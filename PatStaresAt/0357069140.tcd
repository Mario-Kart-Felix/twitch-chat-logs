[0:04:59] <+kiiiirsten> Fallout 3 was good until NV came out
[0:05:00] <Dastardry> Sure this will work as background track for Dead Cells
[0:05:01] <UrsaMinor222> I liked fallout 3
[0:05:02] <derap41> Great another year with you assholes

[0:05:04] <Sparty9112> Pat Streaming makes me wish for a nuclear winter. Happy new year.
[0:05:05] <delighteddemise> I liked the zeta alien thing
[0:05:05] <%CapnCarnivore> @FrankClassic I'd put NV ahead of 2 and Tactics right after 1 but otherwise that list is true
[0:05:06] <%presidentpres> Fallout 3 is FINE. Just not as good as NV.
[0:05:06] <AirlineFood74> Glad to see the Fallout race war has started in chat
[0:05:07] <+crunchygrl> fallout 3 sure was a video game
[0:05:07] <%OwlLightningMage> I also like Fallout 3 a lot
[0:05:10] <FrankClassic> didnt say it was bad, just not near the best
[0:05:13] <derap41> Fallout 3 is good but NV is better
[0:05:13] <+ghostraidert65> HELLO! That cat everyone saw coming out of the lucky 38, that was you?
[0:05:14] <TalisKanju> @rogueknightxiii Yes, exactly. It was so chill

[0:05:18] <%thewinged7> apatBig apatHoldon apatWhat
[0:05:19] <%OwlLightningMage> We can all agree that Fallout 4 is trash
[0:05:19] <jobbedbone> please spoonfeed me song name. I must be blind
[0:05:21] <vingadivo> hell ye
[0:05:22] <MatheusSipolatti> Am I late for the Fallout hate war?
[0:05:23] <Grimmjay222> Fallout 3 better then all other fallout games
[0:05:24] <TrafficCohen> Time to reinstall Fallout one FIXT
[0:05:25] <AllTheZibas> Chat will pat make a fatal slip at some point?
[0:05:29] <%TheDude8D> get ready for a optimize build stream
[0:05:29] <AirlineFood74> @MatheusSipolatti right on time
[0:05:30] <dukenux> Fallout 3 is alrightish, but kinda fizzlea out on the way
[0:05:32] <delighteddemise> yeah fallout 4 was pretty bad
[0:05:32] <radical_skeleton> fallout 3 was fun but new vegas is superior in every way except for bugs
[0:05:33] <MatheusSipolatti> Fuck yeah
[0:05:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer200 Moobot is being racist against the people of Patistan and our native tongue of hype shouting. Our all caps culture will not be suppressed!
[0:05:34] <%Dragonfang1337> jermaJup1 jermaJup2
[0:05:34] <+crunchygrl> i have like 1800 hours logged in nv i think i have some kind of disorder
[0:05:35] <BallinArbiter> Fallout 3 was fine. But it didn’t make any sense
[0:05:36] <retro_redux> Big smarts big lucks. Lucky Ted?
[0:05:36] <%Dragonfang1337> jermaJup3 jermaJup4
[0:05:36] <%ElenaManetta> Fallout 4 would have to be irredeemable to be trash.
[0:05:36] <+AkronymCLT> Fallout 3 is good but the opening is too god damn long
[0:05:38] <$antibonehurtingjuice> Fallout 76 > Fallout 1, 2& new vegas
[0:05:38] <ZNC1990> you'll cowards don't even smoke FO3
[0:05:38] <%Dragonfang1337> heck
[0:05:38] <MatheusSipolatti> Fallout 3 is for babies
[0:05:39] <majima666> fallout 4 was ok.......but even then it was showing its age
[0:05:40] <derap41> NOW THIS IS EPIC
[0:05:41] <HellboundHeartless> 3 was pretty good ,but I think NV really improved on everything from it
[0:05:43] <Ropcord> fallout 4 > fallout 3
[0:05:43] <yeetdabsenpai69> @AllTheZibas yes of course
[0:05:44] <%mister___doctor> Wtf is wrong with liking both 3 and NV
[0:05:45] <%ElenaManetta> Fallout 4 has cool towns, characters, weapons
[0:05:46] <%CapnCarnivore> Fallout 3 had damn good DLC, but the main game sucked
[0:05:47] <%snow_bush> He'll try to take the stranger with the big iron on his hip
[0:05:47] <TrafficCohen> New Vegas is a better game but I like 3 more
[0:05:48] <%Solidnick18> Hi
[0:05:50] <%ElenaManetta> It's just faulty compared to prev versions
[0:05:52] <Coystick> >2019 >Choosing the Bear over the Bull. I sure hope none of you do this.
[0:05:54] <siamzero94> Is there a strawpoll on how many crashes will happen?
[0:05:54] <xxbowmanxx02> nice jerma emote
[0:05:56] <jenkind1> I still like Fallout 3 though
[0:05:57] <%umbypokochan> i hope he doesn't make us sit through all the npc dialogue.. there's waaaay too much
[0:05:59] <%OwlLightningMage> Fallout 3 is way better than 4
[0:06:01] <derap41> fallout 4 is not better than 3
[0:06:03] <AggsMK7> Legion a SHIT
[0:06:03] <LtSergei> Fatboy Vin
[0:06:05] <cacophanes> I'm taking bets whether NV will bug out and Pat will switch games. COME ON PEOPLE DADDY NEEDS NEW YEAR'S MONEY
[0:06:06] <TrafficCohen> >Choosing the Bull
[0:06:06] <%CapnCarnivore> @Coystick >picking either

[0:06:21] <graemecrackers1> HOLD ON
[0:06:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Best Fallout is Van Buren by the way
[0:06:22] <aerdus01> will Bethesda ever make a new game engine, more at 6
[0:06:23] <MatheusSipolatti> You can't really compare F3 to 4, it's like comparing wet trash to regular trash
[0:06:23] <calistarios> But that Outer Worlds burn obsidian did to bethesda... ow delicious
[0:06:24] <dukenux> Were not gonna go quietly, the Legion can count on that.
[0:06:25] <TrafficCohen> 76 is the worst
[0:06:27] <%cdrom321> I'm playing Fallout 3 right now and every time I think I remember something in-game, I get confused as to whether what I'm remembering 3 or New Vegas.
[0:06:27] <ShoggothLord> Yoooooo!
[0:06:29] <%umbypokochan> LILY OR GTFO
[0:06:29] <%Romulus1213> hold on guys
[0:06:32] <AirlineFood74> Fallout 3/4 try to force your investment with "BUT UR SON/DAD THOUGH" and it turns me away from them
[0:06:33] <Lilgamba> I'm having trouble with New Vegas on my PC. There's like an eternal loading screen loop whenever I try to load a save
[0:06:34] <HellboundHeartless> What in the god damn...?
[0:06:34] <FrankClassic> I think I dumped more hours into NV than any other game, save Pokemon
[0:06:35] <AmericanaRed> The idea of fallout is awesome the execution is awful
[0:06:35] <TrafficCohen> 76 MAY HAVE KILLED BETH

[0:06:37] <%DONGWAVE> To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day. Hardly spoke to folks around him, didnt have too much to say. No one dared to ask his business no one dared to make a slip the stranger there among them had a BIG IRON on his hip
[0:06:38] <unitaryfool> we dont speak of 76 hear

[0:06:46] <delighteddemise> isnt 76 basically elder scrolls online?
[0:06:49] <%Fox_Rezard> Sorry, Fallout 3 is the superior game, as someone who only watched, 3 had much more in depth decision making based on your stats

[0:07:01] <%CapnCarnivore> @splucher he fucking better, he's going small guns
[0:07:02] <AirlineFood74> @delighteddemise fallout 4 but online and BIG CRIME
[0:07:03] <%OwlLightningMage> @Fox_Rezard I agree with this
[0:07:03] <MatheusSipolatti> 3 > in-depth decision making
[0:07:04] <NoctisxMog> I can't hear 'hold on' without feeling like i'm already done with life

[0:07:11] <zaptar13> Can I enjoy 4 as an FPS game if I don't care about the RPG elements?
[0:07:11] <Coystick> Best ending is Courier stays in Goodsprings with Sunny and starts a family with her and protects her Smiles
[0:07:12] <romanticzomedy> @chancho4tierra same tbh
[0:07:15] <aerdus01> JINGLE JANGLE JINGLE

[0:07:28] <$antibonehurtingjuice> Fallout 76 is the most immersive RPG ive ever played
[0:07:28] <artoflec> hi everyone o/
[0:07:29] <+NiktenKing> ESO is at least a competent online experience
[0:07:29] <Desertfishing> Pat should go with ceasar
[0:07:31] <xeros720> 4 has so much inventory bs, there's no ignoring it
[0:07:32] <%snow_bush> Legion did nothing wrong.
[0:07:32] <MatheusSipolatti> I remember choosing either to be Jesus or the Devil in 3
[0:07:33] <AirlineFood74> Without quest NPCs* F76 still has NPCs

[0:07:33] <%Shady_Zaku> apatBig apatDab
[0:07:34] <%OwlLightningMage> We can all agree that Fallout 4 is the worst one LUL
[0:07:35] <derap41> OK best NV song is clearly big iron tho
[0:07:37] <delighteddemise> oh God that sounds terrible @airlinefood74
[0:07:38] <%ElenaManetta> Fallout NV was my first Fallout/Bethesda game ever and those games are way more magical and immersion-inducing when you aren't aware of their reputation of being buggy as hell games
[0:07:39] <%CapnCarnivore> fuck off with yall weak ass FO3 shit

[0:34:01] <+Cluetevrelix> No one gives a darn on new years

[0:34:05] <anotheronionguy> Pat >
[0:34:06] <SubjectX07x> As long as you have a proper backstop it is legal. @angriestpat
[0:34:07] <leinadtonu> Sorry officer, Pat told me to do it.
[0:34:08] <energywarning> put a condom on your gun. remember: shoot responsibly
[0:34:09] <TaliTenenbaum> I'm scared of flying but i wanna travel what do
[0:34:09] <%DONGWAVE> @AngriestPat Its legal to shoot on your own land in most states
[0:34:09] <$spleekle> In Texas, it's illegal NOT to shoot your gun daily
[0:34:10] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@danknugglit) (warning)
[0:34:11] <%Triforce505> If you own the land, and you know what your doing, and make sure you're hitting a bullet stop, than it's all legal
[0:34:12] <OrochiSheewa> shoot someone responsible, okay Kappa
[0:34:14] <%TheMattman1313> I mean if it's on your land in the middle of nowhere then it's usually completely legal.
[0:34:15] <HellboundHeartless> Obey the law or Mom will get mad!
[0:34:16] <+Dovakhin573> Man as someone who lives in texas fuck the pieces of shit that shoot guns in their house during new years as im also sure there are not legally owned guns too
[0:34:16] <+ssulcer> Pat it’s fine that’s what we do my dads a cop just live out in the boonies
[0:34:17] <AnAsianToaster> it's a pretty even split tbh
[0:34:17] <valachi> Also you have to alert the authorities too.
[0:34:18] <Darthkitten_Prime> If it's your land, I'm pretty sure it's legal. People go hunting and stuff all the time.
[0:34:19] <%frankthetank285> shooting a car in a field is the best
[0:34:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> There would be no crime, 'cause everybody'd have a gun
[0:34:22] <dukenux> its legal from 23:00-1:00 Kappa
[0:34:22] <alrobot2014> something about installing mods makes me happier than playing the game itself
[0:34:23] <Them00n> @AngriestPat Have you played new california?
[0:34:25] <demonhunter790> Does he mean that literally ?
[0:34:26] <dekkitout> that is 80% of my skyrim experience
[0:34:27] <%ElenaManetta> I must be alone in not even bothering with mods. The game has enough shit and I only play for days at a time.
[0:34:28] <Coystick> I do the same with Dark Souls build planners
[0:34:32] <+greenfall> its fine if you own the land or have permission

[0:34:45] <+Gatzarlok> I go out to the middle of no where when ever I go target shooting. Cheaper than a range, and you don't have to deal with people

[1:32:05] <alrobot2014> Kappa

[1:43:08] <%crimsonharvest> I'd turn that up to like 4 minutes
[1:43:11] <mercado94> make it save every 1 minute
[1:43:11] <%KevinsLunchbox> a mod for fallout isnt working? color me shocked
[1:43:11] <+KanjiTatsumi> It just said CASM quicksaved the game though
[1:43:12] <HellboundHeartless> show bob and big iron

[1:43:37] <CertainlySyrix> You don't need em when you got Casm anyways.

[1:43:44] <%KevinsLunchbox> Pat did you download the uterus hunting mod?
[1:43:45] <PSI_Guy95> Do the default autosave and the mod not play nice?
[1:43:46] <FlyguyJP> Pat needs autosaving or we know what will happen.
[1:43:47] <romanticzomedy> Can confirm, turning off most autosaves in NV does help with stability
[1:43:47] <FauxGateau> i admire their purity
[1:43:48] <mercado94> do a nuzlocke run
[1:43:49] <%Shady_Zaku> You made a fatal slip when you tried to best the fanbase with the big iron on its hip

[2:23:53] <$codussalpha> @AngriestPat there are skill books that give a +1 to a stat perm, and skill mags that are +10 temp. ammo recycleing is using a reloading bench to breakdown and remake ammo into different types
[2:23:54] <+MisterCrimson> @AngriestPat ammo recycling is time consuming and pointless considering how cheap ammo is in this game
[2:23:54] <Desertfishing> erhmahgawdplayhowiwantyoutoplay
[2:23:56] <%Agami23> they make pat say, i dont know how to play the video game

[2:24:16] <FauxGateau> good
[2:24:17] <@StridentSong> Magazines are temporary, and last for 5 minutes. Books are permanent. You can tell the difference by looking at the amount of plus to the stat that it provides. Mags will give +10(20 if perked), Books give +2(4 if perked)
[2:24:18] <Yummy_Nukes> @angriestpat you can pick up bullet cases and reuse them to make more ammo
[2:24:19] <FauxGateau> don't
[2:24:19] <%TheDude8D> go to ammo bench

[2:52:26] <+DonnyJaBronie> 3 is fine
[2:52:26] <corepool> 3 is good 4 is bad
[2:52:26] <Sofa_King_Hype> He just wants to sell car insurance
[2:52:26] <sirjonston> the story is boring and the world is ugly
[2:52:27] <clockwork000> 3 has so really cool vistas
[2:52:28] <%DavidSanChan> having a torso?
[2:52:28] <zeepyrus> LET THEM FIGHT
[2:52:28] <%OwlLightningMage> 3 is good 4 is bad
[2:52:29] <%SudoKillUser> It’s not good
[2:52:29] <Moisthoodie> 4 is the bad one
[2:52:29] <%Keyd00d> I have no strong opinions about 3
[2:52:29] <Grayhammatter> shattered ribs
[2:52:29] <%homelesstwinky> 3 is great and has the best atmosphere
[2:52:29] <Shastafield> yikes
[2:52:30] <Iceyproned> 4 is worse
[2:52:30] <reiju_22> :) I liked 3
[2:52:30] <Fujiwara_92> 3 is bed
[2:52:30] <+TheRealVegerot> 3 is okay, 4 is bad, 4vr is okay if ur pc is op
[2:52:30] <rararasputino> 3 is garbage, and here's why
[2:52:30] <+ilasper1> 4 is trash 3 was okay
[2:52:30] <DrMoose7> 3 is ok, 4 is bad
[2:52:30] <+Bloodxb> you break a rib
[2:52:31] <+Freelance_Astronaut> 3 has more interesting exploration
[2:52:31] <FauxGateau> 3 is fine now
[2:52:32] <CptBritches> 4 is bad, 3 is just overrated
[2:52:32] <%pimpinahz> anything after this fallout sux
[2:52:32] <%aishman> 3 is a-oaky
[2:52:34] <JittersCaffeine> I super hate the cinematic kill camera
[2:52:34] <clockwork000> 4 is poopie
[2:52:34] <calistarios> 1&2 are best
[2:52:34] <+deliciousmocha> 3 just isn't as good as New Vegas
[2:52:35] <%aishman> 4 is a trashfire.
[2:52:35] <%dickbuttwoman> It lowers end or something
[2:52:35] <+Daidis> i liked fallout 76
[2:52:35] <sirjonston> 4 is also bad
[2:52:35] <Zombrocom> broken ribs?
[2:52:35] <+SpectralShot> 4 is bad. 3 is good
[2:52:35] <laguerrilha> 3>>>>>4
[2:52:36] <vingadivo> mediocre
[2:52:36] <majima666> might be an obsidian title but bethesda was still in charge of it
[2:52:36] <KeystoneA1> 4 and 76 are garbo
[2:52:36] <+CrazyJakeoo7> 3 is good
[2:52:37] <%ryome> defend 3's ending
[2:52:37] <tinypouf> yeah 4 is pretty shit
[2:52:37] <%lizard0tm> 3 is alright
[2:52:37] <%Gogogolem> 76 is a bad game
[2:52:37] <+cerberuscarmine> yep
[2:52:37] <+DAREALGUMMY> 4 is a good game but bad fallout
[2:52:37] <derap41> 4 made me want to die
[2:52:38] <+smargh1015> true
[2:52:38] <dukenux> bur now is pretty lame
[2:52:38] <dekkitout> was it bad for its time, nope, is it janky now sure
[2:52:38] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat is right for once LUL
[2:52:38] <zafooru> 3s end will always leave a bad taste in my mouth but I liked the midgame
[2:52:39] <+gearcannon> it all right
[2:52:39] <%Fruitywhompus> theyre all bad games
[2:52:39] <+Blankets_and_Tea> 4 is a bad RPG, not a bad game
[2:52:39] <GarbageQueenEllie> Fallout is a BAD GAME
[2:52:39] <simulationbard> 3's good fuck off
[2:52:39] <JittersCaffeine> 4 was boring
[2:52:40] <ape_hawk> and 76 is a lawsuit
[2:52:40] <%SudoKillUser> 4 is worse
[2:52:40] <+WilderWolfMan> almost time for Auld lang syne
[2:52:41] <+boredpantz> 3 is better then 4 but 3 is like ok at the most
[2:52:41] <matrignomy7> NO FIGHTING
[2:52:41] <BrunoBeeftip> 3 is like if new vegas didn't have good writing to make up for how busted it is
[2:52:41] <Darren716> 4 is fine
[2:52:41] <calistarios> then new vegas
[2:52:42] <Gruhunchously> 3 is a fine Bethesda game, but a disappointing Fallout game.
[2:52:42] <%SuttonOMEGA> i saw a one hour video saying it was bad, therefore its bad haHAA
[2:52:42] <jijipose> Play 76, Pat. I want to see you suffer
[2:52:42] <inz0mbiac> 4 is mediocre
[2:52:42] <Zombrocom> if 4 is bad, what is 76?
[2:52:42] <%ElenaManetta> LIAR 4 is fine it's ALSO flawed
[2:52:42] <Schedrevka> 3 is bad, 4 is awful
[2:52:42] <DSD24> 4 has the worst storuy
[2:52:42] <Graywolf_the_45th> 3 is alright. 4's the one that sucks
[2:52:42] <+ChaosVulpes> Wouldn't a crippled torso just mean your organs are failing and you're slowly dying???
[2:52:43] <%radda343> christ you people are cynical
[2:52:43] <+kimo313> 4 is AWFUL
[2:52:43] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat gets it
[2:52:43] <$Chimeraelite> 4 is bad, 3 is fun, NV is great
[2:52:44] <DrMoose7> it did not
[2:52:44] <%TheSpiritof2277> 3's alright compared to 4
[2:52:44] <%mastamasquer> bullshit
[2:52:45] <%NovaKnightmare> 4 has the best gunplay worst everything fucking else
[2:52:45] <Conky89> 3 suffers from Bethesda writing. Might as well rename the Brotherhood of Steel the Power Rangers.
[2:52:45] <jman13131313> 3 is ok
[2:52:46] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> This game did its best
[2:52:46] <+CuttleCrow> 4 is depressing, 3 is lame, 76 is just fucking terrible
[2:52:47] <+Freelance_Astronaut> 76 never existed
[2:52:47] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> People WILDLY exaggerate the difference between this and 3
[2:52:48] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> 1 and 2 are the best anyway
[2:52:48] <Iceyproned> 76 isnt a game
[2:52:48] <derap41> it made me sad
[2:52:48] <%badchoice5> I thought 4 was just sadly mediocre?
[2:52:49] <$birdfella> Far harbor is good though
[2:52:49] <Etherealizer> 4 was a bad fallout but a decent game lol
[2:52:49] <%jaggiesama> he's right
[2:52:50] <%DarkSodaMcFaceHead> 3 is just a very different taste from 1,2, and Vegas
[2:52:50] <Darren716> I had fun with 4
[2:52:50] <TikanZK> 4 was really good shooting wise though
[2:52:51] <$cerass> it did not do its best
[2:52:51] <%OwlLightningMage> 3 is good 4 is actually bad
[2:52:51] <+Nomicro4u> could have been worse lol
[2:52:51] <Geassmaster5> 4 is soulless garbage
[2:52:51] <+mcjimbo12> Holy shot people in chat are actually saying fallout 3 is bad? This is blowing my GODDAMN MIND
[2:52:52] <%KevinsLunchbox> Fallout 76 is the shining peak of all Fallout games
[2:52:52] <alcors_wisdom> fallout peaked in highschool
[2:52:52] <BallinArbiter> I hate 4 so much
[2:52:53] <majima666> 4 was ok.....nothing more, nothing less
[2:52:55] <HappyCutePhoenix> 4 is trash
[2:52:55] <calistarios> The Outer World
[2:52:55] <%mastamasquer> 4 is A FUN GAME
[2:52:55] <+cerberuscarmine> what about 76 tho pat! Kappa
[2:52:56] <%snow_bush> 4 is a decent game but a BAD Fallout game
[2:52:58] <heybenice> Oh no I crippled my torso
[2:52:58] <A_mere_shrubb> 4 was good
[2:52:58] <%Keyd00d> There are more bad Fallouts than good
[2:52:58] <+CuttleCrow> 1 and 2 are classics
[2:53:00] <%brave_sj> 3 is better than 4, but that doesn't mean it's good
[2:53:00] <+DonnyJaBronie> 76 is my favorite fallout game
[2:53:00] <$Niney_Who> I actually don't like 4's shooting ama
[2:53:00] <%mastamasquer> but a bad fallout
[2:53:01] <rudybrossard> Fallout 4 is fine, it's just the story that sucks
[2:53:01] <$SGrim> 4 added the best interpretation of power armor to date. Nothing else.
[2:53:02] <+dragoon001914> 4 has good gunplay and nothing else. 3 has an awful patchwork of a map and a horrific story.
[2:53:02] <%ElenaManetta> The only actual bad Fallout game is 76 because it's fucking unplayable
[2:53:04] <clockwork000> 4 makes me feel sad playing it.
[2:53:04] <reiju_22> 76 PogChamp
[2:53:04] <dukenux> they great but Ooooooold
[2:53:06] <%Fidel_Castbro> Fuck you NCR
[2:53:07] <RollCritFail> 3 is good, but the PC version (at least the steam one) is super busted
[2:53:07] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> 1 & 2 are trash
[2:53:07] <Quentinmr> SHOOT HIM
[2:53:09] <%ryome> DEFEND 3 PAT
[2:53:09] <%NovaKnightmare> Fallout 76 is the GOAT
[2:53:09] <zeepyrus> 4 was pretty bad
[2:53:09] <nofestu2> NCR
[2:53:10] <+VideoVillain20> 3 is just dated, a product of its time, its fine
[2:53:11] <Quentinmr> SHOOT HIM DEAD
[2:53:11] <Fujiwara_92> 4 is mediocre and that makes it bad
[2:53:11] <+deliciousmocha> 4 tries to be New Vegas and forgets midway through the plot what that even means.
[2:53:12] <dukenux> and tgey feel ooooooold
[2:53:13] <ASadFrog> New Vegas made 3 look bad, but 4 made 3 look okay. It's like how RE6 made 5 look okay.
[2:53:13] <zafooru> i managed to get some momentum going in 1 and had fun with it but i dropped off it after a bit
[2:53:13] <$Niney_Who> """Hiding"""
[2:53:13] <Gieron666> new vegas is good cuz different developers made it, not lazy bethezda

[2:53:16] <siamzero94> 1 & 2 is pure jank not for everyone
[2:53:17] <RichAnvils> 4s downfall was getting tied to the voice acting for the PC
[2:53:17] <+ilasper1> FUCK YOU PIGGGG

[2:54:29] <zafooru> the grampa scrolls, bolivia
[2:54:30] <%yoshkosh20> all the npcs look like they jumped into a vat of oil. it's kinda unsettling

[2:54:33] <+VanaSkiller> what
[2:54:34] <alcors_wisdom> @colmsball id put NV at the top personally but thats mostly because im not a fan of top down rts in general
[2:54:35] <$Chimeraelite> Oblivion is THE SHIT
[2:54:35] <derap41> its also not that good
[2:54:36] <%TheSpiritof2277> let's get to bashing butts

[2:54:40] <lloyddboy> HAVE YOU HEARD
[2:54:40] <Flunkorg> If new vegas didn't exist they'rd be one less shitty fallout game.
[2:54:40] <+cerberuscarmine> the best elder scrolls game
[2:54:41] <$Chimeraelite> THE MUSIC IS AMAZING
[2:54:42] <%VRNK> oblivion came out like 15 years ago
[2:54:43] <TafferAA> nostalgia for oblivion LuL
[2:54:44] <$Piemono> the Deadra Gates were fucking terrible though
[2:54:45] <mercado94> UN FORASTERO
[2:54:46] <Grayhammatter> oblivion is the best, bur at the same time the worst
[2:54:46] <foreverN2dust> Its fallout with swords
[2:54:46] <Fujiwara_92> PAY THE COURT A FINE OR SERVE YOUR SERVICE k
[2:54:48] <$antibonehurtingjuice> ITS GETTING THERE
[2:54:49] <Belutima> 20 years ago
[2:54:49] <%VRNK> MORROWIND came out 19 years ago
[2:54:50] <dekkitout> like 20 if you round up
[2:54:50] <calistarios> oblivion was ugly as shit
[2:54:50] <+SilverDevilfish> You took money from a chest in that house and I knew even though I was outside! Stop right there criminal scum!
[2:54:51] <+TheRealVegerot> oblivion is actually good tbh
[2:54:51] <Yadogari> I FUCKING LOVE MORROWIND
[2:54:51] <Conky89> Hopefully Obsidian will not get screwed over by the publisher with Outer Worlds. That has always been an issue with Obsidian.
[2:54:52] <simulationbard> WHY! WON'T! YOU! DIE!
[2:54:53] <+WierTheTraveler> 20 years ago in the y2k era
[2:54:53] <%vaporousTippler> Morrowind is playable in OpenMW
[2:54:53] <PSI_Guy95> DO bother!
[2:54:53] <Psyramics> so is oblivion
[2:54:53] <+dragoon001914> Oblivion seemed cool but the level scaling is fucking awful.
[2:54:55] <XdaXcaptainX> MORROWIND IS ARt
[2:54:55] <zafooru> i cant go back to oblivion, but morrowind will always be fun to me
[2:54:55] <%SiameseSneeze> Oblivion is one of my favorite games of all time
[2:54:56] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Oh God, I'm so old...still younger than Paige tho. StoneLightning
[2:54:56] <radical_skeleton> morrowind is fun as hell but it's too janky
[2:54:56] <rararasputino> They are wrong
[2:54:56] <BlueLunecy> DO bother, it was good
[2:54:56] <fruit_pie_the_magician> What was that, 05, 06?
[2:54:56] <CaptainFrankincense> WHAT
[2:54:57] <CashewZero> Obviously he was rounding to the nearest 20 you dolts
[2:54:58] <$Niney_Who> @AngriestPat Fun Fact: oblivion's voice acting is so bad because lines are recorded in Alphabetical Order
[2:54:58] <+ilasper1> damn I was panicing hard thinking it did come out 20 years ago
[2:54:58] <poweredscoot> 15-20 might as well be 20
[2:54:58] <+Freelance_Astronaut> Oblivion is older then the majority of fortnite fans
[2:54:58] <%sparrrow_> No quest marker in Morrowind
[2:54:59] <dekkitout> try daggerfal -DONT- ResidentSleeper
[2:55:00] <%JJCheeker> I love the world of out in Morrow wind
[2:55:00] <+hoenhime344> IF YOU LIKE OLD SCHOOL GAMEPLAY play morrowing
[2:55:00] <derap41> then you won't like morrowind
[2:55:01] <%umbypokochan> oblivion is spoopy and hilarious at the same time
[2:55:01] <rararasputino> Morrowind is good
[2:55:02] <Nekros4442> Hey Pat, have you heard if Pathfinder Kingmaker has become not buggy as hell yet? I've still waiting on it
[2:55:02] <freedomREMM> stop stealing
[2:55:02] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@alrobot2014) (warning)
[2:55:03] <%vaporousTippler> But then I'm literally playing Daggerfall.
[2:55:03] <$SGrim> 12 years
[2:55:04] <%RaikenTB> TOO HUEG
[2:55:05] <%spacekataz18> Morrowind's great but big old
[2:55:05] <agiantpileoftrash> get cliff racerd
[2:55:06] <%brave_sj> That would require work
[2:55:07] <CrypticMochi> I hate how 4 ripes off story stuff from 3 and NV, also fuck Shaun
[2:55:08] <%rumuloh> People who say don't bother are scum
[2:55:08] <%badchoice5> Morrowind is a game that is happy to be broken by the player
[2:55:08] <Etherealizer> who is telling you don't bother I will fight them
[2:55:09] <Fujiwara_92> do bother paige
[2:55:09] <ClarkWasHere> morrowind can be tough at first, but you'll get into a groove eventually
[2:55:10] <+Saint__Crota> Morrowind is the big dick of the series
[2:55:11] <%NovaKnightmare> by the NINE, ASSAULT!!
[2:55:12] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> they wont even make a new engine, remaster it in what?
[2:55:12] <+CuttleCrow> 23 years ago...OH NO
[2:55:12] <$SGrim> It came out in 2006. Fuck
[2:55:12] <+ChaosVulpes> They can't remaster Oblivion, they're too busy porting Skyrim!
[2:55:13] <%TheGreatBamBe> 06
[2:55:14] <dsauce999> SKYBLIVION
[2:55:15] <%ahegotrigger> daggerfell is cool
[2:55:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> i was 9
[2:55:17] <Inebriateddonut> There's Skywind and Skyblivion
[2:55:18] <rararasputino> Round up from 12.5
[2:55:19] <%DarkSodaMcFaceHead> Arena was unplayable at the time. Now it's a sick joke.
[2:55:20] <roflwaffleauthoritah> Morrowind is great if you can get over the jank because you have full fucking freedom
[2:55:21] <+dragoon001914> Morrowind LOOKS like trash but if you understand dicerolls for combat then the gameplay isn't terrible.
[2:55:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> 99
[2:55:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oblivion feels kinda lonely sometimes. I dunno
[2:55:24] <Zathas> 2 sucked in the early game. The difficulty of the random events + their... randomness, could screw you over early on especially since most characters hadn't gotten any decent gear or skill buildup at that point. Plus, it went heavy into some goofy shit, which is fine, but the inclusion of ghosts in a game that I feel is mostly sciencefiction, not supernatural, was too far. Although, I liked the Lovecraft reference from Fallout 3. But that at least could be explained in-game by some hand waving.
[2:55:24] <%sparrrow_> 90s
[2:55:24] <DaBigVitus> "Why you gotta bring up old shit?"
[2:55:25] <TikanZK> who cares
[2:55:25] <nofestu2> WHY WONT YOU DIE!
[2:55:26] <%skybriel1> Morrowind is fucking great but its goddamn old as shit
[2:55:26] <%brave_sj> LuL
[2:55:27] <derap41> Arean is still the best
[2:55:27] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat 99
[2:55:27] <+SpectralShot> Morrowind is hard to get into if you didn't play it before
[2:55:30] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> LMAO

[2:55:30] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> WutFace

[2:55:34] <majima666> i had the xbox port of morrowind....hated it. but those sorts of settings have never been my thing
[2:55:34] <Etherealizer> They redid the engine with OpenMW to be more modern so its super playable now
[2:55:36] <%lizard0tm> @AngriestPat Skyblivion is a fan made remaster for Oblivion in Skyrim, it looks great
[2:55:37] <spacecatstreams> mmm spiked eggong

[2:55:37] <$antibonehurtingjuice> CLIPPING
[2:55:38] <%WannabeHobo> looking foreward to the Skywind mod
[2:55:38] <randomp141> Morrowind isn't like Oblivion Paige, it's good if you're willing to slam your head against the wall but unless you know this skip it
[2:55:38] <majima666> thats why i liked fallout
[2:55:40] <%NovaKnightmare> Is that Liquid?
[2:55:40] <tinypouf> sergeant mcgee omg

[2:55:40] <$Niney_Who> I like how this game has 2 voice actors
[2:55:40] <KRSG> So you guys see the compass. The red that is in frame is in such a position that I keep thinking it's an enemy.

[2:55:42] <HellboundHeartless> Hi Liam!
[2:55:44] <RollCritFail> I thought Morrowind was either 2000 or 2001

[2:55:47] <Yellowoboe> Oof the clipping
[2:55:48] <Fujiwara_92> LIAM OBRIAN
[2:55:49] <%PipIV> Skyrim will be ported to Jelly before Oblivion gets remastered

[2:55:50] <JumboMan214> Liam OBrien
[2:55:50] <%vaporousTippler> OpenMW and Daggerfall Unity are officially The Shit.

[2:55:52] <FauxGateau> LIam o' liquid?
[2:55:52] <+risenlp2> Sergeant Liam O'Brian!
[2:55:52] <%Nobrev> I'd say you could play morrowind as long as ypu go into it knowing you're playing a super dated game
[2:55:53] <%NovaKnightmare> me dumb
[2:55:54] <siamzero94> a that fallout 1 ambience

[2:55:57] <%OwlLightningMage> It's crazy that a new Fallout game hasn't come out since New Vegas Kappa
[2:55:59] <alcors_wisdom> that face mod isnt great
[2:55:59] <%colmsball> @alcors_wisdom fair enough. to each their owm. 2 was my first pc game so it has a special place in my heart
[2:55:59] <dukenux> I know what Hub isssss
[2:55:59] <calistarios> Hi liam
[2:56:00] <+Solutha> Man the Hub was a SHIT HOLE
[2:56:01] <redwilt> Don't let it set in
[2:56:02] <+mcjimbo12> Oh look it’s Liam 1 of 5000
[2:56:04] <dekkitout> the one think that makes skyrim great is dawnbreaker, the one thing that makes it bad is also dawnbreaker
[2:56:06] <%TheSpiritof2277> One of many Liam O'Brien's in FNV
[2:56:07] <+Freelance_Astronaut> Morrowind is fine until you have to convince the houses and tribes
[2:56:09] <cadlingtongaming> @Zathas I don't remember a ghost in Fallout 2.
[2:56:12] <alrobot2014> Liam O'Brien and Yuri Lowenthal make up so much of this game
[2:56:13] <%SiameseSneeze> Morrowind is 2002
[2:56:15] <Conky89> Can you say: Bureaucracy?
[2:56:16] <FauxGateau> the hub was great? what are you talking about
[2:56:20] <ancrest_tant> Quick shoot yourself in the to summon your persona
[2:56:20] <$Niney_Who> "Pat steals everything that isn't glued down
[2:56:24] <+CuttleCrow> the armor you fatty
[2:56:24] <Oxybe> give pat DA ITEMS
[2:56:24] <%NovaKnightmare> some of ur armor
[2:56:24] <alcors_wisdom> @colmsball NV was my first computer game so probably a bit of that as well
[2:56:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> @dekkitout But the hot vampire waifus!
[2:56:26] <%DarkSodaMcFaceHead> Every Elder Scrolls, the map gets smaller and thus better. Way too spread out.
[2:56:26] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat GO SLEEP WITH LlAM O'BRIEN
[2:56:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> Ok, that was a Drawn Together quote. Curiosity slain.
[2:56:27] <%Fidel_Castbro> the only thing good about the NCR is that they have a wicked Sick Duster
[2:56:28] <%Reizie_Etherealm> If there is one good thing about Pat, it's that he doesn't discriminate who he steals from
[2:56:30] <derap41> faction armor is heavy
[2:56:33] <tinypouf> overheavied
[2:56:33] <CaptainFrankincense> morrowind fucks up dumb people who cant follow instructions really hard
[2:56:33] <$birdfella> Pat, would you please find and wear a dang cowboy hat?
[2:56:33] <zerocruz> What’s the point of karma again ?
[2:56:33] <%RaikenTB> take a DOOMP
[2:56:35] <laguerrilha> Wait is this hardcore mode?
[2:56:36] <%mister___doctor> I much prefer Fallout 4 to 3 because 4 doesnt play like chlamydia
[2:56:36] <dekkitout> serana will be fine
[2:56:36] <murp___> why wpuld you never take the case its 0 weight its literally free money
[2:56:36] <Grayhammatter> read the book
[2:56:36] <calistarios> Remember to drink when you hear Liam, Yuri or Mat.
[2:56:37] <DaBigVitus> big heavies for small pats
[2:56:40] <reasonance> by far the biggest issue with morrowind is the movement speed, once you "solve" that it's great
[2:56:46] <%Keyd00d> why is pat german
[2:56:46] <rudybrossard> Why are you playing with a controilelr ?
[2:56:48] <%OwlLightningMage> Fallout 4 is so bad it hurts
[2:56:49] <%ahegotrigger> you only need one for a disquise
[2:56:53] <zeepyrus> Go sell your stuff then come back
[2:56:53] <Quentinmr> *kill them all*
[2:56:55] <$Niney_Who> CASM?
[2:57:01] <derap41> He's got the big dick hat
[2:57:07] <%manwithboxonhead> Morrowind is a game that awed me back when I was 10-12 years old.
[2:57:08] <$Niney_Who> Does Pat have any Mods on?
[2:57:11] <Sofa_King_Hype> I’ve been hearing fireworks for the last two hours. It’s only 10:50
[2:57:13] <alcors_wisdom> theres a shop in the casino pat
[2:57:13] <%rumuloh> Kill these profligates @AngriestPat
[2:57:14] <calistarios> The only good thing about FO4 was the power armour redesign and that you climb into it
[2:57:18] <$birdfella> @Niney_Who It's an autosave mod
[2:57:18] <Inebriateddonut> @Niney_Who He has a few
[2:57:19] <%ahegotrigger> actually the only redeeming thing about legion is being a double agent spy man
[2:57:25] <$Chimeraelite> Those berets are great but fuck they're annoying to shave and shape
[2:57:25] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Niney_Who Yes he's going to post them all on the VODs.
[2:57:26] <%ahegotrigger> but it is really fun to do
[2:57:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> One thing I'll give Morrowind is that the Imperial armor is way better in that than Skyrim. That's why I got that mod for it
[2:57:29] <%OwlLightningMage> @calistarios I agree with this
[2:57:31] <%colmsball> the biggest issue with Morrowind is me being lost for 3 hours trying to find a guy...still a better game than fo4 or skyrim
[2:57:39] <PSI_Guy95> Why not call it Nacraf?
[2:57:39] <%GarbageNirvana> encercef
[2:57:40] <Zathas> @cadlingtongaming Quest goes by the name of "Return Anna's Locket".
[2:57:40] <derap41> Its what 4-5 NCR troopers here?
[2:57:43] <XdaXcaptainX> you dont need to move that fast in morrowind, just enjoy the scenery. its not like its bland and shitty like oblivion, or repetitive and bear ridden like skyrim
[2:57:44] <Gruhunchously> NARCIF
[2:57:46] <%Archer2150> Ill give you a mouthfull
[2:57:47] <corepercentlives> Ncrafrefnc

[2:57:57] <XdaXcaptainX> and its a smaller map, besides
[2:58:04] <DaBigVitus> doesn't that just mean they love coke
[2:58:04] <cadlingtongaming> hmm
[2:58:05] <dukenux> Skyrim is ResidentSleeper
[2:58:06] <+Yokuho> It's not new year for Pat yet is it?

[3:13:42] <%OwlLightningMage> Honest Hearts is the worst one
[3:13:43] <Grayhammatter> h'wile
[3:13:44] <PSI_Guy95> That boy ain't tighy

[3:14:03] <$SGrim> @OwlLightningMage two words: Dead Money
[3:14:03] <%OwlLightningMage> Honest Hearts is the Greed Island of New Vegas DLC LUL
[3:14:03] <Gruhunchously> Honest Heart's main story was lacking, but the Survivalist was legit my favorite part of all New Vegas.
[3:14:03] <+professionaltreeinspector> i liked all the dlc

[3:14:31] <%PipIV> the Survivalist was TOO STRONG
[3:14:31] <alrobot2014> the survivalist is the best dead npc story
[3:14:32] <%Skrypto> *MELK* is the worst, ppl who say melk just die
[3:14:32] <FauxGateau> dead money is still amazing despite the speakers
[3:14:32] <+CuttleCrow> Boggle

[3:15:16] <Gruhunchously> Radscorpion tiddy.
[3:15:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> RADSCORPIAN
[3:15:19] <+Freelance_Astronaut> Dead Money is still better than any of the Fallout 4 DLC
[3:15:19] <Quentinmr> old world blues is the best
[3:15:20] <FauxGateau> way too linear for my taste
[3:15:23] <tinypouf> i like lonesome road but the deathclaws are too spoopy for me

[3:16:09] <FauxGateau> about it
[3:16:10] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat hates Caravan because he loves to be wrong
[3:16:10] <Quentinmr> dead money is pretty good
[3:16:11] <hazardkujacker> @OwlLightningMage I mean, New Vegas Woolie is the best character in the DLCs so
[3:16:12] <zafooru> best dlc for this game was horse armor
[3:16:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You just changed it to keep your distance.

[3:16:33] <%SulfurousAcid> Primm Slim for sheriff
[3:16:34] <%ElenaManetta> I want to mention having an unlimited Flashlight that is also your primary inventory device is so cool
[3:16:34] <%VRNK> dead money was good story-wise but gameplay wise it's not fun

[3:16:45] <boltzthekewlguy> once u choose a slot that's ur slot nuff said
[3:16:45] <+TypicalAnomaly> Funny how they made this postapocalyptic RPG for a caravan game.
[3:16:46] <%deviljhojho94> Be, aggressive
[3:16:46] <hazardkujacker> Dead Money would be better if not for the very beggining

[3:42:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> Anyone ever shoot Eddy on accident? It seems like it'd be really easy to do
[3:42:58] <%Archer2150> @zafooru Theyre dumpsters you can only fit so many items in them!
[3:42:59] <Edwinsag> I burn crackers
[3:42:59] <OkamiDude15> just shoot 4Head

[3:43:15] <%sparrrow_> Because 95% of the dumpster is just a texture
[3:43:16] <threechanz> Imagine actually clearing primm
[3:43:16] <+NightOwlSam> you DID it
[3:43:16] <eaglealden> why isn’t the racist person in chat banned yet?
[3:43:18] <+Nymphonomicon> Use dynamite to explode him and knock the body down.
[3:43:27] <%Archer2150> @jorgamund the rifle hes using is actually a 556 though it sure doesnt kick like it should
[3:43:29] <%deviljhojho94> No mods online i think
[3:43:31] <+Heroes_of_Vale> I have no clue. Mods are asleep
[3:43:33] <AirlineFood74> @eaglealden we're all racist here
[3:43:39] <AirlineFood74> unlss you're being for real

[3:43:55] <%VRNK> you absolutely did not
[3:43:56] <+ChaosVulpes> No one is racist if everyone is racist... just like in Dungeons and Dragons
[3:43:57] <ClarkWasHere> @Archer2150 it was supposed to be a 22 cal rifle not 556 but devs changed it because 556 would be more common
[3:43:59] <+jorgamund> @Archer2150 ah. I saw "varmint rifle" in there and the shots sounded really weak
[3:44:01] <alcors_wisdom> had to take a break from watching pat fucking up NV what did i miss
[3:44:01] <%TheDude8D> what's the stats on that cowboy repeater?
[3:44:02] <drewslo> varamint was originally going to be a 22 rifle
[3:44:04] <%Reizie_Etherealm> He walk like he shat his pants

[3:44:30] <MrPedrovsky> Races must not mix
[3:44:31] <%Archer2150> @ClarkWasHere That makes sense, though I would think 22 would be much more common in an apocolypse
[3:44:31] <DarkPlague20> he was pro scub
[3:44:35] <MrPedrovsky> It is too early
[3:44:36] <Edwinsag> It’s because the mod is a cracker

[3:53:04] <Darren716> To the Highway patrol station
[3:53:06] <Zathas> Effectiveness of repair kits is tied to repair skill.

[3:53:10] <%rumuloh> @AngriestPat more repeater ammo in the sheriffs house
[3:53:19] <DraxTD> @Mr_Strut too many people made him drop it
[3:53:19] <+Dakuu75> 7 is not "precious little ammo" that's like half a clip, that's like, "you're all right" ammo
[3:53:22] <%sparrrow_> It was so weird how they didn't put in a zoom in animation in Fallout 3
[3:53:22] <silvcrest> If only you had some way to have gotten more ammo for this, IF ONLY

[3:53:34] <+VoytekBus> the repeater repeater
[3:53:35] <zafooru> if only you would craft ammo RIP
[3:53:40] <%DONGWAVE> Oh wow you can see the Ruger logo on the 22
[3:53:43] <alcors_wisdom> also dont use the silenced .22 unless youre undetected
[3:53:45] <%sparrrow_> Pat's the sheriff in this town now
[3:53:46] <%OwlLightningMage> If only this game let you make ammo or something crazy like that
[3:53:47] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @GarbageQueenEllie it's expensive

[4:03:30] <zerocruz> Nah 3ds
[4:03:31] <%ArcanumMBD> You know what else is super cheap right now? Mass Effect Andromeda. $5, $7 for the deluxe :D
[4:03:32] <+deliciousmocha> Why would even *touch* my 3DS in 2019?
[4:03:34] <%Malikial> Hollow Knight is 10 on Steam right now.
[4:03:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> Such a Bad Boy
[4:03:35] <OkamiDude15> pay shilling for the 3ds? sfhTHINK what timeline is this?

[4:03:42] <+trueavengercj> i already brought it because of the sale
[4:03:47] <%thedemoninthestorm> I don't even believe in karma, but I still can't bring myself to steal in any game.
[4:03:48] <%Garthunox> do I was to buy nets and pickaxes?
[4:03:49] <ScreamingMeat> Holy shit WHY didn't my notifications tell me Pat was streaming!?

[4:03:57] <Grayhammatter> both
[4:03:59] <$Sayie> Monster Hunter Stories is really fun though and if that is on sale it's worth it!

[4:04:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> midnight EST is all that matters on this stream
[4:04:09] <%sparrrow_> portability is usually worth it
[4:04:09] <%reignbeauxbaer> Switch version is great
[4:04:09] <+Dakuu75> -SSD is better with the load times, ok cool. it wouldn't effect gameplay or fps?
[4:04:10] <%Tarantulawl> Switch version is good
[4:04:11] <%Malikial> Hollow Knight is 10 bucks on steam right now.

[4:04:40] <GarbageQueenEllie> "The bjs were AMAZING"
[4:04:40] <vinarto> When's the next Smash stream?
[4:04:41] <+Daidis> I saw guardians of the galaxy at a drive in
[4:04:42] <ScreamingMeat> Drive-Ins were the shit!
[4:04:42] <+Greenkap> the drie in near me closed down last year
[4:04:45] <%cherubsanonymous> It's the CIIIIRCLE IN MY ASS
[4:04:45] <Darren716> I saw Finding Nemo at a drive in
[4:04:46] <yautja_butts> Drive ins are for sex in cars
[4:04:47] <+deliciousmocha> OKLAHOMA IS NOT- oh wait we totally are cowboys.
[4:04:48] <heybenice> I saw Hercules
[4:04:49] <CptBritches> Drive ins have nothing to do with cowboys
[4:04:51] <+Daidis> for like, $5
[4:04:52] <ArcticAsylum> It sucks now cause everyone has their cars on, fucking, and you cant hear the movie lol
[4:04:52] <Endocrom> I saw Wateworld and Apollo 13 in a drive in
[4:04:52] <Joestar1890> Does Pat know about Cass?
[4:04:53] <FracturedImage> T E X T U R E S
[4:04:53] <%jiin6> do you like metroidvania's? is what you should be asking, if yes give it a go
[4:04:55] <%TheSpiritof2277> cowboy cartoons are great tho jermaPluto
[4:04:55] <MrPedrovsky> @arcanummbd Timezones are government lies in order to dwarf the magnificence of timecube
[4:04:55] <%Mr_y1096> formative FURRY experience
[4:04:58] <madogod> why dont you play the superior fallout game? fallout 76 Kappa
[4:04:59] <future_famous_person> i too saw hercules
[4:04:59] <romanticzomedy> Lonesome Road lads
[4:05:00] <Chaoko99> @Dakuu75 A lot of games will dynamically load and unload assets. HAving a SSD helps. ARMA 3 is an example of NEEDING one due to to how the game is optimized. Games load outside of loading screens too.
[4:05:00] <%Malikial> Yeah, but PC is better, @doc_ock_rokc
[4:05:00] <ScreamingMeat> I saw Lilo & Stitch at a drive in
[4:05:01] <%ThePuddingDead> another hour for me
[4:05:02] <DXLelouch24> Pat im from the south, i will find you and insult your intelligence infront of everyone and God
[4:05:03] <%MelBrooksKA> @Dakuu75 And it seems to be becoming more common
[4:05:04] <%serpenttucker> cheer200 Paige go take pat to a drive-in, for real.
[4:05:04] <DuckfishPrime> I think I saw the Pokemon movie in a drive-in. Of course that could be wrong.

[4:05:15] <Grayhammatter> but is it big?
[4:05:15] <Zathas> @Dakuu75 Your video card is a bigger factor for those, but for more modern games, they might pick up some slack from a slightly out of date card.
[4:05:15] <+Dakuu75> I was born in the god damn late 80's, I watched the internet be BORN and evolve... I've NEVER seen a drive-in movie theater.
[4:05:15] <alcors_wisdom> cant wait for pat to get absolutely fucked
[4:05:17] <dekkitout> j = h

[4:20:43] <IshikawaKenji> oh billy's streaming
[4:20:46] <ScreamingMeat> CDPR strikes again
[4:20:46] <$Niney_Who> @AngriestPat GOG also fixed Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth. I really wish you'd seen the second half, or at least "The final boss"
[4:20:46] <TheEnablerr> The GOG version is GREAT
[4:20:51] <%TombstoneTTromboners> fill us in on it pat
[4:20:51] <+DAREALGUMMY> Would you buy a remastered Switch version if made?
[4:20:53] <%PauliusMaximus> they have a better version of fallout 3 aswell
[4:20:53] <dukenux> foul,
[4:20:53] <%manwithboxonhead> 2 hours and 48 minutes before New Years for the west coast.
[4:20:55] <%OwlLightningMage> i've heard that GOG will take the time to fix certain games
[4:20:55] <%Typhaeon> You can probably just disable the overlay and fix most of those issues
[4:20:56] <alcors_wisdom> all you really need is the NV mod loader it will fix 90% of your problems
[4:20:58] <+ArcLifth> Huh, I never knew that
[4:20:59] <+CuttleCrow> really? damn, time to look for a sale
[4:20:59] <%sparrrow_> why would they be different though?
[4:20:59] <nolzee> @zafooru chur bro those things can ruin a playthrough if you quicksave wrong
[4:20:59] <%TombstoneTTromboners> interesting
[4:21:00] <zafooru> hey pat why did you take medicine if you dont use items
[4:21:00] <dukenux> foul wretched beasts
[4:21:02] <TheEnablerr> it comes 4gb aware right from the start
[4:21:04] <%jiin6> gog's version is also better to mod
[4:21:05] <Indeimaus> ok now this is epic
[4:21:05] <%thedemoninthestorm> That's actually not surprising, but I never considered it before now.
[4:21:06] <$Niney_Who> SourPls

[4:25:29] <+CuttleCrow> WAR CRIMES
[4:25:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Why has no one ever so much as cleared the hundred year old trash piles out of these places?

[4:25:38] <%rumuloh> Star cap by the body
[4:25:39] <Chaoko99> CARDS
[4:25:41] <alcors_wisdom> @ill_tempered_man same but ive played it so many times its basically just going through the motions at this point
[4:25:41] <$Niney_Who> But getting cards = XP NotLikeThis

[4:25:57] <zafooru> pat you are a brave lad and i have nothing but respect for you
[4:25:59] <disflipmat> Nice bench. For a clown. At the circus. Idiot.
[4:25:59] <Gruhunchously> @fruit_pie_the_magician That's a question I have with all the 3D Fallouts.
[4:26:02] <%strugglepunk2> remember guys crafting is different from building. You see, building is just taking things that you get and turning them into more useful stuff. This is basic warframe knowledge @AngriestPat
[4:26:05] <TheEnablerr> @AngriestPat you should get the Fallout 4 item menu mod. for this game. makes picking up items from storages WAY faster
[4:26:06] <%sparrrow_> Sleep to heal
[4:26:08] <+DAREALGUMMY> varmint shooting
[4:26:09] <%Malikial> @Gruhunchously Are you like Face McShooty in borderlands 2?
[4:26:11] <%lizard0tm> Let's just hink the fuck outta Pat whenever he misses items
[4:26:15] <%lizard0tm> *honk
[4:26:17] <$cerass> the cards... why... pat... you're killing me here... this is the oposite of asmr feelings

[4:26:27] <%strugglepunk2> ah fuck, bark scorpions.
[4:26:28] <+Wildfiretres> Happy New Year Pat!
[4:26:28] <%iwishthiswasicq> Pat you are a coward of a lad and I have absolutely no respect for you.
[4:26:29] <$Niney_Who> ???
[4:26:33] <ape_hawk> quickloot
[4:26:34] <gruib> hink
[4:26:35] <pistachio_the_nut> ???
[4:26:37] <%TheSpiritof2277> huh?
[4:26:39] <+Dakuu75> that ain't no ffxi Serket scorpion... where's the challenge, lol
[4:26:40] <%YabbaTroll> thats a good idea
[4:26:42] <Grayhammatter> what?
[4:26:45] <zafooru> he sleeps and then he heals
[4:26:46] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> oh quickloot
[4:26:46] <TheCamsan> I see Woolz is hosting. Happy New Year to your and yours!!
[4:26:46] <alrobot2014> quickloot
[4:26:47] <Darren716> That item system is the best part of 4
[4:26:48] <TheEnablerr> it's a new one. it lets you quick loot
[4:26:50] <+insertcleverusernameheree> Why cant we just get more new vegas
[4:26:50] <%Mike_Mc> is there a list of the mods Pat is currently using?
[4:26:51] <+mastertwin2> A mod that adds fallout 4's quickloot menus
[4:26:52] <$cerass> @thewinged7 all CAPS deletions
[4:26:53] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> you don't have to open the menu to loot
[4:26:56] <AirlineFood74> chat, they meant the UI for quicklooting
[4:26:56] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> Quickloot's not essential but I think the best part about the mod is somebody managed to make it work on New Vegas
[4:26:59] <%TombstoneTTromboners> the quick loot menu is very good
[4:26:59] <%riantDeliration> i was gone for like 2 hours how much quality did i miss
[4:26:59] <%jiin6> HAHAH
[4:27:04] <%sparrrow_> bark scorpions will mess you up man
[4:27:05] <Halospaz117> Down to hell it goes
[4:27:05] <Hellarussian> unlucky
[4:27:05] <%TheSpiritof2277> ah, quick loot would be useful
[4:27:05] <zafooru> through the planet he goes
[4:27:05] <%sparrrow_> irl
[4:27:09] <DocMadfox> Those fuckers always get stuck in the floor for me
[4:27:11] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> one of the best quality of life changes from 4
[4:27:11] <BallinArbiter> Spooky bark scorpion
[4:27:16] <DocMadfox> And it makes their corpses really weird
[4:27:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh hey Woolie, happy new year
[4:27:17] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> also one of the only good things in 4
[4:27:18] <alcors_wisdom> REMEMBER BREAKING LEGS MEANS THEY CANT RUN AT YOU ANYMORE prstrats
[4:27:18] <+insertcleverusernameheree> Fallout 76 could never touch the legendary status this game has
[4:27:21] <Kiraklene> Ground scorps...the meanest
[4:27:23] <$Niney_Who> I actually prefer the pause menu for looting
[4:27:24] <%thedemoninthestorm> Big bad scorpions
[4:27:26] <%strugglepunk2> Bark scorpions are the worst. You can't even antivenom their weird unique UI fucky poison.
[4:27:26] <Oxybe> floor scorp is watching you miss loot
[4:27:32] <+mastertwin2> They also managed to mod quickloot into Skyrim, too
[4:27:32] <Gruhunchously> @Malikial More like Arnold in Predator, really. But same idea.
[4:27:37] <chestnuts42> Any updates on the new podcast?
[4:27:40] <Grayhammatter> he's fucked
[4:27:41] <+Theophilus567> Hey pat. Have you ever heard of the new California mod? I’ve heard it’s a really big expansion and that it’s really good.

[4:27:49] <Kiraklene> Hug it pat LUL
[4:27:49] <%rumuloh> Pat can't see the loot on his PERFECTLY CALIBRATED tv

[4:27:57] <Valdorick> So, did he take antivenmon?
[4:27:58] <KeystoneA1> "I don't need antivenom"
[4:28:01] <Kiraklene> inb4 queen battle
[4:28:01] <alrobot2014> is this man named ted?
[4:28:03] <zafooru> they are crawling out of the floor for revenge
[4:28:04] <MrPedrovsky> @chestnuts42 it is done when it is ready
[4:28:08] <AirlineFood74> "I don't need the antivenom"
[4:28:10] <%rumuloh> "I never use antivenom"
[4:28:13] <Grayhammatter> doesn't need antivenom i see
[4:28:15] <SteveMcSmiles> Scorpion Yeee’d their last Haaaa
[4:28:17] <+ballsackmonster> inb4 RIP

[4:28:21] <anAngryHamster> Through the planet core
[4:28:23] <%JJCheeker> Well this does not bode well
[4:28:25] <%TombstoneTTromboners> Project Nevada and Solid Project also had a lotta good gameplay adjustments that are common in the modern era
[4:28:27] <$cerass> @northward12 yeyeyeyeyeye
[4:28:31] <%thedemoninthestorm> using a 357 in VATS is a bad idea
[4:28:31] <ScreamingMeat> "I don't need antivenom."
[4:28:33] <%JJCheeker> Never mind
[4:28:35] <+jon651> Happy New Years Everybody!
[4:28:38] <+DAREALGUMMY> wait, Pat skipped precious anti venom?
[4:28:38] <%TombstoneTTromboners> like a slowmo weapon wheel and a quick grenade button
[4:28:40] <+Dakuu75> why would they run away at the edge of their agro zone, monsters still do that? lol
[4:28:45] <+insertcleverusernameheree> Why didnt fallout stick this the structure
[4:28:47] <Oxybe> that cause scorps inject you with gravy, not poison
[4:28:50] <+reposted_darksouls_salt> Happy New Year Kappa

[4:33:03] <%ahegotrigger> yep exactly
[4:33:05] <+CuttleCrow> Ocelet would be ashamed of you

[4:33:59] <silvcrest> You lousy piece of shit, it wasn't even a sentence
[4:34:02] <%Reizie_Etherealm> What's the difference between increasing reload speed by 25% and decreasing reload time by 25%?
[4:34:04] <%homelesstwinky> Is CASM an autosave mod?

[4:34:22] <TheEnablerr> Lockpick is super useful. Science is a dump stat to me. Repair kicks it's ass and a lot of skill checks use both Repair and science so you can use one or the other,
[4:34:22] <%crimsonharvest> you will never run out of points with 9 int who cares if you put points in locks
[4:34:25] <TheCamsan> But finding useless stuff though??

[4:47:08] <+ogrest> @Dakuu75 good old games is a DRM free games distribution platform spearheaded by CD projekt red, it boasts a robust selection of newer and older pc titles with self contained installer packages that don't count as a license but count as a copy of the game
[4:47:10] <TheCamsan> Why PC always be so hard??

[4:47:31] <GyroBrando> U have to go to the upgrade screen and then put points in lockpicking thats how u do it
[4:47:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> (Gasp) I don't see it
[4:47:36] <+ogrest> @Dakuu75 this makes it better than steam, since steam by design is simply a series of contract licenses that can be revoked, while GOG lacks the capacity to revoke your game library even if they wanted to

[4:53:49] <alcors_wisdom> glad we could break fallout after he finished streaming it
[4:53:50] <CertainlySyrix> What's happening exactly? @AngriestPat
[4:53:51] <zerocruz> This gave me LUMBAGO
[4:53:51] <brunty1234> Describe the setting and we'll imagine the game
[4:53:52] <AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat that loot menu has a load order, I don't know if it's the default but it's worth looking over just in case 👍
[4:53:53] <Gruhunchously> @GarbageQueenEllie But there's nothing there, it's just blan...oh.

[4:53:58] <+ogrest> @AngriestPat this happens occasionally with the gamebryo engine and you have to restart to resolve, or use it like it's a desktop stream rather than window
[4:53:58] <TheEnablerr> always happened to me. New Vegas is Bipolar
[4:53:58] <+SWFanatic> sometimes you feel like a nut
[4:53:59] <%lizard0tm> @AngriestPat Do you want those super secret mods that replace enemies witht heir better looking FO4 counter parts? Got access to them since I'm part of GUNETWORK
[4:54:00] <+Anonymasque> I can see your 16 digit credit card number and the three digits on the back on screen weird.
[4:54:01] <%Nobrev> don't you love fallout troubleshooting pat?
[4:54:05] <Grayhammatter> nope, not a single thing
[4:54:06] <+ChiefWilly> I joined just now. It's New Vegas so it must've crashed right?

[4:54:15] <+ogrest> @AngriestPat I used to stream a lot of Falllout New Vegas and it's a hassle
[4:54:16] <martmartez> pat and dsp lets play channel soon
[4:54:19] <PsychoTech_ARMS> did you read mod description? Kappa
[4:54:23] <redwilt> Never

[4:54:25] <%MelBrooksKA> Race conditions sipsipGasm spyPraise
[4:54:25] <GyroBrando> And its DA inquisition all over again
[4:54:26] <CertainlySyrix> It's very easy to fuck a New Vegas installation while modding if you don't know what you're doing.
[4:54:28] <ScreamingMeat> Oh, FONV
[4:54:32] <+Dakuu75> so close, no matter how faaaaaaar~ couldn't be much more from the heart~ forever trusting who we are~
[4:54:34] <+CuttleCrow> consult your doctor before taking new vegas mods

[4:55:17] <%Badgerconda_> apatHoldon
[4:55:21] <Grandma_Amari> You can switch it to run as a borderless window in the .ini I think
[4:55:22] <+Anonymasque> You know what does work? Yakuza Kiwami lorDERP
[4:55:25] <+ogrest> @AngriestPat what software are you using for your setup? I use OBS
[4:55:26] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> IDK what you were expecting
[4:55:31] <+diazflak> Shoulda played 76 instead
[4:55:33] <laguerrilha> @AngriestPat there is a mod to run it in fake fullscreen mode
[4:55:33] <yautja_butts> Play Bloodlines instead
[4:55:35] <+Dakuu75> @AngriestPat Pat do you honest-to-god trust the majority chat here enough to follow their instructions when it comes to your PC... dude...
[4:55:35] <%TheDullaMAN> I expected nothing.
[4:55:37] <+ChiefWilly> It's usually archive invalidation in these cases

[4:56:34] <TheEnablerr> While you do that, thank you for reminding me to re-download CASM
[4:56:34] <%TheDullaMAN> Do a Bloodborne playthrough
[4:56:34] <+Dakuu75> wishes bloodborn was on pc
[4:56:37] <+CatYamHD> is the stream ending?
[4:56:37] <TranquilTurnip> @AngriestPat you could do Divinity Original Sin 2
[4:56:37] <+diazflak> Play Atlas with subs!!!
[4:56:39] <Gruhunchously> This is why you don't play God
[4:56:40] <+SWFanatic> it doesn't like you
[4:56:41] <+Theophilus567> Fallout used to demand I restart the game between streams
[4:56:42] <nina9669> thr futa mod will fix it
[4:56:43] <TalisKanju> Is Hollow Knight a good game to buy?
[4:56:45] <+ogrest> @AngriestPat from the support forums Not sure on this solution but it might be worth a shot. Open OBS and launch Fallout New Vegas. Set Fallout to Windowed Mode and go back to OBS. Then create a new Window Capture, select your the Fallout window and choose Inner Window. You might need to select a Sub-Region to get rid of the screen borders. I always stream games using Window Capture which works fine for me. Good luck.
[4:56:46] <JoseIbAr96> whens Demon's Souls you coward?
[4:56:46] <+Theophilus567> I mean sessions.
[4:56:47] <Grandma_Amari> Is Paige still planning on doing Dark Souls 2 in January?
[4:56:48] <tanarath> So, wait. Fallout NV requires three stooges syndrome to run or if you change stuff it doesn't run?
[4:56:49] <+ballsackmonster> can we blame Todd Howard?
[4:56:49] <%lizard0tm> Bloodborne will never be on PC
[4:56:50] <KeystoneA1> Time to play Vampire The Masquerade
[4:56:51] <%thedemoninthestorm> I was banned from chat for like 10 minutes and I can't figure out why
[4:56:56] <TheCamsan> Cause its how PC do.
[4:56:57] <mercado94> @TalisKanju YES
[4:56:58] <GyroBrando> Best ending in the game is breaking it midway through
[4:56:59] <+CuttleCrow> narrate what is happening for us
[4:57:01] <alcors_wisdom> do the texture mods run in fallout or outside fallout i.e. are there other .exe's running besides fallout when you launch
[4:57:07] <TalisKanju> I know Pat played Hollow Knight on stream and was considering getting it
[4:57:09] <MrPedrovsky> @angriestpat It is New Vegas you are unlucky
[4:57:10] <+CatYamHD> You can play BLoodbourne on PC through PS Now
[4:57:12] <yautja_butts> Pat, will you ever stream VtM:Bloodlines?

[5:02:59] <TheCamsan> Burglar, burgling!!!
[5:03:00] <+ogrest> @AngriestPat Not sure on this solution but it might be worth a shot. Open OBS and launch Fallout New Vegas. Set Fallout to Windowed Mode and go back to OBS. Then create a new Window Capture, select your the Fallout window and choose Inner Window. You might need to select a Sub-Region to get rid of the screen borders. I always stream games using Window Capture which works fine for me. Good luck.
