[0:37:15] <@StridentSong> Spike "One Fear" Spegal
[0:37:18] <+orochiblood> also that old woman who hits on Jet about his skin
[0:37:18] <%hewlettfan96> Spike spiegel is his real name wtf

[0:37:52] <cartakus> He is mad at the picture?
[0:37:54] <%hewlettfan96> The actors they got to cast them is stupid and have no charisma, Jet ‘black’ is literally played by a black guy now
[0:37:58] <deviljhojho_> Spike's full name is Fearless Pasternack in the live action show crikObject
[0:37:59] <Dr_Mooose> "I hunger father"
[0:38:00] <%barrakuta371> It's sad Halo is the only one that's kinda good
[0:38:04] <%Sotetsu> Too bad the new Cowboy Bebop isn't a musical.

[0:38:05] <Pookiedaexzile> How did they fumble the pack

[0:43:05] <+Draegen86> The robots were NOT subjugated! That's a lie!
[0:43:06] <LordOfThePoultry> yes :)
[0:43:08] <+ashunite> DAVID CAGE MADE THEM ROBOTS SO HE COULD FETISHIZE DARK SHORT HAIR GIRL AGAIN
[0:43:08] <%valriot> He probably thinks Malcom-X is the 10th version
[0:43:08] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> David Cage deserves to be in prison with the shit he pulls
[0:43:09] <+HebbieJebbies> Pat did a BIG LIE so he DESERVES a treat!

[0:43:26] <%hewlettfan96> Oh nooooe
[0:43:27] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> yet there are Cage simps who are willing to call anyone racist for criticising that tone deaf mess
[0:43:29] <cartakus> THE RACE WAR STARTS NOW
[0:43:32] <%MegadBlitz> I always thought knuckles had mesoamerican roots based on the echidna SA2 stuff
[0:43:33] <gorm_ringbreaker> david cage is the most basic spectacle-obsessed child in all media
[0:43:36] <+D00msDayDan> That’s called making assumptions, pat

[0:44:07] <@Ranryu692> Woolie would be hyped if he found out he was a robot, probably
[0:44:08] <%Pappajimbo> and the robots are all white underneath
[0:44:09] <Profmcstevie> I'd slightly understand the moral panic at black people in ye olden days if they were fucking Terminators
[0:44:10] <+ThomasOfTroy> What if Black people were robots and then the holocaust happened is Detroit's tl;dr
[0:44:11] <+ashunite> Tone deaf
[0:44:13] <SomeStrangeBroad> the babies will never be ok with your lies
[0:44:18] <devanmuse> What was the "One Good Scene" from Beyond Two Souls, and why is it the Secret Underwater Chinese Ghost Base?

[1:06:36] <$lotharrio> A small number of people disliked it and spoke loudly about it.
[1:06:36] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I think cake is the only food you can describe as moist.
[1:06:36] <+D00msDayDan> it's so delicious and moist
[1:06:36] <+lumporr> "mmm, this cake is... wet"

[1:06:47] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> There is no issue with it. It's an internet meme run amok that nobody wants to be "uncool" about not going with.

[1:07:03] <%hewlettfan96> @valriot Oh yeah or bussy
[1:07:03] <DarkRaigeFire> I mean I'm an American and I don't get it either, it's used in ads for baking and stuff all the time

[1:07:12] <TheHeroAppears> a bum bag is a better description of it I guess
[1:07:13] <+Gamblor69> We have a drink called Pussy
[1:07:13] <T_Sasquatch> Moist is a meme word . I get some words have an effect but moist is popularised

[1:07:31] <%SaiyanShoto> In UK kissing is called snog, shits weird over there
[1:07:31] <SomeStrangeBroad> that's the reason for not liking the word moist
[1:07:33] <+DatAsuna> the actual secret is that in the UK Nothing is consistent and all of those words mean multiple things for no good reason

[1:25:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> by being good at stealth

[1:25:19] <@Ranryu692> I thought Woolie was the Liar
[1:25:29] <%Djinnazz> It's not wrong to be wrong.
[1:25:31] <Sypheck> ^
[1:25:34] <+ashunite> He says it's true which means everything he's ever said is actually the truth
[1:25:35] <akitanito> how did that hit not register
[1:25:38] <ape_hawk> @Ranryu692 no, hes the pie stealer
[1:25:40] <$lotharrio> Crazy people can't lie. That's the dankest true lie ever lied.

[1:26:02] <%Aeoneth> I've had the Endwalker Trailer theme on repeat for the last 8 hours
[1:26:04] <cartakus> It's wrong to try to be right though
[1:26:04] <jorniev> ONLY TRUST HONEST LIARS, THIS IS A LIE
[1:26:04] <%Dakuu75> wait, can we talk about the trailers? or is that spoilers?

[1:26:19] <@TheYellowcouch> I'm only doing every side quest in the game cause I have nothing else I wanna do but I have a problem
[1:26:20] <KnivesEve> @PatStaresAt  even 1.0?
[1:26:23] <@Ranryu692> I keep hitting level cap while trying to beat Shadowbringers. Should I just give up on the xp and go forward with an 80, or should I keep leveling alt jobs?
[1:26:25] <%RealThiele> Gut gid

[1:26:39] <KnivesEve> nice

[1:27:22] <%Monkeyweed21> just do it on stream
[1:27:33] <TioXyco> You said you weren't going to stream EW MSQ, because you wanted to hang with your budies while doing it, but will you record and youtube it so we can watch your reactions to it? @PatStaresAt
[1:27:33] <%jackythefrost> @cartakus 1.0 was back when XIV was considered the worst MMO ever made
[1:27:45] <cartakus> oh
[1:27:48] <Visorak6> 1 night a week is rough unless your static is full of killers
[1:27:57] <%jackythefrost> theres a whole documentary about how XIV went from the worst MMO on the market to the best
[1:27:58] <+ashunite> How the turns have tabled
[1:27:59] <%captainpodock> what is savage?
[1:28:02] <cartakus> Well that's interesting
[1:28:09] <%amused_platypus> amused_platypus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 20 month streak! Thanks for all the good streams pat they really lift me up, in these tumultuous times.
[1:28:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah you gotta search the big containers
[1:28:22] <RyuuAoi> Pat, give us a hint about the #sponsored game. Give us the first letter in the name of the game.
[1:28:23] <TioXyco> OH!
[1:28:35] <+ashunite> Dope
[1:28:35] <TioXyco> fair enough
[1:28:43] <%THATGUY_789> but FF14 blew up
[1:28:43] <@TheYellowcouch> 24 hour streaming

[1:29:15] <@TheYellowcouch> general cool people

[1:30:31] <%captainpodock> holy shit
[1:30:32] <%amused_platypus> also glam farming takes a while
[1:30:32] <+ashunite> New Hildebrand let's goooooo
[1:30:37] <%captain_thickthighs> can you just pick a class from jump or you gotta branch into one?
[1:30:38] <%BinaryFireball> how many hours?
[1:30:39] <kulmoth> its the best recent ff game
[1:30:39] <@Ranryu692> it's technically like 5 games
[1:30:40] <%jackythefrost> Yes
[1:30:45] <joshujostar> was it 60-80 hrs per expansion msq?
[1:30:47] <%stoatacious> SPEAR FISHING LETS GOOOO
[1:30:47] <@TheYellowcouch> It's great
[1:30:55] <%sekri0> i thought i could blow through ARR in about a week and I was dead wrong
[1:30:56] <+ashunite> Fashion is the real endgame of 14
[1:30:58] <akitanito> glamour is endgame
[1:30:59] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> fancy clothes Pog
[1:31:04] <%amused_platypus> The truest of endgames
[1:31:06] <jorniev> EXEL DOCUMENT?
[1:31:09] <%DEETRz> the e12s tank coat is sexy as hell
[1:31:12] <%jackythefrost> The main story by itself is over 300 hours
[1:31:23] <joshujostar> damn
[1:31:23] <%valriot> LUL LUL
[1:31:24] <%RealThiele> @joshujostar id say like 20-40 hours for each expac msq depending on how you go at the content
[1:31:25] <%captainpodock> are you a fancy boy?
[1:31:28] <AFoolishPaper> paij
[1:31:28] <zerointelligence000> lmao... never stop playing
[1:31:30] <+ashunite> lol
[1:31:35] <%Monkeyweed21> FF14's biggest problem is that you have to play through 5 or 6 full length JRPGs in a row before you hit the "endgame"
[1:31:36] <%RealThiele> kugane LUL
[1:31:38] <%ClericOfSparda> LUL LUL LUL
[1:31:39] <+skellyjellytins> well damn
[1:31:40] <Visorak6> 54 mil nice
[1:31:41] <+ashunite> My gf does this too
[1:31:43] <cartakus> And I though MH W/ICEBORNE were a big part of my life
[1:31:46] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I stepped away, what was that screenshot?
[1:31:48] <%BinaryFireball> wait I thought those were the dudes who do the market shit for you
[1:31:48] <@TheYellowcouch> That explains a lot
[1:31:51] <%chance_h> Gotta get those leather
[1:31:59] <+Them00n> Are retainers like Pawns from Dragons Dogma?
[1:32:08] <RyuuAoi> Show is your man, Pat!
[1:32:09] <%ClericOfSparda> Wow 5 retainers?! I stay at one
[1:32:09] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:32:10] <RyuuAoi> Us
[1:32:14] <+skellyjellytins> got to buy all that leather
[1:32:17] <%captainpodock> FOR SHAME PAIGE
[1:32:20] <%cade_calrayn> and unlike the real ones, they actually listen to Pat
[1:32:22] <%ClericOfSparda> Sorry I meant 3
[1:32:23] <@Ranryu692> @captain_thickthighs you pick a class when you create your character, but the expansion classes are only selectable after reaching certain levels (but reaching that level and the npc is the only unlock requirement)
[1:32:28] <%jackythefrost> @Monkeyweed21 Thats only really an issue for people coming from WoW, most normal people can enjoy a story lol
[1:32:28] <@Ranryu692> you can have more than 2 retainers?
[1:32:29] <TioXyco> you an keep 2retainers for free, yeah
[1:32:36] <%G_Thunders> @monkeyweed21 doesn’t really feel like a problem, speaking as someone who did that from June until now. All the old content feels relevant
[1:32:50] <TioXyco> you can, you gotta pay extra 2 bucks for each retainer, up to a max of 8 extra (10 total)
[1:32:55] <%ClericOfSparda> @Ranryu692 Yeah but it costs extra to have more than 2
[1:32:58] <%Felhad> @ranryu692 for an extra monthly fee
[1:33:07] <@Ranryu692> ah, that makes sense
[1:33:12] <joshujostar> sounds like david hayter
[1:33:16] <%AyotoCorp> You might want to double-check that one crate with the two guys in front of it, if he doesn't say a line it means they were blocking it from opening properly
[1:33:16] <zerointelligence000> I missed a bit but did pat say he would be streaming his entire time with ew or just main story?
[1:33:34] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @PatStaresAt what happens when you do the konami code?
[1:33:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Godk, I hate those dudes
[1:33:40] <%tanarath> $30 MILLION DOLLARS!? V
[1:33:43] <Dunmarkh> SAVE
[1:33:47] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> nice
[1:33:49] <%AncelDeLambert> what on earth is going on, is Pat farming?
[1:33:55] <%NopeBadguy> these drive bys are really funny
[1:34:00] <%Bluwizard21> It's Potty time!
[1:34:03] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> so much shmone
[1:34:25] <+ashunite> You can never shit your pants if you carry potties with you
[1:34:31] <akitanito> I keep thinking that green heal aura is fox being stinky
[1:34:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> your passion is noted.
[1:34:42] <@TheYellowcouch> I hope so too! it's what got me into the games to begin with
[1:34:42] <%Alzero83> Its a great game but a game you have to dedicate time to
[1:34:43] <%cvp5127> when does it get good?
[1:34:48] <%SveriSageAdvice> dont worry, im going to be here for sure
[1:34:49] <TheTakkster> My cat is chasing the player sprite on screen
[1:34:51] <@TheYellowcouch> seeing that titania fight blew my mind
[1:34:52] <%valriot> I have 10 days off, I will be zooming
[1:34:52] <Visorak6> I'm running praetorium right now
[1:34:53] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I will probably absentmindedly listen to them like I do most of your stuff
[1:34:53] <%cade_calrayn> I plan on watching them when I actually reach that point in the story
[1:34:53] <cartakus> I wanna see new robot job or some shit
[1:34:54] <%NopeBadguy> I hope you know even if I can't be there live,I will for sure catch the vods
[1:34:56] <%kujofire990> I Blame you for getting me into to 14 and getting roped into savage raiding with mothman
[1:34:56] <%captainpodock> is there any chance of me getting on an ff14 server before endwalker? i would like to start.
[1:34:56] <+luck_draw> luck_draw subscribed with Prime. 
[1:34:57] <%Sotetsu> The plot spoilers usually make me skip the streams, but I still love hearing you talk about it
[1:34:57] <%Felhad> I plan to check in on the streams as long as im keeping ahead of it storywise
[1:34:57] <%Monkeyweed21> @jackythefrost the issue is less about the people that want to rush to the end like WoWheads but more the One Piece problem where you have to go through A LOT of story
[1:34:59] <Dr_Mooose> welp
[1:34:59] <Chaos_Aether> or not
[1:35:03] <%AncelDeLambert> 50 mil is more money than is possible to carry by hand
[1:35:04] <$lotharrio> Shoot that man.
[1:35:05] <lehvak182> LUL LUL LUL
[1:35:05] <zerointelligence000> your reactions to shadowbringers was part of the reason I started playing
[1:35:05] <jorniev> LUL
[1:35:05] <SaltyAzteca> God hath blighted Fox
[1:35:07] <AllenDeadman> Zeus says no
[1:35:09] <jcflyguy> I want to get back into 14 bad, but time is a bitch
[1:35:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, you got me to start playing XIV, bud. The streams are really good.
[1:35:10] <%captain_thickthighs> I was them sometimes to try to figure hot how people have fun with that style of gameplay
[1:35:14] <rottingskeleton> Hello Patrick
[1:35:15] <%chance_h> Lol
[1:35:17] <%tanarath> LUL
[1:35:18] <Chaos_Aether> Kill him
[1:35:20] <akitanito> just beat him up
[1:35:34] <%tanarath> PUNCH
[1:35:34] <%AncelDeLambert> 50 mil is absolutely worth killing someone over
[1:35:47] <$lotharrio> Treating you like some sort of jerk.
[1:35:49] <%tanarath> PAT, BEAT HIM FOR $50 million
[1:35:51] <Visorak6> have you tried throwing grenades at the boat?
[1:36:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah you should open up EVERY container
[1:36:04] <%AncelDeLambert> "how about we compromise. You give back half the money and I don't blow your kneecaps off"
[1:36:06] <%Bluwizard21> Mo problems
[1:36:12] <+triage0> money money for them hunnies
[1:36:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you know, just to be sure
[1:36:15] <%castlerock42> Pat, don't question getting 10 million.
[1:36:20] <%NopeBadguy> this game forces you to non lethal
[1:36:25] <ape_hawk> boats arent people, pat
[1:36:28] <%jackythefrost> @captain_thickthighs Its very difficult to watch and understand why. Hotkey based combat is something you have to feel for urself, and XIV in particular is actually quite weird compared to other hotkey based games
[1:36:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> don't waste your ammo on those dudes tho.
[1:36:29] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> LUL
[1:36:39] <cartakus> Is this the end of the game?
[1:36:43] <Visorak6> LUL
[1:36:45] <%notsoy> grenades were a great idea, chat Kappa

[1:36:56] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt By the way, those empty potties are reusable as save points
[1:36:58] <AllenDeadman> well that went as badly as it could have possibly gone

[1:37:51] <%Bluwizard21> I've been seeing that with from soft die hards and elden ring, they just circle back to the beta more and more

[1:38:10] <Dr_Mooose> monkaS
[1:38:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I hated it.
[1:38:15] <bakkatohri> What's the deal with old drivers being better than new drivers sometimes? I'd simply just make drivers that were better all the time.
[1:38:15] <HeroToxiko> windows 11 gang

[1:39:57] <%amused_platypus> paige and pat playing videogames together... unheard of
[1:39:59] <%Sotetsu> Anything you and Paige do together is a joy.
[1:40:00] <@TheYellowcouch> YEAH
[1:40:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pat I'd watch you and Paige watching paint dry

[1:40:01] <%chiazam> Yeah sure
[1:40:01] <%TheBensonator_> Anything to get more Paige on stream, deadass
[1:40:04] <@TheYellowcouch> REACH IS FOR REAL
[1:40:04] <%Djinnazz> yup
[1:40:05] <%doomunderthestairs> yassss Pat page plague coop
[1:40:06] <%valriot> Yes LUL
[1:40:06] <cartakus> PAIGE HAS TO DRIVE
[1:40:07] <+polothegreatest> Yes, also when Elites armor, Wort wort wort
[1:40:08] <NateyBeak> reach is brutal
[1:40:09] <%UvBenServed> Lol yup
[1:40:10] <AFoolishPaper> yea they do that
[1:40:10] <%VioletHeart> The first level of Reach is pretty rough on higher difficulties.
[1:40:12] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Oh, Reach is brutal
[1:40:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Yeah I had similar issues with Reach
[1:40:12] <%chance_h> You and Paige are always hilarious to watch
[1:40:13] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Yeah they can do that
[1:40:14] <Visorak6> Yeah jackals are bastards
[1:40:16] <%Treuan> The pain of growing old
[1:40:17] <Coystick> Reach is the Dark Souls of Halo games
[1:40:18] <Jmann1892> Reach is mean
[1:40:19] <%JackalopeHerd> That Jackal level is dirty
[1:40:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You are not alone there.
[1:40:22] <%Bluwizard21> Heroic and legendary are nuts with the gold and silver elites and the instashot jackals
[1:40:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> Heroic is the intended experience, and it's kinda hard
[1:40:27] <%barrakuta371> For Paige you may want to play on normal
[1:40:31] <@TheYellowcouch> No Reach is just real tough
[1:40:31] <%tanarath> Difficulty varies wildly
[1:40:34] <+polothegreatest> jackals is normal
[1:40:34] <@TheYellowcouch> it's for real real
[1:40:35] <TallYoda08> True I'm playing it right now
[1:40:36] <bakkatohri> Nyanners quote: "Why don't you play Halo Reach Around with your xbros."
[1:40:38] <+Nahual_Amini> That one is hard
[1:40:38] <%doomunderthestairs> yep
[1:40:38] <%Bt_Robot> Jackals are pure RNG, sometimes they just decide to kill you
[1:40:39] <TheHeroAppears> I just got 3 back melee's in halo in one match
[1:40:41] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I did Reach on legendary. It was not fun, I'll be honest.
[1:40:42] <jorniev> THE GAME CHEATS ON LEGENDARY
[1:40:43] <%JGardner03> Heads were popped you could say
[1:40:46] <+ashunite> Yeah jackals are a fuckign nuiscance with the splinter rifles
[1:40:48] <%ClericOfSparda> I enjoy watching group stuff, but I get how much of a pain it is to plan that stuff out.
[1:40:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YOU WHAT?
[1:40:56] <%Bt_Robot> Same thing happens in speedruns
[1:40:56] <akitanito> pfft
[1:40:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> YYYUP
[1:41:00] <@TheYellowcouch> It's not the worst one to play on legendary but it's definitely up there
[1:41:01] <jorniev> USE THE BIDET
[1:41:03] <%tanarath> Ports have legit different tuning and it can suck.
[1:41:03] <%JGardner03> Deadass tracking missles nice
[1:41:03] <%Ne1son> Do it they are hella fun
[1:41:05] <%Bluwizard21> Grenade the boxes for more movement
[1:41:06] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> molotov the nuc boat
[1:41:09] <+the_drummaestro> this looks hard
[1:41:11] <%Supermonaman> God damn.
[1:41:16] <+polothegreatest> the noob guide to halo legendary, always have plasma gun
[1:41:19] <bakkatohri> @jorniev Cheating AI is the worst. I hated the cheating AI in advance wars. I hate the cheating AI in Civilization games.
[1:41:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> It tracks you, and the burns it leaves on the ground damage you until they EVENTUALLY fade away
[1:41:23] <@TheYellowcouch> I think halo 4 was the worst legendary run for me cause enemies just one shot you
[1:41:27] <%Bluwizard21> oh then it wont be as funny with paige
[1:41:29] <+Javaa01> Yeah Halo 2 will put that difficulty in perspective, cause that game gives negative shits about you having a good time at high difficulties
[1:41:30] <%thotbane> Heroic is normal. the game is balanced around heroic.
[1:41:31] <%jackythefrost> Does it suck or does YOU suck
[1:41:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you want to get to clearing the area of boxes ASAP
[1:41:32] <%JGardner03> Regular, optimal paige level
[1:41:36] <cartakus> One hit?
[1:41:39] <jorniev> USE THE BIDET
[1:41:39] <%NopeBadguy> @patstaresat did we ever find out what happened with the noose
[1:41:42] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> its tracking only when it goes down?
[1:41:44] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> strange
[1:41:44] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt clear boxes for more wiggle room
[1:41:48] <%Eilocke> this boss is not easy
[1:41:49] <%castlerock42> Whelp, guess we're in it for the long haul.
[1:41:52] <zerointelligence000> lmao
[1:41:52] <$Futurecity10> what noose
[1:41:56] <+Ataraxis9> lol
[1:41:58] <%chiazam> Pat try calling your friends for advice
[1:42:01] <akitanito> all the grenades lol
[1:42:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Halo 3 has the worst Fps boss I've played
[1:42:09] <+ashunite> lel
[1:42:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> missiles only hit that large protrusion on the sub btw
[1:42:10] <jorniev> wait does MISSILES
[1:42:10] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[1:42:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> EVENTUALLY
[1:42:15] <jorniev> NO
[1:42:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> They fade eventually.
[1:42:15] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Dodge the missles!
[1:42:16] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> NOPESR
[1:42:18] <+ashunite> F
[1:42:19] <%ClericOfSparda> This looks rough
[1:42:19] <%FunkyStreams> those damn soviets and their dumfire missles
[1:42:19] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> NOPERS
[1:42:22] <%NopeBadguy> they leave fire puddles @patstaresat
[1:42:23] <%thotbane> @Pookiedaexzile It had any FPS boss?
[1:42:24] <%AyotoCorp> They do after a while, but the damage isn't that high
[1:42:24] <RyuuAoi> You're making progress though!
[1:42:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> But the burns stick around for some time.
[1:42:27] <%Eilocke> they go away after a bit
[1:42:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Just don't walk on them
[1:42:37] <jorniev> DOES THE BIDET LET YOU START FROM THE ROOM BEFORE THE BOSS?
[1:42:43] <Aoworth> :
[1:42:50] <cartakus> This thing sucks ass
[1:42:51] <Pookiedaexzile> @thotbane Ball
[1:43:01] <@TheYellowcouch> omg this game is mean
[1:43:03] <%CoffeeKaiju> CoffeeKaiju subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 10 month streak! Hey Pat Hey Chat! What was your favorite Xbox Live Arcade game? I have to say Castle Crashers even after how long it took for that game to work online.
[1:43:05] <jorniev> use the bazooka
[1:43:07] <Dr_Mooose> wow that takes a while
[1:43:11] <Aoworth> LUL
[1:43:13] <RyuuAoi> Well fuck
[1:43:14] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> whiff
[1:43:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Missile can only hit that large protrusion
[1:43:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Pookiedaexzile Guilty Spark? That's the only boss-ish thing I can think of
[1:43:20] <%captainpodock> pat does one need a group to play ff14 with? or can it be enjoyed single player?
[1:43:23] <SaltyAzteca> Damn this sub means business
[1:43:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> hated this boss fight so fucking much
[1:43:26] <%stoatacious> castle crashers is great
[1:43:29] <akitanito> oh boy
[1:43:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and now we got disappearing terrain
[1:43:42] <akitanito> reminds me of that ys fight
[1:43:53] <grimm_hatter> actually missed the broad side if the bar
[1:43:54] <%stoatacious> @captainpodock most of the gme can be played single payer or with pick up groups
[1:44:01] <%GarbageNirvana> How many missiles does this dang sub have
[1:44:03] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> rip
[1:44:07] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> so close
[1:44:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Yes, guilty spark, I didn't want to spoil laserball for a Halo 3 run
[1:44:23] <+ThomasOfTroy> Are the silo hatches weak points?
[1:44:26] <%Puhff> git ownd
[1:44:29] <akitanito> unless if you're DPS
[1:44:32] <RyuuAoi> I bet the #sponsored stream is the GTA Trilogy
[1:44:33] <cartakus> Raids are group focused right?
[1:44:37] <%chance_h> This is just like Dark Souls
[1:44:37] <+ashunite> The queus will be quite long if you're a dps
[1:44:43] <@Ranryu692> wanna bet?
[1:44:47] <+skellyjellytins> yeah people pretty chill in FF14
[1:44:51] <%cvp5127> doubt
[1:44:53] <BlindGato> friends dont exist
[1:44:55] <+CapnClassix> Go healer, make ALL the friends
[1:45:10] <%ClericOfSparda> Extremes and Savage (the high end content) can be done in Pick Up Groups (PUGS) but honestly those can be a real trial
[1:45:12] <@Ranryu692> LUL I made it to 80 without making any new acquaintances!
[1:45:17] <cartakus> Go healer, make ALL the enemies
[1:45:19] <@Ranryu692> because I have horrible social anxiety LUL
[1:45:19] <%Puhff> being anti-scoial isn't a competition y'all
[1:45:24] <+Them00n> Making friends is easy if you aren't afraid, or so I'm told.
[1:45:36] <%Eilocke> i absolutely didn't know how to tank for my first dungeon, and my PUG was super understanding and helpful. a far cry from my experience with WoW
[1:45:44] <+skellyjellytins> heal
[1:46:13] <SpookyMooks> noooo
[1:46:13] <%JGardner03> Greedy
[1:46:13] <+ashunite> Oof
[1:46:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> boss sucks, right?
[1:46:15] <akitanito> close
[1:46:17] <+MisterAvry> hord
[1:46:18] <%FunkyStreams> Seems like you should stay to one side of the other, best you can to maximize the space you have to maneuver on.
[1:46:20] <%Saadi90> I love my FF14 family! Awesome people who have become lifelong friends over the years.
[1:46:21] <%Bluwizard21> this is a pretty tough boss
[1:46:21] <%AncelDeLambert> ya greedy, boi
[1:46:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> worst boss for me in the game.
[1:46:28] <+paladinstarbuster> so close
[1:46:32] <%AncelDeLambert> count how many you can throw that'll hit and NEVER go beyond that number
[1:46:33] <devanmuse> By the way, the medkits heal slowly over time. If you take ANY damage while it's going (like if you walk over the hot spots on the ground) it cancels the healing
[1:46:35] <+zephyboi> Drop your shield
[1:46:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> just gotta git gud Kappa
[1:46:40] <%spitelite> just don't get hit
[1:46:40] <%NopeBadguy> you are getting a bit greedy lmao
[1:46:47] <@Ranryu692> this boss fight is making me very anti-nuclear submarine
[1:46:49] <+mmack093> Why main character look like vinny vinesauce?
[1:46:53] <%BeingTheVictor> @TheYellowcouch Thanks for the gift sub!
[1:46:54] <%AncelDeLambert> six, you can throw six
[1:47:04] <bakkatohri> NGL I don't like games that emulate retro games... Like The Messenger? I just couldn't finish it. Why? I hate old ALL NES ERA games.
[1:47:20] <bakkatohri> SNES era is tolerable.
[1:47:29] <@TheYellowcouch> @BeingTheVictor enjoy the sub!
[1:47:48] <%KineticZen> LUL oh man
[1:47:50] <cartakus> I mean there is no winning in that case

[1:48:12] <%Bluwizard21> Boooooooweeeeeep
[1:48:13] <%JGardner03> That was pretty good
[1:48:14] <%Puhff> LMAO
[1:48:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> My best advice, clear EVERY box, and fire off missiles firsst. Once you run out, grenades.
[1:48:15] <@TheYellowcouch> This is big mean you
[1:48:17] <+mmack093> What was that noise lol
[1:48:18] <+MisterAvry> that looks frustrating

[1:53:06] <RyuuAoi> Pat saved us. Thanks Pat
[1:53:06] <%Djinnazz> Cux it ids
[1:53:07] <$Futurecity10> combats better
[1:53:08] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> for the memes
[1:53:10] <+SpiritRoads> Sequel better
[1:53:11] <%Djinnazz> cus it is*/
[1:53:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> More polish?
[1:53:14] <+zephyboi> It's ethically sourced
[1:53:14] <%StebTheVee> 2 has a devil trigger
[1:53:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> god, that sucks.
[1:53:16] <Dova573> Not the levers is just the combat is way better
[1:53:17] <%RealThiele> QoL changes
[1:53:17] <%RayReborne> new mechanics and weapon types
[1:53:18] <%espanishcanamurciana> Great question!
[1:53:20] <@TheYellowcouch> Cause there's 2 whole niohs now
[1:53:21] <%valriot> Its Persona 4 to Persona 5 mechanical changes
[1:53:22] <+SpiritRoads> its better in every way
[1:53:22] <Treasure_Vault> Sunk Cost fallacy?
[1:53:23] <jorniev> use the bidet
[1:53:25] <heartlesshealer> QoL
[1:53:25] <+Rofiarf> i like being a custom character
[1:53:25] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt The skills are easier to follow on the skill tree, the items actually do something, and you get a devil trigger
[1:53:26] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Literally everything about nioh 2 is better
[1:53:26] <%JGardner03> Ya'll played the Nioh's?
[1:53:26] <%Bt_Robot> It's the Lost fallacy
[1:53:27] <+uncyderf> difficulty curve is more even
[1:53:28] <cartakus> People learned stuff from one and in that way 2 is just better
[1:53:28] <+Smokebanshee> More content
[1:53:29] <+Nkbzodiac> cool new combat mechanics
[1:53:30] <MyNameIsRasus> This boss sucks
[1:53:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> less jank more polish
[1:53:35] <%Eilocke> better levels, enemy variety, skill tree, bosses, lots of stuff
[1:53:35] <%RayReborne> @valriot yeah nice
[1:53:37] <%Axellogic> Stat descriptions in nioh 2 arent as confusing
[1:53:39] <bakkatohri> I played Nioh 2 and then immediately played Nioh 1 on PSNow. I think it has to do with the fact that Nioh 1 feels kinda janky and that Nioh 2 has a great character creator.
[1:53:40] <%Bt_Robot> It solves some issues and raises twice as many
[1:53:44] <RyuuAoi> Name a video game sequel that's worse than the original?
[1:53:44] <%chiazam> ALL OF IT PAT all of it is better
[1:53:45] <Pookiedaexzile> Shark
[1:53:49] <%espanishcanamurciana> Hey @PatStaresAt have you seen the new Resident Evil film yet??  WElcome to Raccoon City?
[1:53:51] <burgerpantsed> bigger levels, new fancier weapons, devil trigger, questionably more interesting main character
[1:53:52] <%Axellogic> The skill trees make sense
[1:53:54] <%jackythefrost> @PatStaresAt Nioh 2s mechanics are much more complexx and adds a shit ton more variety
[1:53:55] <TheLunarVibes> In short, Nioh 2 is Nioh, but better
[1:53:59] <cartakus> I still don't know anything about levels though
[1:53:59] <jorniev> so the bidet lets him get a checkpoint right before the boss
[1:53:59] <%tanarath> MUCH less jank, MUCH better good stuff.
[1:54:01] <Dova573> I would say is like going from mh4u to mh world or rise
[1:54:14] <%Bluwizard21> @chiazam Well the looter shooter aspect still sucks, imo
[1:54:23] <%jackythefrost> They even add stealing Demon abilities
[1:54:24] <%RayReborne> Switchglaive is such a great Weapon class, and Fists are straight up busted if you get the DLC
[1:54:28] <%jackythefrost> its fucking awesome
[1:54:34] <TheLunarVibes> It's like playing Pokemon Platinum after Diamond or Pearl
[1:54:37] <cartakus> The double axes are the best
[1:54:50] <%jackythefrost> Spear for me
[1:54:52] <+Javaa01> The true secret strategy: It's just a game of Snake
[1:54:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah I hate the hitbox shit on this boss
[1:54:56] <TrollKing96> Heal and use a bidet just outside the boss room.
[1:54:57] <+Javaa01> Because har har
[1:54:59] <cartakus> Rip
[1:55:00] <Dova573> SCYTHE IS BEST
[1:55:00] <+Javaa01> Puns
[1:55:02] <jorniev> BIDET
[1:55:08] <jorniev> PORTA TOILET
[1:55:09] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> this will be the run plupGun
[1:55:10] <HeroToxiko> they made it more like ninja gaiden and people who hadn't played it never noticed
[1:55:10] <%RayReborne> oh Hatchets are dumb fun too
[1:55:11] <+Them00n> Is the stage destruction scripted?
[1:55:18] <ZComiX> Hitting the missile bays does more damage
[1:55:19] <%Bt_Robot> This appears to be both time and damage based
[1:55:19] <jorniev> dammit
[1:55:22] <ZComiX> When ilen
[1:55:24] <%valriot> Skill trees, scaling, weapon/magic/ninjitsu points come from use, Yokai abilities, best armour, you can adjust scaling strengths later on, and it has over twice the enemy variety
[1:55:26] <ZComiX> Open
[1:55:30] <burgerpantsed> the loot is honestly not that bad, because you just get whatever gives you more number until you're in like NG+ or NG++m that's when passives start to matter
[1:55:32] <%JGardner03> This reminds me of doing the Halo gun challenges and your first run being the best
[1:55:35] <%tanarath> @them00n seems to be speed-based
[1:55:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I know
[1:55:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it is weird as fuck
[1:55:42] <%jackythefrost> Nioh 2 is just Ninja Gaiden 2 isnt it
[1:55:42] <pokefan9956> OH NO. ORB MAN
[1:55:49] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> @patstaresat Are you gonna stream Nioh 2 when you get to it?
[1:55:49] <%NopeBadguy> @patstaresat don't you still have the god mode artifact
[1:56:00] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> THIS WILL BE THE RUN plupGun
[1:56:00] <%AyotoCorp> Did he forget about the dodge
[1:56:03] <jorniev> USE YOUR QUICK SAVE
[1:56:03] <+MisterAvry> oh shit I just realized the scorch marks on the ground hurt you
[1:56:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Boss fight goes quicker with missiles first. Just sayin.
[1:56:05] <heartlesshealer> glowing hot
[1:56:06] <SaltyAzteca> Those missiles are specifically meant for you it seems
[1:56:14] <+madspaniardbaker> Dont give up! PAT, stay DETERMINED!
[1:56:16] <yeildingthought> Nioh 2 patched all the fun stuff out itself though, on the higher difficulty’s you need something like 8 debuffs to get anywhere meaningful on a boss health bar. And the devil trigger changes your move set to a clunkier one with less versatility that any higher difficulty boss will just slap you out of LUL
[1:56:17] <%RayReborne> @jackythefrost funny you day that, a certain ninja can be a costume........
[1:56:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> that would be a waste of a quick save honestly
[1:56:22] <cartakus> lol
[1:56:22] <%RayReborne> *say
[1:56:26] <Dova573> Honestly Stranger of Edge paradise has me legit excited cuase is gonna be Final Fantasy Nioh
[1:56:29] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> mind goblins tell you no CHAT TELLS YOU YES
[1:56:32] <akitanito> You refresh the quicksave as long as you use the WC before you exit game
[1:56:33] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> If they made a sequel to this game, would it ReMetal or DisMetal?
[1:56:38] <%FunkyStreams> you never beat it...\
[1:56:41] <+mmack093> I've been there before
[1:56:42] <@TheYellowcouch> It's a rough boss
[1:56:51] <heartlesshealer> did you use the rockets before or was it just grenades?
[1:56:56] <%Eilocke> flashbacks to having to redo the final boss of La-Mulana after failing a timed escape sequence
[1:57:01] <Dova573> I already prefer killing ff monsters over nioh yokal
[1:57:02] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> dang he just ate that
[1:57:02] <akitanito> just heal for frequently I guess

[1:58:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> no more sub
[1:58:28] <cartakus> just that
[1:58:29] <+MisterAvry> good job
[1:58:30] <%Axellogic> Nioh might make me talk too much when you play it :V
[1:58:33] <%Mr_Pylon> yaaaaaay
[1:58:33] <%jackythefrost> From whats been said Endwalker may be as long as ARR
[1:58:35] <heartlesshealer> yay
[1:58:35] <%RayReborne> thats great lol
[1:58:37] <%StebTheVee> save
[1:58:42] <+mmack093> You just had to walk one screen up? LOL
[1:58:43] <Dunmarkh> huzzah
[1:58:47] <+MisterAvry> you diddit
[1:58:53] <Dova573> IS MR BLUE?!
[1:58:54] <%RayReborne> @axellogic dude that was ME at the nioh stream lol
[1:58:54] <+RowenCleric> whats the longest ff14 expansion quest wise?
[1:58:55] <@Ranryu692> Colonel Blue?
[1:59:07] <%ace_cfa44> tom clancy vs the ssgns ohio
[1:59:08] <ape_hawk> SO LIT, FAM
[1:59:13] <%tanarath> LIQUID
[1:59:15] <%jackythefrost> Stormblood
[1:59:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Oh...he DOES give Blue vibes from Dragonball, doesn't it? Didn't catch that before.
[1:59:17] <Dova573> Quick Call Goku
[1:59:17] <+mmack093> This dialogue seems bad
[1:59:19] <cartakus> I wanna know what's so important about the moon in EW
[1:59:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> *he
[1:59:44] <%AncelDeLambert> @cartakus 's haunted
[1:59:50] <%Axellogic> @RayReborne I actually really enjoy the helping people through nioh part
[1:59:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> 🔥 🔥 its lit 🔥 🔥
[1:59:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @mmack093 it's more reminiscent of classic Metal Gear than anything. Seems intentionally simple.
[2:00:03] <%chance_h> Stormblood is probably the largest, at least it introduced a lot of stuff at the time
[2:00:10] <SaltyAzteca> THERE WONT BE A HOME TO GO HOME TOO
[2:00:10] <%Axellogic> It makes me replay nioh more than anything, To me Nioh is a coop game
[2:00:11] <cartakus> Haunted? Just haunted?
[2:00:14] <%jackythefrost> We kinda already know why the moons important but you have to play the game to "get it"
[2:00:19] <ape_hawk> yeah, gasoline. for butt-chugging
[2:00:23] <%RayReborne> @axellogic me too but part of me gets a little "backseat gamer" like lol
[2:00:26] <heartlesshealer> jesse's not the greatest soldier who ever lived, it's fine
[2:00:28] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm so glad no-one in here said "how can it be a nuclear submarine if it's not armed with nukes?"
[2:00:35] <yeildingthought> @jackythefrost it felt that way on, way of the nioh or demon difficulty for me. I liked the elemental mode from nioh 1 Way more than the devil trigger of 2 since it added to your existing move set instead of replacing it
[2:00:35] <+skellyjellytins> you gonna light the general n fire like metal gear?
[2:00:44] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Is fortnite just one big ad space
[2:00:52] <%Axellogic> @RayReborne I try not to backseat but Nioh DOES overload you with information
[2:01:02] <%emperordread> Damage
[2:01:02] <jorniev> @AHomeschoolDropout YES
[2:01:02] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> action man NODDERS
[2:01:04] <+skellyjellytins> demo
[2:01:04] <%stoatacious> damage seems good for bosses
[2:01:04] <%StebTheVee> health
[2:01:05] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> yes
[2:01:05] <%NopeBadguy> always damage
[2:01:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> your choice
[2:01:06] <ape_hawk> damage, honestly
[2:01:06] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Action hero!
[2:01:07] <+MisterAvry> touch pick
[2:01:08] <%Axellogic> I like healing
[2:01:09] <%DEETRz> passive heal number 1
[2:01:13] <%RayReborne> @axellogic exactly,its a thin line of balance
[2:01:17] <jorniev> ACTION HERO
[2:01:19] <SaltyAzteca> That first one wouldve been useful a couple screens ago...
[2:01:19] <%AncelDeLambert> ending a fight faster is the best damage mitigation
[2:01:24] <%tanarath> hmmm
[2:01:26] <+MisterAvry> big number
[2:01:29] <%chance_h> If you do more damage you don’t die
[2:01:30] <%StoopKid241> Demolition man would've been real helpful for that boss lol
[2:01:33] <+RowenCleric> demolition man woulda been super useful 10 minutes ago
[2:01:33] <%MidnightBurst12> @ahomeschooldropout no. everything else is an ad for fortnite.
[2:01:37] <%tanarath> I really like these levelups
[2:01:57] <akitanito> oh noooo
[2:02:13] <+MisterAvry> shit yeah

[2:02:17] <wqorst> it's green
[2:02:18] <akitanito> infinite missiles?
[2:02:20] <%jackythefrost> @yeildingthought I used the demon mode and the elemental mode from 1 so infrequently I never really found that to be an issue. In 2 especially the build variety is so insane that there are mechanics you can straight up just ignore
[2:02:24] <cartakus> And another one
[2:02:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> there's your HindD boss fight
[2:02:42] <ape_hawk> OWNED

[2:02:57] <MidnightPacif1c> ah a toobin'-like
[2:03:06] <BlindGato> Cloroform the helicopter
[2:03:10] <devanmuse> I think I spent more time on this boss than on the submarine
[2:03:23] <%Bluwizard21> Isn't this the opening of Black Lagoon?
[2:03:25] <RyuuAoi> Shmup it up, Pat!
[2:03:40] <+MisterAvry> crash
[2:03:52] <%RayReborne> @axellogic remind me, what are the expeditions? is that just multiplayer?
[2:03:56] <SaltyAzteca> @Bluwizard21 Oh yeah it is LUL
[2:04:02] <RyuuAoi> Must be getting close to the end.
[2:04:11] <+Brizzo24> no speedrun strats

[2:04:40] <%ace_cfa44> pirate yarrs at
[2:04:42] <%Axellogic> @RayReborne Expeditions are the lobby simultaneous multplayer, Random encounters is the dark souls style summon from shrine one
[2:04:48] <%jackythefrost> Aim better
[2:04:52] <Treasure_Vault> this is making me seasick
[2:04:58] <+MisterAvry> nice

[2:06:16] <%Axellogic> @RayReborne expeditions like add more enemies and double enemy health and enemies do more damage to account for up to 3 players
[2:06:29] <+mmack093> Is that Roshi?
[2:06:36] <+FattimusSlime> “I can disable the guards by sticking these bamboo reeds under their fingernails!”
[2:06:39] <cartakus> Maybe play some nioh if this ends too fast. Just to rest

[2:07:45] <%Axellogic> @ape_hawk it hovers so it much not be as bad I guess
[2:08:24] <devanmuse> I see the Illuminati pyramid is the godmode item, but what does the Dragon do?
[2:08:25] <%RayReborne> try combine maybe?
[2:08:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> how do you think?
[2:08:32] <+skellyjellytins> @Zaphire_Saucypants surveillance Camera?!!??

[2:08:46] <wqorst> wtf
[2:08:47] <%Axellogic> @RayReborne Random encounters doesnt scale the enemies up if you did that, but it does try to kinda scale you down a bit it mostly just lowers your health when you get summoned
[2:08:49] <cartakus> wow

[2:13:38] <%Axellogic> @RayReborne NG+ stuff in nioh is really fun cause brand new set bonuses and other stats start dropping so it gets really fun the deeper you go in. You can do some crazy builds with endgame sets.

[2:15:23] <%CoffeeKaiju> Safety Dance music video is my favorite Lord of Rings movie

[2:16:23] <%Eilocke> Didn't you say that the alarm never sounded? You're contradicting yourself! If you have kids, I just worry you'd teach them wrong things on an everyday basis!
[2:16:34] <+TungstenViper> ????
[2:16:37] <+FattimusSlime> You lack patience but it’s fine, nobody expected you to get anything on the first or second or third or fourth or fifth try.
[2:16:41] <+TungstenViper> that's bs
[2:16:42] <RyuuAoi> Game wants you to SLOOOOOW down

[2:32:35] <%FunkyStreams> Pat vs Camera is an ironic situation.
[2:32:47] <devanmuse> I'm going to save you a lot of frustration: there are items in both corners of this room. GET THEM BEFORE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR. AND EXAMINE THEM.
[2:32:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> There's a bunch of stuff for this next bit....you'll likely fail a lot
[2:33:02] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> so short
[2:33:10] <cartakus> Pat gets stared at
[2:33:17] <%RayReborne> wahoo pizza

[2:39:13] <Dunmarkh> gun

[2:39:15] <%AyotoCorp> Destroy those boxes up top
[2:39:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> shoot robot?
[2:39:21] <pricklypissant> Back to hinga dinga durgen.
[2:39:27] <devanmuse> The Exterminators you can kill. The Scandinavians are hard mode stealth
[2:39:55] <%Dakuu75> But guys, how'd he get the noose?
[2:40:12] <cartakus> That's a funny player choice of difficulty
[2:40:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> admittedly, I am sort of a stealth game enthusiast, so I am biased towards the stealthier option.
[2:40:19] <%RayReborne> @dakuu75 Tell ya later
[2:40:34] <%tanarath> he snore
[2:40:38] <+skellyjellytins> yes it's cute
[2:40:38] <Maleicus> no
[2:40:38] <cartakus> nah
[2:40:40] <%RayReborne> oh he big snore
[2:40:42] <%asgard147> I hear Fatty Boi sleeping limesAw psaDogchamp
[2:40:44] <%ace_cfa44> yis
[2:40:50] <%tanarath> psaBig snore
[2:40:52] <%FunkyStreams> he not no baby
[2:40:59] <%FunkyStreams> not no mo'
[2:41:16] <%Dakuu75> like NOTHING happened lol
[2:41:40] <%AyotoCorp> There's enough string for all of the guards
[2:42:00] <%RayReborne> hes gonna be awake lol
[2:42:22] <%Bluwizard21> this is so point and cliock adventure
[2:42:28] <%RayReborne> ah he let the other guy go too
[2:42:30] <%FunkyStreams> panik
[2:42:33] <cartakus> Hey look who fell asleep first!
[2:42:34] <%Logoth_> I feel asleep
[2:42:35] <%Dakuu75> XD
[2:42:40] <akitanito> oof
[2:42:42] <AngryAsian5> Oops. Fell asleep.
[2:42:45] <%RayReborne> tie ALL OF THEM
[2:43:00] <%RayReborne> off screen shenaw, im impressed tho
[2:43:05] <%AyotoCorp> There's enough string to tie every guard up, don't get goblin'd
[2:43:05] <%FunkyStreams> Oops. Pat failed the section.
[2:43:06] <%RayReborne> shenanigans
[2:43:12] <Dunmarkh> just murder the robots
[2:43:15] <@TheYellowcouch> Scandinavien är för mycket för dig
[2:43:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> what I liked to do is carry one of those guards over to the box and get teh rope, THEN tie him
[2:43:19] <cartakus> This is so dumb
[2:43:25] <Visorak6> You gave them to the guy
[2:43:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you used them to pay the dude
[2:43:26] <devanmuse> You gave the coins to the old man
[2:43:34] <%Eilocke> the game itself encourages stealth since you only get experience from unaware guards. Scandinavian guards are optimal
[2:43:36] <%Bt_Robot> You gave your coins to the old man
[2:43:55] <+FerdytheNerdy> "Light sleeper"
[2:43:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> there we go
[2:44:07] <akitanito> great idea
[2:44:13] <+skellyjellytins> opps
[2:44:30] <%FunkyStreams> should just say Oops in place of the game over screen.
[2:44:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> THERE we go
[2:44:57] <@TheYellowcouch> sådär ja

[2:46:55] <%JoshManVGH> Powder did MANY things wrong.
[2:46:59] <%captain_thickthighs> Powder sounds  like a crackheads name
[2:46:59] <%RealThiele> shoulda returned that orphan
[2:47:01] <%JoshManVGH> But so did Jayce
[2:47:06] <%AHomeschoolDropout> I actually gasped outloud when the big thing happened
[2:47:10] <TheFramedWarlock> Silco is based

[3:08:36] <@Ranryu692> I liked the conversation with the Doctors, but yeah this has been rougher
[3:08:37] <akitanito> one pip
[3:08:39] <+Fooguwu> what if you just did it good though
[3:08:46] <Visorak6> I honestly dont think this game needed to get a lot harder, its carried by its comedy not its difficulty
[3:08:58] <+TungstenViper> yeah, this feels like he went "man, how can i make this game more challenging?" but went overboard
[3:09:15] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> WaitHowDidIGetHere subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 3 month streak! At No Point Desist From Stealth

[3:10:11] <+TheLocalRival> Hey @patstaresat weird question but I’m teaching UMVC3 at my job and I was wondering if you had any tips of how to approach it? I’m excited but wondering how to tackle the situation since it’s such a dense game
[3:10:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, they're only on the first floor
[3:10:17] <%RayReborne> munnny
[3:10:22] <%castlerock42> I mean, he might still be Scandinavian.

[3:11:59] <%twistedj3ster> the punching concrete sound is very satisfying
[3:12:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> otherwise, yeah, it's important. Just...yeah.
[3:12:19] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> "Fuck your office!"
[3:12:32] <marcomatame> is this game just NotMetalGear? I mean it looks cool regardless but is it just that or is there more to it?

[3:16:32] <%NopeBadguy> @p3niletrauma killing is a fail state

[3:18:13] <%AyotoCorp> Don't forget you can punch a wall to attract enemies
[3:18:23] <MyNameIsRasus> Racist LUL

[3:19:13] <akitanito> he can see through corners!
[3:19:16] <%terrible35> so many
[3:19:20] <akitanito> this is hilarious
[3:19:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> hm...yeah I call bullshit on that one, didn't even call.
[3:19:24] <bakkatohri> Mike is a very traditional Japanese name.
[3:19:25] <%CappuccinoGuil> I left for a second and the guards are now Japanese bannermen???
[3:19:27] <Dunmarkh> LUL LUL
[3:19:29] <%terrible35> CLOWN CAR
[3:19:29] <dan_g_v> i just realized that they have a flag banner on their backs. Because japan

[3:19:42] <Dunmarkh> Jesus
[3:19:44] <akitanito> you got pretty far
[3:19:45] <%chance_h> He used to call me on their cell phone
[3:19:50] <%RayReborne> Unmetal warriors Kappa
[3:19:58] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[3:20:12] <akitanito> do it
[3:20:14] <%greasypete00> DO IT
[3:20:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> stealth fun, ye.
[3:20:19] <ape_hawk> cuz youre hitting man?
[3:20:23] <kulmoth> hitman is awesome
[3:20:27] <%Mr_Pylon> yeah Hitman!
[3:20:32] <%chiazam> wait why do they go down in one punch
[3:20:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah that's bullshit
[3:20:43] <TioXyco> they are just that efficient
[3:20:45] <jorniev> where was this game made?
[3:20:46] <akitanito> they are weaker but have peripheral vision
[3:20:47] <ape_hawk> @chiazam cuz theyre weaker
[3:20:49] <Dunmarkh> @chiazam because they're japanese
[3:20:53] <Maleicus> because they have bigger vision cones to offset it
[3:20:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> guess you'll just have to be extra vigilant.
[3:20:54] <%NopeBadguy> @chiazam because their vision cone is a wall
[3:21:20] <Maleicus> are they infinite i wonder
[3:21:25] <TrollKing96> Binoculars
[3:21:26] <ThatGuyThere03> what if you just did it good tho?????
[3:21:33] <%MelBrooksKA> Can he not hide against the wall when the alarm is called?
[3:22:14] <%FunkyStreams> do it, Pat!
[3:22:15] <Dunmarkh> @MelBrooksKA mind goblins are european extreme
[3:22:20] <%FunkyStreams> aw
[3:22:24] <MyNameIsRasus> oh yeah that's a salt pause
[3:22:52] <%chiazam> Pat did you have a hard time playing MGS 1?
[3:23:08] <%terrible35> Mike!
[3:23:16] <%doomunderthestairs> no troubles
[3:23:18] <%doomunderthestairs> not even a one
[3:23:36] <MyNameIsRasus> Vision cones should be visible always
[3:23:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> This is more reminiscent of the the MSX metal gear anyway.
[3:23:36] <KaiserMario> OG MG and MG2 you didn't have vision cones either
[3:23:44] <+vaderxyz1970> too impatient
[3:23:44] <%RayReborne> right the full sideways sightlines
[3:23:52] <+TungstenViper> and in the og MG1 and 2 the enemies could only see on a cross pattern
[3:23:56] <%RayReborne> these fuckers SUCK
[3:24:01] <AlmondRoll> @KaiserMario the vision cone there was a vision line
[3:24:06] <%chiazam> full sidways vision cone
[3:24:07] <AlmondRoll> and the line stops midway
[3:24:10] <jorniev> yeah og MG didnt age grasefully either
[3:24:20] <Visorak6> use the potties lots I guess
[3:24:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @jorniev true. Quite of a bit of that game's progression counts on the player having access to the original game manual.
[3:25:03] <KaiserMario> @AlmondRoll Pat is talking about the vision cone you see on soliton radar
[3:25:07] <%chiazam> Metal Gear is easier than Metal Gear Solid because in MG enemies had vision lines, not cones
[3:25:11] <+FattimusSlime> Sounds like Pat wants to switch over to I don’t know XENOGEARS or something maybe
[3:25:17] <%FunkyStreams> just take em all out
[3:25:19] <akitanito> too greed
[3:25:20] <%Bluwizard21> impatient
[3:25:31] <NovesNovele> The slingshot is useful here.
[3:25:33] <%terrible35> i just ate a muffin
[3:25:33] <+Them00n> That one was on you.
[3:25:33] <sauceboss310> sugoiAwawa sugoiAwawa sugoiAwawa
[3:25:36] <p3niletrauma> Pat is extremely patient
[3:25:38] <+TungstenViper> in the og MG1&2 you could exploit the diagonal blind spots and the box to stealth around
[3:25:42] <Dunmarkh> slingshot
[3:25:42] <+paladinstarbuster> gotta take it slow i guess
[3:25:46] <+ashunite> Can you not unleash the power of GUN
[3:25:49] <jorniev> this is the worst mix of lack of patience killing you and NOT FUN game desing
[3:25:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Frustration is the death of any stealth run.
[3:25:54] <%Bluwizard21> you got the first guy down just work the second guy when he comes around
[3:25:55] <ThatGuyThere03> I love how a dozen of them just come out of the woodwork
[3:25:58] <akitanito> oh yeah, do they also drop in one shot with slingshot?
[3:26:02] <@Ranryu692> no do it perfect tho
[3:26:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> but it's understandable.
[3:26:08] <Dunmarkh> Use the slingshot
[3:26:09] <+kewlmyc> Is this a time loop?
[3:26:18] <KingKZ> Has it been this brutal all stream?
[3:26:20] <%FunkyStreams> Hai!
[3:26:28] <%Bluwizard21> he has ranged attacks
[3:26:29] <%chiazam> Reset from Zero
[3:26:33] <%Bluwizard21> from like minute 10
[3:26:35] <jorniev> THAT WAS REALLY GOOD ADVICE
[3:26:36] <%Bluwizard21> i forgot
[3:26:38] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> pat back in the closest
[3:26:40] <p3niletrauma> d  i  f  f  i  c  u  l  t
[3:26:57] <%Bluwizard21> shoot them all pat
[3:26:59] <akitanito> that was bullshit
[3:27:00] <%RayReborne> full sideways pat
[3:27:02] <%chiazam> it really was that simple all along
[3:27:12] <%RayReborne> 180 degrees
[3:27:39] <KingKZ> This is wild
[3:27:46] <+poobus> realne25Nyc
[3:27:50] <%FunkyStreams> lol
[3:28:04] <akitanito> all 66 DU balls finally being useful
[3:28:08] <ape_hawk> wait, is pat on easy now?
[3:28:10] <+ashunite> Stress pissing because of the japanese
[3:28:13] <%twistedj3ster> it was going so well
[3:28:17] <%chiazam> the bathroom was right there lol
[3:28:27] <+TungstenViper> this is just straight old-school NES frustrating bs that makes you spend all night on a game just to never finish it because the rent time has run out
[3:28:33] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> 360 him
[3:28:37] <@Ranryu692> @ape_hawk no, these guys go down in one hit (because they're Japanese)
[3:28:47] <akitanito> uhhh
[3:28:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> wow
[3:28:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> that...is unfortunate
[3:28:59] <%SinnerEbru> that ones on the game
[3:29:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> definitely
[3:29:12] <%SinnerEbru> this one is you
[3:29:13] <lehvak182> Mans about ready to end this stream
[3:29:25] <cricket42069> I love stealth games
[3:29:25] <%RayReborne> yeah this seems super unfun, im starting to really see it now
[3:29:28] <+Them00n> Maybe take 5, drink some water?
[3:29:28] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Are ya winning son?
[3:29:35] <silkoh> It's not often I actually feel bad for Pat
[3:29:43] <lehvak182> You Can Do It Pat!
[3:29:44] <+TungstenViper> this is what usually happens on European Extreme LUL
[3:29:49] <%FunkyStreams> has anyone taken out all the guards that show up?
[3:29:55] <BobCarlosJunior> My man is seething right now LUL
[3:30:00] <bakkatohri> It's absolutely fine to not playing frustrating games, y'all - especially League of Legends.
[3:30:03] <MyNameIsRasus> if the alarm sounding is a reset anyway why not have the game just game over at that point? There's some really badly designed shit in here
[3:30:12] <lehvak182> it's time to absolutely cheeze it
[3:30:15] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I don't even remember old school Metal Gear being this unforgiving
[3:30:19] <%SinnerEbru> if you need a fiver, thats cool too
[3:30:27] <+megaman_sentinel> that was some b*******
[3:30:42] <@Ranryu692> wat
[3:30:44] <+ashunite> lol fucking how
[3:30:47] <%SinnerEbru> ?????
[3:30:49] <%AyotoCorp> You left the body in plain sight
[3:30:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I don't think that was waisthigh cover?
[3:30:51] <MyNameIsRasus> ????????
[3:30:54] <+ThomasOfTroy> It's waist high cover??
[3:30:54] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> That one is on the game
[3:30:54] <+TungstenViper> @CanadianAnimatorGuy it wasn't
[3:30:55] <lehvak182> the game is literally falling apart
[3:31:01] <MyNameIsRasus> FUCKING HOW?
[3:31:05] <akitanito> he saw you when you stood up
[3:31:06] <+ashunite> It wasn't no cos he shot you
[3:31:07] <%Bluwizard21> Let the bodies hit the floor
[3:31:25] <%twistedj3ster> I seen it

[3:52:37] <p3niletrauma> Those are the clamps you just made, dude
[3:52:38] <%Maids4lyfe> YES IT IS
[3:52:38] <+tetraes> Ignore the lines only look  at scissors @PatStaresAt
[3:52:38] <%SinnerEbru> IT IS THE CLAMP THO
[3:52:39] <%chiazam> thats the clamp
[3:52:39] <%FunkyStreams> thats just carried over from what youve already done
[3:52:39] <%Mr_Pylon> Those are the clamps you put on
[3:52:40] <Dr_Mooose> Pat no

[3:52:43] <%terrible35> NotLikeThis
[3:52:43] <+WeLucklessJacks> IT IS
[3:52:43] <+paladinstarbuster> the thick line is only on blue
[3:52:43] <Aeroallways> you need to look at the black rectangle with the white border next to the scissors pat
[3:52:44] <%doselfren> Cuz it's step 2
[3:52:44] <%Axellogic> oh no
[3:52:45] <+ashunite> ITS THE CLAMPS WHEN THEY'VE BEEN PUT THERE
[3:52:45] <%psidefx> Look it MATCHES 1 TO 1
[3:52:45] <aeonicVector> yes, when the clamps arent there they are dotted, and when they are....
[3:52:46] <%RayReborne> PAT ITS THE EXACT SAME SPOT AS THE CLAMP LINES
[3:52:46] <+ScrapKingKeita> yes, because those are from the previous diagram
[3:52:47] <ZComiX> No those are the alligator clipd
[3:52:47] <+ThomasOfTroy> It's the same line pat
[3:52:47] <Maleicus> this is a bit right
[3:52:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> it clamp
[3:52:47] <Daxalog> the brown line is the clamp
[3:52:49] <@Ranryu692> no, the clamps use the dotted lines in the first one. once they're on, they're the solid lines
[3:52:49] <%afronooch> oh no
[3:52:50] <devanmuse> They're in the same spot, Pat
[3:52:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You want to cut where the black solid line is. @PatStaresAt
[3:52:50] <+xcompleasedad> The little line NEXT TO THE SCISSORS
[3:52:50] <MechanizedGentleman> NotLikeThis
[3:52:50] <+Them00n> The little line represents what you cut
[3:52:50] <+ashunite> LOOK IT'S THE SAME POSITIONS
[3:52:51] <+TungstenViper> NO
[3:52:52] <%Arweynn> the clamps are black in the second image

[3:52:54] <+tegachannel> Pat your logic fails in that regard if you look at 5 and 6 on that diagram
[3:52:55] <Landedx> the clamps are solid in image 2
[3:52:55] <Daxalog> Your doing this on purpose
[3:52:56] <ape_hawk> JESUS CHRIST, PAT, THIS IS LIKE A LEVEL 2 DND PUZZLE
[3:52:56] <%FunkyStreams> because at that point it hadnt been done yet, pat.
[3:52:57] <%Maids4lyfe> IT'S THE WHITE BORDER LINE NOT THE LONG LINE
[3:52:57] <%chiazam> PAT
[3:52:57] <+AlucardX60> Pat look at the other cuts.
[3:52:57] <+monfo_the_great> Those are faded to show they're in the "background"
[3:52:57] <@Ranryu692> it isn't the clearest
[3:52:57] <%doomunderthestairs> on the next page they are solid lines
[3:52:59] <%tanarath> Small lines over wires
[3:52:59] <GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> yolo it
[3:53:00] <akitanito> look at the position of the clamp lines
[3:53:01] <+fattkennedy> YOU ONLY CUT BLUE
[3:53:02] <Enn19> Then why are the solid and dotted the same pat?
[3:53:03] <%terrible35> LUL
[3:53:03] <%Arweynn> blue red black

[3:53:05] <%MidnightBurst12> just blue
[3:53:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I agree.
[3:53:05] <%RayReborne> Its not LUL

[4:02:48] <aeonicVector> you were already at 1 N, so you miscounted
[4:02:48] <@Ranryu692> you did the first North, and then started counting at 1
[4:02:49] <Landedx> rip
[4:02:50] <%Djinnazz> get fucked
[4:02:52] <%tanarath> 2 + 3 = 5

[4:02:56] <p3niletrauma> Yes you did lol
[4:02:58] <devanmuse> Did you count the north you had already taken?
[4:03:02] <Landedx> didn't count your first north

[4:03:03] <%RayReborne> This is north 1 dude
[4:03:05] <%Bt_Robot> each SCREEN
[4:03:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it is the intersections. ONLY at the white squares
[4:03:07] <bakkatohri> It's perfectly fine to cheat against bullshit.
[4:03:09] <+Them00n> You counted the first 1 twice
[4:03:10] <%doselfren> When you re-checked the map and started counting, you already went north once
[4:03:12] <Gorgs7> 1 north
[4:03:14] <%doselfren> wasn't that one
