[1:19:17] <%Monkeyweed21> News from the Destiny Pits! Because of how sunsetting works, all the gear from Forsaken and Shadowkeep is basically unusable.

[1:25:28] <Archmortal> My PS4 controller has been pulling that shit while fucking wired, and I confirmed it isn't the cable

[1:26:04] <fIashman92> The notes don't correspond to the music. It's weird.
[1:26:04] <SeruraRenge> It's also physically impossible to beat Michael Jackson in that minigame, because he's the King of Pop

[1:26:29] <%gnarly_memes_bro> yeah just level freelancer and get it out of the way before it falls off
[1:26:33] <+Kurt_0> No it’s the best
[1:26:35] <tsnakesrule> PogChamp Suplex time?
[1:26:36] <%Kataguro> Bond 5
[1:26:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Because its not Necrodancer

[1:26:50] <%KineKithZen> Well, until a few chapters from now
[1:26:52] <Frogwash> Cock armor PogChamp
[1:26:52] <$lotharrio> Devil Rocker is solid. It's sort of like... multiple classes mashed together.
[1:26:52] <%sumrand0> if gene simmons can do it any old guy can!!!!
[1:26:52] <%weissguard> Vampirism is really good.
[1:26:54] <brachydios777> Woolie had no rythem confirmed
[1:26:55] <%Birdigalore> LOL Adachi hitting that mid life crisis
[1:26:57] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt the only weapons for Devil Rocker and Matriach are from the weapon substory
[1:26:58] <Ravingpyro> time to eat people
[1:26:58] <%Monkeyweed21> Eri is a top tier dealer @PatStaresAt
[1:27:02] <%honeyman18> it does have weapons at least
[1:27:04] <%HefestoForges> naginata?
[1:27:10] <ProfessorLuigi> Spikey football man
[1:27:11] <%psychicmaniac_> You need to max out the bond to become one
[1:27:11] <%AncelDeLambert> huh, so THAT'S the DLC
[1:27:12] <UlriktheSlayer1> YES
[1:27:16] <UlriktheSlayer1> it seems badass
[1:27:17] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @patstaresat the only way to get new devil rocker and matriarch weapons is at the end of the substory you were just doing
[1:27:20] <$lotharrio> The important thing is that Matriarch teaches you to shoot a gun forever.
[1:27:21] <%Monkeyweed21> Eri is an amazing dealer
[1:27:23] <%Piemen99> hot
[1:27:24] <%Kataguro> Enjoy your lack of weapons
[1:27:25] <TyrianPurpleHaze> She's good with that class
[1:27:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> of course uggly purple
[1:27:28] <@Pandora_Prime> WHY are all her jobs basically different flavors of hooker?
[1:27:29] <%Bailey__gaming> devil rocker and matriarch are amazing
[1:27:30] <cardamomo88> DEALER
[1:27:36] <%Blackleafx> LIL HAT
[1:27:36] <%sumrand0> ARISE CHICKEN! CHICKEN ARISE!
[1:27:43] <lightninglord> Stick with Matriarch. It's overpowered as hell.
[1:27:44] <%KineKithZen> With the weapons the classes are really good
[1:27:48] <%Daniel_Is_I> Dealer is also REALLY strong
[1:27:51] <%Bailey__gaming> Matriarch had power of GUN
[1:27:51] <Blank9> dealer's my favorite class for eri
[1:27:53] <%televisedrevolting> ONO
[1:27:54] <seaechiowai> @pandora_prime why not
[1:27:57] <%Lion_kun> Matriarch and Dealer are busted.
[1:27:58] <%Broken_Sonex> @Pandora_Prime Because why not?
[1:27:58] <%toastybites> she also doesn't exist in the main plot
[1:28:01] <%SunnyVarietyPack> Saeko has WAY higher healing stat
[1:28:02] <+mechslayer71> Woolie just fucking blew it on the dancing mini game in zero. 3 times...
[1:28:03] <%Kataguro> Wow
[1:28:04] <ProfessorLuigi> Eri makes a much better idol than saeko
[1:28:05] <%gnarly_memes_bro> Devil Rocker is allright but matriarch is fucking busted
[1:28:08] <%honeyman18> Dealer has been nice
[1:28:08] <%Monkeyweed21> Dealer is best job for Eri @PatStaresAt
[1:28:13] <HedgehogGames1> @Pandora_Prime "What other job could a woman have?" - Japan probably.
[1:28:24] <h0wiewong> Nothing wrong with trying stuff out
[1:28:25] <$valgaldur> Oh, this really is an RPG
[1:28:27] <+tigerfang86> it's called CREATIVITY
[1:28:30] <%promessav2> pat does NOT need to min max
[1:28:31] <%linSP> adachi devil rocker is so bad omg
[1:28:33] <+abrupt_abe> Freelancer is terrible due to no weapon, broken class because of it
[1:28:33] <redrins> by the end of the game even if you dont use freelancer he'll still have the skills
[1:28:34] <%Kataguro> Not yet
[1:28:36] <%Jaromero435> Game isn't super hard, just use what you like
[1:28:37] <%KineKithZen> No, but you get one from a later substory
[1:28:39] <%Alazull> Besides do you really want Eri not throwing thumbtacks?
[1:28:40] <%promessav2> i don't think pat has died
[1:28:41] <tsnakesrule> Oh btw, Freelancer is gonna be fuckin awful to play with
[1:28:41] <%Blackleafx> im eagerly awaiting Devils Hotpot
[1:28:44] <%gnarly_memes_bro> you do not have the devil rocker item yet
[1:28:45] <featuringfen> where did he get all the yakuza training gear?
[1:28:45] <%Sausious> that's alot of yakuzie training gear
[1:28:51] <baavetti> Why the training gear?
[1:28:53] <SeruraRenge> the only bad job is musician because everything it does, another job can do better
[1:28:57] <skyentombment> MORE LIKE SUPERPOWER RING AMIRITE
[1:28:58] <%coreyyotto> really the best move is to spread out to all of them and get them to around level 10 to get a spread of skills and stat bonuses
[1:29:00] <%PhantomMiG> They all have Yakuza training gear
[1:29:01] <seaechiowai> pat minmaxes paige irl
[1:29:03] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Because Devil Rocker is a DLC job, you can only get the other weapon from Chau Ka Long. Same with Matriarch.
[1:29:13] <%SunnyVarietyPack> this side quest you just started sells you the better devil rocker and matriarch weapons
[1:29:17] <%Lion_kun> The wewpon dealer quest will unlock weapons for rocker and matriarch
[1:29:22] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt the quest you just got from Survive will let you buy the only other weapon available for Devil Rocker and Matriarch
[1:29:24] <+corrosivePaladin> any free xp is good xp

[1:29:55] <%Broken_Sonex> @weissguard DOES HE?!
[1:29:56] <SeruraRenge> I feel bad for Nanba because he really gets left behind in terms of scaling as the game goes on
[1:30:16] <%weissguard> @weissguard Yes
[1:30:17] <%gnarly_memes_bro> hey its not like the fucking game tells you, jesus

[1:30:38] <%Sausious> @SeruraRenge nanba is the cause of the carnage in the back half of the game, he can suck it]
[1:30:44] <%NopeBadguy> Yeah
[1:30:50] <%weissguard> And thus, the game has exploded with stuff to do.

[1:36:38] <%krispen_wa> Woolie just got his ass kicked on the dance floor
[1:36:44] <$lotharrio> Deceptive Call! NARC ON THEM!
[1:36:51] <%gnarly_memes_bro> ooohh freelancer is so fucking WEAK
[1:37:03] <%Jaromero435> need MP for ORBITAL LASER
[1:37:06] <%gnarly_memes_bro> it saddens me
[1:37:09] <%Blackleafx> Weakness indicators are in
[1:37:09] <%RealThiele> he wants to taste the fucking curb
[1:37:12] <%Kataguro> I'm glad they patched Weakness indicators back in
[1:37:14] <$lotharrio> DRINK HIS BLOOD
[1:37:16] <%gnarly_memes_bro> no freelancer is just weak
[1:37:35] <+TheBitingIrish> Doesn't Freelancer have a lot of stat increases?
[1:37:37] <tsnakesrule> Freelancer has no weapons
[1:37:41] <%Bailey__gaming> Chainsaw WOOOOAHW
[1:37:52] <%gnarly_memes_bro> it gets good stat boosts for attack but its still always the worst choice
[1:37:54] <tsnakesrule> Freelancer just has good skills
[1:37:59] <Hellarussian> papercut
[1:38:00] <%debugdrawray_> papercut
[1:38:00] <akitanito> paper cut
[1:38:01] <iosephe> paper cuts
[1:38:02] <%promessav2> paper cuts are dangeroys
[1:38:02] <%StaceMcGate> Freelancer is only good for stats, the job accessory for it is in the final chapter
[1:38:03] <%Blackleafx> Papercuts are no joke
[1:38:04] <h0wiewong> Yeah Vampirism
[1:38:04] <Ravingpyro> severe paper cuts
[1:38:05] <BigShay93> paper cuts are brutal
[1:38:05] <+dante_must_die_exe> LUL
[1:38:06] <%TheBensonator_> Death by papercut tho
[1:38:09] <%krispen_wa> THATS RAD
[1:38:10] <TyrianPurpleHaze> But it's worth ranking up at least to something like 8-10 with all the jobs just for the stat boosts and such.
[1:38:11] <%gnarly_memes_bro> level it for the permanent boost then abandon it forever
[1:38:11] <BooitsDock> killed him super dead
[1:38:14] <%McSoliace> But suplexes though....
[1:38:15] <HedgehogGames1> Freelancer doesn't have a weapon, so the attack lags behind.
[1:38:15] <%RealThiele> japan nose bleed awkward
[1:38:17] <$lotharrio> I cant believe Adachi ATE that man alive.
[1:38:18] <skyentombment> THATS SICK

[1:38:33] <%promessav2> hahaha, this team is fun
[1:38:35] <whimsicallifestyle> stomped his dick twice
[1:38:37] <tsnakesrule> No yeah Freelancer is worth the Suplex
[1:38:40] <%gnarly_memes_bro> Oh yeah I still leveled freelancer to 50 for the stat buffs but I was miserable doing it

[1:39:59] <devanmuse> @RAGING_1NF3RNO Mahjong Parlor? Oh, guess he's never going to get them
[1:39:59] <COMB711> endless desire and atlas are pretty good

[1:40:03] <ChungusQuest> oh man, that Nic Cage song from the Homestuck soundtrack...
[1:40:03] <SpaceQueenLiv> pepper mill is prob the most worth right now

[1:40:17] <+Gespens> I've never seen a streamer do Fortune Teller, for what its worth
[1:40:20] <%Alazull> Makes a lot of bosses miss with their bigger attacks if they get the accuracy down

[1:40:48] <fIashman92> Dealer is the best class IMO
[1:40:48] <+The1WhoKnoxx> those girls are kinda busted looking...
[1:40:49] <$lotharrio> Nanba can get Host and Fortunteller to cover all three magic elements.
[1:40:50] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @gespens its a shame because fulminating forecast makes the game a joke

[1:40:52] <%Maids4lyfe> how come Ichiban doesn't get a crazy costume?
[1:40:53] <kingmemelord97> nice girls finish last
[1:40:54] <%psychicmaniac_> @patstaresat Freelancer Essence actions are so funny since they just reused the heat actions from previous games. Ichiban even goes into Kiryu’s fight stance when he’s doing it

[1:51:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt so when we come back you'll have all the weapons eh?
[1:51:50] <%Sausious> so did ANYONE die in 3?
[1:51:52] <huskarl_zap> The Joon gi han?
[1:51:55] <eco419> SeemsGood
[1:51:56] <%Mantorok06> gotta buy something to finish it
[1:51:57] <%Lion_kun> FIRST KASHIWAGI AND NOW LAU
[1:51:59] <%solracc25> To the business dimension!
[1:51:59] <%ShogunNoonto> buy 1 thing
[1:52:00] <+SWindleFeD> Just beat on some old dudes and take their pensions from their corpses
[1:52:00] <Blank9> doesn't complete until you do
[1:52:00] <%MikeTD81> it is not compleated
[1:52:03] <%krispen_wa> Yakuza 3 was just a dream
[1:52:04] <%televisedrevolting> @lion_kun Kashiwagi crashed in a burning helicopter.
[1:52:04] <MasterTonberry23> @Wilabeen1997 fine by me
[1:52:05] <%Lion_kun> Rikiya died.
[1:52:06] <fIashman92> It wasn't completed. That one's weird and I don't know how to proc the cutscene
[1:52:06] <%Bailey__gaming> oh that's the one with the FEELS
[1:52:08] <bobbyratlair> fuck it bring nishiki back
[1:52:09] <%RealThiele> ok creep
[1:52:11] <%Garthunox> @Jekado i'll hold that L
[1:52:13] <%BoxNavy> sh dont tell him itll be funny
[1:52:16] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt Do you think the Yakuza devs regret 3 so much they're just undoing every major event from it?
[1:52:16] <bobbyratlair> Bring KAZANA back why not
[1:52:17] <VritraReiRei> @sunnyvarietypack can you explain? it's been almost 8 years since I played that game
[1:52:19] <Alabyctor> The wiki of Kau is funny
[1:52:23] <darkspines520> watch kazama come back next
[1:52:24] <Justaguy3> How would i get the money. OH HEY LOOK a multimillion company i own
[1:52:25] <redrins> you need confidence level 7
[1:52:25] <%Daniel_Is_I> You need to buy a thing
[1:52:26] <bobbyratlair> Death doesn’t have to mean anything
[1:52:27] <%QuipSan> buy
[1:52:28] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @patstaresat sidestory doesn't end until you buy something and talk to him again
[1:52:28] <%StaceMcGate> you have to buy a certain amount from him
[1:52:31] <%coreyyotto> you have to max your confidence stat
[1:52:32] <HedgehogGames1> I think this game is saying Yakuza 3 straight up didn't happen.
[1:52:35] <+rainlily1245> bruh I refuse to believe anyone in this series stays dead
[1:52:38] <Blank9> I think chau ka long's just related, not actually lau
[1:52:42] <%off_to_work_we_go> no of nishki comes bad I'm out. not really but...please no
[1:52:45] <Ravingpyro> i liked Rikiya, tho
[1:52:45] <%Jekado> @Garthunox its so hard to kill people in yakuza series!!! I don't think guns work well in japan
[1:52:46] <%PsyqualiaSE> When's Mine gonna show up?
[1:52:46] <%JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> 3 was REALLY goofy
[1:52:49] <%Lion_kun> Since we are retconning deaths, can we bring back Goda?
[1:52:50] <@SoFarFetched> @Blank9 no it's actually Lau
[1:52:52] <%yukin0tora> Bring Mine back
[1:52:53] <%murderof_crows> You have to buy stuff from him
[1:52:59] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> Have we done story stuff yet?
[1:53:00] <brachydios777> That bartender isn’t Kashiwagi though right?
[1:53:03] <dretheroboticdeer> But rikiya tho
[1:53:06] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> 3 was a black sheep but had a lot of heart
[1:53:07] <%krispen_wa> It turns out Yumi survived the explosion
[1:53:10] <%televisedrevolting> Kreygasm
[1:53:10] <%bread_assassin> If they somehow bring Rikiya back, I'mma riot.
[1:53:11] <hassanico2> Cyborg Ryuji Gouda from Dead Souls please
[1:53:11] <bobbyratlair> Bring Black Monday and his awful voice actor
[1:53:12] <%Sausious> hit the urban rangers first, they can go invincible for a turn
[1:53:15] <%off_to_work_we_go> Obviously he was shot in the head with a rubber bullet
[1:53:15] <%Piemen99> thigh crush
[1:53:20] <%Garthunox> GIMME BACK RIKIYA
[1:53:23] <bobbyratlair> Bring EVERYONE BACK BECAUSE NOTHING MATTERS
[1:53:26] <%FutaSnek> What a way to go.
[1:53:29] <akitanito> it's just trash removal
[1:53:30] <%Jaromero435> Breaker has so many cool moves
[1:53:33] <%PsyqualiaSE> That was Tanimura's move Eri did
[1:53:36] <h0wiewong> I can't believe he styled on my friend's corpse
[1:53:37] <%sumrand0> DEATH BY SNU SNU
[1:53:40] <%gnarly_memes_bro> The suplex is really good but thats about it
[1:53:40] <%SunnyVarietyPack> @VritraReiRei in yakuza 3 two major deaths occur, both of those characters are alive and well in this game. So nothing of any significance happens at all in yakuza 3 now, good because its the worst one
[1:53:41] <%Niney_Who> The only upside of it is that you can get a Suplex
[1:53:44] <%StebTheVee> Eri's attacks should be called "God I wish that were me."
[1:53:44] <%televisedrevolting> It's not great till the end.
[1:53:50] <didi223> it would be good if you could get weapons for it
[1:53:53] <+catman042285> so rumbas anyone
[1:53:54] <MasterTonberry23> bring back sean connery
[1:53:55] <+King_floppy> it does but suplex is actually so good
[1:53:55] <hassanico2> Isn't Freelancer the no job job?
[1:53:58] <%Lion_kun> Bartender is totally kashiwagi
[1:53:59] <%coreyyotto> You basically have to suffer through the ranks to get the suplex
[1:54:03] <brachydios777> @sunnyvarietypack Wait, which characters?
[1:54:03] <%FutaSnek> Eri as a dominatrix feels weird
[1:54:07] <%McSoliace> suplex is the only thing worth it apparently
[1:54:09] <%WhereIsWill> eri already doing crazy dmg
[1:54:10] <Blank9> 3 sending kaoru back to her home planet of America in the irst 10 minutes sucked ass
[1:54:13] <%coreyyotto> Plus, there are parts of the story where you're forced into freelancer
[1:54:16] <%Garthunox> @MasterTonberry23 There's so many women he never beat
[1:54:17] <%off_to_work_we_go> I like freelancer simply for wrestling moves
[1:54:19] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> Ichiban is not Kiryu. without a weapon hes only got baby fists
[1:54:26] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Mass-killer?
[1:54:26] <+SWindleFeD> Eri is super cute
[1:54:27] <%Blackleafx> nani
[1:54:28] <%gnarly_memes_bro> I just boosted it in the battle arena, took me an hour maybe
[1:54:28] <%Jaromero435> I would say skip freelancer until you can power level it
[1:54:30] <%Kataguro> M U R D E R
[1:54:31] <%BoxNavy> she LOVES rumors
[1:54:33] <%Blackleafx> oh shes got crazy eyes
[1:54:34] <jorniev> THIS GUY!
[1:54:35] <+rainlily1245> Is that Lana
[1:54:35] <+CourageTheCat> what is that VOICE
[1:54:36] <BooitsDock> WHY
[1:54:39] <%RealThiele> those dead eyes
[1:54:39] <%Blackleafx> I C O N I C
[1:54:41] <%honeyman18> It's a brainwash goodie
[1:54:41] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Does japan have a problem with masked killers?
[1:54:42] <BooitsDock> ARE YOU HYPED FOR THIS GUY
[1:54:43] <h0wiewong> "Oh cool, a serial killer"
[1:54:45] <MasterTonberry23> True crime fandoms Kappa

[1:54:49] <%medusasghost> this is very 2020 of them
[1:54:51] <HedgehogGames1> Why these voices?
[1:54:51] <+reallybigrocks> I wanna get masked killed
[1:54:51] <olaksi> why do women love murderers so much?
[1:54:52] <%Jaromero435> ICONIC ACTUAL MURDERER
[1:54:54] <$lotharrio> Ichiban is a little weak bitch. That's why he has to roll with a party to get shit done.
[1:54:54] <%krispen_wa> I TOTALY WANNA DIE!
[1:54:55] <+CourageTheCat> OH NO
[1:54:56] <jorniev> THIS GUY LOOKED GREAT
[1:54:57] <%murderof_crows> Jason!!!
[1:54:57] <%sumrand0> they wanna get "ravaged"
[1:54:58] <Blank9> yeah he's just trying to learn hyper swagger
[1:54:59] <%Dunmarkh> Is this the columbine fandom?
[1:54:59] <+CourageTheCat> ARE THEY HORNY FOR SERIAL KILLERS
[1:55:01] <BooitsDock> OOOH I HOPE HE KILLS ME SUPER HARD
[1:55:02] <+Chronobot> they wanna fuck that physco
[1:55:02] <%MikeTD81> you'll have to come back to this one at night

[1:55:20] <%SunnyVarietyPack> @brachydios777 is it even okay to spoil that game? I know i just said the major events were undone but I feel like i shouldnt say
[1:55:20] <wrydiculous> WE STAN FOR JACK THE RIPPER
[1:55:23] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @PatStaresAt You get an item to level up Freelancer faster later, so you should wait to level it up.
[1:55:26] <NitronStreams> 4REAL
[1:55:26] <+Gespens> Is time for Jay-san?

[1:56:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> damn you internet
[1:56:24] <%StebTheVee> Jason?
[1:56:26] <%gnarly_memes_bro> I PRAY FOR THOSE DELUSIONAL PEOPLE
[1:56:27] <@SoFarFetched> Remember there's women who thought Ted Bundy was attractive
[1:56:28] <%Blackleafx> ACTUALLY JASON
[1:56:29] <%Jaromero435> not suspicious at all
[1:56:30] <h0wiewong> Yeah that's weird
[1:56:32] <%shiplord13> Cosplayer
[1:56:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE THIS QUEST
[1:56:47] <seaechiowai> that sign says "hope" for context

[1:56:50] <%Blackleafx> ichiban go punch this axe murderer
[1:56:51] <UlriktheSlayer1> yeah like ted bundy or whatever got tons of love letters and shit
[1:56:51] <%krispen_wa> Must be a hard-on for everyone
[1:56:55] <MasterTonberry23> "I'd do something about this murderer, but i dont want to get murdered"
[1:56:56] <Brunty023> I LOVE THIS ONE
[1:56:59] <SomeAsianDood> Poundmate time PogChamp
[1:57:03] <%TubeMan642> Ichiban woolieVS jason
[1:57:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @aitch971 Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:57:05] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt Could just be a guy cosplaying as Jason from Firday the 13th
[1:57:19] <%off_to_work_we_go> ted bundy was attractive. its why it was so hard to believe he was a vicious sadist
[1:57:22] <%Jaromero435> a masked killer? "I'll Kill You!"
[1:57:24] <VritraReiRei> just got here, what chapter are we on now?
[1:57:26] <blue6sub6remnant6> Student film maybe?
[1:57:26] <h0wiewong> Gotta advance to nighttime
[1:57:26] <MasterTonberry23> This dudes the killer, calling it
[1:57:34] <%off_to_work_we_go> morally gray
[1:57:46] <kingmemelord97> Ah yes ask the hobo for help and not the cops
[1:57:51] <cardamomo88> only if he is HOT
[1:57:58] <%krispen_wa> BUY THE YAMATO
[1:58:01] <%krispen_wa> MK2
[1:58:01] <redrins> how much confidence does pat have? cause he needs some for this to complete
[1:58:05] <@SoFarFetched> like Adachi said earlier "hot people can't be evil" Kappa
[1:58:05] <%Jaromero435> Morally hot
[1:58:10] <Maleicus> ah yes the helpful not corrupt cops
[1:58:22] <%WhereIsWill> perv: not again!
[1:58:22] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> @kingmemelord97 Cops are allied with corruption. Homeless have no such alliances
[1:58:24] <%HefestoForges> "No, I'm just wearing cosplay! Don't believe me? I'll kill you!"
[1:58:26] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @patstaresat to clarify, I believe you need to buy a weapon specifically from him to complete it, but thats like most of his inventory
[1:58:31] <akitanito> lawful hot
[1:58:38] <brachydios777> Oh god I looked backed at the bartender, he has the scar in the same place and everything
[1:58:41] <@Pandora_Prime> I miss having cool Sex Powers
[1:58:45] <+SWindleFeD> Do those taxis only take you to other taxi points or do they also take to/near objectives, stores, etc?
[1:58:47] <%Alazull> Several I think.
[1:58:53] <%SunnyVarietyPack> the matriach and ddevil rocker weapons you can buy from him are the upgradable ones
[1:59:07] <%QuipSan> yep
[1:59:10] <seaechiowai> @pandora_prime well, what did you have?
[1:59:11] <%boomstickery> naginatas are cool

[1:59:20] <%Alazull> I think you have to spend a certain amount of money
[1:59:21] <Hellarussian> right
[1:59:21] <%MikeTD81> no
[1:59:23] <h0wiewong> Hmm
[1:59:26] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt its a certain amount, one guy was wrong

[1:59:34] <%Garthunox> Have confidence
[1:59:34] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> maybe not the dlc ones

[1:59:41] <kingmemelord97> I don’t get the matriarch thing why not just call it a domantrix
[1:59:42] <%gnarly_memes_bro> oh jeez there's a confidence requirement? I had no clue genuinely my bad on that one

[1:59:52] <+Fusrahdo> moon2D moon2D
[1:59:52] <andritt> have confidence
[1:59:52] <@SoFarFetched> sort of
[1:59:54] <Guardiansaiyan> no prob
[1:59:56] <fIashman92> Keep climbing the ladder
[1:59:56] <cardamomo88> what is true then
[1:59:57] <%sumrand0> NO CONFIDENCE
[1:59:57] <%Monkeyweed21> Matriarch is super legit on Saeko tho
[1:59:59] <%BoxNavy> never talk to us again
[2:00:01] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> you were going to buy it anyway
[2:00:02] <%MikeTD81> ok confidence then
[2:00:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Us too Kappa
[2:00:03] <LadyRarityV> :)
[2:00:03] <ProfessorLuigi> bruh
[2:00:04] <seaechiowai> woolieONEGUY
[2:00:05] <lagon137> Do some tests
[2:00:06] <$lotharrio> Well it's also a thing you probably want eventually anyway.
[2:00:07] <%goose_attack_almanac> I don't know what else I did, but I bought a hobo weapon from him and it let me finish the sub story a few seconds later
[2:00:07] <Blank9> no you don't need rank 7, you just earned confidence from an achievement and got to rank 7
[2:00:10] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> that vtuber "no Confidence"
[2:00:12] <%Blackleafx> Kreygasm
[2:00:12] <%PigGuy800> I'm detecting sass
[2:00:14] <%gnarly_memes_bro> It worked for me I'm Sorry Pat
[2:00:15] <%QuipSan> Kreygasm
[2:00:19] <MasterTonberry23> what what in the butt
[2:00:22] <wrydiculous> ded
[2:00:27] <%MikeTD81> Not our fault your confidence sucks
[2:00:29] <%Lion_kun> Matriarch is top tier
[2:00:31] <Blank9> buy the cheapest sword he has and that'll do
[2:00:33] <artsupplies> whip service is so funny
[2:00:36] <Archmortal> yeah, seize the means of production from those capitalists
[2:00:53] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> just go do some tests for confidence. right? or did you do them all
[2:00:58] <%HefestoForges> did the game use to tell that an enemy was weak to the attacks before?
[2:00:59] <%gnarly_memes_bro> at this point he'll go back and pop it whenever he does it's not a huge deal
[2:01:04] <ProfessorLuigi> capitalism is defeated
[2:01:14] <%Blackleafx> @HefestoForges was added like a few days ago
[2:01:18] <hassanico2> Anyone hate Adachi's "GET A LIIIIIIFE" quote
[2:01:19] <Maleicus> is pat trying to get german suplex
[2:01:19] <hassanico2> He says it so much
[2:01:20] <blue6sub6remnant6> Will Adachi the Breaker/breakdancer ever not be impossibly amusing?
[2:01:37] <@SoFarFetched> D: pat shoved those women
[2:01:44] <Guardiansaiyan> @hassanico2 I just feel he says that ironically
[2:01:44] <+pectusumbra> Yay
[2:01:45] <RemnanTaka> Does anyone else die a little when Pat runs into people on the street. I couldn't do that even in a game...
[2:01:47] <%HefestoForges> @Blackleafx ah, thanks. It's a great addition but pat won't read
[2:01:49] <%goose_attack_almanac> If nothing else, the Night Queen job confirms Sega fears asses
[2:01:51] <%gnarly_memes_bro> for real tho I bought both dlc weapons and a sword and it popped so I guess I just didn't even know about the spending threshold
[2:01:54] <%WhereIsWill> we should all strive to be as nimble as breakdancer adachi
[2:01:58] <%Jaromero435> WRESTLEMANIAC
[2:02:03] <%toastybites> is there no "avoid battle" item?
[2:02:05] <%rdark_ksu> geif does big woof woof
[2:02:06] <%HefestoForges> oh no he did!
[2:02:08] <NeroInfinite> tribesguard. what
[2:02:10] <%MikeTD81> If you got the most expensive Yakuza 7 game, shouldn't it have personality bossters?
[2:02:12] <%krispen_wa> JACKPOT
[2:02:15] <%sumrand0> "They're breakdance fighting!"
[2:02:19] <%Blackleafx> psaSmug
[2:02:20] <%Jekado> @toastybites There is WAY later....
[2:02:20] <hassanico2> You mentioned it in the podcast
[2:02:21] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> @toastybites Yes there is. its just later in the game
[2:02:22] <fIashman92> @toastybites Yes but it requires bug collecting iirc
[2:02:25] <%Jaromero435> there totally is an item to ignore random battles

[2:07:02] <hassanico2> Is Matriarch's symbol a Sakura LUL
[2:07:03] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> @luckysteak Its just i dont want the final boss to be easy and only have that 1 thing that makes it hard.
[2:07:06] <NitronStreams> For her neutral special Eri wields a GUN
[2:07:06] <kingmemelord97> @fIashman92 nah fam harems can work
[2:07:13] <%gnarly_memes_bro> matriarch is kinda broked
[2:07:13] <tsnakesrule> Romance works like this "Talk to girl and raise bond"
[2:07:14] <%RetroCop87> "Ichiban, you don't understand! We can't help Megumi, we need to have her fight in the war for donations"
[2:07:16] <%Jaromero435> that's a lot of training gear
[2:07:18] <Sol_Install> grandpa stop looking like yoru from the hood
[2:07:20] <$Raikouija> RISING DWAGON!
[2:07:21] <%gnarly_memes_bro> really really good for eri
[2:07:22] <kingmemelord97> and i pulled out my gun
[2:07:29] <%Daniel_Is_I> It kinda sucks how good Matriarch is considering it's DLC only. But for some reason the job XP items are in the base game whether you have the DLC or not.
[2:07:31] <%baronouroboros> we can't because ichiban doesn't become a billionaire canonically until after the main questline ends
[2:07:33] <%baronouroboros> probably
[2:07:39] <%Dunmarkh> help the child
[2:07:45] <%Broken_Sonex> @fIashman92 Nah, man, harem end true end
[2:07:47] <+Spoonsire> Dancer class is so last year, we Breakers now
[2:07:47] <+readreadchopper> I found a box cutter for eri that ignores defense it's pretty PogChamp
[2:08:01] <tsnakesrule> Eri and Saeko you raise them to bond 5 whilst the other girls you chat and give them their favorite thing
[2:08:02] <%GalacticaPhanto> @patstaresat take a taxi to the hospital to finish Megumi quest
[2:08:05] <TyrianPurpleHaze> You know what's crazy? Yokohama's the second-biggest city in Japan, and Ichiban Holdings is the #1 company in the city. Ichiban SHOULD have the second-biggest city in this country by the balls economically.

[2:08:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> DEATH
[2:08:53] <TyrianPurpleHaze> I like how most of the classes use improvised or everyday weapons, but then the Matriarch is just using a fucking polearm.

[2:15:14] <ShichiNoBushi> At the current state of the game, Kasuga can probably just donate a large sum of money to the hospital and have a wing named after him.
[2:15:15] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt I can't believe it actually was 1 million yen that they still need
[2:15:16] <wrydiculous> jesus

[2:15:38] <%krispen_wa> FUCKING DEAD
[2:15:38] <ProfessorLuigi> Matriarch is OP because it's the only one with a real actual weapon
[2:15:42] <%televisedrevolting> HE'S DEAD
[2:15:42] <%walternatorz> is this soul calibur?
[2:15:46] <kingmemelord97> guys i think eri is a god in disguise
[2:15:46] <%Blackleafx> @vaderxyz1970 YES
[2:15:54] <KingVantq> I've been using Dealer havent tried Matriarch yet
[2:15:56] <%Daniel_Is_I> @vaderxyz1970 Yeah substories are canon as hell
[2:15:57] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Eri never killed anyone
[2:15:58] <stabbityrabbit> What the fuck Eri.
[2:16:01] <SomeAsianDood> new skill Pog
[2:16:01] <+doc_ock_rokc> @vaderxyz1970 kinda but mostly yes
[2:16:01] <+senfood> Eri is cute! CUTE!
[2:16:02] <+kawachipto> there are guns
[2:16:04] <%Jaromero435> freelancer sucks
[2:16:05] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Sidequests are literally 80% of every Yakuza game
[2:16:06] <MasterTonberry23> @vaderxyz1970 the short answer is "depends if they feel like referencing it or not"
[2:16:09] <%KineKithZen> Boy is it
[2:16:10] <%MelBrooksKA> @ProfessorLuigi a bat is a pretty good weapon
[2:16:15] <tsnakesrule> Freelancer is fucked
[2:16:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> @ProfessorLuigi Excuse you, a bat is a weapon
[2:16:18] <%wheelchairman91> I like pat's description that this game takes place in the real world, but the Anime dimension.
[2:16:21] <%sumrand0> Ichiban= Mistress????? Yes?!?!?!
[2:16:23] <GigaSeifer> Yeah, I leveled my freelancer with books from can collecting
[2:16:35] <kingmemelord97> can eri defeat Gilgamesh chat ?
[2:16:35] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @PatStaresAt You get an item later to level up Freelancer really fast, so you can grind it for stats later on.
[2:16:36] <%Lion_kun> Gotta grind it to 28 eventually
[2:16:37] <+senfood> What's the purpose of Freelancer again? Is it like Onion Knight or something?
[2:16:39] <%Daniel_Is_I> Yeah Freelancer is only for when you're at the end of the game and can get up to 24 in like two battles, then never touch it again
[2:16:39] <%AzureGale> I got freelancer to Rank 8 for the character skill and never looked back
[2:16:41] <KingVantq> If Freelancer has a weapon it would probably be decent
[2:16:41] <%baronouroboros> The naginata is blunted, so Eri never killed anyone
[2:16:44] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Freelancer sucks but you get a fucking Multi-class Suplex at lv 26
[2:16:46] <KingVantq> had
[2:16:49] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> Freelancer is the best job if you want to have some challenge
[2:16:51] <%Sausious> just stay hero
[2:16:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> DEVIL ROCKER
[2:16:51] <%baronouroboros> Rubber bullets too
[2:17:06] <%AzureGale> It's a rubber naginata
[2:17:07] <%Caped_Eggy> Oh it's we are the world
[2:17:08] <+vicar_anat> wuh oh
[2:17:09] <Idon__> Rubber Naginata
[2:17:09] <%honeyman18> I keep going for the best hybrid skills
[2:17:10] <%Lion_kun> DEVIL ROCKER
[2:17:12] <MasterTonberry23> assuming they keep ichiban for the next game (and I hope they do) i wonder if they'll make him being a billionare businessman canon
[2:17:12] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> It heard you praise it and now it is flustered
[2:17:14] <%Broken_Sonex> Wireless is a cuck
[2:17:16] <Visorak6> Controller at risk
[2:17:17] <Ravingpyro> oh no
[2:17:17] <%sumrand0> PlayStat- oh it died before it could finish it's name
[2:17:17] <%BoxNavy> are you considering a long ass cord
[2:17:20] <fIashman92> iirc musician's heal is a set 10% heal no matter what, so you can give it to everyone
[2:17:21] <echobee_tv> Thanks for the 2020Pajamas @neonpopt
[2:17:24] <andritt> uh oh
[2:17:28] <%KineKithZen> Is the controller not being detected by the operating system or is it the Steam integration?
[2:17:29] <+abrupt_abe> Pepper OP
[2:17:32] <%Daniel_Is_I> Hopefully it's just steam and not your controller dying in under a month
[2:17:33] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> You need 9 confidence he cant do devil rocker
[2:17:33] <stabbityrabbit> DEVIL ROCKER
[2:17:35] <MasterTonberry23> wireless controllers? eww
[2:17:37] <%Ipsenscastle> Paige will have fucked it up somehow
[2:17:40] <SharKinStereo> chef
[2:17:40] <%Jaromero435> all breakers all the time
[2:17:41] <echobee_tv> Breaker has some good stuff
[2:17:41] <%slrls_> Chef is a killing machine with the pressure cooker slam
[2:17:42] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Breaker AoE is good
[2:17:44] <Blank9> ichi de chef
[2:17:44] <lirikplaysboringgames69> nioh > bloodborne > demon souls > dark souls > yakuza
[2:17:46] <%KineKithZen> i.e. losing Bluetooth pairing to Windows
[2:17:47] <%NeedlesD> Chef to 10, get that pepper
[2:17:49] <TyrianPurpleHaze> I say go with Breaker
[2:17:52] <%Daniel_Is_I> Chef is great. Peppermill Blow is BUSTED
[2:17:55] <%Blackleafx> HAVE CONFIDENCE
[2:17:55] <%MrBorisMakarov> have confidence
[2:17:58] <%gnarly_memes_bro> peppermill is legitimately great
[2:17:58] <%Blackleafx> no confidence....

[2:18:07] <%sumrand0> NO CONFIDENCE
[2:18:09] <echobee_tv> Oh yeah get the hero stuff
[2:18:12] <seaechiowai> sounds good
[2:18:12] <HedgehogGames1> Chef hat makes his hair look not good.
[2:18:14] <%honeyman18> Big Time Changes! i love that SekiemaII look
[2:18:14] <akitanito> Replacement nanba

[2:18:21] <ProfessorLuigi> ONly breakers!
[2:18:21] <stabbityrabbit> Keep him hero...until DEVIL ROCKER.
[2:18:25] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Yeah Chef Peppermill does waaaay too mmuch damage
[2:18:25] <TyrianPurpleHaze> His hair looks even worse with that hat.
[2:18:26] <h0wiewong> Chef weirdly enough has the most brutal moves I feel
[2:18:31] <%krispen_wa> BULLET OF HONOR
[2:18:33] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[2:18:36] <%Jekado> it did get an update
[2:18:37] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> 3 musicians is a good build
[2:18:45] <%Jamejarrs> The move you get from Chef is like one of the best in the game
[2:18:47] <akitanito> It looks like he could be bald under that hat
[2:18:51] <GigaSeifer> it's tongs or something
[2:18:53] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> Chef Ichiban
[2:18:53] <%gnarly_memes_bro> Peppermill blow is ridiculously strong
[2:19:07] <MasterTonberry23> honestly you dont have to worry about playing the meta team comp
[2:19:07] <%Bailey__gaming> @patstaresat you upgrade Eri's nagitana
[2:19:11] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> You can see Weakness on enermies if you already faced them when you confirm moves
[2:19:13] <%gnarly_memes_bro> yeah the court tongs, think that subquest opens up in another chapter or two
[2:19:15] <%krispen_wa> Is this game just Hobo Final Fantasy V?
[2:19:19] <stabbityrabbit> @h0wiewong You clearly haven't seen an angry cook. It's not weird at all.
[2:19:20] <%honeyman18> I highly recomend the Kaeda substory if you haven't yet

[2:57:12] <%AzureGale> What are the odds Ichiban is going to fight during this substory
[2:57:13] <%honeyman18> I just want him to use the space laser to solve problems so it's cannon

[2:57:45] <%Sausious> you should pay attention to thuis
[2:57:45] <%alcors_wisdom> theres no china town in my state
[2:57:46] <+Gespens> Most major cities have a town for a major immigrant demographic

[2:57:47] <%Jekado> SF is Chinatown...
[2:57:49] <+Tadashi047> major cities

[2:58:02] <+twohitgood> everywhere with a significant population of any ethnic type will have a "town" of that type. whether it's little italy or chinatown or koreatown or little tokyo, etc etc.
[2:58:02] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Chinatown seems like a loaded termnow
[2:58:02] <%MelBrooksKA> It's right next to China too
[2:58:03] <@SoFarFetched> But was for a historic reason
[2:58:05] <%coreyyotto> it's like four blocks but it counts
[2:58:06] <%Daniel_Is_I> Detroit has had two chinatowns, but doesn't currently have one iirc
[2:58:06] <+Mitchellsocks> I bought a meat bun the size of my FACE in Yokohama's Chnatown

[2:58:53] <%QueequegTheater> Tell me more, not-Makoto
[2:58:54] <%BoxNavy> ayamis voice is cute
[2:58:54] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> WHo doesnt love Super stuffed up Buns
[2:58:57] <%NeedlesD> i want that pig
[2:59:00] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt That is a comedy statue and legend to get people to show up
[2:59:00] <askouijabird> she can rub my swine la tong
[2:59:01] <%promessav2> plaque says sanraaton
[2:59:06] <olaksi> That sounds like nonsense they come up with for tourists
[2:59:09] <%Omegaanimus> I used to live in Korea Town here in NJ...it's pretty much several counties
[2:59:09] <%SomeSageAdvice> and its right ear is shiny where people have been rubbing it, nice detail
[2:59:09] <+Gespens> Vancouver has like, 2 Chinatowns
[2:59:13] <BerryliciousDefinition> RIGHT EAR 4 TIMES GOT IT

[2:59:16] <%rdark_ksu> eh puns crossing languages is hard
[2:59:18] <%sumrand0> @sirgo0se yeah it does, it's actually impress and warped my sense of how cool other chinatowns are haha
[2:59:21] <%wheelchairman91> The story behind Jewish neighbourhoods are usually pretty dark, at least in Europe.
[2:59:26] <%sumrand0> impressive
[2:59:27] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Cool
[2:59:34] <+Mitchellsocks> I second the Philly Chinatown's dope stance
[2:59:37] <%PhantomMiG> The ear is discolored it a nice touch
[2:59:40] <%XeroSigmaPrime> New York and all the surrounding metropolitan cities have a total of 12 chinatowns
[2:59:45] <%QueequegTheater> Is there a Step Up-esque dance rivalry between them
[2:59:49] <%wheelchairman91> Jews were often heavily restricted in where they could settle and what they could do.
[2:59:52] <%rdark_ksu> also helps if you dont speak langauge to be near ppl who you can actually speak to
[2:59:54] <moodygabes> is there a france town in montreal?
[2:59:56] <kingmemelord97> germany really ?

[3:02:01] <Samuraiflame> they just move to the suburbs
[3:02:01] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> Sometimes they make a new gate
[3:02:01] <%coreyyotto> you expand up
[3:02:02] <%doomunderthestairs> new gate
[3:02:03] <+twohitgood> the gate becomes the mainstreet hub and more of a center.
[3:02:03] <%shiplord13> Move the gate or build new one
[3:02:04] <@SoFarFetched> you can't cause the main city is trying to do Gentrification
[3:02:05] <%mike2hands> BIGGER GATE
[3:02:05] <tsnakesrule> @raziwraith they are dlc yeah, 5$
[3:02:05] <xbb1024> I know, they build a second gate a bit further
[3:02:05] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:02:05] <+D00msDayDan> move it
[3:02:06] <+Gespens> It's usually not a formal entrance, or they make a new gate
[3:02:07] <%kafra20> you expand it upwards

[3:02:11] <$lotharrio> Here? You don't, you push all the other, poor Chinese, to a new neighborhood.
[3:02:11] <%rdark_ksu> move the gate posts
[3:02:12] <%RealThiele> GATE-O OPEN
[3:02:13] <%Ipsenscastle> In manchester the gate ended up in the middle

[3:02:17] <%Jaxnos> gg pat

[3:02:26] <@SoFarFetched> Cause the Chinatown that's an hour away from me is slowly being Gentrified
[3:02:29] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt Just put a plaque on the old gate that says "previous boundry of chinatown
[3:02:30] <brachydios777> PUSH IT SOMEWHERE ELSE
[3:02:32] <%alcors_wisdom> they actually typically move the old one because its sorta a thing to keep the gate at the "front" of the city
[3:02:34] <%HefestoForges> blindness* shit
[3:02:37] <akitanito> Pat is super confidence
[3:02:37] <fIashman92> No review?

[3:12:08] <%Omegaanimus> Dragons are part lizard, bat, lion aspects
[3:12:08] <%coreyyotto> But dragons were a thing before dinosaurs were discovered, right?
[3:12:09] <Zarkith> People didn't know about dinasours a thousand years ago though
[3:12:09] <bigtitsmagree> breathing fire is common tho
[3:12:12] <Hideow> Dinossaur fossils
[3:12:13] <StarlitStunner> Big fookin lizards
[3:12:14] <Guilgameshx> Lizards are an instinctual fear
[3:12:14] <OneThousandTomatoes> dinosaur bones and inherrent fear of snakes
[3:12:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Because Birds are Scaley
[3:12:15] <akitanito> Baton twirl his shit
[3:12:15] <TRZZXQ> That kind of thing happens all the time in world history. Stuff develops independently in different places
[3:12:15] <%sumrand0> SHE'LL KILL YOU
[3:12:17] <%honeyman18> I hope she has a gun
[3:12:17] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt Don't forget the Americas and their dragon like creatures. Like the feathered Serpent
[3:12:19] <+MrMcCrabby> Its because dragons are actually just ancient mothmen
[3:12:21] <NeroInfinite> IS SHE GONNA BE A SUMMON?
[3:12:22] <The_Legendairy> yeah that's not your job lady
[3:12:23] <%rdark_ksu> well the greeks thought mamoth bones were cyclops so prob bones and shit
[3:12:23] <%Daniel_Is_I> Does Japan usually have this many thugs harassing people who bump into them?
[3:12:24] <Heroes_of_Vale> Who is this man asking a tiny lady tour guide to shield them? Pathetic.
[3:12:27] <%coreyyotto> Like King Arthur and all that shit was from the Middle Ages wasn't it?
[3:12:28] <Quivla> the first confirmed Dino fossil wasn't discovered til after George washington died
[3:12:29] <%Omegaanimus> A LOT of myths are just composite animals
[3:12:30] <+vaderxyz1970> Thats dedication to the job
[3:12:31] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Dragons were real, but didn't make it on the arc.
[3:12:31] <SaltyAzteca> WHA
[3:12:32] <%BoxNavy> SECRET PARTY MEMBER

[3:12:51] <%NovaKnightmare> DONT SHOW UR BALLS AYAMI
[3:12:51] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Dinosouars combined the fear from we were smaller apes of being killed by eagles
[3:12:53] <@SoFarFetched> "ANATA!"
[3:12:54] <%Omegaanimus> King Arthur goes back to the Roman occupation
[3:12:55] <Hideow> Lady,not here Kappa
[3:12:56] <%wheelchairman91> I'M A BIGGER YAKUZI THAN YOU SIR
[3:12:56] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> @PatStaresAt it's a good question, but many Indo-European cultures have a "Chaos Dragon" fighting a "Storm God" mythology, and weirdly this includes unrelated Japan and Australian Aborigines
[3:12:58] <%Cn_alpha_02> Watch the fakeumentary “Dragons A Fantasy Made Real” at explains why all cultures have dragons.

[4:05:31] <Saltmeisterr> I SAW GUN
[4:05:31] <moodygabes> NUT QUEEN
[4:05:33] <%WhereIsWill> go to bed, wake up to influencer cash in YEYEYE
[4:05:36] <fIashman92> Dealer is best imo
[4:05:36] <Saltmeisterr> I SAW A GUNN
[4:05:42] <RaidenRising> G.U.N
[4:05:43] <%Daniel_Is_I> Dealer's Darts Airstrike is probably the best single target damage skill in the game
[4:05:45] <%NopeBadguy> How many subs for us to get you to put the whole party in the Ono Michio head?
[4:05:47] <Hellarussian> GUN
[4:05:49] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> Dealer is trash.
[4:05:55] <%baronouroboros> gun gun gun
[4:05:59] <%wheelchairman91> the power of GUN
[4:06:01] <fIashman92> Dealer has a gun move
[4:06:02] <%StaceMcGate> Dealer is great
[4:06:04] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt gun skill
[4:06:06] <%baronouroboros> one guy
[4:06:07] <%Daniel_Is_I> Dealer is amazing, what are you talking about
[4:06:13] <%AzureGale> WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MANY TRAINING GEARS
[4:06:16] <%NopeBadguy> Dealer has a few pierce moves
[4:06:17] <%honeyman18> it's just darts
[4:06:19] <%NopeBadguy> Darts Airstrike is BUSTED
[4:06:20] <moodygabes> that essence of russian roulette though
[4:06:21] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> and is the best move
[4:06:22] <%charp35> Darts is one of the best moves
[4:06:23] <h0wiewong> It's real strong
[4:06:26] <Hellarussian> YEYEYEY
[4:06:28] <%NopeBadguy> Essence of Russian Roulette is pretty good
[4:06:28] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt Matriach gun move is the best however
[4:06:28] <OneThousandTomatoes> hmmm
[4:06:30] <%dancekumquat> i'm getting this game tomorrow and i can't wait
[4:06:32] <%krispen_wa> DARTZ
[4:06:32] <%Monkeyweed21> YO THAT MOVE IS LEGIT
[4:06:33] <%NopeBadguy> Except when it kills you
[4:06:33] <%honeyman18> STRONG, 3 raandom hits
[4:06:35] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> Dealer has like 3 good moves.
[4:06:36] <SchroedingersFerret> Essence of G U N
[4:06:36] <h0wiewong> You can team kill with that one and it's hilarious
[4:06:36] <Dr00_PhD> It's real good
[4:06:38] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Russian Roulette is garbage but Darts Airstrike is AMAZING
[4:06:42] <%Noogiez> haha
[4:06:43] <%NopeBadguy> I wiped in a boss fight because Russian Roulette killed Ichiban instantly @PatStaresAt
[4:06:43] <%wheelchairman91> I love these losers
[4:06:46] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Oh my god it's the Dragon Quest Jester job
[4:06:46] <PkSilent01> The ultimate weapon for Dealer is in the Casino with the blackjack table
[4:06:46] <%PigGuy800> i feel like there's a "they took our jobs" joke to be made here
[4:06:47] <CelestialCage> I love these failures
[4:06:48] <missingangle> This group is nutso
[4:06:50] <Ultimatefool> Matriarch has some great gun moves
[4:06:52] <%gnarly_memes_bro> darts airstrike is pretty good, you can't give the girls fulminating forecast so its the next best choice
[4:06:53] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> Lucky and unlucky dice. and darts
[4:06:54] <%wheelchairman91> I love how not Kiryu he is
[4:06:57] <%Jekado> dart is good because it hits 1 person 3 times if they are the only ones there
[4:06:57] <%miguelrod777> they are heroes oat what are you talking babout
[4:07:01] <%wheelchairman91> and I loved Kiryu
[4:07:11] <Hellarussian> its the cast of Grease
[4:07:13] <Justaguy3> it looks like a wierd college film crew
[4:07:14] <%Omegaanimus> Eri with both shadow stitch and airdarts is ridiculous
[4:07:15] <%radda343> if you use darts airstrike on a single enemy it does big number
[4:07:19] <%VHGS> @gnarly_memes_bro it hits a single target multiple times, so it's SIGNIFICANTLY better than fulminating forecast
[4:07:51] <%Daniel_Is_I> Yeah it says medium damage but it does more than most extreme skills
[4:07:52] <%gnarly_memes_bro> I'm aware, I just prefer using single target moves if I want to hit one guy.
[4:08:00] <%AzureGale> We just met, and this is crazy, but here's my number, so call me maybe?
[4:08:13] <%honeyman18> it's a guaranteed three hits so it's pretty great, reliable aoe
[4:08:19] <xbb1024> Has Pat done any story this stream?
[4:08:26] <CelestialCage> Adachi and Nanba as dancers make me laugh
[4:08:26] <%BoxNavy> stop it
[4:08:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> Pat
[4:08:27] <%gnarly_memes_bro> in terms of widespread effective usage nothing has done more work than fulminating for me

[4:56:45] <Jonny_Uppercut> Elmo gives him the cute feet (beep beep)
[4:56:45] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> The play bow, is a very formal thing that must be respected
[4:56:45] <%wheelchairman91> Oh it's so good to see the OG baby
[4:56:46] <CelestialCage> to be STRONG
[4:56:52] <%Broken_Sonex> I imagine Elmo vs Zangeif would go down like DDP vs Goldberg
[4:56:53] <garbageheaphound> OH FUCK I DIDNT KNOW THAT PART
[4:56:59] <garbageheaphound> I GOTTA START DOIN THAT
[4:57:00] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> Why not play football with the elderly?
[4:57:01] <%SirGO0SE> ah, fire emblem rules
[4:57:02] <%wheelchairman91> love you peepee
[4:57:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> Pat aren't you already OP enough?
[4:57:14] <garbageheaphound> I THOUGHT THAT WAS FOR THE CLASS
[4:57:15] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> hyper swagger
[4:57:17] <%ZephynM> So if you stick to a job skill long enough, you can gain permanent stat boosts. Sounds like a similar thing Tales of Berseria uses with Equipment skills.
[4:57:18] <%yeknomlive> i didnt know the stats carried over
[4:57:18] <CelestialCage> MUST BE STRONGER.
[4:57:19] <%Jekado> yeah its why getting 30 in all jobs is really good for end game
[4:57:21] <+possumwalsh1221> I didn’t realiZe those stat boosts were permanent until I almost beat it LUL
[4:57:22] <HedgehogGames1> Peppermill Blow is really good.
[4:57:23] <%Daxalog> Are their Red Stat ups?
[4:57:27] <%Jekado> since you get all the skills and permeant boots
[4:57:27] <+GuyNooN> GET THAT MAGIC UP AND USE THE HAMMER OF DAWN
[4:57:33] <+BeezusHrist> how dis game?
[4:57:36] <%wheelchairman91> @PatStaresAt I tweeted you a pic of my cat please respond
[4:57:37] <aluddss> greens are per class, reds are perma?
[4:57:39] <Viidream13> the additional stat's not exclusive to their jobs?
[4:57:43] <illtima> I'm stil trying to level everyone's initial jobs to 28
[4:57:44] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> So Pat wants the exaggerated swagger of a black teen?
[4:57:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> there are plenty of RPG's that do that, though there's enough that I can't think of any right now
[4:57:48] <%krispen_wa> SEXY POSE
[4:57:54] <%radda343> G U N
[4:58:00] <%chibicheezit> but don't you wanna learn peppermill blow?
[4:58:03] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> I coulda swore Stats were job specific
[4:58:04] <%trustycoyote> @aluddss Yep you got it
[4:58:06] <%radda343> Eri as Matriarch is the endgame
[4:58:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I guess one could remember Octopath has skills that move between jobs
[4:58:16] <%supersugoisenpai1> Did you get a job item for Adachi?
[4:58:17] <%coreyyotto> the stat ups are to their base stats, then each job has additional stat boosts on top of it
[4:58:18] <aluddss> cool
[4:58:19] <MarvelousMrD> so nanba has got to be dead by now right
[4:58:21] <CassidyAlacrity> Namba's missing out
[4:58:25] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> The only class that confused me was that Saeko's unique job for Barmaid gives her a lot of Magic up, but she can only really learn like, 3 spells that are magic damage. I guess since Barmaid is themed after buffs and debuffs that those have something to do with Magic as a stat
[4:58:28] <%TerumiYuki> pat that boom box you got gives extra job xp for breaker i believe
[4:58:29] <%Kataguro> A story about a boy and his love of milfs
[4:58:31] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> IS IT STORY TIME?
[4:58:35] <missingangle> So we find a rat...
[4:58:36] <CelestialCage> We have the training gear to get nanba caught up
[4:58:37] <%krispen_wa> Namba is gaining the Cursed Mark right now
[4:58:40] <%TerumiYuki> i think its an accessory
[4:58:48] <%Dova573> learning to cook and fucking milfs
[4:58:50] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Freelancer Sucks but you get German Suplex

[5:16:19] <@commanderclaw> It was so bad it almost killed Yakuza
[5:16:19] <%krispen_wa> The Karaoke was good
[5:16:21] <%owazowski> OLD MAN
[5:16:22] <%Niney_Who> Legit only watch the Cutscenes and Karaoke never play it
[5:16:23] <Pookiedaexzile> awwwww
[5:16:25] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> So dead souls LP next?
[5:16:25] <%Mr_Pylon> Are the cutscenes even any good?
[5:16:26] <+MrLittleSam> ty for heads up
[5:16:27] <CelestialCage> a bad game with good moments
[5:16:31] <DrGasMax> It is also the game that killed Yakuza in the west
[5:16:31] <Purpleleven> Man's actually made of paper
[5:16:31] <%honeyman18> The Majima cutscene is alright
[5:16:31] <SeruraRenge> It would be a lot better if the framerate didn't constantly tank
[5:16:32] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Just watch the cutscenes
[5:16:33] <%RealThiele> not dead cells tho thats awesome
[5:16:33] <%arcielardor> I keep thinking dark souls
[5:16:34] <stevenlambchops> BUT MAJIMA'S GET TO THE TOP THOUGH
[5:16:34] <Meriokingston> psaBig psaBig
[5:16:35] <CelestialCage> @mr_pylon yes
[5:16:35] <%ThatGuyThere03> So when are you gonna play it on stream?
[5:16:35] <missingangle> oof
[5:16:36] <CptJeezus> were the ancient Japan games good?
[5:16:37] <Sulfur_Boride> Dead Souls nearly killed Yakuza in the west
[5:16:40] <osaka_daioh> I still wanna play it.
[5:16:40] <devanmuse> but is Dead Souls CANON?
[5:16:41] <+CannonHeroBrett> @CapnClassix you see anyone talking about that garbage? lol
[5:16:41] <seaechiowai> they went maximum silly and minimum gameplay
[5:16:42] <Otatoptohami> i thought it was alright until like halfway through
[5:16:44] <+DukeBlack_> dead souls 2
[5:16:46] <@SSaryn> Dead Souls has a lot of good ideas.. it's not great.
[5:16:48] <lumenglow> daigo puts on a dress in that one though
[5:16:49] <@SSaryn> Not at all.
[5:16:50] <CelestialCage> A BAD SHOOTER
[5:16:52] <+MooseyFate100> Yakuza being a shooter makes no sense
[5:16:53] <DrGasMax> They banked HARD on Dead Souls breaking out in the west
[5:16:53] <%ghostofsolomon> it was a trend having zombos in your games
[5:16:53] <%krispen_wa> Isshin was good
[5:16:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Dead Souls is Cannon
[5:16:57] <%Mr_Pylon> @CelestialCage cool
[5:16:58] <tidalwafer> aww man but zombies
[5:17:03] <missingangle> Wait, it's a shooter? As a yakuza game? Ew
[5:17:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Dead Souls Happened shut up
[5:17:07] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Why the fuck is there a BAD ZOMBIE SHOOTER Yakuza game
[5:17:07] <artsupplies> ishin is so good
[5:17:08] <%AtlasMcCoy> What the fuck kinda restaurant is this?
[5:17:11] <+tigerfang86> YOURE STOPPING MY CHEF SCAM
[5:17:13] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> Fist of the North Star yakuza was different. Instead of fighting the person YOU ACTUALLY KILL THEM
[5:17:15] <%StaceMcGate> I'LL KILL YOU
[5:17:15] <GeltonZ> That's a bit of a streach, Yakuza had BEEN dead in the West. It's complicated and dumb.
[5:17:16] <+MooseyFate100> you wanna be startin somethin
[5:17:16] <%coreyyotto> Play Binary Domain instead
[5:17:16] <%miguelrod777> I'll kill you
[5:17:16] <+tigerfang86> ILL KILL YOU
[5:17:18] <%NeedlesD> the Yakuza game did wind up making a good shooter later right, Binary Domain
[5:17:18] <DrGasMax> Even crazier they made fucking Binary Domain the next year which is decent is forgettable
[5:17:18] <Pookiedaexzile> ILL KILL
[5:17:19] <%krispen_wa> I'LL KILL YOU
[5:17:20] <NitronStreams> ILL KILL YOU
[5:17:20] <%Niney_Who> CHEF FIGHT
[5:17:20] <Berendenn> KILL
[5:17:22] <@SSaryn> I should mention Dead Souls has actually has some good Majima moments but.. yeah. Just Youtube those.
[5:17:22] <%wheelchairman91> THEY'LL KILL YOU
[5:17:22] <+Mitchellsocks> There's a Zombie Hostess substory in Dead Souls
[5:17:23] <CelestialCage> ILL KILL YOU
[5:17:24] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> I like how you immediately gang up on the two chefs
[5:17:25] <%Broken_Sonex> JUST LOOK UP THE CUTSCENES
[5:17:25] <bigtitsmagree> IM MAD ABOUT THAT
[5:17:26] <fuji_92> I'll kill u
[5:17:32] <+CapnClassix> Good to know, Was wondering which ones to skip
[5:17:34] <ManlyMcBeefington> Does Daigo's gun animation come from Dead Souls?
[5:17:37] <+g4mejoy> I'll KILL YOU!
[5:17:38] <%sighphers> i'll kiryu
[5:17:38] <GeltonZ> Binary Domain is great year
[5:17:45] <HedgehogGames1> On Legend difficulty the QTEs are apparently too fast for normal human to even react to.
[5:17:46] <%Niney_Who> SPLAT
[5:17:47] <%AngryAsian5> DED
[5:17:52] <%krispen_wa> DED
[5:17:56] <OneThousandTomatoes> LUL the pose
[5:17:56] <Sulfur_Boride> Dead Souls had a side mission where Majima almost kissed Daigo
[5:17:56] <%solracc25> I'll kill you
[5:17:59] <+MooseyFate100> I'm getting stronger HeyGuys
[5:18:00] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> @PatStaresAt Did you play Fist of the North Star lost paradice?
[5:18:10] <%krispen_wa> Jesus
[5:18:13] <Jflaskd13> LUL
[5:18:13] <%krispen_wa> that's a fucking threat
[5:18:13] <+TJM357> that was ridiculous 10/10
[5:18:18] <%wheelchairman91> How was the fist of the north star yakuzi game?
[5:18:23] <DrGasMax> Dead Souls does happen in a alt timeline where Ryuji Goda lives and gets a sick ass gun arm so that is a positive
[5:18:23] <@SSaryn> It's.. fine. With more than tedious heat actions.
[5:18:23] <%wheelchairman91> oh he just said
[5:18:28] <%NopeBadguy> Lost Paradise is real fun
[5:18:28] <UlriktheSlayer1> did you see those people DISAPPEAR INTO THE WALL
[5:18:29] <hassanico2> it was alright
[5:18:32] <colzack_> Not the best of their games but it's good
[5:18:32] <Meriokingston> Its pretty okay
[5:18:32] <+zanzibar_junker> it was fun
[5:18:33] <@SoFarFetched> yeah its alright
[5:18:34] <ShichiNoBushi> HE'LL KILL US!!
[5:18:35] <SeruraRenge> I 100%ed it
[5:18:35] <+dante_must_die_exe> wasn't bad
[5:18:36] <rafflespaddock> i did, it was cool
[5:18:36] <%SunnyVarietyPack> i did
[5:18:36] <%yeknomlive> wish the hnk had karaoke
[5:18:37] <%Jaller101514> it was about a 7 or 8 out of 10
[5:18:38] <+CapnClassix> @PatStaresAt I've been playing it, it's alright
[5:18:39] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Yeah,it's just okay
[5:18:39] <%SunnyVarietyPack> it was ok
[5:18:40] <hassanico2> Also they fucking DMCA cutscenes of Lost Paradise to hell and back!
[5:18:40] <CelestialCage> I hear of FOTNS being worse than most yakuza hames but still a good game
[5:18:40] <+mywifeleftme_dot_mp4> It's eeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhh
[5:18:41] <+GingerStrawhat> I did, it was pretty decent. Like a pretty solid licensed game
[5:18:42] <%Alazull> @patstaresat I did
[5:18:43] <judodoffy> The combats fun
[5:18:44] <DrGasMax> I am playing it now, it is another game in the 0,5,Kiwami engine
[5:18:44] <%MikeTD81> it was alright
[5:18:44] <%Yautjabutts> Better than Dead Souls
[5:18:46] <%GalacticaPhanto> it was fine. not amazing but still enjoyable
[5:18:46] <+yuna67876> It was ok
[5:18:49] <+zanzibar_junker> it's the most kenshiro has ever talked
[5:18:50] <%baronouroboros> Jim Sterling liked it
[5:18:51] <Pookiedaexzile> SCP Y4K : I'll Kill you The city of Kamurocho is infected by a spirit that consumes the consciousness of the residents selectively, causing violent outrage
[5:18:51] <%Garthunox> Its really fun
[5:18:52] <%Alazull> It's fun
[5:18:54] <hassanico2> It's nigh impossible to put up videos of FotNS on Youtube
[5:18:54] <%Garthunox> Yes i did
[5:18:55] <kalelis985> It was fun
[5:18:56] <@SSaryn> It's just got some really tedious heat actions and the drving is ok.
[5:18:56] <%wheelchairman91> I love fist of the north star
[5:18:56] <%AgniBrandt> I legit loved Fist of the North Star
[5:18:58] <CelestialCage> Its a good fotns game
[5:18:58] <%NopeBadguy> It's better than Kiwami
[5:18:58] <+GingerStrawhat> Reminds me of The Warriors and how people remember liking that game
[5:19:02] <%Garthunox> Its really fun and a great time
[5:19:03] <%SunnyVarietyPack> yea it was the best fist of the north star game
[5:19:03] <%MikeTD81> it was short i heard
[5:19:05] <%VHGS> the second best hnk game, I guess
[5:19:07] <colzack_> Has some really great boss fights and boss themes though
[5:19:07] <amonimis> yeah pretty much that
[5:19:08] <%T_Sasquatch> driving sucked ass tho
[5:19:11] <SeruraRenge> @PatStaresAt It's legitimately the best FotNS game ever made because it gives a shit about being a good game and not just fanservice
[5:19:11] <%coreyyotto> You just got the Chef EXP UP accessory btw
[5:19:11] <%SunnyVarietyPack> its an average yakuza game
[5:19:12] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt It had Amon in it
[5:19:13] <%ghostofsolomon> @patstaresat i saw a Judgenent Eyes on your ps5 screen. is there a chance u will letsplay that?
[5:19:14] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> It was an Ok Yakuza game. its like Yakuza 0 but with more focus on the fighting
[5:19:15] <%StaceMcGate> 🎶 🎶 🎶 🎶
[5:19:16] <SirDogBear> its fun, wish it sold better BibleThump
[5:19:16] <%Alazull> a lot more basic, but the cocktail game is hilarious
[5:19:17] <Meriokingston> It's not a great Yakuza game but better than those beat em ups
[5:19:21] <+tigerfang86> THEME OF SAD
[5:19:22] <%murderof_crows> It is
[5:19:22] <colzack_> Like some of the best boss fights they've done
[5:19:23] <%sighphers> a-are you snitching on me, kasuga-san?
[5:19:26] <@SSaryn> MAKE RICE DAMN YOU

[5:19:35] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Theme of DAD
[5:19:42] <%Garthunox> Kiryu voice Ken
[5:19:42] <%Jaller101514> an 8 out of 10 from a series of 9 or 10 out of 10s
[5:19:43] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> He's been crying into the rice
[5:19:43] <%SunnyVarietyPack> the hokuto skills are actually fun to do
[5:19:44] <+FxyDEV> this sub story has VO?
[5:19:46] <NitronStreams> EAT A DAKIMAS
[5:19:47] <Meriokingston> watch him still not like it
[5:19:50] <%AtlasMcCoy> You can tell this is a good restaurant because the inside looks like garbage
[5:19:51] <%Broken_Sonex> It great if you love Fist of The North Star
[5:19:51] <@commanderclaw> Too bad
[5:19:52] <+tigerfang86> I want fried rice.....

[5:20:15] <Dr00_PhD> Every substory has vo for the begining and ending cutscenes
[5:20:16] <+possumwalsh1221> Sadge someday
[5:20:16] <%Alazull> @patstaresat I think Lost Paradise is a really good one to pick up on sale
[5:20:17] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> salty...FROM THE TEARS
[5:20:20] <Jflaskd13> too salty from his tears
[5:20:22] <CelestialCage> is he crying
[5:20:22] <%AzureGale> WHY WAS THAT THE END
[5:20:22] <@SoFarFetched> "Who put all these tears in my fried rice"
[5:20:23] <+MrLittleSam> In the before times when you could in restaurants
[5:20:25] <%krispen_wa> SO DID HE FUCK THE MILF?
[5:20:26] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Okay empty sells it more than anything
[5:20:27] <DrGasMax> it feels like a Yakuza part in like 4 or 5 where you play as a new character with unique stuff but it is stretched over an entire game
[5:20:27] <%bevyrage> salty from the tears
[5:20:28] <Meriokingston> that sounds amazing four bucks
[5:20:28] <SeruraRenge> The only downside of Lost Paradise is it has one hell of a grind sidequest to make 100 million in cash through the hostess club
[5:20:29] <+Saggitori> the donki ferris wheel?
[5:20:29] <Pakooboomi> wholesome af
[5:20:30] <+GrandmasterBFunk> The best curry places in japan is a hole in the wall place you find in a back street

[5:21:37] <%BoxNavy> @sofarfetched ew dont remind him
[5:21:39] <SeruraRenge> You can do that right now if you just have no fear of death because you got nothing going for ya anyway
[5:21:41] <%YakumoYomi> You know, Woolie and V shared the same sentiment when playing Yakuza 0 earlier.
[5:21:41] <%PigGuy800> wait was that safe there unopened
[5:21:43] <%StebTheVee> Everyone is becoming shutins
[5:21:45] <%SirGO0SE> at least you have us :)
[5:21:45] <%StaceMcGate> Safe's respawn chat
[5:21:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> as someone who almost never leaves the house, it's just now starting to hit me, but yeah man this sucks

[5:22:05] <%GalacticaPhanto> I mean when was the last time you saw Woolie in person?
[5:22:07] <redrins> masks better be staying, but I cant wait until the goings ons end
[5:22:14] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> I hope you all are safe and finding the love you need
[5:22:17] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Yeah not great year on the whole. Gonna say one of the less good ones I;ve been apart of
[5:22:20] <%baronouroboros> time for story yeyeyeye
[5:22:23] <CelestialCage> These streams have been helpcu l
[5:22:27] <CelestialCage> helpful
[5:22:28] <@SoFarFetched> yeah silver chests respawn
[5:22:31] <%SuckerPunchSyd> My parents went to a wedding last weekend even though I’ve been staying inside for the past year. Everything sucks yo
[5:22:32] <+zanzibar_junker> those we're all great sidequests
[5:22:32] <redrins> mine never respawned
[5:22:32] <%wheelchairman91> It's so depressing, thank goodness for twitch streams and warhammer. And my cat
[5:22:34] <%ghostofsolomon> i had to go weddings that limit to 50 - 100 people
[5:22:37] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> They do?
[5:22:38] <kalelis985> Adachi sucks with caster classes
[5:22:38] <%wruce__billis> this year is worse than 2001
[5:22:39] <+CapnClassix> @PatStaresAt I feel that. One of my best friends is moving to Japan in January and I probably won't get to hang with him one last time before he moves
[5:22:45] <@SoFarFetched> They Respawn it just takes a LONG while
[5:22:45] <%ek117> Dude someone Re-edited "The Slap"to be a Yakuzie cutscene

[5:26:04] <Pakooboomi> 40%?
[5:26:04] <%strakillias> Crunchy peanut butter is a crime against god
[5:26:05] <SirDogBear> yea it was epic PogChamp
[5:26:07] <GustauveVIII> it feels like half yeah
[5:26:07] <Dr00_PhD> Quite a bit
[5:26:07] <+Raspada_Ryner> About halfway
[5:26:08] <+GingerStrawhat> Like almost all the Substories are finished now
[5:26:08] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt You will finish up the rest of the substories next chapter
[5:26:08] <%hahaha1171> yteah
[5:26:09] <xbb1024> Not sure about if your doing all the side stuff
[5:26:11] <@SSaryn> Ok like 20-30.
[5:26:11] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> yeah good estimate
[5:26:11] <%NopeBadguy> You're about halfway
[5:26:12] <%SunnyVarietyPack> maybe a little under halfway
[5:26:13] <%cvp5127> youre missing party members
[5:26:13] <%Garthunox> 25 hours
[5:26:15] <DrGasMax> You are almost done with the substories it seems if you have been doing all of them but you got a lot of PLOT PLOT PLOT PLOT PLOT left
[5:26:16] <%Cozy90> 40 hours
[5:26:17] <+GingerStrawhat> Now it's mostly plot
[5:26:18] <%radda343> TONS
[5:26:19] <1BeatGames> 100% the game!
[5:26:20] <%coreyyotto> That's about accurate
[5:26:23] <%StaceMcGate> yeah
[5:26:25] <devanmuse> assuming you don't grind out all the side quests?
[5:26:28] <%SunnyVarietyPack> yes
[5:26:28] <%Broken_Sonex> You're ALMOST half way there
[5:26:29] <+GingerStrawhat> NO like all of the substories
[5:26:30] <randomahole> gotta beat it before cyberpunk
[5:26:31] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Took me 90 hours.
[5:26:31] <@SSaryn> Pretty much, so 20-30.
[5:26:33] <+CherteuseKapibara> more characters...
[5:26:34] <GustauveVIII> cant do last racing mission until chapter 15

[5:28:41] <NitronStreams> ALL STORY ALL THE TIME
[5:28:42] <SeruraRenge> pretty much

[5:28:52] <%NopeBadguy> If you don't beat it this week, definitely next.
[5:28:57] <GustauveVIII> theres a tournament tower thats "optional" that if you dont do it, you'll probably have a bad time
[5:29:03] <%coreyyotto> Yeah I think next week is doable
[5:29:03] <%weissguard> This Chapter kinda explodes with Substories, but it dies way the f down after this.
[5:29:04] <+GingerStrawhat> You also have like a gauntlet thing coming up for grinding
[5:29:05] <%BoxNavy> hell yes
[5:29:06] <missingangle> If it's all plot, yeah, if all the streams are this long, it won't take long

[5:29:13] <%XeroSigmaPrime> WAIT CYBERPUNK IS NEXT WEEK??
[5:29:13] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> good plan
[5:29:13] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> CyborPunks
[5:29:13] <%cvp5127> what if cyberpunk is bad?
[5:29:14] <%Alazull> 5.4?
[5:29:15] <+g4mejoy> Bruh, I could hear that crunchy neck
[5:29:16] <+GingerStrawhat> I'm surprised you want to do Cyberpunk at all Pat?
[5:29:17] <%Stratiotai2> how long you think cyberpunk is gonna be
[5:29:18] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> The Power differential is massive though, so you'll need to grind out levels somewhere
[5:29:24] <%hahaha1171> such a good game
[5:29:25] <%Garthunox> you might finish it if you go for it
[5:29:26] <%BoxNavy> 0 sigh bore punks
[5:29:26] <%coreyyotto> Cyberpunk is next week, allegedly
[5:29:26] <%Daxalog> Unless Cybor sux
[5:29:30] <UlriktheSlayer1> same
[5:29:30] <DrGasMax> Bro you can't balance late game Yakuza plot and an entire extra game plot at the same time
[5:29:32] <KingVantq> it doesnt look bad
[5:29:34] <%wruce__billis> to show off the bad!
[5:29:34] <@SSaryn> Idk about that.
[5:29:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> but what if its just boring
[5:29:37] <eco419> Unless cyberpunk gets delayed
[5:29:37] <%AtlasMcCoy> Bad content is still content
[5:29:37] <+Pyroclase> TBH, the worst case with Cyberpunk is it's just fun to look at it
[5:29:39] <%toastybites> shill for us
[5:29:39] <%cvp5127> LUL
[5:29:40] <UlriktheSlayer1> i still wanna play it even if itll suck
[5:29:42] <%ShogunNoonto> just knock out yakuza
[5:29:43] <%honeyman18> that's the fun part
[5:29:45] <Ausk> oh, worm?
[5:29:58] <%Stratiotai2> itll get fucking delayed on monday
[5:30:04] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Cyberpunk is gonna top Skyrim in RPG value
[5:30:10] <+Seitine> But but Yakuza. I swear I think I’m more interested in it right now that Cyberpunk. I think I’m scared it’ll suck.
[5:30:13] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> 4D Chess
[5:30:13] <+TheNewJapanGuy> TheNewJapanGuy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! Woolie and Pat both playing Yakuza? Pretty cool.
[5:30:15] <presidentpun> Colostomy bag full of worms?
[5:30:17] <Jflaskd13> LUL
[5:30:19] <DrGasMax> Copies of Cyberpunk have already shipped on accident
[5:30:22] <%Broken_Sonex> But what if it's not bad but just boring?
[5:30:22] <eco419> LUL
[5:30:23] <%SirGO0SE> that was a good bit
[5:30:23] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Bad on Purpose
[5:30:23] <%toastybites> Detroit Emiya was a weird decision
[5:30:26] <%cvp5127> tan ppl exist in japan
[5:30:28] <+Seitine> He does. LUL
[5:30:28] <OneThousandTomatoes> i got added
[5:30:29] <%miguelrod777> oh right demiya
[5:30:31] <Remedy020> Shiro emeya? LUL
[5:30:32] <%Meidolaon> Oh yeah Woolie's totally right about EMIYA Alter
[5:30:34] <%Nysamurai> oh i suggest you hit that grinding dungeon easy over a mil exp.
[5:30:36] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I thought it was funny, but i don't care about fate
[5:30:37] <%miguelrod777> No he mean demiya
[5:30:39] <%Daxalog> Do you still play Runeterra?
[5:30:41] <mortificent> yeyeyeyeye Detroit Emiya is so fuckes
[5:30:43] <+Seitine> And sometimes he is evvvvveeeennnnn blacker. LUL
[5:30:44] <Remedy020> Unlimited blade works lol
[5:30:47] <NitronStreams> Remember Pat SAVED Yakuza Kappa
[5:30:54] <KingVantq> I just wanna see if the Character creator stuff is real LUL
[5:30:57] <@SoFarFetched> yes
[5:30:57] <presidentpun> Black people only exist in your imagination
[5:31:00] <@SoFarFetched> possibly
[5:31:01] <%wheelchairman91> yay he thanked me, day made
[5:31:02] <Meriokingston> yes
[5:31:02] <%wheelchairman91> i'm out
[5:31:03] <DrGasMax> Best Buy accident shipped Collectors Editions early, it is the reason CD Projekt Red made that statement today on streaming
[5:31:06] <%wheelchairman91> night folks
[5:31:07] <@SSaryn> I feel like this question gets asked to at least one person every stream.
[5:31:10] <devanmuse> did that guy just activate the winter soldier?
[5:31:14] <SirDogBear> yakuza 4 episode 0 was my first introduction to Yakuza series too PogChamp
[5:31:17] <%Nysamurai> @NitronStreams truuuuuuuue
[5:31:18] <OneThousandTomatoes> its all their retorts across the entire stream in on message
[5:31:18] <+ziggythehutt> Thank you money
[5:31:18] <%cvp5127> sure pat
[5:31:22] <%BoxNavy> what the fuck
[5:31:25] <Meriokingston> thank you money
[5:31:33] <@SSaryn> Yeah Pyre just comes down to its a Sportsball and I don't like it either.
[5:31:47] <%XeroSigmaPrime> The character creator is the best way to figure out if 2077 is good
[5:31:48] <+Pyroclase> I would love to see SDPR eat cow
[5:31:59] <Ausk> I think Pyre's the worst supergiant game gameplay wise, still good though
[5:32:00] <%Frodiddly> a mega disaster is always better than just "meh"
[5:32:02] <presidentpun> Thank you munny
[5:32:08] <%XeroSigmaPrime> If the creator is good, we know the game is gonna be good
[5:32:12] <mortificent> god I hope Cyberpunk touches on its cyperpunkish themes in a bad and tone deaf way
[5:32:37] <%sighphers> look, a cyberpunk game pushing capitalism
[5:32:39] <@SSaryn> Ehhhhhhhhhhhh depends on what you do.
[5:32:43] <@SSaryn> And yeah.
[5:32:48] <olaksi> let's all learn a big lesson from hype and then get hyped for next product anyway
[5:32:49] <Dr00_PhD> Kind of
[5:32:54] <+GingerStrawhat> Hardest boss battle baby
[5:32:55] <DrGasMax> Man people out for fucking blood praying that Cyberpunk is bad
[5:32:56] <illtima> That jump is fucking insane
[5:32:57] <%wruce__billis> 40ish
[5:32:57] <lagon137> Hear what shroud said about cyberpunk?
[5:32:57] <@SSaryn> 57-60
[5:32:57] <+GingerStrawhat> Like 50
[5:32:58] <KingVantq> i heard like 45
[5:32:59] <+GingerStrawhat> I think
[5:33:00] <+AmericanSkidd> 50
[5:33:01] <%Alazull> 40-50
[5:33:01] <illtima> Enemies go from 40 to 50
[5:33:01] <%Nysamurai> early 60
[5:33:02] <Dr00_PhD> yeah its rough
[5:33:02] <DrGasMax> it jumps from like 35 to 50
[5:33:03] <BlueTunicLink> Chapter 12 slaps your shit if you don't grind some
[5:33:03] <+FlyingRamen> 50
[5:33:03] <%NopeBadguy> You will likely end Chapter 12 around Level 50
[5:33:03] <KingVantq> dont know yet tho
[5:33:04] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Like 30 to 50
[5:33:04] <%weissguard> 50, iirc
[5:33:05] <%SunnyVarietyPack> i was 60 when i took it on
[5:33:06] <%coreyyotto> You'll want to be level 50
[5:33:06] <mortificent> 46-47 to 50
[5:33:08] <@SSaryn> Wait you said Chapter 12
[5:33:08] <%toastybites> ~50ish
[5:33:09] <illtima> the BIG boss fight is level 50
[5:33:09] <lumenglow> 40-50
[5:33:12] <@SSaryn> 45-50.
[5:33:12] <Dr00_PhD> 50
[5:33:15] <%AgniBrandt> About 50
[5:33:15] <%SunnyVarietyPack> 50ish
[5:33:17] <@Velyndra> >fat and pam
[5:33:18] <SleepyMaribo> 45-50 with some serious difficulty spike
[5:33:18] <%Stratiotai2> gotta be 69 right
[5:33:19] <%supersugoisenpai1> 45-50 depending of job level
[5:33:24] <+A0N33> It gives you a grinding spot right before that though
[5:33:27] <%AgniBrandt> Riiiiiight at a big boss fight that WILL kick your ass if you're not ready
[5:33:29] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Yea, idk why people are thinking Cyberpunk is gonna be bad. The team behind is clearly very passionate
[5:33:31] <SirDogBear> its tricky because job levels matters a lot too, but the exp items you get from substories help a lot
[5:33:31] <$OranHexthief> stick to around 45 so you dont face roll if you want that anyway pat
[5:33:37] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> 70 for Chapter 15.
[5:33:52] <%QueequegTheater> QueequegTheater subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! Yuta, go get that Oedipussy
[5:33:56] <@SoFarFetched> yes
[5:33:56] <mortificent> 48 is an alright level to tackle that chapter without oveleveling
[5:33:56] <+Pyroclase> The Roomba was amazing
[5:33:57] <@SSaryn> It was alright of what I saw
[5:33:57] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> yeah
[5:33:58] <%Garthunox> yes
[5:34:00] <%weissguard> You do it.
[5:34:01] <OneThousandTomatoes> sure
[5:34:01] <%Stratiotai2> thank you money
[5:34:04] <%Dunmarkh> Dragons
[5:34:05] <%RealThiele> ya dun did it
[5:34:06] <%SirGO0SE> yes :)
[5:34:07] <seaechiowai> VoHiYo
[5:34:07] <%Broken_Sonex> @XeroSigmaPrime We're just preparing for unexpected disappointment
[5:34:08] <$Skelemungus> you did it

[5:34:12] <olaksi> strem gud
[5:34:15] <%BoxNavy> yea

[5:34:31] <olaksi> fused to the couch
[5:34:37] <NitronStreams> Pat is currently 90% liquid
[5:34:39] <missingangle> I mean, yeah, you're playing and interacting with an audience for hours straight. it can be draining
[5:34:41] <%QueequegTheater> Chapter 2
[5:34:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> he didn't
[5:34:45] <Zbyrd0961> no

[5:34:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> CHapter 2
[5:34:54] <%SomeSageAdvice> wait what
[5:34:55] <NeroInfinite> nah he didn't.
[5:35:02] <mortificent> I want Cyberpunk to be good cause of the developers, but I want them to push capitalism super hard
[5:35:02] <%SomeSageAdvice> no majima?
[5:35:03] <%condemned_15> Chapter 2
[5:35:06] <+GingerStrawhat> He has fought Mr. Shakedown three times and won twice so far

[5:35:13] <+GingerStrawhat> He also can't dance

[5:35:23] <@SSaryn> Nah you won't. Can't till Arena.
[5:35:26] <%promessav2> woolie needs to pull some endurance streams
[5:35:28] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> psaBig psaWrong
[5:35:29] <%condemned_15> Woolie was getting super SALT at Disco
[5:35:30] <@SSaryn> Trust me.
[5:35:30] <%QueequegTheater> Grinding all that money offstream, he is
[5:35:30] <%JeanGardner99> since you get another dungeon with stupid exp loadage
[5:35:33] <Sunstalker> Don't let Paige eat sugar, Pat. D:
[5:35:34] <%QueequegTheater> Kappa
[5:35:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Woolie lost his black card on Dancing
[5:35:38] <%coreyyotto> The arena is in sotenbori
