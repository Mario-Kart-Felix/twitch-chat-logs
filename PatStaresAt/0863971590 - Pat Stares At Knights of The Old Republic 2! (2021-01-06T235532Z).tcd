[0:18:46] <%AkronymCLT> Is Woolie one of those "If I leave before it starts it's fine" type people?
[0:18:49] <%Starotter70> You get there at 7:30 ON THE DOT

[0:18:58] <ISKMogul> I can hear the "here's the thing though" on the podcast
[0:19:05] <%cache_22> Woolie's streams usually start 20-30 minutes after he announces their start time.
[0:19:05] <nivlac_555> he forgot?
[0:19:07] <+OwlLightningMage> Woolie is totally that guy LUL
[0:19:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's cuz of his threats of violence. If they aren't deleted in 12 hours he's not getting unsuspended
[0:19:07] <%dekkitout> Is that time discrepancy like a localization thing? Like Fahrenheit to Celsius
[0:19:08] <Daxalog> Oh no the busses.

[0:19:16] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 19m 27s.
[0:19:17] <T_Sasquatch> @ISKMogul LUL
[0:19:20] <Daxalog> Always account for busses being late or not showing up.
[0:19:21] <tux_3do> darth t3 is the real villain of the skywalker saga
[0:19:21] <oniwahoo> Woolie doesn't account for travel time in his plans?
[0:19:24] <dizimous> Did he dead ass leave at 7:30

[0:19:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> That's a bad
[0:19:47] <StarlitStunner> Time and direction kill the Woolie

[0:20:49] <%AncelDeLambert> If Woolie ever fucks things up and splits with Punch Mom we should NEVER let him live it down
[0:20:49] <%skyentombment> "I'm looking for a parking spot"="getting on my car"
[0:20:52] <Nootyman> Isn't that a pretty good sign Woolie's suffering from depression?

[0:21:28] <%umbypokochan> dang, i forgot i was watching live and i "paused" the stream lmao
[0:21:29] <%justcallmebobplease> I bet Woolie's mom was consistently early to appointments, and this is his generational rebound.

[0:21:43] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt So what you're saying is that it's a miracle the podcast is often just a little late?
[0:21:46] <+OwlLightningMage> FUCK WOOLIE
[0:21:46] <+mechslayer71> Fucking who?
[0:21:47] <ShichiNoBushi> I don't remember the PS2 being remarkably heavy. But I hardly ever took it around.
[0:21:50] <badbrokuma> wooooow I couldn't lol
[0:21:50] <Kino_Kurai> Some say he's still on his way
[0:21:50] <+Arnschen> Now there is a pandemic, so I don't have to be late for anything
[0:21:50] <%UncleAWOL> I would be so mad if I had to deal with that
[0:21:51] <%cache_22> You need to put a Tile on Woolie.
[0:21:51] <GarbageQueenEllie> Gotta love that self-improvement Juice

[0:22:09] <%RedMageRebel> @uncleawol thats an amazing name
[0:22:10] <DatAsuna> if the podcast is delayed by hours blame pat, if days, blame woolie
[0:22:10] <Goodvibes99508> it this the origins of scumbag wollie?
[0:22:10] <+OwlLightningMage> I CAN SEE WHY YOU SHIT ON WOOLIE ALL THE TIME
[0:22:11] <%MelBrooksKA> Rule1: Don't let Woolie buy the tickets.
[0:22:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Exactly
[0:22:15] <marvel877> AND BOOKS, PAT.
[0:22:15] <%AkronymCLT> And if it was original model ps2
[0:22:16] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> 2 hours on public transit? Fucking kill me.
[0:22:17] <+OwlLightningMage> HE DESERVES IT
[0:22:17] <pjbuster> dang pat
[0:22:17] <KeiPrime> launch ps2 is pretty big
[0:22:18] <+MrAtheGreat> ... Is pat getting revenge on woolie for being late to the podcasts?
[0:22:18] <%topendbuzza> og ps2 was a fat boi
[0:22:18] <brachydios777> Series S is heavier than it looks
[0:22:19] <%Ranryu692> LUL
[0:22:19] <%solracc25> Fat ps2 is heavy

[0:22:21] <%Kitafin> added weight is added weight
[0:22:22] <+Arnschen> And it's not like the teacher will use the book in class anyway
[0:22:24] <%SirGO0SE> psaDab sup gang
[0:22:25] <%MelBrooksKA> Rule 2: Do let Woolie introduce you to a girl
[0:22:25] <+mechslayer71> 2 hours? DansGame DansGame DansGame
[0:22:26] <%PaladinDupre> Imagine actually reading your text books
[0:22:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I lugged around a fat ps3 to my friend's place. It was worth it
[0:22:29] <%RedMageRebel> also since moving to a legal state I just take edibles to get to bed, fucking insomnia won't let me any other way
[0:22:31] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Ah, i have a friend who is my Woolie, guy will make plans then not show up until 8 pm while being asked every hour from 2 pm when they meant to drop by, cus i've been waiting
[0:22:32] <+PleasantLee> skipping class to play 3rd strike paid off in the end

[0:23:22] <+gaemjurnalist> reading textbooks is for nerdssss
[0:23:22] <%TheMattman1313> Is the movies thing one of the reasons y'all always tried to have the podcast at his place?
[0:23:26] <penitentpendant> People have made a manga with that title, unsurprisingly
[0:23:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> I always try to read through the textbook, but run out of steam like halfway through and just bs with class notes

[0:44:19] <%saadi90> Redheads can’t be Star Wars
[0:44:20] <%Imn0tacop> u just scrolled past a red head?.....
[0:44:20] <Pookiedaexzile> All Redheads in starwars are evil
[0:44:20] <Nootyman> It's a PS game, the colors are off, the brown hair is red
[0:44:21] <+pectusumbra> gingers extinct in the star wars timeline, a middle finger to Heinlein
[0:44:22] <+D00msDayDan> george lucas hates gingers confirmed
[0:44:22] <leinadtonu> Maybe you need a soul to use the force?
[0:44:22] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt They have no souls so they can't use the force
[0:44:24] <+BisoromiBear> gingers can't feel the force
[0:44:24] <+libra_zero> which is funny since redheads DID show up after this game
[0:44:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Reminder that as a lady MC in this game you get the first lesbian in Star Wars with Atris.
[0:44:24] <whirly25> unless you have a savage underbite like cal
[0:44:25] <@SoFarFetched> you should totally have paige do your stats
[0:44:26] <%AncelDeLambert> strength is for meatheads
[0:44:28] <%PigGuy800> that looks like mila jokavic
[0:44:28] <brachydios777> That’s why Cal Kestis is great
[0:44:28] <%TinyLittleDancer> ginger genocide
[0:44:29] <zhenthrim213> Gingers have no soul thus cant use the force
[0:44:29] <%CasualSleepyGamer> That's illegal
[0:44:30] <%0dokuro> You dont got red hair, but you got red skin
[0:44:31] <Tampaoster> There's the mandalorian ginger one
[0:44:31] <%dekkitout> Mara Jade tho
[0:44:32] <%AzureGale> HIGHWAY TO THE DANGER ZONE

[0:44:34] <%AncelDeLambert> Fuck strength, full Wisdom
[0:44:34] <T_Sasquatch> These faces are oof

[0:45:11] <KeiPrime> bo katan is also a smelly mandalorian too
[0:45:12] <%Sausious> don't you need sneak for like ONE thing

[0:53:04] <Wyldesquirrel> Ambiance is loud compared to rest of game
[0:53:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> It sounds like Space Construction Mafia

[0:53:22] <+cdrom321> Yeah. Sound effects could stand to be lower for this game.
[0:53:22] <penitentpendant> You are fine, SFX were a little loud
[0:53:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Nootyman I read that as Sex Noises. Damn my Sexlexia!
[0:53:23] <CuttleCrow> fx by like 10%
[0:53:25] <%SomeSageAdvice> yeah music seems to be fine, same for voice but sound effects are vicious
[0:53:26] <heartlesshealer> It's only the machine noises from that area

[0:55:58] <%UncleAWOL> I'd eat that wall
[0:55:58] <Nootyman> Pat, I'm trying to slice, but the SFX of my beeps keeps alerting the chat
[0:56:03] <%SomeSageAdvice> i like that wall, that is a nice wall
[0:56:04] <%CapnClassix> I can practically TASTE it
[0:56:04] <%AncelDeLambert> @SSaryn do you have something you need to tell us?
[0:56:08] <fuji_92> lickable? I wouldn't lick a wall
[0:56:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ya know, I always wondered where the Refresher/bathroom was on this ship. Is it in the walls?

[0:56:26] <Nootyman> please don't lick a wall and especially door handles
[0:56:26] <@SSaryn> @anceldelambert Listen. You gotta lick some walla when you wanna see how pretty things are.
[0:56:32] <%wibbwobbler> are these god rays?
[0:56:35] <subjectg> @garbagequeenellie you mean you don’t pee out a vent into space?
[0:56:38] <%Visorak6> that is not great
[0:56:42] <%NovaKnightmare> WHO PUT MINES ON IT
[0:56:43] <TourettesPlays> sure looks like 2005
[0:56:46] <%AncelDeLambert> @SSaryn but does it taste like schnozzberries?
[0:56:47] <%Starotter70> ah
[0:56:48] <Nootyman> RTX 2080, everyone
[0:56:53] <1matheuw> oof a chunk is missing
[0:56:54] <kickitnlickit> Look at this ray tracing
[0:56:56] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Looks like that planet had some chili
[0:56:58] <kipperxl> I've never played this game before, i am excite to see it
[0:56:59] <%0dokuro> @PatStaresAt not to backseat, but bashing open things in this game breaks items pretty often unlike kotor 1.
[0:56:59] <%Monkeyweed21> that astroid belt is a 2d jpeg
[0:57:03] <Maleicus> i put mines on it
[0:57:03] <@SSaryn> And the Raspberries taste like Raspberries.
[0:57:04] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Vanilla Space sure has some Polygons
[0:57:04] <%dekkitout> tajRLY
[0:57:06] <creepywoody> Its not that bad
[0:57:08] <+Arnschen> Sharp
[0:57:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> @subjectg I mean, I assume not. There's gotta be a sink or shower somewhere.
[0:57:13] <%TinyLittleDancer> Is this cyberpunk?
[0:57:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> iits fine honestly
[0:57:14] <%miabyte> Now This is RAY TRACING!

[0:57:23] <ToneBacas> thread the needle
[0:57:23] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 57m 34s.
[0:57:23] <%AncelDeLambert> ROLL D20!
[0:57:24] <+SmokyProgg> that looks fine honestly
[0:57:26] <karovus> who put those there??
[0:57:27] <%NeoCre> I’ve seen FAR worse
[0:57:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> Well. Was NOT expecting Pat to play this.
[0:57:33] <%Mr_Pylon> isn't there a mine xp cheese here?
[0:57:33] <thelonechris> No shit, that's what mines do
[0:57:34] <falikk> this game is sex
[0:57:34] <Siconia> 2005 was one hell of a year
[0:57:36] <%0dokuro> This is fine, I dont see the problem
[0:57:38] <Nootyman> These aren't the Rays you're looking for
[0:57:40] <%seedleash> I don't like the way the game looks please
[0:57:45] <%cervidaequus> This lady is so fuckin loud
[0:57:45] <%AncelDeLambert> I like keeping things
[0:57:48] <Laecerelius> Get that infinite exp!
[0:57:51] <CSeriesJTYPE> so nihilus is the single most powerful being in the history of star wars, right
[0:57:51] <Badgerconda_> Wait a minute, YOU'RE NOT WOOLIE!
[0:57:52] <tanarath> Pat, show off the mine exploit!
[0:57:53] <scrublordsamurai> are you going dark or light?
[0:57:55] <%flagi64> take mine, get xp
[0:57:57] <heartlesshealer> So infinite grinding point =)
[0:57:58] <%0dokuro> Gold era of star wars games
[0:58:04] <deuxexgodzilla> Whelp we shed about 150 kilos on this here rig, we can save about 7 lightyears to the kg.
[0:58:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> tip: always recover mines to sell them for Hella Cash
[0:58:09] <%seedleash> some said you couldn't stretch a texture that far...
[0:58:10] <+Jaromero435> T3 is my best friend
[0:58:17] <ShichiNoBushi> ...or sell for money.
[0:58:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oh man I can feel the texture mods from here
[0:58:27] <heartlesshealer> but of course infinite grinding is not an exciting stream, so Pat will probably get to the writing
[0:58:27] <%AncelDeLambert> T3 is the goodest boy and we should all tell him how nice he looks in the sweater his mommy bought him!
[0:58:30] <subjectg> really the real reasons to recover em is for the exp
[0:58:34] <chicken_apostle> take damage it'll be funny
[0:58:48] <%0dokuro> Xp is the big reason to recover mine ya
[0:58:48] <+OwlLightningMage> This game needs more Jar Jar
[0:58:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> @AncelDeLambert Lest he zap us.
[0:58:52] <%Ipsenscastle> Oh man I missed the start, I was watching the DMC3 speedrun
[0:58:52] <+MushyCornbread> precious exp

[0:59:02] <deuxexgodzilla> Fun fact: never mistake Mines for Mime, I did that once. . . . ONCE. . .
[0:59:02] <scrublordsamurai> darth t3 is a good boy
[0:59:03] <KaiserMario> T3 is way worse than T2 but still better than Salvation
[0:59:04] <%AncelDeLambert> Why the HELL would you farm experience from the opening tutorial when you can just CHEAT?
[0:59:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'm hoping that either Pat chooses Handmaiden or keeps Disciple around to abuse him.
[0:59:12] <kipperxl> is this a pod race?
[0:59:16] <%SolidusRex> SolidusRex subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! Time for the purest of pazaak. By the way, have you heard of a show called Infinity Train? You might like it Pat, it's a show where cool things happen to people who get big, big number
[0:59:21] <falikk> if you want cash just strip your maiden continuously and sell her clothes
[0:59:28] <%Ipsenscastle> A DMC pin I made is one of the AGDQ prizes at the moment, I'm so hyped
[0:59:43] <@SSaryn> @ipsenscastle Eyyyy nice
[0:59:45] <%0dokuro> @AncelDeLambert Pat Gremlin do what Pat Gremlin want
[0:59:48] <ShichiNoBushi> Gameplay-wise, it makes sense that Bashing damages contents but opens the inventory for free while using a mine to open it leaves them intact. Realistically, though...
[0:59:48] <$RealThiele> LUL salvation og ending john is a terminator
[0:59:49] <+PenmanLupine> T3 is the best of the modern Terminator movies and thats.....pretty terrible
[0:59:51] <Profmcstevie> For real Ipsen? rad
[0:59:52] <MyNameIsRasus> @falikk don't threaten me with a good time

[1:00:21] <T_Sasquatch> my desktop is WILD
[1:00:22] <DatAsuna> @AncelDeLambert When woolie let me edit his save for influence points, I actually tried to cheat T3 into the sith assassin prestige class but it didn't take.
[1:00:23] <Siconia> No door can stop pat
[1:00:28] <MyNameIsRasus> no

[1:00:35] <%Mr_Pylon> barely
[1:00:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Maleicus I had thought the restored content allowed recruiting HD as a female. Perhaps I'm wrong.
[1:00:36] <%king_wragles> The game is kinda loud actually, that's just me tho
[1:00:36] <%Ipsenscastle> @DeadManProp thank you! :D
[1:00:37] <%furiousfurioso> no
[1:00:37] <MonsieurHonHon> we can hear ya
[1:00:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> Yeah, it's a bit louder than the rest of the bad though
[1:00:38] <%VoidBaronJules> sfx are to loud
[1:00:40] <%AncelDeLambert> @DatAsuna booooooo
[1:00:40] <heartlesshealer> I can hear, but it's hard
[1:00:40] <%SirGO0SE> can hear you but the sfx is for sure too loud
[1:00:42] <falikk> barley
[1:00:42] <$RealThiele> bzzzrt
[1:00:44] <%Mr_Pylon> fine
[1:00:44] <kipperxl> we all saw pats weird text adventure porn games
[1:00:45] <%Wurmspawn> Yes, but it's not a great balance. The game is loud.
[1:00:47] <CuttleCrow> SFX are loud
[1:00:47] <%VoidBaronJules> yeah
[1:00:47] <deuxexgodzilla> yes
[1:00:48] <MonsieurHonHon> its good
[1:00:48] <%0dokuro> @HefestoForges Ya he's going full sith

[1:00:51] <%NeoCre> Yes
[1:00:52] <Coystick> Who's talking???
[1:00:52] <%HefestoForges> far from it is fine
[1:00:52] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Sound effects are whats loud
[1:00:53] <%baka_sugoi> okay
[1:00:53] <penitentpendant> Everywhere but not next to the SFX is fine
[1:00:54] <%Wurmspawn> Voice is a bit loud too.
[1:00:54] <%Mr_Pylon> SFs are out of control
[1:00:55] <%king_wragles> I can barely hear you over the narrator
[1:00:56] <fuji_92> yes we hear you, it's just the sfx
[1:00:57] <$spardanwarrior> Everywhere else yes
[1:01:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> The crackling is loud, rest is good to me
[1:01:02] <$RealThiele> mostly ok
[1:01:04] <+xlxviciousxlx> I think the audio is Fine
[1:01:05] <+OwlLightningMage> Who said that

[1:01:06] <deuxexgodzilla> half'll be good
[1:01:06] <jackeroff3> I'm good
[1:01:08] <%Ranryu692> I think you're low today, Pat. I've had my volume turned up way higher than usual
[1:01:09] <heartlesshealer> everywhere that's not near a BROKEN SHIP PIECE is fine
[1:01:10] <ShichiNoBushi> As mentioned in Woolie's playthrough, mines that you have placed to open doors and boxes will not harm you and you don't need to move away from them.
[1:01:12] <jackeroff3> Audio is good
[1:01:13] <%baka_sugoi> better
[1:01:13] <deuxexgodzilla> Better
[1:01:14] <AdmiralButtloaf> better
[1:01:15] <Maleicus> @GarbageQueenEllie you are wrong, there is however a separate mod to get both
[1:01:15] <CuttleCrow> 👍

[1:03:20] <AMUSERNAME> KOTOR 2 SUPER loud SFX, MUSIC, but quiet dialog.

[1:08:54] <+DemonOfSalt> If I meditate hard enough, will my breasts be removed from my body? I feel like that's the implication of what you are saying Pat.
[1:09:00] <chicken_apostle> Use the old lady as armor

[1:09:06] <+MushyCornbread> yay you opened a door to another door

[1:20:46] <%Wurmspawn> You know, the only thing about Kotor that I'm really bothered by is how there is virtually no technological difference between the movies are and the old republic era. I believe that's not how it was in the original comics, but the only real differences for the games in how things look, but all the tech is still the same thousands of years before the movies.

[1:24:47] <%ssjklyco> Her tatas
[1:24:49] <%BigCoffee> Pat, might you be able to shrink your camera just a bit, cause we can't read what's happening for the choices.

[1:24:49] <sponsoredviewer910> dat stance tho

[1:25:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Please keep in mind in the game that negative influence and positive influence BOTH unlock new conversation options. A companion that hates you has the same options as one who loves you.
[1:25:23] <+BubbaRands> tfw no big tiddy force gf...
[1:25:23] <ringowoo> I love the small text. I can almost not read it.

[1:25:32] <scrublordsamurai> darth karen will see the galaxies manager OR ELSE!
[1:25:33] <%Ner234> Pat will NEVER adjust his layout for the bottom left.
[1:25:33] <%PaladinDupre> its Blank Paige cause shes plain white
[1:25:37] <Nootyman> it's not mommy milk anymore, it's grandma's cheese
[1:25:41] <%a_goth_pancake> pat, how could you mod the game and not mod in a red head?
[1:25:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> So you can be a total asshole and still get new content.

[1:29:59] <+reallybigrocks> From where I'm sitting you're only like 6 inches tall Pat
[1:30:06] <Nootyman> pressing the right analog stick works for twirling for some people
[1:30:08] <causewaybob> Darth orb
[1:30:09] <%QueequegTheater> So three streams from now
[1:30:11] <Nootyman> on xbox controller
[1:30:11] <jackeroff3> grandma died. Now she goes the way of the potato, deep down in the earth
[1:30:20] <%PaladinDupre> Peragus more like Pergatory
[1:30:25] <LoudmicRPG> @PatStaresAt are ya gonna do a whole playthrough or just dipping in?
[1:30:38] <%a_goth_pancake> from my point of view it is the pat who is too loud.
[1:30:41] <%Wurmspawn> Pat these games were made when playing one application at a time was ALL a computer could do. Nowadays we fight with computer apps to make sure it doesn't try to take over the computer. But back then, that wasn't an option.
[1:30:59] <Daxalog> Dosnt influence only come into play later?
[1:31:05] <%dekkitout> Ah the potato, the one root vegetable that knows how to exist independent of the force
[1:31:09] <%QueequegTheater> I have too much empathy for characters
[1:31:14] <Grandma_Amari> @ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter Hey she WILL Speak to the manager if you don't respect her expired personal shield generator coupon.
[1:31:21] <%0dokuro> influence can impact a lot of stuff early
[1:31:24] <LoudmicRPG> @PatStaresAt are ya gonna do a whole playthrough or just dipping in for a bit? IT would be fun to see you play the whole game, its just so good
[1:31:24] <DatAsuna> If you're doing the opposite of woolie, don't do any crimes on citadel station or kill that guy on nar shaddaa
[1:31:26] <+Nymphonomicon> Are you going to do the Speeder Bike fix exploit? @PatStaresAt
[1:31:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> I used to feel guilty about Player Character superdickery, but now I love it
[1:31:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Glad you aren't going to fall into the Woolie trap of making every companion like you regardless of alignment.
[1:31:30] <+OwlLightningMage> Dragon Age One had that for some characters too
[1:31:32] <asylumkon> you only have to worry about it untill you have atton and kriea in your party
[1:31:34] <heartlesshealer> it affects things very early
[1:31:34] <+tyrianfolly> we had realplayer
[1:31:35] <%Monkeyweed21> 2021 needs like a 6 month delay
[1:31:39] <%QueequegTheater> You can make your first Jedi before Nar Shaddaa is over
[1:31:40] <DatAsuna> You can easily save edit influence too
[1:31:42] <Grandma_Amari> Sounds like Pat's going the 'Dark Side Now' route compared to Woolie's 'Light Side Later' route Kappa
[1:31:49] <heartlesshealer> =p
[1:31:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> NOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:31:52] <%0dokuro> Hard dark side or hard light side will see the most drastic changes though
[1:31:54] <+SinisterBroccoli> bao is the hardest to turn dark
[1:31:56] <Pookiedaexzile> DO IT
[1:31:58] <%dekkitout> Antagonize the shit out of Aton, make dat bitch squirm
[1:31:59] <Pookiedaexzile> MAKE THEM EVIL
[1:32:03] <%0dokuro> DO IT
[1:32:04] <%Starotter70> DO IT
[1:32:04] <%TinyLittleDancer> Phrasing
[1:32:04] <Pookiedaexzile> YEs
[1:32:04] <Paciboyy> There's a really fun event if you have low influence with atton but high with disciple
[1:32:04] <%Agami23> corrupt them all pat
[1:32:07] <Pookiedaexzile> YESS
[1:32:07] <%bigbrothergannon> !uptime

[1:32:08] <%Wallabri> (palpatine voice) DO IT
[1:32:09] <ner0romanov> @PatStaresAt Which Kotor do you like more?
[1:32:11] <%baka_sugoi> THE DARCK SIDE HAS OREO COOKIES
[1:32:11] <DatAsuna> @PatStaresAt you do know making them hate you also passes the influence checks too? It's basically a soft version of the DA2 rivalry system
[1:32:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> I hope we get to turn Mira into an Egirl
[1:32:12] <%SirGO0SE> dew it
[1:32:13] <%PaladinDupre> CORRRUPT
[1:32:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I mean that happens if they hate you too.
[1:32:16] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt "Pat reveals his corruption fetish live on stream"
[1:32:16] <KynnRedgrave> pat do you have the mod that lets you pick between mira and the wookie on nar shaada?
[1:32:19] <%0dokuro> Easy
[1:32:21] <Pookiedaexzile> dew it
[1:32:22] <Twiton> Influence is introduced on the Harbinger, you'll know when
[1:32:22] <DatAsuna> default influence is 50, not0
[1:32:23] <rosemon5001> ohh no was the woolie hole the pat hole all along?!?!?! @PatStaresAt
[1:32:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It can be fun to be a jerk, but I tend to get too empathetic for the poor bits of code so I don't usually :)
[1:32:24] <fuji_92> yeah, fuck that, it's cool when your party likes u
[1:32:24] <Maleicus> i mean you miss out on dialogue if you dont get people to like you
[1:32:25] <%DeadManProp> yyjPuke yyjPuke
[1:32:25] <%Monkeyweed21> Will you be choosing certain light side options just to spite Woolie and his Light Later stuff @PatStaresAt ?
[1:32:28] <ner0romanov> Kreia is such a great character
[1:32:30] <Grandma_Amari> Tease Aton's dick to make him evil, never put out Kappa
[1:32:30] <%Aydarkzero> cool wallpaper

[1:32:31] <%chiazam> become as evil

[1:32:48] <%Monkeyweed21> DARK SIDE LATER
[1:32:48] <DatAsuna> So you're repeating woolie options then

[1:33:06] <heartlesshealer> Getting full red party is always fun, even if you don't get the greatest story feel
[1:33:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kotor 2 is the height of star wars in a narrative sense in my opinion
[1:33:07] <%spokensun> OFWG

[1:33:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Impatience.
[1:33:39] <%a_goth_pancake> the writing quality in this game is so much higher than the first. listening to Attons backstory is better than any companion quest from one in my opinion.

[1:33:58] <%Ipsenscastle> Remember when Woolie made Carth kill his own son while naked?
[1:33:58] <Pookiedaexzile> You thought that other shit was dark

[1:34:09] <+Nymphonomicon> If only dual-wielding was better in this game.
[1:34:12] <+OwlLightningMage> DON'T USE A VIBRO CUTTER
[1:34:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kae'Ryn Drippo is far too powerful to be contained by your petty sense of morality
[1:34:14] <Dave_VD> Has anyone told Pat that there are Vibroblades in the Mandalorian?

[1:35:41] <dinnydanny777> When she stands still with the gun she has a mega Karen pose LUL
[1:35:41] <CrimsonFox777> Would a Karen use a gun? I feel that they would be super anti-gun, because of the children.

[1:35:59] <+SinisterBroccoli> are you gonna do sith assassin?
[1:36:01] <+Nymphonomicon> Paige is literally your better half. @PatStaresAt
[1:36:03] <%0dokuro> Honestly that Dark side blaster is amazing
[1:36:03] <Grandma_Amari> Gun Jedi is actually totally viable and great, just to make the saber fetishists suffer.
[1:36:03] <ape_hawk> Is that a Karen? She has a gun!
[1:36:04] <El_GhostV1> Gun twirl?

[1:36:17] <KaiserMario> Can you twirl gun just like Ocelot?
[1:36:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> @PatStaresAt You HAVE to give Kae'Ryn Force Scream. It is so on brand.
[1:36:19] <+megaman_sentinel> unlimited power Karen must have it

[1:36:28] <+OwlLightningMage> High Paige is too powerful for her own good
[1:36:29] <+punchdrunk_donkeybooy> Would a Space Karen wear Sith Robes or a Spandex suit?
[1:36:30] <+BubbaRands> Kae'Ryn would like to speak with Darth Maen-Nejar
[1:36:31] <subjectg> Dual Mandalorian Disintegrators is the shit

[1:37:08] <%TIME_PUNCHER> TIME_PUNCHER subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! Here today we see KOTOR 2 in our New Zealand. Does this mean for the same as the power of attorney? If Kae-Ryn a Jedi? Yes. But Sith is the only one who gives the good cutlery. Word, bitches.
[1:37:12] <%Ascethetic> @patstaresat you think youre gonna have Woolie luck and get an endgame item early?
[1:37:14] <KaiserMario> Saber on right hand and blaster on left is the true Jedi path
[1:37:17] <brunoberserk> gonna be a dark side run or light side run ?
[1:37:19] <fuji_92> we going dex/str melee or mage

[1:37:59] <DatAsuna> mobile also has controller support
[1:38:00] <Twiton> Blaster only becomes fantastic against late-game saber enemies
[1:38:01] <rindoesstuffnthings> what is that buzzing
[1:38:03] <Psyramics> only issue is the text size is soooo small

[1:39:12] <%TinyLittleDancer> A lot of these older games have separate UI layers that don't scale well with HiDPI screens. You could always render the whole game at a lower supported resolution, but then sad graphics

[1:39:50] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt I checked when I played last. You can modify the text, but it breaks how the menu displays the font. A resolution patch if not already applied might make the text more bearable.

[1:43:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YOU DIDNT KNOW?
[1:43:07] <+OwlLightningMage> You didn't know that LUL
[1:43:07] <%Deadpal> it depends on who it is
[1:43:08] <Nootyman> yeah, Every ACTION provokes an equal REACTION
[1:43:09] <Zombrocom> Yeah, negative influence
[1:43:10] <DatAsuna> Their CLASS is still jedi, but they say dark jedi shit
[1:43:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> Interesting, I had no clue
[1:43:10] <HotMafia81> Jedi Asshole Skwad, whaddup
[1:43:10] <9BallSeraph> Console commands tho
[1:43:10] <Grandma_Amari> You can make them Sith equivelants
[1:43:11] <Nootyman> LAW OF THE UNIVERSE
[1:43:11] <KaiserMario> Ye

[1:43:13] <+BubbaRands> CAUSE THEY HATE YOU HARD ENOUGHT
[1:43:13] <Sokumotanaka> Or was it hanhar?
[1:43:13] <%dekkitout> Reach out. Feel it.
[1:43:14] <heartlesshealer> =)
[1:43:16] <%CatastropheCorvid> When influence is so strongly opposed that they hate you, they'll go light side if you're dark
[1:43:17] <+Nymphonomicon> Pat learns his purpose in life.
[1:43:17] <HealingMind> You become a Jedi Vampire when you're evil?
[1:43:18] <Djinnazz> SITH
[1:43:18] <thelonechris> Reverse psychology
[1:43:19] <$realm_forge> Subscribe for force powers lol
[1:43:21] <asylumkon> you have dark side speeches when you do it
[1:43:21] <tanarath> NO IT ISN'T, READ THE GUIDES NERD
[1:43:23] <%SolidusRex> I've listened to CSB long enough to become the purest and most radiant of Jedi
[1:43:24] <+tyrianfolly> BECOME A JEDI OUT OF SPITE
[1:43:24] <%wibbwobbler> hmm
[1:43:24] <%Sausious> you can make people be light side because they HATE YOU
[1:43:27] <%0dokuro> @PatStaresAt Are you just interested in graphical mods? Changing the text size has been explained by modders already to be pretty impractical cause it causes dialogue problems apparently.
[1:43:27] <TrollKing96> These logs are giving me some lite System Shock 2 vibes.
[1:43:28] <%NeoCre> Yeah, you can turn them into sith
[1:43:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NO PAT SITHS
[1:43:31] <%Deadpal> @Sokumotanaka you can mod hanhar to get it to do!
[1:43:34] <%ssjklyco> Put that in the current Star wars medias
[1:43:36] <kipperxl> crazy talk them into jediism
[1:43:37] <%Ranryu692> yeah, strong emotions lead to the Dark Side lol
[1:43:39] <Clundy> Revenge Jesus
[1:43:39] <%dekkitout> Wake up to justice
[1:43:39] <Sokumotanaka> @PatStaresAt Except the wookie sadly cause lucus is a dick
[1:43:39] <%NeoCre> SITH
[1:43:41] <+Silv3rS0und> Pettiness is the path to strength
[1:43:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt That's what I was getting at.
[1:43:44] <Clundy> Jedis*
[1:43:46] <HotMafia81> Everybody can be Jedi, but you have to be special to be a big asshole.
[1:43:48] <DatAsuna> dark jedi /=/ sith
[1:43:49] <Sokumotanaka> @Deadpal Real shit?
[1:43:51] <fuji_92> SITH GANG
[1:43:53] <Grandma_Amari> They're influenced directly by your character, so if you're an asshole, they BECOME an asshole.
[1:43:54] <%NeoCre> YOU TURN THEM INTO SITH PAT
[1:43:55] <+MushyCornbread> just roll
[1:43:56] <%Deadpal> yeah
[1:43:57] <Dave_VD> Can you make Mira a sith?
[1:43:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can have a party full of jedi constantly trying to redeem you.
[1:43:58] <DatAsuna> no
[1:43:59] <Djinnazz> no
[1:43:59] <Daxalog> He can heal good i guess?
[1:44:00] <Grandma_Amari> You're gonna turn your followers into Karens
[1:44:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You get unique dialogue.
[1:44:04] <DatAsuna> just story
[1:44:05] <Nootyman> Newton's Third Law of Force. Every Sith has an equal and opposite reaction of a Jedi
[1:44:05] <%Deadpal> healing vs damage.
[1:44:09] <%democrazyyy> he becomes a dark jedi
[1:44:11] <%dekkitout> Asaj Ventress was a jedi who went sith who went back to jedi-ish cause of Dooku
[1:44:14] <%Nobrev> hilarity
[1:44:18] <%Deadpal> cc/healing for lightside powers
[1:44:19] <+Silv3rS0und> dialogue and light side powers
[1:44:21] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt its really funny
[1:44:24] <%NeoCre> He becomes sith
[1:44:25] <%Deadpal> MASSIVE damage for darkside and drain.
[1:44:26] <+OwlLightningMage> You can turn everyone into managers for your Karen
[1:44:28] <DatAsuna> well in cut content dark/low influence atton can kill disciple @PatStaresAt
[1:44:31] <%twistedj3ster> Pat how do you need a guide to be an asshole...
[1:44:34] <%Deadpal> yeah
[1:44:36] <Daxalog> How do you make T3 hate you?
[1:44:41] <asylumkon> thats why everyone wants dark later to turn mira to the dark side
[1:44:41] <+cdrom321> To be clear, the Jedi classes you make them are not light/dark.
[1:44:42] <%0dokuro> Different abilities based on class.
[1:44:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah it gives you different dialogue and cutscenes.
[1:44:44] <%Deadpal> some conversations have 0 influence on lightside/darkside
[1:44:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Darth T3 tho
[1:44:48] <%honeyman18> Atton Darkside rulez
[1:44:49] <%Deadpal> but does change influences
[1:44:53] <%democrazyyy> if you are dark side and get positive influence for a light side choice, it makes them evil @patstaresat
[1:44:56] <HotMafia81> Bao-Dur the softest boi
[1:44:57] <austinj24> "Bowdur"
[1:44:58] <%0dokuro> Like how you start with different stuff depending on your choice of class.
[1:44:59] <%Deadpal> yeaaaaaaaaaaah
[1:45:00] <Nootyman> So long, Gay Bowder
[1:45:02] <DatAsuna> You could use a mod to have both handmaiden and disciple
[1:45:02] <+SolidusRex> Pat, it's Star Wars
[1:45:04] <%Deadpal> that's the number one complaint with it
[1:45:07] <%BigCoffee> star wars is fucking binary
[1:45:10] <%Deadpal> that's
[1:45:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> Gender-Neutral Jedi
[1:45:11] <+OwlLightningMage> MORE BINARY
[1:45:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> So does Kreia, and look where that got her
[1:45:13] <avkid_> holy shit twitch is fucked. thanks for streaming pat, glad to be here.
[1:45:18] <%wibbwobbler> thats bioware honestly
[1:45:22] <%chiazam> Pat why didn't you look at these guides earlier lmfao
[1:45:26] <%dekkitout> Probably not
[1:45:32] <%Nobrev> desktop porn exposed
[1:45:32] <%linSP> some ign guides are legit
[1:45:33] <Nootyman> Star Wars is binary UNLESS WE TALK ABOUT THE GREY JEDI
[1:45:34] <+megaman_sentinel> lol
[1:45:35] <+Fapbsi> I missed the start of the stream, can someone please share with me what path I can expect? Like, is pat gonna be full dark from the start orrr is he going without a certain focus on a specific side? (btw no matter what, I am really looking forward to this, hope you have fun pat!)
[1:45:39] <+OwlLightningMage> Why didn't you look at this earlier LUL
[1:45:40] <%a_goth_pancake> oh God, Pat's going to get boring toast man instead of handmaiden, isn't he? or is this the good mod that erases him from the game?
[1:45:41] <Grandma_Amari> I wish we got a real sequel that had Grey Jedi as an actual option. You could do it in KOTOR 1/2 but you actively fucked yourself out of the light/dark side bonuses.
[1:45:41] <%wibbwobbler> oops nvm lol
[1:45:41] <jhamez_94> If you have high enough influence with a companion, they will turn into a jedi based on YOUR alignment
[1:45:43] <%NopeBadguy> strategywiki is the one i used for my playthrough
[1:45:48] <Twiton> You can mod in Handmaiden choice
[1:45:49] <%Deadpal> right so the CANON ending is neither darkside OR lightside for this game.
[1:45:51] <+aversal_ammar> There’s not many good guides
[1:45:58] <%Deadpal> but they still base bonuses off of lightside and darkside shit.
[1:46:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Fapbsi He's playing as Darth Kae'Ryn :)
[1:46:01] <%Sausious> @PatStaresAt the more influence you have with a char, the more they go to YOUR alignment, the more they hate youe the more they go AWAY
[1:46:04] <%dekkitout> Star Wars is as binary as one's knowledge- in and out of narrative
[1:46:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Low enough influence and they turn into a jedi based on the opposite alignment.
[1:46:10] <%chiazam> uh huhhhh
[1:46:15] <%democrazyyy> they move to match your alignment, so you take a small alignment hit yourself to move them to one side or the other @patstaresat
[1:46:16] <+Over_ninek> hello is this stream about the best Star Wars character, Kreia?
[1:46:20] <HealingMind> Is this actually canon, or is this a Star Wars Legend?
[1:46:22] <whirly25> is that mr krabs
[1:46:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Deadpal That's not true, the canon ending is light but not pure light.
[1:46:24] <+shry7> @Fapbsi full dark side
[1:46:32] <+Fapbsi> @Valentinius_Anodyne ty!
[1:46:40] <Psyramics> @HealingMind legend
[1:46:42] <%Sausious> basically
[1:46:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt This is how the devil works.
[1:46:46] <+Fapbsi> well this is gonna be fun :D
[1:46:46] <Grandma_Amari> Also their looks change. Bao-Dur starts looking like fucking Maul
[1:46:47] <s1rcuit> I'm confused
[1:46:47] <%a_goth_pancake> @healingmind legends
[1:46:48] <%democrazyyy> and he'll be super down with murder
[1:46:53] <%dekkitout> This is very not canon, until Dave Filoni says otherwise
[1:46:55] <%honeyman18> Make them love you, it's more content
[1:46:55] <%Nobrev> @HealingMind I think KOTOR is currently in a weird half canon half legends state
[1:46:56] <Twiton> There's a mod that seemlessly allows you to choose when you meet either of the Gender locked ones
[1:46:56] <%NopeBadguy> basically high influence matches your alignment, low influence opposes your alignment
[1:46:59] <%shurtal> i never really sunk my teeth into this one, is there a Carth?
[1:47:03] <+OwlLightningMage> The Clemps locker
[1:47:09] <%0dokuro> Ya, but this is Pat lore, not Star Wars lore
[1:47:12] <+soflicar> good now evil later?
[1:47:16] <HealingMind> Alright, thanks guys!
[1:47:18] <%Sausious> @shurtal there's a Carth that's actually cool
[1:47:23] <%democrazyyy> making bao dur a dark jedi guardian out of his hatred for mandalorians is super difficult but satisfying
[1:47:26] <%a_goth_pancake> carth yes, if you didn't kill him in the last game
[1:47:29] <%Deadpal> @Too_Much_Nukie Well not ENTIRELY gray but it's not "pure light" to find out the true backstory on a lot of stuff
[1:47:33] <+Silv3rS0und> @dekkitout you mean until Dave Filoni makes it canon, but with a dumb twist
[1:47:36] <Nootyman> Hurr Durr
[1:47:39] <%shurtal> @Sausious Quelle Surprise
[1:47:48] <cheapdoc> evil now eviler later
[1:48:07] <+CookieCutter007> but lives?
[1:48:13] <%0dokuro> Actually is Carth alive in this playthough lol? Guess will find out.
[1:48:14] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt heads up, cam is obstructing dialogue
[1:48:15] <ape_hawk> yes blind grandma
[1:48:19] <Badgerconda_> Has pat never played this game before?
[1:48:20] <%chiazam> So how do you sense it
[1:48:21] <ape_hawk> thank you blind grandma
[1:48:23] <%Mr_Pylon> Kreia is like a weird serious Dril sometimes
[1:48:26] <+OwlLightningMage> Rip out your eyeballs
[1:48:30] <%dekkitout> Better to have Thrawn lose to space whales than no Thrawn at all
[1:48:39] <%twistedj3ster> I mean I can't read it anyway
[1:48:40] <%Romuken> @PatStaresAt but Woolie
[1:48:43] <%cylish> We doing the echo drinking game?
[1:48:43] <%MidnightBurst12> there's the special word

[1:49:21] <jackeroff3> hope we get an heir to the empire trilogy
[1:49:22] <KeiPrime> what is she doing with her off hand
[1:49:22] <ape_hawk> god, look how dainty her hand is lol
[1:49:22] <%0dokuro> Grenade
[1:49:23] <+The_monster_hunter> just use the sword
[1:49:24] <bbblaketwitching> but lessons tho
[1:49:25] <%chiazam> PFFFFTTTT
[1:49:28] <ringowoo> She needs some glasses
[1:49:29] <$Ponch65> the blaster is bad, need to speak to its manager
[1:49:35] <+Silv3rS0und> Disagree, some things are better left cool and uncanon, than canon and uncool
[1:49:38] <%democrazyyy> LOL
[1:49:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> IS IT THO
[1:49:52] <%0dokuro> Its not the blaster, its the blaster'ee
[1:49:54] <+tyrianfolly> yes
[1:50:00] <+thegreenbenis> Darth Karen
[1:50:02] <+megaman_sentinel> they right in front of u lol
[1:50:10] <Paciboyy> echo take a shot
[1:50:11] <%democrazyyy> that moment felt so flaccid compared to woolie blowing them up and cutting instantly to this cutscene
[1:50:12] <%CarpeDeezKnuts> CarpeDeezKnuts subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! lets fucking go! best Star Wars story period
[1:50:12] <%chiazam> Yeah lets have this conversation in the middle of a fight
[1:50:28] <%Ellila> Okay. So are you turbo fucked if you level up guns and shit? Since you are gonna become a jedi I assumje
[1:50:30] <Twiton> Disciple is interesting, but I'd suggest the mod that lets you choose who to keep.
[1:50:30] <kipperxl> you, did it
[1:50:38] <%wibbwobbler> starwar can be kinda cool sometimes i guess
[1:50:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Ellila You can be a gun jedi.
[1:50:43] <%chiazam> Never
[1:50:50] <%0dokuro> Disciple is honestly pretty boring compared to everyone else.
[1:50:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> In this one you're a jedi from the start.
[1:50:54] <+thegreenbenis> Can Pat beat the entire game without putting on pants?
[1:50:55] <%NopeBadguy> stealth LUL
[1:50:55] <HealingMind> Do Jedi actually have rules against guns in any form?
[1:50:58] <+nirvana227> stealth LUL
[1:50:58] <+OwlLightningMage> Auto level is for heroes
[1:51:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> No.
[1:51:03] <subjectg> @ellila guns are actually cool in this one
[1:51:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Jedi use guns all the time.
[1:51:09] <%chiazam> oooooooooooooooh
[1:51:13] <Paciboyy> speed
[1:51:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Ellila Get Precise shot and Close combat and you're set.

[1:51:20] <+rendingmelody> Your a Jedi Harry, or a harry Jedi
[1:51:21] <%NopeBadguy> oh, so, fun trick, you can use a medkit as a free action by opening your menu and using it during a round. it's a little janky.
[1:51:22] <%chiazam> this music needs to chill

[1:54:03] <Grandma_Amari> I'm very confused what he means
[1:54:03] <%AlphaTauri> a
[1:54:05] <+gaemjurnalist> huh
[1:54:06] <+Silv3rS0und> GG
[1:54:07] <%chiazam> not so close
[1:54:11] <RandyFistburgers> peenfluence
[1:54:12] <PinkSocks> what did he mean by that
[1:54:12] <%0dokuro> They didnt deserve camera time
[1:54:14] <+OwlLightningMage> Someone translate Boivin
[1:54:15] <%SirGO0SE> cool guys dont look at explosions
[1:54:17] <Psyramics> yeah, cutscenes activating immediately is kinda bad
[1:54:18] <%chiazam> LMFAOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:54:20] <Profmcstevie> Room clear in 1 turn
[1:54:23] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Cool guys don't look at explosions
[1:54:26] <+projectmanatees> If all it fails just use console commands
[1:54:29] <kipperxl> gotta record your karen confrontations so you can upload them to the space youtube
[1:54:31] <redmoon108> 😂
[1:54:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If all else fails just use cheat engine.
[1:54:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> I always loved that part w the grenade
[1:54:48] <+bugz_munny> shock
[1:54:53] <%0dokuro> Heal, Lightning and Deflect are really good
[1:54:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can do some dumb shit in this game with cheat engine and console commands.
[1:54:59] <%wibbwobbler> did he do it?
[1:55:00] <%chiazam> Explosions just wasting enemies are always so funny in this game
[1:55:04] <+Silv3rS0und> Speed is OP
[1:55:06] <%NopeBadguy> probably better to grab lightning
[1:55:09] <notsoy> GOTTA GO FAST
[1:55:10] <Daxalog> Burst of speed seems mandatory. Since youll be doing alot of walking. Throughout the game.
[1:55:11] <+bugz_munny> fuck peragus go shock
[1:55:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> Speed or Lightning, would be good for Sith
[1:55:18] <subjectg> Everybody sleeps on energy resistance, it’s super good
[1:55:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Force shock is good against droids.
[1:55:20] <%0dokuro> Drain life is amazing
[1:55:33] <+Silv3rS0und> EEL
[1:55:34] <+projectmanatees> Explosion skipping for speed run strats
[1:55:34] <%juxtest> Force Butt
[1:55:35] <%0dokuro> Force shock is your best bet
[1:55:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I'd recommend lightning or push for early game DPS.
[1:55:38] <Serial_Gurter> So has the red man mastered the clothing only Hard diff run?
[1:55:39] <%chiazam> gonna want affect mind as always
[1:55:40] <+OwlLightningMage> Call Manager
[1:55:40] <%NopeBadguy> don't confuse mind trick with affect/dominante mind
[1:55:42] <Laecerelius> PEW PEW PEW
[1:55:48] <dinnydanny777> Karen's do seem like they would use lightning
[1:55:48] <Huntercd> Tits?
[1:55:49] <Laecerelius> Use your zappy force to stop them!
[1:55:50] <%linSP> wheres force shit
[1:55:50] <%RetroCop87> drip with a CAP
[1:55:53] <+OwlLightningMage> Lightning out your tits
[1:55:54] <%0dokuro> Lightning tits?
[1:55:54] <%SomeSageAdvice> oh god we get to see if the sound effect bug is still there
[1:56:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> This is tangential, but I started playing Pillars of Eternity, another great RPG from Obsidian, and you all should too if you haven't yet :)
[1:56:02] <RandyFistburgers> shocking
[1:56:04] <Serial_Gurter> Fear the drip lightning!
[1:56:05] <%NopeBadguy> haha lightning go BRRRRR
[1:56:06] <Twiton> Still hope we get a Directors Cut for all of these Obsidian games missing content
[1:56:06] <kipperxl> can't go wrong with unlimited power
[1:56:07] <%AzureGale> Force Drip
[1:56:07] <1matheuw> wat?
[1:56:12] <%UvBenServed> Force Drip
[1:56:13] <%chiazam> Can you talk to Kreia gain yet?
[1:56:15] <OldManDeckardCain> be careful or you will shart lightning like Rey LUL
[1:56:16] <+bugz_munny> Karens have been known to shoot force lightning randomly
[1:56:17] <+OwlLightningMage> It... doesn't
[1:56:19] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Mind Trick is one of the most insidious and evil power in Star Wars and the Jedi use it all the time
[1:56:20] <+Silv3rS0und> SAVED KappaRoss
[1:56:22] <+stickacus> stickacus subscribed with Prime. 
[1:56:23] <1matheuw> RELOAD TEH SAVE
[1:56:23] <%SomeSageAdvice> eyyyy we're not dead from ear piercing noise
[1:56:26] <%democrazyyy> i really cant wait to see how he handles his companions, i hope he makes em evil jedi but ive never seen the negative influence stuff
[1:56:26] <%0dokuro> They have saves yes
[1:56:30] <Grandma_Amari> Force scream because managers, lightning because she is NOT afraid to use that taser
[1:56:39] <+OG_M_Bison> What difficulty is he playing on?
[1:56:41] <+thegreenbenis> Nice shooting, Tex.
[1:56:42] <+Local16> What happens when you call it drip lightning
[1:56:43] <%Teh_Un> The stormtrooper aim
[1:56:51] <GarbageQueenEllie> @OldManDeckardCain If Rey's character was actually just sharting force powers I would love her forever
[1:56:53] <s1rcuit> what's a save in rpg context?
[1:56:54] <%honeyman18> A robot passed the will check?
[1:56:58] <%0dokuro> Blaster Sith stonk
[1:57:00] <+bugz_munny> MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM
[1:57:08] <+Nymphonomicon> Jesus saves! His Cha and Wis are high af.
[1:57:09] <+thegreenbenis> Probably easy, knowing Pat.
[1:57:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> @garbagequeenellie Oops, all Force Powers
[1:57:20] <Badgerconda_> it's literally just third edition DnD, but in spaaaaaaaaace
[1:57:21] <%Undenizen> this is OLD school RPG.
[1:57:26] <Twiton> Now that's gotta hurt
[1:57:28] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt so it's like saying resist?
[1:57:30] <%AgniBrandt> In some cases, succeeding a save means a spell does NOTHING
[1:57:30] <Daxalog> Its so you have momments where characters power through something
[1:57:31] <%NopeBadguy> as well as mitigating certain status effects
[1:57:40] <+OwlLightningMage> Roll a d20 at your modifier
[1:57:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Or nothing, sometimes.
[1:57:44] <jackeroff3> So chat, who's your favorite sith?
[1:57:46] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt got it, thanks
[1:57:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Th3SmartAlec Like the South Park games but Star Wars
[1:57:49] <%etnoika> I cna never remember what Constitution is, I'm only familiar with FF and Warcraft rpg stats.
[1:57:51] <%0dokuro> Kinda, DnD is based on the the D20 system and in extension all the other stuff.
[1:57:52] <%democrazyyy> @PatStaresAt the real question to come is what kind of lightsaber are you gonna rock
[1:57:52] <HealingMind> do saves have a special scenario for perfect 20s?
[1:57:54] <%Maids4lyfe> oh it's the bean lady
[1:57:55] <+projectmanatees> Kriea LuvSign
[1:57:57] <$valkuma> half life reference LUL
[1:57:58] <%AzureGale> MIND MELD
[1:58:06] <+OwlLightningMage> Jar Jar Binks is my favorite sith
[1:58:07] <jmft2000> Would you play a mmorpg of Star Wars, if it were good?
[1:58:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> @jackeroff3 Revan or Kreia, without question
[1:58:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> Oh God she is the bean lady
[1:58:10] <%NopeBadguy> did you say "bed bay"
[1:58:11] <%chiazam> umm
[1:58:15] <+megaman_sentinel> she seems so trustworthy lol
[1:58:15] <%AzureGale> THE YOUNGLINGS ARE DEAD
[1:58:19] <1matheuw> nice lies kreya
[1:58:21] <%Undenizen> I'm actually really glad that games have largely steered away from using deice to decide combat. it sucks.
[1:58:28] <+Silv3rS0und> @s1rcuit a spell that auto hits makes the enemy roll a saving throw. If they succeed they take half damage. If they fail, they take full damage or nothing.
[1:58:31] <%Undenizen> *dice
[1:58:34] <%chiazam> they didn't spare you
[1:58:34] <jackeroff3> Kreia and Revan for personality, Exar Kun for sheer bad ass moments
[1:58:35] <LorcaNomad> wee
[1:58:35] <alyss988> wee
[1:58:35] <Meekest> Exile Drip
[1:58:43] <%NopeBadguy> so what's the nickname we're putting on this char like pockets
[1:58:44] <%0dokuro> Let her spin da gun
[1:58:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @HealingMind Not typically, be it tabletop or computer, but if it is a tabletop deal then that's up to the DM
[1:58:53] <1matheuw> now do it with two guns
[1:58:55] <notsoy> they also gave us force speed
[1:58:55] <%SaiyanShoto> She sounds like Frieza LUL LUL
[1:58:56] <%a_goth_pancake> twiiiiirl
[1:59:00] <+Silv3rS0und> @s1rcuit edit: full damage on a fail. half or nothing on a success
[1:59:02] <+nirvana227> LUL
[1:59:02] <jackeroff3> He detonates a star, hypnotizes the whole senate on Coruscant, and lives as a spirit for thousands of years
[1:59:03] <+dante_must_die_exe> oh NO
[1:59:05] <taquito_blade> this pc or OG xbox?
[1:59:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> @jackeroff3 oooh, Exar-kun!! Sugoi~~
[1:59:07] <+dante_must_die_exe> not darth karen
[1:59:07] <Grandma_Amari> Now dual wield them to become Blaster Ocelot

[1:59:10] <+projectmanatees> Speeens
[1:59:10] <+bear_breaker20> dar car
[1:59:13] <%Radioactivetaco9> reminds me of the flip gun button in dusk
[1:59:14] <HealingMind> @Valentinius_Anodyne Thanks for answering!
[1:59:14] <+reallybigrocks> Darth Kae'Ryn Drippo

[1:59:32] <%AzureGale> Imagine becoming a Sith lord because you couldn't use an expired coupon
[1:59:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> With Saves, they were the one that got to roll against a static difficulty to resist. Ordinary attacks have you rolling against the enemy's static Armor Class.
[1:59:35] <HealingMind> Somewhat limited POWERRRRRRR
[1:59:37] <%SaiyanShoto> Darth Drip is good
[1:59:37] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL

[1:59:47] <%toolofparanoia> I agree with this fully
[1:59:50] <%NopeBadguy> as my old ap us history teacher said, blonde isn't a hair color, it's a state of mind
[1:59:51] <1matheuw> ngl id slap that polygon ass amirite gameRs?
[1:59:52] <%Teh_Un> I find your lack of managers...disturbing....
[1:59:52] <%SirGO0SE> "bottle" blonde? thats the first time ive heard that term
[1:59:54] <%chiazam> bottle blonde??????
[1:59:55] <+OwlLightningMage> Karen from fight club is
[1:59:56] <fuji_92> I've seen karen of all hair colors

[2:00:27] <%0dokuro> White hair all da way
[2:00:30] <+Silv3rS0und> Karen's always have a dumb blonde hair color
[2:00:36] <Badgerconda_> woolie be woolie
[2:00:41] <%Maids4lyfe> dirty blonde just means light brown

[2:01:07] <HotMafia81> Be mindful: he dumb
[2:01:07] <KeiPrime> p u r e p a z a a k

[2:01:10] <Twiton> There's several good mods BTW for this that let you have more choice in what sort of character Revan was.

[2:01:26] <%delilah4you> Whos the HOT LADY
[2:01:26] <%DeadManProp> Don't diss Atton. He's cool.
[2:01:30] <asylumkon> woolie initially called him barth
[2:01:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> Atton is an edgy Space Himbo, and thats why we love hiiim
[2:01:31] <TheAdMerlin> Is Kaiden worse Carth?
[2:01:31] <%AzureGale> The mouse has UNLIMITED POWERRRRRRRR
[2:01:31] <ape_hawk> what if you were looking at his cell via camera and he was just jerkin it??

[2:02:00] <+Silv3rS0und> @Valentinius_Anodyne yeah, i assumed he was Carth Clone in my first playthrough and spec'd him for blasters. Boy was that dumb of me LUL
[2:02:00] <%Nekros4442> Theres the Carth
[2:02:00] <CrypticMochi> Just tuning in, but I am I crazy thinking the Exile has a Karen vibe?

[2:02:07] <Grandma_Amari> @ape_hawk Dirty blonde generally means a sort of brown-blonde, or like a blonde with multiple hues to it, it's not a solid color. It's a natural color.
[2:02:08] <+megaman_sentinel> that look
[2:02:08] <kipperxl> omg its han solo lite
[2:02:10] <+chaumiester> Aw... you're a not great pal, at least skim his LP

[2:02:12] <%wruce__billis> For some reason I couldn't take Kreia seriously anymore after Lonesome Road and Ulysses
[2:02:12] <DatAsuna> Kaidan's better than carth
[2:02:13] <KaiserMario> Carth is such a low bar, even a banana peel could be called "better Carth"
[2:02:16] <%democrazyyy> i love you atton have my babies
[2:02:17] <Grandma_Amari> I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER ATON

[2:02:32] <HotMafia81> Why's it weird to sit and laugh at your friend's videos in a room, by yourself, and say nothing to them about it? That's weird? You're weird.
[2:02:34] <%Garthunox> Nephew to Ayn

[2:03:06] <%damienlunas> Why doesn't force lightning blow up Peragus then
[2:03:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> pat being in front of the text is to make it more immersive
[2:03:08] <+HeroSolaire> Do a paige voice for your protagonist
[2:03:13] <subjectg> @garbagequeenellie disciple was simping for you before this game starts
[2:03:14] <%NichStachel> Star Wars! Lets Go!

[2:03:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> MK II PogChamp
[2:03:23] <sponsoredviewer910> LUL that would never happen
[2:03:23] <HealingMind> So, does he just have to stand for days, or risk burning himself while sleeping?
[2:03:24] <%0dokuro> However decided this mine was a good idea needs fired...by a blaster
[2:03:26] <%ssjklyco> Karens nickname is Packets. On account of the packets of blond hair dye she carries to ensure maximum blondness
[2:03:27] <%libra_zero> it seems nonsensical that this place hasn't already exploded (again)
[2:03:28] <%umbypokochan> why does Pat's character look like that lady from CSI: Miami?

[2:03:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> @subjectg Shit you're right, I forgot! Damn, that's creepy
[2:03:35] <$Quiet__Viking> I'm still not sure why Atton is on Peragus
[2:03:38] <HotMafia81> "Pop detonator" is maybe the most casually stupid Star Wars concept.
[2:03:38] <+Silv3rS0und> The real question isn't Han or Carth vs Atton. The real question is who is cooler: Atton or Dash Rendar?
[2:03:43] <Twiton> Some Restored Content stuff has audio changes, you'll notice it occassionally.

[2:05:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Silv3rS0und LUL At least he has decent Dex. Still, if it's any consolation, the game tricking you like that means they succeeded narrative-wise
[2:05:14] <s1rcuit> ok guys, I talked to a guy who said only Jedi can activate lightsabers, there any truth to that?
[2:05:22] <jackeroff3> jedi run liek babies

[2:05:58] <%FacetiousAF> revan's penis was HUGE
[2:05:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Only a force sensitive can use darksabers, anyone can use a lightsaber.
[2:05:59] <%0dokuro> Honestly the Jedi and Sith parallels in this game are great and really identify the problems both sides have.
[2:06:00] <s1rcuit> @libra_zero fucking thought so

[2:06:48] <KeiPrime> explain
[2:06:51] <Grandma_Amari> The downside to Darth Karen is she's not going to look as much like a Karen as she becomes more dark side
[2:06:57] <%democrazyyy> atton is gonna simp his way straight to the dark side
[2:07:00] <heartlesshealer> oh god, he's playing a lady, so we get actually Carth 2
[2:07:03] <Twiton> Atton wants your Dark Side Points
[2:07:04] <+Fapbsi> women are by nature dark jedis?
[2:07:10] <%Puhff> Is Paige still there?
[2:07:14] <HotMafia81> If only you could just make Atton too horny to not realize he's going to the dark side.
[2:07:14] <+superchronicc> say no
[2:07:15] <+thegreenbenis> Light side is made up of Karens.
[2:07:15] <%chiazam> So then you do know what happened

[2:08:11] <%chiazam> Cut him with a gun???
[2:08:12] <Twiton> You can even say Revan was an introvert that never liked anyone. Revan too busy with their droids
[2:08:12] <HotMafia81> No time for business Atton, gotta leave the dead space station
[2:08:15] <Grandma_Amari> @heartlesshealer At least unlike Carth, he isn't a lil bitch who won't murder a child when Karen tells him to.

[2:08:56] <Twiton> Oh no, he didn't choose if Carth was a horn dog or if Revan said "no horny" to him. I don't know what the default is

[2:10:10] <Twiton> I swear it's a default thing, I'll check the Strategy Thing
[2:10:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> Only Darth Karen can acream loud enough to be heard in space
[2:10:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> Atton isn't Better Carth, Carth is Worse Atton

[2:13:27] <%QueequegTheater> @reallybigrocks It's going to be fine. In terms of actual harm, this was no worse than the summer.
[2:13:29] <%a_goth_pancake> oh wow, I hadn't seen the new crazy talk animation
[2:13:30] <Sokumotanaka> I like to think that's woolie's revan and he totally gets owned by him XD
[2:13:31] <%dekkitout> Uncourteousness is a pathway to dark abilities some consider to be unnatural
[2:13:35] <%a_goth_pancake> that's sick, Viking.
[2:13:47] <+HeroSolaire> I never understoond 1 thing chat. why pat has hair in this animation LUL
[2:13:52] <%GarbageNirvana> @reallybigrocks I mean yeah but the fuck can you do except watch it happen
[2:14:08] <%GarbageNirvana> I'd rather watch this right now
[2:14:23] <+reallybigrocks> @GarbageNirvana True enough
[2:14:27] <+Jaysky> PogChamp
[2:14:29] <%GalacticaPhanto> @herosolaire VoltaBass was a young man, unsure of his place in life and we got hairy Pat
[2:14:30] <Sokumotanaka> @HeroSolaire Actually it's a force mind trick on us to make us think he has hair
[2:14:31] <%Ascethetic> just got back, pee break?
[2:14:37] <dinnydanny777> It's funny, if it's Dark side to just be a dick to everyone aren't a lot of the Jedi in the movies Dark side? LUL
[2:14:43] <+projectmanatees> So instead of hoes mad it’s managers mad
[2:14:50] <+tyrianfolly> Yeah, pee break

[2:15:11] <%Sol_Install> PogChamp
[2:15:19] <Twiton> Ah, it does indeed seem like you only get to choose with the Alternative Revan Romances. Never mind, Carth will just be whatever the game chooses. Bastila is sadly only visible for 1 thing for female exiles IIRC
[2:15:33] <moonmintparadise> PogChamp
[2:15:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I love when store workers a filmed going, "Bitch, I am the manager. And what?"
[2:15:42] <%GalacticaPhanto> I wonder if Pat will invest in Twerka Industries like their CEO Woolz
[2:15:44] <%dekkitout> @dinnydanny777 That's usually hand waved as "sith trickery" or "woops we built a temple on an ancient sith burial ground again"
[2:15:48] <%Sol_Install> twitch remove wow
[2:15:51] <DestroyerPhoenix> wow, is it gone from twitch altogether?
[2:15:52] <moonmintparadise> oh heh apparently twitch is removing the pogchamp emote because gottecks cant keep his mouth shut
[2:15:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @dinnydanny777 Arguably, you're probably on to something there. But alas, it is likely a lost cause to expect a nuanced narrative from a Star Wars movie
[2:16:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh shit, did twitch do a live takedown of pogchamp

[2:16:33] <+Vijuani> omg
[2:16:36] <moonmintparadise> @Valentinius_Anodyne Disney could never make a Jedi Civil War story because Gray Morals do not sell toys.

[2:23:34] <%Bailey__gaming> I got a screen shot of the emote list with a hole where pog man was
[2:23:35] <+Nymphonomicon> T3 is the best scienceman.
[2:23:37] <chll0ne> @herosolaire whaaaaaat cmonBruh
[2:23:43] <%QueequegTheater> @vangardia Gootecks posted video of a woman getting killed in the Capitol building so PogChamp is dead
[2:23:45] <EternalJedi> rooPog
[2:23:50] <$Calval1er> are there graphics mods on this or is it just way better looking than i remember?
[2:23:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> @kastev ok, THAT part, yes
[2:23:53] <CollinsOfBodom> PogChamp
[2:23:55] <Sokumotanaka> for a guy who fears stabbing you say alot of stab worthy stuff. Leave T3 alone or perish
[2:23:57] <+YourNastyBoy> good shit fuck gootecks
[2:24:03] <Coystick> Nahahaha Twitch Banned Pogchamp
[2:24:04] <Twiton> Another good mod is the one that lets you choose Mira or Hanharr, removing the need to be Light Side to later make Mira Dark Side.
[2:24:06] <%dekkitout> It's no CW, but FO is aiight
[2:24:06] <%mistymntns> yes guys we get it pogchamp is dead now lay off it
[2:24:08] <balthazar758> damn

[2:24:13] <%0dokuro> calm down T3
[2:24:21] <Tooniearcade> woooo stay dead PogChamp
[2:24:21] <+Nymphonomicon> Shock arm, always use shock arm.
[2:24:22] <Twiton> Because Hanharr just is unfinished ;-;
[2:24:24] <dinnydanny777> See that lightning? That's Darth T3's force lightning
[2:24:26] <JRACjr> Oh well, guess I'll use this one kzxDoggers
[2:24:31] <%0dokuro> He's...interesting
[2:24:33] <kastev> @Th3SmartAlec Also, I don't know much about this situation, but was all he did post a video of someone dying? Or was it making fun of them or something like that?
[2:24:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> cuz she cute
[2:24:40] <+Nymphonomicon> It's free, unlimited use, and always works.
[2:24:45] <Tooniearcade> psaDogchamp
[2:24:45] <%0dokuro> ya you need it pretty hard
[2:24:47] <%SirGO0SE> same
[2:24:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> No though
[2:24:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> her hair sucks tho
[2:24:55] <%dekkitout> Hanharr was 3 edgy for you
[2:24:55] <dinnydanny777> @kastev I think posting a video of someone dying is enough.
[2:25:00] <+Nymphonomicon> You can't make Hanharr a Jedi.
[2:25:02] <USOtaku> Is this gonna be a light or dark side playthrough?
[2:25:05] <%libra_zero> you have to burn AT LEAST 2 orphanages to get Sith enough for Hanharr
[2:25:07] <balthazar758> what a way to start the year
[2:25:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can get enough dark side points from Telos alone.
[2:25:23] <jobin_stream> PogChamp
[2:25:27] <%0dokuro> Can you?
[2:25:27] <%QueequegTheater> You were too nice
[2:25:29] <dogekingjojo> PogChamp
[2:25:30] <%dekkitout> Hanharr is gated behind 2 behelits
[2:25:31] <Twiton> Mira is way better to corrupt. Hanharr just gets really sad
[2:25:35] <%Ellila> Today's been fucking wild. Snoop Dogg just did a fucking body splash from the top rope.
[2:25:38] <%Th3SmartAlec> @kastev it was a very... politically charged Tweet regarding the recent events in the U.S. capitol
[2:25:39] <DestroyerPhoenix> is mira just a flat out better companion? like viability-wise
[2:25:40] <%Monkeyweed21> last time you were like 20

[2:26:13] <%NichStachel> Cheer500 We’ve been needing to elect a new PogChamp for quite some time now tbh
[2:26:14] <Twiton> @DestroyerPhoenix Mira has more non cut content. Hanharr was never fully fleshed out.
[2:26:19] <%0dokuro> Muka Shaka Paka time when?
[2:26:23] <kastev> @Th3SmartAlec Well, I extremely disagree with Twitch's actions, but w/e, it's their platform. They're just extremely hypocritical about what they choose to remove
[2:26:26] <Sapphire_Breeze> PogChamp
[2:26:26] <ape_hawk> do you think t3 jacks off more than he jacks on?

[2:26:50] <Twiton> RCM makes Mira way more interesting for Dark Side, because Hanharr is still unable to be a Jedi or to appear after Ravenger

[2:30:06] <subjectg> @twiton remember that lore series they had that went over the history before TOR, that conveniently skipped over the events of kotor 2?

[2:31:39] <kastev> @PatStaresAt Pat, are you using the restored content mod?
[2:31:40] <%0dokuro> We got 2 more years of EA making Star Wars games.
[2:31:42] <%Dementedpenguin> I mean, we also have to keep in mind people are coming and going in chat. So it's getting repeated a lot.
[2:31:47] <%0dokuro> Unless they renew the contract.
[2:31:48] <%DeadManProp> @kastev Kotor2 is not a niche game by any means
[2:31:49] <Twiton> @QueequegTheater Director's Cut would be the best way to do that.
[2:31:53] <El_GhostV1> No more pogo
[2:31:56] <+fishteevee> fishteevee subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:32:00] <Retinolgaming> @kastev They sold well in thier time, and its star wars. Good star wars games will sell copies. If they can bring back ME after andromeda nothings off the table at EA.

[2:32:14] <Twiton> Ahh
[2:32:16] <subjectg> @deadmanprop face it, it’s pretty niche by typical star wars fan standards
[2:32:18] <kastev> @DeadManProp I was talking about the gameplay and how Zoomers don't really like slow-paced RPG games
[2:32:23] <%QueequegTheater> A big current gen re-skin with finished content
[2:32:24] <Twiton> I was just weary of the word Remaster
[2:32:28] <2DSuperiority> Pogchamp okay but imagine the face tho
[2:32:33] <%etnoika> Oh shit they removed the pogchamp emote
[2:32:41] <Twiton> Yeah, and getting modders/fans to help out as well
[2:32:49] <Twiton> GOG could do that
[2:32:59] <kastev> @PatStaresAt Pat, are you using the restored content mod?
[2:32:59] <CloudCircus> Is this one of those nerd gam3s?
[2:33:00] <DatAsuna> @Sphincter_Spelunker honestly, immediately after kotet/iokath was probably the lowpoint of the game, a bad mini-story about a traitor in the alliance. However the new expansion onslaught is great, we got onderon, a rad new asteroid underworld town, the ruins of ossus and a big resolution to the revan/exile stuff for scourge and kira's return. Now the story is teasing a promising mandalorian civil war with shae.
[2:33:00] <%CrowbarFacelift> Apparently pogchamp guy said some pretty pog shit
[2:33:01] <NanayaPeng> Lotta people gonna audition to be the new PogChamp face and a lot of em are probably gonna look like ahegao faces lmao
[2:33:02] <KiryujiKazamoto> that's the Revan face i always chose
[2:33:05] <%ClericOfSparda> PogChamp
[2:33:07] <Twiton> But GOG apparently isn't able to even get the new KOTOR 2 update. It's stuck in the non-steam update.
[2:33:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that was a loud walk

[2:34:30] <$zackalan> PogChamp is a classic emote
[2:34:30] <%chiazam> @Meekest sounds good to me
[2:34:31] <cronicconquest> PJSalt
[2:34:33] <%QueequegTheater> @cumurasame he has
[2:34:36] <Twiton> BTW, RCM has voice actors that are Modding Community. Not actual KOTOR 2 VAs
[2:34:37] <%iosephe> Who will be the Twitch's next PogChamp?
[2:34:46] <DatAsuna> @Sphincter_Spelunker black mandalore was rad. the new villain is this hardline lady who speaks in mando'a more
[2:34:48] <Twiton> Since some content was only in text, not voiced.
[2:34:52] <kastev> Imagine being a Jedi in the KOTOR time period where apparently everyone hates you
[2:34:52] <EternalJedi> rooPog
[2:34:54] <%NichStachel> PatChamp
[2:34:56] <+Goku01899> Gootecks got what he deserved
[2:34:56] <%toolofparanoia> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[2:34:59] <%za7az> psaDogchamp
[2:35:02] <%QueequegTheater> @Twiton Nothing for the major characters, though, right?
[2:35:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> @kastev This will be a topic as people come in. I imagine it will remain the topic for tonight.
[2:35:05] <+smuggleruncle> they removed PogChamp PogChamp
[2:35:10] <EternalJedi> kastev limesFeels
[2:35:11] <Grandma_Amari> PogChamp test
[2:35:11] <+smuggleruncle> oh not yet LUL
[2:35:16] <+nirvana227> better than taris lol
[2:35:17] <Sapphire_Breeze> it's a cool investigation mystery
[2:35:19] <%chiazam> DARTH T3
[2:35:20] <%Nekros4442> I mean...i've played alot of JRPGs. This isnt the worst build up
[2:35:21] <DatAsuna> Watch pat say peragus sucks anyway in a week
[2:35:23] <%SirGO0SE> the worst of it is the mines
[2:35:24] <%tyrianfolly> unroolie, the 21 and done bitch fuck you guy
[2:35:25] <Clundy> I remember it being shorter
[2:35:30] <Daxalog> I remember being lost
[2:35:34] <+GrassCannon> Once you know what you're doing, it goes a lot faster
[2:35:36] <asylumkon> the mystery of peragus is cool it just doesnt tie into the rest of the game
[2:35:36] <Sapphire_Breeze> Endar Spire?
[2:35:37] <%MidnightBurst12> endar spire?
[2:35:38] <%shurtal> Endar Spire
[2:35:38] <kastev> @Th3SmartAlec Yeah, I know... it's just really annoying to have this stuff continually going on
[2:35:39] <%AtomicHeartSon> Endar Spire @PatStaresAt
[2:35:39] <Grandma_Amari> Oooh, I see. PogChamp is still showing up for me because I'm using that twitch alternate player.
[2:35:41] <BlueLunecy> The Endar Spire
[2:35:42] <KiryujiKazamoto> Harbinger
[2:35:42] <kulmoth> well they are gonna replace PogChamp so theres nothing to worry, we just remove that shitlord gootecks
[2:35:43] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> ENDAR SPIRE
[2:35:45] <jeffishype> rip pogchamp lmao
[2:35:46] <%Alazull> The Republic cruiser?
[2:35:47] <%CrowbarFacelift> but way longer
[2:35:47] <%twistedj3ster> It's got good mystery atmosphere
[2:35:48] <KiryujiKazamoto> dammit my meory is shite
[2:35:48] <%YakumoYomi> Endar Spire
[2:35:49] <TheRealNumberJ42> PogChamp
[2:35:51] <%chiazam> That ship
[2:35:54] <+smuggleruncle> i can see mine PogChamp but not others
[2:35:56] <%Alazull> Yeah the Endar Spire
[2:36:00] <%a_goth_pancake> endar spires bigger, angrier brother.
[2:36:01] <%Agami23> i could see this being annoying replaying it over and over, maybe.
[2:36:03] <+smuggleruncle> bttv i guess
[2:36:04] <cronicconquest> Pat i love you
[2:36:04] <Twiton> @QueequegTheater Yeah, no revoiced lines for them. M4's planet does have some voice mixing done to add in the lines that weren't voiced.
[2:36:05] <%Selmassian> Selmassian subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[2:36:06] <$Calval1er> Is pat heel or face?
[2:36:08] <subjectg> @deadmanprop star wars in public consciousness is usually within clone wars - galactic civil war eras, is what I mean.
[2:36:09] <silver__viii> Honestly the only thing that gets me about Peragus is that Telos follows right after, so you don't have free reign for a lot of the beginning of the game. Other than that, I don't mind it that much
[2:36:13] <kastev> @PatStaresAt So did you like KOTOR 1 or KOTOR 2 more?
[2:36:19] <%tyrianfolly> Pat is playing Kae'Ryn
[2:36:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> Kotor2
[2:36:28] <%mikessdd> This is like a bigger endar spire. Then yeah Telos is similar to Taris I suppose.
[2:36:30] <%QueequegTheater> @Twiton I always skip M4, it was cut super early for a reason
[2:36:30] <Twiton> I'd have to grab a look at the credits, hol on
[2:36:31] <EternalJedi> smuggleruncle I have bttv and can't, you'll prolly stop seeing it when you refresh
[2:36:36] <%tyrianfolly> DARK SIDE NOW, DARK SIDE FOREVER
[2:36:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> @calval1er Dark Jedi Kappa
[2:36:38] <%toolofparanoia> MORE LIKE A BETTER DROID POGCHAMP
[2:36:38] <+PenmanLupine> doodAnime doodKen doodLewd the8bitPog
[2:36:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> Kreia makes this game
[2:36:41] <Retinolgaming> The character writing in 2 is so much better.
[2:36:42] <%0dokuro> The story was amazing which slightly made it up
[2:36:49] <kastev> Nice
[2:36:52] <%0dokuro> mostly the narrative
[2:36:55] <%CrowbarFacelift> kotor 2 on xbox was something
[2:36:55] <+Skelegroove> 2 Has a much better story
[2:36:56] <+smuggleruncle> @EternalJedi aye probably
[2:36:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Dark Later?
[2:36:57] <Twiton> M4 has issues, but I still was glad to play it
[2:37:00] <%a_goth_pancake> unless you're speedrunning, the "tutorial" of this game is a solid 3 or 4 hours.
[2:37:02] <Halospaz117> 2
[2:37:05] <%shurtal> I played Kotor 2 on the xbox, dropped it sometime after Telos
[2:37:06] <%chiazam> Pat have you never played the restored content mod??
[2:37:06] <$Calval1er> @Th3SmartAlec sith waifu. why am i not surprised
[2:37:07] <kastev> 1 and 2 are so amazing but 2 is definitely the sperior game
[2:37:07] <Arek_1> Okay, now PogChamp is gone from BetterTwitchTV, as well.
[2:37:08] <%slimmixrp> I mean
[2:37:09] <%0dokuro> Ye
[2:37:11] <kastev> superior *
[2:37:12] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Did you install the cut planet too
[2:37:16] <Retinolgaming> Kreia is the best star wars character. Her and Kyle Katarn.
[2:37:23] <+smuggleruncle> PogChamp test
[2:37:27] <%I_chose_Rapture> KomodoHype
[2:37:28] <Twiton> Ah, only M4 has new VAs
[2:37:29] <PinkSocks> Good comparison
[2:37:31] <DatAsuna> except kotor 1 is way better than fallout 3
[2:37:32] <%mikessdd> I played through kotor 2 around the time Woolie was finishing their play through. With the RCM it’s so much better. I played through multiple times on a GD Xbox before that.
[2:37:32] <%SolidusRex> PogChamp
[2:37:34] <CrypticMochi> There’s still some cut companion stuff at the end though
[2:37:34] <subjectg> @deadmanprop so i think we misunderstood each other in that i was thinking niche in the lore way when you meant niche in the gameplay way
[2:37:35] <%AsHeadsIsTails> Makes sense same developer
[2:37:35] <EternalJedi> rooPog
[2:37:35] <+BotanicMoney> Bye pogchamp
[2:37:35] <%NovaKnightmare> KOTOR 1 was better than Fallout 3
[2:37:35] <Twiton> RCM has only 2 VAs
[2:37:36] <%QueequegTheater> Good, it's very much unfinished
[2:37:37] <Twiton> * Usagi - Kaevee * Zhaboka - Taris Traveler
[2:37:37] <deerlearning> washington dc @PatStaresAt
[2:37:38] <+smuggleruncle> nope not seeying it anymore
[2:37:41] <UltimateDomon> Some things were cut for a reason
[2:37:43] <kulmoth> the droid planet is awful, no idea why they even dug that shit up
[2:37:45] <%chiazam> Jesus the end of the game doesn't even exist without restored content
[2:37:46] <%AtomicHeartSon> god please no one ever install M4-78, it's not worth it
[2:37:54] <%Garthunox> CMON
[2:38:03] <%Garthunox> KOTOR 1 is not Fallout 3
[2:38:08] <%chiazam> @AtomicHeartSon Is that the HK planet?
[2:38:10] <%Garthunox> Thats such an insult
[2:38:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> F
[2:38:10] <%dekkitout> D:
[2:38:12] <Maleicus> rcm usually broke something else in the game so i never really liked it
[2:38:13] <Twiton> I was just glad to kill 2 more Jedi
[2:38:13] <+nirvana227> D:
[2:38:13] <smiggyballs13> Hey guys

[2:38:15] <Clundy> When’s Pat gonna play Republic Commando?
[2:38:17] <walnutcast> more like CUMTOR
[2:38:18] <%QueequegTheater> Man they didn't even try to pretend he's not R2
[2:38:19] <UndeadManatee> F
[2:38:22] <%dekkitout> I can't believe T3 is fookin ded
[2:38:24] <kastev> BLAP

[2:38:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> butt
[2:38:59] <Twiton> @chiazam Yep, all the RCM stuff. But not M4, just like Pat is planning not to.
[2:39:01] <%AtomicHeartSon> @chiazam Woolie played the HK stuff, it's part of the Restored Content Mod.
[2:39:01] <dinnydanny777> Heck Atton
[2:39:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> fuck, the "My Little PogChamp" meme sure hits different now don't it?
[2:39:03] <%Garthunox> Vaganya

[2:39:06] <%QueequegTheater> @Sapphire_Breeze Of course not, he's Barth
[2:39:13] <+terry_quest> is your character wearing sneakers?
[2:39:14] <%etnoika> ...does this character say the same thing if you play a a male?
[2:39:14] <pilllowofbees> why are our wearing sneakers LUL
[2:39:20] <%mikessdd> Oh pat going fem? Is he going to actually rp or is he going for “canon”
[2:39:22] <subjectg> @th3smartalec good thing i never liked that meme
[2:39:23] <andimustmask> apparently pogchamp anis getting removed due to some SUPER terrible takes from the dude in question
[2:39:26] <%QueequegTheater> @etnoika no
[2:39:27] <Retinolgaming> BARTH = better Carth
[2:39:29] <kastev> @etnoika No
[2:39:30] <Twiton> Atton needs to stop thinking with his dick and start thinking with his desire for JEDI BLOOD
[2:39:32] <smiggyballs13> Please don’t stare at me in this half cheek long dress

[2:39:47] <%AzureGale> Rolling around at the speed of sound
[2:39:49] <lovesosa236> PogChamp
[2:39:49] <%dekkitout> @Twiton So thinking with his dick?

[2:40:17] <+Goku01899> Replace PogChamp with PAWGChamp
[2:40:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> Atton's a man after Pat's own heart
[2:40:18] <+nirvana227> evillll
[2:40:19] <silver__viii> bully BibleThump
[2:40:20] <cumurasame> Oh my god, I got so used to Woolie's Atton always wearing shades that seeing him without it is creeping me out, he's more handsome than I thought

[2:40:24] <balthazar758> sick
[2:40:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Demand to see the manager music
[2:40:27] <%mikessdd> Sick. I played a good boy in my most recent run.
[2:40:27] <BlueMage64> Is Pat playing Dark Side again? silly pat

[2:40:39] <+projectmanatees> Yes
[2:40:43] <%doomunderthestairs> I take it you're going for a dark side run pat?
[2:40:45] <BaronVonProlix> Darth Karen gainst power
[2:40:45] <kastev> @Shockrates20XX Looks like it
[2:40:46] <%YakumoYomi> Alright, John. WE GET IT!
[2:40:48] <Clundy> @shockrates20xx ye
[2:40:51] <orphan_ash> is this game worth buying on steam ?
[2:40:53] <+PenmanLupine> it's better from what I remember on Woolie's run
[2:40:54] <%QueequegTheater> He looks fine
[2:40:54] <%0dokuro> Definitely worked.
[2:40:55] <Retinolgaming> @PatStaresAt It is better than original.
[2:40:56] <ihatemylifeitsux> is pat using any mods?
[2:40:58] <cheapdoc> yeah
[2:41:02] <+EkinRaider> on my 4k TV he looks pretty good
[2:41:03] <%doomunderthestairs> it does look better
[2:41:04] <balthazar758> Darth Gremlin
[2:41:06] <leinadtonu> I'm starting to get the impression this is not going to be a light side LP...
[2:41:08] <%QueequegTheater> @orphan_ash that's the only place it IS worth buying
[2:41:12] <%chiazam> I think you not knowing proves it worked
[2:41:13] <Kaiser_Loar> turn on rtx
[2:41:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no, but sure
[2:41:16] <Clundy> Looks upscaled to me
[2:41:16] <smiggyballs13> When did this game come out?
[2:41:19] <+ElectricHoodie> yeah this happens to me all the time
[2:41:20] <+Skelegroove> Games look better in your memory
[2:41:20] <Retinolgaming> LUL yes
[2:41:21] <%chiazam> Cause it'd look like shit
[2:41:21] <%Anime_Flux> LUL
[2:41:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> @andimustmask agreed, I didn't mean context like an excuse
[2:41:24] <%Mr_Pylon> Good old memory fill
[2:41:24] <+nirvana227> LUL
[2:41:24] <%FacetiousAF> 2005??
[2:41:25] <+Plus_On_Black> Damn, Young MA is healthy.
[2:41:26] <%0dokuro> Ya
[2:41:26] <+PenmanLupine> for sure
[2:41:29] <%doomunderthestairs> I had the same thing with new vegas
[2:41:29] <Profmcstevie> Imagination meet reality
[2:41:29] <Sokumotanaka> no I dont play pc that's too much work
[2:41:30] <dan_g_v> gane feom 1992
[2:41:31] <%NichStachel> Ah, she’s also red LULW Should’ve just waited to see that for his alignment
[2:41:31] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Atton looks okay in the original anyway
[2:41:31] <cumurasame> BTW Pat, do a Woolie and pill the endgame content items on like the 2nd planet
[2:41:32] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that happens LUL
[2:41:32] <Badgerconda_> @smiggyballs13 2005ish i think
[2:41:35] <Grandma_Amari> OH YEAH
[2:41:36] <%FacetiousAF> Dec. 2004
[2:41:38] <Arek_1> LUL
[2:41:44] <%mikessdd> @orphan_ash steam is the easiest place to get the restored content mod working. It’s as easy and clicking a button basically
[2:41:44] <%Srthunda> number one source of modding anxiety
[2:41:45] <andimustmask> @Th3SmartAlec i'm agreeing with you, no worries
[2:41:45] <%dekkitout> Google machine cays Dec 04
[2:41:46] <$DocMadfox> Fuck I thought this was gonna start at 10
[2:41:46] <Clundy> Did you mean New Vegas modding? LUL
[2:41:50] <orphan_ash> @QueequegTheater thanks for letting me know :-)
[2:41:54] <+dante_must_die_exe> that looks okay
[2:41:54] <+Shockrates20XX> Oh hey is that minimap even modded?
[2:41:55] <%TinyLittleDancer> Games had the sharpest of corners back in the day
[2:41:57] <Grandma_Amari> Pre-rendered
[2:42:00] <HotMafia81> Good rock, 8/10
[2:42:00] <%0dokuro> You can still see the blur when walking up to the texture before it renders, but its so much better
[2:42:02] <leinadtonu> I dunno I put everything in 480 p.
[2:42:16] <%QueequegTheater> @orphan_ash the Restored Content mod is in the workshop for it, it's basically required content
[2:42:17] <+ElectricHoodie> With modding Oblivion I was like "Is any of this shit working?" I turned it all off....yeah, turns out eyes are fucking stupid
[2:42:21] <Coystick> Modern indie games with lo fi graphics/textures, but like AMAZING shadows & lightning do that really well
[2:42:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oh yeah
[2:42:23] <Twiton> Obsidian work on a dishcloth budget. Reuse everything, pin it on the engine being the same.
[2:42:23] <+GrassCannon> 14 months
[2:42:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 14 months
[2:42:26] <%dekkitout> That's a high bar to meet
[2:42:27] <Grandma_Amari> @PatStaresAt Did you turn off motion blur for the force speed?
[2:42:27] <%miguelrod777> jesus
[2:42:27] <Clundy> I want 512 resolution textures or it’s a no-play from me
[2:42:27] <jellssssss20> Imagine you had the Halo remake's "toggle old/new look button"
[2:42:33] <%doomunderthestairs> 14 months in the pot
[2:42:33] <%chiazam> too busy talking about textures
[2:42:34] <%0dokuro> The developer even said it was fucked up basically.
[2:42:36] <Twiton> Gain massive profits
[2:42:36] <+TheBitingIrish> DansGame ???
[2:42:38] <nivlac_555> so stupid
[2:42:38] <%chiazam> BECAUSE CHRISTMAS
[2:42:41] <%Dementedpenguin> DansGame
[2:42:45] <+terry_quest> NOOO

[2:42:49] <%RetroCop87> IT'S LIKE POETRY, IT RHYMES
[2:42:49] <%libra_zero> the reason was that LucasArts was burning to the ground at the time
[2:42:50] <%chiazam> WHYYYY
[2:42:50] <%dekkitout> This is pre Disney btw
[2:42:52] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Obsidian really needs to either get better management or get better at negotiating
[2:42:54] <+nirvana227> no D:
[2:42:57] <%Anime_Flux> in the Palpatine voice
[2:42:57] <DatAsuna> That's not how it was
[2:43:01] <+PenmanLupine> because Money, always because Money
[2:43:02] <ape_hawk> remember guys: bethesda didnt fuck over Obsidian; obsidian's management fucked over obsidian
[2:43:03] <%0dokuro> 14-16 months of development
[2:43:04] <TrollKing96> WHYY!!?
[2:43:09] <%walternatorz> lucasarts is palpatine
[2:43:11] <BaronVonProlix> What do you want NOT-Nathan Fillion!?
[2:43:11] <Grandma_Amari> LucasArts was very petty about devs outside them making good games.
[2:43:13] <DatAsuna> @libra_zero lucasarts literally offered them a delay and urhart forgot to sign the paperwork
[2:43:15] <%dekkitout> "It seems in your anger, you killed the patch"
[2:43:18] <Twiton> Remember, all of those armor reskins. And all of those re-used KOTOR 1 skins for late-game armour ;-;
[2:43:19] <%doomunderthestairs> surprised you just didn't make peach as your exile
[2:43:21] <Profmcstevie> LucasArts: "I AM THE SENATE! NO PATCH!!"
[2:43:25] <Sokumotanaka> Yeah it seems like all of Obsidians faults are always someone elses ACTUAL fault like bethesda and Lucus arts
[2:43:31] <Huntercd> George Lucas the dumbass
[2:43:33] <GarbageQueenEllie> It all seems to come down to management with these things
[2:43:33] <%ssjklyco> She's british now?
[2:43:33] <%Anime_Flux> LUL
[2:43:34] <%seedleash> sounds like the release cyberpunk 2077 kinda sorta
[2:43:34] <%0dokuro> LucasArts was also trying to make like 30 different Star Wars games at once back then.
[2:43:37] <%QueequegTheater> @doomunderthestairs no redheads
[2:43:45] <Clundy> A
[2:43:48] <%0dokuro> Which was causing them to lose a shit ton of moeny
[2:43:48] <%malowry> malowry subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:43:50] <Siconia> Drip obtained
[2:43:51] <%0dokuro> money*
[2:44:00] <ChungusQuest> Look at that Vault suit!
[2:44:01] <leinadtonu> @DatAsuna forgot? Jesus...
[2:44:03] <Grandma_Amari> @doomunderthestairs He made Kae'ryn instead, soon-to-be Darth Kae'Ryn.
[2:44:04] <%RetroCop87> Why is Palpatine's voice so fun to do?
[2:44:07] <%chiazam> @PatStaresAt apparently, lucasarts literally offered them a delay and urhart forgot to sign the paperwork
[2:44:09] <+nirvana227> clothes nadedPog
[2:44:10] <jellssssss20> @PatStaresAt Do you have a "necessary mods" list for either these or the fallouts, that you have/could share?
[2:44:11] <%NichStachel> UNLIMITED VANILLA SOFTWARE!!!!!
[2:44:11] <%mikessdd> SKILLS FOR DAYS
[2:44:12] <DatAsuna> @Sokumotanaka don't roll with every excuse you hear, obsidian admitted lucasarts offered them a delay and they just forgot to sign the agreement and take it
[2:44:14] <cheapdoc> But now its based instead of drip
[2:44:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> niiiiiiice
[2:44:16] <Twiton> This game had a lot of stuff denied because of Lucas
[2:44:22] <%QueequegTheater> @0dokuro I do miss different developers getting to try it
[2:44:24] <%chiazam> dammit
[2:44:25] <Sapphire_Breeze> DEW IT
[2:44:27] <%AzureGale> Distracting for the droids, sure
[2:44:28] <%dekkitout> @RetroCop87 Because annunciation
[2:44:30] <%twistedj3ster> Atton needs horny jail
[2:44:30] <%a_goth_pancake> hey pat, are you going light or dark LUL
[2:44:31] <Twiton> "Hanharr can't die like this, too much like chewbaca."
[2:44:39] <USOtaku> So I take it we’re doing a dark side run then
[2:44:42] <%Anime_Flux> Whoopsie!
[2:44:43] <%0dokuro> Nope, the lead even said that he made it vocal that they felt this was rushed
[2:44:43] <%heyitsbrian> heyitsbrian subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! 
[2:44:46] <orphan_ash> @QueequegTheater just took a peek, do you mean the sith lords restored content or something else?
[2:44:47] <%wibbwobbler> the original cut of star wars was a completely different movie and it sucked
[2:44:49] <Twiton> "By the way, why does this game only have 1 Wookie. I swear I've only seen 1 in this entire game."
[2:44:50] <Clundy> Press X to Doubt
[2:44:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> Never let Wool-sidian buy the movie tickets
[2:44:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @twistedj3ster he's been in horny jail
[2:44:54] <%0dokuro> can look it up
[2:44:56] <dinnydanny777> Probably too busy selling toys
[2:44:56] <Badgerconda_> They had a verbal agreement, but no signed agreement. I don't think he 'forgot' but I could be wrong.
[2:44:58] <ape_hawk> yeah, obsidian's CEO aint smart
[2:44:59] <%QueequegTheater> @orphan_ash That's it
[2:45:00] <Twiton> "No wookies, just Carth."
[2:45:01] <%dekkitout> Big G Lucas loved to pimp out his franchise
[2:45:06] <HotMafia81> Nearly every video game at this point, tbh
[2:45:07] <balthazar758> dew it, release it
[2:45:08] <leinadtonu> How on earth do you forget to... nah, nvm.
[2:45:09] <%QueequegTheater> @orphan_ash The game literally wasn't finished at release
[2:45:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's super plausible, and I say that as someone who quite likes the stuff Obsidian puts out
[2:45:25] <Sokumotanaka> @DatAsuna Yeah but they still denied them the path you have to admit lucus arts has a reputation and a reason they're hard to work with.
[2:45:27] <%twistedj3ster> @Sphincter_Spelunker well he needs to go back before Darth Karen murders him
[2:45:30] <Twiton> Never forget Malachor V
[2:45:39] <+TopTieramisu> PogChamp
[2:45:42] <+PenmanLupine> yeah, if Good Guy Obsidian releases bugged and fucked up products consistently regardless of contract/publisher, there's only 1 consistent place to put blame on
[2:45:43] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Remember, Bethesda didn't fuck over Obsidian, Obsidian's management just assuming they would get the performance bonus fucked over Obsidian
[2:45:50] <%Anime_Flux> So are we going for "light side later", or mustache-twirling evil on this run?
[2:45:55] <%mikessdd> I wonder what prestige class pat’s gonna pick.
[2:45:57] <%Pyr0_Fr0st> @PatStaresAt The combination of todays events and your stream put an image of gungans stroming the senate
[2:45:59] <jellssssss20> Has anyone kept up with the Balder's Gate 3 patches? Is it being patched well?
[2:46:00] <%libra_zero> "this seems like it would literally never not be useful at any point in time. why would someone NOT use this?"
[2:46:00] <$Afterman_> dammmn she got a phatt ass
[2:46:01] <%chiazam> oh yeah that thing you warned me about

[2:46:28] <%Alazull> Yeah, in Star Wars
[2:46:28] <%0dokuro> @PatStaresAt Meyers also complained about the short deadline the development team had to deal with. Obsidian's COO, Chris Parker, said that the schedule set for the development team was "extremely aggressive", and that the team felt a lot of pressure because they were "making a sequel to the game of the year for 2003".

[2:46:52] <%Th3SmartAlec> "I love democracy."
[2:46:54] <Twiton> The Mando/Mira concept for Malachor really makes me sad that there's no material for even what they were going to do.

[2:48:06] <$DocMadfox> So Lightside later points, got it.
[2:48:06] <dinnydanny777> @rosemon5001 Not really, China's government often take opportunities to spread propaganda, which is what that is.
[2:48:08] <%AnIcedCoffee> Dunno where that delay offer thing came from, It's pretty widely known that Lucasarts wanted the game out during the Christmas rush.

[2:48:26] <%mikessdd> Sentinel are all I ever played lol
[2:48:27] <%0dokuro> @PatStaresAt When looking back at Knights of the Old Republic II in a 2013 interview, Avellone said that because of LucasArts forcing Obsidian to finish the game in a short time frame of 14 to 16 months, the game ended up being in an "unfinished" state. However, Avellone said that Obsidian was at fault for this due to not cutting out enough things; he noted that all minigames should have been removed, and also said that there were too many in-engine cutscenes.
[2:48:29] <%NichStachel> Yup Lulw , my B!
[2:48:31] <+OneGorillionDollars> KomodoHype
[2:48:31] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, they're the Scoundrel-equivalent from the first game
[2:48:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Bisexual Sentinals
[2:48:39] <Maleicus> then what did you think sentinels do
[2:48:45] <Grandma_Amari> Kae'ryn COULD use force persuade to make her expired coupon valid, but she'd rather force scream at the manager.

[2:50:54] <Coystick> I would like to talk to chat's manager
[2:50:54] <%0dokuro> @PatStaresAt -Due to this, several cuts had to be made; one of the most major was the droid planet M4-78, which was entirely removed from the game after the 2004 E3 event when the team realized that they wouldn't be able to fit it into the schedule

[2:53:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @krlos970 slightly less absurd than The Flash using a gun
[2:53:19] <%0dokuro> I know there's a lot of he said, she said around this game, but the best we can go off of it actual interviews of the team and leads which so far shows they were rushed.

[2:54:37] <dinnydanny777> @trickquestionz Is Sion the moustache man?
[2:54:39] <Coystick> Daily reminder that Avellone was against giving Nihilus any sort of a defined face but so much of the promo art ignored that directive hence Pat's banner image
[2:54:40] <%za7az> psaDogchamp
[2:54:57] <%QueequegTheater> @dinnydanny777 No, he's the edgy crusty boy
[2:55:06] <%mikessdd> Shield and the blasters don’t hurt. Sword so you can just direct damage droids through shields.
[2:55:09] <dan_g_v> so, is Pat going to stay up. to watch tomorrow's MonHun Direct?
[2:55:17] <KiryujiKazamoto> let's do, THIS?
[2:55:18] <%NichStachel> Now we’re mashin’ thru dialogues bois!
[2:55:24] <+GrassCannon> much faster
[2:55:27] <dinnydanny777> @queequegtheater Oh I remember now, the Scottish guy who spent too long in the sun?
[2:55:27] <Twiton> @dinnydanny777 I think not, but it was in my playthrough. I think it's dependant on if you have Handmaiden or not.
[2:55:28] <%chiazam> The damage enemies can do in this game are REAL, especially if they outnumber you
[2:55:30] <BaronVonProlix> Karens Yamato
[2:55:37] <%dekkitout> Like a hot knife through a baby- or whatever the saying is
[2:55:45] <%Anime_Flux> shhhh
[2:55:47] <kastev> Yea LUL
[2:55:48] <Twiton> If you have Handmaiden, Atris would be like "Damn I wish that were me."
[2:55:50] <dan_g_v> she's motivated!!

[2:56:37] <%NichStachel> True
[2:56:41] <%QueequegTheater> NO FUCK ON THAT
[2:56:48] <%mikessdd> Oh wow Pat chose the correct option.
[2:56:54] <%a_goth_pancake> next stop, telos. then... nar shadaa.
[2:56:55] <Twiton> RCM also makes it quicker to get HK, thanks to restored spawns of the 50 units being more frequent
[2:56:56] <%FacetiousAF> "i didn't mean to do that" - pat, who meant to do that
[2:57:00] <%dekkitout> A Jedi without a saber is more vulnerable than a child

[2:57:40] <%Anime_Flux> Isn't a Jedi without a lightsaber just Jean Grey?
[2:57:41] <kastev> @PatStaresAt So what's your end game goal for your character? Double Lightsabers? Staff? SIngle? Powers?
[2:57:47] <Twiton> Battle Simp would be Handmaiden
[2:57:47] <dinnydanny777> Why do Jedi die so often when they can literally see the future
[2:57:49] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt First feats should be cross-classing

[2:59:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> A huge power selection only does so much with the limited action economy. Deflect is at least passive
[3:00:00] <%anticrust> RIP pogchamp
[3:00:07] <%Agami23> is it as busted as it was in 1?
[3:00:08] <%QueequegTheater> Two EXTRA

[3:00:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's super good if you aren't using a lightsaber
[3:00:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> But the 2nd level of it gives like a +4 to deflect
[3:00:58] <+GrassCannon> some people really like gun
[3:00:58] <+Freakin_Wolfy> is pat doing laughably evil stuff yet?
[3:01:00] <Grandma_Amari> You don't HAVE to use a lightsaber
[3:01:01] <%CatastropheCorvid> IIRC
[3:01:04] <%anticrust> PogChamp
[3:01:07] <+bear_breaker20> stacks are neat
[3:01:09] <Grandma_Amari> You can use blasters if you want instead of a saber
[3:01:10] <Twiton> Kriea can be your support/speedy jedi for traveling
[3:01:13] <DatAsuna> zzz
[3:01:16] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Gun jedi tho
[3:01:23] <dinnydanny777> Is Kyle Katarn a gun Jedi?
[3:01:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Gun Jedi and Punch Jedi are totally viable in this game after all
[3:01:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Freedon Nadd's infinite blaster jutsu
[3:01:32] <Twiton> Force Redirection is very much for Blaster/Non-Lightsaber builds.
[3:01:34] <classicyeff> Pat would make a excellent leprechaun sith
[3:01:34] <%NichStachel> Nice

[3:02:06] <+Freakin_Wolfy> it stacks in the sense that it doesn't
[3:02:07] <silver__viii> I played gun jedi my last run of this and enjoyed it
[3:02:08] <%QueequegTheater> EVEN PATWAGON IS SMELLING
[3:02:15] <Twiton> Of course Karr Enn starts on the White Side
[3:02:15] <dan_g_v> wonderful

[3:03:31] <DestroyerPhoenix> FacetiousAF yup
[3:03:32] <%QueequegTheater> What if I like the first one? Is this a Pat opinion or real advice
[3:03:34] <DatAsuna> yes it's still peragus
[3:03:39] <fuji_92> chilli is a buff that can poison some ppl
[3:03:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> The 2nd level of Deflect stacks a +3 on deflect rolls

[3:06:12] <dinnydanny777> She thinks she's light side while doing dark side things
[3:06:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> Atris went to her Sith Holocron echo chamber to be reassured of her moral superiority, AKA her Facebook and Twitter
[3:06:22] <KaiserMario> Atris is like that one lady from Harry Potter, right? Umbridge or whatever...

[3:08:18] <dinnydanny777> I bet a game where you play as the old Star Wars Sith would be cool
[3:08:20] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt Karen's want employees to kill each other
[3:08:26] <%chiazam> Who willingly becomes a space coal miner
[3:08:31] <dinnydanny777> Like playing as the lizard man Sith

[3:09:20] <subjectg> @datasuna one of those “it’s a good show but it’s hyped up like the second coming of christ” kind of things?
[3:09:24] <Sotetsu> Is that a space katana?
[3:09:32] <Twiton> Yes
[3:09:37] <Twiton> It literally is
[3:09:38] <DatAsuna> @dinnydanny777 technically kotor 1/2 are the tail end of the old sith wars period lol but yes, a game in the ulic/exar years would be good
[3:09:42] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Are you aiming for a mostly optimal playthru, or are you trying not to worry about it so much?
[3:09:43] <tranquilturnip> love ma a good kay tana

[3:09:50] <%FacetiousAF> whoa whoa whoa.. KEE tana
[3:09:52] <+Fapbsi> so there are space japanese?
[3:09:53] <KiryujiKazamoto> space katana is space japanese for space sword
[3:09:54] <dan_g_v> i love the key than as
[3:09:54] <+Dunmarkh> A mining katana
[3:09:55] <$RealThiele> vibro
[3:09:57] <+Rezthryth123> when will we get a star wars game where I can be a mandalorian riding a basilisk droid dropping into orbit
[3:09:59] <s1rcuit> not only that it's a high frequency blade
[3:09:59] <%wibbwobbler> thats silly
[3:10:00] <Siconia> It's a VIBRATING space katana
[3:10:01] <%dekkitout> And she's wearing blue
[3:10:05] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Weaved from over 10,000 Corosis fibers
[3:10:05] <BaronVonProlix> i would prefer a space kopesh honetly
[3:10:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> Excuse me, it's called a Kei'Tahna
[3:10:16] <balthazar758> k tana
[3:10:19] <dan_g_v> a dildo space keytana?
[3:10:21] <%chiazam> Pat has no Little V guide
[3:10:24] <%Alazull> Space scimitar
[3:10:26] <KaiserMario> Great
[3:10:30] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @GeneralSCPatton LUL Dammit everyone's on fire tonight
[3:10:33] <DatAsuna> @Twiton there is a good comic series for that, you see stuff like the genocide of the cathar, the moment revan finds the mask, they manage to actually give malak an arc .etc
[3:10:36] <Sotetsu> Paaaaaat, can you and Paige do an Evangelion watch along? I want to hear your opinions and thoughts on each episode.
[3:10:37] <leinadtonu> mmmkay-tana
[3:10:47] <+GrassCannon> you were oom
[3:10:49] <+GrassCannon> well, oof
[3:10:58] <Xeraph619> wow you shoot lighting so early
[3:10:58] <%CatastropheCorvid> Dual sabers give you more bonii
[3:11:01] <%FacetiousAF> yo we bein tier 3 subs?
[3:11:03] <Siconia> Saber staff
[3:11:06] <KiryujiKazamoto> double blade
[3:11:09] <Huntercd> Yes Zangief we get it, you're a dog
[3:11:09] <%CatastropheCorvid> More potential add-ons when using two.
[3:11:11] <%FacetiousAF> i tier 3 sub pat, but only metaphorically
[3:11:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> hear me out, dual double bladed light saber
[3:11:14] <%maenos2> sith ar eall about the funky weird lightsabers
[3:11:15] <Twiton> @Twiton Those comics I hear are very good. Especially before TOR kinda pooped the bed
[3:11:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> Dual sabers means more crystal slots for stat buffs
[3:11:17] <DatAsuna> double ended/saber staff is bae
[3:11:17] <Badgerconda_> honestly, kotor 2 gets so easy once you get off peragus, you can pretty much do whatever you want just for style points, and still decimate everyone.
[3:11:17] <fuji_92> use 3 light sabers
[3:11:18] <%SolidusRex> DOOL WEELD
[3:11:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the biggest badass don't need lightsabers
[3:11:19] <%AzureGale> Is that doog I hear in the background
[3:11:20] <KaiserMario> Going for optimal makes it annoying, with all due respect to LittleV, it got pretty rough at some parts...
[3:11:22] <%mield916> pat, you missed stuff
[3:11:25] <%Agami23> are dualbladed lightsabers fixed in this one?
[3:11:26] <asylumkon> in any media the dual wielders are usually the bad guys
[3:11:26] <%Alazull> Dual wielding is good for extra stats
[3:11:26] <s1rcuit> @Sotetsu bro, they can't even play an award show that's meant to be shared without getting dmca'd
[3:11:27] <%dekkitout> A real sith would wait till they're long dead, their ghost possess someone, then puppet someone else
[3:11:30] <dinnydanny777> Karen is mastering the blade
[3:11:30] <RedSqurrl> I STARTED THIS THE OTHER DAY OMG <3
[3:11:32] <Admiral_PopnFresh> double sided more, I thing heroic more for 2 saber
[3:11:35] <%Aydarkzero> one lightsaber is all you need
[3:11:36] <Twiton> You can go dual, signle or double.
[3:11:37] <Javi9563> dual lightsaber with flurry and master speed is stupid but you gotta love it
[3:11:37] <susukouhai> dual sabers = big peepee energy
[3:11:37] <Blank9> how about 2 guns, the most evil sith thing ever
[3:11:41] <+BubbaRands> Go quad saber
[3:11:43] <Badgerconda_> go single lightsaber for style points, kotor 2 is easy anyway @PatStaresAt
[3:11:44] <subjectg> double bladed means double your good crystals rather than having to find more
[3:11:44] <%AzureGale> The only time Gief speaks is when he's not on the camera
[3:11:47] <AMUSERNAME> @PatStaresAt Do you think you can handle using a dual-blade, while knowing that two sabers is just plain better? Can you defeat that goblin??
[3:11:50] <%Alazull> But I like the idea of saber staff or single saber
[3:11:50] <%Anime_Flux> Boring conversation anyway....
[3:11:50] <%MechArch> the more you have the sithier you are
[3:11:53] <KiryujiKazamoto> one guy,. 6 lightsabers
[3:11:54] <dinnydanny777> She really does look like a Karen LUL
[3:11:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> So many stat boosting crystals. You want twice as many slots
[3:12:02] <%cylish> Two sabers is more power because double the mods in a double bladed saber
[3:12:13] <%maskedsongbird> I'm missing something here. What is "Tier 3 Sub" referring to? I haven't been on Twitch for very long (mostly just watched stream archives until recently).
[3:12:15] <dinnydanny777> The strange 2004 head movements kind of make her look even more like a Karen too LUL
[3:12:22] <Twiton> One Prestige Class is massively good for Dual
[3:12:30] <Twiton> It gets superior Dual Wielding
[3:12:30] <DatAsuna> @Twiton swtors also got plenty good stuff tbh, including links to those comics.
[3:12:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @maskedsongbird the mocking term or the actual thing?
[3:12:43] <%dekkitout> Karens are not new, the used to be known as soccer moms
[3:12:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @maskedsongbird you pay a little more for more access to emotes, or sometimes the ability to post links in chat
[3:12:53] <Sotetsu> This sounds like the batman theme
[3:13:08] <KiryujiKazamoto> @dekkitout well simps arent new either but that doesnt stop the memers
[3:13:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Sotetsu you right
[3:13:24] <Twiton> @Twiton I've seen a lot of issues with TOR, not just as a story but also a game, that makes it seem like I'd just end up sad going through it.
[3:13:26] <%maskedsongbird> @Sphincter_Spelunker Both.
[3:13:30] <%FacetiousAF> money psaGib
[3:13:36] <%dekkitout> Like a colloquial reverse half life
[3:13:37] <%maskedsongbird> Thanks Admiral, for the legit explanation.
[3:13:47] <%maskedsongbird> So what does the mocking variant imply?
[3:13:56] <s1rcuit> can he get hurt by his own mines?
[3:14:09] <Twiton> Dark Side Only gets screwed on Narshabda because the vendor for Dark Side is awful
[3:14:09] <+bighatbiglife> Don’t think so
[3:14:12] <$TallYoda08> Yes he can
[3:14:15] <subjectg> @s1rcuit nah, it’s for the dramatic
[3:14:16] <%Monkeyweed21> do those mines cure erectile dysfunction?
[3:14:27] <+OwlLightningMage> YOOO POGGERS IS GONE
[3:14:27] <+bluedude153> Is this the overthrow goverment chat
[3:14:28] <Twiton> While Lightside gets the great one that gets multiple item refreshes
[3:14:37] <Twiton> No
[3:14:38] <s1rcuit> @subjectg cool, tell him as well
[3:14:51] <+OwlLightningMage> TODAY HAS BEEN LIT LUL
[3:15:04] <%ClericOfSparda> PogChamp
[3:15:05] <Javi9563> yeah
[3:15:05] <%maskedsongbird> So since I'm a little late: is Pat going for a light side or dark side run?
[3:15:07] <Blank9> yeah
[3:15:08] <%CatastropheCorvid> yeah
[3:15:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> Sentinel gets a bunch of immunities and skill points
[3:15:09] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @maskedsongbird not sure, mocking variant of...?
[3:15:10] <subjectg> @s1rcuit eh, not too much of an issue
[3:15:10] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah
[3:15:22] <s1rcuit> @subjectg fair
[3:15:24] <Blank9> sentinel also gets passive anti-stun effects
[3:15:26] <%dekkitout> Pat's doing an Any% Karen run
[3:15:27] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @maskedsongbird dark
[3:15:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @maskedsongbird It's used colloquially as a substitute for twitch's ban of the word "simp". The actual use on the site is just donating more to the streamer with a single sub
[3:15:37] <%maskedsongbird> Mocking variant of "Tier 3 Subs."
[3:15:39] <DatAsuna> @Twiton depends how hung up you are on preconceptions tbh, if you carry a lot of baggage going in that always complicates things. I'd say the best thing it does is interesting master/apprentice dynamics and actually having characters give two sided exchanges on how to interpret the sith code .etc
[3:15:40] <%Agami23> @maskedsongbird going dark, he wants to be darth karen
[3:15:43] <%DigbyMayor> Hey I can't stay I just came to say mooka shaka paka
[3:15:49] <jibolbadoobies> PogU
[3:15:52] <ManfredA> are you doing a gun build Pat?
[3:16:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> now there's some crunchy textures
[3:16:08] <%GinAndRoses> beautiful grey cylinder
[3:16:09] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @maskedsongbird couldn't explain that, maybe just being ironic
[3:16:10] <%maskedsongbird> Got it, thanks.
[3:16:11] <Twiton> @Twiton Lightside Sith and Darkside Republic is a nice idea, I do like that.
[3:16:12] <DatAsuna> @Sphincter_Spelunker someone call the cops, they said the word
[3:16:15] <+wmeldrum> gief for pugchamp
[3:16:16] <Blank9> the rare gun jedi/sith
[3:16:23] <bigDEEforya> dat look like a bigo dil ..never mind
[3:16:32] <pilllowofbees> look at my space dild
[3:16:33] <Twiton> Oh no
[3:16:36] <ManfredA> gun jedi is not only viable in KotOR2, it's absurdly good
[3:16:38] <Twiton> Did Pat not use HD Blasters
[3:16:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> Sentinels acquire immunity to fear, stun, and paralysis by level 12
[3:16:47] <Twiton> Some Blasters look baaaaad
[3:16:49] <%dekkitout> @maskedsongbird I derives from a word that is for someone who overvalues a person that might be mediocre, for a shot at getting laid
[3:16:53] <$tehbeardedbard> was watching the gdq run of dmc 3 a bit ago made me miss you yelling at woole
[3:16:54] <Twiton> Yep, Crunchy
[3:16:59] <+PolarBear1071> Missed the start, why isnt he playing as a variant of Patron?
[3:17:01] <KiryujiKazamoto> 4 strength 4 stam leather belt?
[3:17:04] <%maskedsongbird> Dark Side Pat. So is he going to hole up in the back of the Ebon Hawk's storage area with his candy like a gremlin?
[3:17:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @DatAsuna D:
[3:17:34] <ManfredA> yeah you hit level cap quick in 2
[3:17:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @maskedsongbird I think in this context, using tier 3 sub in a mocking way is meant to make fun of people throwing away money on to get the funny-streamer-person to acknowledge them. A Tier 3 sub costs 5 times as much of a Tier 1 sub, at leat in the States
[3:17:37] <%baka_sugoi> Ow0
[3:17:42] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Karen does NOT have Charisma though
[3:17:44] <DatAsuna> @Twiton on the base level yeah, for the sith thing it's more about how much you value the idea of the sith as the ulitmate individual, or as the top of a supposed meritocracy
[3:17:48] <Vyskus> this soundtrack is etched into my soul
[3:17:49] <Javi9563> yes, if you are planning on going hard on powers
[3:17:50] <Blank9> you get shitloads of force powers
[3:17:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> Wis and Cha
[3:17:51] <%AzureGale> Sure
[3:17:55] <%wruce__billis> hey this music is pretty dangt good
[3:17:55] <%Retinolgaming> Karen charisma??
[3:18:02] <DatAsuna> the wisest karen
[3:18:14] <ape_hawk> pat, wisdom?? on a karen???
[3:18:19] <%jimjamstrawberryslamalam> If your going zappy wisdom
[3:18:19] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Karen HATES reisitance
[3:18:22] <%maskedsongbird> A wise Karen. Sounds like a paradox.
[3:18:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Have you thought about your prestige class already?
[3:18:24] <Javi9563> you can get through the whole game totally fine just spamming force storm, that shit is broken
[3:18:29] <Goodvibes99508> yes YOU will need heal to get through the game
[3:18:30] <%Anime_Flux> Karen's got a good spread...
[3:18:32] <%gyrwyrm> Hoi
[3:18:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Twiton I'd say the base game of SWTOR's Chapters 1, 2 and 3 is plenty to enjoy. It scratches an itch I had for Dragon Age and Mass Effect again
[3:18:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nice.
[3:18:46] <+chris_p_bacon684> I don’t change my pants either
[3:18:52] <%ssjklyco> Pats got high Karensma
[3:18:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> A good Karen build needs Wis to boost their Sense Manager skill
[3:18:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Sentinel/Lord lets you do the zappy while still having skills.
[3:18:59] <+Xelig> anyone else think game might be a little loud compared to pat voice?
[3:19:10] <KiryujiKazamoto> i loved throw lightsaber a a kid
[3:19:13] <DatAsuna> @Sphincter_Spelunker yeah and the fem agent is voiced by hawke/ and fem trooper by femshep :3
[3:19:23] <KiryujiKazamoto> gotta go fast
[3:19:27] <DestroyerPhoenix> speed is OP
[3:19:31] <Djinnazz> more turns
[3:19:32] <%a_goth_pancake> force push is great. when you level it up, you hold people in place while you zap them
[3:19:41] <%Ranryu692> master speed is mandatory
[3:19:42] <subjectg> Speed gives you more attacks
[3:19:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> SPEED sweetc2GoUp
[3:19:47] <Profmcstevie> A true karen has a great dash
[3:19:50] <%SomeSageAdvice> game's audio is just naturally quiet at times and then super loud other times, this is about as good as you'll get
[3:19:50] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Karen NEEEDs Force Scream
[3:19:52] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Karens are always quick to call upon the manager after all
[3:19:55] <%Monkeyweed21> speed is OP in every rpg
[3:19:59] <pilllowofbees> its busted
[3:20:01] <subjectg> master speed + rapid shot + dual blasters is cool
[3:20:03] <%chiazam> I AM SPEED
[3:20:04] <HealingMind> Is there basically any game where Extra attacks aren't at least high-tier as a perk?
[3:20:05] <%SomeSageAdvice> otherwise Pat would be adjusting sound constantly
[3:20:08] <Twiton> I like to be a trooper. I suppose I'm just waiting for TOR to have a QOL overhaul that doesn't make it so uh skeevy
[3:20:10] <$DocMadfox> Shit did I miss Pat bitching about SWTOR?
[3:20:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Just dual-wield Uber Falcon Blades at all times Pat.
[3:20:18] <Blank9> only light side would kindly shut off machines instead of kicking them
[3:20:19] <+buttdirt> you got some speed, man?
[3:20:20] <Twiton> Not yet
[3:20:27] <Twiton> I was just bitchin about TOR, DW
[3:20:30] <%SomeSageAdvice> surprisingly no, he said nothing about SWTOR
[3:20:43] <%dekkitout> Still no rant on why the true sith empire is big poop
[3:20:45] <%arancet> ow my eyes

[3:21:34] <DatAsuna> @Twiton what's the skeevy part? I will say i consider trooper the worst of the classe stories. Has cool ideas about the republic and military, but doesn't fully execute on them.
[3:21:35] <+PolarBear1071> man
[3:21:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You broke it.

[3:21:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It won't go off until you recast the power.
[3:21:52] <Klefth> Funny how they made a toggle for that one power lol
[3:21:54] <$DocMadfox> It has to wear off first
[3:22:00] <BoneBagMel> it's like watching something at 300 bitrate
[3:22:00] <DatAsuna> @Sphincter_Spelunker i like the idea of trooper chapter 1, but actually catching up to each of the traitors is underwhelming lol
[3:22:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Klefth That was added in an update.
[3:22:06] <%FluffiTamamo> go home motion blur, you're drunk.

[3:22:58] <%a_goth_pancake> oh it did
[3:23:00] <%mikessdd> A lovely abstract mosaic of the stream yes.
[3:23:02] <DracaenaLeaf> Wow this game really does hate gingers Kappa
[3:23:03] <%FacetiousAF> mmmmm
[3:23:03] <ManfredA> off-brand HK
[3:23:06] <%maskedsongbird> I liked that guy!

[3:23:11] <bigDEEforya> THIIICK
[3:23:12] <KaiserMario> It's like my stream went to 140p
[3:23:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Do not ruin the boy.
[3:23:15] <DatAsuna> don't watch mandalorian then
[3:23:15] <%FacetiousAF> hey. hey. pat. he's the wrong color Kappa
[3:23:16] <KiryujiKazamoto> well....
[3:23:19] <%a_goth_pancake> ah yes, the false HK
[3:23:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> on the other hand, I love his actor
[3:23:20] <subjectg> i liked the old camera angle better
[3:23:20] <%Agami23> wtf?? silver HK?
[3:23:23] <%twistedj3ster> IF HK WAS ON MANDO I WOULD SHIT MYSELF IN RAGE
[3:23:25] <$DocMadfox> He came back in Star Wars Galaxy and it was pretty dumb.
[3:23:27] <%NovaKnightmare> HK derivatives are in Mandalorian @PatStaresAt
[3:23:30] <%AzureGale> Yeyeyeye
[3:23:32] <%dekkitout> Clone Wars droids try to emulate from time to time
[3:23:33] <HeroToxiko> @DatAsuna SHUT UP
[3:23:33] <Javi9563> #notmyhk
[3:23:34] <%SociallyAwkwardToaster> I would 100% believe they will bring him pack in the mandalorian Kappa
[3:23:35] <Coystick> The one's in Mando are a nod at best
[3:23:38] <PinkSocks> this conversation with Woolie was a riot
[3:23:43] <KeiPrime> HK is in the mobile game
[3:23:48] <%Ynkubus_> Not the same HK type
[3:23:49] <KeiPrime> he doesnt say anything tho
[3:23:55] <%cylish> The mando ones also suck
[3:23:58] <DatAsuna> @HeroToxiko they did, that's one of the biggest problems
[3:24:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> to be fair, the mando show HKs look nothing like these
[3:24:02] <%Ranryu692> The closest we have to a modern HK is Triple Zero
[3:24:03] <%justcallmebobplease> Did y'all forget that the guard droids with that regent gal that Asoka was fighting, were called HKs?
[3:24:05] <Grandma_Amari> They didn't just kill him, they MINED HIM
[3:24:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He's fine in SWTOR.
[3:24:08] <HeroToxiko> the killdroid in mando is not an hk
[3:24:08] <KiryujiKazamoto> my leg!
[3:24:09] <%Nekros4442> Yep thats HK
[3:24:09] <%chiazam> He's the best droid character
[3:24:11] <DestroyerPhoenix> my HK tattoo will be evergreen, goddammit
[3:24:14] <LVL1_Scumbag> My leg!
[3:24:16] <bigDEEforya> WTF HAA
[3:24:17] <DatAsuna> mute HKs, the worst HKs
[3:24:20] <+TheBitingIrish> I kinda hope the sequel to Fallen Order is more 'Force Unleashed'
[3:24:22] <%mikessdd> Well yeah. It’s an HK-87
[3:24:25] <%Monkeyweed21> what a nice friendly droid
[3:24:25] <%chiazam> WHY DOES HE CALL YOU MASTER LMFAOOO
[3:24:26] <$DocMadfox> I love the HK series.
[3:24:26] <+TheBitingIrish> D:
[3:24:29] <%TaifuDragon> HK just means Hunter Killer, they're all HKs
[3:24:30] <Pillagius> Well that's rough...
[3:24:31] <HeroToxiko> @DatAsuna im pretty sure those are just
[3:24:33] <ner0romanov> when i first did this convo it went totally over my head that he can't possibly have this info if he wasn't the one who did it.
[3:24:37] <%dekkitout> I thought Mando had IG88 knockoffs, or does it also have HK knockoffs
[3:24:41] <pilllowofbees> thats fucked
[3:24:43] <DatAsuna> @Too_Much_Nukie 51/55 are p. good yeah
[3:24:52] <KaiserMario> That's a very Nic Cage performance
[3:24:53] <phoea> hk nutting over his own actions is too good
[3:24:57] <%mikessdd> In season 2.
[3:24:58] <%maskedsongbird> Man, the HKs are so very pleasant conversationalists. eh?
[3:25:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @bigDEEforya Oh man, is this the first time you're seeing HK? Because all his lines are pretty much like this and it's great
[3:25:05] <%mikessdd> They got HKs
[3:25:06] <bigDEEforya> why does the droid have more personality than karen ????
[3:25:07] <PinkSocks> So humble
[3:25:10] <Pillagius> It's kinda amusing how HK droids got bodied in Mandalorian... HK-47 would be disappointed...
[3:25:13] <Grandma_Amari> Violence is a form of communication Kappa
[3:25:13] <%Alazull> HK loves being evil
[3:25:15] <%Mr_Pylon> I love that HK was programmed to love the smell of his own farts
[3:25:30] <KiryujiKazamoto> facilitating communications and ending hostilities
[3:25:32] <%baka_sugoi> can ya sex the robot?
[3:25:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> smug protocols engaged
[3:25:35] <%a_goth_pancake> man, you can HEAR his shit eating grin.
[3:25:35] <HeroToxiko> those weren't hk droids in mando
[3:25:40] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There's some good fanfics with HK, Revan, and Malak.
[3:25:53] <%maskedsongbird> @Pillagius Well to be fair, it has been pointed out that every successive HK after 47 is an inferior droid.
[3:25:58] <%mikessdd> They were HK-87s. Name dropped in the show itself.
[3:25:59] <%za7az> Forever WutFace
[3:26:02] <ManfredA> HK models have the smug hardwired in
[3:26:11] <%Anime_Flux> He seems trustworthy
[3:26:12] <KiryujiKazamoto> new jedi, who dis?
[3:26:25] <HeroToxiko> if you pay attention to the scientist he says what those are and they are not hk's
[3:26:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> meat ba---, I mean organic
[3:26:28] <cumurasame> so has Pat been playing P5R off screen? If he ever gets to the finale I'd like to see it
[3:26:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> HK-47 was made in the star forge after all.
[3:26:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And everything else is just a shoddy copy.
[3:26:46] <phoea> terminate
[3:26:48] <%TheMattman1313> "terminate hostilities"
[3:26:49] <ManfredA> very specific terms
[3:26:59] <dinnydanny777> Is there smoke coming out of HK
[3:27:04] <%a_goth_pancake> @herotoxiko in episode 13, not the finale.
[3:27:16] <%mikessdd> Is someone mistaking the Dark troopers with the HKs in the Ahsoka episode?
[3:27:21] <%a_goth_pancake> the ones that hung out with Michael Biehn.
[3:27:25] <%maskedsongbird> If we ever build intelligent robots and AI, we NEED to install a means of simulating the same level of smugness. DOWNLOAD: Shiteatinggrin.exe
[3:27:29] <DestroyerPhoenix> cascade failure, eh Keepo
[3:27:35] <leinadtonu> you got bonked

[3:28:41] <+megaman_sentinel> so trustworthy lol
[3:28:54] <%maskedsongbird> @dinnydanny777 Oh, good idea! Just give the paperclip a robot body and we're all set.
[3:28:55] <+ThankYourLocalEgg> PogChamp
[3:28:58] <%a_goth_pancake> would jedi wine be more or less potent than arbor mist wine from Walmart?

[3:29:58] <KiryujiKazamoto> the Epic Cock
[3:30:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> LUL
[3:30:02] <HeroToxiko> wasn't hk a different colour
[3:30:02] <DestroyerPhoenix> Agami23 no, this is HK-50
[3:30:07] <+GrassCannon> @Agami23 He's the wrong color. He's black.
[3:30:08] <%Monkeyweed21> HK stands for Helper Kuddler @PatStaresAt
[3:30:09] <ape_hawk> not all HKs are the same
[3:30:11] <Badgerconda_> rrrrusty rrred
[3:30:11] <KiryujiKazamoto> 51
[3:30:13] <ape_hawk> 50

[3:30:14] <KiryujiKazamoto> or 50
[3:30:14] <%dekkitout> 51 or some shit
[3:30:15] <%cylish> I think 47 is just rusty
[3:30:15] <+Invaderjaymz> is there a list of the mods used?
[3:30:15] <+TheBitingIrish> It's just a dye job
[3:30:15] <ManfredA> 51

[3:30:16] <walnutcast> 69 hehehhe
[3:30:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Dova573 he's playing as Karen
[3:30:16] <Blackjack760> hmmmm
[3:30:16] <%Agami23> ohhhhhh
[3:30:17] <trickquestionz> In the words of Woolie: "This HK is the wrong color."
[3:30:17] <Coystick> RUSTY ORANGE
[3:30:17] <Halospaz117> 50
[3:30:19] <Javi9563> 50
[3:30:19] <%Ranryu692> 50
[3:30:21] <%AtomicHeartSon> This is HK-51 Pat
[3:30:22] <DatAsuna> no this is 50
[3:30:22] <KiryujiKazamoto> i cant keep up
[3:30:24] <+Gespens> HKs are always ZANY
[3:30:24] <%chiazam> Uh what bounty
[3:30:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @GrassCannon V noooooo
[3:30:25] <%Retinolgaming> HK-50
[3:30:27] <DatAsuna> 51 is swtor
[3:30:29] <%chiazam> Ummmmmm
[3:30:31] <%SharkMissile> A later, vastly inferior model
[3:30:31] <%justcallmebobplease> HK-51 is mod restoration content only, in the HK factory
[3:30:32] <%chiazam> HK
[3:30:33] <ManfredA> nah 47's paint coat is intentional, he brings it up later
[3:30:34] <%a_goth_pancake> hk-47 = goat. hk-50 = punk ass bitch.
[3:30:36] <+Dova573> oh no Darth karen?!
[3:30:37] <%SociallyAwkwardToaster> this one's 50, 51 and 55 were in SWTOR
[3:30:39] <%dekkitout> They must get logarithmically worse as they increase
[3:30:40] <%justcallmebobplease> You only run into HK-50s in the base game
[3:30:43] <Javi9563> 51s are new ones that you can construct in another quest near the end of the game, and are in swtor
[3:30:46] <DatAsuna> @atomicheartson no this is 50
[3:30:50] <%justcallmebobplease> ...I mean, besides the OG boy
[3:30:52] <Coystick> did the VA ever do anything outside of HK?
[3:30:56] <%Rain_Mage> I love how they're standing over dead bodies
[3:31:00] <%Monkeyweed21> HK stands for Hugger Kuddler
[3:31:03] <+megaman_sentinel> were
[3:31:13] <ChungusQuest> @PatStaresAt Would you say he shares certain vocal qualities with Garak? Very smarmy.
[3:31:21] <Coystick> Hugs & Kisses-47
[3:31:21] <DatAsuna> @coystick he's also one of the jedi council in swtor
[3:31:27] <%AtomicHeartSon> @DatAsuna You're totally right my bad.
[3:31:37] <+Dova573> I wish could speak half as decent like this in real life
[3:31:37] <%dekkitout> @Monkeyweed21 Light Side HK is a defender of the galaxy and friend to all children
[3:31:37] <Blank9> fuck, garak's so good
[3:31:47] <ManfredA> @PatStaresAt I love that even other Sith considered Revan a big weirdo for making a droid assassin with a sense of humor
[3:31:50] <s1rcuit> the HK series does it's job well, but have the subtlety of an AK
[3:31:52] <+Nymphonomicon> Gareth Gobblecock?
[3:31:54] <Sapphire_Breeze> accidents huh
[3:32:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @DatAsuna also that politician who totally wasn't evil
[3:32:15] <bigDEEforya> just like karens to gossip
[3:32:22] <KiryujiKazamoto> he loves it!
[3:32:24] <subjectg> Perfectly timed, well-executed accidents
[3:32:24] <trickquestionz> FLAWLESSLY TIMED
[3:32:36] <Coystick> Oooh HK VA is in Dishonored too, I forgot
[3:32:36] <%Mr_Pylon> he loves it so
[3:32:38] <s1rcuit> he can't not flex
[3:32:39] <%dekkitout> He strides on subtlety
[3:32:40] <AMUSERNAME> EFFICIENTLY
[3:32:41] <KiryujiKazamoto> man whoever did this BIG CRIME must have been SUPER COOL
[3:32:43] <+TheBitingIrish> He fucking loves his job
[3:32:43] <%YakumoYomi> Sadly
[3:32:50] <%a_goth_pancake> he is just furiously stroking that ego
[3:32:52] <Javi9563> he loves it
[3:32:52] <mihokspawn> Oh what is this? KOTOR2... MessaJarJar, meesaaa happy
[3:32:53] <%Darthwaffler> Darthwaffler subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 20 month streak! MY PC died so I was gone for a while, now I'm back!
[3:32:53] <trickquestionz> Woolie and Little V lost their shit at that too.
[3:32:53] <+Gespens> These droids are so evil, they probably somehow got the Dark Side of the force going in them

[3:33:18] <ner0romanov> lol the Humble Brag
[3:33:18] <%justcallmebobplease> Honestly? The Old Republic being organizationally unable to grasp that these 'protocol droids' are sus as fuck is proof they deserved to collapse.
[3:33:19] <%chiazam> Oh HE'S the one who did it
[3:33:19] <%maskedsongbird> "I don't know who killed these guys, but he must have been devastatingly handsome!"
[3:33:20] <KaiserMario> Statement: I have calibrations to perform, master.
[3:33:22] <%YakumoYomi> Unrivaled sophistication!
[3:33:24] <AMUSERNAME> HIGHLY UNLIKELY
[3:33:27] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> that is too much detail

[3:56:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt I'm surprised we didn't turn the AI on the avi files
[3:56:30] <+zagryl> sleepybois

[3:56:41] <%dekkitout> GET SOME FUCKING COCOA BUTTER ON YO ELBOWS
[3:56:42] <rsg220> I bet he's a sith man
[3:56:43] <+TheBitingIrish> Does he? DansGame
[3:56:47] <rsg220> just you watch
[3:56:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Why are none of the movie villains as cool as Darth Sion?
[3:56:48] <%whyskeywolfe> It annoys me that there are children who have never seen life in the Standard Def.
[3:56:50] <%Agami23> thats a crusty looking boy
[3:56:50] <KiryujiKazamoto> he looks light sidce
[3:56:51] <%shurtal> I'm so angry, i refuse to die
[3:56:52] <%YakumoYomi> Ya'll got the lotion ready?
[3:56:54] <KiryujiKazamoto> side*

[3:56:59] <%Nekros4442> get this man some vvaseline
[3:56:59] <%dekkitout> This guy is so dry
[3:57:01] <%faintsmile> damn he needs to hydrate

[3:57:02] <Huntercd> That is a zombie
[3:57:04] <%DappercatEsquire> PUT ON SOME LOTION DUDE
[3:57:04] <Javi9563> man literally too angry to die
[3:57:04] <mihokspawn> hot evil... or EVIL HOTNESS????
[3:57:05] <%AzureGale> Is that The Thing after he goes on a diet
[3:57:05] <%chiazam> Look at this mf
[3:57:08] <%SomeSageAdvice> man literally too angry to die
[3:57:10] <trickquestionz> This is something I always wondered, how is the ship flying if everyone is dead and why aren't they being smashed apart by the asteroids?
[3:57:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> he's made out of the banned word for the female exile
[3:57:10] <CrypticMochi> Darth Crusty Boi
[3:57:12] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Boo
[3:57:13] <phoea> vadar with no suit
[3:57:14] <KaiserMario> He looks like he's full of bees
[3:57:14] <Badgerconda_> eldritch abomination sith are the coolest sith
[3:57:14] <%arancet> i want him to just be the nicest guy
[3:57:15] <+PolarBear1071> the true anger gremlin, literally held together by his spite to not die
[3:57:15] <%FacetiousAF> and ONE JEDI is the coolest jedi
[3:57:20] <DayDayMaccin1> Darth Nihilus especially
[3:57:21] <%Romuken> so chonky
[3:57:23] <+PenmanLupine> he's not that cool, he's easily defeated with some lotion
[3:57:23] <Paciboyy> Nihilus is fucking dumb, hard disagree
[3:57:24] <%FacetiousAF> we HEARD it
[3:57:25] <%Too_Much_Nukie> R-r-remix!
[3:57:26] <%CrowbarFacelift> oh god
[3:57:28] <%nobleclonetrooper> Only Nihilus and T****. Sion is.... kinda lame tbh.
[3:57:29] <%mikessdd> Darth “sleeps with vibroblades”
[3:57:30] <%AnIcedCoffee> I used to be such a huge stan for Nihilus's design when I was younger
[3:57:31] <%toolofparanoia> STAR JANK
[3:57:32] <CursedNobleman> But Darth Christopher Lee is the coolest guy :(
[3:57:32] <%cvp5127> psaDogchamp
[3:57:33] <%dekkitout> No one tops Abaloth for weird evil
[3:57:34] <$RealThiele> krr krr krr
[3:57:35] <%a_goth_pancake> darth nihilus is goat
[3:57:36] <KiryujiKazamoto> Nihilus is dumb and he is the greatest
[3:57:39] <%juxtest> Hes clearly a harmless priest, look at him give last rights to those dead Republic crewmen
[3:57:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt so out of the 3 which one ar eyou the most like
[3:57:40] <%democrazyyy> nihilus is the COOLEST
[3:57:40] <El_GhostV1> Does body cream weaken him
[3:57:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Darth Sion is kind of a bitch-baby, tbh. Super cool design though
[3:57:41] <DestroyerPhoenix> @Paciboyy but like, in a cool way, like broly
[3:57:43] <%wibbwobbler> dark side wouldn't be so bad if it made you hot
[3:57:47] <trickquestionz> The Sith in this game are the coolest because they're basically Lovecraftian abominations instead of supervillains
[3:57:47] <AnacondaVirtue> Oh boy
[3:57:52] <rsg220> see that fat astronaut, that's the hero
[3:57:55] <Badgerconda_> Nihilus is so fucking cool!
[3:57:59] <Javi9563> nihilus literally gives the succ to whole planets
[3:58:02] <%walternatorz> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[3:58:03] <fuji_92> what

[3:58:08] <$DocMadfox> The dog or the character?
[3:58:08] <%democrazyyy> haha he hongry
[3:58:08] <%TheBensonator_> Nihilus is tops
[3:58:08] <DayDayMaccin1> Nihilus Is dope asf
[3:58:09] <+TomDanksEGOT> your dog?
[3:58:10] <%nobleclonetrooper> Sion's completely pointless and an abhorrent child. "I wanna be the favorite wah!"
[3:58:10] <%chiazam> Nihilus is so fucking based
[3:58:11] <+Cityscape17> your puppers is a sith lord? maybe for apples
[3:58:12] <%YakumoYomi> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[3:58:12] <phoea> eldritch noises
[3:58:13] <KaiserMario> Vaccum hands?
[3:58:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You aren't wrong
[3:58:14] <Zombrocom> Thought about it. Don't get it,
[3:58:15] <%Ranryu692> the weight of his poops would end worlds
[3:58:17] <+thatotherblackkid> ??????
[3:58:19] <%SirGO0SE> 4Head
[3:58:19] <%AzureGale> A sith lord that bleps and wants food all the time?
[3:58:19] <%mikessdd> CONSUME ALL
[3:58:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> yes. we're the idiots
[3:58:21] <+RyTYoung> LUL
[3:58:22] <%dekkitout> Darth Maw, the Consumer
[3:58:23] <redrins> consume
[3:58:25] <+GeneralGray8> Zangief is at best a sith apprentice imo
[3:58:26] <rsg220> Oh, I though you meant Zangief, the senator
[3:58:26] <%twoto858> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[3:58:26] <%whyskeywolfe> It's important this cut scene is 60 seconds long.
[3:58:27] <%cylish> Is Nihilus just kirby?
[3:58:27] <KaiserMario> Oh, hungry boy...
[3:58:28] <Commander_Spyke> Omg I made it in time for the best KOTOR game pvpPAYAYA
[3:58:29] <fuji_92> oh
[3:58:29] <%RetroCop87> I can picture him doing that Palpatine air spin to grab Paige's apple
[3:58:30] <%TheBensonator_> NOM
[3:58:34] <%a_goth_pancake> psaDogcham psaGiefrail
[3:58:35] <%chiazam> No fuck you Pat the name is your fault
[3:58:43] <$RealThiele> inject\
[3:58:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Now Im gonna have nightmares of puppy zang eating the world kirby style
[3:58:48] <+Gespens> But is his dick out 24/7?
[3:58:50] <%Pyr0_Fr0st> Nihilus with a blep?
[3:58:51] <+zagryl> My boy might just have a tapeworm
[3:58:51] <%Agami23> elmo would probably be a good sith lord. grumpy boy
[3:58:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That docking cutscene is too long.
[3:58:53] <Zudrag> Kreygasm
[3:58:54] <+PolarBear1071> Nihilus is just evil kirby, yes
[3:58:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> HE HAS CUM
[3:58:55] <%DemonOfSalt> Zangief does have an insatiable thirst for food and is possessive of the most important female figure in his life. Checks out.
[3:58:55] <KiryujiKazamoto> Lewd
[3:58:57] <%democrazyyy> @retrocop87 that image is incredible
[3:58:59] <+Cityscape17> thats what she said
[3:59:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> and so have I
[3:59:01] <%Dakuu75> GOOD RUN
[3:59:01] <Sunstalker> Hey, pat. Check out the new criminal, Via Getty, on twitter later. You'll have a good laugh.
[3:59:01] <TheNewJapanGuy> LUL'
[3:59:02] <%Visorak6> oh lawd he cummin
[3:59:02] <%twoto858> That run cycle is goofy
[3:59:03] <%baka_sugoi> tip tap
[3:59:03] <%TheBensonator_> w a d d l e
[3:59:05] <%shurtal> The time has come, and so has he.
[3:59:05] <%AnIcedCoffee> If blepping = what he said to the Jedi before he lifewiped their planet
[3:59:05] <%Dakuu75> nice waddle
[3:59:09] <KiryujiKazamoto> can i has cummies Sion daddy?
[3:59:09] <%AzureGale> Ewwwww, Sith lords coming D:
[3:59:10] <%baka_sugoi> weeeeeeeeeeeee
[3:59:10] <+TheBitingIrish> omfg I just tabbed in and what is this walk cycle
[3:59:11] <+eXtwofour> lmao
[3:59:11] <%whyskeywolfe> This run annihilates the tension from the previous scene
[3:59:13] <+RaziWraith> wtf is this walk animation? LUL
[3:59:16] <Huntercd> That waddle is adorable
[3:59:19] <%ZephynM> I wonder how AWESOME this part of the game would be if you moved any slower LUL
[3:59:19] <+PolarBear1071> Step on the gas
[3:59:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> Look its pats normal walk cycle
[3:59:25] <%Cral_Senpai> psaGib
[3:59:28] <%Retinolgaming> Darth Nhilius is just Kirby outside of a nintendo setting
[3:59:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's the slow walk animation from KOTOR 1 just sped up.
[3:59:30] <%mikessdd> Super fast tippy toes.
[3:59:32] <%chiazam> Someday Pat will have something to say about Zangief from Street Fighter and we won't know WHAT THE FUCK he's talking about
[3:59:35] <jimmytwofeet> EWWW STINKY
[3:59:35] <Commander_Spyke> Has Pat played this before?
[3:59:38] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Fun fact, this is super slow in the vanilla game, the Restored Content Patch speeds it up because it's a huge pain
[3:59:41] <%TheMattman1313> What if we just throw a rock at the glass bridge there?
[3:59:48] <+skm742> isn't it an underwater walk animation sped up?
[3:59:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Valentinius_Anodyne Wrong, that's vanilla.
[3:59:57] <%a_goth_pancake> shit, more droids.
[4:00:01] <%Dakuu75> @Commander_Spyke pretty sure he has... i'm like 80% sure
[4:00:19] <KiryujiKazamoto> Corpse is sus
[4:00:25] <%arancet> but pat... autopause!
[4:00:26] <%mikessdd> Feel my Flurry!
[4:00:28] <Commander_Spyke> @valentinius_anodyne Nah that run cycle was fixed specifically from Kotor1, restored content doesn't do anything to it
[4:00:38] <%ZephynM> I used to love KOTR on Xbox, but idk if I'd be able to play it again these days
[4:00:50] <%ZephynM> Super glad I can watch :D
[4:00:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Oh yes!
[4:01:01] <%Dakuu75> Man, EVERYTHING that could've gone wrong, went wrong, for that guy
[4:01:15] <Commander_Spyke> KOTOR 2 is def worth playing. The writing is top notch
[4:01:16] <CursedNobleman> ehh, these sorta walky RPGs like dragon age havent aged super well
[4:01:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It turns out that I misremembered, now it is my balls that have been exposed
[4:01:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Those dumb insulated gloves are too good for how early they are.
[4:01:29] <ironoverloaded> Anyone know what Pat's using to play this? Only my xbox original works reliably.
[4:01:39] <%AzureGale> One day Pat will be talking about Zangief's green fist, we'll think the dog got in some paint, and Pat will say "no, I meant the Street Fighter character"
[4:01:45] <%maskedsongbird> @Dakuu75 And thus the Force did say: "Fuck that dude in particular."
[4:01:46] <CursedNobleman> steam im guessing?
[4:01:46] <fuji_92> damage... Resistence
[4:01:48] <phoea> i just got some cookies :)
[4:01:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @ironoverloaded Restored Content Mod with the PC version
[4:01:52] <%VoidBaronJules> @ironoverloaded Pv
[4:01:56] <KiryujiKazamoto> sword get longer
[4:01:56] <%mikessdd> @ironoverloaded steam version
[4:02:01] <Admiral_PopnFresh> YEP
[4:02:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The steam version was patched like 2 years ago and runs well now.
[4:02:05] <+Kaiserzelcor> You gonna try out the YS9 demo?
[4:02:11] <KiryujiKazamoto> when Yu Yu Hakusho GT>
[4:02:11] <%a_goth_pancake> @ironoverloaded restored content mod on steam
[4:02:27] <ironoverloaded> I'll have to give it another shot. 10/10 for opting for restored content.
[4:02:29] <%mikessdd> Yeah GoG doesn’t have the widescreen patch and sucks.
[4:02:31] <jimmytwofeet> IS DA FOGG
[4:02:42] <CursedNobleman> its a crime that DBZ is so much more popular than yuyuhakusho. yuyu has better waifus for one thing
[4:02:50] <Commander_Spyke> Restored Content is pretty nice
[4:02:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @KiryujiKazamoto it's called Hunter x HUnter
[4:02:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Is the workshop version of RCM up to date?
[4:02:58] <%Dakuu75> will those mines 1-shot you?
[4:02:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I think it is.
[4:03:02] <%QueequegTheater> Hunter Ecks Hunter
[4:03:04] <+Gespens> With PogChamp dead, it's time to push KomodoHype
[4:03:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Good.
[4:03:07] <%a_goth_pancake> I hate this room.
[4:03:12] <KiryujiKazamoto> Hunter cross Hunter
[4:03:15] <%mikessdd> Oh and if you’re having a weird Character stuck in place after combat. Just lock the FPS to 60 using Nvidia’s control panel.
[4:03:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ecks dee
[4:03:37] <+thatotherblackkid> I thought RCM was Nexus only
[4:03:38] <%Retinolgaming> Mr Freeze gun
[4:03:43] <ironoverloaded> What difficulty he got this on?
[4:03:46] <Halospaz117> Yeah, workshop is the most convenient way to mod, but I'm pretty sure there are more mods available via manual install
[4:03:53] <%Kurgash> Kurgash subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Yay more Star Wars. It’s ironic as getting to watch our democracy almost die to the sound of thunderous applause earlier today.
[4:03:53] <%a_goth_pancake> @patstaresat do you have the lightsaber colors mod?
[4:03:56] <%mikessdd> RCM is in the steam workshop
[4:03:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Kaiserzelcor Ah dang, when you said that I got hyped but it turns out that it's Playstation only, here's hoping the PC version wasn't as much of a mess as Ys8 was
[4:04:00] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Pump up the jam, pump it up while your feet are stomping
[4:04:12] <KiryujiKazamoto> color mod ruins bronze
[4:04:15] <+TheBitingIrish> Pat, the game sound is drowning you out a little
[4:04:17] <CursedNobleman> @Kurgash yay democray? :)
[4:04:19] <ChungusQuest> Has it been mentioned in the current pogstorm that DSP nominated himself as the new face for the emote?
[4:04:20] <%Dakuu75> little hard to hear Pat talk when shit is going happening
[4:04:23] <%Agami23> dude, i can barely hear you over the music
[4:04:25] <%a_goth_pancake> Kreygasm
[4:04:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Bronze was always bad tho
[4:04:30] <+Skelegroove> It's the music
[4:04:32] <fuji_92> one guy
[4:04:32] <%N0bdyNoOne> Game volume seems super loud, was that just me
[4:04:34] <Halospaz117> Sounds fine to me
[4:04:35] <KiryujiKazamoto> or ruins orange, it ruins one of them
[4:04:37] <%Monkeyweed21> its the music
[4:04:38] <+Delenay> its got some high highs
[4:04:38] <%ssjklyco> You're fine.
[4:04:39] <%DemonOfSalt> Just music.
[4:04:41] <Laecerelius> Yeah the battle music was going a bit fucking nuts
[4:04:44] <jimmytwofeet> how do you not hear.....THE BOIVIN
[4:04:44] <%dekkitout> Say it with your chest BabyRage
[4:04:46] <%mikessdd> Yeah it’s specifically just the music.
[4:04:46] <%snow_bush> Game volume is fine
[4:04:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> can you audio compress like you did with DS3?
[4:04:47] <AMUSERNAME> MUSIC and SFX DOWN, Voices UP! LUL
[4:04:48] <$DocMadfox> It's the music and the lightning.
[4:04:49] <DatAsuna> welcome to kotor 2
[4:04:50] <%twistedj3ster> BGM was loud but I feared being One Guy
[4:04:51] <+TheBitingIrish> HA
[4:04:53] <%mikessdd> Battle music anyway
[4:04:55] <KiryujiKazamoto> i love bronze because Freedon Nadd
[4:04:56] <DestroyerPhoenix> honestly i like the music being at this volume lol
[4:05:03] <$spardanwarrior> Williaaams! *shakes fist*
[4:05:03] <%za7az> It's just the music
[4:05:04] <Twiton> Steam's Workshop RCM conflicts with any non-Workshop mod
[4:05:07] <%a_goth_pancake> but it improves silver and viridian.
[4:05:09] <%AzureGale> You can save Cloud in this game, what?
[4:05:09] <ironoverloaded> Just the music and sfx for blasters yes, a little. It's great, but we wanna hear you lol
[4:05:10] <Grandma_Amari> It was mostly the blaster fire drowning you out
[4:05:11] <DatAsuna> yeah you have to save local for infiniyr slots
[4:05:12] <KiryujiKazamoto> his name is the LAMEST, it's the COOLEST
[4:05:16] <+TheBitingIrish> Just a notch or two would be good
[4:05:20] <+reallybigrocks> It's all about that DYNAMIC RANGE baby
[4:05:20] <%Dakuu75> I felt like it was the sound effects more but, that's me.
[4:05:28] <%za7az> psaBig Pat
[4:05:31] <%a_goth_pancake> psaBig psaLiz
[4:05:32] <DatAsuna> @AzureGale based aspyr
[4:05:33] <jimmytwofeet> He's going to ban me
[4:05:34] <Twiton> So you have to go to DeadlyStream to get RCM if you want any of the non-Workshop mods
[4:05:46] <DestroyerPhoenix> tbh i like the base game orange crystal color because of the red core it had
[4:06:07] <%WhereIsWill> ooh cool wallpaper pat
[4:06:07] <%whyskeywolfe> Next try flushing the server-side cache IP.
[4:06:08] <ironoverloaded> ... Is that a poster of Steve Buscemi behind Pat?
[4:06:10] <KiryujiKazamoto> no :)
[4:06:12] <%Agami23> only way to know is gonna be combat.
[4:06:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no :)
[4:06:15] <%DappercatEsquire> no
[4:06:17] <+TomDanksEGOT> sounds better still pretty loud
[4:06:18] <%Monkeyweed21> good streamies
[4:06:18] <%AzureGale> ok
[4:06:18] <SuperChumps> It's still pretty loud @PatStaresAt
[4:06:20] <%baka_sugoi> woolieMIRIN
[4:06:21] <+TheBitingIrish> Maybe, idk
[4:06:21] <%chiazam> Sound is good
[4:06:21] <%FacetiousAF> you can't trust us for shit
[4:06:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> no
[4:06:27] <%za7az> No :)
[4:06:27] <%Visorak6> probably not but hey well try
[4:06:28] <%a_goth_pancake> If I'm not mistaken, the color mod guy made another mod that changes all of them but bronze.
[4:06:32] <%Ranryu692> the part of the sound where it's your voice is pretty terrible
[4:06:35] <%dekkitout> That music will not be defeated
[4:06:36] <jimmytwofeet> you trust CHAT?
[4:06:40] <+megaman_sentinel> this too much power Karen
[4:06:43] <+TomDanksEGOT> TALK PAT!
[4:06:43] <NeroInfinite> I'm watchin in 360 P so I can't tell a difference.
[4:06:43] <%VoidBaronJules> didn't work
[4:06:44] <+TheBitingIrish> Pat, you have to talk
[4:06:47] <s1rcuit> @ironoverloaded no, it's a PORTRAIT of Steve Buscimi
[4:06:47] <Blank9> didn't change anything from what I hear
[4:06:47] <NeroInfinite> :)
[4:06:49] <%Dakuu75> still loud
[4:06:50] <Grandma_Amari> Gotta talk to hear if it drowns you out
[4:06:50] <%twistedj3ster> YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
[4:06:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> slightly not as loud, still loud
[4:06:51] <%Agami23> pretty much
[4:06:51] <+Delenay> kinda just as loud
[4:06:51] <%chiazam> @Ranryu692 I agree
[4:06:52] <%N0bdyNoOne> Yes
[4:06:52] <ironoverloaded> It's not as loud, no.
[4:06:54] <+TheBitingIrish> It's a LITTLE better
[4:06:55] <%N0bdyNoOne> Still far to loud
[4:06:57] <%DappercatEsquire> tell us a story
[4:07:00] <%TheBensonator_> pew pew
[4:07:01] <%baka_sugoi> battle ost be loud
[4:07:02] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> its the same
[4:07:03] <Laecerelius> Not as loud but still pretty loud
[4:07:04] <%za7az> YOU HAVE TO TALK
[4:07:05] <%dekkitout> The highs are high on my speakers, it's slightly better
[4:07:06] <%chiazam> Its the same
[4:07:06] <%mikessdd> Oh pat you sound louder. But yeah the bgm seems about the same.
[4:07:06] <%Visorak6> still loud
[4:07:15] <ironoverloaded> @s1rcuit Why am I surprised???
[4:07:16] <+Skelegroove> This game just has terrible audio mixing
[4:07:20] <%N0bdyNoOne> Compress me daddy
[4:07:21] <CSeriesJTYPE> isnt there literally a volume slider in OBS
[4:07:22] <%mikessdd> Pat sounds louder. But yeah bgm sounds the same.
[4:07:24] <%a_goth_pancake> psaBig psaSmug
[4:07:26] <derangedoutcast> my poor ears
[4:07:26] <%chiazam> psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon
[4:07:28] <ThatGuyThere03> Wait he still has EGS installed?
[4:07:30] <KiryujiKazamoto> supress the proletariat
[4:07:30] <Twiton> Steam version can be difficult to mod due to the directory causing an issue IIRC. The GOG version lacks the update/patch, but I've had an easier time modding it.
[4:07:31] <TheZearGuy> Turn down 30%?
[4:07:32] <%mighty_max_t> *shit compression intensifies*
[4:07:36] <%chiazam> psaBig psaHoldon
[4:07:37] <scrublord009> WHEN'S BLOODBOWL?
[4:07:38] <%VoidBaronJules> woo new tech unlocked
[4:07:40] <%TheBensonator_> Gets rid of background noise/hissing
[4:07:40] <jimmytwofeet> LIMIT THAT FUCK TO -12DB
[4:07:41] <%a_goth_pancake> wait where's
[4:07:42] <s1rcuit> @ironoverloaded because you've got some growing to do
[4:07:43] <+Nymphonomicon> Tiny man crushes sound to appease the many voices in his head.
[4:07:46] <%walternatorz> oh no, I can't hear paige
[4:07:48] <%SomeSageAdvice> noise supression only prevents outside noise
[4:07:52] <+LionKagura> its for background noise
[4:07:52] <KiryujiKazamoto> "Misc" we all know that's Overwatch porn
[4:07:53] <+reallybigrocks> Compression is probably just gonna make the quiet parts more even to the louder parts, limiter would be closer to what you want
[4:07:53] <%Dakuu75> that's just for like, static-noise/ background noise when your mic activates.
[4:07:55] <%Littlecjmajor> thats a pretty background
[4:07:57] <%WhereIsWill> pat cant obs guys you know this Kappa
[4:08:06] <%TheBensonator_> Prevents sounds from fans, air conditioners, 60-cycle hum, etc.
[4:08:07] <+TomDanksEGOT> you sound like a chipmunk
[4:08:07] <%Monkeyweed21> hissing
[4:08:10] <CSeriesJTYPE> isnt there just a desktop audio volume slidere
[4:08:18] <%za7az> Suppresses noise? KappaHD
[4:08:26] <+Skaphel> if you remove the background noise then we wont be able to hear pat
[4:08:33] <ancrest_tant> Limiter is just a hard compressor
[4:08:36] <%twistedj3ster> Pat just use the in game settings and cut it by 35%
[4:08:37] <%a_goth_pancake> KomodoHype big paaaaat
[4:08:39] <KiryujiKazamoto> compression makes quiter louder, limiter make louder quiet
[4:08:41] <%SomeSageAdvice> give it a go, might work
[4:08:53] <%dekkitout> Limiters: on
[4:08:54] <@StridentSong> psaHoldon
[4:08:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @twistedj3ster He did, the game is just like this.
[4:08:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it's KomodoHype 's time to shine
[4:08:56] <%VoidBaronJules> gg
[4:08:56] <%AzureGale> AND THIS TO GO FURTHER BEYOND
[4:08:59] <%cylish> woops
