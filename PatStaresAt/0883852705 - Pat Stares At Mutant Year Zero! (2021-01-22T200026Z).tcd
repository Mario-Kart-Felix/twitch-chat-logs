[0:43:13] <antshadow14> normal
[0:43:15] <%Pappajimbo> get gud
[0:43:20] <%BoxNavy> do iron duck
[0:43:20] <Dr_Mooose> no iron mutant
[0:43:20] <+PhantomGoo> is this the game with the duck and the pig?
[0:43:21] <LVL1_Scumbag> Don't worry. I'm sure you'll unlock easy mode
[0:43:21] <%NecDW4> Mega Man 1 difficulty selection
[0:43:23] <%X2Eliah> Man why can't they call difficulty modes by their real names?
[0:43:25] <%Agami23> i wish more games said "this was the developers intended
[0:43:29] <%Zetheos> should I finish this game? I played a lot of it like a year ago
[0:43:30] <penitentpendant> Never do a first run of a game on Iron mode
[0:43:37] <Coystick> XDuck Enemy Unquacked
[0:43:40] <%logoth_> Is this the sequel to mutant league?
[0:43:40] <TwoStarPlayersNik> This game is like X-Com = Easy in the beginning, really hard in the middle, manageable again in the end
[0:43:41] <+gustavozxd> easy for people who are embarrassed of playing on the option that says easy
[0:43:42] <yeetdabsenpai69> what are you Pat a COWARD?
[0:43:45] <ergulor> didn't you play this or it was just vinny?
[0:43:48] <yeetdabsenpai69> yes he is yeetdabsenpai69
[0:43:50] <yeetdabsenpai69> ah fair
[0:43:51] <oniwahoo> So is this that Orwell Animal Farm game that they were making?
[0:43:51] <psimon_> game is fun
[0:43:51] <BlkFlameKami> that's a duck
[0:43:56] <%BoxNavy> vinny played this
[0:43:58] <%watts121> ...his name is Ducks?
[0:44:00] <Coystick> Need waterchip
[0:44:01] <+Dova573> is this beyond good and evil?
[0:44:04] <%grimmsean> this just makes me think of the Beyond Good and Evil sequel we're never getting
[0:44:06] <$dalmek> Dux the duck, and I assume Hammon the pig
[0:44:13] <%ConLin_Arts_> is it me or is framerate bad?
[0:44:14] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> this looks like unity
[0:44:15] <+MillerLowlife> who talking animals
[0:44:18] <Mr_Rakjo> FPS is not good
[0:44:19] <%Breaknoon> @grimmsean ^THIS

[0:44:26] <Coystick> I miss Duckman
[0:44:28] <%BoxNavy> the frames are crusty for me too
[0:44:29] <+paladinstarbuster> animal xcom
[0:44:30] <BlkFlameKami> duckman was a good show
[0:44:30] <%blastyoboots> pig man pat? a little on the nose
[0:44:30] <+gustavozxd> I like the portrait at the top
[0:44:31] <%crimsonharvest> its a bit chop
[0:44:33] <+Gigagoat> Looney toons got weird
[0:44:34] <oniwahoo> A pigman? Why did they put me in the game?
[0:44:34] <KilljoyHexx> Duck man, duck man, duck man
[0:44:34] <%linSP> Is this the furry xcom
[0:44:36] <%mikessdd> What is up with dystopian futures and their water pumps? They’re always broken!
[0:44:37] <TwoStarPlayersNik> Hammon is, surprisingly enough, not a pig
[0:44:39] <%NecDW4> Duckman? I didnt know Jason Alexander did vidya gaaems
[0:44:39] <Mr_Rakjo> FRAMERATE IS Chunky @PatStaresAt
[0:44:42] <a_mad_dragon_> DuckerZ
[0:44:44] <%Breaknoon> DAMMIT BERNICE
[0:44:45] <+atin2000> pats finally got an accurate role play
[0:44:46] <Broken_Sonex> Pat and Woolie
[0:44:51] <allfinesunshine> What is a duck but a miserable pile of secrets?
[0:44:52] <%BoxNavy> theres some crust
[0:44:53] <Mattais88> ...and now I'm thinking about human sized duck penises.
[0:44:55] <%Maids4lyfe> no
[0:44:56] <%BoxNavy> yes
[0:44:57] <%g0atmeal> yeah
[0:44:57] <%Visorak6> It is yeah
[0:44:57] <+Midashu> little bit
[0:44:57] <tubit> yes
[0:44:58] <Dr_Mooose> little bit
[0:44:58] <%caramelatte1> very
[0:44:59] <%maenos2> seems fine to me
[0:44:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> Little chunk
[0:45:00] <%g0atmeal> just a bit
[0:45:00] <%crimsonharvest> framerate feels like vsync but too low framerate to supply it
[0:45:00] <+Jiziason> @mikessdd ancient technology lost in the annals of time LUL
[0:45:01] <%BinaryFireball> I hope they put some more work into this game
[0:45:01] <Nitesco> ye
[0:45:02] <Mr_Rakjo> yes
[0:45:03] <KaiserMario> oof yeah
[0:45:04] <%MoguManda> a little
[0:45:05] <%Breaknoon> looks kinda chunky
[0:45:05] <iosephe> feels that way
[0:45:06] <%JamesCorck> lil bit
[0:45:07] <+Count_Graagh> slightly
[0:45:07] <%Maids4lyfe> looks fine
[0:45:08] <spacecatstreams> can't tell if its the game or not
[0:45:08] <+gustavozxd> they look like they've been through WW3 in the portraits
[0:45:10] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> the bitrate might be doing that. Feels choppy
[0:45:10] <%blaccbird914> guess its my end
[0:45:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> The trees causing chunk.
[0:45:18] <%Aluminar> it's fine
[0:45:18] <%Huntercd> Is this the furry game?
[0:45:19] <TheZearGuy> It’s a feature
[0:45:20] <%Plus_On_Black> What happened to the woman in this game?
[0:45:26] <%Breaknoon> maybe it's the motion blur?
[0:45:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> smol
[0:45:31] <%ConLin_Arts_> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[0:45:35] <Broken_Sonex> What would Woolie’s spirit animal be?

[0:45:39] <%Maids4lyfe> why would you do that
[0:45:40] <%chambatron> chonk
[0:45:40] <+Roglef> don't think it's the frame rate necessarily
[0:45:41] <%BinaryFireball> resize the transform bb
[0:45:42] <nilla_24> time to break the game
[0:45:43] <dukenux> turn motion blur off

[0:47:03] <TwoStarPlayersNik> Since combat in this game is turn based, I don't care if the framerate isn't perfect
[0:47:05] <tubit> Looks a bit better i think
[0:47:07] <%josstil> psaHoldon
[0:47:07] <%Breaknoon> that looks a bit better

[0:47:20] <TwoStarPlayersNik> oh yeah this game is HEAVY cpu intensive
[0:47:20] <+Midashu> Chonkin' that CPU
[0:47:22] <%Visorak6> Getting CPU gated?
[0:47:24] <dukenux> Its the Cyberpunk curse
[0:47:25] <+Agentoracle> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:47:25] <%theMrRoboto> does pat never do private streams to set shit up? seems like he only ever uses obs window
[0:47:26] <Broken_Sonex> This is somehow Woolie’s fault
[0:47:27] <+takutoots> CPU soup
[0:47:28] <%BoxNavy> pc truly is the master race
[0:47:30] <Djinnazz> SHADOWS
[0:47:36] <%ConLin_Arts_> Sweden eats CPU
[0:47:37] <+Gigagoat> to power the furrys
[0:47:39] <tubit> CPU Sås
[0:47:41] <%Breaknoon> only runs on a single core
[0:47:42] <Djinnazz> it's always the shdows
[0:47:42] <NitronStreams> CPU be sweatin'
[0:47:45] <%mikessdd> Ooof. Yeah if cpu is getting choked stream gets killed
[0:47:46] <dukenux> just buy better cpu then 4Head
[0:47:47] <BigManAinsley> Pour some more juice in
[0:47:48] <KaiserMario> IT'S MINING FOR BITCOINS
[0:47:50] <TwoStarPlayersNik> Try removing motion blur
[0:47:50] <psimon_> motion blur on DansGame
[0:47:50] <%crimsonharvest> blur off, AI down?

[0:47:58] <+Agentoracle> Turn down foliaghe.
[0:48:01] <nivlac_555> chonky stream time
[0:48:01] <owazowski> It has to render duck and pig penises
[0:48:02] <%Breaknoon> a pool with a bottle neck
[0:48:06] <%Visorak6> Does it have something to do with the encoder?
[0:48:06] <+smuggleruncle> need that scania gpu

[0:48:25] <%BoxNavy> its better
[0:48:26] <TwoStarPlayersNik> Same thing for me, running this game and OBS at the same time made my computer cry
[0:48:29] <Dr_Mooose> well that works
[0:48:30] <+Gigagoat> smoooth
[0:48:31] <%crimsonharvest> is it even appreciably different
[0:48:33] <%mikessdd> If Pat buys a new cpu he probably needs a new mobo. Guessing he doesn’t want to bother with that much.
[0:48:34] <%Visorak6> That doesnt actually seem a whole lot better
[0:48:36] <Elsewize> That is technically better.
[0:48:39] <%JamesCorck> same thing here...
[0:48:40] <%BoxNavy> jermaSun

[0:48:54] <%Breaknoon> Yeah
[0:48:55] <Mr_Rakjo> There is a 3d Shadows at the End of the graphic option @PatStaresAt
[0:48:56] <%mikessdd> Oh hey that’s not bad.
[0:48:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> I bet it has something to do with the foliage. I have a feeling in on my scrote
[0:49:00] <%ConLin_Arts_> it is butter
[0:49:02] <%crimsonharvest> its good but kind of fuzzy lookin now
[0:49:03] <%BoxNavy> why are the trees ghostly now
[0:49:08] <Ozavic> my money is on soft shadows
[0:49:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Is this game good

[0:57:46] <LorcaNomad> is this like Mouseguard?
[0:57:51] <pokefan3000oficial> Scoot
[0:57:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Looney Toons as some pretty dark episodes
[0:57:54] <+takutoots> wai twasn't there a show like that but they were superheros?
[0:57:55] <TwoStarPlayersNik> Hide is important
[0:58:01] <LorcaNomad> in terms of setting that is
[0:58:02] <BlkFlameKami> elmo woe
[0:58:02] <%patriotrenegade> Just get a better computer
[0:58:03] <%Promessa_EX> nice tree renderer
[0:58:04] <%BoxNavy> help elmo
[0:58:06] <%PanicSwytch> psaWink psaWink
[0:58:09] <psimon_> this coming from someone who isn't into turn based games at all, the game is genuinely fun binged it to the end
[0:58:11] <TwoStarPlayersNik> This is X-com, but when you're not in combat it's real time instead of turn based
[0:58:13] <%goose_attack_almanac> It's Bebop and Ducksteady
[0:58:14] <dukenux> wasnt there a comic book "Inspector LeQuack" or sth
[0:58:21] <%crimsonharvest> "Dux" means like the big man on campus in latin, as in 'architeuthus dux'
[0:58:25] <%mikessdd> Pat has a better computer than most people
[0:58:26] <%Treuan> Well now we know
[0:58:44] <%BoxNavy> yes
[0:58:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Just like real life
[0:58:52] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Funny enough, Mutant Year Zero is an amazing Tabletop RPG
[0:58:55] <oniwahoo> It's not great
[0:58:56] <%KaijuUltimax> Draw your own, scrub
[0:58:57] <Profmcstevie> Thematically appropriate to be shitty
[0:59:00] <dukenux> such is life in the zone
[0:59:02] <LunarRemix> That's for fast traveling to other zones
[0:59:03] <iosephe> it's a tourist map
[0:59:04] <+rerun131> Pigs cant read maps anyway
[0:59:06] <@SoFarFetched> thats cool
[0:59:06] <%Treuan> Maybe the mutant year zero road to eden was inside us all along
[0:59:12] <%ConLin_Arts_> just like Cyberpunk
[0:59:13] <penitentpendant> It's more Visual Lore than an actual map
[0:59:17] <psimon_> it is
[0:59:24] <%Promessa_EX> isn't that like every rpg worth playing
[0:59:28] <Pookiedaexzile> 10 minutes
[0:59:30] <LorcaNomad> tabletop games are so fucking imaginative
[0:59:40] <%g0atmeal> just memorize the whole layout 4Head
[0:59:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Menus the LP
[1:00:00] <penitentpendant> That map for RE8 makes me hopeful that The Village itself is a recurring hub
[1:00:17] <Shwepie> If this game doesn't click with Pat, I wouldn't be surprised. It's a bit rough.
[1:00:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> Orcs?
[1:00:30] <%BoxNavy> good meat moon2H
[1:00:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Are we in Warhammer now?
[1:00:38] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:00:40] <TwoStarPlayersNik> @PatStaresAt in this game, stealth is king. set up your boys in hiding and get the drop on enemies
[1:00:43] <dukenux> GET OUT OF HERE STALKER
[1:00:53] <%BoxNavy> aggro rings monkaS
[1:00:55] <oniwahoo> Orkie Bois?
[1:01:01] <%KineticZen> I love the art style actually, looks cartoony
[1:01:01] <Profmcstevie> Competent and budget, the perfect measure
[1:01:04] <LVL1_Scumbag> visible aggro range
[1:01:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> Hey hey people. Maybe Sseth here
[1:01:16] <psimon_> i remeber it having tutorials up the ass. you truend it off maybe?
[1:01:16] <penitentpendant> Ambush round is go?
[1:01:22] <%ConLin_Arts_> monkaS
[1:01:22] <dukenux> liking the John Carpenter music
[1:01:23] <%BinaryFireball> amboosh
[1:01:24] <%Alazull> It looks cartoonish but it's well made
[1:01:27] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:01:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Big scare
[1:01:32] <sonofthedeepsouth> ohohoh
[1:01:34] <Mr_Rakjo> B L I N D
[1:01:42] <oniwahoo> this seems pretty cool so far
[1:01:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> activate the aggro pat
[1:01:45] <%miguelrod777> Ballsy
[1:01:52] <TwoStarPlayersNik> @PatStaresAt teammates who are in hiding and who you AREN'T controlling won't get spotted. This is very important to know.
[1:02:02] <%BoxNavy> wait are they humans?
[1:02:13] <Jolnir> psaDab
[1:02:14] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I gotta get around to playing this sometime. Got it for free awhile back
[1:02:15] <mike2hands> @PatStaresAt if you hide in a tree even if you're in his radius he can't see you
[1:02:16] <Profmcstevie> The real time but also turn based blend is super rad, makes initiating important
[1:02:19] <penitentpendant> Just slap them cheeks with a Sneak Attack
[1:02:20] <%BoxNavy> huh
[1:02:21] <%Monkeyweed21> bitch save
[1:02:24] <+chase959> so humans?
[1:02:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pat killing his own kind in the race war
[1:02:25] <%DashXero> So... Just Humans.
[1:02:26] <+Zebylth> so humans
[1:02:26] <oniwahoo> Pat Save Scummer Boivin?
[1:02:28] <Mattais88> I thought they were lizardmen
[1:02:28] <KilljoyHexx> so... humans?
[1:02:28] <LVL1_Scumbag> Just do your safety dance

[1:02:37] <Jolnir> psaCanada
[1:02:38] <bob900000> really?

[1:02:41] <%Alazull> *shambling
[1:02:46] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[1:02:47] <Treuan> You mean to tell me Man is the real monster?
[1:02:49] <%gear1033> @patstaresat use the ducks bow it's a silent weapon
[1:02:51] <dukenux> no vey
[1:02:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Mutant and proud
[1:02:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Very Xcom indeed
[1:03:01] <%THATGUY_789> I agree im human and also an asshole
[1:03:02] <%TheNegligibleOne> ooohhh nice beat
[1:03:03] <bob900000> dogs should be the superior race
[1:03:03] <Broken_Sonex> Humans are fucking disgusting
[1:03:11] <penitentpendant> Oh good "You have not been spotted" is displayed at the top
[1:03:17] <Dino_from_YoAssThiccPark> SourPls
[1:03:19] <%logoth_> Howard the duck

[1:03:26] <%Daxalog> Hows the turn feel?
[1:03:27] <LVL1_Scumbag> ezpz
[1:03:29] <Winner_92> god damn that dude got wrecked
[1:03:32] <oniwahoo> 100% chance to hit, so it's not xcom
[1:03:33] <Mattais88> LIke a punk
[1:03:37] <%BinaryFireball> yea you shot him
[1:03:42] <%BinaryFireball> he ded
[1:03:42] <Profmcstevie> Make your own engagements PridePog
[1:03:44] <%BoxNavy> i tottally thought they were gonna be a pack of dudes
[1:03:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh so we're doing Shadowrun rules.
[1:03:51] <Pookiedaexzile> X-com with working Steal mechanics
[1:03:53] <penitentpendant> Silenced weapons ftw
[1:03:55] <donkymagooterson> yup silent weapon attacks don't alert other enemies
[1:03:56] <BlkFlameKami> this looks neat
[1:03:56] <BaronVonProlix> is this Duck XCOM?
[1:04:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> Flanks
[1:04:15] <%Huntercd> Furry XCOM
[1:04:15] <penitentpendant> Wait, 50% hit chance?
[1:04:23] <TwoStarPlayersNik> @PatStaresAt you can take out entire maps with sniping, one enemy at a time, and most of the time, you SHOULD. Open firefights is a bad idea, you're always massively outnumbered
[1:04:23] <%Alazull> TAKE THE SHOT
[1:04:23] <%CatastropheCorvid> DuXCOM
[1:04:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's funny, I was just playing XCOM 2 before joining in on this stream too
[1:04:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Just go for the shot
[1:04:56] <%Alazull> This seems competently made dude
[1:05:04] <%miguelrod777> lol
[1:05:05] <penitentpendant> DeD, Lootable
[1:05:08] <Dr_Mooose> perfect
[1:05:13] <%rekinom> xcom but animals?
[1:05:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pat betrays his own
[1:05:17] <DaBigVitus> its a very competent gam
[1:05:19] <%BoxNavy> i dont play these kinds of games myself but i love watching pat play them
[1:05:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> Bitch
[1:05:22] <%Alazull> That one combat encounter seems better than a lot of Xcom
[1:05:22] <+MillerLowlife> hate those fuckin things
[1:05:24] <Mattais88> loot their corpses?
[1:05:25] <dukenux> Overwatch - aka Blizzard's CBT dungeon
[1:05:33] <%Huntercd> Pat the traitor
[1:05:34] <%THATGUY_789> THATGUY_789 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 44 months! hey O Pat man. just wanted to say G'day from Down Under. keep on keeping on
[1:05:34] <Jolnir> psaSmug
[1:05:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Humans are lame, Mutant reigns supreme
[1:05:38] <%KineticZen> Flaming arrows
[1:05:39] <Pookiedaexzile> ManBeast must be purged
[1:05:45] <Pookiedaexzile> The Beastmen will rise
[1:05:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Hu-mies
[1:05:58] <+Kingdom_65> Ugh god, that camera motion blur is fucking terrible
[1:05:59] <%Alazull> Down with Humanity, the true evil
[1:06:00] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Yeah I'm surprised the video game map is so bad when the tabletop rpg one is like, super important since the game is based on the party moving through a hex-grid map and encountering shit.
[1:06:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> Mental Note take out Pat when the mutant uprising starts
[1:06:05] <dukenux> Kill the Manfools
[1:06:09] <+TheBitingIrish> furries DansGame
[1:06:17] <%GarbageNirvana> XCOM was a good proof of concept and then everyone did it better
[1:06:18] <oniwahoo> Reject Humanity Return to Monke
[1:06:21] <%Promessa_EX> the normie streamers and esports nerds are gonna play overwatch 2 no matter what
[1:06:22] <+Surf_Zombie> Howard the duck commando?
[1:06:23] <%ConLin_Arts_> Alan Wake was Finnish
[1:06:23] <%Visorak6> yes
[1:06:23] <+Delenay> i see it
[1:06:24] <%Alazull> I can see that
[1:06:26] <%ZephynM> Makes sense to me
[1:06:27] <%DashXero> Yeah. Makes sense.
[1:06:29] <%BoxNavy> i can kinda see the alan wake
[1:06:31] <%DakotaMacDoodle> feels right
[1:06:31] <IMCthulhu> feels more like alan wake+xcom
[1:06:31] <%KineticZen> Alan Wake with the lighting and flashlight
[1:06:32] <dukenux> a bit
[1:06:35] <%KineticZen> WC3 with the playermodels
[1:06:38] <Tooniearcade> Ye
[1:06:38] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I can see it
[1:06:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> The Duck cannot swim
[1:06:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> Zoom into the protagonist facd: Mankind was the evil all along
[1:06:41] <penitentpendant> It's a pull, but there's logic at least
[1:06:43] <dukenux> yeye, a proper wciii remaster
[1:06:44] <DaBigVitus> it's a late 80's/early 90's pen and paper rpg. they have strong aesthetics
[1:06:45] <%crimsonharvest> Its got the dense foliage, the bold green, and the omnipresent fog
[1:06:46] <Dreigun> I was kinda thinking Dungeon Siege
[1:06:47] <%THATGUY_789> but yr a duck?
[1:06:53] <ZComiX> I feel that
[1:06:54] <donkymagooterson> makes sense - this is a weird but solid game across the board imo
[1:06:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> Smol
[1:06:59] <%BoxNavy> F A T dick
[1:07:01] <%ConLin_Arts_> Girthy
[1:07:02] <%Puhff> When do you NOT talk out of butt???
[1:07:06] <BlkFlameKami> a chode area
[1:07:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> Wide dick status
[1:07:07] <arikk42> Pat have you played JAGGED ALLIANCE 2 (1999)
[1:07:08] <TwoStarPlayersNik> @PatStaresAt this game encourages you to scout every new map you get to and pick off stragglers with stealth before engaging with the enemy forrealsies
[1:07:08] <+Piemen99> WIDE path
[1:07:09] <%Alazull> Girthy pathing
[1:07:10] <Pookiedaexzile> A chode map
[1:07:11] <oniwahoo> a wide corridor
[1:07:11] <penitentpendant> The Chunkiest Pork Sausage
[1:07:12] <T_Sasquatch> That's a metaphor i guess

[1:10:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> Zangief fights
[1:10:44] <%barrakuta371> Zangief Uh
[1:10:50] <%Monkeyweed21> would you fuck that pig?
[1:10:51] <%Daxalog> I wish Wasteland would settle on which button click it wants you to use on stuff.
[1:10:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> But Pat look at that gold shiny loot, surely you can run in there and grab it before they kill you. LUL
[1:11:00] <LunarRemix> Yeah I feel like isometric RPGs are kind of a thing the past
[1:11:04] <%Mendin> "Skull WILL kill you? Bet"
[1:11:04] <penitentpendant> Level 2 unlocked
[1:11:06] <%Daxalog> :clapping:
[1:11:06] <%JamesCorck> Pat, would you recommend it at this point?
[1:11:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Chode Map is defeated
[1:11:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> HE DID IT
[1:11:07] <%Piemen99> welp stream done!
[1:11:15] <goose_coward> big porker
[1:11:19] <%Mendin> Like I said earlier, this game is a weird XCom2-RPG mixture
[1:11:21] <%PanicSwytch> Are ya winning son?
[1:11:22] <dukenux> thanks for the stream, Pat
[1:11:23] <+Breaknoon> Pat, did you play Ruiner?
[1:11:24] <+OhioNitsud> world record speedrun
[1:11:24] <%RadDude6969> DuckerZ
[1:11:27] <%crimsonharvest> can you mod them now?
[1:11:35] <%Mendin> Silent Weapons are FOREVERIALLY IMPORTANT
[1:11:41] <%Piemen99> psaDab psaDab psaDab
[1:11:45] <BaronVonProlix> "zone" "Stalkers"...sounds familiar...
[1:11:45] <%Daxalog> But is it Short AND SWEET?
[1:11:45] <LunarRemix> It's short but not that short
[1:11:48] <+IShadowStrykerI> What ever happened to Biomutant?
[1:11:54] <2DSuperiority> FEET
[1:11:55] <TwoStarPlayersNik> @PatStaresAt Crossbow only has one shot and you need to spend an action to reload it, so you may have to pull a pistol if you fail to stealth kill
[1:11:58] <BlkFlameKami> GROG WITH THE BOIS
[1:12:00] <%CzeekyPlays> That's not too bad
[1:12:13] <dukenux> grub with boys B)
[1:12:19] <jowi_time> probably a proof of concept
[1:12:19] <%Zetheos> huh, I have 10 hours in it and didn't feel like I was at the end
[1:12:23] <Profmcstevie> If they didn't have content for 30, 12 it is
[1:12:26] <@SoFarFetched> I thought he almost said Wide Pat
[1:12:29] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt I feel they made it that way to go "You want more? Play the tabletop rpg!!"
[1:12:31] <%DashXero> Best to be left wanting more than wanting less...?
[1:12:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> Short and good>>>>>>>>>Long and ok
[1:12:38] <%ConLin_Arts_> FeelsBadMan
[1:12:43] <%ChungusQuest> Makes you wonder how moddable this game is? Looks like an amazing base for fan content
[1:12:47] <TwoStarPlayersNik> @PatStaresAt With the DLC I'd say it's closer to 25
[1:12:59] <%Mendin> Healing is a premium
[1:13:05] <%Arancet> short can be good for fast paced games, not so good for slow methodical ones like this
[1:13:07] <%Piemen99> time to never use them now
[1:13:14] <dukenux> i realize what else this reminds me of... Darkwood
[1:13:16] <Pookiedaexzile> What?
[1:13:16] <%josstil> psaSkelmo
[1:13:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> WEINWEBARF
[1:13:23] <%Monkeyweed21> Should I get Astral Chain or Bayo 2?
[1:13:24] <dauver> loot blindnes
[1:13:30] <JoshManVGH> This game is giving me SepterraCore vibes.
[1:13:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> He licks it
[1:13:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Food
[1:13:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Prepare for Pat to reload every time he takes damage
[1:13:32] <%ConLin_Arts_> Consume
[1:13:33] <penitentpendant> Save Scumming at MAXIMUM VIABILITY
[1:13:33] <%Visorak6> essence of mcdonalds
[1:13:34] <%Mendin> Astral Chain no question
[1:13:37] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[1:13:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:13:43] <%THATGUY_789> taste of paige
[1:13:44] <%ConLin_Arts_> You don't know Paige????
[1:13:45] <Coystick> "No-uh"
[1:13:46] <%KineticZen> ...what was the question mark there
[1:13:49] <+tigerfang86> Astral Chain for sure
[1:13:56] <%Razputin217> Yes
[1:13:57] <BlacSoul> i feel like that should be a clear yes or no
[1:13:59] <%Razputin217> No
[1:14:02] <%josstil> My dog licks his bed
[1:14:02] <penitentpendant> 100% Astral Chain
[1:14:03] <%Razputin217> Maybe
[1:14:07] <%Arancet> paige is sweating sugar again
[1:14:09] <%Razputin217> I don’t know
[1:14:10] <dizimous> Astral chain is really unique
[1:14:12] <%Mendin> So long, and girthy
[1:14:13] <+Kingdom_65> Yes
[1:14:14] <%kewlmyc> Yes, Yuzu
[1:14:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> Lul
[1:14:15] <%JamesCorck> <3 <3 <3
[1:14:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yeah, a Switch Pro
[1:14:17] <+gustavozxd> probably not astral chain
[1:14:19] <T_Sasquatch> Yes
[1:14:21] <%Razputin217> Can you repeat the question?
[1:14:22] <%Alazull> FIGHTING FOR OUR LIVES
[1:14:22] <+gustavozxd> you can play smash bros
[1:14:23] <%QueequegTheater> But then you'd have to play Astral Chan
[1:14:25] <%arcielardor> I hate the way they use the sword cutting thing.
[1:14:26] <dukenux> long and thick game
[1:14:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> Switch emulators with pat
[1:14:29] <%Promessa_EX> depends how crazy you wanna get
[1:14:31] <TwoStarPlayersNik> First encounter that requires some planning!
[1:14:31] <%Monkeyweed21> cool astral chain it is
[1:14:34] <2DSuperiority> put the game cart in your PS5
[1:14:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Yeah the Switch Pro totally runs the same as a pc
[1:14:39] <ekkieekk> the switch emulator only works with a handful of games i think
[1:14:49] <%linSP> I have a switch emulator on the switch
[1:15:00] <ergulor> Yup
[1:15:03] <+Kingdom_65> Apparently Astral Chain hasn't been tested with Yuzu so, emulation of it isn't possible
[1:15:05] <%Zetheos> very much so yes
[1:15:08] <TwoStarPlayersNik> always pick off stragglers, always
[1:15:13] <+backfire_shot> hey @PatStaresAt does Castle super beast have a discord?
[1:15:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> NICE MUTTIE MEAT

[1:15:47] <%KaijuUltimax> This isn't another "The humans are the REAL monsters" thing is it?
[1:15:49] <%JamesCorck> bless ya.
[1:15:51] <%PanicSwytch> Panzer Dragoon is $6 on Eshop. Should I get it there or ps4?
[1:15:58] <TwoStarPlayersNik> sometimes enemies start going on patrol after they're done with their conversations
[1:16:01] <%QueequegTheater> Bro just summon Master Chief to fight for you
[1:16:02] <%linSP> the humans sound like scaven
[1:16:02] <%Alazull> Coolest, manliest sneezes from big man
[1:16:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> @kaijuultimax It seems it is
[1:16:10] <%Mendin> @KaijuUltimax No, there's good humans too
[1:16:16] <Mattais88> Wh would want to eat a mutant?
[1:16:23] <Chaos_kun> How are you liking this so far Pat?
[1:16:25] <+Kingdom_65> @PanicSwytch Probably PS4?
[1:16:26] <%THATGUY_789> practically oozing testosterone
[1:16:37] <dodgy_dingo_> hello pawdrrig bwavegne von montreey'alll
[1:16:38] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Is this literally just furry Xcom
[1:16:50] <TwoStarPlayersNik> @PatStaresAt you can exit combat if you aren't happy about your set-up, but if you exit combat while being inside their vision range, you will be spotted
[1:16:52] <dukenux> MothDuckMan
[1:16:53] <%grimmsean> why wouldn't the duck just get duck wings...
[1:16:59] <%Agami23> xcom is a rpg???
[1:17:03] <oniwahoo> You had me at furry
[1:17:04] <%ChungusQuest> FURRY FALLOUT
[1:17:05] <blackbaron98> Xcom aint an rpg?
[1:17:06] <%saltduhwound> Furry xcom is exactly what I didn’t know I needed
[1:17:06] <%JamesCorck> Chimera Squad is Furry X-Com,
[1:17:09] <%Alazull> Well yes, but also no
[1:17:11] <shaddydaddyo> this game is dope
[1:17:14] <%X2Eliah> Furry Chernobyl Xcom from sweden
[1:17:22] <Chaos_kun> I thought that was a duck hat. Nope. It’s a duckmen
[1:17:22] <Broken_Sonex> FURRY FALLOUT
[1:17:23] <%QueequegTheater> Why wouldn't you go for HP
[1:17:28] <goose_coward> beef that duck
[1:17:28] <%Promessa_EX> do weird stuff
[1:17:28] <TwoStarPlayersNik> knee shot is garbo
[1:17:32] <dukenux> this is Furry Stalker
[1:17:33] <%KaijuUltimax> @grimmsean Because it's a mutant, not a furry
[1:17:41] <dukenux> but with xcom gameplay
[1:17:43] <Dr_Mooose> but that damage tho
[1:17:44] <TwoStarPlayersNik> skull splitter is boss
[1:17:44] <%Daxalog> 100 to 75 for more dmg. Sounds great.
[1:17:52] <%crimsonharvest> maybe you can get a +25% accuracy mod
[1:17:54] <LunarRemix> Skull is good for flanking
[1:17:58] <%Mendin> 100% crit chance might make the difference between a stealth kill anad nothing, but, again, start of the game
[1:18:02] <oniwahoo> I imagine you can do things to overcome that accuracy detriment later
[1:18:03] <%KineticZen> Badass
[1:18:04] <%Visorak6> @PatStaresAt critting on the bow only does +1 damage
[1:18:04] <+LazyAss24Seven> RAAAGE
[1:18:04] <%ConLin_Arts_> WutFace WutFace WutFace
[1:18:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> yup

[1:18:21] <%Mrbaconator> JOKAAAAIIRR
[1:18:23] <%MisterRockett> Just got here what type of game is this again?
[1:18:23] <Chaos_kun> Does it have XCOM shooting odds too?
[1:18:23] <%Mendin> Oh look a Sniper and an Assault
[1:18:25] <+ConLin_Arts_> Biomutant is another Swedish game currently being developed
[1:18:26] <TwoStarPlayersNik> @PatStaresAt high ground is +25% accuracy, so it cancels out and you can still get 100%
[1:18:27] <oniwahoo> MY BRAND
[1:18:28] <psimon_> He might be the tank Kappa
[1:18:31] <penitentpendant> Pork set to BEEFY

[1:19:20] <penitentpendant> PatGapesAt
[1:19:24] <Broken_Sonex> GET THAT GAPER
[1:19:25] <dukenux> my mouth is aGape
[1:19:36] <bakkatohri> Is there a Goat-see gun?

[1:19:38] <%Tenchi_G> I cant tell the joke. I'd be exposed LUL

[1:19:50] <%ChrisPlaysThing> What the duck and dog is this
[1:19:55] <oniwahoo> Kinda seems like Dux is the workhorse of the team
[1:19:57] <%Promessa_EX> nyannBlush nyannScary
[1:20:04] <TwoStarPlayersNik> oh look, an enemy with 6 health, just as you find a weapon with 6 damage
[1:20:08] <penitentpendant> It's nice you can setup your party so freely before engaging
[1:20:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> save scummin
[1:20:25] <+b_aleph> bitch ass save
[1:20:25] <%QueequegTheater> @oniwahoo In fairness, tanks are usually not useful at low levels
[1:20:34] <%CatastropheCorvid> I'll never understand people that come into a stream and ask "Is this game good?" Like, you're looking at it, just watch.
[1:20:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> egoraptor weinerbarf
[1:20:49] <Dr_Mooose> the stealth aspects were done really well
[1:20:51] <TwoStarPlayersNik> you can walk closer and still get 75%, but not be in cover
[1:20:51] <%Visorak6> Its only +1 damage on the bow though
[1:20:59] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Even if it was fake, being able to physically move characters would heavily improve XCOM's feel
[1:20:59] <%MisterRockett> Why you kill da hoomans?
[1:21:07] <%Monkeyweed21> Xcom is about going into the unknown and getting spooked
[1:21:08] <Broken_Sonex> @oniwahoo He’s the Matt Hardy of the duo
[1:21:10] <%Top_Lane_Duelist> lol his name is Dux
[1:21:11] <dukenux> humans bad
[1:21:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> '
[1:21:14] <TwoStarPlayersNik> @PatStaresAt walk up to him before shooting
[1:21:16] <+paladinstarbuster> gape him
[1:21:20] <%Daxalog> It cost 2 actions to fire?
[1:21:24] <jack_s1n> i had no idea this was an xcom
[1:21:25] <penitentpendant> Enemies set to Lootable
[1:21:26] <%Promessa_EX> it's a potato gun
[1:21:26] <Torgue_1> Yep
[1:21:28] <%baka_sugoi> NOICE
[1:21:30] <%CreggaMonsta> This game is actually a stealth puzzle game
[1:21:30] <TwoStarPlayersNik> you can move and shoot, so go for the 100%
[1:21:39] <ManfredA> @QueequegTheater that's why I prefer Valkyria Chronicle's system of actually making you aim yourself
[1:21:40] <+b_aleph> the games rules
[1:21:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, I've only ever heard good things about it
[1:21:45] <+b_aleph> thanks
[1:21:50] <%JamesCorck> Glad you're having a god time <3
[1:21:55] <%JamesCorck> good*
[1:22:01] <dukenux> @creggamonsta so its like Commandos or Invisible inc.
[1:22:08] <Chaos_kun> Is there a character creator?
[1:22:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> there we go. funally-got-the-beepy-motherfu'ker to-beep-off.
[1:22:10] <penitentpendant> It does feel like they have 'an intended path' for characters
[1:22:12] <TwoStarPlayersNik> No pat, moth wings are amazing
[1:22:12] <LunarRemix> The idea is that you're not supposed to get hit most of the time
[1:22:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> I assume you get more points the higher you level.
[1:22:17] <anAngryHamster> you get levels like every fight
[1:22:19] <%Promessa_EX> yeah saving is for nerds
[1:22:22] <shaddydaddyo> no @Chaos_kun
[1:22:29] <Chaos_kun> Or are party characters plotmen
[1:22:40] <shaddydaddyo> plotmen
[1:22:42] <%QueequegTheater> @CreggaMonsta All games are stealth puzzles if you're brave enough
[1:22:43] <%CreggaMonsta> @dukenux yeah kinda. it less xcom more stealth
[1:22:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> this is pretty dope-overall

[1:28:33] <+smuggleruncle> who named it THE ZONE
[1:28:37] <%Piemen99> understandable
[1:28:38] <goose_coward> cyka
[1:28:43] <%Ipsenscastle> Mutant Year Zero was a tabletop game before STALKER i believe
[1:28:45] <%crimsonharvest> reminds me of Caves of Qud
[1:28:46] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt "First they came for the YouTubers, and Pat said nothing"
[1:28:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> Mankind become mutant
[1:28:51] <+backfire_shot> they literally named it the zone
[1:28:52] <jowi_time> LUL
[1:28:54] <%DashXero> So... Maybe the Stalkers should just leave....
[1:28:54] <alegut88> So, the experience you're gaining to "level up" is literally just more exposure to nuclear radiation causing you to mutate further?
[1:28:55] <%baka_sugoi> so mutants are old people?

[1:29:08] <%BoxNavy> dude what is up with that dog
[1:29:08] <%KaijuUltimax> @primarch_lupercal The term Stalker predates the game and is a real term used to describe people who explored the Chernobyl disaster area
[1:29:10] <%Agami23> wait, is this a picnic themed game??
[1:29:12] <ape_hawk> just apply a bandaid to the fire
[1:29:12] <Mattais88> So are they people who becasme furry, or animals who got sentience?
[1:29:13] <+storebrandcandy> if you are on fire try to stop being on fire

[1:29:40] <%W1nterTitan> I don't want to buy another game but ffffuuuuuuuck this looks good.
[1:29:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> For new games

[1:33:47] <%baka_sugoi> woolieLORE
[1:33:56] <donkymagooterson> clap kppFAIL
[1:34:02] <dukenux> woolieLORE
[1:34:09] <%baka_sugoi> quack
[1:34:10] <heartlesshealer> if language persists, so will puns
[1:34:16] <dukenux> damn ghoul bastards gotta pay B)
[1:34:29] <+Ancisace> The "You have not been spotted" thing is cool
[1:34:30] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:34:38] <penitentpendant> Oho! An exit combat button, nice!
[1:34:41] <%AzureGale> This changes everything!
[1:34:51] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt This really feels like someone played XCOM 2 and went "the best part of the game is stealth ambushing, let's just make a whole game out of it and also corkscrew penises"
[1:34:58] <penitentpendant> "The enemy heard your one-liner."
[1:35:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> Yeah he keepabtalkin
[1:35:03] <%AzureGale> Hear THIS
[1:35:13] <%crimsonharvest> it only one guy just walk up to him
[1:35:24] <NeoseekerStitch> He defitinely heard his 80's action hero lines
[1:35:27] <Mattais88> Was that a Ric Flair reference?
[1:35:45] <%AzureGale> Doesn't matter if you're caught when your enemies are dead
[1:35:46] <heartlesshealer> I like that it tells you when you're caught sneaking
[1:35:52] <oniwahoo> wooooooooooo
[1:35:59] <+Kingdom_65> Paige has Ancient Sight.
[1:35:59] <%baka_sugoi> woolieSHOOK
[1:35:59] <%ghostofsolomon> that Sight has seen thing syou know
[1:36:00] <heartlesshealer> put a scope on that scatter gun?
[1:36:05] <penitentpendant> I like the text choice for 'level up' good retro feel
[1:36:06] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt All hail our glorious protector ACOG
[1:36:07] <%Piemen99> dope ass name
[1:36:12] <+storebrandcandy> give me sight beyond sight
[1:36:25] <+Ancisace> Surprisingly pretty game. I figured this would be more...indie looking
[1:36:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeyeye
[1:36:34] <penitentpendant> Rushdown
[1:36:36] <TwoStarPlayersNik> @PatStaresAt Run N Gun is bonkers good
[1:36:37] <%AzureGale> That's like the XCOM ability
[1:36:41] <%CzeekyPlays> It even has the same name I think lol "Run n Gun"
[1:36:47] <anAngryHamster> Same name and everything
[1:36:47] <%QueequegTheater> And you get it at like Corporal
[1:36:50] <aluddss> they took the good stuff thank god
[1:37:01] <+gustavozxd> not hiding it
[1:37:01] <%KaijuUltimax> It's the single best ability in all of Xcom, I will fight anyone on this
[1:37:02] <+b_aleph> pat
[1:37:06] <%Aeoneth> Ehhh, Lightning Reflexes and Blademaster are better imo
[1:37:13] <heartlesshealer> pat, Ancient Sight any use for your guys or will it override anything?
[1:37:14] <%Promessa_EX> do drugs
[1:37:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pat to the pharmacy
[1:37:20] <%baka_sugoi> MAI PILLZ

[1:37:29] <%X2Eliah> Buy them from a friend
[1:37:30] <reonome> MY HEAD
[1:37:30] <%cowardman93> I didn't expect this game to have... movement. I thought it was a 1:1 Xcom thing
[1:37:32] <%Mendin> gunmods have to be done at base, I think it said
[1:37:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> Snort em inject em eat em
[1:37:35] <ManfredA> lightning reflexes loses because I have Thin Man PTSD
[1:37:35] <%crimsonharvest> been getting the bulk of mine by mail
[1:37:37] <%AzureGale> PEELZ HERE
[1:37:44] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt They're also really lucky that U.S. courts have more or less codified that specific game mechanics CANNOT be copyrighted
[1:37:49] <heartlesshealer> Ah, thanks @Mendin
[1:37:50] <%Promessa_EX> get yourself some badass prescriptions
[1:37:52] <%BoxNavy> :)

[1:38:11] <%Daxalog> And thus Patt decided to adopt a Teacup piggy

[1:41:09] <%cowardman93> @AzureGale cat purring is more calming to me
[1:41:13] <penitentpendant> The graveliest of narration
[1:41:14] <%ghostofsolomon> @dukenux none for me so far
[1:41:14] <%QueequegTheater> @AzureGale Definitely cats, it's tough to discern happy pant from distress pant for me

[1:46:25] <%endyfilter> endyfilter subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! I recommend you look into the game Omori. It might interest you and Paige.

[1:49:21] <heartlesshealer> up that range <3
[1:49:35] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> I didn’t know anything about this game going in and it sold me just on the aesthetic alone
[1:49:43] <%Promessa_EX> put scope
[1:49:43] <+Kingdom_65> Does Dux fux?
[1:49:45] <BlkFlameKami> THANK YOU HAT
[1:49:46] <+lethallylactic> That's a good hat!
[1:49:46] <+a_c_chirns> why is that duck holding a gun
[1:49:46] <heartlesshealer> BUT WHAT IF
[1:49:47] <$RealThiele> Quackshot
[1:49:47] <%Daxalog> Scope it to 20?
[1:49:50] <%baka_sugoi> S T A T S
[1:49:53] <TwoStarPlayersNik> @PatStaresAt Note that Pipegun is not silent, very important
[1:49:54] <Torgue_1> Don't forget to attach scopes
[1:49:56] <goose_coward> f a r
[1:49:57] <%Mendin> Slap some mods on your boys' stuff, you got a scope and a fire thingy, I think
[1:49:59] <+storebrandcandy> put another smaller hat on the gun
[1:50:00] <skyentombment> Hey Pat, I know you don't care at all about cars, but have you ever watched a channel caller Regular Car Reviews?
[1:50:04] <heartlesshealer> MOD
[1:50:04] <+mgskomododragon> and with the scope?
[1:50:11] <%THATGUY_789> Stats stares at
[1:50:12] <heartlesshealer> oh please oh please oh please
[1:50:18] <%crimsonharvest> did you attach the burning attachment?
[1:50:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeyeye
[1:50:19] <%Promessa_EX> do big number
[1:50:20] <heartlesshealer> at least hover the number
[1:50:21] <%Visorak6> Probably the gaper?
[1:50:22] <%baka_sugoi> crossbow
[1:50:22] <TwoStarPlayersNik> Scope on bow, get 100% accuracy from longer range
[1:50:22] <+OhioNitsud> scope the gape
[1:50:25] <heartlesshealer> just hover
[1:50:31] <%megaman_sentinel> the psaGoblin can't win today
[1:50:32] <MonstarGrrrl> attach it to your BUTT
[1:50:36] <dukenux> gape from afar
[1:50:46] <%crimsonharvest> put the broiler on the gaper?
[1:50:48] <heartlesshealer> bow is fair since it's silent
[1:50:49] <%Ranryu692> didn't archeologists just discover a perfectly preserved gaper?
[1:50:52] <penitentpendant> When in doubt, fish for that 100%
[1:50:55] <%Zetheos> love that crossbow
[1:51:07] <%Mendin> Juice your silent weapon yeah
[1:51:08] <%CreggaMonsta> yes it is
[1:51:09] <donkymagooterson> that silent trait is gonna get more important as you get further in imo
[1:51:09] <%baka_sugoi> up gape
[1:51:11] <%Visorak6> The bow upgrade just makes it on par with the rifle though
[1:51:17] <heartlesshealer> strong silent weapons is really good always
[1:51:19] <%Daxalog> What if you find a new crossbow the second you leave?
[1:51:20] <%THATGUY_789> Long distance gape
[1:51:30] <%CreggaMonsta> stealth weapons are the way to go
[1:51:31] <TwoStarPlayersNik> bow is a safe investment
[1:51:31] <$RealThiele> number needs embiggening
[1:51:35] <SnapIntoaTimJim> Action Economy Pat. You need to reload.
[1:51:36] <heartlesshealer> oh man that's true
[1:51:39] <BlkFlameKami> is zangief sleepan?
[1:51:42] <goatlord_> Is this better than Xcom
[1:51:42] <%Zetheos> I don't think a new silent weapon shows up for awhile, and it can always go to piggy
[1:51:46] <%megaman_sentinel> an u might want 2 go silence
[1:51:53] <heartlesshealer> at least attaching mods like sights doesn't cost anything
[1:51:55] <%Mendin> pat you have a fire damage mod too
[1:52:00] <penitentpendant> You probably want a silent and unsilent option as time goes on. But usually a good silent option early pays dividends.
[1:52:05] <%Mendin> Give it to pigman
[1:52:09] <+TheBitingIrish> pap cum
[1:52:13] <%Ellila> You will want a silent gun that does a lot of damage in the future
[1:52:15] <NiktenKing> Not silent
[1:52:19] <%THATGUY_789> Hypegun
[1:52:20] <heartlesshealer> yeah, more shots between reloading
[1:52:26] <%JamesCorck> @PatStaresAt is this on GoG and/or Steam or is this like exclusive to other services (ie epic, etc.)?
[1:52:52] <TwoStarPlayersNik> Invest in Gaper, sell scattergun
[1:52:59] <%crimsonharvest> its been free on epic i think?
[1:53:00] <%Piemono> It was free on Epic a while back
[1:53:01] <heartlesshealer> it's on the PC stores, yeah
[1:53:04] <%Visorak6> Low crit
[1:53:08] <%Zetheos> Ammo, that's it
[1:53:08] <+TheBitingIrish> ???
[1:53:10] <penitentpendant> Less shots before reload
[1:53:11] <%Daxalog> I think the gaper took 2 actions per use?
[1:53:11] <%crimsonharvest> scattergun crits more and reloads less often
[1:53:13] <heartlesshealer> scattergun is more crit focused
[1:53:13] <TwoStarPlayersNik> scattergun is dogshit
[1:53:14] <Torgue_1> @JamesCorck It's on all PC stores
[1:53:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Worse crit
[1:53:16] <%Ipsenscastle> the name
[1:53:17] <%Zetheos> eh, crit yeah
[1:53:19] <%JamesCorck> I might pick it up, I'm getting sold on this.
[1:53:21] <goose_coward> put er' all on gaper
[1:53:23] <$RealThiele> shotguns rip
[1:53:26] <SnapIntoaTimJim> Crit, ammo. Action Economy.
[1:53:27] <%JamesCorck> Thank you guys n.n
[1:53:32] <%Zetheos> I got this one in a humble bundle at one point
[1:53:38] <%Zetheos> well worth
[1:53:38] <%Promessa_EX> i'm a crit fan
[1:53:40] <%Daxalog> Half chance to burn enemies
[1:53:42] <%crimsonharvest> chance to catch on fire sounds really good when it hits
[1:53:47] <heartlesshealer> that burning? =)
[1:53:48] <%Mendin> The mods are removable freely, less brainworms needed
[1:53:52] <%pectusumbra> pectusumbra subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Hoi Pat. 9 months, something something something THE BABY
[1:54:02] <TwoStarPlayersNik> @PatStaresAt you can take out weapon mods at will, it's not a permanent slot-in
[1:54:25] <%Mendin> ayyy
[1:54:52] <lyriuswolf> I don't reccomend buying weapons so early
[1:55:01] <+TheMorilo> Is this game good?
[1:55:04] <heartlesshealer> Did Dux get more skill points from leveling, or just your tank man?
[1:55:10] <%Mendin> And this is like 20-30min into the game
[1:55:10] <TwoStarPlayersNik> No I wouldn't have bought the pipegun
[1:55:14] <%Mendin> They both did
[1:55:20] <+allups> thats how it be
[1:55:27] <heartlesshealer> nice
[1:55:27] <lyriuswolf> It's a scavenge game, it means you're bound to find it
[1:55:33] <+Ancisace> Eh, beginning of the game. Cna't expect perfect optimisation.
[1:55:43] <%Visorak6> Also consider this is an LP, absolute optimum play isnt always the call
[1:55:56] <%THATGUY_789> contact crazy talk
[1:56:03] <dragonofdojima6> Get out of here stalker
[1:56:04] <%blastyoboots> I love the crowds of rats scurrying out from under rusted cars

[2:04:20] <LasDrakeo> what does overwatch mean?
[2:04:52] <+Ancisace> In XCom it means that the character shoots the first enemy that moves that in their vision cone.
[2:04:55] <+Midknightsun316> @LasDrakeo Enemy moves into your guys LOS your dude gets a shot at him
[2:04:59] <lyriuswolf> ALL IN ON SHAMAN

[2:09:24] <TrollKing96> Is ammo a concern or do you only need to worry about it in combat?

[2:09:52] <%ForlornCarton> Item behind cabin
[2:09:56] <+OhioNitsud> item spoilers
[2:09:59] <Torgue_1> @TrollKing96 Only in combat

[2:10:22] <heartlesshealer> I meant the item at the log dux was near during battle
[2:10:42] <%megaman_sentinel> humans?
[2:10:43] <%Mendin> @Dead_Trickster post-apocalypse, some ghouls, some humans, some big-mutants
[2:10:43] <+Ancisace> @Dead_Trickster Post-apocalypse, one last home for humanity, "stalkers" like our mutant friends keep it fed/fuelled by going into the wasteland

[2:11:36] <%SirGO0SE> a lot of games with slides as cut scenes take too long to get through it but that was paced well

[2:12:04] <SophisticHades> and hes a hog
[2:12:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> How did you not get it before now
[2:12:07] <+TheBitingIrish> Yes, but is Hammon a pig-man?
[2:12:07] <Teyaric> He's also a hardcore Lawful Neutral Cop type
[2:12:08] <%CzarinaXANA> Re-dux
[2:12:10] <studleydoorite> I assumed Dux and Bormin were your dumb custom names, till the cutscene
[2:12:12] <%Mendin> This game is solid, yes
[2:12:15] <+Kingdom_65> Patrick Bormin
[2:12:15] <%ghostofsolomon> YOU MEAN A TELESCOPE?
[2:12:18] <+Ancisace> I'm only paying slight attention
[2:12:20] <%Mendin> Frank Dux
[2:12:21] <%Ipsenscastle> Bormin, more like BOIVIN
[2:12:25] <%Promessa_EX> ham mon
[2:12:25] <%Zetheos> heh
[2:12:25] <illtima> THey're both himbos
[2:12:29] <%MisterRockett> He looked out the wrong end.
[2:12:29] <%blastyoboots> looked into the scope backwards
[2:12:30] <$dalmek> I think Dux looked in the wrong end
[2:12:40] <studleydoorite> ... isn't every pizza melted?
[2:12:42] <%Arancet> squishy dog puddle
[2:12:52] <TwoStarPlayersNik> don't forget to kill the zone dogs for juicy exp
[2:12:56] <heartlesshealer> dux is more like a scruff than a himbo if we're going by attitude
[2:12:58] <%crimsonharvest> wow look at these world of warcraft ass brambles
[2:13:02] <%ForlornCarton> Was there another item behind the cabin, or am I crazy?
[2:13:16] <Torgue_1> Maybe both?
[2:13:18] <bleugh> zone dawwg
[2:13:18] <%KaijuUltimax> @studleydoorite Only the cheese, you don't melt the dough or the sauce
[2:13:20] <%ForlornCarton> got it
[2:13:24] <%SirGO0SE> Kenny's boat poggers
[2:13:29] <@commanderclaw> This game is rather chill for a post apoc setting
[2:13:32] <heartlesshealer> circle of threat
[2:13:34] <%BoxNavy> no
[2:13:41] <TwoStarPlayersNik> they will rush you
[2:13:46] <%MrPedrovsky> @patstaresat Missed the notification. Are you liking the game so far?
[2:13:46] <goose_coward> bork bustin' time
[2:13:49] <%crimsonharvest> i love it when the apocalypse is so far in the past
[2:13:56] <%BoxNavy> 4Head
[2:14:07] <studleydoorite> I always get my pizzas extra melted, especially the dough
[2:14:18] <%Mendin> Break their bones fairly quickly
[2:14:21] <TwoStarPlayersNik> by the other one
[2:14:23] <+Midknightsun316> Pupper down!
[2:14:23] <Ozavic> Pizza juice
[2:14:26] <2DSuperiority> butta dog dog wit the butta
[2:14:32] <+storebrandcandy> liquid pizza
[2:14:34] <%Ipsenscastle> CRAZY TALK
[2:14:34] <DS_ShockTrooper> How hard is this game, I haven't played many xcom like games
[2:14:36] <penitentpendant> Zone Dog 2, The Zogening
[2:14:40] <%Zetheos> the "only heal to 50%" thing in this difficulty gets *brutal* later on
[2:14:43] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's a super good QoL feature
[2:14:50] <heartlesshealer> yeah that's one of the best practical features
[2:14:53] <+Ancisace> It apparently gets hard later
[2:14:56] <TwoStarPlayersNik> I just wish it had more values than 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%
[2:15:02] <Ozavic> @DS_ShockTrooper In my experience it's a bit easier than XCOM
[2:15:09] <%Mendin> Having any healing at all between "pods" of enemies is still amazing
[2:15:09] <penitentpendant> The power of Alphastrike
[2:15:13] <%Promessa_EX> seems like good time for pipegun
[2:15:16] <jeppeww> xcom would be so much better if you played as ducks and boars
[2:15:17] <Dead_Trickster> More Info given to player = Game better than xcom.
[2:15:17] <%crimsonharvest> no these values are great because they're probaly honest
[2:15:17] <Manwad> @DS_ShockTrooper With the stealth, and a bunch of QoL it seems easier than XCOM
[2:15:26] <penitentpendant> 95%, you mean 0%?
[2:15:30] <%pectusumbra> More honest
[2:15:30] <%AzureGale> Mario + Rabbids had it the best with just 100%, 50%, and 0%
[2:15:30] <+TheMorilo> xcom straight up LIES to you
[2:15:31] <%Zetheos> hard agree, Pat
[2:15:32] <+Gespens> Remember how XCOM had 100% accuracy BUT ALSO A HIDDEN 20% DODGE CHANCE?
[2:15:32] <heartlesshealer> xcom gave you lying values
[2:15:32] <DS_ShockTrooper> Ah good, I'm not good at xcom :)
[2:15:34] <%AnthroMetal> lmao yeah XCOM 99.9% Hit only to miss
[2:15:40] <+Jaysky> You don't like missing a 99% shot?
[2:15:42] <%Mendin> Also the game just showed that light/darkness are accuracy modifiers too, nice
[2:15:44] <%Puhff> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[2:15:44] <Dr_Mooose> yup
[2:15:45] <iosephe> or 75 even
[2:15:50] <Ozavic> Lets be fair, I just wish that XCOM didn't fucking lie with it's %to hits
[2:15:51] <T_Sasquatch> Those percentages are nonsense
[2:15:52] <TwoStarPlayersNik> SAVE POINTS
[2:15:53] <%SirGO0SE> thats fair
[2:15:54] <heartlesshealer> yes, @Gespens
[2:15:55] <%Daxalog> 99 isnt 100
[2:16:00] <$RealThiele> 95% *miss*
[2:16:06] <%Zetheos> 100% being a thing feels so nice
[2:16:07] <%crimsonharvest> The original X-Com games could get above 100% accuracy really easy it was awesome
[2:16:09] <goose_coward> more than 50% means yes, hit
[2:16:12] <+Gespens> I still can't get over how XCOM has a hidden evade percentage
[2:16:13] <DS_ShockTrooper> I played Mario + Rabbids kingdom battle is so fun.
[2:16:13] <heartlesshealer> secret dodge percentages on the enemies in xcom
[2:16:17] <TwoStarPlayersNik> you want HOG RUSH
[2:16:22] <Broken_Sonex> @TwoStarPlayersNik NAH, THO
[2:16:23] <%Mendin> Look at that 5 pointer on Borman
[2:16:23] <BlacSoul> I WILL fist fight a dev over a 99% hit missing
[2:16:24] <%Ipsenscastle> that's why Into the Breach is so good, random chance only factors in to positive results
[2:16:26] <%Zetheos> Moth Wings is cool
[2:16:26] <TwoStarPlayersNik> knee shot is garbage
[2:16:28] <T_Sasquatch> 99% irl is practically a 100%
[2:16:29] <%Mendin> And think about it in the context of stealth
[2:16:31] <LVL1_Scumbag> But moth wings tho
[2:16:31] <%Zetheos> it looks hella weird tho
[2:16:40] <heartlesshealer> okay, but look further down the branch too
[2:16:46] <T_Sasquatch> Anyone would bet on a 99% chance
[2:16:47] <penitentpendant> Do you need both upgrades to grab that one?
[2:16:48] <$RealThiele> destroy cover for sniping woo
[2:16:49] <Ozavic> The actives are very good in this game
[2:16:49] <%Promessa_EX> brain dumb
[2:16:50] <%crimsonharvest> its 'autosave after combat' which is a great place for autosave to happen
[2:16:52] <%Mendin> 2 turn stun when an enemy can call reinforcfements is AMAZEBALLS
[2:16:53] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Drawing aggro is probably good when Bormin gets more tanky and you get more party members
[2:16:56] <TwoStarPlayersNik> hog rush is ridiculously OP, it's Bormin's best ability
[2:17:06] <%AzureGale> DOUBLE TAP
[2:17:12] <%BoxNavy> WutFace
[2:17:13] <+ChrisBraps> zesty
[2:17:16] <heartlesshealer> FEED
[2:17:20] <BlacSoul> OM NOM NOM
[2:17:23] <$RealThiele> nomnomnom
[2:17:24] <%blastyoboots> these abilities kick ass
[2:17:24] <%Promessa_EX> that's why certain folks aren't "scurred" of covid
[2:17:26] <Ozavic> WE VORENY NOW BOYS
[2:17:30] <penitentpendant> Just remember, loot THEN eat
[2:17:30] <%BoxNavy> so good it almost killed you
[2:17:32] <ArkanumZilong> Ah yes, this horribly balanced mess of a game.
[2:17:32] <%SirGO0SE> GAS
[2:17:34] <Dead_Trickster> Twitch Shot = I messed up and will die if I don't get this kill.
[2:17:34] <studleydoorite> hate to point this out but 99% is about the survival rate of covid and it's killed too many
[2:17:39] <%crimsonharvest> wait spore cloud gives you automatic smoke wheen you get hit? thats sick
[2:17:39] <%Promessa_EX> even though death is more like 2.5% where i live
[2:17:43] <T_Sasquatch> Ghost dick PogChamp
[2:17:46] <+Pengers> duck
[2:17:49] <%blastyoboots> When you buy your level wait and watch the mutation animation
[2:17:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Moth Wings lets you get the high ground, perhaps?
[2:17:55] <@commanderclaw> I also like the JRPG style approach to party members. You have who you have
[2:17:55] <$RealThiele> clean overwatch
[2:17:57] <%AnthroMetal> yo this music tho
[2:18:10] <TwoStarPlayersNik> hog rush is legit the best ability in the game
[2:18:10] <CptHarlok> @studleydoorite XCOM is one of the reasons a 1% fatality rate scares me.
[2:18:13] <heartlesshealer> I love how the later mutations just make the earlier ones better too
[2:18:18] <TwoStarPlayersNik> 3 levels goes fast
[2:18:21] <%Mendin> Moth Wings let you just go like 15' straight into the air or hover across a gap, yeah
[2:18:58] <%Mendin> How much damage does the hand grenade do?
[2:18:59] <Manwad> do you just become a stack of horrible mutations by endgame?
[2:19:19] <%Mendin> I mean, Manwad, tyou're already a beastperson, so it's a matter of perspective
[2:19:20] <%AnthroMetal> this thing is nailing the atmosphere
[2:19:23] <%Promessa_EX> don't give up skeleton
[2:19:31] <%blastyoboots> is the map helpful anymore?
[2:19:35] <TwoStarPlayersNik> you can upgrade the base damage of your grenades later in the game
[2:19:48] <s1rcuit> yeah, they're ignorant of humanity prior to whatever apocalyptical event occured
[2:19:52] <skyentombment> Listen carefully skeleton
[2:19:54] <%mikessdd> I'm loving the survival game atmosphere
[2:19:54] <Ozavic> @CptHarlok To be fair XCOM cheats with background stats that make you miss if you've been hitting too often (and the reverse)
[2:19:57] <TwoStarPlayersNik> @PatStaresAt you don't even need to walk, you can quicktravel from the map to places you've already been
[2:19:59] <Manwad> @Mendin Yeah, but being a duckman is one thing. Having like more than one animal part is something else.
[2:20:03] <s1rcuit> no
[2:20:05] <heartlesshealer> oh damn that's right. You can just head back in this game
[2:20:05] <psimon_> @Manwad you definetly feel your power rise in the progress of playing ythe game
[2:20:08] <SaltyAzteca> teeedious

[2:20:31] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt there's a dedicated "Back to Ark" button on the map screen

[2:22:12] <%Mendin> @loukemia83 No he said the plague ravaged people for 40 years before everything else went t oshit, I think
[2:22:21] <%Promessa_EX> yeah the glowy eyes on level up
[2:22:22] <%Maids4lyfe> 40 years is long enough for people to forget shit, just look at the US education system
[2:22:27] <%Zetheos> @mikessdd if you don't want to wait, you could check the gameswap subreddits. It's been in a few Humble Bundles
[2:22:47] <%Promessa_EX> it took 40 years for humanity to collapse, not sure how long since then
[2:22:53] <%AnthroMetal> the elder is just pat
[2:22:56] <%Mendin> It was free a time or two on EGS too
[2:23:05] <studleydoorite> the writing's so good for a game about Duckman and Borx
[2:23:09] <%Puhff> Wow white text on off white map is great...
[2:23:09] <Broken_Sonex> That guy in the back is WORKING it
[2:23:12] <Dead_Trickster> Oh she's totally a lizard lady.
[2:23:35] <%Promessa_EX> at least the bro on the left is getting excercise

[2:25:24] <%Maids4lyfe> yeah
[2:25:29] <Broken_Sonex> I wonder what Woolie's head-cake would look like?
[2:25:34] <TwoStarPlayersNik> you will eventually get all of them
[2:25:34] <%walternatorz> I'm still stuck thinking about what an Egg cake is
[2:25:40] <Saltmeisterr> so how u enjoying da game pat?
[2:25:47] <s1rcuit> Hamon
[2:25:54] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[2:25:57] <%Mendin> Probably a mistranslation of "Can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs"
[2:26:01] <TwoStarPlayersNik> That's the DLC pat
[2:26:04] <heartlesshealer> YOU CAN GO THERE AND DIE
[2:26:04] <%MidnightBurst12> oh damn
[2:26:05] <DrStinkers> sign point
[2:26:05] <goose_coward> is that the DLC?
[2:26:07] <%walternatorz> and is an egg cake offensive to ducks or other egg laying species?
[2:26:11] <alwayspronking> lmao the Get smoked zone
[2:26:14] <%baka_sugoi> the burbs

[2:26:15] <@commanderclaw> The DLC is just Laval
[2:26:17] <skyentombment> Is Laval part of the DLC?
[2:26:18] <+storebrandcandy> mausoleum of suburbia is a great album name
[2:26:24] <s1rcuit> probably the latter
[2:26:26] <goose_coward> like in the witcher 3?
[2:26:29] <%Mendin> Hey Pat can you read that note you got earlier mentioning some treasure cache somewhere?
[2:26:30] <TwoStarPlayersNik> you just move from the end of the regular game to the DLC
[2:26:36] <%BoxNavy> it looks like you can just go there
[2:26:44] <heartlesshealer> yeah Mausoleum of Suburbia is a good name
[2:26:53] <skyentombment> @commanderclaw Eyyyy 2Slow , but good shit
[2:27:02] <devanmuse> was that a satellite or a spaceship?
[2:27:17] <TwoStarPlayersNik> @PatStaresAt Trust me, you really wanna go right (optional area), very important chest there

[2:29:30] <%blastyoboots> Why do I find myself wishing she had elk legs? Am I turning into a furry?
[2:29:31] <%Foxsploder> Blew a perfectly good chance to give us a furry girl
[2:29:33] <heartlesshealer> she's here with levels
[2:29:36] <%Promessa_EX> has a venom horn
[2:29:36] <%JamesCorck> I was going to ask if this is a LoU spin off, but there's no way it is. This game looks like it's actually fun to play it.
[2:29:37] <TwoStarPlayersNik> she got some stuff
[2:29:37] <@SoFarFetched> she's almost horny D:
[2:29:38] <%MidnightBurst12> wow

[2:29:55] <%SuperFineButtHairs> SuperFineButtHairs subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! frog lady
[2:29:56] <Zombrocom> She does look like ellie
[2:29:58] <%king_wragles> Looks like she has claws too
[2:29:59] <+Gigagoat> frog legs
[2:30:01] <goose_coward> SHE'S BIG BOSS
[2:30:02] <%ItsCaptainDisco> @blastyoboots Nah, it would just make her character interesting
[2:30:06] <dizimous> Oni?
[2:30:15] <%baka_sugoi> this is now ANIME
[2:30:17] <%Monkeyweed21> she has huge hands
[2:30:24] <%Promessa_EX> lol it'd be cool if you could make her get ore fucked up
[2:30:25] <%DashXero> Double-tap, huh?
[2:30:29] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt attachment
[2:30:29] <TwoStarPlayersNik> it's a weapon mod
[2:30:33] <%SirGO0SE> 30% weapon range woah
[2:30:34] <%crimsonharvest> green eye is the ACOG
[2:30:35] <Kalarchis> Her proportions are weird. Head and hands are too big
[2:30:37] <TwoStarPlayersNik> she got a modded pistol
[2:30:38] <heartlesshealer> weapon mod
[2:30:44] <+mckraven> is this gonna be one of those anthro problems where the male characters get to be full changed but the female characters are just ladies with a small modification
[2:30:48] <goose_coward> good shit
[2:30:55] <Broken_Sonex> @blastyoboots Yeah, because fuck you
[2:30:56] <+black_pariah> question for chat, i seem to remember ads with her having the stone skin, can you swap abilities?
[2:30:56] <Dr_Mooose> calculated
[2:31:00] <%Mendin> @mckraven just wait
[2:31:02] <%Monkeyweed21> more like super pipe gun
[2:31:06] <%THATGUY_789> gripegun
[2:31:08] <%BoxNavy> no, i am
[2:31:09] <TwoStarPlayersNik> and then pat finds a pipegun
[2:31:14] <%Foxsploder> Should have just made her a goat girl or something. HUman waifus are a dime a dozen
[2:31:15] <%SirGO0SE> oo Pat has his fisnets on again today HUBAHUBA
[2:31:35] <%mikessdd> YEah super tendons'
[2:31:38] <%mikessdd> Why not
[2:31:40] <TwoStarPlayersNik> joker is trash
[2:31:46] <heartlesshealer> super tendons is an auto-climb if you need her on a roof, but what was the other?
[2:31:47] <+GundamF91> Very predictable that she isn't a literal creature like them
[2:31:48] <TwoStarPlayersNik> tree hugger is the good skill
[2:31:51] <%vivaldiva> so she's a mountain goat...person?
[2:31:55] <%Mendin> Jet Boots seems p good
[2:32:01] <%AzureGale> WHAT DID YOU DO PAT
[2:32:02] <CrimsonFox777> Her tendons are becoming SUPER
[2:32:03] <%MidnightBurst12> sick
[2:32:08] <Zeif00> WutFace
[2:32:11] <%ghostofsolomon> IS SHE AN ANIMPORPH?
[2:32:18] <goose_coward> girls just do that
[2:32:20] <TwoStarPlayersNik> very good against melee enemies, locks them in place
[2:32:27] <%ionfamous> Joker is good when mixed with Bormin's invincibility. Otherwise, yeah not that great
[2:32:28] <%Promessa_EX> yeah she's not a tank and only one turn is pretty low
[2:32:28] <Ozavic> She's essentially a mutt of a mutant, no one thing is strong enough to change her appearance
[2:32:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Probably
[2:32:38] <heartlesshealer> it's fine
[2:32:39] <%Mendin> You're fine Pat
[2:32:43] <Dr_Mooose> moth wings is good
[2:32:44] <%crimsonharvest> no, there's no cover in the air
[2:32:45] <%mikessdd> I mean according to chat yeah
[2:32:46] <heartlesshealer> giving your sniper movement is fine
[2:32:47] <TwoStarPlayersNik> nah, Dux having lotta movement is good
[2:32:48] <s1rcuit> eh, moth wings are an active
[2:32:49] <%Mendin> The exp will -roll- in
[2:32:49] <dauver> movement range is good too
[2:33:03] <devanmuse> "Why would i ever want to save my points"?
[2:33:10] <%Arxel1> Wait, is Dux chewing a toothpick *with a duck beak* ?
[2:33:12] <TwoStarPlayersNik> three is maximum
[2:33:13] <%mikessdd> anyway...optional area GO!
[2:33:14] <Broken_Sonex> I fucking love that Dux has a toothpick
[2:33:14] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt did you enjoy the new Berserk chapter?
[2:33:20] <dauver> 3 is the active party size
[2:33:23] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt 3's the max for combat, but you get more
[2:33:27] <heartlesshealer> 3 fits the UI beautifully, but also I've never seen past this point
[2:33:29] <@SoFarFetched> Chat ruined berserk for pat
[2:33:29] <Ozavic> For everyone wondering, there ARE furry ladies later
[2:33:31] <@SoFarFetched> cause they would send him SPOILERS
[2:33:43] <%THATGUY_789> 2 hapters behind then
[2:33:44] <+mckraven> @patstaresat so you're only like 10 chapters behind
[2:33:44] <%mikessdd> ye furry ladies
[2:33:46] <%LordSDB> Oh that sucks
[2:33:46] <Palmtuna> @Monkeyweed21 What chapter are is it on?
[2:33:46] <ekkieekk> oh so you have like 10 chapters in backlog
[2:33:46] <@SoFarFetched> Cause people go "HEY PAT HAVE YOU SEEN SPOILER"
[2:33:48] <$dalmek> I will only read Berserk if it finishes, or Miura dies

[2:34:23] <Profmcstevie> HOW DARE YOU EVER BE BEHIND CURRENT MEDIA
[2:34:23] <+black_pariah> before this came out, i remember the devs saying characters could swap perks, is that still a thing?
[2:34:27] <+vicar_anat> Griffith would be proud
[2:34:32] <%SirGO0SE> if something gets spoiled for me i just dont check it out until i forget the spoiler completely

[2:34:57] <BanSenpai> Any thoughts on Jujutsu Kaisen
[2:34:58] <+Ancisace> Pat's exploding on stream
[2:34:58] <s1rcuit> I knew a guy at college who's thing was he would explicitly spoil stories, he didn't even watch the series, he'd just look up the spoilers online
[2:35:04] <KitsuneCrew> What the fuck?? HOT??
[2:35:09] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> Ow 😣
[2:35:10] <%SirGO0SE> what animal would Pat mutate into?

[2:35:21] <%Mendin> toilet
[2:35:21] <TwoStarPlayersNik> @PatStaresAt these ladders are not the optional area, you really wanna do optional area before you go up there

[2:35:29] <%maenos2> pat is a possum
[2:35:29] <%Monkeyweed21> waited 4 months just for some bs with Isidro and Puck
[2:35:29] <ergulor> pat would become a cybor toilet
[2:35:30] <Profmcstevie> Toilet-Bear
[2:35:32] <iosephe> toilet
[2:35:33] <%Captain_Joe1911> psaUp atpToiler

[2:35:41] <TwoStarPlayersNik> understood
[2:35:42] <%Piemono> I once saw a guy start pulling on a ingrown bear hair after shaving his beard, and that thing was like 6 inches long
[2:35:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> @studleydoorite LOL

[2:35:51] <CrimsonFox777> Pat would be lucky if it was an animal he mutated into. He'll probably just become a toilet gremlin.
[2:35:51] <@SoFarFetched> Don't backseat to hard guys.
[2:35:54] <@commanderclaw> I want to touch Gief
[2:35:55] <@SoFarFetched> let him play the game.

[2:36:13] <Profmcstevie> More importantly, who fucking cares if Pat goofs. No backseats, watch fumbles
[2:36:33] <%Jaxnos> i only watch for goofs and hot takes that make my spleen itch
[2:36:36] <%BoxNavy> pat did you know that you play as a duck in this game
[2:36:49] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat should just use his microphone as a buttplug so we can hear all the churning and gurning, he would get a million subs
[2:36:54] <%AzureGale> welp

[2:57:18] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt if you kill one that doesn't share an awareness circle they don't hear it
[2:57:20] <%emperordread> Sorry I fell asleep cause I was comfy, is this game fun?
[2:57:22] <TwoStarPlayersNik> did you equip that robot-stun-mod?
[2:57:32] <%crimsonharvest> is it time for grenade
[2:57:40] <giogio346> @PatStaresAt giantbomb did their goty thing and yakuza and 13 sentinels are in their top 10 if you are curious
[2:57:48] <%ghostofsolomon> is ther a way to distract them?
[2:57:48] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt sorry, that and with a silent weapon
[2:57:50] <%linSP> Is this more like divinity than xcum
[2:58:03] <%kyh9> Is this game any good?
[2:58:04] <%Daxalog> Did that new Eva movie come out yet?
[2:58:11] <s1rcuit> @ghostofsolomon no, you can only change agro
[2:58:16] <+camarada_hidalgo> Yakuza 7 was one of the best games last year
[2:58:20] <%kyh9> 13 Sentinels doesnt seem like anybody's thing until it is
[2:58:22] <TwoStarPlayersNik> sometimes you gotta realize that stealth isn't an option, and in those cases, one should chuck a million grenades in their stupid faces
[2:58:29] <%ghostofsolomon> @s1rcuit thks man i see
[2:58:32] <%Puhff> !uptime
[2:58:32] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 58m.
[2:58:32] <%BoxNavy> thats awesome
[2:58:34] <%kyh9> It's a VN with no self-insert or romance options
[2:58:38] <+staseb> What are the rules about backseat-gaming here? I remember playing this and might have some thoughts.
[2:58:39] <%Monkeyweed21> I cant wait for 13 sentinels to get disqualified cuz "EWW ANIME TITTIES"
[2:58:42] <%Mendin> Hell yeah squad up
[2:59:19] <+camarada_hidalgo> now get the loot in the airplane, that was the helicopter.
[2:59:33] <%SirGO0SE> @staseb generally wait for pat to ask for help, but global tips are always welcome
[2:59:35] <TwoStarPlayersNik> wow lucky crit
[2:59:40] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt use Dux's crit attack on the far right
[2:59:43] <%crimsonharvest> walk lady closer?
[2:59:47] <%SirGO0SE> like the person who just said about the circles
[2:59:54] <GeneralHysterics> OH NO THIS IS XCOM
[3:00:06] <BoxerBrute> thats gonna alert them i think
[3:00:22] <+Kingdom_65> @GeneralHysterics Apparently it's better than XCOM
[3:00:26] <%ghostofsolomon> YEYEYEYE
[3:00:28] <+staseb> got it!
[3:00:30] <+wicketpelican> Level 16 oh wow

[3:00:37] <Saltmeisterr> OVERWATCH?! WutFace
[3:00:44] <%Promessa_EX> pat makes no mistakes
[3:00:53] <TwoStarPlayersNik> skull splitter is guaranteed crit, could work for a silent kill
[3:00:55] <%king_wragles> Ugh, where'd the top hat come from?
[3:01:08] <+camarada_hidalgo> I think we lack of games with this kind of gameplay and exploratory system
[3:01:18] <GeneralHysterics> say it louder, lady
[3:01:22] <GeneralHysterics> I don't think they heard you
[3:01:23] <ergulor> Save
[3:01:24] <+Ancisace> Found it in a crate
[3:01:29] <%SirGO0SE> oh shes big ballin
[3:01:30] <%BoxNavy> who could ever beat her
[3:01:30] <donkymagooterson> are enemies alerted if their awareness circles overlap or does the attacked enemy have to physically be in another enemy's circle?
[3:02:05] <s1rcuit> D
[3:02:11] <TwoStarPlayersNik> even with loud weapons, with enough distance you won't be heard
[3:02:27] <ergulor> if they're in the same circle they will notice their allies dyng
[3:02:30] <%crimsonharvest> how many can you catch in one molotov
[3:02:31] <s1rcuit> @donkymagooterson if you kill them outside of the circle with a silent weapon their allies won't detect you
[3:02:34] <skeletonkingofmanlets> hey, pat, looking especially groomed tonight
[3:02:44] <ergulor> Granade them
[3:02:48] <%Promessa_EX> if you kill all 3 with a nade the med bot would be easy
[3:02:57] <%mikessdd> throw splody things
[3:03:04] <donkymagooterson> cuz the medbot should be safe to attack then I think
[3:03:06] <therealritzreal> i hate this game
[3:03:14] <Dr_Mooose> check your throwables, might have weapon for bot
[3:03:17] <goose_coward> grenade?
[3:03:21] <TwoStarPlayersNik> yo pat they're all standing very close together, just saying
[3:03:23] <gslayer14> do enemies fight eachother if they aren't the same faction?
[3:03:23] <+Nejums> shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[3:03:24] <+GenesisKnight> Grenade time?
[3:03:39] <%BoxNavy> so if the circles are venn-diagraming then thatll alert all the dudes whos circles are touching 🤔
[3:03:41] <+staseb> I remember that level. First real challenge. But well, I will not say more. But I am here. ^^
[3:03:43] <BoxerBrute> i saved scum so many times on this part before i figured it out
[3:04:19] <TwoStarPlayersNik> burn is a DoT
[3:04:24] <%BoxNavy> oh dux has duct tape on his beak
[3:04:29] <%BoxNavy> good one
[3:04:30] <%crimsonharvest> can you pre-deploy smoke from outside their LOS?
[3:04:30] <+Gespens> Prestige Enemy PogChamp
[3:04:33] <+GenesisKnight> Mollies are DoT
[3:04:34] <Dr_Mooose> he big AND strong
[3:04:42] <LVL1_Scumbag> This seems like a target rich environment
[3:04:44] <+wicketpelican> Use fire grenades it will do wonders in most of them
[3:04:53] <+AngriestAngryArtist> that medbot tho
[3:05:04] <heartlesshealer> smoke grenade puts out fires
[3:05:13] <%SirGO0SE> whats the shield mean? resistant?
[3:05:19] <+wicketpelican> Don't you have any rare fire grenqades?
[3:05:20] <%BoxNavy> moon2W

[3:11:41] <ergulor> you killed a 16
[3:11:42] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt give bormin that large gun, it has better range over scatter
[3:11:43] <%THATGUY_789> ma boooyyy
[3:11:52] <%Mendin> That was your first big major encounter, you got a few levels out of it
[3:11:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> consistent damage>>>>>> crit chance
[3:11:57] <%Promessa_EX> 25% more level per level
[3:12:01] <TwoStarPlayersNik> man they're both so good
[3:12:09] <stevenellis386> thats how you level up huh?
[3:12:21] <%Mendin> Maybe drop a point in the lady's HP?
[3:12:23] <goose_coward> destroy cover must be good right?
[3:12:30] <%BoxNavy> HIGHLY cool B)
[3:12:41] <%BoxNavy> are you gonna be comin back to this pat?
[3:12:42] <heartlesshealer> so destroying cover, that can include some fun things that may or may not hurt you if used recklessly
[3:12:50] <%king_wragles> Good swap, Pat
[3:13:01] <%THATGUY_789> there are more
[3:13:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> he already has it
[3:13:14] <%Mendin> Big loots for big shoots

[3:13:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> scurred
[3:13:43] <TwoStarPlayersNik> gotta use medkits
[3:13:44] <s1rcuit> medkit
[3:13:46] <TwoStarPlayersNik> it's how you heal
[3:13:47] <%mikessdd> Visable equipment good. Also wow they really made that fight feel rewarding with all the loot
[3:13:49] <%king_wragles> With the effort they put into those models, @staseb ? I'm not surprised
[3:13:52] <heartlesshealer> can't you just start battle mode whenever?
[3:14:02] <%BoxNavy> how heal...
[3:14:03] <TwoStarPlayersNik> you use medkits from the inventory screen
[3:14:10] <%king_wragles> He found the helmet in the chopper
[3:14:11] <fallacy8> @patstaresat careful when buying abilities. only one type of each at a time
[3:14:14] <TwoStarPlayersNik> there's a button

[3:14:32] <heartlesshealer> cool

[3:15:37] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@staseb) (warning)
[3:15:38] <NitronStreams> I would loke a pizza roll
[3:15:39] <%mikessdd> xcom but with real characters is a good combo

[3:16:16] <%THATGUY_789> it's blue
[3:16:26] <%BoxNavy> where red
[3:16:32] <%mikessdd> combat very xcom
[3:16:33] <heartlesshealer> blurple?
[3:16:34] <DamiexDW> hb yellow?
[3:16:37] <s1rcuit> it's purple
[3:16:38] <%Promessa_EX> orange is better
[3:16:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> dots of red
[3:16:40] <%BoxNavy> you scared the red dot away
[3:16:48] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Where's Woolie and his soda side-hustle when you need him?
[3:16:50] <+Burdenslo> A catheter bag? So he can put soda up his dick?
[3:16:52] <%THATGUY_789> emotiona
[3:16:56] <%mikessdd> exploration and out of combat decidedly not xcom and I like that
[3:16:56] <heartlesshealer> oh yeah new shop items
[3:16:57] <%psidefx> Only heathens green
[3:17:04] <+Ancisace> Somewhere Elmo is holding a laser pointer and giggling
[3:17:05] <TwoStarPlayersNik> when you level up, Iridia's store restocks
[3:17:07] <%THATGUY_789> elmo prime is blue
[3:17:12] <s1rcuit> anyone watch Rem's latest animation?
[3:17:20] <s1rcuit> @THATGUY_789 NO
[3:17:22] <%Monkeyweed21> @Burdenslo drink it like a medical grade Capri Sun
[3:17:25] <+staseb> @king_wragles sure thing. That game is quite a gem. I played it back at launch, when it was more buggy. But still. Such a nice thing. And the best thing: it is compact. On point. No grind, no filler. Just a nice adventure. I hope this franchise has a future.
[3:17:40] <heartlesshealer> yeah feels more real
[3:17:45] <%THATGUY_789> @s1rcuit haha
[3:17:49] <%ChungusQuest> Feels like a shop screen in a Might & Magic game
[3:17:53] <%Tallie> Tallie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! long
[3:17:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> 3 blood bags for this old fuck?
[3:17:59] <+smuggleruncle> game have style
[3:18:05] <%BoxNavy> 🔥 moon2DEV
[3:18:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> true
[3:18:11] <goose_coward> what're ye buyin'?
[3:18:11] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt These talking cutscenes really remind me of Fallout 1 and 2
[3:18:24] <%UvBenServed> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[3:18:26] <%Mendin> I like that there's a little ! for new-in-stock items
[3:18:37] <heartlesshealer> armour
[3:18:39] <%Mendin> the Armoire of Invincibility
[3:18:39] <+Gespens> I had to throw a molotov once for a science experiment in a controlled environment, but the bottle refused to break
[3:18:48] <+staseb> pat is crit-anxious, eh?
[3:18:51] <%THATGUY_789> @s1rcuit Remains
[3:18:54] <+Etherealizer> monkaS
[3:18:55] <%BoxNavy> how manly
[3:18:56] <%ShogunNoonto> robot
[3:19:00] <%Ranryu692> BOO!
[3:19:01] <%Monkeyweed21> the Warframe school of crit
[3:19:02] <%Ranryu692> did that help?
[3:19:02] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> How do you feel about crit damage increases?
[3:19:04] <%SirGO0SE> psaLiz
[3:19:04] <%pectusumbra> Yes, but have you considered that 20% to 30% is the big good though
[3:19:12] <+Burdenslo> @monkeyweed21 a medical Capri sun does sound good
[3:19:13] <%MalekDracarus> What about late game Divinity?
[3:19:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> one more
[3:19:14] <heartlesshealer> any mods for already-silent needle gun?
[3:19:17] <%THATGUY_789> @s1rcuit Rems latest animation was hilarious
[3:19:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> ]pat of the hicups
[3:19:32] <TwoStarPlayersNik> tip: you want a silent weapon to be able to stun robots
[3:19:35] <%Mendin> Ah there's a Y - Dismantle option for (presumably) turning old weapons into scrap
[3:19:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The shaman is already here, in the Ark
[3:19:38] <s1rcuit> @THATGUY_789 sure was, and he gets better each time
[3:19:38] <%Mendin> *weapon part scrap
[3:19:40] <heartlesshealer> does crossbow have any crit?
[3:19:55] <heartlesshealer> nevermind
[3:19:59] <s1rcuit> @heartlesshealer yes it does
[3:20:01] <%THATGUY_789> @s1rcuit so true haha
[3:20:07] <+Burdenslo> Is this game just these 3 characters or I there more?
[3:20:12] <heartlesshealer> thank you
[3:20:16] <%Mendin> more later
[3:20:18] <TwoStarPlayersNik> all three silent weapons have the same damage, but the crossbow only has one shot and the other have two shots
[3:20:26] <+staseb> beware - if you scrap a weapon, there is no unscrap. I once scrapped two of my three silent weapons and fucked myself good for a while.
[3:20:32] <%Mendin> Crossbow has more base range I think
[3:20:33] <RetributionP> when pillars 2
[3:20:39] <%Ipsenscastle> Leprechaun 2: Back 2 da Zone
[3:21:01] <ergulor> corpse eater
[3:21:03] <heartlesshealer> corpse feasting or double shot
[3:21:11] <$Afterman_> corpo eatero
[3:21:11] <heartlesshealer> true
[3:21:14] <%THATGUY_789> @ipsenscastle ha
[3:21:15] <+staseb> are corpses keto?
[3:21:15] <penitentpendant> Time to SAVE
[3:21:15] <s1rcuit> @THATGUY_789 like not in animation quality, but he does a good job using the animation for storytelling/continuity like with the Patroids
[3:21:16] <%Mendin> You can only have one major mutation at a time, though, I think
[3:21:22] <%SirGO0SE> logic good, do it
[3:21:23] <+GenesisKnight> Eat all the enemies
[3:21:26] <TwoStarPlayersNik> keep in mind that you can only have one major mutation active at the same time (set from the inventory screen), so you can't have corpse eater and hog rush active at the same time
[3:21:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> duhmage
[3:21:44] <heartlesshealer> movement is still good when dux has to run away or get in position, it's fine
[3:21:59] <%JobbedBone> is this game like Nox
[3:22:06] <$Afterman_> so is game good\
[3:22:06] <%Mendin> yeah with wings and that +movement dux will be Big Movement
[3:22:07] <+staseb> was he IN the chopper? Was there something in there? I dont remember
[3:22:26] <%THATGUY_789> @s1rcuit agree, his style fits so well to his comedic talent. I was laughing so hard
[3:22:35] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt did you check the inside of the heli?
[3:22:43] <TwoStarPlayersNik> man this game looks so cool
[3:22:51] <+staseb> ah, thx! Good to know.
[3:22:56] <%SirGO0SE> i thought the helmet was in the plane?
[3:22:56] <s1rcuit> sorry, I forgot
[3:22:58] <Northward12> scrap by front truck
[3:23:00] <+Midknightsun316> Yeah, the game looks good
[3:23:17] <%THATGUY_789> a shame man
[3:23:17] <s1rcuit> @THATGUY_789 doesn't hurt that he has so much material to work with in all of those recordings
[3:23:26] <%Mendin> The Fallen Angels: Daraku Tenshi
[3:23:28] <%Monkeyweed21> you can kill the 10 health silent
[3:23:32] <%Movemeister> Taser Face downgraded
[3:23:36] <TwoStarPlayersNik> there's a loooot of dudes here

[3:24:05] <TwoStarPlayersNik> without crits
[3:24:07] <penitentpendant> How many people have silent weapons?
[3:24:10] <%SirGO0SE> this is a sneaking mission
[3:24:26] <%Mendin> Hey Pat, if you can't kill them in one turn, you can Hog Rush to stun the guy and give another turn or two to unload on em
[3:24:30] <%mikessdd> Admittedly you do have 3 silent peepo. So yeah do itttt
[3:24:37] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt hit 'em with the charge
[3:24:39] <%Mendin> It's your Oh Shit button

[3:26:36] <heartlesshealer> kill shaman and get everyone away from medibot I guess
[3:26:39] <%mikessdd> Pat likes it and it seems good to me
[3:26:39] <penitentpendant> Save first so you don't have to rekill that other guy
[3:26:51] <%AzureGale> 1. Lie down. 2. Try not to cry. 3. Cry a lot
[3:26:55] <%Mendin> I think High Hunter is techncially out of overlap at that far range
[3:27:02] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt bormin's charge can stun, preventing them from calling out
[3:27:13] <%Mendin> When closest to you, that is
[3:27:21] <+GenesisKnight> Hunter up top first maybe?
[3:27:50] <%mikessdd> time to workshop it
[3:27:55] <%Piemono> sometimes you just end up muscling through shit
[3:28:08] <TwoStarPlayersNik> he's gonna be sleeping for a while
[3:28:12] <heartlesshealer> shaman knocked out for a couple turns is good
[3:28:19] <penitentpendant> CC plus silent weapons, nice natural combo!
[3:28:23] <+Mottyrob> Daffy Duck, Pumba and Ellie plan to kill a bunch of dudes... That's the joke
[3:28:33] <%SirGO0SE> oh man that hog rush did work
[3:28:38] <TwoStarPlayersNik> reload is one action point, shooting is one
[3:28:39] <heartlesshealer> gotta reload the crossbow
[3:28:41] <TwoStarPlayersNik> you can reload and shoot
[3:28:47] <gslayer14> reload into shoot?
[3:28:58] <%mikessdd> hog rush op
[3:29:01] <+GenesisKnight> That worked?!
[3:29:03] <TwoStarPlayersNik> this is why you want hog rush
[3:29:04] <+Ancisace> PatSavesAt
[3:29:05] <Dr_Mooose> well done
[3:29:06] <ergulor> Save
[3:29:07] <%AzureGale> YAAAAAS
[3:29:07] <heartlesshealer> <3
[3:29:09] <s1rcuit> Feels Pretty Good
[3:29:13] <s1rcuit> by TWRP
[3:29:15] <EASrake> oh that's nto what i expected to happen
[3:29:22] <$Afterman_> knock down is strong affect
[3:29:22] <%strakillias> Save
[3:29:25] <TwoStarPlayersNik> hog rush is stupid
[3:29:25] <%Mendin> Hog Rush is MVP
[3:29:28] <%Monkeyweed21> time to save skub
[3:29:28] <heartlesshealer> confirmed you can try that against medi-bot now
[3:29:29] <penitentpendant> It's nice the AI isn't the usual BS of EVERYONE IS ALERTED
[3:29:34] <%Mendin> Big Save
[3:29:34] <%mikessdd> Nobody noticed a thing
[3:29:43] <%duffusecreature> duffusecreature subscribed with Prime. 
[3:29:49] <psimon_> med bot >
[3:29:56] <%mikessdd> Wow so who needs new Hitman when you've got this shit huh?
[3:30:05] <TrollKing96> Does reloading take a whole turn like shooting does?
[3:30:17] <%SirGO0SE> oh thats a very interesting way to do cooldowns
[3:30:23] <+Ancisace> Means he's not on the same z-axis I think
[3:30:25] <%Mendin> It means three things collectively have to die, I think
[3:30:25] <TwoStarPlayersNik> dotted line - he's on a different floor
[3:30:29] <%Monkeyweed21> blind spot
[3:30:33] <+Mendin> Hog rush has a 3 cooldown and one pip is full
[3:30:34] <s1rcuit> pretty sure it just means that it's a different elevation
[3:30:47] <penitentpendant> Dotted line looks like hearing, while solid red seems like sight
[3:30:50] <wasdknife> the dotted line indecates that they are looking away
[3:30:56] <+dante_must_die_exe> oh man, this game was cool
[3:31:06] <ZComiX> Red Line means in sight. Add line means not insite detectable
[3:31:08] <heartlesshealer> if you need her to, you can have selma climb up and start shit
[3:31:10] <+dante_must_die_exe> this and wasteland 3 were great
[3:31:21] <+loukemia83> Dotted line probably means can't see but can hear?
[3:31:23] <TwoStarPlayersNik> take the chance to stun the robot with bormin?
[3:31:24] <+patel347> is this a good game? I think I got it from a humble bundle once
[3:31:26] <TwoStarPlayersNik> 20%
[3:31:31] <+GenesisKnight> Go back and save
[3:31:34] <%SirGO0SE> are there ways to distract or draw aggro in this?
[3:31:35] <s1rcuit> skull splitter?
[3:31:40] <+Ancisace> Pat likes it and it looks neat.
[3:32:17] <penitentpendant> Haven't been paying attention, do characters auto-reload between fights?
[3:32:37] <%mikessdd> Medbot would still need to run over so gives a bit of time
[3:32:38] <TwoStarPlayersNik> I love how every map presents you with a different scenario, that you just gotta figure out
[3:32:40] <s1rcuit> yes
[3:32:46] <penitentpendant> Huzzah!
[3:32:47] <+patel347> is it a continuous game or does it have a campaign
[3:33:00] <%king_wragles> Don't you have to reload that crossbow manually, Pat?
[3:33:02] <TwoStarPlayersNik> it's a campaign
[3:33:04] <s1rcuit> campaign
[3:33:24] <TwoStarPlayersNik> reload is automatic when you leave combat. in combat you have to reload manually
[3:33:42] <+patel347> hmm ill have to try it out sometime then since i already own itt
[3:33:47] <gslayer14> could use the root on the medbot
[3:33:48] <TwoStarPlayersNik> they can still shoot, but they can't move
[3:33:49] <gslayer14> yea
[3:33:55] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt immobilizes
[3:33:59] <lennonbad> this game any good?
[3:33:59] <%Mendin> Rooted CC
[3:34:04] <%Mendin> Zyra
[3:34:13] <%AzureGale> I bet that tree hugger has made its way into a lot of fanfics :x
[3:34:15] <%Mendin> Oh shit it doesnt use up your turn either, nice
[3:35:10] <gslayer14> flankers will be dead next turn tho
[3:35:20] <%SirGO0SE> @AzureGale more like tree luver TehePelo
[3:35:24] <%Monkeyweed21> flanker dies next turn
[3:35:24] <penitentpendant> So it seems strategically, if your last character on a surprise round can't kill a target, you should switch to loud weapons since they'll alert the group anyway. Neat.
[3:36:22] <TwoStarPlayersNik> I like how every map has a point where you have to accept that you can't get any more stealth kills, and it's time to start the firefight
[3:36:33] <s1rcuit> it doesn't
[3:36:49] <EASrake> That's for medicinal purposes :)
[3:36:51] <%Mendin> A medical hatchet
[3:36:54] <gslayer14> it's a healing hatchet
[3:36:58] <%Mendin> Bonesaw, probably
[3:36:59] <@SoFarFetched> Its time to "AXE" him a question
[3:36:59] <%Dwarven_Gaming> its got a knife
[3:37:05] <%Mendin> it is ReaDEE
[3:37:05] <+squidlord482> Crazy Talk activated
[3:37:14] <%SirGO0SE> @SoFarFetched -2
[3:37:16] <penitentpendant> I mean, 'SawBones' is slang for doctors
[3:37:17] <%baka_sugoi> cut ppl to heal
[3:37:20] <+Ancisace> Oh yeah. CPH.
[3:37:20] <%Piemono> To get through bones
[3:37:21] <BlkFlameKami> you can let it be
[3:37:22] <%pectusumbra> What, you've never heard of a bone saw?
[3:37:25] <gslayer14> gotta cut those gangrenous limbs off
[3:37:26] <EASrake> There's one in surgeon simulator Kappa
[3:37:26] <s1rcuit> ...in the 1800's maybe
[3:37:27] <@SoFarFetched> yeah if you need to get through bones Pat
[3:37:38] <%Mendin> Medical hatchets are not real I do not think
[3:37:38] <+Ancisace> Cardio Pulmonary Hacchetry
[3:37:39] <+Eizack> Of course it's a real concept, haven't you played surgeon simulator?
[3:37:42] <%Mrbaconator> pat didn't you know getting hit by a hatchet heals people
[3:37:49] <TwoStarPlayersNik> medbot gotta die
[3:37:52] <+squidlord482> Bone Saw is ready!
[3:37:52] <%mikessdd> By the time medboy runs out to heal you should be able to finish him
[3:38:10] <EASrake> that armor is killer
[3:38:16] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt hog rush the medbot
[3:38:28] <%bhp_99> looks like the bot is gonna revive the guy its on
[3:38:30] <%Mendin> Borman has Run & Gun
[3:38:35] <TwoStarPlayersNik> hog rush is still on cooldown
[3:38:39] <CharmSovereign> medical for the one weilding it
[3:38:44] <+erknen> shoot gun at bad poeople
[3:38:57] <+Ancisace> Have you tried winning?
[3:39:05] <%mikessdd> got em
[3:39:09] <%Mendin> Hog Rush recharged
[3:39:12] <Northward12> now tyouy can rush right?
[3:39:19] <%Mendin> That was the third kill
[3:39:22] <%mikessdd> RUSH
[3:39:24] <+Ipsenscastle> Pog Rush
[3:39:29] <TwoStarPlayersNik> yeah kills give universal cooldown for all party members
[3:39:53] <TwoStarPlayersNik> hog rush is indeed back
[3:40:01] <$StrawberryPantsu> Bit OP tbh
[3:40:04] <+Gespens> hog rush feels a bit too strong lol
[3:40:06] <Dr_Mooose> strong ability
[3:40:12] <%mikessdd> shoot em while he's down!
[3:40:12] <+GenesisKnight> Shoot him in the dick
[3:40:20] <TwoStarPlayersNik> hog rush is so, so unfair
[3:40:24] <+Ancisace> If you could do it every turn it'd be bullshit
[3:40:28] <penitentpendant> I assume in higher tier encounters there'll be enemies too big to Hog Rush for balance
[3:40:30] <%Mendin> I guess because of the kill based CD instead of time-based, and the need for stealth vs huge mobs, you get the power
[3:40:37] <+Gespens> also I'm surprised there isn't like, a perk that lets you stomp on downed enemies
[3:40:39] <TwoStarPlayersNik> wooooo
[3:40:47] <%mikessdd> That felt like a fair fight
[3:40:55] <%chambatron> mothman
[3:41:01] <%anticrust> now give the duck the top hat @PatStaresAt
[3:41:06] <%SirGO0SE> it looks like upgrades give them tummy ache :(
[3:41:11] <%Mendin> Hey see if Borman's HP up is 1 point or if he gets more per
[3:41:13] <%Mendin> due to being a tank
[3:41:15] <RyuuAoi> This isn't DMC2...disappointed
[3:41:20] <%anticrust> YAY
[3:41:22] <LVL1_Scumbag> I was hoping it would show the wings sprouting out of him
[3:41:25] <%anticrust> DUCK GET HAT
[3:41:36] <gslayer14> scrooge
[3:41:47] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> Duck is dapper as fuck now
[3:41:52] <+GenesisKnight> Do medbots always drop medkits
[3:41:57] <EASrake> I'm really surprised the game is structure like this
[3:42:01] <penitentpendant> Dapper Duck is go
[3:42:04] <TwoStarPlayersNik> Duck in the tower, duck in the tower
[3:42:04] <+Burdenslo> Why give more range to pigu? He can’t hit anything
[3:42:06] <%Mendin> Tarnish Notte the majesty of the Towering Hatte
[3:42:10] <+erknen> ScroogemcDuck aint playin' no more
[3:42:23] <%mikessdd> This gameplay loop is really appealing
[3:42:40] <$Afterman_> rip paige
[3:42:42] <+GenesisKnight> Sniper build
[3:42:42] <EASrake> uh oh
[3:42:43] <Dr_Mooose> monkaS

[3:43:08] <%chambatron> Satsui no paige
[3:43:11] <+GenesisKnight> RIP Paige
[3:43:12] <%Mendin> Also more range on pigman probably means that midrange shots are now closer-range and might be more accurate
[3:43:14] <Rionxgarland> ooh shit that pat chibi is new
[3:43:15] <%mikessdd> Something else made of glass has borken probably
[3:43:18] <%Ipsenscastle> Paige crushed by dog
[3:43:23] <RyuuAoi> I hope she's alright though.
[3:43:24] <Dr_Mooose> gief grew too powerful
[3:43:28] <s1rcuit> wind blew the door open; *Paige has died*
[3:43:35] <+Jaysky> It's likely the dog
[3:43:40] <%Mendin> the Siberian Blizzard finally hit
[3:43:52] <+Burdenslo> Zangief piledrive Paige in the kitchen
[3:43:59] <+staseb> damn. I missed the crash. How did it sound? Did the mic pick it up?

[3:47:32] <Meltgar> Huh, how's this game thoug, is it an rp or something?
[3:47:33] <%SirGO0SE> theyre just hanging out :)
[3:47:39] <%SaiyanShoto> I wonder who the more stern parent is between Pat and Paige
[3:47:40] <+burntbagels13> environments look like last of us
[3:47:41] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt you need to start strength training to protect the rest of the family from Zangief
[3:47:51] <+GenesisKnight> THE CAVE OF FEAR?!
[3:47:52] <gslayer14> this looks like a fuck you tunnel
[3:47:53] <psimon_> this game has atmosphere up the ass
[3:48:25] <+silentblast93> geif learned that he is stronger than pat
[3:48:26] <+burntbagels13> Is this game basically embrace MONKE?
[3:48:31] <+Ancisace> Looks like a lot of overgrowth for a completely dark tunnel
[3:48:31] <%Dakuu75> dude, that'd happen in 2 or less
[3:48:32] <Meltgar> It's apocalypse overgrowth Pat, Kappa
[3:48:34] <devanmuse> has it really only been 40 years?
[3:48:35] <s1rcuit> seems like under growth to me
[3:48:38] <%Monkeyweed21> overgrowth is really fast
[3:48:38] <%Piemono> why start calling people "Ancients" after 40yrs?
[3:48:44] <%SirGO0SE> its not enough tbh
[3:48:44] <LVL1_Scumbag> I don't know, grass grows pretty aggressively
[3:48:45] <Northward12> scrap past that medkit
[3:48:51] <%ChungusQuest> We Ancients have been on record making poor decisions.
[3:48:55] <Mr_Rakjo> dude have you seen pictures of abandoned towns. Plants take over fast as fuck @PatStaresAt
[3:49:09] <s1rcuit> @Piemono because education isn't much of a thing
[3:49:16] <%mikessdd> bobble heads?
[3:49:17] <%ElkRiverDog> The weeds in my yard would disagree with your assessment
[3:49:18] <%SirGO0SE> plants do be growin
[3:49:24] <%Monkeyweed21> it takes like 2 or 3 years tops for grass to break through concrete
[3:49:26] <psimon_> if the conbditions are there, wind, humidity and concrete that begins to crack it's not that unrealistic i think
[3:49:26] <%ChungusQuest> These guys sound like TTS characters, it's fucking great
[3:49:29] <+Jaysky> That sounded like Metal Face
[3:49:29] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> chat are pat's vods still sub only?
[3:49:42] <%Arxel1> I mean, the plague was a 40 years thing. Who knows how much longer passed *after* that
[3:49:42] <+Gespens> does elevation give a range boost
[3:49:50] <CharmSovereign> this what happens when you dont shave for forty years
[3:49:56] <%mikessdd> for real did sound like metal face
[3:49:57] <%Burdenslo> The vods usually end up on the youtubes
[3:50:00] <%king_wragles> Doesn't Dux have the elevation crit hat?
[3:50:00] <s1rcuit> @Monkeyweed21 grass don't got time for pussy shit like concrete

[3:53:18] <%ChungusQuest> "Yeah, any snake over $50 years for the beyond"
[3:53:30] <CharmSovereign> santa isreal
[3:53:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Like, you can replace a stuffed animal or something, but it's fucked to do with something that's alive and aware
[3:53:53] <LVL1_Scumbag> The best save scumming on Twitch
[3:53:57] <%Monkeyweed21> save skub
[3:54:39] <%Monkeyweed21> only pro skubbers save scum
[3:54:47] <CharmSovereign> its because its no longer aware or alive that you replace it
[3:55:08] <Hyphixsys> this game is adorable for some reason, can't explain it LUL
[3:55:17] <LVL1_Scumbag> Are you telling me there are filthy skub plebs in this chat?
[3:55:20] <penitentpendant> Also compared to XCOM, the number of times you've hit with a 75% chance feels pleasantly high.
[3:55:24] <%mikessdd> big bomba?
[3:55:29] <+Ancisace> Green crosses. I like that this game respects the Geneva convention
[3:55:43] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Seriously though, imagine being Anti Skub LUL
[3:55:49] <Meltgar> Hi level thoug
[3:55:58] <TwoStarPlayersNik> pyros encourage you to not have your party members stand super close together
[3:56:07] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt Pyro's immune to fire and have Mollies

[3:57:00] <penitentpendant> By the power of CC!
[3:57:25] <%Daxalog> You guys excited for the eva movie tmrw?
[3:57:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @king_wragles Hey man, skub is the Universal Truth and if you can't recognize that then I pity you.
[3:57:31] <%Maids4lyfe> psaGiefrail
[3:57:33] <%mikessdd> BOMBA
[3:57:39] <@SoFarFetched> Eva movie got delayed indefinitely b ecause of COVID
[3:57:41] <%Burdenslo> Porkins is goin ham
[3:57:58] <+Ancisace> what the heck is Eva, is that a tournament?
[3:57:59] <%king_wragles> @SoFarFetched hold on, there's ANOTHER one?
[3:58:07] <Hyphixsys> ooof
[3:58:09] <@SoFarFetched> that 3.0 +1.0 one
[3:58:12] <%Ipsenscastle> @Valentinius_Anodyne get a job, skub-lover
[3:58:16] <%Daxalog> oh
[3:58:18] <TwoStarPlayersNik> moth wings works a bit different from how you think it works
[3:58:36] <TwoStarPlayersNik> you can't go very far with it. it's basically just used to give you a guarateed shot from high ground
[3:58:37] <%king_wragles> @Ancisace Neon Genesis: Evangeleon (Usually called EVA)
[3:58:48] <@SoFarFetched> Eva is just easier to write or people say NGE
[3:58:57] <Meltgar> JUST LIKE XCOM LUL annoying
[3:59:09] <+Ancisace> @king_wragles Ohh,g otcha. It's an anime con :p
[3:59:09] <Sol_Install> nice
[3:59:17] <penitentpendant> Cooking Porkins
[3:59:19] <TonyFriendzoney> Human party member?? D R O P P E D
[3:59:20] <Hyphixsys> 65% hit chance Kappa
[3:59:23] <%bevyrage> bormin can charge remember
[3:59:24] <Sol_Install> would be funny if that car blow up
[3:59:33] <devanmuse> next time: stun the healer FIRST
[3:59:33] <%mikessdd> okay so. they splode, also. should've locked down medbot
[3:59:33] <PaPaSeppuku> roast pork
[3:59:43] <%Monkeyweed21> roots
[3:59:44] <gslayer14> root next time?
[4:00:00] <psimon_> i fucking said it LUL med first
[4:00:00] <Hyphixsys> Kappa
[4:00:11] <gslayer14> rootin tootin
[4:00:14] <penitentpendant> It's nice that CC is so effective for this game
[4:00:25] <%mikessdd> yeah remember you have TWO characters who can immobilize
[4:00:32] <penitentpendant> Makes it feel more tactical outside of the usual Alphastrike meta
[4:00:54] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Not trying to backseat, but you're really giving up your range advantage
[4:01:12] <lol_red_ranger> gunt spotted
[4:01:30] <%king_wragles> @penitentpendant so that made me immediately think "no wait, Pat has to have something that has way too much heat to alpha"
[4:01:40] <+staseb> maybe circle all the way around, slam the bot?
[4:01:40] <gslayer14> need to perfect that pixel
[4:01:48] <Dr_Mooose> doesn't dux get boost on high ground now?
[4:01:51] <+Ancisace> Daaaang
[4:02:26] <+Troispoint> LUL
[4:02:31] <penitentpendant> Locked in!
[4:02:48] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> psaHoldon Run it back!
[4:02:53] <%bevyrage> yeah it changes based on awareness
[4:02:54] <%Alazull> I mean it seems like he has a longer range character, a decent medium range and the pig dude has short range with charge.
[4:02:58] <%king_wragles> Ya, but his long range is less long since he doesn't have the visor @staseb
[4:03:10] <TwoStarPlayersNik> a bit janky, but if it works it works
[4:03:14] <+staseb> the pulse grows, when you are active. Allows you to ditch in cover last second, keeps you from searching the magic pixels like before.
[4:03:56] <penitentpendant> @Alazull It's mostly that closer range allows you to have 100% accuracy, which can be far more valuable since enemies move pretty quick in this
[4:04:42] <%Alazull> @penitentpendant Word, I should've made sure to say in my opinion when I signaled pat
[4:05:08] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It always feels good to lockdown enemies
[4:05:29] <%Alazull> That robot sounds a little like HK
[4:06:26] <Hyphixsys> MedBot becoming DedBot Kappa
[4:06:35] <+GenesisKnight> yep
[4:06:36] <%Alazull> Yes
[4:06:37] <rjhascancer> yup
[4:06:37] <Meltgar> DEAD
[4:06:42] <%AzureGale> I herd that too
[4:06:42] <TwoStarPlayersNik> "suppository applied"
[4:06:42] <%Alazull> It absolutely did
[4:06:43] <%king_wragles> So your butt can be healthy!
[4:06:43] <%rekinom> That's one thorough medbot
[4:06:45] <Saltmeisterr> YEAH BUTT PILLED
[4:06:46] <gslayer14> ANAL HEALING IN PROGRESS.......
[4:06:47] <lol_red_ranger> butt damage Kreygasm
[4:06:52] <%Alazull> Revival via anal insertion
[4:06:55] <+staseb> or 2 hp
[4:06:55] <Elsewize> Human woman, in MY mutant game?
[4:06:57] <s1rcuit> combat suppository
[4:06:58] <penitentpendant> Healing Suppository brings people back from the dead, you're doing them a favor by stopping that bot.
[4:06:59] <heybenice> Heal from within
[4:07:02] <17crawls1> Yoo, first time actually catching you live! How's the game so far??
[4:07:03] <%Monkeyweed21> what do you think medkits are?
[4:07:06] <%vivaldiva> the medical hatchet is a suppository SeemsGood
[4:07:09] <Timbroome> Some days, you feed on a treee frog
[4:07:19] <TwoStarPlayersNik> I don't think frog legs are that impressive, but it does unlock the next tier. Is that good?
[4:07:20] <ChamoCamouflage> Can you both use Hog Rush and Corpse Eater?
[4:07:21] <%Ipsenscastle> How do you think Phoenix Down works, Pat?
[4:07:26] <Hyphixsys> NAISU
[4:07:28] <gslayer14> corpse eater makes you lose hog rush though
[4:07:30] <%AzureGale> If I had to choose between dying and living by having something stuck up my butt... I'd go with the latter
[4:07:32] <+GenesisKnight> Rail gun!
[4:07:34] <%mikessdd> remember pat you cant use both
[4:07:37] <Dr_Mooose> real sniper Pog
[4:07:37] <TwoStarPlayersNik> you can switch mutations between combat
[4:07:39] <%Alazull> JANK RAIL GUN
[4:07:44] <penitentpendant> Eh, 1 ammo clip
[4:07:48] <%bevyrage> AMADEUS
[4:07:56] <lol_red_ranger> oh fuck this tunnel fucking sucks good luck
[4:07:56] <TwoStarPlayersNik> this thing has MASSIVE range
[4:07:59] <bleugh> metal slug
[4:08:07] <%ephie_aka_pulpy> I fucking love metal sug
[4:08:12] <+GenesisKnight> Range 20. Sniper rail gun
[4:08:21] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt State Switcher is NOT a silent weapon so be careful of that
[4:08:22] <gslayer14> yeah, it's a sniper
[4:08:28] <%mikessdd> Big range
[4:08:34] <gslayer14> so you don't have to worry about repostitioning
[4:08:35] <super_robo_mg> one shot's all you need DatSheffy
[4:08:37] <TwoStarPlayersNik> that rifle is for the sniper in the tower
[4:08:37] <%Alazull> Weird that it had lower crit damage tho
[4:08:42] <gslayer14> so you can reload same turn
[4:08:43] <+staseb> free range estate!
[4:08:44] <%bevyrage> i feel it'd replace crossbow since you got other peeps with silent guns
[4:08:55] <%DeadManProp> What the fuck is this game?
[4:08:59] <%Monkeyweed21> dux is your best sniper
[4:09:03] <TwoStarPlayersNik> nah, you definitely want all three to have silent weapons
[4:09:11] <%Alazull> Yeah dude you want that good ambush
[4:09:14] <super_robo_mg> big silent
[4:09:19] <psimon_> thats the play
[4:09:31] <penitentpendant> @bevyrage On an ambush round, if every person has a silent weapon you can have them all attack without alerting nearby enemies
[4:09:34] <%Monkeyweed21> item up there
[4:09:43] <%gear1033> Grenades are really useful
[4:09:52] <gslayer14> wonder if theres an aggro range on loud weapons
[4:09:54] <Dr_Mooose> that's its base range too
[4:10:04] <%bevyrage> ah
[4:10:57] <Meltgar> THE SHINY one
[4:11:46] <penitentpendant> Hello Anti-Heal-Bot Weaponry
[4:11:52] <TwoStarPlayersNik> emp grenades are very very good
[4:12:12] <%barrakuta371> I just realized that Iridia's sitting in a Herman Miller chair
[4:12:13] <penitentpendant> If EMP Grenades were stealth they'd be hilariously useful
[4:12:43] <TwoStarPlayersNik> they are
[4:13:01] <Saltmeisterr> The consumables don't mess with ur goblin brain @PatStaresAt ?
[4:13:03] <TwoStarPlayersNik> they stun robots without alerting people
[4:13:14] <Hyphixsys> man, sound design in this game is nice
[4:13:23] <psimon_> ye emp nades are trash especially towards the end Kappa
[4:13:27] <gslayer14> gonna trash all your bad guns?
[4:14:10] <%Breaknoon> THE GAPER
[4:14:12] <TwoStarPlayersNik> emp grenades are a godsend before you get the abilities to take out robots, and even after they're a nice backup in case you miss with your abilities
[4:14:19] <penitentpendant> Now, what to upgrade?
[4:14:20] <%Alazull> Bringing the floor up, Mediocrates
[4:14:23] <super_robo_mg> how far into the game are we?
[4:14:26] <QuietSandshrew> Oh Lordy
[4:14:27] <%UvBenServed> Need long range gaping
[4:14:28] <%SirGO0SE> its the best. get gaped
[4:14:30] <Dr_Mooose> can gape from afar now
[4:14:43] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The size and range of Pat's Gaper grows by the minute
[4:14:53] <%gear1033> @patstaresat why don't you dismantle the weapons your not using?
[4:14:58] <%Alazull> That seems rulllll good
[4:14:59] <penitentpendant> That grenade one is nice
[4:14:59] <donkymagooterson> that grenade one is the stuff
[4:15:05] <%Burdenslo> Get out of here stalker
[4:15:14] <Dr_Mooose> there's the goblins
[4:15:16] <%SirGO0SE> now those are the goblins
[4:15:20] <TwoStarPlayersNik> your starter weapons are junk tho
[4:15:27] <psimon_> @super_robo_mg to long ago. my estimate is 30%
[4:15:32] <%Sendrak70> If you arnt using them now, you wont use them later.
[4:15:35] <PaPaSeppuku> just scrap the shitty duplicates
[4:15:36] <gslayer14> objective trash
[4:15:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat would you ever stream one of the STALKER games?
[4:15:52] <super_robo_mg> @psimon_ thanks
[4:15:56] <%Alazull> Is the weapon upgrade like just standard plus damage and range?
[4:16:04] <%SirGO0SE> i can see this physically hurts Pat LUL
[4:16:22] <ergulor> imo keep these ones
[4:16:22] <+GenesisKnight> The pain
[4:16:27] <%MrPedrovsky> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[4:16:28] <TwoStarPlayersNik> don't worry, you'll scrap way better weapons later
[4:16:28] <penitentpendant> Pat vs Goblins: Pat 1, Goblins 204832
[4:16:28] <Valentinius_Anodyne> There you go, baby steps
[4:16:29] <super_robo_mg> that gun was the key to the good ending Kappa
[4:16:34] <jeffishype> upgrade silent wpns?
[4:16:49] <+TheotherKristian> It's hard to believe that Yakuza LAD and Persona 5 S may have just switched genres.
[4:16:53] <%mikessdd> Pat cutting off his limbs over here
[4:16:54] <donkymagooterson> how could you Pat WutFace
[4:16:56] <%rekinom> Good job Pat, proud of you 🤗
[4:16:58] <TwoStarPlayersNik> more silent damage is as safe as an investment can get
[4:16:58] <penitentpendant> Good QoL, doesn't let you nuke your equipped weapons
[4:17:00] <+GenesisKnight> Yes
[4:17:00] <%SirGO0SE> @penitentpendant come back time Kappa
[4:17:01] <PaPaSeppuku> Breaking news: small red man refuses to throw out trash
[4:17:08] <CureMode_> this game is good but short
[4:17:10] <%Alazull> Seems like a good idea
[4:17:21] <%Alazull> Make is so your ambush counts for more
[4:17:32] <%Alazull> Pipegun?
[4:17:34] <TwoStarPlayersNik> you'll be rocking these silent weapons for a long time, might as well upgrade them
[4:17:35] <%Levin_godd> Levin_godd subscribed with Prime. 
[4:17:38] <%Captainahab_37> isn't this related to another game?
[4:17:41] <Dr_Mooose> yep
[4:17:44] <penitentpendant> The more you stealth alphastrike, the less you need to heal
[4:17:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> Wow upgrades only make number go up by one? That's wild
[4:18:00] <+GenesisKnight> Is it the "What if I find this out in the zone" feel?
[4:18:08] <+chaumiester> Oh cool. what is this game. It looks neat
[4:18:12] <TwoStarPlayersNik> iridia is for grenades and medkits, that's what you primarily want to spend your scrap on
[4:18:24] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt No upgrade for Pipegun?
[4:18:25] <TwoStarPlayersNik> oh it's a good one
[4:18:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> polis
[4:18:41] <penitentpendant> Even if this game is ultimately short, I give it credit for the level of polish it has
[4:18:42] <%SirGO0SE> uh oh...Paige keep it in your pants

[4:19:23] <%Burdenslo> Welcome to... the BONEZONE psaSkelmo
[4:19:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> pipegun is a good girl
[4:19:31] <donkymagooterson> anyone know if Pat is planning to play through the whole game or if this is a one-off?
[4:19:36] <gslayer14> e v e n t u a l l y
[4:19:48] <psimon_> i mean if weapons do 6 dmg by default and an upgrade gives +1 , thats kind of a lot. not even taking other stats into account
[4:19:55] <Dr_Mooose> huge evil thorns

[4:20:16] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt By the way thanks for showing off this game. It's been on my periphery for a while but never grabbed my attention.
[4:20:16] <TwoStarPlayersNik> it's a fedora :)
[4:20:20] <%mikessdd> YE
[4:20:24] <%Sendrak70> That plant growth is not normal he says. As he pilots his duck man Dux, who is feeling extra fancy today with his top hat.
[4:20:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> fisher hat
[4:20:26] <AiiFapi> AiiFapi subscribed with Prime. 
[4:20:26] <penitentpendant> Of course the Fertility Crown gives more crit damage from stealth
[4:20:31] <Ragnorok64> Is he wearing the fishnet pants again?
[4:20:35] <%KaijuUltimax> DONT PUT THE FERTILITY CROWN ON THE WAMEN

[4:21:59] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Sounds trustworthy, maybe you should listen
[4:21:59] <%mikessdd> oh is that the bobble heads?
[4:22:06] <%king_wragles> @mikessdd less save scumming if more med kit
[4:22:09] <gslayer14> something to test, if a medkit has an aoe heal in combat, it might be more efficient to heal the group in the ambush round, if the enemy is weak & solo
[4:22:09] <%king_wragles> grammar goodly me do
[4:22:16] <SophisticHades> thats a voice of a man I can trust
[4:22:26] <%king_wragles> Right?

[4:25:42] <Dr_Mooose> for goofs
[4:25:42] <%Alazull> That sounds fun
[4:25:45] <%Broand> are those available level ups I see there
[4:25:50] <+GenesisKnight> "I'm so far away I don't even need my silenced weapons!"
[4:25:54] <%BigCoffee> ffs pat
[4:25:54] <%Alazull> Lying to yourself for fun is an interesting approach
[4:26:05] <%mikessdd> crazy talk
[4:26:07] <donkymagooterson> recreational lying
[4:26:10] <penitentpendant> @Broand Some skills require multiple level up points to buy
[4:26:41] <gslayer14> a strat could be beginning an engagement with the sniper in high cover, then leaving the others in flanking spots
[4:26:41] <%Dakuu75> this is giving me some last of Us vibes.
[4:26:52] <jumpyhugs> I just got here, and am getting strong Commandos vibes, am I right?

[4:27:47] <%AzureGale> "These guys fuck: - Pat
[4:28:14] <%watts121> When I saw the trailers for this years ago I thought it was an action adventure game.
[4:28:19] <jumpyhugs> @ReallyBigRocks that's a good encapsulation, thank you
[4:28:34] <%AzureGale> In the post-apocalypse you can do whoever you want
[4:28:35] <penitentpendant> The other mook seems to have pathed away
[4:28:36] <+GenesisKnight> did the other ugy leave
[4:28:39] <Torgue_1> No, one left earlier
[4:28:58] <Dr_Mooose> smooth
[4:28:58] <penitentpendant> Stealth Bacon
[4:29:02] <%Dakuu75> so how's the story in this game?
[4:29:04] <LorcaNomad> monkaS
[4:29:41] <penitentpendant> Praise the stealth!
[4:29:46] <%SirGO0SE> man i love her attitude
[4:29:56] <super_robo_mg> good job, but what about the 7 other dudes you can't see? Kappa
[4:30:36] <%MrPedrovsky> Dog Snore psaDogchamp

[4:31:01] <%KaijuUltimax> psaDogchamp
[4:31:10] <+kj_Clayface> What the hell have i stumbled upon? This shit looks sweet
[4:31:22] <%goose_attack_almanac> Snoring psaDogchamp
[4:31:33] <psimon_> noooo
[4:31:56] <TwoStarPlayersNik> and you can only use abilities in combat
[4:32:05] <penitentpendant> Oof
[4:32:12] <TwoStarPlayersNik> there's a trick tho
[4:32:16] <%emperordread> whomp whomp
[4:32:16] <TwoStarPlayersNik> leave bormin here
[4:32:23] <%GarbageNirvana> thought today's pog was Steve for a minute
[4:32:25] <TwoStarPlayersNik> then walk away with dux and go close to an enemy and start combat
[4:32:26] <penitentpendant> Oh yeah, cheese it
[4:32:32] <TwoStarPlayersNik> then eat the corpse, then leave combat
[4:32:51] <donkymagooterson> corpse eater is great on paper
[4:32:58] <penitentpendant> Fair
[4:33:00] <%MrPedrovsky> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[4:33:04] <Dr_Mooose> honorable pat
[4:33:16] <TwoStarPlayersNik> fair enough
[4:33:21] <donkymagooterson> oxymoron
[4:33:25] <morow1ec> Corpse eater can also deny resurects
[4:33:28] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Cannibalism is great in principle, less so in practice.
[4:33:32] <+MegaBenXZ> This lady's head is so oddly shapped
[4:33:33] <%TIME_PUNCHER> even in games
[4:33:33] <s1rcuit> what up
[4:33:37] <LVL1_Scumbag> Can you not eat corpses out of combat?
[4:33:50] <penitentpendant> Tough choice for that one
[4:33:51] <arikk42> Hi angriest Pat !
[4:33:52] <TwoStarPlayersNik> you cannot
[4:33:55] <LVL1_Scumbag> Cause that's lame
[4:33:57] <RyuuAoi> BET #sponsors Pat
[4:33:59] <%mikessdd> only in combat apparently
[4:34:00] <+MegaBenXZ> Pat looks like he was electrocuted
[4:34:07] <TwoStarPlayersNik> both abilities are very good
[4:34:13] <%MrPedrovsky> @patstaresat You can cancel Necron’s Reanimation Protocol with corpse eater
[4:34:17] <%Burdenslo> I eat my corpses while staring in the eyes of his friends
[4:34:58] <TheBeanBox> Hey from the UK, what's this Pat?
[4:35:04] <%bevyrage> brother bodin was lv 26???
[4:35:12] <%AzureGale> Just like real life
[4:35:12] <Torgue_1> Yep
[4:35:14] <+GenesisKnight> Tactics pay off
[4:35:17] <rawrmeowxd> Yoooooooooooo
[4:35:19] <penitentpendant> @Burdenslo I mean, I've had people call me 'corpse eater' while eating a burger. I bought another burger that day.
[4:35:23] <%mikessdd> Health 26
[4:35:25] <%Dakuu75> but can you tune your upgrades to make the "guns blazing" plan, work?
[4:35:27] <Torgue_1> Pat, what difficulty are you playing on?
[4:35:30] <Dr_Mooose> brother bodin is no joke
[4:35:32] <%bevyrage> oh nvm he has 26 hp
[4:35:32] <%KaijuUltimax> Yeah, but unlike Xcom, stealth is much easier to maintain in this game
[4:35:33] <%AzureGale> Nooooooo anything but Destiny
[4:35:39] <%mikessdd> lvl 10
[4:35:44] <donkymagooterson> there is a real puzzle feel to this game
[4:35:58] <%SirGO0SE> I'm beautiful? :)
[4:36:00] <+black_pariah> i remember seeing this area in previews, theres a shit-ton of enemies here
[4:36:08] <arikk42> Hey Pat you're Canadian but i never heard you ever mention Jagged Alliance 2 when you talked with Woolie on Podcast about all the great TBT games, why is that ? this game is made by Sir-Tech.
[4:36:11] <%mikessdd> still yeah that's 10 more health than the most we've seen up to this point
[4:36:11] <Sunstalker> You are breathtaking PogChamp
[4:36:22] <%Dakuu75> imagine humans going extinct then being called ancients. we'd be the dumbest ancients ever
[4:36:28] <%Burdenslo> @penitentpendant was it a human burger?
[4:36:40] <%AzureGale> Fight teim
[4:36:41] <rawrmeowxd> YO PAT YOU HYPED FOR RE VILLAGE OR WHAT???
[4:36:57] <rawrmeowxd> YEAAAAAA

[4:37:53] <ragasquid> I'm late. does he like it
[4:38:00] <alegut88> are you able to target the guys on the boat at all?
[4:38:05] <penitentpendant> There was an alternate route onto the boat from the other side, no?
[4:38:07] <%mikessdd> looks like they really want you to mess up by engaging the 3 off boat and waking up the guys on boat, for fail anyway
[4:38:13] <LorcaNomad> bodin has 2 armor monkaS
[4:38:13] <%Burdenslo> @penitentpendant I get their anger but it’s misdirected, they need to be more chill

[4:40:10] <%Broand> It's ghoul Jim!
[4:40:19] <penitentpendant> It's nice you have 'infinite time' to strategize for stealth
[4:40:34] <+king_of_beggars> The pigman's oinks are just nature sounds in this world. AHHH, THE GENTLE OINKS OF THE COUNTRYSIDE

[4:42:36] <penitentpendant> They're off sync atm

[4:58:01] <penitentpendant> He's not immune to stun though
[4:58:01] <%bevyrage> just alpha strike the pyro from range and force the guy to move into your range
[4:58:04] <%Alazull> Seems like a boss level encounter
[4:58:05] <penitentpendant> I hope
[4:58:07] <RaidenRising> BEGONE
[4:58:12] <%bevyrage> put her up on high cover so she can nail 'em with the rail

[4:58:55] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt it destroys cover as well
[4:59:00] <penitentpendant> Stunlock Bodin with your Baconator?
[4:59:02] <%BoxNavy> pat stares at the load game screen

[4:59:59] <%BoxNavy> i would do the same
[4:59:59] <rawrmeowxd> big mad
[5:00:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Dakuu75 I do the same thing when I play XCOM, who am I to judge
[5:00:02] <%Alazull> @Dakuu75 I ain't saying shit because it's how I play as well
[5:00:03] <rawrmeowxd> not pog

[5:02:23] <segychan> does overwatch mean no move but shoot ok?
[5:02:34] <%Dakuu75> would that be considered an "easy mode" thing or a "quality of life" thing?

[5:09:02] <%XzileGaming> get a haircut, you hippie
[5:09:06] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[5:09:07] <penitentpendant> Save Scumm before chosing
[5:09:12] <%Zetheos> pick both
[5:09:13] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Humanoid cows would have their nipples around their crotch because that's where their udders are
[5:09:14] <%BoxNavy> this is the toughest its ever been monkaS
[5:09:17] <TwoStarPlayersNik> yeah you want both
[5:09:18] <%king_wragles> Robots are JUST becoming a problem for you @PatStaresAt
[5:09:19] <seth45er> Dux makes a great sniper
[5:09:21] <%JamesCorck> Number go big.
[5:09:23] <+loukemia83> Shutting down enemies is good, like hogrush
[5:09:26] <%Zetheos> Save and Try is always nice
[5:09:26] <heartlesshealer> PAt
[5:09:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> choose payg
[5:09:28] <gslayer14> take the thing you don't have a slot filled for
[5:09:30] <+creamandsugar> eh it's only one round, get that extra range
[5:09:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> CHOOSE
[5:09:32] <%bevyrage> @Zetheos can't have both active at the same time though
[5:09:34] <%JamesCorck> Go big number go big.
[5:09:37] <heartlesshealer> Stun medibots for 1 turn or longer range?
[5:09:41] <rawrmeowxd> du bist die grosses pogchamp
[5:09:46] <%Undenizen> situational great vs. permanent good
[5:09:48] <%bevyrage> extra range doesn't have a CD right?
[5:09:49] <%GalacticaPhanto> wait how long has Pat been streaming?
[5:09:51] <%xain234> weapon raaange
[5:09:51] <rawrmeowxd> Ja
[5:09:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Eagle Eye first? You haven't encountered tons of mech enemies yet
[5:09:54] <+GrooovinMagic> Wrong choice!
[5:09:54] <TwoStarPlayersNik> here's the thing though, all of dux's passives are broken
[5:10:02] <TwoStarPlayersNik> the extra range is arguably the worst one
[5:10:04] <%BoxNavy> either one seems good
[5:10:06] <RyuuAoi> WRONG
[5:10:12] <penitentpendant> Save in a new slot~
[5:10:13] <+loukemia83> PLAYTHRUOGH RUINED
[5:10:15] <%Zetheos> @bevyrage u dont own me i do wat i want
[5:10:19] <donkymagooterson> does that overlap with another skill?
[5:10:21] <%XzileGaming> psaWrong
[5:10:22] <rawrmeowxd> NOT POG
[5:10:25] <%JeanGardner99> playthrough ruined
[5:10:26] <Dr_Mooose> goblins go!
[5:10:26] <%BoxNavy> YOU JUST GOT THE BAD END NotLikeThis
[5:10:26] <TwoStarPlayersNik> it's the right choice
[5:10:27] <%xain234> why is weapon range worse
[5:10:29] <rawrmeowxd> Nah you're probably good Pat
[5:10:31] <Gorgs7> because you're always wrong pat
[5:10:32] <%xain234> mech one is super situational
[5:10:32] <DrStinkers> soft locked :(
[5:10:33] <TwoStarPlayersNik> you need a way to disable robots
[5:10:34] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt it feels wrong in our hearts
[5:10:34] <%Puhff> WE KNOW ALL
[5:10:35] <caja_de_ojos> it's ALWAYS the wrong chois
[5:10:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> WRONG
[5:10:36] <rawrmeowxd> Listen to your gamer instinct
[5:10:38] <LorcaNomad> it's fine
[5:10:43] <TwoStarPlayersNik> I beat the game, circuit breaker is the right choice
[5:10:43] <%SirGO0SE> psaGoblin 's on parade
[5:10:44] <RyuuAoi> Bad end
[5:10:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> WE DO
[5:10:47] <TheBeanBox> Are you really gunna change your mind tho?
[5:10:48] <%BoxNavy> pat either skill is good you can just get the other one later
[5:10:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Just get both eventually
[5:10:54] <heartlesshealer> he can stun heal bots and then kill them to bring up that kill cooldown
[5:10:54] <rawrmeowxd> Oh this is pretty!!!
[5:10:56] <%Burdenslo> Robuts will be a problem and ya know it
[5:10:56] <%TIME_PUNCHER> believe in the heart of the saves
[5:10:58] <%xain234> you fight enough mechs to justify it?
[5:11:09] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Pretty
[5:11:16] <rawrmeowxd> Ich liebe dich pogchamp!
[5:11:16] <%king_wragles> To be fair, range hasn't been much of an issue yet. Robots have caused minor problems, so either is a good choice imo
[5:11:26] <RyuuAoi> I hope he save scummed before he chose.
[5:11:50] <%Dakuu75> So apparently Pat's dog has sleep apnea, just like him.
[5:11:57] <TheBeanBox> Is Zangeif snoring???
[5:12:08] <rawrmeowxd> bist du poggers?
[5:12:21] <heartlesshealer> he baby
[5:12:21] <PraiseHemra> Is this Wasteland?
[5:12:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Dogs with short snouts tend to be loud snorers
[5:12:27] <%BoxNavy> paiges mic isnt even on and we can hear him loud and clear
[5:12:32] <sonofthedeepsouth> MORE SNORE
[5:12:40] <%Alazull> I wish this was Wastleland
[5:13:05] <%Zetheos> X-COM: STALKER?
[5:13:07] <seth45er> the TTRPG is like 30 years old
[5:13:27] <RyuuAoi> Cyperpunk
[5:13:28] <donkymagooterson> wow really? I was just wondering about that
[5:13:47] <rawrmeowxd> I'm too young to understand the inspiration ig lol
[5:14:16] <%AzureGale> That WAS fun
[5:14:16] <seth45er> the new edition Its a great TTRPG
[5:14:17] <TheBeanBox> Is it inspired by TMNT???
[5:14:20] <%barrakuta371> I enjoyed that shit
