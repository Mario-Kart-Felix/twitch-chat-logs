[0:17:36] <$Chatterbox1991> mrdestructoid500 My understanding is that each of DMCs principal characters embodie a type of cool/chic; Dante being the rocker, Nero the Punk, V the Goth, Trish the Biker, Vergil the weeb, ect. Seeing as Nero is partly an amalgum of Vergil's pesonality, If Dante were to have a daughter (with Lucia for example) would it not be natural for an amalgam of Dante and Lucia's personality to be the DMC equivalent of an insufferable millenial Hipster? PS Capcom please make a DMC0 game about Sparda.

[0:44:29] <person181> much like V poe never had sex
[0:44:30] <%BisoromiBear> So it is written
[0:44:30] <NumberTooBig> @axelcezar for 6 months, in all honesty the Colonial marines amount of bugs may be fixed by then

[0:44:35] <%PlainSimpleTailor> How do you not fuck your waifu
[0:44:36] <%AncelDeLambert> Patton Oswalt's bit on Poe is so good
[0:44:36] <lloyddboy> Edgar Allan HOE

[0:44:37] <+RainShott> When does Pat usually play the game
[0:44:39] <%laserbeaming> Cap
[0:44:39] <SchroedingersFerret> He said the thing

[0:45:05] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat you're not specifying which podcast....
[0:45:06] <Parapattern> Everyone dies in an emotional gutter one way or another
[0:45:07] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat which time?
[0:45:07] <pectusumbra> we do know. He got drinks forced on him by a local election and he was the type that got hyper drunk super easily which is why he died in a ditch after getting a drunk vote out of him
[0:45:08] <shaneok64> Was there a time when you weren't doing that?
[0:45:10] <%Toynota10> Yeah I know that!

[0:45:20] <%mostundesired> LUL
[0:45:21] <%TeraMercier> But that means you have to add something on and create more content, not ramble like an idiot
[0:45:21] <aimlesshealer> But it IS a cat

[0:53:22] <Heissstt> @t_sasquatch keeping in rhythm dictates your coin multiplier
[0:53:22] <helpmeimafruit> So what Zelda song are you looking forward to the most in this style of gameplay? Is it Groose's theme?
[0:53:30] <%Jetsfantasy> @Hammerknife You have to, or suffer a score penalty. There's a character called the Bard that allows you to move when you want
