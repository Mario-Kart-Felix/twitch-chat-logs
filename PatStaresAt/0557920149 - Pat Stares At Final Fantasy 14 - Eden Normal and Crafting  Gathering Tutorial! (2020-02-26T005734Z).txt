[0:24:43] <bashful_bard> 15 is fine to do firmament
[0:24:43] <%ElenaManetta> All that happy passion Pat has when talking about FF14 makes me think he'd be a hit if he was just a 100% FF14 tutorial guy with tons of YT videos on specifics

[0:25:09] <+ThatGuyCalledJeff> You said in a podcast that having macros for combat was a bad idea due to lag/delay, what makes it different for crafting?

[0:25:39] <@mothmandraws> PLD is a nice tank
[0:25:47] <%isolex_> DRG?
[0:25:47] <%tizz86> honestly, i gift subs to keep this shit going. I've been following the Ziabatsu from the start. Over the years I've seen a bit of myself in all of them. But over the last 5yrs, I can relate the most to Pat
[0:25:49] <+Shockrates20XX> PLD is better than DRK though.
[0:25:51] <%Tucker0603> PLD best
[0:25:51] <%isolex_> oh yeah
[0:25:54] <@mothmandraws> drg is great but rough start
[0:25:54] <+Shockrates20XX> And looks cooler.
[0:25:57] <%king_wragles> LANCER LEADS TO BEST CLASS
[0:25:59] <IminyourBase> WAR best tanks
[0:26:01] <%WhereIsWill> DRK forever!
[0:26:02] <Man_in_the_Red> playing Tank early is good so you can cleanly transfer to DPS
[0:26:02] <+andrewoid_> i like how unga bunga WAR is
[0:26:02] <%Kiiper> DRk is WAY cooler
[0:26:04] <%isolex_> How so moth, i started DRG

[0:27:30] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> This is good to know.
[0:27:33] <icosahedralAPOI> Is the best way to level gatherer's levequests?
[0:27:38] <%spiritofmojave> Botany think makes more mons, plus weaving is easier with it fully leveled
[0:27:38] <+Taglog7> Time 2 craft and chill
[0:27:39] <+textandnumbers> i don't agree at all lol. i got my crafters up first just through dailies

[0:36:57] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Go go go!
[0:36:57] <PunishedMercer_> purple monster
[0:37:04] <%ShichiNoBushi> You like plunging? Are you a plunger?
[0:37:07] <KitsuneManami> @PatStaresAt I one shot this with full Pug
[0:37:08] <Ciglossonjr> Ik but I immediately thought of parces too
[0:37:09] <+xGreenflame> Cliffs are the Wol's only true weakness

[0:37:38] <Monkeyweed21> so you're not good enough
[0:37:39] <+Deosier> I know that feeling
[0:37:42] <%ElenaManetta> this is your time committment
[0:37:43] <+killfrost11> god same my dude
[0:37:45] <%NopeBadguy> PEOPLE WOULD TOTALLY WATCH SAVAGE
[0:37:54] <KitsuneManami> @PatStaresAt But you can just STREAM it for "Work"
[0:37:57] <%isolex_> PEOPLE WOULD TOTALLY WATCH YOU RUN SAVAGE
[0:37:58] <Monkeyweed21> people totally stream savage
[0:37:59] <+Newtling> MMOs aren't made for people with jobs, especially not the raid portions
[0:38:01] <General_Terro> coward

[0:38:06] <%ElenaManetta> why don't you just stream 10 hours like woolie
[0:38:07] <Fujiwara_92> if you can't do savage, you lost twice @angriestpat
[0:38:07] <%QuadraticGravity> it really doesn't take long once you give it a couple weeks for people to get fights down. You can reclear with one raid night per week and like two hours
[0:38:11] <T_Sasquatch> rebb ford onlyafroLove
[0:38:13] <%Eaglestrike117> "Work at night" he says

[0:38:17] <TioXyco> Why not try savage with viewers?
[0:38:19] <+SlumberMan> Doing Savage is exhausting. Seeing my friends prog for 4 hours every other night even exhausts me.
[0:38:21] <%Rngiddion> savage is not a chat interactive stream lol
[0:38:24] <amused_platypus> cog has been waiting a rez so long
[0:38:25] <xeros720> FF14 is probably the closest you'd get to actually raiding on a decent schedule
[0:38:25] <NJigglypuff> what is the general time commitment for a single savage raid?

[0:39:12] <Xelhesia> savage is already hard as is. splitting brain power and attention span is just too much

[1:02:07] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @twoto858 Through Square. Weird issues can occure through Steam, such as updates not happening properly or at the right time.
[1:02:08] <%ExpressNode> You play it PC with your Dualshock 4. Wouldn't it be better just to play on a PS4?
[1:02:09] <+Foontitz> @C24U they are going to do a number squish next expac

[1:02:46] <C24U> @Foontitz I just remember 1K HP was considered a lot and doing 700 damage with Thunder 4 was considered end game type damage

[1:03:58] <Monkeyweed21> You died too cumbo
[1:03:59] <%ExpressNode> The Cog in the machine
[1:04:00] <IndoorSitup> FFXIV has a distinct lack of FFIX fanservice, IMO. It's THE best FF after all.
[1:04:01] <Fujiwara_92> SOME BIG WIPEOUTS
[1:04:01] <%NWR_James> REKT

[1:04:15] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> WOW the callouts
[1:04:16] <%king_wragles> Tank died twice, DPS can't help with a dead tank
[1:04:17] <deadbeat34> First wipe of the night
[1:04:19] <Beefchief33> Try is the keyword
[1:04:29] <+D00msDayDan> he hit a wave and it fucked up his rotation

[1:04:30] <%goose_attack_almanac> I'M ADDING THIS RAID TO THE ALMANAC
[1:04:36] <IndoorSitup> This game has a distinct lack of FFIX fanservice, IMO. It's THE best FF after all.
[1:04:37] <Xelhesia> hurts like shit too sometimes
[1:04:37] <ha2ken> So you become Krauser?
[1:04:38] <+xGreenflame> Wait that's a DPS check?
[1:04:40] <maebold> Legally you can blame Cog because of their stanky houseboat internet or something
[1:04:40] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Noodling is fuckin lethal
[1:04:41] <%nofestu2> catfish gotta get the dick
[1:04:42] <%sshen> Minus 50 DKP

[1:04:47] <NemokillerV> Incoming Japes
[1:04:48] <%VashyronM> Why are you fucking fish?
[1:04:48] <@Velyndra> what is a cooldown
[1:04:49] <C24U> @Foontitz and melee classes had no freaking place in endgame because 1 damage = 10TP to HNMs making them kill you super fast
[1:04:49] <Slimeking_Mike> pat
[1:04:50] <neVan0> OK!
[1:04:51] <Kain5707> inochiThonk
[1:04:52] <%mMayrro> PAT NO THIS ISNT BESTARS
[1:04:53] <RossMirage> The last tier of the previous raid ALMOST was FF9 themed, but tey saved it for another time.
[1:04:55] <Visorak6> Arent catfish full of spines
[1:04:56] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt please stop trying to fuck people's dinner
[1:04:58] <%ShichiNoBushi> "I will procede to pleasure myself with this fish."
[1:04:59] <%TheWinged7> to quote that one anime "Now i will pleasure myself with this fish"
[1:04:59] <%NWR_James> I have caught a catfish with my hands. They are strong as hell
[1:05:00] <%TomDanksEGOT> good ol hand fishin
[1:05:03] <KoyaMusa> leave the namazu alone, pat

[1:05:54] <xeros720> preemptive shame stacking
[1:05:58] <SilverRoddo> Use your Gundam Seed Coordinator skills
[1:05:59] <xeros720> it's high level raiding technique
[1:06:02] <GroundAwesome> @QuadraticGravity @ArcanumMBD but I like Bio+Miasma and don't like Summoner or baby Ifrit
[1:06:05] <%spiritofmojave> @omegaweltall hey you take that back my gecko man is super worth it
[1:06:05] <+joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> SOLUTION IS TO STOP PLAYING SHITTY GAMES

[1:06:50] <+pandamancer224> @pandamancer224 is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[1:06:51] <%QuadraticGravity> @GroundAwesome Summoner can turn their ifrit into a carbuncle and keeps bio + miasma
[1:06:53] <%WanderingSwordsman> looking good so far
[1:07:00] <Slimeking_Mike> Bluewu
[1:07:02] <eagerhexarch> Can you yeet yourself off the stage with that
[1:07:08] <%QuadraticGravity> @eagerhexarch yes :)
[1:07:09] <%ArcanumMBD> @GroundAwesome you are missing over 2/3rds of your skill if you don't use your job. If you want double DoTs then play SMN. You can change your summons appearance after doing a quest
[1:07:09] <WoodenTarkus> Yes
[1:07:11] <bashful_bard> Absolutely
[1:07:11] <Jolnir> the rescues LUL
[1:07:11] <%BlitzNeidhart> @eagerhexarch Yes
[1:07:12] <eagerhexarch> Beautiful.
[1:07:20] <HibikiYamada> @eagerhexarch sure can. it's some looneytunes shit lol
[1:07:23] <%NWR_James> Who's here for a Pat self-yeet
[1:07:34] <%ArcanumMBD> @GroundAwesome so you can make Ifrit look like Garuda, or Titan, or a Ruby/Emerald/Topaz Carbuncle
[1:07:40] <Kahpoe_Lelou> if any healer is listening. a big brain rescue would be to move them before the teleport to the edge. BrokeBack
[1:07:44] <%BlitzNeidhart> Pat will yeet himself of the stage LUL
[1:07:46] <andrei11dr> So ,will he do the Ruby fight tonight?
[1:07:49] <SilverRoddo> I’m here for the mirror trick
[1:08:01] <Saltmeisterr> hello
[1:08:04] <%WhereIsWill> we'll never forget how you started that nier raid pat you can't escape
[1:08:09] <Daxalog> I just realized your swinging at nothing
[1:08:13] <$RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt What's your opinion on FF13 soundtrack?
[1:08:16] <Saltmeisterr> is this soodoobringers?
[1:08:22] <%ssjklyco> You're just flying through this bird fight
[1:08:26] <WoodenTarkus> Shadaloobringers
[1:08:27] <GroundAwesome> @ArcanumMBD do you know if the mission is in ARR or do I need the expansions?
[1:08:27] <%xxshadowxx416> this look so boring this raid in mmo I thought destiny was bad
[1:08:30] <%Shadicara> Just defeat the bird ball now LUL
[1:08:35] <%TomDanksEGOT> isnt it the same since you have to get hit by a specific color?
[1:08:37] <%VashyronM> watch them wipe again
[1:08:39] <Xelhesia> just like ff8
[1:08:39] <$Thatghostpepper> @RetroCop87 now you made me sad again
[1:08:43] <bashful_bard> Totally agree
[1:08:44] <%king_wragles> FF13 was a game?
[1:08:46] <andrei11dr> Just like 8
[1:08:47] <%Swampykins> I agree
[1:08:52] <%spiritofmojave> Truth, 8 had the same thing
[1:08:53] <%WhereIsWill> facts
[1:08:55] <%ShichiNoBushi> I like the battle music, "Blinded by Light".
[1:08:58] <%TheWinged7> psaBig psaWrong dressing up your potato is
[1:08:59] <SilverRoddo> ShadowHedgehoggers
[1:09:00] <C24U> I think the summon designs were pretty cool
[1:09:00] <KoyaMusa> blinded by light is good, then there's the rest of the game
[1:09:01] <Louie_Salmon> Well that isn't saying much
[1:09:01] <%Muzzle131> and now it's got nier music! X100 Now
[1:09:04] <Mexrage> i don't hate FF13, but i still agree is the best part of it
[1:09:05] <%ChaosAethr> 13 OST was awesome
[1:09:06] <%vectorless_peon> true
[1:09:13] <%NopeBadguy> i apologize if you're rowdy, i am somewhat drunk
[1:09:18] <%NopeBadguy> if I'M rowdy
[1:09:19] <transporterthesequel> The most dangerous boss, BIRBS
[1:09:19] <%NopeBadguy> FUCK
[1:09:22] <IndoorSitup> This game has a distinct lack of FFIX fanservice, like music remixes. It's THE best FF after all.
[1:09:23] <%Shadicara> Just the battles themselves are very ass Kappa
[1:09:29] <bestwaifuritsu> What do you think about them changing the dungeon shb theme to the rock guitar Primals version?
[1:09:33] <%ArcanumMBD> @GroundAwesome it's in the base game. Once you get your Summoner to level 50 and do the job quest, it will be available at the Arcanist guild in Limsa
[1:09:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> I still ocassionally look up the Shadowbringers main theme
[1:09:39] <bashful_bard> Those birds are very dangerous
[1:09:52] <andrei11dr> Honorable mentions to the FFX soundtrack, that Semor theme Kreygasm
[1:09:59] <%Shadicara> This is just watching a million birds try to shit on your head all at once LUL
[1:10:00] <%ArcanumMBD> @GroundAwesome The quest is called "An Egi By Any Other Name"
[1:10:01] <+Yakobro> brain strats
[1:10:02] <%MegboyManuel> its literally just a flock of geese
[1:10:04] <DarknessD42> I’m still waiting for The man with the Machine gun to kick in
[1:10:07] <%averyoddjew> so apparently warframe made it into smash with a lotus spirit
[1:10:10] <Xelhesia> these look like the skyfish from Eureka Seven

[1:57:56] <Visorak6> set the level to however high you are above it
[1:57:56] <Ultimatefool> ONLY 20 MINUTES
[1:57:57] <%ImmaCanuck> sfoxLOL

[1:58:02] <%NWR_James> BIG STRUMBO
[1:58:06] <$Trenr> always fucking max them out what the hell
[1:58:09] <%cureneckbeard> psaWrong
[1:58:10] <%Verd_254> don't do that, you will fail if you're under geared
[1:58:11] <Basch71> always max
[1:58:12] <$Trenr> why would you not
[1:58:13] <%realm_forge> Ore Else....
[1:58:16] <@mothmandraws> also grab a bunch of cordials for this
[1:58:17] <Visorak6> you'll be undergeared
[1:58:19] <%GarbageNirvana> Doin a bang up job so far with this tutorial m8
[1:58:19] <KeiPrime> but number big
[1:58:21] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> ALWAYS MAX if you are already at that level or higher
[1:58:22] <@mothmandraws> get them from gc hand ins
[1:58:24] <%spiritofmojave> how will he ever do this leve with his level 80 mining gear
[1:58:25] <Basch71> its legit free exp
[1:58:33] <$Trenr> just use the big gather skill and get them easy
[1:58:34] <%xxshadowxx416> so is this the salt mine
[1:58:36] <%Binary_Fireball> man im in a shit mood, quick someone say something dumb so I can verbally harass them to make myself feel better for just a couple of seconds.
[1:58:37] <%GarbageQueenEllie> We're reaching unprecedented levels of miner exploitation
[1:58:37] <%LaughingCatt> Set difficulty to the highest you can do reliably do
[1:58:41] <$Trenr> this is what cordials are made for
[1:58:42] <DetroitSentai> Always max no matter what, DoL leves arent hard even low geared
[1:58:44] <KeiPrime> they cap at 100
[1:58:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> levvie you bastard
[1:58:48] <KeiPrime> just use em
[1:58:57] <%marsantas> Work on getting that honest gilonaire title!
[1:59:00] <%StrawberryPantsu> Yeah
[1:59:04] <%Binary_Fireball> damn
[1:59:07] <%StrawberryPantsu> I always have 100
[1:59:15] <%DensityD> psaCaw Honk!..........no wait
[1:59:16] <@mothmandraws> also pro tip, you get challenge log for doing x amount of leves, if you want to level your main jobs, do 4 leves as gatherer then a piss easy fighting leve on job you want xp on
[1:59:17] <%Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Pat, you're gonna wanna retract that, 1-50 gatherers, they have a 50% of failing if you go +4, always do +1 over the recommend

[2:04:26] <%umbypokochan> the timers are in the game now tho
[2:04:30] <%Verd_254> can you not use the find gathering source option?
[2:04:55] <%realm_forge> Horse porn in 3...2..1...
[2:04:56] <thelonechris> This feels like an infomercial

[2:05:08] <+budyd> but wait
[2:05:09] <RadShiro> he thought it had a timer LUL
[2:05:11] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Ehhh, I dunno, selling crack to cat people sounds easier.

[2:05:13] <%NWR_James> Garland Tools is the Slapchop of FFXIV Websites

[2:05:18] <Louie_Salmon> Holy crap this UI, so many people must use this
[2:05:20] <%DensityD> pat show something that actually makes use of Garland Tools
[2:05:24] <IndoorSitup> Careful not to accidentaly open your gay old man porn tab
[2:05:25] <cherrycottontail> The collectible people still tell me they don't want to talk to me and I never figured out how to get them to do that

[2:07:33] <+DontMindMee> ffxivteamcraft is amazing
[2:07:34] <Visorak6> making money is a job
[2:07:34] <PkSilent01> It was reveled with KH 1.5+2.8 and 2.8 so there’s hope @indoorsitup
[2:07:35] <haisho> becasue it is
[2:07:37] <cherrycottontail> YEs, these are literally jobs
[2:07:44] <Xelhesia> cuz it kinda is.
[2:07:58] <Louie_Salmon> An MMO is a job you pay for
[2:08:01] <%dekkitout> "Tome of Geological Lore" sounds like a book that'd soak all the panties~

[2:08:29] <$Thatghostpepper> @SSaryn it is coming to xbox
[2:08:30] <+DontMindMee> that unlocks the GOOD SHIT

[2:09:59] <darkmoonsorceress> aeroPray
[2:10:00] <%republicofu> do you need to get the old folklore books from the past expansions?
[2:10:00] <Visorak6> time for custom macros

[2:10:59] <haisho> ah yes BIG NUMBER times
[2:11:00] <+DontMindMee> right but I don't think you get that at 50

[2:11:57] <suikudo> i just unlocked that
[2:12:04] <suikudo> this is all super good info
[2:12:09] <%Ifitsleeps> Christ

[2:12:19] <haisho> Pray return to the Waking Sands
[2:12:20] <HiggsV> My head hurty
[2:12:23] <+GaiaGreen> What was that early rotation?
[2:12:25] <KeiPrime> it makes more sense once you got well into it
[2:12:26] <Visorak6> It takes a few runs to internalize it all dont worry about it
[2:12:32] <%Tenkay> "Patron, please return to the Waking Sands"
[2:12:34] <+2DSuperiority> zoneRaid macro time
[2:12:37] <RadShiro> OH NO MACROS. ME BRAIN
[2:12:38] <BoneBagMel> I wonder if pat likes games like factorio
[2:12:41] <Zeldrick> @KoyaMusa I have only gatherers at 50, crafters at 60-ish, I get the idea.
[2:12:41] <ha2ken> I'm an outsider to the game but it's still entertaining as other MMOs have relaged content
[2:12:56] <KitsuneManami> @PatStaresAt How was your Eden 8? I had people keep staring at Shiva during the Blind
[2:12:58] <%crimsonharvest> this is absolutely case sensitive right
[2:13:10] <%DjFrostBite95> Just did rooSpy
[2:13:10] <@mothmandraws> the e8 run was full group
[2:13:12] <@mothmandraws> so no issues
[2:13:19] <@mothmandraws> e7 was big meme tho
[2:13:29] <+RoxyRhapsody> Oooh nice

[2:13:56] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I don't understand macros
[2:13:56] <RadShiro> can I copy and paste that shit, or do I have to put it all in manually?
[2:13:58] <kiso52> omg this is fucking gibberish for me lol
[2:13:58] <suikudo> pull it back up for a second
[2:13:59] <dickbuttwoman> Knowing the rotation and why it works also helps, fwi

[2:15:24] <+DontMindMee> There is some optimization in regards to how many times it procs

[2:59:12] <%YakumoYomi> LEGOSI SENPAI

[2:59:15] <xeros720> it's a complicated feeling
[2:59:16] <Anr1ck> shouldnt you use GP to get more rocks?
[2:59:17] <%shurtal> So, thirsty Zootopia
[2:59:21] <%PanicSwytch> FURRIES NEED TO FUCK
[2:59:21] <%dekkitout> I thought it was mutual wanting of the fucking?
[2:59:21] <%tusk102> LEGOSI IS THE BEST
[2:59:22] <Wigglebottom_> LuvPeekR hello all
[2:59:22] <FalseEyeD> And the Rabbit sleeps around
[2:59:22] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> better zootopia
[2:59:23] <Kain5707> @PatStaresAt what about just leveling CUL?
[2:59:24] <+CounterBeard> shit gets wild in beastars
[2:59:27] <+RenoDeGeneric> Beastars is super dark
[2:59:27] <sadboixx420xx> ... maybe
[2:59:30] <Xelhesia> Zootopia got nothing on Beastars
[2:59:31] <DeliciousPears> Grimdark Zootopia
[2:59:32] <xeros720> oh man, you should read the manga
[2:59:34] <%cureneckbeard> better zootopia, or worse interspecies reviewers
[2:59:34] <RubberFistFight> @MayorRev yeah people who say that are typically FIRST to plug their own shit. Fucken hypocrites.
[2:59:37] <%tusk102> Beastars is super dark
[2:59:42] <+DesertPenguin> beastars
[2:59:43] <xeros720> apparently carnivores lowkey rip arms off of people
[2:59:43] <%goose_attack_almanac> It wasn't about Arby's. It was about interspecies sexual fantasies.
[2:59:44] <+DesertPenguin> hentai
[2:59:45] <$nicks220> beastars is more than that Pat
[2:59:47] <%SirGO0SE> i need to take the dive on beastars
[2:59:47] <xeros720> it's a known problem
[2:59:48] <ha2ken> Should he eat...or should he eat?
[2:59:52] <Frostydough1> imagine telling a content creator to not plug their own content on THEIR channel LUL
[2:59:53] <GingerSen> CUL is expensive on mats as well
[2:59:57] <+DesertPenguin> Is the rabbit's name Peter?
[2:59:58] <Visorak6> and those raid pots
[3:00:00] <KoyaMusa> crafting food pat
[3:00:00] <GingerSen> same for ALC
[3:00:10] <%ssjklyco> If you listen to the beginning of the first SBFC all the way to the recent CSB, do you become god tier in FFXIV?
[3:00:12] <%LaughingCatt> Every Culinarian recipe needs a bunch of food mats thats why
[3:00:12] <+DesertPenguin> GUys, listen to this week's podcast
[3:00:15] <+HelloImTom08> CUL is nitche and annoying as fuck
[3:00:21] <sadboixx420xx> Leave me alone @Frostydough1 !!!!!!!!!!!
[3:00:24] <bestwaifuritsu> The virgin Legosi vs the chad Louis.
[3:00:26] <Monkeyweed21> plus herbs and salt
[3:00:28] <%tusk102> @nicks220 he talked more about it on the podcast. also he's only watched the anime and thus doesn't have the big manga stuff
[3:00:31] <%crimsonharvest> Culinarian doesn't really use much in the way of intermediate crafting mats right, its mostly raw food and stuff
[3:00:33] <%xxshadowxx416> destiny 2 premiere of next season in 4 min
[3:00:34] <+HelloImTom08> unless your makin raid food dont bother with CUL
[3:00:36] <%MaddyCaddy> Fishing is stupid easy to level now though.
[3:00:38] <%Dapper_Cactuar> leatherworking also requires you to hunt quite a bit
[3:00:39] <%Ilpala> yo Beastars is super good and that manga fucking BLINDSIDED me when they went to the Back Alley Market. There aint no "blood mist" seeping from that guy in the manga YOU SEE EVERYTHING
[3:00:43] <GingerSen> I love how CUL also has all its food have tasty descriptions in them
[3:00:43] <Kain5707> i have all 3 gathers over 60
[3:00:44] <KoyaMusa> you basically need everything
[3:00:46] <%chronoxgp> it is incremental obviously with the learning
[3:00:53] <athanasthegreat> You need miner for the water and salt
[3:00:55] <Finaldragoon> you need miner for stuff like rock salt
[3:00:58] <+MisterRockett> You get salt from miners.
[3:01:03] <Fathuran> So culinarian is good if you enjoy gathering and don't want to rely on mats from other crafters then? That sounds awesome, never thought to try it yet.
[3:01:07] <%Verd_254> you need miner, there's rock salts and spring water
[3:01:25] <VidulaSaix> Nah, new glamours far outprice crafting gear
[3:01:26] <%ssjklyco> So become every job
[3:01:30] <VidulaSaix> People are crazy for that shit
[3:01:33] <+HelloImTom08> thats me :D
[3:01:34] <RubberFistFight> @Frostydough1 there are so many "communities" for streamers/LPers/Podcasters who refuse to let you plug your content. It's fucking absurd. Visibility is easily the biggest hurdle to overcome for anybody making shit online (christ, I've struggled with it for 2 years). You can't rely on anyone else to advertise your shit for you.
[3:01:35] <%MaddyCaddy> Market Goblins
[3:01:36] <%SirGO0SE> psaBougie
[3:01:38] <+KeslGames> You should make this an ASMR stream
[3:01:38] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @PatStaresAt Can I pay to win?
[3:01:38] <dickbuttwoman> Holla
[3:01:41] <%WhereIsWill> psaBougie psaBougie psaBougie
[3:01:42] <frozenottsel> Can we eat them?
[3:01:43] <%tusk102> psaBougie psaBougie psaBougie

[3:01:59] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> I just want the cool rebel coat :(
[3:02:00] <%Alpha8087> LOL yeah like the HQ Neo Ishgardian battle gear is like 300k or so, HQ crafter high end, SUPERCASH
[3:02:02] <%crimsonharvest> As far as pay to win goes YES, you can pay raids to carry your useless ass
[3:02:04] <%XeroSigmaPrime> FUYCK
[3:02:04] <Visorak6> there would be riots for crafting job potions
[3:02:04] <%2DSuperiority> Buy Retainers for more Gil
[3:02:06] <%RavenHellkite> the bed mount still more expensive than all crafting gear LUL
[3:02:07] <Veluren> It's not super hard to become an omnicrafter thanks to firmament being such a good boost, but being an omnicrafter who can make HQ gear without pots is a different beast
[3:02:08] <%dekkitout> Are jump potions technically 'winning'?
[3:02:08] <%spiritofmojave> Retainer levels can technically be one
[3:02:08] <%ssjklyco> You don't learn anything
[3:02:08] <%Rumbutt> psaBougie
[3:02:10] <%chronoxgp> yeah but hand gliders tho
[3:02:12] <yourliteraldog> One hellscape of an economy.
[3:02:14] <haisho> GET WORKING FOR THAT COAT
[3:02:14] <KoyaMusa> buy levekits
[3:02:15] <@mothmandraws> rebel coats comes from maps
[3:02:18] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Never played the game, but this is fascinating stuff.
[3:02:22] <@mothmandraws> maps is the peasants way of earning money
[3:02:24] <%TheWinged7> however you can pay some chinese kid to come play your account Kappa
[3:02:24] <+CounterBeard> are you riding robo from chrono trigger?
[3:02:25] <+HelloImTom08> just buy the matts and make some crafting friends
[3:02:29] <%tusk102> @ssjklyco insert that "you didn't improve, you cheated yourself" game tweet
[3:02:30] <+HelloImTom08> ask ppl in your FC
[3:02:36] <%Alpha8087> Man I hoard everything from maps
[3:02:59] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> monkaS
[3:03:07] <+HelloImTom08> sofieOof
[3:03:09] <%chronoxgp> @CounterBeard 3C3C1D119440927 from Nier
[3:03:18] <+whitemage4life> I just bought a Vita. does anyone have advice to what cool stuff I can do with it
[3:03:23] <$RetroCop87> STOP SAYING MACROCRAFT, all I can think of is giant star fox humping the World Trade Center
[3:03:23] <%Verd_254> im a crazy person and i actually enjoy making HQ things manually
[3:03:24] <%moogleboy1984> I had that shit memorized
[3:03:25] <%DensityD> ResidentSleeper
[3:03:34] <%LaughingCatt> Heavensward crafting fucking suuuuuuuuuuuucked
[3:03:35] <haisho> oh no
[3:03:36] <Veluren> Also @PatStaresAt to give you an idea of the gap between just gathering stuff to crafting stuff. The leather for the new coat is selling for about 600k, the actual COAT that you need to be a crafter to make? 3-5 million minimum, easy
[3:03:36] <haisho> MATH
[3:03:38] <Visorak6> Im glad the devs moved away from that fuckawful garbage
[3:03:38] <%ssjklyco> @tusk102 for MMOs, it's probably essential to learn what you are playing. Otherwise you leveled to cap but your gear sucks
[3:03:42] <dickbuttwoman> I made so much cash
[3:03:43] <Veluren> Well, to give everyone else
[3:03:49] <KoyaMusa> god remember when they capped crafter progression with scrips holy shit
[3:03:50] <%2DSuperiority> @retrocop87 zoneSmug MACROeconomics
[3:03:51] <GingerSen> Sold weapons on 10 mil on Balmung during that time
[3:03:51] <RubberFistFight> @whitemage4life custom firmware, also play Persona 4 Golden because it's actually pretty good (outside of the shit-ass rigged battle RHG)
[3:04:02] <Monkeyweed21> what if I don't want to bother
[3:04:04] <GingerSen> the golden age
[3:04:10] <GingerSen> and it will never happen again..
[3:04:29] <yourliteraldog> @RetroCop87 I don't remember 9/11 like that
[3:04:29] <%SirGO0SE> make a quick butt
[3:04:34] <MayorRev> quick butt
[3:04:39] <%ssjklyco> Eh
[3:04:42] <MayorRev> Quick butt Dickbutt
[3:04:44] <haisho> imagine Pat trying to explain Heavensward crafting
[3:04:47] <GingerSen> oh yeah, crafting needed this rework
[3:04:49] <%SirGO0SE> BUY STONKS
[3:04:50] <kiso52> relative moron? WTF man im completely confused
[3:04:51] <%AnIcedCoffee> I speedlevelled my crafters and gatherers to 80 as soon as shadowbringers came out and made 100+ million in the first week, I think I'm done for awhile
[3:04:54] <frozenottsel> STONKS
[3:04:54] <kiso52> lol
[3:04:55] <+corrosivePaladin> Pat explains how to make a quick butt
[3:04:57] <%MaddyCaddy> My FC leader is so rich he can buy a large plot for himself and the FC. sipsipHellmo
[3:05:01] <+whitemage4life> @rubberfistfight I plan to. played original so replaying with new stuff seems cool
[3:05:06] <%cappyd33> trickle down economics
[3:05:16] <%MaddyCaddy> Craft = big number
[3:05:25] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> Jeez, I thought Guild Wars 2 crafting was a nightmare
[3:05:27] <Visorak6> unless you're selling them on patch day
[3:05:35] <Veluren> You can sell the derpy boi from Hydratos for 5 mil
[3:05:35] <%DensityD> his mount is cooler than yours
[3:05:37] <%ssjklyco> The farthest I got in 14 was I think level 15 pug, then got stuck on trying to level a cloth job.
[3:05:39] <%SirGO0SE> turn your life around with ff14
[3:05:40] <kiso52> @PatStaresAt human beings? you mean casual players?
[3:05:40] <arkv01> the fuck do crafters do with big cash after? buy real estate?
[3:05:40] <logoth_> I remember in FF11 money was absurdly hard to get
[3:05:41] <+HelloImTom08> its all about the patch day hustle
[3:05:41] <Monkeyweed21> Pat is a big fan of trickle down economics
[3:05:48] <+HelloImTom08> all the money is made on patch day
[3:05:50] <+projectmanatees> Will you show people maps? they're a good method for money as well
[3:06:00] <frozenottsel> I make money just by selling Phantasmagoria (and other tomestone) materials
[3:06:01] <%tusk102> psaBougie psaBougie psaBougie psaBougie
[3:06:09] <%king_wragles> Later chat

[3:06:15] <%DensityD> psaBougie psaBougie psaBougie psaBougie
[3:06:17] <+TheStarvingGood> Pat what do you spend your gil on???
[3:06:22] <Basch71> crafted weapons are absurdly expensive
[3:06:22] <%GarbageQueenEllie> ...These people have NO LIFE.
[3:06:22] <+lumporr> pawg
[3:06:24] <KoyaMusa> oh yeah i made 50mil during the first few hours
[3:06:29] <KoyaMusa> of 5.2
[3:06:29] <%spiritofmojave> What do you mean THESE people psaBougie
[3:06:34] <+MoonObscure> jesus fuck
[3:06:39] <GingerSen> the raids
[3:06:42] <%chhdez> "Your people"
[3:06:46] <Finaldragoon> pentamelding is one of the most insane things you can do in this game. it's the easiest way to drain your bank.
[3:06:50] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt hows does your character not drown? game logic or is there some dumb magic reason in game
[3:06:57] <%dekkitout> Any indication as to how they're able to guess the right mats?
[3:06:58] <@mothmandraws> also alot of raider have the money to burn
[3:07:03] <+RocketBarrel> Fuck crafting. I make money using maps. Easy Shell Leathers. HahaThink HahaThink
[3:07:05] <%chronoxgp> pay someone to level for you
[3:07:06] <%crimsonharvest> I sat on 40 million gil for 3 years and didnt have anything to actually do with it, its not worth obsessing
[3:07:09] <@mothmandraws> dekk tome stuff
[3:07:22] <@mothmandraws> every tier there is new tome mats
[3:07:23] <yourliteraldog> So when dose fun come into the equation for those people.
[3:07:24] <FalseEyeD> God Bless the Raiders
[3:07:26] <Xelhesia> yup
[3:07:32] <%tusk102> oh boy
[3:07:34] <Manwad> The number must rise
[3:07:36] <@mothmandraws> I sold full phanta tome for like 2 mill
[3:07:37] <xeros720> pi po
[3:07:51] <Visorak6> alternatively theres big money to be made when new EX primal craftable weapons come out like the samurai blades for original primals
[3:08:14] <%chronoxgp> yeah like does pat know minecraft is a thing?>
[3:08:17] <+HelloImTom08> yea daily routes are worth so much gil right now, ez million or 2
[3:08:19] <@mothmandraws> id recomend getting group of 4-5 for maps
[3:08:24] <%Ilpala> fuckin rare ass enchanted elm lumber
[3:08:24] <@mothmandraws> each buy 3 maps
[3:08:27] <%Ilpala> want my flying bed
[3:08:28] <@mothmandraws> for like 120k total
[3:08:29] <Visorak6> people want them weapon glams
[3:08:31] <Scrub_Lord> Man I loved FFXIV, I just got so tired of the same Game play loop every major patch/Expansion.
[3:08:34] <+HelloImTom08> usually do maps from my FC free for all
[3:08:36] <%ssjklyco> I only have base XIV. Should I just buy the recent expansion?
[3:08:41] <+projectmanatees> or gather the maps its free
[3:08:42] <@mothmandraws> just running you should get 300k each
[3:08:55] <@mothmandraws> owner of map gets to roll need
[3:08:59] <+wjones0415> @ssjklyco yes absolutely
[3:09:06] <sadboixx420xx> I wanna spank a tree
[3:09:06] <Ciglossonjr> @ssjklyco all the expansions are bought as one purchase
[3:09:18] <%DeltascapeV4> It's not Pat
[3:09:24] <%MaddyCaddy> I thought it came with HW?
[3:09:28] <Visorak6> sometimes they will do stuff like offer HW for free right
[3:09:33] <+Ell1ot> i think wow does that now
[3:09:36] <%dekkitout> Oh, so it's a model made by A SANE PERSON?!
[3:09:38] <@mothmandraws> nah there was a deal for free HW
[3:09:39] <%spiritofmojave> Mean that'a more conventional than WoW's model
[3:09:44] <%Dapper_Cactuar> there is also the complete edition which has everything
[3:09:44] <@mothmandraws> dunno if its still up
[3:09:44] <%tusk102> why is that weird? @PatStaresAt
[3:09:47] <%ssjklyco> That seems worth it.
[3:09:53] <+HelloImTom08> yea they did that weird HW for free thing, that was a one time thing tho
[3:10:02] <%Maids4lyfe> the free HW isn't available anymore, it was for last year
[3:10:08] <+wjones0415> that's not backwards, that's convenient
[3:10:10] <Visorak6> ah right
[3:10:11] <@mothmandraws> I think they should expand it to HW in base game now
[3:10:15] <%chronoxgp> you can tell the earth is curved if you set two different timers to go off at noon in different places
[3:10:17] <%spiritofmojave> HW for free just happened for ShB's release
[3:10:18] <%ssjklyco> Farthest I got was level 15, but I kinda want to try again.
[3:10:18] <sadboixx420xx> Yo, you ever look at the exhaust pipe of a car and think "Damn, I gotta shove my sausage in there"?
[3:10:29] <bestwaifuritsu> I wouldnt be surprised if WoW started doing that now, they seem pretty straightforward to try and be like 14 LUL
[3:10:30] <@mothmandraws> pat you seen the stuff about flying in arr
[3:10:35] <%hrudzie_1> @PatStaresAt is this the stream you bragged about on the podcast
[3:10:37] <@mothmandraws> they updated limsa model
[3:10:39] <%Dapper_Cactuar> that lead up to Titan was annoying as hell
[3:10:40] <+Deosier> they also might finally add flying
[3:10:41] <%RavenHellkite> and seems like they're adding flying to ARR areas
[3:10:42] <@mothmandraws> and flying boundries were added
[3:10:43] <%MaddyCaddy> How many less times will you have to go to the waking sands?
[3:10:45] <faldin> no more 20 quests for a dude in a shack asking for wine??? thank god
[3:10:48] <+HelloImTom08> base game is fucked with fetch quests
[3:10:49] <Visorak6> The awful stretch thats called after the fall is getting crunched down
[3:10:51] <%spiritofmojave> thank god
[3:10:54] <%DjFrostBite95> Thank god
[3:10:54] <+RocketBarrel> Post ARR was a nightmare
[3:10:55] <Xelhesia> thats great
[3:10:59] <Ciglossonjr> THE TITAN BANQUET STAYS FUCKERS
[3:11:06] <+HelloImTom08> i dont think you will fly, i think its just a consistancy thing with the barrier
[3:11:08] <@mothmandraws> no they make titan quests longer
[3:11:09] <%crimsonharvest> They should retcon linkpearls out of the game so it makes sense to keep going back there
[3:11:10] <%spiritofmojave> no more worrying about riding maps for ARR never touched
[3:11:11] <%DedlokPM> OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD ADD FLYING TO ARR AREAS
[3:11:13] <+ktothec99> I'm stuck right now at Ramuh (hard) cause it hard to find a party
[3:11:14] <+Deosier> make it longer
[3:11:14] <%MaddyCaddy> Gotta make that walk every time still.
[3:11:15] <GingerSen> did ya see the data mine of the stuff being in flying?
[3:11:23] <%SuperSilverPanda> SuperSilverPanda subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Woot woot, lets hope for more FFXIV chill streams

[3:11:25] <%ImmaCanuck> That's good because I'm still at lvl 33 in the ARR main story after playing since the start of the year. And my WAR is 56 already.
[3:11:25] <+Kyderz3> Does pat only play tanks?

[3:11:39] <Boxbunnytheliar> oh dang msq is how I get big exp when leveling stuff
[3:11:40] <+Shockrates20XX> Probably make them a one-time single player experience, or just a light party dungeon?
[3:11:40] <%ssjklyco> MMO term
[3:11:40] <%RedKnightVI> Think there's any chance they update the voices to match the new ones?
[3:11:43] <+ktothec99> I'm stuck in the level 50 pre-heavensward stuff
[3:11:44] <@mothmandraws> and put all msq themed dungeons in roullete
[3:11:44] <ashe_strachan> @PatStaresAt where on the balance discord is the gatherin/crafting info?
[3:11:45] <Visorak6> They said they were going to make castrum and praetorium 4 mans werent they?

[3:11:50] <+Magick_Man> Pat I just got a HQ Sothis (One of the big blue fish from ocean fishing)
[3:11:54] <%spiritofmojave> They should keep MSQ for those big ass bonuses
[3:11:58] <%dekkitout> Is Alt Pat a version of Pat that wears stripes rather than plaid?
[3:12:00] <+HelloImTom08> i dotn think so
[3:12:00] <Visorak6> Its uh with raubahn and npc's
[3:12:01] <+CynicalCobalt> I doubt it
[3:12:02] <cherrycottontail> turn castrum and prae into a 70 minute mega dungeon
[3:12:03] <@mothmandraws> so castrum, prae, amourot, final stb dungeon
[3:12:04] <Xelhesia> doubt it
[3:12:05] <%chhdez> Diet Pat

[3:12:08] <s1rcuit> Probably means Angriest Pat
[3:12:08] <+Shockrates20XX> Yeah but bring back old Merlwyb
[3:12:13] <%WhereIsWill> I'd hope so, but nah too much unneeded work
[3:12:17] <%Futurecity10> Can they just patch Minfillia out?
[3:12:23] <+Deosier> i like that moth
[3:12:25] <%2DSuperiority> "You're too bloody useful"
[3:12:26] <GingerSen> There is data mine info of height markers being added along with flight barriers in ARR areas

[3:12:41] <%chaumiester> You could jerk off underneath a blanket... that's pretty chill
[3:12:41] <Monkeyweed21> As an addendum to the Podcast talk, the SFV netcode patch was a significant improvement for most, as shown by Maximillian DOOD. Woolie didn't see any change because he hasn't updated Windows in months
[3:12:46] <%ssjklyco> Gonna need coats for all this chill
[3:12:48] <%kyh9> Did you hear the Lotus from fucking Warframe is going to be a spirit in Smash?

[3:14:54] <%ssjklyco> OMG, Pat Stares At rendition of RENT
[3:15:05] <B1G_DADDY_ADAM> The Devil doesn't pay his rent!
[3:15:05] <yourliteraldog> We will never never pay rent again
[3:15:09] <%hrudzie_1> Ever considered a diablo 3 stream>
[3:15:10] <@mothmandraws> use MSQ for 1 character, maybe grab a 2nd for non msq stuff
[3:15:16] <%Iwantscandy> Iwantscandy subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Guess you're getting this free rent money then
[3:15:17] <%InugamiTheHound> Yo pat I just got done streaming "world of final fantasy" and I saw that you were streaming ff14. Go FF games, hey everyone ion the chat
[3:15:22] <VirtuaRailith> I will die of AIDS before I pay rent
[3:15:22] <%2DSuperiority> Armory Bonus too
[3:15:23] <%tusk102> pat stares at RENT
[3:15:32] <@mothmandraws> tell that to meg
[3:15:32] <%YakumoYomi> I'd love a contemporary Rent that's just about people not wanting to pay for a sub to get in a sub-only discord channel
[3:15:35] <Visorak6> You will usually get more than enough exp to cap a job before you're done with MSQ so you can switch partway through if you want
[3:15:40] <%DensityD> everyone has aids
[3:15:44] <%TONYOO101> has pat ever done savage raids?
[3:15:45] <%ssjklyco> I like that compared to WoW. Don't have to make multiple characters
[3:15:45] <%Ilpala> don't fuckin judge me
[3:15:46] <@mothmandraws> he plays 1 character with us for savage raid and his other main for RP
[3:15:52] <%Verd_254> job that is
[3:15:55] <SpaceQueenLiv> roger roger boss
[3:15:55] <DazzlingFuhrer> The only reason you'd ever want to play more than one character is if you have friends on other servers.
[3:16:03] <$SirGO0SE> btw @PatStaresAt have you seen Besieged?
[3:16:04] <Monkeyweed21> When's the BLU levelling stream?
[3:16:13] <@mothmandraws> monkey that would last 10 mins
[3:16:19] <yourliteraldog> Pat works as lalafel call boy on balmung
[3:16:20] <@mothmandraws> get 6 lvl 80s
[3:16:24] <%crimsonharvest> Those aren't real friends lets be honest
[3:16:25] <+theaceclaw> MSQ is so tedious. I have to do some post ARR questchain now before I get to Heavensward. FeelsBadMan
[3:16:27] <Visorak6> Server transfers are like 18 bucks
[3:16:32] <%Alpha8087> HYPERION REPRESENT
[3:16:32] <%chambatron> Hey Pat I wanted to lvl pretty much everything up until 35 on the trial and then start the subscription. What do you think?
[3:16:33] <@mothmandraws> you target an enemy in azys la and have them kill
[3:16:34] <%MaddyCaddy> You can also have cross world friends
[3:16:36] <@mothmandraws> gives you ton of xp
[3:16:40] <%Dapper_Cactuar> unfortunately everyone I know is split across all 3 datacenters
[3:16:46] <%AnIcedCoffee> My friend recently grinded an alt to cap in a week because she wanted to. She's mad.
[3:16:50] <@mothmandraws> as blue mages get boosted overworld xp
[3:16:50] <Kain5707> Behemoth hype
[3:16:52] <%moogleboy1984> I remade on Leviathan rather than buy a transfer
[3:16:54] <+CynicalCobalt> Pray for me. It is time for my MSQ Roulette
[3:16:54] <Monkeyweed21> Why haven't you done BLU yet?
[3:16:58] <%moogleboy1984> Then they made server hop
[3:17:09] <+Sassafras1594> alts are useful to raid with multiple people
[3:17:13] <DeaconTNR> @chambatron that would be a goood amount of work
[3:17:16] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt I feel like starting FF14 before the ARR rework patch because I HAVE TO KNOW before it's gone. How bad of an idea is this?
[3:17:17] <%tusk102> nearly 100 people are watching you hit some fucking rocks @PatStaresAt
[3:17:18] <%spiritofmojave> Datacenter hops unfortunately think cut off your friends with your main, miss a buddy who moved from Levi
[3:17:18] <%Alpha8087> Like Cataclysm but better
[3:17:19] <%DjFrostBite95> rooD
[3:17:19] <Kirijuo> Man, I remember when Worlds didn't even have cross world party finder
[3:17:19] <cherrycottontail> cataclysm 2
[3:17:19] <Fathuran> D:
[3:17:20] <+HelloImTom08> that all sounds neat
[3:17:20] <GingerSen> feelin
[3:17:22] <TriggerTripping> lol warframe in smash
[3:17:22] <GingerSen> Blu?
[3:17:25] <%chambatron> Why @DeaconTNR ?
[3:17:25] <+HelloImTom08> yea Blue is just kinda lame
[3:17:27] <Finaldragoon> but it's the best job in the game
[3:17:30] <%miguelrod777> blue mage
[3:17:30] <suikudo> BLU can suck my ass in a way that i similar to the way it sucks pats ass
[3:17:33] <Fathuran> May I ask why?
[3:17:33] <+warswine555> Hey Pat, do you think monk might get a rework soon? It has a lot of super niche skills and doesn't change much from 50 onward.
[3:17:35] <%Puhff> enbJessica
[3:17:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Whats blu?
[3:17:37] <%DedlokPM> @GingerSen Blue Mage
[3:17:38] <Visorak6> Judge if you're willing to put up with tedious questlines zam
[3:17:38] <%tusk102> nearly 1k people are watching you hit some fucking rocks
[3:17:38] <RubberFistFight> yeah fuck you Blue. (who is blue and why fuck them?)
[3:17:40] <%Puhff> Wow
[3:17:41] <Xelhesia> lol
[3:17:44] <ammobasket> Suck it, Blues!
[3:17:47] <Frostydough1> What is it? Like 190 something spells for blu right?
[3:17:48] <%chronoxgp> I picked up the Mana art book, it's pretty sweet.
[3:17:48] <+HelloImTom08> lvling blue was fun but theres nothing to do as blue
[3:17:49] <Visorak6> Monk is in a great spot
[3:17:49] <%Dapper_Cactuar> blue mage is fun once you get a bunch of abilities but before that it's PAINFUL
[3:17:50] <%MaddyCaddy> The best job is the one you think is the most fun
[3:17:51] <%spiritofmojave> [screams in anatman]
[3:17:51] <wqorst> why is he grinding ishgard stuff?
[3:17:52] <%DedlokPM> @XeroSigmaPrime Blue Mage
[3:17:52] <%Alpha8087> Man BLU was fun in FFXI whyd they ruin it with the no content shit
[3:17:53] <+HelloImTom08> Monk is fine
[3:17:53] <haisho> they already got a rework
[3:17:56] <Monkeyweed21> MNK is REAL good
[3:17:57] <ashe_strachan> @PatStaresAt I play a bun bun,you think we will ever get to wear hats?
[3:18:00] <%ImmaCanuck> I like MNK!
[3:18:01] <suikudo> Thank fucking god
[3:18:01] <Visorak6> Monk is best aoe clear in the game
[3:18:02] <@mothmandraws> only jobs in "bad" spot is probably machinist
[3:18:04] <%spiritofmojave> it's way better now for sure
[3:18:06] <NemokillerV> Monk = Gotta go Fast
[3:18:06] <@mothmandraws> and machinist just needs more damage
[3:18:08] <yourliteraldog> He is beating wood not hitting rocks
[3:18:12] <GingerSen> Dragoon has been solid for 2 expansions now
[3:18:12] <+MoonObscure> ;w;
[3:18:12] <+CynicalCobalt> MNK is strong but long time MNK players are not happy with the state of the job.
[3:18:21] <Xelhesia> nah astro
[3:18:25] <%ShichiNoBushi> Tiny hats for rabbit ladies.
[3:18:26] <%Faustgesicht> AST isn't great right now
[3:18:28] <@mothmandraws> astros only issue is mp
[3:18:28] <SomersaultJustice> I like monk now a lot more than stormblood
[3:18:32] <%Laecerelius> Pat is Minecrafting
[3:18:32] <%AnIcedCoffee> MCH is fun now
[3:18:32] <kiso52> floof
[3:18:32] <+wjones0415> will SMN get a rework?
[3:18:33] <%SomeSageAdvice> MCH is super boring unfortunately, despite being an ok class
[3:18:34] <Monkeyweed21> @mothmandraws machinist has good damage tho, just a rotation thats too tight
[3:18:37] <%DensityD> good song
[3:18:37] <%miguelrod777> yeah Astro makes me sad it was my favorite healer
[3:18:37] <faldin> what about BLM with 4 or so spells that useless at 80
[3:18:38] <yourliteraldog> Beating wood live on stream
[3:18:39] <%hrudzie_1> Newbie here, jobs in an MMO?
[3:18:39] <@mothmandraws> ppl use astro in TEA for fastest clears
[3:18:40] <SlimeSlimeSlime> You can beat wood while I saw logs! Goodnight!
[3:18:40] <Manwad> i did
[3:18:41] <%Verd_254> I changed off viera because of that. What is point of woman if no hat
[3:18:42] <%DensityD> Canadian top 40
[3:18:42] <Kirijuo> Astro is in a real bad spot rn
[3:18:42] <bestwaifuritsu> smn has gotten so many fucking reworks
[3:18:43] <+HelloImTom08> asto is like the best healer right now
[3:18:46] <%Ilpala> SMN has been getting reworks
[3:18:47] <%Dapper_Cactuar> I hope the rumors of Chemist and Mystic Knight getting added in the next expansion end up being true
[3:18:47] <WzillNJ> astros are fine, ranged physical dps are kinda suck right now because there's no real reason to bring them over casters
[3:18:49] <+Dogbert24> whats wrong with mch i got it to 80 and it seemed fine
[3:18:51] <%dekkitout> Yes
[3:18:51] <+MoonObscure> AYYYY
[3:18:51] <SomersaultJustice> I wish we still had double tornado kick rotation, that was fun
[3:18:51] <wqorst> yes
[3:18:51] <Finaldragoon> wjones0415 SMN got 2 reworks already this expansion alone, no more
[3:18:52] <%VashyronM> gross
[3:18:52] <DazzlingFuhrer> Yes.
[3:18:52] <yourliteraldog> Yes tbh
[3:18:53] <%DensityD> that baby psaWink
[3:18:53] <TriggerTripping> Did chat see the thing about the lotus spirit in smash?
[3:18:56] <%Valdorick> DSP
[3:18:57] <GingerSen> hatch cha cha
[3:18:57] <Monkeyweed21> MCH has good damage but you need good ping
[3:18:58] <DeaconTNR> @chambatron I mean it would just take a while to do lol you'll def decide if you like the game after that! 😂
[3:18:59] <%moogleboy1984> [DSPat Intensifies]
[3:19:00] <%TheSniperJoe> Yeah if I'm being honest, it felt kinda inevitiable
[3:19:02] <+Drasell> Elmo is too cuteeee
[3:19:03] <@mothmandraws> Astro is liked in speed kills as it+white mage is best damage healers
[3:19:03] <onetrueking27> ranged physical as a whole is underwhelming right now :(

[3:42:27] <%DensityD> the bicycle has a stand
[3:42:29] <Hydrapissed> its that and the slam u always remember the slam u take
[3:42:30] <%ssjklyco> You learn about physics from that.
[3:42:31] <$correctedsun117> @PatStaresAt I once was doing 20 mph downhill on a scooter, set my foot on the ground like a dumbass, and did a full head-over heels flip onto my ass

[3:42:43] <haisho> I can't believe Pat's bike was actually King Crimson
[3:42:45] <%SirGO0SE> we all started our lives as projectiles
[3:42:52] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt my parents did that "go outside" thing too and i'm 19 right now. Meaning they were telling me that shit in like 2008 and WHAT KIDS WERE PLAYING OUTSIDE IN 2008?!?
[3:42:54] <%dekkitout> I've been a projectile a few times in my boyhood (un)fortunately

[3:43:05] <Xelhesia> No handlebars, No handlebars
[3:43:07] <Hydrapissed> u ever do the side saddle on ur bike?
[3:43:07] <Darkrenai> Mum is just jealous
[3:43:08] <%ssjklyco> Fun Fact: Science still doesn't understand how a bike stays up.
[3:43:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> As another ADHD gremlin, Peach, I can always tell when my focus mana pool runs out cause when it does I nearly forget how to fucking operate doors.
[3:43:11] <Hydrapissed> just coast
[3:43:11] <%InvisibleMan101> but Pat, you fit so well in a catapult
[3:43:14] <%falineth> for me I tend to freeze up and basicly go oh I guess this is happening

[3:44:17] <RubberFistFight> @falineth I hate the "moment of no return" when you stack it and eat shit off a bike, like, you know what's about to happen but you're in a slice of time that's just outside of the point where you could stop it.

[4:03:49] <$Chimeraelite> You dig in far enough you can get your fingernails all the way into the back of the tooth. From there it's just a matter of leverage

[4:04:10] <Monkeyweed21> Did anyone else have their second teeth come in before losing their baby teeth? The adult tooth basically rips its way out of the gum above the baby tooth
[4:04:14] <$correctedsun117> NIce

[4:05:23] <%mrjplays2k9> that silence was deafening
[4:05:23] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> what a story
[4:05:29] <Monkeyweed21> see kids, horribly injure yourselves to get WHATEVER you want

[4:06:32] <VirtuaRailith> Medical stuff doesn't bother me anymore after my mom let me watch her do eye surgery
[4:06:40] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Wisdom teeth fucked up my teeth badly, didnt have insurance. Finally got insurance and now have braces to fix all this shit
[4:06:42] <%depressed_skeleton> its important Peach!
[4:06:44] <gekizenbu> pat is made of infinite migranes confirmed

[4:07:09] <%tusk102> my wisdom teeth haven't grown in and i REALLY hope they don't
[4:07:13] <+mankeyfigh> Molly Percocet
[4:07:14] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt aren't you unnaturally resistant to painkillers though, due in part to ginger genetics (since painkiller tolerance seems linked to that somehow)
[4:07:18] <StarlitStunner> doodTerror
[4:07:21] <%Xooler67> mask off
[4:07:24] <%EternalInquisitor> everything Pat does is a disorder.
[4:07:24] <%Oxybe> fuck putting new false teeth. I tell the dentist to yank that shit out and shove gauze in my mouth for an afternoon. I smile like an old-timey hockey player right now.
[4:07:27] <%cappyd33> cappyd33 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 5 month streak! pat's teeth adventures are a great backdrop to leveling carpenter

[4:07:48] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @PatStaresAt Wait, didnt this shit cost fucking tens of thousands of dollars?
[4:07:53] <%depressed_skeleton> thats understandable
[4:07:55] <Hydrapissed> I wouldnt have said anything pat

[4:08:49] <sentientvin> can't eat but isn't necessary??
[4:08:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Do a lot of Canadian companies offer dental/eye care?
[4:08:51] <Monkeyweed21> you don't NEED teeth
[4:08:52] <%XeroSigmaPrime> MAN IF ONLY SOME CANDIDATE IN THE US WANTED TO FIX THIS BULLSIHT HUH?
[4:08:52] <kingbaconcrispy> That's why I never go to the dentist!!!!!
[4:08:53] <%GarbageNirvana> Eh, just get wooden ones
[4:08:54] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt how the fuck is needing a bone graft not "reconstructive"? Osteomyelitis is no fucking joke and your tooth sockets rotting away can lead to that.

[4:10:06] <%Oxybe> nope. I can get my insurance to partially cover remve a wisdom tooth because that's surgery but get them fake teeth put in. As far as healthcare is concerned, the cost is nice but the waiting lines are terrible.
[4:10:08] <%dekkitout> Phrasing*

[4:10:52] <$correctedsun117> Shit sucks
[4:10:52] <%XeroSigmaPrime> The trick for Wisdom teeth is to get hthem removed before they grow out of your gums, that way Health can usually cover it over dental

[4:12:10] <ThespianBarrage> I want gas. I only had 5 needles.
[4:12:12] <yourliteraldog> Nitrous is awesome
[4:12:14] <+hamhog> Horse tranquilizer
[4:12:14] <thelonechris> They put you on Nos?
[4:12:15] <ferbz5life> fart gas??
[4:12:16] <Monkeyweed21> you should try whipits
[4:12:17] <+mankeyfigh> Okay chat, this seems like a really boring way to gain levels, is there nothing better?
[4:12:20] <zamzoph> I was put out for my wisdom teeth and came to while mom was driving me back home
[4:12:22] <kysath> The only good part of getting the wisdom teeth removed was the endless pudding and mashed potatoes I survived on
[4:12:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Monkeyweed21 Nooooo
[4:12:24] <%rdark_ksu> nitrus is some shit man
[4:12:25] <%DensityD> so much fart gas
[4:12:25] <%depressed_skeleton> I had to get a cracked wisdom tooth removed & they were pulling that shit hard.
[4:12:26] <%shurtal> I MIGHT have a pain medication intolerance, i was hit with one dose of morphine when i was in the ER with my pulmonary embolism, and i felt it for like 3 seconds, and then it wore off. Fuck me.
[4:12:26] <+fromnibelheim> got that during my root canal, I had such a good time lmfao
[4:12:27] <+YamadaZero> They gave me valium when I had it done, Pat.
[4:12:28] <%dekkitout> No cap gas is very based
[4:12:30] <ThespianBarrage> "You'll feel some pressure" THAT'S NOT PRESSURE. They try and break your neck!
[4:12:32] <%SirGO0SE> Dentists ruin their lives over that gas
[4:12:32] <haisho> @mankeyfigh Welcome to leveling crafters
[4:12:35] <%depressed_skeleton> No gas tho
[4:12:37] <Monkeyweed21> gas is greaaatttt

[4:12:53] <%tusk102> woof
[4:13:01] <%Nobrev> @mankeyfigh in order to level a crafting job one must craft
[4:13:06] <yourliteraldog> I hung out with hippies in college, I can attest whip its rule
[4:13:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait 9? You don't do every 6?
[4:13:08] <+mankeyfigh> @haisho What are crafters good for?

[4:13:20] <haisho> getting all of the money?
[4:13:20] <+waltzqueen> oh no
[4:13:20] <%DedlokPM> @mankeyfigh crafting stuff
[4:13:21] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt it's kinda like when they gotta do brain surgery on you and they take the top of your head off. They just load you the fuck up on benzodiazepenes so you're physically incapable of feeling anxious.
[4:13:22] <%miguelrod777> im 21 and i havent gotten them out yet rip
[4:13:29] <dan_g_v> hey people, still fishing?
[4:13:31] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Got two shots one time- one for nausea, one to knock me out. My insomnia meant I never went to sleep. Wasn't nauseous anymore, tho
[4:13:42] <%dekkitout> I'm not sure if mine even 'grew'
[4:13:44] <%Futurecity10> MORE PEOPLE ARE JOINING
[4:13:49] <Monkeyweed21> I got all 4 wisdom teeth removed at once, it was fine
[4:13:50] <%Fenrirlives> 23 and they're still in. I'm gonna fuckin die
[4:13:52] <zamzoph> 3 weeks?!
[4:13:57] <%tusk102> oh no

[4:14:03] <yourliteraldog> Impacted bowl
[4:14:05] <Quivla> i'm 24 and my bottom wisdom teeth never came in and my top ones don't exist.
[4:14:07] <+waltzqueen> DAMN
[4:14:09] <%Verd_254> i'm 29, got mine take out last year after I realized half of one corroded off.
[4:14:10] <%cvp5127> the whole foot?
[4:14:10] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[4:14:10] <%miguelrod777> damn
[4:14:11] <%tusk102> @Fenrirlives they don't grow in sometimes
[4:14:11] <RubberFistFight> @dekkitout yeah i'm a couple months from 37 and I've literally never had a problem with them. Apparently they're in there, but not really DOING anything.
[4:14:12] <%DjFrostBite95> Oh god
[4:14:13] <Ciglossonjr> Holy fucking shit
[4:14:14] <+palebluedots> DAMN
[4:14:15] <zamzoph> CA dentists LUL
[4:14:15] <%thegreenbenis> MY DENTIST HAD TO DO THAT TO ME TOO @PatStaresAt
[4:14:18] <%ssjklyco> It was a WISE decision to remove them it seems.
[4:14:18] <haisho> damn that's a real bad impaction
[4:14:20] <yourliteraldog> Yank it boi
[4:14:21] <Skelex> I'm a luck asshole, I was born without wisdom teeth
[4:14:21] <%TheSniperJoe> Soon to be played by Captain America.
[4:14:22] <%trustycoyote> Holy shit!
[4:14:23] <SoySocks> that dentist is COOL though
[4:14:27] <twoto858> the one that Chris Evans wants to play?
[4:14:32] <%depressed_skeleton> My dentist had to shatter my cracked tooth & pull it out piece by piece.
[4:14:34] <ThespianBarrage> They couldn't pull mine, they had to use the bone drill for my impacted wisdoms.
[4:14:35] <Hydrapissed> I had one of mine sawed out
[4:14:35] <+waltzqueen> im 26 and mine need to come out. Im so terrified of the money ill spend and the pain
[4:14:36] <kysath> @PatStaresAt what was your food of choice during wisdom tooth recovery?
[4:14:36] <%RealThiele> dry socket is also fun
[4:14:38] <tactician0> I'm 24 and still have mine :c
[4:14:38] <%TheWinged7> On the topic of high pain tolerances, it turns out strangely i don't have a high pain tolerance, it just literally feels like someone pressing on the spot during the "warning" stages of pain before you actually injure yourself
[4:14:43] <zamzoph> Pat fell
[4:14:44] <DestroyerPhoenix> Quivla it's the other way around for me :D
[4:14:46] <smugjorgen98> Dentist: YOU ARE GETTING OUT OF THERE MAN
[4:14:51] <%Verd_254> yogurt
[4:14:54] <+YamadaZero> I am glad you are feeling better Pat.
[4:14:56] <Monkeyweed21> ehh Wisdom teeth dont hurt that much
[4:14:59] <$correctedsun117> The dentist fucking SHOT THE NOVA INTO THE DRILLED HOLE in my tooth, my resistance was so strong
[4:15:00] <%dekkitout> @RubberFistFight They're pretty vestigial from what a dental student told me
[4:15:00] <%Verd_254> and scrambled eggs
[4:15:01] <%tusk102> @tactician0 they might not need to be removed
[4:15:02] <Gameaholic42> Were they all the way in by that point or were they just pressing against something the wrong way?
[4:15:04] <+YamadaZero> I bet you're glad it was over and done with though, eh?
[4:15:04] <%depressed_skeleton> I am cursed with Horse teeth. Very hard to remove.
[4:15:07] <ThespianBarrage> @Monkeyweed21 LUL
[4:15:07] <SoySocks> and then you got to pick the food shit out of your tooth holes, right?
[4:15:07] <dan_g_v> soup is badass
[4:15:08] <yourliteraldog> You cant tell me what to do MOM
[4:15:10] <Monkeyweed21> pudding
[4:15:11] <+hamhog> Who won?
[4:15:13] <%StrawberryPantsu> Real fun getting your wisdom teeth taken out when you're going through Basic training. Dentist "Say 'Ahhhh' if it hurts okay?" Me:"Ahhhhhh!" Dentist would just keep pullin no care in the world....
[4:15:15] <%rdark_ksu> @PatStaresAt What ice cream do you like?
[4:15:15] <bestwaifuritsu> You walked away from all this without sensitivity problems?
[4:15:16] <Frostydough1> @PatStaresAt my last molar is fucking intertwined with my gums so i need special surgery for it and im putting that shit off as MUCH as i can
[4:15:18] <TonberryLives> Got mine out in senior year of high school. Basically all of my headaches vanished. Get your fucking wisdom teeth removed people.
[4:15:25] <%thebeargoesHONK> i'm surprised Pat isn't using up his leves
[4:15:40] <MayorRev> Remind me again what pat's doing while he's chatting with us?
[4:15:42] <+mankeyfigh> Fuck braces
[4:15:43] <Quivla> @DestroyerPhoenix it might be the same for me too, now that i'm thinking about it... but at least i don't have to live this nightmare
[4:15:45] <%DracaenaLeaf> I had that too but got it removed recently so I could clean my teeth better.
[4:15:53] <+mankeyfigh> Dodged that shit super hard
[4:15:57] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> That was like when a doctor I was shadowing popped a lady's hip back in. Stood on the bed and shimmied that baby back in the socket. Made a loud, low pitch POP
[4:16:03] <%tusk102> oh god yeah
[4:16:08] <%GarbageNirvana> I had to get a palate spreader in when I got mine
[4:16:15] <%joylent_blue> DON'T EAT A HOTDOG
[4:16:16] <%medusasghost> getting braces tightened was the worst
[4:16:18] <RubberFistFight> @TonberryLives addendum: only get them removed if you need to. If they're not causing problems, the surgery to extract them can actually make problems happen.
[4:16:19] <%tusk102> OH BOY
[4:16:20] <%rdark_ksu> mashed potatoes
[4:16:21] <%GarbageQueenEllie> aww
[4:16:21] <%joylent_blue> THE BREAD KILLS YOU
[4:16:21] <%GarbageNirvana> Which basically meant they were progressively widening my skull to let my teeth grow in

[4:16:33] <dan_g_v> thats not soft food
[4:16:36] <%DracaenaLeaf> wtf kind of hotdog was that lmao
[4:16:37] <%ssjklyco> I was told I would have to have my tonsils removed if I ever got strep throat again as I used to get it a lot as a child. I think I may have willed myself to never get strep throat again because I feared having them removed.
[4:16:42] <Hydrapissed> girls can pull off anything

[4:19:36] <Hydrapissed> SHAKE her PAT
[4:19:39] <+waltzqueen> SIPSIP
[4:19:39] <$correctedsun117> YOURE GONA STARVE
[4:19:40] <VidulaSaix> Thats why I was wondering why you're doing this method cause leves are nuts now
[4:19:40] <%depressed_skeleton> Shes high
[4:19:40] <yourliteraldog> They should add accountant
[4:19:41] <%TheWinged7> psaBig 2
[4:19:41] <%ssjklyco> Object permanence gone
[4:19:42] <%DensityD> so much ganja
[4:19:43] <%RealThiele> super high on sundown
[4:19:45] <%mMayrro> D:
[4:19:46] <Jdrockefeller> HQ Leves for crafting are the majority of my crafting leveling
[4:19:48] <FalseEyeD> High Stream
[4:19:48] <%Fenrirlives> is that a Vergil cosplayer in the background?
[4:19:50] <%EternalInquisitor> @PatStaresAt I need my wisdom teeth out, thank you for filling my soul with deep and abiding fear, you bastard
[4:19:51] <%AnIcedCoffee> HQ leves are ridiculous
[4:19:51] <%Zepik> I took CRP from 60-80 in an evening for like 500k
[4:19:54] <dickbuttwoman> Unless they upped it for 5.2, it took me forever that way in 5.0
[4:19:54] <@mothmandraws> im getting 2 levels from GC hand ins at 70 its nuts
[4:19:58] <yourliteraldog> Get that kush
[4:19:59] <%marsantas> Bless her heart
[4:20:01] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> Instant disgust
[4:20:03] <%SirGO0SE> wine sounds pretty good right now
[4:20:04] <Sunstalker> I feel like the backbrace thing can really lean into the bondage fetishes kinamaBlele
[4:20:05] <%Xooler67> she's not like most girls
[4:20:07] <%RealThiele> beast tribes for lazy leveling
[4:20:11] <%depressed_skeleton> Its sad that paige died from drinking all that weed juice.
[4:20:11] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> GC hand ins? @mothmandraws
[4:20:11] <Frostydough1> wow so quirky
[4:20:12] <+mankeyfigh> Tf is open this late
[4:20:13] <mattdel92> Special drunk for special gurl
[4:20:14] <%DensityD> YEAH PRETTY MUCH
[4:20:15] <KoyaMusa> oh the triple leves are disgusting
[4:20:21] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt have you done crystarium deliveries as well?
[4:20:22] <Riku9105> SHES NOT LIKE MOST GIRLS chariMEGA chariMEGA
[4:20:23] <@mothmandraws> grand company hand ins
[4:20:25] <+HelloImTom08> yea GC handins are super worth doing
[4:20:28] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Im not like OTHER girls. I wear STRIPED shirts under my TSHIRT
[4:20:30] <%RealThiele> deliveries are great exp
[4:20:30] <%GarbageNirvana> When I was getting fitted for my braces my orthodontist decided my upper jaw needed more space to let my teeth settle in so he installed a palate spreader, which is basically a device you crank out with a key every so often to gradually expand your skull. I can still feel the seam that formed in the roof of my mouth as a result
[4:20:34] <%thebeargoesHONK> Hey Pat, still playing League?
[4:20:36] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> I have no idea what that is...
[4:20:36] <%TheShal> How much weed oil has Paige done?
[4:20:37] <%depressed_skeleton> Peach don't lie you totally have.
[4:20:41] <Monkeyweed21> she snorted the weedz
[4:20:41] <DazzlingFuhrer> The deliveries in the crystarium are way better.
[4:20:42] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> I'm out on the loop
[4:20:42] <%depressed_skeleton> You've injected at least 5 weeds.
[4:20:45] <@mothmandraws> I sometimes just buy the stuff its often only 1-2k per item to save time
[4:20:49] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt DO THEM ITS SHIT TONS OF EXP
[4:20:52] <%RealThiele> when you lazy grind use manuals
[4:20:52] <%ssjklyco> Stop phoning it in paige.
[4:20:54] <%SoFarFetched> He quit league like MONTHS ago
[4:21:05] <+HelloImTom08> the delivers are also a whole 2/3 lvls and you have to do them eventally
[4:21:08] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> @GarbageNirvana celtisStunned
[4:21:09] <mattdel92> She put the weed up the butt to absorb it more
[4:21:17] <+RandyMarshUSA> what is Pat Staring at
[4:21:18] <%DEETRz> big dick gorilla mount
[4:21:19] <$Dakuu75> @GarbageNirvana that sounds like a literal torture device
[4:21:20] <+Deosier> harambe
[4:21:20] <%AnIcedCoffee> True
[4:21:21] <yourliteraldog> They do make weed lube
[4:21:24] <@mothmandraws> also the mount/emote/glam sells for decent
[4:21:25] <+HelloImTom08> those scrips are worth as well
[4:21:27] <%depressed_skeleton> Why not make a wood mount?
[4:21:27] <fiercefiresoul> Crystarium deliveries make getting a single job from 70-80 really, really easy.
[4:21:33] <%RealThiele> i want great serpent mount so bad
[4:21:34] <%GarbageNirvana> @Dakuu75 I wouldn't be surprised if it found use in medieval times
[4:21:38] <Ciglossonjr> I had a sideways tooth that needed to be cranked down via gold chain when I had my braces. Then When it got cranked down we also realized that it was also fucking facing 180 degrees the wrong way and needed to be turned. That shit fucking sucked
[4:21:39] <+HelloImTom08> slash lean is the best emote
[4:21:42] <kysath> @DEETRz You mean small dick gorilla mount, if we're being accurate
[4:21:43] <%DensityD> this is a good background dancer
[4:21:48] <SoySocks> dude michael jackson is behind you PogChamp PogChamp

[4:22:40] <%Fenrirlives> BOO GO BACK TO VERGIL. COSPLAY
[4:22:40] <%TheShal> It takes almost no time to go from 70 to 80
[4:22:46] <VidulaSaix> He may be out of date because 70-80 in Leves take you 5 minutes with turnins
[4:22:48] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> @Kung_Fu_KaiTV LUL
[4:22:50] <fiercefiresoul> The restoration is easily the fastest.
[4:22:54] <+VHGS> pretty much everything is fast, so you might as well do this so you work towards something else
[4:22:55] <%thebeargoesHONK> did you do the weekly turn in for your free 2 levels?
[4:22:55] <RubberFistFight> Reporter trying to talk about the latest crime to be did, and some dipshit's in the background doing the robot.
[4:22:58] <fiercefiresoul> It's the only reason I've leveled crafters at all.
[4:22:59] <%RealThiele> i did 15-75 mining in about 6 hours
[4:23:00] <yourliteraldog> HE HE
[4:23:08] <$correctedsun117> It's pretty outside the wheelhouse, but any interest in Dreams?
[4:23:10] <Serge_12> Pat, what do you think of the Victrix Arcade Stick?
[4:23:17] <MayorRev> SHAMON
[4:23:23] <+HelloImTom08> not super interested in the gorilla mount, the pvp robots are way cooler
[4:23:27] <mattdel92> I think someone knows about this stream
[4:23:32] <MayorRev> look at this legend
[4:23:34] <Ultimatefool> Just checked, 1 triple turn in HQ leve gives you an entire level at 70
[4:23:34] <+RandyMarshUSA> Are We Watching Pat Stare At Grinding Levels In world of warcraft?
[4:23:35] <Kung_Fu_KaiTV> there, dancing vergil there you go

[4:27:39] <+HelloImTom08> same, chemist pls
[4:27:40] <%RealThiele> RLM was nostalgic about voyager thats how bad trek is now

[4:27:42] <kysath> How often do you actually eat McDonalds Paige?
[4:27:44] <@mothmandraws> chemist is fftactics
[4:27:44] <%hrudzie_1> this whole MMO job thing is so confusing
[4:27:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> That man has been dancing for almost half an hour.
[4:27:49] <+HelloImTom08> they talked about making chemist for HW so lets hope
[4:27:51] <Xelhesia> JUST SMASH POTIONS ON PEOPLES HEADS XD
[4:27:54] <SpookyBeef7> Honestly, Chemist being a new healer would make sense.

[4:28:07] <Monkeyweed21> I hope we get Cool Knight as Tank, so we can ditch Dork Knight
[4:28:07] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> look at that man back there
[4:28:08] <%LaughingCatt> Faster but more annoying and/or costyly
[4:28:09] <@mothmandraws> as another dps
[4:28:09] <RubberFistFight> Daily Reminder that Thomas Eugene Paris turned into a lizard and then fucked the shit out of Captain Janeway, who proceeded to give birth to his LIZARD BROOD.
