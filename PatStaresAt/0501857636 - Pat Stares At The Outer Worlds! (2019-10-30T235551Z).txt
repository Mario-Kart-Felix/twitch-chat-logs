[0:12:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> Caesar died to vampires but gave the ring to jojo to save humanity
[0:12:13] <cureneckbeard> That's not true though. Caesarian section was usually fatal to the woman in those days, and Caesar's mother survived and went on to become one of his political advisors
[0:12:14] <%TONYOO101> thought caesar was just some dude who made a lot of pizza

[0:19:19] <@lewdskeletor13> Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 good to see Paige back, I missed the unique flavor she brought. Also, McKinley was a US prez who got killed by an anarchist in the 1900s. In the previews for this game, Tim Cain mentioned that the OW timeline diverged from ours when William McKinley survived his assassination and anti-trust laws were never established. As a future history teacher I thought that was radical. Give Elmo a big pet for me

[0:25:54] <%RubberFistFight> "Hysterical" refers to "uterine hysteresis" which was more or less a belief that a woman was in a state where she needed to get off to calm down. Otherwise called "wandering uterus"

[1:53:36] <UberKingKai> Perception pat!
[1:53:36] <%wsintai> @lewdskeletor13 You actually dont need him to do that peacefully, I didnt, and still got the same result
[1:53:39] <lotharrio> Perception is a stat, not a skill, @GarbageQueenEllie . He can't level it up.
[1:53:53] <lotharrio> He can take drugs to temporarily boost it, though.
[1:53:54] <@lewdskeletor13> @wsintai Oh I know, I just like the dialogue
[1:53:58] <%sectorquack> when in doubt pump hack
[1:54:00] <%Ascethetic> RETURN OF POCKETS
[1:54:01] <+BurkeBigsby> Most skills are pointless. Game ends too quick to not just use speech

[1:55:01] <LodiFrostbeard> brave attempt
[1:55:02] <lotharrio> Pat's BJs are so bad, that people run up to him and make him stop.
[1:55:07] <%Svanyr> Steal his balls
[1:55:09] <chancho4tierra> 60 inspiration is mandatory in my opinion
[1:55:12] <%Kay_Tana> Kay_Tana subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! 15 Like that not so great Final Fantasy.
[1:55:18] <%Animorphimagi> lol

[1:55:26] <+EmotionalFatGuy> I played through the game as melee but there felt like to many instances where it made fights worse.
[1:55:27] <+BurkeBigsby> Just murder for XP. You get nothing of value from NPC's
[1:55:29] <Ultimatefool> @chancho4tierra What does that give you again?

[1:56:05] <osiris1260> theyre literally bandits, just kill them and take their stuff
[1:56:08] <lotharrio> Pat gets permission to do whatever he wants. Proceeds to crawl through garbage.
[1:56:10] <+CanonHusbando> stealth in this is weird beause the game was designed with a stealthy nonlethal playthrough in mind but they had to scrap the mechanic, so the level design is still there but the mechanics arent
[1:56:12] <chancho4tierra> companions give stats 60 inspirations double the bonus
[1:56:15] <Mr_pwng3> oh shit dope
[1:56:17] <+G_Thunders> They were going to let everyone on the ship burn alive. Just kill em
[1:56:23] <+BurkeBigsby> KILL THEM FOR XP! NUMBER GO UP!
[1:56:32] <chancho4tierra> the bonus of companions are obsene in this game

[1:59:42] <%dalmek> Wrestling is already a nerd sport. People are just realizing
[1:59:45] <UberKingKai> Yeah but they also did rick and Morty so wrestling did an equivalent exchange
[1:59:46] <lotharrio> @SvenHolgersson Why? Did they reintroduce necromancy and snake magic to wrestling?

[2:04:43] <%Valdorick> The best thing about this game? You can never be sure if its a bad line read, or just the fact their souls are that crushed.

[2:05:03] <%RubberFistFight> @Valdorick maybe it's a bad line read BECAUSE their souls are crushed.
[2:05:04] <%ryome> I remember in like U5 soccer coming up with a name, the coach's daughter wanted us to be called the Whalers, because she liked whales. It took me the whole season to convince she that Whalers were in fact the people who killed whales, she cried for the rest of the last game.
[2:05:05] <KitsuneManami> @dabeaminator that sucks, its a real shame they put in perma death when Companion AI and health is stupid

[2:06:11] <derap41> Cause pat is klepto
[2:06:14] <lotharrio> @Calamity2007 Because he immediately decided that his noble goals of anarcho communism didn't matter when he really wanted to just steal from the poor.
[2:06:16] <%Ner234> Because MOON GANG, Paige

[2:06:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> Just tinker the hell out of the helmets til they have a decent amount of armor
[2:06:38] <ミュウレ4242> fighting evil by moonlight.
[2:06:41] <derap41> Skills mater more than armor
[2:06:42] <Gruhunchously> If I saw the moon gang in a dark alley, I'd probably crap myself.
[2:06:46] <ミュウレ4242> winning love by daylight.
[2:06:46] <chancho4tierra> what are they going to do when they become hungry after drugs pat
[2:06:49] <%RubberFistFight> @linSP people who play pacifist are cowards. Kappa
[2:06:51] <Dakuu75> @ミュウレ4242 god damn it, XD
[2:06:52] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat Sadly the heavy armor has like 3 different styles and just recolors

[2:08:15] <+TOONFOOD> @kitsunemanami :lul
[2:08:15] <%RubberFistFight> @honeyman18 yup, and the "special fertiliser" back in the botanical garden of the first area in the game is DEAD BODIES.
[2:08:18] <derap41> Montag get it
[2:08:20] <Mrbaconator> farenheight 451
[2:08:27] <derap41> cause 451
[2:08:28] <%GarbageNirvana> That thing rules

[2:08:36] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[2:08:39] <Heyestus> Wow this combat looks almost as good as Fallout 3's
[2:08:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> Make sure you add shock to that Flamethrower and it will kill things real good
[2:08:45] <%Ner234> After all that you still killed them all LUL
[2:08:51] <derap41> Its not a real flame thrower
[2:08:52] <@commanderclaw> Plasma Shock Cannon
[2:08:54] <%honeyman18> This game continually gets me with the gross bioengineered GMO food they eat.
[2:09:05] <Dakuu75> We're still on a space-ship, right now, right? seems dangerous to let everyone have all these guns... on a fucking SPACE SHIP
[2:09:05] <lotharrio> Yeah Pat! You showed that disorderly conducting shroom eater!
[2:09:18] <KitsuneManami> Pat you have the wrong weapon out
[2:09:19] <osiris1260> Its lock-on
[2:09:30] <%sectorquack> #justiceforbolter
[2:09:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> Man. My flamethrower does like 860 DPS.
[2:09:33] <%RubberFistFight> @honeyman18 welcome to the space frontier where Star Trek DOESN'T exist. Resource scarcity is a thing.
[2:09:37] <derap41> You're gonna want to take away Felixs grenade launcher
[2:09:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> That one doesn;t seem that great.
[2:09:45] <LodiFrostbeard> playing this with a controller seems like a pain in the ass
[2:09:49] <RiverBirch> Oh my god
[2:09:57] <%RubberFistFight> @LodiFrostbeard it plays wonderfully on a controller.
[2:09:57] <chancho4tierra> You showed to the druged minorities whos boss

[2:10:06] <trueherobappo> @AngriestPat You had the wrong weapon out brother..
[2:10:22] <Gruhunchously> The moon mask kind of freaks me out
[2:10:36] <derap41> cause it is
[2:10:36] <Jaco_L> xqcGob xqcGob2 hey guys
[2:10:39] <LodiFrostbeard> @RubberFistFight pat seems to be struggling quite a bit with the inventory
[2:10:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> Don;t give Felix guns. Make him dual weild tossball sticks
[2:10:53] <WorldlySlash> @Jaco_L xqcGob xqcGob2
[2:10:58] <%RubberFistFight> @LodiFrostbeard that's a Pat thing, not a controller thing.
[2:10:58] <+G_Thunders> It just shoots red electricity
[2:11:01] <trueherobappo> @AngriestPat Oh, my mistake brother.
[2:11:11] <osiris1260> Its a lock-on flamethrower
[2:11:15] <%linSP> pats gonna hate supernova mode for the packrat he is
[2:11:18] <osiris1260> thats why it didn't work
[2:11:21] <OToole42> do companions use ammo
[2:11:23] <lotharrio> Ladder technology far exceeding that of the Mass Effect series.
[2:11:23] <chancho4tierra> what was the number when chats wrong guys?
[2:11:25] <Dakuu75> well, he keeps getting encumbered but, doesn't wanna level strength or w/e to carry mroe
[2:11:30] <Zombrocom> It's more a plasma beam
[2:11:31] <@lewdskeletor13> @otoole42 Nope
[2:11:31] <LodiFrostbeard> @OToole42 no, thankfully
[2:11:33] <Monkeyweed21> Why did you kill them Pat
[2:11:34] <Zombrocom> Than anything else
[2:11:40] <+BurkeBigsby> There's no point to holding most consumables
[2:11:41] <OToole42> awesome! Thanks
[2:11:42] <%Kirby_Sauce> Kirby_Sauce subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Hey, i'm here on this spaceship too! did pat talk to martin while wearing the mask? No pat, don't kill them! they got stranded here!
[2:11:53] <Sapphire_Breeze> if it was a Bethesda game you could probably clip there
[2:11:55] <+MetroidPrimeRib> there are perks that give you like 100 inventory space
[2:11:56] <%Kirby_Sauce> not if you talked good
[2:12:02] <Monkeyweed21> No they werent
[2:12:03] <lotharrio> Pat killed them because he wanted to steal from the poor.
[2:12:04] <derap41> They're a menace to socieity
[2:12:05] <%Kirby_Sauce> they just wanted to get high
[2:12:07] <%RubberFistFight> @Dakuu75 I'm having the same problem. It's an RPG, I can't NOT loot stuff. If I could mod out equip burden I would, because I fucking hate that mechanic with a passion.
[2:12:13] <+Bluemanzee> You murdered innocent homeless people
[2:12:16] <%dalmek> He talked good and THEN killed them
[2:12:20] <Jaco_L> I tried to beat this game completionist, but I never even met Ellie LUL
[2:12:21] <transporterthesequel> Oh he did talk good, but then he killed them anyway
[2:12:24] <%dalmek> which is kinda worse than just straight murder
[2:12:28] <%linSP> i junk regen shit cuz i despecced that stat entirely
[2:12:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pat "Burn them all" Boivin
[2:12:30] <+TOONFOOD> He turned them into litter
[2:12:32] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Still on the damn groundbreaker
[2:12:35] <%gespenst25> But you didn't ... not ... oh no I've gone cross-eyed
[2:12:38] <StromkoPenguin> They should've kneeled and kissed his feet when he arrived, then they'd still be alive. Patron is merciful
[2:12:41] <lotharrio> They would have accepted bits instead of words or murder.
[2:12:45] <+nekodelic> @angriestpat pickpocket the engineer
[2:12:48] <PkSilent01> @Bluemanzee it's not Murder if theres aren't any witnesses
[2:12:52] <+MetroidPrimeRib> executing a man for something he might have done
[2:13:01] <Graxe_> Just a bug hunt
[2:13:05] <Graxe_> Nothing you can't handle
[2:13:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> Patron is the patron saint of Corporate Shilling for Justice
[2:13:08] <lotharrio> But Pat was very sure that his temporary needs were more important than their lives, like a good Corporate goon.
[2:13:12] <CrypticMochi> Sounds like Pat needs a dumb dialogue play through
[2:13:12] <Dakuu75> @RubberFistFight yeah, because you basically have to waste a stat on a "quality of life" thing. but, I hate having to unload inventory ever 2 minutes
[2:13:13] <LodiFrostbeard> has he seen the mantids before?
[2:13:20] <+Bluemanzee> @PkSilent01 It's simply statistics etalSmug
[2:13:24] <%RubberFistFight> @Dakuu75 sorry, not equip burden - inventory encumbrance. I'm fine with equipped stuff having a weight penalty, just not the all-and-sundry in your bags, which is effectively hammerspace. if you're gonna play the "things have weight" card, then allowing people to carry 4 gigantic guns is asinine. You can't have it both ways.
[2:13:27] <%dekkitout> THIS IS HOW YOU GET CHESTBURSTERS! NotLikeThis
[2:13:44] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat Pat you have a PROBLEM dude
[2:13:51] <+MetroidPrimeRib> stop cucking parvati
[2:13:53] <+BurkeBigsby> nah, just some les
[2:13:57] <%Ner234> Why are you like this?
[2:14:04] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight Sure you can. This game does it lol.
[2:14:10] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat give the card to Parvati. I see no problems there.
[2:14:13] <Dakuu75> @RubberFistFight yeah, I getchya
[2:14:16] <+nekodelic> @angriestpat the door behind her
[2:14:17] <Graxe_> Full of loot
[2:14:19] <+Bluemanzee> So cucumbered
[2:14:25] <%Ner234> You are now a Loot Goblin
[2:14:25] <Gruhunchously> Full to bursting
[2:14:29] <%Piemen99> DUMMY THICC WITH STUFF
[2:14:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> You know Junlei's room is in the room with Junlei
[2:14:33] <%jobbedbone> moonman ::)))
[2:14:35] <Gruhunchously> What does that mean?
[2:14:36] <@lewdskeletor13> Poor Martin
[2:14:38] <Dakuu75> woah... you can pay for them to beat you ? kinky
[2:14:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> He doesn;t sell food. He sells guns. Guns are like superfood.
[2:15:05] <%Kirby_Sauce> pat. put moon men hats on your crew
[2:15:11] <Gruhunchously> Guns can kill you some food
[2:15:16] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Kirby_Sauce He did. ALL of them lol
[2:15:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Kirby He already has
[2:15:20] <%SGrim> Selling your Bolter? HERETIC! SwiftRage
[2:15:21] <+CanonHusbando> give him the stick DONT GIVE HIM THE STICK
[2:15:23] <%Kirby_Sauce> *We're ALL moon men now!*
[2:15:30] <Gruhunchously> @Kirby_Sauce He already sid.
[2:15:30] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger I mean like... You can literally carry around 4 grenade launchers if you want. Where do you put them where you're not holding them? It's unrealistic. Thus rendering the "items have weight because that's how reality works" argument bunk, because you can't store 4 grenade launchers in your butt. Either weightless hammerspace exists, or it doesn't.
[2:15:38] <%dabeaminator> @Kirby_Sauce MOON GANG
[2:15:56] <Dakuu75> BLASPHEMY
[2:15:59] <%jobbedbone> I CARE
[2:16:04] <%Kirby_Sauce> the squatters cared about drugs
[2:16:07] <@commanderclaw> Vape the apple
[2:16:10] <%honeyman18> just inhale all the time
[2:16:11] <%Kirby_Sauce> untill you killed them
[2:16:11] <+MetroidPrimeRib> pat that's a drug
[2:16:18] <%SGrim> @RubberFistFight Who says I can't store man-portable heavy weapons in my ass? THAT'S QUITTER TALK! DatSheffy
[2:16:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RubberFistFight even a bag of holding has an upper limit
[2:16:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Is Pat being the trash lord we all expect tonight?
[2:16:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> All these dang kids, vaping farts out of hobos
[2:16:27] <%Ranryu692> @RubberFistFight you can suspend disbelief that hammerspace exists, but not that items are still affected by gravity while they're in there?
[2:16:58] <Dakuu75> @BallerSwagBro9k yeah, and he keeps singing about it, while he trashes-around lol
[2:16:59] <lotharrio> So Pat, if they see you steal too, will you murder the whole ship?
[2:17:01] <%Kirby_Sauce> why not just store your shit on the ship?
[2:17:06] <+nekodelic> @rubberfistfight it's more like "getting as realistic as possible without being unplayable"
[2:17:11] <%honeyman18> D-Pad down puts them in a spot
[2:17:14] <%Ner234> Oh noooo
[2:17:14] <%RubberFistFight> @Ranryu692 it's not suspension of disbelief that's the problem, it's completely inconsistent application of rules that I have a problem with.
[2:17:16] <Graxe_> Pre-sliced bread
[2:17:17] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight I know what you're saying. But does it matter? It's fine. You get weapon slots to give you the option for variety, and you get a weight limit to keep you from carrying the world around with you. It works out fine.
[2:17:19] <+CanonHusbando> bred
[2:17:20] <+babrukus> yessss he got it
[2:17:20] <Graxe_> Now unsliced
[2:17:21] <%dave323dave> WutFace WutFace
[2:17:23] <derap41> extra protein
[2:17:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> WOO
[2:17:25] <@lewdskeletor13> apatWhat
[2:17:26] <%RubberFistFight> @nekodelic then get rid of hammerspace, since it's blatantly unrealistic.
[2:17:30] <+Bluemanzee> Soylent green is worms
[2:17:30] <lotharrio> Eat your bred noodles, Pat.
[2:17:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> UPPER DECKER
[2:17:38] <%honeyman18> SOFT OR CRUNCHY BUG BREAD?
[2:17:38] <%walternatorz> drop the pre-sliced bread into the toilet
[2:17:43] <%gespenst25> Do andriods dream of electric poop
[2:17:44] <%Animorphimagi> a bidet
[2:17:45] <Dakuu75> HOW... are those worms... bread?! dude, "sprat burgers" and shit. This Space is the worst
[2:17:46] <%Rngiddion> truely the worst thing space capitalism took from us
[2:18:06] <Gruhunchously> Closing the door on NPCs is a time honored tactic.
[2:18:18] <lotharrio> They aren't "bread" @Dakuu75 . They are "bred." Legally distinct.
[2:18:18] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger see, when everyone and their grandma drops 7 metric tons of loot, having an encumbrance limit just becomes irritating and takes you out of the game, simply so you can sit there and fuckin play musical chairs with your inventory.
[2:18:24] <%walternatorz> uhhh did she just itch her mask?
[2:18:25] <+MetroidPrimeRib> yeah I'm an anarcho communist but I also love stealing everything from everyone
[2:18:26] <Dakuu75> @Gruhunchously ever since the butler from tomb raider
[2:18:41] <%Ranryu692> it's bugs
[2:18:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> They're just mantids.
[2:18:43] <Graxe_> Shoot a swarm of bugs
[2:18:49] <Dakuu75> @lotharrio omg, that seems even worse, lol
[2:18:54] <derap41> BIG BREAD
[2:18:57] <Gruhunchously> Holy jesus
[2:18:58] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger note that I'm TOTALLY FINE with people being ok with encumbrance limits. Just elaborating on why I myself am NOT ok with them.
[2:18:59] <trueherobappo> @AngriestPat Did Paige pass out? Or did she just leave the room
[2:19:00] <%jobbedbone> games should idealize a situation whenever it detracts from depth or wastes time
[2:19:00] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:19:02] <%dabeaminator> @RubberFistFight Just don't pick up everything you find. Be selective about your loot.

[2:19:30] <Gruhunchously> It's not an Obsidian game without bugs I guess.
[2:19:36] <Calamity2007> "The mask, it does nothing!"
[2:19:37] <+MetroidPrimeRib> Use plasma or corrosion weapons on the bug swarms
[2:19:41] <%RubberFistFight> @dabeaminator so every time I kill someone I gotta stop for 10 minutes and figure out what I need versus what I can skip? Yeah, coz THAT'S fun.
[2:19:41] <lotharrio> I've seen those mantipillars do dodge rolls to avoid gunshots.
[2:19:43] <Dakuu75> lol
[2:19:46] <%ape_hawk> yes

[2:20:38] <%dabeaminator> @RubberFistFight Deciding "Do I want to pick up this ten pound flamethrower or do I want to scrap it for parts?" takes like half a second.

[2:21:08] <@lewdskeletor13> HELL NO
[2:21:09] <@commanderclaw> The phobias aren't that bad, I think they're worth it. Not this one though
[2:21:09] <%Ranryu692> wow that is so much worse than any of the ones I've gotten
[2:21:09] <+CanonHusbando> one of the worst ones

[2:21:12] <+TechnicolorNinja> No, that is the worst
[2:21:13] <%Valdorick> "Make the entire game slower"
[2:21:13] <StromkoPenguin> 30% is pretty bad for the rest of the game
[2:21:13] <%mortalitas87> seems bad

[2:21:19] <Mornaka> NOT WORTH IT FROM EXPERIENCE
[2:21:19] <%garatrose1> @AngriestPat there are other less garbage ones, reject this one
[2:21:19] <+CanonHusbando> the phobias are the best flaws to take
[2:21:20] <CriticKitten> Time to save scum that shit
[2:21:20] <Top_Lane_Duelist> there are so many others, this one is bad
[2:21:20] <%jobbedbone> WORTH
[2:21:20] <Gruhunchously> I think you should reject that one for the sake of the Stream

[2:21:24] <%tizz86> gravity is a bitch
[2:21:24] <%Animorphimagi> NOT WORTH
[2:21:24] <%SirFancySwank> bad trade
[2:21:26] <%pectusumbra> you need to move FASTER
[2:21:28] <%JustToWatch> that's a really bad one
[2:21:28] <%RyanTheRecluse> This one is bad
[2:21:28] <lotharrio> It takes a perk to fix that.
[2:21:29] <The_Blumper> please reject it
[2:21:29] <+Arsimckhoi> hell no
[2:21:29] <+DRAGKUDO> what happened?

[2:21:30] <Monkeyweed21> YOURE TOO SLOW ALREADY
[2:21:31] <+nekodelic> NOT THE BEST CHOICE
[2:21:33] <%Sadira_snack_attack> Don't take the point
[2:21:33] <%sectorquack> YES
[2:21:33] <%Valdorick> For fucking FIVE traits, maybe

[2:21:39] <trueherobappo> @AngriestPat Good shit brother.
[2:21:42] <%tizz86> #savescum
[2:21:43] <Dakuu75> WAIT it gave you a choice?! lol
[2:21:43] <randoli_spugoli> Reject
[2:21:44] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat Do it you coward!
[2:21:45] <Calamity2007> COWARD
[2:21:45] <%WhereIsWill> fuck no dodges
[2:21:46] <Zombrocom> The perk is 25%, would you take -30% to get +25%? Fuck no
[2:21:46] <%dalmek> my mans walked away from a terminal in front of his face
[2:21:46] <%RyanTheRecluse> There are other ones that are decent trade offs
[2:21:49] <%walternatorz> Think of the perk you could get? It could give +30% movement and the ability to dodge
[2:21:51] <Gruhunchously> Just will those broken legs to be fixed again.
[2:21:52] <%Animorphimagi> there aren't even that many good perks by the time you get to level 30
[2:21:53] <Tersalus> Pat the Unbusted
[2:21:55] <%RubberFistFight> @dabeaminator except it's more than just "ten pound flamethrowers" when everything INCLUDING HEALING AND CRAFTING ITEMS weigh stuff. You have to play the "pick and choose" game with EVERYTHING, and it's tedious and frustrating.
[2:21:57] <Lutre> jermaNosewipe jermaNosewipe jermaNosewipe
[2:21:57] <%jiin6> i refuse my Busted knees
[2:21:58] <%honeyman18> Get the speed walk perk and be 5% slower for no benefit.
[2:22:04] <%ThatOneGameTester> Buuut Paaat, that's all they ever wanted!
[2:22:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> Any of the -phobic flaws are safe choices.
[2:22:08] <%RyanTheRecluse> Besides the perks in this game are pretty crap
[2:22:10] <privatesargent> taking away dodges i could do, but lower speed by 30%, fuck that
[2:22:19] <+Bluemanzee> Ship sux
[2:22:27] <Frog_of_Justic> Image doing the WHOLE GAME a 1/3 slower. FUCK THAT NOISE
[2:22:30] <%Animorphimagi> well it's 70+ years old....
[2:22:31] <+MetroidPrimeRib> some perks are extremely good then the rest are crap
[2:22:41] <%ape_hawk> by the way guys, flaws actually unlock different dialog and events sometimes
[2:22:44] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight I get that. I also think that encumbrance is a useful mechanic though. Forces people to pick what's useful rather than walk with the world in their backpack. Being inconsistent is fine since it's just a game with mechanics revolving around balancing what you can do.
[2:22:48] <LodiFrostbeard> @rumtumtugnutz except robotphobia, fucks you up if you use SAM
[2:22:48] <Dakuu75> @Frog_of_Justic yeah, what are we? in a Sonic under-water level
[2:22:51] <%jiin6> That flaw would Really Suck, if you had a melee build
[2:23:11] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 so i took the diplomatic approach with the squatters you killed. they're a bunch of high guys, doing whip-its on exhaust fumes, debating whether pizza is real, and trying to name their pet robot. you monster. also: the head guy got his lighter from the head security lady, cause he really liked how she kicked his ass a few years back. the strident to her samus
[2:23:14] <lotharrio> Imagine stealth-crawling at 1/3 the speed. Imagine overencumbered walking at 1/3 the speed.
[2:23:16] <Gruhunchously> Does Supernova mode not allow you to reject flaws?
[2:23:21] <+TOONFOOD> @ape_hawk ooh i didn't know that.
[2:23:30] <+MetroidPrimeRib> u can reject them
[2:23:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> @LodiFrostbeard I don't like using SAM anyway, makes things too easy. Even so, if I do use him the drawbacks aren;t necessarily a dealbreaker.
[2:23:33] <%dabeaminator> @RubberFistFight crafting components are weightless, I have like 200 of each part type. Mods have weight, but most of the ones you get are duplicates so they take up very little weight when you're selective. As for healing items. just carry the important ones. It really doesn't take that much time.
[2:23:39] <+babrukus> Kirby he found that all out before killing them lel
[2:23:39] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[2:23:40] <+Grayhammatter> shocker
[2:23:46] <fearhurst> there's a phobia for the enemies on a specific asteroid that I'm almost sure doesnt show up anywhere else
[2:23:52] <transporterthesequel> And shoot them with a giant electric rail cannon yes
[2:23:55] <Calamity2007> @rumtumtugnutz I just don't like using him because I'd rather have the comments from the other characters
[2:23:56] <privatesargent> somes flaws are good and funny, like i got a flaw that lowers stats against robots, now i have a dialogue option with robots to go AAAAAAHHHHHHH
[2:24:05] <%ssjklyco> You're talking like Pops now
[2:24:05] <%Ranryu692> because the gay
[2:24:07] <@commanderclaw> For attention
[2:24:11] <%wsintai> @Kirby_Sauce Yeah he solved the problem non violently, then wanted to steal ALL their stuff so he started blasting
[2:24:12] <Gruhunchously> Now that's a flaw!
[2:24:12] <%tizz86> bc you're an asshole
[2:24:14] <+StrifeZubia> Talk no good
[2:24:14] <%RubberFistFight> @dabeaminator that's great. I still find the system tedious and frustrating and dislike it as a result. Always have, always will. You're totally fine to continue being OK with it, because THAT'S not the part I have a problem with.
[2:24:15] <%dalmek> I don't think your brain needs that blood tbh
[2:24:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> You have a brain?!
[2:24:18] <Dakuu75> face palms.
[2:24:18] <+gruff_gridof> yeah sure thats it
[2:24:19] <Thalchampz> LUL
[2:24:19] <Gruhunchously> Penis is too big
[2:24:21] <SchroedingersFerret> Don't use "sneak" as a noun. I'm getting Omikron flashbacks.
[2:24:24] <%ryome> Does Paige have to suck out the blood?
[2:24:24] <@lewdskeletor13> The moon hat is affecting your mind
[2:24:25] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[2:24:26] <The_Blumper> why is everyone whereing moon heads?
[2:24:29] <%wsintai> @Kirby_Sauce He kind of has a problem
[2:24:30] <%jiin6> there is use of brain?
[2:24:31] <The_Blumper> wearing
[2:24:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Calamity2007 That too. There's so much personality that the big damage tradeoff isn;t really worth it.
[2:24:32] <%honeyman18> Eww, you're hard?
[2:24:38] <%ryome> MOOOOON GanG
[2:24:39] <%Dylveryn> @The_Blumper MOON GANG
[2:24:40] <%Kirby_Sauce> @wsintai wtf
[2:24:42] <%jiin6> ALERT
[2:24:47] <%Ataraxis9> is this the same view pat had in real life?
[2:24:50] <%JonesMcFly> MOON WANG!\
[2:24:54] <Gruhunchously> Sneaking makes his peepee go hard, yes.
[2:24:59] <derap41> +
[2:25:00] <%jiin6> Drop kick is awsome
[2:25:00] <Dakuu75> DROP KICK THAT DRONE lol
[2:25:02] <Calamity2007> Has anyone here done a Supernova playthrough?
[2:25:04] <%wsintai> @Ataraxis9 Its a bit higher than it is IRL, but close
[2:25:12] <derap41> Felix is like a kid going "look at me Dad!2
[2:25:14] <%linSP> does anyone else think perks are super underwhelming over how godawful most flaws are
[2:25:14] <+MetroidPrimeRib> I did supernova
[2:25:15] <%nicos143> drop kicking a flying robot is new kind of badass
[2:25:18] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Goon Mang
[2:25:19] <%Rumbutt> She's not putting that one back together oroLUL
[2:25:20] <+MetroidPrimeRib> it's awful dont do it
[2:25:26] <%ryome> Goon Mang!
[2:25:32] <Calamity2007> @MetroidPrimeRib But muh trophy
[2:25:34] <%JonesMcFly> MOON WANG! MOON WANG! MOON WANG!
[2:25:37] <%Ataraxis9> @wsintai understood
[2:25:48] <+MetroidPrimeRib> if you're gonna just speedrun it with max stealth and dialogue
[2:25:50] <Dakuu75> legs at risk.
[2:25:55] <%jiin6> Supernova has companion permadeath
[2:25:57] <trueherobappo> @AngriestPat I really hope Compulsive Liar is a flaw that you actually end up taking.
[2:25:58] <%tizz86> damn these stubs
[2:25:58] <%sectorquack> when are moon gang shirts comi g
[2:25:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> to be fair it's circuts are fused sho she would have to rebuild it all anyway
[2:25:59] <%dabeaminator> Flaws might be tempting once you hit the level cap and can't get perks any other way, but even then... I really doubt it.
[2:26:02] <+MetroidPrimeRib> and murder the two people on monarch to skip it
[2:26:04] <Dakuu75> LOL
[2:26:06] <%RubberFistFight> @jiin6 I got a perk for taking 25% more plasma damage. Barely noticed the negative, was able to use the perk to get a positive I was still a level and half away from getting "organically". So it's not always a raw deal.
[2:26:10] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight I don't think anyone is saying you have a problem with what they like. We're mostly talking about the mechanics to give you our input, and see if you would change your mind if you thought about it differently.
[2:26:14] <+MetroidPrimeRib> companions cannot be used on supernova you see how fast they die on hard
[2:26:19] <@commanderclaw> Five bullets, totally worth it
[2:26:23] <%Kirby_Sauce> i ended up with the robo-phobia one
[2:26:26] <+MetroidPrimeRib> in exchange get the solo perks
[2:26:41] <$Kotokaname> Cheer100 will you do the 30% decrease eventually ?
[2:26:42] <lotharrio> My guy is afraid of dogs and apes.
[2:26:42] <@commanderclaw> Robo Phobia is rad, gives you new dialogues for talking to robots
[2:26:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> I still argue, all of the -phobia flaws are pretty worth it.
[2:26:55] <%Kirby_Sauce> oh
[2:26:58] <%sectorquack> i got the drug addict one it's really good for stealth but god awful everywhere else
[2:27:03] <%Kirby_Sauce> THAT's why that's ther
[2:27:11] <+MetroidPrimeRib> I think the only flaws worth it are the +25% damage taken from an element
[2:27:15] <Calamity2007> The flaws I took were mostly the elemental weaknesses
[2:27:21] <+MetroidPrimeRib> especially n Ray's which barely exist
[2:27:21] <%jiin6> Supernova has a few extra flaws as well
[2:27:22] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger which is part of why I was trying to elaborate on what specifically about it I disliked, to kinda illustrate that I HAVE thought about it, a lot. I'm 36. I've been playing video games since fucking command-line DOS and Paperboy on the C64. I've had PLENTY OF TIME to come to the conclusions I have.
[2:27:22] <%Kirby_Sauce> whenever i see a robot, i get the option to screm
[2:27:32] <%Kirby_Sauce> including the off one in the ship
[2:27:34] <%dabeaminator> The only phobia I've been offered was for Canids, and I doubt I'll be doing dialogue trees with them.
[2:27:44] <Dakuu75> legs at risk
[2:27:52] <+MetroidPrimeRib> flaws are all based on taking dmg from something
[2:27:55] <%jiin6> Knees are glass
[2:27:56] <%Animorphimagi> @RubberFistFight to be fair, it's hard to tell how many enemies will have plasma weapons down the line(ends up being too few to care about...)
[2:27:57] <%tizz86> not the stubs
[2:27:59] <%Kataguro> My guy is afraid of heights and that's like it
[2:28:06] <Gruhunchously> Elevator conversations
[2:28:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> If you get caught robbing people a few times then you can catch Paranoia.
[2:28:11] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight A'ight.
[2:28:11] <+MetroidPrimeRib> if theres one for primal might as well take it
[2:28:17] <+MetroidPrimeRib> theres like no primal in the game
[2:28:18] <lotharrio> Pat, "I don't want to ruin my knees." Also Pat, "Better take a two story drop right into my knees."
[2:28:21] <+blitzrush1200> The quiet game
[2:28:21] <Calamity2007> A flaw I regretted taking on my playthrough was Permanent Concussion
[2:28:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> That is a Bad Flaw.
[2:28:23] <Heyestus> Is there a perk you can take that your shins don't splinter every time you drop more than 4 feet?
[2:28:31] <+MetroidPrimeRib> I regret taking food addiction
[2:28:32] <%tizz86> stfu biatch
[2:28:41] <%windsoc> @Kirby_Sauce is that why i had the option to just scream at SAM??
[2:28:42] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat Is that what happened to you IRL?
[2:28:42] <%jiin6> Concussion is a terrible Debuff
[2:28:48] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> MUCK IN HER GUTS MORE
[2:28:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat picked the Short flaw during his life playthrough.
[2:28:57] <+MetroidPrimeRib> btw on supernova concussion is permanent til u sleep on your ship
[2:28:59] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger also sorry if that came across as blunt. I wasn't trying to be rude, just making myself clear. I respect your position and I'm grateful for your willingness to actually discuss it versus just going "you're wrong and dumb".
[2:29:00] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Dat Gurl Durrdah
[2:29:01] <%honeyman18> Food addiction? What's the worst flaw?
[2:29:08] <%dabeaminator> @King_Wolf_Rigger RubberFistFight has 300 confirmed kills. JK of course, I get it Rubber. We aren't saying you're wrong, we're just defending OUR opinions just like you're defending yours.
[2:29:10] <+MetroidPrimeRib> also you cant sleep on your ship til ur done with edgewater lmao
[2:29:12] <Dakuu75> oh, so Pat just fixed the AC
[2:29:19] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @rumtumtugnutz Is that a flaw? It got him Paige after all.
[2:29:20] <%Kirby_Sauce> @windsoc yeah, tha'ts what i was talking about
[2:29:34] <%Kirby_Sauce> wait, did pat introduce parvati
[2:29:36] <%RubberFistFight> @dabeaminator I know, which is why I haven't gotten rude :P
[2:29:40] <%jobbedbone> thats dumb
[2:29:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> @King_Wolf_Rigger Well when you take a flaw you get a perk, so
[2:29:40] <%windsoc> @Kirby_Sauce LUL what a good game
[2:29:49] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight Yeah man, no worries. I get you.
[2:29:50] <%jiin6> @Kirby_Sauce yes
[2:30:01] <%Kirby_Sauce> are we helping her get some?
[2:30:05] <Dakuu75> THERE WAS ONE?!
[2:30:05] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @rumtumtugnutz Oooh, dang. You're right.
[2:30:11] <+blitzrush1200> Lesbian...
[2:30:11] <%dabeaminator> NANNER SPANK?
[2:30:12] <%SvenHolgersson> WHERES YOUR HOT SISTER GWEN
[2:30:14] <Calamity2007> Kappa
[2:30:16] <%tizz86> touched a nerve
[2:30:17] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Nanner...Spank?
[2:30:18] <Zombrocom> Woah, did a chat debate have a reasonable and amicable ending? This aint the twitch chat I know
[2:30:19] <%jiin6> in the middle of it yes @Kirby_Sauce
[2:30:20] <%ThatOneGameTester> GELDED? Why that choice of words WutFace
[2:30:27] <%RubberFistFight> I took a "drug addict" flaw because it said it was a -1 on stats, completely misread what that ACTUALLY meant, and only realise WAAAAYYY later, after the point I could feasibly reload the save.
[2:30:29] <derap41> This girl won't breed
[2:30:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> Nanner Spank is a soft drink and a euphemism for a hand job.
[2:30:36] <Monkeyweed21> Have gay Yuri babies with Parvati
[2:30:36] <%RubberFistFight> I really regret that flaw :(
[2:30:45] <Dakuu75> bits and patreon donations lol
[2:30:48] <+MetroidPrimeRib> the addict flaws require you to be a junkie every 10 minutes it's terrible
[2:30:48] <%ChaosAethr> Ellen Paige?
[2:30:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ThatOneGameTester because it is a subtle threat
[2:31:04] <%dabeaminator> He stuck
[2:31:06] <%mortalitas87> apatGib

[2:31:36] <%RubberFistFight> @Zombrocom contrary to what I'm sure lots of people will try and tell you, I'm not that much of an asshole really and would prefer to end disagreements amicably and with an air of mutual respect.
[2:31:40] <%dabeaminator> @ForeverDarkness Dude, the Twitch Mobile app is absolute garbage. I feel you.

[2:31:43] <darcfowler1995> don't hit the eyes on the inside
[2:31:46] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight It really feels like they could explain what it's reducing a little more lol. Pat took Concussed, and holy shit, Il thought it was -1 to a few skills but NOPE.

[2:32:27] <%MrChap23> MrChap23 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! I tune in and I'm immediately greeted with big elmo energy and skeleton problems
[2:32:28] <DrFacilier> intentional
[2:32:40] <%arancet> skeletons are naked, so arent all skeletons skeleton pornography?
[2:32:42] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat so you accidentally put more BONErs on her phone? Kappa
[2:32:49] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight I wonder how many flaws you can take, and still come out on top.
[2:32:51] <CrypticMochi> Skeletons drenched in marrow
[2:32:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> Skeleton Dick Energy?
[2:32:54] <%dabeaminator> @King_Wolf_Rigger It's the classic term division of Attributes and Skills from D&D, so it doesn't really confuse me, but I can see how it could screw up some people who don't have that experience.
[2:32:57] <%dekkitout> She wants a friggin revolution, this one DansGame
[2:33:03] <camelwizard> Did we awaken SAM yet?

[2:33:20] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger you could probably min-max the shit out of it. I bet someone's already got a spreadsheet for it.
[2:33:21] <OldManJEWc> Im guessing weapon choice Isn't a big deal on this game,huh? Like uniques don't have better stats?
[2:33:21] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> i like this quest
[2:33:22] <%Valdorick> apatDab
[2:33:26] <+ForeverDarkness> The app is nice because it maintains better quality than my laptop but that's it

[2:33:36] <+Maleicus> pitta deen dew
[2:33:56] <%RubberFistFight> SO INSTALL A FUCKING REPEATER IN ORBIT YOU DIPSHITS
[2:34:03] <Dakuu75> this sounds like The Purge is about to fucking happen
[2:34:07] <+CanonHusbando> this is the repeater
[2:34:10] <%arancet> you know Jay, this reminds me of an episode of star trek
[2:34:16] <%dabeaminator> @OldManJEWc Named weapons have better stats than other weapons of their level, but you usually find higher level things pretty quickly.
[2:34:19] <%jiin6> REPEATER MACHINE BROKE
[2:34:31] <%RubberFistFight> @arancet <thousand yard stare intensifies>
[2:34:35] <tigerfang86> THATS RIGHT JAY
[2:34:38] <%SvenHolgersson> Thats right Susan
[2:34:38] <Gruhunchously> *Jay looks dead inside*
[2:34:42] <DrFacilier> ^
[2:34:46] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @dabeaminator Oh I know, I've been playing since AD&D, but sometimes I just read it too fast, and it feels like the specific things it talks about aren't actually the stats. Like, it's not "-1 to STR and DEX, +2 to Will saves vs Fear" you know?
[2:35:06] <%WhereIsWill> love that Pat's fan base consists of a lot of RLM fans it's the best
[2:35:12] <dukenux> I wish there was a ST Holiday, so I COULD TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME!!
[2:35:21] <Dakuu75> earth has imploded, this is our final message.
[2:35:23] <+CanonHusbando> well pat IS basically plinket
[2:35:24] <%pectusumbra> not anymore BOIVAN
[2:35:24] <Sapphire_Breeze> "Aliens invaded"
[2:35:25] <%jiin6> EARTH Sucks
[2:35:25] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat Earth's gravity is just weighing down your souls
[2:35:27] <%ThatOneGameTester> jesus, planet/galaxy level classism
[2:35:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> *Earth is not important.
[2:35:28] <%marsanta> Not so important when it's forever away
[2:35:29] <tigerfang86> Earth's alright
[2:35:30] <%Ner234> I wonder what Earth is like at this point?
[2:35:33] <%walternatorz> Earth's the center of the galaxy
[2:35:37] <BlindGato> I can't wait for the message saying Earth's DEAD
[2:35:37] <%dalmek> nah Earth's just a place to get money from
[2:35:37] <tigerfang86> Earth is where THE MOON GANG originated from
[2:35:39] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger yeah, like a -1 to a MODIFIER versus -1 to the core stat amount. Depending on what the stat is, that could either have no effect at all, or hugely gimp you.
[2:35:39] <%CappuccinoGuil> How many botched missions does Pat have?
[2:35:41] <tigerfang86> so how can it be that bad
[2:35:42] <OldManJEWc> I see. So you could be fine tinkering with any weapon then?
[2:35:44] <%Rumbutt> Pat, if the rest of the setting is anything to go by, I bet Earth is not very cool
[2:35:44] <%Animorphimagi> is it tho?
[2:35:44] <dukenux> Pat is a son of Mr. Plinkett and Rich Evans
[2:35:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight I bet, but I mean, what if you kept taking the flaws lol. Just, Drug user, Concussion, etc. Could you keep going?
[2:35:49] <%dekkitout> "Erth #1, spaserz r lame"
[2:35:55] <%pectusumbra> Alright, I'm passing out, I'll watch the rest of this tomorrow, good night all.

[2:38:24] <%jiin6> Pat is a Square
[2:38:25] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, your sentence implies you do drugs IRL
[2:38:25] <derap41> Drugs in this game suck anyways
[2:38:26] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat your heal is literally a temporary buff via an inhaler though dude Kappa

[2:38:37] <%jiin6> Moon Gang do ALL THE DRUGS
[2:38:37] <dukenux> But you drink Red Bull
[2:38:41] <Lutre> drugs are temporary buffs irl
[2:38:41] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[2:38:43] <Gruhunchously> @dukenux Um...I think so, yeah.

[2:38:47] <%SvenHolgersson> PERMABONER
[2:38:47] <%TaifuDragon> wait that's a startling implication
[2:38:49] <Dakuu75> can't handle Pat and Paige conversations.
[2:38:51] <DrFacilier> temporary number go ups are a no
[2:38:54] <+PenmanLupine> yeah if you last that long
[2:38:54] <Lutre> schlong splint
[2:38:57] <%foreverN2dust> @dukenux constantly, it's not temporary that way
[2:38:58] <%DriedLeafJuice> But life is a temporary buff Pat
[2:38:58] <%Animorphimagi> Red Bull is pretty much drugs
[2:38:58] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight Speaking of Space Ozzy, I've actually been getting more and more into psychedelic rock and doom metal. They got some good tunes.
[2:39:02] <%ThatOneGameTester> he would jjust get the pump attachment paige, be real
[2:39:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> YOU'RE real pretty, Felix
[2:39:05] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat would that mean you would do 'temporary buffs' if you had enough to effectively make it permanent

[2:43:32] <%MelBrooksKA> Because he said so!
[2:43:35] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat save before you fuck it up
[2:43:35] <Monkeyweed21> No both
[2:43:36] <derap41> no tinkering at all
[2:43:36] <%Piemen99> Emote only time
[2:43:39] <@commanderclaw> Those are different things
[2:43:40] <MrDante7> @AngriestPat the science skill lowers the cost of tinkering all weapons
[2:43:40] <%Piemen99> let's go
[2:43:43] <derap41> chekc the sciene skill sperks
[2:43:46] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Literally one guy
[2:43:47] <+MisterRockett> Pat give the Shrink Ray to a party member
[2:43:49] <%TaifuDragon> the level 100 skill for science makes tinkering cheap
[2:43:50] <%linSP> you can tinker until up to five above your level but the cost doubles each time
[2:43:51] <+babrukus> yeah those are two different things my dude
[2:43:51] <%honeyman18> late science skill caps science weapon costs
[2:43:54] <rosemon5001> then do it
[2:43:54] <@lewdskeletor13> You should put points into science if you want to tinker, it makes it cheaper
[2:43:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> Chat, does tinkering have a cap?
[2:43:57] <Dakuu75> Stonks
[2:43:59] <deviljhojho_> hmmm
[2:43:59] <Mrbaconator> science caps science weapon ttinkering at 80
[2:44:02] <+CanonHusbando> lvl 100 science is a 90% discount
[2:44:06] <dukenux> Its nice you can mode uniques. shame you could only do like a couple in NV
[2:44:06] <%dabeaminator> What's worse, Pat taking two steams to finish the Groundbreaker or Paige spending one stream to finish the first room of Heide's Tower?
[2:44:07] <+ForeverDarkness> @angriestpat don't forget to tinker and mod companion equipment
[2:44:07] <%ClericOfSparda> SAVE! SCUM! apatDab
[2:44:08] <$Blackgaver> never upgrade pat just make fun of people until you reach level 100..
[2:44:11] <Monkeyweed21> Cheaper in the long run to tinker after levelling science
[2:44:13] <fightstickmagi> Is Supernova any fun? anyone tried it?
[2:44:15] <dukenux> Z A P
[2:44:25] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> science skill lowers tinker cost
[2:44:28] <derap41> it will cost 500 000 bits to level one level late game which is impossible if you tinker with them now
[2:44:28] <%Niney_Who> Level Sex
[2:44:28] <TeepPhoenix> Level Sex?
[2:44:34] <%linSP> supernova isnt fun when you lose progress
[2:44:35] <+Double_Tap_That> @fightstickmagi No
[2:44:36] <+Punchasaur> level cap is 30 btw
[2:44:40] <%Animorphimagi> level sax
[2:44:46] <derap41> Doin't until you have 100 science
[2:44:46] <Mrbaconator> OH I see what he is saying he's saying tinker it AFTER leveling science @AngriestPat
[2:44:47] <dukenux> I played NV on hardcore, but i don't feel like playing this on Supernova
[2:44:55] <deviljhojho_> hmmmm
[2:44:57] <@commanderclaw> Oh, leveling science makes it cheaper
[2:45:01] <Sapphire_Breeze> @fightstickmagi I like it a lot, started super painful but later it got better
[2:45:03] <+CanonHusbando> supernova is basically like any other difficulty only with save and fast travel restrictions
[2:45:04] <Dakuu75> this sounds like... a mute arguement
[2:45:05] <Mrbaconator> @AngriestPat it ramps up hard
[2:45:06] <derap41> They go up super fast
[2:45:07] <+Sinetha> number go up NOW
[2:45:10] <%Animorphimagi> drong now
[2:45:14] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> but what if they costed 49?
[2:45:16] <Monkeyweed21> Delay big number now to get Bigger number later
[2:45:18] <dukenux> Does supernova work like hc in NV, or is it a completely separate difficulty level?
[2:45:20] <%Kirby_Sauce> you have 9000 bits
[2:45:21] <fightstickmagi> I like the idea of it accept for the save restrictions
[2:45:22] <TeepPhoenix> Has anyone done the Nier Raid in FF14 yet?
[2:45:22] <Retinolgaming> Everytime you tinker number go up big time.
[2:45:22] <Mr_Strut> So get 80
[2:45:24] <%ThatOneGameTester> is there a limited number of bits?
[2:45:26] <%dekkitout> Big number now? Or cheap BIGGER number later?
[2:45:26] <%Kirby_Sauce> just buy iy
[2:45:26] <%Niney_Who> -90% LUL
[2:45:29] <Sol_Install> just respec
[2:45:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Tinker now, when prices get steep, then hold off. What's so hard about this chat?
[2:45:32] <dukenux> time to sutdy, nerdf
[2:45:33] <deviljhojho_> 100
[2:45:34] <derap41> If you tinker with something now and then get 80 that bonus won't apply to your already tinkered weapon
[2:45:35] <%ryome> Why is chat a bunch of bitches?
[2:45:36] <privatesargent> and we can always just, replace the lower level weapons
[2:45:37] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> respec
[2:45:41] <Mrbaconator> @AngriestPat the costt ramps up SUPER HARD
[2:45:43] <+blitzrush1200> It's dirt cheap and he's going to replace them with the upgraded version
[2:45:43] <%honeyman18> There is tier 2 and 3 versions of all guns, just change later but tinker now
[2:45:44] <%dabeaminator> @AngriestPat You'll be using completely different weapons by then, it doesn't matter. Get a bigger number now and get new guns later on.
[2:45:44] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat dump some into perception
[2:45:48] <+CanonHusbando> youre one hitting everything so upgrading is kinda pointless
[2:45:52] <%Niney_Who> 3
[2:46:04] <OToole42> ignore chat, just enjoy game
[2:46:07] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Its a temporary buff if you sell those weapons later
[2:46:10] <deviljhojho_> look thinkering doesnt do much anyways
[2:46:13] <TeepPhoenix> AHHHHHH
[2:46:15] <Dakuu75> ppl in chat being crazy, then ONE voice of reason speaks up lol
[2:46:17] <deviljhojho_> better save those bits

[2:52:44] <%RubberFistFight> man, I HATE "violence is never the option". Sometimes it's the ONLY option. And whilst that's regrettable, it's MORE regrettable to wind up hurt or dead because you wouldn't fight back.

[2:53:53] <%honeyman18> Soap probably comes from the soap homunculus here.

[2:58:47] <startstoprepeat> this is like the fourth time i've heard this conversation
[2:58:51] <%dabeaminator> I recommend the movement perk. It doesn't seem super worth it at a glance, but it hurts seeing you move around without it after I've had it for a while. It constantly looks like you're encumbered.
[2:58:53] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> See, Pathfinder has Perception as a skill, not a stat. I always get thrown for a loop concerning that.

[3:08:39] <%ssjklyco> With pat and woolie, it would just be pat rubbing his knees and forhead

[3:11:18] <%RubberFistFight> @MetroidPrimeRib I don't think Woolie would still be friends with Pat if he wasn't ok with that particular dynamic though. You can be frustrated with/annoyed by your friends without deciding to not be friends with them anymore. Nobody ever sees 100% eye to eye.

[3:29:41] <%CrabSlacks> so the guy just hates the way you talk in general?

[3:29:53] <%sl8r4l8r> @Nordguy i spell everything bad so sorry
[3:29:55] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Your mouth noises aren't NEARLY as ear raping as FarFromSubtle eating his 'snacky bars'
[3:30:04] <Bogart4321> awesome drop kick :O
[3:30:08] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I like dog dropkicks
[3:30:08] <%honeyman18> Skills teleport too much

[3:30:20] <Dakuu75> PARTY IS DOWN
[3:30:22] <+Ominnous> I think that dropkick just slid off a dog 1 foot off the ground
[3:30:34] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Because I just got here from an RE4 stream: Can you suplex or roundhouse kick enemies in this game?
[3:30:36] <%Falcnuts> Falcnuts subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:30:51] <+Punchasaur> look at this gamer
[3:31:03] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @TyrianPurpleHaze One of your NPC followers can dropkick.
[3:31:05] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> that gun solves robots
[3:31:06] <%Nordguy> @sl8r4l8r were both cool its ok
[3:31:08] <LodiFrostbeard> @TyrianPurpleHaze no and no, one of your companions can do a sick drop kick tho
[3:31:14] <TechDragon_Z> Hah suck it robot
[3:31:16] <%RubberFistFight> @PlainSimpleTailor honestly I've had people get annoyed at my videos because I, and I quote, "breathe too loud" (I don't because I don't mouthbreathe). Some people take the "misophonia" (which isn't even a formal diagnosis) thing way too far.
[3:31:34] <%MelBrooksKA> no
[3:31:38] <%Piemen99> where's the discord link?
[3:31:39] <trueherobappo> @AngriestPat Have you not given them any armor?
[3:31:40] <+gambit_gamble> no
[3:31:41] <Bogart4321> nothing wrong with getting a case of fukass
[3:31:44] <Ultimatefool> Maybe they would have lived if they weren't MOON MEN
[3:31:44] <TyrianPurpleHaze> I know what you're saying, I just wish I didn't.
[3:31:49] <grayjammer> No

[3:32:07] <Ion_Laser> ...
[3:32:10] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @RubberFistFight Problem is, he uses lapel mics instead of a stationary with a pop filter
[3:32:11] <%sl8r4l8r> @Nordguy Yeah, I's all good.
[3:32:16] <%CrabSlacks> the moon masks are armor
[3:32:18] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Their armour is trash, and needs levels
[3:32:24] <+nekodelic> they're wearing default
[3:32:27] <%dabeaminator> They are Moon Gang, and that is all that matters,
[3:32:31] <+Finch_9001> Have you considered turning the difficulty back up now that you’re geared?

[3:33:26] <+Arkfyre> only if he does the alphys voice
[3:33:30] <%takiyami> Answer the question Pat
[3:33:31] <@commanderclaw> Oh god, anything but Pat's Alphys voice
[3:33:33] <%Kirby_Sauce> ANSWER HER PAT
[3:33:34] <morningmoondude> do it
[3:33:34] <%RubberFistFight> @PlainSimpleTailor oh sorry I meant specific to Pat. If you're eating horrible sticky candy bars and the microphone is right there? Then yes, it can be a bit offputting. My comment was aimed more at people who lose their fucking minds at the SLIGHTEST amount of mouthnoise. They're giant hypocrites as well, since everyone's mouths are noisy to some degree.
[3:33:35] <%Valdorick> Just shit in your storage locker
[3:33:43] <rosemon5001> he would be perfect @commanderclaw
[3:33:48] <morningmoondude> cosplay as the yuri ship you coward

[4:10:04] <eco419> Out of context
[4:10:07] <+Yukasmarvin> Paige, how could you? I have not been so disgusted in years! And the last time was the mosterd thing!
[4:10:08] <%dekkitout> Oh, Roooooooooon
[4:10:10] <FriskyBird> You dip the damn oreo in the milk BEFORE you eat it, Pat.
[4:10:11] <graemecrackers1> Paige is a roit
[4:10:11] <Dakuu75> @RubberFistFight she jsut buys the actual soda-syrup for comercial machines.
[4:10:16] <DefaultSettiings> every night when you're sleeping, Elmo punches you in the face several times
[4:10:16] <+TOONFOOD> that is not proper dunk etiquette

[4:10:47] <+CanonHusbando> its a cookie
[4:10:48] <LANkr> what
[4:10:48] <redrins> dry oreos are good
[4:10:50] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Dry oreos are superior, especially if manually double stuffed
[4:10:50] <Ion_Laser> ?
[4:10:52] <LANkr> damn
[4:10:52] <+blitzrush1200> So like a normal person?
[4:10:53] <%DriedLeafJuice> Paige.
[4:10:53] <SpaceGuntank> it needs to ABSORB the milk flavor
[4:10:53] <%dekkitout> Pat likes it dry I guess...
[4:10:53] <FriskyBird> Dunk it in the room temperature soda
[4:10:54] <Mornaka> 1
[4:10:54] <%Ner234> Dry Oreos are fine
[4:10:56] <cassiecagedd> Paige likes it wet
[4:10:56] <+Punchasaur> why would you want a milkshake warm...
[4:10:56] <%dabeaminator> Then you get Oreo mush at the bottom of the cup@
[4:10:57] <%penguinsarefly> PAIGE IS RIGHT FOR ONCE
[4:10:58] <Lutre> dunkiquette
[4:11:00] <%merylinspants> That's the American Way
[4:11:00] <eco419> Paige is fine
[4:11:00] <%marsanta> 2
[4:11:02] <%RubberFistFight> @Dakuu75 jokes aside, I wish I could find a source for that shit because me and the missus have a SodaStream. It's probably best that I can't, though, otherwise I'd put back on the 20kg I've lost and then some.
[4:11:03] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> such class
[4:11:04] <Edible_Enthusiasm> paige plz

[4:11:06] <CrypticMochi> Paige you fucking drink mustard
[4:11:06] <%dekkitout> Phrasing
[4:11:06] <osiris1260> you mean like someone who's not a freak?

[4:11:09] <beetbo2> WutFace
[4:11:10] <+AntithesisEK> the absolute ghoul mode of this paige
[4:11:13] <+Yukasmarvin> So classy!
[4:11:15] <rubbishbinge> Then you may as well treat oreos as cereal
[4:11:15] <%GalacticaPhanto> WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace
[4:11:15] <ミュウレ4242> oreos and rootbeer is the only way to gorge.
[4:11:22] <Mornaka> 15 SECONDS IS THE OPTIMAL OREO DUNK TIME
[4:11:24] <TomFrank> the classy way is putting the oreo on a fork
[4:11:25] <+CanonHusbando> fuck the lactose intollerant i guess
[4:11:27] <%RupanSen> I don't even like Oreos that much
[4:11:29] <NeroInfinite> I mean there IS ore cereal
[4:11:29] <SummonerMagno> I eat dry oreos. I hate milk
[4:11:30] <%penguinsarefly> This is the one food opinion that Paige isn't completely wrong about
[4:11:32] <eco419> OREO WAR
[4:11:33] <%gespenst25> PAIGE IT'S A COOKIE YOU CAN'T EVEN EAT A BURGER

[4:11:45] <kpokey> You can eat them dry, you just have to take an immediate swing of milk, a mouth dunk if you will
[4:11:45] <televisedrevolting> @canonhusbando Dunk it in water
[4:11:45] <DefaultSettiings> eat the milk, drink the oreos
[4:11:47] <+Punchasaur> PAIGE IS OREO HITLER

[4:11:50] <+Seyyen> PAT HOLD THE TRIGGER ON THE PLASMA RIFLE YOU BUTTHOLE
[4:11:51] <%RubberFistFight> Yeah Paige I'm forced to remind you of that time you dared Dick Masterson to a mustard chug on stage, and you DRAINED THE FUCKING BOTTLE without blinking.

[4:11:57] <%MelBrooksKA> FUCKING RAD!
[4:11:59] <%dabeaminator> @AngriestPat game volume is a little high now for some reason
[4:12:01] <%GalacticaPhanto> I mean I dunk oreos in almond and soy milk and they taste good sort of
