[0:11:25] <%Verd_254> @vanillaicyjojo it came after 7
[0:11:27] <+Ell1ot> i'm sad that Triple Triad isn't being ported to the switch
[0:11:27] <TheMilhouseExperience> No 8 and thank god none of the 13 trilogy

[0:11:34] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> 8 was fine but not great and fuck the spell stocking system.
[0:11:35] <sjcodan> I'M GONNA GO SHOWER, BE BACK BEFORE GAMEPLAY STARTS.
[0:11:35] <+ziggityzaq> Is it not being ported is because of that song that was made for the game? Like is it a license issue?
[0:11:36] <%AbnormalVoid> People like me? Kappa
[0:11:37] <%CerberusDriver> 8 hatred is a meme at this point
[0:11:38] <Ninjagregory98> I expected it to get in before 13
[0:11:39] <pokechuno> Gib thank

[0:12:01] <echodrone81> squall was a loser
[0:12:03] <%AbnormalVoid> and yeah, FFT got shafted apatWhat
[0:12:12] <%PipIV> @masterfire23 I know the feeling from Harvey
[0:12:19] <+TastySammiches> why not just bundle ff7, 8 and 9 together for like 40 bucks
[0:12:19] <%DrDarkhart> No colorblind options doe @AngriestPat
[0:12:23] <eco419> Skelmo is the real reason I‚Äôm here
[0:12:29] <%flagi64> But still no FF7 remake
[0:12:33] <+Walopoh> Has 8 had a single acknowledgement since it's release
[0:12:35] <$Boomyvimty> Can we have a moment of silence for 8?

[0:18:03] <%PipIV> Spiderman, attorney at law
[0:18:04] <reonome> GRINDIN
[0:18:05] <%badchoice5> So I grinded a little bit...
[0:18:11] <Huntercd> I'm gunna tell Paige on you
[0:18:12] <Mr_LupLup> That looks TERRIBLE
[0:18:12] <deviljhojho94> its a bad suit
[0:18:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> big levels
[0:18:13] <devanmuse> "Objective" Vaccinate the fish" What the fuck did I miss in this game??
[0:18:15] <+bread_assassin> It may be one of the first suits you unlock, but I really like the Scarlet Spider Suit
[0:18:16] <%CerberusDriver> MJ is a manipulative bitch in this game, excuse my language. She acts like a dramatic teenager and treats Peter like shit
[0:18:20] <%Sirculbs> "Long story short, I've been grinding offscreen a bit..."
[0:18:20] <$MightyMaxT> It looks cool at night. It glows
[0:18:23] <HoIlywood_SN> its from a bad comic
[0:18:25] <%PipIV> fear itself.....ew
[0:18:25] <$magikestral> from the Fear Itself comic series, obviously
[0:18:25] <+xxviios> @bobodahobo ive seen him open open them past midnight
[0:18:25] <deviljhojho94> its nice
[0:18:26] <+khalcipher> Fear itself
[0:18:27] <%ThatGuyfromMars> oooohhhh fear itself, that wasn't good.
[0:18:28] <sjcodan> "STEALTH"
[0:18:30] <%CerberusDriver> Scarlet Spider suit, do it
[0:18:33] <echodrone81> Spiderman 2 electro?
[0:18:35] <Sinister_Aglet> the black suit has not eye articulation which makes it terrible for cutscenes
[0:18:36] <b1gboss007> electric punches is super op
[0:18:36] <29vigilanthand> Spiderpunk 2077
[0:18:37] <%badchoice5> I think Fear Itself comes from FDR
[0:18:37] <+G_Thunders> It glows in the dark
[0:18:37] <Kavtech> But it's head doesn't animate...
[0:18:38] <%immobilecarrot6> can't you switch out abilities to whatever suit you want?
[0:18:40] <%JaydenSai> @AngriestPat Fear Itself was from a shitty comic
[0:18:40] <circular7> you haven't gotten the white suit yet
[0:18:46] <%SuperCasualBoom> cheer202 A how do you do, Pat? You called it that SNK showcase Samurai Shodown. What do you hope that game will have and won‚Äôt have in it? If Wan-Fu comes back he better have the fucking stone pillar. Such a badass weapon.
[0:18:48] <SainVt> hey pat you watched the nintendo direct?
[0:18:49] <+Walopoh> (BRIGHT NEON GREEN) "STEALTH"
[0:18:52] <pokechuno> Hate the helmet
[0:18:57] <+jayfigga> Spider bro and octo arms are OP
[0:18:58] <+xxviios> Daft Punk Spidey is cool
[0:18:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYEYEYE
[0:19:03] <deviljhojho94> YE
[0:19:03] <federico_with_a_f> The black cat one is super awesome
[0:19:03] <+BlakeLocked> Comes from a bad Guardians event that isn't worth thinking about.
[0:19:04] <Demon_chann> pat
[0:19:05] <god__of__lore> The Black Cat one is dope
[0:19:06] <Brainworm205> I liked the Fear Itself story arc lol
[0:19:08] <iwa5h4ck3d> Solved all the crimes
[0:19:10] <%CerberusDriver> Scarlet Spider is the best suit in this game.
[0:19:11] <Zombrocom> GRINDING OFFSCREEN BABY
[0:19:12] <zal_silverfang> cant wait for MORE COLLECTABLES
[0:19:13] <deviljhojho94> DO BLACK CAT FOR SUIT PogChamp
[0:19:14] <+BlakeLocked> Dumb mirror nonsense.
[0:19:16] <%PipIV> can't wait for the symbiote suit
[0:19:17] <$magikestral> do the last stuff before the next mission
[0:19:18] <%DedlokPM> @SainVt It was literally the 1st thing he talked about on the stream
[0:19:27] <%ThatGuyfromMars> man fast traveling is the best
[0:19:29] <CactusCommando> testing
[0:19:30] <circular7> LUL
[0:19:31] <SainVt> i just arrived...so sorry?
[0:19:37] <%ThatGuyfromMars> just chillin on the subway

[0:19:40] <lloyddboy> SPIDER SLAP
[0:19:41] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat do final black 'cat right now
[0:19:42] <%DrDarkhart> @AngriestPat Quad Damage takes forever to come back and the Blur Projection is absolutely useless as you can only use it while sitting still, cool suit doe.
[0:19:44] <lloyddboy> wait
[0:19:52] <puhff> What series is this suit from?
[0:19:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> So has @AngriestPat discovered the social feed thing yet?
[0:19:57] <deviljhojho94> Final black cato PogChamp
[0:19:58] <+jayfigga> Something happens midway the challenges not just the last one
[0:20:03] <%BoboDaHobo> it seems like a bug
[0:20:05] <CactusCommando> @AngriestPat hey pat, have you seen the ad for the yakuza spinoff where you play as a private detective? it looks rad
[0:20:13] <%skizzuto> maybe it means you could craft new stuff if you wanted, you just haven't yet?
[0:20:15] <god__of__lore> It‚Äôs a bug with the latest patch
[0:20:16] <SatansDick1> @puhff its from when spidey lost his spider sense
[0:20:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> n i g t h
[0:20:20] <%DedlokPM> @SainVt He talked about how "horrible" it is that FF8 got snubbed by squenix. apatWhat
[0:20:22] <+shawntk_> OH THIS IS THE WORST ONE
[0:20:26] <+shawntk_> oh no wait
[0:20:27] <HoIlywood_SN> theres a yakuza detective spinoff
[0:20:31] <%MisterCrimson> @CactusCommando they talked about it on the podcast
[0:20:31] <HoIlywood_SN> whoa
[0:20:32] <%Shuckleberry_Finn> fuck this mission
[0:20:32] <+shawntk_> this isn't what I thought it was
[0:20:34] <%PipIV> @satansdick1 spider island?
[0:20:40] <Psykoknight65> @walopoh i think its a stealth suit because it can turn invisible
[0:20:43] <Demon_chann> WOW
[0:20:43] <%SerMonotonousGaming> i am so lost haha i think i mightve missed some game
[0:20:43] <SainVt> ahh classic pat
[0:20:44] <SatansDick1> yeyeye
[0:20:46] <$ImasukyLomae> cool
[0:20:47] <%DrDarkhart> Oh god this mission was annoying
[0:20:49] <Demon_chann> METAL GEAR OVER HERE
[0:20:50] <xxafrodragonxx> Nic transition.
[0:20:53] <tmo200> You can use blur projector and still move. Its just a bubble that you use so peepz dont see you for a sec b4 you reposition
[0:20:53] <%MelBrooksKA> I haven't been here since the middle of the first spidey stream, how confusing is this gonna be?
[0:20:55] <wired_soul> uh oh
[0:20:55] <dekkitout> tajWUT
[0:20:56] <deviljhojho94> no swinging PogChamp
[0:20:56] <%craig_t> STEALTH SPIDER?
[0:20:57] <%badmr7> why armed drones in a city?
[0:20:57] <HoIlywood_SN> HURT ME MORE
[0:20:59] <kwangalang> WHOOPS
[0:20:59] <BestTeaMaker> WHERE DID THESE DRONES COME FROM
[0:21:00] <+jayfigga> All these missions are annoying lol
[0:21:01] <HoIlywood_SN> HURT ME SNAKE
[0:21:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> batman
[0:21:08] <%CerberusDriver> the 'Black Cat" suit is actually his Mephisto suit from when Deadpool murdered Spidey but felt bad and pulled him out of Hell
[0:21:08] <HoIlywood_SN> I REMEMBER THAT PUNCH
[0:21:08] <$magikestral> oh god this sounds annoying
[0:21:11] <xxafrodragonxx> Nice*
[0:21:13] <+Walopoh> @Psykoknight65 Did not know that but that makes much more sense, thanks
[0:21:16] <vampireinarm> VIDEO GAME
[0:21:16] <%PipIV> "You're that spider?"
[0:21:17] <HoIlywood_SN> THAT KICK
[0:21:27] <AncelDeLambert> did Peter just cause his own problems again?
[0:21:34] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[0:21:37] <HoIlywood_SN> AFTER ZANZIBAR, I WAS TAKEN FROM THE BATTLE
[0:21:38] <deviljhojho94> LUL
[0:21:41] <%skizzuto> this is neat
[0:21:45] <dekkitout> look out sue storm, there's a new invisi-bitch in town!
[0:22:05] <SainVt> that drone was delivering a pizza pat how could you
[0:22:12] <+duskrush> This would be so much easier with all the mobility upgrades
[0:22:13] <HoIlywood_SN> it even sounds like MGS Stealth camo
[0:22:17] <Austin0097> BECAUSE SPIDER-MAN IS A MENACE!
[0:22:17] <%badchoice5> SPIDER-GHOST!
[0:22:18] <zal_silverfang> well it would be broken if it was just straight up invisability. even with a timer
[0:22:18] <%PipIV> is spider-man still a part of the fantastic four?
[0:22:24] <%CerberusDriver> That cloaking noise is from Ratchet and Clank
[0:22:32] <wired_soul> i like this ambient music
[0:22:33] <$magikestral> Spiderman stop taking pleasure from murder
[0:22:44] <%DrDarkhart> My favorite thing is he's like I can't use this because it messes with web gadgets maybe I could fix it. *never fixes it*
[0:22:50] <+Real_Todd_Howard> LUL
[0:23:00] <%CerberusDriver> The cloaking noise is when you access a store or enter your spaceship menu
[0:23:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[0:23:12] <the_sprankton> how does cloaking interfere with webbing?
[0:23:20] <kwangalang> LUL
[0:23:21] <Austin0097> BIG DAMAGE
[0:23:23] <the_sprankton> the gadgets I get, but the basic webs are pretty analog
[0:23:26] <%SerMonotonousGaming> this area looks very arkham city
[0:23:28] <god__of__lore> This one took me forever
[0:23:32] <%TaifuDragon> the web probably breaks the cloak
[0:23:41] <Mattanator4000> @angriestpat ik the gameplay is good, but what of the writing
[0:23:43] <%DrDarkhart> Does Pat not know how to point launch?
[0:23:44] <%badchoice5> Wait guys, Spidey is disappearing and reappearing all over the place. IS HE TELEPORTING!?!?!
[0:23:54] <TheHeroAppears> KILLER QUEEN?
[0:23:55] <+TastySammiches> bites za dasto
[0:23:55] <vampireinarm> BITE ZA DUSTO
[0:23:56] <$Mendin> What? No! He's using the Zapping System
[0:24:01] <$magikestral> oh fuck spidey has a stand
[0:24:15] <vingadivo> IS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING JOJOKE?
[0:24:15] <PakuV2> CLEAN
[0:24:16] <xxafrodragonxx> STAND.
[0:24:17] <%CerberusDriver> SpiderMan's stand [Late Rent]
[0:24:17] <kwangalang> yatta
[0:24:17] <masterfire23> lots did nothing wrong
[0:24:19] <%HyperCharge_Sam> PodChamp
[0:24:19] <god__of__lore> We need Drax up in here, he mastered invisibility
[0:24:20] <%skizzuto> apatDab
[0:24:21] <%CurrySauseBandit> Actually cool end PogChamp
[0:24:23] <deviljhojho94> DABBED ON
[0:24:24] <%HyperCharge_Sam> PogChamp
[0:24:24] <Hidashi13> BITES ZADUSTO
[0:24:24] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> P E R F E C T
[0:24:27] <Demon_chann> If spiderman had a stand what name would it have?
[0:24:28] <wired_soul> the ambient music is gone now
[0:24:29] <Huntercd> You'll never see it coming
[0:24:30] <mercado94> More like a Persona
[0:24:31] <%brentoland> Now you unlocked a new one
[0:24:34] <wired_soul> go back and do it again
[0:24:34] <SainVt> can you crash into a wall and die in this game?
[0:24:35] <%craig_t> wait, can you stealth wherever now?
[0:24:36] <%DedlokPM> @the_sprankton I assume either the virbation or the energy of the energy field based on the fact he said the energy field of the cloak interferes with it
[0:24:40] <dekkitout> "Gunpowder and glycerin! Dynamite with a laser beam!"
[0:24:41] <Mr_LupLup> Those drones might have been usefull when Jason was visiting
[0:24:45] <%Wallabri> haha... the bugs out...
[0:24:46] <%DrDarkhart> @AngriestPat There's another Research Station now
[0:24:47] <%PipIV> [g u i l t t r i p]
[0:24:47] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> does this game have a taunt button ?
[0:24:47] <AncelDeLambert> Why is the biggest corporate interest allowing its CEO to run for Mayor of New York?
[0:24:47] <deviljhojho94> BLACK CAT BLACK CAT PogChamp
[0:24:47] <$MightyMaxT> You.....did it
[0:24:53] <masterfire23> kira is best jojo
[0:24:57] <$Mendin> @AncelDeLambert TRUMP
[0:24:57] <%craig_t> because keeping the stealth up as a abckup for when he doesn't need to web swing should still work fine
[0:24:58] <Tampaoster> perfect
[0:24:58] <AncelDeLambert> Shouldn't the citizens be losing their shit about collusion?
[0:24:59] <fmc009> Please use Stealth/Big Time Suit
[0:25:02] <%CerberusDriver> @AncelDeLambert just like real life!
[0:25:02] <vanillaicyjojo> amazing
[0:25:05] <%badchoice5> "Hmm, I wonder if I could whip up a stealth suit? Maybe in time for Marvel's Spiderman 2!"
[0:25:07] <HoIlywood_SN> reminds me of the unlimited suits ability from the PS1 game
[0:25:08] <+trekkie11041> That foreshadowing
[0:25:09] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[0:25:11] <+Walopoh> Anybody know when the Black Cat DLC comes out?
[0:25:15] <+duskrush> now switch to the big time stealth suit to make it canon
[0:25:16] <+shawntk_> that one only shows up after you do all the others @AngriestPat
[0:25:17] <$magikestral> spidey stayed suspended in midair until morning
[0:25:19] <%CerberusDriver> This game doesn't let you kill cops, Kotaku gives it 3/10
[0:25:21] <mercado94> LUL
[0:25:21] <%DrDarkhart> @AngriestPat It shows up when you finish all the other ones
[0:25:22] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat Do black' cat
[0:25:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> forgetful boi
[0:25:24] <Demon_chann> just do the black cat one pat @AngriestPat
[0:25:26] <vampireinarm> wouldnt it be easier to mod his web shooters so the signal dosent mess with them than to rework the entire invisibility mod
[0:25:28] <god__of__lore> YOU FOOL
[0:25:28] <dadeaner> lightning rod is an interesting one
[0:25:28] <+JenovasPuppet> You haven't done the one without the green arrows
[0:25:30] <+khalcipher> LUL
[0:25:31] <+Gooniekorn> crazy talk

[0:26:01] <+FrostMass22> Spidercide?
[0:26:01] <%MisterCrimson> Spiders are fine, but can he do it as only a Manderville Man can?
[0:26:02] <+Walopoh> @blizzagan cool thanks
[0:26:09] <echodrone81> some lady yells help, swings right on by
[0:26:11] <AncelDeLambert> I'm sure he typically goes AROUND
[0:26:12] <%akuda_bar> Spiderman would hate to live in DC because all the buildings are short
[0:26:15] <vanillaicyjojo> i need this game so badly, why tf do i gotta have no money NotLikeThis
[0:26:19] <+duskrush> He almost said Spidercide
[0:26:19] <cerberuscarmine> only spiders can science
[0:26:21] <%badchoice5> Much like Supergirl, Spiderman's greatest weakness is Nature
[0:26:21] <%PipIV> at least going through the park in this game is better than 2
[0:26:30] <+JenovasPuppet> Put on your focus generating power so you can get health back
[0:26:33] <vingadivo> i have no money and no console fml
[0:26:39] <+TastySammiches> go shoot fingerguns at people
[0:26:41] <Harboldt> yo pat, how far into the story are you? just joined in

[0:31:14] <juhbathehutt> and then aiming while the lightning strikes somewhere else

[0:42:30] <%Agami23> miles can kick the shit out of symbiotes with his venom strike
[0:42:30] <%CerberusDriver> @AngriestPat That suit is actually from the comics. Specifically when Deadpool killed Peter but felt bad so he pulls Peter out of Purgatory and he just has that suit

[1:12:16] <%craig_t> miles gets a lot of hate from people who were way to attached to peter and the status quo in comics (and, a bunch of racists as well), but he was pretty cool
[1:12:17] <%Trekalone> He got experience for whatever happened in the weeklong timeskip
[1:12:19] <Clu_Flynn> shut up MJ

[1:12:24] <thewhiterice92> @Bonkasaurusrex THEY COULD AT LEAST GO ASK WHAT HE WAS DOING AT THE TIME

[1:20:06] <%badchoice5> Am I crazy, or shouldn't Spiderman be able to simply tear off that door, or at least bend the bars?
[1:20:07] <BakerBrute> @tyrano191 I am a Negative. You are now Asian.
[1:20:12] <+JenovasPuppet> You can't recycle humans. This isn't Prey.
[1:20:12] <turf_wind_and_fire> @deviljhojho94 soooo nothing out of the normal?

[1:21:01] <dekkitout> look at this orgy of evidence
[1:21:05] <tyrano_the_wise> Kingpin was right
[1:21:05] <%DrDarkhart> @thewhiterice92 His mind control when he's not actively watching them will wear off. SO he chose people who would be loyal to him in return for power.
[1:21:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[1:21:06] <AlasterAngelo> Fisk wasn't planning on going to jail
[1:21:09] <Demon_chann> Poor fisk
[1:21:16] <dekkitout> rip fisk-chan

[1:21:56] <Clu_Flynn> YOU THINK MJ!?
[1:21:57] <dekkitout> this bigger than east v west beef
[1:21:59] <%DrDarkhart> This game does not pull punches
[1:22:01] <+JenovasPuppet> Why didn't he just go in that way!?
[1:22:03] <AtlasMcCoy> "I dont like Mr Osborn. So i'm gonna mass murder like, a million people instead of him."
[1:22:04] <%PipIV> Hobo lovin' Mr Li? bakana

[1:22:07] <+DHB05> hi @DesuDesuDokiDoki :)
[1:22:08] <+bread_assassin> I got to say. I don't know why the Demons waited until Fisk went to jail. It seems like they could have mopped the floor with Fisk's henchmen.
[1:22:12] <dawnengel> damn those moves are smooth and look awesome
[1:22:16] <mightyfat> Martin got beef
[1:22:22] <wired_soul> got it
[1:22:23] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @turf_wind_and_fire more bombing public event taken seriously. Plus we got a MGS2 style character switch for a sec
[1:22:23] <Hidashi13> biggie didnt die for this
[1:22:25] <tyrano_the_wise> Fisk gets shit done
[1:22:32] <Riki_Mau> that's fair
[1:22:32] <%deviljhojho94> fisk is a big guy
[1:22:35] <thelonechris> "I'm gonna blow up the town because fuck you Norman!"

[1:22:50] <hntronium> Martin Li is a cool guy
[1:22:51] <circular7> you're be our side kick :D
[1:22:56] <%Remery_> Well the game couldn't be all Shocker and flirting with Exs
[1:22:57] <crimsonharvest> bombs that size destory entire block
[1:23:02] <%violetheart> I mean
[1:23:02] <Demon_chann> This got too real
[1:23:03] <%deviljhojho94> Gonna get franked
[1:23:05] <+Maids4lyfe> what? no
[1:23:05] <AtlasMcCoy> Whens next punisher game?
[1:23:06] <Ropcord> they should just set up construction sites outside norman's offices and then abandon them ü§î
[1:23:06] <+JenovasPuppet> Does finding thugs webbed up at a place constitute probable cause to search the place?
[1:23:06] <%violetheart> Spiderman could solve it by shooting everyone.
[1:23:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> They have magic tho.
[1:23:09] <kwangalang> terroism
[1:23:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> How many heroes are based in New York?..
[1:23:11] <dekkitout> i was expecting green animal/element themed villains, not a season of 24
[1:23:12] <+TheBigO75> Where the hell is Frank
[1:23:12] <$Mendin> This is Big Trouble In Little China Meets Modern Terrorism
[1:23:13] <thewhiterice92> Terror attacks you would think would be a problem for the Avengers or something
[1:23:15] <%dozind16> youve got alot to learn about spiderman
[1:23:15] <+Maids4lyfe> have you actually read spider-man pat?
[1:23:15] <%deviljhojho94> FRANKED
[1:23:15] <%badchoice5> Have you considered simply killing all the Demons?
[1:23:16] <mtgtin> This is like low tier Avengers stuff
[1:23:16] <%lols_royce> kill the bombs
[1:23:16] <%thehylianwolfo> Punisher would solve this easily
[1:23:17] <$Piemono> How often does Frank deal with people who shoot magical energy beams?
[1:23:17] <wired_soul> uncle frank
[1:23:18] <mightyfat> To be fair, fuck Norman Osborn
[1:23:19] <Demon_chann> GOD I WISH FRANK WAS ON THIS
[1:23:19] <jordanj4444> Spidey deals with this a lot in comics too though lol
[1:23:20] <zal_silverfang> turn out this is all just Screwball again
[1:23:21] <GPAlpha> Dangit Frank
[1:23:23] <%Felremi> asshole frank
[1:23:23] <XdaXcaptainX> hes busy killin someone else
[1:23:25] <+SomeSortOfMagic> @AngriestPat wouldn't the avengers get involved at this point for realz
[1:23:29] <+SirRoyco> Punisher would be terrible fighting terrorists
[1:23:32] <KayThree> would bullets even work on these guys? they shoot lasers and shit
[1:23:34] <Haydong> if only we had a AAA punisher game
[1:23:35] <+Proposition__Joe> The Immortal Iron Fist, by Platinum Games
[1:23:35] <dekkitout> id shill for a warmachine punisher game
[1:23:36] <+G_Thunders> It goes even harder in that direction soon
[1:23:37] <$floridianman> gotta get SSS
[1:23:38] <turf_wind_and_fire> Man I really missed some shit then, huh?
[1:23:43] <+altairibnlaahad909> the avengers are on vacation
[1:23:45] <tyrano_the_wise> This guys with mask are on plain sight and the police does nothing
[1:23:45] <Limes528> The Defenders are busy being depressed or something
[1:23:48] <%DrDarkhart> @SomeSortOfMagic They vaguely mention that the Avengers are on the West coast if I remember right
[1:23:49] <+JenovasPuppet> @SomeSortOfMagic The Avengers are "Always out. Probably on the West Coast."
[1:23:53] <%PipIV> ya hear what happens to Martin? "yeah, he got Franked"
[1:23:55] <+xXCrustybunsXx> Spider Man has delt with a lot of city terror problems for the record
[1:23:59] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @turf_wind_and_fire yeaaaaaah
[1:24:02] <%deviljhojho94> We terrorists now
[1:24:03] <$SGrim> @Proposition__Joe why must you hurt me with impossible dreams. rooCry
[1:24:04] <nekodelic> the funny thing about Spider-Man is that he's been through so many different stories that literally everything fits the character
[1:24:05] <turf_wind_and_fire> Whooooooa what costume does he have on?! That looks slick!
[1:24:06] <%badchoice5> Don't worry, it's not killing them, just humanely removing their legs
[1:24:10] <jordanj4444> The trip mines are so fucking fun to use lol
[1:24:11] <%SaltyDongs> I see
[1:24:12] <+xXCrustybunsXx> You can stick them to people too
[1:24:15] <+JenovasPuppet> Put the trip mine on a dude
[1:24:19] <Ropcord> he didn't see nothin
[1:24:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @AngriestPat Yo PRO TIP: If you shoot a trip mine directly at a guy, you can take out two dudes at once.
[1:24:20] <Hidashi13> frank what you doing with rhodies armour? its mine now
[1:24:20] <%deviljhojho94> that is the black cat reward costume
[1:24:25] <Parapattern> Spiderman has probably called Frank "Franklin" at least once.
[1:24:27] <+FrostMass22> @nekodelic That's why western comics suck
[1:24:28] <secretbosssauce> I mean Spider-man has basically delt with everthing in the Marvel Universe from terrorists, to the ghost of Thanos in the spirit realm.
[1:24:29] <turf_wind_and_fire> Looks sick as hell
[1:24:31] <CrimsonCore90> How is a mine not going to kill people
[1:24:34] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @turf_wind_and_fire dark suit from completing Black Cat‚Äôs sidequests
[1:24:37] <jordanj4444> @angriestpat Yeah as others are saying, stick them on dudes, it'sg reat lol
[1:24:39] <%thehylianwolfo> @turf_wind_and_fire You missed actual terrorism
[1:24:40] <Clu_Flynn> they're like " what was that nose?"
[1:24:41] <%DrDarkhart> I love sticking two guys together with trip ines
[1:24:42] <AtlasMcCoy> STEALTH
[1:24:43] <%deviljhojho94> holy shit
[1:24:46] <dekkitout> i called dibbs on the armor after rhodes died SeriousSloth
[1:24:47] <Limes528> @turf_wind_and_fire It's from Spider-Man and Deadpoll comic. Black Cat makes it for him in this game
[1:24:48] <+JenovasPuppet> Yes
[1:24:51] <%SaltyDongs> no
[1:24:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> big snek
[1:24:53] <dawnengel> damn that looks so good
[1:24:54] <tyrano_the_wise> sooooo... does this guys go to jail? or not cause mind control
[1:24:54] <%PipIV> @parapattern only once. under his breathe. when Frank left the room

[1:25:03] <%craig_t> @AngriestPat not the biggest expert on mr negative, but i think sending punichser after him would end....well, proabbly not hilariously abdly, the punisher is jsut another "peak human" soldier who if the writer isn't wanking him off would go down easy to any top tier sueprbrawler, but it wouldn't be pretty (for the generla populace)

[1:25:36] <hntronium> Not dead, I saw web strings
[1:25:36] <+G_Thunders> I love how he‚Äôs just beating up mind-controlled people and still being snarky about it
[1:25:38] <%violetheart> Something about that swing kick tickles me to no end. It looks so silly but it's so good for knocking guys off buildings.
[1:25:39] <%Remery_> his head bounced
[1:25:43] <tyrano_the_wise> gravity, man's only weakness
[1:25:46] <+altairibnlaahad909> WEB SWING!

[1:25:56] <wired_soul> no scope
[1:26:03] <al0nem0nster> As we learned from policenauts, lack of gravity is man's other weakness.
[1:26:09] <%badchoice5> Wouldn't it be more spider-like to just poison Mr Negative when he isn't looking?
[1:26:12] <Niney_Who> The biggest terrorism
[1:26:13] <+G_Thunders> @drdarkhart wait really? There‚Äôs like hundreds of these guys though
[1:26:21] <tyrano_the_wise> guys i think Li might be a bad guy

[1:27:06] <turf_wind_and_fire> To be fair, Spidey has dealt with more terrorism stuff since mr. Negative came into the comics. Hell, spider island is technically chemical warfare.

[1:42:16] <hoopray> I love Mr. Negative, basically the MU Two Face
[1:42:20] <%thehylianwolfo> Mr. Negative is fun
[1:42:20] <+JenovasPuppet> Good work with the animation though. Made the obvious threat seem like maybe not as obvious.
[1:42:20] <tyrano_the_wise> No way Li is on it
[1:42:21] <gyrogogozeppeli> Negative Hobos
[1:42:22] <Vyctorian> Honestly could have been more evil threatening

[1:42:41] <eco419> yes Pat you are evil
[1:42:41] <%SaltyDongs> No
[1:42:41] <%PipIV> Peter's not suppose to be there
[1:42:41] <al0nem0nster> nah he's just a nerd who knows judo
[1:42:42] <%badchoice5> not important
[1:42:43] <+khalcipher> Just like killgrave
[1:42:43] <Parapattern> Good thing he has an army of Silver Surfers
[1:42:44] <+Meekest> He just wanted to get Peter beat up
[1:42:44] <+SirRoyco> He just thinks it's Parker
[1:42:44] <%topendbuzz> beat up those bums
[1:42:46] <jordanj4444> I think that's the implication lol
[1:42:46] <halospaz117> Spider is the only man who knows how to fight!
[1:42:46] <+imextremelymanly> nah just thinks hes nosey
[1:42:47] <HypeArbalest> Witnesses
[1:42:48] <$MightyMaxT> Ehhh don't worry about it
[1:42:48] <+ArcLifth> Not important
[1:42:48] <Naho_Saenoki> Martin knows what Mr. Negative does, and vice-versa, but they agree not to interfere with each other.
[1:42:48] <$magikestral> how? he avoided the electricity, that's all
[1:42:50] <%altairibnlaahad909> peter waiting until martin left before beating them up
[1:42:50] <dekkitout> but he wears a suit, thats black!
[1:42:51] <+G_Thunders> He can‚Äôt be evil, he‚Äôs too in shape
[1:42:51] <+xXCrustybunsXx> Yeah he knows
[1:42:52] <%Cynful_Pleasures> Not important
[1:42:52] <MonsterEnvy> I don't think he knows just that he wanted Peter beaten to death
[1:42:54] <cherubsanonymous> Time to fight the Chinaman
[1:42:54] <dekkitout> therefore, evil
[1:42:54] <KiraKamixephos> He does
[1:42:54] <circular7> peter knows kung fu
[1:42:55] <rodgarrodgarson> every New Yorker knows Jeet KunDo
[1:42:56] <%MrBorisMakarov> he just thinks he's snooping around
[1:42:57] <kwangalang> that didnt seem murdery tbh
[1:42:57] <%badchoice5> Peter is collateral damage
[1:42:59] <JeremyHundertmark> PAT ARE YOU STILL STARING AT THE SPODER MANS

[1:43:02] <thelonechris> No one even cares Peter just beat up some homeless people
[1:43:03] <+Meekest> It wasn't about Spider-Man it was about kicking Peter's ass
[1:43:03] <turf_wind_and_fire> I don‚Äôt think he cares
[1:43:03] <lloyddboy> MORE PIGEONS

[1:51:19] <thelonechris> Degenerative disease
[1:51:19] <%PipIV> possibly
[1:51:20] <$TheNeedlesD> He has antagonist syndrome!
[1:51:20] <lloyddboy> A STRANGER I REMAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIN

[1:51:35] <qu07h> Bad case of Fat Evil.
[1:51:35] <%kimo313> HEISENBERG
[1:51:35] <$ImasukyLomae> Norman has history with everyone
[1:51:36] <+Walopoh> Definitely, he's gradually losing his mind
[1:51:36] <MonsterEnvy> cheer200 AIM or Advanced Idea Mechanics are a group of techno terrorist and evil scientists from Marvel. They are the creators of MODOK and a bunch of other bad shit. MODOK eventully took control of the group.
[1:51:38] <%deviljhojho94> apatBig SPOILERS
[1:51:38] <%badchoice5> You know Peter, if you just killed Norman, a LOT of villains would go away...
[1:51:39] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat Advanced Idea Mechanics are a tech savvy corporation. But extremely loose morals. Like Hydra but less Nazi's. They made MODOK do a bunch of other nefarious shit. Eventually Iron Man or someone else just fuckin' bought the company and turned it into a Science branch of the Avengers. Avengers Idea Mechanics
[1:51:39] <%ThatGuyfromMars> wow that's a good joke. Norman Osborn having friends
[1:51:40] <god__of__lore> Jesus Pat is good at predicting shit

[1:51:54] <StrawberryPantsu> @god__of__lore Almost too good
[1:51:58] <cherubsanonymous> Cause Norman's a fuck
[1:51:59] <shadespiral> "Oh's Corp".
[1:51:59] <Elsewize> O's Corp
[1:51:59] <marsano168> more like the O. G's
[1:52:01] <%SaltyDongs> That's sick
[1:52:01] <dekkitout> so when and how the fuck do we go from this to sinister 6
[1:52:02] <+khalcipher> Thats a nice change
[1:52:03] <tyrano_the_wise> OH BOI

[1:53:40] <cameron66> loven you pat

[1:54:07] <%violetheart> It's almost like a supervillain made it.
[1:54:08] <%nocko_> WE CAN RULE THIS CITY TOGETHER SPIDERMAN OR WE CAN FIGHT TO THE DEATH
[1:54:09] <%ThatGuyfromMars> that's the idea, pat
[1:54:09] <%Remery_> you mean sexy
[1:54:11] <+xXCrustybunsXx> The ultimate stranger
[1:54:11] <wired_soul> neural interface
[1:54:14] <Parapattern> The ultimate swerve would be if he somehow became The Lizard.
[1:54:16] <+SparkAfterDark> literally the problem with the wiring is that he was adding too much power. this game has good writing all the way through.
[1:54:17] <dekkitout> why? cause its black? cmonBruh
[1:54:19] <%topendbuzz> yeah it sure is
[1:54:20] <gyrogogozeppeli> Otto x Peter OTP
[1:54:21] <energywarning> next step: 4 arms at once
[1:54:22] <%evilmagetim> programmed with evil

[1:54:34] <AtlasMcCoy> BibleThump

[1:54:42] <Clu_Flynn> Pete, you're an idiot
[1:54:43] <%topendbuzz> peter you need a home
[1:54:43] <+subdude_> You can barely make a functioning robot arm and now you want to make a neural interface.
[1:54:43] <yendoria> ADVANCED AUTO-JACK TECH
[1:54:43] <viewtifulr> you ever seen an arm stronger then yours that moves pat?
[1:54:44] <dekkitout> Step 3: The World!
[1:54:44] <%ThatGuyfromMars> man I like when otto starts out as the good guy
[1:54:45] <Ropcord> JUST SLEEP IN THE OFFICE I'M SURE IT'S LEGAL

[1:54:54] <+Louie_Salmon> The neural interface seems like the most important part of this
[1:54:56] <AntChodeny> Peter and Otto are good people.
[1:54:56] <%topendbuzz> look around some more
[1:54:57] <%rdark_ksu> seriously check everything
[1:54:59] <%evilmagetim> tentacles
[1:55:00] <al0nem0nster> That's a good point, why not use a control glove instead of joystics.

[1:59:58] <+rafunkk> Dr sourpuss
[1:59:59] <%dozind16> Ultimate Doc Ock is one of my favorite villaisn

[2:00:17] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @altairibnlaahad909 yeah dude, it got a lot of flak but ended up being one of the better spider stories in recent years. At least we're getting a miniseries
[2:00:19] <%gusdabus91> BUT WHAT ABOUT THE RARE TRITIUM
[2:00:22] <%Remery_> Just make 2B Otto and you can do anything you want
[2:00:23] <+xXCrustybunsXx> @Mev852_ not as a villain
[2:00:24] <Elsewize> Wait, is this game based on Ultimate?

[2:00:32] <gyrogogozeppeli> NTRING STILL
[2:00:33] <ape_hawk> "doctor octavius, why are all these... death flags in the lab???"
[2:00:37] <+thesw1tch> the whole point of science is to mitigate the risks. you don't want to blow up yourself if you can help it, otherwise no more science
[2:00:37] <AtlasMcCoy> NTR
[2:00:39] <%deviljhojho94> NTR
[2:00:39] <Limes528> @Elsewize Nope. Original universe
[2:00:39] <%altairibnlaahad909> @Elsewize no, this game is its own separate continuity
[2:00:39] <%MisterCrimson> I really hope they take this story away from Green Goblin Osbourne and into paralysed, Spider-Slayer Osbpurne
[2:00:40] <SatansDick1> ntr !!!!!!
[2:00:42] <%Meme_Platinum> @PipIV just remember the main nazi rocket guy wasn't a willing nazi

[2:00:59] <gyrogogozeppeli> Just like one of my NTR mangas
[2:01:00] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @elsewize it‚Äôs more like how Arkham took cues from multiple Batman works...
[2:01:00] <%altairibnlaahad909> @Elsewize it borrows elements from lots of other spider-man stories and continuities though but it obviously deviates in important areas
[2:01:01] <%CerberusDriver> MJ is always out of breath because shes dumb and gets herself into danger

[2:14:51] <%PipIV> ugh
[2:14:54] <ADeadDiehard> shrug
[2:14:56] <%Fairy_princess77> His Mom
[2:14:57] <%altairibnlaahad909> who knows
[2:14:57] <SeventyForce> Mother's name I think
[2:14:57] <+ATentacleMonster> Bendis is a freak
[2:14:57] <zal_silverfang> uhh. wow, that is... on the nose
[2:14:58] <$RaikenTB> uhhh...
[2:14:58] <dsauce999> LUL
[2:14:58] <%Straylightgg> cos Miles Davis is a dude
[2:14:58] <+fFailureatlife> his mom is named Rio Morales
[2:14:58] <XdaXcaptainX> because the JAZZ
[2:14:59] <%SaltyDongs> It's fine
[2:14:59] <FenixSeraph> he takes his surname from his mother
[2:15:00] <Ran196> he took his mom name
[2:15:00] <DXLelouch24> his moms name
[2:15:01] <MonsterEnvy> Mom's last name
[2:15:01] <$MightyMaxT> His Mom is Rio Morales
[2:15:02] <Max_Capacity> mothers last name?
[2:15:02] <%JaydenSai> His mom
[2:15:03] <$SGrim> Mother's name
[2:15:04] <dekkitout> alliteration, you fuck
[2:15:05] <+Calivurus> @AngriestPat what is the song that plays during the intro and break sections of your stream? I need to listen to them till I'm sick of them.
[2:15:06] <DXLelouch24> Rio Morales
[2:15:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Latinas don't take husband surnames.
[2:15:07] <%Press_X_ToJASON> because he needed to be a confederate namesake, not a trumpet player namesake
[2:15:08] <%deviljhojho94> his mom is older
[2:15:08] <reonome> his name has always been like that
[2:15:10] <+fFailureatlife> its always been that way
[2:15:11] <Demon_chann> HE TOOK HIS MOM SURNAME
[2:15:11] <$SirTerribleh> Maybe they aren't married
[2:15:11] <%DedlokPM> Mother's name
[2:15:11] <DXLelouch24> didnt change it
[2:15:12] <$Mornaka> cause Bendis is a hack @AngriestPat
[2:15:12] <maidnaut> could have been a thing where his parents kept their own surnames when they married
[2:15:13] <%shen4u> Reminder bendis writes himself as jessica jones
[2:15:13] <DXLelouch24> yes
[2:15:13] <LeonSteel> his mom's name is morales
[2:15:14] <pokechuno> Be to obvious
[2:15:15] <Tiewolf> Yes sometimes
[2:15:16] <SchroedingersFerret> Because Miles Davis is a trumpet player
[2:15:16] <zal_silverfang> in america yes
[2:15:17] <gyrogogozeppeli> sure its a thing
[2:15:17] <FenixSeraph> sometimes
[2:15:17] <%deviljhojho94> in hispanic culture its elder rules Keepo
[2:15:17] <LeonSteel> yes
[2:15:18] <%badchoice5> Probably like "I hate that my dad died so I'm taking my mom's name now"
[2:15:18] <Ran196> sometimes they do
[2:15:20] <Limes528> It's from the comics, not just this game
[2:15:20] <%Caidezes> Yes.
[2:15:21] <reonome> yes
[2:15:21] <%MrBorisMakarov> @Calivurus persona 5 music
[2:15:22] <sosuke5> Naruto did it
[2:15:24] <CaptainKarite> He may also be a Step Father
[2:15:24] <TrueWarriorJak> Yes
[2:15:24] <+ATentacleMonster> I did
[2:15:26] <%rdark_ksu> He took his moms name cause his dad is dead and it makes him sad
[2:15:26] <pabloelenano2> @AngriestPat thats a lie
[2:15:26] <Dreigun> sometimes -- I have my mom's last name
[2:15:27] <NYCrownlessKing> but miles isn't a latina mom @AngriestPat
[2:15:28] <kwangalang> ??you can choose your moms surname
[2:15:28] <pokechuno> Yhes
[2:15:28] <XdaXcaptainX> since when the fuck, bullshit
[2:15:33] <%DedlokPM> Some people do, yes
[2:15:33] <Max_Capacity> miles morales davis?
[2:15:33] <%PipIV> Bendis is hit or miss
[2:15:36] <tearsaurther> His mom is rio tanaka
[2:15:36] <NYCrownlessKing> so why did he not take his dads last name @AngriestPat
[2:15:36] <%deviljhojho94> YEYEYEYE CANCERJIZZ WHEN

[2:16:09] <turf_wind_and_fire> RADIOACTIVE SPIDER JIZZ

[2:16:15] <TrueWarriorJak> @AngriestPat I have my dad's last name but my sisters have my mother last name
[2:16:15] <Naho_Saenoki> Friendly reminder that while Mr. Negative and Martin Li are technically the same guy, they are VERY different people with different powers. Mr. Negative corrupts people, and Martin Li is able to heal people by being near them and/or touching them. He once cured Eddie Brock's cancer by touching him.

[2:20:12] <wydamn> no, if it were to be a documented crime, you'd want to find the most shocking with the lowest maximum sentence in the jurisdiction you're commiting it in.
[2:20:15] <Tiewolf> he used to pay and then run with the goodaz
[2:20:16] <+Ell1ot> WHY?
[2:20:17] <jordanj4444> It was a REALLY FAST crime

[2:20:31] <Niney_Who> Avengers are all in California, Fantastic Four isn't real
[2:20:31] <$Piemono> @AngriestPat you ever hear about the one-off Spider-man Villain, The Thousand? He ate the spider that bit Peter and turned into a thousand sentient spiders that wore people like skin suits.
[2:20:32] <%badchoice5> 100 Heroes, 1000 wanna be vilains
[2:20:33] <AncelDeLambert> sorry, say what now?
[2:20:33] <Fwamingdwagon12> Avengers are out of town
[2:20:34] <%deviljhojho94> new york should be a paradise
[2:20:36] <%promo808> they're all dealing with planet shit

[2:20:39] <zal_silverfang> @AngriestPat THE AVENGERS TOWER IS RIGHT THERE
[2:20:40] <+khalcipher> BECAUSE HEROES DO OTHER STUFF

[2:20:41] <%shen4u> Civil war 2
[2:20:43] <+FrostMass22> Shut up, that's how
[2:20:43] <mtgtin> Avengers are on the West coast I thinl
[2:20:46] <gyrogogozeppeli> Theyre not heroes as a fulltime job
[2:20:48] <%Caidezes> New York is a big place. Heroes got shit to do.
[2:20:49] <%deviljhojho94> fantastic four too
[2:20:49] <al0nem0nster> The crime density is so high that this happens in every city every other week.
[2:20:50] <+LogothX> The defenders
[2:20:51] <dekkitout> civil war 2 NotLikeThis
[2:20:52] <fairore> @kwangalang don't be that guy man
[2:20:53] <%Clinnamon> JJJ is right and they let tragedies happen so they can play hero
[2:20:53] <kwangalang> they are "busy"
[2:20:57] <%evilmagetim> only NY or Nazi Germany
[2:20:57] <StrawberryPantsu> Fantastic 4
[2:20:57] <al0nem0nster> and 5 times a day in new york.
[2:20:57] <Huntercd> Punisher
[2:20:58] <%badmr7> hell kitchen street heroes
[2:20:58] <pede2011> IS BASICALLY A WAR ZONE

[2:21:04] <thewhiterice92> Avengers, Xmen, F4, Spiderman, Daredevil, Defenders, Punisher
[2:21:04] <+TheBigO75> Like 10 hero
[2:21:05] <%SvenHolgersson> STRANGE
[2:21:06] <lloyddboy> PUN PUN
[2:21:07] <Niney_Who> @AngriestPat X-Men and Fantastic 4 are owned by Fox, and the Avengers in this game are stated to be in California.
[2:21:07] <gyrogogozeppeli> Half of them are street level and not Superman
[2:21:08] <%JaydenSai> Doctor Strange
[2:21:10] <$Mornaka> probably 50 lower street levels too
[2:21:11] <AFlyingTaco1> How the fuck could crimes even happen there?
[2:21:11] <+TheBigO75> 10 FUCKING HEROES
[2:21:12] <+PenmanLupine> @AngriestPat I think when Spider-man says that the Avengers are spending their time on the West Coast, that's an MCU joke
[2:21:12] <$nademonkey1100> The justice league

[2:21:24] <%PipIV> MOON KNIGHT
[2:21:24] <+khalcipher> Doctor strange never helps tho
[2:21:25] <%xxviios> Legit there is a lot crime
[2:21:26] <ADeadDiehard> I bet LA doesn't have to put up with this
[2:21:26] <+LogothX> All of Wakand is localized in NYC
[2:21:26] <AFlyingTaco1> Like the Punisher alone would put a stop to half of it
[2:21:28] <LeonSteel> moon knight too
[2:21:29] <%Press_X_ToJASON> there is a hero on your block, guaranteed
[2:21:29] <Tiewolf> Iron man is in cali
[2:21:33] <Niney_Who> Daredevil could not fight Electro
[2:21:34] <IminyourBase> everyone is busy shut u p
[2:21:35] <AncelDeLambert> that's his name. How ya gonna say Negative isn't magic when Strange exists?
[2:21:35] <%shen4u> Punisher would probably be the one who deals with most of the criminals
[2:21:35] <al0nem0nster> Not enough people are being born to justify the number of evil dooers.
[2:21:37] <%SvenHolgersson> Sounds like thats the case
[2:21:37] <CatmanIX> it's all the mutagens in the water, JJJ KNOWS WHAT UP
[2:21:38] <GarettLefebvr> Don't forget the West Coast Avengers
[2:21:39] <$MightyMaxT> There was actually a map of who operates where in a comic semi-recently
[2:21:39] <%Dimfish> doctor strange literally should be able to stop any or all of the issues in new york, but he might just not give a fuck
[2:21:39] <wired_soul> ANELE
[2:21:41] <dekkitout> id love to visit little wakanda in new york
[2:21:41] <+fFailureatlife> Why wasnt moon knight in MVCI FeelsBadMan

[2:21:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> every second every day
[2:21:46] <%Felremi> multiple universe theory
[2:21:46] <secretbosssauce> New York is both a fortress, and a massive target from paranormal forces.
[2:21:47] <gyrogogozeppeli> They have social lives too
[2:21:48] <Ge3b0t> New York is almost destroyed on a daily basis but only some heroes deal with certain villains
[2:21:48] <pede2011> ITS REALLY EASY, JUST NEED 2 PLANES
[2:21:50] <%badmr7> all crimes happening simultaneously
[2:21:53] <%badchoice5> Too many Mumen Riders, not enough One Punch Men

[2:22:00] <shadespiral> "Yew Nork"
[2:22:02] <%SvenHolgersson> Rent might actually be affordable in Marvel NYC
[2:22:04] <XdaXcaptainX> WHY IS JJJ SO OBSESSED WITH SPIDERMAN AND NOT THE HULK OR SOME SHIT
[2:22:04] <saiyan24675> Why even do crime in New York since it has a bunch of heroes
[2:22:07] <kwangalang> why doesnt spiderman just get help from iron man ... you know the billionaire
[2:22:07] <+FrostMass22> Yew Nork

[2:22:26] <AlasterAngelo> The Inhumans are irrelevant and dead
[2:22:26] <%Clinnamon> the Marvel Universe is just Franklin Richard's playground and superheroes are toys in his imagination
[2:22:28] <%shen4u> Nobody cares about the inhumans
[2:22:28] <$SGrim> @Dimfish the canon explanation is that Strange is looking after entire dimensions, so he ocasionally misses the smaller stuff.

[2:22:50] <%shen4u> Didn't they go off to space anyway?
[2:22:52] <zal_silverfang> the only way it works is that ALL the heros are always off doing bigger shit and just leave spiderman as clean up for their town. "yeah, fuck it let the spider do it"

[2:37:10] <turf_wind_and_fire> I think it‚Äôs just a break?
[2:37:10] <TrueWarriorJak> Yeah Spider powers all the way Spider sense is the most OP shit
[2:37:12] <%goose_attack_almanac> Some dude fuckin' bought A.I.M. and turned it into an Avengers branch. Avenger's Idea Mechanics
[2:37:12] <crimsonharvest> Bits come from watching ads though
[2:37:13] <%Agami23> you can farm bits though
[2:37:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Bits are free money
[2:37:15] <Ge3b0t> someone should show pat spinnerette
[2:37:15] <+fFailureatlife> @Hidashi13 Yes soriku
[2:37:18] <$RaikenTB> bits can be had for free.
[2:37:18] <thewhiterice92> @PipIV He's a mediocre writer and sometimes bad, the reason he's so shit is because Marvel was having him write like 8 books at once
[2:37:19] <%gusdabus91> apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatPorgmo apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace
[2:37:19] <+FrostMass22> Unless it's free bits

[2:37:31] <wired_soul> so i can get some attention haha
[2:37:37] <Niney_Who> Oh actually that's fair
[2:37:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Maybe do't buy an xbox1x with no money
[2:37:40] <Niney_Who> You can get bits from TwitchRPG
[2:37:43] <Niney_Who> Twitch-RPG
[2:37:47] <%ThatGuyfromMars> it doesn't help that marvel keeps relaunching comics just to get people to buy them
[2:37:48] <%Fairy_princess77> They did that with "THe initiative" story line.
[2:37:49] <%deviljhojho94> that shit was hype
[2:37:50] <SatansDick1> rad
[2:37:50] <$RaikenTB> awesome.
[2:37:54] <dekkitout> oh, THAT story..
[2:38:00] <zoopbooploop> What was the name of that one story with the baby?
[2:38:02] <CrimsonSkeletons> Pat's not M-preg, i don't think.
[2:38:03] <%Agami23> he also puts shockers arm against his unarmored head, which would kill him.
[2:38:06] <fmc009> WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT CHROMA IS SUPER GOOD
[2:38:12] <$TheNeedlesD> It is.
[2:38:14] <%Fairy_princess77> They had Avengers for every state
[2:38:16] <%SaltyDongs> HELL YEAH
[2:38:16] <+TheBigO75> Peter pulls his punches all the time
[2:38:17] <+SuichiTanaka> Spectacular Spider-Man is the best, yes
[2:38:18] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat I'd love to see Spider-Man in my old home town. Have fun swinging around the grain silo jackass
[2:38:18] <EBT93> For the person asking about that Black Cat vomit, it happened in issue 85
[2:38:18] <dekkitout> it really is
[2:38:20] <Ge3b0t> best symbiote is toxin
[2:38:20] <%Caidezes> Spectacular SPider-Man is amazing.
[2:38:20] <Niney_Who> @AngriestPat he might've gotten the Bits from Twitch-RPG given they have Surveys for bits
[2:38:22] <Freedom_EX> agree
[2:38:23] <zoopbooploop> I was trying to remember that one last week when discussing a Pathfinder character wuth a friend
[2:38:25] <$Mornaka> also dope theme song
[2:38:25] <mtgtin> GREAT
[2:38:26] <SoushinSen> the silence is everything
[2:38:28] <secretbosssauce> Can cinfirm
[2:38:29] <$Kefbar> cheer300 dont worry pat i got those bits for free from watching the new amazon series but i still wanna support you and paige so here have the rest also ;-) Keep doing what you do
[2:38:31] <$hatesdps> as a canadian who lives in america now i gotta say that the cops would not be nearly as chill with that fake gun bullshit in an urban setting
[2:38:31] <%PipIV> spectacular. spectacular Spider-Man
[2:38:31] <Tearonex> it's pretty alright,
[2:38:34] <MonsterEnvy> It's great
[2:38:34] <dekkitout> dammit why was it canceled NotLikeThis
[2:38:37] <circular7> that show was pretty good
[2:38:37] <Limes528> I didn't like Spectacular Venom's voice. Doc Ock was amazing in that show, though
[2:38:42] <thewhiterice92> @PipIV he's also super shit now because he wanted to either FORCE MOVIE SYNERGY or he would create OCs like Miles that aren't very good
[2:38:44] <%altairibnlaahad909> @dekkitout because of disney
[2:38:46] <DXLelouch24> Swinging on the edge, fighting crimes spinning webs
[2:38:47] <MonsterEnvy> We know why it was canceled cause of Rights issues
[2:38:48] <turf_wind_and_fire> GODDAMMIT PAT PUT DOWN THAT REDBULL
[2:38:48] <%brackboi> YEAH YEAH YEAH
[2:38:50] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Spectacular Spiderman is legitimately the best Spiderman cartoon ever. I'm genuinely sad I missed out on that show and so annoyed that it got canned when Disney grabbed Marvel by the balls
[2:38:53] <wired_soul> ultimate spider man on gamecube was fun
[2:39:00] <%xxviios> Play Red Dead Revolver!
[2:39:01] <sparrrow_> man Pat's eyes are so squinted
[2:39:03] <+SuichiTanaka> The theme song is almost as good as the original 60's too
[2:39:04] <dekkitout> the mouse always kills everything i love FeelsBadMan
[2:39:07] <secretbosssauce> Pat should watch the Ultimate Spider-man cartoon, and time himself
[2:39:10] <KiraKamixephos> WHATS ABOUT SUPER MARIO PARTY
[2:39:10] <%goose_attack_almanac> @dekkitout Because Disney wanted to take a shot with Ultimate Spider-man, and Sony is holding it hostage
[2:39:13] <%deacon1621> Oh cool, Grand Theft Horse on the stream
[2:39:14] <Vanllin> yeah I loved ultimate Spiderman on the gc
[2:39:17] <+TheBigO75> Nooooooo

[2:45:13] <al0nem0nster> Tombstone is the owner of a successfull frozen pizza business.
[2:45:14] <b1gboss007> cooler luke cage
[2:45:16] <Ge3b0t> if he's albino
[2:45:17] <CrimsonSkeletons> Tombstone is the heir to the Tombstone tv dinner fortune.

[2:45:21] <Ge3b0t> just get him in the sun
[2:45:22] <+Ell1ot> Mr. Tombstone vs Fisk in a fist fight. Who wins?
[2:45:24] <+baseball7000> @hatesdps That's Hammerhead.
[2:45:28] <echodrone81> he was played by Keith David in the cartoon
[2:45:30] <Ge3b0t> let him get skin cancer

[2:45:42] <gyrogogozeppeli> see easy peasy

[2:46:09] <%Clinnamon> Tombstone was good in Spectacular but that's because he was basically Kingpin
[2:46:10] <CatmanIX> wait, did she just nab a GPS tracker?

[2:54:31] <Naho_Saenoki> @fFailureatlife His launcher is Spider Sting from MvC.
[2:54:32] <+temporal_zenith> @DakotaChip He works out a lot
[2:54:34] <EBT93> @ffailureatlife his launcher is basically Spider-sting and he does do a web-swing
[2:54:36] <Ge3b0t> I mean kingpin is just muscle
[2:54:36] <%deviljhojho94> he is not an insect jackass, he is an arachnid
[2:54:41] <%badchoice5> No, Spiderman is using tazer fists and tazer boots
[2:54:49] <+imextremelymanly> top right is good
[2:54:49] <+fFailureatlife> i want him to do a maximum spider
[2:54:51] <Kavtech> Marvel humans are quite hardy.
[2:54:53] <$RaikenTB> use the bunshin
[2:54:59] <$magikestral> low gravity would help
[2:55:00] <Haydong> quad damage!
[2:55:02] <%ArcanumMBD> It's totally fine, they're reinforced by negative magic... except for Kingpin's guys... and the thugs... and some other regular mooks
[2:55:03] <%deviljhojho94> Marvel humans are superhuman like LOTR Men
[2:55:05] <Baconrath> use your crime lasers
[2:55:07] <%PipIV> kingpin is like 90% muscle?
[2:55:08] <extradopeness> Wheres maximum spider
[2:55:13] <+temporal_zenith> @badchoice5 You just reminded me of batman's taser tank
[2:55:14] <+imextremelymanly> also the one next to witch time is good for fighting too
[2:55:22] <%deviljhojho94> no kingpin is just a """"""""normal""""""""" guy
[2:55:22] <Ge3b0t> also someone mentioned spiderman shooting webs from his junk to which I say, check the spinnerete web comic.
[2:55:27] <+fFailureatlife> i want there to be a MVC style game thats JUST marvel characters
[2:55:27] <ntr_nakadashi> So how finite are tokens? Specifically the backpack and landmark tokens, been petrified to spend them in case I can't get them back after buying something shitty

[2:55:43] <gyrogogozeppeli> ELEVATORS WILL CRUSH THEM
[2:55:46] <%PipIV> this is the most absurd
[2:55:46] <SatansDick1> these guys are so fucking dead
[2:55:52] <%deviljhojho94> KILL THEM ALL PETER
[2:55:53] <%ThatGuyfromMars> and kingpin has influence, which is a superpower, he makes shit fuckin happen
[2:55:55] <SeventyForce> Kinpin had trained non-stop since child hood and shet, still a freakzoid
[2:55:56] <%deviljhojho94> JUST LIKE UNCLE BEN TAUGHT YA
[2:55:59] <viewtifulr> elavader will finish them off
[2:56:01] <%ArcanumMBD> (except not really cause these elevators have magic sensors and stop when they reach spidey)
[2:56:02] <%SaltyDongs> Good job peter

[3:06:49] <%MisterCrimson> I'll be honest, if some guy could give me general grievous arms, I'd go for it
[3:06:59] <%king_strongstyle> Docs thinking what if I had 8 set of dicks

[3:07:06] <SunnyD_Solaire> Nerd shit
[3:07:06] <Baconrath> doodBigBrain
[3:07:10] <%Clinnamon> I actually really liked these puzzles, but I also loved those pipe puzzles as a kid
[3:07:12] <%skizzuto> i don't think that's how gps trackers work
[3:07:14] <Ge3b0t> that's why he makes tentacles
[3:07:14] <turf_wind_and_fire> Ok time to call it a night. See ya everybody.
[3:07:14] <ravencloak13> @mistercrimson I‚Äôd also want feet that can work like hands
[3:07:17] <%PipIV> the nerding starts
[3:07:17] <%Farples> Yay, nerd puzzles, my favorite type
[3:07:18] <%ArcanumMBD> yep just mash out a path, that'll be fine
[3:07:22] <%deviljhojho94> every part that is not swinging and fighting of this game is the worst
[3:07:25] <+StrawberryBandit> If I ever get this game I'm enabling the skip puzzle option
[3:07:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> General Grievous was my friend's answer to what kind of lightsaber he would want. Every. Time.
[3:07:27] <%king_strongstyle> Just mash
[3:07:31] <%deviljhojho94> However, those are fairly limited, which is nice
[3:07:31] <CrimsonSkeletons> What, Dead Space Ignition?!
[3:07:39] <%topendbuzz> pat
[3:07:42] <+jezred14> the wierd thing is there isn't even a trophy for NOT skipping the puzzles
[3:07:44] <zal_silverfang> BLIND
[3:07:49] <wydamn> this is like a more boring version of the pipedreams style mini game from bioshock

[3:09:16] <CrimsonSkeletons> Tombstone dinner.
[3:09:17] <tyrano_the_wise> Tombstone is a cool name
[3:09:21] <Ge3b0t> what if spiderman fucked up a swing and as a result hit his funnybone on a building?
[3:09:22] <$SweetCheeksTrap> Why is this game talking about The Living Tombstone?
[3:09:24] <%king_strongstyle> PILEDRIVE HIM
[3:09:25] <%skizzuto> tombstone is sans confirmed
[3:09:29] <ravencloak13> Does Tombstone in this game still look like a zombie?
[3:09:29] <$drabberfaun535> !uptime
[3:09:29] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 9m 31s.
[3:09:31] <AlasterAngelo> chops shops sound a lot worse than they actually are
[3:09:35] <+Manjove> inpermiable, meaning he cant get cut?
[3:09:39] <wydamn> tombstones are sometimes made from concrete.
[3:09:43] <%Clinnamon> Tombstone is definitely a more menacing name to go by than his real name LONNIE
[3:09:44] <CrimsonGargoyle> @AngriestPat you are very elegant in your spidey swingin
[3:09:44] <dekkitout> you mean solomon grundy? eh a little
[3:09:46] <AlasterAngelo> like i think chop shop i think a butcher shop but with people

[3:09:57] <Who_lio42> tombstones are delicious

[3:13:55] <nekodelic> come on, taskmaster was in mahvel
[3:13:56] <dekkitout> hes a mimic
[3:13:56] <%badchoice5> Taskmaster is the guy you send in when you need him to win briefly then lose hard
[3:13:56] <zoopbooploop> THAT'S THE CHALLENGE TOKEN THING YOU PUTZ
[3:13:57] <ravencloak13> Pat he gave himself super speed by watching a video tape in fastforward! Your not Z tier when you can just give yourself powers!

[3:14:20] <DeathByPoke7> he has the sharingan and a skull face
[3:14:20] <theobble> He beat the shit out of the avengers by himself
[3:14:20] <EMP_Ike_Turner> remember how Taskmaster learned his power? how he perfectly mimicked an Olympic dive but almost drowned because he didn't know how to swim
[3:14:21] <+StrawberryBandit> So he's an Uchiha? LUL
[3:14:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> THE FUCKING SHARINGAN

[3:14:27] <DXLelouch24> TRUST ME
[3:14:27] <CrimsonSkeletons> Taskmaster books wrestling matches, that's his power.
[3:14:28] <vampireinarm> whoever said is a stand is a basic bitch
[3:14:28] <AtlasMcCoy> BibleThump
[3:14:28] <%shen4u> So he has the sharingan?
[3:14:30] <reonome> wow that sounds stupid
[3:14:30] <%PipIV> TaskMaster has his own school for hired costume goons
[3:14:32] <XdaXcaptainX> HE HAS A PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY OF EVERYTHING EVER. his brain doesnt even have room to store it
[3:14:32] <AlasterAngelo> remember when Taskmaster kicked Captain America's ass

[3:14:43] <dsauce999> Ben BibleThump
[3:14:47] <zal_silverfang> @AngriestPat and he can read you actions before you even do them so not only can he copy your movement style he can counter it before you do it
[3:14:51] <ravencloak13> @angriestpat He also gave himself super speed by watching a DvD in fast forward
[3:14:52] <Tearonex> @AngriestPat You may want to do the boxes at your leisure, you get something cool for doing them
[3:14:53] <+paladinstarbuster> BITCH WHAT?
[3:14:54] <$RaikenTB> Doctor Lizard PogChamp

[3:15:02] <+Bupkis7> It's the lizard
[3:15:03] <$magikestral> dude go to the halloween party
[3:15:03] <DashXero> Anything a normal human can't do, he can compensate for with technology. Taskmaster is a bad dude.
[3:15:03] <+thefatfriend> dude is so sick
[3:15:04] <gyrogogozeppeli> Taskmaster can copy Unlimited Blade Works
[3:15:05] <%Clinnamon> @reonome in practice its pretty cool because he uses equipment and fighting styles from the heroes to fight them and holds his own, even without their superpowers

[3:15:17] <Ran196> its what rich people do all the time. some eyes wide shut shit
[3:15:17] <%altairibnlaahad909> taskmaster is basically batman but a supervillain
[3:15:17] <SeventyForce> It is super human at least @DedlokPM I meant if he's the version that's working for Shield again in this game, don't looks like it doe. Has the old outfit still.

[3:35:17] <DashXero> Where IS your cool shit? I know what they're talking aobut, but it should have happened immediately.
[3:35:20] <nekodelic> you need 5
[3:35:28] <Tearonex> @AngriestPat We did say different challenged
[3:35:30] <AtlasMcCoy> You need to do 20 actually
[3:35:30] <DXLelouch24> oh its 5 not 3?

[3:35:37] <DXLelouch24> no 20 is for round 2
[3:35:37] <%Superstarsage> I assume it's the taskmaster
[3:35:38] <hntronium> There are only two types of challenges
[3:35:38] <Austin0097> The chat is just big dick liars.
[3:35:38] <+shawntk_> @DashXero I think he needs to do at least one drone for it to happen
[3:35:39] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> i think is 3 different challenges
[3:35:44] <+imextremelymanly> maybe it is more challenges it happened to me within seconds of swingin
[3:35:45] <DeathByPoke7> is taskmaster going to unleash his chidori
[3:35:46] <Estuko> did everyone just agree lmao
[3:35:48] <nekodelic> I'm pretty sure it's 5
[3:35:48] <SunnyD_Solaire> Prob 4 or 5 yea
[3:35:50] <mercado94> So is it 5?
[3:35:51] <Darkrun2> combat challenge should be available in the financial district

[3:53:20] <$gozzojt27> these are easier and fun
[3:53:23] <%badchoice5> lol fuck you civilians
[3:53:23] <%8BitDsx> SPIDER-DICK
[3:53:24] <%DedlokPM> COMBAT TIME!
[3:53:25] <Ge3b0t> watch pat utterly fail
[3:53:26] <extradopeness> First fucking try
[3:53:27] <Vanllin> don't forget tombstone
[3:53:28] <Estuko> LUL assaulting citizens
[3:53:28] <tyrano_the_wise> this can be actually fun
[3:53:30] <%Farples> And this is the moment where pat just completely fogets the controls
[3:53:30] <SailingSaturn> @AngriestPat at least the controls are good, imagine if they weren't cirPrise
[3:53:33] <%anime_boyz> use the spider bro for these
[3:53:34] <CatmanIX> WALKS RIGHT PAST IT "WHERE'S IT AT?"
[3:53:34] <dekkitout> *slaps hood of game* This baby can hold so many challenges!

[3:53:53] <Niney_Who> Got hit, rip
[3:53:59] <wired_soul> shoot ur spidey load everywhere with the big AOE
[3:54:00] <MrUnimportant> "IS about to kill a diplomat". Grammar, Taskmaster.
[3:54:00] <extradopeness> Stay focused
[3:54:03] <+Gravity_Gunner> Does somebody want to tell Taskmaster that he can copy Spidey‚Äôs motions as much as he wants but without his Spider-Sense he‚Äôs going to fall to his death?
[3:54:05] <SunnyD_Solaire> Try to not get hit
[3:54:05] <buddahdisciple> I‚Äôm sorry we lied to you pat. I wish there was a cool moment
[3:54:06] <+imextremelymanly> its best to equip the combo extender on this one
[3:54:08] <KiraKamixephos> Kill fast
[3:54:10] <XdaXcaptainX> pat you shoulda just opened with a web blossom
[3:54:12] <b1gboss007> Kill them all peter
[3:54:21] <tyrano_the_wise> welp
[3:54:27] <AlasterAngelo> f
[3:54:32] <$magikestral> there should be a cool moment, i just watched one on youtube. Might need ALL of the challenges though, i didnt look into it
[3:54:35] <alexandrecau> that's one way to murder a diplomat
[3:54:36] <SunnyD_Solaire> F
[3:54:40] <juhbathehutt> enjoy your silver
[3:54:40] <Ge3b0t> f
[3:54:40] <TheWozy> The 4x damage ability really helps on these
[3:54:49] <+fFailureatlife> i like that the timer freezes for takedowns
[3:54:52] <tmo200> There is a cool moment for half of the challenges i think
[3:54:53] <%shen4u> He also has web blossom
[3:54:53] <%8BitDsx> Web blossommmmm
[3:55:02] <+imextremelymanly> suit abilities work here too pat
[3:55:04] <$gozzojt27> electro fists ftw for these
[3:55:06] <pokechuno> Failed
[3:55:07] <%shen4u> Spiderbuddy might help here too
[3:55:11] <AntChodeny> Pat and Paige being in the Dare Devil comics is canon, right? So does that mean the Best Friends are part of the MCU?
[3:55:15] <%8BitDsx> THEY GUY GOT SHOT
[3:55:15] <tyrano_the_wise> that guy got shot ded
[3:55:17] <b1gboss007> Webbing gives more points
[3:55:24] <Ge3b0t> zubaz is a z tier hero
[3:55:25] <tmo200> I spammed gadgets and spider bros for these missions
[3:55:26] <+imextremelymanly> electricity punches is a good one for this
[3:55:26] <%thewordofhelix> FRIENDLY FIRE!
[3:55:28] <AlasterAngelo> Zubaz is in the MCU
[3:55:42] <+GrizzlySpet> my cat just knocked a whole pizza face down on the floor
[3:55:42] <+zabemareu> @angriestpat I'm curious is there any reason for the choice of web blossom over battle focus or any other skill?
[3:55:45] <zal_silverfang> wait why are they giving you points for downing guys when you need to down them all win? the only variable here is time
[3:55:52] <wired_soul> maybe do big AOE attack ok
[3:55:53] <AntChodeny> Elmo will be the one to kill Thanos.
[3:55:53] <$Mornaka> Web blossom pat
[3:55:54] <%DamnKrazy> Use gadgets
[3:55:54] <XdaXcaptainX> p bad
[3:55:54] <Tearonex> @AngriestPat You gotta pretty much have no damage to get gold
[3:55:55] <%anime_boyz> use your gadgets more and use spider bro for better time
[3:56:00] <tmo200> Spider bro last longer, is aoe, a
[3:56:01] <Vanllin> Web and gadget
[3:56:02] <%badchoice5> here it comes
[3:56:03] <raminnoodle420> gadgets
[3:56:03] <Fujiwara_92> GADGETS
[3:56:04] <Dragon_Batman> I think speed and health are the big factors
[3:56:05] <+around_40_jobbers> total combo and final health are basically the same thing
[3:56:06] <%badmr7> getting them down counts
[3:56:06] <raminnoodle420> WEB
[3:56:07] <%ArcanumMBD> @angriestpat webbing a dude and slamming them (air hold triangle, throw into wall, jump off them to launch into wall, etc) is an insta KO. helps with speed
[3:56:07] <SPidERMan8576> its all about time, gotta do it way faster
[3:56:08] <Bouldus> thank for the notification twitch :/
[3:56:08] <SunnyD_Solaire> Here we go
[3:56:10] <+in_spaaace> Use gadgets
[3:56:11] <tmo200> So i use that more than web blossom
[3:56:11] <Worldbrand> do you start with web blossom? yeah
[3:56:13] <tyrano_the_wise> This is our punishment
[3:56:13] <+imextremelymanly> they really help here though
[3:56:13] <Fwamingdwagon12> Gadgets are essential for these
[3:56:13] <extradopeness> Upgrade web bomb and use spider bro
[3:56:14] <%badmr7> so webem up
[3:56:15] <fruit_pie_the_magician> TIME IS MOST IMPORTANT
[3:56:16] <Austin0097> A big part of it is finishing them quickly as possible.

[3:56:29] <energywarning> gadgets are basically temporary buffs if you REALLY think about it
[3:56:30] <aeonicvector> blossom exists
[3:56:30] <$MightyMaxT> Impact Web is fun, same with trip mine. Everything else is eh, for me at lease
[3:56:30] <Coystick> Niether, web shot alone is pure and fluid, Gadegts suck

[4:02:09] <al0nem0nster> okay, picking up the moves of someone like iron fist I can understand, hell even Dr. Strange since all of his stuff is hand movements, but people with superhuman fighting abilities?

[4:02:25] <hitorio> !uptime
[4:02:25] <AlasterAngelo> call it what?
[4:02:25] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 2m 27s.
[4:02:26] <Vanllin> tombstone
[4:02:26] <MonsterEnvy> @AngriestPat Remember Tombstone
[4:02:26] <DXLelouch24> youll love this mission
[4:02:28] <DXLelouch24> yep
[4:02:30] <al0nem0nster> "Hahaha I copied the Hulk's fighting style, now I can never lose!" Good for him.
[4:02:30] <Tearonex> yup
[4:02:31] <+imextremelymanly> ya
[4:02:31] <+fFailureatlife> i got schooled by round 2
[4:02:31] <dekkitout> taskmaster: leave jiren to me
[4:02:31] <MonsterEnvy> @AngriestPat Tombstone
[4:02:35] <mercado94> Yep
[4:02:37] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> PARTY TIME
[4:02:39] <+DakotaChip> If you never do his challenges he can't fight you? Lolwut
[4:02:44] <+fFailureatlife> he did all the finishers on me
[4:02:46] <+khalcipher> SEE PAT HE'S A B TIER
[4:02:46] <+zabemareu> Tombstone pizzas
[4:02:46] <%badchoice5> Could Taskmaster beat Jiren by copyng him?
[4:02:49] <AlasterAngelo> but yeah Taskmaster is the hardest boss at least it was for me
[4:02:52] <Fujiwara_92> Taskmaster would be able to beat Jiren if he had time to study
[4:02:52] <Vanllin> TOMBSTONE :c
[4:02:52] <CrimsonGargoyle> task literally talks like a shitty edgy weeb. LUL
[4:02:55] <zoopbooploop> Change to a fun costume
[4:02:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[4:02:58] <%topendbuzz> oof
[4:02:59] <dsauce999> could taskmaster instantly learn ultra instinct?
[4:03:03] <+fFailureatlife> hes cool shut up
[4:03:05] <%SammyOVision> Please put on the shittiest costume you can for the party, pat.
[4:03:05] <$MightyMaxT> Not gonna lie, he totally wasted me on that . Story still progressed though
[4:03:06] <Habblewater> PETAH OIVE STADIED ALL YAW MOVES BAYBEE
[4:03:08] <SunnyD_Solaire> No
[4:03:09] <al0nem0nster> Task masker is already using ultra instinct
[4:03:13] <kwangalang> Taskmaster cannot do anything that requires actual powers, he cant lift a car or stick to walls
[4:03:15] <AlasterAngelo> @CrimsonGargoyle he had a new tork accent in Mahvel it was great
[4:03:16] <gyrogogozeppeli> Taskmaster can copy Gon's adult form
[4:03:16] <Inferno_Icon> They wanna beat him up because he sounds like Yosuke
[4:03:20] <SPidERMan8576> taskmaster is only human
[4:03:23] <%Agami23> he talks like kano! "i studied all your moves sonyaman"
[4:03:25] <Dragon_Batman> yea that sounds like a good idea
[4:03:28] <$Mornaka> "WHY WOULD YOU EVER FAST TRAVEL"
[4:03:28] <AlasterAngelo> I'M ONLY HUMAN AFTER ALL
[4:03:29] <AntChodeny> How come Pat didn't go Ultra Instinct?
[4:03:29] <SPidERMan8576> he could copy only human things
[4:03:29] <%MisterCrimson> I was gonna say, there's some big story coming up
[4:03:36] <AlasterAngelo> DON'T PUT THE BLAME ON ME
[4:03:36] <SeventyForce> If Task copies any Z fighter moves he would probably just become a vegetable.
[4:03:39] <SunnyD_Solaire> Tombstone pizza is gross
[4:03:42] <+khalcipher> nooooo do story pls
[4:03:44] <CrimsonGargoyle> HE CAN NEVER COPY GOOD STYLE
[4:03:46] <Charlie_Decker> he can copy movements at super speed if he sees them at super speed
[4:03:47] <%altairibnlaahad909> but the key is he can also anticipate movements
[4:03:48] <JaceADisgrace> ye, he's a squishy boi'
[4:03:49] <dsauce999> taskamsker
[4:03:50] <ADeadDiehard> Also he's got a memory limit on how much he can copy
[4:03:51] <$MightyMaxT> He's got Batman physique
[4:03:51] <$Piemono> Lot of really buff dudes fuck shit up
[4:03:52] <%altairibnlaahad909> so he can do proper counter attacks
[4:03:52] <Omen47> Really buff dude who fought the Avengers
[4:03:53] <lloyddboy> TAXMASTER
[4:03:54] <al0nem0nster> @AngriestPat he learned how to run faster by watching a tape on fast forward, I'm not sure he's human.
[4:03:55] <aeonicvector> He's got apex human strength iirc
[4:03:55] <%Agami23> but he could get an ironman suit
[4:03:58] <%badchoice5> Which is why him mimicking and fighting Spidey is a joke
[4:03:59] <XdaXcaptainX> i mean, neither does batman, but martial arts mastery and gadgets got him far as fuck
[4:03:59] <Habblewater> Can't fight Kite Man
[4:04:00] <%MisterCrimson> His musculature adapts itself to near superhuman capabilities if needed
[4:04:00] <Coystick> TASKMANAGER
[4:04:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat He has the Sharingan
[4:04:01] <Dragon_Batman> with his strategic capabilities that can make up for it
[4:04:02] <%altairibnlaahad909> to like best use the opponents leverage against them and so on
[4:04:03] <+TheBigO75> Basically Death Stroke
[4:04:04] <%DedlokPM> I like how the look they gave him in the game is a blend of his classic look and his look that UDON gave him in Deadpool & Agent X
[4:04:05] <Malikwest11> but he does own his own school...for villains
[4:04:05] <+imextremelymanly> leave jiran to taskmaster
[4:04:07] <Vanllin> he's peak human
[4:04:08] <%JaydenSai> @AngriestPat In fact, Taskmaster is easily beaten by Deadpool because Deadpool is a weirdo fuck that is next too impossible too read
[4:04:09] <dekkitout> he couldnt copy someones fighting style like wolverines as its based on the fact he has a healing factor
[4:04:09] <XdaXcaptainX> task master turns up the martial arts by ten thousand
[4:04:13] <VectMachine> He can copy any movement that isn't explicitly superhuman or supernatural.
[4:04:13] <%altairibnlaahad909> so he can even parry people with superhuman strength like spiderman
[4:04:14] <%thewordofhelix> BACK IN!
[4:04:16] <%SammyOVision> Basically all his points are in technique and nothing else.
[4:04:21] <SeventyForce> He can copy stuff to a T but it's also taxing on he's brain, he's memory is FUCKED
[4:04:23] <Stari> !uptime
[4:04:23] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 4m 25s.
[4:04:26] <Ropcord> LUL
[4:04:27] <SPidERMan8576> taskmaster can move at super speed for like a couple secs but gets really tired afterwards
[4:04:28] <Habblewater> zing?
[4:04:30] <AncelDeLambert> "I can learn EVERYTHING you do!... oh, you just picked up a car... you're gonna throw that at me, aren't you?"
[4:04:31] <Coystick> He can end your task tree without breaking asweat
[4:04:32] <%anime_boyz> gotta advance pretty far into the plot for the last two open world funsies to unlock
[4:04:33] <+Schrodingers_Box> Task Master can record something on a camera, speed it up. and Copy it at that speed
[4:04:37] <extradopeness> Dead Man Walkin'
[4:04:44] <SatansDick1> !uptime
[4:04:49] <%HaleScythe> I just realized Tombstones in this, damn.
[4:04:51] <al0nem0nster> I do wonder why he can't just, imagine it faster though.
[4:04:54] <EMP_Ike_Turner> punks jump up to get beat down
[4:04:55] <%Agami23> remember that time spiderman punched a women in half thinking it was wolverine?
[4:04:58] <+TheDeadpoolDash> well Spider-Man does pull his punches or else he would be punching people's jaws out of their heads
[4:04:58] <god__of__lore> Taskmaster can‚Äôt even remember his own daughter cuz of that memory sgot
[4:05:01] <Coystick> Task Manager is tracking your CPU usage AS WE SPEAK
[4:05:05] <pectusumbra> so taskmaster is a weaker Medaka
[4:05:06] <themightyseptopus> this is like the 'sneaking' in MGR
[4:05:06] <+Schrodingers_Box> Photographic Reflexes
[4:05:09] <gyrogogozeppeli> Captain Leotard PogChamp
[4:05:13] <CrimsonGargoyle> o shit captain leotard is pretty good LUL
[4:05:13] <$MightyMaxT> Wait, so Taskmaster basically can unlock gates of Chakra like Rock Lee to so the superhuman stuff?
[4:05:14] <Habblewater> Because he's got sick poisonranas
[4:05:23] <Coystick> It's between Arkham and Revegence TBH
[4:05:28] <SPidERMan8576> yeah in the udon manga
[4:05:30] <+Schrodingers_Box> Hes Rock Lee with the Sharingan
[4:05:39] <extradopeness> Capt. Leotard for Smash
[4:05:40] <%shen4u> I hope this cutscene gets the bugged version
[4:05:42] <%altairibnlaahad909> to be fair the sneaking in revengeance is actually kinda robust
[4:05:42] <+Schrodingers_Box> and Tentens tool belt
[4:05:42] <Habblewater> he's gonna butt chug it
[4:05:48] <EMP_Ike_Turner> he wants to get stronger
[4:05:49] <+Gravity_Gunner> Spider-Man punched a woman? Not in this game! No gang in New York City has a single woman for a member from what I‚Äôve seen.
[4:05:50] <gyrogogozeppeli> Mini Tombstone
[4:05:51] <SeventyForce> @MightyMaxT Kind of, he would just die after performing it
[4:05:51] <AlasterAngelo> thats a bit much biker guy
[4:05:51] <+TheBigO75> ALCHEMAX!!

[4:08:47] <+zabemareu> surprised pat doesn't have skip puzzles on.
[4:08:51] <Ge3b0t> super power drugs are nasty
[4:08:56] <MonsterEnvy> @AngriestPat Should note that Tombstone 's whiteness is unlreated to his powers. He his an Albino
[4:09:02] <+srkAres> man, good thing these puzzles are ACTUALLY for babies LUL

[4:09:22] <XdaXcaptainX> YOUR WIZARD HAS TEMPORARY INVULNERABILITY
[4:09:23] <CrimsonGargoyle> this would be super useful when falling offa building or something
[4:09:26] <AtlasMcCoy> Would you rather have 10 seconds of invulnerability or 0 seconds

[4:09:29] <supersparta333> I mean, 10 seconds of invincibility is pretty damn strong
[4:09:35] <ThighsSupreme> Tombstone is the best
[4:09:37] <AntChodeny> 10 seconds is enough... in the frozen time that is!
[4:09:38] <Habblewater> So do Nitrous canisters but people huff that shit like it's going out of fashion
[4:09:38] <+imextremelymanly> you could do a lot f damage in ten seconds
[4:09:39] <Vanllin> I guess it's designer meth at least. top quality
[4:09:42] <+Bobato_Chaps> yeah but imagine falling off a building an taking a hit before you die
[4:09:50] <+Bobato_Chaps> ten seconds is long enough
