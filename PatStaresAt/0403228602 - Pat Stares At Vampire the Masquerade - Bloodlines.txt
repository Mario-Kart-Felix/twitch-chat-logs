[0:00:20] <%Reizie_Etherealm> <<IT'S TIME>>
[0:00:23] <+nictron90> Oh, Pat, if you didn't know, the game has kind of a memory leak type thing that, instead of making the game crash, eventually causes it to just start spawning the wrong things in the wrong place, if you like, go into your apartment and see a car where a painting should be, exit the game and restart to fix it

[0:07:53] <%templar010> That would be very strong
[0:07:54] <+risenchudjr> Edward was a lame toreador
[0:07:55] <corepool> MMMMM BELLA my dear
[0:07:55] <Senselessvirus> @AngriestPat there is literally a antagonist vampire that's like that
[0:07:55] <+Ell1ot> why doesn't he talk like that? he's from that era
[0:07:55] <%TheDullaMAN> No, just him!
[0:07:56] <%SuperSonichu> twilight is literally an entire movie series about how ficking boring toreador are
[0:07:57] <+Parrish_broadnax> Just make them all DI
[0:07:57] <gustavozxd> EVERYONE!? yeyeyeye
[0:07:57] <%templar010> That is a strong idea
[0:07:57] <Sonokamome> Wow and Pat said he'd *never* *EVER* do a stream of VTMB
[0:07:57] <%Ilpala271> I dunno Pat that sounds like not respecting the artist's direction
[0:07:58] <Bouldus> epic vampire movie?
[0:07:59] <%jiin6> Campy voices would not save Twighlight
[0:07:59] <energywarning> but that would be easy mode for the twilight series. it's not the author's intention.

[0:08:27] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 funny story. When edward cullen was researching his role on twilight, he thought edward was a creepy stalker, so he played him as such. The fangirls ate it up anyway. He's also good friends with the guy who plays Ron Weasley.

[0:11:02] <KatabolicRage> dude no, clan quest mod is not for newbies
[0:11:03] <%LtSergei> unfortunately the basic patch isn't as basic as it should be
[0:11:05] <Mnightshyamallama> @AngriestPat this is funny to hear from you since people have been telling you that FOR YEARS!!!
[0:11:06] <Peculiar_Pangolin> It's not the plus patch
[0:11:07] <Picia000123> Fuck I hope GOG never goes out of buisness
[0:11:10] <%jiin6> GoG do good stuff at times
[0:11:10] <%Exyoh> The added content is pretty good, but you can tell when it's added in
[0:11:10] <tinypouf> plus patch is bad for a first playthrough anyway
[0:11:11] <ToneBacas> yep. GOG take huge pride in doing what they can to make games just work straight out of the installer
[0:11:11] <mrcharleytheplant> Yeah no backgrounds in the base GoG release
[0:11:11] <+Parrish_broadnax> I dont know what everyone Likes the game so Im here

[0:12:22] <+TastySammiches> @bigfado287 begone from this place, child
[0:12:23] <gustavozxd> that sounds fine
[0:12:24] <+runegod20> it was like the first source game ever completed
[0:12:24] <%brickwall35> Pat that's just how vampires stand
[0:12:24] <filialpails> T-posing is therapeutic
[0:12:24] <Dio_TR> Play Personality Test PAT
[0:12:25] <mayorrev> T T T T T T TT

[0:12:27] <+Toppunchpoopbob> T pose was the intended poses Kappa
[0:12:28] <%laserbeaming> They were showinng dominance
[0:12:29] <+Zerodyne90> what has this got do with the game?
[0:12:29] <KatabolicRage> that sounds like vanilla vtmb

[0:12:31] <Peculiar_Pangolin> The patch fixes all that
[0:12:32] <%lewdskeletor13> They were asserting dominance
[0:12:32] <%GohanEgret> T_T
[0:12:33] <%supersugoisenpai1> T pose to assert dominance
[0:12:33] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Just like a real Vampire tabletop session
[0:12:33] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Sounds like a bad creepypasta
[0:12:34] <%daisyyyy> my ex lost a save to a bug where she couldnt fight the asian vampire
[0:12:35] <%0dokuro> make all the vampire thralls
[0:12:35] <+nictron90> They T-posed to assert their dominance over the game itself
[0:12:36] <Sonokamome> @ScreamingMeat It's because they're taught through feelings :3
[0:12:36] <+Parrish_broadnax> Hard Sold I'm in
[0:12:37] <stabbityrabbit> Holy shit. That's a terrifying hospital.
[0:12:37] <AMajorTom> Gamers are so demanding these days
[0:12:37] <Sonokamome> lol

[0:12:47] <%machshop> but can you still have sex with vampires if it's broken
[0:12:48] <CandideCamera> Would you say that the difficulty of the patch was high

[0:12:58] <%SuperSonichu> PROTIP: If you want to be a bullshit melee character play a gangrel fist fighter and max the shapeshifting power line
[0:12:58] <%Reizie_Etherealm> So it's the kind of game that doesn't allow you to get from A to B upon release, got it
[0:12:59] <%jiin6> T posing kills vampires

[0:16:47] <MarylandJutsu> how is Paige today?
[0:16:49] <%cvp5127> yea elitism

[0:16:56] <$jacob2pop> hello, am I on time or super late
[0:17:00] <%SuperSonichu> i hit the first real genichiro fight today and I keep getting sekirowned
[0:17:01] <%Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[0:17:02] <jessicaamado> WHAT
[0:17:04] <%FrustratedAF> easy mode "starts" with the dragonrot Kappa
[0:17:06] <%0dokuro> The statue of limitations has well expired
[0:17:06] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Except a everytime you die, the game reminds you that you're playing on easy mode Kappa
[0:17:07] <Bouldus> dwarf barb Kappa
[0:17:09] <jijipose> Open it Pat, you coward
[0:17:09] <%tyler274> @NotGran you bet it is
[0:17:10] <%LtSergei> is Pat unspoiled on Bloodlines?
[0:17:10] <+The_Hand> why cant you just no clip and beat the final boss in sekiro lol. make it accesable
[0:17:10] <jessicaamado> WHAT WHAT WHAT OMG
[0:17:12] <+Zerodyne90> dwarf
[0:17:13] <zedravan> halfling
[0:17:13] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Rogue
[0:17:14] <%Kirby_Sauce> @cvp5127 suffer not the xeno. Suffer not the heretic
[0:17:16] <person181> make pat a monk
[0:17:17] <Gorgen> tomatoKiss
[0:17:17] <%acediamonds> Pat would play Druid
[0:17:18] <Bouldus> nah dwarf barbarian
[0:17:19] <Mr_Strut> Berzerker obviously
[0:17:19] <%supersugoisenpai1> Sorcerer
[0:17:21] <%0dokuro> Warlock
[0:17:21] <bluebiscuit94> good choices
[0:17:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> @jacob2pop Super late
[0:17:22] <Fujiwara_92> Archer rouge6
[0:17:23] <%jiin6> Easy mode, but the game refers you as a game journalist
[0:17:24] <%tyler274> 14 is the best final fantasy in a long time
[0:17:24] <SchlongKongEduardo> atpQuestion
[0:17:24] <mrcharleytheplant> Go back to basic D&D and pick dwarf
[0:17:25] <AMajorTom> The easy button should turn Sekiro into a Mario Bros. style platformer
[0:17:25] <+Ace5335> No big strong man pat
[0:17:26] <Croetec> dick ass theif
[0:17:26] <@commanderclaw> @AngriestPat What about Arcane Trickster Rogue?
[0:17:28] <lizard0tm> I've never played this game, but I hear it's kinda neato
[0:17:28] <+SasquatchMain> Warlock so he can sell his soul for power
[0:17:29] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Both are fucking coward classes lol
[0:17:29] <+CuddlyKaiju> good to see we're boiling a legit discussion down to a joke because the gaming community is toxic as shit
[0:17:30] <$jacob2pop> damn
[0:17:30] <jessicaamado> HE will play VTMB?! i can't belive
[0:17:31] <dark_pockets> Top tier wizard
[0:17:31] <Bouldus> clearly a Dwarf Berserker Barbarian
[0:17:31] <+Caffieantedjedi> Warlock. Sell your soul for more time on the clock
[0:17:33] <Picia000123> Just invest into Obfuscate and you're good
[0:17:35] <ToneBacas> journalist mode would be stupid since they'd be reviewing what would be essentially a different game
[0:17:35] <+Bad1uck> Barbarian of course, so he can rage all day
[0:17:36] <DougintheTrench> Wizard always gotta have the magic.
[0:17:37] <+collapsedVigil> Pat would be Warlock do he could cheat his way to magic power
[0:17:40] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Lood
[0:17:41] <%TheShortSwede> heeeey guys the Swede is here!
[0:17:48] <jessicaamado> i'm in shock!
[0:17:49] <GreyFoxHoundDD> Pact of the blade Warlock
[0:17:49] <%king_wragles> @commanderclaw you mean useful sorcerer ?
[0:17:50] <%bread_assassin> That's shocking, because you seem to play as a warrior class in most games
[0:17:52] <%Typhaeon> 20 is superhuman yeah
[0:17:52] <Bouldus> no
[0:17:54] <romanticzomedy> Twitch chat ain't the place for a legitimate discussion on anything, jack
[0:17:55] <pectusumbra> i'm sorry WHAT
[0:17:55] <%0dokuro> No, its much more
[0:17:55] <%Kirby_Sauce> 29
[0:17:55] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@acediamonds) (warning)
[0:17:57] <Fujiwara_92> 29 wtf
[0:17:58] <+runegod20> warlocks sells their souls for power when they can spend it on valuable time on the clock
[0:17:59] <+Tokanova> we must go higher
[0:17:59] <PowerfulBlackGangs> 20 is Captain America
[0:17:59] <%salty_syd913> how 29
[0:17:59] <Mrbaconator> 20 is a giant yes
[0:18:00] <%salty_syd913> how
[0:18:00] <%Typhaeon> But not quite giant level
[0:18:01] <$SGrim> 29 if fucked rooKek
[0:18:01] <TruTrashMan> Borderlands 3's easiest mode should replace enemy guns with bubble guns and have melee enemies Carne you but without the horrible aftermath (btw episode today was rad)
[0:18:02] <%PharosOfLight> Hey Pat, I subbed but I didn't see how to put in a message. So happy to finally see you playing this. Don't play a Malkavian for the love of all things!

[0:18:10] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 18m 12s.
[0:18:11] <+CaptainSama> oh you're playing bloodrayne the novel
[0:18:12] <%VanaSkiller> IS BLUUUUUD
[0:18:18] <%acediamonds> apologies
[0:18:19] <+brakkathoom> Wanted to see this every shitstorm. So happy it's happening now!
[0:18:19] <+ProfessorDetective052996> At least in Fifth Edition D&D. 30 is the god-level hard cap.
[0:18:26] <%lewdskeletor13> ISSS BLUD
[0:18:26] <TheViltsuZ> Did you see that new Forbes article?
[0:18:26] <+wwwwwww1> hill giant is just a 3/3
[0:18:28] <+WorldsBestPanda> 21 is hill giant
[0:18:28] <%AbezethTelos> @CaptainSama Clever.
[0:18:31] <Bailey__gaming> @supersonichu I can't beat the ape, his 2nd phase I find no time to hit him ever, can't get the parry down
[0:18:31] <%Teintstein> How much is Bloodlines like Blade?
[0:18:34] <%RogueCrocodile> Isss blyat
[0:18:35] <worldbrand> I hope it's clean
[0:18:38] <olwe123> In 5 Edition D&D, 20(+5) is the highest a character can go with the use of magical means. 28–29 is a +9, Monsters with a STR of 29 are a Storm Giant and an Ancient Blue Dragon. Again this is only in 5 edition, other editions have different Monsters.
[0:18:39] <GreyFoxHoundDD> 29 might be enough to punch the planet you are on and do the Megaton kirby mini game
[0:18:40] <jessicaamado> @AngriestPat why u playing this? I wonder
[0:18:41] <Bouldus> 20 in str isnt as amazing as it was in older editions
[0:18:42] <%Kyma1020> @angriestpat not if you’re a barbarian
[0:18:43] <%kiiiirsten> Spend it on PAT

[0:18:48] <Coystick> meeeeee

[0:18:49] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Spend it on RED BULL
[0:18:50] <timetraveller2000> Has pat played this before?
[0:18:51] <%SuperSonichu> SuperSonichu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Pat you horrible orange hobgoblin I am on break and cannot watch the whole stream but VtmB rules and I hope you like it. Don't open it.
[0:18:51] <%acediamonds> @Teintstein Masquerade chases Blade hard

[0:19:15] <%sshen> Did pat see people getting trade banned cause of that new kubrow precept in warframe?

[0:28:06] <+AlastorSlain> @angriestpat gangrel is old world of darkness they dont use it anymore
[0:28:10] <%LtSergei> Open it!
[0:28:11] <BigHugs> Don't open it.

[0:28:13] <BorkchopSlamwiches> brujah is good. tremere is favorite
[0:28:14] <gustavozxd> DONT OPEN IT
[0:28:16] <$Brother_Coduss> I wonder what clans we'll be able to play in 2
[0:28:19] <%Arxel1> "Dont open it" - Mystical Dude, 2019
[0:28:20] <%acediamonds> @AlastorSlain they're bringing it back for V5
[0:28:23] <%Solidnick18> firecrackers BlessRNG
[0:28:23] <Peculiar_Pangolin> Brujah is the most boring clan
[0:28:26] <eatdapancakes> On the plus side, he can be in the next WWE game without the 'property of White Wolf' warning now
[0:28:28] <TruTrashMan> I didn't expect you to be able to parry the bull but here we are
[0:28:28] <steelmorrigan> So it's down to a Ventrue/Brujah/Tremere Run at this rate
[0:28:30] <worldbrand> you're both
[0:28:31] <DougintheTrench> Open it so I can laugh at you.
[0:28:32] <+SolidusRex> DON'T OPEN IT
[0:28:32] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Toreador is most boring
[0:28:33] <+collapsedVigil> (Dont't) Open it Pat
[0:28:33] <+AlastorSlain> @acediamonds really?
[0:28:35] <+PenmanLupine> your doing both
[0:28:36] <%CappuccinoGuil> You do both
[0:28:38] <braincraft> I mean, you fight vampires too.
[0:28:38] <%LtSergei> @AlastorSlain keep up dude they brought back the old world of darkness for volume 5
[0:28:39] <Mr_Strut> You DO fight vampires
[0:28:40] <+King_of_Karp> I mean you also fight vampires too
[0:28:40] <Covil91> You still fight many vampires
[0:28:41] <+PenmanLupine> Vampires always kill other vampires
[0:28:42] <thelonechris> But you also fight them
[0:28:42] <worldbrand> Apply pressure
[0:28:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Brother_Coduss I bet one clan will sparkle in the sun like diamonds.
[0:28:48] <Nefarious_Niblet> I always thought Brujah were lackluster compared to other clans
[0:28:50] <%lewdskeletor13> Yeah I know nothing about this game
[0:28:52] <+generalve> WAIT FUCKIGN WEHAT ?
[0:28:52] <%Solidnick18> lol
[0:28:52] <braincraft> It's not like being a human in a game means you don't fight humans.
[0:28:54] <%Edgy_Macaroon> you fight everything Pat
[0:28:55] <Kefkaisnotamused> Malkie is definitely the most... peculiar.

[0:28:56] <+generalve> hes palying this ?!
[0:28:58] <+theneosloth> toreador has one of the better bullet time mechanics out of any game, how is that boring
[0:28:58] <%acediamonds> @AlastorSlain V5 goes back to the old World of Darkness. Unfortunately the Chronicles lines got the shaft
[0:28:59] <BunnyEmperor> Yeah, dont play like Pat LUL
[0:28:59] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat well you're a vampire fighting vampires....and weird shark demons.....and people.....and werewolves.....
[0:29:03] <+Jhylla81> It's hard for me to watch tv now since one of the WWE wrestlers is a classmate of mine
[0:29:06] <ThatManSam> I can't believe after years of this game being the most requested game on the reddit thread that he's actually going to play it. What a coward
[0:29:09] <RyanGelatin> ive been wondering what the fuck this game even is and why so many people like it
[0:29:13] <%Solidnick18> Play a vampire
[0:29:14] <worldbrand> Dont go for posture, hug his right arm (the non-burning one) and block his stomps. Get the fire umbrella
[0:29:14] <+Jhylla81> *wrestling

[0:50:35] <+Zerodyne90> mmmmhh
[0:50:36] <KatabolicRage> intimidate is pretty bad tbh
[0:50:38] <%kitkat668> seduce them all

[0:50:49] <%Exyoh> Int or Sub, depending on if you want to scare or fuck people into agreement
[0:50:49] <almostgotpitted> I recognize these stats
[0:50:49] <%Omegaanimus> Pat, have you ever given thought to the concept of oblivion and whether or not our existence is dependent on a sleeping blind idiot god at the center of everything?
[0:50:49] <Fujiwara_92> INTIMIDATION IS BAD
[0:50:49] <derap41> dodge is shit
[0:50:50] <kylejefferies> Yeah seduction, get your Vampire dick wet with the blood.
[0:50:51] <timetraveller2000> Seduction, eh? Kappa
[0:50:52] <Noctred192> NOOOOO
[0:50:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> Seduction and Intimidate suck
[0:50:53] <Jontman42> Count Patular? Really?
[0:50:55] <Peculiar_Pangolin> Dodge helps with all damage types
[0:50:56] <%thebetterbard> Intimidation has only one option that actually works in the game
[0:50:56] <kylejefferies> cause you are a messy drinker.
[0:50:57] <+theneosloth> you won't get a lot of opportunities to use intimidation
[0:50:58] <%gus_hornblende> i misheard that as "boy damage"
[0:50:58] <corepool> you need to succ
[0:50:58] <lizard0tm> Seduce AND THEN BLOODSPLODE THEM
[0:50:59] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> What I like that Count Patular is this dude's name before he became a vampire

[0:51:07] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Is the blood of the dead poisonous to Masquerade vampires?
[0:51:07] <SharkitYu> @AngriestPat brawl is the only useful thing there since it let you suck blood from enemies during combat
[0:51:07] <NewWaveMasquerade> Intimidation and Dodge!
[0:51:08] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Feeding
[0:51:08] <TopLeftCenter> @angriestpat mousing over feats on the right might help you decide stuff
[0:51:09] <KatabolicRage> like there are comparatively few oppertunities to use intimidate compared to the other two social feats
[0:51:12] <HeavyMetalIceCream> do the nasty pat!
[0:51:12] <pisshound87> dodge and guns
[0:51:13] <+Parrish_broadnax> you cant brawl you weak AF

[0:51:17] <jerobees> Dodge/sub
[0:51:17] <kylejefferies> Make your stand Gun.
[0:51:18] <Bouldus> intimidate
[0:51:20] <romanticzomedy> Why would it upset me that people pre ordered a game they're excited for
[0:51:22] <%ScreamingMeat> IF """"""BioWare"""""" ever makes another game after the Anthem DISASTER and IF Dragon Age 4 is good. I really hope they bring back Blood Magic and make it super good
[0:51:22] <cacophanes> dodge and either brawl or sub

[0:52:11] <%Solidnick18> that's all the time

[0:52:13] <almostgotpitted> Scholarship what is is game
[0:52:13] <gypsystranger> 3
[0:52:13] <+idyota> scholarship is fine
[0:52:15] <%Tyonidus> SO what the heck is this game? Don't think I've ever seen gameplay
[0:52:15] <Peculiar_Pangolin> Haggle is useless. Money is easy to come by
[0:52:16] <corepool> we're helping?
[0:52:17] <%ScreamingMeat> Blood Magic is probably my favorite type of magic in fantasy
[0:52:17] <a1u5> You'll NEED Brawl at some point, trust me
[0:52:18] <%nmaten> put it all in luck
[0:52:18] <Fujiwara_92> TAKE DODGE
[0:52:18] <+Marvelous_Miscreant> Chat is so fast tdogSad
[0:52:19] <Bouldus> intimidate
[0:52:19] <%El_Desperad0> Don't listen to chat
[0:52:19] <KatabolicRage> Intimidate is really bad, do not take intimidate
[0:52:19] <%thebetterbard> Sub
[0:52:20] <+Grayhammatter> dodge though
[0:52:20] <%LtSergei> you probably want some defence my man
[0:52:20] <%brakkathoom> all in scholarship
[0:52:20] <lizard0tm> Ye
[0:52:21] <%Exyoh> Scholarship's good!
[0:52:22] <%thebetterbard> 2
[0:52:23] <%RedSharkHC> subterfuge
[0:52:23] <KeystoneA1> Security is needed to lockpick shit, it's important
[0:52:23] <+Parrish_broadnax> sub
[0:52:24] <PKHTjim> Intimidation / Subterfuge?
[0:52:24] <SolSwagGuy56> Bang Bang Bang pull my vampire trigger
[0:52:26] <+nictron90> One point of dodge isn't a bad idea
[0:52:26] <+Mickerus> Brawl is good, for feeding
[0:52:27] <$PulverKong> All your tremere spells are basically gun replacements..don't get guns
[0:52:27] <Bouldus> yea sub and intim
[0:52:27] <simulationbard> Oh boy people are arguing about RPG builds
[0:52:28] <%TheDullaMAN> Dodge and Intimidate
[0:52:29] <lizard0tm> Subterfuge
[0:52:30] <grayjammer> My youthful soul is filled with PISS
[0:52:30] <%mister___doctor> Alright everyone let's Boo Pat
[0:52:31] <nobody12349> Pat channel your raw sexual energy
[0:52:31] <%mh9s> subterfuge of the two
[0:52:31] <%Exyoh> Subterfuge over intimidation
[0:52:31] <stabbityrabbit> That's actually really silly.
[0:52:32] <pisshound87> if you dont want a combat one subterfuge comes up a lot
[0:52:32] <%LtSergei> no he wont
[0:52:32] <Peculiar_Pangolin> No you don't
[0:52:33] <+King_of_Karp> seduction isn't good on a male character
[0:52:33] <%mister___doctor> Booooooooo
[0:52:33] <%spiritofmojave> I just want to see you play this, I don't give a shit sugoiBestgirl
[0:52:34] <steelmorrigan> lol
[0:52:35] <+runegod20> suberfuge is worthless
[0:52:35] <%lewdskeletor13> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[0:52:35] <%Cavumentum> Intimidation is practically useless
[0:52:36] <salstrane> brawl helps with feeding
[0:52:36] <KatabolicRage> Intimdate will get used like twice in the entire game you don't want it
[0:52:36] <mrcharleytheplant> You don't
[0:52:36] <%StEmlosWater> people have fucking opinions on this game, it seems
[0:52:36] <%thebetterbard> apatRaffle
[0:52:36] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Brawl lets you feed
[0:52:36] <+nictron90> Brawl is used f or feeding on people in combat @AngriestPat
[0:52:36] <lizard0tm> LUL
[0:52:39] <axivate_> subterfuge is a nombo with your shitty charisma
[0:52:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> NBo you won't
[0:52:41] <%waifoong98> just pick randomly Kappa
[0:52:41] <romanticzomedy> Brawl/Sub~
[0:52:41] <derap41> Game forces melee sometimes
[0:52:42] <+Marvelous_Miscreant> Subterfuge sounds good tdogRat
[0:52:43] <SharkitYu> @AngriestPat you need points in brawl to suck blood from enemies during combat is pretty useful
[0:52:43] <jijipose> lies
[0:52:44] <+Dives__> You don't need brawl if you stock up on ammo
[0:52:44] <%brakkathoom> seduction is good for grabbing some blood from bar skanks
[0:52:45] <Peculiar_Pangolin> Brawl is only good for gangrels
[0:52:46] <mrgrimsmiles> no
[0:52:46] <cacophanes> intimidation is kinda useless
[0:52:46] <dzdandcnfsd> you have dominate you dont need brawl to feed
[0:52:46] <%SydSavage> you've got blood magic, brawl is or suckers
[0:52:46] <KeystoneA1> Brawl and dodge
[0:52:47] <$megamonmon123> so many lies
[0:52:47] <mrcharleytheplant> You can just feed on people willingly
[0:52:47] <Covil91> Ignore chat, they're dumb
[0:52:47] <%0dokuro> Brawl and Stealth
[0:52:47] <DracaenaLeaf> You'll need everything at some point etc
[0:52:48] <corepool> you don't need it but it helps
[0:52:48] <Sitromxe> Dodging is universally useful.
[0:52:49] <+Parrish_broadnax> you have no strength
[0:52:50] <nobknee> @DSD24 Yeah, I'd be a bit more understandin' if it had some gameplay footage. But man, it's a sequel to a 16-year-old game with a 90-dollar big dick bundle preorder. That's shitty.
[0:52:50] <%RedSharkHC> subterfuge gives you the free blood from the ladies
[0:52:53] <%lewdskeletor13> Do whatever you want!
[0:52:53] <%LtSergei> if you want to melee its good, but if you want to guns, its not
[0:52:54] <nekodelic> @angriestpat don't read chat, follow your vampiric heart
[0:52:58] <Covil91> brawl is trash
[0:52:59] <timetraveller2000> Honestly, establishing character stats is the most stressful parts of RPGs for me O_o
[0:52:59] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Seduction is used for blood dolls
[0:53:00] <%shotgang86> I think you need at least 1 point of brawl to feed during combat
[0:53:00] <ItsDeans> brawl is life honestly
[0:53:00] <Bouldus> oh rigght
[0:53:00] <%crimsonharvest> I'd say Melee and Security
[0:53:01] <Fujiwara_92> I'll stop reading chat, let pat his thing
[0:53:01] <%mh9s> so yeah go brawl or dodge
[0:53:02] <%OffKilta> this is def. not the place for discussing min/max builds
[0:53:02] <+Marvelous_Miscreant> Dumb like a fox 🦊
[0:53:03] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@collapsedVigil)
[0:53:03] <+twentysix_37> Patular not good at computas?
[0:53:03] <a1u5> Brawl is NEEDED when you use Auspex. It's a perfect combo
[0:53:04] <%0dokuro> so is Brawl though XD
[0:53:05] <%Docblargle> but if you're tremere your brawl won't be any good
[0:53:06] <$PulverKong> guns are super crap, you got spells that kick ass
[0:53:07] <SharkitYu> @AngriestPat if you wanna min max you need everything in int and scholarship so you can use skill books and have persuations the best for conversations, guns suck in the first area so level perception and firearms later and just use thaumaturgy
[0:53:08] <DeathIsABishi> combine brawl with blood heal to cheese everything
[0:53:08] <+SpectralShot> Seduction-only build
[0:53:09] <pisshound87> @AngriestPat a little brawl is good, you dont need much and can get it later tbh
[0:53:11] <+runegod20> free blood that you drink without people freaking out but it's not like blood is hard to get
[0:53:13] <CoolGuyEddy> @AngriestPat you have more than 3 points for abilities, look at the names of the trees
[0:53:14] <stabbityrabbit> @AngriestPat You can raise your charisma though.
[0:53:15] <astrodart> pats vampire oc POG
[0:53:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> Melee and Security are Skills not Talents
[0:53:18] <%mister___doctor> Why isn't the funny man arguing with the funny girl isn't this a Pat Stares At Stream
[0:53:18] <thetruthofyourbeing> you do you bud
[0:53:19] <derap41> Brawl and/or melee
[0:53:22] <salstrane> Dominate is also used in dialogue
[0:53:23] <Jontman42> Is every single expert of this game in the chat tonight?
[0:53:25] <%Tyonidus> Tyonidus subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 1 month streak! ayyyeee look at that, 6 months of shaking the bag
[0:53:27] <+Tiddlebonk> @AngriestPat Tremere use their magic to get around dialogue checks, I think. Or maybe that's Malkavians. It's been so long since I've played this game, hahaha.
[0:53:33] <$PulverKong> @mister___doctor the funny girl is out of town
[0:53:33] <%Remery_> Pat's not being a slutty manipulative vampire? O.O
[0:53:36] <+MrRabbles> damage is rough in this game take a dodge

[1:53:13] <FelicityC> fuckin dennis..
[1:53:18] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Ghoul is a cushy gig, but you're a hopeless addict
[1:53:20] <+Shadicara> Ghouls are pussies kill him
[1:53:20] <Croetec> Fuck no it isn't
[1:53:21] <SchlongKongEduardo> uhhhhhhh
[1:53:22] <Peculiar_Pangolin> It has some downsides
[1:53:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> except youre a slave to the master
[1:53:22] <+Dives__> Make your addicted tho
[1:53:23] <KatabolicRage> being a ghoul does make you a slave to your blood sugar daddy
[1:53:24] <+AlastorSlain> reall addictive
[1:53:24] <+nictron90> It kinda makes you a slave to the dude who feeds you his blood
[1:53:24] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat no longer wishes to be a toilet, he now desires to be a vampire remora eel
[1:53:24] <count_bob> Except you're an addict?
[1:53:24] <Croetec> Fucking slave
[1:53:24] <+Xanezz> yeah it fuckin does
[1:53:25] <shhzombies> its not its like being addicted to blood
[1:53:25] <+ShadowArcangel> There's a BIG downside
[1:53:25] <thelonechris> No it's not
[1:53:25] <mrcharleytheplant> Besides basically being a slave
[1:53:26] <%JenovasPuppet> Just gotta how your vamp master is cool.
[1:53:26] <+R4dishh> not really
[1:53:27] <%Niney_Who> Pat it's like super meth
[1:53:28] <+DespondentSloth> You kind of become a slave though
[1:53:29] <bluebiscuit94> you're also a fucking addict
[1:53:29] <%dukenux> DENNIS system
[1:53:29] <TwinBat> lol pat you'll see
[1:53:29] <%mh9s> except youre a slave to your vamp pusher
[1:53:29] <+Xanezz> id be a ghoul
[1:53:30] <+risenchudjr> Yeah... except you are involved in shit WAAAAAAY over your head. Ghouls die ALOT
[1:53:30] <KeystoneA1> It can be as long as your master isn't too much of an evil asshole
[1:53:30] <+MrMcCrabby> ghoul is very much not, being an actual vampire is loads better
[1:53:31] <%shotgang86> help him
[1:53:31] <derap41> No cause you're a drug slave
[1:53:32] <Middyddim> other than being some vamp's little bitch
[1:53:32] <+PaladinGuy1986> Pat wants to be a ghoul confirmed
[1:53:32] <%TheBigO75> YOu'd be addicted Pat
[1:53:33] <EnemyViolent> Except vampires will eventually decide their ghouls aren't worth it any more and just kill them
[1:53:33] <CptBritches> Ghouls are essentially drug addicts
[1:53:35] <+justianxix> Pat's immortality is getting closer
[1:53:35] <%CerberusDriver> Vampire blood is super addictive and you become a slave
[1:53:35] <+Shadicara> Ghoul is just a cucked vampire pat
[1:53:36] <A_Red_Robot> Being a ghoul basically makes you a vamp blood drug addict
[1:53:36] <+JavaManJoJo> you still gotta drink blood and blood tastes bad
[1:53:36] <%Exyoh> Not when your vamp boss is an asshole
[1:53:37] <%OffKilta> well aside from the crippling blood addiction
[1:53:37] <%spiritofmojave> you're a slave jobber underling tho
[1:53:38] <+sordcooper> being a ghouls is great, until you realize that you're basically a vampire's drug slave
[1:53:39] <Zer0beats> what do you mean YOU PEOPLE?
[1:53:39] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat apart from the CRIPPLING ADDICITION to vamp blood making you a slave you mean?
[1:53:39] <Parapattern> But then you're called a ghoul
[1:53:39] <+King_of_Karp> ghouls are basically just drug addicts
[1:53:40] <%dukenux> yeah, not aging is sweet enough
[1:53:40] <+zaworldo> you pEOPLE?!
[1:53:40] <+ProfessorDetective052996> But if you can't your fix, you slowly wither away.
[1:53:44] <AngelYoumou> @Crankypancake they'd be echoing if he had it on. Mercurio's Audio is just weird
[1:53:44] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, you can get your own ghoul. Let's see what you think when that happens XD
[1:53:45] <%ShogunNoonto> so how do you become a vamp ?
[1:53:47] <+zaworldo> give him the estrogen
[1:53:49] <yourliteraldog> Pet slime ball to a presumably hot sex monster. Eh I've worked worse jobs
[1:53:49] <%Remery_> dick leaks!
[1:53:50] <+risenchudjr> get him some morphine
[1:53:50] <byobuer> give him the estrogen!
[1:53:51] <natebud> How about Estrogen?
[1:53:51] <$TheCrispyBoi> they're slaves, dude
[1:53:52] <+PaladinGuy1986> he's graduated from toilet seat to ghoul
[1:53:53] <+R4dishh> NO SNITCHING
[1:53:53] <NewWaveMasquerade> No, a Ghoul's life blows, Their servants to Vampires.
[1:53:53] <timetraveller2000> It’s basically like being a heroin addict. So no great
[1:53:54] <jijipose> Give him estrogen
[1:53:55] <%captain_history> not really because being a ghoul means being enslaved to a vampire, because you are addicted to its blood
[1:53:56] <+runegod20> ghouls can still go out during the day, right? i forget
[1:54:00] <GarosTepes> Ghouls can walk in daylight so they will always be useful.
[1:54:03] <SharkitYu> @AngriestPat go to the hospital first

[2:02:33] <+nictron90> Pat there's a bit of a bug in the game, you can buy multiple copies of a book if you don't close out of the menu after buying it (but most books can only raise skills up to a certain level)
[2:02:33] <%Gogogolem> I don't remember how they work.
[2:02:33] <$Brother_Coduss> MAYBE

[2:10:09] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat The 60 year old guy would die but not her

[2:10:11] <+stagemage> wears off unless theyre super old
[2:10:11] <$Corporate_Redeemer> CAN BE ADDICTIVE
[2:10:11] <A_Red_Robot> Ghoul shit wears off, and all their aging catches up with them
[2:10:11] <pisshound87> @AngriestPat she is addicted but will get better

[2:10:13] <derap41> No it like a bad withdrawll
[2:10:13] <KeystoneA1> If you feed a ghoul your blood 3 times they become bound/addicted to you
[2:10:14] <arcaderabbit48> Its addictive, but it wears off over time
[2:10:15] <$PulverKong> she will move into your apartment and you can drink from her anytime
[2:10:15] <SchlongKongEduardo> @angriestpat too late now

[2:56:44] <%SaltyDongs> 3rd gen boivin
[2:56:44] <+runegod20> I think the radio stuff is a single like 15 minute long audio file, there's like 4 different version based on the point of the game

[2:59:23] <+palebluedots> Just like in real life
[2:59:25] <+Robopengy> Is Pat playing as a Nosferatu?
[2:59:25] <a1u5> Next door neighbor is the sexy cannibals
[2:59:26] <%kiiiirsten> LUL totally normal human hand
[2:59:27] <+runegod20> cause i 100% know tara's a main charater
[2:59:28] <%Keaton_x> I pee from my peeenis.
[2:59:29] <%mh9s> pat's bloody penis is between him and paige
[2:59:30] <+risenchudjr> Imalia
[2:59:30] <%JJCheeker> muh beenis
[2:59:30] <%Laecerelius> If you get it buy it from GoG. They have a lot of improvements pre-installed
[2:59:31] <%WackyGear> your hands are fugly
[2:59:33] <Dehlome> my blood penis is ALL POWERFUL
[2:59:33] <lambishly> those fingers look like pats
[2:59:33] <%LtSergei> Imalia
[2:59:34] <+TechnicolorNinja> I thought magic was for nerds, pat?
[2:59:35] <%Meme_Platinum> i mean aren't all penises blood penises?
[2:59:35] <cumurasame> ...huh I wonder if anyone made sexual mods for this game back in the day
[2:59:35] <Mrbaconator> so pat does that mean there IS blood in your semen?
[2:59:38] <californaya> Isn't any penis a blood penis?
[2:59:39] <%JenovasPuppet> Paige, get home soon. At this rate Pat is going to fuck Skelmo
[2:59:41] <AngelYoumou> Honestly, no streamer I've seen has chosen Tremere. They either pick Toreador or Malkavian....
[2:59:42] <twitchyal> Is this Anor Londor?
[2:59:42] <+runegod20> oh look, another foreshadow
[2:59:42] <gustavozxd> @myman10407 it's awesome, but either buy the GoG version or if you buy the steam version, download the fanmod that fixes the game
[2:59:44] <alrobot2014> @maskedriderhero he only goes out at night because otherwise his penis gets burned off
[2:59:46] <%shotgang86> Pat just hit F5 to quick save
[2:59:47] <+NickLeeVee> Would erectile dysfunction prevent the use of blood penis magic?
[2:59:48] <natebud> silver ring pat, laptop
[2:59:48] <%0dokuro> Thats not very cash money of you pat
[2:59:48] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Cthulu?

[2:59:49] <Tampaoster> on the tv
[2:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:50] <%LtSergei> thats that on the tv
[2:59:51] <PowerfulBlackGangs> There it is

[2:59:56] <Ion_Laser> @fairore no problem. Turns out she was the right hand to some sex cult leader on the east coast of the US
[2:59:58] <joneworldbeater> You need to go to Foxy Boxes ASAP
[3:00:06] <+NoGodsNoSenpais> I've got no clue what this game is but it looks like my favorite era of jank ass pc games
[3:00:06] <KeystoneA1> You can pump your Security
[3:00:06] <+pl0xzz> We just going to ignore the blood on the floor in the hallway?
[3:00:07] <gustavozxd> need to bloodbuff while lockpicking
[3:00:08] <lilmac64> @AngriestPat Reminder that it is canon to the table top lore that Vampires need to use blood magic to get it up.
[3:00:08] <Paradocks23> @nickleevee Other way around.
[3:00:09] <TRIGGER_M4N> is this a paradox game?
[3:00:12] <pisshound87> oh right, cause this is an Elysium or whatever
[3:00:13] <%Exyoh> Oh, yeah, top of TV?
[3:00:14] <%Laecerelius> Pat casts Bloodbutt. It's not very effective.
[3:00:14] <+risenchudjr> @AngelYoumou Tremere is busted as fuck. Probably the best clan in the game power-wse
[3:00:15] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> yeah that's a later game box
[3:00:16] <Enz0ned> Have you added any mods

[3:00:30] <@commanderclaw> @AngriestPat There's a ring you can sell on the table next to the laptop
[3:00:30] <+risenchudjr> @TRIGGER_M4N No, this was in 2004. Activision did this. The new one is paradox
[3:00:33] <AngelYoumou> @risenchudjr most people swear by Celerity.
[3:00:34] <%acediamonds> why have I not played a Tremere before?
[3:00:36] <californaya> Good ol' McGee

[3:05:02] <The_Butterfly_Man> @Frodus_Maximus LuL is it really

[3:05:02] <Demon_chann> @risenchudjr nice thats the lastest one
[3:05:03] <KatabolicRage> troika fell the fuck apart after this game

[3:05:09] <%lautalocos> troika doesnt exist anymore
[3:05:09] <Covil91> The writers are the important part.
[3:05:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Madbearv NO not the same writers
[3:05:10] <%mh9s> troika big ded
[3:05:10] <%acediamonds> if the writers are good, it's worth
[3:05:10] <+SolidusRex> Most of them
[3:05:11] <+sordcooper> same writes
[3:05:11] <EnemyViolent> It's made by the team that did Deadlight: Retribution
[3:05:11] <%BlitzNeidhart> Troika is super dead
[3:05:11] <romanticzomedy> same writers, though
[3:05:12] <%spiritofmojave> Troika is kill

[3:05:15] <SpaceGuntank> Troika got closed down some years back
[3:05:15] <Croetec> all the major players from Troika are working on sequel
[3:05:16] <%Laecerelius> Yeah, Troika died after making some amazing fucking RPGs
[3:05:16] <%Yokuho> It won't be good, it's western.
[3:05:16] <%lewdskeletor13> Same writers apparently

[3:05:19] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> this looks GREAT
[3:05:19] <mochill> troika died when this game came out
[3:05:19] <OldOnyx> troika has been dead for years
[3:05:20] <+AlastorSlain> it has the main people
[3:05:20] <+Arsene48> Some deverloper carried over
[3:05:20] <%0dokuro> same writers though
[3:05:21] <$PaleBloodInk> And the same lead composer, too.
[3:05:22] <lilmac64> Same writers AND composer.
[3:05:22] <%dukenux> Troika is long deceased
[3:05:24] <%daisyyyy> Same writers has me excited
[3:05:24] <%Exyoh> Boyarsky, Avellone & co. are apparently on @AngriestPat
[3:05:25] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Troika's a dead company, but has the same writers
[3:05:27] <Demon_chann> @AngriestPat the devs dont have the best history with games tho
[3:05:28] <imperatorshlemp> bloodlines 2 has the same music director
[3:05:29] <+runegod20> the walls are suppose to be old but they looks more bloody
[3:05:30] <twitchyal> @AngriestPat I made a photoshop ages ago under my NexusARC account where Woolie's face was a Kinect because of your comment of a Kinect with Dredds. I called it Kinectie Dredds man. Thank you for noticing me senpai.
[3:05:31] <CptBritches> Same writers and even Deb, the radio chick is coming back
[3:05:31] <+MrMcCrabby> its a completely different studio but they brought on a few people who originally worked on the game including the writer
[3:05:31] <KatabolicRage> you aint seen nefarious
[3:05:31] <SharkitYu> @AngriestPat they have some of the same writers

[3:05:33] <TwinBat> RING
[3:05:34] <AnacondaVirtue> The writer for VTMB 1 is returning, though, and he's getting help from Chris Avellone. Oh and the composer for this game is coming back too
[3:05:35] <%starotter70> Woolie's old apartment?
[3:05:37] <EnemyViolent> It's made by the team that did Blacklight: Retribution
[3:05:38] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Given how 90s WoD is, I don't trust it
[3:05:39] <caol2017> HANDS
[3:05:39] <Madbearv> the EDGE
[3:05:41] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat They got the main writers back I think
[3:05:42] <%FrostMass22> After the shit so far, I think it might not be good
[3:05:45] <+subdude_> Only one of the new writers worked on this.
[3:05:48] <pisshound87> ive lived worse places
[3:05:53] <+risenchudjr> I love this game - it's tone is all over the place. It goes from funny to horifying and it seems so natural

[3:08:10] <Madbearv> Thaumaturgy is legit the most powerful
[3:08:11] <+ProfessorDetective052996> Metal.

[3:34:58] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Werewolves are way stronger but only for like one night a month.
[3:34:59] <AnacondaVirtue> Werewolves have an even better regeneration ability and are inhumanly strong. They can also sidestep into another dimension
[3:34:59] <KeystoneA1> Vampires can kill werewolves, but werewolves are super strong
[3:35:00] <Edtango> monkaS
[3:35:01] <NewWaveMasquerade> Yes! Werewolves are serious shit kickers.

[3:41:24] <+schelmpki> @AngriestPat so one of the theories of why Malkavins are nuts is they access the memories of there bloodline and see the past and the future but have no control over it.

[3:41:47] <%acediamonds> Do you wanna summon Caine? Cus thinbloods are how ya summon Caine
[3:41:47] <%SaltyDongs> What I've doneeeeeeeeeeee
[3:41:47] <+ShadowArcangel> apparently you are a thin-blood in VTMB 2
[3:41:48] <+krawtch> is this what happens when a vampiric horse bites a british man
[3:41:49] <+jimmybeegood> but yeah he's likely Gangrel, Rosa is likely Malkavian
[3:41:49] <%QueequegTheater> surfer bro
[3:41:49] <%connos_livereview> Wonder what his thoughts on division 2 are
[3:41:51] <Kefkaisnotamused> Ugh, that mug

[3:41:57] <%laserbeaming> They are shitty vampires gone wrong
[3:42:00] <%JJCheeker> Kylo?
[3:42:00] <+dtogo> You start out as a thin blood in the new game they say
[3:42:01] <Demon_chann> You play as a thin blood on bloodline 2
[3:42:03] <godzookylives> Pahties
[3:42:07] <+Forticon> yeah you're gonna start VtMB2 as a thin-blood. seems silly to me
[3:42:07] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> side with the underclass vampires
[3:42:09] <Clyderso> "lilith"
[3:42:14] <+risenchudjr> @jimmybeegood Classless vamps, but worse. Caitiff are classless vamps who actually get some powers. Thin Bloods just get FUCKED
[3:42:15] <+JackMillerTime> oh damn
[3:42:17] <ColonelMustach> ah, fuck being a thin blood
[3:42:22] <%QueequegTheater> keep these lower class peons in their place
[3:42:27] <%laserbeaming> Oh, I'm now not interested in Bloodlines 2.
[3:42:27] <Fujiwara_92> Clan less Vampires are Caitff, Thin-blood is a vampire who's too far, bloodline wise from Cain @angriestpat
[3:42:28] <%acediamonds> Thin Bloods work super different in V5, I wouldn't be surprised if you played one in Bloodlines 2
[3:42:28] <%laserbeaming> damn
[3:42:30] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> :(
[3:42:32] <NeoOneShin> i don't want to be a thinblood, that's disgusting
[3:42:32] <TwinBat> BibleThump
[3:42:33] <$ooblagis> In VTMB2 you're a thin blood who somehow gets HAXed into becoming something more powerful
[3:42:34] <%brickwall35> :(
[3:42:35] <+ejn127> BibleThump
[3:42:37] <pisshound87> being a thinblood is fuckin rough
[3:42:40] <%InsaneJackLondon> BibleThump
[3:42:42] <strongweeb> crikey
[3:42:43] <darkslide44> Yo how late am i
[3:42:44] <lilmac64> As Vampires create more vampires, each new generation is weaker and has worse powers than the last. Thin bloods are vampires who are so far down the generational line that they barely have any powers at all.
[3:42:45] <valachi> @Forticon Well how else are they gonna make shitty class warfare commentary?
[3:42:46] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Oof
[3:42:48] <+jimmybeegood> I'm going to hazard a guess that Bloodlines 2 will retcon thinbloods
[3:42:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> weve been there bruh
[3:42:55] <darkslide44> When did he start
[3:42:55] <+risenchudjr> Diablerie is a hell of a drug. Just eat an older vmapire
[3:42:55] <KatabolicRage> thats how it goes in revised edition yes
[3:42:55] <SeaReally> ye
[3:42:56] <Meekest> Yes
[3:42:57] <Demon_chann> yeah
[3:43:00] <Fujiwara_92> yup
[3:43:01] <@commanderclaw> Yeah
[3:43:02] <%easternstealth> Too many generations down. I get it
[3:43:02] <Nemesis2098> yup
[3:43:03] <%Exyoh> All the drawbacks of vampirism with none of the benefits @AngriestPat
[3:43:04] <a1u5> Half vampire, all the curses, bairly any benefits
[3:43:04] <+risenchudjr> yeah, these guys are 14th gen or higher
[3:43:05] <+ToastyMozart> Yeah they're all shit-tier vamps
[3:43:06] <@Pandora_Prime> they're like 14th to 15th Generation
[3:43:06] <%acediamonds> I wouldn't be surprised if in Bloodlines 2, you get a bunch of Blood Alchemy
[3:43:07] <WorstCompany> Hey, just came in. It seems Pat’s hasn’t done the beach house combat bit yet
[3:43:10] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Legacy of Cain?
[3:43:11] <valachi> Bloodlines 2 runs on the version that nobody actually likes.
[3:43:12] <ColonelMustach> essentially 15th gen. Not human enough to be human, not vamp enough to be vamps
[3:43:13] <lilmac64> A vampire who doesn't know, or doesn't affiliate with his own clan is called a Caitiff.
[3:43:14] <$ooblagis> Every generation is weaker than the last. Cain is basically a God, Second Gen are Demi-Gods, and so on
[3:43:15] <NumbusPlays> so what if they just... got more vamp blood
[3:43:19] <%connos_livereview> my blood is thicc cos i have high bp
[3:43:20] <+dtogo> @ooblagis so thats not possible in this universe?
[3:43:20] <WorstCompany> But have I missed anything in particular?
[3:43:23] <Covil91> There are 13 generations I think? After 14 you're a thin blood
[3:43:24] <%Ravenian96> @AngriestPat They say you're a thin blood in Bloodlines 2
[3:43:25] <%PharosOfLight> Strength is determined by how many generations you are from Cain. You are... of a surprisingly close lineage.
[3:43:28] <JT137> yep
[3:43:28] <+jimmybeegood> Besides, the logical conclusion is that eventually everyone becomes a thinblood at some point
[3:43:29] <%mh9s> they are FUCKED
[3:43:30] <pisshound87> yeah its the worst
[3:43:31] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[3:43:31] <Demon_chann> yeah
[3:43:32] <+risenchudjr> yeaaaaaaah it sucks bad
[3:43:33] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> CURSED
[3:43:33] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Literal shittier
[3:43:34] <ape_hawk> yup
[3:43:34] <%dukenux> damn
[3:43:34] <Peculiar_Pangolin> They might be able to walk in the sun though
[3:43:37] <digaogrunge> not 0 benefits
[3:43:37] <+nictron90> It's inconsistent, some can apparently walk in the sun
[3:43:38] <fazoburquina> it's a real bad deal
[3:43:38] <Madbearv> because you're quite literally walking mistakes
[3:43:38] <%nmaten> and hes austrailian
[3:43:39] <Demon_chann> just the fucking worse
[3:43:40] <%acediamonds> Thinbloods don't get the worst. Don't they get to walk in the day?
[3:43:40] <%InsaneJackLondon> yup thats thinbloods for you
[3:43:40] <%LtSergei> i think they can handle sunlight a little better
[3:43:41] <KatabolicRage> thin bloods actually have slightly less weaknesses but they're still screwed
[3:43:41] <KeystoneA1> Not entirely. Some thin-bloods can stand the sun and eat food
[3:43:41] <D1rien> they can eat food right?
[3:43:42] <+krawtch> whats really terrible is this guy doesnt even own a shirt
[3:43:43] <gustavozxd> @Reizie_Etherealm oh yeah that's a vampire game too huh i forgot
[3:43:44] <+Hugpls> look at that face
[3:43:44] <%MagickBurritoh> Really?
[3:43:45] <NewWaveMasquerade> Yep! Being a thin blood sucks major balls.
[3:43:46] <Croetec> don't worry thinbloods get organized in v5
[3:43:46] <%ScreamingMeat> And the only way to "decrease" your generation is to feed on powerful vampires
[3:43:47] <+risenchudjr> BUT you can get out of it by eating an older vamp
[3:43:47] <+ToastyMozart> Pretty much. Plus getting targeted by way more dangerous vampires
[3:43:47] <Covil91> Nah, thin bloods can go in the sun. They just burn like an Irish
[3:43:47] <%crimsonharvest> You can upgrade your blood but it's hard
[3:43:47] <buffmurffy> some thin bloods can live in the sun though
[3:43:48] <Mr_Strut> Some can theoritically become human again
[3:43:50] <%Emperor_Bad> just get better blood
[3:43:50] <digaogrunge> they make their own disciplines
[3:43:53] <+runegod20> some have even been rumored to have kids they're so far from being real vampires
[3:43:56] <Madbearv> 14th/15th are a lot different in 5e
[3:43:57] <+risenchudjr> However, eating older vamps is a REAL big taboo
[3:43:57] <%connos_livereview> @nmaten LUL
[3:43:58] <%acediamonds> Daywalkers
[3:43:58] <%waifoong98> Just dump all you blood and steal somebody else Kappa
[3:44:00] <+MrMcCrabby> not only are you weak, the high class vampires see you as a sign of doom and hate you
[3:44:00] <KatabolicRage> lets not talk about v5 thin bloods, they work a bit differently
[3:44:02] <faegbeard> E
[3:44:03] <+ccwettr123> @AngriestPat supposedly lots of thin-bloods means the time of the apocalypse is coming according to vamp prophecy
[3:44:03] <Marco_Apollo> E
[3:44:04] <%luckysteak> !uptime
[3:44:04] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 44m.
[3:44:07] <+sordcooper> they get some weird powers as benifits, some can eat human food, some still breath and have basic human bodiily functions, and if your gen is low enough you can still have a child. . . a fucked up one
[3:44:07] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Diablerie confirmed for Bloodlines 2
[3:44:07] <natebud> At least they let me keep my boombox
[3:44:07] <Nemesis2098> thin bloods in new version are way better, more like weird alchemists and stuff
[3:44:08] <JT137> E
[3:44:09] <Marco_Apollo> eeeeeeeee
[3:44:10] <%CerberusDriver> @AngriestPat Thin Bloods can be Daywalkers, thats about it for benefits.
[3:44:10] <Marco_Apollo> E
[3:44:11] <pisshound87> some thin bloods can even have kids iirc
[3:44:11] <%acediamonds> V5 has some decent mechanics
[3:44:12] <%Laecerelius> E! In the coffee!
[3:44:14] <KatabolicRage> make sure you head up the pier man, you can permanently miss one of your quests up there
[3:44:17] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> it's the explanation for how you get to spec into a race of vampire instead of picking it from character creation
[3:44:18] <$ooblagis> @dtogo Not unless you chow down on a stronger vampire. And that's not a thing anyone who isn't a real blood and guts type of vampire ever does
[3:44:19] <NeoOneShin> Nah, they also lack some of thedrawbacks
[3:44:19] <%acediamonds> I may need to play a V5 Malk or Tremere
[3:44:19] <Fujiwara_92> Thin-blood are basically Blade, just a little lamer @angriestpat
[3:44:21] <SageEmpress> @SageEmpress is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[3:44:21] <cavefishes> ELMO
[3:44:21] <%mh9s> look at that baby

[3:44:28] <stabbityrabbit> @AngriestPat At least, that's how it was when this game was made. The most recent edition is set up so that the curse is actually worse the closer you are to Caine.
[3:44:29] <+runegod20> and the pier has some good shit there
[3:44:31] <+risenchudjr> man, this makes me want to play the tabletop game
[3:44:31] <%salty_syd913> ELMO!
[3:44:31] <+krawtch> sipsipElmo
[3:44:32] <+MrMcCrabby> omg pat just do the quest
[3:44:32] <%dukenux> E!mo
[3:44:33] <yourliteraldog> What if a thin blood becomes a werewolf dose it even out
[3:44:34] <lilmac64> @AngriestPat Well, Thin bloods don't have zero benifits. They're stronger than regular humans, but don't have any disciplines or magic. If the blood is weak enough in a Thin blood, they might not even have ALL the weaknesses. Some can stand the sun and others can eat regular food, granted these ones basically have no powers aside from supernatural anemia
[3:44:37] <natebud> try making everyone vomit blood or something, that'll work
[3:44:37] <%Laecerelius> apatElmo apatElmo apatElmo apatElmo
[3:44:38] <KatabolicRage> remmember to head up the pier for a sidequest you can PERMANENTLY miss
[3:44:41] <%ScreamingMeat> The only way to "decrease" your generation is to feed on powerful vampires
[3:44:44] <WorstCompany> Question: has Pat done the tutorial? Wondering if he was able to chill with Jack.
[3:44:47] <ninjaguiden> THERE HE IS
[3:44:47] <%waifoong98> Stop teaching him to litter Pat
[3:44:50] <DotDusk> BibleThump Hi Elmo
[3:45:00] <%connos_livereview> apatBlep <3
[3:45:00] <+risenchudjr> @WorstCompany Yeah he did. Jack best girl
[3:45:00] <+jimmybeegood> if there are Thin Bloods, are there THIN CRIPS?
[3:45:01] <%kitkat668> apatWink
[3:45:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat TO THE PEIR
[3:45:01] <+runegod20> he did the tutorial
[3:45:02] <saint_george> TO be fair V5 thinbloods gotten organized and are able to fight off older kindered
[3:45:09] <+sordcooper> @yourliteraldog you dont become a werewolf in WoD, you have to be born into a family of werwolves
[3:45:10] <Test_Subject_099> babey?!?!?!
[3:45:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> a baby grandpa
[3:45:14] <cavefishes> HE SPEAKS
[3:45:15] <ColonelMustach> Vamps can't become werewolves. Being a werewolf isn't a curse like that in VTM @yourliteraldog
[3:45:15] <pisshound87> i like nWoD better tbh, but i know a lot of people prefer oWoD
[3:45:17] <%lewdskeletor13> ELMO WE LOVE YOU
[3:45:18] <%luckysteak> I just got here, what kind of vamp is pat? a malk?
[3:45:21] <+logoth_> mew
[3:45:24] <%acediamonds> Yeah, just fight the Camarilla
[3:45:24] <%Afterman_> trem
[3:45:25] <+waterbuddy16> what a good boy
[3:45:25] <+Forticon> @luckysteak Tremere
[3:45:27] <%laserbeaming> Well, siring thin-bloods is probably undesired. So it kinda explains why you have to ask permission to sire
[3:45:31] <%acediamonds> I wonder how that'll turn out for them
[3:45:34] <%luckysteak> @Forticon thank you
[3:45:34] <PerrinIsDead> God damn i love elmo
[3:45:36] <yourliteraldog> @jimmybeegood spookythugs
[3:45:37] <%barkon345> dose Smiling Jack ever do his trick in this game?
[3:45:38] <+krawtch> so you got the thin mints on the beach and the were-men
[3:45:39] <%waterbuddy16> waterbuddy16 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:45:44] <+risenchudjr> 1
[3:45:45] <WorstCompany> @risenchudjr his character seems like one that’ll most likely reappear in 2 if they do bring back characters from 1.
[3:45:47] <ninjaguiden> typing on air LUL
[3:45:48] <Renkage098> Man...Remembering this game makes me sad that doing an Exalted version of this game would be borderline impossible. Because of the style mechanic
[3:45:50] <+runegod20> it's different, but can a thin blood lose all their humanity and permanently turn into a beast like normal vampires?
[3:45:52] <PerrinIsDead> LOOK AT THAT FLOPPY ELMO
[3:45:55] <pisshound87> haha
[3:45:55] <%waifoong98> LUL
[3:45:56] <+TheyTookMyBeard> majinoWeebey1

[3:46:04] <pisshound87> just dropping mad vamp lore on this old lady
[3:46:11] <%around_40_jobbers> Playing VtM without being a Nosferatu apatWhat
[3:46:19] <+jimmybeegood> Bloodlines 2 will be Thin Bloods vs Thin Crips, CONFIRMED
[3:46:19] <Demon_chann> LA sounds like a shit hole
[3:46:20] <%waifoong98> trying so hard to sound old hahaha
[3:46:21] <+risenchudjr> @WorstCompany Yeah - though, I think it is canon that he died in the v5 rulebook
[3:46:22] <%acediamonds> break the Masquerade on this old lady
[3:46:28] <haisho> so what did Pat pick? hopped on late
[3:46:29] <yourliteraldog> I see werewolves hereditary vamprism can be contracted
[3:46:29] <%PharosOfLight> @AngriestPat its funny, people did the math and aparently you are of a stronger generation than every other character you meet. Leads to some theories about your sire
[3:46:30] <lilmac64> @runegod20 Possibly. Some thinbloods are more Vampire-y than others. The really weak ones can't but the stronger ones still can.
[3:46:33] <%dukenux> If thinbloods are "broken" vampires, what cause nosferatu to be all fucked up
[3:46:33] <%CerberusDriver> V5 kinda sucks.
[3:46:36] <+abluecardigan> playing vtm without being a malkavian PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[3:46:36] <+runegod20> oh right, if you talk to her as a nosferatu, she straights up dies from a heart attack the moment you talk to her
[3:46:36] <+risenchudjr> @haisho Trememe
[3:46:36] <PerrinIsDead> Is she also in New Vegas as a ghoul??
[3:46:38] <+KanjiTatsumi> 🎸
[3:46:39] <+dtogo> So is Blade one of the most broken Vampires ever?
[3:46:40] <Demon_chann> @haisho tremere
[3:46:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Demon_chann bruh. it is
[3:46:48] <Marco_Apollo> DONT OPEN IT
[3:46:50] <ThatManSam> full glass of water, what a lush
[3:46:53] <+krawtch> Blade is so broken he has CGI eyeballs
[3:46:54] <Demon_chann> @Sphincter_Spelunker still is?
[3:46:59] <KeystoneA1> @runegod20 LAWD. OH SWEET JESUS. *Dies*
[3:47:00] <+risenchudjr> Bail bond? Better go to Killpatrick's Krimeputor
[3:47:00] <%CerberusDriver> There's stuff in V5 that fan fiction tier
[3:47:03] <ColonelMustach> nossys are ugly because that's the curse they got from cain @dukenux
[3:47:03] <pisshound87> this game really aught to give a better examine for like photos and stuff
[3:47:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer1000 Caine is generation 1. Antediluvians are generation 3. Vamps are 1 generation up from their sire, and generation number puts an upper cap on power. Thin bloods get a raw deal with their super high generation number. No wonder some resort to Diablerie.
[3:47:16] <DracaenaLeaf> that purr

[3:47:23] <$ooblagis> I haven't touched V5, but everything I've read has been kind of awful
[3:47:23] <+runegod20> you have a key ring
[3:47:31] <absolute_cagemony> NOT TODAY
[3:47:31] <Peculiar_Pangolin> Yes
[3:47:34] <valachi> No
[3:47:34] <%Laecerelius> Talk to your buddy the bailbondsman
[3:47:35] <Youwereeatenbyalid> he's a loud boi pat
[3:47:37] <lizard0tm> No
[3:47:38] <+risenchudjr> yeah, the v5 lore... kinda sucks. There are some nice mechanical changes - and some janky ones. I just kind of ignore the really stupid lore shit
[3:47:40] <byobuer> no
[3:47:40] <+nictron90> I think thin bloods are generation 13+ right?
[3:47:41] <valachi> My ears are fucked since I'm sick right now
[3:47:42] <%hntronium> I wonder if the Bloodlines 2 mc will diablerize a ton of vamps
[3:47:42] <%waifoong98> I am getting dejavu now
[3:47:42] <+MidnightBurst12> faintly
[3:47:43] <%SaltyDongs> no
[3:47:43] <%QueequegTheater> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype CoolCat CoolCat CoolCat CoolCat
[3:47:44] <DracaenaLeaf> I could yeah
[3:47:44] <%GarbageNirvana> Who owns the VtM license now?
[3:47:44] <+sordcooper> in the newest version of vampire, which is what Masquarde 2 uses, thin bloods can choose to stay thin blooded or eventually grow into full vampires
[3:47:45] <%MagickBurritoh> I can't
[3:47:51] <%acediamonds> @ooblagis I've read V5, it's fun looking. Still gotta play
[3:47:52] <%lewdskeletor13> He purs very loudly
[3:47:52] <CalderGaming> oooo, janky classics with classic jank
[3:47:52] <%CerberusDriver> @valachi the V5 lore sucks, people shoving their fan fiction and politics into it
[3:47:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Does Elmo's taile ever stop?
[3:47:56] <indig0bird> Yas!
[3:47:59] <lizard0tm> Yes
[3:48:00] <WorstCompany> @risenchudjr Hmm, now that makes me wonder if 2 will take place not at the latest point chronologically but instead between certain versions
[3:48:01] <PerrinIsDead> I literally never hear Elmo
[3:48:03] <+MrMcCrabby> i should read up on V5 then
[3:48:04] <indig0bird> He's a nice boi
[3:48:05] <yourliteraldog> Daibelrie sounds prettty metal
[3:48:06] <lizard0tm> Very quiet purring
[3:48:08] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> I like the tremere clan getting fucked up in v5, I don't know much else about it
[3:48:09] <+risenchudjr> @hntronium I dunno. My guess is that one of the clans offer up a blood hunted vamp to eat if you serve them
[3:48:11] <pisshound87> keyring is such a nice feature
[3:48:14] <SeaReally> computer
[3:48:15] <+HotBloodedHero> Not using headphones. Can't unless he's close to the mic
[3:48:16] <+ShadowArcangel> Use the computer
[3:48:16] <TwinBat> lmao
[3:48:17] <%acediamonds> Lore's always weird. Apparently Vienna exploded? fuck the tremere
[3:48:18] <%Laecerelius> computer?
[3:48:20] <tinypouf> check his computer
[3:48:20] <valachi> @CerberusDriver Yeah that's why I'm kind of concerned about how 2 will be. Sure there was political shit in this game but fuck me holy shit.
[3:48:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Demon_chann Most recent issue was moving the homeless somewhere else. People complain that it's close to their own homes, people defending the move don't even live in the area.
[3:48:24] <+jimmybeegood> use his comp u torr
[3:48:24] <lilmac64> @GarbageNirvana Paradox straight up ones the right, I think.
[3:48:25] <%JustToWatch> does this lore have the equivalent of pillar men?
[3:48:28] <Badgerconda_> computron, pat.
[3:48:28] <CoolGuyEddy> @AngriestPat pat the computer
[3:48:28] <+nictron90> remember the computer full'a names pat
[3:48:29] <Marco_Apollo> COMPUTER
[3:48:29] <+SolidusRex> Check the computah
[3:48:30] <ColonelMustach> Fuck the Tremere
[3:48:32] <lilmac64> *ownes
[3:48:35] <WorstCompany> The answer’s probably yes, but we got mods on this game? If so, which ones?
[3:48:35] <pisshound87> @JustToWatch Extremely
[3:48:36] <cacophanes> check the computor for his clients
[3:48:37] <natebud> @JustToWatch maybe...
[3:48:39] <Youwereeatenbyalid> FINd THE COMPUTER ROOM
[3:48:41] <MakeshiftSurgeon> Stop all the downloadin'.
[3:48:46] <%acediamonds> The Pillar Men are just the Antediluvians, change my mind
[3:48:47] <Demon_chann> @Sphincter_Spelunker damn
[3:48:47] <Dehlome> monkaS
[3:48:48] <+nictron90> Just the unofficial patch worstcompany
[3:48:56] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Why the hate for the tremere?
[3:48:59] <CalderGaming> subtle name
[3:49:03] <ColonelMustach> @acediamonds I wont, because your
[3:49:04] <%nmaten> @WorstCompany just the fan patch other than that its vanilla
[3:49:04] <+SatsumaVA> Car, Red
[3:49:05] <%acediamonds> Because the Tremere suck
[3:49:06] <ckkc1> Jermania
[3:49:06] <%crimsonharvest> red car huh
[3:49:06] <Halospaz117> Car type maybe?
[3:49:07] <%JustToWatch> cool
[3:49:08] <+risenchudjr> @JustToWatch Maybe? There are the Antedeluvians - 3rd gen vamps who are supposedly going to eat all the other vampires and end the world
[3:49:08] <ColonelMustach> your'e right @acediamonds
[3:49:08] <%velemi> Jermania???
[3:49:08] <%Exyoh> Seeing as a lot of the people who wrote this one are on for two, I trust them not to fumble it too hard with what the remains of White Wolf left them
[3:49:09] <Marco_Apollo> red car
[3:49:11] <+ShadowArcangel> He has a red car, maybe it's around?
[3:49:13] <%Laecerelius> Red car, german
[3:49:14] <tinypouf> red car
[3:49:18] <count_bob> Red car.
[3:49:20] <+RushUnplugged> I forgot about the jank-ass DOS computers lol
[3:49:22] <@commanderclaw> Look for his thunderbird
[3:49:23] <stabbityrabbit> V5 made some changes to the lore I actually liked. What are the ones that people seem to hate?
[3:49:24] <pisshound87> there are 12(?) piller men and they started all the major clans
[3:49:25] <artoflec> im really impressed with the writing so far..
[3:49:31] <NewWaveMasquerade> Pat: Hey, Kilpatrick! Kilipatrick: Yeah! Pat: See ya! Kilpatrick: :(
[3:49:31] <natebud> Volkswagon Van in the parking garage probably
[3:49:32] <+logoth_> Hey german boy go back to germania
[3:49:33] <%crimsonharvest> you might park a car somewhere
[3:49:34] <KatabolicRage> one of your quests will get stuck and never be completed if you don't look at the thing on the end of the pier pat.
[3:49:39] <%Laecerelius> Ze Germans!
[3:49:40] <artoflec> like i can't believe it still hits as much as it does for me personally.
[3:49:41] <+risenchudjr> 13 antedeluvians I think
[3:49:43] <buffmurffy> is there a lot more ore to this universe beyond what's in this game?
[3:49:45] <%acediamonds> I would rather actually play V5 than argue about it
[3:49:47] <KatabolicRage> don't want ya to wind up with that cluttering up your in progress quests
[3:49:47] <Peculiar_Pangolin> 13 yeah
[3:49:53] <strangelee> So how you liking Bloodlines, @AngriestPat ?
[3:49:58] <$PaleBloodInk> @buffmurffy Yeah, a lot more.
[3:50:00] <+runegod20> i'm pretty sure almost every single thing in this game is 100% accurate to the tabletop
[3:50:00] <+MrMcCrabby> there is more to vtm yes
[3:50:01] <ミュウレ4242> in theory, caine is like the super pillarman that kars becomes.
[3:50:02] <%JayEarly> @buffmurffy oh my yes
[3:50:02] <%acediamonds> also @risenchudjr there's more, but only 13 antediluvians made clans
[3:50:05] <+jimmybeegood> supposedly if you're past the 13th gen you're super likely to be thin blooded
[3:50:07] <%Edgy_Macaroon> in a trunk
[3:50:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer1000 Diablerie is a big no-no. Drinking all of a fellow vamp's blood will annihilate their soul, if their will doesn't overpower yours which can result in getting bodyjacked or hybridizing your psyches. Diablerizing lower generations can reduce your generation and give disciplines from other bloodlines.
[3:50:10] <%dukenux> i wonder where on the vampire hierarchy would Pillar Men be LUL
[3:50:10] <+risenchudjr> @buffmurffy tons and tons and tons. Some good some bad. There's a whole lot of other clans that are barely mentioned here
[3:50:12] <CalderGaming> how far are we from haunted house
[3:50:14] <SeaReally> LOL
[3:50:20] <roflcopter1940> Lore dating back to Caine and Abel
[3:50:22] <%waifoong98> Vampire Dairy Kappa
[3:50:23] <natebud> yet another corvair
[3:50:25] <KatabolicRage> I bet a toreador did this
[3:50:29] <SeaReally> @CalderGaming no spoikers!
[3:50:33] <%ace_cfa44> HELLO ED BOYS
[3:50:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Life has many doors, Ed boy
[3:50:44] <%acediamonds> @GeneralSCPatton Tremere and Giovanni gonna find that out the hard way
[3:50:47] <%dukenux> His name is Rolf and he was born in Dusseldorf
[3:50:53] <CalderGaming> sry
[3:50:55] <cacophanes> Toten means death in German or some shit
[3:50:56] <+risenchudjr> @CalderGaming at this rate... probably a while. He hasn't gotten the astrolite yet
[3:50:58] <pisshound87> the antediluvians just want to eat all their kids iirc, its why they are part of the end times prophecy
[3:50:58] <+jimmybeegood> so going from an antediluvian, there can be around 10 generations straight down until shit goes crazy
[3:51:05] <%Exyoh> Sucked by the son of a shepherd

[3:51:25] <%dukenux> Live has many veins, Ed boi
[3:51:26] <%acediamonds> The Antediluvians want to slate their bloodlust and thirst
[3:51:27] <SeaReally> ITCHY TASTY
[3:51:28] <ミュウレ4242> well, one antedeluvian had to be felled by the combines firepower of the technocracy (space mages) and kuei-jin (chince ghost vamps) using their biggest moves en masse all at once.
[3:51:29] <$ESP_ROOT> E
[3:51:35] <%acediamonds> only the entire world will slake them
[3:51:39] <+risenchudjr> Yeah, and in the dark ages if someone was born a thin blood they just killed them. They were super rare.
[3:51:45] <%acediamonds> then Caine wakes up and goes "Ugh, I hate my grandkids"

[3:51:55] <emillionghost> BibleThump
[3:52:00] <Wigglebottom_> hello everyone
[3:52:00] <ColonelMustach> It's not the antidiluvians that want to eat their children, it's just believed that when/ if Cain wakes up, the only thing that will sate his hunger will be all of the vitae from all of the kindred
[3:52:01] <%crimsonharvest> please make a real save at some point

[3:52:36] <Tomikozi> Is being a Werewolf better or worse?
[3:52:37] <$GoogleyGareth> LUL Just joined and first thing I hear is "This Vampire thing sucks."
[3:52:37] <NewWaveMasquerade> WOLF
[3:52:37] <ThatManSam> yeah what's the point of bbeing immortal if you're not a toilet
[3:52:40] <Tomikozi> Asking for a friend...
[3:52:40] <Mr_Strut> Immortality has a price
[3:52:40] <lizard0tm> Was that a wolf I just saw?
[3:52:40] <Covil91> Nah fuck Lily. She just bit E because he was like "Vampires, are you crazy?"

[3:52:41] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Welcome to VtM, where everything sucks
[3:52:42] <pisshound87> this game does a good job of establishing how awful it is yeah
[3:52:42] <%connos_livereview> @katabolicrage LUL
[3:52:46] <+ccwettr123> @AngriestPat but you could be immortal and NOT be a toilet
[3:52:48] <%acediamonds> Caine deserved better, but he also could've just apologized for killing his bro
[3:52:48] <natebud> Pat missed the big obvious werewolf
[3:52:49] <+runegod20> yes that was a wolf
[3:52:49] <%goose_attack_almanac> THAT WAS WOOFO
[3:52:52] <+risenchudjr> a WHITE wolf heheheh
[3:52:52] <$BuoyantSoul> Welcome to being a vampire. You’re either sad or sinister
[3:52:52] <+ShadowArcangel> VtM is the only vampire media for me that feels like vampirism is an actual curse and not just cool superpowers
[3:52:55] <Covil91> Lily is a trash [erspm
[3:52:55] <%Exyoh> Lone wolf. Must be nice
[3:52:57] <%acediamonds> Lilith probably could've gone better too
[3:52:58] <CalderGaming> wonder if there will ever be an Exalted game lol
[3:52:59] <%TheBigO75> Did we seriouslly miss the WW LUL
[3:53:03] <%Reizie_Etherealm> If I remember the photo of lily with the ginger hair right, wasn't she the person in the clinic that Pat saved?
[3:53:05] <Youwereeatenbyalid> MATT JUST LOST IT
[3:53:06] <NeoOneShin> antediluvians WILL eat vampires because only their blood can sustain vampires as old as they are

[3:53:12] <lilmac64> It's probably worth mentioning, the average Vampire is 12th or 13th generation. Thin blood shit doesn't start happening until about 15th or 16th. It's implied by your stat caps in game that you may be a 9 or 10th gen yourself.

[3:54:26] <+risenchudjr> Pat is never gonna do the main quest
[3:54:28] <Ranger747> Get in there Alanis Moriset
[3:54:29] <a1u5> GOd I hope he hits the mansion tonight, but if not, next Friday will be HYPE
[3:54:29] <ithirstforfreddurst> @CoolGuyEddy cool, thanks!
[3:54:30] <pisshound87> might be able to sell that and some blood to that guy you duped
[3:54:30] <%crimsonharvest> yeah the Astrolite is up there if you want to do the main quest
[3:54:32] <%Laecerelius> Yeah Pat's a huge vampire nerd
[3:54:42] <KatabolicRage> vtmb is one of those games where you hoover up all the sidequests before doing the main shit
[3:54:43] <%CerberusDriver> Never play as Malky on your first playthrough
[3:54:44] <Demon_chann> sell it to that thin blood scum
[3:54:45] <KatabolicRage> XP is important to get
[3:54:47] <ThatManSam> he's actually a tiny vampire nerd
[3:54:50] <Tampaoster> you mean hotel @a1u5
[3:54:52] <+FilthyHereticHorus> @AngriestPat You didn't go Malkavian??
[3:54:57] <%deviljhojho94> he is a good boy BibleThump
[3:54:59] <%Freelance7> Malkavian is best for second playthrough
[3:55:00] <Clyderso> Vampirism is one way pat can REJECT his HUMANITY
[3:55:01] <$ooblagis> Did Pat already find the girl in the clinic?
[3:55:03] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat you got any mods on this this game
[3:55:09] <%shotgang86> <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
[3:55:09] <pisshound87> Malk is more fun for second runthroughs imo
[3:55:11] <+runegod20> the non scam interaction with him is actually super endeering
[3:55:11] <valachi> @FilthyHereticHorus Malk is a fucking dumb idea for your first playthrough
[3:55:12] <+risenchudjr> the game wanted you too, though
[3:55:12] <StromkoPenguin> @ooblagis Yep he did that thing
[3:55:13] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @ooblagis yup, gave her blood
[3:55:15] <%bobofabyss> I played as a Malkavian on my first playthrough and had a blast, was pretty weird though to be fair
[3:55:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> @lilmac64 It's actually implied that your generation gets reduced somehow over the course of the game, since the Prince's Domination stops working at some point. Who could possibly be powerful enough to reduce your generation though?
[3:55:16] <Fujiwara_92> yup
[3:55:17] <%Swiglou> LUL
[3:55:19] <%TheBigO75> Did he ghoul the nerd girl?

[3:55:26] <+risenchudjr> Heather if alive!
[3:55:26] <buffmurffy> nosferatu REPRESENT
[3:55:26] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Tell me more about Malkavian and its gimmick
[3:55:28] <Renkage098> But....The stop sign
[3:55:28] <%acediamonds> Speaking of rejecting humanity, why not just go MAGE
[3:55:29] <+JackMillerTime> weird sounds fun tho
[3:55:30] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> They gave him Malkavian in the personality test though, which was pretty funny
[3:55:32] <Calindoor> did pat already deal with the twins?
[3:55:34] <Tampaoster> suck his bçood
[3:55:34] <Youwereeatenbyalid> *menacing*
[3:55:35] <%JJCheeker> Who needs nipples when you've got side boob apatCanada
[3:55:35] <%Freelance7> Nurse Woolie
[3:55:39] <+runegod20> might want to check the apartment later
[3:55:42] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> is paige a vampire and thats why she looks the way she does and pat looks the way he does?
[3:55:44] <DracaenaLeaf> Wasn't Lily outside?
[3:55:44] <+Forticon> @Calindoor he's only met Jeanette so far
[3:55:46] <%crimsonharvest> she probably went home after it turns out she regenerated on the spot
[3:55:46] <KatabolicRage> think about what lily was up to in here man
[3:55:47] <+risenchudjr> @Calindoor Nah, he met Jeanette though
[3:55:48] <%dukenux> what about crab nipple?

[3:56:04] <%TheBigO75> Menencing
[3:56:07] <+FilthyHereticHorus> @valachi I've played this game many times, any clan is good for any playthrough
[3:56:07] <%waifoong98> so jank

[3:56:10] <@commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Crouch
[3:56:12] <ThatManSam> git gud
[3:56:13] <CptBritches> Quit being bad at games
[3:56:13] <Renkage098> Because this game is borked to hell and back.
[3:56:14] <a1u5> You can unlock the creepy guy's door
[3:56:14] <%Edgy_Macaroon> she's not in there
[3:56:18] <+krawtch> witness this vampire struggle to operate a door handle
[3:56:19] <Tomikozi> Lovely jank
[3:56:21] <+thesilverhelix> because you don't need to open those
[3:56:23] <+risenchudjr> that might help a bit so you don't run into the door
[3:56:23] <+FilthyHereticHorus> but crazy talk and Malky are a match made in hell
[3:56:27] <Tomikozi> <3
[3:56:27] <%Exyoh> Yeah, she's here, but not in the morgue
[3:56:28] <yourliteraldog> Aren't Mages still human, just randomly powered up for no reason
[3:56:29] <Tomikozi> <7
[3:56:29] <+SolidusRex> There's something really funny to me about Pat calling for Lilly while searching random doors at a morgue.
[3:56:31] <$ooblagis> Talk to Blood Man
[3:56:34] <%Laecerelius> try the locked one?
[3:56:37] <InugamiTheHound> stock sound effects
[3:56:37] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat will you be talking about this on the Podcast?
[3:56:40] <%dukenux> this is why vampirism is a curse
[3:56:43] <ThatManSam> If only this game had an easy door mode
[3:56:43] <pisshound87> Count Patula is dripping with raw power and sexual energy
[3:56:43] <+jorgamund> the Masquerade is a motor skills test Kappa
[3:56:43] <ninjaguiden> Is that the Goldeneye N64 door noise?
[3:56:45] <%Laecerelius> damn
[3:56:47] <lilmac64> Here's a thought. Can thinbloods even go into Torpor if they get fucked up? Or do they just bite the dust?
[3:56:48] <cacophanes> I wonder who else knows about vampires in this hospital....hmm
[3:56:51] <+risenchudjr> did you open the chest in there?

[3:57:32] <Covil91> So even Malk ghouls are crazy

[3:57:50] <+runegod20> 100% malk ghouls are malk like
[3:57:55] <+risenchudjr> Yeah Malks are fucking nuts
[3:57:56] <+runegod20> even if a lesser degree
[3:57:56] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @JayEarly So big benefits at the cost of insanity and frenzy stuff?

[3:58:30] <KeystoneA1> I do wonder if all ghouls absorb a piece of their master's "personality" in relation to their clan

[4:05:48] <zedravan> and he sinks into the floor
[4:05:48] <%ElenaManetta> can we appreciate that there's some semblance of lip sync and not just mouth flaps for a game of this era
[4:05:50] <yourliteraldog> end him
[4:05:52] <+dashonjb1994> i feel like this guy was written by a teenage in the early 2000's
[4:05:52] <%waifoong98> kill him LUL
[4:05:52] <%Tucker0603> please tell me someone clipped that reaction
[4:05:52] <+Scarlet_Crow> Yeah, blood sacrifices are considered a crutch and bitch move by mages.

[4:05:59] <strangelee> You know, I feel like Arkane could have a fun swing at this series.
[4:06:00] <ithirstforfreddurst> @FLAMINGBABYPUNCH kinda, but Chris Avellone is writing for the sequel to this game!
[4:06:00] <%Rngiddion> that phrase could apply to every character in this game really
[4:06:01] <%Exyoh> That's the source engine for you
[4:06:02] <ape_hawk> Kinda wanna see Pat play through Vampyr, now
[4:06:06] <faegbeard> 21ft rule = guy with knife can rush a dude with a gun within 21ft and stab him before the shoot bang

[4:06:12] <+Ryallen> Don't help this psychopath
[4:06:19] <+jimmybeegood> I mean if you're smart with your blood you won't need him too much

[4:08:14] <%PharosOfLight> @AngriestPat if your brawl is low enough as you enter the next area, theres a guy who will give you a free point
[4:08:15] <Panquake25> Of course Pat named himself Count Patular
[4:08:15] <+GimmMeUhSammich> WAWAWAWAWAWA
[4:08:16] <todcomod> if you don't do a combat skill you won't be able to finish the game

[4:08:21] <SharkitYu> @AngriestPat stamina strength and dodge are useless if you are not melee
[4:08:22] <pisshound87> @AngriestPat spreading your points out is not a bad idea in this game, lots of low thresholds for skillchecks
[4:08:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> waowaowaowaowaowao

[4:08:26] <agadejobi> Is this another one of those Nomad Soul games?
[4:08:27] <natebud> I think you need some basic upgrades.

[4:08:29] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 8m.
[4:08:31] <%Captainahab_37> that song is so bad
[4:08:32] <%lewdskeletor13> WAOWAOWAOWAOWAOW
[4:08:32] <EnemyViolent> Do a combat skill for sure
[4:08:33] <ミュウレ4242> yeah, you can basically buy blood instead of ammo thanks to thaumatergy.
[4:08:36] <+MrMcCrabby> its actually good to sit on points if you dont know what to use it on
[4:08:36] <$ooblagis> @AngriestPat In case you don't remember, blood buff can push you over the top on a lot of skills checks, like lock picking
[4:08:37] <WorstCompany> We the....I forgot the name of the clan but the one with blood magic abilities?
[4:08:37] <+nictron90> Definitely not dodge as there's a book which can raise it a point for free, but not beyond 2
[4:08:40] <%LtSergei> the guy who did this music is back for Bloodlines 2, also
[4:08:41] <talisign> Why didn't he name himself Patucard?
[4:08:43] <KeystoneA1> Did you hit "Accept" on the character screen?
[4:08:49] <+GimmMeUhSammich> @Captainahab_37 no u
[4:08:49] <lilmac64> As fun as it is, Rank 4 and 5 Thaumaturgy completely snap the game's balance in half. Any non boss encounter becomes trivial afterwards.
[4:08:50] <+Forticon> @agadejobi no, think of this more like Deus Ex with vampires in modern day
[4:08:52] <%lewdskeletor13> @worstcompany Yeah the nerds

[4:15:23] <EnemyViolent> MELEE COMBAT REQUIREMENT
[4:15:23] <+SolidusRex> Use the bat, not the arm
[4:15:23] <%crimsonharvest> the arm is cool but you need more strength than that or something lol
[4:15:24] <$ooblagis> You're a caster*, cast
[4:15:24] <%Afterman_> youre using a severed arm and youre a caster
[4:15:25] <%Afterman_> so
[4:15:25] <+sordcooper> maybe get less shit at melee the next time you level
[4:15:25] <ValidVenasaur> unarmed is better
[4:15:26] <natebud> Well now we know what you need points in.
[4:15:26] <+risenchudjr> Bat ai'nt good for you either really
[4:15:26] <OverstrikeX> Use the knife
[4:15:29] <A_Red_Robot> Pat, you might not want to use melee weapons because you haven't invested much into them. Just use your blood strike stuff
[4:15:30] <+jimmybeegood> you're a mage Pat, just use your spells
[4:15:30] <Clyderso> humanity kicking ur butt
[4:15:30] <+SolidusRex> Or the knife
[4:15:31] <+Goat___Boy> What clan is Pat playing as?

[4:19:01] <natebud> F8, for easy access
[4:19:01] <+nictron90> It also turns off if it takes enough damage

[4:19:20] <%Order_of_Mystery> splornch
[4:19:21] <+runegod20> it's a drug lab man
[4:19:22] <natebud> And that's why you don't punch chemicals
[4:19:23] <pisshound87> you can shoot his meth lab and blow him up from outside
[4:19:26] <%ElenaManetta> "Every video game should have remappable keys"
[4:19:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> That was a fiery explosion. How is he not fucked?
[4:19:36] <+thenoodle007> Punch the drugs! Defeat the drugs!
[4:19:38] <EnemyViolent> Melee weapons have stat requirements
[4:19:38] <roflcopter1940> Punch a drug lab it explodes
[4:19:38] <+risenchudjr> so the bat is really bad for you - your melee SUCKS
[4:19:41] <StromkoPenguin> There was probably a bunch of old Star Wars toys melted into that acetone, very explosive combination.
[4:19:41] <WorstCompany> “Alright, who the fuck put muriatic acid in?
[4:19:46] <+Leyote> fuck played the whole game without finding hotkey menu
[4:19:46] <KatabolicRage> if you don't hit accept the new hotkeys are not changed
[4:19:48] <indig0bird> I'm leaving for more booze
[4:19:48] <roflcopter1940> thats some Aqua teen hunger force shit
[4:19:50] <indig0bird> Laters
[4:19:57] <EnemyViolent> If you don't meet the stat requirement for the melee weapon you're using it'll suck
[4:20:04] <Panquake25> @roflcopter1940 agreed
[4:20:04] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Wow, I didn't even know there was a hotkey menu
[4:20:06] <%Reizie_Etherealm> "It's probably caustic soda! Try that!"
[4:20:09] <indig0bird> Loving this game<3
[4:20:17] <%Meme_Platinum> damn

[4:20:42] <%RubberFistFight> that's not a knoife, this is a knoife
[4:20:42] <KatabolicRage> tremere are probably gonna wind up using guns
[4:20:43] <talisign> ause you a weak nerd vamp
[4:20:44] <Marco_Apollo> Shot the cops
[4:20:44] <KatabolicRage> and MAGIC
[4:20:50] <%GoldeNOVA> The virgin Tremere
[4:20:52] <@Pandora_Prime> Luckily your blood lasers are stronger than any weapon you'll need.
[4:20:53] <Marco_Apollo> shoot the cops
[4:20:53] <nepwar> whar kind of vampire punchs like a bitch?
[4:20:57] <gloriusUMU> only trust your fists, cops will never help you
[4:20:57] <EnemyViolent> I helped Pat :3
[4:20:59] <Covil91> Celerity with melee weapons is so cool
[4:21:01] <ミュウレ4242> fists are governed by brawl, not melee.
[4:21:04] <+SolidusRex> The damage potential is your best indicator on how much damage you'll do
[4:21:06] <nekodelic> missed the stereo?
[4:21:09] <pisshound87> magic should tide him over until downtown, where he can finally buy some decent guns
[4:21:15] <yourliteraldog> use your bitch boi blood magic
[4:21:16] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> beat up those beach nerds
[4:21:16] <joylent_blue> big crush
[4:21:16] <+SolidusRex> ALWAYS pay attention to damage potential.
[4:21:17] <+risenchudjr> yeah, Celerity is all time bullet time
[4:21:20] <KatabolicRage> lethality on weapons is also an indicator of how good they are against vampires
[4:21:20] <%TheBigO75> Poundin it
[4:21:21] <talisign> @GoldeNOVA The Chad Gangrel
[4:21:24] <KatabolicRage> cos vampires laugh at blunt damage
[4:21:24] <%brakkathoom> he missed moon moon
[4:21:29] <%TheBigO75> You're poundin it tonight man
[4:21:32] <$ooblagis> Tremere don't get Celerity, unfortunatley
[4:21:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> Isn't it hyper efficient to pick up and sell the extra weapons one at a time, like in Deus Ex?
[4:21:33] <Badgerconda_> higher lethality is also better against supernaturals, Pat.
[4:21:38] <yourliteraldog> MAGE 4 LYFE
[4:21:39] <cacophanes> and lethality is damage against VAMPIRES
[4:21:45] <goddamndavid> you're actually using km+m??
[4:21:48] <%LtSergei> you can't go back for it now
[4:21:49] <+risenchudjr> ah it was a while ago when the woof showed up

[4:22:08] <%Afterman_> well of course VAMPIRE fists are better than knife
[4:22:08] <Badgerconda_> There's no controller support for this, you babby.
[4:22:09] <Phoenon> Didnt this release alongside HL2
[4:22:10] <%waifoong98> ???
[4:22:11] <point_less_name> @AngriestPat what's your opinion on the game
[4:22:11] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @goddamndavid you have to type in passwords
[4:22:12] <SurpriseSoup> @goddamndavid I played VTM:B with KB:M
[4:22:15] <%nmaten> filthy casuals
[4:22:18] <Ion_Laser> @Phoenon yeah
[4:22:19] <%connos_livereview> IT DOES NOT HAVE FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORt
[4:22:21] <+runegod20> you also have to type to use the ingame computers
[4:22:27] <+risenchudjr> @Phoenon yeah, which is why is sold like trash
[4:22:27] <Peculiar_Pangolin> Came out the same day as HL2
[4:22:27] <%LtSergei> it came out on the same day
[4:22:29] <%TheBigO75> Wait, holy crap
[4:22:29] <a1u5> NO, literally the same day
[4:22:29] <nepwar> ah 2004 pc games
[4:22:30] <KeystoneA1> It came out on the same day as HL2
[4:22:30] <yourliteraldog> Counter Intutive that shit that kills magic crap, is less effective on normies
[4:22:32] <%nmaten> that doesnt seem right
[4:22:36] <Tampaoster> "fixed"
[4:22:36] <natebud> might be worth getting some skills in melee as a backup. What happens when you run out of blood?
[4:22:37] <%Niney_Who> Nope, that's wrong
[4:22:38] <Sabercry> what about HL: Source?
[4:22:39] <pisshound87> plus despite being a doofus mercurio is an alright dude and getting him to like you is good
[4:22:39] <%LtSergei> because valve said no games on source before hl2
[4:22:40] <a1u5> Both games came out on the same day
[4:22:40] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I don't think you can use controller with this anyways
[4:22:40] <Wan6Saber> @AngriestPat Nope, around the same time
[4:22:43] <joylent_blue> hes fiiiine
[4:22:44] <+Goat___Boy> no way! this is the first one?
[4:22:46] <+thesilverhelix> it came out the exact same day
[4:22:46] <AnApatheticAndroid> How long has Pat been streaming?
[4:22:46] <Badgerconda_> Same day. It -would- have been released first, but valve wouldn't let them.
[4:22:47] <%Verd_254> first source engine game that wasn't done by valve
[4:22:49] <+thenoodle007> EWWWW

[4:22:55] <%LtSergei> morphine doesn't heal you pat
[4:22:58] <roflcopter1940> It was the first non valve source game
[4:23:01] <T4silly> I'd love to see a remastered version released. That's be great.
[4:23:02] <%nmaten> I'm pretty sure cs source was the first source engine game but you can dream pat
[4:23:02] <joylent_blue> pat had NO choice, chat
[4:23:03] <CoolGuyEddy> "they left me no choice"

[4:23:36] <EnemyViolent> Yeah they didn't have access to the most recent builds of the Source engine so it's like a prototype version

[4:25:35] <Dr_Mooose> that sucks
[4:25:37] <Badgerconda_> Nah, they can. They just use a standard vampire power that lets them emulate being alive for a while.
[4:25:37] <ninjaguiden> OL kuudere vampire for life
[4:25:37] <%AncelDeLambert> Vampires have nothing to get up as it were, their insides are liquified
[4:25:38] <EnemyViolent> Jeanette just uses a lot of lube
[4:25:39] <+sordcooper> fun fact, Vampires CAN fuck, but you need to burn through some blood to turn your sexual organs back on
[4:25:40] <LeBlanc233> vamps have no sex drive feelsbadman
[4:25:40] <natebud> So that's why they need the blood
[4:25:40] <%Profbathrobe> He's a vampire info broker but he doesn't know whether or not they can bump uglies?

[4:25:42] <$ooblagis> Naw, just shove it in
[4:25:43] <KatabolicRage> it's not that vampires can't, it's that to them bloodsucking is vastly more pleasurable in comparison

[4:25:48] <ivansonic08> The only place where you want Rigor Mortus
[4:25:49] <yourliteraldog> Just use a penis pump
[4:25:49] <%goose_attack_almanac> Apparently the only thing vampires feel boned up about is drinkin blood
[4:25:53] <%LtSergei> the man on the couch and the lone wolf
[4:25:53] <MementoExtasis> but you have sneaky cat-feet and you can lift cars FeelsBadMan
[4:25:57] <+risenchudjr> So lady vamp can excrete blood into their vaginas as lube
[4:26:03] <+sordcooper> yeah all of a vampire's boidily fluids are blood
[4:26:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> @pisshound87 So eating 1 rat = 1 fuck?
[4:26:10] <nepwar> so vamps use magic vaigra to get it up? what about lady vamp do they have any issues?
[4:26:10] <Phoenon> quality chat discussion
[4:26:10] <pisshound87> yes
[4:26:11] <cumurasame> can vampires reproduce if they drink blood for 9 months? Do some tokyo ghoul shit like cannabalism while pregnant
[4:26:16] <Marco_Apollo> Wait so even thin-bloods can't have sex man that sucks
[4:26:18] <NewWaveMasquerade> Pfftt! Yeah, I'm sure his friends "concurred: her territory. More like they other way around.
[4:26:21] <SurpriseSoup> @talisign I prefer crazy Voerman rather than professional Voerman. But they're both pretty good if you get my drift.
[4:26:21] <%goose_attack_almanac> @GeneralSCPatton No! Eating one person is 1 cummie
[4:26:24] <+runegod20> if i fuck 1 rat can i eat 1human?
[4:26:30] <%ScreamingMeat> @Demon_chann All bodily fluid is replaced with blood when turned into a vampire. ALL of it.
[4:26:31] <nekodelic> @screamingmeat I don't know about that, but it doesn't really matter if the people who need it can't pay for it
[4:26:32] <pisshound87> they can also spend a point to digest something, so they can still get drunk
[4:26:32] <+runegod20> these conversation rates better go both wa ys

[4:27:19] <+runegod20> so this version of the patch doesn't have his drug side quest either?
[4:27:24] <%connos_livereview> probably more likely to have your blood drained then your nuts from vamp grils
[4:27:24] <MementoExtasis> duuuuude CiGrip
[4:27:27] <%Profbathrobe> Just get a squirt gun and fill it with garlic juice
[4:27:28] <talisign> @yourliteraldog It is indeed confirm at one point that Jenette fucks.

[4:27:56] <lilmac64> @cumurasame Not in VtM, but in it's New World Of Darkness equivalent, Vampire the Requiem, Vampires can give birth to Vampires by drinking a fuckton of blood and performing a hellish ritual. The result is basically a super weak vampire with greatly mitigated weaknesses.
[4:27:59] <%LtSergei> no pat
[4:27:59] <+risenchudjr> ... Pat...

[4:29:02] <%ScreamingMeat> @nekodelic Most people in the US can afford healthcare. But the reason it is so expensive is because of government programs and mandates like. Like Medicare. It was cheaper BEFORE the government stcuk its dick in the industry
[4:29:03] <EnemyViolent> sell

[4:29:21] <+nictron90> btw @angriestpat I dunno if the unofficial patch fixed this, but there used to be an exploit where if you sell someone a book, you can then buy unlimited copies to get some extra skill points out of them
[4:29:22] <CptBritches> Imagine wasting 40 dollars because you can't read
[4:29:22] <Mr_Strut> Pat's irl scholarship too low
[4:29:24] <natebud> $15 SeemsGood
[4:29:27] <a1u5> Good
[4:29:28] <talisign> No

[4:29:30] <cacophanes> good choice
[4:29:31] <The_Sighter> @frostmass22 dont need to strawman something thats as dumb as american gun laws, but go ahead and continue believing bullshit

[4:29:39] <+risenchudjr> Dominate is pretty good too
[4:29:40] <CptBritches> Yes
[4:29:40] <+Forticon> scholarship will also boost charisma along with research
[4:29:40] <%FrostMass22> Automatic rifles are fucking BANNED
[4:29:41] <TrueWarriorJak> Sure
[4:29:42] <Phoenon> More dialogue flexibility is always a plus in these types of games
[4:29:42] <SpaceGuntank> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[4:29:45] <%TheQButton> Talk make the big number!
[4:29:45] <Marco_Apollo> Dick points
[4:29:45] <$ooblagis> Dominate is better than persuasion
[4:29:45] <%TheMorilo> Is this game really that good?
[4:29:46] <+sordcooper> thats fine
[4:29:46] <dfederm> BLUD

[4:29:50] <%Meme_Platinum> BLUT
[4:29:52] <$BuoyantSoul> Big persuade. Big Dominate
[4:29:52] <+Dogfootjoe> pat you are a big smelly mustard pile
[4:29:54] <%Verd_254> apatLiz very charismatic
[4:29:55] <+Goat___Boy> You are my Angellll
[4:29:56] <+runegod20> why do people care about finance, i don't remember it being useful for anything
[4:29:56] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> pretty pat pretty pat
[4:29:58] <count_bob> Not for this clan.
[4:30:00] <+NoGodsNoSenpais> dialogue skill always best in games
[4:30:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> Big persuasion
[4:30:01] <pimpinahz> lol we should keep this chat stream politic free
[4:30:02] <ValidVenasaur> dominate gives speciql dialogue iirc
[4:30:02] <+sordcooper> dominate starts off OP
[4:30:02] <+jimmybeegood> WAOWAOWAOWAOWAO
[4:30:08] <natebud> @TheMorilo the writing seems to be exceptional.
[4:30:08] <rakishsage> Getting more Persuasion is usually better Pat.
[4:30:08] <SmilingDin> seduction
[4:30:08] <@commanderclaw> 2 and up
[4:30:09] <+Sepherdoodle> 2 and upwards
[4:30:10] <$ooblagis> 2 and up
[4:30:10] <%Niney_Who> 2 and up
[4:30:10] <$ESP_ROOT> SourPls WOW SourPls WOW SourPls WOW
[4:30:10] <riotshark> waowaowaowao
[4:30:11] <+Dogfootjoe> wehn youre not ugly
[4:30:11] <rakishsage> Since it's free.
[4:30:13] <pisshound87> i mean, trance is already good
[4:30:13] <+risenchudjr> So, I think both are good - there are DEF points where you can persuade but NOT dominate
[4:30:13] <+sordcooper> you already can
[4:30:14] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> Tremere don't
[4:30:15] <count_bob> Not in this clan not in speech.
[4:30:15] <Covil91> Every level unlocks new shit
[4:30:16] <NeroInfinite> 2 and up
[4:30:17] <NewWaveMasquerade> You mean in conversations?
[4:30:18] <+nictron90> Even at level 1 dominate is good for stealth because you can basically just stun someone and fuck off
[4:30:18] <pumpkingolem> I would say scholar for two skills getting improved
[4:30:18] <Sabercry> wao wao wao wao
[4:30:19] <%connos_livereview> WAOWAOWAOWAOWAOWAO
[4:30:20] <%Freelance7> waow
[4:30:20] <lilmac64> @cumurasame Just ritual, plus LOTS of blood. Also, the offspring is called a Dhampire. Weaker, but with fewer drawbacks. I think they can actually survive the sun.
[4:30:22] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> this bops
[4:30:23] <SchroedingersFerret> waow
[4:30:23] <KeystoneA1> Dominate in conversations is only for Ventrue and Malkavian
[4:30:23] <+risenchudjr> Like in the Giovanni mansion
[4:30:24] <%ScreamingMeat> WAOWAOWAOWAOWAO
[4:30:24] <%LtSergei> auspex also gives you skill buffs
[4:30:25] <+Thunder_Poo> I love Pat!
[4:30:25] <+GimmMeUhSammich> WAOWAOWAOWAO
[4:30:25] <$ESP_ROOT> fuck you pat
[4:30:30] <%PharosOfLight> @AngriestPat Tremer can't in this version
[4:30:30] <a1u5> Get persuasion, and next time, get dominate
[4:30:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I'm raising my eyebrows to the beat SourPls
[4:30:33] <Sabercry> why not have both?
[4:30:33] <linkinbird> Turn the music up IT SLAPS
[4:30:33] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> only Ventrue in dialogue
[4:30:34] <talisign> @TheMorilo Its alright. Near the end it becomes a series of enemy hallways, but before that its pretty open and versitile
[4:30:35] <rakishsage> You gotta invest heavily into Dominate to make it better than Persuasion.
[4:30:36] <+Sepherdoodle> I go for stealth personally
[4:30:37] <Phoenon> 5 seconds is a decent chunk of time
[4:30:37] <+Leyote> paragon vs renegade
[4:30:37] <+SolidusRex> Only Ventrue can use Dominate in conversations.
[4:30:38] <+Ell1ot> idk. i've never played
[4:30:38] <Fujiwara_92> Persuasion is better imo
[4:30:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> Persuasion is best
[4:30:39] <KeystoneA1> Malkavian isn't even dominate, actually.
[4:30:39] <+JackMillerTime> but if you cant persuade them
[4:30:40] <pisshound87> dominates fine, but its not used much in dialogue
[4:30:40] <+risenchudjr> Yeah, for treme put points in Persuade only
[4:30:41] <EnemyViolent> GUNS
[4:30:42] <rakishsage> But hey, it's cool to brainwash people.
[4:30:42] <NewWaveMasquerade> Dominate is more direct and will get you instant success.
[4:30:42] <Renkage098> I personally like Dominate. But up to you
[4:30:43] <riotshark> WAOWAOWAOWAOWAO
[4:30:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> !uptime
[4:30:44] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 30m.
[4:30:44] <%daisyyyy> Man this makes me wanna play this tabletop again
[4:30:45] <KeystoneA1> Malkavian is madness
[4:30:46] <+thesilverhelix> persuade is better
[4:30:48] <%brakkathoom> I think you can dominate Vandal to make him sell you blood
[4:30:49] <RevenTheLight> wuawuawua
[4:30:49] <saint_george> dominate doesnt work with non humans
[4:30:50] <+AlastorSlain> dom now pur later
[4:30:50] <$ESP_ROOT> SourPls WOW SourPls WOW SourPls WOW
[4:30:52] <cemsooo> Sell the RING pat
[4:30:52] <nepwar> invest all on luck
[4:30:52] <+runegod20> i'm pretty sure persuasion would have more applications
[4:30:53] <lilmac64> @AngriestPat The highest you need is Dominate 2 or 3 to unlock ALL of it's dialogue options.
[4:31:00] <Marco_Apollo> Has Pat said any subs this stream?
[4:31:02] <%FrustratedAF> maybe if i talk in max's chat enough i can sell a few copies of FEXL FeelsBadMan
[4:31:03] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> get pretty in game cuz you wont in real life
[4:31:05] <+thesilverhelix> you NEED dominate to do a quest later on tho
[4:31:06] <+SolidusRex> You have to be a Ventrue to use Dominate in dialog
[4:31:07] <cumurasame> @lilmac64 so... blood praying for immaculate conception...?
[4:31:08] <+thesilverhelix> but only level 2
[4:31:09] <nekodelic> @screamingmeat you would say otherwise, but I know it's hard to think too much with corporate dick in your mouth
[4:31:11] <+kuervojones> i'm assuming Pat didnt do the double start points trick?

[4:59:00] <+sordcooper> no, you're too smart to learn from them
[4:59:01] <OverstrikeX> NO
[4:59:01] <%torontototoro> Read book = gun go up?
[4:59:01] <%Afterman_> you already read them
[4:59:02] <+thesilverhelix> no
[4:59:02] <%LtSergei> read what it says
[4:59:02] <@commanderclaw> You already have a better stat
[4:59:04] <+SolidusRex> NO
[4:59:04] <lilmac64> @AngriestPat Your stats are already too HIGH to use them.
[4:59:04] <+CaptainJax> there are higher level books
[4:59:05] <SnaKemuho> they're unique one time
[4:59:06] <$lutefiiisk> NO
[4:59:06] <KatabolicRage> scholarship just lets you USE the books in the first place
[4:59:08] <+risenchudjr> You need better books - they won't push it past 2
[4:59:09] <Rhinoprotoss> READ THE TEXT
[4:59:10] <SharkitYu> @AngriestPat without schollarship you cant read them at all
[4:59:10] <%mh9s> they say they are "beneath you"
[4:59:11] <%PharosOfLight> stat books have a max level they can give you
[4:59:12] <%LtSergei> if it says its beneath yoru ability tis useles
[4:59:13] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @ninjaguiden Right mb
[4:59:14] <+ShadowArcangel> there will be better books that are harder to read to tiny baby brains
[4:59:15] <pumpkingolem> each skill book in the game as a set range that it can increase
[4:59:16] <Covil91> "Beneath your abilities" BENEATH
[4:59:17] <+runegod20> no, certain books require a certain level of research to use them
[4:59:18] <rakishsage> Research only allows you to use better skill books that work for higher levels.
[4:59:18] <pisshound87> 2 free computer and firearms aint bad though
[4:59:18] <pimpinahz> nooooo. items are beneath you. ur to good
[4:59:18] <Badgerconda_> scholarship only matters if the item description says "you can't use this because your scholarship isn't high enough" basically.
[4:59:19] <%Laecerelius> They're not unique, he read the gun book twice
[4:59:24] <+Grayhammatter> sell your fists
[4:59:25] <shattywack> Boy this looks PS2 era af
[4:59:28] <+risenchudjr> sell all that trash
[4:59:29] <+CaptainJax> sell arm
[4:59:31] <Badgerconda_> Read the item descriptions, and they'll tell you why you can't use them.
[4:59:32] <buffmurffy> sell your hands
[4:59:32] <Tampaoster> you have to upgrade you haggle dude
[4:59:34] <EnemyViolent> Sell the melee weapons you'll pick them up again
[4:59:35] <+runegod20> stuff like the bat and knife are so common that you'd fine them again anyway
[4:59:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> Your potions are too strong @AngriestPat
[4:59:37] <KatabolicRage> your not really a melee guy but having a severed arm is the best
[4:59:37] <%LtSergei> sure
[4:59:38] <WorstCompany> Your guy already knows the material. Find better books.
[4:59:38] <rakishsage> You'll find more of them.
[4:59:39] <OverstrikeX> SELL
[4:59:39] <%Leyote> you get an mba in english lit
[4:59:40] <nepwar> how does a severed arm have value?
[4:59:41] <+ToastyMozart> Yeah, if you up your scholarship level you might even learn what "beneath your abilities" means :P
[4:59:42] <Marco_Apollo> there was a spare tire iron in the red car
[4:59:42] <$ooblagis> Books will raise a stat up to a maximum. Scholarship is just a requirement for using them at all, it doesn't change that maximum
[4:59:44] <+Goat___Boy> Where did he get the severed arm?
[4:59:45] <pisshound87> yeah they are all kinda bad
[4:59:45] <TwinBat> lol
[4:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 5 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 20oz (600mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:59:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> Research enables usage. Book determines min and max level they benefit you.
[4:59:51] <+SolidusRex> Everything but the hand.
[4:59:52] <pumpkingolem> some books will need you to have a min of 2 in a skill but can be read twice to increase to 4

[5:26:49] <Sitromxe> The child soldier thing is a 4chan greentext.
[5:26:49] <Ion_Laser> so the usual David Lynch

[5:27:51] <KatabolicRage> it's just standard twitter outrage over nothing
[5:27:52] <nobody12349> Context needed
[5:27:54] <%Emperor_Machinus> Shield Hero is good though
[5:27:57] <%Mornaka> NEEDS CONTEXT
[5:27:57] <Sitromxe> Probably for the best that you dodged that.
[5:28:00] <%ElenaManetta> What's Shield Hero? Is that a Shovel Knight DLC?
[5:28:01] <%connos_livereview> ive also never heard of shield hero
[5:28:02] <sdgundum990> Except that's bs.
[5:28:03] <%Aydarkzero> what the hell is shield hero
[5:28:05] <Graxe_> Sounds like it needs a lot of context.

[5:28:21] <+Zereaux> dude gets accused of rape didnt actually rape anyone
[5:28:22] <+MonsieurHedge> it was nothing. a character in the show makes a false rape claim to antagonize the main character

[5:30:47] <%TheSniperJoe> cheer1000 The Shield Hero thing is utterly stupid, the original light novels are written by a woman and the entire controversy was manufactured by journalists looking to push a narrative about the showing being an MRA thing. It is not that, it's an Isekei show that mocks the ever living shit out of other Isekei shows (the other three protagnists are basically carbon copies of Kirito and other Isekei assholes), don't check it out because Kirby, check it out cus me.
