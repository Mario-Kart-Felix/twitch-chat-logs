[0:26:57] <%KaiserMario> Lacks personality, in my opinion
[0:26:58] <%코코꾸라> @toahmes They said they wanna improve battery life
[0:26:59] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Show it, pls
[0:27:00] <%Ranryu692> I hope it's fake, that looks like trash
[0:27:00] <YakumoYomi> I agree: the white and black should be inverted
[0:27:00] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:27:00] <Cpt_phantom> Is it the ps3 boomerang?
[0:27:00] <%kyh9> Hopefully real D Pad?

[0:27:02] <%GabeSweetMan> Wait what is lit?
[0:27:03] <%0oki> show it
[0:27:05] <%SirGO0SE> looks like a pro controller tbh
[0:27:06] <%dekkitout> Right?!
[0:27:08] <%collind99> VERY DIFFERENT
[0:27:10] <%Quigsies> Hope the console is black and white as well
[0:27:10] <soraabora> hopefully it comes in black lmao
[0:27:11] <+PR0swagonist> Please come in black
[0:27:11] <%kyh9> lol, it looks like a fake sci-fi controller from the future
[0:27:13] <%optimasmaximas> @Ranryu692 official playstation account tweeted it
[0:27:15] <%Valdorick> Marcus "Game God" Huemon
[0:27:19] <%GabeSweetMan> Oh ps5 controller?

[0:27:33] <%KaiserMario> Now your controller spies on you!
[0:27:34] <%RNGbob> gamer become human
[0:27:35] <%Typhaeon> I'd love a controller I could actually grip overhand like I used to
[0:27:35] <%shaidot> nevermind
[0:27:36] <mattynezz> Oh god, I can feel my hands cramping already
[0:27:38] <%ShichiNoBushi> "Heart rate and sweat sensors"?

[0:27:44] <InfinitySaiyan> fuck it one more
[0:27:44] <soraabora> now my ps5 can become human
[0:27:45] <$PadreHail> PS5 controller looks like the Spidey PS4 costume as a controller
[0:27:49] <+HouseofNonsense> But does it slap?
[0:27:49] <%McSoliace> i remember the ps4 controller being liked early on
[0:27:52] <%cvp5127> so white ps5 confirmed?
[0:27:53] <%Valdorick> 420 dab
[0:27:53] <cureneckbeard> word

[0:27:57] <%spiritofmojave> Stop talking
[0:27:58] <+NitronStreams> Its looks like the xbow controller and dualsock had a baby
[0:27:58] <idfk_panda> pls no
[0:27:59] <%Emperor_Machinus> But does it also slap?
[0:27:59] <+BeefMcCat> The share button is now just the "create" buton which is probably the same function
[0:28:00] <YakumoYomi> Is this gonna be $80, like the Switch Pro?

[0:39:36] <LeaIsChill> @Fooguwu The 1920s heyoooo
[0:39:38] <%hntronium> Guys he already used Yusuke in vanilla P5
[0:39:40] <%mankeyfigh> don't lie to me and yourself
[0:39:41] <vvaxyer> Do rougelikes make you go insane?
[0:39:42] <YakumoYomi> @RealThiele Very nice.
[0:39:43] <%shaidot> i never use morgana for the rest of the game as soon as i get yusuke
[0:39:43] <%trustycoyote> Ugh.... Yusuke. Did not care how good he was, he was last in my rotation
[0:39:46] <%optimasmaximas> "have you.....gained some weight?"
[0:39:46] <$Dakuu75> I feel bad for the thousands of ppl watching Valorant streams trying to get keys
[0:39:48] <%hntronium> That's why he isn't using him this time

[0:54:07] <%reonome> you don't have the library books
[0:54:09] <Scotaku> Akira is also the name the game auto-completes if you leave the confession blank.
[0:54:09] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @primax104 FF7 on thurs
[0:54:11] <%MonsterEnvy> Only one person said yes
[0:54:13] <%mighty_max_t> I couldn't remember how to spell kurusu or whatever so I named him Akira Maeda after the wrestler
[0:54:18] <Golden_Battler> @Dakuu75 Bro, Japanese has nothing to do with students being fuckwads
[0:54:20] <tactician0> you asked to q

[0:55:06] <CuttleCrow> Japan still uses fax machines, like widespread use fax machines
[0:55:07] <+knowyourenemy_97> i see Pat is taking his time!
[0:55:09] <%MonsterEnvy> You can level up Ryuji
[0:55:10] <AnthonyJMax> studying

[0:55:46] <%hmgirlpopuri> I can't figure out if I just missed it my first time through and am noticing it more, or if they actually have more confidants showing up in the background
[0:55:49] <mattdel92> Throw shit at them to increase confidence
[0:55:51] <+obviousdecoy> you can get a book out from the library too to read at home
[0:55:53] <omen_setter> Bobby increases his guts by exposing himself to twitch chat
[0:55:56] <%logoth_> no chariot persona?

[0:56:12] <%RetroCop87> confidants priority > stats priority
[0:56:12] <%mister___doctor> Pat you know what tommorow is, go hit up Takemi for some "medicine"

[0:58:39] <timetraveller2000> Ame-no-Uzume this early?

[0:59:18] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> koh-ha
[0:59:23] <+Chosington> yes, deaf.
[0:59:24] <BluBox> Deaf?
[0:59:26] <Huntercd> Oh she was wearing a purple thong
[0:59:27] <+abrupt_abe> Why not just press triangle at the register screen?
[0:59:29] <%hmgirlpopuri> @bakasan77 I think it's just background details/cameos
[0:59:29] <timetraveller2000> @kenori you sit inside and it’s dope
[0:59:31] <+BubbaRands> deaf? huh...
[0:59:31] <$PadreHail> You have to fuse Berith and Suzaku to get Frei on Ame no Uzume @patstaresat
[0:59:31] <OldManDeckardCain> ame no uzume is only good for getting yusuke an op sword early LUL
[0:59:36] <heartlesshealer> yeah old one's real good
[0:59:38] <%Kenori> that sounds DOPE AS HELL

[0:59:45] <%Kenori> PENIS TROLLEY!
[0:59:54] <%starotter70> Touch Ryuji's Dick
[0:59:58] <+CateSupremo> The velvet rooms are different for each person who enters it
[0:59:59] <$ThomasOfTroy> Pat, you can hit triangle to compare in the registration screen
[1:00:01] <+bakasan77> Ah okay. I’ve only done it a few times and idk what it does really
[1:00:03] <timetraveller2000> @bakasan77 saves your Persona stats so you don’t have to constantly level them
[1:00:05] <mattdel92> Make the penis trolley!
[1:00:08] <%Valdorick> Why does that plant have tiddies?
[1:00:09] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Registering saves them in their current state, good for fusion later
[1:00:16] <+bakasan77> So should you do it all the time ?
[1:00:24] <%galaxyswirl> no
[1:00:24] <$PadreHail> Velvet Room is basically Silent Hill for light novel protagonists

[1:30:23] <+keepitratchet> @TimetodiveLTX SUBATOMIC PENATRATION RAPPING FIRE THROUGH YOUR SKULL
[1:30:26] <+evbites> hi i'm an ex con give job
[1:30:30] <%AmericanaRed> EZ
[1:30:31] <%starotter70> Wow, it's that easy!?
[1:30:34] <timetraveller2000> @schlager087 cries in retail :(
[1:30:35] <%GabeSweetMan> I wish getting work was that easy.
[1:30:38] <%Flightedwings> If it was that easy
[1:30:38] <%AmericanaRed> no interview??
[1:30:39] <%mighty_max_t> See, Millenials? Its that easy Kappa
[1:30:40] <%mankeyfigh> That was too easy
[1:30:41] <%NovaKnightmare> Persona 5 is a fantasy RPG: You hang out with friends outside and can get a job
[1:30:44] <shieldecho> ...sigh..
[1:30:45] <Ralfclogs> P unrealistic
[1:30:46] <Aydarkzero> yes
[1:30:46] <+evbites> yes
[1:30:47] <%NovaKnightmare> yes
[1:30:49] <%aishman> Yes
[1:30:50] <mastertwin2> yes
[1:30:55] <%Frost_Quill> yep
[1:31:00] <%Frost_Quill> oh
[1:31:04] <@StridentSong> You have to find the treasure by the 29th
[1:31:06] <%coreyyotto> It's tight that you get to work whenever you want. Easily the most unrealistic part of this game involving demons.
[1:31:08] <%NopeBadguy> Don't think it was
[1:31:09] <mastertwin2> No it wasnt
[1:31:09] <Aydarkzero> i just did it LUL
[1:31:09] <+schlager087> @timetraveller2000 I'm actually IT who supports in remote support so I feel you, but can't complain, there are people who'd kill to have paychecks coming in now
[1:31:10] <%spiritofmojave> It wasn't
[1:31:11] <MomsForseti> lol it wasnt
[1:31:11] <zenorot> Its basically anime Sim City
[1:31:11] <%galaxyswirl> IT FUCKING WASNT
[1:31:15] <@StridentSong> Because you can't send the card without finding the treasure
[1:31:15] <%aishman> IT WASN'T
[1:31:16] <%Dragon_Batman> It wasn't
[1:31:16] <Asblom> you cant clear the palace on a sunday
[1:31:17] <%suikudo> Isnt it better to send the card right away?
[1:31:17] <+evbites> it was not then again i'm dumb
[1:31:17] <%Frost_Quill> it wasn't
[1:31:18] <+ElEversoris> everyone can I get an F in chat I lost four hours of progress today because I shut my PS4 off without saving
[1:31:24] <%RPGJacob> I'm surpised you don't do that stuff immidately after getting it
[1:31:24] <+keepitratchet> it wasn't, but why not send card earily
[1:31:24] <Naho_Saenoki> F
[1:31:25] <%brickwall35> @keepitratchet OH SHIT I'M FEELING IT
[1:31:26] <%solzan2000> I don't remember that calender
[1:31:28] <%VioletHeart> Hey Pat, just tuned in. How's the P5R going?
[1:31:29] <%galaxyswirl> I SPENT 200 HOURS FARMING SEVERAL TIMES CAUSE I KEPT FUCKING UP
[1:31:31] <%solzan2000> prolly me
[1:31:35] <%GabeSweetMan> I fucked up once later on yeah.
[1:31:35] <%starotter70> @ElEversoris Sucks man, F
[1:31:43] <%Dragon_Batman> You need the final days for the story to unfold tho
[1:31:44] <%galaxyswirl> IT LITERALLY MADE ME NOT WANT TO PLAY
[1:31:44] <+keepitratchet> @brickwall35 TAKYONNNNNN
[1:31:46] <+evbites> the failure is the rawest you get shot and bleed out
[1:31:47] <%mankeyfigh> I just got it out of the way right away
[1:31:48] <%optimasmaximas> @suikudo that's what i heard, i always waited till the last day, but apparently it's better to send it immediately
[1:31:48] <%bevyrage> time to RETAKE THE NIGHT
[1:31:49] <mastertwin2> What's the downside of just doing the whole Calling Card and boss early?
[1:31:49] <%shaidot> if you do that with the third palace the ending is really dark
[1:31:52] <Phoenon> Dang, I can't go outside either Kappa
[1:31:53] <%SH1NK1R0> It wasn’t. Also you can’t just beat it and it will force you to wait the full duration anyway
[1:31:54] <%reonome> I would study tbh
[1:31:55] <%BoomerUnchained> >not doing it as fast as possible and just goof off the rest of the time DansGame

[1:32:17] <%NopeBadguy> Is it not possible to send multiple calling cards?
[1:32:19] <%suikudo> @optimasmaximas i only ever did it right away
[1:32:20] <zenorot> I usually just sent the calling card and did the social stats immediately after
[1:32:25] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @PatStaresAt you might wanna finish palaces as soon as possible later on. I missed out on stuff by leaving them last, in Vanilla anyway

[2:17:09] <Charlie99993> I always sent Morgana for this
[2:17:12] <zenorot> I did with Morgana on my first playthrough
[2:17:19] <%Deano8817> I did it with anne
[2:17:24] <Phoenon> HP attacks are still so good
[2:17:34] <timetraveller2000> I always send Ryuji to do this, seems the most Appropriate
[2:17:34] <+keepitratchet> Pat could probably beat him without knocking off the crown lol
[2:17:35] <zmuno> @Deano8817 it is different?
[2:17:39] <%MonsterEnvy> Man Pat is overleveled
[2:17:45] <tactician0> honestly you could have gone for the kill by now
[2:17:45] <%Aeoneth> @zenorot So did I. I thought the choice mattered and figured it made sense that he'd overlook Morgana since the other 3 had drawn his ire
[2:17:55] <%asgard147> limesPoggers
[2:17:55] <%Deano8817> @zmuno the dialog's certainly different, but it always succeeds
[2:17:55] <Phoenon> How did he manage to miss Ryuji of all party members

[2:20:47] <%Shady_Squid> She's super not
[2:20:47] <cumurasame> @PatStaresAt You can up to Merciless to kill mobs instantly with the x3 damage and switch bakc to Normal/Hard when recruiting Shadows or fighting Bosses. Also, Merciless makes the Challenges battles easier to do if you have a strategy. You can probably do the Narukami fight pretty early even.

[2:21:00] <%SirGO0SE> this is the most unrealistic trope in anime. everyone would do big murder here
[2:21:06] <%GabeSweetMan> Though admittedly seeing someone get PUBLICLY trashed is more satisfying depending on your priorities.
[2:21:06] <+PleasantLee> not really sure they are "Phantom Thieves" .... more Phantom Muggers. they beat you until you give up your money

[2:21:39] <YakumoYomi> Way to kill all the tension from the previous scene.
[2:21:40] <%GabeSweetMan> I do appreciate that they are TOTALLY down with murdering him even though she ultimately decides not to do it.
[2:21:41] <CuttleCrow> CAT WHY
[2:21:45] <TimetodiveLTX> the optimal strategy for visible spoilers is not to point out they're spoilers
[2:21:46] <+michingmallecho> Oh cat

[2:22:05] <%kyh9> Ryuji, if you didn't have Right angles for legs, we wouldn't be so fucked
[2:22:05] <Manwad> i thought his entire leg snapped at the knee
[2:22:07] <%floralkami> @pettyfunk and losing her parents respect
[2:22:07] <timetraveller2000> Look at that not cat doing not cat things
[2:22:07] <zenorot> I thought Morgana was all about not harming the people they steal from
[2:22:09] <%reonome> ryuji the cripple

[2:22:37] <shevan123> you got all the shit
[2:22:37] <+SpicyCheeseNips> You...........did it.
[2:22:39] <mattynezz> The reason Mona turns back into a Cat is because the animation studio got their instructions pretty early in development, so lots of details, like when Mona should change back into a Cat, got changed. See also; Joker not having glasses most of the time
[2:22:40] <%Shady_Squid> Who's talking!?
[2:22:40] <$Dakuu75> so Kamishida broke ryuji's leg, yeah?

[2:23:17] <+Katohearts> Just the one gold medal though
[2:23:17] <%floralkami> @42nfl19 no cause they still feel fatigue in the real world afterwards
[2:23:18] <errasos> I thought the implication was that he kinda had a mental breakdown due to the expectations
[2:23:19] <%MonsterEnvy> Yeah the Treasure is what caused the distortion.
[2:23:20] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> NO 1 YEAR CRIMES

[2:56:29] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Kawakami doesnt rape until MC, but thats only statutory rape. Kamoshida is like hardcore RAPE
[2:56:29] <timetraveller2000> Consent is a big part of it, it’s gotta be said
[2:56:30] <+Grayhammatter> lemme get DAT BOOTY
[2:56:32] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @Frost_Quill A morally grey character is evil or does evil things, but is also hot. One is hot, one is not.
[2:56:32] <PrimordialDonut> Consent and lack of physical abuse?
[2:56:35] <Jetsfantasy> Yeah, but cops would make him look like the victim
[2:56:38] <warmnoid> there's no consent when your a student and the other person is in a position of power over you lmao
[2:56:39] <zenorot> But Kawakami is cute waifu tho
[2:56:39] <+BubbaRands> BOTH ARE BAD

[2:56:42] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Kawakami actually tells you that she ain't doing any sexual shit with you but dating is mehh
[2:56:42] <PettyFunk> Both are super unethical due to power dynamics
[2:56:43] <mak0t0yukii> LUL
[2:56:43] <%spiritofmojave> both are pretty bad
[2:56:43] <%Ultimatefool> The bad
[2:56:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MUTUAL CONSENT
[2:56:45] <%kyh9> Statutory rape is still rape, consent doesn't matter, lol
[2:56:45] <RavenHellkite> but you want to date sae tho

[2:56:50] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Kawakami gets consent, Kamoshida doesnt nuff said

[2:56:51] <+DinnerCalzone> there's no winning in this conversation
[2:56:52] <%indig0bird> Kamoshida is an abuser taking adavantage of his position, it would be almost exactly the same as if both were adults
[2:56:53] <mak0t0yukii> It's a big trap
[2:56:53] <+b9k9com> isnt politics guy on sunday night?
[2:56:53] <+Grayhammatter> it is a big trap
[2:56:53] <+ZipperHands> @PatStaresAt I feel like alot of this problem wouldn't happen if Joker and crew were aged up and were college students instead of high school minors
[2:56:55] <%asgard147> THEN STOP
[2:56:55] <shiny_prinny> Kawakami has authority over Joker right? wouldn't that mean consent can't be given?
[2:56:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> JOKER IS AN ADULT IN JAPAN
[2:56:56] <+SpicyCheeseNips> "Aggressor" is kinda taking it far
[2:56:56] <%BoomerUnchained> it's fine
[2:56:57] <+keepitratchet> One is fucking weird, the other is fucking weirder
[2:56:57] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt just call it the WWE album
[2:56:57] <jobbedbone> BIG RAPE
[2:56:58] <%NeoCre> @frost_quill I’d say it’s the fact that you are the one to initiate the relationship. She’s also quite hesitant about it and repeatedly considers breaking it off
[2:57:00] <%startstoprepeat> it's okay because she's tired
[2:57:01] <%j0ustar> one is 1% less bad than the other that's all
[2:57:02] <%NovaKnightmare> WHY HE SIT
[2:57:02] <%logoth_> Sculzy
[2:57:03] <timetraveller2000> Either way it’s a yikes situation NotLikeThis
[2:57:03] <+NitronStreams> "no. i sense ive made a mistake"
[2:57:05] <Copperama> oh yeah, minors can't consent, so... no bro
[2:57:05] <%SoFarFetched> Even if there is consent, the law says otherwise.

[2:57:17] <%za7az> Kawakami is kinda against it too, but she needs the money
[2:57:17] <DarknessD42> I wanna sit like Mona
[2:57:29] <%ape_hawk> @PatStaresAt is X-files as good as star trek?
[2:57:29] <%kyh9> @indig0bird incidentally, MC is basically blackmailing Kawakami to give him free classes and shit
[2:57:31] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @SoFarFetched Yea but theyre still two different kinds of rape with different contexts
[2:57:31] <%valriot> @patstaresat Considering Japans age of consent, it's actually not that weird in context
[2:57:32] <soraabora> in context theyre both bad lol

[2:57:44] <YakumoYomi> There's a debate regarding "consent", when you've got the "power imbalance" of the student-teacher relationship. Some would argue that there can't be consent, in that case, because of said imbalance of power
[2:57:47] <%BoomerUnchained> How do read?

[3:55:34] <Jetsfantasy> His name's Zoro, he's like a samurai
[3:55:36] <ScreamLord> That threw me off that Japanese schools are open on Saturdays
[3:55:37] <+SpicyCheeseNips> Zorro is cool. He likes to write the letter Z
[3:55:39] <BurdRightsActivist> Zorro's so cool, it's just a shame a persona named after him has to be tied TO SUCH A SHIT CHARACTER LUL

[4:45:33] <%StaceMcGate> TUMS FESTIVAL
[4:45:34] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @doc_ock_rokc WTF where do you live. WI its legally 7.50 but no job has dared to go below 12
[4:45:35] <%shaidot> thats nuts!
[4:45:41] <%shaidot> Might kick it up to merciless
[4:45:42] <YakumoYomi> @XeroSigmaPrime Unfortunately, $7.25 is minimum wage here in NC
[4:45:42] <deviljhojho_> FeelsBirthdayMan happy birthday
[4:45:47] <%floralkami> @typhaeon missed Hitler by 2 days, phew!
[4:45:51] <+Grayhammatter> whoa, y'alright pat?

[4:45:57] <@SSaryn> WORDS
[4:45:58] <deviljhojho_> words are hard
[4:46:00] <%spiritofmojave> you ok? LUL
[4:46:01] <%ShichiNoBushi> Yee... haw
[4:46:01] <+themaskedman4u> every day is a tums festival..
[4:46:01] <%Typhaeon> If only Hitler turned to marijuana instead of meth
[4:46:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @necrocannibal2 Mah uses my amazon account to watch her shows so my prime subscription goes to pat
[4:46:13] <%Typhaeon> sincerely, a guy who does not partake
[4:46:22] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> If only Hitler was good at art, he wouldn't have been a writer
[4:46:28] <%Alazull> Don't wait on books
[4:46:31] <%Alazull> Wait on DVDs
[4:46:32] <+Weeewer> To get speed reading dont you need to finish the first batch of books??
[4:46:33] <+necrocannibal2> @doc_ock_rokc oh, that makes sense
[4:46:37] <+SpicyCheeseNips> its a free knowledge
[4:46:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> @XeroSigmaPrime Texas, our cost of living is low to compensate for it
[4:46:37] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @YakumoYomi I mean legally, but do employers actually pay that? Its 7.50 in WI but its impossible to find a job here that would dare go under 12
[4:46:38] <+Grayhammatter> free knowledge
[4:46:41] <%Alazull> Until you get the boost from Shinjuku
[4:46:43] <@SSaryn> Wouldn't say it's best, books still pretty useful
[4:46:46] <+Grayhammatter> hell yeah
[4:46:52] <%floralkami> @typhaeon if only, sincerely a guy who quit recently
[4:47:01] <%Alazull> DVDs + boost is 6 stat points per DVD
[4:47:22] <YakumoYomi> @XeroSigmaPrime Definitely. I think the lowest I've personally been offered for a job is $8.50, though.
[4:47:25] <+BigDumBeak> WAIT WAIT WAIT where are they watching tng and ds9?!
[4:47:31] <BeefyQueefer> Paige smeels
[4:47:42] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @doc_ock_rokc Dayum that sucks. Well you can always go my route and suck your boss's dick to get 15. Worth it to get a decent wage thru HS and college
