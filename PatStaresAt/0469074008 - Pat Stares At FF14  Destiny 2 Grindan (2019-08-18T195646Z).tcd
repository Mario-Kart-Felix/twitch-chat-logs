[1:07:17] <+forebringer> Rip

[1:07:19] <mayorrev> pat you're so toxic!!!
[1:07:20] <%Typhaeon> Why are they even continuing
[1:07:20] <+OlavOlavsson> 80 minutes on the timer, don't give up coward
[1:07:21] <+PlagueOfGripes> 15 minutes of ass whipping
[1:07:22] <+Cuon_Alpinus> inspect the healers and blm
[1:07:22] <mayorrev> reeeeee
[1:07:24] <Valdorick> Maybe the turret will learn he can pick up and move.
[1:07:27] <%sshen> Pat, look at the BLM and WHMs gear
[1:07:27] <+EatinEden> all you can really do is bm
[1:07:31] <JonKhan> 2 attempts isn't terrible but it does seem sloggy
[1:07:33] <xeros720> yeah, i'm curious too
[1:07:34] <%Remery_> @Estuko it's all coming back to me, need to look for one on the PS4
[1:07:35] <%Kirijuo> Cure 1 and Medicia II mage
[1:07:35] <%arcaderabbit48> @Ser_Randal He is a little punishing since a lot of his mechanics punt you off the arena which kills you outright, but generally speaking he's not a hard boss
[1:07:36] <+PlagueOfGripes> sadly never caught on stream so we can't confirm
[1:07:36] <Jdrockefeller> heals suck
[1:07:38] <%MoonObscure> yup you dont do this shit on the weekends
[1:07:39] <BunnyEmperor> Games hard man
[1:07:46] <arkv01> pat was almost gonna say "the healers are shhhhh... not good"
[1:07:48] <%QuadraticGravity> Tell the BLM to go get their 80 gear
[1:07:51] <%ZizerX> so hes just bad
[1:07:52] <BunnyEmperor> Weathered set on WHM LUL
[1:07:56] <ittla> this fight aint that tough
[1:07:57] <%Typhaeon> WHM in 430 LuL
[1:07:59] <kindashagg> Healer solve problem? No, healer make problem.
[1:08:00] <damienlunas> oof
[1:08:01] <+FutaSnek> Gotta bring your A game
[1:08:06] <%apostateCourier> 430 is fine for normals
[1:08:08] <%Remery_> now flame them Patty :)
[1:08:09] <+textandnumbers> 430 is fine if you know what to do
[1:08:09] <%Estuko> @Remery_ I also rememer something about alien anthill/antfarm?
[1:08:09] <SweetCuppingCake> That gear is baaaaad
[1:08:12] <%sshen> That WHM being in that gear and still spamming medica is offensive to me
[1:08:12] <+Rose_Silver> TELL THE BLM TO GET HIS AF GEAR
[1:08:14] <%radda343> is the ilvl requirement too low?
[1:08:14] <SweetCuppingCake> Yikes
[1:08:16] <xeros720> seems like he should be using Divine Benison on himself
[1:08:16] <damienlunas> Pat this is what you get for playing on Primal so I can't carry you
[1:08:19] <%arcaderabbit48> 430 is fine for Normals if this is your first time doing the raids
[1:08:21] <%Kirijuo> BLM not even in the free 430 gear they give you
[1:08:22] <arkv01> get ready for a spankin from dad
[1:08:33] <jemerald0> Holy shit, get your artifact gear people@
[1:08:40] <+Raspada_Ryner> why does blm have bad gear when you get free 430 gear at lvl 80?
[1:08:41] <$El_Desperad0> Yay, a fun raid
[1:08:43] <xeros720> do your class quests Plague
[1:08:44] <+KoyaMusa> let this serve as a reminder, do weekly things early so you don't get stuck with as many bads
[1:08:46] <%Typhaeon> 430 tells me you don't care about gearing moreso than the ilevel being inadequate
[1:08:47] <Saltmeisterr> can someone explain why car man exists?
[1:08:49] <+Cuon_Alpinus> pat, did you see that Mike Ross is streaming again
[1:08:50] <MSN04_Sazabi> Medica II brother, just what you asked for Kappa
[1:08:55] <%sshen> WHM isn't casting glare or dia
[1:09:04] <%Typhaeon> If you don't care about gearing you don't care about doing your job.
[1:09:06] <%nofestu2> this is some DMC level butt rock
[1:09:10] <%Remery_> @Estuko yea that's how i found out about that band to, and yellowcard from playing burnout. Racing games had good soundtracks back then
[1:09:15] <%Kirijuo> The BLM is also just not casting for like 10 seconds at a time
[1:09:17] <%radda343> you need a healer buddy
[1:09:20] <%QuadraticGravity> Cognition got me to play FF11
[1:09:21] <ittla> rip dragoon

[1:09:35] <tigerfang86> big gamer pat
[1:09:37] <%sshen> this whm is respecting content
[1:09:37] <%CappuccinoGuil> CappuccinoGuil subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! Oh man I can't believe I have been here for half a year. I hope I can get into FF14 sometime before the end of the year. What's a good healing or tank class?

[1:09:49] <%arcaderabbit48> Besides, there's far more wrong here than jsut the iLevels
[1:09:50] <%Owkono> but they said healers should heal only, right?
[1:09:55] <%Typhaeon> Ronkan is trivial to obtain at this point, as is 450 crafted
[1:09:56] <Valdorick> Guys guys guys guys… you won't believe it... the BLM is still alive.

[1:15:01] <+Valison> lb3 soon tho

[1:15:05] <Ser_Randal> Yes
[1:15:06] <%radda343> but sometimes you have to stand in the orange tho
[1:15:07] <jemerald0> @superchronicc dude, this is level 80 content, if someone doesn’t know this shit by now, they will never learn
[1:15:07] <%korth367> that dps had been down whole fight so it doesnt even matter
[1:15:10] <%arcaderabbit48> @Estuko This is endgame, yeah. There is a much harder version of this fight available, but this is endgame for the "average" player
[1:15:11] <%radda343> to avoid the other orange
[1:15:14] <%Lapinelis> Imma be real surprised if you beat this
[1:15:17] <+Rose_Silver> i really wish it did have an enrage, so al the bads couldnt get gear

[1:15:37] <%apostateCourier> this is the best part
[1:15:37] <%TheSniperJoe> Boy do I love watching a White Mage cast "Glare" instead of rezzing or healing.

[1:16:05] <Daniel_Is_I> But yeah in a normal run, titan should be dead by now lol
[1:16:06] <torgairon> @TheSniperJoe if i was healing this i probably wouldn't be wasting rezzes on the blm at this point
[1:16:12] <superchronicc> @jemerald0 i have never even played this game, and know that anything red related is bad

[1:16:17] <$valriot> Toxic is fine when it's aggravated far as I'm concerned
[1:16:18] <%sshen> The SCH is having to solo heal Koya, they don't have time to dps
[1:16:20] <%Typhaeon> spoke too soon
[1:16:21] <+Cuon_Alpinus> should really stop rezzing the blm
[1:16:22] <%apostateCourier> but wait you have other people's effects turned off
[1:16:23] <gustavozxd> is it really that big of a deal if the healer isn't doing damage?

[1:17:19] <QuasarKnightGaming> So how do limit breaks work? I only played this game for like 2 days\
[1:17:21] <%Kirijuo> That's a easy blacklist tbh
[1:17:22] <%sshen> Titan still being THE WALL for bads 6 years on

[1:17:27] <%QuadraticGravity> @Armeggadon Devil's Advocate, Freeze casts a whole second faster than Blizz 3 and can help more with starting up your rotation again after a fuckup.

[1:17:32] <+KoyaMusa> @KnightAsteran i've seen them biolysis occasionally so that's better than nothing but you're right the whm is pretty bad
[1:17:33] <ScarletPrime> @gustavozxd In relevant content, yes. DPS Checks are designed around the Healers actually doing damage between heals.
[1:17:35] <Ser_Randal> Everyone dab on the BLM
[1:17:37] <+Valison> @AngriestPat Now that you've 6 manned this you know you can handle savage LUL
[1:17:41] <%apostateCourier> LB can't save you from bad healers if both healers are dead
[1:17:47] <mike0dude> just LB idiots
[1:17:47] <+OlavOlavsson> your priority should always be dps first then heal when necessary.
[1:17:47] <%Typhaeon> The legendary third car phase

[1:19:40] <Valdorick> I mean, I guess it is impressive that the BLM stayed at his computer, with the hope he'll get to help out on the boss.
[1:19:40] <%arcaderabbit48> Why do people afk on rolls?
[1:19:41] <damienlunas> Lot you assholes

[1:22:05] <Valdorick> Paige woulda been more ill then her sick lines.
[1:22:06] <JDebss> she'd have fallen off the stage
[1:22:09] <QuasarKnightGaming> WAIT. THIS TRACK. Is this a remix from 8?
[1:22:12] <%BoboDaHobo> Australia show was a little lame
[1:22:12] <%apostateCourier> it's a normal FF game except you only control one person and the turns are 2.5 seconds long
[1:22:14] <%Boscuito> at least it aint savage
[1:22:14] <+KoyaMusa> wow pat, you so kind to your abuser, how do you do it
[1:22:16] <torgairon> @arcaderabbit48 i disagree, since they won they won't inflict themselves on any more pugs this week. pat suffered for the greater good of all.
[1:22:18] <QuasarKnightGaming> I love this!! Don't Be Afraid!!
[1:22:18] <+Tarage> Hey guess what I'm playing FFXI right now. Not XIV, XI. I'm playing 11.
[1:22:24] <%Boscuito> what a coincidence
[1:22:26] <+UberWolfman> Yup this is a boss theme remix of 8's boss theme
[1:22:26] <%arcaderabbit48> @QuasarKnightGaming Really good. The story is fantastic, and the gameplay is also very fun with each class feeling very distinct
[1:22:27] <%QuadraticGravity> Yes, it's a remix of the FF8 boss music
[1:22:28] <Bustahhwulf> ff8 boss music?
[1:22:29] <%Boscuito> it is also awful with pugs
[1:22:31] <%LucilleFFXIV> Force Your Way, not Don't Be Afraid

[1:25:14] <gustavozxd> Pat is a high level gamer he can't screw up
[1:25:14] <$Big_King_Coconut> mechanics are for beta dps, not alpha tank
[1:25:14] <+Slayer875> Botchamania!
[1:25:15] <+Silentman0> 1
[1:25:16] <Birdigalore> Is this guy supposed to be an FF8 reference cuz I'm not getting it
[1:25:16] <+Zero_ELEC> Tank fucking adjust.
[1:25:18] <%apostateCourier> you're supposed to actually
[1:25:19] <zepelinnn> you do dumbass
[1:25:20] <%Divryne> You kinda do Pat.
[1:25:20] <+Grizzytron> The one thing you can't ever trust randoms to do is wait
[1:25:22] <+PlagueOfGripes> but you didn't!
[1:25:23] <arkv01> this remix is banging
[1:25:25] <%Divryne> 1
[1:25:27] <zepelinnn> you are supposed to help
[1:25:28] <%QuadraticGravity> Found the guy who doesn't do savage. "I don't have to stack"
[1:25:28] <damienlunas> No there aren't because the other members have AoE markers
[1:25:30] <+Silentman0> @AngriestPat not if there are splits happening at the same time you clown
[1:25:34] <mayorrev> YOU DONT EVEN KNOW
[1:25:37] <%AncelDeLambert> Adjust, Pat
[1:25:38] <mr_slaide> PAT, YOU'RE ALIVE!
[1:25:38] <%apostateCourier> pat
[1:25:39] <BluBox> It's a weak as hell stack
[1:25:40] <+holidayMD> The second stack everyone had to stack
[1:25:40] <%sshen> It's not, it's a nomura designed boss
[1:25:42] <%DavidSanChan> can't believe this streamer didn't even stack up!
[1:25:43] <%apostateCourier> this is why True North exists
[1:25:44] <+RootVeggie> Is this an FF8 remix?
[1:25:46] <ittla> yeah and "healers dont have to dps"
[1:25:48] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> you gigabotched it
[1:25:51] <arkv01> yeah its ff8s boss theme
[1:25:54] <ittla> stack up ya dingdong
[1:25:54] <mr_slaide> We love you, ELMO!
[1:25:55] <+r_Foeburden87> THIS SONG
[1:25:58] <%borkmire> in pugs its best if you stack you are not in your static
[1:26:00] <jemerald0> @birdigalore not at all, he’s just here to introduce another Eden raid main character to the story
[1:26:01] <%crimsonharvest> in my raids it eventually got changed from saying 'stack up' to 'hump up' and now everyone just screams HUMP! in chat
[1:26:03] <%apostateCourier> there's 8 puddles in savage :v
[1:26:11] <QuasarKnightGaming> FF8 is my big favorite, so I guess I probably wouldn't like the hectic nature of 14, but who knows
[1:26:12] <gustavozxd> there's a lot of random ass references to other FFs in this game
[1:26:12] <$Big_King_Coconut> why he run away from stack?
[1:26:13] <Ner234> Did Pat actually fuck up or are we just trolling?
[1:26:17] <%Typhaeon> RIP that guy
[1:26:19] <%MoonObscure> LOL
[1:26:21] <BunnyEmperor> LULW not bad
[1:26:22] <Angry_Ev1L> why pat is such a coward 8( no savages with randoms xenoSleepy
[1:26:22] <torgairon> cog is a good boy
[1:26:24] <%Remery_> No run in circles!
[1:26:25] <+Grizzytron> smooth brain maneuver right there
[1:26:27] <$OmegaWeltall> he refuses to stack LET HIM DIE!!
[1:26:27] <%nmaten> thats my favorite
[1:26:29] <+Silentman0> @Ner234 he fucked up because he doesn't know how this fight works
[1:26:31] <Tomschiii> how should one know that??
[1:26:32] <Valdorick> He popped his cheat death. Good boy, Cog
[1:26:34] <xeros720> real heroes here
[1:26:35] <%Typhaeon> Spell in Jebaited ing
[1:26:36] <SomersaultJustice> quickly, jump and spin around
[1:26:37] <BunnyEmperor> Good ol holmgang
[1:26:42] <+KoyaMusa> oh voidwalker savage is something else
[1:26:42] <%QuadraticGravity> THis fight is a nightmare on savage
[1:26:50] <%sshen> That's for trying to make people in the discord play FFXI
[1:26:51] <ittla> i beat this one pretty quick day 1
[1:26:54] <ittla> its not harrrrd
[1:26:58] <%apostateCourier> @angriestpat now imagine having 4 different kinds of spells-in-waiting going at once
[1:27:00] <%Remery_> I love boss fights in which everyone run in circles screaming
[1:27:10] <ittla> i beat it with pugs
[1:27:14] <gustavozxd> can you blame someone for not knowing how to fight certain bosses if it's their first time?
[1:27:15] <QuasarKnightGaming> pug?
[1:27:16] <+Silentman0> (he was carried is what he's saying)
[1:27:17] <xeros720> this seems easy compared to Titan
[1:27:21] <$Big_King_Coconut> hugs not pugs
[1:27:21] <%Typhaeon> Pugs: the operatic solo
[1:27:21] <+Slayer875> Is it even possible to play FF XI anymore?
[1:27:22] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Like you
[1:27:26] <zepelinnn> nah, day 1 pugs are good
[1:27:26] <%walternatorz> pugs are an abomination against evolution
[1:27:28] <$valriot> I don't how not beating this quick is even a thing????????
[1:27:29] <%sshen> This isn't their first time gustavo, no new player bonus
[1:27:29] <%rdark_ksu> Pug or Corgi?
[1:27:30] <xeros720> oh yeah, you can totally play 11
[1:27:32] <%QuadraticGravity> @Slayer875 I'm literally playing it right now
[1:27:33] <gustavozxd> @slayer875 yep
[1:27:39] <MasterDecoder> Corgi
[1:27:43] <jemerald0> @gustavozxd yes, because these are ALL the same mechanics we’ve been rolling with since ARR
[1:27:43] <BunnyEmperor> This boss Quietus attack is dope af
[1:27:43] <damienlunas> LUL
[1:27:44] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> aren't pugs bred to suffer
[1:27:44] <+Silentman0> 1
[1:27:45] <%undagi> LUL
[1:27:46] <%Divryne> LUL
[1:27:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Pug? Isn't it Pub for Public?
[1:27:47] <ittla> all you have to do with this one is look at the screen
[1:27:47] <+Slayer875> Oh cool
[1:27:48] <%Divryne> EXPOSED.
[1:27:49] <gustavozxd> @sshen nah I just mean in general
[1:27:51] <Valdorick> Pugs are cute, and are squishy, but they also have health problems, and short lives... we're still talking about MMOs, yeah?
[1:27:52] <%LucilleFFXIV> That'd be instant death in Savage :'D
[1:27:52] <zepelinnn> but after 3 days, pugs become trash
[1:27:52] <%Typhaeon> Omnishambles
[1:27:53] <%Remery_> pugs smell funny :/
[1:27:54] <%Boscuito> just eat the stacks
[1:27:56] <%Boscuito> its fine
[1:27:58] <+Slayer875> How?
[1:28:03] <%QuadraticGravity> @AncelDeLambert It's PUG for "pick up group"
[1:28:04] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Is there any reason for Warrior to ever even use the Beast Meter AoE instead of the single target?
[1:28:14] <%arcaderabbit48> Pick Up Groups are fine, if you play earleir in the week. Sunday PUGs are just scrapping the bottom of the barrel with an ice cream scooper
[1:28:15] <Angry_Ev1L> you should try savage with pugs if you like them so much
[1:28:22] <%AncelDeLambert> @QuadraticGravity ... that's dumb
[1:28:23] <jemerald0> @queequegtheater nope
[1:28:24] <+allanvv> if there's enough mobs then aoe attack is better, of course
[1:28:33] <xelomaimhov> Tuesday Pugs are fine.
[1:28:38] <%MoonObscure> OH BOI
[1:28:46] <BunnyEmperor> I like how they noticed and quickly ran back LUL
[1:28:50] <%Remery_> scatter like roaches
[1:28:51] <jemerald0> @queequegtheater Fell Cleave/Inner Chaos is always a better option
[1:28:51] <%QueequegTheater> @allanvv I mean the one that costs Beast Meter, not the normal AoEs
[1:28:56] <%MoonObscure> i do the same thing
[1:28:57] <zepelinnn> day 1 pugs are <3 weekend pugs are monkaS
[1:28:57] <ittla> it's okay i do it too
[1:28:58] <%arcaderabbit48> It feel better, at least
[1:28:58] <$Big_King_Coconut> circle means run away! Kappa
[1:28:58] <QuasarKnightGaming> Limit Break is charged
[1:28:58] <%QueequegTheater> Got it
[1:28:59] <Valdorick> So, how's BLM doing this time? This turret boi doing good? Or is he a sunday BLM?
[1:29:01] <%apostateCourier> sometimes pubbies can hold the panic at bay
[1:29:01] <mr_slaide> It's okay, dps'ers are idiots anyway.
[1:29:03] <+Grizzytron> so glad I'm already at the point where I only need the e4n kill once a week
[1:29:07] <gustavozxd> if you scream hard enough they'll hear you
[1:29:07] <%radda343> does one of the other parts of this raid use Maybe I'm a Lion or Man With a Machine Gun?
[1:29:08] <$shurtal> That's ironing
[1:29:10] <%QuadraticGravity> I have a macro for that stack in waiting that just sends "STAY STACKED <se.2>" like three times
[1:29:10] <+Arcaenum> It feels good saying it out loud though.
[1:29:10] <%Typhaeon> You get too frustaed you'll get frustate cancer
[1:29:12] <%vectorless_peon> apatBig apatHat
[1:29:15] <+Valison> Prostated
[1:29:17] <Tomschiii> normally you should run away from such things but sometimes you have to stay in....its just confusing asf
[1:29:18] <ittla> yelling at the screen keeps you from getting toxic in chat
[1:29:21] <arkv01> talking to the nonexistent pub voice chat is like talking to your cat
[1:29:21] <JonKhan> Pat thats the same feeling as driving behind some asshole who drives like a gods dammened mororn
[1:29:23] <LilacsandFreedom> there's always hope they'll hear you from beyond the internet
[1:29:29] <%Shonen_hero> Quite the achievement for a PUG
[1:29:30] <torgairon> @radda343 nope, first two fights are force your way then the other two are variations on ARR themes
[1:29:34] <Daniel_Is_I> Fuckin love the DRG LB

[1:33:10] <gustavozxd> is Pat not freaking out over the clipping tho?
[1:33:12] <+KoyaMusa> oh your crafters aren't at 80 yet?

[1:34:04] <Ner234> This song is nice. what's it called?
[1:34:06] <Valdorick> Not using materia is just leaving stats on the table for no reason.
[1:34:07] <%QueequegTheater> @zepelinnn No I might need it later

[1:34:36] <Tomschiii> never used materia. just wating to hit 80
[1:34:37] <%Typhaeon> PJSalt averted
[1:34:39] <jemerald0> @ittla you dont need to optimize your character if you’re just casually playing, but adding some extra stats is always fun to see your damage numbers go up

[1:36:39] <gustavozxd> weird music for this but damn SeemsGood
[1:36:40] <Daniel_Is_I> @FriendlyLich Currently the worst dps
[1:36:41] <%arcaderabbit48> @QuasarKnightGaming There is a class that uses Gunblades. They're a tank, and almost all fo their moves are from Squall or Seifer
[1:36:45] <FriendlyLich> FUCK
[1:36:46] <Pastahnak88> ninja is in a crappy spot
[1:36:47] <@Velyndra> @FriendlyLich poop

[1:36:51] <%LucilleFFXIV> NIN mains really dislike NIN currently lol
[1:36:52] <%zamzoph> is this the warned final dungeon?
[1:36:55] <QuasarKnightGaming> I love this Arcade. I love this fact.
[1:36:57] <+Silentman0> i love the lvl 80 dungeons in shadowbringers so much
[1:37:01] <BunnyEmperor> Its not the final one no
[1:37:07] <QuasarKnightGaming> Please tell me their LB's are from 8 too
[1:37:07] <%nofestu2> Naruto run around the monsters
[1:37:08] <+OlavOlavsson> @QueequegTheater seriously all you have to do is rotate your cooldowns. dont pop them all at once
[1:37:09] <+Grizzytron> ninja is getting changed
[1:37:11] <%arcaderabbit48> @FriendlyLich They're underperforming a fair bit currently, and are going to receive some pretty big changes in the next major patch
[1:37:14] <gustavozxd> you're that ninja
[1:37:16] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat they're doing the dancer stuff to ninja mudra's
[1:37:16] <Valdorick> Ninjas right now are very muda muda muda MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDAMUDAMUDA
[1:37:18] <%LucilleFFXIV> @zamzoph optional 80 dungeon, not story related. Set in the final area tho, so still kinda spoilery
[1:37:18] <%thegreatestbambe> When are they making RDM busted
[1:37:20] <%arcaderabbit48> #FuckTrickAttack
[1:37:21] <%thegreatestbambe> I need this
[1:37:22] <%QueequegTheater> @OlavOlavsson But I might need them later for the boss
[1:37:24] <Daniel_Is_I> Hopefully DRG stays exactly the same for the entire expansion
[1:37:25] <+Slayer875> I have no clue to what I'm looking at. But I like it
[1:37:25] <%xemnahort> As someone who is only lvlling tanks to get mentor status big pulls can suck a dick
[1:37:34] <FriendlyLich> @arcaderabbit48 ty for the info buddy
[1:37:35] <+OlavOlavsson> @QueequegTheater believe me, you don't
[1:37:36] <%apostateCourier> RDM is busted for prog :v
[1:37:38] <%ZizerX> drg is so fun
[1:37:44] <$Big_King_Coconut> nerf BLM Kappa
[1:37:44] <%QueequegTheater> @OlavOlavsson But what if I do tho
[1:37:52] <%Faustgesicht> I see Cog has his own response to the stupid hat.'
[1:37:56] <%apostateCourier> DRG is real fun, yeah. Stardiver was an A+ choice for a L80 move
[1:38:01] <%thegreatestbambe> But i wanna shit out tons of damage and keep my utl
[1:38:01] <Valdorick> No bully BLM, fight design and player choices do that enough D:
[1:38:05] <BunnyEmperor> Nice, Cog with the Minos Lux glam
[1:38:06] <%nofestu2> Scottish Samurai
[1:38:06] <jemerald0> @daniel_is_i I would like it they gave Spineshatter Dive the ability to prof Mirage Dive again, but i agree with you
[1:38:06] <Angry_Ev1L> big pulls suck if you healer is braindead and do not DPSing properly
[1:38:09] <%Typhaeon> I'm a perma-DRG - the class was basically perfected between 70-80
[1:38:16] <%Typhaeon> Hard to play anything else
[1:38:17] <+ZoltanBMagnus> what is this song called?
[1:38:18] <%apostateCourier> Agreed, Typhaeon.
[1:38:21] <Tomschiii> i cant even imagine how of a pain it is to lvl a dd
[1:38:25] <Daniel_Is_I> Stardiver is kinda underwhelming honestly. It barely accounts for like 5% of your overall damage.
[1:38:26] <+Nomicro4u> I see a fluffy butt
[1:38:31] <dmtjinni> Early Stream??!? WHAT GIVES???
[1:38:32] <%arcaderabbit48> Big pulls feel great on White Mage, because it makes Afflatus Misery amazing
[1:38:35] <%apostateCourier> I don't care that it's underwhelming damagewise

[1:39:07] <jemerald0> Stardiver will get better at level 90 just like everyone’s 80 ability that can only be used once every 2 minutes
[1:39:22] <$Big_King_Coconut> street sharks!
[1:39:25] <%QueequegTheater> @OlavOlavsson Not having 85%+ health is sub-optimal
[1:39:28] <%Typhaeon> Damage is not absolute top tier but it feels amazing to play
[1:39:30] <Angry_Ev1L> CDs doe not required but eating dungeon TBs RAW is kinda a bad look
[1:39:31] <dredshift> It's a Street Shark!

[1:40:05] <%arcaderabbit48> @Daniel_Is_I That's what I thought. Dragoon was my main DPS in Stormblood, and I've been considering bringing it up for ShB too
[1:40:07] <%ElenaManetta> That's when you know you've hit peak popularity
[1:40:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> Look out its a RED HARRING
[1:40:09] <Tucker0603> mkay man @angriestpat just didn't know if ya needed someone for grouping up
[1:40:16] <tigerfang86> STREET SHARKS YEAH
[1:40:16] <deadbeat34> are those fucking street sharks?
[1:40:19] <Valdorick> But Paige, we like it when Pat looks down at us in disgust, like we're worthless and need to cru~shed underfoot. Hm~m
[1:40:22] <+beardy_foxbear> Thats a lot of street sharks
[1:40:24] <%QueequegTheater> @OlavOlavsson Why would I want to take damage, do I look like a Dragoon

[1:41:01] <MrNoobMcSalt> that rescue was smexy
[1:41:02] <%sshen> Pat, did you see Yakuzies 3 remaster is coming west? got leaked earlier
[1:41:03] <BunnyEmperor> Good rescue
[1:41:04] <+PlagueOfGripes> Pat did nothing wrong to warrant saving his dumb ass
[1:41:04] <%SpcOpsBear> it is 80 degrees in my room (27 Celsius)
[1:41:06] <Daniel_Is_I> @arcaderabbit48 The only complaint I have is that Stardiver doesn't do enough damage for how it looks, but that's hardly an issue. And drg would be broken if they fixed it.
[1:41:12] <%Gogogolem> Pat the last sam moooooo Rai.
[1:41:19] <%SpcOpsBear> had to move to the living room with a better AC
[1:41:33] <+KoyaMusa> if you want to do big damage why are you playing samurai :^)
[1:41:38] <Angry_Ev1L> DRG is broken good already LUL
[1:41:41] <+OlavOlavsson> play monk if you want big damage
[1:41:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> ded
[1:41:46] <%Estuko> @Gogogolem -plays funky theme from boombox-
[1:41:51] <%arcaderabbit48> @Daniel_Is_I Yeah, that's the impression I get. Plus its not like Stardiver is our only big dick DPS move. We still have Geirskogul and Nastrond
[1:41:52] <%MoonObscure> lol
[1:41:53] <fugnuggets01> damn
[1:41:55] <BunnyEmperor> Yeah, go MNK for big damage rn
[1:42:00] <%SpcOpsBear> DRG has never once been nerfed in PvE
[1:42:02] <Valdorick> Just embrace the Turret!
[1:42:07] <%Remery_> I just came back to weird look street sharks :/
[1:42:11] <$valriot> They've said that for 3 years
[1:42:13] <+OlavOlavsson> new monk is hella frigging easy compared to sb monk
[1:42:14] <supuhmagikarp> Think of all the Directionals though
[1:42:18] <%QueequegTheater> DRG is the mascot, of course it's always top tier
[1:42:23] <%arcaderabbit48> I lvoe the creepy radio this place has going on
[1:42:40] <%SpcOpsBear> BioShock 3 is in FF14
[1:42:41] <Pastahnak88> drg was the mascot like 4 years ago
[1:42:43] <%Gogogolem> I am hearing alot of Johns Pat.
[1:42:47] <Boonool> you do any extreme raids yet?
[1:42:49] <$shurtal> Saw a guy with a Sho' 'Nuff shirt on at work a couple days ago, and despite not knowing what Sho' 'Nuff is from, I knew that man was quality.
[1:42:52] <Finaldragoon> Pat going big Rumbo, Rust + Stumbo
[1:42:52] <%arcaderabbit48> Current mascot is Dark Knight
[1:42:59] <%Typhaeon> Big numbers
[1:42:59] <+FutaSnek> @arcaderabbit48 The Piano reminds me of SH tracks
[1:43:03] <%QueequegTheater> DRG is the mascot in my heart
[1:43:10] <%Gray_skies1993> man this jazz theme is catchy
[1:43:11] <%Goobbue> I'm doing the healer role quests rn and it establishes that broken bones can be perfectly healed soon after they break, and why was my first thought that there's probably a lot of people in this world that do that for kink purposes
[1:43:16] <%Remery_> When is it a good time to do damage as a White mage?
[1:43:24] <%korth367> all the time
[1:43:27] <Pastahnak88> all the time
[1:43:27] <+2DSuperiority> when you can
[1:43:28] <%QueequegTheater> @Remery_ Literally all the time
[1:43:31] <torgairon> @Remery_ when people don't need to be healed, which is most of the time
[1:43:34] <Angry_Ev1L> ALL THE TIME
[1:43:37] <%arcaderabbit48> @FutaSnek Yeah, I can see that. Its a very classy soundtrack. Makes me think of some jazz nightclub or something
[1:43:38] <Pastahnak88> healing is for paladins
[1:43:38] <%Estuko> @Goobbue that is painfully true for me.
[1:43:38] <Birdigalore> lOVIN THIS JAZZ
[1:43:39] <%ClericOfSparda> when the tank is at 50%
[1:43:40] <%skizzuto> doing life surge->aoe as dragoon is so satifying. all those crit sounds
[1:43:41] <supuhmagikarp> ALL THE TIME
[1:43:42] <%Gogogolem> Never, shut up an heal
[1:43:43] <+Kurogane_Dread> Afflatus Misery Pog
[1:43:44] <Finaldragoon> remember, Holy is both damage AND mitigation
[1:43:45] <%Remery_> ok thanks xD
[1:43:46] <%zamzoph> healers doing damage?!
[1:43:48] <haveswordmuststing> just play White Mage like a green DPS
[1:43:49] <ScarletPrime> When you see a huge clump of enemies and the Blood Lily demands blood. Then you explode on your numbers LUL
[1:43:50] <Finaldragoon> enjoy those free 10 seconds of stuns
[1:43:53] <Angry_Ev1L> mitigate with damage
[1:43:54] <Daniel_Is_I> @Remery_ Your job as a healer is not to heal. It is to do damage and keep people alive. If they're not about to die, do damage.
[1:43:54] <+TheSaintJohn> You mean when is it good time to do damage as a STONE MAGE
[1:43:57] <haveswordmuststing> 4Head
[1:44:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> why wyould hadies make this?
[1:44:05] <+OlavOlavsson> regen, bubbles etc up, hit that plenary and holy like a madman
[1:44:07] <steelballsdeep> Man my favorite part of the day is to wake up go to work, put in about 3 hours of effort then hide in a random closet and watch pat play ff14
[1:44:08] <%SpcOpsBear> Geomancer
[1:44:11] <%Typhaeon> Giving them vegetables the okra, then the mangoes
[1:44:21] <+Grizzytron> welcome to ffxiv, have you choice of three role archetypes - Red DPS, Blue DPS, and Green DPS
[1:44:22] <%Remery_> @Daniel_Is_I ok thank you, I just don't want to screw up
[1:44:26] <Valdorick> The logical answer is "all the time", the practical answer is "BLM, stop standing in the fucking bad so I can DPS, I do more damage than you anyway, you worthless fuck /toxic"
[1:44:29] <BigDaddy_86> Is this game really worth me dropping the 50 for the game and the 13 a month?
[1:44:33] <%TwentyCXII> TwentyCXII subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:44:36] <QuasarKnightGaming> These cactuars make me sad as well.
[1:44:40] <%apostateCourier> they try so hard to!
[1:44:41] <KVD22> your legs are too small to do the dance
[1:44:43] <%QueequegTheater> @Grizzytron So DRG WAR or WHM then
[1:44:44] <deadbeat34> between the music and the architecture this places are
[1:44:45] <%apostateCourier> but they can't ;-;
[1:44:50] <Kain5707> Audrey 3
[1:44:50] <Angry_Ev1L> just let BLM eat it LUL
[1:44:52] <QuasarKnightGaming> I love my big cactus boiz
[1:44:57] <%xemnahort> When you start as a healer you can sometimes feel ocd about health not being completely full but over time you learn to match the ebb and flow of healing and not healing
[1:44:58] <%apostateCourier> oh hey it's somehow even grosser cu
[1:44:58] <dmtjinni> Health never go down... fun
[1:45:00] <%arcaderabbit48> @BigDaddy_86 Try the free trial first! Its free up to level 35, I beleive
[1:45:01] <$Big_King_Coconut> @BigDaddy_86 do you like the idea of dozens of hours of plot cutscenes?
[1:45:03] <+BringBackSempai> is this a super marlboro
[1:45:13] <+FutaSnek> sayeedLeft mehdiHAX sayeedRight mehdiBAT
[1:45:18] <deadbeat34> Let's try this again, between the music and the architecture this place is Art Deco as fuck.
[1:45:19] <+FutaSnek> I like emotes
[1:45:22] <%apostateCourier> this is, like
[1:45:24] <Daniel_Is_I> @Remery_ It takes some getting used to but after you've been healing for a while you should have a good idea of how much damage is going to be coming in.
[1:45:27] <$Big_King_Coconut> hey look it's void ark boss
[1:45:27] <%apostateCourier> a colony of malboros
[1:45:28] <%arcaderabbit48> This horrible Malboro mutant wasnt nearly as bad as I expected him to be
[1:45:28] <%SpcOpsBear> Yo, anynosy remember Gyromancer? The squenix puzzle battle version of Bejeweled Twist?
[1:45:30] <+Kurogane_Dread> Fun Fact: Square Enix cannot legally use the word "Marlboro" or else they will get sued by Marlboro.
[1:45:32] <ScarletPrime> Just don't be that WHM from E4N earlier that cast 0 damage spells during the whole raid.
[1:45:40] <+Kurogane_Dread> That's why they're all called Morbols
[1:45:42] <BigDaddy_86> I like good story cutscenes...but the combat has to be fun as well
[1:45:48] <%ClericOfSparda> whether the game is worth it is completely dependent on you. there's years worth of content if you like the story and gameplay
[1:45:53] <+rhapsodyinrose> i main SCH and i get mad when i have to gcd heal lol
[1:45:56] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat I didn't realize until I was halfway through the sixth book that there is now a way to skip the ARR relic quests. :(
[1:46:00] <+BringBackSempai> marlboro king
[1:46:07] <%apostateCourier> the conjurer questline- the only healer you can start as- even has you paired with an NPC who refuses to DPS and it's all about how she's wrong
[1:46:09] <%Remery_> @Daniel_Is_I ok, thank you very much. I think I understand now
[1:46:12] <%QueequegTheater> So much wasted time
[1:46:19] <+Tarage> Who put Paige in this game?
[1:46:27] <Ser_Randal> Sing
[1:46:28] <%apostateCourier> they literally teach you that you should do damage as a healer :v
[1:46:29] <%Typhaeon> True North exists
[1:46:31] <dmtjinni> pat stares at my shithole
[1:46:44] <cascadepersona> I would get into FFXIV if not for DQ 11 taking my time
[1:46:45] <dmtjinni> jk dont ban plz
[1:46:46] <Valdorick> This boss attacks with Gahk
[1:46:50] <FriendlyLich> @apostateCourier nah buddy you don't pay my sub :)
[1:47:00] <jemerald0> True North is a fucking Godsend for DRG positionals
[1:47:04] <supuhmagikarp> Well thats a good reason to not like monk
[1:47:05] <Tomschiii> how are the other class quests because the warrior quest is pretty shitty in story and or characters?
[1:47:07] <%Remery_> that juicy cheesesteak sub
[1:47:12] <supuhmagikarp> cause you need that shit
[1:47:21] <%arcaderabbit48> Especially once you get the skill that literally depends on Dragoon positionals toi trigger
[1:47:30] <%thegreatestbambe> does sam have directionals now, or was i just a bad sam this whole time?
[1:47:31] <Daniel_Is_I> @Remery_ A lot of it comes down to how often your tank is using cooldowns. Sometimes you need to heal them if they're not using their cds
[1:47:36] <jemerald0> @tomschiii the Warrior story kicks ass from 50-80
[1:47:47] <%arcaderabbit48> @Tomschiii It varies. A lot. Some are fine, some are terrible, and some are fuckign fantastic
[1:47:48] <Ser_Randal> PLD is pretty shit until the tournament arc
[1:47:49] <%apostateCourier> DRK is the single best
[1:47:49] <supuhmagikarp> warrior 70 is fun
[1:47:49] <+primax104> Hey Pat, hey Chat!
[1:47:50] <+OlavOlavsson> @thegreatestbambe Sam has literally two positionals
[1:47:54] <Pastahnak88> Sam has always had positionals, it's for extra gadge
[1:47:54] <+PlagueOfGripes> Paladin SUCKS
[1:47:57] <BunnyEmperor> What do you mean, WAR in Steppe is cool
[1:47:57] <SomersaultJustice> stormblood warrior quest was fun
[1:47:58] <%Goobbue> but Warrior has LOVE
[1:48:00] <+PlagueOfGripes> gladiator is awesome though
[1:48:00] <jemerald0> @tomschiii Summoner is fun because you fight Ascians
[1:48:02] <%Swampykins> I liked the SCH ones.
[1:48:03] <%QueequegTheater> What WAR is great, they're a bunch of strong dudes who want to get stronger
[1:48:04] <%thegreatestbambe> no wonder i don't remember then
[1:48:05] <FriendlyLich> Aren't Dragoons questline really good?
[1:48:06] <$Big_King_Coconut> MCH is ResidentSleeper
[1:48:06] <gustavozxd> are there any good quests from arr?
[1:48:15] <gustavozxd> like the job/class
[1:48:16] <Valdorick> Ninja Is an episode of Naruto.
[1:48:19] <%VioletHeart> Bard's got a pretty good ARR one.
[1:48:19] <+AXL808> woo! Summoners!
[1:48:20] <Daniel_Is_I> DRG questline is good
[1:48:21] <%VioletHeart> So's Summoner.
[1:48:23] <+KoyaMusa> dragoon's 80 is a heavensward epilogue
[1:48:23] <%SlashHabit> this music is terrible
[1:48:23] <%apostateCourier> dragoon is p good
[1:48:24] <brambobelurkin> God I love this jazz
[1:48:24] <+UberWolfman> Ninja is fun
[1:48:24] <Jdrockefeller> I love 80 pld
[1:48:24] <%Remery_> @Daniel_Is_I so the tanks can heal themselves?
[1:48:30] <%VioletHeart> Dragoon's ARR questline is killer.
[1:48:32] <%ClericOfSparda> whm's are good
[1:48:32] <FriendlyLich> I can confirm Ninjas are an episode of naruto
[1:48:32] <Tomschiii> @jemerald0 i only remember the lovey dovey crap, nothing else
[1:48:34] <+PlagueOfGripes> MCH made me fall asleep until I paid enough attention to get upset
[1:48:40] <+Tarage> The Elmo questline is the best questline.
[1:48:45] <%apostateCourier> Dancer, hilariously, is great
[1:48:52] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Can anyone tell me what the name of this song is?
[1:48:55] <%apostateCourier> and MCH is about arming the populace so that's cool
[1:48:57] <Calern> MCH is about arming the proletariat and it has Hilde, it's rad
[1:48:59] <jemerald0> Dragoon questline is super fun and it’s more fun to do it while playing Heavensward because EVERYBODY refers to you as the Azure Dragoon
[1:49:02] <+primax104> this is some smooth battle music
[1:49:02] <Finaldragoon> Dancer has an amazing payoff for their 80 Quest
[1:49:03] <%apostateCourier> read, arming the little people :v
[1:49:10] <Daniel_Is_I> @Remery_ Paladin can. But I just mean if a tank isn't using their reductions as often as they should, they might not be able to survive without you healing constantly
[1:49:11] <cascadepersona> @angriestpat What's your least favorite class to play?
[1:49:12] <%Typhaeon> Akadaemia Anyder
[1:49:15] <+ZoltanBMagnus> ok thanks! @AngriestPat
[1:49:23] <+primax104> very smooth
[1:49:25] <Ser_Randal> Should they go back and make old content or is that stupid?
[1:49:31] <supuhmagikarp> yeap
[1:49:33] <SomersaultJustice> BOOOOO
[1:49:36] <gustavozxd> and what about the class quests before you start the job quests
[1:49:38] <%ZizerX> too many
[1:49:40] <%Lapinelis> Did you come to like BLM?
[1:49:40] <Forester_Skippy> the name of the ingame scroll for the song is "shadows widrawl"
[1:49:45] <%Lapinelis> Or do you still hate BLMs
[1:49:47] <+Grizzytron> I honestly was not a fan of the ARR dragoon quest line, but then again I did it after I'd already finished heavensward
[1:49:48] <%SlashHabit> nothing more epic than fighting gigantic death knights accompanied by jazz...
[1:49:48] <jemerald0> @tomschiii that’s why Warrior 70 kicks ass! It’s the most hilarious questline in the game. I almost fell out of my chair laughing.
[1:49:49] <%Remery_> @Daniel_Is_I ok gotcha, thank you, been over-healing alot
[1:49:50] <+Fonzies_Jacket> riddle of earth though
[1:49:51] <+Silentman0> they should trim out the more worthless content to be honest
[1:49:54] <Valdorick> He still denies his love of BLM
[1:49:55] <+KoyaMusa> ninja has to be the worst for me, it sucks now
[1:49:55] <+PlagueOfGripes> positionals sounded cool until I realized it was just penalizing me damage for not doing them
[1:49:56] <Angry_Ev1L> I don't think even monk mains like how current monk plays LUL
[1:49:58] <%QueequegTheater> @gustavozxd those are basically all completely meaningless
[1:49:58] <+Silentman0> you could probably cut the titan questline in half
[1:50:02] <%arcaderabbit48> @Grizzytron Its a fucking trip doing that, isn't it?
[1:50:07] <supuhmagikarp> Takes alot of time to Get used to all the positionals
[1:50:09] <+OlavOlavsson> Monk has 90% true north uptime basically
[1:50:11] <FriendlyLich> and make it optional
[1:50:13] <gustavozxd> @queequegtheater good to know
[1:50:16] <+Grizzytron> yeah, but not in a good way?
[1:50:23] <TurtlesAndTentacles> whats the name?
[1:50:23] <Finaldragoon> so to anyone that hasn't seen this dungeon, you're in for a surprise
[1:50:24] <damienlunas> The name of this track is "Shadows Withal" which I found through the eorzeanmusic website
[1:50:25] <%sshen> Damn shame I'll never get that dark pegasus mount
[1:50:28] <%QueequegTheater> @gustavozxd They only last to level 35 and then you get your job
[1:50:28] <Jdrockefeller> I love this dungeon for this music
[1:50:34] <%arcaderabbit48> Monk positionals are actually fine once it becomes clear that half are flank, half are back, and they flow in to each other as part of the combos
[1:50:40] <+Grizzytron> like I feel like I missed something since ARR DRG line ends in a particular way regarding estinien
[1:50:43] <Jdrockefeller> it reminds me of dungeons of dredmor too
[1:50:43] <TurtlesAndTentacles> of the tune
[1:50:49] <$Big_King_Coconut> let's go beat up uh... god
[1:50:50] <+UberWolfman> BIRD U{
[1:50:51] <MrNoobMcSalt> I wish there was a second job crystal for pugilist that was the anti-monk, no positionals, slow but hits like a truck
[1:50:51] <%QueequegTheater> And like a 3rd of the jobs just start as jobs anyway
[1:50:53] <%SpcOpsBear> Time to kill your GF
[1:51:02] <+UberWolfman> BIRD UP
[1:51:04] <%Divryne> Kill the big tiddy dragon girl from Dragon Maid.
[1:51:05] <BunnyEmperor> Pog Quetzalcoatl
[1:51:05] <Cactuskris> ff8
[1:51:05] <+OlavOlavsson> Monk positionals are also super fluid once you get a feel to it
[1:51:05] <QuasarKnightGaming> Hey its FF8 Quetzl!
[1:51:08] <%SpcOpsBear> BIRD UP
[1:51:11] <+Grizzytron> which is jarring considering my recollection of his introduction to the HW MSQ is "yo, he's here and everything's fine"
[1:51:11] <%Gray_skies1993> this theme is pretty great too
[1:51:13] <+RocketBarrel> Time to fight Tam Tam's god
[1:51:16] <Daniel_Is_I> SourPls
[1:51:16] <Thalchampz> time to kill FF8 like it deserves
[1:51:17] <Tomschiii> @jemerald0 whats so hilarious about it? well, aside from the first time the warrior dude got a crush on the warrior girl
[1:51:17] <$Big_King_Coconut> This made me really happy the first time I saw it
[1:51:18] <deadbeat34> awww shit, time fir SB boss music.
[1:51:19] <%QueequegTheater> I don't think this is an accurate representation of Aztec lore
[1:51:20] <Finaldragoon> SourPls

[1:51:22] <%Estuko> SourPls

[1:51:33] <%Estuko> @Divryne best girl
[1:51:34] <FriendlyLich> @QueequegTheater you think LUL
[1:51:37] <jemerald0> NOTICE TO EVERYONE ABOUT POSITIONALS: if you stand directly behind the enemy at maximum melee range, it counts as flank AND rear
[1:51:39] <+Qsmash_> oh hey its that summon from 8
[1:51:42] <%radda343> god this track is sick
[1:51:51] <Tomschiii> its a shame that a punchy class is so meh in a game. :(
[1:51:55] <$Big_King_Coconut> eat da skittles
[1:51:58] <Ser_Randal> The track is banging
[1:51:58] <BunnyEmperor> Boss fights are great with this music
[1:51:58] <+Tarage> @AngriestPat If Paige was a mob in this game what would she be?
[1:52:02] <%SpcOpsBear> @jemerald0 wat
[1:52:06] <+OlavOlavsson> @jemerald0 that's... not how positionals work
[1:52:13] <%Typhaeon> Greedy guts tank
[1:52:16] <jemerald0> I’m dead serious
[1:52:18] <cascadepersona> Did they put FF7 stuff in FFXIV yet?

[1:52:51] <%JLWStreams> Viera DRG looks sick NGL
[1:52:51] <%ZizerX> what a lad
[1:52:55] <%Typhaeon> He's been taking lessons from Urianger
[1:52:58] <BunnyEmperor> Pat suddenly having Don Mheg Rescue Flashbacks
[1:53:03] <Forester_Skippy> it works better on the aoes then that thing but i still respect the rescue
[1:53:05] <+RoByte2> I think he was actually trying to save the DRG, he elusive jumped the wrong way
[1:53:13] <ScarletPrime> I have never had Rescue be used in a positive way on me.
[1:53:16] <%QueequegTheater> @BunnyEmperor What happened in Don Mheg
[1:53:16] <chambatron> Anybody know the name of this song?
[1:53:25] <jemerald0> If I stand there, my special DRG attack that only procs if I do Wheeling Thrust and Fang and Clas at their proper positions always procs
[1:53:27] <%radda343> Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec god of wind, knowledge, and commerce, is a lightning monster in final fantasy. sasuga japan.
[1:53:29] <%ClericOfSparda> I have only ever rescued once and it was on accident
[1:53:30] <+Tarage> It's the boss fight song for Shadowbringers
[1:53:30] <%Ascethetic> insatiable
[1:53:34] <BunnyEmperor> @QueequegTheater WHM rescued him across the pit at the final boss and he fell down
[1:53:43] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[1:53:51] <jemerald0> If you don’t believe me, grab your Dragoon and test it
[1:54:00] <$Big_King_Coconut> can you use arms length to stop getting knocked back there?
[1:54:03] <jemerald0> I have hard evidence
[1:54:12] <FriendlyLich> @radda343 also he is a feathered serpent, but I see no serpent
[1:54:13] <QuasarKnightGaming> LB is ready,
[1:54:14] <%QueequegTheater> Pat just LB
[1:54:16] <+Grizzytron> iirc arm's length doesn't work on that one
[1:54:17] <Finaldragoon> no, Arms Length/Surecast doesn't work on that knockback
[1:54:18] <%Typhaeon> I don't think Arm's Length works for that
[1:54:23] <KVD22> WE FALL
[1:54:26] <Finaldragoon> you can gap closer after the knockback
[1:54:29] <FriendlyLich> @chambatron Shadows Withalits the name of the song I think
[1:54:31] <%SpcOpsBear> guaranteed knockback
[1:54:31] <Forester_Skippy> cant use artms length but you can stop the knockback with a hard welltimed dash
[1:54:34] <BunnyEmperor> LB disrespect
[1:54:37] <fugnuggets01> LB
[1:54:43] <+Valison> Will anyone remember to LB LUL
[1:54:46] <%QueequegTheater> lb coward
[1:54:55] <$Big_King_Coconut> LB is a crutch for bad players Kappa
[1:54:55] <+Grizzytron> waiting for dps to dps means not using lb
[1:55:00] <+Tarage> @AngriestPat If Paige were a mob in this game what would she be?
[1:55:01] <+Silentman0> why did he roll on it if he didn't want it
[1:55:03] <Valdorick> They're not Limit Broken.
[1:55:05] <ScarletPrime> LB is to important to ever use!
[1:55:06] <jemerald0> The positional trick works on Monks as well when at the front of the boss
[1:55:09] <+Valison> I guess not
[1:55:14] <QuasarKnightGaming> FF8 Ballroom theme?!
[1:55:15] <Acidshocker> Nice, I just got here when he did it!
[1:55:19] <%arcaderabbit48> @Silentman0 You can Pass on gear to roll an automatic 0
[1:55:19] <Boonool> have you done any extreme raids yet
[1:55:21] <%QueequegTheater> what if Pat needs the LB for a different dungeon later

[1:58:18] <%Estuko> Can you imagine using Rescue in real life? and how people would absolutely use that shit for murder like during traffic or in planes
[1:58:18] <Lurantis_> Pats going to go murder her so he can finally get a good night’s rest
[1:58:19] <jemerald0> @mysticember91 I’m dead serious. If you move too close it doesn’t work, but every time I’ve done it, I always get my Raiden Thrust to proc
[1:58:34] <Pastahnak88> anyone know if pat has tried savage yet?
[1:58:52] <Valdorick> But Elmo is the screamer.
[1:59:02] <Valdorick> How does kill Paige give good sleep?
[1:59:03] <%SpcOpsBear> @jemerald0 No dude, Raiden Thrust might actually be bugged right now.
[1:59:05] <Finaldragoon> nice network error, thanks Twitch
[1:59:05] <+Tarage> Elmo stream.
[1:59:05] <+EVA_Unit02> Destiny time?
[1:59:06] <+2DSuperiority> starB bed burger for Paige
[1:59:08] <haveswordmuststing> @estuko maybe it could combo into launcher if that doesnt work
[1:59:11] <%Zombino924> Zombino924 gifted a Tier 1 sub to TrevyWeaponsGuy! They have given 2 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[1:59:16] <@BigNaturalMan59> !raffle
[1:59:18] <%Nobrev> I don't think pat even wants to do savage
[1:59:23] <+Tarage> Now that Paige is asleep Pat can buy all the things.
[1:59:45] <Valdorick> Now that Pat is up, we should just start saying "We're talking a little low" every 5 minutes, until she yells at him again.
[1:59:48] <%arcaderabbit48> Savage isnt really worth it for the amount of pain and suffering you ahve to endure
[1:59:49] <%Das_Bass> lootbox stream
[1:59:54] <%SpcOpsBear> I have gottten it to proc when using True North but missed the first positional before popping it
[1:59:58] <Valdorick> Now that Piage is asleep*
[1:59:59] <%NWR_James> Paige is asleep, post cumblebees
[2:00:06] <+Tarage> I have a question. Why is Elmo named Peepee on the animation?
[2:00:08] <%JLWStreams> MercyWing1 apatElmo MercyWing2
[2:00:18] <%NWR_James> @Tarage nickname she has for him
[2:00:27] <jemerald0> @spcopsbear no, positionals are bugged. I have a friend who plays Monk and he tested its positional moves too and got the same result
[2:00:29] <haveswordmuststing> @tarage paige was drunk one night and said hi mr peepee
[2:00:44] <%mckraven> @Tarage Cause Paige came home drunk one night and just started calling him peepee so that's his nickname now
[2:00:44] <Valdorick> Also, he was covered in his own piss when she got him.

[2:01:08] <%arcaderabbit48> @Tarage VoltaBass
[2:01:12] <Valdorick> Volta...bass?
[2:01:21] <%arcaderabbit48> Like an electrified fish
[2:01:27] <haveswordmuststing> @valdorick yes... thats his name
[2:01:29] <%zamzoph> @Tarage And was this person paid?
[2:01:32] <Lurantis_> Man I wish nintendo would do super famicom themed joycons
[2:01:45] <$valriot> Volta Bass you also does Paiges, and Max and Clemps YouTube intro
[2:01:56] <Valdorick> Good... good... I can at least spell names right.
[2:01:56] <haveswordmuststing> @lurantis_ assuming they even have snes roms to sell LUL
[2:01:57] <%SpcOpsBear> @lurantis_ the rumor mill saya they're doing just that
[2:02:06] <Saltmeisterr> I wish Nintendo would let us play snes games
[2:02:06] <+Slayer875> They might be doing snes controller joycons like the nes controllers
[2:02:11] <Lurantis_> @spcopsbear WOOP
[2:02:19] <+Tarage> You know it's funny how much Paige lusts after skeletons yet she's with a guy who has a small skeleton and it's hidden so deeply under fat.
[2:02:24] <Saltmeisterr> instead of shitty nes games
[2:02:28] <%SpcOpsBear> and maybe adding SNES games to Nintendo online just like the NES stuff
[2:02:46] <%Estuko> He was paid in Bison Dollars
[2:02:49] <Lurantis_> All I want is to have a GBA virtual console
[2:02:49] <Saltmeisterr> hopefulley
[2:02:51] <haveswordmuststing> snes games would automatically justify the 20 a year
[2:02:54] <+Slayer875> Maybe then I'll sub to online

[2:02:58] <jemerald0> @spcopsbear if it turns out to just be Raiden Thrust, then I’ll admit that I’m 100% wrong
[2:03:12] <Lurantis_> I mean $20 a year is still demonstrably cheaper than PSN or Xbox live
[2:03:15] <Lurantis_> Ps+
[2:03:28] <Saltmeisterr> gba virtual console would be sick
[2:03:55] <%SpcOpsBear> Wii U is still a thing, guys...
[2:03:59] <haveswordmuststing> @lurantis_ i know, but the standerd set is Killer Instinct season 1 and 2 for xbox live that one month
[2:04:01] <%SpcOpsBear> LUL
[2:04:07] <Saltmeisterr> @Lurantis_ sure its 20 bucks but u are barely getting anything from it
[2:04:10] <haveswordmuststing> thats a good ass deal
[2:04:11] <%DavidSanChan> i'll miss her

[2:06:50] <Lurantis_> Wondering if you could use a gameboy micro shell for a retropi, or if it’s too small
[2:06:57] <Roz_Lynd> hiya patrick! hope you're doin will. hope paige is gettin her rest! just stopped in to say hiiiiiii
[2:06:57] <xeros720> alternatively, leveling up crafting
[2:06:58] <mr_slaide> @SpcOpsBear NOOOOOOOOO!!!!
[2:07:03] <BunnyEmperor> And then Pat will do Ultimate
[2:07:04] <%SpcOpsBear> Don't admit you're shitposting!
[2:07:06] <%Mega_Pengers> fair enough, know a few people do that
[2:07:08] <+KoyaMusa> 5 jobs away from amaro, still have to do ninja
[2:07:16] <$Big_King_Coconut> crafting DansGame
[2:07:19] <%ElenaManetta> There's a lot to do in every big MMO, that's why they're so damn intimidating
[2:07:22] <%zamzoph> Is there a room in FF14 that DOESN'T have a vaulted ceiling?
[2:07:23] <+Tarage> Don't level crafting, it's a trap.
[2:07:27] <%CaptainKarite> 9/17 at 80 for me
[2:07:27] <xeros720> wow, didn't know getting that amaro was so hard, i figured it was a story reward
[2:07:28] <%Das_Bass> use a broken GBA for a retro pi
[2:07:33] <%sshen> Best way to level crafting is to just find a crafter who'll sell you levekits right?
[2:07:49] <kindashagg> So you have a rotation?
[2:07:50] <MrNoobMcSalt> in summary, number go up
[2:07:51] <+Grizzytron> I'm finally stepping into gather classes this weekend
[2:07:52] <%walternatorz> from one time vampire to the other time vampire
[2:07:54] <+Grizzytron> I wanna die
[2:07:57] <%BlueMoonBlues> hope you get orbonne
[2:07:58] <%zamzoph> @AngriestPat So you like dressup?
[2:07:58] <%riantDeliration> i relate to this
[2:07:58] <xeros720> 100%, i geared up for the raid in Destiny 1: Taken King, and just immediately quit
[2:08:00] <mr_slaide> PAt, just admit you're going to play WoW classic full time.
[2:08:00] <+KoyaMusa> number go up good
[2:08:03] <+BringBackSempai> Why get a GBA when you could just set up emulators on a RasPi and then never shut the fuck up about it?
[2:08:04] <Lurantis_> GBA/SP are kinda bulky in the pocket compared to a micro though
[2:08:09] <BunnyEmperor> For me it's the complete opposite, I like the challenge
[2:08:11] <%Mega_Pengers> i get that actually
[2:08:13] <+Silentman0> actually using the top level gear? fuck that
[2:08:14] <Valdorick> Forma is literal PatCrack.
[2:08:19] <%arcaderabbit48> I just grind up my iLevel just enough that I can do the next story quests when the new patch lands.
[2:08:19] <+Grizzytron> people still bail from orbonne
[2:08:20] <Forester_Skippy> raids are really good in this game but boy i get burned out so fast with pugging
[2:08:20] <%Das_Bass> Taken King was a bad raid too
[2:08:22] <BunnyEmperor> ORBONNE YES
[2:08:23] <mr_slaide> OH shit
[2:08:24] <%BlueMoonBlues> OH NO

[2:08:47] <%sshen> THUNDER GOD TIME
[2:08:48] <+lemurbreeder> did you expect a modicum of rust
[2:08:49] <BunnyEmperor> This Alliance Raid must never die
[2:08:49] <%SwdVengeance> Thunder god wiped incoming
[2:08:50] <+TONYOO101> what's wrong with orbornne, i thought it was pretty fun
[2:08:50] <+2DSuperiority> I remember doing orbonne with you and all off Alliance B leaving
[2:08:51] <%korth367> Thunder Chad fuck yeah
[2:08:53] <RoxyRhapsody> I've been listening to your vods to pass the time at work; nice to finally catch a stream!
[2:08:54] <$Big_King_Coconut> is this the third SB raid?
[2:08:54] <jemerald0> Immediate disband
[2:08:55] <ittla> nothing is as bad as ct
[2:08:56] <%Nobrev> oh boy I've run this multiple times and I still don't know how shit works
[2:09:02] <supuhmagikarp> I think Dun Scathe is worse
[2:09:03] <%riantDeliration> is this like Aurum Vale then
[2:09:11] <+EmiinV> oh hey gang
[2:09:13] <$OmegaWeltall> its FF14 EVERYONES BAD!!!!
[2:09:13] <Daniel_Is_I> I just drop my ilvl so I only get Labyrinth/Syrcus from alliance roulette
[2:09:13] <%sshen> THUNDER
[2:09:14] <supuhmagikarp> but i love Dun scathe
[2:09:15] <BunnyEmperor> inb4 Vote Abandon at Thunder God Cid LUL
[2:09:15] <+EmiinV> it's my favorite 24man
[2:09:20] <%Ilpala> this is wiping city if no one got better at wiping city
[2:09:21] <+Grizzytron> well yeah everyone's 80 and now think it's supposed to magically become a joke like crystal tower
[2:09:21] <ScarletPrime> This reminds me that I need to actually run the Stormblood Alliance Raids now that I'm level 70.
[2:09:25] <%zamzoph> orange things bad
[2:09:26] <+Grizzytron> they're wrong, but they still think it
[2:09:28] <$Big_King_Coconut> "Stand in orange things"... ok, got it
[2:09:28] <Renuarb> SB Raids are suffering the same fate that HW did. People CANNOT do them because they're spoiled on Syrcus Tower. The Nier Raids cannot come soon enough
[2:09:29] <Forester_Skippy> with all the buffs and how easy it is to hit max ilvl for level 70 you would expect people to not hit enrages
[2:09:30] <+UberWolfman> Dun Scathe was so bleehhh
[2:09:34] <%thegreatestbambe> @AngriestPat you're hat looks stupid, sorry not sorry
[2:09:39] <Finaldragoon> there are some things in the game where people are legit brain dead, A11 for example. 4 year old content, people have no idea how to not die in it
[2:09:40] <%radda343> but pat what about the orange things you have to stand in
[2:10:02] <$Big_King_Coconut> this is the third SB 24-man right?
[2:10:06] <+KoyaMusa> basically, do mechanic, then do damage
[2:10:06] <%skizzuto> it looks stupid, but like, in a good way
[2:10:06] <%korth367> @AngriestPat specify your CHARACTER has to look away, not the camera
[2:10:09] <%DedlokPM> apatHat
[2:10:10] <%JLWStreams> FFT has the best music.
[2:10:10] <+Grizzytron> @Big_King_Coconut yes
[2:10:17] <%DavidSanChan> pat's character is a golf caddy
[2:10:22] <BunnyEmperor> I want Pat to wear a beret in real life
[2:10:22] <SoySocks> when the enemies do the gaze, do you have to face the camera away from them, or just your player character?
[2:10:25] <%zamzoph> @AngriestPat is it possible to do a boss without reading a book first?
[2:10:28] <SoySocks> ah perfect
[2:10:31] <mr_slaide> Yeah, Orbonne is basically the equivalent of WoW Oculus in terms of people sucking at it.
[2:10:32] <%arcaderabbit48> @SoySocks Just your character
[2:10:39] <supuhmagikarp> Why not Both?
[2:10:43] <SomersaultJustice> Mustard Banana
[2:10:45] <%Owkono> just close your eyes
[2:10:47] <+EmiinV> mustadio actually being useful instead of in fft rangel2Clamp
[2:10:47] <gustavozxd> close your eyes look away from the screen
[2:10:47] <Valdorick> Aw man, there's a good size spread in these raids now that bunny girls are pulling from the catgirl crowd.
[2:10:49] <ScarletPrime> I'd hope people learn that Gazes are scary after they run WoD for the first time and get Doom'd by Mortal Gaze.
[2:10:56] <+Silentman0> @zamzoph most boss mechanics are more or less the same, but used differently
[2:10:57] <BunnyEmperor> OR just do what everyone else does...
[2:10:59] <xeros720> both those Eden fights pat did seemed pretty straight forward
[2:11:01] <ShichiNoBushi> Player gets petrified.
[2:11:02] <%Divryne> If you don't look at the screen with your eyes you won't get hit apatDab
[2:11:02] <SailingSaturn> its so cool wiping on the first day though cirGasm

[2:11:35] <Valdorick> Mustadio achieved his final form, and became a robot
[2:11:36] <+louiswho> the machinist became a machine
[2:11:38] <%dekkitout> "I cast G U N!"
[2:11:43] <%DedlokPM> Why does he sound like Soundwave?
[2:11:48] <+jordanstayshome> @AngriestPat I know D2 is later but on the subject of raids have you given consideration to attempting the year 2 raids? Last Wish and SoTP are fantastic.
[2:11:49] <kehnimentu> dont you mean larboard and starboard handgonne
[2:11:49] <SomersaultJustice> so he's gonna switch to widowmaker in the middle and screw the team
[2:11:51] <ScarletPrime> Yeah. The mechanics are pretty universal in most stuff. Just remixes on the way they get played out.
[2:11:52] <AfroKing24> SourPls
[2:11:57] <+KoyaMusa> also in alliance raids, please don't fight over enmity as tanks please
[2:11:57] <+louiswho> god i fucking love this music
[2:11:58] <%vaporousTippler> Mustadio is a Xenogears now.
[2:11:59] <Forester_Skippy> lardboard handgun you say?
[2:12:01] <kindashagg> aw that's dope
[2:12:04] <KatabolicRage> just gotta learn what castbars to watch out for
[2:12:07] <jemerald0> @dedlokpm he’s literally talking through a pipe organ
[2:12:07] <+xGreenflame> But what about larboard handgun?
[2:12:12] <+Qsmash_> is this music from another game?
[2:12:16] <xeros720> if it said port or starboard handgun, that'd be hilarious
[2:12:17] <%DedlokPM> Port and Starboard. Got it.
[2:12:23] <+louiswho> final fantasy tactics @Qsmash_

[2:13:23] <Valdorick> Oh no, he's become Xigbar from KH2!
[2:13:26] <mayorrev> How come he has a gun and you guys dont
[2:13:27] <$Big_King_Coconut> don't like that!
[2:13:28] <BunnyEmperor> SCH demonstrating how not to do it

[2:13:29] <@CreepyPorpoise> I don't have my abilities set on my bars for SCH
[2:13:31] <%Unlimited_> rip porp
[2:13:35] <@CreepyPorpoise> woopsy
[2:13:35] <%Goobbue> I never actually did this raid, the first two tiers were extremely boring to me, is this worth going back for
[2:13:36] <+EmiinV> "aiming for weakness" "show him the open spot"
[2:13:38] <%riantDeliration> this is a neat boss
[2:13:40] <%Gray_skies1993> @Valdorick oh god not again lol
[2:13:44] <%arcaderabbit48> @mayorrev Because Pat isnt playing the Gun class
[2:13:44] <+2DSuperiority> rezzed in the mines LUL
[2:13:46] <%DedlokPM> @jemerald0 then why doesn't he sound like he is playing In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida?
[2:13:46] <%zamzoph> @Valdorick but uncensored Kappa
[2:13:48] <ShichiNoBushi> The.... END.....
[2:13:52] <%sshen> I love the drama in alliance raids, it's so full of petty bullshit
[2:13:56] <garbageheaphound> rezzed into mines thas rough
[2:14:00] <%apostateCourier> ofc the rdm is down
[2:14:17] <+RootVeggie> oh, this guy is named after the FF Tactics dude
[2:14:22] <%apostateCourier> yes
[2:14:25] <%apostateCourier> he IS that dude
[2:14:32] <%arcaderabbit48> Actually this guy is that Tactics dude
[2:14:32] <mayorrev> there's a gun class? what do they have specifically, rifles? @arcaderabbit48
[2:14:34] <%Ilpala> BIG WHOOPS
[2:14:34] <%sshen> why did I read the name as mustarddip
[2:14:35] <BunnyEmperor> LUL Mentor Pat
[2:14:36] <%radda343> sasuga crazy talk
[2:14:38] <+2DSuperiority> This whole raid is full of FFT
[2:14:42] <tigerfang86> they have the GUNBLADE
[2:14:45] <ovan20> @AngriestPat today i just went through eden's gate for the first time, it's only 4 stages on that raid? i finished them, but the story isn't even near finishing.
[2:14:45] <tigerfang86> the COOLEST WEAPON EVER MADE
[2:14:48] <+RootVeggie> wait what, is this some kind of alternate dimension shit?
[2:14:48] <%apostateCourier> no, there's just gun
[2:14:50] <ShichiNoBushi> He actually reminds me of Xigbar.
[2:14:50] <+KoyaMusa> pat don't say that you haven't got to cid yet
[2:14:52] <%apostateCourier> and then there's also gunblade
[2:14:57] <+Silentman0> gun class also has robot
[2:15:02] <%Estuko> @tigerfang86 Wielding a gunblade made me significantly more attracted to Squall LUL
[2:15:04] <%arcaderabbit48> @mayorrev Large handguns or rifles, as well as flamethrowers, drills, bombs, turrets, a giant robot you summon like a Stand, and lasers
[2:15:11] <+Grizzytron> love the in-game canon that guns came after gunblades
[2:15:11] <KatabolicRage> 8man raids come out across several patches dude,
[2:15:12] <mayorrev> sick
[2:15:16] <%apostateCourier> there's also one normal sized handgun
[2:15:18] <Valdorick> RIP group 2 healer.
[2:15:19] <KatabolicRage> there'll be three sets of 4 in the end
[2:15:22] <%sshen> @ovan20 the edens raid will go on for another 8 stages, 4 per each with more story
[2:15:25] <%apostateCourier> the makai hand mortar :v
[2:15:37] <+rhapsodyinrose> God I can't wait for the nier 24-mans
[2:15:55] <+Silentman0> you can't see, but this is 1/6 for this raid wing
[2:15:56] <deadbeat34> I just came back, is that an orbital frame?
[2:15:58] <%Gray_skies1993> I have to admit this is a pretty damn awesome boss fight imo

[2:16:04] <tigerfang86> @Estuko having a gunblade was what let me get more into squall and learning about his actual character lol
[2:16:14] <SailingSaturn> imagine a Rhythm game in the Nier Raids LUL
[2:16:20] <ovan20> @sshen thanks. After finishing it on normal, how do i unlock the savage version?
[2:16:23] <%zamzoph> it's like the chacha slide attack
[2:16:24] <Kain5707> you just need to have the open part facing him always
[2:16:29] <+Slayer875> I forgot about the Nier raid. Now I must get back into 14
[2:16:33] <transporterthesequel> Imagine HACKING in the Neir raids
[2:16:33] <%arcaderabbit48> @SailingSaturn We are all Dancers now
[2:16:34] <+Slayer875> Fucking dammit
[2:16:37] <tigerfang86> oh yeha Nier content is happening
[2:16:37] <%Estuko> @tigerfang86 mained the fuck out of him in Dissidia, 012, and now Opera Omnia. trying to get his military outfit, so handsome in it NotLikeThis
[2:16:40] <tigerfang86> I hope it's dumb AF
[2:16:41] <%skizzuto> nier raid is totally gonna have shmup segments
[2:16:59] <Valdorick> Imagine if in the middle of the Nier raid, it becomes a 24man twitch plays pick your own text adventure.
[2:17:00] <xeros720> oh man, you're totally right
[2:17:01] <+Tarage> Nier raid is going to have a fashion contest.
[2:17:04] <Forester_Skippy> i hope they bring back the byakko orbs but nextlevel it
[2:17:06] <MrNoobMcSalt> oh god I just realized the quality of music we're going to get in the Nier 24 mans
[2:17:06] <+RootVeggie> I really really want to get into FF14 but traditional MMO combat just doesn't do it for me

[2:17:12] <+Silentman0> i hope the nier raid has a sound novel segment
[2:17:12] <tigerfang86> I also mained him in dissidia 012 lmao, I just really like that classic fur coat
[2:17:13] <%DedlokPM> @skizzuto It's totally going to have Bullet Hell segment
[2:17:14] <xeros720> and everyone is gonna need to dodge bullets
[2:17:15] <%DedlokPM> s
[2:17:16] <%zamzoph> is the Nier raid gonna have new Nier music?
[2:17:24] <+rhapsodyinrose> We better have a text adventure minigame in the nier raid
[2:17:28] <tigerfang86> ^^^^
[2:17:29] <SoySocks> what does "Reth farwell" mean at the top?
[2:17:31] <+Slayer875> I mean, the boy himself is helping to develop it
[2:17:33] <%arcaderabbit48> The FF14 remix of Song of the Ancients is going to be absurd
[2:17:41] <xeros720> probably a remix by the FF sound team, probably multiple
[2:17:45] <+EmiinV> Reth Farewell is the target of Mustadio @SoySocks
[2:17:45] <%radda343> @SoySocks that's who the boss is targeting
[2:17:46] <BunnyEmperor> Monster Hunter also had the soundtrack in it
[2:17:49] <+Grizzytron> @SoySocks that's who the boss is currently targeting
[2:17:52] <%Nobrev> @SoySocks that's the player pat's target is targeting
[2:17:53] <%arcaderabbit48> @SoySocks The name of the person the boss is currently attacking with his basic attacks
[2:17:54] <SoySocks> ah okay. thank you!
[2:17:57] <tigerfang86> JUDGEMENT C UT
[2:17:59] <Forester_Skippy> @SoySocks thats the guy currently with the msot agro tnaking the boss
[2:18:00] <kindashagg> There had better be with a girl with a dick and good character who eats it in that NieR raid
[2:18:01] <tigerfang86> Pat did a JUDGEMENT CUT
[2:18:02] <%zamzoph> no Nier composer? :(
[2:18:12] <%Estuko> BibleThump o7
[2:18:15] <xeros720> i honestly expect Emil there, more than anyone else
[2:18:23] <+Slayer875> Judgement cut? Nah, Judgement N U T
[2:18:25] <%Estuko> NEKKID
[2:18:27] <%SlowLikeThunder> It's a shame that running Orbonne is such a nightmare sometimes it's like my favorite dungeon in the game
[2:18:32] <ovan20> that was just a common boss? D:
[2:18:34] <Kain5707> judgement vargNut
[2:18:38] <%zamzoph> @xeros720 or devolva/popola
[2:18:48] <DracaenaLeaf> 1 2 or 3?
[2:18:48] <BunnyEmperor> Drakengarde ofc
[2:18:48] <mr_slaide> Autotomato
[2:18:50] <%apostateCourier> I doubt it
[2:18:52] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> u know nothing
[2:18:52] <notToph> that'd be sick
[2:18:52] <Valdorick> Hmmm... in an alliance raid, is the limitbreak per party, or the entire raid?
[2:18:53] <+Qsmash_> Is Nier cannon to XIV?
[2:18:55] <+2DSuperiority> Papa Nier better show
[2:18:57] <gustavozxd> there's gonna be THREE?
[2:18:57] <tigerfang86> DRAKENGARD RYTHM RAID
[2:18:58] <KatabolicRage> it sure isn't
[2:18:59] <tigerfang86> PLZ
[2:19:00] <Ser_Randal> Yeyeyeyyeyeyeye
[2:19:01] <mayorrev> can you dress your character like 2B?
[2:19:02] <+Silentman0> my theory is that accord is the one who is going to onboard us onto the raid story
[2:19:02] <xeros720> fuck, that'd be pretty sweet
[2:19:03] <ShichiNoBushi> "Wiccha! Pucchu! Wiccha!!" Pat's in game character is actually saying this.
[2:19:04] <KatabolicRage> the nier raids are gonna be wierd
[2:19:04] <%MightyMaxT> All will be canon, I presume? Kappa
[2:19:04] <%Voidwyvern> Limit is per party
[2:19:05] <MaeMae94> @Qsmash_ it is now
[2:19:05] <ittla> there's always 3
[2:19:06] <+RootVeggie> Big bot butts
[2:19:06] <%dekkitout> So in order of most well know to least Nier
[2:19:07] <Tucker0603> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:19:08] <Calern> they can also make new stuff
[2:19:09] <+UberWolfman> Arigas Kreygasm
[2:19:09] <%arcaderabbit48> @Valdorick Per party, so you actually have 3 Limits
[2:19:10] <mr_slaide> Devola and Popola.
[2:19:11] <+louiswho> oh my god agrias
[2:19:11] <BunnyEmperor> Drakengard is not far fetched
[2:19:11] <+KoyaMusa> rhythm game boss in drakengard raid
[2:19:14] <Futurecity10> The Drakenguard raid is just a rhythem game
[2:19:14] <%Goobbue> I've never played Nier oops. I wonder if I can before the raid is out
[2:19:15] <%sshen> GO TIME
[2:19:18] <%Nobrev> I dunno. it's called yorha apocalypse not nier apocalypse @AngriestPat
[2:19:20] <mudai> will the nier raids be level 80 raids? I'm only level 60 so far ;__;
[2:19:22] <%Ranryu692> Will the NieR stuff be permanently missable?
[2:19:22] <umbrus89> i love this boss
[2:19:29] <KatabolicRage> the new raids will be at the new level cap yes
[2:19:29] <+Grizzytron> Isn't the whole crossover thing called "YoRHa: Dark Apocalypse," implying N:A primarily?
[2:19:31] <%vaporousTippler> I love how that is still clearly Save the Queen.
[2:19:33] <$OmegaWeltall> i love her quotes here
[2:19:35] <jemerald0> Agrias is so fucking cool!
[2:19:35] <+2DSuperiority> @Ranryu692 nope, it will stay
[2:19:37] <+Qsmash_> I def spelled canon wrong
[2:19:38] <%apostateCourier> desert/forest/ruins/whitespace/space station/foundry
[2:19:38] <%arcaderabbit48> @mudai Yes, they will be level 80
[2:19:38] <xeros720> yeah, they are gonna level 80, still got a month or two, Eden Extreme isn't out yet, i don't think
[2:19:39] <Forester_Skippy> the tank set she wears that drops here is great tho
[2:19:39] <+Silentman0> @mudai yeah, but you probably have until october to level up
[2:19:41] <%apostateCourier> there's a lot of options
[2:19:42] <%Nobrev> @Ranryu692 permanent raid
[2:19:58] <mudai> @arcaderabbit48 @Silentman0 thanks. so I guess they will be time limited. I better speed up then
[2:20:00] <%zamzoph> I had to do Drakengard's last boss with a guide and Drakengard's 3 last boss following a video NotLikeThis
[2:20:01] <%Divryne> NERD.
[2:20:02] <BunnyEmperor> Lifts up shield -> Dodge
[2:20:03] <+KoyaMusa> remember you can't move or the shield will dissapate
[2:20:10] <+Silentman0> @mudai nope, it'll be in the game forever
[2:20:12] <Ser_Randal> JUDGEMENT BLADE
[2:20:14] <ittla> wow agrias as a boss. i havent done this one yet
[2:20:16] <ittla> god dam
[2:20:22] <mudai> @Silentman0 oooh, ok. thank you so much, this is great news!
[2:20:24] <+Slayer875> I assume I'll need Shadowbringers for the raid
[2:20:28] <%arcaderabbit48> @mudai Oh no, the Raids are permanent. Pat is doing a raid form the last expansion right now. You jsut have to be at least level 80 to get in
[2:20:39] <mayorrev> gay baby jail
[2:20:40] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> @angriestpat have you, or will you give Black Desert a try?
[2:20:40] <%Frubblord> @Slayer875 this ones a stormblood raid
[2:20:40] <jemerald0> 70
[2:20:40] <%arcaderabbit48> @Slayer875 Have it and beat it, yes
[2:20:41] <BunnyEmperor> I hate it when this happens when you play as BLM
[2:20:41] <Valdorick> "Zero?" "Yeah?" "It was really-" <GAAAAAAAH>
[2:20:42] <%Svanyr> Shadow realm!
[2:20:46] <mudai> @arcaderabbit48 thank you, that's great to hear
[2:20:53] <+Slayer875> I meant the Nier stuff
[2:20:53] <%zamzoph> just use ad blocker 4Head
[2:21:00] <%Frubblord> @Slayer875 oh sorry
[2:21:07] <%dekkitout> So Atheon from Vault of Glass is just this
[2:21:13] <+Slayer875> It's cool. I shoulda specified
[2:21:27] <+Tarage> So with Pat saying this dungeon is pug hell... can we count this as Crazy Talk?
[2:21:31] <Forester_Skippy> that was pretty fst not bad
[2:21:33] <%Das_Bass> Vault of Glass is such a sick raid
[2:21:34] <Captain_Joe1911> heart2Clap heart2Saebom
[2:21:35] <BunnyEmperor> Yeah but Pat, Thunder God requires the entire Raid to know the mechanics LULW
[2:21:36] <%Estuko> monkaS
[2:21:40] <Valdorick> Mechanics? In my Pugs? Its more likely than you think.
[2:21:44] <tigerfang86> jeez agrias
[2:21:48] <+Grizzytron> it's not crazy talk though
[2:21:48] <transporterthesequel> Oh it get's worse
[2:21:49] <%apostateCourier> oh no
[2:21:52] <%vaporousTippler> Agrias has no feet. Did she guest star in Fire Emblem?
[2:21:52] <Ner234> She's scary monkaS
[2:21:53] <mysticember91> How do you unlock this dungeon?
[2:21:53] <%arcaderabbit48> @mudai Currently the only time locked events have been bonus things that give you some cute outfits and extra pets. Even the Monster Hunter boss fight is still available right now
[2:21:54] <+KoyaMusa> pat, don't jinx yourself with thundergod
[2:21:56] <%apostateCourier> he's crazy talking it
[2:21:59] <xeros720> sweet, might actually see this whole thing
[2:22:00] <%apostateCourier> for C I D
[2:22:00] <%SlowLikeThunder> Don't talk until Cid or you'll curse it
[2:22:02] <+Grizzytron> groups still wipe in this place with some regularity
[2:22:04] <kindashagg> It'd be cool if Simone or something like her were in the NieR content. Her mechanics fit this game.
[2:22:04] <xeros720> ahahaha
[2:22:45] <Calern> imagine if the raid is where we're really gonna learn about accord
[2:22:55] <SomersaultJustice> LUL
[2:22:57] <BunnyEmperor> Too close Knights LUL
[2:23:01] <Angry_Ev1L> Kappa

[2:27:53] <tigerfang86> post dots in chat
[2:27:54] <Valsera> gubal was the best for 59-61
[2:28:01] <%dekkitout> Who doesn't like Dippin' D.o.T.'s
[2:28:01] <%radda343> remember that time the game made people learn what a prime number is

[2:28:09] <jemerald0> @louiswho after playing for months, it all becomes second nature

[2:31:10] <Jdrockefeller> stupid thumbs pressing period
[2:31:10] <Valdorick> wait, so, is that a tail with a mouth holding a sword, or a tail with little hands holding a sword?
[2:31:13] <Birdigalore> This guy never stfu?!
[2:31:13] <el_phthalo> Man, that war between the Hokuten and the Nanten really fucked up Orlandeau.
[2:31:23] <BunnyEmperor> This might be good
[2:31:27] <SilverFaustX> yea pat just rambles on
[2:31:32] <xeros720> THAT'S THE TOUGHEST ONE?
[2:31:49] <xeros720> god, 3 people sitting one spot
[2:31:58] <%Estuko> Whoever said just use Ad blocker, that dumb joke is still making me giggle
[2:32:05] <%SlowLikeThunder> Honestly I count any crush weapon that doesn't wipe a whole alliance as a success
[2:32:18] <Valdorick> Black Mage is an incurable sickness, it's only, final symptom are the words "But guys, I just put down my leyline"
[2:32:34] <%Typhaeon> The foreboding soundtrack in this phase is fantastic
[2:32:36] <%DedlokPM> @xeros720 you underestimate how uncoordinated randos can be
[2:32:37] <PrinceOfEden> I got this game for free but I still haven't played it, because I know once I do I'll have to commit to it.
[2:32:37] <BunnyEmperor> Rip Ley Lines
[2:32:46] <el_phthalo> Man, there's so much here that just reminds me why I don't play MMORPGs.
[2:32:46] <%arcaderabbit48> @xeros720 3 people sitting in a specific spot, spread throught the map so everyone in the raid needs to be standing in a specific spot. If even one marker doesnt have 3, then everyone takes huge damage. This is very difficult for people to do, for some reason
[2:32:47] <Aydarkzero> tripleWK tripleSW
[2:32:49] <xeros720> one of my favorite bits of doing the msq was watching how the stack grew in size and intensity
[2:32:55] <Kain5707> @AngriestPat BUT Pat at level 70 everyone should know how these mechanics work, why would we need to learn them now? limesLost
[2:32:56] <%Estuko> @PrinceOfEden the free trial?
[2:33:00] <SomersaultJustice> RAIJINTO
[2:33:00] <@SSaryn> I kinda hope in the future, they'll just do one big fat fucking 24-man alliance raid that's an EX. Just one.

[2:33:34] <%arcaderabbit48> @Qsmash_ Nope
[2:33:35] <Valsera> I farmed the crap out of this for the tank set
[2:33:44] <Jdrockefeller> this is the gate keeper
[2:33:50] <Saltmeisterr> is this shadowbringers content?
[2:33:50] <xeros720> is this even the final boss of the ivalice raids?
[2:33:53] <Thalchampz> probably alter below 50%
[2:33:55] <Valsera> this is stormblood
[2:33:56] <umbrus89> yes
[2:33:59] <%QuadraticGravity> @xeros720 Nope

[2:38:51] <%BlueMoonBlues> They thought it was a wipe probably

[2:40:08] <%arcaderabbit48> @louiswho Release means you left the boss fight and respawned at the entrance
[2:40:08] <damienlunas> 'cause he SHOULD BE
[2:40:12] <Kain5707> good old pug alliance
[2:40:14] <+Rose_Silver> @AngriestPat if you ever wanna avoid level 70 alliance in roulettes, take your gear of before queueing and you will only get 50 or 60 raids
[2:40:17] <+AXL808> release?
[2:40:20] <%sshen> You guys honestly had that if B weren't smoothbrains

[2:40:43] <CriticKitten> O_O
[2:40:44] <mr_slaide> Actually, Only B was mostly dead. C was over half alive, and nobody in A died.
[2:40:46] <transporterthesequel> Because B released
[2:40:46] <Kain5707> they were at the gate
[2:40:47] <%QuadraticGravity> B released, remember
[2:40:47] <%Ilpala> cuz they were waiting outside the boss!
[2:40:47] <fugnuggets01> B pulled
[2:40:48] <fid0n> god I'm so confused
[2:40:48] <+KoyaMusa> you were dead for a while
[2:40:48] <%SlowLikeThunder> because they released early and walked to the entrance

[2:40:49] <%Verd_254> b released remember
[2:40:49] <%zamzoph> Did I see bare thighs on that Samurai outfit?
[2:40:51] <Surprise_Anole> B came back and pulled, amazing
[2:40:53] <BunnyEmperor> They early pulled and you were teleported @AngriestPat
[2:40:53] <Zebroneath> B probaby was waiting right at the entrancce
[2:40:54] <%DedlokPM> B was released for a while
[2:40:54] <Darkencide> LUL
[2:40:54] <KatabolicRage> B was sat at the door because they respawned
[2:40:55] <+Grizzytron> B instantly pulled lmao

[2:41:12] <AfroKing24> good job b
[2:41:12] <%Typhaeon> How do I unsubscribe someone
[2:41:12] <Jdrockefeller> mid fight
[2:41:13] <BunnyEmperor> What a dumbass party lmfao
[2:41:15] <Darkencide> who needs a countdown Kappa
[2:41:15] <KatabolicRage> Every 24man raid has one group that is "special", today that group is B
[2:41:15] <SomersaultJustice> Ending B: Vote A[b]andon
[2:41:16] <%dekkitout> Man, this boss is spittin' some Old Testament tier lines
[2:41:17] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Welcome to pug groups
[2:41:19] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Why is B?
[2:41:20] <+Tarage> KillerB
[2:41:20] <RamenRiderZ> B FOR BEST DendiFace
[2:41:21] <+AXL808> B Team RULZ!
[2:41:22] <Kain5707> Crazy Talk ruined the raid
[2:41:24] <+DynamiteLPs> seems b are just a bunch of noobs
[2:41:25] <CriticKitten> Amazing, B is truly peak skill
[2:41:27] <mr_slaide> Welcome to MMO's.
[2:41:28] <Thalchampz> dude why is alliance raids always this bad LUL
[2:41:28] <El_Tacobandito> I cant wait for wow classic 40 man raids
[2:41:29] <%sshen> I LOVE Alliance raids
[2:41:30] <xeros720> i'm getting stressed out and i'm just watching
[2:41:39] <BunnyEmperor> Early pulling in 24 man raid when the other parties are not there LUL
[2:41:40] <@SSaryn> It's Tanks specifically in some alliances. Who just fucking like to jump right back in once the gates gone.
[2:41:41] <%zamzoph> toxic pat
[2:41:41] <+louiswho> yeah
[2:41:42] <damienlunas> @Thalchampz Because he plays on Primal lul
[2:41:48] <Thalchampz> doing the alliances and the concent itself is cool but GOD
[2:41:54] <%arcaderabbit48> Pat also seems to have super bad luck. I do not normally run in to this much garbage in a single day
[2:41:54] <%DavidSanChan> I loved WoW, but don't miss moments like this
[2:41:56] <+UberWolfman> I love I never get these raid alliances LUL
[2:41:58] <mr_slaide> 1 is full of mouth breathers.
[2:41:59] <Kain5707> if you have a large FC its much better
[2:41:59] <PrinceOfEden> You know for a Thunder God, I'm not seeing a lot of Thunder and Lightning.
[2:42:03] <KatabolicRage> Thunder God Cid is a fight that basically one or two people can screw it up for the entire raid
[2:42:04] <Thalchampz> @damienlunas i also play on primal, is it better on Aether or wherever else?
[2:42:06] <%sshen> There is SO MUCH petty bullshit in ARs that you never see elsehwere and it's so GOOD
[2:42:10] <KatabolicRage> wiping city had a fight like this
[2:42:12] <BunnyEmperor> Another failed Duskblade
[2:42:14] <@SSaryn> Especially during fights like this and Ozma
[2:42:16] <+louiswho> morale is low
[2:42:20] <%tyler274> DEATH AND DEATH ALONE. nice
[2:42:20] <BluBox> Duskblade failed
[2:42:22] <BluBox> Somehow
[2:42:31] <Cowctus> Did one of C's fucking healers release
[2:42:36] <ovan20> now is everything falling apart rooBooli
[2:42:40] <BunnyEmperor> You will have to help with C add
[2:42:40] <damienlunas> The stereotype is that Aether is better because it had more DCs that were geared towards raiding but really it's impossible to escape morons
[2:42:42] <%tyler274> ozma with perma death is even BETTER. (Eureka)
[2:42:42] <RamenRiderZ> Crystal Tower raids are idiot-proof so easy roulette
[2:42:43] <Kain5707> this will be tough for C
[2:42:47] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Yeah, this raid is pretty much the only place where I've encountered legit jerkasses
[2:42:55] <MrNoobMcSalt> Looks like
[2:42:55] <BluBox> I think they did
[2:42:57] <mr_slaide> Yep, they ddid.
[2:42:59] <%Gogogolem> I believe in you creepy porpose
[2:43:01] <ozuma35> released?
[2:43:03] <@SSaryn> Ozma specifically with Meteors was a problem.
[2:43:03] <+Tarage> WHY would you release?
[2:43:05] <transporterthesequel> This is fantastic
[2:43:09] <CriticKitten> WOW
[2:43:09] <+RyloStar> it's sad seeing how bad people are at this game
[2:43:10] <BunnyEmperor> What the actual fuck
[2:43:10] <mr_slaide> Because they're idiots.
[2:43:10] <Zebroneath> Like, once one cog of the raid machine fails to provide, it slowly starts coming apart.
[2:43:10] <conflict1914> what does "released" mean, i've never gotten to this level of the game
[2:43:13] <%Ilpala> omg c's add's health bar
[2:43:17] <%StripesUltimateEdition> A D J U S T
[2:43:18] <MarylandJutsu> WE FALLLLLLLL WE FALLLLL
[2:43:20] <BluBox> This is the true Orbonne experience
[2:43:22] <%GarbageNirvana> That's the point at which you start kicking motherfuckers
[2:43:22] <saulic1234> dps and healer
[2:43:22] <+KoyaMusa> its called return but okay
[2:43:22] <+Tarage> Yeah WHY release that quickly
[2:43:22] <ozuma35> ohh cheers pat
[2:43:25] <%DedlokPM> 1 healer and 2 1 dps released
[2:43:26] <fugnuggets01> Sit outside like a loser
[2:43:27] <%XzileGaming> releasing is Tapping out
[2:43:29] <conflict1914> woooow, that's shitty
[2:43:33] <%salty_syd913> wow
[2:43:37] <SomersaultJustice> don't worry, just play perfectly
[2:43:37] <Cowctus> I would fucking Abandon at this point, I don't have the patience for that
[2:43:38] <Valdorick> The best thing WoW ever did was prevent releasing during boss encounters.
[2:43:38] <Birdigalore> So is this the FF14 equivalent of WoW LFR? lol
[2:43:38] <artificiallynatural> do they still get the rewards?
[2:43:39] <+Rose_Silver> @AngriestPat if you ever wanna avoid level 70 alliance in roulettes, take your gear of before queueing and you will only get 50 or 60 raid
[2:43:44] <%Shonen_hero> man fuck that
[2:43:46] <+RowenCleric> How hard is it to tank these big alliance raid
[2:43:51] <BunnyEmperor> wipe
[2:43:54] <Kain5707> this is what happens when you raid on Sunday
[2:43:58] <%king_wragles> Wait, what did I miss?
[2:43:59] <+Grizzytron> @Birdigalore pretty much
[2:44:03] <%king_wragles> Who screwed the healer?
[2:44:03] <transporterthesequel> Pretty easy, actually, to tank them
[2:44:07] <%arcaderabbit48> @RowenCleric Tanking is usually pretty easy because the mechanics involve everyone anyway
[2:44:08] <BunnyEmperor> holy shit thats close
[2:44:09] <mr_slaide> Tanking difficulty depends on the fight.
[2:44:14] <@SSaryn> Yeah, solo healing this and keeping track of Vulnerability on tanks and DPS? Shits rough.
[2:44:16] <%Estuko> LUL
[2:44:17] <RamenRiderZ> B pussied out mid fight
[2:44:17] <CriticKitten> LUL
[2:44:17] <%sshen> YEAH
[2:44:18] <KatabolicRage> in all seriousness you should only ever release if the entire raid is outside of combat
[2:44:19] <mr_slaide> LOL
[2:44:20] <+Ryan1016> LUL
[2:44:21] <Ner234> What about Sundays makes this more common?
[2:44:21] <+RyloStar> should get banned for these shitty selfish attitudes lol

[2:44:37] <%cirdrag> cue britney

[2:44:40] <xeros720> kind of glad pat is censoring the chat for us
[2:44:40] <gustavozxd> toxicity is my fav part about online games
[2:44:40] <%StripesUltimateEdition> apatBig toxic
[2:44:41] <%arcaderabbit48> Hoes Mad x24
[2:44:42] <+KoyaMusa> 96 swordplay gauge, you would have nearly wiped there
[2:44:43] <%NWR_James> heated gamer moments
[2:44:46] <%Zamorouskiwhich> I still haven't beaten this raid...
[2:44:54] <%QuadraticGravity> I hope group C kicks that guy
[2:44:55] <%vaporousTippler> All of this proves the Ascians were right about us.
[2:44:58] <Ser_Randal> Take ya lumps
[2:44:58] <+CaptainJax> Pat getting banned for toxicity live on stream
[2:44:58] <Surprise_Anole> Alliance raids are the only part of this game I've seen real salt in
[2:45:00] <%Jaxnos> taste that pain
[2:45:00] <MarylandJutsu> MAXIMUM TOXIC
[2:45:01] <$valriot> Can't even disagree with them, healing is...a thing in this game
[2:45:02] <tysmiller> not doing jobs. its almost like this game is being played by....people
[2:45:04] <tigerfang86> do ur best
[2:45:04] <CriticKitten> Yeah, literally just do your job and save the salt for later
[2:45:07] <BunnyEmperor> Yeah they should kick that healer
[2:45:08] <%SlowLikeThunder> I feel like even alliance raids that are the easiest shit in the world are always like a knife's edge away from a radioactive waste dump
[2:45:11] <%XzileGaming> CalmestPat
[2:45:19] <Kain5707> kick them after the fight
[2:45:21] <transporterthesequel> Even if some suck, all of them don't, and they don't deserve it
[2:45:23] <Zebroneath> t101Big t101Oof
[2:45:26] <@SSaryn> Ya wanna know the best way to deal with healers or immediately release? Kick them before the last boss.
[2:45:27] <Finaldragoon> @AngriestPat my personal mantra for any online co-op game "Quitters never win, winners never quit"
[2:45:28] <xeros720> oh cog
[2:45:29] <%sshen> This and Construct 7 are the ones that have big toxic arguments
[2:45:30] <KatabolicRage> all throwing your toys out of the pram is gonna do is make the entire thing take even longer and potentially cause another wipe

[2:45:34] <%korth367> why did you stay there tho
[2:45:34] <SomersaultJustice> stabby stab stab
[2:45:34] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> @AngriestPat this is why you take all of your gear off so your ilvl is 100 before you queue for alliance raids
[2:45:34] <%arcaderabbit48> Healing isnt even that hard in this game
[2:45:36] <%velemi> that was your fault for not moving out
[2:45:42] <+Grizzytron> two dozen random people thrown together in a group, what could possibly go wrong? Kappa
[2:45:42] <RamenRiderZ> MuH lEyLiNeS
[2:45:43] <%Owkono> redrum
[2:45:44] <+DynamiteLPs> yeah for some reason the alliance raids seem to have a high concentration of shitty attitutudes
[2:45:46] <mrjohncarlton> Quick Pat release Kappa
[2:46:00] <KatabolicRage> thats because people kept "accidentally" releasing to get out of having to do the fight
[2:46:03] <MarylandJutsu> @arcaderabbit48 it is when the DPS acts like idiots
[2:46:06] <Valdorick> Cog got it bad, it might be terminal.
[2:46:07] <%arcaderabbit48> You must choose to be a shitty person
[2:46:07] <KaliasTV> My cat sat on the release button

[2:48:00] <jemerald0> Welcome to Orbonne Monastery
[2:48:01] <+Rose_Silver> @AngriestPat if you ever wanna avoid level 70 alliance in roulettes, take your gear of before queueing and you will only get 50 or 60 raid
[2:48:02] <BlueEagle2395> THE GODS WILL NOT BE WATCHING
[2:48:03] <Aydarkzero> So is that a wipe
[2:48:04] <TheNamelessGun> When the boss's taunts are on point. :) :)

[2:48:05] <transporterthesequel> This is the best 2019
[2:48:05] <BunnyEmperor> No vote abandon though LULW
[2:48:05] <tysmiller> alliance raids really aren't fun, and this is why. one person can wreck it all
[2:48:08] <%XzileGaming> this is the inherent problem with MMOs
[2:48:10] <+2DSuperiority> just came back...oh no
[2:48:10] <Kain5707> @AngriestPat you know if they start the fight right away they cant vote kick

[2:48:45] <+Grizzytron> ready to be carried
[2:48:48] <Thalchampz> this is why i get worried about healing alliances, i'm scared of fucking up
[2:48:49] <@CreepyPorpoise> ah thank you @XzileGaming
[2:48:49] <Valdorick> @AXL808 My fucking soul, you hurt it... oh god
[2:48:49] <xeros720> big ready
[2:48:50] <@SSaryn> whaddya mean, what's a ready check
[2:48:51] <T3merity> If there’s anything I’ve learned from this, it’s that those blue quests are the devil. Alliance raids are a breeze for me, I only have crystal tower unlocked lol
[2:48:51] <raimsurion> How many wipes? I just started watching.
[2:48:52] <%Remery_> cute anime names :)
[2:48:52] <+tunnelvisionary> release nier raid is gonna be a salt mine I can feel it
[2:48:58] <%sshen> I'm screaming at alliance C for you Porp
[2:49:02] <mrjohncarlton> Interaction with other humans was a mistake
[2:49:05] <HyperBomb21> This is why I dont like MMOs
[2:49:15] <fimbulvetr27> Now imagine the Baldesion Arsenal in Eureka. Where one person ruins it for 55 others, and costs them 4+ hours of setup and you only get to the second boss...
[2:49:17] <%sshen> They could have got the doom off, the WHM needed to PoM/Thin Air and then cure 3 to glory
[2:49:21] <%sshen> Instead they did medica
[2:49:22] <Videogamer4> god I cant imagine playing this game I'd get so salty
[2:49:26] <%Halowood> @raimsurion 2, first wipe a whole party released while healers were raising
[2:49:26] <BunnyEmperor> It is a 24 man raid after all.. gotta work together
[2:49:27] <%Gohyakuen> It MUST needs
[2:49:30] <$Big_King_Coconut> this is an optional raid
[2:49:33] <@SSaryn> And it's pretty easy for most WHM, Medica 2 and Cure 3 till your ass is all better.
[2:49:34] <%JLWStreams> I cant tell, but is there the 'You tried' buff in 24 mans?
[2:49:36] <%sshen> also asylum
[2:49:41] <@SSaryn> But with only 1 healer, ehhhhhhh
[2:49:41] <%President_Miyazaki> Yeah, see, none of this looks or sounds fun to me.
[2:49:42] <+DynamiteLPs> for now
[2:49:43] <%dekkitout> Doom can only be cleansed with antioxidants
[2:49:44] <%SlashHabit> too toxic
[2:49:47] <Renuarb> I dont think its the doom thing. Team C probably doesnt know how to pull the tether OFF the tank, so the rest of the party melts to autos
[2:49:51] <%StripesUltimateEdition> the toxic god
[2:49:51] <MaeMae94> It honestly astonishes me how these kinds of people can get THIS FAR into the game
[2:49:52] <%sshen> SSaryn, that whm could have done it
[2:49:55] <TurtlesAndTentacles> the boss talks alot
[2:50:00] <%ThatRandomGuy661> Pat would have better luck putting together 24 people for a private alliance run
[2:50:08] <@SSaryn> Nah, with only one healer, this Doom check is rough.
[2:50:10] <$valriot> Put it in the back Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm

[2:57:12] <$Thatghostpepper> @AngriestPat let me hop on and help you out
[2:57:12] <%EmiinV> TIME TO JOIN IN PROG
[2:57:13] <+KoyaMusa> man just vote abandon
[2:57:20] <+Raidou24> Glad to see scrubs doing what they do best in Thunder God
[2:57:23] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> *return
[2:57:24] <damienlunas> You've reached the point where people start getting tired and making mistakes
[2:57:24] <+Rose_Silver> @AngriestPat if you ever wanna avoid level 70 alliance in roulettes, take your gear of before queueing and you will only get 50 or 60 raid
[2:57:24] <+Ryan1016> Now it's EASIER
[2:57:25] <%Ascethetic> @angriestpat to let it set in, youve been in there AN HOUR
[2:57:25] <Basch71> loooooooool
[2:57:26] <@SSaryn> Welp. This might be it.
[2:57:26] <Kain5707> this is worse than the release
[2:57:27] <%sshen> The smoothbrains came back
[2:57:27] <+TheSaintJohn> what changed?
[2:57:29] <SomersaultJustice> YES
[2:57:31] <+UberWolfman> Ehhhhh
[2:57:34] <@CreepyPorpoise> :C
[2:57:34] <KatabolicRage> all the people good at it have no reason to do it anymore
[2:57:41] <Ser_Randal> Never surrender never give up
[2:57:44] <+Ryan1016> @TheSaintJohn It's easier now with better gear
[2:57:45] <BluBox> Wasn't easy for most people but this is nuts
[2:57:45] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> I guess not everyone knows the alliance raid queue trick
[2:57:48] <Basch71> and gear level is now higher than before LuL
[2:57:50] <%sshen> LEVEL BOOSTS
[2:57:51] <Finakala> The second day it came out I had the worst experience I've had with orbonne
[2:57:51] <Valdorick> Yeah but, Sunday night Idiot Squad.
[2:57:53] <Renuarb> @AngriestPat Its because all the skilled players had a reason to farm Orbonne. Now that its outdated, only casual babies run it now
[2:57:54] <Birdigalore> No it's fuckers buying JUMP POTS
[2:57:56] <%sourceofall> this is why I basically leave right away if i get this one in roulette
[2:57:57] <+TheSaintJohn> level skip strikes again
[2:58:03] <Kain5707> its also Sunday
[2:58:05] <$Mothman742> did he already do the d2 grindin? or has he just been doin this?
[2:58:05] <+barold403> This was awful with pug groups when it released
[2:58:09] <Verboseobserver> yeah but now casuals are doing it and the pros have moved on
[2:58:14] <+Rose_Silver> @AngriestPat if you ever wanna avoid level 70 alliance in roulettes, take your gear of before queueing and you will only get 50 or 60 raid
[2:58:18] <+LiberatedPhoenix> Like me
[2:58:22] <Daniel_Is_I> Not even level skip. Sometimes they're just THAT stupid and somehow leveled 1-80 without learning
[2:58:24] <Cactuskris> even if they still had to level to 80
[2:58:26] <@SSaryn> And since this IS Level 70, it's right there. They're fully maxed out on Lv70 gear too.
[2:58:27] <Ner234> Someone explain. What about Sundays makes this more common?
[2:58:29] <%thegreatestbambe> it really be like that
[2:58:30] <+apocplz> i haven't played an MMO since Vanilla WoW but this rant still sounds extremely familiar barbLUL
[2:58:31] <Basch71> those people are bitches
[2:58:36] <+KoyaMusa> feels good playing on a jp server where this doesn't happen
[2:58:36] <%velemi> Which results in more people not knowing how it works
[2:58:37] <%EmiinV> tryin to join that in prog to give 'em a competent healer
[2:58:37] <%sshen> People will tank their ilvls just so they can run CT/WoD
[2:58:39] <KeiPrime> more people have time to play on sunday
[2:58:40] <$shurtal> Is that Cool Lightning with a Cool Samurai Sword?
[2:58:40] <%Goobbue> I skipped this and guess I don't intend on doing it now
[2:58:43] <Renuarb> When the Nier Raid drops, Alliance Roulette will be saved again
[2:58:43] <$vG_Chance> i was gonna say how do u get to level 70 without learning, but then u said level boost and now it all makes sense
[2:58:45] <MrNoobMcSalt> all of this has made me pick up my 80 SCH again. love this feeling
[2:58:50] <+RyloStar> if you drop your ilvl down to 70 when you queue for alliance roulette you only get labrynth or syrcus @AngriestPat
[2:58:50] <raimsurion> Now any healers who see a "In progress Orbonne" and NOPE out
[2:58:53] <MasterDecoder> Level skips SHOULD NOT EXIST, especially if the game REQUIRES learning
[2:58:54] <lunarwolf88> why not put a simple explanation about that mechanic in the text?
[2:58:55] <%zamzoph> @AngriestPat Is there ANY value to play ARR before the rework? I kinda wanna see all that's there before it's gone for good
[2:58:57] <%thegreatestbambe> oh no
[2:58:57] <Aydarkzero> Ye'h if i got this game i would learn it
[2:58:59] <RamenRiderZ> Most people also cheese the alliance roulette to get Crystal Tower raid right?
[2:59:00] <%starotter70> Oh man
[2:59:01] <%thegreatestbambe> its. that bad?
[2:59:01] <KatabolicRage> monday is also good cos the last minuters are doing it
[2:59:02] <monopolyman001> and its a weekend.
[2:59:03] <Ner234> Oh
[2:59:07] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat so do people who dont know shit about the game they can just buy the best gear ever?
[2:59:10] <eanscrale> Fun
[2:59:12] <+edited156> So what's stopping you guys from pulling right now? I literally don't understand FF14.
[2:59:12] <+Ryan1016> @AngriestPat This is the same for destiny 2 in general, way better players on Tuesday. Most mmos are like that
[2:59:12] <VoidTracks> Also people with jobs which are probably more casual are playing on their weekend off
[2:59:13] <+Grizzytron> ARR rework isn't coming for a long ass while, buddy
[2:59:20] <@SSaryn> @RamenRiderZ Shoutouts to Strident who does this stuff when we do Roulettes and do Alliance.
[2:59:23] <supuhmagikarp> They need a healer? I want in this garbage
[2:59:25] <+Unlimited_Rulebook> @angriestpat reduce your ilvl to 100 before queueing for alliance raid
[2:59:25] <+Xanezz> or just people who just randomly decided today is the day they try it the first time
[2:59:26] <Videogamer4> if that happened to monster hunter if actually get frustrated playing the game if they allowed people to skip hr
[2:59:32] <+Xanezz> and dont know what theyre doing
[2:59:34] <monopolyman001> they are waiting for another player so they arent pulling
[2:59:37] <mayorrev> look at that fortnite dance
[2:59:41] <%EmiinV> in prog isn't proc'ing rangel2Life
[2:59:44] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:45] <%sourceofall> what is that dance that guys is doing
[2:59:45] <%Gray_skies1993> @AngriestPat watching you stream this is making me want to get in, I tend to like bang shooty wizard types is Black Mage good rn?
[2:59:50] <Heartless_01> why are some people so tiny? LUL
[2:59:50] <SomersaultJustice> do /mmambo
[2:59:55] <+UberWolfman> @zamzoph Its coming next year, but its only removing the filler in the post ARR he talked about being 100 quests down to probably half of that if possible
[2:59:58] <KatabolicRage> I don't queu for alliance raids with in progress joining enabled, cos it means I'm joining groups with problems
[2:59:58] <monopolyman001> black mage is mucho damage
[3:00:01] <@DariusFTL> @edited156 Nothing really, but there's a party that's down a healer, and that healer couldn't handle healing by themselves earlier, so it'd probably end in tragedy.
[3:00:06] <haveswordmuststing> man, level boost
[3:00:06] <+Ziekwalt> What data center is Pat on?
[3:00:07] <+Grizzytron> omg you can't just ask someone why they're small
[3:00:07] <xeros720> hmm, the problem with monster hunter is that players can get carried through required hunts
[3:00:08] <+Ryan1016> HOW
[3:00:12] <haveswordmuststing> its the worst
[3:00:15] <Basch71> BLM is amazing
[3:00:15] <%StripesUltimateEdition> WHM GANG UNITE
[3:00:16] <IveGotALaserFace> @AngriestPat how often do you have apply the tried and true method of kicking trash?
[3:00:17] <@SSaryn> Mages and Ranged DPS are straight up amazing right now.
[3:00:20] <gustavozxd> blue mage is the best class for SURE
[3:00:22] <%Gogogolem> This is hilarious
[3:00:24] <Filthy_Acts> SMN is not weak, it just destroys your fingers.
[3:00:24] <%Gray_skies1993> @AngriestPat awesome, ty! apatDab
[3:00:25] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> RDM is great and simple to learn
[3:00:27] <%Ascethetic> summoner is for starcraft players
[3:00:27] <%sshen> I'll try to log in and join in progress to be Cs healer
[3:00:29] <+Raidou24> @AngriestPat Wiping City of Mhach is still pretty bad
[3:00:29] <supuhmagikarp> Sum is not weak, They do have a alot a buttons
[3:00:31] <+AXL808> They put Paige in a full body cast of used McDonald's wrappers
[3:00:31] <Heartless_01> lol
[3:00:31] <%zamzoph> Pat was totally saying that it was representative earlier
[3:00:31] <%Estuko> LUL
[3:00:33] <Thalchampz> i love RDM
[3:00:36] <%Zamorouskiwhich> One healer in C ruuS
[3:00:38] <xeros720> i kind of wish they'd force some solo content, ff14 does, but people with skip potions can skip
[3:00:39] <monopolyman001> 23 man raid SourPls
[3:00:39] <%Remery_> The toxic lure ppl in
[3:00:39] <%Ilpala> doom gonna be fun with ONE HEALER
[3:00:40] <%Nobrev> NotLikeThis
[3:00:41] <$OmegaWeltall> OH this IS represenetive of the game experience people are BAD at thsi game LUL
[3:00:42] <%croxeye> croxeye converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[3:00:43] <+DynamiteLPs> i'm only getting back into this and im really learning my role and only my sole role as Tank because if i cant do my role right then what's the point
[3:00:44] <%HeySeuss> Man, this really puts into perspective why using that level skip in destiny and skipping shit was a bad idea
[3:00:48] <TheHotStuven> Yikes
[3:00:49] <%thegreatestbambe> Hes doing it
[3:00:50] <MaeMae94> Spoiler alert, it won't be
[3:00:51] <ittla> what's worse, dealing with this or doing crystal tower for the 100th time?
[3:00:51] <XyraFhoan> whm can do it pretty easy solo with cure III
[3:00:52] <Foggysheep> MUST NEEDS
[3:00:53] <%Ilpala> BIG HEALS
[3:00:55] <SomersaultJustice> GASP
[3:00:55] <%EmiinV> it's a white mage, it's 100% possible
[3:00:55] <%Gray_skies1993> @HeySeuss agreed
[3:00:55] <Basch71> solo healer LuL
[3:00:56] <%QuadraticGravity> It's a white mage, they're fine
[3:00:56] <artoflec> I wish I understood this game enough to understand why this situation sucks lol
[3:00:57] <%EmiinV> cure 3 spam
[3:00:57] <Zebroneath> They have a chance
[3:01:00] <@SSaryn> Thanks to big Cure 3's and a RDM, it IS possible.
[3:01:02] <RamenRiderZ> I'm really considering maining BRD/MCH this time around, so fun
[3:01:02] <xeros720> that fuckin guy did it
[3:01:02] <Ner234> I love how the boss just patiently waited there LUL
[3:01:03] <SomersaultJustice> ayyyyy
[3:01:06] <%zamzoph> carry C Healer
[3:01:08] <@SSaryn> And a Monk too
[3:01:09] <fugnuggets01> pray for C healer
[3:01:09] <%Halowood> It's a WHM so ez
[3:01:09] <xeros720> i'm sure he burned some cooldowns though
[3:01:13] <KeiPrime> now that i think about it, i havent seen orboner roulette in a while
[3:01:14] <%Scorpion12590> C the true hero
[3:01:15] <BluBox> I feel bad for that C healer
[3:01:17] <%Zamorouskiwhich> I mean, it wasn't C who messed up last time ruuSmug
[3:01:17] <%Verd_254> I find it fun to see a dungeon actually be difficult compared to going through the MSQ with no roadblocks.
[3:01:18] <Darkencide> C solo heal PogChamp
[3:01:19] <KeiPrime> i get rabanasty more often
[3:01:21] <SomersaultJustice> C healer pls do everything thx
[3:01:23] <fid0n> Can't you quit and roll a different group?
[3:01:29] <%sshen> time to try to search for in progress and help C
[3:01:43] <%frankthetank285> clearly
[3:01:44] <Basch71> Cid's such a beast
[3:01:45] <+Grizzytron> shhh, we deep in the sunk cost fallacy rn
[3:01:46] <gustavozxd> not racist but
[3:01:47] <%joylent_blue> its a love/hate relationship?
[3:01:48] <MasterDecoder> @HeySeuss Definitely, as I said a min or two ago, level skips should not exist, especially in game that requires mechanics and learning
[3:01:49] <keiji_maede> Dose Pat raid, Guys?
[3:01:52] <mr_slaide> Welcome to mmo's.
[3:01:53] <%EmiinV> why isn't in progress working rangel2Life
[3:01:53] <+AXL808> Respect your support, people
[3:01:53] <TheHotStuven> Sometimes you're forced to play with random people
[3:01:57] <supuhmagikarp> what world is pat in?
[3:01:57] <Birdigalore> This is the true MMO experience bitch!
[3:01:57] <MaeMae94> It's become my favourite game, but sometimes....
[3:01:58] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> People gonna people sadly. It's the curse of multiplayer.
[3:02:01] <+UberWolfman> its almost as if people suck on a Macro level Kappa
[3:02:05] <SomersaultJustice> "I love this game, but only when I win"
[3:02:08] <blackorchidKI2> The game doesn't love you.
[3:02:08] <%dekkitout> "Don't hate the player, hate the game" has never been more WRONG
[3:02:10] <lunarwolf88> I don't understand why everyone is so angry. FF14 used to be pretty chill.
[3:02:10] <KaliasTV> I've never played this game, can I jump potion directly into this raid Kappa
[3:02:10] <mr_slaide> Healer's job = Compensate for dumb dps.
[3:02:12] <mayorrev> da swoooord
[3:02:12] <%HeySeuss> They should exist but for people who know how the thing works
[3:02:14] <%starotter70> I've heard being a healer in this game is suffering
[3:02:14] <tigerfang86> Cid's life style determines his death style
[3:02:16] <%skizzuto> God I left to grab dinner and we're still on this boss?
[3:02:21] <Ser_Randal> Motherfuckers always trying to ice skate up hills
[3:02:26] <+KoyaMusa> c also can't lb3
[3:02:29] <%HeySeuss> So straight up do not allow new players to level skip
[3:02:29] <OhSleepySheepy> As someone who mains healer, seeing a bad healer hurts me
[3:02:35] <@SSaryn> It's suffering with pugs.
[3:02:36] <gustavozxd> it's not easy
[3:02:36] <+AXL808> more like torture
[3:02:40] <supuhmagikarp> yes it is
[3:02:42] <Basch71> healer's not that bad at all
[3:02:44] <tigerfang86> on the one hand healing bad players sounds terrible
[3:02:49] <Bladeexe> My brother likes being a healer.
[3:02:51] <%EmiinV> letmein.png
[3:02:51] <BunnyEmperor> OH GOD is this still going on?
[3:02:52] <Basch71> but people can be just braindead
[3:02:52] <%dekkitout> Healers in almost any game get it rough
[3:02:52] <tigerfang86> on the other hand being healed by a bad healer is also terrible
[3:02:54] <+Xanezz> healing can be super rewarding or super frustrating
[3:02:55] <lunarwolf88> c has a white mage the doom isn't an issue.
[3:02:57] <%sshen> SSaryn, whens innoc ex
[3:02:58] <xeros720> i like healing a lot, but yeah, idiots dying over and over is just the worst
[3:02:58] <tigerfang86> it's bad all the way down
[3:02:59] <RamenRiderZ> Alliance Raid prog Kappa
[3:03:00] <Birdigalore> Being a healer is becoming aware that everyone around you is stupid BABIES
[3:03:01] <supuhmagikarp> you are the parent holding DPS with children leashs
[3:03:01] <%Ascethetic> i was healer main for 6 years
[3:03:04] <MaeMae94> Tanking is a lot more fun imo
[3:03:06] <ittla> wait this isnt the last???
[3:03:09] <@SSaryn> @sshen When I get a WHM up in ShB.
[3:03:09] <ittla> lmao
[3:03:13] <Darkencide> ultima LUL
[3:03:18] <KeiPrime> p l e a s e
[3:03:24] <$valriot> This is literally why I don't play this game after a month of a patch, the content and playerbase is tuned to like, OmegaGarbage people, and they have to spend resources making easy trash with no replay value
[3:03:26] <%StripesUltimateEdition> HAPPENING
[3:03:29] <%EmiinV> yeah joining in prog isn't filling that spot idk why
[3:03:30] <@SSaryn> Actually no, I do have my WHM up
[3:03:32] <$Big_King_Coconut> pat just do better dps and it'll be done faster
[3:03:33] <%Zamorouskiwhich> apatBig N O
[3:03:34] <@SSaryn> Just didnt bother gearing it.
[3:03:35] <%EmiinV> i keep getting new instances
[3:03:41] <ovan20> Pat is going to have a heart attack with this team LUL
[3:03:44] <Finaldragoon> @AngriestPat I did Twinning the other day on a healer and the Tank popped literally every laser and forced me to heal twice as hard
[3:03:45] <Valdorick> The idea of healing is poison to me. The idea of bars going up instead of down is just awful to my brain.
[3:03:49] <%sshen> Stop replacing me SSaryn quiettCry
[3:03:57] <%StripesUltimateEdition> thats a BM
[3:04:02] <+RyloStar> sunk cost
[3:04:07] <%EDevilShocker> After the first couple weeks I avoided this place like the fucking plague
[3:04:16] <raimsurion> Yeah but you cant mess up the level 50 24 mans
[3:04:18] <KatabolicRage> I farmed this for glams
[3:04:19] <damienlunas> But you could take off your gear and force yourself to get LotA
[3:04:20] <@SSaryn> @sshen I mean, I'd rather play DRK or DNC.
[3:04:21] <Daniel_Is_I> Couldn't you also get a really easy raid like syrcus?
[3:04:27] <Slim_Lipid> shedLToxic shedMToxic shedMToxic
[3:04:28] <raimsurion> ^
[3:04:30] <Filthy_Acts> Last time I did Orbonne, we didn't wipe on Thunder God and everyone was surprised.
[3:04:35] <TurtlesAndTentacles> it is fun
[3:04:36] <%Remery_> like a hero
[3:04:38] <%Verd_254> fun for us
[3:04:38] <Cactuskris> you should play guild wars you could do it all on your own
[3:04:39] <transporterthesequel> No this IS VERY FUN
[3:04:39] <fid0n> It's fun
[3:04:41] <+Qsmash_> its fun for us
[3:04:41] <%walternatorz> watching pat suffer is fun
[3:04:43] <spaxis_> I wish i could get into this game, everything looks really cool
[3:04:43] <Valdorick> Roll the dice, pull the lever.
[3:04:43] <saulic1234> For the DRK weapon?
[3:04:44] <%starotter70> I'm having fun
[3:04:45] <T3merity> fun to watch lol
[3:04:46] <+AXL808> we can enjoy Pats suffering
[3:04:46] <SomersaultJustice> I'm having fun
[3:04:47] <CriticKitten> This is super fun
[3:04:47] <IveGotALaserFace> imagine bad players on the Nier raid, if the raid there has Taro fuckery going on
[3:04:48] <+Ziekwalt> @Angriestpat What data center are you on?
[3:04:48] <%zamzoph> D:
[3:04:48] <PunishedMercer_> lmao pat
[3:04:49] <mayorrev> TOXIC
[3:04:50] <BunnyEmperor> @AngriestPat D: but I am entertained
[3:04:51] <+edited156> Does FF14 have wipe protection? WoW has a stacking buff to damage/health/healing on wips in raid finder, does this have the same?
[3:04:51] <%joylent_blue> ban whoever that was
[3:04:51] <TurtlesAndTentacles> It's fun for us not you. Dance Puppet Dance!
[3:04:51] <@SSaryn> Strem the 5.1 Alliance Raid that'll be fun Kappa
[3:04:51] <mudai> well, I think it's fun
[3:04:52] <%QuadraticGravity> @raimsurion you'd think so, right? Did you know the atomos pads in labyrinth have an enrage?
[3:04:53] <ovan20> LUL
[3:04:53] <$valriot> Playing this game on stream at all, isn't fun. It's boring to watch ill be honest.
[3:04:53] <%thegreatestbambe> apatHat
[3:04:54] <Ner234> WOW PAT
[3:04:55] <%sshen> This raid is why everyone drops their ilvl for crystal tower

[3:05:06] <fugnuggets01> PJSalt Pats
[3:05:06] <BunnyEmperor> I love it when Pat becomes Angriest Pat
[3:05:08] <parkslady> better than me
[3:05:08] <xeros720> and attempt to explain the boss mechanics
[3:05:08] <+Grizzytron> If he stripped down he could've forced labyrinth or syrcus, but those are completely snoozefests both as a player and as a viewer
[3:05:08] <Ner234> OMEGA SALT
[3:05:08] <%DavidSanChan> Pat's natural state of being

[3:05:15] <@SSaryn> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[3:05:16] <KatabolicRage> nothing like spending over an hour in orbonne to remind you of why you hate people
[3:05:16] <Valdorick> You gotta drink water to counter all the slat you're taking in.
[3:05:16] <%Gray_skies1993> yeah this reminds me so much of WoW at times
[3:05:18] <beonka> I love spicy Orbonne.
[3:05:18] <ovan20> salty Pat, my favorite KappaPride

[3:05:25] <+Qsmash_> yep
[3:05:26] <transporterthesequel> having done this, super yes
[3:05:26] <+betrayed_llama> nah
[3:05:27] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Oh then yes
[3:05:27] <%NWR_James> toxic o
[3:05:28] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Absolutely.
[3:05:28] <MasterDecoder> I mean, it helps you live up to your name @AngriestPat
[3:05:28] <CriticKitten> Yes, and it's amazing how bad they are
[3:05:28] <%oddslogic> ehhh
[3:05:29] <damienlunas> @AngriestPat I was actually lying down going to take a nap while watching your stream, and then Orbonne started happening and I have been glued to my screen.
[3:05:29] <+KoyaMusa> the game is, not hard
[3:05:30] <BunnyEmperor> We do the fight in our sleep LUL
[3:05:30] <%miguelrod777> yes
[3:05:31] <%Zamorouskiwhich> I get it al, and I have not even done it before :)
[3:05:32] <Ser_Randal> Yup
[3:05:34] <artoflec> i just got here a few minutes ago so not me unforutnately artofl1Sad
[3:05:38] <%zamzoph> muh mechanics
[3:05:39] <%Shonen_hero> I've done WoW raids, I get the gist of it
[3:05:40] <+edited156> Man I have no idea what I'm seeing Pat
[3:05:41] <%joylent_blue> yeah i get it, dragging an AoE through the group LUL shits hilarious
[3:05:42] <+abuptabe> People failing universal mechanics is the worst
[3:05:43] <+2DSuperiority> that's why you slash slap them
[3:05:45] <mr_slaide> PAt, I've been plaing mmo's since the days of Everquest. Tank and healers always... I know what it is to deal with dumb players.
[3:05:48] <Nineball_Luce> I've done Raid Finder G'huun on WoW. I understand.
[3:05:49] <+Olrok651> #1 rule of Raid DPS: You can't DPS if you are dead
[3:05:51] <+louiswho> maybe raids should have a designated tour guide on mic telling everyone where to go lol
[3:05:54] <Valdorick> This shit is super basic if you have even passing interest in games.
[3:05:54] <$Billyuppercut0> I just got here so unfortunately no
[3:05:54] <ittla> I think it's fun when old content is made tough by noobs but you can only put up with so many wipes ffs. it's not hard to learn
[3:05:56] <%Verd_254> That's the problem with something being dictated solely on knowing the tell or ability.
[3:05:57] <Thalchampz> @AngriestPat i'm really bad at mechanics but by this point i'd probably have all of this figured out
[3:05:59] <Cowctus> I've gotten back into the game like a month ago after a very long break, when I didn't even get to Heavensward. And I found this boss' mechanics way simpler than the final boss'
[3:06:02] <%dekkitout> You think this is bad, try tutoring someone who immediately forgets what you've taught
[3:06:02] <%StripesUltimateEdition> C aint lookin too ho- oh nevermind
[3:06:03] <transporterthesequel> he did it!
[3:06:03] <lunarwolf88> No I don't get the anger. I am seeing anyone do this stuff on purpose to troll the raid they are just making mistakes,
[3:06:05] <damienlunas> This is the run, Pat. You've got this. You've SO got this.
[3:06:06] <+edited156> @QuadraticGravity Thank you for the answer.
[3:06:07] <Basch71> oh man
[3:06:09] <soullesskin> Hey pat have you ever played borderlands 2 handsome collection? what were your thoughts?
[3:06:09] <transporterthesequel> GJ C!
[3:06:09] <badzombie28> Yes
[3:06:10] <@SSaryn> Which they did thanks to MNK most likely.
[3:06:10] <Nazgul240> hearing all these "go fuck yourselves" makes me want to see Pat on the Dick Show
[3:06:10] <Cowctus> The fact that people are failing some of these mechs is blowing my god damn mind
[3:06:11] <xeros720> fuck, he did it again
[3:06:13] <%Verd_254> Some mechanics are universal, but there's no accounting for new shit.
[3:06:14] <damienlunas> Good job beating the boss, Pat
[3:06:15] <deadbeat34> Does that mean you won't stream the Nier raid?
[3:06:16] <Forester_Skippy> i have been in 8 clear parties for savage that cant clear the orb phase of e1s because people dont stand on their spots all day i feel you pat
[3:06:22] <scritchez> sensory overload is a thing too
[3:06:24] <BunnyEmperor> monkaS Titania EX tether flashbacks
[3:06:27] <xeros720> i wish i could watch that guy, he's probably mashing all his buttons
[3:06:28] <$Billyuppercut0> Are healers noob friendly
[3:06:29] <KatabolicRage> oh one point about that tether, don't grab it if your the tank, you'll die to the next tankbuster
[3:06:31] <mr_slaide> DON'T JINX IT
[3:06:34] <Valdorick> don't be a hero, Dancer
[3:06:34] <damienlunas> You've basically already won
[3:06:37] <keiji_maede> THE FUCKING DPS GREED

[3:24:19] <Finaldragoon> it's the same character in every FF

[3:24:23] <@SSaryn> waow
[3:24:23] <%Zamorouskiwhich> wao
[3:24:28] <%DedlokPM> I love how Gilgamesh admits how because he missed his companion Enkidu so much he takes a rooster and paints it green and calls it Enkidu
[3:24:29] <%Estuko> @AmaniIsYourBoss really??? I figured him bein in 012 and being a lot of fun, he'd totally make it in NT
[3:24:32] <RamenRiderZ> This is the only time Griffin Crossing has been used :(

[3:24:42] <+floralkami> @angriestpat are you planning on playing Remnant: From the Ashes? I value your opinion on souls likes way more than most, and would love to hear your opinion on the gameplay (not so much the story).

[3:25:41] <Guardiansaiyan> @AmaniIsYourBoss the new character being added in to NT doesn't need to be paid for right?
[3:25:52] <corrosivePaladin> Have you tried any of the Density raids yet?
[3:25:53] <%Aeoneth> And then do a raid on Destiny amiright?
[3:25:56] <+Ryan1016> Long stream today?

[3:27:58] <senatorarmstrong_2020> biggest sand bag
[3:27:59] <Guardiansaiyan> @Nobrev like Tifa for example. I don't really pay for DLC since I am cheap and just play the game without buy the extras offered
[3:27:59] <Finaldragoon> this dungeon is literally BibleThump The Area

[3:28:25] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> That's a Kenny level dad joke
[3:28:26] <%frankthetank285> finally
[3:28:34] <IndoorSitup> I TOTALLY MISSED THAT
[3:28:43] <+Darastrix> But @angriestpat what about fighting the doofy yellow thunderbird?
[3:28:45] <+Tiewolf> what is the Boss theme from T.O.P. started playing
[3:28:53] <+Tiewolf> like in game
[3:28:59] <Thalchampz> Kappa
[3:29:01] <%Nobrev> @Guardiansaiyan oh yeah you do have to pay for tifa. and all the other like 5 or 6 dlc characters. I think you can buy them in bundles or season passes for a little cheaper though
[3:29:06] <@SSaryn> Second Swallow? Kappa
[3:29:11] <KatabolicRage> the second swallow thing seems to almost be a japanese trope or I guess it's from some kinda old story
[3:29:14] <mihokspawn> Because you like Fate/Stay Nighrt XD
[3:29:14] <$valriot> Second Swallow huh Kappa Kappa
[3:29:16] <KatabolicRage> I've seen it in other things too
[3:29:20] <tigerfang86> watch out for that second swallow
[3:29:23] <Daniel_Is_I> Nope
[3:29:24] <$valriot> Paige taught it you when you visited Japan
[3:29:26] <Cactuskris> what instance is this
[3:29:29] <Thalchampz> i don't remember you doing it
[3:29:29] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> "Watch out for the Second Swallow..."
[3:29:30] <%genowyn> Aerial Ace in Pokemon is also Tsubame Gaeshi in jp
[3:29:32] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Twinning is PogChamp
[3:29:35] <Thalchampz> OH YEAH
[3:29:36] <$Thatghostpepper> nope @AngriestPat
[3:29:39] <%Owkono> I remember it from prince of tennis
[3:29:45] <ittla> twinning is fun to tank
[3:29:47] <Thalchampz> man SE should do some DDOS protection shit
[3:29:49] <ittla> big pull
[3:29:51] <rosemon5001> look at that man run whit his tiny axe
[3:29:52] <%Typhaeon> Cutscenes in the Twinning add a lot
[3:29:52] <Daniel_Is_I> Twinning is one of the best dungeons in the game
[3:29:52] <+KoyaMusa> tsubame gaeshi means swallow counter what do you mean
[3:29:53] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Twinning was so damn fun
[3:29:54] <%Laecerelius> twinning is great
[3:29:55] <LittleBigQuebec> Chicken Tenders ROCKiest ver.
[3:29:59] <%starotter70> Yeah
[3:30:01] <$valriot> It's good but the bosses and pulls are FUCKING AWFUL

[3:30:11] <garbageheaphound> no
[3:30:11] <bathoi> twinning is hype

[3:30:18] <+PenmanLupine> is twinning when 2 guys rub their dicks together?
[3:30:20] <senatorarmstrong_2020> no
[3:30:20] <jellssssss20> Nope
[3:30:20] <gustavozxd> no
[3:30:21] <TioXyco> twinning is about CERTIFIED BANGER
[3:30:24] <%Metballs> Twinning best dungeon
[3:30:24] <ittla> the twinning is alright, I like anyder more
[3:30:25] <%Ranryu692> no clue
[3:30:26] <Kain5707> its so fucking good
[3:30:28] <Thalchampz> IT IS
[3:30:29] <KVD22> it's not the best
[3:30:29] <+Darastrix> I do
[3:30:30] <%audrus> twinning is when 2 ginger twins date each other and monetize it on twitch
[3:30:31] <%RedKnightVI> Best music
[3:30:32] <%audrus> hey o
[3:30:34] <%BlueMoonBlues> i prefer akademia
[3:30:34] <%Master_Van> Super good
[3:30:36] <%Ilpala> we're IN the best
[3:30:39] <Acidshocker> I don't know anything about this game.
[3:30:39] <LittleBigQuebec> @AngriestPat Twinning is the only thing that makes me do expert daily
[3:30:40] <RavenHellkite> if you don't know what it is just boost the volume up
[3:30:41] <KVD22> no u
[3:30:43] <+RittiFruity> They need to put more savage mechanic in dungeon
[3:30:43] <%Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat hey pat hope paige is feeling a little Bette today sending you both energy love ya
[3:30:44] <+Tarage> Know what sucks in the Twinning? When you fight a boss and the music changes.
[3:30:45] <+RoByte2> You can sum up the Twinning with "Why Cid, why?"
[3:30:48] <Forester_Skippy> its such a love letter to every single raid
[3:30:52] <%Mega_Pengers> that dungeon is like coke
[3:30:53] <Filthy_Acts> People who say it's not the best didn't run HW raids.
[3:30:54] <MaeMae94> Good fights, good visuals, good references, AMAZING music, best by far
[3:30:55] <KVD22> akademia is superior tbh
[3:30:55] <@SSaryn> Too bad that blasted boss music has to be ruining the Twinning's music
[3:30:59] <Daniel_Is_I> Twinning is also really cool lore-wise
[3:31:00] <+Grizzytron> yeah worst part of the twinning is when you fight the bosses
[3:31:05] <Pnutz409> I know of the Shinning from The Simpsons.
[3:31:06] <KatabolicRage> amaurot has a good theme but I don't care for the bosses
[3:31:08] <ittla> I like akadaemia anyder and amaurot more than the twinning tbh
[3:31:08] <+KoyaMusa> @AngriestPat tsubame gaeshi translates to swallow counter actually, not second swallow
[3:31:20] <%Nobrev> the twinning is super the best. especially if you understand all the lore and implications surrounding it
[3:31:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> No it isn't. Well is the best dungeon in the game. Twinning is cool too, but my favorite one is Well because of Buckethead.
[3:31:32] <Lanka14> Oh this dungeon, i did it once and my other dps, a bard decided to only use his dots for like 1/3 of the dungeon. You know, the thing that enables most of his abilities
[3:31:35] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> This and the Twinning are the best right now. I love the atmosphere of Amaurot too much personally.
[3:31:36] <%vaporousTippler> E1M1 intensifies.
[3:31:37] <%Estuko> monkaS WutFace
[3:31:37] <%Aeoneth> OH Hi Kaathe
[3:31:47] <KVD22> doom slug
[3:31:47] <artoflec> ah taht big caterpillar thing is really creepy looking
[3:31:48] <+Grizzytron> oh, worm?
[3:31:50] <Lanka14> Not even for the boss fights
[3:31:52] <+lemurbreeder> i wish it didn't cut to the boss music here
[3:31:54] <%starotter70> Hit it's mouth butt
[3:31:56] <LittleBigQuebec> honestly Yoshida is gigabrain with the lore behind the twinning
[3:32:05] <%arcaderabbit48> It has mouths all over
[3:32:08] <Daniel_Is_I> It's just a shame Amaurot's bosses are kinda shit
[3:32:35] <%sourceofall> you missed 2 enpi;s there
[3:32:40] <Finaldragoon> @AngriestPat would you say this is the best Expert Roulette set of dungeons we've ever had?
[3:32:42] <Lanka14> Eh the 1st and 3rd bosses are pretty good, 2nd one is just lazy.
[3:33:09] <ittla> the expert roulette would be good if I got anything other than twinning
[3:33:25] <Daniel_Is_I> "Hey it's the last story dungeon of the game. What should we make the 2nd boss?" "Uh... adds."
[3:33:27] <ittla> a cool dungeon becomes less cool when you've done it 20 times
[3:33:27] <%arcaderabbit48> Second boss is really awesome from a lore standpoint because it helps make clear just how fucked things were, but as an actual boss it... well, its not really a boss
[3:33:32] <Jdrockefeller> I agree
[3:33:32] <+Venhammer> definitely best ex roulette in terms of music
[3:33:34] <Basch71> its better than Stormblood's early experts
[3:33:43] <Ner234> The First Beast. That name is strong.
[3:33:59] <Jdrockefeller> I loved fractal continuum but I hated that it was paired with nevereap

[3:38:19] <TioXyco> fa lalalala
[3:38:24] <%Gogogolem> Whats that Smell its BLUD!
[3:38:26] <%AquilaHarukaze> Titania hands down
[3:38:27] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Hey Pat are you a little M O T I V A T E D?
[3:38:28] <LittleBigQuebec> Dying gasp imho
[3:38:31] <+Silentman0> best trial music is battle on the bridge obviously
[3:38:36] <LittleBigQuebec> or hell's kier trial
[3:38:36] <%Typhaeon> Ravana
[3:38:37] <TioXyco> although.... Final Boss is AMAZING
[3:38:40] <LittleBigQuebec> or ravana
[3:38:48] <@Mechz71> Best trial music is final steps of faith
[3:38:50] <nsDrummer> has pat done any savage?
[3:38:57] <+Silentman0> no he's too much of a coward
[3:39:04] <nsDrummer> Kappa
[3:39:34] <LittleBigQuebec> or THE SEAS PART FOR WE ALONE
[3:39:47] <TioXyco> RESILENT SOULS, I SALUTE YOU!
[3:39:57] <%Ilpala> ....yeaaaaa
[3:40:00] <+metalsiren31> Tsukuyomi though
[3:40:01] <Kain5707> Dragonsong?
[3:40:06] <wunderkindest> Final Steps of Faith is cheating
[3:40:09] <Kain5707> it will always be best
[3:40:10] <TioXyco> yeah, dragonsong
[3:40:10] <Basch71> Thordan EX shits on it
[3:40:12] <%miguelrod777> THE FINAL VERSE IS SUNG
[3:40:13] <$valriot> No but the fight is whatever
[3:40:14] <%Gogogolem> There are very few losers in this game.
[3:40:16] <nsDrummer> thordan or shinryu
[3:40:17] <%RedKnightVI> I'm partial to Sophia "Equilibrium'
[3:40:20] <%sshen> MOOGLE MOG
[3:40:20] <+Silentman0> tsukuyomi and shiva are both up there
[3:40:22] <Forester_Skippy> well i agree for phase 1 but 2 and 3 get outclassed by a few other trails easily
[3:40:25] <wunderkindest> That's like saying that Highlander has the best movie soundtrack
[3:40:25] <%Ilpala> like chaos is still a cooler moment than final steps. but final steps has better music
[3:40:28] <Lanka14> what a fun boooooss timeeee
[3:40:30] <%Ilpala> ][
[3:40:30] <+Tarage> FACE CHICKEN
[3:40:36] <%faeron93> Ramuh is so strong for me
[3:40:38] <CybertronPrime> Mega Ultra Chicken
[3:40:43] <@SSaryn> Tsukuyomi, Oblivion - Shiva, and Equilibruim.
[3:41:04] <Renuarb> With the way Eden SAVED Leviathan's theme, I'm excited to hear the Garuda, Ifrit, etc remixes
[3:41:10] <Calern> tsukuyomi, shinryu, ramuh, thordan, ravana, there's too many
[3:41:15] <%Ilpala> equilibrium has best lyrics
[3:41:16] <+Silentman0> wayward daughter blew my ass out the first time i heard it like "wow why isn't anyone else talking about this"
[3:41:19] <+RoByte2> Everyone knows the best song is Pa-Paya
[3:41:23] <Forester_Skippy> god thordans theme is so fucking good
[3:41:27] <%Typhaeon> Ifrit might even get a memorable theme this time
[3:41:29] <%DeathsDoom> lakshimi
[3:41:44] <Lanka14> wait we talking themes? Omega - eScape is pretty good
[3:41:51] <$Thatghostpepper> for those non ff14 players, if you want a playlist of all current music of this game whisp me for the link if you guys want it
[3:42:03] <%Typhaeon> The least memorable one besides Ifrit has to be Jhen Mohran - I mean Bismarck
[3:42:06] <$Thatghostpepper> it's youtube link tho
[3:42:16] <%arcaderabbit48> I think its safe to say by the discussion in the chat that this game is full of fucking amazing music
[3:42:19] <Renuarb> No way, Bismarck is totally relaxing
[3:42:24] <Renuarb> I love using his birb sometime when I'm flying around
[3:42:25] <Calern> all of the alexander raid too
[3:42:26] <Lanka14> Bismarck is amazing
[3:42:38] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> All the FF14 OSTs are up on Spotify btw
[3:42:43] <+metalsiren31> A shorter discussion would be which tracks are NOT good
[3:42:46] <Cowctus> alex prime is best tbh
[3:42:49] <%Typhaeon> Cell's gonna blow!
[3:42:53] <Calern> agree
[3:42:56] <%arcaderabbit48> @metalsiren31 la-HEE
[3:43:01] <KoyFoster> Starting today? I could find Crycus Tower.
[3:43:01] <Basch71> Ifrit is probably the whackest
[3:43:03] <+metalsiren31> pvpWhy
[3:43:05] <+Tarage> ULTRA MEGA CHICKEN
[3:43:06] <Forester_Skippy> rise, locus and metal are really good
[3:43:07] <frostech8> Sephirot's theme is great
[3:43:08] <KoyFoster> cundn't*
[3:43:14] <+Tarage> SPESS
[3:43:14] <Renuarb> AND THEN YOU LET IT INSIDE!!!
[3:43:23] <Thalchampz> moon's haunted.
[3:43:30] <%arcaderabbit48> Time for Pop Off
[3:43:30] <+Tarage> SPACE LAZORS
[3:43:32] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> So good
[3:43:39] <night__monkey> i really don't think they can ever make a dungeon this good again
[3:43:42] <Daniel_Is_I> Planet's burnin'
[3:43:44] <%arcaderabbit48> God, the moon in 14 is so unbelievably haunted
[3:43:45] <IndoorSitup> this part was so hype
[3:43:49] <Calern> god i flipped my shit when i saw this
[3:43:57] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Does the world end at the End of the Game?
[3:43:59] <+metalsiren31> So when's Lunatic Pandora
[3:43:59] <%starotter70> Night Time!? PogChamp
[3:43:59] <Lanka14> Sephirot phase 2 theme is just devil may cry music
[3:44:02] <Finaldragoon> Another streamer put it best, "32-Bit support died for this"
[3:44:08] <Cowctus> So when does Soreiro Days start playing?
[3:44:11] <+mattymcfilth> @angriestpat how is page doing?
[3:44:19] <IndoorSitup> PS3 support died for this.
[3:44:25] <PrinceOfEden> I need this song right now
[3:44:28] <PrinceOfEden> Someone tell me the name
[3:44:31] <PrinceOfEden> I beg of you

[3:44:43] <Daniel_Is_I> @TurtlesAndTentacles This whole dungeon is an illusory flashback of the first time the world ended
[3:44:48] <%Ascethetic> i wonder what this game would look like if ps4 support died
[3:44:52] <%HeySeuss> This really IS a final anime song
[3:44:52] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Woah it's the battle over Coruscant in Episode III

[3:49:33] <possumwalsh1221> Titanic too big Paige good big
[3:49:34] <%worldbrand> aw yeah this is video games
[3:49:35] <%velemi> SourPls
[3:49:36] <Birdigalore> Paige "Titanic 2" Ladyboivin
[3:49:48] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Yo this music is hype af
[3:49:55] <Nina96> cant hear a word paige is saying, what she saying?
[3:49:56] <+Tarage> Paige more baba!
[3:49:58] <Monkeyweed21> she already is
[3:50:02] <%joylent_blue> eventually she stopped hearing
[3:50:05] <dredshift> WHO'S TALKING
[3:50:06] <possumwalsh1221> Don’t let Paige near icebergs just in case
[3:50:07] <Videogamer4> anyone know the song name?
[3:50:17] <%DedlokPM> @Renuarb He did get kicked off of fiver but I don't think it was necessarily because of the "credit card number" thinf. I forget the exact reason though
[3:50:18] <Birdigalore> Pat getting distracted by the love!
[3:50:18] <%arcaderabbit48> @Gray_skies1993 As one might expect from such a plot relevant dungeon of a Final Fantasy game, there's a lot of biblical symbolism getting thrown around here. Thankfully its not nearly as blunt as ti usually is
[3:50:19] <+s_snowball> SourPls
[3:50:20] <$Dakuu75> dude, I miss having to cast protect and shell. it was like... one of my fave whm things to do. odd as that sounds
[3:50:20] <%Ascethetic> @videogamer4 insatiable
[3:50:21] <%Ilpala> is there a tell for which row fires first or are you just supposed to get out of the way since it's a multi-hit attack?
[3:50:24] <%Jp3g95> Pat is an iceberg
[3:50:26] <%starotter70> She would go swimming in the ocean, shouting: WHO SAID THAT!?
[3:50:36] <Quietshun13> this song is the shadowbringers boss theme, dunno the actual name
[3:50:36] <Videogamer4> @ascethetic thx
[3:50:41] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Pat's an iceberg made out of frozen trash
[3:50:42] <+Tarage> Paige is an Iceberg but Pat is a fatberg.
[3:50:47] <deadbeat34> You're fighting an armore with four faces and wings.
[3:50:48] <%Remery_> Pat is a slutty roast beef sandwich
[3:50:49] <$Thatghostpepper> if you guys want a youtube link to these music whisp me and I'll send it
[3:51:04] <+KoyaMusa> god what a toxic abuser
[3:51:19] <ScreamLord> I looked away for 2 minutes and now Pat's fighting a griffon with cathedral for a face
[3:51:26] <possumwalsh1221> LUL
[3:51:29] <%MoonObscure> xD
[3:51:29] <%Gray_skies1993> @arcaderabbit48 true, subtle biblical symbolism in games/media is underrated imo
[3:51:31] <Reanimator83> I can feel Paige ordering McDonald’s LUL
[3:51:32] <$OmegaWeltall> i just noticed this boss is just a Nilfilheim troop carrier from FF15 with some extra shit on it
[3:51:39] <%Gray_skies1993> the obvious shit is terrible though
[3:51:48] <%Unlimited_> This music 👌
[3:51:50] <$Quigsies> Hey Paige, what's pats deal with bees?
[3:51:50] <%Capta1n_H3nry> #SavePat
[3:51:51] <%Ascethetic> @angriestpat lol youre a marshmallow
[3:51:51] <%starotter70> Paige would be on C
[3:51:58] <%ssjklyco> Lewd
[3:52:00] <wunderkindest> @OmegaWeltall Yeah, a lot of ShB enemies are ripped and modified from 13
[3:52:01] <Daniel_Is_I> Wouldn't that just be Sans?
[3:52:03] <+Tarage> Pat is gonna cosplay as Sans?
[3:52:07] <%SlashHabit> why are you fighting a piano?
[3:52:09] <count_bob> ....
[3:52:09] <%Ilpala> Yea facetank that ray pat
[3:52:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> Now SWEEP THE DICK
[3:52:14] <Monkeyweed21> Paige knows the Keijo moves
[3:52:16] <%Remery_> the breasts
[3:52:16] <count_bob> Flopsy and Mopsy?
[3:52:17] <+Xanezz> well okay now we know the names
[3:52:18] <+Tarage> Paige could be the other one.
[3:52:19] <%ssjklyco> She used her clappers to ensnare pat
[3:52:20] <%Faustgesicht> ENABLER
[3:52:21] <$OmegaWeltall> @wunderkindest yea new Titan looks like somethign form 13
[3:52:21] <+Xanezz> ok then
[3:52:22] <possumwalsh1221> Pat is simple, you shake boob he do thing
[3:52:23] <%Typhaeon> THose rays are great for exfoliation
[3:52:25] <Nina96> cause y not?
[3:52:30] <%Gogogolem> Also thats clearly an accordian
[3:52:33] <a_mad_dragon> is this crypt of the necrodancer?
[3:52:37] <Lanka14> Face tank that shit and yell "Healer adjust!"
[3:52:43] <%Gray_skies1993> WE FALL
[3:52:43] <darcfowler1995> the piano is a bad doggo
[3:52:44] <%miguelrod777> pianos are scary
[3:52:45] <xelomaimhov> FFXIV is actually the sequel to Mario 64. That's what the piano becomes.
[3:52:46] <%starotter70> This song is amazing
[3:52:47] <%BlitzNeidhart> WE FALL
[3:52:47] <%Remery_> it's obviously a trombone
[3:52:48] <%Tearonex> something something big god dude
[3:52:50] <+Silentman0> long story short: the bad guys used to make things out of mind power but for some reason they stopped being able to control it and pianos destroyed their universe
[3:52:51] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Pat, if you and Woolie were skeletons, we would really be in an Undertale AU
[3:52:53] <$Dakuu75> FF has a long standing of making "God" a boss fight. I love it. I love getting to murder GOD lol
[3:52:54] <Warnel22> WE FALL
[3:52:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> He's beating up the end of the world.
[3:52:57] <+dawsfloss> I play ESO as my go to MMO but pats terrible play style has convinced me to try FF
[3:52:57] <Forester_Skippy> the short version is the world is fucked and peoples fear for pianos mad ethat thing i guess
[3:53:00] <+Xanezz> Torso Floppers
[3:53:00] <deadbeat34> Its an armore
[3:53:17] <%Gray_skies1993> @Dakuu75 especially if said god is an evil/twisted fuck

[3:53:57] <+Venhammer> @dawsfloss What's awful about it
[3:54:00] <%DedlokPM> @Renuarb actually looking into it it does look like it was because of it. I thhought it was because of something related to how much work he was getting/they weren't paying him. My bad.
[3:54:03] <Forester_Skippy> time to turn up that music
[3:54:07] <+Venhammer> I got shoebill like my third run

[3:57:19] <Forester_Skippy> yes your in the tower actually
[3:57:20] <Quietshun13> it is
[3:57:21] <+dawsfloss> Pat your char looks cool, like hes gonna go run the British outta Scotland
[3:57:24] <@Mechz71> Read the lore books in the dungeon for the stream Pat
[3:57:26] <+Silentman0> i love how bigg's great grandson just fucking tore this place apart
[3:57:26] <%Ilpala> @Dakuu75 don't worry we'll fight bigger
[3:57:30] <alrobot2014> ooooh
[3:57:31] <Mexrage> omega, not alex
[3:57:31] <+datmegamandeeeee> Its a remix of ct and omega
[3:57:35] <@Velyndra> Crystal Tower X Omega X Alex
[3:57:38] <KatabolicRage> and he is currently inside the crystal tower no less
[3:57:41] <%GarbageNirvana> Alex comes later
[3:57:45] <+Bigdrifter210> so nearly 2 months of playing im about to hit shadowbringers any class i should play?
[3:57:46] <%GarbageNirvana> You'll see
[3:57:51] <@Velyndra> Its my new fanfic
[3:57:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> this is the crystal tower, after all.
[3:58:01] <%zamzoph> Oh god, this place is giving me flashbacks to that awful place in FF12
[3:58:07] <+metalsiren31> Whichever class you like best. There's no real story connection to any class in ShB
[3:58:07] <$OmegaWeltall> that bassist is fuggen killing it on this track Kreygasm
[3:58:08] <%GarbageNirvana> @Bigdrifter210 They're all more or less viable, just go with what you've enjoyed playing the most
[3:58:12] <Thalchampz> this is G'raha Tia's Rave Tower
[3:58:12] <Forester_Skippy> meanwhile random coil boss as a mob for good mesuer
[3:58:13] <ovan20> @AngriestPat is the cristal tower bigger in the inside? monkaS
[3:58:17] <$Dakuu75> OH, where's my mod that lets me change that launch sound to the sonic spring sfx, lol
[3:58:25] <Ner234> @zamzoph Oh Goh why'd you remind me NotLikeThis
[3:58:35] <+RoByte2> This place also has a bunch of FF13 mobs, including the first two bosses
[3:58:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Though I will say you're gonna want at least one tank, healer, phys DPS, and magic DPS all current
[3:58:46] <TurtlesAndTentacles> LIKE A TARDIS
[3:58:48] <+Tarage> This is the basement.
[3:58:49] <Lanka14> I absolutely love the last boss in this dungeon, reference to small thing in MSQ, my favourite music and the look of it is amazing.
[3:58:50] <MaeMae94> It's a big tardis
[3:58:57] <Forester_Skippy> tower also goes down a large bit
[3:59:05] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Whovians unite
[3:59:08] <%Ilpala> last boss is a hybrid of ff13 boss and alex
[3:59:16] <IndoorSitup> we talkin about the tower or pat's butthole?
[3:59:22] <+Tarage> Both
[3:59:29] <CatsEyeBlind> The only downside to this dungeon is the music changes to something lamer during the first two boss fights
[3:59:34] <MaeMae94> Pat's butthole is bigger on the inside LUL
[3:59:41] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:41] <Lanka14> Also a reference to a Coffee Machine Tataru has
[3:59:44] <Forester_Skippy> so ther eis kaliya for all you nutjobs that did coil back in the day
[3:59:52] <$Dakuu75> level with me DPS nerds. Is it better to single-target and murder something or AOE everything? I'm sure it must depend on how many you're fighting, eh
[3:59:59] <Nina96> no
[3:59:59] <+metalsiren31> I love that there's a teeny T11 in here
[4:00:00] <Kain5707> Kain5707 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Stay_Hydrated_Bot! They have given 6 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[4:00:00] <+Bigdrifter210> @garbagenirvana im prob gonna buy a white mage skip because fuck leveling that class same goes for black mage
[4:00:01] <Thalchampz> too late
[4:00:03] <%StripesUltimateEdition> monkaS
[4:00:06] <%Capta1n_H3nry> IT'S LIKE THE TARDIS
[4:00:11] <KatabolicRage> rule of thumb is, 3 or more enemies? more efficient to aoe
[4:00:12] <%GarbageNirvana> Hey, it's your money
[4:00:12] <%Ranryu692> the Tardass
[4:00:13] <%TheSniperJoe> ...I mean...aren't ALL buttholes bigger on the inside?
[4:00:14] <IndoorSitup> MAYBE I WILL
[4:00:15] <%NWR_James> Forbidden Butthole Knowledge
[4:00:15] <ShichiNoBushi> Pat's butt hole is non-euclidian.
[4:00:16] <%Remery_> hahaha
[4:00:18] <sosuke5> @AngriestPat Finish FF12, you coward
[4:00:18] <+RoByte2> @Dakuu75 Easy rule of thumb, AoE on 3 or more
[4:00:18] <gustavozxd> I need to know
[4:00:21] <Lanka14> @Dakuu75 I useally just AoE if theres 3+ enemies in a pull
[4:00:23] <alrobot2014> if its like the tardis, does that mean its got its own conciousness?
[4:00:25] <%Gray_skies1993> MUSIQ
[4:00:29] <SweepTheLegoMyEggo> oh man that could hold soooo much poop
[4:00:29] <Ser_Randal> Is it a reverse knot?
[4:00:29] <%NWR_James> there is going to be so much salt
[4:00:31] <%Ascethetic> DO NOT boost a healet
[4:00:32] <Nina96> there will be much salt
[4:00:32] <%SlowLikeThunder> @Dakuu75 Depends on the specific attack but generally at 3+ enemies is when the AoE moves do better overall potency
[4:00:36] <%Ascethetic> healer*
[4:00:36] <possumwalsh1221> Says a giant pile of salt
[4:00:37] <%starotter70> Pfffft
[4:00:38] <gustavozxd> DENINIS
[4:00:45] <%SwdVengeance> Salt prescription
[4:00:52] <$Dakuu75> @RoByte2 @Lanka14 @SlowLikeThunder *Dakuu will remember that* thank you~
[4:00:53] <+Tarage> AND NOW THE MUSIC SUCKS
[4:01:01] <MaeMae94> Hype break everyone chill for 5
[4:01:04] <Thalchampz> watch the healer break the glasses and fucking everything up
[4:01:05] <+Silentman0> it's not even the good shadowbringers boss music
[4:01:07] <Ser_Randal> Ewwww
[4:01:09] <%StripesUltimateEdition> THIS BOSS TRACK apatWrong
[4:01:11] <%GarbageNirvana> How many holding tanks do you think they'll break in this fight
[4:01:15] <sosuke5> Paige's stream be like: How DARE you encourage me! On my stream!
[4:01:15] <%VioletHeart> The music isn't even bad, it's just...
[4:01:17] <keiji_maede> @AngriestPat Pat... I'm new to the tank thing and I don't know what to put into mine gear so please help me out!? >.< I'm trying tanking with PLD & DRK
[4:01:17] <Lanka14> Dont break the god damn glass pat
[4:01:19] <%VioletHeart> Not the Twinning...

[4:02:46] <alrobot2014> especially when they heave you into the air
[4:02:47] <Forester_Skippy> you cana ctually stay in those flames for the 2nd stack doesnt hurt that much
[4:02:51] <alrobot2014> you get the full view

[4:04:31] <%Capta1n_H3nry> IN THE MUD IT'S SINKING DEEPER
[4:04:34] <Basch71> now to see if this healer's good
[4:04:35] <%starotter70> @KishinGrek This song
[4:04:35] <count_bob> Good Jorb Pat.
[4:04:38] <Forester_Skippy> the pul lafter this is fucked make em seat there dont itnerupt that beserk
[4:04:59] <%walternatorz> pat done with final mission? no more spoilers?
[4:05:03] <KishinGrek> It really is
[4:05:30] <%Nobrev> REMINDER people who pull both boilbusters are fucking psychopaths
[4:05:32] <$Dakuu75> damn it... this makes me wanna re-sub and play samurai so bad, lol
[4:05:35] <Lanka14> Man i wish i had more fun AoE as bard :/
[4:05:42] <KatabolicRage> he's in the twinning which does have some tangential spoilers
[4:05:48] <TurtlesAndTentacles> this sounds like a power rangers song
[4:05:48] <Basch71> that pull is easy
[4:05:50] <%Typhaeon> Both boilbusters are fine, just understand Venn diagrams Kappa
[4:05:52] <Basch71> this is harder
[4:05:55] <Quietshun13> ff13 flans
[4:05:55] <Forester_Skippy> @Nobrev thanks man i aim for that
[4:05:56] <%Gray_skies1993> something about a good drum kit, electric guitar riffs, and synth craziness seems to always sound awesome in the hands of a good composer/musician
[4:06:03] <Jdrockefeller> yeah it's kinda spoilers once you hit last boss
[4:06:27] <%skizzuto> I would very much like to resub to ff14 but unfortunately med school is a thing I have to do
[4:06:35] <+metalsiren31> Not double pulling here? Coward
[4:06:40] <Forester_Skippy> ^
[4:06:42] <%ssjklyco> I kinda want to resub, but farthest I've ever got was to level 15 and just on vanilla 14.
[4:06:44] <Forester_Skippy> big cowardice
[4:06:47] <Basch71> ^
[4:06:56] <%StripesUltimateEdition> baby WHM
[4:07:01] <KishinGrek> God ive been wanting to play a jrpg recently but i cant find a good one ,leaning towards digimon on ps4
[4:07:04] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat they're not quite just stronger Tylenol, but you also shouldn't mix things like Tylenol/Advil/Etc.
[4:07:06] <ittla> I usually double pull on this but you gotta look out for the fresh healer
[4:07:07] <Forester_Skippy> that pull is really forgiving with a whitemage tho
[4:07:09] <@SSaryn> Those big swipes those goos do are nuts
[4:07:09] <+metalsiren31> They're a white mage, they can handle it pvpLUL
[4:07:10] <%miguelrod777> trail ny fire is the name of the game
[4:07:14] <$valriot> All the pulls in this dungeon suck
[4:07:17] <$valriot> and the bosses
[4:07:20] <Lanka14> Man i gotta go back to Alex Savage and get some of the weps.
[4:07:26] <$valriot> Basically everything is trash but the song
[4:07:27] <ovan20> healers can adjust rooCarry
[4:07:35] <Kain5707> @KishinGrek do you like souls games?
[4:07:39] <Basch71> whm has divine benison and benediction and holy
[4:07:41] <@Mechz71> @valriot LUL

[4:07:50] <Basch71> whm is completely fine LuL
[4:08:05] <Forester_Skippy> always pul lwall to wall and ignore the healers except if its an astro then you jsut laugh at their panic
[4:08:09] <+metalsiren31> I know, WHM is OP
[4:08:11] <%korth367> baby pulls for big babies
[4:08:15] <@SSaryn> REMEMBER FF13?

[4:09:57] <$Quigsies> Remember when ffxiii didn't have any like actual roaming or world map until like... I don't know how many hours in?
[4:09:59] <%Boscuito> its on the never shrinking list
[4:10:21] <Kain5707> yea i watched someone play it earlier today it comes out tuesday but if you buy it now you get early access
[4:10:25] <Basch71> and the games sucked harder after gran pulse LuL

[4:18:22] <+metalsiren31> Wiping on Twinning isn't so bad. Akadamia though...

[4:18:26] <%Nobrev> i am jamming the FUCK OUT rn in hoh
[4:18:28] <%gespenst25> gespenst25 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! Hi pat. On Part 4 of JoJo now, damnit Joseph. Interesting seeing a part I didn't know spoilers about 10 years ago though (The World etc). All I knew about 4 was that Yoshikage Kira wants a quiet life, didn't even know what it meant.
[4:18:30] <+SaintValiance> What's the name of the song?
[4:18:31] <darcfowler1995> this is some Tupperware remix Party shit
[4:18:33] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[4:18:34] <KishinGrek> Battle battle
[4:18:35] <Jarvanii> falling back right into the system SourPls
[4:18:39] <+metalsiren31> Aside from that first room if you pull to the wall, that pull is ridiculous
[4:18:39] <$Dakuu75> man, does no one eat food before runs anymore?
[4:18:40] <%Typhaeon> Locus is the name of the track
[4:18:41] <%Metballs> Locus - Primals version
[4:18:46] <Lanka14> the Whole of the Alexander raid tier is just a giant god damn rave
[4:18:55] <%Rngiddion> Rngiddion subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! Thanks for helping me get back into FF14. The Titan build up killed me last time but I finished Shadowbringers and am gearing up to raid with some friends!
[4:18:57] <Lanka14> Locus is from the first tier of Alexander
[4:18:57] <Futurecity10> I personally fucking hate this song
[4:19:04] <%gespenst25> Is the beast that's sleeping Elmo?
[4:19:05] <@DariusFTL> Rise is still my favorite track from Alexander
[4:19:08] <Luesagna00> is terrible D:
[4:19:11] <Tucker0603> love this song
[4:19:12] <sjcodan> Sonic BOOM
[4:19:15] <%Ilpala> Gotta be Brute Justice
[4:19:17] <Kain5707> explain the fight to them
[4:19:18] <+metalsiren31> Song is fantastic
[4:19:19] <Basch71> now we just gotta fight pepsiman, again Kappa
[4:19:25] <sjcodan> Dont explain SHIT
[4:19:26] <+SaintValiance> Locus, got it. Ty
[4:19:26] <Quietshun13> I don't hate any music in this game
[4:19:27] <%Metballs> Metal - Brute Justice is better
[4:19:28] <IndoorSitup> Why does almost every vocal song in this game have borderline unintelligible music?
[4:19:29] <%SWFanatic> SWFanatic subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Just finished rewatching the silent hill 2 LP again. Now going to go through Godhand again. Thanks for helping me keep my sanity as I study for board exams.
[4:19:31] <Forester_Skippy> all 5 themse in alxander are great
[4:19:33] <%Metballs> But this is a solid 10/10
[4:19:34] <KishinGrek> Za wurldo
[4:19:36] <+REDtheBEAST> That cat better not die again walrusMeow
[4:19:51] <CalderGaming> given that the last FF I played all the way through was XII, the music style(s) in XIV are just so bizarre
[4:19:52] <Lanka14> Exponential Entropy can go die though
[4:19:53] <@DariusFTL> getting to pilot Brute Justice in pvp is a good time
[4:19:59] <%Louie_Salmon> @indoorsitup Because it's very Japanese
[4:20:07] <%zamzoph> SourPls
[4:20:23] <TurtlesAndTentacles> WOW
[4:20:38] <%sshen> Too bad about it being in PVP Darius
[4:20:46] <Lanka14> Also Rise is top tier music
[4:20:48] <Kain5707> theyre following Pat LUL
[4:20:48] <%gespenst25> Are the red circles not random?
[4:21:00] <asurite_warrior> This music oddly reminds me of powerman worlds collide
[4:21:01] <@DariusFTL> Rival Wings is fine, the trick is not being a coward
[4:21:14] <+SaintValiance> FF 14 soundtrack is S tier in general though
[4:21:15] <Lanka14> A to the L to the Exander come to the rise alexander
[4:21:17] <Lanka14> ;)
[4:21:20] <%GarbageNirvana> @asurite_warrior This isn't the Worlds Collide song, trust me
[4:21:34] <Daniel_Is_I> All of the ARR Primals have jarring music kicks for their phase transitions
