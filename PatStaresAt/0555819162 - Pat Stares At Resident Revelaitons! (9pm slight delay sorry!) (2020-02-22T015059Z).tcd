[0:01:00] <%Sir_stride> how are all you beautiful people doing?
[0:01:09] <+amazinglymarli> RE6 has its place
[0:01:16] <SkyPirateArcane> "Fuck you people" - Pat 2020
[0:01:27] <$DarkKnightGrave> Huh. That's not RE6.
[0:01:29] <YakumoYomi> Classic Patty Cakes.
[0:01:31] <%SirGO0SE> @SkyPirateArcane hope thats his most liked post of 2020
[0:01:42] <%twistedj3ster> I would actually play RE6 if Pat commentated over me, because I'm fine with mediocore TPSs
[0:01:47] <wydamn> I've never seen a good LP of RE6.
[0:01:48] <%radda343> time for more revelaitons

[0:01:48] <SkyPirateArcane> It fucking better be, that shit made me almost cry lol
[0:01:51] <%Ranryu692> I was worried for a bit that people might vote against RE6, but I'm glad most people did the right thing
[0:02:08] <+Cityscape17> hey guys
[0:02:11] <%SirGO0SE> i saw the poll at 50/50 and was worried for a minute

[0:02:54] <%StaceMcGate> Democracy succeeded this week, Pat is playing RE6
[0:03:01] <%Ranryu692> I don't understand why people were voting to see games he's already LP'ed

[0:10:18] <Kemmybelle> Didn't something like this happen on the old channel? You gave a poll with MGS 4 as an option and didn't expect people to pick it?

[0:14:22] <cochramd1992> get gewd skrubs
[0:14:23] <peachy996> What is with Fortnite's growing whining lately?
[0:14:25] <%SirGO0SE> Fairness?! IN MY VIDEO GAMES?!
[0:14:29] <Shonen_hero> has anyone seen that Friends is getting a reunion special?
[0:14:33] <$Dakuu75> Apex Legends got skill based matchmaking a while ago. the solution is literally GET GUD
[0:14:33] <peachy996> What's going on over there
[0:14:35] <cochramd1992> @peachy996 growing?
[0:14:36] <%krawtch> skill based matchmaking murdered TF2 casual because Valve doesn't know how to create balance metrics
[0:14:38] <%Typhaeon> Destiny's is debatably "skill"-based
[0:14:40] <%rytyoung> hey gang!
[0:14:40] <vexicbayn> wah wah wah I can't steamroll for content anymore
[0:14:45] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Wait wtf how do you have a skill based matchmaking WHEN EVERYTHING IS "RANDOM"
[0:14:45] <Psych_man13_13> Oh no, poor ninja
[0:14:47] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Skill based matchmaking is exposing people as frauds who think they're amazing
[0:14:47] <Captain_Joe1911> Hello Paaat cakee5Tuntun
[0:14:49] <butthurtdave> I suck at FPS shooters so i usually end up getting gobsmacked in D2
[0:14:49] <%ElenaManetta> yeah
[0:14:51] <%TheQButton> TheQButton subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Sub for Pat, your Pat! Pat psaDab
[0:14:55] <oniwahoo> Good old confirmation bias~
[0:14:56] <%valkuma> a 50/50 winrate feels like garbage
[0:14:59] <Aydarkzero> but i thought Ninja wanted to get mad at video games Kappa
[0:14:59] <%ElenaManetta> cause the win feels good fora second but the loss feels bad for an hour
[0:15:03] <peachy996> @cochramd1992 All I know of Fortnite is t the gay porn and Ninja memes.
[0:15:04] <%damienlunas> I want skill-based matchmaking, but I NEVER want to see a number. Because seeing the number go down fucking sucks.
[0:15:05] <mattrutland> Poor Ninja, its NOT JUST A GAME TO HIM
[0:15:09] <%Terrabyte_The_Terrible> it's awful in cod, cause high level COD players just camp and it's not nearly as fun
[0:15:12] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Happened with the new Modern Warfare. My main gripe with it is the connection issues.
[0:15:13] <%Typhaeon> Videos aren't predicated on the player being a god, dummies
[0:15:14] <$Dakuu75> as long as I do more damage than my teammates, a loss still feels like a win
[0:15:14] <%ElenaManetta> yeah i play with my elbows
[0:15:15] <Aydarkzero> check out this 50 BOMB
[0:15:16] <cochramd1992> @peachy996 what? gay porn?
[0:15:19] <butthurtdave> If DSP can build a brand off being the absolute worst, so can everyone
[0:15:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ah yes....Ninja.
[0:15:23] <%ssjklyco> They should be able to play the game perfectly every time
[0:15:25] <%Rngiddion> cuz its the ESports pose
[0:15:26] <%crimsonharvest> 50/50 kdr feels bad but i like winning a lot less than most people
[0:15:30] <%worldbrand> arms are not crash
[0:15:30] <ammobasket> duck and weave!
[0:15:31] <%Typhaeon> Entertainment value is as much of a factor in sucking and/or being funny
[0:15:33] <peachy996> @cochramd1992 don't worry about it
[0:15:37] <Aydarkzero> @butthurtdave the best at being the worst
[0:15:44] <Psych_man13_13> Red bars go home
[0:15:44] <%Corporate_Redeemer> TIME TO NUT UP OR SHUT UP, NINJA
[0:15:45] <%ElenaManetta> thank god i live in japan
[0:15:46] <%SirGO0SE> If a battle royale is well balanced, you should win 1 out of every 100 matches :D
[0:15:55] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> People! Pat banned the use of the "N" word! Stop saying ninja!
[0:16:00] <%R3Roundabout> RED BAR WARRIORS! Fuck them!

[0:21:04] <usurper_sos> I'm Pat

[0:21:17] <Monkeyweed21> Eating Mcdorbolds with extra worms

[0:21:24] <%Shadicara> Nah RE8 is gonna be Chris and Joe Baker suplexing and punching all the zambos
[0:21:25] <%SirGO0SE> Billy Sheva and Dante for RE8
[0:21:36] <+The_Butterfly_Man> if re4 gets a remake I want it in classic RE style

[0:46:23] <ammobasket> yup
[0:46:23] <tiaramaki> That's what I hear
[0:46:23] <%MrBorisMakarov> MrBorisMakarov subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! holy shit cant believe I've been here for 3 years, keep on being great
[0:46:23] <+Lunarhawk> yeah adult claire is smokin
[0:46:23] <%Dementedpenguin> ESPECIALLY the ending segment
[0:46:25] <%Lion_kun> Top 5
[0:46:25] <%Neo_Kaiser> No.
[0:46:25] <ha2ken> Because MOIRAAAA
[0:46:26] <%lionandfox21> rev2? Yeah I dig it
[0:46:27] <%OwlLightningMage> It's way better than this
[0:46:27] <%ShichiNoBushi> I remember your LP being pretty good.
[0:46:27] <%xUmbraNinja> Rev2 is great pat
[0:46:27] <%happyface699> Yes
[0:46:27] <%Kegeto> Hell ya
[0:46:27] <%Agami23> right up until the mines rev 2 was amazing
[0:46:27] <%Neo_Kaiser> 2
[0:46:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> BARRY
[0:46:32] <seaechiowai> s okay ish
[0:46:32] <%cervidaequus> REV2 is fucking amazing
[0:46:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oof. That's unfortunate.
[0:46:34] <%bread_assassin> @PatStaresAt You doing that one in Co-op?
[0:46:34] <%rubert_jenkins> love rev 2
[0:46:36] <iamnotaparrot> love barry's va
[0:46:38] <%BalloniWright> yeah but it's no RE6 atpCap
[0:46:40] <%Comradeiota> The finale is amazing
[0:46:40] <+HumanAnimalHybrid> its so dumb the full game is like 24 bucks
[0:46:42] <Divantae> LUL
[0:46:43] <%tusk102> ah rip
[0:46:43] <%Dementedpenguin> Barry is GREAT in that game
[0:46:45] <StarlitStunner> Good with bad monster designs
[0:46:46] <%optimasmaximas> YAY
[0:46:46] <kurejichi> 7/10 was best since 5 at the time
[0:46:47] <%peachy996> Rev2 is really good
[0:46:48] <%SundanceShot> rev2's a good time
[0:46:48] <+HumanAnimalHybrid> which is a steal
[0:46:49] <+lethallylactic> PogChamp
[0:46:49] <%ElenaManetta> co-op with elmo
[0:46:53] <%xxshadowxx416> that was on vita
[0:46:54] <+Tornix> I'm sure Paige will like crow bar duty
[0:46:55] <CheekyBirb> the review is mostly positive from what I saw recently
[0:46:55] <%SirGO0SE> nice
[0:46:56] <%rasterman> the best part of RE6 is the reused maps in rev2
[0:46:56] <+Skelegroove> Rev 2 would be a great co-op stream
[0:46:57] <KeiPrime> remember when barry grew tits and stole everyones moves in street fighter 5
[0:46:57] <Psych_man13_13> @arancet yea, but I would consider sherry to be a returning main character, not a partner never to be seen again
[0:46:59] <%Comradeiota> I thought it was better than 5 even
[0:47:00] <ha2ken> Respect the PIPE
[0:47:01] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Steam dat pipe, gurl
[0:47:02] <%D3rrtyD4n> hot pipe
[0:47:03] <%Dr_DangerPhD> rev2 raid mode was pretty fun as well
[0:47:04] <%Neo_Kaiser> Paige should do RE6 in co-op.
[0:47:04] <+NitronStreams> Jolly Cooperation
[0:47:07] <%NovaKnightmare> @PatStaresAt Doing Rev 2 or Re 6 first?
[0:47:07] <%cervidaequus> Paige: BARRY, the goblins are coming!!!!
[0:47:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I think there's a new gun somewhere in this section.
[0:47:09] <rocksolidfromdragonsdogma> my favorite resident evil.
[0:47:09] <%SilverDevilfish> Pat and Paige Rev 2 co-op Second Raid
[0:47:09] <%Laecerelius> great
[0:47:11] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt I think the reason I had a good time with RE6 coop was that I did it online with full screen real estate
[0:47:13] <%rytisone> I only don't like when you play solo, you have to switch to Moira A LOT to scrounge every room
[0:47:13] <%twistedj3ster> "We didn't patch the pipe, so here's a complex work-around."
[0:47:13] <%OwlLightningMage> You guys totally start Rev2 in coop and never finished
[0:47:14] <sothatsprettybrutal> no good, it's full of steam!
[0:47:16] <%depressed_skeleton> pipes sipsipGasm
[0:47:18] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt I look forward to you having to rely on Paige's eyes in Rev 2
[0:47:21] <iamnotaparrot> rev2 on Vita shits itself suoer hard anytime anything is on screen
[0:47:25] <%Typhaeon> Yeah don't just stop the flow of steam, use this overly complicated lever system to equalize it so we don't have to repair
[0:47:33] <%lutefiiisk> This part sucks
[0:47:33] <iamnotaparrot> including blood vignetting from damage
[0:47:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> now you gotta go down
[0:47:41] <%SilverJakler> I like how Jill still has her signature colors on the bodysuit
[0:47:52] <%PlagueOfGripes> why is your partner such an ugly bastard
[0:47:56] <%D3rrtyD4n> this part? or every part atpRtsd
[0:47:57] <+trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt btw those water monsters were female humans
[0:47:58] <%Dementedpenguin> Parker: I'll do nothing
[0:47:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeaaah...
[0:48:00] <IminyourBase> why she gotta be so thicc tho?
[0:48:02] <%optimasmaximas> its eh
[0:48:02] <%peachy996> I can't unhear the turban guy from RE5 whenever Parker talks
[0:48:05] <%Ranryu692> I look forward to you having to rely on Peach's eyes in Rev 2
[0:48:07] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Can you/
[0:48:08] <%vaporousTippler> Is it just me or does that guy sound like a Khajiit?

[0:50:37] <natebud> Pat has a dumb charge shot upgrade on his pistol. It's an "illegal part"

[0:50:38] <%OwlLightningMage> What the fuck are these laser noises LUL
[0:50:40] <%rubert_jenkins> there's like a charge shot ability that causes the noise
[0:50:48] <Psych_man13_13> I fucking forgot about the laser sounds
[0:50:48] <JetpackMcQuack> Little rascals
[0:50:48] <+Skelegroove> Charge shot makes the handgun sound like a laser blaster
[0:50:51] <%tusk102> @OwlLightningMage CHARGE SHOT
[0:50:52] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> This gun has the Charge mod equipped which makes it sound Star Warsy
[0:50:52] <%SoFarFetched> makes me think of the star wars blaster noises at times.
[0:50:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> Illegal my ass
[0:51:00] <%SundanceShot> is the part illegal because it's from the future?

[0:51:23] <OToole42> no
[0:51:23] <%Typhaeon> You put it on the shelf
[0:51:24] <%twistedj3ster> No, it goes to the item box
[0:51:24] <%Laecerelius> It sits there
[0:51:25] <TheLoneWolf1601> No it goes to item box
[0:51:25] <%optimasmaximas> goes to ammo box
[0:51:26] <%Jekado> its left there
[0:51:26] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt yes
[0:51:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you can get it back at an item box
[0:51:27] <%mankeytennis> Charge mod pew pew

[0:51:34] <startstoprepeat> AEUG
[0:51:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> AUG
[0:51:35] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt it goes to the box
[0:51:36] <%D3rrtyD4n> dat ammo
[0:51:37] <FriendlyCheer> The shotgun feels weak impact wise compared to RE5's mega knockdown.
[0:51:40] <%Essixian> !uptime
[0:51:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yes
[0:51:40] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 51m 42s.
[0:51:42] <%radda343> delicious bullpup
[0:51:44] <natebud> You want that gun
[0:51:47] <IminyourBase> so much ammo!
[0:51:50] <OToole42> love the aug
[0:51:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ghost in the box
[0:51:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> CS flashbacks
[0:51:59] <%Dementedpenguin> RE4's shotgun felt great
[0:52:01] <%Mister_McDerp> augs are cool guns
[0:52:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you never want a shotgun to feel weak
[0:52:03] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @startstoprepeat I get that reference.
[0:52:06] <%Sir_stride> it's a tickle gun
[0:52:07] <Meekest> This game is kind of bad
[0:52:07] <sothatsprettybrutal> most powerful gun in the Earth Sphere
[0:52:11] <%Essixian> How far into the game is he?
[0:52:12] <%Tucker0603> I fucking love this gun
[0:52:16] <cochramd1992> it feels weak compared to Doom or DOOM, but that goes without saying
[0:52:18] <%D3rrtyD4n> yes
[0:52:19] <ScreamLord> So apparently in this new cartoon called Glitch Techs has a cameo of Matt and Patt with Jason from Heavy Rain and in the animatic you can also see Woolie and Liam
[0:52:21] <natebud> The enemies don't react to being shotguned a lot of the time
[0:52:21] <suikudo> tmp was ass
[0:52:22] <%Sir_stride> yeah
[0:52:22] <Aracon_> RE4 was given to us by god
[0:52:23] <%Essixian> Exit won' open.
[0:52:25] <Aydarkzero> Riot Gun is nice
[0:52:26] <%OwlLightningMage> A bad shotgun feels extra bad
[0:52:27] <jimmypurple> I absolutely adore bullpup
[0:52:27] <%happyface699> Re 3 shotgun is great
[0:52:28] <%Dementedpenguin> I need to replay that game again......
[0:52:31] <%tusk102> cuz re4 was gun porn esp that rifle and red9 reload @PatStaresAt
[0:52:32] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Essixian Chapter 5 I believe.
[0:52:47] <%Sir_stride> ok chat. which is better? RE4 or RE2 remake?
[0:52:48] <%Essixian> @King_Wolf_Rigger Out of...?
[0:52:51] <%GarbageQueenEllie> boo
[0:52:53] <%Neo_Kaiser> RE4

[0:52:58] <%the_vedo_show> atpUgly
[0:52:58] <+machshop> heat the keys
[0:52:58] <%OwlLightningMage> More shotguns should shoot explosive rounds
[0:52:58] <+trekkie11041> @suikudo its actually only ass in the gamecube version. they buffed it massively in all the others
[0:52:58] <cochramd1992> LUL
[0:52:59] <Psych_man13_13> So the thing is, I don’t remember the gun parts in rev 2 being dumb like this charge shot
[0:52:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> hahahahaha. Get it?
[0:53:00] <%happyface699> Re 4
[0:53:02] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Essixian No clue lol
[0:53:03] <ScreamLord> Bullpup is the superior rifle design
[0:53:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Do you get the fucking joke?
[0:53:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> change it again pat
[0:53:09] <OToole42> imagine the shock of playing RE6 without any exposure to good RE games, my wife only played 6 and assumed the whole series was trash
[0:53:10] <%Essixian> @King_Wolf_Rigger :P
[0:53:10] <Slimeking_Mike> Yuck
[0:53:11] <%Sir_stride> remake 2 has my money
[0:53:19] <%worldbrand> i had more fun in RE4 but i appreciated almost every part of RE2make
[0:53:19] <%D3rrtyD4n> re2 remake is more classic RE and less linear, so i prefer that
[0:53:22] <%Dementedpenguin> @OToole42 Yikes
[0:53:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @ScreamLord Man I wish. So many problems with bullpup designs.
[0:53:27] <%tusk102> @OToole42 FUCKING OOF
[0:53:28] <%Sir_stride> @otoole42 that hurt me on a atomic level
[0:53:29] <+Skelegroove> Remake2 was one of the best games I've ever played
[0:53:29] <CheekyBirb> time tog ear up Kappa
[0:53:36] <+meatxsteam> Hard call. I'd say remake just cause I like the police station setting better than weird forest and castle. It's all perspective really, they both feel great
[0:53:37] <%Essixian> @King_Wolf_Rigger Googled it. 12!
[0:53:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[0:53:46] <%Sir_stride> re2 remake is almost a perfect game

[0:53:49] <%mister_rogers> Is this one of the okay RE games
[0:53:49] <%Shadowpint> @OToole42 My first Metroid was Other M, so I can relate

[0:55:22] <%happyface699> @sir_stride If only the scenario system was more closely based on the original. I felt some of the fights were less special because you get to play them on both characters. Birkin anyway

[0:55:51] <%the_vedo_show> sounds like a blaster in star wars
[0:55:54] <Run44forrest> re6 is a "game"
[0:55:56] <KeiPrime> its not more than ass deep tho
[0:56:00] <%lutefiiisk> People who don't like RE like RE6
[0:56:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> btw, there's an illegal custom part in this area.
[0:56:06] <SpikeEffectSatanicSoldier> Star Wars sounds effect? In my resident evil? More common than you think
[0:56:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> They kinda look like the monster from Amnesia.
[0:56:09] <natebud> If anyone's ever played COD1, the pistol makes the mosin sniper rifle noise
[0:56:13] <BaneofGodz> @the_vedo_show I was just thinking the same thing.

[1:03:55] <%tusk102> @usurper_sos much like actual tessellated panels irl, when you move it stops working as well because the scales/panels can't react fast enough to copy their surroundings

[1:04:06] <%radda343> this fucking chuuni secret agent man with his dumb knives
[1:04:07] <%misterspotswood> i think this is where i said "fuck this game"
[1:04:08] <+lethallylactic> Did it just shrink into its own torso? LUL
[1:04:10] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt It occurs to me. Do all of these Ultra Viruses also give the victim an insanely boosted immunity system? Because with features like "a hole through the torso that does nothing" would leave them highly susceptible to other infections.
[1:04:11] <Solidnick18> just like the 3ds Kappa
[1:04:11] <CheekyBirb> this really blows

[1:04:28] <%Typhaeon> With hunters, apparently
[1:04:29] <%D3rrtyD4n> seems annoying
[1:04:31] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @patstaresat So this game is literally just Predator, huh?
[1:04:34] <iamnotaparrot> This music sucks and is used way too often.
[1:04:35] <%the_vedo_show> it's bad
[1:04:36] <gekizenbu> this blows, this blows
[1:04:38] <Run44forrest> he almost said it LUL
[1:04:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> its amazing
[1:04:39] <+Shockrates20XX> Is there any important lore in this game?
[1:04:40] <%Laecerelius> Would you say that this blows?
[1:04:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> this blows
[1:04:43] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @코코꾸라 But, that would blow.
[1:04:45] <%Mister_McDerp> would you says the mission blows?
[1:04:46] <gekizenbu> @Shockrates20XX it blows
[1:04:46] <%misterspotswood> gee billy, why do you get to fight two hunters?
[1:04:48] <natebud> There are no good cutaway missions in this game
[1:04:49] <%Ilpala> 2 WHOLE BULLETS
[1:04:49] <thelonechris> They knew

[1:04:51] <%happyface699> THis BLows

[1:08:35] <+Tornix> she needs the bare leg for....reasons
[1:08:35] <%Laecerelius> This lady is the dumbest
[1:08:35] <%CrookedSpiral> wtf

[1:08:36] <suikudo> wait what the fuck?
[1:08:36] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It's fine.
[1:08:37] <tiaramaki> JESSIE-KUH
[1:08:38] <%logoth_> She can only afford one pant leg
[1:08:38] <HealingMind> 300 people obviously would ruin the CLEAR HORROR ATMOSPHERE they have going on here.
[1:08:38] <%SaiyanShoto> Pretty sure Jessica is dressing like that to lure Chris LUL
[1:08:39] <ammobasket> It was half off
[1:08:39] <+DesertPenguin> so stupid
[1:08:39] <FriendlyCheer> For easy zombie biting
[1:08:39] <%peachy996> The devs were really REALLY horny
[1:08:39] <%baronblank> xD
[1:08:40] <+KingGoblodyte> What is this dumb bitch wearing?
[1:08:40] <Solidnick18> Kreygasm
[1:08:40] <%Clundy> If Pat is cat and Elmo is mouse, Who was phone?
[1:08:40] <cochramd1992> seriously what the fuck
[1:08:41] <Aydarkzero> thought the point of the diving suit was to keep you warm
[1:08:41] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That outfit makes her worse than the two chucklefucks.
[1:08:42] <%mMayrro> this is like MonHun armor male vs female versions LUL
[1:08:43] <natebud> Pat has never seen this level by the way. The reveal is going to be great PogChamp
[1:08:44] <%Ran196> One leg is expose so she could get infected
[1:08:44] <SkyPirateArcane> That's... The stupidest design I've ever seen
[1:08:44] <%consistentlylistless> Thank god this game got ported so we can bask in all the glorious ass
[1:08:45] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Standard Japanese combat gear.
[1:08:45] <%klholland92> Ok but why tho
[1:08:46] <taptapmuhgap> @PatStaresAt Because the others are still handling the mess at the acropolis tower lol
[1:08:47] <suikudo> Jessica dies doesnt she?
[1:08:49] <%baronblank> what the fuck is she wearing
[1:08:49] <iamnotaparrot> The reason small squads are sent to most real life quarantine areas with deadly viruses is to reduce risk of infectees
[1:08:51] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Is she trying to hitchhike in the 40s?
[1:08:52] <bsmusic> WutFace
[1:08:52] <%Agami23> wow thats anime as fuck
[1:08:53] <%happyface699> It’s super hot
[1:08:56] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt they aren't a PMC and don't have that many agents. Also, you're 50% through the game. 6 chapters left.
[1:08:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> search around
[1:08:57] <Divantae> welp they tried better stop at the locked door
[1:08:58] <TheLoneWolf1601> Because chris can punch boulders
[1:08:58] <+trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt theres actual reasons for the two man teams
[1:08:58] <natebud> Jessica's one white leg
[1:09:01] <%코코꾸라> Why is the music so dramatic?
[1:09:02] <Solidnick18> that will distract the monsters
[1:09:03] <CheekyBirb> Chris is also packing
[1:09:03] <%king_wragles> @Mister_McDerp cause then she'd get cold, DdDdUuUuHhHh
[1:09:05] <Dutchpotato> How the hell is jessica?

[1:09:06] <%Typhaeon> The evil Velcro terrorists
[1:09:08] <%Laecerelius> Gotta love how Chris is just wearing his usual outfit but this time it's waterproof
[1:09:08] <bsmusic> Too much horny in chat
[1:09:08] <oniwahoo> Why is this game so much worse than 2?
[1:09:13] <42nfl19> IS THIS THE ZAPPING SYSTEM?
[1:09:14] <%Typhaeon> Want to cover up the swimsuits
[1:09:14] <%mankeytennis> It's MonHun Gunner armor
[1:09:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lewd <3

[1:09:32] <%Sir_stride> Map?
[1:09:35] <primarch_lupercal> chris does not want to talk to jessica at all LUL
[1:09:36] <42nfl19> But I like shooters...
[1:09:37] <Aydarkzero> stubborn
[1:09:40] <+Shockrates20XX> Aren't they all kind of Mini RE4s?
[1:09:42] <%Tucker0603> Jessica has a fucking dumbass outfit, I fucking love it
[1:09:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> dummy pst
[1:09:44] <@commanderclaw> The 360 generation was one hell of a time
[1:09:45] <%GameOver_Here> But Gear was hot tho
[1:09:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Because it sold pat. It sould well in a bunch of places
[1:09:47] <%misterspotswood> why is her suit so sexy, like why the leg? jills makes sense, but this chicks? i love it
[1:09:51] <%optimasmaximas> @GameOver_Here 2004 helicopters were years ahead of their time
[1:09:51] <Run44forrest> BIG. FUCKING MAP
[1:09:52] <iamnotaparrot> lol
[1:09:53] <%Essixian> @tusk102 I would guess some kind of flotation device.
[1:09:53] <OldOnyx> I realized I would hate this character till the end of time when she showed up in that thing.
[1:09:54] <natebud> This is 60% a decent game.
[1:09:57] <Shonen_hero> because FPS shit was hot then
[1:09:57] <%Conyst> She's trying so fucking hard to seduce Chris.
[1:09:57] <%Ran196> you need all the shooters pat
[1:10:00] <majindusto> Japanese Stubbornness
[1:10:00] <%Kegeto> Why do they have those travel pillow
[1:10:01] <%Mister_McDerp> too many shooters
[1:10:01] <thelonechris> Wouldn't the exposed leg make her more susceptible to being infected
[1:10:04] <Frade> Duck Hunt when? Keepo
[1:10:05] <%SoaringLettuce> optimal warmth, like sleeping with a leg outside of the bed covers
[1:10:05] <FriendlyCheer> Resident Evil 8" Battle Royale
[1:10:07] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I hate her suit
[1:10:08] <iamnotaparrot> hooter shooters
[1:10:08] <garidoskill> tbh we could use more punches
[1:10:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah this game is decent....just decent tho.
[1:10:09] <CheekyBirb> to be fair, japanese didn't have many shooters back then
[1:10:10] <+trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt i hope you like this music
[1:10:11] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Because of the Call of Duty money, Pat
[1:10:12] <uncledoodsauce> not a hero atleast was enjoyable and a good throwback to action RE
[1:10:13] <+Andu_in> Sonic: Gotta quarantine fast
[1:10:15] <%SoFarFetched> DID YOU THOUGH
[1:10:16] <Aydarkzero> a lot of people forget the ps3/360 ear was really janky
[1:10:16] <KeiPrime> jessica is tryin to continue the redfield bloodline, to no avail

[1:28:43] <%king_wragles> FUN FACT: most modern guns are actually able to fire after being submerged. The degree at which they perform varies, but almost no gun will fail immediately after these days.
[1:28:43] <+DesertPenguin> PULL!
[1:28:44] <natebud> i wonder if you can pick these guys up with the scanner in the water

[1:33:56] <%MrBorisMakarov> jills areas eh
[1:33:58] <%Laecerelius> Man once you get that keycard you have so many fucking areas to go back to
[1:34:00] <%rytyoung> I keep thinking Parker is Carlos from re 3
[1:34:00] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Ah, so the RE games are just a series of Quantum Sex. It only exists if the characters aren't onscreen
[1:34:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yup
[1:34:01] <%peachy996> @ZeOrbling I thought I heard the Basement Squeal from SH2 but I can't be sure
[1:34:02] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @DesertPenguin It only gets more insane.
[1:34:03] <%spiritofmojave> Areas is that what they call Jill's assets
[1:34:04] <+DesertPenguin> Her ass is reflecting the light
[1:34:04] <usurper_sos> Yeah her areas
[1:34:06] <%D3rrtyD4n> HahaThink wrong ship
[1:34:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and that's why the custom part wasn't there either

[1:34:13] <Shonen_hero> Jill makes me hot under the collar
[1:34:18] <+DesertPenguin> What's the Revlaiton joke?
[1:34:20] <yourliteraldog> Her as is a light source
[1:34:23] <%Dementedpenguin> @DesertPenguin part 3 feels a big disjointed overall. Apparently the author decided to play it by ear (reactions) with this part
[1:34:26] <%peachy996> Wait you couldn't look at the name on the boat?
[1:34:27] <%Typhaeon> There's a third boat named the Queen Quasiramus, little do they know
[1:34:30] <Aydarkzero> of course...
[1:34:31] <%D3rrtyD4n> duh
[1:34:40] <natebud> I've got jackass on it
[1:34:41] <%peachy996> You could have looked at the name while you were in the air Chris
[1:34:42] <%mMayrro> @DesertPenguin Capcom misspelled the game's name when it launched
[1:34:43] <usurper_sos> TOP MEN
[1:34:44] <%D3rrtyD4n> they dont need you anymore chris
[1:34:44] <+DesertPenguin> @Dementedpenguin Hello fellow penguin. I enjoyed the first two for having so many stupid classic rock references
[1:34:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Typhaeon There actually IS a third ship, but it's sunken.
[1:34:46] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Or maybe.... Shrodinger's Puss?
[1:34:49] <%rytyoung> Isn't that the bad Janitor dude from dead rising 2?
[1:34:50] <%MrBorisMakarov> ???
[1:34:52] <cochramd1992> @GarbageQueenEllie correct, one day Leon might plow Claire's fertile pussy, but never onscreen
[1:34:52] <%SoFarFetched> they were like "FUCK THIS SHIP"
[1:34:55] <%MajorCrasher> @typhaeon YOU JOKE. BUT....
[1:34:55] <+DesertPenguin> Like, mispelled everywhere?

[1:35:07] <FriendlyCheer> So why did that one also have monsters on it?
[1:35:07] <%Typhaeon> Nah that's the Queen Demiramus
[1:35:07] <+DesertPenguin> Oh, I'm Tom Petty. Like wtf?!
[1:35:07] <Hellarussian> nothing
[1:35:08] <%misterspotswood> they're not going to address this boat ALSO WITH MONSTERS?
[1:35:08] <cochramd1992> nuke it
[1:35:10] <natebud> Let the BSAA jobbers clean up that ship
[1:35:12] <%Mister_McDerp> that ship is someone else's problem
[1:35:14] <majindusto> THEY JUST LEAVE? LOL
[1:35:14] <%baronblank> wait how would they have screwed up, shouldn't they know where jill and parker are since they're the ones who sent them on the mission?

[1:35:19] <%Ran196> fuck that BOW Ship, we want the one with Jill

[1:35:32] <%misterspotswood> @D3rrtyD4n theres hardly one to follow
[1:35:36] <%baronblank> honestly my assumption is that leader man is evil
[1:35:37] <%rytyoung> @d3rrtyd4n just focus on the boat it's all about the boat
[1:35:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> *problem
[1:35:40] <+trekkie11041> being part of the BSAA SOU seems like a death sentence
[1:35:41] <%tusk102> @D3rrtyD4n jill and parker trapped on ship, everyone else looking for them. aka the most basic bitch shit
[1:35:48] <%Typhaeon> And the King Harold Ramis is the mysterioso fifth ship

[1:38:50] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I like Jill butt
[1:38:51] <cochramd1992> you made her ass extra large, let us stare at it
[1:38:51] <%rytisone> uh, you pervert
[1:38:53] <WaxWitch> butts are banned
[1:38:53] <+the_drummaestro> too big it stops the camera from moving
[1:38:53] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You have to buy DLC to get a proper look at Jill Ass
[1:38:54] <%Mister_McDerp> only allowed to see half a butt
[1:38:54] <Talhee> Getting Shadman Flashbacks
[1:38:56] <natebud> "games are scarier when you can't see your butt" - Shinji Mikami

[1:39:12] <%xUmbraNinja> No tyme
[1:39:13] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt she learned from leon in re4 apparently
[1:39:14] <%Huntercd> Her Pirate costume tho
[1:39:14] <%Laecerelius> She's a big girl who makes big jumps
[1:39:15] <evbites> how is she doing that
[1:39:16] <Dragovus> She must ruin her knees
[1:39:17] <+corrosivePaladin> only cowards use ladders
[1:39:17] <Run44forrest> shut up its cool
[1:39:17] <oniwahoo> We enlarged her ass, but moved the camera during the ladder climb so that you couldn't see it, you perverts!
[1:39:17] <%SoFarFetched> no she needs to show off her ASSets
[1:39:18] <%Essixian> @Talhee He's the hero we... have.
[1:39:19] <natebud> She just does the Leon jump
[1:39:19] <%optimasmaximas> @Lizard0TM i really enjoyed it; it's really different from the rest of the series setting wise so i thought it was alright
[1:39:22] <%Typhaeon> Uncooked sea chicken
[1:39:24] <%peachy996> And this is Pre-RE5 Super Jill?
[1:39:24] <%spiritofmojave> Jill loves jumps
[1:39:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> don't look up
[1:39:29] <%mMayrro> BURN KNUCKLE
[1:39:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Barnacles are herpes for boats
[1:39:35] <TurtlesAndTentacles> people voted for RE6 lol
[1:39:36] <yourliteraldog> Burn Nickle
[1:39:38] <iamnotaparrot> those were added to the console ports
[1:39:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yay boat herpes
[1:39:39] <%Strange_Bot> Leon still has the most insane jump height in RE4
[1:39:40] <Talhee> @Essixian Hero's a bit of a stretch.
[1:39:40] <%xUmbraNinja> Jill vs ladder
[1:39:43] <%SWFanatic> Jill the master of osteoarthritis
[1:39:44] <ha2ken> Snake eater ladders
[1:39:46] <%Laecerelius> Yeah this is before RE5
[1:39:50] <%Emperor_Machinus> She is showing off the results her squat regimen
[1:39:53] <%Huntercd> Nuke the ocean
[1:39:53] <Run44forrest> shut up its cool and we didnt program going down a ladder
[1:39:53] <FriendlyCheer> Play Pazakk
[1:39:56] <iamnotaparrot> the wall blisters weren't in the 3DS version
[1:39:56] <%Kegeto> She needs her leg work out
[1:39:56] <%Laecerelius> Oh
[1:39:57] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @peachy996 Yeah. She was super stronk, and that's how she suplexes Wesker.
[1:39:57] <WaxWitch> yeah, y'all are fucked up LUL
[1:39:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> good for shotgun
[1:40:00] <natebud> i think that's collaterals?
[1:40:01] <%Laecerelius> Might be good for shotty
[1:40:06] <oniwahoo> Jill the Master of getting carried by Barry
[1:40:07] <+IMCthulhu> stuns better, i think
[1:40:07] <%tusk102> make them cease moving good for shotty @PatStaresAt
[1:40:11] <+trekkie11041> thats good for shotty
[1:40:16] <%Essixian> @Talhee He's something.
[1:40:16] <majindusto> Jill is not Normal People...RE3 fucked her up
[1:40:20] <xeros720> bind helps stagger chance, i think
[1:40:20] <%peachy996> No wonder Wesker keeps her instead of killing her then
[1:40:26] <%SWFanatic> shits locked
[1:40:27] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Casino Bitches is the name of my mumble rap album.
[1:40:29] <%senorpapel> Oh wait this is jill, is it just me or does she look like drastically different each game?
[1:40:32] <%SWFanatic> won't budge
[1:40:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> that and Jill's been infected with so much shit at this point...she might as well be superhuman
[1:40:45] <%tusk102> @senorpapel it's not just you, pats mentioned it a bunch
[1:40:46] <cochramd1992> that's fucked up
[1:40:46] <%peachy996> Nah Jill is super different all the time
[1:40:50] <+Plankman> that's messed up
[1:40:52] <%MelBrooksKA> All the characters do @senorpapel
[1:40:53] <yourliteraldog> Thats cool
[1:40:56] <WaxWitch> the worst kind
[1:40:56] <%Mister_McDerp> that sucks
[1:40:57] <ha2ken> It won't open. Time to gamble I guess.
[1:40:57] <redrins> but then they try to bite your dick off
[1:40:59] <%spiritofmojave> @senorpapel think RE5 was the biggest leap but yeah she's super all over the place
[1:40:59] <%Mr_Strut> G kind of does that for a while
[1:40:59] <Monkeyweed21> Wesker looks at Jill doing this and gets his bimbofication fetish awakened
[1:40:59] <Dutchpotato> Yeah they constantly change Jill’s design
[1:41:00] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Captain Janeway would shoot them without hesitation
[1:41:01] <natebud> daze is stun, I think stopping power lets you shoot through enemies for more damage
[1:41:02] <%Maids4lyfe> that's fucking horrifying
[1:41:07] <%optimasmaximas> oh yeah this LUL
[1:41:07] <oniwahoo> @senorpapel She absolutely does, it's like they can't decide on her design
[1:41:08] <majindusto> *specifically the Events of RE3 fucked her up
[1:41:08] <%rytisone> please don't kill while I saw you
[1:41:08] <%Strange_Bot> RE:R was honestly one of the most scary virus strains
[1:41:10] <%SirGO0SE> Don't kill me, but man you look tasty
[1:41:11] <LixFury> Sounds like an imortality project gone wrong
[1:41:16] <+trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt that only happens when your resistent to the virus
[1:41:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> basically shoot it's soft parts
[1:41:28] <%Essixian> I HATE THESE THINGS
[1:41:30] <%KeystoneA1> Rachel cries about being a goo monster lady and begs you to help her
[1:41:31] <+Plankman> imagine having a glass elevator safe
[1:41:32] <yourliteraldog> They should make more of that that would make a very unsettling game to say the least
[1:41:32] <%Essixian> I HATE THEM
[1:41:32] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie Captain Janeway was practically evil lol.
[1:41:36] <%SoFarFetched> SONUVABISH

[1:41:40] <+Pookiedaexzile> Dsmn Jill what you doing double caked up on a family stream
[1:41:41] <%Strange_Bot> Not only is the fish imagery really fucked up, but the idea that people are fully aware of what's happening to them but are powerless against it is pure nightmare fuel.
[1:41:42] <WaxWitch> they be all like please help! then bite you... fuck
[1:41:42] <%Laecerelius> Gotta love how he's yelling and not shooting
[1:41:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Just jump out, you made a bigger jump before

[1:42:48] <%SirGO0SE> is this the Resident Evil game with the most varied enemy types? you'd think that being a 3ds game theyd want to reuse as many assets as possible, but everythings fresh
[1:42:48] <%juxtest> What is it doing on top of the elevator
[1:42:49] <%Essixian> @r90thunder I know right yogS

[1:45:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie 2 was the start of the decline for me. Lots of stuff felt like it got glossed over for not a measurable increase in playability.

[1:46:02] <%adventurerjess> WTF
[1:46:03] <%SWFanatic> its a brand new dance thats sweeping the nation, the resident evil shuffle
[1:46:11] <%JJCheeker> So you would be trapped forever in something you can't control
[1:46:14] <%Laecerelius> Whlp
[1:46:15] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Did you know that Hermit Crabs have HUGE dicks proportional to their size?
[1:46:17] <%Terrabyte_The_Terrible> This is such a boring looking boss battle arena, it's just a half circle with some stands
[1:46:18] <%adventurerjess> fucking japan and their gross shit
[1:46:27] <ha2ken> Do combo
[1:46:27] <%Strange_Bot> Not gonna lie, RE6 is a fun action game. If you know how the systems work it's fun as shit, it's just that the story is horrible and it's not survival horror whatsoever.
[1:46:30] <%senorpapel> Question for twitch peeps, when you see the share your sub option. Is the depleting bar underneath of it a timer?
[1:46:36] <%Laecerelius> Pat
[1:46:37] <%Essixian> @JJCheeker The soul would still be human unless magic is involved, so yeah.
[1:46:37] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @King_Wolf_Rigger It feels much more linear, but I personally like it. Lair of the Shadowbroker's my favorite
[1:46:40] <FriendlyCheer> Make it charge out the window and into the ocean
[1:46:46] <natebud> Am I wrong chat, can't you have the magnum by now?
[1:46:48] <%dustingunn> @Terrabyte_The_Terrible it's great considering the 3DS has like 5 bits of RAM
[1:46:56] <DashXero> @JJCheeker Yes. Theoretically.
[1:46:58] <%optimasmaximas> @senorpapel yeah
[1:47:02] <yourliteraldog> You can have a magnum dong
[1:47:05] <%senorpapel> Ahh
[1:47:06] <%Essixian> @JJCheeker Unless we're in a setting where the soul IS defined by (and therefore mutable by) DNA, which is an interesting concept. :O
[1:47:09] <%SirGO0SE> you can push it off @senorpapel
[1:47:12] <+lilunlovely> pat my head hurts
[1:47:12] <%adventurerjess> got like pimply blackheads
[1:47:21] <%YakumoYomi> Stonefist Daimyo Hermitaur
[1:47:24] <+trekkie11041> @natebud no its in one of those keycard safes i think
[1:47:24] <Talhee> Quick shoot the goo for Massive Damage.
[1:47:25] <%Laecerelius> So Pat could be super charge shotting this thing with a magnum? Maaan
[1:47:28] <evbites> thats a darksouls monster
[1:47:28] <Solidnick18> finally
[1:47:29] <%peachy996> Was it intentional for Parker and Jessica to be this useless?
[1:47:29] <%SoFarFetched> @senorpapel it's just a reminder thing,it will remind you later about your sub thing. You can always pin it.
[1:47:30] <%chhdez> So basically DNA coded fursonas?
[1:47:30] <Aracon_> LOL
[1:47:30] <cochramd1992> GROSS
[1:47:31] <+Plankman> @Essixian get sent to hell because the t-virus infected your soul with sin

[1:47:32] <DashXero> @JJCheeker It already happens to people who lose higher function. Or folks who for one reason or another can't control their bodies.
[1:47:33] <Aracon_> NICE
[1:47:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yup

[1:47:38] <%Laecerelius> MAGIC LADDER!
[1:47:39] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt this is a genuinely gross and neat design instead of "goop monster man"
[1:47:39] <%peachy996> Considering what happens to them later?
[1:47:41] <FriendlyCheer> Those pounds loosened
[1:47:42] <%mMayrro> piss of sheet
[1:47:47] <natebud> @trekkie11041 I know it just in a room on a desk somewhere
[1:47:51] <+thackattack00> Ladder soul-linked to the monster
[1:47:53] <%Typhaeon> Antenna singular
[1:47:55] <ha2ken> It shook the ladder down in its death throes.
[1:47:58] <%spiritofmojave> Where do these ladders materialize from
[1:47:59] <%SWFanatic> whats that smell?
[1:48:00] <%Laecerelius> Yeah!
[1:48:00] <oniwahoo> @jjcheeker Perhaps your soul would reject your new body and just sort of shut you down or something
[1:48:01] <suikudo> Sounded like paige for a second
[1:48:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and now you can get all the safes, Pat.
[1:48:05] <%JJCheeker> I don't know I was just asking hypothetical
[1:48:05] <+wvuboii> actually a pretty cool monster design
[1:48:11] <Jolnir> experience: i made all the fish people for resident evil on the nintendo
[1:48:15] <%Laecerelius> Time to go around the ship and open those safes and doors
[1:48:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Pretty sure there's a magnum somewhere.
[1:48:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie Yeah, there are some GREAT stories told in that game. I just felt super disappointed in the lack of RPG stuff. And man, when you see your new ship, it just gets you pumped up.
[1:48:26] <%senorpapel> @sofarfetched ahh, was wondering cuz it ran out while i was typing my sub message. So i assumed it never counted as sub message

[1:53:41] <+DesertPenguin> IT WAS ME BARRY!! IT WAS ME ALL ALONG!!
[1:53:42] <%Strange_Bot> So the solar energy matrix was able to just become a huge laser in the first place? That'd be like being able to turn the Hoover Dam into an Ion Cannon.
[1:53:42] <+IxDomxI> are you suspicious? i thought you were pat.
[1:53:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> @friendlycheer You know those space-weapon treaties don't exist

[1:54:08] <@commanderclaw> They have my wife!
[1:54:10] <%Typhaeon> The timing on that load screen got me
[1:54:11] <%Essixian> @FriendlyCheer Impossible to retrieve and expensive to destroy, plus the latter would result in disastrously huge amount of space junk that would destroy satellites and mess up rocket launches.
[1:54:13] <majindusto> SHEEV PALPATINE
[1:54:13] <%xUmbraNinja> 12 chapters
[1:54:15] <%SWFanatic> Previously on Resident Evil Revelayatons: Nonsensical plot exposition

[1:54:31] <%GameOver_Here> How far till the end
[1:54:34] <Deadbulky> Chris punches his way into summer slam
[1:54:35] <%GarbageQueenEllie> So what, just leave them to die?!
[1:54:35] <santafer> that was less dramatic than i hoped
[1:54:41] <%chhdez> *So far
[1:54:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> No :)
[1:54:42] <%Mister_McDerp> no

[1:55:14] <%Ranryu692> monster gone
[1:55:17] <%spiritofmojave> Jill and Chris could swim tf out no problem, Carter is a bitch tho
[1:55:17] <santafer> just shoot the satellite with an rpg!
[1:55:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Tfw even the piece of shit comic relief character is more useful than Parker
[1:55:19] <%SirGO0SE> got em
[1:55:20] <Deadbulky> Nah
[1:55:21] <%Lizard0TM> that voice does not match the face
[1:55:21] <rolpunk> Has @PatStaresAt not played this before?
[1:55:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt the seas would be BOILING if they did it
[1:55:26] <Monkeyweed21> pat pick up the ammo
[1:55:26] <%lionmanguy> Just PUNCH the laser
[1:55:27] <%spiritofmojave> Parker, whatever
[1:55:28] <ammobasket> only way to beat a punch is with a BIGGER punch!
[1:55:30] <s1rcuit> it's hard to insult someone who's callsign is JACKASS
[1:55:31] <Dragovus> Just go use your new key card Pat
[1:55:32] <%JJCheeker> Why cant Jill use her butt as a life preserver
[1:55:33] <%tusk102> doubt
[1:55:33] <natebud> They'd also need a rowboat
[1:55:34] <%xUmbraNinja> He’s never beat it
[1:55:34] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> The YAMATO 2 could blast that satellite out of the sky!
[1:55:39] <%Jekado> if chris rowed
[1:55:39] <%Laecerelius> Yeah go use keycard for stuffs!
[1:55:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @rolpunk he quit after the second Jackass bit.
[1:55:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt they would get sucked in
[1:55:45] <TurtlesAndTentacles> no Pat
[1:55:46] <%SWFanatic> the yamato 2 is just a myth

[1:56:27] <%Typhaeon> How the fuck does chaff work against LIGHT
[1:56:28] <evbites> where did this ship come from
[1:56:29] <majindusto> CHAFF
[1:56:29] <detritus25> Hey Fuckface. How's your crazy talk Canadian time going?
[1:56:31] <%Jekado> thats not how satalites work
[1:56:32] <natebud> they do
[1:56:33] <%XeroSigmaPrime> HOW DOES CHAFF STOP LIGHT
[1:56:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yes they do
[1:56:39] <%SWFanatic> shits locked
[1:56:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @knavethefish There's worse, I suppose

[1:56:42] <Deadbulky> LUL
[1:56:44] <%optimasmaximas> @PatStaresAt YES THEY DO
[1:56:48] <%XeroSigmaPrime> HOW DOES CHAFF DISRUPT A SATELLITE
[1:56:49] <shinichizio> Is it chaff or is it a disco ball?
[1:56:53] <%MajorCrasher> this map sucks
[1:56:53] <%xUmbraNinja> Shits locked
[1:56:56] <+trekkie11041> YES THEY DO PAT
[1:56:56] <+ledgefiendd> you passed foredeck
[1:56:56] <%Ranryu692> what about the poop deck?
[1:56:56] <natebud> See that gray square? keycard
[1:56:57] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> The foredeck is at the fore.
[1:57:03] <DashXero> @XeroSigmaPrime Distracts the targeting system somehow?
[1:57:04] <%Essixian> @XeroSigmaPrime It won't, it's supposed to trick the satellite into targeting it instead of the ship
[1:57:04] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Why not just use an empty crate and paddle like hell?
[1:57:08] <$Bearjewpiter> psaSkelmo I have become skeleton psaSkelmo
[1:57:10] <%JJCheeker> "' every night in my dreams I see you..."
[1:57:10] <+Skelegroove> Just put a bunch of mirrors on top of the ship
[1:57:10] <%spiritofmojave> Space chaff LUL
[1:57:14] <oniwahoo> @xerosigmaprime The chaff goes all the way into space >.>
[1:57:17] <%Conyst> Did Conan die, or is he still on board?
[1:57:18] <+trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt theres no time limit so go clean up
[1:57:22] <Aydarkzero> things are happening
[1:57:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> This game is kind of a Castletroid, huh?
[1:57:24] <Monkeyweed21> what about the ginger?
[1:57:24] <detritus25> Oh I see our ginger goblin is B I G L O S T.
[1:57:25] <+RedKazoo> drama music
[1:57:25] <%Typhaeon> Also that must be metal panels about a mile wide each if it's chaff that can be seen from space...?
[1:57:35] <%Laecerelius> isn't the freight elevator nearby?
[1:57:36] <%optimasmaximas> no
[1:57:38] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> you know what else is drama? repopped enemy spawns :D
[1:57:42] <natebud> I think you're missing one key
[1:57:45] <%optimasmaximas> but most
[1:57:45] <+trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt no you dont have the trident key
[1:57:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I think SOME doors won't let you open them cuz "URGENCY"
[1:57:47] <%SWFanatic> hes eating him, then hes going to eat me! O M G
[1:57:48] <%MajorCrasher> no that's later
[1:57:49] <%KeystoneA1> just keycard coors
[1:57:57] <CheekyBirb> nice loading screen
[1:57:58] <Aydarkzero> look at that loading screen
[1:58:01] <detritus25> This is on a boat also right? Ho hasn't it sunk with all the monstars.
[1:58:09] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Essixian Except you know, jets and planes have systems that easily circumvent chaff for nearly 20 years.
[1:58:10] <oniwahoo> Trolls comments? WOW
[1:58:12] <+Skelegroove> There was no point in having buddies in this game
[1:58:15] <%krawtch> "don't help me, Parker! I have no idea where to go!"
[1:58:17] <yourliteraldog> Its a satellite that dose not use an camera for its targeting system. Why the fuck did they cheap out on that.
[1:58:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> pretty sure that's later
[1:58:21] <%optimasmaximas> yeah
[1:58:22] <%SoFarFetched> yes
[1:58:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> but yeah
[1:58:27] <theKingRamses> do it
[1:58:27] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> It's got water I bet
[1:58:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> les try
[1:58:28] <Dragovus> No timer on screen means infinite time Parker
[1:58:29] <natebud> go there last
[1:58:35] <+trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt you can get it
[1:58:48] <%Essixian> @XeroSigmaPrime Oh yeah, it's still dumb. But it's not -quite- as dumb as just BLOCKING a giant space laser.
[1:58:57] <yourliteraldog> What if there is a secret timer
[1:58:57] <korth367> go there now
[1:59:05] <MrDonTacos_> just follow your heart
[1:59:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you'll know if there's a timer or not
[1:59:13] <%Laecerelius> Conan, stop being such a tool
[1:59:13] <%SWFanatic> I'll T pose here

[1:59:29] <%optimasmaximas> no go now, itll take longer to go get the others then run back to get those and then go back to the deck is a waste of time
[1:59:33] <uncledoodsauce> ja rule
[1:59:34] <oniwahoo> That dude screams evil
[1:59:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you're not quite done with this ship yet

[1:59:38] <karl_rex> what a loading screen
[1:59:38] <HeavyManaBeast2> feels evil
[1:59:40] <detritus25> Oh yeah I forgot that happened in RE5. Nothing like nuking a problem from orbit.

[2:03:56] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @AMaidIndeed Actually, back in the day Port used to be called Larbourd so it's not just a FFXIV reference. After awhile, people realized that it could get confusing under duress or in bad weather so it was changed.

[2:05:30] <eyedntcry> these monster designs fucking suck
[2:05:34] <DRAGKUDO> is he playing on the hardest difficulty?
[2:05:40] <AMaidIndeed> @King_Wolf_Rigger Oh I know.. the whole raid tier we got -well- acqquainted with it and that exact problem would mess us up during prog. Meanwhile damn JP got to read "Left" and "right"... but I'm not bitter >:T

[2:06:10] <Dragovus> Pat is on a rampage
[2:06:15] <+MoonObscure> where? Kappa
[2:06:16] <%Laecerelius> Could the UAV be on the foredeck?
[2:06:16] <%dustingunn> @DRAGKUDO definitely not. it's not really possible outside of NG+
[2:06:17] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Hurry Pat. The UAV is on the foredeck.
[2:06:21] <%Typhaeon> Parker, we're a little occupied with the aftdeck if you know what I mean
[2:06:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> But are you aware that the Foredeck is where they have the UAV?
[2:06:22] <majindusto> PAT MAD

[2:11:50] <DRAGKUDO> they have the same amount of variants tho
[2:11:50] <yourliteraldog> Bust shot
[2:11:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I think there might be a later one that can be used for Magnum?
[2:11:57] <%chhdez> MinMaxing intensifies
[2:11:58] <%dustingunn> but he only has 1 shell
[2:11:59] <%tusk102> you need charge shot 2
[2:11:59] <yourliteraldog> Aw sadness
[2:12:00] <%Kegeto> That dumb
[2:12:00] <+Karebuncle> Charge 1 is pistol, Charge 2 is shotgun, and i think charge 3 is either magnum or rifle
[2:12:00] <detritus25> This games broken.
[2:12:09] <+trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt theres a different charge shot that goes on the magnum
[2:12:13] <HeavyManaBeast2> i know one is for shotty
[2:12:16] <redrins> yeah I think there were several charge shots
[2:12:19] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> HOW does a revolver get a longer mag?
[2:12:23] <swisscheeze47> Yo yo yo
[2:12:23] <%dustingunn> charge 5 is magnum

[2:12:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Folded space
[2:12:43] <+corrosivePaladin> It gets a longer cylinder of course
[2:12:44] <HeavyManaBeast2> magic
[2:12:45] <%krawtch> how much better would the upgrading be if you could upgrade weapon stats like RE4 but each weapon had 1 slot for a special mod like burst or charge
[2:12:46] <tigerfang86> Obviously you tape more cylinders on
[2:12:46] <+Karebuncle> @King_Wolf_Rigger you trade out teh cylinder for a chain
[2:12:47] <%CptVolkow> Bioshock had long magazine revolvers
[2:12:47] <tigerfang86> OBVIOUSLY
[2:12:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> One of the money, Two for the show, Three Round Burst baby! GO GO GO!

[2:13:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> wasn't there another safe right before where he needs to go?
[2:13:59] <+Skelegroove> Jill is going to jail for like a billion years for all those illegal parts
[2:14:00] <%Laecerelius> The UAV is on the other boat the entire time!
[2:14:01] <+DesertPenguin> Sweet, I love random rare firearms

[2:15:03] <%Corporate_Redeemer> LEON PLEASE IMPREGNATE MY SISTER IN THE UAV THAT'S ON THE FOREDECK
[2:15:05] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> To be fair, there are revolvers like the Raging Hornet that hold eight or so, but you can't just throw in a bigger cylinder into a revolver. Shit needs tooling.

[2:35:40] <Marpolo13> it's FIIIIIIINNNNNEEEEE
[2:35:41] <Zombrocom> How the helll does chaff retarget a space death laser
[2:35:41] <s1rcuit> Boiling hot Tidal Wave? What could go wrong?
[2:35:41] <Rishnix> A row boat would have surely been fine.
[2:35:43] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Valentinius_Anodyne To fuck with the lock-on system, but yeah it doesn't make too much sense.
[2:35:44] <Mr__Volk> Yup, that would still be a forever nap
[2:35:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> Inverted castle
[2:35:46] <%Ran196> the boat flip, just like in that movie
[2:35:46] <Aracon_> just hide under a desk
[2:35:47] <%XeroSigmaPrime> WHY DID SUNLIGHT CREATE THAT WAVE
[2:35:47] <%Neo_Kaiser> Why didn't they get on the UAV and fly away?
[2:35:47] <%DensityD> nwf
[2:35:49] <capnkrispy> they are on a different ship though
[2:35:49] <%GraceTBM> to be fair that would fuck up a rowboat pretty bad
[2:35:52] <+DesertPenguin> its fiiiiiine
[2:35:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> sba
[2:36:00] <+mans51> does he have that bond movie laser?

[2:36:05] <%xUmbraNinja> You’re getting there pat
[2:36:05] <%the_vedo_show> atpCap atpCap
[2:36:05] <%GraceTBM> xero rapid changes in temperature
[2:36:06] <%rytisone> you would not survive that wave with a rowboat
[2:36:07] <%chhdez> It's just water, guys, grab a towel
[2:36:07] <%peachy996> Unmanned Air Vehicle
[2:36:10] <startstoprepeat> rachel's in the rowboat
[2:36:11] <Monkeyweed21> wouldnt they boil alive
[2:36:13] <+razielhex> oh you silly Penguin
[2:36:14] <DashXero> At least you'll die after a good arm and chest workout.
[2:36:15] <LustrousEudemon> giant wave coming ROW FASTER benny hill theme
[2:36:16] <%Kegeto> Or swim
[2:36:16] <%krawtch> aw but muh recaps
[2:36:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> @XeroSigmaPrime a ton of water was near instantanously vaperized....
[2:36:19] <%SWFanatic> Kenny loves that boat
[2:36:21] <zayasu> cirHuh
[2:36:21] <%spiritofmojave> just PUNCH the water behind you to propel yourself
[2:36:21] <%ShichiNoBushi> I heard it as "robo it".
[2:36:22] <Arek_1> LUL
[2:36:24] <%consistentlylistless> Get in the rowboat and do the resident evil spin
[2:36:24] <%SWFanatic> something fierce
[2:36:24] <CrypticMochi> Get sponge to soak it up
[2:36:25] <detritus25> psaGoblin
[2:36:25] <yourliteraldog> Well Photons do carry some momentum.
[2:36:26] <%chhdez> MAh Boat
[2:36:26] <DazedCookies> Is this better than ORC?
[2:36:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> is that from a boomer movie?
[2:36:27] <%Corporate_Redeemer> @neo_kaiser UAV stands for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. It doesn't fit people
[2:36:28] <%Neo_Kaiser> One person rows, the other kicks their legs.
[2:36:31] <%fairore> oh you beat it
[2:36:35] <%senorpapel> Rowboat bad, but now what if surfboard?
[2:36:38] <%xUmbraNinja> Last chapter tonight?
[2:36:43] <Marpolo13> then why didn't he just hit the boat directly
[2:36:44] <DRAGKUDO> real talk tho this game has the coolest final boss
[2:36:45] <%SoFarFetched> @fairore no note beaten yet. Last chapter is chapter 12.
[2:36:46] <Monkeyweed21> A HUMANIST AS OPPOSED TO WHAT

[2:36:46] <%goose_attack_almanac> O'BRIAN RUES
[2:36:46] <%chhdez> Nice beard
[2:36:47] <+Skelegroove> I dunno these bioweapons are all stopped by a couple people with guns
[2:36:49] <%Mister_McDerp> no cause and a lost cause?
[2:36:50] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> His no cause is a lost cause?
[2:36:50] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @doc_ock_rokc Would that cause a whirlpool? Not a giant wave?
[2:36:51] <Run44forrest> D:
[2:36:54] <natebud> sick burned
[2:36:54] <%peachy996> What is this exchange?
[2:36:55] <bart_bagot> WOW
[2:36:58] <Run44forrest> D: he said a no no
[2:36:58] <%SirGO0SE> Kenny is the secret boss of this game
[2:37:02] <%peachy996> What is this dialogue
[2:37:04] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @doc_ock_rokc Plus the amount of steam
[2:37:06] <%croxeye> what amazing dialogue
[2:37:07] <RC_S3kshun8> Holy shit was that DC Douglas too?

[2:37:28] <Marpolo13> the OCEAN
[2:37:28] <%peachy996> That whole conversation was like 2 Sasuke's talking
[2:37:30] <%SoFarFetched> Pat can probably get that weapon part now.
[2:37:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> This dialogue presented to by: The people who made Daemon X Machina
[2:37:31] <Deadbulky> ?????
[2:37:32] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @doc_ock_rokc Yea but is also rises
[2:37:33] <Aydarkzero> the basement!
[2:37:35] <tigerfang86> SHUT UP THO
[2:37:35] <%Calek> are they under water
[2:37:35] <%krawtch> just build a helicopter you nerds
[2:37:35] <Aracon_> WHERE ARE YOU GONNA GO
[2:37:36] <Marpolo13> DED
[2:37:37] <FriendlyCheer> dead
[2:37:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The lifeboats :)
[2:37:37] <%DensityD> Gold Experience Requiem
[2:37:38] <Deadbulky> DED
[2:37:40] <suikudo> thats death right there
[2:37:40] <DazedCookies> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:37:41] <%GraceTBM> that was DRAMATICALLY too gentle, considering the thing fucking flipped over
[2:37:43] <%Maids4lyfe> that should have killed them
[2:37:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> NOW you can get the custom parts, Pat.
[2:37:45] <%Calek> I'm gonna take a big ol yes on that one
[2:37:47] <%lionandfox21> They should be dead
[2:37:48] <Deadbulky> Just give up LUL
[2:37:48] <tigerfang86> DIRE DIRE DOCKS
[2:37:49] <youlookokgetin> Parker i just had an idea! Lets try taking the rowboat out of here
[2:37:51] <kerotuyu> AW YEAH, UNDERWATER SEQUENCES
[2:37:53] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> OKAY FIRST OFF, bulkheads don't tear off like that
[2:37:54] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @doc_ock_rokc Unlike water as a liquid, water is very compressible as a gaas
[2:37:54] <Monkeyweed21> JUST SWIM THROUGH THE BOILING HOT WATER
[2:37:54] <%the_vedo_show> LUL
[2:37:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @XeroSigmaPrime Yes the water in the ocean was vaperized and went upward like a giant bubble
[2:37:56] <%Kegeto> They should be dead
[2:37:56] <%SWFanatic> this is just silly
[2:37:57] <detritus25> That's some clearing.
[2:38:00] <%CrookedSpiral> unda da sea
[2:38:00] <%chhdez> JEsus, that's some fast swimming
[2:38:07] <%rytisone> dmc underwater level
[2:38:07] <%Maids4lyfe> doors should be impossible to open with the water in the way
[2:38:09] <%DensityD> is this good gameplay right now? how does it feel?
[2:38:10] <%Jekado> can she drown?
[2:38:12] <SpoonDawg> DAT ASS Kappa
[2:38:13] <Bryceanater> IM COOO
[2:38:14] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Secondly, IF it did, the person behind would be fuckin dead
[2:38:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @XeroSigmaPrime Think boiling water
[2:38:15] <%krawtch> at worst that water is tepid
[2:38:15] <%supersugoisenpai1> That should have killed them
[2:38:16] <%Jekado> seems she can be down there for a while
[2:38:17] <%michingmallecho> Let’s go pat
[2:38:17] <detritus25> Also that's absolutely death with that much water.
[2:38:18] <Mr__Volk> thats not how water works LUL , they should have been squished
[2:38:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @doc_ock_rokc Then water would rush in directly under the steam, not away from it
[2:38:23] <%DensityD> how much air
[2:38:24] <%consistentlylistless> this scene needs the Sonic 2 drowning music for added effect
[2:38:27] <youlookokgetin> You almost turned into a Jill Soup
[2:38:28] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> we need to find the script!
[2:38:33] <Run44forrest> parker drowning to get a look at that ass
[2:38:37] <%ittla> make sure to keep track of emma's o2 meter
[2:38:41] <KaraRedgrave> dont forget those custom parts
[2:38:41] <tigerfang86> SUPER long
[2:38:42] <DazedCookies> This is one of the good RE games?
[2:38:42] <Dragovus> No timer on screen means infinite time Parker
[2:38:44] <%chhdez> Drink the water to solve the problem
[2:38:45] <%krawtch> the water provides a gun mod
[2:38:46] <codycurry52> Parker want dat booty, but he can't have it
[2:38:48] <%SWFanatic> thank you for number
[2:38:48] <FriendlyCheer> We managed to avoid drowning!
[2:38:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @XeroSigmaPrime Nope the Steam pushes the water UPWARDS
[2:38:53] <%DensityD> I'm reading my lines. from the script. we don't have. long.
[2:38:55] <Monkeyweed21> its clearly not rising
[2:38:56] <yourliteraldog> No response
[2:38:56] <SaltyDongs> nice
[2:38:57] <Aracon_> everything's fine parker sheesh
[2:39:04] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Only Claire can have that booty
[2:39:10] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @doc_ock_rokc But theres not water above the steam...
[2:39:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you'll find your way there
[2:39:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hehehe
[2:39:15] <+DesertPenguin> Thinking never helped anyone
[2:39:16] <%consistentlylistless> Big mistake
[2:39:17] <+Pookiedaexzile> Imagine the smell in that suit after a stress swim
[2:39:19] <SkyPirateArcane> Oh the horror
[2:39:21] <Deadbulky> LUL
[2:39:23] <%SWFanatic> shits locked
[2:39:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Don't worry Pat, I don't know either :)
[2:39:24] <%Mister_McDerp> trust?
[2:39:24] <%SoFarFetched> Pat you can probably grab that weapon part on that tank. Since I assume that place is flooded now.
[2:39:25] <+Pookiedaexzile> Imagine the smell
[2:39:25] <tigerfang86> trust LUL
[2:39:25] <%goose_attack_almanac> thats a terrible idea. You know we'll lie
[2:39:26] <%heartlesshealer> he's doomed
[2:39:28] <Aracon_> oh I can't help you I have no idea what's going on
[2:39:31] <DashXero> Don't trust us. Some of us tell only lies. And some of us speak only truths.
[2:39:32] <SpaceCatStation> trusting chat is definitely a good choice

[2:40:33] <CrypticMochi> I’m listening to your dulcet tones while grinding
[2:40:35] <%Kegeto> I am all i remember how this game pissed me off
[2:40:36] <%Oxybe> I'm just here for the "Screamy Boi and his Dysfunctional Gremlins Show"
[2:40:37] <%JJCheeker> i must admit I am playing free cell
[2:40:37] <Finakala> I'm half watching the stream and half doing endgame crafting in FFXIV so eh
[2:40:38] <%PauliusMaximus> OH YYYEAAHH
[2:40:39] <%GraceTBM> you could stagger the moon with that thing
[2:40:39] <theKingRamses> wouldn't burst make it the SSG

[2:40:48] <tigerfang86> no shut up BURST SHOTGUN pat

[2:40:50] <yourliteraldog> I'm for one am loving this gritty remake of Donkey Kong country.
[2:40:53] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt ffs Pat your super right a rowboat would have been fine, tidal wave included
[2:40:56] <%GraceTBM> burst would make it closer to the combat shotgun
[2:40:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Back in the water
[2:41:00] <natebud> You might want the pistol for now
[2:41:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, you're low on magnum...maybe go pistol
[2:41:19] <%Huntercd> Jill's pee soaked butt has me distracted
[2:41:21] <%DensityD> psaCanada
[2:41:24] <Run44forrest> the best shotgun in the game shoots in a 3 round burst
[2:41:28] <detritus25> Number go up > Story
[2:41:28] <%DensityD> how do I door?
[2:41:28] <%Essixian> I WANT TO SEE DA JILL, GO INTO DA WATER
[2:41:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @XeroSigmaPrime Not all the water will immediately turn to steam. Some will stay water and that is the water being dragged up or pushed out causing the wave.
[2:41:32] <+Akabane101> Oh god, an under water level? What is this? MGS2!? NotLikeThis
[2:41:47] <%Corporate_Redeemer> That ammo is totally ruined
[2:41:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wawdar
[2:41:48] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @doc_ock_rokc The amount of force on the surface water is negligible on the amount of infrared radiation. And while you're right about water refracting, it doesnt really matter
[2:41:50] <TheLoneWolf1601> swag swag swag

[2:42:44] <%king_wragles> What's the reference?

[2:43:50] <Aracon_> parker do something
[2:43:50] <42nfl19> Does he not have an oxygen meter or something?

[2:43:57] <codycurry52> xenomorph?
[2:43:58] <%Jekado> jill has home court advantage now
[2:44:04] <%Mister_McDerp> the water cushioned the blow?
[2:44:04] <natebud> do not drown
[2:44:04] <C24U> She is like Aquaman
[2:44:04] <%DensityD> water makes it difficult to punch
[2:44:04] <%invisi_bliss> Parker is ok with that
[2:44:06] <%rytisone> wet Jill has more power
[2:44:08] <C24U> More powerful in water
[2:44:09] <%KeystoneA1> You don't have to worry about damage; you do have to worry about oxygen and drowning
[2:44:09] <DashXero> It's harder to hit things properly underwater?
[2:44:10] <startstoprepeat> jill's part mermaid
[2:44:11] <+ledgefiendd> overwater jill is a name I like
[2:44:11] <%krawtch> watching that awakened something in Parker
[2:44:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> underwater jill is slippery like a eel
[2:44:13] <SixthSun2> Because underwater is bullshit, and the devs knew it
[2:44:13] <tigerfang86> the water absorbed the force
[2:44:15] <tigerfang86> obv
[2:44:18] <%SaiyanShoto> The wetsuit gives you strength underwater
[2:44:19] <%SirGO0SE> wheres the g36? its around here isnt it
[2:44:21] <oniwahoo> Underwater Jill is the equivalent of a Goose on the water
[2:44:22] <%cureneckbeard> Moist Jill
[2:44:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> She has ascended into Jill Over Water
[2:44:27] <%goose_attack_almanac> she does over me
[2:44:27] <BeefyQueefer> Most girls who are wet have power
[2:44:31] <%damienlunas> Jill has always had Aquaman powers, but every RE game took place on land so she couldn't show them off.
[2:44:31] <tigerfang86> wet jill usedSweat
[2:44:34] <natebud> just came from there
[2:44:44] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @doc_ock_rokc Ok well rather than type out a reason. This guy who has a bachelors in physics and masters in EE says its not the same thing at all.
[2:44:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The ass is closer to the center of the screen
[2:44:48] <%senorpapel> Underwater jill has dr
[2:44:48] <%ittla> she made sure to do lots of underwater training in case she ever had to fight another shark
[2:44:49] <yourliteraldog> Jill is very damp right now
[2:44:50] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @damienlunas I like that lore

[2:45:06] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @doc_ock_rokc Rekt son
[2:45:09] <FriendlyCheer> This is like the DMC underwater sections, just need to be in first person to shoot those fish.
[2:45:12] <%DensityD> good god, jesus christ father son and holy spirit those are wide child-birthing hips on her frame
[2:45:14] <NocturnalScotsman> Fun Fact: you can drop into a black void at the corner of the vent and swim past enemies, I remember it from a speedrun
[2:45:15] <%krawtch> Jill butt really isn't that big
[2:45:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the part on the tank
[2:45:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh wait
[2:45:22] <youlookokgetin> all your guns are ruined now
[2:45:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> nvm
[2:45:27] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound Been a while
[2:45:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeyeyeye
[2:45:33] <%krawtch> she's just using those myspace angles
[2:45:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @XeroSigmaPrime I studyed Engineering And worked with the military. EE doesn't mean shit when it comes to this
[2:45:42] <%chhdez> Padded butt for flotation
[2:45:43] <tigerfang86> I L L E G A L
[2:45:46] <%SWFanatic> so some evil guy for some reason sent a satellite laser to blow up the ship but now its just wet
[2:45:47] <CheekyBirb> i don't think it was illegal
[2:45:50] <Run44forrest> i think its scatter 4
[2:45:51] <youlookokgetin> not even illegal NotLikeThis
[2:45:53] <%SoFarFetched> Not with that attitude
[2:45:54] <%Essixian> @FriendlyCheer Which makes it weird that Chris hasn't resolved to crush that puss in order to continue the Redfield bloodline
[2:45:55] <%Bane_Kaikyo> C R I M E S
[2:45:59] <%krawtch> very legal, run of the mill, ho hum weapon part
[2:46:00] <tigerfang86> whats the POINT if its not ILLEGAL
[2:46:00] <%DensityD> krawtch you are probably correct and I'm getting irrationally mad about it
[2:46:02] <%SoFarFetched> Dont wory about it
[2:46:05] <natebud> well something unsealed it
[2:46:05] <Marpolo13> shhhh
[2:46:07] <+IMCthulhu> shut up
[2:46:07] <yourliteraldog> Shut up reasons
[2:46:10] <detritus25> NOT ILLEGAL. NOT WORTH IT.
[2:46:10] <tigerfang86> shut up tho
[2:46:10] <%spiritofmojave> shutup tho
[2:46:11] <%Essixian> @FriendlyCheer Wrong person, sorry
[2:46:15] <%Mister_McDerp> that part wasn't even banned in california
[2:46:17] <Mr__Volk> Soggy ammunition, Yay
[2:46:22] <%consistentlylistless> I wanna see the watah go into da boat
[2:46:22] <%InugamiTheHound> @King_Wolf_Rigger hi king, yes it has. I was streaming some COD and I just ended my stream and raided him, woot woot
[2:46:24] <%krawtch> @DensityD theres nothing wrong about being mad when you're being lied to, even if the liar is an ass
[2:46:30] <%Essixian> @DensityD She does have child-birthing hips, which makes it weird that Chris hasn't resolved to crush that puss in order to continue the Redfield bloodline
[2:46:37] <MicrotonalMatt> I WANTED an illegal gun but all I got was this pew pew sound effect
[2:46:38] <mrshazboto> So what actually is the point of this game?
[2:46:40] <+Kingtut9009> Truthfully I forgot most of this game, all this is just reminding me of Raid missons which really need to come back
[2:46:43] <%DensityD> nwf
[2:46:43] <mrshazboto> Also - GREAT camera angle here
[2:46:46] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound Nice. What do you think of the COD?
[2:46:48] <natebud> I feel like the bulkhead may have taken a little damage from that enormous tidal wave
[2:46:48] <%Neo_Kaiser> SO if there's swimming bioweapons, wouldn't some of them be off the ship and infecting the sea anyways?
[2:46:52] <%SirGO0SE> we miss the G36? @trekkie11041
[2:46:54] <yourliteraldog> Veltro
[2:46:56] <%SWFanatic> @mrshazboto Jill Butt
[2:46:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> there was some ammo back there but okay
[2:47:00] <Aracon_> key card worked under water?
[2:47:01] <%krawtch> "swim to da back of da boaAAaat"
[2:47:01] <42nfl19> So does @PatStaresAt have an oxygen meter or something?
[2:47:02] <%peachy996> How dd that open?
[2:47:03] <xeros720> likely there is a glaas window, breaching the bulkhead
[2:47:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> @neo_kaiser I know, right?
[2:47:04] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @doc_ock_rokc Everyone has "studied" engineering. Working in the military doesnt mean anything? EE means i know alot more about interactions of radiation when it comes to a particle understanding than you do
[2:47:04] <%GraceTBM> yeah, the keycard works great underwater
[2:47:10] <oniwahoo> @essixian But Chris only has eyes for Wesker and so long as Claire lives, she can pass on the bloodline
[2:47:16] <DejaraUndead> Pat is just zooming through this water temple
[2:47:18] <Mr__Volk> she must store oxygen on her hips, because they are almost 2 min underwater
[2:47:22] <+trekkie11041> @SirGO0SE i cant remember. i was just thinkinhg about it
[2:47:25] <youlookokgetin> Jill's lungs must be as big as her ass

[2:48:47] <%Jekado> load your guns
[2:48:48] <%Neo_Kaiser> The reason why Tifa can hold her breath for so long during that execution sequence in FF7 is because of her huge tits. Which is why she needs to have huge tits in the remake.
[2:48:52] <%spiritofmojave> Jill can store air for the winter in her cheeks

[2:52:21] <RantingRavager> ONE EXPOSED LEG Kreygasm
[2:52:22] <godzookylives> if this was chronological it would make at least a bit more sense
[2:52:24] <%GraceTBM> this costume is fucking unbelievable
[2:52:24] <ammobasket> was his plan to get lasered also?
[2:52:25] <Monkeyweed21> shouldnt they be killed by the sun laser

[2:52:46] <%DensityD> have to lead the target?
[2:52:46] <Rada150> giant Bobbit worm
[2:52:46] <oniwahoo> Is Revelations 2 improved now that you are fully experiencing the nonsense of Revelations 1?
[2:52:47] <%GraceTBM> hey, did you like that one bossfight from RE5? how about a worse one
[2:52:48] <codycurry52> lol
[2:52:48] <%rytyoung> this was impressive for a 3Ds
[2:52:49] <%rytisone> lewd
[2:52:50] <yourliteraldog> HENTAI
[2:52:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lewd
[2:52:50] <%Neo_Kaiser> Who enjoys a turret sequence?
[2:52:50] <%peachy996> OHMYGOD A TURRET SECTION?!
[2:52:51] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> good old Olive Garden
[2:52:51] <s1rcuit> That's a Monster Hunter!
[2:52:52] <%croxeye> giant worms in the ocean = world is fucked
[2:52:53] <%xUmbraNinja> lmao
[2:52:53] <CheekyBirb> this is a pso boss Kappa
[2:52:55] <%Mister_McDerp> so those are just loose in the ocean?
[2:52:56] <%KeystoneA1> Zone disagrees
[2:52:58] <%spiritofmojave> Hey we ran out of monster concepts, just make a tentacle flesh thing in the ocean
[2:52:58] <%krawtch> hope you enjoy this sequence because the end of the game is more of this
[2:53:00] <+Wesablo> Thats what she said...
[2:53:05] <%SWFanatic> so the boat doesn't have electronics?
[2:53:05] <NocturnalScotsman> this on Infernal is murder
[2:53:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> don't you automatically get an S in this, no matter how shitty your aim is?
[2:53:07] <%ittla> wow this is a video game ass video game
[2:53:08] <detritus25> Why does Chris always get the magic giant virus monsters.
[2:53:08] <Dutchpotato> Wait doesn’t this mean the oceans already infected?
[2:53:08] <Marpolo13> does the boat not use any electricity ?
[2:53:09] <%SirGO0SE> Squid2 Squid2 Squid4 LuvBlondeR
[2:53:10] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @XeroSigmaPrime And that's why it's called "afterglow"
[2:53:12] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Doesn't this mean that the ENTIRE OCEAN IS INFECTED
[2:53:13] <yourliteraldog> Those polyps look so dumb
[2:53:15] <%xUmbraNinja> I love my RE with machine gun turret fights
[2:53:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> the game: "this isnt a plot hole"
[2:53:17] <assman1234> this is so awful
[2:53:18] <SixthSun2> This is also a Monster Hunter boss
[2:53:18] <%krawtch> this is the sequence everyone switches to mouse+keyboard for
[2:53:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> That's game over. Ocean's already psaBig contaminated forever.
[2:53:19] <%GraceTBM> i'm shocked that RE5 didn't end this way
[2:53:20] <%Mister_McDerp> I guess the ocean is fucked forever
[2:53:22] <%InugamiTheHound> these water base bio weapons would destroy ocean ecosystem in couple of days and infect so many animals
[2:53:23] <%Jekado> wow and i thought the on rail scenes in RE5 were bad
[2:53:26] <%GraceTBM> also yes this means the ocean is infected
[2:53:29] <%galvanicpanic821> is this one of those orlando studio rides?
[2:53:29] <natebud> It's like that RE5 boss fight, but they make you try
[2:53:30] <+Restartist> Squid1 Squid2 Squid3 Squid4
[2:53:31] <%spiritofmojave> @corporate_redeemer it's like the pope blessing the Atlantic AOE
[2:53:33] <%DensityD> this is.. this is too fast
[2:53:34] <%SWFanatic> Is this pachinko?
[2:53:34] <Marpolo13> @Corporate_Redeemer shut up. stop making sense
[2:53:36] <%consistentlylistless> I'm sorry what the fuck is happening right now
[2:53:36] <SkyPirateArcane> God what happened to RE? Remember just running around a desolate police station
[2:53:40] <%Kegeto> Re5 wannabe
[2:53:40] <%DensityD> this shooting does not feel good
[2:53:41] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound Shhh, don't worry about it. It's fine.
[2:53:42] <%MrBorisMakarov> this is fine :)
[2:53:44] <Rada150> suddenly time crisis
[2:53:45] <%GraceTBM> these things would cause an economic shipping apocalypse
[2:53:45] <%krawtch> just boil the whole ocean with the satellite. no big deal.
[2:53:46] <Feurta> starfox boss LUL LUL LUL
[2:53:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> It does not.
[2:53:48] <Mr__Volk> its like a bad light gun arcade game LUL
[2:53:50] <%DensityD> damage is almost unavoidable
[2:53:56] <$ZeOrbling> no but action tho! no time to think of plot!
[2:53:58] <%Neo_Kaiser> Can you imagine, sitting in the office meeting, as someone proposes this sequence?
[2:53:59] <%peachy996> @SkyPirateArcane the focus on action and mysterious plots became higher and higher
[2:53:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah I know
[2:54:01] <+mans51> hmm what arcade game is this?
[2:54:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> u luv it slut
[2:54:03] <+trekkie11041> @SkyPirateArcane its going back to that now at least
[2:54:03] <godzookylives> @SkyPirateArcane It gets back to it but it takes a little while
[2:54:06] <%krawtch> Pat going to be really disappointed with the final boss
[2:54:08] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> This is probably the best part of the game. Even better than the Jackass parts.
[2:54:09] <youlookokgetin> what do you mean
[2:54:09] <Belutima> so how is the world not invested with ocean BOW woopsHmm
[2:54:11] <ShinTeach> dino crisis 2 turret ship section but ASS
[2:54:11] <startstoprepeat> big dumb fight scenes just happen wherever chris goes, it's no wonder he got so tired
[2:54:11] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Is that the revlayaton? That the game sucks?
[2:54:16] <%XeroSigmaPrime> LOL is this a Platinum game?!
[2:54:18] <natebud> better than the Irving fight
[2:54:18] <thelonechris> Just set the ocean on fire 4Head
[2:54:20] <CheekyBirb> i want to cry
[2:54:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ah yes, the final boss....
[2:54:21] <%InugamiTheHound> @King_Wolf_Rigger we should be worried because if not bio-weapons, its the Chinese destroying the ocean ecosystem
[2:54:21] <detritus25> I honestly have zero idea how the people of this planet don't accept doom. That universe is horrible.
[2:54:23] <+DesertPenguin> Is it terrible simply because it's so far from survival horror?
[2:54:24] <%DensityD> no shut up, just do it perfect. what? can't you do it perfect on controller? big sarcasm
[2:54:24] <anthonypadron> why did they add this
[2:54:24] <SkyPirateArcane> I know it goes back, but god what were they thinking lol
[2:54:24] <Marpolo13> @Neo_Kaiser can you imagine having it proposed and someone else said "YES"
[2:54:25] <%Dementedpenguin> Investors: BUT DOES IT HAVE SHOOTY BANG BANG???
[2:54:25] <s1rcuit> wouldn't those things mean that the surrounding water is contaminated?
[2:54:27] <+prime_name> Why is Pat playing Bayonetta
[2:54:27] <MasterDecoder> "What's left of her(the ship)" Looks fine to me
[2:54:31] <%SirGO0SE> its like in my hentai games
[2:54:36] <%SWFanatic> i bet you can't even die
[2:54:38] <%Mister_McDerp> you don't
[2:54:39] <%MrBorisMakarov> don't worry about it
[2:54:40] <redrins> spider man wall climbing
[2:54:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> who cares
[2:54:43] <+razielhex> Get T-Pain
[2:54:44] <Feurta> do a barrel roll!
[2:54:45] <yourliteraldog> Can you effectively put a virus in the ocean. In scientific terms the ocean is fucking dummy huge
[2:54:46] <+mans51> don't worry infinite ammo
[2:54:46] <+trekkie11041> dont worry about it
[2:54:47] <Deadbulky> SHUSH
[2:54:48] <%Neo_Kaiser> "Yes! Yes! THIS is what the game is missing!"
[2:54:49] <%spiritofmojave> Doesn't matter LUL
[2:54:50] <MattDemers> I like this Pirates of the Carribean music
[2:54:51] <%DensityD> don't worry about it
[2:54:52] <%krawtch> remember how they can't let the ocean get infected, but theres already virus monsters in the ocean
[2:54:52] <Rada150> i miss house of the dead they had a few arcana they never made bosses from
[2:54:53] <%GraceTBM> this was probably a better sequence proportionally on the handheld
[2:54:54] <%misterspotswood> how are MGs heating up when they're contantly getting splashed with water?
[2:54:55] <Monkeyweed21> Doesnt this mean the ocean is already doomed
[2:54:55] <HeavyManaBeast2> helicopter
[2:54:56] <godzookylives> @SkyPirateArcane they wanted that sweet Call of Duty money
[2:54:57] <natebud> helicopters i guess
[2:54:57] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound The oceans are already turning blue. I've stopped worrying about it cuz it's too fuckin late now.
[2:54:58] <FriendlyCheer> It got bored
[2:54:58] <oniwahoo> @corporate_redeemer The clear signs of infection aren't canon
[2:54:58] <%SaiyanShoto> By paddling away
[2:54:59] <%SWFanatic> pff
[2:54:59] <+Skelegroove> The laser couldn't even kill this thing under the water
[2:55:00] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt peacfully, probably
[2:55:02] <+Lamario91> They get tired
[2:55:03] <+tsatoma> The port side

[2:55:04] <Aracon_> oh okay
[2:55:04] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> port
[2:55:06] <%Mister_McDerp> they gave up LUL
[2:55:07] <%realm_forge> Isn’t this a clear sign of “the oceans are all fucked already?”
[2:55:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, they got tired
[2:55:08] <%Corporate_Redeemer> So how did Jill and Carver get onboard?
[2:55:08] <%consistentlylistless> You have to go to da back of da boat
[2:55:09] <Aracon_> makes perfect sense

[3:06:41] <+trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt it was mixed with the t-virus

[3:11:44] <HeavyManaBeast2> yes
[3:11:44] <%tusk102> THIS IS WHY CHRIS CANT CONTINUE THE BLOODLINE HE GOT STERILIZED @PatStaresAt
[3:11:46] <%JJCheeker> How dare you say that to the baby
[3:11:47] <%damienlunas> This is why Chris won't sleep with Jill, he's afraid of her smashing his pelvis with her thighs.
[3:11:47] <%ElenaManetta> ah i just saw that matt and pat were in glitch techs. neat-o
[3:11:48] <%Ran196> Dont yell at Elmo

[3:12:13] <ShinTeach> sexual tension elevator
[3:12:13] <%InugamiTheHound> mass effect elevator ride
[3:12:15] <%DensityD> LUL
[3:12:15] <Monkeyweed21> Are we sure Chris even has a penis?
[3:12:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> are you ready to have fun with LASERS, Pat?
[3:12:15] <%ElenaManetta> nice environment
[3:12:15] <%GraceTBM> i like the idea that chris is totally into jill super hard but he's actually intimidated by her
[3:12:16] <%YakumoYomi> @damienlunas Sounds like an acceptable risk
[3:12:16] <tigerfang86> WHOA
[3:12:18] <%ittla> that's a cool alien hallway
[3:12:18] <SkyPirateArcane> Oh this is cool

[3:12:20] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Where the fuck is this?
[3:12:22] <primarch_lupercal> that was a perfect opportunity for dialogue
[3:12:23] <%spiritofmojave> HOW
[3:12:23] <Aracon_> Ooooo cool set piece
[3:12:23] <%peachy996> "Hey chris you see how big my ass is?"
[3:12:24] <%joylent_blue> DOES IT?
[3:12:25] <+waltzqueen> This is BIOSHOCK shit
[3:12:26] <%croxeye> how TF is this built on a cruise ship?
[3:12:26] <+razielhex> G36 was created almost 5 years after Aliens
[3:12:28] <%ittla> are you even on the boat anymore
[3:12:28] <majindusto> JUST FUCK ALREADY
[3:12:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I love this area
[3:12:30] <MicrotonalMatt> Eva-vator
[3:12:30] <%Rngiddion> why put a flesh hallway anywhere
[3:12:35] <%ElenaManetta> People don't suspect 99% of locations and places.
[3:12:36] <%peachy996> "Jill please focus on the mission"
[3:12:37] <%GraceTBM> but it makes shipping and material acquisition a pain in the ass
[3:12:38] <HeavyManaBeast2> the ship is a lie!
[3:12:38] <MattDemers> The way the jill walks makes me laugh
[3:12:40] <SixthSun2> I'll steal this cruise ship, NO ONE will EVER know

[3:12:46] <%JJCheeker> Alright this part looks cool
[3:12:47] <$WackyXmand> This a couple who are both married to the job.
[3:12:47] <%realm_forge> THE SEXUAL TENSION
[3:12:52] <NocturnalScotsman> zoomed all the way out
[3:12:52] <ScreamLord> I'm wonder how all this shit can fit on one cruise ship
[3:12:54] <ShinTeach> fucking boat just became the ishimura
[3:12:55] <%DensityD> "I hope we can figure out how to read the lines off this script page to get a paycheck"

[3:18:55] <+NitronStreams> he pees in a bucket under the csmera
[3:18:57] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Theres only like 1.5 hours left right?
[3:18:57] <+trekkie11041> i like this game but but man does it have problems

[3:19:04] <RyuuAoi> @run44forrest I want to know. Take us with you into the bathroom @patstaresat
[3:19:13] <%GraceTBM> detritus there was one back on one of the dark souls lps i think
[3:19:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @GraceTBM died a bunch before I figured out how.
[3:19:24] <%joylent_blue> just the dark souls 1 LP yeah
[3:19:37] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @XeroSigmaPrime We are like 8 hours in, and 8 out of 12 chapters done. Imm say no, we got more than 1.5 hours left brudduh
[3:19:39] <%GraceTBM> but that was mostly pat being wrong, crazy talk had not coalesced yet
[3:19:40] <Run44forrest> @detritus25 an attempt was made. theres a reddit thread and google spreadsheets of pats crazy talk
[3:19:43] <%joylent_blue> the google doc exists somewhere
[3:19:51] <+trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt he lieterally has this then the lab then a turret sequence then the cfinal chapter which is like 15 miniutes
[3:19:53] <%DensityD> !uptime
[3:19:53] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 19m.
[3:20:10] <%spiritofmojave> the spreadsheet is still on the subreddit somewhere
[3:20:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Yeah, he has this part, the lab, second to final boss, then last section with final boss.
[3:20:25] <+trekkie11041> he can easily finish this tonight
[3:20:25] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @King_Wolf_Rigger If I remember right, I think 10 is the only "normal" sized chapter left. Then again, I played this like 4 years ago
[3:20:28] <detritus25> Word. Well as a legion of goblin trolls I'm sure that'll be done at some point.
[3:20:36] <%DensityD> psaGoblin
[3:20:38] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I can't get rid of these channel points fast enough

[3:34:39] <+Pookiedaexzile> Those guys were better than RE's whole roster, you fans are ridiculous . Seriously is nothing a personality now?
[3:34:40] <%spiritofmojave> cute!
[3:34:41] <%Oxybe> psaGib LuvGift
[3:34:42] <%Neo_Kaiser> Sweet, I'll join Pats gaming session for RE6!
[3:34:46] <%xxshadowxx416> do it
[3:34:47] <%DensityD> BIG SIPPY
[3:34:47] <+UnpronounceableName> FeelsBadMan
[3:34:48] <quackfatty> "No" - psaSmug
[3:34:49] <Aracon_> oh
[3:34:49] <%ElenaManetta> Blue monster
[3:34:53] <natebud> You should, it's great for co-op
[3:34:53] <+budyd> coward
[3:34:54] <%Maids4lyfe> re6 better solo
[3:34:54] <%HRDSalami654> Boooooo!
[3:34:57] <%joylent_blue> but that's perfect Kappa
[3:34:58] <TwinBat> perfect for paige
[3:35:01] <%Kegeto> Elmo
[3:35:01] <Deadbulky> Big Coward
[3:35:01] <Run44forrest> wait what really
[3:35:02] <%spiritofmojave> that's perfect thi
[3:35:02] <d00hicky2> No Revelation 2?
[3:35:03] <%xxshadowxx416> do with woolie
[3:35:03] <%Corporate_Redeemer> LET US INVADE YOUR GAME
[3:35:04] <%GraceTBM> @Pookiedaexzile these guys are like binary domain characters
[3:35:04] <%ElenaManetta> Do you change Monsters on purpose or just grab the first you see in a store
[3:35:05] <%peachy996> @Pookiedaexzile You're right. I love the taste of shit.
[3:35:06] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @tusk102 On his one stream on Daemon X Machina, he stated that he'll probably never stream it again.
[3:35:08] <Jetsfantasy> Sounds like a perfect mode for Paige
[3:35:08] <Aracon_> but that's literally perfect for paige
[3:35:14] <%DensityD> invaded by dark spirit
[3:35:17] <%ElenaManetta> I keep going for the low carb Monster even though its not as tasty as default
[3:35:19] <Run44forrest> thats perfect for paige LUL
[3:35:20] <%SoFarFetched> @d00hicky2 People voted for RE6 to play now and REV2 later
[3:35:20] <TwinBat> ooooh
[3:35:21] <%tusk102> @King_Wolf_Rigger awww
[3:35:21] <Aracon_> ohhhhh
[3:35:22] <%joylent_blue> ohhh
[3:35:24] <+Starlight_Gamer> so why no paige partner?
[3:35:25] <%Maids4lyfe> just give Paige a disconnected controller
[3:35:26] <%ittla> RE6 only becomes playable in at least single player after modding the FOV to be wider. I cant imagine the game unmodded in split screen
[3:35:27] <deviljhojho_> FUCKIN INVINCIBLE
[3:35:27] <gade177> Oh okay.
[3:35:28] <%heartlesshealer> ah, hidden crutch
[3:35:28] <%consistentlylistless> Oh that's the big bad
[3:35:29] <Valentinius_Anodyne> He leap
[3:35:29] <%BionoidLCR> you people are idiots
[3:35:29] <%peachy996> It's the tits
[3:35:31] <natebud> Every time I've seen people play RE6 coop they had a great time because of how trash it is
[3:35:32] <%joylent_blue> that makes more sense
[3:35:33] <%Neo_Kaiser> Co-op players can have infinite ammo with double damage shotguns.
[3:35:33] <+budyd> cow
[3:35:33] <%GarbageNirvana> So it's actually easier solo
[3:35:34] <%ElenaManetta> it's 12:30
[3:35:36] <+budyd> ard
[3:35:38] <oniwahoo> @d00hicky2 I believe Revelations 2 is after 6
[3:35:38] <Run44forrest> ok so whats the problem?
[3:35:42] <+budyd> coward
[3:35:43] <%DensityD> YOU'RE BULLSHIT
[3:35:46] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> yay
[3:35:46] <%heartlesshealer> yay
[3:35:47] <%joylent_blue> yayyy
[3:35:49] <deviljhojho_> i dont believe you
[3:35:50] <%SoFarFetched> Pat doesn't like the cheats.
[3:35:50] <%D3rrtyD4n> @ElenaManetta i like the zero monsters and the blue one
[3:35:52] <ammobasket> yay
[3:35:54] <%spiritofmojave> 14 yayyyyy
[3:35:55] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> whoo can't wait to suffer with you all
[3:35:56] <+HyperCharge_Sam> you coulda finished it today and did RE6 tomorrow!
[3:35:56] <theKingRamses> don't believe his lies
[3:35:57] <%D3rrtyD4n> sounds good
[3:36:02] <%spiritofmojave> Giraffe blowjobs boooo
[3:36:02] <%Neo_Kaiser> GRIP
[3:36:03] <deviljhojho_> damn
[3:36:07] <Kain5707> 14 tomorrow too?
[3:36:07] <MrDonTacos_> cant wait for RE6 FeelsGoodMan
[3:36:07] <%ittla> re6 default FOV is an absolute fuckin nightmare
[3:36:08] <%joylent_blue> damn, got told
[3:36:09] <%Neo_Kaiser> Play GRIP it's a racing game.
[3:36:10] <deviljhojho_> i guess i believe you now
[3:36:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I was pretty sure they set the ending of Rev2 right before RE6
[3:36:16] <%GraceTBM> how many donations to finish it tonight?
[3:36:16] <d00hicky2> RE6 will take like a week
[3:36:18] <%SoFarFetched> HE'S DELAYING THE INEVITABLE
[3:36:19] <%cvp5127> coward
[3:36:24] <+Skelegroove> Delaying it will only make it worse
[3:36:25] <%ElenaManetta> Blursday?
[3:36:25] <%D3rrtyD4n> wednesday
[3:36:25] <godzookylives> can't escape from crossing fate
[3:36:25] <deviljhojho_> prethursday
[3:36:26] <%tusk102> WHY WOULD HE WANT IT NOW
[3:36:26] <%DensityD> brain is stopping
[3:36:27] <%Mister_McDerp> wodin's day
[3:36:27] <%spiritofmojave> I agree with this decision
[3:36:27] <%heartlesshealer> Miercoles
[3:36:27] <%peachy996> Wednesday is not that far away
[3:36:27] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Tuesday part 2
[3:36:28] <%consistentlylistless> That's podcast day
[3:36:30] <%GinAndRoses> the scam is revealed
[3:36:32] <%ittla> the game was designed like an actual action game but has an FOV tighter than satan's asshole
[3:36:32] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> he forgot Wednesday exist
[3:36:36] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @ElenaManetta there's a Monster with a come-hither mermaid on it, and that's one of my favourites.
[3:36:42] <gade177> Honestly I would delay RE6 as much as possible.
[3:36:43] <%tusk102> Guys give pat at least SOME respite from the garbage
[3:36:45] <%ElenaManetta> I like it when people donate to Pat to give Paige a message because Pat still gets the money
[3:36:46] <Run44forrest> the what
[3:36:52] <%xUmbraNinja> Love ya pat
[3:36:53] <%tank7013> Pat clearly delaying RE6 in the hope he wont have to finish it before the 20th
[3:36:56] <%SoFarFetched> ARE WE THOUGH?

[3:42:24] <%punkthepsychopenguin> PogChamp100 PogChamp100 PogChamp100 Pat, I want you to know that you need to rethink your mindset that it is just a game. If Ninja has taught us anything, you need to be mad twice or else you've lost. Never stop improving. Like how Ninja still can't cut bread, you must learn to cut bread. Be better than Ninja, Pat.

[3:42:44] <%lionandfox21> I've never play FF14, would you recommend for new people?

[3:46:50] <Run44forrest> oh no no no no no no pat hasnt gotten to chapter 11 yet
[3:46:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> but the fish
[3:46:53] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, that's not enough
[3:46:56] <%falineth> it's a virus not a poison!
[3:47:00] <%Tersalus> but what if a whale just chugs that
[3:47:01] <+budyd> so good stuff
[3:47:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> BUT THE FISH LET IT REPRODUCE
[3:47:05] <%D3rrtyD4n> hmmm
[3:47:07] <%chhdez> Don't you dare bring up that Stand from Vento Aureo
[3:47:07] <%spiritofmojave> but it's like the pope holy watering the ocean tho
[3:47:08] <%heartlesshealer> unless it got caught in a pool or enclosed bay or some weird crap
[3:47:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Bit more than that
[3:47:10] <%vectorless_peon> ITS A BLOODBORNE VIRUS AND PROBLY DENATURES in ocean water
[3:47:10] <%DensityD> good things, I'm sure
[3:47:10] <%SirGO0SE> but if one fish gets infected thats a bunch of fish getting infected from it no?
[3:47:14] <natebud> Pat, virus not poison
[3:47:19] <Run44forrest> PepeLaugh FRIDGE
[3:47:19] <%Hiro01231> not a poison, viruses reproduce pat
[3:47:21] <%misterspotswood> viruses arent poison, look at china, one bat made the whole country shut downn
[3:47:21] <%D3rrtyD4n> i see
[3:47:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @PatStaresAt THE FISH FUCK PAT
[3:47:23] <%Tersalus> but whale chug tho
[3:47:26] <+HyperCharge_Sam> but the fish become zombies and infect other fish
[3:47:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> There's still parts of the game you havent seen yet
[3:47:31] <%DensityD> jump that shark
[3:47:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> FISH THOUGH
[3:47:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> there's more
[3:47:35] <%rdark_ksu> Ocean big
[3:47:35] <%Maids4lyfe> the fish can't get infected
[3:47:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Poison doesnt die, VIRUSES DIE
[3:47:36] <+razielhex> Here we have @PatStaresAt not understanding virus reproduction cycles and how the Grey Goo can accumulate through massive self-replication using biotic matter.
[3:47:36] <%hatesdps> zombo fish
[3:47:37] <%spiritofmojave> BUT FISH
[3:47:38] <+trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt its way more than that there alot more than what you saw
[3:47:41] <%heartlesshealer> viruses reproduce via living organisms
[3:47:45] <%Maids4lyfe> they don't have enough mass to carry the virus
[3:47:45] <%D3rrtyD4n> feesh
[3:47:45] <%DensityD> Notorious B.I.G.

[3:47:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> feeesh
[3:47:57] <%senorpapel> But you infect the plankton. @patstaresat
[3:47:59] <%misterspotswood> yeah so its dumb
[3:47:59] <suikudo> Arent those fish fresh water anyway?
[3:48:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> F
[3:48:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I think the liquid itself is the issue?
[3:48:05] <youlookokgetin> those are just big fish
[3:48:06] <42nfl19> Can a virus lay dorment, then peopl eat the fish and become infected?
[3:48:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the red liquid. I dunno.
[3:48:08] <+NitronStreams> RE world is fucked with all the viruses out in the wild
[3:48:09] <%Tersalus> yep you're not wrong
[3:48:09] <MicrotonalMatt> It’s actually an STD so Chris is the only safe hoomun
[3:48:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah the ocean's fucked
[3:48:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> It's still fucky
[3:48:14] <%Hiro01231> yeah the world should already be fucked
[3:48:14] <+budyd> name two
[3:48:15] <oniwahoo> YES! It's moronic, Pat, that's the point
[3:48:18] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> BUT THE WHALES FUCK THO
[3:48:19] <+razielhex> @senorpapel The Krabby Patty Secret Recipe will finally be MINE!! -- Umbrella, probably.
[3:48:19] <MrDonTacos_> it's a fucking videogame, WHO CARES
[3:48:19] <%chhdez> Ocean's cursed
[3:48:27] <%DensityD> this is fun
[3:48:30] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah but then other fauna/people consoom fish
[3:48:30] <Run44forrest> it doesnt PepeLaugh
[3:48:32] <%Shadowpint> I've already become desensitized by RE's complete rejection of real physics or science
[3:48:40] <%DensityD> I appreciate this breakdown, this is fun.
[3:48:43] <Bryon_Youngblood> No one said Resident Evil makes sense, Pat.
[3:48:43] <%senorpapel> @razielhex krabby patty secret formula is patrick. We all know that
[3:48:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> there is
[3:48:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> The natural Abyss virus is not the same as T-Abyss
[3:48:46] <%GraceTBM> just put little cones in the ocean to say avoid this zone
[3:48:49] <%vectorless_peon> it probably actually has a low transmission rate outside of that liquid which is probably infected blood
[3:48:50] <%bevyrage> The liquid would need to BE the ship
[3:48:50] <%Neo_Kaiser> So why are they even on the boat?
[3:48:50] <%croxeye> I can see where pat's coming from, my brain keeps jumping to earth fucked tho
[3:48:51] <%consistentlylistless> yeah fuck the ocean
[3:48:51] <%rdark_ksu> Poorly thought out plot points? In my RE game?
[3:48:51] <%SirGO0SE> zombie fish do live forever though?
[3:48:54] <%Maids4lyfe> RE6 also dumped the C virus into the ocean too with the HOSS monster
[3:48:55] <%goose_attack_almanac> The T-Abyss viruses greatest weakness SALT WATER
[3:49:01] <natebud> What if the virus survives in water and mutliplies
[3:49:06] <%Shadowpint> Leon/Claire would've died at the start of RE2 Remake when they get slammed into the car
[3:49:17] <%Maids4lyfe> @natebud viruses can't multiply without hosts
[3:49:19] <%Neo_Kaiser> DMC3
[3:49:21] <%XeroSigmaPrime> WAIT WAHT?!

[3:49:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ???
[3:49:30] <%heartlesshealer> depending on when the ship was designed, the liquid could be the entirety of what makes up some of the space between the outer hull and the true insides of the ship
