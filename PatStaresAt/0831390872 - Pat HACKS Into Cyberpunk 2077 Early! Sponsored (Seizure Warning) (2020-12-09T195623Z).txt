[0:11:14] <+Samsquanch> ray tracing is wonderful
[0:11:14] <blewlamb> smh
[0:11:14] <+eanscrale> Think of the LIGHTING
[0:11:15] <SilverFaustX> rtx is just reflections of shadows
[0:11:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Make the Dick Binkie size

[0:11:15] <TheChapyGuy> BIG AGREE

[0:11:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> This is all Greek to me
[0:11:18] <AstrodropGaming> Don't know why people though CDPR got their act together when 2 of the 3 Witcher games are super buggy
[0:11:18] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @PatStaresAt can you explain ray tracing?
[0:11:18] <%dekkitout> Horse launching in Skyrim is the greatest use of jank
[0:11:19] <gyrwyrm> Raytracing will go the way of 3dtvs
[0:11:21] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Pat, notorious hater of gimmicks
[0:11:21] <jbournehd> ray tracing? more like gay tracing
[0:11:22] <Chaos_kun> Potato pc confirmed
[0:11:23] <dinnydanny777> Trace the Raynbows
[0:11:24] <%BoxNavy> its the destroy your frame rates setting
[0:11:25] <%Evil_Emu147> @trollking96 unfortunately no
[0:11:28] <%Daxalog> Minecraft had Raytracing on as a mod 2-3 years after it came out
[0:11:28] <+borat210> I can accept that
[0:11:28] <+shapeforn> That was a spot on impression patton
[0:11:28] <+punterxpunter> jseHydrate jseHydrate jseHydrate jseHydrate jseHydrate jseHydrate
[0:11:29] <Mudze7> it's nice but it's not groundbreaking
[0:11:30] <%UmoLoco> IMMERSION PAT
[0:11:30] <+Eijiken> pat you motherfucker getting it hours early
[0:11:31] <HollowHex> but muh reflections, pat, I need that 20fps drop
[0:11:31] <%TheActuallyGuyR7> RTX just isn't there yet.
[0:11:32] <winniethecoof> ray tracing is purdy
[0:11:32] <%ClutchRoadagain> Nah but reflections tho!!!
[0:11:32] <%ringabal> SO REAL LOOKIN
[0:11:32] <redrins> also better lighting
[0:11:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> australian reflections?
[0:11:33] <%lil_pudintater9> shadows too m8
[0:11:34] <Pookiedaexzile> Its Dumb
[0:11:35] <%Reveresao> light bouncing
[0:11:37] <pajamawama> I'm so excited
[0:11:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt did you see Insommiac patched in performance RT mode, so it keeps 60FPS now (supposedly)
[0:11:37] <%greasypete00> more like tay racing
[0:11:37] <MSN04_Sazabi> I thought Pat was supposed to be the NVIDIA shill?
[0:11:38] <xanderfist> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[0:11:39] <KingVantq> better light/reflections
[0:11:41] <%Dementedpenguin> Every time someone says ray tracing, I think of the PS1 game Ray Tracers
[0:11:41] <cipher758> sacrifice fps for shiny thing
[0:11:41] <+walnutcast> looking forward to today's Omikron 2 playthrough @PatStaresAt !!!!!!
[0:11:42] <+Pyro_Ks> MID-tracing
[0:11:43] <+skwerley> Raytracing is more for devs than players
[0:11:43] <%BoxNavy> moon2BED wooooow cooooool....
[0:11:44] <%TheBensonator_> Sacrifice your frames for more reflections on the screen
[0:11:44] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Control looked unreal with RT
[0:11:44] <ahaegotrigger> sounds not worth it
[0:11:45] <+borat210> I can see my face in la aqua
[0:11:46] <TheLegendofNate> to be fair it is also shadows and lighting. but yes
[0:11:46] <bob900000> not worth it
[0:11:48] <%BoneofMalkav> It's the Patters of the Patty Pat Pat! psaGib
[0:11:48] <%Breaknoon> 2020 mirrors still impossible in games
[0:11:49] <%maybefalco> sometimes it's really cool, like in the case of minecraft
[0:11:50] <+DarkNerdShawny> HOW DO YALL NOT LIKE REFLECTIONS!
[0:11:50] <Ornex55> cod uses raytracing for shadows, which is a way better use i think
[0:11:50] <justinjones1989> so it's pointless why would you want 30
[0:11:51] <winniethecoof> I CAN SEE IT!
[0:11:52] <%Gogogolem> But pat don't you want the reflections off your bald head?
[0:11:52] <%ClutchRoadagain> I wanna see my Cyberpunk dick in the mirror, goddammit
[0:11:52] <%a_c_chirns> framerate damage tomatoCrust
[0:11:52] <BuffaTV> Ray tracing is fine at best but its usually blindingly unrealistic

[0:12:01] <theshillman> big hype
[0:12:02] <%cvp5127> LUL
[0:12:03] <CelesteUnrest> idk, I think rt is neat
[0:12:04] <TheChapyGuy> Nvidia's solution to getting half your frames back is cutting the image resolution in half and rebuilding the image lol

[0:28:29] <%cvp5127> seizures are a feature
[0:28:31] <Coystick> No patch more in
[0:28:31] <LoneFonte> yeah
[0:28:32] <%dekkitout> Yeah.
[0:28:33] <%coreyyotto> They kind of have to
[0:28:33] <%Breaknoon> show Gief monke pic again
[0:28:33] <+deviljhojho_> yeah
[0:28:38] <%baronouroboros> why seizures?
[0:28:38] <dukenux> Seizures are merely a bonus
[0:28:39] <%Merhabi> seems like they might go for more warnings instead of fixing it
[0:28:39] <BraxtonSwine> Potential seizures add to the immersion atpOro
[0:28:39] <%Captainahab_37> hey everyone
[0:28:40] <LorcaNomad> it's a lawsuit waiting to happen
[0:28:41] <%Atomik456> @commanderclaw they switched me over to good ole penicilin this week
[0:28:42] <%Dementedpenguin> They better. That would be a massive fail if kept in.
[0:28:44] <+BallinArbiter> That’d be cool
[0:28:44] <TheMoenia> who thought inducing seizures in players was a good idea
[0:28:45] <linkoftermina> hi pat
[0:28:45] <%HitchhikingThrough> This is LOW ENERGY STREM
[0:28:46] <%AgniBrandt> Personally, I want to go corpo and then go HARD anti-corpo post-prologue
[0:28:46] <rkytek> hahaha so many people hoping this game sucks
[0:28:46] <DianaTheAscian> is it even safe too watch this stream?
[0:28:47] <tanarath> But it's not a bug, Pat.
[0:28:51] <%Captainahab_37> pat heads up this game has cock in it
[0:28:52] <%baronouroboros> who thought seizures were a good idea?
[0:28:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> Hey Australia, how you goin'?
[0:28:53] <+Divinity4RAGE> can i get a seizure warning before the seizure stuff? i'd like to not get a seizure
[0:28:56] <%bothebuddha> preloaded this
[0:28:59] <%gyrwyrm> Shut up pat
[0:28:59] <%hermitsen> hermitsen subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[0:29:01] <Chaos_kun> Seizures are a part of the cyperpunk life
[0:29:02] <dukenux> I hope this is part of that Day One patch
[0:29:02] <Wolveus> what the fuck pat
[0:29:02] <+skyheys> Boooo
[0:29:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I feel like if there were Game-BREAKING bugs, reviewers would have had zero problems reporting them for clicks
[0:29:04] <%BoxNavy> preloads opened upf or cyberpunk like 2 days ago
[0:29:04] <jbournehd> pat is dyin

[0:29:13] <BuffaTV> love the pat
[0:29:17] <rytisone> just put warning somewhere in agreement page
[0:29:19] <%Captainahab_37> @divinity4rage i believe it's around the time braindances are introduced
[0:29:20] <+678saintglock> man pat’s yawn speech is so bizarre what causes him to sound like kermit
[0:29:20] <%Merhabi> We will all help shout out seizure warnings
[0:29:24] <%Picia000123> I am still hype as fuck to play this from what I watched, don't know who kicked chat's dog :p
[0:29:24] <%gyrwyrm> Sleepypunk
[0:29:25] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Which Cyber Future would you rather have to get your toilet body from. Cyberpunk? Deus Ex? Ghost in the Shell? Or something else?
[0:29:27] <BraxtonSwine> How long as Pat been streaming? he looks exhausted
[0:29:31] <gorillahandz> cyberjunk
[0:29:34] <mythrilcrafter> Did I miss puppy?
[0:29:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so it's probably jsut a lot of flying apart while they patch the flying apart out
[0:29:38] <Teyaric> Seizure stuff is the BODYDANCE sector.
[0:29:38] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:29:39] <%collind99> The seizure thing isn’t a bug it’s literally just them not thinking about what can cause seizures
[0:29:39] <%Merhabi> Ayy
[0:29:43] <%Captainahab_37> @divinity4rage judy puts a helmet on you and it flashes red and white light that's when it happens
[0:29:47] <tanarath> @divinity4rage Pat's going to try, but he doesn't know where they all are. Assume all clubs + any braindance stuff will
[0:29:47] <+alphonseisbest> OOOH I CANT WAIT

[2:02:03] <AdmiralButtloaf> you hacked the person
[2:02:03] <tattleworm> what if your grenade was a computer
[2:02:04] <+trashcansan> future grenades have bluetooth
[2:02:05] <LunacyRosier> 5G grenade monkaS
[2:02:06] <filialpails> the internet of exploding things
[2:02:08] <Darmanimon> people can hack your dick in this game
[2:02:10] <+cdrom321> It's called "Internet of Things" (IoT).
[2:02:11] <%Rafferty3231> ... that lady sounds kinda like Paige
[2:02:13] <%slickrick1121> what path did Pat choose?

[2:02:18] <Kingtweedy> corpo but it doesnt seem to matter except for the first few minutes of the game
[2:02:18] <%Movemeister> Should have gone with Lord Genome hacking
[2:02:22] <%BoxNavy> REQUIRED tutorial
[2:02:22] <zakaraz> looked more like he forced the guard to self-detonate the grenade
[2:02:23] <Timurine> Can we hack eyes?
[2:02:23] <KingVantq> @Quigsies i see that yeah
[2:02:25] <+pectusumbra> was it the grenade or was it making the robot detonate the grenade?
[2:02:27] <+gustavozxd> but the checkpoint system will
[2:02:27] <%beetus_unlimited> Mayday is that you?
[2:02:27] <OvaltineDream> Da streets just gave us a second chance
[2:02:33] <%PsyqualiaSE> The streets will give you hints and second chances
[2:02:33] <Hoanui> steelth
[2:02:33] <+Zeplin666> what if your grenade fails to arm because the servers are down?
[2:02:34] <%Psyramics> who do grenades have shittily-secured wi-fi? first thing I would do in a fire fight is hack everybody's grenades so they explode on their belts
[2:02:36] <kazadaz> Yeah it's like TVs, it's really hard to buy old-fashioned dumb grenades these days
[2:02:36] <yourliteraldog> It's ment to prevent enemies with wrong ID codes from using it.
[2:02:38] <%missingangle> The streets can be super chill tho
[2:02:38] <+Local16> Pats a big guy the streets will like him and help out
[2:02:40] <RamenRiderZ> Can you get a hand cannon that blows up the enemies' heads?
[2:02:40] <%Captainahab_37> can we be larry david in this game
[2:02:41] <Kingtweedy> cause the game just plays a cutscene skipping you over to the street life
[2:02:42] <b_d_one> I don’t even have epilepsy and those transitions are hurting my head
[2:02:47] <%mybassgotblasted9000> what life path you chose?
[2:02:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There's a few sidequests that are origin-dependent.
[2:02:52] <Jetsfantasy> The grenade has MGS4 style DRM probably
[2:02:53] <$iaraCatunda> i missed the character creation?
[2:02:55] <%RealThiele> just use your cyber eagle vision
[2:02:55] <%JeromeX23> But do the grenades have rollbck?

[2:11:44] <+TheotherKristian> Crazy talk is the best stand

[2:11:50] <%dearghostss> corpo
[2:11:51] <yourliteraldog> Corpo
[2:11:51] <Kingtweedy> like the matrix helicopter learning thing
[2:11:51] <%UvBenServed> Hack the bladder

[2:11:59] <Kingtweedy> yeah its looks alright
[2:12:03] <lazerbear77> @Brothermanhyll fuuuck I'll bet EYE turns out to have done everything this game does and with a more interesting take too
[2:12:04] <+sleepyningyo> looks alright
[2:12:07] <%eyezehuhh> Hope he remembers to Cyberwash his hands after Cyberflushing his Cyberpiss
[2:12:11] <+Shoosler> cyber deez nutsz
[2:12:16] <%CokeMilkRequiem> Looks fine
[2:12:17] <+TheEvilOmega> @gustavozxd Yeah, "alright" is how it looks. Which, for a game hyped up like this, is kinda not great.
[2:12:19] <+TheotherKristian> This has looked liked Deux Ex Human Revolution but more of everything
[2:12:21] <Brothermanhyll> I mean EYE certainly is more interesting right off the bat
[2:12:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> Wait, why didn't the company just activate a killswitch instead of shutting off the cyberware?
[2:12:26] <%Alazull> I think he is still a little salt from how hard it was to set up
[2:12:27] <%CavemanInCave> hes taking a micro nap on his toilet
[2:12:30] <Kingtweedy> nothing is making me go nuts about the game or anything tho lol, just seems alright
[2:12:32] <Oxybe> D R A I N T H E O R B
[2:12:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> @GeneralSCPatton Bad optics.
[2:12:42] <%CokeMilkRequiem> there is supposed to be a day 1 patch so here's hoping
[2:12:44] <Brothermanhyll> Anyway I really hope the game picks uuuup
[2:12:50] <%Ner234> You can't just add the word "Cyber" in front of everthing to make it sound futuristic
[2:12:59] <+TheEvilOmega> It's kinda making my eyes a little tired.
[2:13:00] <%scwry> its definitely a videogame
[2:13:00] <RyuuAoi> Pat will be Pat woolieGLORY
[2:13:02] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @Brothermanhyll @lazerbear77 man EYE was so cool. I wish they did a remake that was more balanced and had gooder graphics

[2:13:29] <BaslerJones> did the game do a bad
[2:13:30] <SPidERMan8576> ??
[2:13:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> How many people are getting eye strain from this? I haven't had anything myself.
[2:13:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> jrez

[2:13:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> jeeeez
[2:13:36] <Brothermanhyll> Pat would like it since it would remind him of his french roots
[2:13:37] <Oxybe> Hey CyberBabe I wanna put my CyberPenis in your CyberVagoo. totes futuristic
[2:13:39] <%Redpointshine> so hows everyone liking cyberpunk? im thinking its like.. an 8 so far
[2:13:44] <+GundamF91> The First Person and Voiced Protag killed alot of the game for me tbh
[2:13:48] <OneThousandTomatoes> so how's everyone cyberdoing?
[2:13:48] <%tus93> CyberPoggers
[2:13:49] <SPidERMan8576> Is pat recovering?

[2:13:53] <teflonbilly777> cuver hemorrhoids
[2:13:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> 7 looks pretty
[2:13:58] <silver_stout> For some reason watching this game hurts my eyes, so much going on
[2:13:59] <Kingtweedy> its like a 7 so far
[2:14:01] <%beetus_unlimited> CYBERPOGGERS
[2:14:02] <%tus93> Cyber depression
[2:14:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> pee break
[2:14:04] <Brothermanhyll> Game looks like 6/10 for me
[2:14:05] <teflonbilly777> Cyber hemorrhoids
[2:14:06] <Kingtweedy> pats making pee pee
[2:14:07] <KingVantq> So far seems people want this game to be either amazing or to flop completely
[2:14:07] <+Kullnes> seems kinda underwhelming so far
[2:14:11] <lisadagz> It's pretty. Don't care one iota for the story/characters yet.
[2:14:11] <Oxybe> Cyberpunk so far is a very ok 7
[2:14:11] <+AngriestAngryArtist> superhuman samurai Cybersquad!
[2:14:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> cyberpee break
[2:14:13] <+Kullnes> 6 or a 7
[2:14:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I haven't seen enough to rate cyberpunk. But I watched some of Kizuna Ai's stream earlier and the game looks much better in the open world than the prologue.
[2:14:18] <+TheEvilOmega> I'm thinking this game so far looks like "I'd rather just play through Deus Ex because it's more engaging"
[2:14:20] <+Zeplin666> still think the penis options should be "regular" and "AUGMENTED"
[2:14:20] <%Arazien> There are zero things about this blowing me away. A fine game to grab on sale, but that's about it
[2:14:23] <HUGE_GIRL> it looks pretty but the main character looks really unlikable
[2:14:24] <%scwry> I think the writing has been poor and lacks any subtletely, its kinda cringey
[2:14:24] <b_d_one> Those flashing transitions in the training section were hurting my head
[2:14:27] <%isa_sensei96> Cyber leg Pain.
[2:14:28] <%CokeMilkRequiem> @RyuuAoi funny i've been thinking of replaying GTAV for a while now
[2:14:28] <%tus93> Cyber7 / Cyber10
[2:14:34] <RyuuAoi> @kullnes Hype too strong. That's always a buzz kill.
[2:14:35] <%baka_sugoi> OwO Hi
[2:14:36] <%talkwiththedead802> @GundamF91 voiced protag i can get behind, but i wish you could switch between first and third like RDR2 because thats the perfect way to handle it
[2:14:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> I'm honestly gonna wait for patches, and just keep chipping away at Cinders Mod.
[2:14:40] <%beetus_unlimited> We’re only in the tutorial I mean once we get moving it should be ok

[2:15:13] <justinjones1989> you're a madman
[2:15:15] <+Kullnes> @RyuuAoi yeah, i didnt have that much hype myself tbh tho, i thought the game would be falling to pieces around now
[2:15:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat you were JUST saying you'd rather have 60 fps.
[2:15:18] <KingVantq> @krispen_wa yes
[2:15:19] <OneThousandTomatoes> pat just relay what it sounds like to us through your own sound effects
[2:15:22] <%hrbeck_> When are we gonna see Ciri?
[2:15:25] <zephyrgun> did pat find the sex toy?
[2:15:27] <%Aeoneth> Cancel music and then we'll see if the RIAA cares if people listen to it or not
[2:15:31] <%StrifeZubia> But paaaatuuuh 30fps is literally unplayabe still frames all the big gamers say so
[2:15:32] <kazadaz> nothin looks as good as 60 feels
[2:15:32] <%NoahilDuce> any sign of the bugs they have been talking about?

[3:02:29] <TheMadBadger> And that is why i looked up stats before :')
[3:02:30] <%SirGO0SE> thats pretty significant
[3:02:31] <%Jaromero435> always stealth
[3:02:33] <%dekkitout> Just use console commands 4Head

[3:02:54] <+FeenieVonKarma> there's bound to be some way to respec in a cyberpunk world right? it's just a question of how much it'll cost and how long you have to wait
[3:02:56] <+SpookyCookieMonster> @AsinPersuasion i understand his confusion now then
[3:02:56] <Kingtweedy> game is available on steam in like, 1 min

[3:31:59] <ShichiNoBushi> He didn't really, but aiming a gun at a cop whether or not you had intent to shoot or if it was even loaded would be justifiable to use force.

[4:28:32] <%ospreyworks> @PettyFunk bravo

[4:28:35] <OldOnyx> Once DRM-free platform has issues running game because of anti-leak stuff

[4:32:24] <%RealThiele> denuvo lies to execs about piracy to make money
[4:32:24] <%cowardman93> I hear it runs really well
[4:32:25] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Probs great
[4:32:27] <%Romuken> you're gonna implode the universe @PatStaresAt
[4:32:27] <%sonofthedeepsouth> I BET IT IS
[4:32:28] <%dekkitout> How does it run on stadia swetDOG
[4:32:30] <+Veraverse> I wonder how the PS4 version runs at all
[4:32:30] <+trashcansan> get the stadia version
[4:32:31] <rudybrossard> IT STARTED DOWNLOADING AGAIN FOR ME
[4:32:31] <lickios47> Chat its woolie time
[4:32:32] <leinadtonu> The thing says "applying patches" on my game, but the download is at 56%...
[4:32:37] <%Rare_Ruiz> I'll let you know, that's how I'm getting it.
[4:32:37] <%Aztec50> gotcha
[4:32:39] <KingVantq> its the ps4 pro version at 60fps
[4:32:42] <%sonofthedeepsouth> CONSOLES WINS THIS TIME
[4:32:42] <+alabastah> apparently its a lot better
[4:32:45] <ExpressNode> I saw an article on Gamespot saying it doesn't have a performance mode but it runs fine
[4:32:47] <yourliteraldog> I wonder to I getting it on ps4
[4:32:52] <%Alazull> @patstaresat I'll let you know
[4:32:54] <%moink1234> How do you feel about the game so far?
[4:32:56] <scrublord009> ... thats not true you went full hard on resolution
[4:32:56] <%SvenHolgersson> Is it CONSISTENT
[4:32:59] <leinadtonu> Should have gotten the stadia version.
[4:33:00] <%SvenHolgersson> Is the question
[4:33:06] <%Aeoneth> Stable 60 better than unstable 60
[4:33:09] <tomahank18> Stadia is running cyberpunk super well.
[4:33:09] <BinaryBetrayer> I've seen gameplay that looks like Borderlands running around Sleeping Dogs World.
[4:33:12] <%CavemanInCave> the game hasnt crashed right, its just been difficult to get installed?
[4:33:13] <pixelkenj> Get the Switch Version
[4:33:19] <%Aeoneth> I get to play the game on fll low settings
[4:33:19] <tomahank18> It’s because it IS the internet
[4:33:22] <%dekkitout> Hey now, soup controls quite well
[4:33:24] <MasterCosmic> 60 fps when loading screen
[4:33:25] <oniwahoo> Stadia: the only way to play
[4:33:27] <+Wizardism> the car chase part also seemed to be dropping frames
[4:33:29] <CrimsonCore90> Does anyone have a stadia?
[4:33:31] <KingVantq> ps4 pro version on ps5 is 60fps is what I mean
[4:33:32] <%sonofthedeepsouth> @tomahank18 I think thats a lie
[4:33:38] <%barkon345> did I miss the stream?
[4:33:40] <%RealThiele> cyberpunk has witcher 3 bones for sure
[4:33:43] <%SvenHolgersson> BIG WAIT
[4:33:44] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Pat loves it
[4:33:47] <%SvenHolgersson> For sure
[4:33:49] <ThatVanGuy> my install keeps saying disk write error
[4:33:52] <Tuna_Can_0> lol
[4:33:52] <+AsinPersuasion> what was so frustrating though?
[4:33:55] <leinadtonu> I've never controlled soup...
[4:33:56] <ExpressNode> How many GB does this game take anyway. Hopefully not too much
[4:33:57] <%FastAsCardboard> psaUp psaUp psaUp psaUp
[4:33:57] <Torgue_1> Why do people think Cyberpunk has Denuvo?
[4:33:58] <%Monkeyweed21> 10/10
[4:33:59] <%moink1234> moink1234 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! How are you feeling about cyberpunk so far? Got a 3080 and want to max it out with DLSS at 1440p. Is performance as bad as they say?
[4:33:59] <Schlongalong> @PatStaresAt what's wrong with cyberponk
[4:33:59] <tomahank18> I’ll die by the sword for my stadia
[4:34:03] <DianaTheAscian> it will never be worth it
[4:34:04] <cipher758> patience
[4:34:05] <+Veraverse> #NeverNude
[4:34:07] <%Mantorok06> psaBig
[4:34:15] <%sonofthedeepsouth> nah
[4:34:23] <BlkFlameKami> not really
[4:34:23] <yourliteraldog> Thats literally cyberpunk
[4:34:24] <%Scottigecko> Ps4 pro is locked 30
[4:34:24] <tomahank18> Pats a total never nude if I’ve ever seen one.
[4:34:32] <+rickelstiltskin> PAT AN INFLUENCER!?!
[4:34:35] <CrimsonCore90> Pat doesn't have rent, he has a mortgage
[4:34:36] <Sigma_190_Beta> That's not Cyberpunk.
[4:34:44] <%sonofthedeepsouth> dew it
[4:34:51] <rekinom> Did I miss it?
[4:34:51] <ZE_Count> I cant tell the difference between 30 and 60 fps.
