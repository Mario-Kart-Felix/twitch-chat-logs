[0:01:48] <TheAngryArtist> lets collect waifus
[0:01:49] <marvel877> Is there something wrong with my eyes or did Twitch change the font for the letters in chat?
[0:01:49] <%GalacticaPhanto> oh boy do I hope this game doesnt evolve into extremely predatory gacha practices in the future
[0:01:50] <beatie_g> seriously tho I'm uncomfortable with how much fun Genshin is actually
[0:01:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> Somebody donate $200 son pat has to do loot boxes
[0:01:55] <%AzureGale> Can't wait for Pat to become a whale
[0:02:00] <+TopTierHarley> font has changed

[0:02:29] <+TopTierHarley> Use elemental combos
[0:02:32] <DevinMayCry> Oh I never saw this with Zangief added. Hes not hamburgery enough
[0:02:32] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> *how much fun
[0:02:33] <valriot> @dxlelouch24 Constellations are SUPER good, also Xiangling drop seems to be bugged cos everyone's getting her dupes
[0:02:34] <%PanicSwytch> Its Basically Free Money
[0:02:34] <+Kincast_Witchy> Battle mechanics will get better as time goes on
[0:02:40] <%DensityD> Zangief's Character card is too strong. it has better animation
[0:02:44] <Sotetsu> Switching between characters and dash cancelling is enough complexity for me.

[0:16:05] <katocrimson> They put a lot money in making the game. Most cutscenes and npcs are voice acted and in 4 languages
[0:16:05] <Sotetsu> This is why Paige isn't allowed to own a car

[0:19:53] <%Bailey__gaming> @patstaresat if Paige doesn't let you have cakes does that mean you can't have a subway now? I like my cake sandwich
[0:19:55] <1matheuw> ay

[0:20:08] <Solidnick18> they are reworking it tho
[0:20:09] <+MelodyMedley> LUL
[0:20:10] <+Akizea> oh boy here we go
[0:20:12] <+dmtjinni> BIDEO GAMES
[0:20:14] <Solidnick18> probably
[0:20:14] <diarmid> PatStares at Credit Card Statement
[0:20:15] <%Tornix> they're changing it at least
[0:20:15] <FlamingNarwhal> its the worst rates ive ever seen in a gacha
[0:20:15] <+gustavozxd> I have two friends who already spent 50 bucks each
[0:20:18] <DevinMayCry> Have you heard the supposed leaks for gacha changes in 1.1? Or would you rather not speculate til confirmed
[0:20:18] <%Regigangster> Fuk u titch
[0:20:18] <+BallerSwagBro9k> FGO gacha is worst
[0:20:19] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> i do but i won't :)
[0:20:20] <Djinnazz> yes, everyone unsubscribe top save pat from himself.
[0:20:21] <+Harro8> Rumors that theyre changing it
[0:20:21] <RoboticRexkek> mine is broken
[0:20:22] <+GingerStrawhat> It's such bullshit to watch VODS now
[0:20:23] <+xeros720> that's just a rumor that it's being reworked
[0:20:23] <zenith0111> GACHA GAMES ARE CANCER
[0:20:24] <+TopTierHarley> Hey, all my free rolls have been decent, got a 5 star and shot I wanted
[0:20:24] <%AzureGale> @Solidnick18 The leak was false
[0:20:25] <fuji_92> the gacha will change in 1.1
[0:20:26] <+BallerSwagBro9k> And yet I pull
[0:20:28] <nailwind> man the music in this game slaps hard
[0:20:29] <+warlockwithapixie> yeah mines not working
[0:20:31] <+melanthia_> i dont think ad blockers exist unfortunately
[0:20:33] <+Fenrein> Travis Scott knows though
[0:20:35] <+xeros720> it doesn't have a properly cited source
[0:20:35] <exack> @Solidnick18 Sadly that's just rumors. Leak was fake
[0:20:36] <cherrycottontail> Alternative Twitch Player for Firefox and Chrome
[0:20:37] <TheViltsuZ> The game runs at 30fps on PS4 and PS4 Pro but it's 60fps and even 120fps on phones and tablets lol.
[0:20:39] <Solidnick18> i got 15 today
[0:20:39] <+Basilias_Maximus> It actually seems to get through both Ublock and a Pihole.
[0:20:39] <+GingerStrawhat> Like the Vods are so full of Ads now it's rediculous
[0:20:40] <Sotetsu> Weapon rewards in gacha games suuuuuck. I should feel just as excited when I get a weapon as when I get a character.
[0:20:41] <+dmtjinni> and Page
[0:20:41] <+hi_imjams> @PatStaresAt I'm really enjoying this game so far but for some reason I get over this vibe of inauthenticity, I can't explain it and maybe I'm insane but part of it just feels off and plastic to me
[0:20:42] <%amonimis> wait omg gifted a sub, thank you so much tizz86!
[0:20:43] <%paladinstarbuster> FGOs gacha is actually better
[0:20:43] <Thalchampz> LUL
[0:20:43] <katocrimson> there's 2 gacha currency one for limited banner 1 for normal banner
[0:20:43] <%Calek> seattle?
[0:20:46] <+Mr_Misanthropy> People need to know about the Travis Scott meal.
[0:20:46] <BlkFlameKami> dog.
[0:20:47] <penitentpentwitch> So many quests in Seattle
[0:20:47] <%Parapattern> K I S S
[0:20:48] <+BallerSwagBro9k> IM ADLVL 21
[0:20:50] <vVAstrAVv> if you stream twitch to a chromecast it bypasses the ad
[0:20:52] <$Dakuu75> Twich turbo
[0:20:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> Seatle is exploding but not with quests
[0:20:52] <neVan0> LUL
[0:20:54] <elspiceweasel> seattle does that sometimes
[0:20:56] <Mrrccava> give money to pat america is exploding lol
[0:20:58] <$RealThiele> does the anti cheat still get BIOs level permissions?
[0:20:58] <%AzureGale> The 1.1 "leak" is false you guise
[0:20:58] <+dmtjinni> Winter weather + Pat & Page
[0:20:58] <%za7az> za7az subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 8 month streak! Pat can you please add some custom channel point rewards? There's only so many times I can add sunglasses to DogChamp and I have over 150k points to burn. Stay awesome!
[0:20:59] <+MelodyMedley> That's very different
[0:20:59] <Thalchampz> raise adventurer rank by questing in Seattle sounds like a podcast title
[0:21:00] <TheAspiringWriter> huh weird, twitch didn't send my highlighted message. Eh well.
[0:21:01] <dinnydanny777> Is there a dog in Genshin Impact and can you pet it?
[0:21:02] <%crimsonharvest> seattle only gives quests in cyberpunk settings
[0:21:04] <+xeros720> uh, what is it
[0:21:04] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> if anyone is getting ads and FUCKIN HATES IT, google "eyetiger reddit ublock twitch ads", you add one line to your settings and it KILLS THEM DEAD
[0:21:06] <+Littlelark> its not bad!
[0:21:08] <+gustavozxd> other than the gatcha currency, its fine
[0:21:09] <%Roundelay11> if you
[0:21:11] <BlueLunecy> Free currency is actually pretty generous in GI
[0:21:14] <%Nordguy> do ww know how long i have to grind until 1.1?
[0:21:18] <%blitzrush1200> You get a good amount
[0:21:20] <Solidnick18> it's pretty much a grind abit
[0:21:22] <FlamingNarwhal> there's no for sure proof that the leak is real. they MIGHT be changing the gacha we don't know for sure chat
[0:21:24] <%neraren> Its really low but constant
[0:21:25] <+TopTierHarley> Nah it's simple
[0:21:26] <MyNameIsRasus> pero pero per- gaccha
[0:21:26] <+xeros720> i think you get about 100 gems a day, a roll is 160
[0:21:29] <cherrycottontail> Getting currency in this game is shit once you are out of content
[0:21:30] <$zyberion626> the game is generous, but the gacha is cruel. If that makes sense
[0:21:30] <fuji_92> it's not as bad as most gachas actually
[0:21:30] <%BubbaRands> It’s not terrible
[0:21:31] <+BallerSwagBro9k> 10 roll every 6 hours approximately
[0:21:35] <%blitzrush1200> Initially anyways
[0:21:43] <%Bailey__gaming> you can grind chests for the star things
[0:21:44] <%Roundelay11> if you're actively playing the game, you can probably get enough gems to do a 10 pull ever 2-3 days with paying anything
[0:21:44] <TheViltsuZ> The game runs at 30fps on PS4 and PS4 Pro but it's 60fps and even 120fps on phones and tablets lol.
[0:21:45] <dinnydanny777> I don't understand the video game :)
[0:21:46] <%BinaryFireball> Zangy wants the redbull
[0:21:47] <iccehot1> I started this game then read that it has kernel level anti cheat. I dont know enough about pcs to know how bad that is but people didnt like it with doom. So I unistaled it.
[0:21:52] <thatlolifrompersona1> next update is super improving the gacha
[0:21:53] <%Spyke889> Spyke889 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! im enjoying this game but am conflicted i pulled some s tier units but not the f tiers i wanted
[0:21:57] <+Littlelark> the 4 stars in this game are top tier
[0:21:59] <+Promessa_EX> i've yet to come a cross an enemy that made me want to gacha so
[0:21:59] <+dmtjinni> FOOD IS FOR ME?
[0:22:03] <%AzureGale> They must be re-rolling
[0:22:05] <+Ancopro> credit card?
[0:22:06] <+CrimsonAscend> Baby Zangy
[0:22:06] <+CaptainJax> I got a 5star on my second 10roll
[0:22:07] <FlamingNarwhal> @iccehot1 thats already been changed
[0:22:09] <zenith0111> @xeros720 That's atrocious
[0:22:09] <GunEden> playing the game?
[0:22:11] <+xeros720> gacha games front load rewards
[0:22:11] <+gustavozxd> @Nordguy to get to rank 20? idk, you'd have to find a specific strategy to get xp or else you'd have to grind loong
[0:22:11] <%Divryne> MONEY.
[0:22:12] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Grinding EVERYTHING
[0:22:16] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt early in the game probably hass better rates
[0:22:16] <fuji_92> yeah, the 4 stars are good
[0:22:17] <amonimis> swiping
[0:22:18] <LunarRemix> There's only 4 and 5 stars character, the 4 must be top tier.
[0:22:18] <1matheuw> mebe bebe wants redbul?
[0:22:18] <eros104> IRL MONEY?
[0:22:18] <$RealThiele> adventure book
[0:22:19] <Skatedeandre> $$$$
[0:22:19] <%FlakkLIVE> I find myself getting a TON of Primogems just wandering around doing BOTW stuff like clearing camps and exploring nooks and crannies
[0:22:20] <%crimsonharvest> grindin

[0:22:25] <%Takreth> Takreth subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! Now you too can pull for all your random image stat game needs.
[0:22:27] <+Mr_Misanthropy> One of the few games I would play on my toilet and my pc.
[0:22:28] <nailwind> i rerolled and got 3 characters with a 5-star on my 2nd attempt
[0:22:28] <+IntrepidEye> The gatcha rates for fucking bad. Out of the 11 10 rolls I did I got 6 characters. 5 of which were dupes. 4 of them the same character
[0:22:28] <fuji_92> and yeah, no fucking way every 6 hours
[0:22:29] <%blitzrush1200> You get like 100 for main story quests
[0:22:34] <+mikesapartment> it's not possible
[0:22:35] <%AzureGale> Their wallet
[0:22:37] <+Littlelark> You get a lot
[0:22:37] <%FlakkLIVE> Yeah shit man what grind is that
[0:22:39] <+Lexiellent> I pulled two 5 stars chars and a 4 star weapon in one pull, so i figure that's where all my rng went
[0:22:39] <huskarl_zap> DEVELOPERS HATE HIM GET 10 ROLLS EVERY HOUR
[0:22:40] <@SoFarFetched> He said GRIND EV ERYTHING
[0:22:41] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Collect every chest, do achievement, do quest
[0:22:42] <1matheuw> probably a exploit
[0:22:42] <+worldbrand> 10 rolls every six on the same account or on new ones?
[0:22:44] <+Littlelark> just by exploring
[0:22:46] <%Thatguycx> Thatguycx subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:22:47] <WrongIM> The stars don't matter in this honestly just have fun. You can make anyone work
[0:22:51] <%chensterrain> How do you get any 10 roll
[0:22:52] <+Promessa_EX> make sure to do the adventure book and check inbox
[0:22:52] <%artoriasisguts> artoriasisguts subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:22:53] <0rond> FGO is better
[0:22:54] <%Bailey__gaming> I open every chest and convert the things in paimon shop
[0:22:54] <Matermind0> @intrepideye At least dupes are apparently super strong in this game
[0:23:00] <$RealThiele> rub your face exploration and the chests add up
[0:23:04] <+Kief_Gringo> Chests run out, so it will definitely slow down.
[0:23:04] <MyNameIsRasus> @huskarl_zap LUL
[0:23:05] <Solidnick18> same
[0:23:08] <+gambit_gamble> Taiwan you mean pat
[0:23:09] <revoltingimp> SAME
[0:23:10] <KoryMccool> are you garenteed a charecter every 10? ive done like 4 and not missed
[0:23:11] <%goatbait> Does the game tell you how much you spent?
[0:23:11] <zenith0111> THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT ALL GACHA
[0:23:12] <%XeroSigmaPrime> XeroSigmaPrime converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[0:23:13] <+OwlLightningMage> This game sounds like trash
[0:23:14] <+Pookiedaexzile> Chinese Gambling Machine is my Xbox Gamertag
[0:23:15] <nailwind> the gacha to me is basically just cosmetic cus the game is fun and clearable with free shit
[0:23:17] <huskarl_zap> 100 dollar wedding ring dlc
[0:23:17] <dizimous> Nuce
[0:23:19] <+xeros720> then you spent all that money on HotS
[0:23:21] <Sotetsu> I bought the $5 daily log in pass...
[0:23:21] <%AzureGale> Also the time you played Heroes of the Storm
[0:23:21] <pixelkenj> But is warframe a waifu simulator?
[0:23:23] <TheViltsuZ> The game runs at 30fps on PS4 and PS4 Pro but it's 60fps and even 120fps on phones and tablets lol.
[0:23:30] <$Invlux> I'm here in time for the lootbox stream
[0:23:31] <+Promessa_EX> 2 of my rolls were 4 star weapons
[0:23:31] <+Ancopro> we have yet to see if this game is toxic
[0:23:32] <%GutsForDinner> Granblue is a good time waster with cute girls and cool lookin boys. and that game PELTS you with free shit
[0:23:35] <+Promessa_EX> no chara
[0:23:37] <%Divryne> Chinese gambling is Mahjong lel.
[0:23:37] <%goatbait> I also played Arknights and spent 0$ and still enjoy it
[0:23:37] <WrongIM> @owllightningmage its like anime dogma
[0:23:41] <1matheuw> @pixelkenj it is if youre not a coward
[0:23:41] <+KingGilbertIV> I'm a fate fan and i finally feel vindicated
[0:23:48] <+skyheys> I loved Aegis Rim, but I lasted all of 2 hours on Genkai
[0:23:49] <%AzureGale> Glad I decided to play on PC :x
[0:23:52] <+Promessa_EX> that's stupid since i can max it on iphone
[0:23:53] <$Invlux> @goatbait based
[0:23:54] <RoboticRexkek> the PC port as well LUL
[0:23:55] <+killer_squid1990> my friend played the PS4 version and he said they're fucking missing cutscenes for important story bits
[0:23:59] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> psaDogchamp_TK
[0:23:59] <+gustavozxd> that game can run on a regular ps4 if it can run on fucking phones
[0:24:01] <+BallerSwagBro9k> I open every chest I see, I activate warp, do every quest, do all the dungeons I can accces. Currency stacks up fast
[0:24:02] <%legendfather_of_giants> the PC settings could really use some love
[0:24:03] <0rond> did they make is possible to at least switch X and O yet?
[0:24:03] <nailwind> granblue fantasy has given me like 200 SSR's for not playing the game LUL
[0:24:04] <+SilverDevilfish> If they want to get Pat to buy things they just have to put the gacha stuff on for like 75% off so it's free money Kappa
[0:24:04] <LoneFonte> ps4 is really rough right now
[0:24:07] <TheViltsuZ> The PS4 version is censored as well.
[0:24:10] <Xxkinglynxxx> did u see that league completely redid the item system
[0:24:19] <%Takreth> Yeah but GutsForDinner he tried it and bounced off super hard
[0:24:20] <+caramelatte1> these fucking ads
[0:24:22] <+skyheys> It plays horribly. I think I'd need serious OCD to enjoy this
[0:24:24] <%za7az> psaDogchamp_HF psaBlep_SG
[0:24:26] <+xeros720> those run out dude
[0:24:27] <TheViltsuZ> Sony censoring anime butts
[0:24:30] <LoneFonte> not chests
[0:24:31] <gordieda20> Pat Playing a Gacha PogChamp
[0:24:32] <otakon17> yeah currency stacks fast but I bet it spends even faster
[0:24:35] <+Jubelaious> According to CN beta testers chests respawn
[0:24:39] <+dmtjinni> UNswag
[0:24:39] <+Jubelaious> we just don't know at what rate
[0:24:39] <+Necayde> common chests respawn only
[0:24:40] <leinadtonu> @TheViltsuZ What is there to censor?
[0:24:40] <otakon17> save the anime butts!
[0:24:41] <fuji_92> I have 2 5 stars and have spend 0 buck on this... I might tho, just cause I'm having fun, like buying the battle pass...
[0:24:41] <+Fenrein> Imagine being a Nasu fan and not liking FGO. Every announcement I just pray for anything not Gacha related
[0:24:42] <DevinMayCry> psaHoldon
[0:24:43] <otakon17> ZANGIEF!
[0:24:44] <DXLelouch24> Chests respawn actually
[0:24:47] <Justin_Wood> Do the chests not respawn over time? I was under the-ZANGIEF
[0:24:48] <$RealThiele> chests respawn eventually
[0:24:49] <+IntrepidEye> Chests aren't limted. The respawn randomly
[0:24:50] <pixelkenj> chests might repop
[0:24:50] <%StaceMcGate> Nothing going on to make Twitter explode, no sir
[0:24:50] <fuji_92> chest aren't, some respawna
[0:24:50] <%GutsForDinner> @takreth i could see why, the ganeplay is practically nonexistent
[0:24:51] <otakon17> IT IS HE! I FINALLY GOT TO SEE HIM!
[0:24:51] <+Littlelark> You get a currency on dupes you can buy more gacha currency with
[0:24:53] <%Kincast_Witchy> I have heard the lower tier chests respawn
[0:24:54] <+xeros720> chests will respawn, but i don't think they'll have primogems when they do
[0:24:54] <%SirGO0SE> sup gang, is everyone ready to be degenerate?
[0:24:55] <%Regigangster> I can wholeheartedly say that does not even get you get you even close to 10 rolls every 6 hours.
[0:24:55] <beatie_g> I'm pretty sure there's respawning chests too but I also think they're only common ones
[0:24:58] <HitoBeat> Yikes
[0:24:58] <+Promessa_EX> common ones respawn at least
[0:25:00] <%Bailey__gaming> I've seen respawned chests

[0:26:15] <+BallerSwagBro9k> U can just use a map to find the Culus
[0:26:18] <+D00msDayDan> that is, in fact, why they mentioned it
[0:26:19] <nailwind> that was a speedrun
[0:26:22] <+TopTierHarley> 2f sleep
[0:26:27] <%AzureGale> Gief goes from 100 to 0 in a nanosecond
[0:26:29] <+StrawberryPantsu> 1 Frame SLEEP
[0:26:29] <%shurtal> Does that dog run on an ssd? He got fast sleep/wakeup cycle
[0:26:30] <%cowardman93> Gief is such a cute boy I love him
[0:26:37] <%RyTYoung> too much
[0:26:37] <%caramelatte1> Get the battle pass instead
[0:26:39] <Skatedeandre> this is a whale free chat
[0:26:39] <%cvp5127> suckers
[0:26:40] <%MugenSandan> 2 frames of startup and active for 999 frames what a move
[0:26:40] <+MelodyMedley> Very fast sleep animation
[0:26:40] <Solidnick18> the whale
[0:26:40] <%kewlmyc> I'm all 3 :D
[0:26:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> Nice
[0:26:43] <$RealThiele> addicts
[0:26:43] <$zyberion626> dumbs, rich, dumb rich
[0:26:43] <%Tornix> could say they're one in the same
[0:26:45] <+skyheys> is it worth it
[0:26:45] <+gustavozxd> thanks dumbasses :)
[0:26:46] <fuji_92> Noelle <3
[0:26:47] <+Fenrein> But is it faster than a PS5 ssd? Buy a PS5 today (but wait you can't because they're out of stock lol)
[0:26:48] <%cowardman93> the game is legit good to be honest
[0:26:48] <+mMayrro> but muh animeeeeee BabyRage
[0:26:51] <%GutsForDinner> I have yet to see a game with a more lovingly maintained community map than Xenoblade Chronicles X
[0:26:52] <+jiggy_snipe> yes you whales subsidize this game
[0:26:55] <FlamingNarwhal> @caramelatte1 DONT get the battlepass its a horrible deal
[0:26:55] <beatie_g> game rn on dirty addiction money PepeHands
[0:26:56] <%Kincast_Witchy> Buy the monthly card and battle pass, that is all you will ever need!
[0:26:57] <%StaceMcGate> boring to watch tho Pat
[0:26:59] <+Vineslop_Tod> The only purchase that's even remotely worth it is the first 29.99 one after that, not worth it till rework.
[0:26:59] <%Divryne> I AM THE ACE OF STAR WARS.
[0:26:59] <Solidnick18> chasing whales is the dream
[0:27:01] <DKDiamantes> Oh yeah, I forgot about Squadrons
[0:27:01] <+OwlLightningMage> Coco didn't permabanned for using a vibrator or sticking a plug in that girl's ass on stream, so she'll probably be fine
[0:27:02] <%BubbaRands> You’re welcome?
[0:27:02] <%RyTYoung> It's out?
[0:27:03] <+MelodyMedley> It's so dumb rich people can fund the game
[0:27:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> A fool and it's money will be quickly separated
[0:27:03] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Ive been playing gacha for over 5 years
[0:27:04] <+IntrepidEye> I saw some streamers spend $500 on the first day
[0:27:07] <%PadreHail> It's no Rogue Squadron but it's okay
[0:27:07] <%BaddonsBadAt> BaddonsBadAt subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:27:07] <Justin_Wood> I got pretty much everything I wanted from my free rolls, which is to say I got my wolf stand boy
[0:27:08] <%StaceMcGate> its fun but boring
[0:27:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> THE CAMPAIGN SUCKS
[0:27:12] <leinadtonu> That's quite inhumane, gacha I mean.
[0:27:12] <+BallerSwagBro9k> IT HAS NO MICROS
[0:27:13] <%Kincast_Witchy> Honkai Impact whales funded the development of this, thank you Honkai whales
[0:27:14] <%cowardman93> yeah Squadrons is real fun, proper flight controls like ace combat
[0:27:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> EMPIRE DIS NOTHING WRONG
[0:27:18] <%YakumoYomi> I'd honestly just rather pay $60 upfront and be able to play offline
[0:27:19] <Solidnick18> crash came out today
[0:27:20] <Ipsenscastle> it's okay, needs some planetside levels though,
[0:27:23] <%Tornix> the preload DLed mad fast tho
[0:27:24] <%kewlmyc> Download servers are borked
[0:27:24] <+skyheys> @gutsfordinner Best sandbox game ever,honestly. what an amazing map
[0:27:24] <%RyTYoung> But...it's short?
[0:27:26] <Skatedeandre> wha i took me like 2 hours over wifi
[0:27:31] <%coreyyotto> lots of spyware to download y'know
[0:27:31] <FlamingNarwhal> the download is throttled use a vpn
[0:27:31] <WrongIM> @owllightningmage wow
[0:27:35] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt if you pause and restart the download, you get to reroll your RNG download speed
[0:27:35] <AwkwardPon> I'm thinking to get into the game, i want to roll for the aqua witch and virgil girl that does dimension slash. what are my chances of getting at least those two early?
[0:27:36] <1matheuw> what up gameRs
[0:27:36] <fuji_92> it took me an 1 hour on ps4
[0:27:37] <leinadtonu> GAMERS RISE UP!
[0:27:40] <1matheuw> rise up
[0:27:40] <+XatheFlare> i heard if you switch to an asian DC it downloads faster
[0:27:41] <Tomschiii> huh? 15 min at max
[0:27:43] <%kewlmyc> might be fixed apparently
[0:27:51] <%YakumoYomi> Also, fuck did that download take almost a whole day when it should have been less than an hour
[0:27:52] <%MrBorisMakarov> MrBorisMakarov subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months! hey pat, not much to say but still will keep thanking you for getting me addicted to the drug that is FFXIV
[0:27:53] <%Aleate> I downloaded it in like 15 minutes last night... I have no idea how after hearing how bad its been for everyone
[0:27:56] <katocrimson> there's a 30 day pass that cost USD$5 for daily goodies
[0:27:56] <+hi_imjams> @PatStaresAt the key is to pit pause and play over and over again on the download until it speeds up
[0:27:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> KappaPride WW
[0:28:00] <dinnydanny777> GivePLZ husbandos
[0:28:01] <fuji_92> I downloaded day 1 tho
[0:28:02] <beatie_g> truly a shame
[0:28:02] <zenith0111> Gacha games remind me of a dystopian story where they keep this child in a dungeon and torture them but it's benefits everyone else so no one stops it.....
[0:28:03] <+xeros720> learn to love Kaeya
[0:28:04] <+OwlLightningMage> Coco Kiryu is the Eric Andre of Hololive
[0:28:06] <nailwind> @AwkwardPon reroll new accounts until you get either of them. i got vergil on 2nd try
[0:28:08] <%blitzrush1200> Diluc
[0:28:08] <fuji_92> so idk
[0:28:11] <%cvp5127> just one more
[0:28:11] <Solidnick18> i have pulled a few waifus
[0:28:12] <Justin_Wood> It's funny to me that they went from making a mobile only character action game and then decided "Yeah we can take on open world on mobile"
[0:28:12] <%AzureGale> I wish I could get more waifus :(
[0:28:12] <%caramelatte1> Pulled the same waifu 4 bloody times
[0:28:12] <%afronooch> wait, cant we not use epic gamer anymore since gamers hate epic
[0:28:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> NICE WAIFUS
[0:28:14] <WrongIM> You get 1 free husbando plus the main dude
[0:28:15] <+BallerSwagBro9k> KAEYA AND DILUC Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:28:16] <+D00msDayDan> desire sensor is real
[0:28:17] <+melanthia_> have zero standard and you always get better pulls
[0:28:18] <+jiggy_snipe> want something else and you'll get the husbandos
[0:28:20] <Solidnick18> diluc will be mineeeee
[0:28:21] <$zyberion626> Venti: the waifu that is a husbando
[0:28:22] <%Regigangster> Gacha can see into your heart and tease you accordingly
[0:28:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> MAYBE IF YOU PAY EM MONEY
[0:28:26] <fuji_92> Kaeya is a husbando and free
[0:28:27] <maskedmook> I'm getting all the husbandos and no waifus I'm sad
[0:28:28] <%legendfather_of_giants> @zenith0111 you ... i like you
[0:28:30] <+Jubelaious> I've spent years being hardened by much more predatory gacha systems so genshin doesn't phase me BibleThump
[0:28:31] <WrongIM> DILUC HYPE
[0:28:37] <dinnydanny777> I'm guessing the husbandos are rarer than the waifus
[0:28:37] <scarman125> i got Venti and Razor so i'm happy
[0:28:40] <1matheuw> pat is a big and strong influencer
[0:28:43] <AwkwardPon> oooo thats an idea @nailwind
[0:28:46] <+NitronStreams> Pat corrupts yet another innocent soul
[0:28:46] <+gustavozxd> diluc seems fun to play
[0:28:46] <dinnydanny777> Everybody loves a good husbandos tho
[0:28:48] <+Littlelark> Noelle is god tier healer

[0:28:52] <Matermind0> I know a guy who rerolled for Diluc for TWENTY THREE HOURS
[0:28:52] <+Vineslop_Tod> Chat, the trick to downloading is to use a VPN and set your location to Hong Kong, you'll download in like 5 minutes.
[0:28:57] <%Valdorick> So Pat, do you have a spreadsheet infront of you, showing who donated for you to buy waifu points?

[0:32:25] <DevinMayCry> Never expect shit in this game
[0:32:25] <%XeroSigmaPrime> maybe
[0:32:27] <nailwind> the game is insanely high quality, the drop rates are justified tbh
[0:32:28] <LoneFonte> or both
[0:32:28] <quietshun> FGO good
[0:32:29] <+skyheys> OR GREED
[0:32:30] <reonome> they're changing the gacha system in 1.1
[0:32:30] <%AzureGale> The cost of the ass assets. And other assets too
[0:32:30] <MyNameIsRasus> oof
[0:32:33] <+ApocalypticExpress> someone on a discord im on spent several hundred whaling
[0:32:34] <+D00msDayDan> at least there's a half guarantee on the rate-up 5* unlike fgo

[0:32:44] <+BallerSwagBro9k> FGO rates are actually a bit worse
[0:32:45] <FlamingNarwhal> @reonome we dont know that fure sure
[0:32:45] <Arth__> Pat are you gonna reroll for best characters?
[0:32:47] <%legendfather_of_giants> @maenos2 to be fair, fgo also gives out SQ like candy
[0:32:48] <%SirGO0SE> me pity for tity :)
[0:32:51] <%Kincast_Witchy> yeah heard 1.1 is going to be making the gacha cheaper
[0:32:52] <%BubbaRands> Some one FGO? Kappa
[0:32:53] <LoneFonte> they really are
[0:32:55] <%Farples> Farples subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! Heya Pat. welcome to the gacha hell. I managed to get Noelle and 2 Razors. Also recently finished capping all my jobs in 14 and getting started on Light Rampart prog in E8S. PogChamp
[0:32:55] <Solidnick18> that said give pat money for gacha
[0:32:56] <RayCSmooth> There's far less characters in this game though
[0:32:57] <+Harro8> Fischl is 4 star and S TIER
[0:32:58] <%chubbypencil> penny rate or pitty rate? can't tell
[0:32:59] <zamzoph> are there any characters LESS than four?
[0:32:59] <0rond> fgo is better
[0:32:59] <%XeroSigmaPrime> RIP TeamFourStar
[0:33:00] <+killer_squid1990> It won't
[0:33:01] <%Maids4lyfe> 4 stars will carry you very far
[0:33:02] <FlamingNarwhal> theres no proof that the "leak" is real
[0:33:02] <WrongIM> @1matheuw you can use them to evolve your character to higher levels and they give you a bunch of currency i think
[0:33:03] <+BallerSwagBro9k> FGO has 3-5 stars
[0:33:04] <Skatedeandre> huh?
[0:33:06] <+TopTierHarley> yes you get banned for rerolling
[0:33:06] <$RealThiele> pat doesnt get it
[0:33:07] <%legendfather_of_giants> @BallerSwagBro9k fgo is 1%, GI is .6%
[0:33:08] <+mMayrro> too bad Dilus isn't a 4 star 4Head
[0:33:08] <%cowardman93> Pat one of the characters has Judgement cut end as her super
[0:33:08] <+skyheys> lol
[0:33:09] <BlueLunecy> Nah rerolling is pretty normal
[0:33:09] <%BubbaRands> Why?!
[0:33:10] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I haven't got banned
[0:33:11] <%Maids4lyfe> it will
[0:33:11] <%blitzrush1200> hasn't happened yet
[0:33:12] <reonome> make a new account lol
[0:33:13] <FlamingNarwhal> @PatStaresAt reroll odesnt get banned account selling does
[0:33:13] <+MelodyMedley> 4 stars are nore common and they're still pretty good
[0:33:13] <quietshun> It doesn't
[0:33:13] <Hasemeow> its more effort than its worth imo
[0:33:13] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[0:33:14] <DevinMayCry> @thatlolifrompersona1 I started stream thinking that might be real but that stuff is at best spurious rumors and at worst confirmed fake
[0:33:14] <+BallerSwagBro9k> NOPE
[0:33:14] <+killer_squid1990> It's not worth rerolling lol
[0:33:14] <+Harro8> Ot
[0:33:15] <Solidnick18> i won't because i have no idea how too
[0:33:15] <%AzureGale> The 1.1 leak is fake, folks
[0:33:15] <+pectusumbra> uninstall
[0:33:15] <nailwind> they almost encourage you to reroll with how easy it is to make new usernames LUL
[0:33:16] <@ShockzNDrawe> fgo has 1-5 stars
[0:33:17] <Thalchampz> nah it takes too much time
[0:33:17] <phoenix7240> @BallerSwagBro9k fgo rates are 1% for a five star genshin is .5%
[0:33:17] <+skyheys> You make a new account
[0:33:17] <fuji_92> yeah 4 stars are great in this game
[0:33:18] <CHVMPLOO> make alts
[0:33:18] <+A_Windmill> rooCult h-how do you reroll
[0:33:19] <DayDayMaccin1> It doesn't at all lol
[0:33:19] <%Farples> Make a new username
[0:33:20] <LunarRemix> You replay the tutorial over and over again
[0:33:20] <+IntrepidEye> Make a new account?
[0:33:20] <namisrot> zangief is so big now he's like twic the size
[0:33:20] <%blitzrush1200> Register with newusername
[0:33:20] <panic_rabbit> oh man you are going to be rerolling for hours arent you
[0:33:20] <%BaddonsBadAt> they said its highly discouraged though.
[0:33:20] <Kiaayo> just delete your account after you roll
[0:33:21] <%TheDullaMAN> It takes 27 minutes for a good reroll
[0:33:21] <LoneFonte> create thousands of emails
[0:33:22] <%Ixiah> how big is the difference between 4 and 5 stars ?
[0:33:22] <%Maids4lyfe> it will get you banned
[0:33:22] <beatie_g> wait do u not know what re rolling is?
[0:33:23] <+Vineslop_Tod> Rerolling is annoying and not worth the time investment
[0:33:23] <Zebroneath> I'm glad a got Jean on my second roll
[0:33:23] <Teyaric> Reroll is core to gacha culture, dipshit
[0:33:23] <+pectusumbra> literally uninstall and reinstall is the old way
[0:33:24] <+hi_imjams> start over
[0:33:26] <+Harro8> Rerolling wont get you banned
[0:33:26] <$zyberion626> we should kill that Goblin right here
[0:33:26] <%amonimis> rerolling takes like 20min per run tho
[0:33:27] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Make guest account
[0:33:28] <%FlakkLIVE> its like, a 20 minute process per reroll
[0:33:28] <+ApocalypticExpress> I got one 5 star Mona, so im good till next set of characters lol
[0:33:29] <%PinkSuprende> Rerolling doesn't get you banned, selling the account does
[0:33:30] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Just spend more money
[0:33:30] <beatie_g> cuz re rolling is insane
[0:33:30] <%Maids4lyfe> MiHoYo does not want rerolls
[0:33:31] <%FlakkLIVE> dont do that shit lmao
[0:33:32] <FlamingNarwhal> only account selling gets banned
[0:33:32] <Solidnick18> what
[0:33:35] <%President_Miyazaki> It takes like 20 minutes to reroll, it's super not worth it
[0:33:36] <copicmario> pat no
[0:33:36] <%blitzrush1200> easier than making multiple email accounts
[0:33:36] <@ShockzNDrawe> you have to make a new account it's only for insane people
[0:33:36] <%Farples> This is what rerolling is
[0:33:37] <%President_Miyazaki> Just play the game
[0:33:38] <%AmericanaRed> START FRESH OWL2019DVa
[0:33:39] <Alzero83> DONT SO IT
[0:33:39] <+pectusumbra> but it's probably not worth it for this game
[0:33:40] <BlkFlameKami> pat doesn't understand gacha
[0:33:40] <KoryMccool> lol
[0:33:40] <nailwind> you can make guest accounts in 5 seconds and then link it
[0:33:41] <%BubbaRands> That’s too much work ResidentSleeper
[0:33:42] <DevinMayCry> No just deal with what you get. Its the mentality you need to survive
[0:33:43] <+TheSaintJohn> delete system32
[0:33:43] <%Kincast_Witchy> gross don't become a filthy reroller
[0:33:44] <%Piemono> Uninstall game and forget the shame
[0:33:44] <nintega010> I mean I only want Jean & Diluc & Razor & Beidou
[0:33:44] <1matheuw> is the dog snoring?
[0:33:44] <0rond> rerolling is making a new account and rolling the currency uoi start with until you get what you want
[0:33:45] <quietshun> You're too far in now
[0:33:47] <LunarRemix> Yeah it takes half an hour
[0:33:47] <TheNumberJay42> rerolling is for sweaty nerds
[0:33:49] <Teyaric> Its stupid yeah. But its core to gacha culture
[0:33:50] <+michingmallecho> Patricky daphHeart
[0:33:51] <+Promessa_EX> reroll is cringe. tutorial is like 30 mins no
[0:33:52] <Justin_Wood> Rerolling is hell, tbh
[0:33:54] <+Fenrein> Rerolling is too much effort

[0:42:01] <nailwind> nijisanji has actual dog vtubers
[0:42:01] <%BinaryFireball> Maddox is a banana v-tuber
[0:42:06] <%AzureGale> Pat missed the persona tickets in PSO2 anyway :x
[0:42:06] <%Roundelay11> If you do end up doing pulls tonight, try and get Venti. He's probably the best one for world exploration, he can make a wind gust wherever he wants.
[0:42:07] <%Zulrez> You mean like that toilet from look who’s talking? LUL
[0:42:07] <TheViltsuZ> PAT, WHY DON'T YOU DRINK WATER?!
[0:42:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> I will state again, PSO2 WAS NOT worth the wait
[0:42:09] <%ashenfrenzy> well now i have to pull, i want fischal

[0:42:14] <beatie_g> venti sucks
[0:42:15] <+Harro8> Xiangling is amazing
[0:42:15] <+mMayrro> venti is revali tho Kappa
[0:42:16] <%Regigangster> Venti is S tier support
[0:42:17] <TheViltsuZ> PSO 2 IS GREAT
[0:42:18] <%FlakkLIVE> They make up my main squad lol
[0:42:18] <zeif00> FISH STRONG

[0:42:18] <FlamingNarwhal> fishcl best 4star in the game
[0:42:19] <%Ebonyglow> I've gotten Xian 4 times
[0:42:19] <%kewlmyc> Venti has the best super in the game
[0:42:19] <$zyberion626> but Barbara has a hat Pat!
[0:42:19] <LoneFonte> but Venti has Revali's Gale
[0:42:20] <gryffinp> barbara is surprisingly good but you get one of her for free so eh
[0:42:21] <+Axle13j> I want the chuuni dork lol
[0:42:23] <%TheDullaMAN> Waifu Time
[0:42:26] <%ashenfrenzy> theyre not mona
[0:42:26] <ShepardUA> roll for Jean
[0:42:26] <Teyaric> Toilet avatar will get weird big ups from Nyanners at least. Then you can upgrade to Melody!
[0:42:28] <Heroes_of_Vale> Venti breaks the game. His ability to jump so high skips so many puzzles and stuff.
[0:42:29] <%amonimis> venti is 2good, free revalis gale
[0:42:30] <fuji_92> Lang DansGame
[0:42:31] <+TopTierHarley> Jean isn't even the best healer
[0:42:31] <%TheDullaMAN> And Lisa
[0:42:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> Bard boy sucks
[0:42:32] <+LynbellDaYo> don't give a shit about Venti but he's so good that I feel like I have to get him
[0:42:33] <MyNameIsRasus> I want big sword girl
[0:42:33] <%AzureGale> Pat doesn't like them, that's good enough reason
[0:42:34] <+Ancopro> venti has the only cinematic super i think
[0:42:35] <%Ascethetic> Barbara is best healer tho
[0:42:36] <%SwdVengeance> Fisch is literally just V from DMC:V but anime waifu
[0:42:36] <+MelodyMedley> Best to wait until a banner you care about
[0:42:37] <+CaptainJax> I got Diluc from the Venti banner
[0:42:37] <$RealThiele> can you play with anyone else?
[0:42:38] <%FlakkLIVE> SO DO I BUT WE CANT HAVE EVERYTHING
[0:42:39] <KoryMccool> guts lady ftw

[0:42:40] <kyuubisonic> Diluc is RAD
[0:42:41] <maskedmook> Diluc is so fun to play
[0:42:42] <fuji_92> Jean <3
[0:42:43] <Zayasu> i got a genshin impact ad
[0:42:43] <+eanscrale> Jean is just saber
[0:42:44] <+lethallylactic> But Mona tho
[0:42:46] <Jetsfantasy> Venti plays pretty well from what the trial felt like
[0:42:46] <%BubbaRands> Pat has good taste
[0:42:46] <+mMayrro> Diluc Kreygasm
[0:42:47] <%Falilth> @PatStaresAt i did the venti trial and woof he's broken
[0:42:47] <%blitzrush1200> We would all like Diluc
[0:42:49] <TheViltsuZ> PAT, WHY DON'T YOU DRINK WATER?!
[0:42:50] <%mikessdd> PSO2 feels exactly like what it is. A 7 year old game
[0:42:51] <nintega010> I already got Xianglong. I want Jean & Diluc also Beido
[0:42:51] <nailwind> venti and vergil have some fun skips
[0:42:52] <vVAstrAVv> diluc is really good
[0:42:54] <Kiaayo> you forget that pat literally has no sense of timing or rhythm
[0:42:56] <DevinMayCry> Venti ability to just constant aimed wind too fucks up any mob with fire and another element
[0:42:57] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat doesn't have rhythm
[0:42:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> I want Diluc so bad. >>
[0:43:00] <%AmericanaRed> Ningguang Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:43:01] <%illtima> I want Jean so much, but I don't wanna risk on a standard banner

[0:43:09] <%PadreHail> Ningguong is fucking weird
[0:43:09] <Nobuwaroo> guy i really want think his name is xiang or somtin

[0:43:14] <%FlakkLIVE> She's great
[0:43:18] <+MelodyMedley> You also get like three 4 stars for free
[0:43:19] <%PadreHail> Her geo stuff is very basic
[0:43:23] <+mikesapartment> yes
[0:43:24] <stormhawk9891> Yup
[0:43:24] <xxmagonx> Whats the Vergil for this game?
[0:43:24] <%Farples> Yes
[0:43:24] <%AzureGale> Yes
[0:43:25] <%kewlmyc> pretty much
[0:43:25] <Lucasleonava> yes
[0:43:26] <LeftOverPizza13> they dont ban rerolling
[0:43:28] <%BigCoffee> yes
[0:43:31] <TheViltsuZ> @mikessdd 7 years isn't enough time for games to feel any different lol. That's when PS4 and Xbone were already out.
[0:43:32] <+Yakobro> dont reroll
[0:43:33] <quietshun> That's why you do it at the start
[0:43:34] <fuji_92> I got jean from free pulls yesterday Pog
[0:43:35] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[0:43:35] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah you need to do that early
[0:43:35] <FlamingNarwhal> @PatStaresAt no you just make another account using username only and no email
[0:43:37] <zeif00> Oh fuck that then
[0:43:37] <%AngriestAngryArtist> nah don't it's not worth it.
[0:43:37] <stormhawk9891> That's why you don't do it
[0:43:37] <$milhousego> pat if your vtuber avatar was a toilet, wouldn't people just think you were into scat and pee?
[0:43:39] <%TheDullaMAN> Unless you make a new account, yeah.
[0:43:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> Don't reroll, not worth it
[0:43:42] <%AzureGale> Who is the best girl and why is it Keqing
[0:43:43] <+twohitgood> i missed the start alert is this the end of the stream?
[0:43:46] <chancho4tierra> Razor is a Jojo character and the electricity chick with a crow is V
[0:43:48] <Alzero83> It means deleting your WHOLE mihoyo account to reroll
[0:43:48] <Louie_Salmon> I got a 5 on my first roll, so no need
[0:43:48] <%PadreHail> The Vergil is your sibling I'm assuming
[0:43:49] <+thedarknightprinny> my stream stream died for a sec
[0:43:49] <doublinsux> I wonder if pat would ever try out the other game the Genshin devs have on mobile since Pat is gonna play Genshin on mobile/pc
[0:43:55] <nintega010> @fuji_92 lucky
[0:43:57] <%SaiyanShoto> I got Beidou and she’s all I need
[0:43:58] <nailwind> @xxmagonx keqing
[0:43:59] <%FlakkLIVE> @PadreHail I think she's mostly useful for swapping in to use her skill then swapping to another character immediately
[0:44:01] <%mikessdd> Wait meant to say 8 year old game.
[0:44:01] <+Harro8> It'll be a new account
[0:44:01] <DevinMayCry> @xxmagonx Theres sort of 2, Ones out now, the more more vergil one is out later and has literrally judgment cut end
[0:44:02] <gryffinp> ignore that guy he is being silly
[0:44:03] <%President_Miyazaki> Ignore people telling you to reroll
[0:44:05] <FlamingNarwhal> @PatStaresAt you can switch accounts whenever you want so the original stays
[0:44:07] <%President_Miyazaki> Those people are dumb and crazy
[0:44:07] <+Ancopro> rerollers are the same as those peeps restarting animal crossing
[0:44:08] <%Piemono> Just spend the money and be done with it
[0:44:08] <+LynbellDaYo> Uh, yeah, you would lose your save like that
[0:44:09] <%BinaryFireball> 2 accounts
[0:44:09] <+MelodyMedley> Don't bother with it Pat
[0:44:10] <$TheYharnamTheorem> I don't like anime bullshit, but Genshin is a nice game to passively play while listening/watching something else.
[0:44:14] <%mikessdd> Came out in 2012 originally
[0:44:16] <fuji_92> ignore them
[0:44:19] <$zyberion626> why would he even bother rerolling, chat?
[0:44:20] <+StrawberryPantsu> FUCK
[0:44:21] <%BinaryFireball> can you trade shit in GI?
[0:44:23] <zeif00> It's not going to matter after this stream
[0:44:23] <%blitzrush1200> You don't lose account, just need to redo everything
[0:44:24] <%Farples> It's very good
[0:44:26] <FlamingNarwhal> you keep both accounts chat its really simple
[0:44:26] <+StrawberryPantsu> I NEED TO PLAY THAT GAME NOW
[0:44:32] <+mMayrro> chat is sucrose any good I just got her
[0:44:34] <Lucasleonava> @SaiyanShoto Agreed
[0:44:34] <%Farples> I finished it the other day and was blown away
[0:44:36] <%Bailey__gaming> @saiyanshoto Beidou is the fucking best
[0:44:40] <Louie_Salmon> @azuregale Her R2 move is so damn good, even just for exploring. Also her name is Kek and she goes nya sometimes. Extremely glad she was in my first roll
[0:44:46] <%DEETRz> dungeons are awful lately
[0:44:47] <+OwlLightningMage> I love how much Pat talked it up and yet hasn't finished it LUL
[0:44:49] <%Garthunox> it's so good, I finished it last night, strong contender for my goty

[0:51:16] <%SvenHolgersson> doodLewd
[0:51:17] <Arth__> @PatStaresAt hit AR 20 before update 1.1 and you get barbara the best healer
[0:51:17] <DevinMayCry> @Invlux Except full online lobbies but then you all are out at once
[0:51:17] <%AngriestAngryArtist> the depth comes from the element combis
[0:51:18] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @SoFarFetched HEY! I dont do lewd messages much... wait do i? Am I LEWD?!!!!!!1
[0:51:18] <%SwdVengeance> You can get Marvel level of combos going though with the right team. There's some genuine depth to switching.
[0:51:18] <+Mushinronja> Noelle best girl
[0:51:19] <otakon17> also, Maid has the biggest sword
[0:51:20] <Tomschiii> i still like razor the most
[0:51:22] <Solidnick18> i got her first
[0:51:22] <KoryMccool> throw kaeya in a furnace
[0:51:24] <doublinsux> Honkai Third Impact is pretty serviceable for an action game
[0:51:24] <mortalmanbaby> everyone gets noelle free
[0:51:24] <%FlakkLIVE> It isn't super in-depth but it's fun doing big damage via the elemental interactions
[0:51:25] <steff_mcbee> I feel like "more than I thought it'd be" sums up literally every element of this game, it's shockingly passionate
[0:51:26] <$BoxNavy> kaeya is good
[0:51:27] <+beardedjho> are you running an emulator or phone stream.
[0:51:28] <mortalmanbaby> not free
[0:51:28] <+melanthia_> i think a lot more of the depth comes from the switching between elemental abilities and characters mid battle
[0:51:29] <Djinnazz> all short swords?
[0:51:29] <Louie_Salmon> @reavingd00m You can climb any wall and glide with stamina
[0:51:30] <Solidnick18> noelle does speeeeeeen
[0:51:30] <katocrimson> why no LIsa nee-san?
[0:51:33] <gryffinp> You're 100% guaranteed to get noelle on the first lootbox roll you do on the beginner thing
[0:51:33] <+Ancopro> Daruk
[0:51:36] <+xeros720> noelle can also heal
[0:51:37] <vVAstrAVv> its pronounced like xianling pat
[0:51:38] <mortalmanbaby> HSIED DOES DAMAGE
[0:51:38] <%ashenfrenzy> I love Noel for her heal

[0:51:56] <%Falilth> @beardedjho its on pc
[0:51:56] <%Gogogolem> Noelle is considered top tier cause of that shield

[0:53:58] <jorniev> IM HERE
[0:54:00] <+Pyroclase> Man, I love exaggerated spellcasting animations
[0:54:00] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Hot but bad fighter
[0:54:01] <+gustavozxd> the fact that even the animations are different is crazy
[0:54:01] <+CookieCutter007> SUCC
[0:54:06] <otakon17> damn even the combat animations are unique
[0:54:07] <%PanicSwytch> So is this game online only? Can it offline?
[0:54:08] <+xeros720> hold attack for a different move too
[0:54:09] <jorniev> SO whats happening
[0:54:10] <+SilverDevilfish> succrose
[0:54:13] <otakon17> everyone has their own flaire
[0:54:15] <%Garthunox> They say you attract what you fear, OH NO MOMMY MILKIES AHHHHH
[0:54:17] <%DedlokPM> Beidou is my favorite design.
[0:54:19] <ShinMaddrox> Stack 3 tags and she does more damage with the story.
[0:54:20] <LoneFonte> @PanicSwytch online only
[0:54:20] <%toastybites> lisa can sort of warp dodge too
[0:54:22] <+BigBruthaThunda> I've had the most fun with Amber so far
[0:54:23] <Jrocy247> I like how the sky changes when she does that
[0:54:23] <%SaiyanShoto> Beidou got better titties
[0:54:24] <Zayasu> @PanicSwytch online only
[0:54:25] <Admiral_PopnFresh> This feels veeeeeeeery Warframe
[0:54:26] <steff_mcbee> The character animations are downright lavish
[0:54:27] <+LynbellDaYo> @PanicSwytch Online only
[0:54:28] <nailwind> milk mom so strong the entire world goes dark
[0:54:28] <SPidERMan8576> Lisa runs the fastest because she has longer legs
[0:54:30] <$BoxNavy> you use the tag to build stacks that make the storm stronger. for lisa
[0:54:31] <Ciglossonjr> Sucrose seems like that miqo'te from the arcanist questline
[0:54:33] <+gustavozxd> i wish i got beidou
[0:54:33] <Jontman42> what's the value to this game and how is it higher than the gacha bullshit aspect
[0:54:34] <mortalmanbaby> wow pat you dont have alot of ppl
[0:54:36] <TheNumberJay42> nothing personal kid
[0:54:37] <otakon17> they even have a tall waifu

[0:54:49] <+TopTierHarley> it is not an mmo
[0:54:51] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Way to haste on slimes
[0:54:51] <$zyberion626> @PatStaresAt did you know this game discriminates against short characters?
[0:54:54] <DevinMayCry> @goatbait No its like BOTW with online
[0:54:55] <gryffinp> @goatbait It's not, you can start co-op sessions though
[0:54:56] <+Harro8> ROLL
[0:54:57] <zeif00> comfy town music
[0:54:57] <%AmericanaRed> LETS START ROLLIN 4Head
[0:54:58] <%AzureGale> This is not an MMO
[0:54:59] <$BoxNavy> not even a one
[0:55:00] <Thirtine> you should go check out liyue!
[0:55:01] <happyfacespam> goatbait no, but there is co-op you can queue for
[0:55:01] <%Garthunox> Is there other players around?
[0:55:02] <%Saltmeisterr> how cute are the slimes
[0:55:03] <jorniev> or nier automata
[0:55:03] <otakon17> also listening to the music on the site to get the game...it's really nice
[0:55:04] <+Ancopro> WHERE
[0:55:05] <DKDiamantes> N O W A Y
[0:55:05] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Where? 4Head
[0:55:05] <CHVMPLOO> this song is great
[0:55:06] <+Jaysky> Except that they literally said they did
[0:55:06] <reonome> start climbing pat
[0:55:07] <+dantegus> go to the island
[0:55:08] <%XeroSigmaPrime> IS THIS BOTW 2?!
[0:55:11] <%Gogogolem> I may have wnet toh hard am rank 23 now
[0:55:11] <Mrrccava> wow this is shameless
[0:55:12] <Solidnick18> travler when he acends gets a wind slash at the end of his
[0:55:12] <$Skelemungus> i dont see any
[0:55:12] <Louie_Salmon> @jontman42 Exploring is fun, lots of stuff to find, generous enough with the gacha
[0:55:13] <+NitronStreams> Not a single BOTW
[0:55:13] <%blitzrush1200> Nope, don't see it at all
[0:55:14] <+xeros720> go down there
[0:55:14] <$RealThiele> legally distinct of the wild
[0:55:15] <Lucasleonava> This game has music
[0:55:15] <+Harro8> Check out Liyue harbor bottom left
[0:55:15] <zeif00> legally distinct
[0:55:15] <Ookamiden02> this game feels a lot like an MMORPG
[0:55:15] <$zyberion626> @PatStaresAt movement speed is based around character height so smaller characters are slightly slower
[0:55:16] <jorniev> wet
[0:55:16] <nailwind> the music is great
[0:55:16] <%BubbaRands> Completely it’s own game
[0:55:16] <%cowardman93> didnt the dev say they took heavy inspiration from BOTW
[0:55:17] <%toastybites> except the devs said they did
[0:55:18] <giogio346> free gacha game better than marvels avengers 4Head
[0:55:18] <gryffinp> @otakon17 This game got good musics.
[0:55:19] <TheNumberJay42> noelle is literally a 2b reskin
[0:55:22] <DevinMayCry> Sure is
[0:55:23] <$valkuma> this is breath of the wild if the combat didnt make you cringe
[0:55:23] <$BoxNavy> that is a big monstar
[0:55:24] <%goatbait> BOTW with miltiplayer elements, got it
[0:55:26] <+DrT0M_> @PatStaresAt did you roll for Socruse or whatever her name was? or did you get her through the story?
[0:55:28] <%AmericanaRed> MUSIC A+
[0:55:29] <+TopTierHarley> there is a chest at the spawn of the game @PatStaresAt
[0:55:29] <+TheNeonGraveyard> definitely not a paraglider
[0:55:30] <+twohitgood> dragon quest and breath of the wild.
[0:55:31] <Solidnick18> monstar
[0:55:32] <+Jaysky> They did cowardman93
[0:55:32] <nailwind> bulbasaur slime
[0:55:32] <mortalmanbaby> ok pat you havent been playing this no way
[0:55:33] <%AzureGale> Genshin Impact X Space Jam confirmed
[0:55:34] <+Taglog7> breath of the what
[0:55:35] <+melanthia_> tbh i wish it looked different because the gameplay is way different and better than botw imo
[0:55:35] <+Pyroclase> this game has some really good chill JRPG energy
[0:55:36] <steff_mcbee> @jontman42 so far it's actually apparently pretty easy to roll characters with ingame currency, without buying anything, but who knows if they'll fuck with those metrics once the release hype passes

[0:58:40] <%President_Miyazaki> Yeah, until someone shocks you
[0:58:40] <franctastic_> @marktarkus In Automata you have more emphasis on movement and you kind of can cancel any move with dash, Genshin feels a little like that, even the feel when you hit stuff feels like Automata
[0:58:41] <fehraf> yes the blonde one is a dude
[0:58:41] <happyfacespam> Pyro does nothing until it interacts with another element

[0:59:38] <%ThePushaMan> why is this game free
[0:59:38] <%BubbaRands> Babyyyyyyy

[0:59:46] <1matheuw> wehn other bebe?
[0:59:48] <%DedlokPM> @Owkono $Free.99* (plus some gacha microtransactions)
[0:59:48] <+TopTierHarley> cause it's a gacha
[0:59:55] <SilverSnowFFXIV> Its very mild.
[0:59:56] <Solidnick18> but gacha
[0:59:56] <+NitronStreams> even as I watch I still dont believe that this game is somehow actually good
[0:59:57] <Jontman42> how many hot gay anime boys are there
[1:00:00] <%cvp5127> is there multiplayer or crossplay?
[1:00:02] <KoryMccool> @pat did you see the supposedly leaked patch notes that seem to imply every 10 roll will let us choose a charecter in 1.1
[1:00:02] <%FlakkLIVE> The gacha is brutal. Weapons and Units being in one pool is definitely the worst of it
[1:00:03] <%MonsterEnvy> Gacha is not very bad
[1:00:04] <+CookieCutter007> Where's the free money
[1:00:05] <LoneFonte> @messiahprinny its a pretty game, so people may spend to get their HD Waifus

[1:01:40] <exack> @KoryMccool There aren't good sources on it, so I would put no stock in it. Also, it's way too generous
[1:01:41] <fuji_92> 1:1 is bad yeah
[1:01:42] <revoltingimp> Could we just get a guy that doesn't look like a goddamn twink
[1:01:44] <otakon17> SO Primogems are earnable premium currency
[1:01:45] <DevinMayCry> Yeah its bad
[1:01:46] <+mythmonster2> why not just give you primogens?
[1:01:49] <Matermind0> WTF
[1:01:50] <+immortanjoestar> has pat spent money on this game yet?
[1:01:54] <CappuccinoGuil> Are the crystals the gacha box?
[1:01:55] <DevinMayCry> The free drawing? Not the worst though just takes a bit
[1:01:57] <%templar010> I hate this on controller
[1:01:58] <+Rakenshin> Is this game good or bad? I can't tell
[1:02:00] <+Jaysky> @revoltingimp No :)

[1:02:23] <scrublord009> I am playing for free
[1:02:24] <+LynbellDaYo> @mythmonster2 you can spend genesis crystals on bundles in the shop, that are absolutely not worth it
[1:02:25] <otakon17> Elmo is playing with Gief
[1:02:28] <%backfire_shot> love on pee baby make him happy
[1:02:29] <+Yakobro> MEOW
[1:02:29] <FlamingNarwhal> @Rakenshin good game with a bad gacha. but you can totally ignore the gacha if you want to and you'll be totally fine
[1:02:32] <TheViltsuZ> @Rakenshin It's good, just don't spend too much money
[1:02:32] <+Jaysky> Rakenshin it's good for a free game. Combat is solid, exploration is nice, enviromental interactions are cool. It's still gacha though.

[1:04:23] <%LailahQueenx> it sure is. I'm still confused
[1:04:24] <+Taglog7> was that a guy?
[1:04:25] <%Nordguy> oh i am gonna DELETE THIS OFF MY PHONE
[1:04:25] <otakon17> dat Elmo protesting
[1:04:26] <Alzero83> MATH!?!?!? im outta here...
[1:04:26] <DayDayMaccin1> Nope I'm good
[1:04:26] <%scrumbotime> God I LOVE Three Levels Of Hidden Obfuscation!
[1:04:27] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> i sure love those funbux
[1:04:29] <+gustavozxd> @Yakobro where did you get that info?
[1:04:29] <Alzero83> LUL
[1:04:30] <$Invlux> fucking what
[1:04:31] <sendart> what the hell is with all the different currencies types
[1:04:32] <+TopTierHarley> never roll on the standard banner
[1:04:33] <%maenos2> god this is hurting my head
[1:04:34] <+NitronStreams> God fucking damn it
[1:04:36] <Utible> @BoxNavy there's nothing wrong with singles at all tho
[1:04:36] <fuji_92> mathing it up
[1:04:36] <%BubbaRands> That is disgusting the gameplay is good tho
[1:04:36] <Skatedeandre> one is only good for banner
[1:04:37] <TheViltsuZ> How much space does the game take on PC?
[1:04:38] <gryffinp> So yeah the moral of the story is play daily and don't spend money.
[1:04:39] <Thirtine> its really not as bad as youre making it out to be, at least in the early game
[1:04:41] <MyNameIsRasus> what
[1:04:43] <exack> @disflipmat Currently there is one focus banner, the other is just everything up for grabs
[1:04:43] <steff_mcbee> deliberately obfuscated, the value of your fake currency is at the company's discretion
[1:04:44] <$Invlux> no :)
[1:04:45] <%cvp5127> are there character stories?
[1:04:46] <%SirGO0SE> psaUp
[1:04:46] <@commanderclaw> no
[1:04:47] <+mikesapartment> game is 12 gigs
[1:04:48] <+xeros720> you said that weirdly, but yeah
[1:04:50] <+mythmonster2> so can you play this game free or do you have to pay to win?
[1:04:51] <%PanicSwytch> IM ALREADY LOST
[1:04:54] <+SilverDevilfish> Pink Horrors and Blue Horors got ya
[1:04:54] <+AMagicalFlute> Is it weird I figured this out immediately
[1:04:55] <+Jaysky> I have no idea what's going on
[1:04:56] <TheViltsuZ> Thanks
[1:04:57] <tactician0> I do this shit daily
[1:05:01] <+NitronStreams> I stoppef following an hour ago
[1:05:03] <+TopTierHarley> @Thirtine I agree, he's confusing them for no reason
[1:05:07] <FlamingNarwhal> @mythmonster2 you can play free totally fine
[1:05:08] <Zayasu> can you start again from the beginning BibleThump
[1:05:09] <+Necayde> @Louie_Salmon Xiangling, traveler, noelle and barbara
[1:05:09] <zeif00> Special Banner and Base Banner
[1:05:10] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @mythmonster2 its gacha, its going to be p2w by nature
[1:05:10] <scrublord009> just dont pay, I am not
[1:05:13] <TheNumberJay42> wtf is stardust/glitter
[1:05:13] <trueGarnish> prime-o
[1:05:14] <+Taglog7> NotLikeThis
[1:05:15] <%AmericanaRed> I'm happy with my free rolls
[1:05:16] <nailwind> @mythmonster2 free. pay only if you want a cuter character
[1:05:20] <ShinMaddrox> You are guaranteed a 4 star or greater on a 10 roll. A single roll has no such thing.
[1:05:20] <+TopTierHarley> You only use stardust exchange
[1:05:21] <phoenix7240> this makes me happy that fgos system is so streight foward
[1:05:21] <+Puppet88> im completely lost
[1:05:21] <+flexin_apex> Professor pat I’m listening
[1:05:22] <myfaceisapotato> it's gambling but with enough steps to confuse boomer lawyers
[1:05:23] <SilverSnowFFXIV> So slow I forget what he was trying to explain.
[1:05:23] <+EmiinV> tldr 1600 gems for a 10 roll it ain't that complicated
[1:05:23] <gryffinp> @mythmonster2 it's too soon to say if f2p play will fall off horribly but so far it doesn't seem hard to keep up
[1:05:24] <+Harro8> Its not that complicated/
[1:05:26] <TheViltsuZ> This game and the upcoming Wukong game show that China has massive potential when it comes to games.
[1:05:27] <%AzureGale> Fate/Wish Waifu
[1:05:28] <CappuccinoGuil> How do you get Wishes?
[1:05:29] <%LailahQueenx> NotLikeThis
[1:05:31] <+LynbellDaYo> To explain that better, lol, the plain blue ones are for a banner that lasts indefinitely with every character in a standard pool. The pink ones are for banners with promoted characters, like Venti.
[1:05:34] <Vyskus> Blorb
[1:05:34] <TheNumberJay42> also rolling once is never a good idea
[1:05:35] <%BubbaRands> @scrublord009 BUT WAIFUS THO
[1:05:37] <Thirtine> @TopTierHarley right? and you can get some characters for free by doing their story quests
[1:05:38] <Wauxx00> I already rolled for like 50 wishes without paying anything 🤷
[1:05:40] <Drigoooooo> Other Gacha games a way more straightforward than this lol just take my money
[1:05:45] <Solidnick18> get some maths
[1:05:48] <+Akizea> theres a lot of overexplaining going on here lol
[1:05:50] <+Taglog7> will this be on the exam?
[1:05:52] <quietshun> You usually don't
[1:05:54] <Explodincatz> i hate this
[1:05:55] <0rond> @PatStaresAt don't you need a calculator for ffxiv too
[1:05:57] <Arth__> @PatStaresAt you get Barbara @ AR20 if you hit AR 20 before update 1.1
[1:06:04] <%NeoCre> Not even FGO is this scummy
[1:06:04] <fuji_92> u don't really need, but sure
[1:06:05] <MasterTonberry23> cant i just buy a character i want directly? ahahaha NOPE
[1:06:05] <%ThePushaMan> i quit my download
[1:06:07] <+NitronStreams> theres a reason I refuse to touch gacha games
[1:06:07] <trueGarnish> but is it fun?
[1:06:11] <%BaddonsBadAt> you're guaranteed a 4 star every 10 summons regardless of bulk or single, as far as I'm aware.
[1:06:12] <Skatedeandre> i dont get why theres 3 levels of currency altering
[1:06:13] <+TopTierHarley> @Thirtine yea he's doing too much
[1:06:14] <%BubbaRands> NOT EVEN 20
[1:06:14] <FlamingNarwhal> @TheNumberJay42 rolling once is fine game tracks single rolls you give you guaranteed 4* just like a ten roll
[1:06:18] <Thirtine> ive already rolled like 10 times just by playing, no money spent
[1:06:21] <Jetsfantasy> 18 rolls for $5 though?
[1:06:22] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah I've done like 40 rolls 15 hours in, it could be worse
[1:06:22] <mr_gunn> Travis Scott burger
[1:06:22] <quietshun> It's really not that complicated
[1:06:22] <nintega010> @Arth__ I already got her
[1:06:24] <+chrishnaw> What if I just want to play the video game?
[1:06:25] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Most gacha have 2-3 currencies. This is excessive
[1:06:26] <$BoxNavy> B I G
[1:06:26] <%Spyke889> @ShinMaddrox from everything ive been reading into the pity system takes single rolls into account
[1:06:27] <gryffinp> Ok he's finally getting to the point
[1:06:28] <%ThePushaMan> if i was able to play this with my friends in mmo format maybe
[1:06:29] <$BoxNavy> H U G E
[1:06:29] <mercado94> Pat you're making it sound more complicated than it actually is
[1:06:29] <LoneFonte> @Wauxx00 yeah, with the gazillion launch bonus, what about when they end
[1:06:30] <+TopTierHarley> you get 81 rolls
[1:06:30] <cerellium> do it coward
[1:06:30] <Solidnick18> i need the drugs
[1:06:32] <TheNumberJay42> oh really thats good to know
[1:06:32] <otakon17> um
[1:06:32] <%AngriestAngryArtist> 140?!?!??!! fakkkkkkkkk
[1:06:33] <scrublord009> The part of this game that I actually hate is the RNG drop rates.
[1:06:33] <otakon17> DOUBLE THAT
[1:06:34] <%AmericanaRed> CAREFUL NOW
[1:06:35] <+TopTierHarley> from that
[1:06:37] <fuji_92> I WANNA GACHA
[1:06:38] <+LynbellDaYo> That tweet was worded strangely, you actually only need to create the account before v1.1 for Barbara
[1:06:39] <wibbwobbler> here we go bro
[1:06:40] <+TopTierHarley> you get 81
[1:06:40] <Solidnick18> inject waifus in me
[1:06:40] <%scrumbotime> It's all jumbled up to be intentially confusing to lure in people who can't process the obfuscation or have gambling problems (or both) to milk out the money. The GAME seems not bad, but the predatory practices are designed to HURT YOU if you fall in that pit.
[1:06:41] <mr_slaide> IT'S LIKE THEY'RE PAYING YOU FOR IT!
[1:06:41] <otakon17> you get a +6480 bonus
[1:06:41] <Hanyusha> two rolls are 7 canabucks
[1:06:42] <+uncannygale> Are the bonuses a limited time thing?
[1:06:43] <CrowbarFacelift> no stop
[1:06:43] <Hanyusha> jesus christ
[1:06:44] <%ShawnTK_> DO IT
[1:06:44] <Jontman42> I don't really care how much money that is, I care how much actual game that is
[1:06:47] <$Invlux> PogChamp
[1:06:47] <$BoxNavy> thats fucking awful
[1:06:48] <+xeros720> first time purchase gives you double the rolls
[1:06:48] <+gustavozxd> that's nothing
[1:06:49] <FlamingNarwhal> @chrishnaw then just play the game. you have no need to every interact with the gacha
[1:06:50] <%PanicSwytch> SO IS THIS GATCHA SIMILAR TO XENOBLADE CHRONICLES 2?
[1:06:50] <$BoxNavy> THATS THE WORST
[1:06:51] <CrazyMedicine> 40 PogChamp
[1:06:53] <reonome> EVERYONE GIVE PAT YOUR MONE- ENERGY
[1:06:53] <+gustavozxd> wtf

[1:06:57] <+TopTierHarley> No you roll 81 times
[1:06:57] <Louie_Salmon> That's really bad, yeah
[1:06:57] <+SilverDevilfish> It's like FREE rolls Kappa
[1:06:57] <Cyberwrisket> thats pretty standard for gacha
[1:06:58] <+Taglog7> PogChamp SingsNote SingsNote
[1:06:58] <+HelloImTom08> DO IT
[1:06:58] <gslayer14> 80 times yeah

[1:06:59] <suikudo> Oh my god
[1:07:00] <Alzero83> Canadian...
[1:07:00] <KeiPrime> oh no, not this again
[1:07:00] <Thirtine> 10 rolls gives you a garunteed 4star character/weapon though
[1:07:01] <%SirGO0SE> holy shit
[1:07:01] <+gustavozxd> that's amazing LUL
[1:07:02] <otakon17> first time purchase gives you double the rolls
[1:07:04] <%AzureGale> @otakon17 That's a one-time purchase bonus
[1:07:05] <Melchior_the_Wise> a little over $3 a roll
[1:07:05] <katocrimson> 1/3 of a PS5
[1:07:05] <Tuna_Can_0> atpCap
[1:07:06] <%ThePushaMan> HOLY SHIT
[1:07:08] <Jetsfantasy> 80 Rolls

[1:07:10] <+TheMorilo> 40? THAT'S VERY POGGERS OF THEM
[1:07:11] <teflonbilly777> 40 times 2
[1:07:11] <+Yakobro> @scrublord009 they're adding things that let you choose characters next patch, will work on stuff you already rolled
[1:07:13] <%Tornix> then you have the pity sytem
[1:07:13] <%MonsterEnvy> 80
[1:07:14] <MyNameIsRasus> And that's half a 5star
[1:07:15] <+0raison> yeah its over 80 cause you get double
[1:07:15] <CrowbarFacelift> that's breakfast
[1:07:15] <%BubbaRands> 4 10 rolls LUL
[1:07:15] <%DedlokPM> @Skatedeandre because the Crystal part is the Premium Currency. The Primogems you can get by just playing and you get a lot of primogems
[1:07:17] <%DEETRz> tree fitty?!
[1:07:17] <%JohnAtDawn> Yeah?
[1:07:18] <+pmtriox> don't spend anything
[1:07:18] <+xeros720> 3.50 CAD
[1:07:18] <+BallerSwagBro9k> BUT WAIFU PAT
[1:07:19] <Wauxx00> Without the 160 primo of the launch I can still roll 50 at lvl 28
[1:07:20] <reonome> who the fuck does single rolls
[1:07:20] <dirtyswampman> lemme get that 3 fitty
[1:07:21] <%MonsterEnvy> 80 rolls not 40
[1:07:21] <Mawarup> so whats the up and up on the anti cheat?
[1:07:23] <$Invlux> That's IF you get the bonus from buying in bulk
[1:07:23] <gryffinp> And yet that's pretty standard for gacha games
[1:07:23] <%JohnAtDawn> That's normal pat
[1:07:24] <Melchior_the_Wise> like like $1.00 US
[1:07:24] <+eanscrale> it's like 2 us
[1:07:24] <+Taglog7> treefiddy???
[1:07:25] <+StrawberryPantsu> So thats like 1 buck american
[1:07:26] <+TopTierHarley> $100 for 81 rolls
[1:07:26] <Melchior_the_Wise> lmao
[1:07:26] <+ApocalypticExpress> 0.6% chance of 5 star is trash by all gacha standards ive seen
[1:07:27] <otakon17> About Tree Fiddy
[1:07:31] <klx5> it's around 2.50 US
[1:07:33] <%AmericanaRed> PAY TO WIN AT A PRICE shibuy4Kirby2
[1:07:33] <teflonbilly777> 80
[1:07:34] <%AzureGale> The highest tier pack is $100 US
[1:07:34] <steff_mcbee> @scrumbotime yeah that's the scummy element, this stuff is outright designed to hook vulnerable people
[1:07:35] <+TinyLittleDancer> I hate to be voice of reason, but nobody do this please
[1:07:36] <leinadtonu> sounds bad
[1:07:37] <%GutsForDinner> TREE FIDDY??
[1:07:39] <@SoFarFetched> That pressure of "First-Time buyer bonus available only once" when the highest option is the best one (but also bad)
[1:07:41] <Melchior_the_Wise> Goddamn LOCHNESS MONSTER
[1:07:41] <Thirtine> its really not, pat
[1:07:44] <Slimeking_Mike> Expect that currency to DRY up
[1:07:44] <otakon17> what can 80 rolls give you though?
[1:07:46] <%GutsForDinner> GODDAMN LOCH NESS MONSHTA
[1:07:47] <+pmtriox> whales are already crazy buying wish rolls
[1:07:47] <MasterTonberry23> i want that green anime husbando but my wallet cant take it
[1:07:48] <fuji_92> three fitty
[1:07:48] <CrowbarFacelift> that's a bagel and coffee
[1:07:50] <exack> @PatStaresAt With the bonus on the biggest pack you get an extra ten roll, so 50 rolls
[1:07:51] <jorniev> ABOUT THREE FIDDY
[1:07:51] <DartonLance> I'm at about 150ish free rolls off getting to rank 30
[1:07:51] <+Aeonleon> free to pay
[1:07:54] <Louie_Salmon> Are you gonna pull of the odds now?
[1:07:56] <trueGarnish> limesThink
[1:07:56] <teflonbilly777> 40 times 2
[1:07:56] <chaseyd> Hey Pat, wanna know something really fun too?
[1:07:58] <+SilverDevilfish> Yeah because the game is new and they want to get people addicted via that free currency
[1:07:58] <%rdark_ksu> I can get a corn dog for that
[1:08:00] <phoenix7240> i used to think the 1% 5 star rate of fgo was at the bottom of the barrel
[1:08:01] <Jontman42> the fuck you rolling for tho, the hot gay anime boys?
[1:08:01] <chaseyd> I bet you may not know this.
[1:08:02] <%Jaxnos> I came into the stream to see how Pat was enjoying Genshin AND THE FIRST THING I SEE IS HIM ON THE MTX PAGE
[1:08:03] <teflonbilly777> It's half of that
[1:08:04] <+shabop> It's multiple thousands of dollars to max ou a 5 star
[1:08:04] <%MonsterEnvy> Cause it's 80 rolls
[1:08:04] <Skatedeandre> @DedlokPM i get that part but im more asking why theres so many hoops to jump through
[1:08:04] <%JohnAtDawn> Pat that's a perfectly normal price for gacha
[1:08:06] <+MorelK> its 80 rolls
[1:08:07] <+TopTierHarley> 40.5 x 2
[1:08:07] <%MonsterEnvy> not 40
[1:08:09] <+Hokepoke> limesYikes
[1:08:10] <+That1Coward> the perfect game
[1:08:10] <katocrimson> excluding tax and hidden credit card cost
[1:08:10] <DemonioB> breath of the wallet
[1:08:11] <+Ghally> First time purchase double your gems so 80 rolls
[1:08:12] <gslayer14> open your booster packs consumer
[1:08:12] <scrublord009> I JUST LIKE PLAYING THE GAME. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE GATCHA
[1:08:14] <+xeros720> people are just saying there's a first time purchase bonus that doubles
[1:08:17] <gslayer14> do not question
[1:08:18] <steff_mcbee> Kappa
[1:08:18] <@SoFarFetched> Kappa
[1:08:20] <+pmtriox> "perfectly normal" fuck that
[1:08:20] <LunarRemix> It's not.
[1:08:20] <teflonbilly777> YOU GET 80 ROLLS

[1:08:22] <@SoFarFetched> he's got you there
[1:08:23] <takai92> because F**k you thats why
[1:08:24] <+xeros720> pat is right if you pack those gems a 2nd time
[1:08:24] <chaseyd> Do you know what you get at Adventure Rank 20?
[1:08:24] <ShinMaddrox> FGO has some of the worst though
[1:08:25] <%JohnAtDawn> It kinda sounds like you are
[1:08:26] <rei0> no it is fucking not, who said that this is regular on gacha?
[1:08:27] <exack> The times 2 is only the first time. After that you only get a bonus 1600 on the biggest pack
[1:08:27] <LunarRemix> Even compared to other Gachas, it's fucking bad
[1:08:29] <+Ancopro> to groceries
[1:08:31] <%ArchimerCXV> Chat? what about after the frst time?
[1:08:34] <%crimsonharvest> that bonus is only for the first purchase
[1:08:34] <Jontman42> so what you're saying is that gacha is bullshit
[1:08:35] <ammobasket> compared to life
[1:08:36] <+SilverDevilfish> Breath of the Wild
[1:08:37] <otakon17> yeah this looks like a regular vidya
[1:08:37] <+gustavozxd> "perfectly normal" holy shit these people are brainwashed atpCap
[1:08:38] <Mr_Strut> gacha a shit
[1:08:38] <RemnanTaka> FGO is way worse lol
[1:08:39] <teflonbilly777> Pat, it's 80 rolls not 40
[1:08:39] <reonome> reminder you don't actually have to roll to play the game
[1:08:39] <%AngriestAngryArtist> to money for regular shit yeah loo
[1:08:39] <%JohnAtDawn> Well then you're stupid from the start
[1:08:39] <Jetsfantasy> First-time bonus buy before you have to deal with the loch ness gachas
[1:08:40] <fuji_92> to money
[1:08:42] <quietshun> that's your problem
[1:08:43] <Thirtine> you get a ton of primogems just playing the game right now
[1:08:43] <%TheDullaMAN> That first time purchase is only once, though
[1:08:45] <chaseyd> At Adventure Rank 20 you unlock a Battle Pass. c:
[1:08:46] <+TopTierHarley> gacha isn't regular
[1:08:48] <otakon17> it's still a bonus
[1:08:49] <%Maids4lyfe> don't compare it to regular games
[1:08:50] <Solidnick18> i have no idea
[1:08:51] <TheNumberJay42> gotcha gaming Kappa
[1:08:51] <@ShockzNDrawe> NO
[1:08:52] <Hanyusha> omg no lisa in party
[1:08:52] <mortalmanbaby> ok but overwatch is 60 at realse and had boxes
[1:08:53] <mak0t0yukii> Spark is pity
[1:08:55] <%maenos2> sparking is granblue's pity system
[1:08:55] <zeif00> Pity Mechanic
[1:08:56] <otakon17> you can get 80 rolls
[1:08:57] <@ShockzNDrawe> PAT THATS NOT TURE
[1:08:58] <Hanyusha> opinion irrelevant shit taste
[1:08:59] <+NitronStreams> FIRST ONES FREE KIDS
[1:08:59] <+TinyLittleDancer> I hate the notion of "They gave me sixty-blurpty courtesy rolls so that clears them from milking me dry in the long run"
[1:08:59] <%Jay_Squirrel> Jay_Squirrel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! month
[1:09:00] <+TopTierHarley> why are you buying it more than once?
[1:09:00] <scrublord009> @PatStaresAt There are other currencies that are more friendly for free too play.
[1:09:02] <%BubbaRands> That’s just one
[1:09:02] <AwkwardPon> at least compare it to the best gacha game ever, girls frontline, you weebs
[1:09:03] <+TheMorilo> people who bring out the bonus are already got
[1:09:04] <+mashinchaserr> gacha is bad
[1:09:05] <%legendfather_of_giants> @RemnanTaka FGO is not nearly as bad
[1:09:05] <chaseyd> Yup! I just found it crazy that there's a Battle Pass too. lol
[1:09:05] <mr_slaide> What is all that anime bullshit?
[1:09:08] <FlamingNarwhal> battlepass is also SHITS THE PRICE IS SUPER OVERPRICED
[1:09:08] <+amurter19> gacha players think gacha prices are normal
[1:09:09] <+the_krypto_knight> People seem really eager to defend predatory micro transactions
[1:09:09] <DevinMayCry> You can choose a 4 star weapon too
[1:09:11] <%FlakkLIVE> the battle pass doesnt give much premium currency or summons at all
[1:09:11] <exack> @PatStaresAt After the first bonus, you still get an extra 1600 on the highest pack. So 50 rolls
[1:09:12] <DartonLance> Battle pass is kinda bad unless you manage to max it
[1:09:14] <DatAsuna> I didn't have a problem playing honkai without buying gacha, so I don't imagine I'll need to do it in this either. even people insist i should minmax
[1:09:19] <CrowbarFacelift> so when we rollin'
[1:09:21] <+chrishnaw> Does this game have any multiplayer?
[1:09:21] <+earthboy2k> gatcha fans atpCap
[1:09:22] <fuji_92> yeah
[1:09:24] <%ssjklyco> Listen to these chumps justify their gambling habits.
[1:09:26] <Lucasleonava> @legendfather_of_giants No fgo is pretty bad
[1:09:27] <wibbwobbler> this is wild bruh
[1:09:29] <+Link232> You only get 5 rolls from the battlepass, but you need to buy to get the limited roll currency and primogems
[1:09:31] <+archangel9889> this might be a turn off from the game. damn it.
[1:09:32] <Ambiguous_Anti> Look pat you're just not accepting it. Just ACCEPT it. That's ALL you have to do.
[1:09:35] <DatAsuna> @chrishnaw yeah it has co-op
[1:09:36] <Zayasu> cant get my controller to work all of a sudden with this game ResidentSleeper
[1:09:39] <teflonbilly777> Pat doesn't know the value of waifus
[1:09:42] <%AzureGale> That comes out to $2 US for a roll
[1:09:44] <Louie_Salmon> I do appreciate they show the odds so readily
[1:09:44] <%SvenHolgersson> So how good or bad is that in gachas
[1:09:45] <DevinMayCry> @archangel9889 Just play free bro
[1:09:46] <%TheDullaMAN> I WISH FGO had a game that played like this with their rolls.
[1:09:50] <%toastybites> you dont need to roll to play though
[1:09:50] <$Invlux> The bonus for buying in bulk shouldn't factor in to the equation IMO
[1:09:51] <$BoxNavy> its totally possible to go completely free it looks like though
[1:09:56] <+killer_squid1990> VENTI IS REALLY CUTE
[1:09:56] <gryffinp> The mistake everyone is making is that thinking that the gacha matters. Just ignore it and roll whenever you happen to get enough.
[1:09:57] <+TopTierHarley> Yes Pat, this is gacha
[1:09:57] <%JohnAtDawn> I still don't know if these rolls are Singles or Multis
[1:09:58] <Thirtine> you literally dont need to roll at all to play the game well :V
[1:09:59] <+xir0gravity> or you just don't spend money and just use the free rolls you get
[1:10:00] <dirtyswampman> you have a problem if you spend more than a full game on pulls
[1:10:01] <BlkFlameKami> fuck bards
[1:10:01] <%FlakkLIVE> @chrishnaw crossplay for all, cross-save for pc and mobile. ps4 is its own save
[1:10:02] <TheViltsuZ> HE?!
[1:10:02] <+amurter19> this frame rate looks so good compared to ps4 pro
[1:10:02] <%Jaxnos> so when are you gonna start rolling, Pat?
[1:10:02] <%PanicSwytch> Waifu's aren't cheap
[1:10:03] <+Taglog7> HE?!
[1:10:04] <Ciglossonjr> THATS A GUY?!?!
[1:10:05] <otakon17> ...Venti is a guy!?
[1:10:06] <rbakervv> @PatStaresAt but how much money does it cost to just play the game == NOTHING
[1:10:09] <prime_name> ROLL FOR BOI
[1:10:09] <%toastybites> but you don't need Venti though
[1:10:09] <Jetsfantasy> @Zayasu Login with kb/m, hit escape one you're logged in and go to controls. Change to controller
[1:10:10] <+Mrbaconator> HE?!
[1:10:13] <reonome> tfw got all of those girls but not venti
[1:10:13] <Thirtine> fuck yeah venti <3
[1:10:14] <fuji_92> yes he's a he
[1:10:16] <mr_slaide> TRAP
[1:10:17] <Jontman42> oh that's a boy
[1:10:17] <scrublord009> Btw, you don't need new characters to finish the game BUT I UNDERSTAND THE WANT
[1:10:17] <DemonioB> venti 3%?
[1:10:17] <+TopTierHarley> Yes Venti is a guy
[1:10:17] <DatAsuna> @archangel9889 yeah, it's not hard to just not be a whale
[1:10:19] <cherrycottontail> Venti isn't that good, veniti is actually a cheat character
[1:10:19] <+gustavozxd> @Link232 the game is fun even if you ignore this stuff, the main problem is vulnerable people who migh waste money on this
[1:10:19] <DevinMayCry> Ventis a dude yes
[1:10:19] <gryffinp> Venti is in fact a guy, this game is very twink
[1:10:19] <otakon17> THAT IS THE GIRLIEST GUY SINCE FORREST FROM FIRE EMBLEM
[1:10:19] <+Link232> Yeah Venti's a dude
[1:10:20] <+Taglog7> LUL LUL LUL KappaPride KappaPride KappaPride

[1:10:22] <mak0t0yukii> Yes he is he
[1:10:22] <%SvenHolgersson> Venti can be whatever you want when you own him
[1:10:22] <wibbwobbler> very tempting...
[1:10:23] <ShinMaddrox> Is Pat trying to justify his whaling for his Waifu's of the Wild?
[1:10:23] <teflonbilly777> Don't you get a 4 star Venti as part of the story?
[1:10:24] <@ShockzNDrawe> Anyone on the banner is on rate up
[1:10:24] <Jrocy247> Venti's a Femboy
[1:10:25] <%AzureGale> Venti is indeed a dude
[1:10:25] <%SvenHolgersson> doodLewd
[1:10:25] <+TinyLittleDancer> Thats 20 bucks on average for one of them
[1:10:29] <TheViltsuZ> OK I LOVE YOUR GAME NOW

[1:10:53] <+That1Coward> oh pat you are as beautiful as ever
[1:10:54] <rbakervv> @PatStaresAt Can't hear you over usic
[1:10:55] <Zebroneath> big fucking lie
[1:10:55] <+SilverDevilfish> Percentage of a percentage
[1:10:55] <scrublord009> THIS IS THE PROBLEM. THIS PAGE
[1:10:56] <TheViltsuZ> DID YOU JUST ASSUME HIS SEXUALITY?!
[1:10:56] <+mythmonster2> oh man that's manipulative
[1:10:57] <+Axle13j> this part is bullshit
[1:10:58] <+mikesapartment> IT IS NOT 50%
[1:10:58] <Solidnick18> i got barbara
[1:10:59] <Nobuwaroo> well compared to like a card game, buying a booster pack how much is that?
[1:10:59] <rei0> 0.6% is real atrocious on gacha btw
[1:11:00] <+Link232> @gustavozxd Yeah I've had plenty of fun just F2P, but man I've used like 60 rolls entirely from F2P and still 0 Venti so of course it feels bad
[1:11:01] <%SaiyanShoto> I hate when I get an item instead of a character
[1:11:01] <+xeros720> just give uncle pat some time to make sense of all this
[1:11:04] <%BubbaRands> Where’s the rest
[1:11:04] <%AzureGale> HERE IT IS
[1:11:04] <+HelloImTom08> so how much is Pat gonna spend?
[1:11:05] <fuji_92> 50% of 0.6 LUL
[1:11:05] <dimensaur> husbando 5 star
[1:11:08] <Drigoooooo> Yeah that’s just rate up not chance
[1:11:08] <+lethallylactic> 0.6% LUL
[1:11:08] <+MelodyMedley> The actual stats are in the smaller writing
[1:11:10] <$Afterman_> holy shit thats low
[1:11:11] <%cvp5127> LUL
[1:11:11] <TheNumberJay42> is this pats first gacha game this kind of scummy shit is common knowledge
[1:11:14] <%JohnAtDawn> Yeah
[1:11:14] <katocrimson> the percentage message is misleading for people who don't know probabilty
[1:11:15] <Dalthine> Not even 1%. Wow.
[1:11:16] <$BoxNavy> gacha that mix in characters with weapons are the worst dude
[1:11:16] <+LynbellDaYo> 0.6% lmao
[1:11:17] <steff_mcbee> chat gettin' salty about androgynous characters again
[1:11:19] <BoneBagMel> yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyo
[1:11:20] <0rond> ACTUALLY WORSE than fgo
[1:11:20] <%BubbaRands> There’s the real number
[1:11:21] <BlkFlameKami> NINTEY ATTEMPTS LOL
[1:11:21] <0rond> holy sht
[1:11:22] <+LynbellDaYo> LOWER THAN FGO
[1:11:23] <CrowbarFacelift> fuckin' hell
[1:11:23] <%DedlokPM> @Taglog7 @Ciglossonjr @otakon17 yes. Venti is a he
[1:11:25] <RaidenRising> dude
[1:11:26] <DevinMayCry> Thats not t-oh you corrected
[1:11:27] <%ArchimerCXV> yeah slamm a couple of 00past the decimal gatcha, that'll help, holy shit
[1:11:27] <Mrrashie> BRUUUUUUUH
[1:11:29] <Mr_Strut> 90
[1:11:29] <warmnoid> BRAVO LMAO
[1:11:30] <%Lunaticbro > i think that is the worst 5 star rate i have ever seen in a gacha
[1:11:31] <otakon17> ...you need to spend OVER $140 TO GET A FIVE STAR GUARANTEED
[1:11:31] <+xeros720> you really don't want to a phrase like "consolidated probability" outside of a math class
[1:11:33] <Thirtine> lmaoooo
[1:11:34] <DatAsuna> Pat, that's not how percentages work
[1:11:34] <$Afterman_> even DOTA2 has better escalating odds than this
[1:11:34] <Ambiguous_Anti> Oh so it's hearthstone
[1:11:34] <%ThePushaMan> 90?
[1:11:35] <+mashinchaserr> isn't fgo .01%
[1:11:35] <dukeoftime> Ninety!?
[1:11:36] <Bloodhit> Pity 5 star Pog
[1:11:37] <%BubbaRands> LOWER THAN FGO
[1:11:37] <iosephe> wow that's some shit
[1:11:37] <+pectusumbra> sparking
[1:11:37] <+Pobega> only $250?!?! such a deal
[1:11:37] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt IIRC .6% includes weapons
[1:11:38] <flatty1000> >90
[1:11:38] <mak0t0yukii> LUL
[1:11:39] <+HelloImTom08> 90 per banner btw
[1:11:39] <+i_like_my_swords_great> Don't forget you need dupes of the characters as well
[1:11:39] <MasterTonberry23> wait people think Venti's a girl?
[1:11:40] <trueGarnish> LUL
[1:11:42] <mercado94> So like any other gacha
[1:11:42] <%DEETRz> you need dupes of each character too to fully unlock their abilities
[1:11:42] <BoneBagMel> fuck that
[1:11:44] <+gustavozxd> @Link232 yep that's how they get people, and the ones who won't ever spend money usually just give up
[1:11:44] <+pmtriox> meaning they'll front load the fuck outta you
[1:11:46] <steff_mcbee> NotLikeThis
[1:11:46] <+flexin_apex> I’m failing this exam for sure
[1:11:46] <%ChrisAlgoo> bless china's gacha laws
[1:11:46] <RaidenRising> holy jesus
[1:11:47] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt the way gacha is formatted is that they give you enough free rolls from grinding to get a good roster but the PREY on Addicts to overspend on characters they want
[1:11:50] <+Link232> 90 attempts to guarentee a 5 star, but you still have a 50% chance not to get Venti, it's 180 rolls to guarantee the rate-up character
[1:11:50] <+That1Coward> LUL
[1:11:51] <%MonsterEnvy> You don't need to pay anything
[1:11:51] <%cvp5127> only 90 PogChamp
[1:11:51] <otakon17> Venti looks like a girl!
[1:11:51] <+BallerSwagBro9k> UP TO 90 ATTEMPTS
[1:11:52] <klx5> no you gotta double that
[1:11:52] <%Jaxnos> people do single rolls?
[1:11:52] <%Zundelle> 90 attempts at a 50% chance at getting Venti
[1:11:52] <%bluetocho13> nah FGO is >07
[1:11:52] <%legendfather_of_giants> @mashinchaserr nah, 1%
[1:11:53] <Solidnick18> what a steal
[1:11:54] <+Ancopro> become as whale
[1:11:55] <%AlteisenReiseZ> THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T PLAY A GACHA WITHOUT A SPARK SYSTEM. Why I always stick with Granblue.'
[1:11:55] <DatAsuna> There's literally no such thing as guarunteeing a % chance
[1:11:56] <Zoh87> I got a 5 star on the first beginner one lmao
[1:11:56] <exack> FGO is 1% for a 5 star character, .7% is the rate up
[1:11:56] <+michingmallecho> Oh my
[1:11:56] <%GutsForDinner> 200$ to guarantee the five star roll
[1:11:59] <gslayer14> this makes actual gambling seem reasonable in comparison
[1:11:59] <alphonseisbest> @mashinchaserr NO fgo is %1
[1:11:59] <mak0t0yukii> Fgo is more cruel i think
[1:11:59] <%AlphaTauri> But Pat, I can get a 5 Star first try
[1:12:00] <klx5> 50% chance of getting him
[1:12:00] <%TheDullaMAN> Unfortunately, though, FGO doesn't have a gurantee.
[1:12:01] <%MonsterEnvy> GOod chance you will get this stuff just playing
[1:12:02] <%JohnAtDawn> @MasterTonberry23 .7 for a rate up 5^
[1:12:02] <%AmericanaRed> LIFE IS A MYSTERY shibuy4Conan
[1:12:03] <+chrishnaw> So this game is better than FGO in every way?
[1:12:04] <Tuna_Can_0> distStudy will this be on the test
[1:12:05] <+BigBruthaThunda> I am wrong for being fine with the 4 starters?
[1:12:06] <+TheSaintJohn> 200 for anime jpeg
[1:12:08] <+BallerSwagBro9k> I got Venti on 70th attempt
[1:12:09] <otakon17> You can get 80 rolls on your first $140 pass
[1:12:09] <Hanyusha> 90 rolls is 225 dollaridoos
[1:12:10] <fuji_92> two hundo for your husbando
[1:12:10] <%GutsForDinner> or $4.99 for Vergil DLC
[1:12:11] <+Lexiellent> I did 3 10 rolls got Venti, Jean, and the stringless bow in one pull and just stopped
[1:12:11] <Drigoooooo> It’s a pretty low rate compared to other Gacha games
[1:12:12] <Mrrashie> monkaW
[1:12:13] <ShinMaddrox> Does that Guarantee go away if you manage to pull a 5 star before the 90 pulls?
[1:12:16] <+Dre_> But Pat i want Jean though
[1:12:17] <$BoxNavy> thats why i say save the currency for 10 rolls
[1:12:20] <%DedlokPM> @MasterTonberry23 To be fair I thought he was a girl as well until I played the first Closed Beta back in June 2019
[1:12:21] <DevinMayCry> 4 stars are good in game too chat
[1:12:21] <+TopTierHarley> @BigBruthaThunda nah the 4 stars are good
[1:12:21] <Lucasleonava> Fgo dont have guarantee 5 star
[1:12:22] <+OwlLightningMage> It sounds like you just shouldn't play the game or genre
[1:12:22] <%Spyke889> @PatStaresAt as a guy who has whaled in a few gachas everything your saying is true. unless you have a decent expendable income I would say never do more than the 5$ monthly bundles
[1:12:24] <otakon17> per 10 attempts is WAY better
[1:12:26] <KaiserMario> Sooo... U$ 200.00 per 5 star character... WOW, WHAT A DEAL
[1:12:26] <VritraReiRei> @mashinchaserr fgo is 1% for a 5 Star, 70% of that is the Rate-up character usually
[1:12:26] <LunarRemix> Not once every 10, if you do a ten you get a 4*, not individually
[1:12:27] <%Jubelaious> even if f/go has better gacha rates it has no spark
[1:12:28] <DevinMayCry> One of the strongest characters in game is a 4 star
[1:12:28] <flatty1000> so why isn't this gambling?
[1:12:30] <%legendfather_of_giants> @ShinMaddrox yes
[1:12:31] <sendart> this is some bad civ
[1:12:32] <+gustavozxd> I can't believe dead or alive venus vacation has better chances than this LUL
[1:12:34] <andimustmask> @PatStaresAt lest ye get sidetracked bitching about standard gacha, the game itself is actually fun to play, without pulling a single time
[1:12:36] <%barkon345> barkon345 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 14 month streak! Heyyyy Pat. why you got to make the message highlight so expensive that's almost all my points for one. also how come you or Woolie haven't checked out Daemon X Machina? I figured you guys being such huge Mech fans you would have been all over that game.
[1:12:36] <Jontman42> I don't think the hot gay anime boys are worth it
[1:12:38] <LorcaNomad> my buddy got 2 five stars in his first pull
[1:12:40] <+SilverDevilfish> It is gambling
[1:12:42] <TheViltsuZ> @TheSaintJohn You play them in the 3D game though.
[1:12:42] <Drigoooooo> And FGO rates are garbage so comparing the two is not good
[1:12:48] <Louie_Salmon> Oh really?
[1:12:48] <fuji_92> I actually got jean as my 5 star in venti banner
[1:12:48] <MasterTonberry23> Its not gambling its surprise mechanics Kappa
[1:12:49] <ikantreeed> Of course i BS it's gatcha. the game is great tho
[1:12:51] <Hanyusha> yeah fgo and bleach 10 rolls - guarantee

[1:12:55] <+TopTierHarley> Nice Lorca
[1:12:55] <gryffinp> @flatty1000 Because even if you win you only get an anime character, instead of money

[1:13:07] <+SilverDevilfish> Gacha is loot boxes
[1:13:07] <exack> Gacha is high key gambling
[1:13:07] <+Link232> The ONE arguement that it's not gambling is that you're guaranteed to get anything: it's a SHIT argument, but it's the one they're sticking to

[1:13:41] <+TinyLittleDancer> Pat is roughly correct with percentages, just do a quick probability of series for independent events
[1:13:41] <+pmtriox> its actually worse than gambling, because you assume they don't fudge the numbers as you roll them

[1:13:51] <+LynbellDaYo> to pressure you, lol
[1:13:52] <+Link232> Wrong again, only guarentees a 5 star
[1:13:56] <Louie_Salmon> Well no, it's still 50%
[1:13:58] <JakeSG> no it's only 50%
[1:13:59] <+Necayde> drops to 50 for pity in 1.1
[1:14:01] <heuristicfailure> Wrong
[1:14:02] <+elcapitanspider> BUT 80 PULLS THO- chat LUL
[1:14:02] <+Link232> 180 rolls guarantee you Venti, 90 rolls only guarantee you a 5 star
[1:14:04] <+deviljhojho_> what the fuck is a gacha anyawys
[1:14:04] <+HelloImTom08> its not a guarantee tho LUL
[1:14:06] <beatie_g> it's worse than gambling because you cant even make money off it
[1:14:06] <flatty1000> so its as buyout
[1:14:06] <cherrycottontail> The limited banners actually have better % than the normal one
[1:14:06] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt guarantees A 5-star, not Venti
[1:14:06] <trueGarnish> aw jeez rick
[1:14:08] <klx5> yeah
[1:14:09] <%ShawnTK_> only guarantees a 5 star, you got a 50% chance tho
[1:14:09] <LunarRemix> Yeah
[1:14:09] <heuristicfailure> 180 to ensure it
[1:14:10] <+killer_squid1990> 180 is guaranteed banner
[1:14:11] <pixelkenj> did you say 90
[1:14:12] <%linSP> No it’s 50% for venti after 90
[1:14:12] <%Spyke889> @PatStaresAt not true i pulled diluc of venti banner
[1:14:13] <klx5> at worst you have to roll 180 times
[1:14:14] <1matheuw> holeeshit
[1:14:14] <DevinMayCry> @Link232 You are garunteed the character in the next 90 pull
[1:14:16] <nintega010> I'm just going for Jean
[1:14:17] <gryffinp> I still object philosophically, neither gacha nor lootbox is "gambling" because "gambling" is games of chance with the intent to actually make money.
[1:14:18] <+JohnXuandou> it's a 50% that your guaranteed 5 star will be Venti
[1:14:19] <%DEETRz> the second time it'd be guaranteed to be venti
[1:14:19] <BanSenpai> i've seen ppl spend more and not get venti
[1:14:19] <mak0t0yukii> LUL
[1:14:19] <Pyon84> LUL
[1:14:20] <DevinMayCry> 180 is the minimum
[1:14:20] <cheapdoc> That's the brand
[1:14:20] <+jiggy_snipe> damn this crazy talk
[1:14:20] <%AzureGale> It's 180 at most, which is still p bad
[1:14:21] <Jetsfantasy> It's a 50% chance to get him
[1:14:21] <+gustavozxd> @pmtriox yeah that's the thing I've always wondered about, how do we even know they're not just lying
[1:14:21] <+TopTierHarley> Yea the standard banner sucks, never pull there
[1:14:22] <+Ancopro> its 50% of a guarenteed 5 star
[1:14:22] <1matheuw> that burn tho
[1:14:22] <BlkFlameKami> damn paige
[1:14:23] <+pectusumbra> 50% the first time, the 2nd time for sure if you didn't get it
[1:14:23] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> N-nailed it...?
[1:14:23] <suikudo> WHOS TALKING
[1:14:25] <Jontman42> that's Pat
[1:14:26] <+rando_0268> It will be a 5 start with a 50% chance to be venti
[1:14:26] <JakeSG> look at the top
[1:14:26] <TheNumberJay42> lmao after 90 rolls its only a 50% chance
[1:14:27] <%AlphaTauri> LUL
[1:14:27] <MasterTonberry23> quiet paige the adults are talking
[1:14:27] <fuji_92> LUL
[1:14:28] <heuristicfailure> It's even worse
[1:14:28] <+pmtriox> its chances on top of chances
[1:14:28] <ScreamLord> The BIG budle of crystals is 100 USD, ugh
[1:14:29] <+HelloImTom08> there is NO guarantee LUL
[1:14:29] <RayCSmooth> there's other 5 star in there
[1:14:29] <+JohnXuandou> you are guaranteed a 5 star, you are not guaranteed the banner character
[1:14:30] <+MelodyMedley> LUL
[1:14:30] <%weissguard> LUL
[1:14:30] <%DEETRz> DOUBLE
[1:14:31] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Why does an Irishman want Venti?
[1:14:32] <+LynbellDaYo> 90 rolls for guaranteed 5 stars, then another for guaranteed Venti
[1:14:33] <%linSP> You have to roll 180 times for 100%
[1:14:35] <Jontman42> good job Paige
[1:14:37] <%scrumbotime> You *will* get a 5 star, it might not be Starbucks

[1:14:40] <MyNameIsRasus> BABY A DOUBLE
[1:14:44] <trueGarnish> this hurts
[1:14:45] <+chrishnaw> Venti's a bitch anyway
[1:14:45] <DemonioB> fucking venti
[1:14:46] <night__monkey> Pat you are not doing a very good job at making me want to play this
[1:14:46] <DevinMayCry> A coin flip determiones if you pay double
[1:14:48] <otakon17> God can you imagine how good this game would be WITHOUT the Gacha pulls?
[1:14:49] <RaidenRising> lul
[1:14:49] <teflonbilly777> You can probably buy Venti in the store with Stardust Glitter after when that event is over too
[1:14:50] <Tuna_Can_0> Everything you say is wrong, but is not incorrect Kappa
[1:14:50] <Hanyusha> ha ha it's actually worse
[1:14:51] <mortalmanbaby> guess what i pulled venti first time soooo
[1:14:51] <+EmiinV> it aint'g reat
[1:14:52] <ELkasle> no its not guarantee, its 2 chances of 50% and not 100%
[1:14:53] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> O F H
[1:14:53] <%TheDullaMAN> Sweet baby Jesus...
[1:14:54] <otakon17> ...why would you need 180?
[1:14:54] <%MonsterEnvy> You don't have buy anything
[1:14:55] <ikantreeed> I had him on 14 pulls i think
[1:14:56] <gslayer14> console or Venti
[1:14:57] <ammobasket> within 14 days ;)
[1:14:57] <1matheuw> 600 dollar for a videogame character
[1:14:57] <%Jubelaious> 180 is the maximum. Theoretically if you get super lucky and pull a 5* after 10 pulls, the next one you get is 100% venti
[1:14:57] <+gustavozxd> cancel your ps5 preorder guys LUL
[1:14:57] <+BallerSwagBro9k> PAT WERE GACHA LORDS WE KNOW ALL THIS. WE JUST PULL
[1:14:58] <gslayer14> pick one
[1:15:00] <+pmtriox> preach brother
[1:15:00] <TheNumberJay42> 600 bux for a boy that looks like a girl
[1:15:00] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt plus however many dupes you want
[1:15:00] <otakon17> you need at least 90.
[1:15:01] <reonome> venti sucks anyway lmao
[1:15:02] <+D00msDayDan> despair
[1:15:03] <TheNix> I appreciate this, Pat
[1:15:03] <@SoFarFetched> If anything he's telling us why to NOT spend money on this.
[1:15:04] <katocrimson> it's 100% 5 star but 50 % venti if 90 rolls on that banner
[1:15:04] <KaiserMario> But what if I reaaaaaaally want Venti?
[1:15:04] <+xeros720> yeah, they aren't paying pat
[1:15:05] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I respect that
[1:15:05] <%cvp5127> only 180 PogChamp
[1:15:05] <otakon17> He's the ONLY five star.
[1:15:05] <RaidenRising> big off
[1:15:06] <+Link232> It's an amazing game, but you *have* to god damn trash the gacha
[1:15:08] <%JohnAtDawn> That's nice, you're wrong.
[1:15:08] <+HelloImTom08> meh, games fun tho
[1:15:08] <+pmtriox> DO NOT PAY A CENT
[1:15:08] <+TopTierHarley> Imagine people not knowing what a gacha is
[1:15:10] <%MonsterEnvy> Well you don't need to buy anything
[1:15:10] <+xeros720> (they should pay pat)
[1:15:11] <JDebss> Pat is doing a fabulous job
[1:15:11] <+gustavozxd> 100%
[1:15:11] <cerellium> good on ya tho
[1:15:12] <trueGarnish> honorable
[1:15:12] <mortalmanbaby> guess what you DONT HAVE TO SPEND MONEYT
[1:15:12] <DKDiamantes> You gotta know this stuff first
[1:15:14] <%DEETRz> now mention how many copies of venti you need if you wanna fully max him
[1:15:14] <dirtyswampman> you can play it just dont give um your credit card
[1:15:15] <otakon17> You'd need at least 100 rolls
[1:15:16] <+TopTierHarley> it's gambling, always have been
[1:15:17] <iosephe> Good Pat
[1:15:17] <steff_mcbee> yeah good for you tbh, I really really appreciate it
[1:15:17] <RoboticRexkek> that is fair
[1:15:18] <Louie_Salmon> @elkasle No it's literally a guarantee the second time, not a second 50% chance
[1:15:18] <SilverSnowFFXIV> He's explaining it so bad I'd have to play for myself.
[1:15:18] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt no that's even NOT guaranteed because it's still a COIN FLIP. You can still get two Heads if you want Tails
[1:15:19] <Alzero83> Get in the Robot, Pat! 13 Sentienls!
[1:15:20] <+jiggy_snipe> he needs to explain the positives and negatives
[1:15:20] <%SvenHolgersson> Pat is just talking about how fucked the gambling hole is
[1:15:21] <scrublord009> The game is good but there is gatcha. I like the game I just don't pay
[1:15:22] <+Ancopro> its pretty easy to not spend money when it's this gross
[1:15:22] <+TopTierHarley> just do f2p
[1:15:22] <CrazyMedicine> But are you going to get Venti?
[1:15:22] <+mMayrro> what do you mean this gacha game has shit monetization Kappa
[1:15:23] <%BubbaRands> THATS FAIR
[1:15:23] <RayCSmooth> fuck morals
[1:15:23] <cerellium> good guy pat
[1:15:24] <DemonioB> upload the gambling part alone on YouTube
[1:15:24] <mortalmanbaby> ok so dont spend money
[1:15:25] <%BaddonsBadAt> I mean the game is fun, and the best characters aren't required. But it is scummy as hell
[1:15:25] <+gustavozxd> hero pat
[1:15:25] <elspiceweasel> pat and morality go together like lamb and tunfish
[1:15:25] <Mrrashie> good guy pat!
[1:15:27] <trueGarnish> i already play POE :(
[1:15:27] <+TopTierHarley> It's not confusing at all :)
[1:15:28] <KoryMccool> the good part is that these charecters are the only locked thing as far as i know
[1:15:28] <fuji_92> yeah, ppl gotta now this
[1:15:28] <%AmericanaRed> lol WEAK PEOPLE GAMBLE shibuy4Kirby2
[1:15:30] <DevinMayCry> @otakon17 To garuntee the character drop because in 90 drops you wll get a 5 star. In 180 drops youa re garunteed the 5 star character if you didnt get her in first 90'
[1:15:30] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Big ups to Pat for that actually.
[1:15:30] <Tuna_Can_0> distStudy gamble... all ... the money
[1:15:32] <stormhawk9891> That's why you just go F2P on these games
[1:15:32] <DatAsuna> I'm not saying don't play, I'm saying don't buy
[1:15:32] <Jontman42> it's designed to exploit addiction, that's it
[1:15:34] <jorniev> GAMBLING ADDICTION IS A THING
[1:15:34] <+HelloImTom08> dont spent money of this game but you should play it IMO
[1:15:34] <+SilverDevilfish> 180 is average not guaranteed, if they allow doubles he's NEVER guaranteed
[1:15:35] <exack> @ELkasle It is a guarantee. If the first one isn't the rate up character, the second one is guaranteed to be it
[1:15:36] <nintega010> Pretty much just get the monthly if you want to really buy something.
[1:15:38] <LorcaNomad> if you spend money on gacha you're a ruined person
[1:15:38] <%cvp5127> thanks pat
[1:15:39] <wibbwobbler> death by waifu
[1:15:39] <%SvenHolgersson> The game can be perfectly fine if you ignore the gambling but it is INGRAINED into the game
[1:15:39] <quietshun> It's not that confusing though
[1:15:40] <+Akizea> theres no obfuscation lol
[1:15:40] <disflipmat> It's a half a percent chance to get a 5* during a roll, and THEN it's a 50% chance you get the unit you're after
[1:15:41] <nivlac_555> what?
[1:15:41] <+BigBruthaThunda> Pat gets head Pat...good Pat
[1:15:42] <%legendfather_of_giants> @VritraReiRei after 180, they do guarantee Venti tho
[1:15:42] <teflonbilly777> I've played it for free for only three days and am enjoying it, but worried about the gacha wall in the future
[1:15:44] <cerellium> the hero we need
[1:15:46] <satans_finest_millennial> if you cant win money from the roll its not gambling, its mind goblin burglary
[1:15:47] <rei0> yep
[1:15:47] <+Jaysky> Uh huh uh huh
[1:15:48] <andimustmask> this game can be played without spending a cent, or even LOOKING at the shop or banners, and is a good mechanically solid game on it's own
[1:15:48] <%TheDullaMAN> Hey, how about you just don't spend money on this.
[1:15:49] <+rissaleigh14> Good guy Pat
[1:15:50] <%YakumoYomi> I'mma be real: I might be willing to drop that kinda cash if said femboy was Ruka Urushibara
[1:15:51] <warmnoid> veiSlain
[1:15:52] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Then you take the balls to the store next door....
[1:15:54] <nivlac_555> that's stupid
[1:15:54] <+Harro8> Sounds like gacha
[1:15:54] <+Taglog7> Just play avengers Kappa
[1:15:55] <+mMayrro> don't waste money on gachas, subscribe to @PatStaresAt instead!

[1:15:57] <1matheuw> high level MLM bullshit
[1:15:58] <fuji_92> yeah, it really sint confusing but sure
[1:15:58] <+HelloImTom08> thats every gacha game ever
[1:15:58] <otakon17> I HATE THAT SHIT
[1:15:59] <cerellium> i mortgaged my house for venti
[1:16:00] <Zoh87> iunno I got 7 characters without spending so far and the game isnt hard enough to meta, like difficulty is updates away

[1:16:03] <otakon17> JUST LET ME BUY THE FUCKING THING
[1:16:03] <mortalmanbaby> your chouice to spend money so dont do it if you dont want to

[1:16:14] <+JohnXuandou> Xiao
[1:16:15] <LoneFonte> @PatStaresAt theres even the stardust thing

[1:16:16] <+rando_0268> I've spent like 10 bucks level 23 adventure rank. I have quite a bit of characters. no 5 star yet sadly
[1:16:16] <Solidnick18> play the game i guess

[1:16:20] <%BubbaRands> Grind
[1:16:20] <lloydbannings> that's what I'm doing

[1:16:22] <+TopTierHarley> run dailies do a monthly sub and just chill
[1:16:22] <Animorphimagi> so how did Pat get convinced to play FATE?
[1:16:23] <%DEETRz> this is the right way
[1:16:23] <ShinMaddrox> Venti is a dude
[1:16:23] <DevinMayCry> The 5 dollar monthly thing isnt bad though chat. Thats 20 pulls a month with it and then whatever you gather from drawing and questing
[1:16:24] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt you're doing your civil duty by educating people about a scam
[1:16:24] <+gustavozxd> oh man I want nero so much
[1:16:25] <gryffinp> ...which one was nero?
[1:16:25] <ape_hawk> anime nero is just nero, though
[1:16:26] <RayCSmooth> it's called don't waste money
[1:16:27] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Solution? Just play Granblue
[1:16:28] <%AmericanaRed> like normal people
[1:16:30] <+TheNewZealandStory> what is the difference between the limited wishing currency and the other wishing currency
[1:16:30] <Hanyusha> I saved for Tia in bleach and I have like 3
[1:16:31] <+Rofiarf> horde the free premium currency like a dragon.
[1:16:31] <ikantreeed> Venti is really good
[1:16:33] <katocrimson> blue ball and then coom
[1:16:34] <%BubbaRands> the f2p method
[1:16:34] <+JohnXuandou> I'm not saving up for anime Nero fuck that I'm saving up for Twink Dante
[1:16:36] <+BigBruthaThunda> Remember that time Pat gambled for a full stream in HOTS, and used all his streat donations for more pulls?
[1:16:36] <+gustavozxd> JEEEEEAAAAAAN
[1:16:36] <reonome> FISCHL IS TOP TIER THO

[1:16:37] <+AMagicalFlute> I care about Fischl and Jean
[1:16:37] <%AmericanaRed> JEAN shibuy4Kirby2
[1:16:38] <Solidnick18> gimme diluccccc
[1:16:39] <@ShockzNDrawe> Venti has one of the best exploration abilities in the game
[1:16:39] <fuji_92> who is anime nero
[1:16:39] <%AzureGale> Luckily there's only like 23 characters at the moment
[1:16:40] <+TopTierHarley> Barb is a better healer than Jean
[1:16:40] <$BoxNavy> you get xiangling at AR20
[1:16:41] <%Tornix> plus barb and xiang are essentially free
[1:16:41] <+Taglog7> PogChamp JEAN!
[1:16:41] <+AMagicalFlute> I have Diluc but not Jean
[1:16:43] <CHVMPLOO> jean is the best
[1:16:44] <happyfacespam> Jean and Diluc rooSuffer
[1:16:44] <iosephe> Oh hey it's saber
[1:16:44] <+mikesapartment> standards rotate too
[1:16:44] <+mMayrro> Diluc Kreygasm
[1:16:45] <takokasa> Have fun spending literally hundreds of dollars to get Jean
[1:16:46] <Hanyusha> Jean and Diluc?
[1:16:47] <klx5> this banner is misleading those two aren't rate up'd
[1:16:47] <+HelloImTom08> Diluc is dante and is hugly broken
[1:16:48] <$Afterman_> diluc is god
[1:16:49] <klx5> no you won't
[1:16:49] <+mrpengwinn> No
[1:16:50] <+TopTierHarley> NEVER PULL FROM THIS BANNER
[1:16:50] <+Jaysky> I'd like the spear guy with the mask
[1:16:50] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> oh no its just a fucking saber
[1:16:51] <@ShockzNDrawe> You can just shoot yourself into the sky whenever you want
[1:16:51] <%arancet> theyre nto boosted
[1:16:52] <%AlphaTauri> Lisa
[1:16:52] <+xeros720> haha, no you won't
[1:16:53] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt usually why Gacha works so much is because they give you enough to get a decent roster but then when you REALLY want someone they prey on the ADDICTS to fuel their revenue
[1:16:53] <%cvp5127> saber
[1:16:54] <andimustmask> @steff_mcbee it's not like they can suddenly paygate the overworld and combat mechanics without a huge tirefire
[1:16:54] <TheViltsuZ> BLATANT
[1:16:54] <%Regigangster> DONT FORGET TO MENTION CONSTELLATIONS
[1:16:54] <fuji_92> JEAN <3
[1:16:54] <TheNumberJay42> yay more saber clones
[1:16:55] <%AmericanaRed> LETS GOOO shibuy4Kirby2 shibuy4Kirby2 shibuy4Kirby2
[1:16:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt as a gacha vet, NEVER roll standard, always wait for rate-up
[1:16:55] <exack> THey aren't on rate up though
[1:16:55] <mak0t0yukii> No
[1:16:55] <TheViltsuZ> COPY
[1:16:57] <$BoxNavy> i want jean so bad dude
[1:16:57] <+ApocalypticExpress> they also go away pat
[1:16:57] <TheViltsuZ> OF FATE
[1:16:58] <lucky_icarus> FGO is absolutely this bad if not worst, in terms of rates that is. At least here, you can actually GET the unit you want.
[1:16:58] <Wauxx00> Diluc is broken
[1:16:58] <scrublord009> Diliuc is Fire Batman
[1:16:59] <Arth__> @PatStaresAt i got a account with both of them. To bad it's EU otherwise you could have it.
[1:16:59] <TheViltsuZ> SABER
[1:16:59] <fehraf> OR
[1:17:00] <Solidnick18> that's what i've been doing
[1:17:01] <otakon17> the broody boy
[1:17:01] <Zebroneath> Should mention, I got Jean from the limited roll.
[1:17:01] <+pmtriox> never standard
[1:17:02] <ElectricEmissary> we giving pat money yet to pull?
[1:17:03] <+killer_squid1990> They aren't guaranteed
[1:17:03] <%blitzrush1200> or a 5* item
[1:17:03] <+mrpengwinn> Jean and Diluc are not boosted at all @PatStaresAt
[1:17:03] <+MelodyMedley> That's a bad idea
[1:17:05] <+LynbellDaYo> This banner uses a different currency so it's fine to spend on it
[1:17:05] <neVan0> diluc <3
[1:17:05] <+gustavozxd> yeah never do it
[1:17:05] <1matheuw> thats what 540?
[1:17:06] <ItsMarchii> Pat never roll thiis
[1:17:07] <mak0t0yukii> 3 other 5 stars
[1:17:07] <+xeros720> yeah, check the rates on this one
[1:17:07] <DevinMayCry> Not true. Pull from banner with standard currency
[1:17:08] <Jontman42> now does only Diluc have a dick or does Jean have one too
[1:17:08] <RayCSmooth> no you won't
[1:17:08] <+killer_squid1990> They don't go away
[1:17:09] <ikantreeed> they don't
[1:17:09] <+EmiinV> only pull from that banner if you get the fates for it
[1:17:09] <RaidenRising> oh a saber
[1:17:09] <FlamingNarwhal> this banner also gives 5star weapons
[1:17:10] <+IntrepidEye> I've seen people blow $800 and still haven't gotten Diluc
[1:17:11] <+JohnXuandou> no this is the permanent roll
[1:17:11] <klx5> if you read details you'll see they are not boosted
[1:17:12] <+TopTierHarley> that's just a shiny picture
[1:17:14] <+ALazo> Pull from that banner if you don't care who you get
[1:17:14] <+LynbellDaYo> it doesn't go away
[1:17:15] <+xeros720> different banner, different rates
[1:17:15] <reonome> chat dumb
[1:17:16] <%DEETRz> its permanent
[1:17:17] <exack> @PatStaresAt They aren't on rate up so you aren't guaranteed to get them
[1:17:18] <+TopTierHarley> Don't pull from this banner
[1:17:18] <gryffinp> Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that odds of getting jean and diluc are still better on the venti one because there's no weapons at 5*?
[1:17:18] <wibbwobbler> QTs
[1:17:19] <%kewlmyc> No, just wait for them to show up in a rate up banner
[1:17:21] <%heartlesshealer> Standard ones have no time limit
[1:17:21] <DevinMayCry> The tokens to pull on this banner arent the same as the other banners
[1:17:21] <+BallerSwagBro9k> NEVER PULL STORY BANNER
[1:17:22] <+CarteretGC> This banner is forever and it sucks. too many weapons clogging it up
[1:17:23] <+pmtriox> they will change standard eventually
[1:17:24] <katocrimson> and uses different currency
[1:17:27] <maskedmook> they will probably get there own limited time banners later on
[1:17:29] <%DedlokPM> No. This is the Standard Banner. This will never go away.
[1:17:31] <shcifo> @PatStaresAt Technically you can get those two in ventis banner so you roll in that one anyway
[1:17:31] <BlkFlameKami> this is so fucking dumb
[1:17:31] <+Link232> You're better off pulling on the limited banner, since you still have a chance of pulling other 5 stars, AND there aren't 5* weapons clogging up the pull
[1:17:32] <steff_mcbee> @andimustmask but maybe the tirefire will be financially worth it to them, to retain whales and drive off unpaying players
[1:17:32] <+Rofiarf> yeah, but wait for them to be in a rate up banner.
[1:17:32] <fuji_92> pull after u got the venti only
[1:17:34] <1matheuw> saber face everywhere is working it seems
[1:17:36] <phoenix7240> this is the general pool banner
[1:17:37] <+BallerSwagBro9k> RATE UP CHANGES
[1:17:38] <alphonseisbest> @lucky_icarus no man, fgo does making it confusing to get SQ
[1:17:39] <+TopTierHarley> roll on Venti you can still get the cast
[1:17:43] <+Kuckles22> You are garenteed to get any 5 star including weapons
[1:17:43] <%caramelatte1> Thats a standard banner its less than 0.05%
[1:17:43] <+CaptainJax> I got Diluc from the Venti banner
[1:17:43] <%ConnorMezza> ConnorMezza subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:17:44] <+alpacaypse> they are also in venti's banner
[1:17:45] <Djinnazz> and UNINSTALL.
[1:17:47] <ikantreeed> I had diluc on the beginner banner
[1:17:47] <LorcaNomad> are you motherfuckers saying the characters on the standard banner rotate out?
[1:17:47] <Hanyusha> Venti is garbage anyway
[1:17:47] <DevinMayCry> Pats got 10 right there. Begging to pull
[1:17:48] <elspiceweasel> is paige eating a bowl of mustard?
[1:17:49] <+killer_squid1990> You actually have a better chance on the venti banner to get them
[1:17:50] <+ZoltanBMagnus> NOT FOR GACHA IT ISN'T CRAZY
[1:17:51] <MyNameIsRasus> Also you can also get a weapon instead of a character in this one
[1:17:52] <+ReiDuran> rate up is a lie.
[1:17:52] <+Ancopro> one is event wishes basicaaly
[1:17:53] <0rond> @PatStaresAt in most gachas, as characters get added, this banner will include some new ones and the chance to get jean and diluc will become even lower
[1:17:55] <+pectusumbra> Yeah, 2 gotcha is enough thanks
[1:17:56] <alphonseisbest> @PatStaresAt the banner is forever not the characters on it
[1:17:59] <+SilverDevilfish> Skyward Blade in a Zelda clone LuL
[1:18:00] <+D00msDayDan> oh no english va
[1:18:00] <DKDiamantes> Shes so cute
[1:18:00] <+HelloImTom08> she so cute
[1:18:01] <+ReiDuran> as a fgo player RATE UP IS A LIE.
[1:18:01] <scrublord009> THAT DUNGEON SUCKED
[1:18:02] <+BallerSwagBro9k> BUT U CAN PULL THEN ON THE LIMITED BANNER THO
[1:18:02] <%Tornix> so is barbara
[1:18:04] <%blitzrush1200> good luck getting her
[1:18:05] <Drigoooooo> That banner gets harder to pull when they add more chapters to that pool so it’s hard to get what you want
[1:18:05] <Hanyusha> WHY DID YOU ROLL FOR HER THEN?
[1:18:07] <+TopTierHarley> Only pull on Venti banner until it's gone
[1:18:08] <+HelloImTom08> didnt let her say the line
[1:18:08] <RaidenRising> 200 $ for a saber
[1:18:10] <teflonbilly777> Several characters are free as the story goes on
[1:18:11] <nailwind> very cute
[1:18:11] <%rdark_ksu> hell yea chef girl
[1:18:12] <otakon17> WHERE IS THE GUTS EXPY DAMMIT!?
[1:18:12] <ergulor> I'm happy with sdorica thank you
[1:18:14] <andimustmask> @steff_mcbee that's calling it shit for what COULD be in some dark future, not what is literally in front of you right now.
[1:18:14] <+Jaysky> Hewwo nice 2 meet u cirOwO
[1:18:15] <TheNumberJay42> also you need to roll the same character multiple times to level up their constellation crap
[1:18:16] <+BallerSwagBro9k> SHES HARD TO GET THO
[1:18:17] <ZippyPsycho> OH NO
[1:18:17] <CrowbarFacelift> Unlucky Ted
[1:18:19] <+Taglog7> HOW DID YOU KNOW?!!
[1:18:20] <%blitzrush1200> Barbra is free tho
[1:18:21] <%DedlokPM> @pmtriox they will add to it and change who is on the front, but, like their other game Honkai impact, the stuff stays in it and does not get taken out.
[1:18:22] <%heartlesshealer> oh god the primogems
[1:18:23] <+SilverDevilfish> so you're me
[1:18:24] <%BubbaRands> ME
[1:18:26] <Solidnick18> i got a few lucky pulls
[1:18:27] <+xeros720> yeah, he rolled the beginner banner
[1:18:27] <$BoxNavy> like me
[1:18:27] <DevinMayCry> You can roll without paying money too chat lol
[1:18:28] <trueGarnish> unlucky andy
[1:18:32] <AllenDeadman> wait... pat os actually playing this?
[1:18:32] <fuji_92> HOW UNLUCKY
[1:18:32] <otakon17> I need to replenish my manliness with all these waifu and cute dudes
[1:18:33] <%AmericanaRed> I'm not 4Head
[1:18:34] <jorniev> WAIFUNOMICS!
[1:18:34] <warmnoid> GFL spoiled me with how generous rolling is in that game
[1:18:35] <%Nordguy> wouldn't it be fucked up if they made it so your bought currency had a time limit?
[1:18:38] <CrowbarFacelift> ooh I love pity shit dust
[1:18:40] <+Link232> "Pity shit dust" is a good term for it, I gotta admit
[1:18:42] <+LynbellDaYo> PITY BITCHBOY DUST
[1:18:43] <+gustavozxd> oh yeah the shit dust
[1:18:44] <+Taglog7> CUCK DUST
[1:18:44] <otakon17> Pity Shit Dust XD
[1:18:44] <andimustmask> @steff_mcbee currently, you can play a mechanically solid game for completely free
[1:18:45] <teflonbilly777> IF YOU'RE UNLUCKY IT'S CAUSE THE UNIVERSE HATE YOU
[1:18:47] <%Tornix> that's a better name for the dust
[1:18:52] <+xir0gravity> other banner is guaranteed to be a 5* character if you roll a 5*
[1:18:53] <%BubbaRands> That’s what I call it
[1:18:54] <+chrishnaw> Can I eat the pity shit-dust?
[1:18:54] <ShinMaddrox> The game gives you 6 characters 7 if you count the First time roll banner
[1:18:55] <ape_hawk> wheres the angel dust??
[1:18:57] <%SirGO0SE> pitter
[1:18:58] <gslayer14> mmm
[1:19:00] <gslayer14> shitglitter
[1:19:01] <+shabop> you gotta clear some dungeon floor for xianling
[1:19:02] <CrowbarFacelift> pity shitty glitty
[1:19:06] <teflonbilly777> Buy Razor, he has a Wolf Stand
[1:19:06] <Solidnick18> WHAT
[1:19:07] <kesler031> SLIME SECRETIONS
[1:19:07] <+rissaleigh14> Fair name
[1:19:12] <%AmericanaRed> Can't blame me for your unluckiness shibuy4Kirby2
[1:19:14] <gryffinp> Yeah but shit characters.
[1:19:15] <+Taglog7> Cuck Glitter = Clitter
[1:19:15] <+xeros720> the glitter you only get from rolling 4*s
[1:19:16] <%AzureGale> 4* only tho
[1:19:18] <%scrumbotime> shitglitter is from 4 stars and up, shitdust is from 3 stars
[1:19:19] <%heartlesshealer> stardust for rolls has a Monthly Limit
[1:19:21] <+xeros720> so it's hard to get glitter
[1:19:23] <ShinMaddrox> Razor is pretty good
[1:19:23] <TheNumberJay42> pity shit glitter lmao
[1:19:24] <nintega010> Yeah me to
[1:19:25] <+EySoyCoco> yup. did the same fuckup myself
[1:19:27] <andimustmask> @steff_mcbee you can obtain literally every element/character type for free, so overworld puzzles and mechanical compositions for parties arent berred from you
[1:19:28] <+TopTierHarley> Razor is an A tier character
[1:19:29] <mortalmanbaby> @gryffinp Razor op
[1:19:31] <klx5> I don't think anyone not spending money will get enough starglitter for razor
[1:19:31] <%Kincast_Witchy> Pat get Razor he has a jojo stand
[1:19:31] <+Rofiarf> what happens with duplicate characters?
[1:19:33] <otakon17> God this is great
[1:19:33] <%Maids4lyfe> psaDab
[1:19:34] <DevinMayCry> GLitter is given for pulling
[1:19:42] <otakon17> I EXPECT YOU TO TWEET ABOUT THIS LATER PAT
[1:19:42] <+EmiinV> eh not really complicated
[1:19:44] <Lucasleonava> Razor is a Stand user
[1:19:46] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Playing this right now I just got an achievement called "Gold Experience Requiem"
[1:19:48] <+MeatBomb> OSFrog
[1:19:49] <scarman125> @patstaresat i spent my glitter on Razor and he's amazing.
[1:19:52] <%BigCoffee> Ok but the real important thing now Pat, is how much of the game can you do when you're a F2P dweeb
[1:19:53] <@ShockzNDrawe> The Venti banner also doesn't have any 5* weapons so if you geta 5* it's guaranteed to be a character
[1:19:54] <quietshun> Not really honestly
[1:19:56] <otakon17> The monthly pass
[1:19:57] <+HelloImTom08> yea i got the 5$ thing
[1:20:00] <Solidnick18> it's not that much
[1:20:07] <%caramelatte1> While also upgrading your character further
[1:20:07] <+london_flexing> If you stack the currencies they make a pyramid ;)
[1:20:09] <+TopTierHarley> You can do the full game @BigCoffee
[1:20:09] <andimustmask> @steff_mcbee (that being you can get a fire/earth/water/ice/lightning character from just doing story and sidequests, requiring no rolls or shop interaction)
[1:20:11] <Louie_Salmon> I feel bad spending money on these games, I feel like a sucker
[1:20:12] <0rond> is razor a free character or do you only get them from the glitter?
[1:20:12] <suikudo> like to stack time?
[1:20:14] <VoxelFox51> @BigCoffee Good Question
[1:20:14] <%AzureGale> @Rofiarf Pity dust and mats to upgrade the one you have
[1:20:15] <$BoxNavy> i might get the 6.99 thing
[1:20:17] <Shion963> how much is the battle pass? I'm just at 18
[1:20:21] <+LynbellDaYo> you can play the entirety of the game free, you just won't get your waifus and husbandos
[1:20:23] <+gustavozxd> that's what I do every time
[1:20:24] <+Link232> Best value in this game is monthly -> battle pass -> maybe first-time purchase on like the 30 buck one, then the rest is just whalin'
[1:20:25] <$Dakuu75> 9 months
[1:20:26] <gryffinp> @Louie_Salmon Good! You should! f2p for lyfe
[1:20:26] <generalve> @patstaresat okay how legitimately good is this game ?
[1:20:27] <$Dakuu75> lol
[1:20:28] <+TopTierHarley> @0rond have to roll for Razor
[1:20:28] <Go4theKnees> but is the game good lol
[1:20:29] <nailwind> @BigCoffee all of it
[1:20:30] <DevinMayCry> @BoxNavy Its just 5 dollars in America
[1:20:30] <KaiserMario> It's like giving birth, or something...
[1:20:32] <+Syfin_> whats the replayability of this game? isnt it just single player?
[1:20:32] <+xeros720> 10 bucks for the battle pass
[1:20:33] <+OwlLightningMage> Just don't play the game
[1:20:34] <$BoxNavy> no
[1:20:34] <FlamingNarwhal> @0rond Razor isnt free
[1:20:35] <+xeros720> usd that is
[1:20:35] <Thirtine> @BigCoffee pretty much all of it, you get characters through the story and other events
[1:20:35] <Louie_Salmon> @shion963 $20 and it isn't even good
[1:20:36] <%BubbaRands> Blow my 9 month load
[1:20:36] <MasterTonberry23> @Louie_Salmon well, live and learn (hanging on the edge of tomorrow)
[1:20:38] <ikantreeed> this is EXACTLY what I'm doing
[1:20:40] <+MeatBomb> Is the game even fun?
[1:20:40] <steff_mcbee> @andimustmask you're totally right! But I don't want to get into the game until the launch-dust settles and we see what it'll be for years to come is all, I don't wanna get attached to it and then have stuff start getting gated later, or run into a wall where I can't keep up with the lategame stats
[1:20:42] <%DedlokPM> @Rofiarf 1st 6 dupes get you an item to buff various stuff for the character and some glitter. After 1st 6 dupes you get more glitter than you did before
[1:20:42] <wibbwobbler> in it 4 the long haul lol
[1:20:43] <+D00msDayDan> @Shion963 $10, or $20 if you want to jump to rank 10 right away
[1:20:44] <Klefth> Or just never support anything with gacha and give SCUMBAG publishers with SCUMBAG systems the idea that it's ok at all.
[1:20:44] <+HelloImTom08> The whales are out there
[1:20:45] <reonome> thank you whales for paying for us f2p peasants
[1:20:45] <+Axle13j> That's that F2P strat
[1:20:46] <Zoh87> battlepass is like 10$ @shion963
[1:20:48] <+RowenCleric> but I want my waifu with a big butt....
[1:20:49] <mr_slaide> Waifus and traps!
[1:20:49] <neptious> How fun is this to play without spending a dime past just the initial purchase?
[1:20:49] <$BoxNavy> @DevinMayCry i am canadian too lol
[1:20:49] <+TopTierHarley> yes, the game is fun
[1:20:49] <flatty1000> this seems more like a coupon catalogue than a game
[1:20:49] <irziggo> but you need 7 Venti
[1:20:50] <%JohnAtDawn> Lol no power creep
[1:20:51] <TheNumberJay42> reminder you need to roll characters multiple time to level up their constellation shit
[1:20:51] <+gustavozxd> WELL THEN
[1:20:51] <%AmericanaRed> The game ain't like that LUL
[1:20:52] <%blitzrush1200> New characters!!
[1:20:52] <%Nordguy> Fuck this, I got Hades!
[1:20:52] <+mMayrro> now get more to upgrade him 4Head
[1:20:52] <+HelloImTom08> @MeatBomb yea
[1:20:53] <%caramelatte1> Now get SIX MORE
[1:20:53] <%BubbaRands> Nope
[1:20:54] <%heartlesshealer> Gambling =)

[1:21:41] <Hanyusha> it's my fav one
[1:21:41] <MasterTonberry23> Why are you people getting mad at Pat?
[1:21:41] <otakon17> Venti is the ONLY FIVE STAR CHARACTER IN THAT BANNER
[1:21:42] <pixelkenj> chat cant deal with this
[1:21:42] <%cvp5127> level up your np LUL

[1:21:46] <+OwlLightningMage> I am never playing this shit ever LUL
[1:21:46] <DevinMayCry> This is unrelated to level cap chat
[1:21:47] <%Tornix> yuuup honkai impact has something similar too
[1:21:49] <RaidenRising> Dude what the fuck
[1:21:50] <%MonsterEnvy> PAt you can just play the game and get this stuff

[1:21:55] <otakon17> ...3 grand
[1:21:55] <+Rofiarf> guarantees usually don't stay after the first time it triggers, not sure about genshin.
[1:21:55] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> yeaaaaaaah...I'mma let you handle this game, Pat. NotLikeThis
[1:21:56] <DevinMayCry> Raising level cap raises other stats and passives
[1:21:57] <DatAsuna> But also eminently ignorable
[1:21:57] <%paladinstarbuster> damn that's bs
[1:21:57] <$BoxNavy> what a value
[1:21:57] <rei0> more than that
[1:21:58] <1matheuw> fuck right offfff
[1:21:58] <OldOnyx> well fuck this game then
[1:21:58] <TheNumberJay42> gacha gaming :)
[1:21:59] <%SvenHolgersson> THATS ONE PRICY TWINK
[1:21:59] <s1rcuit> Pat is keeping people off the streets
[1:21:59] <%templar010> fuuUUUck that
[1:22:00] <$zyberion626> (to be very fair, those upgrades are NOT critical)
[1:22:00] <trueGarnish> ez money
[1:22:00] <+TinyLittleDancer> 90% of developing this game was board meetings on monetization systems
[1:22:01] <%Bailey__gaming> 3100
[1:22:01] <otakon17> these people are MONSTERS
[1:22:01] <+pmtriox> but ANIME TATAs
[1:22:02] <1matheuw> wtf is that
[1:22:03] <%rdark_ksu> damn thats like 3 months rent
[1:22:03] <ScreamLord> FUCK THAT
[1:22:03] <+AMagicalFlute> I got stoned at the beginning of this explanation
[1:22:03] <Klefth> So, in otherwords, FUCK THIS GAME
[1:22:03] <+gustavozxd> @Tornix most gatcha do
[1:22:03] <exack> GAMBLING Pog
[1:22:03] <%toastybites> @Animorphimagi warframe has like 5 slot machines
[1:22:04] <EuropanLamprey> This game is Evil
[1:22:04] <andimustmask> @steff_mcbee that's basically saying you have no interest in playing at all, since waiting to see years of content will basically be by the time the game is on it's way out in all likelihood
[1:22:04] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Abilities are optional
[1:22:04] <fuji_92> but for real, just play for free chat
[1:22:04] <teflonbilly777> $3100 anime boipussy
[1:22:05] <+Harro8> Can probably farm this in the future
[1:22:05] <neptious> Is this fun to play or just a very pretty game?
[1:22:05] <KoryMccool> oh baby thats spicy
[1:22:06] <+Ancopro> BUT
[1:22:07] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt remember that's not guaranteed. If you need a Tails you can still get two Heads!
[1:22:08] <otakon17> BUT THE GAME IS SO FUCKING PRETTY
[1:22:08] <Drarrk> There is another way to get the constellation stuff. You can grind tokens from chests to get the element shards for them. Each region lets you get one for their specific element.
[1:22:08] <LoneFonte> WHO THE FUCK IS GOING TO PULL 7 VENTIS
[1:22:08] <A_Cat_Herder> fuck this monetization
[1:22:12] <%za7az> WutFace
[1:22:14] <+elcapitanspider> oh shit its one of these gacha's trash
[1:22:14] <Hanyusha> too late
[1:22:14] <%cvp5127> too much math NotLikeThis
[1:22:14] <nailwind> which no one even needs to do
[1:22:14] <1matheuw> ALL THAT FOR ONE CHAR
[1:22:15] <+rando_0268> Lesson of the game. You dont need it
[1:22:15] <T_Sasquatch> Don't
[1:22:15] <+HelloImTom08> play the game just dont gamble LUL
[1:22:16] <DatAsuna> just don't max it, you're not gonna hit a gameplay wall
[1:22:16] <Ambiguous_Anti> @PatStaresAt please you're scaring the people who want to justify this
[1:22:16] <%DedlokPM> @otakon17 no he is not. I got Jean from that Venti banner and she is 5 star.
[1:22:17] <fuji_92> the game is fun when free
[1:22:18] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt You can just play the game no need to pay anything
[1:22:18] <%TheDullaMAN> Fuck Gacha
[1:22:19] <+xeros720> they don't have big enough tits for people to pay that much, not like FGO
[1:22:20] <DevinMayCry> 6 Ventis
[1:22:20] <flatty1000> yeah don't play this
[1:22:20] <$BoxNavy> ok
[1:22:21] <reonome> @neptious its legit fun, just don't gamble
[1:22:21] <DatAsuna> Just don't be a minmaxer
[1:22:21] <+pmtriox> get the free
[1:22:22] <mortalmanbaby> wow gachas who knew
[1:22:23] <%SirGO0SE> it called gacha cause they gacha
[1:22:23] <+HelloImTom08> just dont gamble 4Head
[1:22:24] <@SoFarFetched> PSA for everyone in chat on spending money on this: DON'T Kappa
[1:22:25] <Shion963> I hope they be like Dragalia and revamp that shit Real Quick
[1:22:25] <+OwlLightningMage> Thank you for the information Pat. You have convinced me to never play this game ever LUL
[1:22:25] <Thirtine> @otakon17 nope! talents, leveling stats and character level are all in game, constellation stuff isnt needed
[1:22:25] <%AzureGale> He's right, you know
[1:22:25] <Wauxx00> Exactly. Play the game. Dont play the gacha.
[1:22:28] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> SURPRISE. MECHANICS.
[1:22:28] <+EmiinV> venti isn't the only five star
[1:22:29] <Hanyusha> Those brown girls in Bleach are calling to me man
[1:22:30] <+Pyroclase> I'll get addicted to casino games if I want okay
[1:22:30] <+BallerSwagBro9k> PAT WERE NOT USING MONEY
[1:22:30] <BlkFlameKami> you can easily just buy BOTW instead
[1:22:31] <Jetsfantasy> That's if you DON'T play the game at all to max shit. Play the game and you get shit
[1:22:32] <DevinMayCry> The first one is already unlocked when you get it
[1:22:32] <fuji_92> just play it free
[1:22:33] <Zoh87> you dont need these passives unless they way up the diff
[1:22:33] <+Necayde> as of rank 31 i have 11000 primo and 16 fates sat waiting for a banner i want
[1:22:34] <tattleworm> i'm playing sinoalice and that has this stuff and competitive pvp. the top guilds have spent multiple thousands.
[1:22:34] <%Capn_Trips> Gatcha is completely unnessecary for this game
[1:22:34] <%cowardman93> the free is good
[1:22:34] <Louie_Salmon> @lonefonte Someone. The whales are what they count on
[1:22:35] <teflonbilly777> FOR NOW
[1:22:35] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Drarrk if you read the rules, the game straight up guarantees a venti every 180 rolls
[1:22:36] <+Spag313> sounds like it would be better to just find a better game
[1:22:38] <+TopTierHarley> I've also spent 0
[1:22:38] <%Nordguy> you could buy a MAIL ORDER HUSBAND for that
[1:22:38] <+Fynale> alot of ppl do that in a lot of gacha stuff
[1:22:39] <mortalmanbaby> YORU AMKING PEOPLE NOT WANT TO PLAY PAT STOP
[1:22:39] <+BallerSwagBro9k> WERE F2P
[1:22:40] <DatAsuna> @flatty1000 or just play and don't be a goblin
[1:22:41] <Jontman42> if you have a tendency for anything akin to gambling addiction DO NOT TOUCH THIS GAME
[1:22:42] <BanSenpai> im free to play ar 27, its hard finding good quests for exp tho
[1:22:43] <+TopTierHarley> I have shit I want

[1:22:47] <+TopTierHarley> you can play this f2p
[1:22:48] <VritraReiRei> @LoneFonte WHALES WHO HAVE HER AS THEIR WAIFU
[1:22:49] <DatAsuna> Gacha only gets crazy people
[1:22:51] <phantomsleeves> is it fun though
[1:22:52] <nailwind> gacha does NOT impact the good gameplay
[1:22:52] <+Pendragwn> That you need to play it like a job to save money :)
[1:22:53] <fuji_92> f2p only
[1:22:53] <%heartlesshealer> YOU COULD BY A PS4
[1:22:54] <%DedlokPM> @otakon17 Venti is the only 5 star in the banner with a drop rate boost
[1:22:55] <1matheuw> now do the math for all the characters
[1:22:56] <+HelloImTom08> Pat says no to drugs and gambling
[1:22:56] <%Bailey__gaming> f2p for life
[1:22:56] <gslayer14> GOOD
[1:22:56] <steff_mcbee> @andimustmask oh, sorry, what I meant was waiting until the launch buzz dies down, at which point they might change the numbers, so I'm thinking I'll have my answer in a few months
[1:22:56] <%logoth_> Good
[1:22:56] <@SoFarFetched> MORTALMANBABY LUL
[1:22:57] <+OwlLightningMage> Just don't play the game at all
[1:22:58] <Djinnazz> GOOD.
[1:22:58] <+JohnXuandou> no this is what this game needs as a primer, legitimately
[1:22:58] <%FlakkLIVE> This game especially can totally be F2P. It's ALL single-player
[1:23:00] <+Jaysky> Too fuckin bad
[1:23:00] <nivlac_555> GOOD
[1:23:00] <DevinMayCry> Not for everyone
[1:23:02] <$BoxNavy> but this is a part of the game
[1:23:02] <%SirGO0SE> GOOD
[1:23:03] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Maybe they shouldn't play then.
[1:23:05] <+Rofiarf> if you have an addictive personality, just avoid it.
[1:23:05] <klx5> the game is scaring people away from the game.
[1:23:05] <TheNumberJay42> never given a gacha game money feels good man

[1:24:41] <phantomsleeves> jesus christ
[1:24:42] <%legendfather_of_giants> @TheSaintJohn good
[1:24:45] <otakon17> @phantomsleeves yes he has played a bit, a boss was kicking his ass because he thought he could beat it at level 20 when it's LEVEL THIRTY SIX.
[1:24:48] <+G_Thunders> But I want the second-hand gambling tho...
[1:24:48] <+TinyLittleDancer> Exactly, these games depend on being portrayed as not really gacha games because they know the rightful stigma
[1:24:49] <$BoxNavy> but yeah this game is legit really cool and you can ignore the gacha
[1:24:49] <%Capn_Trips> Man the harpoons boys
[1:24:50] <teflonbilly777> >Not getting off to watching Pat open lootboxes
[1:24:51] <Slimeking_Mike> SCHUMBAG STREAM FUCK YOU
[1:24:51] <+D00msDayDan> kinda weird how the game doesn't save your payment information, but punching it in every time does give you a extra chance to say "what the fuck am i doing with my life" and back down
[1:24:52] <+Pendragwn> @scrublord009 but I NEED it
[1:24:53] <chancho4tierra> If pat can control his stand this time can CRAZY TALK his way in a Venti
[1:24:55] <0rond> dammit if only FGO had gotten to pat first
[1:24:56] <%BubbaRands> LOOTBOX 2.0
[1:25:03] <Vismal> is he doing it?
[1:25:04] <$Invlux> @sendart I see you bitch
[1:25:06] <teflonbilly777> This is my peepshow!
[1:25:06] <%Razputin217> Now all of China knows your credit card info Kappa
[1:25:07] <+NitronStreams> If your the kind of asshole that spends money on gacha then the least you could do is let us see your credit card info
[1:25:14] <+BigBruthaThunda> State legislators are going to end up using Pat's streams as evidence against this shit
[1:25:14] <%AmericanaRed> LETS GET THAT JOJO CHARACTER
[1:25:24] <andimustmask> @steff_mcbee that isnt to say that you can't wait and see, just that you can play without dumping money into it at all, so even if it gets moneygated in some future nefarious business timeline, you can have a clean break
[1:25:25] <%Bailey__gaming> I like the game buy hate the monitzation
[1:25:25] <Wauxx00> D00msDayDan tbh I think thats good in some cases LUL
[1:25:29] <Teyaric> @BigBruthaThunda GOOD
[1:25:30] <otakon17> GET THE CUTE LAD
[1:25:30] <T_Sasquatch> Pat go fuck yourself for that bullshit psa lie then instantly running it back
[1:25:30] <sendart> @Invlux lol
[1:25:32] <+TopTierHarley> Pat, please don't pull on the standard banner, it really is not worth it
[1:25:32] <+Pendragwn> @AmericanaRed THERE'S JOJOS IN THIS???? I'm in
[1:25:36] <tri3dgE027> This would make for an interesting Podcast topic next week LUL
[1:25:41] <+HelloImTom08> Razor FeelsAmazingMan
[1:25:42] <%legendfather_of_giants> @0rond I really think if pat didnt hate fate on principle he would have gotten into fgo
[1:25:45] <otakon17> don't worry
[1:25:49] <+Aeonleon> Razor has a Wolf stand
[1:25:52] <otakon17> Pat'll pull for the cute bard boy
[1:26:01] <Zoh87> the issue I have so far with this game I hit rank 30 and its still piss easy, as a f2p player
[1:26:04] <%ExpressNode> Finally beat blaster master zero 2. That game has some weird difficultly spikes
[1:26:07] <%Capn_Trips> @0rond Fate folks drove himm off that long ago
[1:26:08] <andimustmask> @steff_mcbee and you get a free breath of the wild with actually good combat mechanics in the meantime
[1:26:11] <KoryMccool> watch pat get like 8 vents
[1:26:16] <+gustavozxd> fate fans are possibly the only reason pat doesn't like fate
[1:26:21] <Mawarup> Do as I say, not as I do the Pat way
[1:26:22] <gryffinp> Pat has stated his intent to not pull for the bard boi in favor of pulling for the saberface
[1:26:26] <%AzureGale> The endgame is where the wall comes up
[1:26:28] <%DedlokPM> $10 says right now pat is getting declined and he has to call his bank to tell them to allow the transaction. psaWhat
[1:26:33] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Fate community turned Pat off Fate LUL
[1:26:33] <Teyaric> Even the homestucks arent that bad any more
[1:26:42] <TheViltsuZ> FUCK SABERFACE AND FUCK FATEFANS
[1:26:43] <+TopTierHarley> He has a better chance at getting Jean in the Venti banner
[1:26:44] <+Pendragwn> @andimustmask but do you put in 200 hours for a crumb of pussy to kill evil
[1:26:47] <+G_Thunders> @zoh87 I don’t know how this game works, but doesn’t most F2P stuff have a difficulty spike later on once it gets players hooked?
[1:26:56] <mortalmanbaby> @Teyaric homestuck still exists?
[1:26:57] <gryffinp> Jean is a saberface, you know I'm right
[1:26:58] <Shion963> I'm a lucksack who pulled Diluc on the first 10 I did
[1:26:58] <+NitronStreams> homestucks barely exist anymore
[1:26:58] <xxmagonx> What character is the Vergil of this game?
[1:26:59] <teflonbilly777> Fate is only good for doujins
[1:27:00] <quietshun> @theviltsuz no u
[1:27:02] <AllenDeadman> I'm actually glad pat addressed the whole gacha situation of this game
[1:27:02] <LunarRemix> Not all of them
[1:27:04] <Zoh87> is endgame at rank 60? because the quests more or less stop at 30
[1:27:11] <gryffinp> @xxmagonx DDiluc
[1:27:11] <MasterTonberry23> What the hell is homestuck?
[1:27:13] <CrazyMedicine> We need to roll Vergil
[1:27:22] <ShinMaddrox> You get to play as Diluc and Venti as Trial characters. Venti ain't anything interesting compared to other bow users.
[1:27:26] <+Aeonleon> I like my team atm, lightning resonance with Fischl and Razor. Qiqi for heals and super conduct, Xiangling for overload
[1:27:27] <%legendfather_of_giants> @G_Thunders that's how most time-based F2P games work (like idles), but gacha doesn't have as much of that
[1:27:27] <xxmagonx> Awsome
[1:27:27] <Go4theKnees> does the game every become less of a faceroll?
[1:27:28] <+TopTierHarley> you do dungeons until the content update
[1:27:28] <%Bailey__gaming> I pulled my free Noelle and 10 off each banner and that's me done, I didn't pay a penny
[1:27:29] <Zoh87> very much a 'live service' game
[1:27:29] <chancho4tierra> Got 2 Barbaras in 1 pull
[1:27:30] <TheZearGuy> Only 1 gacha has ever got me. Took me for 80 bucks and played it for about 2 years. Seems fair enough.
[1:27:32] <LunarRemix> @G_Thunders I don't know if it's the case with Genshin but with Arknights it's totally doable without using the 5 or 6*
[1:27:32] <Teyaric> @Teyaric It continues. It's now a meta analysis of how bad fan devotion can be. Yiffany, Jade's daugher, is a central character
[1:27:33] <+rissaleigh14> Pat knows it’s too late to save him but at least he tried to save chat
[1:27:35] <Demon_chann> @G_Thunders from what i played not really but i heard endgame coop is basically mandatory
[1:27:36] <happyfacespam> G_Thunders 3 of the 4 free characters are quite good, and you get free characters after progression, i never felt pressured to buy anything
[1:27:42] <0rond> pat:fuck fate (haha) fate fans: wow fuck you (haha) Pat: see this is why I can't get into fate
[1:27:45] <+TopTierHarley> @shinmaddrox Venti is one of the best characters in the game
[1:27:46] <%DedlokPM> @xxmagonx SPOILERS: Your twin is probably the Vergil of this game.
[1:27:47] <%darwood_> this game good?
[1:27:48] <AllenDeadman> @Zoh87 Eventually there will be updates that add whole new areas and add more stuff to do
[1:27:51] <TheViltsuZ> Why is the PS4 Pro version 30fps when even my shitty phone runs it at 60? Is this the power of Chinese optimization? Not like I would even play the PS4 version since it's censored but still.
[1:27:53] <+HelloImTom08> @Go4theKnees abyss dungoen at AR 20 is pretty tough
[1:27:56] <Shion963> venti can creat wind pillars on his own

[1:29:05] <DevinMayCry> You have 10 tokens for standard already looked like
[1:29:06] <mak0t0yukii> Venti
[1:29:06] <reonome> you can get diluc and jean on the venti banner anyway
[1:29:06] <teflonbilly777> NO
[1:29:07] <+zacyzacy> Yes the venti
[1:29:07] <+Billyfig1> get the starbucks banner
[1:29:07] <garrulousAuthority> 5 years and thousands of dollars into F/GO
[1:29:07] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt you have better rates for Jean/Diluc in Venti banner than standard
[1:29:07] <+LynbellDaYo> Venti, don't waste currency on Acquaint
[1:29:08] <xxmagonx> Standard
[1:29:08] <%Capn_Trips> Do not roll off rate up you fool
[1:29:08] <alphonseisbest> STANDARD
[1:29:08] <+D00msDayDan> piss everyone off with the gear banner lol
[1:29:08] <%cowardman93> standard, there's a character with judgement cut end
[1:29:08] <+rando_0268> Fishl is really good
[1:29:09] <chancho4tierra> yeah the venti
[1:29:09] <+EmiinV> venti banner
[1:29:09] <+killogram123> go for jean
[1:29:09] <Sotetsu> Venti is a better de
[1:29:09] <BlkFlameKami> EMLO
[1:29:10] <otakon17> Elmo is jelly of Gief getting the love
[1:29:10] <@SSaryn> Venti literally gives you Wind Currents
[1:29:11] <+TopTierHarley> only Venti
[1:29:11] <Firaga64> VENTI
[1:29:12] <theonefinger> yes
[1:29:12] <Shion963> I guess Venti
[1:29:13] <DatAsuna> do what you want
[1:29:13] <+Lexiellent> beginners wish first then venti
[1:29:14] <xxneko_gamixx> dont roll at all
[1:29:17] <andimustmask> getting a 5* weapon is soulcrushing
[1:29:18] <happyfacespam> Venti yeah, although the 5 star weapons are also good
[1:29:18] <%FlakkLIVE> Venti banner tbh. Much better stuff AND no 5* weapons
[1:29:19] <alphonseisbest> I WANNA SEE THAT CASH BURN
[1:29:19] <TheZearGuy> Jean!
[1:29:20] <+xeros720> yeah, probably more likely to get jean/diluc that way
[1:29:21] <KoryMccool> oh this is bad
[1:29:21] <Arth__> yea but the standard only gives thrash weapons 3/4
[1:29:21] <@ShockzNDrawe> that said you have a 50% chance of getting venti
[1:29:22] <+charp35> You always want to do the focuses banners they have better rates
[1:29:23] <%Roundelay11> Venti is incredibly good in exploration
[1:29:23] <teflonbilly777> Fishl is cool
[1:29:23] <%blitzrush1200> Huh
[1:29:26] <%Spyke889> @PatStaresAt roll venti get diluc like me
[1:29:27] <+killogram123> @PatStaresAt 5 star weapons are actually pretty great

[1:29:34] <ShinMaddrox> @TopTierHarley Fischl is better gameplay wise. Stats is probably is better for Venti but playing him is boring.
[1:29:35] <fuji_92> roll character banner until character, is the law

[1:40:57] <katocrimson> "free"
[1:40:57] <Jontman42> I paid 140 dollars to get this for free
[1:40:57] <%Gogogolem> Razor is super good
[1:40:58] <+ZoltanBMagnus> @PatStaresAt did you just spend $140 just to prove a point and spite gacha?
[1:41:00] <stabbityrabbit> Hey chat is Razor good? Thinking about saving for him.
[1:41:00] <andimustmask> "bonus"
[1:41:00] <+TopTierHarley> not that one
[1:41:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> What's the fun of gacha if you spend money? That's practically cheating :)
[1:41:01] <RemnanTaka> SO CLOSE
[1:41:01] <+Link232> I like how the gacha is the top action on the action wheel
[1:41:02] <+RhaskaFyraska> razor is awesome
[1:41:02] <+SunnyStrachan> yes
[1:41:04] <+LynbellDaYo> roll standard and get Jean first try
[1:41:07] <+NitronStreams> I bought a new monitor for less money than what Pat just spent on this
[1:41:07] <KoryMccool> this is like... actually depressing
[1:41:07] <+RowenCleric> wait that was 140 bucks for that quick!?
[1:41:09] <$BoxNavy> yep

[1:41:18] <MasterTonberry23> eh it was fun to watch i guess
[1:41:19] <pixelkenj> you won big on the gacha thoguh
[1:41:20] <+dredgyboi> Pat thank you, I saw people in my FC playing this and was curious, you just talked me out it.
[1:41:22] <%LailahQueenx> no you wanted to do it anyway and made it into a lesson
[1:41:22] <+gustavozxd> @ikantreeed if you roll 10 you get one gauranteed 4 star
[1:41:22] <otakon17> more shitty weapons!
[1:41:22] <RoboticRexkek> see kids, gamlbing isn't fun
[1:41:23] <+xeros720> something happened and it cost 140 dollars
[1:41:23] <yourliteraldog> Crack addict stream
[1:41:24] <hamborgini> did they getcha, son?
[1:41:24] <DKDiamantes> He spent it cause he really wanted Jean but didnt want to admit it
[1:41:24] <Explodincatz> no
[1:41:24] <%TIME_PUNCHER> but what was the point?
[1:41:24] <fuji_92> yes
[1:41:24] <+Link232> You'll only ever prove a point if you spent like 500 trying for Diluc
[1:41:25] <+b_aleph> You could have 2 next gen games for that money and you'd still have 20 dollars...no, wait...
[1:41:25] <+MrAtheGreat> Pat, you could have bought 14 homeless peoples with that money
[1:41:25] <TuxedoNash> sure did champ
[1:41:27] <%ChestMimik> That was HOW MUCH?
[1:41:28] <+CaptainJax> he spent $140 on something that's for sure
[1:41:28] <+OwlLightningMage> HE HAS A PROBLEM
[1:41:29] <+SunnyStrachan> but what did we learn?
[1:41:29] <Slimeking_Mike> This is soul annihilating
[1:41:29] <Shion963> you started out to but then got dopamine
[1:41:30] <%BubbaRands> YES but you’re right so it’s worth it
[1:41:30] <%Jaxnos> we must prove the point by having the best odds, yes quite
[1:41:30] <+killer_squid1990> Spear for Xiangling
[1:41:31] <RoboticRexkek> wink wink
[1:41:31] <+BallerSwagBro9k> and u failed XD
[1:41:31] <reonome> @ikantreeed no 4* gurantee though
[1:41:31] <gryffinp> @PatStaresAt You spent $140 to try to prove a point about gacha, and then failed, because you got the shiny anime boy.

[1:45:27] <teflonbilly777> Not Moblins
[1:45:28] <%dekkitout> Her 'E' puts heal over time which applies to whoever is active

[1:46:05] <Solidnick18> wtf
[1:46:06] <DKDiamantes> That blocks incoming projectiles
[1:46:06] <+Jaysky> Sucking, blowing, same thing for Venti
[1:46:06] <+EmiinV> that blocks projectiles
[1:46:06] <+MelodyMedley> Venti's all about the elemental stuff

[1:46:17] <andimustmask> @PatStaresAt read their effects in the Talents tab in thec ahracter menu
[1:46:17] <otakon17> so you got THREE ranged characters
[1:46:18] <MasterTonberry23> @TheViltsuZ no it has its own app, get it from their website
[1:46:18] <DKDiamantes> And it supes up her ult
[1:46:18] <soapwrecker> PICK THE CRYSTAL
[1:46:18] <katocrimson> reinhardt?
[1:46:19] <+eanscrale> Okay yeah she's pretty dope
[1:46:19] <gryffinp> It seems like they want the geo character to be all about terrain control and advantage but I think that's too deep for this game
[1:46:19] <+DoctaDiesel> shes honesty pretty good I dunno why people would say she sucks
[1:46:20] <Cyberwrisket> the gate does damage and blocks projectiles, also it adds projectiles to her ult
[1:46:20] <suikudo> Everyone has a 5* but me godamnit
[1:46:21] <disflipmat> Probably acts like the Titan's Ward of Dawn so you can shoot through it but enemies can't

[1:46:33] <+CarteretGC> its an absorb shield
[1:46:35] <Mrrashie> will this game have PvP?
[1:46:37] <+smevvster> The shield blocks enemy projectiles, and it has a synergy with her Y @PatStaresAt
[1:46:38] <%Regigangster> She only buffs WAY high level
[1:46:38] <%AzureGale> Amber is like the only actually bad character
[1:46:40] <TheViltsuZ> @MasterTonberry23 Ok thanks.
[1:46:40] <DevinMayCry> HE SURE IS
[1:46:41] <teflonbilly777> Fucked up gacha mechanics aside, this is a pretty fun game. I haven't spent a buck on it yet
[1:46:41] <Solidnick18> oh what

[1:48:08] <%heartlesshealer> bottom left

[1:48:36] <+Harro8> Checkout Xianglings ones
[1:48:37] <+Dova573> man all these mentions of Venti is giving me work ptsd
[1:48:38] <Shion963> damn
[1:48:39] <Go4theKnees> pay money, trivialize the game
[1:48:40] <TheViltsuZ> 12GB and the game is free? Fuck I'll download it.
[1:48:40] <OldOnyx> I feel hollow just witnessing this
[1:48:46] <Shion963> yo
[1:48:48] <siontxc> Can characters get more moves
[1:48:50] <DevinMayCry> Miphas Grace
[1:48:50] <$BoxNavy> ridickalus
[1:48:51] <%Gogogolem> just need 3 more barbaras
[1:48:51] <siontxc> Can characters get more moves ?

[1:48:57] <otakon17> Of course Pat gets TWO Venti's
[1:48:57] <Louie_Salmon> Check out the final on her
[1:48:58] <+TopTierHarley> Let Barb dance Pat
[1:48:58] <%dekkitout> And people say Jean is better healer, how?
[1:48:58] <+xeros720> energy is what charges up supers, so she'll be able to super much more often
[1:49:01] <Shion963> just get more dupes
[1:49:03] <scrublord009> DO NOT PAY MONEY, JUST ENJOY THE RPG
[1:49:05] <zeif00> You get another Barbara at 20
[1:49:06] <+lupomancer> Hey, is this game good? I’ve been seeing it everywhere
[1:49:06] <+killer_squid1990> go to their talents too to see their abilities
[1:49:06] <DevinMayCry> Its good
[1:49:06] <otakon17> EXPLODES
[1:49:06] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> I guess the moral of the story is that gachas are always worth it
[1:49:12] <Wauxx00> Its funny how with 150$ you have less than any player who just play the game and grind currency. Prices are dumb
[1:49:13] <+Harro8> Yee Xiangling is great
[1:49:16] <teflonbilly777> Pyronado is a sick move
[1:49:19] <%AzureGale> I wanna give Xiangling some juice :(
[1:49:19] <otakon17> give her THE BIG SPEAR
[1:49:19] <+Domukari> yeah xiang is great
[1:49:21] <+pmtriox> you beefed your tities
[1:49:22] <$BoxNavy> so shes wicked good after you get two more of her
[1:49:26] <Demon_chann> @scrublord009 but i want razooor
[1:49:27] <LoneFonte> @lupomancer fun chill game, don't even spend money on that shit
[1:49:28] <scrublord009> Paimon digivolve to Oppaimon Kappa
[1:49:28] <%Gogogolem> Hey pat do you know about refining weapons?
[1:49:31] <pixelkenj> I set up two parties for all characters
[1:49:33] <DevinMayCry> Feed the dupe spear on Xiangling spear to itself for better skills
[1:49:37] <viciousgrim> so would that skill tree make the game pay to win?
[1:49:38] <chancho4tierra> equip your purple weapons
[1:49:38] <+TopTierHarley> Give her the good spear
[1:49:40] <mortalmanbaby> put new spear on her
[1:49:44] <$BoxNavy> i dont like her chipmunk voice i will say tha
[1:49:44] <gryffinp> there are some enemies who are really weak to water and BOY barbara ruins their fucking lives with her water-type normals
[1:49:45] <$BoxNavy> t
[1:49:45] <+xkczd> Are there other ways to level your character. Or is getting the character in a pack the only way?
[1:49:46] <%Gogogolem> oh good thats super important.
[1:49:46] <lucky_icarus> God, those effects seem too good for this dupe shit. It should be just lame flat stat buffs by like 5%, so it doesn't seem like a necessity.
[1:49:47] <+gustavozxd> boy these voices huh
[1:49:47] <otakon17> yo are currently on fire
[1:49:47] <DevinMayCry> SPEND RESIN
[1:49:48] <%AzureGale> BUTT
[1:49:49] <%dekkitout> Xianglings dive attack looks so dope
[1:49:50] <%maenos2> oh no fire girl is cute
[1:49:52] <+Link232> Make sure to level up Venti et al
[1:49:54] <Demon_chann> are you not gonna level em up?
[1:49:59] <teflonbilly777> EQUIP ARTIFACTS
[1:49:59] <DevinMayCry> A resin at max isnt filling up
[1:49:59] <Rionxgarland> this game feels like a bad idea
[1:50:02] <%ianabstract> feed your characters levelup books
[1:50:02] <+Promessa_EX> and amplify
[1:50:04] <$Invlux> Is there any way to change the aesthetics on the wings?
[1:50:04] <DevinMayCry> REFINE
[1:50:05] <%SirGO0SE> lots of viewers right now
[1:50:06] <teflonbilly777> REFINE
[1:50:07] <$BoxNavy> you can juice it now
[1:50:11] <%SvenHolgersson> THIS GIRL CUTE AS FUCKKKKKK
[1:50:13] <Zombrocom> Man, the voice acting in this game is atrocious
[1:50:14] <Shion963> eat it
[1:50:14] <+gustavozxd> right inside her tits
[1:50:15] <smashingmelonstv> wtf is this?
[1:50:17] <DevinMayCry> You picked the wrong one
[1:50:17] <$spardanwarrior> other one
[1:50:18] <fuji_92> REFINE
[1:50:20] <%DedlokPM> @siontxc no but they can get more passives as you ascend them/increase their max level. Also you can level up most of their talents starting at Adventure Rank 25
[1:50:21] <+Pyroclase> the camera zooms in right through her... hmmm
[1:50:23] <Go4theKnees> is there only an english dub in this?
[1:50:26] <otakon17> RANK 2!
[1:50:27] <%AlphaTauri> ENHANCE
[1:50:29] <+xeros720> a 4% boost
[1:50:33] <mortalmanbaby> not good with her saldy
[1:50:34] <%heartlesshealer> equip the newbies too I guess
[1:50:35] <otakon17> why is Enhance blurred out?
[1:50:36] <$BoxNavy> theres a japanese dub i think
[1:50:36] <Varadox> English, Japanese, and Chinese.
[1:50:38] <gryffinp> There are four different voice tracks so you can set the dub to chinese or japanese if the english voices make you want to die
[1:50:39] <FlamingNarwhal> @Go4theKnees english japanese chinese and korean
[1:50:39] <LoneFonte> @xkczd duplicates is only for perks, you level your character as normal and using xp books (which drop from just playing the game)
[1:50:39] <TheViltsuZ> @Zombrocom English VA's are always atrocious.
[1:50:40] <+omar_uae11> DUDE LEVEL UP UR WEAPONS
[1:50:40] <+JohnXuandou> this game has English, Japanese, Chinese, and I think Korean
[1:50:41] <+agumon9000> @PatStaresAt Xiangling has a good combo where you can combo the end of your light attack string with a charged attack, since the end of your light string is a launcher and the charged attack is a stinger so you can set up loops on weaker enemies
[1:50:43] <gryffinp> Also korean
[1:50:43] <teflonbilly777> @Go4theKnees Nah, weeb too
[1:50:43] <doublinsux> @Go4theKnees Nah, Japanese, Chinese and Korean too
[1:50:44] <%dekkitout> @Rionxgarland Yeah, this game feels like what it was like to watch rwby.... but still fun, this game I mean...
[1:50:44] <%DedlokPM> @Go4theKnees Japanese and Chinese as well
[1:50:45] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> "Debate Club"
[1:50:45] <nintega010> wait is Keqing the virgil cause she can teleport?
[1:50:47] <otakon17> give him...the BIG sword
[1:50:47] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Go4theKnees also JP, chinese, and korean
[1:50:47] <+jiggy_snipe> and Korean
[1:50:48] <Rukasu_Inoru> There's JP voices, Chinese voices and Korean voices as well
[1:50:48] <%AzureGale> The softest edges
[1:50:48] <Varadox> I missed Korean.
[1:50:49] <DevinMayCry> Rainslasher
[1:50:49] <Zayasu> @PatStaresAt why is the screen blurry top left
[1:50:49] <siontxc> @DedlokPM Shut the fuck up R
[1:50:49] <+UltimortalMoth> @lucky_icarus Yeah, Diluc gets so strong with his sixth constellation but he's 5* so if you're f2p you may as well just not bother.
[1:50:53] <%BubbaRands> A fine boy
[1:50:56] <%Bailey__gaming> big sword
[1:50:57] <Zombrocom> @TheViltsuZ That is objectively not true
[1:50:57] <+SilverDevilfish> Debat Club is the only option
[1:50:57] <+sirjonston> equip the yaoi paddle
[1:50:58] <drewslo> edge sword for edge boy
[1:51:00] <$BoxNavy> pat you simply must beef your weapons
[1:51:01] <+SilverDevilfish> ^Debate
[1:51:01] <otakon17> That would pair well with Barbera too
[1:51:02] <+xeros720> hmm, debate club tho
[1:51:03] <%Nekros4442> Sacrificial Greatsword
[1:51:08] <%Saltmeisterr> Why is there a sensor bar?
[1:51:13] <+gustavozxd> please mod the red queen in this game thanks
[1:51:13] <berserkexponent> 2
[1:51:13] <%Saltmeisterr> censor
[1:51:14] <%Saltmeisterr> *
[1:51:14] <%Kincast_Witchy> Sacrificial Sword is very good
[1:51:15] <+zacyzacy> blue one
[1:51:16] <+Harro8> Sacrificial is way better
[1:51:17] <otakon17> SO MANY DEBATE CLUBS
[1:51:18] <gryffinp> Oh I have a bow with that skill cd passive on fischl, it's really good
[1:51:19] <Sotetsu> Cool looking sword
[1:51:19] <+sirjonston> look at this dot hack character
[1:51:20] <+LynbellDaYo> rainslasher
[1:51:20] <%Saltmeisterr> ah
[1:51:25] <%DedlokPM> @siontxc Wat... doodWAT
[1:51:26] <otakon17> ah that's what that is
[1:51:26] <mortalmanbaby> rainslayer
[1:51:26] <%Kincast_Witchy> I use it on Kaeya to proc superconduct very often
[1:51:27] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, username private
[1:51:28] <teflonbilly777> Rainslasher, cause you're already Electro element
[1:51:29] <siontxc> We can see it
[1:51:31] <katocrimson> do you have berserker artifects
[1:51:31] <+Promessa_EX> level them too
[1:51:31] <kikaliq2> ⚰⚰⚰⚰
[1:51:37] <%AzureGale> So that he doesn't accidentally expose any penises
[1:51:37] <+pmtriox> enfuse your weapons i guess
[1:51:39] <mortalmanbaby> STIRNLGES IS SO GOOD
[1:51:40] <%PettyFunk> Rain slasher looks cooler
[1:51:41] <boredpantz> How much money did you drop on this game so far?
[1:51:42] <chancho4tierra> hydro/electro razor does a good combo with barbara
[1:51:42] <$BoxNavy> theres a string right there
[1:51:43] <+TopTierHarley> His best weapon
[1:51:44] <AllenDeadman> Sacrificial is good for characters that keep their skills on the field, like Filsch
[1:51:45] <+xeros720> shit, that's a good bow
[1:51:47] <tonfirean> Cute shorts.
[1:51:48] <FlamingNarwhal> reeealy good bow
[1:51:49] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt dont go do dailies with a lv1 [arty
[1:51:50] <DevinMayCry> Its basically a weapon for him too cause hes a bard
[1:51:51] <Sotetsu> I am waiting to get a 5-star weapon before I start enchanting
[1:51:57] <%FlakkLIVE> Pretty sure that's best-in slot for Fisch and Venti both
[1:51:57] <fuji_92> DAMN THAT'S GOOD
[1:51:58] <%heartlesshealer> What weapon does rock mage lady use?
[1:51:59] <+Jaysky> She eat
[1:52:00] <mortalmanbaby> element damage on venti is my way to play
[1:52:01] <+agumon9000> @PatStaresAt Xiangling has a good combo where you can combo the end of your light attack string with a charged attack, since the end of your light string is a launcher and the charged attack is a stinger so you can set up loops on weaker enemies
[1:52:03] <+zacyzacy> replace ning with barbara
[1:52:03] <%ExpressNode> Pay surely is the pay to win Kappa
[1:52:05] <otakon17> Pebbles da Thrower
[1:52:08] <%Nekros4442> @PatStaresAt It may be a good idea to read Ningguan's skills. They're a bit obfuscated
[1:52:11] <+sirjonston> so many underaged animes
[1:52:11] <+agumon9000> ;(
[1:52:11] <DevinMayCry> A refined 3 star better than a base 4 usually
[1:52:12] <LoneFonte> @legendfather_of_giants wait, why?
[1:52:12] <+TopTierHarley> she use an orb
[1:52:12] <%heartlesshealer> oh she uses the orbs
[1:52:13] <DublinRage> Does it cost anything to refine?
[1:52:14] <pixelkenj> just pump some levels into them, ez
[1:52:15] <$BoxNavy> yes
[1:52:17] <Solidnick18> yeah
[1:52:18] <kikaliq2> Razkr edge is favorite
[1:52:19] <tanarath> you got a.big staff
[1:52:20] <night__monkey> i like how Earth is the worst element in every gacha game LUL
[1:52:20] <+xeros720> yup, geo
[1:52:22] <%Fooguwu> free money you say psaSmug_TK
[1:52:22] <%blitzrush1200> Maybe level them tho
[1:52:24] <DevinMayCry> @DublinRage Just dupes
[1:52:28] <+Harro8> Yee might be worth reading her skills
[1:52:29] <fuji_92> yes
[1:52:29] <tanarath> A big staff
[1:52:30] <%DedlokPM> Yeah she is Geo
[1:52:34] <+TopTierHarley> @DublinRage you must have a dupe
[1:52:34] <teflonbilly777> @DublinRage You need a duplicate weapon and a pittance of money
[1:52:42] <+TopTierHarley> yea read her skills as well
[1:52:43] <+geistuser> How bad is the monetization in this game?
[1:52:44] <andimustmask> dragonslayer book for buff
[1:52:46] <Shion963> there's no good book for Geo I think
[1:52:46] <%legendfather_of_giants> @LoneFonte I mean, if it's a battle daily everybody but his lv20 character will get bodied
[1:52:46] <gryffinp> meanwhile this music
[1:52:47] <+jiggy_snipe> this music lol
[1:52:49] <+Ancopro> check out talents to get an idea

[1:54:06] <AllenDeadman> basically you auto attack and then charge attack with her
[1:54:10] <+BallerSwagBro9k> They need to buff Mage damage

[1:54:25] <AllenDeadman> she is
[1:54:36] <+TopTierHarley> actually B tier is fine
[1:54:41] <+AMagicalFlute> I want to like Xiangling more but her elemental attack is poopoo
[1:54:43] <+sirjonston> bork snuffer
[1:54:43] <happyfacespam> she also has the passive of showing collectables on the minimap

[1:55:06] <happyfacespam> do a charge attack
[1:55:07] <$BoxNavy> at level 1, ues
[1:55:08] <%SvenHolgersson> So is everyone honestly
[1:55:09] <otakon17> she's a caster with timed hits and charged attacks
[1:55:10] <%scrumbotime> @stabbityrabbit I don't like to double up on elements and i got chunni bird summoner for electric
[1:55:10] <%AzureGale> At pat realizes it
[1:55:14] <andimustmask> level one with an unupgraded weapon and no accessories
[1:55:16] <+gustavozxd> her shield and charged attack are really good
[1:55:16] <+zacyzacy> @PatStaresAt shes just weak all the time
[1:55:19] <Shion963> pump her with XP papers
[1:55:26] <Sotetsu> Xianglings kicks ass, she is so fast
[1:55:28] <+Ancopro> big number
[1:55:31] <+Jaysky> @Sotetsu It does not. I was going to recommend it if on PC, but there's extra steps in advanced settings in order to block the current ads.
[1:55:31] <DevinMayCry> Artifacts are big boosts people sleep on
[1:55:31] <+jiggy_snipe> this music
[1:55:32] <+TopTierHarley> Yea she isn't great
[1:55:37] <teflonbilly777> PYRONADO
[1:55:38] <%debugdrawray_> the music is criminally decent
[1:55:39] <Solidnick18> That's so fucking good

[1:55:51] <+mikesapartment> he's large so he doesnt get succ
[1:55:54] <+zacyzacy> too big
[1:55:55] <%JustinPM> this music makes it sound like the end of the world fighting a bunch of jobbers
[1:55:55] <otakon17> no you didn't miss HE'S LEVEL GODDAMN ONE
[1:55:58] <ikantreeed> Venti Ult is OP
[1:56:03] <+Ancopro> and if you throw other elments in there its a fuck
[1:56:04] <Tomschiii> not even one mentioned Qiqi. is she garbage?
[1:56:05] <gryffinp> wind characters definitely seem way worse on enemies too thicc to be juggled
[1:56:06] <ikantreeed> and u can mix it with other elements
[1:56:07] <FlamingNarwhal> it also pulls in small enemies and every element near it
[1:56:08] <fuji_92> he too big
[1:56:12] <+TopTierHarley> @Solidnick18 you got Bennet didn't you lol
[1:56:13] <Shion963> Xiangling is a much better spreader than Diluc holy shit
[1:56:15] <+EmiinV> qiqi's a good healer
[1:56:20] <tanarath> god, this is so anime.
[1:56:20] <stabbityrabbit> @scrumbotime Ohh, yeah that's fair. I really want Jean, but I also really like Anemo protag. No clue what I'm gonna do.
[1:56:22] <Heroes_of_Vale> That was a cool move
[1:56:22] <%AzureGale> WAVE 2 FOOL
[1:56:25] <+TopTierHarley> Qiqi is the best healer
[1:56:27] <FlamingNarwhal> @Tomschiii QIQI is good at what she does
[1:56:31] <Solidnick18> @TopTierHarley yeah he sucks
[1:56:34] <Shion963> CRAZY TALK
[1:56:35] <+gustavozxd> i would play this on pc if they modded nero's voices into razor
[1:56:35] <andimustmask> it's BOTW with actual combat mechanics
[1:56:36] <otakon17> "I got'em!" CRAZY TALK ACTIVATE! "OH SHIT MORE!"
[1:56:38] <pieraao_> The Liyue tracks are super good
[1:56:38] <FlamingNarwhal> if oyu want a healer qiqi is the best choice

[1:56:50] <AllenDeadman> Razor is strong boi
[1:56:51] <+Harro8> Razor is a top tier lightning
[1:56:54] <gryffinp> @PatStaresAt Didn't you give razor a weapon that wasn't level 1 that he took from noelle?
[1:56:54] <teflonbilly777> This is a really good looking game
[1:56:57] <giogio346> where can i see my daily quests?
[1:56:58] <fuji_92> stand time
[1:57:00] <+zacyzacy> @PatStaresAt read rzors charge attack PLEASE
[1:57:02] <+Elixir_Pop> Razor is one of the best DPS right now
[1:57:02] <AllenDeadman> Qiqi is really good
[1:57:04] <Zoh87> @solidnick18 bennet ult is an aoe fire and phys dmg buff that heals, scales with his hp and atk, great as support for another character imo
[1:57:06] <Tomschiii> Qiqi is a healer? thought she was straight damage dealer
[1:57:07] <Smitteys867> Wait, this is a free gacha... action rpg?

[1:57:33] <redapache> Is Razor worth rolling or how do you get him?
[1:57:33] <Shion963> Nero DT
[1:57:33] <+Jaysky> Xiao seems really fun
[1:57:34] <RaidenRising> stando powea
[1:57:36] <OldManDeckardCain> this game is pretty cool, too bad that stupid leak was not true lol
[1:57:37] <+Harro8> BURN THE SHIELD
[1:57:37] <bustawof> it is neros dmc4 dt
[1:57:39] <LoneFonte> FIRE
[1:57:40] <tanarath> @smitteys867 free gatcha botw, don't need to pay at all to win.
[1:57:40] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> what is this devil trigger ass devil trigger
[1:57:45] <teflonbilly777> Burn teh shielfd
[1:57:50] <ItsMarchii> his razor is level 1 so hes doing no damage at all so is his venti
[1:57:53] <%AzureGale> Pat knows what to do
[1:57:54] <%AgniBrandt> Razor's good but I feel like his uncharged R1 has a bit too long of a cooldown for something you're intended to stack
[1:57:55] <otakon17> So Razor is definitely tankier as he has some 1,000 HP compared to the others 800 or so
[1:57:57] <Zombrocom> Razor is just Zwei from SCV
[1:57:59] <yourliteraldog> STAR WOLFNUM
[1:58:00] <scrublord009> Remember wind is amplifier
[1:58:00] <andimustmask> bear wore off before it could hit the shield
[1:58:01] <%vaporousTippler> Is small Guts a Jojo?
[1:58:02] <$BoxNavy> good
[1:58:03] <+demon1103> its too bad Razor is electro-claymore....means he stands no chance if i get a Beidou
[1:58:05] <Varadox> Honestly Amber is best for things like shield destruction.
[1:58:07] <otakon17> Burn the shield, BURN IT!
[1:58:13] <+PenmanLupine> Ning literally throws fire
[1:58:14] <otakon17> NO MO SHIELD FOR YOU
[1:58:15] <Louie_Salmon> It needs a lot of fire, and he can put it out
[1:58:17] <leinadtonu> the archer girl is good in these situations
[1:58:20] <+D00msDayDan> the big boy's shield takes like 3 full fire procs to destroy
[1:58:21] <Varadox> Xiangling is honestly a bit ass.
[1:58:22] <+agumon9000> @PatStaresAt Wind moves gain fire element if used near fire so if you place down the fire and use Venti's wind arrows it will blow the fire into the shield
[1:58:23] <Shion963> Amber sucks most of the time tho
[1:58:25] <+TopTierHarley> lol @demon1103
[1:58:26] <gryffinp> Why are all of the sickest characters in this game lightning type
[1:58:27] <MayorRev> wtf I just got here is pat gambling again
[1:58:29] <Louie_Salmon> You should really level some of these guys, also
[1:58:31] <shcifo> @PatStaresAt tap razers ability it charges up for the hold down button
[1:58:33] <otakon17> it acts like a shotgun
[1:58:35] <scarman125> Beidou is cool but i'd never use her over razor
[1:58:36] <%AzureGale> 15156
[1:58:38] <redapache> How do you get Razor? I like him
[1:58:39] <Louie_Salmon> They're all level 1 and these enemies are level 11
[1:58:40] <reddpop_> the power of 140 dollars
[1:58:41] <$BoxNavy> no hes not
[1:58:43] <beatie_g> @varadox her bunny is also good for drawing away agro. Pretty underrated ngl
[1:58:47] <%AzureGale> Pat becoming a Venti fan confirmed
[1:58:49] <OldManDeckardCain> "kid"
[1:58:51] <Varadox> Razor is Gacha.
[1:58:51] <@SoFarFetched> @redapache he got him through Gacha Kappa
[1:58:51] <ikantreeed> Venti ain't 5 stars for nothing
[1:58:53] <gslayer14> float into aimshot?
[1:58:53] <otakon17> HE CAN RESPAWN HIS SHIEDL!?
[1:58:55] <MayorRev> pat are you fucking gambling again
[1:58:56] <+Kief_Gringo> Bows with weak spot bonus damage are nice too.
[1:58:57] <LoneFonte> @redapache gacha only
[1:59:01] <+TopTierHarley> if you don't charge Venti you lift them instead
[1:59:01] <leinadtonu> cool he can fly up
[1:59:03] <DevinMayCry> He sure can
[1:59:03] <%crimsonharvest> can you cancel the sword spin into golf swing thats what i need
[1:59:05] <%Roundelay11> Venti is literally one of the best characters in the game
[1:59:06] <$BoxNavy> good
[1:59:07] <Varadox> @beatie_g Her Bunny is great for aggro, yeah.
[1:59:08] <%heartlesshealer> get your drops

[1:59:20] <%legendfather_of_giants> @crimsonharvest no
[1:59:21] <+TopTierHarley> Venti is the best char in the game
[1:59:24] <%AzureGale> DOG
[1:59:24] <otakon17> love that baby
[1:59:25] <%rdark_ksu> burn it all down
[1:59:25] <+zacyzacy> read about the charge attacks
[1:59:27] <tactician0> this game is sick
[1:59:28] <WonkierMk2> so when is pat gonna figure out you can combo by switching chracters?
[1:59:30] <DevinMayCry> @crimsonharvest You can cancel and do a finishing move but not sure if tis a golf swing on Razor depends on chracter
[1:59:31] <+TopTierHarley> followed by Diluc

[1:59:49] <stormhawk9891> Amber gets shit on alot but she's still a good utility character
[1:59:54] <$BoxNavy> he will never level his guys
[1:59:54] <+gustavozxd> its doable tho cause the combat is cool
[1:59:55] <%heartlesshealer> don't forget chest
[1:59:57] <fuji_92> venti, diluc, jean and qiqi are kinda the top tiers right now

[2:00:21] <+Promessa_EX> amber can hit weakpoints all day
[2:00:23] <%SvenHolgersson> WELL ITS KILLING ME
[2:00:25] <gryffinp> I mean, I think a character needs more to be good than "the puzzles the devs put in the open world are dependent on her"

[2:02:26] <doublinsux> @AzureGale Marry and Fuck Venti, ignore Fischl and Kill Amber this is the objectively correct option
[2:02:26] <Tomschiii> @Jaysky she looks horribly generic. the games overall design is bad but she is worse^^
[2:02:27] <+Estuko> @ikantreeed my need for Venti become 60x stronger knowing he was a boy.
[2:02:30] <f4ntom98> LANAAAAAA
[2:02:32] <beatie_g> He looks like a rwby character
[2:02:34] <hassanico2> Well also this must be killer on batery life!
[2:02:36] <+Take_2_shots> Lots of Venti's in this here mountain
[2:02:38] <+TopTierHarley> Cause phone is optimized and 60 fps
[2:02:38] <$BoxNavy> yes
[2:02:38] <%DedlokPM> @hassanico2 either you have a really good phone or having a portable plastic and silicone hotplate in your hands
[2:02:41] <+killer_squid1990> It's Ningguang's passive, she points out nearby ore deposits
[2:02:42] <DevinMayCry> Great Swords mine ore quicker chat
[2:02:43] <$BoxNavy> a one chunk
[2:02:45] <mortalmanbaby> better gems south east
[2:02:48] <Ner234> Am I losing my mind or did Twitch change its font?
[2:02:55] <hassanico2> @DedlokPM oh man we can heat sandwiches with this game!
[2:02:58] <+killer_squid1990> that boar fucked you up
[2:03:01] <hassanico2> @Ner234 no itliterally just happened to me too
[2:03:02] <FlamingNarwhal> @Ner234 they changed font
[2:03:03] <+TopTierHarley> it did Ner
[2:03:05] <+burgerdicks> is this his first time playing this?
[2:03:09] <$BoxNavy> you are dead now
[2:03:11] <%DedlokPM> @Ner234 you are not losing your mind
[2:03:11] <Ner234> Ok
[2:03:13] <ikantreeed> @Estuko aye i understand. he's 5 stars too
[2:03:20] <DevinMayCry> Its the work of an enemy stand
[2:03:24] <FlamingNarwhal> @burgerdicks no hes been playing it before streaming
[2:03:31] <JayEarly> did i just hear Steve Blum saying “Danger is ahead?”
[2:03:32] <Louie_Salmon> The characters detail their shit very extensively in the menu
[2:03:37] <hassanico2> So what's the aim of the game?
[2:03:38] <otakon17> they're immune, being FIRE and all
[2:03:38] <LoneFonte> yep, it gives ult charge
[2:03:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> 「Hungry Like The Wolf」
[2:03:39] <TheViltsuZ> DOES THIS GAME HAVE HDR?
[2:03:44] <MasterTonberry23> fighting enemies gives you jack for exp in this game
[2:03:45] <gryffinp> this boy still level 1
[2:03:49] <+Estuko> @ikantreeed I want him so bad, lol. He's great but I've no luck in my pulls for him. AFter getting feqing and qiqi in the same pull, all my gacha luck faded
[2:03:50] <+Jaysky> @Tomschiii Thanks for the opinion! I wildly disagree!
[2:03:53] <otakon17> you needs a heal though man
[2:03:54] <chancho4tierra> yeah razor is allright
[2:03:54] <Ner234> We got Wolf Stands?! Sold
[2:03:59] <%AzureGale> Is Razor basically Z.W.E.I.
[2:03:59] <%crimsonharvest> slime is nonconductive
[2:04:01] <mortalmanbaby> SOUL CALIBER
[2:04:02] <ikantreeed> the mage are meh imo
[2:04:04] <%ashenfrenzy> i just looked at the screen and swore this was the Thunder Herrscher lol
[2:04:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> RAZOR HAS A STAND?!
[2:04:07] <alephalpha> oh it's dog pets you kid
[2:04:07] <+killer_squid1990> also the music in this game fucks
[2:04:08] <stabbityrabbit> Alright, guess I gotta save up for Razor.
[2:04:09] <+gustavozxd> miss LUL
[2:04:10] <+burgerdicks> is this girl just 2b with stand powers? Thats what the running and combos remind me of
[2:04:14] <ikantreeed> the mages in general aren't the best
[2:04:15] <gryffinp> That's the weakest delivery of "Submit!" I've ever heard.
[2:04:15] <hassanico2> Dubbed gacha game... :(
[2:04:16] <Varadox> Razor is Z.W.E.I.
[2:04:21] <Smitteys867> What system is pat playing on?
[2:04:21] <+BallerSwagBro9k> STAND NAME: STEPPENWOLF
[2:04:23] <Animorphimagi> how far in the game is he?
[2:04:24] <ikantreeed> even Mona. she has a useful run tho
[2:04:25] <Ner234> Has Pat Whaled yet? Is he Gacha hell now?
[2:04:26] <doublinsux> @burgerdicks That's a boy I'm pretty sure
[2:04:27] <otakon17> HOW IS A GACHA GAME THIS DAMN PRETTY!?
[2:04:31] <Varadox> @hassanico2 It's in Jap, Eng, Kor, and Ch
[2:04:31] <+gustavozxd> @rumtumtugnutz its more like dmc4 nero DT but yeah that was also a stand
[2:04:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> welp guess that means Lisa can fuck off
[2:04:35] <LoneFonte> thats geo's thing
[2:04:39] <@SoFarFetched> @hassanico2 well he has it in english because he knows people has his stream on in the backround.
[2:04:41] <T_Sasquatch> @ner234 140 dollars
[2:04:42] <teflonbilly777> I wish this was a normal ass game and not gacha. I really dig it, but dear the inevitable paywall in teh future
[2:04:45] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> if this was not a gacha i would be playing it right now
[2:04:45] <Tomschiii> @Jaysky hell, the earth mage alone beats her with ease. not sure why you like amber so much^^
[2:04:47] <+gustavozxd> @otakon17 money from whales from honkai impact
[2:04:47] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> genuinely fucking upset
[2:04:49] <FlamingNarwhal> only blocks projectiles yeah
[2:04:50] <%DedlokPM> @hassanico2 main story hook: Find your lost twin after a cube witch sends you to this world
[2:04:51] <beatie_g> This game is good because the whales are funding the polish
[2:04:57] <%logoth_> Do even enemies eventually put up a fight?
[2:05:00] <$BoxNavy> yahoo
[2:05:06] <Shion963> like hilchurl bombs and such
[2:05:06] <Ner234> @T_Sasquatch Business expenses I see
[2:05:07] <Louie_Salmon> You would be doing so much more damage with just a few books in these characters
[2:05:08] <hassanico2> Ok good to know other languages available cause what I heard so far is average
[2:05:08] <gryffinp> gliding is not faster than running you stupid windy boy
[2:05:14] <0rond> so fichl is a chuuni lightning stand character, and razor is a chuuni lightning stand character, are there any other lightning stand characters I should know about
[2:05:17] <+Estuko> @logoth_ yeah
[2:05:18] <Hasemeow> amazing, a genshin impact ad on a genshin impact stream
[2:05:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> @logoth yea
[2:05:18] <arkv01> holy shit did pat get lucky on gacha or whale?
[2:05:18] <nailwind> enemies get stupidly oppressing later in the game
[2:05:22] <alephalpha> use wold stand boy
[2:05:22] <beatie_g> Why is Venti so annoying
[2:05:25] <alephalpha> he seems cool
[2:05:25] <+burgerdicks> @burgerdicks uh oh
[2:05:26] <Varadox> I love Paimon's English VA.
[2:05:26] <%crimsonharvest> put some ice on it cmon
[2:05:28] <hassanico2> @DedlokPM Alright, but how's the beat to beat gameplay? Do you just... open world explore it?
[2:05:29] <Varadox> She's adorable.
[2:05:31] <ikantreeed> I only bought the 5 dollars daily primo thing. I have Diluc, Venti and Fischl
[2:05:35] <%crimsonharvest> oh there isnt any
[2:05:37] <Shion963> @hassanico2 JP, Kor, CN
[2:05:40] <+BigBruthaThunda> his firing doesn't look any different than Amber's to me?
[2:05:41] <T_Sasquatch> @sashagreenspiderqueen if you preregisterd it gives you a ton of free shit. I've 5 different characters free. Just control yourself. Gambling is for idiots
[2:05:43] <teflonbilly777> @beatie_g Cause you can't find his vagina
[2:05:44] <TheViltsuZ> @Varadox That's a dude
[2:05:46] <+Jaysky> @Tomschiii Her color scheme, ribbon, hair are far better for me. ^^
[2:05:48] <stabbityrabbit> @0rond Do you count Lisa's lamp as a stand?
[2:05:49] <Ner234> Let doggo snore
[2:05:54] <doublinsux> @burgerdicks Happens to the best of us don't worry
[2:05:57] <simifu> Hey pat, make a reroll account Kappa
[2:06:00] <+sirjonston> fat boy want to fat snore
[2:06:00] <MasterTonberry23> @ikantreeed way to suck all the luck out of the universe and leave the rest of us with none
[2:06:02] <+TopTierHarley> He is a better character than AMber
[2:06:04] <+TopTierHarley> chat is blind
[2:06:05] <arkv01> @TheViltsuZ shhh an insignificant detail
[2:06:12] <beatie_g> @teflonbilly777 he’d still be just as annoying as a girl
[2:06:18] <redapache> man I really like this game but "Go rescue sibling you don't really know" is such a weak start in the player's perspective in my opinion
[2:06:21] <TheViltsuZ> GOING TO DOWNLOAD THIS GAME RIGHT NOW IT'S ONLY 12GB AND FREE OMG
[2:06:21] <1matheuw> chest?
[2:06:21] <+vampireinarm> so how much has Pat spent on waifu boxes?

[2:06:37] <gryffinp> @PatStaresAt go back to that cryo regisvine and prove that
[2:06:41] <+gustavozxd> you don't need to overlevel yourself to win
[2:06:41] <doublinsux> Venti's Ultimate already makes him a better character than Amber
[2:06:42] <hassanico2> Is this on PC or do I gotta use Bluestacks?
[2:06:43] <ikantreeed> @MasterTonberry23 No don't worry i use the luck I need in myreal life to full my video game luck NotLikeThis
[2:06:45] <Tomschiii> noone expected a good story in such games
[2:06:46] <%DedlokPM> @hassanico2 there are story quests and they are also locked to your Adventure Rank, which is increased by exploring, finding things, doing quests, and running the dungeons
[2:06:47] <Louie_Salmon> But you could do things faster

[2:08:43] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Woolie would probably like Razor
[2:08:44] <0rond> @PatStaresAt are you deliberately withholding the identity of the nero due to spoilers?

[2:08:49] <0rond> blink 3 times for no

[2:08:51] <siontxc> @xkczd Were you not listening to what he just said? Fucking idiot
[2:08:57] <Shion963> cycling energy after charge?
[2:08:58] <+TopTierHarley> @Teyaric use books to level up, innate stuff you need dupes

[2:09:26] <otakon17> you did hear an AWOO
[2:09:27] <TheViltsuZ> I hope the wolf stand gets bigger when you level up.
[2:09:28] <+MrJadeK> MrJadeK subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:09:29] <hassanico2> No you heard an AWOOGA
[2:09:29] <siontxc> ;-;
[2:09:29] <+xkczd> @siontxc maybe because my stream may be behind u fucking idiot
[2:09:34] <otakon17> Razor is our AWOO lad
[2:09:35] <fuji_92> razor is wolf boy
[2:09:40] <%GutsForDinner> so far this looks like botw but with actual combat mechanics
[2:09:42] <arkv01> I dunno any game with BOTW grass gets compared to it
[2:09:43] <Ner234> awoooooo
[2:09:44] <%AzureGale> Razor needs food badly
[2:09:45] <hassanico2> Do you think a potato laptop can run this?
[2:09:46] <+EmiinV> every time you E he gains ult energy faster so spam it
[2:09:49] <Teyaric> And since you're... NOT getting dupes for the stupid-rares, they're basically worthless. Amazing.
[2:09:49] <%dekkitout> Except you CAN climb while raining here
[2:09:50] <+burgerdicks> @Jaysky just the stand i think
[2:09:51] <otakon17> because you're LEVEL ONE YOU MOOK!
[2:09:51] <+Pyroclase> honestly this game looks better than BOTW
[2:09:53] <@SoFarFetched> @xkczd @siontxc both of you knock it off.
[2:09:53] <0rond> send woolie gameplay of razor and beidou to get him into genshin 100%
[2:09:55] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> you have healer
[2:09:55] <+Lord_of_all_Edges> breath of the weeb
[2:09:58] <+LynbellDaYo> The game needs an indicator for low health
[2:09:59] <BrickleBork> I enjoy this game :)
[2:10:00] <%NovaKnightmare> I thought it was the playing as a twink
[2:10:00] <TheViltsuZ> BOTW with better graphics and frame rate above 20.
[2:10:02] <Zayasu> is the main character not good?
[2:10:03] <otakon17> well it's running on PC for one
[2:10:03] <Shion963> level the boy up, Pat
[2:10:05] <yourliteraldog> the colors screem breath of the wild
[2:10:08] <%crimsonharvest> does grass fire make updrafts you can fly on
[2:10:10] <otakon17> it's a gorgeous game
[2:10:11] <%Jaxnos> Noelle straight up has the Goron shield as well. and my brain has me convinced it makes the same sound
[2:10:13] <hassanico2> Ah wait is this that gacha model where you need 5 copies to make something worthwhile?
[2:10:14] <quietshun> @teyaric not true
[2:10:15] <$Caped_Eggy> Weeb of the wild LUL
[2:10:16] <happyfacespam> best thing about this game: your weapons don't break after 5 seconds of use
[2:10:16] <+redjack108> Yo, the music is actually kinda cool.
[2:10:19] <otakon17> how come our lad hasn't leveled up yet?
[2:10:22] <FlamingNarwhal> @Zayasu main character is good. solid a tier
[2:10:25] <doublinsux> @PatStaresAt Am I gonna find out you're playing fucking shit like Arknights or Girls Frontline in a week now that you're playing this gacha shit?
[2:10:28] <teflonbilly777> @Pyroclase I played BoTW on Wii U so it runs better at a higher resolution too
[2:10:33] <+D00msDayDan> @Caped_Eggy please, it's breath of the waifu
[2:10:34] <Ner234> I hope they announce Switch news soon. It's the only platform I own that can run this.
[2:10:34] <+LynbellDaYo> @Zayasu the main character is actually pretty good
[2:10:35] <TheViltsuZ> @Caped_Eggy Zelda is weeb as hell dude
[2:10:36] <Louie_Salmon> @crimsonharvest No, but a character he got has revali's gale
[2:10:39] <ToneBacas> LUL this is just Nier Automata after all
[2:10:40] <gryffinp> Pat has decided to be very silly and not level his mans
[2:10:41] <MasterTonberry23> you dont get much exp for monster killls

[2:11:09] <GeltonZ> Makes sense, his super isn't SUPER super. Seems like adequate time.
[2:11:10] <+EmiinV> most end game builds for razor are designed to keep him in ult with near 100% uptime
[2:11:10] <Louie_Salmon> If only you weren't level 1

[2:11:48] <%DedlokPM> @Zayasu not really that great. All the other Wind/Ameno users are better than Main Character. Some say the main character can be the best geo user, but that is more of a statement on the viability of the geo users than the viability of the Main Character
[2:11:49] <+LynbellDaYo> venti does indeed have cock and balls
[2:11:50] <+BallerSwagBro9k> ITS A BOY

[2:16:05] <Ner234> Visibly seeing Pat taking DoTs from a migraine.
[2:16:11] <0rond> having more than one waifu will ruin your laifu
[2:16:12] <%legendfather_of_giants> @arkv01 the problem is you have no other way to get their upgrades
[2:16:19] <teflonbilly777> They're all waifus in the dark

[2:17:23] <gryffinp> So is this now genshin general chat
[2:17:29] <+victhebeard> I feel like Pat's whole break down should posted some place.
[2:17:34] <%legendfather_of_giants> @arkv01 honestly, I don't know why FGO is always the comparison. That game is way easier to F2P and has way better rates/value than something like the smt game
[2:17:35] <SilverFaustX> did the stream f before it ended?
[2:17:37] <Ner234> Welp back to Granblue I guess
