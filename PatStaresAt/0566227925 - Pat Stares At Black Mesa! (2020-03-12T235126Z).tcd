[0:40:50] <%Jolnir> Patmans Mind
[0:40:51] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @barkon345 yes, but it's fully finished now
[0:40:52] <j0ustar> wouldn't lowering the resolution a bit help the CC?
[0:40:52] <Man_in_the_Red> @barkon345 they finally finished Xen and its sick
[0:40:54] <+Javaa01> You get to see the generators and this chopper
[0:40:54] <boomstickery> @PatStaresAt can you increase text size in the console?
[0:40:55] <$Ziegsy> You can see limsa from there
[0:40:55] <%Louie_Salmon> Quick, source wizards, is there a command console thing for text size?
[0:40:56] <%asgard147> YOU'RE NOT MY BOSS ROBOT!! limesHeck
[0:40:56] <+beanthelogan> SourPls
[0:40:56] <%RedKnightVI> Pat, you might want to bump it up to Black Mesa difficulty. Normal in this game is pretty much easy mode
[0:40:58] <%spiritofmojave> Pat's mind
[0:40:58] <OwlLightningMage> This game needs more zombies
[0:41:03] <GarettLefebvre> nice nvidia shadowplay fps counter in the top corner
[0:41:04] <hat_under_bread> This is a masterclass in how NOT to do subtitles. Holy crap.
[0:41:05] <%rytyoung> I'm outta this train YEET

[1:41:57] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt So I haven't heard a goddamn thing about this game until you mentioned it a few days ago. Is this a fan thing or did Valve back it?
[1:41:57] <%AncelDeLambert> whack whack whack
[1:41:58] <Oxybe> vavue narrative and terrible building code
[1:41:59] <$lotharrio> Oh wait, there's a proper term... Scenario.

[1:42:01] <%Rawklobstah88> Gun
[1:42:03] <Man_in_the_Red> @anceldelambert it played suring the resonance cascade, you missed it
[1:42:06] <dukenux> It's a theme park ride, in best meaning of that word
[1:42:06] <%Tman451> It went even further than Unreal did, it was insane at the time
[1:42:07] <%461dragonman461> So what's the difference between this version and the old Black Mesa?
[1:42:07] <$lotharrio> Half Life had proper scenarios.

[1:49:07] <%LethargicRush> thats why it was so hard
[1:49:09] <TheArrow_> i was not tricked because i could tell you were just pretending :)
[1:49:12] <%KitsuneManami> @PatStaresAt Why did those guys become Good Guys later?
[1:49:12] <%nofestu2> I have been bamboozled

[1:57:52] <%SvenHolgersson> Paige isn't a robot Pat RUDE
[1:57:53] <%chaumiester> @PaladinDupre No it's not... It's a SPAS-12. Unless you're making a joke
[1:57:53] <%LethargicRush> its a shame they dont recognize him as the one free man yet
[1:57:54] <dukenux> It's so good it can shoot two round from a single barrel

[1:58:14] <troxvon_the_lesser> @chaumiester It tecnically shouldn't have two barrels cause it's a SPAZ 12 but value made it have a 2 shot alt fire
[1:58:15] <KeystoneA1> they modeled it to look like the original HL1 shotty
[1:58:17] <%twistedj3ster> Paige can't be a robot, her lgic circuits are fried
[1:58:21] <$Chimeraelite> modeled after a SPAS-12 I think?

[2:10:02] <+santafer> she cant die if she is dead

[2:12:10] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Valve is the key

[2:12:36] <%IMDRanged> Speed run
[2:12:41] <KeystoneA1> Paige isn't playing so woman is safe
[2:12:42] <%DensityD> now adjust the meat
[2:12:45] <+santafer> not really
[2:12:45] <%LethargicRush> a VALVE
[2:12:45] <+EmotionalFatGuy> what Elmo thinks is most important
[2:12:46] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Pat isnt Paige,

[2:13:08] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt my friend just started their first re game with remake 1, what advice should i give them
[2:13:10] <+santafer> Freeman¬¥s Mind Goblins
[2:13:11] <Jkhmn12> nah pat morality is an artificial concept
[2:13:20] <FrankysDream> it's because she's a woman and that's page's thing
[2:13:22] <+santafer> just chemicals
[2:13:24] <%DensityD> perfect, drop your shield
[2:13:25] <Kirbachev> @NopeBadguy none, let them figure it out
[2:13:29] <%DensityD> you know what I mean?
[2:13:40] <%peachy996> @NopeBadguy routes are key
[2:13:48] <chronoxgp> I'm going to coome
[2:13:54] <red_blaster> Cheat
[2:14:01] <xxdj1173xx> as someone who has never played half life before what makes these games so good?
[2:14:03] <%heartlesshealer> use saves to scout
[2:14:05] <Melchior_the_Wise> that puzzle took me for ever, because I didn't see the opening for the vent
[2:14:07] <%peachy996> pretty much
[2:14:08] <KaliasTV> Pat giving other people goblins
[2:14:09] <%ssjklyco> Play it like it's old dark soulds
[2:14:10] <Reizie_Etherealm> Save scum got it
[2:14:11] <%XeroSigmaPrime> DONT USE A GUIDE FOR REMAKE
[2:14:12] <%xUmbraNinja> Knife everything
[2:14:13] <%PaladinDupre> alternatively run and gun like a cowboy leeroy jenkins
[2:14:15] <%NopeBadguy> that's p good, i did that all the time
[2:14:17] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> does Pat ever give legit advice? I can n get tell
[2:14:18] <TurtleButter> Savescum?
[2:14:19] <Coystick> Pat you have to know that's not the intended experience, YOU PLAY WRONG
[2:14:19] <dukenux> save scumming is a legitimate tactic
[2:14:20] <%DensityD> the level design is nice, the gunplay is well developed
[2:14:21] <FrankysDream> that legit spooked me
[2:14:23] <theshillman> just got here, are the bullsquid squid still alive?
[2:14:25] <ThirdPersonPhil> So play the game 2 times.... got it
[2:14:27] <+parzano> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat hows the gamer cube?
[2:14:37] <Dfreddy8> Pat can't even give Pat good advice.
[2:14:39] <DXLelouch24> Pat you dont need to savescum Re2Remake until your aiming for the infinite Rocket Launcher
[2:14:41] <Visorak6> HL was basically the game that kicked off cutscenes that dont remove you from the game environment
[2:14:47] <dukenux> and then she froze to death
[2:14:47] <marvel877> RE games are like Mega Man games, you're gonna die a bunch till you learn the patterns/layout/weaknesses.
[2:14:48] <$lotharrio> @xxdj1173xx Nothing that seems spectacular now. When they came out, they advanced FPS games dramatically. With different scenarios playing out, different genre feels, etc.
[2:14:53] <Peqead> what weird fuckin advice
[2:14:57] <theshillman> wait, this isnt the freezer room
[2:14:58] <DXLelouch24> i say this as someone that unlocked it
[2:14:58] <DSD24> @xxdj1173xx Its the immersion the game puts you in there's no cutscenes just you playing the game and experiencing the story
[2:15:01] <DXLelouch24> it was a bitch to do
[2:15:01] <chronoxgp> this is like a playground for pat

[2:15:20] <dukenux> 1600
[2:15:21] <%DensityD> how long ago was the resonance cascade? how long does it take a barnacle to get into position?
[2:15:21] <KeystoneA1> their AI got reworked and they're fun to fight now
[2:15:22] <+Thomzzz> wait is black mesa officially completed!!???
[2:15:23] <laserbeaming> Pat, if you can fuck a Digimon, can you fuck a Vortigaunt?

[2:15:24] <%Aeoneth> You gonna come back to this at a later date?
[2:15:25] <Varadox> @DXLelouch24 It was in reference to the original RE1 Remake, not RE2Make.

[2:19:11] <Jack8274> @EmotionalFatGuy I think the suit recycles it in cannon

[2:19:40] <trianglehat> makes sense
[2:19:41] <+Javaa01> Not tripmines
[2:19:41] <KeystoneA1> @Visorak6 It does. A scientist in the first chapter mentions the suit's waste recycling.
[2:19:43] <Jack8274> LUL We all did that

[2:35:59] <RyanTheRecluse> @patstaresat As someone who never played the original half life, is this the best way to experience it or the source port?
[2:36:00] <%goose_attack_almanac> @necrocannibal2 There was a thing, summit, meeting etc. where one of the attendees had Corona. Trudeau and his wife are now locked down for now.
[2:36:00] <+Cityscape17> I didnt
[2:36:01] <Neo_Kaiser> "Let go, just let go"

[2:36:08] <theshillman> wait, how is Trudeau going to abuse canadas natives now?
[2:36:16] <+Javaa01> @BurdRightsActivist Or is he isolating so he can commit MORE blackface outside of the public eye?

[2:36:20] <%OToole42> this or original, half life source is jank
[2:36:21] <pennykettle_> @Mitchellsocks its so easy to go in circles there its insane. way later in the game
[2:36:22] <KeystoneA1> @RyanTheRecluse The source version is ass. This or the original are the best way.
[2:36:25] <dukenux> I think it goes: OG HL > This >>> source remake

[2:54:44] <%Frost_Quill> ZONE-tan
[2:54:45] <Man_in_the_Red> @lotharrio theres also a ton of confidential info in the facility so if the disaster vlows over, but everythings out of the bag it'll cause some firings
[2:54:49] <pennykettle_> dukenux bless
[2:54:51] <DSD24> To be fair Pat's playing this like Freeman's Mind
[2:54:54] <trianglehat> big brain
[2:55:01] <ovan20> @SpicyCheeseNips it's the engine on which it's made.
[2:55:04] <$ItsRatman> damn he didnt fall for it, that got me big time
[2:55:08] <MiskatonicAlum> pretty sneaky sis
[2:55:12] <Man_in_the_Red> clean the whole place, make it pure, with nuclear weaponry
[2:55:16] <dukenux> oh look, Crowbar-chan's friend
[2:55:23] <%derekwst3> take the toilet paper, the worlds running out of it
[2:55:28] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> two ways down this elevator shaft
[2:55:29] <%pepzi_boyz> pepzi_boyz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! the last podcast felt like 2 people I barely know ignoring me in a discord call, but in a good way
[2:55:30] <%PunishedMercer_> press the big red button
[2:55:36] <%PunishedMercer_> wipe the slate clean
[2:55:41] <dukenux> neat effects
[2:55:43] <$floralkami> FUUNIIIIIIIIIIIII JOKE
[2:55:45] <Captain_Joe1911> BOP cakee5Tuntun
[2:55:50] <natebud> I hope they improved the soldier AI, last time I played you could beat them by just standing still and headshotting them.
[2:55:53] <Cpl_Elemena> what engine is this made on?
[2:55:59] <Monkeyweed21> Would you fuck a headcrab?
[2:56:01] <+RioGascar> source
[2:56:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> @cpl_elemena Source
[2:56:01] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> alternate route
[2:56:03] <am_omega> HL2 engine.
[2:56:06] <$floralkami> @cpl_elemena Source, the OG
[2:56:10] <%koffeemancer> Oh shit, did someone gift me a sub? i must've missed it getting my ass beat by velkhana. psaBig thank you to whoever gifted
[2:56:10] <%JohnAtDawn> Oh hey, it's the Ravenloft demo level
[2:56:11] <SchroedingersFerret> Imagine evolving to be hat-shaped
[2:56:12] <Melchior_the_Wise> think you'll make it outside?
[2:56:15] <%leinadtonu> SMRT
[2:56:20] <+RioGascar> this is basically a swan song for source
[2:56:24] <%damienlunas> imagine if there wasn't a ladder down and Gordon just trapped himself like an idiot
[2:56:28] <chronoxgp> can't beleive he didn't just scroll to grenade in a source engine game
[2:56:32] <Cpl_Elemena> is therw a new Source engine because this seems cleaner than the old one
[2:56:33] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> oh yeah
[2:56:33] <+Javaa01> I love how the medkits in this area have an older design then the main research facility
[2:56:34] <dukenux> fake ladder
[2:56:34] <+RioGascar> Woth half life alyx launching map making tools
[2:56:35] <+SpicyCheeseNips> I would keep a headcrab as a pet, as long as it was defanged.
[2:56:36] <Grennold> Half-Life always reminded me of Die Hard. Joe Everyman gets caught up in a massive clusterfuck and everyone's trying to kill him
[2:56:39] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> the rails
[2:56:40] <%mak0t0yukii> What a dump
[2:56:49] <+RioGascar> there is source 2 but no sdk exists yet
[2:56:54] <Grennold> And he crawls around in vents a lot
[2:56:56] <$lotharrio> ...wait a second, what did headcrabs parasitize in their home dimension? Vortigaunts don't have the right head shape for them.
[2:56:57] <Zebroneath> This tram looks a lot better than the original
[2:56:58] <natebud> This layout is way different than the original
[2:56:59] <Melchior_the_Wise> The game is slightly different from the original, it's not 1 to 1
[2:57:04] <%RedKnightVI> For what it's worth, it's a bit... different now
[2:57:05] <+RioGascar> only 2 games are running it right now
[2:57:07] <dukenux> @Grennold it's very much Die Hard + The Myst
[2:57:07] <Khorneflakes_> cohhD max speed
[2:57:09] <theshillman> NOOOOOOO
[2:57:09] <electricdynamite> You aren't going to play Operation: Raccoon City
[2:57:10] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> heh
[2:57:10] <%Pyroclase> @PatStaresAt after this you do apprehension, then residue processing, then questionable ethics, then surface tension
[2:57:12] <%YourFavoriteShiba> choo choooooo
[2:57:12] <wrydiculous> aww yea the kart
[2:57:12] <+RioGascar> dota 2, and half life alyx
[2:57:12] <v_o_m_i_t> pOG
[2:57:13] <KeystoneA1> @Cpl_Elemena they made this on source. Alyx and Source 2 are later this month though.
[2:57:14] <+TheSaintJohn> big speed max number
[2:57:15] <$floralkami> @cpl_elemena nope, it was just worked on through the years. Source 2 is set to come soon with the release of HL Alyx, tho
[2:57:17] <theshillman> not the hecking pupperinos
[2:57:17] <+SpicyCheeseNips> remember to jump off
[2:57:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> FULL SPEED AHEAD!
[2:57:22] <%damienlunas> I don't think a Doctor of Theoretical Physics counts as an everyman
[2:57:27] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> CHOO CHOO
[2:57:27] <Cpl_Elemena> ah cool thanks y'all
[2:57:30] <dukenux> DEJA VU
[2:57:31] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> LUL
[2:57:31] <Revan175757> i recomend saving
[2:57:31] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> !uptime
[2:57:32] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 57m.
[2:57:34] <+TheSaintJohn> bonk
[2:57:36] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> nani
[2:57:36] <warmnoid> gas gas gas
[2:57:38] <+Javaa01> No yeets today
[2:57:39] <Huntercd> Are headcrabs edible?
[2:57:41] <$lotharrio> So much free XP
[2:57:43] <+SpicyCheeseNips> Nahh it's fiiiine.
[2:57:43] <moonmeh> nah
[2:57:45] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> not in the budget
[2:57:49] <Man_in_the_Red> headcrabs are edible
[2:57:50] <%PaladinDupre> FART GAS
[2:57:51] <CuttleCrow> not your job
[2:57:54] <dukenux> if you stay on that train you get YEETED right into that sludge
[2:57:55] <Melchior_the_Wise> the toxic waste pool is part of the budget
[2:57:56] <MiskatonicAlum> kinda late now
[2:57:56] <am_omega> I like the theory that Gordon faked his credentials so he can get a amazing job.
[2:57:57] <$lotharrio> Throw a sheet over it.
[2:57:57] <theshillman> MTN Dew
[2:57:57] <+EmotionalFatGuy> That's just Surge left over from the 90's
[2:57:57] <Man_in_the_Red> theres one on a spit later on
[2:57:58] <SchroedingersFerret> Not a real ladder
[2:57:58] <SivSarcast> Sometimes you take electric damage from the tracks, sometimes you don't. It's unclear.
[2:57:59] <+SpicyCheeseNips> A little radiation never killed nobody.
[2:58:02] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> glowy
[2:58:07] <red_blaster> Do they skip the entire on Rails level in Black Mesa?
[2:58:13] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> no
[2:58:15] <+RioGascar> No
[2:58:16] <natebud> Even before the cascade there was still a river of toxis waste
[2:58:18] <pennykettle_> all this bio slime is making me thirsty
[2:58:18] <+RioGascar> Its cut down tho
[2:58:22] <wrydiculous> as a kid, stages with radioactive liquid made me nauseous as shit
[2:58:23] <$lotharrio> Infamously murderous HL ladders.
[2:58:24] <am_omega> I bet they had massive benefits and massive pay in Black Mesa.
[2:58:27] <+SpicyCheeseNips> Spitty boi
[2:58:29] <dukenux> @red_blaster i think it's a bit shorter, though it was a while sine i played
[2:58:30] <dashmatt> crouch sprint
[2:58:32] <%PunishedMercer_> splorch
[2:58:33] <ShichiNoBushi> THE Freeman
[2:58:33] <+TheSaintJohn> bullsquid
[2:58:33] <%StaceMcGate> Hunt down the Freeman
[2:58:34] <Huntercd> Look at all these safety violations
[2:58:34] <%Pyroclase> he beat that shit
[2:58:36] <Revan175757> Jizz in the face :D
[2:58:36] <theshillman> bullsquid acute
[2:58:37] <+emperri> odd's world
[2:58:38] <$floralkami> get nutted on
[2:58:38] <Melchior_the_Wise> You think this would be a good introduction for someone who never played Half-Life before?
[2:58:44] <eckskyuucow> Bullsquids are bullshit
[2:58:45] <%shinydemonguy> yeah, that thing..
[2:58:48] <arran_throttle> They are super from oddworld
[2:58:48] <dukenux> yes
[2:58:50] <+SpicyCheeseNips> Hell yeah
[2:58:52] <am_omega> Yes this would be a good introduction.
[2:58:52] <%ssjklyco> When's Half Life and Death of Gordon Froman?
[2:58:53] <pennykettle_> @Melchior_the_Wise yes its literally just the first game, play it, its amazing
[2:58:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> @melchior_the_wise It's a remake of the first one, so yes.
[2:58:55] <trianglehat> EH
[2:58:57] <deviljhojho_> tragic, really
[2:58:57] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> cool
[2:58:57] <%Pyroclase> noooo
[2:59:00] <dukenux> eeeh
[2:59:00] <%Pyroclase> play HL2 as well
[2:59:00] <%peachy996> Heloo
[2:59:01] <CuttleCrow> HL1 frantic crowbar whacking is just so good
[2:59:01] <theKingRamses> what
[2:59:01] <dashmatt> agreed
[2:59:02] <%BlueMoonBlues> Big no
[2:59:02] <+RioGascar> i mean half life 1 is a pretty good introduction into fps
[2:59:03] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> mmm
[2:59:03] <ShichiNoBushi> Until Alyx?
[2:59:04] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah
[2:59:04] <+SpicyCheeseNips> With no payoff
[2:59:06] <%crimsonharvest> its also TALKING TALKING TALKING
[2:59:07] <%lionmanguy> And this isn't?
[2:59:07] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt this doesn't have a gravity gun tho
[2:59:07] <+Andrizzleton> b-but Dog
[2:59:07] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> you're not wrong
[2:59:08] <deviljhojho_> UNLIMITED CLIFFHANGER WORKS
[2:59:09] <ScreamLord> Yeah
[2:59:10] <%mak0t0yukii> When's Half Life Alyx Pat?
[2:59:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> point
[2:59:11] <+SpicyCheeseNips> SIIIIICK
[2:59:11] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> cool
[2:59:11] <Tucker0603> rad
[2:59:12] <SivSarcast> Half Life 2's pretty long too, and I'm the guy who likes long games.
[2:59:12] <%Mr_Strut> but gravity gun
[2:59:12] <jeffishype> COOL GUY
[2:59:12] <Monkeyweed21> pat the health
[2:59:13] <ThatGuyThere03> niiiicccccce
[2:59:13] <Visorak6> You missed batteries
[2:59:13] <Revan175757> Get fucked
[2:59:13] <$floralkami> YEAH
[2:59:14] <ithirstforfreddurst> Half Life 1 > Black Mesa. suck it zoomers
[2:59:14] <+derrigible> did you just slide?
[2:59:14] <%xcompleasedad> BRUH
[2:59:15] <+TheSaintJohn> HL2 and its episodes still hold up
[2:59:16] <%the_vedo_show> true
[2:59:16] <majima666> get rekt
[2:59:16] <+KeepoKompany> @melchior_the_wise I never play a HL game before. I bought this and love it
[2:59:17] <%Pyroclase> even the episode 3 leak ended on a cliffhangar ffs
[2:59:17] <+RioGascar> Excuse me what?
[2:59:18] <trianglehat> HL2 is better tho
[2:59:19] <Monkeyweed21> BLIND
[2:59:19] <ThatGuyThere03> DESTINY 2 SHIT
[2:59:19] <sambone_z> ravenholm was fun
[2:59:20] <DSD24> Hey Pat play Half Life 3
[2:59:20] <Man_in_the_Red> Black Mesa at least has an ending of sorts
[2:59:21] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> BLAT
[2:59:21] <Finakala> Fuck that bulllsquid in particular
[2:59:21] <pennykettle_> All of HL2 and episodes are worth playing even if the story doesnt resolve
[2:59:22] <+RioGascar> No play half life 2
[2:59:23] <ThatGuyThere03> i saw that
[2:59:25] <MiskatonicAlum> and HL2 is really just an engine demo
[2:59:25] <marvel877> NON STOP INFINITE CLIFFHANGER ACTION
[2:59:27] <theKingRamses> half life 2 is still bomb
[2:59:28] <Monkeyweed21> SO BLIND
[2:59:29] <SivSarcast> The floor is radioactive waste!
[2:59:29] <LeftOverPizza13> anyone else thought of titan chimpanzee with that slide shotty
[2:59:30] <TrollKing96> And this isn't?
[2:59:31] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> still enjoy HL2 tho
[2:59:32] <+TheSaintJohn> play this and HL2
[2:59:33] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> If you like this and its world, consider 2, but I think this is the best
[2:59:33] <Rostichenburg> Every Half Life thing ends with a cliffhanger
[2:59:33] <natebud> I was a little let down by how easy this remake was
[2:59:36] <%XeroSigmaPrime> HL2 IS AWESOME THO
[2:59:38] <CuttleCrow> the Dew factory
[2:59:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> Welcome to the cancer room!
[2:59:38] <d00hicky2> Anyone play any good single player source mods?
[2:59:41] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Hey do you think this series cliffhanger event be a case file in control, like a glimpse universe meld?
[2:59:43] <$floralkami> YOU SPIT ACID? I SPIT HOT LEAD
[2:59:43] <%StaceMcGate> Add a gravity gun and ravenholme to this game and maybe you have a case
[2:59:48] <CloniiCory> The only Half Life Game you need to play is Hunt Down the Freeman.
[2:59:49] <+SpicyCheeseNips> Yucky spit boys
[2:59:49] <dukenux> So this is why they did in Black Mesa. Produced Mtn Dew.
[2:59:49] <yourwaifuispoop> this game also ends in a clifhanger
[2:59:52] <Varadox> @d00hicky2 Nightmare House 1 and 2?
[2:59:54] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> clicky boi
[2:59:55] <+eggstyr0ne> half life 2 ends the same way half life 1 does
[2:59:55] <dukenux> *what
[2:59:55] <+RioGascar> Half life 2 is a massive step forward in narrative story telling for games
[2:59:58] <%Pyroclase> did they get rid of the screen static effect near radiation?
[2:59:59] <theshillman> pat should do a special corona stream of deus ex
[2:59:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> Man Freeman's mind lines keep poping into my head
[3:00:02] <BoneofMalkav> Only thing that would be left to do is to port HL1 mods over to this.
[3:00:04] <arran_throttle> should we tell Pat about the hidden karma and XP system?
[3:00:05] <theKingRamses> what
[3:00:05] <Man_in_the_Red> @d00hicky2 Cry of Fear (?)
[3:00:06] <%crimsonharvest> same doc oc
[3:00:09] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt You ever seen Freeman's Mind?
[3:00:10] <dukenux> every hl ends on one
[3:00:11] <KeystoneA1> @d00hicky2 Technically Vampire The Masquerade is a source mod
[3:00:11] <%ssjklyco> Who is the G Man?
[3:00:11] <eckskyuucow> I'd say Black Mesa > OG > Source > 2 and its episodes
[3:00:12] <sambone_z> no Ravenholm tho
[3:00:12] <dashmatt> crazy talk
[3:00:13] <Revan175757> Status: Hired
[3:00:14] <MiskatonicAlum> the same way like, the matrix or back to the future end in a cliff hanger
[3:00:15] <oruandrew> isnt portal related to black mesa?
[3:00:16] <Melchior_the_Wise> I've played all the half-life games except the original until Black mesa, but it's so old at this point many people haven't experienced it.
[3:00:17] <+EmotionalFatGuy> The cliffhanger is that it never ended
[3:00:18] <%ssjklyco> That is a cliff hanger
[3:00:19] <%Pyroclase> it's as defiunitive as blowing up the citadel in HL2
[3:00:23] <pennykettle_> this game barely has a story, hard to have a cliffhanger
[3:00:23] <MiskatonicAlum> a satisfactory cliffhanger
[3:00:23] <majima666> i dont remember if i ever completed this. i completed the blue shift expansion though
[3:00:23] <Galacta_Pieta> Its a satisfying what is gonna happen type of ending than whatever we're stuck with in hl2
[3:00:24] <Coystick> MANY PUPPOS
[3:00:24] <%crimsonharvest> i constantly rewatch it lol
[3:00:25] <DSD24> Always reference Freeman's mind
[3:00:25] <d00hicky2> Oooh i like horror
[3:00:26] <Grennold> Wow look at this amazing toxic waste dump
[3:00:26] <ThatGuyThere03> Pat knows about the class system...right?
[3:00:27] <natebud> The machine gun is way too good in this game too
[3:00:30] <%StaceMcGate> Who is ready for Half Life: Alyx to raise more questions instead of answering them?
[3:00:31] <mike_wate> IM INVESTING 1K IN THE STOCK MARKET IF IT STABALIZES TOMORROW
[3:00:31] <+SpicyCheeseNips> I really don't much care for this part
[3:00:31] <CuttleCrow> HL1 you are just some guy, HL2 you are GORDON-JESUS
[3:00:31] <trickquestionz> Just refuse the G-Man and you get a definitive ending
[3:00:32] <%SolidusRex> HL1 is absolutely a cliffhanger
[3:00:36] <%Fidranth> MUSIC HOLY FUCK
[3:00:36] <dukenux> Silo D
[3:00:38] <%grandark_z317> I love this music
[3:00:38] <%crimsonharvest> the repeating flintlock
[3:00:41] <Melchior_the_Wise> I hate this section
[3:00:43] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> yarrr me boom hole
[3:00:43] <+SpicyCheeseNips> I never know where to go cuz I am dumb
[3:00:45] <SivSarcast> I'm ready for Alyx's Mind for sure.
[3:00:46] <%ssjklyco> Portal 2 was only one that didn't end in a cliffhanger
[3:00:46] <+TheSaintJohn> ugh this place
[3:00:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> @oruandrew Aperture and Black Mesa are rival companies, though Black Mesa massively outperforms them.
[3:00:50] <dukenux> dont remember this music in the og mod
[3:01:00] <mike_wate> PAT WITH BIG VOEWERS
[3:01:06] <pennykettle_> Fight me, you die at the end of Portal 2, ill defend this to the death
[3:01:07] <TurtleButter> nice track.
[3:01:08] <%StaceMcGate> Is Cave Johnson still alive at this time?
[3:01:08] <sambone_z> I miss Father Gregory
[3:01:11] <+AtlasMcCoy> @d00hicky2 Underhell is a good singleplayer source mod
[3:01:16] <+HouseofNonsense> Observe the blast pit with hasty
[3:01:16] <heartlesshealer> sniper
[3:01:17] <eckskyuucow> I thought this music was Sign of Evil for a sec
[3:01:17] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> ye
[3:01:19] <$Ziegsy> nioh 2 is amazing btw
[3:01:21] <dukenux> Black Mesa also *allegedly* stole Aperture's reseatch
[3:01:25] <+RioGascar> I do enjoy this music but i think kelly baileys score is really good
[3:01:26] <ScreamLord> Wouldn't be so bad if the last cliffhanger was permanent
[3:01:26] <SivSarcast> Lol since when could that thing fire a cluster sho?
[3:01:27] <%Pyroclase> this is pathetic
[3:01:27] <MassConnect> missing every shot
[3:01:30] <SivSarcast> *shot
[3:01:31] <CuttleCrow> you wish you could spit with that accuracy
[3:01:31] <KeystoneA1> You do have a zoom y'know
[3:01:32] <dashmatt> 0 dmg
[3:01:33] <TurtleButter> @AtlasMcCoy that project died, right?
[3:01:33] <dukenux> it's why Cave hates them so much
[3:01:33] <%StaceMcGate> FIRST TRY
[3:01:34] <%BayowolfTerra> Thats some RANGE
[3:01:34] <ScreamLord> *wasn't
[3:01:35] <%the_vedo_show> naisu
[3:01:35] <%crimsonharvest> i think there was a handrail ther
[3:01:36] <%YourFavoriteShiba> What about the Devil's Pit?
[3:01:37] <majima666> pat should go through the og deus ex one day
[3:01:37] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[3:01:39] <trickquestionz> I also never realized just how hard Portal is a great parody of Half-Life until I tries this release.
[3:01:42] <Khorneflakes_> Here comes the new tentacle monster cow noises.
[3:01:44] <mike_wate> How do you know where the bullets are going to go
[3:01:47] <theshillman> @majima666 agree
[3:01:51] <+AtlasMcCoy> @TurtleButter Ya Pretty sure it did. What's there is still fun tho
[3:01:56] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> SHOOT HIM
[3:01:57] <%StaceMcGate> What about the Woolie Hole?
[3:01:58] <CuttleCrow> kill
[3:01:58] <KeystoneA1> STAHP
[3:01:59] <heartlesshealer> throw body into string

[3:02:02] <heartlesshealer> or walk
[3:02:02] <natebud> Also If you run in a circle around vortigaunts they can't hurt you. (in the last build I played)
[3:02:03] <theKingRamses> BANG BANG
[3:02:03] <+derrigible> eww he coughed on you

[3:03:33] <%Ninestempest> @Melchior_the_Wise the guy literally tells you to be quiet??
[3:03:36] <SivSarcast> @Melchior_the_Wise I never knew that either.
[3:03:38] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> this was my first roadblock playing it back in the day
[3:03:41] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> why he clang?
[3:03:41] <+TheSaintJohn> LUL
[3:03:42] <Galacta_Pieta> mainly cause it looks like the tentacles have eyes
[3:03:43] <%StaceMcGate> LUL
[3:03:44] <Melchior_the_Wise> I didn't know what he meant, lol
[3:03:45] <trianglehat> nope LUL
[3:03:48] <$lotharrio> I like that it's trying to echo-locate by tapping surfaces.
[3:03:52] <+SpicyCheeseNips> If you look down in the whole you can see that the tentacle monster isn't connected to anything.
[3:03:57] <Grennold> Was it ever explained what this creature is?
[3:03:58] <%Ninestempest> i had the advantage playing this at liek 20 i guess
[3:03:59] <+SpicyCheeseNips> *hole DAMMIT
[3:04:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> @melchior_the_wise They already had secret portal experiments and were grabbing specimens from the other dimension. The Gman did some machinations and had them scan an especially anomalous sample that caused a massive uncontrolled portal event.
[3:04:14] <%CalderGaming> it teleported in from Xen like everything else
[3:04:19] <majima666> leave him alone, he's doing his best
[3:04:21] <natebud> it doesn't like you
[3:04:29] <Melchior_the_Wise> So they were using portals to capture aliens?
[3:04:30] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> 's a gud shottie
[3:04:35] <Grennold> SPAS-12 Kreygasm
[3:04:35] <chambatron> Like the shotguns from re6 right?
[3:04:35] <heartlesshealer> it's his first day
[3:04:36] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> It's the resident dungeon pet
[3:04:39] <%Ninestempest> was this in EA for a while or something? Cause I swore i've played a version of this before
[3:04:40] <CuttleCrow> they just don't make shotguns like they used to
[3:04:40] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> no
[3:04:43] <cpt_kaulp> Yo Pat just started playing monster hunter because of you. I LOVE IT!!!!!
[3:04:43] <+SpicyCheeseNips> eh
[3:04:44] <%BayowolfTerra> Great ragdoll physics
[3:04:46] <%the_vedo_show> yes :)
[3:04:47] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> meh\
[3:04:50] <dukenux> tbh i dont feel good for the thing. it was teleported from who knows what habitat, and is now stuck in a blast pit
[3:04:50] <%StaceMcGate> what an ineffective evolution, the squid monster is giant and scraps at any and all sound in a sedentary lifestyle
[3:04:51] <+SpicyCheeseNips> Almost walked into that
[3:04:52] <+derrigible> Otherwise known as Jelloading
[3:04:53] <DSD24> I like Air Hike
[3:04:57] <Revan175757> i like this shotgun more than Super shotgun from Doom
[3:04:59] <am_omega> No, the portal just showed up and shit just started flooding out.
[3:05:03] <natebud> I hate jumps, but I love loading
[3:05:05] <%DePhat1> gotta love shotguns and radgoll physics
[3:05:10] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[3:05:12] <%DePhat1> ragdoll*
[3:05:12] <heartlesshealer> just trace a perfect outline around the enemy
[3:05:12] <trickquestionz> Are the Jedi Outcast games just hard Half-Life rip offs?
[3:05:15] <KeystoneA1> MissedShotKing
[3:05:19] <Monkeyweed21> Any thoughts on Safi Jiiva so far?
[3:05:22] <majima666> nothing will ever beat the ultimate super shotgun of doom from the og re2
[3:05:23] <+SpicyCheeseNips> Might wanna start conserving your rifle ammo
[3:05:25] <TheAsianAvenger96> jump
[3:05:26] <+Hilleltaco> Won't know until you try Kappa

[3:05:26] <ShichiNoBushi> Do you know da wey?
[3:05:26] <%Pyroclase> there's water
[3:05:27] <terribleusername> do you know the way?
[3:05:37] <+RioGascar> Im hoping source 2 fixs the limited zones for levels that make loading happen often
[3:05:37] <sambone_z> also striders
[3:05:38] <%Pyroclase> there's a ladder??
[3:05:39] <%StaceMcGate> spooky noises
[3:05:41] <+SpicyCheeseNips> WATCH OUT
[3:05:48] <+RICE02> Pat confirmed no Mandalorina
[3:05:49] <jonnyworldbeater> So, is this a Half Life mod or did Valve release this.
[3:05:52] <Man_in_the_Red> @riogascar see how it is in Dota Kappa
[3:05:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> 1 hour until Nioh 2!
[3:06:00] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah acid hurts

[3:06:06] <%the_vedo_show> Damn get fucked
[3:06:07] <natebud> Right click shotgun is so good
[3:06:11] <$Ziegsy> its out now
[3:06:14] <DSD24> Im excited for Nioh 2
[3:06:15] <theshillman> is nioh 2 getting a PC release at all?
[3:06:18] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> its not midnnight
[3:06:19] <+SpicyCheeseNips> @Zaphire_Saucypants Think he meant the shotgun tbh
[3:06:20] <%Ninestempest> yes
[3:06:22] <ECRead> it's out yesterday
[3:06:22] <heartlesshealer> yeah, so download it tonight
[3:06:22] <%Ninestempest> eventually
[3:06:23] <jonnyworldbeater> I'd expect it to be a mod because Valve doesn't release anything anymore
[3:06:25] <Monkeyweed21> You play the new Iceborne update?
[3:06:32] <%StaceMcGate> poor Gamestop, no one is going to their stores on Mar 20 now LUL
[3:06:32] <theshillman> sad
[3:06:33] <karayou> tomorrow? yes, in an hour!
[3:06:35] <Khorneflakes_> cohhFeels PC release date
[3:06:36] <%wsintai> I cannot wait for mah Nioh 2 to unlock so I can make my waifu
[3:06:36] <majima666> i always get mixed up between nier and nioh...i need to play both of them
[3:06:38] <+DesertPenguin> Do you think you watching your Nioh 2 stream will give major spoilers?
[3:06:42] <+DesertPenguin> I don't care about plot
[3:06:44] <bashful_bard> Agreed
[3:06:46] <LysdexicAndVolingit> Did I just miss all of the nioh 2 adverts or did it's marketing budget just suck?
[3:06:49] <+RioGascar> @jonnyworldbeater They are literally releasing a game in 11 days
[3:06:49] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> kinda the same way
[3:06:51] <%FacetiousAF> makes sense to me
[3:06:53] <%saadi90> I am so excited! Staring at my PS4 dashboard
[3:06:53] <Coystick> Fake fan pat
[3:06:55] <Monkeyweed21> fake monster hunter fan
[3:06:55] <dashmatt> shotgun
[3:06:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> @jonnyworldbeater Fan-made, but officially endorsed by Valve.
[3:07:02] <Man_in_the_Red> @riogascar is it really Kappa
[3:07:02] <%xeros720> nioh 2 depended more on its open betas being streamed
[3:07:03] <Melchior_the_Wise> Horizon Zero Dawn, and Death Stranding PC master race
[3:07:05] <theshillman> did pat ever stream nioh or did the mind goblins stop him?
[3:07:09] <%valriot> Hopefully you'll actually play this Nioh game Kappa
[3:07:09] <TyrantSlime> Just give me content and let me do all events when I feel like it
[3:07:09] <+SpicyCheeseNips> How is nioh 2 compared to nioh 1? I never went past the first boss of that game.
[3:07:10] <keyworthe> honestly generations ultimate is the best mh game
[3:07:13] <Man_in_the_Red> i mean, if its VR does it even exist Kappa
[3:07:13] <natebud> Do they still give you the magnum in the offices in this build?
[3:07:14] <%xeros720> it got a bunch of good reviews though, but not like, commercials or such
[3:07:14] <Neo_Kaiser> Nioh 2 came out 14 hours ago
[3:07:16] <%bread_assassin> So are ya going to double dip @PatStaresAt
[3:07:16] <+RioGascar> yes it is really
[3:07:17] <%ssjklyco> He'll be crippled by menu items to get any progress done
[3:07:18] <dukenux> thats a big fan
[3:07:21] <LixFury> Who gives a shit about Nioh story
[3:07:22] <thebushmanisback> I didnt realize neoh got a sequal
[3:07:23] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt did you ever finish Nioh?
[3:07:24] <+DesertPenguin> Pat is to Nioh as Paige is to Dark Souls?
[3:07:26] <%StaceMcGate> nice aim
[3:07:27] <%YakumoYomi> @theshillman Apparently, Gamespot is saying that it's getting a PC release in November. I can't find a source, though.
[3:07:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> You missed every shot

[3:07:49] <natebud> @KeystoneA1 awesome
[3:07:51] <%wsintai> @DesertPenguin That's not fair to Paige, Pat cries a lot more
[3:07:55] <+schlager087> Doom eternal or R3make?
[3:08:04] <Futurecity10> eternal
[3:08:05] <+RICE02> its about Nobunaga sama
[3:08:06] <Cpl_Elemena> you miss all the shots you take ... wait a minute ...
[3:08:07] <%StaceMcGate> that's death Pat
[3:08:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> @neo_kaiser Depends on if it's a digital purchase, and where you live. I'm staring at a timer right now.

[3:08:11] <Man_in_the_Red> @schlager087 REmake is at least replayable
[3:08:12] <+SpicyCheeseNips> go go go
[3:08:12] <wrydiculous> nioh 2 takes place when nobunaga is alive
[3:08:13] <%bread_assassin> I saw someone stream earlier today and it convinced me to give Nioh 1 another go.
[3:08:14] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> careful Pat
[3:08:15] <+SpicyCheeseNips> MOVE
[3:08:15] <heartlesshealer> it's just that paige also cries when she laughs because the hurty laughs
[3:08:17] <natebud> @KeystoneA1 I might have to replay this
[3:08:18] <Coystick> Of the four big games coming out FF7 and Nioh2 gotta get the cutt for me.
[3:08:22] <%tactician0> I ran through nioh 1 no problem on my first play through
