[0:00:13] <Cerabret100> wait void outs are actually a thing? how exactly do people get caught by bts?
[0:00:33] <Aristotlay> Grabbo > Dieo> Boomo
[0:00:37] <%Ner234> SourPls
[0:00:39] <Dexys94> Huh, I guess in-universe that can be a bad deal every time it happens, but I expected it to have more gameplay ramifications, if that's true.
[0:00:48] <+CrazyRainbows> Don't escape the hands or die fighting them = Voidout
[0:00:59] <Aristotlay> 1 voidout = 1 prayer
[0:00:59] <deviljhojho_> early stream tonite
[0:01:07] <Mendin> If you don't struggle out of the ghoulies grabbing you, you get taken for a ride and have to basically fight the Port Knot miniboss
[0:01:12] <Cerabret100> Like i'm in chapter 7 and theyve never even seen me
[0:01:13] <~AngriestPat> jho its the same time literally every night
[0:01:23] <deviljhojho_> damn i got exposed
[0:01:31] <+CrazyRainbows> But if you fight the miniboss you get big chiral reward
[0:01:34] <HyperBomb21> ayyy
[0:01:39] <Mendin> @AngriestPat has Peach recovered from her weird anime meltdown this afternoon?

[0:02:17] <HyperBomb21> Freindly reminder to have woolie's stream open in a tab. Even if you arent watching it actively, it still contributes a view

[0:03:26] <shadytreeofknowledge> Sup Elmo
[0:03:28] <+bigbro_18> who is ready for more of the adventures Amazon Prime Man?

[0:03:31] <KanukMunch> bonjour my friends!
[0:03:31] <ptmpopulatethemoon> i'm legitimately excited for this, i just got a new job so i cant afford death stranding at the moment and I love watching pat play.
[0:03:36] <HyperBomb21> It's deinfately longer than 40
[0:03:36] <Lurantis_> Thats pretty solid @goombella
[0:03:37] <mchunted> 40 hours i think
[0:03:38] <deviljhojho_> I imagine you can't get a void out near cities crikObject
[0:03:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> it's not death stranding. its norman reedus and the funky fetus.
[0:03:41] <HyperBomb21> I'm 40 hours in and sitllin episode 3
[0:03:42] <%StaceMcGate> StaceMcGate subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Pat, if you were Norman Reedus, how long would you deliver packages before rage quitting and tossing the supplies off a cliff?
[0:03:42] <deviljhojho_> that would fuck you up
[0:03:43] <sqointus> Awaken awaken! Take the land that must be taken!
[0:03:48] <+CrazyRainbows> I finished at about 43hrs I think? I didn't do a lot of the side-orders though
[0:03:49] <Cerabret100> @HyperBomb21 Having faceplanted in to a ravine that is very true, i think its because i'm way too careful, instant crouch and slow walk entire bt field
[0:03:49] <raco4000> pat is cool
[0:03:50] <Lunarmight> I really do hope this starts where the last stream ended

[0:10:20] <Lunarmight> redbull is way better.
[0:10:20] <Aristotlay> @AngriestPat do you have any feelings about the fact that every menu in Death Stranding is placed at a weird skewed perspective? Its not as stylish as P5, but its an aesthetic choice nonetheless. TBH it kinda bugs me, but it probably does make the UI feel more in-world.
[0:10:21] <%g_rimbo> Burn the mouse before it goes necro
[0:10:21] <+Darren716> Welp Paige isnt getting the monster money

[0:12:26] <Aristotlay> @AngriestPat do you have any feelings about the fact that every menu in Death Stranding is placed at a weird skewed perspective? Its not as stylish as P5, but its an aesthetic choice nonetheless. TBH it kinda bugs me, but it probably does make the UI feel more immersive?

[0:28:42] <Soul_Intern> PAT WHY DID YOU DIE?
[0:28:43] <%rytisone> Pat blew it
[0:28:44] <%cureneckbeard> woolie should have been the chosen one
[0:28:44] <deviljhojho_> that was known tho
[0:28:44] <Mendin> big cumbo
[0:28:44] <+Darren716> Why is Woolie screaming about ISIS?
[0:28:46] <%XeroSigmaPrime> ITS LITERALLY IN THE PROLOGUE
[0:28:48] <bakkatohri> The voidout thing isn't really a spoiler, because it's something that people have been predicting since before the game came out.
[0:28:48] <%g_rimbo> OOPSIE WOOPSIE WE MADE A FUCKY WUCKY
[0:28:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so this is news to me
[0:28:52] <%Laecerelius> I assumed that was going to be a thing the moment I saw it happen in the story
[0:28:52] <Nina96> i never heard about it til u said it Pat
[0:28:57] <%Run44forrest> @AngriestPat YOU CAN CAUSE VOID OUT AND THEY STAY? PogChamp
[0:28:59] <%medusasghost> to be on the internet is to be spoiled though so it's whatever at this point
[0:28:59] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat what can you void out t the entire map
[0:29:01] <%XeroSigmaPrime> you learn about void outs 5 min dep
[0:29:01] <%legendscar01> @angriestpat did you see the new Sonic design
[0:29:02] <%psychodave1234> paige was backseat driving
[0:29:03] <Cerabret100> I kinda want to purposely cause a void out just to see what its like
[0:29:04] <FirearmsInstructor> @g_rimbo D:
[0:29:04] <gsoto83> wow
[0:29:07] <ha2ken> Watch Woolie...or watch Pat...decisions decisions decisions...
[0:29:09] <PrimeNeverproc> can you clear all hills?
[0:29:09] <%xtremegamer80> And now Woolie's talking about abuse
[0:29:10] <gsoto83> EVEN PEACH REMEMBERED THAT
[0:29:10] <Guardiansaiyan> @Run44forrest yes
[0:29:11] <%FrostMass22> It's in the prologue but it was a story thing
[0:29:12] <Demon_chann> kojima literally said DS dosent have true game overs (which it does have)
[0:29:13] <%This_is_Marco> @MrBorisMakarov YOOOO Thank you for the sub <3

[0:29:23] <Soul_Intern> @xtremegamer80 That sounds fun
[0:29:25] <%acktuallyron> It happening in a story beat doesn't really imply it will happen in non-canonic player deaths
[0:29:27] <%CrabSlacks> please tell me you guys never ride in the same car together
[0:29:27] <Simicrisps> Not only is it in the prologue, but Deadman says if you die it'll still cause a voidout.

[0:54:08] <bakkatohri> What if Jared Leto had his own cult that delivered dog jizz to other actors.
[0:54:08] <%g_rimbo> That was an angry box throw
[0:54:09] <FrankysDream> @AngriestPat use the rope
[0:54:13] <%joylent_blue> ?????????

[0:54:16] <+wholehole> Shoulderbarge, punch punch punch best combo
[0:54:16] <maverickdrifter> Gotta use Delivery CQC
[0:54:17] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat shove your turgid piss grenades into their mouths
[0:54:19] <MoulesFritz> @AngriestPat they won't stop coimg just go

[0:54:32] <sniffy77> use the piss!
[0:54:33] <%aeravon> wow. So this is the first time you ever played
[0:54:35] <+wholehole> Or just wang one of their cases at them
[0:54:35] <%dabeaminator> Pat this isn't Assassin's Creed, stop trying to fight.
[0:54:36] <blaggablag> USE YOUR BONDAGE ROPE YOU COWARD
[0:54:41] <%AncelDeLambert> quick, drink your own piss!
[0:54:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> have you tried picking up one of their packages and hitting them with it?
[0:54:42] <Cherokia666> So Pat never learned how to actually fight.
[0:54:43] <CaptCatastrophe> RIP fragile package
[0:54:45] <TheSkeletonLords> Mail men fighting like that scene in anchorman but instead of news stations it’s postal companies
[0:54:46] <%honeyman18> Hit THEM WITH THEIR CRAP
[0:54:47] <%wookie5358> It sure is convenient that they only come 2 at a time and politely wait for their friends to die
[0:54:47] <zafooru> they're evil mailment, not evil warriors
[0:54:51] <%LaughingCatt> Is stuff ok?
[0:54:52] <%This_is_Marco> pee on them to assert dominance
[0:54:52] <gsoto83> And then some
[0:54:53] <+Grizzytron> porter hunters are farming pat for part breaks
[0:54:53] <%PaladinDupre> NUKES
[0:54:57] <KasiCrafter> Can you use their cases to hit them? Since they're not mission critical?
[0:54:58] <%SWFanatic> Monster Energy > MULE Energy
[0:55:00] <%honeyman18> One hit kills with case in hand
[0:55:01] <%CrabSlacks> use the stuff as weapons
[0:55:01] <jacknerik> drop off the materials at the bridge
[0:55:01] <Ausk> where was his voidout
[0:55:01] <wannabemoogle> Pee on them for dominance
[0:55:01] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Now eat them
[0:55:02] <%marsanta> Go rebuild the road!
[0:55:04] <katocrimson> donate those metals to the road
[0:55:04] <deviljhojho_> lookin fat n sassy
[0:55:05] <%Run44forrest> PEE ON THEM
[0:55:06] <MoulesFritz> all your fragile cargo is shards now
[0:55:06] <morningmoondude> didn't dodge offset FFS
[0:55:07] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat you should have thrown cum at them
[0:55:07] <blaggablag> Just spray that shit up it buffs right off
[0:55:08] <%thenumber5point5> and now you have supplys for the road
[0:55:10] <%joylent_blue> @AngriestPat using the rope gives you a parry that's super easy cuz it has slowdown
[0:55:10] <%realm_forge> I DONT KNOW YOU THATS MY PURSE
[0:55:12] <%AncelDeLambert> it's weird to live in a world where bandits CAN'T kill the people they rob, because it would summon nuke ghosts
[0:55:13] <%ArcanumMBD> so there's a couple ways to do combat. You can mash like you just did, use the strand to parry, or bash their heads in with cargo
[0:55:15] <+BlockingDisabled> Break their hands!
[0:55:15] <%Ner234> Wasn't that cargo fragle? Check if it's ok.
[0:55:21] <%Gruhunchously> This is getting weirdly Mad Max, just more temperate in climate
[0:55:22] <HyperBomb21> @AngriestPat you can bet them up with cargo by holding something in your hand while attacking
[0:55:25] <cosmicgoatee> pee on em LUL
[0:55:27] <Soul_Intern> CUM ON THEM
[0:55:31] <+wjones0415> you know port-fu
[0:55:32] <%AncelDeLambert> MY GOD
[0:55:33] <%valriot> @angriestpat Holding L2 and R2, then using X will dodge, using Square will shoulder charge them
[0:55:34] <%Ner234> RIP
[0:55:35] <+kungfauxboi> Oh there's combat in this game? All I ever seen is WALKING
[0:55:35] <%realm_forge> PISS ON THEM FOR DOMINANCE
[0:55:36] <%rytisone> Pat has cum to

[0:55:54] <42nfl19> PISS ON THEM FOR DOMINANCE
[0:55:56] <%SWFanatic> Mules S Ranked My Mom

[0:56:05] <@lewdskeletor13> Can’t S rank the cum anymore

[0:56:22] <cosmicgoatee> F rank for Fanny

[1:17:50] <superd4v3> @AngriestPat What can the smoke emitting decoy be used for?
[1:17:52] <%Ausk> you do have a vertical limit to your cargo even if you're under your weight limit
[1:17:52] <TheDr0t> you can actually kill in this game but you'll need to carry the body to burn it
[1:17:53] <%joylent_blue> but the Frogs were a different enemy type

[1:35:33] <%Nyanlathotep> I think it's less that the game isn't actually stream poison and more that Pat is the kind of person who can actually present something like this in an entertaining way.

[1:36:22] <%debugdrawray_> @AngriestPat as you add more people to the network youll start to see other peoples contributions to the road, it goes so fuckin far
[1:36:23] <Big_King_Coconut> isn't the timefall gonna erode that in like four days?
[1:36:23] <%TheStarvingGood> yep

[1:36:35] <agumon9000> uuuuh
[1:36:36] <%JustToWatch> it's super worth it to build the roads though
[1:36:36] <nesterov81> Roads are nice, but call me when we can build RAILroads.
[1:36:37] <%valriot> @angriestpat Roads are also online btw, so it's a shared contribution
[1:36:37] <%starlitalpha> you can put a sign requesting help building roads
[1:36:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> gotta go fast
[1:36:37] <%rytisone> pay construction mafia
[1:36:39] <+MurlinDurl> if you stay in the middle you can use battery infinitly

[1:37:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> Roads were what let the romans control a shit ton of land
[1:37:09] <%derap41> Make sure you're online if you want to have a chance at using the roads
[1:37:11] <%SWFanatic> Push some rope
[1:37:11] <Monkeyweed21> you have spares
[1:37:11] <%joylent_blue> just need a bike now
[1:37:12] <%rytisone> boots go down, roads go up
[1:37:16] <astroPunkFunk> new boot goofin
[1:37:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> if you wait for the chiral network to be up in each section with road stuff, the other players materials used will lessen the amount you need to put in.
[1:37:19] <heartlesshealer> Pat got the leggies for destroying his spine with massive loads
[1:37:20] <superd4v3> @herfaintsmile And Norman's totally cool with it LUL
[1:37:25] <ThDark> The road is a "takes some time" sort of thing, don't expect to be doing it quickly

[1:48:30] <+Evergreen_45> i think people are scared of a "walking simulator" because to them the walking part has always been the tedious part in getting to the "fun part". But when the focus of the game is the walking part, it suprisingly works and is fun
[1:48:31] <%floralkami> who you gonna convin?
[1:48:31] <Soul_Intern> Wasps are worst

[1:49:27] <HoIlywood_SN> @Evergreen_45 the term "walking simulator" also usually refers to games that have bog standard modern FPS movement with literally nothing else but walking around enclosed linear environments in a normal FPS kind of way, but thats literally all you do, move and look at things, but this is entirely different from that
[1:49:28] <Thorn14> Pat you're looking at your shoe meter not battery

[2:10:09] <dekkitout> Slap on dem timbs, b
[2:10:11] <%mechslayer71> Is this seriously the game?
[2:10:11] <%nofestu2> FEET AR RISK
[2:10:11] <Monkeyweed21> make some new boots here
[2:10:11] <%psychodave1234> FOOT AT RISK
[2:10:12] <Koosahmii> Is that blood?
[2:10:12] <KasiCrafter> 50% of two is one.
[2:10:13] <%sporeian94> no only barefoot
[2:10:16] <+Trancefearence> %50 means half the boot is gone
[2:10:17] <heartlesshealer> Yeah Pat, the upper 50% of your boots
[2:10:18] <rumuloh> 50% of a pair of shoes is one shoe
[2:10:18] <TheDr0t> guess not
[2:10:21] <mrhooppaw> you start having more trouble balancing at 50
[2:10:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> its icky
[2:10:29] <+Ell1ot> if i had half of my shoe left, I'd consider it busted
[2:10:32] <%psychodave1234> time to make the degenerates happy and go barefoot
[2:10:32] <+SkaiVibration> "That day Sam lost a foot"
[2:10:32] <%derap41> unless you're actually loosing blood its fine
[2:10:33] <%sporeian94> you can just do it all at the same time with deliver cargo
[2:10:33] <$FluffiTamamo> Pour some Monster Energy on your foot, that’ll fix it right up.
[2:10:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I got one fine with 50%
[2:10:34] <agumon9000> Your left shoe is no more
[2:10:40] <LotS__> If your real-life boots were at 50%, they'd be pretty fucked
[2:10:40] <Patchworq> Nobody talks in person. Back in my day we talked in person not hologram
[2:10:42] <%crazypieman7> @AngriestPat If you deliver requested cargo it includes the lost cargo so you don't have to watch the animation twice
[2:10:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> on*

[2:22:52] <agumon9000> Bridges are expensive
[2:22:54] <Cerabret100> @AngriestPat dimantling only gets rid of it for you
[2:22:54] <NeroInfinite> because ropes are cheap
[2:22:54] <Baeltyr> because people are poor Pat
[2:22:54] <@commanderclaw> They're pushing rope to save america
[2:22:55] <@lewdskeletor13> Peach Porter Saliva
[2:22:56] <Floorislava> they degrade
[2:22:56] <tigerfang86> expensive
[2:22:57] <Monkeyweed21> highways are better
[2:22:58] <%supersugoisenpai1> You need mats
[2:22:58] <%Maids4lyfe> no one has materials
[2:22:58] <%derap41> Cause bridges cost resources and people build roads
[2:22:58] <Fujiwara_92> it's expensive
[2:22:58] <Bigyin396> Cos bridges are expensive and it's the middle of nowhere
[2:22:59] <%ShichiNoBushi> Nobody wants to lugg out the resources.
[2:22:59] <Patchworq> What's a bridge?
[2:22:59] <Lunarmight> they're cheap assholes
[2:23:00] <%aishman> Expensive as fuck
[2:23:01] <wannabemoogle> They wanna save resources
[2:23:01] <SpaceGuntank> bridge need tons of metal
[2:23:02] <%debugdrawray_> you might not have one on your shard
[2:23:03] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat you're bullying that mans rope
[2:23:03] <%topendbuzz> MF be lazy
[2:23:04] <dekkitout> Bridge v Rope War or nah?
[2:23:04] <TheDr0t> @AngriestPat cox you need material
[2:23:04] <heartlesshealer> bridges get eaten by the time rain
[2:23:05] <MattsKitchen67> that's the theme of the game
[2:23:05] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Why go down and up when you can go across
[2:23:05] <%Doomcoder> Sam Porter Ropes
[2:23:05] <%MrCalieb> You gotta cross the bridge to get to the chorus
[2:23:08] <southstarshen> roads better
[2:23:12] <+yarob01> materials
[2:23:12] <sponsoredviewer910> because they are peasants
[2:23:14] <+SleazyShell> Bridges spensive
[2:23:15] <Hellarussian> can you use the BB as a grappling hook?
[2:23:16] <jon651> All those ropes just became obsolete
[2:23:17] <Taffer85> it took me like 20 hours to figure out how to register upgrade
[2:23:18] <%Maids4lyfe> how the fuck do you request an upgrade
[2:23:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> because people are diptorks
[2:23:19] <%GarbageNirvana> Get everyone to do the work for you, that's the Pat way

[2:26:28] <grimrjak> spiderman clap
[2:26:28] <ScreamLord> I actually don't like it when games have a lot of characters based on celebrities. It makes development way more expensive than it needs to be and it limits it's post launch potential. One of the main reasons Onimusha 2-3 hasn't been remastered is because some of the main characters are based on real actors. Onimusha 3 is my favorite in the series and I might not see a re-release because Jean Reno said no

[2:27:08] <%sporeian94> Well Paige isn't painting her boobs on stream for thristy neckbeards
[2:27:10] <ScreamLord> I actually don't like it when games have a lot of characters based on celebrities. It makes development way more expensive than it needs to be and it limits it's post launch potential. One of the main reasons Onimusha 2-3 hasn't been remastered is because some of the main characters are based on real actors. Onimusha 3 is my favorite in the series and I might not see a re-release because Jean Reno said no (Posted twice because Chat exploded)

[2:40:01] <%xtremegamer80> Is it raining blood??
[2:40:06] <%Nyanlathotep> @AncelDeLambert Norman's bodily fluids are toxic to ghosts because he can't die.
[2:40:11] <%Run44forrest> blood grenades
[2:40:11] <%AncelDeLambert> Boy, Fallout 3 is lots of fun, isn't this stream of Fallout 3 great?

[2:40:25] <ExpressNode> That's not blood its cyborg juice
[2:40:29] <PirateMike_> Looks like the place from the trailor
[2:40:31] <%Doomcoder> or, possibly, he can't die because his body is toxic to the afterlife
[2:40:31] <%Thenuclearwalrus> @TigerClaws12 Blood Grenades
[2:40:32] <%derap41> @TigerClaws12 these are blood nades
[2:40:37] <TigerClaws12> ah

[2:40:46] <$bobbyganoush> cheer500 Hey Pat! Long, long, long time watcher all the way when I saw the first video you guys did posted on a stupid video game meme website called ***. Have you played FF 11 at all? How do your online buds in 14 feel about how they retroactively crammed in a way to play it by yourself if you wanted to? Best wishes and give my howdy do to the Mustard Queen as well!
[2:40:48] <+OperatorPlease> they made you bleed your own blood!
[2:40:49] <$FluffiTamamo> Ah good. The blood bases just seemed a better option to me.
[2:40:53] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat BT juice. Don't breathe this!!
[2:40:53] <%Gruhunchously> The Division 3 looks pretty good, not gonna lie.

[2:41:24] <+keyoray> I hate this. THe screams are the worse ASMR.

[2:41:27] <Fro5tburn> Kreygasm
[2:41:27] <MattDemers> Haven't watched anything Death Stranding so far; what's the in-universe explanation for the arm/pulsing thing Sam's wearing?

[2:41:33] <Fujiwara_92> PING
[2:41:33] <Cherokia666> On Hard it sometimes takes 2 grenades to take out a BT... that was some shit
[2:41:34] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, cause it's Chicago
[2:41:36] <Spectatorlo_ol> Why does it suck?
[2:41:37] <$DarkKnightGrave> BITCH NIGGA GHOSTS
[2:41:39] <%oktavia_von> cleary not a boss battle
[2:41:43] <+yarob01> no need to kill all of them

[2:41:56] <%supercasualboom> supercasualboom subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 18 month streak!

[2:41:58] <Cerabret100> @Cherokia666 actually i'm on hard so maybe its that and not that they get harder as game moves on
[2:42:02] <deviljhojho_> kinda rude tbh
[2:42:05] <%Doomcoder> can't tell if hard mode would be a more interesting challenge or just more tedious
[2:42:06] <%starlitalpha> kill them anyway for crystals
[2:42:07] <aeonicvector> Turns out those native americans broke a TON of mirrors, tripple cursed

[2:42:10] <%nofestu2> Kill them all Pat
[2:42:10] <Frozenflame01> Hey Pat I heard that if you allow the BT to capture you and you face the monster they all disappear when defeated the monster
[2:42:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> behind it
[2:42:11] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> That's the same sound from when that guy revives in Re:Zero.

[2:42:15] <+Onlysamfisher > does BT stand for Bad Thing? lol what does BT stand for?
[2:42:17] <pipboy344> @fluffitamamo Best tactic I’ve found for BIG SQUID is blood grenades and Handgun upgraded with anti-bt rounds that are boosted in effectiveness when they are covered by grenade cloud
[2:42:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> started a boss fight
[2:42:20] <TheDr0t> @AngriestPat behind the thing
[2:42:21] <%Nyanlathotep> You can't murder a ghost
[2:42:22] <zafooru> Beached Thing

[2:58:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> test dat new gun, Pat

[2:58:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Gee whiz, I thought there weren't Codecs in this Pat spyCappa
[2:58:59] <mayorrev> There was also the MGS GAME OVER text
[2:59:02] <CALLthaDoctah> does this game have an awesome vocal theme
[2:59:04] <Ragnakawaii> Why don't they just use drones?
[2:59:06] <%Doomcoder> as one does with toasters
[2:59:08] <+yarob01> Raid the mules camp
[2:59:09] <Guardiansaiyan> @Bigyin396 my brain is breaking
[2:59:10] <hntronium> chiral clouds
[2:59:13] <+jeapes13> @xtremegamer80 yes
[2:59:14] <%xtremegamer80> @Bigyin396 "Where the fuck am I?"
[2:59:17] <$vincerocmm> fight
[2:59:17] <+bigboyeggo> sounds like a pretty neat toaster to me
[2:59:18] <NotHereToStream> bola gun time
[2:59:20] <nobody12349> Diehardman has BIG "totally gonna betray you in a big story moment" energy but I hope I'm wrong.
[2:59:21] <%cureneckbeard> why does die hardman have a mask? is he just an edgelord
[2:59:22] <42nfl19> thank goodness YOU HAVE A GUN
[2:59:23] <VERDAXY> SAVE THE TOASTER
[2:59:24] <%superc37> @callthadoctah depends on whether or not you like low roar
[2:59:24] <+luketrapwalker> Just infiltrate and steal 4Head
[2:59:25] <ItsAGundamu> Damn he pissed
[2:59:27] <hntronium> @Ragnakawaii Chiral stuff in the air stops drones and planes
[2:59:27] <+yarob01> use the bola gun
[2:59:28] <+jcenderion> why cuffs tho
[2:59:30] <%xtremegamer80> @jeapes13 This is where we steal MULE trucks?
[2:59:30] <Guardiansaiyan> @Ragnakawaii drones die and desintergrate in timefall
[2:59:36] <%derap41> @Ragnakawaii there's like a 3 page essay on why the stopped using drones
[2:59:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> protecc toaster
[2:59:37] <CALLthaDoctah> is it sins of the father tier?
[2:59:41] <Ragnakawaii> Ah thank you
[2:59:44] <%demegodz> @AngriestPat Bola Gun time
[2:59:48] <%honeyman18> The atmosphere is full of time accelerant, so drones would disintegrate in like minutes.
[2:59:50] <%Omegaanimus> also Mules would get the drones, a Porter can fight back
[2:59:53] <agumon9000> left
[2:59:56] <cosmicgoatee> You know what dey say...All Toasters...toast toast
[2:59:56] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat West. Green diamond
[3:00:00] <Guardiansaiyan> @derap41 no pictures in the essay...3/10
[3:00:00] <%TDAWS_MP132> almost
[3:00:01] <nesterov81> @Ragnakawaii They tried using drones and AIs to automate everything, but people just went crazy in their bunkers with nothing to do.
[3:00:02] <%Omegaanimus> and Porters can carry more
[3:00:05] <+Godjaw> recycle the materials
[3:00:06] <mrbobuncle> you might want to drop some of that shit off
[3:00:07] <agumon9000> 800 metal
[3:00:08] <%cureneckbeard> why don't they just coat the drones in whatever Sam's clothes are made out of
[3:00:10] <hntronium> Pat, you're not getting the rest of the stuff from the bt crater?
[3:00:12] <%Omegaanimus> the point is the human contact
[3:00:19] <@lewdskeletor13> Also if they used drones there would be no gameplay
[3:00:20] <%Omegaanimus> it's not about the deliveries
[3:00:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you can't stealth if you're cargo is too tall, Pat.
[3:00:24] <agumon9000> Do that one first
[3:00:29] <agumon9000> it only needs like 200 metal
[3:00:29] <Shastafield> LUL no one helped
[3:00:32] <NodFlender> Is this arthouse Smokey and the Bandit?
[3:00:33] <%Doomcoder> MULEs are motivated by the power of friendship
[3:00:35] <+lagmar99> If a road is build, anything in the path poofs
[3:00:38] <%xtremegamer80> @lewdskeletor13 Funny you should mention that
[3:00:39] <%Omegaanimus> there's a part in Interviews that explains why they don't use drones
[3:00:44] <%cureneckbeard> Humans have hands. Hands means chiral. Chiral means nobody gets left behind
[3:00:44] <Leroytirebiter> who needs stealth when you can just fuckin book it
[3:00:52] <Guardiansaiyan> @lewdskeletor13 the drones could be viachiles...or horizon zero dawn 2
[3:00:54] <Jathspuh> The Death Strandings we met along the way atpSuspect
[3:00:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Chiral means Extreme
[3:01:00] <toasty_salads> this is what happened on forrest gumps walk across America
[3:01:11] <%derap41> Who needs stealth when you have gun
[3:01:12] <%demegodz> Yeaaah
[3:01:12] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Get 200 metal on the side for the other persons bridge
[3:01:16] <Guardiansaiyan> @cureneckbeard hawaii sure is fucked in this universe
[3:01:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> no stealth for Pat
[3:01:17] <%ShichiNoBushi> Lots of materials in that MULE camp.
[3:01:20] <%Nobrev> Kiwami means chiral
[3:01:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Valentinius_Anodyne Bridges kun!~

[3:03:31] <ShmowzowKapow> the highways are so nice
[3:03:32] <Fujiwara_92> just a little bit
[3:03:35] <Cherokia666> Highways and roads can still be damaged by Timefall, so hope it stays up
[3:03:40] <%derap41> in the game

[3:04:27] <bashful_bard> It's a chiralium dense road I guess
[3:04:29] <+Imn0tacop> is anyone NOT early in this game right now?
[3:04:34] <%Thenuclearwalrus> That road looks FUCKIN EVIL

[3:27:59] <zafooru> Ghostmerica
[3:28:00] <%cureneckbeard> Why did nobody think to build this before
[3:28:00] <aeonicvector> Streamer connects america one piss and magic at a time

[3:28:07] <%Thenuclearwalrus> KKona
[3:28:09] <%dabeaminator> Is the highway floating?
[3:28:13] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat People are big screaming at you to drink MONSTER LUL
[3:28:15] <%AncelDeLambert> boy, sure do love that bridge you were building, Pat, nice bridge
[3:28:18] <agumon9000> @AngriestPat Now you can walk along that road all the way to the city
[3:28:19] <Lunarmight> go rest first!
[3:28:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> not made with real tarmac OR cheese.
[3:28:20] <%starlitalpha> look UNDER the highway
[3:28:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeyeye pats doing it!
[3:28:21] <Jathspuh> @cureneckbeard no wifi yet
[3:28:23] <%honeyman18> Big Ride or Die Time
[3:28:23] <ZaDoorman> do roads last forever or does the rain damage it?
[3:28:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> What if one of the ghosts was just Highway Star?
[3:28:29] <%sporeian94> to the left pat
[3:28:30] <%AncelDeLambert> How's that BRIDGE working out, Pat?
[3:28:30] <Lunarmight> stop and rest why dont ya?
[3:28:32] <bashful_bard> The roads are beautiful until people start parking their vehicles in the middle
[3:28:34] <tmix1600> Highway of america, like wall of china but less environment friendly
[3:28:35] <%Thenuclearwalrus> Rain damages it over time
[3:28:36] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> has they created high ways that skip over the entire game yet?
[3:28:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> durability is high on em, but yeah.
[3:28:39] <$HyperionXV> The rain damages it, but you or other players can repair i
[3:28:40] <%sporeian94> it's by the signs
[3:28:47] <VERDAXY> Can you buy any plastic tents or tarps?
[3:28:50] <zenith0111> Is Pat on Chapter 3?
[3:28:51] <%DedlokPM> @ZaDoorman rain does damage it, but people can put in resources to repair it
[3:28:53] <+Caped_Eggy> America's infrastructures are failing and kojima and pat are rebuilding them LUL
[3:28:57] <NeroInfinite> It said the rain does damage to the roads os everyoneneeds to contribiute to the up keep
[3:29:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @zenith0111 yes.
[3:29:03] <agumon9000> Follow the road back to the city so you can sleep and stock up
[3:29:05] <%sporeian94> left
[3:29:06] <%supersugoisenpai1> You should head back to port knot city for an upgrade
[3:29:06] <%cureneckbeard> why don't they just build the roads in underground tunnels and everyone can live underground
[3:29:08] <Fujiwara_92> let pat play with his bridge guys, stop being mean
[3:29:10] <+FattimusSlime> Is Pat wearing an apron?
[3:29:10] <Zinax7> where are the backbone of america the stripclubs?
[3:29:11] <+D00msDayDan> are players choosing the paths for the roads or are they preset?
[3:29:14] <%honeyman18> C'mon ride that Road man
[3:29:16] <Monkeyweed21> PAT NO
[3:29:19] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> Every week is infrastructure week under president Pat
[3:29:21] <Bigbossman91> preset
[3:29:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> Preset roads
[3:29:23] <old_dog_god> When will they make the Yuru Camp mod for Death Stranding
[3:29:25] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat don't you have a bike?
[3:29:25] <bashful_bard> Those roads last a while. Repair is super cheap too
[3:29:27] <%cureneckbeard> solar roadways

[3:29:39] <@commanderclaw> Haul your robo skeleton ass
[3:29:39] <+AnHero64> You should consider drinking monster tm

[3:29:52] <%Keyd00d> YES
[3:29:53] <Bigyin396> CAN YOU NOT MAKE BIKES YET!?

[3:30:01] <mayorrev> i think he can make bikes
[3:30:02] <CALLthaDoctah> it doesn't drain stamina to run on the highway?
[3:30:02] <Bigbossman91> @AngriestPat you get the bike in the city
[3:30:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> should be soonish

[3:30:38] <%DjFrostBite95> hahaha
[3:30:40] <ZaDoorman> interesting, so this whole game is like a single player online community type thing. I'm interested but i think I'll wait for a sale; $80 CAD seems a little to much for me.

[3:41:20] <%sporeian94> Also I'm going to be the bearer of bad news here. Killing Mules doesn't cause a void out. Apparently if you kill them the area just becomes BT ridden for a while and then goes back to nromal

[3:43:06] <mostundesired> Trucks have batteries.
[3:43:07] <%derap41> So long as you're inside the network you can build a generator
[3:43:08] <%PinkSuprende> Pat the truck can only hold 7 XL containers, or the equivolent in smaller containers
[3:43:09] <+yarob01> not on the highway
[3:43:09] <%LaughingCatt> Gotta get it to the road I guess

[3:54:19] <Dutchpotato> Literally why not use the truck though
[3:54:19] <+Reizie_Etherealm> BIG CHUNGUS
[3:54:22] <+RealPT1> does the game SUBTLY explain all the nursery tunes in all the menus jingles?
[3:54:22] <%cureneckbeard> daytime is an illusion like in anor londo
[3:54:22] <mrbobuncle> USE TRUCK
[3:54:23] <+twohitgood> why no truck??
[3:54:28] <PrimeNeverproc> pats big shit is falling down, falling down, falling down. pts big shit is falling down my fair trucky

[3:54:30] <mrbobuncle> WTF PAT
[3:54:33] <%rytisone> I want people to cosplay this and not fit through the convention doors
[3:54:34] <mrbobuncle> NO
[3:54:35] <purple_bagel> Sometimes walking is nice
[3:54:35] <captain_thickthighs> dude why not just load the truck up first with everything then go over to it
[3:54:41] <%aishman> @AngriestPat Pat, don't forget to drink your digital monster to heal stamina
[3:54:44] <+Ell1ot> wouldn't it be easier to carry a shipping container at this point?
[3:54:45] <JDebss> This is me walking around in fallout or scrolls
[3:54:49] <DatHatBoy> the camp?
[3:54:50] <%wookie5358> You're not playing the deliberately slow game fast enough!
[3:54:52] <thehashslingingslashers> @AngriestPat Do you think the Death Stranding is the reason there isn't a night time?
[3:54:55] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat you can bump the truck to the side of the round platform. Don't need to drive it up the steps. THink of it like a loading dock.
[3:55:00] <DatHatBoy> was big barrels you left behind there
[3:55:01] <%demegodz> PUNCH
[3:55:02] <Monkeyweed21> 800 metal and 400 ceramic
[3:55:08] <%AncelDeLambert> supa PUNCH
[3:55:15] <mariogoo> his last name is bridges because you build bridges
[3:55:17] <ihaveahugepersonality> is this that UPS simulator?
[3:55:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @thehashslingingslashers there's a night time. This area started with it.
[3:55:21] <zenith0111> I HOPE THE ROAD IS SMALL
[3:55:30] <+yarob01> I knew Pat's obsession will make him enjoy and struggle with this game LUL
[3:55:32] <%logoth_> Why is the bridges logo a spider web
[3:55:33] <%Nyanlathotep> His last name is Bridges becasue it's the company he works for
[3:55:35] <%derap41> I hope the road is a loop de loop
[3:55:39] <Youwereeatenbyalid> it might just be exponential cost
[3:55:42] <sqointus> BACK BROKEN
[3:55:45] <%cureneckbeard> his last name is bridges because he works for a company named bridges that builds bridges
[3:55:45] <%Doomcoder> his middle name is porter because he can teleport
[3:55:48] <Baeltyr> its a footpath Kappa
[3:55:49] <%Bane_Kaikyo> and then cry
[3:55:49] <%dabeaminator> Are you gonna go back to those ghost ruins for the metal?
[3:55:51] <%Thenuclearwalrus> @logoth_ Because STRANDS
[3:55:52] <%audrus> what if the road is a grower not a shower
[3:55:55] <%bigirontarkus> its small as ur peepee Pat
[3:55:55] <%cureneckbeard> his name is sam because he can shoot missiles
[3:55:55] <PrimeNeverproc> big bridge energy
[3:55:58] <Fujiwara_92> BIG SMALL ROAD
[3:56:00] <+S1LENTxHERO> This game feels like what microtransactions are.
[3:56:01] <%ShichiNoBushi> All that material used to build support pillars for the previous roads.
[3:56:02] <+doe3879> the Yellow on the map is preview of the build
[3:56:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it's not exponential. It's just reflective of how much road there is
[3:56:03] <bashful_bard> Costs aren't exponential, but they are random
[3:56:05] <%demegodz> Nice slide
[3:56:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> @ihaveahugepersonality I think this game might just be an allegory for early childhood development
[3:56:06] <mayorrev> sliiiiide
[3:56:08] <hntronium> slider
[3:56:10] <jon651> maybe it's the final highway piece
[3:56:13] <%AncelDeLambert> you look so silly, Pat
[3:56:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat is getting addicted to delivery... hes becoming a MULE!
[3:56:15] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat It also requires a big bridge over a big chasm
[3:56:17] <+gatoralus> its really because of where it is placed in the terrain
[3:56:18] <%rytisone> It's not the size of the road, it's how you use it
[3:56:20] <KanukMunch> I hope the road is just SUPER WIDE, but it's just like 5 feet!
[3:56:21] <Edible_Enthusiasm> this road will have GIRTH
[3:56:22] <abatage> what episode is pat up to?
[3:56:25] <%joylent_blue> add to the length
[3:56:25] <%Thenuclearwalrus> 3
[3:56:27] <%wookie5358> Sam should change his name to Roadman
[3:56:29] <%logoth_> Why did I just see a picture of palpatine
[3:56:29] <+trustycoyote> Cost proportional to location?
[3:56:32] <mield916> you can see the length in the menu building it
[3:56:33] <%AncelDeLambert> @KanukMunch it's a parking lot

Also I expected a lot more spite when I said I like FO4 more than Outer Worlds - though like I said it has to be heavily modded. Unmodded it's the 2nd worst FO game only beating the 1st due to old game jank. 3rd worst if you count FO76, but why would you do that?

[4:26:56] <%king_wragles> @detritus25 considering it's not really.. 'subtle', I'd just call it advertising
[4:26:56] <ScreamLord> Kind of hilarious that after the apacolypes happened Monster is like...the only brand of Energy Drink to survive
[4:26:57] <Calamity2007> Whatever you say Smash player

[4:27:22] <+MooseyFate100> So disregarding that Hideo had anything to do with it is this a Good Game
[4:27:22] <%wookie5358> How do they drink that much monster without eating? You'd be a nauseous mess
[4:27:30] <cx_c2> just cover yourself in piss and shit, wouldnt it be like a shield against the BTs?

[4:28:54] <Habblewater> Where we're going we don't need roads
[4:29:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah but you can heal the vehicles you actually own
[4:29:00] <%ShichiNoBushi> In this game about delivering stuff, why wouldn't you prefer the first one and instead build a bunch of generators everywhere?
[4:29:03] <zenith0111> @crabslacks Roads aren't available everywhere like the mountains

[4:44:24] <%waifoong98> Secretly an Akira game Kappa
[4:44:29] <+Sento_vidya> Not having as easy access to stuff like this mustve hurt reviews a LOT
[4:44:33] <beetbo2> Norman Reedus's Ride Gameplay
[4:44:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hell yeah, post-apocalyptic motorbikes
[4:44:41] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Whatever happened to Pat's bridge?
[4:44:42] <%Omegaanimus> THIS is proof that some reviews did not play very far
[4:44:49] <%Ner234> Someone needs to mod some Eurobeat when this drops on PC LUL
[4:44:49] <%rytisone> *plays FF7 motorcycle chase music*
[4:44:51] <+MisterCrimson> Suddenly Motor Ball
[4:44:54] <%Omegaanimus> or else they wouldn't have said the game is ALL walking
[4:45:00] <%Doomcoder> hmm, at least all the reviews before the game came out were required to complete the game
[4:45:00] <+rfsb> ENERGY ZONE on the road, is this the new F-Zero?
[4:45:04] <space_coyote> Is it gay to suck your homie's dick?
[4:45:04] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Road + bike = saved you an hour of fucking walking :O
[4:45:05] <%Omegaanimus> because at this point vehicles are crucial
[4:45:06] <%Doomcoder> but they also weren't supposed to spoil stuff
[4:45:07] <%Thenuclearwalrus> @Ner234 People are gonna hack PC so bad LUL
[4:45:07] <+Tokanova> the reviewers probably didn't have the benefit of online cooperation stuff like this
[4:45:07] <zenith0111> @angriestpat I have to play offline and I'm so jealous right now
[4:45:12] <%LaughingCatt> Oh I just love this
[4:45:15] <+Tokanova> so they missed out on half the game
[4:45:15] <Clowns> they see me rollin, they hatin
[4:45:18] <+justianxix> this is all player made?
[4:45:21] <%Ner234> @Thenuclearwalrus It's gonna be nuts LUL
[4:45:21] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYEYEEYEYE
[4:45:25] <%Omegaanimus> the reviewers need to go back and play this again in a week
[4:45:27] <+Stevsux> @omegaanimus you're gonna eat those words before the end
[4:45:28] <%waifoong98> damn that 's some neat water effect

[4:45:30] <%DracaenaLeaf> Enough lol

[4:45:35] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[4:45:37] <HoIlywood_SN> @Omegaanimus its a well known fact that games journalists are all more or less brainless zygotes who flunked out of normal journalism so they try to do video games instead
[4:45:40] <@lewdskeletor13> breebuPog breebuPog breebuPog
[4:45:41] <mayorrev> Sam'd done with your BD

[4:45:54] <mayorrev> lol
[4:45:57] <mostundesired> LUL
[4:46:00] <Ion_Laser> @HoIlywood_SN Well the IGN ones anyway
[4:46:00] <%Doomcoder> like regardless of whether you agree with their reviews, they did spend 60-80 hours playing a game that many of them didn't even like
[4:46:04] <+rfsb> I generally think reviewers should finish games I can't believe that's a controversial statement in some circles
[4:46:06] <%Doomcoder> they're entitled to not like it
[4:46:07] <Idon__> So many pizzas
[4:46:23] <%Omegaanimus> The issue isn't them liking it or not
[4:46:25] <%Doomcoder> literally they were required to finish the game before reviewing it
[4:46:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> MORE ROAD
[4:46:32] <%Omegaanimus> the issue is many said the game was nothing but walking
[4:46:40] <Soul_Intern> fuck
[4:46:40] <+superkeaton> This game is like the entire ethos of the Courier from New Vegas, it's neat
[4:46:40] <%Doomcoder> at least one reviewer said that they couldn't review it because they couldn't bring themselves to finish it
[4:46:43] <zenith0111> Reviewers don't dictate what you buy anyways so who gives af about them
[4:46:44] <%Omegaanimus> either they didn't actually finish or they're misrepresenting the game
[4:46:46] <Charuzu> eh 50+ hours is hard to invest for most adults
[4:46:47] <%Doomcoder> they were probably trying not to spoil it
[4:46:53] <+Tokanova> just need metal and ceramics ye
[4:46:55] <%Omegaanimus> that's bullshit
[4:46:57] <HoIlywood_SN> i think a few of them lied about finishing the game
[4:47:00] <+VideoGameTim_> @Omegaanimus I mean, to people who arent into this type of gameplay its totally easy to see how they would feel that way
[4:47:01] <HoIlywood_SN> because what they said is clearly wrong
[4:47:03] <HoIlywood_SN> like
[4:47:05] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat how goes Kojima's Amazing FedEx World?
[4:47:08] <HoIlywood_SN> this entire stream proves them wrong
[4:47:18] <HoIlywood_SN> there are roads and driving and fighting and pizza delivery
[4:47:18] <%Omegaanimus> you aren't getting the point
[4:47:19] <%Doomcoder> I mean a lot of them complained about the final hours of the game being boring af
[4:47:19] <%waifoong98> convinient
[4:47:22] <%Omegaanimus> it's ok if they didn't finish it
[4:47:22] <fazoburquina> maybe that's an intersection too?
[4:47:24] <%Omegaanimus> but say so
[4:47:25] <%AncelDeLambert> this game is still 90% walking
[4:47:29] <%Doomcoder> no they literally were required to finish it
[4:47:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 800 METAL
[4:47:31] <%Explodincatz> always need metals the most
[4:47:31] <+Stevsux> @omegaanimus this isn't the end of the game dude
[4:47:33] <Habblewater> Game Reviewers should stream all their research gameplay
[4:47:34] <%Doomcoder> it was in the conditions of getting a pre-release copy
[4:47:36] <HoIlywood_SN> @Doomcoder how do you verify that
[4:47:39] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat 800 metal & 200 ceramics
[4:47:43] <%Omegaanimus> and if you did, then what excuse do you have for saying there are no vehicles?
[4:47:44] <HoIlywood_SN> how do you know they actually completed the game
[4:47:46] <NeroInfinite> 800 metal like what you get for a bridge
[4:47:47] <%Omegaanimus> THAT is the issue with the reviews
[4:47:48] <%CrabSlacks> check your private locker
[4:47:49] <zenith0111> @hoilywood_sn Chapter 4 is straight up Call of Duty
[4:47:55] <+VideoGameTim_> what reviews said there were no vehicles?
[4:47:56] <%Doomcoder> @Hollywood_SN if they talk about the game like they haven't beat it, Sony stops sending them pre-release copies
[4:47:57] <aeonicvector> @Doomcoder and given the gameplay loop, only way that ending COULD be THAT boring is Microwave hallway 2
[4:47:57] <Jar704> I’ve become obsessed with building roads
[4:48:00] <%Omegaanimus> MANY reviews are saying this game is NOTHING BUT WALKING
[4:48:03] <rumuloh> Port city, just drive the road
[4:48:06] <%Omegaanimus> which is un true
[4:48:06] <Picosunloaded> Private locker?
[4:48:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> engine boi
[4:48:06] <RenegadeEpsilon> wont the road degrade cause timefall?
[4:48:08] <+Tokanova> this kind of gameplay is great
[4:48:10] <%Doomcoder> which is probably part of the reason many of them specifically took issue with the ending of the game
[4:48:12] <%Doomcoder> proves they played it
[4:48:14] <NeroInfinite> yes
[4:48:15] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat MULE post box?
[4:48:19] <zenith0111> @renegadeepsilon Yes but the can be upkeeped
[4:48:20] <+atlasbot1> @AngriestPat You should sing
[4:48:22] <%AncelDeLambert> is today the day I have to teach the chat what "hyperbole" means?
[4:48:23] <$RubberFistFight> Wow, game reviewers were generally misleading and misrepresented the game because they simply didn't like it? Say it ain't so Kappa
[4:48:23] <%Omegaanimus> but that isn't what they're saying Doomcoder
[4:48:24] <+rfsb> Spicy take: this game is more deserving of the title "Minecraft Story Mode" than Telltale's game, and that's a compliment.
[4:48:24] <%demegodz> Just take the road and then turn right
[4:48:25] <Boegame> its really cool seeing the world fill out with roads and paths, i really want to play it
[4:48:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> mules might
[4:48:31] <superd4v3> @RenegadeEpsilon You can upgrade the roads to be timefall resistant
[4:48:32] <Lamedhos> game requires online interaction with other people to build stuff. If things weren't built, of course there would be a lot of walking
[4:48:35] <$SuperiorDelta> So... if the rain is harmful, why not fully cover-up in like a hazmat suit or something?
[4:48:37] <jetvillain> cutscenes are not doubt the worst part of the game
[4:48:38] <%Omegaanimus> they're misrepresenting the game
[4:48:42] <$ArtemisCroc> @Omegaanimus you're supposed to take reviews as individual experiences, reviewers can't be expected to look at every facet of a game when so much of it is optional, you know? At that point it's up to the consumer to be smart about how they read reviews
[4:48:45] <Fujiwara_92> Crater might
[4:48:46] <s_snowball> strawmen everywhere up in here
[4:48:50] <+Stevsux> @omegaanimus no reviews said the game was ALL walking and also, there's a literal mountain on the map he's traversing right now, last I checked vehicles dont do good on those
[4:48:50] <%Kiiper> Man, I just got my copy, looking forward to putting in a full 16 hour marathon after work tommorow
[4:48:51] <%Explodincatz> @rfsb i fully agree with that
[4:48:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 800 metal, 120 ceramics

[4:51:29] <jacknerik> Pat you should check the post boxes they might have some materials in the shared boxes
[4:51:32] <%Omegaanimus> are vehicles in the game?
[4:51:33] <%ShichiNoBushi> Off roadin'
[4:51:35] <%Aeoneth> That section of highway ends right above a river in the middle of the air
[4:51:35] <NephiStreams> pat's driving is impeccable
[4:51:37] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I wonder if there's any materials left over in post boxes along the highway
[4:51:38] <%xcompleasedad> ......... for now.

[4:54:33] <%Aeoneth> Pat please show us your crater before you end the stream
[4:54:34] <zenith0111> @anceldelambert Buildings deteriorate, not every location can be built on, and servers change what buildings you'll get
[4:54:37] <%ShichiNoBushi> I found one under construction, and they seem to require a resource I haven't identified yet.

[4:55:06] <%AncelDeLambert> @zenith0111 I'm just worried about the fun being lost when MOST stuff is built, even if it does rotate. Patching holes isn't as cool as trailblazing
[4:55:11] <SirDogBear> its pretty cool when people build all sorts of structures like safe houses and stuff near a distribution center, its like a truck stop or something

[5:01:21] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[5:01:25] <%Seraphile> "careful route selection"
[5:01:28] <%Doomcoder> if only timefall eroded some of these rocks
[5:01:29] <+joekuta71> at least there's a bridge
[5:01:30] <NephiStreams> I'm in fucking tears
[5:01:32] <Simicrisps> Break the physics by speeding over rocks like xQc did
[5:01:34] <valachi> @PrettyThickandStrongDyck Have fun knowing that entire ww2 part got cut and doesn't exist in the game. That whole character was just a waste of time.
[5:01:47] <+8framelag> it sucks that game doesn't allow for sequence breaking
[5:01:49] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @valachi no spoliers asshole

[5:01:59] <Cloontanglordo> @valachi no fucking way?
[5:01:59] <zenith0111> @doomcoder Old rock is still just rock only water can erode it apart
[5:02:03] <PrimeNeverproc> is the traversal music muted?
[5:02:05] <RunaRaseri> its called a stoppy
[5:02:08] <%Doomcoder> isn't... timefall... water
[5:02:08] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat your insurance premiums are gonna SUCK after this, man
[5:02:09] <arkv01> coolguy pat
[5:02:09] <%AncelDeLambert> jesus christ, Pat, steer
[5:02:14] <Mister_McDerp> do you aim for the rocks on purpose?
[5:02:17] <sethhilburn> real question, was there a point in time where there was one really big rock, as rocks come from crumbling off bigger ones. So even large ones must have crumbled off a big one
[5:02:24] <arkv01> did you know you can just buy your motorcycle license these days
[5:02:25] <AllJoeShow> i see hes going with the "brute force" method
[5:02:26] <%valriot> Time for a DUMB cutscene
[5:02:30] <SomeAsianDood> Pat never got his license guys, calm down Kappa
[5:02:30] <Dutchpotato> @cloontanglordo can confirm that dude is lying
[5:02:30] <Soulbishop> Does he know trikes can bunny hop too?
[5:02:33] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[5:02:34] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @valachi if it aint your cup of tea fine but why watch the stream?
[5:02:34] <deviljhojho_> sam mailman
[5:02:37] <zenith0111> @doomcoder Turns into water so it's not like being hit by rain drops
[5:02:44] <%AncelDeLambert> omg that animation with that camera
[5:02:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> well of course. You have to connect it first
[5:02:55] <Nina96> !uptime
[5:02:55] <%honeyman18> Helpful is nice, but have you considered putting ladders and ropes in useless places around the Distribution centers?
[5:02:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 2m.
[5:02:56] <kpokey> Bridges is right, I build the big ones - pat, probably
[5:02:57] <$Neryl_> @Soulbishop did someone say unsubscribe from super bunny hop?
[5:02:58] <%waifoong98> auto delivery bot huh
[5:03:02] <%Thenuclearwalrus> @PrettyThickandStrongDyck Because he wants to spread lies and try to ruin it for other people because he is a sad individual

[5:03:50] <%DedlokPM> S stands for Sawesome
[5:03:51] <%AncelDeLambert> are they afraid of catching the Norman Reedus? Is that why they won't come out to actually talk? Cuz of th eReedus?
[5:03:53] <+Tokanova> 👍
[5:03:56] <zenith0111> @doomcoder So in summation the water can erode them but Timefall cannot
[5:03:57] <Pnutz409> Jason Statham

[5:06:11] <Junkfist> I can't believe Kojima put Jeffrey Epstein in this game.
[5:06:11] <deviljhojho_> "yeah man these machines dont turn into nukes when they die, in fact they never die, PATHETIC"
[5:06:12] <Zombrocom> Aren't they better because they cant die?

[5:06:28] <Clowns> dying actually makes us superior to the robots!
[5:06:29] <ovan20> @AngriestPat why this game feels the need to spell out everything?

[5:06:30] <%Aeoneth> LITERALLY give me my WORST ratings
[5:06:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> understanding our own death means we strive to surpass our own limitations even more. Leading to progression, out of a fear of death.
[5:06:31] <detritus25> Kojima is an expert fart smeller

[5:15:24] <zenith0111> @prettythickandstrongdyck Bodily fluids only stun and are not a form of lethal attack
[5:15:33] <%CrabSlacks> you should be able to get hats for BB, just put them on the tank
[5:15:34] <%Swish19XX> Oh hey look a Codec
[5:15:34] <%Nyanlathotep> @shrodingersdogg It's a portrait of Steve Buscemi
[5:15:35] <%Doomcoder> just like in real life
[5:15:37] <%wookie5358> SAM sites? sweet. time to shoot down some jets
[5:15:39] <$EldritchBee> DEL TORO POLYGON AVATAR
[5:15:42] <@lewdskeletor13> Sam it’s me DEADMAN
[5:15:42] <detritus25> I wish I had Del Toro Codec.
[5:15:43] <%dabeaminator> @AngriestPat These are randomized by the way. You can totally get the same scene every time, so you've gotten pretty lucky.
[5:15:44] <Spyder1246> Pat, you told Woolie there was no Codec, & that it was all emails
[5:15:44] <Brofarian> Just ask the baby himself
[5:15:45] <FirearmsInstructor> 28 is your BB?
[5:15:49] <GrampsGrubberfly> basically shits locked
[5:15:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 2B
[5:16:00] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> @zenith0111 they seem useful though
[5:16:05] <%CrabSlacks> was your bike fixed?
[5:16:13] <deviljhojho_> WE NEED MORE POWER
[5:16:14] <illTemperedSeaBass> I don't like that babies have service records in this world.
[5:16:14] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Is there a difference to having BOTH cuffs on and only 1? Sam keeps putting his back on when he wakes up, and some chars don't have both attached. Does it matter? (Repeat because it was spammed off earlier.)
[5:16:14] <$vincerocmm> power bones
[5:16:18] <Monkeyweed21> Are they lobotomizing pregnant women to make Stillmothers?
[5:16:18] <@lewdskeletor13> Ye he has BB 28
[5:16:26] <%Nyanlathotep> @Spyder1246 In his defense, all codec calls are mandatory, all optional exposition is through e-mail
[5:16:29] <deviljhojho_> SAM, ITS ME, DIEHARDMAN
[5:16:32] <almutch213> Don't give up Power Skeleton
[5:16:34] <+8framelag> where's the option to wear the hat backwards??

[5:16:50] <%wookie5358> 2B? Or not 2B. That is the question, and I have a strong feeling it's coming knowing Kojima

[5:17:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ROBOTO
[5:17:07] <%ShichiNoBushi> I bet that old guy was surprised to see a robot show up at his door.
[5:17:10] <detritus25> Listen to me Sam. I only want your best interest. Me, KILL DIEHARD.
[5:17:23] <%Aeoneth> Always Build Boots Lv2, they're SO much better than 1s
