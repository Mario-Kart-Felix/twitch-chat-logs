[0:34:45] <%Lion_kun> Fortuneteller has an even more busted lightning move and its a red orb skill.
[0:34:48] <Blank9> legit, you would be maybe 80% as strong without doing any weapon upgrades or grinding, it's an easy fight
[0:34:54] <WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> Wait is that Akechi?

[0:35:11] <COMB711> Kiryu could
[0:35:13] <%machshop> i bet you can
[0:35:14] <%AtlasMcCoy> Pat you have an orbital laser
[0:35:16] <%Jaromero435> but what if you had an orbital laser?
[0:35:16] <%Kataguro> Laser them all
[0:35:16] <+chiazam> oooh boy
[0:35:18] <+krlos970> @WholesomeSandwhichPeddler Yes
[0:35:19] <%AtlasMcCoy> You can kill a thousand dudes
[0:35:19] <ahaegotrigger> Jesus
[0:35:24] <%nobleclonetrooper> not without Kiryu
[0:35:25] <%dylanhack> dylanhack subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Yo Pat, so I'm about to take a nap, I hope you have a good stream, say hi to babies for me pls
[0:35:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> so like other things
[0:35:29] <HedgehogGames1> An orbital laser could take 1000.
[0:35:29] <%Pandabear277> My theory still stands. Ichiban is probably okay with killing, unlike Kiryu.
[0:35:30] <+CapnClassix> Here me out
[0:35:30] <+chiazam> PRETTY SNEAKY SIS"
[0:35:32] <%Maxiav1> Thanks for the 2020Surprise @dylanhack

[0:35:35] <huntingst4r> yes
[0:35:37] <%artdoz> L A S E R T I M E!
[0:35:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> yes
[0:35:38] <%machshop> yes
[0:35:39] <%honeyman18> Just want him to hit a button and solve it all
[0:35:40] <+dante_must_die_exe> yeah
[0:35:40] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Yeah.
[0:35:40] <ahaegotrigger> Yes
[0:35:40] <%QuipSan> oh yeah
[0:35:41] <%Mr_Pylon> hell yeah I do
[0:35:41] <+chiazam> yes
[0:35:42] <cardamomo88> yep
[0:35:43] <ProfessorLuigi> Thanks for the thing @dylanhack
[0:35:44] <%Spydurman> yes
[0:35:44] <ScreamLord> With their bare hands
[0:35:44] <tsnakesrule> 5 as well
[0:35:45] <%soflicar> and 4
[0:35:45] <%Sausious> yeah but they're stupid
[0:35:45] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Yep
[0:35:47] <+Mahbonk> We can do it again
[0:35:49] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[0:35:50] <Brunty023> Sure do
[0:35:50] <+chiazam> But Ichiban is not Kiryu
[0:35:51] <+ianabstract> summon the roomba
[0:35:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THEY CAN
[0:35:52] <%hrbeck_> remember when they fought off zombie hordes?
[0:35:52] <Blank9> and 3, and then kiryu fought hundreds in 4, 5, and 6
[0:35:52] <%Tearonex> and 4
[0:35:52] <ketchuo13> and 0
[0:35:53] <%thelaxinator> The good thing about Kasuga is that he's not just soloing the thousand dudes, he has 3 other people.
[0:35:54] <redrins> they're also superhuman
[0:35:55] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Yeah and you're 4 people, so 4 hundreds
[0:35:56] <%Dunmarkh> yakuza -1
[0:35:57] <%barrakuta371> Nothing an orbital laser cant solve
[0:36:00] <fuji_92> yeah, time for Ichiban to do that I guess
[0:36:01] <%honeyman18> I mean, if the ghost is cannon, the laser should po uld be
[0:36:02] <%nobleclonetrooper> thats Kiryu tho
[0:36:04] <%hrbeck_> not yet
[0:36:07] <%promessav2> what is the max enemies on screen?
[0:36:10] <TyrianPurpleHaze> I feel like that's part of why Ichiban even exists: It was just getting too hard to justify Kiryu and Majima having any trouble with anyone
[0:36:12] <+Wilabeen1997> They both fought off the majority of the Omi in 2
[0:36:13] <%McSoliace> he's not weak though
[0:36:15] <+tigerfang86> HUGE LIES
[0:36:18] <toxicgad> Can kiryu defeat the thousands of bleach japan protestors
[0:36:19] <%murderof_crows> Majima killed guys with a truck in 3
[0:36:20] <HedgehogGames1> Remember when Kiryu punched a great white shark underwater and won?
[0:36:20] <+DigitalPelican> ichiban has an orbital laser
[0:36:21] <huntingst4r> your right he isn't Kiryu, but he has a laser
[0:36:22] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Seriously pat why did you grind to level 33.
[0:36:27] <Pyrrhus90> kiryu is kind of a monster tbh
[0:36:33] <%Kataguro> Kiryu is a force of nature at this point, despite being 50
[0:36:34] <cardamomo88> beg him
[0:36:35] <%Dunmarkh> @toxicgad yes
[0:36:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> Kiryu and Majima are getting old
[0:36:40] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Yo I missed the big respect women
[0:36:44] <%AtlasMcCoy> What about a game with Kiryu and Majima as OLD GERIATRIC MEN
[0:36:45] <%Kataguro> He's all bloody and cool afterwards too
[0:36:51] <albedo455> im happy Y1 dub kryu
[0:36:51] <%Sausious> kiryu gets shoty like 10 times in 6 and walks it off
[0:36:55] <Blank9> by 5, kiryu is legitimately considered a national level concern for any political plots, to steer clear of involving him
[0:36:58] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Hell, in Yakuza 0 Kiryu fights his way out of an entire Yakuza army by himself.
[0:37:00] <%Decombustion> being old only makes you more badass in yakuza tho
[0:37:01] <ahaegotrigger> oh yeah Majima stopped a Korean Mafia Invasion almost single handedly
[0:37:01] <%MonsterEnvy> You should only be level 27 or 8 at the end of this chapter.
[0:37:02] <%weissguard> Okay, but hear me out: Literal hail of gunfire kills Kiryu and Majima.
[0:37:02] <%radda343> majima's also fucking insane
[0:37:02] <%Yamchadassist> i love yakuza
[0:37:08] <tsnakesrule> Was it omi or Chinese mafia?
[0:37:09] <+chiazam> Majima felt like a boss character in Kiwami 2
[0:37:09] <Gameaholic42> So Kiryu basically has the Jotaro problem?
[0:37:19] <heartlesshealer> "As long as you're taking it"?
[0:37:19] <%Pandabear277> 400? I thought it was 1000!
[0:37:21] <%Kataguro> He IS a detective
[0:37:27] <Blank9> they would rather avoid Kiryu in a nationwide conspiracy than involve the US military in it, it's insane
[0:37:32] <+tigerfang86> KUME YOU BITCH
[0:37:34] <%coreyyotto> Kiryu and Jotaro are literally the same character
[0:37:37] <missingangle> fucking Kume
[0:37:38] <COMB711> Its insane how many people they destroy, and we're supposed to be like, woah this one guy killed 16 Yakuza
[0:37:40] <Saltmeisterr> AND THUMBTACKS
[0:37:41] <%Jaller101514> Zaoh's Voice Acting in this dub is great!
[0:37:41] <%Kataguro> Special guest from the Business Dimension
[0:37:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> where is homeless man
[0:37:47] <+Mahbonk> haha yes 3
[0:37:57] <%QuipSan> Eri not existing is so weird

[0:38:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BUT NO PAY
[0:38:09] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[0:38:11] <colzack_> That's why later on in the series it villains tried less to take out Kiryu by fighting him and tried more to outsmart him with schemes and going after those he loves
[0:38:13] <%coreyyotto> for people who missed a few streams, Nanba's in hiding like a bitch

[1:27:55] <missingangle> "Nice try, but I may be dumb, but I'm no idiot."
[1:27:55] <fIashman92> Avenge the pimp
[1:27:59] <GManx0> Even if ichiban let him go, korean vergil would kill him there
[1:28:00] <+tigerfang86> LIKE A HERO
[1:28:00] <%QueequegTheater> IMPOSSIBE
[1:28:01] <%Blackleafx> i thought they were talking about Arakawa, but he meant soapland man
[1:28:06] <cardamomo88> FOR THE CHILDREN
[1:28:06] <%Dunmarkh> FOR NONOMIYA THE NOBLE PIMP
[1:28:06] <%Blackleafx> Ichiban you worked for that guy for like 12 hours
[1:28:07] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @PatStaresAt It's crazy how little Ichiban gives a shit about the Tojo after 7 games of Kiryu being TOJO 4 LIFE
[1:28:07] <primarch_lupercal> he's doing it for the soapland
[1:28:10] <%Bt_Robot> So it's just a bunch or MRAs?
[1:28:12] <SaltyAzteca> Compassion is a rarity in the fevered pitch of corruption
[1:28:13] <+skyheys> This plot is so dumb I love it
[1:28:14] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> a man he knew for like 24 hours at best
[1:28:17] <seaechiowai> ok Jotaro
[1:28:18] <blue8moon> I only wanna kill the guy who killed my boss, you dragged me into the rest of this shit
[1:28:20] <huskarl_zap> Save the pimp's memory
[1:28:23] <silentblast93> because ichiban has some integrety
[1:28:24] <+SilverInferno3> I love you Adachi
[1:28:30] <%BoxNavy> you gotta respect it
[1:28:35] <%Kataguro> Cutscene #3
[1:28:36] <%sighphers> i love the plot but i hate that it hinges on the death of one utterly repulsive pimp
[1:28:37] <redrins> tojo is done anyway so why bother
[1:28:40] <+vaderxyz1970> NONOMIO DOESNT DISERVE THIS LOYALTY
[1:28:42] <akitanito> tojo addiction is real
[1:28:43] <%NovaKnightmare> My day be like so fine then boom Tojo....
[1:28:45] <%machshop> is that the first time he smoked since getting out of prison
[1:28:47] <%linSP> how many yakuza games
[1:28:47] <GigaSeifer> because Ichiban has the power of Nakama & Vidya gaems on his side
[1:28:48] <%televisedrevolting> Kiryu feels obligated because he fucked up once then everything was fucked for almost two decades.
[1:28:49] <%Mr_Pylon> there's nothing more important than my daugh-TOJO
[1:28:50] <+D00msDayDan> sounds like me and destiny
[1:28:51] <%Blackleafx> @PatStaresAt Tbh he also has a more personal relation to the Arakawa family and George Takei than the Tojo as a whole. Kiryu was more into the wider organization
[1:28:52] <Louie_Salmon> Oh man gotta heal up after all that talking
[1:28:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> wow a 3rd cutscene?
[1:28:56] <fIashman92> Why do they care so much about Nonomiya
[1:28:56] <%QuipSan> 6 was the worst its been
[1:28:56] <MasterTonberry23> EVERY game Kiryu would walk away, then the next game some dumb BS drags his ass back in!
[1:28:56] <Blank9> I legit thought the end of 4 was Kiryu rejoining the tojo, not just saejima's family starting
[1:28:56] <+rickelstiltskin> ICHIBAN TOO COOL TO CARE
[1:28:56] <cardamomo88> PLOT DUMP PART 3
[1:28:58] <1LostDude> Ichiban doesnt care about Tojo. He just luvs Arakawa
[1:29:00] <%Garthunox> Everytime he gets out THE PULL HIM BACK IN!
[1:29:02] <%Huntercd> Nonomiya was kinda a scumpbag but didn't deserve to die
[1:29:04] <goose_attack_almanac> He doesn't care about being a Yakuza or the Tojo clan. He seems to only care about Arakawa.
[1:29:04] <BrickleBork> smokin
[1:29:08] <ProfessorLuigi> All those answers hurt my ears
[1:29:09] <rafflespaddock> like kojima
[1:29:10] <%BoxNavy> tojo aint even tojo anymore so why would he give a shit
[1:29:11] <missingangle> Ichiban only really cares about Arakawa
[1:29:12] <%Blackleafx> PLOT DUMP: PART THREE
[1:29:13] <+reallybigrocks> Woah pat do you have enough MP for the orbital laser now? Have you used it?
[1:29:13] <tacoisgoods> This is a yakuzi game that you game where the hero doesn't really care about the yakuzi
[1:29:15] <ProfessorLuigi> Gotta have a few beers and a cig
[1:29:17] <%hrbeck_> well, that's because Ichiban knows what sex is
[1:29:17] <%dkthefriend> did you guys not pick up on bleach japan shouting "go back home" at the Geomijul gate, they are def conservative
[1:29:18] <%Jaller101514> Hes Arakawa for life, tho
[1:29:18] <%thelaxinator> Just wait until the recently reformed Tojo want to demolish Ichiban's Arcade for underprivileged orphans.
[1:29:18] <%Blackleafx> @goose_attack_almanac yea
[1:29:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> How many chapters till "them"?
[1:29:21] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> Ichibans aliance wasnt tojo It was ONLY arakawa
[1:29:23] <+SilverInferno3> Kiryu didn't have a cool boss like Kasuga
[1:29:26] <cardamomo88> KKK
[1:29:27] <%QueequegTheater> PHASE 2
[1:29:27] <bobbyratlair> Chat is nanba still MIA?

[1:30:19] <missingangle> Well, to be fair, Ichiban's not used to influence via media, what with being in prison for 18 years
[1:30:23] <%dkthefriend> Ryo Aoki's three k plan is literally war on crime/war on drugs
[1:30:23] <%sighphers> i'm here for gief and elmo tbh

[1:30:25] <missingangle> at least not to the extent it has become

[1:30:31] <ShichiNoBushi> Pat's a BBM.
[1:30:32] <rafflespaddock> he went to prison in 2000 not 1923
[1:30:33] <leinadtonu> Facecam killed the streamer
[1:30:33] <yeildingthought> Crazytalk Activate!

[1:31:05] <%st_jimmy456> kkk plan
[1:31:13] <%QueequegTheater> Defeated by the KKK
[1:31:14] <%Huntercd> He could have shot someone and wouldn't lose voters
[1:31:19] <%sirthomas2step> I really want to play this after all the moves I've seen
[1:31:19] <%dearghostss> wow it would be a shame if someone recorded this about the corrupt politician
[1:31:20] <%dkthefriend> most presidents are bad
[1:31:33] <passione13> Damn this dude is deepthroating
[1:31:36] <Ravingpyro> because they were afraid of him
[1:31:40] <%Blackleafx> Kiryu would punch
[1:31:40] <MasterTonberry23> Under Daigo its amazing the Tojo lasted as long as they did
[1:31:41] <%shurtal> Man, Daigo SUCKS OUT LOUD
[1:31:42] <%Kataguro> You can't just punch this
[1:31:44] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Yeah, Kiryu couldn't have done shit about this
[1:31:46] <%Garthunox> Kiryu cant punch this problem away
[1:31:48] <%dave323dave> daigo worst chairman
[1:31:50] <+loukemia83> Sure he can
[1:31:50] <+skyheys> @onethousandtomatoes fictionalized name for Japan's "Liberal Democratoc Party," their conservatives
[1:31:50] <%sighphers> also very realistic that he got his popularity from being 'tough on crime'
[1:31:51] <%miguelrod777> yes he coupd
[1:31:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YES HE CAN
[1:31:51] <COMB711> he could

[1:31:52] <iosephe> he totally could tho
[1:31:52] <digaogrunge> YES HE CAN
[1:31:52] <%BoxNavy> he COULD...
[1:31:53] <%TheWinged7> yes he can, hell do it
[1:31:53] <%QueequegTheater> Didn't he do that in 3
[1:31:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> FUCK YOU KIRYU CAN
[1:31:55] <1LostDude> Kiryu could definitely punch it away
[1:31:55] <%Blackleafx> Also yeah Kiryu got into this kind of situation in Yakuza 6 and he just bumbled through it
[1:31:55] <MSN04_Sazabi> Nah, he totally can
[1:31:56] <fIashman92> If Kiryu ran for Govoner he would win
[1:31:56] <%Huntercd> He could
[1:31:57] <brachydios777> Kiryu is the Atlus to the Tojo
[1:31:57] <missingangle> I mean, he COULD, but
[1:31:57] <ahaegotrigger> he Totally wouldve though LUL
[1:31:58] <%Garthunox> BUT MY FISTS THO!
[1:31:59] <Rusflex> ofc he can
[1:31:59] <%nobleclonetrooper> Yes he can
[1:31:59] <cardamomo88> YES HE CAN
[1:32:00] <GalaxyUni> Yes he can
[1:32:01] <fuji_92> u say that Pat
[1:32:01] <redrins> he did pretty much tell shinzo abe to eat shit
[1:32:01] <toadalonk> Yeah kiryu cant rock up and punch Politians LUL LUL
[1:32:02] <SilverInferno3> Yeah its great, Kasuga literally needed his allies to do all this
[1:32:03] <QuipSan> he would tho
[1:32:04] <Tinypidgenofdoom> Kiryu wouldnt punch a cripple
[1:32:07] <xbb1024> It brings the series more inline with real Yakuza falling in membership
[1:32:08] <MarvelousMrD> iunno hed probably get some votes if he head weaved some rockets on tv
[1:32:11] <toadalonk> Unless its Jingu
[1:32:11] <%toastybites> it just shows how weak the Tojo actually is
[1:32:12] <%nobleclonetrooper> @PatStaresAt He would do it in a heartbeat.
[1:32:13] <%Alazull> boty fortunately and unfortunately
[1:32:14] <dante_9x> Yes he can
[1:32:14] <%Dova573> Member wehn Kyriu was told by the prime minister to dissapear?
[1:32:14] <rosemon5001> yea counting the fact he should be ded
[1:32:14] <tukds> Yes he can pat!
[1:32:15] <artsupplies> he would punch but it wouldn't solve the problem
[1:32:16] <Blunder_Blue> My one issue with this plot is the fact that it's REAL hard to line up with Judgement. You can kinda wiggle it but the timeframe of the 3K Plan fucks things.
[1:32:18] <Louie_Salmon> He would have to punch the media
[1:32:20] <ahaegotrigger> Kiryu could do it and Helicopter his Shlong and Get 100% of the Vote
[1:32:21] <+tigerfang86> HUGE CLOUT
[1:32:21] <skyentombment> BUT HOW DID HE HEAL
[1:32:23] <%radda343> kiryu can't solve a problem he can't punch
[1:32:24] <%off_to_work_we_go> just put a mask on. officially he's dead
[1:32:27] <+tigerfang86> absolutely massive clout
[1:32:29] <bobbyratlair> Kiryu is like Luffy, if he punches something it political/economic problems are solved
[1:32:29] <Hellarussian> chotto a minute
[1:32:30] <%sighphers> he would punch all the cameras
[1:32:32] <akitanito> Kiryu would punch the cripple away before Masato became bad
[1:32:32] <%sirthomas2step> Tiger suplex the media
[1:32:33] <%shurtal> by the end of 6, if you said Kiryu suplexed the Yamato Mk. 2, i would believe you pat
[1:32:35] <HedgehogGames1> I would vote for Kiryu.
[1:32:37] <%Blackleafx> @skyentombment magic american medicine
[1:32:38] <+tigerfang86> the reason was MONEY
[1:32:40] <rafflespaddock> majima could get him out
[1:32:41] <tidalwafer> he would punch a governor though
[1:32:42] <olaksi> Yes
[1:32:42] <%QueequegTheater> @toastybites it literally falls apart when Kiryu, Saejima, and Majima are gone for ten minutes
[1:32:44] <%hrbeck_> and this ALL happened because of a boat
[1:32:45] <%rdark_ksu> they stayed quiet cuz $$$$
[1:32:46] <%QuipSan> Date is cool
[1:32:47] <+rickelstiltskin> I'd vote for majima
[1:32:48] <MarvelousMrD> detective fight between adachi and date
[1:32:49] <brachydios777> @skyentombment Paid a shit ton for medical treatment in America
[1:32:51] <%penitentpendant> Poor Adachi, The Replacement Date
[1:32:53] <CrypticMochi> I feel like Daigo would be fine if the universe didn’t conspire to screw him over with story drama
[1:32:59] <+SilverInferno3> Id play a Date game
[1:33:01] <%RealThiele> japan crime #1
[1:33:02] <+skyheys> DATE IS A MUMMY
[1:33:03] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @PatStaresAt Date & Adachi as a buddy cop thing would be fantastic.
[1:33:04] <primarch_lupercal> didnt he fail as much as daigo tho
[1:33:04] <MasterTonberry23> Hey guys remember the Yamato Mark II?
[1:33:04] <seaechiowai> Date is in the Kiryu dimension
[1:33:05] <cardamomo88> SECRET YAKUZAS
[1:33:06] <digaogrunge> Kiryu punched me once
[1:33:10] <skyentombment> @Blackleafx see, this worries me because it sounds like bullshit, but it could happen here

[1:36:34] <%off_to_work_we_go> ichi is allowed to hit old people he is also old
[1:36:35] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Yakuza 0 also shows that the Mad Dog persona is a front
[1:36:37] <TheAdMerlin> The Majima everywhere system proves Majima has high stealth skills
[1:36:38] <HedgehogGames1> Wasn't Majima kidnapped by the Omi Chairman?
[1:36:46] <%radda343> oh my god this guy's face texture is so bad you can see the seams

[1:37:23] <+pectusumbra> I think Mabuchi
[1:37:24] <%Blackleafx> thhe melon scene
[1:37:26] <+johnnychopsocky> those aren't seams. that's the dirt around the tape they took off
[1:37:27] <Ravingpyro> Majima is from Tokyo; the Kansai accent is fake.

[1:38:19] <bobbyratlair> You murdered a pimp I knew for 5 minutes? ILL KILL YOU
[1:38:20] <%QueequegTheater> Ichiban is so absurdly optimistic he can't even figure out that evil dudes are evil
[1:38:26] <%RealThiele> swole snake will win
[1:38:26] <MasterTonberry23> Even if Ichi didnt investigate the murder of Nonomiya, Mabuchi would have just tried something else
[1:38:30] <CelestialCage> @radda343 he had ducktape on his mouth. Tape marks when they got ripped off

[1:44:08] <1LostDude> @toadalonk No I'm talking in the grand plot of this story. A certain man in prison would've still gotten out and other certain events still would've progressed without any of this happening.
[1:44:10] <+SilverInferno3> @loukemia83 If Japan is like America then you can't really use illegally obtained evidence in court

As for development Ichiban doesn't actually develop much here other than he becomes a little bit more grounded in reality. His head is slightly less in video games. Most of Ichiban's character development is coming soon.
[1:53:10] <%krispen_wa> G U N
[1:53:11] <HypemasterMonty> Joon's best skills are towards the end, Divine Shot is fucking bonkers
[1:53:11] <%RetroCop87> uhgillaty
[1:53:11] <%Jaromero435> DIVINE SHOT
[1:53:12] <skyentombment> THAT IS A FUCKING MOVE
[1:53:12] <brachydios777> POWER OF GUN
[1:53:13] <SaltyAzteca> ESSENCE OF G U N
[1:53:13] <missingangle> And it's not like you can level up only one specific character via battle; it'll stay uneven like that lol
[1:53:13] <%Yamchadassist> A-Ghili-ty??
[1:53:14] <CelestialCage> I cast KILL
[1:53:15] <RaidenRising> GUN
[1:53:15] <huskarl_zap> GUN
[1:53:16] <MasterTonberry23> his base class is plenty strong honestly
[1:53:17] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Rapid slash but with gun, hes Vergil
[1:53:18] <Ravingpyro> he has some really cool shit in default
[1:53:20] <heartlesshealer> NECK TWISTER
[1:53:22] <CelestialCage> OH JESUS
[1:53:23] <%Kitafin> Phantom Drive!
[1:53:23] <%PsyqualiaSE> Hitman is the best job in the entire game
[1:53:24] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Divine shot is great
[1:53:24] <Hellarussian> a little bit
[1:53:25] <%machshop> LUL
[1:53:27] <fIashman92> Rapid shot is good for the exp hobos
[1:53:27] <%TissueBoxDan> ESSENCE OF PHANTOM DRIVE
[1:53:28] <uncle_speeps> head trauma does like a thousand damage for 6 mp
[1:53:28] <%Wiseblood_79> You can put him in the Yakuza 6 outfit
[1:53:28] <Zbyrd0961> hitman is sick
[1:53:29] <akitanito> host is fine
[1:53:29] <%st_jimmy456> you must increase your BOND
[1:53:30] <%Blackleafx> BODYGUARD LOOKS GOOD
[1:53:30] <Brunty023> Hitman is his best by far
[1:53:31] <%Alazull> You can put him in the clothes from 6
[1:53:31] <%goose_attack_almanac> Rapid Shot does more than half the Metal Slime health. It's amazingg
[1:53:31] <%MonsterEnvy> Hitman is pretty good
[1:53:32] <%SunnyVarietyPack> Hitman is one of the best classes, i almost never change him
[1:53:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> no bodygaurd?
[1:53:33] <Blunder_Blue> OOH MAKE HIM BODYGUARD FOR THE KATANA!
[1:53:33] <%sighphers> we can't really call him vergil if he uses guns tbh :(
[1:53:34] <tsnakesrule> cool plot dump is done, i can watch again
[1:53:34] <%StaceMcGate> TIME TO BOND WITH HIM
[1:53:34] <TheHeroAppears> you'll like his costume pat
[1:53:35] <TyrianPurpleHaze> He looks good in Bodyguard and Host at least
[1:53:35] <%charp35> You can change is job costume to his
[1:53:35] <+rickelstiltskin> you dare slander korean virgil
[1:53:36] <%Garthunox> He can use Akiyamas costume
[1:53:38] <+zanzibar_junker> his drink links are great
[1:53:38] <UlriktheSlayer1> bodyguard looks cool tho
[1:53:41] <%BoxNavy> you skipped over his breaker outfit
[1:53:43] <%krispen_wa> Can you make him look like original Vergil?
[1:53:44] <Pakooboomi> how do you get the full cyber armor set?
[1:53:44] <MasterTonberry23> theres so many good ideas in this game, that can be great ideas in a sequel
[1:53:44] <%AzureGale> Hitman? Is he Korean Agent 47?
[1:53:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> wait yes bodygaurd
[1:53:46] <ItsZelus> USE YAKUZA 6 OUTFIT
[1:53:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> I bet alternate costumes are great
[1:53:47] <heartlesshealer> sure
[1:53:47] <%dkthefriend> banshee is good bc it makes him unhittable for a turn
[1:53:52] <brachydios777> BODY GUARD
[1:53:53] <PageofHeart> TRICK-GUN-SWORD-ROYAL GUARD
[1:53:53] <CelestialCage> BREAKER outfit?
[1:53:55] <cardamomo88> HE IS COOL PAT
[1:53:56] <%thelaxinator> The most fantasy part of this game is the availability of jobs with advancement potential.
[1:53:58] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @PatStaresAt You can give Han his Yakuza 6 outfit
[1:54:01] <%Alazull> That shield looks so dumb I love it
[1:54:02] <%RealThiele> put Zhong Li in the party anyways, hes cool
[1:54:07] <%HedgehogGames1> Hitman is the best job.
[1:54:19] <%Kataguro> Won't the training gear give you a bad first taste of him?
[1:54:21] <%krispen_wa> Zhong Li ain't shit compared to Ningguang
[1:54:22] <%MonsterEnvy> Han's is just at the proper level for the story
[1:54:24] <%AzureGale> Why did we get the guy and not the leader lady
[1:54:26] <NitronStreams> Ichiban needs a gun move so you can make team ALL GUNS
[1:54:27] <%BoxNavy> cybor
[1:54:27] <MasterTonberry23> Zhaos's being murdered! but lets go shopping real quick
[1:54:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> make him a bodygaurd so he can be vergil
[1:54:34] <xbb1024> she making cosplay for them
[1:54:38] <%COMB711> can you make him a weapon
[1:54:38] <%MelBrooksKA> Just ignore the teleporters
[1:54:40] <%RealThiele> Geomommy is best true
[1:54:41] <VritraReiRei> Hey so im not far enough in my playthrough to try it out yet but can you swap party members mid battle and if so, does it use up a turn?
[1:54:46] <MasterTonberry23> @AzureGale Bcause korean vergil!
[1:54:49] <%Alazull> @AzureGale Because she is the literal leader of her gang
[1:54:51] <1LostDude> @AzureGale Cuz she's busy running the Gummybears

[1:57:38] <$apolitenoob> @patriotrenegade What if he peed honey
[1:57:40] <brachydios777> Your average wasp themed super hero at day , but at night he’s DR. BEEEEEEEEEEEES!
[1:57:46] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It's crazy how much can collecting he was doing while peeing. Absolutely crazy.
[1:57:47] <%RealThiele> +20 all levels thanks
[1:57:48] <tattleworm> the dumb part is cheating the currency to buy beehives and not just cheating the beehives themselves
[1:57:51] <%Standard_Enemy> Pat putting that one CS class he took in college to good use
[1:58:16] <+thefishofwar> I'm too used to the YouTube vods, just tried to skip ahead
[1:58:18] <1LostDude> @tattleworm It's harder to cheat the items. At least I think it is.
[1:58:29] <%StaceMcGate> Cheaters never win in Yakuza Pat
[1:58:36] <seaechiowai> @engwithan_elder_god he is drinking and pissing away cans of soda as we speak
[1:58:38] <huskarl_zap> inb4 microtransaction buys crafting materials
[1:58:53] <OneThousandTomatoes> Real Yakuza don't cheat
[1:58:58] <%patriotrenegade> no the Pain cums honey
[1:59:04] <1LostDude> @StaceMcGate Lies. Cheaters always win in Yakuza, until a main character shows up.
[1:59:10] <%StaceMcGate> the honorable Yakuza would never cheat or swindle
[1:59:13] <%Jaromero435> cheating is totally a Yakuza thing
[1:59:25] <%Jaromero435> cheat honorably
[1:59:28] <+tigerfang86> yakuza would cheat
[1:59:29] <xxshadowxx416> is pat a liar and cheater he really bee it up
[1:59:29] <NitronStreams> I cant believe Pat would circumvent the system in this Crime game
[1:59:30] <primarch_lupercal> Kiryu totally cheats by being a main character
[1:59:33] <+tigerfang86> like how yaz
[1:59:35] <murdock_465> real yakuza are super honorable you guys
[1:59:43] <+tigerfang86> like how yakuza use gamepads
[1:59:43] <%Standard_Enemy> Majima uses game shark
[1:59:57] <%Standard_Enemy> Ichiban grinds like a real gamer
[1:59:59] <%StaceMcGate> Ichiban would grind dungeons for 3 hours like a real hero
[2:00:02] <%StaceMcGate> for mats
[2:00:03] <TheHeroAppears> sure is a long piss hmm
[2:00:03] <%FboyDaKing> for everyone tuning in PAT IS TAKING A HUGE SHIT RIGHT NOW
[2:00:05] <%Jaromero435> Yakuza cheat, but it's fine because you know they cheat, so its honorable
[2:00:06] <Maleicus> i wonder how many points he'll give himself
[2:00:09] <cardamomo88> CHEATS LIKE A YAKUZI
[2:00:15] <1LostDude> @StaceMcGate Also, is it canonical that Kiryuu cheats in minigames with cheat items?
[2:00:21] <+thefishofwar> Ichiban likes the grind too
[2:00:22] <ricky12k1> Well this is a loooooooong pee pat.
[2:00:37] <digaogrunge> L O N G P I S S
[2:00:37] <sponsoredviewer910> long pee, time to see the doctor
[2:00:37] <OneThousandTomatoes> is the dog also peeing?

[2:04:43] <%goose_attack_almanac> @QueequegTheater Korean Magic.
[2:04:43] <Brunty023> His entire Hitman move list is broken! It's amazing!
[2:04:46] <+King_floppy> thunder attack! so good to have
[2:04:47] <%Alazull> Realistically you want to get him the Bodyguard charge move, and like the Musician's MP drain
[2:04:47] <%hahaha1171> pat give him the kimchi
[2:04:51] <%Alazull> But that's about it
[2:04:51] <cardamomo88> LET HIM FIGHT
[2:04:53] <%televisedrevolting> Put it on him during a boss.
[2:04:55] <+loukemia83> Agility
[2:04:57] <%Standard_Enemy> He'll catch up quickly
[2:04:58] <%COMB711> no
[2:04:59] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt What color is Hoon, white or black
[2:05:00] <redrins> no
[2:05:02] <%Jaromero435> HE HAS SO MUCH AGILITY
[2:05:03] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt he is all physical/agility
[2:05:04] <%SunnyVarietyPack> do you have his job increase exxperience on him?
[2:05:05] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> Its worth shit all on these lv 10 enemies
[2:05:05] <colzack_> Blunt and gun
[2:05:06] <thebalticguy1> Hes almost all physical
[2:05:07] <%GalacticaPhanto> Imagine Estinien without the shitty personality and actually funny
[2:05:08] <%McSoliace> pat i think you ruined your own chance of having even number level ups
[2:05:10] <%PigGuy800> oh good lord the kimchi
[2:05:12] <OneThousandTomatoes> does he have a special kimchi thing?
[2:05:13] <championofsomeone> agility
[2:05:14] <%hahaha1171> n
[2:05:15] <%honeyman18> only if it has the staff
[2:05:17] <%coreyyotto> magic skills have a special icon, so no
[2:05:18] <heartlesshealer> seemed like physical
[2:05:18] <huskarl_zap> Hungarian Draggon dismounting to punch the lithuainian hand gunners

[2:05:21] <%Monkeyweed21> give him one of adachis rings
[2:05:22] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> he is so fast that on higher levels he can act twice before the enemies
[2:05:23] <%otakusquarefan> Crit is really good on him
[2:05:24] <wrydiculous> oh yea kimchi
[2:05:28] <%supersugoisenpai1> I think it's only magic if it has the staff symbol
[2:05:28] <%Jaromero435> DEX = Crits
[2:05:33] <@commanderclaw> Korean Vergil no longer, he is now Korean Estinien
[2:05:33] <%Alazull> Wow guys he's Korean so give him Kimchi huh?
[2:05:35] <%Dunmarkh> SIDE QUEST???
[2:05:37] <VritraReiRei> Only thing I dont like about this game is they use RED to indicate a POSITIVE stat change.
[2:05:43] <1LostDude> DEX = crits and/or accuracy
[2:05:44] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @PatStaresAt Would you say Joon-gi Han's the Black Ranger or the White Ranger?
[2:05:54] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> @patstaresat If you upgrade his agility enough, he can go twice in one turn.
[2:06:00] <%logoth_> Level 9
[2:06:01] <huskarl_zap> dead
[2:06:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> I mean he has the hair
[2:06:06] <CelestialCage> casual murder

[2:06:12] <%RealThiele> dick twisted
[2:06:23] <huskarl_zap> BAG TOOTERS PogChamp PogChamp
[2:06:30] <OneThousandTomatoes> wait if koreans are elves estinien makes even more senese
[2:06:31] <%krispen_wa> so is Vergil gonna eventually replace Eri as stronkest party member?
[2:06:33] <%TUMZtwitch> TOTE THIS
[2:06:33] <TheHeroAppears> I beat the game and still don't have that stupid bat pat has
[2:06:37] <%the22cstomp> he even says too easy
[2:06:37] <OneThousandTomatoes> sense*
[2:06:39] <%McSoliace> he's just cooler freelancer
[2:06:42] <SaltyAzteca> WHERE'S YOUR MOTIVATION
[2:06:43] <NeroInfinite> OYTAKU
[2:06:43] <%StaceMcGate> yes
[2:06:44] <Pookiedaexzile> No
[2:06:45] <Saltmeisterr> nah
[2:06:46] <thebalticguy1> YES
[2:06:48] <%coreyyotto> Eri is still better for multi-target attacks
[2:06:48] <cardamomo88> YES HE WILL
[2:06:53] <GigaSeifer> no, not even close
[2:06:53] <fuji_92> no
[2:06:53] <%AtlasMcCoy> Thumbtacks are too strong
[2:06:54] <+zanzibar_junker> Vergil is the fastest
[2:06:57] <%GalacticaPhanto> @theheroappears That's because he has endgame weapons
[2:06:57] <%dashmatt> MEEEE!!!
[2:07:00] <bobbyratlair> @TheHeroAppears its pat what do you expect lmao
[2:07:00] <+Tadashi047> eri has thumbtacks
[2:07:00] <PageofHeart> He needs more power
[2:07:01] <RaidenRising> BASED KOREAN VERGIL
[2:07:02] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> @TheHeroAppears Upgrade the original bat
[2:07:05] <%slrls_> you can tag out party members in fights, so use them all
[2:07:05] <%hahaha1171> he's the best yes
[2:07:06] <VritraReiRei> Why not both? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2:07:12] <+thefishofwar> He needs more crime power
[2:07:13] <%Jaromero435> Just lvl Musician and everyone can be a healer
[2:07:13] <CelestialCage> Zhao has the best attack gamage doesnt he
[2:07:14] <+loukemia83> Darts is super strong
[2:07:18] <%Solipsist_Construct> I found all the characters situational at the endgame
[2:07:20] <jojomzo> @PatStaresAt You can heal with items
[2:07:20] <%COMB711> whaaa, Shao. What are ya talkin about?
[2:07:20] <%logoth_> Having Joon going "MEEEEE" seems weird
[2:07:22] <+loukemia83> if Eri is a Dealer
[2:07:23] <Saltmeisterr> why not constantly swap?
[2:07:23] <fuji_92> vergil is strong and fast, but not the strongest... That's eri
[2:07:27] <%Lion_kun> Saeko with Matriarch is sick
[2:07:27] <CurrySauseBandit> Why dump them? You can switch mud combat
[2:07:27] <%StaceMcGate> drop adachi
[2:07:29] <cheerthisdan> Everyone is genuinely viable
[2:07:29] <+rickelstiltskin> Or Kergil
[2:07:31] <xbb1024> bench Namba
[2:07:31] <%l3sovikk> I said that too, then I got Zhao
[2:07:32] <jojomzo> the items pat
[2:07:34] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> Zhao is cooler than ERI and hes not locked to the Buisness demension
[2:07:35] <%Cozy90> im not a fan of saeko
[2:07:36] <%SunnyVarietyPack> hit man is such a broken class
[2:07:36] <%Dakuu75> I need more POWER~!
[2:07:37] <+Mitchellsocks> Joon's supposed to be a really good party member
[2:07:37] <redrins> not yet
[2:07:40] <Brunty023> He will eventually
[2:07:40] <fIashman92> You really don't need a healer for this game
[2:07:40] <%GalacticaPhanto> Zhao as Breaker is busted
[2:07:40] <thebalticguy1> Not yet
[2:07:42] <Ravingpyro> h
[2:07:42] <%QuipSan> not yet
[2:07:43] <+FlyingRamen> my endgame team was joon gi, eri dominatrix, and saeko idol
[2:07:43] <NitronStreams> drop Ichiban Kappa
[2:07:43] <wrydiculous> not yet
[2:07:43] <TheHeroAppears> @Tinypidgenofdoom I still don't have enough money for the 20 mil upgrade
[2:07:43] <%bread_assassin> Pat, why do you need a healer if you’re so over-leveled?
[2:07:44] <%coreyyotto> Realistically, you're gonna be swapping out between a primary and secondary party lineup for some of the later sections
[2:07:45] <Sofa_King_Hype> Eri has AOE
[2:07:47] <%Jaromero435> He gets a great AOE later
[2:07:48] <colzack_> He gets a good AOE later on
[2:07:49] <iosephe> He'll get a great one
[2:07:52] <%krispen_wa> DED
[2:07:52] <+tetraes> he gets one
[2:07:52] <%TUMZtwitch> THUMBTACKS
[2:07:53] <%hahaha1171> later
[2:07:55] <toadalonk> Hitman is the strongest class in game
[2:07:55] <Blank9> han becomes the best enforcer in the game
[2:07:55] <FistTheWizard> Divine shot is a great AOE
[2:07:56] <+paladinstarbuster> fuuuck
[2:07:57] <1LostDude> Eh at the end of the day the only thing that matters is large scale aoe atks
[2:07:58] <%TUMZtwitch> Every time
[2:08:03] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> matriarch eri can carry trough the arena
[2:08:05] <GustauveVIII> DEALER
[2:08:06] <redrins> night queen is real good
[2:08:06] <%HedgehogGames1> Joon Gi will learn the best AOE
[2:08:06] <%Garthunox> Joon Gi has the best AOE
[2:08:08] <thebalticguy1> Eri's best is dealer
[2:08:08] <%RealThiele> GET FUCKED
[2:08:09] <+Raspada_Ryner> @PatStaresAt You can switch them mid-combat, which you'll probably do a lot late game
[2:08:10] <OneThousandTomatoes> matriarch
[2:08:11] <%ShoggothLibrarian> Oh, did they finally fix the English "WEAK" thing?
[2:08:11] <%Dakuu75> ...
[2:08:11] <%SunnyVarietyPack> i do matirach
[2:08:13] <TheHeroAppears> I like Idol
[2:08:13] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> @TheHeroAppears Do the buisness minigame for like 30 minutes
[2:08:15] <bobbyratlair> I love how crispy that move sounds lmao
[2:08:15] <xbb1024> That's good, because it means many builds work
[2:08:15] <toadalonk> DEALER
[2:08:16] <artsupplies> i like night queen because its funny
[2:08:16] <%slrls_> Dealer is a killing machine against single targets
[2:08:18] <+Jaysky> Yep
[2:08:19] <%Garthunox> Dealer is fantastic on Eri
[2:08:20] <Louie_Salmon> Dealer or her default definitely
[2:08:21] <GustauveVIII> USE ERI'S DARTS
[2:08:22] <cardamomo88> DEALER IS SO GOOD
[2:08:23] <BigShay93> dealer
[2:08:23] <+GingerStrawhat> I used her as a Night Queen and she just fucking DUMPED out Damage
[2:08:24] <GustauveVIII> HOLY SHIT DARTS IS BUSTED
[2:08:28] <%Cozy90> i like clerk
[2:08:28] <Naho_Saenoki> @JusTTheGuyYouNeed Matriarch is a broken class for the stat boosts alone though.
[2:08:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Why don't most people just shoot in these games
[2:08:31] <+loukemia83> Dealer has one of the best attacks in the game
[2:08:31] <nimbus272> dealer is probably best for eri but i prefer matriarch
[2:08:32] <Zarkith> I put Eri on Idol and it felt pretty effective on her
[2:08:34] <toadalonk> DEALER IS BEST
[2:08:34] <%king_wragles> Eri doesn't have a bad class, but she has situationally better classes between the 3 you just said @PatStaresAt
[2:08:34] <%Lion_kun> MATRIARCH THOUGH
[2:08:37] <redrins> night queen has brainwash, it makes combat trivial
[2:08:38] <toadalonk> THE AIRSTRIKE
[2:08:41] <1LostDude> nightqueen is good at single target dps. Not too useful IMO
[2:08:45] <jorniev> UUUUUH
[2:08:46] <MasterTonberry23> many dudes
[2:08:49] <%slrls_> Imagine if you could throw every thumbtack at a single person. That's dealer.
[2:08:50] <Pookiedaexzile> They literally would be dead if one person in this crowd of 20 had a gun
[2:08:52] <huskarl_zap> sad bag
[2:08:53] <%RealThiele> sweaty men
[2:08:53] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Eri basically has no "bad" classes, so it's hard to say what she's best for
[2:08:57] <jorniev> THAT OTHER GUY TOOK OVER
[2:08:58] <akitanito> just thumbtack them
[2:08:59] <huskarl_zap> oh its pit licker

[2:11:18] <thebalticguy1> rapid shot
[2:11:19] <TyrianPurpleHaze> I think only Kiryu isn't weak to guns
[2:11:20] <OneThousandTomatoes> guns and money are the true meta
[2:11:20] <%barrakuta371> Oh no guns! my one weakness
[2:11:23] <%dkthefriend> the closest thing I think of tone wise is fast and the furious but even that's not exact
[2:11:23] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> Bet they are weak to orbital lasers too
[2:11:28] <%Monkeyweed21> HEAD TRAUMA
[2:11:28] <%patriotrenegade> I CAST FIST

[2:11:40] <+TheBitingIrish> @huskarl_zap Matriarch
[2:11:43] <%krispen_wa> Just ganging on him

[2:11:53] <%the22cstomp> man he's just getting bullied
[2:11:54] <notsoy> do his head trauma move, i think you'll recognize it
[2:11:55] <%Dakuu75> no mercy
[2:11:57] <+loukemia83> When it's 4 on 1 and you have max bond, you just beat on the dude
[2:11:57] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Admittedly, Zheng can really take a hit
[2:11:57] <MasterTonberry23> punched him in the ass
[2:11:58] <colzack_> Head Trauma is lowkey one of his best moves cause it only costs 6 mp and does a lot of damage
[2:12:01] <bobbyratlair> you are BULLYING this man
[2:12:07] <Xodious987> Amazing how slightly more difficult (read, slower) the game is when you dont farm management into oblivion and trivialize the whole game rooDerp
[2:12:11] <xbb1024> as you can see, they don't kill anyone
[2:12:13] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> Zheng has that "i was going to be a party member but Zhao was picked"
[2:12:14] <cardamomo88> he bodie him so hard
[2:12:30] <+Jaysky> Use armpit
[2:12:30] <OneThousandTomatoes> kill him
[2:12:31] <linkoftermina> hi pat!

[2:12:42] <%QuipSan> LUL
[2:12:45] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @PatStaresAt They're bullying him in this cutscene as hard as you bullied him in that fight
[2:12:47] <%TUMZtwitch> Look at that CHROME DOME
[2:12:48] <%UvBenServed> Then they just start shoving him like Raiden in MKX
[2:12:48] <%AtlasMcCoy> Immediately caves

[2:12:52] <cardamomo88> SHOW HIM THE ARMPIT
[2:12:52] <artsupplies> its ching jin
[2:12:53] <@SoFarFetched> "Why did you guys go after me when I was trying to murder you guys for money???"
[2:12:59] <olaksi> Time to torture - tickle his armpits
[2:13:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Save New Majima
[2:13:02] <%spitelite> zheng is a bitch
[2:13:04] <MasterTonberry23> Is he torturing him? Yeah probably
[2:13:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> qi is pronounced like chi
[2:13:07] <wrydiculous> yup
[2:13:14] <%Dakuu75> If these were literally ANY other ppl, then they'd all be killed not jsut "beat up"
[2:13:23] <NitronStreams> yeah i think "q" is pronounced "ch"
[2:13:31] <%TUMZtwitch> CLAWS?
[2:13:33] <%TissueBoxDan> dont mean to backseat but u have a substory available
[2:13:34] <%HedgehogGames1> Q is Ch for Chinese words.
[2:13:38] <ProfessorLuigi> I guess it's closest to something like Ching-Jeen
[2:13:49] <%TUMZtwitch> Yo snikt snikt!
[2:13:52] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Yeah, in Pinyin, "Q" is pronounced with a "Ch" sound
[2:13:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Like Quan Chi
[2:13:57] <wrydiculous> almost pronounced like "ch" , to be exact
[2:13:57] <%patriotrenegade> I always pronounced "Qing" as "King"
[2:14:00] <1LostDude> @Dakuu75 nah it's all in ichiban's head. They're actually competing in talk no jutsu
[2:14:06] <Idon__> Yo, it's the heartbreaker shot from Hajime no Ippo
[2:14:06] <%dkthefriend> Zhao is like, the middle point between Majima's actual personality and the Mad Dog persona
[2:14:13] <huskarl_zap> China is name after emperor Qing
[2:14:14] <%krispen_wa> BAH GAWD, THE CHAIR

[2:58:26] <%SunnyVarietyPack> the staff symbol
[2:58:26] <%Jaromero435> Staff = Magic
[2:58:26] <redrins> the ones with the cane symbol
[2:58:26] <fuji_92> no
[2:58:27] <%dkthefriend> the staff symbol
[2:58:28] <PkSilent01> a staff is magic
[2:58:28] <jojomzo> Skills with a magic Staff next to them
[2:58:28] <akitanito> only the ones with symbol
[2:58:28] <Jnkolm> I think magic skills use magic

[2:59:13] <watts121> Eri is crazy good as a Matriarch if you wanna use the cheater DLC jobs.
[2:59:14] <%wruce__billis> summon birds is not magic, it does blunt damage iirc
[2:59:15] <%coreyyotto> Fist skills scale on STR, Blade and Gun skills scale on STR and DEX, and magic skills have a Staff icon next to them
[2:59:24] <%NeedlesD> theres substories if'n ya dont want to do plot right away.

[2:59:56] <%Blackleafx> "superheated stank"
[3:00:01] <akitanito> whif
[3:00:10] <%Dunmarkh> fart gas
[3:00:17] <Dr00_PhD> And its a character skill so all jobs can use it
[3:00:21] <+tigerfang86> FART GAS FIRE

[3:00:37] <%QueequegTheater> GRIND TIME GOOOOOO
[3:00:39] <watts121> @Blackleafx ah I see, is he waiting for black market weapons to go full in on them?
[3:00:43] <%thelaxinator> If there's a complaint I'd have for the game it's that the basic battle theme isn't enough of a banger for a 100 hour RPG.
[3:00:45] <Maleicus> do the story a little more
[3:00:46] <+tigerfang86> BIG GRIND NOW
[3:00:48] <Jnkolm> Pigeons are not an AoE
[3:00:59] <cardamomo88> PARK
[3:01:01] <watts121> I would probably wait for the final party member before grinding
[3:01:03] <%Blackleafx> @watts121 no hes just leveling each job a bit at a time instead of going all in
[3:01:15] <BlueTunicLink> It would be cool if they had different battle themes for different parts of town
[3:01:21] <Ravingpyro> !uptime
[3:01:22] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 1m.
[3:01:29] <%TenderBabyBacon> @thelaxinator not gonna say you are wrong, but i loved it all through
[3:01:29] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> there are only 2 sub stories, if you do the story first more will unlock
[3:01:31] <%coreyyotto> super best friends, you might say
[3:01:33] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt Power doesn't matter... unless Soujimaru shows up again!
[3:01:34] <jojomzo> @PatStaresAt Do story more till thing happens, it's pretty soon
[3:01:41] <watts121> @BlueTunicLink the other towns have different battle music

[3:03:32] <%JeanGardner99> when is the next area 2 chapters?
[3:03:33] <Guardiansaiyan> S U S
[3:03:34] <thebalticguy1> My guess is Joon gi's actor has a contract
[3:03:36] <%spitelite> what level was namba before he left
[3:03:36] <%Bt_Robot> YES PEE AND NOT USE A TRAINER TO GET NEW GEAR FOR EVERYBODY AND EXTRA XP

[3:03:45] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> now watch as Nanba instantly gains 3 levels of friendship
[3:03:48] <%Standard_Enemy> PISS ON THE CHEAT TABLE
[3:03:48] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> WICKED PISSAH
[3:03:49] <%wruce__billis> @GingerStrawhat I found it easiest just to give Han and Zhao bonsai trees over and over
[3:04:04] <%Mantorok06> Pat the Cheat
[3:04:07] <%coreyyotto> next area is either chapter 10 or 11 can't remember
[3:04:14] <+Anonymasque> Pissy cheats activate~
[3:04:18] <+tawdymcstoic> 11
[3:04:26] <silvcrest> han loves roses
[3:04:29] <Jnkolm> Yea the cabaret club was pretty handy to catch the lads up in bond. Also there are cabaret challenges you can knock out
[3:04:33] <watts121> @spitelite he's locked at rank 2 until he returns, and he doesn't build up bond before that so he would only be at level 2
[3:04:37] <mothmal> wait, ive finished the game, how do you give them bonsai trees??
[3:04:42] <%wruce__billis> How would he be cheating right now?
[3:04:43] <Giztech> @Mantorok06 shall we cheat the pat then?
[3:04:45] <%Standard_Enemy> NumPad0 = Infinite Piss
[3:04:56] <%StaceMcGate> Pat could be adjusting bond values
[3:04:58] <NitronStreams> P. E. E. Pumping Extra Experience
[3:05:00] <%StaceMcGate> or getting infinite gifts
[3:05:01] <Jnkolm> @mothmal talk to them at the bar
[3:05:02] <%StaceMcGate> to give them
[3:05:07] <watts121> @wruce__billis cheat engine
[3:05:11] <%wruce__billis> @mothmal just talk to them at Survive, you can give them romance items for bond level
[3:05:20] <wrydiculous> but adjusting bond values means no more dialogue
[3:05:46] <mothmal> alright thanks guys, guess i never did that..
[3:05:53] <+SilverInferno3> Quick q, does Pat know he has to give Kasuga the Enforcer job once to give him a new exploration skill?
[3:05:56] <fIashman92> So is he actually peeing? I can't tell anymore
[3:06:13] <+SilverInferno3> Because that's actually VITAL and the game doesn't even tell you IIRC
[3:06:15] <%PigGuy800> P. E. E. the peak of 2X4 technology
[3:06:23] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> he probably is peeing but probably cheating at the same time
[3:06:25] <fIashman92> @SilverInferno3 You mean foreman?
[3:06:27] <%QueequegTheater> INB4 everyone is level 40
[3:06:32] <%ek117> @fIashman92 he already has
[3:06:32] <watts121> since we're talking shit, is there any romance worth doing over the others?
[3:06:35] <%StaceMcGate> CHEATER
[3:06:38] <+SilverInferno3> Oh yeah sorry, meant Foreman

[3:10:54] <BleedinActionMan> What kind of tiny goblin man would break in through a doggy door?
[3:10:57] <%Dunmarkh> stick the gun through the doggy door like home alone
[3:11:02] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Only Young Elliot Page could possibly break in through the doggy door
[3:11:04] <heartlesshealer> ELMO MIGHT ESCAPE IF DOG DOOR

[3:46:37] <%sighphers> bartenders
[3:46:44] <%Blackleafx> like, a literal social phenomenon
[3:46:50] <+twohitgood> so arakawa faked ichiban's death
[3:47:04] <GManx0> Is Namba the next Hobo Chief
[3:47:04] <cardamomo88> so that's why kashiwagi is here?
[3:47:08] <%Birdigalore> I mean Arakawa was an assassin . If he wanted Ichi dead he would have nailed him in the head or heart
[3:47:19] <Sulfur_Boride> Faked Ichi's death by shooting him right where one of his lungs should probably be.

[3:48:28] <huskarl_zap> Saejima didnt get the message
[3:48:29] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Yeah, there's no way he could have actually been sure Ichiban would survive.
[3:48:30] <+Aggro_Will> Aha! Under Yakuza double jeopardy rules, they can't kill him TWICE!
[3:48:32] <+tigerfang86> yeah that would have been bad opticx

[3:49:20] <ItsZelus> LUL
[3:49:23] <UlriktheSlayer1> well damn
[3:49:25] <%TissueBoxDan> remember in zero where the power of friendship healed bullet wounds in 15 minues
[3:49:29] <+LandOfTheWay> remember when kiryu face-tanked millennium tower blowing up in 1?
[3:49:31] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Missed all the organs.
[3:49:31] <%goose_attack_almanac> he's not even cool
[3:49:32] <%reonome> its the chinese blood
[3:49:32] <BigShay93> flesh wound
[3:49:33] <+tigerfang86> he was a SECRET CHINESE heir though pat
[3:49:33] <xbb1024> that's probably needed to get Kyru's approval
[3:49:33] <TheHeroAppears> he got better
[3:49:34] <TyrianPurpleHaze> He drank a LOT of Staminans, Pat.
[3:49:35] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> after the tower, you get what you want
[3:49:38] <Remedy020> no vital organs just bled out? rooThink
[3:49:39] <%Dakuu75> nah, he's fine. jsut put some Neosporin on that shit.
[3:49:39] <+thefishofwar> healing factor
[3:49:40] <%PinionGear> thats so stupid
[3:49:42] <%MrCJBubba> Do you remember when Majima healed from a stab wound in less than 2 minutes and jumped out of a garbage can and beat up kiryu
[3:49:42] <%radda343> just a flesh wound
[3:49:43] <+rainlily1245> what about kashiwagi tho
[3:49:45] <redrins> it somehow managed to avoid any organs! ain't that amazing?
[3:49:46] <fIashman92> It was his secrete secret Chinese power
[3:49:48] <SirDogBear> of course, Shiro has many instances of literally lying to himself CorgiDerp
[3:49:49] <+swid_harry> crazy what a StaminaXX will do
[3:49:50] <huskarl_zap> Remember when kiryu killed those helicopters?
[3:49:51] <MildMannered_Creighton> rubber bullet knives
[3:49:52] <+Aggro_Will> In Yakuza, absolutely no wounds are fatal unless they're in a cutscene, and even then it's like maybe 20% of the time.
[3:49:53] <breakerdsx> Remember when Kiryu got shot in the chest in Yakuza 0 and then he took off his shirt with no damage at all
[3:49:53] <%jillpilled> A few burgers and staminan and he's good to go again
[3:49:54] <cheerthisdan> "It's fine tho it missed all of my vitals."
[3:49:56] <%Mendin> Man they did the Yakuza 0 guys dirty with how fast t hey died
[3:49:58] <%hoodedlefty> Arakawa did say it was going according to plan
[3:50:00] <%miguelrod777> he was given strength through dad powers
[3:50:00] <Remedy020> Flex Tape :)
[3:50:01] <+ianabstract> drank staminas and ate every item on a resturants menu

[3:50:38] <%furiousfurioso> naw its cool he had a sacrificial stone on him
[3:50:39] <Sulfur_Boride> Nanba said that the bullet was just a hair off of Ichi's heart. Arakawa was counting on not puncturing a heart or lung.
[3:50:40] <huskarl_zap> Oh no kung fu masters
[3:50:40] <h0wiewong> Oh my god, Idol Saeko with a rifle is hilarious

[3:53:06] <+Aggro_Will> It's a running theme in this game. People get SHOT, because they don't DUCK. It's symbolism!

[3:54:56] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @PatStaresAt You 100% called it when you said Arakawa was the protagonist of his own Yakuza game, because this is legit a Yakuza game in its own right
[3:55:38] <circular7> crafty
[3:55:44] <+taltalheights> Hungry hungry homeless, that's why
[3:55:46] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Arakawa was a really good theatre actor with a shit mom that ruined his life.... fun

[3:55:50] <%MelBrooksKA> I can't see them having you play as a hitman

[4:00:31] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @PatStaresAt So I guess we just learned the halfway point of the Yakuza game Arakawa was the protagonist of. The ending was punching open that locker to save his son.

[4:50:44] <$KaosMachina> or does it still turn into a rhythm game
[4:50:44] <mortificent> this coffee is actually is super expensive and violates animal rights really hard

[4:51:00] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt I meant the liu mung chinatown
[4:51:00] <+213372bu> game icons, and its in the middle of the map

[4:51:03] <+Mitchellsocks> I've heard Kopi Luak's kinda overrated

[4:51:11] <%Grimlockfly> you were in one as part of story
[4:51:12] <+byrtrael> 120 hours in and I've barely touched any of the repeat minigames
[4:51:12] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> When you Perfect a hostess club visit you get a goofy drunk bitch animation, that's it really
[4:51:14] <%coreyyotto> not chinatown, restaurant row
[4:51:14] <ItsZelus> they increase bond pretty highly, but its expensive
[4:51:15] <%goose_attack_almanac> Isezaki Road Pat

[4:51:28] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Lin Lin was that place you fought the guy with the armpit fetish
[4:51:28] <+GingerStrawhat> Just drop a whole lot of money there
[4:51:28] <%radda343> the chinatown one isn't open yet
[4:51:34] <%coreyyotto> Remember, there's the one where Saeko went undercover
[4:51:35] <+GingerStrawhat> That is the red light district
[4:51:35] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt if you spend full price, around 100k, you'll get 85 bond points
[4:51:36] <$KaosMachina> nice
[4:51:36] <MrCyan> There is no minigame, but it's labled minigame
[4:51:38] <%Jekado> the other one is the one where you fought armpit man

[4:51:46] <%hoodedlefty> I’ll stick with Matcha thx Chinese majima
[4:51:55] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> Its worth it to watch Namba happily stumble out of the club while they wave him drunkly
[4:51:55] <%Jekado> there is completion list for it
[4:51:58] <fIashman92> There's technically a minigame but it's dumb
[4:52:03] <ShichiNoBushi> The one labeled "Red Light District"?

[5:01:15] <+PR0swagonist> oh they fuggin
[5:01:17] <%NopeBadguy> why does everyone call han by his whole fucking name
[5:01:18] <%AzureGale> He was drinking with the REST OF THE PARTY, Ichiban
[5:01:21] <%NopeBadguy> like his full ass name
[5:01:33] <ricky12k1> Out of respect?
[5:01:34] <Ultimatefool> "Your hair is fucking crazy"
[5:01:35] <%promessav2> if you have one, just change it to 200
[5:01:40] <%krispen_wa> Ichiban, if our positions were switched....would I have your life...and you mine?
[5:01:41] <Remedy020> monkaS Assassins?
[5:01:53] <TyrianPurpleHaze> I feel like Han is trying VERY hard to not immediately become buddies with Ichiban and failing miserably.
[5:02:00] <%Psyramics> wait a minute, is this the Social Link bar? Is this where all the Social Links happen?
[5:02:07] <CrazyMedicine> Let's be friend with vergil

[5:03:27] <Remedy020> lmao
[5:03:29] <Ultimatefool> Why do they ALWAYS say his full name? It's never Han or Joon-Gi, it's JOON. GI. HAN.
[5:03:33] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Yeah... He's pretty much stuck with that face the rest of his life if he doesn't want to look like a monster.

[5:05:13] <%krispen_wa> One is not only optional, she's imaginary
[5:05:14] <GustauveVIII> my entire party for end game was without the first 3 party members
[5:05:16] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Zhao actually ends up with the highest Attack in the crew.
[5:05:22] <%JayCantDo> Zhao is super cool
[5:05:41] <CrypticMochi> Doesn’t Adachi do huge damage?

[5:06:54] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Ichiban: I'm trying REALLY HARD not to think you're a murderous cannibal, Zhao, but you're making it difficult.
[5:06:57] <%the22cstomp> ichiban emanates a lot of pheromones
[5:07:00] <+ZipperHands> Ichiban fucks
[5:07:00] <%wruce__billis> finish one of his romance plots dude
[5:07:01] <%baka_sugoi> Sex aura powerful
[5:07:02] <%st_jimmy456> he knows what sex is
[5:07:02] <%televisedrevolting> Ichiban fucks
[5:07:03] <KingVantq> Sex? what?
[5:07:03] <+rainlily1245> KappaPride
[5:07:03] <eco419> trueee
[5:07:04] <Remedy020> He's just attracts everyone
[5:07:06] <%televisedrevolting> *?
[5:07:06] <MarvelousMrD> he has permanent sex hair
[5:07:07] <+rickelstiltskin> its the jazz
[5:07:09] <%radda343> kiryu is horny, ichiban FUCKS
[5:07:09] <london_flexing> Cause you want to sex it
[5:07:12] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> @PatStaresAt Its the Hair
[5:07:15] <brachydios777> ZHAO HAS DEFINITELY KILLED PEOPLE
[5:07:16] <$Skelemungus> well ichiban actually had sex
[5:07:18] <%rdark_ksu> one of my guys did
[5:07:18] <ProfessorLuigi> Zhao never killed anyone
[5:07:19] <+vicar_anat> the harem hero we all needed
[5:07:19] <%Alazull> Kasuga is a charismatic dude in the more classic sense
[5:07:19] <+byrtrael> Kasuga was raised in sex so it makes sense
[5:07:20] <%krispen_wa> Kiryu doesn't know what sex is. Ichiban IS sex
[5:07:22] <%AzureGale> I didn't kill him... OR DID I!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?
[5:07:24] <+KennyKrool> ichiban has a wife so
[5:07:31] <+ZipperHands> Honestly this game is probably the most homoerotic in the series
[5:07:33] <Remedy020> +100 Charisma for Ichi rooSmug
[5:07:34] <%NopeBadguy> Ichiban is actually really outgoing whereas Kiryu tending to really close himself off
[5:07:35] <%Alazull> Like Kiryu is cool, but I'd actually hang out with Kasuga
[5:07:36] <NitronStreams> Ichiban's party is basically a friends with benefits club
[5:07:39] <deerlearning> V I B E C H E C K
[5:07:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> Kiryu was RST incarnate Ichiban is just naive to it
[5:07:54] <Sulfur_Boride> Is this what Ichiban in the beginning meant by being a "reverse chick magnet"?
[5:07:57] <%krispen_wa> KOREAN CHINESE
[5:08:02] <%baka_sugoi> V I B E
[5:08:03] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @PatStaresAt The big difference between Kiryu and Ichiban is that Ichiban does know what sex is, so the Sex Energy actually has a place to go.
[5:08:03] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> Ichiban would be a caring lover
[5:08:15] <randomahole> Kiryu is Jotaro, Ichiban is Joseph
[5:08:15] <%Grimlockfly> Zhao plays at Chinese Majima, but it's not his scene
[5:08:16] <+tigerfang86> Ichiban that WONT END WELL
[5:08:19] <%baka_sugoi> Ichi the BIG SPOON
[5:08:27] <%T_Sasquatch> Really enjoying zhaos va. It's very unique. Almost bored but trying to be smooth
[5:08:33] <%NopeBadguy> Sometimes I wonder if Kiryu's trauma like wrecked the man to a point of being unable to actually socialize
[5:08:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TyrianPurpleHaze he was over exposed to sex while a kid and thus doesn't see it as a thing anymore
[5:08:44] <%sighphers> zhao doesn't have that trauma to make him an ultra murderer-torturer
[5:08:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Sulfur_Boride I don't know, I think he's just better at ladies than he thinks he is.
[5:08:54] <%Dunmarkh> Just piss on the grave of the noble pimp
[5:09:02] <+RaveBV> lmao no
[5:09:02] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @doc_ock_rokc Oh wow, he really IS the Nega-Kiryu!
[5:09:08] <%krispen_wa> Kiryu held out for Yumi so hard that when it came time to fuck Kaoru it never got up
[5:09:14] <%Ynkubus_> @NopeBadguy certainly a valid way of seein git
[5:09:15] <h0wiewong> Man fuck Mabuchi
[5:09:16] <%Jaller101514> When did all this happen?
[5:09:21] <Remedy020> He killed soap land owner though....
[5:09:22] <%Alazull> It's a clink of glasses
[5:09:23] <+RaveBV> fuck mabuchi
[5:09:23] <HeroToxiko> You could almost call it a REBOOT; Stares at camera
[5:09:25] <%promessav2> he was the coolest guy
[5:09:27] <Ausk> he killed your boss
[5:09:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TyrianPurpleHaze raised in a whorehouse remember
[5:09:43] <Samuraiflame> pat is syncing his drinking to the characters
[5:09:47] <%AzureGale> Finally, we can advance Nanba's drink link
[5:09:50] <ProfessorLuigi> He says as he drinks
[5:09:51] <+eldrinos> reminder: ichi is DUMB.
[5:09:56] <%sadboimetztli> i forgot you were playing the dub and OH BOY that first line fucked me up
[5:09:57] <+natjen8> Ichiban is a himbo to the end
[5:10:00] <$Hzealot> remember when we bro fisted mabuchi over the boss corpse
[5:10:08] <missingangle> The bartender's like "I'm RIGHT HERE"
[5:10:11] <ProfessorLuigi> And that's the end
[5:10:22] <%sadboimetztli> SIMP
[5:10:24] <%Alazull> Covering for some young chick
[5:10:26] <nmaten> kashiwagi just staring off into the distance
[5:10:29] <olaksi> It was the being a drug patsy nanba
[5:10:33] <%krispen_wa> You went wrong when you decided to take the fall
[5:10:33] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> no, he killed your boss. Mabuchi's not going to be reformed or anything
[5:10:34] <%baka_sugoi> SIMPIN
[5:10:35] <+tigerfang86> "You're trash crew"
[5:10:38] <%krispen_wa> like literally you told us this

[5:22:56] <%Cozy90> Max looks like a broom
[5:22:59] <%Higure_yoru> Is that the name of the bar or a challange?
[5:23:03] <missingangle> Pat... has a dog. And a cat
[5:23:05] <%TheDullaMAN> TheDullaMAN subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[5:23:07] <%StreamingAniki> tbh i feel like Max's "gamer merch filled" background attracts more casual viewers at first glance, and thats a part of it
[5:23:09] <%thepizzascotsman> Pat you have the handsomest orb ive ever seen
[5:23:29] <%Brassnarwhal> big orb energy
[5:23:32] <eco419> Pat is Cool >·<
[5:23:35] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA DAIGO
[5:23:37] <Maleicus> so pat needs more gamer merch
[5:23:38] <Sulfur_Boride> Can our trash gang basically be considered the adult Phantom Thieves?
[5:23:38] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Would Max slather himself in peanut butter to let his dog eat it off him? No? Thats why Pat > Max
[5:23:45] <%goose_attack_almanac> Hey Pat I just wanna let you know that my cats favourite toy is water bottle caps and she is currently stuck inside a shoe trying to reach the one she dropped in there
[5:23:50] <+rsg220> pat is paul giamatti and tim curry rolled into one
[5:23:53] <%baka_sugoi> psaGib psaGib psaGib psaGib

[5:24:42] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Are you shocked Mabuchi got off scot-free.
[5:24:46] <%baka_sugoi> Teach elmo how to tech grabs
[5:24:47] <%Bt_Robot> EMLO HE SCREM
[5:24:50] <Sulfur_Boride> I love both of Zhao's voice, but I love how super nonchalant his JP sounds during battle.
[5:24:59] <%Brassnarwhal> H E N L O E M L O
[5:25:15] <%baka_sugoi> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[5:25:16] <%medusasghost> psaWink
[5:25:25] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @PatStaresAt So Zhao is basically if Majima never got to have a Kiryu or anyone else to fight with, so he's low-key super depressed.
[5:25:26] <%krispen_wa> Do they have separate lip syncing for each language? They sound super natural in english
[5:25:30] <%promessav2> pat, you just need hype alerts and maybe you'll be as cool as max "ULTRAAAAA COMBOOO"
[5:25:40] <MarvelousMrD> hes not as wacky as majima but still fun
[5:25:42] <+FleshFriend> Thanks for the 2020Gift @thedullaman
[5:25:43] <Sulfur_Boride> @krispen_wa Correct
[5:25:49] <randomahole> fuck, I miss going to bars, too. And I didn't even like it that much
[5:25:55] <%Brassnarwhal> psaWink

[5:26:11] <thebalticguy1> DA BABY
[5:26:15] <eco419> LuvSign
[5:26:17] <%Alazull> I can't wait to sit around bar having drinks with friends again
[5:26:22] <%StreamingAniki> Zhao is a FANTASTIC "majima ver 2" imo
[5:26:28] <KingVantq> rushing to chapter 12?
[5:26:29] <%baka_sugoi> THE BABY
[5:26:29] <%MonsterEnvy> 55 is end game level.
[5:26:30] <%SunnyVarietyPack> You still have to beat this chapter as well

[5:26:35] <%televisedrevolting> Wait get to it in this stream?
[5:26:35] <%Bt_Robot> MAKE SURE TO FINISH KILLING ALL THE CIRCUS ANIMALS
[5:26:35] <Blank9> they will tell you "this is the GRIND SPOT" in the main story when you get there
[5:26:42] <+KennyKrool> All I heard was mind goblins
[5:26:42] <%Monkeyweed21> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin

[5:26:48] <Maleicus> hes so happy
[5:26:49] <%JaydenSai> You have one or two more big battles, one or two more big talks, then it's grind time @PatStaresAt
[5:26:50] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> Why would you grind, Litterally every fight you do has been a cake walk
[5:26:50] <KingFatality> HE'S HUMMING BAKA MITAI
[5:26:52] <Sulfur_Boride> Oh boy. Nanba's next chapter
[5:26:52] <+rsg220> are there difficulty settings for this game?
[5:26:53] <ProfessorLuigi> Is he humming Baka Mitai to himself?
[5:26:54] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[5:26:55] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @VritraReiRei The grind spot's in Kamurocho, in the next hcapter
[5:26:57] <%JeanGardner99> Pat actually has gas still in the tank?
[5:26:57] <%televisedrevolting> That's kinda far from this spot in the story.
[5:26:57] <eco419> dame dane
[5:26:57] <colzack_> Nanba humming Baka Mitai
[5:27:01] <$Skelemungus> he cant wait for that pie

[5:27:13] <%StreamingAniki> im trapped in the grind in Hard mode right now and it suuuuucks
[5:27:17] <%JeanGardner99> seems fair
[5:27:18] <%krispen_wa> Pat is gonna grind to 99 and bully Amon
[5:27:19] <colzack_> Around an hour and a half yeah
[5:27:21] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt you just started chapter 11 Pat, there is alot left
[5:27:21] <%SunnyVarietyPack> If you play the chapter yes
[5:27:21] <circular7> :(
[5:27:23] <%BoxNavy> 4 hours
[5:27:23] <MasterTonberry23> @Tinypidgenofdoom and if he grinds it will stay that way!
[5:27:23] <%StreamingAniki> you're pretty close
[5:27:23] <TyrianPurpleHaze> ICHIBAN YOU PLAN A SURPRISE PARTY FOR NANBA RIGHT NOW!
[5:27:24] <colzack_> if you focus story
[5:27:25] <KingFatality> you need to get to the next chapter
[5:27:25] <+xeros720> i just unlocked what i think you're talking about
[5:27:26] <%televisedrevolting> It's a chapter or two from here.
[5:27:30] <%Cozy90> 3 hours
[5:27:31] <%goose_attack_almanac> However long it takes to Max S Links
[5:27:31] <%JaydenSai> Hour and half to two @PatStaresAt
[5:27:32] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> if you focus on the story part
[5:27:34] <MarvelousMrD> thats not a lot ichiban
[5:27:41] <+xeros720> huh, oh i think i know what you guys mean
[5:27:41] <thebalticguy1> SNAKE
[5:27:41] <circular7> give him his party dammit
[5:27:42] <colzack_> Yeah this chapter is kinda long
[5:27:43] <FoolproofDread> he's not lying.
[5:27:45] <@StridentSong> It's like Chapter 14 if you're talking about the next Dungeon
[5:27:48] <TyrianPurpleHaze> It's at least an hour from the grind spot, honestly.
[5:27:49] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> @MasterTonberry23 Wheres the fun in no challenge
[5:27:49] <%T_Sasquatch> Ahhh grinding. Why i don't like tbrpgs ...
[5:27:50] <AwkwardSenpai> Man Snake sounds mad
[5:27:53] <%JeanGardner99> oh wait it is a bit away
[5:27:53] <%NopeBadguy> Bro, it's so uncanny hearing David Hayter without gurgling gravel
[5:27:55] <$Skelemungus> you gotta blast through the story first
[5:27:56] <%krispen_wa> Just plan the party you fucks
[5:27:57] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[5:27:58] <TyrianPurpleHaze> This is a long-ass stretch of story coming up.
[5:27:59] <%reknownblackcat> is that david hayter?
[5:28:01] <%krispen_wa> Mizue doesn't matter
[5:28:01] <Hellarussian> ominous music
[5:28:08] <overlordloki> probably sleep
[5:28:08] <%baka_sugoi> klepto
[5:28:08] <colzack_> The next grinding area is chapter 12
[5:28:08] <%SunnyVarietyPack> No! It’s chapter 12
[5:28:09] <%televisedrevolting> The grind spot is in 12 though.
[5:28:09] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt chapter 12 is the battle arena, and Chapter 15 is the final dungeon
[5:28:09] <%Garthunox> no its chapter 12
[5:28:09] <Sulfur_Boride> Futaba steals? No dignity
[5:28:11] <thebalticguy1> The grind spot is not a dungeon tho
[5:28:12] <+tetraes> it is
[5:28:13] <Zbyrd0961> i thought it was 12?
[5:28:13] <UltimateDomon> it sure is
[5:28:14] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Chapter 12 for farming
[5:28:15] <KingVantq> yeah i found a grind thing in 12
[5:28:15] <@StridentSong> Is there a dungeon in 12?
[5:28:15] <MasterTonberry23> yes the bartender is david hayter
[5:28:15] <%Garthunox> yeah its chapter 12
[5:28:16] <h0wiewong> 12 is the grind spot
[5:28:17] <Dr00_PhD> We're not talking about the next dungeon though
[5:28:17] <%HedgehogGames1> The grind spot is chapter 12
[5:28:18] <%AzureGale> @reknownblackcat Yes
[5:28:19] <%SunnyVarietyPack> It’s definitely chapter 12
[5:28:19] <+byrtrael> No Chapter 12 is grind time
[5:28:19] <WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> Your coming up to a really story heavy part
[5:28:20] <thebalticguy1> Chapter 12 has a grind spot
[5:28:22] <%JeanGardner99> Battle Arena is a good grind spot
[5:28:23] <%Mantorok06> 12 then 14
[5:28:24] <%QueequegTheater> 12
[5:28:25] <%StreamingAniki> battle arena is BIG GRIND spot
[5:28:25] <%televisedrevolting> 12 is the grind spot.
[5:28:26] <%NopeBadguy> Chapter 12 is the battle arena
[5:28:27] <saddest_man> chapter 12
[5:28:28] <%Garthunox> the battle arena is the grind spot!
[5:28:28] <AwkwardSenpai> Chapter 12 has a hard boss fight, so does 14.
[5:28:32] <thebalticguy1> Chapter 12 = big grind
[5:28:32] <%Nekros4442> 12 is the grind spot
[5:28:33] <Brunty023> Chapter 12 is the Wall
[5:28:36] <%goose_attack_almanac> still good exp
[5:28:37] <Blank9> dungeon's not necessarily the best grind spot, battle arena works faster overall
[5:28:41] <%reknownblackcat> my Hayter boner is growing hard in the battlefield
[5:28:41] <%Mr_Pylon> Big grind in 12, other potential grind in 14
[5:28:42] <+zanzibar_junker> the arena also has upgrade materials
[5:28:44] <NitronStreams> I like how He has just a little gravel on some words. it makes the character feel just a little bit darker
[5:28:44] <%darkheroxiii> The battle arena gets you easy rare materials
[5:28:45] <%televisedrevolting> Battle Arena is good for grind.
[5:28:47] <@StridentSong> I wouldn't say the Battle Arena is a grind spot all that much. 14 has the next dungeon with Invested Vagrants
[5:28:47] <%JeanGardner99> Battle Arena can make the next optional dungeon obsolete if you grind too hard
[5:28:47] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @PatStaresAt Chapter 12 is the grind spot, but you're still at least an hour or two from there.
[5:28:49] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> The Arena gives the best upgrades itens and the best gear
[5:28:51] <%Jekado> 12 has the arena which is the next good grind spot, i also used the yakuza gear to even everyones levels out i blame pat for that.
[5:28:54] <%BoxNavy> WutFace
[5:28:56] <%baka_sugoi> KOF POCHINKO
[5:28:59] <ateeeeez> yahkeeneekou?
[5:29:01] <%VHGS> @Blank9 if you're just doing metal slimes dungeon is way faster than arena
[5:29:04] <%krispen_wa> JACKPOT
[5:29:04] <$Skelemungus> the second to last dungeon one is way better than the battle arena however
[5:29:07] <%HedgehogGames1> Chapter 12 gives you the battle arena, looks deep into your eyes, and says go fucking grind.
[5:29:09] <ProfessorLuigi> Ooh, money collections
[5:29:10] <%StreamingAniki> I thought I was overlevelled for chapter 12's boss fight and I almost got my ASS KICKED. They want you to big grind in chapter 12
[5:29:11] <@StridentSong> But yea you're like an 1 1/2-2 hours from Battle Arena
[5:29:12] <%Cozy90> PUNCH HER
[5:29:16] <%NopeBadguy> @StridentSong That's 15.
[5:29:16] <Where_U_Bin_Laden> I'll KILL YOU

[5:48:46] <@SoFarFetched> "First you were Joon-Gi Han,now you will be Joon-Be GONE"
[5:48:52] <%chexmixisbest> joon-gi han was pretty cool
[5:48:58] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @PatStaresAt The last part of each romance is a substory, BTW, so you should save that last bit for the stream.
[5:49:03] <CelestialCage> This guy just needs to level up
[5:49:06] <theyseemerowling> talk dirty to me
[5:49:08] <%AtlasMcCoy> VERGIL?

[5:49:10] <%weissguard> @SoFarFetched That doesn't even rhyme! Kappa
[5:49:19] <%baka_sugoi> DANTE
[5:49:19] <NeroInfinite> Yeonsu Kim
[5:49:22] <Sulfur_Boride> @PatStaresAt So in case you missed what I said, in the Yakuza gacha game, there's a substory involving Ryuji Goda and another man named Joon Gi Han. "Joon Gi Han" seems to be a moniker that's passed down.
[5:49:26] <+vicar_anat> now the sex can begin
[5:49:31] <%NopeBadguy> By Beat Takeshi yeah
[5:49:31] <ghostkingwho> so if you never do this drink link, you'd never find out why joon-gi han is "alive" again?
[5:49:31] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Yeon-su Kim? Not a bad name.
[5:49:32] <brachydios777> The only reason Joon-Gi Han lost fights is because he fought Kiryu
[5:49:36] <+tigerfang86> Vergil....
[5:49:38] <redrins> joongi han died for mk2
[5:49:42] <@SoFarFetched> psaDab
[5:49:43] <%krispen_wa> A bullet to the head? Just a flesh wound
[5:49:46] <NitronStreams> Yeonsu Kim will now DIE for you
[5:49:48] <mortificent> DAMN YOU BEAT TAKESHIIII
[5:49:51] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @ghostkingwho They mentioned it in passing in the main story.
[5:49:53] <PageofHeart> The baby
[5:49:56] <CelestialCage> He beat the ass of a guy who could also put a decent fight against Kiryu
[5:50:02] <%MikeTD81> Yes he was shot by actor and co.edian Beat Takeshi
[5:50:07] <Sulfur_Boride> Korean Vergil died, but does the Yamato Mark 2 live on?
[5:50:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nice, just got back from work and you're still streaming.
[5:50:14] <%SirGO0SE> joon-gi was probably the baddest boy since majima
[5:50:22] <gutterfeast> The game should let us kiss Korean Vergil with tongue
[5:50:31] <ghostkingwho> @TyrianPurpleHaze ah got it, thanks
[5:50:32] <%televisedrevolting> @sulfur_boride Fuck no. That shit is either hidden or disassembled.
[5:50:56] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Yeah though, I love that Ichiban is actually able to just go "Man, fuck that Yakuza shit, I ain't going back to that after 18 years in prison" unlike Kiryu.
[5:51:01] <%baka_sugoi> bummer
[5:51:06] <+jt427> i hope zhao and joon smooch alot
[5:51:08] <%SilvaChariot0133> "Hey Japan? Whatcha' got there?"
[5:51:14] <Sulfur_Boride> I honestly want someone to mod this game and replace all of English Han's lines with Vergil's, and have him say Jackpot for his gun attacks
[5:51:15] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> This guy's cool
[5:51:19] <mortificent> @sulfur_boride hell no, that was a public war crime in display
[5:51:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Joon is the second best party member. He never left my party.
[5:51:41] <%Monkeyweed21> thats a Key and Peele sjetch
[5:52:15] <%Mantorok06> My party to the end was Eri, Joon-gi, and Saeko
[5:52:28] <%krispen_wa> Fuck you Beat Takeshi
[5:52:30] <soutakuphi> thanks kiryu
[5:52:41] <TyrianPurpleHaze> "Unfortunately, Yakuza 6 was already over by the time I learned about it."
[5:52:42] <ItsZelus> Beat Takeshi PogChamp
[5:52:48] <PageofHeart> Damn Beat Takeshi
[5:52:49] <Sulfur_Boride> By the time I learned of Beat Takeshi and his movies, he was dead
[5:52:52] <%krispen_wa> "A sister"
[5:52:53] <CelestialCage> @soutakuphi Dunno what ya mean. Kiryu never killed anyone :)
[5:52:55] <%baka_sugoi> Onee-San
[5:52:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He wants to fuck his sis tho
[5:52:57] <soutakuphi> beatt takeshi personally killed him
[5:53:02] <%nobleclonetrooper> How does no one know Kiryu was involved? The guy's infamous!
[5:53:03] <%chexmixisbest> joon-gi has some of the best main story beats regarding his being a body double

[6:14:30] <wrydiculous> SUBTLE
[6:14:30] <%StaceMcGate> High Key Racism was Yakuza 6
[6:14:33] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> The HIGH key racism is PRETTY HIGH UP THERE
[6:14:34] <%HedgehogGames1> 'Low' key?
[6:14:34] <xbb1024> a G#
[6:14:34] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> lol have you met Japan?
[6:14:39] <%miguelrod777> lower key than secret koreans being the root of all problems
[6:14:40] <TyrianPurpleHaze> The highkey racism was stuff like the "Secret Chinese" plotline in Yakuza 6
[6:14:43] <pi_in_the_sci> It isn't your racism, so it's easy to miss
[6:14:44] <%penitentpendant> More implied than explicit
[6:14:44] <%promessav2> nah they had a normal japnese voice
[6:14:45] <heartlesshealer> "filthy mainlanders"
[6:14:48] <%linSP> i mean cmon its japan
[6:14:49] <%rdark_ksu> What about when they said Ya know I thought all Chinese were murderes but I was wrong
[6:14:50] <%krispen_wa> SECRET CHINESE
[6:14:51] <KingVantq> @ateeeeez bond xp
[6:14:53] <thebalticguy1> Remember they had to change Lao Gui's face because he was too racist
[6:14:54] <ShichiNoBushi> Mid-key?
[6:14:54] <%AzureGale> Wowowowowowowowowowowowoowow
[6:14:55] <fIashman92> I just don't see myself dating a black guy
[6:14:57] <Sulfur_Boride> As Kiryu assuming a dude was a Triad member b/c he was Chinese?
[6:14:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> oof
[6:14:58] <%barrakuta371> Wow i forgot about that
[6:14:59] <%BoxNavy> JEEZ
[6:15:03] <%Hotironclad> When was that?
[6:15:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I GUESS it's not all of you.
[6:15:04] <Sulfur_Boride> Or terrorist...
[6:15:06] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Yeah that was some big oof.
[6:15:12] <%Cozy90> wow
[6:15:13] <brachydios777> Jeez Kiryu!
[6:15:13] <%penitentpendant> GRANDPA KIRYU NO!
[6:15:19] <%BoxNavy> i dunno about this kiryu guy anymore
[6:15:19] <CelestialCage> Gonna need to put Kiryu in a home soon... with colosseum battles
[6:15:23] <tattleworm> kiryu never racially profiled anyone
[6:15:24] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> That english guy asking for directions is endearing racism
[6:15:26] <%YakumoYomi> I thought Japan was more "xenophobic" (as in "Japanese vs. non-Japanese")
[6:15:28] <%krispen_wa> Yakuza 6's main story was all sorts of YIKES
[6:15:33] <%rdark_ksu> secret koreans
[6:15:33] <thebalticguy1> THEJINGWEON
[6:15:33] <%gnarly_memes_bro> yakuza 2 Koreans may as well be Wendigos
[6:15:35] <+RaveBV> Man, fuck mabuchi
[6:15:35] <@SSaryn> To be fair, the one Lau Ka Lang was a huge murderer.
[6:15:37] <snoozeaholic> Kiryu would do good in Sleeping Dogs
[6:15:49] <thebalticguy1> The leader of thetojoclan was a secret korean
[6:16:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Zhao is my favorite party member.
[6:16:04] <+rainlily1245> @YakumoYomi Nah, Japan's got very particular racism towards different groups, especially Chinese and Koreans
[6:16:09] <brachydios777> Or Romulans
[6:16:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Especially in the English dub.
[6:16:11] <CelestialCage> @SSaryn you trying to say Kiryu was traumatized by being tortured by the triads?
[6:16:15] <%AzureGale> Man, this dialogue is weirdly applicable
[6:16:35] <CelestialCage> or thats probably just me coming to my own conclusions
[6:16:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I mean Ichiban didn't go far.
[6:16:39] <%krispen_wa> Japan and China have the absoltue WORST history with each other
[6:16:39] <mortificent> Also Japan got that exported racism because of the American occupation post war
[6:16:46] <%gnarly_memes_bro> ROCK BOTTOM
[6:16:51] <%BoxNavy> jermaPluto
[6:16:53] <%Garthunox> The Rock Bottom Dragon!
[6:16:54] <heartlesshealer> China's tried to invade japan multiple times, so that hasn't helped things over the centuries =T
[6:16:54] <Jnkolm> wasn't Ichiban just some grunt?
[6:16:54] <+PenGia> ICHI-BAD
[6:16:56] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @PatStaresAt "Even farther than you" he says to the low-rank errand boy for a third-rate family.
[6:16:58] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp Rock Bottom
[6:17:00] <CelestialCage> Bottom Ichiban
[6:17:00] <heartlesshealer> still super racist
[6:17:06] <%Rain_Mage> Ichiban is literally Luffy
[6:17:08] <Louie_Salmon> Humility?
[6:17:10] <Sulfur_Boride> Isn't Ichi's nickname The "Dragon of Rock Bottom"?
[6:17:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Jnkolm Yup. He ran collections.
[6:17:23] <%StaceMcGate> @heartlesshealer you got that backwards chief
[6:17:25] <%AzureGale> No one man should have all that power
[6:17:26] <+chiazam> Haha I guess so
[6:17:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Garthunox its a good tital
[6:17:31] <%StaceMcGate> Japan occupied China
[6:17:37] <TyrianPurpleHaze> "Yeah, I guess I am the whole reason that fucker tried to kill me."
[6:17:37] <%NopeBadguy> I know Zhao's putting up a front, but he's so good at it I legit thought he was high for a moment
[6:17:38] <brachydios777> LUL
[6:17:42] <FoolproofDread> hot
[6:17:46] <%krispen_wa> Nah, he's talking Pre-WWII
[6:17:49] <%krispen_wa> like ancient times
[6:18:01] <heartlesshealer> @StaceMcGate Oh, it was both ways? What set of years should I look up? :0c
[6:18:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Zhao's an extremely gifted and unmotivated guy.
[6:18:12] <%StaceMcGate> even pre-war, it was Japan invading its neighbors Korea and China
[6:18:15] <%StaceMcGate> multiple times
[6:18:18] <heartlesshealer> I meant pre-aerial bombing, yeah
[6:18:30] <fIashman92> Wait, same age?
[6:18:35] <heartlesshealer> I'll have to check that out
[6:18:41] <mortificent> Japan did do a lot of war crimes to the Chinese and Koreans, that they still don't teach at their schools
[6:18:50] <heartlesshealer> thanks @StaceMcGate
[6:18:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Zhao is in his 30s yeah.
[6:18:57] <CelestialCage> Having played Yakuza 0 I just know that half-chinese and half-japanese Tachibana and Makoto was hated by both races
[6:19:01] <HeroToxiko> naruto
[6:19:04] <+rainlily1245> Russo-Japanese War, both Japanese Invasions of Korea, etc. Closest Chinese did was invade when they were ruled by the Mongols.
[6:19:15] <artsupplies> being a chinese fan of these games sucks
[6:19:30] <TyrianPurpleHaze> So Zhao's actually a really good boss for a crime lord.
[6:19:40] <+tigerfang86> he's pretty insane
[6:19:45] <%BoxNavy> a fockin weirdo
[6:19:46] <jkfd> google "comfort women" for an explanation of why japan doesn't have the best of reputations among koreans and chinese either
[6:19:47] <%gnarly_memes_bro> oooo that must feel really odd, like they don't even want you playing the game at times
[6:19:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Zhao isn't suited to being a crime lord really. But he played the part well.
[6:20:00] <+tigerfang86> Zhao is legitimately chinese majima, he's even not really that wild
[6:20:02] <%krispen_wa> You thought of the big murder man as a brother?
[6:20:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I mean, Zhao is a murderer too.
[6:20:37] <%AtlasMcCoy> SMASH
[6:20:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Zhao and Han are both killers.
[6:20:47] <+PenGia> I was calling Zhao Great Value Majima when he first showed up but he's fairly chill
[6:20:49] <gutterfeast> KISS
[6:20:50] <Hellarussian> when keeping it real goes wrong
[6:20:52] <mortificent> @krispen_wa I'm sure Kiryu still thinks of Nishikiyama as his brother after all the murders
[6:20:52] <%eyezehuhh> KISS
[6:20:52] <%AzureGale> For keepin' it real!
[6:20:52] <+rainlily1245> Yakuza as a series tends to have a glaring flaw in how it portrays organized crime as being pure and innocent
[6:20:52] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Ichiban is totally gonna smash that.
[6:20:52] <+rsg220> just drinking with my bros
[6:20:56] <+jt427> cut to next game when keepin it real goes wrong
[6:20:57] <+pkmamsters> Zhao keeps it real, that's why he wears the cool glasses
[6:20:59] <%krispen_wa> Does Ichiban kill people canonically?
[6:21:02] <GManx0> Just kiss alredy
[6:21:03] <%Lone_Xeno> !uptime
[6:21:04] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 6h 21m.
[6:21:05] <CrmznOgre> this dudes gonna die real bad i bet
[6:21:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> No
[6:21:09] <seaechiowai> HSWP
[6:21:09] <%NopeBadguy> Thanks for streaming!
[6:21:10] <UlriktheSlayer1> ok
[6:21:14] <thebalticguy1> rip grind
[6:21:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Ichiban and Kiryu have never killed anyone canonically.
[6:21:16] <%BoxNavy> whooooa its almost 1:30
[6:21:19] <+pkmamsters> Seeeegaaaa
[6:21:22] <heartlesshealer> Thanks for hosting, Pat
[6:21:23] <ricky12k1> @krispen_wa in a way he is a alternative kiryu.
[6:21:23] <%NopeBadguy> OH NO THE SEGA LOGO FLASHBANG
[6:21:23] <@SoFarFetched> yeah cutscenes take a long time
[6:21:24] <saddest_man> And they all died
[6:21:24] <Sulfur_Boride> Welp, thanks for the stream, Pat

[6:21:37] <%Cozy90> GOOD GAME
[6:21:39] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @rainlily1245 if being yakuza was a crime it wouldn't be my destiny!!!
[6:21:41] <%Monkeyweed21> Any plans to check out the new Total Warhammer DLC?
[6:21:45] <%chibicheezit> this was fun!! can't wait for the next!!
[6:21:47] <ricky12k1> Alright goin bed thanks pat and all you guys.
[6:21:47] <fIashman92> So was monkey quest better than roomba quest?
[6:21:48] <%medusasghost> this was fun thanks pat
[6:21:53] <%BoxNavy> what
[6:21:55] <+chiazam> What even is on Saturday?
[6:21:58] <%krispen_wa> So he's anti-Kiryu in everything except not wanting to commit big murder
[6:22:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Sojimaru is the best quest.
[6:22:03] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Have a good rest Pat.
[6:22:07] <%Cozy90> whats saturday?
[6:22:08] <@SSaryn> I can't believe Pat is gonna shit his ass AND get shot.
[6:22:13] <mortificent> Thanks for the stream paaat
[6:22:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Except maybe the sidestory that finishes off the romance subplots.
[6:22:13] <%weissguard> lol, I guess I was super blind. My b
[6:22:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That one is great.
[6:22:17] <%Dunmarkh> @weissguard look at the schedule?
[6:22:21] <heartlesshealer> It's not saturday on earth yet
[6:22:24] <fIashman92> Sojimaru was the dumbest and I love it
[6:22:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> He has a stream scheduled for tomorrow. Only one that was bumped was Tuesday
[6:22:42] <%krispen_wa> Sojimaru's song still rings in my head today
[6:22:51] <@SoFarFetched> @Dunmarkh it doesn't say what game on the schedule cause it pretty much says "lol I'll figure it out"
[6:22:56] <@SoFarFetched> for Saturday
[6:23:15] <%gnarly_memes_bro> gnight guys, I still eagerly await chapter 13
[6:23:25] <@SoFarFetched> unless pat actually picked a game LUL
[6:23:29] <@SoFarFetched> or just stuck with more Yakuza 7
[6:23:40] <%krispen_wa> Welp, goodnight guys. I gotta go grind out the last 10 clears of Seat of Sacrifice EX to get my mount
[6:24:05] <heartlesshealer> good luck and good rest
[6:24:06] <Guardiansaiyan> is just happy the FRIENDSHIP BRIGADE is finally complete and they can all hug it out after a good day
[6:24:11] <@SSaryn> Ye
[6:24:15] <%BoxNavy> yo
[6:24:20] <%BoxNavy> what the heck is that
[6:24:28] <+dante_must_die_exe> LUL
[6:24:29] <heartlesshealer> ?
[6:24:33] <%Farples> Apparently P5 Strikers has been confirmed for the west
[6:24:38] <%Daxalog> Wow
[6:24:42] <%Farples> Again
[6:24:43] <@SSaryn> To be fair most of the games that come out from EGS do that.
[6:24:47] <digaogrunge> its also bad
[6:24:47] <heartlesshealer> oh
[6:24:48] <DianaTheAscian> what game?
[6:24:56] <%BoxNavy> @Farples the trailer dropped early by accident ;)
[6:25:01] <KarionIrsig> ''remember when we fallback on our steam keys and went to shill epic?? ha ha good times''
[6:25:03] <%Daxalog> Phoenix Point was made to be like the old old game. ANd...it had problems
[6:25:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> FUCK YOU
[6:25:11] <%SilvaChariot0133> NotlikeThis
[6:25:17] <%barrakuta371> Project Wingman also came out this week too! It's real good
[6:25:20] <+dante_must_die_exe> i didn't touch it either LUL
[6:25:21] <KingVantq> thats what the EGS does
[6:25:24] <+Ominnous> The 90s X-com games, not the 2000s
[6:25:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> Phoenix Point doesn't deserve a sale
[6:25:27] <heartlesshealer> bridge incinerated
[6:25:30] <%SvenHolgersson> Which game is this now
[6:25:34] <@SSaryn> At a Very Positive apparently with 59 reviews.
[6:25:36] <%Daxalog> Its been getting updates.
[6:25:36] <+CapnClassix> @PatStaresAt You gonna stream it?
[6:25:43] <%BoxNavy> is this going to be our saturday game?
[6:25:51] <%Daxalog> Its gonna get to Mixed review soon.
[6:26:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> Epic Game Exclusives deserve to die
[6:26:02] <@SSaryn> I'll be interested when more reviews come out for it on Steam.
[6:26:03] <Maleicus> whats 50% off
[6:26:13] <%BoxNavy> boooooo egs BabyRage
[6:26:18] <Sol_Install> give it a week
[6:26:18] <+dante_must_die_exe> it's not "bad"
[6:26:23] <%MajorCrasher> The game was pretty terrible from what I remember
[6:26:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I mean it's probably overly complicated like OG XCOM is.
[6:26:34] <Sol_Install> it's not bad but not great either
[6:26:35] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Some of them are but the ones who really don't like it say to buy Xcom-2 cause its just a worse version of that
[6:26:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its not bad but from what I heard its not great ether
[6:26:36] <digaogrunge> The first person targeting and cover systems in PP are busted
[6:26:37] <KingVantq> doesnt Xcom 2 run like shit?
[6:26:40] <championofsomeone> just got back what are we talking about chat
[6:26:44] <heartlesshealer> @Maleicus Phoenix Point if it's spelled like the bird
[6:26:46] <%MajorCrasher> it's like they copied modern xcom and made it worse for some reason
[6:27:00] <Maleicus> ahh
[6:27:06] <%owazowski> I fucking love XCOM 2 but yeah sometimes it's godawful
[6:27:12] <@SSaryn> I would just want to play original Xcom at that point honestly
[6:27:16] <Virokwet> yea
[6:27:27] <%AtlasMcCoy> WHEN XCOM 3
[6:27:31] <KingVantq> even the power of a 3090 cant run xcom 2 fully LUL
[6:27:32] <@SSaryn> Well, Xcom Enemy Unknown.
[6:27:37] <heartlesshealer> god I forgot about chimera
[6:27:40] <digaogrunge> I played Chimera, np. That game is great
[6:27:40] <viciousgrim> Phoenix Point is a ok game. it just does not grab you like the xcom games
[6:27:43] <%SirGO0SE> stream more xcom imo
[6:27:57] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Tactical breach wizards will eventually come out of beta I guess
[6:28:09] <%AtlasMcCoy> Yakuza 2077
[6:28:10] <%BoxNavy> no :)
[6:28:20] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt what about a Yakuza Game where they went into the past?
[6:28:20] <DianaTheAscian> no
[6:28:24] <heartlesshealer> yakuza depends on current year ad revenue
[6:28:30] <%Ynkubus_> Just wait for yakuza sequels to get there in real time
[6:28:34] <Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt like Time Travel?
[6:28:35] <heartlesshealer> due to city recreation
[6:28:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> Imagine a game like XCOM with time-travel affecting the tactical world map stuff
[6:28:45] <DianaTheAscian> @Guardiansaiyan u mean 0?
[6:28:52] <%Alazull> Stream Eden
[6:29:00] <@SoFarFetched> I figured
[6:29:04] <%Farples> I took the day off for it woolieCHAN
[6:29:09] <@SoFarFetched> just keep grinding off screen
[6:29:12] <KingVantq> Yakuza all week PogChamp
[6:29:15] <%linSP> bruh shenmue is 66% off PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[6:29:20] <%BoxNavy> jermaVenus
[6:29:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Just do 2 10 hour streams Pat.
[6:29:27] <Guardiansaiyan> @DianaTheAscian I mean Ichiban Time Travels to yakuza 1 or something
[6:29:28] <%Farples> @PatStaresAt I came in late, what chapter did you get to?
[6:29:33] <@SoFarFetched> yeah ssaryn and strident can probably give you a good estimate
[6:29:34] <@SSaryn> I did say 20-30 hours to be fair. If you went hard at it next week, you definitely could.
[6:29:44] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Pat will you stream Shemue 3 after this? psaSmug
[6:29:54] <%luckysteak> does it come out? really?
[6:29:54] <%SvenHolgersson> DOES IT THOUGH
[6:29:55] <@SSaryn> Which is why, like ehhhh
[6:29:57] <@SSaryn> Fair enough
[6:30:00] <%SvenHolgersson> OR IS THERE ANOTHER DELAY
[6:30:02] <DianaTheAscian> @Guardiansaiyan yeah no
[6:30:04] <%Alazull> Counterargument!
[6:30:04] <%BoxNavy> ah screw cyberpunk
[6:30:05] <heartlesshealer> don't make pat play a shenmue
[6:30:14] <+DrFacilier> i cant wait to see the shitstorm when Last of Us 2 gets goty
[6:30:15] <%coreyyotto> if you beeline it and only do story stuff, you can knock out chapter 11 and 12 next stream. Then each chapter after that could be a whole stream on its own
[6:30:16] <UlriktheSlayer1> they cant delay by now nonway
[6:30:16] <%Farples> psaBig WRONG
[6:30:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> NANBA DID NOTHING WRONG
[6:30:23] <%miguelrod777> forgot when it releases lmao
[6:30:25] <DianaTheAscian> i wonder i should get cyberpunk day one
[6:30:27] <@SSaryn> Still love Nanba but yeah like, he still kinda shit it up
[6:30:30] <DianaTheAscian> if*
[6:30:36] <Guardiansaiyan> @DianaTheAscian barlSad
[6:30:38] <%SvenHolgersson> NANBA IS A CUTIE PATOOTIE
[6:30:42] <viciousgrim> game awards okuri1Potate
[6:31:42] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[6:32:01] <heartlesshealer> phone wants to nap >:
[6:32:22] <%cvp5127> what if cyberpunk is boring?
[6:32:24] <KingVantq> @PatStaresAt turning off the nudity right?
[6:32:26] <@SSaryn> I hope it's not big bad and if not I'll pick it up a few days later.
[6:32:26] <%SirGO0SE> get that mute button hotkey ready
[6:32:29] <%Farples> I think you could finish yakuzies in about 4-5 streams
[6:32:30] <%JeanGardner99> Kinda on the fence of buying it myself
[6:32:34] <heartlesshealer> be careful streaming withthose Genital Options
[6:32:38] <%Alazull> That sucks?
[6:32:38] <%SvenHolgersson> That would be the worst outcome
[6:32:46] <HeroToxiko> @cvp5127 it obviously will be lol
[6:32:47] <%SvenHolgersson> Not that its buggy or broken
[6:32:48] <%Farples> I haven't hit the end myself but I'm in the last chapter
[6:32:49] <%SvenHolgersson> But boring
[6:32:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> The worst Cyberpunk could be is a 5/10
[6:32:52] <%BoxNavy> give cyberpunk a juicy week just to see if you like it ?
[6:32:54] <DianaTheAscian> if the game sucks then oh well i'll live
[6:32:54] <%Farples> 5 hours
[6:32:56] <UlriktheSlayer1> as much as id watch cyberpunk ill be playing it sooooo might no show up
[6:32:56] <%Farples> Depends on grind
[6:32:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> What if Cyberpunk launches and it's fun but it's HORRIBLY broken?
[6:32:59] <@SoFarFetched> 5-6 hours maybe
[6:32:59] <%StaceMcGate> You could finish in about 4 streams of 5 hours
[6:33:03] <%JeanGardner99> reviews come out yet for it?
[6:33:05] <marvel877> If its boring, then at least Pat's character will have a big dick.
[6:33:05] <%miguelrod777> I'll buy it when it's on sale in a couple of months
