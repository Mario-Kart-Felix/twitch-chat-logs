[0:34:15] <Vashido22> because there's A LOT MORE dialogue

[0:34:21] <%Saltmeisterr> Wait a bit pat

[0:34:21] <primaryfire> I don't remember the gender being an option when I played
[0:34:23] <Picia000123> It's an actual dialect too
[0:34:24] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> There are voiced lines, eventually

[0:43:15] <%Parapattern> GRASP IT FIRMLY
[0:43:15] <Tisaric> I fucking love that you can see literally every mechanic in Hades if you play the old games
[0:43:16] <CappuccinoGuil> GENTLY GRASP IT
[0:43:16] <%Regigangster> Grasp my orbs
[0:43:17] <Gutsandlove> the commentator is great
[0:43:18] <primaryfire> @mark1247 just because one guy spoils it doesn't give everyone the right to
[0:43:19] <+D00msDayDan> firmly grasp the orb
[0:43:31] <Tisaric> DUNK
[0:43:31] <lol_red_ranger> run THEN jump
[0:43:31] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Pat must unleash the monster within
[0:43:32] <TheEvilOmega> Then I started Devil May Cry 2, and... WOW is that game very not great.
[0:43:33] <Mr_Strut> dunk it
[0:43:39] <%Buzzard42> ORB IT UP

[0:44:11] <ulcaban> Voice getting hype
[0:44:16] <%superc37> that being said, anyone in chat know exactly when the spoiler scene happens? do you need to keep the gay treeman around or nah?
[0:44:22] <+Mrbaconator> SLORB
[0:44:24] <%Regigangster> Uh... it's spelled beauteous
[0:44:25] <%OperatorJo_> DUNK

[0:44:30] <%Saltmeisterr> BIG POINTS
[0:44:31] <%BubbaRands> So it's capture the flag...Except destroy the fire with orb?
[0:44:39] <californaya> Soliam Murr was my favorite Baseketball player
[0:44:43] <%Dementedpenguin> Yo this guy needs to narrate NBA games
[0:44:45] <Tisaric> It's basketball
[0:44:48] <%waltzqueen> OH YEAAAAAH
[0:44:51] <count_bob> It happens anyway.
[0:44:51] <Idon__> It's basketball
[0:44:53] <Tisaric> but with exliing the enemies with auras
[0:44:55] <%toastybites> WHAT A SAVE
[0:44:56] <otakon17> I think Pat just stumbled upon a strategy there
[0:44:58] <dinnydanny777> Woo go Besaid Aurochs!
[0:45:06] <primaryfire> @superc37 definitely happens before he becomes playable
[0:45:06] <otakon17> toss the orb to someone then immediately banish them
[0:45:07] <%goatbait> I always thought it was more likle soccer
[0:45:08] <Mr_Strut> What is your plan?
[0:45:09] <0rond> your aura was still regenerating
[0:45:10] <%laserbeaming> flinging the orb to your oponent and then killing them with your aura is a very Valid strategy
[0:45:11] <californaya> PAT, RT TO SPRINT
[0:45:14] <+Quack_of_Dawn> Remember to cast your aura, dummy
[0:45:14] <%SirGO0SE> they booli
[0:45:16] <Aydarkzero> did you lose aura circle for killing?

[0:45:58] <+sunsetserenity1> Is he doing this on purpose
[0:46:00] <%superc37> @primaryfire nice just wanted to make sure it wasnt missable by letting him go too early
[0:46:01] <%Regigangster> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:46:03] <+BlakeLocked> Pat. Shoot them. You can't throw the orb in.

[0:46:36] <%AncelDeLambert> Remember, folks. Pat was the BALL back in high school, so this is all a little strange to him
[0:46:36] <primaryfire> @superc37 either that or directly after, too soon for him to be enlightened. it's been about a year since I played so not 100% sure
[0:46:37] <%superc37> Oh this is gonna be a fun fail through
[0:46:37] <%OperatorJo_> just.... run in
[0:46:39] <%Erimos> He's learning. Now's the best time to experiment.

[0:46:43] <%Saltmeisterr> U can throw it in
[0:46:44] <BoneBagMel> Magic sportbal is hard
[0:46:48] <+BlakeLocked> Pat you have to throw YOURSELF in, you can't throw the orb in alone.
[0:46:52] <%bevyrage> quit trying to be fancy in the tutorial when you don't have the fancy shit

[0:47:15] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> THIS GAME IS A THIEF doodBait
[0:47:15] <anAngryHamster> STOP THROWING THE BALL
[0:47:15] <%Regigangster> Oh it was small
[0:47:16] <%Typhaeon> You CAN throw it in

[0:47:18] <Vashido22> you can
[0:47:20] <Tisaric> @PatStaresAt you can throw it in

[0:47:23] <Idon__> You can throw it in
[0:47:23] <%skizzuto> no you can throw it in
[0:47:23] <Vashido22> you can also throw it
[0:47:24] <Aydarkzero> would be a lot cooler if you did
[0:47:27] <Sol_Install> yes
[0:47:28] <ha2ken> Ritualistic combat ball...ok game
[0:47:28] <%OperatorJo_> You CAN but throwing sucks
[0:47:30] <scrumbotime> You can you just need to do it good
[0:47:30] <thesilverbard> you can throw it, but you have to hit the middle
[0:47:30] <Mr_Strut> You have to Micheal Jordan it
[0:47:33] <%Typhaeon> Fewer points
[0:47:34] <StaticSunrise> you CAN throw
[0:47:36] <lol_red_ranger> throwing is also much harder
[0:47:37] <californaya> Yeah, you can totally jump and catch it, so
[0:47:37] <mrlastchance1> you can but it's not as good
[0:47:38] <%skizzuto> if you throw it you don't lose the person who scores
[0:47:38] <Aydarkzero> just aim better 4Head
[0:47:38] <+xeros720> CAST DOWN YOUR HOPE for a three pointer
[0:47:38] <%bevyrage> there is a skill you can get on a couple of peeps who can throw in the ball easier, but your aim just sucks
[0:47:42] <Tisaric> @PatStaresAt there's also a reason to throw in that will get explained soon
[0:47:46] <Idon__> you nevah listen
[0:47:50] <%BubbaRands> Just get good
[0:47:52] <%laserbeaming> I recommend practicing
[0:47:52] <+Tomschiii> god i Wonder how He is doing the voice
[0:47:57] <%ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> I wish this game had date sim mechanics
[0:48:02] <%Erimos> Dunks are for players who can't throw.
[0:48:13] <Murphio_GS> Did pat just do a frenchism
[0:48:17] <californaya> I mean, you can totally spend time with people
[0:48:24] <californaya> and they get bonuses in the next matcvh
[0:48:29] <Idon__> Up until Hades, this was legit my favorite supergiant game, hope you enjoy Pat.
[0:48:30] <%emperordread> Show me the way Horned Wife

[0:52:14] <%OperatorJo_> only thing I'll say for this game is that MONEY is the best buff you can have. Money over buffs every time if there's an option for it.

[0:54:10] <californaya> I didn't read the lore AT ALL, I just wanted to do social links and play Fantasy Basketball
[0:54:23] <Mr_Strut> Is this why reading is illegal?

[1:02:34] <%Stormzcales_Lair> i mean you are a tank
[1:02:34] <Manwad> dab on em
[1:02:39] <primaryfire> taunts can be kinda hard to use though
[1:02:45] <CappuccinoGuil> so are they exclusive to each other? Like, do you only get one tree or the other?
[1:02:46] <T_Sasquatch> Words
[1:02:47] <%waltzqueen> DAHKNESS
[1:02:55] <%BubbaRands> THIS BGM S L A P P S
[1:02:57] <+Orenjevel> Taunting is much easier when the entire team is banished by dashing into them
[1:02:58] <%laserbeaming> doggy snore
[1:02:58] <Tisaric> you can mix the trees I think
[1:03:00] <californaya> you do not get enough points for both trees, no
[1:03:01] <%waltzqueen> PURR
[1:03:02] <Tisaric> but it's not really worth it
[1:03:07] <primaryfire> nah you can upgrade both trees, you just won't get to the end of both @CappuccinoGuil
[1:03:11] <+GrandmasterBFunk> is that purring
[1:03:12] <Tisaric> you want the bottom one usually
[1:03:20] <CappuccinoGuil> @primaryfire gotcha
[1:03:21] <chocobodundee> I think you the last skill in each is exclusive
[1:03:22] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> round cuhrazy boy gets a taunt tree, DOESNT pick it; could you imagine such a world
[1:03:24] <+BubbaRands> UNTIL IT IS DONE
[1:03:29] <reonome> Kreygasm
[1:03:29] <californaya> yeah, there's just straight up not enough points/levels for both skill trees
[1:03:30] <+campasino> That's a nice fursuit that guys wearing
[1:03:32] <%Erimos> Can confirm, Lendel is a lying asshole.
[1:03:33] <CappuccinoGuil> oh oh oh, hang out with Hedwyn <3
[1:03:34] <%hax_metatron> Jodariel or Vagabond girl are guaranteed to be his MVP, and I can’t wait until he has to make “the decision”
[1:03:36] <JaseAdrift> Jodariel gets to leave first based on principle
[1:03:36] <%waltzqueen> Hedwyn has someone
[1:03:42] <%Piemen99> UNTIL ITS DONE

[1:15:39] <Vashido22> kinda
[1:15:39] <DSD24> She's not crazy
[1:15:39] <aeonicvector> a lil
[1:15:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> kinda
[1:15:41] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> She's a little.... off.
[1:15:43] <%OperatorJo_> yes and no
[1:15:44] <reddpop_> She's "Touched"
[1:15:44] <Gutsandlove> ehh
[1:15:44] <%Piemono> She's your boss Pat
[1:15:44] <%BubbaRands> Sure?
[1:15:45] <%skizzuto> she's moon-touched
[1:15:45] <%waltzqueen> yes! But she's also kind of psychic
[1:15:45] <%Erimos> It's open to interpretation.
[1:15:45] <JaseAdrift> yes
[1:15:46] <Idon__> She's just... moon touched.
[1:15:47] <dinnydanny777> Kae? Like Kael from Omikron?
[1:15:47] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> ...
[1:15:50] <televisedrevolting> She's the Lorax she speaks to the carts.
[1:15:52] <+Orenjevel> She's a level 1 cleric
[1:15:53] <%laserbeaming> She might be crazy, or she might be connected with something weird
[1:15:53] <Aydarkzero> did her name option matter in the end?
[1:15:56] <aeonicvector> She's a bit moontouched
[1:15:57] <%Zalthia> Kinda
[1:15:58] <%Totally_Not_Toby> what's wrong with crazy you son of a bitch
[1:15:58] <%Regigangster> Idk, Pat, is the person that didnt know her name crazy?
[1:15:59] <%Erimos> Her insight is at like 40 right now.
[1:15:59] <+OwlLightningMage> Wagons are people too
[1:16:07] <Flux530> The official term is "Moon Touched"
[1:16:08] <BoneofMalkav> "I'm Kae the Unkempt, Like Linus the Tech Tips!" LUL
[1:16:11] <televisedrevolting> She's like those Vampires from Blood Masquerade
[1:16:11] <%waltzqueen> 40 insight Kae
[1:16:12] <%SirGO0SE> shes iirc a good replacement/secondary rukie?
[1:16:12] <LoneFonte> she's malkavian
[1:16:22] <vVAstrAVv> moon touched is basically crazy yes
[1:16:25] <Aydarkzero> thats a trick to just walk the dog!
[1:16:31] <DSD24> Why does Rukey not have his mustache
[1:16:31] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> @SirGO0SE She's amazing once leveled up
[1:16:43] <Tisaric> Study early
[1:16:46] <+Orenjevel> Bae is the best at 3 pointers
[1:16:49] <Aydarkzero> mentor sounds good
[1:16:56] <primaryfire> I hate that she's a great party member for the rites because I can't stand her
[1:16:57] <Tisaric> yeah
[1:16:59] <Vashido22> do what you want pat
[1:16:59] <%waltzqueen> Kae is so good once she has the points
[1:17:02] <Vashido22> yes
[1:17:02] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> yes, think so
[1:17:03] <televisedrevolting> Yes
[1:17:03] <%Gogogolem> Yeah
[1:17:06] <aeonicvector> all 3 provide SOME perm benefit
[1:17:08] <StaticSunrise> mentor is free xp
[1:17:08] <%skizzuto> yes, they're permanent
[1:17:09] <%SirGO0SE> yeah my memory is shoddy but she can really move the ball ya? @TallGuyWithAHoodie
[1:17:11] <thesilverbard> Study bonuses are small but permanent
[1:17:12] <primaryfire> yes
[1:17:14] <JaseAdrift> @DSD24 pat got rid of it
[1:17:15] <+Orenjevel> Study in Private gives permanent bonuses to your team, I've always gone with that but you can always max it out over the course of the game
[1:17:15] <+OK__Gamer> so do for all, an d
[1:17:15] <Sol_Install> yes
[1:17:17] <%OperatorJo_> always Forage for goodies is my strat
[1:17:18] <%Erimos> Yes
[1:17:20] <Vashido22> basically
[1:17:21] <%Gogogolem> There all good you can't go wrong.
[1:17:22] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I think so, been awhile.
[1:17:28] <primaryfire> best to exhaust studies before pursuing other things
[1:17:30] <DSD24> @JaseAdrift I didn't know you can do that
[1:17:34] <aeonicvector> @SirGO0SE Moontouched is, iirc, the BEST dunker in the game
[1:17:35] <fritz_dacat> mentor?
[1:17:36] <Tisaric> You can max out your studying
[1:17:40] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> @SirGO0SE Depending on how you level her I think you can choose sick three-pointers or dunks from miles away
[1:17:46] <Tisaric> So it's best to do it early imo
[1:18:01] <StaticSunrise> i n f l u e n c e r
[1:18:04] <%Piemen99> does every time have a reader for the rites?
[1:18:12] <reonome> what is this, persona?
[1:18:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> mm celery
[1:18:26] <aeonicvector> @reonome kinda yeah
[1:18:35] <Sol_Install> yes
[1:18:36] <%Piemen99> team*
[1:18:37] <+Orenjevel> just need some peanut butter
[1:18:38] <HorribleHog> Celleryty? When's Cauliflowerity?
[1:18:38] <Tisaric> I don't remember if it's explained but there are team leaders at least
[1:18:46] <%waltzqueen> @reonome yeah
[1:18:47] <Tisaric> so I think they kind of do each have a reader
[1:18:55] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> @reonome it's the best story-rich magical 3-on-3 basketball rpg ever
[1:18:55] <HorribleHog> haHAA
[1:18:57] <JaseAdrift> @DSD24 Yeah Rukey asks if it suits him and your answer decides whether he keeps it or not
[1:19:03] <+Orenjevel> Speed vs Aura

[1:43:08] <Make_me_mad> This game's cast is one of my favorites.
[1:43:16] <Make_me_mad> I like the whole main party and most of the antagonists.
[1:43:23] <%waltzqueen> YEAH
[1:43:28] <DSD24> Ah yes its amazing art man
[1:43:58] <Tisaric> I love the races they made for this

[1:44:17] <%AFlyingTaco1> This whole game just oozes style
[1:44:28] <Make_me_mad> Of course Supergiant is gonna give you a bard.
[1:44:34] <Vashido22> IS IT TIME?
[1:44:43] <StaticSunrise> fun fact, Tariq is voiced by Darren Korb, the composer
[1:44:50] <DSD24> Yay its Ron
[1:45:03] <Tisaric> Supergiant has made sure every game has some sort of musical character for Darren/Ashly, it's great
[1:45:05] <DSD24> @StaticSunrise Doesn't he voice Zagreus in Hades too?
[1:45:06] <%Erimos> Drugs
[1:45:14] <+Orenjevel> Ron's dad is fast as fuck

[1:45:43] <aeonicvector> it pays for itself quickly if you use a dedicated attacker

[1:46:12] <0rond> aren't you teaching him that farting will get him pets?
[1:46:14] <Tisaric> yeah Darren started some VA in this game and does a lot of actual lines in Hades
[1:46:14] <%SirGO0SE> uh oh stinky :)
[1:46:18] <thesilverbard> The contract pays itself off quickly, unless you spend stardust to upgrade it
[1:46:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "no"
[1:46:23] <%BinaryFireball> Zangief seems super chill for a puppy
[1:46:29] <%BinaryFireball> maybe that's a bulldog thing?
[1:46:34] <%SirGO0SE> i wish i got pets when i farted
[1:46:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @0rond it doesn't always work like that
[1:46:42] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> he is very fat and lazy
[1:46:43] <Make_me_mad> The contract is pretty outstanding. You can just farm takedowns in an easy match or when you have a lead and make a ton of cash.
[1:46:43] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> i love him
[1:46:45] <%BinaryFireball> haha
[1:46:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> Perfect pet for dog

[1:47:08] <%BinaryFireball> you are correct
[1:47:17] <primaryfire> stardust is almost always a good buy
[1:47:36] <Tisaric> yeah I always bought up any stardust
[1:47:44] <%riderstrike152> riderstrike152 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 17 month streak! You said everything gets pats, but does Pat get pats?

[1:48:38] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt Also voiced by the game's composer

[2:06:21] <Gutsandlove> sandra the best
[2:06:23] <DSD24> @count_bob If you haven't played in awhile sure but recent you should keep going
[2:06:23] <%Saltmeisterr> READER
[2:07:01] <%Saltmeisterr> God i hope supergiant ports Pyre to the switch
[2:07:20] <DSD24> Its been a PS4 exclusive this whole time right?
[2:07:32] <%Erimos> Pyre would be so perfect for Switch.
[2:07:39] <%Saltmeisterr> its on pc i believe
[2:08:07] <DSD24> @Saltmeisterr Ah I see it now
[2:08:15] <Vashido22> its on ps4 and pc
[2:08:42] <%Bt_Robot> Why is Zangief drawn with different lighting, he looks like he doesn't belong...
[2:09:27] <%Saltmeisterr> yeah its super weird
[2:09:32] <count_bob> Hadn't played in two years.
[2:09:33] <+ALazo> He was drawn later, at least
[2:09:35] <%Saltmeisterr> who did this intro again?
[2:09:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> He was added later by a different artiest
[2:09:37] <count_bob> Totally need to redo it.
[2:10:05] <%Ranryu692> I thought Volta did Zangief as well
[2:10:12] <lol_red_ranger> the orb calls for dog
[2:10:23] <%AFlyingTaco1> Jodi's is fucking brutal
[2:10:42] <+Snacbo> This is a cool character - make sure to talk to her often, she gets dialogue updates every now and then
[2:10:51] <%SirGO0SE> Kreygasm
[2:10:56] <DSD24> Sandra's the best
[2:11:10] <lol_red_ranger> great start
[2:11:25] <%heartlesshealer> Have fun with SportFlame! Also orb girl is super cool
[2:11:26] <+gksnipa> sandra best grill
[2:11:43] <+LandOfTheWay> glad to see everyone loves sandra, as they should
[2:11:52] <%Erimos> Sandra will whip you into shape.
[2:11:52] <Tisaric> oh yeah the trials are a big fuck you to the archetype you're training
[2:11:54] <Tisaric> it's great
[2:11:56] <%AFlyingTaco1> Yeah some of these are difficult
[2:11:57] <Vashido22> she'a the best
[2:12:14] <chocobodundee> these are def tough, coming back with more levels helps
[2:12:16] <%AFlyingTaco1> We in there
[2:12:32] <lol_red_ranger> just achieve basketball
[2:12:32] <DSD24> I like these trials cause they get you to learn your moveset
[2:12:43] <Oncamimus> the art and animation are insanely awesome
[2:13:02] <Tisaric> the fire/cast animations are fucking gorgeous
[2:13:04] <CappuccinoGuil> what stays? what is he talking about?
[2:13:05] <Tisaric> I love that style
[2:13:13] <RaidenRising> is this magic basketball
[2:13:21] <%AFlyingTaco1> Yes
[2:13:24] <%laserbeaming> throw the ball at them so you can kill them
[2:13:26] <CappuccinoGuil> someone explain to me like I'm the clueless spectator in a sports anime
[2:13:27] <fritz_dacat> shot the J Pat
[2:13:29] <RaidenRising> cool
[2:13:35] <Oncamimus> with puppers
[2:13:35] <+213372bu> The problem is that this game never really gets hard, just keep killing and you'll get an easy run in
[2:13:47] <DSD24> @CappuccinoGuil You gotta get the orb into the opponents goal
[2:13:48] <%Ranryu692> so it's basketball with aids?
[2:13:49] <%logoth_> Is this game canon in the space jam universe
[2:13:58] <Tisaric> @CappuccinoGuil the aura you have around the characters can be shot and it was sticking around longer than he thought
[2:13:59] <meikogodspeak> Yeah the game does look pretty neat o.o
[2:14:03] <RaidenRising> yes
[2:14:06] <DSD24> @CappuccinoGuil Depending on the size of the character they are worth more points
[2:14:26] <CappuccinoGuil> @DSD24 *gasp* I see... Pat must've trained really hard to have such solid basics
[2:14:27] <Dao_Puppy> Is there a scene where the players dad is killed because of gambling debts?
[2:14:42] <%heartlesshealer> Jumping is super real if you have the mind for it
[2:14:49] <DSD24> IT IS DONE
[2:14:54] <%Bt_Robot> YOU HAVE DOUBLE JUMP, WHY YOU NO USE?
[2:14:55] <%Erimos> @213372bu it definitely gets harder later on. It has difficulty modifiers plus a hard difficulty, so the challenge is there.
[2:14:56] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Oh no! Peach's evil twin, Pear has locked up the babies! Which one do you shoot? The one taking the ham off the sandwich or the one coughing on moldy potato salad? There's only one bullet so no take backs!
[2:15:01] <%laserbeaming> noxalas indeed
[2:15:02] <Tisaric> I almost always jumped in
[2:15:02] <+SinnerEbru> PogChamp
[2:15:04] <rektasaurus_rekts> look tried asf pat
[2:15:04] <count_bob> NOXALUS!
[2:15:05] <Oncamimus> yay puppo!
[2:15:07] <CappuccinoGuil> I would've just let one of them score so it'd be 1v2
[2:15:09] <$jodio_> I love Sandra
[2:15:12] <DSD24> To your lovely reader
[2:15:19] <%SirGO0SE> youre doing pretty well btw Pat
[2:15:29] <DSD24> Everyone loves Sandra
[2:15:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Neat
[2:15:41] <lol_red_ranger> touch imp
[2:15:58] <lol_red_ranger> hell yeah
[2:16:02] <%heartlesshealer> So Sandra also gives you The Good Shit when yo do her trials, in addition to just being cool
[2:16:10] <%Valdorick> If I recall, the Rite trinkets are all OP as fuck
[2:16:15] <%Erimos> All these bird goblins
[2:16:26] <Tisaric> you can only do trails once they become available
[2:16:28] <lol_red_ranger> you will practice
[2:16:32] <DSD24> Plus you can hang out with Sandra later
[2:16:32] <Tisaric> so it defaulted to practice
[2:16:33] <+213372bu> @Erimos I played it through once on as hard as I can get it, I just found the AI to be reliably weird near their goal, making dumb jumps or opening themselves up for deaths. Might have been a bug on launch, but the gameplay was a tad disappointing at the time
[2:16:39] <lol_red_ranger> they have to become worthy
[2:16:46] <%laserbeaming> that fire effect never ceases to amaze me
[2:16:48] <+213372bu> @Erimos Not sure about modifiers
[2:16:58] <absolute_cagemony> Pat??? More like....CAT. gottem.
[2:17:03] <%heartlesshealer> pat
[2:17:08] <CappuccinoGuil> Can't farm? FUCK THAT
[2:17:11] <%heartlesshealer> okay he saw the button
[2:17:26] <Tisaric> every supergiant game is based on choosing your own difficulty based on optional modifiers
[2:17:27] <%AFlyingTaco1> That's why they're practice rites
[2:17:39] <DSD24> Beyonders is a good team name
[2:17:43] <%Erimos> @213372bu the AI is a bit predictable, I'll admit. There's a difficulty modifier that makes the AI smarter, and it's way way harder.
[2:18:11] <+213372bu> @Erimos Fair enough
[2:18:18] <DSD24> Well the first part of the game is introducing the mechanics
[2:18:20] <CappuccinoGuil> Game's like "Here's a practice option that doesn't reward XP" THEN WHAT'S THE POINT?
[2:18:35] <DSD24> @CappuccinoGuil Practice party comps?
[2:18:45] <%Erimos> @213372bu True Nightwing difficulty is a blast to play once you beat the game. It even adds a couple new mechanics like optional challenges.
[2:18:50] <%heartlesshealer> enjoy choices, the SuperGiant staple
[2:18:51] <%Valdorick> The practice aera is more for comps and trinket min/maxing
[2:18:52] <Make_me_mad> @CappuccinoGuil Actual practice to become better at the game?
[2:19:00] <Vashido22> @cappuccinoguil learn how to play the game
[2:19:10] <Vashido22> thats kinda the point
[2:19:13] <CappuccinoGuil> @DSD24 trial by fire, take the new comp to a real match
[2:19:17] <%heartlesshealer> love seeing the wagon roll around
[2:19:24] <CappuccinoGuil> @Vashido22 the game is doing pretty good at that so far
[2:19:41] <Vashido22> wich is why training is optional
[2:19:41] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> monkaS
[2:19:45] <Zebroneath> This place fucking sucks
[2:20:02] <absolute_cagemony> Why get better at the game when you can just grind off screen?
[2:20:05] <chocobodundee> this place rules
[2:20:18] <machinarium> there's also a story reason that will force/limit certain comps so you might need the practice
[2:20:24] <%SirGO0SE> psaGoblin
[2:21:07] <%heartlesshealer> So now Jodi's here
[2:21:18] <%Bt_Robot> JODI ANGRY?
[2:21:27] <%heartlesshealer> the portaits in this game are so good
[2:21:46] <+b_aleph> Aleph stares at Pat!
[2:21:55] <CappuccinoGuil> I'm scaroused of her
[2:22:07] <Vashido22> I'm horny, not scared. Or both
[2:22:10] <+Rusty_beartrap> As scared of you as boner is big
[2:22:13] <+SammyOVision> Just grow horns pat, become a demon
[2:22:16] <%heartlesshealer> ENJOY IMPLICATIONS
[2:22:16] <%waltzqueen> Hurt her feelings
[2:22:16] <%emperordread> Crush me horned mommy
[2:22:18] <SGrim> DON'T BE MEAN TO HORN WIFE
[2:22:20] <%Erimos> Jodi will remember this.
[2:22:24] <%Ranryu692> I'm scaroused
[2:22:30] <CappuccinoGuil> You just told her she's scary, Pat, and not in a hot way
[2:22:32] <+pectusumbra> true but sad
[2:22:33] <scrumbotime> You called her a big scary monster so she's upside
[2:22:36] <%AFlyingTaco1> Learn how giant horned girls work Pat, jeez

[2:28:19] <%Valdorick> The AI pass tech
[2:28:23] <Tisaric> yeah I think it's only local MP
[2:28:24] <0rond> HE LOVES IT
[2:28:31] <Tisaric> parsec would work well enough probably
[2:28:33] <Vashido22> they were going to do online, but decided to focus on single player
[2:28:37] <%Erimos> @SirGO0SE local only, yeah
[2:28:41] <Vashido22> yeah parsec is great for this
[2:28:44] <reonome> BEGONE WITCH

[2:31:03] <+pectusumbra> Hoes mad x24 is all I hear
[2:31:07] <%Erimos> @aeonicvector that's exactly how I'd describe it.
[2:31:15] <Tisaric> it's important that they keep growing regardless
[2:31:21] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt Fun fact: the snake lady also shares va with zagreus
[2:31:31] <%laserbeaming> support Hedwin is pretty good
[2:31:46] <ManfredA> remember that it wasn't just Jordan
[2:31:53] <ManfredA> he had Pippin and Rodman too
[2:31:53] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Support seems like a handy niche
[2:31:54] <ManfredA> teamwork wins games
[2:32:00] <aeonicvector> both trees on MOST (all?) characters are atleast usably great
[2:32:02] <%laserbeaming> @PatStaresAt Hey BTW, don't enter VS mode until you finish the game. There's massive spoilers there
[2:32:12] <%Saltmeisterr> wait Darren voices ulmilde?

[2:34:04] <+SammyOVision> Oh yeah this game is a fucking slow burn
[2:34:04] <%arancet> whys that

[2:34:06] <%superc37> PAT CMON
[2:34:06] <%Saltmeisterr> and here we go
[2:34:06] <%cvp5127> called it
[2:34:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Fair enough
[2:34:07] <SGrim> I feel you.
[2:34:07] <Gutsandlove> sure
[2:34:08] <%dante_must_die_exe> understandable
[2:34:10] <+coolthulhuu> not another one
[2:34:11] <primaryfire> o no
[2:34:11] <%Ranryu692> lol I think that was your opinion last time
[2:34:11] <Khorneflakes_> It's very slow
[2:34:12] <Vashido22> how
[2:34:12] <%SirGO0SE> you did great, but thats super fair
[2:34:14] <Make_me_mad> I figured Pat wouldn't like it. It is the best Supergiant game by a mile, though.
[2:34:14] <%Erimos> That's disappointing, but understandable.
[2:34:15] <red_cuppa> low-key same ;-;
[2:34:16] <%cobalt_phoenix_> what about it?
[2:34:17] <tattleworm> get in the box with p5 and roguelike week or whatever
[2:34:17] <+MisterMusashi> Jebaited
[2:34:17] <RaidenRising> sure
[2:34:18] <0rond> a shame
[2:34:18] <%afronooch> LUL
[2:34:19] <aeonicvector> I think its supergiants best game overall, but totally understandable
[2:34:20] <+Orenjevel> aww, oh well
[2:34:21] <%bevyrage> you just haven't found the character with the tiny hat yet pat
[2:34:23] <count_bob> I love this game so much.
[2:34:24] <%Bt_Robot> TOO MUCH READING?
[2:34:27] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That's too bad. But we're all different.
[2:34:28] <LilacsandFreedom> oh well
[2:34:29] <Vashido22> thats disappointing, but understandable
[2:34:30] <%emperordread> it would take a gorillion streams to actually finish
[2:34:31] <Zebroneath> That's fair
[2:34:32] <CappuccinoGuil> It's a sports game, of course you don't like it
[2:34:33] <reddpop_> Give us more Hades then at least
[2:34:33] <+pectusumbra> wow really? Not mad just surprised, you seemed into it
[2:34:33] <+coolthulhuu> ive heard this from so many people lol
[2:34:35] <Vashido22> I personaly love it
[2:34:38] <%SirKeigan> Can you sum it up in a sentence?
[2:34:39] <%cvp5127> 2/4 isnt bad
[2:34:41] <0rond> it's bad for streaming LP
[2:34:42] <fritz_dacat> psaHoldon really
[2:34:42] <%SirGO0SE> you gave it a fair shake, theres definitely way more to it but if you feel that way at this point then fuck it
[2:34:44] <BentArcher> Go back to COD if you hate thinking so much
[2:34:51] <%sleepers1mulant> That’s fair honestly pat
[2:34:56] <Sunstalker> Play SIx Ages
[2:34:56] <%Spydurman> Agreed it's not fun imo, sports ball is boring
[2:34:59] <%emperordread> More Star Renegades
[2:35:00] <%laserbeaming> LUL
[2:35:00] <+chensterrain> tbf a lot of people hate it
[2:35:01] <Ids560> I like it but I feel like it takes too long to get every character
[2:35:01] <%Arweynn> Me either. It just gets worse honestly. I got through 1 Rite and gave up halfway through the second.
[2:35:01] <DSD24> That's a bad take
[2:35:01] <0rond> this is 100% LP poison
[2:35:01] <+Mrbaconator> LUL
[2:35:02] <%SirKeigan> Until now
[2:35:02] <LilacsandFreedom> yeah, fair shake's good

[2:35:17] <0rond> having to read everything outloud is taxing as hell

[2:35:18] <+Mrbaconator> ONE GUY LUL
[2:35:18] <+Rusty_beartrap> Your bosses say to keep playing

[2:35:21] <Blank9> go back to aegis rim if you hate thinking so much
[2:35:21] <%SirKeigan> Play some Warzone
[2:35:22] <+Mundkipz> is blitz ball more fun?
[2:35:22] <Tisaric> but yes I don't think it's a good LP game
[2:35:22] <+ThomasOfTroy> Please be new
[2:35:23] <artificiallynatural> a ton of reading and not enough gameplay moments. I find the gameplay interesting, but it just doesn't happen enough
[2:35:23] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Pat plays so much COD

[2:37:06] <ManfredA> I'll ask again
[2:37:06] <%BubbaRands> Oh I'm looking forward to that
[2:37:09] <%OperatorJo_> miasF
[2:37:12] <+Mrbaconator> ALARM
[2:37:12] <ManfredA> have you ever tried Cultist Sim Pat?
[2:37:16] <%TheWinged7> cart? is it time for alarms?
[2:37:17] <%BubbaRands> !PAT AT RISK!
[2:37:32] <aeonicvector> Def give it a try by yourself, but if it dosent mesh it dosent mesh
[2:37:35] <dizor> Yeah pyre was pretty meh for me
[2:37:36] <%waltzqueen> uktist Sim is SO HARD
[2:37:36] <%SirGO0SE> cultist sim is a lot like slay the spire right..?
[2:37:38] <ManfredA> it's a trip is what it is
[2:37:38] <+pectusumbra> Ah, I've mentioned that in the past. It's a weird, super lore heavy single player card game. It's a lot of fun
[2:37:40] <0rond> CULTIST SIM REALLY COOL AND ALSO NOT GREAT FOR LP
[2:37:40] <+SammyOVision> Cultist simulator is totally not a pat stream game.
[2:37:44] <aeonicvector> still my favorite super giant, even THO its a hard sell
[2:37:54] <ManfredA> yeah don't stream it
[2:37:56] <+pectusumbra> It's goal is actually Your goal.
[2:37:57] <0rond> nothing like slay the spire
[2:37:57] <red_cuppa> lmao
[2:37:59] <aeonicvector> Cult Sim is great, not a Pat game
[2:37:59] <LilacsandFreedom> I really love Pyre, but yeah, it's not for everybody
[2:38:03] <+pectusumbra> Probably not good for stream
[2:38:03] <Gutsandlove> LUL
[2:38:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That's fair. I know Transistor is a great game and all, but I've never been able to get into it. Not all games are for everyone
[2:38:06] <%waltzqueen> Same! Pyre still has my heart even if no one else likes it
[2:38:06] <%DappercatEsquire> i take it by your reaction that you love it
[2:38:09] <%sleepers1mulant> Cultist sim is an anti-pat game
[2:38:10] <reonome> why does pat not like the game again
[2:38:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is he gonna do more hades later on?
[2:38:14] <0rond> cultist sim is a solid 8.5 but bad for LPs
[2:38:15] <haitakaa> it's a Liam game
[2:38:19] <ManfredA> it would break your brain
[2:38:24] <%BubbaRands> THE PAT DO NOT LIKE
[2:38:26] <CappuccinoGuil> also, dev of cultist simulator sucks
[2:38:26] <Tisaric> cultist sim is not like sts but it's also interesting
[2:38:30] <%Valdorick> Cultist Sim is... fucking oof
[2:38:33] <%Valdorick> Hit or miss
[2:38:35] <aeonicvector> Pyre is def a [Redacted] game
[2:38:48] <%PettyFunk> PettyFunk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Hiya Pat! So my bar went out of business during the shutdown and my coffeeshop got smashed up in a protest. Boy howdy yeehaw, thanks for providing some levity during wild times. Much love for you, Paige, and the little ones <3 <3 <3
[2:38:52] <+VoxelFox51> ye cultist sim is weird
[2:38:59] <+chiluzza> @PatStaresAt newegg crashed when they put it up
[2:39:02] <%DappercatEsquire> that's like 3 Pats
[2:39:10] <ManfredA> he prolly also has horrible problems
[2:39:11] <+pectusumbra> That said, please do try Renowned Explorers during Rougelike month?
[2:39:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Seems very inconvenient
[2:39:16] <haitakaa> shorter people live longer
[2:39:19] <ManfredA> gigantism isn't fun
[2:39:24] <+pectusumbra> It's GREAT
[2:39:32] <aeonicvector> REIS is p good, but its weird
[2:39:39] <haitakaa> the less mass you have the longer you live on average
[2:39:43] <+pectusumbra> By Abby Games, same people as Reus
[2:39:45] <%DappercatEsquire> you mean Reus?
[2:39:49] <+pectusumbra> It's like a rougelike tactics
[2:39:50] <Kemmybelle> Pat doesn't drive, he can't stop Paige from going out and getting it herself.
[2:40:00] <aeonicvector> Renowned Explorers International Society, its actually great tactics
[2:40:01] <+pectusumbra> It's not a boardgame! It's like FTL X Tactics game!
[2:40:13] <%DappercatEsquire> that's fine, they tried something different
[2:40:16] <%SirGO0SE> has Slay the Spire crept into your mind at all since you played it? I kept finding myself thinking about that game after I played it the first time
[2:40:18] <ManfredA> I bounced off Transistor tbh
[2:40:19] <thatsocrunchy> Hey chat
[2:40:20] <+Ez3z> try gunfire reborn is good roguelike
[2:40:22] <anAngryHamster> Boo this man!
[2:40:22] <%PettyFunk> Darren Korb wins it big every time though
[2:40:24] <Gutsandlove> thats ok
[2:40:24] <thatsocrunchy> Hey pat
[2:40:25] <@SoFarFetched> So pat only likes Hades confirmed
[2:40:26] <ManfredA> Gotta give them props for trying new shit though
[2:40:28] <%Quigsies> Hades is definitely their best game
[2:40:40] <theanora1> At least Transistor is super short
[2:40:43] <%PettyFunk> PearDrool?
[2:40:47] <haitakaa> tags: petting
[2:40:51] <ManfredA> what did Pat think of 13 Sentinels btw, haven't watched the VOD yet
[2:40:52] <%DappercatEsquire> shoot yourself
[2:40:55] <ManfredA> I'm on the fence on it
[2:41:00] <%Valdorick> Shoot yourself
[2:41:09] <%onlystrykerfan> Dappercat gets it
[2:41:11] <%Valdorick> or do nothing, the real paige will kill the fake woman paige
[2:41:12] <aeonicvector> @Quigsies TBF, i think Pyre is legitimatley their best, but Hades is second for sure on me
[2:41:15] <%waltzqueen> My sub didn't show up! But thanks for playing Pyre. I know it's not everyone's favorite. Thanks for giving ym underrated favorite a solid try! @PatStaresAt
[2:41:33] <%Aeoneth> One Step From Eden since you skipped it this week?
[2:41:37] <%Ranryu692> new Left 4 Dead 2 update
[2:41:40] <%DappercatEsquire> pat hates splorts
[2:41:40] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
