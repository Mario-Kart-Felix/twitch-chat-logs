[0:22:18] <Blank9> this school may have a bunch of little shits
[0:22:25] <TerrifyingRei_05> they assume the teachers care
[0:22:26] <%gitgouda> im already loving this
[0:22:33] <%Puhff> they're basically just secret shoppers!
[0:22:40] <T_Sasquatch> honestly with all the dumb shit i said and did in school , many students would be suspended if there was video evidence LUL
[0:22:41] <pkthepipes> has there ever been a Yakuza/judgment cross over?
[0:22:43] <%strakillias> Of course you can't tell the teachers. What if one of the teachers is a bully?
[0:22:51] <Dova573> inb4 the school has a secret fighting tournament and students are trying to be the top Delinquent
[0:22:51] <Ardailec> Was also a big pot smoking spot in my day
[0:22:52] <%Undenizen> pushing down STAIRS? that's pretty bad! my bullies weren't that psycho
[0:22:54] <%DianaTheAscian> I remember falling down the stairs in HS
[0:22:55] <%topendbuzza> UHHH

[0:22:58] <%Dakuu75> dude... I took way too much shit in high school. If I could go back, with what I know now. I'd of been WAY more aggro
[0:22:59] <%TourettesPlays> So the principal doesn't want the students knowing where the cameras are installed??? What?
[0:23:01] <ghosrevan> kaito why do you know so much about bullying?
[0:23:10] <cardamomo88> BULLY HUNTERS¡¡¡¡

[0:23:29] <%topendbuzza> why at up skirt hight tho
[0:23:36] <%Puhff> As someone who's bully was also a teacher, sometimes the teachers ARE in on it
[0:23:39] <%LeiaSkynoober> @TourettesPlays They gotta catch the bullies off guard!
[0:23:41] <%Dakuu75> there's no graffiti anywhere?
[0:23:46] <OtakuSnake1> So if we find a bully, are out orders to drop kick them?
[0:23:47] <%Undenizen> you're gonna have to beat up some highschoolers

[0:41:56] <Sulfur_Boride> Man, it's real weird that they redid the lip sync for the dub for the in-game cutscenes, and not the cinematic ones this time around.

[0:42:09] <%RealThiele> whole lives for the next 5 minutes before we destroy them
[0:42:09] <%silvery_cricket> As someone that got bullied super bad as a kid, the idea any teacher can't suss out bullying in less than 5 minutes means they should be fired.

[0:42:23] <+Ploobie> one step closer to the edge, and she's about to break!
[0:42:23] <+WeLucklessJacks> People who have their whole lives ahead of them must be taught early not to pull this shit.
[0:42:25] <%SWFanatic> "I am the Law!" -Sojiro
[0:42:25] <%tank7013> That's the same defense that young athletes use to get away with raping people here
[0:42:27] <%TourettesPlays> "thats what the suicide bars are for!"
[0:42:27] <%holydeviant1> Who gives a fuck about their "futures"?!

[0:42:51] <olm46> Few grow out of it
[0:42:52] <+kewlmyc> Fuck em. If they take enjoyment out of ruining the lives of others, then fuck them
[0:42:53] <churropoppa> boys will be boys
[0:42:54] <%shootbang_exe> that + zero tolerance policies made shit rough
[0:42:55] <ohno778> They can change...
[0:42:55] <cardamomo88> dicks are always dicks
[0:42:56] <%faldin> Fuck that
[0:42:56] <%SovPho> my bullies became meth heads
[0:42:56] <%Mr_Pylon> it's another type of pandering for the aggressor
[0:42:56] <@Ranryu692> it's only a phase if you stop them
[0:42:56] <%Afterman_> honing their craft
[0:42:58] <DSD24> So lets destroy them
[0:42:58] <%silvery_cricket> My bully in middle school stabbed me

[0:43:02] <%Ynkubus_> Very few bullies actually grow out of it
[0:43:04] <%blastyoboots> "they have their whole lives ahead of them!" SO DID THE BULLIED KID THEIR BULLYING STUNTED THE LIVES OF. THEY SHOULD DIE

[0:45:26] <%polothegreatest> up
[0:45:27] <%chiazam> the onlookers
[0:45:27] <%gitgouda> YES PAT, YES
[0:45:32] <pkthepipes> exactly
[0:45:34] <%Mr_Pylon> There's no heat action being done
[0:45:34] <%gitgouda> out the window they go
[0:45:34] <+AnthonyJMax> you get one until its done
[0:45:35] <circular7> onlookers are bitches
[0:45:36] <bakkatohri> the window is the s3cret (contextual heat)
[0:45:40] <%RealThiele> not enough defenestration
[0:45:41] <%holydeviant1> "Listen, there's just not enough fists slamming into their jaws."
[0:45:44] <%Monkeyweed21> THE ONLOOKERS NEED TO HEAT MOVE THEM
[0:45:46] <ghosrevan> pats solution is better
[0:45:47] <toahmes> the conveniently large windows
[0:45:50] <+WaywardSera> the SEP Field
[0:45:50] <%SWFanatic> ah yes a flock of students
[0:45:50] <OkamiDude15> but the onlookers can outnumber the bullies
[0:45:51] <DusK_The_Stray> Outnumber the bullies, man. It's that easy
[0:45:51] <ohno778> JAPAN LOGIC
[0:45:55] <+JustToWatch> TRIAL BY COMBAT
[0:45:57] <%blastyoboots> TRIAL!?
[0:45:57] <DSD24> A Murder Trial
[0:45:58] <akitanito> witch trial!
[0:45:59] <%Treuan> Oh no we're gonna make it a dangan ronpa
[0:46:01] <%kyh9> Gang-on-gang violence >>> bullying
[0:46:02] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Unionize the students
[0:46:03] <%gitgouda> those windows look pretty fragile
[0:46:03] <%akscully> dagonrompa
[0:46:03] <%Undenizen> NOTHING could go wrong with this
[0:46:04] <%topendbuzza> ffs japan
[0:46:04] <%RealThiele> OBJECTION
[0:46:07] <circular7> A CLASS TRIAL
[0:46:07] <%silvery_cricket> @T_Sasquatch As someone who was bullied alot, not being harsh on the bully resolves literally nothing
[0:46:09] <ohno778> MORTAL KOMBAAAAAAT
[0:46:10] <@Ranryu692> ever heard of the Kitty Genovese Bystander Effect?
[0:46:10] <%machshop> kill the batman

[0:46:13] <%djazo> this game is just great teacher onizuka i love it
[0:46:16] <%polothegreatest> they arent even jacked or criminals
[0:46:20] <%shootbang_exe> this is very boomer and japanese
[0:46:21] <KingSwansJamboree> we have to SHAME them
[0:46:24] <%ScreamLord> And the punishment is a German Suplex
[0:46:27] <ToneBacas> ye
[0:46:28] <%CopperTucker> beat the child
[0:46:28] <%topendbuzza> onlookers RISE UP
[0:46:30] <%A_Zealous_Retort> gotta love the RGB keyboard
[0:46:35] <%kyh9> DOESNT KILL THEM ENOUGH TO FIGHT BACK
[0:46:36] <DusK_The_Stray> What makes you think they actually care?
[0:46:37] <T_Sasquatch> @silvery_cricket definitely but ... it just pisses of the bully to do worse
[0:46:37] <ghosrevan> why can't we just beat them again
[0:46:41] <circular7> no
[0:46:43] <DSD24> Or you just expel them
[0:46:44] <%machshop> send the bullies to cromartie high
[0:46:45] <+WaywardSera> that's...idealistic
[0:46:45] <%kyh9> GIVE THE ONLOOKERS A GUN
[0:46:47] <%amaranthos> this will never work
[0:46:48] <%SWFanatic> nani
[0:46:48] <olm46> Stick to fists
[0:46:48] <%gitgouda> or just shoot them
[0:46:48] <Dr_Mooose> yes
[0:46:52] <@ssjklyco> Teach all the kids how to fight
[0:46:52] <%Mr_Pylon> Yeah dude
[0:46:52] <%holydeviant1> This is what happens in Silent Voice
[0:46:53] <cardamomo88> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis THIS IS SO DUMB
[0:46:53] <circular7> this wouldn't happen irl
[0:46:54] <BrickleBork> probably\
[0:46:55] <%CopperTucker> or you can just expel them.
[0:46:55] <heli0hso> a bit exteme
[0:46:56] <$SGrim> emphatically, yes
[0:46:57] <%RealThiele> bullys are sociopaths they feel no shame
[0:47:00] <+KaijuUltimax> boomer writing
[0:47:04] <mangoes1> So anime
[0:47:04] <OneThousandTomatoes> i missed it, what happened after he ran to the room
[0:47:05] <%kyh9> GAMERS RISE UP
[0:47:05] <Zeif00> Beat em up
[0:47:05] <%anAngryHamster> Enough shame will stop almost any bully
[0:47:05] <$apolitenoob> We come in by BEATING THE CHILDREN
[0:47:06] <@ssjklyco> Bloodsport
[0:47:07] <%tank7013> It would probably just make the bullies double down
[0:47:07] <%machshop> the fire rises
[0:47:09] <%silvery_cricket> @T_Sasquatch No it forces the point that their are consequences that are severe
[0:47:09] <%KaiserMario> Well... Japan's kinda nuts about social exile
[0:47:09] <+WaywardSera> it just makes the bullies stick together harder and become their own support group. This is how you get gangs
[0:47:09] <+TheBitingIrish> Yea! Bully the bullies!
[0:47:11] <%Undenizen> no...
[0:47:11] <studleydoorite> burn down the bullies with fire pepoG
[0:47:12] <%chiazam> No they don't actually
[0:47:12] <Blank9> bully the bullies
[0:47:13] <%SWFanatic> this is some inception level bullying
[0:47:14] <KingSwansJamboree> solution: start child gang violence
[0:47:15] <cardamomo88> GAMERS
[0:47:16] <%Undenizen> oh
[0:47:16] <ghosrevan> Tak i don't think this will work
[0:47:18] <T_Sasquatch> This is so bizzare
[0:47:18] <%CopperTucker> they all need to be dropkicked from orbit
[0:47:19] <%RealThiele> fire the children. from a cannon
[0:47:26] <%Felhad> now the bullis are the ones who are nerd
[0:47:26] <%CodyStruggles> The cruelty is the point
[0:47:27] <%Undenizen> i thought they were gonna "HELLO FELLOW KIDS"
[0:47:30] <%polothegreatest> get bigger numbers and  BEAT the bullies
[0:47:33] <%gitgouda> we can always pistol whip them if it dosnt work
[0:47:35] <%silvery_cricket> HOW ABOUT YOU ACTUALLY JUST PUNISH THEM
[0:47:35] <+Ploobie> lol they're gonna yell "fuck you bullies" through the speakers
[0:47:37] <+izanagi22> Yagami are you seriously about to Voice of God the bullying?
[0:47:39] <MarvelousMrD> in a fight is would this guy beat ichiban?
[0:47:40] <@ssjklyco> Are they gonna haunt the kids?
[0:47:41] <jorniev> OH DID I ARRIVE ON TIME FOR BEATING CHILDREN!?
[0:47:55] <DusK_The_Stray> You've been standing idly by this entire time.
[0:47:55] <%gitgouda> @ssjklyco oh i want that to be the case so badly
[0:47:59] <%RealThiele> unlike when i stood idly by
[0:48:01] <ohno778> But you've been doing that
[0:48:02] <%CopperTucker> in a fight Ichiban would beat these children
[0:48:08] <%senorpapel> Does make me feel good that all my middleschool bullies are druggies in my hometown.
[0:48:09] <%silvery_cricket> This scene feels like it was written talking to a councilor and not an actual victim of bullying
[0:48:10] <%nipplestheenchilada96> BEAT THEIR ASS
[0:48:11] <%baka_sugoi> I NEED MORE POWER
[0:48:13] <cardamomo88> BULLY THE BULLY
[0:48:14] <%akscully> cuno doesn't give a shit!
[0:48:17] <%djazo> shank the child no one will care
[0:48:19] <%Eaglestrike117> Pat, remember, this is japan. SOCIETY IS A BIG THING
[0:48:19] <%Raikouija> They need to get their shit pushed in hard. That's how they shut up
[0:48:24] <%ThomasOfTroy> I choked the shit out of one of my bullies, and guess what, they left me the fuck alone after that
[0:48:26] <%RealThiele> cause they have none
[0:48:27] <ToneBacas> that can backfire and make them want to be more powerful, and thus bigger shits and thugs
[0:48:27] <%kyh9> Local bully not so tough after getting molested
[0:48:28] <BreakerDS> And then we need to threaten that bigger threat WITH AN EVEN BIGGER THREAT
[0:48:29] <bakkatohri> all kids are cuno uwu
[0:48:30] <%tank7013> I think the plan here is to make the bullies think that everyone else has more power than them
[0:48:32] <%ScreamLord> Punch them all in the throats
[0:48:33] <mighty_fine_trousers> Is this the psychology talking? It's pretty enlightening tbh
[0:48:33] <circular7> pat is right this Time
[0:48:36] <%gitgouda> i love this chat and its child murdering ways
[0:48:40] <+Ploobie> Wrong, Most bullies come from abusive households with parents or siblings who are bullies. Them getting bullied doesn't stop their behavior.
[0:48:41] <%silvery_cricket> YOU ARE LETTING HER DOWN RIGHT NOW BY DOING A STUPID RUBE GOLBERG SHIT
[0:48:42] <%KaiserMario> How many years of psych did you do Pat? LUL
[0:48:42] <Blank9> the bullies also will have thin skin
[0:48:43] <%tank7013> Which seems... flimsy
[0:48:45] <%Undenizen> so the principle has no idea how to handle bullies?
[0:48:49] <IntrepidEye> The best way to deal with a bully is get a bigger bully to bully the bully
[0:48:49] <%silvery_cricket> INSTEAD OF PUNISHING THE BULLY
[0:48:53] <Admiral_PopnFresh> They aren't they are trying to imply that they want to empower the other kids to stand up collectively
[0:48:54] <%Raikouija> Maybe its a difference in culture with Japan vs USA?
[0:49:00] <%holydeviant1> Like half my bullies apologized the next year because a sociopath had them all by the balls
[0:49:04] <%AtomicHeartSon> AtomicHeartSon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months, currently on a 32 month streak! Hell yeah, look at that time fly. May PatStaresAt live forever. GAMER CUBE
[0:49:15] <+Havictos> oh really
[0:49:20] <%chiazam> Without the bystander effect bullies lose A LOT of power
[0:49:20] <%logoth_> ruh roh
[0:49:20] <+WaywardSera> My school tried that with one of my bullies. Their parents sued the school and got me suspended and prevented me from graduating
[0:49:22] <olm46> Bully rival found it
[0:49:23] <RyuuAoi> @holydeviant1 Lol nice

[1:07:31] <MasterTonberry23> No! Stomp their throats to be sure!
[1:07:33] <MarvelousMrD> youd be so fired after that

[1:07:39] <KingSwansJamboree> @Saltmeisterr peed his pants so bad
[1:07:42] <mike2hands> why his voice is so familiar?
[1:07:44] <Zevti> Proud of you Pat

[1:08:16] <Drunkengen> Yagami is really like Fuck Them Kids
[1:08:16] <danpc5> i imagine he does siren noises while skating

[1:09:04] <%chiazam> never challenge a yakuza protag near bikes
[1:09:08] <%chiazam> never ever ever
[1:09:12] <Sulfur_Boride> Y'know, all this skating is making want Yagami's dub actor, Greg Chun, to do a cover of Superman by Goldfinger
[1:09:14] <%shurtal> Is Yagami Japanese Francis York Morgan?

[1:10:16] <Brandon__Brando> wow this map is big
[1:10:20] <DSD24> Why would you want to fight someone on a skateboard
[1:10:20] <%MrBorisMakarov> MrBorisMakarov subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 55 months! go big number yeah
[1:10:27] <%PhantomMiG> Discourage use of guns @patstaresat  was in the description. That sound like a useful tool
[1:10:32] <ohno778> Fight the office ladies
[1:10:38] <%Dementedpenguin> @Eaglestrike117 there was actually a lengthy conversation about how he gained it too LUL
[1:10:38] <T_Sasquatch> is this that place from yakuza 5 ??
[1:10:39] <%megadblitz> @Eaglestrike117 its a PS5 the S stands for sk8t
[1:10:51] <akitanito> you deserve a treat for beating up those shit kids anyway
[1:10:52] <ohno778> Yagami is now diabetic
[1:10:54] <KingSwansJamboree> yagami needs it to fight the sugar-crazed children
[1:10:59] <circular7> we're totally back in Yakuza 7 LUL
[1:11:00] <+tigerfang86> great job pat
[1:11:02] <Crippl3> you didn't offend any sexes
[1:11:04] <+tigerfang86> you......... did it
[1:11:06] <Zombrocom> Please Skate 5
[1:11:06] <jumpyhugs> NotLikeThis
[1:11:07] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[1:11:10] <OneThousandTomatoes> good job pat
[1:11:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> A lot of sugar and Caffine says pat the red bull thing
[1:11:17] <DSD24> You sure about that
[1:11:19] <%amaranthos> Children: murdered
[1:11:19] <%DoubleRrico> is that funny?
[1:11:21] <DefaultSettiings> what sort of life do you live where thats your biggest relief today
[1:11:25] <ghosrevan> you did mess up tho
[1:11:31] <%A_Zealous_Retort> "no getting labeled as a sex offender" some days you just cant ask for more
[1:11:36] <%Raikouija> children skull caved in: Mission accomplished
[1:11:38] <DSD24> If all the bullies were in the hospital
[1:11:38] <ohno778> Can settle most things
[1:11:41] <Sulfur_Boride> So from seeing the Japanese audio of this, seems they didn't do two separate scripts for the English text in the JP and ENG audio this time.
[1:11:41] <%silvery_cricket> It would of solved it 100%
[1:11:45] <Brandon__Brando> so why dose beating them up stop them from going to the cops?
[1:11:46] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> Any day in which he’s not labeled a sex offender is a good day for Pat.
[1:11:47] <DSD24> Then no bulying would happen
[1:11:49] <+tigerfang86> what a big day
[1:11:51] <%silvery_cricket> Cant talk shit with a broken jaw
[1:11:52] <%Piemono> No they'd just start again if when they knew you wouldn't check in on them
[1:11:52] <Blank9> just reminds me of the nathan for you episode
[1:11:55] <olm46> Avoided becoming the main character of twitter.
[1:11:59] <ohno778> Kaito and his ugly ass shirts
[1:12:00] <Blank9> where he risks being a sex offender
[1:12:07] <cherrycottontail> thank god he got those speakers set up
[1:12:08] <akitanito> again?!
[1:12:10] <%chiazam> I mean once their bones mended they would just take it out on someone
[1:12:12] <+tigerfang86> DESTROY ALL BULLIES
[1:12:17] <skeletonman9000> sipsipHonk
[1:12:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Not every problem can be solved with murder just most
[1:12:19] <%notsoy> the funny thing is this would have gone exactly the same with kiryu, he just would have never bothered with the cameras in the first place
[1:12:20] <Saltmeisterr> NO BOOLI
[1:12:21] <cherrycottontail> there's NO way people would check for devices in that room that he was found in
[1:12:23] <tukds> All around the world
[1:12:23] <%Xevtes> CURE BULLYING WITH VIOLENCE
[1:12:24] <%MelBrooksKA> Guys, if we just murder all the children then they can't bully each other
[1:12:24] <Zombrocom> Chapter 13: END OF BULLY
[1:12:25] <h4nfr3d> rude
[1:12:26] <%ScreamLord> Even Cyber Bullying?
[1:12:28] <T_Sasquatch> i feel like some people in chat dont realise bullies can find kids OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL
[1:12:32] <+supersonic21> to be fair, they get an excuse for the english side of things not being super tight since they dont have that extra 6 months that the localization team used to get
[1:12:38] <%tank7013> Not being a sex offender is great I recommend it personally
[1:12:43] <%amaranthos> Remember: you're only a sex offender if you get caught hiding cameras in the bathroom
[1:12:50] <ghosrevan> something bad is going to happen
[1:12:52] <%silvery_cricket> Kiryu would of taken that brat by the back of the head and hit him against a wall until he promised to leave that kid alone
[1:12:53] <DSD24> God damn it
[1:12:55] <%Raikouija> shit kids
[1:12:55] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> Aw, shit! We gonna kill the CEO of bullying?!

[1:19:16] <Admiral_PopnFresh> PsyOps, learnable at any age
[1:19:19] <%ScreamLord> The most unrealistic thing about this is that the staff are trying to find a solution that doesn't involve punishing the victim
[1:19:21] <%silvery_cricket> This is literally going to be all undone tommorow and the bullying she will get will be worse
[1:19:26] <jumpyhugs> FUCK that phone vibration hits a pavlovian part of my brain

[1:21:00] <ohno778> HOLY FUCK
[1:21:01] <ghosrevan> maybe bullying isn't the final villan
[1:21:19] <%silvery_cricket> BUT THE BULLYING HASNT BEEN RESOLVED
[1:21:19] <%razielhex> ACAB
[1:21:22] <blastazoid00> WHAT?
[1:21:23] <Brandon__Brando> whats with this game and sex offenders?
[1:21:33] <coracor> jesus christ
[1:21:35] <studleydoorite> so he's a good guy
[1:21:38] <%Monkeyweed21> the sex offense was an alibi
[1:21:41] <akitanito> groping for alibi
[1:21:44] <+tigerfang86> fuckkkkk
[1:21:47] <Gorgs7> his alibi is groping people
[1:21:51] <%MightyDuckShoes> @Brandon__Brando Sex Offenders are really hot in Japan right now.
[1:21:54] <tanarath> I still can't believe that isn't real footage
[1:21:54] <%Undenizen> "you can't arrest me! I'm already in jail!"
[1:21:59] <ghosrevan> maybe he has a partner helping him
[1:21:59] <+tigerfang86> his alibi was comitting sex crimesz
[1:21:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> this is some 7even shit
[1:22:06] <Sulfur_Boride> His alibi is getting cancelled
[1:22:06] <+Havictos> @Brandon__Brando Sex Crime is Extremely serious problem in Japan
[1:22:08] <blackjack8182> Wait! They just abandoned the main story for like five hours for some side quest about high school bullying?
[1:22:09] <+tigerfang86> also yes ACAB
[1:22:13] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Hmm
[1:22:14] <%cvp5127> the groping was a bonus
[1:22:14] <%Xevtes> acab
[1:22:17] <%topendbuzza> ACAB
[1:22:17] <%Dementedpenguin> LUL
[1:22:17] <%ScreamLord> The Japanese Justice System actually punishing a groper on the trains is hilarious
[1:22:17] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Did you get the dude stayed in jail for 2 months before even going to trial?
[1:22:19] <coracor> oh my god
[1:22:19] <ohno778> Fuck 12
[1:22:21] <+tigerfang86> police murder???? no way that could ever happen
[1:22:24] <+chiluzza> its illegal to commit crime as a police officer
[1:22:24] <%silvery_cricket> No one gives a shit about a serial killer, help the girl being bullied
[1:22:27] <%MightyDuckShoes> He was just searching for drugs, guys
[1:22:29] <DusK_The_Stray> It was bullying all along!
[1:22:30] <T_Sasquatch> jjudgement had an amazing plot setup for everything but this is kinda nuts
[1:22:31] <+chiluzza> just look at american cops they do it all the time
[1:22:32] <+Ploobie> you ACAB people are so stupid
[1:22:32] <SquidGelatinous> The police have neeever done anything bad
[1:22:34] <%Raikouija> FINALLY REVENGE!!
[1:22:35] <%chiazam> BULLYING
[1:22:38] <+OG_M_Bison> ACAB FeelsGoodMan
[1:22:41] <%kingmemelord97> dude stright up said the guy forced his son to suicided

[1:22:50] <tanarath> BUT POLICE ARE BLESSED BY CHRISTIANITY TO NEVER EVER BE WRONG!
[1:22:52] <olm46> In America, they'd call it sus.
[1:22:53] <%ThomasOfTroy> Yes it can be
[1:22:54] <ghosrevan> BULLYING IS THE FINAL VILLAN
[1:22:55] <Brandon__Brando> @Havictos ah yes when no one is having sex. sex crime go up

[1:22:59] <PanicSwytch> Is this game just one big anti bullying psa
[1:23:00] <ohno778> @Ploobie stay mad
[1:23:06] <%kyh9> "Groping to prove your innocence"
[1:23:06] <%CodyStruggles> Sex crime as alibi. Certainly wouldn't be my first choice
[1:23:09] <%ShogunNoonto> 2 months for grab ass seems a little extreme
[1:23:11] <bakkatohri> ACAB is a-okay, because they don't test kits - they just let them pile up.
[1:23:14] <churropoppa> wut LUL
[1:23:14] <%Frodiddly> Frodiddly subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! a full year of nonsense. Cheers Patsy and babies and Paige too I guess
[1:23:20] <akitanito> and he got to cop a feel
[1:23:20] <%Mr_Pylon> and why bring up the killing in court?
[1:23:20] <%Ancopro> all the trouble of groping
[1:23:21] <%baka_sugoi> SEX CRIME
[1:23:25] <@ssjklyco> It's DOUBLE JEOPARDY
[1:23:25] <SquidGelatinous> The only thing I know is groping
[1:23:28] <PainfulAlternatingCurrent> fuck them cops hasPOGGIES
[1:23:36] <%strakillias> He knows that Japan goes horribly light on sentencing sex crimes
[1:23:40] <%blastyoboots> CAN'T allow a bad verdict to stand in JAPAN
[1:23:42] <jorniev> man i really like this lady for some reason
[1:23:43] <%OrangeMDT> Oh gosh, is this a group of adults killing their bullies, with the Chairman as the head?
[1:23:49] <Brandon__Brando> hotashiShootin
[1:23:50] <+tigerfang86> how INCREDIBLY CONVENIENT
[1:23:52] <+teh_rawk> yagami solves bullying?
[1:23:56] <+ScrapKingKeita> It's like, a $4, 500 fine and 6 month prison sentence. That's way easier than 10 years
[1:23:56] <%Monkeyweed21> this MF is just pulling a Luke Atmey
[1:24:01] <+Havictos> @ShogunNoonto Japan has a 99% conviction rate 2 months is nothing compared to what happens to other people
[1:24:07] <%silvery_cricket> Oh I fucking hate this

[1:24:20] <%polothegreatest> DL6 bullying
[1:24:21] <Profmcstevie> The full spectrum
[1:24:27] <%MidnightBurst12> Bullying has evolved
[1:24:31] <%shurtal> Cue Huey Lewis and the News!
[1:24:31] <blackjack8182> The plots just starting now!!!
[1:24:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> get one of those time speakers
[1:24:39] <%MightyDuckShoes> Ah yes. The Fly Department.
[1:24:43] <Blank9> you need to beat up the most dangerous children of all: the ones that have grown up
[1:24:45] <ohno778> If they can't get a conviction then they don't charge them
[1:24:47] <Gorgs7> Rarely stay uncovered? do they cover them back up?
[1:24:51] <+tigerfang86> @PatStaresAt random time to ask but when does this take place relative to Y7?
[1:24:56] <Sulfur_Boride> SHOCKED, you say?
[1:24:56] <%MashinChaserR> the real bully beatdown starts now
[1:25:01] <%ThomasOfTroy> WHY WOULD HE SAY THAT
[1:25:01] <OneThousandTomatoes> after
[1:25:05] <%ScreamLord> @AdeptusExterminatus When has the Japanese Justice System ever cared about train groping?
[1:25:10] <%chiazam> What Yakuza game has a longer 1st chapter because that was really long
[1:25:15] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt did they say rarely stay uncovered? did they cover them back up?
[1:25:15] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt When has the Japanese Justice System ever cared about train groping?
[1:25:17] <+ScrapKingKeita> wasn't Yakuza 7 December 2019?
[1:25:20] <+tigerfang86> rooIsee
[1:25:21] <%CopperTucker> but we literally should have beaten the children
[1:25:25] <%Piemono> The Loss of his son caused him to start train groping *sad yakuza music plays*
[1:25:26] <%topendbuzza> we in the future now
[1:25:30] <%senorpapel> I’m back, did pat kill the bullies?
[1:25:31] <+Tucker0603> is lost judgement completely different game from judgment?
[1:25:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> So Snitichban is running around?
[1:25:37] <%baka_sugoi> Imagine crossing into Ichiban on the streets
[1:25:42] <Dova573> Ichiban probably shutted in playing all the Dragon quests he missed
[1:25:45] <olm46> The devs could tell the future!?
[1:25:46] <+tigerfang86> Ichiban COULD BE around
[1:25:48] <Zevti> @doc_ock_rokc sequel
[1:25:48] <%anAngryHamster> Are Yakuza and Judgement in the same universe?
[1:25:49] <+tigerfang86> but also NOT BE around
[1:25:49] <%Dementedpenguin> @Tucker0603 it's the sequel
[1:25:51] <%LeiaSkynoober> @Tucker0603 Sequel!
[1:25:54] <Brandon__Brando> @senorpapel oh you missed a lot of good stuff you need to watch the vid

[1:26:03] <+Tucker0603> oh shit cool
[1:26:03] <Sulfur_Boride> This game's prologue was 5 hours, no? Wasn't the Great Ace Attorney's 1st chapter also like 5 hours? What's with games about lawyers taking their sweet ass time?
[1:26:03] <OneThousandTomatoes> @anangryhamster yes
[1:26:04] <tukds> Go to Ichibans house
[1:26:06] <homestylewaffles> @anAngryHamster literally the same map

[1:26:38] <Yuroshi> he really went at it
[1:26:38] <blackjack8182> @sulfur_boride It’s crazy

[1:26:44] <heli0hso> prints
[1:26:44] <mighty_fine_trousers> Who was the lady who claimed molestation?
[1:26:47] <Brandon__Brando> finger prints
[1:26:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> Butt cheese
[1:26:51] <IntrepidEye> dusted her butt for fingerprints
[1:26:51] <%MashinChaserR> grease
[1:26:52] <Dova573> omg Imagine going to Ichibans house and the door is closed but you can hear videogame music from the other side
[1:27:05] <+MrMcCrabby> She peed on his hand
[1:27:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> WAIT SHE IS JUST NOW PUTTING THE TWO TOGETHER
[1:27:11] <+tigerfang86> oh man it's actually ANCIENT BULLYING
[1:27:13] <%ScreamLord> And that's why I gropes women's utts on the train
[1:27:13] <%Xevtes> so the root of all crime is bulling
[1:27:16] <%polothegreatest> this guy just doing his work by megaphone the school problem
[1:27:21] <bakkatohri> the lady had a lot of dorito dust in her panties and they found dorito dust on the dude's hands and that's evidence
[1:27:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> WHEN HE MENTIONED IN COURT THAT THE GUY IS RELATED
[1:27:39] <%bravebravesrobin> hey Pat, how does it feel that Canadian democracy works and works to the tune of about $600 million/seat  Cheer500
[1:27:41] <tanarath> @patstaresat Fingerprinting is a VERY weird part of crimanology.
[1:27:44] <Dova573> Maybe Mikoshiba was a Kamoshida in the making
[1:27:47] <%Estuko> a word of caution, he may be a Stand user
[1:27:57] <T_Sasquatch> i feel like theres way more going in a persons life to commit suicide than just being bullied
[1:27:59] <ohno778> Every democracy works that way
[1:28:05] <%polothegreatest> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[1:28:13] <+tigerfang86> 2 dramatic weeks

[1:28:18] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> @Estuko THAT'D BE THE SICKEST TWIST
[1:28:26] <xbb1024> Democracy supports the local advertising industry
[1:28:28] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Fucking Japan
[1:28:28] <tanarath> Fingerprinting is debateably useful. fingerprints are weird and can change. they can also be planted.
[1:28:29] <Ardailec> 13 days to justice

[1:28:53] <studleydoorite> @T_Sasquatch bullying might mean more than what you think, I'm pretty sure that girl earlier was being raped and that's why they wanted her to follow them
[1:28:54] <%Dakuu75> does that include weekends?
[1:28:56] <%akscully> 99% conviction rate doesn't happen by itself
[1:28:56] <OneThousandTomatoes> better than ace attorney where cases were only 3 days long max
[1:28:57] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt also if you win a defense case the prosecution can freely appeal for a retrial
[1:28:57] <BrickleBork> 13 organization memebers
[1:28:57] <ghosrevan> Japan justice system baby
[1:28:59] <%baka_sugoi> dang

[2:23:59] <churropoppa> David Jaffe has joined the chat
[2:23:59] <%Deekman> Listen to this Persona track
[2:24:00] <+ScrapKingKeita> To be fair, the first Yakuza game was also a lot more serious than the others
[2:24:00] <%DianaTheAscian> A LITTLE
[2:24:00] <%SirGO0SE> Jebaited
[2:24:01] <+sund0wner> Forever

[2:24:23] <circular7> judgement 1 was more serious
[2:24:23] <@ssjklyco> Is the game gonna end with you being the Advisor for all the clubs?
[2:24:24] <%Undenizen> well, now you literally don't need the mystery club
[2:24:25] <+spacepiratezod> YAKUZA IS A SERIES SERIOUS -literally first thing you do in Zero is  karaoke
[2:24:27] <%MightyDuckShoes> These children are dangerously impressionable.
[2:24:28] <willyfreshness> Always trust guys in leather jackets
[2:24:29] <%madmanrambler> @kyh9 I presume yakuza 7 was persona 6?
[2:24:36] <%castlerock42> Remember the dead body at the beginning? The plot sure doesn't.
[2:24:38] <%MrBorisMakarov> it is Sega I guess
[2:24:39] <OtakuSnake1> But you did a cool flip, that makes you trustworthy
[2:24:41] <%DianaTheAscian> Persona 7 was Yakuza 7
[2:24:46] <%chiazam> What about the sugar baby?
[2:24:47] <%akscully> can't wait until yagami has to beat the shit out of a rival dance advisor
[2:24:48] <%kyh9> @madmanrambler Yes.

[2:26:12] <%tank7013> @castlerock42 I wouldn't want it any other way
[2:26:17] <bakkatohri> Nobody gets this good just reading novels. She must be doing other stuff on her off time.
[2:26:26] <%madmanrambler> 'you went into a fucking dance club and gave them a new routine?'
[2:26:28] <%DianaTheAscian> I'll be sad if shes not a protag one day
[2:26:31] <cthulu_fearlock> She's been pulling the strings the whole time
[2:26:33] <%castlerock42> @tank7013 After that dance, me neither.

[3:12:21] <%baka_sugoi> BODY
[3:12:23] <%strakillias> Thats gonna be the guy who joins your team when hes fired for working the case too hard. Calling it now
[3:12:23] <%CodyStruggles> Probably a shit kid parent
[3:12:25] <cherrycottontail> "That guy looks like he beat up a bunch of children recently, I should look into that."
[3:12:27] <+Havictos> This chapter starts side quests right?
[3:12:28] <%kingmemelord97> hey pat how much longer you gonna go ?
[3:12:30] <Sulfur_Boride> Quite generous that they have these recaps every chapter, probably b/c they expect you to get lost in all the side content
[3:12:30] <bakkatohri> That fly detail is still impressive
[3:12:36] <%megadblitz> who's narrating?
[3:12:42] <%baka_sugoi> DON DON
[3:12:42] <%blankwaffle> is this just detective Conan?

[3:13:07] <$thomassolorio> a yen coin obviously
[3:13:08] <+ScrapKingKeita> It refers to Light And Shadow, which when they meet, creates a Grey Zone
[3:13:10] <@ssjklyco> Sex crimes

[3:13:13] <%amaranthos> bjorke bjorke
[3:13:20] <h0wiewong> Nah, just a fact to establish that one goon was an asshole
[3:13:25] <%baka_sugoi> HAND HOLDING IS A CRIME
[3:13:41] <%silvery_cricket> Like teenage girls were getting raped
[3:13:50] <%silvery_cricket> probably should deal with that
[3:13:52] <%polothegreatest> lewd
[3:14:05] <+RoByte2> To be fair you could only charge a few of those students with attempted murder
[3:14:09] <ohno778> well he had it coming sounds like

[3:15:29] <Zombrocom> YEAH WE JUST KINDA BRUSHED PAST THE FACT THAT KID WAS SELLING GIRLS INTO SEX SLAVERY
[3:15:31] <%GuilKato> @amaranthos you would never murder them, but you would pick them up and throw them into things
[3:15:37] <blackjack8182> KIRYU NEVER KILLED ANYONE
[3:15:46] <%amaranthos> Or throw them out the window
[3:15:46] <Zombrocom> You would think that would kinda be a big deal
[3:15:50] <%silvery_cricket> @daisymaisy02 A underage sex slave ring being run by a 16 year old pimp, who gave teenage girls to a local gang.
[3:15:51] <daisymaisy02> SORRY WAIT A STUDENT WAS DOING WHAT
[3:15:52] <%DianaTheAscian> oh that cop is prob related to the girl
[3:16:00] <Ardailec> @daisymaisy02 Basketball gang senpai evidently had a thing with the Liumong. He "recruits" girls for them, he gets their clout
[3:16:03] <ohno778> didnt kiryu kill two tigers in 2?
[3:16:04] <daisymaisy02> @silvery_cricket UHHHHHH
[3:16:05] <%baka_sugoi> BAD TOUCH
[3:16:15] <%polothegreatest> NEVER, KIRYU IS A SAINT
[3:16:19] <+HuoShengdi> the pimp is a 3rd year so he's 17 or 18
[3:16:22] <%silvery_cricket> @daisymaisy02 Yes and the story does not care, that was a side note
[3:16:27] <daisymaisy02> And that was just a side story or smth????????????
[3:16:29] <$thomassolorio> @blackjack8182 or used a man as a human shield
[3:16:46] <shinbuya> its mah job to know you derp
[3:16:48] <%DianaTheAscian> ITS HIS JOB
[3:16:51] <%silvery_cricket> @daisymaisy02 NO THAT WAS A MINOR DETAIL IN THE MAIN STORY
[3:16:52] <h0wiewong> @daisymaisy02 Kinda just used it to establish that one kid was an asshole
[3:16:58] <@Spydurman> but the body was rotting??? Doesn't that mean it was there for a while
[3:16:59] <blackjack8182> @thomassolorio Or blew up a helicopter
[3:17:14] <%tank7013> Yea the series glosses over sex slavery all the time. It's like the RGG team's version of a Jojo character killing a dog
[3:17:27] <ohno778> HMMMMMMMM
[3:17:50] <mighty_fine_trousers> Yeah but your complacency in all this isn't helping either lady
[3:17:52] <%tank7013> It's how you know they're evil
[3:17:55] <%silvery_cricket> @daisymaisy02 This teacher keeps saying he doesn't belong here, and is just a massive bitch. Even though he has been here one day and broke up a sex slave ring. BUT NO HE DOESNT BELONG
[3:18:01] <%notsoy> that would be peak RGG lmao
[3:18:02] <+Tucker0603> she was banging the son?

[3:18:18] <niko_fredman> .....THIS SOUND LIKE TRAP
[3:18:19] <h0wiewong> Now to be fair, you're here putting up cams and beating up students
[3:18:20] <+tigerfang86> WHOOOO HATE DAE
[3:18:21] <Zombrocom> 16 year old kid faked his own death and became a secret vigilante in the shadows?

[3:19:44] <%bevyrage> @silvery_cricket it's quite likely something to come up later down the line. murder and bullying are more important

[3:55:16] <willyfreshness> said 7
[3:55:17] <+ScrapKingKeita> BUT YOU CRIED FOR DAIGO
[3:55:17] <artoflec> 6 is definitely better than 5 in terms of its main story content
[3:55:24] <%sporeian94> I was gonna say the only person I've ever heard hate on 7 was wolf
[3:55:25] <vonmaultke> 7 was fantastic
[3:55:25] <willyfreshness> 7 rules
[3:55:25] <%greasypete00> good i thought 7 was great
[3:55:26] <@Ranryu692> I hope Yagami's replacement will be a more interesting character
[3:55:27] <%Deekman> I agree. I’ve been reviewing these since 3 and they just keep getting better. Besides 6
[3:55:27] <+PettyFunk> Whew that's a relief LUL
[3:55:27] <%polothegreatest> LUL LUL
[3:55:28] <h0wiewong> Ahhh 6, also known as the first test of the Dragon Engine
[3:55:28] <bakkatohri> Arguably all kiwami games are also missteps, too.
[3:55:30] <Ner234> YOU DIDD
[3:55:33] <CaptainBright> YOU DID
[3:55:36] <%Monkeyweed21> THE MARK II PAT
[3:55:36] <%castlerock42> You totally did.
[3:55:36] <@ssjklyco> Crygo
[3:55:37] <%TheMoenia> i really like 6 to be honest
[3:55:41] <%shurtal> Theres video
[3:55:42] <@Spydurman> LIKE A BABY
[3:55:42] <+supersonic21> 6 has that bad ass legends of the deep game though
[3:55:45] <willyfreshness> YOU LOVE DAIGO
[3:55:50] <%MugenSandan> Patrick "Totally cried for Daigo" Boivin
[3:55:51] <Madinki> YOU DID AND YOU CAN'T DENY IT
[3:55:54] <%greasypete00> i was very worried yo u were unforgiveably wrong
[3:55:54] <+izanagi22> Oh no that's at the school
[3:55:55] <Sulfur_Boride> I like the dichotomy b/w Ichiban, the DUMBEST motherfucker we've had as an MC, and Yagami, the most educated (supposedly) MC in these games.
[3:55:57] <%SirGO0SE> he totally did i was here
[3:55:57] <%Deekman> I also dislike 7. Mirror face fucking killed me and broke the series
[3:55:59] <SomeAsianDood> Those were some manly tears for Daigo
[3:56:07] <+supersonic21> thats a fucking goose bumps refrance
[3:56:09] <+supersonic21> holy shit
[3:56:11] <SquidGelatinous> This game will end with Yagami writing a heartfelt letter to Daigo too
[3:56:16] <ohno778> body model?
[3:56:18] <%tank7013> Damn
[3:56:22] <%rbakervv> @PatStaresAt side quest at bulletin board

[3:56:32] <@ssjklyco> That's game changer
[3:56:33] <+crovvv> I'm gonna miss the turn based fights, not a big fan of the fighting in Yakuza games.
[3:56:34] <%notsoy> lol mirror face isn't even close to the dumbest twist in the series

[3:56:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> the skying isnt set up here
[3:56:55] <%notsoy> bro these are spinoffs, the ichiban games are going to remain RPGs
[3:56:59] <OneThousandTomatoes> spying*

[3:58:39] <%SirGO0SE> yagumi looks like he punch kick real good
[3:58:50] <%BinaryFireball> just waiting for that random difficulty spike that will force you to grind for like 3 hours

[3:59:47] <%athuramn> that difficulty spike usually happens after he starts a business or enterprise no?
[4:00:06] <%Deekman> I only played the tutorial dice n cube and from that 1 round I made 100,000 yen

[4:02:21] <%castlerock42> What is even the point of Yagami's belt?
[4:02:40] <%TheMoenia> i kinda ruined yakuza 6 for myself with the full yakuza training gear outfit
[4:02:40] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:03:13] <Blank9> yagami's jacket being so short drives me crazy
[4:03:39] <%TheMoenia> lots of kiryu gasping for breath every 10 steps
[4:03:42] <+PettyFunk> Looks like it may be straps from the leather jacket, not a loose belt
[4:03:44] <SquidGelatinous> The training gear outfit makes Kiryu's model cry in every scene involving Daigo
[4:03:44] <@Spydurman> I feel the ship ruins 6 enough LUL

[4:12:12] <OneThousandTomatoes> literally running in circles
[4:12:13] <%notsoy> yes, only at the start
