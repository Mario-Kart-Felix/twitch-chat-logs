[0:28:56] <%SuckerPunchSyd> “dont play on the big tv”
[0:28:57] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt Since you said that the ending to ME3 retroactively ruined the whole trilogy, wouldn't you consider yourself going through this series again a waste of time?
[0:28:57] <%Ipsenscastle> Playing as Geth was rad
[0:28:59] <Mattais88> Volus biotic god
[0:29:00] <+ThomasOfTroy> Soft serve
[0:29:01] <%Monkeyweed21> @BallerSwagBro9k Tales of Berseria is better than Last of Us 2

[0:29:03] <%peachy996> Geth Primes, they are chunky bois

[0:36:39] <Profmcstevie> Roll dice to see if you sense the monsters
[0:36:39] <+SinnerEbru> good
[0:36:39] <%kyh9> I just bring Javik to everything
[0:36:42] <%Ches_Neckbeard> Liara and Garrus? that doesn't sound like Javik
[0:36:42] <%Treasure_Vault> It's kinda stupid that the game needs that
[0:36:43] <%peachy996> Javik is more entertaining on Surkesh
[0:36:43] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Best order of ME
[0:36:44] <IvanMistwalker> Javik
[0:36:44] <%Monkeyweed21> Javik has better dialogue
[0:36:45] <+SinnerEbru> as you should
[0:36:47] <%andrewofbob> Are we getting James Vega - TECH EXPERT?
[0:36:47] <+vaderxyz1970> Link the list?
[0:36:47] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Make a save first, and bring javik then reload
[0:36:47] <%jillyrancher> theres a Bloodborne board game
[0:36:47] <%peachy996> Fuck liara
[0:36:48] <%InternetShis> Liara specifically
[0:36:50] <heartlesshealer> good list
[0:36:50] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Smurt
[0:36:53] <dawarw0lf> As the guide says any members are good for any mission
[0:36:53] <%Alig200> Sur'Kesh, in case you wanted the proper spelling
[0:36:54] <%NopeBadguy> Basically, bring ME1 chars to the ME1 missions
[0:36:55] <tattleworm> javik's got some good stuff on surkesh, yeah
[0:36:56] <IvanMistwalker> JAVIK
[0:36:56] <+dd44dostivei> nahhh you want to bring javik, i think
[0:36:57] <bahookery> cheers pat
[0:36:57] <%LumberjackJack> Javik instead of Liara is also ok
[0:37:01] <justdealingwithit> Javik always
[0:37:02] <slix3431> PAT
[0:37:02] <heartlesshealer> bring Javik for maximum racism
[0:37:03] <dawarw0lf> Choose what you want
[0:37:05] <TourettesPlays> Sir Cash
[0:37:06] <%Monkeyweed21> Javik and Garrus have the best dialogue on Surkesh
[0:37:06] <bahookery> How's the Mass Effecting 3: Tokyo Drift
[0:37:08] <GustauveVIII> liara and garrus have like two funny lines
[0:37:08] <%ahomeschooldropout> There's also a fun dialog with Javik where he talks about eating Salarians
[0:37:09] <DatAsuna> I'd go liara and javik yeah
[0:37:11] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Save the game before going to serkesh bring javik, then reload
[0:37:11] <%shadowsofpain> Nah, Liara and Garrus is great
[0:37:11] <%AmericanSkidd> Surkesh was the mission you play in the Demo btw
[0:37:14] <dawarw0lf> It’s always the right choic
[0:37:16] <%Scevda> Javik is prettt active on surkesh so@meh.
[0:37:18] <%peachy996> Yeah that's this stream
[0:37:20] <Mattais88> Next stroy mission
[0:37:21] <dekkitout> Javik is the arbiter of spacism
[0:37:22] <GustauveVIII> javik has great lines the entire beginning
[0:37:25] <%castlerock42> Javik's great for multiple jokes. Liara and Garrus is one solid joke.
[0:37:26] <%Ipsenscastle> I'd take Javik & Garrus for sure
[0:37:27] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Soon TM?
[0:37:27] <%miguelrod777> surkesh is great
[0:37:28] <%Solid_Stro> God, these people and their guides for the “Best Experience” is some shit
[0:37:30] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Bring EDI or Garrus to Grissom Academy for unique dialogue
[0:37:36] <%peachy996> Yeah do that Hanar
[0:37:40] <heartlesshealer> Soon™
[0:37:41] <@MistyMntns> Gun
[0:37:43] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I can never remember who I brought where
[0:37:43] <%Scevda> Sir Kesh
[0:37:47] <Profmcstevie> The nuclear one
[0:37:47] <%andrewofbob> We haven't really got the any of the new weapomns
[0:37:48] <%aWanderingKaivo> geth shotty is back in ME3
[0:37:53] <%kyh9> KISHOCK BROS
[0:37:53] <dekkitout> Not the nuke gun?
[0:37:53] <%AmericanSkidd> its pretty good not gonna lie
[0:37:53] <%jillyrancher> surkesh has great music
[0:37:54] <%thelaxinator> I like that shotgun that says it would break the arm of an average human.
[0:37:57] <@BallerSwagBro9k> Wait till u see the Scorpion
[0:38:00] <%NopeBadguy> The Hattock is still the best AR in the game
[0:38:00] <+athuramn> LUL
[0:38:02] <willyfreshness> I brought Javik to everything just to hear his prothean perspective
[0:38:03] <%Monkeyweed21> Geth Sniper is even better imo
[0:38:03] <%Garthunox> Carnifex handcannon
[0:38:04] <%Dakuu75> god damn it... that was a good one
[0:38:05] <dawarw0lf> @solid_stro The guide he has is probably the best
[0:38:06] <%kyh9> KISHOCK HARPOON BROS
[0:38:07] <DatAsuna> turns out LE has a couple of extra save import bugs so there'll probably be several things that aren't how pat picked it
[0:38:09] <%kyh9> WHERE WE AT
[0:38:09] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Liara and her monotone bullshit can fuck right off
[0:38:10] <IvanMistwalker> the scorpion is good
[0:38:12] <%peachy996> @jillyrancher I'd go with Edi since Pat didn't romance Garrus
[0:38:13] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I like the Venom shotgun
[0:38:15] <@Mikewrobe> yea garrus is so broken
[0:38:17] <%jillyrancher> you wont get it for a while unfortunately
[0:38:17] <%LumberjackJack> ASCEND GARRUS
[0:38:21] <TourettesPlays> @SaphronBlackbourne i did a genocide run of ME2 so I have to take James and Liara on every mission LUL LUL
[0:38:22] <bahookery> Death God Garrus build
[0:38:25] <%Retinolgaming> AR build garrus is freaking crazy.
[0:38:26] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> Godrrus
[0:38:27] <+vaderxyz1970> Aimbot Garrus build
[0:38:27] <%Monkeyweed21> Garrus can solo the entire game on Insanity
[0:38:33] <heartlesshealer> psaGiefrail Zzz

[0:38:51] <+sonofthedeepsouth> NAH
[0:38:52] <Apolar_> I had a bug when doing the Hanar mission, one of the things wouldn't show up. Had to use a save editor
[0:38:52] <Dunmarkh> no guarantees

[0:38:59] <%peachy996> I just like talking shit
[0:38:59] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Yes
[0:39:00] <DatAsuna> Garrus benefits from Bioware not differentiating base and total damage, while having amplifying multipliers
[0:39:00] <dekkitout> Telling Pat he sold Ratslayer is fun tho
[0:39:01] <28moogles> One video blows up and now it's an entire playthrough of people screaming to do the meme Garrus build they all just found out about.

[0:39:10] <heartlesshealer> Only if paige comforts you after cry
[0:39:10] <+vaderxyz1970> What's Masochism vicariously?
[0:39:10] <%jillyrancher> @peachy996 Well Garrus has something to say to the return of *Redacted for Spoilers*
[0:39:12] <@BallerSwagBro9k> Don't backsest just point and laugh at Pat Kappa
[0:39:13] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> Garrus becomes your mobile turret if you build him that way.
[0:39:15] <%Pukenasty> now i kinda want to backseat Kappa
[0:39:15] <%Ravioli_Ronin> That wasn’t backseating, that was punching the driver and attempting to grab the wheel Kappa
[0:39:18] <%MidnightBurst12> ???
[0:39:19] <%AmericanSkidd> There is a difference between backseating and BAD backseating
[0:39:19] <@tizz86> backseating wil earn my ire, that shit's annoying
[0:39:19] <%Solid_Stro> @dawarw0lf I’m sure his guide is fine, but the constant “Make sure to do this” from the chat is annoying as hell c4sageLUL
[0:39:22] <heartlesshealer> aftercare is important
[0:39:22] <+sonofthedeepsouth> I came here to laugh at you
[0:39:23] <DatAsuna> There's a reason other RPGs don't have raw stackable bonuses like this does
[0:39:26] <Dunmarkh> what?
[0:39:32] <%Dopamien> wtf I live for streamer suffering. Why would I help pat DansGame
[0:39:35] <IvanMistwalker> sleepy Gief
[0:39:36] <%miguelrod777> ted
[0:39:37] <%Rumbutt> But Paaat, just play the game the way I want you to play it( also ignore the way the other 766 people in chat want you to play it they're WRONG)
[0:39:39] <heartlesshealer> ?
[0:39:41] <DatAsuna> cause the math gets crazy
[0:39:44] <Sp3ctre48> what
[0:39:45] <%peachy996> @jillyrancher Ahh. I figured it was what the lady says later

[0:39:50] <dekkitout> tajWHY
[0:39:51] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Boo
[0:39:51] <%Treuan> I get it
[0:39:51] <%thelaxinator> In an alternate Universe somewhere, Garrus didn't turn down the spectre candidacy and just became Shepard.
[0:39:51] <@MistyMntns> BOOO
[0:39:52] <+JaseAdrift> BOOOOO
[0:39:53] <%Mikewrobe> thats big

[0:40:24] <%Mikewrobe> oh wait i am unmodded
[0:40:24] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Pat you gotta read chat’s mind and go to Gus Grissom academy ASAP psaGoblin
[0:40:25] <Profmcstevie> Spite
[0:40:25] <dawarw0lf> @solid_stro It’s just that there is a lot you can miss with ME3 if you don’t know about it all and the dlc are weird to place in the main game.
[0:40:25] <%LumberjackJack> Hi, I'm not a mod :)
[0:40:25] <%ComfortableStranger> MIND BLOWN

[0:41:05] <%ComfortableStranger> pat you never catch my bad jokes
[0:41:05] <%twistedj3ster> you would breed super jokes
[0:41:06] <stantheman_97> awful
[0:41:06] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> I see pat screaming
[0:41:06] <%castlerock42> It would be an empty chat.
[0:41:07] <penitentpendant> Depends on the person that's timed out
[0:41:08] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> We are pretty unfunny as is
[0:41:08] <@goose_attack_almanac> Depends on if they're in on it
[0:41:09] <robosqueeb> theres no humor here already
[0:41:09] <+JaseAdrift> The funniest chat
[0:41:09] <%kyh9> The Kamiya Effect
[0:41:09] <28moogles> Most jokes are bad.
[0:41:09] <@commanderclaw> Even good comedians make bad jokes sometimes
[0:41:10] <%andrewofbob> Hyper try-hard comedians or gtfo
[0:41:11] <%LumberjackJack> It would be the collection of the worst dad jokes ever
[0:41:12] <%aWanderingKaivo> people would compete for timeouts lets be real
[0:41:13] <%ArchimerCXV> without bad jokes we'd have nothing to do
[0:41:17] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[0:41:17] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> The jokes would probably be really high-quality
[0:41:17] <GustauveVIII> anarchist or fascist chat?
[0:41:18] <brisk_dacat> I remember being a mod. And then the fire nation attacked.
[0:41:18] <dawarw0lf> The Doug doug streams can be dumb funny sometimes
[0:41:18] <Profmcstevie> Nobody speaks
[0:41:19] <%kyh9> Tell good jokes in English, Kamiya laughs and blocks you
[0:41:20] <%thelaxinator> please stop talking about my life
[0:41:20] <@TheYellowcouch> Oh no that's me
[0:41:21] <JetpackMcQuack> More, shittier jokes
[0:41:23] <karovus> getting timed out for telling a bad joke would be the best reward
[0:41:23] <Daxalog> Humorless and dry
[0:41:24] <heartlesshealer> Depends on how long the joke bans are
[0:41:24] <%Axellogic> If you time me out I become a grumpy baby who wont chat anymore. *hardly chats*
[0:41:25] <%Dopamien> what no? timing people out for 10 seconds is great
[0:41:25] <%Deano8817> last time I paid money to tell you a joke you thought I actually got in a coma so
[0:41:25] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> I hate comedy! We all do!
[0:41:27] <%Rumbutt> Alright but people looking to get the 30 second time out would totally be a thing
[0:41:28] <%SaiyanShoto> I know my jokes suck
[0:41:28] <DracaenaLeaf> being witty is hard :(
[0:41:29] <%General_Terro> the funniest joke is there was no joke
[0:41:29] <choocheess> i think it'd be a cutthroat funny chat that's like a toxic comedy club from the early 90's
[0:41:31] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Hate Em
[0:41:32] <penitentpendant> Credit to chat for all the rock puns during Grime
[0:41:33] <@tizz86> water cooler jokes
[0:41:35] <%Scevda> It would be made into a competition.
[0:41:35] <%SuckerPunchSyd> See I’m the opposite
[0:41:35] <%Solid_Stro> Tell a joke at your own risk
[0:41:36] <@Lion_kun> Getting timed out for a bad joke should be a mark of pride.
[0:41:37] <%peachy996> Life is the joke.
[0:41:39] <%Kemmybelle> schrodinger mod

[0:41:51] <+sonofthedeepsouth> DO IT NOW
[0:41:51] <%walternatorz> when in doubt, mod it out
[0:41:52] <%AmericanSkidd> The Chat Class War is never over
[0:41:52] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> What if we bet money on which mod wins an argument
[0:41:52] <%NopeBadguy> it's called moderator, not extremeist
[0:41:54] <JetpackMcQuack> what is the exact opposite of the intented effect
[0:41:56] <%TheotherKristian> FUCK YOU Jimmu
[0:41:57] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LET THE BLOOD FLOW
[0:42:02] <%thelaxinator> The key to being funny seems to be to try to be unfunny
[0:42:03] <+Dova573> For a second I thougt pats shirt was an onlyfans tshirt
[0:42:03] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt How are your Great Ace Attorney and Stories 2 playthroughs going? I'm curious.

[0:42:29] <%Dopamien> Real chaos is when we can time people out with bits caleb3 caleb4

[0:48:11] <@goose_attack_almanac> Ross and Rachel are both terrible people
[0:48:12] <marvel877> And then Joey told him to use lotion and baby powder
[0:48:13] <hereiam407> Friends is fine
[0:48:13] <%GalacticaPhanto> Friends is whack
[0:48:15] <28moogles> I watched that shit when I was like 11
[0:48:17] <PMda2nd> @ravioli_ronin not that hot
[0:48:17] <+tinytinykittycat> I never watched friends and I learned that shit through osmosis
[0:48:18] <%peachy996> Phoebe turned into a massive bitch as the show went on
[0:48:19] <@DakotaMacDoodle> Remember when Ross was a Monster and still is!
[0:48:20] <%JamesCorck> He looked like he just sploded in jizz lol
[0:48:20] <+ThomasOfTroy> Ross was on a date, and used powder in his date's bathroom
[0:48:21] <Sp3ctre48> Everyone hates Ross
[0:48:21] <@Lion_kun> Chandler>Joey>Monica>>>>>>>Rachel=Ross>>>>Phoebe
[0:48:22] <%Ches_Neckbeard> should've just set Ross on fire. Friends would've improved with some immolation
[0:48:23] <SovPho> phoebe's hot
[0:48:24] <%saiko2208> Im black...I didn't watch friends
[0:48:25] <robosqueeb> she had a smelly cat
[0:48:25] <hereiam407> They all lie to each other all the time
[0:48:26] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Joey was best Guy
[0:48:26] <%JamesCorck> Phoebe with the musket.
[0:48:27] <%peachy996> She was fine at the beginning
[0:48:28] <+BigBlackBankai> Phoebe is the second best one.
[0:48:28] <%castlerock42> Friends sounds less and less real to me over the years.
[0:48:28] <+toastybites> They all went crazy after Season 4
[0:48:28] <GustauveVIII> friends was a good show whose cast is unreasonably wealthy for the jobs that they have
[0:48:30] <%Ravioli_Ronin> “Waaaaaah I’m a paleontologist waaaahhhhh we were on a break”
[0:48:32] <+dd44dostivei> i liked the monkey in the first season
[0:48:32] <%shadowsofpain> Joey was great
[0:48:33] <%JamesCorck> Remember Phoebe with the musket?
[0:48:35] <@Lion_kun> I am going to get unmodded again for hating Phoebe lol
[0:48:35] <%LumberjackJack> Agreed
[0:48:35] <+DarkShadow124> Monica is the hottest tho
[0:48:36] <%AmericanSkidd> Phoebe is a loveable freak
[0:48:36] <YamadaZero> I liked Chandler.
[0:48:37] <28moogles> Yes, that is the show.
[0:48:39] <%bassoontyphoon> Phoebe is the only good one
[0:48:39] <%GalacticaPhanto> If I wanted to see dumb white people in NY I'd take a train uptown
[0:48:40] <marvel877> Phoebe didn't believe in evolution.
[0:48:40] <%peachy996> Then she turns into all the other selfish assholes
[0:48:41] <OldManDeckardCain> phoebe is basically aerith in final fantasy 7 remake
[0:48:43] <+luketrapwalker> Ross was a dick
[0:48:44] <%JamesCorck> Monica was insufferable, tho.
[0:48:45] <%SaiyanShoto> Phoebe to me seemed like she was just being weird to get attention
[0:48:46] <%twistedj3ster> yeah
[0:48:47] <BackflipCharm> Phoebe and Joey are the only charming characters in that show
[0:48:48] <%Scevda> You WOULD paige
[0:48:49] <%Ipsenscastle> @Lion_kun I'll actually agree with that list
[0:48:50] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> friends is fast-food television from the previous age of entertainment
[0:48:50] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Kick Ross in the shins
[0:48:51] <+vaderxyz1970> Who's the one that through away the winning lotto ticket?
[0:48:52] <%peachy996> I liked Chandler.
[0:48:52] <choocheess> I feel like out of all the women on that show the actress that played phoebe made it out with her dignity intact
[0:48:52] <@Lion_kun> Phoebe is way worse than Ross.
[0:48:53] <hereiam407> pearson
[0:48:53] <@DakotaMacDoodle> Ross is very punchable
[0:48:54] <YamadaZero> Chandler was great.
[0:48:54] <%JamesCorck> Naaah, Monica was way worse than Rachel.
[0:48:55] <TheAntiNihilist> Ross the psycho
[0:48:56] <@tizz86> chandler was probably the realest
[0:48:58] <%RealThiele> punch his face in
[0:48:59] <+ThomasOfTroy> Monica needs to eat a fucking hamburger and Chandler needs to do less coke
[0:48:59] <+BigBlackBankai> Worst to best: Ross, Rachel, Monica, Joey, Phoebe, Chandler.
[0:49:00] <%kingofasgard> jennifer aniston tho
[0:49:00] <%TheCynicalSeth> Phoebe was just as selfish and also crazy
[0:49:01] <jbrachob> ross is a shithead
[0:49:01] <$realm_forge> That’s just David shwimmer
[0:49:03] <heartlesshealer> pearson
[0:49:06] <@goose_attack_almanac> Ross is pathetic. Rachel is fucking malicious
[0:49:07] <%AmericanSkidd> Chandler is surprisingly well adjusted
[0:49:07] <kikoeru_san> there's an old After Hours episode about how EVERY one of them are shitty people
[0:49:07] <rekinom> okay but they were on a break
[0:49:09] <Mattais88> Did you hear that Jennifer Aniston eats a single M&M to de-stress
[0:49:11] <brisk_dacat> Watch Living Single friends is trash 🗑
[0:49:11] <%shadowsofpain> That dude ate Ross's sandwich and that was a bummer
[0:49:12] <@Lion_kun> Phoebe tried to steal a girl's cat because she thought her dead mom was in the cat.
[0:49:12] <+dd44dostivei> paige has never watched friends
[0:49:13] <%peachy996> If I could just hang out with Chandler and Joey, I would
[0:49:15] <marvel877> I don't know man, Chandler was always a cynical dick.
[0:49:15] <SummonerMagno> phoebe is the worst of them all
[0:49:16] <%hatok> pat please tell my sister who doesn't know what Twitch is to not name her new kitten "Rachel Green"
[0:49:18] <jbrachob> NOPE
[0:49:20] <%Solid_Stro> I’ll shove Ross in a locker if I ever saw him
[0:49:21] <%Alig200> @Mattais88 wtf
[0:49:24] <hereiam407> Do you remember the season where chandler gained 60 lbs and was sweaty and red all the time?
[0:49:25] <jbrachob> They were on a break
[0:49:28] <%bassoontyphoon> How is phoebe the worst
[0:49:28] <+JaseAdrift> this is friends...they are all mostly bad
[0:49:29] <%Ches_Neckbeard> Paige lied and she has watched Friends
[0:49:32] <%JamesCorck> I used to hate Chandler, and then I grew up and turned into Chandler, as punishment.
[0:49:33] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt How did those people afford the rent for their rooms with the shitty jobs they had at the beginning?
[0:49:36] <%AmericanSkidd> that was really bad
[0:49:36] <@DakotaMacDoodle> Joey is sleazy but with a heart of gold
[0:49:38] <peyodogo> theres a rumor goin around that jennifer aniston and david schwimmer are dating now, good for em if so but lmao
[0:49:38] <@Lion_kun> Phoebe is a creationist and mocked Ross's job as a paleontologist.

[0:51:14] <%JamesCorck> Joey's got your back.
[0:51:20] <%RealThiele> chandler has no soul left from cube work
[0:51:20] <hereiam407> Chandler would pay his rent
[0:51:23] <theanora1> Chandler is rich AF though
[0:51:23] <%SaiyanShoto> boppidy boopty
[0:51:24] <%shurtal> Chandler is steady income
[0:51:26] <@Lion_kun> But Joey will bring in more hot chicks to make you feel insecure.
[0:51:26] <+luketrapwalker> Joey is the best
[0:51:29] <%AmericanSkidd> yeah he did
[0:51:29] <%Zaktheaussie> He did
[0:51:30] <%Ipsenscastle> Chandler would lend you money
[0:51:30] <+ThomasOfTroy> Joey was literally molested as a kid
[0:51:30] <%peachy996> Chandler will hel pay the rent though
[0:51:32] <@tizz86> yep
[0:51:32] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[0:51:33] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> Joey WAS my roommate for freshman year of college
[0:51:33] <%JamesCorck> Joey's that one friend we all wanted to be with when things go to shit.
[0:51:36] <%peachy996> He did Paige
[0:51:38] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Chandler complaining about copy writing
[0:51:39] <Sp3ctre48> Yes and they started dating and it was real weird
[0:51:41] <@Lion_kun> Also Chandler has more money.
[0:51:42] <%kingofasgard> but chandler would tell you the game was rigged from the start
[0:51:43] <marvel877> He did
[0:51:45] <%aWanderingKaivo> the Triumvirate
[0:51:52] <%CoffeeKaiju> yall this stream is so weird
[0:51:53] <+sonofthedeepsouth> AW SIBLING MOMENT
[0:51:53] <Profmcstevie> 125?!
[0:51:55] <secret_npc> Living with a semi-successful actor would be tight cause they'd never be around
[0:51:58] <Hanzmolman> Pat is Monica
[0:51:59] <%shadowsofpain> Chandler would pay for just about everything though
[0:51:59] <+ThomasOfTroy> @kingofasgard Why would you do this
[0:52:02] <%jillyrancher> I liked Seinfeld more than Friends tbh
[0:52:03] <hereiam407> Isn
[0:52:03] <+sonofthedeepsouth> ACTUALLY WHOLESOME
[0:52:06] <zanzibarian_hamster> cynics shouldn't hang out, it creates a recursive feedback loop that can only end in a knife fight
[0:52:10] <%JamesCorck> This is a "Friends" stream now, holyshit what a good show that was.
[0:52:10] <%AmericanSkidd> wow
[0:52:11] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Wow
[0:52:12] <drawerinkshow> Damn
[0:52:13] <hereiam407> Isn't Mass Effect just space Friends?
[0:52:14] <@BallerSwagBro9k> HOW?
[0:52:14] <marvel877> Thanks to the COVID, I've been watching reruns of FRIENDS on TBS every other day.
[0:52:15] <Saffry_Ruzin> Ain't that a kick in the head?
[0:52:15] <%thelaxinator> I do that in the simpsons, but in later seasons the intro is completely nonsequitor
[0:52:16] <%Ravioli_Ronin> My brother and I do that with Curb LUL
[0:52:18] <%Ipsenscastle> I love that I started this weird ten-minute tangent by joking about shit forming a paste
[0:52:18] <@Lion_kun> Joey was doing pretty well for himself until he fell down an elevator shaft.
[0:52:19] <%jillyrancher> Seinfeld's great
[0:52:19] <Mattais88> I could do that with the classic simpsons
[0:52:19] <%JamesCorck> "Friends" was great, I miss watching that show.
[0:52:20] <%shadowsofpain> That's surprisingly wholesome
[0:52:20] <heartlesshealer> wow
[0:52:21] <%castlerock42> Damn. Respect.
[0:52:22] <+dd44dostivei> simpsons still god-tier
[0:52:23] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> @Profmcstevie My first donation and I've been watching since 2011.
[0:52:27] <%Solid_Stro> Joey is perfect bro material
[0:52:27] <%Shubreaker> Shubreaker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Nominative determinism strikes again. All the time I've spent playing D2 and meeting a lovely girl with an ironic name has lead me to a literal date with Destiny.
[0:52:27] <%peachy996> I liked Frasier. It was not at all directed at me but I liked it
[0:52:28] <%twistedj3ster> that's where your annoying plot guessing comes from!
[0:52:32] <choocheess> that sounds like such a cute sibling relationship
[0:52:34] <dekkitout> Huh, my older sister and I did that with Sanford and Son's

[0:52:53] <%jillyrancher> I hear Fraiser is fantastic
[0:52:54] <%Scevda> Yes

[1:27:05] <sw_paladin> corn is great off the cob
[1:27:06] <WebmanJax> God, you may as well just play GURPS at that point.

[1:27:14] <spongeofmystery> Paige what is it like having this level of self-confidence?
[1:27:14] <Aiutare47> Corn and strawberries if you can get them
[1:27:14] <%walternatorz> can the new mods time out paige?
[1:27:16] <RexTestarossa> im addicted to ff14 and its all your fault so thank you

[1:27:42] <%Sigma_190_Beta> Knife goes in Guts come out @PatStaresAt
[1:27:43] <Mattais88> Knife go in, Guts come out
[1:27:43] <%bevyrage> D&D 5e is streamlined and redundant enough to let a beginner understand how to play the game. You don't even need a seasoned player to tell you how to play so long as you just read how the rules are worded and take 'em literally.
[1:27:43] <%captainpodock> have your guys parents ever met each other?
[1:27:47] <rytisone> knife goes in guts come out
[1:27:47] <%NateyBeak> what if they kithhhed

[1:27:48] <+RowenCleric> knife goes in
[1:27:48] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt deboning is honestly the hard part
[1:27:50] <%demiiluna> demiiluna subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months, currently on a 21 month streak! As much as I hate to restart the Edition wars, if you are interested in D&D, I would honestly suggest 4e. People complained because it felt too much like a video game, but you like video games. It's probably the most natural transition for you.
[1:27:53] <Aiutare47> gutting is easy, its the deboning that's annoying
[1:27:54] <$BlackMage66652> FANTASY RUINED
[1:27:55] <+ThomasOfTroy> I saw my grandma preparing, cooking, and eating catfish heads. It's not a great image

[1:28:56] <MonsterGills> 5E is best
[1:28:56] <@MistyMntns> Play 3.5E or 5e
[1:28:57] <%Piemono> Just do 5e
[1:28:57] <extradopeness> Hey paiges mom! I’m the same way!
[1:28:58] <%InternetShis> Fuck that
[1:29:00] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt PLAY 2E YOU COWARD
[1:29:00] <%aWanderingKaivo> play 4.20e
[1:29:00] <%RealThiele> oh jesus
[1:29:00] <%Ynkubus_> No 4th is the bad one

[1:29:03] <%Puhff> 4th DansGame
[1:29:03] <%SuckerPunchSyd> 4e is confusing
[1:29:04] <Dunmarkh> Just play 5e
[1:29:04] <%Ches_Neckbeard> just play 4th it's a fucking mmo
[1:29:04] <%Agami23> 5E is the new one that everyone plays. goes hard on roleplay
[1:29:05] <%peachy996> Yeah Fuck guys
[1:29:07] <%Scevda> Stole her with dat dick.
[1:29:07] <+JaseAdrift> yeah 5th edition...like a normal person
[1:29:08] <%SovPho> THAT'S MY JOKE
[1:29:08] <%CatRidder> DO NOT PLAY 4TH
[1:29:08] <ChungusQuest> 3,5 is best, but is it best for Pat? Lots of moving parts
[1:29:10] <anAngryHamster> 4th is shit for shit people
[1:29:10] <%bassoontyphoon> 4th is awful though
[1:29:17] <%RealThiele> 2nd edition with non-wep profs.
[1:29:17] <%andrewofbob> IMO 3.5 is bad for the mind goblins
[1:29:22] <SaltyAzteca> TWIRL THE MUSTACHE
[1:29:24] <DatAsuna> 2 kinds of viewer
[1:29:25] <DrkJP520> You should start reading fake donations and whatnot to stall the stream
[1:29:26] <%peachy996> Only if the mods can time pat out in paiges stream for funsies
[1:29:29] <%InternetShis> 3.5 or 5 are good, but actually do not play 4th, that's bait
[1:29:29] <mr_saturday93> that shit eating grin lol

[1:29:38] <%AmericanSkidd> is that a threat?
[1:29:39] <%TheHateFish> 4e is not D&D, it's a mecha game with fantasy dressing. 3.5e is a mess of mechanics, and 5e is an oversimplified, overcommercialised mess. Play PF2e.
[1:29:42] <+JaseAdrift> Ara Ara
[1:29:42] <@SoFarFetched> her mouth is just forever open like geefGasp

[1:31:02] <@BallerSwagBro9k> Catholic DnD sounds ominous
[1:31:03] <%AmericanSkidd> We now return to I Wanna Fuck the Aliens
[1:31:03] <%Bane_Kaikyo> 5e is the way to go tho
[1:31:04] <Dunmarkh> don't you mean protestant?
[1:31:05] <+ThomasOfTroy> I don't need catholic dnd, thank you very much
[1:31:06] <%Kyma1020> Pathfinder's fine if you like number crunching
[1:31:06] <%Sigma_190_Beta> Pathfinder is pretty good.
[1:31:07] <GuyverTypeL> @patstaresat Last time you were to talk to Aria but didn't do all her dialogues, just a reminder, have fun!
[1:31:08] <%SovPho> thuffering thuccotash
[1:31:08] <sw_paladin> pathfinder is fun, I don't know about pathfinder 2.0 tho
[1:31:08] <choocheess> you sound like butthead from beavis and butthead
[1:31:12] <ThatGuyThere03> Are you trying to say catholic?
[1:31:15] <%kingofasgard> thuferrin thuckatath
[1:31:17] <%bassoontyphoon> Pathfinder is good, but I find people min max wayyy too much with it
[1:31:17] <%Scevda> Suckering suckatash
[1:31:17] <%mongorific> 5e is best for beginners
[1:31:19] <%bevyrage> pathfinder is D&D 3.75, and pathfinder 2nd edition is dungeons & dragons skirmish but poorly executed
[1:31:20] <%tank7013> Nice
[1:31:20] <%CatRidder> path is fine but i still recomed for firstimers 5e
[1:31:21] <anAngryHamster> Bathfinder is a Mad magazine level joke and I love it
[1:31:22] <+dd44dostivei> GOATSE
[1:31:23] <@BallerSwagBro9k> @thomasoftroy Right? LUL
[1:31:24] <+TheBigO75> The eternal struggle between good and evil is the main stay of Pathfinder.
[1:31:24] <+tinytinykittycat> BatStaresAt
[1:31:26] <%Kyma1020> 5e is just real streamlined and it's a good way to get your toes wet
[1:31:30] <+Mrbaconator> @sw_paladin lamer less number version of pathfinder
[1:31:32] <+pectusumbra> pathfinder followed the route of DnD 3.5 when DnD itself diverged in 4th edition
[1:31:35] <@BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[1:31:35] <SaltyAzteca> oontz oontz oontz oontz
[1:31:39] <%ahomeschooldropout> IIRC After 3.5 a bunch of nerds were like THIS ISN'T PURE D&D and made Pathfinder
[1:31:40] <%Monkeyweed21> the thells thea thells on the thea thore

[1:32:43] <+tinytinykittycat> I can see my cat get super happy
[1:32:45] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt that doesn't sound right
[1:32:48] <%TheHateFish> I'm still gonna say he should play GURPS, just because the sheer customisation will make the mind goblins happy.
[1:32:50] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Be sure to buy the auto fish tank feeder Pat so your fishies dont die
[1:32:51] <penitentpendant> So, should we lobby for a pasta emote to use when we raid in the future?

[2:00:05] <Zombrocom> Andromeda already left
[2:00:06] <%dawarw0lf> It’s a spoiler
[2:00:07] <%jillyrancher> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[2:00:08] <%peachy996> And that's all that will be said
[2:00:09] <hereiam407> Did they even think of Andromeda at this point?
[2:00:09] <OldManDeckardCain> adromeda WAS a scam tho
[2:00:10] <Latija> this is my favorite part of the citadel
[2:00:13] <KeystoneA2> left
[2:00:14] <%akscully> to your left
[2:00:15] <%aWanderingKaivo> those are not the people talking
[2:00:18] <DatAsuna> Andromeda's arcs have already left before ME2 even happened
[2:00:18] <AxelCezar> making money out of peoples fear???? nooo that is not a thing!
[2:00:18] <+CyanDeadEye> Andromeda is the Initiative.
[2:00:20] <%NitronStreams> Oh geez
[2:00:20] <%jackelzxaa> Sanctuary is SOMETHING
[2:00:20] <%jillyrancher> no

[2:00:41] <hereiam407> @wolverinewaswrong Nice
[2:00:41] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:00:42] <%peachy996> Oh yeah that is Liz Sroka

[2:00:57] <%akscully> down the stairs
[2:00:58] <hereiam407> @wolverinewaswrong played that for the first time a few weeks ago, love that song
[2:00:58] <Sameriarix> Ah yes, two overworked medical workers.  That could only happen in wartime, huh?
[2:01:00] <%peachy996> She has a really unique voice. She voices a Turian in Andromeda too
[2:01:02] <%QueequegTheater> Go down the stairs
[2:01:02] <%RealThiele> reminds me of the stories i heard of nurses intubating a denier right before they go on a vent
[2:01:02] <+ThomasOfTroy> Have we seen literally a single woman wearing pants on the citadel?
[2:01:05] <%DrTomT18> I think Andromeda left before Mass Effect 2 during it
[2:01:07] <%peachy996> And everyone knew it was her
[2:01:08] <DatAsuna> @jackelzxaa nothing bad ever happens at places named sanctuary/haven .etc in video games :P
[2:01:12] <%Shubreaker> you were going the right way
[2:01:20] <GustauveVIII> RELUCTANT CIVVIE
[2:01:23] <%captain_kirkhammer> which complaints, specifically?
[2:01:25] <Ids560> 2 is like spinning its wheels over the course of the entire game
[2:01:25] <%jackelzxaa> Pat creeping on people in public
[2:01:26] <%DrTomT18> RELUCTANT
[2:01:26] <%joodatious> the citadel is so much better in 3 then the others by a huge margin
[2:01:31] <%Scevda> Yep
[2:01:32] <%miguelrod777> reluctant
[2:01:34] <%joodatious> actually feels like people live there
[2:01:35] <yourliteraldog> RELUCTABT

[2:01:54] <%aWanderingKaivo> I love that reaction
[2:01:54] <%jackelzxaa> Go to the open area and downstairs
[2:01:57] <%Ches_Neckbeard> they should volunteer to be canon fodder
[2:02:02] <%jackelzxaa> Theres 4 shops down there
[2:02:04] <HollowMan190> LOL
[2:02:06] <+ThomasOfTroy> There are a LOT of ways to support a war effort without picking up a gun
[2:02:06] <Parapattern> Throw civilians into the thresher
[2:02:07] <arkv01> "who was that?" "your new dad"
[2:02:09] <@BallerSwagBro9k> yep
[2:02:09] <%joodatious> it makes sense and they adress it

[2:02:24] <dekkitout> FAISH
[2:02:26] <whycantipostasguest> are the captions out of sync or is it just me
[2:02:26] <%hax_metatron> The world building in ME3 is phenomenal. Imagine it ended on a happy ending with Citadel DLC, and left it up to you what happened during the war. Imagine they had the balls.
[2:02:26] <%Birdigalore> I'm Commander Shepard, and tyhis is my favorite opinion on the Citadel
[2:02:26] <yourliteraldog> BLOOD DRAGON
[2:02:26] <+CookieCutter007> Arbiter Grindset

[2:02:51] <%peachy996> Which store is the chunky Gamestop armor in?

[2:04:35] <Mattais88> It's a shotgun i think
[2:04:35] <mikeriffic> its the best shotgun in the game
[2:04:37] <%peachy996> Not now
[2:04:38] <%rkbinder> Best Gun
[2:04:39] <Laecerelius> Yeah, Reegar gun is strong but you might need some ultralight materials to make it lighter
[2:04:40] <%peachy996> Later tho
[2:04:41] <DatAsuna> Reegar is one of the best shotguns in MP
[2:04:42] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Pick one gun you really like and spend money upgrading it
[2:04:44] <%jackelzxaa> Reeger and adas are amazing guns
[2:04:45] <cooldude69xx> Reegar is a lightning shotgun
[2:04:46] <%dawarw0lf> He needs something longer range
[2:04:47] <%kyh9> It's basically a flamethrower
[2:04:47] <yourliteraldog> geth shot gun is
[2:04:47] <Profmcstevie> We can undo heavy with time
[2:04:48] <%aWanderingKaivo> Don't worry so much about weight anything around 150% is fine

[2:05:05] <%jillyrancher> it's worth trying
[2:05:07] <+OneGorillionDollars> its not exactly a shotgun @PatStaresAt
[2:05:09] <Aiutare47> its a strange one, its like a flamethrower that does extra damage against shields and synthetics
[2:05:10] <%jackelzxaa> Get reeger and adas

[2:06:34] <28moogles> sets keep their helmets, there's also individual pieces you can mix and match elsewhere
[2:06:35] <KeystoneA2> The helmets on armor sets don't come off without mods.

[2:06:58] <tanarath> @patstaresat it might come off during cutscenes with the option?
[2:06:59] <+fetrigon> *intentionally gives you the wrong answer to your question*
[2:07:00] <%jackelzxaa> Yes
[2:07:03] <%Axellogic> DLC price is it looks opulent and a bit off but also fuck you you cant customize it

[2:08:02] <+ThomasOfTroy> DS9 Worf logic requires Shepard and Liara to commit some light terrorism
[2:08:06] <%jillyrancher> freckles
[2:08:10] <%DrTomT18> you'd think that the threat of extinction would push people into action
[2:08:12] <+dd44dostivei> cuz barla von works for the shadow broker

[2:08:20] <%Axellogic> FF15 avatara really spoiled me on how good the character creator fit Noctis's lip sync while the faces looked dramatically different. Shepard always looks so .... shepardy

[2:08:46] <%jillyrancher> @drtomt18 People on Citadel feel they are safe and the war is far away
[2:08:48] <Laecerelius> Commander Shephard will let his crew do a bit of terrorism.  As a treat.
[2:08:50] <BinaryBetrayer> @BinaryBetrayer Does it at least look decent this time around?

[2:18:45] <@BallerSwagBro9k> Venom shotgun is a charging Shotgun that can one shot Ravagers
[2:18:45] <+OneGorillionDollars> Trust me a lot of the weapons are pretty cool so cheating for the credits is worth it imo
[2:18:47] <%CatastropheCorvid> STIE LEET AND CHEAL.
[2:18:48] <dekkitout> "Hey look, Shep won the lottery"

[2:18:52] <niffinbox> ''heres some money i prepared earlier''
[2:18:53] <%dawarw0lf> I’m ok with cheats since the arena should be something you can start early. I hate it being locked behind something so far in
[2:18:54] <blackjack8182> Embrace your inner Billy Mitchell
[2:18:56] <%peachy996> I think the Venom synergizes great with Vanguards
[2:18:57] <%jillyrancher> yeah its fine
[2:18:57] <%ComfortableStranger> watch him come back with 1 billion credits
[2:19:03] <%DrTomT18> how do you cheat for credits in this game?
[2:19:05] <PaperyHornet1013> Inheritance
[2:19:12] <+CyanDeadEye> Never used the Venom, what's its main pros?
[2:19:12] <%jillyrancher> try all the weapons they're all really neato
[2:19:14] <choocheess> @OneGorillionDollars the guns definitely seem more unique this time
[2:19:15] <$realm_forge> And so Shepard saved the galaxy with infinite money…..the end
[2:19:19] <%Order_of_Mystery> pat stares at cheat engine psaJpeg
[2:19:22] <%AmericanSkidd> he is getting money from his galactic swiss bank account
[2:19:24] <%dawarw0lf> Venom kills EVEYTHING in one charge even on insanity
[2:19:35] <Vantesla> time to become omega rich out of thin air LUL
[2:19:35] <%jillyrancher> venom only issue is it's super heavy
[2:19:36] <@BallerSwagBro9k> @peachy996 I ran Venom Shotgun and Krysae Sniper Rifle and basically one shot everything
[2:19:36] <yourliteraldog> So is the edi bot fuckable or is she gonna have to crave room for a flesh light
[2:19:45] <dekkitout> That's right kids, in times of war, printing more money is a definite solution
[2:19:52] <%peachy996> Where is the N7 Defender Armor in this game?
[2:19:53] <%tank7013> Pat Shepard is gonna pay the Reapers 200 credits to fuck off
[2:19:59] <%dawarw0lf> @cyandeadeye It’s 5 explosive gernades at once and makes the big boom
[2:19:59] <@BallerSwagBro9k> @dawarw0lf yup
[2:20:01] <%peachy996> Pat needs to see that one
[2:20:05] <%jillyrancher> @yourliteraldog She probably has a vag.
[2:20:05] <%Alig200> @yourliteraldog well, it is an infiltration unit, I can see cerberus making sure its capable of that kind of infilitration.
[2:20:05] <choocheess> @yourliteraldog probably needs a coochie mod
[2:20:05] <+DACH33ZMAN> are credits like bitcoin in the ME universe
[2:20:07] <+vaderxyz1970> @dekkitout What Inflation
[2:20:13] <+OneGorillionDollars> @choocheess they are, and a few of them dont even behave like others in their class so they are extra unique
[2:20:17] <drawie_holly> illusive man would never make a robot he couldn't fuck
[2:20:20] <%peachy996> @BallerSwagBro9k Pretty much

[2:45:10] <DatAsuna> I hate the grenade launcher, they're only good for the rocket exploit
[2:45:11] <+DACH33ZMAN> i hate the scopes in this game
[2:45:12] <Aiutare47> it shoots faster the longer you hold down the trigger, and when mixed with AP Ammo, like the kind garrus has, it goes through cover.
[2:45:16] <%jackelzxaa> Venom shotgun is mvp
[2:45:17] <%LumberjackJack> It's amazing, and arguably the best gun to give to your soldier companions (extra rounds + extended barrell)
[2:45:19] <%jillyrancher> I love how you can hear the thermal clip hitting the ground when you eject
[2:45:21] <blackjack8182> Harrier is GOAT
[2:45:21] <%Birdigalore> Indeed
[2:45:21] <Sameriarix> Weight doesn't matter for squaddies, so they can go nuts
[2:45:21] <wasdsf> it sucks
[2:45:22] <choocheess> I know you feel this, Shepherd
[2:45:22] <williamrooster> now garrus can be the main character

[2:45:29] <%InternetShis> Garrus takes every drug at once
[2:45:31] <%jackelzxaa> It is like having cluster bombs of high calibur rounds x
[2:45:32] <+unhuggable1> harrier so good
[2:45:33] <@goose_attack_almanac> Garrus WILL fuck the world with that
[2:45:34] <AngryAsian5> Actually, give it to all of your squadmates LUL

[2:45:43] <%jillyrancher> Typhon heavy motherfucker
[2:45:44] <%jackelzxaa> All of these guns are amazing
[2:45:46] <Vantesla> Sadly for power builds Typhoon weight is a bit to hefty. Though given PC if really want you can just axe weight LUL

[2:50:46] <%InternetShis> Got some wack spread but you only need the first 5 shots
[2:50:49] <+ThomasOfTroy> Try at a longer range
[2:50:49] <%aWanderingKaivo> harrier is OP tbh
[2:50:52] <mikeriffic> Its great
[2:50:52] <%ComfortableStranger> u wil CHEW threw ammo FAST
[2:50:55] <%shadowsofpain> Try the Executioner pistol @patstaresat
[2:50:55] <%peachy996> All of these Guns can be upgraded by the way. These are all at I
[2:50:55] <@BallerSwagBro9k> yeyeye
[2:50:55] <%NateyBeak> thats a great sound too
[2:50:57] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> Great especially seeing as how you're focusing on powers and melee
[2:50:58] <+CyanDeadEye> Harrier makes insanity pretty easy by itself, especially with Incinerator ammo
[2:50:58] <@goose_attack_almanac> Cerberus Harrier was a favourite for the online play
[2:50:59] <%Ranryu692> hell yeah it does
[2:50:59] <%Alig200> @PatStaresAt weapon upgrades via the normandy shuttle bay will reduce weight too if you dont want to use the weapon mod for that.
[2:51:00] <mikeriffic> Its just an automatic Mattock
[2:51:00] <28moogles> and that's not even all the weapons
[2:51:02] <%QueequegTheater> Do it
[2:51:02] <+beansoup> upgrade and it'll be 200
[2:51:02] <choocheess> aren't you glad you did the reasonable pragmatic thing and got all these?
[2:51:04] <tanarath> long range!
[2:51:04] <%homelesstwinky> running just an AR is a valid strat
[2:51:05] <%dawarw0lf> It’s so good but balanced by having no ammo
[2:51:05] <%aWanderingKaivo> try the hurricane though, its the mega BRT smg
[2:51:06] <%peachy996> Guns can go to X
[2:51:06] <%joodatious> BIG pistol
[2:51:06] <%jackelzxaa> Adas is a wacky gun
[2:51:06] <DatAsuna> ammo and AP harrier destroys bosses
[2:51:07] <%afronooch> upgrading makes them lighter
[2:51:07] <$realm_forge> Big damage but low reserves
[2:51:08] <Mcjiggyjay> best damn gun in multiplayer
[2:51:10] <%jackelzxaa> Its incredible
[2:51:13] <penitentpendant> Looks like an Ork pistol
[2:51:14] <Gelphaze> Sold Harrair.
[2:51:14] <KeystoneA2> This and the gun you get in Citadel are so OP and make Insanity a cakewalk.
[2:51:16] <@BallerSwagBro9k> It's one shot lol
[2:51:18] <%Monkeyweed21> you can upgrade it to be lighter
[2:51:18] <rytisone> now if you die with all this equipment...
[2:51:20] <%jillyrancher> if you use Melee a lot equip the bayonet @patstaresat
[2:51:20] <+DACH33ZMAN> TRUE Upgrade that bitch to level V
[2:51:21] <%Ches_Neckbeard> really just read the description on the Executioner
[2:51:21] <%James_Quivers> MAGNUM
[2:51:22] <SaltyAzteca> SHOTGUN PISTOL
[2:51:22] <%CaptainPileDriver> CaptainPileDriver subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 54 months, currently on a 8 month streak! 4 and 1/2 years, damn time fliesbecause of you i'm now playing two tcg's, runterra and digimon tcg and i couldn't be happier.
[2:51:23] <%jackelzxaa> Try adas too
[2:51:25] <+FelIian> Executioners Pistol with a scope and lightweight is AMAZING
[2:51:25] <%ComfortableStranger> harrier never got nerfed in MP which blows my mind
[2:51:26] <%joodatious> hand canon
[2:51:26] <%Hitman0257> acolyte pistol is also good
[2:51:27] <Laecerelius> Big murder pistol
[2:51:29] <%peachy996> This is the gun that breaks the Edi encounter
[2:51:30] <%InternetShis> POCKET SHOTTY
[2:51:30] <%shadowsofpain> It deletes
[2:51:31] <GustauveVIII> give it a scope
[2:51:31] <%Ranryu692> YUP
[2:51:31] <Dunmarkh> Name makes sense now
[2:51:32] <%NopeBadguy> THERE IS NO POWER
[2:51:33] <%NopeBadguy> DIE
[2:51:34] <%dawarw0lf> Adas too
[2:51:34] <%DrTomT18> just a big fuck off gun
[2:51:34] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt The N7 Hurricane SMG is the best smg in the game
[2:51:35] <%Birdigalore> Big Mugnum
[2:51:36] <+FelIian> SNIPER PISTOL
[2:51:37] <Profmcstevie> CEASE EXISTENCE
[2:51:37] <tanarath> SNIPER PISTOL
[2:51:38] <%bread_assassin> @PatStaresAt If you put on the Blood Dragon Armor, that extra weight is pretty much negligible.
[2:51:38] <Vantesla> if increase to rank 5 as others stated it will reduce weight and better general stats.
[2:51:40] <%HotSauceFiend> how much did i miss
[2:51:40] <%SovPho> Late game vanguards basically just want a pistol lol
[2:51:42] <%Monkeyweed21> its the krogan shotgun from 2
[2:51:42] <%peachy996> If you use that on Mars, it's a game breaker
[2:51:43] <Sameriarix> It hits like a Widow sniper rifle
[2:51:43] <%DrTomT18> upgrades also make it reload faster
[2:51:44] <Lancaster_H> ONE IN THE CHAMBER
[2:51:45] <+DACH33ZMAN> upgrade terminal is on normandy @PatStaresAt
[2:51:46] <%Ranryu692> it's not for every build, but it was worth seeing
[2:51:46] <%ComfortableStranger> its a hand held widow
[2:51:47] <niffinbox> space flintlock
[2:51:49] <%aWanderingKaivo> I love how everyone has so many different guns they love, proof of ME3's great weapon design
[2:51:50] <Sameriarix> IT's stupid strong
[2:51:50] <%jackelzxaa> The biggest pistol

[2:52:35] <$StrawberryPantsu> They said they might add it @PatStaresAt
[2:52:35] <%ComfortableStranger> buy every gun on the normandy in the cargo bay
[2:52:35] <%SovPho> @PatStaresAt the multiplayer was loot-box based and was fun to PLAY but awful to grind
[2:52:38] <%Alig200> MP never stopped working, you just need to use the original for it.
[2:52:38] <Botman_R> It's still active on the original game.
[2:52:38] <%count_bob> please
[2:52:39] <Darkred28> FeelsBadMan Never ever
[2:52:39] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> please add it back

[2:52:44] <FassieFons> punch him NOW
[2:52:44] <sw_paladin> the multiplayer was legit fun
[2:52:46] <SaltyAzteca> Fart on his face!
[2:52:47] <%Axellogic> Being a Melee Krogan Vangaurd was the hottest shit in the multiplayer.
[2:52:47] <akitanito> shepard? bye.
[2:52:47] <%AmericanSkidd> I should go
[2:52:49] <@goose_attack_almanac> Multiplayer is still up on the original version. You can also console command everything in with no consequence
[2:52:49] <rytisone> Andromeda has multiplayer Kappa
[2:52:50] <%DrTomT18> but like... with like titanfall progression
[2:52:50] <%joodatious> it got leaked that the MP is coming at some point
[2:52:50] <GustauveVIII> would pat self-insert into the game and play a volus in the MP?
[2:52:52] <Aiutare47> People have theorized that dropping Dennuvo means MP is coming back
[2:52:54] <Dunmarkh> "Bavarian" LUL
[2:53:00] <$realm_forge> For real
[2:53:00] <%jillyrancher> so many great cool guns
[2:53:01] <%shadowsofpain> Sorry mobile
[2:53:05] <%Ranryu692> did Pat go to the Presidium Commons yet?
[2:53:06] <+dukeofhammer> The multiplayer was fun :)
[2:53:12] <GameOver_Here> You can still play MP if you play the 360 version on backwards compatibility. There servers are still up.
[2:53:15] <RoldanDgr8> you're supposed to be corrupted, Bailey
[2:53:15] <%shadowsofpain> auto correct sucks
[2:53:15] <Vantesla> EA should fund it due to the success in sales. But they half ass as is so I'm not expecting much...
[2:53:21] <kikoeru_san> that's the Doc from New Vegas
[2:53:22] <retrosadness> his CHIN
[2:53:25] <kikoeru_san> holy shit
[2:53:27] <+DACH33ZMAN> @GameOver_Here I played last week had a blast
[2:53:30] <DatAsuna> @rytisone andromeda MP was also pretty good, better than vanilla me3 mp, but it just doesn't have the benefit of 4 expansions like Me3 MP sadly.
[2:53:30] <%joodatious> @GameOver_Here ew xbonx
[2:53:32] <%peachy996> The MP can be grindy but something about it is better than Andromeda's nightmare of a gun grind
[2:53:32] <%jillyrancher> Can't wait for Pat to the Citadel AR rifle he will Cream himself
[2:53:36] <%ComfortableStranger> @Alig200 it doesn't work in that if you run it at 60fps or higher the enemies are ridiculously fast and deadly
[2:53:36] <yourliteraldog> Volus Biotic was a fun gimmick
[2:53:36] <%The_Death_Owl> Andromeda mp is ok I guess but the progression isn't good
[2:53:46] <%Keaton_x> Is that General Tullius?
[2:53:54] <TourettesPlays> [Speech 30] Theres a turian thats been poisoned and jona sedaris has the antidote
[2:53:54] <%DrTomT18> awakened collectors are cool
[2:53:57] <+vaderxyz1970> I'll Fcking do it again
[2:53:57] <DatAsuna> it is tullius yes
[2:54:01] <%QueequegTheater> @ComfortableStranger You call it a bug I call it a difficulty tweak
[2:54:02] <%dawarw0lf> Fuck that last update to Andromeda. It bloated the game
[2:54:06] <%joodatious> also there isn't anywere as much stuff in andromadas and the enemies SUCK
[2:54:10] <%peachy996> Took 2 years to get the Piranha in Andromeda's MP, Took me a couple months to get it in ME3
[2:54:10] <%shadowsofpain> I'd rather just play the MP in 60fps on my playstation without having to drag my ps3 from the closet
[2:54:13] <%jillyrancher> Michael Hogan iirc
[2:54:15] <Mcjiggyjay> same
[2:54:15] <yourliteraldog> Pats in HEAT

[2:54:26] <choocheess> Its also Doc Mitchell
[2:54:27] <%ComfortableStranger> @peachy996 andromeda MP can run at 60fps plus without making the enemies stronger
[2:54:29] <%CaptainPileDriver> the sweatiest balls confirmed
[2:54:30] <28moogles> More importantly it's a main character from the 2000s run of Battlestar Galactica. Same with EDI's actress. And the Geth plotline. lol
[2:54:30] <+fetrigon> how are you sweating in space?
[2:54:30] <Daxalog> Its 28 C
[2:54:30] <%Alig200> @Alig200 ah, I never even knew that was an issue, but then again I never turn off v-sync so I never go above 60 myself lol.

[3:10:59] <%shadowsofpain> I think I agree ME2 may actually be the worst game of the trilogy, it doesn't play as good as 3 it's not as good storywise as 1 and it's the most filler story of the bunch
[3:11:03] <+tinytinykittycat> Saren can joinyour squad later

[3:16:27] <%peachy996> Big Chungus Shep
[3:16:33] <%ohno778> HOLY FUCKING SHIT FISH
[3:16:37] <%dawarw0lf> Best armor is Ajax
[3:16:45] <%shadowsofpain> BTW @patstaresat that reckoner armor was a Kingdomcome: reckoning thing
[3:16:46] <%Deft_Thought> Ajax looks cool
[3:16:49] <%jillyrancher> Turn on the Radio Pat
[3:16:56] <KeystoneA2> Ajax is rad
[3:16:56] <%DrTomT18> Pat no, you can't wear terrorist armor!
[3:16:58] <%Alig200> @PatStaresAt pressing x to toggle info will show armor stats in numbers
[3:17:00] <yourliteraldog> but it's cerberus
[3:17:02] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt The best armor in the game is acquired in The Citadel DLC.
[3:17:03] <+DACH33ZMAN> I hate how it has cerberus logos on it tho
[3:17:04] <@commanderclaw> Ajax was a Greek hero IIRC
[3:17:06] <%peachy996> I just want you to look at the absurd N7 Defender, you don't have to use it
[3:17:07] <KeystoneA2> There are some nice retextures for the Ajax on the Nexus
[3:17:08] <sw_paladin> Boo!!!!
[3:17:11] <%walternatorz> meep
[3:17:12] <%DrTomT18> Defender armor!
[3:17:12] <yourliteraldog> HAMSTER
[3:17:14] <%ohno778> But it's cerberus....
[3:17:14] <niffinbox> we need to see that shiny dome though
[3:17:18] <SaltyAzteca> it squeaks!
[3:17:18] <%sunsetdisc0> love that ham
[3:17:18] <stantheman_97> squeak
[3:17:21] <Aiutare47> I ran the ajax for 3 whole playthroughs, just got a mod that recolored it to alliance colors
[3:17:21] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Oh Kaiden’s gonna hate that
[3:17:22] <%jillyrancher> @drtomt18 Haha Cerberus armor look cool
[3:17:26] <sw_paladin> I don't care for the Ajax
[3:17:37] <28moogles> You mostly use your power though, so bigger power number, right?
[3:17:39] <%dawarw0lf> Blood pack and inferno is also good
[3:17:43] <%DashXero> Pulsar Cannon
[3:17:43] <%DrTomT18> you like power, Pat
[3:17:49] <%AmericanSkidd> all you have to do is dress like a terrorist
[3:17:49] <akitanito> why are all cerberus armor better
[3:17:50] <%captain_kirkhammer> As a VCanguard wouldn't you want power damage and power recharge more than anything else
[3:17:52] <%dawarw0lf> Not blood pack I meant blood dragon
[3:17:53] <Goatllama> which one has the best codpiece
[3:17:53] <%DrTomT18> Blood Armor is cool
[3:17:55] <+DACH33ZMAN> blooddragon armor is bitchin
[3:17:55] <$Teh_Un> Blood Dragon is my personal fav
[3:18:03] <%jillyrancher> Reckoner is good for Vanguard
[3:18:03] <mikeriffic> Yeyeye
[3:18:04] <%James_Quivers> Kingdom Hearts armor
[3:18:04] <SaltyAzteca> its a suit of armor
[3:18:05] <@Ranryu692> Ajax was a hero who defeated the Greeks. Ajax is also a dish soap that defeats Grease
[3:18:06] <mikeriffic> Read the canon
[3:18:08] <mikeriffic> The lore
[3:18:11] <%Monkeyweed21> WHY IS THERE A BELT
[3:18:11] <%ShawnTK_> @akitanito Because DLC
[3:18:11] <%peachy996> This was from the Amalur cross promotion thing
[3:18:12] <mikeriffic> its just football armor
[3:18:12] <%Ravioli_Ronin> But can you stack a custom set to be just as good?
[3:18:16] <RoldanDgr8> you get the shepard armor in kingdoms of amalur
[3:18:17] <%DrTomT18> the Blood Dragon and Alamar armor are meant to be worn by sports teams
[3:18:19] <Laecerelius> Blood dragon seems pretty good for charging and novaing
[3:18:22] <yourliteraldog> URBAN COMBAT CHAMPIONSHIP fuck yeah blood sports
[3:18:23] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Dragons are cool, but dragons made of blood? Cooler.

[3:18:30] <%DrTomT18> time to max out every gun
[3:18:32] <%HaroldDonchee> the reckoner is coolest to me because it's so chunky
[3:18:33] <$Faustgesicht> Ajax also was an asshole in Deadpool
[3:18:34] <yourliteraldog> robo dog
[3:18:40] <%Alig200> the individual armor pieces can stack up to be pretty good, but it can be awhile till you get a full set.
[3:18:41] <%jillyrancher> ITS TODD MCFARLANE PAT

[3:20:48] <%LeiaSkynoober> I don't know why I asked lol
[3:20:51] <%MelBrooksKA> Bitch I'll suck the right

[3:20:55] <%Scevda> Congrats you cheated
[3:20:55] <Heartrigger_> I can't believe Pat cheated in the video game NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:20:55] <AngryAsian5> Garrus will now ascend to his rightful place in Godhood.
[3:20:56] <%SirGO0SE> pat please
[3:20:56] <FassieFons> do you even have nuts after this cowardice
[3:20:56] <%peachy996> Oh pffft narrative
[3:20:57] <DomunDomunDomun> The right nut is the marriage nut.
[3:20:58] <dekkitout> Right human nuts tend to be venomous, rather than the benign left nuts
[3:20:59] <stantheman_97> no one ever gives attention to the right nut
[3:21:00] <rytisone> he's still gonna die
[3:21:00] <rekinom> Nut up Pat
[3:21:01] <%HotSauceFiend> so the right one doesnt dip? it what, shrinks in?
[3:21:01] <%Solid_Stro> Your right, Narrative is more your style
[3:21:01] <PaperyHornet1013> The turrets will still get you
[3:21:03] <LLCoolZJ> when i dip you dip we dip
[3:21:03] <yourliteraldog> NARRATIVE MOOD
[3:21:04] <anAngryHamster> I had to check my own, it holds up
[3:21:07] <Goatllama> should do a poll for ball alignment
[3:21:08] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt So you're saying that Hardcore is the new Normal, huh Kappa
[3:21:08] <Mattais88> When in doubt, damage
[3:21:11] <blackjack8182> Harrier and Pistol
[3:21:13] <Laecerelius> omni blade for more melee?
[3:21:14] <@MistyMntns> @SoFarFetched Not me. I'm a good angle VirtualHug
[3:21:15] <perfectharbinger> Harrier is probably the best AR in the game for Shepard.
[3:21:17] <%DrTomT18> check out uuuhhh
[3:21:25] <@SoFarFetched> @MistyMntns or are you debil? geefPoint
[3:21:28] <%DrTomT18> check out the N7 guns
[3:21:30] <williamrooster> I dont remember the omni bayonet
[3:21:37] <ingman112> Might as well get another gun
[3:21:38] <@MistyMntns> @SoFarFetched I'm not a western spy that is for sure.
[3:21:39] <@SoFarFetched> also Ive seen you as paiges mod so you're fine geefLul
[3:21:42] <%Scevda> @williamrooster dlc
[3:21:42] <blackjack8182> Grab a pistol
[3:21:43] <+DACH33ZMAN> @williamrooster its a dlc mod
[3:21:44] <%count_bob> shotgun
[3:21:45] <@commanderclaw> I like a pistol as a sidearm personally
[3:21:46] <Xiangchang> The Black Widow is an amazing Sniper Rifle.
[3:21:48] <Botman_R> Sniper Rifles are HEAVY
[3:21:56] <+DACH33ZMAN> reegar + inferno ammo.............
[3:22:02] <SaltyAzteca> whatever happened to the nuke?
[3:22:05] <%DrTomT18> Shotgun and pistol really are the best guns for Vanguard
[3:22:09] <%jillyrancher> Tiny native gamer gets dominated by big, heavy, giant turret
[3:22:10] <+DACH33ZMAN> YESSSSSSSSSS
[3:22:21] <%dawarw0lf> Smg maybe
[3:22:24] <%Scevda> @saltyazteca heavy weapons are mission pickups now
[3:22:26] <%Monkeyweed21> GUN GO BRR
[3:22:28] <%Solid_Stro> sabert14Gun lytUSEGUN shotoPew
[3:22:29] <@QueequegTheater> @SaltyAzteca I think it got turned into a pickup
[3:22:30] <$Faustgesicht> Reegar pierces already soo
[3:22:32] <%DrTomT18> sure why not
[3:22:33] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Yea
[3:22:33] <%shadowsofpain> Give yourself a pocket sniper with the executioner
[3:22:34] <%peachy996> Capacity, Weight, Damage tend to be what you want. Sometimes a good scope
[3:22:34] <%James_Quivers> sure
[3:22:41] <+DACH33ZMAN> if you put on the anti armor mod it SHREDS literally everything in the game
[3:22:43] <SaltyAzteca> ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh thats cool
[3:22:44] <%shurtal> give it a shot.....GUN
[3:23:02] <perfectharbinger> That bottom-right pop-up is gonna be here for a while lol.
[3:23:07] <+GrizzleBearMAK> get all the mod upgrades too if you can
[3:23:08] <$lotharrio> Power
[3:23:13] <%joodatious> Reeger has no range so be careful since you said you wanted a range option
[3:23:16] <%AJ_Cherenkov> Note, any penetration like that means you can shoot through cerberus shields
[3:23:17] <PaperyHornet1013> Experiment
[3:23:20] <%SABiscotti> Now comes the pop-up spam lol
[3:23:33] <%dawarw0lf> This pop up spam
[3:23:35] <%shadowsofpain> See is you can squeeze in a pistol?
[3:23:35] <%AmericanSkidd> which makes zero sense for a lightning gun
[3:23:35] <+DACH33ZMAN> id recommend a pistol too for maybe a little range but other than that youre gunna destroy everything
[3:23:40] <%dawarw0lf> Will be here forever
[3:23:40] <HyperionXV> Looks like you have enough extra weight to have 2 guns
[3:23:40] <%James_Quivers> INFINITE POP UPS
[3:23:40] <dekkitout> Big Jim!
[3:23:40] <Laecerelius> Yeah if you want a gun for ranged the reegar isn't very good for that
[3:23:41] <%SirGO0SE> I like when the gun become the better gun
[3:23:41] <%afronooch> uncle shep needs a pop up blocker
[3:23:44] <+cermo55> they don't explain the damage piercing and "armor" well

[3:24:51] <%shadowsofpain> Come back every now and them
[3:24:55] <%James_Quivers> ALL ENGINEERS ALL THE TIME
[3:25:02] <%SABiscotti> These two are probably the best crew mates?
[3:25:04] <%peachy996> While I want to keep the bit going doing Grissom Academy now is a good idea. It's mostly a simple shooty mission
[3:25:09] <perfectharbinger> Yeah, Kenneth gets completely changed if Gabby dies.
[3:25:09] <DatAsuna> Oh yeah, if you only saved ken in ME2, he'll be PTSD'd for all of ME3 lol

[3:25:50] <+DACH33ZMAN> @DrTomT18 i always wondered that too that guy was hilarious
[3:25:51] <perfectharbinger> They get less dialogue in this game but I think their dialogue is overall better.
[3:25:52] <%DrTomT18> which one, there are several of those
[3:25:56] <%joodatious> psaBlep
[3:25:58] <GustauveVIII> the chef from ME2 is entirely absent and not mentioned ever again

[3:32:02] <+london_flexing> FROM CROSSING FATE
[3:32:04] <%AJ_Cherenkov> @RetroCop87 correct
[3:32:04] <+DACH33ZMAN> Cortez is definitely there
[3:32:11] <yourliteraldog> EDI has a  bone-itus fetish
[3:32:11] <@QueequegTheater> But what if he was tho O_o
[3:32:11] <ingman112> And they don’t stop coming
[3:32:12] <Javier9563> BORK
[3:32:12] <mikeriffic> We are being grissom blue balled guys
[3:32:13] <DatAsuna> cortez's story will be completed, don't worry about it
[3:32:17] <%dawarw0lf> Poor guy
[3:32:19] <DatAsuna> It's not something you have to rush
[3:32:20] <%RetroCop87> no notification sound in space
[3:32:20] <Aiutare47> he moves around the armory between missions
[3:32:22] <%AmericanSkidd> there will be time for cortez
[3:32:23] <%Monkeyweed21> 1 more mission until Grissom expires right
[3:32:24] <stantheman_97> holy shit we left the citadel
[3:32:25] <%Agami23> @TourettesPlays marvel sucks just as bad.
[3:32:26] <+condemned_15> he was doing his own calibrations
[3:32:28] <%saiko2208> I want the popup to be there for the rest of the game
[3:32:28] <%jillyrancher> Cortez it's cool
[3:32:28] <DatAsuna> there's more than enough chances to get his dialogue
[3:32:29] <EasternEagle21> So did Pat do a cheat to unlock near infinite ammo or something?
[3:32:30] <%Lizard0TM> one thing I don't like about vanilla ME3 is the weapon upgrade stuff only goes up to V in the first play through which is really lame
[3:32:31] <ingman112> HEY PAT CORTEZ CORTEZ RABBLE RABBLE
[3:32:32] <$ainzhelm> He was hiding
[3:32:33] <%dawarw0lf> Pat has tons of times to do it
[3:32:33] <Vantesla> Garrus and Vega with Typhoon just obliterate everything. Makes the game on insanity trivial LUL
[3:32:36] <%bread_assassin> @peachy996 With Miranda, it's part intentional since she was in-universe designed to have a perfectly symmetrical face. Chobot is just a fuck up.

[3:34:05] <%Lizard0TM> not every galaxy has things to find
[3:34:09] <perfectharbinger> Especially because, in the Codex, they establish that the Reapers use that horn to indoctrinate people.

[3:36:17] <%ComfortableStranger> hey drinking Garrus juice was your dream, not mine
[3:36:19] <+GuilKato> and need to take her off the ship?
[3:36:19] <%YakumoYomi> Javik has no honor. I do not like him.

[3:36:43] <%LumberjackJack> Typhoon on everyone who can carry it
[3:36:44] <%shadowsofpain> That's Javik
[3:36:44] <blue8moon> that is not garrus
[3:36:46] <DatAsuna> Typhoon is good when he's specifically built for it
[3:36:47] <Laecerelius> That's javik but i'm sure it's still good on him
[3:36:47] <%AmericanSkidd> Can chat spell Discretion?
[3:36:48] <TourettesPlays> Jarek????
[3:36:48] <Dunmarkh> yes
[3:36:49] <$Faustgesicht> Yes
[3:36:50] <%shadowsofpain> yes
[3:36:51] <%captain_kirkhammer> yes
[3:36:53] <%dawarw0lf> I mean no
[3:36:54] <akitanito> "jerik"
[3:36:56] <%toolofparanoia> WEAPON DAMAGE BARREL
[3:36:58] <28moogles> I want to see your playthrough, not the chats.
[3:36:58] <tanarath> yes
[3:36:58] <$Faustgesicht> Kinda
[3:36:58] <%peachy996> That's Jarek from MK4?
[3:36:59] <%Ynkubus_> psaBlind
[3:36:59] <GustauveVIII> AMMO CAPACITY + DAMAGE
[3:37:01] <Dunmarkh> kinda
[3:37:02] <%peachy996> Not really
[3:37:02] <@commanderclaw> Yes, Garrus' AP ammo makes the typhoon busted
[3:37:03] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Whose Jerak?
[3:37:03] <williamrooster> give javik his gun
[3:37:04] <+OneGorillionDollars> i mean its still a good gun
[3:37:04] <%AJ_Cherenkov> THE BLACK DRAGON IS GONE JAREK
[3:37:06] <%joodatious> give javik beam weapon
[3:37:09] <ingman112> Thank god woolz is shuttering chat
[3:37:09] <@QueequegTheater> THE BLACK DRAGON
[3:37:12] <perfectharbinger> Just give them both Typhoon's, fuck it.
[3:37:13] <+TheBitingIrish> Typhoon goes BRRRRT
[3:37:13] <DatAsuna> no, it's jerec from dark force 2
[3:37:17] <%joodatious> his special weapon
[3:37:20] <%shadowsofpain> No as in your equipping Javik atm
[3:37:24] <Aiutare47> its the AP ammo on garrus that fucks hard. his AP ammo lets it go through cover, meaning he can do insane damage even to enemies you cant kill
[3:37:25] <%jillyrancher> WASOKAAAAAAAAY
[3:37:25] <+cermo55> weight is meaningless for partners
[3:37:27] <%joodatious> the protheon beam
[3:37:28] <DatAsuna> his brand
[3:37:28] <digaogrunge> Javik needs his pew pew laser
[3:37:28] <%peachy996> If you give the Typhoon to Garrus and Javik they can melt Insanity's last map
[3:37:29] <+GrizzleBearMAK> Give Garrus the Typhoon with barrel and Armor piercing and spec his talents for weapon damage
[3:37:32] <%aWanderingKaivo> the particle beam AR was what he used in the past remember
[3:37:33] <%joodatious> yeee
[3:37:40] <%jillyrancher> This is not a brutality this is a fatality
[3:37:42] <TourettesPlays> Does Pat know the armors for squadmates give different bonuses?
[3:37:43] <blue8moon> it is a laser gun
[3:37:44] <%joodatious> constant damage is big number
[3:37:52] <stormhawk9891> It's more for flavor
[3:37:52] <%jillyrancher> bean weapon
[3:37:52] <Dunmarkh> piercing good
[3:37:52] <%joodatious> anything works
[3:37:53] <%captain_kirkhammer> @ingman112 what? is woolie just not having a chat anymore?
[3:37:55] <%dawarw0lf> Damage
[3:37:56] <%toolofparanoia> beam go Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzt
[3:37:57] <@QueequegTheater> Does the penetration mod even work with the laser weapon?
[3:37:57] <Laecerelius> yes, pat knows about the armors
[3:37:58] <%AJ_Cherenkov> dAMAG
[3:37:59] <KeystoneA2> One that makes damage number go up
[3:38:00] <GustauveVIII> Ammo Capacity = more sustained damage for Typhoon
[3:38:04] <Aiutare47> also if I recall correctly the beam cannot pierce cover
[3:38:05] <DatAsuna> You already have piercing so
[3:38:06] <tanarath> damage & ap is Goff
[3:38:09] <tanarath> good
[3:38:10] <@QueequegTheater> @captain_kirkhammer He's going to ignore them during videos from now on
[3:38:11] <digaogrunge> damag
[3:38:13] <%joodatious> he just points and hurts things
[3:38:20] <%shadowsofpain> give him the big boy pistol
[3:38:21] <%dawarw0lf> @captain_kirkhammer Sub only for a bit
[3:38:25] <GustauveVIII> pistol doesnt matter
[3:38:26] <DatAsuna> any pistol, he won't use it
[3:38:27] <%joodatious> hand CONON
[3:38:33] <tanarath> Big gun
[3:38:33] <%AmericanSkidd> this barrel extension makes the laser betterer
[3:38:35] <Laecerelius> executioner?  Paladin?  he won't use it
[3:38:37] <KeystoneA2> Pistol is window dressing
[3:38:38] <williamrooster> hell use the rilfe the whole time
[3:38:38] <Sameriarix> Was that the clip mode or the spare ammo nod?  Cause they don't care about spare ammo
[3:38:40] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Penetration mod is useless on the laser rifle
[3:38:40] <bahookery> give him an asari weapon so he feels disgusted when he touches it
[3:38:42] <%peachy996> Is it cuz Woolie is always wrong and hates being told as such?
[3:38:44] <tanarath> EXECUTIONER
[3:38:45] <DatAsuna> unless you tell him to use it for funsies
[3:38:46] <blackjack8182> Acolyte
[3:38:47] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> extended mags on an infinite ammo gun is kinda moot.
[3:38:53] <blue8moon> it's even got a skull on it
[3:38:54] <%peachy996> Or is it cuz people are spoiling him on shit now
[3:39:00] <%joodatious> ammo doesn't matter for team mates
[3:39:03] <yourliteraldog> Javik hates asari?
[3:39:06] <ingman112> @peachy996 Nah it’s because people wouldn’t shut up about story spoilers
[3:39:07] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Capacity is useless on Teammates
[3:39:09] <Dunmarkh> @peachy996 that
[3:39:09] <DatAsuna> That's bullshit, I've tested the laser with piercing and it can shoot through entire walls properly built
[3:39:10] <@commanderclaw> Team mates have infinite ammo
[3:39:10] <%Alig200> @RAGING_1NF3RNO it lets it fire longer before it has to cooldown
[3:39:10] <%dawarw0lf> Make him A GOD
[3:39:13] <+OneGorillionDollars> ammo doesnt matter for squad
[3:39:15] <Aiutare47> kryse for crowd control I'd say
[3:39:17] <Laecerelius> Black widow!
[3:39:19] <%joodatious> railgun go blam
[3:39:25] <@QueequegTheater> For companions, up damage as much as possible
[3:39:26] <Dunmarkh> Make go boom
[3:39:26] <%shadowsofpain> Power and piercing ammo doesn't matter for them
[3:39:26] <%peachy996> Give him the anti material rifle
[3:39:29] <%joodatious> the javlin launcher is awsome
[3:39:30] <bahookery> nah
[3:39:32] <%jillyrancher> @queequegtheater Woolie got spoiled on Disco didnt he
[3:39:32] <@QueequegTheater> weight and ammo don't matter
[3:39:35] <%joodatious> the batarion weapon
[3:39:36] <tanarath> Uh
[3:39:36] <%toolofparanoia> kyrase for the lols
[3:39:37] <%AJ_Cherenkov> shame there's no javelin yet
[3:39:37] <GustauveVIII> The Typhoon is his sniper rifle, he has 100% accuracy with typhoon
[3:39:38] <@QueequegTheater> @jillyrancher yuuup
[3:39:38] <%dawarw0lf> Give him the Turian sniper
[3:39:39] <blackjack8182> Anti-material
[3:39:43] <%shadowsofpain> give him the black widow
[3:39:45] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt always damage for partners
[3:39:46] <%jillyrancher> aww
[3:39:49] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Teammates only need Damage
[3:39:52] <DatAsuna> @QueequegTheater My solo clear of platinum MP mode with the particle rifle in an AP build says otherwise lol
[3:39:52] <%joodatious> ammo isn't goo for teamates
[3:39:52] <%dawarw0lf> The kryase is a a Turian weapon
[3:39:52] <Sameriarix> Concentration is worthless on squaddies
[3:39:54] <@Ranryu692> I remember being super hyped when I finally got a Black Widow in the MP. That gun cleaned house
[3:39:54] <%peachy996> Oh yeah the Krysae is a Turian weapon
[3:39:56] <%Alig200> magazine capacity does matter for teammates, since they still reload.
[3:39:57] <ingman112> @jillyrancher Yeah on one of the biggest parts
[3:39:57] <%jillyrancher> some folks are assholes
[3:40:00] <Laecerelius> Oh yeah, he has AP ammo
[3:40:03] <Laecerelius> as a power
[3:40:06] <williamrooster> Give him the rauket lowncher
[3:40:07] <+DACH33ZMAN> maybe a pistol?
[3:40:07] <%aWanderingKaivo> phaeston is a Turian AR too
[3:40:09] <@QueequegTheater> @DatAsuna For combat buddies, not the player
[3:40:11] <%ComfortableStranger> @Sameriarix THIS^^
[3:40:12] <%joodatious> here we go baby
[3:40:12] <$Faustgesicht> Yeh
[3:40:13] <%jillyrancher> God that sucks
[3:40:15] <%dawarw0lf> Some mods don’t work on squadmates
[3:40:15] <%aWanderingKaivo> but not super great
[3:40:21] <Aiutare47> it does stack however
[3:40:28] <@SoFarFetched> yeah reading chat is a curse for streamers playing a new game. Because you can just glance over and suddenly see a spoiler because someone thought it was no big deal.
[3:40:28] <%joodatious> garrus BIG
[3:40:28] <%toolofparanoia> Garrus go BRRRRRRRRRRRR
[3:40:31] <tanarath> @patstaresat they stack
[3:40:32] <%peachy996> You're going to roll with the Blood Pack Pistol Pat?
[3:40:42] <%BlackStarAura> In this behemoth typhoon
[3:40:44] <@SoFarFetched> and then I get flashbacks when pat was doing his disco stream geefBruh
[3:40:44] <Sameriarix> Slam is a meme
[3:40:46] <Mcjiggyjay> @PatStaresAt i'd say just pick what you want, chat is trying make you metagame too hard
[3:40:51] <DatAsuna> @QueequegTheater Guardians are plentiful, and pat doesn't remember to use pull or suqad commands on their shields, having javik beam straight through them is more autopilot for his playstyle
[3:40:52] <yourliteraldog> GROSS 4EYED FREAK
[3:40:53] <%dawarw0lf> Pat will probably need a smg or pistol lager
[3:40:54] <%Hitman0257> Blood Dragon Armor?
[3:40:57] <%AmericanSkidd> Welcome to My Hero Acadamia
[3:41:01] <%SABiscotti> Both are good
[3:41:02] <akitanito> blood dragon armor is sick
[3:41:03] <digaogrunge> AP mod pierces objects, the ammo power does that too?
[3:41:05] <+OneGorillionDollars> @PatStaresAt how come you dont use that 1 point for incendiary ammo for the free damage
[3:41:06] <%joodatious> TOLD YOU

[3:41:15] <SaltyAzteca> HELMET STAYS ON
[3:41:15] <mikeriffic> you need it to change it in the settings
[3:41:16] <%joodatious> chat fucking lied when i said it doesn't work on those armors!
[3:41:17] <+TheBitingIrish> Is that the Dragon Age armor?
[3:41:17] <DatAsuna> @digaogrunge yes, and they stack
[3:41:17] <%Ches_Neckbeard> helmet doesn't come off DLC armor
[3:41:18] <28moogles> Sets don't lose helmets, we said
[3:41:19] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> full sets dont hide
[3:41:19] <tanarath> Damnit
[3:41:19] <Shockmaster182> Javiks the type of dude to piss on the toilet seat and not wipe it afterwards
[3:41:21] <gundamech> Helmet doesn't come off for this one.
[3:41:21] <%dawarw0lf> Some missions he does thst
[3:41:22] <Dunmarkh> based chat deceiving you?
[3:41:26] <godzookylives> Is Shepard a Cylon now?
[3:41:27] <akitanito> at least we don't get to see patshep's weird ME3 face
[3:41:28] <%jillyrancher> @datasuna Pat doesn't even have pull yet lol. I dunno why he wont use it
[3:41:29] <+dukeofhammer> KAHLEE
[3:41:31] <DatAsuna> this is why you need mods
[3:41:31] <blue8moon> you must cover your faaaaaaaaace

[3:41:36] <%dawarw0lf> This happens sometimes
[3:41:42] <%AmericanSkidd> Chat was WRONG?
[3:41:44] <28moogles> We said it doesn't come off.
[3:41:44] <%peachy996> I never said put the armor on
[3:41:45] <Mattais88> We betrayed you, everyone betrayed you
[3:41:46] <%SABiscotti> Armor sets don’t hide helmets
[3:41:46] <%dawarw0lf> We aren’t wrong
[3:41:48] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Who was the ONE GUY who told you it came off?
[3:41:48] <%peachy996> You made that decision
[3:41:49] <%whyskeywolfe> Good news - Reddit is down in Canada.
[3:41:50] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Why do you always believe in Chat
[3:41:50] <PaperyHornet1013> Reload
[3:41:50] <Ids560> I saw tons of people saying that the helmet wouldn't come off when you were buying it
[3:41:50] <murdocismyhero> Shame

[3:41:55] <GohansBeforeHohans> Blood Dragon armor is sick as fuck
[3:41:55] <yourliteraldog> Cus our parents didn't love us

[3:42:02] <%Garthunox> helmets not off cos its counted as an entire suit of armor, the helmet isnt seperate
[3:42:05] <Sameriarix> Oh god, we can't see Pat Shepard's wrinkled 30 year old face.  What will we do.
[3:42:07] <%Nobrev> we have to kill chat. it's the only way.
[3:42:08] <@SoFarFetched> You did this? CHAT did this.
[3:42:10] <%jillyrancher> that's better than nothing at least
[3:42:10] <%bassoontyphoon> psaCanada
[3:42:13] <%MidnightBurst12> more you say?
[3:42:13] <%HaroldDonchee> beep boob beep

[3:42:59] <%peachy996> Team Threesome
[3:43:01] <Ranger747> scared me
[3:43:01] <%kyh9> I remember there being an option in the menu to take the helmet off
[3:43:01] <@QueequegTheater> Somehow this is Blizzard's fault
[3:43:05] <%peachy996> I mean what?
[3:43:07] <%AmericanSkidd> Pat wins as one, chat loses as a team
[3:43:09] <%kyh9> Doe sME3 still have that option?

[3:43:14] <rytisone> Garrus has done calibrating
[3:43:15] <%Birdigalore> Garrus kinda looks like Arbiter in that armor
[3:43:16] <ingman112> DAMM YOU DIABLO
[3:43:16] <%dawarw0lf> It’s just that cutscene
[3:43:18] <%HaroldDonchee> I love the bullet shroud thing on that
[3:43:18] <Vantesla> Why Garrus helmet on? LUL
[3:43:19] <%Alig200> @kyh9 he already has it set to off in conversations iirc
[3:43:20] <Shockmaster182> You eat pieces of shit for breakfast?
[3:43:20] <%InternetShis> Javik can either breathe in space or BioWare forgot

[3:44:17] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Hardcore is the new easy btw
[3:44:19] <%peachy996> it's not consistent
[3:44:19] <@commanderclaw> This is why people said you might need to turn up the difficulty. With Garrus kitted as he is right now you can sleep through Insanity difficulty
[3:44:19] <%aWanderingKaivo> shepards arms look so weird in this armor

[3:44:30] <%strakillias> That armor look so much better without the helmet
[3:44:31] <gundamech> We were deceived
[3:44:34] <Vantesla> Should just go settings and helmets always off. instead of sometimes perhaps.
[3:44:34] <$Faustgesicht> That is so fucking wierd looking
[3:44:38] <borkmire> that clipping around the neck
[3:44:40] <%peachy996> He's on Hardcore

[3:45:06] <%Ravioli_Ronin> LUL
[3:45:07] <%DeadRuins> @PatStaresAt if there is no dialogue wheel then it's not a conversation, thus the helmet stays on
[3:45:08] <yourliteraldog> SHE GONNA SUCK HIS DICK

[3:54:42] <@TheYellowcouch> It feels like she got some marvel juice injected to her writing
[3:54:46] <%joodatious> she looks like a cyberpunk character
[3:54:46] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Omg I hate the writing that acts like you ever had any choice about working with cerverus
[3:54:46] <scrumbotime> See, the tough woman now has Children and is Soft, she is now a Developed Character

[3:57:30] <%jillyrancher> Shepard speeches
[3:57:30] <+kewlmyc> She doesn't join the team?
[3:57:35] <+vaderxyz1970> Everyone knows you put newtype biotic teenagers in mechs
[3:57:35] <AxelCezar> they really did a work to make her much more feminine and attractive
[3:57:44] <+DACH33ZMAN> oh god the neck clipping was bad there

[3:57:59] <HeroToxiko> pat*
[3:58:02] <@QueequegTheater> "And all those times you didn't pick me for the squad"
[3:58:09] <%DrTomT18> If you brought her to do the Barrier then she has slightly different dialog
[3:58:09] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt she has a special dialogue here if she did the buble
[3:58:12] <%saiko2208> Jack is so much better in this game.
[3:58:12] <GohansBeforeHohans> @kewlmyc Unfortunately not
[3:58:13] <%Monkeyweed21> @Birdigalore the scars are from the research facility she covers them mostly with tatoos

[3:58:18] <%dawarw0lf> Spoiler can happen there
[3:58:22] <%dawarw0lf> If you know
[3:58:22] <%James_Quivers> MOD ON THE LEFT
[3:58:22] <spoiledbadger> missed a thing
[3:58:24] <%toolofparanoia> upgrade!
[3:58:24] <%DeadRuins> blind
[3:58:24] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Miss Mod
[3:58:25] <Mattais88> mod behind you
[3:58:26] <%Hitman0257> mod on table
[3:58:26] <%captain_kirkhammer> missed a pickup
[3:58:27] <%DrTomT18> I always pick her to do it lmao
[3:58:29] <+GuilKato> you passed stuff ion the room
[3:58:32] <%peachy996> Lots of little things sprinkled around
[3:58:32] <+DACH33ZMAN> uh oh are you enjoying it too much?
[3:58:33] <%joodatious> LUL LUL LUL
[3:58:36] <@commanderclaw> The game is like, 90% good
[3:58:36] <%captain_kirkhammer> other left
[3:58:37] <Mcjiggyjay> weapon attachment
[3:58:37] <@QueequegTheater> Don't worry, there's shitty stuff too
[3:58:37] <RoldanDgr8> lol
[3:58:39] <%jillyrancher> Good.
[3:58:42] <%Sigma_190_Beta> Yuri Lowenthal?
[3:58:43] <DatAsuna> Liara's dialogue with her is good too, she blackmails her to shut her up
[3:58:43] <SaltyAzteca> ITS SO GOOD. SO MUCH CONTENT
[3:58:51] <IvanMistwalker> good
[3:58:52] <%peachy996> And then a big fat stinky dump at the end
[3:58:53] <%Retinolgaming> Pat hates that he likes it.
[3:58:54] <Zombrocom> Yeah it's 90% GREAT
[3:58:54] <+Troispoint> It's the best game of the series, but the one that makes me feel the worst.
[3:58:56] <%James_Quivers> STOP BEING SO GOOD, GAME, DAMN IT
[3:58:57] <%joodatious> the team really cared but got screwed over by EA.
[3:58:57] <%peachy996> Exactly
[3:58:58] <+GrizzleBearMAK> Because there's some good stuff in there. But there's some awful stuff too and not just the ending
[3:59:00] <Zombrocom> BUT THAT TEN PERCENT THOUGH
[3:59:02] <digaogrunge> BUT THE END FUCKED
[3:59:02] <Mattais88> The front half is loaded with great stuff
[3:59:02] <%dawarw0lf> There SOME shitty stuff
[3:59:04] <akitanito> that's a perfect wet fart
[3:59:04] <%DrTomT18> yeah, its weird
[3:59:05] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Wet fart ruins all the fun
[3:59:06] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Mentally move the Citadel DLC to after the ending and it fixes all of it
[3:59:07] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt the biggest thing that annoys me is that the msq feels like it's going at a breakneck speed, sorta like rise of skywalker
[3:59:07] <%Ravioli_Ronin> YUP
[3:59:09] <@ssjklyco> It's ends like How I met your Mother
[3:59:10] <%ahomeschooldropout> I did Citadel last and the final cutscene of that DLC gave me a sinking feeling in my stomach 'cause I knew what was next
[3:59:10] <+JonathLP> @PatStaresAt Now imagine playing through the first time without knowing the ending
[3:59:11] <%DrTomT18> So much effort and then a wet fart
[3:59:11] <%Agami23> its the half life of RPGs
[3:59:11] <%TheHateFish> The last half hour or so is garbage. The rest is gold.
[3:59:14] <%jillyrancher> I like this game a lot and I HATE IT
[3:59:15] <%LumberjackJack> "Mass Effect 3 is the best Mass Effect until the last level" is what I always heard
[3:59:16] <%shurtal> Pat, you're getting crotchety, drink  your juice like Jack said
[3:59:16] <penitentpendant> "Why did you dress up the steak so much then make the desert so shit?"
[3:59:18] <%joodatious> @GrizzleBearMAK the vast majority is the ending tho
[3:59:18] <+redthebaron> she gets a real upgrade from her mass effect 2 stuff
[3:59:22] <SaltyAzteca> @Zombrocom Dont think about it, it only brings back pain :(
[3:59:25] <tanarath> It's 90% fantastic and the multiplayer is AMAZING
[3:59:25] <RoldanDgr8> Citadel is the real ending
[3:59:25] <%ComfortableStranger> liara knows jacks real name
[3:59:27] <DatAsuna> Yeah there's bad stuff that's not the ending too, we'll bitch about that when you reach it
[3:59:27] <+StrikeTheErf> pat are you trying to convince yourself to not have fun
[3:59:29] <%akscully> "we told you to do this cool thing and you didn't and now you're mad"
[3:59:30] <spoiledbadger> missed a thing
[3:59:31] <28moogles> Nah, the game is great and the ending is okay. Solid game overall.
[3:59:31] <+DACH33ZMAN> past jack
[3:59:33] <+vaderxyz1970> NEW GAME PLUS FOR 3 EXTRA SECONDS ON THE ENDING

[3:59:35] <Mattais88> benchs
[3:59:36] <jbrachob> ME3 was the equivalent of the Game of Thrones and its ending
[3:59:36] <%dawarw0lf> Extended cut is ok and fixed it
[3:59:37] <LightningLynx89> Use your map 4Head
[3:59:37] <@QueequegTheater> JUST RUN
[3:59:38] <%walternatorz> you contemplated shooting the laptop earlier
[3:59:39] <+galaktic> theres a laptop down on the bottom floor
[3:59:40] <+ScrapKingKeita> extended ending is like a 3 out of 10, instead of a -3 out of 10
[3:59:40] <mikeriffic> @PatStaresAt middle of the room
[3:59:40] <+GuilKato> you have the direction indicaor thing
[3:59:40] <+CyanDeadEye> Forward to the right

[3:59:54] <Shockmaster182> I will say extended ending softens the blow a ton
[3:59:57] <%peachy996> It's like meeting this nice person and they're attractive and the sex is great. And then they just rip a hard one before the night is over
[4:00:00] <HeroToxiko> yup
[4:00:00] <%bassoontyphoon> Find Cerberus Laptop

[4:00:01] <Mattais88> Jack would be an enemy later
[4:00:02] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> yea
[4:00:02] <%joodatious> it would of been an autofail
[4:00:02] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt If you skipped Grissom Academy, Jack would've turned into an enemy you face later.
[4:00:03] <%LumberjackJack> Yup Sadge
[4:00:03] <%DrTomT18> yes, she would appear as an enemy later
[4:00:04] <%peachy996> Yes.
[4:00:05] <%xcompleasedad> @PatStaresAt She would become a soldier you kill later
[4:00:06] <%joodatious> like in 2
[4:00:07] <%shurtal> yuuuuuuup
[4:00:07] <%James_Quivers> They're here for her
[4:00:07] <Sameriarix> This is one of the only quests with a time limit, yeah
[4:00:07] <+DACH33ZMAN> i dont think she actually attacks you though
[4:00:07] <tanarath> Yes
[4:00:08] <%shadowsofpain> Yup
[4:00:08] <%akscully> yes and it's very sad
[4:00:10] <LightningLynx89> Yep
[4:00:10] <%jillyrancher> @datasuna Kai Leng and Evacuation of Thessia.
[4:00:10] <%JamesCorck> yea.
[4:00:11] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt She shows up as an enemy later on
[4:00:11] <HeroToxiko> HEY
[4:00:11] <%peachy996> You can meet her and kill her
[4:00:11] <+TristonObv> Its important to remember that ME3 was rushed in the same way as DA2
[4:00:11] <%Hitman0257> so it seems
[4:00:12] <%ComfortableStranger> she gets turned into a phantom
[4:00:13] <%Monkeyweed21> you would have new enemies to fight
[4:00:14] <%jillyrancher> psaLiz
[4:00:14] <+DACH33ZMAN> shes just dead for plot purposes
[4:00:14] <Shockmaster182> It makes the ending really fine
[4:00:14] <%ahomeschooldropout> She becomes a enemy in the final mission
[4:00:18] <%ComfortableStranger> and yo have to kill her
[4:00:18] <Mattais88> Legion too if you sell him to cerberus
[4:00:19] <DatAsuna> yeah, she just becomes a nameplate for a regular ceberus enemy though
[4:00:19] <%JamesCorck> And you fight her as a mini-Boss later.
[4:00:19] <%joodatious> there are time sensitive missions
[4:00:20] <%saiko2208> @jbrachob Damn you're right lol
[4:00:21] <+Troispoint> People who say the extended ending is fine are the people trying to tell you the prequels were good.
[4:00:22] <%peachy996> That's why Chat went nuts about it last week
[4:00:23] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Yes
[4:00:25] <%DrTomT18> If you choose Morithan over Samara she becomes an enemy in the final mission of the game
[4:00:25] <%shadowsofpain> Time for Javik
[4:00:25] <+WutangchickeN> YOU COULD HAVE KILLED JACK AND YOU LOST THE OPPORTUNITY TO KILL HER
[4:00:29] <DatAsuna> it's a half assed bad outcome
[4:00:29] <andresisant> wath mass effect is this one ?
[4:00:29] <+DACH33ZMAN> oh you do meet her?? thats kinda cool
[4:00:34] <%jillyrancher> yeah its fucked up
[4:00:39] <%walternatorz> they will panic for the 2 seconds of life remaining
[4:00:39] <DatAsuna> the real consequence is just missing her content
[4:00:40] <%joodatious> @Troispoint not even close
[4:00:40] <$Faustgesicht> Panic in the split second they die
[4:00:42] <%strakillias> Isn't it amazing that even with the wet fart of an ending this game still has alot of great content. And then they followed it up with Andromeda which has almost no redeeming qualities
[4:00:47] <+charp35> Yes then she appears as an enemy later
[4:00:47] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:00:54] <DatAsuna> running into her indoctrinated is mega underwhelming because of the lack of budget

[4:01:12] <KeystoneA2> @strakillias I've heard it has Vetra and literally nothing else lol
[4:01:12] <%joodatious> people who say the prequals are good just ignore all problems while everyone who doesn't mind the ending just care more about the game as a whole
[4:01:13] <@QueequegTheater> Huh, apparently I had Moobot blocked
[4:01:15] <Mattais88> talk to jack again

[4:01:59] <Shockmaster182> I mean the extended cut doesn’t make the ending good per say, but it at least makes it a solid 5/10.
[4:01:59] <mikeriffic> wait no its not a bug
[4:01:59] <%dawarw0lf> Is Paige playing
[4:01:59] <williamrooster> Humanity's best hope

[4:02:28] <%Kay_Tana> Pat are you okay?
[4:02:30] <DatAsuna> @strakillias it also has a good krogan grandpa, the other pathfinders are a lot more interesting than ryder too. The game does an okay job of bringing back a lot of ME1 stuff than 2/3 gave up on too like exploration/dynamic cover .etc
[4:02:32] <SaltyAzteca> Tv PG
[4:02:34] <@TheYellowcouch> Wait she stops herself from swearing now?

[4:02:38] <%DrTomT18> Javik being kind?
[4:02:39] <%NateyBeak> wait did jack say anything about the walking missing link just walking around
[4:02:41] <+Troispoint> Mass Effect 3 makes you run around in a room quite a lot it's odd.

[4:03:35] <digaogrunge> Phat Neck Pat
[4:03:37] <%toolofparanoia> THIS GAME IS FULL OF GOOD LINES
[4:03:37] <%joodatious> this map is actually fun
[4:03:46] <%AmericanSkidd> oh boy here we go killing again
[4:03:47] <%castlerock42> This fight fucking sucks on insanity.
[4:03:49] <%jillyrancher> Watch Pat die
[4:03:49] <%ComfortableStranger> @joodatious only if its a dude
[4:03:52] <+Qexec> This room is fucked on insanity.
[4:03:54] <KeystoneA2> Did you know your teammates get stuck behind that door you came through quite often
[4:03:58] <%NopeBadguy> garrus knows that garrus is going to kill you
[4:04:01] <%DrTomT18> Garrus "The God" Vicarran
[4:04:02] <%Garthunox> if you go renegade there she chews her out saying "look at my scars, cerberus did this to me!"
[4:04:10] <DatAsuna> that right there is why piercing on javik woulda been handy lol
[4:04:20] <+TristonObv> This arena is crazy hard for this early
[4:04:21] <%akscully> all right, that armor does look dope as hell
[4:04:22] <%joodatious> @joodatious girl bi'ish is even more evil
[4:04:23] <blue8moon> barely even have a chance to use your powers with these guns LUL
[4:04:23] <dekkitout> "I'm going to eat the snacks Jack gave me while Garrus annihilates you"
[4:04:24] <stantheman_97> man jack in 3 is such an improvement
[4:04:28] <TCDerps> turret
[4:04:29] <+bugz_munny> bold
[4:04:29] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[4:04:29] <rytisone> still managed to die
[4:04:29] <KeystoneA2> Turret still MVP
[4:04:30] <@QueequegTheater> Piercing doesn't work on laser weapons
[4:04:30] <%LumberjackJack> LUL It's the turrets again
[4:04:30] <Aiutare47> not again!
[4:04:30] <Javier9563> turrets are fucked
[4:04:31] <%peachy996> Turret Wins!
[4:04:31] <%DrTomT18> @Garthunox Being casualy renegade while being Hard paragon is always gun
[4:04:32] <Laecerelius> Turret wins again!
[4:04:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> You did it again
[4:04:34] <+ayywood> interesting choice to rush the mech
[4:04:35] <%joodatious> turrets fuck hard
[4:04:35] <Latija> the turrets strike again
[4:04:37] <%akscully> except for the death
[4:04:40] <DarkestDom> LUL
[4:04:40] <spoiledbadger> dont bum rush turrets
[4:04:41] <%DrTomT18> yeah Pat don't charge into mini guns
[4:04:41] <zhenthrim213> Turret effect
[4:04:43] <%Sigma_190_Beta> Turrets fuck.
[4:04:43] <Profmcstevie> Strongest arsenal in the galaxy, still a bad player
[4:04:44] <%jillyrancher> Oh my God
[4:04:44] <%dawarw0lf> Turret will still kill you
[4:04:44] <%miguelrod777> just charge what could go wrong
[4:04:45] <digaogrunge> turrets hurt
[4:04:46] <%Ches_Neckbeard> Pat just full unga bunga into turrets after going blind. It's like watching Paige
[4:04:46] <%ComfortableStranger> turits should be taken care of at a distance first
[4:04:47] <%peachy996> TURRET STILL GOT SOME SPUNK
[4:04:48] <%RJay80> turrent chan hiding
[4:04:48] <akitanito> easy mode you guys say
[4:04:48] <+Troispoint> It's the hardest fight in that mission
[4:04:49] <%JamesCorck> Pat don't feel bad if you die 50 times in this part, it's a fucking nightmare.
[4:04:50] <Laecerelius> They should just replace all Cerberus operatives with turrets
[4:04:50] <%SABiscotti> Javik did a fatality
[4:04:50] <%jillyrancher> I KNEW IT LOL
[4:04:52] <+DACH33ZMAN> turrets > reapers tbh
[4:04:55] <%aWanderingKaivo> know what would kill those turrets easily? one of those upgraded longer range guns you bought..
[4:04:56] <%DrTomT18> Turrets: Hard counter to Vanguard
[4:04:57] <KeystoneA2> Virgin Vanguard vs Chad Turret
[4:05:06] <DatAsuna> the auto targeting actually makes smoke grenades more effective in this game than most shooters and that's funny
[4:05:06] <akitanito> turrets > shepcoin
[4:05:07] <yourliteraldog> turrets in this game fuck engineer has some good ones
[4:05:13] <williamrooster> alot of engineers in this part
[4:05:18] <%dawarw0lf> Pat needs a second gun I think
[4:05:18] <DatAsuna> I still hate that they broke the rapid melee in LE
[4:05:20] <%jillyrancher> Turret senpai pls no
[4:05:21] <SaltyAzteca> Hardcore baybeeeeeeeeeee
[4:05:21] <%DrTomT18> "Our troops to afraid to fight Shepard because he keeps melting them
[4:05:26] <%toolofparanoia> HEAL
[4:05:27] <%joodatious> you should get a shotgun  melee attachment sometime
[4:05:28] <penitentpendant> Turret go brr
[4:05:35] <blue8moon> oh my god pat healed himself, it's a miracle
[4:05:35] <DatAsuna> And it turns out there's save import bugs for stuff like conrad and jacob now too
[4:05:35] <KeystoneA2> Garrus is stuck in the hallway.
[4:05:38] <PaperyHornet1013> Turrets > cheats
[4:05:44] <+OneGorillionDollars> I think garrus got stuck LUL
[4:05:45] <%jillyrancher> I noticed that Asuna. fucking sucks.
[4:05:50] <TheAntiNihilist> Woooow 1 miwwion twoops
[4:05:52] <DatAsuna> not that jacob matters much but still, LE should fix bugs, not add new ones
[4:06:02] <%DrTomT18> The Reger Carbine is probably classifed as a shot gun because if it was long range it would break the game
[4:06:03] <%aWanderingKaivo> oh yeah I forgot cerberus brings those shield stations in single player
[4:06:09] <DatAsuna> Like you still can't respec javik without mods
[4:06:09] <dekkitout> At this point Shep is leashing Garry
[4:06:11] <%joodatious> perfect
[4:06:11] <penitentpendant> Turret GO BRRRRRRRRR
[4:06:11] <SaltyAzteca> SWISS CHEESE
[4:06:13] <Dunmarkh> turrets are fun
[4:06:13] <%toolofparanoia> TURRETS!
[4:06:14] <%NitronStreams> YEAH
[4:06:14] <AngryAsian5> Turrets. Get you everytime LUL
[4:06:15] <%peachy996> having the beam on Javik is handy since it lets you see where he is
[4:06:15] <%James_Quivers> 1 MIRRION TROOBS
[4:06:15] <%ComfortableStranger> Does pat know he can roll cancel nova for extra Iframes?
[4:06:15] <LightningLynx89> Yeah those turrets fuck
[4:06:16] <%jillyrancher> ME3 has a surprising number of bugs in the LE
[4:06:16] <SkinnyRite> BBBRRRRRAAPAPAOW
[4:06:16] <%Birdigalore> RAT-A-TAT-TAT
[4:06:16] <thewrathofscience> LUL
[4:06:16] <%joodatious> epic gamer moves
[4:06:16] <%LumberjackJack> Turret > Vanguard LUL
[4:06:17] <Laecerelius> Whoops, turret wins again!
[4:06:17] <zhenthrim213> fucking rinsed
[4:06:17] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt Manually place garrus, it might be easier
[4:06:20] <Profmcstevie> When will you leeeearn~
[4:06:22] <spoiledbadger> turrets go brrr
[4:06:23] <%joodatious> literally BRRR
[4:06:24] <KeiPrime> lit up
[4:06:24] <Javier9563> I died so many times in insanity during this part it wasn't even funny
[4:06:25] <Aiutare47> the purpose of turrets is to force you into cover, they are a vanguards hard counter
[4:06:25] <%jillyrancher> its obvious it had the least work
[4:06:25] <akitanito> I guess cerberus weren't wrong
[4:06:25] <%DrTomT18> Do. not. bum. rush. turrets.
[4:06:26] <%ComfortableStranger> clearly not
[4:06:26] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> That was a Partyt
[4:06:28] <%dawarw0lf> You need a long range gun for them
[4:06:28] <@goose_attack_almanac> those turrets are the biggest counter to vanguard and it made infiltrator so much more fun
[4:06:29] <+Troispoint> The turrets are the realest threat in this game
[4:06:29] <%LumberjackJack> Anyone
[4:06:30] <IvanMistwalker> turrets fuck
[4:06:33] <@QueequegTheater> I'm fairly certain Garrus could solo this
[4:06:35] <%DrTomT18> you really need to get a pistol to take out turrets
[4:06:37] <%DashXero> Man... Pat has a really risky play style.
[4:06:42] <digaogrunge> this is one of the hardest rooms in the game
[4:06:42] <DatAsuna> using squads commands to pop turret shields nullifies them
[4:06:42] <satans_finest_millennial> its aaaaaallll coming back to me now. this room is hell
[4:06:43] <%LumberjackJack> Anyone else's audio get muted when he uses the Reegar?
[4:06:46] <%bassoontyphoon> Pat gets perforated at
[4:06:47] <%peachy996> Illusive Man must be thinking "Hmmm send more turrets"
[4:06:48] <+bugz_munny> shoot da mech
[4:06:48] <%Ravioli_Ronin> They’re so bad in multiplayer
[4:06:50] <yourliteraldog> did he only bring the shotgun?
[4:06:51] <+GuilKato> kill big robot?
[4:06:52] <%dawarw0lf> Pistol…or the venom
[4:06:56] <PaperyHornet1013> Will pat die to anything other than turrets?
[4:07:02] <%DrTomT18> If only you had a long range asset. Like, I dunno. a pistol
[4:07:02] <Shockmaster182> This is really funny, I did infiltrator during my last run and made turrets my fucking bitch
[4:07:07] <+TristonObv> This is hands down the hardest fight in the base game
[4:07:09] <%jillyrancher> Pat's literally more overpowered than anyone should be and still dying XD
[4:07:09] <DatAsuna> double turret
[4:07:13] <%James_Quivers> I take back what I said earlier, turns out you don't need to increase the difficulty at all, lmao
[4:07:13] <%joodatious> why pat..
[4:07:13] <Dunmarkh> jesus
[4:07:14] <%DrTomT18> also, Shockwave
[4:07:15] <DatAsuna> big brain setup on the engineer's part
[4:07:16] <%Solid_Stro> All the money and upgrades in the world can’t save you from the turrets Pat
[4:07:16] <%toolofparanoia> Garrus FUCKS
[4:07:16] <Aiutare47> cmon man
[4:07:16] <%joodatious> u have gun
[4:07:18] <mr_saturday93> gg
[4:07:19] <%joodatious> use gun
[4:07:19] <spoiledbadger> brrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[4:07:19] <%DrTomT18> you should invest in shock wave
[4:07:19] <Shockmaster182> Love how the classes each have their own counters and shit
[4:07:21] <%heyitsbrian> heyitsbrian subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months! YO maybe I missed the why, but what's this about you tweeting about wanting to learn dnd?
[4:07:21] <penitentpendant> Turret continues to go BRRR
[4:07:21] <DatAsuna> turrets wtaching turrets
[4:07:23] <Aiutare47> turrets dont stagger
[4:07:23] <%peachy996> Engineers reenforce turrets
[4:07:23] <Laecerelius> Turret wins again!
[4:07:26] <yourliteraldog> not the wisest move to rush the turret
[4:07:26] <+RowenCleric> shepard splats so fast
[4:07:28] <%walternatorz> mhmm
[4:07:28] <TheIronBrass> LUL
[4:07:29] <@QueequegTheater> CAN'T CHEAT THE TURRET
[4:07:29] <%miguelrod777> just shoot them pat you have strong guns
[4:07:29] <%Sigma_190_Beta> Wow, running into Double Turret is amazing.
[4:07:32] <@ssjklyco> Use your money as a shield
[4:07:32] <%ahomeschooldropout> You should probably bring a pistol to deal with the turrets
[4:07:33] <%shadowsofpain> Two turrets equals you don't get to have fun
[4:07:34] <shameimarusen> Deaded
[4:07:35] <%peachy996> You should have had the Typhoon
[4:07:35] <+RowenCleric> like his ragdoll just yeets
[4:07:36] <%DrTomT18> everyone, take a shot when pat dies to a turret
[4:07:37] <28moogles> Since your power is close ranged, you should probably pick a long range gun
[4:07:37] <%RetroCop87> Keep charging those turrets, Pat. Someday, you'll beat 'em
[4:07:38] <%jillyrancher> Lol
[4:07:38] <%BlackStarAura> So smart
[4:07:38] <+ayywood> glass cannon build
[4:07:39] <%NopeBadguy> maybe try not punching the turret
[4:07:41] <yourliteraldog> overload them
[4:07:42] <mikeriffic> Engineers are priority always
[4:07:43] <$ainzhelm> YOU GOT KNOCKED THE FUCK OUT
[4:07:46] <%DrTomT18> YOU CAN. GET A PISTOL
[4:07:46] <%joodatious> turrets know you cheated pat
[4:07:48] <stantheman_97> why do you keep charging turrets?
[4:07:51] <%DrTomT18> SHOOT IT
[4:07:51] <El_GhostV1> There’s one rule in ME3, don’t fuck with the turret
[4:07:51] <Explodincatz> guys why is Pat dying?
[4:07:56] <%Scevda> Turrets dont care about how many credits you have
[4:07:57] <yeildingthought> LUL I love that for all pat’s “whaling” the turrets are still a problem
[4:07:57] <%Solid_Stro> This is fine
[4:08:02] <%dawarw0lf> Turrets are immune to your big money
[4:08:08] <%jillyrancher> they arent that overpowered even Pat is just so reckless
[4:08:09] <anAngryHamster> I thing going balls deep is not as effective as it was in 2
[4:08:11] <Profmcstevie> I guess it's not pay to win huh Kappa
[4:08:21] <akitanito> is it time to cheat engine health
[4:08:27] <%aWanderingKaivo> garrus, turret destroyer
[4:08:29] <%YakumoYomi> Garrus IS a monster. Technically.
[4:08:30] <+dukeofhammer> He is now
[4:08:33] <%ComfortableStranger> @anAngryHamster it is if you know what you''re doing
[4:08:34] <Laecerelius> I mean he IS a monster.  YOUR monster
[4:08:38] <%dawarw0lf> Look at that
[4:08:40] <%aWanderingKaivo> grenade pat
[4:08:41] <%peachy996> Does Garrus have the Typhoon on?
[4:08:42] <spoiledbadger> grenade
[4:08:43] <%walternatorz> there was a grenade
[4:08:43] <Aiutare47> grenade
[4:08:44] <Dunmarkh> they threw a grenade
[4:08:45] <@QueequegTheater> Grenade lol
[4:08:46] <Johndagger17> grenade
[4:08:50] <PaperyHornet1013> Can you cheat in infinite medigel?
[4:08:50] <penitentpendant> @Scevda Turrets went full Communist, bonus damage against the Bourgeoisie
[4:08:51] <%LumberjackJack> Grenade popped your shields, then soldiers almost killed ya
[4:08:53] <%Rumbutt> health go down
[4:08:53] <%ComfortableStranger> PAT ROLL CANCEL NOVA
[4:08:54] <DatAsuna> @Explodincatz turrets make for dangerous area denial so you can't be out in the open along their sight lines. They also have shields and armour which require 2 different types of attack to counter well, and vanguards pretty much only have biotics
[4:08:55] <kuningaz45> where is Elmo
[4:08:56] <28moogles> you just sat on a grenade
[4:08:56] <@QueequegTheater> RAAAAAAAGH
[4:09:01] <+Troispoint> There are 2 flanks at all times on this map
[4:09:02] <spoiledbadger> pat very blind today
[4:09:05] <%ComfortableStranger> FREE I-FRAMES
[4:09:08] <+Troispoint> So you gotta keep moving tbh
[4:09:08] <$ainzhelm> Really pat?
[4:09:10] <+kewlmyc> Damn, took a rocket launcher to the face
[4:09:11] <%dawarw0lf> The big call of duty indicateer for gernade
[4:09:31] <%peachy996> In his defense this is a silly room
[4:09:34] <%jillyrancher> turrets are way easier to deal with as soldiers Inflitrator Engineer or Sentinel
[4:09:35] <+bugz_munny> holy shit lol
[4:09:35] <%joodatious> the AI is surprisingly competent
[4:09:40] <+DACH33ZMAN> REEEEEGEEEERRR
[4:09:53] <+bugz_munny> HURRRRRRDURRRR
[4:09:54] <+DACH33ZMAN> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:09:54] <Dave_VD> Man Vanguard really is the fucking sickest. I'm doing a soldier playthrough rn and I miss charge so much
[4:09:55] <%YakumoYomi> RIP
[4:09:55] <@QueequegTheater> LUL
[4:09:56] <spoiledbadger> oof

[4:10:03] <+haitakaa> gg
[4:10:04] <LightningLynx89> So bad
[4:10:04] <%peachy996> Which Pat seems to have LUL
[4:10:05] <%Monkeyweed21> LUL
[4:10:07] <BurdRightsActivist> LMAO BAD
[4:10:07] <@ssjklyco> Hardcore is new normal
[4:10:08] <BurdRightsActivist> LUL
[4:10:08] <%akscully> ahhhhh please heal
[4:10:09] <%RJay80> grunts
[4:10:10] <DatAsuna> @ComfortableStranger well also don't use nova in the first place when flanked/in a crossfire
[4:10:10] <rytisone> there's always easy mode
[4:10:11] <Aiutare47> Once he gets someone with sabotage it will get much easier, in the mean time, dont rush high DPS shit
[4:10:11] <+Troispoint> Take your time
[4:10:13] <yourliteraldog> dose garrus have the hack power?
[4:10:16] <tanarath> too face
[4:10:18] <+Troispoint> You're in too much of a hurry!
[4:10:21] <%jillyrancher> Cerberus units work really well together
[4:10:21] <%JamesCorck> The good part of this game is that enemies don't re-spawn endlessly.
[4:10:21] <%aWanderingKaivo> yeah this room is great for an infiltrator
[4:10:23] <%captain_kirkhammer> is this whaty the children mean by KAPPA
[4:10:24] <sougoe> the only thing stronger than turrets is greed
[4:10:29] <+DACH33ZMAN> @Troispoint only tali does
[4:10:31] <%bassoontyphoon> psaPat psaPat psaPat
[4:10:32] <%JamesCorck> So it's possible to clear the room, but it just takes time.
[4:10:33] <%aWanderingKaivo> or anyone using a sniper
[4:10:37] <Profmcstevie> You've got no range and melt in proximity LUL
[4:10:45] <DatAsuna> also is javik just not using dark channel on his own? I haven't noticed it lol
[4:10:51] <Shockmaster182> MORTIS
[4:10:54] <PaperyHornet1013> Mass effect 3 has all time great enemy ai
[4:10:57] <%shadowsofpain> I think a light weight pistol would help your build a bit
[4:10:59] <+bugz_munny> I think its the rockets from the mech
[4:11:05] <+OneGorillionDollars> LOL
[4:11:05] <@QueequegTheater> BONK
[4:11:06] <+RowenCleric> krogan rushing in and headbutting never got old in mp
[4:11:10] <%joodatious> smoke actually obscures
[4:11:13] <penitentpendant> Javik go splat
[4:11:14] <%AmericanSkidd> I took yall with me into the bathroom while I take a dump, enjoy knowing that
[4:11:14] <Shatterthought> oh this part ruuKek
[4:11:16] <DatAsuna> the AI is big dumb without orders yeah
[4:11:16] <%dawarw0lf> Smoke will stop stuff
[4:11:17] <%jillyrancher> It's sad this game has combat a million times better than Anthem
[4:11:24] <CryHavoc_12> That grenade clinked off pats had lmao
[4:11:25] <%aWanderingKaivo> @RowenCleric GRAAHAHA
[4:11:26] <+CyanDeadEye> D-Pad Left to command Garrus to focus on a target
[4:11:26] <mr_saturday93> DAMN\
[4:11:27] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[4:11:28] <Aiutare47> grenade
[4:11:28] <akitanito> that revive was awkward
[4:11:32] <%peachy996> There we go
[4:11:33] <%joodatious> told ya partical gun is great
[4:11:36] <%toolofparanoia> THANKS GARRUS AND JAVIK
[4:11:38] <+Troispoint> Smoke grenades are so strong it's weird
[4:11:41] <Vantesla> It's good you didn't do insanity. Or we never make it if you played like this constantly LUL Just playing, but Pat take a bit of time if need SeemsGood
[4:11:55] <%peachy996> Garrus and Javik are nukes but the trickiness is making their ai do the big good
[4:11:57] <Dunmarkh> YAY CREDITS
[4:11:59] <shameimarusen> Javik was pissed
[4:12:06] <%jillyrancher> compare the enemies in here to Anthem and its depressing they took so many steps back
[4:12:12] <+DACH33ZMAN> YEEEEEEEE REEGEEER
[4:12:16] <%captain_kirkhammer> @DrTomT18 no
[4:12:18] <%joodatious> @DrTomT18 no shut up
[4:12:20] <DatAsuna> @Troispoint it's kinda refreshing tbh, since in most games they barely impair you at all
[4:12:21] <%jillyrancher> @drtomt18 no and spoilers
[4:12:26] <%James_Quivers> Best counter to the enigeers is to just beat their ass before they set up
[4:12:29] <%joodatious> @DrTomT18 dont fucking spoil shit

[4:13:02] <%aWanderingKaivo> @jillyrancher enemy design in me3 really is pretty nice, they work together quite well to force players to keep moving
[4:13:05] <Vantesla> GG
[4:13:06] <DatAsuna> TBF pat already said he was there before he started the mission, he's not gonna be surprised
[4:13:06] <%peachy996> This is a curb stomp battle but on both sides
[4:13:15] <+Troispoint> @DatAsuna It would be too easy to beat Cerberus if they didn't have it. So it makes sense that way.

[4:18:03] <dekkitout> Is the ending that bungled?

[4:18:21] <%strakillias> Pro tip, you actually can snipe the pilots out of these mech. Sometimes its hard to do because your dps just kills it first
[4:18:30] <@QueequegTheater> @mikeriffic you can hijack them and there's no model for the unbroken one
[4:18:30] <%Alig200> @mikeriffic probably why the engineer got out, to fix it?

[4:19:27] <%Alig200> @HotSauceFiend the yellow bar is the mechs armor, at the bottom
[4:19:28] <%HaroldDonchee> man that guy got it rough
[4:19:30] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat You can literally blow heads off in this game too
[4:19:33] <%dawarw0lf> You finally can have a armor health bar
[4:19:35] <luftkrake> they should really just turn around
[4:19:36] <+CyanDeadEye> @HotSauceFiend No, but you're pretty tanky.
[4:19:39] <DatAsuna> javik really just doesn't wanna use dark channel on his own, does he?
[4:19:41] <anAngryHamster> Aerosolized that man
[4:19:47] <%peachy996> mmmmmmmm

[4:19:57] <%Taisuru> @strakillias We must acquire all of the Ns for woolie
[4:19:58] <DatAsuna> oh, now he uses it just to spite me thanks AI lol
[4:19:58] <+Kduff89> TITANFALL TIME
[4:19:58] <%peachy996> Nevermind
[4:19:58] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Mech off
[4:19:59] <%joodatious> the IM has been indoctrinated for a VERY long time
[4:19:59] <akitanito> mech vs mech
[4:20:01] <Reveresao> Makes no sense how they have this many people also.
[4:20:01] <Laecerelius> ROBOT FIIIIIGH!!!
[4:20:01] <luftkrake> mech fight!
[4:20:03] <Laecerelius> Or not
[4:20:04] <+DACH33ZMAN> garrus and javik fuck so hard my lord
[4:20:04] <+bugz_munny> I mean if you're gonna go you might as well be vaporized instantly
[4:20:05] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[4:20:06] <spoiledbadger> WOW
[4:20:07] <%dawarw0lf> @datasuna Does pat even have “squadmate use powers” on?
[4:20:10] <%AmericanSkidd> melted
[4:20:11] <tanarath> They started at secret warcrimes, Pat.
[4:20:13] <mikeriffic> no, just garrus vs mech
[4:20:15] <%Hitman0257> BECOME AS GODS
[4:20:16] <%HotSauceFiend> It seems like Cerberus should have outfitted their men better. THey spent billions on reviving Sheppard you'd think they'd give mechas to their soldiers as well
[4:20:17] <Armadelus> That guys shit became a pink mist
[4:20:17] <Laecerelius> Dammit, Garrus, you're too strong!
[4:20:19] <PaperyHornet1013> Imagine if they all placed turrets
[4:20:20] <@goose_attack_almanac> It was nice of them to make Soldiers useful in this game
[4:20:21] <%jillyrancher> Illusive Man is super indoctrinated
[4:20:23] <CryHavoc_12> Javik and Garrus fucked the Mech.
[4:20:24] <mikeriffic> God i wish i knew to give that to Garuss on my insanity run
[4:20:25] <Shatterthought> did garrus ascend to godhood
[4:20:26] <mikeriffic> never did it
[4:20:27] <dekkitout> What's the saying? "It's probably more profitable to invest in awesome mechs, than to want to take over the universe?"
[4:20:27] <%peachy996> It'll make sense later on in the story
[4:20:28] <mr_saturday93> He brought both javik and farrus what you guys expect?
[4:20:31] <@QueequegTheater> @dawarw0lf Yes, Javik keeps using his DoT
[4:20:33] <mikeriffic> but i also never cheated credits.....hmmmm
[4:20:36] <DatAsuna> @dawarw0lf unless pat hit the command manually, I thinkI just say a cast go off
[4:20:39] <DatAsuna> but only one

[4:20:41] <+MrATheGreat> fcukin rodriguez man
[4:20:50] <GustauveVIII> @PatStaresAt You can hijack most ATLAS mechs by shooting the glass and killing the pilot with high-caliber weapons. Easiest with sniper rifles.

[4:21:03] <+vaderxyz1970> Shame you can't keep it and upgrade it throughout the game
[4:21:03] <DatAsuna> why would you not just shoot them on the ground? lol
[4:21:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> no wonder they can't kill anyone
[4:21:11] <%afronooch> space glass no ouchie

[4:23:26] <%SirGO0SE> she said fart D:
[4:23:26] <%Puhff> Why doesn't he call him Steve, like a normal human?
[4:23:27] <Tracazoid> Then there was 5 straight minutes of expletive's too mature even for an M rated game.
[4:23:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> never seen anything about this game, ever, huh, coolio for seth
[4:23:30] <+snurtlord> i thought andersons hat had the monster energy logo on it
