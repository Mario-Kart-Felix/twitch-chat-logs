[0:51:23] <$Rashnam> pinball time
[0:51:25] <@SoFarFetched> wow rank 13 pat
[0:51:26] <HitchhikingThrough> @SoFarFetched no problem
[0:51:31] <HitchhikingThrough> Just finished up mission 5 of LDK mod
[0:51:31] <+ALazo> you are a blight!
[0:51:35] <zeif00> Ruin+Undying is borderline OP
[0:51:36] <%Faustgesicht> isn't blight kinda garbage?
[0:51:41] <HitchhikingThrough> DMC5 Spite edition's development continues
[0:51:42] <@SoFarFetched> yeah anniversary
[0:51:45] <%Anime_Flux> 2-3 months ago
[0:51:45] <%Jeemukun> BRING THEM NURGLE'S GIFTS
[0:51:50] <+CptDouglasJFalcon> hex undying is absolutely bonkers yeah
[0:51:51] <%Sora20030c> he's not the best, but he is fun IMO
[0:51:51] <zeif00> blight is good
[0:51:53] <$Dakuu75> I remember something about golden-sparkles revealing ppl
[0:51:53] <+Link232> B;ogjt
[0:51:55] <VritraReiRei> I dont know much about Dead By Deadlight. Did a new update come out recently?
[0:51:56] <ShineTheDiamond> What's the Blight's schtick? He seems twitchy
[0:51:59] <+Link232> Blight's alright, but boring; and short
[0:51:59] <%Sora20030c> you literally sprint all across the mask
[0:52:01] <%Sora20030c> *map
[0:52:04] <+caramelatte1> Yup
[0:52:09] <%TheActuallyGuy> @PatStaresAt Have you played since they've added cross platform support?
[0:52:10] <@SoFarFetched> @VritraReiRei new killer/survivor,along with some update models,maps.
[0:52:11] <+DonnieAdonis> Blight looks like a flood
[0:52:21] <%Sora20030c> I like detection perks on him, because he has a lot of movement
[0:52:22] <+SpareKeese> Pinball?
[0:52:29] <Decarcassor> Some say blight is good some say blight is bad. My take is that blight is carried by the new Hex: Undying + Ruin combo and stomp noobs.
[0:52:37] <%miabyte> unless you find undying
[0:52:37] <@SoFarFetched> He plays like a pinball cause you gotta keep bumping into stuff to go farther.
[0:52:46] <%knivhands> Not busted, just a great way to slow down gens, but definitely, detection perks help SO MUCH
[0:52:49] <+SpareKeese> Ooohhhh
[0:53:01] <zeif00> New tinkerer also good
[0:53:01] <@SoFarFetched> You'll see once Pat gets into gameplay.
[0:53:02] <%knivhands> Tinkerer is great on him
[0:53:13] <acid_pit1> blights the best between going between loops
[0:53:14] <+dezimaly> woolie owned up about you being a better V fighter
[0:53:21] <@SoFarFetched> wow Pat.
[0:53:27] <%knivhands> If you haven't seen Blight, man, you're in for a treat when he gets in a match psaWink
[0:53:36] <%nmaten> too bad its a dead franchise
[0:53:42] <Mr_Strut> ture
[0:53:47] <@SoFarFetched> Virtua Fighter lives on in Yakuza games.
[0:53:53] <OperatorJo_> true
[0:53:54] <zeif00> Look for the add on that reveals survivor auras when you bump into shit too
[0:53:58] <+Rofiarf> what about DOA
[0:53:58] <+Superspider51> "unpopular good ass fighting game" that's a weird way to say MVCI
[0:53:59] <%Br0kuyasu> prob run im all ears over spirit fury, people pre drop pallets a lot against blight
[0:54:00] <$Quality_Debauchery> wow very manly of woolie
[0:54:03] <californaya> I am like the 2nd best WWE All Stars player in the world. For what that's worth.
[0:54:04] <%Aleate> My Blight is 38 without a single match played tfuC
[0:54:05] <%TheWinged7> Jus like everything you love, its dead
[0:54:06] <%Ranryu692> play it with Woolie via Parsec. We'll watch
[0:54:06] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah those are new addons.
[0:54:08] <acid_pit1> rancor may be good on him never tried it
[0:54:08] <+dezimaly> the orb contains all emotions
[0:54:19] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> I thought VF is DOA now.
[0:54:30] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Many battles
[0:54:34] <@SoFarFetched> There's like new addons to let you know where killer shack is. Survivors get one's that let the basement spawn in killer shack.

[0:57:42] <$Dakuu75> I don't understand
[0:57:46] <%Anime_Flux> these survivors are unperturbed
[0:57:53] <thetrashman_sc> there has to be a twist
[0:57:55] <%miabyte> yeah I haven't touched him yet because fuck that noise

[0:58:09] <%WhereIsWill> i seen umbra go HARD AF with blight bro
[0:58:10] <%Dementedpenguin> @Dakuu75 he basically can bounce from object to object. It's....... something
[0:58:10] <huskarl_zap> rakshasa extra thimb
[0:58:11] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Blight is definitely someone you gotta memorize maps with.
[0:58:12] <%AnIcedCoffee> Blight is currently my favourite killer
[0:58:15] <ManfredA> Blight is much better than Demo
[0:58:19] <+GrampsGrubberfly> new patch has some performance issues
[0:58:22] <%Sora20030c> if you play him right, he's basically just constant gen pressure
[0:58:24] <thetrashman_sc> hes actually really good, but very hard to use
[0:58:28] <+chungomungo> this doesn't seem like a good map for this killer
[0:58:32] <ManfredA> if you're good at Blight, then a survivor is dead if they leave a loop
[0:58:32] <%Sora20030c> because of how fast he can travel between gens
[0:58:33] <%themanski_90> themanski_90 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[0:58:33] <%DedlokPM> @TylerRich117 Correction. 5 fingers, 1 thumb. psaWhat
[0:58:38] <$QueequegTheater> Why would you run at 4K while streaming
[0:58:44] <%Sora20030c> he *sucks* in loops though
[0:58:45] <studleydoorite> I'm hard but good to use
[0:58:46] <huskarl_zap> Bill! PogChamp
[0:58:50] <@SoFarFetched> Pat's gotta rub all the rust off.

[0:59:01] <+SausageShogun> LUL
[0:59:03] <+SpareKeese> BUSH
[0:59:04] <$Dakuu75> @Dementedpenguin so instead of running straight for the survivor he has to bank his shots like he's playing Pool? lol
[0:59:06] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[0:59:07] <thetrashman_sc> you had that hit lmao
[0:59:07] <%AnIcedCoffee> Haddonfield is one of his hardest maps too
[0:59:07] <$Quality_Debauchery> bumbling around
[0:59:08] <boomstickery> like a bulldog on hard wood floors
[0:59:10] <+dezimaly> fucked up on the perfect straight away LUL
[0:59:14] <huskarl_zap> Bill apparently not fucking canon dead.
[0:59:18] <$QueequegTheater> Leave Bill alone
[0:59:23] <+Saphy115> also this is haddonfield
[0:59:24] <ShineTheDiamond> The extra pinky is freaky. Why, out of all the gross stuff in this game, does the finger make me uncomfortable?
[0:59:26] <@SoFarFetched> "Practice Match" Pat LUL
[0:59:30] <+Pookiedaexzile> I'm just here to say Woolie is Playing Virtua Fighter 4....using the Arcade in JUDGEMENT
[0:59:32] <%Broand> Woolie is playing Virtua fighter 5 by playing it as the judgement minigame
[0:59:37] <%R3Roundabout> This character is high skill for low reward
[0:59:38] <+dezimaly> was that Bill?
[0:59:38] <%Anime_Flux> aoooOoaoaaaoo
[0:59:38] <+DonnieAdonis> Ghost Bill
[0:59:43] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah that's bill from L4D
[0:59:49] <heartlesshealer> oh boy
[0:59:49] <%Dementedpenguin> @Dakuu75 honestly, I haven't played him yet, just going by what I've seen or read....so I'm not the best one to ask. LUL
[0:59:51] <%DedlokPM> @Dakuu75 after 1st bonk he can attack in all of his subsequent dashes until he stops/runs out of charges
[0:59:52] <count_bob> Go back to Pyramid Head,
[0:59:54] <DianaTheAscian> thats sad
[0:59:55] <+Ilpala> who even is this killer

[0:59:57] <zeif00> LUL
[0:59:58] <%Sora20030c> I still refuse to call it judgement, Judge Eyes is a better title to me
[0:59:59] <%juxtest> Got him
[1:00:02] <%coreyyotto> The true Virtua Fighter experience
[1:00:07] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt So aside from Silent Hill-based favoritism, which killer would you say is your main
[1:00:21] <%DedlokPM> @Ilpala Original. AKA not based on any movie. Called The Blight
[1:00:25] <smartiger117> is blight from blightown?
[1:00:27] <+SpareKeese> wow

[1:00:42] <ManfredA> there's an add on for it
[1:00:42] <%Sora20030c> I don't think he can do that
[1:00:43] <ECRead> addon
[1:00:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> fucking virtua fighter 5 being played through Judgement on ps4
[1:00:45] <ManfredA> not in base kit
[1:00:46] <Mr_Strut> You hit the fence
[1:00:49] <%miabyte> L4D2 got that new update coming
[1:00:49] <%Sora20030c> OH SHIT HE CAN

[1:00:57] <+SausageShogun> PogChamp
[1:00:58] <ptmpopulatethemoon> Hey @patstaresat I got back into FFXIV and I forgot how to play, so i picked up monk as my first class instead paladin. dear god what have I done.
[1:01:00] <+agarbagefox> you doing okay? @PatStaresAt
[1:01:07] <%Aleate> Its base kit as of the last patch
[1:01:08] <+pectusumbra> Pat hates getting stabbed with Syringes. He'd rather do it himself
[1:01:09] <$QueequegTheater> Just like Billy, Demo, and Bubba, nice
[1:01:12] <+GrampsGrubberfly> i thought that was an addon only thing
[1:01:12] <@SoFarFetched> There you go
[1:01:15] <ha2ken> This is a learning game...a'll good
[1:01:20] <$Quality_Debauchery> oh nice

[1:01:23] <thetrashman_sc> got em PogChamp
[1:01:23] <ManfredA> @ptmpopulatethemoon that's extra shitty cuz next patch MNK is getting reworked, possibly majorly
[1:01:27] <$Dakuu75> AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH~!!!
[1:01:35] <huskarl_zap> That Tom scream
[1:01:35] <%Anime_Flux> bonk
[1:01:38] <studleydoorite> his power looks like me looking for oreos at night
[1:01:47] <heartlesshealer> just how much can he juice?
[1:01:48] <ItamarZel> short killer
[1:01:49] <$Dakuu75> literally beating ppl with his pimp-cane
[1:01:50] <count_bob> Pat did you see Korone playing DBD?
[1:01:50] <%AnIcedCoffee> His power completely shuts down the upstairs loop on saloon
[1:01:52] <Mr_Strut> Seems like the sprint is more for utility than chasing
[1:01:55] <$QueequegTheater> LUL
[1:01:58] <heartlesshealer> oh no turn speed!
[1:02:00] <ShineTheDiamond> @studleydoorite Hahahaha same
[1:02:01] <ManfredA> it's for both
[1:02:06] <ManfredA> Pat just isn't super good at it
[1:02:10] <ptmpopulatethemoon> @manfreda Like for better? or worse?
[1:02:14] <%TheWinged7> how could this happen?
[1:02:19] <%damienlunas> Watching her facecamp Kappa
[1:02:28] <%TheWinged7> How can this be?
[1:02:29] <$QueequegTheater> @Mr_Strut If you really know the map you can dominate with it, but for most people that's more or less the case
[1:02:31] <ManfredA> @ptmpopulatethemoon for better but it'll prolly fuck with your muscle memory when they change it
[1:02:32] <restingbones> but... its in japanese
[1:02:35] <%miabyte> any hesitation = instant punishment
[1:02:41] <%Anime_Flux> foiled by wood
[1:02:42] <+lumbunny> @ptmpopulatethemoon For better, supposedly.
[1:02:44] <ManfredA> yeah Haddonfield sucks for killers
[1:02:54] <%YakumoYomi> But did you watch Choco Sensei, Towa-sama, and Pekora play it?
[1:02:56] <$QueequegTheater> High skill floor
[1:02:57] <%Aleate> Off of Rush the pallet break is way faster
[1:02:58] <heartlesshealer> high skill floor?
[1:03:00] <+SpareKeese> This looks like THE WORST map for blight
[1:03:02] <%barrakuta371> When we gonna get Pat Stares At Korone/Hololive?
[1:03:12] <$QueequegTheater> PH isn't slow
[1:03:13] <studleydoorite> you're a short skill floor streamer
[1:03:15] <%nmaten> do i hear johns?
[1:03:15] <$QueequegTheater> He's 115
[1:03:17] <%TheWinged7> And girls are watching
[1:03:22] <$QueequegTheater> Or 110, or whatever
[1:03:25] <ptmpopulatethemoon> @manfreda if I switched classes as soon as I could, will the road to 70 buff still work?
[1:03:28] <thetrashman_sc> bruh
[1:03:29] <huskarl_zap> why the pick axe
[1:03:32] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[1:03:37] <ManfredA> that looked like autoaim to me
[1:03:38] <$QueequegTheater> Getting bullied by Bill
[1:03:40] <@SoFarFetched> I think that's his c ane
[1:03:44] <Mr_Strut> Be ashamed
[1:03:44] <@SoFarFetched> a very sharp cane
[1:03:44] <%miabyte> you got dis
[1:03:44] <heartlesshealer> it's fine. A learning happen
[1:03:46] <fuji_92> bruh
[1:03:50] <jadefox33445> who is pat playing as?
[1:03:51] <ShichiNoBushi> So you're playing Pat as a Killer?
[1:03:53] <+SpareKeese> Omg
[1:03:54] <@SoFarFetched> The Blight
[1:03:55] <+dezimaly> grabbing Bills
[1:04:01] <ShineTheDiamond> You should be sorry
[1:04:02] <ha2ken> Warm up round
[1:04:03] <$QueequegTheater> @jadefox33445 ping pong enthusiast
[1:04:03] <ItamarZel> dude, blight is so smol
[1:04:07] <%WhereIsWill> the true cringe plays Kappa
[1:04:10] <%Broand> Is that bill from dead for left
[1:04:10] <huskarl_zap> Grabbin Bills
[1:04:11] <+VoytekBus> Be more sorry?
[1:04:12] <godzookylives> AArghhhhh
[1:04:12] <%MechArch> needs benny hill music in the background
[1:04:14] <ManfredA> also Blight has an extra short POV for no reason that doesn't match up with his model at all
[1:04:20] <+michingmallecho> I forgive you...naht
[1:04:21] <$QueequegTheater> @Broand ye
[1:04:22] <thetrashman_sc> yes its bill
[1:04:27] <ManfredA> Blight himself is much taller than a survivor
[1:04:31] <%Anime_Flux> nice
[1:04:33] <%juxtest> Nice
[1:04:33] <studleydoorite> bill from dead by leftight
[1:04:35] <thetrashman_sc> nice
[1:04:35] <$QueequegTheater> See, you did it
[1:04:40] <%patriotrenegade> pick her up by her ass
[1:04:42] <thetrashman_sc> good use of the power
[1:04:43] <+lumbunny> @ptmpopulatethemoon Road to 70 will still work.
[1:04:52] <restingbones> You can't run from him in a straight line yeah
[1:04:57] <%Profmcstevie> He seems good in a corridor chase situation
[1:05:02] <%Garthunox> Pat are you and paige excited for Little Hope?
[1:05:05] <%Anime_Flux> so many syringes
[1:05:10] <ha2ken> DBD Double Dash
[1:05:12] <ManfredA> Blight is great between tiles
[1:05:12] <$QueequegTheater> Yay, the bare minimum Kappa
[1:05:17] <ManfredA> he's very hard to evade
[1:05:22] <ptmpopulatethemoon> @lumbunny thanks bro
[1:05:29] <%rdark_ksu> when you bump into shit it seems like this dude is just a drunk
[1:05:30] <+SpareKeese> T H U M P
[1:05:32] <%WhereIsWill> gottem
[1:05:33] <%Aleate> psaDogchamp
[1:05:35] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt He's at literally double speed during the dash
[1:05:35] <thetrashman_sc> no ds PogChamp
[1:05:39] <zeif00> LUL
[1:05:49] <+SpareKeese> Ah
[1:05:51] <@SoFarFetched> Im gonna make a guess the Meg is new
[1:05:53] <Decarcassor> Blight os really easy to evade actually. Just make hard turns when he rushes at you.
[1:06:04] <+SpareKeese> Whose that?
[1:06:04] <%TheWinged7> why dont you use the kill power?
[1:06:06] <+dezimaly> needed the warmup
[1:06:07] <%Gogogolem> Cosole players.
[1:06:09] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt No, they could be much worse
[1:06:10] <%miabyte> they play at my level Kappa
[1:06:11] <ergulor> or console players
[1:06:11] <$QueequegTheater> Trust me
[1:06:12] <%Aleate> These lads are having a rough time
[1:06:12] <%maskofmichael> Everyone is just rusty
[1:06:13] <+Link232> Yeah Pat isn't at the high ranks so it isn't just DS/Dead Hard/Unbreakable every game
[1:06:23] <ManfredA> a good blight knows people will try to juke
[1:06:24] <%TheWinged7> he has an ability to kill people who are down doesnt he?
[1:06:24] <@SoFarFetched> @TheWinged7 dont think he brought a Mori
[1:06:25] <$QueequegTheater> @TheWinged7 Do you know what a mori is
[1:06:27] <bbHighvalor> pat is smurfing
[1:06:28] <thetrashman_sc> theres good console players smh
[1:06:29] <ManfredA> it's just counterplay at that point
[1:06:29] <mudamudajo> you mean memento mori?
[1:06:31] <huskarl_zap> Kill with power
[1:06:33] <+DonnieAdonis> I too am "bad" at this game
[1:06:43] <%Aleate> @link232 that must be nice tfuBlank
[1:06:45] <$QueequegTheater> I'm a good console player :(
[1:06:45] <%TheWinged7> ahh ok
[1:06:46] <studleydoorite> J on your keyboard kills people, most players don't know
[1:06:47] <@SoFarFetched> You can only kill if you bring a Mori to the match.
[1:06:52] <@SoFarFetched> Unless you're pyramid head
[1:06:57] <$Quality_Debauchery> press the kill button
[1:06:59] <$QueequegTheater> Or Michael
[1:07:00] <ManfredA> PH is the only one who can kill outright without an addon or mori
[1:07:00] <+VoytekBus> Kill with love
[1:07:04] <%nimu290> holy shit pat i feel bad for you because of what sega did to virtual fighter.
[1:07:05] <@SoFarFetched> oh yes and Michael
[1:07:06] <thetrashman_sc> kill the steve
[1:07:08] <Discount_CJ> is Pat playing with friends or random?
[1:07:10] <$QueequegTheater> @ManfredA Myers
[1:07:12] <@SoFarFetched> Randoms
[1:07:17] <+DonnieAdonis> Randoms
[1:07:19] <ManfredA> Michael needs an add on
[1:07:20] <thetrashman_sc> oh wait thats not a steve
[1:07:21] <namisrot> i know a dog called michael
[1:07:23] <$QueequegTheater> @ManfredA Myers can do it without hooking or injuring
[1:07:23] <+democrazyyy> ew 6 fingers
[1:07:24] <namisrot> he's a very nice dog
[1:07:25] <$FluffiTamamo> So does Pat hate Ol' Pinball too?
[1:07:26] <Decarcassor> PIg can also kill outright with her traps.
[1:07:30] <+democrazyyy> call inigo montoya
[1:07:40] <CoffeeKaiju> Thanks to whoever mentioned the l4d2 update. games 1.99 on steam rn finally rebought tonight
[1:07:43] <+SpareKeese> EEEWWWW he does have six fingers
[1:07:44] <$QueequegTheater> @ManfredA But that's still his own power, it's not an offering
[1:07:44] <Decarcassor> Myers need add-ons to kill.
[1:07:45] <%knivhands> NGL, the FOV looks like he's a little turtleman
[1:07:58] <zeif00> If you're having trouble gauging what you can bounce on there is an add on that displays that for you
[1:08:00] <%LouieRouie> Is this guy just an elderly midget on speed?
[1:08:03] <ManfredA> yeh but PH is the only one who has it in his base kit
[1:08:08] <anAngryHamster> I'd rather see Pamela Voorhees in here than Jason
[1:08:10] <count_bob> Yes
[1:08:14] <%Aleate> That was a pretty good Rush tbh
[1:08:20] <studleydoorite> the sixth finger gives him all his speed
[1:08:20] <$QueequegTheater> LUL
[1:08:23] <ManfredA> he's not even small
[1:08:23] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[1:08:24] <ManfredA> it's weird
[1:08:26] <Mr_Strut> So just future Pat?
[1:08:28] <@SoFarFetched> hey sometimes killers are that d umb LUL
[1:08:33] <ManfredA> his actual height is like a head taller than a survivor
[1:08:34] <+dezimaly> looks like Paige kind of
[1:08:37] <+SausageShogun> LUL
[1:08:37] <Decarcassor> @ManfredA Pig does too.
[1:08:38] <%maskofmichael> You killed the Paige, good job
[1:08:39] <%WhereIsWill> what even is this round LUL
[1:08:39] <thetrashman_sc> i should play more dbd
[1:08:41] <+SpareKeese> He HUNCHED
[1:08:42] <%Sora20030c> the sixth finger lets him put his pinky up while injecting drugs
[1:08:42] <$QueequegTheater> Myers needs an add-on but he's the only one who can kill without hooking even once
[1:08:43] <+VoytekBus> Pat sized
[1:08:45] <ManfredA> his eyes are in his nipples apparently
[1:08:46] <heartlesshealer> sometimes it works, you don't know
[1:08:47] <%Sora20030c> got to stay fancy
[1:08:48] <%miabyte> some of the collision for objects isn't the greatest
[1:08:52] <ManfredA> true
[1:08:58] <+DonnieAdonis> I have that same pineapple pattern on shorts
[1:09:00] <+pectusumbra> sometimes matchmaking works
[1:09:02] <+democrazyyy> imagine how powerful he would be if he had a seventh finger tomatoDread
[1:09:06] <+agarbagefox> I will say this map does suck kind of for him a bit.
[1:09:07] <thetrashman_sc> sometimes survivors deserve to be killed
[1:09:09] <ManfredA> Myers is also the best killer so it makes sense
[1:09:11] <Mr_Strut> Play to win
[1:09:16] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Aside from Silent Hill-based favoritism, who would you consider your main?
[1:09:17] <heartlesshealer> Pat lame confirmed
[1:09:26] <ha2ken> Play to win
[1:09:28] <thetrashman_sc> meyers is not the best killer LUL
[1:09:29] <+SpareKeese> BABY
[1:09:29] <+TsunamiPoro> pat u should play a char u like
[1:09:32] <mr_slaide> BABY ON THE LOOSE!
[1:09:37] <heartlesshealer> WHY WOULD YOU JUMP OUT
[1:09:39] <+SausageShogun> LUL
[1:09:40] <+GrampsGrubberfly> myers is super fun tho
[1:09:42] <+SpareKeese> ?
[1:09:44] <$QueequegTheater> Myers is B tier, his early game is super weak
[1:09:45] <@SoFarFetched> @QueequegTheater Think he really liked Hillbilly, but well with the nerf and all
[1:09:48] <ManfredA> not best like most powerful
[1:09:50] <+SpareKeese> Ehat just happened?
[1:09:50] <$Quality_Debauchery> bad timing dude
[1:09:50] <zeif00> LUL
[1:09:50] <+democrazyyy> purge the weak
[1:09:51] <LordOfThePoultry> big oof
[1:09:51] <thetrashman_sc> hes fun as hell
[1:09:51] <%dante_must_die_exe> how hard did the 3090 gets scalped today @PatStaresAt ?
[1:09:51] <ManfredA> best as in da best
[1:09:52] <ManfredA> pls
[1:09:53] <%Dementedpenguin> I had a match once where I got the final gen then had the killer chase me around the map TWICE.... and the other survivor just sat on the hatch the whole time...... NotLikeThis
[1:09:53] <californaya> there's a Blight add-on that shows you where people are when you bounce into things, that shit is BUSTED
[1:09:56] <+SpareKeese> *What
[1:09:56] <thetrashman_sc> i love him
[1:10:00] <@SoFarFetched> came out of the closet at a bad time
[1:10:01] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[1:10:03] <DeanX27> Worst timing for that guy
[1:10:03] <namisrot> the survivor noises are so funny
[1:10:05] <%WhereIsWill> easiest 4K ever
[1:10:06] <%miabyte> 4k outta what ever the hell that match was, gg
[1:10:06] <namisrot> HUEEHUEH
[1:10:11] <heartlesshealer> oh man
[1:10:14] <Decarcassor> Myers has a great design but he isn't very good in the current state of the game.
[1:10:14] <%codycurry52> hes so drunk
[1:10:15] <+TsunamiPoro> play pyramid head
[1:10:15] <+SpareKeese> Ooohhhh
[1:10:15] <@SoFarFetched> time to see their ranks
[1:10:19] <%AnIcedCoffee> that would have been an easy adept
[1:10:20] <ManfredA> everyone knows the best killer is Nurse
[1:10:23] <$QueequegTheater> @SoFarFetched The "nerf" isn't really much of one, you have to be abusing the shit out of the chainsaw to even have to worry about it
[1:10:25] <ManfredA> if you can play her
[1:10:27] <heartlesshealer> hmm
[1:10:31] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> War characters is that?
[1:10:31] <@SoFarFetched> Console players can't see after game chat
[1:10:34] <+SpareKeese> ?

[1:12:06] <heartlesshealer> Mechanics or stats?
[1:12:07] <ECRead> I like PH and Wraith doodbenny
[1:12:09] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt otz doesn't use that build anymore LUL

[1:12:15] <heartlesshealer> mechanics
[1:12:15] <zeif00> Yeah it doesn't do that thing anymore with the other perk
[1:12:15] <ManfredA> Otz is a good place to steal from
[1:12:18] <+SpareKeese> Oh boy
[1:12:18] <%miabyte> technically surveillance was bugged apparently
[1:12:21] <ECRead> it turns back to red yeah
[1:12:22] <DeanX27> And I was just thinking of getting Pig too
[1:12:25] <thetrashman_sc> its still good tho
[1:12:31] <reonome> LUL
[1:12:31] <%Aleate> I use STBFL otzBrain
[1:12:37] <acid_pit1> new blight perk will be great for a gen kick build
[1:12:42] <ManfredA> I love STBFL
[1:12:46] <%knivhands> Corruption helps so much
[1:12:52] <+dezimaly> WTF this is so many perks
[1:12:53] <+A_mere_shrubb> nurses call?
[1:12:54] <Mr_Strut> But what if your favorites were nerfed too
[1:12:54] <ShichiNoBushi> BBQ and Chilli
[1:12:55] <$QueequegTheater> @Aleate Save isn't great on PH since he's an M2 killer
[1:12:58] <@SoFarFetched> bottom left

[1:13:08] <ItamarZel> bottom left :(
[1:13:14] <+SpareKeese> Ooohh nooo
[1:13:17] <$QueequegTheater> @dezimaly 3 for each killer plus a bunch of default perks
[1:13:18] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah corrupt is good
[1:13:21] <thetrashman_sc> pyramid head isnt completely m2 tho
[1:13:22] <%Sora20030c> honestly, I prefer CI over Ruin
[1:13:22] <zeif00> I think otz runs a different build now with Undying out
[1:13:23] <ManfredA> yeah corrupt is great
[1:13:24] <ItamarZel> bork
[1:13:26] <%maskofmichael> BORK
[1:13:28] <DeanX27> When survivors don't have offerings, I get scared
[1:13:29] <@SoFarFetched> especially on killers that need set up
[1:13:32] <heartlesshealer> oooh
[1:13:35] <ECRead> haunted ground can be really fun with PH
[1:13:36] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt StBfL is god tier on Pig
[1:13:43] <%Sora20030c> trapper basically needs CI i swear
[1:13:45] <+FaunThePawn> Sniper Build
[1:13:47] <+SpareKeese> BARK
[1:13:50] <ManfredA> STBFL is just good on any M1 killer tbh
[1:13:55] <%edwardskacz> monitor?
[1:13:57] <ManfredA> especially Freddy imo
[1:13:57] <%AnIcedCoffee> Nurse's is still my favourite perk on PH but I swapped it out in the tryhard build
[1:14:00] <$QueequegTheater> Monitor and Abuse
[1:14:11] <+internetexplorer11> why is the loading so big
[1:14:20] <$QueequegTheater> Bringing an ebony
[1:14:21] <ManfredA> someone's net prolly
[1:14:26] <$QueequegTheater> That's the tryhard build
[1:14:26] <%knivhands> Loading is big because of the console players
[1:14:30] <+BigCoffee> Ice coffee how could you do this to us
[1:14:30] <%Dementedpenguin> Corn DanGame
[1:14:36] <%Dementedpenguin> * DansGame
[1:14:37] <@SoFarFetched> Well looks like someone has Decisive Strike LUL
[1:14:38] <+Chambers_Pot> Pyramid Head dies in Silent Hill 17
[1:14:39] <ManfredA> the big brain play is bringing a cypress and pretending it's an ebony
[1:14:42] <%knivhands> Takes a bit longer for them to load in
[1:14:46] <$QueequegTheater> But he's not slow
[1:14:46] <thetrashman_sc> hes not slow tho
[1:14:47] <zeif00> Tinkerer, Ruin, Undying, and DIscordance is the build Otz runs now on PH
[1:14:47] <%maskofmichael> @internetexplorer11 It has to add in the salt
[1:14:50] <thetrashman_sc> hes standard speed
[1:14:54] <Midnight188> I wanna play this game more but im big stupid and ppl juke me too easily.
[1:14:54] <%Dementedpenguin> Oh this map, nvm

[1:15:24] <+Chambers_Pot> Where be Triangle Girl?
[1:15:26] <ManfredA> avoid the barbed wire at all costs
[1:15:26] <ha2ken> My head canon wants to believe PH is just surfing around the map on his big sward
[1:15:31] <+Link232> I always liked how which survivor your choose literally doesn't matter, but stereotypes associated with the characters still persist
[1:15:33] <%juxtest> Take that locker
[1:15:53] <californaya> Pat, I would humbly request that you get better at aiming
[1:15:56] <Decarcassor> Feel the rust
[1:15:56] <AngryCaterpillar> gotta make sure you do the full 360 before your no-scope pyramid headouken
[1:16:10] <%miabyte> isn't being rusty kind of apt for PH?
[1:16:14] <$QueequegTheater> Use a controller coward
[1:16:16] <count_bob> Rusty...JUST LIKE PYRAMID HEAD!
[1:16:19] <Mr_Strut> Don't try, just be perfect, all the time
[1:16:23] <+michingmallecho> Rust in peace
[1:16:27] <thetrashman_sc> pat
[1:16:28] <ManfredA> yeah play controller Huntress
[1:16:29] <+thickshield> little wd40 and you will be back to punishing folk in no time
[1:16:31] <+Chambers_Pot> Pyramid Head can only judge people that are close enough, rob someone more than 10 feet away he could not care less

[1:26:34] <stardustcrusad3r> cat peed in the corner of my room by the AC it still smells a month later
[1:26:34] <mr_slaide> He will live in the bathroom... forever.
[1:26:37] <%barrakuta371> Thankfully, my cat has never peed outside of the litter box save for when she was a kitten
[1:26:41] <viewtifulr> pissy runs kitty
[1:26:42] <%weissguard> Why didn't Elmo simply assert dominance over the box by making it his new play place?
[1:26:45] <%AnIcedCoffee> but you have to prestige 3 him
[1:26:47] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> reward him
[1:26:52] <Mr_Strut> Leveling the character you never want to use seems like a waste

[1:27:09] <Decarcassor> Do it for the perks
[1:27:11] <OperatorJo_> cat piss is like concentrated ammonia
[1:27:17] <%miabyte> @Mr_Strut you can unlock their perks
[1:27:24] <zeif00> Oh yeah Pat: Tinkerer, Ruin, Undying, and Discordance is the build Otz runs now on PH
[1:27:28] <%maskofmichael> how long would you say it takes to get every killer to 50?
[1:27:28] <Mr_Strut> neat
[1:27:29] <+SpareKeese> Oooohhhhh
[1:27:34] <mr_slaide> YAY!
[1:27:36] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah you either level up to unlock their perks if you want it soon,or you wait until the store carries it so you can buy it. But it rotates weekly.
[1:27:42] <+pectusumbra> Okay, real question. Am I just stupid, how do you look at stream archives while stream is up?
[1:27:45] <%Psych_man13_13> Pat, what do you think about the new survivor perks?
[1:27:46] <thetrashman_sc> way too long
[1:27:48] <Mr_Strut> Depends on how good you are at the game
[1:27:51] <mr_slaide> A long time.

[1:27:55] <+justmildlilac> justmildlilac subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:27:57] <%king_wragles> @maskofmichael it took Otz Darva about 2 months I think
[1:28:10] <%miabyte> and pat doesn't play survivor so...
[1:28:14] <%AnIcedCoffee> On average it's about 1.5 million blood points to get a killer to 50
[1:28:17] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @pectusumbra go to past broadfasts
[1:28:17] <+Duece9BloodGang> So what happened?
[1:28:20] <@SoFarFetched> @pectusumbra click on Pat's Icon that says live and it should show the categories like "schedule,chat,video,etc"
[1:28:24] <%maskofmichael> @king_wragles well thats his job so...
[1:28:26] <AngryCaterpillar> By the time you get all the killers to 50 you're nowhere near maxing them out, because you've unlocked a shitload of perks that will take dozens of levels more to unlock
[1:28:30] <+Duece9BloodGang> Anybody?
[1:28:34] <Mr_Strut> wut
[1:28:38] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[1:28:42] <%Dementedpenguin> I've maxed out Trapper of all Killers. LUL I played him when the game came out, so i guess that makes sense.
[1:28:44] <Decarcassor> It takes about 1.5 million BP to take a character to 50 more or less.
[1:28:52] <%barrakuta371> Dennis system?
[1:29:05] <+Duece9BloodGang> Always sunny
[1:29:05] <RollCritFail> But what is the Implication of the D.E.N.N.I.S. System?
[1:29:17] <@SoFarFetched> @Duece9BloodGang Cat peed cause a box was in his favorite spot,so Pat had to brb in the middle of the game while he dealt with that. Came back to the match being finished LUL

[1:29:25] <freelancebabymaker> @PatStaresAt god ill never get over just how fucking good pyramid heads design in this game is dude
[1:29:30] <+Link232> It's still better to keep at 1 I think
[1:29:35] <@SoFarFetched> Not yet
[1:29:40] <zeif00> Tier 1 is still the best
[1:29:47] <+pectusumbra> @SoFarFetched thank you actually. Why do websites feel so compelled to change their shit like all the time
[1:29:51] <+Chambers_Pot> How many sides does a pyramid head killer have?
[1:30:01] <heartlesshealer> oh right the challenges
[1:30:02] <AngryCaterpillar> Killer gets matches like candy, survivors take weeks to get in
[1:30:02] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt They said they're gonna look at discordance eventually and agree it's weirdly designed

[1:30:16] <heartlesshealer> puppy? Chair squeal? What happen?
[1:30:17] <@SoFarFetched> Oh yeah they did it now so when you pick your killer and queue into a match,you cant change killers.
[1:30:19] <G03933> instant match times for killer? what is this witch craft?
[1:30:22] <+Duece9BloodGang> @sofarfetched I was 100 percent sure the dog was involved. Ty

[1:31:28] <heartlesshealer> might be a lot to avoid the PC mouse aimers
[1:31:29] <%Anime_Flux> There are a ton of console players
[1:31:29] <DeanX27> I'm on PS4 and am getting mostly people from other platforms now

[1:42:52] <$RealThiele> NEGATIVE BIT
[1:42:52] <%miabyte> And I thought my jokes were bad
[1:42:54] <ha2ken> He could be neutral too or basic
[1:42:56] <%CrookedSpiral> VoteNay
[1:42:57] <%jjolion> psaDown psaDown psaDown
[1:42:57] <Srthunda> that joke made me blind
[1:42:58] <%miabyte> I mean they are but
[1:42:59] <SlangForCigarettes> hoo boy
[1:42:59] <%TheWinged7> huh, whatd i miss i had a meeting call
[1:42:59] <+Brainworm205> Go to hell
[1:43:00] <@SoFarFetched> Console players apparently use Self Heal A LOT
[1:43:02] <%king_wragles> Tinkerer is pretty alright too, Pat
[1:43:04] <%Psych_man13_13> That joke made me toxic
[1:43:06] <causewaybob> Next bit
[1:43:07] <dapperskeleton69> what does all ears do?
[1:43:08] <%TheSavageGrunts> ha
[1:43:10] <$Quality_Debauchery> ah man i missed the bad joke
[1:43:19] <alapazam> its super not
[1:43:20] <$QueequegTheater> Self heal is awful
[1:43:20] <ECRead> it's the only reason I got GhostFace
[1:43:22] <hydroarsonist69> yes im burning my superbunnyhop brand George Socks for that joke
[1:43:24] <$QueequegTheater> What are you on
[1:43:26] <+SpareKeese> Oh wow
[1:43:32] <$QueequegTheater> It takes way too long
[1:43:35] <heartlesshealer> Oh is he starting to mix growling now too? Tantrum mode?
[1:43:36] <AngryCaterpillar> Takes seventeen years to self care
[1:43:38] <alapazam> Straight trash
[1:43:39] <@SoFarFetched> Self Heal is slower than First Aid
[1:43:40] <zeif00> When they fast vault over windows and pallets yeah
[1:43:41] <dapperskeleton69> self heal is op with perjs
[1:43:42] <%AnIcedCoffee> It's a waste of time
[1:43:44] <$QueequegTheater> It's double the time
[1:43:49] <%Dementedpenguin> self heal wastes a lot of time. you're better off letting someone else heal you
[1:43:51] <ZeeJiggle> Ye it's like 40 sceonds of just standing there.
[1:43:58] <heartlesshealer> sorry about toddler phase
[1:43:59] <@SoFarFetched> Plus Console players tend to coward it out alot LUL
[1:44:01] <AngryCaterpillar> By the time you finish self care a new generation can vote
[1:44:03] <Meekest> Self-Care is good IF you center your whole build around it
[1:44:03] <+SpareKeese> And soon he may throw YOU
[1:44:04] <%ArcanumArcanum> self-heal is strong if you're playing solo. Inner Strength is better for self healing, but self-heal isn't bad either
[1:44:05] <ZeeJiggle> It's not the worst in the game but it encourages bad habits.
[1:44:06] <$RealThiele> taunt to build meter
[1:44:06] <%miabyte> *finishes self heal* It's been 84 years...
[1:44:09] <+Iceman2343> nurses calling out an end to self heal lol
[1:44:09] <tkzhyon> Console players in red rank don’t use self care that much tbh
[1:44:13] <heartlesshealer> NO
[1:44:23] <OperatorJo_> YES
[1:44:23] <%coreyyotto> then he can't smell himself
[1:44:24] <+gamerform> he'd probably freak out more
[1:44:24] <%walternatorz> elmo would cease to be
[1:44:25] <%LouieRouie> is poison
[1:44:27] <%Birdigalore> Elmo might try to peel off his own skin
[1:44:28] <%coreyyotto> might go crazy
[1:44:30] <OperatorJo_> don't do that
[1:44:33] <$QueequegTheater> I find PC players are way more likely to DC than fellow console players
[1:44:34] <ZeeJiggle> I'd just bring a medkit with 2 full heals with instead
[1:44:34] <%ChestMimik> Cats still need to think they smell like Cat or they panic
[1:44:35] <+GrampsGrubberfly> whats wrong with the cat?
[1:44:35] <Ell1ot> when is Elmo's haircut?
[1:44:40] <$RealThiele> big succ
[1:44:41] <%AnIcedCoffee> @PatStaresAt It USED to be the best survivor perk in the game, look up self-care loop videos if you ever want to laugh
[1:44:45] <ShichiNoBushi> Then cat ceases to be.
[1:44:46] <%king_wragles> I mean, self heal isn't that bad if you're running solidarity with it
[1:44:48] <heartlesshealer> Oh! Also research what you use to give the pets Flea Baths with! Faulty deadly product going around!
[1:44:50] <AngryCaterpillar> Self care is only for when you're guaranteed to be playing with potatoes, you don't feel like bringing a health kit, and you're a maximum coward looking to play hatch games
[1:45:00] <tkzhyon> @queequegtheater idk man console players close app a bit lol
[1:45:00] <zeif00> Paige is trying her best
[1:45:01] <%king_wragles> But I'd rather just pick a medkit and 2 add ons to burn
[1:45:02] <+It_sjustjoey> Paige havin' a time
[1:45:07] <Mr_Strut> Even Pat
[1:45:09] <ZeeJiggle> Everyone is yelly
[1:45:11] <Mr_Strut> Especially Pat
[1:45:12] <%linSP> lisa whyyy
[1:45:13] <$QueequegTheater> Because they know how to pronounce armoire and they're annoyed at Paige's mangling of the english language
[1:45:14] <$FluffiTamamo> Paige left the house? Is she ok to do that?
[1:45:16] <+Quinn_Carter> Did Skelmo betray Paige?
[1:45:22] <ha2ken> Everything is lies activate
[1:45:33] <$QueequegTheater> MEG
[1:45:36] <%DedlokPM> @Quinn_Carter especially skelmo
[1:45:50] <dapperskeleton69> is zangief a talkative dog? or does he only bark when he wants stuff?
[1:45:52] <Huntercd> Shave the Elmo
[1:45:54] <@SoFarFetched> This is such a big map
[1:46:03] <Mr_Strut> He sneakin

[1:46:07] <hydroarsonist69> yes shave elmo
[1:46:12] <nutimik> lmao bill just strolling around
[1:46:16] <heartlesshealer> Dunno if our gingers or Chat know, but try to avoid "Hartz Flea and Tick Shampoo" for your pets for now. Risk of life for pets
[1:46:38] <dapperskeleton69> how come @heartlesshealer
[1:46:43] <$QueequegTheater> Bill is having a giggle
[1:46:48] <@SoFarFetched> I think that B ill doesn't know how to hide
[1:46:54] <@SoFarFetched> Or he's being a distractor
[1:46:55] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[1:46:57] <ha2ken> Good trade
[1:47:01] <AngryCaterpillar> Oh he got robbed

[1:47:21] <%mike2hands> DID HE TAUNT YOU
[1:47:23] <%ArcanumArcanum> so he invulned a bit but then got caught
[1:47:26] <dapperskeleton69> all the bills comin out now that left 4 dead is getting relevant again
[1:47:42] <@SoFarFetched> Bills be always around in DbD,they just always die really early in game Kappa
[1:47:44] <%ArcanumArcanum> wow pat is a filthy tunneler
[1:47:45] <heartlesshealer> @dapperskeleton69 "flea and tick shampoos like these contain a type of pesticide called pyrethrins or the synthetic versions known as pyrethroids. These are basically the same chemicals you’d find in cans of Raid."

[1:52:56] <$RealThiele> STONKS
[1:53:00] <$FluffiTamamo> Be nice Pat, xXxTruSuviva cant hear your terror radius over his kids crying in the back.
[1:53:04] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Pat doesn't doing that drive away potential new players though
[1:53:10] <nutimik> did they get a single gen?
[1:53:14] <%Anime_Flux> oopsie
[1:53:21] <%Dementedpenguin> Now she will know not to run down the basement in chases.
[1:53:24] <%Dementedpenguin> Learning
[1:53:31] <@SoFarFetched> that timing
[1:53:31] <dapperskeleton69> @queequegtheater if they picked survivor they knew the hell they were in for
[1:53:34] <rekinom> Improvise, adapt, overcome. Or perish
[1:53:38] <OperatorJo_> he chose die
[1:53:39] <%king_wragles> If you aren't ready to compete in a pvp game, then don't play pvp games
[1:53:39] <$RealThiele> boomer wheeling up that ladder quick
[1:53:40] <%SharKinStereo> "scare"? LUL this is a Horror game.
[1:53:40] <mr_slaide> It's their fault for being new.
[1:53:41] <%king_wragles> simple
[1:53:43] <nutimik> "fuck 'em" 3 months later the player base is down to 500
[1:53:45] <+SpareKeese> What character is that?
[1:53:45] <%Typhaeon> Remember to tip your Bill for all the work he did for you on palette
[1:53:49] <ECRead> ok THAT ppallet made me feel bad
[1:53:52] <%Profmcstevie> If getting dumped on cos you're bad pushes you away, you can't be a part of ANYTHING
[1:53:54] <$QueequegTheater> Then the game will die
[1:53:54] <+GrampsGrubberfly> that should be DbD's new slogan "git gud or die"
[1:54:00] <%Typhaeon> Pallet, fuck
[1:54:03] <%IDTheftVictim> The actual fix is to make decent matchmaking so new survivors get new killers
[1:54:08] <rekinom> It's not fun if the prey doesn't fight back - Pat 2020
[1:54:09] <+Quinn_Carter> But how can they do that if everyone starts out shit?
[1:54:10] <aeonicvector> But what if they are shit at being good, or good at being shit
[1:54:11] <%edwardskacz> It's not Pat's responsibility to compensate for bad matchmaking
[1:54:19] <%linSP> just be good from the start
[1:54:21] <dapperskeleton69> the wheel of progress will stomp new players into the dirt they belong in
[1:54:24] <$QueequegTheater> Because he's still on the hook
[1:54:26] <$RealThiele> yea matchmaking someone with 100s of hours with a newbie is oof
[1:54:28] <%Anime_Flux> LUL
[1:54:30] <$FluffiTamamo> Naw, garbage all day. Games not fun if I don't win. scottfWins

[1:56:32] <+firelink_dweller> Hey Pat, looking to get this game to play with friends but would need to eventually have all of the killers unlocked. Which version would you recommend to get for best value?
[1:56:38] <dapperskeleton69> gotta help old man bill get home
[1:56:38] <+Quinn_Carter> BUT PAT, THE POINTS
[1:56:53] <$Quality_Debauchery> gonna take you for a ride
[1:57:01] <$QueequegTheater> Pat please don't take him to the hatch just to close it
[1:57:02] <Ell1ot> is Pat going to close the hatch in front of Bill?
[1:57:04] <+JavaManJoJo> I once had a killer carry me around, find the hatch... then hook me and close the hatch for extra point :(
[1:57:06] <+animaturgy> Greenman has had a bunch of DBD sales for PC
[1:57:07] <+Puppet88> heard it
[1:57:14] <$RealThiele> the DElLL celeron Pro
[1:57:14] <$FluffiTamamo> Find the hatch, put him down, then slam it in his face when he gets near. nyannDere
[1:57:14] <%TheWinged7> sruggle already bill

[1:57:34] <rekinom> Why do people let bill escape? Is it a meme?
[1:57:36] <DianaTheAscian> bill did it
[1:57:36] <+RichAnvils> WILLIE WINS
[1:57:41] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Bill used his shadow clone jutsu to outsmart you
[1:57:45] <%patriotrenegade> GRABBIN BILLS

[1:57:47] <%rdark_ksu> billy boy wins!
[1:57:47] <+GrampsGrubberfly> should have final judgement him on the hatch LUL
[1:57:51] <$Dakuu75> does that count as being nice or BM?
[1:57:51] <DeanX27> Sometimes Killers will let the last survivor go
[1:57:52] <$RealThiele> bill will live on
[1:57:55] <DeanX27> Especially if they don't wiggle
[1:57:57] <+StooEsq> Bill lives this time

[1:58:16] <@SoFarFetched> @Dakuu75 being nice cause sometimes I'll have matches where the survivors are shit and I let the last player get hatch.
[1:58:17] <%AnIcedCoffee> I love him so much
[1:58:18] <huskarl_zap> kill the players, kill the game.
[1:58:19] <$QueequegTheater> @Dakuu75 Being nice. Giving hatch costs the killer almost 4,000 points
[1:58:20] <+dezimaly> remember when I said i'd kill you last
[1:58:21] <dapperskeleton69> Blighg looks super cool, but his kit sucks dick
[1:58:24] <+Limbomaster> What's wrong with the ping pong ball?
[1:58:25] <$RealThiele> give their face a light tap on the concrete
[1:58:28] <%Dementedpenguin> I showed sympathy once. The survivor returned the favor by destroying hooks LUL
[1:58:38] <@SoFarFetched> get them points
[1:58:43] <%AnIcedCoffee> Get the top hat for blight it makes him cuter and definitely stronger
[1:58:50] <+DescendantDroog> you still need to get him to 40
[1:58:51] <%DedlokPM> @firelink_dweller there is no "all the killers" edition so if there is a bundle that has a bunch of dlcs get that possibly on sale, then buy the others when they are on sale
[1:58:52] <+SpareKeese> Ooohh

Just gotta say that I'm super envious of the life and love that you guys share, it seems so incredibly fulfilling. I wish nothing but the best for you guys, keep living the dream.
[2:08:38] <BaronVonProlix> woolies had to jack up the price since he crashed the market
[2:08:49] <%patriotrenegade> Beige, when stream?
[2:08:52] <%Anime_Flux> aw unfortunate
[2:08:55] <$QueequegTheater> Big blunder
[2:08:56] <dapperskeleton69> ha, gotim
[2:08:59] <ha2ken> You at least gave her something to think about
[2:09:05] <chrishansen69_> Memes are are allowed to die with mgs2 tbh
[2:09:16] <%Anime_Flux> like a... 6th sense?
[2:09:20] <+SpareKeese> Really?
[2:09:28] <%AzureGale> It feels good to be evil
[2:09:32] <dapperskeleton69> pranked em
[2:09:33] <+SpareKeese> That's kinda cool.
[2:09:35] <%ChestMimik> It's the bortuogan
[2:09:36] <$RealThiele> makes sense there is only so many places to go
[2:09:37] <Mister_McDerp> FeelsGoodMan
[2:09:39] <%king_wragles> @chrishansen69_ but they're real things tho
[2:09:41] <%Ranryu692> that blood splatter looked like it said "KILL"
[2:09:45] <anAngryHamster> Hey Pat and Paige, what if they introduced a new mode where a hero character has to fight the killer and protect survivors?
[2:09:49] <+VoytekBus> a killers.....instinct

[2:10:08] <Mr_Strut> The bloodlust has overtaken him
[2:10:09] <DeanX27> Dead by Latte

[2:10:14] <+VoytekBus> :D
[2:10:15] <%king_wragles> @anAngryHamster then it'd be Friday the 13th and never get played
[2:10:19] <$QueequegTheater> Is there a better feeling than sitting on a downed survivor, counting to 20, hitting them off of UB, then counting to 60 and watching them DC once their DS wears off
[2:10:21] <ECRead> your psych major also probably helps a ittle
[2:10:23] <dapperskeleton69> TRYIN TO BE FANCY
[2:10:25] <%gespenst25> you are now playing manually.
[2:10:25] <+zeraux_> wait whars happening
[2:10:26] <chrishansen69_> king_wragles, not in the same way. Now they jesters.. They doomsayers back in the 20th century
[2:10:27] <@SoFarFetched> @SaltkeyAndAckfish not quite a hook but puts them in a containment on the other side of the map. It's good for countering perks that require hook saves.
[2:10:31] <lazerscraper> is that just dantes drive
[2:10:35] <+zeraux_> the stream stop
[2:10:37] <+zeraux_> ?
[2:10:39] <%AlphaTauri> worth a try

[2:10:55] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @SoFarFetched does it count as a hook?
[2:11:03] <chrishansen69_> So, now they things not taken seriously taking to a gallow
[2:11:10] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @SoFarFetched as in, does it count towards the hook kill?
[2:11:10] <eddie_hedgehog> when did they add ghostface?
[2:11:19] <DeanX27> c-c-c-combo
[2:11:20] <+Rofiarf> also the friday the 12th got litigated to hell didn't it?
[2:11:21] <hydroarsonist69> isn't friday the 13th in a licensing hellscape or something?
[2:11:22] <zeif00> WHOA
[2:11:25] <dapperskeleton69> this game didnt just eat F13's lunch, it stole the cookie and soda too
[2:11:26] <%king_wragles> 13th would be doing really well if it was the only one in it's specific niche
[2:11:27] <+GrampsGrubberfly> ghostface has been in for some time
[2:11:27] <$QueequegTheater> @eddie_hedgehog Like a year ago
[2:11:28] <+maybefalco> synchronized failure, the best type of failure

[2:18:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> @chrishansen69_ snake, this is just like my Japanese animes
[2:18:58] <%ryome> He also stares at me when he does it
[2:19:01] <HitchhikingThrough> Pat is a paragon of virtue and has never teabagged ever
[2:19:02] <Prons> Tea bagging? But that's illegal....
[2:19:21] <DeanX27> Good thing survivors are criminals
[2:19:22] <%BoxNavy> no
[2:19:29] <+gamerform> pat just R1
[2:19:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> Octacon is the hero of the series! He kills Huey!
[2:19:30] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt A lot of players are legitimately too young/didn't play FPSes so they don't know teabagging at the end of a match is toxic
[2:19:37] <BaronVonProlix> the best toxicity is the SSS rank
[2:19:38] <+TheNewZealandStory> @Quinn_Carter spoilers
[2:19:49] <$QueequegTheater> Many players are LITERALLY YOUNGER THAN HALO
[2:19:50] <%Anime_Flux> oh they know
[2:19:50] <+SpareKeese> Ooohhh, I just looked up who Huey is.
[2:19:55] <chrishansen69_> doc_ock_rokc, no its not.. There's no cigs.. and Id smuggle bullets
[2:19:56] <%BoxNavy> why else would they do it
[2:20:00] <%ChestMimik> Smash players teabag all the time, I think they know
[2:20:00] <$QueequegTheater> Not everyone
[2:20:03] <Srthunda> they super do
[2:20:07] <%ryome> teabagging is eternal
[2:20:11] <+Rofiarf> didn't someone claim teabagging was assualt once?
[2:20:11] <$Dakuu75> sometimes that's how you team up in a Battle Royal, ppl tea-bag to comunicate
[2:20:13] <%Profmcstevie> Teabagging isn't a matter of anything other than "stupid motion to mock others"
[2:20:16] <HitchhikingThrough> I think the act of teabagging itself makes it very clear what the intended message is
[2:20:17] <$QueequegTheater> Some people think it's like a tip of the hat
[2:20:19] <ha2ken> Giving new players too much benefit of the doubt
[2:20:20] <+Quinn_Carter> @TheNewZealandStory For what? MGS2 is a 19 year old game
[2:20:23] <+gamerform> there are adults born in 2002 right now
[2:20:23] <%Agami23> why dont you damage the generators?
[2:20:26] <+SpareKeese> It's kinda obvious what teabagging is tho
[2:20:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @QueequegTheater Teabagging is a contextual universal form of of communication.
[2:20:34] <Ipsenscastle> I don't know why anyone would feel the need to jump in and defend teabaggers
[2:20:34] <%Anime_Flux> I mean, you can point/wave
[2:20:36] <+TheNewZealandStory> @gamerform its a spoiler for mgs2
[2:20:39] <%Anime_Flux> but those aren't hurtful
[2:20:41] <+Jerkweed> flashlight clicking
[2:20:44] <valamia> I made friends with a killer once by poking them.
[2:20:47] <%juxtest> You could wiggle
[2:20:52] <%chiazam> I'm gonna teach my kids its a sign of respect
[2:20:53] <BaronVonProlix> whats more infurating? t-bagging or intense nodding?
[2:20:56] <+Quinn_Carter> @TheNewZealandStory MGS2 IS 19 YEARS OLD
[2:20:56] <$QueequegTheater> I'm not defending them, just trying to make Pat feel old
[2:20:58] <OperatorJo_> but halo 's kneeling was so fast and baggy
[2:21:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Just like honking ones horns you can have good tea bagging and bad tea bagging
[2:21:06] <%Anime_Flux> nice
[2:21:16] <+TheNewZealandStory> @Quinn_Carter yeah but you still spoiled it
[2:21:18] <DeanX27> Hitting those drives with PH is so satisfying
[2:21:18] <ToneBacas> if people keep teabagging in games, we might eventually come to a teabagging-based language
[2:21:24] <+callowbrodie> Aaymetrical rogue liike? barbTorch barbLUL barbAxe
[2:21:24] <%ChestMimik> It's easy to make someone who can remember when PCs didn't come with internet feel old tho
[2:21:25] <Ipsenscastle> @QueequegTheater a noble pursuit
[2:21:26] <hydroarsonist69> t bag but with accurate ball physics
[2:21:28] <Prons> I don't get bothered by teabagging or nodding really.
[2:21:32] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt If you didn't have PH, who would be your main
[2:21:36] <+Rofiarf> teabag based morse code
[2:21:37] <%bendatron> man pyramid head makes me want a good sh2 and 3 remaster
[2:21:42] <ECRead> yo wtf my phone committed sedoku at 8%
[2:21:49] <eddie_hedgehog> does ph mean pornhub or?
[2:21:53] <$QueequegTheater> Billy isn't ruined
[2:21:54] <BaronVonProlix> i like to say it doesnt bother me but thats a huge lie
[2:21:54] <conwaybearkiller> what killer is this?
[2:22:00] <%ChestMimik> Pyramid Head
[2:22:01] <$QueequegTheater> He's a little bit worse but not much
[2:22:05] <+gamerform> Deathslinger is tight as hell
[2:22:05] <+SpareKeese> @ECRead Rip
[2:22:05] <%maskofmichael> You like them cowboys?
[2:22:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> LEGION LEGION REPRESENT
[2:22:07] <$QueequegTheater> @conwaybearkiller Pyramid Head
[2:22:08] <+YabbaTroll> D: poor minh
[2:22:09] <%rdark_ksu> deathslinger is cool
[2:22:10] <Prons> They hurt Billy so much that he cries when he runs now atpFeelsBeardMan
[2:22:10] <+Soliloquy123> Billy's still amazing
[2:22:11] <conwaybearkiller> thanks
[2:22:11] <$RealThiele> every konami property, have zero hopes for it
[2:22:13] <%Anime_Flux> wow that tracking
[2:22:13] <hydroarsonist69> play huntress
[2:22:14] <@SoFarFetched> I like deathslinger
[2:22:15] <Midnight188> how do you consistently get grapples with deathslinger he looks cool but hard to use
[2:22:20] <+Quinn_Carter> @TheNewZealandStory Huey's death is mentioned in a codec call in the middle of the game, it's not even the focus of the story.
[2:22:22] <chrishansen69_> This is no Pat, he a jojo
[2:22:36] <%BoxNavy> ? what are they doin
[2:22:38] <$QueequegTheater> KILL THE NEA
[2:22:39] <+Quinn_Carter> @TheNewZealandStory Do you even know what MGS2 is about?
[2:22:41] <$QueequegTheater> KILL HER
[2:22:43] <@SoFarFetched> @Midnight188 usually gotta figure where they're gonna zig or zag next and aim a bit ahead sometimes.
[2:22:48] <+TheNewZealandStory> @Quinn_Carter sorry man, a spoiler is a spoiler
[2:22:51] <+metalwolfchaos> does this guy really not know his own name
[2:23:00] <$QueequegTheater> All Nea's Are Bastards
[2:23:07] <DeanX27> Neas are only evil when they have pink hair
[2:23:09] <chrishansen69_> MAn, those dios are running wild
[2:23:10] <DeanX27> 99% of the time
[2:23:12] <+riscuit> I cant see the bottom left has anyone died yet?
[2:23:17] <+Quinn_Carter> @TheNewZealandStory That's your problem not mine, it's a 19 year old game.
[2:23:18] <%Anime_Flux> Hiya! Take that!
[2:23:23] <BaronVonProlix> Pat what are you gunna do when the survivors realize they no longer seek a desire to be punished?
[2:23:43] <DianaTheAscian> LUL
[2:23:45] <Midnight188> @SoFarFetched I got okay at map awareness with Doctor and just abused that to get kills.
[2:23:49] <chrishansen69_> Play time pat.. play time..
[2:23:49] <+TheNewZealandStory> @Quinn_Carter it's always someone else's problem when you choose to spoil something
[2:23:54] <%maskofmichael> Get that Jane Booty
[2:23:55] <$QueequegTheater> @BaronVonProlix This is movie PH, he gives no fucks
[2:23:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BaronVonProlix style on survivor bots
[2:24:01] <$RealThiele> 19 years is beyond statute of limitations for spoilers my dude
[2:24:03] <%BoxNavy> die moon2DEV
[2:24:03] <%ChestMimik> F
[2:24:06] <%Anime_Flux> oof
[2:24:09] <DianaTheAscian> wow
[2:24:12] <Mr_Strut> Well then
[2:24:15] <+GrampsGrubberfly> man self care is a great killer perk
[2:24:15] <%BoxNavy> do these guys suck or is pat just good
[2:24:19] <ZeeJiggle> What a lunatic, self caring right there.
[2:24:21] <DianaTheAscian> that was a really bad play
[2:24:23] <%BoxNavy> cus these guys seem bad
[2:24:26] <BaronVonProlix> oh no the WORST PH
[2:24:27] <+Quinn_Carter> Here's a spoiler, the Titanic sinks
[2:24:32] <@SoFarFetched> @Midnight188 yeah sometimes you get weird survivors that keep sticking around for the doctor's shocks so you end up like getting stacks
[2:24:40] <%BoxNavy> nice B)
[2:24:40] <%ryome> Pat's currently in bad match making
[2:24:45] <+Rofiarf> pat be smurfing
[2:24:47] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah they're all console,console tends to either be REALLY good or really bad.
[2:24:50] <$QueequegTheater> "Lower ranks" Pat you're still green rank
[2:24:52] <%Anime_Flux> OOH
[2:24:54] <chrishansen69_> Dont be a non dio.. you the greatest thing ever
[2:24:57] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> LUL
[2:24:58] <%Anime_Flux> sucks for him
[2:24:59] <@SoFarFetched> Console players get ballsy on their self caring.
[2:25:00] <DeanX27> mind games
[2:25:06] <+GrampsGrubberfly> green ranks are lower ranks
[2:25:06] <Mr_Strut> So basically Pat can only stream this every 6 months
[2:25:08] <baked_potato11> you should've been at dbd when mmr was introduced, absolute shitshow
[2:25:19] <%chiazam> This is why we need SBMM kids
[2:25:32] <Sunstalker> It's like beating up kids. Easy and a victimless crime kinamaAyaya
[2:25:37] <+Quinn_Carter> Can't believe I'm getting called out in a Twitch chat for spoiling how Huey dies in MGS
[2:25:40] <Mr_Strut> No this is why we need local servers
[2:25:41] <Ipsenscastle> you're doing a poggers job, Pat
[2:25:44] <BaronVonProlix> also perfectly legal
[2:25:44] <ShineTheDiamond> LUL
[2:25:45] <$QueequegTheater> They tried, but they didn't have enough data so it was a shitshow
[2:25:49] <%Monkeyweed21> Is Pat gonna start complaining about SBMM cuz he doesn't wanna deal with a bunch of "sweaty tryhards" on stream?
[2:25:50] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah this game has trouble with SBMM,where the developers said "ranking doesnt matter in this"
[2:25:56] <+gamerform> @Quinn_Carter it's fine, nobody else is even concerned
[2:25:58] <%Anime_Flux> the hell was her plan?
[2:25:58] <%maskofmichael> It needs an offline training mode
[2:26:00] <Azathotic> "We need SBMM in Dead by Daylight" LUL LUL LUL
[2:26:01] <Midnight188> @SoFarFetched I either get parties with 0 coordination who all die or mostly die or a 4stack on discord who ghost you the entire match.
[2:26:02] <$QueequegTheater> Nea first
[2:26:02] <DianaTheAscian> wow
[2:26:04] <ShineTheDiamond> HUEY DIES IN MGS?!
[2:26:06] <$RealThiele> MMR would kill this game the install base cant handle it id imagine from just sheer numbers
[2:26:09] <%Fidranth> Fidranth subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! hey hey, it's the big 1-5. thanks for the streams.
[2:26:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> Fucking megs
[2:26:17] <anAngryHamster> Super Bmash Mrothers Melee
[2:26:20] <+GrampsGrubberfly> as a meg main im offended
[2:26:21] <@SoFarFetched> @RealThiele this game has hidden MMR
[2:26:27] <DeanX27> I hate Neas more than Megs
[2:26:28] <%maskofmichael> But your girlfriend is a Meg
[2:26:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt What about sabatoge Davids
[2:26:30] <daisymaisy02> what's wrong with kate?
[2:26:31] <+metalwolfchaos> Have you guys ever heard of a dwarf that makes Mjolnir with his bro?
[2:26:35] <BaronVonProlix> smell the hatch
[2:26:37] <%ChestMimik> Why do people keep saying this game is on the brink of dying
[2:26:37] <%Aleate> Cheryl main 4 lyf!
[2:26:38] <$RealThiele> oh jeez
[2:26:39] <+riscuit> mmr shouldnt be hidden tbh
[2:26:39] <$QueequegTheater> Megs are easily startled, but they'll be back soon, and in greater numbers
[2:26:52] <$RealThiele> whatever mmr they have hidden then is big garbo
[2:26:54] <%chiazam> Just like Paige, Pat also has a distaste for the wahmen
[2:26:58] <%BoxNavy> ???
[2:27:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> Claudets are annoying
[2:27:16] <%chiazam> No no no, you hide, I seek
[2:27:18] <%BoxNavy> let him win
[2:27:24] <ha2ken> Imagine running into a killer and just getting yoinked
[2:27:24] <@SoFarFetched> problem is we will never know their rankings since pat skips it LUL cause some high ranks play like potatoes
[2:27:32] <alliudmla> is pat playing alone or with paige/friends?
[2:27:32] <chrishansen69_> Monkeyweed21, dang it.. but sometimes gods could learn to listen to mortals.. Like anywhere a detached figure popped up in history and failed
[2:27:41] <BaronVonProlix> oh no!
[2:27:41] <Azathotic> @ChestMimik Because they dont like the game and are salty bitches. Game is fine
[2:27:44] <+Rofiarf> kill him
[2:27:45] <Mr_Strut> Don't bully the survivors
[2:27:45] <ergulor> was that the hatch a few second ago?

[2:37:12] <@SoFarFetched> @jellssssss20 the key,when meeting certain conditions can open the hatch for 30 seconds so all the survivors can escape in it.

[2:37:21] <+metalwolfchaos> khi

[2:37:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @jellssssss20 Keys are items Survivors use that alow them to escape early
[2:37:27] <Srthunda> they really think they invisible do they?

[2:37:50] <Mr_Strut> How much do they need for the spirit bomb?
[2:37:54] <%BoxNavy> that shit is so good
[2:37:56] <+GrampsGrubberfly> change keys so only one person can escape early
[2:38:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @jellssssss20 Keys are universally loathed so using one is basically enabling hard mode
[2:38:14] <huskarl_zap> ahh yes the cheating part
[2:38:16] <+SpareKeese> It's awesome
[2:38:19] <BlueLunecy> Is it better to feed people to the spider god, or to kill them yourself?
[2:38:25] <+zeraux_> 360 NO SCOPE
[2:38:37] <$RealThiele> keys sound like a badly designed item tbh
[2:38:38] <%chiazam> Yeah, but for the other guy that gets wallhacked
[2:38:38] <%mike2hands> PAT THE BULLY
[2:38:40] <tetriata> Nothing is more satisfying than 500iq trapper traps

[2:38:44] <$QueequegTheater> @BlueLunecy PH can do that but only on final hook
[2:38:48] <%chiazam> oh no the basement
[2:38:53] <jellssssss20> Did you see the new League character with a straight up DMC style meter
[2:38:56] <+metalwolfchaos> who else been in the matrix for 20 years
[2:38:58] <BlueLunecy> Ahh
[2:39:03] <@SoFarFetched> Mori's give more blood points. But you can only do Mori's when you hook them at least once.
[2:39:08] <%BoxNavy> moon2GUMS
[2:39:10] <+metalwolfchaos> not me and this guy FrankerZ
[2:39:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> PH is about having a shortcut that is meh to use
[2:39:23] <%Dementedpenguin> Moris used to be absurd. You originally could use one after downing a survivor ONCE. LUL
[2:39:27] <+sp_abadidea> does the Spider God not like it if PH chops every single survivor?
[2:39:27] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Myers is the only one who can do it on uninjured unhooked survivors, because he's the OG slasher
[2:39:33] <Mr_Strut> ok
[2:39:33] <johndoe0920> is PH considered OP?
[2:39:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> Wait... why did she put down the medkit!
[2:39:34] <zeif00> ggs
[2:39:36] <BlueLunecy> Something satisfying about fucking em up with the sword
[2:39:39] <bezzy_benz> it's better to kill them yourself as PH though cause it takes way less time
[2:39:49] <Mr_Strut> bully
[2:39:52] <@SoFarFetched> @doc_ock_rokc peace offering

[2:41:11] <$RealThiele> killer tosses victim into escape hatch
[2:41:14] <+riscuit> from her perspective that must have looked so toxic
[2:41:16] <+metalwolfchaos> he said the thing
[2:41:33] <Cheekynandos689> hey pat have you ever used cage of attonement and it actually helped you
[2:41:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> I remember one time I got a person near the hatch then picked them up again hooked them and closed it in front of them

[2:52:07] <@SoFarFetched> @Fidranth you can avoid BBQ & Chili triggering for you,can avoid doctor's area shock. Couple of survivor perks have a positive effect for hiding in locker.

[2:53:32] <Aydarkzero> accurate
[2:53:37] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Repeat after me: JUST. LEAVE.
[2:53:40] <Robot_Nixon_> distStudy
[2:53:41] <MasterCosmic> There gonna be toxic
[2:53:42] <%ChestMimik> Skillshot X would have helped them AND survived
[2:53:43] <%AzureGale> Still brutal
[2:53:43] <@SoFarFetched> Im fine with dying to help LUL I just get disappointed if they waste it and all die.
[2:53:44] <%Agami23> thats not advice for dead by daylight only kids!
[2:53:47] <%AnIcedCoffee> So when are we getting the sick huntress gameplay, Pat?
[2:53:51] <%rdark_ksu> dead weight gets no help
[2:53:54] <%Dementedpenguin> I've been in games where an easy 3 man escape goes to a zero escape
[2:53:56] <OperatorJo_> Pat was the real winner here
[2:53:59] <+sekshun789> Nurse's calling has been letting me down lately because people will just give up on healing and go all gens so I've been really enjoying I'm All Ears to get those sick aura reads during chase
[2:54:13] <+GrampsGrubberfly> once you unlock it you should try the ruin+undying combo
[2:54:31] <%bassoontyphoon> who would you say is the objectively worst killer? Personally I feel like its the gunslinger
[2:54:47] <+Jerkweed> hex undying is green
[2:54:48] <+sekshun789> @GrampsGrubberfly The real big brain play is Ruin, Undying, AND Haunted Ground.
[2:54:53] <$QueequegTheater> @bassoontyphoon Not even close, it's Clown or Wraith
[2:55:01] <Cheekynandos689> gunslingers not even close to bottom
[2:55:05] <baked_potato11> try new tinkerer it's really good with hex:ruin
[2:55:06] <%justmildlilac> Undying
[2:55:10] <%bassoontyphoon> @QueequegTheater god i forgot about the wraith
[2:55:11] <%TheWiggly> @bassoontyphoon Trapper is also pretty bad iirc
[2:55:13] <@SoFarFetched> YEah Deathslinger is like B Tier Killer.
[2:55:15] <%WhereIsWill> whens hatchet lady
[2:55:20] <+Das_Prints> Deathslinger is at least pretty fun to play.
[2:55:27] <+Jerkweed> aura lasts longer
[2:55:27] <%AnIcedCoffee> Better aura reading
[2:55:28] <Cheekynandos689> trapper is difficult not bad
[2:55:30] <+GrampsGrubberfly> they make the aura reading stronger
[2:55:30] <$QueequegTheater> More distance
[2:55:33] <UncannyMatt> just totem aura I think
[2:55:40] <+Link232> Aura revealed longer
[2:55:47] <@SoFarFetched> While Hex: Undying is active, Survivors within 2 metres of any Totem Totem}} have their Aura Aura}} revealed for 4/5/6 seconds
[2:55:48] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Undying+Ruin+Haunted Grounds
[2:55:49] <+Link232> Yeah you can run Hex/Undying/Haunting Grounds
[2:55:50] <+Jerkweed> use tinkerer with it completely broken
[2:55:55] <$QueequegTheater> Haunted Grounds can pop twice
[2:55:59] <+Link232> They can clense Undying, then cleanse Ruin
[2:56:01] <%AnIcedCoffee> Hex and undying is quite honestly stronger than old ruin
[2:56:05] <+Jerkweed> undying ruin tinkerer is op
[2:56:09] <+metalwolfchaos> brok knxBey
[2:56:11] <UncannyMatt> unless they clense undying first and then ruin
[2:56:11] <@SoFarFetched> Haunted ground causes everyone to be exposed LUL
[2:56:11] <+sekshun789> Haunted Grounds Undying is soooooo gross
[2:56:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> Fake trap hexes
[2:56:16] <UncannyMatt> or just all totems
[2:56:16] <+GrampsGrubberfly> they have to cleans the undying totem but have no way of knowing which one it is
[2:56:18] <bezzy_benz> you could replace nurses with it since it gives auras
[2:56:25] <ECRead> you MUST cleanse correctly twice with Ruin/Undying
[2:56:30] <+Jerkweed> yeah and tinkerer will go off multiple times
[2:56:32] <@SoFarFetched> pretty much yeah
[2:56:32] <+Link232> Clenase undying, then ruin
[2:56:40] <$QueequegTheater> Undying is an active totem
[2:56:53] <$QueequegTheater> So they have to cleanse every single active totem
[2:56:54] <%DedlokPM> they have to find undying or break all the totems to get rid of ruin
[2:56:58] <%AnIcedCoffee> Maps and detective's hunch are more common lately because of this combo
[2:56:58] <+sekshun789> Yea pretty much, and that's a huge waste of time totem hunting and not repairing gens
[2:56:59] <+TheEighthNobody> @PatStaresAt Undying/Haunted is incredibly strong
[2:57:02] <UncannyMatt> At least two if you get unlucky
[2:57:11] <+GrampsGrubberfly> this is why i run detectives hunch in this meta and cleanse every totem i see
[2:57:21] <$QueequegTheater> Haunted can proc up to 3 times
[2:57:23] <chrishansen69_> Somtimes.. it pays to be a janitor
[2:57:24] <nademonkey1100> so whatsthe lore for PH being here
[2:57:29] <+Jerkweed> you shouldve got rid of nurses calling for tinkerer or bbq
[2:57:30] <MasterTonberry23> that is so awesome this game still has an active playerbase, even though its getting on in years
[2:57:38] <%justmildlilac> Probably a portal
[2:57:42] <$QueequegTheater> YUP
[2:57:44] <$QueequegTheater> YEEEUP
[2:57:49] <+metalwolfchaos> knx1 knx2
[2:58:01] <@SoFarFetched> yup LUL
[2:58:01] <$QueequegTheater> YEEEEUUUP
[2:58:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> EEEYUP
[2:58:06] <%bassoontyphoon> NOW youre thinking with portals!
[2:58:07] <AngryCaterpillar> It's not as good as you'd think because you run out of totems to respawn on quickly
[2:58:11] <%AnIcedCoffee> Yeah but it also reduces the amount of totems that ruin can transfer to as well
[2:58:12] <+SpareKeese> Ooooohh
[2:58:12] <ECRead> Which is GREAT for PH
[2:58:13] <Cheekynandos689> damn
[2:58:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its EVIL
[2:58:22] <+GrampsGrubberfly> with ruin undying and haunted 4 of your totems is lit tho so you only get 1 respawn
[2:58:24] <+Soliloquy123> IIRC they made it so that Haunted Grounds does NOT respawn
[2:58:28] <%WhereIsWill> whats exposed?
[2:58:30] <+Das_Prints> Totem Russian roulette.
[2:58:31] <$QueequegTheater> It's okay, they're refusing to fix the bad totem locations
[2:58:36] <%Broand> What does judgement do?
[2:58:42] <AngryCaterpillar> PAT NO
[2:58:42] <@SoFarFetched> @WhereIsWill when you're exposed,the killer can down you in one hit instead of 2
[2:58:42] <$QueequegTheater> BLIND
[2:58:43] <UncannyMatt> exposed is instadown
[2:58:43] <+TCAmber> Pat i've been watching you and the guys for like 10 years hahaa I love catching up with you and Woolie on the podcast
[2:58:43] <%bassoontyphoon> behind youuu
[2:58:43] <jubejube56> LOL
[2:58:44] <chrishansen69_> I dont know man.. A janitor killer is an urban legend, could be an easter egg

[2:58:46] <faithless_zealot> blind

[2:59:15] <UncannyMatt> ????
[2:59:15] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You walked right past a survivor
[2:59:16] <%goose_attack_almanac> No you walked past some one earlier
[2:59:17] <Xelgus> not him dipshit

[2:59:22] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[2:59:22] <Mister_McDerp> not him, the other one
[2:59:23] <hideyoshi_k> So given PH drags his weapon behind him, is there any way to not make his first-person view look super awkward?
[2:59:24] <bustawof> Wrong guy
[2:59:24] <nademonkey1100> no you missed the other one
[2:59:28] <%Broand> Someone else was right beside the active generator
[2:59:28] <%bassoontyphoon> you had a nice stroll next to heather
[2:59:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> IN BRIGHT clothing
[2:59:33] <AngryCaterpillar> The unseen Nancy is the deadliest
[2:59:34] <ECRead> that one
[2:59:40] <%goose_attack_almanac> A guy crouched next to a shrub by the gen that popped earlier

[2:59:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Possibly
[2:59:49] <@SoFarFetched> Pyramid Head
[2:59:51] <chrishansen69_> Good kill!
[3:00:06] <ranarath> @justmildlilac Totem are objects that hex perks attach to. There are always five on the map. Totem that have a hex are lit with candles.
[3:00:08] <AngryCaterpillar> This poor man
[3:00:11] <%Anime_Flux> poor guy
[3:00:13] <%Dementedpenguin> @MasterMushin Silent Hill's Pyramid Head
[3:00:14] <UncannyMatt> poor guy
[3:00:15] <$QueequegTheater> This is why I run BT
[3:00:17] <$QueequegTheater> always
[3:00:18] <%WhereIsWill> bah gawd hes broken in half!
[3:00:22] <UncannyMatt> farmed LUL
[3:00:34] <hideyoshi_k> Hex Perks are generally stronger, but can be disabled by survivors
[3:00:35] <Djinnazz> blind
[3:00:45] <@SoFarFetched> Cause Otz told him to Kappa
[3:00:51] <UncannyMatt> YOU FOOL
[3:00:53] <%Dementedpenguin> LUL
[3:00:57] <Aydarkzero> oof
[3:00:57] <%WhereIsWill> LUL
[3:00:57] <chrishansen69_> Wow man, we hunting.. Never! ever empathize with prey!
[3:01:06] <Cheekynandos689> there was a new official Berserk model of Guts doing the edgy smile pose announced if anyone cares
[3:01:30] <%rdark_ksu> how far does the slash go?
[3:01:31] <Ninjalettuce> Did pat miss the person on the engine?
[3:01:32] <Aydarkzero> @Cheekynandos689 thats pretty cool
[3:01:33] <%BoxNavy> ??
[3:01:36] <+pyrojack6> jesus
[3:01:38] <$QueequegTheater> Is Otzdarva the RLM of DbD because Pat just passes on his opinions
[3:01:38] <@SoFarFetched> MEG GOT BODY BLOCKED BY THE QUENTIN
[3:01:40] <%WhereIsWill> good block bro Kappa
[3:01:44] <Ninjalettuce> Pog
[3:01:45] <chrishansen69_> Maggots can eat prey butt and we consider flies blessings
[3:01:49] <%BoxNavy> EleGiggle
[3:01:59] <%justmildlilac> @ranarath So, the perks you equip are AoE to the totem it's attached to? Or do the totems only exist to give survivors a chance to disable the perk?
[3:02:17] <$QueequegTheater> Quentin is asleep
[3:02:19] <@SoFarFetched> @justmildlilac certain perks are totems,others are passive or only activate when certain conditions are met.
[3:02:20] <%chiazam> AFK?
[3:02:20] <%goose_attack_almanac> He's struggling
[3:02:21] <AngryCaterpillar> They just exist to be disabled
[3:02:21] <+Jerkweed> its any totem
[3:02:22] <$QueequegTheater> Save him from Freddy
[3:02:23] <%WhereIsWill> how does pat get all these scrublords in his game? every DBD streamer i watch has ultra pro survivors LUL
[3:02:23] <UncannyMatt> is this guy afk?
[3:02:28] <+Jerkweed> any totem they get near their aura reveals
[3:02:31] <hideyoshi_k> They're map wide. The totem is just a disable chance
[3:02:33] <ECRead> that man's tryin to eat dinner
[3:02:45] <%bassoontyphoon> @Jerkweed thats disgusting
[3:02:51] <huskarl_zap> WHUFF
[3:02:57] <ranarath> @justmildlilac They only exist to give the survivor a chance to disable. Generally, hex perks are super strong which is why they can be disabled.
[3:03:00] <%justmildlilac> Gotcha, gotcha. Makes sense
[3:03:07] <%justmildlilac> Ah
[3:03:07] <@SoFarFetched> @WhereIsWill Im gonna assume it depends on his area,cause certain regions seem to have specific types of players.
[3:03:11] <$QueequegTheater> OOF
[3:03:15] <UncannyMatt> mindgamed em
[3:03:19] <%chiazam> GOTEEEEM
[3:03:20] <Djinnazz> Gottem!
[3:03:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> HARD READ
[3:03:21] <Cheekynandos689> GOTTEM
[3:03:24] <OperatorJo_> F
[3:03:30] <AngryCaterpillar> Wish I played in the potato region
[3:03:37] <%SirGO0SE> psaDab
[3:03:40] <Xelgus> playing this game against a killer way more skilled than you must be terrifying. they just always know where you are
[3:03:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ladies and gentlemen.... We got em
[3:03:47] <chrishansen69_> Jeff goldblum dinner.. I rate it 5 stars
[3:03:49] <$QueequegTheater> WHO'S CLICKING
[3:04:00] <+Das_Prints> I need to remember that flank for later. That was good.
[3:04:04] <AngryCaterpillar> Yeah but playing against survivors is way scarier, red rank survivors are big bullies
[3:04:05] <%WhereIsWill> sounds pretty likely @SoFarFetched cuz this is bonkers
[3:04:13] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I should probably unlock Ruin on Pig, shouldn't I
[3:04:16] <%chiazam> "Twitch streamers would body us live for entertainment" "Okay grandpa"
[3:04:24] <MasterTonberry23> im amazed theyre still able to keep coming up with perks for the survivors
[3:04:30] <@SoFarFetched> @WhereIsWill yeah cause almost everytime Im matched with killers/survivors. After Chat tends to always be talking about the region Im In.
[3:04:31] <+metalwolfchaos> bronkers
[3:04:45] <%Agami23> i think theres something wrong with that survivor. he seems kinda dumb
[3:04:49] <@SoFarFetched> like when I was talking with other survivors about the fire smoke
[3:04:49] <chrishansen69_> chiazam, okay bot from the future, stuck in the past
[3:05:28] <%TheWiggly> ruin good
[3:05:34] <$QueequegTheater> What was "old Ruin"
[3:05:37] <nademonkey1100> YES YOU DID SEE HIM
[3:05:38] <%WhereIsWill> good shirt is good
[3:05:41] <+pyrojack6> what a waste of agood shirt
[3:05:43] <$QueequegTheater> Dwight was in a locker the whole match
[3:05:47] <chrishansen69_> I rooted for you in terminator 2 chiazam
[3:06:08] <%ChestMimik> Shame
[3:06:10] <@SoFarFetched> yeah they got undying
[3:06:20] <ranarath> @QueequegTheater Old Ruin caused gens to regress whenever a survivor got a good skill check instead of a great one.
[3:06:30] <%bassoontyphoon> oof ouchie my eyes
[3:06:31] <%BoxNavy> that was a bad flashlight
[3:06:42] <$QueequegTheater> That's so much worse than new Ruin
[3:06:42] <@SoFarFetched> only time to flashlight is when the killer is in a forced animation
[3:06:47] <+Das_Prints> I think I heard they changed it but Ruin with Surveillance was always so fun. It would apply Surveillance to every regressing generator so you would always know if they started working on any of them.
[3:06:47] <%chiazam> Yikes
[3:06:47] <%BoxNavy> ah!
[3:06:52] <@SoFarFetched> like picking up survivor or pallet drop
[3:07:05] <Oxybe> Headphones are OP for the video game confirmed
[3:07:05] <%BoxNavy> wow get fucked
[3:07:06] <@SoFarFetched> yeah he gave up.
[3:07:06] <$QueequegTheater> GIVE HIM HATCH
[3:07:06] <%Anime_Flux> what the
[3:07:07] <Aydarkzero> wut
[3:07:08] <AngryCaterpillar> He was begging for mercy!
[3:07:10] <+pyrojack6> wut
[3:07:10] <%Captain_Joe1911> heart2Kkigomm heart2Jumjum
[3:07:13] <@SoFarFetched> He didnt Pat
[3:07:14] <$QueequegTheater> No he didn't
[3:07:16] <@SoFarFetched> That's a peace offering
[3:07:18] <%chiazam> Why'd he put it down?
[3:07:19] <$QueequegTheater> He is begging for his life
[3:07:20] <UncannyMatt> He offered you a medkit
[3:07:21] <+GrampsGrubberfly> he gave you his item in exchange for mercy
[3:07:24] <@SoFarFetched> Survivors give the item as a peace offering
[3:07:25] <%AncelDeLambert> Dwight is, uh, a little confused
[3:07:25] <hideyoshi_k> What do channel points do? I never watch live
[3:07:26] <%BoxNavy> jermaPluto toxic
[3:07:26] <@SoFarFetched> saying he gave up.,

[3:10:04] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt LOL no he will not
[3:10:08] <%chiazam> So the dog is just jumping on Elmo now?
[3:10:13] <$QueequegTheater> He'll be worse at turning
[3:10:17] <sydowoodo> slower but stronger
[3:10:19] <%bassoontyphoon> Who needs DEX anyways when he'll be BIG and STRONG
[3:10:23] <%SirGO0SE> he just need to move less to get further
[3:10:23] <$QueequegTheater> But he will still dash forward like Hillbilly
[3:10:27] <%ChestMimik> My parents Bulldog can do goddamned acrobatics when they want, they don't get slower
[3:10:29] <$dellakitty> @joylent_blue ah ok, thank you!

[3:10:57] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Bulldogs are like alligators, they can run quick in a single direction but are bad at turning
[3:11:02] <%ElkRiverDog> As somebody who has been downhill cannonball by a bulldog, no they will not get slower!￼
[3:11:14] <chrishansen69_> Dont care of his built.. that skin will be related to James

[3:12:09] <%ChestMimik> They basically start blanka balling into things
[3:12:13] <%SirGO0SE> toe tem

[3:12:46] <UncannyMatt> Damned if you do
[3:12:52] <%chiazam> OP
[3:12:58] <+CptDouglasJFalcon> now i think this build breaks kinda if they cleanse the one dull totem on the map
[3:13:02] <chrishansen69_> Silent hill 5 was toe tam
[3:13:02] <Bamcrash> I got a 63 & 1/3 chance of winning
[3:13:14] <zeif00> Detective's Hunch was always an underrated perk

[3:13:55] <@SoFarFetched> Pat needs junk food
[3:14:00] <blink289> is twitch fucking up for anybody else?
[3:14:03] <%Dementedpenguin> I have that promo saved to my computer. It's great.
[3:14:10] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Steiner Math should be taught at all levels of school AND business.
[3:14:10] <gruulmagebeast> you playin with any friends or just randos?
[3:14:18] <%bassoontyphoon> @blink289 it was on mobile but now im on my pc and its fine
[3:14:18] <@SoFarFetched> try and refresh,blink
[3:14:19] <+pyrojack6> more like the yspell RUIN amiright?
[3:14:29] <%nimu290> what 'r u buying?
[3:14:29] <ECRead> All 3 of those together aren't thaaaaat great since there's 5 totems and Haunted takes up 2 of those. So Haunted can eat up totems that could be for Ruin. still good though
[3:14:44] <mr_slaide> ELMO SCREMS!
[3:14:47] <chrishansen69_> Yeah, elmo not selling out.
[3:14:54] <$dellakitty> cat is screm
[3:14:58] <rufus2k2> so did Pat literally turn to dust trying to play 13 Sentinels or what?
[3:15:01] <%ChestMimik> God as my witness, his chance of winning drastically goes down
[3:15:11] <@SoFarFetched> also kitty old
[3:15:13] <blink289> I'm on PC and I've refreshed and have no clue
[3:15:14] <@SoFarFetched> and has old bones
[3:15:15] <%bassoontyphoon> how old is elmo??
[3:15:15] <sydowoodo> he chonky
[3:15:21] <blink289> its like skipping
[3:15:25] <%ChestMimik> Time to school them
[3:15:25] <+GrampsGrubberfly> i hate this map
[3:15:26] <Djinnazz> Old enough
[3:15:35] <+SpareKeese> Ooohhh ye ye ye
[3:15:43] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt That's what happens. They wake up at 6 and demand food, sleep for 12 hours, demand second food, run like maniacs for 15 minutes, then sleep another 11 hours
[3:15:54] <+Soliloquy123> Midwich is amazing aesthetically but kinda bunk for gameplay
[3:15:57] <+jt427> if only you had a 3080/3090
[3:15:58] <%bassoontyphoon> i love the design of this map but it sucks to play on tbh
[3:15:58] <hideyoshi_k> Hex: Pet Cat

[3:16:07] <%AnIcedCoffee> Pat playing with the Ultra settings handicap LUL
[3:16:08] <Midnight188> any ff14 players are Relic weapons worth the trouble of making them when I only just finished ARR?
[3:16:09] <+jt427> LUL
[3:16:11] <$QueequegTheater> Midwich is a fucking AWFUL map
[3:16:12] <$Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt Isn't your computer super-beefy, how do you have FPS problems at all?
[3:16:15] <chrishansen69_> I know, but he tries to carry more.. we a shitty pyramid head.. hunting down more capable prey, but not more deserving..
[3:16:15] <%bassoontyphoon> BLIND DEFEATED
[3:16:18] <+SausageShogun> LUL
[3:16:21] <%Anime_Flux> well done

[3:16:30] <+SausageShogun> PogChamp
[3:16:32] <Oxybe> We need Pat as survivor and Paige as killer mod. Pat's mind goblins fuck with the killers and Paige gets bonus chase speed and damage VS Vvymyn.
[3:16:40] <%ChestMimik> Hex: Throw Mankind Off Hell in a Cell
[3:16:54] <%nimu290> big reads

[3:17:08] <gruulmagebeast> good ol triangle man causing a ruckus
[3:17:08] <+SoriduSnaku> I loaded into this map as Oni and it was a truly horrible experience. this map is good for Freddy though

[3:17:20] <IronicGuardian> Haunted grounds and hex undying? TOXIC
[3:17:21] <%bassoontyphoon> drop it
[3:17:34] <hideyoshi_k> I'd rather get Midwich than Badham. Everyone is using map offerings this patch and I can't stand that map.
[3:17:41] <hideyoshi_k> It's like a worse Hadonfield
[3:17:42] <%ChestMimik> Hex: It was me, Austin
[3:17:49] <IronicGuardian> What rank is pat at chat?
[3:17:57] <$QueequegTheater> Badham isn't nearly as bad as Haddonfield
[3:18:00] <$QueequegTheater> @IronicGuardian 12
[3:18:03] <UncannyMatt> I despise indoor maps as both killer and survivor
[3:18:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> 13
[3:18:08] <+sekshun789> This stage is cool in design and theory but it's just "Hold W The Map" and it's sooooooooooo boring
[3:18:15] <chrishansen69_> Well, tomm hulett is an option..
[3:18:18] <hideyoshi_k> I would respectfully disagree on that
[3:18:23] <Oxybe> Hex: Lie, Cheat, Steal

[3:19:03] <Cheekynandos689> i watched all the Halloweens recently so i love playing Haddonfield
[3:19:07] <Djinnazz> they were all in there, lol
[3:19:13] <%Dementedpenguin> Everyone is there. Which means no gens being done LUL
[3:19:15] <%Agami23> weird question, do you have a killer you like to use when playing with friends more than playing solo?

[3:20:03] <+theKingRamses> not a mistake but it's a huge disadvantage @QueequegTheater
[3:20:20] <%BoxNavy> its cte

[3:20:46] <%BoxNavy> what was that
[3:20:50] <@SoFarFetched> that was the feng
[3:20:51] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:20:52] <huskarl_zap> whiff
[3:20:59] <$QueequegTheater> @theKingRamses Playing non strategy games on KBM feels like fucking trash though
[3:21:05] <$QueequegTheater> I need sticks
[3:21:07] <%AnIcedCoffee> No they got ruin
[3:21:15] <+CptDouglasJFalcon> ...I think they got Ruin.
[3:21:18] <@SoFarFetched> no Ruin is still there
[3:21:21] <@SoFarFetched> its lit up still.
[3:21:28] <+CptDouglasJFalcon> Undying tho
[3:21:31] <%AnIcedCoffee> Yes they did, it transferred
[3:21:32] <$QueequegTheater> You hit the one on the hook
[3:21:35] <bezzy_benz> they got ruin
[3:21:42] <chrishansen69_> All toes lead to quintin
[3:21:46] <spicystarbursts> this map and killer pairing feels unfair
[3:21:48] <rubbatt> they got ruin but it came back
[3:21:49] <bezzy_benz> but it transfered
[3:21:53] <%juxtest> They got Bruin, now they have to pretend to like hockey
[3:21:57] <%ChestMimik> Can killers turn their totems back on or does that last the match?
[3:22:05] <theemotionalacehearts> did he play as crack ma?
[3:22:08] <theemotionalacehearts> man
[3:22:10] <rubbatt> once its gone its gone
[3:22:13] <%bassoontyphoon> come back here shocker
[3:22:14] <+CptDouglasJFalcon> it lasts the match @ChestMimik
[3:22:14] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt If you think about it, the Earth's rotation and revolution means we're all just running in circles
[3:22:19] <spicystarbursts> totems stay off if turned off
[3:22:19] <%BoxNavy> PUT A FUCK ON THEM
[3:22:29] <rufus2k2> MOTHER A'MERCY
[3:22:32] <$joylent_blue> PUTTING A FUCK
[3:22:33] <@SoFarFetched> is the dog too heavy for peach
[3:22:37] <@SoFarFetched> cause I heard a "AW F UCK"
[3:22:46] <%nimu290> run bill run
[3:22:47] <blink289> Pat Which RE villian would you put in this game given the choice?
[3:22:52] <%Agami23> pyramid dust tried to put a fuck on him
[3:22:56] <$QueequegTheater> It was already used up though LUL
[3:23:04] <@SoFarFetched> yeah
[3:23:08] <%Jekado> they put in wesker instead
[3:23:08] <%BoxNavy> mr. sex
[3:23:10] <%Agami23> im surprised you wouldent want birkin
[3:23:10] <rufus2k2> what about the chick from REmake?
[3:23:14] <jellssssss20> Is this just a DbD night?
[3:23:14] <+SpareKeese> Yes
[3:23:18] <%ospreyworks> Not Jack Baker???
[3:23:18] <rufus2k2> the one in the coffin
[3:23:19] <nademonkey1100> what would his ability be
[3:23:20] <@SoFarFetched> Oh there goes haunted g round
[3:23:21] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:23:23] <%nimu290> he didnt run hard enough
[3:23:24] <rubbatt> he got haunted ground
[3:23:24] <%Visorak6> what would mr. x's gimmick be @PatStaresAt
[3:23:25] <OswaldTheDog> i’m so excited i took a nap AND got more pat n page adventures this is a good night
[3:23:30] <$joylent_blue> and his terror radius sound would just be HEAVY FOOTSTEPS
[3:23:30] <UncannyMatt> Aren't all RE protagonists too capable to be put in as survivors?
[3:23:32] <huskarl_zap> Man Eternal Crusade SUCKS
[3:23:40] <spicystarbursts> I am struggling to picture how a Small killer would work in this game, like Chuckie orless than regular sized
[3:23:45] <anAngryHamster> Lisa Trevor looks more thematically appropriate
[3:23:45] <+theKingRamses> wesker would work, just make his power the flashstepping
[3:23:46] <+CptDouglasJFalcon> Why X over someone like Nemesis?
[3:23:46] <%Aleate> Why not USTANAK??
[3:23:48] <vvitchguy> Ustanak lolol
[3:23:50] <%ospreyworks> I feel like Brikin could be cool, too
[3:23:51] <hideyoshi_k> Mr. X wouldn't have an active ability, he'd just be able to no-sell pallets and other stuns
[3:23:54] <%BoxNavy> hi
[3:23:55] <$QueequegTheater> Not Nemesis?
[3:24:01] <rufus2k2> @anAngryHamster that's the one!
[3:24:03] <zeif00> she's still exposed :O
[3:24:07] <$QueequegTheater> HG
[3:24:10] <$QueequegTheater> IT BEGINS
[3:24:13] <@SoFarFetched> nope too late
[3:24:17] <Oxybe> Mr X > Nemesis > Mama Bauer are my choices
[3:24:18] <%BoxNavy> mr. x is cooler cus he doesnt say things
[3:24:18] <rubbatt> rip
[3:24:19] <@SoFarFetched> he should have went for the meg that ran towards him
[3:24:20] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:24:21] <%nimu290> x would be cool
[3:24:26] <+yargne> no guys, we put in steve in monster form
[3:24:27] <+Das_Prints> @uncannymatt That doesn’t really stop Ash Williams from being a survivor considering he kills monsters and demons on the regular.
[3:24:35] <%justmildlilac> What what Mr.X's gimmick be? @PatStaresAt
[3:24:44] <+theKingRamses> nemesis without big gun would kinda suck imo
[3:24:56] <%nimu290> really hard punches
[3:24:59] <%ChestMimik> @justmildlilac He's gon' give it to ya'
[3:25:00] <%BoxNavy> i want a dinosaur to be a killer in this game
[3:25:06] <$QueequegTheater> You had the Meg
[3:25:06] <%BoxNavy> like a raptor or something
[3:25:10] <@SoFarFetched> is she the only one left
[3:25:12] <$QueequegTheater> Why let her go
[3:25:13] <rufus2k2> Nemesis still has the punch and tentacle
[3:25:19] <gruulmagebeast> for a sec i thought yall were talkin about mr x from mega man
[3:25:20] <$QueequegTheater> HG applies to all 4 survivors
[3:25:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> They should add Death Bed to this game
[3:25:24] <$QueequegTheater> Oh
[3:25:27] <+SoriduSnaku> a dinosaur killer would be dope
[3:25:29] <+CptDouglasJFalcon> So how soon do you think Undying is gonna get nerfed?
[3:25:33] <$QueequegTheater> Is tunnel
[3:25:35] <Oxybe> Nemesis is very grabby. Mr X just ignores pallets
[3:25:36] <blink289> Mr X has that charge right
[3:25:40] <$QueequegTheater> Toxic tunneler SMH
[3:25:44] <chrishansen69_> nemesis surely qualifies, I mean.. I do too.. but nemesis got a rocket launcher, he got the drop.. he got a zombie town not attacking him.. He got all the drops
[3:25:44] <spicystarbursts> If you guys added the GRUDGE into this game, how would you make it work?
[3:25:45] <anAngryHamster> The Bed that Eats People
[3:25:45] <UncannyMatt> @Das_Prints True, it'd just be really weird to see Chris be a babby running from killers even more than Ash
[3:25:56] <spicystarbursts> like grudge would be a teleporter
[3:25:59] <+theKingRamses> i don't see how you can nerf undying without changing what it does completely
[3:26:27] <spicystarbursts> or the girl from the ring
[3:26:27] <$QueequegTheater> upstairs
[3:26:33] <rufus2k2> @spicystarbursts grudge is less of a killer and more of a phenomenon
[3:26:40] <%BoxNavy> jesus she fuckin flipped
[3:26:40] <+CptDouglasJFalcon> yo nice they did a flip
[3:26:41] <@SoFarFetched> she must have thought she was on the second lfoor LUL
[3:26:43] <$QueequegTheater> @spicystarbursts Spirit is already that
[3:26:45] <rufus2k2> a cheating bullshit phenomenon that can't be beat
[3:26:45] <+theKingRamses> spirit kinda already does that @spicystarbursts
[3:26:46] <%chiazam> Is it over?
[3:26:47] <hideyoshi_k> The Spirit is already legally-distinct Grudge, but I suppose Billy didn't stop Bubba from getting in
[3:26:59] <%BoxNavy> ??
[3:27:08] <$QueequegTheater> Spirit is Ring, not Grudge
[3:27:10] <spicystarbursts> is Spirit supposed to be the ring girl?
[3:27:10] <+Das_Prints> @uncannymatt Fair point. Although you could argue it’d be for the same reason you could say why ash runs away in this which is they have no weapons on them.
[3:27:19] <%bassoontyphoon> I wonder if Chucky would ever be feasible as a killer?
[3:27:22] <+GrampsGrubberfly> secret tunnel
[3:27:22] <NonstopInfiniteOwls> gay by gay light
[3:27:26] <+CptDouglasJFalcon> Spirit's kinda both tbh
[3:27:28] <%nimu290> they would have to pick a weirdo who died as a survivor
[3:27:32] <+GrampsGrubberfly> secret tunnel. thru the mountain
[3:27:33] <spicystarbursts> how would a small killer hook people
[3:27:33] <+Das_Prints> It would still feel weird though I agree. I also think Ash running away in this also feels weird.
[3:27:34] <%BoxNavy> poo by pee light
[3:27:36] <%nimu290> if they do re
[3:27:38] <%chiazam> Is there like a guitar riff in the background music?
[3:27:47] <$QueequegTheater> SECRET TUNNEL
[3:27:48] <%BoxNavy> you did it clintHYPERS
[3:27:50] <Djinnazz> Wack a mole
[3:27:54] <Oxybe> obviously we need Herobrine. get them minecraft kids in on the Dead by Daylight.
[3:27:58] <rufus2k2> look at PH out for a leisurely stroll
[3:28:00] <spicystarbursts> picturing a small killer needing a stepstool to hook people
[3:28:02] <+freakfullmetal2> you can close it on him even if hes standing on it next time :D
[3:28:07] <UncannyMatt> @Das_Prints But Chris can punch someone so hard their head fuckin explodes
[3:28:07] <@SoFarFetched> did you even run into that bill the entire game?
[3:28:08] <Cheekynandos689> herobrine would be goat
[3:28:09] <+theKingRamses> @chiazam pyramid's head bgm has guitar i believe
[3:28:12] <hideyoshi_k> No way, The Spirit is way closer to Kayako than Sadako
[3:28:14] <%ChestMimik> Unironically Herobrine would be kinda cool to see
[3:28:19] <vvitchguy> The kids love Sanic
[3:28:21] <%GalacticaPhanto> why not Chuckys human form carrying the Nice Guys doll
[3:28:31] <@SoFarFetched> You used to be able to grab people as they were diving into the hatch.
[3:28:34] <$QueequegTheater> Should've closed it
[3:28:36] <UncannyMatt> and kept up with Wesker who can grab rockets out of mid air
[3:28:44] <ranarath> Dbd needs the Raincoat Killer and Francis York Morgan.
[3:28:49] <%justmildlilac> How would you guys feel about a FNaF character becoming a killer? I could see it, plus the pizzeria could be a fun map
[3:28:52] <chrishansen69_> SoriduSnaku, what is this?! "ignoring a giant disintegrating snake body".. Nice hole!
[3:28:56] <$QueequegTheater> @SoFarFetched Honestly it's good you can't anymore
[3:29:06] <@SoFarFetched> yeah I think its better that way
[3:29:18] <%BoxNavy> blood flavour
[3:29:21] <+Das_Prints> My dream add would still be The Thing that disguises. Then you give him a little something extra as a mechanic so he still has something going for him when the disguise isn’t needed anymore or if the survivors are using voice chat.
[3:29:24] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:29:25] <%bassoontyphoon> @justmildlilac it'd be interesting but weird to pull off with the game's red light green light style of gameplay
[3:29:25] <%ChestMimik> @justmildlilac Doe sthe survivor have to be MattPat?
[3:29:29] <%nimu290> @justmildlilac who would be survivor
[3:29:38] <$QueequegTheater> That's too many cakes, share with the class
[3:29:40] <vvitchguy> Fnaf is a cool idea. Use that bunny from 3.
[3:29:46] <anAngryHamster> at@galacticaphanto That just defeats the point, it's supposed to be a killer doll
[3:29:52] <HitchhikingThrough> Oh god that was super weird
[3:29:58] <spicystarbursts> Oh god I just imagined a new Killer: The NUN
[3:30:02] <%BoxNavy> baone
[3:30:03] <$QueequegTheater> Blood Flavor
[3:30:10] <$QueequegTheater> FLAVORTOWN
[3:30:17] <UncannyMatt> LUL
[3:30:20] <hideyoshi_k> The next licensed killer I'm hoping for is Pinhead
[3:30:24] <@SoFarFetched> Oktoberfest Kate PogChamp
[3:30:29] <+theKingRamses> @nimu290 don't really need to have a survivor tied to dlc, leatherface and ghostface never got one i believe
[3:30:38] <%GalacticaPhanto> @anangryhamster how about its ability it turns into a doll but you have to be human to hook
[3:30:39] <@SoFarFetched> Ghostface has one
[3:30:40] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> sadako from ringu would be a neat new flavor
[3:30:43] <%BoxNavy> i dont have that button
[3:30:48] <Oxybe> Guy Fiery as survivor/ Gordon Ramsey as killer
[3:30:49] <+robert_edwards> Chat, How is DBD on ps4 currently?
[3:30:49] <HitchhikingThrough> Shit damn he sure hitting em
[3:30:53] <%justmildlilac> @nimu290 It'd have to be the security guard from 1 I guess, idk if they had a name tho
[3:30:54] <spicystarbursts> Who are the other classic horror creepos? Pinhead, Babadook, Candyman, Nun, a literal Demon, etc
[3:31:01] <UncannyMatt> I want them to actually add a Werewolf killer
[3:31:04] <Oxybe> Flavourtown map
[3:31:06] <blink289> The should make Pyramid head's hearbeat radio static
[3:31:07] <huskarl_zap> OH SHIT
[3:31:07] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Just give hatch, that does it
[3:31:09] <%Ranryu692> Lying
[3:31:10] <@SoFarFetched> SPIRIT BASKETBALL
[3:31:11] <%BoxNavy> hooray
[3:31:11] <%ChestMimik> Baller
[3:31:14] <+theKingRamses> i want a vampire in game
[3:31:14] <+Das_Prints> @spicystarbursts The Thing
[3:31:15] <$joylent_blue> yayyy more Supergiant
[3:31:15] <%nimu290> he doesnt have a face
[3:31:18] <huskarl_zap> That sounds like a cult thing/
[3:31:19] <vvitchguy> We need like a killer robot.
[3:31:21] <VirtuaRailith> Pyre is great
[3:31:22] <%SirGO0SE> we ballllin
[3:31:23] <OperatorJo_> P Y R E
[3:31:25] <%BoxNavy> ghostketball
[3:31:25] <UncannyMatt> and not cuck us with a Scottish drug addict instead
[3:31:28] <chrishansen69_> That baone will be the good ending, the good ending will be the buttoane
[3:31:30] <HitchhikingThrough> Cold fucking take
[3:31:32] <%justmildlilac> I really want Candyman, they're one of my favorite horror characters
[3:31:33] <hideyoshi_k> The Terminator
[3:31:35] <OperatorJo_> literally saved the best for last
[3:31:43] <%GalacticaPhanto> @patstaresat Did you ever like 13 Sentinels?
[3:31:43] <%cowardlord> Good game
[3:31:44] <%ChestMimik> The terminator seems like an obvious pick for a killer
[3:31:45] <%bassoontyphoon> the next killer should be randy pitchford (alledgedly)
[3:31:47] <Oxybe> Candyman would be fucking sick
[3:31:49] <spicystarbursts> Krampus as the new Christmas Killer please
[3:31:53] <%BoxNavy> he turns into a mouth?
[3:32:02] <%nimu290> @justmildlilac mike is his name but he doesnt have a face
[3:32:06] <ranarath> Christine, the car, as a new killer.
[3:32:11] <@SoFarFetched> yeah cause chat would probably spoil stuff.
[3:32:12] <%Ranryu692> does Paige have any plans to stream sometime soon?
[3:32:12] <%BoxNavy> is the saturday mystery stream still happening?
[3:32:13] <%cowardlord> very melancholic
[3:32:23] <chrishansen69_> Do it
[3:32:27] <+CptDouglasJFalcon> Man when are we getting the peepee poopoo man as a killer
[3:32:28] <%Agami23> oh boy, david firth is fighting wish because they keep selling bootleg salad fingers stuff
[3:32:29] <%chiazam> Chucky?
[3:32:36] <vvitchguy> Recently watched Candyman completely. Scared me as a kid a lot. It's still great.
[3:32:37] <blink289> If they put a vampire in the game I want its mori to be the vampire the masquerade dance
[3:32:43] <%bassoontyphoon> @chiazam id be super down
[3:32:44] <%Anime_Flux> nice
[3:32:47] <%juxtest> New mode where Ash is the killer and the killers are the survivors
[3:32:50] <%justmildlilac> @PatStaresAt Thoughts on a FNaF character as a new killer?
[3:32:55] <%GalacticaPhanto> She would just be the Daytona fighter from Fighting Vipers
[3:32:59] <+theKingRamses> if i can't get a vampire like i want in game, give me the mummy with brendan fraser as survivor dlc
[3:33:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt oh pat Plague said he was having trouble with a vtuber thing if he wants help im bored enough to help anyone otherwise i might do a stupid southpark canadian pat for a joke
[3:33:02] <%justmildlilac> Lol
[3:33:05] <spicystarbursts> What about a killer with a Bee theme?
[3:33:07] <hideyoshi_k> Does Demogorgon count as a suitably eldritch killer, or could we get someone even more tentacle-filled?
[3:33:12] <%GalacticaPhanto> Sorry Fighters Megamix
[3:33:15] <spicystarbursts> like creates swarms around the map
[3:33:19] <%chiazam> FNAF killer??
[3:33:20] <+CaptainKarite> toe tems
[3:33:25] <ranarath> @justmildlilac Pat doesn't know much about FNaF.
[3:33:28] <%BoxNavy> he needs those toe tems you guys
[3:33:29] <Mr_Strut> Not the totans
[3:33:34] <%ChestMimik> Post totem picks
[3:33:36] <%justmildlilac> Ah, fair enough
[3:33:36] <vvitchguy> Heihachi new killer.
[3:33:37] <chrishansen69_> I Am a toe tam.. Fight me!
[3:33:38] <Oxybe> We could go full cthulu mythos.
[3:33:49] <UncannyMatt> Slenderman killer when
[3:33:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> PIRATE GHOST
[3:33:53] <%TakingLifesL> Tucker and Dale as new survivors?
[3:34:03] <$RealThiele> Phantasm ORB as killer
[3:34:06] <chrishansen69_> Kill me harder doc_ock_rokc
[3:34:15] <%BoxNavy> youre icing these losers
[3:34:19] <VirtuaRailith> Nicolas Cage as survivor and Nicolas Cage as killer
[3:34:20] <%BoxNavy> EEEEH
[3:34:22] <hideyoshi_k> Heihachi's power is that he just juggles you for 60%
[3:34:23] <%edwardskacz> I've always wanted a Winter Lantern (or Gascoigne) from Bloodborne as a killer
[3:34:23] <%justmildlilac> I guess they could use the King in Yellow if they want some eldritch stuff
[3:34:24] <@SoFarFetched> Todd Howard as new Killer: His thing is making you install Skyrim and hear him talk about Skyrim.
[3:34:25] <Mr_Strut> Pat still styling on noobs?
[3:34:27] <AngryCaterpillar> Tucker and Dale as new survivors
[3:34:31] <chrishansen69_> RealThiele, Ill be a phantom pain like this..
[3:34:33] <blink289> Should I be concerned my 5 year old plays kid versions of dead by daylight
[3:34:34] <Oxybe> just a big old squidface and some 1800's detective librarian guy from like, maine or something
[3:34:36] <AngryCaterpillar> But also Tucker and Dale as new Killer
[3:34:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @chrishansen69_ Pirate ghost who is headless and uses his head as a means of hunting people down
[3:34:38] <chrishansen69_> Do it swifter!
[3:34:38] <vvitchguy> XD
[3:34:40] <$RealThiele> Nicolas cage as Nicolas Cage
[3:34:40] <%BoxNavy> ?
[3:34:43] <%GalacticaPhanto> Todd Howard and he teleports you to another port of Skyrim
[3:34:47] <Mr_Strut> Outskilled
[3:34:48] <%Profmcstevie> Billy Mays here! Do I have a hook for you!
[3:35:01] <hideyoshi_k> @Oxybe Make him the guy from The Dunwitch Horror
[3:35:03] <%bassoontyphoon> id be down for a "frankenstein's monster" styled killer
[3:35:04] <%justmildlilac> @GalacticaPhanto Ah, you're finally awake
[3:35:05] <$RealThiele> billy mays would be a survivor with speed boosting
[3:35:05] <chrishansen69_> doc_ock_rokc, Im just confused now
[3:35:06] <Mr_Strut> I wish Billy Mays narrated my life
[3:35:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @chrishansen69_ nevermind
[3:35:32] <+CptDouglasJFalcon> Have you seen The Thing? If you have, how do you think the eponymous Thing would work as a Killer in DBD?
[3:35:34] <Oxybe> @hideyoshi_k yes!
[3:35:53] <AngryCaterpillar> Thing Killer would impersonate survivors a la TF2 Spy
[3:35:58] <%juxtest> Kiryu as new Totally Doesn't Killer
[3:36:02] <%BoxNavy> would The Thing just be legion but meaty
[3:36:02] <%justmildlilac> DBD becomes 3rd person Among Us
[3:36:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> @CptDouglasJFalcon Every person it strikes it can change into them for a brief amount of time
[3:36:23] <Oxybe> NO MAJIMA AS KILLER
[3:36:23] <%chiazam> That'd be pretty meta
[3:36:26] <+CaptainKarite> fuck friends, I gotta live
[3:36:26] <UncannyMatt> Wasn't Legion supposed to be an impersonation killer?
[3:36:29] <VirtuaRailith> @CptDouglasJFalcon Pat did a commentary track of The Thing with Plauge and Paige on Plague's youtube channel
[3:36:29] <%GalacticaPhanto> yeah pretty much what Legion was supposed to be. man that was disappointing
[3:36:29] <Oxybe> MAJIMA EVERYWHER SYSTEM<
[3:36:33] <hideyoshi_k> It's be hard to capture Carpenter's the Thing as a killer, but the 1951 Thing From Another World?
[3:36:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> @UncannyMatt intitally yes
[3:36:45] <Mr_Strut> What about the dominatrix as a killer?
[3:36:47] <%BoxNavy> toe TEM
[3:36:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> Blob Killer
[3:36:55] <%Anime_Flux> Have at thee, wench
[3:37:02] <chrishansen69_> What just even happened? I wasnt in on the joke.. I felt it was mean, thoughtful and not even funny.. still dont get it
[3:37:08] <AngryCaterpillar> Plan 9 From Outer Space Killer
[3:37:11] <$RealThiele> have the Thing be able to look like a survivor as a CD
[3:37:13] <+CaptainKarite> oktoberfest
[3:37:14] <%BoxNavy> what about a killer from a horror movie? would you like that chat?
[3:37:15] <%Anime_Flux> Oktoberfest
[3:37:17] <Mr_Strut> She's just a hippie
[3:37:21] <UncannyMatt> A shame they didn't stick with that would've been cool, if not the most meta
[3:37:22] <Oxybe> You thought it was a generator? IT WAS ME, MAJIMA!
[3:37:29] <%GalacticaPhanto> oh god, Kiryu as the survivor and that sex crazed dude from Y0
[3:37:39] <SteveJobsIsStillAlive> forest kayson new killer confirmed (by my coffee)
[3:37:39] <zeif00> that dwight is gonna finish that gen
[3:37:39] <Mr_Strut> no bulli
[3:37:42] <Oxybe> SURE WOULD BE A SHAME IF IT WAS MAJIMA IN THAT BOX
[3:37:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> It looks like it's a diner waitress outfit
[3:37:45] <spicystarbursts> I wonder if Carrie from the stephen king books would make an interesting killer
[3:37:50] <chrishansen69_> Im not new.. till dont get lame jokes though
[3:37:59] <AngryCaterpillar> Cujo for new killer
[3:38:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> Christine would be an interesting killer
[3:38:05] <Oxybe> Boy that's a Majima shaped pallett
[3:38:15] <$RealThiele> devil car killer LUL
[3:38:19] <+Senney> BODY BREAK
[3:38:19] <%Anime_Flux> nicely done
[3:38:21] <Mr_Strut> I don't
[3:38:26] <hideyoshi_k> Ohh, or how about a Big Daddy! "The Protector"
[3:38:26] <%ChestMimik> A Big Daddy would be a cool killer
[3:38:27] <%BoxNavy> that joke was for someone
[3:38:37] <%Profmcstevie> Clearly Kiryu would be a survivor running from Majima
[3:38:38] <Oxybe> WITH HAL JOHNSON AND JOANNE MCCLOUD
[3:38:39] <Rozalyndis> 21 raiders from Rozalyndis have joined! 
[3:38:40] <vvitchguy> Velociraptor killer.
[3:38:44] <%Anime_Flux> whoopsie
[3:38:45] <%miabyte> ROZ RAID AND STUFF
[3:38:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> Manikan killer that jumps between bodies?
[3:38:47] <%uncle_grumps> Git 'em!
[3:38:53] <+theKingRamses> dinosaur killer would be sick
[3:38:56] <hideyoshi_k> Make his power involve the survivors having to collect Little Sisters and having to defend them
[3:38:57] <HitchhikingThrough> oh shit is roz
[3:39:03] <@SoFarFetched> @Rozalyndis Thanks for the raid,Roz! psaUp psaUp
[3:39:04] <%TakingLifesL> Tucker and Dale as survivors with the ability to randomly create hazardous obstacles when pursued by the killer.
[3:39:08] <+SpareKeese> A raptor as a killer would be sweet
[3:39:08] <Rozalyndis> it sure is
[3:39:19] <+Mundkipz> i left pat to go to roz, and roz sends me right back
[3:39:19] <zeif00> psaBlind
[3:39:20] <spicystarbursts> Weeping Angel killer from Doctor Who
[3:39:26] <chrishansen69_> Yeah okay, ghost bust me away, I will stay anyway, cause i feel its a bad investment
[3:39:27] <Rozalyndis> i get to finally watch pat wreck *someone else* at this game!
[3:39:27] <Oxybe> Hex: Clever Girl
[3:39:29] <AngryCaterpillar> T-Rex killer that can only see survivors when they move
[3:39:33] <UncannyMatt> Raptor? How about a xenomorph?
[3:39:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> They should make a They Live killer.
[3:39:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> @spicystarbursts Ghostface already KINDA does that
[3:39:41] <%SirGO0SE> Hi Roz quiettSuperdab
[3:39:51] <Mr_Strut> don't get cocky
[3:39:53] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @chrishansen69_ how are you no 1 sub gifter if you dont like lame jokes btw, pat is a walking (or rolling) groan factory
[3:39:55] <@SoFarFetched> @Mundkipz Don't Forget, you're here forever.
[3:39:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> Everyone looks like a survivor until you find the sunglasses
[3:39:57] <vvitchguy> All good ideas <3
[3:39:58] <DianaTheAscian> Inglorious bath stewards
[3:40:04] <silentblast93> so nuffed
[3:40:12] <spicystarbursts> I mean, would having a survivor constantly have eyes on a weeping angel killer be interesting or boring
[3:40:32] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> boring and not good for asynch pvp
[3:40:33] <%bassoontyphoon> @spicystarbursts i dont think it'd work with the gameplay
[3:40:38] <hideyoshi_k> It's good, but not stronger than before by any means
[3:40:39] <pk_piss> probably boring
[3:40:40] <Ninjalettuce> what is a nublet
[3:40:41] <chrishansen69_> sashagreenspiderqueen, my jobs are lamer
[3:40:45] <%TakingLifesL> one survivor could just stun lock it tho
[3:40:49] <%IDTheftVictim> they'd have to implement a blink feature
[3:40:55] <HitchhikingThrough> uh
[3:40:56] <%Anime_Flux> I'm fond of the idea of Sadako/Samara. Instead of hooks, when you catch a survivor, they have 7 minutes to live.
[3:40:57] <Paperware> Chicken Nubblet
[3:40:58] <gankthehobbit> Hey I know this random to ask but who is on the pillow ?
[3:40:59] <%Agami23> no but really, what is it?
[3:41:00] <Oxybe> a chimken nublet
[3:41:01] <Mr_Strut> no u
[3:41:03] <Ninjalettuce> uh
[3:41:04] <%shurtal> nublets and gizzards
[3:41:04] <$Dakuu75> get that ONE GUY outa here lol
[3:41:10] <HitchhikingThrough> I mean
[3:41:10] <silentblast93> pat we areant old like you
[3:41:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> answer the question, nublet.

[3:48:17] <spicystarbursts> New killer power= invade a dead body. Start off as a swarm character like a man made of bees
[3:48:22] <+SpareKeese> BEES
[3:48:24] <%TakingLifesL> anti-masker as a killer, applies a disease DOT to survivors
[3:48:25] <ranarath> Well, the mori will make survivors look kinda like pizza.
[3:48:28] <DedlokPM> When the moon hits your eye like a big ol pizza pie, that's a mori
[3:48:31] <AngryCaterpillar> When you get pulled off first hook and the killer's a crook that's a mori
[3:48:31] <%BoxNavy> lets gooo moon2W
[3:48:37] <%Broand> If you see some sweet gear that does not flip oveer Thaaaaat's a mori
[3:48:38] <AngryCaterpillar> When you bring them a cake and it's a mistake, that's a mori

[3:48:46] <%BoxNavy> your morays
[3:48:48] <%Anime_Flux> get yer morties
[3:48:53] <%BoxNavy> like the eel
[3:49:01] <+Das_Prints> It begins.
[3:49:03] <%Rozalyndis> i hope the next killer is valak (the nun)
[3:49:08] <%SirGO0SE> @AngryCaterpillar LUL
[3:49:08] <$RealThiele> well you see, a nickel had a picture of a bee on it at the time, so when you trade in a quarter youd say "Gimme 5 bees"
[3:49:09] <%Rozalyndis> she seems like she'd be a GREAT killer
[3:49:16] <%ChestMimik> It means no moris for the rest of your days
[3:49:16] <%Broand> Do you only get so many moris a day?
[3:49:18] <+NonHolographic> oo i love quiet mountain

[3:50:39] <+SpareKeese> hahahha
[3:50:47] <hideyoshi_k> Killer Idea: A Sasquatch/Yeti, because the Bigfoot from A Goofy Movie scared me as a kid
[3:50:54] <@SoFarFetched> TUNNEL SNAKES RULE
[3:50:55] <%Anime_Flux> tunnel snakes rule
[3:50:56] <AngryCaterpillar> When survivors bring keys and you do not feel pleased, that's a mori
[3:51:03] <ECRead> IT'S RAD
[3:51:04] <@SoFarFetched> its "alright"
[3:51:04] <HeroToxiko> K O
[3:51:05] <%BoxNavy> ahh ahh
[3:51:10] <%bassoontyphoon> Harry and Marv as new survivors, with Kevin McAllister as the new Killer?
[3:51:14] <@SoFarFetched> mayeb because its too short for me
[3:51:15] <%ChestMimik> Literally twisting the knife
[3:51:15] <+SpareKeese> OH
[3:51:16] <spicystarbursts> @hideyoshi_k so a REALLY Tall killer then
[3:51:19] <hideyoshi_k> Remember, it's stab, then twist
[3:51:19] <+SpareKeese> WOW
[3:51:21] <Manwad> a bit jank but really mean
[3:51:22] <bustawof> Red zoneDESTROYED
[3:51:26] <%Aleate> Shoulda put her upside down in a cage tfu2
[3:51:26] <%justmildlilac> Fatality
[3:51:30] <%za7az> FUNNEL CAKES RULE!
[3:51:30] <%Rozalyndis> it would be cooler if pyramid head ripped their skin off or something
[3:51:30] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Damn.
[3:51:36] <%Typhaeon> Hag's is still the best
[3:51:46] <Oxybe> When they fail on the gen and you hook them again, that's a mori!
[3:51:46] <ancrest_tant> How do you twist a sword like that?
[3:51:47] <%bassoontyphoon> @Rozalyndis itd be too hard to model i think
[3:51:48] <@SoFarFetched> @Rozalyndis see thats what I THOUGHT they were going to do.
[3:51:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> They should make Goofy a killer
[3:51:55] <Srthunda> personally, I really like doc's mori
[3:51:59] <$RealThiele> funnel cake is pretty good with raspberry
[3:52:00] <Mr_Strut> She knows
[3:52:09] <%Agami23> yeah but it wasent.
[3:52:21] <spicystarbursts> Any ideas for Christmas themed killer aside from Krampus?
[3:52:22] <%chiazam> sick
[3:52:23] <@SoFarFetched> @Rozalyndis but I guess it would have been hard to do skinning.
[3:52:33] <%Anime_Flux> Jack Frost
[3:52:37] <%BoxNavy> pat do something cool right now
[3:52:43] <%bassoontyphoon> I think it'd be cool if there was a crow-based killer
[3:52:48] <@SoFarFetched> @spicystarbursts killer snowman Kappa
[3:52:49] <%Rozalyndis> @Rozalyndis possibly? it all depends on if they could make everyone's model have a layer beneath of just flesh and blood and then damage they take just removes bits of that layer? like how they do it in killing floor 2?
[3:52:49] <$RealThiele> wendigo
[3:52:50] <%Anime_Flux> or the turkey from Thankskilling
[3:52:57] <TheApeGatsby> Dang how is ruin still up
[3:53:01] <Midnight188> is Wraith really worst Killer now? or is it still Freddy?
[3:53:06] <UncannyMatt> greedy
[3:53:11] <@SoFarFetched> Wraith is worse,Freddy is A Tier
[3:53:11] <$RealThiele> a swarm of turkey as a killer
[3:53:20] <%Ranryu692> when are they gonna put the killer from Too Many Cooks in?
[3:53:20] <@SoFarFetched> Wraith is C tier
[3:53:25] <+Das_Prints> They reworked Freddy a while ago and made him one of the better killers.
[3:53:26] <+Soliloquy123> Freddy got reworked into near god tier
[3:53:26] <spicystarbursts> I hate playing against Wraith and playing as Wraith
[3:53:32] <Mr_Strut> Really?
[3:53:36] <%BoxNavy> fredrick
[3:53:36] <TheApeGatsby> I thought Clown was the worst? Wraith has really good add-ons
[3:53:40] <@SoFarFetched> @Rozalyndis Yeah I feel if Pyramid head was like after all the updates to the maps/models. They probably could have gotten aWay with it.
[3:53:42] <AngryCaterpillar> When survivors declare that "This just isn't fair!" that's a mori
[3:53:44] <+Soliloquy123> Clown is generally considered the worst killer
[3:53:47] <%Agami23> i like playing killers who are real mean. like doctor or the shape
[3:53:52] <@SoFarFetched> So far the C tier killers are: Clown,Trapper,Pig,Wraith.
[3:53:52] <%chiazam> How good is PH actually?
[3:53:56] <%bassoontyphoon> @Rozalyndis I feel like that might be too much effort for them for one animation though. I agree it'd be super cool to see though
[3:54:00] <%BoxNavy> get fucked
[3:54:00] <@SoFarFetched> Pyramid Head is A Tier
[3:54:02] <HitchhikingThrough> Yo this seems fucked up
[3:54:04] <spicystarbursts> pH is top tier killer
[3:54:06] <%Anime_Flux> omae wa mou shindeiru
[3:54:07] <HitchhikingThrough> Do you not have to hook them?
[3:54:13] <blink289> You think nancy lived
[3:54:15] <@SoFarFetched> Spirit used to be S Tier but she's now back to top A Tier
[3:54:16] <%chiazam> Why was that animation extra fucked up?
[3:54:17] <hideyoshi_k> @spicystarbursts So the tallest killer we have now is Plague at 7'1''. Sasquatch range between 6'6'' and 10'. So at their shortest they'd be about Myers height. But that's only if the devs are cowards.
[3:54:20] <Mr_Strut> The range attack seems really op
[3:54:20] <UncannyMatt> Clown is like D
[3:54:22] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> only once hitch
[3:54:24] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> then he can insta
[3:54:42] <spicystarbursts> wait plauge is 7ft 1???
[3:54:47] <@SoFarFetched> yeah she's fucking big
[3:54:54] <ECRead> I actually really like Wraith. but only with thick mist, bone clapper, the ghost, and info perks
[3:55:01] <HitchhikingThrough> Oh christ. Dodes that only last as long as someone is on the hook?
[3:55:10] <ECRead> Clown's def worse
[3:55:12] <HitchhikingThrough> Or does he have it forever now
[3:55:17] <CrimsonFox777> @hideyoshi_k Had to do a double-take there. I got the Plague and the Blight mixed up for a second.
[3:55:21] <%BoxNavy> e
[3:55:28] <@SoFarFetched> @Rozalyndis I actually kind of wish if they do more with Mori's later,you can choose which Mori you want to do. But that's just me hoping. Since Pyramid Head has two animations.
[3:55:37] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @HitchhikingThrough its a consumable, his memento mori
[3:55:41] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> p sure its consumed at least
[3:56:01] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> so its only one match afaik
[3:56:11] <spicystarbursts> Omg that Casen guy from the Swery game as the new Killer
[3:56:16] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah once a Mori is used on a match,it's gone afterwards.
[3:56:19] <HitchhikingThrough> He's done it twice though
[3:56:23] <@SoFarFetched> Since offerings are consumables.
[3:56:24] <AngryCaterpillar> Not enough gens done I think?
[3:56:35] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> its the entire match, but only this oneo
[3:56:35] <$RealThiele> office building map would be great
[3:56:39] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> its gone after
[3:56:39] <HitchhikingThrough> unless I'm not paying attention well
[3:56:42] <@SoFarFetched> @AngryCaterpillar if there's only one survivor left even with 5 gens not finished. Hatch will always open for the one survivor.
[3:56:53] <%apostateCourier> Naw, if there's gonna be a Deadly Premonition killer it's going to be the Raincoat Killer.
[3:56:55] <%Rozalyndis> @SoFarFetched i'd be interested in seeing a mori for someone like pig, where she jams the bear trap on, then stands up and the timer just goes off and the thing rips the skull open?
[3:56:59] <%Rozalyndis> that'd be neat
[3:56:59] <%Anime_Flux> surprise
[3:57:07] <spicystarbursts> @RealThiele the real killer in the office is MONOTONY
[3:57:10] <AngryCaterpillar> Yeah but it hasn't spawned yet because there are two survivors alive, one couldn't be camping on it yet
[3:57:24] <AngryCaterpillar> Keep a stiff upper lip 'cus you're gonna depip, that's a mori
[3:57:27] <@SoFarFetched> @AngryCaterpillar oh there's still one LUL maybe he's waiting next to the hatch until the survivor dies
[3:57:28] <$RealThiele> Joblin inc is the real killer
[3:57:31] <seaechiowai> wow this dude is almost a 1k viewer stream
[3:57:35] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @AngryCaterpillar afaik it spawns from minute one but is just invisible?
[3:57:36] <HitchhikingThrough> Yeah I'm going to be real with you all
[3:57:38] <+AMagicalFlute> Oh baby a TRIPLE
[3:57:41] <%bassoontyphoon> DO YOU THINK SHELL BE OKAY?
[3:57:41] <%BoxNavy> ahh ah ah
[3:57:41] <HitchhikingThrough> That seems like more than once a match
[3:57:50] <%Anime_Flux> no escape
[3:57:54] <CrimsonFox777> Pretty sure her body would be in halves, but ok.
[3:57:54] <%Rozalyndis> hahaha you are such an ass
[3:57:55] <%Anime_Flux> sort of
[3:57:56] <%cowardlord> DAMN
[3:57:59] <+SausageShogun> sugoiWoah no mercy
[3:58:00] <@SoFarFetched> @Rozalyndis ooooo yeah that would be nice. I actually forgot what Pig's mori was,but it probably wasn't that memorable for me.
[3:58:00] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @HitchhikingThrough its "one match" not once a match
[3:58:04] <AngryCaterpillar> @sashagreenspiderqueen Exactly, so the survivor couldn't be waiting next to it because it's not actually visible to be sat on
[3:58:05] <spicystarbursts> so is 1k on twitch like... a lot?
[3:58:10] <%bassoontyphoon> @HitchhikingThrough you can use the moris only during this one match per mori token
[3:58:10] <HitchhikingThrough> Ahh
[3:58:14] <@SoFarFetched> @Rozalyndis or rather me'mori'able Kappa
[3:58:17] <%bluetocho13> let them go pat you have enough points
[3:58:18] <HitchhikingThrough> Now I get it
[3:58:30] <%Anime_Flux> bye bye
[3:58:35] <AngryCaterpillar> When your teammates' all dead and you're against Pyramid Head that's a mori!
[3:58:37] <%justmildlilac> GG
[3:58:38] <+Das_Prints> @hitchhikingthrough I you use the ebony rarity version you can use it on everyone in a match after their first hook.
[3:58:44] <Oxybe> BIG MURDER FOR BIG PAT
[3:58:45] <%Rozalyndis> pattyPun HahaBall @farfetched
[3:58:47] <%BoxNavy> you. did it
[3:58:49] <%AzureGale> DOMINATED
[3:58:53] <%Anime_Flux> grats!
[3:58:56] <$RealThiele> toxic power!
[3:58:58] <@SoFarFetched> @HitchhikingThrough certain mori's either let you kill one specific person,or everyone.
[3:58:59] <ergulor> That gg was toxic
[3:58:59] <%Typhaeon> I want to see salt
[3:59:03] <+Link232> Saying GG after a mori game feels a bit like BM
[3:59:04] <%bassoontyphoon> you defeated the vvymyn
[3:59:04] <%Typhaeon> Come on survivors
[3:59:08] <HitchhikingThrough> Oh pat wants that salt huh.
[3:59:11] <UncannyMatt> nobody will ever gg a mori game LUL
[3:59:12] <+Arxius> Pat you were supposed to hook them!
[3:59:12] <%bluetocho13> Toxic
[3:59:16] <spicystarbursts> Pats real killer power is the sow salt
[3:59:16] <@SoFarFetched> @Rozalyndis look I had to add it after I realized the pun after I typed it,I didn't want it to go to waste. sipsipDab
[3:59:17] <%BoxNavy> that was GM
[3:59:22] <HitchhikingThrough> O O F

[3:59:28] <hideyoshi_k> You could make DP a paragraph and it'd be fine. Nobody cares about the killers in that series, just get us survivor Francis York Morgan (But you can call him York, that's what everyone calls him).
