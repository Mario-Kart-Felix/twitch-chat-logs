[0:31:19] <dekkitout> 4:9 classic?
[0:31:20] <%Ipsenscastle> Fullscreen classic turns your TV into a CRT
[0:31:24] <%RealThiele> im getting Carrion vibes atm
[0:31:25] <%BoxNavy> NO
[0:31:25] <+tigerfang86> Mute Puking

[0:31:42] <spongeofmystery> MORE puking
[0:31:43] <Profmcstevie> Bass boost that puke
[0:31:44] <+blaze__drag> if anything put geif on stream for extra barf

[0:31:45] <%cvp5127> put more puking
[0:31:45] <%DakotaMacDoodle> barf
[0:31:46] <MayorRev> VOMIT = ON

[0:32:02] <+Cobaltor_252> no way custom button prompts
[0:32:03] <+alpharius88> LOCAL CO OP
[0:32:04] <Daxalog> Leave puke on its important
[0:32:05] <%Archphronimos> Fun fact: studies have shown that the sound of a human vomiting is the most universally unpleasant sound to humans in general
[0:32:06] <%RealThiele> good amount of options for an early game
[0:32:09] <%emperordread> emperordread subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months, currently on a 19 month streak! I like when you play the games I know nothing about. Hardspace Shipbreaker rules
[0:32:10] <yourliteraldog> Scat and Urine sliders
[0:32:13] <+Wh0WantsToast> is there a max puking option
[0:32:14] <%doctordinkus> why is controller glyph setting universal
[0:32:17] <SmigGames> puking mechanics
[0:32:20] <%doctordinkus> not*
[0:32:24] <mybassgotblasted9000> will you be playing ace attorney again?
[0:32:30] <%aWanderingKaivo> veganism mode lol
[0:32:32] <+zuzuxiv> that's unpleasant
[0:32:34] <allanmiri> So the way this game was discribed to me by a youtuber I like was someone said, "If you don't like Fallout I'd like to see you do better!!!!" and the guy who made this game was like, "Alright."
[0:32:36] <dds333a> no exp, ooh
[0:32:38] <%BoxNavy> it WILL be monkaS
[0:32:41] <%RealThiele> ace attorney seems unlikely it kills his throat

[0:50:43] <+MisterAvry> "amusement" is an ominous word he used
[0:50:47] <robosqueeb> endless trash!
[0:50:48] <ChloeFleurage> "You're my fren now, we're having soft tacos later"
[0:50:48] <%Jekado> i feel like they added a few things since the demo i played

[0:51:51] <%crimsonharvest> can you slap those crystals?
[0:51:51] <allanmiri> The flesh stuff makes this the most interesting post apocalypse setting I've seen in awhile.
[0:51:57] <%aWanderingKaivo> vomitpunk
[0:51:58] <the_28_house> wtf is this game and how can I play it

[0:52:39] <SaltyAzteca> Ambience, gives me that Hyper Light vibe
[0:52:44] <Profmcstevie> Electronic sounds are eerie as fuck

[0:55:24] <zerointelligence000> maybe get naked in front of him?
[0:55:39] <%GabeSweetMan> NO SEX FOR YOU!
[0:55:45] <+MisterAvry> puke on him
[0:55:45] <$lotharrio> But is the reason the same?
[0:55:52] <StarlitStunner> Fopal
[0:55:56] <%RealThiele> robot society rejected
[0:56:33] <$realm_forge> @patstaresat did you ever play the dlcs for Fallout 3?
[0:56:41] <DrkJP520> Ye, stab him with that club!
[0:56:42] <allanmiri> GIVE ME YOUR SOUL
[0:56:52] <DSD24> Point Lookout was the best
[0:56:56] <%RealThiele> was that bush sparkling?
[0:57:05] <%Romuken> tame meat
[0:57:06] <+MisterAvry> what now
[0:57:08] <StarlitStunner> Point Lookout had swamp rednecks
[0:57:08] <olm46> Pat's the kinda guy to eat organs to save his medpacks.
[0:57:09] <%RealThiele> oh its just the animation
[0:57:14] <$lotharrio> There's only one reason for F3 DLC, and it's retconning all your companions smiling and telling you to go kill yourself.
[0:57:27] <allanmiri> Zeta is dumb, but kinda fun if you like dumb shit. Broken steel shoulda been in the main game, Point Lookout is good and Ancorage is meh.
[0:57:40] <RLT917> LUL
[0:57:41] <+Birdigalore> This ambient music is unsettling
[0:57:49] <%Romuken> tame worm, throw at uglies?
[0:57:50] <DSD24> Fawkes I need you to something for me "Nah man its your destiny to die"
[0:57:50] <$lotharrio> How much XP though?
[0:57:51] <dekkitout> @allanmiri And Pitt?
[0:57:51] <%Romuken> YES
[0:57:52] <allanmiri> The Pit DLC is the best.
[0:57:53] <+thelonechris> Yes
[0:57:55] <SaltyAzteca> yes Kappa
[0:57:56] <%BoxNavy> no
[0:58:00] <%ironohki> It's very fleshy on the surface.
[0:58:01] <+MisterAvry> I like how there's just mounds of gore scattered around
[0:58:10] <%crimsonharvest> does the fleshworm have an inventory description
[0:58:22] <allanmiri> @allanmiri I just remembered Pitt that one is the best in my opinion for the story.
[0:58:25] <StarlitStunner> Consume bile
[0:58:25] <$realm_forge> I love how dumb zeta is and broken steel should’ve absolutely been in the main game
[0:58:29] <%crimsonharvest> i see its not done
[0:58:30] <dekkitout> "Animal(?)"
[0:58:31] <BliVru> Look man the hentai industry isnt cutting it they need to eat
[0:58:34] <+MisterAvry> would kraken like worm?
[0:58:37] <%RealThiele> what a hero
[0:58:40] <dekkitout> No
[0:58:41] <penitentpendant> Doctor: "Why did you eat your puke the second time?"
[0:58:43] <Profmcstevie> No questions, accept
[0:59:00] <%NovaKnightmare> just eat that guy
[0:59:05] <%ironohki> You're really just moving puke around as needed.
[0:59:06] <%StaceMcGate> sleep in the enertron
[0:59:07] <StarlitStunner> MAP
[0:59:08] <+ThomasOfTroy> This is a big map
[0:59:09] <DraxTD> @PatStaresAt so it's like Chrono Trigger XD
[0:59:10] <%alternative_flu> what is puke if not rehash of what you ate earlier
[0:59:11] <+MisterAvry> Puke Souls
[0:59:14] <$lotharrio> It's a FAllout I guess.
[0:59:16] <%Romuken> go obtain fren
[0:59:16] <DSD24> The Red Sea?
[0:59:17] <Zetheos> it'll get confusinger
[0:59:18] <LoneFonte> ! BIG MAP !
[0:59:18] <allanmiri> The red sea.
[0:59:19] <SaltyDavid> This is the kind of filthy game that WOULD have a catheter bag as a targetable weakpoint
[0:59:20] <RatloreTheIdiot> this really is fallout holy shit
[0:59:21] <Coystick> The description shoukd be flirty like "Animal~"
[0:59:21] <PinionGear> deffinitely animal
[0:59:21] <+Wh0WantsToast> whoa
[0:59:27] <%ironohki> Mario confirmed.
[0:59:28] <%DakotaMacDoodle> fallout 1
[0:59:28] <$lotharrio> Show me that random encounter!
[0:59:33] <cherrycottontail> This is fallout pat
[0:59:33] <Zetheos> yep
[0:59:35] <%GabeSweetMan> OH
[0:59:35] <Ardailec> D: Like Fallout 1
[0:59:36] <penitentpendant> @alternative_flu The lessons dogs try to teach us
[0:59:39] <%MidnightBurst12> gotta recycle
[0:59:39] <LunarRemix> So this is like Fallout
[0:59:43] <LoneFonte> i bet there's some map secrets
[0:59:44] <%GabeSweetMan> Tha's a fallout
[0:59:44] <+Birdigalore> It's that kind of open world where you have no fucking idea where to go and what to do lol
[0:59:45] <Profmcstevie> Like ur an Age of Empires
[0:59:46] <+ThomasOfTroy> Go full offroad to the left
[0:59:49] <+Cobaltor_252> oh yeah this is 100% classic Fallout
[0:59:52] <%BinaryFireball> rebuild america pat
[0:59:55] <%ironohki> Has been discussed very like Fallout.
[0:59:57] <$realm_forge> Ok that’s cool
[1:00:09] <thehullowed> !uptime
[1:00:09] <%GabeSweetMan> The game that I first encountered that type of map/exploration was called "Arcanum".
[1:00:09] <@Moobot> @thehullowed I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 29s.
[1:00:10] <+Wh0WantsToast> Ah yes the #1 tourist spot
[1:00:19] <olm46> Getting such Underrail flashbacks...
[1:00:24] <+MisterAvry> they have little beaver teeth ew
[1:00:31] <%Order_of_Mystery> random question, but does anyone know what keyboard Pat uses?
[1:00:33] <DSD24> Underrail was a cool game
[1:00:33] <%BinaryFireball> guys is it bad that the meat slime looks appetizing? Im starving
[1:00:40] <robosqueeb> how come your mom lets you have TWO meats?
[1:00:46] <%Romuken> yaaaay
[1:00:46] <StarlitStunner> BFF Slime
[1:00:48] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt Do you have a strong attack?
[1:00:50] <Zetheos> fuck yeah friends
[1:00:56] <LunarRemix> Maybe you can take it back to the fleshkraken?
[1:00:56] <%HaroldDonchee> give them to the flesh kraken
[1:00:56] <%BinaryFireball> @robosqueeb so I can have the puddin
[1:00:58] <%StaceMcGate> just like being friends with Pat
[1:00:59] <dekkitout> Attack, my pretties
[1:01:02] <$lotharrio> Was Franz/GermanSpy playing this the other day?
[1:01:03] <+MisterAvry> @BinaryFireball you thinking Arbys?
[1:01:09] <valerios_> @GabeSweetMan Arcanum is a sweet CRPG, gotta save that dog!! m6kwThiccorita
[1:01:11] <%Mendin> Are those big wormy poop-rocks breakable?
[1:01:13] <%BinaryFireball> I am Arby
[1:01:17] <%BinaryFireball> that's my new band name
[1:01:22] <Coda_Anthony> @GabeSweetMan Arcanum was very interesting.  Spent lots of hours on that one
[1:01:23] <%ironohki> @BinaryFireball We have the flesh!
[1:01:34] <notsoy> what are the blue rocks
[1:01:36] <+MisterAvry> no Pat is Arby, he has the MEATS
[1:01:38] <%StaceMcGate> no background music or nothing?
[1:01:40] <%BinaryFireball> also I really hope there is an Arby's in this game
[1:01:40] <SaltyAzteca> Headcrab?
[1:01:46] <RyuuAoi> Ayyyye! Pat! Long time no see! Looking sexier than ever!
[1:01:50] <%StaceMcGate> headcrab zombie
[1:01:50] <%GabeSweetMan> @valerios_ Now only do you want to save the dog, it's optimal because Dog doesn't count as a party member slot!
[1:01:53] <%BinaryFireball> give me a slice a meat kraken plz
[1:01:54] <+zuzuxiv> THE SUN TAKES ANOTHER
[1:01:54] <TheTakkster> time to learn a lesson
[1:01:54] <%GabeSweetMan> *not
[1:01:58] <%RealThiele> it appears to be growing on his face
[1:01:58] <mayormanders> reminds me of oregan trail combat
[1:02:03] <+lordericter> wonder if that was hostile?
[1:02:04] <penitentpendant> Kamikaze attack avoided
[1:02:07] <%Archphronimos> the fuck just happened?
[1:02:17] <+ThomasOfTroy> @GabeSweetMan True, but you can't ride the train with the dog
[1:02:20] <+SpinalWizard> Plenty around
[1:02:25] <%Mendin> much like PeachSaliva, the meat grew swollen
[1:02:26] <theanora1> Pat: Fleshworm Whisperer
[1:02:27] <%DedlokPM> DedlokPM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 55 months! I see we are playing some Grimy Trash today.
[1:02:27] <valerios_> @GabeSweetMan AND the dog is reaaaaaally combat viable, especially early game IIRC
[1:02:32] <%Romuken> trash?
[1:02:35] <%MidnightBurst12> what
[1:02:36] <SaltyDavid> Craft God
[1:02:38] <SaltyAzteca> Thats the spirit
[1:02:39] <%StaceMcGate> craft a goatee trimmer
[1:02:40] <%GabeSweetMan> @ThomasOfTroy I'll live. I was magic anyways.
[1:02:40] <%BinaryFireball> oregan trail combat was you no scoping a buffalo for 2 miles away as you fought off the itis
[1:02:51] <+ThomasOfTroy> @GabeSweetMan Fair
[1:02:52] <+MisterAvry> is this the flesh that hates?
[1:02:55] <%BinaryFireball> cutie <3
[1:02:57] <penitentpendant> Hopefully Meat + Fire = Food is early in the tech tree
[1:02:59] <%StStGold> "Oh boy trash!" is a similar thought  i have when i see you go live
[1:03:03] <%StaceMcGate> it looks like your character is preparing to pee on the slugs
[1:03:09] <%RealThiele> i wonder if this is all just part of flesh kraken
[1:03:09] <%BinaryFireball> this is the flesh that blobs
[1:03:16] <%GabeSweetMan> Arcanum was such a cool setting. It was the inverse of Final Fantasy's magitek in that magic and technology EXPLODE when combined or near one another.
[1:03:16] <%Mendin> GUN
[1:03:19] <RyuuAoi> Get fukt
[1:03:20] <$Faustgesicht> Holy fuck, just got the Candyman trailer. Looks neat
[1:03:23] <%whyskeywolfe> haha gross
[1:03:27] <%alternative_flu> looks like you wormed your way outta this one Pat
[1:03:28] <valerios_> @StStGold gottem LUL
[1:03:39] <PinionGear> I appreciate that animal handling here is just putting animals in your pocket
[1:03:41] <SaltyDavid> did you get xp from that or did the flesh worm steal your xp?
[1:03:47] <+MisterAvry> cast it upon the earth
[1:03:50] <robosqueeb> monkaS
[1:03:51] <Jontman42> enter the flesh Pat
[1:03:53] <allanmiri> Combine them to make a gun-gun.
[1:03:54] <%capnbeefs> Go into the flesh hole
[1:03:58] <+EyeFarted> THE MEAT HOLE
[1:04:01] <%Mendin> Enter The Flesh Caversn
[1:04:02] <%RealThiele> the flesh hole
[1:04:03] <kingmemelord97> get on up in them guts son
[1:04:06] <+lordericter> LUL
[1:04:08] <%GabeSweetMan> Oh man now I wanna start a new Arcanum playthrough and go evil instead.
[1:04:08] <penitentpendant> Game Over YEAAAAH
[1:04:09] <DSD24> The Sun takes Another
[1:04:11] <penitentpendant> Or not
[1:04:11] <dekkitout> The worms, no!
[1:04:13] <SaltyAzteca> Fast reload nice
[1:04:15] <%ChrisPlaysThing> become flesh
[1:04:16] <OtakuSnake1> Now it is you who art the death trash
[1:04:17] <+ThomasOfTroy> Arcanum also let's you fuck a sheep
[1:04:18] <%HaroldDonchee> the flesh worms were set free
[1:04:24] <penitentpendant> Blessed be, fast reload
[1:04:25] <RyuuAoi> Rookie mistake
[1:04:30] <+MisterAvry> ashes to ashes, meat to meat
[1:04:42] <%GabeSweetMan> @ThomasOfTroy Oh no. I never encountered that.
[1:04:42] <Lamrett> ... Is this SCP-001 When Day Breaks the game?
[1:05:06] <penitentpendant> Sneak attacks do seem valuable
[1:05:10] <%RealThiele> no sneak attack at range
[1:05:16] <+MisterAvry> ooh, spells
[1:05:20] <DSD24> Shock!
[1:05:24] <%GabeSweetMan> Well then....
[1:05:24] <SaltyAzteca> Channel your inner Palpatine
[1:05:26] <%HaroldDonchee> dude what
[1:05:27] <allanmiri> Uwa Shock! (or however that's spelled)
[1:05:29] <PinionGear> it is called a backSTAB
[1:05:31] <%GabeSweetMan> It has charges
[1:05:32] <+lordericter> oh it has ammo
[1:05:32] <%Mendin> You Wa SHOCK?
[1:05:33] <olm46> Seems to have limited uses though
[1:05:34] <+MisterAvry> better than puking at fools
[1:05:34] <LunarRemix> But limited use?
[1:05:36] <+SpinalWizard> CHARGES!
[1:05:36] <%Romuken> it's got uses?
[1:05:36] <penitentpendant> Man, you get Sith early
[1:05:38] <+Wh0WantsToast> WTF IS THIS GAME?!
[1:05:45] <%SuckerPunchSyd> UNLIMETED POWER
[1:05:49] <%GabeSweetMan> Those cons are RIDICULOUS
[1:05:50] <%RealThiele> now we bioshock

[1:06:02] <allanmiri> @Wh0WantsToast Death Trash on steam early access.
[1:06:05] <%bravebravesrobin> Very red aesthetic here; also, what's your opinion on the Crunchyroll acquisition? Cheer1000
[1:06:12] <dekkitout> Had to do it to em
[1:06:17] <%Treasure_Vault> How long is the stun compared to the CD?
[1:06:17] <+MisterAvry> 17.99 usd rn
[1:06:24] <%shadowace2400> !uptime
[1:06:24] <@Moobot> @shadowace2400 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 6m.
[1:06:30] <+MisterAvry> I'm thinking about buying it
[1:06:43] <+SpinalWizard> How regen
[1:06:47] <sw_paladin> you have to recharge them in a town
[1:06:56] <%GabeSweetMan> Oh, y'know just some festering.
[1:07:04] <olm46> Eww vancian casting
[1:07:08] <allanmiri> BRAAAINS.
[1:07:15] <%Emperor_Machinus> Just GORE in the Gorge
[1:07:18] <+MisterAvry> mm tomato soup
[1:07:32] <allanmiri> Pour one out for our homie the Tar man.
[1:07:36] <DSD24> Then pay with your blood!
[1:07:44] <%aWanderingKaivo> is he wearing a plague doctor mask?
[1:07:45] <+Wh0WantsToast> @allanmiri Oh I know. I mean this game is constantly confusing me is all.
[1:07:56] <dekkitout> Pay the price in gold or blood
[1:07:57] <TheTakkster> Sick hunter battle
[1:08:02] <%RealThiele> pistol
[1:08:07] <allanmiri> @Wh0WantsToast Oh I see.
[1:08:09] <sw_paladin> pistol is really good
[1:08:10] <%crimsonharvest> wait deconstruct parts for knowledge?
[1:08:13] <allanmiri> Good gun fight Pat.
[1:08:14] <%capnbeefs> Break down old rifle
[1:08:17] <%GabeSweetMan> Yeaaaaah!
[1:08:20] <+MisterAvry> that's it I'm buying this shit
[1:08:28] <+pectusumbra> alright, how much have I missed?
[1:08:36] <penitentpendant> ...wait. How did he read the notes earlier then?
[1:08:50] <%RealThiele> 1-800 ABCDEFG
[1:08:50] <%Mendin> a blip poy?
[1:08:58] <%StStGold> How do you read a boo that teaches you to read?
[1:09:02] <PinionGear> you're illiterate?
[1:09:02] <%GabeSweetMan> Might as well disassemble the extra gun.
[1:09:12] <+Cobaltor_252> OF COURSE
[1:09:21] <Profmcstevie> Take away the unpleasant parts
[1:09:25] <penitentpendant> @StStGold Quickly, apparently
[1:09:27] <SaltyAzteca> Good sound, very crunchy
[1:09:36] <yourliteraldog> Wonder shrooms
[1:09:37] <%Mendin> Ah a blip is an Alluring Skull
[1:09:38] <+ThomasOfTroy> @GabeSweetMan Yeah, if you go to the brothel in the main city, you can straight up ask for something more "unusual". Apparently, the sheep's name is Belle
[1:09:42] <+SpinalWizard> That crafting animation looks like it hurts.
[1:09:43] <+MisterAvry> it sold me just now
[1:09:44] <allanmiri> Time to get high on shrooms
[1:09:54] <+mr_drucifer> looks and sounds like it feels good and that makes me very excited
[1:09:56] <%GabeSweetMan> @ThomasOfTroy LUL
[1:10:06] <yourliteraldog> meat animal
[1:10:08] <%RealThiele> Gorge Gorged
[1:10:10] <allanmiri> I'm glad this game is turning out well. The dude who made it started out by doing pixel art of old fallout games.
[1:10:12] <LunarRemix> It looks like a good alternative for RPGs for the people who can't stand Fallout-style combat
[1:10:14] <%aWanderingKaivo> will they let you back in?
[1:10:16] <Visorak6> I thought they told you that you could never come back?
[1:10:24] <%Order_of_Mystery> is this just fallout with more MEAT?
[1:10:26] <DSD24> Underrail is so hard
[1:10:29] <%alternative_flu> yeah!
[1:10:32] <SaltyAzteca> yeyeyeyeye Underrail
[1:10:38] <stantheman_97> underrail?
[1:10:39] <yourliteraldog> the fuck is that
[1:10:40] <TheTakkster> This is the most sseth game i have ever seen
[1:10:44] <%GabeSweetMan> WHAT?
[1:10:53] <Profmcstevie> Mouse is not a.....immersive way to interact with a world
[1:10:54] <%alternative_flu> The Ascent is like that too it uses wasd movement
[1:10:54] <allanmiri> I bet that blow up at the end damages you.
[1:11:00] <%RealThiele> looks like a flesh turtle is on his face
[1:11:03] <Visorak6> TRASH
[1:11:03] <robosqueeb> it dropped an item
[1:11:04] <%king_wragles> item on the ground
[1:11:06] <%Order_of_Mystery> hey hey people
[1:11:15] <+zuzuxiv> hey hey people
[1:11:16] <allanmiri> OH I hope so.
[1:11:16] <+zuzuxiv> seth here
[1:11:21] <Ardailec> I bet he and Mandalore both do it. At the same time.
[1:11:21] <allanmiri> Sseth is the man.
[1:11:25] <+Nautilus_Bot> Left some items there
[1:11:27] <DSD24> I mean wasteland games are kind of his shtick
[1:11:32] <yourliteraldog> meat mice
[1:11:33] <StarlitStunner> Never forget the value of trash
[1:11:35] <TheFramedWarlock> Hey hey people, Flesh here
[1:11:39] <+PatchTheSquid> but was it death trash?
[1:11:41] <Dunmarkh> He'll probably review it when it's more complete
[1:11:50] <yourliteraldog> retreat
[1:11:50] <krackman245> ResidentSleeper

[1:12:12] <+lordericter> eat pat
[1:12:12] <ZegarWildheart> psaBougie
[1:12:14] <allanmiri> @Ardailec I remember that old joke that Sseth was secretly Mano when he's off his meds or something.
[1:12:15] <%RealThiele> wow that dude is HUGE
[1:12:20] <%aWanderingKaivo> t e n s e

[1:12:44] <allanmiri> Fuck yeah.
[1:12:46] <%RealThiele> magic pixel
[1:12:50] <%capnbeefs> This look real fun
[1:13:12] <%aWanderingKaivo> @crimsonharvest there was a message saying you couldn't do something in combat, I'm guessing he tried
[1:13:25] <%crimsonharvest> oh bummewr
[1:13:37] <yourliteraldog> so cannibalism in this setting normalized
[1:13:53] <penitentpendant> Considering how game breaking that is in some games, it's understandable
[1:13:58] <dukenux> nice to meat you
[1:14:01] <allanmiri> Can't pause the game and spam food and stempacks.
[1:14:14] <yourliteraldog> BRAINS
[1:14:14] <penitentpendant> Flashbacks of eating 60 pieces of cheese in the stopped time
[1:14:17] <DSD24> Wow level 2
[1:14:32] <dekkitout> Empathy for the talky talky
[1:14:33] <DSD24> I like how Empathy is a stat
[1:14:33] <%JoshManVGH> Years of Enter the Gungeon are really paying off here.
[1:14:49] <%Archphronimos> there was a level 2 empathy check at the Fleshkraken guy
[1:14:52] <TheTakkster> Core stats are capped by level
[1:14:52] <yourliteraldog> empathy talk to the fleshkraken care taker
[1:14:55] <SaltyAzteca> Wonder what the level cap is
[1:15:01] <olm46> Melee seems stronger
[1:15:07] <%RealThiele> Vordt build
[1:15:15] <sw_paladin> Melee and stealth are OP
[1:15:23] <%crimsonharvest> dont forget about those green shrubby things
[1:15:24] <dekkitout> Or a stick- with metal spikes
[1:15:29] <yourliteraldog> can you recruit flesh beast?
[1:15:29] <linSP> big unga like the paige
[1:15:33] <%aWanderingKaivo> Vordt hammer best hammer
[1:15:40] <+Nautilus_Bot> Points into horny bonk
[1:15:42] <$realm_forge> Pat will smack all the dudes with his flesh worm
[1:15:44] <SoulxSlayer> Been playing this and I love it. There aren't that many story missions at the moment though unfortunately.
[1:15:47] <+pectusumbra> meat to the left
[1:15:59] <TheTakkster> wall meat missed
[1:16:00] <%crimsonharvest> meat seems abundant
[1:16:01] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @patstaresat you’ve missed several hexenfingers in the zone
[1:16:01] <%TheReallJimbo> this looks a lot like Morbid
[1:16:11] <+Nautilus_Bot> Item you just passed

[1:16:30] <StarlitStunner> SPEED
[1:16:35] <dukenux> the giant gash in the ground
[1:16:36] <%twistedj3ster> searing gas pain land
[1:16:38] <%Order_of_Mystery> you must gather your meat before venturing forth
[1:16:41] <olm46> Free meat if they do
[1:16:56] <SoulxSlayer> There's a town to the east of the area you were just at you need to head to.
[1:18:05] <$Ziegsy> ;;
[1:18:05] <dukenux> fren? :)
[1:18:07] <$Futurecity10> I want to play this but its in early access. How early access

[1:18:36] <%Monkeyweed21> Completionist Pat
[1:18:45] <penitentpendant> It's nice the facility isn't considered part of the city so they don't shoot you upon re-entry

[1:23:17] <allanmiri> You can create your character.
[1:23:25] <RatloreTheIdiot> i like the implication that flesh is no longer considered the default human state
[1:23:26] <allanmiri> Options be limited at the moment though.

[1:40:21] <allanmiri> @yourliteraldog True.
[1:40:48] <$lotharrio> Neat.

[1:41:01] <allanmiri> Bang bang mother fucker.
[1:41:08] <$realm_forge> “I would like to sell this artwork which you bought for nothing” is literally my life

[1:42:23] <mayormanders> energy I think
[1:42:35] <Oxybe> friends are the best currency
[1:42:51] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Do not spend friends like currency
[1:43:34] <+vaderxyz1970> So is this fancier Neo Scavanger?

[1:50:29] <Lieutenant_America> @tourettesplays Splitting hairs at that point.

[1:53:54] <penitentpendant> I think you can 'disenchant' steam cards into 'crystals'?
[1:53:55] <%aWanderingKaivo> time for gamer grime
[1:53:55] <BlueLunecy> But they're worth whole cents
[1:53:57] <%RealThiele> trying to sell those damn cards is a pain in the ass anyways
[1:54:03] <%Emperor_Machinus> Plague of Grimes?
[1:54:19] <dekkitout> Grimes against humanity
[1:54:28] <+pectusumbra> could trade and craft them I suppose, but then you're doing what valve actually wants you to do with them
[1:54:34] <%bassoontyphoon> @patstaresat there’s a “turn cards into gems” function that will get rid of your cards
[1:54:35] <Profmcstevie> Selling cards is pathetically easy, you just go to badge progress then choose to sell everything
[1:54:37] <TourettesPlays> Kinda cool that every trading card has a big desktop background if you click on it

[2:05:40] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Alex Roe did the music sick
[2:05:40] <%holydeviant1> So the lore for this game is legit sad and depressing, for a lot of creatures, that process happens while they are deep inside solid rock

[2:06:43] <akitanito> headbutt parry
[2:06:48] <%crimsonharvest> fall damage?
[2:06:48] <$lotharrio> You absorbed arms.
[2:06:52] <%AncelDeLambert> parrying heals you, and can also give you Castlevania powers if it's the killing blow
[2:06:57] <%RealThiele> im ok with this aesthetic except for the main character LUL
[2:07:01] <a_mad_dragon_> devour-our-our
[2:07:03] <+allups> hit pots

[2:07:44] <%Monkeyweed21> KISS THE ENEMIES FOR HEALTH
[2:07:45] <%ArCielArDor> parrying is life in this game
[2:07:47] <+allups> basically @haitakaa
[2:07:49] <%holydeviant1> Parrying is the ONLY way to get estus without some skills later

[2:08:43] <+rafaelba93> surprise! its dark siuls
[2:08:44] <%holydeviant1> I rec either STR or Dex, but Resonance is important for stronger parry damage later

[2:08:48] <1MadLadd> oh man,  i miss fart gas
[2:08:49] <+rafaelba93> souls

[2:08:55] <$Futurecity10> cheer500 I had a weird beginning experience for FF14. The first week I started 14 I accidently joined a kingdom hearts roleplaying fc and dropped them instantly, only to pick up my now fc who is I think the top Fc on midguardsormr and like 4 members have the saint title for ishgard restoration.  On the third month a was able to buy my current small house in the beds after a fc mate gave me 750k like it was chump change to buy the house, said I didnt have to pay him back but I did after a month.

[2:10:37] <akitanito> was the frail arm a weapon
[2:10:39] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Is there nudity in this game?
[2:10:44] <penitentpendant> "I like how you look, so I'll do things for you without your input."
[2:10:45] <%AgniBrandt> The game REALLY wants you to get in the habit of parrying
[2:11:02] <%coreyyotto> The Devs: You WILL learn to parry
[2:11:05] <akitanito> welp, just gotta keep sucking
[2:11:05] <%AncelDeLambert> you'll get one soon enough

[2:12:13] <+kralec> it looks real good
[2:12:19] <Jontman42> seems dusty
[2:12:20] <%aWanderingKaivo> straight dusty
[2:12:20] <penitentpendant> I mean, practicing mechanics enforces it more than text dumps, historically. So credit there.

[2:12:33] <DSD24> These are some 5 heads
[2:12:34] <+D00msDayDan> i thought this game would look grimier
[2:12:36] <%someyounguy1> quite an accretion of particulate, a mess of dirt, filth in high quantities, almost, grimy
[2:12:40] <%AncelDeLambert> weapon time
[2:12:51] <%AncelDeLambert> strength scale
[2:12:53] <%GabeSweetMan> Well alright then
[2:12:55] <%NateyBeak> I cant beleive this isnt an ACE team game cuz it sure as hell looks like it
[2:12:58] <%Monkeyweed21> This isn't flesh gross, this is dirt gross
[2:12:58] <%holydeviant1> Swings like a sword, heavy is an axe
[2:13:10] <+D00msDayDan> is it a maul or is it an axe? make up your mind!
[2:13:12] <%GabeSweetMan> YO
[2:13:15] <otakon17> did...did it sprout FINGERS?!
[2:13:18] <rekinom> the dark souls of hollow knights of metroidvanias PogChamp
[2:13:22] <%RealThiele> axe g r o w
[2:13:26] <+kralec> yooo, this game looks GOOD
[2:13:29] <$lotharrio> Oh there was probably a breakable wall down a few floors, near the save point
[2:13:32] <%Treasure_Vault> I think there may have been a breakable wall by the shortcut to the bonfire
[2:13:33] <otakon17> axe SPREAD
[2:13:34] <%GabeSweetMan> Shortcut?
[2:13:40] <Visorak6> I think there was a breakable wall at the shortcut you used earlier if you ever go back @PatStaresAt
[2:13:40] <%Romuken> you have weapon, but the question is...should you continue absorbing stuff until that stuff is unlocked?
[2:13:41] <rekinom> 🔥 Bonfire Lit 🔥
[2:13:43] <otakon17> it's a mapping point
[2:13:49] <Dunmarkh> ubisoft towers in my metroidvania?
[2:13:53] <+kralec> "Nervepass".. we ARE in a body...
[2:13:53] <%GabeSweetMan> Cornifex
[2:13:55] <+1semii> 1semii subscribed with Prime. 
[2:13:55] <+ShutUpAceyP> that start point literaly is the same as hollow knight
[2:13:55] <+D00msDayDan> yeah it's totally growing fingers on the heavy attack
[2:13:59] <%Monkeyweed21> ubisoft tower activate
[2:14:01] <%aWanderingKaivo> the zapping.. I mean, mapping system
[2:14:01] <+superchronicc> look at this dead cells lookin' ass protag
[2:14:03] <%AncelDeLambert> throwing weapon
[2:14:03] <+butterick> pupperANGER
[2:14:10] <+kralec> this some crazy body horror stuff
[2:14:17] <otakon17> so Nail is the equivalent of THrowing Daggers
[2:14:28] <+Daedalus119> absorbing enemies is crucial
[2:14:37] <tanarath> Parry BIG good
[2:14:38] <otakon17> it's not THAT gross
[2:14:39] <%aWanderingKaivo> I dunno, its just rocks
[2:14:41] <+kralec> @PatStaresAt would you say it is Grimy?
[2:14:47] <+zuzuxiv> idk if it's nasty, but dirty? yeah
[2:14:47] <otakon17> where's the slime and viscera and mucus?
[2:14:47] <+pectusumbra> and yet it is DRY, just the way Pat likes it
[2:14:49] <DrkJP520> Nasty game for a nasty boy
[2:14:49] <blastazoid00> Is this grime or death trash?
[2:14:51] <penitentpendant> I like the recent set of Metroidvanias that came out. Decent mechanics and art styles.
[2:14:58] <%aWanderingKaivo> Grime
[2:14:59] <otakon17> nom nom nom
[2:15:00] <%RealThiele> this is Grime
[2:15:03] <DSD24> Its a weird contrast that our protag is all cool looking next to all this grime
[2:15:08] <otakon17> om nom nom
[2:15:17] <%Romuken> remember that one horror game that's in 1st person, where the trailer showed you changing out "barrels" for your "gun" and the gun's like a gross bug demon thing?
[2:15:19] <otakon17> THE SPIKES ARE ALIVE
[2:15:24] <%holydeviant1> The unbeatable attack: walking
[2:15:31] <DSD24> @Romuken Was that Scorn?
[2:15:36] <+Daedalus119> @DSD24 it has story significance
[2:15:42] <%aWanderingKaivo> this sassy urn
[2:15:47] <%holydeviant1> It's really funny because their absorb skill is TERRIBLE
[2:15:52] <otakon17> lol was that Pot THROWING you back
[2:15:52] <%Romuken> @DSD24 no idea, kind of fell out of my radar.  I'll go check!
[2:15:56] <penitentpendant> @holydeviant1 The scariest thing fighting game bosses do to you
[2:16:09] <Jontman42> a hoont poont
[2:16:12] <rekinom> A Mike Hunt point
[2:16:12] <otakon17> nom nom nooooooooom
[2:16:12] <akitanito> rock sucked
[2:16:13] <+V3RTIGO_222> pat learns parry
[2:16:14] <%Romuken> @DSD24 YES IT IS Thank you for telling me the name.
[2:16:19] <DrkJP520> Can you cancel a parry attempt by dashing?
[2:16:25] <%Monkeyweed21> PREY HUNT
[2:16:26] <$realm_forge> Would you describe the grime as effluvial?
[2:16:29] <DSD24> @Romuken Glad I could help!
[2:16:32] <%aWanderingKaivo> so absorb is always a kill?
[2:16:36] <%AncelDeLambert> ar-more
[2:16:43] <+kralec> "Skinmaker" this some esoteric shit
[2:16:43] <%holydeviant1> As far as I know armor is all looks
[2:16:46] <DSD24> Oh god not the fall damage
[2:16:50] <otakon17> Absorb does damage it's not always a kill
[2:16:53] <%capnbeefs> Like big rock armor
[2:16:57] <%Romuken> oh, it's set to come out this year, too.  That game's getting back on my radar
[2:17:01] <%aWanderingKaivo> I see
[2:17:02] <akitanito> oh that's a nice reflect
[2:17:04] <otakon17> THAT is sweet
[2:17:06] <+paladinstarbuster> nice
[2:17:08] <%Piemen99> YO
[2:17:20] <DSD24> This is some big brain gameplay
[2:17:29] <%Piemen99> Smart gamer man
[2:17:42] <otakon17> he can't get up!
[2:17:54] <%RealThiele> too heavy LUL
[2:17:56] <otakon17> his head is TOO heavy to move it back up
[2:18:01] <Coystick> "Well we can't do bug souls so I guess....rock souls?"
[2:18:05] <penitentpendant> Use that estus
[2:18:07] <%aWanderingKaivo> I like the mechanic of getting heals from parrying, it makes the risk of failing to parry the first time less painful
[2:18:08] <otakon17> phew that was close
[2:18:20] <penitentpendant> Yeehaw
[2:18:29] <DSD24> Eye's on the inside
[2:18:34] <otakon17> maybe try absorbing closer to get them?
[2:18:34] <%capnbeefs> Yeah this game is a buy for sure
[2:18:38] <%coreyyotto> It's a bomb!
[2:18:45] <dekkitout> What would rock juice be? Mud, I guess...
[2:18:57] <%Romuken> so 2021 is year of the gross
[2:19:04] <otakon17> double daggers GET
[2:19:20] <DSD24> I like these blades
[2:19:20] <%RealThiele> dex bois
[2:19:24] <+paladinstarbuster> oooh
[2:19:56] <Dunmarkh> they're red, you currently can't
[2:19:58] <otakon17> Spike Tacos no good to eat
[2:20:04] <+rafaelba93> i donr think you can absorb them
[2:20:10] <%Romuken> do you have a codex that tells you if you can/can't absorb?
[2:20:40] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt I don't think the game tells you this, but if an enemy's health is brown you can't absorb it
[2:20:52] <%AgniBrandt> Only red health can be absorbed
[2:20:59] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Pant acquired
[2:21:01] <%capnbeefs> Getting big tough now
[2:21:05] <%AgniBrandt> HOWEVER you can still parry
[2:21:16] <i_chevalier> what platform is this?
[2:21:27] <$lotharrio> Weeper hands!
[2:21:29] <%Ne1son> Weeper hands!
[2:21:31] <$lotharrio> Complete the set!
[2:21:31] <%aWanderingKaivo> weeper haaands
[2:21:32] <%AncelDeLambert> got armor
[2:21:34] <+kralec> prickly weeper hands!
[2:21:37] <%Romuken> it's on steam @i_chevalier
[2:21:39] <akitanito> I can't believe they managed to make rock look gross
[2:21:43] <Explodincatz> all the platformers
[2:21:44] <%GabeSweetMan> That's cool.
[2:21:46] <%Piemen99> gross
[2:21:46] <dekkitout> Rocks are like- the least gross things in nature
[2:21:48] <%AgniBrandt> Also, armor is purely cosmetic
[2:21:51] <$lotharrio> Looks dope
[2:21:52] <Skye_Logan> this game looks like everything in it'd make me sneeze
[2:21:55] <%AgniBrandt> So wear what you like
[2:22:08] <%MidnightBurst12> it's the meat squid again
[2:22:16] <i_chevalier> @romuken gotcha thanks
[2:22:21] <%Taisuru> we're watching you to, how come you're never impressed by us like that?
[2:22:25] <%GabeSweetMan> Thank you tutorial-kun.
[2:22:29] <%RealThiele> he had  a non-red attack interesting
[2:22:37] <%Romuken> ok so you can't absorb brown health bars, and can't parry attacks with red glows.
[2:22:40] <%HotSauceFiend> why do the walls have eyes, that horrfyiong
[2:22:56] <%coreyyotto> There's where the Chat Legion goes when the stream is over
[2:22:57] <$lotharrio> The walls are also watching the stream.
[2:23:00] <%Romuken> OOOOH those crawlers have RED spikes to tell you that you cannot absorb
[2:23:08] <%aWanderingKaivo> I dunno why but this is not a game where I'd expect armor to just be cosmetic
[2:23:32] <%someyounguy1> bloodtanite
[2:23:34] <%RealThiele> titanite sounds
[2:23:37] <%Romuken> armor has stats, I'm almost certain
[2:24:07] <+Nautilus_Bot> What’s that smell
[2:24:09] <Dunmarkh> @Romuken armor does not have stats I'm almost certain after my google search
[2:24:15] <DSD24> Some type of grime perhaps
[2:24:16] <%coreyyotto> I like that the arm pot is just flexing
[2:24:17] <%GabeSweetMan> Monch
[2:24:22] <%Romuken> huh, fair enough
[2:24:25] <%ElkRiverDog> Mood, honestly
[2:24:30] <%MidnightBurst12> that's fucked
[2:24:32] <$lotharrio> Can you air dash?
[2:24:33] <%RealThiele> Rock mom was Hoein around with a mud monster
[2:24:47] <Ozavic> Hey Phat and Chat, how is the garbo?
[2:25:16] <%GabeSweetMan> Maybe?
[2:25:19] <penitentpendant> Well it's a metroidvania, so possibly an upgrade in the future
[2:25:27] <%Deft_Thought> Oh god, there are eyes in the walls
[2:25:27] <+kralec> thanks YON!
[2:25:28] <%Deft_Thought> gross
[2:25:48] <%GabeSweetMan> You WILL git gud
[2:25:49] <%AgniBrandt> More mandatory than Sekiro
[2:25:51] <%AgniBrandt> ?
[2:25:54] <DSD24> Can we get cool arms now
[2:25:55] <+Ghufufin> git gud
[2:26:00] <churropoppa> what about the last metroid
[2:26:10] <+pectusumbra> and get more traits from absorbing enemies so it's also working in a shard system as well, looks cool!
[2:26:10] <%GabeSweetMan> git gud or PERISH!
[2:26:16] <%Taisuru> Samus returns had a pretty mandatory parry
[2:26:28] <%Ne1son> Secret Doors
[2:26:36] <%Romuken> So it passively reveals hidden doors?
[2:26:38] <Sigma_190_Beta> Frantic seems important.
[2:26:41] <%Romuken> ^^
[2:26:42] <Visorak6> that sounds good for BLIND
[2:26:42] <tanarath> hmmm
[2:26:45] <Sigma_190_Beta> If you get secrets right?
[2:26:51] <$lotharrio> So wait, slow walk, paths, better counters and... stamina counters?
[2:26:51] <tanarath> Anti blind ability
[2:26:55] <DSD24> Aww yeah cool arms
[2:26:58] <+kralec> oh, these are permanent upgradeds...
[2:27:08] <%AgniBrandt> AgniBrandt subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 10 month streak! Since Twitch is telling me to talk again, I figured I'd note that you talking about Cinders got me to play it again! I'm having a lot of fun with fist weapons and their bullshit roundhouse kicks.
[2:27:10] <%StStGold> why is walking slowly an upgrade?
[2:27:26] <penitentpendant> @StStGold Stealth mechanics perhaps?
[2:27:31] <%holydeviant1> @StStGold Hazard areas, I think? I've yet to find a use
[2:27:33] <+Ghufufin> maybe its a swagger walk?
[2:27:36] <Sigma_190_Beta> Missed a path down there.
[2:27:53] <+pectusumbra> magic pixel
[2:27:54] <%holydeviant1> Hollow knight repop
[2:27:59] <%Piemen99> Ah yes Pats ancient enemy spikes
[2:28:00] <akitanito> man, the heal is really slow
[2:28:06] <@Fuggins4U> Fuggins4U subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! I lub pat
[2:28:17] <%aWanderingKaivo> can you absorb spikes :P
[2:28:26] <Visorak6> At least spikes arent 1HKO
[2:28:27] <%someyounguy1> are spikes the enemy of civilization? even all the way to megaman theyve been against us
[2:28:34] <$lotharrio> One time, Pat saw a spike dying on the side of the road. He didn't even stop his velocipede to check if it was okay.
[2:28:34] <Sigma_190_Beta> Huh... I guess I was wrong.
[2:28:35] <%holydeviant1> Hint: you can dash as long as you have force
[2:28:38] <Sigma_190_Beta> Sorry about that.
[2:28:43] <%Dakuu75> doodShake
[2:28:56] <%holydeviant1> tthere's no cooldown on dashing, is what I mean
[2:29:21] <DSD24> Man this world sucks there's all these arms trying to cold cock you
[2:29:25] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt Cool thing about the map in this game that took me a while to notice--it tries to give you hints about secrets. If a you see a soft fade instead of a hard outline; you've missed a path
[2:29:41] <%Piemen99> Hey there were hands in that background wall
[2:30:04] <Ozavic> Old school RPG tech, good shit!
[2:30:27] <Ozavic> I remember looking for 'soft walls' in Baulder
[2:30:30] <%Romuken> bloodmetal...wait, isn't that iron/
[2:30:33] <Ozavic> 's gate for the ps2
[2:30:40] <%Dakuu75> It shows promis
[2:30:43] <%Monkeyweed21> is this the Dark Souls of Hollow Knight?
[2:30:46] <Bladeexe> So this is dead cells but 3D?
[2:30:53] <Bladeexe> or 2.5D?
[2:30:54] <%Piemen99> What other game did Pat play tonight?
[2:31:09] <Visorak6> Is Grime early access too?
[2:31:19] <Dunmarkh> this is edgy kirby
[2:31:22] <%aWanderingKaivo> protagonist visuals reminded me immediately of dead cells though
[2:31:28] <penitentpendant> Has the bung come?
[2:31:30] <%holydeviant1> fuckin love the bellow mace
[2:31:33] <penitentpendant> *Bunga
[2:31:35] <%holydeviant1> it screams
[2:31:38] <$lotharrio> That's a strength weapon
[2:31:40] <%Romuken> read that description it's so gross
[2:31:42] <%aWanderingKaivo> edgy kirby, perfect
[2:31:43] <+MushyCornbread> the big bonk
[2:31:47] <%HaroldDonchee> that's pretty metal
[2:31:48] <%Ne1son> It Bellows
[2:31:49] <%Piemen99> BIG AND STRONG
[2:32:02] <%Monkeyweed21> This is the Sekiro of Salt and Sanctuary
[2:32:16] <scrumbotime> it yells when you do two hit combo
[2:32:23] <penitentpendant> @Monkeyweed21 Fair
[2:32:45] <+DeadlyPeaks> Is this on Switch? Looks pretty good
[2:32:47] <%scaryboisupreme> big strong fuck
[2:33:16] <%holydeviant1> he defen, he attac, but most importantly he SCREM
[2:33:26] <$lotharrio> Level goals.
[2:33:34] <%aWanderingKaivo> are there plunging attacks at all?
[2:33:56] <%Romuken> psaBougie
[2:33:59] <Coystick> Oh hey it's Trusty Pebbles
[2:34:09] <$lotharrio> Pat, murdering uglies just like in real life.

[2:34:12] <+pectusumbra> might want to save?
[2:34:18] <%aWanderingKaivo> killing these poor hollows
[2:34:20] <LadyAmatsu> Yes there are plunging attacks
[2:34:24] <%Ne1son> COWARD

[2:34:34] <penitentpendant> That pre-boss level up
[2:34:40] <%holydeviant1> shortcut~
[2:34:46] <$lotharrio> What's resonance do?
[2:34:47] <penitentpendant> It's nice it didn't lock you in the arena
[2:34:50] <LadyAmatsu> This is a pretty neat game. Hope you enjoy it shedAYAYA
[2:35:02] <$lotharrio> Interesting...
[2:35:04] <%holydeviant1> @lotharrio Weird shit. Boosts parry damage
[2:35:11] <+pectusumbra> that trait you picked up that does damage on repel uses resonance
[2:35:23] <%aWanderingKaivo> that stamina sweet spot
[2:35:24] <$lotharrio> I fought that guy in Slay the Spire.
[2:35:27] <+pectusumbra> oh hey it's that guy from Slay the Spire
[2:35:27] <%holydeviant1> The biggest, ugliest face.

[2:36:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> just win Pat
[2:36:32] <%ArCielArDor> absorb
[2:36:44] <$lotharrio> Looks like one of the pushes can be absorbed.
[2:36:48] <Visorak6> Well they got the dark souls music down for sure
[2:36:49] <%coreyyotto> the mace probably isn't the way
[2:36:55] <%BlackStarAura> Twist its dick
[2:36:55] <%holydeviant1> The weird thing is the death mechanic isn't even for souls, its for your soul-gain scaling
[2:37:00] <%holydeviant1> which you get from this boss
[2:37:00] <%ArCielArDor> also there's a lull in between shield bashes you can dash through
[2:37:01] <LadyAmatsu> You can dash through attacks
[2:37:02] <Dunmarkh> you cultivated it, you keep it
[2:37:03] <%MidnightBurst12> rock souls

[2:38:57] <penitentpendant> The Black Hole Head is making me think of that old game "OFF"
[2:38:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> Are you a living blackhole?
[2:39:03] <%capnbeefs> Ehanced SUCC
[2:39:07] <Sigma_190_Beta> STYLE METER.
[2:39:09] <%coreyyotto> DS1 Humanity, basically?
[2:39:13] <%holydeviant1> Ardor is what you ddrop when you die, btw
[2:39:15] <+Daedalus119> @Visorak6 why would you need a shield when you've got a good dodge and counters
[2:39:35] <%HaroldDonchee> dude you get a fan club? that's rad
[2:39:44] <churropoppa> these things talk like minions
[2:39:46] <%YakumoYomi> Where the Rockbiter, tho?
[2:39:51] <%aWanderingKaivo> From Lordran, to Lothric, to Lithic LUL
[2:39:51] <$lotharrio> Morph ball?
[2:39:55] <%Romuken> arm maybe
[2:39:55] <+paladinstarbuster> The Chiseled one is such a baller  name
[2:40:02] <%Piemen99> These teases
[2:40:03] <%Monkeyweed21> must get smoll
[2:40:05] <+ghostfaceninja_> anyone member the rock biter?
[2:40:13] <%hewlettfan96> What a game
[2:40:18] <%BlackStarAura> Those gourmet rocks
[2:40:18] <+Nautilus_Bot> Morph ball
[2:40:18] <ChungusQuest> ooh, fall damage
[2:40:21] <%coreyyotto> Grimey can't crawl
[2:40:36] <$lotharrio> I'm seeing Morphball, double dash... maybe air dash, so far.
[2:40:40] <%Piemen99> how dare they just leave a ungettable item in front of progess
[2:40:49] <%capnbeefs> OH that's cool
[2:40:52] <%cade_calrayn> oh wow
[2:40:54] <%Piemen99> It's like they know im a loot goblin
[2:40:58] <%cade_calrayn> okay then
[2:40:58] <%coreyyotto> shit's fucked
[2:41:11] <Dunmarkh> oh
[2:41:14] <%Piemen99> OH
[2:41:15] <%holydeviant1> When life touched this planet, it *went to the wrong place* and now all the rocks are weird and half-alive
[2:41:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> Rockula?
[2:41:17] <Manwad> monkaS
[2:41:18] <Dunmarkh> big map
[2:41:20] <Sigma_190_Beta> Oh, your mass is being taken from you?
[2:41:24] <Visorak6> @Visorak6 because you literally absorbed the boss's shield arms, I figured itd give you a shield ability
[2:41:25] <Link232> Gotta get to the Qilpoth and fight rock Vergil
[2:41:33] <%solracc25> that's some good rock
[2:41:34] <%stickygumbolee> PRAISE THE IGNEOUS
[2:41:44] <%Piemen99> Oh cool
[2:41:59] <Manwad> oh, so you don't lose mass but you lose your multiplier
[2:42:07] <%Piemen99> Dex for big hammer?
[2:42:10] <Sigma_190_Beta> Did your model change?
[2:42:31] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> welcome to the catacombs?
[2:42:31] <+kralec> So your incentivized to play well, but not punished if you fail a lot. Hmm. rooThink
[2:42:32] <+ALazo> ping 'Grimy Abomination'
[2:42:33] <Sigma_190_Beta> Also I think your hammer scales with dex.
[2:42:33] <%capnbeefs> I like all this big rock stuff, is this on consoles
[2:42:42] <+paladinstarbuster> @Sigma_190_Beta he's gaining mass
[2:43:05] <%aWanderingKaivo> cultivating mass, one might say
[2:43:12] <%Romuken> he came at you SO HARD
[2:43:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt you did ask for it
[2:43:19] <robosqueeb> fuck around and found out
[2:43:23] <Coystick> At Status: Cummed
[2:43:23] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> he came at him
[2:43:32] <valriot> LUL
[2:43:35] <%stickygumbolee> Got cummed
[2:43:36] <%aWanderingKaivo> "come at me bro" - man came at
[2:43:37] <Sigma_190_Beta> Fall damage.
[2:43:37] <Dunmarkh> FALL DAMAGE
[2:43:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt SMACK
[2:43:41] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> LOL
[2:43:52] <%stickygumbolee> cum around and find out
[2:43:52] <penitentpendant> Oof, fall damage sucks in these games
[2:43:52] <+kralec> Fall damage
[2:43:53] <%Piemen99> well yeah you're a rock
[2:43:55] <%RonaldMcDownload> Wow, this looks super bad.
[2:43:56] <Dunmarkh> nice quick respawn tbh
[2:44:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> New PREY found
[2:44:41] <%aWanderingKaivo> look at this fuckin twinblade
[2:45:02] <Visorak6> Its the weapon hes using
[2:45:05] <chrishansen69_> it ruined him
[2:45:06] <%holydeviant1> Yr give ZERO fucks
[2:45:17] <Happy_Acciden> is it strength and 5 dex or either one of the 2
[2:45:25] <penitentpendant> Yeah, one hit kill is generally the 'go do something else for a while' from minibosses
[2:45:34] <SovPho> look at this DUDE
[2:45:44] <+Nautilus_Bot> Cool, it has brown and red health to give it different phases
[2:46:04] <valriot> BIG SUCC
[2:46:15] <%aWanderingKaivo> an ardorous ordeal
[2:46:16] <Sigma_190_Beta> BIG STYLE NUMBER.
[2:46:22] <SovPho> cool backgrounds
[2:46:34] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> YOU'RE a GRIME doodBait doodBait doodBait
[2:46:37] <Sigma_190_Beta> If your Ardor goes below a number you are a scrub :)
[2:46:38] <3viltiki> Heya Pat! Whatcha playin?
[2:46:52] <valriot> No Simpy of the Night
[2:46:56] <$lotharrio> Didn't even lose the ardor.
[2:47:09] <$lotharrio> Red though
[2:47:11] <+pectusumbra> aria or order of eccelsia/bloodstained
[2:47:12] <akitanito> why did you just tank that
[2:47:18] <jumpyhugs> it... it's in the title
[2:47:21] <chrishansen69_> Ohooohow!  fossil fist strikes again!
[2:47:24] <%Ne1son> Yeah
[2:47:28] <$lotharrio> You... might have?
[2:47:29] <Sigma_190_Beta> A bit.
[2:47:31] <+ThomasOfTroy> No
[2:47:34] <+kralec> Yeah. I really loved those games to. I’m going to pick this shit up first chance tomorrow.
[2:47:35] <Visorak6> chozo statue?
[2:47:37] <akitanito> have you?
[2:47:37] <%coreyyotto> you played the demo i think
[2:47:38] <+pectusumbra> I believe a very short time but then said it was for you by yourself
[2:47:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> Yeah, a bit
[2:47:39] <borkmire> yeah but never finished
[2:47:40] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> i think so
[2:47:40] <+RenoDeGeneric> Bloodstained good
[2:47:40] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Kinda
[2:47:43] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt You did one stream then decided you wanted to play it on your own.
[2:47:44] <+Daedalus119> you'll find out about that later
[2:47:45] <%holydeviant1> I never knew that was there! Shit!
[2:47:46] <Sigma_190_Beta> Fast Travel?
[2:47:47] <penitentpendant> Can't talk to the rib cage yet, apparently
[2:47:49] <%SuckerPunchSyd> You played a bit of it
[2:47:50] <Mattais88> Who cares, do it again
[2:47:52] <%holydeviant1> that's IMPORTANT
[2:47:53] <Sigma_190_Beta> Is that Fast Travel?
[2:47:56] <ChungusQuest> looks like a fast travel, maybe? Nidus Canal?
[2:48:11] <%Monkeyweed21> Did you ever get to Invert? cuz Invert is the shit in Bloodstained
[2:48:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> My family
[2:48:33] <%holydeviant1> Yeah, the true armor in the game is consumable
[2:48:37] <ChungusQuest> FANGDOG
[2:48:40] <$lotharrio> You sure THAT is the weirdest thing about this game?
[2:48:45] <a_mad_dragon_> rock zangief
[2:48:50] <+senfood> ok but that bacckgroud tho
[2:48:54] <chrishansen69_> ReallyBigRocks, they were put to good use. rest easy!
[2:49:04] <lemon_lover28> kinda look like the dead cells character
[2:49:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> reminds me of Kenshi
[2:49:26] <geoffster999> i know its only like 28 bucks but is it worth the buy
[2:49:26] <Admiral_PopnFresh> visually
[2:49:30] <Coystick> More like, Head Cells.
[2:49:39] <Visorak6> frankly I'd rather have a singularity for a head than whatever freakazoid shit these things have
[2:49:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> the swing animation is kinda similar too
[2:49:50] <RyeBreadBakery> rock heads.....
[2:49:50] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I'm really digging this earthly aesthetic
[2:49:53] <%capnbeefs> That background is fucking stellar
[2:49:56] <$lotharrio> Wait was that you?
[2:50:02] <chrishansen69_> dead cell is cool.. beats beauty and the beast.. and even cobra
[2:50:13] <+pectusumbra> sure did. means some will attack you I bet
[2:50:13] <%Romuken> nope
[2:50:17] <%Tman451> Mimic maybe?
[2:50:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> That one was extra grimy
[2:50:30] <%Piemen99> that was weird
[2:50:31] <chrishansen69_> Romuken, why not?
[2:50:31] <+kralec> Yeah monkaS
[2:50:49] <%WhereIsWill> WhereIsWill subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! 2 years that crazy. Also, did you know that you'd triple your audience if you stepped up your emote game? It's true, with science! anyways, keep on keepin on!
[2:50:55] <%Romuken> @chrishansen69_ I meant i didnt see the health bar @.@
[2:51:01] <Happy_Acciden> those explodey things have red hp bars, I'd assume they have a counterable attack
[2:51:02] <$Ziegsy> hairy rock
[2:51:02] <Dunmarkh> a friend?
[2:51:09] <%Monkeyweed21> HANDS
[2:51:30] <chrishansen69_> Romuken, ah yeah, me neither. I understand
[2:51:33] <+MushyCornbread> wouldnt be a sidescroller without spike traps coming out of the ground
[2:51:44] <$lotharrio> Yeah, getting those gains!
[2:51:46] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Damn, this game rocks
[2:51:57] <%Treuan> become lorge
[2:51:59] <%Piemen99> Big and strong
[2:52:03] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Kappa
[2:52:06] <akitanito> booo
[2:52:13] <%zeroarturia> Booooo!
[2:52:13] <%Piemen99> booooo
[2:52:14] <%shurtal> boo-urns
[2:52:14] <Finakala> I dunno, I admire the stones to make that joke
[2:52:15] <%YakumoYomi> LUL
[2:52:15] <$lotharrio> I think you mean boo-ulder.
[2:52:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> This game is groundbreaking
[2:52:18] <ChungusQuest> booo-urns
[2:52:18] <%emperordread> Boo-urns
[2:52:19] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Your boos only make me stronger
[2:52:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> Again you guys, the rock jokes are my thing. Stop stealing my brand
[2:52:20] <%ArCielArDor> sadly those are all just skins
[2:52:30] <chrishansen69_> punch the boulder!
[2:52:31] <%MechArch> that's stoned cold pat
[2:52:31] <%emperordread> @shurtal hivemind
[2:52:34] <penitentpendant> @wizard_of_diamonds I share that sediment
[2:52:36] <%ArCielArDor> it's just fashion souls
[2:52:44] <%HaroldDonchee> puzzle shit
[2:52:47] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Nice
[2:52:48] <peyodogo> redistribute the rock jokes
[2:52:54] <%holydeviant1> It's a lower jaw that throws its eyes at you!
[2:52:57] <Finakala> Gravel before the big lad
[2:52:58] <+pectusumbra> yeah where's Redfield when we need him?
[2:53:00] <+rafaelba93> parry that shit
[2:53:03] <Manwad> it's that terrifying dali thing!
[2:53:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> I've built this brand for decades, all for this moment
[2:53:19] <chrishansen69_> peyodogo dont you downplay that one
[2:53:28] <%DakotaMacDoodle> This game has pretty Solid Geopolitical arguments
[2:53:38] <+kralec> @patstaresat should probably spend your mass.
[2:53:46] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Yoooo
[2:53:50] <%shurtal> @emperordread we know all the references
[2:53:51] <ChungusQuest> ^I share that sediment
[2:53:52] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Just noticed the hands in the background
[2:53:54] <Happy_Acciden> pat stop taking chat's puns for granite
[2:53:58] <robosqueeb> reminds me of the ren n stimpy teeth nerves he plucks out
[2:53:59] <%aWanderingKaivo> this is a gneiss game
[2:54:06] <peyodogo> sipsipDab
[2:54:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> ericbLeft chat pls ericbRight
[2:54:31] <robosqueeb> does this game have combat or is it just feldsparring?
[2:54:36] <%shurtal> @ChungusQuest ngl, I chuckled
[2:54:39] <3viltiki> This game is kinda like if Hollow Knight had a titanite based curse backstory is what methinks
[2:54:57] <+wizard_of_diamonds> NICE
[2:55:04] <$lotharrio> HUNT COMPLETE
[2:55:08] <%holydeviant1> NICE that absorb is a bit hard
[2:55:12] <$realm_forge> The visual style reminds me of that one shooter that’s been in development forever that’s all twisted and based heavily in H.R Geiger’s designs
[2:55:13] <%capnbeefs> So many hands
[2:55:14] <chrishansen69_> emperordread has been dead for centuries it seems.. who are you refering to?
[2:55:28] <%holydeviant1> Because his melee is a two-step, it gets unblockable in the second half
[2:55:31] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Fine no more puns you made it Crystal clear.
[2:55:43] <%Piemen99> booooooooooo
[2:55:48] <%CzeekyTV> This game just makes me feel "People should rip good ideas and artstyles off good games to make more good games more"
[2:55:49] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @realm_forge Scorn? How so rofl
[2:55:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> This is the best parry
[2:55:58] <%Piemen99> 69 nice
[2:56:15] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[2:56:15] <Parapattern> LUL
[2:56:16] <Goatllama> LUL
[2:56:17] <%YakumoYomi> NotLikeThis
[2:56:17] <+pectusumbra> OOF
[2:56:19] <robosqueeb> you  did it
[2:56:19] <%holydeviant1> Perfectly set up trap
[2:56:19] <%slimmixrp> LOL
[2:56:20] <Visorak6> LUL
[2:56:21] <%capnbeefs> Nice work
[2:56:22] <Dunmarkh> NotLikeThis
[2:56:22] <$lotharrio> I liked the refusal to adopt.
[2:56:23] <kazadaz> Hmm interessting
[2:56:24] <%Piemen99> LUL
[2:56:24] <+pectusumbra> well can spend your points!
[2:56:27] <%Taisuru> LUL
[2:56:28] <ChungusQuest> your head a splode
[2:56:29] <Visorak6> You own goblins killed you
[2:56:30] <+pectusumbra> see the new traits you got
[2:56:30] <notsoy> gonna need an airdash
[2:56:30] <penitentpendant> Explosive Barrels won again
[2:56:34] <Goatllama> get spik't
[2:56:36] <%Mister_McDerp> LUL
[2:56:43] <Dunmarkh> don't make me quote far cry 3 man
[2:56:50] <+kralec> Ball exposed on streqm LUL
[2:56:50] <kazadaz> I would simply not headbut the bombs
[2:56:52] <chrishansen69_> well yeah.. there's your weird
[2:56:58] <Happy_Acciden> off to a rocky start with the explodey guys huh
[2:56:59] <%holydeviant1> Might wanna check yo traits in there
[2:57:02] <$lotharrio> You got hunt points, right?
[2:57:08] <+pectusumbra> check the new traits! What did that fangdog give you?
[2:57:13] <Goatllama> waht is this yugioh monster
[2:57:15] <%DakotaMacDoodle> This game looks great but I think I'll wait for it to go on shale. Alright that was the last one
[2:57:15] <velosiraptorrexman> Wat is this goomba game? A rogueloke w0tever
[2:57:20] <Visorak6> To be fair investing in both means you can try out more shit
[2:57:38] <$realm_forge> @wizard_of_diamonds a lot of the repeated biological looking patterns in the environment and I think one of the demo videos had the same kind of freaky ambient music
[2:57:43] <KahnWick> Why does the MC look like a tumor?
[2:58:03] <Goatllama> it is NOT A TUMA
[2:58:17] <$lotharrio> Kill one guy.
[2:58:29] <chrishansen69_> Goatllama. double l is a freak of spelling.. luckily nature likes you
[2:58:38] <$lotharrio> Also, ardor isn't lost, right?
[2:58:40] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Damn, I love this aesthetic sooo much. Earth-centered looks are underrepresented. I want it just because it looks so fucking cool
[2:58:44] <$lotharrio> On death, I mean.
[2:58:46] <%Romuken> LIL MAC
[2:58:49] <brovietto> we got HULK HANDS
[2:58:49] <Parapattern> Rocks gonna catch these hands
[2:58:53] <+rafaelba93> those handa rules
[2:58:54] <Mirrorcatch> look at these hulk fists, amazing
[2:58:54] <%holydeviant1> Now you look like dollar store Vectorman
[2:59:14] <MidnightPacif1c> bandit briiinger
[2:59:14] <SovPho> budget cosplay
[2:59:16] <+RenoDeGeneric> Now you made me miss Vectorman...
[2:59:18] <%aWanderingKaivo> that's a good heavy
[2:59:21] <%WhereIsWill> bring back vectorman tho!
[2:59:24] <Goatllama> this is Gucci Vectorman
[2:59:38] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @PatStaresAt You know what those nerve things remind me of? Shara Isvhalda from MHW
[2:59:38] <+pectusumbra> man woolie would love this. Super weird, parry focused, and super early punch weapon
[2:59:46] <+OboTolken> Pro-tip, if I'm allowed to give it, try not to allocate your levels evenly across the 3 stats. Late-game items want you to all-in on one or two of the stats
[2:59:49] <%holydeviant1> @WhereIsWill unironically yes
[2:59:58] <%HaroldDonchee> the constant parry stuff makes the combat look kinda weird sometimes
[3:00:05] <%MittensBroadcast> we playing vector man
[3:00:07] <%aWanderingKaivo> and the succ
[3:00:08] <SovPho> he likes to shout at them
[3:00:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> His screen names are always SHOUT OF THE EARTH
[3:00:16] <chrishansen69_> pectusumbra, woolie wouldnt know how to raise a shield
[3:00:17] <rekinom> Recommend it to woolie so he can try it in 3-5 years when he forgets you mentioned it and thinks it's his idea
[3:00:18] <+tempestzephyr> ShoutofEarth
[3:00:20] <%vitoxxi> will there be a podcast next week?
[3:00:22] <+D00msDayDan> and parries
[3:00:32] <$lotharrio> Woolie once gave up a 3v3 Marvel tournament against Daigo to play with rocks.
[3:00:36] <+D00msDayDan> @rekinom LUL
[3:00:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> all podcasts are cancelled forever
[3:00:46] <awfully_crispy> Man I'm really happy for Woolie
[3:00:47] <%vitoxxi> oh nice
[3:00:51] <%Arweynn> the break?
[3:00:56] <%TheWinged7> wait break? i havent listedn to it yet
[3:00:57] <awfully_crispy> Getting honeymoon, finishing his tat
[3:01:01] <%Tman451> I missed the last podcast, theres a break?
[3:01:02] <Goatllama> @lotharrio LUL
[3:01:02] <penitentpendant> @rekinom You're not wrong
[3:01:04] <anAngryHamster> Woolie will play thin 8 years right after Arkham City
[3:01:04] <%holydeviant1> The only bad part of the game is that it's really easy to get overwhelmed because of how multiple attacks and the parry work
[3:01:07] <Visorak6> Do the Giefcast while woolie's gone
[3:01:10] <%RealThiele> reggie and pat talk about sports they know nothing aboutcast
[3:01:13] <+RenoDeGeneric> Caught the backdash
[3:01:25] <%Broand> are you griman son?
[3:01:35] <+reknownblackcat> Calcium Souls
[3:01:35] <%Taisuru> Reggie and pat cast please
[3:01:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> Gief cast has too much high quality conversations
[3:01:46] <+vicar_anat> A chance for Pat, Captain of Grime, to show his quality!
[3:01:50] <$lotharrio> It's the most efficient grind.
[3:01:51] <chrishansen69_> holydeviant1, you just decribed 99% of ds2 playthrough
[3:01:53] <a_mad_dragon_> commiting grimes
[3:01:57] <Visorak6> Half of it I think
[3:02:06] <rekinom> the podcast between woolie/pat/paige was a fun one
[3:02:07] <%ABakedDemon> ABakedDemon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 
[3:02:09] <$lotharrio> Griminal intent.
[3:02:17] <+DrPoxx> Dont be such a Grime Baby?
[3:02:35] <%holydeviant1> @chrishansen69_ Like, I mean that you will hit the parry for one dude and the next attack will knoc you out of it right before it 'goes off'
[3:02:36] <+rafaelba93> i like that you dont lose your "souls"
[3:02:38] <%aWanderingKaivo> the hard grimes
[3:02:46] <+FoolsArcade> Pat you're rivaling Paige with these falls
[3:03:13] <+MisterAvry> man whoever invented having little bits of experience fly toward the player was a genius
[3:03:14] <chrishansen69_> holydeviant1, that seems unfair.
[3:03:15] <%Broand> Looks like a metroidvania,
[3:03:20] <$lotharrio> The most big strong boy.
[3:03:40] <%ImFlippinOut> ImFlippinOut subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! Been a fan since Kirby Epic Yarn, Does that make me a stalker?
[3:03:44] <%holydeviant1> @chrishansen69_ eh, just don't get surrounded and learn to seperate enemies, but yeah, it's a bit of a bitch
[3:03:45] <+DrPoxx> all those hands
[3:03:46] <%HaroldDonchee> looks like a root boy
[3:03:47] <+tempestzephyr> you love it
[3:03:47] <penitentpendant> It looks like an NPC, ironically
[3:03:49] <$Ziegsy> i want to lick the pink stone
[3:03:51] <+DrPoxx> just want to touch
[3:03:53] <%vitoxxi> punch the bonfire
[3:03:58] <+Havictos> So is this place just infinite rock?
[3:04:02] <+FoolsArcade> @MisterAvry Jak and Daxter with Eco was always super satisfying too lol
[3:04:08] <psimon_> what dos argore do?
[3:04:32] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Hur hur, he looks like a bellend

[3:04:56] <+rafaelba93> buy all his shit now
[3:04:57] <%arcaderabbit48> All become crab
[3:04:57] <$realm_forge> All the monsters have the same energy as the toothbrushing episode of Ren and Stimpy
[3:04:58] <Manwad> accelerate to CRAB
[3:05:04] <+rafaelba93> he dissapeared for me
[3:05:10] <%holydeviant1> @Havictos Life meant to go to biological organisms hit rocks instead, and this is what happened
[3:05:17] <%doomunderthestairs> claw looks cool
[3:05:21] <%RealThiele> farm for crab
[3:05:26] <$Ziegsy> WELL DONE PAT, was that big enough?
[3:05:38] <$lotharrio> Yeah but it's got a thriving art scene and night life.
[3:05:43] <chrishansen69_> holydeviant1, its the dark souls motto! pokemon taught me to be below avarage and expect the most, dark souls taught me to be excellent and deserve criticism.
[3:05:46] <%holydeviant1> There's a community that has to *mine for more members*
[3:05:50] <+pectusumbra> what do those splinters DO?
[3:06:12] <carrion_king_> and dex?
[3:06:13] <+pectusumbra> got ya
[3:06:13] <%RealThiele> Downthrust eventually?
[3:06:18] <+thehollow89> what did Pat think of Death Trash?
[3:06:18] <%Broand> fightanite
[3:06:32] <%arcaderabbit48> Boo
[3:06:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> GRAVITY SUCKS
[3:06:42] <+wizard_of_diamonds> NICE
[3:06:43] <$lotharrio> @thehollow89 Big fan, will wait till its fully, properly out.
[3:06:47] <%vitoxxi> why does it say infinite over there?
[3:06:48] <%Broand> feeling a little disarming at the state of gravity
[3:06:49] <+Havictos> @holydeviant1 I can genuinely say I've never seen this kind of aesthetic that's for sure
[3:06:50] <%holydeviant1> TEXTBOOK
[3:06:58] <+pectusumbra> in a game of single digit stats, each point would mean a lot, yeah
[3:07:01] <$lotharrio> Ardor is at infinite. I repeat. INFINITE ARDOR
[3:07:02] <%RealThiele> become c r a b
[3:07:24] <%RealThiele> ROCK INFINITELY MAD
[3:07:49] <+pectusumbra> resonence weapon?
[3:07:53] <+Daedalus119> lanterns are weird
[3:07:55] <$lotharrio> It said it applies stacks.
[3:08:01] <+Daedalus119> yeah it's a resonance weapon
[3:08:02] <+MisterAvry> utility?
[3:08:10] <%MelBrooksKA> "This is kinda upsetting" he said, kind of upset
[3:08:14] <+thelonechris> Pat's having flashbacks to Ori
[3:08:16] <akitanito> big scurred
[3:08:19] <%holydeviant1> slap on stacks with weak attack, detonate with strong
[3:08:22] <Manwad> too spooky
[3:08:22] <%Piemen99> do it coward
[3:08:23] <%Broand> gloomnest, a nest that is deep
[3:08:36] <skagtheprinceofhell> Is he even doing damage to that thing?
[3:08:43] <chrishansen69_> you cant go there pat..
[3:08:53] <%holydeviant1> @skagtheprinceofhell resonance weapons are weird.
[3:08:58] <Coystick> Why rocks gotta be gross?
[3:09:01] <+pectusumbra> it's that same one from the first area
[3:09:04] <%RealThiele> parry or gtfo it seems
[3:09:09] <%Romuken> thought the lantern sucked.  NOPE.  thing just has a bazillion hp
[3:09:11] <+wizard_of_diamonds> First try!
[3:09:12] <$Ziegsy> A W Y E A H
[3:09:22] <skagtheprinceofhell> Parry did do more damage yes
[3:09:24] <+Havictos> @holydeviant1 So I get the premise why is everything fucked up though?
[3:09:31] <%Broand> You don't freak in this freak world!
[3:09:33] <Dunmarkh> DIE FREAK, YOU DON'T BELONG IN THIS WORLD
[3:09:33] <$lotharrio> Gotta break that bomb.
[3:09:38] <penitentpendant> Looks like a checkpoint hallway, all external back to this point
[3:09:40] <skagtheprinceofhell> Does the weapon give him that execute window?
[3:09:43] <%HaroldDonchee> use explosivos
[3:09:49] <%Broand> Maybe burst lantern?
[3:09:55] <penitentpendant> Unless he has a ranged weapon
[3:09:59] <%holydeviant1> @Havictos Because Breath isn't supposed to go into rocks, but it TRIES to make life anyway
[3:10:17] <Happy_Acciden> can you uppercut with the fists while in midair for a doublejump
[3:10:22] <+g4mejoy> Aren't the nails ranged weapons? Maybe use those to set off the bomb thing?
[3:10:37] <+pectusumbra> so you should be getting 100% mass then
[3:10:41] <$lotharrio> Holy shit, @Happy_Acciden is right!
[3:10:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Dunmarkh  It is not by my claw i am once again given stone! I was brought back by golems that wish to pay me Tribute
[3:10:48] <%holydeviant1> Lithic village is all Regular Guys, pat
[3:10:51] <%holydeviant1> sorry to say
[3:10:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> Are you able to kill NPCs and botch quests?
[3:11:01] <$lotharrio> Or wait, can you do heavy attacks in mid-air?
[3:11:24] <chrishansen69_> dark soul 2 last of the giant head holes
[3:11:26] <$lotharrio> So if you mid-air the fist, is it still a downward attack?
[3:11:31] <%AzureGale> Pat got that glow
[3:11:35] <+Havictos> I can see your life almost empty
[3:11:55] <%MelBrooksKA> Your door? Our door
[3:11:59] <penitentpendant> Eat a salad, extend that lifebar~
[3:12:00] <%AzureGale> I think Pat's lifebar is glowing
[3:12:03] <%Broand> this looks more stony than grimy
[3:12:13] <SomeAsianDood> Is this the dark souls of platformers?
[3:12:33] <Happy_Acciden> massacre time?
[3:12:33] <Dunmarkh> like a monolith
[3:12:38] <%holydeviant1> I love the boukder heads, they're so horrible/cute
[3:12:40] <%HaroldDonchee> they look happy about it
[3:12:41] <Finakala> Salt and Sanctuary is the true dark souls of platformers
[3:12:44] <$lotharrio> It's the Dark Souls of rock tumbling.
[3:12:46] <chrishansen69_> yeah, if you were on drugs
[3:12:47] <%Ne1son> Commit to Strength
[3:12:50] <%Ne1son> No more Dex
[3:12:53] <penitentpendant> @SomeAsianDood Closer to Sekiro, for all the parrying
[3:12:55] <%hewlettfan96> Pederast
[3:13:00] <+Havictos> Can't go wrong with revealing hidden areas
[3:13:17] <SomeAsianDood> @penitentpendant I wasn't being that serious but good to know
[3:13:22] <vile_brand> salt was a good game
[3:13:22] <%RealThiele> im hoping the 2nd one is better but i didnt care for the first one
[3:13:35] <+rafaelba93> i tried to like it but... yeah
[3:13:39] <Happy_Acciden> the lamp seems like a good weapon to deal a specific amount of damage
[3:13:40] <Parapattern> It was fine. About the same as Ender Lilies.
[3:13:42] <%Romuken> so lantern needs resonance for big stack dmg i think.
[3:13:43] <a_mad_dragon_> so the lantern is the gunvolt weapon
[3:13:44] <robosqueeb> i found sns to have bad game feel
[3:13:51] <Dunmarkh> how about death's gambit? That one is getting a big update.
[3:13:57] <chrishansen69_> sheets were given about salt and sanctuary
[3:14:04] <+senfood> The character design left a bit to be desired.
[3:14:07] <BlockingDisabled> I thought S&S was good. Not great, but good.
[3:14:07] <%holydeviant1> Yon's got no chill
[3:14:08] <$lotharrio> Yon is totally gonna kill you one day.
[3:14:17] <+pectusumbra> @Dunmarkh I'm going to look at that once the update drops
[3:14:24] <$lotharrio> Oh! He's a yon-dere.
[3:14:29] <Visorak6> so living stone is just green blossoms, got it
[3:14:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> Yon would slit your stone throat for a flint chip
[3:14:42] <Finakala> Death's Gambit is on my backlog, guess I'll wait for the update
[3:14:54] <%Broand> So you get bonuses if you suck dudes into your black hole head?
[3:15:14] <%holydeviant1> @Broand Yep, more souls and estus fuel
[3:15:17] <%californaya> is this a #sponsored stream or is Pat actually playing games because they look neat
[3:15:20] <%californaya> because this looks neat
[3:15:25] <robosqueeb> blightown time?
[3:15:27] <%holydeviant1> down
[3:15:27] <%Broand> down

[3:15:40] <DianaTheAscian> big down
[3:15:43] <%RealThiele> doesnt say sponsored so i figure he bought them
[3:15:57] <+Havictos> I thought you were going to check out the purple stuff
[3:16:04] <Finakala> Pat did tweet about wanting to check out a bunch of games, these included
[3:16:26] <$Ziegsy> sibling MINING?
[3:16:28] <%holydeviant1> Yes, these guys have to pull their siblings right outta the rock
[3:16:36] <%RealThiele> into the sibling mines yeehaw
[3:16:39] <chrishansen69_> yon doesnt even know probably
[3:16:45] <Happy_Acciden> just mine yourself out a sibling no biggie
[3:16:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> This gives a WHOLE NEW meaning to Minors
[3:16:51] <%holydeviant1> @Ziegsy Yes, they gain sentience while in solid rock
[3:16:54] <%Ne1son> lol
[3:16:56] <%AzureGale> Oh no
[3:16:58] <Dunmarkh> oh no

[3:19:39] <+DrPoxx> final evolution? this basic rock? this is dead cells guy's ancestor
[3:19:52] <+pectusumbra> I wonder if resonance boosts parry damage?
[3:19:59] <Happy_Acciden> Are there drugs in this games universe, as in, can you get stoned
[3:20:08] <chrishansen69_> DrPoxx, no evolution needed, they born with it.. maybe its maybeline

[3:50:39] <%Monkeyweed21> "as a reward for you dedication to work, 100 honor points have been deposited in your account"

[3:52:01] <+ALazo> They still do. You just don't hear about them because they're obviously trash.
[3:52:01] <seaechiowai> yup in the first month they would put in some p2w bullshit
[3:52:02] <%RealThiele> RIP Warhammer Online

[3:52:43] <+ScrapKingKeita> I'm convinced, that EVE Online is a money laundering scheme
[3:52:43] <%GabeSweetMan> I loved Ragnarok 15 years ago.
[3:52:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> SWTOR
[3:52:47] <%scaryboisupreme> I have no idea why TOR exists
