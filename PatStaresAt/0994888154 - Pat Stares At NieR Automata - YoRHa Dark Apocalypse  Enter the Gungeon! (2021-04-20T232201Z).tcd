[0:14:01] <+bluedude153> I hope they didnt fix the fishing

[0:14:49] <%solracc25> psaBig 2B
[0:14:52] <+bluedude153> make giant floating text over the ocean saying "Justin Mcelroy doesnt know how to fish"
[0:14:53] <%holydeviant1> @Profmcstevie Sometimes it can be hard to tell how long a raid will be, I guess
[0:14:53] <%JoshManVGH> I'm hoping that it's alternate branches each week!
[0:14:56] <$Trenr> @TerrifyingRei_05 it's not?

[0:16:47] <%Valdorick> Valdorick subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! I can't believe a Dragon comes out and shits all over your character while crying and then pissing himself at the end of this questline.
[0:16:48] <%BigCoffee> Donkey is an expert
[0:16:49] <%vaporousTippler> I didn't care before, but...
[0:16:50] <+bluedude153> when nier drops can we get a nier fishing stream
[0:16:50] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> suspiciously specific denial

[0:16:52] <NitronStreams> Drakenguard 7 plot spoilers
[0:16:54] <$Trenr> you hear that guys? if you set it up, that makes it not furry porn!
[0:16:54] <%RetroCop87> I think you are, Pat
[0:16:55] <Kain5707> Pat do the raid again for the coin :)
[0:16:57] <%walternatorz> You hit the high notes, you're good
[0:16:59] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> 10 minutes seems perfectly acceptable to me and I don't know why it's a big deal for you
[0:17:01] <nevan_44> Kappa
[0:17:04] <onlydonsilva> Has Pat played Gungeon before?
[0:17:06] <+RalvrWuff> We need to ask Lady Iceheart how she smooched with Hraesvelgr!
[0:17:13] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:17:17] <%JoshManVGH> Judging by the life expectancy of Drakenguard characters, not very long.
[0:17:17] <%ElkRiverDog> Are these quests going to disappear at some point?
[0:17:18] <iosephe> weird

[0:22:06] <xeros720> and the Monstars drink their Monsters
[0:22:09] <Profmcstevie> And it tastes like the secret stuff
[0:22:09] <AmericanaRed> sbfpSetIn PAT IS RIGHT
[0:22:10] <+projectmanatees> That would work

[0:23:20] <%NitronStreams> Repetitive tasks in a Yoko Taro story?
[0:23:23] <%JoshManVGH> Aww. I guess there aren't branches.
[0:23:24] <$Ziegsy> I used to roadie for dragonforce and they were sponsored by rockstar energy. the band hated the drink SO much that they were sent special cans filled with water so they could still be seen drinking it

[0:25:55] <OswaldTheDog> ruh row machines
[0:25:56] <%the22cstomp> it's totally something you need to worry about
[0:25:57] <xeros720> a week later this place will be on fire

[0:28:05] <chickenhunter> didnt the raid already say that?
[0:28:05] <VioletRosefall> OH.
[0:28:06] <%JoshManVGH> But what about whats her name...
[0:28:08] <+MeyB_7> monkaS
[0:28:08] <depotagents> wait, why would konogg be able to have a pod if they're from another world?
[0:28:10] <+TombstoneTTromboners> YEP
[0:28:12] <AmericanaRed> WAIT A MOMENT cmonBruh
[0:28:14] <+MeyB_7> The Loooooooooore
[0:28:14] <majindusto> Huh?
[0:28:16] <Goraka91> LA LA LA
[0:28:17] <+redthebaron> oh fuck
[0:28:17] <%albobomb> albobomb subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[0:28:18] <Dwarven_Gaming> but the raid already said that
[0:28:19] <%RetroCop87> so are the Watchers machines?
[0:28:19] <+redthebaron> yeah
[0:28:19] <OswaldTheDog> those pods are babies tho
[0:28:20] <gmbt21xd> Beeg Lore
[0:28:21] <%Valdorick> Watchers hate life. The watchers sing. Lalalalala
[0:28:22] <+MeyB_7> CLEMPS GET ON IT
[0:28:24] <%holydeviant1> Yoko is just gonna take over all of squeenix with dumb windup toy robots
[0:28:24] <blackbookalpha> BEEG Lore
[0:28:24] <%tyler274> people on the ffxiv subreddit told me this was BS lmfao
[0:28:26] <+Birdigalore> So the watchers are copies of machines?!
[0:28:31] <+Rorkdork> explaine?
[0:28:31] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> So.. you think this confirms the Red Girls made the Seeds in the first place?
[0:28:33] <%tyler274> when I said this exact theory
[0:28:33] <blackbookalpha> haha @gmbt21xd
[0:28:35] <OswaldTheDog> BOOM lore
[0:28:36] <%RetroCop87> with FFXIV
[0:28:37] <depotagents> YEAH time loop was my theory too tbh
[0:28:38] <+Berb64> What Zero was trying to stop?
[0:28:43] <Man_in_the_Red> Clemps is totally right about that
[0:28:44] <%Garthunox> But in Drakengard they dont imitate machine lifeforms
[0:28:44] <%BoxNavy> clemps literally had that theory in his automata videos
[0:28:46] <$NumeroHoowan> Nier is just timecube
[0:28:46] <%Monkeyweed21> Thats super wrong @PatStaresAt
[0:28:48] <%ElkRiverDog> Not quite Cain making out with a dragon, but it’s pretty damn close
[0:28:48] <Goraka91> Machines, gods, magic, same thing
[0:28:49] <%Garthunox> so is this a retcon?
[0:28:49] <+TombstoneTTromboners> imagine if the machines made dragons and watchers because they saw the dragons and sin eaters in ffxiv
[0:28:51] <%BigCoffee> Yeah but the only thread not answered is the original drakenguard god
[0:28:53] <karl_rex> You thought it was me Nier but it was me Drakengard all along!
[0:28:55] <+MeyB_7> pat you might be on to something there
[0:28:55] <%HiroTSK5> Drakengard 3 already pretty much confirms that
[0:28:58] <OkamiDude15> So the watchers are machines then?
[0:28:58] <OswaldTheDog> It is
[0:28:58] <tukds> how the fuck are the watcher the machines?
[0:28:59] <+TombstoneTTromboners> Yeah, the "Crown of Thorns" timeloop
[0:29:00] <%Monkeyweed21> the watchers have nothing to do with the machines
[0:29:02] <%Chichen> thats it btw
[0:29:02] <Starkwyn47> Ask Clemps about the time loop.
[0:29:03] <%czeekytv> @TombstoneTTromboners yo
[0:29:06] <%RetroCop87> So Angelus and the Queen go back in time rather than to a different world
[0:29:07] <shieldecho> Yeah but you said it out loud so now you're wrong.
[0:29:09] <ValkahRoctsteel> Big Drakengard lore drop in this end game mmo 24 man raid
[0:29:11] <%ssjklyco> Drakengarde is the super far future instead of another world
[0:29:11] <Goraka91> @TombstoneTTromboners Bruh
[0:29:11] <Dwarven_Gaming> maybe
[0:29:14] <OswaldTheDog> I think the whole point of Nier is that life is cyclical
[0:29:14] <%JoshManVGH> Wait so is Accord some sort of beacon?
[0:29:15] <fritz_dacat> Time paradox in a infinity loop
[0:29:16] <deviljhojho_> is this the chicken themed stream
[0:29:18] <%Chichen> probably until 5.5 or longer
[0:29:19] <$Falilth> isnt that also the idea of gestalts and replicants in a way too
[0:29:19] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Nier: Ouroborous
[0:29:19] <%tyler274> YoRHa androids are plants for fuck sake
[0:29:21] <Dwarven_Gaming> wish there was a BIT more
[0:29:21] <%the22cstomp> that's the point
[0:29:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt It's DRAKE-engard. Drake, y'know... cuz of the dragons...
[0:29:22] <majindusto> OH NO enigmaKEK
[0:29:24] <+MeyB_7> He talks Crazy Talk
[0:29:25] <xeros720> looking forward to clemps video 6-8 months from now
[0:29:25] <thelonechris> Chicken
[0:29:26] <+Birdigalore> I just hope Clemps makes a video cuz this is too big brain for me
[0:29:30] <%holydeviant1> foooooreverrrrrrr
[0:29:30] <%walternatorz> stream over
[0:29:34] <DianaTheAscian> its 3 quest i think
[0:29:35] <%miguelrod777> NotLikeThis DAMN YOU TARO
[0:29:38] <Dwarven_Gaming> that took like 10 mins, if that lol
[0:29:43] <gmbt21xd> So 10 dwarves, 10 weeks
[0:29:47] <+TombstoneTTromboners> until next week
[0:29:50] <TG_Cid11> I think its just the ones that were in the cave
[0:29:51] <gmbt21xd> and we're going to the moon on Endwalker
[0:29:52] <Goraka91> Maye a bunch join at once or something

[0:29:57] <%NitronStreams> Patron and the 7 dwarves
[0:29:58] <%KeiganOfAstora> Damn seriously?
[0:29:58] <blackbookalpha> unclear with Accord. She tries to fix Zero's fate in Drakengard 3, and supplies weapons in Automata
[0:29:59] <majindusto> YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD  BE OVER FAST enigmaKEK
[0:30:04] <shieldecho> OKAY, GOOD STREM
[0:30:08] <fritz_dacat> Short ppl have main quest goals

[0:30:48] <+MeyB_7> I tried getting into FF cause would always talk about it on the podcast couldnt make it past heavensguard
[0:30:48] <depotagents> @Falilth i don't think so? i sided with 2P in my game and mine ended the same as pats
[0:30:49] <karl_rex> Oh no Its Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Which means this is also a Sinoalice crossover
[0:31:03] <%BappoTheMighty> I just got here. Wanted to see some more FFIVX, instead getting gungeon?

[0:31:27] <depotagents> @MeyB_7 tbh you made it past all the bad shit if you made it to heavensward. the game picks up from there.

[0:41:08] <%spitelite> same thing with amazon
[0:41:09] <%SirGO0SE> it used to be nice having a cabby you were familiar with from a car service tbh
[0:41:10] <%BigCoffee> I kinda hate that extra initial 4-5$ charge....and the drivers talking
[0:41:10] <bigben01> I know I saw Taxi Driver
[0:41:11] <%czeekytv> I only took a cab once but the driver was really nice. I guess I got lucky
[0:41:11] <%BoxNavy> ive never had an asshole taxi driver. theyve either been nice or just didnt speak

[0:41:40] <%vaporousTippler> I'm an Uber driver. I do nothing and people are thrilled. Cabs fucked it up for years.
[0:41:43] <%WhereIsWill> psaBig facts
[0:41:47] <%BappoTheMighty> Wait, is there a difference between Taxis and Cabs?

[0:50:18] <%Nordguy> paintballs are such a waste of time and effort
[0:50:21] <%Dakuu75> shitposting has no victims
[0:50:24] <lemon_lover28> makes sense though because the monster has to focus on 4 hunters giving you way more openings

[0:54:27] <%Ne1son> Jumping is useless
[0:54:27] <%Treuan> That don't matter. None of this matters.
[0:54:28] <%BoxNavy> its a show thats for sure
[0:54:28] <penitentpendant> It's Niche
[0:54:29] <%blaccbird914> thats fair
[0:54:32] <%cylish> Aqua Teen simply "is"
[0:54:32] <%yet_another_brony> yeah for real
[0:54:33] <%LaughingCatt> That is the correct reaction to Aqua Teen Hunger Force
[0:54:33] <%weissguard> Sounds about right.
[0:54:34] <frankavich> I'm the same way
[0:54:34] <Explodincatz> its great Pat
[0:54:35] <Devbob98> It’s good to watch at 2am
[0:54:35] <%TIME_PUNCHER> ATHF is a show
[0:54:36] <fritz_dacat> What is sofa king
[0:54:37] <%Zero_Jacks> Facts
[0:54:40] <marvel877> That's the correct response
[0:54:41] <%asgard147> That sounds about right, that show is weird as shit
[0:54:41] <Mathochism> IMO, the Christmas on Mars episode might be the greatest thing to ever be on Adult Swim.
[0:54:42] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Aqua Teen kicks ass
[0:54:43] <IamGrapes> accurate
[0:54:43] <wolfen091> aquateen is hit and miss, Carl episodes are the best ones
[0:54:44] <tukds> It's the best adult swim original show
[0:54:45] <%YakumoYomi> It don't matter. None of this matters.
[0:54:45] <+StevorenoElcamino> I loved that show lol
[0:54:50] <+tweedler92> oh yeah
[0:54:54] <RetroCop87> the best part of ATHF was that time they shut down several cities due to mistaken bombs
[0:54:54] <frankavich> I thought the movie was kind of fun though.
[0:54:55] <%AzureGale> P much
[0:54:57] <%Agami23> that is exactly true
[0:54:57] <marvel877> You see the Film, Pat?
[0:54:58] <fritz_dacat> Did u watch movie
[0:54:58] <%mads_valentine> Carl is the best.
[0:54:59] <%Mathochism> Oh, and the Voyager Belt episode.
[0:55:00] <Devbob98> Welcome to adult swim
[0:55:00] <%ElkRiverDog> I think that’s the point of ATHF
[0:55:02] <%SwdVengeance> That’s the right response
[0:55:05] <%Mathochism> Foreigner, I mean.
[0:55:06] <%baka_sugoi> so weird but fun
[0:55:06] <+kewlmyc> It was funny, but that was when I was like 17 so yeahh
[0:55:14] <wolfen091> as long as you didn't watch tim and Eric, that shit was garbage even when I was stoned

[0:55:23] <SaltyAzteca> Perfect
[0:55:23] <Ravioli_Ronin> If people ask me if ATHF is good, I just say “thaaaaaaaat’s right, jay” and don’t acknowledge that line of questioning any further
[0:55:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> ATHF is dumb for the sake of being dumb. It's not *good*, but itd *fun*
[0:55:32] <%Ynkubus_> Its an Adult Swim stoner show, what else did you expect?
[0:55:32] <ShiningAxis> truly, they were an aqua teen hunger force
[0:55:36] <penitentpendant> There are worse verbal crutches
[0:55:36] <Sotetsu> Oh good, I can finally take a drink
[0:55:37] <lemon_lover28> I use the same verbal crutch
[0:55:38] <+robosqueeb> I met Dana Snyder, the voice of Master shake, and he was a blast to talk to
[0:55:46] <marvel877> Remember that weird Canada/Saw-parody episode?
[0:55:50] <%Agami23> time capsule shows?
[0:55:55] <tukds> direction?
[0:56:12] <%Dakuu75> Like a very neish audiance?
[0:56:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> The best Master Shake was H. Jon Benjamin in the weird live action episode.
[0:56:25] <+Celarious> @PatStaresAt Thoughts on XRA?
[0:56:27] <%Agami23> remember when aqua teen nearly killed cartoon network?
[0:56:28] <Giztech> haha i can say the same about birdman attorney at law
[0:56:32] <%crimsonharvest> A movie that really does that is A Scanner Darkly, those apartments are peak trash

[0:57:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> Twwy wants you to be sad.
[0:57:27] <marvel877> You should have seen the commercials for ATHF. Like the one with the old man singing the theme song while some girl is just dancing behind him the whole time.

[0:58:13] <%Mathochism> @PatStaresAt The REAL question is how do you feel about Sealab 2021?
[0:58:18] <+Veraverse> Fetch red pilled
[0:58:19] <%ClericOfSparda> No
[0:58:20] <%justmildlilac> @mike2hands Yes

[0:58:42] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Sealab 2021 also kicks ass, one of the best Adult Swim shows
[0:58:45] <Stphor> oh man there's so much adult swim for you
[0:58:48] <Botman_R> Good until Murphy's VA died.
[0:58:48] <%Ne1son> Harvey Birdman though
[0:58:49] <Stphor> go watch too many cooks
[0:58:50] <+projectmanatees> Mean girls Is classic
[0:58:51] <%Agami23> you'd have the strength of 5 gorillas
[0:58:51] <%MeyB_7> That show is an acid trip laced in MDMA and rolled in LSD hoping that it doesn't have a bad trip but is consistently tripping balls

[0:59:13] <%psidefx> awesome show great job
[0:59:14] <Devbob98> Tim and Eric is mainstream red letter media
[0:59:14] <IamGrapes> Harvey Birdman AaL is my favorite
[0:59:15] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt EVA wants you to be a horny bullied teenager whose sexual preferences will be permanently shaped by it
[0:59:17] <marvel877> It was good till Murphy died.
[0:59:17] <%Dakuu75> oh man... I couldn't stand any of adult-swims live-action shit.
[0:59:18] <%Jaxnos> you love free real estate though

[0:59:32] <+Dr_DangerPhD> 9 out of 10 Tim and Eric sketches are kinda bad, but that 1 out of 10 tho
[0:59:34] <+Veraverse> Fetch pilled
[0:59:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> tim and eric is awful more often than not.
[0:59:39] <marvel877> Tiny Danson Man.
[0:59:42] <fritz_dacat> Venture bros is agift
[0:59:51] <%czeekytv> Just looked up the XRA scene "7 babies swaddlin'". that's a trip
[0:59:57] <%AzureGale> Gotta clear rooms to recharge your items
[0:59:58] <%JD_Lars> Has Pat ever seen Wonder Showzen?
[1:00:00] <IamGrapes> @rumtumtugnutz i agree with that. unless is Dr Steve Brul
[1:00:01] <lloyddboy> rip team venture
[1:00:02] <+projectmanatees> Superjail was fun
[1:00:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> the cinco urinal shower is funny though
[1:00:02] <%BoxNavy> welp
[1:00:02] <%KineticZen> No bullet parts
[1:00:05] <%KineticZen> Or wahtever they are
[1:00:08] <+polothegreatest> u.u metalocalypse rip
[1:00:08] <+arcielardor> Tim and Eric is the reason we don't have another season of Big O
[1:00:10] <SomeOtherNeb> he got hit? I'm unsubscribing from SuperBunnyHop
[1:00:11] <%YakumoYomi> Start the run over
[1:00:14] <%AzureGale> Perfect casing lost
[1:00:15] <%Dakuu75> you have to do it without getting hit?
[1:00:16] <%TombstoneTTromboners> don't die pat
[1:00:25] <Saltmeisterr> haha point and the stumbo chat
[1:00:25] <%KineticZen> Pat gets triggered
[1:00:26] <Devbob98> Oh boy
[1:00:27] <DudeDern> Boss with default weapons = bad time
[1:00:27] <+Veraverse> No damage run is dead
[1:00:29] <%NitronStreams> venture bros deserved way more attention
[1:00:40] <penitentpendant> Eyein' that 'reset button'
[1:00:42] <%TombstoneTTromboners> f
[1:00:43] <+Veraverse> F
[1:00:46] <%AzureGale> It was going well up to the point you had to fight the boss
[1:00:48] <LorcaNomad> Yeah that's usually how the first floor goes if you want the sewer
[1:00:49] <%justmildlilac> F
[1:00:50] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Pat you ever watch Moral Orel?
[1:00:50] <%yet_another_brony> least you took one down with you
[1:00:54] <lloyddboy> CLONE POG
[1:00:57] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Have you been playing any more Satisfactory or are you waiting for 1.0?
[1:01:01] <%Monkeyweed21> YO CLONE
[1:01:03] <Link232> Oh god Clone
[1:01:05] <%Monkeyweed21> BEST ITEM
[1:01:16] <Saltmeisterr> or u play Huntress
[1:01:18] <AngryPhant0m> I never do well against these two assholes
[1:01:19] <Link232> Clone is the WORST item because it turns a 1 hour run into a 2 hour run
[1:01:20] <%justmildlilac> @patstaresat You like Space Ghost Coast to Coast?
[1:01:23] <%Monkeyweed21> or the Bullet
[1:01:24] <%Chichen> a clone
[1:01:27] <+Veraverse> But the lady with cute doggo tho
[1:01:27] <%the22cstomp> a respawn with all items
[1:01:28] <%yet_another_brony> its the best item
[1:01:32] <lloyddboy> START A NEW RUN WITH ALL YOUR ITEMS WHEN YOU DIE
[1:01:33] <Madovir> a second life
[1:01:36] <Midnight188> when you would die you respawn
[1:01:38] <%Figleafplays> yeah this starting gun is trash
[1:01:38] <+projectmanatees> Ever seen Mission Hill pat?
[1:01:39] <linSP> clone is an extra life but you start from floor 1 with everything
[1:01:43] <%Monkeyweed21> When you die you restart the run with all your items
[1:01:45] <%BoxNavy> cologne
[1:01:45] <LorcaNomad> clone is the nuttiest item in the game
[1:01:47] <+Celarious> THE BEST ITEM IN THE GAME
[1:01:55] <Meltgar> CLONE IS S TIER If i remember
[1:02:05] <penitentpendant> Clone sounds like "New Game Plus" the item
[1:02:05] <%justmildlilac> Same
[1:02:09] <Madovir> it is S tier
[1:02:10] <%NitronStreams> I love the smell of a man's clone
[1:02:12] <LorcaNomad> it's just the best roguelike ever of all time
[1:02:13] <%the22cstomp> i once watched a 10 hour run because someone got like 4 clones
[1:02:14] <Warbot40> Hades tho
[1:02:15] <%BoxNavy> isaac is still my favourite
[1:02:18] <DudeDern> Armor POG
[1:02:24] <Devbob98> It’s so clean and fun to pick up
[1:02:35] <Saltmeisterr> i don't really care for gungeon's tiered loot
[1:02:41] <+ScatterCatt> I like Gungeon, but I'm really fucking bad at it.
[1:02:43] <penitentpendant> Hades, the game I got most of my friends to buy, they only have a combined play time of 10 hours
[1:02:45] <DianaTheAscian> I like dead cells but thats a rougelite i think
[1:02:48] <%Figleafplays> i love having this on my switch
[1:02:48] <linSP> meanwhile isaac be all "what this do x100"
[1:02:49] <BlueLunecy> Isaac never caught my attention. Maybe it was all the poo
[1:02:50] <%caramelatte1> Though this game SUCKS if you dont get an interesting weapon early
[1:02:50] <+Veraverse> I wish I could kill the merchant like Spelunky
[1:02:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> I wish Rogue Legacy was better.
[1:03:01] <%Chichen> My main issue with every roguelike is the first 5-10 minutes of every run
[1:03:02] <%KineticZen> I hate how sluggish Isaac plays
[1:03:04] <%Monkeyweed21> Cleaner than astolfo asshole
[1:03:05] <LorcaNomad> gungeon is a very difficult game but it's so fucking good
[1:03:09] <%Agami23> it needs an ammonomicon
[1:03:12] <+Celarious> Clone is what lets Rainbow runs get stupid and loop nearly infinitely
[1:03:19] <%cylish> cylish subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! Curious if this happens to anyone else,  I know FF11 is fucky, its old ass design makes it really rough to play even now, but I still go back to it constantly, anyone else have games that have "aged poorly" that you still feel compelled to pick up?
[1:03:27] <%BoxNavy> as much as i adore isaac yeah not knowing what an item does is so annoying
[1:03:27] <Saltmeisterr> i still really enjoy gungeon
[1:03:28] <%justmildlilac> At least Gungeon gives you a vague description of everything in the Ammonomicon
[1:03:29] <+Veraverse> This game is fetch pilled?
[1:03:30] <+bluedude153> All the cleft lip and poop stuff in issac rubs me the wrong way
[1:03:30] <MittensBroadcast> dat damage was so smooth
[1:03:30] <Warbot40> After Hades. This is a close 2nd, 3rd or 4th. Rogue Legacy and FTL might have something to say for me.
[1:03:32] <MittensBroadcast> XD
[1:03:37] <AzureGale> Having to move in order to aim your bullets in Isaac freaking sucks
[1:03:37] <%KineticZen> It's fine, it wasn't during a boss battle
[1:03:39] <%shurtal> isaac feels like its a flash game, even though it isn't anymore
[1:03:47] <+Dr_DangerPhD> I can respect Issac for what it is, but I have zero desire to play it
[1:03:50] <%czeekytv> mmmm ftl is pretty damn good
[1:03:50] <Saltmeisterr> excited for splunky when it comes out on switch
[1:03:51] <Link232> Much like Fortnite, you can feel the money; except Isaac probably pulled in more money considering
[1:03:55] <+ScatterCatt> I wish I wanted to play Gungeon more, but I suck ass at it and I don't suck ass at Isaac or Hades or other roguelikes.
[1:03:57] <+oda_flobunaga> Hades is great but is has so little depth in comparison to this or Isaac
[1:03:57] <%bevyrage> pat there's a barrel by the fireplace
[1:03:57] <LorcaNomad> good thing the barrel was so close by
[1:04:02] <$Ziegsy> Isaac started as a flash game
[1:04:02] <%AzureGale> DO IT
[1:04:02] <%Agami23> it was originally a flash game, so yeah
[1:04:03] <%BoxNavy> NotLikeThis
[1:04:04] <%KineticZen> Hot take: the soundtrack for Isaac only got worse when the composer was replaced
[1:04:07] <Ravioli_Ronin> Does gungeon have an easy mode like Hades?
[1:04:08] <%BoxNavy> hes done it
[1:04:10] <%SveriSageAdvice> wasnt it literally a flash game originally on Newgrounds?
[1:04:11] <%KineticZen> As did Doom Eternal
[1:04:13] <Warbot40> I can't stand the cutesy grotesque style it goes for. It's just not for me.
[1:04:13] <%bevyrage> psaBlind
[1:04:22] <%Treuan> Yeah
[1:04:23] <linSP> to be fair, i wiki dive for dark souls and i love that series
[1:04:25] <%AzureGale> Yeah, it could use more weapons
[1:04:27] <+Celarious> Risk of Rain 2 is still infinite fun for me
[1:04:27] <+oda_flobunaga> so little variation in comparison
[1:04:27] <Warbot40> isn't it 6?
[1:04:28] <fritz_dacat> Going under grew on me cause of the dialog
[1:04:29] <%BoxNavy> hades needs more stuff jermaPluto
[1:04:31] <%Monkeyweed21> The Risk of Rain 2 devs have straight up said that they wont add any more items to the lootpool because they want to avoid clogging it with garbage like Isaac
[1:04:38] <Sonny_Firestorm> So it's not just me who barrels water from other rooms to get that Fire out. Good to know.
[1:04:47] <%caramelatte1> Well 10 if you included their alts
[1:04:48] <+oda_flobunaga> more gods more weapons anything
[1:04:55] <MegboyManuel> Pistol only run, lets go
[1:04:59] <BlueLunecy> Dead Cells, now there's a game with variety
[1:05:01] <penitentpendant> @fritz_dacat That game CAN cause critical PLAYER DAMAGE to the right people
[1:05:08] <Saltmeisterr> i feel Hades is still a bit lacking in gameplay content. runs start to feel samey after a while
[1:05:12] <%BoxNavy> irish monkaS
[1:05:12] <%Dr_DangerPhD> The modded character scene for Risk of Rain 2 is amazing, so much content
[1:05:18] <Sonny_Firestorm> @PatStaresAt I have only seen Hades gameplay so far (no PS4 port) but from what I've seen they are the way they are cause they're old archetypes from Bastion.
[1:05:20] <%shurtal> Jeff Kaplan finally decides to abandon burning ship
[1:05:22] <Saltmeisterr> where with gungeon im still discovering shit
[1:05:24] <twohitgood> for a while i thought patrick was irish.
[1:05:25] <+Veraverse> Didn't SuperGiant said that Hades 1.0 would be the final thing content wise?
[1:05:29] <+Dracoshroob> honestly the ror2 devs are good with that, it has a good plethora of items for how the game works
[1:05:29] <Devbob98> Armor break not health loss so don’t count
[1:05:29] <+oda_flobunaga> 15 runs to see all the storyand then no real reason to continue
[1:05:33] <Saltmeisterr> i have yet to get high dragunfire
[1:05:38] <+projectmanatees> Man I hope world of horror gets an update soon
[1:05:42] <Saltmeisterr> @Veraverse yes
[1:05:44] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt Pat you've played ff14 for a while how long will it usually take for them to remove the one gear piece a week limit on current nier raid?
[1:05:47] <LorcaNomad> Risk of rain 2 is amazing but man why does artificer have to suck I love her
[1:05:49] <DudeDern> Saying “this is s
[1:05:54] <Midnight188> gungeon's item pool alaways felt bad to me and i preferred how easy i could get broken in isaac
[1:05:55] <Ravioli_Ronin> I played through hades more for the story; I don’t really care for the difficulty multiplayers, and once I found a weapon that works, I stuck with it
[1:05:57] <lemon_lover28> I would argue that getting guns that either semi, auto or charge but slightly different effects feels way less unique than all the different builds in hades
[1:05:59] <%AncelDeLambert> Rogue Legacy is the only one of these types that I ever played much of
[1:06:02] <%TombstoneTTromboners> fall
[1:06:04] <%caramelatte1> 2 months or so
[1:06:10] <%Monkeyweed21> 3 months
[1:06:14] <DianaTheAscian> K thx
[1:06:14] <%AzureGale> Wait until 5.6
[1:06:14] <penitentpendant> Gear? 5.55. For the coin, 6.0
[1:06:15] <%MegboyManuel> But its so easy to become broken in gungeon
[1:06:15] <LorcaNomad> good gun
[1:06:15] <%AncelDeLambert> and that's because there was tangible progression in that game
[1:06:18] <+Dracoshroob> oh  ya rogue legacy 2 came out, thats pretty good
[1:06:19] <%W1nterTitan> @PatStaresAt Do you have a beginner's guide for ff14?
[1:06:24] <+Veraverse> Yo, Kaine cursing in the new trailer was SICK
[1:06:39] <DudeDern> Saying “this is a good run” on the first floor with the default gun is confusing me
[1:06:40] <penitentpendant> @W1nterTitan The one he made previously is still accurate
[1:06:48] <linSP> this raven THIRSTS for your blood
[1:06:50] <Devbob98> Thankfully you got easiest boss to cheese
[1:06:56] <%AzureGale> MASTER ROUND GET

[1:07:33] <twohitgood> so...does the bat strike out, then?
[1:07:35] <linSP> lol cursed because melee weapons are heresy
[1:07:40] <%Ne1son> Call him Jones, Casey well known crazy
[1:07:46] <twohitgood> oh, spoilers for the old poem but casey strikes out.
[1:07:52] <%shurtal> Call your shot, Babe
[1:07:52] <%Treuan> It's not enter the meleegeon

[1:08:04] <%justmildlilac> yes
[1:08:06] <linSP> the hit does huge damage but its tough
[1:08:09] <SaltyAzteca> BOTH
[1:08:17] <LorcaNomad> IT BEGINS
[1:08:22] <+thegreenbenis> @PatStaresAt You're Pat, your balls are always out.
[1:08:24] <%AzureGale> THE BACKDOWN
[1:08:27] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[1:08:28] <%shurtal> balls out, so you can hit 'em over the moon
[1:08:30] <LorcaNomad> shoulda left it for later
[1:08:37] <+cowkid222> loving these casual gungeon streams.
[1:08:47] <penitentpendant> @thegreenbenis Is not an Orb a ball?
[1:08:49] <DianaTheAscian> what does saving health for later do?
[1:09:02] <%KineticZen> Worst default
[1:09:13] <LorcaNomad> it's the best starter pistol pat you just have to believe
[1:09:17] <%TombstoneTTromboners> you see, if you have health, you can make more mistakes later against tougher foes
[1:09:18] <+thegreenbenis> @penitentpendant I suppose you are technically correct.
[1:09:20] <Manwad> @DianaTheAscian stores them in a little vending machine for the floor.
[1:09:31] <Meltgar> @PatStaresAt Worst starter gun?
[1:09:31] <DianaTheAscian> k
[1:09:34] <%AzureGale> @DianaTheAscian You can access a vending machine and get the health you've collected on that floor if you need it
[1:09:35] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:09:47] <LorcaNomad> Pilot's luck is stored in the gun
[1:09:57] <+gutlesscoward> hell yeah casey
[1:10:03] <%Dakuu75> damn dude, a melee weapon in this game looks hard-as-fuck to use
[1:10:27] <DudeDern> Style-switching with casey
[1:10:28] <LorcaNomad> using Casey might as well be a fine art
[1:10:32] <lloyddboy> i'm a buy key man, from a buy key gang
[1:10:33] <Meltgar> Theres 2 melee in this game right? The AXE-Shotgun and Casey right?
[1:10:40] <+Celarious> The virgin Hegemoney pistol vs. the CHAD Revolver
[1:10:40] <+projectmanatees> Does pat still not like risk of rain 2’s look?
[1:10:45] <penitentpendant> Sword?

[1:18:30] <Madovir> what the fuck
[1:18:38] <%Dakuu75> is Paradox jsut an extra fun-mode or does it have a story?
[1:18:41] <+gutlesscoward> @mdkcde yeah, but probably not interesting for stream
[1:18:43] <emmmdeekay> guns with infinite ammo don't break walls
[1:18:43] <Devbob98> Level one’s about to get bodied
[1:18:44] <gusdabus91> I really wish i didnt suck ass at this game cuz it seems really fun, have you tried isaac?

[1:19:45] <+oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt have you ever gotten the Superhot Watch in this?
[1:19:47] <%justmildlilac> @dakuu75 Paradox has no Past

[1:20:51] <%ChrisPlaysThing> sick
[1:20:59] <emmmdeekay> The Pro move is to Bounce bullets at the same time you hit them with the bat for maximum damage
[1:21:04] <Devbob98> Bat is mightier than the sword

[1:23:57] <LorcaNomad> the greed
[1:24:00] <linSP> good job dog
[1:24:04] <%Treuan> The master round thing is why I cannot get into Gungeon
[1:24:05] <emmmdeekay> they are programmed to eventually anticipate your circle strafing
[1:24:10] <lemon_lover28> I definitely find this boss harder than floor 2s Gorgun
[1:24:11] <AzureGale> TILT
[1:24:13] <G03933> now pet the doggo

[1:28:21] <penitentpendant> @Fluffy_Tamamo No, he's been better about save scumming
[1:28:27] <gusdabus91> I havent seen this new brb screen this shit rules
[1:28:28] <%AzureGale> He is getting too hot
[1:28:30] <+Celarious> No but it tilts him so much that he loses almost immediately after
[1:28:48] <ChungusQuest> Man, I will never get over the audio distortions from bad connection or whatever, they make this song hilarious
[1:28:49] <christopherwpoindexter> @gusdabus91 ☝🏻👍🏻

[1:29:47] <lloyddboy> FLIP
[1:29:53] <christopherwpoindexter> i wonder what a better name for this genre could be....dungeon crawler? uh....
[1:29:54] <%bravebravesrobin> @patstaresat hey man, did you see where they have a Simpsons mod for RE7? Cheer500
[1:29:55] <%Ne1son> Flip all Tables Pat
[1:29:57] <DudeDern> Danger for more cash
[1:30:00] <$spardanwarrior> Flip the tables for free money
[1:30:17] <%Suplexsenpai> You can do eet
[1:30:20] <Shinji2015> Pilot gun sucks
[1:30:21] <+redthebaron> i think pilot has the worst gun
[1:30:31] <deviljhojho_> imagine that
[1:30:46] <+TheShisno> goonjoon? Always fun
[1:30:48] <raikagelord1> Pilot definitely has worst gunz
[1:30:54] <Devbob98> I hope when I’m a ghost, I got an AK
[1:30:55] <+Halfsock> table flip prosperity sounds like a pretty shitty stand
[1:31:10] <Brandon__Brando> @Devbob98 same
[1:31:22] <benjiFG> budget revolver is good when you learn you can tap the shoot button instead of holding for better rate of fire
[1:31:33] <%AzureGale> He's dreaming of licking your face
[1:31:45] <$valkuma> a lot of guns have that benefit
[1:31:47] <penitentpendant> Ye olde manual rapid fire
[1:31:48] <$valkuma> i think
[1:31:53] <gusdabus91> now youre a real desperado
[1:32:20] <$valkuma> alright i guess ill reinstall this game
[1:32:20] <%za7az> Wow, that's like a straight up accuracy buff!
[1:32:31] <lemon_lover28> I don't think I have ever held to fire for a semi-auto gun
[1:32:36] <+TheShisno> So Pat, what's your favorite synergy
[1:32:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> I thought everyone just instinctively mashed the fuck out of their fire button on Gungeon
[1:33:05] <$valkuma> right?
[1:33:10] <$valkuma> i didnt even know the budget revolver autofired
[1:33:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> The RB on my xbox controller is absolutely fucked because of that
[1:33:31] <Brandon__Brando> @ReallyBigRocks thats why I changed my button to the trigger
[1:33:38] <%valriot> Good talk Pat LUL
[1:33:41] <$valkuma> the dodge roll is also required to no-damage some bosses
[1:33:42] <Devbob98> How would you dodge bullets lol
[1:33:44] <benjiFG> gungeon mod where your dodge is replaced with a royal guard
[1:33:46] <$spardanwarrior> FYI, that other gun you have gets a massive buff if you have armor
[1:33:53] <Sonny_Firestorm> I would be more into this game, but my analogs are drifted as fuck.
[1:33:56] <linSP> there probably was earlier implementations of a dodge mechanic
[1:33:57] <christopherwpoindexter> pocketssssss
[1:34:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Brandon__Brando But you can't mash as fast then
[1:34:23] <Saltmeisterr> PAT
[1:34:27] <Saltmeisterr> get that armor
[1:34:35] <gusdabus91> I wanna get into this game but i suck ass at it, i love isaac though
[1:34:37] <Saltmeisterr> at the shop
[1:34:41] <Brandon__Brando> @ReallyBigRocks I never want my thumbs off the sticks
[1:34:44] <lemon_lover28> this game has a lot of hidden synergies/effects for guns, if you hate Issac for that how do you feel about it in this game?
[1:34:49] <Devbob98> Those bouncing bullets are the bane of my existence
[1:34:51] <linSP> browns might be rainbows pat
[1:34:55] <+TheShisno> But Ser Junken tho
[1:34:56] <linSP> you never know
[1:34:59] <%logoth_> munney
[1:35:06] <+redthebaron> the armor on the shop
[1:35:08] <%Ne1son> @lemon_lover28 This game tells you when the items synergize
[1:35:11] <clockworknait1> Why is it even when I get a game free awhile ago, I never really feel like playing it until I see pat stream it? lol
[1:35:19] <Smokin_Fish> I got ser junken once it was great
[1:35:21] <%holydeviant1> @lemon_lover28 The synergies in this game are hidden, some BASIC FUNCTIONALITY of items is hidden in Isaac
[1:35:24] <%holydeviant1> big diff
[1:35:29] <Devbob98> Boo, should’ve been raven
[1:35:29] <gusdabus91> I love the synergies in isaac, I'm just too awful in gungeon to ever get a cool build
[1:35:39] <Smokin_Fish> Junk night ain't got nothing on the cosmic space turtle
[1:35:47] <+sp_abadidea> pat has resumed rolling now that Casey is no longer inhibiting his brain
[1:35:49] <christopherwpoindexter> speaking of drift, for some reason, by my own experience, I thought Joy-con drift had to do with motion control on them, not the analog sticks
[1:35:56] <linSP> nice gun
[1:35:57] <+thegreenbenis> Pat would be cooler with Kamina shades.
[1:35:59] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt armor buffs the ac btw
[1:36:10] <lemon_lover28> @lemon_lover28 fair enough
[1:36:10] <gusdabus91> @thegreenbenis i agree
[1:36:14] <+TheShisno> Could break em just in case of junken
[1:36:14] <Sonny_Firestorm> Yeah, it was awesome to find a second SMG and be like "I CAN DUAL WIELD THEM"
[1:36:15] <penitentpendant> Laser LawnChair
[1:36:16] <$valkuma> Pog
[1:36:22] <%yet_another_brony> the vore

[1:37:18] <IminyourBase> ohh that's different, you were saving them
[1:37:21] <benjiFG> you already have an armor
[1:37:23] <+megaotter> needs to save 2 keys for secret foor
[1:37:28] <lloyddboy> THACO

[1:46:42] <+Jercool> Lose heart get damage
[1:46:42] <%YakumoYomi> The "Doggo" skin
[1:46:43] <benjiFG> makes some enemies highlighted with red and you automatically suck their life
[1:46:45] <Saltmeisterr> gives u vampirism
[1:46:52] <gslayer14> good shit, right?
[1:46:54] <%Garthunox> you absorb health from enemies, not worth!

[1:47:06] <benjiFG> have u beat the rat
[1:47:13] <%MelBrooksKA> That's the sign of a good game
[1:47:16] <Saltmeisterr> I NEVER KNEW THAT EITHER

[1:47:35] <%Chichen> kill who
[1:47:36] <$valkuma> i love this game too
[1:47:41] <LorcaNomad> I really want gungeon 2

[1:47:52] <LorcaNomad> he did it PogChamp
[1:47:52] <%Figleafplays> was exit that bad? thats dissapointing
[1:47:54] <dmtjinni> Exist was bad??
[1:47:57] <%yet_another_brony> aww is exit gungeon bad
[1:47:57] <penitentpendant> "Re-Enter The Gungeon"
[1:48:01] <benjiFG> enter the gungeon: again
[1:48:03] <christopherwpoindexter> GTAV surprisingly also has that "something new every time" vibe
[1:48:04] <gslayer14> YEAH! oh...
[1:48:04] <+niknikmcsneakerton> what was wrong with exit the gungeon?
[1:48:05] <Saltmeisterr> ABBY TIME
[1:48:05] <LorcaNomad> exit was bad yes
[1:48:07] <%Treuan> Nailed it
[1:48:07] <+meatmaaan> well it was a mobile game
[1:48:08] <+redthebaron> i always lose the crest like a room away from it
[1:48:09] <%AzureGale> You scared the poor Gief
[1:48:12] <linSP> nooo the puppo
[1:48:14] <thepenguinprince> Hey Pat, how goes the gungeoneering?
[1:48:18] <Devbob98> You scare gief with the hype
[1:48:18] <%holydeviant1> @yet_another_brony it is very obv a mobile game
[1:48:20] <Lucid_Dynamic> How many hours does Pat have?
[1:48:25] <christopherwpoindexter> *that "learn something new
[1:48:25] <%AncelDeLambert> I never got far enough into this to learn: what does the masoleum do?
[1:48:28] <%holydeviant1> it's good! but very mobile
[1:48:29] <LorcaNomad> it's a slow gun yeah
[1:48:39] <Saltmeisterr> it does alot more damage now
[1:48:42] <SaltyAzteca> With armor, it shoots like that
[1:48:44] <penitentpendant> @AncelDeLambert Bonus floor that's hard to get to
[1:48:50] <Saltmeisterr> and its way more ammo efficient
[1:48:53] <IamGrapes> duct tape it to the wind-up gun
[1:48:55] <%holydeviant1> @AncelDeLambert secret level entrance, need armor from sewers to open
[1:48:56] <IamGrapes> many shoots
[1:49:16] <$spardanwarrior> It goes from "do combo" to "big number"
[1:49:22] <gslayer14> @PatStaresAt another fun fact: red ammo crates fill 50% of your current gun, but only %10 of all your other guns
[1:49:32] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt do u know about the trick to stop the rat from stealing items?
[1:49:32] <+meatmaaan> abbey is a chill place
[1:49:38] <SaltyAzteca> Pray to the bullet gods for Akey 47
[1:49:42] <benjiFG> purple

[1:49:52] <+shry7> it's red
[1:50:09] <%Jaxnos> i keep accidentally reading void core as vore core
[1:50:10] <christopherwpoindexter> *Woolie voice* a kay for the seven, very best there is
[1:50:11] <gslayer14> it's obviously gamecube red
[1:50:22] <esoteric_order_of_swagon> "D&D but everything has a gun" will never not be funny to me

[1:51:22] <$Ziegsy> J A K I E B R OW N
[1:51:29] <Mr_JustinJones> Pulp Fiction or Jackie Brown?
[1:51:34] <tacostarvedbeast> feel like gun muncher is never worth it
[1:51:45] <christopherwpoindexter> i quoted him from an old playthrough about the AK-47
[1:51:56] <Smokin_Fish> ya fuck the gun muncher
[1:51:57] <benjiFG> it only gives you shit in the rarity range of the guns you give it
[1:51:59] <$Ziegsy> @Mr_JustinJones Jackie brown, that trailer was before starship troopers on vhs
[1:52:00] <+DCross13> more like cum muncher
[1:52:03] <%za7az> PogChamp
[1:52:04] <esoteric_order_of_swagon> Fear the old gun
[1:52:08] <LorcaNomad> gun muncher is only worth it if you have nothing but trash
[1:52:13] <+redthebaron> i hate the boss of this level so much
[1:52:16] <christopherwpoindexter> @skyentombment maybe you opened Spotify or another app with the podcast playing?
[1:52:16] <gslayer14> gun muncher averages the rarity of the two guns you put in, then goes down by one rank
[1:52:21] <%Ne1son> rip ac 15
[1:52:22] <christopherwpoindexter> by accident*
[1:52:24] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt To get good stuff, you need to put good guns.
[1:52:32] <Mr_JustinJones> Ah I Jackie Brown
[1:52:37] <%MeyB_7> damn this runs gettin intsense

[1:53:05] <Fluffy_Tamamo> Potato man is throwing lumituSmug
[1:53:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat's worst enemy is dimly lit holes in the floor
[1:53:11] <%Agami23> pat i know you forget to breath sometimes but you have to stop choking
[1:53:16] <%JoshManVGH> Pat you don't need to enter the gungeon THAT deeply
[1:53:17] <christopherwpoindexter> NO PRESSURE AMIRITE
[1:53:21] <%Ne1son> No matter what do not restart
[1:53:22] <LorcaNomad> mega douser PogChamp
[1:53:29] <christopherwpoindexter> @joshmanvgh 😏
[1:53:30] <$valkuma> doesnt your potion jar have a full heart
[1:53:35] <LorcaNomad> siren's okay
[1:53:35] <lloyddboy> meh
[1:53:37] <gslayer14> siren's decent, but not worth the cash
[1:53:37] <+meatmaaan> meh
[1:53:40] <%ArchimerCXV> more pushback than damage
[1:53:40] <SaltyAzteca> Water shotgun
[1:53:46] <%za7az> ehhh
[1:53:46] <Saltmeisterr> its alright
[1:53:48] <IamGrapes> you dont want Sponge?
[1:53:51] <%Ne1son> Mutation though @PatStaresAt
[1:53:51] <Tuna_Can_0> its okayish
[1:53:56] <+redthebaron> i would consider the sponge
[1:54:03] <%ArchimerCXV> meat beam
[1:54:09] <+meatmaaan> big sprayyy
[1:54:11] <gslayer14> mutations a good beam weapon
[1:54:13] <Saltmeisterr> meat beam
[1:54:23] <$Ziegsy> whys he being shot at by marge simpson
[1:54:29] <LorcaNomad> mutation is actually pretty good just hard to use
[1:54:33] <%Ne1son> Clone
[1:54:37] <benjiFG> some enemies here are guaranteed jammed
[1:54:41] <Saltmeisterr> clone
[1:54:41] <gslayer14> abbey has inherent curse
[1:54:42] <+meatmaaan> mutation has some really good synergies too
[1:54:42] <%ArchimerCXV> secret rooms can just have cursed enemies regardless
[1:54:45] <SaltyAzteca> Mutation is Tetsuo's arm isnt it
[1:54:48] <gslayer14> clone isn't cursed
[1:54:50] <+meatmaaan> well it came from a black chest
[1:54:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> you got it from a cursed chest
[1:54:55] <christopherwpoindexter> omg the revolver shaped bit in the floor 🥴
[1:55:01] <$valkuma> Pog explosion
[1:55:01] <LorcaNomad> Clone doesn't have curse does it?
[1:55:06] <s1rcuit> wouldn't surprise me if clone was cursed, just look at it
[1:55:19] <+MrBaldachin> you got it from a black chest
[1:55:23] <Saltmeisterr> old king doesn't fuck around
[1:55:26] <lloyddboy> this floor is cursed
[1:55:36] <SaltyAzteca> I think its just the floor
[1:55:36] <%yet_another_brony> no curse, just some floors have jammed
[1:55:39] <%ArchimerCXV> guys, black chest are not inherently cursed, it's the abbey
[1:55:42] <+redthebaron> i think the abbey has some jammed minions that spawn here pat
[1:55:49] <%Dakuu75> So being cursed summons tougher enemies? Is there an oppose curse effect?
[1:56:07] <%AzureGale> @Dakuu75 Yeah, coolness
[1:56:11] <Saltmeisterr> @Dakuu75 no
[1:56:21] <+redthebaron> @Dakuu75 not exactly reverse curse but there is coolness
[1:56:36] <emmmdeekay> Just do a perfect roll pat, popehats are not that hard
[1:56:37] <+meatmaaan> curse can be good tho
[1:56:39] <Saltmeisterr> coolness doesn't decrease enemy difficulty right?
[1:57:07] <benjiFG> nope
[1:57:28] <tetrabrick1lt> but makes your cock bigger though
[1:57:37] <benjiFG> this is true
[1:57:41] <%valriot> I THOUGHT YOU MEANT ICHIBAN

[1:59:27] <gslayer14> old king is just beefy as fuck
[1:59:41] <+meatmaaan> tanky king
[1:59:50] <%ArchimerCXV> boss scaling vs high burst damage is such a curve the best items in the game actively ignore it

[2:02:06] <dan_g_v> ouch
[2:02:07] <%Treuan> Well now we know, it'll be there next time
[2:02:07] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt did you know, if u teleport out of a room with an item in it, then teleport in it, it prevents the Rat from stealing it for the next adjacent rooms. useful for making the most out of ammo drops
[2:02:10] <SaltyAzteca> Its okay you have a Clone
[2:02:22] <+qanonisadeathcult> yo when is the roblox stream?
[2:02:27] <gslayer14> gonna try rat?
[2:02:34] <%Ne1son> Orage gave you a Heart container @PatStaresAt
[2:02:34] <%KishinGrek> KishinGrek subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! I'm not one to recommend anime, but a recent one has caught my attention, Odd Taxi, it's an thriller about anthropomorphic animals in downtown Japan , the disappearance of a young high school girl, a loner taxi driver and the Yakuza. kiryu's VA is in it,
[2:02:44] <%Dakuu75> What was the orange?
[2:02:47] <benjiFG> oh right
[2:02:48] <%ArchimerCXV> still gained a free ehart for eating it
[2:03:15] <SoAndSoap> ill be your corn muffin sandwhich
[2:04:07] <benjiFG> nice line up
[2:04:26] <SaltyAzteca> Pray for vampire
[2:04:38] <gslayer14> think of it this way
[2:04:38] <+BigBruthaThunda> palms r sweaty
[2:04:44] <Devbob98> Do worse then to be stress free
[2:04:49] <gslayer14> this run is just free items for next ru
[2:04:53] <%KishinGrek> I felt the same with binding of issac
[2:04:53] <gslayer14> or you win
[2:04:57] <gslayer14> either way
[2:04:58] <+meatmaaan> curse = more money
[2:05:00] <SoAndSoap> buy a condo
[2:05:14] <%Dakuu75> I like that “save for later” mechanic. That wasnt there last time i played (which was a long time ago)
[2:05:18] <lloyddboy> wait til you re-earn master rounds off clone run
[2:05:27] <LorcaNomad> pat you have some very good guns and clone and a lot of health this run is pretty much a guaranteed win don't worry
[2:05:46] <Madovir> it was in AD&D
[2:06:01] <%ArchimerCXV> gunslinger's pretty rad tho
[2:06:24] <%Lion_kun> Just save scum like I did.
[2:06:25] <%valriot> Doing the Lich NOW is guarenteed, cos the run is busted cos Clone. But beating with Gunslinger, is seperate
[2:06:30] <LorcaNomad> gunslinger gets stupid strong very fast thouh
[2:06:37] <%Ne1son> Rat Room
[2:06:38] <%ArchimerCXV> oh...shit i guess i was very lucky with my gunslinger unlock then
[2:06:40] <Devbob98> That’s so much
[2:06:48] <%Dakuu75> Does the health you save, follow you to the next floor? Or stays on the floor you got it?
[2:06:48] <%neroforte177> well if you dont like gunslinger try royal guard or swordmaster Kappa
[2:06:55] <linSP> da rats
[2:07:02] <LorcaNomad> pat doesn't have rat key so no rats for pat
[2:07:15] <lemon_lover28> oh, that seems stressful. I have never cleared the game once outside of coop where I got carried
[2:07:21] <$Cobra743> i thought Pat sucked at this game?
[2:07:22] <linSP> the rat fight is sooo good tho
[2:07:27] <gslayer14> now that i'm thinking about it, have you done the elevators pat?
[2:07:28] <%ArchimerCXV> gotta spend mad cash for that key then a fixed price forever
[2:07:33] <SaltyAzteca> That was so pro
[2:07:34] <Devbob98> The yelps bring me joy
[2:07:37] <benjiFG> fuckin sick
[2:07:47] <+projectmanatees> We’re da rats
[2:07:58] <%Paperware> Thought Crazy Talk was just about to punch Pat in the mouth for a sec
[2:08:00] <%valriot> LUL
[2:08:04] <CrimsonFox777> True
[2:08:05] <%Ne1son> Not true
[2:08:05] <BlueLunecy> What of it
[2:08:10] <faithless_zealot> To be fair, do for most games =P
[2:08:12] <%Ne1son> You are pretty good at FF14
[2:08:12] <Fluffy_Tamamo> Are you just playing the paradox by chance, or do you still have their past to beat?
[2:08:14] <Mr_JustinJones> But you do
[2:08:15] <%CalderGaming> no
[2:08:15] <gslayer14> and yet we're still here
[2:08:15] <%SaiyanShoto> And?
[2:08:15] <+AudacityESQ> Anyone else here enjoy video games?
[2:08:15] <jbrachob> well.. yeah

[2:08:18] <%Chichen> no :)
[2:08:18] <+BigBruthaThunda> BibleThump BibleThump
[2:08:19] <%Dakuu75> Lol
[2:08:22] <+TheotherKristian> It is all of his life now
[2:08:22] <penitentpendant> I mean, you're entertaining while you suck, which is something
[2:08:22] <Srthunda> Its tragegy in motion really
[2:08:24] <benjiFG> holy shit pat you're so good at video games and your meat is huge
[2:08:26] <Devbob98> You’re good at tactics
[2:08:27] <LorcaNomad> nah pat's pretty good at gungeon gungeon is just really fucking hard guys
[2:08:27] <gslayer14> you must have *something* going for you
[2:08:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat stunts on this game
[2:08:31] <IamGrapes> much like Arin Hanson
[2:08:31] <DrkJP520> Sup, nerds
[2:08:38] <$Cobra743> well your getting msarried so you've already acomplished more than i ever will Pat
[2:08:45] <faithless_zealot> but admittedly, you're not doing half bad here
[2:08:45] <+Gespens> People love backseating to gamers. Someone tried to backseat one of the hololive girls playing Rise IMMEDIATELY after she said she's pumped in about 5k hours into the series and she went off on them
[2:08:47] <linSP> this is the streamer who won a fortnight against babies on his first try
[2:08:48] <+niknikmcsneakerton> gungeon is hella hard
[2:08:51] <dustyjordans> Reminder that this game is currently free on ps4!
[2:09:03] <+projectmanatees> You’re good at RE 2
[2:09:05] <%MelBrooksKA> Well, we thought you were trash at video games, then we saw Paige play puzzle games and learned what real trash is
[2:09:07] <gslayer14> ice cube amazing
[2:09:08] <LorcaNomad> pretty sure that's generally meh
[2:09:15] <%ArchimerCXV> think of it as a special tool for later
[2:09:16] <gslayer14> unfortunate you didnt get double vision
[2:09:21] <BlueLunecy> Makes you cooler though
[2:09:22] <gslayer14> or was that last run?
[2:09:22] <%templar010> templar010 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 19 month streak! Happy 4/20!
[2:09:23] <SoAndSoap> just find more keys
[2:09:25] <%ArchimerCXV> increases coolness too again
[2:09:30] <+AudacityESQ> @dustyjordans I’m sorry what?

[2:09:31] <+tetraes> i think your goof at RE games
[2:09:42] <SaltyAzteca> Easy, just keep moving
[2:09:54] <%MelBrooksKA> Treadnaught is a pretty good name
[2:09:54] <SaltyAzteca> Its okay, you have Clone
[2:10:01] <+megaotter> mine flayer is way worse imo
[2:10:03] <LorcaNomad> the grenade attack is fucking bullshit
[2:10:05] <dustyjordans> @AudacityESQ gungeon is free on ps4
[2:10:10] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That went well.
[2:10:14] <linSP> i HATE mine flayer
[2:10:16] <$KishinGrek> fuck you tank
[2:10:16] <gslayer14> mine flayer worse yeah
[2:10:18] <LorcaNomad> at least no mine flayer
[2:10:19] <ChungusQuest> well you made that look easy as fuck
[2:10:21] <Saltmeisterr> AYE
[2:10:24] <+BigBruthaThunda> ez tank
[2:10:26] <Saltmeisterr> my favorite gun
[2:10:38] <lemon_lover28> I also prefer tank over mine flayer
[2:10:40] <$valkuma> ***
[2:10:45] <%Magewart> Oh this game fucks
[2:10:52] <%Dakuu75> Oh, you cant get hit even if you have a shield?
[2:10:54] <benjiFG> ogey ratt
[2:11:03] <Saltmeisterr> spooke time
[2:11:05] <%ArchimerCXV> canon balrog is the easiest but that just makes it feel cheap when his patterns overlap
[2:11:24] <%ArchimerCXV> man i love the hollows music
[2:11:25] <%MelBrooksKA> Is the Windup Gun the reason I keep hearing "Pop Goes the Weasel"?
[2:11:26] <LorcaNomad> 4th floor secret floor is pretty much always not worth it though unless you just want to do more floors
[2:11:36] <gslayer14> @MelBrooksKA yeah
[2:11:47] <%Dakuu75> @melbrookska Yeah lol
[2:11:51] <gslayer14> that is what the refrance
[2:11:56] <+AudacityESQ> @dustyjordans Indeed it is, bag secured — thanks!
[2:11:57] <LorcaNomad> it is because synergy
[2:11:57] <$valkuma> the battery gun has no upgrades
[2:12:00] <benjiFG> I only do the secret floor when i have the weird egg
[2:12:01] <$valkuma> the wind up gun does
[2:12:08] <Devbob98> It’s faster for sure
[2:12:23] <Saltmeisterr> shock rifle has a nice synergy
[2:12:23] <$Mekhet09> Doesn't matter until you hit the bos though.
[2:12:29] <%ArchimerCXV> shelleton time \o/
[2:12:29] <dustyjordans> @AudacityESQ np!

[2:13:43] <$Mekhet09> johns?
[2:13:51] <+meatmaaan> bullet hell and forge have bs trap rooms
[2:13:55] <$valkuma> i have never had a synergy in this game
[2:14:04] <LorcaNomad> pat's not crazy he's actually very right
[2:14:15] <%ArchimerCXV> mimic tooth this late hurts
[2:14:16] <LorcaNomad> tooth necklace PogChamp
[2:14:18] <$RealThiele> most synergies are meh anyways
[2:14:23] <+oda_flobunaga> Its all coming apart, like a gangbang at an anti-social convention
[2:14:24] <dan_g_v> bah

[2:14:28] <Tuna_Can_0> free chests PogChamp
[2:14:30] <LorcaNomad> he has clone it still counts lol

[2:14:32] <+megaotter> forge is harder pat is wrong
[2:14:35] <linSP> wheres all da keys
[2:14:37] <Tuna_Can_0> but you gotta fight em
[2:14:38] <+meatmaaan> akey 47 is the only one to worry about
[2:14:39] <SaltyAzteca> tooth necklace pat
[2:14:43] <LorcaNomad> just get two keys 4Head
[2:15:04] <benjiFG> ohohoho
[2:15:04] <DrkJP520> Cracked walls often appear in chest rooms, so make it a habit to shoot them and check
[2:15:04] <%Magewart> CHALLENGE TIME
[2:15:19] <%ArchimerCXV> room modifiers
[2:15:26] <%ArchimerCXV> some are easy some are beyond obnoxious
[2:15:32] <linSP> king
[2:15:32] <LorcaNomad> CROWN PogChamp
[2:15:32] <$valkuma> Wow

[2:15:54] <gslayer14> touhou boss time
[2:15:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> Stupid Hat Get
[2:16:14] <$RealThiele> C-15 with armor is hnnngh
[2:16:16] <$Mekhet09> it's busted with the right synergies.
[2:16:22] <LorcaNomad> it does yeah
[2:16:23] <lloyddboy> homing bullets
[2:16:25] <%ArchimerCXV> synergy turns it into beams
[2:16:25] <linSP> yes
[2:16:28] <+redthebaron> homing bullets help
[2:16:28] <$valkuma> it was murdering those enemies really fast
[2:16:29] <gslayer14> plenty of synergies
[2:16:33] <%ArchimerCXV> all it really wants is homing
[2:16:36] <%Ne1son> Electric bullets with it is pretty good
[2:16:38] <DrkJP520> Now the enemies are experiencing bullet hell
[2:16:39] <+Solipsist_Construct> homing or lightning bullets is pretty great
[2:16:40] <gslayer14> homing
[2:16:42] <gslayer14> bouncing
[2:16:44] <gslayer14> zombie
[2:16:46] <Tuna_Can_0> watch pat throw the run for the silly hat atpRtsd
[2:17:01] <%ArchimerCXV> bullets for the bullet crown is pretty kino basically
[2:17:04] <lloyddboy> FLIP
[2:17:11] <$RealThiele> high priest inc
[2:17:21] <+meatmaaan> a lot of the weird guns dont even need synergy just some good passives
[2:17:23] <%Dakuu75> tookie-tookie
[2:17:52] <DrkJP520> Oh shit you got the dark souls thing
[2:18:02] <+redthebaron> everything is a mimic and every mimic is a friend
[2:18:04] <%Monkeyweed21> what about A-Key 47
[2:18:40] <benjiFG> even without the ring it's still free chests
[2:19:08] <$Mekhet09> maybe the boss.
[2:19:10] <LorcaNomad> buy the hp pat
[2:19:12] <%ArchimerCXV> boss might be goodies yeah
[2:19:19] <Devbob98> Shoot other chest
[2:19:19] <s1rcuit> @benjiFG only if you can win the fight without taking damage
[2:19:19] <SaltyAzteca> Statues
[2:19:21] <Saltmeisterr> hope for the boss drop
[2:19:28] <SaltyAzteca> Its gonna be statues
[2:19:31] <$valkuma> Swap out of void c ore while explosion slow is on cooldown.
[2:19:33] <dan_g_v> why HP when Pat will obviously pull a flawless boss fight
[2:19:33] <%Ne1son> But no
[2:19:35] <$Mekhet09> no
[2:19:38] <%Monkeyweed21> if you get A-key 47 and the skeleton key it upgrades to be the best gun in the game with infinite ammo
[2:19:39] <$Mekhet09> NO
[2:19:41] <SaltyAzteca> No
[2:19:41] <+redthebaron> wait
[2:19:44] <Saltmeisterr> no
[2:19:45] <gslayer14> favorite synergy is gungine gunslinger Keepo
[2:19:46] <%Ne1son> Why do that
[2:19:47] <+redthebaron> after boss
[2:19:48] <benjiFG> @s1rcuit pat has the ice pistol so it's a ez fight
[2:19:55] <+megaotter> why
[2:19:59] <benjiFG> for mimics
[2:19:59] <CrimsonFox777> EVERYONE PANIC panicBasket
[2:20:02] <LorcaNomad> it'll just give you junk cuz you have a key
[2:20:06] <SaltyAzteca> Ice slows enemies
[2:20:11] <DrkJP520> Shoot the chest room walls. Cracked walls are pretty common in those
[2:20:18] <SaltyAzteca> Called it
[2:20:22] <$RealThiele> roll time
[2:20:31] <+thegreenbenis> HOLY FUCK THIS IS RAD
[2:20:39] <$Mekhet09> I hate this boss

[2:41:07] <gslayer14> unless it refill?
[2:41:17] <gslayer14> it's been a while since my last clone
[2:41:20] <Devbob98> Chat just let him enjoy hell
[2:41:30] <tacostarvedbeast> u return exactly as you are just max health, so no free ammo
[2:41:32] <%dork_doggler> @gslayer14 he has clone then? it's trviallyt easy to refill all ammo in the first couple floors
[2:41:58] <Fluffy_Tamamo> I can't tell if Pats missing a strat or just nobody has confidence in him. snuffThink
[2:42:21] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt I believe in you
[2:42:21] <%AzureGale> Chat has NO CONFIDENCE
[2:42:50] <tacostarvedbeast> always chance to f it up, unless u have the black hole gun, that thing is busted
[2:42:50] <%AzureGale> Pat has sheer heroic willpower
[2:42:51] <%dork_doggler> More keys, yes. More ammo, hell no
[2:42:52] <linSP> lich is good practice for the lich
[2:42:53] <gslayer14> if you have more ammo, slightly more chance of lead god, which would be super cool
[2:42:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat is only bad at EVIL ZONE
[2:43:04] <%Ne1son> shock rifle is no goodlate
[2:43:05] <Saltmeisterr> i just wanna see a full clone run
[2:43:27] <%dork_doggler> psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab
[2:43:31] <BlueLunecy> Nothing but confidence
[2:43:32] <gslayer14> CUBE is your worst enemy
[2:43:34] <+wizard_of_diamonds> wow LUL
[2:43:35] <linSP> its fine
[2:43:37] <$Mekhet09> All that work.
[2:43:37] <lagandcrash> uh oh
[2:43:39] <CrimsonFox777> Have confidence!.... No confidence!
[2:43:41] <linSP> run 2 baby!
[2:43:42] <%AzureGale> Your second chance begins now!
[2:43:44] <benjiFG> I had a run the other day where I got the rat ring so I was gonna trade the bullet that can kill the past for a chance at the clone but I was the paradox so I couldn't get the bullet :(
[2:43:45] <$Mekhet09> And one cube just wrecked your shit.
[2:43:47] <Saltmeisterr> CLONE IT UP
[2:43:55] <%bassoontyphoon> F
[2:43:55] <%dork_doggler> He only needs two red fillups it's not a big deal
[2:43:57] <Fluffy_Tamamo> It puts you back to FLOOR 1?! veiS
[2:44:00] <Devbob98> The cube always wins
[2:44:01] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt be confident, girls like it when you're confident
[2:44:02] <gslayer14> now for the victory lap
[2:44:03] <linSP> wouldnt it be funny if he got another clone
[2:44:07] <+redthebaron> do you get lie double master rounds?
[2:44:11] <+cowkid222> here we go
[2:44:17] <%dork_doggler> WORTH
[2:44:21] <%Chichen> @Fluffy_Tamamo Yes, but he keeps EVERYTHING.
[2:44:22] <benjiFG> get the scope for the crown gun
[2:44:23] <+cowkid222> you can yeah
[2:44:24] <gslayer14> scopes nice
[2:44:27] <+redthebaron> scope is good
[2:44:34] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt btw master rounds reset so u can get them again
[2:44:36] <%Treuan> Oh
[2:44:39] <gslayer14> pog
[2:44:41] <%valriot> LUL BUSTED
[2:44:42] <Fluffy_Tamamo> Well yeah, but floor 1?? That seems kinda dogshit to me.
[2:44:44] <%bassoontyphoon> Way way back in the 1980s
[2:44:47] <+insomniacandroid> is this pat's first tiem playing gungeon?
[2:44:58] <benjiFG> YOU'RE highly pog
[2:44:59] <gslayer14> indeed, the poggiest
[2:45:01] <s1rcuit> what just happened?
[2:45:04] <Azathotic> IMO the crown isn't that good
[2:45:06] <gslayer14> totally
[2:45:08] <%dork_doggler> @Fluffy_Tamamo three treasures and master rounds for nearly no effort sounds dogshit to you?
[2:45:08] <+UltraViolet371> it's BASED even
[2:45:11] <+insomniacandroid> did he get a rainbow chest or something
[2:45:18] <$Mekhet09> I thought pog wasn't an acceptable word anymore.
[2:45:31] <DrkJP520> Try beating the rat if u haven't already. So worth it
[2:45:37] <+insomniacandroid> I see this isn't his first time playing because he's the paradox
[2:45:55] <Fluffy_Tamamo> @Fluffy_Tamamo There's always time to fuck up and die. Replaying the whole game for more rolls does sound shit, yes.
[2:45:57] <%Ne1son> Pog has been reclaimed from the Goo
[2:46:16] <%Zero_Jacks> GooGaa
[2:46:24] <%Dakuu75> lol
[2:46:26] <%Chichen> nevuh evuh.
[2:46:30] <gslayer14> @Fluffy_Tamamo amazing how wrong this is
[2:46:35] <Azathotic> Shoot your Gootecks my Dudetecks
[2:46:37] <%AzureGale> Gotta get more master rounds
[2:46:59] <Fluffy_Tamamo> I was just surprised by it jesus christ why is chat getting so salt over it?
[2:47:08] <Fluffy_Tamamo> calm down
[2:47:18] <gslayer14> downside of it is that it eats casings
[2:47:19] <+PickyPrinny> Must...not...make...slammer joke. Will reveal age
[2:47:28] <%AzureGale> Ha
[2:47:29] <lagandcrash> nice
[2:47:30] <Fluffy_Tamamo> Thats why I said it seems shit TO ME
[2:47:34] <Saltmeisterr> ak
[2:47:45] <lloyddboy> FLAK
[2:47:50] <+SilverStasis> flak is good
[2:47:51] <gslayer14> FLAK
[2:47:51] <$RealThiele> moar bullet
[2:47:53] <%valriot> FLAK LUL
[2:47:55] <$valkuma> that rocket launcher is nutty.
[2:47:57] <gslayer14> GEDDIT
[2:47:59] <lagandcrash> hey google
[2:47:59] <ARobotFromtheFuture1> Black hole gun + that tentacle gun is broken. You physically cannot lose with that synergy @patstaresat
[2:48:05] <gslayer14> F L A K
[2:48:09] <%Blackmage9999> More DAKKA!
[2:48:21] <%AzureGale> There has yet to be man who can outsmart bullet
[2:48:21] <gslayer14> flak crown will be spicy
[2:48:24] <$RealThiele> +1 daKKA
[2:48:25] <gslayer14> boss killer
[2:48:26] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Sweet
[2:48:32] <%Chichen> try the crown with this LUL
[2:48:32] <%Treuan> This run is crazy
[2:48:33] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> RPGPhatLoot
[2:48:44] <%valriot> Flak Crown has created the Frame Rate gun
[2:48:51] <lagandcrash> niiice
[2:48:52] <linSP> nooo the watur
[2:48:52] <%Ne1son> This gives the good chemicals
[2:48:59] <%AzureGale> Yeah, this does slap
[2:48:59] <Saltmeisterr> NO
[2:49:04] <$valkuma> use cold gun
[2:49:08] <lagandcrash> not the goop barrel :(
[2:49:09] <%arcielardor> use your ice gun
[2:49:13] <gslayer14> water quest is a go
[2:49:14] <%ArchimerCXV> time for precision barrel gameplay
[2:49:15] <benjiFG> use your pee
[2:49:19] <%yet_another_brony> try cold gun
[2:49:20] <Saltmeisterr> ice works ye
[2:49:21] <%dork_doggler> @PatStaresAt ice cube gun might put fiore out
[2:49:25] <%AzureGale> Use your ice gun
[2:49:35] <thelonechris> "It's a barrel. It ROLLS."
[2:49:43] <gslayer14> goop, not ice
[2:49:49] <gslayer14> unfortuantely
[2:50:06] <TheTakkster> hahaaaa worth a "shot"
[2:50:14] <LorcaNomad> well pat you ready to ace every boss?
[2:50:27] <LorcaNomad> ew
[2:50:31] <gslayer14> uh oh
[2:50:36] <benjiFG> believe in yourself
[2:50:45] <silentdzoru> can you get master rounds for a 2nd time???
[2:50:46] <gslayer14> choke hard
[2:50:50] <+gutlesscoward> he's choking on all the master rounds he's gonna get
[2:50:54] <lagandcrash> slap their nuts
[2:50:54] <%dork_doggler> Teleporter is great in bullet hell, you basically skip, on average, half the level
[2:50:55] <%Valdorick> Lewd
[2:50:58] <linSP> just expect to choke and you wont
[2:51:08] <benjiFG> holy fuck
[2:51:08] <%ArchimerCXV> gatling gull no cover, oh fun
[2:51:09] <$valkuma> THATS HILARIOUS
[2:51:16] <linSP> NOOOO
[2:51:23] <+SilverStasis> NOOOOOOOO
[2:51:31] <Azathotic> God I hate Gatling Gull so much
[2:51:31] <%the22cstomp> F
[2:51:35] <+gutlesscoward> I thought you were going to get them all, pat
[2:51:35] <%AzureGale> At least you didn't die
[2:51:37] <lagandcrash> :(
[2:51:37] <gslayer14> this kills the bitrate
[2:51:38] <gslayer14> good
[2:51:38] <%Zero_Jacks> its him, rage raven from the metal gear
[2:51:39] <Fluffy_Tamamo> Aww damn easy master rounds right?
[2:51:45] <IamGrapes> YOU FOOL NOOOO
[2:51:45] <linSP> bye extra health
[2:51:55] <Saltmeisterr> crown seems much better for room clearing
[2:51:56] <%gitgouda> that no felt so good to hear. is this why people like asmr?
[2:51:59] <%Garthunox> you have the master round from here tho right?
[2:52:05] <%Dr_DangerPhD> crown of guns with remote control bullets is pretty good
[2:52:10] <acsn88> I really don't like the crown
[2:52:11] <DrkJP520> Too stronk to see
[2:52:11] <$valkuma> you can double up garth
[2:52:11] <%Garthunox> you cant get 2 master rounds of the same type
[2:52:13] <%dork_doggler> @Garthunox esets master rounds
[2:52:23] <gslayer14> @Garthunox wrong, you can
[2:52:29] <%dork_doggler> @Garthunox you can, i've done it
[2:52:42] <%Garthunox> oh damn
[2:52:46] <%Garthunox> didnt know that
[2:52:51] <$valkuma> this gun is reaping shit.
[2:53:09] <gslayer14> it does indeed, fuck.
[2:53:09] <LorcaNomad> also at boss damage
[2:53:09] <%dork_doggler> Would you say it's... bussin'?
[2:53:13] <Saltmeisterr> ac is great
[2:53:33] <Saltmeisterr> this seems like a crown room
[2:53:40] <linSP> bussy
[2:53:42] <%valriot> Bussy Gun
[2:53:44] <%Chichen> what
[2:53:44] <%swesterly> SHeeeeeeSh
[2:53:46] <+FoolsArcade> @PatStaresAt Busing tables
[2:53:49] <gslayer14> bussin' makes me feel good
[2:53:57] <benjiFG> this gun ejaculates
[2:54:01] <DeliveryPig> Basing say
[2:54:03] <$Ziegsy> @gslayer14 dammit you beat me to it
[2:54:11] <leinadtonu> basedand red pilled gun
[2:54:12] <Saltmeisterr> was that a mic chest?
[2:54:18] <Saltmeisterr> mimic*
[2:55:02] <%Chichen> either way its content
[2:55:13] <$valkuma> this gun is trivializing the first 3 floors for sure
[2:55:25] <Devbob98> Don’t embarrass yourself in front of gief
[2:55:38] <TheTakkster> Can the clone appear twice?
[2:55:40] <+Ellroy2> oh fuck yes i came over at the right time
[2:55:48] <+BusterRepukken> i walk into the stream and hear 'this thing fucks so much ass'
[2:55:59] <%the22cstomp> @TheTakkster it can appear a lot
[2:56:00] <+Ellroy2> this game consumed my life recently
[2:56:05] <Saltmeisterr> OH YES IT CAN
[2:56:06] <%AzureGale> Chain clone runs, become stronk
[2:56:06] <$valkuma> theres other clone effects that can appear as well
[2:56:06] <DrkJP520> It'll be interesting to see the playtime for this run.
[2:56:10] <linSP> you can have an infinite run
[2:56:12] <$valkuma> there are 3 or 4 clonelike effects i think
[2:56:12] <%the22cstomp> i watched someone do a 3 or 4 clone run that took 10 hours
[2:56:17] <%Ne1son> Flashbacks to Malf's 8 hough rainbow chest run where he kept getting clones
[2:56:19] <%dork_doggler> Pat, you watch ClayGod? Does Gungeon meme videos. Has one about getting clones like three times consecutively.
[2:56:20] <gslayer14> chance of getting it twice is astronomically low
[2:56:28] <gslayer14> unless you do a rainbow run
[2:56:29] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt Up your coolness, increases chances of black chests
[2:56:37] <%arcielardor> how can you tell if it's a mimic?
[2:56:47] <%dork_doggler> Gunslinger himself is so busted it doesn't matter
[2:56:48] <%yet_another_brony> ive done multiple clone runs with rainbow run
[2:56:57] <%valriot> Guunslinger is busted tho
[2:56:58] <CrimsonFox777> Nice save
[2:57:00] <%the22cstomp> it has a subtle breathing animation @arcielardor
[2:57:06] <$valkuma> that explosion slowdown has saved you multiple times
[2:57:12] <%Agami23> @arcielardor opens its mouth and looks around, and when you shoot it it shoots back
[2:57:12] <%yet_another_brony> well you might lose these but the gunslingers passive more than makes up for it
[2:57:16] <%Dr_DangerPhD> gun soul is also nice to get, not as good as clone though
[2:57:25] <+unfamous2423> Does he have super hot?
[2:57:28] <benjiFG> what if pat gets the cactus with gunslinger
[2:57:34] <gslayer14> honestly gunslinger *is* this busted
[2:57:38] <lemon_lover28> I am unfamiliar with him
[2:57:44] <lemon_lover28> oh. That is crazy
[2:57:44] <$valkuma> thats fucking broken
[2:57:48] <DianaTheAscian> wtf thats crazy
[2:57:48] <gslayer14> all gun based synergies
[2:57:53] <gslayer14> no item synergies
[2:57:59] <Brandon__Brando> holy shit
[2:57:59] <%yet_another_brony> its great
[2:58:00] <CrimsonFox777> nice
[2:58:04] <%the22cstomp> but it also takes a shit ton of effort to unlock so it's deserved
[2:58:10] <gslayer14> still OP as fuck
[2:58:13] <%valriot> Remember you'll need a key for Old King
[2:58:15] <leinadtonu> I know very little about this game, why does Pat ignore the chests?
[2:58:19] <%yet_another_brony> no i think it includes item based synergies on guns
[2:58:22] <%CatzkyGuy> Makes sense for how late you get him into the game
[2:58:22] <%Garthunox> all synergies?
[2:58:26] <$valkuma> goodbye boss hp
[2:58:30] <%yet_another_brony> just no item synergy on items
[2:58:41] <%Ne1son> No mastertound from this boss
[2:58:45] <%Ne1son> anyway
[2:58:49] <+gutlesscoward> this one has no master round
[2:58:49] <%Urgotfantasy> Urgotfantasy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[2:58:53] <+SilverStasis> you gotta use them blanks
[2:58:56] <Saltmeisterr> Blob doesn't give a master round
[2:58:58] <LegitBarnacleBoy> this boss don't got a master round
[2:59:01] <lemon_lover28> @yet_another_brony can he not get item synergies or does he just not get them automatically?
[2:59:02] <Meltgar> Does this guy even give master round?
[2:59:06] <Saltmeisterr> non of the alt floor bosses do
[2:59:09] <gslayer14> it happens
[2:59:11] <%Urgotfantasy> assrage
[2:59:21] <%dork_doggler> @yet_another_brony he is not excluded from item synergy
[2:59:21] <%yet_another_brony> just not automatic
[2:59:25] <%AzureGale> It's fine, you were fighting in the most bullshit room for the Gatling Gull
[2:59:30] <%yet_another_brony> fair synergies still happen
[2:59:31] <$valkuma> it looks a little more than okay with the flak bullets
[2:59:35] <gslayer14> ice breaker bad because you have so much other stuff, lol
[2:59:36] <+gutlesscoward> sick
[2:59:37] <%valriot> YEAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
[2:59:39] <linSP> nice
[2:59:43] <Saltmeisterr> YEYE
[2:59:45] <%valriot> COOL MODE
[2:59:47] <DrkJP520> Can't get master round from any boss that's not on one of the 5 main floors
[2:59:48] <Saltmeisterr> CRIT GUN
[2:59:48] <%ArchimerCXV> vorpal's great with high coolness
[2:59:50] <lloyddboy> this one's another tap gun
[2:59:52] <%MelBrooksKA> Was that a mother fuckin Titanic reference?
[3:00:09] <%dork_doggler> tap gun? you mean semi-auto?
[3:00:21] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt btw coolness increases vorpals crit rate
[3:00:22] <linSP> i do like a good vorpal
[3:00:38] <IamGrapes> does Vorpal kill the dragun better, by chance?
[3:00:50] <%valriot> Vorpal has big potential if you get more coolness
[3:00:51] <DrkJP520> Vorpal is a fun one
[3:00:56] <$valkuma> keep using the Anal Conqueror-13
[3:01:14] <%valriot> blessed run
[3:01:14] <Saltmeisterr> YES
[3:01:17] <linSP> nice
[3:01:18] <%dork_doggler> @IamGrapes vorpal has no interaction with dragun
[3:01:19] <+gutlesscoward> yeah
[3:01:20] <%AzureGale> You. Did it.
[3:01:27] <$Ziegsy> ishguard fetes start in 37 mins

[3:01:28] <Devbob98> He happy
[3:01:42] <IamGrapes> @IamGrapes bummer
[3:01:43] <BlueLunecy> Imagine losing the shield and THEN finding out it was right there
[3:01:53] <%dork_doggler> Or that bullet that gives you damage for each floor explored
[3:02:01] <DrkJP520> Just don't forget that you opened that passage like I do half the time.
[3:02:02] <LegitBarnacleBoy> sell poopy guns

[3:07:09] <%Buzzard42> HUGE boss damage
[3:07:15] <$valkuma> its slightly more accurate from the medal
[3:07:15] <%dork_doggler> Less spread it sdeems?
[3:07:18] <DrkJP520> You can leave a fight with the teleporter, but I'm not sure if bosses will forget the damage they've dealt to you
[3:07:23] <gslayer14> crown will have much higher damage, i think
[3:07:25] <Nohorse> Isn't it like 25$
[3:07:30] <Nohorse> 25% sorry
[3:07:31] <gslayer14> due to damage cap removal
[3:07:31] <%AzureGale> Also reloads faster and makes spread smaller
[3:07:36] <$valkuma> crown will melt bosses probably
[3:07:57] <$spardanwarrior> 30% bonus damage to bosses, reduces spread, halves reload time
[3:08:05] <%Ne1son> Chicken arise
[3:08:05] <Nohorse> The crown becomes busted with enough accuracy upgrades
[3:08:05] <acsn88> 30%, halves reload time, halves bullet spread

[3:37:09] <%Urgotfantasy> electrochemistry disliked that
[3:37:13] <acsn88> sell yari
[3:37:17] <DudeDern> Sell the bees
[3:37:19] <Fluffy_Tamamo> You heard it here, Pats off the drugs
[3:37:23] <DrkJP520> Don't use heroin, kids
[3:37:26] <Who_lio42> never drop bees
[3:37:33] <raikagelord1> Samus can be good with synergy’s
[3:37:41] <LorcaNomad> Heroine is really only good if you're extra patient which in gungeon is bad
[3:37:50] <%Amarshtomp> Hi Pat!!
[3:37:52] <LorcaNomad> PogChamp
[3:37:52] <%valriot> Ok LUL
[3:37:57] <%Dakuu75> did castlesuperbeast get rid of the "one guy" emote?
[3:38:03] <LorcaNomad> GUN KNIGHT HERE WE COME
[3:38:07] <%Dakuu75> or was that woolie's?
[3:38:08] <gslayer14> bit late for gunknight, but could you imagine?
[3:38:08] <+bassforte123> Heroinie is good as a starter gun since it's very ammo efficient
[3:38:21] <%Chichen> pat this is a really funny sponsored stream where they give you cheats
[3:38:21] <Jaysky> One Guy emote is Woolz
[3:38:22] <%Chichen> right?
[3:38:31] <Lucid_Dynamic> You should have found the secret room before junking that chest.
[3:38:35] <%Dakuu75> @Jaysky gotchya, thanks
[3:38:38] <Lucid_Dynamic> It could contain a key.
[3:38:41] <TheresAGoff> Is the slowdown because of how much shit is on screen when you shoot? XD
[3:38:59] <%Chichen> @TheresAGoff he has an item that when explosions happen, it slows down time
[3:39:00] <%ArchimerCXV> isaac logic: look for rooms with obvious space for corridors to adjacent rooms
[3:39:04] <Saltmeisterr> its always on the edge
[3:39:04] <$valkuma> to the bottom right
[3:39:05] <%ArchimerCXV> always
[3:39:06] <gslayer14> yes
[3:39:08] <DrkJP520> Just a random chicken lol
[3:39:09] <benjiFG> i don't think so
[3:39:09] <+bassforte123> typically 1, but can be 0 or 2
[3:39:14] <Saltmeisterr> check the key shop
[3:39:15] <$valkuma> oh nvm that was trap room
[3:39:22] <$spardanwarrior> One per floor, could be in the exit room too fyi
[3:39:23] <LegitBarnacleBoy> can be 0
[3:39:26] <lloyddboy> after boss?
[3:39:33] <Saltmeisterr> key ship might have it
[3:39:38] <Saltmeisterr> shop*
[3:39:41] <LorcaNomad> could be in the first room too
[3:39:56] <+bassforte123> Don't you have to shoot walls to check for cracks?
[3:40:06] <Saltmeisterr> key shop pat
[3:40:09] <DrkJP520> Checked the shop?
[3:40:10] <%dork_doggler> omg you haven't uinlocked all the elevetaor man levels yet
[3:40:11] <Saltmeisterr> the key shop
[3:40:13] <%ArchimerCXV> @bassforte123 he has an item that'll highlight it
[3:40:22] <Lucid_Dynamic> @bassforte123 He has Brick of Cash.
[3:40:23] <LegitBarnacleBoy> @bassforte123 he's got an item that reveals them
[3:40:26] <gslayer14> weird
[3:40:27] <+KattAndSteven> the brick of cash bribes the secret room into showing itself
[3:40:27] <Nohorse> @PatStaresAt
[3:40:32] <+bassforte123> Oh right, I missed he got the brick, nice
[3:40:36] <Nohorse> Pat, it IS possible for a floor to NOT HAVE a secret room
[3:40:43] <Saltmeisterr> rip
[3:40:47] <Nohorse> Though that's a bit rare
[3:40:59] <Who_lio42> wish it would just show up on the mat
[3:41:24] <gslayer14> btw i'd treat stuffed star like blank, because of ice cube
[3:41:29] <gslayer14> it's too free
[3:41:33] <%Dakuu75> I like the guns that don't require me to aim, lol
[3:41:39] <Saltmeisterr> ^
[3:41:46] <Saltmeisterr> what gslayer said
[3:42:01] <$valkuma> the unfortunate part about playing as the galaxy character too
[3:42:20] <%dork_doggler> all the girls are watching, patr
[3:42:21] <%Agami23> oh god, i forgot he had stuffed star
[3:42:24] <LorcaNomad> the music definitely doesn't help
[3:42:28] <%dork_doggler> it's bad
[3:42:31] <gslayer14> kiln worst
[3:42:32] <gslayer14> no get
[3:42:33] <%ArchimerCXV> gun that fires pots
[3:42:33] <lloyddboy> shoot pot
[3:42:33] <LegitBarnacleBoy> kiln is poo
[3:42:34] <Who_lio42> i would just start burning through my weaker guns here
[3:42:35] <gslayer14> bad
[3:42:37] <benjiFG> bad
[3:42:37] <Nohorse> The Kilm? it's trash
[3:42:38] <%Agami23> dont go in the kiln!
[3:42:39] <%valriot> SAVE AMMO FOR YARI AFTER BOSS
[3:42:39] <%Ne1son> the kiln is not good
[3:42:40] <Who_lio42> DONT GET IN THE KILN
[3:42:42] <%holydeviant1> IT SHOOTS POTS
[3:42:43] <acsn88> save money for that ammo after dragun
[3:42:44] <LorcaNomad> Kiln is bad sadly
[3:42:44] <DrkJP520> Kiln sucks
[3:42:45] <+bassforte123> big trash
[3:42:47] <+SilverStasis> its awful
[3:42:47] <lloyddboy> GET IT 420
[3:42:55] <%Garthunox> DONT GET IN THE KILN!
[3:42:55] <DudeDern> Forgetting your active item is part of the gungeon experience
[3:42:59] <lloyddboy> GET KILN
[3:42:59] <%Garthunox> GET OUTTA THE KILN
[3:43:00] <badabingbox> get it dawg
[3:43:03] <gslayer14> flak kiln would be funny though
[3:43:06] <LegitBarnacleBoy> merchant got ammo, so dragon getting YEEETED
[3:43:06] <Nohorse> I can't believe Pat has become big dick Gungeon master PogChamp
[3:43:08] <raikagelord1> Klin is really bad
[3:43:23] <Lucid_Dynamic> The other gun synergizes with muscle relaxant.  Take that into account.
[3:43:24] <DudeDern> Can pat grab bullet?
[3:43:47] <%dork_doggler> try anyway, for the lulz
[3:44:11] <%dork_doggler> yes
[3:44:13] <%Ne1son> yes
[3:44:13] <LorcaNomad> yes
[3:44:13] <$spardanwarrior> Yes
[3:44:14] <Lucid_Dynamic> Yes
[3:44:14] <benjiFG> yep
[3:44:15] <%ArchimerCXV> byeah
[3:44:15] <Nohorse> Yes
[3:44:16] <Flakari> Yeah
[3:44:16] <+SilverStasis> yes
[3:44:16] <LegitBarnacleBoy> yes
[3:44:18] <+lifeles21> yes
[3:44:18] <Saltmeisterr> yes
[3:44:19] <Nohorse> That would be the play
[3:44:21] <Who_lio42> yES
[3:44:23] <leto_ii_muadibadder> 😯
[3:44:29] <RogueMinja> Yes.
[3:44:35] <%Caped_Eggy> Has pat never beat lich?
[3:44:47] <%dork_doggler> that's how you inlock paradox
[3:44:59] <DudeDern> Made Pat get hit, time to commit seppuku
[3:45:00] <Nohorse> Yeah isn't that how you unlock it
[3:45:03] <Fluffy_Tamamo> So this'll be first slinger run?
[3:45:08] <lloyddboy> pat just have star on all the time
[3:45:13] <TheresAGoff> Use your invincibility more often you coward
[3:45:23] <%holydeviant1> The reason the Paradox can't get the Bullet is because Bullet Hell,well, technically IS his past
[3:45:24] <JUNNNKEN> dont you just have to do his past to unlock gunslinger?
[3:45:25] <DrkJP520> What do you get for winning a paradox? Was it gunslinger?
[3:45:29] <%holydeviant1> He's a paradox, geddit
[3:45:32] <%Caped_Eggy> He called me edgy lionStop
[3:45:33] <Nohorse> KappaPride
[3:45:50] <%dork_doggler> @DrkJP520 you clear lich with paradox thenj again consecutively with slinger to unlock gunslinger
[3:46:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> The floating guns are so glitchy I love it
[3:46:06] <%dork_doggler> if you fail you have to clear with paradox again
[3:46:07] <$valkuma> it doesnt help that all the purple balls are almost the same color as your character
[3:46:18] <%Urgotfantasy> lionNice
[3:46:23] <LorcaNomad> ew chaff
[3:46:31] <DrkJP520> Right, that's how it works
[3:46:34] <%ArchimerCXV> yep
[3:46:34] <+SilverStasis> yes
[3:46:35] <%Blackmage9999> 100%
[3:46:35] <+lifeles21> yes
[3:46:35] <gslayer14> yup
[3:46:35] <linSP> yes

[3:46:37] <%Ne1son> yes
[3:46:38] <%dork_doggler> M1 is kinda nice tbh you have the money
[3:46:39] <%AzureGale> That's a good idea
[3:46:39] <gslayer14> don't need guns
[3:46:39] <%holydeviant1> YAR
[3:46:39] <%Agami23> yeah
[3:46:41] <Who_lio42> yes
[3:46:48] <RogueMinja> Yes.
[3:46:49] <LorcaNomad> use AC for second phase yea
[3:46:51] <LegitBarnacleBoy> that not the boss
[3:46:55] <%AzureGale> WELP

[3:47:43] <Nohorse> Oh yeah, Pat, the crown gets BUSTED if you collect enough accuracy upgrades
[3:47:43] <+lifeles21> shit
[3:47:45] <$valkuma> as long as you can keep track of yourself crown is the best
[3:47:45] <%holydeviant1> in this thread we stan A CROWN
[3:47:46] <DudeDern> Best gun in the game
[3:47:47] <pixelkingu> best weapon
[3:48:02] <pixelkingu> its like no even fair

[3:48:05] <%dork_doggler> yari all the way
[3:48:05] <linSP> yari
[3:48:08] <+SilverStasis> crown
[3:48:08] <$valkuma> for the boss? yaris
[3:48:09] <benjiFG> yari bypasses the dps cap
[3:48:09] <Nohorse> The crown gets cucked by the DPS cap, Pat
[3:48:09] <gslayer14> both are god
[3:48:09] <%holydeviant1> crown is now a beast
[3:48:10] <%ArchimerCXV> yari phase 1 crown phase 2
[3:48:11] <+lifeles21> yari
[3:48:11] <Lucid_Dynamic> Minibosses have no damage per second cap
[3:48:14] <badabingbox> yari
[3:48:14] <%dork_doggler> the crown for heart
[3:48:15] <+bassforte123> yari goes throuhg dps cap
[3:48:18] <$spardanwarrior> Yari to start, crown for phase 2
[3:48:18] <LorcaNomad> Yari for phase 1 something else for phase 2
[3:48:20] <+lifeles21> crown still gets dps capped
[3:48:20] <Who_lio42> Toyota Yaris?
[3:48:22] <jfp4life> crown 1 yari 2
[3:48:22] <LegitBarnacleBoy> back 1, crown 2
[3:48:23] <acsn88> crown has DPS cap, yari does not
[3:48:26] <DrkJP520> Yari ignores boss dmg cap
[3:48:26] <$valkuma> Anything for heart, Yari for p1
[3:48:30] <lemon_lover28> is the yari just like the de facto best weapon?
[3:48:47] <Nohorse> DON'T CHOKE Kappa
[3:49:07] <benjiFG> now use crown
[3:49:17] <gslayer14> lol
[3:49:24] <+bassforte123> Yari's very bad ammo wise, so it's good for bosses but bad in rooms

[3:49:59] <DudeDern> He’s a solar system of bullets
[3:50:00] <Manwad> why not
[3:50:00] <LorcaNomad> Oh btw secret room is on the map @PatStaresAt
[3:50:02] <%Blackmage9999> nah
[3:50:02] <+SilverStasis> no
[3:50:03] <$valkuma> you need nothing lol
[3:50:04] <Nohorse> You got a shitton of room clearers already
[3:50:05] <Saltmeisterr> NO
[3:50:05] <%Ne1son> yeah sure
[3:50:05] <benjiFG> it's good but does it matter at this point
[3:50:05] <%dork_doggler> i like it
[3:50:05] <lemon_lover28> @bassforte123 makes sense, just saw that he used literally all its ammo there
[3:50:06] <+lifeles21> no point
[3:50:13] <Saltmeisterr> secret room pat
[3:50:14] <Who_lio42> nah youre fine
[3:50:14] <RogueMinja> Nah.
[3:50:23] <%Garthunox> yeah
[3:50:24] <%josstil> Talk to lady?
[3:50:53] <+ascii3647> shoot chest
[3:50:55] <LorcaNomad> armor for days hell yeah
[3:50:57] <%dork_doggler> not the BEES
[3:50:59] <$valkuma> you can open secrets with your void cannon
[3:51:00] <gslayer14> wait for map full clear
[3:51:13] <Devbob98> You still have more of map
[3:51:15] <Saltmeisterr> oh ye
[3:51:43] <DrkJP520> There are more rooms to fight through. Might get keys
[3:52:01] <pixelkingu> Pat has become the walking gun god
[3:52:11] <Devbob98> You skipped a room
[3:52:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Pat has become the Touhou boss
[3:52:19] <LorcaNomad> Imagine if chamber gun though
[3:52:29] <Saltmeisterr> i know how to navigate bullet hell right pat?
[3:52:30] <Jaysky> Imagine the drop is instant death
[3:52:31] <+SilverStasis> the only thing your missing is the bullet throne
[3:52:42] <$valkuma> 6 armors lol
[3:52:46] <Saltmeisterr> ye
[3:52:48] <Nohorse> You pick a direction and go
[3:52:49] <+FierceDeityGabe> Don't get hit
[3:52:52] <Nohorse> Not joking
[3:52:52] <%SirGO0SE> be careful :)
[3:52:53] <Saltmeisterr> go left
[3:52:56] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt shoot things till they die
[3:53:01] <Jaysky> Make sure to pet the dog
[3:53:01] <%baka_sugoi> don't die
[3:53:02] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> dont get shoot
[3:53:05] <+bassforte123> Bullet hell is like deliberately long.  It has branches that dead end so if you find a long path, don't backtrack
[3:53:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Try to avoid dying, that's a good trick
[3:53:06] <Nohorse> It's as far as possible in ONE direction
[3:53:07] <Lucid_Dynamic> Two of the first three paths reconnect.  That is the correct direction.
[3:53:08] <Saltmeisterr> look for paths that don't connect
[3:53:10] <badabingbox> if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a bullet
[3:53:18] <Nohorse> Unless you hit a dead-end, don't turn back
[3:53:19] <raikagelord1> Shoot enemies
[3:53:22] <gslayer14> there will always be false spin offs
[3:53:28] <Louie_Salmon> Moving to where bullets just were is usually a good idea. If a the bullets were just somewhere, they probably won't be there for a few seconds.
[3:53:32] <+ThomasOfTroy> Don't sin and get into bullet heaven instead
[3:53:38] <Saltmeisterr> dead end
[3:53:51] <gslayer14> a m m o
[3:53:52] <lloyddboy> pat is the bullet hell
[3:53:58] <LorcaNomad> doggo the best
[3:53:59] <Nohorse> Dead end means it's not in this direction
[3:54:00] <%bmoral64> Don't forget about your invul
[3:54:09] <LorcaNomad> the music does not help AT ALL
[3:54:11] <DianaTheAscian> well it is hell
[3:54:20] <Saltmeisterr> CatJAM
[3:54:35] <Devbob98> Who knew hell was stressful?
[3:54:38] <Nohorse> Imagine a straight line from the starting elevator, try to follow it
[3:54:41] <Saltmeisterr> looks like the right path
[3:54:49] <Saltmeisterr> ok go bottom right pat
[3:54:51] <benjiFG> imagine if you had the hungry bullets
[3:54:55] <Saltmeisterr> yep yep
[3:55:18] <DudeDern> Don’t forget to pet the dog
[3:55:23] <Nohorse> Come on, Pat, you got 24 hits before you die
[3:55:26] <Nohorse> You'll be right
[3:55:37] <%dork_doggler> Dodge roll THIS assholes
[3:55:48] <Jaysky> Oh he'll be right alright, until he isn't and he's dead.
[3:55:55] <+bassforte123> I'm watching these men get washed away in a sea of bullets and questioning how Surf can miss
[3:55:55] <Devbob98> I literally can’t see enemy shots now
[3:55:59] <LegitBarnacleBoy> :)
[3:56:00] <Nohorse> LUL
[3:56:02] <gslayer14> shop discount in hell
[3:56:04] <gslayer14> fitting
[3:56:04] <LorcaNomad> Remember, crown bullets can go far
[3:56:05] <pixelkingu> this is full clenched buttcheeks
[3:56:16] <Nohorse> M E L T I N G Pog
[3:56:22] <Jaysky> Yeah with this game I get distracted by my own shots
[3:56:28] <Lucid_Dynamic> At the second intersection, that path which does not rejoin the other two leads to forward progress.
[3:56:38] <Saltmeisterr> up i say
[3:56:42] <%xmetalicdemonx> xmetalicdemonx subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Hey pat love the streams. Keep up the good work and pet the babies for all of us.
[3:56:53] <Saltmeisterr> yep go back pat
[3:56:54] <DudeDern> Pat is playing really well
[3:57:02] <Saltmeisterr> and then go up
[3:57:08] <Jaysky> Something I do enjoy with this game however is the gun animations on the bottom right
[3:57:20] <Saltmeisterr> this loops back
[3:57:25] <lloyddboy> pet dog
[3:57:30] <%bmoral64> psaDogchamp Go Pat Go! psaDogchamp
[3:57:36] <gslayer14> check map
[3:57:38] <+bassforte123> The gun animations are fantastic for how many of them there are
[3:57:54] <Saltmeisterr> yep pat is going the wrong direction
[3:58:10] <gslayer14> like the voids
[3:58:11] <Lucid_Dynamic> Go the other way.
[3:58:12] <$valkuma> dont go next room
[3:58:21] <%dork_doggler> it';s gonna loop bakc
[3:58:24] <$valkuma> go up from that big square maybe
[3:58:27] <gslayer14> up maybe
[3:58:29] <Lucid_Dynamic> At the second intersection, that path which does not rejoin the other two leads to forward progress
[3:58:29] <+xiccy> keep going
[3:58:31] <Saltmeisterr> ok to the big room then up
[3:58:32] <%dork_doggler> yeah
[3:58:32] <Nohorse> It's in a semi-STRAIGHT line from the elevator @PatStaresAt
[3:58:37] <Saltmeisterr> yep
[3:58:39] <Nohorse> Don't curve
[3:58:56] <Jaysky> Curve the bullet not the rooms
[3:59:08] <Saltmeisterr> basically u navigate bullet hell with a high shivers stat
[3:59:22] <$valkuma> straightish
[3:59:28] <$valkuma> this will keep going rightish
[3:59:30] <%xmetalicdemonx> Nah that curved straight line
[3:59:33] <CrimsonFox777> Semi-linear might be a better term.
[3:59:41] <Fluffy_Tamamo> veiS
[3:59:46] <+bassforte123> It means the boss shouldn't be at like a loop back toward the elevator, so if the rooms are pointing backwards it's the wrong path
[3:59:57] <Louie_Salmon> It's isaac rules, the boss room is as far from the start as it can get
[4:00:00] <DudeDern> Fuck yeah magic
[4:00:02] <Nohorse> Honestly with this run it won't hurt to full-clear anyway LUL
[4:00:23] <LorcaNomad> Secret room get
[4:00:24] <Saltmeisterr> ok uh
[4:00:26] <Nohorse> Yeah that's a better way of putting it, it's as far as possible (which tends to be a straight line)
[4:00:26] <Jaysky> With how nervous Pat is I think a full clear could be dangerous
[4:00:34] <+digital_gambitt> Its always left, always right, always down, but only one of those.
[4:00:37] <CrimsonFox777> Were those cosmic panthers or something?
[4:00:37] <acsn88> don't forget your active item
[4:00:47] <gslayer14> member the star
[4:00:48] <TheresAGoff> Dont hog the invuln
[4:00:50] <%ArchimerCXV> giga muncher
[4:00:51] <%ArchimerCXV> 10 guns
[4:00:52] <lloyddboy> DEVIL MUNCHER
[4:00:52] <lemon_lover28> this synergy is just visually appalling, so hard to see what is going on
[4:00:53] <benjiFG> fuck that
[4:00:54] <gslayer14> egh
[4:00:55] <%ArchimerCXV> big rare output
[4:00:56] <Nohorse> EVIL muncher WutFace
[4:00:56] <%Ne1son> HELL MUncher
[4:01:00] <%bmoral64> Use your invul pat!
[4:01:12] <Nohorse> I never found it worth it, the evil mucher
[4:01:49] <Nohorse> If I'm in hell in the first place, I don't NEED any more powerful weapons, much less at a cost of like 6-8 guns
[4:01:53] <%ArchimerCXV> dead end...
[4:01:54] <gslayer14> ded end
[4:01:55] <gslayer14> oof
[4:01:59] <Saltmeisterr> nope
[4:02:02] <Devbob98> Crazy talk
[4:02:12] <%ArchimerCXV> hey a key for that chest
[4:02:14] <LorcaNomad> key lol
[4:02:24] <gslayer14> it happens
[4:02:24] <$valkuma> right from the room halfway up
[4:02:26] <LorcaNomad> ew
[4:02:26] <%Chichen> why would you listen to us lmao
[4:02:28] <Nohorse> Further right
[4:02:30] <%ArchimerCXV> another one for the gun muncher
[4:02:30] <$valkuma> maybe
[4:02:31] <Nohorse> The direction is correct
[4:02:34] <%holydeviant1> Ha, the gun from Gunner
[4:02:34] <vile_brand> but you didnt have to listen to us pat
[4:02:36] <Louie_Salmon> I mean there's still more to go that way
[4:02:39] <Devbob98> Try up right
[4:02:40] <Lucid_Dynamic> At the first intersection, two of the paths reconnect, and branch off into forward progress.  At the second intersection, the two of the paths reconnect, however, the path that does not combine with them is forward progress.  The third intersection is random.
[4:02:41] <Saltmeisterr> id say go top right
[4:02:52] <Who_lio42> bees
[4:03:02] <CrimsonFox777> Imagine thinking a large number of people are right.
[4:03:16] <+Sendrak70> I say we call Paige and ask her which way to go.
[4:03:26] <DrkJP520> I dunno. i've got a good feeling about left
[4:03:34] <gslayer14> this is ONE GUY ACT TWO: MANY GUYS
[4:03:35] <%bmoral64> Paige will guess the direction correctluy
[4:03:36] <%ArchimerCXV> now munch garbage guns
[4:03:37] <%AzureGale> THIS IS IT
[4:03:38] <Saltmeisterr> aye
[4:03:39] <$valkuma> ^ LUL
[4:03:40] <%Agami23> kill
[4:03:40] <DrkJP520> Nvm
[4:03:42] <lloyddboy> SAVE yari
[4:03:42] <%dork_doggler> last phase
[4:03:42] <pixelkingu> YES,
[4:03:45] <Saltmeisterr> gl pat
[4:03:45] <%AzureGale> DEATH OR GLORY
[4:03:46] <DegenCat> woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE woolieYE
[4:03:46] <%Ne1son> Yari for phase 2
[4:03:50] <gslayer14> yari on stage 2
[4:03:50] <benjiFG> eh fuck it
[4:03:51] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> psa1guy was right
[4:03:53] <%dork_doggler> last, yes
[4:03:54] <LorcaNomad> second
[4:03:54] <%charp35> last probably
[4:03:55] <LegitBarnacleBoy> 2nd phase
[4:03:55] <Saltmeisterr> phase 2
[4:03:58] <gslayer14> 2
[4:03:58] <jfp4life> give the muncher your trash guns first
[4:03:59] <Manwad> phase 2 and 3
[4:03:59] <%valriot> Smaller phases
[4:04:00] <%dork_doggler> i guess two, actually
[4:04:01] <asylumkon> second
[4:04:02] <Lucid_Dynamic> Personally, phase 2 is hardest for me.
[4:04:03] <JUNNNKEN> id say 2
[4:04:04] <%AzureGale> GO FOR BROKE
[4:04:04] <DTimelines> Yari Launcher for Phase 2
[4:04:05] <LorcaNomad> We know but phase 2 is the fuckiest
[4:04:09] <gslayer14> 2 sucks the most
[4:04:10] <$spardanwarrior> Whichever phase gives you the most trouble
[4:04:12] <%Treuan> stage 2 makes sense, you may have some left over for phase 3
[4:04:14] <+xiccy> phase 12
[4:04:15] <%skeletonman9000> phase 2
[4:04:15] <Smokin_Fish> -1
[4:04:19] <LorcaNomad> phase 3 is easy with rockets
[4:04:23] <xeros720> good thing you have so much hp then
[4:04:25] <%dork_doggler> 2 is apparently the fuckesyt stage
[4:04:26] <+bassforte123> stage 2 has worse attacks but stage 3 is smaller so homing helps
[4:04:27] <benjiFG> you got this
[4:04:29] <pixelkingu> it starts
[4:04:31] <JUNNNKEN> big head use yari
[4:04:31] <LorcaNomad> bullet erasure makes phase 3 a joke
[4:04:32] <pixelkingu> you can do it pat
[4:04:42] <Lucid_Dynamic> Dodge roll obliquely for his wave attack.
[4:04:48] <%josstil> Git Gud

[4:05:19] <Nohorse> You got this, dude, make him your bitch SwiftRage
[4:05:21] <+ascii3647> 2nd phase is the worst in my opinion
[4:05:23] <Jaysky> Yare yare launcher
[4:05:25] <$valkuma> wait for his hp bar dont hit him while invincible
[4:05:25] <+faytthepally> Lich?  More like bitch.

[4:07:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Round 2, baby
[4:07:17] <LegitBarnacleBoy> this starting gun is better than half the guns lmao
[4:07:17] <%holydeviant1> The Real Dark Souls Starts Here.
[4:07:17] <+RyTYoung> Now the real Demon's Souls begins...
[4:07:19] <%ArchimerCXV> you gonna be real slow

[4:07:24] <%baka_sugoi> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp psaDab
[4:07:25] <%YakumoYomi> Now do it again
[4:07:25] <Devbob98> This is going be tough
[4:07:28] <+bassforte123> BIG SLINGER
[4:07:28] <LorcaNomad> his passive is gamebreaking
[4:07:29] <DianaTheAscian> LUL
[4:07:32] <Nohorse> The best item in the entire game
[4:07:33] <scrumbotime> Every Fucking Synergy
[4:07:35] <gusdabus91> good luck dude
[4:07:39] <Nohorse> ACTUALLY gamebreaking
[4:07:42] <LorcaNomad> passive gives all guns their synergies
[4:07:43] <DrkJP520> Run comin' up on what? 3 hours
[4:07:45] <DegenCat> The Gunslinger by Tediore.
[4:07:46] <gslayer14> tap fire
[4:07:46] <+FoolsArcade> neat
[4:07:47] <lloyddboy> GUNYEETER
[4:07:48] <televisedrevolting> Gun Slinger
[4:07:49] <$spardanwarrior> The thrown gun can stun
[4:07:50] <%ArchimerCXV> i lvoe his mimic poncho
[4:07:58] <+ostrichsenpai> no way you fail this run :)
[4:08:03] <Nohorse> Biggest tip is to prioritize guns over passives on this dude @PatStaresAt
[4:08:07] <gusdabus91> RNG be with us
[4:08:07] <benjiFG> it shoots faster if you tap after rolling
[4:08:07] <%dork_doggler> You're probably going to have to beat the Lich for real this run
[4:08:10] <wolfen091> gunslinger automatically gets all synergies right?
[4:08:10] <LegitBarnacleBoy> starter guns a tapper
[4:08:11] <Lucid_Dynamic> You can shoot way faster than that.
[4:08:13] <+ascii3647> does he know about the gunslinger passive?
[4:08:14] <lemon_lover28> is the music different?
[4:08:16] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt might be best to skip oubliette
[4:08:27] <linSP> the watur!

[4:08:54] <linSP> noubliette :(
[4:09:06] <gslayer14> @Lucid_Dynamic he knows
[4:09:07] <%armandog143> psaGib psaGib psaGib
[4:09:11] <%Garthunox> probably best
[4:09:20] <cherrycottontail> Yeah, i also skipped ooblets
[4:09:24] <%bmoral64> what do the litch eye bullets do?
[4:09:33] <Nohorse> It's over NotLikeThis
[4:09:35] <DudeDern> Pat is a pro gamer he will be fine
[4:09:40] <DrkJP520> I'd say go for as many chambers as you can. You could still get shit guns
[4:09:43] <%Garthunox> synerfy with any gun
[4:09:47] <farrellcityking> Beautiful beautiful Elmo 🥺
[4:09:48] <gslayer14> it'd be funny if you instinctually reset
[4:09:48] <%Garthunox> synergy*
[4:09:55] <Nohorse> No gun is a shit gun on Lich
[4:10:00] <Smokin_Fish> Elmo given a look sayin "You sure about this?"
[4:10:03] <Saltmeisterr> take the chest
[4:10:12] <DudeDern> The starting gun seems good
[4:10:17] <Nohorse> Pat come on you're better than that LUL
[4:10:20] <%baka_sugoi> yet
[4:10:26] <LorcaNomad> Pat the passive gives all guns their synergies
[4:10:26] <JUNNNKEN> your starter is good, it can stun
[4:10:29] <gusdabus91> you just have to press the buttons really really good pat
[4:10:32] <%dork_doggler> @Nohorse no he's not, no one is
[4:10:35] <gslayer14> starting gun can carry you through first 2 floors
[4:10:36] <%skeletonman9000> obliette super not worth
[4:10:36] <+lifeles21> pray for 4 keys them @PatStaresAt
[4:10:37] <%AncelDeLambert> this looks like a pretty good starter, tho
[4:10:38] <%ArchimerCXV> hope we get something like Gunther to cap this off
[4:10:46] <%holydeviant1> Gunslinger does have a decent starting gun but his passive NEEDS something else
[4:10:48] <%Treuan> The throw can stun huh?
[4:10:54] <Lucid_Dynamic> Why is he firing so slowly?
[4:10:56] <gslayer14> if theres one in the shop...
[4:11:02] <%Buzzard42> catte

[4:14:39] <LegitBarnacleBoy> no synergy lol
[4:14:40] <Nohorse> DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A SYNERGY LUL
[4:14:43] <lloyddboy> OUB

[4:15:13] <scrumbotime> green
[4:15:15] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> oubli-nyet
[4:15:15] <linSP> more greens imo
[4:15:16] <%holydeviant1> Other green MUST be passive item / use item
[4:15:18] <LorcaNomad> green is an item
[4:15:19] <Blue_the_Fool2> Always Oub
[4:15:20] <Wagonobones> oub
[4:15:21] <gslayer14> guaranteed boss item
[4:15:22] <Lucid_Dynamic> The other chest is guaranteed to be an item and not a gun.
[4:15:23] <$valkuma> oubliette is 1.5 difficulty so if you think you can ace it
[4:15:23] <mar_krow> pat way better than me at gungeon
[4:15:23] <Blue_the_Fool2> Oub is easy
[4:15:23] <+icekept> no
[4:15:25] <%Ne1son> Abbey of true gun is not worth
[4:15:25] <Devbob98> Do poll lol
[4:15:26] <Saltmeisterr> green is either passive or active
[4:15:28] <Nohorse> The other chest is a passive, Slinger is all about guns
[4:15:33] <%AzureGale> Not bad
[4:15:34] <LorcaNomad> That's very good
[4:15:34] <Nohorse> BIG COWARDICE
[4:15:36] <DovaDude29> Break the chest, get trash for the trash mimic
[4:15:41] <JUNNNKEN> yes
[4:15:42] <benjiFG> ehhh
[4:15:43] <gslayer14> nah
[4:15:43] <%dork_doggler> why?
[4:15:44] <gslayer14> save
[4:15:44] <%holydeviant1> BABY
[4:15:47] <+lifeles21> chest friendship for mor chest
[4:15:49] <+ascii3647> yeah
[4:15:51] <%Treuan> Dababy
[4:15:53] <DrkJP520> Chest ring
[4:16:00] <LorcaNomad> baby only if you get familiars
[4:16:00] <Saltmeisterr> save
[4:16:04] <Nohorse> More chests
[4:16:04] <benjiFG> increases the chance for a chest to appear
[4:16:05] <gslayer14> up the drop rate of chest
[4:16:05] <holydeviant1> More chest drops
[4:16:05] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, I thought that was the anti-mimic one
[4:16:07] <$spardanwarrior> I'd save the key personally
[4:16:07] <+icekept> mor chest
[4:16:08] <%logoth_> psaWink psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[4:16:09] <lloyddboy> more random chests?
[4:16:10] <LegitBarnacleBoy> more chest drops after clearing rooms
[4:16:10] <LorcaNomad> chest friendship gives more chests
[4:16:15] <%ArchimerCXV> "Increases the chance of finding rewards upon clearing rooms. Doubles the chance of finding chests upon clearing rooms."
[4:16:21] <%dork_doggler> room clear increase chance for chest and/or item
[4:16:22] <Saltmeisterr> save the key
[4:16:23] <gslayer14> save honestly
[4:16:23] <+lifeles21> yea like when you clear a room and a random chest drops
[4:16:24] <Nohorse> That's only good if you got hella keys
[4:16:28] <+bassforte123> though room chests can also be locked
[4:16:29] <%SWFanatic> i like the baby mimic
[4:16:36] <$valkuma> baby mimic bad
[4:16:38] <%SWFanatic> but saving would also be ok
[4:16:38] <DudeDern> Mimic friendship makes them passive ai thought
[4:16:40] <%Ne1son> Which can mean more keys
[4:16:40] <%skeletonman9000> save key
[4:16:42] <DovaDude29> Get baby mimic
[4:16:51] <%ArchimerCXV> baby mimic can be baby gimmick depending if you get another minion
[4:16:58] <benjiFG> baby mimic good if you're actually gonna have companions
[4:17:01] <%ArchimerCXV> and what that minion is
[4:17:01] <%SWFanatic> baby mimic i'd say is fun, not necessarily a run maker
[4:17:10] <Nohorse> Slinger is practically unlosable, you'll be fiiiine SeemsGood
[4:17:10] <%logoth_> Just do it perfectly
[4:17:29] <cnry_m> Believe in the gun that believes in you Pat
[4:17:33] <LorcaNomad> starter gun is better than rub btw
[4:17:35] <%holydeviant1> instant chest drop lol
[4:17:42] <%SWFanatic> shoot up stupid
[4:17:54] <+ostrichsenpai> Has Pat unlocked Rubenstein yet ?
[4:18:18] <Nohorse> If you don't pick up a gun on the floor, the boss is GUARANTEED to drop one. This is known as gun-forcing and good players tend to do it on first floors
[4:18:26] <+bassforte123> LILBOMBER
[4:18:31] <gslayer14> BOMEBER
[4:18:32] <gslayer14> FUCK
[4:18:34] <LegitBarnacleBoy> BOMBER
[4:18:38] <%AzureGale> ALL the keys
[4:18:40] <LegitBarnacleBoy> INFINITE MONEY
[4:18:40] <+bassforte123> PAT
[4:18:44] <%ArchimerCXV> rubenstein's monster only needs both rube-adyne guns to be available
[4:18:45] <gslayer14> BOMBER #1 PRIORITY
[4:18:45] <Nohorse> Bomber is infinite money on Slinger SeemsGood
[4:18:47] <benjiFG> if you get the bomber you can make a shit ton of money with its synergiews
[4:18:48] <LegitBarnacleBoy> PAT
[4:18:51] <LorcaNomad> BUY THE BOMB GUN PAT
[4:18:54] <+bassforte123> Lilbomber give syou unlimited money
[4:18:56] <%holydeviant1> @Nohorse What tier is the boss pool at?
[4:19:17] <$valkuma> yeah any explosive weapon can open secrets so you dont have to waste blanks
[4:19:24] <%ArchimerCXV> oh shit he right, bomb gun will CREATE money with gunslinger
[4:19:24] <softbirby> how did the last run go?
[4:19:24] <LegitBarnacleBoy> BOMB GUN is infinite cash
[4:19:28] <Nohorse> @Nohorse I'm not certain, actually. Think it's random or maybe floor affects it
[4:19:29] <%dork_doggler> @PatStaresAt with all synergies, bomb gun is BUSTED
[4:19:34] <%ArchimerCXV> money on hit
[4:19:36] <Nohorse> You'll see!
[4:19:36] <LorcaNomad> synergy
[4:19:37] <%ArchimerCXV> big hit
[4:19:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> synergy
[4:19:39] <%Agami23> synergy
[4:19:39] <%dork_doggler> synergy!
[4:19:40] <gslayer14> synergies
[4:19:40] <+bassforte123> oh good you can probably afford it, just definately get it
[4:19:49] <Nohorse> It's still a trash gun, but it's HELLA CASH
[4:19:49] <%holydeviant1> I think the bomb gun has a synergy that grants money
[4:19:53] <acsn88> bomber always gets me killed
[4:19:53] <Devbob98> He’ll have enough by end
[4:19:59] <gslayer14> not even bad damage either
[4:20:15] <Lucid_Dynamic> You shouldn't make decisions before you reveal the whole floor.  There might be a shop with strong items.  You can buy keys later.
[4:20:21] <%ArchimerCXV> for a charge weapon bombs can kick ass
[4:20:22] <Nohorse> You know what would give you tons of money? Having 9 curse Kappa
[4:20:53] <DrkJP520> I wonder what the run time is
[4:20:56] <gslayer14> almost wish you had chest friendship now
[4:21:00] <Nohorse> He's doing the roll tech PogChamp Pro gamer
[4:21:24] <%dork_doggler> how muych was the bomb ghunb aghin?
[4:21:29] <Nohorse> Don't underestimate the browns, they tend to refund a key and there are no bad guns on Slinger
[4:21:40] <+bassforte123> I'd actually consider opening a brown chest with this many keys and LilBomber around
[4:22:17] <Nohorse> The game is trying to tell you something? Kappa
[4:22:17] <%ArchimerCXV> nice
[4:22:20] <LorcaNomad> THat's good
[4:22:23] <%AzureGale> GUON STONE WOOOOOOOOO
[4:22:25] <Lucid_Dynamic> Pat, some guns fire faster if you spam the button.
[4:22:27] <Nohorse> If you don't open the brown, the boss WILL drop a gun
[4:22:39] <LegitBarnacleBoy> so close to bomber smiffHowdy smiffHowdy smiffHowdy
[4:22:40] <Nohorse> It won't be useful because you'll never get hit
[4:22:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's not good if you don't take any damage
[4:23:06] <Midnight188> just remember kids: Mentor system bad
[4:23:08] <%AzureGale> Now just hope that +1 bullet shows up at some point
[4:23:13] <%ArchimerCXV> chat how much is the lil bomber in shop? does pat have enough to buy it before he clears the floor of trash mobs?
[4:23:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> Exactly
[4:23:32] <%Chichen> maybe from boss?
[4:23:36] <Nohorse> The boss drops some LUL
[4:23:38] <%ArchimerCXV> ahhh that's pain
[4:23:39] <%AncelDeLambert> kill the boss, maybe mo-ney
[4:23:40] <%AzureGale> It's not like the guon stone doesn't block bullets or anything like that
[4:23:41] <gslayer14> might get cash from brown
[4:23:44] <+ascii3647> brown chest or boss might have money
[4:23:51] <%skeletonman9000> open blue
[4:23:56] <gslayer14> there he is
[4:23:57] <benjiFG> you didn't kill him last time
[4:23:58] <+bassforte123> spared his life
[4:24:03] <Nohorse> What the fuck, why IS there a guy??
[4:24:04] <%dork_doggler> if you don't kill the king's vizier he shows up on floor two
[4:24:06] <%holydeviant1> the advisor shows up at the second boss if you don't kill him
[4:24:10] <%ArchimerCXV> you ddin't kill the attendant last time so now he's here for revenge
[4:24:12] <Nohorse> I never seen that
[4:24:25] <%AncelDeLambert> well if that's how he's gonna act after you spare him, fuggit, kill the Seneschal every time
[4:24:31] <Nohorse> And I thought I 100%'d this game
[4:24:38] <%californaya> GAMER
[4:24:38] <%AzureGale> Phew
[4:24:39] <%holydeviant1> THE BALLS on those plays
[4:24:39] <lloyddboy> THAT LASER WAS SO CLOSE
[4:24:42] <Manwad> if you had Casey, you can knock the advisor into whoever the second boss is to kill them, if I recall.
[4:24:45] <gslayer14> huntsman
[4:24:45] <DrkJP520> You left the little dude alive from the previous chamber. He joined this boss
[4:24:45] <pixelkingu> still godlike

[4:24:56] <Nohorse> Might as well go open those chests LUL
[4:24:57] <%Quigsies> Quigsies subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! Going between the vods for you and woolie's playthroughs of Disco Elysium has been fun now that I've beat it! Art cop for life
[4:24:57] <+ascii3647> you should consider opening any gun chest regardless of color
[4:24:58] <Saltmeisterr> YO
[4:24:59] <%ArchimerCXV> aight ge tlil bomber and make it your primary room clearer
[4:25:02] <%ArchimerCXV> for the MUNS
[4:25:03] <Nohorse> Oh the one with the boots
[4:25:09] <+bassforte123> Doesn't Huntsman let you see secret rooms like the brick?
[4:25:09] <acsn88> blue chest at entrance
[4:25:11] <LorcaNomad> huntsman is just bad
[4:25:13] <Nohorse> Faster fire rate and less spread I think?
[4:25:13] <%holydeviant1> almost ll shotguns have a spread-tightening synergy
[4:25:14] <Saltmeisterr> Look it up pat
[4:25:15] <gslayer14> m o n e y
[4:25:17] <Lucid_Dynamic> Reveals secret rooms

[4:25:42] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt blue bomber gives money on kill
[4:25:42] <Manwad> you'll see some bloodbourne shit on the walls that hide secret rooms
[4:25:43] <%AzureGale> It's over 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[4:25:44] <LorcaNomad> enemy health is shown now
[4:25:52] <%skeletonman9000> nice
[4:25:58] <DrkJP520> It's over 8000
[4:26:07] <%AncelDeLambert> you still have to SHOOT the wall
[4:26:07] <Lucid_Dynamic> It's like brick of cash.
[4:26:07] <%holydeviant1> look for bloodbourne shit on the walls
[4:26:09] <LegitBarnacleBoy> prepare to drown in cash
[4:26:09] <+bassforte123> like the brick, you can't see them on the map

[4:26:21] <Saltmeisterr> look for a bloodborne monster
[4:26:21] <$spardanwarrior> Not on the map, it works like brick of cash
[4:26:29] <$valkuma> explosive weapons open secrets though...
[4:26:34] <TheresAGoff> You can blow down walls with the bomber
[4:26:36] <Lucid_Dynamic> You can open secret rooms with little bomber.
[4:26:41] <+lifeles21> bot bomb opens because it explodes no?
[4:26:42] <DovaDude29> It works like brick of cash
[4:26:45] <JUNNNKEN> little bomber can open secret rooms

[4:48:39] <+lifeles21> shovel night gun lmfao
[4:48:39] <+ascii3647> kek
[4:48:39] <+RushUnplugged> shovelknight item
[4:48:41] <+epoladia> Shovel knight is in every indie game, remember
[4:48:41] <%AncelDeLambert> oooooooo
[4:48:41] <s1rcuit> SHOVEL KNIGHT
[4:48:44] <JUNNNKEN> digs when reload
[4:48:47] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Strike the earth!
[4:48:48] <Louie_Salmon> Exactly what you think it is
[4:48:51] <%weissguard> STEEL THY SHOVEL!
[4:48:53] <+RushUnplugged> Shovel Knight Everywhere System
[4:48:53] <gslayer14> if you reload on empty it digs for items
[4:48:53] <lemon_lover28> man shovel knight is great
[4:48:55] <s1rcuit> wait, what just happened?
[4:48:58] <+Nautilus_Bot> SHOVEL KNIGHT
[4:48:59] <%SWFanatic> friendship
[4:49:00] <%ArchimerCXV> double
[4:49:00] <JUNNNKEN> double
[4:49:03] <Lucid_Dynamic> Double Vision
[4:49:03] <lloyddboy> DUBS
[4:49:05] <LorcaNomad> friendship
[4:49:05] <%Ne1son> Double Vision
[4:49:06] <+bassforte123> on full reload the shovel gun can dig up items
[4:49:06] <%talldarkandintroverted> did i miss near?
[4:49:06] <tattleworm> the ration
[4:49:07] <%dork_doggler> gun friendshiop is usually higher dps
[4:49:08] <Vyskus> gun friendship imo
[4:49:09] <gslayer14> double
[4:49:09] <+SilverStasis> friendship
[4:49:10] <+ascii3647> double
[4:49:11] <$valkuma> do you want double projectiles or fatass shots
[4:49:13] <%Monkeyweed21> DUBS
[4:49:14] <%Dakuu75> idk what either of them do
[4:49:14] <Saltmeisterr> DOUBLE
[4:49:15] <faithless_zealot> My gut's telling mne double vision... but I dunno
[4:49:15] <+RushUnplugged> double is 2x bullets but lower accuracy
[4:49:15] <benjiFG> friendship
[4:49:17] <+KattAndSteven> pat you never want to reload early with the knight's gun. it digs up items when you reload with an empty mag
[4:49:17] <+epoladia> I've completed the game and even I don't know which is better
[4:49:20] <xeros720> gun friendship is a damage and reload boost
[4:49:22] <Gc478xf> Friendship
[4:49:22] <+tetraes> friendship imo
[4:49:34] <linSP> gun friendship is VERY big dps
[4:49:40] <%AzureGale> Put it to a poll
[4:49:42] <%SirGO0SE> whats better with your schuut tho
[4:49:44] <mar_krow> u guys know more about this game than me u guys tell him
[4:49:44] <$valkuma> gun friendship imo
[4:49:52] <LorcaNomad> poll?
[4:49:52] <$valkuma> because if you get the +1 bullets it will synergize better.
[4:49:53] <xeros720> it's a tough choice
[4:49:55] <%talldarkandintroverted> has he already playedd nier?
[4:49:56] <+epoladia> I feel like it depends, but friendship is USUALLY better
[4:49:58] <Lucid_Dynamic> Double Vision doesn't use ammunition twice as fast, unlike Potion of Gun friendship.
[4:49:59] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Gun friendship seems better, esp with synergy
[4:50:00] <+RushUnplugged> honestly depends on the gun
[4:50:02] <mar_krow> poll
[4:50:02] <LegitBarnacleBoy> @patstaresat shovel knight gun will dig shit up if you use the full mag
[4:50:04] <xeros720> double vision might be better with tentacle? does anyone know?
[4:50:06] <%SWFanatic> you'll be fine either way
[4:50:09] <$valkuma> +1 bullets + gun friendship is big boy.
[4:50:14] <cnry_m> Coin flip?
[4:50:18] <%SirGO0SE> yeah i think this comes down to what works with what you have
[4:50:22] <%SWFanatic> i'm not a big fan of the moonshine because aiming is a bit more tricky
[4:50:30] <DrkJP520> Don't reload the shoel manually. Only when your "clip" runs out
[4:50:31] <%Ne1son> never early reload the shovel
[4:50:34] <$valkuma> check out your tentacle gun
[4:50:38] <DrkJP520> Shovel
[4:50:53] <Saltmeisterr> Just 3 more zones
[4:50:55] <+bassforte123> tentacle gun is an amazing room clear
[4:51:03] <+epoladia> Sell the huntsman unless you want to keep the 1 curse
[4:51:18] <%Dakuu75> damn dude, shovel gun looks amaze-balls
[4:51:22] <Devbob98> The health bars really add to the whole game
[4:51:49] <%dork_doggler> just like Shivel Knight the game!
[4:51:55] <%californaya> now if only you could aim...
[4:52:12] <%AzureGale> There are gold casings!?
[4:52:14] <+bassforte123> Shovel: Lol, here's 50 gold
[4:52:18] <%californaya> that shield is dope
[4:52:20] <+bassforte123> YUP
[4:52:38] <%AncelDeLambert> WOAH
[4:52:52] <%AzureGale> "Next time use a key" Yes, use a key to dig up the floor
[4:53:00] <%AncelDeLambert> if we get a late junk knight run I'll shit

[4:54:04] <%Artemis_Scowl> chat is there a "money = power" equivalent in this game?
[4:54:14] <benjiFG> yes
[4:54:16] <s1rcuit> I appreciate that so many games reference Shovel Knight
[4:54:17] <gslayer14> @Artemis_Scowl yes

[5:17:50] <@SSaryn> Ok so, question as a person who don't know Gungeon, any reason to actually just pick up every single gun other than just big more ammo? Do they got stats tied to them too?

[5:29:35] <gslayer14> it's hell
[5:29:36] <+bassforte123> Yes
[5:29:39] <T_Sasquatch> did pat start with gungeon ?
[5:29:40] <gslayer14> ...in the past
[5:29:45] <@SSaryn> Interesting, ok.
[5:29:50] <gslayer14> yeah
[5:29:51] <T_Sasquatch> thanks
[5:29:53] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat started with FF14
[5:29:56] <+bassforte123> The game's question is "Why is this this character's past?"
[5:30:05] <linSP> something went down in bullet hell past mayhaps
[5:30:07] <%X2Eliah> @T_Sasquatch Naw, he did the ff14 thing
[5:30:08] <+ostrichsenpai> gungeon is not so hot on the lore side of things
[5:30:13] <%AncelDeLambert> ZOOOOOOOOM
[5:30:22] <%AncelDeLambert> GAS GAS GAS, gotta step on the gas!
[5:30:29] <gslayer14> strafe is for bosses
[5:30:36] <%AncelDeLambert> holy shit the douser is shooting ultracooled gasoline
[5:30:48] <Fluffy_Tamamo> Its a water gun why is fire spreading on water? snuffWhat
[5:30:49] <%Xelhesia> Xelhesia subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[5:30:53] <+epoladia> Again, only worse framerate is cactus I think
[5:31:08] <xxshadowxx416> racoon girl
[5:31:14] <%X2Eliah> oh it's shooting gasoline?
[5:31:16] <%X2Eliah> ohh
[5:31:21] <%X2Eliah> Wait that's not eco
[5:31:24] <%the22cstomp> pc humbled by a 2014 indie game
[5:31:26] <linSP> water beat 3080 every time
[5:31:29] <$RealThiele> DAMN, E STREAMIN
[5:31:30] <DrkJP520> Strafegun shoots little needles that will explode when you stop firing
[5:31:30] <+bassforte123> The supersoker's synergy makes water/ice flammable, it's GARBAGE if you can't fly
[5:31:38] <+ChampionBob> Unity games often do that...
[5:31:40] <%the22cstomp> sorry 2016
[5:31:47] <$RealThiele> ts pretty late tho
[5:31:49] <%dork_doggler> @Fluffy_Tamamo douser syunergy with napalm makes it flammable
[5:31:50] <%X2Eliah> Let's be real the gamei s only choppy because Pat is mining dogecoin in the background
[5:32:48] <Saltmeisterr> nah its bad on consoles too
[5:32:51] <+epoladia> Even then, the douser synergy is a LOT
[5:32:55] <korpocalypse> thanks for that btw
[5:32:57] <+RushUnplugged> the game is basically all CPU and streaming hurts
[5:33:03] <@SSaryn> I assume it's engine limitations too honestly.
[5:33:26] <+RushUnplugged> I wouldn't be surprised if it just ran on 1 core
[5:33:26] <Nohorse> The game is actually not coded super optimally, the devs have expressed that they're unhappy about that a few times
[5:33:27] <LorcaNomad> I'm glad I don't have much to do tomorrow because goddammit I want to see this
[5:33:29] <+bassforte123> @epoladia "Look at what you've done, Chowder!" Now the animators are gonna have to draw all this fire!"
[5:33:29] <Saltmeisterr> bottom left
[5:33:53] <+epoladia> @bassforte123 Trueeeee
[5:34:17] <$RealThiele> game went and got more popular than the dev anticipated
[5:34:33] <DegenCat> HERE WE GO
[5:34:34] <linSP> yoooo
[5:34:35] <+bassforte123> Wooo
[5:34:35] <%Dr_DangerPhD> can the shovel dig up ammo boxes? at boss door he might be able to dig and get lucky
[5:34:36] <Saltmeisterr> GL PAT

[5:37:02] <+GeneralGray8> The rat and the advanced dragun are both fucked up fights

[5:37:23] <gslayer14> @PatStaresAt Rat.
[5:37:24] <benjiFG> @PatStaresAt remember to talk to the challenge guy
[5:37:26] <+ostrichsenpai> Rat boss
[5:37:26] <%valriot> Kill the Rat
[5:37:26] <+weaster4> rat key
[5:37:27] <%dork_doggler> @PatStaresAt beat the rat, get a key, free a snake, get the snake to dragfun
[5:37:27] <+epoladia> Either rat hideout or the weird egg
[5:37:28] <Saltmeisterr> U need to get the egg
[5:37:28] <+ascii3647> gotta beat the rat
[5:37:31] <+sparkjavelin> hatch the egg
[5:37:32] <LorcaNomad> advanced dragun is just not fun to fight it's bullshit
[5:37:33] <%Monkeyweed21> need to beat the rat
[5:37:37] <+bassforte123> You get 2 keys from the rat, then you get an egg.  Drop the egg in fire, feed the baby 10 items I think, then take the baby to the dragon boss
[5:37:37] <$spardanwarrior> Hidden thing after the rat fight
[5:37:39] <$RealThiele> punch out!
[5:37:40] <linSP> theres an egg that the rat keeps you hatch it and bring it to the dragon
[5:37:41] <+GeneralGray8> Gotta beat the rat and do some other BS afterwards
[5:37:41] <Saltmeisterr> oh get the egg
[5:37:43] <%dork_doggler> No, too OP for costume
