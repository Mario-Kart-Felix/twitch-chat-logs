[0:12:03] <Louie_Salmon> That's not true, Northernlion is quite tall
[0:12:09] <BallinArbiter> Where’s the Paige?
[0:12:09] <beetbo2> Egg boi
[0:12:09] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Wasteland 2 was pretty good though.
[0:12:16] <%augusm> That new Obsidianngame looks awful, the studio doesn't even have the same writers it had back when New Vegas was mades
[0:12:25] <Dio_TR> Pat is gonna bounce the fuck out this game and I'm gonna enjoy his suffering
[0:12:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pride500 Indeed, one is not able to talk to Twitter like one can talk to Pat. And if you could, would you even want to? A personification of Twitter would likely be a sanity-annihilating Elder God.
[0:12:48] <ape_hawk> joshua sawyer >>> chris avellone
[0:12:48] <StripesUltimateEdition> where we're going we don't need avallone
[0:12:50] <Katorskay> speaking of new vegas
[0:12:51] <%ShadowFolk> ShadowFolk subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Yo, Pat, you still got your mini Pat plushie?

[0:12:56] <TwinBat> new vegas only had 2 writers?

[0:12:59] <ActualNobody6400> @AngriestPat what's the volume of that bottle?
[0:12:59] <Hawkbone_> $20 says the game launches in an unplayable, buggy mess
[0:13:01] <Calern> are you going in blind?
[0:13:01] <ittla> obsidian still makes the only good crpgs so........
[0:13:02] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Chris Avellone is busy working on the EA Star Wars game
[0:13:02] <beetbo2> Isn’t avellone one dying light
[0:13:04] <DatAsuna> That's not half
[0:13:07] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I like Chris, but I don't think he's the world's greatest writer. Good certainly, but it doesn't need him.
[0:13:09] <DatAsuna> Pat is just silly
[0:13:14] <beetbo2> The squeakquel
[0:13:16] <Katorskay> whens the new vegas dlc pat

[0:13:27] <%GohanEgret> just remember that Splatoon was made by a crew of fairly young Nintendo employees, so it's not a guarantee that returning folks are the only ones to make good stuff

[0:14:14] <Skatedeandre> How much is an ounce even
[0:14:15] <%Gray_skies1993> that probably tastes awful
[0:14:16] <Sikelh> RC/Diet Rite are superior
[0:14:16] <%depressed_skeleton> Add Alcohol to your redbull
[0:14:18] <Prism_Wing> Yea cocaine and redbull don't mix
[0:14:21] <+Spec7re> Oh so you want to add Coke to the redbull got it

[0:15:58] <Funkyfjord> but ff8 most stupid
[0:15:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> @louie_salmon He should chop off his whole body to get rid of all the liquid. Then he can be a nice dry incorporeal presence.
[0:15:59] <%Yadogari> FF9 is great
[0:16:01] <Kazuhira_Boat> FF6 = Best
[0:16:01] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @alphonseisbest I know, but I did answer what you asked, then tacked on more.
[0:16:02] <%MorelK> ff8 is the best thats correct
[0:16:03] <$lacroximus> FF 9 is the best.

[0:24:15] <+Deano8817> @jellssssss20 probably because crows can also recognize specific faces
[0:24:16] <gigacanuck> 300 IQ crows
[0:24:17] <%cvp5127> thats rad
[0:24:17] <%demegodz> "Yeah it's those fuckers again"

[0:24:25] <Clu_Flynn> Crows IQ is over 400 on average
[0:24:25] <%crimsonharvest> crows can identify a person by their gait alone
[0:24:25] <rearedlogarithm> Birds are weird.

[0:24:35] <TwinBat> too bad birds aren't real
[0:24:35] <Moisthoodie> could a crow solve a shadow puzzle
[0:24:36] <%ShichiNoBushi> They use traffic to crush nuts.

[0:24:44] <DatAsuna> @AngriestPat Have you seen the bird that can sew?

[0:24:44] <Endocrom> Object permenance I think
[0:24:46] <+CanonHusbando> you can't fuck a crow so what does it matter?
[0:24:47] <marvel877> they also like to smash
[0:24:47] <benjiFG> but do crows understand why kids love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
[0:24:49] <%MagickBurritoh> Birds aren't real
[0:24:49] <rufus2k2> crows know how to SNOWBOARD

[0:24:58] <Clu_Flynn> Crows have cities
[0:25:02] <%goose_attack_almanac> And now birds of prey in australia are using fires to hunt prey
[0:25:04] <%QueequegTheater> They're basically as smart as 8-10 year olds

[0:43:07] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Landfill organize their garbage so it bio degrades faster.
[0:43:08] <T_Sasquatch> Honestly the only reason it's a big news story worldwide is because it has to do with an anime studio.

[0:43:23] <+Estuko> I spent 2-3 hours helping a friend fix her resume and update it to look nice out of my day, only to find out she never went to any interview for jobs I helped her with and is just selling some glitter bottles she made for "Stress relief" NotLikeThis
[0:43:24] <%QueequegTheater> no like all the things i like

[1:02:19] <InugamiTheHound> why do Aliens eat marshmallows?
[1:02:20] <Desertfishing> hop

[1:02:28] <DrFaustMD> I don't understand why is he playing a game
[1:02:34] <starotter70> @wolfofsound Yeah, I don't know, maybe it was cause they were on fire or something
[1:02:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> Right out of the gate this game has a mood that I am digging
[1:02:43] <%Promessa_EX> the weebs teach the aliens about marshmellows
[1:02:43] <dekkitout> Man, this track is doing things to my soul
[1:02:43] <Flickerember> Is this the Obsidian game or am I mixing names up unless I got punk'd by Pat
[1:02:44] <+Spec7re> Ooof
[1:02:46] <%Faustgesicht> marshmellow flavored logs are where it's at
[1:02:48] <Ner234> WOw
[1:02:49] <%docpepperphd> super fair
[1:02:51] <+jpivot> the obsidian game is Outer Worlds
[1:02:55] <Rosy_Joan> chat you're gonna love it when Pat gets to the eldritch space horror stuff
[1:02:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @starotter70 for good reason. put it in the fire too long and you got a hot molten mess that falls off the stick. it's a hazard
[1:03:00] <Reanimator83> Why does this remind me of Firefly
[1:03:09] <Flickerember> Ah I saw outer and was like oh snap
[1:03:11] <MrGremy> shoot him no one will know
[1:03:14] <DrFaustMD> cowboysbin space

[1:20:41] <dekkitout> Dread of the existential variety?
[1:20:41] <+Reveresao> you havent seen the dread yet
[1:20:42] <ThespianBarrage> Don't float off into oblivion forever
[1:20:43] <+jcenderion> Don't worry there will be a lot of that
[1:20:43] <+MidnightBurst12> fun
[1:20:44] <%docpepperphd> vertigo
[1:20:45] <Ner234> This is very monkaS
[1:20:47] <Treuan> Space is great at that
[1:20:49] <+jpivot> dread >:)
[1:20:50] <+ArcLifth> You also have a fuel limit
[1:20:53] <+SoarFlyer> quick pat MANAGE YOUR INVENTORY
[1:20:56] <faegbeard> don't get stuck in a one way tunnel because of your ribs pat
[1:20:56] <Peacefrog7> this is gonna be a great lp
[1:20:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "And then, he stopped thinking."
[1:20:56] <+CanonHusbando> this is a horror game probably
[1:20:56] <+maffblunge> wouldn't be as bad if it wasn't so dark monkaS
[1:21:02] <Dio_TR> @elenamanetta you literally lose control of yourself
[1:21:03] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Touch it. Looks safe.
[1:21:03] <JayEarly> what is this place?
[1:21:05] <%UsMitsu17> This game seems cool
[1:21:11] <Peacefrog7> @canonhusbando more than you know
[1:21:12] <ThespianBarrage> Fuel's looking pretty low there bud.
[1:21:13] <%ElenaManetta> Not in a VIDEO GAMMME!
[1:21:14] <%crimsonharvest> relative velocity is the only important thing in EVA maneuvers and rendezvous
[1:21:18] <Dementedpenguin> Solar Jetman here we go.
[1:21:21] <$Order_of_Mystery> it takes getting used to, but it'll grow on ya Pat
[1:21:25] <+jpivot> spoilers: if you run out of fuel it just uses oxygen and theres plenty of air on this planet
[1:21:26] <Dio_TR> @elenamanetta IMMERSION
[1:21:29] <+CanonHusbando> @Peacefrog7 that was not a prediction i wanted to be true
[1:21:30] <salmarillion> Flying in zero G is a real brain scrambler for the 1st time
[1:21:36] <$Order_of_Mystery> and yeah, match velocity is great!
[1:21:40] <+Mr_Pylon> match velocity is your best friend
[1:21:50] <dekkitout> We're all just spinning, really
[1:21:51] <+jpivot> match velocity is a great airbrake
[1:21:52] <%ElenaManetta> Gravity wasn't invented until 1804
[1:21:59] <Peacefrog7> @canonhusbando not horror that you expect more like.... anxiety inducing
[1:22:04] <Dio_TR> this game is high budget Jank but it's Good
[1:22:05] <%wolfofsound> monkaS
[1:22:06] <faegbeard> how did people get by before the invention of gravity
[1:22:08] <%crimsonharvest> Now you see why stationkeeping on satellites is important, without it they'd drift all to fuck
[1:22:08] <$Order_of_Mystery> I love the mechanics in this game, in that every one of them have distinct uses
[1:22:12] <+maffblunge> @dekkitout that's fuckin deep, brother
[1:22:13] <$Order_of_Mystery> flashlight!
[1:22:15] <Endocrom> Have fun, Pat
[1:22:15] <+Reveresao> 1
[1:22:17] <HeadsHeldHigh> PANIC
[1:22:18] <%crimsonharvest> turn your flashlight on
[1:22:19] <+jpivot> TRAPPED
[1:22:19] <+CanonHusbando> @Peacefrog7 space is just night
[1:22:22] <+SoarFlyer> @faegbeard downforce
[1:22:22] <+jcenderion> There is a flashlight button
[1:22:24] <%CJett92> It's aboveneath you
[1:22:26] <+Estuko> Not being able to see things in the deep dark sea is a high level fear fofr me
[1:22:26] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> THE LID
[1:22:27] <+JackMillerTime> before gravity they had to fight mass
[1:22:28] <+MidnightBurst12> uh oh
[1:22:33] <Hawkbone_> This game is really chill but is amazing at instilling dread and panic
[1:22:36] <beetbo2> Darkness imprison
[1:22:37] <%PlainSimpleTailor> in zero G, doesn't your mind quasi-cease to function if you don't have some point of reference to orient yourself with?
[1:22:37] <JayEarly> why is there no gravity underground?
[1:22:38] <+Mr_Pylon> welcome to fake space
[1:22:41] <+SoarFlyer> head cronch

[1:23:14] <Dio_TR> Pat will fucking suffocate in this stream I'm sure of it
[1:23:21] <%CJett92> ??
[1:23:22] <+jpivot> he already did dio
[1:23:23] <+TheBitingIrish> Oh, no doubt
[1:23:25] <%crimsonharvest> gravity is low inside the planet because it pulls on you from all directions
[1:23:26] <+jpivot> he went into the water
[1:23:30] <$Order_of_Mystery> weird, but you'll get used to it. it's okay!
[1:23:33] <Peacefrog7> @dio_tr yes he will
[1:23:33] <+Spec7re> a place for everything and a thing for every place
[1:23:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> mmm, delicious cola
[1:23:54] <MassConnect> you can't spell suffocate without cat
[1:23:56] <HeadsHeldHigh> What was the flat-earther's gravity theory? Down force?
[1:23:57] <%ElenaManetta> SPACE TRAiNING: COMPLETE
[1:23:59] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Always remember: if you want to land on the surface of the Sun, do it at nighttime crikIQ
[1:23:59] <+Micalica> If a planet that small decreases in gravity that much if you only go down a few feet, how fucking dense must the matter be?!
[1:24:01] <%MelBrooksKA> Pat, remember the basics of CQC!
[1:24:08] <%crimsonharvest> the observatory!

[1:24:26] <$Order_of_Mystery> @AngriestPat it only gets better from here. woolieGASM

[1:32:34] <%SirGO0SE> they just proved took pictures of that phenom in action like last week btw
[1:32:34] <Peacefrog7> oh nononono
[1:32:36] <Us3rr> how'd they get it there?
[1:32:39] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Quantum Solar System
[1:32:45] <%wolfofsound> hmm
[1:32:46] <CatmanIX> nowai
[1:32:48] <%ElenaManetta> So when people say you can perma die in this game, does that include a certain type of save scumming where you quickly exit the game if you die before the game auto-saves so you can live
[1:32:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> That thing could probably quantum tunnel into your torso
[1:32:51] <%ElenaManetta> asking for a friend
[1:32:52] <%ShichiNoBushi> That's because space is expanding.
[1:32:53] <Funkyfjord> man this is going to have quantum puzzles isn't it
[1:32:57] <Funkyfjord> paige should play it
[1:33:13] <+SoarFlyer> space expanding is some bullshit why's it gotta be like that
[1:33:15] <EuropantLamprey> I still want Paige to play KSP
[1:33:26] <MrGremy> pat has schrodinger's buttplug
[1:33:27] <$Order_of_Mystery> @Funkyfjord the puzzels in this game are great!
[1:33:29] <salmarillion> All space is expanding, except my hard drive space
[1:33:33] <aimlesshealer> Pffff fuck safety
[1:33:35] <Funkyfjord> excellent
[1:33:41] <Dio_TR> @elenamanetta you can only die if you kill yourself without going through a sequence in the tutorial after that it becomes a death loop
[1:33:43] <dekkitout> That Nomai came from the Moon.
[1:33:53] <+ScrapSentinel> LUL
[1:33:54] <gigacanuck> persuaded

[1:36:57] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> That's... surprisingly accurate I think
[1:36:59] <ZazzyDoesStuff> I can't wait till you die and you get special dialouge of your character remembering that they died and came back.

[1:45:16] <EuropantLamprey> He almost got run over by the moon
[1:45:16] <+CanonHusbando> pat gravity will always pull you towards the nearest object breaking gravity is a lie just ask einstein
[1:45:16] <Jack_of_No_Trades> just abandon ship
[1:45:16] <%snow_bush> Baba is Gravity
[1:45:18] <+Reveresao> F
[1:45:18] <+daleandhisbeard> here we go
[1:45:20] <EASrake> monkaS
[1:45:20] <mield916> no suit, just space
[1:45:22] <%SWFanatic> F
[1:45:26] <%Rafferty3231> I love this art style so much
[1:45:27] <splicerss> Damn warframe looks wierd
[1:45:31] <Us3rr> death incoming
[1:45:31] <dekkitout> I mean orbiting is just falling, but perpendicular
[1:45:35] <HeadsHeldHigh> chill chat it takes a bit to get used to
[1:45:40] <+TheBitingIrish> Gotta put on his safety suit
[1:45:41] <KaliasTV> Time for moon impact hell yeah
[1:45:42] <Louie_Salmon> You're falling.
[1:45:43] <ConLin_Arts_> dont ram the sun again
[1:45:44] <%Psyramics> gravity!
[1:45:45] <%MelBrooksKA> That's gravity
[1:45:45] <transporterthesequel> No that's speed pat
[1:45:45] <+SoarFlyer> pat
[1:45:46] <%CJett92> because gravity
[1:45:47] <%decisivelynameless> You have to hold it to keep the velocity
[1:45:48] <+jpivot> sun's got gravity my man
[1:45:48] <+Despera__> GRAVIITY
[1:45:48] <+Yokuho> @AngriestPat What is gravity?
[1:45:48] <+WyvernsArentDragons> Gravity Pat
[1:45:48] <SoySocks> no, you're moving at the speed of the sun
[1:45:49] <Bearborg> gravity
[1:45:49] <KruelDestiny> Pats brain is broken
[1:45:51] <%ThatRandomGuy661> gravity
[1:45:51] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat keep moving and you won't have to worry about floating into the sun
[1:45:51] <+jcenderion> That is how gravity works Pat
[1:45:53] <Louie_Salmon> Nothing floats in space
[1:45:53] <%Psyramics> gravity is always in play!
[1:45:55] <%SWFanatic> You IS Gravity
[1:45:56] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat velocity is not acceleration, Pat
[1:45:58] <+SourDoughRye> pat do the thing but good!
[1:45:59] <+Shady_Zaku> Br A In
[1:45:59] <salmarillion> You match velocity at that time, gravity will pull you after
[1:45:59] <Jack_of_No_Trades> gravity is the attractive force attributed to mass
[1:46:00] <+Reveresao> @AngriestPat YOU CAN'T ORBIT
[1:46:01] <%wujak> once you match velocity your thrusts turn off, then gravity is pulling you again
[1:46:01] <Louie_Salmon> Nothing has ever floated in space
[1:46:03] <+TheHeroJackMan> Aim not at it?
[1:46:03] <+SoarFlyer> baba is gravitated
[1:46:04] <%shadyesq> Youre matching its rotational veocity so you land in one spot.
[1:46:05] <Bearborg> there is no orbit
[1:46:07] <mield916> manually
[1:46:08] <TigerClaws12> move sideways faster
[1:46:08] <EuropantLamprey> But Gravity ceases to be!
[1:46:08] <%decisivelynameless> Hold A to keep the velocity steady. There is no "orbit".
[1:46:09] <$Order_of_Mystery> match velocity is orbit
[1:46:10] <HeadsHeldHigh> chat lied
[1:46:10] <dekkitout> By going really fast
[1:46:11] <Garry_Guyface> @AngriestPat That's because the sun has big gravity, that's why planets stay with it without moving
[1:46:14] <$Order_of_Mystery> ^^^
[1:46:15] <therealtacopancakes> But the sun has gravity
[1:46:15] <%connos_procrastination> See the problem with this game is theres no hot aliens
[1:46:15] <+Mr_Pylon> because of constant acceleration
[1:46:15] <%TaifuDragon> orbit doesn't matter, just go land on something else
[1:46:16] <%puhff> It is weird that autopilot doesn't compensate for that
[1:46:18] <Hawkbone_> You can totally orbit
[1:46:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> no orbit you must fly
[1:46:20] <Peacefrog7> you are always falling towards the sun
[1:46:23] <+Shaggnar> You need orbital velocity
[1:46:23] <+CanonHusbando> ship isn't built for orbit, it's made of wood
[1:46:25] <+Sestren413> Chat is liar you can orbit but you have to do it manually. Why would you want to?
[1:46:26] <Hawkbone_> You have to establish an orbit manually
[1:46:27] <Us3rr> RIP
[1:46:27] <+Fenlig> You can match the velocity of a planet orbiting it!
[1:46:27] <%decisivelynameless> @AngriestPat It says Hold to match gravity. Don't stop holding.
[1:46:30] <+jorgamund> don't listen to the haters, you orbit if you feel like it
[1:46:32] <salmarillion> Orbiting is going sideways fast!
[1:46:32] <$Order_of_Mystery> or wait, i'm wrong
[1:46:39] <+SkitsofRandom> your mass is too small to keep you in orbit for a reasonable amount of time without being pulled in
[1:46:40] <VigilantShield> key word "probably"
[1:46:40] <%Promessa_EX> that looks like orbit
[1:46:41] <+SoarFlyer> smashing into planet in 10...
[1:46:42] <Jack_of_No_Trades> alright go space diving
[1:46:43] <+Mr_Pylon> landing is where it's at
[1:46:52] <Goldenwolf98> Pat said its fine prepare for a death
[1:46:52] <+ScrapSentinel> pat you're still moving
[1:46:55] <$Order_of_Mystery> you have a map. back i think?
[1:46:58] <$cureneckbeard> This is like that DS9 episode where Sisko builds a Bajoran sailing ship out of wood

[1:47:27] <+SourDoughRye> THE TETHER
[1:47:27] <CptBritches> What were you planning on doing there?
[1:47:27] <+Shaggnar> Orbiting is falling in a circle because you're falling at an angle relieve to the orbiting body. So you need to travel at speed perpendicular to what you want to orbit

[1:49:33] <Garry_Guyface> It'd get annoying for the player if he did
[1:49:34] <+SourDoughRye> your possesing yourself in another dimension?

[1:50:00] <Endocrom> Remember the time loop episode of TNG, things change slightly.
[1:50:00] <$Order_of_Mystery> also, there is no downside to having the suit on at all times, Pat

[1:50:42] <+SoarFlyer> @jpivot $100%
[1:50:44] <+Reveresao> nothing in the loop changes, you only gain knowledge to do/find things

[2:10:16] <%ShichiNoBushi> If it was, the moon would be a giant grassy field with a single tree and 5 masked kids running around.
[2:10:18] <Calern> i think theres something near one of those
[2:10:18] <+Irkallu> Wait, the sun is about to explode?
[2:10:21] <Endocrom> And now the second part of the game where the time limit starts.
[2:10:25] <%Psyramics> Fun tip chat, when a star is about to die, it expands massively in size! Our sun when it goes will consume the Earth! Also, it turns red
[2:10:27] <Hawkbone_> That fuckin mysterious ass comet...

[2:11:30] <Noshi1234> quick, commit suicide before you die!
[2:11:30] <$Order_of_Mystery> @AngriestPat the ship log will let you know when you've explored everything. sometimes, you will have to explore other places in order to 'complete' a planet or thing
[2:11:33] <thegreenbenis> @beetbo2 Don't worry bout it.

[2:22:06] <%CJett92> CJett92 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! The best way I've heard this game described is that feeling you get from "The Witness" but its every 5 minutes

[2:22:55] <shotgunspaghetti> @hawk_rush no no no
[2:23:00] <%valkuma> @hawk_rush thats called Outer Worlds. very close name
[2:23:01] <Endocrom> Remember the planet Nibbler was on...
[2:23:06] <+Tobatcie> This game is so fucking good
[2:23:10] <Tennochief> oh no

[2:23:52] <%SWFanatic> this is like Myst in space
[2:23:53] <CatmanIX> pun probably lost in translation
[2:23:54] <%foreverN2dust> @valkuma they share nothing besides space travel from what I can tell
[2:23:57] <beetbo2> Ember twin?
[2:24:06] <Rionxgarland> how many planets has he been to?
[2:24:08] <dekkitout> You know what that sounds like to me, small scale dyson sphereeee~
[2:24:15] <%daws_combine> daws_combine subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:24:21] <%crimsonharvest> jsut a guess as i havent played it, bu the ash twin looks like it might be some kind of tidal power plant on a planetary scale
[2:24:22] <+JavaManJoJo> Does that pun imply English? Or at least that the translator is so good that it can still carry over puns... or ya know just a slight oversight.
[2:24:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> So that's why these guys have like no metal
[2:24:26] <%hawk_rush> oh damn, this game got some great reviews
[2:24:26] <natebud> Is that an Outer Wild?

[2:29:54] <+VersusOmnibus> Did he get this game from EGS or is he on Xbox?
[2:29:56] <%mastertwin2> It's the goddamn sphere grid
[2:29:56] <beetbo2> Is that a clock?
[2:30:00] <Tennochief> language?
[2:30:02] <Funkyfjord> it might be a clock
[2:30:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> counting down till doomsday
[2:30:03] <%DraxTD> see the patterns within patterns @AngriestPat
[2:30:04] <%castarts> oh god it is the sphere grid

[2:30:12] <$Kenzo2000> Nah bro, beehive
[2:30:13] <beetbo2> A literal death clock??
[2:30:15] <Bearborg> @VersusOmnibus EGS, he has KB controls
[2:30:16] <%Gray_skies1993> that's gotta be something for the quantum moon, or its a doomsday clock
[2:30:21] <combomaniadeluxe> is this the beyblade moses used to part the red sea with
[2:30:23] <thegreenbenis> BOOST
[2:30:25] <ape_hawk> so is this Myst but in space?
[2:30:26] <shinbuya> until the BIG BOOM
[2:30:26] <thegreenbenis> USE BOOST

[2:30:35] <Tennochief> Infinite Crisis
[2:30:36] <thegreenbenis> YOU CAN BOOST
[2:30:41] <Garry_Guyface> Myst but with gameplay in space
[2:30:49] <natebud> It's just another thing you need a key for probably
[2:31:05] <Funkyfjord> ya i was thinking it could be a lock of some sort too
[2:31:07] <%wolfofsound> crickets in space
[2:31:13] <+ZoltanBMagnus> this game is the real infinite undiscovery
[2:31:19] <Tennochief> LUL

[2:49:58] <BallinArbiter> Ship gotta get the ship
[2:49:59] <natebud> We need a 22 minute countdown on the screen
[2:50:02] <Hawkbone_> You can probably just jetpack straight to the planet
[2:50:02] <Garry_Guyface> the *other* floor
[2:50:03] <+WyvernsArentDragons> low fuel monkaS
[2:50:03] <Crit_Chance> you missed the alpha copy of the Outer Worlds on the table back there
[2:50:06] <%wolfofsound> he thinks the ship is still there LUL
[2:50:18] <%hawk_rush> I look away for 5 minutes, and he's in sometime crazy ruins ass place
[2:50:19] <ZazzyDoesStuff> There were other parts orbiting with the one you're currently in. Might be some of the missing parts.
[2:50:23] <Treuan> Gotta get to sleep, but I'm stoked that you're playing this! My favorite game from he past couple months
[2:50:26] <$GoogleyGareth> ooo
[2:50:27] <combomaniadeluxe> pat the ship is 2 kilometers away
[2:50:30] <$KnivesEve> im so confused on whats happening other then the dying/repeat thing
[2:50:35] <%crimsonharvest> a model? or status screen?
[2:50:38] <caol2017> This is some Witness shit
[2:50:39] <@lewdskeletor13> @hawk_rush Yeah it’s a bit disorienting
[2:50:44] <$GoogleyGareth> oo
[2:50:44] <Virokwet> this game is a mindfuck
[2:51:01] <dekkitout> So it's a black box?
[2:51:04] <Louie_Salmon> This is so similar to the witness, now that you mention it
[2:51:07] <LodiFrostbeard> RANDOM
[2:51:07] <aimlesshealer> Minigolf interface, the natural enemy of Paige
[2:51:10] <nexuion> loop is 22 minutes
[2:51:17] <%crimsonharvest> no this is just a log
[2:51:24] <%JJCheeker> JJCheeker gifted a Tier 1 sub to GoogleyGareth! They have given 8 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[2:51:27] <%hawk_rush> @lewdskeletor13 yeah I have to full on pay attention to follow what's happening
[2:51:29] <Funkyfjord> if it changes ever time this place has to know about the supernova and the loop
[2:51:31] <+jcenderion> Pat play that again
[2:51:36] <thetechnicalraven> @aimlesshealer Any sort of puzzle is anathema to Paige Kappa
[2:51:39] <%GoogleyGareth> @JJCheeker Thanks for the sub!

[2:51:59] <+Estuko> BABA is inevitable heat death of the universe?
[2:51:59] <%JJCheeker> apatGoblin
[2:52:00] <Funkyfjord> lol thats cool, the canon annihilates itself whenever it does it's job and then just keeps doing it again
[2:52:09] <%crimsonharvest> its probably nearby, just as debris
[2:52:20] <%Psyramics> @Funkyfjord Or quantum effects cause difefrences in the output of their RNG
[2:52:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat...try firing a probe while you are in the probe thingy
[2:52:21] <hntronium> Your ship isn't there anymore
[2:52:22] <CatmanIX> >ship: 2.3km
[2:52:23] <+WyvernsArentDragons> lol, Pat's ship landed on another planet before Pat did
[2:52:32] <hntronium> 2 kilometers away and rising
[2:52:33] <thatthiefoverthere> @Funkyfjord cool ass scifi shit
[2:52:39] <natebud> Let's take bets on how far the away the ship will be when pat notices.
[2:52:39] <%Gray_skies1993> Man I'm loving the mystery/discovery vibes in this game
[2:52:48] <LodiFrostbeard> the ship is so fucking gone it's not funny
[2:52:48] <Funkyfjord> there was another piece or two of this place floating around ya?
[2:52:49] <%wolfofsound> the ship is in an alternative reality at this point
[2:52:52] <Ner234> Pat, ship is like 2000 m away. you might as well just in this spot and reset.
[2:52:53] <Hawkbone_> He's gonna have to splash down in the ocean
[2:52:55] <SpaceGuntank> ship's gone yo
[2:52:56] <Garry_Guyface> Well the ship keeps drifting and it keeps on drifting and it keeps on drifting and it keeps on drifting
[2:53:02] <%crimsonharvest> it said the window was open
[2:53:04] <Endocrom> So the probe is in the same time loop till it randomly does it's job correctly?
[2:53:10] <$Order_of_Mystery> i'm so happy pat likes this game, it really is an awesome expierence
[2:53:10] <%Reveresao> go to ship
[2:53:12] <+geo1020> @wolfofsound like the music genre

[2:58:53] <%Gray_skies1993> now things are getting pieced together
[2:58:56] <%Broand> I want this game but it's on epic store :<
[2:58:59] <ZazzyDoesStuff> This game is so dope
[2:59:00] <CatmanIX> why tf is it epic exclusive
[2:59:03] <thegreenbenis> WASH YOUR HANDS
[2:59:05] <Moonlight_Grimoire> it's blue shifting, wait doesn't that mean it should be coming at him due to shorter WAVELENGTHS? should be red shifted due to going away
[2:59:06] <rearedlogarithm> You might want to go ahead and activate the time freeze while reading shit, then. Because you're probably going to crash into something.
[2:59:07] <hntronium> The sickest speed run strats
[2:59:10] <krymzen5> its on xbone too
[2:59:12] <%wolfofsound> I bought it anyways
[2:59:16] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I forgot Pat's setting, does time freezes for ship log viewing?
[2:59:21] <$eldritchbee> You CAN catch it, its just really hard and does nothing
[2:59:22] <%Broand> Because it was underdevelopment for ages and was hype for years
[2:59:23] <aimlesshealer> Not getting this on the Epic store, fuck that
[2:59:25] <%wolfofsound> hades already tempted me into getting it
[2:59:29] <%Gray_skies1993> no only for translations @Reizie_Etherealm
[2:59:30] <CatmanIX> @Reizie_Etherealm not currently
[2:59:34] <hntronium> I'll buy this when its no longer on epic
[2:59:35] <%DonatelloJose> Wait it’s only on epic, never mine
[2:59:40] <hntronium> whenever that is
[2:59:44] <%Reveresao> @reizie_etherealm it can, but Pat didn't pick it
[2:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:53] <$Order_of_Mystery> @Reizie_Etherealm yeah, time freezes when you read stuff: the ship log, and Nomai writing
[2:59:54] <aimlesshealer> I'll just watch the adventures of Space Captain Pat, master pilot and explorer
[3:00:12] <+Trixie_Princess> this song fire
[3:00:14] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Pat's current loop is gonna be spent reading the ship log isn't it
[3:00:16] <$Order_of_Mystery> oh hey chat, did Pat find the eject button yet??
[3:00:25] <hntronium> not yet
[3:00:26] <CatmanIX> @Order_of_Mystery no, you've got to set it to do that, only frozen on translations right now
[3:00:34] <%Reveresao> @reizie_etherealm he only picked translator I think
[3:00:38] <nexuion> Should we tell him about the multiple endings
[3:00:46] <$Order_of_Mystery> @CatmanIX oh really? dang, that's something he should probably do
[3:00:46] <CatmanIX> no
[3:00:50] <%DonatelloJose> No
[3:00:52] <Noshi1234> no
[3:00:58] <dekkitout> Please
[3:00:59] <hntronium> Let him fuck up as he pleases
[3:01:00] <%Gray_skies1993> no don't tell him
[3:01:01] <+lucaflow> god no
[3:01:05] <thetechnicalraven> We must ensure Pat gets the worst ending Kappa
[3:01:07] <aimlesshealer> Chat shut your mouth, don't tell him anything
[3:01:07] <CatmanIX> @Order_of_Mystery he chose not to /shrug
[3:01:17] <$Order_of_Mystery> when/if he beats it, maybe. for now no, no ending spoilies
[3:01:22] <$cureneckbeard> no spoily
[3:01:23] <%DonatelloJose> We only tell him after he gets an ending and thinks he is done
[3:01:26] <%wolfofsound> let pat die and fall as he chooses
[3:01:30] <beetbo2> @thetechnicalraven mutltiple endings??
[3:01:38] <%spiritofmojave> let him continue to nerdgasm out
[3:01:39] <+Estuko> I'm actually very fond of pat figuring things out through trial and error and error and error and error :o
[3:01:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> haven't been caught up on streams. didn't pat say they were going doggo shopping at some point?
[3:01:59] <Tennochief> yes
[3:01:59] <hntronium> They did
[3:01:59] <%DonatelloJose> He is covering ground at a reasonable pace
[3:02:00] <CatmanIX> "this is a clock!"
[3:02:01] <%depressed_skeleton> what
[3:02:02] <thetechnicalraven> @beetbo2 I guess, chat keeps saying there's multiple

[3:02:08] <nexuion> What hints can we give?
[3:02:09] <%depressed_skeleton> what happened to the audio
[3:02:18] <hntronium> They won't name it dogmo
[3:02:19] <CatmanIX> nothing?
[3:02:21] <aimlesshealer> @CatmanIX That's almost up there with "THE BUTTERSCOTCH PIE!!!!"
[3:02:32] <$KnivesEve> dog's name will be baseball

[3:03:45] <beetbo2> @order_of_mystery what’s weird is that the launch is so soon. Like, is there time dilation on this game too? Cuz the space cannon JUST launched the probe

[3:09:37] <cronicconquest> LUL
[3:09:37] <fatalDestiny> Take it.
[3:09:40] <%TheStarbecue> spanking is choice tho
[3:09:43] <$Kenzo2000> Nothing good happens to me, thats free money
[3:09:44] <nexuion> Take it, become friends with a bunch of people who want to be spanked
[3:09:46] <%PlainSimpleTailor> They feel it when you nut
[3:09:47] <+Estuko> I'll sacrifice myself. :))))
[3:09:49] <+TheBitingIrish> I tried bunbun, wasn't impressed. Switched back to lizzer
[3:09:50] <$Order_of_Mystery> so seeing elmo? woolie gets spanked. donations? elmo gets spanked.
[3:09:52] <%ShichiNoBushi> Is the force of the spanking proportional to how fortunate the "good happenings" are?
[3:09:53] <%Unlimited_> @suikudo we rolled on it and he won
[3:09:56] <beetbo2> Kinky

[3:10:10] <%depressed_skeleton> what
[3:10:12] <%GoogleyGareth> Plural
[3:10:14] <Endocrom> Pretty soon you wouldn't have anyone to get "spanked" as they would begin to hate you.
[3:10:15] <Tennochief> chicken eye
[3:10:15] <%Broand> thats just not cricket
[3:10:16] <+Estuko> now was that on purpose on on accident

[3:10:36] <%depressed_skeleton> ok cool
[3:10:40] <thatthiefoverthere> video simulator time
[3:10:41] <masterfire23> I've had dried crickets they were crunchy
[3:10:41] <lethallylactic> DansGame
[3:10:42] <%crimsonharvest> you can get them pan fried in butter and seasonings it tastes like food
[3:10:43] <dekkitout> They're pretty tasty
[3:10:45] <%spiritofmojave> that does sound like some boonies shit
[3:10:45] <shinbuya> you enjoyed those crickets
[3:10:49] <$Order_of_Mystery> lobsters and other crustaceans are the insects of the sea, Chat.
[3:10:56] <thatthiefoverthere> time for more Kerbal's Mask
[3:10:58] <hntronium> Of course you did it for the candy
[3:11:00] <%Carlamagne> apatDab
[3:11:00] <+KursedKaiju> @TheSniperJoe anything with ranch is easy to eat
[3:11:01] <krymzen5> you'd think they are gross but they are p tasty
[3:11:01] <shinbuya> you went back for seconds
[3:11:06] <%TheSniperJoe> Dried crickets just taste like crunchy, and whatever you put on them.
[3:11:08] <%ShichiNoBushi> I imagine as long as it's not poisonous or diseased, anything is edible.
[3:11:11] <%TheSniperJoe> @KursedKaiju This is true.
[3:11:27] <%wolfofsound> I don't eat none of that shit
[3:11:28] <aimlesshealer> @ShichiNoBushi by that definition, glass is food
[3:11:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "I respect the first person to have eaten a mushroom."
[3:11:37] <dekkitout> I bet there's a Pillar Man in the Ash Twin
[3:11:40] <%depressed_skeleton> @spiritofmojave Oh the brother-in-law is gone now, he got divorced super duper hard when he got caught cheating. My dad is a lot more chill after a few decades & his own divorce.
[3:11:42] <%Svanyr> Svanyr subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[3:11:49] <+KursedKaiju> @TheSniperJoe I used to have a burning hatred for ranch, then I actually tried it and it changed my world.
[3:12:01] <krymzen5> i love that people thoght cranberries were deadly for decades
[3:12:07] <%wolfofsound> ranch is just mayo for salad
[3:12:09] <%TheSniperJoe> Ranch lyfe yo PogChamp
[3:12:09] <%ShichiNoBushi> @aimlesshealer Fair point.
[3:12:13] <$Order_of_Mystery> the arrows linking pictures to eachother have text too
[3:12:17] <Dovakhin573> that sounds like an innuendo
[3:12:29] <Siebersboy> ranch it up
[3:12:39] <thatthiefoverthere> i'll put my scout in your dark bramble
[3:12:53] <%TheSniperJoe> Tarantula is hard to eat though, it's...bristly.
[3:13:00] <%TheSniperJoe> And Scorpion is too "meaty" for me.
[3:13:04] <+KursedKaiju> @Order_of_Mystery wait really? how did I miss that.
[3:13:10] <krymzen5> does that make tardar sauce ranch for fish?
[3:13:16] <dekkitout> I bet scorpions taste like angry
[3:13:19] <%wolfofsound> @krymzen5 yes
[3:13:22] <Dovakhin573> I shall scout your "Outer Wilds" wink
[3:13:27] <%TheSniperJoe> @krymzen5 yes
[3:13:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @KursedKaiju good for you, man. all my first experiences with ranch were apparently spoiled ranch that was left out. Turns out, I love it, when not spoiled.
[3:13:28] <$Order_of_Mystery> @KursedKaiju its easy to miss. I didn't catch it until the end of my game
[3:13:38] <krymzen5> @wolfofsound i'm fine with this LUL
[3:13:47] <%spiritofmojave> @depressed_skeleton nice. honestly shit like that should barely fly with most people if they aren't saints/learn from it, moreover if he's a pos who cheats. glad your dad mellowed too! my dad went through a pretty rough divorce himself
[3:13:53] <%wolfofsound> Ranch makes me feel like I'm obese tbh
[3:13:58] <Noshi1234> lol
[3:14:00] <thatthiefoverthere> same
[3:14:05] <+jcenderion> Don't autopilot into the sun pat
[3:14:06] <%crimsonharvest> In space, debris from a station like that would either settle in an orbit nearby the original, or fall to the planet
[3:14:07] <+KursedKaiju> @Sphincter_Spelunker I think most foods taste better when not spoiled. tomatoBWL
[3:14:09] <%TheSniperJoe> I'm on Keto so full fat ranch makes me feel skinny.
[3:14:18] <dekkitout> Heliopause, here we come
[3:14:23] <%crimsonharvest> see look the chunks are still there
[3:14:35] <%depressed_skeleton> @spiritofmojave Yeah my dad had big OCD & a lot of other problems, hes really chilled out since the divorce but hes going through some rough times atm. I am doing what i can for him.
[3:14:40] <%TheSniperJoe> Gator is really tasty too.

[3:34:39] <+Spec7re> LUL
[3:34:40] <dukenux> This game looks like a better, more interesting No Man's Sky
[3:34:41] <%MelBrooksKA> @trfurkanrey18 It's a decent gaming system, a little old, but I definitely prefer the Game Boy Advanced spyCappa
[3:34:43] <+TheBitingIrish> @AngriestPat double gravity
[3:34:44] <%lizard0tm> Ankles destroyed
[3:34:47] <thegreenbenis> DOUBLE GRAVITY

[3:35:18] <Vlesh> Guy has Bro in his name
[3:35:18] <Louie_Salmon> @dukenux Well yeah, instead of an infinite universe that's functionally all the same, it's a designed universe with a story

[3:39:01] <Zombrocom> Our sun is too small to go supernova. It will expand until it consumes most neary planets, including earth, then shrink down into a dwarf star as it runs out of fuel. No boom
[3:39:06] <+Ell1ot> what were you supposed to do?

[3:45:34] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat Why not shoot a probe through the root, and follow that? That seems like a loose end
[3:45:37] <%Faustgesicht> naw, it had three chunks
[3:45:38] <$Order_of_Mystery> two... what?
[3:45:40] <+jcenderion> No there were three I think
[3:45:43] <Endocrom> Can you talk to some of those archeologist nerds and tell them about that?
[3:45:47] <Bearborg> you just weren't looking closely, it's always been 3 chunks
[3:45:50] <dukenux> There are... four lights

[3:49:39] <KaliasTV> Tornado shelter
[3:49:41] <+Tobatcie> @aztec50 this game is pretty long. Heard some people have spent like 30 hours on it
[3:49:43] <ape_hawk> all the best games do that
[3:49:47] <hntronium> safety
[3:49:52] <Vlesh> Wait, will those protect you from the sun explosion?
[3:49:57] <%Aztec50> ok neat
[3:49:59] <thetechnicalraven> Now that I think about it, I do recall a story on a podcast where Pat was speaking French with a taxi driver
[3:50:02] <KaseKaizer> it's like a free orbital elevator
[3:50:10] <%crimsonharvest> oh fuck my mind is getting blown again and again
[3:50:14] <%Faustgesicht> Naw, sun explosion kills all
[3:50:25] <natebud> I guess we know how they got it into space.
[3:50:35] <aimlesshealer> Those two plinths have high-five energy
[3:50:53] <+Despera__> Same tile combo
[3:50:54] <%Maids4lyfe> so I'm guessing the probe is what causes the supernova?
[3:50:58] <%ShichiNoBushi> "Pulling my locomotive limb" I like that.
[3:51:06] <KaliasTV> Seems like every matching stone gives the same text and viewpoint
[3:51:08] <CatmanIX> it's the control projection stone yet again
[3:51:11] <+jpivot> facetime baby
[3:51:14] <@lewdskeletor13> Deja Vu
[3:51:22] <%crimsonharvest> i think the projector is their video phone, and the record slabs are the text log of the conversation
[3:51:37] <beetbo2> Seeing pat solve the mystery makes me feel like the biggest boi
[3:51:42] <hd30ue01iohj> Huuurrrrgh
[3:51:43] <%Faustgesicht> oh no my brain NotLikeThis
[3:51:44] <+Spec7re> Nah its fine
[3:51:46] <Funkyfjord> this is super cool all over the place
[3:51:49] <+Estuko> LUL I'm gonna throw up
[3:51:49] <%Maids4lyfe> imagine playing this with vertigo
[3:51:49] <%SWFanatic> you spin me right around baby right around
[3:51:50] <+Spec7re> Just dont think about it
[3:51:53] <Vlesh> Hmm
[3:51:53] <BallinArbiter> Woolie would die
[3:51:55] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Want that mechanic for portal 3
[3:52:05] <%mh9s> NICE
[3:52:07] <aimlesshealer> Hooray!
[3:52:07] <Hawkbone_> YES
[3:52:07] <$Order_of_Mystery> :)

[3:52:08] <%SWFanatic> maybe this is portal 3
[3:52:09] <%Ne1son> YEE
[3:52:10] <hntronium> Nice
[3:52:11] <%Gray_skies1993> @Maids4lyfe the probe was made to find something called the "Eye of the Universe" but we don't know what that is yet
[3:52:12] <%foreverN2dust> Nice
[3:52:12] <+Bupkis7> Sweet
[3:52:13] <%galaxyswirl> YYYYEEEEEAAAAAA yeyeyey

[3:52:14] <CatmanIX> that's where your species come from innit?
[3:52:15] <Tennochief> nice
[3:52:15] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@CalderGaming) (warning)
[3:52:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> @maids4lyfe Doubt it. They're using the probe to look for the Eye of the Universe before the supernova happens. And they're exploiting the time loop to get it done.
[3:52:16] <laguerrilha> yeyeye
[3:52:16] <@lewdskeletor13> PogChamp

[3:52:54] <Vlesh> Hmm
[3:52:59] <CatmanIX> i knew it
[3:53:01] <natebud> Awful lot of z fighting in brittle hollow
[3:53:03] <+AlwaysBeGaming> hmm
[3:53:03] <CatmanIX> they made the cyclones
[3:53:04] <%TIME_PUNCHER> YO, do those control the cyclones?!?!?!
[3:53:05] <%crimsonharvest> their structure on brittle hollow seems to have models of the cyclone
[3:53:08] <%wujak> @Youwereeatenbyalid on pc. its also on xbox and in game pass
[3:53:11] <+Bupkis7> No
[3:53:13] <+jpivot> look at all that nice ice

[3:53:27] <%Gray_skies1993> *boom* there's some info
[3:53:30] <%SWFanatic> insight gained
[3:53:30] <HeadsHeldHigh> the current stop you going under, not the tornadoes
[3:53:34] <%demegodz> apatHat
[3:53:35] <@lewdskeletor13> sipsipDab EZ
[3:53:38] <%foreverN2dust> @MidnightBurst12 I thought it was the same studio at first, but it's not
[3:53:38] <Smart_ZaK1> That seems like a logic leap
[3:53:40] <+unknowingchuck> wonder if he couldve picked up that tab on the ground
[3:53:41] <KaseKaizer> he'll figure it out eventually
[3:53:46] <%Faustgesicht> 80% sure Paige wouldn't make it past the well for like 10 minutes
[3:54:01] <dekkitout> To the core, you say
[3:54:12] <HeadsHeldHigh> Those were just models of the tornadoes
[3:54:13] <%SWFanatic> the shreds you say
[3:54:17] <+Tobatcie> Brittle Hollow is one of the coolest places I’ve seen in a thing
[3:54:19] <CatmanIX> ahhh, just a model
[3:54:31] <%Faustgesicht> Soothes the fire
[3:54:40] <%crimsonharvest> whats the readout machine
[3:54:43] <$Order_of_Mystery> Brittle Hollow is LEGIT
[3:54:45] <Vlesh> I don't see
[3:54:56] <+jpivot> readout machine says how long since the cannon fired a probe
[3:54:58] <+Irkallu> Don't forget the statute island and the giant tornado
[3:54:59] <CatmanIX> @crimsonharvest you mean the Nomai translator?
[3:55:01] <%crimsonharvest> oh ok
[3:55:02] <$Order_of_Mystery> there's still a few more places here, tho, unless you wanna leave them
[3:55:04] <+Bupkis7> It's not creating the tornadoes, it's just a model
[3:55:11] <Hawkbone_> Brittle Hollow is one of my favorite planets
[3:55:13] <%Gray_skies1993> more and more of the mystery unfolds
[3:55:16] <%Faustgesicht> thanks trees SeemsGood
[3:55:18] <Tennochief> repair
[3:55:24] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> "Camelot!" "Well, it's only a model."
[3:55:25] <%crimsonharvest> no i mean the status log machine @CatmanIX but if its the same message as in space nbd
[3:55:27] <%odiemikes> describe this game in do X get Y

[3:56:11] <+Sestren413> They're clipping
[3:56:11] <masterfire23> oof looked bugged
[3:56:11] <aimlesshealer> That looks like a raid entrance
[3:56:12] <+Bupkis7> I don't think that's supposed to be like that
[3:56:12] <hntronium> is that a landing pad?
[3:56:19] <%demegodz> Nailed it
[3:56:20] <Bearborg> two islands smashed into each other
[3:56:22] <VigilantShield> sure that works

[3:57:25] <cache_22> I do not think I ever saw these islands together like this, did this happen to anyone else?
[3:57:30] <hd30ue01iohj> @AngriestPat Bad news, you got a glitch. Don't read too much into what's happening right now/
[3:57:30] <%crimsonharvest> theres a side door
[3:57:36] <Bearborg> never ever seen this happen
[3:57:37] <CatmanIX> memory statues eh?
[3:57:44] <%odiemikes> I got it, this is Frog Fractions 2
[3:57:45] <%crimsonharvest> right? these nerds are sneaking in a back door?

[3:57:50] <%RobotPancake> oooo I like this art style
[3:57:51] <%SWFanatic> the balloon, gotta get the balloon
[3:57:52] <masterfire23> should reset when the cyclone comes
[3:57:55] <$Order_of_Mystery> @cache_22 also never seen the statue island and bramble island this close either
[3:57:55] <%Reveresao> two islands on top of each other
[3:57:59] <Bearborg> two islands are on top of each other
[3:57:59] <haitakaa> LUL Pat broke the world
[3:58:01] <aimlesshealer> Oh dear
[3:58:06] <HeadsHeldHigh> I don't think you were able to shoot the probe through the flor
[3:58:06] <+jpivot> yeah those two islands arent upposed to intersect like this
[3:58:08] <LodiFrostbeard> huh? what glitch??
[3:58:08] <thegreenbenis> WORLD BROKE
[3:58:08] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Islands collided
[3:58:14] <+MidnightBurst12> huh
[3:58:16] <+jpivot> you CAN shoot your probe through that grate though
[3:58:16] <Varadox> @AngriestPat The glitch is the islands on top of each other.
[3:58:18] <+TheSaintJohn> lmao
[3:58:18] <$Order_of_Mystery> see that bramble part? that's supposed to be it's own thing
[3:58:19] <natebud> This is what it's like when world's collide.
[3:58:19] <CatmanIX> bramble island is on top of statue island aparently
[3:58:25] <dekkitout> What. Are. The. Odds.
[3:58:25] <%crimsonharvest> is that a glitch or is that just physics fucking it up when they get launched

[3:59:23] <+spheelman> getttttttt dunked on
[3:59:25] <+Despera__> 10/10 glitch
[3:59:28] <thegreenbenis> This game is amazing
[3:59:28] <@Pandora_Prime> is this the repeater game or the Bethesda game?
[3:59:32] <Smart_ZaK1> Dio dropped the island
[3:59:32] <%Faustgesicht> That's some anime fight shit: crushed by an island
[3:59:34] <$Order_of_Mystery> the island dunked you, lmao
[3:59:34] <JumbleJams> It's a feature
[3:59:38] <natebud> Grabbo dropped a house on you.
[3:59:38] <EuropantLamprey> Don't you just hate when the island you're standing on get rocketed out to space by a tornado?
[3:59:41] <Vlesh> That's what we call, good bugs, because they are fun
[3:59:42] <%foreverN2dust> it IS a feature
[3:59:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> The tornado Chaos Dunked you
[3:59:42] <thetechnicalraven> This game really just doesn't give a shit about physics LUL LUL LUL
[3:59:47] <%odiemikes> what suit will protect you from NATURE!
[3:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:51] <Louie_Salmon> This is the one that's not the obsidian game
[3:59:57] <thegreenbenis> DRINK WATER
[3:59:59] <%Faustgesicht> Not a glitch, but a feature
[4:00:03] <thegreenbenis> PAT DRINK WATER
[4:00:03] <%odiemikes> It's mother Earth getting revenge for your littering Pat
[4:00:04] <%MelBrooksKA> For once, Pat died not due to his own fuck ups
[4:00:11] <Endocrom> Bottom of the island eh?
[4:00:13] <hd30ue01iohj> Rebel cannon.
[4:00:18] <thetechnicalraven> Dio killed Pat
[4:00:21] <%Cthulos> gabbro became grabbo and grabbed that island and became throwwo and threw it at youwo
[4:00:35] <dekkitout> "DON'T fire the cannon" 'Imma fire the cannon- AT MAX-'
[4:00:40] <%SWFanatic> gabbro was throbbo and got in those guts
[4:00:45] <%crimsonharvest> so heres my theory about the time loop: when the statue noticed you, you got like matrixed or SOMA'd and now you're runnin a simulation to figure out the problem over and over
[4:00:45] <Hawkbone_> They meant the computer in the shio
[4:00:47] <Hawkbone_> ship
[4:00:48] <+jpivot> oh boy i cant wait for him to go to brittle hollow :)
[4:00:48] <dukenux> i like how the map also appears to be spirals
[4:00:48] <+Sestren413> Not the hud, the computer log
[4:00:50] <+Despera__> Yeah on the map it'll straight up say there's more
[4:00:51] <Bearborg> clues have an orange asterisk on them if you need to investigate more
[4:00:53] <Vlesh> Somebody says lots of things that may or may not be correct
[4:00:53] <hd30ue01iohj> Not the HUD, the ship's log. It's an asterisk.
[4:00:53] <CatmanIX> the question mark tuens into a picture when you got all the info i think
[4:00:58] <+Despera__> on the computer
[4:00:59] <%wujak> its an orange star thing
[4:01:02] <thetechnicalraven> Has anyone kept track of Pat's deaths?
[4:01:09] <%docpepperphd> It'll say on the computer that "there is more to explore here"

[4:13:52] <CatmanIX> aurHYPE
[4:13:53] <$Order_of_Mystery> clappin for ya right now, but you can't hear
[4:13:54] <+jcenderion> You could also just swim under but whatevs
[4:13:55] <+asgard147> find what you need pat before the sun blows
[4:13:59] <CatmanIX> aurHype
[4:14:02] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Fuck this game is RAD
[4:14:03] <Smart_ZaK1> I am . . . erect
[4:14:05] <dekkitout> I'd totally try it as a kid
[4:14:07] <%mh9s> just let the island fall on top of you kids
[4:14:09] <%wolfofsound> goatmen
[4:14:16] <%odiemikes> apatBig statue
[4:14:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "would you kindly" monkaS
[4:14:24] <+Bupkis7> You don't need the island to be thrown into the atmosphere to get into the workshop
[4:14:27] <CatmanIX> so anyone else notice these guys all seem to have just, died in place? suddenly?
[4:14:28] <dekkitout> So it is quantum entanglement
[4:14:34] <Tennochief> hmmmm
[4:14:38] <+Spec7re> hmmmmmmm
[4:14:40] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Quantum Immortality
[4:14:41] <+seaearthandsky> thats a fuckin ominous name
[4:14:47] <+Reizie_Etherealm> PIANO
[4:14:48] <natebud> Phlox off
[4:15:12] <Youwereeatenbyalid> And that's how the cycle works
[4:15:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it's the end of FMA
[4:15:24] <Rosy_Joan> bakoom?
[4:15:24] <dekkitout> The Ash Twin is the cloud
[4:15:26] <+Bupkis7> Mask sends the memories back
[4:15:30] <+asgard147> The sun pat
[4:15:35] <TheBlankAce> They're just uploading their saves to the cloud
[4:15:38] <%galaxyswirl> so is that statue the bro's statue now? so is that his soul now?
[4:15:42] <%wolfofsound> mask is the HD
[4:15:44] <Hawkbone_> It didn't mention anything about a cycle, it just stores memories. The cycle seems to be caused by something else
[4:15:46] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Steamplay is now enabled
[4:15:46] <%ShichiNoBushi> "Groovy!"
[4:15:51] <+sirgoos> this game on stadia?
[4:15:52] <natebud> The Ash Twin Kutcher
[4:16:06] <+TheBitingIrish> LUL
[4:16:11] <nexuion> the loop
[4:16:16] <$Order_of_Mystery> ooh, he figured it out fast!
[4:16:16] <Smart_ZaK1> So it probably failed, right?
[4:16:18] <+oOZtkOo> the cannon breaks and starts this thing up
[4:16:18] <%foreverN2dust> @natebud butterfly effect
[4:16:21] <dekkitout> Failsafe
[4:16:21] <KingVantq> @sirgoos xbox and epic store
[4:16:22] <gslayer14> shoot brain scans into space
[4:16:25] <%Gray_skies1993> well that explains why they activated
[4:16:29] <+Bupkis7> not quite
[4:16:42] <thatthiefoverthere> majora's mask reference lol
[4:16:45] <natebud> They just punk'd time and space
[4:16:46] <%crimsonharvest> which is the fate your boy feldspar has been in since forever ago when he got here
[4:16:53] <%crimsonharvest> or gabbro
[4:17:02] <+asgard147> monkaS
[4:17:02] <Smart_ZaK1> Awaken, My Masters
[4:17:05] <%Gray_skies1993> partially explained at least
[4:17:11] <%Psyramics> those are activated statues, there's 3 time looper
[4:17:16] <Rosy_Joan> the Majora Masks
[4:17:16] <Youwereeatenbyalid> GRANT US EYES So WE MAY SEE
[4:17:19] <Jack_of_No_Trades> gabbro u and who?
[4:17:19] <aimlesshealer> Who's the third guy I wonder?
[4:17:21] <+oOZtkOo> you gabbro and someone else
[4:17:21] <dekkitout> The space baphomets really thought of everything
[4:17:23] <Hawkbone_> So if one is you, and one is Gabbro, whos' linked to the third mask?
[4:17:25] <%galaxyswirl> so wait thats u and garbo's mask, who is the other mask???
[4:17:27] <+jpivot> three lit masks, one is you, one is gabbro, the other is for the thing that gets fired out of the cannon
[4:17:30] <CatmanIX> feldspar?
[4:17:33] <%TaifuDragon> the nomai they paired in that log
[4:17:34] <LodiFrostbeard> AND HE'S COMING FOR YOU
[4:17:36] <$Order_of_Mystery> tornado ride?
[4:17:36] <LodiFrostbeard> jk
[4:17:37] <hntronium> Maybe feldspar
[4:17:37] <thatthiefoverthere> space
[4:17:43] <%TaifuDragon> The third guy is Daz
[4:17:44] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Probably Finbar
[4:17:45] <Wan6Saber> tornado ride? LUL
[4:17:53] <thatthiefoverthere> tornado ride.
[4:17:54] <ZazzyDoesStuff> Do you think the other explorer dude is the third one?
[4:18:00] <+Bupkis7> The third one is the nomai paired in the log
[4:18:03] <+Fenlig> cough cough, zero g
[4:18:06] <%crimsonharvest> wait for the launch again?
[4:18:06] <%TaifuDragon> we literally JUST read a log about this
[4:18:13] <+jpivot> you gotta wait for a tornado
[4:18:19] <%bevyrage> there's a cyclone hold zone in here too
[4:18:24] <CatmanIX> pretty sure they're random pat
[4:18:25] <hntronium> It'll happen
[4:18:26] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Just swim out from under
[4:18:28] <+Despera__> Just wait
[4:18:32] <Louie_Salmon> Didn't you open a door?
[4:18:35] <Hawkbone_> @Bupkis7 The Nomai are all dead, they unlink when they die, otherwise all the other masks would be lit up
[4:18:38] <Jack_of_No_Trades> watch water level
[4:18:40] <+Reizie_Etherealm> He did open a door out
[4:18:41] <%foreverN2dust> you can always watch the shelters, I guess
[4:18:42] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat you opened a door outside
[4:18:42] <%bevyrage> door leads to outside
[4:18:47] <LodiFrostbeard> you can work the door from the inside @AngriestPat
[4:18:51] <%bevyrage> it's the busted entryway that he came to before
[4:18:51] <%crimsonharvest> so thats why the Ash Twin had a super shell on it? cause it stores the memories?
[4:18:53] <thatthiefoverthere> damn, 3 minutes
[4:19:01] <masterfire23> if you had your ship
[4:19:05] <VigilantShield> wont the dorr close when it resets?
[4:19:06] <+Despera__> @AngriestPat You can also fly the ship if you'
[4:19:13] <+Ririten> Pat you need air the breath /panic
[4:19:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> if only you had a jet pack or time stop

[4:20:26] <Dreigun> stein's gate all over again
[4:20:29] <LodiFrostbeard> every time you die, you actually die
[4:20:30] <aimlesshealer> This is the choice of Steins;Gate!~
[4:20:38] <thegreenbenis> HOLY SHIT

[4:20:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I am mad scientist. Is so coooool

[4:20:49] <thegreenbenis> STEINS GATO
[4:20:49] <Smart_ZaK1> That's some sci fi shit
[4:20:55] <tanarath> THUMP
[4:20:55] <hd30ue01iohj> Waited so long for a tornado to read that and all it did was fuck us in the mind.
[4:20:56] <%cvp5127> hacking to the gate
[4:20:57] <+jpivot> bunch of nerds getting philiosophical
[4:20:57] <StromkoPenguin> If that was all that was happening the game would end at start of the loop, because our consciousness would end from the very first death.
[4:21:00] <Hawkbone_> @Bupkis7 They didn't die immediately before the loop, otherwise the Hearthians wouldn't call them ancient, they were already dead by the time the Hearthians had evolved intelligence.
[4:21:01] <CatmanIX> well it is being rewritten, if you're taking different actions based on future knowledge
[4:21:02] <%galaxyswirl> isnt that the plot to steins; gate??? no really im serious
[4:21:06] <dragonify_> Oh god, time travel. It's about to get real fucky
[4:21:07] <%ShichiNoBushi> Steins; Grabbo
[4:21:09] <+MellowMute> bukKEK it's a statue of one of these
[4:21:12] <tanarath> You aren't.
[4:21:13] <$Order_of_Mystery> did you learn how to meditate, Pat?
[4:21:14] <%crimsonharvest> you could go hang out in the water until the island bumps into you
[4:21:16] <natebud> But that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy.
[4:21:18] <thegreenbenis> Won't be stuck long. @AngriestPat
[4:21:19] <%wujak> dont worry, youll be dead soon
[4:21:21] <+MidnightBurst12> embrace death
[4:21:21] <Louie_Salmon> Well, just gotta try and intercept that island
[4:21:23] <tanarath> Just wait in the PATH of your ship
[4:21:23] <hd30ue01iohj> Go look at the orb you saw.
[4:21:24] <LodiFrostbeard> time to die
[4:21:25] <Vlesh> Welp, guess I'll die
[4:21:26] <Tennochief> oh no
[4:21:28] <+Ririten> Pat suffocating is a painful way to go ;~;
[4:21:28] <%SWFanatic> take a deep breath
[4:21:28] <%ShichiNoBushi> I guess that solves your problem.
[4:21:28] <thatthiefoverthere> GO INTO THE OCEAN
[4:21:29] <Smart_ZaK1> Get to that tree?
[4:21:30] <thetruenicster> didnt you say the probe was under the island you're on?
[4:21:31] <+jpivot> jump into a tornado
[4:21:31] <%heyitsbrian> RIP in Peace!
[4:21:32] <%galaxyswirl> you could try going to a plant to get O2?
[4:21:32] <tanarath> Maybe find a tree.
[4:21:33] <+TheBitingIrish> fly Pat, fly
[4:21:35] <%Reveresao> the trees at the top
[4:21:36] <aimlesshealer> Go swimming
[4:21:37] <+Bupkis7> @Hawkbone_ The ash twin project was scrapped shortly before they died
[4:21:37] <$Order_of_Mystery> lmao
[4:21:37] <Hawkbone_> Remember to go in the big tornado
[4:21:39] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I wonder will I dream?
[4:21:42] <natebud> Just give a big thumbs up as you suffocated to death
[4:21:43] <VigilantShield> unless you're in the right place at the right time to get your shp then yeah
[4:21:49] <+MidnightBurst12> oh god
[4:21:49] <Wan6Saber> does this storm go on forever? @AngriestPat
[4:21:51] <%BioApple> spend all your fuel so you run out of oxygen faster
[4:21:51] <+Estuko> @PlainSimpleTailor FeelsBadMan will it hurt ?

[4:21:58] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Which is worse, knowing you're gonna go or just dying without knowing?
[4:22:00] <+TheBitingIrish> Twitch, wtf
[4:22:01] <Futurecity10> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[4:22:02] <Moonlight_Grimoire> I mean there's O2 on the top of the island
[4:22:03] <%Psyramics> found the probe receiver
[4:22:04] <%crimsonharvest> hey what the fuck did those metroids escape the ice?
[4:22:06] <+Despera__> Use the probe
[4:22:06] <+MidnightBurst12> why
[4:22:09] <Hawkbone_> Remember to go in the big tornado next time
[4:22:10] <zagoons> this planet activates a deep fear
[4:22:11] <+Tokanova> oh probes
[4:22:13] <+Tobatcie> Don’t forget you still need to explore that big tower
[4:22:15] <Smart_ZaK1> Looks like the lightning from before
[4:22:18] <CatmanIX> you gonna die in a minit
[4:22:21] <Wan6Saber> F
[4:22:22] <Tennochief> F
[4:22:23] <+Despera__> Do the tower up top

[4:23:44] <$Order_of_Mystery> @Youwereeatenbyalid I am pretty sure it is. I've always noticed the loud breath after suffocation/drowning
[4:23:46] <thatthiefoverthere> @VigilantShield pc xbox
[4:23:47] <CatmanIX> if this system were working properly, shouldn't you be going back /before/ the canon explodes? soon enough to stop it at least?
[4:23:47] <%Gray_skies1993> yeah I'm liking this game a lot as well
[4:23:48] <$Order_of_Mystery> yeyeyeye
[4:23:48] <%foreverN2dust> @VigilantShield pc, epic store...
[4:23:48] <%mh9s> RAMMING SPEED

[4:23:53] <laguerrilha> Its very interesting, but i never heard of it until tonight
[4:23:54] <BallinArbiter> Yeah this seems fantastic
[4:23:56] <KingVantq> @VigilantShield Xbox and Epic store
[4:23:57] <%TheStarbecue> We truly were the No Man's Sky
[4:23:57] <aimlesshealer> Damn.

[4:24:03] <JumbleJams> well ya hit it
[4:24:08] <+ColonelRozum> pat stop flying in at full speed jesus dude lol
[4:24:08] <dekkitout> Do it again!
[4:24:11] <LodiFrostbeard> THE WIND THAT EATS FLESH
[4:24:12] <Youwereeatenbyalid> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
[4:24:13] <%Psyramics> that is so rad every time
[4:24:13] <ScreamLord> Kinda getting No Man's Sky vibes from this
[4:24:14] <thatthiefoverthere> go to big towar
[4:24:17] <Wan6Saber> what a scary planet! athB
[4:24:18] <%AncelDeLambert> look at this Wind Waker shit
[4:24:23] <+angel949> big anxiety
[4:24:32] <+Ririten> Another happy landing
[4:24:33] <+MidnightBurst12> nailed it
[4:24:33] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Perfect
[4:24:35] <%Reveresao> I didn't figure out how to get here until the back third of the game
[4:24:35] <%BioApple> yeah if only link had a spaceship that game would be way easier
[4:24:35] <spacecatstreams> so what is this game? no man's sky with a narrative?
[4:24:36] <$Order_of_Mystery> this is a fun location. you're in for a good time
[4:24:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> Look at this Orokin tower
[4:24:37] <tanarath> PERFACT
[4:24:37] <%SWFanatic> 10/10
[4:24:37] <%demegodz> OOOp
[4:24:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pride500 Ride tornado. Get projection. Read lore. Get memory. Memory keep? Memory keep!
[4:24:38] <%AncelDeLambert> perfect
[4:24:39] <VigilantShield> ouch
[4:24:40] <Bearborg> clutch
[4:24:43] <CLiP2> For future plays, you can go talk to Gabbro and he can teach you to “meditate” so you can just skip to the next memory loop without having to off yourself.
[4:24:43] <+ColonelRozum> FailFish
[4:24:43] <tanarath> HAHAHAHAHAHA
[4:24:45] <Frolomeo> What happened to warframe?
[4:24:46] <tanarath> O RIGHT
[4:24:48] <hd30ue01iohj> Saved!
[4:24:49] <aimlesshealer> Forgot to change out of your jammies
[4:24:52] <natebud> Whoops, i suffocated
[4:24:53] <LodiFrostbeard> YES
[4:24:54] <Jack_of_No_Trades> yeah
[4:24:54] <%Faustgesicht> yeah
[4:24:54] <Wan6Saber> agreed
[4:24:54] <r_Foeburden87> was thinkign that
[4:24:54] <%crimsonharvest> a fun game
[4:24:55] <+jpivot> close call lol
[4:24:56] <%Maids4lyfe> lol
[4:24:56] <%AncelDeLambert> ... yep
[4:24:57] <+Estuko> YUP
[4:24:57] <+MidnightBurst12> agreed
[4:24:57] <$waltzqueen> YEAH
[4:24:58] <Tennochief> yes
[4:24:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Frolomeo thats tomorrow
[4:25:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> good?
[4:25:01] <%Gray_skies1993> YES
[4:25:01] <thatthiefoverthere> oh fuck
[4:25:02] <spacecatstreams> is this good? it looks good
[4:25:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> yep
[4:25:03] <%ShichiNoBushi> With multiplayer.
[4:25:04] <reonome> its a good game now at least
[4:25:05] <BallinArbiter> That’s correct
[4:25:06] <+Rodzzila> any way to explain this game in a nutshell?
[4:25:06] <+MellowMute> you mean a game? Kappa
[4:25:07] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Got em
[4:25:08] <thegreenbenis> YOU CAN TALK TO GABBRO
[4:25:09] <Smart_ZaK1> Can't argue there
[4:25:10] <%crimsonharvest> a poster or a lock
[4:25:13] <StromkoPenguin> It's much more impactful than NMS because the worlds are handcrafted with mysteries to unravel, instead of being randomly seeded with content.
[4:25:14] <+sirgoos> @generalscpatton big memory go up!
[4:25:17] <$Order_of_Mystery> no mans sky is an honest to god pile of shit compared to this imo
[4:25:17] <%crimsonharvest> a map?
[4:25:19] <+TheSaintJohn> No man sky is pretty cool right meow tho
[4:25:20] <tanarath> It might better now, Pat, the Dev kept fiddling with it.
[4:25:21] <natebud> some kind of weeb shit
[4:25:24] <aimlesshealer> It's a CLOCK
[4:25:24] <%Faustgesicht> hell Sea of theives could take lessons too
[4:25:25] <KaseKaizer> he's kooking at the gift shop 4Head
[4:25:28] <+Estuko> @StromkoPenguin pretty much lol
[4:25:28] <KaseKaizer> looking*
[4:25:32] <ScreamLord> From what I've heard No Man's Sky is good NOW but it was a garbage fire at launch
[4:25:33] <OldOnyx> this isn't rng based... witch is one of the reasons it doesn't suck
[4:25:34] <hd30ue01iohj> @Rodzzila Sun keeps exploding and killing you, figure out wtf is happening.
[4:25:35] <$cureneckbeard> More like no guy buy!
[4:25:41] <Hawkbone_> No Man's Sky is a very different type of game.
[4:25:41] <spacecatstreams> sea of thieves was really disappointing to me :(
[4:25:41] <%Psyramics> NMS wanted to be a sandbox, this clearly didn't
[4:25:47] <+Estuko> @ScreamLord took them long enough
[4:26:02] <$Order_of_Mystery> Outer Wilds is a sandbox, but a smaller, more refined sandbox
[4:26:04] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Pat literally need to get to the bottom of this (planet)
[4:26:04] <+spheelman> trees are OP in this world
[4:26:04] <natebud> I wonder if you could have landed on top of the statue
[4:26:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TheSaintJohn It took them 2 years to live up to their promises and other Devs copied their example. I can not by principle support them because of that
[4:26:12] <%crimsonharvest> ah how to die.txt
[4:26:17] <KaseKaizer> time for puzzles PogChamp
[4:26:18] <CLiP2> Quantum Entanglement!!!

[4:27:14] <%foreverN2dust> The game has spoken, time to shut up.
[4:27:25] <dekkitout> One time, I quantum punched a dude so hard he split and fell into 6 world lines Kappa
[4:27:31] <spacecatstreams> i'm gonna run my mouth because i don't know anythign about this game. if i make a spoil, it was in ignorance

[4:27:48] <%BioApple> I was probably at the fifteen hour mark when I finally explored this place, I gotta love how different everyone's playthroughs can be
[4:27:48] <hd30ue01iohj> @Rodzzila yep, every time you die you wake up back home again.
[4:27:49] <thegreenbenis> Bruh

[4:28:35] <reonome> fuckin tree
[4:28:35] <TheBlankAce> The trees are coming to get ya
[4:28:39] <dekkitout> How do I somehow constantly Crazy Talk/Bring Me to Life these things
[4:28:39] <thegreenbenis> BRUH
[4:28:40] <spinalwizard> That's Quantum mechanics, baby
[4:28:42] <$Order_of_Mystery> hmm...
[4:28:43] <%crimsonharvest> camera
[4:28:49] <Youwereeatenbyalid> !Tjat
[4:28:49] <+MidnightBurst12> that tree wants something
[4:28:51] <Mr_Rakjo> @crimsonharvest dude
[4:28:51] <+Reizie_Etherealm> image/
[4:28:51] <spinalwizard> Yes
[4:28:51] <CatmanIX> i see
[4:28:52] <Louie_Salmon> OH
[4:28:52] <+asgard147> PogChamp
[4:28:53] <thatthiefoverthere> HAHAHA
[4:28:53] <$Order_of_Mystery> eeyup
[4:28:55] <aimlesshealer> OHhhh
[4:28:55] <spacecatstreams> no fair, you changed the outcome by measuring it!
[4:28:57] <rearedlogarithm> Ahhhhh.
[4:28:58] <%bevyrage> image being depiction or rendering
[4:28:58] <StromkoPenguin> From what I can tell this quantum uncertainty stuff has nothing to do with real science, it was just really badly explained / picked up by quacks who popularized false interpretations.
[4:28:58] <%foreverN2dust> thats so cool
[4:28:59] <%ShichiNoBushi> Like weeping angels?
[4:28:59] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Image?
[4:29:00] <ScreamLord> That tree wasn't real
[4:29:00] <$Order_of_Mystery> as in...?
[4:29:01] <natebud> In conclusion: you see things that exist.
[4:29:01] <dekkitout> Now THAT'S quantum
[4:29:02] <laguerrilha> oh
[4:29:05] <%crimsonharvest> if you take a picture with teh camera will it be frozen in place cause the picture is on screeen
[4:29:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> I loveshoot out a camera
[4:29:08] <CatmanIX> take a picture, keep it on screen, stabilize object?
[4:29:08] <%Psyramics> @AngriestPat everything in our 3d world is a projection from a quantum state
[4:29:09] <tanarath> Science, Pat.
[4:29:10] <SpaceGuntank> the tree moves
[4:29:10] <+Despera__> look away
[4:29:14] <%bevyrage> correct
[4:29:18] <CalderGaming> taking the image counts as observing, yeah
[4:29:18] <Moonlight_Grimoire> because it's still observed
[4:29:18] <thatthiefoverthere> amazing
[4:29:19] <$Order_of_Mystery> :) :) :)
[4:29:19] <dekkitout> Well para-causal
[4:29:19] <rearedlogarithm> Nice.
[4:29:19] <Manderfuzz> @StromkoPenguin yup pretty much
[4:29:22] <%SwdVengeance> Observation defines it's existence
[4:29:22] <%crimsonharvest> oh god
[4:29:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> thinking. and puzzles
[4:29:23] <Jack_of_No_Trades> neat
[4:29:27] <rearedlogarithm> Go down!
[4:29:28] <+asgard147> that's neat
[4:29:29] <%crimsonharvest> im on the pat wavelength i need to calm down
[4:29:29] <Funkyfjord> HHHHHMMMMMMMM
[4:29:29] <aimlesshealer> Big IQ very big smarts
[4:29:30] <thegreenbenis> Neat
[4:29:30] <%Gray_skies1993> interesting
[4:29:31] <%TheStarbecue> cuz your eyes are like a photo with your mind
[4:29:31] <+Mr_Pylon> Big puzzle
[4:29:32] <VigilantShield> this is gonna make things o confusing
[4:29:32] <+Spec7re> Games need more puzzles like this
[4:29:33] <Louie_Salmon> And even have a camera gun
[4:29:33] <natebud> Schroedinger's Arch
[4:29:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> this is an entire game by itself
[4:29:34] <$cureneckbeard> galaxy brain

[4:29:42] <Mr_Rakjo> tomatoBrain tomatoBrain tomatoBrain tomatoBrain tomatoBrain
[4:29:43] <%crimsonharvest> so if you see it dont look away and take a pic
[4:29:46] <Youwereeatenbyalid> This reminds me of that modded portal 2 map
[4:29:48] <reonome> schrodingers rock
[4:29:55] <+jcenderion> Just take a picture of it lol
[4:29:56] <BrieIsMe> that's really cool
[4:29:57] <+Micalica> As long as you can see it, it exists.
[4:29:58] <hntronium> an eye
[4:30:03] <%TheStarbecue> schrodingers cock
[4:30:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> hey you. look at that
[4:30:11] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat try to take a picture of the moon maybe?
[4:30:11] <dekkitout> Superposition: closed
[4:30:11] <%furiousfurioso> tomatoBrain tomatoBrain tomatoBrain
[4:30:13] <+Estuko> 3F REEZE
[4:30:14] <whimsicallifestyle> thats some epistemology shit
[4:30:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its Waveform collapses it becomes a normal object when observed
[4:30:16] <ScreamLord> Schrodinger's Pet Rock
[4:30:17] <tanarath> They wan to fin the center of the universe, so they can go to it?
[4:30:20] <natebud> Ok im on board. this game is sweet
[4:30:24] <$Order_of_Mystery> cool, now lets add layers to this shit
[4:30:31] <%crimsonharvest> does it mean the blue dot
[4:30:35] <%docpepperphd> look at this game; being great n' shit
[4:30:38] <Smart_ZaK1> What is that blue thing?
[4:30:40] <+oOZtkOo> but wouldnt someone need to constantly observe it?
[4:30:45] <%crimsonharvest> you look ed away you fool
[4:30:48] <Funkyfjord> lmao
[4:30:49] <KaseKaizer> Jebaited
[4:30:50] <%galaxyswirl> LUL
[4:30:50] <%bevyrage> you had to put a picture of both
[4:30:51] <LodiFrostbeard> you stopped looking at it
[4:30:51] <VigilantShield> oh this is evil
[4:30:52] <+Bupkis7> You stopped looking at it
[4:30:52] <Smart_ZaK1> Ah, it lets you climb
[4:30:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> you have to take a picture of the crystal
[4:30:53] <aimlesshealer> Feck
[4:30:55] <%bevyrage> so then they don't move after
[4:30:56] <CatmanIX> take another picture
[4:30:56] <Us3rr> put a drone down instead
[4:30:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> then move the arch
[4:31:02] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I can understand how it works but I don't understand why it works that way
[4:31:02] <%SwdVengeance> Keep viewing it as you walk
[4:31:03] <Youwereeatenbyalid> *get fucked
[4:31:06] <tanarath> Big brain Pat, big brain time.
[4:31:08] <Tennochief> that's fucking rad
[4:31:14] <dzmi13> Wow your going pretty late :O
[4:31:17] <CatmanIX> lol, or just take another pic
[4:31:19] <$Order_of_Mystery> fuck me he figured that out WAY faster than I did! dammit pat
[4:31:19] <thegreenbenis> Bruh
[4:31:20] <laguerrilha> this is great
[4:31:23] <Mr_Rakjo> t101GANB t101ATTE
[4:31:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is amazing
[4:31:29] <dekkitout> The picture/feed of the object is enough to say the object exists there
[4:31:30] <%SwdVengeance> Quantum shit is for real science
[4:31:31] <ScreamLord> Quantum Horror

[4:32:19] <reonome> grind those gears pat
[4:32:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige is sweating right now and she doesn't know why
[4:32:27] <Jack_of_No_Trades> this requires both brain and attention. Get Piage
[4:32:28] <Bearborg> baba is quantum
[4:32:28] <StromkoPenguin> The real thing is there are particles that can only be observed by destroying them. Observing them doesn't destroy them or lock them into place.
[4:32:31] <%SvenHolgersson> Remember Pat Baba is You
[4:32:32] <%crimsonharvest> one day video games are going to unlock the psionic powers among us
[4:32:33] <+jcenderion> Take a picture downwards
[4:32:35] <$cureneckbeard> now you're thinking with portles
[4:32:43] <StromkoPenguin> Still a really cool game mechanic though.
[4:32:43] <ZazzyDoesStuff> Take a picture of one crystal
[4:32:45] <Siebersboy> take a picture of just the one next to you
[4:32:45] <$Order_of_Mystery> ooh, so close
[4:32:47] <VigilantShield> oh no
[4:32:47] <%SvenHolgersson> but you is not Baba
[4:32:51] <+jpivot> forget about the other side
[4:32:54] <%ShichiNoBushi> Take a picture of only the middle mone.
[4:32:54] <$Order_of_Mystery> chat hush, let him figure it out
[4:32:56] <%foreverN2dust> you are the pilot
[4:32:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> but the rock ceases to be

[4:34:28] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Quantum Pilgrimage
[4:34:30] <%SWFanatic> lol
[4:34:33] <+Bupkis7> There are three QUANTUM RULES!
[4:34:34] <+jcenderion> Take out that signal scope boy!
[4:34:38] <natebud> I like that you didn't gain an ability, just a tutorial.
[4:34:39] <thatthiefoverthere> this is cool as hell
[4:34:41] <LodiFrostbeard> QUANTUM HAAJ
[4:34:41] <Endocrom> Now go take pictures of rocks back home
[4:34:43] <hd30ue01iohj> @jcenderion He already did.
[4:34:45] <%crimsonharvest> ok listen, in a real situation, would *remembering* the quantum thing count as viewing an image? in your brain there's no difference between a memory and the real thing
[4:35:06] <Youwereeatenbyalid> oh it is the gift shop
[4:35:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> @crimsonharvest no observation MUST happen
[4:35:08] <+jcenderion> You got magic rocks to find!
[4:35:09] <+jpivot> naw memory isnt accurate enough
[4:35:11] <+TheBitingIrish> memories aren't very reliable
[4:35:12] <+Micalica> @crimsonharvest no, specifically the concept is that you can't both know where an electron is and what it's doing
[4:35:13] <+Reizie_Etherealm> You don't gain any special power, just knowledge of what is already around you
[4:35:13] <tanarath> Observation.
[4:35:14] <Smart_ZaK1> A memory is not a measurement
[4:35:16] <+timblenaut> memory is imperfect
[4:35:17] <+jpivot> you can totally remember things that are fake as heck
[4:35:17] <StromkoPenguin> None of your memories are a real thing, you're playing Telephone with yourself.
[4:35:21] <EuropantLamprey> In real life "Observing" isn't what you think it is
[4:35:21] <reonome> memories can be fake
[4:35:22] <%bevyrage> spacial memory =/= observation
[4:35:23] <CatmanIX> congratulations, you are now a master of quantumn puzzling
[4:35:25] <+Ashboldt> overload
[4:35:25] <Endocrom> The ones back from the begining of the game
[4:35:26] <$Order_of_Mystery> that's a good question, Crimson. would someone with a photographic memory be able to lock these things in place?
[4:35:28] <Manderfuzz> @crimsonharvest none of this is stuff is real lol
[4:35:28] <%bevyrage> it's a recollection
[4:35:31] <+Ashboldt> Pat is overload
[4:35:33] <%crimsonharvest> a 2d photo isn't the real thing either, not even close
[4:35:34] <+Spec7re> This is a good game
[4:35:34] <cache_22> There is the Quantum channel in the signalscope
[4:35:41] <$Order_of_Mystery> mmhmm
[4:35:45] <natebud> And this is an ability you could have been doing from the beginning. PogChamp
[4:35:46] <$Order_of_Mystery> thats right there, look at that!
[4:35:47] <shadowstep1998> tutorial over, now entering the real game
[4:35:47] <LodiFrostbeard> HE FIGURED IT OUT
[4:35:49] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat any DRK swords from Shadowbringers you're a big fan of design wise?
[4:35:54] <aimlesshealer> @crimsonharvest "Looking" and "comprehending" or "imagining" are close enough
[4:36:02] <thetechnicalraven> My brain fucking hurts
[4:36:07] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Speaking of fake memories. What about that time the warrior of light recalls leviathan having 2 heads lol
[4:36:09] <thatthiefoverthere> there it is
[4:36:12] <$Order_of_Mystery> oh hey there it was!
[4:36:14] <+jcenderion> Just spin around till you see it
[4:36:14] <MartyFun11> And it's gone
[4:36:16] <+oOZtkOo> but what do we want with the moon? it looked barren from what i could tell
[4:36:16] <thatthiefoverthere> oh lol it's gone
[4:36:19] <+jpivot> there it is!
[4:36:22] <+jpivot> oh he missed it
[4:36:22] <laguerrilha> is that a mini sun?
[4:36:23] <ssks123> you just missed it pat
[4:36:24] <Tennochief> You had the upgrade the entire time
[4:36:24] <LodiFrostbeard> lol, he didn't notice
[4:36:25] <$Order_of_Mystery> there it is!
[4:36:26] <Youwereeatenbyalid> I saw it
[4:36:28] <CatmanIX> he didn't even notice aurLUL
[4:36:35] <%BioApple> the real time stop was within you all along
[4:36:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Fenrirlives he stated a few times he likes the guillotine of tyrants or something along that line
[4:36:36] <%ECRead> do i get a quantum bagel before i have to leave on my quantum pilgrimage to find a quantum wife and start a quantum family and quantum kids? ....quantum
[4:36:37] <%crimsonharvest> so you can just summon the moon around by scanning the sky with your eyes huh
[4:36:39] <LodiFrostbeard> THERE IT IS
[4:36:42] <Hawkbone_> The quantum moon can only appear in orbit of 3 specific planets, figure out what they are.
[4:36:45] <%Maids4lyfe> didn't know this was a blind run Kappa
[4:36:46] <%Psyramics> its by giants deep!

[4:38:47] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Is that moon the hypothetical 10th planet SCP?
[4:38:47] <LodiFrostbeard> hehe, i went through most of the game saying shit like that
[4:38:49] <$Order_of_Mystery> distance doesn't matter, as long as you have A picture, it will quantum lock
[4:38:50] <%ShichiNoBushi> Land on quantum moon; look up at sky; in space now.
[4:38:50] <+jpivot> "one more thing" definitely not your last words
[4:38:50] <+Bupkis7> You need the other two QUANTUM RULES!
[4:38:55] <%Romulus1213> !uptime
[4:38:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 38m.
[4:38:56] <+TheBitingIrish> doodOne
[4:38:56] <Youwereeatenbyalid> back at it again on the surface of the moon
[4:38:59] <%BioApple> did pat ever see the moon blink in and out during the wake up scene? It's real cool foreshadowing for this
[4:39:05] <CatmanIX> is this game an SCP?
[4:39:08] <BallinArbiter> Just don’t stop looking at it while you’re on it
[4:39:09] <Hawkbone_> Hey pat, there's an eject button in the ship, just in case
[4:39:12] <+Mr_Pylon> This game is one of the worst 'but just one more thing' but in a great way
[4:39:15] <+timblenaut> helmet passing over eyes might break it
[4:39:15] <dekkitout> I got two other quantum rules right here; lefty and right hook!
[4:39:20] <hd30ue01iohj> @AngriestPat No, that's not going to work.
[4:39:22] <Us3rr> @bioapple I've never noticed that
[4:39:25] <StromkoPenguin> Don't overthink the quantum stuff, all it amounts to is if you've got a camera on a thing then it's locked into the state it's in. In reality, you've never directly observed a single thing in your entire life, you've only perceived reflected light, so 'observation' is not real in a physics sense.
[4:39:28] <+jpivot> you got four eyes
[4:39:32] <%clausover> clausover subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[4:39:38] <%Reveresao> maybe move it away from the sun

[4:41:33] <LodiFrostbeard> i love this fucking game
[4:41:33] <%crimsonharvest> and these assholes built stuff on it
[4:41:34] <dekkitout> More people need to know about this game
[4:41:35] <%Gray_skies1993> that's neat
[4:41:38] <+Bupkis7> It's not a planet, it's a moon!
[4:41:41] <+jpivot> hell yesssss
[4:41:44] <+Tokanova> heh
[4:41:45] <%crimsonharvest> its a menu?
[4:41:51] <+Tokanova> darkness
[4:41:51] <+jpivot> will he figure it out tho
[4:41:57] <%Valdorick> Well yeah, its called the quantum moon, not the quantum-only-surface-of-the-moon
[4:41:58] <thetechnicalraven> Moon or planet, fuck whatever this quantum object is
[4:42:00] <+jcenderion> You can try
[4:42:01] <+Tokanova> he'll have to take some time
[4:42:02] <+Reizie_Etherealm> SIXTH LOCATION?
[4:42:03] <+Estuko> Sixth location? monkaS ?
[4:42:03] <+TheSaintJohn> RECALL it
[4:42:04] <aimlesshealer> Your brain isn't buff enough
[4:42:05] <rearedlogarithm> You could probably brute smart it.
[4:42:07] <tanarath> RECALL PAT
[4:42:09] <+Bupkis7> Three QUANTUM RULES!
[4:42:09] <Youwereeatenbyalid> 2 REMAIN
[4:42:09] <+Irkallu> Just guess
[4:42:10] <natebud> You need more locations
[4:42:11] <%crimsonharvest> so can you use the slider in the wall? the selector thing for the planets?
[4:42:12] <+jcenderion> TRY
[4:42:12] <tanarath> RECALL
[4:42:13] <+Reizie_Etherealm> 2 more!
[4:42:16] <+Tokanova> no spoilers folks
[4:42:17] <Mr_Rakjo> DONT SPOIL YALL PLS
[4:42:18] <LodiFrostbeard> you're missing 2
[4:42:19] <Vlesh> Do Pat brute forcing
[4:42:19] <%Reveresao> the symbols mason, what does it mean
[4:42:20] <$Order_of_Mystery> you are still missing a few steps. but you are WAY closer to solving it
[4:42:23] <thegreenbenis> NO SPOIL
[4:42:23] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat entanglement and the 6th
[4:42:25] <+punit216> 2 more lessons
[4:42:25] <+jcenderion> BIG BRAIN
[4:42:26] <EuropantLamprey> Just quantum tunnel through the wall
[4:42:26] <hd30ue01iohj> @AngriestPat Unidentified signal nearby.
[4:42:27] <thatthiefoverthere> this is great
[4:42:27] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat entanglement and the 6th location
[4:42:34] <%crimsonharvest> camera doesn't work in here? is that whats happening?
[4:42:34] <$Order_of_Mystery> i promise you the answers will come, but not right now
[4:42:36] <Endocrom> Some stuff you must learn on Brittle Hollow and the Brambles I guess.
[4:42:37] <LixFury> YOU NEED TO KNOW
[4:42:37] <+jpivot> how is your "one more thing" thing now!!
[4:42:41] <%Fenrirlives> can't wait to hear about this on the podcast lol
[4:42:41] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Step 1: Be an Animorph
[4:42:41] <%wujak> well, youve only gone to 1 other planet, so there is still a lot to explore
[4:42:44] <+asgard147> monkaS
[4:42:45] <%SWFanatic> something something boom boom
[4:42:47] <$Order_of_Mystery> unless you try and brute force
[4:42:47] <+MidnightBurst12> monkaS
[4:42:48] <tanarath> There are pictures, Pat.
[4:42:54] <Ner234> That's spooky
[4:42:56] <%galaxyswirl> SINGING
[4:42:58] <thegreenbenis> Spooky
[4:43:01] <%Gray_skies1993> that's some eerie shit
[4:43:01] <natebud> magic must defeat magic
[4:43:05] <%crimsonharvest> so maybe on this moon you can find otu more
[4:43:07] <+Spec7re> Ding ding ding
[4:43:09] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Quantum break got nothing on this quantum physics shit
[4:43:16] <laguerrilha> is that bellow the island?
[4:43:16] <+jcenderion> No
[4:43:18] <+Bupkis7> No
[4:43:20] <reonome> no
[4:43:20] <$Order_of_Mystery> you have been to one of the three locations
[4:43:20] <lautalocos> no

[4:43:36] <Mr_Rakjo> yes
[4:43:38] <+Sestren413> Yes
[4:43:39] <%foreverN2dust> Be careful asking chat for things.
[4:43:39] <Bearborg> literally any objective in the game is doable on the first loop
[4:43:39] <natebud> Recall the rules of quantum guessing
[4:43:41] <+punit216> yes kinda
[4:43:42] <%BioApple> EVERYTHING is "just information"
[4:43:42] <+Bupkis7> You wouln't beat the game by beating this puzzle
[4:43:42] <%depressed_skeleton> baba is you
[4:43:43] <JumbleJams> oh no the ship
[4:43:43] <aimlesshealer> Quantum chat says yes and no
[4:43:43] <+jcenderion> Look at what is available to you
[4:43:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Seanster5130 shame it won't come out for a nother year
[4:43:47] <$Order_of_Mystery> once you have the knowledge, you can beat the game with the time given to you
[4:43:48] <LodiFrostbeard> kinda
[4:43:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> @micalica Oh fuck, for real?
[4:43:49] <%wujak> if you knew what to do, you could do it
[4:43:50] <+jpivot> baba is thought
[4:43:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> didn't take a photo of ship
[4:43:54] <reonome> quantum chat LUL
[4:43:54] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Recall the basics of quantum CQC
[4:43:54] <+MidnightBurst12> this game is dope
[4:43:57] <+The_Trash_Goblin> Yes
[4:43:57] <%Reveresao> part of the 6 location you probably not going to get
[4:43:57] <Youwereeatenbyalid> OH NO
[4:43:58] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Schrodinger's Ending
[4:43:59] <%crimsonharvest> and the reason its telling you to recall it is because these are memories from the future like the log said
[4:44:00] <KaseKaizer> technically this area is optional
[4:44:03] <+Micalica> oh god my heart fucking leapt
[4:44:03] <EuropantLamprey> Just quantum tunnel through' the wall
[4:44:03] <laguerrilha> the one on the right looks like the core of the planet
[4:44:05] <$Order_of_Mystery> you still have more to learn
[4:44:06] <%BioApple> close quantum combat
[4:44:08] <$waltzqueen> ....BA....Ba....
[4:44:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Jebaited

[4:55:22] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Pat fall down, go boom
[4:55:22] <dekkitout> We need even MORE eyes!
[4:55:23] <Mr_Rakjo> 404 pat.exe too tired for this shit
[4:55:24] <%weissguard> That's a fun one.
[4:55:25] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Holy. Fuck.
[4:55:25] <Jack_of_No_Trades> for that thing you were carrying
[4:55:26] <Bearborg> UH OH
[4:55:26] <%galaxyswirl> that reset that entire loop
[4:55:27] <+p4ntless> this game goes some god damn places
[4:55:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> It doesn't matter now
[4:55:28] <+MidnightBurst12> too much brain juice
[4:55:28] <%Romulus1213> Pat no
[4:55:29] <EuropantLamprey> This gsme is turning pat into paige
[4:55:29] <+jpivot> :^)
[4:55:29] <%docpepperphd> good game tho
[4:55:31] <beetbo2> LUL this game man
[4:55:32] <$Order_of_Mystery> i know exactly what you are going thru
[4:55:32] <%Romulus1213> Pat Stop
[4:55:34] <+jcenderion> Pat no you already reset its fine
[4:55:34] <silverira> baba is brain
[4:55:34] <tanarath> For the things you're holding.
[4:55:34] <thegreenbenis> Pat is like he is in 2001. @AngriestPat
[4:55:35] <%docpepperphd> is too late
[4:55:36] <BallinArbiter> Pat has eyes on the inside
[4:55:36] <%Faustgesicht> hey good one chat
[4:55:36] <$cureneckbeard> pat drink RED BULL instead of sleep
[4:55:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> pat stop
[4:55:38] <Youwereeatenbyalid> loop reset tho
[4:55:38] <aimlesshealer> Pat pls
[4:55:40] <Louie_Salmon> For the special thing you found, but whatevs
[4:55:42] <Youwereeatenbyalid> UHHH
[4:55:43] <+jcenderion> well shit check your logs then
[4:55:43] <Endocrom> Well done. Go sleep now.
[4:55:44] <%galaxyswirl> so nothing you just did got saved @AngriestPat
[4:55:45] <aimlesshealer> You lost your stone majiggy
[4:55:46] <hd30ue01iohj> Review ship's log before you quit for the night?
[4:55:47] <viciousgrim> paige of pat
[4:55:49] <$Order_of_Mystery> this game is mind bending, off-beat genius
[4:55:50] <%Valdorick> Baba is you/not you until baba is observed by an outside source.
[4:55:52] <ape_hawk> keep playing, patrick
[4:55:53] <%galaxyswirl> i assume
[4:55:53] <%wujak> too late, but you picked up one of those projection stones at the white hole station, but never found a place to read/view it
[4:55:54] <$Order_of_Mystery> also yes, check your ship'ls logs
[4:55:55] <+oOZtkOo> you had the twin ash project stone but didnt read it
[4:55:59] <+Mr_Pylon> Ship log or done for night?
[4:56:00] <ape_hawk> after all, time is relative
[4:56:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> to be fair this is rather high concept shit
[4:56:02] <%Romulus1213> Pat sleep
[4:56:05] <TheBlankAce> You already quit so you would have to go back to the teleporter to get the item
[4:56:10] <hntronium> Tim already paid for my game
[4:56:10] <aimlesshealer> I wish Baba was the protagonist of this game
[4:56:12] <BallinArbiter> Sleeeep
[4:56:14] <+Fenlig> captains log
[4:56:14] <hntronium> He's paying for all of us
[4:56:14] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Go to sleep small pat
[4:56:15] <BaronVonDickButt> big Drain Bablage
[4:56:20] <tanarath> Just gotta go to the White Hole.
[4:56:21] <ape_hawk> this game is pretty GOTY worthy, honestly
[4:56:33] <%galaxyswirl> oof
[4:56:34] <Sol_Install> Gravity Cannon!?
[4:56:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> @aimlesshealer TIME IS FUCK
[4:56:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> the only reason I understand it at all is because I was super into it
[4:56:42] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Quantum is purple, nice
[4:56:48] <laguerrilha> @doc_ock_rokc it would make sense since going to the past isnt possible, but going to a similar universe with delayed time is just transport
[4:57:02] <aimlesshealer> @GeneralSCPatton MOON is OBSERVE
[4:57:18] <Hawkbone_> What if the Ash Twin project SUCCEEDED?!
[4:57:18] <BaronVonDickButt> Crack the Continumumum code!
[4:57:28] <Endocrom> !uptime
[4:57:29] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 57m.
[4:57:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> @laguerrilha but data is not physical if one can send data through time then you can send memories to a past self
[4:57:34] <$lacroximus> Dark Bramble time!
[4:57:43] <%demegodz> There's More to Explore here
[4:57:47] <shadowstep1998> tell us your thoughts @AngriestPat
[4:57:50] <Hawkbone_> It seems the colors relate to the planet/moon.
[4:58:18] <+jpivot> the colors relate to subject matter
[4:58:21] <+daleandhisbeard> Obviously this is the work of Stienz Gate
[4:58:29] <ape_hawk> question: how do we even know the gender of these nomai?
[4:58:31] <+jpivot> quantum stuff is purple, ash twin project stuff is another color, etc
[4:58:35] <BaronVonDickButt> This game is fucking bullshit and I absolutely love it
[4:58:42] <%Propowers> The music and ambiance in this game is so calm and soothing is enough to make anyone drowsy Basically Space Asmr
[4:58:53] <%Valdorick> Pat go to bed!
[4:58:58] <Hawkbone_> Quick! Hit the eject button
[4:59:05] <TheBlankAce> Oh the hints are on the log that's good
[4:59:06] <%Gray_skies1993> man this shit is all kinds of crazy awesome
[4:59:06] <+MidnightBurst12> bed time
[4:59:07] <tanarath> I like how the game is...not safe, but safe enough..
[4:59:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 100 billion nomai dead. quantum is fuck
[4:59:11] <ape_hawk> pat, come back to this tomorrow or saturday
[4:59:11] <+jcenderion> Hi elmo

[4:59:18] <+Despera__> @AngriestPat Are you gonna play it tomorrow?
[4:59:19] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Maybe you gotta quantum entangle the sixth location into appearing or into existence
[4:59:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> but BABA~!
[4:59:22] <natebud> Pat is hurt
[4:59:22] <$Bluwizard21> and i missed all of it

[4:59:39] <+dkcurt> this shit is...just wild
[4:59:39] <thatthiefoverthere> quantum elmo
[4:59:42] <Hawkbone_> @AngriestPat In case you need it in the future, the ship has an eject button in the control panel where you sit
[4:59:42] <%Valdorick> And be sure to write down whatever you dream about if you dream about this game - just to fuck with yourself even more.
[4:59:44] <Jack_of_No_Trades> this seems neat, have a good night
[4:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 5 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 20oz (600mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:59:55] <Ominnous> rooWut Stinking City?
[4:59:56] <%foreverN2dust> Sinking city will be pretty good too
[4:59:57] <%docpepperphd> Pat what you think??
[4:59:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> Awww no Weekly Grind?
[4:59:59] <BaronVonDickButt> @AngriestPat isnt sinking city like Fallout levels bugged?

[5:00:16] <thegreenbenis> @AngriestPat HERE ABOUT KYOANI?
[5:00:16] <$Order_of_Mystery> so we have: quantum entanglement, theory of FTL shit, sending memories back into the past with space magic, and some other crazy bullshit that Pat has yet to find!
[5:00:18] <natebud> Sinking City is eurojank goodness.

[5:04:04] <Hawkbone_> I feel like I just watched an entire game right now, but we aren't even halfway through...I think.
[5:04:27] <thatthiefoverthere> @Hawkbone_ a lot to go, actually
[5:04:32] <thatthiefoverthere> we're honestly like....

[5:05:02] <hntronium> So Woolie wasn't talking about Grid
[5:05:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Grip the was game Woolie couldn't remember on the last podcast
[5:05:18] <CopperTucker> @AngriestPat it was plagiarism drama again, because fuck that noise
[5:05:19] <thatthiefoverthere> This is one of those games where you either intuitively beat the game quickly or you have to bump into everything, and, consequently, lean all the cool shit
[5:05:20] <worldbrand> hell yeah sees ya
[5:05:28] <Tennochief> woot
