[0:32:36] <%ElenaManetta> General nerd culture creates smell monsters
[0:32:37] <%waifoong98> dirty bastards urghhhhh
[0:32:38] <+ArcLifth> Isn't that all card game events having smell piles
[0:32:39] <Bouldus> now Swedish Kermit, thats a weird Kermit Kappa

[0:32:42] <+Deadbulky> Word this careful Pat LUL
[0:32:44] <%Prevot> I activate Pot of Smell!
[0:32:44] <%lewdskeletor13> Is Canadian Kermit Paige?
[0:32:45] <+ssulcer> All games would create smell monsters given the opportunity
[0:32:45] <PSI_Guy95> same with any obessive fan culture
[0:32:46] <%Svanyr> too many basements
[0:32:46] <%laserbeaming> @Grandma_Amari oh snap

[0:32:55] <%TenderBabyBacon> TenderBabyBacon subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Wohoo, Stream baby.
[0:32:56] <thwak> pat's trying to figure out how real to go
[0:32:59] <+ArcLifth> Magic has this issue as well
[0:32:59] <gustavozxd> they want to play the game so much that they don't care?
[0:32:59] <yodajr99> wave dashing creates smell
[0:33:00] <Desertfishing> was about to say sounds like melee
[0:33:00] <Greedboyz> Pat doesn't know his cardboard crack
[0:33:01] <MrNoobMcSalt> probably has something to do with tight knit groups playing in their basements
[0:33:02] <770megaman> are u gonna play you di oh?
[0:33:03] <%Prevot> it's the CRTs
[0:33:04] <%browengazebolo> IT's an overlap with magic, "biological warfare" basically stink out your opponents.
[0:33:05] <%ElenaManetta> tHAT WAS SO CUTE
[0:33:05] <Ion_Laser> some folks spend too much time mastering the mechanics of the game instead of showering
[0:33:06] <pmtriox> did you in fact know that you are what they call a vampire in this game?
[0:33:07] <%spiritofmojave> ey I'm late, how're you guys doing apatGib
[0:33:13] <dabirSA> at my local yugioh store it's obvious that a lot of the regular players have some sort of developmental disorder
[0:33:13] <LokimenD> too much money on packs to pay the water bill
[0:33:14] <+SmoochSpider> Laziness
[0:33:15] <%ElenaManetta> That stupid smirk and then went to a serious answer
[0:33:16] <%joylent_blue> ohhhhh
[0:33:20] <AmericanaRed> Melee: No gurls allowed
[0:33:20] <dabirSA> possibly autism, I'm not qualified to say
[0:33:24] <%lewdskeletor13> @spiritofmojave Howdy apatDab
[0:33:24] <%AncelDeLambert> relegated to the bathroom shower stall
[0:33:26] <dabirSA> but there's something going on there
[0:33:28] <%Hammerknife> it's antisocial autism
[0:33:30] <dabirSA> and they *reek*
[0:33:30] <PSI_Guy95> so we need Melee Arcade Version is what you're saying
[0:33:33] <%Dio_TR> Pat has THE HIGHGROUND
[0:33:37] <Rhinoprotoss> ??? no locals
[0:33:38] <%spiritofmojave> @lewdskeletor13 sipsipDab
[0:33:42] <Bouldus> the average player of Melee thinks bathing is optional Kappa
[0:33:45] <%joylent_blue> so they're socially inept is what you're saying
[0:33:50] <%Kisabuza> Kisabuza converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[0:33:50] <%skullnaught> if i go a day without a shower i feel disgusting
[0:33:50] <%BonewheelVanguard> Few are worse than the Card Fight Vanguard smellites
[0:33:50] <PKHTjim> So you say presentability.
[0:33:51] <%PlainSimpleTailor> How many good boy points does a melee player need to get his chicken tendies?
[0:33:58] <RupanSen> I don't know, arcades are pretty smelly
[0:33:58] <%Dio_TR> People still play Melee at my college CRT are hard to find
[0:33:58] <dabirSA> I have autism and I'm obsessive about being clean, I know it's not all autistic people, but it is common for autistic people to have trouble with stuff like regular bathing
[0:33:59] <%ElenaManetta> But then why melee players specifically and not ALL general multiplayer games like Counter Strike or Quake?
[0:34:00] <%Jetsfantasy> More thuggary
[0:34:04] <Desertfishing> what makes something hiphop
[0:34:04] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Hip Hop > Friendlies
[0:34:06] <Floofiie> Arcades were literally gambling quarters
[0:34:06] <thwak> cmonBruh more hip hop?

[0:34:32] <a1u5> Play magic arena
[0:34:34] <dabirSA> especially if they only see it as a social courtesy, cause social courtesies seem pointless
[0:34:35] <Bouldus> yugioh is poor mans magic
[0:34:35] <%stabbityrabbit> So public shaming will fix the FGC? Got it!

[0:34:48] <%Dio_TR> People at my college be using them Engenieering lessons to fix CRT shits dumb
[0:34:49] <770megaman> card game is a lifestyle not a culutre'
[0:34:50] <Ion_Laser> uh oh...

[0:34:54] <starotter70> I played magic back in middle school, went to a tournament...I stopped playing Magic
[0:34:55] <+InstiGaitan> fuckingamanda
[0:34:56] <%GarbageNirvana> It's called Speed Stick, it's not expensive
[0:34:58] <ChoculaUltra> there was a time where synchro-monsters threatened to flatline the game, but some how, some way, YGO is still fucking in it.
[0:34:58] <+SmoochSpider> That guy who would kneel and take selfies behind asscracks is a hero

[0:36:55] <gustavozxd> @elenamanetta oh the innocence
[0:36:56] <Mucmaster> I don't know what you're on about. Paint varnish smells awesome
[0:36:56] <rytisone> WASTED
[0:36:58] <%Hammerknife> in general, people who don't care about their own appearance or ability to appear or move in public, aren't going to care about other people's opinions on them
[0:36:59] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> she gone learn today
[0:37:00] <ChoculaUltra> so the BO isn't part of the mind game meta?
[0:37:00] <%lewdskeletor13> @elenamanetta You have no idea

[0:37:19] <DracaenaLeaf> A little
[0:37:19] <%ElenaManetta> No
[0:37:19] <1matheuw> no
[0:37:20] <%CJett92> Nah, s'good

[0:37:23] <%mh9s> i hear it yeah
[0:37:23] <$RubberFistFight> @SWindleFeD depends on what they're thinned with. Acrylics can be thinned with windex which barely smells at all, or you can use drying retarder and flow aid which also... don't smell at all. It's only things like enamels or lacquers that stink.
[0:37:23] <starotter70> nah
[0:37:24] <+johnny_gogo> Nope
[0:37:24] <%street_sign> ya little

[0:37:38] <+ArcLifth> I turned my shit up to like 200% and barely hear it

For example, in Wraith the Oblivion, there's not a lot to craft with in the spirit world, so they Soulforge other Wraiths into items and structures, mostly as punishment or euthanasia. No one knows if they're still sentient, but they do moan eternally, so that doesn't bode well for Mr. Haight the ashtray.

[1:02:24] <Kefkaisnotamused> Open the sarcophagus? Got it boss!
[1:02:24] <%ClutchRoadagain> Does he have anything invested in melee?
[1:02:25] <%spiritofmojave> RETURN THE SLAB
[1:02:26] <mojokingizakku> @joylent_blue that's kinda neat
[1:02:26] <%Kirby_Sauce> @Dio_TR I'm not even shitposting on this one. Eva fans more or less ruined the series for it's CREATOR.
[1:02:27] <+MoonObscure> LOL
[1:02:27] <Zombrocom> Don't open it
[1:02:28] <mayorrev> and i remember the dayyyyyy
[1:02:29] <talisign> Will Pat do this mission the super easy way, or the super hard way?
[1:02:32] <mayorrev> when you left for santa monica
[1:02:34] <derap41> Its a 451 game
[1:02:34] <mojokingizakku> also ah, deus ex in what ways?
[1:02:36] <%dukenux> Eh, a little bit of a a little bit of b
[1:02:36] <%Prevot> Deus SUCC
[1:02:38] <Bouldus> are there people looking throug hthose windows
[1:02:39] <%lewdskeletor13> DO WHATEVER YOU WANT
[1:02:39] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> ...based on this, I think I might like deus ex more than fallout
[1:02:40] <%Tucker0603> GUN
[1:02:41] <antthefool> OHHHHH
[1:02:42] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @AngriestPat dont forget to visit your Santa Monica home
[1:02:42] <%crimsonharvest> But the real answer is yes its fallout, Troika made it
[1:02:43] <%deviljhojho94> do it coward
[1:02:43] <lloyddboy> GUN
[1:02:43] <r_Foeburden87> TThat actually explains a lot
[1:02:43] <+w4rhe4rt_> thicc pumpa
[1:02:45] <%mh9s> you will pretty much NEED IT by the endgame
[1:02:45] <%VanaSkiller> GUN
[1:02:45] <+InstiGaitan> gun gun gun
[1:02:45] <KeystoneA1> Security, Brawl, Dodge are vital
[1:02:46] <%wvuboii> BIG GUN
[1:02:46] <%ClutchRoadagain> oh god oh fuck
[1:02:47] <%nekodelic> noooooooo
[1:02:47] <+JackMillerTime> dont rock the boat baby
[1:02:48] <a1u5> Gun gang
[1:02:48] <+thesilverhelix> good old sandra molacca
[1:02:48] <starotter70> Do Seduction coward
[1:02:49] <%wvuboii> GUN GO UP
[1:02:50] <PSI_Guy95> You need to either shoot good or melee good at some point
[1:02:50] <derap41> Is fallout a 451 game?
[1:02:51] <KeystoneA1> Everything else is at your discretion
[1:02:51] <%Niney_Who> Pump your pump action
[1:02:51] <%connos_livereview> GUN
[1:02:51] <+Solutha> Gotta get that .44 magnum
[1:02:53] <1matheuw> gun is the only true way
[1:02:53] <%dukenux> When Troika died, haven't some people move to Obsidian?
[1:02:53] <a_mad_dragon> nah boy MORE MAGIC
[1:02:54] <%ClutchRoadagain> melee, Pat, pls god melee
[1:02:55] <%nekodelic> GUN BAD IN THIS
[1:02:55] <%deviljhojho94> @AngriestPat Guns are Magikarp, Shit early, busted later
[1:02:56] <a1u5> Late game
[1:02:56] <%AbnormalVoid> only if they're pump action Kappa
[1:02:57] <+EdenOfLove> if you pump gun you get a lot less aim sway
[1:02:57] <+miguelrod777> GUN GUN GUN
[1:02:58] <derap41> I guess it would be
[1:02:58] <Danndy_Guy_in_Space> Pump up the GUN
[1:02:58] <+saltpiggu> @AngriestPat PUMP SEDUCTION
[1:02:58] <+armor_kuma> This game looks like if Deus Ex was about that weird Gun Kata Vampire Latex Matrix times of the 2000s
[1:02:58] <RupanSen> Meh
[1:02:59] <Zombrocom> Do whatever
[1:02:59] <Kefkaisnotamused> Pump charisma. That's all you need.
[1:03:00] <+w4rhe4rt_> guns are for nerds
[1:03:01] <%GarbageNirvana> Deus Ex is better than fallout, fact
[1:03:01] <%AncelDeLambert> firearms is possibly the most important stat of the game
[1:03:01] <$trias_e> gun magic and blood magic combo
[1:03:02] <alexandrecau> what are you a commie? Don't listen to the people pat
[1:03:03] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Firearms is only useful against one boss and that's very late.
[1:03:03] <%Dio_TR> @Kirby_Sauce i know i was just joshing didn't want to come as rude, sorry
[1:03:04] <TwinBat> Yeah
[1:03:07] <%deviljhojho94> not yet
[1:03:08] <KeystoneA1> Yes but not yet
[1:03:09] <Patzzki217> because you have thaumaturgy maxed out already might as well invest in other trees
[1:03:09] <count_bob> Later.
[1:03:10] <+thebonebard> honestly i think you should just get a bit of seduction to use club girls for blood ammo
[1:03:11] <%GarbageNirvana> Modern Fallout anyway
[1:03:11] <jijipose> Later
[1:03:12] <a1u5> Later
[1:03:12] <+JackMillerTime> why not have a gun and magic
[1:03:13] <NeoOneShin> @AngriestPat cause you have auspex and it's the maximum damage on weapons you can get, in guns
[1:03:13] <%deviljhojho94> Tremere get it later
[1:03:13] <%connos_livereview> GUN MAGE
[1:03:13] <talisign> No, you just get the one
[1:03:14] <Patzzki217> later
[1:03:14] <starotter70> You can eventually
[1:03:14] <%mh9s> you will get one later pat
[1:03:15] <+EdenOfLove> You get it after this quest
[1:03:15] <+NinjaWitaSniper> LATER
[1:03:15] <%spiritofmojave> This game really does have that early Eidos jank from 2001
[1:03:16] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Later
[1:03:17] <%Kirby_Sauce> @SGrim EVA fans ruined the series for it's creator and drove him to hate it.
[1:03:17] <Kefkaisnotamused> Guns are for sissies. Boiling their blood is for men.
[1:03:19] <%crimsonharvest> It's later dont worry abou tit
[1:03:20] <%manwithboxonhead> Guns later on will become good.
[1:03:20] <DracaenaLeaf> you get it eventually if you're nice to le croix
[1:03:20] <+Solutha> Help tremere guy
[1:03:20] <$valriot> Bloodtinge build
[1:03:20] <%dukenux> @Bustamente this game is super early 00s
[1:03:21] <%browengazebolo> You do get one.
[1:03:22] <%Bupkis7> Later
[1:03:23] <derap41> You've got your shitty apartment
[1:03:26] <BunnyEmperor> Later and its literally a hideout alright
[1:03:26] <randomp141> @AngriestPat You can but not till you get to Holly Wood or please Ladick
[1:03:26] <%Tucker0603> @angriestpat so you can dual wield magic and GUN
[1:03:26] <PSI_Guy95> At Strauss's Chantry you can get one. Nosferatu and Ventrue can get unique ones too
[1:03:27] <%deviljhojho94> hop in coward
[1:03:27] <%ClutchRoadagain> At least one dot or two, it'll really help

[1:03:29] <saint_george> you get one later
[1:03:31] <jijipose> Open it you coward

[1:03:36] <PSI_Guy95> don't open it tho
[1:03:37] <PhantaniumOG> To get it you have to do this quest a certain way

[1:04:14] <%stabbityrabbit> @AngriestPat Dude, you really don't need it yet. Guns are good late-game, but for most of the game Thaumaturgy is fucking broken. What you need is more utility skills. Stealth, speech, security, and such.
[1:04:14] <%puhff> WAOW
[1:04:14] <Kefkaisnotamused> Loooooooore!!

[1:04:54] <+drakthebest> People telling you to pump firearms are wrong as shit. Brawl or melee are a lot more important, ranged options in this game suck and your blood magic is already extremely powerful

[1:28:32] <KeystoneA1> @Zalthia Only after the first or *maybe* second time they drink Vampire blood. 3rd time is a permanent blood bond that makes them basically a slave to the vampire who's blood they drink.
[1:28:32] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> It sounds more like trying to convine YOURSELF.
[1:28:34] <%dukenux> CHUNKY BOI
[1:28:34] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Pat got a golden ticket to a free Yandere what a lucky turn of events

[1:32:18] <%stabbityrabbit> Okay, maybe I'm alone in this, but I actually like him more that Nines. LaCroix is horrible, but I find him infinitely more bearable than the other one. Despite me agreeing with the Anarchs more than the Camarilla.

[1:32:29] <RupanSen> "I now have the ability to block people on Twitter"
[1:32:30] <$CharlesRobinJr> joker is offical tomorrow
[1:32:31] <%manwithboxonhead> I would recommend you to invest those points elsewhere

[1:33:11] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> GUN GANG.
[1:33:11] <%wvuboii> GUN
[1:33:12] <@commanderclaw> Only humans
[1:33:13] <PSI_Guy95> maybe he can give you a new house
[1:33:16] <+thebonebard> BIG LOCKPICK
[1:33:16] <NeoOneShin> Pat you can't explode vampires
[1:33:16] <Bouldus> but magic
[1:33:17] <+Solutha> Cuz sometimes magic is not good
[1:33:17] <jijipose> Guns are the real magic
[1:33:18] <Dehlome> you can run out of blood
[1:33:18] <%Shikari21> Guns suck
[1:33:19] <PowerfulBlackGangs> He said, after putting points in Suicide
[1:33:20] <+thebonebard> BIG HACKING
[1:33:20] <%AncelDeLambert> Guns outstrip all other forms of damage by endgame
[1:33:22] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Scuicide has a cool down, autoshotguns are better
[1:33:23] <+Xalgar> @AngriestPat So did Harry Dresden
[1:33:24] <%skullnaught> THE GUN IS GOOD
[1:33:24] <%Kavtech> Sneak and talk are better than gun.
[1:33:24] <+drakthebest> Guns suck in this game stop telling him to get them!
[1:33:25] <AlasterAngelo> You don't need guns just buy blood packs
[1:33:28] <%Tucker0603> can't explode vamps
[1:33:28] <%skizzuto> I'm with pat on this one, magic is cooler than guns
[1:33:30] <+armor_kuma> GUN is the real explode
[1:33:32] <PSI_Guy95> Guns get really good by the end and you can use blood magic WITH guns
[1:33:32] <saint_george> Guns got OP at the last tier
[1:33:33] <Ion_Laser> Elmo SCREM
[1:33:34] <%manwithboxonhead> Guns only require ammo not blood.
[1:33:35] <%OldOnyx> The actually good guns aren't even available yet
[1:33:35] <+drakthebest> Half your enemies are vampires and vampires are almost completely immune to guns!
[1:33:38] <PowerfulBlackGangs> EMLO
[1:33:40] <%mh9s> apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib

[1:33:45] <universaldove> [ G U N ]
[1:33:45] <+Diabetic> I know they're unrelated but this game just reminds me of Blood Omen/ Soul Reaver
[1:33:46] <%cerazor01> You can hang off the guns for now.
[1:33:47] <Rotharn> yea, but rolling a d20 to see if your shot lands is way more exciting
[1:33:47] <Ner234> SHAKE BAG
[1:33:50] <NeoOneShin> guns don't suck, @drakthebest they're the best especially for auspex clans
[1:33:51] <starotter70> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[1:33:51] <ミュウレ4242> because gun is the strongest element.
[1:33:52] <%manwithboxonhead> And guns are far less conspicous then blood magic.

[1:34:43] <%ClutchRoadagain> You can run out of blood and there are parts of the game where if you aren't super stingy about using it, you WILL run out of blood so some parts you'll really, really want to treat as a secondary more than anything else.
[1:34:44] <OhioNitsud> emlo the caterade

[1:35:14] <rytisone> Pat and Paige: Origins
[1:35:16] <+drakthebest> Vamps are NOT going to be a problem. For any vamp boss, Pat can just spam blood boil, drink blood packs, and keep on spamming blood boil. He'll kill them all in very short order. Melee weapons+blood buff (which he should use more) is also very effective. Pat's only failure so far is that he isn't using trance+feed in the middle of combat to regen his wounds and regain blood
[1:35:16] <jijipose> She is way better if you are a malk LUL

[1:49:30] <derap41> Yeah that's the 451 curse
[1:49:33] <+Mittensbro> it IS one of the all time greatest games ever
[1:49:34] <+drakthebest> This is still one of the greatest all time games ever
[1:49:35] <+Promessa_EX> wouldn't expect male dominant vampire sex stuff
[1:49:36] <%averyoddjew> soooo joker's release date got announced
[1:49:38] <+Promessa_EX> in 2019
[1:49:38] <DingusMcBaseball> is still is tho
[1:49:38] <InugamiTheHound> so this was fallout 76 of its day? LOL
[1:49:39] <PSI_Guy95> I only got into this recently so I'm not super hype for the sequel
[1:49:42] <%skullnaught> im worried about the writing
[1:49:43] <%NWR_James> honestly, the buggy mes it was was part of the charm
[1:49:43] <KangarooCyborg> It's basically Mario 64
[1:49:43] <%SaltyDongs> We respect bad bitches in this chat
[1:49:44] <axelcezar> agreed, very impressive game
[1:49:44] <%dukenux> It is a "cult classic"
[1:49:46] <+bear_breaker20> I feel like morrowind it HAS to be jank for it to be good kinda
[1:49:50] <KnightofNights2> @mariomarc what he said
[1:49:53] <Ion_Laser> @InugamiTheHound cmonBruh
[1:49:55] <rytisone> came out the same day as Half Life 2. Developer closes studio shortly LUL
[1:49:59] <$Slimshazbot> @skullnaught same lead writer helps
[1:50:02] <%NWR_James> What do you know about Anakin Skywalker?
[1:50:03] <%spiritofmojave> Writing saves a lot of its bugs, kinda like NV
[1:50:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I always just heard it was bugged out to unplayable levels
[1:50:08] <Xelhesia> the fuck you call vamp pat
[1:50:10] <SomersaultJustice> let them drink the red liquid from the dark sarcophagus
[1:50:10] <+thebonebard> @InugamiTheHound no. becuase this is good all around except for the bugs
[1:50:11] <%dukenux> Tell me about sarcophagus juice
[1:50:12] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Ask him why he's a knock off morpheus doll.
[1:50:18] <+mariomarc> I'm gonna main Joker just to Style on fools
[1:50:21] <%stabbityrabbit> It's actually insane. All the sequel really has to do is make this game again, but not fall the fuck apart.
[1:50:24] <DSD24> "Winter is coming"
[1:50:24] <ShichiNoBushi> Is it Dracula?
[1:50:28] <%dukenux> like DIO
[1:50:28] <KnightofNights2> I nearly shit my pants watching the Joker trailer.
[1:50:34] <Sloavon> is dracula in this game?
[1:50:34] <+abadbadman> @AngriestPat please use the alleyway that cuts through the downtown map, also you can run against walls to run faster
[1:50:36] <Huntercd> Pillar Men
[1:50:37] <+bear_breaker20> the sequel includes coffin juice*
[1:50:41] <%dukenux> Worse than Dracula
[1:50:45] <lotharrio> Sono chi no sada me...
[1:50:55] <DSD24> Its still lame that Final Fantasy only has two songs
[1:50:55] <Conky89> I'm hoping the sequel of this game will be able to have more of what was originally envisioned for this one. Development problems prevented this game from reaching its full potential.
[1:50:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> SOON THO
[1:50:58] <rubbishbinge> joker Kirby is the worst
[1:50:58] <Kefkaisnotamused> It opened the box from inside and ate 50 people.. gee I wonder what it could pooooossssibly be.
[1:50:59] <%SergeEXE> Abuse the Diagonals
[1:50:59] <+Binary_Fireball> the walls are red
[1:50:59] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Vampire Magic
[1:51:00] <+abadbadman> because source engine @AngriestPat
[1:51:01] <%Gogogolem> Bug
[1:51:02] <TwinBat> source
[1:51:02] <lloyddboy> source engine
[1:51:02] <rytisone> WALLRUNNING
[1:51:02] <%Reizie_Etherealm> DIO [Over Heaven]
[1:51:04] <%SergeEXE> Source Engine
[1:51:04] <+dante_must_die_exe> That's old Half-life physics
[1:51:05] <lotharrio> Cause you load less stuff.
[1:51:05] <%starkandstag> ancient vampire secret
[1:51:06] <+Binary_Fireball> red=speed
[1:51:08] <SpaceGuntank> speedrun tactics
[1:51:08] <+asgard147> because shut up pat
[1:51:09] <Ultimatefool> If you alternate left and right (A and D) you go really fast
[1:51:09] <BoneofMalkav> Classic Doom / Quake movement phsyics
[1:51:10] <%Laecerelius> Engine jank, Pat
[1:51:10] <pimpinahz> cuz ...shut up
[1:51:11] <%CJett92> Because youre a vampire, dun. Cmon man, this is 101 stuff
[1:51:11] <%manwithboxonhead> He knows more than you probably think. But he is your dad and a Tremere, so you have to listen to him.
[1:51:12] <%crimsonharvest> it's a quirk of the way vector math works when calculating acceleration
[1:51:13] <+bear_breaker20> wall running starts LULU
[1:51:16] <Atheistpreacher> Man, in my head canon Dio shows up and dunks on these scrubs
[1:51:17] <Psyramics> you just said it was a buggy piece of shit
[1:51:25] <Kefkaisnotamused> WRYYY
[1:51:26] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @AngriestPat mashing A and D repeatedly makes you run faster for some reason
[1:51:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> apatPorgmo
[1:51:28] <+Promessa_EX> can you do abbhops
[1:51:29] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Writers are the same, so the sequel's writing probably will be still quality, and that's the strength of this game
[1:51:30] <PSI_Guy95> you can bunny hop too
[1:51:31] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@BrazenMask) (warning)
[1:51:33] <%Laecerelius> apatGib apatGib apatGib apatGib
[1:51:33] <%legendfather_of_giants> legendfather_of_giants subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! Man, Joker's stage is the fucking best.
[1:51:33] <%MightyMaxT> Dudes, I'm so pumped for Joker tomorrow
[1:51:34] <%gespenst25> this Childe
[1:51:37] <+EdenOfLove> I wondering if you can bhop in this
[1:51:38] <%dukenux> BTW: not familiar with this setting. Is Dracula real?
[1:51:40] <%idyota> is elmo pat's childe????
[1:51:40] <%lizard0tm> Can't wait for the return of Master DIO
[1:51:41] <%Gatzarlok> Less atmospheric pressure around walls, leaving less resistance for faster running.
[1:51:44] <%dukenux> in this world i mean
[1:51:48] <+barkon345> I heard in the Sequal you are going to start as a Catif and then pick your clan as a sort of prestige class. that dose not give me much hope for the sequal
[1:51:48] <randomp141> @AngriestPat You're gonna want some ammo.
[1:51:51] <%SergeEXE> Ye
[1:51:54] <+Binary_Fireball> no
[1:51:55] <+Binary_Fireball> dont
[1:51:55] <Dr_Mooose> of course
[1:51:56] <KnightofNights2> The Persona stage is going to have music from 3,4, and 5
[1:51:56] <%spiritofmojave> Ye
[1:51:58] <+ArcLifth> ye
[1:51:58] <%SolidusRex> Fun fact, did you know female player characters in this game run SLIGHTLY faster then male player characters?
[1:51:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> smash?
[1:52:00] <%lizard0tm> Can you bunnyhop in this game like other source games?
[1:52:00] <%thackattack00> no
[1:52:00] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Yes
[1:52:01] <Twoiis> eh
[1:52:01] <Kefkaisnotamused> Dracula is real in this universe, actually. But he's nobody important.
[1:52:02] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> pretty much
[1:52:04] <Sloavon> so is DIO a combination of all the races except for noseferatu?
[1:52:04] <HopelesSoul7> no
[1:52:05] <SunsetJack> It's tomorrow the release date soo...?
[1:52:07] <lotharrio> Smash and Chaos Legion double feature!
[1:52:07] <helpmeimafruit> Smash Melee? Kappa
[1:52:08] <KnightofNights2> FUCK YEAH
[1:52:08] <+abadbadman> nah
[1:52:09] <starotter70> Cool
[1:52:10] <%Remery_> We can smash Pat again? :D
[1:52:11] <r_Foeburden87> not an entire smash stream but maybe a classic mode run or two
[1:52:11] <%ShaneWhite> Yup
[1:52:12] <InugamiTheHound> but I thought smash wasn't a fighting game?
[1:52:13] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I don't even have a switch and even if I did I could care less about smash or it's dlc characters
[1:52:14] <$Slimshazbot> pretty sure Dracula is fake in this world
[1:52:17] <%Tucker0603> don't have to, though do it if ya want to
[1:52:17] <+walnutcast> eat it all
[1:52:18] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @dukenux Hell yeah he is, and he's a Tzimince
[1:52:19] <TheHotStuven> JOKER FOR SMASH POG
[1:52:20] <NocturnalRites> If the sequel lets me be a Lasombra
[1:52:21] <randomp141> @AngriestPat You want more shotgun ammo
[1:52:22] <+abadbadman> also fuck yeah I got into the stream at my favourite part of the game
[1:52:23] <PlatinumWyvern> joker looks busted btw
[1:52:24] <DSD24> You don't need ammo for your FISTS
[1:52:26] <NocturnalRites> I will be very happy
[1:52:27] <%ShaneWhite> 100% to Smash
[1:52:27] <+Binary_Fireball> only if you fight woolz to the death
[1:52:28] <PSI_Guy95> Dracula in this universe is a chad who tricked an idiot into turning him, then got a ton of power and forced a writer to write a book about him
[1:52:28] <%SaltyDongs> yup
[1:52:29] <+Solutha> eh grouts is EZ with magic
[1:52:30] <tinypouf> nah
[1:52:30] <riven_hexe> No, Vlad's real in WoD.
[1:52:31] <derap41> Vlad was a vampire in this world
[1:52:32] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Yes
[1:52:32] <%ClutchRoadagain> melee and blood magic helps, too.
[1:52:32] <+abadbadman> nope
[1:52:32] <AlasterAngelo> @Slimshazbot Dracula's real he just doesn't care
[1:52:33] <CrimsonFox777> You can never have enough ammo.
[1:52:34] <@commanderclaw> Depends on how hard you go
[1:52:35] <%RadicalPirate> @Slimshazbot Dracula is real; He's a Tzmetzie
[1:52:35] <+EdenOfLove> BEST GAME
[1:52:35] <DracaenaLeaf> you need a whole 41 ammos
[1:52:36] <Kefkaisnotamused> Drac is a fairly decent leveled Tzimisce. But he isn't special.
[1:52:36] <%mh9s> not really but more cant hurt
[1:52:36] <+StooEsq> Just in case
[1:52:37] <starotter70> You're good
[1:52:37] <+thebonebard> its fiiiiiine
[1:52:39] <PowerfulBlackGangs> LARRY
[1:52:40] <%spiritofmojave> I wouldn't worry about it
[1:52:41] <%gespenst25> Your fangs don't need ammo...
[1:52:45] <DSD24> @PlatinumWyvern You can't say that until you play him
[1:52:46] <Dr_Mooose> mah man
[1:52:47] <Ion_Laser> Yo Yo YO
[1:52:49] <KnightofNights2> has he seen the trailer?
[1:52:50] <$trias_e> you have all the money, why not
[1:52:51] <%dukenux> KOALA EARS
[1:52:51] <%JayEarly> DIO is a Ventrue because he has the power of CHARISMA
[1:52:52] <$vincerocmm> shadbaseBigsmoke
[1:52:53] <%PlainSimpleTailor> YO YO YO
[1:52:53] <PSI_Guy95> @gespenst25 but they do need flossing and brushing
[1:52:53] <ShichiNoBushi> Buy some dinosaur eggs.
[1:52:54] <+EdenOfLove> you need an uzi
[1:52:57] <+EdenOfLove> buy the uzi
[1:52:57] <starotter70> Dinosaur Eggs
[1:52:58] <derap41> Dracula himself wasn't real tho
[1:53:00] <+Binary_Fireball> do you guys think Larry gets a ton of ass?
[1:53:00] <Ion_Laser> DinoSAWR EGGS
[1:53:01] <axelcezar> maaah men
[1:53:01] <randomp141> @AngriestPat You can also sell the 38, it's useless.
[1:53:01] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Gotta buy to keep your ammo up CJ!
[1:53:02] <+barkon345> @Slimshazbot Dracula did Exist in the world of darkness
[1:53:02] <pimpinahz> YES!!! The Tzimence creation will be a bitch to deal with Pat. Moore ammo

[1:53:05] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Gallapagos Turtle when?
[1:53:09] <ooblag> You will literally never get rid of that purse
[1:53:11] <%ECRead> you still got that Galapagos turtle, Larry?
[1:53:12] <+Binary_Fireball> because I think larry is swimming in a mountain of sex
[1:53:14] <+EdenOfLove> UZI gun tho
[1:53:16] <BlindGato> So when do we fight Dracula?
[1:53:19] <%JayEarly> @binary_fireball is that even a question?
[1:53:20] <+thebonebard> god i hope there is a blacula in 2
[1:53:21] <%ClutchRoadagain> Maybe the newest unofficial patch just made it more viable than it was prior, but ye melee works super well in the newest patch.
[1:53:22] <Kefkaisnotamused> Dio would be 100 percent Ventrue.
[1:53:24] <Yung__Ken> Has Pat met Andrei yet?
[1:53:28] <+abadbadman> @AngriestPat you can drop all that shit you cant sell or buffs you in a draw at your apartment
[1:53:29] <+EdenOfLove> buy biggg uzi
[1:53:31] <%dukenux> No i know Dracula wasn't real LUL atleast not the guy Stocker portrayed. Thanks everyone for responses, tho!
[1:53:31] <derap41> This is America Pat
[1:53:33] <AlasterAngelo> Dio would be a Tzimice
[1:53:34] <$jobbedbone> You're gonna carry that purse

[1:53:37] <PlatinumWyvern> @dsd24 that why I said "looks" and not "is"
[1:53:37] <lotharrio> It's America.
[1:53:38] <@commanderclaw> Until the cops see you, yeah
[1:53:39] <$Slimshazbot> @binary_fireball he apparently bangs big tidied club goth
[1:53:40] <Zalthia> Dio would become his own clan
[1:53:40] <$PaleBloodInk> It's America, Pat.
[1:53:40] <+Binary_Fireball> @JayEarly It's the question that I love asking
[1:53:42] <DracaenaLeaf> No not really but yeah. it freaks people out but that's all I know
[1:53:44] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Good, you'll want to use it in his house, do NOT try and melee with your skill
[1:53:45] <a1u5> This is America
[1:53:45] <%Iccirrus> Big Freedom

[1:53:53] <+EdenOfLove> open carry
[1:53:54] <+abadbadman> :>
[1:53:55] <RupanSen> Dio is a True Brujah
[1:53:56] <Atheistpreacher> DIo would be 100% above all this clan shit
[1:54:00] <OwlLightningMage> A casual walking shotgun
[1:54:01] <+Binary_Fireball> is...LARRY A BIG TIDDY GOTH GIRLFRIEND?
[1:54:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> DIO is a True Brujah, or at least diablerized one to get Temporis.
[1:54:05] <DSD24> @PlatinumWyvern Ah my mistake I disagree that he looks broken but sorry if I was rude
[1:54:10] <rytisone> what a mansion

[2:14:57] <natebud> Yeah it'd be cool if you could murder this guy
[2:14:57] <Kefkaisnotamused> See, he's just been a Malk for a few years at this recording. The higher you get the older and crazier he goes.

[2:15:33] <Sapphire_Breeze> they don't
[2:15:34] <communistjk> he runs it, his madness presents itself not in an outward way
[2:15:35] <%manwithboxonhead> They don’t
[2:15:36] <Parapattern> Good thing I drink plenty of "Malk"?
[2:15:38] <+drakthebest> You can feed off of vampires pat
[2:15:38] <BoneofMalkav> They don't.
[2:15:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> With the luck of insight
[2:15:40] <%spiritofmojave> Well, you're right- they don't
[2:15:40] <+Afrobrawler> not all of them are that crazy
[2:15:41] <DracaenaLeaf> They're psychos in an insane asylum
[2:15:41] <%Bupkis7> Use auspex
[2:15:41] <KeystoneA1> Some of them aren't so insane they can't function in society
[2:15:42] <+drakthebest> But also yes they are people
[2:15:42] <danknugglit> S u c c e d
[2:15:43] <+thebonebard> malks arent actually as crazy as you think
[2:15:44] <%umbypokochan> umbypokochan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Hot take: Patreon exclusive videos are just Youtube DLC.
[2:15:45] <Radski5> It's almost like an intrinsic trait of Malkavians is Insanity.
[2:15:45] <%dukenux> Ghouls. Religious ghouls i tell ya!
[2:15:45] <+dante_must_die_exe> just cuz they crazy dont mean they aint people
[2:15:45] <+KoyaMusa> they're never stable clan

[2:15:48] <natebud> Ghoul halfway house
[2:15:49] <RupanSen> yes
[2:15:49] <randomp141> @AngriestPat They're insane! From EARTH!.
[2:15:49] <Jolly_Adventurer> its free real estate
[2:15:50] <ミュウレ4242> they can see the future. like that planet of fishmen in dbz:a.
[2:15:50] <DSD24> Its free real estate
[2:15:51] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> remember, killing the insane is not a moral evil
[2:15:51] <PSI_Guy95> they're crazy so you can eat them
[2:15:51] <Kefkaisnotamused> Malkavians have something called the "Madness Network" It's kind of a psychic crazy Borg Collective type thing that keeps them.. relatively in sync.
[2:15:52] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @AngriestPat Malkavians can speak to one another via telekinesis, and in fact thats what causes their madness
[2:15:52] <%TheBigO75> They have...ALOT of thralls
[2:15:52] <+Solutha> The have insight
[2:15:55] <Badgerconda_> Malkavian Madness Network.
[2:15:56] <%idyota> a lot of malkavians have mental illnesses that are less psycho
[2:15:56] <ooblag> Their Grandpappy Vampire is in their minds, fucking with them all the time
[2:15:59] <%mh9s> yeah their clan founder still exists...inside their heads. all of their heads
[2:15:59] <ShichiNoBushi> Vampires can feed on vampires, but then they have to deal with blood bonding.
[2:15:59] <HopelesSoul7> @AngriestPat its actually called the madness network
[2:16:00] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Alternatively, casual diablerie! A win-win situation
[2:16:00] <+KoyaMusa> yes the hivemind is called the madness network
[2:16:01] <BoneofMalkav> Oh yeah, The Malkavian Madness Network
[2:16:01] <Badgerconda_> They're cool as heck.
[2:16:03] <Mr_Strut> It's more like they see things the same way
[2:16:05] <a1u5> Teressa, go so crazy you go sane
[2:16:05] <%manwithboxonhead> The Malkav Net
[2:16:06] <+Binary_Fireball> Dennis Rodman is the leader of the Malks
[2:16:06] <PerrinIsDead> Sounds like the same theremin from Mars Attacks
[2:16:06] <natebud> The madness everywhere systme
[2:16:07] <+TONYOO101> They tend to have a hivemind of madness, giving them a ton of insight, however their collective voices makes then a bit loony
[2:16:08] <DSD24> @Jolly_Adventurer We said it at the same time! High Five!
[2:16:09] <KaseKaizer> Malkavians are basically the internet
[2:16:10] <llamington> Its free Meal estate
[2:16:11] <silver__viii> Malk differs but they can be unbelievably perceptive, everyone just thinks they're idiots
[2:16:11] <%Dio_TR> Malkavians are WOKE
[2:16:12] <%Quentinmr> well
[2:16:14] <DagetStreams> Malk cloud saves
[2:16:18] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat The theory is that their hivemind *is* their Antediluvian Malkav who transcended reality

[2:16:21] <worldbrand> I like the muffled laughter, that's a good touch
[2:16:22] <%Quentinmr> that's one way to deal with that sort of thing
[2:16:23] <Jolly_Adventurer> @DSD24 Hell yeah dude!
[2:16:24] <randomp141> @AngriestPat She was just having a giggle fit.
[2:16:25] <derap41> nomnomnom
[2:16:27] <pimpinahz> they dont. lol they had the powers to transfer their insanity to another user and when they realized that was too OP, their hives minds decided to forget that ability
[2:16:28] <+thebonebard> the player character malk is WAY more crazy than a lot of other malks from what ive heard
[2:16:28] <RipHina> why are they all facing the corner??
[2:16:31] <%manwithboxonhead> Dialberizing them is a bad idea.
[2:16:34] <+Estuko> Wha0 WHAT?
[2:16:35] <%Laecerelius> Still laughing after getting her neck snapped. sounds about right
[2:16:36] <NeoOneShin> Malkavians are also one of the largest clans, because they embrace constantly
[2:16:37] <%Quentinmr> have you tried being less murder happy?
[2:16:40] <Kefkaisnotamused> When they talk all crazy its just them hiding what they know behind a mask of randomness.
[2:16:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> Madness Network is fucking rad.
[2:16:42] <KeystoneA1> Sort of yes
[2:16:44] <a1u5> @RipHina They saw the blair witch

[2:16:46] <pimpinahz> yup
[2:16:56] <KnightofNights2> am i the only one getting Bioshock vibes from this?

[2:17:01] <PSI_Guy95> Being John Malkavian
[2:17:01] <DSD24> Snapping necks like you are Steven Segal
[2:17:03] <$jobbedbone> whats over there, is that the script?
[2:17:03] <Sloavon> @rytisone fuck
[2:17:04] <+abadbadman> kinda, depends on the VtM edition you read
[2:17:07] <Badgerconda_> Malkav lives in the network. He's like a decentralized being-- bits of himself live in every malk in existence. At least, I think that's the coolest theory.
[2:17:11] <%spiritofmojave> Is it ever explained why other vampire species can succ Malk blood and not go crazy in game here
[2:17:11] <+NinjaWitaSniper> Pat is a Malk IRL because he crazy talks too
[2:17:11] <%dukenux> @KnightofNights2 cause of the voice messages?
[2:17:12] <prophetdisharmonious> Pain was a malk confirmed
[2:17:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> Try the arm stealth kill
[2:17:13] <+thebonebard> god i would love for og bioware to make a vtm game]
[2:17:14] <Kefkaisnotamused> Being John Malkavian.. lmao
[2:17:15] <%gespenst25> @angriestpat there's a theory that all Malkavians are part of a hive mind controlled by Malkav their founder. that would also mean that Malkav is the only antideluvian still active in the world. which is a worrying possibility
[2:17:20] <Radski5> Malkavians essentially have an intrinsic network where they all communicate unconsciously with their Antidiluvian.
[2:17:22] <ayskoh> why would you build a house like this
[2:17:23] <%CJett92> WHAT a MANSION

[2:19:25] <DSD24> I love the word Dogma
[2:19:25] <Kefkaisnotamused> Just like how with Tzimisce, Viscissitude is also controlled by their antedeluvian and in their version of the end he turns all vampires with the power into horrible Thing like flesh monsters and makes the world really, really, really awful.
[2:19:26] <%Laecerelius> Werepyres!

[2:23:05] <count_bob> 3
[2:23:05] <+KoyaMusa> well tremere is different, cause he killed a gen 3
[2:23:06] <PSI_Guy95> Antideluvian means "before the flood", the original vamps are super old
[2:23:07] <%shotgang86> gen 3
[2:23:08] <NeoOneShin> @AngriestPat Tremere is not an original
[2:23:11] <%Quentinmr> gods among gods
[2:23:12] <+thebonebard> arent tremere artificial
[2:23:12] <+abadbadman> yes
[2:23:12] <BigCoffee> yes
[2:23:12] <$spacehouse> Yes'
[2:23:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> Tremere stole their powers
[2:23:16] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> 2nd is totally wiped out by Cain.
[2:23:16] <PSI_Guy95> Generation 3
[2:23:17] <+bear_breaker20> OH that kinda shit
[2:23:17] <Midnight188> Tremem stole their power from Saulot and the Salubri
[2:23:17] <Kefkaisnotamused> Ventrue would be the original.. Tzimisce would be original... it's kind of a pattern.
[2:23:17] <Badgerconda_> Antediluvians are third generation. They're the original of each clan's line.
[2:23:17] <NocturnalRites> The Tremere did some heinous shit to become vampires
[2:23:18] <GothicLoveBlood> Tremere is a special case
[2:23:20] <+zeegaming> Malkav isn’t their name they just call it that cause they don’t know
[2:23:20] <%mr_macho_muchacho> Gen 3 had most of the bugs worked out
[2:23:20] <+Zerodyne90> maybe
[2:23:21] <InugamiTheHound> wait Noah's flood was real in this game?
[2:23:21] <Jeemukun> pat's good at this
[2:23:24] <NeoOneShin> Also Tremere is dead
[2:23:25] <%Kirby_Sauce> Good 'ol OP Dracule
[2:23:27] <%gespenst25> Yeah. gen 3 they ate all of Cain's children I believe
[2:23:27] <Hazlet95> that looks so bad
[2:23:29] <Badgerconda_> tremere are BIG FRAUDS. perfect for pat.
[2:23:29] <%manwithboxonhead> Tremere dialberized
[2:23:31] <%0dokuro> Tremere were wizards that wanted immortality
[2:23:32] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Tremere used to be mages
[2:23:33] <pimpinahz> CAIN is also around in the game, hehehe
[2:23:33] <NeoOneShin> The guy he ate actualyl ate him. Backfire diablerie
[2:23:35] <Conky89> Tremere are not trusted for their cheating they did.
[2:23:38] <%Laecerelius> They cheated so they're perfect for you, Pat!
[2:23:38] <Kefkaisnotamused> Tremere tried to cheat, now he has an evil creep pretending to be him.
[2:23:39] <%stabbityrabbit> Gen 3, but they diablerized gen 2. So they're actually gen 2 now.
[2:23:40] <@commanderclaw> Caine is unbeatable
[2:23:40] <TwinBat> maybe
[2:23:40] <PSI_Guy95> @InugamiTheHound God and Caine from the bible are literally real, of course it happened
[2:23:42] <%0dokuro> Basically
[2:23:42] <+abadbadman> @AngriestPat Tremere killed the Good Vamp Antidiluvian to become a clan of their own, they're basically the scum bags
[2:23:43] <%mr_macho_muchacho> Cain is too cool for school
[2:23:44] <+subdude_> Cain is basically God.
[2:23:46] <ooblag> Caine is literally unstoppable. He is one step below God
[2:23:46] <+Zerodyne90> kinda
[2:23:46] <count_bob> Yup.
[2:23:47] <Badgerconda_> Caine is basically a god.
[2:23:47] <%BrazenMask> jesus cain and abel are all real in this universe
[2:23:47] <helpmeimafruit> he would try to kill YHVH
[2:23:48] <GothicLoveBlood> @InugamiTheHound yeah it has relgion mixed into this game
[2:23:48] <%snow_bush> @InugamiTheHound Yes. God is VERY real here too
[2:23:48] <%spiritofmojave> He'd be fucking broken basically
[2:23:48] <BigCoffee> yes
[2:23:48] <Mr_Strut> The devil is a little different
[2:23:49] <fearhurst> deep seeded belief
[2:23:49] <+asgard147> yup
[2:23:50] <DarkOmen98> 1st gen is Caine and it's only him... 2nd gen is his 3 childer, they in turn made the 3rd gen the anti-deluvians
[2:23:50] <Kefkaisnotamused> Caine is actually really, really chill.
[2:23:50] <dragoon001914> Cain can just make up new vampire powers as he pleases.
[2:23:51] <%mercado94> i guess
[2:23:51] <%Quentinmr> he'd skillfuck existence
[2:23:51] <KeystoneA1> Yes
[2:23:51] <+KoyaMusa> caine knows all disciplines of vampirism
[2:23:52] <derap41> Cain would be the god on earth
[2:23:52] <prophetdisharmonious> Caine op
[2:23:53] <HeadsHeldHigh> Cain isn't really a bad dude
[2:23:53] <+thebonebard> fucking shh about cain chat
[2:23:53] <%Niney_Who> Cain is just Unstoppable
[2:23:53] <%manwithboxonhead> Yes
[2:23:56] <%Quentinmr> skullfuck
[2:23:56] <takokasa> Caine is actually unkillable until he says he's sorry. God will not let him die or be harmed
[2:23:56] <%rdark_ksu> i mean he was number 1
[2:23:57] <rytisone> KIDS LOVE THE DEVIL
[2:23:57] <BigCoffee> Cain is 100% unstoppable in canon
[2:23:58] <%mr_macho_muchacho> Aint got time for your problems, mammal
[2:23:59] <%Dio_TR> Cain is big DADDY
[2:23:59] <%0dokuro> Cain is super chill though
[2:24:00] <+Tokanova> caine is around he's just chill and doing nothing
[2:24:00] <%snow_bush> Cain is OG vampire
[2:24:00] <Nolat885> Caines stats in game are 'YOU LOSE'
[2:24:00] <Badgerconda_> the rules for fighting Caine in the tabletop are literally just 'you lose'
[2:24:01] <PSI_Guy95> Caine's godlike, he's just immortable until he apologizes to Abel
[2:24:01] <+drakthebest> Tremere devoured Salubri, leader of the salubri clan. Tremere proceeded to tarnish the salubri name and make the clan into outcasts in order to legitimize themselves
[2:24:01] <SchroedingersFerret> If he WERE to show up.
[2:24:02] <%mh9s> caine had the ability to just flat out CANCEL any disciplines used in his vicinity
[2:24:02] <%Quentinmr> he'd skullfuck existence
[2:24:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Cain is the strongest a vampire can ever be. No other vampire could ever best him, even if they worked together. He's strong enough to match higher supernatural beings like the Fey.
[2:24:03] <reiju_22> spoilers holy shit
[2:24:04] <a1u5> Cain is OP, his children are OP, and the further down the line you are the more diluted your blood
[2:24:04] <NeoOneShin> I love how Tremere actuallygets Possessed by Saulot. Saulot was evil all along.
[2:24:04] <Atheistpreacher> Caine made some vampire and got sick of this political shit so he left
[2:24:06] <Mr_Strut> Demons are also a thing, and then there's the unclean one
[2:24:06] <$jobbedbone> Caine is Doofy from Scary Movie
[2:24:07] <+Binary_Fireball> Spoiler it's all spiral power
[2:24:07] <Radski5> Tremere are not only horrific flesh monsters but are also frauds and cheaters.
[2:24:09] <mesamus> @randomp141 fuck you

[2:25:10] <+drakthebest> The curse God put on caine was so strong that Caine was able to harness its power for vampiric magic, so he is effectively using godly powers
[2:25:10] <ミュウレ4242> in the tabletop game, there was an event where the antedeluvian Ravnos woke up. even that was nuts.
[2:25:10] <Yung__Ken> Isn’t Caine just chilling in a cave during this time?

[2:27:06] <PerrinIsDead> Did you remember the locker
[2:27:06] <Mr_Strut> Never trust count chocula
[2:27:06] <%Kavtech> I never frenzied once in this game.
[2:27:07] <NeoOneShin> Who's the best Antediluvian? My money is on Saulot: 3 eyes, soul powers, GOLCONDA!
[2:27:08] <%IDTheftVictim> That stairway hurts my head
[2:27:10] <%Laecerelius> BIG SPOOKS!
[2:27:11] <DarkOmen98> and in the modern era the newly made vampires are of the 15th - 18th gen... the 19th are the thin bloods unable to make more vampires as they are to far removed from caine
[2:27:16] <pimpinahz> lol
[2:27:17] <%0dokuro> Kra mansion is kra
[2:27:23] <a1u5> Recorder
[2:27:28] <Kefkaisnotamused> Best ante? Tzimisce.
[2:27:30] <%Laecerelius> Time for some more sneakies!
[2:27:33] <DracaenaLeaf> that noise
[2:27:33] <$jobbedbone> I'd let myself be metoo'd for vampire powers
[2:27:37] <NeoOneShin> @DarkOmen98 dude, thin bloods are gen 13-15
[2:27:39] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> apatBig suck
[2:27:42] <%IDTheftVictim> What's this guy's name again? Alistair?
[2:27:43] <%Laecerelius> Use the axe, please!
[2:27:44] <+barkon345> @DarkOmen98 1th 12th and 13th
[2:27:47] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Ca BAN-no
[2:27:47] <prophetdisharmonious> Pat drains his victims of redbull
[2:27:47] <@commanderclaw> @mesamus Thanks for the heads up, banhammered
[2:27:48] <Ion_Laser> Big SUCC
[2:27:49] <KeystoneA1> Tzimisce is basically a living Grey Goo scenario
[2:27:51] <InugamiTheHound> can vampires drink another blood of vampire and gain more powers?
[2:27:53] <PSI_Guy95> wow that's an awful noise
[2:27:55] <ooblag> 13 is your average PC. 8th is Elder
[2:27:56] <mesamus> thank you
[2:27:57] <%Laecerelius> Slap these guys into the next dimension!
[2:27:59] <dayspring815> Did you feed on Donald Duck?
[2:28:00] <%Jetsfantasy> If you made them kill themselves, did you succ a corpse?
[2:28:05] <%Shadowevilkoala> I think its half of all 14 gen are thinbloods and all of 15 gen are thinbloods
[2:28:07] <%0dokuro> Thin bloods are the watered down coke from Mcdonalds
[2:28:08] <Atheistpreacher> I bet vampire gerrymandering is really shitty
[2:28:11] <PSI_Guy95> snippety snap :DDDD
[2:28:13] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @commanderclaw not before I spoiled myself :(
[2:28:15] <PerrinIsDead> Vampire Government is a dumb phrase
[2:28:16] <SomersaultJustice> pat has more viewers than dsp
[2:28:17] <NocturnalRites> @InugamiTheHound yes
[2:28:18] <Yung__Ken> Remember that time during Gehenna when the Tremare Antedeluvian tried to stop Tzimisce and it backfired and all of humanity became part of the Tzimisce Antedeluvian?
[2:28:19] <%RiffRaff1138> @InugamiTheHound Yes, if the one being fed on is an older generation. It's called diablerie
[2:28:19] <%IDTheftVictim> Vampire eating vampire is looked down upon
[2:28:23] <NeoOneShin> @InugamiTheHound Yeah, they drink their soul, but it can backfire and they can get thier soul eaten instead
[2:28:23] <GothicLoveBlood> @InugamiTheHound yes but there is taboo this game goes into it about it
[2:28:25] <ミュウレ4242> statwise, your character in this game should be 8th gen, i think.
[2:28:28] <%rasterman> Whats the stealth kill like with the arm?
[2:28:30] <Kefkaisnotamused> You know, Gangrel melded and BECAME the planet, so.....
[2:28:32] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @InugamiTheHound Yeah, it's called Diablerie. There's some big consequences though
[2:28:33] <GundamF91> The neck snap sound is horrible, its too real
[2:28:34] <pimpinahz> KEY
[2:28:36] <%manwithboxonhead> @inugamithehound You are thinking of Dialberizing. Yes anot not only drink their blood, but also their soul as well.
[2:28:40] <DracaenaLeaf> kill everyone but leave the room haha
[2:28:40] <%mr_macho_muchacho> @InugamiTheHound yes its called Diablerie and it is forbidden in the camarilla
[2:28:41] <HeadsHeldHigh> Which antediluvian got space lasered by mages?
[2:28:49] <%AncelDeLambert> @IDTheftVictim well, it's blatantly obvious when you do it, so there's that
[2:28:51] <%gespenst25> I think PCs are usually gen13. thinbloods can be gen13s but they're just crap ones.
[2:28:53] <BoneofMalkav> "My name is Count Patula, and I have an addiction to snapping necks."
[2:28:54] <+barkon345> @DarkOmen98 there are no vampires that have reached 15th 16th 17th gen yet the blood would be too thin
[2:28:56] <Yung__Ken> @headsheldhigh ravnos
[2:28:58] <NocturnalRites> How taboo diablierie is depends on the clan
[2:28:59] <ミュウレ4242> HeadsHeldHigh, ravnos. the technocracy rules, btw.
[2:28:59] <Kefkaisnotamused> Ravnos got space lasered.
[2:29:00] <$jobbedbone> are you guys making up words to make this intractable or what
[2:29:01] <majima666> well, we have azombie government in the uk. so vampire isnt that farfetched
[2:29:05] <%rdark_ksu> i could listen to this dude all day
[2:29:09] <pimpinahz> Get the key
[2:29:12] <Kefkaisnotamused> And kind of ruined the Wraith and Mage games.

[2:29:19] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, the guy recording the audio files is really good
[2:29:20] <%dukenux> What's that smell?
[2:29:21] <Croetec> Juice!
[2:29:21] <Kefkaisnotamused> Or made them better depending on your perspective.
[2:29:21] <+Tokanova> basically malkavians know a lot about whats going on in vampire world but keep it to themselves

[2:31:05] <$jobbedbone> morphine works on vampires?
[2:31:07] <%0dokuro> Cursed blood
[2:31:08] <InugamiTheHound> gourmet is a ghoul from tokyo ghoul
[2:31:10] <%MelBrooksKA> @lilmac64 ye
[2:31:14] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat This guy seems really nefarious even by vampire standards. Hes like dracula and dr.frankenstein had a baby.
[2:31:16] <NocturnalRites> Did Pat miss the book in the room with the first candle puzzle?
[2:31:19] <pimpinahz> Experiments lol
[2:31:20] <lilmac64> Cool. Can't wait to see him use it accidentally.
[2:31:25] <Kefkaisnotamused> Morphine probably wouldnt work on a vampire. Put morphine in a mortal and drink their blood would.
[2:31:29] <%mr_macho_muchacho> morphine doesnt work on gingers
[2:31:30] <majima666> isnt that just tomato juice?
[2:31:32] <%mr_macho_muchacho> Are gingers vampires?
[2:31:33] <Conky89> The more you know
[2:31:34] <danknugglit> Morphine and saws. This seems like a fun room
[2:31:35] <%Laecerelius> Dr. Draculastein?! We don't talk about him around here!
[2:31:38] <majima666> vegan blood
[2:31:38] <%mr_macho_muchacho> gingers=vampires confirmed
[2:31:41] <%manwithboxonhead> The Elder Vitae is the Kobe Beef of Blood.
[2:31:42] <%dukenux> Dr. Acula
[2:31:42] <%korth367> spooky
[2:31:43] <Badgerconda_> And then you eat the people who took the morphine and you get the morphine.
[2:31:44] <DracaenaLeaf> what
[2:31:45] <a1u5> In essence, what if a malakavian, a clan known for it's insight, has someone not completely insane?
[2:31:46] <%0dokuro> L O R E
[2:31:48] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Dr. Frankencard
[2:31:50] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> uhhhhh
[2:31:50] <KeystoneA1> It makes your shit hard though
[2:31:51] <pimpinahz> Pat Lore

[2:32:02] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> paige. Are you ok
[2:32:06] <prophetdisharmonious> can confirm. Morphine is only extra flavoring at that point
[2:32:11] <$nademonkey1100> pat addicted to morphine confirmed
[2:32:13] <%Laecerelius> Yum
[2:32:14] <%gespenst25> @headsheldhigh it's a crime to drain all the blood from another vampire. it's called Diablarie and it's the only (?) way to lower your generation - to diablarize a lower gen vampire. it's such a temptation that they punish it by murdering the perp with extreme prejudice
[2:32:17] <GothicLoveBlood> @a1u5 they start going crazy as well
[2:32:17] <Kefkaisnotamused> @a1u5 Actually, being a Malkavian you only have to take "A" derangement, and it can be one of like 30 things. Ttal batshit insanity is more of a meme.
[2:32:18] <Dr_Mooose> everybody chill
[2:32:20] <%mercado94> shill forever
[2:32:21] <%0dokuro> Laughing like crazy while you drink their blood is super unsettling
[2:32:23] <NeoOneShin> @a1u5 Most of them are completely normal on the surface, it's just his game representing an overacted stereotype
[2:32:24] <TwinBat> the chillest
[2:32:25] <%mercado94> chil*
[2:32:28] <$jobbedbone> Have an ICE DAY
[2:32:30] <takokasa> [chill intensifies]

[2:32:32] <%ECRead> I'm cool as ice
[2:32:33] <DSD24> Take a break everyone
[2:32:33] <+bubblebasspickles> its all good in the hood :)
[2:32:35] <%Laecerelius> Use your axe to send them to the Shadow Realm!
[2:32:36] <%Das_Bass> is it bad he's draining them of all their blood???
[2:32:39] <pimpinahz> yes, put the meat bags in the fridge to chill the lunch
[2:32:40] <mesamus> malkavians are so frantic they also get clsoe to drain your blood if i remember correctly
[2:32:41] <%manwithboxonhead> Chill the fuck out
[2:32:42] <%ShaneWhite> Chill people excuse me
[2:32:44] <+abadbadman> go back
[2:32:44] <Ion_Laser> it's totally normal in here
[2:32:45] <%0dokuro> Easter Egg ahead
[2:32:47] <frozenottsel> they need some of the good green
[2:32:47] <%dukenux> Seizure Room
[2:32:47] <omen_setter> chill as cucumbers
[2:32:47] <NocturnalRites> Unless you are an Asamaite then diablerie is the shit
[2:32:48] <+abadbadman> shortcut behind you

[2:32:49] <CrypticMochi> They need a nap
[2:32:50] <DSD24> Its like Incredibles 2
[2:32:50] <derap41> We're gonna be like the Fonz and what's the fonz like?
[2:32:51] <ALazo> Cure for the giggles
[2:32:53] <danknugglit> That room sucks
[2:32:54] <a1u5> One more door
[2:32:54] <+countgaculatv> Man look at all this insanity lol
[2:32:57] <%0dokuro> Will Pat find the Easter Egg
[2:33:02] <DracaenaLeaf> not really
[2:33:02] <prophetdisharmonious> Arkham Asylum looks better than usual
[2:33:05] <DracaenaLeaf> @making sure
[2:33:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Diablerie, draining the blood of another vampire, is only illegal in the Camarilla. The Camarilla are not the Vampire Police and they don't control nearly as many vampires as they pretend they do.
[2:33:07] <Kefkaisnotamused> The Malkavian in the first game, VtM Redemption talked like a total wacko, so now most people tend to think of ALL Malkavians that way.
[2:33:10] <NocturnalRites> And I think the few remaining Salubri do it too
[2:33:11] <%Laecerelius> Get your yum-yums!
[2:33:12] <%Eclipse_knight_> vampires are gross
[2:33:13] <DracaenaLeaf> who is this making i tagged oops
[2:33:16] <%manwithboxonhead> That sound
[2:33:17] <%ShaneWhite> Excuse Me
[2:33:31] <%Laecerelius> BLUUUDBUFF!
[2:33:41] <+KoyaMusa> so aside from vampires there's equally deep lore on werewolves, wraiths, and ghosts and they ALL interact, basically spooky warhammer 40k
[2:33:42] <%gespenst25> Google Fish Malk for a good time.
[2:33:46] <pimpinahz> what is it???? is bluuud
[2:33:49] <Ion_Laser> gotta love that BludBuuff
[2:33:49] <+abadbadman> think he'll find it chat?

[2:35:54] <ithirstforfreddurst> !uptime
[2:35:54] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 35m.
[2:35:57] <%spiritofmojave> They couldn't record one more unique cry track, just looped that shit
[2:35:58] <rosemon5001> killing the crazy thots
[2:36:01] <DrkJP520> Psycho behaviour from pat
[2:36:02] <alexandrecau> stop crying bitch
[2:36:03] <DracaenaLeaf> the windows have no in-game need
[2:36:09] <%manwithboxonhead> ITS the MALKAVAIAN Mansion. Natural laws need not apply, also gtfo Physics.
[2:36:10] <pimpinahz> Pat's a Peeping tom
[2:36:11] <+dark_willow> @dark_willow is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[2:36:12] <omen_setter> that neck popping sound is extreme
[2:36:12] <prophetdisharmonious> Pat gave her something to cry about
[2:36:13] <SparkAfterDark> oh cool the david cage section
[2:36:16] <Yeajow> Real exciting secret LUL
[2:36:16] <%Stratiotai2> get reht
[2:36:17] <%mercado94> ouchie ouch
[2:36:19] <Kefkaisnotamused> You can be a Malkavian and your mental health problem could be Megalomania. Or narcissism. Not truly in your face crazy.
[2:36:21] <GothicLoveBlood> LUL
[2:36:22] <Dr_Mooose> what's up *punch*
[2:36:22] <danknugglit> LUL
[2:36:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer500 If Caine was thrown into the sun, he wouldn't die, though the sun very well might. And during the Week of Nightmares, Zapathasura, the Ravnos Antediluvian, wakes up and goes on a rampage. He's basically a World Boss. Three of the oldest enlightened Kuei-Jin masters were fighting him, and then the Technocracy used orbital mirror sun lasers and a spirit nuke that erased a chunk of the spirit world and created a dead zone.
[2:36:38] <NocturnalRites> Those damn gimps and their aggravated damage
[2:36:42] <+countgaculatv> Imma tell you now that the rooms have no loot
[2:36:54] <DrkJP520> Za waarudo
[2:36:54] <mesamus> watch out for their grab attacks
[2:36:56] <Atheistpreacher> Just drank another vampire
[2:37:01] <%Stratiotai2> what do you think zombie blood tastes like?
[2:37:01] <Ion_Laser> What's that smell?
[2:37:05] <DracaenaLeaf> EVillll
[2:37:10] <majima666> "5 today....or is it 6?"
[2:37:13] <%0dokuro> Rat Sucker
[2:37:17] <InugamiTheHound> kill him with a shotgun
[2:37:20] <Kefkaisnotamused> @GeneralSCPatton And after all that it is extremely possible Ravnos is still alive.
[2:37:21] <$jobbedbone> @Stratiotai2 chicken
[2:37:22] <%0dokuro> Nope
[2:37:23] <ooblag> You will
[2:37:25] <DracaenaLeaf> Right? the gun wasn't needed
[2:37:25] <%manwithboxonhead> @stratiotai2 Yuck because their blood is not fresh.
[2:37:27] <NeoOneShin> YOU NEED A GUN
[2:37:28] <Bouldus> guns are for the weak
[2:37:29] <@commanderclaw> Fucking wizards
[2:37:31] <+StrawberryPantsu> You need a gun
[2:37:33] <Ultimatefool> Tremere = My MIND is my GUN
[2:37:37] <lloyddboy> a gun called SAVESCUM
[2:37:37] <%0dokuro> Guns later on are good, no really now
[2:37:38] <+abadbadman> GUN WIZARD
[2:37:38] <+thebonebard> you need a lockpick and hacking
[2:37:38] <+countgaculatv> Just wait tell you fight fuckers you can't drink from
[2:37:41] <%Shadowevilkoala> you're a wizard pat
[2:37:42] <ScreamingMeat> Mind Gun
[2:37:44] <%Laecerelius> You have BLOOD GUN!
[2:37:44] <takiyami> Pat, of all people, saying he doesn't need a gun
[2:37:45] <%AncelDeLambert> can't wait until he hits the sewers
[2:37:46] <Croetec> Man I hope he gets screwed by that later LUL
[2:37:46] <Kefkaisnotamused> Ravnos had the power... of perfect illusion. Sooo... the ycould have been fighting thin air and never would have known.
[2:37:49] <%spiritofmojave> @GeneralSCPatton Technocracy and orbital space-lasers really do remind me of Warhammer, this is otherworldly silliness LUL
[2:37:50] <%Stratiotai2> so like drinking month old milk?
[2:37:50] <%ShaneWhite> Crazy Talk!!!!
[2:37:50] <NocturnalRites> pff if you went Gangrel you can just melee everything to death
[2:37:51] <+Anonymasque> I NEED A FUN. Oh wait. That's why I'm here!
[2:37:52] <ooblag> I very much promise, YOU WILL NEED GUN
[2:37:53] <BoneofMalkav> first person platforming LUL
[2:37:53] <%AncelDeLambert> sewers are going to WRECK him
[2:37:54] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Blood bending is supposedly the strongest avatar power
[2:37:54] <SparkAfterDark> who needs gun when can wizard?
[2:37:56] <%goatofdeparture666> full reign to use sick blood magic and guns and a fire axe... but sure trance and bite is cool too
[2:37:56] <pimpinahz> Put you duck juice on the corpses, Pat
[2:37:57] <danknugglit> Who needs confidence when you have a gun
[2:37:58] <CrimsonFox777> Even if you don't need a gun, you NEED a gun. I will die on this hill.
[2:38:01] <$Slimshazbot> never used a gun in this game and had ZERO trouble at any point
[2:38:04] <Badgerconda_> You do need guns... especially near the end of the game when you get access to the super OP stuff like the spaz.
[2:38:05] <%Laecerelius> Hardcore parkour!
[2:38:06] <+EdenOfLove> its cause the guns are really good if you level them, and ar fun, but if you have fun with mind puzzles be our guest
[2:38:07] <prophetdisharmonious> i'm starting to remember how great the platforming was in this game
[2:38:17] <ScreamingMeat> The best kind of platforming
[2:38:22] <%FancyHatMan> what's up tiny buttercups apatLiz
[2:38:22] <%0dokuro> Best platforming
[2:38:29] <+bubblebasspickles> 4Head just chill brah
[2:38:30] <%spooky_cyborg> This reminds me of half life platforming
[2:38:31] <Kefkaisnotamused> You would literally need Mage magic at like.. nearly Caine-like levels to truly see through Ravnos's illusions if he really, really put his mind to it.
[2:38:35] <$jobbedbone> why don't the women go ragdoll, but you can find the same corpses placed environmentally
[2:38:35] <Ion_Laser> he's good brah
[2:38:39] <PSI_Guy95> man you're eating everyon here
[2:38:41] <NocturnalRites> The fact the force you to play Camarilla only in this is sad the Sabbat clans have some cool powers
[2:38:41] <ooblag> They are salient
[2:38:42] <%MonsieurHedge> rogers internet went down for over an hour, rip stream for me
[2:38:44] <%Tredecian> @AngriestPat joker comes out tommorrow in smash
[2:38:47] <%0dokuro> His slow decent into madness
[2:38:49] <+maxismywaifu> sbfpPat
[2:38:52] <DSD24> I hear voices in my head
[2:38:53] <Kefkaisnotamused> Thats why Antes are end game stuff.
[2:38:56] <Sloavon> these guys have more potent blood than prostitutes
[2:39:01] <%Stratiotai2> vampires mist have crazy blood filtering capabilities to filter out that zombo mutation either that or the mutation does mot effect a vampire in the same way... 🤔🤔
[2:39:08] <Ion_Laser> they counsel me...they understand
[2:39:08] <rytisone> all these voices inside of my head...
[2:39:08] <alexandrecau> they talk to me they understand
[2:39:15] <%0dokuro> This voice acting is pretty good
[2:39:16] <Kefkaisnotamused> Here we go, full blown Malkavian.
[2:39:19] <+Lazyjoules> oh THIS game
[2:39:23] <%starkandstag> muda muda muda

[2:39:28] <natebud> let me guess who sent you down here to ice this guy...
[2:39:28] <mesamus> if pat does a new game i really want him to pick malkavian for all the really great dialogue
[2:39:32] <ooblag> Do you remember that fortune teller on the Beach? She was a Malk. The voices actually have things to say, including agendas
[2:39:32] <GothicLoveBlood> Yeah now the malk curse is getting stronger in him
[2:39:33] <prophetdisharmonious> Is he talking about Pat?
[2:39:33] <pimpinahz> Bakayaro
[2:39:34] <%IncredibleMeh> big cray cray
[2:39:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> INSIGHT GAINED
[2:39:42] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Youwereeatenbyalid)
[2:39:45] <$trias_e> This game has the best voice acting in general except for the occasional disaster
[2:39:48] <Kefkaisnotamused> The first few tapes was him at like.. ten years as a vamp. Now we're at like 80 years later.
[2:39:48] <%manwithboxonhead> @generalscpatton Also the spirit caused the Sixth Malestrom that caused the underworld to cease to exist causing the Wraiths to possess corpses. And the Fallen as well from Hell escaping due to the weakening barriers. So yea dat Spirit Nuke.
[2:39:48] <+Lazyjoules> chat, he's on like hour 3, right?

[2:39:59] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 40m.
[2:40:01] <%mr_macho_muchacho> Ya know how a goup of crows is called a "murder" and a group of lions is called a "pride"
[2:40:13] <%mr_macho_muchacho> I think a group of homeless should be called a "soup kitchen"
[2:40:19] <%0dokuro> Slow crazy
[2:40:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Fun fact: Grout is going through the actual stages of paranoia that are taught in psychology. At this point, he's at the final and most dangerous stage, isolation/seclusion.
[2:40:20] <DSD24> @mr_macho_muchacho A group of tigers is a Ambush!
[2:40:24] <+Lazyjoules> fuck yes I was SPOT ON
[2:40:34] <%Stratiotai2> @mr_macho_muchacho apatBig oooof

[2:40:44] <ミュウレ4242> tigers are solitary hunters.
[2:40:44] <zamzoph> SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED

[2:44:44] <+BurkeBigsby> guns are trash until like, last 20% of the game.
[2:44:45] <%ElectronDemise> gun always win
[2:44:46] <%manwithboxonhead> SHOOT the Fire to put it out
[2:44:49] <DracaenaLeaf> that shotgun sucks because it reloads slow
[2:44:50] <ShichiNoBushi> Vampires can catch you if you are on fire.

[2:48:40] <Atheistpreacher> Remember when pat was hesitant at first
[2:48:40] <%Nobrev> pat theres a cooldown on these things you cant just have infinite money and blood
[2:48:41] <prophetdisharmonious> What has Pat done to discount Paige?
[2:48:44] <%snow_bush> Just stick elder vampire blood in her!
[2:48:44] <+Noxybaru> Toxic relationship gang
[2:48:47] <+thebonebard> i didnt know you could open this desk
[2:48:52] <Radski5> Pat talking about how egregious Grout is while keeping a ghoul slave.
[2:48:54] <Kefkaisnotamused> Photo is importante!
[2:48:55] <rosemon5001> maybe she is for the sex
[2:48:58] <%BrazenMask> So nines sure was acting funny huh?
[2:49:01] <%SaltyDongs> He's like this with Paige too
[2:49:02] <Ominnous> Pat: wtf you keep your wife in a tube?
[2:49:03] <%lewdskeletor13> This Ghoul thing is super fucked
[2:49:06] <SparkAfterDark> This is why paige doesn't stream with him lately
[2:49:08] <+thebonebard> i dont think vampire men can do sex
[2:49:08] <%FrustratedAF> curaze taku
[2:49:11] <pimpinahz> PAT. KEEP GHE THURMATURGY BOOK lol
[2:49:14] <Ominnous> also Pat: stupid wife, give me all your blood
[2:49:14] <energywarning> put the arm in the fridge like a real serial killer
[2:49:15] <natebud> So I missed the boat, anything else happen between then and the mansion?
[2:49:16] <SparkAfterDark> he is eating her lupus
[2:49:16] <Croetec> radio pat
[2:49:21] <Viperwing999> pat the mailbox
[2:49:22] <InugamiTheHound> why have glock pistol but no ammo for it?
[2:49:24] <a1u5> Mailbox
[2:49:25] <NocturnalRites> Vampires totally bang, heck you can bone Jeanette
[2:49:32] <PSI_Guy95> did pat check the emails
[2:49:34] <ミュウレ4242> vampires can only have sex if they take special blood bending arts. jenette is one such vampire.
[2:49:34] <%shotgang86> pat check your emails
[2:49:39] <DonatelloJose> He won’t even make it dance for her though
[2:49:39] <GothicLoveBlood> They can but there is no point to it
[2:49:41] <prophetdisharmonious> always bone crazy. It never goes wrong
[2:49:43] <SchroedingersFerret> 3
[2:49:44] <DracaenaLeaf> he did check them recently
[2:49:47] <+thebonebard> i think jeanette could be boned but i dont know if you can bone her
[2:49:47] <ScreamingMeat> NOTHING
[2:49:50] <%joylent_blue> pat ThE LOcKER!
[2:49:51] <pimpinahz> you'll need the book in hollywood
[2:49:51] <+Binary_Fireball> is she wearing heels?
[2:49:54] <%Stratiotai2> according to twilight all vampires want is to fuck
[2:49:57] <Radski5> Your skin...change it.
[2:49:59] <KeystoneA1> Vampitrd can only bone if they expend blood points to raise their body temperature and raise...other things that need blood to raise
[2:49:59] <%TheMorilo> TheMorilo subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[2:50:12] <%lewdskeletor13> Fucking Greg
[2:50:15] <+thebonebard> so boning requires even more effort
[2:50:15] <GlootsforSloots> is this Countdown Vampires
[2:50:18] <Kefkaisnotamused> Vampires can "do it" but drinking blood gives a high several times more powerful and addictive, so its not that important in and of itself anymore.
[2:50:37] <%TheMorilo> 8 months of this beautiful shitshow
[2:50:39] <InugamiTheHound> no its vampire rain! @GlootsforSloots
[2:50:40] <a1u5> He takes suckerpunches as payment
[2:50:42] <reiju_22> LUL
[2:50:44] <Kefkaisnotamused> Plus vampires are all sterile so the instinct to bone nearly vanishes.
[2:50:45] <+Estuko> Customer Service
[2:50:45] <%0dokuro> @AngriestPat Any plan on doing a Makavinan run through to see how different it is?
[2:50:45] <Ion_Laser> LUL
[2:50:46] <Vvvzzzlllvvvzzzlllvvv> @ミュウレ4242 What? Any Path of Humanity vampire can spend blood to fuck
[2:50:48] <+BigBruthaThunda> real life lol
[2:50:52] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> hu
[2:50:53] <%shotgang86> making my way downtown
[2:50:54] <ooblag> Vampires also rarely bang because succing someone for blood is vastly more pleasurable than their numbed grinding
[2:50:55] <%lewdskeletor13> Drinking blood makes the penis the big penis
[2:51:00] <ShichiNoBushi> Also they need to spend vitae for the "blush of life" so they can get it up.
[2:51:09] <%brakkathoom> Cost one blood point to maintain an erection and there is little, if any, pleasure in it anymore. Downsides of being undead.

[2:51:30] <@commanderclaw> Crazy in a jar
[2:51:30] <KeystoneA1> Malk specific Domination line
[2:51:30] <GothicLoveBlood> Madness basically
[2:51:32] <+drakthebest> Dementation is a unique malkavian discipline. You drive people insane
[2:51:32] <a1u5> Invisibility, domination, and turn others insane
[2:51:32] <NocturnalRites> Basically you spread your insanity to others
[2:51:33] <+BoomerTiro> Their 3 disciplines are schizophrenia, paranoia, and halucination
[2:51:33] <Conky89> Good stuff. They are arguably the best class in the game to play.
[2:51:35] <ooblag> Yeah, sorry, Dementation. The Insane version of Domination
[2:51:37] <+TONYOO101> makes people crazy and you can use it during dialog @AngriestPat
[2:51:39] <DSD24> What about Nines!
[2:51:39] <%spiritofmojave> Crazy AOE
[2:51:41] <%brakkathoom> makes people crazy, mind fuck version of dominate

[2:53:05] <PSI_Guy95> Camarilla don't believei n that shit
[2:53:06] <Kefkaisnotamused> Not all vampires believe i nCaine. I think the Camarilla pretends there is no Caine.
[2:53:07] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat The Camarilla doesn't believe in Cain, despite the fact that vampires are real
[2:53:08] <+thebonebard> camerilla doesnt believe in cain officially
[2:53:09] <+zeegaming> That Camarilla say Caine isn’t real
[2:53:11] <%0dokuro> L O R E

[2:53:29] <derap41> VtM is more lovecraftien
[2:53:29] <Kefkaisnotamused> The camarilla actively sends people out to destroy all evidence of Caines existence.
[2:53:29] <%starkandstag> dos
[2:53:30] <%manwithboxonhead> Nope
[2:53:34] <+thebonebard> cammerilla is atheist on paper
[2:53:35] <+Scarlet_Crow> The Camarilla don't believe in Caine and *antediluvians.

[2:53:38] <frozenottsel> Where ever Nines is 2B is close : D
[2:53:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> How can God be real if Caine isn't real?
[2:53:40] <@commanderclaw> yep
[2:53:46] <Jolly_Adventurer> Are we going to have a race war!? PogChamp
[2:53:47] <+subdude_> They consider it superstition.
[2:53:48] <Radski5> Yes.
[2:53:48] <KeystoneA1> I know right?
[2:53:49] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat magic don't mean god
[2:53:49] <ooblag> Out of sight, out of mind philosophy
[2:53:50] <+PenmanLupine> Its like a religious myth
[2:53:51] <ShichiNoBushi> There are other origin myths such as Longinus.
[2:53:51] <%mh9s> humans are real, does that mean god exists?
[2:53:53] <+asgard147> yep
[2:53:54] <%rdark_ksu> thats fuckin dumb
[2:53:54] <+Lazyjoules> what doesn't make sense about that Kappa
[2:53:55] <%snow_bush> That's because the Camarila are stupid
[2:53:55] <GothicLoveBlood> They don't believe that's how it started
[2:53:57] <Badgerconda_> There's no real evidence that vampires came from Caine. that's all just creation myth.
[2:53:58] <RupanSen> yeah but it's mostly legends
[2:53:59] <%spiritofmojave> Cammies are fucking dumbs
[2:54:00] <+KoyaMusa> they don't believe """"on paper"""
[2:54:00] <%MattDemers> RIP haven
[2:54:00] <%dukenux> Yeah, but Caine is kinda legendary badass i guess
[2:54:00] <%CaptainTubaki> pat cant handle it lol
[2:54:00] <Kefkaisnotamused> Camarilla says that no one knows where vampires came from.
[2:54:01] <+Scarlet_Crow> The Camerilla don't believe in Cain and actively cover it up. It is like a conspiracy.
[2:54:01] <%BrazenMask> thats all ancient stuff
[2:54:01] <%manwithboxonhead> It is more of a myth
[2:54:01] <DracaenaLeaf> nobody believes in Cain as far as you are in the story
[2:54:02] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> alright. ok. here we go.
[2:54:02] <ミュウレ4242> lots of weird stuff is real. doesn't mean the first explanation is sthe right one.
[2:54:03] <%Niney_Who> Pat does Human existing mean God exist?
[2:54:03] <%Laecerelius> Yeah, magic and shit is real but God? PFFT.
[2:54:04] <ooblag> Caine being real mean GEHENNA is real, and that's bad
[2:54:04] <a1u5> Sabat = Believe/ Camirilla = Nah, we're just superhuman/ Anarchs = Fuck you all
[2:54:05] <+abadbadman> Pat is Sabbat confirmed
[2:54:06] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> "Protection"
[2:54:07] <+Scarlet_Crow> Cain is a myth even to vampires.
[2:54:07] <+zeegaming> Camarilla basically say anything stronger than them is fake
[2:54:08] <+thebonebard> they dont "officially" believe in cain
[2:54:09] <+Scarlet_Crow> World full of actual magic btw. Pat is right it is dumb.
[2:54:09] <PSI_Guy95> Just because humans are real does that mean god is real.
[2:54:09] <%lewdskeletor13> GOD IS HEAD CANON
[2:54:09] <Badgerconda_> Caine and the antediluvians are like vampire Adam and Eve. Most consider it a myth.
[2:54:11] <%solomonpun> The Elder cams believe, they are just cowards that don't wanna face reality.
[2:54:12] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat humans are real do you believe in Adam?
[2:54:15] <%matrixManipulator> Multiple Creation Myths @AngriestPat
[2:54:17] <+Promessa_EX> if god is real, you really don't want to be undead, he'll fuck up your soul
[2:54:18] <+BoomerTiro> Camarilla have detailed records of Atlantis and nothing before that and have a non biblical explanation for vampiric origins.
[2:54:19] <PSI_Guy95> Hell if you believe Jesus existed does that mean God was a real person
[2:54:20] <+Scarlet_Crow> The Camarilla don't believe in Caine or Antediluvians and therefore god. They believe there are other supernatural explanations for the origins of vampires.
[2:54:20] <+Scarlet_Crow> Think about it in context, Pat.
[2:54:20] <+Scarlet_Crow> I know this is a past broadcast, but damn.
[2:54:20] <Radski5> Time does wierd stuff to history and memory, even for immortal vampires.
[2:54:24] <+EdenOfLove> pat go back to the last round
[2:54:29] <+Trtickster> Camarilla don't believe in Caine or Antedeluvians because they're related to a prophecy the Camarilla don't want to get down with
[2:54:30] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> hey! DON'T GO ROBBING THE AMNH! I PAY FOR THAT MEMBERSHIP FOR A REASON!
[2:54:34] <%brakkathoom> Camrilla don't "believe" in Caine and Republicans don't "believe" in climate change. They do believe but acknowledging it messes with day to day business
[2:54:37] <%skizzuto> sure just carry a giant fucking sarcophagus on your back
[2:54:42] <ミュウレ4242> werewolves also have their own explanation for vampires.
[2:54:42] <natebud> We're talking about creationist theories here thousands of years old. It's still wrong, but i get it.
[2:54:45] <+Lazyjoules> vineGreed
[2:54:50] <%razorknight> GIVE ME THE MONEY

[2:55:01] <%0dokuro> @ The vast majority of Kindred in the Camarilla are no older than a century or two and thus were not alive during the time when the Antediluvians were active powers in the world. So they dont really believe anything
[2:55:01] <Kefkaisnotamused> What brakkathoom said.

[2:55:17] <%lizard0tm> Literally all 3 are nah, don't need it
[2:55:18] <Atheistpreacher> Caine is basically a religious figure like vampire jesus
[2:55:18] <%lizard0tm> lame
[2:55:18] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> why no key?
[2:55:19] <+Mittensbro> no keys
[2:55:20] <%spiritofmojave> wait what
[2:55:20] <GothicLoveBlood> That's 2004 money
[2:55:22] <%salty_syd913> what
[2:55:23] <Cranky_Construct> that's dumb
[2:55:24] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> that's weird.
[2:55:25] <$nademonkey1100> i mean i can barely remember last week i dont think forgetting 200 years + ago is out of the question
[2:55:26] <ooblag> There are parts where this game had less money than they wanted
[2:55:26] <DracaenaLeaf> Right?
[2:55:27] <GothicLoveBlood> add inflation
[2:55:28] <tinypouf> the power of CHOICE
[2:55:29] <%SolidusRex> They changed that in the Plus Patch
[2:55:29] <+TONYOO101> I think its cause he's tremere
[2:55:30] <Ion_Laser> that's some BS
[2:55:30] <finalgrinder> the front door is unfinished but added in a Plus Patch
[2:55:34] <SchroedingersFerret> CHOICES
[2:55:35] <%Verd_254> I went through the front
[2:55:36] <+abadbadman> 1
[2:55:36] <Badgerconda_> That's just a weird thing the patch added to explain the way you automatically enter the museum through the roof.
[2:55:39] <pimpinahz> old game lll
[2:55:39] <%Niney_Who> Front door is literally unfinished
[2:55:40] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> ohhh they ran out of money
[2:55:40] <flubber3d> CUT CONTENT
[2:55:42] <Kefkaisnotamused> We as players know the history, but none of the in character folks have a clue.
[2:55:44] <%Verd_254> plus patch i guess
[2:55:45] <%manwithboxonhead> Try refusing the quest now
[2:55:45] <%0dokuro> Front door is unfinished in the game
[2:55:46] <Yeajow> You dont want those keys pat cmon
[2:55:46] <%AncelDeLambert> front doors have cameras
[2:55:47] <a1u5> Go to last round first
[2:55:53] <%0dokuro> oh no
[2:55:54] <+Scarlet_Crow> Which is still dumb though.
[2:55:54] <kingra> LUL
[2:55:54] <ミュウレ4242> the plus patch is probably the bast version of the game right now.

[3:13:09] <Kefkaisnotamused> Elmo believes the world is flat, I bet. Crazy kitty.
[3:13:10] <%0dokuro> It just reveals auras
[3:13:10] <PSI_Guy95> SO MANY FAKE DOORS
[3:13:10] <Radski5> What a mansion.
[3:13:12] <Sloavon> is Pat a real llife Maavian?
[3:13:18] <KeystoneA1> The real doors are behind the Rex
[3:13:20] <%lewdskeletor13> Elmo is a proponent of phrenology
[3:13:21] <%yoshkosh20> those doors were specifically put in to confuse vampires
[3:13:28] <Conky89> They are painted doors just for show
[3:13:29] <inz0mbiac> you just had to rob this place during the fake door exibit
[3:13:30] <%BonewheelVanguard> This shit is just a mix of Preacher and Hellblazer
[3:13:36] <danknugglit> Its a fake door museum LUL Jebaited
[3:13:37] <ithirstforfreddurst> real doors have modeled handles
[3:13:38] <Badgerconda_> The museum is BIG UNFINISHED.
[3:13:39] <%Reaviar> the real fake door business is booming
[3:13:39] <%wvuboii> Who turns a museum into a police station
[3:13:40] <GothicLoveBlood> But then you'll get lost easier LUL
[3:13:40] <%0dokuro> White Doors, look for them
[3:13:40] <%SvenHolgersson> Use your Vampire Door powers Pat
[3:13:40] <+CaptainJax> they're display pieces in the museum
[3:13:41] <%AlvinTheLiar> You need the Daimond key Pat
[3:13:41] <Ultimatefool> 2004, doors were hard to make
[3:13:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> doors lead to big things
[3:13:42] <ScreamingMeat> Pat would be a Malkavian IRL
[3:13:44] <%brakkathoom> money envelop on the t rex head!
[3:13:47] <%Laecerelius> The fake doors are there to confuse infiltrators
[3:13:48] <PSI_Guy95> i think the real doors have modelled knobs
[3:13:48] <talisign> Shits locked
[3:13:48] <%lewdskeletor13> Real fake doors

[3:27:48] <Viperwing999> Beckett looks like low-rent Yahtzee Crowshaw
[3:27:49] <+miguelrod777> what's a antediluivian
[3:27:52] <InugamiTheHound> gehenna? as in hell? Blue exorcist?
[3:27:54] <%mercado94> that sounds cool
[3:27:57] <Atheistpreacher> Bekett needs a fedora
[3:27:58] <RupanSen> Metal Gear?
[3:27:59] <+Lazyjoules> Pillar man Style?
[3:28:00] <%dukenux> before-the-flood
[3:28:03] <%Cthulos> Cringe was a thing before people memed the shit out of it. Chill
[3:28:05] <Sloavon> you know, I don't even give a shit about apocalypses anyore
[3:28:09] <%yoshkosh20> @miguelrod777 vampire placenta
[3:28:12] <%0dokuro> Whos to say
[3:28:14] <%konekoryugamine> So what you're saying is . . . we need to stop Dio.
[3:28:16] <DSD24> @triangularblasphemy Oh I agree they couldn't just not put nothing down but I don't think what ever they say would be believed
[3:28:18] <ScreamingMeat> Cain HATES the Antediluvians tho.
[3:28:20] <NocturnalRites> Also behind those glasses Beckett has cat eyes
[3:28:22] <talisign> @Lazyjoules The strongest vamps are basically pillar mens
[3:28:24] <Atzros> The Withering is way spookier than the antediluvians tbh
[3:28:25] <+thebonebard> god i love his eyes
[3:28:32] <ooblag> "Co-Existed"
[3:28:34] <%konekoryugamine> I can't stop looking at his eyes
[3:28:35] <Kefkaisnotamused> Never met a komodo dragon either, but..
[3:28:39] <DSD24> Enoch is awesome
[3:28:43] <%AncelDeLambert> I love this guy
[3:28:48] <%dukenux> Cain was a farmer, wasn't he
[3:28:48] <%AlvinTheLiar> Vampirism is just nano machines
[3:28:52] <%0dokuro> Watered down Coke
[3:28:54] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @ooblag "indentured servitude"
[3:28:55] <%konekoryugamine> EMLO
[3:28:56] <%AncelDeLambert> @dukenux yes
[3:29:00] <%Quentinmr> we still love you pat
[3:29:03] <%AncelDeLambert> Abel was the herder
[3:29:04] <DracaenaLeaf> so that's why you brute forced the stealth mission?
[3:29:06] <Kefkaisnotamused> Cain was a farmer.
[3:29:07] <ooblag> @dukenux Yeah, that even helped him in governing the city
[3:29:08] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @AngriestPat velociraptor got you on edge huh?"
[3:29:09] <VritraReiRei> Is this Kaz's VA?
[3:29:25] <%konekoryugamine> Oh wow
[3:29:25] <%rdark_ksu> i love that weird myth shit from early Christianity
[3:29:30] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat how many redbulls had you have?
[3:29:34] <GothicLoveBlood> @VritraReiRei the sarcophagus belongs to the nords!!
[3:29:35] <+AXL808> Now THAT'S a vampire!
[3:29:36] <FeverPitch17> Troy Baker?
[3:29:37] <+Scarlet_Crow> I'm glad he explains this.
[3:29:37] <DracaenaLeaf> this is the guy who voiced the skyrim chaarcters
[3:29:37] <mojokingizakku> imagine this cutscene but the cops come in and start shooting both vampires
[3:29:37] <Dreziv> joining in for the first time and I have no idea what this dude's talking about but hey whatever
[3:29:39] <%AncelDeLambert> Jewish people were herders, so it may have been a useful story of "naw we're better than those smelly farmers"
[3:29:45] <dsauce999> If it's not Kaz's VA, it is definitely Kaz with the Vampire nanomachines
[3:29:48] <%konekoryugamine> This is actually really good.
[3:29:50] <%mercado94> LIES
[3:29:51] <+BoomerTiro> Cats are mini predators and they love to cuddle with psychotic apes
[3:29:56] <jay521> What Clan is that guy?
[3:29:58] <benhart18> Edgy atheist Beckett DESTROYS GEHENNA WITH LOGIC AND REASON
[3:29:59] <%rdark_ksu> I also love when Japan looks at biblical shit and is like "i wonder what I can do with this"
[3:30:02] <%konekoryugamine> Thin-bloods?
[3:30:07] <talisign> @Dreziv Vampire's are worried their vampire god will come back and kill them all. That's basically it.
[3:30:07] <KeystoneA1> @jay521 Beckett is Gangrel
[3:30:08] <ithirstforfreddurst> wait a minute, Doom Eternal is out soon monkaS
[3:30:08] <+thebonebard> hes a gangrel
[3:30:14] <DracaenaLeaf> Michael Gough was the voice
[3:30:16] <jay521> Thanks Lad
[3:30:18] <jijipose> Mix Red Bull into coffee and never sleep again
[3:30:18] <ooblag> Gehenna is why the Thin Bloods get shit on so much
[3:30:19] <%konekoryugamine> What's a gangrel?

[3:30:32] <mesamus> i appreciate archeological vampires
[3:30:32] <ScreamingMeat> @konekoryugamine Very weak Vampires, barely more than mortal
[3:30:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> GeneralSCPatton subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! A low generation, or just being old and powerful, makes you need more potent blood to gain any sustenance. Animals stop working, and then humans stop working. Elders thirst for other vamps.
[3:30:35] <KeystoneA1> Gangrel is a bloodline
[3:30:40] <%konekoryugamine> @ScreamingMeat Thank you
[3:30:45] <GothicLoveBlood> @konekoryugamine a vampire clan bloodline
[3:30:45] <mrjohncarlton> Don't worry, if an Antediluvian wakes up the World of Darkness version of Hogwarts will use its satellite cannons.

[3:31:45] <DSD24> I love Becket so much
[3:31:45] <+zeegaming> He’s 300 years old so he’s one of those empirical weirdos
[3:31:47] <derap41> Lovecraft is the origin
[3:31:47] <%TheBigO75> HA
[3:31:49] <DSD24> He's so cool
[3:31:50] <Monkeyweed21> would Pat become a vampire
[3:31:54] <%manwithboxonhead> I still think that Caine's origin story is till metal.
[3:31:54] <%0dokuro> Ba bye
[3:31:55] <+jorgamund> yeah, it's silly to believe in all that Biblical legend stuff when ZOMBIE VAMPIRES IN HAUNTED BUILDINGS exist and talk to you on a daily basis
[3:31:55] <%spiritofmojave> He's so fucking sassy, I love this boy
[3:31:57] <dsauce999> A L I E N S
[3:31:57] <mrjohncarlton> Fucking Aliens man, we all decended from Kars
[3:31:57] <ScreamingMeat> @konekoryugamine The strength of a vampire depends on its generation. The next generation is always weaker than the last so Thin-Bloods are the youngest generation
[3:31:58] <BigCoffee> 300 years old is still young
[3:31:59] <ooblag> "I don't believe in magic. But we're dead"
[3:31:59] <@Pandora_Prime> Ah Beckett. The Drizzit DoUrden of VTM
[3:32:02] <%mercado94> yay?
[3:32:02] <PSI_Guy95> ya did it
[3:32:03] <DracaenaLeaf> it was still a shitshow
[3:32:03] <Viperwing999> "without killing anyone"
[3:32:04] <%AlvinTheLiar> Woo
[3:32:05] <triangularblasphemy> Beckett's gonna go home and jerk it
[3:32:06] <starotter70> yay
[3:32:07] <dsauce999> RADICAL XP
[3:32:07] <a1u5> As you're talking, SWAT is being sent to your location
[3:32:08] <%spiritofmojave> Woo!
[3:32:08] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Are they really dead though?
[3:32:11] <mesamus> uh pat, the guards died by the laser
[3:32:12] <DSD24> No one will believe those guards
[3:32:15] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> !Masquerade Preserved!
[3:32:15] <benhart18> 'Stones brother to death,' gets off on manslaughter
[3:32:18] <%RadicalPirate> And the Masquerade was totally preserved!
[3:32:18] <DSD24> They were all high
[3:32:21] <ayskoh> and all those cops totally didnt think you were a vampire
[3:32:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can't die from the laser.
[3:32:26] <%rdark_ksu> If you think about it being unable to go out in day would suck ass. So much time lost. Even if you live forever
[3:32:26] <+Pyrotix690> Didnt a bunch of guards die to the laser ?
[3:32:26] <VritraReiRei> Ok I looked it up guys, Robin Atkin does like, 5 character voices for this game. God damn this game has some pretty STACKED VAs
[3:32:27] <%0dokuro> Guards may have died from the lazers
[3:32:28] <%Kirby_Sauce> Laser killed some guards pat
[3:32:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Neither can NPCs.
[3:32:29] <%manwithboxonhead> CNN: We had a guy breaking and entering the Museum and run around getting shot and took some things.
[3:32:30] <%dukenux> Pish posh
[3:32:30] <%AlvinTheLiar> And you can sell all the lead in you for a profit
[3:32:31] <%0dokuro> Maybe
[3:32:33] <ooblag> CGI blood effects
[3:32:35] <%Niney_Who> The cops thought you were a Mummy not a Vampire
[3:32:38] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @ayskoh they thought he was an alien, weren't you paying attention?
[3:32:41] <%konekoryugamine> Hey, if Vampires don't have reflections, then does that mean they don't show up on cell phone pictures?
[3:32:44] <+Noxybaru> Masquerade: preserved
[3:32:44] <%Kirby_Sauce> Guards died by laser
[3:32:44] <+EdenOfLove> nevuh evuh
[3:32:47] <%AncelDeLambert> I can't believe Pat just walked through that whole level
[3:32:48] <triangularblasphemy> The cops have decided to just let it go. That was four boxes of weapons discharge forms they have to fill out.
[3:32:49] <KeystoneA1> Mummies also exist in this universe
[3:32:53] <+Keiyum> vampires don't show up on camera
[3:32:56] <+Scarlet_Crow> Magic doesn't mean religion is true, but in this case we know religion is true. Also there are gods, their creations, and their acts all over the place. The ultimate evidence of god existing in this universe is the fact divine power can be channeled by the truly faithful and blessed.
[3:32:58] <+TheWallOfMeat> I don't think that laser does damage
[3:32:58] <%goose_attack_almanac> Would you believe it if a Scooby-doo monster ran in to your police station?
[3:32:59] <DSD24> They thought you were a hobo like in Condemed
[3:33:00] <%thackattack00> Good ole source ladders
[3:33:01] <InugamiTheHound> right wing vampire attacks museum!
[3:33:03] <prophetdisharmonious> The supervisor probably thinks they're stormtroopers with how much ammo they wasted
[3:33:03] <+dark_willow> this is very clearly the first source 2 game
[3:33:04] <derap41> Bitch clean your face
[3:33:04] <%manwithboxonhead> CNN: He ran around in a red leotard and suprisingly there were no casualites.
[3:33:05] <NocturnalRites> @konekoryugamine only if you are a lasombra

[3:34:38] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@RadicalPirate) (warning)
[3:34:41] <ScreamingMeat> @konekoryugamine Actually there is a funny thing about that myth. Mirrors used to be lined with silver to make them reflective and that was why it was said that a vampire wouldn't cast a reflection. Modern mirrors are lined with Aluminum tho, so if vampires WERE real they would have a reflection today
[3:34:44] <dsauce999> DRINK DA RED JUICE
[3:34:46] <triangularblasphemy> @GarbageNirvana So you can see its expression. So you can KNOW HOW IT FEELS
[3:34:46] <%AncelDeLambert> The Tzimisce are basically Bloodborne
[3:34:46] <Captain_Joe1911> Emlo picnicMon
[3:34:47] <+MrMcCrabby> its a chalice because you drink blood from it (or something)
[3:34:47] <starotter70> Unless their human

[3:34:49] <Monkeyweed21> spoil the screamers
[3:34:50] <ithirstforfreddurst> @RadicalPirate it was a person!
[3:34:52] <%RadicalPirate> Why does that chalice have an eye?!?
[3:34:53] <+thebonebard> @GarbageNirvana well it was made by a tzimisce
[3:34:55] <+Noxybaru> Unless you've got like, human children. Fuck those guys
[3:34:58] <%RadicalPirate> ewww
[3:34:59] <DSD24> Tell them the endings to all of their favorite movies
[3:35:00] <%AlvinTheLiar> You use it like Bear Grylls uses a snake
[3:35:02] <%lizard0tm> SPoil the children, unless they're human
[3:35:04] <%Niney_Who> Pat you got a living lovecraftian estus flask
[3:35:04] <prophetdisharmonious> wait, there was a faster way to go to her?? Dang, i always took the long route...
[3:35:06] <SparkAfterDark> a chalice is a cup and a cup is used to hold liquids for drinking, that thing holds liquids for drinking ergo it's a chalice
[3:35:13] <+notsosober9> LOVELY EVENING
[3:35:16] <starotter70> Tja
[3:35:18] <NocturnalRites> The Tzimisce are like Hellraiser
[3:35:18] <+zeegaming> Man the Tzsimisce are so cool I wish I could fleshcraft
[3:35:18] <%nekodelic> @angriestpat you can probably read a book now that you spoke to Beckett
[3:35:19] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> It has an eye because it used to be a person until the Tzimisce got to them
[3:35:23] <%AncelDeLambert> that thing is a wineskin for blood
[3:35:23] <%konekoryugamine> You ever see a sea lamprey, Pat?

[3:35:36] <@commanderclaw> go kiss Lacroix's ass and get more XP
[3:35:37] <+zeegaming> I wanna follow the path of evolution and become as god
[3:35:40] <starotter70> yay
[3:35:42] <%RadicalPirate> So damn gross
[3:35:46] <%AncelDeLambert> I swear there's a free scholarship point somewhere but fuck if I can remember
[3:35:47] <Monkeyweed21> why doesn't the vampire hunter attack the building labelled LACROIX
[3:35:48] <Sloavon> *dropping a log in the street* Lovely evening!
[3:35:48] <%Laecerelius> Now level up your Int so you can learn more!
[3:35:53] <Viperwing999> time to bleed all over the books
[3:35:55] <+seaearthandsky> @AngriestPat if you haven't already been asked this a thousand times, what do you think of jokers gameplay showcase?
[3:35:55] <ooblag> Worth it. It's basically free XP
[3:35:56] <%MagickBurritoh> I wish I could get a scholarship so easy
[3:35:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> Try selling the skill book and buy it back twice
[3:35:57] <dsauce999> SCHUM
[3:35:59] <DracaenaLeaf> remember you could use fat larry with book exploits
[3:36:04] <%konekoryugamine> Oh wow this game is far more complex than I thought it would be.
[3:36:06] <KeystoneA1> @AncelDeLambert Talking to Beckett after you get the sarcophagus will get you the point
[3:36:10] <%konekoryugamine> I like it.
[3:36:10] <NocturnalRites> or you could up your baby level int
[3:36:16] <mrjohncarlton> If you suck LaCroix's dick he'll give you that exp Kappa
[3:36:19] <%Laecerelius> Yeah that's better
[3:36:21] <DSD24> @Monkeyweed21 Because they need a reason to explain to the cops which they don't
[3:36:27] <%konekoryugamine> Too bad my interest in vampires died when I read THE NOVELS BASED ON FUCKING TRUE BLOOD
[3:36:29] <KeystoneA1> Put it in security
[3:36:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> Sell the skill book and buy it back twice
[3:36:31] <%Laecerelius> Cool
[3:36:32] <RupanSen> scurity is worth it
[3:36:33] <SparkAfterDark> who needs intelligence when you can just look up the answers
[3:36:35] <%Laecerelius> Upgrade that security
[3:36:36] <$Slimshazbot> @monkeyweed21 he thinks it's that fancy water company
[3:36:38] <KeystoneA1> Finance is worthless tho
[3:36:38] <natebud> why not
[3:36:40] <%konekoryugamine> Yeah TRUE BLOOD SUCKS.
[3:36:44] <jijipose> Finance is kind of shit
[3:36:44] <%manwithboxonhead> sure
[3:36:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Try the book dupe tho!
[3:36:53] <benhart18> Why not just spend them when you need them?
[3:36:53] <%konekoryugamine> There were only 2 characters in that WHOLE SERIES who were WORTH my time
[3:36:54] <%manwithboxonhead> Ding
[3:36:55] <%GrayMatterMiner> oh jeez true blood
[3:36:55] <%RadicalPirate> Finance feels like such an afterthought
[3:37:00] <DraxTD> drink from the H.P. Sippy Cup @AngriestPat
[3:37:00] <%AncelDeLambert> Finance is garbage
[3:37:00] <TwinBat> bruhs
[3:37:01] <%mercado94> wat

[3:37:10] <%AncelDeLambert> you find guns everywhere to sell, fuck finance
[3:37:10] <Ion_Laser> good points
[3:37:10] <+Noxybaru> I like that they're called "tomes" like it's not just Slim Jim's Guide to Lock Jimmying
[3:37:14] <%manwithboxonhead> We are the SMRTS
[3:37:15] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I think you can get some free finance, yeah?
[3:37:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> Dammit Pat, you didn't even try the dupe!
[3:37:17] <%lizard0tm> The number go up
[3:37:18] <prophetdisharmonious> It's free realestate
[3:37:18] <%konekoryugamine> Am I pissing in the wind here?

[3:37:22] <dsauce999> BRUTE SMARTS
[3:37:25] <Tornadobear> Can vampires have wood? I mean, they are cold blooded creatures
[3:37:25] <SparkAfterDark> it's FREE REAL E-STATS
[3:37:25] <DraxTD> 0.o
[3:37:25] <ooblag> Finance is kind of worth it for end game, so you can just buy infinite ammo
[3:37:25] <TwinBat> GUARD CAT
[3:37:28] <%manwithboxonhead> Yea...

[4:53:39] <%manwithboxonhead> WHAT
[4:53:46] <ScreamingMeat> I've never seen a design like this for a Shotgun. It looks like an assault rifle
[4:53:53] <+TheWallOfMeat> oh, so that's what Blood Boil does
[4:53:55] <+TheWallOfMeat> sweet
[4:53:57] <ithirstforfreddurst> @ScreamingMeat it's a real gun
[4:53:58] <%Lambda_man> It's a spas-15 @ScreamingMeat
[4:54:00] <ミュウレ4242> and blood magic saves the day again.
[4:54:00] <therakishsage> Gotta switch between the two.
[4:54:01] <%radda343> it's a real gun
[4:54:03] <%Lambda_man> real gun
[4:54:08] <AlasterAngelo> Thaumatergy is busted yes
[4:54:11] <+Mittensbro> @ScreamingMeat Look up "Spas 15" on google images. That's what it looks like
[4:54:11] <HeadsHeldHigh> geal run
[4:54:12] <Dehlome> mag fed shotguns are cool
[4:54:12] <Wan6Saber> @ScreamingMeat auto shotguns are like this too?
[4:54:15] <+TheWallOfMeat> I think he can just Salvo + Boil this whole mission
[4:54:15] <silver__viii> Big nerd powers are helping out a lot here it seems

[4:54:30] <%0dokuro> Thaumatergy is a real gun ;)
[4:54:31] <Wan6Saber> oops, wrong symbol!
[4:54:31] <%Das_Bass> the SPAS-15 is also semi-auto
[4:54:31] <derap41> @ScreamingMeat its was an attempt at making a a automatic and pump action shotgun in one
[4:54:32] <ithirstforfreddurst> god blood magic is so good
[4:54:34] <Atzros> He has a pretty good gun to use
[4:54:36] <+jimmyjams1688> it's supposed to be an either OR design, pump when you need it, semi preffereably

[5:35:41] <Mnightshyamallama> 6 is fun, imo not as fun as 0 but still way better than kiwami one
[5:35:43] <%MagickBurritoh> bags are not usually hard
[5:35:44] <%Hammerknife> @AngriestPat depends on how bad kiwami is. if its a total garbage fire shitshow that'll be fun to watch but if it's just bland it'll be bland to watch

[5:44:09] <NickHatesSnow> @Kirby_Sauce Please do it you coward
[5:44:18] <+Promessa_EX> Persona 4 is more important than other personas

[5:44:48] <%CaptainTubaki> LUL
[5:44:51] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Pretty much
[5:44:51] <%crimsonharvest> its more like the free part of a patreon is the demo or shareware
[5:44:54] <%The_Esquana> Youtube special edition
[5:44:54] <Nina96> kinda
[5:44:56] <%TheShal> Do you DOWNLOAD the videos?
[5:44:56] <%Hammerknife> it's not 'dlc' anyomre since its not even downloaded
[5:44:56] <SonicD4> stream over?
[5:44:57] <corepool> not wrong
[5:44:58] <bloodypurpledog> It should be the Goku sprite from legacy of Goku
[5:44:58] <%CaptainTubaki> yes they are
[5:45:02] <$RubberFistFight> it's more like youtube early access
[5:45:02] <%Kirby_Sauce> I can't change my name for 2 months. SHIT
[5:45:02] <+Promessa_EX> "Hey guys, wanna pay to read a movie review"
[5:45:05] <starotter70> @ShichiNoBushi Yes, one of the Shonen Jump games
[5:45:05] <%Hammerknife> it's more like how porn works
[5:45:07] <big_chugnus> Hey Paddy
[5:45:08] <RupanSen> LaCroix for Smash!
[5:45:09] <%TheShal> Unless you download the videos, it's not DLC. It's Pay per View
[5:45:09] <+w4rhe4rt_> youtube is free
[5:45:10] <%SirGO0SE> so the extra content
[5:45:11] <rubbishbinge> unyeah
[5:45:12] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> I'd get pissed if one piece got put into smash
[5:45:17] <Nina96> @AngriestPat yeah like dlc pat
[5:45:18] <%SirGO0SE> so the downloadable extra content
[5:45:19] <%CaptainTubaki> oof good analogy LUL
[5:45:20] <%velemi> so dlc
[5:45:21] <emillionghost> nah
[5:45:22] <+cinder_chan> I think that depends on the content pat
[5:45:25] <Ion_Laser> so patreon is satellite radio
[5:45:38] <ShichiNoBushi> Yeah. I thought of a Shonen Jump game after I posted that.

[5:48:36] <dsauce999> Just play bloodborne instead
[5:48:36] <%crimsonharvest> its cool but it lacks coherence in some places too?
[5:48:36] <%SirGO0SE> 60% cool
[5:48:44] <%AncelDeLambert> everything actually involving Cthulu in that game sucks
[5:48:52] <+w4rhe4rt_> wait for The Sinking City
[5:48:53] <haveswordmuststing> yeah just play bloodborne
[5:49:03] <worldbrand> you totally said pillars of eternity
[5:49:15] <%crimsonharvest> chat was very confuse
[5:49:22] <%spiritofmojave> Pillars of Exile
[5:49:29] <Slomyalon> a good night to all. farewell

[5:49:37] <+VashyronM> path of eternity/pillars of exile
[5:49:38] <DetroitSentai> Exile of Eternity
[5:49:38] <starotter70> Same game honestly
[5:49:39] <haveswordmuststing> Divinity, Exile of Tyranny
[5:49:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> path of exile is rad
[5:49:45] <%crimsonharvest> i liked titan quest but does Grim Dawn seem slower and boringer?
[5:49:47] <IndoorSitup> You gonna be streaming Path of Exile soon?
[5:50:01] <dsauce999> Wow, very poignant
[5:50:08] <%Kirby_Sauce> Depression art is the best art
[5:50:11] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@big_chugnus) (warning)
[5:50:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> I don't think boringer is a word
[5:50:19] <HoldBtoRun> B I G P E P I S
[5:50:20] <%Hammerknife> grim dawn was okay but it didn't capture me the way titan quest did
[5:50:30] <%Hammerknife> as soon as i beat gd on normal i uninstalled
[5:50:33] <haveswordmuststing> speaking of not diablo games, anyone else like Van Hellsing
[5:50:34] <lloyddboy> pointy pepis

[5:51:41] <+RushUnplugged> the best thing in Sekiro is the giantdad reference guy
[5:51:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> is this anal condor
[5:51:44] <foreverN2dust> The moonlight sword doesn't always do energy blast anyways.
[5:51:46] <DetroitSentai> What about the laser version in armored core
[5:51:51] <DomunDomunDomun> It's the moonlight greatsword though.
[5:51:58] <%marsano168> like looking at sekiro the moonlight greatsword just doesnt work for the game
[5:52:06] <dsauce999> Loser
[5:52:10] <+AncientToco> It super is pat. In armored core its a fucking laser
