[0:13:06] <Caidezes> It really is.
[0:13:07] <$liger_zero_jager> Lappy is my stand
[0:13:07] <%changdesu> Save 0
[0:13:09] <%starotter70> Also other games build off of it later
[0:13:10] <gustavozxd> it's a good videogame

[0:13:22] <gustavozxd> just don't play kiwami 1
[0:13:26] <SilverFaustX> start with zero, skip 1 and play 2
[0:13:26] <Twoiis> Could it ruin it for the rest?
[0:13:27] <%chronotriggerhappy123> Kuze the boss
[0:13:30] <%weissguard> *PLEDGE OF DEMON Intensifies*
[0:13:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> I woul recommend playing 0 after 5
[0:13:39] <KnightAsteran> @spacehouse sadly no, I don't think there even is any beaches on the ark
[0:13:39] <+wsmccall> pat how much of this game have you played?
[0:13:41] <+King_floppy> so play 0 LAST because the other games just wont be as good?
[0:13:43] <%chronotriggerhappy123> dude is the epitome of returning boss fight
[0:13:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> Cause it doesn't add anything if you play chronologically
[0:13:56] <%arcaderabbit48> Yeah, friendly remidner that the mosnters we use as Stands are definitely NOT happy about it. This is not a Persona or SMT situation. It is literally chained and collared and writhing in pain

[0:34:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I'm on the file after this one, sooooo...I gotta stop after you finish this file.
[0:34:50] <%Louie_Salmon> Ah, the parry
[0:34:54] <@SSaryn> Yeah. It's pretty fucking incredible.
[0:34:55] <%worldbrand> oh wow I didnt realize they were so cinematic
[0:35:01] <%starotter70> I gotta try that more
[0:35:03] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Like what Woolie suggested for Royal Guard?
[0:35:05] <Tucker0603> DAYUM
[0:35:05] <%GarbageNirvana> Did that just auto-bind him
[0:35:08] <%VanaSkiller> weewoo
[0:35:12] <Soul_Intern> yeah
[0:35:12] <Angry_Ev1L> fucking sick
[0:35:13] <combomaniadeluxe> fuck this game looks cool. really torn between getting this ir daemon x machina
[0:35:16] <%bakiinthedemon> Man I love the camera angles in this game
[0:35:16] <Axle13j> Yooo
[0:35:17] <Soul_Intern> YEAH
[0:35:18] <star_feline> Now THAT'S some police brutality
[0:35:18] <%Louie_Salmon> Which of course, requires you to let an attack come at you while your stand isn't out. Pretty ballsy
[0:35:23] <assfordayz> Police brutality.
[0:35:24] <%chronotriggerhappy123> @GarbageNirvana yeah, perfect call sync with sword gets an autobind
[0:35:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Btw Pat. You're gonna love the next legion.
[0:35:30] <spacecatstreams> so uh, platinum games... am i right?
[0:35:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> X SLASH
[0:35:35] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> God it's so fucking cook
[0:35:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> Daemon x machina has a dope Switch controller.
[0:35:38] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> cool
[0:35:41] <%BioApple> you know, when you really think about it all the jojos are kind of bitches for not fighting alongside their stands
[0:35:42] <%chronotriggerhappy123> @GarbageNirvana each Legion has a special perfect call sync attack
[0:35:44] <assfordayz> How did you increased your max HP?
[0:35:46] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> it's pretty cook
[0:35:47] <%Typhaeon> Tow cabled
[0:35:49] <haveswordmuststing> @spacecatstreams what makes you say that Kappa
[0:35:49] <%Louie_Salmon> That chain sync attack has a sick follow-up btw
[0:35:58] <%kyh9> Remember Chain Jump Attacking
[0:35:59] <%rdark_ksu> !uptime
[0:35:59] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 36m 1s.
[0:36:06] <Ether101_Prime> Just realized those are Eva 01's colors.
[0:36:11] <%Kashi_Nin> OK time to make some biscuits for the stew. Catch you fine folks in a bit
[0:36:11] <%chronotriggerhappy123> @assfordayz upgrading your police rank by doing everything and solving cases
[0:36:12] <Hydrapissed> SourPls
[0:36:16] <%GarbageNirvana> I really need to spend some time in the training room
[0:36:18] <%Louie_Salmon> @assfordayz Each rank increases it by 100, which is basically the sum of your chapter points
[0:36:20] <Onmi_Khaos> But Pat, What's the point of getting better if there's not even a ranking system
[0:36:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> pistol seems to be the best weapon for arrow legion
[0:36:21] <%residentfunko> The tell is just like in metal gear rizing where the flash of red and BOOM attack
[0:36:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> Who would win: Minako Arisato or Jolyne Kujo?
[0:36:22] <%worldbrand> this game looks so cool when im not playing it and focusing on what's about to hit me
[0:36:24] <+TheBitingIrish> Getting this as soon as my SD card arrives 4Head
[0:36:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> to accompany
[0:36:32] <Act1Part2> game is badass
[0:36:36] <Act1Part2> I love the chain
[0:36:49] <%kyh9> He really held in there
[0:36:59] <%worldbrand> I believe you can summon your other legion while the first one is using its skill, there might be a slight delay though
[0:37:02] <SulfurousAcid> is Pat use skills now?
[0:37:04] <powerprotoman> have you tried using hit rush and then swapping?
[0:37:05] <%chronotriggerhappy123> yeah arrow unchained is like more dakka
[0:37:07] <%kyh9> Did you know there's a time stop on the dodge-sync attack for arrow?
[0:37:13] <%Louie_Salmon> I love how heavy the greatsword is
[0:37:17] <+HyperCharge_Sam> the standard gun combo with the arrow legion is really good
[0:37:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Hit Rush and switch
[0:37:29] <%chronotriggerhappy123> yeah
[0:37:30] <Hydrapissed> one step closer to jojo char action game
[0:37:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ye
[0:37:32] <shyguysyko954> Hey pat

[0:37:34] <Malziel> PogChamp
[0:37:34] <%Louie_Salmon> Yup
[0:37:35] <%chronotriggerhappy123> you can have 4 of them
[0:37:35] <Soul_Intern> OH MY GOD
[0:37:36] <combomaniadeluxe> god i can't wait for the combo mads of this game
[0:37:37] <Malziel> the TECH
[0:37:37] <%Louie_Salmon> Two stands
[0:37:39] <%Typhaeon> Your stand has a stand!
[0:37:40] <deviljhojho94> All of this game is cool shit
[0:37:42] <%chronotriggerhappy123> ALL OF THEM GET AN UNCHAINED ATTACK
[0:37:49] <%dekkitout> Get a full team attack
[0:37:53] <powerprotoman> The [Dream Police] are inside my head
[0:37:54] <@SSaryn> BTW, if you don't know who Lappy/Marie is, Cassandra Lee Morris is Morgana from P5.
[0:37:58] <JokerNewby> full gun combo with arrow is pretty good
[0:37:59] <agumon9000> Oh wow
[0:37:59] <%residentfunko> C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-COMBO BREAKERRRRRRRR!!!!
[0:38:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> Geez, Officer, how come Comish lets you have TWO Stands?
[0:38:00] <Sokumotanaka> ALL OUT ATTACK
[0:38:01] <Shwepie> @AngriestPat How janky is the game at the start before recapture your Legion and the other half of the combat system?
[0:38:02] <xcompleasedad> This is some of that GOOD anime shit
[0:38:02] <%GarbageNirvana> Damn
[0:38:07] <%kyh9> Did you know the dodge sync-attack for arrow traps enemies in a time bubble?
[0:38:08] <$liger_zero_jager> talk to alan
[0:38:09] <agumon9000> I near the end of the game and I didn't know that lol
[0:38:11] <+Lamario91> that w101 tech
[0:38:13] <fazoburquina> Is Pat playing in normal mode or game journalist mode?
[0:38:23] <Ion_Laser> @fazoburquina normal
[0:38:24] <%Urgotfantasy> tabithuuuuh
[0:38:26] <+chaumiester> Is there a Japanese VO or is it English VO only?
[0:38:28] <%chronotriggerhappy123> @fazoburquina normal of course
[0:38:30] <Fujiwara_92> Man the HQ music is too fucking good Kreygasm
[0:38:31] <SulfurousAcid> have you gotten good at fighting gorrila? @angriestpat

[0:38:45] <TastySammiches> pat is a NORMIE DansGame
[0:38:52] <+LooglePlatinum> hello
[0:38:59] <%GarbageNirvana> And all the major cutscenes are lip-synched to the Japanese audio, which makes English a bit awkward imo
[0:39:00] <%Louie_Salmon> @shwepie It's a little simple in the first hour or so, but there's enough novelty to carry you to when the actual combat system starts
[0:39:02] <+LooglePlatinum> what chapter we on?
[0:39:08] <%miguelrod777> japanese va for the dad is all might and the va for the yellow dd9ne is midoriya

[0:40:29] <%Dr00_PhD> By charming she means tiddy
[0:40:30] <Shwepie> @Louie_Salmon I ask largely because I've seen a lot of people say the controls are terrible, but most of them seem to be missing the fact you can throw/pull your Legion with ZL.
[0:40:34] <ScreamLord> Puppers are watching
[0:40:34] <%miguelrod777> Cockblock him
[0:40:36] <+TheBitingIrish> The scanner said male

[0:40:44] <%dekkitout> You may not like this, but this is the ideal male body!
[0:40:51] <GarbageQueenEllie> Does... Does one of the officers want to *fuck* the dog mascot?
[0:40:54] <$liger_zero_jager> @soul_intern see
[0:40:55] <dukenux> "mano a mano" means man-to-man, face-to-face
[0:40:57] <derekwst3> @TheBitingIrish maybe born male

[0:40:59] <%bakiinthedemon> Has he done the Lappy "cheer people up" side thing yet?
[0:41:00] <Kerozero> I could swear that Alan is a reference to the character designers Zetman
[0:41:04] <gekizenbu> @GarbageQueenEllie the girl inside it is pretty cute tho
[0:41:06] <+TheBitingIrish> @derekwst3 Maybe

[0:41:10] <FalseEyeD> Don't mess up, Lappys are watching.
[0:41:11] <ShichiNoBushi> Don't embarass yourself in front of the girl- I mean mascot.
[0:41:12] <Onmi_Khaos> Who I'm guessing is not in there right now
[0:41:12] <+TheSaintJohn> Steal Lappy's Heart
[0:41:13] <%king_wragles> I'm unsettled with their commitment to pretending the dog costume is real
[0:41:14] <$valriot> WTF is this Gerbil
[0:41:15] <FalseEyeD> Lappy's are awlays watching.

[0:41:32] <%supersugoisenpai1> Playing mind games
[0:41:32] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Lappy the mascot is a guy. Marie, the one inside if female
[0:41:34] <+HyperCharge_Sam> they all pretend because they all like Marie
[0:41:42] <+whitedogg316> ok chat honestly. This or Bayonetta 2???
[0:41:43] <%Louie_Salmon> @screamlord Yeah there's a lot of pitfalls, bad habits, and just not using all the mechanics going around. Which is understandable, since you're controlling two characters. But no the controls are great and those people are nerds
[0:41:43] <%starotter70> Bitch
[0:41:44] <%chronotriggerhappy123> yeah alan is pretty weak

[0:43:52] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I don't like how there's all these named cops. Might as well be death flags
[0:43:52] <%ToadKing> the biggest disappointment in this game is you cant' get POWER JUICE from the vergil vending machine

[0:45:59] <%starotter70> He's already dead
[0:45:59] <doggieo> jeez
[0:46:00] <TastySammiches> I know some people are into it but I can't stand motion assisted aiming
[0:46:02] <%TheSniperJoe> Pat's stand is Woolie..?
[0:46:06] <fazoburquina> LUL
[0:46:08] <+HyperCharge_Sam> the aiming motion controls are really jank in this game
[0:46:08] <%alcors_wisdom> i didnt realize the re-released links crossbows training on the switch
[0:46:09] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> S+
[0:46:11] <assfordayz> congrats.
[0:46:15] <%Laecerelius> PAHFECT!
[0:46:18] <%dekkitout> Technically, you did cheat with your stand
[0:46:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> Gasoline jelly huh
[0:46:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, not a fan of the aiming
[0:46:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> "I'm BETTER than you!!"
[0:46:26] <startstoprepeat> according to policenauts rules, they gotta let you feel them up now
[0:46:26] <combomaniadeluxe> this game seems to have a lot of side content for a platinum game.

[0:46:41] <%starotter70> @xcompleasedad just S+
[0:46:41] <+HyperCharge_Sam> S+ Ranks are also extremely easy to get in this game once you deck out your Legions
[0:46:43] <rytisone> he used the power of a protagonist
[0:46:46] <+jetjagger222> even the heliport BGM is deus ex-esque
[0:46:47] <%floralkami> @TastySammiches it isn't using any motion controls, i didn't hear of any

[1:02:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> My last dumpster was haunted... by rats. And roaches
[1:02:05] <%skizzuto> IT SURE DOES
[1:02:05] <artificiallynatural> IT DOES
[1:02:05] <%SilvaChariot0133> Damn right it does
[1:02:06] <Sokumotanaka> why we gotta check out pat's house?
[1:02:08] <+CarteretGC> wait Pat is a cop?
[1:02:08] <+bustawof> absolutely
[1:02:09] <Twoiis> fer realz?
[1:02:09] <OhioNitsud> i want the dumpster to have a chomp attack
[1:02:09] <keiji_maede> YUP, YUP
[1:02:10] <%VantomPayne> is that fucking burger king
[1:02:11] <%Typhaeon> But it's just a brainless button masher Kappa
[1:02:11] <%skizzuto> Wait till you get Arm Legion
[1:02:13] <daisyyyy> It Does!
[1:02:14] <%joylent_blue> RIGHT?
[1:02:15] <+valkuma> How dare they make a game about cops that doesnt fit my political narrative 😡
[1:02:15] <derekwst3> podcast tommorw with jet laged woolie
[1:02:18] <%TenderBabyBacon> Yeah hauted dumpsters
[1:02:21] <dukenux> 1PM ET?
[1:02:21] <%Louie_Salmon> It's the only JoJo game anyone ever needs
[1:02:23] <artificiallynatural> Woolie's back finally?
[1:02:25] <+chaumiester> Is Woolie still in Nippon?
[1:02:27] <+LooglePlatinum> you sence the wollie hole
[1:02:28] <+Angrec> @AngriestPat if you had to pick between this or nier:atomata which would you go for?
[1:02:31] <Admiral_PopnFresh> podcast woo!
[1:02:33] <%ElenaManetta> YOU kick ass
[1:02:35] <KohryuZX> chances that this game will come to ps4?
[1:02:36] <%ElenaManetta> i mean you ARE ASS
[1:02:38] <%Dr_DangerPhD> The best thing about this game is that its an evolution of V's cpmbat gameplay from DMCV but 1000 times better
[1:02:40] <combomaniadeluxe> WOAH
[1:02:41] <rytisone> Woolie will porbably be jetlagged to hell
[1:02:41] <%Typhaeon> Oh shit
[1:02:42] <%arancet> @AngriestPat im sure you get this about every game, but this one does seem like a good woolie+pat candidate
[1:02:45] <zenith0111> DUNGEON
[1:02:46] <ShichiNoBushi> I think these are like Alfheim missions.
[1:02:47] <dukenux> Woolie's on a plane
[1:02:48] <%chronotriggerhappy123> YOINK
[1:02:53] <CrypticMochi> I feel like Vending Machine-chan would be every depressed office worker’s therapist
[1:02:57] <daisyyyy> Jojo's Bizzare Evangelion Rider is great!
[1:02:57] <%Louie_Salmon> When they do the instant load it's so slick
[1:03:02] <dukenux> or already dropped in Canada idk
[1:03:07] <%floralkami> @Angrec i dont think that's fair, with the kind of feelings and story Automata has
[1:03:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> already miles better than me.
[1:03:28] <+Angrec> @floralkami more of a money thing on which to get first
[1:03:29] <assfordayz> Combat is slower than what I imaged
[1:03:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> @CrypticMochi "Officer-kun, this pantsu addiction is starting to effect your work,, kyaaa~!"
[1:03:32] <zenith0111> Is the Beyond Two Souls 2???
[1:03:36] <Admiral_PopnFresh> so why does pat like the archer Legion?
[1:03:36] <daisyyyy> They used that 2B ass tech for sure
[1:03:40] <T_Sasquatch> The switch finally has one good gamw
[1:03:40] <Futurecity10> Pat, what is the lore between platinum and that dude at Capcom
[1:03:41] <ScreamLord> Those little Fox/Cat dudes are Digimon as fuck!
[1:03:43] <Onmi_Khaos> @AngriestPat Do you think they 'redeemed' Fordola so they could fake the player out with Yotsuyu?
[1:03:45] <combomaniadeluxe> so in terms of gameplay how complex is compared to something like dmc 5?
[1:03:47] <+emperri> does this game have an actual reason for being on the switch only?
[1:03:50] <%Louie_Salmon> @angrec This also wouldn't exist without Automata, so that's kinda weird choice.
[1:03:53] <%chronotriggerhappy123> oh yeah, there are sync attacks OUT OF BLADE MODE
[1:03:59] <%worldbrand> @emperri ninty funding
[1:04:00] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Nintendo payed Platinum to make it
[1:04:02] <+Bigdrifter210> DEAD ON
[1:04:02] <+Frankyzappa> THAT'S SO FUCKING COOL
[1:04:05] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @combomaniadeluxe We've only just gotten Gunslinger
[1:04:07] <%joylent_blue> emperri Platinum and Nintendo are like this | |
[1:04:08] <DevinMayCry> @emperri Yeah its a Nintendo franchise
[1:04:08] <daisyyyy> Nintendo paid for it
[1:04:09] <%Keyd00d> money
[1:04:13] <Naho_Saenoki> @emperri Kamiya made a comment about Nintendo being their investor for it.
[1:04:14] <OhioNitsud> dope
[1:04:15] <%chronotriggerhappy123> WEEWOOWEEWOOWEEWOOWEEWOO
[1:04:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yo
[1:04:20] <star_feline> Good combo
[1:04:21] <+serranobros> is this capped at 30 fps?
[1:04:23] <suikudo> If only it wasnt being held hostage by the switch
[1:04:27] <%Roasted_Pheasant> P O L I C E
[1:04:27] <zenith0111> Damn guess I'll never play Bayonetta or Astral Chain :(
[1:04:29] <DevinMayCry> @serranobros Yes
[1:04:30] <Manwad> could you just chain unleash your Legions?
[1:04:31] <%starotter70> @serranobros Locked at 30
[1:04:31] <%floralkami> @Angrec i would say get Automata since it's most likely on super sale,but get this later when the price is dropped abit. Both will give hours of fun, tho Automata is more dramatic
[1:04:34] <%chronotriggerhappy123> @serranobros yes, because the switch, but its a solid 30
[1:04:36] <derekwst3> i need a name for a made up element that can hard as rock, black with sparkles that looks like a stary night?
[1:04:40] <%alcors_wisdom> ghost busted
[1:04:40] <combomaniadeluxe> @Sphincter_Spelunker are you telling me that this game has style system
[1:04:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> S+!!!
[1:04:41] <ShichiNoBushi> The game is nice enough to give you all the drops after you leave.
[1:04:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> crushin it
[1:04:42] <+TheBitingIrish> 'HELD HOSTAGE' HE SAYS LUL
[1:04:43] <%Keyd00d> Just buy a Switch?
[1:04:44] <DevinMayCry> @zenith0111 Why not? Just get a switch dude
[1:04:46] <Soul_Intern> WEEWOOWEEWOO
[1:04:47] <%Roasted_Pheasant> You.... did it...
[1:04:48] <%Louie_Salmon> @serranobros Yeah, but never falls below it, so it's okay.
[1:04:48] <%dekkitout> Dumpster's -NOT- Haunted
[1:04:49] <%Dr00_PhD> @AngriestPat Out of the 2 you have right now which legion is your favorite?
[1:04:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> Come on, guys. The Switch OBVIOUSLY isn't making enough money.
[1:04:53] <%ToadKing> ToadKing subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! but pat i was told the combat in this game was just button mashing!

[1:06:07] <thebiganxiety> If the stands are gonna do the wee woo, would it be in a patrick star voice?

[1:10:52] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Pat, you did this last mission
[1:10:52] <%dekkitout> "The Legions can interfere with signals"
[1:10:52] <%chronotriggerhappy123> that it could CUT SIGNALS
[1:10:53] <%skizzuto> when you got blade mode they told you it cuts electrical currents
[1:10:53] <%Laecerelius> Did you forget how you can cut signals, Pat?
[1:10:54] <Fujiwara_92> STANDS PAT
[1:10:55] <ShichiNoBushi> Sword can cut signals. It's stand magic.

[1:11:19] <+bigboyeggo> Jebaited
[1:11:20] <DevinMayCry> Even on enemies you are cutting signals inside their dumb digital bodies
[1:11:20] <%Dr_DangerPhD> yeah, the game with sword hand ghosts and cutting radio signals is what's weird lmao
[1:11:20] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Jebaited
[1:11:20] <%starotter70> Good job, you fucked it up
[1:11:22] <%GarbageNirvana> It's bullshit

[1:11:25] <%cylish> no you didnt
[1:11:26] <Soul_Intern> You didnt
[1:11:27] <%chronotriggerhappy123> it cheats

[1:11:29] <%joylent_blue> good job sword
[1:11:29] <FalseEyeD> We did it, we saved the city
[1:11:30] <ShichiNoBushi> This mission must be horrible for anyone with colorblindness.
[1:11:30] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> good job, stand
[1:11:30] <CptBritches> Dumbass
[1:11:30] <%Nina96> u failed it
[1:11:32] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you have a look of disapproval on your face, it's great.
[1:11:32] <+Snorlax321> he said it would take out 3 buildings hes an expert
[1:11:34] <+lucaflow> No you didn't
[1:11:34] <rosemon5001> you actually made it blow
[1:11:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> trashcans
[1:11:36] <+Dubcrookz> just a prank bro
[1:11:38] <+DeaconBluesClues> WE SAVED THE CITY PATRICK
[1:11:39] <%Keyd00d> what bomb
[1:11:39] <ShichiNoBushi> Like a cat.
[1:11:39] <+bigboyeggo> you cut the wrong signal you dingus
[1:11:40] <%alcors_wisdom> @ShichiNoBushi it is
[1:11:40] <snoozeaholic> who hired Ted
[1:11:42] <rbakervv> he fucked, i did it right, the bomb didn't go off
[1:11:43] <+lucaflow> It exploded PAT
[1:11:46] <Jaller101514> you cut 2 at once
[1:11:47] <$povertysenpai> Well I mean electromagnetic signals are just energy I'm sure your legion can cut through it
[1:11:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat you confused blue and purple again
[1:11:49] <%Dr00_PhD> 5 more
[1:11:49] <CptBritches> You fucked it up
[1:11:50] <Sokumotanaka> @DevinMayCry Gotta shatter your expectations. Legion are totally persona. Summon in a blue light, come from a parallel world, you wield multiple, it's attached to a chain and a silent protag
[1:11:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> SICK
[1:11:51] <+Karasseram> nah that was a fail it doesnt pop if you do it right
[1:11:52] <assfordayz> How there isnt any fall damage?
[1:11:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> Iris is such a good name for an interface
[1:11:54] <+Edrem> yes you did
[1:11:55] <%Louie_Salmon> The sword legion literally has the vague stand ability to "Cut signals", which extends even to enemy attacks. It's so JoJo it's ridiculous
[1:11:55] <powerprotoman> you cut 2
[1:11:55] <TurtleButter> yes you diiiid
[1:11:56] <Blurredborderlines> They literally explained how sword legion cuts signals when you first get it and it wss re-explained in the arrow legion boss fight and he's somehow confused by this?
[1:11:56] <+Edrem> white signal
[1:11:57] <rbakervv> you cut two at once
[1:11:58] <%Laecerelius> All of this can clean up reminds me of Mega Man Legend
[1:11:58] <%Divryne> Yah you did you cut two at the same time.
[1:11:59] <%dekkitout> You get xp for NOT littering
[1:11:59] <%starotter70> Wow, Pat's recycling like a decent human being
[1:12:01] <%cylish> you cute white
[1:12:01] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That was LEWD
[1:12:01] <%Keyd00d> you did
[1:12:01] <+Karasseram> he cut two signals at once
[1:12:07] <%Mekhet09> Pat it's stand of course it can do weird things.
[1:12:10] <%alcors_wisdom> damn if only pat knew what color purple was
[1:12:12] <Jaller101514> i got a different outcome
[1:12:12] <+Pomer> Guys be careful crazy talk will fuck the game just let him have it ;n;
[1:12:13] <%Keyd00d> no
[1:12:19] <%RubberFistFight> It asked him to cut the blue wire, so he cut the purple one. Kappa
[1:12:19] <deviljhojho94> recycling is badass
[1:12:21] <%Voidwyvern> I instantly cut two wires on accident in my game lol
[1:12:22] <%SilvaChariot0133> RIP civvie
[1:12:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> pat
[1:12:24] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Fucking litter bugs.
[1:12:26] <cherrycottontail> yeah i had that same problem, the legion cut something that the game wasn't telling me it was cutting
[1:12:28] <snoozeaholic> This is the quality gameplay weve been waiting for
[1:12:31] <%Lurantis_> Pat always knows what to do apatSmug
[1:12:34] <%Neryl_> LUL PAT PICKING UP LITTER AGAIN LUL
[1:12:34] <+rei0> pat the litterer taking trash out of the street?
[1:12:39] <+SaurianCrash> what is ?
[1:12:42] <%Mekhet09> These people are savages.
[1:12:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> Wait, there was actually a purple one? Aw fuck...
[1:12:43] <%chronotriggerhappy123> that "purple" is literally blue in some versions, it cheats
[1:12:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yaaay
[1:12:46] <+Sworddemonboggle> MindManners
[1:12:47] <+jkobe34> also eat the icecream

[1:12:53] <%Louie_Salmon> That's a nice setting, yeah
[1:12:53] <deviljhojho94> Imagine forcing Pat "The Rat" Boivin to pick up litter
[1:12:53] <Torruun> Whut
[1:12:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ui color
[1:12:59] <%arancet> its udner color
[1:12:59] <%king_wragles> @NiktenKing so that isn't Mr. Fantastic, but he does voice someone in Catherine. His name is ARI RUBIN.
[1:12:59] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat your character is picking trash up, but you litter in real life
[1:12:59] <zenith0111> Wait for real?
[1:12:59] <%TenderBabyBacon> Pat fights littering
[1:13:00] <%Louie_Salmon> It's really nice actually
[1:13:00] <%alcors_wisdom> turn it down to 0 see what happens
[1:13:03] <daisyyyy> I turned 50 at once it was GREAT
[1:13:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> is it a skill?
[1:13:07] <+Raspada_Ryner> @AngriestPat I don't know if you know this, but if you use a Legion's Hit Rush skill, you can summon another Legion while the other one is out doing it's thing
[1:13:10] <%CopperTucker> sorry I'm late
[1:13:12] <%CopperTucker> what did I miss?

[1:13:25] <%chronotriggerhappy123> @Raspada_Ryner yeah, he fouind out during training
[1:13:29] <%dayz1003> pat learns a new word!

[1:13:38] <%Mekhet09> What's it at Zero?
[1:13:39] <%joylent_blue> yes
[1:13:40] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Weird way to get that.
[1:13:40] <+bigboyeggo> @CarteretGC yes
[1:13:41] <rytisone> having options to select from sure is nice
[1:13:42] <%starotter70> Isn't this game the shit?
[1:13:43] <Zebroneath> Now that's a freaking unlock
[1:13:46] <%chronotriggerhappy123> @Raspada_Ryner ive had 4 of them out at once, it gets nuts

[1:13:47] <GarbageQueenEllie> Purpura
[1:13:47] <%Laecerelius> Man that one civilian is gonna die
[1:13:49] <%dekkitout> But why make it a reward? Maybe I'm the weird one...
[1:13:50] <ShichiNoBushi> Is Platinum trying to teach people to clean up trash and reward them.
[1:13:50] <+SaurianCrash> Saint Rows Colors Bois!
[1:13:51] <Torruun> If only I had a switch, I'd be all over this game
[1:13:51] <CurrySauseBandit> That they unlock menu options slowly is pretty cool. Let's you really adjust to what you like.
[1:13:55] <pillowwasp> That’s why you don’t litter @angriestpat
[1:13:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> customization in this game is crazy
[1:14:05] <Torruun> Did... Did your stand just heal someone by hugging them?
[1:14:08] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Pat, what is your enslaved EVA doing to that women?
[1:14:09] <+bigboyeggo> @dekkitout achievements in this game unlock really weird rewards
[1:14:13] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat toss the garbage on the street or you're a coward and a cheat!
[1:14:13] <Onmi_Khaos> @AngriestPat Just asking again, do you think they did the 'redemption' thing with Fordola specifically to swerve the player with Yotsuyu?
[1:14:15] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat why are you talking like George Takei?
[1:14:20] <+SaurianCrash> Crazy Talk Made real oh crap
[1:14:23] <%Typhaeon> Would adding opacity to real life get Pat to stop littering? 🤔
[1:14:24] <%chronotriggerhappy123> Sword Legion likes giving hugs
[1:14:24] <%worldbrand> if anything this will convince pat that littering lets cops get duty points
[1:14:27] <%dekkitout> Like what additional save slots tajC

[1:14:50] <%Louie_Salmon> @dekkitout To not overwhelm new people, and to have an organic way to draw your attention to the option, and force you to use the normal version and actually appreciate the change. It's super weird but I think it works
[1:14:51] <%Mr_Initials> pick up that can

[1:27:22] <CrypticMochi> Tentacles will survive the apocalypse!
[1:27:22] <SleepyMaribo> i use C
[1:27:26] <artificiallynatural> A/B is good for blade mode. C/D better if you're familiar with bayonetta/MGR
[1:27:28] <%worldbrand> i use defaults
[1:27:29] <This_is_Marco> Why C?
[1:27:29] <%starotter70> I think that's what I use
[1:27:33] <%jaytrident> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead apatDab doodNuts doodNuts
[1:27:34] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> it puts attack on the face buttons

[1:27:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> tentacles are good for only one thing, and that's calamari lunch specials.
[1:27:52] <$PaleBloodInk> C basically makes it Bayo's control scheme.
[1:27:55] <doggieo> Like Bayo
[1:27:56] <Derkinstacker> Stay in A, It messes up aiming with stands
[1:27:57] <%Dr00_PhD> like bayo
[1:27:57] <%SilvaChariot0133> attacks on face
[1:27:58] <%skizzuto> looks like it makes it more like bayo
[1:28:01] <+TheBitingIrish> Hey Pat, what kind of screen protector do you got?
[1:28:03] <artificiallynatural> I'd stay in A
[1:28:07] <%kyh9> So C is basically bayonetta?
[1:28:09] <%joylent_blue> i prefer A, personally
[1:28:10] <$valriot> It's the Bayo/MGR control scheme
[1:28:11] <daisyyyy> I had to use C
[1:28:18] <artificiallynatural> learning a new control scheme this late is annoying
[1:28:20] <SleepyMaribo> C is bayonetta's control scheme
[1:28:26] <CrypticMochi> I like small squid rings as calamari better

[1:29:11] <Ner234> LITTERING
[1:29:14] <%Sh00s> there's a camera option that keeps your character in the center, made the game a little better for me. looks like pat might already be using it
[1:29:17] <%joylent_blue> dukenux its basically how many clues he has
[1:29:19] <SPidERMan8576> Gobulin
[1:29:19] <star_feline> Number GO DOWN
[1:29:22] <artificiallynatural> With C/D, the blademode inputs are all on thumb buttons making it kinda clunky

[1:39:46] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Breakfast_Megapowers subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! Heyo Pat! Do you think this is a game chain-ger?
[1:39:52] <Derkinstacker> Arrow is probably my least favorite stand.
[1:39:57] <+shaderichter_belmont> yeah this is a lot like the final dungeon in Nocturne
[1:40:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the music is giving me Akira vibes. As in the movie.
[1:40:01] <%Keyd00d> Featuring Dante?
[1:40:04] <DevinMayCry> You arent using arrow right the
[1:40:09] <%ToadKing> the music in the astral plane literally sounds like a missing track from nier
[1:40:10] <+bigboyeggo> he missed the pun LUL
[1:40:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> PUN DENIED
[1:40:14] <%Dr00_PhD> He missed the joke

[1:40:18] <+TheBitingIrish> >Ignoring the pun
[1:40:19] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Pun Counter
[1:40:21] <Djinnazz> Like that had time?
[1:40:23] <%chronotriggerhappy123> @AngriestPat btw pat you can get an ability that increases the chain distance on your legion, wich lets you jump even farther
[1:40:24] <%Louie_Salmon> Yeah this has money for sure
[1:40:25] <LandOfTheWay> yeah, the color scheme and geometric design reminds me of the Amala Temple in Nocturne
[1:40:25] <Derkinstacker> Protect your stand
[1:40:28] <+ATentacleMonster> D:
[1:40:28] <%SilvaChariot0133> defend
[1:40:31] <Daniel_Is_I> I don't really like the Legion system, but to each his own
[1:40:34] <deviljhojho94> Maybe my friends will finally play a platinum game, hotdamn
[1:40:34] <%sjay449> sandbag the pun
[1:40:39] <%skizzuto> gotta keep charging it with your legion
[1:40:40] <+El_Bucephalus> Funded by nanomachines, son
[1:40:41] <+ZoltanBMagnus> oh, number go down
[1:40:42] <%Maids4lyfe> he looks like Excalibur Prime
[1:40:49] <%Louie_Salmon> You should really charge that during the fight
[1:40:54] <%Maids4lyfe> or the Guyver
[1:40:58] <%Dementedpenguin> @deviljhojho94 not even ONE game? That's tragic >_>
[1:41:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat has become the woolie
[1:41:04] <Malziel> Give it the good touch Kreygasm
[1:41:05] <%chronotriggerhappy123> defend the point pat, dont use the stand

[1:42:05] <%chronotriggerhappy123> jump over there
[1:42:07] <DevinMayCry> @CptRoach 4?
[1:42:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yea
[1:42:14] <Daniel_Is_I> Wait there are gyro controls?
[1:42:15] <%chronotriggerhappy123> chest above
[1:42:16] <%Estuko> @ShaneWhite his name is short for Pattington
[1:42:17] <TurtleButter> miss that chest, off
[1:42:22] <%skizzuto> I wish the camera was zoomed out a teensy bit more
[1:42:22] <+rei0> i really wished the fps is stable
[1:42:22] <TurtleButter> oof, even.
[1:42:24] <deviljhojho94> The game starts off a bit slugish but that's kind of the point i suposse
[1:42:36] <+skylerpilot> wish the game didn't go black and white and blurry when at low hp
[1:42:40] <%Svanyr> Svanyr subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months, currently on a 32 month streak! 32 months now. Anime copssss. Back on that university grind starting this week, boy I sure cant wait for essay hell. Keep on keepin on
[1:42:41] <mayorrev> just hold the controller still 4Head
[1:42:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @skylerpilot me too
[1:42:47] <ravencloak13> I mean, you have to buy combos.
[1:42:49] <%Louie_Salmon> @angriestpat Btw, have you mapped all your field items to the shortcut wheel? That way, you will be literally unable to use permanent consumables, your dream.
[1:42:49] <doggieo> If it were good gyro i'd be all for it
[1:42:57] <DevinMayCry> @skylerpilot That ruined final boss for me
[1:42:57] <%Mr_Strut> What is the framerate on this?
[1:42:57] <%ShaneWhite> @Estuko I like that LUL that’s even better.
[1:43:00] <+CCCPKi> I wish they didnt decide on a weird gameplay decision to essentially gimp your starting moveset for the first ~3 files but it could be worse
[1:43:02] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Will the Final boss be 2 Chainz?
[1:43:04] <artificiallynatural> Biggest issue is with the camera, also didn't you turn the gyro off?
[1:43:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Man, I could go for a good gyro right now
[1:43:14] <%Farples> @Mr_Strut Locked 30
[1:43:15] <%joylent_blue> Mr_Strut locked 30, very solid tho
[1:43:18] <+ATentacleMonster> The gyro doesn't feel too different than botw if you change the sensitivity, but maybe that's just me
[1:43:18] <%starotter70> I find the Gyro to be unintrusive, so I don't mind
[1:43:20] <%Dr_DangerPhD> if you walk around in the visor mode the framerate gets pretty rough
[1:43:22] <%Sh00s> I use a controller without gyros in it; what do they control?
[1:43:23] <%Estuko> @Breakfast_Megapowers if you predicted the fight just by that name, I'm going to be so upset
[1:43:34] <ravencloak13> 5 bucks says the final boss is an EVA
[1:43:35] <Daniel_Is_I> I'm 8 hours in and didn't even notice there were gyro controls o_O
[1:43:35] <%joylent_blue> i only noticed bad frame drops during the most recent boss fight i did
[1:43:36] <%chronotriggerhappy123> on the other side of the CUT WALLS
[1:43:39] <mujahideenfruityrebels> @sh00s Ice cream

[1:44:03] <%Sh00s> @mujahideenfruityrebels uhh what
[1:44:09] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @Estuko If I predicted the fight based off a dumb joke then Platinum are hard stans for Hip Hop
[1:44:09] <%joylent_blue> assfordayz night night apatGib

[1:52:20] <%alexandrecau> did it
[1:52:21] <%Laecerelius> I guess taking damage doesn't matter in this one
[1:52:21] <%VantomPayne> SSS
[1:52:22] <%skizzuto> this game doesn't penalize you for taking shit tons of damage
[1:52:22] <+MegaMillenniumX> wow...
[1:52:23] <%Dr_DangerPhD> pat bribed the judge
[1:52:24] <%Mekhet09> These rankings are generous as hell.
[1:52:24] <%Ahack13> Dude the ranking system in this game is fucked
[1:52:24] <%FancyHatMan> apatCrazy apatCrazy apatCrazy apatCrazy
[1:52:24] <DevinMayCry> Rank is determined by how varied you are
[1:52:25] <rytisone> Sick Smokin Style
[1:52:25] <Make_me_mad> If you use more than one weapon and legion per fight it's basically a guaranteed S or S+
[1:52:27] <Derkinstacker> You can even take reses and be fine.
[1:52:27] <%BestTeaMaker> you dont get penalized
[1:52:28] <%chronotriggerhappy123> he actually dodged quit a bit and did alot
[1:52:29] <xcompleasedad> PLAY THE SONG
[1:52:29] <Rwctt> Crazy Talk
[1:52:29] <+jkobe34> this game is really lax on grading
[1:52:29] <DarbyV> ranks are more about the variety of moves used instead of time + damage taken in this game
[1:52:30] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Platinum has gone soft.
[1:52:30] <+walternatorz> flawless
[1:52:31] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat that is perfect gameplay right there
[1:52:31] <%ThatOneGameTester> The power of crazy talk is amazing
[1:52:31] <nitro4life2> CRAZY TALK!

[1:52:32] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> not a single hit

[1:52:33] <%Keyd00d> Health doesn't factor
[1:52:33] <mujahideenfruityrebels> What is this, DMC5?
[1:52:34] <Thepothero> S+ HSWP naroWhat
[1:52:37] <artificiallynatural> Damage isn't penalized. Just do all the stuff it wants you to
[1:52:37] <InvaderKAZ> @AngriestPat Taking hits does not lower your rank, its basically just speed and how many mechanics you used
[1:52:37] <funkieboy> C R A Z Y talk
[1:52:38] <%chronotriggerhappy123> its based on STYLE
[1:52:38] <SpaceGuntank> [CRAZY TALK]
[1:52:42] <%Kalz0ne> crazy talk is going stronger everyday
[1:52:44] <%skizzuto> you're mostly graded on how many weapons/legions/skills/etc. you used during the fight
[1:52:45] <+TheSaintJohn> Thistallwoodpass1
[1:52:45] <%Ahack13> I can not for the life of me figure out why I get S+ on some and D on others
[1:52:46] <%miguelrod777> theres no minus pointz so just do lots of sync attks and youre fine
[1:52:46] <KaliasTV> Huh, 4 lives now?

[1:52:52] <TheSinner42> Damage does not mater at all for rank its what/how much you do

[1:52:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I see
[1:52:55] <%SilvaChariot0133> "Wow, I think I did pretty good there..." *D*
[1:52:57] <Daniel_Is_I> Apparently hitting an invulnerable enemy fifty times is stylish

[1:53:07] <+CaptainJax> ay
[1:53:07] <xcompleasedad> Does Hard Mode count damage aginst you?
[1:53:07] <%Anime_Flux> Heya folks
[1:53:08] <%Louie_Salmon> Rank has a LOT to do with variation on this difficulty, PT Ultimate is less forgiving
[1:53:11] <SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat you know there are Eva colors for your legion?
[1:53:12] <%sjay449> the more shit you do in fight = higher rank
[1:53:14] <%skizzuto> apatGib apatGib apatGib
[1:53:14] <Azelstahn> There is one for taking zero damage which is a huge bonus but that's it
[1:53:14] <%starotter70> apatGib
[1:53:15] <%Sh00s> chat backseated so hard they might as well take credit for the S+ apatSmug
[1:53:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yes, he knows. He's using one.
[1:53:20] <%ThatOneGameTester> oh, then pat is gonna win at this ranking system. It's win fast or lose and grind out for power.
[1:53:21] <Marpolo13> :)
[1:53:21] <ravencloak13> I think Crazy Talk is getting stronger cause your playing a game about Stands

[1:53:53] <%joylent_blue> CharredChord do all the tutorial programs

[1:54:30] <ravencloak13> @charredchord It’s one of the first colors you unlock from doing one of the first side quest of the game. Check your menu.
[1:54:33] <%shawntk_> @KaironFortressKnight I'd say it's pretty likely that will happen
[1:54:35] <%Edgy_Macaroon> pat is picking up trash? WTF
[1:54:35] <+TheBitingIrish> huuuuugs......
[1:54:37] <LandOfTheWay> jesus, these people litter almost as much as pat

[1:54:39] <derekwst3> you missed like four cans
[1:54:42] <42nfl19> is that a hug? Looks like a vampire grasp
[1:54:47] <+temporal_zenith> Just imagine if you had enough corruption to see that happen before it suddenly vanished in front of you
[1:54:49] <%starotter70> @KaironFortressKnight I was also thinking about this earlier
[1:54:54] <%ToadKing> pat's just stockpiling ammo for later littering
[1:55:01] <%joylent_blue> a bounty of cans
[1:55:08] <%sjay449> I ate 2 grilled cheese sandwiches, a bag of doritos and a bag of malteasers.... I am a monster NotLikeThis
[1:55:09] <%chronotriggerhappy123> theres more later, but its like a billion cans
[1:55:12] <mujahideenfruityrebels> Rack up those points

[2:09:11] <al0nem0nster> guess it's better to think of them as accessories more than abilities.
[2:09:14] <%Dakuu75> too much of a good thing~
[2:09:14] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That does seem like a lot.
[2:09:14] <Azelstahn> you can just delete the ones you don't want
[2:09:17] <xcompleasedad> Question: Remnant not for awhile, yeah?
[2:09:18] <Derkinstacker> Yeah, the randomness of the secondary traits kinda sucks.
[2:09:19] <%joylent_blue> you can sort them by type which helps, but its still not great
[2:09:19] <%chronotriggerhappy123> only ones worth it are any ones with + skills
[2:09:19] <ShichiNoBushi> A "Fight Looter" or "Flooter"?
[2:09:21] <%Louie_Salmon> Hm, yeah there should have been more slots like automata
[2:09:23] <%Estuko> FeelsBadMan I can't take all that it, It'd break my brain
[2:09:23] <%dekkitout> Is there at least a loadouts system?
[2:09:29] <%Dr00_PhD> Yeah you dont check it for half a mission and then theres like 30 new ones
[2:09:33] <Pompadourius> @xcompleasedad This entire week is Astral Chain and Control
[2:09:43] <xcompleasedad> @Pompadourius Gotcha.
[2:09:43] <DevinMayCry> Delete all non + yeah
[2:09:57] <%Dr_DangerPhD> i found an ability that does 900% damage explosion when my legion runs out of juice lol
[2:09:57] <Admiral_PopnFresh> recurrent issue with Platinum games, too much upgrady shit that changes very little
[2:09:58] <SleepyMaribo> the abilities feel sorta pointless when your swtiching thru 5 of em and they all have different ability loadouts
[2:09:59] <%Dr00_PhD> and River City Girls on thursday
[2:10:22] <%dyedeme> dyedeme subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[2:10:27] <%Black_Machete> Black_Machete subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! MINOR SPOILER not really I just beat the final boss on PT standard and got a S+ But I have no clue how the ranking system works I revived 8 times using items And somehow I still got an S+
[2:10:30] <Pompadourius> Ability system feels like NieR Automata's chip system but not as in depth.
[2:10:32] <%SilvaChariot0133> PARTY HALL
[2:10:36] <This_is_Marco> everyone gets autoheal!
[2:10:40] <%chronotriggerhappy123> @SleepyMaribo i sue them to compensate for their weaknesses, the Arms legion is REALLY SLOW so speed abilities help him
[2:10:41] <cherrycottontail> IT's clearly based off the chip system but with more rng
[2:10:42] <Derkinstacker> Legions have different strengths.
[2:10:49] <Pompadourius> @Black_Machete Damage taken and deaths don't reduce points AT ALL unless you take zero damage for the entire thing.
[2:10:49] <DevinMayCry> @Black_Machete Its based off variety
[2:10:49] <SleepyMaribo> i put the thing that lets me get more upgrae points for the legion on all of them
[2:10:57] <ScreamLord> Turlet
[2:11:01] <Marpolo13> toilet
[2:11:03] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> i think the Rank system puts importance towards either speed or how involved you are in the fight
[2:11:05] <Dr_Mooose> nice
[2:11:05] <Ion_Laser> Big Piss
[2:11:06] <%bevyrage> @Black_Machete apparently it's based on time spent during the fight and how much of the mechanics you use (variety)
[2:11:08] <%starotter70> Nice dump Pat
[2:11:09] <%dekkitout> And here I thought deco farming in MHW was- nvm it's still shit...
[2:11:10] <Lochskye> quick question., is this open world?
[2:11:13] <%chronotriggerhappy123> also the CHAIN DISTANCE ability incereases the range of the stand
[2:11:13] <wookie5358> If the primary desire for a mechanic is a desire to not worry about it, it could probably be better
[2:11:14] <Derkinstacker> No
[2:11:15] <Strider222> poop
[2:11:18] <al0nem0nster> it's mission based
[2:11:18] <%Urgotfantasy> sick dump bro
[2:11:19] <DevinMayCry> @Black_Machete Time has a range of points and then each thing you do adds to your total and the ranks are determined by points you got in the end
[2:11:23] <%Dr_DangerPhD> you can get + abilities that give you buffs regardless of whether you're using that legion or not
[2:11:31] <daisyyyy> I found a couple that do autlsync attacks

[2:12:41] <DevinMayCry> Chie
[2:12:42] <al0nem0nster> @Screamlord you get one weapon that morphs into 3 types, then you upgrade said weapons stats which unlocks new combos

[2:15:12] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat I think they wanted you to take the picture while they were in the tentacle
[2:15:13] <%bevyrage> that's pretty good
[2:15:15] <%joylent_blue> TSmasher1000 he started it and really liked it, got stalled on it due to mind goblins but he liked it

[2:15:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> SEAPANIC
[2:15:34] <%CopperTucker> @TSmasher1000 play it. If you like Tactical RPGs, it's fun. If you like the characters, it's fun
[2:15:35] <+TSmasher1000> @joylent_blue Don't know what that is, but might pick up the game one day when I have the time/funds
[2:15:35] <%Dementedpenguin> I've hated taking pictures in games ever since Dead Rising 1.
[2:15:37] <%Laecerelius> But Pat, I need the photos!
[2:15:40] <%TweetHeart> birbLove
[2:15:40] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Sea Panic sounds like another Platinum game
[2:15:53] <+TSmasher1000> @CopperTucker I've liked other Fire Emblems, but I disliked Fates. Hopefully this one will be better.
[2:15:53] <+Karasseram> taking photos only gives you filters you can completely ignore it
[2:15:54] <%Frunkle24> the world is about to be destroyed, but at least we still have instagram filters
[2:15:55] <ZE_Count> I started playing Control after seeing you playing it Pat and its pretty fun I love this SCP like stuff.
[2:15:56] <+StrawberryPantsu> 12-18 with re-play Value
[2:15:57] <%zeroarturia> Let Pat play guys. This isn't a completionist run
[2:16:01] <Phoenon> Oh cool you can even use Sundowner's weapon in this
[2:16:03] <+TSmasher1000> Thanks chat.
[2:16:06] <%joylent_blue> TSmasher1000 mind goblins as in, Pat's progress in the game was hampered by his own OCD LUL
[2:16:07] <@lewdskeletor13> @angriestpat do you want slow mode? Or is it fine
[2:16:08] <+StrawberryPantsu> Toss up between this and Remnant

[2:16:10] <%MassConnect> y'all should know that the only picture you take are pictures of spiderman
[2:16:12] <%starotter70> Honestly, you only get another photo filter, so it wasn't even that big of a deal
[2:16:12] <%chronotriggerhappy123> ooh a ++ ability
[2:16:13] <tank7013> I swear those tentacles are using the Bayonetta elephant noise
[2:16:14] <%Dr00_PhD> You only needed avery
[2:16:18] <+TSmasher1000> @joylent_blue Sounds like Pat LUL
[2:16:18] <+TheBitingIrish> I would always forget to take pictures of bosses in Windwaker

[2:16:35] <+StrawberryPantsu> IT MATTRES TO US :^)
[2:16:36] <Soul_Intern> But dont worry
[2:16:40] <+parrotman01> This game is half the frame rate of the higher settings of this stream
[2:16:41] <al0nem0nster> meh, ocd completionism
[2:16:42] <+Karasseram> thats why you never take a photo again to shut them up lol
[2:16:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it only matters so much if you want to get every order.
[2:16:43] <%RubberFistFight> @Dakuu75 Oh wait, don't you remember that time on twitter where everyone was screaming at Pat that Red Bull is the source of all of his ills, to the point where they tried to complain to Paige about it as if she could train him like a dog? They HATE energy drinks for the most asinine reasons.
[2:16:46] <%starotter70> @Urgotfantasy When are we not?
[2:16:48] <%SilvaChariot0133> Chat wants hentai pics
[2:16:54] <%vectorless_peon> you can take ALL their photos at the station
[2:16:56] <%Dementedpenguin> You know, if I came into this stream not knowing anything about Astral Chain, I would assume it was a photo game with the way people are screaming about it half the time LUL
[2:17:00] <SleepyMaribo> you can redo missions so it doesnt matter\
[2:17:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> as to the actual "prize" for taking the pics, they just unlock more photo filters
[2:17:03] <+McSoliace> ban all of us
[2:17:04] <+parrotman01> Energy Drinks taste nasty anyway
[2:17:08] <Fujiwara_92> DON'T LISTEN TO CHAT'S LIES! BASCH LIVES! SwiftRage

[2:17:15] <+TSmasher1000> @Dementedpenguin It might just be a photo game with STAND USERS Kappa
[2:17:15] <+VektorTroika> red matter, what is this, jjabrahmstrek?
[2:17:16] <asurite_warrior> @AngriestPat don't worry about it all it was was extra points for getting a picture of her being tentacled.
[2:17:18] <Admiral_PopnFresh> The police force, with the classic policing tool...the greatsword
[2:17:20] <ravencloak13> @rubberfistfight Didn’t he get gaut though?
[2:17:24] <%TweetHeart> which one of you degenerates likes hand holding?
[2:17:26] <%Dementedpenguin> @TSmasher1000 PogChamp
[2:17:28] <%RubberFistFight> @ravencloak13 not from energy drinks.
[2:17:31] <ravencloak13> And stuck shit?
[2:17:38] <jumad390> it's for a specific order, but it'ts just for a photo filter
[2:17:39] <%Laecerelius> Man all of this sticky, stinky tentacle goo
[2:17:39] <%Estuko> @TweetHeart in public or...
[2:17:40] <%Mekhet09> @rubberfistfight energy drinks are pretty bad for you but if pat wants to kill himself it's his right.
[2:17:40] <Pompadourius> keep the peace by slashing the crime
[2:17:46] <%RubberFistFight> @ravencloak13 also not from energy drinks.
[2:17:46] <jbrachob> look at the you orders, you HAVE to take some pictures at sertain moments of the game
[2:17:47] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Chat says don't listen to it. So do I listen or don't? NotLikeThis
[2:17:48] <%Louie_Salmon> Galaxy brain, none of this matters because the pictures just unlock more dumb filters and bios with filler lore
[2:17:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> Babel Chkn
[2:17:54] <Superbro64> @tweetheart do you wash your hands afterwards? doodSinwata
[2:17:59] <DevinMayCry> And cheivos
[2:18:07] <%starotter70> Nobody hates Chat more than Chat
[2:18:12] <+TSmasher1000> Man I never imagined Nintendo would put on Japan's most popular AV star in this game, tentacles Kreygasm
[2:18:13] <%Louie_Salmon> @devinmaycry Cheivos that give camera filters
[2:18:15] <%TweetHeart> must keep them clean
[2:18:15] <+The_Phantom_Theif> @Sphincter_Spelunker You can listen, but don't look at it.
[2:18:16] <@StridentSong> I think I hate Chat more then Chat.
[2:18:20] <%RubberFistFight> @Mekhet09 they're no worse for you than coffee, especially the sugarfree ones. It's OVERCONSUMPTION that's the issue but that's true for a whole bunch of shit, including but not limited to LITERALLY WATER.
[2:18:20] <%joylent_blue> Sphincter_Spelunker the 247th chat user is lying
[2:18:22] <DevinMayCry> The cheivo is what mattered
[2:18:25] <%Estuko> @StridentSong FeelsBadMan
[2:18:32] <ScreamLord> @StridentSong But you are Chat
[2:18:33] <+TSmasher1000> @StridentSong Impossible. You can't hate myself more than I already do Kappa
[2:18:43] <@StridentSong> I'm here cause I heard you were all being dirty degenerates. I'd advise against that in the future
[2:18:46] <+McSoliace> Why does it matter if pat misses anything. He's going to grind these stages later anyway
[2:18:50] <ravencloak13> Sugar free is worse out of anything. Diet anything is terrible.
[2:18:59] <ShichiNoBushi> Remember to come back to that door later.
[2:19:00] <Pompadourius> CRAZY TALK
[2:19:03] <+TSmasher1000> But that's like 99% of Twitch chat, filthy degenerates.
[2:19:04] <+TSmasher1000> Kappa
[2:19:06] <%RubberFistFight> @StridentSong when are they NOT?
[2:19:06] <%dekkitout> Timestop?
[2:19:09] <%Laecerelius> I guess you need PAUNCH!
[2:19:10] <Saltmeisterr> need ARMS
[2:19:11] <%chronotriggerhappy123> @AngriestPat yeah, if you get over 80% cleanup you complete the order for it and get material
[2:19:12] <chambatron> Arms
[2:19:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @StridentSong That's all the time, tho
[2:19:14] <ScreamLord> @Admiral_PopnFresh You need to get Big Meaty Arms first
[2:19:21] <Pompadourius> You need a forgettable Switch entry title to progress.
[2:19:22] <Cortana0452> How is it possible to not be a filthy degenerate
[2:19:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> after
[2:19:30] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat You need to get Big Meaty Arms first
[2:19:32] <%joylent_blue> 🤔
[2:19:32] <+bigboyeggo> GO DOWN FIRST
[2:19:33] <%Sh00s> Hey Pat, quick question: could you try to have the same exact gameplay experience as me? Thanks in advance! MiniK
[2:19:34] <+Slowpoking> You need a good angle to shoot the pod generating the mist
[2:19:38] <+smevvster> Music's boppin I dig this
[2:19:41] <ravencloak13> Oh look, swamp gas from Woolie’s swamp,
[2:19:42] <%Laecerelius> evil purple gas
[2:19:43] <%Mekhet09> @rubberfistfight the amount of water you's need to drink to cause issues is absurd and sugar free is worse. artificial sugars can cause problems all on their own.
[2:19:47] <Derkinstacker> Prepare for ORA ORA

[2:27:23] <%RubberFistFight> @Zaphire_Saucypants because they directly translated it instead of doing a proper localisation. Fun fact: Japanese sentence structure sounds awkward if it's not adjusted when translated into a language that works fundamentally differently.
[2:27:25] <%Louie_Salmon> Retroactive death flags, for people who have already died
[2:27:29] <+The_Phantom_Theif> Jin's VA has one foot out of the recording studio while doing this,

[2:28:23] <+TSmasher1000> So basically you realized he's a Joestar Kappa
[2:28:29] <+arancet> but the rabid dog is chained, that means its safe
[2:28:30] <%Estuko> @chronotriggerhappy123 it's a reward to others.

[2:32:43] <Pompadourius> Axe Legion reminds me of Izanagi in design tbh
[2:32:45] <alwayspronking> lappy special??
[2:32:49] <Caidezes> The obligatory Amaterasu stand-in is good too.
[2:32:50] <+bigboyeggo> i just tried to skip ahead LUL
[2:33:00] <LandOfTheWay> oh, can you give each legion a unique color?
[2:33:03] <al0nem0nster> what does this monster have as its specials, please tell me hadoken or something.
[2:33:06] <%Dr_DangerPhD> stack crit on punch legion to melt peeps when you ora ora
[2:33:07] <%chronotriggerhappy123> @xcompleasedad nope, but watching the first 2 videos would give context to the game if you dont plan on getting it
[2:33:16] <%Louie_Salmon> @bigboyeggo I've done that plenty of times
[2:33:17] <Soul_Intern> ohhhhh
[2:33:18] <%TweetHeart> he looks very happy with his new lot in life

[2:33:30] <xcompleasedad> @chronotriggerhappy123 Thanks for helping me out, LUL
[2:33:42] <tigerfang86> CLEARING THE AREA....
[2:33:42] <%NeroInfinite> spheree griiddsssss
[2:33:43] <Zombrocom> Man he is fucking pissed
[2:33:52] <al0nem0nster> @Pompadourius Yes, so may it launch a rocket from its hands like a hadouken for the hell of it.
[2:33:53] <%joylent_blue> dump those gene codes in his robot mouth
[2:33:55] <%TweetHeart> might have a cold
[2:33:55] <powerprotoman> now yuo can hit rush into hit rush into arm combos
[2:33:56] <Zombrocom> Arm Legion is not happy about slavery
[2:34:01] <%Laecerelius> There's gonna be legion goo on the floor once Pat's done leveling his new punch ghost up
[2:34:09] <%Louie_Salmon> I have found auto-bind to be straight up useless
[2:34:19] <Pompadourius> @al0nem0nster I think that is what its back forward is
[2:34:20] <+Jonesman64> perfect call and sync is always a wise investment
[2:34:25] <%decisivelynameless> Perfect Call + Sync is the coolest shit
[2:34:27] <%TweetHeart> but arm legion gets to have baby legs now
[2:34:28] <%joylent_blue> i like auto-bind....
[2:34:29] <Soul_Intern> BIG ATTACK
[2:34:34] <Soul_Intern> BIG SPEED
[2:34:34] <%chronotriggerhappy123> @powerprotoman even better, he can now use Unleash on 3 stands, he can have an all out legion free for all for 20 seconds
[2:34:36] <InvaderKAZ> @AngriestPat I dunno if you know this but during hit rush, you can change Legion and have two of them out at the same time for a bit
[2:34:37] <papershuriken_0> Auto binds pretty good imo
[2:34:41] <Derkinstacker> Auto bind is probably the most useful for slow moving stands.
[2:34:42] <transporterthesequel> YES SUPER ARMOR
[2:34:44] <%Laecerelius> Super armor omega
[2:34:44] <%starotter70> @joylent_blue same...
[2:34:50] <%Golinvoxx> super ar.our
[2:34:52] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> you cant have more than 2 stands out at a time unfortunately
[2:34:54] <%Laecerelius> Now that's an ability name
[2:34:54] <Soul_Intern> HMMMMMM
[2:34:54] <+emperri> super armor is 3 slots
[2:35:04] <%dekkitout> Alpha and Omege: Super Armour
[2:35:08] <transporterthesequel> Awwe boo
[2:35:14] <%decisivelynameless> Speed Boost on that fella is great
[2:35:17] <CleverUsername7777> Get a "Slow Attack" one to make it into The World.
[2:35:18] <%decisivelynameless> since he's a slow boy
[2:35:18] <+Jonesman64> perfect call e-heal is kind of useful
[2:35:19] <poweruser> gene code absorb...
[2:35:21] <al0nem0nster> considering you wear it movement boost may be the way to go
[2:35:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> guy is slower than the rest so speed boost is a must
[2:35:23] <Soul_Intern> BIG speed
[2:35:25] <+TSmasher1000> Do you guys think they made this game with stand users on purpose as a reference to Jojo? Kappa
[2:35:32] <Soul_Intern> YEYEYEYEYE
[2:35:37] <%Yadogari> Legion speed boost was literally under it
[2:35:37] <Soul_Intern> Aw
[2:35:41] <powerprotoman> legion speed boost is right there pat
[2:35:45] <%starotter70> I thought it was both?
[2:35:46] <%reonome> BLIND
[2:35:49] <%Laecerelius> Big crits!
[2:35:50] <%NeroInfinite> There was legion speed boost @AngriestPat

[2:36:02] <%Laecerelius> Don't forget the doors you can punch open or whatever
[2:36:06] <GeltonZ> @TSmasher1000 Life is just a Jojo reference.
[2:36:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you gotta fall dude.

[2:39:24] <deviljhojho94> damn right
[2:39:27] <StromkoPenguin> I hope when he tries to use the Arm Legion to blueshift a civilian it just crushes them into goo.

[2:42:59] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> you can also sometimes cheese an enemy by repeatedly grabbing it before it can attack
[2:43:05] <Pompadourius> Any advice for people playing this game: don't go on Gamefaqs. It's a shithole of trolls and degeneracy right now.
[2:43:09] <%Estuko> @Dakuu75 I know a Dexter thing, but I meant the singer lol

[2:47:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> other way I think
[2:47:23] <%shawntk_> @Jonesman64 Because Pat hasn't gotten to Beast Legion yet
[2:47:24] <%bakiinthedemon> With gun!

[2:47:38] <%joylent_blue> AlexDemille verdict is LOOK AT THAT SHIT every 30 seconds
[2:47:39] <%starotter70> That's not bad
[2:47:39] <darkdagon769> star platinum with a bit of emerald splash
[2:47:39] <%Estuko> It's a BIG O style but FAST

[2:48:06] <ravencloak13> Honestly it’s better Star Platinum cause it has guns and a black hole. Though Star Platinum could suck up people to with breathing.

[2:52:57] <%RubberFistFight> lol defibrillating someone who's in severe hypovolemic shock is UTTERLY FUCKING POINTLESS. The problem isn't an irregular heartbeat, it's the fact that there's not enough blood to pump LUL
[2:53:05] <Pompadourius> EVERYBODY EXCEPT THE PROTAGONIST IS A JOBBER
[2:53:06] <Jflaskd13> She's prolly part stand like you are

[2:53:25] <%wydamn> @RubberFistFight You don't understand. The twins are HIGHLY resilient.
[2:53:27] <%starotter70> @Zxtole It was either an article that I saw in passing or a Nintendo direct somewhere
[2:53:28] <tigerfang86> NO THANK YOU
[2:53:30] <%NeroInfinite> I haaate that
[2:53:32] <ObsidianDragon86> DONT LIKE THAT NOT A ONE BIT

[2:53:53] <%corepool> ugly and wiggly boy
[2:53:53] <%Estuko> monkaS
[2:53:54] <daisyyyy> @estuko yes
[2:53:56] <Zombrocom> So is dad or sis going to be red cop? Not sure now
[2:53:58] <%RubberFistFight> @AlexDemille eh, TV and movies have perpetuated the dumb notion that defibbing fixes everything. Additionally most people don't actually know what it does - nor do they care to educate themselves because being ignorant is easier.
[2:54:00] <%NeroInfinite> is this just a grosser venom?
[2:54:06] <%joylent_blue> fuck this thing ewwwwwwww
[2:54:10] <%wydamn> Watch for the xenomorph style split-face.
[2:54:13] <+bigboyeggo> SHIN GODZILLA TIME
[2:54:13] <%BubbaRands> How can less arms make you stronger? I never got that.
[2:54:19] <%floralkami> Ima guess that the sword she was stabbed with isnt actually physical, and thus won't give "real" damage
[2:54:19] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> lets see how long until he figures this out
[2:54:20] <+Jonesman64> by the way it has a laser
[2:54:26] <+TSmasher1000> Oh dammit is Pat going to die?
[2:54:26] <+emperri> LUL
[2:54:28] <Pompadourius> I still think dad is going to be red cop. They're building him up with backstory too much.
[2:54:29] <tigerfang86> what a hero
[2:54:30] <%joylent_blue> did you notice the laser, pat
[2:54:32] <+Zxtole> @starotter70 Again, story trailers/movie trailers/any trailers are designed to spoil shit because normal people like that. You shouldn't ever watch one if you want to go in blind
[2:54:33] <%GarbageNirvana> Are you doing a glados m8
[2:54:35] <%NeroInfinite> It's snake rules @BubbaRands
[2:54:35] <al0nem0nster> Either that or it's going to work like Dante's sword and give her super powers.
[2:54:36] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> WHAT A ATTACK
[2:54:39] <daisyyyy> hes fighting harder and more desperately
[2:54:40] <+AlexDemille> @RubberFistFight That's fair. It's also the idea that the hole + fall didn't kill her already.
[2:54:43] <%chronotriggerhappy123> his face
[2:54:43] <+VektorTroika> watch out for the lasers son
[2:54:46] <TheAsianAvenger96> of course, a cop beats a unarmed assailant to death
[2:54:46] <%chronotriggerhappy123> is a weakpoint
[2:54:49] <al0nem0nster> long range maybe?
[2:54:50] <%starotter70> @Zxtole Fair enough
[2:54:50] <%joylent_blue> its ok chat, he'll still get an S+
[2:54:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you have a gun

[2:55:20] <%ToadKing> or that i guess
[2:55:20] <+AlexDemille> Why would he use a gun when he has a sword!?
[2:55:21] <%chronotriggerhappy123> its fine
[2:55:22] <%BubbaRands> @NeroInfinite Arms on snakes would be a buff not a nerf!
[2:55:22] <+CaptainGrime> that works too
[2:55:24] <chambatron> BLIND
[2:55:24] <%Laecerelius> Man that thing sure can vomit lasers, can't it?
[2:55:25] <+donpatrondx> "this is my life now"

[2:55:26] <%Louie_Salmon> You never threw the sign
[2:55:26] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> that works too
[2:55:28] <%Estuko> that's a tongue alright
[2:55:32] <+TSmasher1000> This game kinda reminds me of a mix of Tokyo Ghoul and Jojo's LUL
[2:55:44] <Dr_Mooose> so this things mouth, has a mouth

[2:59:06] <%starotter70> @mayorrev He's actually been dubbing over Pat this whole time
[2:59:11] <ravencloak13> And we can survive jumping out of a helicopter 10 stores up!
[2:59:30] <%ElenaManetta> so in Japan, first day on the job as a cop is the most dangerous but in America, one day aware from retirement is the most dangerous
[2:59:31] <%ElenaManetta> I see
[2:59:51] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:53] <%starotter70> Aware huh?
[2:59:57] <%joylent_blue> can we talk about how fucking long the missions are in this game, i just did mission 6 and it took me like 4 hours
[2:59:58] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> huh, wonder if there is an article for both cop tropes on tvtropes
[3:00:09] <+TSmasher1000> @ElenaManetta Nah first day on the job in America you go to Raccoon city after being drunk the night before Kappa
[3:00:13] <%BubbaRands> I thought it was two weeks away from retirement
[3:00:20] <%dekkitout> Of course there's an article for that on TV tropes
[3:00:22] <UnfilteredComic> Did pat find the secret shop in file 3?
[3:00:31] <%floralkami> @ElenaManetta really, it's the arua of "Hope and fulfillment" that attracts attention

[3:03:37] <%joylent_blue> its the good kind of button mashing
[3:03:38] <%alcors_wisdom> you can not wear earplugs while diving or your ears will explode @AngriestPat
[3:03:41] <KaseKaizer> D:
[3:03:42] <%dekkitout> Who said that?!
[3:03:43] <Ion_Laser> I read that review. I mean...wow
[3:03:43] <Dr_Mooose> D:
[3:03:46] <+TheBitingIrish> PECK
[3:03:47] <ScreamLord> That can be said about most games

[3:03:54] <tigerfang86> DEMONETIZED
[3:03:54] <%joylent_blue> word
[3:03:55] <%Piemen99> pssf
[3:03:56] <%joylent_blue> fuck
[3:03:56] <Pompadourius> People who say button mashing are people who didn't get past file 3 or who played the game on casual mode.
[3:04:00] <@lewdskeletor13> You can’t say those worss
[3:04:00] <+TheBitingIrish> MYURRRDURR
[3:04:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> THIS IS A CHRISTIAN STREAM
[3:04:09] <%Maids4lyfe> not drowning? what next have to feed it too? DansGame
[3:04:18] <%joylent_blue> its like V but a LOT more engaging
[3:04:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> Stop Pecking Cursing you Peckneck bastards
[3:04:24] <@lewdskeletor13> a MYURRRRRRDUR? On MY OWL EXPRESS?
[3:04:26] <%dekkitout> Speaking of V- why isn't there a Griffin-like Legion tajCRY
[3:04:33] <Valdorick> All character action games are button mashes, its just the difference between a waltz and flailing around like a jackass.
[3:04:34] <zv1neda> PogChamp
[3:04:35] <%mastertwin2> You have control of the thing's movement
[3:04:38] <SleepyMaribo> the combat is simple for those who want to enjoy the game, but ive seen some combo videos already
[3:04:43] <+emperri> as I barack obama
[3:04:46] <InvaderKAZ> Honestly V didn't have many options
[3:04:50] <%joylent_blue> its like if you can control where Shadow moves, and you could do cool dual attacks with Shadow
[3:04:54] <zv1neda> mind goblins DansGame
[3:04:57] <%floralkami> @dekkitout isnt that Arrow Legion?
[3:05:10] <%arcaderabbit48> I genuinely do not, but I'm not the biggest fan of MonHun anyway so eh
[3:05:12] <%dekkitout> But it's not a bird....
[3:05:13] <@lewdskeletor13> Did he miss the pun again
[3:05:16] <daisyyyy> like, its Platinum lite, but that aint necessarily a bad thing
[3:05:25] <SovPho> guess i'll watch an angry caffeinated ginger talk about subs while i wait for my WoW queue
[3:05:31] <Erictron4000> Ill been reading iceborne leaks and it sounds really good
[3:05:33] <%ElenaManetta> pat's beard is getting thick
[3:05:35] <Warbot40> I have to catch up on PS4 version of MHW so I'm just gonna do the PC version of Iceborne
[3:05:35] <D3va> jesus man, everyone complains about stupid shit about cyberpunk. I really should avoid wasting time on twitter...
[3:05:37] <al0nem0nster> @Dekkitout well there is if you count the arrow legion, I mean they have one punch boy with lazers, one 4 legged beast, and one long range floaty one.
[3:05:38] <Valdorick> !uptime
[3:05:39] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 5m.
[3:05:41] <%joylent_blue> its ok, but could be streamlined
[3:05:44] <%starotter70> @daisyyyy It feels like Platinum the video game
[3:05:45] <+emperri> it seems not $250 cooler than just playing nier again
[3:05:47] <@lewdskeletor13> @elenamanetta Thicc you might say
[3:05:56] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Ability system is fun when you get that Hit Rush Unchain thing and it let's you have multiple Legions out at once
[3:06:02] <%ToadKing> chain jumps for days tho
[3:06:04] <%joylent_blue> i wanna do JUMP CANCELING
[3:06:05] <+Slowpoking> Chain jumps is your jump
[3:06:09] <daisyyyy> @starotter70 its Platinums Greatest Hits
[3:06:10] <%Maids4lyfe> wait there's no jump button?
[3:06:11] <%mastertwin2> You just need to buy Air Hike
[3:06:21] <%starotter70> @daisyyyy Platinum All Stars

[3:06:26] <daisyyyy> Featuring: 2B's Ass
[3:06:29] <Blank9> the only way damage counts is if you get no damage you get a big boost to points
[3:06:30] <zv1neda> damage WutFace
[3:06:32] <Roz_Lynd> man i wish damage didn't count in my day
[3:06:32] <+Slowpoking> The next stand you unlock also lets you jump
[3:06:36] <UnfilteredComic> I got a D on the final boss lmao
[3:06:39] <ShichiNoBushi> You also seem to get points for not using items or using items.
[3:06:43] <Valdorick> You just gotta style on your enemies, and its fine if your enemies style on you?
[3:06:44] <Blank9> but otherwise, taking 20 damage vs 2000 makes no difference
[3:06:47] <Roz_Lynd> memories of dante must die mode and not being able to take a single hit
[3:06:47] <+TheBitingIrish> LUL
[3:06:51] <%joylent_blue> apatGoblin
[3:06:53] <%floralkami> @D3va most likely people getting baited by bs headlines, like CYBERPUNK REMOVES GENDER OPTIONS, which really meant it was gonna be a body type selection instead.
[3:06:57] <Fujiwara_92> gemblin

[3:07:13] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 7m.
[3:07:14] <%wydamn> @Maids4lyfe yeah, no jump just dodge and chain jumps for some weird platforming sections
[3:07:22] <%worldbrand> there's one in the intro under a cop car lol
[3:07:22] <%arancet> arancet subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! been replaying zelda botw with dlc for first time since release and loving it as much as the first time, but goddamn the master sword trials are unbalanced in hard mode
[3:07:24] <%starotter70> It's sneaky
[3:07:32] <@lewdskeletor13> Pretty sneaky cat
[3:07:36] <KaseKaizer> @AngriestPat wasn't the cat in file 2 under that dumpster?
[3:07:39] <Pompadourius> You found the cat in file 2. It was in the dumpster but you needed the Arm Legion for it. @AngriestPat
[3:07:41] <%joylent_blue> oh damn
[3:07:43] <zv1neda> PogChamp
[3:07:45] <%Maids4lyfe> @wydamn that's a weird design choice
[3:07:45] <%worldbrand> Oh yeah the master sword trials in master mode are horseshit
[3:07:50] <Fujiwara_92> damn roz
[3:07:51] <Roz_Lynd> EITHER WAY

[3:08:10] <+TSmasher1000> BotW Kreygasm
[3:08:11] <@lewdskeletor13> He’s gonna spend it all on loot boxes and stream it
[3:08:13] <+Gr33nCutl4ss> closet deserts
[3:08:18] <D3va> @floralkami that, but also that they hust think CDPR is making the game just for them. Now people complain for no third person cutscenes....
[3:08:19] <Roz_Lynd> AWH H HAHAHAAHAAAAA
[3:08:20] <Tucker0603> lol
[3:08:21] <%joylent_blue> i did the story DLC in BOTW, was underwhelmed, and then didn't do the other DLC

[3:08:36] <Thepothero> Rip
[3:08:37] <DarbyV> pat did an oopsie LUL
[3:08:37] <%GarbageNirvana> Hopefully Shadowkeep cuts shit like that down
[3:08:42] <Roz_Lynd> very last week
[3:08:43] <+emperri> boy does all the missable shit make me glad I never got into destiny
[3:08:44] <Pompadourius> The Master Sword upgrade DLC in BoTW was SO satisfying to beat.
[3:08:44] <%Piemen99> ye
[3:08:44] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[3:08:44] <+Arcaenum> There's one more iron banner this season i believe, since shadowkeep got delayed
[3:08:44] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat working on my redrix's Broadsword
[3:08:45] <%Maids4lyfe> one more
[3:08:47] <%dekkitout> Isn't there gonna be another IB, or was this one the another one
[3:08:48] <Tucker0603> yes
[3:08:50] <Thepothero> I got both shaders
[3:08:54] <KaliasTV> You can get them as random or token drops next one
[3:08:57] <%d00msdaydan> we got another one because they pushed shadowkeep back
[3:09:00] <NiktenKing> Yes because of the delay
[3:09:00] <%Ninestempest> pvp thing
[3:09:02] <tragicjohnson84> Pat., Astral Chain is great, I've been playing it all day
[3:09:04] <%Reaviar> its a pulse firle
[3:09:04] <%Piemen99> pvp gun
[3:09:07] <%Maids4lyfe> it's a pulse rifle from pvp
[3:09:07] <%NeroInfinite> it's apvp sword
[3:09:08] <%Reaviar> rifle*
[3:09:09] <+cunningchaff> Pulse rifle at the end of a long pvp quest chain
[3:09:12] <Roz_Lynd> it's a pulse rifle that demands you reset your rank like fuckin 3 times?
[3:09:12] <%d00msdaydan> it's redrix's broadsword it super peeves me off that people leave out the 's
[3:09:13] <NiktenKing> They delayed the Shadowkeep release a could weeks
[3:09:17] <Tucker0603> pinnacle PvP weapon
[3:09:17] <chambatron> A great weapona lready masterworked
[3:09:19] <startstoprepeat> grind made manifest
[3:09:19] <%dekkitout> It's a pulserifle that fires faster if you get headshots
[3:09:19] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat It was a super good Pulse Rifle
[3:09:21] <NiktenKing> couple*
[3:09:33] <Thepothero> @angriestpat pvp weapon
[3:09:43] <Thepothero> It’s really good
[3:09:55] <Tucker0603> it's a LOOOOOONG grind @angriestpat
[3:09:57] <%Ninestempest> it's a pretty absurd grind but yes, not impossible
[3:10:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat HEy Pat and Chat I got D2 on my blizzard account. Is there any benifit to starting on there before the F2P kicks in or would I just get nothing for it
[3:10:03] <Roz_Lynd> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[3:10:05] <anuchallengertwitch> is the stream over?
[3:10:05] <Roz_Lynd> they might!
[3:10:06] <%Piemen99> I did it without knowing it
[3:10:11] <Roz_Lynd> we had a year 1 fest all this season
[3:10:11] <%Ninestempest> iron banner had unique shaders every time??
[3:10:15] <%joylent_blue> nothing's impossible with the power of no-lifing
[3:10:15] <Pompadourius> @anuchallengertwitch Nope
[3:10:16] <startstoprepeat> they're all p ugly
[3:10:18] <+Arcaenum> Most of those shaders are ugly anyway
[3:10:20] <blackwolfx2099> are you ever gonna play dead space one on stream?
[3:10:22] <Thepothero> Like shred full armor titans good
[3:10:27] <%dekkitout> The old Iron Banner ornaments were where it's at
[3:10:35] <NiktenKing> Iron banner had unique armor ornaments, but not so much shaders I believe
[3:10:38] <Roz_Lynd> probably archived
[3:10:41] <%dekkitout> Both?
[3:10:46] <+Arcaenum> Probably gone? Maybe?
[3:10:50] <daisyyyy> its goin f2p i bet itll all show up in the store
[3:10:55] <Tucker0603> archived for later probably
[3:11:02] <+emperri> is there a game to go with any of this or is it literally just a neverending FOMO checklist
[3:11:03] <Roz_Lynd> one thing i love me my claws of the wolf
[3:11:03] <NiktenKing> You can't get those for now... unless they do reruns for the new people
[3:11:04] <D3va> is destiny 2 worth giving it a try?
[3:11:04] <Roz_Lynd> <3
[3:11:05] <%dekkitout> Faction Rally ornaments tajCRY
[3:11:08] <Roz_Lynd> my favorite gun
[3:11:08] <+Arcaenum> That's fair
[3:11:09] <anuchallengertwitch> How's everyone liking the game so far?
[3:11:16] <Thepothero> But yeah go for what ever pinicle weapon you want

[3:43:35] <KaliasTV> One guy
[3:43:36] <+inkboySP> it's so clean on each Legion. it's like the artists designed the color scheme as EVA first, then made cop colors after that

[3:45:03] <Valdorick> Unlimited Combo Works!
[3:45:06] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> it's so hard to get the whole thing off when shit's going nuts

[3:45:17] <HentaiSpyder> just raised a Chikorita to lvl 50 in Pokemon Crystal to get solarbeam. but it's a shit move so I didn't learn it.
[3:45:17] <tigerfang86> HELL YES
[3:45:17] <Derkinstacker> try with arm man.

[3:45:38] <Valdorick> Li Feng is 1000% dead
[3:45:49] <Blank9> they may have followups on the gun + arrow 360
[3:45:52] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Li Fang doing squats while you're flipping about like a crazy person.
[3:45:53] <%Keyd00d> eh
[3:45:53] <Blank9> you never know
[3:46:00] <%dekkitout> Mix that shit with Punch boi's graviton for the big potg
[3:46:02] <InvaderKAZ> The 360 synch attack with Sword is amazing
[3:46:03] <%starotter70> @AngriestPat Try moving the arm one during the spin
[3:46:06] <%joylent_blue> i always forget about the command moves FeelsBadMan
[3:46:07] <+inkboySP> it's so unnecessarily amazing. I can see why some people got so worked up over exclusivity
[3:46:07] <Onmi_Khaos> Let's Muda some Dora's
[3:46:07] <mayorrev> awwww
[3:46:11] <+DingusMcFadden> It needs orange high-lights. It's not Unit 01 enough
[3:46:16] <%Chichen> try gun
[3:46:17] <doggieo> Different weapon?
[3:46:18] <+Jonesman64> try different weapons
[3:46:23] <Datsanegg> Guess it your "main" one that gets heavy combo potential
[3:46:27] <InvaderKAZ> IT DOES, THE 360 FOR SWORD IS A SUPER LONG COMBO
[3:46:28] <%starotter70> Maybe not?
[3:46:36] <%goose_attack_almanac> Arm Legion apparently has snatch?
[3:46:37] <Blank9> gun + arms has a followup I think
[3:46:41] <TheDr0t> pincer blade?
[3:46:45] <%starotter70> oh?

[3:47:06] <Valdorick> Ya gotta spin it to win it
[3:47:06] <Baconrath> LETS BEYBLAAAAADE
[3:47:08] <anuchallengertwitch> Down an out
[3:47:09] <UnfilteredComic> then you can move it around
[3:47:09] <%dekkitout> I demand maximum spin
[3:47:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> Roundtrip but with you STAND
[3:47:12] <%ElenaManetta> Literally "I'll try spinning, that's a good trick"
[3:47:13] <@commanderclaw> What about holding the bow one?
[3:47:14] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> can you then chain jump too damn
[3:47:16] <+allups> i don't really like the station music
[3:47:28] <implied_consent> I do
[3:47:29] <+inkboySP> Hello, welcome to Astral Chain, where my Star Platinum is also a Beyblade
[3:47:29] <mayorrev> Speen
[3:47:30] <Onmi_Khaos> This feels really Transformers Devastation
[3:47:32] <%dekkitout> Yet?
[3:47:34] <+ProtagonistJake> @allups then perish
[3:47:35] <%kyh9> Lappy looks so sad when you dont want to try his training programs
[3:47:37] <Onmi_Khaos> With all the Flash-Actions
[3:47:37] <HentaiSpyder> surprised Lappy doesn't have the Platinum Star on her cap.
[3:47:38] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> If you get hit by this, it's your own fault
[3:47:39] <%joylent_blue> allups excuse me that's illegal
[3:47:39] <anuchallengertwitch> "I'm gonna spin around, and if you get hit, it's you're own fault"
[3:47:46] <DatAsuna> it plays way better than devastation
[3:47:53] <+inkboySP> Bart Platinum
[3:47:56] <Onmi_Khaos> I say Devastation as a good thing
[3:47:58] <Onmi_Khaos> I loved that game
[3:48:00] <+ATentacleMonster> Training AI is ruthless LUL
[3:48:01] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> Star Platinum? More like Dual wield Silver Chariot
[3:48:02] <djipp97> You can check combos in the help menu, just FYI
[3:48:04] <Onmi_Khaos> I SS ranked that game on Magnus
[3:48:11] <+allups> LUL
[3:48:12] <%joylent_blue> JESUS
[3:48:12] <%starotter70> Nice
[3:48:12] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> yeah @Onmi_Khaos I felt it a lot like Devestation whenever I used Arrow Legion, and the sync attacks spark just like the transform moves in that
[3:48:16] <vexion_smh> JESUS
[3:48:16] <SulfurousAcid> Pat's favorite enemy
[3:48:17] <DatAsuna> Korra best of the one year P+ games
[3:48:17] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @jetstreamlover_ryocan so Anubis Chariot
[3:48:22] <DevinMayCry> this game is really good with HUD off. Just tried it.
[3:48:29] <%dekkitout> Fight big punch with big punch- of course!
[3:48:44] <DevinMayCry> Everything vital you need to know has a visual equivelent on your character
[3:48:45] <%starotter70> I like that it swings YOU around a bit
[3:48:47] <anuchallengertwitch> Devestation is/was hella underrated.
[3:48:51] <%joylent_blue> PogChamp //
[3:48:53] <%Louie_Salmon> @datasuna That's a really random comment but definitely yes
[3:48:54] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Arm has I think a long standard gun string
[3:49:07] <SulfurousAcid> D
[3:49:07] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> @sphincter_spelunker Basically except the part of trying to kill you LUL
[3:49:08] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> since he is kinda the alternative ranged type weirdly enough
[3:49:14] <Onmi_Khaos> Just remember whenever anyone shit talks Transformers Devastation that you could give Megatron a Piledriver
[3:49:18] <%Chichen> has he done the LB moveset yet?
[3:49:27] <%arcaderabbit48> This guy seems really strong. And he isn't even that slow either
[3:49:35] <ihatepersona345> I read Taro's new game could be revealed later this year is that true?
[3:49:41] <DatAsuna> my main beef wih devastation was the game was spread too thin among too many characters
[3:49:43] <%joylent_blue> god it does the animation for Saix's yaoi paddle attack
[3:49:50] <+MegaMillenniumX> gun and arm has a nice standard sync
[3:49:55] <+emperri> taro's new game is called the next 24 man raid in FF14
[3:50:05] <%bloodxletter> bloodxletter subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:50:06] <DatAsuna> I'd much rather have had 2/3 transformers with more move, cause each individual one felt gimped
[3:50:08] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> ARM LEGION suit has a dodge counter
[3:50:11] <%starotter70> @joylent_blue That's the first time I've heard it called that and I hate it
[3:50:17] <pi_in_the_sci> Have you noticed that ARMS picks up small enemies and brings them to you if you just send him at an enemy
[3:50:25] <anuchallengertwitch> Optimus Prime was really Savage in Devestation too. "Megatron was right. You really are useless Starscream."
[3:50:30] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> Imagine a powered up version of this Gorilla version. it be freaking Rage from DMC5
[3:50:31] <%joylent_blue> starotter70 i'm glad i could get someone with that
[3:50:33] <jcflyguy> @pi_in_the_sci It's how I kill the slimes
[3:50:35] <SulfurousAcid> Just Do
[3:50:46] <Pompadourius> You gotta chain jump the ground slams
[3:50:48] <%starotter70> @joylent_blue apatFist
[3:50:48] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> charge shot is fun with arm
[3:50:49] <pi_in_the_sci> That'[s actually genius, thanks
[3:50:58] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> he just brings a bigger gun for your gun
[3:51:03] <Onmi_Khaos> But yeah this game is an evolution of Platinum games. I can see the Wonderful 101 here, I can see the T:D, I can see the Revengance
[3:51:03] <jcflyguy> It stuns them for a few seconds too
[3:51:07] <exileshadow03> Pat youre dodging that ground slam too early.
[3:51:18] <Onmi_Khaos> I don't... know if there's Bayonetta in these genes
[3:51:24] <anuchallengertwitch> Yeah, Invasion of privacy. Videogames.

[3:56:21] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> NOT UMBRELLA CORPS place
[3:56:22] <tigerfang86> the most EVIL TECHNOLOGY
[3:56:23] <+Snorlax321> M O S T
[3:56:23] <anuchallengertwitch> Red flags to always question in fiction, "You have nothing to worry about"
[3:56:26] <Onmi_Khaos> I'm not
[3:56:28] <Pompadourius> Did they elaborate on whether Sword Legion's blueshift ability ACTUALLY cures redshift, or just suppresses it to be non-fatal for a bit?
[3:56:28] <Marpolo13> advanced EVIL TECH
[3:56:34] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Doesn't that include future history? Lies
[3:56:35] <Dr_Mooose> yet
[3:56:35] <%mankeyfigh> USE ARI
[3:56:37] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Shouldn't they have a Medic using a Legion just going around curing redshift all the time. Like a noncombatant.
[3:56:38] <+temporal_zenith> A character named Akira in a lab with dangerous supernatural stuff...
[3:56:41] <%Keyd00d> You'll see them
[3:56:42] <vexion_smh> Fortress of lies intensifies
[3:56:42] <castlerock42> There is no way this is going to end well.

[3:56:43] <+shaderichter_belmont> so is papa Max dead, I doubt he'd let her be locked here

[3:57:08] <%kyh9> Wow, Brenda is stacked
[3:57:09] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> what about orphans
[3:57:10] <%Yadogari> Now take your medicine Pat
[3:57:12] <Blank9> I don't even know if blueshift is 100% healing it
[3:57:12] <%goose_attack_almanac> oh god it shows you the sizes
[3:57:14] <%AlexDemille> How can the cops not do something knowing what they know with their Iris?
[3:57:14] <%starotter70> Size is now unlocked
[3:57:15] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Look Pat, it's just like the Gene Clinics in XCOM 2. If you can't trust Advent, who can you trust?
[3:57:17] <Charlie99993> Also yeah, there's no reason to think blueshift isn't completely curing them
[3:57:17] <zv1neda> STACKED
[3:57:17] <%ElenaManetta> Maybe your Legion turned your powers off so you won't embarrass the doctors by healing all their patients
[3:57:18] <Blank9> just stopping a flare-up
[3:57:19] <+Jonesman64> oolooksickpeople
[3:57:22] <papershuriken_0> It’s not just redshift pat
[3:57:22] <Marpolo13> I'd be more of a plot twitst to me if these people DON'T turn out to be evil LUL

[3:57:52] <Soul_Intern> I WILL FIX THESE SPAGHETTI PEOPLE
[3:57:53] <Monkeyweed21> Do not compromise the tests
[3:57:54] <haveswordmuststing> its more profitable to treat Redshift than cure it
[3:57:54] <Pompadourius> I don't think blueshift ACTUALLY cures, but just suppresses the pain for a while.
[3:57:57] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat so what should the people without Legions do? Just wait for the 4 or 5 people who have Legions to just come by?

[3:58:45] <Charlie99993> @Pompadourius Nothing implies that though, blueshift kills all the red just like they can vacuum up the red junk on the floor like it's nothing.
[3:58:46] <Marpolo13> "NO DOUBT"

[4:13:34] <Caidezes> The twins are just Adam Jensen.
[4:13:38] <+ProtagonistJake> I’m guessing Jenna is our mom and her and Yoseph did some literally fucky experiments to make us
[4:13:42] <+C24U> Pee is stored in the phone
[4:13:44] <%starotter70> cause they seem like it

[4:19:33] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> but the drone exploded so meh

[4:26:21] <%Chichen> yep
[4:26:33] <%starotter70> "Nah fuck you, later"
[4:26:37] <%ElenaManetta> Thats just Metroid gameplay design, isn't it?
[4:26:45] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Why aren't there more cops with Stands?
[4:26:48] <%starotter70> Nice
[4:26:49] <%joylent_blue> fucking SAVED
[4:26:53] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I find "come back later" doors a little annoying
[4:26:54] <daisyyyy> lol
[4:26:58] <Torruun> You dope. LUL
[4:27:01] <%ElenaManetta> Introduce area, "you can't access this part yet"
[4:27:03] <daisyyyy> i did the same thing
[4:27:06] <tigerfang86> they ALL DIED
[4:27:06] <tank7013> @doc_ock_rokc Yea ok I could see a dippin dots machine being a thing
[4:27:11] <Marpolo13> the "chosen one" if you will
[4:27:17] <%dekkitout> There were 5, stands don't come cheap, gotta catch them all
[4:27:18] <chambatron> Scort mission!
[4:27:18] <KaliasTV> Since you can't play PT Ultimate the first time it's nice to have something extra to do
[4:27:18] <ShichiNoBushi> And you progessively gett all their old stands.
[4:27:29] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @ScreamLord There was also a building that was trying to make more, but then it got blown up and set back by months
[4:27:31] <%alexandrecau> yelluw
[4:27:33] <anuchallengertwitch> quick question, can you customize skin tone, or is it only hair, clothes, and legion color
[4:27:44] <Torruun> You can do skin tone anuchallengertwitch
[4:27:45] <%joylent_blue> anuchallengertwitch you can customize skin tone
[4:27:46] <+CCCPKi> you can
[4:27:58] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat I meant like a LOT more cops with Stands. 5 seems pathetic considering they have to defend an entire island nation
[4:28:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> @tank7013 when malls used to be a thing there was a ton of cool vending machines
[4:28:07] <%joylent_blue> oh that reminds me i unlocked a new skin tone and hair color
[4:28:10] <ScreamLord> @Sphincter_Spelunker Oh
[4:28:30] <%Scrub_Seeker> @joylent_blue wait, you UNLOCKED a skin tone?
[4:28:33] <daisyyyy> its suprisingly indepth customization. platinum knows we like playing dressup
[4:28:41] <%InugamiTheHound> IRIS is like assassin's creed "eagle vision"
[4:28:45] <+MrWrann> 5 stand users seems like more than enough
[4:28:46] <+JacktheMan18> Based on the game's opening sequence, making legions isn't super easy
[4:28:50] <anuchallengertwitch> @Torruun @joylent_blue cool. Thanks.
[4:28:56] <%Capta1n_H3nry> No uh, no jump, huh?
[4:28:57] <%shawntk_> @Scrub_Seeker I don't remember how but I unlocked like a literally rainbow of color options for skin colors
[4:29:04] <%joylent_blue> Scrub_Seeker i think thats what it was ye
[4:29:05] <%Laecerelius> Nope, no jump in this game
[4:29:06] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @ScreamLord Every one in Neuron was pretty much a candidate that has "the potential"
[4:29:09] <+hudalive> wow this game looks awesome
[4:29:13] <%Scrub_Seeker> that's dumb i love it
[4:29:14] <%king_wragles> This sound track is pretty good.
[4:29:15] <daisyyyy> @jacktheman18 like how expensive is it to replace that glass every time?
[4:29:15] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Well that's a damn shame
[4:29:16] <%joylent_blue> shawntk_ the fuck LUL
[4:29:26] <+JacktheMan18> LUL
[4:29:32] <Conky89> One thing that most videogame protagonists have in common is that they are not picky about their fashion sense
[4:29:36] <+JacktheMan18> that
[4:29:40] <+JacktheMan18> that's true
[4:29:56] <ScreamLord> Y'know, I kinda wish Scryed got a game. That was a pretty cool anime iirc
[4:29:58] <%king_wragles> Why are the LASERS on the train?
[4:30:01] <%joylent_blue> ...yeahh... safe....
[4:30:15] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> use your stand to press a button
[4:30:16] <+hypergenn2> wouldnt giving spare masks totally be thing?
[4:30:17] <anuchallengertwitch> @king_wragles Because Video Games
[4:30:20] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> alrighty
[4:30:31] <%Laecerelius> puse punch!
[4:30:37] <%Laecerelius> PAWNCH!
[4:30:38] <SulfurousAcid> maybe sword
[4:30:48] <daisyyyy> oh yeah and some bitch Stole the stuff they needed to make more
[4:30:49] <ToastedAeolo> ... yeah this doesn't look fun to play
[4:31:03] <implied_consent> I used to be subscribed to the official US PlayStation magazine for years.
[4:31:03] <ToastedAeolo> this part specifically anyways
[4:31:08] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> (he could just set him down...)
[4:31:11] <KatabolicRage> thats because pat is micromanaging instead of just letting his stand kill the thing
[4:31:15] <Meekest> How heavy is this lady
[4:31:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> Stan the stand!
[4:31:33] <KaliasTV> Arm legion is picking them up and dropping them next to you LUL
[4:31:37] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Why can't your stand just carry her and you do the fighting?
[4:31:38] <%joylent_blue> oh you can just set the person down LUL didn't realize
[4:31:41] <daisyyyy> this sequence aint bad. i dropped her like 3 times and it didnt care
[4:31:42] <anuchallengertwitch> Wow, This Music is totally Transformers Devastation
[4:31:45] <Pandapanda92> this looks kinda basic
[4:31:50] <chambatron> You can drop the dude?
[4:31:58] <chambatron> I didn't know that
[4:32:10] <+hypergenn2> honestly you should be fireman carrying her or making your stand do it xD
[4:32:16] <daisyyyy> i did it by accident all three times!
[4:32:17] <%Estuko> why not use your Hulk Hands stand to toss the civilians to safety?
[4:32:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> He lady, have you seen my "coming to a stop from a full run" pose?
[4:32:20] <artificiallynatural> sword trivializes those guys too. Arm's too slow
[4:32:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> What if someone just named their stand something common like howard
[4:32:30] <%king_wragles> @Pandapanda92 it has its moments, but it's one of those games that is as complex as you make it iirc
[4:32:35] <%Laecerelius> I'm sure punch stand could've held her in one arm and punched enemies to death with the other
[4:32:37] <%Urgotfantasy> Legions are kinda top secret so we probably shouldnt have civilians just floating around
[4:32:40] <KatabolicRage> yeah when I did this I just summoned my sword bro and just let it kill them all on it's own
[4:32:45] <Pandapanda92> has pat gained more mass
[4:32:48] <%starotter70> Yeah?
[4:32:49] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Nier 3
[4:33:00] <daisyyyy> @urgotfantasy literally who would believe them
[4:33:07] <%Estuko> @doc_ock_rokc like Howard Hewett?
[4:33:07] <%Urgotfantasy> True
[4:33:08] <Soul_Intern> NO YOU CANT
[4:33:11] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Viddy games
[4:33:13] <%Stratiotai2> Stratiotai2 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[4:33:16] <Soul_Intern> YOU CANT VAULT YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED
[4:33:22] <ScatterCatt> Why doesn't Pat break that wall open?
[4:33:23] <Marpolo13> no you gotta DO THE THING
[4:33:27] <%dekkitout> Must be this cool to vault
[4:33:27] <Pompadourius> Vaulting is against the law
[4:33:38] <ScreamLord> Cursed, my only weakness! Chest High Walls!
[4:33:47] <SulfurousAcid> no jampy time for you
[4:34:00] <artificiallynatural> It's so annoying that you can't climb a ledge
[4:34:11] <artificiallynatural> JUST VAULT UP
[4:34:15] <%dekkitout> Says everyone who's played a pokemon game
[4:34:16] <+hypergenn2> vaulting is for winners only
[4:34:19] <%king_wragles> Doesn't Pat want to take a picture of the vending machines? Why does he stop when he gets them in frame?
[4:34:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> Vault up stupid
[4:34:33] <KaliasTV> Jumping is outlawed
[4:34:36] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Parkour is forbidden
[4:34:37] <Torruun> Ah yes. Another protagonist that is defeated by waist-high walls.
[4:34:38] <daisyyyy> this game is good but its still got that platinum jank
[4:34:41] <Marpolo13> GOOOOOOOO

[4:34:50] <Soul_Intern> CUTE FROGGO
[4:34:50] <%joylent_blue> king_wragles if he needs to take their picture, orange ???? marks will appear below them when they're in frame
[4:34:51] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @dekkitout I can literally fly all over the region, why can't they just fly me over the small ledge
[4:34:52] <%starotter70> Gamer Goo Strikes again
[4:34:53] <%dekkitout> They're kinda cute
[4:34:54] <daisyyyy> i like jank so it aint a proble.
[4:34:54] <+JavaManJoJo> Man it felt like I was putting in so much time yet Pat is almost caught up. The missions in this game feel so long, but I like it.
[4:34:55] <Conky89> Gooey frogs HALP
[4:34:55] <+hypergenn2> ZEUS
[4:34:55] <Soul_Intern> ZEUS????

[4:34:57] <lemon_lore> cat?
[4:34:58] <Zombrocom> ....Zeus? A goo frog?

[4:35:12] <tigerfang86> MASSIVE SLAPS
[4:35:17] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> look like pre evolution digimon
[4:35:18] <Dr_Mooose> woah
[4:35:20] <Zombrocom> "They look like monsters to you?"
[4:35:21] <%joylent_blue> JUST LIKE HUMANS
[4:35:25] <jetstreamlover_ryocan> Does are digimon

[4:35:32] <Monkeyweed21> THEY HAVE 2 EYES AND A MOUTH
[4:35:32] <ScreamLord> They don't even have lightning powers!
[4:35:33] <pillowwasp> ARE THOSE HUMANS?
[4:35:43] <%joylent_blue> THIS ISN'T JUST A WORLD WAR
[4:35:51] <%joylent_blue> THIS IS A
[4:35:52] <+MrWrann> No legs, can't be like humans
[4:35:55] <implied_consent> Yeah Zeus isn't an apt name for these.
[4:35:57] <%joylent_blue> SPACE WAR!
[4:35:58] <artificiallynatural> SPACE WAR
[4:36:00] <%dekkitout> I'm sure there's some lore or Engrish pun that justifies their name/design
[4:36:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> Those look just like....CATS
[4:36:03] <%Keyd00d> IT'S A CAT
[4:36:19] <%Scrub_Seeker> they make... sheep noises?
[4:36:26] <Torruun> I'd say they look more like salamanders
[4:36:27] <%starotter70> They have arms!
[4:36:28] <SulfurousAcid> CATS
[4:36:30] <pillowwasp> WHAT! THEY LOOK JUST LIKE CATS
[4:36:34] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Zeurs turned into a frog to fuck someone at some point, I'm sure
[4:36:39] <%Laecerelius> Okay, so I'm not the only one who thinks that they sound like sheep when they're hit
[4:36:41] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Zeus*
[4:36:57] <Valdorick> GG fucker
[4:36:58] <%joylent_blue> good job sword
[4:37:00] <daisyyyy> Zeus probably just fucked wla frog
[4:37:08] <daisyyyy> *a frog
[4:37:10] <laserbeaming> How much control do you have over the Stand Thing?
[4:37:12] <%dekkitout> I can only imagine Zeus fucking a frog- as a goose
[4:37:15] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> pat should turn on co-op and have paige be his stand
[4:37:24] <Valdorick> But then wouldn't it be named Hercules
[4:37:26] <%InugamiTheHound> frog=cat
[4:37:28] <Marpolo13> no legion = useless now LUL
[4:37:32] <%joylent_blue> laserbeaming you can control where its movement, and when it attacks
[4:37:32] <artificiallynatural> and let Paige control the camera?
[4:37:37] <+MrWrann> Code 3 response needed
[4:37:40] <%king_wragles> Yes sergeant tsundere
[4:37:49] <%joylent_blue> control its movement*
[4:37:51] <Pompadourius> GOD, the other "veteran" cops are such jobbers. Even when they had Legions.
[4:37:51] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Go save your mom
[4:37:53] <ScreamLord> A monster that looks like little rabbit. "Oh God! A Hydra!"
[4:37:57] <%Chichen> yes
[4:37:57] <+Snorlax321> I'm sure she's fine
[4:37:59] <%starotter70> Yup

[4:38:21] <sonicblade38> zandastu
[4:38:23] <Valdorick> Its fine, what are the odds there's permadeath?
[4:38:25] <Estef7> Wow, someone actually using the boy and not the hot sister
[4:38:26] <doggieo> I got lost here
[4:38:32] <%starotter70> Just your average train safety lasers

[4:38:40] <Pompadourius> Go FUCK the woman that fucked your dad
[4:39:00] <Valdorick> wow, this place is all kinds of fucked, huh?
[4:39:01] <%ElenaManetta> WOW! Spyro unlocked on Switch at midnight. I didn't think they would do it for Spyro. There goes my stream watching.
[4:39:03] <%Urgotfantasy> She probably never fucked your dad
[4:39:05] <%Urgotfantasy> but boy she tried
[4:39:06] <DSD24> @Estef7 The Sister has a cute voice anyway
[4:39:10] <anuchallengertwitch> Hurry Pat ! Go save you Mo- I mean superior officer.

[4:39:31] <Valdorick> I mean, do you blame 'em?
[4:39:35] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @alexandrecau even Lappy? D:
[4:39:37] <%dekkitout> The sister's cooler as the hard ass sibling
[4:39:37] <%alexandrecau> like the whole precinct before you show up with your sister
[4:39:44] <%InugamiTheHound> red ice from Detroit become human?
[4:39:47] <%Urgotfantasy> Dad's a total hunk I cant blame literally everyone for wanting a piece
[4:39:49] <moosemonkey397> I accidentally gave the sister the same haircut as the boy. cutscenes are awkward
[4:39:51] <Valdorick> @Sphincter_Spelunker Lappy FUCKS.
[4:39:52] <+JacktheMan18> Gotta get the red stuff before I help my partner
[4:39:57] <daisyyyy> my BIGGEST complaint about the game is i picked the girl but i gotta listen to the guy
[4:39:59] <%joylent_blue> he's got those sexy eye scars
[4:40:02] <%king_wragles> @InugamiTheHound it's koopie krystals!
[4:40:04] <anuchallengertwitch> @Sphincter_Spelunker Especially Lappy,

[4:41:36] <%sjay449> Gavins cat
[4:41:39] <+Walopoh> I LOVE CAT COLLECTIBLES
[4:41:46] <%Keyd00d> they're so far
[4:41:52] <%Bad1uck> "you people"
[4:41:54] <+cafefunk> Hows the game so far, Pat?
[4:41:55] <%Keyd00d> no you didn't open those yet
[4:41:56] <Valdorick> Fancy Loadscreens?
[4:41:56] <Pompadourius> Only one Peter Pan reference in the chat? C'mon guys, I'm disappointed.
[4:42:00] <%starotter70> You did it
[4:42:03] <%joylent_blue> album full FeelsGoodMan
[4:42:06] <Valdorick> Oh no wait, yeah, he didn't open 'em
[4:42:27] <FalseEyeD> Get your ass over here Smee!
[4:42:27] <cielrayze> its ok you still got the data even when the album is full
[4:42:40] <DSD24> You forgot to get your ear plugs for roaring
[4:42:48] <%dekkitout> I hope the bork Legion's moveset is just these enemies on roids
[4:42:50] <%worldbrand> are enemy flashes indicative of anything other than an incoming attack?
[4:43:09] <%kyh9> eat limit-charge items for better recovery
[4:43:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> I wonder who's stand we are getting next
[4:43:10] <+Clik404> @worldbrand nah, not that I’ve noticed
[4:43:23] <DevinMayCry> Blue flashes are for your incoming attacks
[4:43:27] <%worldbrand> i guess it's just there because those attacks are fast
[4:43:35] <DevinMayCry> As in a tell for you to attack I mean
[4:43:40] <Pompadourius> Pretty sure red means it's the point at which the red strand shows up for Zandatsu.
[4:43:41] <NiktenKing> probably doggo
[4:43:45] <+Clik404> @worldbrand It’s a Platinum staple
[4:43:53] <Blank9> I love that you can swap legions while the other is unchained
[4:43:54] <daisyyyy> @worldbrand theres a zandatsu like parry you can use to cancel their attacks but its weird
[4:43:57] <Blank9> and it stays out
[4:43:59] <DevinMayCry> Its great that pats playing better but hes gonna get Cs from only using Arm
[4:44:04] <+StrawberryPantsu> B\
[4:44:04] <%kyh9> No, Blue Flashes are whenever you set up a sync attack, red flashes are for incoming attacks
[4:44:12] <+StrawberryPantsu> YEYYEYEYEYE
[4:44:16] <Valdorick> B for time
[4:44:17] <+StrawberryPantsu> I was right
[4:44:21] <Conky89> Just like in school
[4:44:21] <%joylent_blue> Bingo
[4:44:23] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> B for Bon't Worry
[4:44:32] <DevinMayCry> He would have had S+ if he used aarrow and sword
[4:44:34] <+Slowpoking> It's Hip to Rank B
[4:44:35] <%worldbrand> yeah the sync opportunities are generous, making the auto sync ability less valuable for better players
[4:44:35] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat the games ranking doesnt care heavily aboutt you taking damage. It cares about how much you mix it up and use all your stuff.
[4:44:35] <+Snorlax321> B for BAD
[4:44:39] <%EmptyPenguin> why doesn't she have a gas mask...
[4:44:40] <DevinMayCry> Most likely closer to it anyway
[4:44:41] <artificiallynatural> B for BABY
[4:44:44] <%joylent_blue> Sphincter_Spelunker i laughed harder at that than i should have
[4:44:44] <%starotter70> B for Bag
[4:44:46] <DevinMayCry> Arm is fun though
[4:44:56] <%InugamiTheHound> B is for Brave and B is for Bruce
[4:44:56] <+JacktheMan18> Alicia's too tough for a gas mask
[4:44:59] <DevinMayCry> I wanna touch it
[4:45:08] <+Walopoh> Don't judge his Elmo pouch

[4:52:45] <+Walopoh> @AngriestPat do you think they leave this game open for a sequel? (I don't know, so no spoilers)
[4:52:45] <KaliasTV> All the flashbacks as static shots where it doesn't matter as much
[4:52:46] <%Keyd00d> RIP
[4:52:51] <KatabolicRage> you don't need to save the pic for it to count for the database man
[4:52:51] <+Slowpoking> You don't have to save photos to record shit in your log, just say no to saving them
[4:52:53] <This_is_Marco> theres still a surprising amount of level per file
[4:52:54] <Pompadourius> DELETE ALL BY HITTING Y
[4:52:54] <%joylent_blue> don't delete the picture of your dead sister BibleThump
[4:53:03] <Monkeyweed21> LAPPY NO
[4:53:05] <%XeroSigmaPrime> TTHERES A DELETE ALL BUTTON
[4:53:12] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> This camera has about a much picture space as my flip phone did
[4:53:18] <+Slowpoking> The game's director said he has plans for an entire trilogy
[4:53:23] <implied_consent> Never trust a man with the word 'trick' in this name.
[4:53:26] <Conky89> Spiderman PS4 has the best selfie camera. Have spidey take a photo while a major accident is occurring behind him.
[4:53:30] <Soul_Intern> @InugamiTheHound There is no limit, until he's even in a sitcom
[4:53:31] <%joylent_blue> a TRILOGY? sign me the fuck up
[4:53:33] <DevinMayCry> This game has threads open for sequel easily
[4:53:36] <+TheBitingIrish> FIRE HOT!
[4:53:46] <DevinMayCry> No idea what that be
[4:53:49] <DevinMayCry> But you could do it
[4:53:50] <derekwst3> what if i told you this is a secret legend of Zelda game
[4:53:54] <+TheBitingIrish> 'DEIMOS'
[4:53:55] <Pompadourius> If they do a trilogy I hope that they get a bigger budget for an open or semi-open world for the sequel.
[4:53:58] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> game even kinda undoes some stuff in an epilogue to basically be like, we can do sequel don't worry
[4:53:59] <pillowwasp> God damn doom enemy
[4:54:06] <%InugamiTheHound> @Soul_Intern what sitcom is that? TBFP or Castle Super beast?? Hey YO!!!
[4:54:08] <DevinMayCry> @derekwst3 I had that fantasy too
[4:54:09] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> It Kratos bruther
[4:54:11] <KaliasTV> Switch exclusive trilogy though NotLikeThis
[4:54:12] <Dr_Mooose> fire bad
[4:54:18] <%joylent_blue> don't worry about it
[4:54:27] <DevinMayCry> @derekwst3 Its way more likely to be secret SMT though lol
[4:54:29] <Conky89> Fire always seems to be a bastard on game performance.
[4:54:32] <This_is_Marco> I-I actually wish there were less effects so I can see my pokemon in action FeelsBadMan
[4:54:39] <%Keyd00d> use gun when fire
[4:54:46] <DevinMayCry> @This_is_Marco Turning HUD off helps a bit
[4:54:53] <DevinMayCry> I only have lock on now
[4:55:01] <DevinMayCry> Legion meter is on your shoulder and chest

[5:07:12] <%GarbageNirvana> They didn't really need to go this hard
[5:07:16] <Derkinstacker> Axe > sword >Dog >Arms > Arrow.
[5:07:20] <ObsidianDragon86> Yes they did
[5:07:21] <%joylent_blue> pat has no words
[5:07:23] <DevinMayCry> Axe is dope as fuck
[5:07:24] <DSD24> Grinding the sword on the ground is the coolest shit
[5:07:24] <ObsidianDragon86> They absolutely had to
[5:07:27] <MoonlightP> this legion is an apology for not doing bladewolf justice in the mgr dlc
[5:07:29] <DevinMayCry> Especially its sync with Gladius combo
[5:07:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> Arrow is the weakest stand
[5:07:34] <+TheBitingIrish> PAT, CAN YOU RIDE IT OFF LEDGES?!
[5:07:39] <Valdorick> Mount and Blade: CyberDoggo
[5:07:42] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> No need for words. Your raging erection tells everything
[5:07:48] <%joylent_blue> TheBitingIrish yes, frustratingly so
[5:07:50] <DevinMayCry> Its literally the dark knight 80 synced up basically like the XIV job video
[5:08:08] <+TheBitingIrish> ha
[5:08:12] <%starotter70> That one goes well with auto bind
[5:08:16] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah I'm gonna have to go through this game again
[5:08:25] <%GarbageNirvana> There's too much
[5:08:29] <artificiallynatural> I really need to grind the earlier levels
[5:08:41] <+bustawof> howl is a Y
[5:08:46] <+Clik404> @garbagenirvana This game was specifically made with that in mind actually
[5:08:58] <DevinMayCry> Games super about repeat plays
[5:09:18] <Monkeyweed21> RED MATTER
[5:09:21] <DevinMayCry> The red stuff pat you missed some
[5:09:25] <%GarbageNirvana> I suppose that's most Platinum games though ain't it
[5:09:27] <%Eaglestrike117> get ready for the worst section of this level, cause fuck it
[5:09:29] <%joylent_blue> excuse me pat why are you using your legs
[5:09:32] <MasterDecoder> Pat didn't finish yet, did he?
[5:09:33] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> you might consider using hit rush in combos to have 2 stands active at a time
[5:09:34] <NiktenKing> Just use mount mode
[5:09:39] <%joylent_blue> MasterDecoder nope
[5:09:39] <Derkinstacker> RIP
[5:09:42] <Monkeyweed21> use iris
[5:09:43] <MasterDecoder> Ok, good
[5:09:44] <+Slowpoking> Gotta go fast
[5:10:01] <%Laecerelius> Look at Pat walking like some mountless pleb
[5:10:08] <%Yadogari> Just ride the dog
[5:10:15] <Derkinstacker> Ride dog.

[5:11:08] <+Clik404> @thebitingirish 12
[5:11:09] <Derkinstacker> 11
[5:11:12] <%starotter70> yup
[5:11:13] <NiktenKing> He can't float
[5:11:17] <artificiallynatural> he no fly
[5:11:17] <NiktenKing> She rather
[5:11:17] <+StrawberryPantsu> Pupper cant fly
[5:11:29] <ObsidianDragon86> Makes sense cause Pupper can run
[5:11:32] <tigerfang86> she's no flydog
[5:11:35] <%dekkitout> One day she'll get her wings :(
[5:11:38] <%InugamiTheHound> she is just a dog
[5:11:47] <tigerfang86> DYING VENDING WAIFU
[5:11:49] <artificiallynatural> she's also the only one that actually takes time turning
[5:11:51] <Valdorick> Sick Vending-chan D:
[5:12:06] <%joylent_blue> they had to nerf her somehow
[5:12:07] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> The vending machine has lungs to cough. I don't like this
[5:12:08] <%dekkitout> Vending-chan's got anime mom disease
[5:12:10] <NiktenKing> A DIEFU if you may
[5:12:10] <KaliasTV> Huh, whatever happened to the floating robot mascot
[5:12:11] <InvaderKAZ> You can tap ZL to make the dog jump over gaps if you're too lazy to switch to a flying Legion
[5:12:17] <KaliasTV> Not seen it all stream
[5:12:28] <ObsidianDragon86> So Doggo no fly, but Doggo jumps?
[5:12:31] <+Clik404> Beasty is ground-bound, which has the benefit of making her much faster
[5:12:46] <+Clik404> Traction and all that
[5:12:50] <DevinMayCry> The dogs run auto dodges some attacks its broken as fuck
[5:12:50] <%joylent_blue> KaliasTV do you mean Hal? the little yellow robot? eh, he's around
[5:12:51] <anuchallengertwitch> gonna sign off. goodnight. Thanks for the stream.

[5:14:02] <BlindGato> Bladewolf?!?!?!?!
[5:14:03] <Zombrocom> Go Sif!
[5:14:07] <CurrySauseBandit> What a good boi! PogChamp
[5:14:17] <NiktenKing> It's Bladewolf + DD w/Knife
[5:14:19] <Derkinstacker> Then theres arrow shitting up the show.
[5:14:34] <%joylent_blue> hey, Arrow's doing his best
[5:14:35] <LandOfTheWay> SIF ARTORIAS TAG TEAM
[5:14:41] <SulfurousAcid> GG EZ
[5:14:45] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[5:14:55] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Dismal
[5:14:56] <%worldbrand> that is tighter than i expected
[5:14:59] <+rei0> did pat unlock perfect call?
[5:15:00] <Derkinstacker> Once you realize you can just LZ a stand to knock those guys out of the sky, he becomes entirely worthless.
[5:15:01] <+StrawberryPantsu> >What if V was better to play as the game
[5:15:19] <%joylent_blue> what if V wasnt a crumbling piece of shit, the game
[5:15:20] <%worldbrand> nope they're both there
[5:15:36] <%worldbrand> what the dick
[5:15:40] <%joylent_blue> nb
[5:15:41] <Soul_Intern> FUCK
[5:15:42] <Zombrocom> That goes for AWHILE
[5:15:45] <artificiallynatural> Holy it lasts so long
[5:15:49] <Derkinstacker> legit the best perfect call.
[5:15:52] <ObsidianDragon86> DOGGO CONFIRMED BEST STAND!
[5:15:54] <WhereIsWill> doggo becomes summon swords tho
[5:15:58] <+Dorf1> i havent been able to perfect call outside of testing it
[5:16:05] <SleepyMaribo> so theres a ability that lets you auto sync attack
[5:16:11] <%dekkitout> As tricky as that timing look, that looks 10x more rewarding
[5:16:27] <%joylent_blue> SleepyMaribo yeah, its great, spoils you though lol
[5:16:43] <%chronotriggerhappy123> dont fight there
[5:16:48] <%dekkitout> Nailed it- tajPF
[5:16:49] <InvaderKAZ> I don't see why you'd need auto sync attack since the timing is really easy
[5:16:49] <%joylent_blue> ????? the hell
[5:16:50] <Derkinstacker> WOW
[5:16:55] <+Fynale> so is this a character action game or an action rpg like nier
[5:16:58] <SleepyMaribo> i have a set up thats auto sync, with crits and heal on perfect syncs
[5:17:00] <Pompadourius> I save auto sync attack for Arrow Legion because whatever with that.
[5:17:14] <Pompadourius> @Fynale Definitely not an RPG. Big character action.
[5:17:18] <Dead_Euronymous> Auto Sync Attack is one of the best abilities in the game, lets you focus on the fight more.
[5:17:25] <+Fynale> but pat is using the items
[5:17:35] <Derkinstacker> Use LZ on arm stand to bring them over to you.
[5:17:42] <+Frankyzappa> I'll be damned, we Bladewolf now?
[5:17:45] <+Dorf1> finish off being a full heal makes this game very forgiving
[5:18:01] <%starotter70> @Fynale Doesn't actually take ranking off by using it
[5:18:01] <%Keyd00d> reeeee
[5:18:05] <%starotter70> I think
[5:18:10] <+Fynale> SIF
[5:18:10] <NiktenKing> Did the dog just catapult... er dogapult you at the enemy?
[5:18:13] <tigerfang86> COMBINATION COMPLETE
[5:18:18] <+Maximum_KIX> Items actually get you points tho
[5:18:21] <tragicjohnson84> Good boy Doggo
[5:18:24] <+Fynale> a warrior uses all of his tools
[5:18:26] <%dekkitout> So remember what I said about how cool it'd be to have a bird-Legion... FeelsBadMan
[5:18:27] <Pompadourius> There's a bonus for using no items in a fight, but there's ALSO a bonus for using LOTS of items.
[5:18:29] <tigerfang86> good girl doggo
[5:18:29] <%starotter70> Kyle!?
[5:18:30] <KaliasTV> Oh

[5:45:56] <monaman1> @AngriestPat a little late but Get Fucked Konami!
[5:45:57] <%joylent_blue> the Lappy Christmas Eve one just talks about how no one wanted to eat Lappy's christmas cookies
[5:45:59] <InvaderKAZ> Basically it just gives background to how the Ark was made
[5:46:00] <Blank9> oh this chapter is great
[5:46:00] <%miguelrod777> read the files on your suster and dad
[5:46:06] <+Slowpoking> Use the Lappy shortcuts
[5:46:06] <%joylent_blue> except Max, Max ate the cookies
[5:46:16] <%dekkitout> "I just wanna play fetch with my Eva-Stands"
[5:46:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> so this is basically the halfway point huh
[5:46:17] <spardanwarrior> @AngriestPat also, if you want I can give you the password, there are no spoilers in those locked files, it's just some easter eggs.
[5:46:20] <Derkinstacker> Lappy shortcuts are just holes in the wall.

[5:46:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> probably
[5:46:38] <%joylent_blue> no
[5:46:40] <%starotter70> You can play an earlier one and do this one
[5:46:40] <KatabolicRage> no
[5:46:41] <Blank9> you basically select verses
[5:46:41] <+hazzy_o7> You can go back from options right now
[5:46:43] <%Keyd00d> no you restart the chapter?
[5:46:45] <cherrycottontail> no just go start another hcapter
[5:46:45] <+Slowpoking> Sell your junk
