[0:02:21] <+TimeToChrom> oh my god youre awake at a normal hour for hawaii people! aloha
[0:02:24] <coach_streams> They did a 9 hour stream and I said THANK YOU SIR, MAY I HAVE ANOTHER
[0:02:25] <%DianaTheAscian> They clearly have no idea what to do with SCH
[0:02:27] <%VictorVonLouche> SCH got screwed over hard, they need so much QoL and skill changes for synergy
[0:02:33] <+sleepers1mulant> Pat I got work in the morning man cmon
[0:02:33] <@Jekado> "Such Awakestation was never my intent"
[0:02:35] <@SpaceCapnCrone> Thank you to everyone in chat for joining us for this new low.
[0:02:36] <+favadem> 5am where i live, oh boy...
[0:02:39] <+Caidezes> I hope he streams for another nine hours to go along with Paige's stream.
[0:02:39] <+carfar_farcar> imagine staying up this late for a game you enjoy
[0:02:41] <%tusk102> what happened to sch
[0:02:45] <+SolGainer> YO SMN THO
[0:02:45] <tanarath> Because Pat's going to stream for another hour or two after Paige's nearly 9 where he read a bunch?
[0:02:48] <%Nekros4442> i wanted Titania summon for Sch
[0:02:51] <%RayReborne> So Paige finshed streaming deltarune chaoter 2 and pat was like oh man, i REALLY wanna talk about the FfXIV liveletter fuck everybody else Kappa
[0:02:52] <@Jekado> @sleepers1mulant Live Letter is your job now!
[0:02:53] <detritusmaximus> SeemsGood
[0:02:57] <natscazz> Maybe SCH will get repaired like MNK has been over the last few patches?
[0:03:00] <+sleepers1mulant> Any good WAR changes
[0:03:01] <+cokefiend> that smn revamp bizChamp
[0:03:02] <%RealThiele> in before pat just marathons the whole live letter

[0:03:06] <knight_verse> Damn it Pat, GO TO SLEEP ALREADY.
[0:03:06] <tanarath> I'm not hooked on 14,but I get he's hype, good for him.
[0:03:08] <Lagseene> Omay ga Path is streaming??? wwho would've known
[0:03:15] <%Nekros4442> @sleepers1mulant gap closer doesnt cost meter
[0:03:18] <+TimeToChrom> did chief gief wake the house up or something
[0:03:22] <%tusk102> @sleepers1mulant gap closer is free apparently
[0:03:30] <+SolGainer> Sage and reaper both look great
[0:03:31] <+sleepers1mulant> Hallelujah
[0:03:34] <%DianaTheAscian> Unless he watches them show off all the differences
[0:03:37] <@TheYellowcouch> Scholar died so summoner and sage could flourish. truly the selflessest of helaers
[0:03:38] <lebel188> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis damn I’m tired
[0:03:46] <%NopeBadguy> @sleepers1mulant onslaught and upheaval are charges and not meter skills, ir ender
[0:03:47] <%DianaTheAscian> then maybe 3-3 1/2
[0:03:48] <%RealThiele> WAR should have had a gap closer that worked better when paladin got theirs
[0:03:49] <knight_verse> @timetochrom Pat must have had a nightmare and is now too scared to go to sleep.
[0:03:56] <amonimis> is pat having trouble sleepin or somethin
[0:03:57] <moink1234> Is this the peach saliva waiting room
[0:04:01] <%tusk102> WHAT HAPPENED TO SCH
[0:04:03] <%SpontaneousC> SpontaneousC subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[0:04:10] <@TheYellowcouch> Nothing happened to scholar
[0:04:12] <+enternius> Not a ton
[0:04:15] <%nip_nips> sch was a necessary sacrifice
[0:04:15] <+TimeToChrom> this is the only canon i accept. please dont have spooky dreams pat
[0:04:16] <%RealThiele> Paige stream just ended, pat is now streaming live letter reaction
[0:04:18] <%Speed1ines> @tusk102 Nothing, that's the problem
[0:04:20] <%Nekros4442> Nothinf happened to SCH. thats the problem

[0:04:24] <%tusk102> @amonimis no, Paige JUST finished deltarune
[0:04:25] <%CalderGaming> it can make everyone sprint now :/
[0:04:28] <%RayReborne> man I should sleep, i got a date in 58 hours Kappa
[0:04:30] <+SolGainer> SCH got combat Peloton and nothing else
[0:04:30] <%Nobrev> I just got off a stream going over the whole live letter. time to get right onto another one haha
[0:04:30] <%tusk102> oh literally nothing was changed
[0:04:33] <%tusk102> oh boy
[0:04:33] <nicegrandmafingers> i can take a 5am stream but i cant take memers pretending sch isn't fine and is actually as bad as shadowbringers monk or summoner
[0:04:34] <+Caidezes> Surprised so many people missed Paige's nine hour stream.
[0:04:36] <%SpontaneousC> does pat just not sleep any more
[0:04:38] <@TheYellowcouch> I quote "There wasn't much we could change about scholar"
[0:04:40] <%Speed1ines> Actually I lied, Sage happened to SCH
[0:04:42] <+sleepers1mulant> I’m sleep now I’ll catch VOD tomorrow night yall
[0:04:47] <+enternius> It will be stronger now because of the 1.5s nuke cast time but it doesn't look much cooler visually
[0:04:50] <+SolGainer> DRK also didn’t change much at all
[0:04:52] <Blank9> sleep is for the week
[0:04:53] <amonimis> @tusk102 oh LUL
[0:04:56] <+TimeToChrom> @RayReborne tell her she or he looks beautiful
[0:05:01] <%tusk102> @SpontaneousC paige just finished deltarune chapter 2
[0:05:02] <%DianaTheAscian> @Caidezes A lot of us had to go play Deltarune ourselves
[0:05:02] <natscazz> Maybe there's more to the SCH changes that will be in written form later?
[0:05:03] <knight_verse> Pat, some of us are nornal himan beings that need sleep, Y U do this?
[0:05:05] <%RealThiele> yea sage got all the cool scholar stuff
[0:05:09] <nicegrandmafingers> sch is getting technical changes but no it did not go back to stormblood

[0:05:15] <quest_dad> hey pat and chat, I live in England so this is the first time I've actually caught one of the streams live due to bullshit timezones! 😀 hope everyone is well!
[0:05:19] <%DianaTheAscian> DRK didn't get much but thats fine
[0:05:24] <+SolGainer> All healers got buffed with the 1.5 cast time tho. Can actually weave on WHM now
[0:05:27] <%RayReborne> @timetochrom will do
[0:05:29] <%tactician0> oh yeah
[0:05:33] <nicegrandmafingers> the cast time alone changes the job
[0:05:33] <@QueequegTheater> WAR CHADS ALWAYS WIN
[0:05:40] <+TimeToChrom> everyone sad about sleep hours. meanwhile this is my first normal night time stream

[0:07:47] <+zamatermort> It is no longer late, it is early
[0:07:51] <+TimeToChrom> hes actually going to shit his pants
[0:07:52] <ExistentialSteak> Sage and SCH is literally the Chad vs Virgin meme
[0:07:52] <+Caidezes> It's not late. It's early.
[0:07:54] <haisho> I'm just gonna listen to this as I grind my brains out in HoH

[0:08:51] <RushUnplugged> SMN looks insane

[0:28:26] <+KawaiiJetty> Heard you like big swords
[0:28:29] <%NopeBadguy> I CANT BELIEVE THEY GAVE PALADIN AN INNER RELEASE

[0:28:49] <%JGardner03> That didn't really feel like 18m when I first saw it lmao
[0:28:49] <%tusk102> sch mains found dead in miami
[0:28:54] <RaidenRising> yooo sch got fucked
[0:28:54] <%miguelrod777> I am the bone of my sword
[0:28:56] <Kekon3> SCH benefits the most from the universal changes, potencies will likely be high, has the best slide cast in the game and instacast shields. SCH isn’t flashy but is just gonna be sturdy rotation wise from the looks of it.
[0:28:57] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Ranged attack doesn't break combo anymore btw
[0:28:58] <%VictorVonLouche> except for sch
[0:29:00] <@TheYellowcouch> PUT ME IN A COMA UNTIL NOVEMBER

[0:29:46] <penitentpendant> Speedrun Liveletter Any%
[0:29:48] <BluBox> The animation for it is dope as hell
[0:29:50] <Saltmeisterr> Cool art
[0:29:56] <Fiendmaw> Sick
[0:29:58] <%RealThiele> 60
[0:30:01] <+RocketBarrel> Title Screen no longer yells at you yay
[0:30:01] <+SolGainer> It was SICK
[0:30:03] <%NitronStreams> TIME FANCY WORDS AND BIG NUMBERS
[0:30:05] <+neoexogene> N U T
[0:30:05] <Kekon3> Also for some reason they mentioned SCH has a single target buff but forgot to talk about it at all
[0:30:09] <@TheYellowcouch> 60 second delirium!
[0:30:17] <+enternius> MNK being a 90s rotation is so cursed
[0:30:21] <Fiendmaw> Except Leylines
[0:30:22] <@QueequegTheater> 60 sec IR WOOOO
[0:30:22] <Thenuclearwalrus> *EXCEPT LEY LINES
[0:30:24] <%Speed1ines> Look at that smug ass DRK
[0:30:30] <%sniffy77> sniffy77 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Hey Pat, have you ever seen a drive thru line block an entire street? Because I saw a very busy street be blocked for 10-15 minutes because someone wanted a drive thru salad and didn't care if they cause 40 cars to be stuck behind them.
[0:30:33] <TheMadBadger> That's also for melee btw
[0:30:33] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:30:34] <%RealThiele> can actually chain pull better
[0:30:34] <+SolGainer> 60 sec IR ON WAR Pog
[0:30:35] <T_Sasquatch> The hell does that mean LUL
[0:30:37] <Kekon3> Everything lines up in 60/120 is a SCH buff
[0:30:39] <fudgsicles117> finally
[0:30:48] <Daniel_Is_I> That means you can Unmend without breaking combo
[0:30:49] <KoyaMusa> they implied the defensive enhancements were like how you use tbn right?
[0:30:49] <heartlesshealer> Timed Guards?
[0:30:50] <@SpaceCapnCrone> I think the defensive buff thing is like how GNB has synergy between brutal shell and heart of stone.
[0:30:57] <+neoexogene> Fucking finally
[0:30:58] <%RealThiele> thank god
[0:31:03] <+rontopronto> Pat it’s so late.
[0:31:05] <+neoexogene> This was my ONLY gripe with tanks
[0:31:11] <+MarkGearRex> all tanks are royal guard now
[0:31:13] <%TheHateFish> @PatStaresAt They explained it a bit more in the video - seems like it's gonna be like 20% for a second or two, followed by like five or so of 10%
[0:31:16] <+SolGainer> No timed guards it’s like TBN
[0:31:18] <+rontopronto> Or early I guess
[0:31:21] <@TheYellowcouch> it is
[0:31:21] <%CalderGaming> @T_Sasquatch so like if you're a tank doing your melee combo 1 2 3 and you throw out your ranged attack between 1 and 2, you don't have to start the combo over
[0:31:24] <BluBox> Beach gauge
[0:31:24] <@QueequegTheater> They just gave them GNB
[0:31:24] <+Phoenon> Beach Gauge PogChamp
[0:31:28] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt the greater benefits thing is some sort of "you get a buff if you do a cool down before TB"
[0:31:55] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt WAR is the only one that requires a single-target GCD to apply its buff
[0:31:55] <%VictorVonLouche> Males tanks less brain dead at least lol
[0:31:57] <+neoexogene> @dianatheascian so fucking ROYALGUARD !?
[0:32:00] <%VictorVonLouche> Makes*
[0:32:02] <@QueequegTheater> This fixes it
[0:32:03] <T_Sasquatch> @caldergaming i meant the defensive abilities will give better benefits part
[0:32:14] <Daniel_Is_I> Yeah
[0:32:17] <%DianaTheAscian> @neoexogene yeah kinda LUL
[0:32:18] <%arkv01> feels AMAZING man
[0:32:21] <@QueequegTheater> IR and Worse IR you mean Kappa
[0:32:26] <+Phoenon> Even more Fray DPS
[0:32:26] <%RealThiele> new stuff
[0:32:35] <+K1LLW1N> so skill speed not needed so much now?
[0:32:36] <%RealThiele> yea Fray didnt show up
[0:32:40] <+enternius> Upgraded Flood I guess
[0:32:46] <%RealThiele> thank god
[0:32:47] <@TheYellowcouch> One button
[0:32:47] <Daniel_Is_I> It's like a PVP action
[0:32:51] <+cokefiend> 1 button like the instances
[0:32:53] <@TheYellowcouch> One button for full combo
[0:32:54] <fran031> PVP combo
[0:32:55] <night__monkey> rip xivcombo
[0:32:55] <Tooniearcade> one button combo
[0:32:59] <BluBox> One button for the GCD attacks
[0:33:00] <%RealThiele> button crunch is gud
[0:33:00] <BluBox> Yeah
[0:33:01] <%Chichen> 2 buttons instead of 4
[0:33:02] <@TheYellowcouch> Yeah
[0:33:03] <+neoexogene> Tank adjustment: you can now kiss Fray on the lips
[0:33:04] <@QueequegTheater> PvP combos
[0:33:04] <@SpaceCapnCrone> 2 instead of 4 yeah
[0:33:04] <%DianaTheAscian> Cool
[0:33:04] <+ASleepySnek> yes
[0:33:05] <+SolGainer> XIV combo
[0:33:05] <T_Sasquatch> Ehhhhyy
[0:33:07] <Daniel_Is_I> One button for the gnashing combo, one for cont
[0:33:12] <Fiendmaw> 2 buttons ye
[0:33:13] <%tusk102> 2 instead of 4
[0:33:18] <TheMadBadger> Less button bloat! rooComfies
[0:33:19] <haisho> one for Gnashing Fang, another for Continuation
[0:33:20] <+RocketBarrel> got rid button bloat
[0:33:20] <@TheYellowcouch> Greatest change ever
[0:33:22] <joshujostar> its fun with WXHB continuation tho
[0:33:24] <Kekon3> You hit two buttons back and fourth
[0:33:24] <%CalderGaming> @T_Sasquatch oh that part was about defensive abilities having enhanced effects for like the first couple of seconds, so you're rewarded for timing but it's not so tight that it's a pain with server ping
[0:33:29] <@TheYellowcouch> Also applicable to addle
[0:33:29] <RushUnplugged> GNB having so many buttons was the one thing I didn't like and it's FIXED
[0:33:33] <TheMadBadger> Feint is now useful!
[0:33:48] <@TheYellowcouch> do all the aoe
[0:33:52] <@QueequegTheater> Feint is actually worth putting on the bar
[0:33:54] <Kekon3> Too many SHB savages were magical lmao
[0:33:57] <OneThousandTomatoes> how are things going? late isn't it?
[0:33:57] <%AncelDeLambert> dragoon go splish-splash
[0:33:58] <+Birdigalore> Do moar combo
[0:34:06] <@QueequegTheater> Raiden Thrust 2
[0:34:15] <haisho> Blood being a trait is SO DELICIOUS
[0:34:16] <Kekon3> Feint became anti-autos for prog and floor 4
[0:34:19] <%RealThiele> Blitz netcode in 14

[0:34:32] <+Phoenon> Monk looks sick now
[0:34:32] <@TheYellowcouch> It's like a mix onf ninja mudras and astro cards
[0:34:34] <%VermilionPlum> VermilionPlum subscribed at Tier 1.

[0:35:44] <Fiendmaw> More like DRG
[0:35:44] <%arkv01> 🤔
[0:35:44] <+enternius> It's almost completely selfish
[0:35:45] <penitentpendant> Eye and AoE Buff
[0:35:45] <%RealThiele> yo party i got souls for y'all eat up
[0:35:45] <BluBox> More like DRG
[0:35:46] <+ASleepySnek> it just has a party buff
[0:35:47] <%DianaTheAscian> A lot of these are just straight upgrades which is nice
[0:35:48] <@Velyndra> more like drg or mnk
[0:35:49] <+SolGainer> No
[0:35:50] <@Velyndra> it has party buffs
[0:35:50] <+enternius> It's way closer to SAM than DRG
[0:35:53] <Fiendmaw> And MNK I suppose
[0:35:56] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I think it just means it's not selfish
[0:35:57] <heartlesshealer> :)
[0:36:03] <@TheYellowcouch> Love dps dark knight
[0:36:23] <+SolGainer> Fusion overrides your glam LUL

[0:36:32] <@TheYellowcouch> Yeah ranged are just "we did them cooler"
[0:36:32] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Punch Bard has a lot of untapped potential
[0:36:33] <penitentpendant> Flaming Puncha
[0:36:35] <T_Sasquatch> Doesn't all these cool down changes severely affect the fights in the game ?
[0:36:36] <%RealThiele> SICK
[0:36:53] <night__monkey> making MCH even easier to solo POTD with 2 reassembles
[0:37:00] <nicegrandmafingers> they're redoing numbers for the whole game anyway
[0:37:01] <@QueequegTheater> @T_Sasquatch Not really, just brings them in line with the 60-second burst windows
[0:37:09] <DarkCloud79> BRD and SCH rip
[0:37:24] <@TheYellowcouch> IT'S SO GOOD

[0:41:44] <penitentpendant> Ranged DPS: "Wait, that's our gimmick?"
[0:41:44] <@TheYellowcouch> Also everyone is gonna get a holy like it seems with a different effect

[0:41:55] <%beepbeepbopbop> kinda sorta?
[0:41:56] <@TheYellowcouch> "There's nothing we can change"
[0:41:57] <+BloodyBurney> need to see it in the media tour, but its not looking good
[0:41:57] <+RocketBarrel> Yes
[0:41:59] <Asterlinn> They know what to do with scholar
[0:42:00] <@TheYellowcouch> ACTUAL QUOTE
[0:42:00] <Asterlinn> they mad sage
[0:42:00] <+Solutha> Basically
[0:42:02] <+cokefiend> chat on twitch and youtube exploded LUL

[0:42:04] <nicegrandmafingers> they said it's fine
[0:42:04] <Blank9> yes
[0:42:04] <%VictorVonLouche> When half their skills clash
[0:42:05] <+truedankfist> it's cause sch is perfect
[0:42:08] <%Speed1ines> no in those words but basically
[0:42:09] <Thenuclearwalrus> Just make it FFXI Scholar, fuck it
[0:42:10] <%tusk102> "we didnt really know what to change"
[0:42:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> well not in that tone
[0:42:11] <night__monkey> SCH has the shed all to itself
[0:42:12] <Tooniearcade> Speed buff to run from their problems
[0:42:12] <+enternius> They said they didn't know what to change, it was already so optimized
[0:42:12] <Octopimp> give scholar a gun
[0:42:14] <nicegrandmafingers> they did not say they dont know what to do
[0:42:14] <+maffewsus> Oh hell yeah Pat
[0:42:14] <T_Sasquatch> What's wrong with sch anyway ? Its fine
[0:42:15] <BluBox> Not literally but basically
[0:42:15] <@QueequegTheater> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:42:17] <@TheYellowcouch> NEW SCHOLAR
[0:42:21] <Kekon3> Cuz SCH has so much from the universal changes
[0:42:21] <Fiendmaw> SCH is a fine job in ShB
[0:42:21] <%RealThiele> ALL, not you SCH
[0:42:22] <@TheYellowcouch> LET'S GOOOO
[0:42:23] <haisho> Scholar does its job so well it doesn't need changing LUL
[0:42:24] <Kekon3> It’s kinda ridiculous
[0:42:25] <+SolGainer> It was HILARIOUS
[0:42:27] <+ASleepySnek> disc priest from wow
[0:42:28] <%Chichen> GREEN DPS
[0:42:29] <Thenuclearwalrus> DISC PRIEST
[0:42:30] <Goraka91> Yes
[0:42:32] <Xelhesia> yup
[0:42:33] <@TheYellowcouch> Sage meta is now
[0:42:34] <TheMadBadger> Yuuup
[0:42:35] <Asterlinn> Sages can fucking FLY
[0:42:36] <RaidenRising> green dps lets gooo

[0:42:39] <rReizs> pat they have always been green DPS
[0:42:40] <Goraka91> It's also cool, so oh no
[0:42:41] <%JGardner03> Scholar is fine right now isn't it? So it's fine with minimal changes right now
[0:42:42] <tanarath> Shielding is disgusting
[0:42:43] <%beepbeepbopbop> The sound though
[0:42:43] <%VictorVonLouche> Yeah total rip for sch
[0:42:43] <$ChrustosKing> @PatStaresAt its redmage but healer basiicaly
[0:42:44] <%Nobrev> finally a healer i'll actually play
[0:42:45] <fudgsicles117> Sage dabbing on SCH corpse
[0:42:45] <%Agami23> they are a vampire healer. deal damage to heal
[0:42:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> what's the issue with scholar?
[0:42:45] <+neoexogene> REAL SCH
[0:42:45] <penitentpendant> So when you see a Sage try to healbot, you can be EXTRA SALTY when they don't attack
[0:42:46] <+K1LLW1N> but you can only have 1 sooo xD
[0:42:46] <zaephia> And if it gets people to flex to healing? GOOOOOOD
[0:42:49] <heartlesshealer> oh man
[0:42:49] <rReizs> EVER SINCE HEAVENSWARD
[0:42:50] <%DianaTheAscian> I was already gonna play it but now I SUPER WANT TO PLAY IT
[0:42:51] <%Divryne> Sage gets Dark Arts lul.
[0:42:53] <%Chichen> you partner a player and your dps moves heal them as sage @PatStaresAt
[0:42:53] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Warrior/Sage dungeon speedruns looking good
[0:42:55] <%moonmintparadise> might not be as strong tho
[0:42:55] <nevan_44> its the only healer i WANT to play  LUL
[0:43:03] <night__monkey> imagine ever taking SCH over Sage LUL
[0:43:07] <%Speed1ines> Pure healer and sage
[0:43:08] <%RealThiele> so lame and good healer
[0:43:09] <TheMadBadger> So, one Sage and then one WHM/AST rooKek
[0:43:09] <+ASleepySnek> 2 chests only
[0:43:09] <%VictorVonLouche> Party will include one pure healer and one sage
[0:43:13] <nicegrandmafingers> the issue with scholar is the community is comprised of shitposters
[0:43:15] <heartlesshealer> here we go, real party shit
[0:43:19] <+SolGainer> RIP SCH

[0:43:38] <%Shunkles> psaUp

[0:43:47] <maglebeast> I'm really new to FFXIV. What does that mean?
[0:43:49] <%Agami23> if your lucky, you get everyone a weapon in 4 runs
[0:43:50] <%moonmintparadise> Pat does the big cum
[0:43:51] <@TheYellowcouch> watch that next slide
[0:43:52] <%Divryne> It’s cause there are too many jobs now.
[0:43:54] <%Nobrev> hallelujah
[0:43:54] <%Dopamien> dungeon mobs also don't give exp
[0:43:56] <maglebeast> the weapon coffer stuff
[0:43:57] <tanarath> God, I wish WoW had like a fifth of this.
[0:43:58] <%tusk102> @maglebeast less grind
[0:43:59] <RaidenRising> less grind
[0:44:04] <tanarath> Even a tenth.
[0:44:04] <+Phoenon> ayy Coil of Bahamut buffs
[0:44:04] <haisho> it means you don't grind your brain into dust to get the weapon you want
[0:44:06] <@QueequegTheater> @maglebeast Coffer means that you get a weapon of whatever class you have equipped when you open it
[0:44:08] <T_Sasquatch> @maglebeast basically less grind
[0:44:10] <%RealThiele> @maglebeast means less grinding for gear or glamours
[0:44:13] <%Chichen> old savage content easier to fark
[0:44:14] <@TheYellowcouch> Grinding is a cake now
[0:44:15] <%Chichen> farm*
[0:44:15] <rReizs> updating old shit
[0:44:18] <+neoexogene> @maglebeast you don’t have to grind for weapons as much
[0:44:21] <TheMadBadger> @maglebeast In Savage Tier raids, you're guaranteed to get your weapon within 8 runs for your team.
[0:44:27] <haisho> COFFERS FOR EVERYONE
[0:44:34] <OneThousandTomatoes> procs
[0:44:36] <@TheYellowcouch> This is a really sweet quality of life
[0:44:36] <maglebeast> ah I see. thanks folks
[0:44:42] <rReizs> PROCS
[0:44:43] <%tusk102> lmao
[0:44:43] <%CalderGaming> lol
[0:44:43] <$sarah_galb> ENHANCE
[0:44:44] <%Nobrev> LUL
[0:44:47] <+Kyma1020> zoomed?
[0:44:49] <tanarath> Full screen
[0:44:53] <@QueequegTheater> monkaW
[0:44:53] <+cokefiend> good QOL stuff
[0:44:54] <nevan_44> LUL
[0:44:56] <@QueequegTheater> monkaS
[0:44:58] <%DianaTheAscian> A lot of this is quality of life which is great
[0:45:04] <OneThousandTomatoes> this is nice
[0:45:04] <haisho> they split actual buffs and conditional triggers like Firestarter and it's nice
[0:45:08] <%Agami23> this is a wild and good adition
[0:45:09] <%RealThiele> oooh for controller thats huge
[0:45:10] <penitentpendant> No longer have to guess range
[0:45:10] <@QueequegTheater> Almost revealed your big pornz
[0:45:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> especially for controller
[0:45:13] <+grenberr1> gonna want to watrch the video on this one
[0:45:14] <KoyaMusa> that's for stuff like shukuchi
[0:45:16] <Fiendmaw> Watch the video
[0:45:17] <RushUnplugged> that is a great one
[0:45:17] <@JustinianKnight> ITS HUGE
[0:45:19] <Daniel_Is_I> For stuff like Shukuchi too
[0:45:20] <@JustinianKnight> FOR NIN
[0:45:21] <rReizs> just in time for salted earth to be character targeted
[0:45:25] <%VictorVonLouche> So you cant miss your AOE
[0:45:26] <@TheYellowcouch> It's an option to now have ground target go outside it's effective rang
[0:45:26] <OneThousandTomatoes> they did a video of it
[0:45:28] <%tusk102> its good for controllers
[0:45:30] <heartlesshealer> cursor stopped by walls it seems
[0:45:34] <@QueequegTheater> Good for healers
[0:45:34] <fudgsicles117> no longer X to confirm sounds like
[0:45:35] <haisho> probably important for healers
[0:45:37] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt look at the video
[0:45:38] <@TheYellowcouch> target NOT go outside it's range
[0:45:39] <Goraka91> You can't place it outside of range
[0:45:39] <RushUnplugged> if range is say 60, you can't move your cursor past 60
[0:45:39] <L_Cypher1234> new ground target for that Soil that won't go down
[0:45:40] <+radda343> the target circle can't go out of the skill/item's range
[0:45:41] <CaptainBright> Can someone get Pat to drink Monster out of a shoe like Steve Buscemi just did with Fosters?
[0:45:42] <dagreenpillow> for Shukuchi
[0:45:43] <%crimsonharvest> that means you can just hammer the button instead of aiming your fuckin AOE shield
[0:45:45] <Fiendmaw> There's no video?
[0:45:46] <dagreenpillow> and healers
[0:45:48] <+Kyma1020> stuff like shikuchi, asylum and stuff
[0:45:49] <Daniel_Is_I> Controller users can double-tap, and you can constrain it to max range of the ability
[0:45:49] <%DianaTheAscian> damn
[0:45:50] <%Agami23> you dont click allies, and it stops when hitting the max distance
[0:45:52] <@JustinianKnight> basically you cant overshoot the skill
[0:45:52] <penitentpendant> So targeted AoEs you could aim 'beyond' where you'd put it. Now it STOPS so you can only aim where you CAN put it donw.
[0:45:59] <Thenuclearwalrus> Smart aoe targeting?
[0:46:03] <Thenuclearwalrus> FINALLY
[0:46:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> this is ok
[0:46:12] <Asterlinn> No more raising the same person
[0:46:12] <%DianaTheAscian> Cool
[0:46:15] <heartlesshealer> <3
[0:46:16] <+Phoenon> Helps so you can tell who healer's Ressing if you're a cohealer I guess
[0:46:21] <%RealThiele> fuck belts
[0:46:22] <Goraka91> 🦀

[0:46:49] <T_Sasquatch> @itselguapo faux leaves
[0:46:50] <nicegrandmafingers> unreal let you play a shitty minigame
[0:46:51] <+SolGainer> Unreal was for very bored people
[0:46:54] <heartlesshealer> speed ring to replace speed belt
[0:46:58] <%DianaTheAscian> They just take up space
[0:46:59] <@JustinianKnight> crab belt become crab ring
[0:46:59] <nicegrandmafingers> for 1 unique minion
[0:47:00] <+neoexogene> Pants: WE FAAAAALL
[0:47:00] <OkamiDude15> belts coming back in pog form

[0:47:01] <+Heatonist> is the stream skipping back for anyone else
[0:47:02] <nicegrandmafingers> and mount recolors
[0:47:07] <+AugustHaze> They will prolly delete them later
[0:47:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah
[0:47:11] <+cokefiend> Echo 2 PogChamp
[0:47:12] <penitentpendant> Super Echo to compensate for unsyncing~
[0:47:12] <nicegrandmafingers> and you have to play terrible old trials for it too
[0:47:14] <%RealThiele> forget some raid and get peole murdered
[0:47:19] <Daniel_Is_I> You get a buff if you're soloing old content
[0:47:22] <Thenuclearwalrus> The squish is pretty big, 45k hp at level 90 on dps
[0:47:23] <@JustinianKnight> no
[0:47:27] <%AlteisenReiseZ> HW Numbers for reference
[0:47:28] <%DianaTheAscian> Its gonna be fucked up
[0:47:30] <OneThousandTomatoes> probably, but not too bad
[0:47:33] <@JustinianKnight> you dont have the context of them talking about it
[0:47:36] <+SolGainer> They said they’re doing this to prep for the NEXT DECADE OF FFXIV
[0:47:40] <+Itselguapo> @RocketBarrel anything good?
[0:47:46] <@TheYellowcouch> Let's hope it doesn't
[0:47:46] <@JustinianKnight> theyre making it in line with how it currently is
[0:47:55] <eristhanewood> yay
[0:47:55] <@TheYellowcouch> This was a weird one
[0:47:55] <T_Sasquatch> What
[0:47:58] <haisho> they just moved the EXP to the bosses instead of having to go out of your way to murder everything
[0:47:59] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt the videos also show the damage values now
[0:48:00] <+Kyma1020> what?
[0:48:00] <zaephia> no more HQ mats
[0:48:01] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt basically you get the xp in big bursts instead of fro individual mobs
[0:48:01] <penitentpendant> Pick Clean reigns
[0:48:02] <nicegrandmafingers> the exp change means new people dont have to kill every enemy in arr trash
[0:48:04] <KoyaMusa> no more gathered hq items
