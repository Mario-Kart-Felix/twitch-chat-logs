[0:36:37] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Next it's going to be "sit, high five, shake, speak, SUPLEX"
[0:36:43] <beetus_unlimited> Zangief will dance for your amusement if you provide compensation
[0:36:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> Zangief is going to end up being the genius of the family.

[0:38:44] <LorcaNomad> oh so it's like Fire emblem 1
[0:38:51] <%brickwall35> this is a roguelike?

[0:39:16] <beetus_unlimited> *far
[0:39:16] <+OwlLightningMage> This is a roguelike too.
[0:39:34] <+OwlLightningMage> it super doesn't look like a roguelike but it is
[0:39:35] <Tennochief> that's rad
[0:39:35] <+Jurani42> I think armor breaks only work when you damage their health
[0:39:42] <WyvernsArentDragons> the animations in this game are sick
[0:39:56] <%dekkitout> I dig how their moves are different ways of saying "cut"
[0:39:57] <DickieWoodsmall_279> vivisect is such a gross word

[0:42:07] <%BoxNavy> i would be alot more into this if it werent a roguelite. i like roguelites but this would be better suited to something with a clear start and end imo
[0:42:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> @VritraReiRei French, of course.
[0:42:34] <$RealThiele> X-Strike

[0:50:02] <$Wurmspawn> Based on just hopping in and someone mentioning Paige getting upset about Pat mentioning Xenogears, I'm assuming people have already made comparisons about level design's art style looking similar to the big environments like that tech shop earlier.
[0:50:06] <%mike2hands> JUSTIN??
[0:50:06] <arkv01> it's a... pat
[0:50:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> I swear the combination of heat and money make people in my state (California) fucking insane.

[0:51:55] <%juxtest> by the way you might want to start recording a message like this of your own
[0:52:00] <%Typhaeon> Really don't like how the sprites animate
[0:52:00] <+gamerform> god this just seems like an agonizingly drawn-out rpg
[0:52:05] <%brickwall35> ar-mah-da

[0:52:20] <arkv01> follow my lead into this opium den
[0:52:23] <donkymagooterson> ar mad ah
[0:52:24] <+OwlLightningMage> Time to take masturbation to the next level. Sex with alternative reality you.
[0:52:29] <%dekkitout> "If you fuckup, pass the baton"
[0:52:32] <%Saltmeisterr> its the same as into the breach
[0:52:32] <%AzureGale> It's like Into The Breach
[0:52:33] <%D00msDayDan> give dr zurek some red robes and she's literally a techpriest
[0:52:36] <$Caped_Eggy> oof
[0:52:37] <%Laecerelius> Time to cause galaxies to burn!
[0:52:39] <Louie_Salmon> Into the Breach is similarly futile
[0:52:40] <Torgue_1> So just like Into The Breach
[0:52:41] <%Typhaeon> General Totally Not a Bad Guy
[0:52:42] <dinnydanny777> "In one of these realities we have to win"
[0:52:43] <$RealThiele> so eventually youll get to our reality
[0:52:48] <beetus_unlimited> Do I HAVE to fuck my self?
[0:52:48] <LorcaNomad> just like into the breach! FeelsBadMan
[0:52:48] <+OwlLightningMage> It's just like Into the Breach
[0:52:53] <%asgard147> That's kinda FUCKED if you think about it... limesS
[0:52:54] <devanmuse> One failed run = an entire galaxy gets glassed
[0:53:03] <+caramelatte1> You;re Rick and mortying it basically
[0:53:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> So everytime you die, you doom a reality.
[0:53:08] <$RealThiele> Halso Reach every run
[0:53:09] <+Pyroclase> "We'll do better this time I swear"
[0:53:11] <+OwlLightningMage> That's wrong Pat
[0:53:13] <%AzureGale> Timelines in Into The Breach may as well be parallel dimensions :x
[0:53:15] <Daxalog> Into the breach uses timelines so the place you jump from is fucked
[0:53:18] <+OwlLightningMage> It's literally the same
[0:53:18] <DickieWoodsmall_279> Homoincesturbation (v) the act of engaging in sexual intercourse with oneself
[0:53:18] <WyvernsArentDragons> isn't this what the Combine does?
[0:53:19] <Louie_Salmon> I thought into the Breach was totally that also?
[0:53:22] <%Manic_f> Manic_f subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[0:53:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Your failure means a universe is fucked, get gud scrub.
[0:53:25] <donkymagooterson> so alternate timeline vs alternate reality
[0:53:25] <dinnydanny777> Whole point seems to be that if you have a 1/5000 chance and try a 5000 times, one day you'll win
[0:53:26] <+pectusumbra> no its parallel realities in Into The Breech as well
[0:53:26] <%BoxNavy> orc duty
[0:53:27] <%dekkitout> Oh boy-here I go killing!!!
[0:53:27] <%walternatorz> just believe some other parallel hero comes to save that universe
[0:53:29] <%Jaller101514> So its like part 7?
[0:53:30] <donkymagooterson> *dimension
[0:53:31] <Ner234> The fuck LUL
[0:53:32] <%Typhaeon> "Indiscriminately" is spelled incorrectly
[0:53:33] <beetus_unlimited> That’s what we call a whoopsie doodle
[0:53:34] <LorcaNomad> but that was what into the breach was, wasn't it? am I remembering wrong?
[0:53:34] <$RealThiele> oh boy
[0:53:37] <LordQuadly> Who wants to talk about Murder?! :D
[0:53:38] <+Jurani42> Krombopulous Michael?
[0:53:39] <+xeros720> i mean, you are in Into the Breach too, it's just that they don't clarify it isn't an alternate reality, even tho the existance of time travel posits there are
[0:53:40] <%BoxNavy> H A T E S
[0:53:42] <+Pyroclase> I still think the worst case of this is Bioshock Infinite, where the characters barely acknowledge that they even bailed on their original reality.
[0:53:46] <BakerBrute> What is this? An army of Cops?
[0:53:49] <+pectusumbra> Dark Elf
[0:53:51] <$RealThiele> Hi Vergil?
[0:53:57] <+pectusumbra> Dark Eldar I should say
[0:53:57] <+OwlLightningMage> @louie_salmon it is. You're right, Pat is wrong
[0:53:58] <%Laecerelius> Oh boy, time to go killing again!
[0:54:00] <RedHotBoss> this games so good. playin it right now and cant get enough of it
[0:54:06] <BoneofMalkav> He hates Heavy Weapons Guy Mains D:
[0:54:18] <+pectusumbra> " I really wanted to commit a war crime today. Against bleeding types, you know?"
[0:54:18] <arkv01> dark elves cannot resist the orc c-cock...
[0:54:35] <%juxtest> How many times has Justin done this already
[0:54:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> I hope there's a mechanic at the end that takes into the account how many realities got fucked.

I would say it's a Rogue-lite as it has no progression to help you in the long run, only new character unlocks. It can also be played 4 player co-op offline and on which is a nightmare!

[1:13:03] <+AsinPersuasion> zawa zawa zawa zawa
[1:13:06] <Valentinius_Anodyne> But this can't be Fire Emblem without the weird incest antichrist babies
[1:13:07] <LorcaNomad> so can you beat the game on the first run or is that super tough?
[1:13:10] <%dekkitout> Hey- I"M weak to antimatter too
[1:13:15] <%Parapattern> Just some rowdy boys
[1:13:17] <+Foxsploder> It seems like that would suck, losing so much to one death
[1:13:21] <%YakumoYomi> What about the "I'm my own grandpa" type of time baby incest?
[1:13:32] <%Piemono> You totally can beat the game on the 1st run
[1:13:32] <iamnuff> Ia also an weak to antimatter
[1:13:34] <KnightAsteran> is there progress between runs?
[1:13:42] <%YakumoYomi> Kermit
[1:13:56] <heartlesshealer> I don't think the time babies will run on Homestuck rules. Too much setup for a roguelike
[1:14:01] <+AsinPersuasion> did pat just have a stroke
[1:14:04] <MonsieurHonHon> whats the point then. its just an rpg with ironman always on lol

[1:16:26] <dapperskeleton69> time to empty the z targettable weakpoint
[1:16:27] <$realm_forge> This game uses the word cyber like 50’s sci-fi movies used the word space

[1:18:47] <RedHotBoss> I think I just got lucky I got an empath early. luck had alot to do with it I'm sure
[1:18:57] <+pectusumbra> So I do have a question: How random are your party members? Are they always the same or can you get different characters
[1:19:02] <%darwood_> darwood_ subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:19:03] <trithreat> does this game feel like it has enough longevity for multiple runs? thats the only thing I could see holding it back, purely due to the RPG style it's in
[1:19:07] <DonatelloJose> TEAM RIGHT
[1:19:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> go up

[1:20:17] <$realm_forge> Pat legit made me want to play Hades
[1:20:20] <RedHotBoss> attack the turn bar!
[1:20:36] <s1rcuit> @BoxNavy ok, thanks
[1:21:04] <Vyskus> hello Pat, hello chat, also hello to the multiple babies in ginger house
[1:21:12] <dr_sweets> Oh, this uses CTB like Final Fantasy X? Awesome
[1:21:38] <Vyskus> the animations in this are pretty dope
[1:22:18] <%Fooguwu> Hello pat, hello chat, hello dog and peach and cat!
[1:22:35] <+pectusumbra> I'll just pray that Renowned Explorers can get a shot this month/whatever this is
[1:22:38] <$realm_forge> I could fall asleep to this soundtrack
[1:22:59] <UnfilteredComic> This is like octopath but with good character animations too, looks incredible
[1:23:29] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You know, it's nice that the combat in this game is built around the tactic of delaying the enemies forever, since that's how I usually end up playing games where visible turn order is a thing
[1:23:30] <RedHotBoss> the boss tracks will wake you up
[1:23:38] <Vyskus> yeah the like, 3d 2d shit is pretty cool
[1:24:37] <%logoth_> Is his name NODO or NOOO
[1:24:44] <+fizzguy47> @valentinius_anodyne Until you can't delay them anymore
[1:24:56] <heartlesshealer> Is Paige controlling them?
[1:25:03] <+Jurani42> its good she tanky
[1:25:11] <Teyaric> The game has a front / back line system
[1:25:29] <heartlesshealer> ah, the row system explains it

[1:36:42] <%Monkeyweed21> this is just Octopath
[1:37:10] <+Pyroclase> But with MECHS
[1:37:24] <%Monkeyweed21> you only have 1 fight left @PatStaresAt
[1:37:33] <+Jurani42> you can level someone too
[1:37:38] <%dekkitout> Dimensional what!?
[1:37:46] <%Townspoon> what is this fluctuating view count about
[1:37:50] <%Townspoon> it scares me
[1:38:16] <%Ranryu692> it was at 200 something a few minutes ago, now it's at 640
[1:38:23] <+Jurani42> @Monkeyweed21 there's another day where he can do 3 more breaches
[1:38:28] <donkymagooterson> jumping by like 400-500 every few minutes
[1:38:29] <%Monkeyweed21> isn't your robot about to run out of power @PatStaresAt ?
[1:38:30] <1matheuw> overwétch
[1:38:30] <%BoxNavy> one day youll say a single word right
[1:38:35] <transporterthesequel> No I've noticed it too, it goes down to like 200 and then goes back up to 6 hundo.
[1:38:48] <Teyaric> The shield lady char can cancel overwatch
[1:38:50] <%Townspoon> view count sinks to like 500 viewers disappear and reappear every few mins
[1:39:03] <+Wasabreeze> I just finished my first run of this game the other day it’s great
[1:39:06] <%Townspoon> i tried googling it but got nothing
[1:39:08] <transporterthesequel> I think Twitch is fucking with THE MONEY Pat. PROTECT THE MONEY
[1:39:18] <heartlesshealer> view counts are just kinda fucked when you notice them
[1:39:49] <transporterthesequel> I mean they are, but they don't jump around in the hundreds, that's just odd.
[1:39:50] <Aydarkzero> this looks pretty good
[1:40:02] <%Monkeyweed21> So what are the odds that Micheal Ancel retired cuz he too is a huge rapist? or did he retire because he hates working with rapists?
[1:41:12] <+fizzguy47> what the hell, man
[1:41:28] <Make_me_mad> Feels really satisfying to fuck bosses up in this game.
[1:41:53] <OToole42> this game is dope
[1:41:53] <%SirGO0SE> "extra dna dynamic duo " thats what happens when the baby nut is twins
[1:41:54] <Make_me_mad> I beat two planets without dying so far, though, and it's got me nervous for when I inevitably get wrecked.
[1:41:56] <+Jurani42> note that items have level requirement
[1:42:01] <ghostravens> just came in. how's star renegades?
[1:42:02] <+AttleboroTaco> @PatStaresAt spent all day playing hades and finally got past the minotaur and his buddy
[1:42:20] <heartlesshealer> he was knighted before, so hopefully he just hates ubisoft and really loves animals for his new job, but yeah weird topic
[1:42:57] <%Monkeyweed21> @heartlesshealer yeah he seems nice so hopefully its nothing

[1:47:41] <butthurtdave> oh right this is free on Gamepass right now isnt it?
[1:48:00] <Teyaric> And GP just went up to 10 bucks. Mind yer budgets, folks.

[1:49:03] <SarahTsang> SarahTsang subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:49:15] <Make_me_mad> This game is very good from what I've seen of it, and I haven't even gotten into the real crazy stuff yet.
[1:49:50] <OperatorJo_> I'm so torn on this pixel art style NotLikeThis
[1:50:01] <Teyaric> Think like an SMT game, Pat - Are you better 50% buffing or using a weak attack?
[1:50:03] <rempai1> I'm getting major xcom vibes
[1:50:11] <Dreigun> I'm sold on the game's aesthetic and systems. Curious how the menuing and such feels though.
[1:50:52] <+HDmexiqtioner> Destroy the Child
[1:50:58] <Teyaric> 1 left on his stagger meter
[1:51:06] <butthurtdave> Is this a boss or regular enemy?
[1:51:06] <+Jurani42> he could only take 1 stagger there
[1:51:27] <%asgard147> HE'S TRYIN' TO RUN! KILL HIM!!!
[1:51:34] <Teyaric> This is an LT - think named orc. The Behemoths are the real bosses, and... They're all Fiend grade
[1:51:34] <devanmuse> gotta kill him this turn

[1:52:10] <+Jurani42> In the future you can save the stun for if they try to run
[1:52:23] <+Tarage> Yeah. Mitch McConnell has already said he'll confirm a Trump justice.
[1:52:27] <+Tarage> So the US is fucked.
[1:52:29] <Teyaric> Time for REAL facism. And violent rebellion. This is gonna get super unfun.
[1:52:37] <%AzureGale> Lasa blade
[1:52:39] <+Tarage> Good luck Canada.

[1:53:15] <heartlesshealer> Mitch McConnell just needs to drop dead already.
[1:53:45] <OToole42> nah, he's got all these young organs taken from unwilling victims
[1:54:30] <rempai1> where's the enemy hp bar?
[1:54:34] <butthurtdave> I'm still looking forward to that news headline of "Barr and McConnell both die in fiery crash into police station"

[1:57:46] <%Garthunox> Pat you should put PotD and HoH into the line up!
[1:57:59] <butthurtdave> Pat, what would you say is your favorite or best Roguelike on the market right now?
[1:58:00] <heartlesshealer> companion robot
[1:58:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> Comforting words? !SELF DELUSION!
[1:58:09] <Make_me_mad> Using cards on yourself can be a waste because you don't get the friendship points And those give BIG bonuses.
[1:58:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> Gun man wants to fuck the robot
[1:58:15] <%maenos2> FUCK THE ROBOT
[1:58:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> That side mouth tho

[1:58:58] <heartlesshealer> he good robot
[1:58:58] <%Garthunox> It's a polycule
[1:58:59] <%maenos2> THIS ROBOT IS A SLUT
[1:59:00] <+Pyroclase> "going to"
[1:59:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> If history has taught us anything, it's that people cannot wait to fuck robots.
[1:59:15] <Teyaric> This robots name is Damn 2020
[1:59:27] <%ha2ken> I'm not saying don't have sexy times with the robot but...have sexy times with the robot
[1:59:29] <%AzureGale> Wait, don't kill The Behemoth until they finish Pit People
[1:59:35] <OperatorJo_> Pat gon turn the brobot into a cumjar with legs NotLikeThis
[1:59:46] <%Monkeyweed21> wow pat fucked up
[1:59:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> to be fair I think there's probably a bluetooth fleshlight that confirmed Man's desire to fuck robots.
[1:59:59] <+fizzguy47> good luck pat
[2:00:04] <%Kitafin> a crying titan
[2:00:09] <BlindGato> TPK?
[2:00:12] <donkymagooterson> that's a proper mech that looks like it's going to kick your ass
[2:00:15] <SatoruMasamune> ...that mech looks like ED-209 fucked Metal Gear REX and had a robaby.
[2:00:20] <Teyaric> ARMOR BREAK
[2:00:37] <heartlesshealer> humans generally want to fuck everything
[2:00:49] <asurite_warrior> @PatStaresAt The main charaters sprite makes it look like shes really um bouncy
[2:01:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> Armor tits shouldn't bounce like that.
[2:01:30] <SatoruMasamune> If everything didn't want to get fucked by humans, then everything shouldn't have dressed so slutty.
[2:01:38] <Teyaric> She has no torso armor. It's a STR frame
[2:02:06] <%juxtest> Just a little napalm
[2:02:17] <+Wasabreeze> You really gotta play your stuns on this one
[2:03:14] <heartlesshealer> may want to buff your girl, idk
[2:03:23] <+fizzguy47> @teyaric It's basically the armour from that Tom Cruise movie
[2:03:38] <Teyaric> Yeah, she's 1000% the cast iron bitch
[2:03:43] <rufus2k2> A cape I see a robot with a cape!
[2:03:43] <heartlesshealer> yeah good thing you upped shields
[2:04:04] <Make_me_mad> Robot wizard with a cape is a great character.
[2:04:24] <devanmuse> i was gone for 5 minutes and suddenly he's fighting ed209
[2:04:26] <rufus2k2> oh and it's a friendly?! even better
[2:04:39] <Simonator7x> I love that robot wizard gives pamphlets to his god as buffs
[2:04:50] <braincraft> Sunder! Sunder! Sundercats! HOOOOOOOO
[2:04:53] <rufus2k2> to be fair he was fighting a BloodRaven like 10 minutes into the game
[2:05:15] <Make_me_mad> These missiles hurt a lot.
[2:05:54] <rufus2k2> man I need to see the character art for that wizard
[2:06:00] <rufus2k2> so cool
[2:06:13] <braincraft> My first time on the world 3 boss I got absolutely destroyed.
[2:06:21] <braincraft> Be careful about using Fortress.
[2:06:37] <Make_me_mad> There are a lot of very cool robots in this game.
[2:06:53] <Teyaric> The second behemoth was a major surprise. I'd favoured stun. It did not go well.
[2:07:09] <%DrHentaiPhD> goddamn this g*me is HOT
[2:07:19] <Make_me_mad> I found the second behemoth easier than this one, but also I'd gone full DPS.
[2:07:26] <%SarahTsang> I really like the art style to this game
[2:07:51] <Teyaric> Yeah, she's a total turtle-buster
[2:08:01] <rufus2k2> open that bitch up like tuna on a friday night
[2:08:07] <butthurtdave> oh is pat's box covering the party health?
[2:08:10] <Teyaric> COUNTER STANCE
[2:08:14] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> WutFace WutFace WutFace
[2:08:17] <rufus2k2> you better do something REAL fast
[2:08:17] <heartlesshealer> It's re-speccing!
[2:08:22] <+fizzguy47> @make_me_mad that one's basically a DPS race, two attacks per turn is bullshit
[2:08:28] <%juxtest> Strike him with your violence!
[2:08:34] <braincraft> Once you get the right high-level equipment it gets easier. Corruption can basically halve incoming damage.
[2:08:35] <+JonathLP> armor
[2:08:37] <+JonathLP> shield?
[2:08:39] <OToole42> counter attacks
[2:08:50] <%uncle_grumps> Git 'em!
[2:08:58] <+fizzguy47> read the card
[2:08:59] <braincraft> You start getting equipment that gives you like +74% to all damage.
[2:09:12] <Teyaric> Oh no
[2:09:14] <Teyaric> OH NOOOOOO
[2:09:35] <Make_me_mad> Wait, can you do spoiler text on twitch? I forget.
[2:09:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I like how the big robot/statue in the background subtly shifts depending on the camera angle
[2:10:14] <heartlesshealer> ...
[2:10:29] <+sleepy_coffee> Are ya winning
[2:10:32] <%BoxNavy> i guess
[2:10:33] <reonome> i feel ya mr mech
[2:10:34] <rufus2k2> your MOM is meaningless!
[2:10:36] <+fizzguy47> it's not
[2:10:36] <braincraft> The backgrounds are great.
[2:10:39] <%AzureGale> Prepare to be sent to the shadow realm
[2:10:45] <butthurtdave> is this another elite or a regular encounter?
[2:10:46] <braincraft> I like the world 2 boss stage.
[2:10:56] <braincraft> It's a boss.
[2:13:14] <Teyaric> BUFF ATK
[2:13:14] <heartlesshealer> bullet hell
[2:13:15] <butthurtdave> So anybody else see the Dragon's Dogma anime?
[2:13:20] <Make_me_mad> I bet that attack looks AWESOME.
[2:13:21] <%R3Roundabout> Time for enrage
[2:13:23] <%templar010> Kill it in one round
[2:13:29] <%asgard147> BULLET HELL limesS limesS limesS

[2:14:24] <rufus2k2> see, told you your mom was meaningless
[2:14:26] <%asgard147> Nice Job Pat! limesPat
[2:14:36] <rufus2k2> is that Bill from Left4Dead?1
[2:14:39] <fritz_dacat> VoHiYo
[2:14:45] <rufus2k2> they rebuilt him
[2:14:47] <ChungusQuest> My Emperor! I've faaiiiiiiled yoouuuuu!
[2:14:47] <Teyaric> Enforcer is trash for this team, Marksman is much better.
[2:14:59] <Make_me_mad> Marksmaaan.
[2:15:14] <rufus2k2> why does pat talk with a Faux texan accent
[2:15:22] <%aishman> How you liking the game so far @PatStaresAt ? I love the art style
[2:15:27] <Teyaric> Congratulations! now your new character will be lvl 1 and unable to use any gear for a while. :D
[2:15:33] <heartlesshealer> spend coin
[2:15:40] <%Saltmeisterr> HOT
[2:15:43] <Aydarkzero> how rad is it
[2:15:45] <%AzureGale> SUPER. SUPER.
[2:15:47] <WumFan64> He seems lukewarm on it so far
[2:15:49] <heartlesshealer> ROBOT
[2:15:52] <WyvernsArentDragons> the art is fantastic
[2:15:58] <Aydarkzero> cool robit
[2:15:58] <Teyaric> oh wow i thought it was guaranteed enforcer
[2:15:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> More robots!
[2:16:02] <%templar010> ...thats amazing
[2:16:04] <reonome> i would get it if it but I don't like the sci fi aesthetic :/
[2:16:10] <OperatorJo_> DAS A BROBOT RIGHT THER
[2:16:13] <heartlesshealer> Bye other choice
[2:16:13] <%BubbaRands> is it super duper?
[2:16:17] <butthurtdave> how many people can you have in a party?
[2:16:17] <Teyaric> ugh bently is a crap character tho
[2:16:22] <%UncleAWOL> UncleAWOL subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! Butts
[2:16:26] <Aydarkzero> maybe he'll be good!
[2:16:29] <%BubbaRands> DATS A COOL ROBO PogChamp
[2:16:31] <heartlesshealer> Uhh, shoulda kept that dna then I guess
[2:16:36] <heartlesshealer> good to know after bosses
[2:16:39] <kingra> Party members a party member.
[2:16:44] <+Wasabreeze> Bentley is the best
[2:16:45] <+pectusumbra> alright, I gotta get ready for bed, have a good night all
[2:16:51] <Teyaric> he's a counterhitter with stun-hits and middling armor. It's such a weird design.
[2:16:51] <+Wasabreeze> His armor damage is op
[2:16:52] <%DrHentaiPhD> GET BENT(ley)
[2:16:55] <+AceNugget> Gunslinger good, his nockback isabigafridge
[2:17:00] <+pectusumbra> I'll have to pick this up sometime soonish
[2:17:05] <heartlesshealer> yeah, that rifle has a 4 on it
[2:17:24] <+Jurani42> +armor is so good
[2:17:44] <Teyaric> Especially sicne almsot nothing heals it. Bently is one of the few that can tho
[2:17:48] <heartlesshealer> Bentley too look level for all the store items so he can't be selected
[2:17:52] <heartlesshealer> low*
[2:18:26] <heartlesshealer> oooh, I love this ship dining room
[2:18:29] <%AzureGale> Look at this team. They're going to do great!
[2:19:06] <butthurtdave> oof was expecting your party to full heal after clearing the level
[2:19:09] <%ArcanumArcanum> ArcanumArcanum subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! choese
[2:19:26] <WumFan64> who care
[2:19:31] <%Broand> Wow he got sucked into pats house
[2:19:36] <Teyaric> ..... Are all Nodo's interactions about smell?
[2:19:39] <%asgard147> Trash dimension limesS
[2:19:41] <heartlesshealer> preach to robot
[2:19:48] <Make_me_mad> The party did full heal.
[2:19:53] <%Monkeyweed21> is that Paige's hometown?
[2:19:58] <%templar010> Sucked into the Woolie Hole
[2:20:04] <%MelBrooksKA> Aka: The wooliehole
[2:20:06] <OperatorJo_> ^
[2:20:15] <heartlesshealer> beast robot appear
[2:20:21] <Teyaric> It's a Displacer Beast, actually.
[2:20:33] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt is there a Save & Quit function in this game?
[2:20:42] <%Monkeyweed21> Cybork
[2:21:00] <Teyaric> Cat, not dog.
[2:21:22] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[2:21:36] <Make_me_mad> Sometimes the RNG just says no.
[2:21:46] <%AzureGale> That's Star Renegades, baby
[2:22:01] <Make_me_mad> But look at that rad robo-skeleton in the background!
[2:22:11] <+fizzguy47> @vritrareirei yes, it saves from your last fight
[2:22:13] <VritraReiRei> I just realized there is only 648 viewers here. That makes me a little sad for this game ._.
[2:22:19] <Teyaric> Bently has STUN POWER. And counter-hits?
[2:22:25] <heartlesshealer> just make sure to keep bentley alive to level him
[2:22:33] <VritraReiRei> @fizzguy47 thanks, I would hate to have to do a whole run in one sitting
[2:23:08] <%Stormzcales_Lair> We Space pyrates are indeed awesome
[2:23:24] <Make_me_mad> Detonate is so good.
[2:23:29] <%asgard147> Self-Help Guru thank you very much! limesHeck
[2:23:30] <%juxtest> This is him at level 1?
[2:24:06] <braincraft> He's a fun little gun gremlin.
[2:24:06] <butthurtdave> pat do good
[2:24:07] <%Laecerelius> He stronk
[2:24:15] <+Clundy> Wow I really underestimated the sprites in this game
[2:24:16] <+fizzguy47> @vritrareirei that's mad lol
[2:24:21] <+Slefss> Big skillz
[2:24:26] <+Clundy> They’re really great
[2:24:27] <Aydarkzero> armor pierce!
[2:24:27] <Teyaric> AP Rounds is a SQUAD wide buff, btw
[2:24:39] <braincraft> He doesn't have the best damage, armor break, or pushback, but he's good at all of those things.
[2:24:57] <VritraReiRei> @fizzguy47 You used to have to do that for gungeon lol
[2:25:04] <Teyaric> If you're gonna make him tanky, put him up front, so he can get his counterswings in
[2:25:17] <braincraft> The shield guys are annoying, since they guard each other.
[2:25:17] <%barrakuta371> barrakuta371 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Hi Pat 6 months finally. Using my prime sub cause I can't really use it anywhere else. Keep it Rogue!
[2:25:19] <butthurtdave> kinda get the feeling gun guy is biggest concern
[2:25:27] <heartlesshealer> Batter
[2:25:30] <braincraft> He's actually not.
[2:25:39] <Make_me_mad> Shield guys are a-holes.
[2:25:41] <Teyaric> You'd be wrong. The shieldyboi is the deadliest. He /wrecks/ armor
[2:26:15] <braincraft> The rifle stormtroopers are tier-1 enemies. You walk over them on your way to lunch.
[2:26:18] <heartlesshealer> holy shit
[2:26:22] <usurper_sos> OOOF
[2:26:22] <%barrakuta371> That's a lot of damage!
[2:26:36] <Teyaric> Welcome to the real game.
[2:26:36] <%Bane_Kaikyo> woah
[2:27:01] <%MelBrooksKA> They just "Do-comboed" your ass
[2:27:12] <SirDogBear> That random soldier must be in charge of taking out traitors PogChamp
[2:27:19] <WyvernsArentDragons> I love all these ruined titans in the background
[2:27:45] <OToole42> Gives a very "Kill 6 Billion Demons" Vibe
[2:27:50] <OToole42> or Lancer
[2:27:53] <Teyaric> BTW - armor does not heal between battles. Good thing you got Bently.
[2:28:09] <braincraft> See, the rifle guy is only dangerous because he's hiding behind the two shield guys.
[2:28:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I mean, K6BD and Lancer have the same artist, but yeah, I agree
[2:29:05] <%AzureGale> MY ARMOR
[2:29:10] <heartlesshealer> high damage against shields, low damage against health? Stun baton basically?
[2:29:24] <OToole42> That was my point, his fantasy style, with the mecha
[2:29:30] <usurper_sos> You got some gains though
[2:29:31] <%asgard147> limesLUL
[2:29:34] <Aydarkzero> it's kind of weird seeing the map like this
[2:29:36] <%Ranryu692> everyone's favorite wrestler, Hornswoggle
[2:29:38] <Teyaric> Hornswaggle was the move that made me turn on Bently. He's a counter-hitter. With a "redirect to random ally" move???
[2:29:41] <%Saltmeisterr> i need to read k6bd
[2:29:46] <heartlesshealer> oh damn a sniper
[2:29:46] <%Saltmeisterr> it seems so cool
[2:30:03] <sonicblade38> why is there a dead EVA in the background?
[2:30:10] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Hey PAt. Thoughts on MonHun Rise?
[2:30:14] <Make_me_mad> Kill Six Billion Demons is now at like the tenth "Shit is getting real" phase. I love the escalation in that story.
[2:30:16] <braincraft> Hornswaggle is for when someone is about to get killed, and you need to redirect off of them right now.
[2:30:35] <Aydarkzero> @sonicblade38 cause it prob looks cool
[2:30:42] <braincraft> It's not as good as a proper tank, but it's better than nothing.
[2:30:54] <Teyaric> The hypest motherfucker, who punched an angel into trans-species and gender transformation, a feat most impossible, just went "OH SHIT EVACUATE" caus someone was on screen for one panel
[2:30:54] <OToole42> The main characters have had such a metamorphosis
[2:31:03] <sonicblade38> @Aydarkzero fair nuf
[2:31:33] <mortalmanbaby> im not to big on the art in this its cool but not as hype as it sounded on the podcast
[2:31:41] <braincraft> The angel punched herself into a new body.
[2:32:12] <heartlesshealer> sniper's got armor
[2:32:13] <Make_me_mad> A punch so rad you have to will a new body into existence to throw it.
[2:33:15] <braincraft> Robocleric is great. I hate plays when I can't have him on team.
[2:33:38] <Teyaric> I REALLY want a run with him and Barrier Maiden
[2:33:39] <braincraft> Also, Aegis is so good that you find yourself using her as a crutch.
[2:34:13] <%Saltmeisterr> are we gonna get to gungeon tonight?
[2:34:25] <braincraft> You can't go too heavy on support. I tried once and I didn't have enough damage to win fights. It just took forever to get ground down.
[2:34:53] <Teyaric> Just a bigger, slower discharge, of course
[2:34:53] <Cecion> god fist em
[2:35:14] <Teyaric> But it's a goddamn METEOR FIST of CELESTIAL FIRE
[2:35:23] <usurper_sos> LUL
[2:35:28] <+Arkfyre> MOLD 2
[2:35:30] <braincraft> Smash is Discharge, but with damage instead of pushback.
[2:35:30] <%BoxNavy> WutFace
[2:35:31] <%AzureGale> Is it sausages
[2:35:34] <butthurtdave> Peach is eating an xbox?
[2:35:36] <%afronooch> doo doo
[2:35:37] <%Laecerelius> It'll go well with all of that mold, glass, and poison she loves to eat
[2:35:38] <%StrawberryPantsu> That's just McDonald's
[2:35:40] <%TheWinged7> Is it fuzzy again?
[2:35:46] <SatoruMasamune> MAKE FUCKING SURE THERE'S NO MOLD
[2:35:48] <braincraft> Oh, yeah, get their social link up all the way!
[2:35:50] <%r0chelimit> is she eating durians?
[2:35:54] <heartlesshealer> Partners
[2:35:55] <braincraft> You unlock the best character!
[2:36:03] <wibbwobbler> fuzzy potatoes
[2:36:18] <leinadtonu> Wait, is Paige eating mold again?
[2:36:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That's an admirable goal
[2:36:22] <%Agami23> lol a smart toaster
[2:36:26] <%Laecerelius> Better watch out for Tech Priests
[2:36:27] <%AzureGale> Reincarnation
[2:36:30] <Vyskus> I wish I could be a smart toaster
[2:36:40] <AnneSQF> same. i just wanna toast all day
[2:36:57] <%MelBrooksKA> That overworld is adorable
[2:37:11] <heartlesshealer> Oh man and he's got a haymaker!
[2:37:13] <%Laecerelius> He gonna punch!
[2:37:17] <%BoxNavy> cool dude alert
[2:37:40] <%Bane_Kaikyo> HIM HAS BIG FISTO he gon paunch
[2:37:43] <OToole42> cataclysm or no balls
[2:37:48] <Mr_Strut> It's like doomguy fucked the hulk
[2:37:52] <SirDogBear> That giant robot got a menacing pink aura!
[2:38:13] <%justcallmebobplease> Cripes every moment of this I watch makes me jones harder for whenever this hits Switch.
[2:38:19] <wibbwobbler> haymaker or bust
[2:38:22] <heartlesshealer> Cataclysm seems like a Dual Tech
[2:38:28] <OToole42> Slayer Hulk? Hulk Guy, Doom Hulk?
[2:38:39] <braincraft> The punchbots are rough. They GO FAST.
[2:38:50] <heartlesshealer> nice!
[2:39:07] <%barrakuta371> WOW psaBig psaUp
[2:39:07] <braincraft> DUAL TECH!
[2:39:18] <butthurtdave> OOOOF
[2:39:39] <%justcallmebobplease> Raw Fury still hasn't given any release date information for consoles other than 'this year', right?

[2:42:50] <%AzureGale> I mean that's what happens when you eat bad-smelling stuff
[2:43:59] <LorcaNomad> every debuff under the sun and he still got tons of hp lol
[2:43:59] <%Piemono> Blitz is for delaying
[2:44:13] <%RyTYoung> I just beat the Hydra in Hades for the first time hell yeah!
[2:44:39] <wibbwobbler> 1 tough cookie
[2:44:49] <SirDogBear> stun PogChamp
[2:45:23] <Make_me_mad> Having your character defend against a stunned enemy's attack. Smart.
[2:45:30] <butthurtdave> tf was that
[2:45:30] <heartlesshealer> 54 dna
[2:46:04] <%Moave> hello?
[2:46:05] <heartlesshealer> You can stash
[2:46:10] <devanmuse> we aren't doing gungeon tonight are we?
[2:46:22] <%Moave> oh shit it worked
[2:46:30] <heartlesshealer> now you can equip the sord
[2:46:45] <%Moave> Yo taking pat's advice I ended using streamlinks
[2:46:49] <%Moave> This thing is great
[2:47:00] <%Moave> Or wait
[2:47:18] <%Moave> I should clarify. Pats advice to say fuck amazon and it's adds
[2:47:25] <$Dakuu75> REALLY TWITCH?! (I just got a god damn Trojan condom ad, as I walked in here.)
[2:47:34] <heartlesshealer> Pat, equip sword now she's leveled up
[2:48:07] <@SoFarFetched> Can probably do adblock to avoid that dakuu
[2:48:29] <%Moave> I am using streamlinks and the twitch gui for it
[2:48:38] <OToole42> ublock origin, and privacy badger help too
[2:48:39] <$Moave> runs great
[2:48:46] <%Moave> just a pain to setup
[2:48:49] <OToole42> as does Ghosterly
[2:48:59] <%Moave> ghosterly?
[2:49:09] <%Moave> what is that?
[2:49:16] <OToole42> yeah, prevents ad companies from tracking you
[2:49:28] <$Dakuu75> I have 2 different add-blocks for my browser. twitch pre-rolls always seem to go through though
[2:49:39] <OToole42> also blocks some ads and anti ad blockers
[2:50:24] <%Moave> streamlink gives me no ads at all, just takes a bit to get used to and has a barebones UI
[2:50:35] <Kurrisum> game worth?
[2:50:38] <OToole42> I run all three, and it's very very rare something gets through
[2:51:02] <OToole42> only time it causes issues if I'm in a chat with a lot of emote spam, and it's checking each comment for links
[2:51:11] <%Moave> Remember when adblocker bocked ads, until they got bought out by amazon (i think)
[2:51:17] <OToole42> or checking emote images for ads
[2:51:24] <OToole42> was so sad
[2:51:31] <%Moave> sad
[2:51:34] <OToole42> went from best to worst in a day
[2:51:49] <+antthefool> Oh this looks neat
[2:51:59] <butthurtdave> then there's all the sites that detect your adblock and are like "HEY DISABLE IT FUCKFACE"
[2:52:04] <wibbwobbler> e p i c b r u h m o m e n t
[2:52:08] <%CzeekyPlays> Is UBlock still alright
[2:52:09] <Cecion> any game over yet?
[2:52:10] <$RealThiele> Mister DNA
[2:52:12] <Make_me_mad> SEVER IS REALLY GOOD
[2:52:14] <+antthefool> This looks really neat
[2:52:22] <butthurtdave> lowest first?
[2:52:25] <OToole42> and then you use the ublock element picker to wipe away the anti ad banner
[2:52:50] <butthurtdave> wait what happen

[2:55:38] <$Dakuu75> Man, I like her mech-suit. I'm a big fan of those Ripley-suits and Dexter's Lab mechs
[2:56:30] <heartlesshealer> hmm, better use that full health station after this if it's still available
[2:56:45] <braincraft> It's a little chonkier than the Edge of Tomorrow exoskeletons.
[2:57:11] <braincraft> But not quite as chonky as the Ripley suit.
[2:57:21] <%Laecerelius> Big chonky boi right here

[3:19:47] <braincraft> By "guard" it means when one unit is defending another.
[3:19:52] <heartlesshealer> time for heal box
[3:19:52] <braincraft> Which is pretty good, because that's annoying.
[3:19:57] <TrollKing96> Does levelling up heal?
[3:19:58] <fritz_dacat> BegWan you did it
[3:20:13] <%darwood_> this game is tight
[3:20:22] <braincraft> Yeah, it's really dire when it's time to pick your fifth party member and it's two more backliners.
[3:20:55] <%BoxNavy> yo
[3:20:56] <Teyaric> Bentley CAN frontline if you've got tons of gear for him

[3:22:54] <$RealThiele> mold evolves slowly
[3:22:56] <%BoxNavy> FEAST ON VISCERA
[3:22:59] <heartlesshealer> Paige, you can spend time talking shit at Pat and distracting him from playing good
[3:22:59] <%Laecerelius> Big damage, big armor break
[3:23:01] <%barrakuta371> Wow this boss is no joke
[3:23:02] <Make_me_mad> Yeah you wanna not get hit by that.
[3:23:07] <usurper_sos> nobody expects Viscera
[3:23:08] <braincraft> Just Blitz him, it should knock him all the way back.
[3:23:09] <Teyaric> remember- never stun her unless you like giant counters
[3:23:16] <braincraft> Then you can do Cleaves.
[3:23:16] <heartlesshealer> Vore is banned
[3:23:21] <wibbwobbler> peach is paige
[3:24:03] <ChangelingBard> Stab the Monster!
[3:24:15] <braincraft> Also, once you have its shields down, use AP ammo. It does tons of damage!
[3:24:43] <%BoxNavy> i thought Feast On Viscera was its name
[3:24:53] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, use Bentley's armor piercing rounds once you're doing direct health damage
[3:25:38] <%crimsonharvest> use x strike or whatever
[3:25:52] <%Piemono> Don't stun this dude
[3:26:16] <braincraft> Broadside does more damage, you should use it when you can.
[3:26:28] <%BoxNavy> stun him and see what happens :)
[3:26:33] <Captkindawesome> Stun if you want to lose
[3:26:39] <braincraft> Yeah, sometimes he just stabs you out of turn for the fuck of it.
[3:26:49] <$RealThiele> FFXIV *NEED ROLE - TANK* 15 min queue
[3:26:51] <wibbwobbler> mtn. dew game fuel for the soul
[3:26:54] <heartlesshealer> Perforate doesn't sound good
[3:26:54] <%Piemono> He attacks twice
[3:27:03] <Teyaric> the boss details DO say attacks twice a turn
[3:28:11] <heartlesshealer> time for AP rounds
[3:28:42] <%Piemono> NO
[3:28:52] <%barrakuta371> what
[3:30:06] <+fizzguy47> DPS check boss
[3:30:19] <heartlesshealer> oh no
[3:30:28] <%uncle_grumps> GIT 'EM!
[3:30:48] <wibbwobbler> shield down noise sounds like dmc sound effect
[3:30:50] <heartlesshealer> yes take away that armor and push him out
[3:31:37] <braincraft> Just wait for the other bosses, they're even meaner.
[3:31:59] <braincraft> Interestingly, Battlecry gives the party a damage buff, so it's useful even when you don't need a taunt.
[3:32:07] <%Fooguwu> BibleThump BibleThump
[3:32:11] <heartlesshealer> Bentley... BibleThump

[3:32:50] <jcflyguy> So... what carries over?

[3:35:52] <%Piemono> it goes away after the mission
[3:35:55] <VritraReiRei> Wait, he clicked out of it too fast, how do your clear permanent injuries?
[3:36:07] <%Taisuru> LOOKS COOL THO
[3:36:10] <braincraft> Basically every time you get a party full heal.
[3:36:11] <EternalJedi> complete the mission
[3:36:12] <reonome> health station
[3:36:13] <%Agami23> yeah this is bizzare.
[3:36:13] <EternalJedi> meaning the planet

[3:36:15] <heartlesshealer> idk we'll have to research or catch the vod
[3:36:17] <%Agami23> but radical
[3:36:18] <kingra> This is not very Rougelikey.
[3:36:19] <%Piemono> Complete mission @VritraReiRei
[3:36:23] <Make_me_mad> You basically do your upgrading between game-overs.
[3:36:23] <kingra> Still good tho
[3:36:24] <OperatorJo_> "run"
[3:36:29] <Make_me_mad> As far as the stuff that actually carries over.
[3:36:30] <+Dova573> it feels like its well worth the money
[3:36:32] <%BoxNavy> shouldnt have even been a roguelike
[3:36:32] <%aishman> This game still looks amazing
[3:36:33] <heartlesshealer> look at new party members then quit?
[3:36:34] <+dmtjinni> nice music tho
[3:36:35] <Captkindawesome> Pick new party member first!
[3:36:36] <heartlesshealer> nvm
[3:36:39] <devanmuse> roguelike JRPG
[3:36:42] <EternalJedi> kingra the runs are long, but there are roguelink things
[3:36:43] <Frogwash> Roguelike needs to be rebranded
[3:36:49] <OldCrow11> runs are real long, it's a lot of fun in the tactics though
[3:36:53] <Teyaric> dozens??????
[3:36:58] <%BoxNavy> sick clapping pat
[3:37:01] <EternalJedi> you just gotta die before the roguelike stuff shows
[3:37:01] <+dmtjinni> We Staired with you Pat

[3:37:05] <%BoxNavy> ok :)
[3:37:07] <%Saltmeisterr> did pat die?
[3:37:07] <%asgard147> not too bad limesOk
[3:37:08] <Teyaric> I saw like 10ish on the party select...
[3:37:10] <%ClericOfSparda> nice
[3:37:14] <$RealThiele> bullet boi OP with sword
[3:37:16] <Make_me_mad> If you max social links between characters you can get their quantum-displaced kids that combine their classes.
[3:37:25] <braincraft> There's like a dozen actual characters, and they each have a few palette swaps.
[3:37:29] <Make_me_mad> There's a lot of weird combo-characters to unlock.
[3:37:34] <Teyaric> ahhhh
[3:37:53] <heartlesshealer> they combine classes? So we can get robotic sword priest?
[3:37:54] <braincraft> Robo-cleric x Sword Girl gives you a pretty fun character.
[3:38:02] <braincraft> Yes.
[3:38:04] <Make_me_mad> Not to mention upgrades for your drone dude.
[3:38:06] <braincraft> Kinda.
[3:38:10] <Make_me_mad> To make the overworld exploration better.
[3:38:10] <heartlesshealer> nice
[3:38:15] <heartlesshealer> still nice
[3:38:19] <braincraft> They're not exactly a combination of their parents, they have their own schtick.
[3:38:28] <Make_me_mad> It's fairly extensive and pretty cool.
[3:38:29] <Teyaric> I maxed han solo x cast iron bitch and was surprised at no kid
[3:38:33] <OldCrow11> palette swaps that rearrange the order you get abilities in and sometimes give new abilities
[3:38:57] <%Reevesypoo> Reevesypoo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! 2 more to go for 2 years give zangief and elmo tons of pats for me!
[3:38:59] <braincraft> And sometimes change your health pool a little.
[3:39:11] <heartlesshealer> ah, okay
[3:39:14] <Teyaric> so does that mean you can have a party of sword welders for example?
[3:39:16] <braincraft> Like, a variant gives you less shields but you get an AoE earlier.
[3:39:35] <braincraft> It makes it tough to equip them, but sure.
[3:39:44] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[3:39:47] <braincraft> They all have to fight over sword drops.
[3:40:06] <braincraft> I like the Gunslinger and Assassin.
[3:40:08] <Teyaric> I'm just pondering shield squad now
[3:40:26] <braincraft> Don't go too hard on defense, you need some damage to win fights.
[3:40:50] <braincraft> I tried a party of nothing but Aegis and supports, and I died because all they could do was tank hits.
[3:40:53] <OldCrow11> yeah, the 2 weapon characters are powerful but are also equipment hogs
[3:41:04] <Teyaric> and longer runs get to 6 chars in a squad?
[3:41:22] <braincraft> Well, 5. The sixth character is an escort mission.

[3:52:47] <Retrash> you lose the sword beam if you're not at full hp
[3:52:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Like Zelda

[4:01:01] <Djinnazz> You got a shield, your fine
[4:01:03] <+TheShisno> Yari Launcher or bust
[4:01:03] <%Saltmeisterr> it has a fun gimmick
[4:01:26] <%Saltmeisterr> oooh i like the yari launcher too
[4:01:28] <Profmcstevie> Pat if you clench for every room 3 runs of this game will give you buns of steel
[4:01:35] <%Saltmeisterr> but it has suck limited ammo
[4:01:56] <$floralkami> .... i just realized how dumb "wash away the rain" is... I've been wrong for 15+ years
[4:02:01] <Mrchiselfist> The Yari Launcher is terrifying
[4:02:18] <+TheShisno> But let's be real
[4:02:18] <$RealThiele> Blackhole sun is better on drugs
[4:02:22] <+TheShisno> The real king
[4:02:26] <+TheShisno> Is the Casey
[4:02:28] <SatoruMasamune> C L E N C H
[4:02:29] <%Saltmeisterr> also black hole launcher isn't cheating
[4:02:32] <krabthecrab> Grunge is better on drugs
[4:02:34] <%Parapattern> When do we get the freakin GUNS?!
[4:02:35] <%Saltmeisterr> GUNTHER is cheating
[4:02:39] <Djinnazz> 30 rounds is more than enough to clear en entire floor though
[4:02:43] <$RealThiele> oh man i cant wait for that reprint
[4:03:00] <ergulor> the poopulons are trash
[4:03:02] <Djinnazz> Gunther is a givin
[4:03:10] <+TheShisno> Also, Ser Junken is the goodest boy
[4:03:11] <%Saltmeisterr> that gun is so stoopid good
[4:03:22] <$Invlux> Casey, or I call it, the run ender I can't refuse
[4:03:26] <CursedNobleman> biggest problem with gungeon is that dps is so trash for a tonna weapons
[4:03:29] <wibbwobbler> GUNGEON=GUN DUNGEON

[4:15:18] <%AzureGale> ORN
[4:15:18] <+TheShisno> BRT
[4:15:30] <%Laecerelius> I forgot about his backwards shots
[4:15:37] <%MegboyManuel> this is an incredible weapon set ngl
[4:15:41] <%Piemono> It so hard for me to not just keep using the sword on the bulled
[4:15:43] <Profmcstevie> You are THE most stressed 5 health 7 armour person in the world
[4:15:47] <%Saltmeisterr> oh wow that synergizes well with backup hun
[4:15:49] <+MisterAvry> What's this? A gungeon woefully underpopulated by BEES? My missile launcher full of BEES ought to put an end to that!
[4:15:49] <zugzwane> my do you have a jammed?
[4:16:03] <%Saltmeisterr> wait how did pat get cursed?
[4:16:09] <+TheShisno> What cursed stuff did he get? Cause I notice the gun nut is jammed
[4:16:12] <%AzureGale> He only gets sword beams at full health soooooooo...
[4:16:18] <benjiFG> there's always jammed enemies on this chamber
[4:16:23] <$Invlux> backwards homing rocket Kreygasm
[4:16:24] <Retrash> that room layout always has that enemy jammed, he doesn't have curse
[4:16:28] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt when was the last time you played this game? You are SUPER good at this
[4:16:41] <$RealThiele> x-bow hits reasonably hard
[4:17:03] <VritraReiRei> practicing before stream, eh? :D
[4:17:04] <%Saltmeisterr> no theres more jammed enemies
[4:17:05] <+Itselguapo> could feed the crossbow to something
[4:17:09] <$Invlux> it's good to have a warm up before streaming gungeon lol
[4:17:20] <%Saltmeisterr> is it one of his passives?
[4:17:33] <tolloponik> did this game recently get an update or is that a character you get when you beat the game
[4:17:51] <$RealThiele> Gungeons and Drayguns update i think
[4:17:54] <%Saltmeisterr> its a character u unlock
[4:17:55] <+PirateKefka> Bullet's been in since launch, IIRC. He's an unlockable
[4:18:09] <Profmcstevie> 4 unlockable characters, all rad
[4:18:10] <%Piemono> @tolloponik you have to unlock him
[4:18:18] <ClarentMordred> he has some fairly specific criteria to unlock him
[4:18:20] <%Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt did u pick up a cursed item?
[4:18:51] <$Invlux> jammed enemies just show up in this zone
[4:18:59] <VritraReiRei> @Saltmeisterr this level has guaranteed Jammed
[4:19:13] <%Saltmeisterr> oh huh i never knew that
[4:19:23] <benjiFG> remember to check the walls of chest rooms for the free chest
[4:19:29] <+Pars_Librum> I like to blow up any low tier chests I find in the hopes of getting Ser Junkan
[4:19:35] <ClarentMordred> this floor just kinda sucks lol yeah
[4:19:41] <%AzureGale> Better the blanks than your armor
[4:19:48] <Djinnazz> Pff
[4:20:08] <$Invlux> yeah, if there's any chests I don't open by the end of the floor I just break em
[4:20:09] <+skylerpilot> my armor!
[4:20:32] <%Ne1son> yeye
[4:20:37] <devanmuse> what happens if he gets hit? i know his sword will stop shooting lasers, but what else?
[4:20:41] <$RealThiele> plasma cannon
[4:20:48] <$Invlux> ooh
[4:20:49] <%AzureGale> The predator doesn't turn you invisible, what a piece of junk. jk
[4:20:52] <%Saltmeisterr> that gun can let u steal pat
[4:21:00] <SatoruMasamune> PHASED PLASMA RIFLE IN THE 40 WATT RANGE
[4:21:03] <$RealThiele> the predator DOEs turn you invis
[4:21:12] <%Saltmeisterr> it does @AzureGale
[4:21:13] <$RealThiele> when you reload
[4:21:15] <+TheShisno> Speen
[4:21:20] <ergulor> time to see pat's ass kicked beyond the grave
[4:21:21] <benjiFG> when you reload an empty mag
[4:21:21] <Retrash> reload an empty clip
[4:21:24] <%Saltmeisterr> u have to empty it
[4:21:24] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt when you reload an empty clip
[4:21:29] <%Taisuru> Empty
[4:21:30] <$RealThiele> its gotta be an empty clip
[4:21:33] <usurper_sos> reload at empty
[4:21:36] <$RealThiele> go fight
[4:21:39] <%AzureGale> I stand corrected
[4:21:48] <%Laecerelius> Neato
[4:21:53] <$Invlux> this boss is a SHIT
[4:21:57] <VritraReiRei> Time to STEAL :D
[4:21:59] <%Saltmeisterr> this guy is though
[4:22:06] <SatoruMasamune> Neato burrito, even.
[4:22:09] <+PirateKefka> Old King is a fuck
[4:22:32] <$Invlux> i usually skip this floor lol
[4:22:34] <LoadingFWANK> everyone does fuck that king
[4:22:42] <benjiFG> i always use the sword to erase bullets on bosses and then switch back to whatever gun
[4:22:48] <$RealThiele> sword to clear bullets
[4:22:50] <zugzwane> i havent beaten him yet
[4:22:52] <%Saltmeisterr> but the free synergy chest tho
[4:22:54] <VritraReiRei> At least there is no Master Round so you arent pressured to Perfect it
[4:23:01] <+Pars_Librum> Sword is super useful for this fight, defense-wise

[4:35:35] <%Saltmeisterr> fuck em
[4:35:39] <ergulor> the easiest
[4:35:39] <$RealThiele> not that he needs much else
[4:35:50] <McAngrimStein> kill pillars are the most annoying, I'll take any of this floor's bosses over them
[4:35:51] <$Invlux> kill pillars will probably be easy with the shit Pat is running
[4:35:55] <Cecion> Kill Pillars die to Stinger
[4:36:05] <$Invlux> he can roll through bullets to clear them
[4:36:10] <ClarentMordred> mineflayer is floor 3 isnt it
[4:36:16] <VritraReiRei> Mine Flayer is Floor 3 boss

[4:36:40] <%Monkeyweed21> you mean high priest
[4:36:44] <+Dova573> Gun priest
[4:36:50] <zugzwane> high priest is easy if the boss room has pillars

[4:37:53] <+MisterAvry> ez pz
[4:38:02] <%cowardlord> NICE
[4:38:06] <%Fooguwu> YOU DEFEATED
[4:38:07] <+Dova573> The tip for that last attack is to roll into the circle
[4:38:11] <+atin2000> I know he wants to kill the past... but this might be better used killing the lich
[4:38:21] <+TheShisno> Thunk thunk thunk
[4:38:22] <$Invlux> has Pat gotten all 5 rounds in 1 run before?
[4:38:28] <Clear_Truth> good job man!
[4:38:34] <mastermidget23> this is the most busted non rainbow run I have ever seen.
[4:38:37] <$floralkami> oh, i thought some trap beat was about to start...
[4:38:45] <+TheShisno> Does the grenade launcher have any synergy that makes it a rotary launcher?
[4:38:50] <$Invlux> WELL
[4:38:54] <%xcompleasedad> FLIP TABLE
[4:38:56] <+Dova573> WUT

[4:39:05] <$RealThiele> with 12 health?
[4:39:07] <%Monkeyweed21> ???
[4:39:11] <%Saltmeisterr> lich is kinda easy
[4:39:11] <Louie_Salmon> If any run was gonna do it blind, this would have a good shot
[4:39:16] <%Taisuru> Haven't you put a gorillion hours into this?
[4:39:17] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt have you ever gotten the 5 Master Round achievement?
[4:39:18] <gluemanofficial> It's hard to kill somebody you can't see. Maybe if you had artillery
[4:39:19] <%Monkeyweed21> THIS IS THE RUN TO DO IT
[4:39:24] <%Saltmeisterr> bullet hell on the other hanf'
[4:39:28] <Vyskus> hell yeah, gungeon
[4:39:29] <%Piemono> Lich might be easy than the past at this point
[4:39:31] <$Invlux> just get the chamber gun... easy
[4:39:42] <%xcompleasedad> Flip Table
[4:39:44] <+Dova573> Yeah the lichs floor is worse than the litch itself
[4:39:47] <benjiFG> the item that achievement gives you is terrible
[4:39:49] <Profmcstevie> You have enough health and armour to breach Helms Deep pat, you'll do fine
[4:39:52] <Djinnazz> @louie_salmon depends on how well bullet hell goes.
[4:39:58] <%Mdub98> Mdub98 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[4:40:01] <McAngrimStein> Resourceful Rat is tougher than 5 master round imo
[4:40:02] <+Pars_Librum> Yes, I actually do have that one
[4:40:04] <%Saltmeisterr> yeah what Dova said
[4:40:10] <%Piemono> you can just ignore those little zombie dudes that run at you, they can't hurt bullet
[4:40:28] <%Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt if u can get through bullet hell u can beat the lich
[4:40:29] <SatoruMasamune> PAT, JUST DON'T FORGET THAT A SINGLE HIT WILL BYPASS ALL YOUR HEARTS, ARMOR, AND BLANKS TO NOT ONLY KILL YOU AND END THE RUN, BUT ERASE YOUR SAVE DATA FOR ALL TIME AND PREVENT YOU FROM EVER PROGRESSING AGAIN
[4:40:33] <benjiFG> yes
[4:40:37] <$RealThiele> Fus Roh Dah presumeably

[4:42:15] <+TheShisno> Okay what the shit
[4:42:21] <+MisterAvry> oh good, they were taking so long
[4:42:23] <McAngrimStein> I think you can still cheat the 5 master rounds, or rather you get a much better shot if you get a Clone run
[4:42:24] <AFlyingTaco1> Is it passive or do you have to activate it?
[4:42:29] <ergulor> yup
[4:42:29] <$Invlux> YEAH

[4:48:42] <+Dova573> or until I get stuck or I finsih a game
[4:48:42] <Profmcstevie> Wiki diving a roguelike is weird, I feel like there's a threshold to allow it
[4:48:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> I actually enjoy surprises, so no.
[4:48:49] <Louie_Salmon> Even then, there's too much to wiki-dive
[4:48:59] <whitebatsy> Only if the game doesn't tell what stuff do
[4:49:08] <incredibleCrayon> This game is really neat
[4:49:16] <%brickwall35> I mean not immediately wiki diving, but once you play extensively
[4:49:26] <$Invlux> this run is fucking stupid, i love it
[4:49:32] <%brickwall35> like no way are you randomly throwing a round into the home
[4:49:43] <%Saltmeisterr> i feel like gungeon has the best variety out of any roguelike

[5:04:12] <%Saltmeisterr> @Monkeyweed21 he's never been to bullet hell tho
[5:04:24] <$Invlux> yeah, he wouldn't have gotten it anyways
[5:04:37] <$Invlux> need to have all 5 on you at once
[5:04:39] <Louie_Salmon> Oh yeah if you trade in the first that might not count
[5:04:47] <VritraReiRei> @McAngrimStein naw, they dont even have to be unique so you can have 2 Master Round 1s and it works
[5:04:49] <Robot_Nixon_> LUL
[5:04:51] <+TheShisno> No
[5:04:53] <%Saltmeisterr> nah
[5:04:53] <McAngrimStein> or at least I think you need to have 5 rounds period
