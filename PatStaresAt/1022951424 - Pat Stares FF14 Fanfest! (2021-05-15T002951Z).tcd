[0:07:23] <%thelaxinator> probably a two handed class, based on that scene with Zenos
[0:07:24] <+REDtheBEAST> Geomancer

[0:07:36] <+azacca_bitter> Jannissary?
[0:07:36] <SweetCuppingCake> NIN also doesn’t share gear
[0:07:36] <BigNerdSam> It will neither of those, it will be Big Stepper and it will fight by stepping on enemies.
[0:07:37] <2DSuperiority> Sage job trainer is already in Limsa, and that's where Corsair would start
[0:07:38] <+BIumen> @PatStaresAt a scythe is a VERY curved sword
[0:07:39] <BoxNavy> the 5.3 trial boss literally does the spellsword stuff
[0:07:40] <%AllenDeadman> New class... MOON KILLER
[0:07:42] <+abrupt_abe> What if it's neither?
[0:07:42] <%Hobojo153> Mystic Knight is just Red Mage
[0:07:42] <BoSteed> Zenos is probably going to be the new class, so I'm guessing scythe.
[0:07:43] <FuzzTime> Judge?!
[0:07:43] <Kojir0555> Magic hammer!!!
[0:07:48] <$Futurecity10> Paladin has thousands of curved swords
[0:07:48] <aeonicvector> but gunbreaker is a sword dps :)
[0:07:49] <%transporterthesequel> How about Soldier, so I can have OTHER big sword
[0:07:51] <orbulon> just play paladin lol
[0:07:53] <%jorniev> CORSAIRE WOULD BE COOL
[0:07:53] <ZedSlayer> what about rogue or ninja, those are like, small sword?
[0:07:53] <Tukaru> Paladins have curved swords, also katana
[0:07:53] <%JoshManVGH> So Mystic Knight would be DPS Paladin right?
[0:07:53] <BoxNavy> Kreygasm BERSERKER
[0:07:55] <+bad_luck_luke> just play paladin

[0:10:30] <%Nobrev> as a RDM main I think the only thing I can think of is upgrading verstone/veraero to verglare and verdia and verfire/verthunder to something like verfoul and ver whatever else BLM has
[0:10:31] <%transporterthesequel> Living Dead is Benediction
[0:10:32] <$Futurecity10> Thats a problem only for Savage end game content
[0:10:34] <sandwichpeddler> Do they usually go straight into the new trailer during the fanfest livestreams?
[0:10:35] <+Medrex> I could go for some more situational party buffs for dancer? more chances to save a trial from wiping?

[0:10:37] <%kainhighwind1990> How about some kind of skill that takes away your hp for a stronger attack like Cecil's thing in 4?
[0:10:39] <%Alazull> That would make it more in line with other tank abilities
[0:10:39] <%JoshManVGH> Man how is sage going to deal with Living Dead?
[0:10:43] <bashful_bard> Or just make LD give invuln for 10 seconds

[0:16:45] <LeonDragonheart> Pat what is your stance on the PVP style combo buttons?
[0:16:45] <+FluffNir> FluffNir subscribed with Prime. 
[0:16:46] <%DEETRz> some skills need to get pruned tbh
[0:16:46] <metalsiren31> Dark Knight could use ONE more button
[0:16:49] <%Kiso52> @PatStaresAt Do you think storms eye for warrior should have its animation better looking? because it looks so goofy compared to other tanks.
[0:16:50] <%Mendin> Pat what will you do if the new class is Geomancer
[0:16:50] <afronooch> true
[0:16:51] <Forester_Skippy> lvl 90 trait LD doesnt kill me
[0:16:52] <walternatorz> My controller cross macros will thank SE if they don't add abilities
[0:16:52] <%lucky_icarus> GNB cant handle more buttons!
[0:16:53] <%Nobrev> agreed
[0:16:54] <Sausious> I main Paladin, there's WAY TOO MANY buttons right now
[0:16:59] <%dankgerald> New bard music
[0:16:59] <%valriot> They can turn abilities into NEW ones though
[0:17:00] <HawkHollywood> holy hell I never knew DRK had an animation update and the previous ones look so cool why did they change it @patstaresat
[0:17:01] <2DSuperiority> Controller players running out of buttons LUL
[0:17:01] <yukin0tora> 1 or 2 new buttons is fine
[0:17:04] <T_Sasquatch> I want an entirely new combo for monk tbh
[0:17:04] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@Monkeyweed21) (warning)
[0:17:08] <onetrueking27> i want a zantetsuken button for GNB

[0:17:15] <BigNerdSam> GOODBYE CLEMENCY AND SHIELD BASH
[0:17:15] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> PLD is like the easiest tank job tho
[0:17:16] <Sausious> ITS TOO MUCH

[0:17:19] <+azacca_bitter> scholers gonna get wrecked
[0:17:20] <Lupinzee> just turn bard into I-No plz
[0:17:20] <%JoshManVGH> Will WAR get more buttons?
[0:17:20] <%Monkeyweed21> nah
[0:17:21] <%transporterthesequel> Paladin's rotation is a fuckin mess
[0:17:21] <Macguffn> I want them to lower skill aquisition level so my friends will shut up about how long it takes to get full rotation
[0:17:23] <%valriot> They might turn Goring into 1 button but that's it
[0:17:23] <%ConLin_Arts_> Maybe upgrade older ones with Level, like Machinist changed the first attack in the rotation when I leveled it up
[0:17:23] <RogueMinja> But I need my buttons.
[0:17:24] <%Agami23> make the other jumps faster on dragoon
[0:17:25] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt pads a got to much
[0:17:25] <%thewildzubat> cast bars on ranged dps returned lol
[0:17:25] <Sausious> I HAVE 3 SKILLS NOT ON MY HOTBAR RIGHT NOW
[0:17:26] <afronooch> PLD does
[0:17:26] <Scoobles64> Pld BAD
[0:17:28] <%kainhighwind1990> SMN needs button cuts
[0:17:29] <%Monkeyweed21> JUST ADD MORE
[0:17:29] <Fallacyxiii> GNB needs button triming too
[0:17:29] <%Serkette> I main PLD, please don't take away my buttons
[0:17:29] <+Quaraezha> Paladin, Scholar and AST are tied with the most shit added on the hotbar, excluding Pet Hotbar skills
[0:17:30] <LeonDragonheart> Pat what is your stance on the PVP style combo buttons?
[0:17:34] <17sevens> pld does, gnb doesn't
[0:17:36] <%MisterTylerrr> Paladin better end up SUPER DOPE
[0:17:37] <Nupinoop296> i have to use TWO full crossbar sets for PLD. and i do not use several of those buttons
[0:17:37] <+atteroproxy> Noooo, I jsut leveled PLD
[0:17:38] <%Nobrev> I'm learning pally right now and it's a lotta button
[0:17:39] <ZimmiZ> I have no room for pots in e8s
[0:17:39] <+Neon_Moonbeams> OMG your contacts look so natural Pat
[0:17:40] <fawkeswyznfarr> I just want female hrothgar
[0:17:40] <%MugenSandan> FAIR
[0:17:42] <+Quaraezha> While MCH has the least amount of shit on the hotbar of all jobs
[0:17:42] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> i miss Power strike for the animation
[0:17:43] <$RealThiele> flarrrrre
[0:17:43] <DianaTheAscian> sure
[0:17:44] <17sevens> gnb seriously has too many buttons for me to play
[0:17:44] <$Futurecity10> That sounds like shit
[0:17:45] <DirtyMiser> They announcing the new dps role class today?
[0:17:45] <%Kyoshikei> I just stick with GNB
[0:17:46] <goblinaccountant> Bring back cleric stance. Healings so boring in this game
[0:17:47] <%JohnAtDawn> Let me use Stardiver twice in one burst!
[0:17:48] <%StewTheGreat> StewTheGreat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[0:17:48] <%MisterTylerrr> FUCK OFF WITH DARK ARTS
[0:17:49] <%Torus1025> FUCK YEAH
[0:17:51] <+StonefireXIV> yeah sure
[0:17:51] <voltage996> i want to be able to summon a wheelchair as SAM
[0:17:52] <Tukaru> I bet PLD is going to get compressed buttons, like Attonement and Reuiniquest becoming the same button
[0:17:53] <%CitrusDrink> CitrusDrink subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[0:17:55] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt flare for drk
[0:17:56] <%Nobrev> and GOD I hated using dark arts
[0:17:58] <+ecolli37108> i just hope dancer gets a better skill than Improvisation for 90
[0:17:59] <Satanael1> they need to put 1-2-3 combos on a single button
[0:18:00] <%MisterRockett> Dark Knight needs more reasons to use their MP.
[0:18:01] <BigNerdSam> Oh fuck, I just realized: what the heck are they going to do to Samurai?
[0:18:01] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> PLD's rotation is the easiest one in the game how are people having trouble with it
[0:18:02] <+azacca_bitter> nerf MNK just "caus
[0:18:03] <%Hilleltaco> The real question is when is GNB getting its old sounds back so I don't have to mod them
[0:18:05] <%Alazull> Okay
[0:18:06] <yukin0tora> Monk tho
[0:18:07] <+PMAvers> I kinda wonder if you could do something for tanks where there's a single mitigation button instead of three, but it has charges (more via traits?) and you could use it multiple times to stack it if you need it higher.
[0:18:08] <%dankgerald> Zetaflare!
[0:18:08] <%valriot> Or put it on a 30s CD
[0:18:08] <+Brightstreak> any plans for guilty gear beta, chief?
[0:18:09] <%lucky_icarus> I wish GNB's bullet combo was single slot like in pvp
[0:18:10] <IntenseNerdRage> @patstaresat  Why do you list yourself as Special Event and not on ff14
[0:18:11] <%Alazull> I could see that
[0:18:17] <Nupinoop296> i would like for Confeitor just be one button
[0:18:17] <+thefishofwar> Bring back dark arts but it spends all mp and that's it
[0:18:18] <ashuckel> then ppl would cry you never get to use it like tornado kick
[0:18:18] <%FluffNir> I'd take that for drk
[0:18:18] <%kainhighwind1990> Do you think they'll ever just get rid of positionals?
[0:18:19] <%Monkeyweed21> but old tornado kick sucks
[0:18:19] <cizal11> Bring scourge back to drk. Or give them anything to do in their standard rotation besides 123
[0:18:20] <%TheYellowcouch> I really really just want monk to be playable lol I love that job and it don't deserve this
[0:18:23] <BigNerdSam> Nerf Bard, just because fuck 'em
[0:18:23] <Fallacyxiii> as a DRG main give me a way to go into life in the opener plz
[0:18:24] <Forester_Skippy> do the pvp thing yeah
[0:18:26] <Ubu2933> I just got all my jobs to 80! can't wait to do it again
[0:18:27] <%DEETRz> god yes
[0:18:29] <17sevens> @ItsYaGirlMaria ... no it's not. War and DRK are way easier.
[0:18:36] <Zahrtreiv> yeah they do that for pvp so idk why it cant
[0:18:38] <Tukaru> Just PvP it?
[0:18:38] <%walternatorz> Estinien combo button is fancy
[0:18:41] <%Kyoshikei> that would be nice

[0:18:55] <%valriot> Yeah the PVP combo thing they MIGHT do
[0:18:55] <$RealThiele> thats like GNB and the 6 buttons for basic rotation
[0:18:56] <cizal11> Give drk a split instead, the one button shit would be the end of this game
[0:18:56] <TurranosOrn> PVP's way of doing the hotbar is way better imo
[0:18:57] <%BoxNavy> you think of everything pat vineTommy
[0:18:57] <PinoProxie> mind blown

[0:20:34] <%Kyoshikei> how long is the whale available?
[0:20:37] <+fetrigon> PUPPETEER MASTER RACE
[0:20:37] <Sausious> that's what i've wanted from Spell Fencer/Mystic Knight
[0:20:38] <+ecolli37108> thats what i want
[0:20:38] <Zahrtreiv> oh i like that idea alot actually
[0:20:39] <%Hilleltaco> PLD but bigger number then
[0:20:39] <ZimmiZ> so paladin? LUL
[0:20:41] <ceremight> I can't see Zenos being a corsair though.
[0:20:41] <firstdarkknight> Pat, regarding the NieR Replicant vid that was just uploaded, are you sure it's the correct one? It seems like theres stuff that was skipped over since the end of the last video like a missing vid between.
[0:20:43] <Scoobles64> ooh
[0:20:44] <DianaTheAscian> yeah
[0:20:44] <%Valdorick> Blat blat with their glat
[0:20:46] <MisterTylerrr> So Paladin?
[0:20:46] <atteroproxy> Unlike the ShB reveal. I'm actually a part of the community.
[0:20:47] <%lucky_icarus> So PLD basically?
[0:20:48] <%BoxNavy> @Kyoshikei should be forever
[0:20:48] <%valriot> Its not gonna be Corsair, in the same way we will never get Time Mage
[0:20:48] <%asgard147> If it's Corsair, I hope we get to wear cool pirate hats
[0:20:49] <%Monkeyweed21> that could also describe Mystic Knight @PatStaresAt
[0:20:49] <KahnWick> I wanna be a pirate, Edge lords already have DRK
[0:20:51] <metalsiren31> My FC wants to move to Ishgard but I lowkey think that city is fugly because it's all grey
[0:20:51] <%WhereIsWill> oooh cool. but will it have the gambling buffs tho
[0:20:56] <TioXyco> but pirates are no more, so... can't be that
[0:20:56] <+JobbedBone> Corsair with multi-hit?
[0:20:56] <+thefishofwar> reverse red mage, blue mage
[0:20:57] <irlScoundrel> templar lets goooo
[0:20:59] <$RealThiele> get outta here blue dps
[0:21:00] <+Helljump3r6> would prefer mystic knight
[0:21:02] <Tukaru> So, one reason I can see not doing Sword and pistol weapons is loot table bloating
[0:21:03] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:21:06] <2DSuperiority> a melee with a decent ranged kit sounds hard to balance
[0:21:08] <%walternatorz> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:21:11] <SirBrawler18> I love ffxiv. although It will take me a very long time to catch up. Think I'm at at around 3.4 or 3.3 story content
[0:21:11] <%watts121> Did Pat buy the whale?
[0:21:13] <%valriot> Its gonna be Mhach Void melee DPS
[0:21:13] <heartlesshealer> paladin with no self healing to say that you don't trust your white mage
[0:21:16] <%Kyoshikei> @boxnavy Thanks! was scared if limited time only
[0:21:16] <%Aeogard> oops LUL
[0:21:17] <+skylerpilot> I want Beast Master tank
[0:21:20] <JojoPiero> Mystic Knight sounds Thavnairian too
[0:21:20] <%BoxNavy> i want to spellsword so bad
[0:21:21] <+ecolli37108> i want spell fencer
[0:21:21] <Scoobles64> BLITZBALLER
[0:21:21] <TurranosOrn> RUNE FENCER
[0:21:23] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt what would be the worst class they could add?
[0:21:23] <SkellyOfficial> I just want edgy
[0:21:24] <JesterByte> I so badly wish DRK had their DOT still. I would love a dot to put on enemies but it would probably have to be an aoe dot
[0:21:25] <Ginganinja4545> I want a mage melee class thing so fuckin bad
[0:21:26] <%THATGUY_789> THATGUY_789 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 48 months! Happy Fan Fest Day Pat. Big Excite
[0:21:27] <Sausious> it
[0:21:27] <+Helljump3r6> maiming arrmor also makes sense on mystic knight
[0:21:28] <%Birdigalore> REMAKE MYSTIC QUEST
[0:21:29] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Hey Pat, you, Nyanners, and Shenpai got me into FF14. I bought the guy just a week or two ago
[0:21:30] <LeonDragonheart> But would you be mad if it was a Scythe boi?
[0:21:32] <Tukaru> Also Fordola is basically Celes
[0:21:32] <viewtifulr> Want my Bltizball brother
[0:21:33] <%AzureGale> I only want a mystic knight if they came from the land of Tir Na Nog
[0:21:33] <+TheEvilOmega> how about berserker?
[0:21:34] <IntenseNerdRage> The melee class should just be another samurai to piss more people off
[0:21:35] <ashuckel> a melee character that deals magic damage
[0:21:35] <%watts121> I don't care so long as it uses Dragoon gear.
[0:21:35] <+Fenmore_> @Tukaru The weapons would just be a single weapon slot
[0:21:37] <%Valdorick> Spell Fencer is just redmage
[0:21:37] <TurranosOrn> YEAH BUT I WANT IT THO
[0:21:37] <%asgard147> That's just red Mage
[0:21:37] <%thetunnelhomer> As long as it's not Reaper from Overwatch.
[0:21:38] <twoto858> We're also getting the full trailer today, right?
[0:21:39] <%Hilleltaco> Yeah same
[0:21:40] <%DEETRz> i still believe in necromancer
[0:21:41] <+PMAvers> I'm waiting for the salt if it ends up being "whatever the hell Ran'jit was".
[0:21:41] <%valriot> Mhach Scythe wielder
[0:21:42] <Sausious> Spell Fenmcer IS Mystic Knight
[0:21:42] <%Ritei> no but do it though
[0:21:43] <%kainhighwind1990> What about that puppet class from 11?
[0:21:43] <zetanidura> if it's corsair, are they going to try squeeze in another gundam reference into the job like sage with funnels?
[0:21:44] <JesterByte> Gimme blitzball
[0:21:44] <%watts121> Cuz Dragoons have it too damn easy.
[0:21:50] <%TIME_PUNCHER> yay FFXII-2 stream
[0:21:51] <Zahrtreiv> its maiming so any job that would use heavy armor is possible
[0:21:52] <%Valdorick> What if its SWORD GOD!?
[0:21:52] <+democrazyyy> gimme a big gun-hammer like nero
[0:21:52] <+emperri> Rune Fencer in FFXI used a GREATSWORD
[0:21:54] <+scynza> give us Hammer man.
[0:21:55] <%Kyoshikei> would love Blitzball
[0:21:55] <ZimmiZ> I cant wait for Zenos to pick up a blitzball LUL
[0:21:55] <nanabi_ashiro> mystic knight, rune fencer, spell fencer are all the same jobs with different names tho
[0:21:56] <%Aeogard> DUELIST PogChamp
[0:21:57] <%ssjklyco> Watch it be a made up class called MOG
[0:21:59] <Dunmarkh> yeah but what if tho
[0:21:59] <%azacca_bitter> what if it's chemist?
[0:22:00] <+Angrec> @PatStaresAt I noticed that the transformation in ahm arang (when she is all glowy before the cocoon) and the queen beast look super similar (tongue out and everything) think there is some connection there?
[0:22:04] <heartlesshealer> rune fencer - magic knight - red mage?????
[0:22:05] <%MugenSandan> MR. LIBIDO CLASS who even cares how it would work
[0:22:07] <mashiyyat> Wheres my Wakka class Kappa
[0:22:07] <+zacyzacy> hunting horn
[0:22:07] <+ecolli37108> i dont think we are getting it today at all. but i want the idea of a melee that imbues their blade.

[0:22:08] <%dankgerald> SWORD CHUKS
[0:22:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> I find myself thinking Magitek Knight would match the pseudo sci-fi theme. But I might be an idiot.

[0:22:15] <%jackythefrost> Runefencer in XI used a greatsword
[0:22:17] <%valriot> So why would they add a Gun and Short sword Job when those exist
[0:22:18] <$RealThiele> hope mecha is good for heals
[0:22:23] <+NeonLight> Calling Rune Knight with Celes themed class armor
[0:22:27] <michaelpolandwatcher> my mana is stored in the balls...
[0:22:31] <%FluffNir> I would say Geomancer at some point since they were in the whm questline
[0:22:35] <%BoxNavy> sad :(

[0:22:38] <%Mendin> Mystic Knight of TIR NA NOG

[0:23:01] <%sniffy77> sniffy77 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Hey Pat, adding on to a recent podcast question. Halo did add in their version of gun game called Escalation Slayer. However it can be played 4v4, meaning your teammates can steal your fucking kill 15 times and keep you at tier 1/20. Also yay 9 months.
[0:23:01] <+kreepykulture> @TheRivalRose hello
[0:23:01] <%BoxNavy> @JobbedBone dude..... i want this so bad....

[0:23:11] <rosemon5001> man these FF14 fan stuff have me allways hmhm NODDERS while i dont even play it myself
[0:23:11] <moosemonkey397> astros ARE geomnacers.
[0:23:11] <%Monkeyweed21> Gunner got rolled into MCH and Time Mage got rolled into AST
[0:23:13] <%BoxNavy> :(
[0:23:15] <Sausious> they literally say that Geo is just easter Ast
[0:23:15] <ashuckel> I'd very much enjoy a magic sword user like Tactics Samurai, using the blade's magic, and not the classic spells
[0:23:16] <+emperri> it's gonna be Corsair. Gun for skills and melee with cutlass
[0:23:17] <+projectmanatees> Astro
[0:23:18] <orbulon> they just used like a blacksmith hammer too
[0:23:19] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Beast Tamer would be neat
[0:23:19] <Scoobles64> sad
[0:23:20] <heartlesshealer> >:
[0:23:21] <%walternatorz> they have an alchemist main hand
[0:23:21] <+NeonLight> That entire quest was even about how geomancers are basically astrologians for dort
[0:23:22] <DirtyMiser> What if they give us whatever class Livia or Grynewaht is?
[0:23:22] <+pandamancer224> they can always retcon that though pat
[0:23:24] <+TheEvilOmega> Oh, wait. I know. Yeti job.
[0:23:30] <Tukaru> They are just Eastern White Mages using Astrologian lore
[0:23:32] <%Atomik456> also they were explicitly just ast pointed downwards i think?
[0:23:33] <%kainhighwind1990> You think we'll ever get Relm's painter class from 6?
[0:23:34] <%Ritei> i want green mage, melee hammer attacking with healing/support buffs
[0:23:37] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt what even is a geomancer???
[0:23:39] <Tennochief> r
[0:23:44] <%BoxNavy> yes

[0:23:49] <metalsiren31> pvpSK
[0:23:50] <%Aeogard> i did 6 praetoriums :)
[0:23:51] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> I just want Bard turned into a Limited job and it turned into Ranger
[0:23:52] <+fetrigon> yes
[0:23:53] <%Macguffn> I wish they'd let us use the chocobo companion system with beast tribe companions as an option
[0:23:54] <$Futurecity10> @DianaTheAscian Earth mage
[0:23:56] <%FluffNir> less cool earth bender
[0:24:05] <Riorii> Could a Judge use a scythe?
[0:24:05] <%Arrotal> samurai quest line has a paladin use a katana
[0:24:07] <Dunmarkh> @DianaTheAscian they throw rocks
[0:24:08] <%livi242> livi242 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! FFXIV HYPE
[0:24:10] <Ubu2933> does FF have any jobs associated with crossbow? just trying to wrack my brain
[0:24:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> That'd basically be a berserker.
[0:24:13] <Stereotreme> combat botanist
[0:24:13] <+Fenmore_> @ItsYaGirlMaria That is something you know is never going to happen
[0:24:14] <%valriot> What???
[0:24:14] <+Wragong2050> Wragong2050 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:24:14] <+emperri> oh god scythes are so fucking stupid
[0:24:16] <zetanidura> magic scythes
[0:24:16] <DianaTheAscian> ehhhhhhh
[0:24:17] <$RealThiele> would mean they share dragoon gear sets mebbe
[0:24:17] <Sausious> like a REAL ONE
[0:24:17] <+Maswrath> Im gonna guess Judge still
[0:24:21] <heartlesshealer> Like an actual War Scythe?
[0:24:21] <+TheEvilOmega> Oh! How about just making TG Cid's class a job?
[0:24:23] <%MelBrooksKA> MelBrooksKA is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 7 in the channel! 
[0:24:24] <%MelBrooksKA> MelBrooksKA gifted a Tier 1 sub to deadguydied! 
[0:24:25] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Like a War Scythe
[0:24:26] <Ianrazz> Why do u think they are sharing sets in maiming 😏 ?
[0:24:28] <+democrazyyy> but thats not magical
[0:24:28] <+fetrigon> gtfo
[0:24:28] <%ConLin_Arts_> Botanist
[0:24:30] <+SolidusRex> Too close to Dragoon = another job that can use maiming gear fucking finally
[0:24:30] <%walternatorz> they'll throw every scythe at the class,
[0:24:31] <Drarrk> that's a gardening tool
[0:24:31] <BoSteed> I would figure they were teasing Zenos's new class because he is going to be the new class.
[0:24:31] <TimesApex> War Skythe
[0:24:31] <+Helljump3r6> like a warscythe?
[0:24:31] <+Fenmore_> Burial Blade DPS PogChamp
[0:24:32] <+Medrex> dude japan dont care about realism in weapon
[0:24:33] <%Mendin> Weren't there Geomancer-y enemies in that dungeon from the Four Lords quest? The one with the wukong fight?
[0:24:33] <%rkbinder> Un-syncd
[0:24:34] <+seiyaofabyss> True True True
[0:24:35] <+zacyzacy> farmer combat class
[0:24:35] <+Sargonyx> Think of the Bloodborne cosplay for Corsair doodThirst
[0:24:35] <%Alazull> Those are for cutting wheat
[0:24:35] <%AzureGale> The hard curve ones are cooler though
[0:24:36] <+mashinchaserr> what about a war scythe
[0:24:36] <+Qexec> One of the things Plague is right about : Scythes are lame.
[0:24:36] <ashuckel> thos are to decapitate things
[0:24:36] <%Valdorick> But we already have a Scythe class: Botnist
[0:24:36] <DrJamesWoods> Does the stream kinda skip around for anyone else?
[0:24:37] <+thefishofwar> why would they hide Zenos weapon if it's Corsair btw
[0:24:37] <%zyberion626> scythes are terrible weapons, great for fieldwork tho
[0:24:38] <%AllenDeadman> Scythes are notoriously impractical weapons
[0:24:38] <mai_cu> BUT COOL THOUGH
[0:24:39] <goblinaccountant> They use aether around hte blade to cut the shape doesn't matter
[0:24:39] <%JoshManVGH> But it IS Anime
[0:24:41] <%watts121> Not too much like Dragoon...but they need to wear Dragoon gear
[0:24:41] <goblinaccountant> it's all magic
[0:24:41] <ValkahRoctsteel> Judge would be really cool
[0:24:42] <%marsantas> So like a pike?
[0:24:43] <TurranosOrn> like Zasalamelsdhfoh from Soul Calibur?
[0:24:46] <%Hobojo153> Isn't a right angle 90 degrees
[0:24:47] <+BigBusinessKaiju> no u
[0:24:47] <Neoripo> They are very impractical
[0:24:47] <%valriot> It'll be Mhach like Ferdinad
[0:24:48] <+lucidrush> Cant wait for the maka albarn cosplays with new scythe job
[0:24:49] <CactusChef3> he likes right angles but not 90 degree angles
[0:24:50] <+TheEvilOmega> I just want to be Thundergod Cid.
[0:24:52] <%Ritei> scythe wielding harvester dol class
[0:24:54] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Yeah that's stupid in this game with magic and flying whales
[0:24:56] <susukouhai> Scythe user but Farmer class
[0:25:01] <+Zxtole> Yea scythes are so unbelievable in my game where you can summon bahamut
[0:25:02] <+krispen_wa> screw scythe, give me SCISSORS
[0:25:08] <%BoxNavy> will any job ever share gear with nin
[0:25:09] <MoonKing> scythes are shit weapons for weebs that want to die to an axe
[0:25:12] <+REDtheBEAST> Its gonna be beastmaster  melee dps, scythe and pet/beast.
[0:25:23] <2DSuperiority> Botanist no longer wants to cut trees, now we want to cut people
[0:25:24] <%DEETRz> less recoloured tank stuff hopefully
[0:25:25] <%Macguffn> Why does everyone believe that just because Zenos is using a new weapon it will be the new class weapon?
[0:25:26] <+emperri> scythes are nonsense RWBY garbage
[0:25:26] <+Medrex> same for archer/dancer
[0:25:27] <%kainhighwind1990> Is Hamon or whatever in the Monk questline a legit Jojo reference or is it just a coincidence?
[0:25:32] <bestwaifuritsu> Need more samurai robes
[0:25:34] <+Maswrath> The hint is the grim reaper, the most famous judge and executionor
[0:25:35] <%valriot> Monk gear barely changed tbh
[0:25:35] <T_Sasquatch> To save time bruh LUL
[0:25:38] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt did u watch the Castlevanina season or did u drop it at season 3?
[0:25:39] <Pengers> They’re making gathering classes combat ones, the only explanation
[0:25:42] <T_Sasquatch> And resources
[0:25:44] <%spacekataz18> Zenos breaks out his john deere
[0:25:45] <+Fenmore_> @emperri I like scythes cause of bloodborne....
[0:25:45] <%lucky_icarus> HELL YEAH!
[0:25:49] <%CitrusDrink> Those 490 Bozjan coats are amazing
[0:25:52] <+jerkhov_> they wouldn't do another rwby scythe after gunbreaker just happened
[0:25:58] <+twin_Egoist> Boz-YA
[0:25:59] <%Hilleltaco> (as soon as you get it to 80)
[0:25:59] <Zahrtreiv> not immediately you gotta go to 70-80 first
[0:26:00] <Klefth> Sup shitlords
[0:26:02] <42nfl19> Did they already confirm if the new DPS was a range or melee? @PatStaresAt
[0:26:03] <%SharkMissile> My prediction: Alphinaud does something stupid
[0:26:05] <%watts121> Skell class that requires Fuel to play.
[0:26:05] <Speed1ines> Everyone says Zenos is going to be the new class, but he is clearly going to get a lame "boss" weapon. It's going to be Alphy's hospital friend.
[0:26:06] <vacem64> glamour is cosmetics yes?
[0:26:07] <ZedSlayer> bozjan shit slaps
[0:26:10] <+Stormzcales_Lair> wait its confirmed maiming?
[0:26:11] <+krispen_wa> god i wish the bozjan slaying gear didnt look like shit
[0:26:11] <+Basilias_Maximus> Could also use the Scouting Set
[0:26:11] <PerfectAsymmetry> Will they ever make armor glamourable to all classes?
[0:26:11] <%valriot> valriot subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! Calling Mhach based Void melee, Corsair is big wrong
[0:26:14] <%arcaderabbit48> Do we know what info specifically will be revealed today?
[0:26:15] <Ianrazz> Zenos is 100% gonna be the new melee job, I just can't see him being a pirate
[0:26:17] <+snugglepuggs> The coat is lvl 80
[0:26:18] <BigNerdSam> The new job class just has entire dragons for arms.
[0:26:22] <%MisterRockett> Oh god that could totally be worn by a pirate too.
[0:26:23] <%snugglepuggs> New class is 70
[0:26:25] <%watts121> so heavier armor melee class
[0:26:31] <boredpantz> I'm thinking It's a Templar
[0:26:32] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> full trailer hype
[0:26:33] <%MugenSandan> You mean you didn't grind 25 hours to gather enough mats for one transmog hahahahahahaha what is happening with Destiny

[0:26:41] <VioletRosefall> do you think its possible for a glamour revamp or at least more space?
[0:26:42] <+Maswrath> but i do want it to be a reverse red mage
[0:26:43] <$RealThiele> void ark to da moon come onnnnn

[0:26:48] <DianaTheAscian> AND THE WHOLE SONG
[0:26:50] <+TheEvilOmega> I'm still working towards finishing up post Shadowbringers content.
[0:26:51] <Tukaru> Job actions too yeah?
[0:26:52] <%watts121> Beast Master is what I really want.
[0:26:52] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> i think their twitter said "dont wanna miss the beginning of the stream"
[0:26:53] <%Ritei> 8 years lol
[0:26:53] <%walternatorz> Yoshi P isn't predictable!...

[0:26:56] <%lucky_icarus> Well, my favstreamer read my message. My day couldnt get better.
[0:26:57] <theanora1> seems weird to be corsair if it's using maiming
[0:26:59] <%zyberion626> More of that banger of a theme
[0:27:00] <%Raz_Pataz> thanks for your shadowbringers for new players, got me into the game

[0:27:03] <%Kyoshikei> I really wanna hear the full song for Endwalker

[0:27:12] <+jerkhov_> they wouldn't do a gun job twice in a row
[0:27:12] <+NeonLight> Second Trial fight, after Anima?

[0:27:14] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Just now at the Getting Even with the Garlemald quest.

[0:52:17] <OdysseyKnight> Well that is where the god of the dead is mainly followed
[0:52:19] <clumsydemiurge> Makes sense, the potato capitalists are already reapers
[0:52:20] <+lucaflowe> Incoming tank shortage round 2

[0:52:20] <%BoxNavy> uldah moon2W

[0:52:29] <%KuroStardust> Eh, it's where the Thaumaturge guild it
[0:52:30] <2DSuperiority> Black Mages and Reaper there makes sense
[0:52:30] <%DorianCreed> Black Mage's Guild, as well
[0:52:31] <$Pompadourius> Dark magic goes down in Ul'dah though right? Like you summon a voidsent in the THM questline in Ul'dah
[0:52:33] <%marsantas> Ul'dah is the center of evil
[0:52:35] <fran031> @zenith0111 bro stop bitching holy shit

[0:53:07] <Kango234> @HotSauceFiend Yoshi-P
[0:53:12] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[0:53:13] <%watts121> The animations do look sick.

[0:53:19] <%Ritei> wow, amazing reaper af helmet that the job trainer cant wear lol
[0:53:19] <+mikesapartment> I don't like how sexual this feels
[0:53:22] <%Blackleafx> hugggg
[0:53:23] <nevan_44> SourPls
[0:53:25] <+LowBatteryLife> Yoshi P almost looks like a living human
[0:53:26] <+JobbedBone> OUT OF A CORPSE
[0:53:27] <%Valdorick> Then again, isn't this like, the 3rd new class to start in Uldah?
[0:53:27] <dinnydanny777> That's a hot victory stance
[0:53:28] <DianaTheAscian> prob
[0:53:29] <+chiazam> Is it the same video?
[0:53:31] <%Bigbossman91> the new battle theme is great
[0:53:32] <$QueequegTheater> So it's basically Necromancer then
[0:53:34] <Satanael1> awww huggies
[0:53:34] <dinnydanny777> Did they fix the audio LUL
[0:53:36] <+SoySocks> @mikesapartment it's just like newer jojo with the stand poses
[0:53:36] <%TheYellowcouch> might be orignial animation ngl
[0:53:36] <ShinMaxRebo> Exdeath is fucking screaming at us rn
[0:53:38] <$Pompadourius> THE SLASHES LOOK SO GOOD UGH
[0:53:39] <2DSuperiority> Lalas holding scythes taller than them will be funny
[0:53:40] <bestwaifuritsu> We also get some destroyed Garlemald in the background
[0:53:40] <Klefth> Fancy ass animations, though
[0:53:40] <%chiluzza> this music though
[0:53:40] <Kravus> This enemy design though
[0:53:41] <+SolidusRex> I LIKE how sexual this feels
[0:53:43] <Kango234> BATTLE THEME
[0:53:45] <+krispen_wa> Is this gonna be the boss theme?
[0:53:46] <yourliteraldog> That was a jojo reference
[0:53:46] <%KineticZen> So instead of Bahamut and Phoenix I get to summon Ferdiad and Doabolos
[0:53:47] <dinnydanny777> They took the break to fix the audio LUL
[0:53:48] <Klefth> Better than most job's animations
[0:53:49] <%watts121> @karl_rex it'll be like Gunbreaker/Dancer, you go through the storyline faster.
[0:53:49] <%OswaldTheDog> oh that’s hot
[0:53:50] <%Blackleafx> The zone theyre in is Garlemald
[0:53:50] <+jerkhov_> voidsent aren't dead, it's not necromancy
[0:53:51] <Nupinoop296> i love scythe characters so this is gonna fucking rule for me
[0:53:52] <+projectmanatees> Battle theme sounds good
[0:53:54] <CastellanVon> I guess oGCD stand attacks
[0:53:55] <%BoxNavy> was that a cast?
[0:53:56] <+JKnapers> new expansion battle theme is gooooood
[0:53:57] <theanora1> So is Sage class gonna be helmed by a Bunny?
[0:54:02] <lotharaxe> Wait, she transformed.
[0:54:04] <PerfectAsymmetry> The reaper summon looks like a re-skinned Ifrit Egi LUL
[0:54:04] <olaksi> yes good job pat
[0:54:04] <+UltraViolet371> that's just the most absurdly edgy thing
[0:54:04] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt YOU FUSE WITH THE STAND
[0:54:04] <nevan_44> i love its effects
[0:54:05] <yourliteraldog> The stand is even sexual
[0:54:05] <%Torus1025> totally
[0:54:06] <peyodogo> nothing sexier than a fuckin stAND
[0:54:07] <jamsbybetty> if I can make a Zasalamel glamour then fine
[0:54:07] <Oxybe> we need exdeath dragon pet ghost
[0:54:08] <zenith0111> So it is Summoner?
[0:54:08] <LoreKeeper_Thal> Death Install is so good
[0:54:10] <$Pompadourius> Stand attacks on oGCD? Makes sense
[0:54:11] <dinnydanny777> limesO spinny
[0:54:11] <+chronopaladin> so scholar-esque powerup
[0:54:11] <LilacsandFreedom> might be like Eye/Blood of the Dragon?
[0:54:13] <+CarpeDeezKnuts> what's the chance we hear about Endwalkers Alliance raids today?
[0:54:13] <+krispen_wa> JOJO POSE
[0:54:13] <OdysseyKnight> and finish with a Jojo pose
[0:54:14] <%BoxNavy> i think it has a cast
[0:54:15] <%AllenDeadman> you get possessed by the voidsent
[0:54:15] <+NeonLight> oGCDs are done by something other than the player, thats neat
[0:54:16] <%valriot> Life of the Dragon
[0:54:17] <clumsydemiurge> Okay but will there be a Magus glove-tugging emote?
[0:54:17] <LoreKeeper_Thal> it's an Install
[0:54:19] <%Kiso52> Inner release 3.0?

[1:38:14] <IntenseNerdRage> @PatStaresAt I gotta ask what was the biggest reason for removing Belts?
[1:38:15] <+jerkhov_> wolves den
[1:38:17] <Neoripo> There is 1v1 on the Wolves den
[1:38:18] <dinnydanny777> Low gravity and all that
[1:38:21] <+xBolts4Lifex> Battle Royale
[1:38:22] <zenith0111> PVP just sucks ass in F14 so who cares
[1:38:23] <$RealThiele> yea its wow arena
[1:38:25] <+jerkhov_> he means a mode not just a duel
[1:38:28] <Reireizei> 1 v 1 might not work since pvp isnt really balanced for 1 v 1
[1:38:30] <+b1unkey> b1unkey subscribed with Prime. 
[1:38:33] <penitentpendant> Blitzboll 3v3, lets go
[1:38:37] <An_Armed_Bear> Belt don't show up on your character so they're a waste
[1:38:37] <lunaraci> They dont want to balance that so wont happen xD
[1:38:37] <scientiafidem> If that mean healers can no longer 1v3 every other class then I am done for the new mode being 1v1.
[1:38:39] <%Breaknoon> Bloodborne announcement?!
[1:38:41] <An_Armed_Bear> Fashion-wise
[1:38:43] <2DSuperiority> 1 v 1 BLU only
[1:38:46] <Aeonknight_87> what @Reireizei said
[1:38:48] <%BoxNavy> fuck off fuck belts
[1:38:49] <+venusiandoom> no, no. get rid of the belts. take them
[1:38:50] <+jerkhov_> there's no unique stats in pvp so 1v1 has no point
[1:38:52] <Reireizei> I main healer in feast, and i'll tell you 1 v 1 healer vs healer woudl take forever
[1:38:54] <umbraawitch> throwing them away

[1:49:50] <%kyh9> @OdysseyKnight thank you
[1:49:51] <%Nobrev> this is actually giving me kinda Type 0 vibes
[1:49:52] <+jerkhov_> bold of you to assume we're still fighting fandaniel by the end
[1:49:53] <+glumz> rip garleans
[1:49:53] <+MaddogRasta> what the fuck
[1:49:53] <+NeonLight> Um, wat?
[1:49:56] <+coolthulhuu> oooooh
[1:49:58] <+emperri> ???
[1:50:00] <%kyh9> SCARLAMOUCH
[1:50:00] <+tjking43> i feel we might be going to garlamald earlyer than we think
[1:50:00] <+venusiandoom> zenos is either a trial boss after this or the final boss of that dungeon
[1:50:02] <BoSteed> What...?
[1:50:05] <+SteamyLinguini64> What the hell is going on in Garlemald this is Aliens level corruption
[1:50:05] <+CookieCutter007> are those fart clouds
[1:50:06] <Ciglossonjr> AMAROUT
[1:50:06] <nevan_44> WOAH
[1:50:08] <mai_cu> ouhhhhhhhhhhhhhh theres different biomes there
[1:50:10] <BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt YOU CAN SEE THE BURN
[1:50:12] <OkamiDude15> this is the new housing areas Kappa
[1:50:15] <Ginganinja4545> I dont know what this is but i want more
[1:50:16] <+Tophatlass> that looks Ancient-y
[1:50:17] <+jerkhov_> fandaniel and zenos are gonna be jobbers
[1:50:19] <umbraawitch> @CookieCutter007 yeah sorry
[1:50:20] <%kyh9> SHOW ME THE BOSSES
[1:50:27] <$Pompadourius> I think it'll be Zenos as a dungeon boss using Reaper, and then doing magic bullshit for a trial fight.
[1:50:30] <+zepherbreak> Amarout: hard??
[1:50:31] <$RealThiele> Lahabreas left the holodeck on
[1:50:32] <$QueequegTheater> I want Captain Price to walk into frame and kill Fandaniel in the first quest and then leave with no explanation
[1:50:32] <majindusto> SCARMILONE
[1:50:33] <+thefishofwar> RAD
[1:50:35] <BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt THAT dungeon looked like it was near the Burn
[1:50:40] <An_Armed_Bear> I hope Zenos is a jobber in the end
[1:50:44] <Ianrazz> Show me Anima, pleaaaaaaase
[1:50:44] <Yakobro> @jerkhov_ fandaniel probably, probably not zenos as much
[1:50:53] <+krispen_wa> I hope we make Zenos cry
[1:50:57] <%Monkeyweed21> imagine if play as Zenos to get a taste of Reaper
[1:50:57] <BeezusHrist> Guys, Lahabrea has BEEN dead
[1:51:02] <Neoripo> Where the 4 fiends at?
[1:51:06] <+venusiandoom> @Pompadourius best guess. zenos as reaper for dungeon. zenos as fucked up resonant abomination for trial
[1:51:07] <An_Armed_Bear> I want to deny Zenos his rematch so bad
[1:51:09] <+jerkhov_> zenos is at least not gonna be in his current form, he'll do some god hand shit @Yakobro
[1:51:14] <Kahpoe_Lelou> @nobrev I would love to hear time of finis in pandae.
[1:51:14] <+Katashi25> Bloodbourne 2 confirmed in FF14?
[1:51:22] <zenith0111> Trusts NotLikeThis
[1:51:24] <FuzzTime> @PatStaresAt What if the 4 Fiends are the Trial series?
[1:51:25] <BeezusHrist> Lahabrea has been dead since like 2015 LUL
[1:51:26] <+SteamyLinguini64> Zenos will probably get double crossed into being Zodiark's host

[2:06:14] <+venusiandoom> box is probably just gonna be all the shit minus the expac
[2:06:15] <%Dakuu75> ppl still use disks?
[2:06:18] <seaechiowai> man
[2:06:18] <Louie_Salmon> I mean yeah of course there's no disc for an MMO
[2:06:20] <+CookieCutter007> RIP
[2:06:21] <+emperri> Collector's Box: Limited Edition: Collector's Edition
[2:06:25] <+NeonLight> LUL
[2:06:25] <%MisterRockett> There used to be a disk????
[2:06:26] <%ZizerX> LUL
[2:06:27] <%Tarage> B O X
[2:06:27] <+skyheys> BOOOO
[2:06:29] <+jerkhov_> it makes sense though, wtf would you do with the disc when the servers are gone
[2:06:29] <olaksi> so you just buy merch
[2:06:31] <$RealThiele> we get all the profit
[2:06:31] <+Applebrappy> man that shit always sucks
[2:06:32] <17sevens> i don't have a disk drive in my pc so
[2:06:33] <OdysseyKnight> That works to solve the Steam/PC problem
[2:06:33] <%BoxNavy> its a big fuckin box who has the space
[2:06:33] <+J_PewPew> only selling empty box
[2:06:35] <Neoripo> Buy the box
[2:06:35] <General_Terro> $90 box LUL
[2:06:35] <%KuroStardust> Im very surprised it was on discs up till now
[2:06:36] <Ginganinja4545> I havent had a disk drive for years
[2:06:37] <+chiazam> THERE WERE DISKS THE WHOLE TIME!?!?!?!?!?!
[2:06:37] <majindusto> BOOOOOO
[2:06:39] <Louie_Salmon> When was there ever an MMO disc? That's a completely absurd concept
[2:06:42] <%i_chevalier> @boxnavy So no dark soul enemies. shame
[2:06:43] <Zahrtreiv> lol what are we boomers ppl dont buy disks
[2:06:47] <%BoxNavy> sell the other shit seperately
[2:06:49] <+DiscouragedOblong> than why is there a normal and a digital collectors edition
[2:06:50] <$RealThiele> "alot" $$$
[2:06:51] <+skyheys> I want a collector's disc tho
[2:06:53] <KeiPrime> I bought the box for Stormblood, it Was CHEAPER than the code
[2:06:53] <%Dakuu75> DUH
[2:06:56] <Louie_Salmon> 15% USED A DISC???
[2:06:57] <Riorii> 15% is still alot tho
[2:06:59] <+jerkhov_> ps4 players bought disc
[2:07:00] <Oxybe> WoW used to have boxes
[2:07:01] <Wolfstriker121> DUH!
[2:07:02] <+Medrex> yeah discs for MMO dont make much sense
[2:07:02] <PerfectAsymmetry> Discs are a relic of the past
[2:07:02] <+jerkhov_> some of them
[2:07:04] <+venusiandoom> I never saw one for SHB, but stormblood definitely had disks
[2:07:04] <%Nekros4442> yeah forget the discs for a MMO. The game is gone with the servers anyway
[2:07:07] <+SteamyLinguini64> Why did they do it for so long?
[2:07:07] <OneThousandTomatoes> some computers dont even have disc drives today anyways
[2:07:12] <+emperri> 15% probably bought a physical collectors edition
[2:07:12] <ShepardUA> pro move one "how to avoid leak"
[2:07:14] <mistformll> Less money spent on physical cds.
[2:07:17] <%BoxNavy> the disc users can go to hell
[2:07:19] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> @PerfectAsymmetry no they aren't
[2:07:19] <%JumboCrunchies> @DiscouragedOblong Digital only has in game items, no pin or art book or statue.
[2:07:20] <clumsydemiurge> But what if I don't have internet connection and wnat to play endwalker??? 🤔
[2:07:39] <%Dakuu75> @OneThousandTomatoes I know right. I haven't had a disk drive since like 2015
[2:07:44] <OneThousandTomatoes> LUL
[2:07:44] <seaechiowai> psaHoldon

[2:08:23] <+Talimity> they do this every time
[2:08:24] <majindusto> Oof
[2:08:24] <OdysseyKnight> Collector's box is probably just if you get it on Steam
[2:08:24] <%Rumbutt> Less of a mess than Xbox names

[2:09:41] <$Ziegsy> it says xbox up there

[2:10:07] <seaechiowai> @nobrev not one mmo is worth playing on stream over the game's own launcher
[2:10:07] <Kango234> Why do they feel the need to explain this?
[2:10:08] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[2:10:08] <+Rofiarf> it did not say xbox, just box
[2:10:08] <+whiskywolfe> Couldn't they get a model with better ... teeth

[2:10:17] <+democrazyyy> It does say xbox!
[2:10:18] <robintact> @PatStaresAt Yoshi P had more trouble writing this explanation than producing Endwalker
[2:10:19] <+skyheys> yes you can???
[2:10:21] <%Nobrev> @The_Mcmuffin it's more because sales and deals on the square enix store don't apply to the steam version
[2:10:22] <+jerkhov_> live letter is tomorrow so that would potentiall have chagnes
[2:10:27] <Tukaru> You can tell Yoshi-P is a little upset over this mess in his tone I think
[2:10:28] <+SteamyLinguini64> Nah probably reveal new job stuff right before launch
[2:10:31] <17sevens> fanbox is a different thing
[2:10:31] <$Pompadourius> Man, fuck the Steam version
