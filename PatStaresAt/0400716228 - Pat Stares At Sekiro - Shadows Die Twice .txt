[0:07:54] <deviljhojho94> ninjas are scary
[0:08:00] <Dao_Puppy> @leole11 The real pro tip right there.

Hey, Pat, did you see me tag you on Twitter for the mini-boss that wrecked you in the first run? I feel so mini-huge. Also did you see the nexus mod that changed the book V holds in DMCV into a MLP book? We both cannot escape our former brony fandom, bud.
[0:14:54] <Shishi1205> The corrupted monk OG?
[0:14:54] <Nina96> @fragdar he beat owl
[0:15:14] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat Ending conditions are 100% no-death run

[0:16:54] <%payterodactyl> Man i gotta jet @AngriestPat, I want to watch but its getting in to mad spoilers and im litterally playing the game as i listen. Have a good stream guys!
[0:16:55] <+netrac> spam rest
[0:17:07] <Shishi1205> Seems strange to fight her
[0:17:13] <RichAnvils> do you get really fat in the evil ending?
[0:17:15] <Staplecrab> old isshin is kind of a badass fight though

[0:17:22] <Nina96> i feel like u did
[0:17:24] <pectusumbra> so you went back in after midnight and beat owl?
[0:17:25] <+PrimordialDonut> Depending on what part of the story you are in and how far you got to getting the secret ending you cant get the secret ending anymore
[0:17:26] <DartonLance> isshin took me like 4hours :(
[0:17:27] <T_sarr> so would I tbh

[0:19:03] <%StEmlosWater> @AngriestPat Would you go for centipede immortality?
[0:19:05] <%nicoleymcquack> I love that you have dialogue when talking to npcs, it nakes this game feel less lonely than other from soft games
[0:19:07] <%Sackroad> Sackroad subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hey Pat. My brother had his first kid yesterday, a boy named Carter. But he's real sick in the ICU. Could use some good vibes, if you don't mind.
[0:19:08] <%ElenaManetta> the voice dubbing is not that bad
[0:19:10] <mrkerb> I thought it sounded like charles
[0:19:12] <%ElenaManetta> i don't know if people have been saying it's bad or not
[0:19:13] <Shishi1205> tomoe is the lighting thingy master right?
[0:19:24] <%alexandrecau> 2B is not evil, she just prohibited her emotion
[0:19:24] <deviljhojho94> The dub is unironically good, it's just that the japanese is great too
[0:19:27] <Staplecrab> Tomoe is totally not DLC boss TM
[0:19:32] <%Mythicalbrit> how'd u get this dialogue?
[0:19:36] <%king_wragles> Tomoe is the lightning thing ya
[0:19:40] <zanzibarian_hamster> Hey where''d you get the big sword Pat?
[0:19:46] <deviljhojho94> LIGHTNING!
[0:19:49] <Shishi1205> Cool
[0:19:56] <Staplecrab> RIGHTNINGUU
[0:19:57] <%Ravenian96> Why is lightning heretical tho?
[0:19:59] <%Aydarkzero> thought he learned it from Gwyn Kappa
[0:20:04] <%LocoCrazy_> But can he ride the lightning?
[0:20:07] <deviljhojho94> Lightning is heretical because it kills dragons

[0:20:08] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 20m 10s.
[0:20:08] <deviljhojho94> LORE
[0:20:08] <%lewdskeletor13> The game is so somber that hearing the Japanese dub is boring to me because it’s a language I don’t speak. If the voice acting was more dynamic like Yakuza I’d like it more
[0:20:11] <deviljhojho94> crikLore
[0:20:13] <Staplecrab> Lightning is the magic of the Divine Dragon, not for mortal use
[0:20:14] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> It's a god-slaying blade
[0:20:15] <%Edgy_Macaroon> she should teach you that lightning shit

[0:20:20] <%connos_livereview> WOW PLAYERS ?
[0:20:23] <%Ravenian96> @deviljhojho94 makes sense
[0:20:24] <%SashaStarshine> A blade that can kill Pat huh?
[0:20:27] <%SaltyDongs> Enemy crab attacks
[0:20:29] <%Aydarkzero> Lightning killing dragons in a From Software game? no Kappa
[0:20:29] <%BonewheelVanguard> and in strange eons, even death may die
[0:20:31] <%Agami23> pat got mystic eyes of death perception??
[0:20:31] <%magicaki> have you stabbed Hanbei with it yet?
[0:20:34] <Shishi1205> Can we name it Bugkiller @AngriestPat ?
[0:20:34] <deviljhojho94> delicious
[0:20:36] <+PrimordialDonut> Good, you arent too late
[0:20:39] <blackbookalpha> is this for old lady again?
[0:20:40] <%lewdskeletor13> Can that blade kill Elmo or is he too strong? @angriestpat
[0:20:42] <$cureneckbeard> abipopSNACK
[0:20:42] <silverira> did he defeat Owl?
[0:20:48] <Nina96> yes
[0:20:49] <T_sarr> why is this game centered around getting food?
[0:20:49] <%lewdskeletor13> Yes
[0:20:52] <+King_floppy> how about Daddy?
[0:20:55] <Shishi1205> I mean it basically is used to kill bugs
[0:20:55] <FG_Noob> Dat jelly doughnut
[0:21:01] <blackbookalpha> Cronchy Rice for Old Lady
[0:21:04] <Nina96> is he?
[0:21:52] <%Mythicalbrit> can u not save the kid if u havent had this dialogue?
[0:22:00] <Shishi1205> But it was whitered?
[0:22:02] <%lewdskeletor13> All these Fromsoft games seem to revolve around ending immortality
[0:22:13] <%lewdskeletor13> Or ending anything really
[0:22:17] <Staplecrab> Man if only we had a way to get to the past
[0:22:23] <deviljhojho94> "Immortality is for bitches lmao" Miyazaki

[0:25:35] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Starting out strong, getting you ass blown out by a centipede. :)
[0:25:39] <deviljhojho94> Kung fu more like dung fu
[0:25:42] <+OldWorldFool> Centipedes are irl demon spawn anyway
[0:25:44] <%SaltyDongs> Clawverines
[0:25:52] <Shishi1205> That thing is strong
[0:25:57] <%Gogogolem> My favorite part about that kung-fu tree is the passive increase to item drop rates makes farming materiels easy.
[0:26:00] <Ner234> Are you tho?
[0:26:01] <%ScreamingMeat> apatBig Poise damage!
[0:26:14] <+PrimordialDonut> What was the last thing you did in the last stream?

[0:27:18] <%Aydarkzero> 12hr stream means podcast delayed Kappa
[0:27:25] <Nina96> @AngriestPat what r u looking for?
[0:27:26] <Jeemukun> hey @AngriestPat getting paid next week an wanting to get either DMC5 or Sekiro, haven't really played a DMC much or a souls game so I'm not sure which to get
[0:27:31] <+JackMillerTime> the first ninja weapons were farming implements because the samurai wouldnt allow weapons
[0:27:36] <Shishi1205> Speaking about badasses
[0:27:37] <%ArcanumMBD> @Gogogolem The dragon mask is rad but I havent used it because i have other stuff to dump my juice into first
[0:27:39] <+Punchasaur> okay THIS time
[0:27:41] <SunsetJack> Oh woah, you can cast it twice.
[0:27:42] <%lewdskeletor13> Is Rope Guy just Spider Man?
[0:27:49] <%Gogogolem> @ArcanumMBD Sssh
[0:27:55] <%Gogogolem> @ArcanumMBD no spoilers
[0:27:55] <Ner234> A double? That's new. Did Pat do some off screen grinding?
[0:27:56] <%nicoleymcquack> I planned to play Persona this evening but if this is a long boi stream like last night then i guess I'll be sticking around here
[0:28:00] <Shishi1205> I remember a clang battle for several seconds vs owl
[0:28:03] <deviljhojho94> nice
[0:28:07] <$cureneckbeard> Of course he did off-screen grinding, he's Pat
[0:28:08] <Shishi1205> AI borked for a bit there
[0:28:10] <%NWR_James> and now we wait for crazy talk
[0:28:16] <%ScreamingMeat> Where is Lady Butterfly's Kunai again?
[0:28:23] <%lewdskeletor13> Pat you’re pretty good at the game now!

[0:29:22] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Nah he's not a centipede thing. Even the centipede monks aged. The Rejuvinating Waters is a different type of immortality
[0:29:25] <whycans> did you actually check
[0:29:25] <SunsetJack> Even if you give him the white pinwheel?
[0:29:28] <blackbookalpha> I think Pat is the first person to discover that fanning the chubby guys defeats them. Fextra Life hasn't discovered it yet
[0:29:31] <%madhattergay> its so weird seeing you jump down from hieghts that would kill you instantly in any other fromsoft game
[0:29:32] <whycans> wrong rice

[0:29:57] <Shishi1205> He's pretty picky
[0:29:57] <%psychodave1234> you need 3 types
[0:29:58] <T_sarr> the other one tho
[0:30:00] <whycans> you haven't done every step yet
[0:30:02] <%Niney_Who> You need a third
[0:30:02] <blackbookalpha> Its not Rice Crispies™

[0:31:04] <SunsetJack> That looks like it.
[0:31:05] <Staplecrab> Are you trying to do Purify or Return right now? Seems like you're doing both lol, I think they're exclusive with each other
[0:31:05] <%connos_livereview> egg fried rice is best rice
[0:31:08] <whycans> you are talking like a quest has failed and yet you don't even know that the ending quests require
[0:31:13] <blackbookalpha> give previous bait to a very very 'special fish'
[0:31:14] <+Okicop> I had to sleep at 10ish so I missed a lot I think last night
[0:31:25] <blackbookalpha> you'll know the fish when you see it

[1:02:48] <acesahn> I'm tired of Japan taking credit for the West's dragon!
[1:02:53] <+Zereaux> what what ifd the dragon is the player character from the ending of bloodbourne where you became a great old one?

[1:03:07] <%Reizie_Etherealm> She's got the fake dragon heritage, not the centipede from the rejuvenating waters.

[1:03:25] <JackalKing> She straight up JUST said Japan
[1:03:26] <Shortnamer> i mean technically everything is to the west of everything
[1:03:29] <%Kangumosa> Japanistan

[1:03:40] <QuaiRolDor> so the divine dragon is fuckin dudley the dragon @AngriestPat
[1:03:40] <%StEmlosWater> MANY characters have said Japan
[1:03:42] <%lewdskeletor13> They said Japan like two minutes ago
[1:03:42] <%Remery_> Just stick your dick in bug guts
[1:03:42] <%RabbiKing> Or the everlasting dragons of dark souls
[1:03:45] <honmaheadbutt> So the immortal dragons from Dark Souls are the same dragons here?
[1:03:49] <+hax_metatron> Japan is where all the cool shit happens FeelsBadMan
[1:03:50] <whycans> you found it
[1:03:51] <Jeemukun> I mean, the intro tells you it's the Sengoku period
[1:03:51] <Ner234> @Unlimited_ I retract my statement LUL
[1:03:51] <%cvp5127> japan you say LUL
[1:03:51] <%Typhaeon> More like Red Dead China
[1:03:53] <%Gogogolem> it says japan in the intro too
[1:03:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> this game is set in Sengoku era Japan.
[1:03:54] <+Punchasaur> @t_sasquatch get fucked lol

[1:03:57] <T_Sasquatch> @AngriestPat @Jpdodds Well my ass just got blown out
[1:03:58] <acesahn> Japan is just an expression.
[1:04:00] <Shishi1205> West for Japanese People means Eurasia
[1:04:01] <%SydSavage> Are dragons in DS just big rocks?
[1:04:02] <%SashaStarshine> BUHNING
[1:04:03] <Shishi1205> Not america
[1:04:03] <Darren716> Yo what if this game isnt in the Bloodborne universe but is instead in the Metal Wolf universe
[1:04:03] <Jeemukun> the ashina and hirata are all made up tho
[1:04:03] <+Qsmash_> sick burn
[1:04:04] <OrochiSheewa> is america even discovered at this point in time?

[1:04:06] <%Kangumosa> holy shit that lifesteal
[1:04:06] <kiryuva> when the battle music kicks up after silence it's so funny
[1:04:07] <+roach__> people forget how close japanese lore is to lovecraft horror
[1:04:09] <kiryuva> "DUUUN"
[1:04:10] <TakesGuts> china would be cool, you can have medieval eu shit too in there
[1:04:11] <%MagickBurritoh> OH

[1:04:34] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Ashina is a real place, mount Kongo is a real place, however the two places are very far apart in real life
[1:04:34] <%Kangumosa> Richard!!!!!!!!!!
[1:04:36] <battlefield900> he dead dead
[1:04:38] <pectusumbra> funny enough, human bodies don't burn all that well, mostly made of water
[1:04:39] <%jiin6> Japan is in the heart of all centipedes
[1:04:40] <Shishi1205> Snake juice time?
[1:04:41] <blackbookalpha> snek viscera has
[1:04:43] <reonome> no its sanzang
[1:04:47] <%orangerainbow> @angriestpat now rest so that she shows up in her original spot
[1:04:49] <+Zereaux> so kohryu is from blooudbourne
[1:04:52] <freedomboyz> the west meaning....?
[1:04:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> it's just magical super Japan. and you see an incredibly small piece of Japan.
[1:05:01] <blackbookalpha> snek viscera = persimmon
[1:05:03] <+Vestillion> Human bodies are also full of calories, which do burn well.
[1:05:04] <mrkerb> Has Pat fought a dragon or is it just tears at term for something
[1:05:10] <+Vestillion> hard to light, easy to burn
[1:05:15] <BunnyEmperor> And that's the end of my story
[1:05:18] <Ner234> Stab the local wildlife Pat
[1:05:19] <Jeemukun> fought a giant snake at least
[1:05:21] <Prevot> japan is to the west of japan if you go west enough 🤔
[1:05:22] <blackbookalpha> don't let them sell you car insurance
[1:05:22] <LixFury> so do you actually need tp do all this or do you just need the hearts?
[1:05:27] <Shishi1205> So enemies can fall off now but only if they jump right? @AngriestPat
[1:05:30] <complicatedclarity> pat dislikes the zucc

[1:16:02] <%psychodave1234> paige is the best kind of backseat gamer, she gives amazing advice
[1:16:02] <%JJCheeker> enbMask
[1:16:02] <+SpectrumSpy> That was a hot interception
[1:16:02] <Ner234> @Zereaux Lady
[1:16:02] <%CerberusDriver> having a laugh
[1:16:02] <thirstyskaven> use the centipede kiss attack
[1:16:03] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Seems like a hannya to me
[1:16:05] <Shishi1205> Ca you blame him
[1:16:08] <LixFury> @AngriestPat those things al;ways spawn infront of you their easy parrys
[1:16:09] <+sixcubit> why are shinobis in this game so goddamn large
[1:16:10] <Jeemukun> it's definitely a nun, they just call her a monk for some reason
[1:16:15] <+SpectrumSpy> Freakin' spiked like a volleyball
[1:16:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think it's a centipede
[1:16:18] <Shortnamer> kissing centipedes is a pretty weird fetish tbh
[1:16:21] <$cureneckbeard> a monkipede
[1:16:27] <Shishi1205> Priestess in the lore
[1:16:28] <%SashaStarshine> hA hA hA
[1:16:33] <deviljhojho94> perfectly executed
[1:16:34] <T_Sasquatch> YEYEYEYE
[1:16:34] <%dave323dave> sekiro is not choosy with who he kisses
[1:16:36] <@PeachSaliva> It’s be easier to tell if I could see the kimono
[1:16:41] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Translation error maybe?
[1:16:42] <%JJCheeker> Letting centipedes crawl up your butt
[1:16:42] <AllenDeadman> that's what she said
[1:16:44] <%Ravenian96> S H A D O W
[1:16:44] <complicatedclarity> zoneRage punch her in the nuts
[1:16:44] <%jiin6> Nun is a form of monk

[1:16:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> sekiro is a big ho
[1:16:51] <+Promessa_EX> sekiro x kuro
[1:16:54] <%psychodave1234> dont peek behind the kimono
[1:16:57] <+sixcubit> can a snap seed deal with this phase or no?
[1:16:58] <T_Sasquatch> @AngriestPat in the second phase you can immediately grapple up then she will spawn the middle and you can stealth her
[1:16:59] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Why is everything in this game so proficient at fighting? Everyone can do flips and shit, the monkey uses swords and guns
[1:17:00] <official_nakmatic> hhmmmMMMMMMMMMmmmmm

[1:17:34] <%Reizie_Etherealm> POSTURE
[1:17:44] <whycans> one can skip this phase completly
[1:17:48] <%psychodave1234> use your face to block her attacks
[1:17:54] <%psychodave1234> its the best defense
[1:17:57] <%JayEarly> @Cthulos excuse me
[1:18:00] <%Remery_> Do a sexy dance for her
[1:18:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> it's like playing Dragoon in FFXIV

[1:18:41] <@PeachSaliva> I’m fairly certain this is a female based on the way she holds her kimono sleeve (historically speaking in kabuki and shit) but could be wrong
[1:18:44] <%Tucker0603> @Monkeyweed21 i see you are a discple of Wimp Lo

[2:44:40] <%Kangumosa> 300 too much

[3:12:12] <turf_wind_and_fire> !Uptime

[3:12:30] <SidBoyTM> Keepo
[3:12:30] <Shishi1205> not if they are invisible
[3:12:32] <ManlyMcBeefington> anyone know if pat knows where a hidden headless in via a diving tunnel?
[3:12:33] <%lovebass4stuff> nope
[3:12:37] <blackbookalpha> Pat felt 4 feet taller just now
[3:12:37] <%willjar313> Pat used Ultra Instinct.
[3:12:41] <%crimsonharvest> good job frustrated its me Harv
[3:12:42] <%mostundesired> Pat truly is Invisiblessed.
[3:12:48] <%king_wragles> That would make sense, given that the texture/model change is dependent on animation and IF the animation can be halted with a hit
[3:12:48] <$megamonmon123> invisiblessed
[3:12:50] <%FrustratedAF> hi harv
[3:12:55] <+TheBitingIrish> Did Pat kill the training NPC?
[3:12:55] <turf_wind_and_fire> I just meant the game. I thought he was at the end yesterday and figured he had beaten it yesterday. My bad @AngriestPat

[3:13:12] <%Lithdoran> Didn't Pat also beat the Cleric Beast in the Bloodborne demo while it was invisible?
[3:13:13] <%Kangumosa> @AngriestPat Probably interrupted his invis and they didn't script an exit out of that function.
[3:13:16] <+Okicop> was it not supposed to be invisible?
[3:13:20] <+DeaconBluesClues> like woolie loves grappling hooks but Pat is the one that would actually benefit from shinobi rope tricks more
[3:13:27] <+WaywardSera> SUTANDO POWA
[3:13:30] <pshuuu> 1 more u probably forgot about cause he was behind a random pool
[3:13:31] <PlatinumWyvern> @lithdoran he always said he did. now I believe him
[3:13:33] <%Tucker0603> I think that's it
[3:13:36] <ManlyMcBeefington> @AngriestPat if you want a location I know one via the looks of the entance of the hidden tunnel

[3:58:31] <%Kangumosa> @TheShal Za Wurado
[3:58:33] <Shishi1205> After this, proceed to the Dragonspring idol in Hirata Estate and find the pot vendor in the *** may have to purchase a couple of things before he’ll unlock his talk option. Once you do so, speak with him until you exhaust all of his dialogue. He will give you his own special bait that will kill this large carp. Snag the item and head back to your new Feeding Grounds idol.
[3:58:37] <+Zereaux> nonsense you just havent drank enough red bull yet

[3:59:26] <LegendaryDorkKnight> throw a toaster in the water
[3:59:30] <Shishi1205> Too Long; Didn’t Read: Great Sakura. Jump in lake. Speak to NPC on half-sunken house on left-side. Swim underneath. Find cave and swim through. Get Palace Grounds idol. Walk into house. Kill monsters. Turn towards chest and open that door. Step out of door and turn to the right. Grapple up onto the roof. Follow the grapples to the Feeding Grounds idol. Speak with NPC about the carp. Maybe optional: Feed fish precious bait (can get from pond in Guardian Ape Hole).

[4:28:50] <reonome> they're just ayyyyliens pretending to be gods
[4:28:52] <%sabertoothzombie> isn't that what it means to be divine?
[4:28:52] <Nina96> unless divine means sucking ass
[4:28:54] <Monkeyweed21> thats what being divine looks like
[4:28:56] <%Lithdoran> God has always sucked ass :3c

[4:29:05] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Isn't that like FromsSoft's schtick? The Divines are either assholes or it's a shitshow up there
[4:29:06] <%nmaten> this is just the fountainhead its not really divine i dont think
[4:29:07] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Divinity is relative in all honesty
[4:29:07] <+BigBruthaThunda> no divinity no problem
[4:29:08] <devanmuse> I mean... it's common for humans to mistake dumb alien bullshit for divinity
[4:29:09] <%PaladinDupre> FISH DAD
[4:29:12] <%nmaten> its just on a mountain
[4:29:17] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I mean, doesn't every religion kinda suck ass if you take it too far?
[4:29:17] <+SpectrumSpy> Gotta say, not a lot these things look particularly "divine
[4:29:18] <LegendaryDorkKnight> immortal toilet sounds pretty bad
[4:29:19] <$nademonkey1100> pat when has the divine ever been good in a fromsoft game
[4:29:23] <abakkus> I mean if immortality is throat centipedes, maybe divinity ain't that pretty either
[4:29:23] <Dementedpenguin> To be fair, when was the last time "divine" beings in storytelling were awesome? Kappa
[4:29:25] <OkamiDude15> why live forever if im just gonna look like some dank ass fish person?

[4:29:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> Where is my favorite daughter I just got her immortality
[4:29:39] <%DirtyGaijin> i mean how enjoyable can it be really?
[4:29:39] <+VashyronM> @AngriestPat that depends on your definition of divine. If you assume that divine means "good" then yeah...they aren't. but if divine is a another or "higher" state of being, it's possible.
[4:29:44] <+Evitron1> maybe i like smelling like fish every day
[4:29:47] <+Evitron1> ya never know

[4:45:24] <%lovebass4stuff> for me

[4:45:28] <+YoungKuja> Pat are you enjoying so far, like super hype or is this more just a nice ride of a game so far.
[4:45:28] <waifoong98> LUL
[4:45:29] <jubejube56> it is easy
[4:45:29] <zebult> it looked tubo-easy

[4:45:29] <whycans> this fight is a mercy
[4:45:31] <DracaenaLeaf> Why did you back the save if it was easy
[4:45:31] <%crimsonharvest> dragons being weak to lightning has been a thing since any JRPG had elements to consider at all.
[4:45:32] <pshuuu> its a gimmick fight like dragon god and bed of chaos. its just cooler
[4:45:32] <Monkeyweed21> it's a setpiece
[4:45:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> 1.04 patch save us

[4:45:39] <OkamiDude15> looked like a set piece
[4:45:39] <abakkus> more like a weird ceremony than a fight
[4:45:41] <Bouldus> to be fair none of the bosses are over the top
[4:45:42] <Nyckelus> The fight’s a gimmick fight.
[4:45:42] <Staplecrab> big gimmick fight
[4:45:44] <+SpectrumSpy> Wasn't much of a fight per se
[4:45:45] <waifoong98> it is the Dragon God
[4:45:46] <%El_Desperad0> It looked like the 2nd easiest dragon boss in a Fromsoft game

[5:05:00] <TakesGuts> @angriestpat keep going there's more shit in the outskirts
[5:05:08] <majindusto> Pat using Joseph Joestar's secret technique: RUN AWAY!!!
[5:05:11] <Hellarussian> BIG coward
[5:05:11] <AFlyingTaco1> @mcjimbo12 It is tough, but beatable. Try picking off his ads by luring them away from him and killing them, or using the shuriken. Then, you can lure him out into the open for a stealth deathblow.
[5:05:12] <+Punchasaur> @mcjimbo12 i think you're spoiled on johns
[5:05:12] <turf_wind_and_fire> Is he swinging a chain on top of a waterfall at all???
[5:05:13] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Good call
[5:05:20] <%collindoucet99> Fuck him up
[5:05:25] <turf_wind_and_fire> Swinging the chain . . . swinging the chain . . .
[5:05:26] <+attackofthesage> @mcjimbo12 DMC is about being stylish. This game is about being smart and knowing when to attack. If you're not the patient type you could just return it
[5:05:30] <%DirtyGaijin> the fat evil
[5:05:34] <JackalKing> Man, Sekiro looks freaking great, but it makes me really worried we will never get another Tenchu. I want a proper stealth ninja game. I wan my boy Rikimaru back
[5:05:36] <PrinceOfEden> OOF
[5:05:36] <AFlyingTaco1> @mcjimbo12 From there, just call in an assist from the NPC and that should trivialize the fight a bit more.
[5:05:36] <Spyderninja> cheese it by stealthing all the other guys/running away to reset their states, stealth hit juzou for one bar, get nogami to help/be a distraction/die for you
[5:05:37] <deviljhojho94> Holy shit
[5:05:42] <HaikuRaichu> ABSOULUTE UNIT

[5:06:41] <+trashamn> God i love this game

[5:07:13] <%PaladinDupre> HOWS it FEEEEL SHIGEKICHI
[5:07:13] <zebult> @AngriestPat can't you just leave the area until he de-aggros and then stealth kill him again?
[5:07:15] <InugamiTheHound> he's got a curved sword! a curved sword!
[5:07:17] <+mcjimbo12> AFlyingTaco1 i'm not used to this style of combat at all. luring adds off the boss and just 1v1ing then... stealth killing the boss? is extremely bizarre gameplay and feels kind of cheesey
[5:07:20] <Saltmeisterr> mortis
[5:07:30] <Saltmeisterr> deathe count?
[5:07:36] <%MagickBurritoh> watch out for his burning blade

[5:08:08] <AFlyingTaco1> @mcjimbo12 Yeah the ads are a huge pain in the ass, and the stealth attacks on bosses is certainly weird. But I'm pretty sure the major bosses can't be cheesed out as hard.

[5:10:28] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @Solomon742 this man knows his shit and has good taste
[5:10:30] <%dukenux> DMC V is a healthier choice LUL
[5:10:32] <%Toynota10> If you've been playing DMC for a while, DMC5. We've all been waiting for that game forever
[5:10:32] <AFlyingTaco1> @collindoucet99 DMCV is much more friendly towards everyone. This game is fun but hard as fuck and relies heavily on you parrying'/dodging attacks correctly.
[5:10:33] <SummonerMagno> Anthem
[5:10:33] <%mostundesired> Didn't you kill like half of them.
[5:10:34] <HaikuRaichu> In the middle of a warzone, lovely

[5:10:46] <%DirtyGaijin> both very different games, DMC5 may be more accessible

[5:11:25] <AFlyingTaco1> I'll get Anthem a year from now when it's on sale for like 15 bucks
[5:11:29] <PrinceOfEden> I mean, you can still get DMC5 for like $40 off of Fanatical right now. @collindoucet99
[5:11:31] <majindusto> Anthem = DON'T BUY IY IT
[5:11:35] <LegendaryDorkKnight> @toynota10 cause of the casuals
[5:11:38] <+wizard_of_diamonds> People that bought Anthem deserve it LUL
[5:11:39] <%DirtyGaijin> people like looter games
[5:11:42] <PrinceOfEden> So I say DMC5 right now while it's on sale. @collindoucet99
[5:11:42] <zhunter94> @zhunter94 is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[5:11:45] <%Toynota10> Guess the casuals don't care if a game's bad as long as it's popular
[5:11:50] <majindusto> "DON'T BUY IT"
[5:11:55] <%DedlokPM> @AFlyingTaco1 that's like $15 too much to pay for anthem
[5:11:56] <%Toynota10> WHICH SUCJS

[5:12:40] <majindusto> Anthem is not woth it
[5:12:40] <AFlyingTaco1> If not, then I'm not gonna bother with it.
[5:12:40] <PrinceOfEden> One second, they also had a promotion code going on
[5:12:44] <SnaKemuho> yeah they're idiots

[5:12:59] <%aishman> By the way, have we still not beaten Prologue man?

[5:13:28] <InugamiTheHound> pat must unlocks 8 gate banki now
[5:13:28] <%Toynota10> Maybe the cool customization drew in more people to Anthem

[5:13:44] <%mastertwin2> It destroyed all of my PS4 sound until I closed the game. Took that as a divine omen

[5:38:01] <+Pcson> i went to make food and come back to this, wtf happened to bring out a demon of hatred?!
[5:38:02] <manoshake> Dlame shield would be great
[5:38:03] <%ThePuddingDead> the sculptor!? thats him!?
[5:38:06] <FiftyFiveP> the whistle might actually work
[5:38:11] <+TransporterX7> I'm sorry did he say Sculptor?
[5:38:11] <+PrimordialDonut> Jump
[5:38:11] <DeebzNutz100> Thats the Cleric Beast's Cousin
[5:38:11] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> We need more Wall Scrolls on the inside
[5:38:12] <TheBlankAce> The whistle was connected to his backstory
[5:38:13] <whycans> grew his arm into fire
[5:38:14] <braincraft> Wait, what?
[5:38:17] <%DirtyGaijin> yes orange penis and all
[5:38:18] <%collindoucet99> How about a fire extinguisher Shinobi tool? @angriestpat
[5:38:19] <+PrimordialDonut> Dashes never work on that
[5:38:20] <+twohitgood> oh shit, he did say sculptor
[5:38:21] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I would HATE for tenchu to become this supernatural demonic stuff
[5:38:21] <T_Sasquatch> literally just the cleric beast
[5:38:21] <braincraft> Is that what happened to his arm?
[5:38:26] <LegendaryDorkKnight> this is why the katana is the ultimate form of weapon
[5:38:26] <+Shadicara> Pat it's just death
[5:38:27] <%Ion_Laser> Sculptor? Where???
[5:38:27] <%docpepperphd> hey just got back
[5:38:27] <devanmuse> @jacob2pop if that really is the sculptor, maybe the whistle would distract him. It did belong to his old buddy
[5:38:29] <SnaKemuho> dodge the flames, block the feet, jump the sweeps, that's it
[5:38:29] <+tygermom> you cant parry his
[5:38:30] <%docpepperphd> what the hell is that
[5:38:30] <+tygermom> him
[5:38:35] <+Punchasaur> thats manus, not paarl or cleric. noobs
[5:38:35] <%nmaten> his posture doesnt recover that fast
[5:38:36] <FiftyFiveP> scultop was missing an arm, so he grew a demon one
[5:38:36] <%ThePuddingDead> oof
[5:38:40] <%nmaten> just try to parry
[5:38:41] <Psyramics> you taking damage through the blocks
[5:38:43] <+tygermom> you gotta souls this boss
[5:38:51] <+tygermom> hit and run
[5:38:51] <jacob2pop> @devanmuse hence the suggestion lol
[5:38:51] <+TheBitingIrish> Someone told me that this started out as a Tenchu game, but they changed it to something new
[5:38:53] <%ThePuddingDead> so is this what dragon rot does then?
[5:38:54] <%wolfofsound> wail on those nuts
[5:38:55] <manoshake> Not the balls
[5:38:56] <%skizzuto> yeah stab his crotch
[5:39:00] <turf_wind_and_fire> YEYEYEYE hit him in the DICK!

[5:39:06] <+tygermom> nope
[5:39:09] <+Shadicara> So they teach you not to play like souls only to have you play like souls later on LUL
[5:39:11] <blackbookalpha> Google Otogi, is hella neat
[5:39:13] <ZComiX> Hit
[5:39:14] <devanmuse> @jacob2pop wasn't sure if you just meant "beast enemies hate whistles"
[5:39:14] <+tygermom> he don't care about that whistle
[5:39:15] <ZComiX> Him
[5:39:15] <PRchris13> he is the combination of all huge guys in the game
[5:39:16] <LegendaryDorkKnight> you really are just cutting his dick off, poor guy
[5:39:17] <PrinceOfEden> A fine attempt, BUT POINTLESS
[5:39:18] <ZComiX> In the DICK
[5:39:20] <+PrimordialDonut> Jump
[5:39:21] <bardofurbellum> *not* Bloodborne 2
[5:39:23] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat One of the shield fan upgrades you can get lets you fully block fire hits
[5:39:25] <%A_Gris> @angriestpat consider the flame shield and picking up that red gourd maybe?
[5:39:27] <FiftyFiveP> maybe he needs to upgrade it?
[5:39:29] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 265
[5:39:31] <%Ion_Laser> apatBlep apatBlep

[5:39:40] <Megiddodoge> I don't see any "good cat"
[5:39:40] <DracaenaLeaf> I love that we can sort of hear the purring when the game is quiet
[5:39:41] <FiftyFiveP> the last whistle upgrade can calm rage
[5:39:44] <+Wintermute_VRC> @AngriestPat Red gourd is sold by the fish merchant
[5:39:47] <%ThePuddingDead> i see best cat :3
[5:39:53] <+Shadicara> I think he needs to start playing like it's dark souls again
[5:39:55] <ZComiX> Is bloodborne the new AC series, where every game is in a different era??
[5:40:01] <SteelC0W> why don't you switch to the guy with the pet Crow
[5:40:08] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @TheBitingIrish I heard that too, maybe Tenchu isn't interesting enough so they went with the supernatural route
[5:40:09] <Lord_of_all_Edges> You need to farm for blood soon
[5:40:10] <Bouldus> oh he literally said sculptor
[5:40:17] <bracketmanps> wait, this is the sculptor?!

[5:42:54] <%Lithdoran> Maybe Pat should use some sugars here??

[5:45:39] <+TheyTookMyBeard> @AngriestPat when he throws the fire balls at range, you can't dash through them, you just have to back away, best thing to do is just bait them out if hes at range
[5:45:40] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat Are you trying to kill him with Dragonrot?
[5:45:42] <Saltmeisterr> OH LOL
[5:45:42] <caol2017> Teostra is a lukewarm bitch now
[5:45:42] <mason1196> dodging those fireballs was super sick
[5:45:43] <bashful_bard> This seems extreme

[5:45:49] <+Jeebus4> so you're not supposed to beat this boss right?
[5:45:50] <+Ralyks9117> lol it looks like hes throwing flaming people
[5:45:51] <Megiddodoge> @AngriestPat he uses fire

[5:46:06] <the_hexe> Three health barus? Thanks a lot FromSoft.
[5:46:07] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I'm not sure if this is sad or vexing
[5:46:11] <%Lithdoran> Orangutan is the realest
[5:46:12] <+Jeebus4> it doesnt add up
[5:46:14] <%lewdskeletor13> BABY sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[5:46:18] <FiftyFiveP> @AngriestPat maybe whistle fully upgraded would work? since it's supposed to calm rage
[5:46:19] <+VashyronM> this is why he couldn't carve anything but wrathful buddhas and all he saw was ashina on fire
[5:46:19] <+Shadicara> He got better the moment he twigged it's a blood borne fight Kappa
[5:46:22] <PrinceOfEden> The question is, does this happen only if you resurrect too much?
[5:46:25] <%Tucker0603> @reizie_etherealm both?
[5:46:25] <LixFury> he litterally said sculpter LUL
[5:46:26] <%ThePuddingDead> uh
[5:46:27] <ZComiX> is his arm a devil bringer?
[5:46:31] <r90thunder> It seems like this boss has some cheesing tactics
[5:46:32] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Funny, I also have my cat and was doing that at the exact same time LOL
[5:46:34] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Both
[5:46:34] <LixFury> that wasnt in the japanese audio
[5:46:35] <reonome> @Jeebus4 what, just git gud
[5:46:38] <+PrimordialDonut> This boss took me a few dozen tries but I got it, he has two new attacks per phase
[5:46:40] <Iberry2011> I wasn't paying attention, who got shamed and why
[5:46:41] <SnaKemuho> @princeofeden nope he's always here
[5:46:41] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> What happened to him anyways?

[5:46:48] <%Piemen99> nice
[5:46:52] <$valriot> Wait....did FROMSOFTWARE make this? PogChamp
[5:46:52] <antshadow14> nut
[5:46:53] <SteelC0W> hey chat, question. what does dying cost you in this game? I don't see currency like in the souls games and there's a try again after first death button?
[5:47:01] <%ThePuddingDead> hug ball
[5:47:03] <%waifoong98> also huh, I got gifted a sub again? Thanks @Breakfast_Megapowers
[5:47:05] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I'm sad that he has to die this way, I'm angry that he has to become something so vile
[5:47:06] <Megiddodoge> @valriot no
[5:47:08] <PrinceOfEden> @SnaKemuho Good to know, it'd be BS if they locked a boss like this behind a mechanic like that.
[5:47:10] <antshadow14> deez nut
[5:47:10] <%mostundesired> Maybe he won't see you if you hug that wall.
[5:47:10] <PrinceOfEden> Thanks.
[5:47:10] <etalmeta> @PrinceOfEden resurrection doesn't affect this, also dragon rot only progresses on true death
[5:47:13] <+VashyronM> @SteelC0W xp and money
[5:47:17] <ZComiX> you lose sen an exp i think?
[5:47:18] <+Shadicara> Dying gives all the NPC's aids
[5:47:18] <%DirtyGaijin> @SteelC0W money,exp and npcs gain dragonrot
[5:47:19] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> How many giftsubs is Pat going to give out per death? Kappa
[5:47:21] <the_hexe> Nope. Activision made this entirely. Kappa Kappa
[5:47:26] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @waifoong98 No prob
[5:47:28] <%Lithdoran> @SteelC0W EXP and money. Also if you die too much, all your NPCs get dragon cancer aids
[5:47:31] <majindusto> Laurence the First Vicar (Kinda)
[5:47:36] <gloppie> @SteelC0W NPC's start to "Rot" and you have to tuse an item to revive them. Stotps they're quest lines until you do
[5:47:37] <SteelC0W> got it thanks all
[5:47:48] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat I know what your trying to do! Your gonna give him Dragonrot cuz the Scultor is one of the characters that gets it!
[5:47:50] <$punkthepsychopenguin> showlove100 showlove100 Hey Pat, Happy Monday! Thank you for your advice yesterday, I was considering picking up ff14. Is the new dlc race worth buying if I've never played it before? Or should I wait? showlove100 showlove100
[5:47:53] <%Ion_Laser> DEATH COUNT 270
[5:47:55] <WolfCrotch> @AngriestPat reminder that the feathers are an invincible dodge state
[5:47:59] <%Ravenian96> Feels like it would be difficult to posture break him.
[5:48:00] <Monkeyweed21> gotta facefuck that crotch
[5:48:01] <Megiddodoge> Everytime someone says this is just lawerence I push my sub back another day.
[5:48:02] <%nmaten> just in case you forgot this was a fromsoft game they throw this shit at you
[5:48:02] <DeebzNutz100> お前はもう死んでいる

[5:48:28] <%kewlmyc> apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo
[5:48:29] <Splatterfest> you gotta understand that combo already he has killed you with it like 9 times @AngriestPat
[5:48:33] <gloppie> This fight would be cool in bloodborne, but I feel like it doesn't play well to this game's mechanics.
[5:48:35] <%Ion_Laser> @Breakfast_Megapowers Not yet LUL
[5:48:35] <majindusto> Weak Baby Flesh
[5:48:37] <%aishman> @AngriestPat Looks like the best strategy it just get in close, stay close, and dodge/deflect his stump attaccks
[5:48:40] <gloppie> Also very attritiony
[5:48:42] <+twohitgood> so is this the result of the dragon rot?
[5:48:49] <%Lithdoran> No
[5:48:51] <SnaKemuho> @princeofeden they only lock certain bosses behind certain ending choices, there's a choice where you get 2 bosses but skip an entire area and a bunch of other bosses including this one
[5:48:53] <asumanetakeke> Did
[5:48:54] <Coffee_JD> This is the result of too much monkey booze
[5:48:58] <r90thunder> Anybody notice he has a sword sticking out of his right shoulder?
[5:48:58] <%DirtyGaijin> result of his anger
[5:48:59] <DaniReDux> @aishman easier said than done
[5:49:01] <bashful_bard> Seems like atk buff is the only thing emblems should be used on for this guy
[5:49:02] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> wooooooow
[5:49:02] <%Tucker0603> @twohitgood no, this is shura
[5:49:05] <DeebzNutz100> D-Virus

[5:49:09] <asumanetakeke> Did he just say sculptor...?
[5:49:09] <caol2017> you're supposed to superman dive when they jump up like that
[5:49:17] <%Lithdoran> This is the result of Orangutan being a magic buddha monkey ninja
[5:49:20] <whycans> the secret boss fight in the memory hasn't even made it to youtube yet
[5:49:21] <etalmeta> @twohitgood dragon rot does not affect this
[5:49:21] <majindusto> HIT THE DICK
[5:49:24] <ZComiX> so why did the sculptor become this creature?
[5:49:25] <$punkthepsychopenguin> Is this dark souls 2.0
[5:49:29] <$punkthepsychopenguin> Are you an unkindled
[5:49:36] <UnusualSalmon> the really cool part about this boss is that, it's a dark souls boss. there's almost no parrying or prosthetic tools it's just dodge and hit just like soulsborne games
[5:49:42] <+VashyronM> asshole is his weak point. confirmed
[5:49:43] <LegendaryDorkKnight> is ThIS BlUd BoRne3
[5:49:43] <%Gogogolem> seriously though that fire shield

[5:51:16] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 51m.
[5:51:16] <+PrimordialDonut> This is like a 10 minute fight I believe

[5:51:41] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Well, that'll do it
[5:51:42] <+starkandstag> you lack the flames of hatred
[5:51:42] <DeebzNutz100> Need that umbrella
[5:51:45] <LegendaryDorkKnight> chat rn is this a blood borne?
[5:51:45] <$valriot> JIST LIKE MANUS PogChamp
[5:51:47] <FiftyFiveP> get the fire umbrella
[5:51:50] <caol2017> Pat this fight is actually pretty straight forward if you dodge everything
[5:51:51] <%A_Gris> Aight guys I think we can move past the red gourd/flame shield stuff and just let him figure out the boss before he go gears up to really finish it.
[5:51:51] <asumanetakeke> maybe use the whistle before the deathblow???
[5:51:51] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Fireproof umbrella shield?
[5:51:54] <jubejube56> ik you can jumo to the side of the big flame pillar attack then hook onto him
[5:51:55] <%XzileGaming> basically cleric beast 2.0
[5:51:55] <bashful_bard> Oh I guess mist raven would work

[5:52:17] <Megiddodoge> If you switch the language to French the game gets easier. Because your language is garbage.
[5:52:22] <InfiniteSwagbito> @AngriestPat That big fire line he shoots at you has a distinct windup, so I guess evading to the side as soon and as much as possible before he even launches it.
[5:52:23] <+TheBitingIrish> kek
[5:52:25] <+TheBigO75> he;s learning the fight
[5:52:34] <majindusto> Max got his wish for Bloodborne 2

[5:52:47] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat The Malcontent upgrade for the Shinobi Fingers stuns him 3-4 times and Divine Confetti also works.

[5:53:15] <%ArcanumMBD> It's funny because Pat has NO CLUE who the final boss is
[5:53:15] <%Gogogolem> The final boss is clearly Dracula
[5:53:17] <LegendaryDorkKnight> :)

[5:54:19] <%Ion_Laser> DEATH COUNT 275
[5:54:21] <+PrimordialDonut> I still dont understand how dashing through his charge is bad but jumping through is fine
[5:54:22] <+Wintermute_VRC> @AngriestPat Use the metal hat against the fire bombs
[5:54:23] <asumanetakeke> maybe use the umbrella
[5:54:24] <LegendaryDorkKnight> the final boss is Sephiroth king of weeb
[5:54:25] <ZComiX> The Final boss is the vriends weve made along the way
[5:54:26] <Cranky_Construct> man could you imagine if it was some kind of anicent white glint though
[5:54:27] <Rezroc> Is the last boss Metal Wolf?
[5:54:27] <asumanetakeke> the fire one?
[5:54:31] <Cranky_Construct> like some wooden NEXT
[5:54:32] <bashful_bard> Does this boss give anything cool?
[5:54:33] <%cvp5127> its obviously nobunaga
[5:54:35] <$valriot> And so, Sekiro cast himself off the highest mountain in all of Olympus
[5:54:46] <$punkthepsychopenguin> Jesus
[5:54:51] <whycans> like every boss it's power
[5:54:52] <blackbookalpha> Final Boss is an Armored Core mech

[5:55:03] <+punit216> What is this games version of the moonlight greatsword ?
[5:55:05] <%waifoong98> The final boss is obviously Yukimura since everything is on FIREEE Kappa
[5:55:05] <Megiddodoge> The final boss is rigors of being a single father in this economy.
[5:55:06] <$punkthepsychopenguin> The final boss is just the unkindled one going: I RUINED EVERYTHING
[5:55:08] <+Punchasaur> its ss5 gogeta
[5:55:12] <JoXul> Use mist raven tho
[5:55:13] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat are you doing every ending on stream or on your own?

[5:55:48] <+Ralyks9117> the ashin one

[6:01:12] <+doggettxalex> "don't get hit" the game

[6:19:57] <$valriot> @supathief I mean Capcom is on a roll right now, no reason for them to not just bring BACK Onimusha
[6:19:59] <cgmerryo> The divine dragon is a tree though, not made of rocks
[6:20:02] <%aishman> @AngriestPat I wonder if you can talk to the Owl from the past and confront him
[6:20:04] <+fizzguy47> Dark
[6:20:06] <$hatesdps> im straight waiting for a wyvern like the one nameless king was riding
[6:20:08] <%GabeSweetMan> How unfortunate for them.
[6:20:12] <majindusto> Away, Away!
[6:20:16] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Don't hurt their feelings Pat
[6:20:18] <primarch_lupercal> dont bully the memory people BibleThump
[6:20:31] <Supathief> @valriot Onimusha Dawn of Dreams is reason enough to not bring it back though. LUL
[6:20:36] <%GabeSweetMan> Is Lapis our "Slab" equivalent?
[6:20:37] <majindusto> Lazuli
[6:20:41] <ManlyMcBeefington> the should be atr the carp store
[6:20:42] <+Dragon4234> @AngriestPat Not that I've found yet
[6:20:48] <%waifoong98> doesn't the karp man sell for some more scale?
[6:20:50] <%rubbishbinge> I hope time gets so screwy that Sekiro ends up in modern day
[6:20:52] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Dawn of Dreams exists. LUL
[6:20:55] <+PenmanLupine> Lapis is the gem that lives with Peridot
[6:20:57] <+MetroidHunter26> Yeah from what I saw you only get 2 each playthrough
[6:21:03] <+Dragon4234> @waifoong98 yeah only two from what I can tell
[6:21:05] <MonocleCoyote> @AngriestPat you can buy lapis form the carp merchant
[6:21:09] <+TheBitingIrish> Retuuuuurn the slaaaaaab
[6:21:15] <MasterTonberry23> There was a level in one of the Tenchu games that took place in modern day
[6:21:23] <Malkraz> only 2
[6:21:25] <$valriot> @supathief Fair, but a soft reboot Onimusha, in RE Engine with design concepts from stuff like Nioh, and this and Souls game would be amazing
[6:21:27] <heroicspiritavenger> We don't talk about JEMS here
[6:21:30] <Khorneflakes_> We've come a looong way from these guys
[6:21:31] <majindusto> Peridot Best Gem
[6:21:31] <LegendaryDorkKnight> there was a whole game it's called onimusha 3
[6:21:37] <%GabeSweetMan> ??? Game? You alright?
[6:21:39] <+Eddy21forsaken> Lapis more like lupus....
[6:21:41] <$hatesdps> @MasterTonberry23 that syringe business ninja was the coolest
[6:21:42] <%GabeSweetMan> Hitboxes!
[6:21:45] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat expect more Lapiz in the DLX
[6:21:48] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Upgrding Weapons effin Slabs
[6:21:48] <blackbookalpha> dont summon zone
[6:21:51] <%PaladinDupre> *DLC
[6:21:53] <+BigBruthaThunda> Pats on a rampage
[6:21:57] <%aishman> Not gonna talk to the buddha?
[6:22:13] <afraidanuffin> Is this Samurai Soul?
[6:22:21] <+WorldsBestPanda> Did Pat ever dive in that water?
[6:22:23] <$Tarcanist_> underwater pat? @angriestpat
[6:22:30] <%ScreamingMeat> @Supathief DmC was WAY worse than Dawn of Dreams but they still did DMC5. Onimusha has hope.
[6:22:32] <Malkraz> he was always 1 health bar
[6:22:32] <LegendaryDorkKnight> @gabesweetman most of onimusha 3 took place in modern times with the french guy and samanosuke
[6:22:38] <whycans> the memory started you off with ninja dog for a reason
[6:22:39] <majindusto> CUTTING TREES...WITH your BODY
[6:22:40] <jacob2pop> no, it's Shinobi Spuls
[6:22:42] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat He was always 1 healthbar
[6:22:44] <%waifoong98> he was never a boss
[6:22:45] <+PrimordialDonut> You also get 2 lapis from the Demon of hatred. I did not buy lapis from the carp guy before this
[6:22:58] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Wow you can Wall jump like in Bokunodamia
[6:23:08] <MasterTonberry23> big fall damage for large mans
[6:23:11] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> better than the game too
[6:23:53] <$valriot> Plus, especially now, Onimusha style games in this Soulsborne style is crack cocaine for the gaming market. and on Capcom budget and flair, that aint no joke, thats big videogame
[6:23:56] <Finaldragoon> is this the equivalent of going back to Undead Burg and murdering everything?
[6:24:06] <MasterTonberry23> i've an urge to play for honor now
[6:24:25] <%docpepperphd> look at these jobbers
[6:24:26] <%lovebass4stuff> Are we still grinding or heading to the final boss
[6:24:30] <LegendaryDorkKnight> woah nice

[6:25:11] <%lovebass4stuff> Still
[6:25:14] <PlatinumWyvern> can't you use an item to pacify the dogs
[6:25:18] <%ScreamingMeat> @valriot Onimusha with a Nioh/Soulsborne style mixed with classic 1-3 gameplay would be awesome
[6:25:22] <TheRealShifty> why not just use shurikens??
[6:25:28] <majindusto> Yes, Run into the Fire and the Flames
[6:25:29] <MasterTonberry23> @PlatinumWyvern Yeah. The item is your sword
[6:25:29] <%Ravenian96> @AngriestPat shurikens can be good vs doggos
[6:25:41] <%waifoong98> spear bearer, uses sword??????

[6:27:39] <LegendaryDorkKnight> moobie squad
[6:27:45] <+dougrayman> this is ninja gaiden done right
[6:27:50] <%GabeSweetMan> So two axe blows break them?
[6:27:57] <LegendaryDorkKnight> ninja gaiden is ninja gaiden done right
[6:28:12] <+dougrayman> like ninja gaiden 3?
[6:28:13] <whycans> super grand slam masters
[6:28:18] <majindusto> TOUGH BOY
[6:28:20] <ShadeNightz> yes
[6:28:24] <%nmaten> ninja gaiden black is where its at
[6:28:25] <LegendaryDorkKnight> razors edge was good
[6:28:31] <artoflec> no like ninja gaiden 1 2, dragon sword and razor's edge elaSmile
[6:28:34] <%StewTheGreat> were those big guys wearing ninja headbands?
[6:28:39] <%GabeSweetMan> So essentially time has edged forward by like.... a half hour?
[6:28:39] <%waifoong98> hmmm, what's going to be here
[6:28:50] <%ScreamingMeat> @valriot If they did a Remake/Reboot of Onimusha that was basically Dark Souls or Bloodborne with the Manual Soul Absorption and the Issen counter system I'd be happy with that
[6:28:55] <theonlyxception> ng sigma was bae af
[6:29:03] <%Ravenian96> @AngriestPat that prayer bead necklace had Robert's name in it
[6:29:09] <%GabeSweetMan> I'll be honest I was not expecting a redux of this area.
[6:29:10] <%Ravenian96> I scoped it
[6:29:13] <%MagickBurritoh> eavesdrop them
[6:29:19] <majindusto> WHYYYYYYYYYYY
[6:29:19] <LegendaryDorkKnight> why cant people just say this game is it's own thing?
[6:29:23] <%waifoong98> well they killed you so of course not Kappa
[6:29:31] <+dougrayman> ninja gaiden black is good survival adventure action game. 2 is more of an action hack and slash game. I prefer the game mechanics of the first game over 2 and 3
[6:29:33] <%nmaten> i wish theyd make an hd rerelease of the xbox ninja gaiden on pc id buy that shit in a heartbeat
[6:29:33] <majindusto> ?
[6:29:49] <SirDogBear> hired goons
[6:30:10] <afraidanuffin> yer a goon
[6:30:16] <LegendaryDorkKnight> goon squad
[6:30:20] <%ScreamingMeat> @dougrayman Ninja Gaiden Balck was the shit. Team Ninja need to bring the franchise back
[6:30:20] <%GabeSweetMan> Dropping pellets like candy
[6:30:27] <$valriot> @screamingmeat I mean they dont have to go full Souls, but at least this kind of combat pacing, with the succ. Capcom just has the ability to add flair, like manual counters that trigger izuna drops n shit
[6:30:35] <TheRealShifty> Pog
[6:30:42] <WeebFever> Ninjas have invaded your memories
[6:30:43] <majindusto> DO IT COWARD
[6:30:43] <+dougrayman> Nioh is a fun game too
[6:30:48] <artoflec> Nioh has an izuna drop now its pretty crazy
[6:30:54] <%GabeSweetMan> OST plz
[6:31:07] <%ScreamingMeat> @valriot Yeyeyeye
[6:31:08] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Niohs pretty cool all about the biggest weeb there ever was
[6:31:22] <+dougrayman> the izuna drop was added on the third dlc i believe. together with the fire ninpo from ninja gaiden
[6:31:25] <$valriot> Nioh has a Jin Hayabusa fight, its fuckin SICK
[6:31:33] <ZComiX> Did pat ever go back to the Buddha girl ?

[6:33:31] <Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 Fromsoft has covered medival, future, european, japan. Anyone else want them to make a game set in the middle east? Sprawling cities and merchant towns, great canyons and mountains, sprawling deserts, underground caves, quicksand and the like? There's so much there, and plenty of folklore to draw from for enemy designs. That or south American jungles/rainforests. I hope the podcast doesn't get canceled again tomorrow. PAT.

[7:11:44] <$hatesdps> hi kurt
[7:12:15] <%joylent_blue> nice guy pat
[7:12:20] <$cureneckbeard> maybe he thought it didn't go through
[7:12:29] <Nina96> anytime it hits zero
[7:12:36] <SpaceGuntank> that still counts, mulligan or not.
[7:12:42] <%joylent_blue> the count is approaching 300 i think
[7:12:43] <Nina96> whats the death count btw?
[7:12:45] <%redstonej> anytime I die inside
[7:12:49] <%nmaten> just cause you res doesnt mean you didnt die
[7:12:52] <%waifoong98> 270 something
[7:12:59] <majindusto> Gotta count your Failures
[7:12:59] <%hntronium> It was 28)+
[7:13:05] <frozenottsel> 1002
[7:13:05] <%hntronium> 280+
[7:13:11] <%joylent_blue> just divide by 2, ez
[7:13:18] <$cureneckbeard> okay someone go back and watch the entire run and count the actual number
[7:13:41] <Nina96> Thats a good thing
[7:13:52] <%hntronium> Its rewarding
[7:13:55] <%joylent_blue> now do it on SoS SwiftRage
[7:14:06] <+tygermom> did pat beat the game?
[7:14:13] <%joylent_blue> not yet
[7:14:25] <reonome> no dragon assholes
[7:14:26] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat like the camera
[7:14:28] <+governmentmass> the stealth in sekiro is meh
[7:14:30] <tortugatime214> @angriestpat did you see the trailer for persona 5 r?
[7:14:30] <%waifoong98> Armored Core 3 Last Raven has a pretty good ending build up
[7:14:36] <+tygermom> did pat beat the demon of hatred?
[7:14:44] <%hntronium> No
[7:14:45] <Nina96> the swamp is the weakest part of ds3
[7:14:46] <%redstonej> Poison Swamp for life yo
[7:14:51] <%Eclipse_knight_> ds3 is linear asf and feels like bloodbornes leftovers
[7:14:51] <+tygermom> i got him down to hils last node, doable fight but you have to approach it like a classic souls boss
[7:15:03] <%nmaten> I wish I cared about feudal Japan at all
[7:15:04] <%joylent_blue> BB is so good but so much of its main story areas are..... meh, optional areas are great though
[7:15:06] <SpaceGuntank> some of the armored core games had good pacing and endings
[7:15:09] <%Futurecity10> shame so many people are falling off the game
[7:15:13] <reonome> thanks Activision?
[7:15:15] <blackbookalpha> Sekiro's 'Scope' looks more well-thought off
[7:15:15] <%nmaten> cause BB and ds's setting is so much more appealing to me
[7:15:24] <%waifoong98> @SpaceGuntank now fight 3 bosses in a row in a single mission Kappa
[7:15:37] <%Shillk> Shillk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! hey pat, i missed the stream but wanted to say elmo rules
[7:15:44] <%camodikk> ya he stopped trying demon cause he didnt have it in him to set aside a few hours to attempt it, he will do back, he had already been at it like 7 hours
[7:15:47] <%joylent_blue> god i can't wait for bloody palace
[7:15:50] <%Futurecity10> Also a shame that the boss music is bland
[7:16:07] <%laserbeaming> People have hacked the Bloody palace into the game
[7:16:12] <%laserbeaming> it seems the code is there
[7:16:15] <%joylent_blue> yeah i saw that
[7:16:21] <%joylent_blue> some goofy shit in there
[7:16:37] <$punkthepsychopenguin> Ohhh okay, thanks Pat!
[7:16:38] <%hntronium> There's no undoing that stream baby joke
[7:16:41] <%laserbeaming> also, I saw a screenshot with 7 dante weapon slots and I am now confused
[7:16:42] <Pseudonymity> !uptime
[7:16:43] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 7h 16m.
[7:17:01] <+tygermom> this game is great however it's extremely draining
[7:17:04] <%joylent_blue> you unlock 7 weapon slots after beating SoS
[7:17:13] <%redstonej> chicago
[7:17:18] <+tygermom> especially late game, the fights are hard as fuck and take a lot of time just learning them

[7:18:25] <%waifoong98> @joylent_blue it is not hard to juggle between them LUL but what other 3 weapons

[7:19:13] <medril07> do you get a devil bringer?
[7:19:17] <%joylent_blue> waifoong98 the idea of switching between Rebellion and Sparda seems pretty redundant so yeah idk
[7:19:18] <+tygermom> yeah I don't see this game having a lot of reputability
[7:19:23] <medril07> snatch
[7:19:28] <+tygermom> replay ability
[7:19:37] <trashcansan> I
