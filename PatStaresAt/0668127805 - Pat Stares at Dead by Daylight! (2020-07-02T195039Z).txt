[0:04:17] <%Bailey__gaming> Pro tip, check the news maybe once a day max to make sure that theres nothing that affects you for that day then avoid it, ditto for social media, try to go for 1 walk every day and always take a mask with you for if there are people around

[0:22:33] <%MaritimeSpanker> that will ruin your fans
[0:22:34] <Zebroneath> @Kaask Nice. Thank you.
[0:22:35] <%DappercatEsquire> don't put RAM in the wrong way
[0:22:41] <Reborn2killu> dont use the compressed air for tires
[0:22:42] <%cowardman93> vaccuum your vents on the PC
[0:22:45] <Nordguy> can't i just vacuum in there
[0:22:51] <%ragingbrachy> put beans in your tower to cool it off
[0:22:52] <%Daxalog> If you dont blow the dust out you may one day not get video out
[0:22:56] <gsoto83> Get a datavac, compress air will chill it and thus introduce rust
[0:22:57] <%cowardman93> do both
[0:23:07] <+tiefbard> just play trapper and spam traps 4Head
[0:23:11] <%Dementedpenguin> Learn from your losses, don't get frustrated from it.
[0:23:16] <@PlagueOfGripes> but as a survivor I can hide in bushes for a very long time
[0:23:19] <%sleepy_coffee> @scrublord009 you might need to burrito the cat in a blanket to keep em from escaping or clawing you
[0:23:20] <+konekoryugamine> @PatStaresAt So it essentially is "become serial killer in horror movie and use their mindsets"
[0:23:29] <Nordguy> microwave your RAM to make it go faster
[0:23:30] <%KingKZ> My advice is learn to love getting dunked on.
[0:23:41] <+konekoryugamine> @PlagueOfGripes Unless you wanna be Sarah Michelle Geller and be the last one standing
[0:23:43] <%Shockrates20XX> Is it even possible to hit 5 gens in 3.5 minutes?
[0:23:44] <@PlagueOfGripes> winning fast also means shitty points
[0:23:48] <@SoFarFetched> @PlagueOfGripes That's when you start making friends with the bush. Then get concerned once it starts talking.
[0:23:49] <%Kaask> Play for points, not for kills.

[0:24:13] <+Deepfriedcthulhu> While learning, if you do the things and they all get out, you will still get a TON of points
[0:24:14] <scrumbotime> So recently I bought a 2060 super card because i was tired of shit looking like garbage. Then after installing it, i found out one of my monitors was DEFINITELY hooked up to my mobos' built in trash card, and in theory for 3 years i was maybe running EVERYTHING off that card and not the 1050 ti i had in there

[0:25:18] <%Joustar_> black nails are the worst, you can't see the quick at all

[0:43:50] <%DesertPenguin> A brand can have a good thing and also have a bad thing. Wow
[0:43:53] <+JingKaisean> brands aren't products
[0:43:58] <AmericanaRed> PAT RACED US sbfpPatschwitz
[0:43:58] <nimu290> Pat's not wrong
[0:44:03] <%Chichen> Chichen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 20 month streak! Heya pat, I've tried out DBD lately and playing as Killer is pretty fun, Survivor feels boring as shit but I think it's just the standing there QTE gameplay that doesn't do it for me. Boy, the salt and toxicity you get as a killer is the BEST.
[0:44:17] <%Chichen> PridePog
[0:44:27] <%sleepy_coffee> The human guise falters as the robo Pat overheats with the processors
[0:44:29] <+SH1NK1R0> @patstaresat was wondering if you were at all aware of a game called othercide. Comes out in a few weeks and is a rougher like xcom style game
[0:44:33] <%GalacticaPhanto> Elric is the shit
[0:44:34] <Coystick> Hahahaha the Razor video, you nerd
[0:44:35] <blink289> thats fake
[0:44:39] <%Dementedpenguin> Weird flex
[0:44:39] <%DesertPenguin> Witcher is a ripoff of Elric
[0:44:42] <%GalacticaPhanto> it's just Geralt but better
[0:44:57] <garbageheaphound> That book is is basically the basis of the chaos gods from warhammer
[0:44:59] <%Chichen> he WHAT
[0:44:59] <%maenos2> did they fix pyramid head's ass?
[0:45:02] <%AlphaTauri> was his ass buffed?
[0:45:03] <%Mendin> They balanced HIS ASS AWAY
[0:45:03] <%azure22900> Pretty shitty seeing that he got nothing in compensation.
[0:45:05] <%BoneofMalkav> @DesertPenguin Exactly
[0:45:10] <%ragingbrachy> coneyHANDS üçë
[0:45:12] <@SoFarFetched> they apparently put more cloth on his ass
[0:45:19] <%PlainSimpleTailor> HE IS CALLED THE RED PYRAMID
[0:45:28] <%DesertPenguin> Future Pat
[0:45:29] <@SoFarFetched> had to cover that shit up cause it was too revealling
[0:45:31] <Coystick> It's pronounced Mel-nii-bone-nay
[0:45:33] <%weissguard> It's actually really nice tech.
[0:45:36] <%ragingbrachy> POST IT
[0:45:37] <LustrousDust> breaking news, elmo is cute
[0:45:38] <+oktavia_von> didn't they nerf his ass
[0:45:39] <%DesertPenguin> So for people that wanna skip this part can go right to the gameplay
[0:45:39] <%Fooguwu> please post these pics
[0:45:45] <%sleepy_coffee> Did DbD give pyramid head his butt back?
[0:45:46] <%Joustar_> useful tech

[0:45:51] <%DaKnightWarrior> Future Cat lytAGH psaWink

[0:46:05] <%LVDoomien> hey do you get added to the sub discord automatically or whats up
[0:46:06] <%Invlux> just like pornhub
[0:46:09] <gruulmagebeast> what if youtube people are in the present and we are in the past right now?
[0:46:13] <Discount_CJ> I will, thanks
[0:46:15] <+YabbaTroll> that sounds very helpful
[0:46:17] <%CappuccinoGuil> Wonder where I've seen that timestamp before Kappa
[0:46:18] <bubbli97> @PatStaresAt post that pic on twitter NOW
[0:46:18] <%maenos2> how's pyramid head's ass?
[0:46:20] <%DesertPenguin> I think he's serious
[0:46:21] <%maenos2> i can't tell form this angle
[0:46:24] <%apolitenoob> Timestamp comments have been singlehandedly killed
[0:46:25] <Jodoxk1> Time to skip all that gameplay for the good stuff Kappa
[0:46:27] <%lethallunacyx> wait a minute
[0:46:30] <%marvel877> Why is PH covered in mud?
[0:46:32] <gsoto83> @Invlux thats not fair, Pornhum is beyond the curve!
[0:46:33] <%DesertPenguin> It looks smaller
[0:46:38] <%CappuccinoGuil> IS IT STILL CAKED UP???
[0:46:38] <%YakumoYomi> Double-wide surprise?
[0:46:39] <$evermoore_hex> PogChamp500 eyyo Pat, what do you think of the current running theory that Springtrap from Five Nights at Freddy's might be coming to DbD eventually
[0:46:41] <$evermoore_hex> evermoore_hex's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[0:46:42] <%ragingbrachy> THATS JUST AS BAD
[0:46:43] <horse_disguised_as_horse> Review ph ass
[0:46:44] <%sleepy_coffee> You heathen not taking horizontal pics!
[0:46:44] <%AlphaTauri> that cake got nerfed
[0:46:44] <+konekoryugamine> He looks like he's covered in mud
[0:46:46] <+tangoragahn> I consider timestamps a Value Minus
[0:46:47] <%ChaosAethr> wheres triangle girl!!
[0:46:47] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah more cloth just added.
[0:46:49] <+konekoryugamine> Oh.
[0:46:50] <RCIRainer> The booty got nerfed
[0:46:51] <%Starotter70> Oh my gooooood
[0:46:53] <%BoneofMalkav> Blood-ah?
[0:46:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> Blood dries brown
[0:46:56] <%marvel877> It's BLUD!
[0:46:57] <+generalve> @PatStaresAt thoughts on next gen titles going to 70$ base price ?
[0:47:06] <MavrickHauntX1999> SeemsGood
[0:47:06] <%LVDoomien> @SoFarFetched do you get added to the sub discord automatically or is it manual?
[0:47:07] <+konekoryugamine> Is that confetti?
[0:47:12] <%DesertPenguin> Prestige gives you a blood-covered skin? That's badass
[0:47:15] <%ShawnTK_> ShawnTK_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[0:47:17] <%Taisuru> Covered in shit
[0:47:20] <%XzileGaming> "Balls exposed 2:11" "Balls exposed 3:47" ""Balls exposed 7:17" timestamps
[0:47:22] <horse_disguised_as_horse> ph ass is no longer dummy thicc
[0:47:24] <+JordantheKitty> i can't believe they nerfed ph
[0:47:27] <+fredbet96> hryK
[0:47:28] <+JordantheKitty> i'm a little salty about it
[0:47:28] <nimu290> what's that smell
[0:47:28] <+tiefbard> as a GayPride my disappointed is immesurable and my day is ruined
[0:47:28] <%Dementedpenguin> If they're gonna be like that, then remove the Spirit's crack. SwiftRage
[0:47:31] <%DesertPenguin> Bshlooit
[0:47:34] <+fredbet96> Thanks for the PrideHeartR @shawntk_
[0:47:35] <@SoFarFetched> @LVDoomien so in your discord there should be a thing to sync your discord account to twitch subs.
[0:47:35] <%Dementedpenguin> but don't >_>
[0:47:51] <gruulmagebeast> the el "gateau" Kappa
[0:47:56] <%ChaosAethr> no bbq and chili?
[0:47:59] <%BoneofMalkav> They finally got an El Gato to stack? LUL
[0:48:07] <%LVDoomien> okay I'll unlink and relink it farfetched thanks
[0:48:09] <horse_disguised_as_horse> So he's good now
[0:48:17] <%Chichen> @PatStaresAt it also teleports away from Pyramid Head if he stays by too long now
[0:48:18] <reddpop_> cakes are fixed!
[0:48:20] <%DedlokPM> DesertPenguin it gives you them piece by piece over 3 prestiges. For killers: Weapon, head, body. For survivors head, chest, legs
[0:48:21] <%lethallunacyx> Yeah that helps
[0:48:27] <%ChaosAethr> got it
[0:48:29] <+oktavia_von> PA power is stored in his ass
[0:48:32] <%MaritimeSpanker> BBQ and chili isn't good with PH
[0:48:33] <%lethallunacyx> Only
[0:48:37] <yeetdabsenpai69> soundscan't normal hooks have that happen too?
[0:48:38] <%MaritimeSpanker> it doesn't proc off the cages
[0:48:41] <gruulmagebeast> the perks are the friends we made along the way
[0:48:43] <%KingKZ> Campers miss the entire point of playing the game
[0:48:47] <RoboFussin> I'd try PH if I wasn't too bitched to play killer NotLikeThis
[0:49:02] <%apostateCourier> he could body block the cage so it was impossible to rescue from. The cage will now teleport away if he tries to do that shit.
[0:49:03] <%Treuan> More perks need to give BBQ's blood point bonus. But then I guess it would hurt Bubba?
[0:49:05] <horse_disguised_as_horse> Campers are god tier cancer
[0:49:08] <@SoFarFetched> I still don't understand people who rage quit the match. Cause they lose all their bloodpoints and just give everyone else bloodpoints for quitting.
[0:49:16] <+konekoryugamine> @PatStaresAt This is actually a legitimate question. Do you know anything about helping your pet with ulcers? My dog has been sick since the day before yesterday, and I'm running out of ideas for what to do to help him. :(
[0:49:25] <%DaKnightWarrior> man i miss Silent Hill.
[0:49:30] <%FallenAngelZelos> RIP PH's nerfed booty :(
[0:49:38] <BinaryBetrayer> Sounds like a Veterinary would be better help.
[0:49:54] <+not_draven> take it to a vet?
[0:49:59] <%superc37> @konekoryugamine take him to the vet?
[0:50:00] <+konekoryugamine> I've tried to tell my mom that but she refuses. Money issues.
[0:50:04] <RoboFussin> Imagine paying irl money for a skin with a nerfed ass
[0:50:11] <%LVDoomien> @SoFarFetched from your discord connections apparently you have to manually join sub discords now, couldve sworn it was automatic. Thanks tho
[0:50:12] <+konekoryugamine> And I'm just saying screw money, I want my Rere to be okay
[0:50:14] <+konekoryugamine> :(
[0:50:15] <horse_disguised_as_horse> His add ons are good but not his parks
[0:50:16] <+JordantheKitty> it's his default perk you silly pat
[0:50:16] <%xmetalicdemonx> so it is worth it to prestiege?
[0:50:31] <%Niney_Who> Ye
[0:50:31] <+JordantheKitty> @xmetalicdemonx honestly you do it mostly for the cosmetics
[0:50:33] <@SoFarFetched> @LVDoomien SeemsGood you're welcome.
[0:50:36] <+JordantheKitty> blood sword is cool
[0:50:37] <%Aleate> otzBlush otzBlush otzBlush
[0:50:40] <@PlagueOfGripes> ( no )
[0:50:41] <%superc37> well then youre fucked
[0:50:50] <$Quiet__Viking> Nurses Calling is really strong with PH
[0:50:52] <meatman_noplan> Otzdarva is a very good DBD player
[0:50:55] <+not_draven> you cant really treat ulcers that easily my guy
[0:50:56] <Daskolin> Or if you play for long ass time and you are completionist
[0:50:59] <theloganbrand> I see you did the konami code
[0:50:59] <%Emperor_Machinus> @PatStaresAt Any tips on playing nurse?
[0:51:00] <%ashenfrenzy> oh bloody PH looks great wow
[0:51:10] <Daskolin> Otzdarva is wholsome
[0:51:11] <%Agami23> gonna run a extreme trial for the first time. wish me luck
[0:51:11] <horse_disguised_as_horse> Classic PH
[0:51:14] <@SoFarFetched> you can feeeeel that texture
[0:51:15] <%Taisuru> WHY DID THEY NERF HIS ASS
[0:51:18] <%Niney_Who> But where's Assless Chaps Pyramid Head
[0:51:19] <%ragingbrachy> normal is cooler. i like the white gloves
[0:51:20] <dapperskeleton69> extra grimey from his time in the FGC
[0:51:31] <Coystick> His hospital gloves are the unsung heroes of his character design
[0:51:32] <+NitronStreams> Someone left their dorito man out in the rain
[0:51:36] <%Kataguro> Nurse really doesn't need to be stealthy though
[0:51:41] <%DedlokPM> @Taisuru they didn't. They buffed his clothes
[0:51:42] <+JordantheKitty> ok but which legion character is your favorite
[0:51:52] <%ragingbrachy> a baby amount
[0:52:01] <+konekoryugamine> Oh god please no
[0:52:02] <%azure22900> Never will.
[0:52:03] <%Niney_Who> Do it fuck it
[0:52:05] <%azure22900> Fnaf
[0:52:06] <+konekoryugamine> Please no
[0:52:07] <%Kataguro> @JordantheKitty Better be Susie
[0:52:09] <@SoFarFetched> yeah
[0:52:09] <@PlagueOfGripes> the rabbit one I think?
[0:52:11] <Discount_CJ> FNAF yeah
[0:52:11] <%MaritimeSpanker> its a dead dude in a suit
[0:52:12] <dapperskeleton69> DONT
[0:52:13] <+konekoryugamine> NO fuck that noise
[0:52:13] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Long story short, Springtrap's kinda the big bad.
[0:52:14] <RCIRainer> The animatronic from 3
[0:52:14] <horse_disguised_as_horse> Never
[0:52:15] <%maenos2> god no
[0:52:16] <%ragingbrachy> fnaf would be great for this game fuck yall
[0:52:17] <%DaKnightWarrior> lytWINCE
[0:52:17] <%maskofmichael> It's a rabbit
[0:52:17] <+JordantheKitty> @Kataguro agreed
[0:52:18] <%Invlux> That would be a good get
[0:52:20] <+Infernal_Dalek> We already have rabbits from SH3
[0:52:20] <%Emperor_Machinus> I hope not
[0:52:20] <%Taisuru> Springtrap is the mangled fox one
[0:52:23] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt It's the Gross ruined Rabbit from the third game with a corpse in it
[0:52:24] <%superc37> yellow rabbit
[0:52:24] <x00Leon> its William afton
[0:52:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> MANEATER MILDRED
[0:52:24] <+The_Butterfly_Man> I mean if its fnaf it would just be Freddy like you know the main pne
[0:52:27] <TheReaperofGrim> I dont even know how that would work
[0:52:28] <%ChaosAethr> its a dead guy in a robot suit
[0:52:28] <%derrickslays> is that a safe camp logo on the balloon?
[0:52:29] <%driemen> I don't think fnaf would want to be associated with the other properties?
[0:52:30] <+JordantheKitty> pat if you don't think susie is best legion we're all going to mass unsubscribe and mass cry
[0:52:32] <dapperskeleton69> pat doesnt do weird furry spooky game
[0:52:33] <%MaritimeSpanker> could work only if they hide in the lockers
[0:52:36] <+The_Protagonist> Silent Hill movie tho
[0:52:36] <%KingKZ> Springtrap is a hybrid human/animatronic
[0:52:36] <BinaryBetrayer> Bring back The Desolate Hope
[0:52:37] <%xmetalicdemonx> yeah
[0:52:39] <+konekoryugamine> Yeah but the Silent Hill movies sucked uber ass
[0:52:40] <%oda_flobunaga> How about a xenomorph?
[0:52:40] <+tangoragahn> YOU HAVEN'T READ THE LORE???
[0:52:42] <%LiquidDinosaur> @PatStaresAt MANEATER MILDRED
[0:52:42] <%CygnusRoboticus> switch up the killers and survivors, 4 animatronics vs one security guard!
[0:52:43] <%Kataguro> I want Jacket from Hotline Miami more than a FNAF character
[0:52:44] <clockworknate> @PatStaresAt what about the bogeyman from homepour?
[0:52:45] <@PlagueOfGripes> oh wait, isn't it the yellow rabbit the dead killer was trapped into?
[0:52:46] <%driemen> Like Albert Wesker is more likely
[0:52:46] <Coystick> What about Sil from Species? Remember Species?
[0:52:47] <+The_Butterfly_Man> Shovel Knight comes to DBD lets go
[0:52:48] <%oda_flobunaga> or a predator?
[0:52:48] <@PlagueOfGripes> looks like shit.
[0:52:51] <horse_disguised_as_horse> People got a mad hard on for springtrap
[0:52:52] <theloganbrand> He was iconic enough to put in both movies
[0:52:54] <Xydian> Spring-trap sounds like some mousetrap shit my GF hides in her drawer so i dont go finding her toys
[0:52:55] <%azure22900> Fnaf is way too cheap and nothing but very silly jumpscares.
[0:52:57] <%Invlux> DBD is the Smash of horror
[0:52:57] <%ChaosAethr> hellrasier man
[0:52:58] <+Greywyn00> when do we get Adachi Kappa
[0:52:59] <%MaritimeSpanker> How many other good horror monsters are there? can't use AM or Shodan
[0:53:00] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt Springtrap is a Serial Killer stuffed into and haunting a Destroyed Gross Green-Dirty Rabbit Suit
[0:53:02] <+CarminesCarbine> @PatStaresAt Pyramid Head also was in the movies.
[0:53:04] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> If ANY video game monster would get into DBD, it'd be someone from Resident Evil
[0:53:05] <+JordantheKitty> @PatStaresAt konami published the jpn version of dead by daylight so there was precedent
[0:53:05] <%derrickslays> is that a safe camp logo on the balloon?
[0:53:08] <@SoFarFetched> I should have tried to sneak in to play LUL
[0:53:09] <+konekoryugamine> Yeah but the movies were shit
[0:53:09] <%Dementedpenguin> 2001 was ages ago NotLikeThis
[0:53:10] <%Kataguro> It's funny is why
[0:53:11] <%Joustar_> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[0:53:13] <%xmetalicdemonx> Darth Vader
[0:53:14] <%Invlux> You know why
[0:53:14] <BluBox> Sonic.EXE for DBD
[0:53:18] <+not_draven> bring in the abstract concept of a recession as the next killer
[0:53:19] <%Chichen> same lmao
[0:53:20] <RoboFussin> They have a Bill. It's a wash :)
[0:53:21] <%Tallie> think theres ever gonna be a xenomorph kinda in the vane of demogorgon
[0:53:22] <Xydian> It's so you can be really immature and be 11 again
[0:53:22] <%maskofmichael> Why DOES killer wait time gotta be so long?
[0:53:23] <%Treuan> It's universally better to turn it off
[0:53:23] <+JordantheKitty> lmao it's true pat, it's funny but you're right
[0:53:24] <blink289> man ive been loading as killer for a while and you still got it before me
[0:53:24] <%honeyman18> that does seem pointless
[0:53:25] <+konekoryugamine> Because MMP
[0:53:27] <theloganbrand> Sometimes people are nice
[0:53:27] <lunaraci> It's fun to let the toxicity go rampant
[0:53:28] <@SoFarFetched> so you can at least say "GOOD GAME"
[0:53:28] <+konekoryugamine> Wha
[0:53:29] <+The_Butterfly_Man> I give GGs and give advice to new players
[0:53:30] <+konekoryugamine> HUH

[0:53:44] <%Tallie> Thanks for the PrideShrug @campfire_chronicles
[0:53:46] <%DedlokPM> Springtrap is a fucked up and weathered combo animantronic and body suit of the Rabbit Character with a dead guy in it @PatStaresAt
[0:53:47] <%Niney_Who> I honestly think Springtrap could be possible IF Scott is fine with the level of Gore and Violence this game has. Hard to tell if he's like a Normal Christian or like the kinda Christian that made Doom
[0:53:49] <%Kataguro> Thanks for the PrideToucan @campfire_chronicles

[0:56:49] <gruulmagebeast> is there any downside really to charging rites of judgement while you walk around?
[0:56:51] <Discount_CJ> Do the Konami code on the hook
[0:57:03] <+JordantheKitty> pat why is your setup so comfy looking
[0:57:06] <%Dementedpenguin> 2 hooks before a gen pops is not bad
[0:57:08] <+bmj614> I never had to to read TweetLonger in my life as compared to this week! Is it the same for anyone else?
[0:57:13] <RCIRainer> "Am I winning, son?" "You're doing great Dad!"
[0:57:15] <@PlagueOfGripes> do you think pyramid head has little treats in his helmet, or a gerbil waterer
[0:57:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> @JordantheKitty GAMER CUBE
[0:57:25] <%patriotrenegade> but theyre gone now
[0:57:28] <@SoFarFetched> The helmet is probably just a giant horsefeedr
[0:57:31] <%Dementedpenguin> true, it can turn quickly >_>
[0:57:32] <%Pilzkun> how're you folks today
[0:57:33] <@SoFarFetched> horsefeeder*

[0:57:44] <BinaryBetrayer> The pyrammid has a horsefeeder inside.

[0:58:24] <+The_Butterfly_Man> @Treuan he couldn't think of the perk so i was saying ruin? meaning is that which perk he was thinking of
[0:58:28] <%ashenfrenzy> so are the rites time-limited or is there a set amount that can be out? they can't last forever right?
[0:58:33] <%Kataguro> Right into the Torment
[0:59:07] <%ItsCaptainDisco> What's your ultimate dream character set for this game?
[0:59:16] <Daskolin> @PatStaresAt Btw you can watch otzdarva for Pyramid head tech(like using drag animation to hide basic atack animation)
[0:59:25] <%azure22900> Bit like ruin but reverse.
[0:59:27] <%Kataguro> Pat, it's like a reverse NOED. You're giving yourself time early to put pressure on everyone
[0:59:28] <Azathotic> I can't believe Smash has more pedos than the Arcana Heart communityu
[0:59:30] <faintsmile> all in a group
[0:59:34] <%Dementedpenguin> Bill what was that
[0:59:39] <+NitronStreams> rip bill
[0:59:46] <+The_Butterfly_Man> yea thats the reason I don't really run it, aleast ruin you can defend your perk before loosing it
[0:59:47] <RoboFussin> Oh Bill atpCap

[0:59:49] <%MaritimeSpanker> Poor bill

[0:59:58] <%DaKnightWarrior> die bill lytALRIGHT

[1:00:21] <%ragingbrachy> i swear every bill player gets fucked on on pats streams
[1:00:40] <%DaKnightWarrior> You got fight in you...i like that.
[1:00:42] <Frogwash> What's the crown thing?
[1:00:43] <%argavus> Never realised until a few weeks ago you can kick the generators
[1:00:44] <TheReaperofGrim> They're luring you away from the gens
[1:00:53] <horse_disguised_as_horse> Free hook
[1:00:59] <%ragingbrachy> confetti :)
[1:01:11] <$evermoore_hex> thanks to the crazy stacking of bloodpoint gains im finally making all of my survivor's perks teachable
[1:01:17] <%MaritimeSpanker> you know, come to think on it
[1:01:23] <+tangoragahn> Remember to slug for pressure
[1:01:24] <@PlagueOfGripes> well, can't pretend he had a choice there
[1:01:25] <%CygnusRoboticus> does PH not have the glowing vision cone?
[1:01:25] <gruulmagebeast> dang pyramid head has got some decent reach
[1:01:27] <%Kataguro> The range on the ground wave could be longer
[1:01:28] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Good job
[1:01:32] <%MaritimeSpanker> I've never once seen a Quinton player in the game
[1:01:34] <@PlagueOfGripes> either run forward and die or run backwards and die a second later
[1:01:37] <%Dementedpenguin> @Frogwash an anniversary thing. if a survivor gets one and survives the match, they can wear the halo. except licensed characters. Killers just have to find them and complete the match
[1:01:40] <%MaritimeSpanker> nor have I faced off against plague either
[1:01:45] <%MaritimeSpanker> odd.jpg
[1:01:53] <@SoFarFetched> I think no one really likes Quinton,especially since his character seems to be low tier.
[1:01:53] <skrewarrior> how do you win the game?

[1:01:58] <%MaritimeSpanker> okay, that was not meant to be a link

[1:02:39] <%Dementedpenguin> PH is trying! BibleThump
[1:02:39] <cascadepersona> Clipped his leg a bit, it's fine
[1:02:40] <%DaKnightWarrior> poor Dave
[1:02:40] <@SoFarFetched> You can "win" by getting everyone killed.
[1:02:44] <%DedlokPM> Right by a hook too mogsLUL
[1:02:45] <%MaritimeSpanker> @SoFarFetched I could see that. Dave I see plenty, because he has good perks and a decent set of customs, and claudette for the same (plus for blend)
[1:02:48] <%superc37> how do you do the finishers as a killer?
[1:02:49] <%oda_flobunaga> how bout Gogo Yubari as a killer?
[1:02:53] <RoboFussin> Oh damn, didn't know you could execute em
[1:02:56] <faintsmile> what
[1:02:58] <%Niney_Who> MAD OMEGALUL
[1:03:06] <Daskolin> @PatStaresAt Caging is anti save or anti DS tech
[1:03:08] <gsoto83> whats with that icon on her head?
[1:03:09] <+Loinclothiclese> @superc37 you have to have an item called a mori
[1:03:18] <%Gogogolem> hit them with the David Cage.
[1:03:18] <%superc37> ah
[1:03:22] <@SoFarFetched> The Crown is part of the Event for DbD anniversary
[1:03:29] <%zeif00> Range add ons?
[1:03:30] <+Loinclothiclese> @superc37 you have the item and hook 2 times and then you get to kill outright
[1:03:34] <+JordantheKitty> i can't see how many gens are left taggAAA
[1:03:34] <faintsmile> lmao bill
[1:03:36] <T_Sasquatch> whats the better cage to use , johnny or nicholas ?

[1:04:51] <dapperskeleton69> BILLLLL
[1:04:57] <%azure22900> Yeah the name is still bugged
[1:04:59] <%Chichen> i think he either DC'd or let himself die
[1:05:00] <%Gogogolem> The ghost face perk "I am All ears" is good on pyramid head cause you can see people you're chasing through walls.
[1:05:29] <gsoto83> Sounds like a good coffee blend @Gogogolem
[1:05:32] <T_Sasquatch> why does he cleaver look so tiny
[1:05:45] <+JordantheKitty> because increased fov
[1:05:48] <+JordantheKitty> because of his perk
[1:05:50] <BinaryBetrayer> It's upside down, that's the handle
[1:05:59] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Who would you rather see as a killer in this game - Alien or Predator?
[1:06:00] <RoboFussin> LUL
[1:06:00] <%Kataguro> Whomp
[1:06:01] <%Chichen> @T_Sasquatch thats the handle. the blade is in the ground dragging along

[1:06:24] <%Kataguro> Blind but for ears
[1:06:25] <+JordantheKitty> did someone key the hatch?
[1:06:27] <@SoFarFetched> gotta listen for the "WOOSH"
[1:06:28] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> that whooshing is the crown i think
[1:06:33] <marisot_lemonade> hatch roulette!
[1:06:36] <T_Sasquatch> It just looks tiny when raised up after the trick shot LUL
[1:06:37] <%superc37> so deaf?
[1:06:40] <%Kataguro> I think you heard PH breathing
[1:06:42] <%Joustar_> DEFEATED
[1:06:42] <%AncelDeLambert> thank you, survivor, for wearing a HIGHLY VISIBLE cosmetic
[1:06:44] <%ragingbrachy> gg
[1:06:47] <ZeeJiggle> @dapperskeleton69 Next hook will kill them and they have to be tormented
[1:06:47] <Daskolin> @PatStaresAt Sound bug. Sometimes you can hear surviviors and hatch from other side of the map
[1:06:47] <%gespenst25> t90GG
[1:06:49] <gruulmagebeast> now i want pyramid head doing capn americas lvl 3 from umvc3 except its called final judgement

[1:07:29] <%ragingbrachy> cant roll bloodwebs im guessing
[1:07:42] <ZeeJiggle> Lightborn to properly RP the fact there's no eyes to blind.
[1:07:46] <@SoFarFetched> not good choices LUL
[1:08:00] <%Maysus> whispers is good
[1:08:13] <Daskolin> @PatStaresAt whispers are amazing with intevention
[1:08:28] <horse_disguised_as_horse> whispers is good on other killers
[1:08:31] <+hightiermortal> pet the catto
[1:08:34] <%Maysus> I just find that it saves me time from looking places where survivors aren't there
[1:08:41] <%MaritimeSpanker> Pat, have you played mirror Micheal?
[1:08:46] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Pat, please tell Elmo I love him please
[1:08:49] <%Kataguro> Whispers is really good on like Doc
[1:08:49] <%Maysus> depends on killer, tho. yes
[1:08:52] <Daskolin> @PatStaresAt Also endgame when you need to watch gates with 1 survivor
[1:08:54] <$Quiet__Viking> Nurse's Calling is really strong on PH
[1:08:54] <%animaturgy> Thats fair
[1:08:59] <%Joustar_> no
[1:09:04] <Azathotic> You know it works in a cone, right?
[1:09:05] <ZeeJiggle> That would be crazy strong, but I get it.

[1:09:20] <%Maysus> yeah nurse's calling is awesome for PH
[1:09:30] <NeoCre> Sweaty boah
[1:09:38] <Shimano232> The best use i've had for whispers is when the last survivor is trying to get a door open. just stand at the door until whispers turns off.
[1:09:43] <clockworknate> being p.h sure makes one sweaty lol
[1:09:59] <$Quiet__Viking> It so good Because you see the Auras when they're standing still
[1:10:01] <%Maysus> @Shimano232 I use it for that a lot yeah LUL

[1:26:16] <%MaritimeSpanker> @Klownkommander ah, thank you!
[1:26:20] <%JumboCrunchies> It took me an embarrassingly long time to realize that you can level a killer without playing them, if you really want their perks.
[1:26:20] <yeetdabsenpai69> oh
[1:26:21] <%CanniTwitch> Remember not to upgrade Discordance! It's actually more useful at Rank 1

[1:28:03] <yeetdabsenpai69> i do remember hearing that atleast
[1:28:06] <%NitotheBurrito> @patstaresat Sweet, I'll start leveling all those ones up, cause I need perks really bad. Matchmaking at rank 10 has been kicking my ass
[1:28:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt I just bought this game What is the most essential DLC
[1:28:20] <yeetdabsenpai69> so i'm not just dumb ut also have an hazy memory
[1:28:27] <%Kataguro> It's true
[1:28:29] <%NouveauPunk> I find I do much better with Pyramid Head if I just ignore the ranged attack most of the time, I can never land it in a chase.

[1:28:44] <%demon1103> @doc_ock_rokc you play survivor or killer?
[1:28:44] <%zeif00> Would psaBig recommend NotOtzdarva for killer guides.

[1:29:20] <%Kataguro> They're same difference. It's understandable
[1:29:23] <%MaritimeSpanker> if you plan to try out The Shape/Myers at some point, see if you can get Bamboozle
[1:29:30] <+Superspider51> he's searching up a list of the killers on google while he has an in game list with pictures
[1:29:33] <@PlagueOfGripes> a guy released a good "most fun killers" video that covered a lot 2 days ago
[1:29:34] <%MaritimeSpanker> since he has the quickest speed of vaulting, it makes him much much faster
[1:29:38] <Brainworm205> Get whatever DLc you think looks interesting. I recommend all of it tbh
[1:29:59] <%Kataguro> Nightmare has Fire Up, which can be fun
[1:29:59] <%Klownkommander> @doc_ock_rokc leatherface has the most useful perk killers can get. BBQ&Chili is useful and can double your co at max

[1:31:14] <Naho_Saenoki> @Mekhet09 Just perks, otherwise they're just skins.
[1:31:16] <%Klownkommander> @mekhet09 they may as well be skins outside of perks

[1:32:20] <legacy0117> Harhar.
[1:32:24] <%zeif00> Corrupt is great for forcing survivors into you.
[1:32:32] <%Mendin> Smart survivors hide behind the CI generators and just wait that first minute and change
[1:32:35] <%Maysus> its great
[1:32:49] <Brainworm205> Corrupt Intervention makes three gens unusable for the first couple minutes of a match

[1:40:14] <%patriotrenegade> HAX
[1:40:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt its a lag cheat they cause you to not be able to do things
[1:40:15] <yeetdabsenpai69> what do you mean?
[1:40:16] <+goldenwerewolf> It's not cheats it's just smart plays
[1:40:18] <+TheNewZealandStory> survivors were doing this to me the other day
[1:40:19] <%Chichen> just cage him

[1:40:29] <Morbidmort> It's a cheap move where you us delay to make it impossible to go somewhere, I bet
[1:40:30] <SainEdge> or just a bug?
[1:40:33] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt No survivors can make their body blocks huge by running in a circle.
[1:40:33] <shiroiookami856> havent seen that ever, smells fishy cheesy
[1:40:34] <chambatron> If iot was cheat
[1:40:36] <%candyboogers> candyboogers subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[1:40:40] <%Mekhet09> yes.
[1:40:41] <%Fooguwu> body blocking from 5 feet away?
[1:40:41] <+TheNewZealandStory> it feels like an exploit
[1:40:42] <+oktavia_von> Thanks for the PrideHeyyy @candyboogers
[1:40:42] <+goldenwerewolf> What they do is stand on top of where the killer has to be to hook, so you can't press the button until she leaves
[1:40:44] <%ChaosAethr> it toxicity
[1:40:48] <%MaritimeSpanker> watch the toxicity go into 11 after the game, I swearve
[1:40:48] <%Chichen> i think so lol
[1:40:49] <@StridentSong> It's a high level survivor tactic where you bodyblock the hook from being used, to buy time for the person being carried to get free
[1:40:52] <%azure22900> Clear as day it was a cheat
[1:40:54] <%MaritimeSpanker> almost always with players like this
[1:41:02] <%Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt Isnt "Gotta Cheat" a mantra of yours?
[1:41:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> @goldenwerewolf They patched that so the killter can place at any angle
[1:41:12] <clockworknate> if it was lag they wouldnt have been messing around like that
[1:41:19] <%KingKZ> They patch PH's ass but not that?
[1:41:28] <shiroiookami856> but he was too far away to get bodyblock
[1:41:36] <+goldenwerewolf> @doc_ock_rokc They still magnetise the killer to a specific spot for the animation, that spot being blocked = no hook prompt
[1:41:52] <%sexdrugsvideogames> pyramid head?
[1:41:57] <%ChaosAethr> HANG
[1:42:23] <Morbidmort> @shiroiookami856 That's the point. By moving a lot in a small area, the inherent latency of online stuff makes your occupied space is big but your hurtbox is small
[1:42:24] <@SoFarFetched> Pat will poop on everything if he has to
[1:42:28] <%Thewoodentree> oof
[1:42:35] <SomeOtherNeb> even if he doesn't have to
[1:42:40] <%DaKnightWarrior> nice
[1:42:54] <$joylent_blue> especially if he doesn't have to
[1:43:04] <%apostateCourier> apostateCourier subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! I picked up DBD a couple weeks ago because of you and I am greatly enjoying my time as a triangle. I'm glad they entirely removed his ability to block cage rescues by making the thing yeet itself to a random spot on the map if he tries to body block it.
[1:43:14] <%CygnusRoboticus> do you think the killer reuses the same hook hole out of courtesy?
[1:43:18] <%Campfire_Chronicles> need a cosmetic that turns PH trail brown
[1:43:38] <%MaritimeSpanker> I still wish that clown was better than he actually is
[1:43:46] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> did they just 3gen themselves
[1:43:56] <gsoto83> was that a two-4-one?

[1:49:10] <%zeif00> Think Devour Hope would be good on PH?
[1:49:10] <%Maids4lyfe> cats love being fat
[1:49:10] <%NouveauPunk> @Remery_ Man Dwight the coward was impossible for me. I tried a bunch of times and just gave up.

[1:52:03] <penitentpentwitch> The whole PH Butt in a nutshell: The cloth was bugged and wedged in his crack, showing off his cake. The cloth was fixed, the cake was hidden, so people thought it was removed. It's the same slice, just covered.
[1:52:07] <fuzzy_snake> Corrupt intervention for early pressure and whispers to find them fast
[1:52:10] <%MaritimeSpanker> is the doctors anti-gen skill decent?

[2:07:00] <CandyCoatedConfection> @liquiddinosaur the one from the freddy remake
[2:07:03] <$Moave> @DaKnightWarrior What did he say? I just found out.
[2:07:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> @delilah4you Michael Myers' real superpower is that he is an excellent driver despite having been in mental institution since he was 6
[2:07:08] <%ABigPinkLion> the min max PogChamp

[2:07:20] <@SoFarFetched> @Moave "dont touch kids"
[2:07:21] <%MrBorisMakarov> what's that aura around pats vision
[2:07:24] <Weeabooninja> what's the fartgas on the edge of the screen?
[2:07:27] <%delilah4you> i thought that was weird form the original hallyween
[2:07:32] <Psych_man13_13> Man, im still hoping they put Pinhead in the game
[2:07:37] <+Remery_> Undectable auro
[2:07:42] <+Das_Prints> They did a good job with Ghost face as well. Freddy‚Äôs original design was a bit more true to his movie powers but it made him terrible from a gameplay standpoint.
[2:07:51] <$Moave> @SoFarFetched You know what. That is probably the best thing anyone could say about it
[2:07:52] <dseok14> Their canned screams always crack me up
[2:07:57] <robodash> robodash subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:08:02] <%JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> fart aura means they cant hear his terror radius or see his red cone
[2:08:04] <+Superspider51> Pinhead, Chucky, A Xenomorph, Francis York Morgan and the Raincoat killer
[2:08:14] <CrimsonFox777> JUDGEMENT
[2:08:16] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Psych_man13_13 now that Pyramid Head set a precedent for non-standard hooks, Pinhead could summon a bunch of chains and shit
[2:08:25] <%CygnusRoboticus> are there any wilhelms in this?
[2:08:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> Patrick Bateman
[2:08:32] <$joylent_blue> PH didnt do his morning lunges
[2:08:37] <%DaKnightWarrior> @moave he just made a light joke about it.
[2:08:41] <%CursedNobleman> aww LUL
[2:08:41] <+Das_Prints> It would be cool if they put in The Thing and figured out ways to make it work like the Spy from team fortress 2.
[2:08:45] <%emperordread> emperordread subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 6 month streak! I have no special message or rant to give - so just a thank you to Orb, Elmo & Paige for making the months of hiding from the C virus much more tolerable

[2:09:33] <%manwithboxonhead> What
[2:09:34] <%NitotheBurrito> 'merica
[2:09:35] <Morbidmort> @Das_Prints Maybe have Mac of Keith David's character as the survivor
[2:09:37] <Morbidmort> *or
[2:09:39] <conflict1914> hang her from the party hook
[2:09:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Campfire_Chronicles that's dumb as hell but i will only mildly hate them if the idea is they're going to completely isolate themselves for >2 weeks

[2:09:51] <%CJett92> people from Alabama are barely real people

[2:11:02] <%blaggablag> Sir, Joke larsony is NOT A JOKE
[2:11:03] <$joylent_blue> the last podcast title was literally a stolen joke!
[2:11:03] <+Das_Prints> @morbidmort having both Macready and Childs as survivors would be funny because you could then have a possibility of the two of them being the last ones alive on the tram and you reenact the final moment of the film.

[2:15:08] <%blaggablag> it looks like such a fancy jaunt he carries
[2:15:13] <$Quiet__Viking> A good stealth perk is Dark devotion, it makes it so if you hit the obsession it gives them you'r terror radius for 30 sec
[2:15:39] <+RowenCleric> I like how PH looks like he has a happy jaunt in that victory screen

[2:15:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hey i'm also new what dlc is a must have for killer or survivor?
[2:16:11] <%trekkie11041> RED BAR MOUSE
[2:16:23] <penitentpentwitch> Grab the perk so it's out of the pool?
[2:16:29] <$joylent_blue> Savages4Blood try this -> ***
[2:16:29] <crazypsico55> cannibal for bbq and chilli if you want to be a killer main
[2:16:33] <%delilah4you> Pat, which killers do you think most accurately represent the characters in their franchise?
[2:16:34] <+Das_Prints> Leveling Leatherface to get BBQ and Chili as a teachable helps a bit since it ups bloodppints and is good on almost every killer. Whether you like playing him is a different story.
[2:16:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> you could do The Hills Have Eyes but that seems uh.......not thematically okay
[2:17:06] <%jjolion> I wasn't looking and thought your were snorting coke off your mouse

[2:25:01] <%delilah4you> it seems like that energy has HELLA range
[2:25:02] <+InEzrealwetrust> D strike is an ability that allows you to escape the killers clutch after being hooked
[2:25:06] <%SharKinStereo> Pat's mouse is borked
[2:25:08] <%californaya> are you allowed to fuck with pallets before they get thrown down?
[2:25:09] <+CayreI> You have a backup mouse, right?
[2:25:09] <fuzzy_snake> No it might be dbd, it has a host of odd mouse issues
[2:25:09] <%arcielardor> has to go outside to get a new one!
[2:25:16] <%SirGO0SE> Dusk be like, "oh you dont want to use a mouse? okay"

[2:25:29] <Aydarkzero> do you ever get downed as a killer or just stunned?

[2:25:42] <%CJett92> thats just dirty LUL

[2:25:43] <%DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[2:25:46] <@SoFarFetched> Yui though has a perk where you can reset a pallet,but I believe it has a cooldown on when you cna do it again.
[2:25:47] <%Arazien> @InEzrealwetrust Big thanks for explain
[2:25:52] <%Kataguro> Until they give a survivor a gun
[2:25:53] <%BayowolfTerra> Less then a minute
[2:26:02] <Aydarkzero> nice
[2:26:03] <@SoFarFetched> can*
[2:26:03] <+InEzrealwetrust> eh, if i didn't someone else would here
[2:26:12] <$joylent_blue> @Savages4Blood i was able to get it to work on my phone by opening *** in a browser, its a bit awkward since you leave the twitch app but it works
[2:26:19] <+It_sjustjoey> Jukes
[2:26:22] <%BubbaRands> jukin and jiving
[2:26:24] <%CJett92> theyre learning
[2:26:35] <%californaya> why are they glowing with fairy energy
[2:26:37] <+Das_Prints> It‚Äôs still funny that Ash is a survivor. If there was any survivors out of the cast that would have a chance against the killers it‚Äôd be him.
[2:26:39] <%BubbaRands> best meg
[2:26:40] <%CJett92> or Pat just sucks, its 50/50
[2:26:44] <%ha2ken> Pat is a villain that gets off on their successes
[2:26:52] <$Dakuu75> I feel like since ALL the survivors know engine-repair, at least ONE of them would be able to create a make-shift gun from junk
[2:26:55] <@SoFarFetched> @californaya it's when you grab the crown for the DBD event going on right now. Except only way to get the crown for survivors is having it and escaping with it alive.
[2:26:59] <%delilah4you> yeah ash being a survivor is so weird because he's not the run scared kinda guy
[2:27:14] <%californaya> @SoFarFetched danke
[2:27:14] <%ABigPinkLion> The good thing though is when a survivor wastes all those pallets the next one is easy
[2:27:29] <%DaKnightWarrior> that move lytFILTH
[2:27:32] <%ABigPinkLion> like that
[2:27:33] <@SoFarFetched> Worse thing is when someone throws all the pallets down for no reason. Had that happen while I was a killer and felt confused.
[2:27:33] <%delilah4you> I feel lik ebecause of the entity, any guns the survivor tried to craft would just not work, because thats not "part of the game"
[2:27:54] <%CJett92> mmmmmmmmmmmmmmGOTCHA BITCH
[2:27:54] <%DaKnightWarrior> PH looks super fun.
[2:27:55] <gsoto83> BANK SHOT!

[2:28:39] <+kamig92> Does anyone have any good guides to read up on how the sub-systems work like auras and stuff like that? I played the game before so I main stuff I understand, just not like auras and whatnot
[2:28:40] <gsoto83> bet thats paige on a smurf account
[2:28:41] <%ha2ken> It's true...girls loved being chased
[2:28:41] <@SoFarFetched> maybe she's being the lure
[2:28:44] <$joylent_blue> waves her butt in your face
[2:28:48] <%TheWinged7> Just like Peaches
[2:28:48] <yeetdabsenpai69> also possible the killers are gunproof
[2:28:53] <%delilah4you> juke that
[2:28:57] <yeetdabsenpai69> cause entity
[2:29:21] <%delilah4you> yeah I'm sure there are some killers that GUN would just not work on
[2:29:22] <%weissguard> You know, I kinda respect it.
[2:29:28] <gsoto83> rivers of DOO DOO
[2:29:31] <%delilah4you> Like, the spetre, no fucking way a gun would work on her
[2:29:32] <yeetdabsenpai69> is paige playing
[2:29:42] <yeetdabsenpai69> was that peach?
[2:29:43] <@SoFarFetched> I mean I assume gun wouldn't work if they are all in some kind of purgatory thing.
[2:29:48] <%californaya> "that's a nice shitfest" - the reason I watch Pat/Paige
[2:29:49] <+kastev> I don't know how Pat can play KB/M with the keyboard on his lap
[2:30:06] <Aydarkzero> isn't Pat playing on the cube?
[2:30:11] <%delilah4you> Thats how I used to play games
[2:30:12] <$joylent_blue> LUL
[2:30:12] <%Starotter70> Were Neon colored clothed put in as a trap?
[2:30:14] <%delilah4you> Until I got a proper desk
[2:30:21] <gsoto83> Hey, what happened to the gamer cube?
[2:30:23] <%delilah4you> ok bye meg
[2:30:24] <$serpenttucker> I'm more inclined to believe that guns should have been flashlights, and just suggest that killers cannot get killed by them
[2:30:30] <$joylent_blue> his arm is on a part of the cube, but not he keyboard
[2:30:34] <%BubbaRands> ded
[2:30:47] <$serpenttucker> But then that might encourage traitorous behaviour
[2:30:48] <%delilah4you> there ARE flashlights
[2:30:50] <%delilah4you> you can start with them
[2:30:53] <%delilah4you> They stun the killer
[2:30:56] <%CJett92> no, girl, hide BEHIND the tree
[2:31:01] <gsoto83> yeah, but the rest of the cube?
[2:31:02] <$Dakuu75> that bright green shirt isn't doing her any favors
[2:31:08] <yeetdabsenpai69> they might also not have the resources
[2:31:09] <%delilah4you> TO CAGE IWTH YO
[2:31:16] <%californaya> yo what, you can just kill them?
[2:31:19] <+Patch4747> PrideWave
[2:31:20] <@SoFarFetched> It's funny that the best tip for survivors is "wear dark clothes"
[2:31:23] <Aydarkzero> Pat only brings out the full cube when it's gamer time
[2:31:26] <Savages4Blood> what does the cage do on here I havent seen it befire
[2:31:28] <+Das_Prints> @serpenttucker also I‚Äôd imagine counter play for guns would be different than flashlights where the killer just has to look away.
[2:31:30] <+SundanceShot> into the shame cube
[2:31:30] <$joylent_blue> might as well have big neon lights strapped to her shirt
[2:31:31] <%californaya> oh, what

[2:31:53] <gsoto83> (i'm lying, i'm much spooked
[2:31:57] <crazypsico55> @Savages4Blood Its a type of hook but the survivors have to do quick times and if failed they die
[2:31:58] <yeetdabsenpai69> @aydarkzero ye
[2:32:00] <%delilah4you> Yeah, PH can just send them to the cube
[2:32:01] <%pectusumbra> what was the name of that horrible bed enemy from SH2?
[2:32:02] <%Taisuru> @Kataguro It's new
[2:32:03] <%ashenfrenzy> @Aydarkzero if you facecamp the cage they teleport far away on the map
[2:32:15] <Aydarkzero> woah nice
[2:32:20] <%Kataguro> Sick. That makes him even cooler
[2:32:22] <%arcielardor> so what is that open goo pit Pat keeps leaving?
[2:32:23] <$serpenttucker> @Das_Prints it's possible then that it could be incorporated in a later update. I do feel like guns are as much of a staple of the horror genre as flashlights
[2:32:33] <%delilah4you> well, she try
[2:32:47] <$joylent_blue> pat's taint trail
[2:32:49] <%weissguard> Unfortunately for the survivors, but that one Meg using every palette under the sun kind of screwed them over late game.
[2:32:49] <%californaya> Nice-u
[2:32:50] <+Das_Prints> Getting people‚Äôs bear trap to pop on pig is also pretty fun if you can pressure them enough to make it happen.
[2:32:57] <%Starotter70> You did it

[2:33:37] <%ABigPinkLion> SourPls
[2:33:38] <%DedlokPM> @Savages4Blood just an alternate hook that you don't have to pick up and move the survivor to. Lessens the risk of flashlight saves and escapes via survivor perks but at the cost of not proccing perks that trigger when hooking somebody and some map control because you can't control where the survivor goes to

[2:36:13] <+Das_Prints> @serpenttucker the main thing is does is save you time since that and the cage mean you don‚Äôt have to carry them to a hook so you can just deal with them and go on to chase their teammates.

[2:36:55] <+Das_Prints> Although since the cage puts them far away from you sometimes it will just spawn the cage near distant survivors who immediately free them so it‚Äôs not always worth it to cage.

[2:37:20] <Savages4Blood> @patstaresat you are good at this! who do you recommend I use as a killer? so far I only use Eli but I am good at it. also if you happen to have any suggestions on survivors, I know nothing.

[2:38:07] <+Titanium__Falcon> You have a logitech mouse? the logitech software has a calibrator for the sensor to the surface you use it on
[2:38:09] <$Dakuu75> as a professional streamer, I'm sure he has back ups...
[2:38:09] <%arcielardor> use Paige's mouse

[2:41:13] <$Dakuu75> Use a controller
[2:41:14] <gsoto83> Always have a back up for the back up so you have time to replace it
[2:41:15] <%michingmallecho> I just use a wired mouse
[2:41:18] <%Agami23> pat no one told me ff14 had sexy snake women. what else are people holding out on me with for this game??
[2:41:18] <%worldbrand> almost every mouse ive ever had has had its click switch wear out, i'd look into getting one that is a 10 minute repair job
[2:41:21] <@PlagueOfGripes> I panic every time the game puts me back into the red ranks
[2:41:21] <%YakumoYomi> I bought a pair of mice on Amazon recently for around $10.
[2:41:24] <Vaardvark> In a pinch, I wouldn't want to be caught without my tertiary backups
[2:41:24] <+BigDumBeak> use paige's?
[2:41:24] <%Taisuru> Stream the backup backup buying
[2:41:26] <%marvel877> You have still sealed original controllers as back ups, but no back up mice???
[2:41:35] <%Thewoodentree> Did the driver steal it? Like Woolies food delivery.
[2:41:38] <clockworknate> @PatStaresAt Rubbing alcohol and a q tip!!

[2:42:06] <%crimsonharvest> what needs cleaned?
[2:42:06] <+Das_Prints> Someone asked this before but what killers you think they did the best on emulating their game design to match their source material?
[2:42:10] <UncleAndross_> just dump the mouse in a bag of rubbin alcohol?
[2:42:12] <%derekwst3> @PatStaresAt Blow on it, that always works
[2:42:14] <%Emperor_Machinus> Paige's mouse oozes mustard if you lift it up
[2:42:17] <whitemage4life> Have you tried the fires of Hell?
[2:42:24] <%KingKZ> Just dunk it in alcohol then.
[2:42:24] <%JumboCrunchies> Soak the whole mouse in rubbing alcohol
[2:42:27] <%crimsonharvest> done a few mouse teardowns in my time and its not fun and you almost_always_ have to buy a part

[2:42:40] <patrickvezinat> Piss on it
[2:42:42] <@PlagueOfGripes> red is 1-4
[2:42:48] <%Starotter70> Is Paige the type of person to eat over their keyboard?

[2:43:09] <%bevyrage> we've seen it happen @Starotter70
[2:43:12] <%ssjklyco> The mouse doesn't have programmable side buttons?
[2:43:14] <%BlkFlameKami> D:
[2:43:16] <+Titanium__Falcon> dunk it in alcohol lmao
[2:43:17] <%crimsonharvest> it'll have 2 screws holding it together, and you can just clean the gunk out of the switch. its likely cat hair.
[2:43:17] <whitemage4life> @patstaresat Have you tried the fires of Hell? That always works for me
[2:43:18] <%SirGO0SE> @Starotter70 you know the answer is yes
[2:43:18] <@SoFarFetched> Oh so every 4 gets different colors.
[2:43:19] <%Starotter70> Oh dear
[2:43:24] <Savages4Blood> @starotter70 we've seen her eat pickles while using a controller
[2:43:27] <%DaKnightWarrior> lytROLLWIP psaPorgmo
[2:43:28] <$RealThiele> too much dead skin, oil, and fur in the mouse
[2:43:35] <clockworknate> my mouse was double clicking all the time until i blew it real good and it stopped
[2:43:36] <%derekwst3> elmo is practicing
[2:43:37] <narusao> good boi
[2:43:38] <Khorneflakes_> cohhD gasp! does he take the batteries too?
[2:43:40] <+Remery_> @Taisuru it does, more SWF groups in red and better players and more key usage
[2:43:42] <scorilla_> @PatStaresAt have you ever tried wraith with the silent bell addon and the one that hides his terror radius/stain when he uncloaks? great for yoinking people off gens when uncloaking around corners
[2:43:42] <%SvenHolgersson> DAMN IT PAIGE

[2:44:01] <%Thewoodentree> @Starotter70 That way it still smells like McDonalds when shes done
[2:44:02] <%crimsonharvest> if you took it apart and dumped the parts in a sonic jewelry cleaner you'd probably get good results
[2:44:02] <clockworknate> yea if it needs a charge it might act up
[2:44:04] <@SoFarFetched> Too bad Wraith is low tier though.
[2:44:07] <+PlatinumRevol> hello everyone how are y'all doing?
[2:44:09] <%derekwst3> @PatStaresAt told you that would work

[2:44:43] <Savages4Blood> @patstaresat what are your thoughts on Eli? that is who I use when I play killer
[2:44:43] <%bentarcher> Pat's blow jobs cure all problems
[2:44:44] <%weissguard> Harmonica that shit!
[2:44:44] <%barrakuta371> Is Pat giving a blowjob to the mouse?
[2:44:47] <CandyCoatedConfection> omg what is happening...
[2:44:47] <%worldbrand> haha just like the NES era of 10 years ag- 20 years ag- oh no. oh no.
[2:44:47] <+waltzqueen> TILT IT
[2:44:48] <gsoto83> Pat is strong at blowing
[2:44:49] <%SirGO0SE> top that pop
[2:44:53] <%Emperor_Machinus> treat it like super nintendo cartridge!
[2:44:57] <%crimsonharvest> yes tehre is, remove the sticker and feet off the bottom
[2:44:57] <%Invlux> top the pop off
[2:44:57] <+GrayFox2510> Why not just switch to controller?
[2:44:59] <BinaryBetrayer> That sounds like a poor product.
[2:45:00] <%BinaryFireball> wow
[2:45:01] <+dante_must_die_exe> you can ALWAYS disassemble a mouse
[2:45:01] <%delilah4you> hit it with something
[2:45:01] <x00Leon> shit mouse
[2:45:02] <maybeGabby> CRAZY TALK
[2:45:03] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt yes you can,its under the rubber feet
[2:45:03] <%derekwst3> @PatStaresAt use a hammer
[2:45:04] <%delilah4you> like smack the top
[2:45:05] <narusao> i have a hammer that says different
[2:45:06] <x00Leon> need a g502
[2:45:08] <+BuriasDempsey> Dunk it in alcohol
[2:45:09] <%BinaryFireball> controller sucks for this game
[2:45:11] <%KingKZ> Sounds like you bought a shit tier mouse.
[2:45:15] <%delilah4you> the top HAS to pop off
[2:45:17] <%Starotter70> @PlagueOfGripes You know how die hard alcoholics drink rubbing alcohol? It's like that
[2:45:18] <clockworknate> @PatStaresAt you can lift up a clicker and use a can of air
[2:45:19] <@SoFarFetched> @GrayFox2510 he said he'd rather keyboard and mouse f or this. Which I don't blame him.
[2:45:20] <+dante_must_die_exe> what model mouse you got, pat?
[2:45:21] <%crimsonharvest> the screws are hidden by labels and the feet
[2:45:21] <gsoto83> Its tricky but it is true
[2:45:22] <bleugh> what mouse is it?
[2:45:23] <%CalderGaming> screws hidden under teflon feet, usually
[2:45:23] <%Promessa_EX> mouse surgury is usually easy
[2:45:25] <%Joustar_> who said that lie?
[2:45:25] <WalkerRedd> the screws are under the skates
[2:45:27] <%BinaryFireball> what mouse is that?
[2:45:28] <+RowenCleric> just rub your dick on it
[2:45:28] <%Gogogolem> You can disassempble it with a hammer.
[2:45:28] <%vaporousTippler> You can't necessarily put it back together.
[2:45:28] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt it will be under the pads on the bottome
[2:45:29] <%ladomania> just yeet it at the wall
[2:45:29] <%Arazien> Just look up a disassemble guide on youtube
[2:45:29] <%delilah4you> it its a wireless mouse
[2:45:31] <dj_arashi_rora> now putting it back together tho
[2:45:31] <%Agami23> grab it by the cord and just wing it against the wall
[2:45:33] <%delilah4you> Wait is it wireless?
[2:45:33] <%Taisuru> It's not screwed on pat
[2:45:34] <%Gogogolem> But you can't put it back together.
[2:45:36] <%Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt Just throw it at the wall really hard and itll open up
[2:45:37] <%Ynkubus18> Never said it could be put back tgether tho
[2:45:46] <%crimsonharvest> if youre gonna replace it anyway might as well turn it inside out
[2:45:50] <$RealThiele> screws hide under the smooth bottom bits
[2:45:52] <%blackjackskellington> You can disassemble anything if you hit it hard enough
[2:45:52] <+GrayFox2510> Oh, for sure. But I imagine a faulty mouse is worse than a controller.
[2:45:52] <%KingKZ> Just smash it until it comes apart.
[2:45:54] <%worldbrand> the asus gladius is designed to be disassembled so that the click switches can be replaced, and those parts are like 3 bucks
[2:45:55] <%delilah4you> is it wireless?
[2:45:56] <%SirGO0SE> i immediately saw a picture of one disassembled
[2:45:59] <%Promessa_EX> screws under feet
[2:46:09] <bleugh> oh that's a weird looking mouse
[2:46:09] <WalkerRedd> lol
[2:46:11] <+Sendrak70> They hide screws under stickers and grip pads
[2:46:11] <dj_arashi_rora> LOL
[2:46:12] <maybeGabby> ***
[2:46:13] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[2:46:14] <jonslayer0> nice
[2:46:16] <BinaryBetrayer> There should be screws beneath the pads on the bottom of the mouse.
[2:46:16] <maybeGabby> disassemble guide
[2:46:18] <%spongeofmystery> RI|P
[2:46:18] <%Starotter70> Oh boy
[2:46:19] <CrimsonFox777> What do you mean "wrong"?
[2:46:21] <%Joustar_> oh Pat.
[2:46:22] <%flumpforever> LUL LUL
[2:46:23] <@SoFarFetched> time to give that new new mouse to paige.and grab the replacement mouse from her.
[2:46:26] <comedeity> how?
[2:46:28] <gsoto83> Its not worth the effort, you probably don't have the tools to pop it without promising that the armitures wont be broken
[2:46:37] <WalkerRedd> g502 is good mouse tho
[2:46:37] <Savages4Blood> oh is it actually a rat
[2:46:45] <shruke> I love the g502
[2:46:47] <%Promessa_EX> flat heads can do anything
[2:46:48] <%Arazien> For the G903 the screws are under the pads
[2:46:48] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[2:46:48] <%Joustar_> "suddenly"
[2:46:51] <BinaryBetrayer> Because they just got endorsed by world famous streamer patStaresAt
[2:46:53] <+BeardedLuchador> because offices around the world have depleted stocks of things like mice
[2:46:53] <gsoto83> CAUSE SHIT IS BURNING TO THE GROUND
[2:46:55] <eyezehuhh> Welcome to my problem
[2:46:57] <%SvenHolgersson> Rocking one right now
[2:46:57] <%KingKZ> Market suddenly went up.
[2:46:58] <%MisterTylerrr> cause you suddenly need it
[2:46:59] <%optimasmaximas> D:
[2:47:01] <@SoFarFetched> yeah do it
[2:47:01] <%CJett92> Ive got a 502, it's fucking legit
[2:47:01] <+BuriasDempsey> probably because you keep buying all of them
[2:47:03] <%SvenHolgersson> Worth the 60 bux
[2:47:04] <%maenos2> yeah steal it
[2:47:09] <$RealThiele> almost like supply chains are fucked during a stay indoors pandemic
[2:47:16] <%BlkFlameKami> local streamer steals mouse from disabled woman
[2:47:18] <%Jekado> There are teardown videos for the G903
[2:47:22] <%blackjackskellington> What about the GNO Me, me old chum?
[2:47:23] <%Starotter70> Just tell her it's like stealing your clothes
[2:47:23] <clockworknate> is the plural of rat, rice?
[2:47:24] <+dante_must_die_exe> those little covers on the bottom need to be removed to get to the screws, Pat
[2:47:26] <%Joustar_> Check under Garbage Mountain
[2:47:29] <%Arazien> 502 is nice. I have the wired version
[2:47:32] <+Kai_Sense1> Damn pyramid head is fast
[2:47:34] <%delilah4you> what kind of mouse does he have again?
[2:47:44] <%Jekado> G903
[2:47:46] <%Jekado> logitech
[2:47:51] <%TheWinged7> @PatStaresAt tweeted at you how to take apart the G903
[2:47:54] <patrickvezinat> @delilah4you a shit one
[2:47:54] <%Taisuru> Did you know : Pat was once the most handsome boy in the land, until he became the most handsome MAN in the land.
[2:47:58] <%crimsonharvest> I repaired my razer mouse twice, but the plastic part kept wearing out
[2:48:00] <%ashenfrenzy> oh man the greed
[2:48:11] <%Wrangler117> lol was the crown worth it
[2:48:19] <%SirGO0SE> @Taisuru but he is baby?
[2:48:20] <+Kai_Sense1> psaWhat
[2:48:28] <%Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt There's a G 502 disasembly video, dont know if thats what you would want tho
[2:48:32] <Savages4Blood> make stupid choices win stupid prizes. R.I.P. Survivors
[2:48:34] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> basement time
[2:48:36] <%CJett92> @Taisuru stop simping Pat
[2:48:36] <%AnIcedCoffee> she just gave up
[2:48:36] <%YakumoYomi> Are we talking about the Proteus, Hero, or Lightspeed 502? I've been looking into getting a "gamer" mouse for a while.
[2:48:46] <%Taisuru> She thinks you won't tunnel just cause she has crown LUL
[2:48:46] <$Dakuu75> lol, good scream
[2:48:54] <%BayowolfTerra> Huh. Bluff?
[2:49:04] <bleugh> zowie fk2 is good if you have baby hands like i do
[2:49:04] <%delilah4you> yeah the screws are in the bottom, you have to unscrew it and pop it open
[2:49:12] <@SoFarFetched> Wait did she just let herself die off a first hook?
[2:49:13] <%BayowolfTerra> No just salty
[2:49:19] <%delilah4you> Weird that its a wireless mouse though, how do you change the batteries? Or does it charge on the pad
[2:49:23] <Savages4Blood> I want a metalhead survivor that when they get hooked the go BLEUGGGGHHHH
[2:49:29] <%Taisuru> @CJett92 Never
[2:50:03] <%delilah4you> Next Killer should be Rem Lezar
[2:50:16] <%Starotter70> I want Big John as a Survivor
[2:50:27] <%delilah4you> Killer is Fed
[2:50:33] <Daskolin> I wanted to launch starbound just now. Saw some mod conflicts. TFW i have 9GB of mods(892 mods)
[2:50:41] <absentking> should'nt that have gave you mori?
[2:50:44] <%CJett92> Rem lezar would be a terrifying killer
[2:50:47] <patrickvezinat> Next killer Springtrap survivor Markiplier
[2:50:47] <%Taisuru> @delilah4you For some reason I read that as Brock Lesnar to which I say yes
[2:50:48] <%Wrangler117> @PatStaresAt they get any gens yet?
[2:50:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Starotter70 the miner from the song?
[2:50:55] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Where is Paige today?
[2:51:16] <%TrevIn3Dimensions> psaPorgmo DBD stream?! fuggin sick
[2:51:21] <%Thewoodentree> @Taisuru He just F5's you onto the hook
[2:51:23] <%Starotter70> @LiquidDinosaur The boss from Dusk, "C'mon kill me! Do eet C'moon!"
[2:51:24] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> crushing it, pat
[2:51:37] <%delilah4you> lock brock lesnar would be good, but no I want Rem Lezar specificlaly
[2:51:40] <$Tuskor13> do eeeet keel me nooow
[2:51:41] <%ssjklyco> Not sure if may be it, but found a teardown link for you mouse showing how to take it apart. Understand if you don't want to but thought I'd provide something.
[2:51:59] <$Tuskor13> @delilah4you I read that too fast and thought you said Lock Bresner
[2:52:04] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> wow is that 2 for 2 on hook
[2:52:11] <%AnIcedCoffee> i miss being in the comfy ranks
[2:52:15] <%delilah4you> From within your mind no one else can find the light that you inspire. From another place not from outer space but SOMEPLACE EVEN HIGHER REM LEZAR!!!
[2:52:18] <%TrevIn3Dimensions> what is Pat's character holding exactly? an axe backwards?
[2:52:18] <%luckysteak> why are they shiny?
[2:52:29] <%TrevIn3Dimensions> OH
[2:52:30] <%TrevIn3Dimensions> nvm
[2:52:32] <%delilah4you> its a big sword Trev
[2:52:33] <+kamig92> I find it really hard to go back to playing Starbound after finding out that so much of those devs never got paid and never will
[2:52:39] <%Taisuru> @TrevIn3Dimensions Giant Knife, he drags it
[2:52:39] <%weissguard> Next killer should just be the voice from Catherine that says Edge.
[2:52:45] <$Tuskor13> it looks like the pyramid head sword but a weird angle
[2:52:46] <+Das_Prints> It‚Äôs funny when you do snipe someone on the gen with that and they freak out and use a nearby pallet.
[2:52:52] <%TrevIn3Dimensions> is he pyramid head?
[2:52:59] <%ItsCaptainDisco> @kamig92 For real?
[2:52:59] <mobiusnightshade> It's weird how Pyramid Head kicks down palettes instead of just slashing them in half.
[2:53:01] <%DaKnightWarrior> yes
[2:53:03] <%Taisuru> Yes
[2:53:10] <Ipsenscastle> big whiffs
[2:53:17] <%TrevIn3Dimensions> gotcha, thx chat psaUp psaUp

[2:53:58] <%DaKnightWarrior> lytBLUSH
[2:54:05] <LasagnaXaga> Is Pat a good killer in this game?
[2:54:06] <%delilah4you> can you get both? Or does it just hit the first one in a line?
[2:54:09] <%Ranryu692> awww shit you're still streaming
[2:54:10] <+RowenCleric> Starbound had such potential too...
[2:54:11] <zamzoph> butthurt
[2:54:11] <%Scooterbug9000> LUL
[2:54:11] <%CJett92> she... wanted to die
[2:54:15] <%delilah4you> like could you have theoretically hit both of them?
[2:54:18] <%CursedNobleman> I wonder who broke it LUL
[2:54:20] <%Agami23> hopfully it gets fixed soon
[2:54:20] <%Scooterbug9000> you can get both @delilah4you
[2:54:21] <%Invlux> ya back can't take it
[2:54:21] <%MisterTylerrr> MisterTylerrr subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 22 month streak! The mouse problem is just karma for your Carlos Mencia life style.
[2:54:22] <Ipsenscastle> Pat refuses to provide further context
[2:54:22] <%EuropanLamprey> Butts Disease is a pain in the ass
[2:54:23] <CrimsonFox777> Ok Pat, you don't need to brag about your massive dick like that.
[2:54:24] <%Promessa_EX> pat, you offically helped me calm down after 3 hours of work, i am lazy
[2:54:25] <%Littlecjmajor> what happened to paige?
[2:54:25] <%Thewoodentree> Pat over here bragging
[2:54:27] <StormingRLP> Wsit, did Paige get surgery or a something???
[2:54:30] <%delilah4you> thats fucking WILD
[2:54:32] <%Taisuru> It won't be fixed for long with Pat around lytJACKPOT
[2:54:36] <$serpenttucker> shocker. Paige is still butthurt Kappa
[2:54:37] <Savages4Blood> wait what happened to paige? is she ok??
[2:54:41] <WalkerRedd> Maybe it's all that cat hair?
[2:54:45] <+dante_must_die_exe> @PatStaresAt getting a new one is easier than taking apart the g903 honestly LUL
[2:54:52] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> maybe camping hatch?
[2:54:56] <%delilah4you> we told her to start small, training takes time
[2:54:57] <%delilah4you> But nooooo
[2:54:59] <%derekwst3> pat almost never turns around, what if someone was just following him the whole time
[2:55:00] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> oh guess not lol
[2:55:02] <$Dakuu75> @StormingRLP no, she's just old'n busted
[2:55:06] <%pectusumbra> alright, going walking. have fun, and good night all
[2:55:13] <%Starotter70> Paige just woke up and broke her ass one day, been healing it for like the past few weeks
[2:55:17] <%terminallyCapriciousz> terminallyCapriciousz subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! it's my 18 month anniversary. thank you again for introducing me to so many games over the last decade that i would have never checked out otherwise.
[2:55:25] <$Tuskor13> paige is the old busted, but whos the new hotness @Dakuu75
[2:55:27] <mobiusnightshade> At least a mouse that you have to click hard feels really in-character for this killer. XD
[2:55:41] <+kamig92> I definitley want to go back and play Starbound, but hearing about how the devs got fucked over is horrible. I'm def going to need some time before I get back to that game. I highly encourage people to not buy because of that
[2:55:46] <%delilah4you> Paige is the old and busted hotness
[2:55:49] <%derekwst3> the butt transplant worked,
[2:55:51] <%Taisuru> They call her "Ms. Glass"
[2:55:58] <+kamig92> On a more positive note I bought Way of the Passive Fist based on Woolie's constant reccomendations
[2:56:16] <%DaKnightWarrior> Oh you lytSMUG
[2:56:16] <meatman_noplan> There's a funny bug where if you get somebody who's crawling out to escape with your PH kill move, they die and you fly out of bounds
[2:56:16] <%CygnusRoboticus> I need to see a pat vs paige dual stream megaevent
[2:56:23] <%derekwst3> was it catdog which had the butt company?
[2:56:48] <@SoFarFetched> Feels like they're t oo busy figuring out what to do.
[2:56:51] <$serpenttucker> @kamig92 what's this about starbound's devs getting fucked over?
[2:56:56] <$Tuskor13> does that move go through walls
[2:57:03] <@SoFarFetched> yeah it goes through walls
[2:57:04] <%BayowolfTerra> Pseudo farm
[2:57:11] <zamzoph> isn't it sometimes better to leave blocked paths blocked so that THEY are hindered by them too?
[2:57:12] <+kamig92> @serpenttucker devs didn't get paid and never will
[2:57:13] <%CJett92> Its gonna be really cool when you hit that judgement thru the wall blind
[2:57:19] <%delilah4you> its so broken
[2:57:25] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> one of those guys better be working on gens
[2:57:36] <Savages4Blood> you guys got me worried is paige ok or did something happen to her
[2:57:37] <%delilah4you> TO THE SHAME CUBE
[2:57:39] <Ipsenscastle> why is she glittering?
[2:57:41] <%derekwst3> its hard to hit, but if it hits
[2:57:46] <+FoolsArcade> why are some of the survivors being followed by Will o' wisps?
[2:57:46] <$serpenttucker> @kamig92 contract or liscense shit?
[2:57:54] <%delilah4you> she just had butt trouble
[2:57:58] <Spironito> is there a compilation of you responding to parasocial people on twitter?
[2:58:07] <@SoFarFetched> @Ipsenscastle from the DbD event,you can claim crowns and it makes you glow. But you gotta survive and escape with it to keep the crown LUL
[2:58:18] <jaxgraphix> did you ever come around to Last Of Us 2? last I saw you were not having a good time
[2:58:21] <%derekwst3> @Ipsenscastle special costume i think, it not good for using
[2:58:24] <+RowenCleric> @Savages4Blood shes is totally fine, just pulled/hurt her back/butt a few weeks back , nothing serious
[2:58:27] <%BayowolfTerra> Locker again im sure
[2:58:31] <%Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt Will you do another stream with the crew from last time?
[2:58:33] <%Wrangler117> @PatStaresAt does sending to cage proc pop goes the weasel?
[2:58:35] <Ipsenscastle> @SoFarFetched cheers
[2:58:45] <cascadepersona> @jaxgraphix I don't think he will want to return to it anytime soon.
[2:58:45] <%BayowolfTerra> No
[2:58:53] <+kamig92> @serpenttucker Publisher is saying they "Dedicated their time for free" and thus are not obligated to be compensated for their work
[2:58:55] <%CygnusRoboticus> @kamig92 TIL thanks for the info I didn't know about that story

[3:12:39] <BinaryBetrayer> So is DBD something you can throw yourself at alone to play with randos, or is better to have a group of people?
[3:12:45] <%Joustar_> No drift 4 Pat
[3:12:54] <+thackattack00> Alone is fine
[3:12:56] <%tusk102> @BinaryBetrayer you can do alone but it's more fun with friends
[3:13:01] <%lethallunacyx> perfect time to do this
[3:13:21] <%SirGO0SE> the one time i played with my friends they killed me then screen capped it, tagged me and posted it on facebook lmao
[3:13:23] <+RowenCleric> its intended for survivors to not be on voice chat actually
[3:13:35] <%Thewoodentree> @BinaryBetrayer Theres a ranking system so youll be tossed in with people your skill level
[3:13:37] <%Joustar_> whiff
[3:13:43] <$joylent_blue> @BinaryBetrayer most ppl play alone, playing with friends kinda breaks the game in some cases
[3:14:08] <nerdychef2392> yo pat i would like to get some feed back from you. so i got snd place in the gamestop FF7remake sweepstakes and got a $500 gift card to gamestop. should i try to use it for a new console or do you think gamestop will go under.
[3:14:30] <BinaryBetrayer> I'm eyeing it since it's on sale, and it feels like a community thing but I guess I was wrong. The pillar of DLC is intimidating tho.
[3:14:38] <%WhereIsWill> gottem
[3:14:51] <%SirGO0SE> @nerdychef2392 won the psaRaffle ?!
[3:14:54] <%tusk102> yeah a main problem being if you have friends with mics they might accidentally reveal themselves from a scream of fear or something among other things @BinaryBetrayer

[3:15:21] <yeetdabsenpai69> YEYE
[3:15:22] <+RowenCleric> just pick and choose the dlc you like, if you are killer the only one you need need is Texas Chainsaw massacre
[3:15:29] <%MayorRev> is there a mod that replaces survivor screams with the Howie scream
[3:15:31] <%DaKnightWarrior> lytMOTIVATED
[3:15:36] <%thesadrock> @BinaryBetrayer the dlcs you have to buy are only for licensed killers, you can get the others without paying real money its just a grind
[3:15:36] <%Invlux> PogChamp blind hit
[3:15:37] <%tusk102> @nerdychef2392 what would you spend it on right now
[3:15:55] <Savages4Blood> new survivor needs Wilhelm scream
[3:15:55] <BinaryBetrayer> Can't be worse than grinding Warframe
[3:15:58] <%thesadrock> @BinaryBetrayer and licensed survivors
[3:15:59] <nerdychef2392> I would spend it on PS VR
[3:16:03] <+Luigicow92k> I tried to play DBD because my friends have recently gotten into it, but I got too spooked in the tutorial when it said "(Optional)Don't get seen by the killer" or something and I had to go into the basement
[3:16:05] <%Arazien> @nerdychef2392 GS is like a lich and will hang on as long as they can by any means. You're probably safe to console.
[3:16:12] <%TrevIn3Dimensions> i wish the screams werent so phoned in. i know it adds to the conry nature of horror but eugh psaGoblin
[3:16:13] <LeonPup> blind
[3:16:26] <%thesadrock> @BinaryBetrayer nah its not as bad cuz you passively can unlock them just by playing
[3:16:34] <Savages4Blood> rekt
[3:16:34] <%ha2ken> Bad move
[3:16:38] <Sitromxe> Tried to donate. Streamlabs says no. Sorry.
[3:16:45] <%MayorRev> I wanna hook a survivor and have them make the funny Wilhelm sound
[3:17:04] <BinaryBetrayer> Replace it for the Goofy scream
[3:17:05] <Savages4Blood> I still cant figure out how to donate on mobile lol I suck
[3:17:10] <%tusk102> @nerdychef2392 i say buy the console when it comes out. Better to have the new gen console then the current gen vr
[3:17:11] <$joylent_blue> gamestop is probably gonna hang on till new console launch at the very least
[3:17:19] <+RowenCleric> i dont play survivor but I think the only survivor that is good to purchase is Bill?, maybe?
[3:17:20] <%CJett92> I'm just gonna donate my appreciation instead
[3:17:25] <%Thewoodentree> Every round should have randomized public domain sound effects for everything

[3:17:57] <augusta_wind> m o r e
[3:17:58] <SleepySamsquanch> Gamestop will hold on for dear life until after the consoles launch this year so that the company can line the pockets of the executives on the board. It's going to be millions for them.

[3:18:19] <LeonPup> 1800??!!!!!
[3:18:20] <comedeity> a costco hotdog pls
[3:18:21] <%tusk102> Especially because the current gen vr price will probably drop in price when the new console comes out since it would then be the "obsolete system"
[3:18:22] <LeonPup> HOLY SHIT
[3:18:32] <+Loinclothiclese> jesus christ pat why
[3:18:32] <nerdychef2392> Thank you everyone for the comments. I was think console since its a large amount of money
[3:18:34] <$Dakuu75> Can your body actually keep up with these speeds, Pat?
[3:18:36] <%Promessa_EX> man that's so not gamer
[3:18:36] <%ssjklyco> 1800 is what I have due to my TV size
[3:18:39] <%toolofparanoia> pat got them doom reflexes
[3:18:48] <LeonPup> do you mean 800 DPI?
[3:18:50] <%SirGO0SE> @SvenHolgersson 1 hot chip pls
[3:18:56] <%Promessa_EX> so you're the reason in game sensitivity is always rediculously high by default
[3:18:59] <SomeOtherNeb> HONK
[3:19:05] <Fenlig> Does this game not have controller support?

[3:19:41] <Savages4Blood> HONK!!!! why would you do thattttt
[3:19:41] <%tusk102> @nerdychef2392 yeah the console is gonna be 500. Though if you get the wireless 400 dollar version you could use that 100 leftover to try and help pay for the vr
[3:19:50] <%Arazien> People are wild. I play on 2400
[3:19:57] <%tusk102> @nerdychef2392 i meant the disk driveless 400
[3:20:01] <cryptidmimikyu> make sure you tell everyone in game that your mouse wasn't working so they know you're a cool guy

[3:23:35] <%ssjklyco> A hoard of Mice
[3:23:35] <%thesadrock> @tusk102 tunneling is an overused term for survivors, what it is is when you just focus on one survivor and ignore the others even when you have other options
[3:23:36] <%SirGO0SE> put them in a cage and keep them as pets

[3:23:57] <+BuriasDempsey> What if they all just break over time in their packages and you won't know till its too late?
[3:23:59] <%tusk102> So tunneling is basically saying "fuck this guy in particular"
[3:24:01] <%Theycallmenerf> Hi @avery484 !
[3:24:04] <@SoFarFetched> pretty much
[3:24:05] <%Thewoodentree> The mouse stopped beacuse he kept trying to feed it cheese
[3:24:09] <clockworknate> @SvenHolgersson some jeans please!
[3:24:14] <%apostateCourier> @PatStaresAt if you're bulk buying mice, could you write that off as a business expense? :v
[3:24:15] <@SoFarFetched> survivors hate when you're focused mainly on them and not others.
[3:24:16] <%thesadrock> tusk102 yeah basically
[3:24:21] <%SirGO0SE> what if i want a villain?
[3:24:23] <+NitronStreams> BRANDING
[3:24:33] <%IDTheftVictim> Tunneling is saying if I kill one guy then there are only 3 people running around ruining stuff
[3:24:38] <%BubbaRands> We're ALL heroes
[3:24:41] <@SoFarFetched> Have you never heard of Mighty Mouse?

[3:24:58] <AliceAstro> someone never watched an americal tail
[3:25:06] <%thesadrock> because its a cool word for gamers
[3:25:06] <trianglehat> because of the hero sensor Pat
[3:25:07] <%bevyrage> Rats of Nimh, Mighty Mouse, Redwall, Humblewood
[3:25:08] <%BubbaRands> Was it made by Bonnie Tyler?
[3:25:13] <+Remery_> Mice aren't your hero Pat?
[3:25:15] <%thesadrock> not to be confused with gamer words

[3:25:40] <SleepySamsquanch> How many mice do people go through?! I've used the same for 5+ years...
[3:25:45] <%BayowolfTerra> Problem is dividing attention equally leaves 4 in the game longer, so a little tunnelling does help

[3:26:17] <%Starotter70> Jesus
[3:26:18] <%ssjklyco> Considering you used to buy a bunch of new playstation controllers to have new inbox, I'm surprised you don't have a bunch of mice already
[3:26:20] <%SirGO0SE> to remember them by
[3:26:24] <%thesadrock> cant wait for cross play so queues get shortened (hopefully)
[3:26:25] <%Arazien> Pat, get a box to put your stuff in man
[3:26:25] <$Tuskor13> i mean elmo is a cat they eat mice
[3:26:26] <$Dakuu75> sounds like you should just buy a dozen of a mouse you like
[3:26:26] <%Joustar_> ???? Christ Pat.
[3:26:32] <Profmcstevie> Show us the graveyard, we must see the dozens of mice you've lost
[3:26:32] <%BubbaRands> it's gotta be strong and it's gotta be fast and it's gotta be fresh of the fight Kappa
[3:26:33] <TheFramedWarlock> 3 or 4 months ? Jesus
[3:26:37] <%TheCrispyBoi> the fuck do you do to your mice?
[3:26:39] <CurrySauseBandit> At least it isn't like. 14 shitty mice in a year. Been there done that shit.
[3:26:39] <%lethallunacyx> sounds about right
[3:26:48] <%JayWubs> JayWubs subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[3:26:51] <$Tuskor13> just put them somewhere
[3:26:52] <%SirGO0SE> that checks out
[3:26:52] <+kamig92> I have a perfectly good working Logitech G502 Mouse I've had since 2015
[3:26:53] <%Niney_Who> Pyramid Head is Dad but Demogorgon is Daddy
[3:26:54] <AliceAstro> so dont
[3:26:55] <$joylent_blue> oh....
[3:26:56] <karovus> i felt bad replacing my mouse after 3 years...
[3:26:56] <%SomersaultJustice> cats love mice
[3:26:57] <%IDTheftVictim> Queues aren't as bad for survivors, i think the ratios for roles are slightly off
[3:26:57] <shurtal> Elmo is a spiteful son
[3:26:58] <%TheCrispyBoi> LUL
[3:26:58] <%mMayrro> leave them somewhere else 4Head
[3:27:00] <Aydarkzero> just don't leave them out 4Head
[3:27:01] <%thesadrock> cats do like hunting mice
[3:27:03] <$Tuskor13> pul like a box over it or something
[3:27:03] <%Joustar_> Fuckin' build a house with all the mice Pat destroys
[3:27:05] <clockworknate> @PatStaresAt Lift up the mouse part where you click as high as you can and blow into it , has to be high though.
[3:27:06] <Robot_Nixon_> Maybe you should tell Elmo they're not real
[3:27:08] <+NitronStreams> You need to put pictures of dogs on the mice so Elmo gets confused
[3:27:09] <%BubbaRands> Just like cat's do
[3:27:10] <%Arazien> Fuckin bourgeoisie mouse man
[3:27:11] <%Starotter70> psaGib

[3:27:23] <Aydarkzero> NotLikeThis
[3:27:23] <%Emperor_Machinus> Hide the mice?
[3:27:23] <%Ranryu692> Is it you?
[3:27:24] <ZeeJiggle> Elmo, stop leaving mice around
[3:27:24] <%colouroftheiris77> And you guys want a dog???
[3:27:30] <%mMayrro> pat don't talk about your sister like that
[3:27:30] <%Aeoneth> THe plot thickens
[3:27:30] <%Joustar_> The Paige Tax
[3:27:30] <%ssjklyco> It's all the other red heads fault
[3:27:32] <%delilah4you> you should get a trackball mouse, dont take up a lot of space, super sturdy, I've had this one for 10 years now
[3:27:37] <mikesapartment> elmo plays dbd?
[3:27:39] <%Promessa_EX> it is a cat's job to destroy mice. that's why i no longer use wires
[3:27:39] <%Niney_Who> Elmo spawns the mice
[3:27:40] <%Theycallmenerf> Tupperware container with a lid?
[3:27:41] <%BubbaRands> So Paige knocks them over?
[3:27:42] <SleepySamsquanch> A lot of mice abusers in this chat. Kappa
[3:27:44] <%CappuccinoGuil> A certain someone? Oh my god, Pat, did someone break into your house to ruin your mice?!?!?!
[3:27:46] <%Thewoodentree> @Arazien Bourgeoisqweek?
[3:27:48] <Savages4Blood> @patstaresat what killer do you recommend to someone who has only played as Eli but does well at it

[3:28:03] <%Emperor_Machinus> Elmo leaves them around and Paige knocks them off
[3:28:06] <%Arazien> psaUp
[3:28:07] <%dinnydanny777> So what did these people do to get hunted by Pyramidhead
[3:28:12] <@SoFarFetched> LET THEM EAT CAKE
[3:28:14] <%SirGO0SE> man ive been hooked on saltybet again
[3:28:14] <blksheepknt> why not just buy logitech in bulk? Like wholesale numbers and keep a bin full and just grab one as they break like a drummer
[3:28:19] <%mMayrro> tell us and maybe we can confirm :)
[3:28:20] <%Joustar_> Been there NotLikeThis
[3:28:25] <Savages4Blood> it is a team effort between paige and elmo
[3:28:25] <%dinnydanny777> Did they spit on someone's food
[3:28:27] <chaumiester> But you've been using it constantly for.... online shopping everyday
[3:28:28] <+Remery_> ALL THE CAKES
[3:28:33] <%IDTheftVictim> They all dated Triangle Girl
[3:28:38] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> my cards never leave my wallet
[3:28:39] <%tusk102> Pat said a certain someone and you could almost hear a mustard bottle hit the floor in the distance
[3:28:50] <+Remery_> Triangle Girl skin would be nice
[3:28:50] <clockworknate> Every time I pull it out and start blowing people get confused and awkward about it
[3:28:56] <@SoFarFetched> and slam
[3:28:58] <$Dakuu75> triangle girl gives the WORST head
[3:29:07] <%dinnydanny777> Pyramidhead is very fleshy
[3:29:20] <%tusk102> wait did i get gifted a sub without noticing
[3:29:25] <%BubbaRands> Kreygasm so fast
[3:29:29] <%tusk102> oh god
[3:29:32] <%dinnydanny777> I can't believe he holds his sword backwards what a fucking weaboo
[3:29:48] <$Dakuu75> damn, that survivor is THICC
[3:29:48] <%dinnydanny777> Pyramidhead uses reversegrip
[3:29:50] <%SirGO0SE> everything is falling apart today period
[3:30:00] <%logoth_> Pyramid Head holds his sword like Starkiller
[3:30:02] <+anthonywilde1994> did any1 see the blood splat on the pellet?
[3:30:04] <%MisterTylerrr> Seems like you're playing pretty well, all things considered
[3:30:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> @dinnydanny777 it's a massive sword, it'd block half the screen if he held it normally LUL
[3:30:17] <%MisterTylerrr> Nevermind
[3:30:24] <Kratok> Pyramid Head holds his sword like... Pyramid Head
[3:30:30] <Kratok> :o
[3:30:34] <clockworknate> thats how p.h holds it
[3:30:35] <%Thewoodentree> @CappuccinoGuil Nah he just really likes Berserk
[3:30:47] <%BubbaRands> Jane Romero

[3:31:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> @Thewoodentree bet you he's one of those losers that think Griffith did nothing wrong
[3:31:24] <%tusk102> @SoFarFetched thanks for the gifted sub i missed the notification while i was getting food oop
[3:31:33] <%Thewoodentree> @CappuccinoGuil lol
[3:31:46] <%dinnydanny777> I'm pretty sure Pyramidhead actually drags it behind himself with his forehand he doesn't reversegrip it
[3:31:49] <@SoFarFetched> @tusk102 I haven't gifted in awhile,so it must have been from when I last gifted during Ori LUL
[3:31:52] <BurdRightsActivist> bad character tbh smh
[3:31:52] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> These DBD streams are my favorite part of the week

[3:32:11] <yeetdabsenpai69> getting*
[3:32:20] <%thesadrock> @PatStaresAt use the trick i showed you at pallets and loops so that they step on your trail or you hit them with the sword, very hard for them to counter
[3:32:30] <%Partialrecall2> thicc
[3:32:39] <Weeabooninja> God, she got a dump truck
[3:32:45] <%dinnydanny777> That female survivor groans like a man
[3:32:48] <clockworknate> hit her with the projectile and sliced but she doesn't go down?
[3:32:50] <%BubbaRands> Kreygasm JANE
[3:32:54] <%tusk102> @SoFarFetched LMAO i was only in that stream for like 10 minutes pft. Guess thats why it says i have 14 days left

[3:33:38] <tictoc_clock> dc?
[3:33:39] <%thesadrock> yeah its tricky when you first try it
[3:34:12] <@SoFarFetched> I believe gifted subs goes to those who are at least following the twitch channel. Because I've definitely been given subs to twitch streams I haven't watched in a long while.
[3:34:14] <Silent_Fyraena> Knifey

[3:35:59] <@SoFarFetched> Meg just sounds like she's trying to do karate moves while on the hook
[3:36:05] <BinaryBetrayer> Mister Lordi would make a cool killer in this.

[3:38:00] <%DappercatEsquire> It just occurred to me I don't know what "winning" looks like in this game
[3:38:03] <+G_Thunders> Pyramid head‚Äôs been doing this for like 25 years now, he‚Äôs tired
[3:38:08] <%tusk102> @BurdRightsActivist pat whiffs at
[3:38:09] <CloniiCory> Yeah sums up my sessions too...
[3:38:15] <Silent_Fyraena> PH *does* look sad there :P

[3:38:30] <%BubbaRands> Pat stares at everyone's ass as they run away LUL
[3:38:33] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> hey pat's, whats devotion by your player level for
[3:38:33] <+Remery_> Big strides
[3:38:34] <%tusk102> AND YOU LOST
[3:38:37] <%kiiiirsten> rank two more like rank poo
[3:38:37] <@SoFarFetched> cause you need to get better psaDab psaDab
[3:38:38] <%Thewoodentree> Deck stacked
[3:38:40] <%Arazien> Getting dunked on by them too
[3:38:44] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That would be a little unfair.
[3:38:46] <%KingKZ> So that's why they bodied you.
[3:38:51] <%Tallie> i have to play against rank 2 survivors and im a level 14 killer , just that time of the month lol
[3:38:51] <%Bonte__> Smells like a 4 stack
[3:38:52] <%thesadrock> thats some good ranks LUL
[3:38:54] <$RealThiele> welcome to primetime, bitch
[3:38:59] <%kiiiirsten> @PatStaresAt git gud
[3:39:04] <%tusk102> pat demolished by fatass and logic
[3:39:06] <%Tallie> rank 14*
[3:39:07] <%Emperor_Machinus> That was my third match when I had just gotten the game xD
[3:39:10] <%IDTheftVictim> Aren't you using Discordance?
[3:39:10] <%JumboCrunchies> Because matchmaking is silly. Im rank 16 and get rank 1-5s on the regular
[3:39:11] <%Thewoodentree> He says taht but he was so happy to torment the noobs last time
[3:39:26] <%Aleate> I had a game yesterday where I went against a rank 13 and 3 rank 4 survivors with my rank 14 ass Clown. it felt amazing ü§°
[3:39:30] <xtremegixxr> this game + matchmaking = üí©
[3:39:31] <%thesadrock> @IDTheftVictim discordance 1 is better than the others
[3:39:32] <%Joustar_> PJSalt I can taste it
[3:39:32] <Silent_Fyraena> So is everything in the bloodweb consumable or only some of it?
[3:39:43] <%demon1103> yup...DBD matchmaking for ya. "what are ya lvl 15 killer, here's 2 lvl 5s, have fun XD"
[3:39:48] <%BayowolfTerra> I say 3k is a win, 2k is a draw. But i know others differ.
[3:39:53] <GenerallyAHorriblePerson> Play survivor?
[3:40:03] <%IDTheftVictim> What does it do as it ranks up?
[3:40:07] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt So what does "winning" look like in this? How do you know a round is going well?
[3:40:10] <UltraComboSupremeVictory> this game is probably better, but friday the 13th are where the waifus are at. Kappa
[3:40:16] <%tusk102> pat HATES it
[3:40:19] <+Remery_> Rub gen, open gate, leave Survivor is so boring
[3:40:19] <%SirGO0SE> number nine
[3:40:22] <+anthonywilde1994> new killer angriest pat
[3:40:45] <%IDTheftVictim> new killer the leprechaun
[3:40:46] <mikesapartment> e6s is the new a11s
[3:40:47] <%thesadrock> @IDTheftVictim it lowers the time the gen that is worked on by 2 is yellow when it ranks up
[3:40:48] <%logoth_> Unatco? No Savage.
[3:40:48] <DeltascapeV4> DO 08S THO
[3:40:51] <%tusk102> @anthonywilde1994 he attacks with belladonnas bitch fist
[3:40:54] <%demon1103> @DappercatEsquire IMO, if someone dies, I call it a win, everything else is just icing on the cake
[3:40:54] <@SoFarFetched> @DappercatEsquire as long as you're like given the "Merciless/Brutal Killer" thing,you do fine. It's when you get "entity displeased" you know you did bad. Killing everyone feels like a bonus.
[3:40:58] <%Valask> god I miss video games, fuck grad school
[3:40:59] <%logoth_> Unatco? SAVAGE. U...Unatco? Savage
[3:41:01] <%Damien_Kova> I'm curious, Pat. Do you plan on playing someone other than PH again or you think he's your main?
[3:41:03] <%SirGO0SE> more like JOKE FARMING @PatStaresAt
[3:41:11] <$RealThiele> remember GC manuals for bonus exp
[3:41:15] <+anthonywilde1994> throws potatoes
[3:41:15] <+ItsJustHal> Im sad that this is probably the only new silent hill stuff we will get but Im glad the devs did Pyramid Head justice.
[3:41:18] <NephiStreams> @PatStaresAt adjust the sensitivity?
[3:41:23] <%DaKnightWarrior> I've just been playing my game backlog.
[3:41:25] <%spongeofmystery> Yo Pat, super enjoyed the stuff you did with DK, Shy and Ros, cheers for pointing me at their stuff
[3:41:32] <+G_Thunders> Aren‚Äôt there rumors of a SH reboot?
[3:41:33] <%lethallunacyx> in game might be a better test
[3:41:43] <%logoth_> The lower the better
[3:41:44] <%DappercatEsquire> @SoFarFetched @demon1103 Thanks. So is it more about maximizing resources/experience out of a round than it is about there being a set win state?
[3:41:52] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt have you messed with the in game sensitivity or only the mouse
[3:41:55] <%ssjklyco> Just tape some weight to it
[3:42:23] <%logoth_> Pat, what's your DPI?
[3:42:30] <+Sir_Dolphinian> usually just start at the lowest and slowly work my way up to what's actually comfortable
[3:42:31] <%Promessa_EX> i know what i like so it's easy for me. i use converters for new games
[3:43:02] <%logoth_> Man 1800 Dpi, that takes me back...
[3:43:05] <$RealThiele> TREE LAW!
[3:43:12] <@SoFarFetched> @DappercatEsquire Pretty much. Some feel it's not winning if you don't kill everyone. Personally I'm fine if I got a couple of hooks and 1-4 kills in. If everyone escapes and I still get a good amount of blood points,all fine with me.
[3:43:19] <%Promessa_EX> do a law
[3:43:20] <%Invlux> RAT
[3:43:20] <%blastazoid26> blastazoid26 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! Hey Pat, do you recommend playing classic castlevania before symphony?
[3:43:20] <%tusk102> why does "keep on keeping on" make me feel so nice

[3:43:47] <Daebunz> neatherrealm pulled it
[3:43:47] <+Fonarios> yeah they pulled it
[3:43:48] <%demon1103> @DappercatEsquire depends on how you view things, I'm happy if just one person dies, others feel like they lost if even one escapes, and some only care about bloodpoints. All just a matter of perspective
[3:43:48] <%maenos2> netherrealm pulled it
[3:43:49] <%tusk102> WAIT
[3:43:49] <%DappercatEsquire> @SoFarFetched Thanks for the info!

[3:46:06] <CrimsonFox777> Seems like nothing's been going right in the world since 2016.
[3:46:08] <Damie904> Long story short, Mr. Wizard is accused of being a Nasty Man back in the 90s with a teenager. Obviously not a good look for Evo.
[3:46:08] <%DaKnightWarrior> So much crap in the FGC right now.
[3:46:09] <%Ninestempest> there's at least 24
[3:46:09] <Profmcstevie> The Smash scene is detonating, figureheads and prominent players getting exposed
[3:46:11] <+Toshatron> THE GHOST OF MARVEL 2
[3:46:14] <%kiiiirsten> I love the discourse, cancel all gamers 2020!!!
[3:46:16] <@SoFarFetched> @BayowolfTerra Yeah it's because a lot of the victims are speaking out on twitter and once that happens. That stuff spreads and those being accused delete their twitter. Couple of Smash players have deleted their twitters already.
