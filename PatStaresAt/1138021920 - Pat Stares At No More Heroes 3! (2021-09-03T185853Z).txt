[0:15:01] <%linSP> don’t get ass stick matism
[0:15:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> yea that's what it does. makes things unfocused so you have to work harder
[0:15:03] <%Raikouija> BIGGER NEGATICE NUMBER = BAD
[0:15:04] <+fetrigon> i wonder why
[0:15:04] <%X2Eliah> Yeah that explains a lot of headache stuff
[0:15:12] <SaltyAzteca> Its like equivalent exchange
[0:15:13] <mrblitzstream> stat bonus?
[0:15:14] <%X2Eliah> hyperfocusing = always tension
[0:15:18] <AMajorTom> Same here with the numbers on a card
[0:15:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> but it's lazy
[0:15:24] <%X2Eliah> aw great

[0:15:26] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[0:15:27] <+fetrigon> wait what
[0:15:28] <%bevyrage> so you're walleyed?
[0:15:29] <cherrycottontail> I had astigmatism for 20 years and then it just disappeared
[0:15:30] <%UvBenServed> LUL

[0:15:33] <@Lion_kun> It's like the Sharingan
[0:15:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> bum
[0:15:35] <+shaidot> I have like -11
[0:15:36] <%RealThiele> People with a measurement of 1.5 or more typically need contacts or eyeglasses to have clear vision.
[0:15:36] <%JoshManVGH> Lazy eyes, aren't watching you!
[0:15:37] <%NCC1701Dave> Chameleon pat
[0:15:40] <+TopTieramisu> pat's got FU eyes
[0:15:41] <%bevyrage> how can both of your eyes be lazy when you hyper focus
[0:15:42] <SaltyAzteca> @secret_npc GO TO BED
[0:15:45] <%stantheman_97> tell them to do their job
[0:15:47] <%moonmintparadise> Please just wear your glasses, pat
[0:15:47] <%Daxalog> That probably explains your migrains?
[0:15:50] <%MisterRockett> Are they both lazy in the right direction?
[0:15:52] <%linSP> wall eyed pat
[0:15:53] <devanmuse> Sounds like your eye needs to get a job

[0:15:55] <%JoshManVGH> Like Steve Beuchime in that one movie?
[0:15:56] <SunsetJack> Hello
[0:15:57] <+fetrigon> LUL
[0:16:00] <AMajorTom> As goes the man, so goes the eyes.
[0:16:01] <cherrycottontail> if both eyes are lazy is that really a problem with the eyes
[0:16:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> socket
[0:16:05] <%RealThiele> fucking fish dna
[0:16:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> eye socket
[0:16:09] <Mildly_Eccentric> Pat is actually just a googly eyed sock puppet
[0:16:10] <%greasypete00> the socket?
[0:16:12] <%X2Eliah> We need robot eyes, asap. Just rip out the goo orbs and put proper cameras in
[0:16:14] <%SWFanatic> listening to pat trying to explain something technical he doesn't understand is fantastic
[0:16:14] <SaltyAzteca> Special Eyes Pat
[0:16:18] <Profmcstevie> "Pat struggles to stare at without glasses" rebrand
[0:16:21] <BigFingerRo> How could you exercise your eye muscles? Can you get eye swole?
[0:16:21] <+TopTieramisu> if both eyes are lazy, the person's the problem

[0:31:10] <+gatdragon> he also did it to get laid
[0:31:10] <CaptainBright> no, travis ain't sigma for shit
[0:31:11] <%UvBenServed> Where's the cg tiger?
[0:31:12] <SaltyAzteca> To get that Sylvia booty, yes
[0:31:13] <Daskolin> Did gief cut off Pat head and overtook his body. To overtake stream?
[0:31:17] <+pectusumbra> Also Travis is totally a simp
[0:31:18] <%RealThiele> the UwU male
[0:31:18] <immortanjoestar> im so dissapointed there is no game called goddamn superhero
[0:31:19] <%MidnightBurst12> the ideal position
[0:31:19] <%Daxalog> He seems more Omega
[0:31:20] <%Puhff> SIGAMA MAREU
[0:31:22] <%MashinChaserR> he's an alpha with a beta mentality
[0:31:23] <penitentpendant> Just reminded me of the "Ultimate Inside Joke": A picture of Admiral Ackbar next to a picture of Astolfo
[0:31:23] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Travis is a loser that continously fails upwards
[0:31:24] <%laserbeaming> he also technically kind of gets laid. Sort of.
[0:31:26] <%moonmintparadise> and desperately trying to get pussy in NMH2
[0:31:26] <%SovPho> Omega Male
[0:31:29] <Chester_goes_Berserk> travis is an omega male who trains super hard
[0:31:33] <%TheHappyCynic> Travis is the ZETA male
[0:31:34] <CaptainBright> you want sigma, it might be the MC from Killer is Dead
[0:31:35] <%stantheman_97> he's an omega disguised as a sigma
[0:31:38] <KeiPrime> the whole alphabet
[0:31:40] <bob900000> yeah
[0:31:43] <%NCC1701Dave> yes
[0:31:44] <%X2Eliah> I mean its bullshit, but yeah
[0:31:44] <%Teintstein> pack mentality stuff
[0:31:45] <%peyodogo> junk science!
[0:31:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @realthiele DELETE THAT RIGHT NOW XD
[0:31:47] <Mildly_Eccentric> remember in NH1 when he'd say Moe all the time. miss that
[0:31:48] <@commanderclaw> I'm a Lambda male, I hit things with a crowbar
[0:31:48] <%topendbuzza> that shit is not real
[0:31:50] <%moonmintparadise> yes we know it is fake
[0:31:50] <mrblitzstream> Swap your Male Status like Weapon Switching
[0:31:54] <rytisone> I know that Vergil is Alpha and the Omega
[0:31:55] <%Raikouija> I cant believe travis has kids
[0:31:59] <%DianaTheAscian> isn't that all bs?
[0:31:59] <%Agami23> yup
[0:31:59] <+tussletoes> oh yeah is this about that wolf study being invalidated by its own researcher years later
[0:32:00] <%InternetShis> And then there's the Omegas
[0:32:00] <@commanderclaw> And chickens
[0:32:00] <%NCC1701Dave> yup
[0:32:00] <%JonnyFodder> Yep.
[0:32:01] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Friendly reminder that Travis stole his brother's wife and cucked his own brother several times

[0:32:03] <%hrbeck_> who have no prior interaction
[0:32:04] <%X2Eliah> exactly
[0:32:05] <Sartastic> your mom and dad are the alpha chads
[0:32:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> oh?
[0:32:07] <%linSP> the alpha stuff is all bull
[0:32:09] <%RealThiele> LUL
[0:32:09] <Tennochief> Lone wolves are actually going to die
[0:32:10] <@Fuggins4U> Fuggins4U is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 22 in the channel! 
[0:32:10] <draca23> That Alpha Wolf bullcrap is bullcrap
[0:32:10] <@Fuggins4U> Fuggins4U gifted a Tier 1 sub to Qsmash_! 
[0:32:13] <spicyramengaming> Wolves in the wild are a single unit more than anything
[0:32:13] <KeiPrime> you think humans arent in captivity??????
[0:32:13] <%Teintstein> accidentally ironic
[0:32:14] <%TheHappyCynic> Style switch from Omega to Sigma
[0:32:14] <%SovPho> wolves in the wild don't conform to hierarchy and the dude that did the research discovered that within months of his initial paper
[0:32:15] <%hrbeck_> It's literally wolf prison
[0:32:16] <goatcommander717> they will die if they don't work together
[0:32:18] <%Puhff> Humans also dont do that
[0:32:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> might end up in a body bag
[0:32:19] <Tennochief> Lone wolves are actually miserable
[0:32:19] <@commanderclaw> You say that like humans live in a natural state
[0:32:20] <Blank9> so it's more applicable to humans than wild wolves, got it
[0:32:21] <xeros720> wild wolves are really team oriented
[0:32:22] <%RealThiele> i wanna die gues you are in charge now alpha wolf
[0:32:22] <%Agami23> yeah actual wolves are cool to each other
[0:32:23] <%SWFanatic> ah yes, the wolf pack uncertainty principle
[0:32:24] <themightyseptopus> but we're depressed and in captivity
[0:32:24] <%greasypete00> Lions do it tho
[0:32:25] <%Raikouija> Wolf packs are a mom dad and their children
[0:32:26] <%bevyrage> it's kind of like how rat society only happens when they're in captivity and not in the wild or an urban environment
[0:32:27] <%Qsmash_> @Fuggins4U thanks for the sub!
[0:32:29] <SaltyAzteca> We truly were the Jin-Roh, Wolf Brigade :(
[0:32:29] <+shaidot> But what if humans are also depressed and in captivity in our society /s
[0:32:30] <%NCC1701Dave> dude, so true
[0:32:34] <%SovPho> by the time he published a new paper, the damage was done and it's like his biggest regret
[0:32:34] <%stantheman_97> oh yeah that was bullshit by a guy that didn't know what he was doing
[0:32:35] <DoubleRrico> like the shamu flacid fin lie
[0:32:35] <%linSP> wild wolves are just families
[0:32:37] <%moonmintparadise> yes but whoever unironically calls themselves a "Alpha Male" literally does not care about any of that
[0:32:41] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Seems legit
[0:32:41] <+tussletoes> like the researcher himself has said it's BS
[0:32:42] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Modern day Capitalism made humanity into captive wolves,  makes sense
[0:32:42] <%NCC1701Dave> but idiots have money
[0:32:42] <%anAngryHamster> wolves just stick with the nuclear famil
[0:32:44] <@Spydurman> kinda like the vaccine causes autism bs
[0:32:44] <mrblitzstream> so SHEEPS that wanna be "WOLVES"
[0:32:44] <%JoshManVGH> That guy also backdown his own study
[0:32:45] <%afronooch> psa1guy
[0:32:45] <BigFingerRo> IT AGREES WITH MY OPINIONS SO IT IS FACT
[0:32:46] <Tennochief> Lone wolves are females that have been kicked out
[0:32:46] <conchthechimera> Alphas are mommies and daddies.
[0:32:47] <lazerscraper> oh no
[0:32:54] <Chester_goes_Berserk> oh man that crap autism vaccine study killed so many
[0:32:56] <immortanjoestar> thats beta mentatilty pat
[0:32:57] <%logoth_> SIGMA MALES

[0:33:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[0:33:03] <draca23> Most Wolf Packs are usually just a bunch of parents taking care of cubs
[0:33:05] <bob900000> so is Joe rogan a beta?
[0:33:05] <%Puhff> Fuckers just hear Alpha and think it means best or something
[0:33:05] <Mildly_Eccentric> how can you be so brave to say something so controversial yet so true
[0:33:06] <%Teintstein> it's a flex
[0:33:08] <%hrbeck_> wolves can't read and they fuck
[0:33:10] <SaltyAzteca> Thats for the NEEEERDS
[0:33:10] <%bevyrage> Gaston was an alpha male
[0:33:10] <%JoshManVGH> He tried to get his own book pulled from shelves but it was too popular
[0:33:12] <%Teintstein> "read it for me bitch"
[0:33:12] <mrblitzstream> LUL LUL LUL
[0:33:13] <%NCC1701Dave> get them to do it lol
[0:33:14] <@Spydurman> oh no I'm reading chat right now
[0:33:15] <rytisone> brain damage comes with the teirtory
[0:33:16] <%Puhff> Yeah being an idiot tends to help with that
[0:33:16] <Frogwash> What, you want another mans thoughts in your head?
[0:33:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> read it for me
[0:33:17] <xeros720> it's just people wanting to defend their shitty behavior
[0:33:20] <%bravebravesrobin> NERDDDSSSSSSSS
[0:33:21] <%Raikouija> Its cause theyre compensating for something
[0:33:23] <%moonmintparadise> A Alpha KNOWS
[0:33:24] <%peyodogo> i cant read :)
[0:33:24] <%stantheman_97> can i be an epsilon male?
[0:33:24] <goatcommander717> this alpha, beta stuff is star signs for guys
[0:33:27] <%Agami23> hey pat, i know a wolf based SCP you might like
[0:33:28] <%linSP> I can’t read
[0:33:29] <%Teintstein> "what's that sign say NERD"
[0:33:33] <%InternetShis> Okay but what is a Zeta Male
[0:33:33] <%bravebravesrobin> Biggest Onga Bonga
[0:33:35] <%TheHappyCynic> hey @patstaresat apparently some stories came out and the Stanford Prision Experiment was actually coached. the prison guards were coached to be abusive making the actual experiment somewhat null.
[0:33:35] <%RealThiele> give that alpha his horpste he'll be fine
[0:33:37] <KeiPrime> real idiocracy energy: why you trying to read that? you a f..riend or somethin
[0:33:42] <%NCC1701Dave> The world is an 80's movie
[0:33:46] <draca23> "You're a beta cuck!" is coming to mind...
[0:33:50] <%CodyKnowsNothing> Yep, he's  been trying to fix that for forever
[0:33:50] <xeros720> @InternetShis a gundam pilot
[0:34:00] <deadinsideman_> "why read when i can do" - probably
[0:34:00] <spicyramengaming> If anything, a true alpha would be someone who works efficiently with others and lifts others up to be the best they can be, to make the group stronger as a whole.
[0:34:01] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt are usb-c microphones good, or do you must have XLR?
[0:34:11] <SaltyAzteca> Yeaaaaah dont do that
[0:34:12] <penitentpendant> Money first, then stream
[0:34:12] <%topendbuzza> retain
[0:34:25] <immortanjoestar> pat is scared of competition
[0:34:25] <xeros720> goddamn, anyone successful in streaming has been streaming for like 8 years
[0:34:28] <%moonmintparadise> Don't quit your 100k a year job to beg logan paul for a job
[0:34:29] <%Raikouija> Work first streme fun
[0:34:31] <%Daxalog> Internet jobs are what you do when it does well AS your doing your normal gig.
[0:34:33] <mrblitzstream> @penitentpendant Big Facts LUL
[0:34:33] <%RealThiele> consistency matters
[0:34:38] <bob900000> what until you male more than your original job
[0:34:42] <%Monkeyweed21> oh sweet I didnt miss the gameplay
[0:34:44] <+tussletoes> don't PLAN towards online content making as your career you need a plan B at the very least!!!
[0:34:47] <%Teintstein> bank on bussy, never on chat
[0:34:51] <%greasypete00> streaming could literally die next week if something happened and onlyfans almost did die
[0:34:57] <%Meekest> Pat you should offer 500 dollar classes on how to become a streamer like Logan Paul
[0:34:58] <mrblitzstream> Side Hustle this tilll you can do it Full Time and Live of IT
[0:35:00] <nochejunior> Omg the Logan Paul thing
[0:35:02] <xeros720> you really have to do it for fun and then it'll become something later
[0:35:02] <@commanderclaw> Why kill yourself when you can kill the Karen who wants everything in two bags but for them to not be heavy?
[0:35:05] <%linSP> when you find your co-workers only fans and she tells you to unsub
[0:35:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DONT SELL THE BIKE SHOP
[0:35:21] <xeros720> i think the more common story is you get good at editing and stuff and then you get more standard employment with that experience
[0:35:21] <%TheHappyCynic> @x2eliah usb mics often have noise and gain issues but generally are easy to use and cheep. XLR mics are more complicated but usually have better durability and gain, and are often cleaner sounding. it's whatever you personally need.
[0:35:32] <mrblitzstream> DONT SELL THE 40 ACRES AND A MULE
[0:35:36] <%coward_man> wait until you are making the same amount on your internet job from your real job for like 6 months before you quit
[0:35:36] <%Agami23> alot of people suggest a GOXLR for another choice to the mixer
[0:35:37] <Kindred_808> Christ, 10yrs already
[0:35:37] <%RealThiele> 1. go viral 2. dont not go viral 3. sellout
[0:35:37] <+r_squared1672> just quit your 100k/yr job and beg Logan Paul for a job
[0:35:41] <AMajorTom> And if you’re starting now you lack first-mover advantage.
[0:35:54] <%Puhff> Woolie also recommends the Blue Yeti to start out. Seems pretty standard
[0:36:01] <%greasypete00> goxlr is supposed to be very good but it's pretty expensive for starting out
[0:36:22] <mrblitzstream> @r_squared1672 Man thats dumb what  a chode LUL LUL LUL
[0:36:24] <%anticrust> anticrust subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months! why
[0:36:32] <+tussletoes> i recommend soulbrothanumbuh3's voice actor guide to figure out what kind of equipment you want to get
[0:36:35] <%X2Eliah> "TheSw1tcher"
[0:36:38] <+twohitgood> 3 words
[0:36:42] <deadinsideman_> is mine good?
[0:36:45] <%maenos2> thesw1tcher
[0:36:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BallerSwagBro9K?
[0:36:47] <penitentpendant> It needs to be distinct, memorable and easy to relay
[0:36:51] <penitentpendant> G'luck with that combo
[0:36:52] <xeros720> something you can yell in another language i assume
[0:36:53] <%linSP> not sponsored btw
[0:36:55] <xeros720> but that's about all i got
[0:36:58] <deadinsideman_> cool
[0:37:04] <%RealThiele> short, memorable, on theme
[0:37:08] <+TheAdMerlin> I've run through many tags, I like how this one sounds
[0:37:11] <+twohitgood> needs to be three words. like two best friends or pat stares at or max amillian dood.
[0:37:12] <%coward_man> it's gotta be something memorable

[0:38:05] <AMajorTom> Be careful what you make your “thing”, cause then you’re stuck with that in a very fluid environment.
[0:38:10] <%Teintstein> *you* did this
[0:38:21] <nochejunior> Ididurmom69420 is a sick name

[0:38:57] <%RealThiele> say the word bart energy
[0:38:57] <dan_g_v> and ohai chat peoples, how is it going?
[0:38:59] <mrblitzstream> LilHussie
[0:38:59] <%stantheman_97> don't stick to a specific game or genre
[0:39:01] <%Daxalog> Become a personality as HARD as you can.
[0:39:05] <%Agami23> who was that guy who fucked himself up with that? the completionist?
[0:39:06] <%Meekest> Dark Souls streamers moved to DBD
[0:39:08] <YuSlySumBich> Oh hell yeah, Pats still doing the opening, now I don’t miss any of the gameplay and can hear about papa short beards wacky takes and antics.
[0:39:09] <deadinsideman_> sticking to a series is a death certificate
[0:39:11] <%topendbuzza> don't pinion hole yourself
[0:39:12] <%moonmintparadise> dont call yourself "Fortnite John"
[0:39:14] <%DianaTheAscian> the souls people are kinda trapped
[0:39:15] <spicyramengaming> Also, don't let people decide what you play,  play games you enjoy and you will be more entertaining to watch.
[0:39:15] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat Horse Pussy's At doesnt have the same ring
[0:39:16] <%peyodogo> yo theres a fallout speedrunner named "tomatoanus" who when he went to agdq had to call himself "tomatoangus"
[0:39:18] <@Spydurman> gotta make a niche that's flexible
[0:39:18] <+nanaki_ff14> I made my name when I first for FF14 on the PS3 lol
[0:39:18] <%RealThiele> Jirard REALLY fucked himself
[0:39:21] <+tussletoes> quiet shallow has to deal with that shit a lot yeah. a lot of WF content creators
[0:39:23] <DoubleRrico> minecraft was synonymous with yogscast for forever
[0:39:24] <fantasyrabbitweapon> Hi Pat!
[0:39:28] <dan_g_v> Early stream confirms we gonna get Paige's FF stream?
[0:39:29] <+KaguraRaion> @Agami23 Yea i think it was he said he played all his favorite games first
[0:39:32] <%greasypete00> Warframe streamers mention a single better MMO and their chat goes fucking nuts
[0:39:33] <%SovPho> @PatStaresAt even IronPineapple tries to do other stuff but is like... limited to Souls-likes. It's a really scarce content pool.
[0:39:33] <%X2Eliah> Maaan, dark souls streamers literally playing random fucked up mods just to have *any* new content
[0:39:33] <%mister___doctor> Thank God Dunkey stopped doing League of Legends early on
[0:39:38] <dan_g_v> ninya?
[0:39:41] <%Ipsenscastle> being a single-game streamer seems fucking miserable
[0:39:41] <Profmcstevie> People who yell about how garbage cable TV is HATE when things don't turn out at cable TV
[0:39:41] <rytisone> he got payed a lot tho
[0:39:42] <%coward_man> stream lots of different shit right away so you don't get stuck in the trap
[0:39:43] <%Agami23> i know a muscician who had that problem. when he did music that wasent for a specific game people got mad and he ended up quitting the game team
[0:39:43] <%hrbeck_> but he does have infinite money
[0:39:45] <SaltyAzteca> Just like TF2 LUL
[0:39:49] <%Monkeyweed21> poor JIrard is cursed to ruin every game for himself
[0:39:49] <%Puhff> Nice
[0:39:49] <dan_g_v> who is ninya?
[0:39:49] <Blank9> his numbers drastic go down
[0:39:54] <%TheHappyCynic> ninja is nothing without fortnite
[0:39:56] <%Raikouija> Before Fortnite ninja was a Halo stremer
[0:39:59] <@Spydurman> Jerma managed to escape TF2
[0:40:00] <%RealThiele> yeah but hes got that fuck you mixer money
[0:40:00] <kingra> not forkknife BabyRage
[0:40:00] <%CodyKnowsNothing> Thanks for the info, Pat.
[0:40:03] <iacus_> variety is more sustainable
[0:40:04] <$OfficerMods> oh yeah the only reason i watch 2bf back in the day is that there was a video every day
[0:40:05] <+Jack8274> He literally doesn't need to work for the rest of his life, it's a hobby now
[0:40:05] <%DianaTheAscian> I forgot Ninja existed tbh
[0:40:10] <%SWFanatic> orb streaming is where its at
[0:40:10] <%AlteisenReiseZ> type casting yourself is awful
[0:40:12] <mrblitzstream> atleast its a MIXED bag of SOMETHING
[0:40:13] <xeros720> just hold a variety show before the stream
[0:40:13] <dan_g_v> oh, like a Taimanin Ninja?
[0:40:19] <%peyodogo> its also happened a bunch with spelunky
[0:40:23] <dan_g_v> with orcs and tentacles?
[0:40:24] <%DianaTheAscian> But its better in the long run
[0:40:26] <deadinsideman_> that mixer stunt prolly fucked him up
[0:40:29] <%X2Eliah> boo
[0:40:29] <bearwagon> LUL

[0:48:00] <%jinking79> best to be safe
[0:48:00] <Maids4lyfe> is that a switch joycon on Travis' glove?
[0:48:05] <sirrice77> @iacus_ what's a little oppression between friends?
[0:48:12] <penitentpendant> It really does
[0:48:13] <%EdenOfLove> One Direction was a boyband
[0:48:14] <+the22cstomp> all of these characters do
[0:48:14] <The_Legendairy> i mean Mr. blackhole said he couldn't disobey or he'd die, but yeah best fwiends

[0:48:31] <deadinsideman_> FU's definetly an improvment on fucking pizza batt
[0:48:32] <+the22cstomp> switch says no
[0:48:32] <+Vigonept> no
[0:48:33] <%topendbuzza> k-boy band
[0:48:33] <Profmcstevie> Suda everything is a band in a different timeline
[0:48:33] <simifu> yeah like steve jobs ligma, what a band
[0:48:37] <blastazoid00> Switch loading times LUL
[0:48:42] <%moonmintparadise> I fucking love weirdo names like that tho bc atleast they are unique and would make anyone confused
[0:48:42] <%SWFanatic> No More Heroes 3: "I think I can...I think I can..."
[0:48:42] <%EdenOfLove> I'm not sure if that extensive loading is on purpose or not
[0:48:45] <CosmoSire> Man, this loading screen perfectly emulates game crash
[0:48:45] <iacus_> Travis a neverwipe confirmed
[0:48:55] <YuSlySumBich> I love black nights boss fight, definitely would say it’s one of the best in the game.
[0:48:57] <lazerscraper> @sovpho nice.
[0:49:08] <%EdenOfLove> You did done it
[0:49:09] <%NCC1701Dave> ye
[0:49:12] <SaltyAzteca> I wish we could go to Speed City
[0:49:18] <xeros720> it's a loud game
[0:49:20] <%NCC1701Dave> it wants to be loud
[0:49:21] <%cooldude69xx> You were good
[0:49:21] <%greasypete00> do you think they added sounds to the loading screens to let you know if it crashed or not
[0:49:25] <%EdenOfLove> is this slow loading on purpose
[0:49:25] <%coward_man> Suda decided to crank it
[0:49:25] <%Raikouija> Holy shot travis got a trike?!?
[0:49:26] <Profmcstevie> It's all over the place as a game
[0:49:26] <+FoolsArcade> maybe Gief turned the volume up
[0:49:28] <%SWFanatic> pat inaudible, thats funnh
[0:49:30] <%gustavozxd> pat's been streaming with no audio for a week
[0:49:31] <deadinsideman_> Black night direction is definetly more memorable than matt helms
[0:49:46] <%gustavozxd> atpDance damn
[0:49:52] <xeros720> even the earlier games go really loud with some of the music and sound effects, suda likes it like this i guess
[0:49:55] <lazerscraper> 2 MEN ENTER 1 MAN LEAVES
[0:49:58] <@Spydurman> Pat's been muted all day, just Zangief streaming
[0:50:17] <penitentpendant> That toilet sidequest on the right
[0:50:18] <@Spydurman> oh no, he kidnaps space???
[0:50:25] <%gustavozxd> black knight DIRECTION
[0:50:27] <+haitakaa> kidnap me to space
[0:50:32] <%cooldude69xx> I can't believe he wouls steal space like this
[0:50:36] <+tussletoes> it's the drakengard tower
[0:50:41] <xeros720> technically, that street in Osaka
[0:50:42] <MsYakumo> Dude's a human trafficker. Lovely.

[0:50:49] <penitentpendant> I believe it's in Persona Strikers too
[0:50:50] <deadinsideman_> its actually called neo osaka
[0:50:50] <Profmcstevie> The SPEAR OF DESTINY
[0:50:51] <%HolePunchLeaf> Osaka IS a thunderdome
[0:50:52] <Cdjgamer> drakenguard
[0:50:52] <%moonmintparadise> weabo eifeltower ?=
[0:50:56] <spicyramengaming> To be fair though, this game has better framerate than the other games in the series, crazy as that sounds.
[0:50:56] <iacus_> maybe its just a replica of the one in osaka

[0:51:51] <%DianaTheAscian> Are these aliens just gonna get worse and worse? we went from smuggling to human trafficking
[0:51:53] <%SWFanatic> if its poop shouldn't it be number 2
[0:51:54] <spicyramengaming> Only this game can make me feel accomplished for unclogging a toilet.
[0:52:00] <simifu> are we all travis? monkaS

[0:52:01] <Dova573> You think Ichiban and Travis would be friends

[0:52:02] <Dova573> ?

[1:08:14] <brachydios777> Based Suda
[1:08:15] <iacus_> megazone 23
[1:08:18] <iacus_> ?
[1:08:20] <marvel877> The song changes slightly for some of these, Pat.
[1:08:21] <CaptainBright> it's most likely Zambot 3
[1:08:22] <DusK_The_Stray> The credits actually have a different remix every time.
[1:08:22] <SaltyAzteca> This is remixed
[1:08:27] <brachydios777> Remix?
[1:08:31] <+tussletoes> oh it's remixed every time? that's a nice touch
[1:08:31] <MsYakumo> Zambot 3, yeyah.
[1:08:33] <Maids4lyfe> ohhhhhhh megazone 32
[1:08:35] <Maids4lyfe> *23
[1:08:36] <CaptainBright> since Zambot is the predecessor to Gundam
[1:08:37] <%HolePunchLeaf> @gespenst_mr_ghost is this your first time seeing NMH or what?
[1:08:37] <DSD24> FU is the best
[1:08:39] <Cdjgamer> the song is remix each time
[1:08:42] <+Vigonept> megazone 23 was ok
[1:08:45] <MsYakumo> It's based on the credits theme for Zambot 3.
[1:08:48] <%InternetShis> This is high effort shitposting
[1:08:49] <%EdenOfLove> Pat don't forget to talk to your girlfriends after every boss fight
[1:08:49] <%NCC1701Dave> Love it

[1:09:01] <DSD24> Aww Bad Girl looks cute
[1:09:02] <%zanz_san> Zambot 3 is by the Gundam guy and everyone died painfully
[1:09:02] <+el_of_house_wood> @patstaresat I watched through all of these, you won’t miss any cutscenes by skipping.
[1:09:03] <%Deft_Thought> Mmmm, haven't had Miso Ramen in a while

[1:13:54] <%Puhff> That's the thing about racists: they're stupid so they reveal themselves pretty easily
[1:13:55] <spicyramengaming> Just wish I could wear the hoodie instead of a tshirt.
[1:13:55] <%Treuan> Travis come on man

[1:14:05] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Baldios? Who lives for tomorrow?
[1:14:06] <@commanderclaw> Johnny Roger, or Tim Knoxville
[1:14:07] <%Mendin> Travis never changes
[1:14:07] <Blank9> guy with sunglasses holding back of girl's head at basketball game
[1:14:09] <daniphofani> Travis's only comforting skills is anime recommendations
[1:14:09] <+Vigonept> hes an assassin whatd ya expect
[1:14:09] <deadinsideman_> HES DOING HIS BEST OK
[1:14:15] <brachydios777> What a fucking weeb

[1:14:31] <+TopTieramisu> SourPls
[1:14:32] <OldManDeckardCain> it looks so tacky LUL
[1:14:34] <willyfreshness> may be the best going down stairs animation ive ever seen

[1:14:49] <%gustavozxd> looks like it says fuck racist
[1:14:51] <%JohnAtDawn> Those are just good hoodie colors
[1:14:53] <+nanaki_ff14> Johnny Knoxville would make a great Travis Touchdown
[1:14:54] <Zeif00> The hoodie is CLEAN
[1:14:56] <%Ipsenscastle> but sandalllls
[1:14:57] <xeros720> the game believes textures are somewhat optional
[1:14:57] <metabot64> the sandals are the best part

[1:14:57] <mrblitzstream> @RealThiele LUL LUL LUL
[1:14:58] <%stantheman_97> it's so lame it fits travis perfectly
[1:14:59] <%RealThiele> this song is soooo good
[1:15:02] <Blank9> naomi became a skill tree
[1:15:06] <MsYakumo> The fact that Travis even tries says a lot about his character development since NMH1.
[1:15:08] <%EdenOfLove> The only thing i have to say is has Travis ever said anything to indicate he is progressive? Ever? Other than being sexist and not wanting to fight lady assassins?
[1:15:09] <%real_life_ghost> real_life_ghost subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Seven month subiversary! When will we get pat stares at mercenary Kings:revengance?
[1:15:10] <brachydios777> Level up
[1:15:12] <UberKingKai> Oh hey tree naomi
[1:15:13] <NeetKiller> It'd be funnier if it just said FUCK
[1:15:14] <doggieo> Its still a bit too bland but good colors
[1:15:14] <deadinsideman_> @nanaki_ff14 about that....
[1:15:17] <%Agami23> i want a really tacky reverse where its the same hoodie but the black is red and the red is black
[1:15:18] <DSD24> She's very hands off right now
[1:15:25] <CaptainBright> gods, all this NJPW references
[1:15:28] <%real_life_ghost> one sandal says 'FUCK' and the other says 'RACISM'
[1:15:28] <%gustavozxd> atpFeelsBeardMan
[1:15:28] <%AmuserName> Between Mass Effect and NMH, you should start a "Can your character wear a black and red hoodie?" gimmick twitter account. @PatStaresAt
[1:15:32] <%maenos2> LUL
[1:15:35] <SaltyAzteca> How can she suplex with no arms
[1:15:36] <%Deft_Thought> Booo Armsaults suck
[1:15:39] <penitentpendant> My friend just finished the trailer: "I can see why people would have preferred 'God Damned Super Hero.'"
[1:15:43] <Vertigheist> LUL
[1:15:44] <+healnavi> HE'S TRYING
[1:15:45] <+tussletoes> Shinobu heard that shit and went back to sleep
[1:15:46] <%AllenDeadman> Travis
[1:15:50] <+Vigonept> HE'S TRYING PAT
[1:15:50] <%TheHappyCynic> travis is a chauvinistic asshole but he's not a racist, and he does the right thing eventually. He seems to respect strength above anything else.
[1:15:51] <%gustavozxd> LUL travis is the most loveable moron ever
[1:15:51] <%NCC1701Dave> Nice
[1:15:52] <%afronooch> niche
[1:15:56] <DSD24> People love hoodies though
[1:15:59] <%RealThiele> lost your arm? I got an anime for that
[1:16:03] <brachydios777> Even though Travis is a fucking goober, he’s still way more mature than himself in NMH1
[1:16:03] <xeros720> it'd be a nice way to text character creators though
[1:16:04] <%rbakervv> @PatStaresAt make some death glove chips
[1:16:06] <@commanderclaw> What about a "Video Game Hoodies" account?
[1:16:07] <artoflec> 20 fps map PogChamp
[1:16:07] <%EdenOfLove> @TheHappyCynic That's fair.
[1:16:16] <%GalacticaPhanto> boy I miss one stream and Bad Girl and Shinobu are doing bad ooof
[1:16:18] <%arizenarkana> AS A WRESTLING NERD I'M PRETTY SURE THAT WAS ALL REAL
[1:16:26] <+the22cstomp> the frame bike returns
[1:16:33] <penitentpendant> Praise the slowdown!
[1:16:36] <CaptainBright> this is why a majority of this world's people avoid Travis: his absolute fuckton of knowledge in NJPW, anime and fucking Miike
[1:16:37] <spicyramengaming> Travis actually has a surprising amount of character growth, especially in TSA.
[1:16:48] <+nanaki_ff14> Now that was a parking job
[1:16:55] <%HolePunchLeaf> All wrestling is real, what do you guys mean?
[1:16:57] <masheshardest> just hoard until you can make good stuff
[1:16:58] <+el_of_house_wood> You want 80 chip. Helps find secrets
[1:17:01] <%okuriskyles> I knew Paul Orndoff was real, didn't know about Kiwk-kik-Lee
[1:17:08] <+the22cstomp> those are actually perfect chips
[1:17:10] <artoflec> what does ginga mean
[1:17:11] <%Agami23> every time something gets censored its because its referencing a real anime, movie, or wrestling thing.
[1:17:11] <%RealThiele> Ginger chip
[1:17:18] <penitentpendant> Kinda disappointed it's not called "Witch Chip" for the slowdown one
[1:17:19] <%MashinChaserR> Travis being a raging creep seems to be his most defining trait.
[1:17:24] <%cvp5127> @artoflec galaxy
[1:17:31] <tamale_senpai> I have arrived. :)
[1:17:32] <mrblitzstream> @artoflec galaxy
[1:17:40] <rytisone> taiga taiga taiga
[1:17:44] <%Mendin> Death Force chip was just power+ for your special moves, wasn't it?
[1:17:44] <SaltyAzteca> no
[1:17:49] <CaptainBright> Gaia chip sounds great
[1:17:53] <%InternetShis> no
[1:17:56] <%RealThiele> Gaia pretty good lookin
[1:17:59] <%TheHappyCynic> Travis isn't actually as much of a creep in TSA and 3. But he still has hangups about fighting women.
[1:18:05] <masheshardest> secrets though
[1:18:05] <brachydios777> Also, TSA and 3 Travis isn’t motivated by pure selfishness
[1:18:07] <%Mendin> Ah the Mind Goblin Chip
[1:18:08] <%Monkeyweed21> 80 Chip is a collectible finder tho
[1:18:11] <artoflec> just dont get hit and you have always attack up PogChamp
[1:18:11] <MsYakumo> Gaia chip does look prtty good.
[1:18:12] <%Agami23> or in the first cutscene with jeane, where he references god damn pickle rick but half of the name is censored to hide it
[1:18:13] <spicyramengaming> Taiga is pretty solid, actually.
[1:18:15] <%Ghufufin> MHW flashbacks
[1:18:25] <DSD24> Taiga Taiga Taiga
[1:18:31] <deadinsideman_> @Agami23 its actually piccolo
[1:18:34] <penitentpendant> As long as there's no 'drop chance' chip in this game
[1:18:34] <+healnavi> FUN BAD WANT NUMBER
[1:18:37] <%gustavozxd> yeah just don't get hit
[1:18:37] <DSD24> @Agami23 Wait I thought it was Piccolo
[1:18:41] <viewtifulr> attack go down
[1:18:42] <+Vigonept> but what if theres only 1 attack up
[1:18:44] <%TheHappyCynic> I thought the reference in the opening of the game was jean comparing himself to piccolo
[1:18:45] <@Spydurman> what about attack sideways?
[1:18:50] <Blank9> most were attack up, if do good thing
[1:18:55] <deadinsideman_> @TheHappyCynic it was
[1:18:59] <%HolePunchLeaf> apart from 80's chip, which is item finder
[1:19:01] <%coward_man> okay but that bike awesome
[1:19:01] <Maids4lyfe> but one of them was attack up when over 80% hp and you never go low hp
[1:19:02] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Everything is number
[1:19:02] <%Monkeyweed21> yea but the other ones give bigger attack up if you meet the condition
[1:19:03] <CaptainBright> then just grind for more WESN then for BIG NUMBER
[1:19:07] <Vertigheist> attack good if attack hit
[1:19:08] <SaltyAzteca> MOW IT SUPER HARD
[1:19:11] <%Agami23> i swear it sounds like theres a ick in there but if its piccolo i'd believe you all over my ears
[1:19:13] <TheLunarVibes> Any stat up is attack up if stat makes you win more
[1:19:22] <lazerscraper> NUMBER GO UP
[1:19:22] <DusK_The_Stray> time for some awesome turns!

[1:19:30] <%NCC1701Dave> bruh
[1:19:30] <spicyramengaming> One gives you a power up for light attacks, and another powers up your heavy attack
[1:19:31] <+SpiritRoads> the missions in front are the actual paying missions the npcs just give you the tutorials
[1:19:35] <lazerscraper> SICK BURNOUTS
[1:19:35] <+healnavi> MOWING GOOD CHIP BAD
[1:19:39] <%Monkeyweed21> One of those chips was like 80% more damage under 80health
[1:19:41] <%linSP> Now this is the stream content I came for!
[1:19:42] <%okuriskyles> i can't believe they still have this in the game
[1:19:47] <%Jeemukun> I should start mowing the lawn like travis
[1:19:48] <+Vigonept> do you cut grass irl?
[1:19:49] <%thedankestmeeme> That's my daily job so I hope you don't mind the critique
[1:19:50] <%okuriskyles> actually yeah i guess i can believe it
[1:19:53] <Cdjgamer> to many ruts
[1:19:57] <%MashinChaserR> A real grass act this one
[1:20:00] <DSD24> I love that little shimmy he does
[1:20:02] <%thedankestmeeme> You're goin way to slow
[1:20:13] <%TheHappyCynic> I used the same 3 or 4 chips for the entire game. they scale with your upgrades so they never really become irrelevant
[1:20:14] <%RealThiele> turn swagger
[1:20:22] <Cdjgamer> no rocks easy course
[1:20:24] <TehMud> Oh yeah MOW THAT LAWN

[1:20:31] <SaltyAzteca> That fuckin hoodie LUL
[1:20:36] <CaptainBright> man, the bold FUCK RACISM is just too good
[1:20:37] <SharkTankAgito> That turn animation
[1:20:39] <Dova573> Man lawnmowin in sandals is not a good idea
[1:20:41] <marvel877> Is that the tutorial bit?

[1:20:45] <tamale_senpai> Mass Effect 3 looks different from what I remember. Damn you EA!
[1:20:50] <OldManDeckardCain> the pose looks even dumber with that shirt LUL
[1:20:51] <%EdenOfLove> wait pat thats the same thing over again
[1:21:00] <Cdjgamer> tutorial
[1:21:00] <Zeppelee> Please tell that's not a woke hoodie.
[1:21:01] <socialistbroccoli> that hoodie is gold
[1:21:02] <%thedankestmeeme> Yeah I see it but I cut yards like that everyday thats my JOB and I gotta look GUD doing it smile
[1:21:03] <%Deft_Thought> To be mowing a lawn in a shirt that says "Fuck Racism" is a true privilege
[1:21:11] <Profmcstevie> Grass don't even fight back smh
[1:21:17] <%TheHappyCynic> Unpopular opinions: I really liked Tile in Style from nmh2. I was pretty good at it.
[1:21:17] <Psyramics> running like that is how you get an uneven cut
[1:21:20] <%mister___doctor> YEEEAGH
[1:21:23] <%RealThiele> @Zeppelee saying fuck racism isnt woke it just is
[1:21:28] <artoflec> i wouldnt wanna mow a lawn in a sweater
[1:21:33] <@Spydurman> grass shoulda been given a knife to make this fight fair
[1:21:37] <%okuriskyles> lawns are a mistake
[1:21:42] <%Deft_Thought> Lawns are a bullshit
[1:21:42] <Daskolin> Hoodie godlike. Slipers is counteract\limiter so Travis dont transcend into godhood of drip
[1:21:46] <%Grimdogx> Somebody called the Hoodie Woke unironically oh no
[1:21:49] <SaltyAzteca> "go clean the car"
[1:21:49] <%NCC1701Dave> but now with 100% more swag
[1:21:50] <badabingbox> what no cool line patterns?
[1:21:51] <devanmuse> Does your house now have a lawn?
[1:21:54] <artoflec> fuck racism and fuck lawns too
[1:21:58] <lazerscraper> i wish life had an ost for work
[1:21:58] <+SpiritRoads> I'd mow the lawn too if I had this banger of a theme playing
[1:21:58] <+Vigonept> do ya even have a lawn right. ow?
[1:21:58] <Admiral_PopnFresh> amazing Suda game design
[1:22:00] <trianglehat> is your lawn also just a texture now?
[1:22:02] <+PRocci18> i unironically loved mowing
[1:22:03] <Profmcstevie> Why we even HAVE a lawn dad if all we do is stare at it till it's long and then cut it
[1:22:06] <%NopeBadguy> What about now?
[1:22:08] <%DianaTheAscian> did you ever sell you lawn mowing skills?
[1:22:11] <%Meekest> Go debone the chickens
[1:22:12] <%crazyspartan214> pat clean your room
[1:22:12] <%HolePunchLeaf> Today I learned saying Fuck Racism is woke OMEGALUL
[1:22:12] <%EdenOfLove> @Grimdogx saying Fuck Racism is woke but that's not a bad thing.
[1:22:12] <%okuriskyles> all my homies hate racism and lawns
[1:22:15] <+AngriestAngryArtist> now Gief mows the lawn
[1:22:17] <%cvp5127> that's what rain is for
[1:22:18] <%Daxalog> I wish I got chores
[1:22:19] <DusK_The_Stray> I hated cleaning the car
[1:22:21] <lazerscraper> life with a style meter
[1:22:21] <%Puhff> Wow, so apparently the Bob Ross Twitch chat does NOT like it when you mention the new Netflix documentary
[1:22:25] <SunsetJack> Most annoying chore to do?
[1:22:26] <%Deft_Thought> Outside of a small number of regions in the US, most parts of the country aren't designed for the massive amount of water needed to maintain lawns
[1:22:29] <%coward_man> cleaning the car was a scam for me cause he had a 7 seater and would make me clean the thing for like £5
[1:22:31] <Admiral_PopnFresh> cool shirt
[1:22:32] <brachydios777> I also love the implication of these being that being an assassin doesn’t pay very well for Travis
[1:22:33] <%MashinChaserR> go car the wash
[1:22:33] <rytisone> does your house not have a lawn?
[1:22:34] <%afronooch> dishes
[1:22:34] <%Deft_Thought> They're trash
[1:22:35] <%linSP> Not now dad, I need to mow the lawn in a video game
[1:22:39] <+haitakaa> i hate folding clothes
[1:22:41] <kingra> F U C K R A C I S M
[1:22:42] <%NopeBadguy> Dishes
[1:22:42] <+ThomasOfTroy> Yeah, my family literally never cleaned the car. that just seems stupid tbh
[1:22:43] <%thedankestmeeme> dishes
[1:22:43] <%Puhff> Dishes
[1:22:43] <Zeppelee> @realthiele That it is, but the woke crowd believes that Caucasian don't suffer from racism.

[1:22:58] <Cycrosa> hoover
[1:22:58] <%DianaTheAscian> washing/folding clothes

[1:23:02] <SunsetJack> Loool
[1:23:02] <Dova573> @Puhff Of course not, also fuck the bob corp owners
[1:23:05] <%bevyrage> @Puhff partly because it counts as advertising and that's against the bob ross chat rules
[1:23:06] <%JoshManVGH> Sweeping or vacuuming, personally.
[1:23:07] <%DianaTheAscian> Oh god
[1:23:07] <commanderapathy> I hated mowing the lawn too
[1:23:13] <%RealThiele> LOOOL
[1:23:14] <SunsetJack> Mom being mom
[1:23:15] <Zeif00> I hate that shit
[1:23:16] <SaltyAzteca> Consistent Inconsistencies. A motherly trait.
[1:23:16] <%cvp5127> oh back lawn fancy
[1:23:17] <%JohnAtDawn> I would too
[1:23:22] <lazerscraper> ONLY WHEN IT GETS PUT AWAY

[1:23:23] <+Vigonept> YOU JUST SAID GOD DAMN IT
[1:23:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OH GOD IVE HAD THAT SO MANY TIMES
[1:23:32] <doggieo> classic mom move
[1:23:32] <lazerscraper> II HATE THAT SHIT
[1:23:33] <deadinsideman_> not being from the 1st world, lawns are such a fucking wild concept
[1:23:39] <%sandrews> What is happening with bob ross @Puhff
[1:23:40] <zanzibarian_hamster> You should have just done it anyway to make her happy
[1:23:40] <PassBand> Why would you fall for that more than once? @PatStaresAt
[1:23:41] <%afronooch> YEP. That was my mom with doing the dishes. Always had the "Oh clean the whole kitchen while your in there"
[1:23:41] <%Meekest> How many times did this happen
[1:23:45] <+KaguraRaion> My mom does that shit i hate it
[1:23:47] <Spagheddies> Is your family entirely composed of Mind Goblin people?
[1:23:48] <%FoxEarsOak> telling you to Do The Thing after saying "Don't Do The Thing" is Big Paige Energy
[1:23:48] <viewtifulr> I hate that so many times  even at work
[1:23:48] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Pat that is literally what being in the army is like
[1:23:49] <%gustavozxd> she waited until you dropped your guard
[1:23:53] <%Grimdogx> This is why we should just get rid of grass
[1:23:53] <Argo247> Yeah that sucks.
[1:23:54] <%Puhff> Wow, look at that grass!
[1:23:57] <Zeif00> When somebody calls you to take care of something and then adds other things on top of it when you get there
[1:23:57] <brachydios777> “I altered the agreement, pray I don’t alter it further”
[1:24:00] <%MisterRockett> Seems purposefully cruel.
[1:24:02] <%HolePunchLeaf> lawns are bad for the environment anyway
[1:24:03] <DusK_The_Stray> Happens every time
[1:24:04] <%gustavozxd> "big"
[1:24:05] <OldManDeckardCain> pat, you are never the big man
[1:24:05] <PassBand> Now its YOUR lawn
[1:24:08] <%Agami23> well your a man at least
[1:24:08] <Dr_Mooose> "tomorrow"
[1:24:09] <iacus_> @zanzibarian_hamster nah that shot is abusive
[1:24:09] <Psyramics> its my lawn now, no one is changing the requirements on me mid-job
[1:24:12] <iacus_> shit*
[1:24:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Big (small) man
[1:24:13] <%NopeBadguy> And the next day
[1:24:18] <%thedankestmeeme> Worst chare had to be the dishes if they weren't clean you had to do them again with HER watching like cmon
[1:24:18] <%SWFanatic> News at 11: Orb mows Lawn
[1:24:19] <+Vigonept> do it tomorrow in a year
[1:24:21] <%Puhff> I also hated mowing the lawn cuz my dad would freak out if it wasn't P E R F E C T
[1:24:22] <%thedankestmeeme> chore*
[1:24:25] <+AngriestAngryArtist> or teach gief to do it??
[1:24:26] <+froduck42> well he's half right
[1:24:26] <%DooWopShaBop> IS this a lawn mower game?
[1:24:33] <%CoffeeKaiju> Is this "bad" or "tastefully bad"
[1:24:34] <%DianaTheAscian> I'm glad I grew up with a desert yard
[1:24:35] <%okuriskyles> yes
[1:24:35] <badabingbox> That's why I ripped up my lawn and replaced it with a garden
[1:24:39] <%cooldude69xx> @zanzibarian_hamster Screw that, people should ask for the favor they want
[1:24:45] <%CoffeeKaiju> hahaha
[1:24:45] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Just hire Travis
[1:24:45] <@DakotaMacDoodle> It's the kid version of can you work 2 more hours today.
[1:24:48] <%NCC1701Dave> so good
[1:24:50] <%TheHappyCynic> The most nuts thing about this univers is that being an assassin isn't actually a job. it kinda is in nmh1 but all the jobs are really arbitrary assignment work that's handed out to any assassin employed at the agency. being an assassin is structurally a sport. like being a football or baseball star. despite the fact that Sylvia constantly tells travis it isn't a game, the uaa is structured like a sporting company. it's absolutely bonkers.
[1:24:52] <%RealThiele> i just want a small patch of grass to lay on
[1:24:54] <%gustavozxd> this fucking hoodie LUL
[1:24:55] <%Meekest> Man who liked Death Stranding loves lawn mowing game
[1:24:56] <%JohnAtDawn> It's the progress bar. That makes it feel good.
[1:24:58] <spicyramengaming> Yeah, it is indeed surprisingly fun
[1:24:58] <xeros720> yeah, i liked these side jobs too
[1:24:59] <lazerscraper> FUCK RACISM
[1:25:00] <%sandrews> Why not just cut half the grass one day then the other the next?!
[1:25:01] <%DianaTheAscian> it looks satisfying
[1:25:02] <%MelBrooksKA> That never stopped me from being lazy
[1:25:03] <%Puhff> Lawns are stupid too. Just have moss/native grass
[1:25:08] <%linSP> it fun
[1:25:09] <+Vigonept> there are lawn mower sim gamea
[1:25:11] <%coward_man> mowing the lawn in real life needs a progress bar and cool completion noises
[1:25:13] <%NCC1701Dave> pretend grass is racism. mow that shit down
[1:25:13] <%gustavozxd> we did it, especially me though :)
[1:25:16] <theemotionalacehearts> hey pat gunna warn you rn there a part where travis says the gay f-word (it is cencord)
[1:25:16] <+faisalspeedwagon> This game reminds of saints row
[1:25:18] <+ThomasOfTroy> Once I have a house, Imma just returf the lawn so the grass doesn't grow above what city ordinance allows, problem solved
[1:25:18] <%Corporate_Redeemer> I hope FU addresses that hoodie
[1:25:21] <+tussletoes> @TheHappyCynic yup travis just gets screwed over and is basically a part timer/freelancer
[1:25:25] <Zeppelee> Your parents have ought to pay you if you're doing all that shit for them.
[1:25:28] <%Daxalog> God. Imagine a lawn made of only MOSS
[1:25:29] <%cvp5127> theres a vn section in the thunderdome
[1:25:40] <%Puhff> I always wanted a lawn so I could let it grow super tall so people would know to fuck off
[1:25:41] <+RaveBV> That framerate
[1:25:42] <OldManDeckardCain> tbh, travis seems more like the kinda guy that would wear an n-word hoodie because he didn't know what it means
[1:25:43] <%JohnAtDawn> What are these fucking zone names LUL
[1:25:47] <+PettyFunk> That building really reminds me of Teppelin from TTGL
[1:25:49] <MsYakumo> Come to Brazil, Pat!
[1:25:50] <+tussletoes> you'd HAVE to lose if you fought someone with a FUCK RACISM shirt. what would you do? do you LOVE racism?
[1:25:50] <deadinsideman_> @Zeppelee
[1:25:55] <lyzejag> Come to Brazil pls
[1:26:02] <%gustavozxd> Pat's coming to brazil? PogChamp
[1:26:03] <+Vigonept> shin brazil
[1:26:03] <%gustavozxd> oh
[1:26:04] <%ConLin_Arts_> Pls Come to Brazil
[1:26:08] <%mister___doctor> I wonder how many sets of Strive Woolie is running on his honeymoon right now
[1:26:09] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> NEO BRAZIL IS THE FORBIDDEN PLACE
[1:26:10] <MsYakumo> @PettyFunk Shit, you're right.
[1:26:12] <%TheHappyCynic> @tussletoes facts
[1:26:13] <spicyramengaming> IIRC, Suda intended for the side jobs to be as mundane and boring as possible to make the actual assassin fights even more hype and high-stakes.
[1:26:13] <brachydios777> The bike theme is great
[1:26:17] <nilla_24> dont come to brazil pls
[1:26:18] <lazerscraper> come to brazil
[1:26:18] <deadinsideman_> Vem pro Brasil Patricio
[1:26:22] <DusK_The_Stray> Neo Brazil gets me every time
[1:26:22] <hassanico2> Fun Fact: the Fuck Racism sweater is a real tie-in that costs $200 in real life
[1:26:27] <%DianaTheAscian> do they sell the Fuck Racism hoodie?
[1:26:28] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Pinhead says to go to Brasil, Pat
[1:26:28] <viewtifulr> perfect world that does not include neo brazil
[1:26:29] <Dova573> In neo Brazil big J is a mecha
[1:26:30] <CaptainBright> Gotta go get that mythical Snake Venom to overcome the Horse Dewormer
[1:26:36] <%MelBrooksKA> But what about visiting 2snacks?
[1:26:39] <%gustavozxd> Patricio atpRtsuspectd
[1:26:42] <%stantheman_97> is neo brazil better or worse than current brazil?
[1:26:48] <OldManDeckardCain> 200 bucks? damn, anitiracism is expensive LUL
[1:26:49] <%EdenOfLove> My friend says they intentionally make the loading times longer to make it seem more like a wii game
[1:26:51] <hassanico2> @DianaTheAscian for $200
[1:26:51] <%DianaTheAscian> Yes
[1:26:52] <luftraumm1> patricio encara coisas é meu streamer favorito
[1:26:58] <%TheHappyCynic> it depends on which part of old brazill
[1:26:59] <%Corporate_Redeemer> @hassanico2 OH fuck off, 200 dolleridoos?
[1:27:00] <%gustavozxd> it IS current Brazil
[1:27:00] <+kawachipto> this is a video ass video game
[1:27:03] <+PettyFunk> Unclear, but it is certainly more NEO
[1:27:04] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> yes
[1:27:05] <Mobilebeardunit> im pretty sure any Print Shop in town can run you off a hoodie
[1:27:05] <%SWFanatic> is Neo brazil ass or tits?
[1:27:06] <%DianaTheAscian> @hassanico2 damn it
[1:27:06] <+ThomasOfTroy> Neo Brazil is just current brazil but in the future
[1:27:08] <deadinsideman_> @gustavozxd melhor q Patrick
[1:27:10] <%sandrews> MAn Travis runs like someone who has just figured out how to run.
[1:27:11] <DSD24> I'm gonna say its better cause it has Neo Brazil Gundam
[1:27:13] <Mobilebeardunit> what are they gonna do, copyright fuck racism?
[1:27:14] <+ThomasOfTroy> So it's still not great
[1:27:15] <Dova573> I wish Nuevo Mexico was called Neo Mexico instead
[1:27:17] <xeros720> neo brazil is in califlorida so who can say?
[1:27:19] <+baedogg> Neo Brazil would only lose 5-1 to Germany in the World Cup
[1:27:21] <+tussletoes> such a good name
[1:27:24] <%NCC1701Dave> Me go sleep now. Have fun Ya'll!
[1:27:28] <SaltyAzteca> I love the music here
[1:27:30] <ThePrussianCyclops> Amazing Hair!
[1:27:31] <DoubleRrico> amazing hair indeed
[1:27:39] <Zeppelee> Supercrusher Death Kick!
[1:27:42] <+InuOblivion> be careful theyre jerks
[1:27:42] <marvel877> Death moves kinda trivialize some of the fights.
[1:27:50] <DusK_The_Stray> A Soldier of Slaughter with amazing hair!
[1:27:51] <SaltyAzteca> HE DID NOT CARE FOR THE SCREW FUCKER
[1:27:51] <Spagheddies> Types Of Brazil: Brazil. Neo Brazil. Hi Brazil.
[1:27:51] <masheshardest> how can you fight someone who wears that hoodie?
[1:27:55] <%EdenOfLove> CRANBERRY
[1:27:56] <gtl1220> @patstaresat whats the story of the game?
[1:27:58] <brachydios777> WHAAAAAT?!
[1:28:08] <brachydios777> I love the alien designs
[1:28:08] <brominefromspace> i love that sometimes theres the newtype sound when you perfect dodge
[1:28:10] <+Vigonept> can we just make all countries with new shin instead? shin mexico, shin brazil, shin united states
[1:28:23] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Travis ain't racist, he watches plenty of anime with black characters in them
[1:28:40] <%EdenOfLove> Btw Pat your death moves work way better on literally anyone else but axehole over here
[1:28:46] <DSD24> He also loves Mexian Wrestling
[1:28:47] <OldManDeckardCain> travis literally has a black friend LUL
[1:28:54] <%RealThiele> Story of this game is aliens wanna takeover
[1:28:59] <+KaguraRaion> LUL
[1:28:59] <%RealThiele> thats all
[1:29:01] <mrblitzstream> LUL
[1:29:02] <+PettyFunk> I'm only just now playing through NMH1, and I gotta say these aliumz are way more of an interesting enemy than men in suits
[1:29:25] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Travis: "Hey Shinobu, check out my new hoodie!"
[1:29:26] <hassanico2> @PettyFunk They traded off quantity for quality
[1:29:28] <%Daxalog> Yknow what i just realised? They got rid of the [HIGH / LOW] stance thing from previous games
[1:29:37] <gtl1220> @realthiele thank you
[1:29:37] <iacus_> I don't think Travis is racist, but he'd wear the hoodie ironically
[1:29:37] <%spitelite> this enemy is just using the sparda
[1:29:40] <%TheHappyCynic> the actual combat encounters in this game are the best of the series. not sure if I like the boss fights as much though
[1:29:47] <hassanico2> NMH1 and 2, adn especially TSA, flood you with enemies. This gives you arena fights with 5 competent enemies instead.
[1:29:47] <Tennochief> Fun fact: these aliens were designed by Masnori Ushiki
[1:29:48] <+SpiritRoads> KILL
[1:29:48] <Sapphire_Breeze> KILL
[1:29:50] <SaltyAzteca> BE ONE WITH YA FORCE
[1:29:53] <+the22cstomp> K I L L
[1:29:55] <Waddle_Dude> Great + Great + Taiga Chips is net attack up with no downside
[1:29:57] <spicyramengaming> @daxalog Pretty sure that was only in 1.
[1:29:58] <brachydios777> LUL
[1:29:59] <lazerscraper> ANTI GRAV-
[1:30:00] <hassanico2> Personally I prefer ending this fight with SCREW-
[1:30:03] <+tussletoes> the fuck off power
[1:30:04] <%RealThiele> FORCE KILL
[1:30:05] <Zeppelee> @daxalog I just now noticed that.
[1:30:05] <%EdenOfLove> skill use good
[1:30:05] <%Daxalog> oh
[1:30:06] <+faisalspeedwagon> Steve Harvey's favorite word
[1:30:07] <DusK_The_Stray> K I L L
[1:30:11] <+the22cstomp> no they're good
[1:30:16] <DSD24> No they are good to do
[1:30:17] <brominefromspace> nah you can get SS ranks with using a lot of skills
[1:30:19] <+SpiritRoads> I think the rank is based on time and damage
[1:30:20] <+griffball13> skill use is good
[1:30:27] <marvel877> Nah, you're good.
[1:30:28] <The_Legendairy> chips are fine, you can get SS while using them
[1:30:34] <%Meekest> It is until later
[1:30:35] <brachydios777> Use  skills
[1:30:35] <hassanico2> Chat are you familiar with the Family Feud clip with the host going "YES! KIIIILL"
[1:30:38] <%nobodybutalex> yeah you don't need them to beat the game.
[1:30:39] <+InuOblivion> there only like 5 good chips
[1:30:39] <VHLW> theres a few chips with only positives
[1:30:39] <%EdenOfLove> using skills is the only way to get SS
[1:30:39] <%TheHappyCynic> skill use ups your ranking
[1:30:41] <CaptainBright> Skill Use is encouraged
[1:30:42] <+griffball13> rank is based on how fast you are and how much damage you take usally
[1:30:46] <penitentpendant> Bonus for minmaxers, but not necessary for casual. Which is decent.
[1:30:51] <bigboy3d> Death Chips are more useful on higher difficulties
[1:30:52] <DSD24> I love this song
[1:30:53] <%moonmintparadise> sell the materials to get rid of grinding side jobs
[1:31:01] <spicyramengaming> Using lots of skills and throws, as well as not getting hit are big factors in your rank.
[1:31:01] <jorniev> oh he got the the FUK RACISM hodie NICE!
[1:31:04] <marvel877> There's a chip that helps find collectables in the world.
[1:31:21] <%TheHappyCynic> death chips are helpfully against large groups. also they work on bosses which can be very helpful and funny
[1:31:24] <%WutangchickeN> wutang6FLAVOR wutang6FLAVOR wutang6FLAVOR
[1:31:28] <Spagheddies> Oh god this one
[1:31:32] <%Daxalog> So this is the final No More Heroes yes?
[1:31:36] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt A lot of the objectively best chips require you refight bosses at Spicy and above difficulties
[1:31:45] <hassanico2> @Daxalog supposedly
[1:31:46] <Zeppelee> It's a shame that you can't switch sabers in 3.
[1:31:46] <%RealThiele> kill the homeless
[1:31:48] <SaltyAzteca> GOTTA GO RELATIVELY QUICKLY
[1:31:52] <Chester_goes_Berserk> death slow + death rain = absurd damage
[1:31:54] <zanzibarian_hamster> Does travis only get the one sword this game?
[1:32:00] <%logoth_> K I L L

[1:35:06] <brachydios777> I kinda want transformers stinger music to play also
[1:35:15] <spicyramengaming> I like that the combat in this game is very easy to learn but has a lot of cool stuff you can chain together, it's extremely satisfying.
[1:35:20] <Zeppelee> Where's Elmo?
[1:35:22] <%Monkeyweed21> whens Neo Brazil
[1:35:38] <jorniev> did you collect the kitties?

[1:35:50] <%RealThiele> space fight
[1:35:51] <%Monkeyweed21> favorite enemy type so far?
[1:36:02] <+tussletoes> enemy variety seems really good in this game
[1:36:28] <marvel877> The bitrate really hates this game, huh?
[1:36:30] <metabot64> wow this ui is so busy sometimes
[1:36:36] <brominefromspace> @tussletoes it is, and certain combinations of enemies can be brutal
[1:36:41] <%Monkeyweed21> @tussletoes yea that was like the 2nd biggest problem with 1 and 2
[1:36:53] <+tussletoes> good to hear
[1:36:59] <jorniev> man his move set got really upgraded in this game
[1:37:03] <%Deft_Thought> LUL
[1:37:06] <%shootbang_exe> bitrate buster
[1:37:08] <+SmartAssPawn089> Particle effect going crazier than KH
[1:37:09] <DoubleRrico> flawless
[1:37:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> kill?
[1:37:12] <ThePrussianCyclops> cant see shit
[1:37:16] <ShinBojangles> the bitrate adds to the experience :)
[1:37:18] <brachydios777> good enough
[1:37:20] <jorniev> he even has a million stab
[1:37:20] <%NopeBadguy> 🅱️
[1:37:23] <%Deft_Thought> Slow field and Death Shower are a serious combo
[1:37:34] <+tussletoes> suda "can't see shit" 51
[1:37:35] <spicyramengaming> The Leopardon enemy is probably my favorite though.
[1:37:37] <%HolePunchLeaf> Twitch is too much of a normie to handle NMH3
[1:37:40] <%Deft_Thought> I wonder of NMH3 is gonna get ported in a year?
[1:37:51] <xeros720> i'm a big fan of the Fullfaces
[1:37:53] <%gustavozxd> yeah I love it
[1:37:56] <+the22cstomp> it fits travis though
[1:37:57] <%Treasure_Vault> Did you ever beat Scarlet Nexus?
[1:37:58] <+tussletoes> it's perfect he looks like such a dork
[1:37:59] <lyzejag> OMG
[1:38:00] <ShinBojangles> Travis running like he needs to shit
[1:38:01] <%coward_man> he looks like he's about to shit his pants
[1:38:01] <jorniev> HE IS RUNNING LIKE AN OLD MAN WOULD
[1:38:17] <Baljhet> yo I just read the text on the hoodie.
[1:38:19] <zanzibarian_hamster> Running like he HAS shit his pants
[1:38:19] <brachydios777> I would kill for ports of this
[1:38:20] <%NopeBadguy> Isn't Travis like mid-40s
[1:38:21] <lyzejag> He's going to shit his pants, maybe cum and piss
[1:38:24] <daniphofani> @Deft_Thought I feel like it wouldn't be the same without the jank
[1:38:33] <Airuzen> @NopeBadguy early 40s
[1:38:33] <Zeppelee> Well, Travis IS 39 years old.
[1:38:35] <SaltyAzteca> FAST KILL

[1:38:50] <%NopeBadguy> wtf just happened
[1:38:50] <+tussletoes> i think travis almost busted a nut the first time sylvia got close to him so
[1:38:50] <%RealThiele> fast kill
[1:38:51] <brominefromspace> regretting not going spicy pat?
[1:38:53] <deadinsideman_> only s
[1:38:53] <Spagheddies> Goes to show how much Death Skills trivialize fights.
[1:38:54] <DusK_The_Stray> Death Rain and Death Slow are really strong together
[1:38:54] <jorniev> damn
[1:38:55] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought The PC port is still pretty janky
[1:38:57] <hassanico2> Huh
[1:38:57] <brachydios777> S
[1:39:06] <+Sildbill> spicy hurts
[1:39:09] <hassanico2> Did you crank up your damage to maximum or something? LUL
[1:39:10] <ShinBojangles> D:
[1:39:11] <DSD24> Dood this game can get hard on Bitter
[1:39:12] <%NopeBadguy> Yes
[1:39:13] <marvel877> The skills trivializes fights, yo.
[1:39:16] <+griffball13> i love the terimator reference when he teleports back
[1:39:18] <disflipmat> I beat it on Spicy and believe me it would not have been fun to watch a Spicy playthrough
[1:39:18] <%HolePunchLeaf> @Deft_Thought it's not on PC
[1:39:19] <DSD24> Black Hole killed me a bunch
[1:39:24] <+InuOblivion> spicy is quite spicy
[1:39:31] <hassanico2> Nah Bitter's totally find, the experience just kinda changes depending on how you spend your WESN
[1:39:35] <hassanico2> fine*
[1:39:35] <DusK_The_Stray> Spicy is pretty fun, but yeah, lol
[1:39:38] <iacus_> jesus that pop-in
[1:39:38] <FreddyLeeSavage> should i wait for pc version or play this now
[1:39:38] <RangerJ95> Music Expert Pat, what do you think of the music?

[1:39:43] <%chosenjuan42> what's Pat's chip build?
[1:39:49] <jorniev> I miss holy summers
[1:39:52] <+tussletoes> do we actually know the PC version is coming?
[1:39:53] <spicyramengaming> @marvel877 Nah, only if you use them as a crutch and not a mechanic in combination with your other combat abilities.
[1:39:57] <%NopeBadguy> Any more big project plans after this and ME3?
[1:40:00] <%False_Being> Ramen shop goes hard af

[1:40:56] <DusK_The_Stray> Honestly the Full Faces are my favorite regular enemy
[1:41:04] <+the22cstomp> i love that the newtype flash sfx plays when travis dodges
[1:41:08] <brachydios777> Quick question chat. Does Travis play Meltyblood?

[1:42:26] <jorniev> i love how travis just terminator teleports
[1:42:27] <DusK_The_Stray> @brominefromspace It's noticeable but I had like Lv 7 Attack at around this point. Later on it's less noticeable.
[1:42:27] <marvel877> Travis funded the creation of Dong Dong
[1:42:29] <CaptainBright> Travis feels more like he'd play that goddamned Umineko fighter over Arcana Hearts
[1:42:34] <%Monkeyweed21> SCORPIION
[1:42:34] <rytisone> scorpion
[1:42:35] <%cvp5127> scorpion
[1:42:36] <+the22cstomp> scorpo pat
[1:42:39] <+InuOblivion> its still crazy that this is the same world as Killer7
[1:42:39] <%MashinChaserR> what about the scorpion
[1:42:43] <%Meekest> Too late
[1:42:43] <+tussletoes> if they're anything like TSA they're gonna be great
[1:42:48] <lazerscraper> SCORP
[1:42:59] <%RealThiele> psaLiz
[1:43:00] <+the22cstomp> missed a scorp in the cul de sac
[1:43:03] <%chosenjuan42> you can fast travel in the map menu
[1:43:06] <spicyramengaming> @tussletoes They are okay, nowhere near as good as TSA tho
[1:43:06] <%logoth_> Travis made Dong Dong
[1:43:07] <brachydios777> Blind
[1:43:17] <%logoth_> Scorpions give shit money
[1:43:17] <%okuriskyles> :(
[1:43:18] <%NopeBadguy> Would you say to buy this game on the Switch or wait for a PC port?
[1:43:23] <+tussletoes> @spicyramengaming ahhh really? shame
[1:43:24] <DusK_The_Stray> But the Mind Goblins
[1:43:27] <+the22cstomp> just making sure, in case you were gonna mind goblin it
[1:43:28] <%Meekest> This is why you need glasses
[1:43:34] <%logoth_> 500 coins
[1:43:36] <+griffball13> why not just fasttravel?
[1:43:37] <brachydios777> Travis would love Dong Dong
[1:43:37] <%RealThiele> but number tho
[1:43:43] <%chosenjuan42> Press minus to fast travel
[1:43:46] <brominefromspace> it runs fine on switch, just wait for pc if you want mods i guess
[1:43:47] <DusK_The_Stray> Yeah
[1:43:47] <+the22cstomp> yep
[1:43:47] <+ravendxx> its on the map
[1:43:49] <+griffball13> go to map and hit y
[1:43:50] <Cdjgamer> Y on map
[1:43:50] <%logoth_> press y on the map screen
[1:43:50] <Vertigheist> if you get glasses you can be eggman
[1:43:51] <The_Legendairy> on the map screen
[1:43:52] <%Agami23> yeah go to map and click Y
[1:43:52] <spicyramengaming> @tussletoes Its to be expected, as TSA was VERY story focused.
[1:43:56] <solidustouchdown> there was someone on the parking lot
[1:43:58] <deadinsideman_> there is
[1:43:59] <Zeppelee> Just ask Paige if you can borrow hers.
[1:43:59] <%Piemono> GLASSES
[1:44:00] <SunsetJack> Yes
[1:44:02] <xeros720> really
[1:44:03] <%RealThiele> LUL
[1:44:05] <+KaguraRaion> Its literally on the map.....
[1:44:06] <deadinsideman_> in the mapscreen
[1:44:06] <%MelBrooksKA> There's slow travel too
[1:44:10] <CaptainBright> unless your collectables give you new abilities like the Lovikov balls in NMH1, don't bother
[1:44:12] <marvel877> If you had glasses, you'd know there's fast travel, Pat.
[1:44:15] <%Daxalog> is Paige still playing FF14 later?
[1:44:17] <jorniev> that reallly felt like it crashed
[1:44:17] <%Piemono> Y
[1:44:19] <penitentpendant> Insight Gained
[1:44:21] <+KaguraRaion> it literally says it on themap lol
[1:44:25] <%Monkeyweed21> pat prefers medium travel
[1:44:25] <hassanico2> There's actually one super lucrative sidequest collectible that gives good money with little effort.
[1:44:32] <%NopeBadguy> Paige is playing 14?
[1:44:32] <%RealThiele> amazing
[1:44:33] <hassanico2> But I dunno where to trigger it. It involves trees.
[1:44:34] <%NopeBadguy> How far is she?
[1:44:34] <%coward_man> yet
[1:44:34] <marvel877> GLASSES
[1:44:37] <%mister___doctor> Every time I hear this music I start taking my pants off

[1:44:39] <DusK_The_Stray> Not yet
[1:44:41] <%DianaTheAscian> very excited for that
[1:44:41] <gespenst_mr_ghost> yet
[1:44:44] <penitentpendant> I wish her luck in whatever role she choses
[1:44:44] <%Shikari21> LUL

[1:44:53] <+Vigonept> oh no
[1:44:55] <brachydios777> oh
[1:45:01] <xeros720> oh boy, character creation shenanigans
[1:45:06] <cherrycottontail> that doesn't mean she hasn't broken her butthole tho
[1:45:08] <jorniev> i hope she plays a tank
[1:45:08] <%Daxalog> Shes gonna be a dps for sure.
[1:45:20] <Zeppelee> Oh, she will when she gets to Shadow ringers.
[1:45:21] <+NYCrownlessKing> can't wait for her to clear Ucob before pat
[1:45:22] <%Agami23> i didnt get this
[1:45:25] <tanarath> She finally has a doctor's appointment for glasses, though.
[1:45:27] <penitentpendant> There's good arguments for her to either be Tank or DPS
[1:45:36] <%cooldude69xx> @Daxalog Is DPS big and strong?
[1:45:40] <%kyh9> HEEEY
[1:45:44] <spicyramengaming> This song is a bop
[1:45:47] <%Mendin> Tiberium???
[1:45:49] <%kyh9> I loved this shit from Travis Strikes Again
[1:45:54] <%Monkeyweed21> thats technically how crystals appear
[1:46:07] <%NopeBadguy> NO MORE MINECRAFT
[1:46:24] <Vertigheist> time to diggy diggy hole
[1:46:25] <jorniev> i wonder what random easter egg of this game is gonna end up being the main plot of suda51 next game
[1:46:30] <Zeif00> Paige gonna be playing femroe? I kind of assumed w/ that pic on Twitter
[1:46:31] <cherrycottontail> she's probably gonna choose marauder first because big and strong,. and then hate tanking the first dungeon, and stop playing limesOwo
[1:46:34] <Mobilebeardunit> How long til Paige sees the eye doctor? And how many doors can she break in the meantime?
[1:46:35] <%SWFanatic> dig up
[1:46:37] <+grimywaifu_> TSA has the best story of all 4. I love the text adventure stuff.
[1:46:48] <+Vigonept> alright pat play minecraft

[1:47:09] <tanarath> DRK/New death night class is probably best
[1:47:09] <+NYCrownlessKing> ^
[1:47:14] <spicyramengaming> TSA has some absolute bangers in its soundtrack too
[1:47:15] <Zeppelee> Eh, I'm a Dragoon/Red Mage.
[1:47:16] <%MelBrooksKA> Did they say your eyes were shit?
[1:47:23] <%Monkeyweed21> Can the Eye doctor solve Paige's need to break or lose her glasses?
[1:47:26] <%kyh9> Minecraft!
[1:47:30] <%logoth_> Perfectly calibrated eyes

[1:48:25] <+FrenchTact1cs> one lazy eyes worse than both
[1:48:30] <zanzibarian_hamster> Pat is actually blind it's why he yells to echolocate the video games
[1:48:36] <+Vigonept> in the middle of the street
[1:48:43] <%NopeBadguy> You're gonna dig up the Millenium Tower in that empty lot
[1:48:46] <hassanico2> The payoff to this VN is... worth it (?)

[2:06:03] <DusK_The_Stray> Yep! @MisterRockett
[2:06:08] <Zeppelee> Keep your promise, Travis.
[2:06:14] <DevinMayCry> Its her song to Travis. All she wants is for senpai to notice her
[2:06:15] <%Monkeyweed21> awesome twitch is broken for Pat specifically on my end
[2:06:19] <%RealThiele> shes glitter now
[2:06:19] <DusK_The_Stray> Yeah Earth is too strong for the aliens
[2:06:20] <+InuOblivion> This time Kimmys outta high school
[2:06:24] <Mahbonk> This fight feels similar to the magician assassin from the first game
[2:06:24] <%DianaTheAscian> This song is super good
[2:06:25] <+FrenchTact1cs> woolie doesn't need this damage
[2:06:26] <penitentpendant> No More Bitrate
[2:06:26] <%cvp5127> she grew up and became bayonetta

[2:07:28] <%JoshManVGH> A laser fight show
[2:07:33] <marvel877> 20 20 vision, huh.
[2:07:33] <%DianaTheAscian> oh no its that monster from rise's attack
[2:07:36] <%Mendin> Who was the laser DJ assassin from NMH2
[2:07:41] <$hewlettfan96> this whole game is kill la kill shite
[2:07:46] <hassanico2> Nathan Copeland
[2:07:52] <hassanico2> Yeah this has Nathan's arena trap gimmick
[2:07:53] <%MisterRockett> Is this ranked? Did she start working with the aliens? Or is this a defense title for Travis again?
[2:07:59] <%hereiam407> Boom
[2:08:03] <SaltyAzteca> THINK KIMMY THINK
[2:08:05] <+the22cstomp> nope
[2:08:10] <Baljhet> I mean, she killed our target, which replaces him in the ranks.
[2:08:11] <penitentpendant> @MisterRockett She killstole the alien
[2:08:13] <DevinMayCry> @MisterRockett She killed the ranked alien. This is all personal now
[2:08:13] <hassanico2> She's got nothing to do with aliens. Just wrong place and wrong time.
[2:08:14] <daniphofani> Fun fact: Kimmy's design for this game was done by Bayonetta character designer Mari Shimazaki
[2:08:15] <%RealThiele> its ranked now she merced vanishing point in like 2 seconds
[2:08:16] <+itsgundamu> She's got some cool attacks its too bad they are easy to dodge
[2:08:17] <%hereiam407> She killed Vanishing point, so I guess she was technically 7th
[2:08:18] <%EdenOfLove> @MisterRockett I think she basically just crashed the party Mr Vanishing Point was throwing
[2:08:28] <Cdjgamer> she is from 2 and she wants revenge
[2:08:32] <DevinMayCry> She poached him just to get the rematch
[2:08:37] <deadinsideman_> @MisterRockett this is just a sidequest, the ranked alien already died
[2:08:54] <hassanico2> Super armor
[2:08:55] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> the whole rap was about how much she wants this revenge fight lol
[2:08:58] <%hereiam407> Oooh yeh
[2:08:58] <hassanico2> CAMERA FUCKERY
[2:08:58] <+Yamchadassist> did ya know that hell is sweet?
[2:09:00] <Cdjgamer> she is now 7th she killed vanishing point
[2:09:00] <SaltyAzteca> OH SHIT CAMERA
[2:09:01] <Spagheddies> IT IS TIME FOR THE GIMMICK
[2:09:02] <Zeikier> oh damn
[2:09:03] <+TopTieramisu> some yoko taro shit
[2:09:04] <%hereiam407> You're on TV
[2:09:06] <OldManDeckardCain> yeah, this part is not so great
[2:09:06] <DSD24> This is some Drakengard shit
[2:09:06] <Zeikier> camera shift!
[2:09:08] <+InuOblivion> camera snatch
[2:09:09] <+AnthonyJMax> you on tv
[2:09:09] <lazerscraper> FIXED CAMERA
[2:09:13] <+Vigonept> its resident evio pat
[2:09:14] <%hereiam407> DMC anyone?
[2:09:17] <+AnthonyJMax> smile fore the camera
[2:09:18] <+pectusumbra> okay but for real if they do this bit a 3rd time it would be kind of lame
[2:09:18] <DevinMayCry> Theres a stadium of people watching this
[2:09:19] <MsYakumo> And now we have a drone cam.
[2:09:22] <Mahbonk> beats the upside down camera from 1
[2:09:22] <rytisone> it's like that one fight in DMC
[2:09:26] <+pectusumbra> 3rd time in a row
[2:09:28] <%EdenOfLove> i like how she's barely moving
[2:09:29] <SaltyAzteca> FINISH IT IN STYLE
[2:09:30] <hassanico2> Oh god the audio on this TV
[2:09:31] <DevinMayCry> Look at all the people
[2:09:32] <Chester_goes_Berserk> fun fact: you can destroy the drone cam
[2:09:33] <hassanico2> It's hilarious
[2:09:35] <%hereiam407> except cooler
[2:09:38] <Blank9> el shaddai does something like this too
[2:09:41] <%mister___doctor> This is like if Taylor Swift and Steve-O had a death match live on stage
[2:09:41] <daniphofani> I guess the UAA dropped the rule that you can't fight somebody who kills a ranked member for you like Henry did, since this is twice now Travis gets cucked in this game
[2:09:42] <%linSP> I guess vanishing point was the unfinished boss so they brought back an old foe?
[2:09:46] <%RealThiele> kill the camerman material
[2:09:47] <Cdjgamer> tank camra

[2:12:48] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> and another one loll
[2:12:48] <SilverFaustX> atpDance
[2:12:48] <%hereiam407> He'll just power bomb her out of the rankings
[2:12:48] <%bread_assassin> Travis is a proponent of true gender equality.
[2:12:49] <+the22cstomp> yeah but she's an ALIEN pat
[2:12:49] <charrchord> he can't talk to women, he can only rap badly at them
[2:12:51] <Vertigheist> yesss
[2:12:51] <lazerscraper> LITERALLY NEXT RANK
[2:12:51] <%Treasure_Vault> That could mean anything
[2:12:51] <%Ziegsy> Travis, the anit-paige
[2:12:52] <DevinMayCry> Travis is just feeling conflicted
[2:12:53] <olwe123> does he have a switch controller on his left hand?
[2:12:53] <%DianaTheAscian> BUT AN ALIEN GIRL
[2:12:53] <DusK_The_Stray> She doesn't count
[2:12:55] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Sylvia aged amazingly well
[2:12:56] <%JoshManVGH> Maybe somone will take her out too
[2:12:56] <Blank9> travis that's your wife
[2:12:57] <MsYakumo> Wait... is Travis a sad dad?
[2:12:58] <%Deft_Thought> @PatStaresAt Aliens don't count!
[2:12:58] <%rbakervv> @kyh9 and he didn't kill three of them
[2:12:59] <Vertigheist> I love her theme
[2:13:00] <%MidnightBurst12> they're aliens, it's different
[2:13:01] <+Vigonept> nah but she's an alien
[2:13:01] <%hereiam407> He'll figure it out
[2:13:02] <SocialMisfitGamer> THE LAST TIME HE KILLS A WOMEN
[2:13:03] <%nobodybutalex> I love velvet chair girl!
[2:13:03] <OldManDeckardCain> well, we will see about that...
[2:13:04] <Zeikier> guess Travis needs to brew some of that Respect Women juice soon
[2:13:04] <%toastybites> YEYEYEYE
[2:13:05] <SilverFaustX> the end
[2:13:05] <%EdenOfLove> ALIENS GIRLS DONT COUNT
[2:13:05] <%arizenarkana> There's definitely some beneath the surface shit going on here.
[2:13:06] <%MisterRockett> I think there's a high possibility Shinobu or Bat Girl will be taking care of the girls on the list.
[2:13:07] <Admiral_PopnFresh> ANIME
[2:13:07] <hassanico2> shut up, anime outro time
[2:13:09] <dragon17013> UNO
[2:13:09] <LunarRemix> Yeah that scene doesn't make much sense. Feels like Suda just forgot a lot of Travis's fights
[2:13:09] <Mahbonk> SourPls
[2:13:10] <neraren> Aliens cant be girls silly
[2:13:10] <SaltyAzteca> yeyeyeye Pat Dance
[2:13:11] <%MisterRockett> Bad Girl
[2:13:13] <Cdjgamer> aliens dont count
[2:13:13] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Granted, Jeane had her hand in his chest about to rip out his heart
[2:13:13] <$Jaxnos> rip in pieces kimmy
[2:13:13] <%RealThiele> alien women ok to kill
[2:13:15] <Zeppelee> Time for MUSICAL CHAIRS.
[2:13:16] <jorniev> WAS THAT BAT DAD?
[2:13:16] <$hewlettfan96> Travis is a anti-Chad
[2:13:17] <DevinMayCry> @olwe123 Deathdrive controllers. Totally not the same lol
[2:13:20] <deadinsideman_> FUCK YEEEEEAAAAAH
[2:13:22] <%cooldude69xx> It feels like everyone is just saying dialogue that sounds cool on paper, even if it doesnt work
[2:13:23] <TehMud> Hold up.. Sylvia went cross-eyed for a minute there. ***
[2:13:25] <%kyh9> NIGHT IN PRAGUE
[2:13:25] <Zeikier> I mean he said last time, not first time :V
[2:13:25] <jorniev> BAD MAN I MEAN
[2:13:31] <%mister___doctor> Good episode
[2:13:31] <deadinsideman_> fuckin love this songs
[2:13:32] <%rbakervv> @LunarRemix he's fought girls, but only killed a couple of them
[2:13:36] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> pat do a edited version of this outro for your outro
[2:13:37] <+TopTieramisu> SourPls
[2:13:39] <jorniev> THIS SONG IS LIKE GOOD
[2:13:40] <%hereiam407> It's. a nice breather
[2:13:46] <%MugenSandan> God which anime ending is this specifically I know I've seen one like this
[2:13:48] <%SWFanatic> psaGib
[2:13:48] <Admiral_PopnFresh> This is some Tomino shit
[2:13:50] <Zeikier> that's Suda 51's brand :V
[2:13:51] <%kyh9> How you liking the game, Pat?
[2:13:53] <%MisterRockett> @LunarRemix Travis has always been weird about fighting girls. He doesn't like it but does anyway. It's totally believable that he doesn't want to do it anymore.
[2:13:55] <%hereiam407> Have you played no more heroes
[2:13:56] <DevinMayCry> Cooldude69xx is a name thats true to that philosophy too
[2:13:56] <+the22cstomp> @cooldude69xx yeah cause everyone is a nerd
[2:13:58] <DusK_The_Stray> So Ethan in RE8
[2:14:00] <OldManDeckardCain> that IS pat's life LUL
[2:14:00] <cherrycottontail> velvet chair girl is clearly going to get murdered by 4 destroymans, who you then fight
[2:14:02] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Travis never killed Holly Summers. She blew her own head off with a grenade
[2:14:03] <Vertigheist> that's like everything tbf
[2:14:04] <TehMud> I mean that's Travis's entire character
[2:14:05] <rytisone> I know that feeling way too well
[2:14:07] <%RealThiele> most anime
[2:14:08] <masheshardest> but if you are confident enough its actually cool
[2:14:10] <$hewlettfan96> That song was the most amazingly cringe-cool thing ive seen from a game like this
[2:14:12] <%Ziegsy> I wanna watch outlaw star againnow
[2:14:12] <%kyh9> @cooldude69xx Welcome to No More Heroes
[2:14:14] <Zeikier> is this still maintaining that strong 4/10 pat? pchGOODBOYGETIT
[2:14:17] <SaltyAzteca> Im just here hopin to see Killer7 cameos
[2:14:22] <+Vigonept> would ethan and travis say shitty jokes to each other
[2:14:23] <%hereiam407> Huh
[2:14:24] <MsYakumo> @rbakervv Yeah. And it seems like every time Travis actually kills a girl he takes it super hard.
[2:14:25] <hassanico2> COW MANURE WOOO
[2:14:26] <DoubleRrico> this game is so unapologetically itself
[2:14:27] <+the22cstomp> @MugenSandan Zambot 3
[2:14:28] <%SWFanatic> ok
[2:14:34] <%kyh9> @cooldude69xx It's worth remembering that Travis is inconsistent in his philosophy from one scene to the next in NMH1
[2:14:35] <%JoshManVGH> You ever try to come up with a oneliner in real life? Shits hard. Half of Spider-Mans vamping is talking about how hard oneliners are
[2:14:36] <SilverFaustX> atpToiler
[2:14:36] <%hereiam407> Jus beat Killer 7 yesterday, very weird game
[2:14:37] <+twohitgood> the future runs on bullshit!!
[2:14:40] <%rbakervv> @MsYakumo exactly

[2:14:45] <%Monkeyweed21> @Corporate_Redeemer didnt Bad Girl run into her own grinder
[2:14:46] <jorniev> pretty much
[2:14:46] <%kyh9> Literal Kamen Rider from the future
[2:14:48] <%hereiam407> It's Suda's mind set free
[2:14:49] <$hewlettfan96> It is itself
[2:14:49] <DevinMayCry> @SaltyAzteca And if there isnt maybe they;ll patch it in post launch like TSA did
[2:14:50] <Blank9> killer7 rules
[2:14:56] <%Agami23> this game wants its style to be casually cringe

[2:15:38] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Jammies
[2:15:38] <%SinnerEbru> bc it being fun is the difference between RER and narcissism
[2:15:39] <DevinMayCry> Fu is not woke but accept nail appointments is important enough to blow off his royal order

[2:18:38] <+the22cstomp> it gut punches you with racism
[2:18:40] <%Puhff> bitterShook

[2:18:52] <%rbakervv> @StarMechV yep
[2:18:53] <jorniev> i cant belive how racist is and how  i dont know if its on purpose
[2:18:53] <solidustouchdown> Jeane is Knack, look it up
[2:18:54] <%Daxalog> Didnt they make a statement about that?
[2:18:54] <Tennochief> but fuck the roaches though

[2:18:57] <Mobilebeardunit> More than attack on titan?
[2:18:58] <%Treasure_Vault> Like that one panel of Wolf Guy?
[2:19:00] <%RealThiele> Japan knows how to racism
[2:19:02] <CaptainBright> I still remember people memeing the shit out of the anime with BASKETBALLS
[2:19:02] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> And then the buff blonde haired dude named Adolf?
[2:19:02] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> its so unabashed racist that is actually amazing
[2:19:02] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Fuck Racism jacket lol
[2:19:03] <Tennochief> every cockroach must die

[2:19:04] <%afronooch> AlienPls
[2:19:08] <%MisterRockett> Racism how? Cause I'm looking at this cockroach man and it's uuuuuuh not great.
[2:19:13] <Sapphire_Breeze> @ThePrussianCyclops YEYEYE
[2:19:15] <%MashinChaserR> @jorniev apparently it wasn't but good lord
[2:19:19] <Vertigheist> they don't have lips tho LUL
[2:19:29] <DevinMayCry> Its probably. Only half on purpose. Cause its based off like, cheddar man
[2:19:31] <%Agami23> they put in a character named adolf who is an expert at killing the bug men, so i feel like its on purpose
[2:19:32] <+Yamchadassist> when i saw the bugs driving a fucking convertible smoking a blunt i just couldnt
[2:19:37] <DomunDomunDomun> Not on purpose, they're based on homo erectus. Still looks fucking OOF though.
[2:19:37] <$hewlettfan96> why does travis look like he doesn't want anyone to know he shat his pants
[2:19:38] <alroy900> oh....... yeah ok I rememeber those coackroach deisgns
[2:19:39] <%hereiam407> Chippy
[2:19:42] <%cooldude69xx> OH THATS TERRAFORMARS
[2:19:45] <%Monkeyweed21> WHY DO THEY LOOK LIKE THAT
[2:19:47] <Nilon240> augh God why does terraformars look like that???
[2:19:49] <%hereiam407> Wtf
[2:19:51] <Sunstalker> Some of it's on purpose, some of it's not. It's an option select
[2:19:51] <Sapphire_Breeze> @Vertigheist there is one later in a white suit that almost looks like a rapper LUL
[2:19:56] <zhenthrim213> @Agami23 fuck i forgot
[2:20:00] <Zeppelee> Japan is ridiculously xenophobic and racist.
[2:20:04] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> thanks for bringing up terraformers travis
[2:20:05] <%cooldude69xx> WOW
[2:20:11] <DSD24> @Sunstalker Option select the racism?
[2:20:15] <MikeStrider> The manga is real good but i fear it won't really continue much further cause of the author's health still
[2:20:18] <%toastybites> Theres also an unironic super alpha male character with blonde hair and blue eyes named Adolf
[2:20:19] <%Agami23> why do they get the gold chains and hold the guns side ways? why do they have to do that terraformars
[2:20:21] <Admiral_PopnFresh> 5% wow
[2:20:21] <%MugenSandan> Isn't one of the characters in Terra Formars basically Hitler revived?
[2:20:24] <%EdenOfLove> Great Great Taiga
[2:20:24] <+Yamchadassist> i remember reading the reddit posts of people goin "na it aint racist tho"
[2:20:24] <$Jaxnos> they said two Greats and a Taiga
[2:20:25] <%hereiam407> I want to puke after looking at that
[2:20:28] <+spikyxhero> This isn't the only time they mention terraformars by the way.
[2:20:32] <%Agami23> they're stronger than guns
[2:20:40] <%hereiam407> @PatStaresAt Are you talking to Shinobu in the lab after/before each battle?
[2:20:43] <DevinMayCry> @toastybites That one is much more clear influence of sus to me
[2:20:49] <muXPerience> pretending that they can do whatever just because they're on an island
[2:20:53] <neraren> That means if you hit someone 20 times its like you hit them 21 times! Wooooow!
[2:20:54] <%Deft_Thought> @PatStaresAt I'm gonna run to my local bike shop to get my new (bought used) bike looked at. Trying to get some new parts. Have a great rest of the stream, man.
[2:20:57] <CaptainBright> speak with badgirl, pat
[2:20:57] <zhenthrim213> @spikyxhero good
[2:21:00] <%RealThiele> pat cannot unlink the ginger chip, it is who he is
[2:21:02] <%Deft_Thought> Take care chat. Have a good night.
[2:21:03] <TehMud> Have you been talking to Bad Girl?
[2:21:06] <cherrycottontail> it's very much intentional. He could have done like 10 things to make it not look like that, including not putting fucking Jheri curls on them
[2:21:11] <hassanico2> boooo I wanna see Travis but an unhealthy weirdo who recommends Tomino animes to grieving women though!
[2:21:12] <%EdenOfLove> @PatStaresAt the bad girl one's really good
[2:21:13] <TehMud> Bad Girl's upstairs
[2:21:15] <The_Legendairy> Shinobu and bad girl have different things after every rank
[2:21:16] <$hewlettfan96> holy shite they are intentionally racist all right
[2:21:18] <CaptainBright> Pat, talk to Bad Girl
[2:21:19] <DusK_The_Stray> They're almost different for both Bad Girl and Shinobu
[2:21:24] <%cooldude69xx> @cherrycottontail its about early man tho
[2:21:25] <+r_squared1672> looking at terraformars, they just kinda look like alien bug men to me?
[2:21:28] <DusK_The_Stray> *almost always
[2:21:29] <lazerscraper> Talk to the GIRLS
[2:21:37] <DevinMayCry> I cant believe THE GAME is talking about terra formars
[2:21:41] <hassanico2> Travis telling Bad Girl to go watch Ideon is fucking hilarious
[2:21:41] <supergoblinpunch> Holy shit they have afros
[2:21:42] <zhenthrim213> me either
[2:21:45] <+RandyFistburgers> I'd never heard of it. Google cleared things up real quick
[2:21:45] <Zeikier> not where you expected today to go lol
[2:21:45] <+itsgundamu> I gotta go see it now
[2:21:46] <TehMud> I still have no idea what Terra Forma is I'm off to google
[2:21:49] <hassanico2> Also "Today is Char's Counterattack Day"
[2:21:50] <%RealThiele> fast travel is for suckers
[2:21:52] <@Ranryu692> that was naive
[2:21:52] <$Jaxnos> what a whiff, holy shit travis
[2:21:55] <SocialMisfitGamer> Is that Jotaro?
[2:21:57] <Tennochief> @r_squared1672 they're mutated cockroaches sent to mars
[2:21:59] <lazerscraper> it has a WHIFF animation for the scorpions
[2:22:00] <$hewlettfan96> Japan isnt racist, only to Chinese and koreans sadly
[2:22:02] <+Vigonept> just give up
[2:22:02] <jorniev> JOTARO?
[2:22:03] <%Monkeyweed21> HELP PREVENT GLOBAL WARMING
[2:22:03] <%EdenOfLove> pat please don't ignore Travis's anime recommendations
[2:22:04] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt This sidequest is excellent for quick money!
[2:22:04] <lazerscraper> beautiful
[2:22:04] <%Daxalog> One of the panels has them shooting guns. ONe of the cockroaches is holding it sideways
[2:22:06] <neraren> Serve till you urinate blood?
[2:22:08] <zhenthrim213> @TehMud save yourself
[2:22:09] <SaltyAzteca> Just plant all the trees
[2:22:10] <%HolePunchLeaf> missed OMEGALUL
[2:22:12] <xeros720> oh god, i look up terraformars
[2:22:14] <xeros720> it's so bad
[2:22:15] <CaptainBright> Somebody please remind Pat to talk to the girls later when he gets back to the motel
[2:22:18] <xeros720> first god damn panel
[2:22:23] <muXPerience> yeah trees are gonna save us from the entire industrial world
[2:22:31] <SuperChumps> I'm currently eating a 15g of protien chocolate chip cookie that just tastes of ass.
[2:22:35] <%okuriskyles> :)
[2:22:39] <SocialMisfitGamer> RAINBOW SCORPION
[2:22:41] <StarMechV> Everyone loves Zangief
[2:22:41] <$hewlettfan96> oh god those cockroach people looking like a 40's looney tunes cartoon
[2:22:43] <+RandyFistburgers> Biding his time until he eats them
[2:22:45] <Tennochief> I love Terraformars, especially the animals it uses
[2:22:45] <hassanico2> Anytime you come back to a grown tree, you'll get a good amount of money if you climb it.
[2:22:46] <UberKingKai> Theres a choice few panels
[2:22:50] <%okuriskyles> zangief loves the children
[2:22:55] <Zeppelee> Yay, GIEF!
[2:22:56] <%cooldude69xx> He knows he's too powerful for others
[2:23:00] <Tennochief> Esepcially the Pistol Shrimp boxer
[2:23:01] <Dr_Mooose> what a sweet boi
[2:23:02] <%RealThiele> dont let the kids cover gief with covid
[2:23:04] <hassanico2> The tree needs to grow first
[2:23:11] <%hereiam407> @PatStaresAt Recommend speaking to them (Shinobu & Bad girl) for extra dialogue at the motel, after each rank.
[2:23:13] <Tennochief> and the bullet ant brawler girl
[2:23:14] <%Puhff> he knows you can take it
[2:23:17] <+Vigonept> the kids love the zangief
[2:23:22] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt The trees are super noticeable, they have the same glowy rainbow coloring as that scorpion when grown
[2:23:27] <SilverFaustX> nice popin
[2:23:28] <Tennochief> and the russian crab man with the best regeneration powers
[2:23:37] <mrblitzstream> so Gief will Psycho-Crusher you guys... got it xD
[2:23:59] <+TheBitingIrish> Has Pat seen the SF5 Google AI thing?
[2:24:07] <%hereiam407> Ass blasting power
[2:24:08] <hassanico2> Sleeping In probably made you tired
[2:24:10] <zhenthrim213> IN THE ASS?
[2:24:11] <SaltyAzteca> In her ass?
[2:24:12] <Zeppelee> Hi Paige.
[2:24:12] <MayShip> it was a good suggestion tho
[2:24:15] <xeros720> try a red bull
[2:24:16] <%MisterRockett> Still reading up on Terra formars. Apparently it's wildly popular in Japan, which actually makes Travis and Bishop being uncomfortable about it incredibly interesting.
[2:24:22] <%Mendin> wake me up (wake me up inside) can't wake up)
[2:24:24] <%jinking79> 99 trees to go
[2:24:24] <$Jaxnos> i notice the requirements for each ranked battle has gotten cheaper (if small blue gem means it's a minor instance compared to the large red ones)
[2:24:28] <%SaiyanShoto> Does Paige know about Terraformars?
[2:24:31] <%Puhff> Shoot the cocaine into your arm then, jeez picky!
[2:24:36] <Zeif00> hay Paige
[2:24:37] <DevinMayCry> @MisterRockett The live action movie?
[2:24:47] <hassanico2> Why is FullFace such an awesome enemy
[2:24:49] <+pectusumbra> reminder yeah they are talking about the live action
[2:24:50] <DevinMayCry> Cause they are talking about the Miike movie specifically
[2:24:56] <StarMechV> @MisterRockett Bishop and Travis are suppose to be Americans so it kinda makes sense they'd find it iffy
[2:24:57] <%hereiam407> Can we get a live action NMH movie?
[2:24:58] <theemotionalacehearts> do you have the charge attack?
[2:25:00] <%Puhff> Didnt realize Paige was too good for butt cocaine
[2:25:00] <+pectusumbra> And paige, looking forward to the FF14 thing tonight!
[2:25:02] <+NYCrownlessKing> they don't like the movie. they don't care about the show
[2:25:03] <$hewlettfan96> why does he shout popular fruits whilst attacking?
[2:25:11] <DevinMayCry> Yakuza got a movie
[2:25:17] <%IamGrapes> Good Afternoon early @PatStaresAt  and Paige
[2:25:17] <%MisterRockett> @DevinMayCry You know what that's fair they could just be talking about the live action movie being bad.
[2:25:23] <%Puhff> ...why'd she say "friend" so weird?
[2:25:23] <+NYCrownlessKing> his anime waifus are based off fruits
[2:25:25] <SaltyAzteca> Moeeeee
[2:25:26] <DevinMayCry> ITS FROM HIS LITTLE GIRL ANIME
[2:25:28] <+the22cstomp> they're the names of magical girls from an anime
[2:25:28] <Zeppelee> Have fun with FF14, Paige.
[2:25:33] <charrchord> Moe~
[2:25:35] <Cycrosa> MOE
[2:25:38] <CaptainBright> He really, really likes his Bizarre Jelly anime waifus
[2:25:38] <zk_nails> Oops all berry!
[2:25:41] <+NYCrownlessKing> there attacks are like strawberry BEAMMM
[2:25:41] <%hereiam407> Isn't he yelling what they feel when they attack in the anime?
[2:25:43] <%MisterRockett> @MisterRockett Yeah but they're still being written by Japanese writers so it would require some introspection on their part.
[2:25:44] <DSD24> Sailor Mars was the best one
[2:25:45] <Dr_Mooose> oh the coffee girl
[2:25:45] <%hereiam407> yell*
[2:25:46] <%Monkeyweed21> its supposed to be like Pretty Cure or something
[2:25:46] <%senfood> He names his attacks after his anime waifus.
[2:25:49] <lazerscraper> Moe~
[2:25:54] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Does Paige is the gay?
[2:25:57] <%mister___doctor> RED RANGER

[2:26:03] <%ConLin_Arts_> Pat, let Paige have the sidepiece
[2:26:03] <%EdenOfLove> Pat please don't forget to talk to bad girl before the ranking fight
[2:26:03] <StarMechV> YOU DON'T KNOW THAT PAT
[2:26:04] <SaltyAzteca> the 5 ft of wiener
[2:26:05] <%The_Protagonist> psaJpeg
[2:26:05] <SteelCNT> I love how all these vtubers are watching that one clip of paige in plauges pokemon vid
[2:26:06] <Zeppelee> Pure White Glastonbury
[2:26:07] <$hewlettfan96> tongue her
[2:26:08] <%SaiyanShoto> Is that code for her drug dealer?
[2:26:08] <%hereiam407> This man just running around in here without a care in the world
[2:26:09] <%Deft_Thought> Okay, bye
[2:26:09] <ohno778> I thought the "friend" was a drug dealer or something.
[2:26:09] <%Ghufufin> little does Pat know...
[2:26:11] <Profmcstevie> You think
[2:26:11] <+FoolsArcade> You don't know that she don't have a big weiner!
[2:26:13] <DevinMayCry> In old games he would say the full fruit pastry for attacks but its shortened to just the fruits now lol
[2:26:13] <%hereiam407> Coffee & donuts
[2:26:14] <RiderSensei> she ~likes~ her
[2:26:14] <zk_nails> you don't know that
[2:26:16] <%Puhff> you dont know that
[2:26:16] <theemotionalacehearts> do you have the charge attack?
[2:26:17] <+Vigonept> marriage in danger
[2:26:20] <olwe123> that you know
[2:26:25] <%MisterRockett> @Monkeyweed21 There are WAY too many panty shots for it to be Pretty Cure. I mean I haven't WATCHED Pretty Cure but I assumed it was for children.
[2:26:25] <Zeif00> Kappa
[2:26:27] <DevinMayCry> CRANBERRY CHOCOLATE SUNDAE is now just him yelling SUNDAE
[2:26:29] <%Kyma1020> mmmm hot coffee

[2:26:30] <$hewlettfan96> is Paige is the straight??
[2:26:31] <SocialMisfitGamer> And there was also Ikaruga style game based on those that you play in NMH1
[2:26:32] <DevinMayCry> Er CRANBERRY I mean
[2:26:33] <lyzejag> Is she .... You know

[2:26:42] <%ConLin_Arts_> Bigger peperonies
[2:26:44] <xeros720> yeah, it'd get in the way of the coffee machines
[2:26:48] <$hewlettfan96> ITS A TRAP
[2:26:50] <%Puhff> Wow, wife asks if other lady is pretty. That's a trap if I've ever heard one
[2:26:50] <%hereiam407> Penis talk + fruit talk = Cock sundae
[2:26:50] <$Jaxnos> does it sound like trap music when you run, Pat?
[2:26:51] <StarMechV> She drop his monster condom for the magnum dong
[2:26:53] <%MugenSandan> Pat I'm afraid... that everyone is taller than you
[2:26:55] <StarMechV> her*
[2:26:55] <rytisone> Pat is a tripod
[2:26:55] <%MisterRockett> @hewlettfan96 She's in a straight relationship but she's incredibly bad at it.
[2:26:56] <+Gamblor69> Does she watch your streams?
[2:27:02] <%SinnerEbru> if she does have a weiner chances are VERY GOOD shes into girls, so i mean
[2:27:16] <%Monkeyweed21> @MisterRockett Oh I never realized Glastonberry was that kind of anime
[2:27:17] <%SinnerEbru> source: im a trans
[2:27:23] <Profmcstevie> Cut to a week later as Paige tells the story of the coffee girl who dropped her monster condom on the floor
[2:27:31] <%Meekest> What
[2:27:31] <gespenst_mr_ghost> FEED!
[2:27:32] <DevinMayCry> Wh-what?
[2:27:33] <%Agami23> oh god
[2:27:40] <%Corporate_Redeemer> What if you hit your head and wake up gay?
[2:27:44] <%Puhff> FEET
[2:27:46] <homestylewaffles> sever all feet
[2:27:46] <%Agami23> @gespenst_mr_ghost no, FEET
[2:27:50] <Zeikier> pchBlush
[2:27:51] <%unhuggable1> feet
[2:27:51] <DevinMayCry> Why did you envision this nightmare
[2:27:52] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Ohhhh....
[2:27:53] <StarMechV> what a nightmare timeline
[2:27:53] <%ConLin_Arts_> Clemps?
[2:27:56] <zhenthrim213> you mean shes not
[2:27:56] <+TokenNoir> What it do
[2:27:58] <Ardailec> FEET
[2:28:00] <%SWFanatic> Who is the president? "Paige!"
[2:28:01] <StarMechV> TARANTINO SYNDROM XD
[2:28:01] <+TopTieramisu> armpits!
[2:28:02] <%MisterRockett> @Monkeyweed21 You get to see an animation of the intro in 1 and it's like, every two seconds their full ass is on the screen it's built to make you uncomfortable.
[2:28:03] <%EdenOfLove> Would vore be better
[2:28:05] <Zeppelee> What.
[2:28:06] <devanmuse> Phineas Paige
[2:28:07] <%hereiam407> Want to try a fetish? Hit your head
[2:28:08] <%Treasure_Vault> Reroll for armpits
[2:28:09] <%stantheman_97> scat?
[2:28:09] <Dova573> WAIT THATS A THING?
[2:28:10] <ohno778> Then it switches to scat
[2:28:10] <Baljhet> no, offense to the foot people
[2:28:13] <neraren> "What if Paige hit her head" is an alarmingly plausible scenario
[2:28:13] <gespenst_mr_ghost> That is significatly worse
[2:28:14] <Zeikier> tarantino's foot fetish bits in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood kinda tasteless
[2:28:15] <Profmcstevie> We bonk till she returns to normal
[2:28:15] <@Spydurman> replace it with something weirder, like a skeleton fetish Kappa
[2:28:15] <@Ranryu692> Paige would rather be into armpits than feet confirmed
[2:28:16] <Dr_Mooose> hey, could be worse
[2:28:16] <%unhuggable1> feet makes no fucin sense
[2:28:17] <+Mrbaconator> many offense to the feet
[2:28:19] <Zeif00> feet get out
[2:28:21] <lazerscraper> All offense to the foot people
[2:28:22] <ThePrussianCyclops> THERE WORSE THING OUT THERE
[2:28:24] <lazerscraper> All of it
[2:28:24] <DevinMayCry> A story in which a person is bitten by a foot fetishist and gets a lust for feet
[2:28:26] <$hewlettfan96> ahh feet
[2:28:27] <%Corporate_Redeemer> To be fair, aren't feet fetishists have their brains wired weird?
[2:28:28] <%DianaTheAscian> Paige you can go much worse than feet...

[2:33:47] <$hewlettfan96> @xeros720 Paige has a shit problem she mentioned it many times
[2:33:48] <%hereiam407> Shut up
[2:33:48] <Lilgamba> As Pat discusses  sphincters, Travis navigates the sphincter  of the Earth
[2:33:50] <DSD24> Are we talking about X Pac
[2:33:53] <%Puhff> Unrelated factoid: the butthole is 4 degrees warmer than the front butt

[2:34:57] <egressanon> it's a very physically demanding career
[2:35:00] <%Ipsenscastle> Paige knows all the butthole tricks
[2:35:01] <%RealThiele> getting poop inside your non-colon body parts is very dangerous

[2:46:25] <SocialMisfitGamer> "what the fuck does Zangief mean?" I imagine that would be what they would say, if they found out his real name

[2:47:50] <DevinMayCry> "Oh like Wreck it Ralph!"
[2:47:51] <BigFingerRo> @Agami23 Ah, that's ok, I thought maybe you wanted something in the meantime you got a more resistant one or smth
[2:47:54] <lyzejag> I CLAPPED
[2:47:56] <brachydios777> YE
[2:48:01] <Dml84> i would act that way tbh
[2:48:05] <+Mrbaconator> like in fortnite
[2:48:07] <$Jaxnos> i... i didn't realize this was literally D-Day until you walked over
[2:48:07] <daniphofani> I like how the beaches still have Holly Summers' military equipment all over it
[2:48:16] <Baljhet> Yeah, that's weird.
[2:48:20] <+superchronicc> how are the ports for 1 and 2 on pc?
[2:48:22] <DSD24> Except for that bad NMH2 stage in the mall
[2:48:26] <DevinMayCry> @Jaxnos The zones called "Call of Battle" lol
[2:48:28] <LunarRemix> Probably due to performance issues
[2:48:30] <Zeppelee> Same.
[2:48:31] <%RealThiele> the framerate dimension tho
[2:48:40] <%Agami23> @BigFingerRo yeah i just made a type, looking for more durable stuff because my boy tore apart all his toys super fast.
[2:48:42] <zhenthrim213> just shout travis
[2:48:43] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> yeah no levels
[2:48:45] <%ConLin_Arts_> how was it, has Gief achieved his maximum mass or will he get bigger?
[2:48:48] <%Agami23> typo
[2:48:53] <$Jaxnos> @Jaxnos oh shit lol i wasn't paying attention to the zone name, fair
[2:48:58] <brachydios777> I love these move names
[2:49:02] <Baljhet> also fewer assets if you're just having an open world and arenas
[2:49:05] <%afronooch> i wanna live in the framrate dimension
[2:49:05] <ThePrussianCyclops> Who even park their higgins there
[2:49:06] <%hereiam407> The lack of levels is the worst part, but I forgot by the end of the game
[2:49:06] <%MashinChaserR> is it also the bitrate dimension?
[2:49:16] <%SWFanatic> psaGiefrail
[2:49:22] <masheshardest> the alternative is DP2
[2:49:24] <DSD24> The game is the bitrate black hole
[2:49:28] <%maenos2> which boss is pat up to now
[2:49:31] <%hereiam407> Compress this colors
[2:49:32] <Profmcstevie> It's gotten to the point games built for Switch really do have to compromise their design for this piece of shit
[2:49:34] <Zeppelee> Cranberry juice is delicious, and good for digestion.
[2:49:47] <BigFingerRo> @Agami23 How big is he? I have a big dumb lab and he's had the same rope with rubber balls on each end for a while
[2:49:48] <DSD24> @maenos2 I think next is Velvet Chair girl
[2:49:56] <DevinMayCry> Trust your force
[2:49:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> tbh most games are kinda bitrate annihilating on twitch
[2:49:58] <%maenos2> @dsd24 sweet
[2:49:58] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> I hope this game gets dlcs like TSA NMH

[2:51:29] <DevinMayCry> Which is neat

[3:01:12] <jorniev> yeah but people can also not give a shit back
[3:01:14] <%Agami23> if it was a fan they would give the food and say "compliments of the chef"
[3:01:14] <doggieo> Totally would not have tipped
[3:01:22] <bear_breaker20> I remember in 8th grade going to montreal and crazy half naked assholes would scream at my class
[3:01:23] <BlooBirdo> D:

[3:02:26] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> atomic43Hoggers
[3:02:28] <%coward_man> man if someone said that to me in a restuarant there would be an "excuse me" leaving my mouth
[3:02:34] <moonmintparadise> I bet the guy tought that was the most funny thing ever because he assumed that Pat would not be able to fight him lmao
[3:02:41] <%ConLin_Arts_> Gief craves violence
[3:02:46] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> LUL
[3:02:50] <%SWFanatic> psaWrong
[3:02:52] <studleydoorite> she can't stop him Zangief is bigger than her
[3:02:57] <Spagheddies> TBH if someone drops that shit on me, I just get up and leave.
[3:02:58] <ThePrussianCyclops> fuck that guy in particular
[3:03:04] <%EdenOfLove> pat could probably have kicked his ass
[3:03:16] <dukenux> Pat enters a restaraunt. Cue a waiter: OH LOOK AT THIS CHONKER. IN AWE OF SIZE OF THIS LAD
[3:03:23] <Zeppelee> Gief please.
[3:03:25] <BarnYardFiddler> @coward_man Followed by a, “You feelin froggy? “ 🐸 lol
[3:03:28] <Profmcstevie> Pat has a low centre of gravity he coulda fought him
[3:03:41] <%sporeian94> pat
[3:03:47] <%sporeian94> pat's secret fetish revealed
[3:03:50] <%Treasure_Vault> I mean that's fair
[3:03:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> wait Pat doesn't wear diapers?
[3:03:54] <%Mathochism> I see thisnmist be the avant-garde section of NMH3.
[3:03:55] <Dr_Mooose> is that how it works?
[3:03:57] <zubasterd> here we vod
[3:04:00] <+Mrbaconator> that absolutely counts
[3:04:00] <%cooldude69xx> It definitely counts
[3:04:01] <M0untain_wolf> 1
[3:04:02] <%Birdigalore> But then you'll still have shit smeared on your ass
[3:04:04] <%Treasure_Vault> I wouldn't want to wear a diaper, but i really don't wanna shit myself constantly
[3:04:04] <zubasterd> *go
[3:04:06] <%Qsmash_> DOES IT?
[3:04:08] <%Monkeyweed21> it still counts
[3:04:09] <notsoy> god i hope this gets clipped
[3:04:09] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> A diaper a day keeps the doctor away.
[3:04:10] <studleydoorite> diapers are made to be shit in
[3:04:11] <BrvldrHungryHeart> it totally counts tho
[3:04:11] <jorniev> HE IS NOT TECHNICALLY SHITING HIS PANTS
[3:04:12] <maybefalco> yeah you you still have a squished log in your diaper
[3:04:14] <%stantheman_97> i would say it makes it worse
[3:04:15] <doggieo> IT COUNTS
[3:04:16] <%cooldude69xx> You can totally shit your diaper
[3:04:17] <SaltyAzteca> but what about the smell
[3:04:18] <SharkTankAgito> It doesn't
[3:04:18] <%logoth_> lol
[3:04:19] <masheshardest> if you do it on purpose you have power
[3:04:19] <%Ipsenscastle> is wearing a diaper every day better than shitting your pants one single time?
[3:04:22] <%Ziegsy> Babies shit themselves
[3:04:22] <BarnYardFiddler> I get IBS from some weird IPA beers
[3:04:24] <%MashinChaserR> It's not about not shitting your pants it's avoid shit going everywhere
[3:04:25] <%Ziegsy> it counts
[3:04:27] <Profmcstevie> JUST SAID IT
[3:04:27] <bear_breaker20> admitting to situational diaper wearing increases the RNG that pat will eventually shit himself
[3:04:30] <DoubleRrico> it's not the gross, it's the tedium of the cleanup?
[3:04:31] <%Daxalog> Does Diaper embarassment Stack?
[3:04:33] <%linSP> just stick a tube up in there that is connected to the toilet duh
[3:04:34] <KasiCrafter> It doesn't hit the PANTS, but it DOES mean you still shit YOURSELF
[3:04:35] <Fenlig> Just wizard away all the poop like normal people
[3:04:36] <Zeppelee> I wish I had a marriage like theirs...
[3:04:36] <%SWFanatic> clip it
[3:04:37] <disflipmat> A diaper is just shit pants that you can throw away
[3:04:40] <%EdenOfLove> holy shit this conversation is interesting but look at Pat's combo
[3:04:43] <maybefalco> DO IT
[3:04:44] <+BBQPaintchips> LUL
[3:04:44] <zubasterd> it does in fact count
[3:04:44] <%Axellogic> DO IT NOW
[3:04:44] <%cooldude69xx> *SHITS AGGRESSVELY* "Didn't count"
[3:04:45] <%NitronStreams> Its not shitting your pants if shit doesnt hit the pants
[3:04:45] <SharkTankAgito> It counts
[3:04:45] <studleydoorite> the man's got shit in his diaper, just let him have this one Paige
[3:04:46] <Profmcstevie> Babies poop their diaper they don't shit themselves
[3:04:47] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU STILL SHIT YOURSELF
[3:04:47] <DSD24> Take a shit
[3:04:47] <Hydrapissed> hes GANA POOP

[3:04:59] <%linSP> take a shit NOW
[3:05:02] <%sporeian94> Yes that is shitting yourself by definition
[3:05:04] <KasiCrafter> In a minute......
[3:05:10] <%coward_man> nah Pat the moment I need an adult diaper is when I eat the gun
[3:05:12] <%TubeMan642> Big stake for a big diaper baby!
[3:05:15] <reonome> babies shit themselves all the time
[3:05:16] <+LightLifter> I just came to the stream and they are already talking about their scat fetishes

[3:05:22] <BarnYardFiddler> Wouldn’t you get mad chaff butt walking around shit like that
[3:05:22] <jorniev> i still cant belive thats the voice they gave jeanne
[3:05:30] <%Mendin> Diapers are meant to be shat in, whereas shitting your pants implies unintentionality
[3:05:36] <Hydrapissed> LOL
[3:05:37] <DevinMayCry> If you wear pants over your diaper and shit yourself thats still shitting your pants
[3:05:38] <%ConLin_Arts_> does Gief have some doggy friends?
[3:05:40] <+haitakaa> any poop that comes out accidentally when you're not on the toilet
[3:05:41] <@Spydurman> IM ON IT
[3:05:42] <Profmcstevie> Add the context of "Pats crazy poll me"
[3:05:42] <+ravik75> its not different, if it smells the same
[3:05:43] <%Daxalog> Can you roll the spikey ball off?
[3:05:43] <+TopTieramisu> fake gamer mod
[3:05:45] <%Monkeyweed21> this is gonna be WEIRD without context
[3:05:49] <%DashXero> Diapers exist for shitting. However, shitting in a diaper still constitutes shitting yourself.

[3:07:50] <shotgang86> The stream ends, Pat and Page stares foward, but not to each other. A long sigh followed by a giggle. No one in that room wants to speak a word.
[3:07:50] <%NitronStreams> according to the poll the mere act of WEARING the diaper = shitting your pant
[3:07:52] <%linSP> it’s confirmed real
[3:07:57] <%Daxalog> is the girl...you?
[3:07:59] <BarnYardFiddler> Let me guess mad shit dick
[3:08:07] <%strakillias> You just don't get the same amount of shame when you shit yourself wearing a diaper.
[3:08:14] <@Spydurman> I take full blame for the poorly worded poll. I rushed it but eh fuck it, you were all here

[3:15:07] <$hewlettfan96> ehhh
[3:15:07] <%Mendin> Stay humbus
[3:15:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> The moral of the story is: Eat your own shit in a desperate attempt to save face

[3:38:58] <zhenthrim213> dumbasses yes
[3:39:00] <%senfood> Sigma Male Grindset is the best meme of the year so far.
[3:39:01] <blastazoid00> Sigma grindset
[3:39:01] <+allups> LUL
[3:39:02] <%MashinChaserR> what does mgtow even mean
[3:39:03] <xeros720> i think everyone knows sigma is so  dumb and made up that it's almost always a gag
[3:39:04] <%NopeBadguy> People who believe in that shit aren't people
[3:39:05] <viewtifulr> SIGMA from megman X?! He's back again!
[3:39:05] <$hewlettfan96> SANTA ligma
[3:39:06] <%Ipsenscastle> I have no idea what Sigma is, and I'm happy for it to stay that way
[3:39:06] <vastboss333> Sigma is a joke to shit on "alpha" people
[3:39:08] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Let's say, hypothetically, Santa was based
[3:39:08] <%RD_NX> scrimblo > sigma > alpha
[3:39:09] <DevinMayCry> Sigma literally started as a way for the alphas to be like "nuh uh im actually more alpha by being less alpha"
[3:39:13] <%unhuggable1> Sigma is sarcastic
[3:39:13] <$hewlettfan96> What is ligma
[3:39:16] <beard__0> Filthy redditors
[3:39:16] <Zeppelee> Lambda FTW
[3:39:19] <Madinki> There's only ONE sigma and it
[3:39:21] <Teyaric> The idea is alpha conqours their nearby group, and Sigma is able to stand alone? It's literally UberMench concept, actual nazi shit.
[3:39:24] <+froduck42> Hyeanes are matriarchal
[3:39:24] <%sporeian94> wolf packs are actually a mom, dad and the cubs for the most part
[3:39:24] <ThePrussianCyclops> Wolf are family
[3:39:25] <%DianaTheAscian> y they want to be a overused mega man x villain?
[3:39:28] <+grimywaifu_> Raise the child from birth with the Sigma Grindset
[3:39:30] <%Monkeyweed21> wolves are familial
[3:39:34] <Profmcstevie> It'd be better to look at cats
[3:39:34] <dukenux> Wolves hunt in packs for a reason
[3:39:38] <%Ghufufin> @PatStaresAt  the researcher later went to on to point how false the study was
[3:39:40] <@Spydurman> wolves are basically family packs
[3:39:40] <%stantheman_97> they don't have a designated leader
[3:39:41] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Casual reminder that Big Boss believed in Santa until he was fucking 40
[3:39:46] <conchthechimera> The researcher tried vehemently to rectify the research he put out Pat, like, he hates that this stupid idea came about from his incorrect book
[3:39:47] <SkinnyRite> Wtf did I just walk in on
[3:39:48] <OldManDeckardCain> PATHETIC BETA MALE
[3:39:48] <Madinki> There's only ONE sigma and it's Keanu Reeves
[3:39:48] <%RealThiele> wolves that wanna kill themselves create a society that makes one less suicidal wolf in charge
[3:39:49] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Is sigma actually a real thing? I thought it was a 4chan troll type thing.
[3:39:51] <%Ipsenscastle> the final evolution
[3:39:51] <%linSP> “Packs” are just families
[3:39:52] <+healnavi> Omega is a Greek latter
[3:39:53] <+tigerfang86> Omega is the giant robot who kills people in Final Fantasy 5
[3:39:53] <%srv4254> no thats vergil
[3:39:55] <studleydoorite> the final wolf, the wolf to end all wolfs
[3:39:55] <%SinnerEbru> paige thats fanfiction
[3:39:55] <%DedlokPM> "2nd place is first loser!"
[3:39:56] <brachydios777> Imagine calling yourself Sigma unironically
[3:39:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> Omega is the last letter of the alphabet
[3:39:56] <+the22cstomp> paige are you the high
[3:39:57] <%BubbaRands> so Dom is a wolf?
[3:39:58] <Teyaric> Most distant from alpha, is the concept - Furthest removed from the group.
[3:39:59] <+bad_luck_luke> smegma males
[3:40:00] <%YakumoYomi> Omega is the robot from Sonic Heroes
[3:40:00] <%Ynkubus_> Its more the researcher later came out and said they were wrong but barely anyone listened
[3:40:00] <%toastybites> its not religion lol
[3:40:00] <%DianaTheAscian> Omega is a boss in Mega Man Zero 3
[3:40:02] <dukenux> Omega is cool, because Dante is Omega
[3:40:02] <%Birdigalore> I'm a Pi Male
[3:40:02] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Omega male is the ultimate cuck
[3:40:02] <%Treasure_Vault> zeta males
[3:40:03] <xeros720> oh, paige it's greek lettering, Alpha is A and Omega is Z pretty much
[3:40:06] <%baka_sugoi> PAIGE NOT NERD
[3:40:06] <+grimywaifu_> Scrimblo Male
[3:40:06] <OldManDeckardCain> SURE
[3:40:07] <Spagheddies> Sigma > Alpha > Beta > Omega, apparently.
[3:40:07] <%RealThiele> BIG weed
[3:40:07] <%SWFanatic> paige is the alpha and the omega
[3:40:07] <olwe123> So wolves live in a Society
[3:40:07] <%Jeemukun> for that matter Humans are primates not canines, why would our social structures have anything in common with a wolf's
[3:40:08] <BarnYardFiddler> Number is 2 is always lame lol
[3:40:08] <%NitronStreams> VERGIL THE ALPHA AND OMEGA
[3:40:08] <+healnavi> PAIGE
[3:40:10] <%SinnerEbru> youre thinking omegaverse, or a/b/o
[3:40:12] <%Arek_1> Omegas are just ace. LUL

[3:40:12] <%senfood> Daily reminder that Superman still believes in Santa.
[3:40:13] <BlooBirdo> Pi male
[3:40:13] <%Agami23> omega DOES mean "the end" to some things. like the alpha and omega
[3:40:15] <disflipmat> wow that was too much of a delay
[3:40:16] <%RD_NX> I'm a delta male psaDab
[3:40:17] <%Corporate_Redeemer> EPSILON MALES RISE UP
[3:40:17] <SaltyAzteca> @DianaTheAscian YEAH HE IS
[3:40:18] <KonekoSilvertail> Paige are you thinking of omegaverse
[3:40:19] <Chester_goes_Berserk> omega is supposed to be the lowest ranking one, but yeah the science went wrong
[3:40:23] <i_chevalier> Christmas was allowed to exist,  because Christians could stop people from partying on winter solstice.
[3:40:26] <dukenux> VERGIL, THE CHAD AND THE VIRGIN
[3:40:27] <AoiRob> paige you're thinking of fanfiction
[3:40:30] <BarnYardFiddler> Omega is the beginning and end so probably omega the best
[3:40:32] <TheFramedWarlock> Omega is the last letter in the Greek alphabet
[3:40:33] <BarnYardFiddler> God is omega
[3:40:35] <Zeppelee> What of Epsilon?

[3:43:05] <i_chevalier> @patstaresat  Did anyone see the video of a teacher reading a fanfic in the classroom, and all her students seeing it project on the whiteboard for every one to see
[3:43:08] <%Ixiah> i would pay if someone recreated Sopranos with Mafia game models
[3:43:10] <AMajorTom> I think I saw the same dumb documentary Paige did. The alpha eats first and breeds. Then the betas who helped hunt eat. Then females. Then the omegas who are mostly shunned and live outside the pack feed. It was a whole thing.
[3:43:10] <notsoy> do you know how sick it would be to rip off your entire top with one motion like Kiryu

[3:50:53] <%Ipsenscastle> frankly the horse paste idiots should be the ones at the back of the line if it's self inflicted
[3:50:53] <%Puhff> Elmo is fake????
[3:50:54] <%EdenOfLove> @peachSaliva it's not super real what is real is that covid victims are filling up hospitals so gunshot people get screwed

[3:51:15] <themrslimeguy> @PatStaresAt Just think B is A and X is Y easy
[3:51:15] <$hewlettfan96> the switch is great
[3:51:18] <%코코꾸라> Nintendo's buttons came first

[3:51:24] <Profmcstevie> Nintendo made them first, blame Xbox
[3:51:25] <@QueequegTheater> To be fair didn't the SNES controller have them this way
[3:51:26] <DevinMayCry> The horse goo freaks defense is they make some for humans too but like, we dont give a shit about that, people are eating the horse goo and feeding their kids it on toast

[4:04:45] <%Dakuu75> Paige is right
[4:04:46] <%shootbang_exe> counts
[4:04:46] <ThePrussianCyclops> why the bed
[4:04:47] <+allups> it does
[4:04:48] <Zudrag> not yett
[4:04:48] <%Ipsenscastle> this truly has been the pants-shittingest stream
[4:04:50] <+trackles_64> sharting
[4:04:51] <+grimywaifu_> theres no pants to be shat
[4:04:52] <%cvp5127> shit in your purse
[4:04:52] <DevinMayCry> Shorts counts for shitting your pants too
[4:04:52] <%SWFanatic> shes right
[4:04:53] <OldManDeckardCain> this is a really shitty debate
[4:04:53] <%afronooch> the pants are a multiplier yeah
[4:04:53] <%Piemono> It's basically like pooping in a toilet
[4:04:53] <Zeikier> yeah, Rich Evans pulled his pants down in Don't Shit Your Pants
[4:04:57] <%Agami23> every time you shit, you shit yourself if you really think about it
[4:04:58] <%Puhff> nah, shitting yourself naked isn't as bed cuz you can just jump in the shower
[4:05:00] <%RealThiele> still counts
[4:05:02] <%Ipsenscastle> ergo she will shit herself
[4:05:05] <Blank9> it doesn't count, check the win conditions of don't shit your pants the game
[4:05:08] <%MidnightBurst12> yes
[4:05:09] <dukenux> Yes
[4:05:09] <Zeikier> immediately drop trou
[4:05:10] <%Dakuu75> Just like a homeless person, yes
[4:05:10] <TioXyco> what is this conversation I got back in?
[4:05:11] <%Puhff> YES
[4:05:11] <DusK_The_Stray> Like, you can shit ON the bed and not on yourself.
[4:05:13] <Profmcstevie> RIP EM OFF
[4:05:13] <%SWFanatic> what
[4:05:13] <loukemia83> If you were pajama pants to bed, and shit yourself while sleeping, do you shit your pants or the bed or both?
[4:05:14] <+allups> yes
[4:05:15] <ThePrussianCyclops> yeah
[4:05:17] <%RealThiele> Transitive shit property
[4:05:17] <xeros720> that'll cause more problems if you want to do that
[4:05:18] <masheshardest> then its just pooping outside
[4:05:18] <%DianaTheAscian> isn't that a crime?
[4:05:19] <DusK_The_Stray> Basically yeah
[4:05:19] <ThePrussianCyclops> DO IT
[4:05:20] <@Ranryu692> would you take your shirt off in that scenario @PatStaresAt
[4:05:21] <%hereiam407> Pat's hiding his five year old from the previous marriage in the basement
[4:05:23] <%DianaTheAscian> yes
[4:05:24] <%BubbaRands> trop drou
[4:05:25] <%senfood> Makes perfect sense.
[4:05:26] <%Puhff> Preferably on a rich persons car or something
[4:05:26] <Profmcstevie> But his honour is intact
[4:05:27] <Guilgameshx> LOOPHOLES!
[4:05:28] <xeros720> you'd also be in prison
[4:05:31] <dukenux> shit on the ground, people do it all the time
[4:05:35] <xeros720> so y'know, you make your choice
[4:05:35] <@Ranryu692> like would you do the full disrobe, or just pull your pants down?
[4:05:36] <%Ipsenscastle> wear stripper pants at all times so you can whip them off while shitting yourself
[4:05:38] <%cvp5127> @PatStaresAt is it ok to shit in your purse if its an emergency
[4:05:38] <%baka_sugoi> psaUp
[4:05:40] <%shurtal> which one of you is the Always Sunny Frank in this scenario?
[4:05:40] <TioXyco> it's only a crime if pat gets caught
[4:05:41] <maybefalco> commit crimes to avoid shitting yourself
[4:05:41] <%Puhff> Crimes are only illegal if you get caught
[4:05:41] <DusK_The_Stray> It's less embarrassing than shitting yourself
[4:05:42] <%SWFanatic> Pat pooping outside is illegal
[4:05:43] <Zerotoad5> Trousers have to be full off not on ankles
[4:05:43] <+allups> why is that a crime
[4:05:43] <%RealThiele> if he shits on the ground it counts
[4:05:44] <%Dakuu75> We are WRITING the fine-print, as we speak
[4:05:45] <+TheMilkiestShake> What if it gets on your leg
[4:05:46] <vicar_anat> but if even one molecule of that shit touches your pant, then its game over
[4:05:46] <$hewlettfan96> Ewwww
[4:05:51] <%Arek_1> @PatStaresAt But as soon as your shit-ass puts pants back on, you lose.
[4:05:52] <@QueequegTheater> Why
[4:05:55] <%Wallabri> YESSSSS
[4:05:56] <AMajorTom> So we're back to the same question. Are diapers pants?
[4:05:58] <%RealThiele> very rested from that shit

[4:06:23] <Zeikier> how much will Paige stream vs offline play?
[4:06:31] <%Monkeyweed21> @AMajorTom they're a specific type of underwear built for pants shitting mitigation
