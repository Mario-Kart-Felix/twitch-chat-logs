[0:13:18] <+D00msDayDan> I always wondered how much streamers acted like they were still streaming when playing on their own

[0:14:12] <%tanarath> OH NO
[0:14:13] <%valriot> I struggle to play games without background audio often, with some exceptions

[0:14:26] <%NopeBadguy> you did the same thing for stories 2
[0:14:27] <+BedHome> honestly to a lesser extent? had the same thing when i broke up with my gf. we used to play/stream together and to each other all the time.
[0:14:27] <+Dwarven_Gaming> so you've become a extrovert lol
[0:14:28] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat I have trouble playing games with out watching a stream too.
[0:14:28] <%CatastropheCorvid> It's like coming in on the day the warehouse is closed, and doing your job with no-one else around. It feels fucking weird.
[0:14:28] <LVL1_Scumbag> New goblins!

[0:14:33] <medoodoo> HABIT
[0:14:35] <@ssjklyco> I guest it is a LOST Judgement
[0:14:37] <%octotasty> Don't you have "you" games you play by yourself?
[0:14:37] <dds333a> @ahomeschooldropout bizarre
[0:14:37] <%BubbaRands> It’s conditioning
[0:14:38] <%IronOhki> I am a tiny baby nothing streamer and I already am starting to feel that "you could be streaming this" instinct.
[0:14:38] <%blastyoboots> having people with you to point stuff out and react with you!
[0:14:39] <wowzerman> well why play a game alone when you can play a game alone and make money
[0:14:39] <Blank9> do a goblins stream of Lost Judgement, where you cancel the stream and don't
[0:14:40] <ExpressNode> Work?
[0:14:46] <%Bailey__Gaming> GOBLIN REBIRTH
[0:14:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> The next mind goblin stream is Pat playing games without streaming. Dont ask me how it works

[0:14:54] <%AnthroMetal> content goblins
[0:14:56] <%shurtal> it's like how David Spade was recording lines for Emperor's New Groove, he was crap when in the booth, but they put a camera on him in the booth and he's way more animated @PatStaresAt
[0:14:56] <%asgard147> Choo Chooo HypeLove1
[0:14:57] <dds333a> yeah

[0:15:03] <%baka_sugoi> GOBLIN ORIGIN
[0:15:03] <%RayReborne> Pat i feel as if you shouldnt stream endwalker, just go on a two week vacay bender for your own sake
[0:15:04] <cartakus> It's like being in a house full of people and them you get a space just for you I guess
[0:15:08] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I understand it, I'm that way with concerts. I feel weird going to a concert alone.
[0:15:09] <+twohitgood> it's the ritualization of streaming a game rather than playing it privately. it's like if you have problem going to the bathroom in public. but instead, it's not being able to game in private.
[0:15:14] <+Dwarven_Gaming> it sounds like being a extrovert
[0:15:15] <susukouhai> What if u just turned the camera on and played judgment but streamn’t
[0:15:17] <Daxalog> Do you need to be a big time streamer to "get it"?

[0:32:05] <%JoshManVGH> Maybe he puts them on to become evil!
[0:32:06] <+TopTieramisu> those are wesker's eyes
[0:32:06] <%Mr_Pylon> Wesker IS sunglasses
[0:32:06] <KnightOfTrousers> ex-fucking-cuse me?!

[0:32:09] <T_Sasquatch> @ssjklyco LUL
[0:32:11] <%SaiyanShoto> But she doesn’t have a ponytail
[0:32:11] <medoodoo> where' barry?
[0:32:12] <%valcheese> boooooooooooooooooooo
[0:32:13] <KnightOfTrousers> I don't even play RE and I know that's a crime
[0:32:14] <+Plaguemelon> That's a sin
[0:32:14] <%Mister_McDerp> definitely not watching it now
[0:32:14] <%JamesCorck> Wesker without the hair and the glasses looks out of place.
[0:32:15] <%LaughingCatt> THEN HE ISNT WESKER
[0:32:15] <%Pappajimbo> he must were sunglasses even at night
[0:32:16] <%tanarath> uhhhhhhhhhh?
[0:32:16] <@tizz86> they'll be CG
[0:32:18] <%socktrot> wait, is the new resident evil movie separate from the Wife ones?
[0:32:19] <@Ranryu692> is this the one with Damien Darkh as Berkin?
[0:32:19] <%crimsonharvest> im sorry what they want to be taken seriously with this shit?
[0:32:19] <%TheAntiNihilist> wait weaker is in this?
[0:32:19] <ZeeJiggle> That's his WHOLE THING, THO
[0:32:20] <Profmcstevie> Sunglasses origin story
[0:32:22] <%SweetBeanAmin> Chris should have a different every scene to keep to canon
[0:32:23] <%SaiyanShoto> Also Wesker plays the piano instead of Jill
[0:32:25] <%amused_platypus> We need bolder characters where is my CGI sentient tofu?
[0:32:26] <%zeroarturia> WESKER WITH NO GLASSES IS BLASPHEMY
[0:32:26] <%SWFanatic> What a mansion
[0:32:27] <EynoStiles> thats the end of the movie he picks up the glasses.
[0:32:27] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @T_Sasquatch Corporate often likes to use inclusivity as a marketing ploy, not because they believe in it.
[0:32:27] <atgithursdays> weaker is so 2009
[0:32:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> feels like they're trying to separate themselves from most of RE's "intensity". I feel that's a mistake.
[0:32:32] <+BedHome> wesker would wear sunglasess at night ON A ROLLERCOASTER
[0:32:32] <%valcheese> yup
[0:32:33] <medoodoo> IS BARRY IN IT?!?!
[0:32:34] <%socktrot> i really liked the Wife resident evil movies
[0:32:35] <dds333a> wesker actually IS glasses
[0:32:35] <Alzero83> no shut up
[0:32:38] <%smoothwood07> he shot that dog real good
[0:32:38] <Alzero83> he doent need them

[0:32:39] <%asgard147> an ASSHOLE EVIL GUY
[0:32:40] <%BigCoffee> thats dark
[0:32:40] <%JoshManVGH> The dude they got to play him is also the ape man from Umbrella Academy, and I can't unsee that.
[0:32:45] <baltazar758> pre-boulder chris
[0:32:46] <%walternatorz> I'm hoping they spend a shot to establish their accessories and then they can discard them
[0:32:48] <Shwepie> Wesker is 50% sunglasses, 50% english accent post virus injection.

[0:32:57] <%AHomeschoolDropout> I think they're trying to make it more "serious" but like RE is just so fucking stupid you can't make it serious
[0:32:57] <@ssjklyco> It looked shitty, but the Movies they at least looked like Leon and Wesker
[0:32:58] <+Dumb_Parrot> Wesker is waaay too iconic to be just a dude in a movie
[0:32:58] <+nicoleymcquack> the sunglasses just invoke the assholeness that is wesker
[0:32:58] <%BigCoffee> Theme of "I wear my sunglasses at night" plays
[0:32:59] <%valcheese> there is no wesker..only glasses\
[0:33:01] <%SaiyanShoto> No Barry sucks
[0:33:04] <jorniev> waeker is that kinda guy
[0:33:04] <%BubbaRands> The sunglasses stay on during betrayal

[0:42:29] <EynoStiles> One piece is to big.
[0:42:29] <@ssjklyco> They will make Heiei 6ft tall

[0:42:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> Hakusho will be fine
[0:42:53] <+RealThiele> bad CGI time
[0:42:53] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Everything is fine.
[0:42:54] <+superchronicc> in order for one piece to be adapted they should just do the pilot manga
[0:42:54] <%maskofmichael> They'll adapt
[0:42:55] <dds333a> and there are giants and ahit too
[0:42:55] <%castlerock42> I'd go 80%.
[0:42:56] <%genocidal_cupcake> Nami looks so fucking WEIRD
[0:42:56] <@ssjklyco> Steve Buschemi can play Sanji
[0:42:58] <SIydoc> netflix is insane if they think a live action one piece is a good idea
[0:42:58] <%JoshManVGH> Can't  wait to see whay Gun Hair guy looks like

[0:43:46] <%SinnerEbru> @notandrew101 they did, it was japanese
[0:43:47] <%AncelDeLambert> the idea that you could adapt a TWO DECADE OLD SERIES THAT HASN'T ENDED is hubris of the purest form

[0:43:48] <LoudmicRPG> @PatStaresAt and NONE OF IT IS FUCKING FILLER

[0:43:51] <%asgard147> SG-1 is great
[0:43:52] <%BigCoffee> Stargate is the shit
[0:43:53] <%ElkRiverDog> Suddenly Disney's obsession with adapting their catalogue to live action doesn't seem so bad anymore
[0:43:53] <%WackyGear> SG1 rocks!!!

[0:44:13] <%doomunderthestairs> yyh could be good
[0:44:13] <$realm_forge> The only ruined planet is Earth 🌍
[0:44:13] <%KnightOfTrousers> They get some neat interior sets though
[0:44:14] <%toolofparanoia> Watching it every sunday with my friends
[0:44:18] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> What's with obsession with making everything live action?
[0:44:20] <+Deekman> It’s so good. I’m gutted it’s all removed from Canada netflix
[0:44:21] <SIydoc> stargate atlantis is ok and stargate universe is trash
[0:44:21] <%maskofmichael> Favorite moment?

[0:44:23] <Gorgs7> Occasionally it looks like south dakota
[0:44:24] <%JoshManVGH> I like a Farscape, which is a gooye puppet Star Trek with more sas.
[0:44:24] <%BigCoffee> Yo Pat do you remember the Groundhog day episode in SG1 ?
[0:44:24] <cartakus> Not even 1 desert?

[0:44:27] <stantheman_97> galactic biodiversity is surprisingly low
[0:44:29] <boomstickery> is ti like dr who and that quarry in wales?
[0:44:30] <dds333a> it gets kinda weird
[0:44:31] <+BedHome> As SG: Atlantis says in the opening: YOU ARE WATCHING A SPIN OFF
[0:44:32] <ShoMibu> better off doing a dectictive conan live.
[0:44:33] <akitanito> single biome universe

[0:45:17] <%KnightOfTrousers> Showing Jaffa rebels how cool a P90 is was a great moment

[0:45:38] <%tank7013> @NigelSchnauzerpug Western audiences haven't really had a history of taking anything animated seriously unless it's pixar or disney. Like it's gotten better over the years but live action still just straight performs better
[0:45:40] <%AncelDeLambert> there's TWO groundhog day episodes just off the top of my head
[0:45:43] <%WackyGear> what about the time loop episode?

[2:25:51] <%RayReborne> yeah, no
[2:25:51] <lehvak182> darn
[2:25:52] <%Mr_Pylon> because Atlus? Yeah
[2:25:53] <%AgniBrandt> Unfortunate but understandable
[2:25:54] <brachydios777> Hey guys, remember when Big Boss killed a Rathalos?
[2:25:55] <%alcors_wisdom> i want there to be a game where instead of a delay theyre like "yeah the dev team just crushed it its coming out early" to really fuck with people
[2:25:55] <+TaurusOxford> that's fair
[2:25:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> That's fair.
[2:25:56] <shevan123> atlus murked it
[2:25:57] <p3niletrauma> The best time to heal is before you die
[2:26:01] <OkamiDude15> fair
[2:26:06] <Kalakukkoo> cook the pastarats
[2:26:06] <%chiazam> No I don't know
[2:26:07] <brachydios777> Fair
[2:26:07] <rosysyntax> ATLUS hates streamers unfortunately. Bizarre shit
[2:26:07] <%RaziWraith> Pat doesn't heal until he has no hp left, guys. LUL
[2:26:09] <akitanito> why is atlus like this
[2:26:10] <%Idziman> that sucks, but it makes snese
[2:26:11] <Mattais88> Reasonable
[2:26:12] <Teras_ode> understandable
[2:26:18] <%Broand> That's fine, that's one of the games I was gonna play so I wasn't gonna watch
[2:26:18] <+alternative_flu> I keep forgetting Atlus is so whack about streaming their games
[2:26:20] <%maenos2> people die wjen they are killed pat, so heal up
[2:26:22] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt would you go back to No More Heroes 3?
[2:26:23] <+twohitgood> literally their loss. one of their biggest promotional platforms gone.
[2:26:23] <lloyddboy> RATLAS
[2:26:28] <Mattais88> But the games still gonna be sick, right?
[2:26:39] <akitanito> I wonder
[2:26:40] <+trackles_64> His father did
[2:26:43] <Teras_ode> his dad Kappa
[2:26:46] <+JustToWatch> Elmo
[2:26:47] <OkamiDude15> its a mystery
[2:26:47] <+tetraes> did Pat ever finish Judgment?
[2:26:48] <%Piemen99> Who knows
[2:26:50] <fancymelibe> this equally spaced procession of garbage is ruining my immersion
[2:26:53] <%toolofparanoia> gee
[2:26:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Just got here, What are you thoughts on the Artist in DBD meh or okay?
[2:26:55] <%alcors_wisdom> ya'know they say dogs resemble their owners
[2:26:55] <@GeneralSCPatton> Fuck Atlus, all my homies hate Atlus. But for real, the death of y'all's P5 LP killed the only chance I would have given that series.
[2:26:56] <%za7az> Elmo
[2:26:58] <+alternative_flu> It was chat. Chat is to blame.
[2:27:02] <%Idziman> nagCheck
[2:27:04] <akitanito> tapping the flamethrower seems like a better strat
[2:27:10] <%RayReborne> i fully plan on playing smtV when it comes out but fuck Atlus's streaming bullshit
[2:27:24] <%tanarath> who could have done it?
[2:27:35] <%maskofmichael> She bird lady
[2:27:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> SHE SHOOTS PAINT BIRDS AT PEOPLE
[2:27:36] <Dunmarkh> she has weird hands
[2:27:37] <@Lion_kun> I only got into P5 and played it, P4, P5R and Strikers because of the 3 episode LP you did of P5 on the old channel.
[2:27:39] <brachydios777> Remember when Big Boss killed a Monster Hunter Monster Version of Metal Gear Rex?
[2:28:00] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[2:28:00] <lehvak182> i didn't see anyone stream Neo TWEWY also
[2:28:01] <%maskofmichael> She shoot bird cannon
[2:28:11] <lehvak182> is Neo TWEWY stream poison?
[2:28:17] <Dio_TR> LUL LUL
[2:28:21] <%alcors_wisdom> you dont know that the big bad wolf wasnt a girl
[2:28:26] <rosysyntax> @brachydios777 We can thank that talking cat for that precious encounter.
[2:28:32] <%bassoontyphoon> What are any of us really doing
[2:28:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt She shoots Ink birds that can go through walls. If it hits you she can see you through walls and attempt another shot. If she hits you again through a wall she gets a hit
[2:28:36] <Dio_TR> @lehvak182 it’s because of the music
[2:28:53] <%valriot> TWEWY UwU
[2:28:54] <akitanito> what were you thinking
[2:28:54] <%maenos2> @lehvak182 I want to say kzexcellent did.  Maybe Mr. feel too?
[2:28:55] <lehvak182> LUL LUL LUL
[2:29:00] <%RayReborne> Is Dumpster Lady off mic? Kappa
[2:29:05] <brachydios777> @rosysyntax Also he believes in Santa Claus
[2:29:05] <lehvak182> @dio_tr yeah... figured
[2:29:18] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @doc_ock_rokc I feel too many kills have abilities to just know where survivors are.
[2:29:29] <Dunmarkh> @RayReborne she's in the kitchen, no mics in there
[2:29:36] <%Wallabri> WEMMY HAMMO
[2:29:48] <lehvak182> @maenos2 ah ok ok
[2:29:49] <brachydios777> Never forget that Big Boss believes in Santa
[2:29:53] <%RayReborne> its got a SWORD
[2:29:57] <akitanito> now the monster sound makes sense
[2:29:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> trash monster
[2:30:03] <rosysyntax> oh wow, totally different encounter with the rats. this game rules.
[2:30:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @NigelSchnauzerpug that is because tons of survivor perks are "Fuck you you can't find me:
[2:30:06] <%SWFanatic> rat king
[2:30:11] <kinkade_77> rat king?
[2:30:13] <akitanito> but unlimited flamethrower

[3:14:32] <%cade_calrayn> ... is Paige doing that right now?
[3:14:33] <%doomunderthestairs> because you need the butter to melt a bit on the bread the fuck pat
[3:14:33] <All_Salt> NOT EVEN COVERAGE
[3:14:35] <%CatastropheCorvid> DIGNITY IS THE REASON PAT
[3:14:35] <+snurtlord> dont lick the butter pat you fucking psycho
[3:14:36] <%alcors_wisdom> you could i suppose but at that point why not make a butter ball
[3:14:36] <+rdark_ksu> dont contaminate the butter
[3:14:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> Butter face
[3:14:37] <%Maids4lyfe> just eat the stick
[3:14:37] <brachydios777> Fucking what!?
[3:14:37] <+RealCynder> those are identical eating experiences.
[3:14:37] <Gray_LoFi> How are you supposed to toast it, just melt the whole bar?
[3:14:38] <%barrakuta371> No, but I always just melt the butter with the microwave first
[3:14:38] <%shurtal> Thats the path of insanity
[3:14:39] <@Ranryu692> if you do that you don't get to make fun of the way Paige eats things anymore
[3:14:40] <AsHeadsIsTails> DansGame
[3:14:40] <cnry_m> Can lick w the mouth full
[3:14:43] <akitanito> you can drink peanut butter and eat bread
[3:14:45] <ZaerichAnakalypton> You want the butter to melt into the bread
[3:14:45] <fakeburg> Ruin a stick of butter no Pat nooooo
[3:14:46] <OkamiDude15> so other people can use the butter?
[3:14:47] <%twistedj3ster> It's like eating fries and squeezing ketchup in your mouth, yeah
[3:14:49] <%chiazam> WHAT?
[3:14:51] <mr_sups> Eat dry cerial and drink milk
[3:14:52] <%Ne1son> Use gun
[3:14:57] <%CalderGaming> @akitanito DRINK?

[3:15:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> or that
[3:15:12] <%tanarath> Just heat the bread then scrape the butter on the bread
[3:15:14] <%MegadBlitz> eat dry ramen and drink boiling hot water
[3:15:19] <BromineQueen> Melting and dipping is a much better idea.
[3:15:23] <%darklordfodder> you can also take a bite of bread and a spoon of peanut butter
[3:15:41] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh this part
[3:15:45] <%CatastropheCorvid> That's like... I ate ham, drank mayo, then ate bread and my butt thinks that was a sandwitch
[3:15:47] <%SinnerEbru> or get a butter dish and keep it on the counter, always soft butter
[3:15:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh wow

[3:22:15] <rosysyntax> @Zaphire_Saucypants You can, but the ones in the path of the lasers have nothing, so there's no point.
[3:22:21] <%G_Thunders> Is there really nothing you can do once the alarm starts?
[3:22:21] <@ssjklyco> Use quick save now

[3:41:14] <rosysyntax> there are quite a few if you want to backtrack...
[3:41:24] <%Piemen99> Quick save
[3:41:27] <$lotharrio> But what if there's candy in them?
[3:41:27] <%MegadBlitz> thats also potentially a war crime i think
[3:41:30] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Maybe you could just lightly touch their faces?
[3:41:39] <%Broand> there was one on the second floor iirc
[3:41:44] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I'm not sure if there IS a quick save in this game
[3:41:54] <+JustToWatch> you stole someone's glass eye to suck on like a piece of candy
[3:41:55] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Gross Pat, I don't want to hear that
[3:42:03] <homestylewaffles> @Zaphire_Saucypants portable toilet
[3:42:03] <Estuko> go up to them and gently glide your finger across their lips, really mess them up
[3:42:05] <brachydios777> Geneva suggestion
[3:42:09] <Dio_TR> There is a quick wave it’s the potty
[3:42:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @homestylewaffles oh yeaaah. I never used those.
[3:42:31] <Dio_TR> You have to empty the potty bucket at the WC to use it again tho
[3:42:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> nice find.

[3:46:26] <%afronooch> $PBCK
[3:46:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I didn't know this game was on Switch either
[3:46:37] <rosysyntax> PSA: Unmetal has a demo on Steam. Buy the game if you liked it - support cool games :)
[3:46:38] <+xerotwo> LUL
[3:46:41] <churropoppa> LUL

[3:47:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I am already invested I might just bite and buy it on Switch
[3:47:05] <%afronooch> @SirGO0SE same time same mind my man
[3:47:13] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> w00t
[3:47:15] <Estuko> WELCOME TO FF!4
[3:47:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but I should try the demo
[3:47:34] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Damn tankies
[3:47:46] <%darklordfodder> If you switch PCs, remember to redo your hotbars
[3:47:50] <SovPho> literally just basic tank stuff lol
[3:47:51] <luftraumm1> watch tutorials for each duty?
[3:47:52] <+RoByte2> Use Arm's Length as a cooldown, the slow is REALLY effective on large packs
[3:47:55] <Shwepie> Read tool tips, read them again, then read them one more time.
[3:47:56] <brachydios777> Sucks I don’t have a Playstation or PC to try it out
[3:48:03] <Estuko> Kiss your healers on the forehead please.
[3:48:15] <All_Salt> TURN BOSSES INTO BEYBLADES
[3:48:21] <%AlteisenReiseZ> As a MNK player. PLEASE DO NOT SPIN THE BOSS. PLEASE.
[3:48:23] <MusouMiko> Tanking is literally about figuring out how to avoid AoE while moving as absolutely little as possible
[3:48:30] <Visorak6> WALL TO WALL
[3:48:31] <%afronooch> ALWAYS USE COOLDOWN
[3:48:45] <%bravebravesrobin> you've often said the generation including the PS 3 was the worst, but what is your top 5 from it? Cheer500
[3:48:46] <akitanito> but goblins
[3:48:50] <%CalderGaming> DO let your healer know you're pulling big
[3:48:52] <%cvp5127> spin to win got it
[3:48:53] <%afronooch> You trip? Cooldown. You Sneeze? Cool down
[3:49:04] <luftraumm1> oh ask if the party wants big pre light pulls
[3:49:10] <ZeeJiggle> For a long time, I thought "Slow" meant their movement speed decreased.
[3:49:17] <%Alazull> Use that shit on cooldown
[3:49:22] <ZeeJiggle> It does not. It's their attack rate.
[3:49:23] <RushUnplugged> Use EVERYTHING, just don't overlap them, it's a waste
[3:49:38] <%cvp5127> bork
[3:49:38] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> THAT BOI NEED A KISS
[3:49:39] <luftraumm1> bork
[3:49:45] <Estuko> Let your healer know the plan, Tanks tend to be looked at as the leader due to responsibility and being first. And kiss your healers.
[3:49:57] <%cade_calrayn> he craves violence
[3:49:58] <jett_eyes> and he never came back
[3:49:59] <%cade_calrayn> and borkening
[3:50:09] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> I swear to god, we better hear smooches
[3:50:27] <FrostedZaibatsu> Our dog was barking all last night too. Wanted to suplex her
[3:50:33] <%AncelDeLambert> that butt-pad sure is giving the camera 120%
[3:50:33] <%darklordfodder> Run past packs so that enemies face away from the rest of your party
[3:50:34] <luftraumm1> ppl might not always answer, but ask if they are familiar with what you're running
[3:50:46] <+JustToWatch> Ghosts
[3:50:46] <%Anime_Flux> And you fell for it
[3:50:47] <%cade_calrayn> he was just announcing his departure
[3:50:47] <Dunmarkh> get nae naed
[3:50:47] <Dr_Mooose> gottem
[3:50:48] <+CapnClassix> Had to show you he can use stairs
[3:50:50] <luftraumm1> he wants you to go to bed
[3:50:52] <%lildashots> he wants you to perceive him, if only for a moment
[3:50:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> "Whatdo you want" Not you bitch
[3:50:55] <%maskofmichael> He wants attention
[3:50:57] <%Wallabri> psaDogchamp "Naught but thine attention, father"
[3:50:59] <%cade_calrayn> he needed you to know that he's leaving
[3:51:01] <brachydios777> My hope was the whole FF and Xbox collab going on would lead to FF14 being on Xbox, but I don’t think that will happen anytime soon
[3:51:01] <%strakillias> He wants his mama to be down stairs
[3:51:09] <%castlerock42> I think he just wants to fuck with you.
[3:51:10] <+alternative_flu> He's trying to warn you about the stairs bro!
[3:51:11] <%darklordfodder> he's warning you of the ghost
[3:51:11] <M0untain_wolf> Showing you his POWER
[3:51:16] <NeroInfinite> "Nothin, Gott 'em"
[3:51:22] <ammobasket> Follow, obvs
[3:51:23] <%tanarath> "Love, Father."
[3:51:24] <DrunkenDice> atpRtsd
[3:51:32] <+GloriouSpacenoid> It's k lol
[3:51:50] <+GloriouSpacenoid> Woolie didn't even wave at me when I saw him so you win by default
[3:51:53] <%DianaTheAscian> thats a bout right
[3:51:55] <%RayReborne> my moms dogs love to go to the back door as if they want out and then just sit there with the door open like assholes. dogs be acting pointless sometimes
