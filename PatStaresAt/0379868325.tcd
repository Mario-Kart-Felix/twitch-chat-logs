[0:11:10] <+theottree> what doesn't pat like I mised it
[0:11:10] <$cureneckbeard> Risk of Rain just gets harder in real-time so you win by being fast
[0:11:11] <+moondog_> SHORT AND LUPUS
[0:11:11] <KaptainKappathe5th> that game is ok but it becomes godlike once you get some fun shit
[0:11:13] <%Spydurman> what do you dislike about Risk of Rain?
[0:11:14] <%lewdskeletor13> I can’t imagine y’all having kids
[0:11:15] <%InsaneJackLondon> its all right once you unlock a few things
[0:11:16] <%AncelDeLambert> Roguelikes are all terrible, eat it, losers
[0:11:16] <+Tevvy> thats a ridiculous hot take
[0:11:17] <+Cavumentum> The two OCDs would cancel out and create a perfect baby
[0:11:18] <%lewdskeletor13> It’d be scary
[0:11:21] <+grug_bread> they should rename risk of rain to risk of not getting a sequel because it sucks
[0:11:24] <+Papafleish> dab cells
[0:11:24] <hntronium> I remember that
[0:11:27] <bananachode> the sun would catch that baby ablaze within seconds
[0:11:27] <%Drchandragupta> I always assumed it was meme OCD and not actual clinical OCE

[0:16:18] <Caidezes> Kreia is super right.
[0:16:23] <dekkitout> "Bring balance to the force, destroy the Sith." best dogma ever
[0:16:24] <%VanaSkiller> One Piece anime in like a month

[0:16:31] <TwistedVerse> pat is a dirty hunter ex hunter fanboy
[0:16:33] <Gray_skies1993> Kreia isn’t the best Star Wars char imo, but she’s pretty damn up there for me.
[0:16:33] <%lewdskeletor13> Man Kotor 2 is way better than anyone gives it credit for
[0:16:36] <captainthunderwolf> @damienlunas Kreia is probably completely correct, the Force is fucking evil.
[0:16:38] <damienlunas> "When you think about it, I kind of DID WIN."
[0:16:38] <jeecay> Woolie lied to you chat. the 90's hunter hunter series is good
[0:16:40] <%jiin6> Kreia is old and smells bad, like pat
[0:16:42] <%nofestu2> Fuck you Bitch Ricky!

[1:08:48] <g15835> @4thot he's not that mad, tbh. also, this game and possibly Woolie caused a resurgence in the old Titanfall 2 servers.
[1:08:56] <dekkitout> no shit the free game is going to charge for the premium pass

[1:09:24] <waifoong98> riPepperonis
[1:09:26] <Run44forrest> dont always go for the kill
[1:09:29] <%VanaSkiller> got some good hits in tho
[1:09:30] <%commanderclaw> Don't confirm the kill when the others are threats
[1:09:32] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> This was a sneaking mission Pat
[1:09:33] <InsomniacPersona> Dont focus downed enemies @AngriestPat focus the ones still standing
[1:09:34] <strezof> why did you circle around them
[1:09:38] <Migatte_no_Gokui_Yamcha> Almost :(
[1:09:39] <+GoodShotCam> nobody cares
[1:09:39] <%MagickBurritoh> 1 for 2
[1:09:39] <4THOT> is this his first look at the game?
[1:09:46] <%RaikenTB> that's what we like to call small damage.

[1:09:59] <%QueequegTheater> Paige can only damage herself
[1:10:00] <JanusII> You should focus on who's still up since you don't have to finish them off if the squad dies.
[1:10:02] <InsomniacPersona> LUL
[1:10:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige damaged the toilet last night

[1:10:49] <%NWR_James> piss yourself for bits
[1:10:51] <g15835> @4thot no, more like 2nd-3rd. Pat didn't like the game earlier, but the ping system won him over. Woolie enjoyed it more firsthand.
[1:10:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Just use a catheter
[1:10:52] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Use the cathider pat

[1:11:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> me
[1:11:38] <T_Sasquatch> (ditto)
[1:11:41] <%QueequegTheater> Anybody want to help me study for my linear algebra midterm
[1:11:49] <TwistedVerse> haHAA
[1:11:52] <Endocrom> This song always reminds me of a song in Killer7
[1:11:52] <ebonifragaria> Ew school
[1:11:52] <%QueequegTheater> Or just put a bullet in my head, either one
[1:11:59] <dashmatt> this shit slaps
[1:11:59] <%IMDRanged> Just go to a WalMart and you can see some examples
[1:12:06] <TwistedVerse> oH
[1:12:13] <%QueequegTheater> I
[1:12:19] <g15835> @queequegtheater what's the difference between that and regular algebra?
[1:12:23] <TwistedVerse> DAD
[1:12:28] <%MagickBurritoh> That was fast
[1:12:32] <dekkitout> ack, i thought dropping out was supposed to let me escape math
[1:12:32] <Cthulos> Colostomy is for#2 chat
[1:12:33] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Use grenades more
[1:12:37] <T_Sasquatch> linear algebra ? are you a teenager ?
[1:12:38] <%Sephrim> MIDAS TOUCH
[1:12:39] <%QueequegTheater> @g15835 Linear algebra is sometimes referred to as Calculus 6
[1:12:39] <Migatte_no_Gokui_Yamcha> Did you wash your hands though? PunOko
[1:12:40] <%st4rrytea> did you even wash your hands
[1:12:42] <TwistedVerse> piss mcgee over here, pissing all fast n shit
[1:12:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Is linear Algebra like Advance Algebra? Cuz that's as far as I got
[1:12:45] <dsauce999> NO, bring back the good part of the stream, with the music and volta-bass animations
[1:12:45] <count_bob> Make Paige play!
[1:12:46] <ValKilmersCareer> Pat did you wash your hands?
[1:12:47] <%theo_marks> she must have BREATHED at them
[1:12:47] <%QueequegTheater> @T_Sasquatch I'm in college
[1:12:48] <%DomunDomunDomun> WASH YOUR HANDS
[1:12:48] <arcaderabbit48> Paige touches EVERYTHING
[1:12:53] <Valdorick> She infected your computer with the lupus
[1:12:55] <ShichiNoBushi> It was Shellmo.
[1:12:58] <ChibiKuro> elaISee
[1:12:59] <TwistedVerse> wash your face
[1:13:00] <%maskedriderhero> DID YOU
[1:13:04] <kabishen> lies
[1:13:06] <dsauce999> But Papa always washes his hands
[1:13:06] <%QueequegTheater> Linear Algebra comes after Multivariable Calculus, guys
[1:13:08] <ValKilmersCareer> We can smell you pat!
[1:13:09] <suikudo> Its a demolition D thing
[1:13:11] <g15835> @queequegtheater 🙃 hah, sorry pal, I don't own a gun.
[1:13:12] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Think of everything in the game in terms of positioning advantage.
[1:13:13] <ValKilmersCareer> We can smell the piss hands!
[1:13:14] <TwistedVerse> shine it up with armorall
[1:13:18] <%maskedriderhero> Dont wake the sleeping cat
[1:13:23] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Use the Colostomy bag @AngriestPat
[1:13:25] <ebonifragaria> Who's smelling?!
[1:13:29] <TwistedVerse> wOO
[1:13:30] <suikudo> @AngriestPat In Demo's stream if you say wash your hand he has a bot that says papa always washes his hands
[1:13:31] <%QueequegTheater> We can smell you Pat
[1:13:33] <Valdorick> We don't know Pat "I see garbage on the ground and I laugh", who do we ask why you cleaned your hands!?
[1:13:34] <+Meiou> you dont know me! i could have smellovision
[1:13:35] <%MagickBurritoh> don't go out in the open
[1:13:35] <Drunkengen> High Ground
[1:13:38] <%TheMattman1313> it means I HAVE THE HIGH GROUND
[1:13:39] <%Prism_Wing> lab, pat Kappa
[1:13:39] <Valdorick> why*
[1:13:39] <Skibopadoo> take the high ground
[1:13:40] <+SimplesRock> Flank all day.
[1:13:41] <%RaikenTB> gain the high ground
[1:13:42] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Negate their cover and high ground, flush them out, flank them
[1:13:44] <dekkitout> situational awareness and high ground
[1:13:46] <mongol_800> @AngriestPat Fav gun?
[1:13:46] <ValKilmersCareer> Dont fight in big open places where its easier for you to die. Get high as you can to see better
[1:13:46] <+OperatorPlease> people in cover can shoot you, but you can't shoot people in cover
[1:13:48] <+OperatorPlease> never give up cover
[1:13:48] <%mister___doctor> Go wash your hands, fucker
[1:13:52] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Be onion wan with the high ground
[1:13:56] <%QueequegTheater> reduce this matrix to reduced row echelon form
[1:13:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Scratch that. I only got past 1 semester of Advanced Algebra
[1:14:00] <Drunkengen> catch them with their pants down
[1:14:03] <dsauce999> But Papa always washes his hands
[1:14:04] <RetributionP> is pat the newest ultra dumb
[1:14:07] <+SimplesRock> I like getting close and flanking.
[1:14:08] <misterspotswood> high ground isnt a meme
[1:14:09] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Use the gun and bullets to your advantage
[1:14:09] <+mogamehah> WTF LOL ***
[1:14:13] <%commanderclaw> Easier to retreat
[1:14:14] <benjiFG> well have you watched star wars
[1:14:14] <%Idziman> gravity
[1:14:15] <%MagickBurritoh> you head is visible while their body is visible
[1:14:16] <Flamefist360> because star wars
[1:14:17] <dekkitout> angle of depression > angle of elevation
[1:14:18] <+EdgeSetter> they have cover
[1:14:21] <+RokettoOsuka> Pat, poor Pat.
[1:14:21] <%TheMattman1313> Cuz you can usually see them first
[1:14:23] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Gravity is a thing
[1:14:24] <dekkitout> ie, head glitching
[1:14:24] <%Nobrev> go for the high ground, flank, keep defensible positions etc. high ground gives you more cover and gives them less cover @AngriestPat
[1:14:24] <%Gatzarlok> Because you have cover looking over, while their bodies will be completely exposed.
[1:14:24] <$MajorCrasher> people don't look up
[1:14:24] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat grenade arcs, weapon arcs, and you have less body showing from your position than they do from theirs shooting up at you
[1:14:26] <+Silentman0> it's harder for them to shoot you and easier for you to shoot them???
[1:14:28] <+skm742> @angriestpat High ground is good, because the floor acts as a shield
[1:14:29] <%Rorinator> You can take cover just by backing up
[1:14:29] <Drunkengen> some people dont even look up until you shoot them
[1:14:31] <%QueequegTheater> It's easier to hit someone below you than above
[1:14:33] <TwistedVerse> all im saying is... dont die LUL
[1:14:35] <ValKilmersCareer> Easier to retreat, Easier to get head shots, and most people arent going to be looking at the sky while they run around
[1:14:36] <+SimplesRock> High ground gives you some more visibility into their cover, but distance in this game reduces your ability to kill way more than like PUBG
[1:14:40] <+emperor_z> You can see a lot, and it acts as cover. You can easily retreat when needed, and you only need to expose your head
[1:14:42] <Futurecity10> Because basic rules of engagement you fool
[1:14:42] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Josef_Stryker) (warning)
[1:14:46] <%Shindeil> My depression has different angles.
[1:14:46] <$MajorCrasher> People don't look up
[1:14:52] <ebonifragaria> Everyone knows the high ground is better
[1:14:53] <+fizzguy47> didn't you watch the star wars prequels?
[1:14:54] <%MagickBurritoh> They see your head but you can see their body
[1:14:55] <%Gatzarlok> @AngriestPat looking down, the ground becomes shield for you, for them they will be in the open
[1:14:55] <+RushUnplugged> you have to reverse the flux of the positron bodulator to disengage the deflector dish, PAT, duh
[1:14:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Same reason as Gears of war Pat they have a clear line on your head you have a clear line or there legs
[1:14:56] <+OperatorPlease> shooting over a cliff gives you almost perfect cover
[1:14:57] <+RokettoOsuka> Angles for line of sight are different due to terrain.
[1:14:58] <%QueequegTheater> DON'T TRY IT
[1:15:00] <Pookiedaexzile> different damage
[1:15:02] <%RaikenTB> that is too much for you, Pat. Drink 1/3 of it and give the rest to Paige.
[1:15:03] <TwistedVerse> big brain energy in the chat
[1:15:03] <ValKilmersCareer> So since you are high your angle means that they wont be able to take cover as you.
[1:15:05] <%TheMattman1313> They can see over the cliff as you move, you can't see them when they walk away from the edge.
[1:15:06] <Josef_Stryker> HIGH GROUND
[1:15:06] <+Tevvy> why wouldnt high ground be better, its not a mechanical thing its just.. strategy man
[1:15:06] <dsauce999> People don't look up, making the birds our greatest enemies
[1:15:09] <%MagickBurritoh> BAD STRAT
[1:15:10] <%Idziman> headshots are easier when you look down vs looking up
[1:15:15] <+SimplesRock> You got it pat! Approach and flank. Keep the enemy on their toes, don’t let them have initiative
[1:15:16] <%theo_marks> solid plan
[1:15:16] <+Rikka66> go outside, throw rocks from the top of a hill, then from the bottom
[1:15:17] <ValKilmersCareer> literally worst strat
[1:15:17] <RantingRavager> Strong strat
[1:15:18] <%theo_marks> works for me
[1:15:19] <+Meiou> no you run around flailing going SAVE ME THEY SHOOTING ME
[1:15:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Dogs can't look up
[1:15:21] <Amardeux> thats a bad strat
[1:15:22] <popcultureaficionado> Close quaters ftw
[1:15:23] <Run44forrest> pat has to look up
[1:15:28] <TwistedVerse> just shank em in the back, pat
[1:15:31] <kabishen> sight cover surprise
[1:15:32] <dashmatt> kill them all, pat
[1:15:35] <@Mechz71> BIG UP STUPID
[1:15:35] <T_Sasquatch> @QueequegTheater LUL for some reason I thought you meant basic algebra. I did linear algebra in my first semester of the 2nd year of college
[1:15:35] <+SimplesRock> If the enemy gets a choice in the matter, you’re starting with a disadvantage
[1:15:36] <JanusII> Shoot from better places basically.
[1:15:36] <%ashhkier_> Hey pat whats your favorite gun in this game so far?
[1:15:36] <%QueequegTheater> Run at them screaming about colostomy bags, they'll never see it coming
