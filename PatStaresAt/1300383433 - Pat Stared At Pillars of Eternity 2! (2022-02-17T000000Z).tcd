[0:11:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> @alexandus_ Liam has said multiple times that he and Pat were never friends.
[0:11:53] <%Shonen_hero> if anyone bought from Digital Storm, their PC's are good, but their customer service is TRASH

[0:15:16] <+polothegreatest> Cyberpunk had hype CaitlynS
[0:15:18] <%NitronStreams> "It too hard me get stuck 2 hours in" - A game Journalist
[0:15:18] <@Lion_kun> I have three other people other than you and Paige I follow who are going to play it, gonna be interesting to see all the different things I missed in my playthrough
[0:15:26] <+griffball13> Kirby?
[0:15:32] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> 9/10 my skies are rimmed
[0:15:36] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Vlc is so cool
[0:15:36] <%PocketBearIllustrator> do skies have holes to rim?
[0:15:41] <%NitronStreams> LUL
[0:15:43] <@PrefectusCorgi> It will break Calling IT
[0:15:54] <%YakumoYomi> They'd just fake a review, like they did for the PS3 version of Skyrim. No way any of those 9/10 reviews played that game at launch on PS3
[0:15:54] <Flame_Water> good ol vlc, plays all my pirated shit
[0:16:01] <%AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Good job pushing the button!

[0:16:26] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:16:28] <@Lion_kun> If they gave you the copy this second, would you end the stream to go play it?
[0:16:28] <%BinaryFireball> you mean they LIED?

[0:16:50] <Vohs_Bru> so the sky is blue?
[0:16:58] <quantras6> It's really weird hearing about people saying "man the ps3 version of this game was AWFUL" and I don't recall any major issues with them.
[0:17:07] <Vermillion129> That sound familiar for many games LUL
[0:17:12] <ape_hawk> didnt cyberpunk just come out yesterday, though?
[0:17:20] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt It's ok I have arrived
[0:17:21] <Vohs_Bru> or Fallout 3
[0:17:25] <quantras6> I played and finished all of Skyrim and New Vegas on launch and don't recall anything major
[0:17:26] <+cvp5127> pat check your email
[0:17:31] <KyberNasse> "8/10, I wish you could make something out of the Dragon bones"
[0:17:33] <%Bluwizard21> we can start now\
[0:17:38] <cureneckbeard> When Pokemon BDSP came out there were a bunch of sites with BDSP guides that just copied old Diamond/Pearl guides. You could tell because they'd reference like the gambling shop that didn't exist any more
[0:17:38] <%PocketBearIllustrator> it's psaPeapoh time
[0:17:45] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Let us go play fallout new vegas again
[0:17:47] <+Mrbaconator> C O N T E N T

[0:17:57] <%SovPho> I stopped playing POE2 when I learned that there is a finite number of ships to hunt. Idk why it affected me so bad but it really took me out of it.

[0:18:40] <+sonofthedeepsouth> But were you vaccinated?
[0:18:41] <Vohs_Bru> should have put on a mask on his ahole
[0:18:43] <%BinaryFireball> you really shouldnt prescribe a dose of pain
[0:18:46] <BigFingerRo> remove that man from existence
[0:18:47] <scrumbotime> i think you legally can run someone over with a vehicle
[0:18:48] <%Shonen_hero> or threw him out a window
[0:18:54] <+sasparillatango> you'd have to prove you got it from them

[0:19:01] <Vohs_Bru> there should have been
[0:19:10] <%IamGrapes> is it just me or is Pat's camera have a higher framerate?

[0:20:16] <+total_overkill> cash out on the desperation?
[0:20:19] <%Bluwizard21> It's the hottest shit of the year for that past 3 years
[0:20:21] <+sasparillatango> somewhat ironically, lots of people made way for Cyberpunk
[0:20:24] <%SovPho> wait which game?
[0:20:24] <%Logoth_> Babylon's fall isn't running away

[0:22:02] <%NitronStreams> Congrats Pat
[0:22:03] <SolumFuturae> Clap well done
[0:22:06] <boatzndhoez> d69Derp
[0:22:09] <@Lion_kun> Oh thank God, it's Chill Pat, so much better than present angry Pat
[0:22:10] <%AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Past Pasta Rat!
[0:22:12] <%BinaryFireball> lol
[0:22:17] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Smooth and silky voice segment tonight
[0:22:19] <+polothegreatest> multitasking plaguePog
[0:22:20] <quantras6> Past Pat is stronger then present Pat
[0:22:23] <%IamGrapes> PastStaresAt
[0:22:28] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Where beard. Portrait lie
[0:22:32] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Ooga Booga
[0:22:44] <%crimsonharvest> pastarat brand still recognized love it
[0:22:46] <quantras6> @sonofthedeepsouth elf no have beard pls understand
[0:22:49] <Treasure_Vault> @quantras6 Past Pat could take Present Pat's lunch money
[0:22:49] <@Lion_kun> Present Pat is such an asshole, not like Past pat who is the best.
[0:23:07] <quantras6> Past Pat grows in strength every day
[0:23:10] <skyshinecrusader> Pat sounds weird pre recorded
[0:23:10] <Zebroneath> Past Pat is so fucking chill
[0:23:26] <@Lion_kun> Past pat can only get stronger as more past replaces the present.
[0:23:33] <%Brassnarwhal> @quantras6 they can only grow shitty middle school tier facial hair so they all shave and lie about it
[0:23:34] <tigerfang86> Pat without the burden of the present is very chill
[0:23:35] <Treasure_Vault> Present Pat can never hope to ever be as strong as Past Pat
[0:23:37] <+griffball13> i hope im that chill when im dead
[0:23:44] <KyberNasse> I like Pat's VA
[0:23:45] <%notsoy> guy is pretty chill about having been left to die over some loot
[0:23:47] <quantras6> future pat is the weakest link
[0:23:54] <%BinaryFireball> i hope im hot when im dead
[0:23:54] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Sixh sense perk?
[0:24:07] <%Brassnarwhal> @KyberNasse I prefer greggs
[0:24:09] <+griffball13> pas pat is always more powerful because there is always more of him
[0:24:10] <cureneckbeard> Heh the ship is called the Defiant, like in the startrek.
[0:24:13] <%MrMegaJackpots> @Lion_kun disco elysium (2019)
[0:24:14] <Treasure_Vault> Although, Present Pat does have chili...
[0:24:16] <%BinaryFireball> I wanna be taxidermized in a speedo and aviators
[0:24:20] <%redthebaron> prequel pat
[0:24:39] <%Shonen_hero> god there's so many modern CRPGs nowadays that all start out on a beach
[0:24:53] <%IamGrapes> "bruh you killed me? cringe"
[0:25:01] <quantras6> Man I want to try this game again but I'm a idiot and started 2 runs of Wrath

[0:25:13] <%BinaryFireball> its the easy character with mysterious past sorta deal
[0:25:17] <%BinaryFireball> better than a jail cell
[0:25:21] <quantras6> Plus I think I lost my old save so I'd need to replay 1 as well
[0:25:39] <%BinaryFireball> personally I wish you would start in a tavern brawl though
[0:26:01] <%BinaryFireball> let you character show their character immediately through choices
[0:26:13] <Profmcstevie> Rope makes climbing easier, shocking
[0:26:14] <%Shonen_hero> I don't know man, the jail start and the beach start are reaching comparable saturation
[0:26:22] <+griffball13> it was not my fault
[0:26:35] <+HolePunchLeaf> always love a game with good ligature support
[0:26:50] <%BinaryFireball> a fun twist on jail start is about to be executed start
[0:26:57] <%BinaryFireball> which i guess is just jail start....
[0:26:59] <%BinaryFireball> damn you skyrim
[0:27:06] <Coystick> Saw her leg off, it's the only way
[0:27:10] <tigerfang86> BARRELED
[0:27:10] <%Shonen_hero> you mean the Echo? Kappa
[0:28:40] <ostermox> Wait, didn't Pat already play PoE 2?
[0:28:47] <azure_dunes> this is nice to have on while I level my crafters in ffxiv :)
[0:28:50] <%BinaryFireball> this is part 2
[0:28:59] <Coystick> You're gonna have to think about renaming that boat
[0:28:59] <%NitronStreams> yup
[0:29:02] <quantras6> @ostermox on his own time I believe.
[0:29:09] <%Shonen_hero> speaking of, DS9 is really good, go watch that
[0:29:14] <%Shonen_hero> after this of course Kappa
[0:29:16] <+griffball13> just like reggie would have done
[0:29:20] <Profmcstevie> You can't simply consume PoE 2 in one go
[0:29:32] <ostermox> @quantras6 ye, that makes sense why I remember him talking about it in a tweet or something :D
[0:29:33] <+PrinceDevian> Splode
[0:29:55] <Paperware> Ouch my head asplode
[0:30:08] <quantras6> @ostermox he posted the first part on his YouTube channel if you missed it.
[0:30:14] <+HolePunchLeaf> so this is Pat talking over prerecorded gameplay?
[0:30:26] <Profmcstevie> This is pat of the past
[0:30:30] <ostermox> @quantras6 Oh yeah, I watched it, but thanks
[0:30:31] <Profmcstevie> talking over gameplay of the past
[0:30:43] <quantras6> @holepunchleaf no it's all pre recorded, it's the strongest pat playing
[0:30:44] <+PrinceDevian> @HolePunchLeaf no.. its pat playing the game some time ago
[0:30:56] <+PrinceDevian> as a whole
[0:30:58] <quantras6> He said something about playing Sifu or something?
[0:31:10] <Profmcstevie> This is a community LP watch event
[0:31:15] <+PrinceDevian> @quantras6 Maxing out the girl
[0:31:43] <%Shonen_hero> there was supposed to be a light I guess, but he's kind of the reason your dead in the first place
[0:31:47] <+HolePunchLeaf> oh I see, probably for the best as CRPGs just inherently attract backseaters
[0:32:10] <ToneBacas> hello past Pat and current chat
[0:32:14] <quantras6> I do hope he plays Wrath of the Righteous when it's dlcs and all are done
[0:32:17] <DSD24> Oh cool today is Pillars day
[0:32:31] <%Shonen_hero> Same quantras
[0:32:32] <ape_hawk> oh god, editing
[0:32:37] <+SmiIezForMilez> I really like these streams
[0:32:37] <%SharkMissile> Editing magic! :y So unusual to see in a stream
[0:32:38] <okuriskyles> pillars 2 is one of my absolute favorite games, this makes me happy
[0:32:50] <+PrinceDevian> KoolLUL
[0:32:52] <%Shonen_hero> he probably will. He seemed to really like it, but also didn't want to go full hog until the fix polishing it up

[0:33:03] <quantras6> Oh did Pat steal the kid?
[0:33:15] <DSD24> Your mom jokes won't work on them
[0:33:19] <quantras6> I should watch his playthrough of the original pillars.
[0:33:21] <ape_hawk> FUCK YOU, DURANCE
[0:33:29] <DSD24> Durance was a big asshole
[0:33:31] <%SharkMissile> Haha, GOOD
[0:33:47] <%Shonen_hero> Durance fucking sucks. Harrim was a better Durance then Durrance
[0:33:49] <+griffball13> MY CHILD
[0:33:53] <Jonny_Uppercut> Did Pat explain why he chose to do it pre-recorded or is it just to not deal with mind goblins and spoilers in chat?
[0:33:53] <Treasure_Vault> stealing kids is cool, actually
[0:34:06] <DSD24> Even then Harrim was still kind of a dick
[0:34:12] <okuriskyles> stealing kids is fine if the alternative is the kid dies
[0:34:17] <FievelFails> I think he just wants to do something else right now
[0:34:17] <quantras6> I know it's a a choice many wouldn't have done
[0:34:25] <ape_hawk> isnt this child, like, 3 years old?
[0:34:27] <+EdgySalad> Pillar strim!
[0:34:33] <quantras6> but I wish there was more for a literal adopted child
[0:34:42] <quantras6> that you STOLE
[0:34:44] <%Shonen_hero> yeah, Harrim was a bit of a dick, but he had his more positive moments
[0:34:49] <okuriskyles> @ape_hawk it's been five years
[0:35:14] <%Shonen_hero> wait it's been five years since Pillars 2 came out?
[0:35:16] <%Shonen_hero> oh no
[0:35:18] <%Shonen_hero> oh noooo
[0:35:21] <quantras6> Harrim was alright but he's not a great high priest
[0:35:27] <DSD24> @Shonen_hero Oh yeah even if he was annoying me he wasn't all bad, Durance was like "Every thing he does pisses me off"
[0:35:31] <+griffball13> don't let it set in @Shonen_hero
[0:35:49] <DSD24> When's Pallengina tho
[0:35:50] <%NitronStreams> time is bullshit
[0:35:54] <okuriskyles> nononono, there was five years between the first game and the second game in story
[0:35:54] <KenzBurp> too late
[0:35:55] <DSD24> She's the coolest
[0:35:55] <ape_hawk> eder is the off-tank at best
[0:36:19] <DSD24> Is this Gambits from FF12?
[0:36:22] <Daxalog> Im late! Hows the pillars going
[0:36:25] <quantras6> Oh yeah didn't he make Eder a swashbuckler?
[0:36:30] <ape_hawk> yes
[0:36:37] <okuriskyles> it's only been FOUR years since pillars 2 came out :D
[0:36:54] <%Shonen_hero> @okuriskyles you're right, it's only four years since it came out instead of five
[0:36:55] <quantras6> I did like how the game gave you three options for each companion
[0:37:10] <+griffball13> for some reason I imagine pat watching this and going "Man I am so funny and good"
[0:37:18] <quantras6> so even if there was some class overlap with yours you could still make them different
[0:37:46] <%Shonen_hero> I'm sad this game didn't do so hot sales wise
[0:37:59] <%Shonen_hero> but at least we're getting that open world game
[0:38:02] <okuriskyles> same :(
[0:38:20] <Treasure_Vault> skeleton't
[0:38:25] <%Shonen_hero> I'm down for an Elder Scrolls style Pillars game
[0:38:31] <+UltraViolet371> are we about to hear confused screaming from pre-recorded paige
[0:38:34] <+griffball13> pat op
[0:38:36] <%RonaldMcDownload> fast as fuckboi?
[0:38:49] <%MooseIsGoose> hola
[0:38:55] <%NitronStreams> fast as fuckboivin
[0:39:16] <okuriskyles> i hope avowed is good, i'm a little concerned since josh sawyer isn't as involved, but it's not like one person makes or breaks the game imo
[0:40:01] <Daxalog> Whats the next CRPG going on the youtube? Wizardry?

[0:40:19] <%notsoy> yoho yoho
[0:40:28] <%Bread_Assassin> @Daxalog PAthfinder WOTR, I'd reckon.
[0:40:38] <%Shonen_hero> I'm kind of lukewarm on Josh Sawyer gonna be honest. Seems like a talented writer, but not a very pleasant person to interact with outside of that
[0:41:06] <+Double_Tap_That> This is pre-recorded, right?
[0:41:36] <+pectusumbra> that is correct
[0:41:43] <+PrinceDevian> Yes
[0:41:52] <okuriskyles> i assume no one is pleasant until i've personally met them
[0:41:52] <+theoldone001> I can't not hear Overwatch cowboy man
[0:42:23] <okuriskyles> and even then, i account for the fact that they might just be acting friendly
[0:43:00] <okuriskyles> my heart is too hard to idolize anyone anymore :(
[0:43:04] <+PrinceDevian> FailFish
[0:43:36] <%Shonen_hero> as much as Louis C.K. is like an awful human being? He was right about one thing. Never expect anything to happen
[0:43:50] <KaiserMario> Is that Pat portrait also something he got for donating like in the first game? Cause it looks just like him
[0:43:52] <%Shonen_hero> that way when something good does happen it's a nice surprise
[0:43:53] <okuriskyles> never expect good things
[0:44:04] <LiterallyPerfect> @shonen_hero where pat
[0:44:15] <LiterallyPerfect> why pat no cam
[0:44:27] <LiterallyPerfect> is this disco elysium dlc
[0:44:30] <%Shonen_hero> prerecorded footage
[0:44:32] <%HitchhikingThrough> Prerecorded patr
[0:44:34] <beefcakemanthrob> i'm sure this is pc, but i only have ps4. does the ps4 version run well?
[0:44:35] <okuriskyles> it's pre-recorded
[0:44:36] <%Shonen_hero> yes
[0:44:41] <+polothegreatest> Its HIGH NOON plaguePog
[0:44:43] <%HitchhikingThrough> Pat is audio only
[0:44:54] <LiterallyPerfect> why pre record
[0:44:55] <okuriskyles> and yes it's disco elysium dlc where you can fight and mccree is here
[0:45:01] <LiterallyPerfect> where is pat right now
[0:45:02] <okuriskyles> i mean overwatch cowboy man
[0:45:11] <%Shonen_hero> but where's Kim? BibleThump

[0:45:47] <okuriskyles> man there's really not a kim equivalent
[0:45:50] <KaiserMario> Oh this isn't live? Ah that makes sense, he doesn't sound like he's fending off chat
[0:46:03] <DSD24> Stab harder
[0:46:11] <okuriskyles> all of the main party members are, like, too not neutral to be like kim
[0:46:26] <+EdgySalad> Is this Pastrick or is it a live-live stream?
[0:46:32] <DSD24> Kim is very unique
[0:46:32] <+UltraViolet371> yeah he isn't beset by backseaters, weird
[0:46:40] <+Double_Tap_That> @EdgySalad Pastrick
[0:46:50] <BurdRightsActivist> False Pat, negative pat if you would
[0:46:52] <BurdRightsActivist> Nega-pat
[0:47:01] <DSD24> Violent Pat?
[0:47:05] <+EdgySalad> Nega-Pat!
[0:47:11] <BurdRightsActivist> Shin Pat
[0:47:22] <DSD24> Akashic Pat
[0:47:25] <DickieWoodsmall_279> I've never played this game but I'm still upset that I can't tell him how I think he should play it
[0:47:27] <+EdgySalad> Punished Pat? ... Liquid Pat?
[0:47:57] <%Shonen_hero> Kim's neutrality is to the benefit of everyone. 'cause like, he doesn't get into racial biases and is not the type to be bought to look away. His impartialness in a way makes him more moral
[0:48:24] <sirrice77> So is normal Pat just Solid Pat while Greg is his Pliskin?
[0:48:57] <DSD24> @Shonen_hero Plus it serves a nice contrast to Harry
[0:49:06] <%Shonen_hero> what you didn't realize all along, Greg, much like the gods in this game... is artificial
[0:49:13] <+EdgySalad> Please normalize calling him Solid Pat

[0:49:28] <%Shonen_hero> Pat then Gregg
[0:49:37] <Archmortal> @DSD24 It is not yet time.
[0:50:00] <quantras6> 400 people watching a pre recorded stream huh
[0:50:09] <MaronaNunya> 6 raiders from MaronaNunya have joined! 
[0:50:11] <%MooseIsGoose> Is the guy talking this gregg guy every one is talking about. if so nice of pat to give him his own show.
[0:50:17] <+UltraViolet371> 406, yes
[0:50:27] <dds333a> @mooseisgoose how nice
[0:50:33] <%bevyrage> bevyrage subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months! Aw ye pre-recorded PoE content. Thanks for strem~
[0:50:33] <DSD24> Love those crits
[0:50:39] <haitakaa> solid pat and punished venom Gief
[0:50:53] <Archmortal> sup raiding party, pasta rat is not here, this is prerecorded
[0:50:55] <%maskofmichael> @quantras6 Pat's got a high charisma stat
[0:51:01] <DSD24> Honestly I'm here because I like talking about Pillars with other people
[0:51:10] <DSD24> Plus none of my friends are into this genre
[0:51:24] <haitakaa> is this the same playthrough that's up on his Youtube?
[0:51:30] <okuriskyles> pillars is really good, pillars made me realize i might actually like western rpgs
[0:51:43] <DickieWoodsmall_279> pat left the tv on to babysit us while he runs errands
[0:51:51] <cartakus> Edard?
[0:52:08] <+EdgySalad> "errands"
[0:52:09] <%MooseIsGoose> this may sound dumb but I made Eder my mechanics guy because I took him everywhere
[0:52:10] <DSD24> Dragon Age Origins is what made me really like Western RPGs
[0:52:21] <+EdgySalad> He's pondering the orb.
[0:52:27] <DSD24> @MooseIsGoose Sounds good to me
[0:52:33] <haitakaa> kotor for me
[0:52:47] <DickieWoodsmall_279> a weird way to say he's just checking himself out in the mirror
[0:52:51] <DSD24> Kotor was really cool I hope that remake is good
[0:53:00] <okuriskyles> i liked dragon age origins but it was mostly for the story. i felt like i basically just tolerated the gameplay.
[0:53:06] <haitakaa> hot damn that new SWTOR cinematic tho
[0:53:20] <okuriskyles> caveat: i played dragon age on console
[0:53:39] <Archmortal> @haitakaa nah, that was the first game
[0:53:40] <DSD24> @okuriskyles Eyy me too! I played DA on PS3
[0:54:14] <DSD24> I will say when I played DA on PC years later I liked the combat a bit more cause of the camera that the PC has
[0:54:35] <+Bailey__Gaming> is this a pre record
[0:54:43] <DSD24> Yes it is
[0:54:46] <+Bailey__Gaming> Bailey__Gaming subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 
[0:54:47] <Archmortal> yes
[0:54:53] <%Shonen_hero> Been thinking about the gods in this game, and I remember reading a comment that because they were made they aren't really gods. And like, they have no divine mandate or whatever and weren't responsible for the cosmology of the game... but that doesn't really make them less godlike? Like, I'unno, maybe I've been read too many books about animism and shintoism. Gods are just like incredibly powerful spirits in a lot of pantheon religions, and while they have domains they don't really make shit.
[0:54:58] <sirrice77> yes, that's why it says "stared" not "stares"
[0:54:59] <Daxalog> This is reminding me of my awful build in wizardry 8 where I made 4/6 of my party members worthless cause I never thought giving melee characters the Accuracy stat (Senses)
[0:55:04] <%Bailey__Gaming> ah enjoy everybody
[0:55:10] <DickieWoodsmall_279> no he's just pretending so he doesn't have to talk to us
[0:55:20] <%Bailey__Gaming> psaBig
[0:55:36] <%NitronStreams> Mr. Boivin put a movie on for the class while he gets drunk in the teacher's lounge.
[0:55:46] <Daxalog> Hes probably making fun of us while playing with zangief.
[0:55:55] <DSD24> @Daxalog oh shit I played Wizardry 8 recently! My first playthough was pretty busted because I didn't know what I was doing
[0:56:07] <DickieWoodsmall_279> no, we're making fun of HIM while he's playing with zangief
[0:56:13] <%Seitine> Seitine subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! The optical orb grows
[0:56:14] <%HitchhikingThrough> Pat's prerecorded stuff is wild, he's so chill it feels like a different person
[0:56:25] <Daxalog> I also fell for the early game trap of getting offense spells and not buffs.
[0:56:30] <+EdgySalad> truth @dickiewoodsmall_279
[0:56:35] <okuriskyles> i absolutely love what they do with gods in this game. no spoilers for divinity 2 but that was one of my biggest gripes with that game: the gods are pretty lame lol
[0:56:48] <+PrinceDevian> @hitchhikingthrough I like it alot hope he does it more
[0:56:48] <okuriskyles> normally not a big deal but the game is called DIVINITY
[0:57:03] <DickieWoodsmall_279> he's no constantly at a heightened state of alert worrying about One Guy

[0:57:07] <sirrice77> @Shonen_hero well compared to western view of divinity, aka Christianity and such, a god not being omnipotent and omniscient is strange
[0:57:28] <DSD24> @Daxalog I managed to fix the team when I looked up enough guides, but yeah buffing way better then spells
[0:57:31] <%thedankestmeeme> is this a VOD?
[0:57:45] <DSD24> I did play Wizardry 8 cause Sseth did a video on it
[0:57:47] <%HitchhikingThrough> "Pat Stared at"
[0:57:59] <DickieWoodsmall_279> easily could be a typo
[0:58:00] <Rafikator> Litterally started playing pillars 1 cause of pat
[0:58:06] <%thedankestmeeme> Great clarifiication
[0:58:17] <Archmortal> @Shonen_hero yeah they were made powerful enough that they are indistinguishable from what people believe gods to be
[0:58:24] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Cheater
[0:58:24] <+PrinceDevian> @thedankestmeeme No pre recorded
[0:58:33] <%maskofmichael> @thedankestmeeme I believe all of his PoE2 stuff is pre-recorded, yes
[0:58:34] <DickieWoodsmall_279> ask pat if this is live
[0:58:39] <MaronaNunya> Allo KonCha I had to wait before saying hi, I didn't realize I hadn't been following until tonight before raiding
[0:58:43] <DSD24> That's the confidence kicking in
[0:59:05] <Rafikator> Hi chat, hi patron 4000
[0:59:20] <DSD24> @MaronaNunya Hello!
[0:59:36] <$realm_forge> Ever since I became a fan of Critical Role, I like to play a game in media like this called “find the Matt Mercer“
[0:59:42] <MaronaNunya> @DSD24 I hope your night is going well, if it's that time for you
[0:59:42] <DSD24> Athletics I feel is super important in these types of games
[0:59:47] <UberWolfman> Good ol Pat Stare at no cam.
[0:59:54] <okuriskyles> need to go clean up before raiding tonight, EVERYONE SHOULD PLAY PILLARS GOOD NIGHT
[1:00:09] <ape_hawk> why does pat sound like batman?
[1:00:10] <DSD24> @MaronaNunya Oh yeah its night time on my end, I appreciate the kind words!
[1:00:17] <DSD24> GUN
[1:00:37] <BigYanno> If I wanted to play pillars should I play pillars 1 first?
[1:00:48] <DSD24> Yes
[1:00:53] <MaronaNunya> @DSD24 it's night time here as well, also it's no problem at all
[1:01:29] <DSD24> Jumping into Pillars 2 without 1 is doable but pretty rough without some context
[1:01:38] <MaronaNunya> I must away from my laptop for a bit, got a few things to do, just finished up a relatively long stream and I want an energy drink lol
[1:01:46] <Daxalog> "I always wanted to be dead"
[1:01:47] <%Shonen_hero> @Shonen_hero I guess, I was certainly raised that way, but there's an entire half of the world that was never monotheistic and their religions seem cooler
[1:01:49] <+Shoosler> they're friends :)
[1:01:49] <+griffball13> pat is becoming legion
[1:01:50] <DickieWoodsmall_279> is that hammer from fable 2
[1:01:52] <MaronaNunya> I'm thinking of getting a copy of 1 at some point
[1:02:06] <%maskofmichael> Is that a [STAND]? *sarcasm*
[1:02:14] <DSD24> Hammer was the big Ginger lady in Fable 2 right?
[1:02:29] <DickieWoodsmall_279> I don't think she was ginger but yes
[1:02:35] <DickieWoodsmall_279> she was the one with the hammer
[1:03:00] <DSD24> Oh ok cool
[1:03:10] <DaCheekyOne> Is this more similar to Diablo or Divinity?
[1:03:27] <+griffball13> divinity
[1:03:40] <+UltraViolet371> I don't know anything about divinity but i'mma say divinity
[1:03:40] <quantras6> Divinity and the Pathfinder games
[1:03:58] <DaCheekyOne> Cheers gamers
[1:04:08] <+griffball13> do all worshipers of maguram look the same
[1:04:22] <+griffball13> crazy old men
[1:04:26] <%Shonen_hero> @okuriskyles yeah I hate how gods work in DIvinity 2. And they weren't always like that, either, I'm pretty sure it's a subversive look at the mythos in Divinity. I honestly like how Pathfinder does Gods, 'cause there's gods responsible for the cosmology and then gods who are just really rad dudes that became so stronk they ascended
[1:04:33] <quantras6> she's a shit "god" so she should have shitty followers
[1:05:13] <quantras6> @shonen_hero chad Cayden somehow passed a incredibly difficult trial to become a god only two other people did while drunk

[1:06:13] <%linSP> Where’s old world blues
[1:06:15] <DSD24> Iomedae in Pathfinder was a human who became a god
[1:06:25] <+UltraViolet371> is that a map of a map
[1:06:39] <sirrice77> @okuriskyles do you like Elder Scrolls gods?
[1:07:12] <quantras6> Iomeade, Cayden, Irori and some other guy were normal people who became god's in pathfinder
[1:07:39] <%chance_h> Desna best girl
[1:07:46] <quantras6> iirc Irori apparently achieved mental and physical perfection and ascended from that, the rest did a test so he says they cheated
[1:07:52] <%barrakuta371> now kith
[1:08:00] <+griffball13> KILL
[1:08:29] <%linSP> be hobo!
[1:08:50] <quantras6> hobo essence will bring you to Jesus
[1:08:56] <%chance_h> Eat the poor?
[1:09:25] <+griffball13> always steal
[1:09:48] <quantras6> YOU lift it?
[1:09:50] <%chance_h> also i hate that there is always a "I give up" option. It's usually just too boring
[1:10:00] <+griffball13> DOST THOU EVEN HOIST
[1:11:07] <DSD24> Desna is rad
[1:11:11] <%Shonen_hero> @quantras6 I always thought Iomedae didn't ascend from a test, but she was such a bro to Aeroden that she kinda became godlike over time
[1:11:15] <yukichocomilk> i've heard this song so many times in critical role
[1:11:22] <%Shonen_hero> *Aroden
[1:11:27] <+Timmaahh97> songs a banger
[1:11:32] <DSD24> Iomedae was kinda of shitty to me in Pathfinder but that's because I was being a Chaotic Azata
[1:11:33] <quantras6> I think I heard somewhere they couldn't have more party members because this system was too complicated?
[1:11:37] <%chance_h> Also is this a per-recorded stream? Pat sounds like he is in script reading mode
[1:11:47] <ape_hawk> i remember not having to have pallegina and xoti in the same party because they literally went at each others throats thanks to the rep system
[1:11:48] <TurtlesAndTentacles> is this a pre recorded stream?
[1:11:56] <+griffball13> yes
[1:12:20] <+PrinceDevian> @turtlesandtentacles pre rec0rded yes but not the stream hes playing the video live for us
[1:12:28] <quantras6> @dsd24 in Wrath? it's funny if you go Angel since you just tell her "You sacrificed your humanity to protect others, don't give me shit for doing the same"
[1:12:48] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @princedevian ahhhh! cool cool
[1:13:11] <DSD24> @quantras6 Yeah I was playing Wrath
[1:13:42] <%linSP> remember kids, ALWAYS steal from the dead
[1:13:44] <quantras6> I have three playthroughs started in it tbh because I'm a idiot
[1:13:53] <DSD24> I was Chaotic Good Azata so it really was just her yelling at me for being chaotic
[1:13:55] <+griffball13> burn the witch
[1:14:04] <quantras6> Only really advancing the Angel one though, started a Lich and Aeon as well
[1:14:13] <%IronOhki> @linSP Also, always bury valuables with your dead, so others can loot your dead. It's just courtesy.
[1:14:16] <%Shonen_hero> God I really want to go back to Wrath, but I'm waiting for March
[1:14:45] <quantras6> @dsd24 she complains about our mythic powers regardless, just more so if it's a chaotic or evil one
[1:14:48] <DSD24> I'm glad I managed to beat my Azata playthrough cause it was getting rough near the end
[1:14:50] <+griffball13> your cape is a pirate flag
[1:15:10] <%Shonen_hero> it's nice all these dead folk realized poor people needed an inheritance too
[1:15:42] <%Shonen_hero> I really want to get the secret end for Wrath man.
[1:15:44] <+griffball13> GELLARDE
[1:15:51] <Archmortal> GELLARDE
[1:16:14] <%IronOhki> Accept the light? What is this, Destiny?
[1:16:31] <quantras6> There's so much bullshit to do to get the secret ending for both pathfinders, especially wraths.
[1:17:06] <ape_hawk> ohai laura bailey
[1:17:07] <DSD24> Hey is that Kaine
[1:17:22] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Xoti the Hotty
[1:17:23] <$realm_forge> Hi Laura Bailey

[1:17:27] <DSD24> @quantras6 I looked it up and it was pretty nuts
[1:17:34] <%Shonen_hero> yeah, but like... I almost kinda understand give the stakes for that ending.
[1:17:36] <quantras6> wasn't Mars a god of war and farming?
[1:18:01] <quantras6> True, it is a pretty big thing you're trying to accomplish
[1:18:07] <%Shonen_hero> I think so yeah
[1:18:11] <quantras6> especially compared to Kingmakers
[1:18:43] <quantras6> I really need to try the expeditions games
[1:18:44] <yukichocomilk> yay it's laura
[1:18:48] <%YakumoYomi> psaElmostare
[1:19:15] <DSD24> She's a Monk right
[1:19:28] <quantras6> also is readceres just the south or something?
[1:19:29] <ape_hawk> xoti is into dads
[1:19:33] <%Shonen_hero> I did the secret ending for Kingmaker and I agree. Kingmaker is... I don't know, given all you have to do to get it, it's kind of underwhelming
[1:19:36] <Dellago> Priest, monk, or multiclass
[1:19:38] <quantras6> @dsd24 monk or priest, or multiclass
[1:19:43] <%IronOhki> Or Jody
[1:19:46] <+griffball13> holla xoti
[1:19:49] <%Shonen_hero> shit
[1:19:57] <%Shonen_hero> I totally forgot about Expeditions Rome
[1:20:05] <%Shonen_hero> I own that game and I haven't even touched it
[1:20:17] <ape_hawk> punch them with your lantern, xoti!
[1:20:32] <quantras6> I just really like the idea of a CRPG set in a historical setting
[1:21:14] <%Bread_Assassin> I know they aren't talked about as much of the proper companions, but some of the hirelings are real good. Mirke was an MVP in my first playthrough.
[1:21:35] <%Shonen_hero> I get the appeal. The expedition games are kinda neat that they are historic to an extent, but there's some magic or supernatural shit in there sometimes
[1:21:43] <Visorak6> ayy flurry
[1:21:48] <RaidenRising> ww2 crpg , you fight litch hitler
[1:21:57] <quantras6> I wish Mirke, Rekke and the vampire lady were actual companions
[1:22:12] <Dellago> Some of those hirelings were too cool to not be actual companions
[1:22:12] <%Shonen_hero> That sounds like Hellboy
[1:22:21] <ape_hawk> this time, our monk is high on christ!
[1:23:22] <quantras6> Also I saw Sawyer's next game is apparently meant to be a game similar to Disco Elysium, but you're investigating murders in 16th century Europe which sounds cool
[1:23:35] <%watts121> Did Woolie steal Pat's voice?
[1:23:36] <DSD24> Xoti has a nice design
[1:23:53] <Dellago> I swear CRPG devs are like "We made our story companions bad on purpose! As a joke!"
[1:23:56] <ape_hawk> if a monk's not fisting, they're not worth enlisting

[1:24:06] <RaidenRising> kirby eat pat , this is actually kirby patmouth
[1:24:19] <DSD24> Zen Archer is a monk who uses a bow and that's cool
[1:24:30] <DSD24> But that's on Lann who's a dork in Wrath
[1:24:47] <%chance_h> man the stealth here is much better than in the Pathfinder games.
[1:24:52] <quantras6> Lann's a dork except for council meetings
[1:24:53] <ape_hawk> stealth in this game is pretty forgiving
[1:25:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> SOUTHERN MONKS
[1:25:18] <+griffball13> #Blessed
[1:25:24] <RaidenRising> give dat echo
[1:25:24] <quantras6> Like half of Lann's suggestions in the council's in Wrath are "hang on let me get the noose"
[1:25:32] <%chance_h> Both Southern and eastern monks drink tea
[1:25:40] <%Shonen_hero> ugh I hate Lann. He's a social Darwinist
[1:26:05] <quantras6> He seems pretty chill when you first met him but he is lawful neutral I guess
[1:26:50] <%chance_h> @Shonen_hero except for when he wants to take the moral highground or get credit for doing the right thing
[1:27:04] <%Shonen_hero> yeah, I liked Lann up until you meet Regil with Lann in toe. He says some shit that really irks me big time
[1:27:20] <quantras6> also Lann is weird with a romance

[1:27:23] <DSD24> I know people don't like Wenduag but at least she's got her moments  Lann never really impressed me
[1:27:30] <%chance_h> Thats why i like to take Wenndog
[1:27:31] <ape_hawk> wait, "host"? is light a parasite?
[1:27:48] <DSD24> But Wenduag has massive moral problems if you are playing a good character
[1:28:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> Honestly I think a good villian is a social darwanist druid who is channeling the "spirit of nature" through them
[1:28:08] <ape_hawk> i keep lann around for his crits, not his critiques
[1:28:15] <%chance_h> yeah but she's hot
[1:28:23] <+allups> so she hates me :(
[1:28:31] <%Shonen_hero> lie, cheat, steal
[1:28:37] <quantras6> I liked Woljif but I did make him a Vivi instead of focusing on Eldrich scoundrel and found him more useful
[1:28:48] <MidnightPacif1c> chill except she hate you
[1:29:02] <DSD24> @chance_h Wenduag is pretty cute I agree
[1:29:10] <DSD24> Plus she has a mowhawk!
[1:29:12] <Wydamn> D:
[1:29:18] <%Shonen_hero> I like Woljif a lot. He's kind of self-interested twat, but predictable in a way
[1:29:21] <quantras6> Also since we're talking Wrath party members, Greybor was so funny to me
[1:29:49] <%chance_h> I think the mowhawk is ingame only, still nice though
[1:29:55] <quantras6> Greybor is meant to be this super skilled professional assassin and the first time I saw him was eating shit wile trying to kill a demon
[1:30:42] <DSD24> @quantras6 He's supposed to be a very effective assassin, yet he messes up a lot
[1:30:46] <%chance_h> Greybor lies on his resume to get to the interviews then talks a big game
[1:30:47] <quantras6> he comes off like a tryhard half the time
[1:31:04] <Visorak6> Until greybor hits level 16+ and starts utterly annihilating things with stat drain per his 8 swings
[1:31:13] <+griffball13> She wants that eder dick
[1:31:14] <quantras6> the most useful thing about him is some of his suggestions in council's
[1:31:28] <quantras6> getting hedge knights is worth it
[1:31:37] <%Shonen_hero> yeah it's pretty funny. That said, I can almost appreciate his attitude. Everyone is like 'shouldn't you fight demons for free?' And he's like 'no?' If you're good at something , never do it for free, especially in a holy war
[1:31:39] <+PrinceDevian> Got damn
[1:31:52] <MidnightPacif1c> coxBam
[1:32:10] <DSD24> The best party member is Regill in Wrath imo
[1:32:11] <Visorak6> tell greybor to go home and be a family man
[1:32:12] <quantras6> yeah I can appreciate the "fuck you pay me" mentality
[1:32:37] <ErikFeral> game design law 1: if a player can loot it, even if it's labelled as "steal"... they will.
[1:32:45] <%chance_h> Regill and Daerian are my favorite evil characters
[1:32:48] <DSD24> He's a breath of fresh air with his "Yeah I don't care about sad backstories you conspiring with demons? you are getting the axe"
[1:32:56] <quantras6> I liked Seelah as well
[1:33:07] <quantras6> But Regill and Daeran were the best for sure
[1:33:28] <%chance_h> Seelah is cool but spends all her money on scrolls of atonement
[1:33:42] <quantras6> Sosiel I don't find interesting that much.
[1:33:49] <%AncelDeLambert> Ember is the real BF
[1:33:52] <ape_hawk> i like the no-snitch mechanic
[1:34:06] <DSD24> Ember is nice
[1:34:07] <quantras6> Ember is weird
[1:34:07] <%Shonen_hero> I should hate Regil more then I hate Lann, since they are both pretty much social Darwinists but like.... It makes sense that Regil looks at people that way, but  when Lann goes along with it it flabbergasts me
[1:34:16] <Visorak6> Daeran was the best because his writing was peak
[1:34:24] <%chance_h> Ember is my daughter who creeps everyone out <3
[1:34:32] <Visorak6> favorite NE character depiction
[1:34:35] <quantras6> Can't say much about Camellia though since I didn't see much of her after Act 2
[1:34:38] <DSD24> Regill talking shit to demon conspirators is the best
[1:34:42] <%AncelDeLambert> @chance_h she is both of our daughter and we must protecc her
[1:34:58] <quantras6> no way I could justify a Angel of Mercy keeping Camellia around, she can hang out with my Lich
[1:35:04] <%Shonen_hero> Daeran is great. I was totally going for his cousin the queen, but that boy won me over. He's a charmer for sure

[1:35:11] <DSD24> Yeah Carmellia's interesting but yeah after the first playthrough I don't bring her much
[1:35:14] <%chance_h> @quantras6 that's a shame, she's very useful for the Lich route
[1:35:29] <%Shonen_hero> and I don't normally romance men while being a man in a lot of games
[1:35:41] <quantras6> I'll see plenty of that but when I went into that basement I killed her.
[1:35:41] <DSD24> "She's useful is she not?"
[1:36:16] <%chance_h> you can get into the basement in act 2?!
[1:36:38] <DaKnightWarrior> Pre recorded Pat is really relaxing.
[1:36:40] <quantras6> I think my favourite Daeran bit was him talking shit to the golden dragon but saying "oh yeah, a giant bug cut your girlfriends head off, you going to cry for him when we kick his ass?"
[1:36:59] <quantras6> or "Are you mean to everyone?" "Yes."
[1:37:30] <%Shonen_hero> yeah, no, it makes no sense to keep her around if you're a good guy. It borders on immoral to just let her keep doing what she does with like a warning.
[1:37:40] <%Shonen_hero> hah, that shit still makes me laugh
[1:37:41] <DSD24> The best Daeren bit to me was him talking shit to Staunton's idiot brother lamenting that we couldn't kill Staunton first so we can see the despair on his face
[1:38:02] <quantras6> That was good as well
[1:38:07] <%chance_h> lol murder hobo pat
[1:38:08] <%Shonen_hero> oh yeah, Daeran gets the best lines
[1:38:15] <gespenstkick> Stealth jank?
[1:38:21] <%chance_h> ASMR murder hobo
[1:38:22] <DSD24> Also Staunton in general sucks ass I hate that guy, even when I was trying to be super nice first playthrough
[1:38:26] <%Shonen_hero> and I agree with almost all the things he says in a lot of scenarios
[1:38:30] <quantras6> Or him being nice to Ember because there's no point being a shit when they don't realize what you're doing
[1:38:50] <+arcata_gb> immersive bird action
[1:39:17] <quantras6> I like Angel a lot but Aeon gets some really cool moments
[1:39:33] <DSD24> Azata has Aivu who's adorable
[1:39:45] <DSD24> Also my Azata Barbarian fit super well with her playstyle
[1:39:49] <%Shonen_hero> I don't like Ember, but I do appreciate Daeran's attitude toward her. It's like you said, he realizes she reads a lot of what he says quite literally, and he realizes there's no point being coy or snarky toward her
[1:40:03] <quantras6> I do wish more paths got companions instead of Lich and Azata
[1:40:04] <%chance_h> I felt bad for Staunton but the decades of service kinda make him less sympathetic/relatable
[1:40:40] <quantras6> Nurah can help you out if you use the trickster options so having her could be cool
[1:40:48] <shadoke> SkiddomaRinco Dinko Dink SikiddomaRinco doo
[1:40:49] <+necrocannibal2> FUCK WEIGHT LIMITS
[1:40:51] <quantras6> And there's a good option for Aeon as well
[1:40:55] <DSD24> Ooof Nurah I don't like her either
[1:41:01] <%Shonen_hero> god
[1:41:04] <%chance_h> all my homies hate weight limits
[1:41:04] <%Shonen_hero> weight limits
[1:41:06] <+necrocannibal2> FUCK WEIGHT LIMITS FUCK FALL DAMAGE
[1:41:07] <Visorak6> I rolled my eyes at staunton
[1:41:08] <%Shonen_hero> they are the worst
[1:41:11] <DSD24> Regill said all I needed to say about Nurah
[1:41:15] <%Shonen_hero> are there bags of holding in this game?
[1:41:45] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> "Some"
[1:42:01] <%Shonen_hero> kind of like blood magic
[1:42:07] <%Shonen_hero> which is also super fucked up
[1:42:09] <+LevelUpSlick> is the sound fucked?
[1:42:11] <+horsesaredumb> Stared?
[1:42:30] <gespenstkick> Yeah, kid, your dad sucks. Now watch me steal all your shit
[1:42:31] <%Shonen_hero> prerecorded footage
[1:42:43] <+horsesaredumb> @Shonen_hero thank you
[1:42:58] <%Shonen_hero> you're welcome Horse ^^
[1:43:06] <Treasure_Vault> I'm glad that Pat has finally admitted all his streams are prerecorded
[1:43:15] <+PopotoGaius> Is that Matt Mercer?

[1:43:36] <quantras6> man I forgot how much Xoti is into Eder
[1:43:36] <%Ne1son> @PopotoGaius Yup
[1:43:43] <ohno58> got beat by a woman
[1:43:53] <ape_hawk> she mike tyson'd the dude
[1:44:08] <quantras6> I mainly remember getting Pallegina and barely 5 minutes later her and Xoti were screaming at each other.
[1:44:43] <sirrice77> I did not get very far in pillars 2 but what do pallegina and xoti hate each other?
[1:44:50] <sirrice77> why*
[1:45:03] <%Shonen_hero> is Troy Baker in this game?
[1:45:04] <+Taisuru> Pat do you prefer Pillars or Divinity?
[1:45:06] <quantras6> Pallegina hates the gods, Xoti is a priestess of one of them
[1:45:21] <quantras6> @taisuru pre recorded
[1:45:23] <%Shonen_hero> Also, has Mercer promoted NFTs in anyway?
[1:45:35] <+Taisuru> Oh geez, okay.
[1:45:46] <DSD24> Pallegina is also a cool bird lady
[1:45:49] <DSD24> Avian Godlike
[1:45:56] <quantras6> said he was going playing Sifu or something
[1:46:01] <+PrinceDevian> @quantras6 Hes here...
[1:46:22] <~PatStaresAt> what
[1:46:30] <~PatStaresAt> did someone ask for me
[1:46:41] <~PatStaresAt> do your worksheets
[1:46:44] <%Shonen_hero> no
[1:46:50] <%MelBrooksKA> It's the fuz! Cheese it!
[1:46:55] <quantras6> Work is for nerds
[1:46:59] <%AncelDeLambert> teacher how are babies made
[1:47:06] <%Shonen_hero> get out of here PatStaresAt, I'm here for PatStaredAt
[1:47:09] <%Shonen_hero> Kappa
[1:47:19] <%chance_h> StinkyCheese for the Pat
[1:47:28] <%Agami23> mahnsion
[1:47:29] <quantras6> PatStaredAt > patstaresat
[1:47:30] <Visorak6> This is a real chill stream
[1:47:34] <%BinaryFireball> enjoy deez nutz
[1:47:37] <%AncelDeLambert> the Pat gets the cheese while the dog stares
[1:47:41] <%AncelDeLambert> Dog Stares at Cheese
[1:47:42] <+PrinceDevian> Where'd AngriestPat go whos this guy :)
[1:47:54] <%AncelDeLambert> next week we'll play the sequel: Cheese 2
[1:47:56] <Monkey_D_Judd> yeah, this is nice and chill. like it a lot.
[1:47:57] <%Agami23> this type of offline stream things are way more chill
[1:47:57] <%BinaryFireball> this is pat of christmas past
[1:48:01] <%AncelDeLambert> recheesed
[1:48:20] <+SpoopySkeletman> holy shit the character portrait looks just like pat
[1:48:20] <%HitchhikingThrough> A new pat-based anxiety: An unidentified item has been added to your inventory and you can't find it
[1:48:27] <+darkco3d> what nerd lvl do I need for this game
[1:48:34] <quantras6> am I wrong on this but I feel like I recall Pallegina was way more confrontational and bad tempered in this game?
[1:48:41] <+PrinceDevian> @Agami23 But hes not offline he started the stream then played the video for us and is in chat
[1:48:48] <%AncelDeLambert> pretty high. Not as high as Pathfinder, but pretty high
[1:48:50] <%BinaryFireball> @HitchhikingThrough  I hate how much I have that goblin
[1:48:59] <quantras6> I played at launch and got a good amount of time in but never finished it
[1:49:08] <DSD24> @quantras6 Is it mainly based on what happened to her in Pillars 1?
[1:49:16] <quantras6> I recall Pallegina got into a argument with me though and left the party.
[1:49:28] <+horsesaredumb> what is that accent
[1:49:39] <%BinaryFireball> i do like the chill lps
[1:49:40] <quantras6> @dsd24 maybe?
[1:49:44] <%HitchhikingThrough> Oh I just tuned back in and saw pat sneaking. I assume he was in enemy territory as opposed to committing crimes for fun lul
[1:49:56] <%HitchhikingThrough> *assumed
[1:50:00] <%BinaryFireball> it would be cool once he gets enough content to have PatTV 24/7
[1:50:06] <quantras6> I just remember getting her and very quickly a fight breaking out between her and Xoti, and her giving me shit a good few times.
[1:50:24] <Archmortal> Pallegina had a retcon in Pillars 2 that kind of turns her way more fanatical about the Republics

[1:50:39] <quantras6> that would explain it
[1:50:40] <Archmortal> it also ignores the Kind Wayfarers ending that Pat got in Pillars 1
[1:50:40] <%Shonen_hero> it helps everyone's not constantly jockeying for Pat's attention or backseating
[1:50:51] <+horsesaredumb> @BinaryFireball wouldnt that kill all his time caiylaBlush
[1:50:52] <quantras6> I think she was exiled in my game
[1:50:55] <%BinaryFireball> true
[1:51:07] <+darkco3d> I can't wait to lock down for eldin ring
[1:51:11] <%BinaryFireball> @horsesaredumb not if he had a big enough backlog
[1:51:23] <+PrinceDevian> @darkco3d Kreygasm
[1:51:24] <%HitchhikingThrough> Character design Located
[1:51:26] <%BinaryFireball> he just needs to keep doing it at a pace he's comfy with
[1:51:58] <Archmortal> iirc though Pallegina CAN like you a lot more if you got her personal best ending, which afaik few people did
[1:51:59] <%Shonen_hero> god there's so much shit coming out, including patches for a bunch of games I own. BG3, Cyberpunk, and No Man's Sky
[1:52:00] <+darkco3d> @princedevian I will not see light for days
[1:52:09] <quantras6> goldpacts were the guys who were really big into their contracts right?
[1:52:10] <%HitchhikingThrough> HINT HINT NUDGE NUDGE
[1:52:27] <GetMendoza> GetMendoza subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! 
[1:52:29] <quantras6> I mainly remember Bleak Walkers and thought they were cool.
[1:52:33] <%Shonen_hero> And honestly, I get shitting on Cyberpunk is the in thing to do, but I legit heard the update was good. So I'unno
[1:52:57] <+PrinceDevian> @darkco3d Any time anyone is over " You will refer to me as Elden Lord!"
[1:53:07] <quantras6> I doubt I'll touch Cyberpunk till they're done with it though.
[1:53:10] <+darkco3d> @shonen_hero did the ps4 get any fixes
[1:53:16] <Archmortal> Cyberpunk's new update is kind of just what the game should have released as to be honest.  It's probably what the dev team had as their original goal
[1:53:18] <quantras6> Or touch Warhammer for a couple of months.
[1:53:22] <%HitchhikingThrough> this fucking guy LUL
[1:53:31] <%BinaryFireball> is it worth playing now?
[1:53:37] <%BinaryFireball> im kinda over it tbh
[1:53:51] <Archmortal> if you already own it, it's worth a try with the new update.  I haven't tested it out yet, no time
[1:54:01] <%AncelDeLambert> he's a dipshit, but he's a good early crewman
[1:54:06] <+PrinceDevian> @Shonen_hero I honestly dont care they did what they did and i got my refund not gonna forgive and forget that mess lol
[1:54:15] <DSD24> I aw that Baldur's Gate 3 added Barbarians and I went "Neat is the game out yet? No? aww"
[1:54:19] <DSD24> saw
[1:54:22] <%HitchhikingThrough> god he seems useless but very funny
[1:54:37] <%Shonen_hero> *shrug* I was never hurt, didn't buy the console release, got it on PC
[1:54:37] <Archmortal> I can't wait for Baldur's Gate 3 to hit 1.0 in three years
[1:54:41] <quantras6> I think the said Baldurs Gate 3 won't be done till next year
[1:54:45] <quantras6> they*
[1:54:46] <%Shonen_hero> So I was never wronged I guess
[1:54:46] <%BinaryFireball> to me its not even about the bugs... the lack of content (that I liked) is what killed it for me
[1:54:57] <%BinaryFireball> BG3 probably is another 2 years away
[1:55:17] <%Shonen_hero> they are taking their sweet time with 3
[1:55:28] <%Shonen_hero> as they should
[1:55:29] <Archmortal> at the very least, BG3 is taking enough time that it should be one of the most polished CRPG releases ever
[1:55:32] <%BinaryFireball> i worry about it
[1:55:34] <quantras6> I just hope it doesn't end up like Divinity where the start of it is the strongest part and the rest of the game is far weaker
[1:55:41] <DSD24> I really like Barbarians so I was I was curious
[1:55:57] <%BinaryFireball> things that take a ton of time often mean problems
[1:56:02] <%Shonen_hero> when Paladin
[1:56:04] <DSD24> Cap'n
[1:56:14] <Archmortal> Baldur's Gate games both stayed pretty strong through their ends, so I kinda trust BG3 to do the same
[1:56:18] <quantras6> Yeah people said similar stuff about Cyberpunk
[1:56:33] <+horsesaredumb> LUL
[1:56:33] <DSD24> Did you guys ever play Icewind Dale? I was playing it for the first time and its pretty fun
[1:56:36] <quantras6> A long Dev time isn't always a good sign
[1:56:39] <%HitchhikingThrough> "I don't know what I expected"
[1:56:40] <KaitlynnHere> I trusted a developer once...
[1:56:41] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Nope
[1:56:43] <Archmortal> I don't know why, CDPR's games have all been messes
[1:56:45] <%BinaryFireball> icewinddale is death
[1:56:55] <%BinaryFireball> but a fun romp with friends
[1:56:59] <%Shonen_hero> yeah, I didn't like the ending for Divinity 2. There's a lot about the cosmological implications I don't like, how the last encounter/fight was scripted, how sparse the content for the last area was, etc.
[1:57:04] <%BinaryFireball> bg2 is a muuuuch better game
[1:57:08] <%Shonen_hero> I hope BG3 has a better finish
[1:57:25] <%Shonen_hero> but at this point  BG3 has taken a lot longer to develop then Divinity 2 did
[1:57:26] <+PrinceDevian> @Shonen_hero I had it on PC it on PC and it was fucked up...
[1:57:26] <@Moobot> HEY DO YOU WANT A NEW COMPUTER GO TO https://artesianbuilds.com/?aff=Patstaresat . Use the promo code PATSTARESAT to save a couple hundred dollars off your purchase!

[1:57:31] <%HitchhikingThrough> I'd sneak the key back onto her
[1:57:36] <%BinaryFireball> act 1 looked good
[1:57:36] <+PrinceDevian> ok no clue why that duplicated
[1:57:39] <%HitchhikingThrough> but I don't know if these games care about those sort of things
[1:57:45] <quantras6> Larian have strong openings but it seems like the late game doesn't hold up as well
[1:57:56] <Archmortal> also to be fair, CDPR was only really developing Cyberpunk for like... 4-ish years?  They just announced it way too early, and too much of that time was execs scrapping things and forcing restarts
[1:57:56] <quantras6> Honestly Wrath has that issue as well
[1:58:07] <Archmortal> BG3 isn't doing the latter bit of that for sure
[1:58:49] <%BinaryFireball> my main fear with bg3 is that they are going to milk it with paid content before they finish it
[1:58:57] <%BinaryFireball> probably wont happen
[1:59:06] <%BinaryFireball> but still
[1:59:12] <quantras6> I would like to see the other companions as well
[1:59:36] <quantras6> and I think people have said Minsc is going to be in it?
[1:59:37] <%Shonen_hero> I don't know, Larian never did that with their last two games
[1:59:55] <Archmortal> @HitchhikingThrough Oblivion is the only game I know of that cared about sneaking things ONTO people at all
[1:59:58] <%Shonen_hero> which doesn't mean squat if it's a licensed property and someone else is footing the bill
[2:00:05] <%BinaryFireball> yea thats why I doubt it but for some reason im paranoid with it
[2:00:25] <%BinaryFireball> it smells funny to me atm
[2:00:52] <Archmortal> it's been the same buy early play early deal since it went up which was... quite a while ago now.  I think we're safe
[2:01:15] <%Shonen_hero> That's fair, I'd be a little worried about it, especially given what I've been hearing about WotC's parent company Hasbro interested in getting into the NFT market
[2:01:19] <%Shonen_hero> which bleugh
[2:01:19] <%BinaryFireball> until their cash runs out
[2:01:50] <DSD24> See his way on death got it
[2:02:34] <%BinaryFireball> so the best thing about nfts is that there arent enough engineers who know how to implement it and then of the ones who do only half of them probably want to
[2:02:41] <quantras6> while I'm not a big graphics guy Deadfire is a really pretty game for a CRPG
[2:03:23] <Archmortal> all of the engineers already know how to implement them.  It just sucks and is completely nonviable for literally anything except as an energy-guzzling authentication method
[2:03:48] <%BinaryFireball> not the ones i know lol :P
[2:03:50] <ape_hawk> hehehehehehe
[2:03:58] <%Shonen_hero> Most game developers worth their salt realize how difficult it would be to introduce NFTs into a lot of preexisting game engines, and also the idea that NFTs would somehow can be taken and implemented from game to game
[2:03:58] <+PrinceDevian> Wait did pat steal it?
[2:04:02] <quantras6> haha who would do that haha
[2:04:03] <%Shonen_hero> a laughable prospect
[2:04:06] <ape_hawk> "how much beer can i buy with this stupid eye?"
[2:04:13] <azure_dunes> @PrinceDevian he sure did
[2:04:25] <+PrinceDevian> NotLikeThis
[2:04:25] <quantras6> I think some of the expedition developers left to go and make NFT games
[2:04:31] <%BinaryFireball> what I think is gonna happen is that there is going to be an NFT company that will shill their services to the big boys
[2:04:33] <%chance_h> it's usually just cheaper and easier to just invest in better security and computers than it is to impliment and maintain a blockchain
[2:05:08] <Archmortal> can't wait to watch Ubisoft crash and burn.  Their darling NFT market is gonna be attached to a game no one cares about because they can't get enough people back to work to make new games
[2:05:13] <%Bread_Assassin> I really wish that both POEs let you level up and equip everyone if you were in you castle or on you ship.
[2:05:29] <%croxeye> stealing the beggars coin XD
[2:05:36] <%BinaryFireball> fuck if they put NFTs into the next might and magic i will cry
[2:05:36] <Archmortal> yeah, Pathfinder letting you do that was amazing
[2:05:43] <Treasure_Vault> The only blockchain i care about are people fighting with chains tied to cinderblocks, like the founding fathers intended
[2:05:56] <ToneBacas> @BinaryFireball or the Splinter Cell remake
[2:06:02] <%BinaryFireball> here here @Treasure_Vault
[2:06:03] <+PrinceDevian> @Treasure_Vault LUL
[2:06:07] <Archmortal> I like blockchains on Twitter that block everyone following nazi accounts
[2:06:21] <%BinaryFireball> I'll be real I always wanted to like Sam Fisher but he was never snake

[2:06:36] <Archmortal> (the overlap with NFT/crypto is as high as you'd expect)
[2:06:37] <sirrice77> @Treasure_Vault is....is that where stonemasons come in?
[2:06:45] <%Shonen_hero> I hope Owlcat never touches NFTs. I really like Owlcat and they seem on the up and up
[2:07:13] <%BinaryFireball> free masons were a group of coked out sailors
[2:07:24] <quantras6> I did hear they talked about a 2nd season pass for Wrath
[2:07:30] <%BinaryFireball> makes sense to me
[2:07:41] <quantras6> which I'd like to see since only one of the dlcs really interested me
[2:07:52] <Archmortal> yo so am I the only person that likes the ending of Kingmaker wayyyyyyyy the hell more than Pat did
[2:07:59] <Archmortal> rather, the "secret" ending
[2:08:07] <%Shonen_hero> I mean, that's fine by me tbh, so long as it's not like nickel and dime approach to DLCs like Paradox.
[2:08:07] <%BinaryFireball> probably not lol
[2:08:09] <quantras6> ones a big dungeon for the main game and a roguelike mode
[2:08:22] <%Shonen_hero> Fuck Paradox's DLC model
[2:08:25] <%Shonen_hero> it's asinine
[2:08:29] <DSD24> You saucy boy
[2:08:32] <%YakumoYomi> Stabby Stabby
[2:08:33] <%Shonen_hero> and so is Creative Aseembly's
[2:08:35] <+darkco3d> fuk him up
[2:08:37] <DSD24> "What you Egg?"
[2:08:37] <quantras6> another is short campaign with a much lower level character during the games intro
[2:08:39] <%BinaryFireball> I get why people don't like paradox's approach but by god do they release a ton of content
[2:08:53] <%BinaryFireball> at least with CK
[2:09:08] <Archmortal> nothing will ever approach Destiny's model of deleting the only things anyone ever liked about the game
[2:09:19] <%Shonen_hero> I think Pat liked the ending slides to Kingmaker, just not the end content
[2:09:37] <Archmortal> yeah that's kinda what I meant
[2:09:53] <%BinaryFireball> yea destiny... i dont know what they're thinking really
[2:09:58] <teefpal> @Archmortal The most insane model of DLC ever.  Can't believe that didn't permanently sink the whole company
[2:10:02] <quantras6> I do hope he is willing to do a series on Wrath.
[2:10:05] <%Shonen_hero> House At The Edge of Time kinda sucks, even if you have no issues using consumables and you use mercenaries instead of the prebuilt NPCs
[2:10:23] <quantras6> Yeah the House is awful
[2:10:44] <quantras6> After the first time I just turn the game to story mode then and rush through it
[2:10:51] <Archmortal> I honestly enjoyed it a lot.  But I also like attrition style stuff in tabletop during climaxes like that anyway
[2:10:52] <Visorak6> House was a slog
[2:11:34] <quantras6> in a tabletop it might be fine but in the game I found it a chore
[2:12:52] <DSD24> This stream is very comfy
[2:12:54] <Archmortal> @Archmortal honestly it still might.  The shit they deleted before wasn't exactly well-loved.  This round of deletions is literally every piece of content that was universally loved
[2:13:13] <+horsesaredumb> is the snoring Zangief or in game>
[2:13:35] <DSD24> Wow I hate it
[2:13:36] <nephets_stein> I wanna see doggy
[2:13:41] <DSD24> Silver Helm on Gold Armor
[2:13:47] <%IronOhki> @DSD24 Oddly, yeah. Agree.
[2:14:07] <quantras6> Did he ever stream Tyranny?
[2:14:13] <%IronOhki> Not used to this kind of chill from Mr. Pat, but I'm here for it.
[2:14:28] <DSD24> @IronOhki For me anyway Pat is playing very differently from how I played Pillars so its a chill vibe plus its interesting
[2:14:30] <quantras6> Tyranny is a game I really liked but god it makes me sad with how blatantly unfinished it is
[2:14:41] <Archmortal> was Evil Within the first time we saw chill vod pat?
[2:14:50] <DSD24> I was a massive goody goody in Pillars because a lot of people are just jerks
[2:14:50] <Treasure_Vault> Can any Divinity OS 2 fans tell me if they ever fixed the part on the second island where everyone just stops playing the game?
[2:15:32] <ape_hawk> Pat Steals At
[2:15:37] <DSD24> Uhhh I got to the 3rd island and stopped playing so I'm not sure if I can add anything
[2:15:45] <Archmortal> Pat Stole At

[2:15:56] <%GalacticaPhanto> @archmortal I feel that it was Silent Hill 2 where we got super chill Pat
[2:16:32] <quantras6> I remember liking this guy
[2:17:03] <teefpal> I've tried playing through Tyranny, Numenera, PoE1 and 2, Divinity Original Sin 1 and 2, and both Pathfinders.    Tyranny and Numenara were the only one's I finished
[2:17:11] <Archmortal> yeah for a whole playthrough SH2 was very comfy for him, but I mean like, Evil Within had an episode or two of just this style where he had to replay after crashes
[2:17:22] <sirrice77> @Treasure_Vault i mean i completed the game so uh idk? If it helps i played lone wolf which means you team up with one companion who will also take lone wolf and you're both super powerful. I think that got nerfed though
[2:18:02] <DSD24> I need to finish Tyranny
[2:18:10] <quantras6> Odd to try the "I'm the lord of a castle though" when your castle got wrecked
[2:18:16] <DSD24> I was on the Anarchy Path and it was pretty cool
[2:18:22] <teefpal> PoE 1 and Divinity 1 were boring as fuck, and I bounced hard off of PoE 2
[2:18:28] <quantras6> @dsd24 it's not that long anyway so you may as well
[2:18:43] <quantras6> I went anarchy as well for a number of reasons
[2:18:50] <DSD24> I did like the party members in Tyranny
[2:19:02] <DSD24> What was the bandit lady Verse? she was cool
[2:19:08] <teefpal> Both Pathfinders I got more than halfway through though, I should finish WoTR at least, that one was really good
[2:19:15] <Archmortal> PoE1's main plot really does kinda take too long to ramp up to the promise of its setting
[2:19:39] <teefpal> Tyranny is excellent, but there's no conclusion and now there never will be, loved the characters and world
[2:19:42] <quantras6> I threw the chorus at the walls because I hoped more of them would die, Barik the tank left and I was so annoyed from taking the fort I attacked the smug chorus guy who came in after the boss
[2:20:09] <quantras6> I ended up going solo because I was so sick of the bullshit of both armies
[2:20:19] <DSD24> Scarlet Chorus were a bunch of jackasses
[2:20:34] <Archmortal> when in doubt always go back to Planescape: Torment.  Even if its combat for the first few hours is ass its writing is still the best
[2:20:39] <quantras6> I also missed the part that who takes the place owns it
[2:20:49] <zerointelligence000> is this pre-recorded?
[2:20:53] <%AncelDeLambert> shut UP girl
[2:20:56] <DSD24> Yes
[2:21:04] <%AncelDeLambert> yes, this series is all pre-recorded
[2:21:10] <teefpal> pick your poison, borderland psychos or genociders
[2:21:17] <quantras6> but I mainly sent the chorus because I hoped they would have massive casualties, because who wants a roaming band of bloodthirsty idiots after in peace
[2:21:24] <teefpal> @Archmortal Turth
[2:22:16] <%MelBrooksKA> Gellarde spyPraise
[2:22:30] <quantras6> I did get Tunon and Mark on board which was neat
[2:22:52] <Archmortal> GELLARDE
[2:23:35] <Archmortal> in hindsight, I'm shocked there isn't a Gellarde emote commemorating how much he loved Pallegina's chatter in Caed Nua early in the channel's life
[2:23:49] <DSD24> Alchemy was great in Morrowind
[2:24:05] <quantras6> Alchemy is something I want to use in games but never actually use
[2:24:14] <quantras6> Like I rarely use it in Skyrim
[2:24:34] <Archmortal> @quantras6 same, I used it in skyrim for enchant exploitation, but I never use it for its intended purpose
[2:24:41] <quantras6> I like to be the crafter guy when I can
[2:24:42] <%Shonen_hero> you know, I've owned Tyranny for quite some time now, and I haven't touched it
[2:24:57] <Gragnack> Tyranny is solid
[2:24:59] <Archmortal> that said, doing Triple Crown Solo PoE1 makes potion-making significantly important
[2:25:02] <zerointelligence000> PirATe
[2:25:11] <quantras6> like making weapons or using stuff like the reload bench in New Vegas
[2:25:32] <%Shonen_hero> I bought it I guess to help support the genre as a whole, because for like a decade and a half CRPGs kind were dead? So I was super scared of the business model failing, so I bought a lot of them, even ones I wasn't sure I'd play
[2:25:57] <quantras6> I want to try Age of Decadence as well
[2:26:13] <quantras6> And I'm curious to see that devs next game because god the setting sounds depressing
[2:26:24] <%Shonen_hero> I like Age of Decadence's lore, not sure how I feel about it mechanically though
[2:26:48] <%Shonen_hero> it's very depressing
[2:26:55] <+horsesaredumb> ew dont call it a session
[2:26:55] <quantras6> The idea of a RPG in a generation ship sounds so depressing and dark to me
[2:26:55] <%IronOhki> Bye Pat!
[2:26:56] <%pokefan9956> @PatStaresAt raid?
