Shit gets so insane late game WoTR that you're respecing your entire party before every fight for even a chance in hell on normal.  Absolutely unreal sometimes.

[0:40:03] <%BogBodyPositive> @bigfingerro agreed
[0:40:05] <BigFingerRo> @BogBodyPositive and a LOT of people died too
[0:40:07] <%ConLin_Arts_> oh he gwumpy
[0:40:07] <%CatastropheCorvid> ThemotherfuckingKENSAI
[0:40:09] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @The_Angry_God_Hoogs OH FUCK OFF.
[0:40:12] <%Zebroneath> Inquisitor
[0:40:14] <%luftraumm1> ugh 2.0 is such bullshit lol
[0:40:15] <%Mr_Pylon> The question is, what's the best weapon and what class is it locked to.
[0:40:20] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @The_Angry_God_Hoogs That's fucked, I'm sorry.
[0:40:28] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat it's so dumb out here that Portland, Maine voted to end State of Emergency Monday (which required hazard pay to workers) like its all over. While they are having the city meeting over Zoom!
[0:40:35] <%Visorak6> The problem with Pathfinder is there's tons of soup builds that use feats from all over the universe and if those feats arent in the game the builds dont work.
[0:40:42] <Charuzu> Solo Tactics
[0:40:48] <%Bt_Robot> Best player class is Mage/Kensai
[0:40:48] <%CatastropheCorvid> Kensai though
[0:40:50] <Laecerelius> Hope your BG2 Paladin uses greatswords for that sweet, sweet Holy Avenger
[0:40:55] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Not correct, its Kensai Multiclassed thief
[0:40:56] <%BinaryFireball> BG2 is great but also totally flawed
[0:41:06] <%justcallmebobplease> KENSAI / MAGE FOREVER
[0:41:12] <%AncelDeLambert> I tried to play BG2 with a wizard... that was a mistake
[0:41:17] <$The_Angry_God_Hoogs> @pocketbearillustrator Thanks
[0:41:19] <%king_wragles> The last one is personal preference unless you want to meta your meta
[0:41:20] <BigFingerRo> @JoshManVGH gotta pander to the crazies! a city of dead people is still a city with voters
[0:41:21] <%BinaryFireball> one would hope the modern kingmaker games test out all the basline builds
[0:41:26] <+Draegen_> Gief summoning an eldritch horror in the corner from the sounds of it LOL

[0:42:00] <1matheuw> yeah thats a bumber
[0:42:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> LUL
[0:42:04] <1matheuw> bumer*
[0:42:12] <%Visorak6> Or on high difficulty
[0:42:14] <moonmintparadise> I hate how convoluted the 5E D&D Rules are, like building a character in Baldurs Gate 3 is bad enough but jesus Pathfinder and Kingmaker took the cake of "WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING?"
[0:42:17] <%SinnerEbru> this is why i like playimg rpg's on piss baby mode
[0:42:18] <%BogBodyPositive> bumber
[0:42:19] <%Nekros4442> there free rerolls in pathfinder at least. At least wotr
[0:42:19] <%shruke> this is the reason I play easy on these games. In person DnD the DM creates encounters around your party, it's not fixed
[0:42:20] <ExpressNode> I'm in the mood for playing a game but for some reason can't play one after being exhausted. It sucks
[0:42:21] <@Ranryu692> no respec no buy
[0:42:27] <%Tyrimat> High difficulty could fuck you though
[0:42:29] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @The_Angry_God_Hoogs Keep yourself safe, however you can. Hope you aren't being harassed over the mask mandate.
[0:42:35] <+Lulu19> vtmbl
[0:42:37] <%Mr_Pylon> NWN2 has a super cool weapon that can turn into any sword EXCEPT RAPIER. That sucked to get to 20 hrs in.
[0:42:39] <%JoshManVGH> Neat!
[0:42:39] <1matheuw> you can probably change your main weapon
[0:42:40] <%notsoy> thank god the PF games have respecs lol
[0:42:48] <%cherryburnout> hey pat are you streaming MH Rise PC?
[0:42:53] <%StephanieSadGirl> Honestly, for me, Disco Elysium made all of those games, like baldurs gate, significantly worse in comparison.  The isometric rpgs combat is just not fun for me and the dialogue is so lacking compared to disco
[0:42:58] <moonmintparadise> What the fuck is even the difference between a Spear and a Trident? Its the same fucking weapon why can't I use one of them?
[0:43:00] <tape_player> make sure to ask your DM what good weapons he'll have come up before making yoru character

[0:43:31] <Enthaarungscreme> that was from 2017
[0:43:34] <%SinnerEbru> horrific, thanks
[0:43:34] <Treasure_Vault> Wasn't it a video from SXSW 2017 or something?
[0:43:39] <%BinaryFireball> that was from 2017 if I recall, the VR looked so jank in that
[0:43:42] <T_Sasquatch> Shopping for groceries IN the meta verse ??
[0:43:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> anything real*
[0:43:44] <%king_wragles> @Valdorick for a while now, yes
[0:43:46] <%CatastropheCorvid> @Valdorick You thought we weren't?
[0:43:50] <@Ranryu692> As a grocery store worker, I kind of like the idea of no customers in the actual store

[0:43:56] <Profmcstevie> That Matrix scene with the guns...but milk

[0:44:05] <%MelBrooksKA> @Valdorick The worst one yes
[0:44:05] <moonmintparadise> Imagine harrassing someone in the meta verse now lmao
[0:44:06] <+redthebaron> instead of using a website a thing we invented already

[0:46:37] <huskarl_zap> also it implies forever lockdowns will be law aswell
[0:46:38] <%Sirakou> Its like someone watched Ready Player One and thought it was a good idea
[0:46:44] <cinless> metaverse is a second shot at creating the metaverse from the 1992 novel Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson, the first being Second Life. Second Life was way more successful than this new metaverse ever will be, and Second Life sucks shit

[0:46:55] <Shwepie> Metaverse is someone reading the dystopia of Ready Player One and going, "Yes, more of that!"
[0:46:56] <%CatastropheCorvid> WELCOME TO OCULUS.
[0:46:57] <Brapula_> I don't like shopping for groceries enough as is, I'm not gonna do it for fake
[0:46:59] <%RD_NX> it's made for people like my grandmother who spend every minute of the day on facebook and doesn't work. Only she can't use a phone that doesn't have buttons.

[0:59:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> oof
[0:59:59] <GreatLordButterbean> Holy shit I didn’t know a dog could make those noises
[1:00:01] <tranquilturnip> its true but its good tho
[1:00:02] <+Mrbaconator> YEAH IT'S GREAT
[1:00:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> JESUS
[1:00:08] <%RealThiele> LUL no
[1:00:09] <+BigCoffee> If he talking about the games or the pen and paper?
[1:00:10] <Zombrocom> That's... quite a bit of an exageration tbh
[1:00:11] <sungiant_> kinda
[1:00:13] <tranquilturnip> its both but its good
[1:00:14] <+Mrbaconator> Also true
[1:00:15] <akitanito> in a sense yes
[1:00:15] <+Kyma1020> It's really made by people that liked 3.5 and 4.0 not being great
[1:00:15] <%Visorak6> That's way hyperbole on the WOTR bit
[1:00:16] <%cooldude69xx> You are correct pat
[1:00:17] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that sounds horrid
[1:00:17] <+FoolsArcade> no it was 3e
[1:00:18] <%JoshManVGH> Yes and no
[1:00:18] <Lixagon> also true
[1:00:19] <SamHellbent> Thats true as well
[1:00:19] <+redthebaron> also that
[1:00:20] <+Kyma1020> yeah
[1:00:20] <%MaddyCaddy> That's what I heard
[1:00:20] <sungiant_> it was a part of it
[1:00:22] <%Tyrimat> Yeah they said hey we like this were going to take it and iterate
[1:00:24] <%VioletHeart> 4.0 is cool but VERY different from 3.5. Pathfinder was an attempt to continue to make  content for 3.5.
[1:00:25] <+pectusumbra> That's more what I thought
[1:00:25] <TheFramedWarlock> It is also that
[1:00:25] <+Catpurnicus> it started before that
[1:00:26] <%JoshManVGH> 3.5 was also not garbage enough
[1:00:28] <+BigCoffee> Pathfinder is DnD 3.75 in repsonse to DnD 4 sucking ass
[1:00:28] <Profmcstevie> Both
[1:00:29] <%RealThiele> yep
[1:00:29] <Zeif00> bit here a bit there
[1:00:29] <%bassoontyphoon> i thought it was both
[1:00:30] <+BoocherOnTwitch> that is correct,  though 4e is good but it's a very different game
[1:00:30] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt It still amazes me how big Zangief's final form is compared to Lvl1 Gief when you got him. He like octupled in size
[1:00:31] <%RD_NX> i thought it came before 4, and it was a sort of 3.5
[1:00:32] <+Catpurnicus> it came from 3.5 being unplayable
[1:00:32] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:00:32] <%StephanieSadGirl> Pat, you would probably like 4.0 dnd, it was designed to play like a MMORPG
[1:00:33] <+Vigonept> nah tryhsrds
[1:00:33] <ElSuperNova> Thats what I thought yeah
[1:00:34] <%cooldude69xx> @FoolsArcade What? no
[1:00:35] <%iErik4> iErik4 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[1:00:36] <%IamGrapes> yeah 4e wasnt great so some dudes made Pathfinder
[1:00:37] <moonmintparadise> both
[1:00:38] <sungiant_> they said we like 3.5 so they make 3.5 2
[1:00:38] <cinless> D&D 4th edition is fine, but pathfinder nerds liked 3.x
[1:00:41] <+Mrbaconator> 4th ED is hot garbage
[1:00:42] <%Mr_Pylon> It was people hating on 4 going more mmoish
[1:00:45] <tpc28> feetfeetTongue1 feetfeetTongue2 feetfeetTongue3
[1:00:51] <%DeadStage> 3.5 was great
[1:00:51] <+pectusumbra> basically DnD 4 went fully video gamey while pathfinder iterated / extended 3.5
[1:00:52] <tanarath> Kinda? 3e sucked 4e did its best bust wasn't what everyone wanted.
[1:00:54] <T_Sasquatch> Hm
[1:00:54] <akitanito> scurred gief
[1:00:56] <+ThunderJim> What kinda LG tv you got
[1:01:01] <%StephanieSadGirl> @tpc28 sipsipGasm
[1:01:02] <+Catpurnicus> 4.0 let fighters do more than one thing per round and heal occasionally, so it had to go
[1:01:02] <%luftraumm1> its basically what if 3.5 wasn't min maxy enough
[1:01:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> he wants to eat the wipes
[1:01:15] <ScreamLord> Sustenance
[1:01:17] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> how come the dog is making sheep noises
[1:01:20] <tpc28> @stephaniesadgirl feetfeetThighs
[1:01:22] <sungiant_> pathfinder 2 fighters are gods though
[1:01:30] <+polothegreatest> OhMyDog
[1:01:31] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Zangief sounds like he wants to pop his V Trigger
[1:01:31] <T_Sasquatch> Man those noises
[1:01:33] <%missingangle> What kind of alien noise did he just make??
[1:01:34] <spongeofmystery> Gief making noises like a Subnautica creature
[1:01:34] <%JoshManVGH> I appreciate that Gief now also chats during the intro.
[1:01:35] <%tank7013> He's really staring something down there
[1:01:37] <Tracazoid> LUL
[1:01:38] <+Draegen_> that dog demands treats lol
[1:01:39] <%SinnerEbru> what is UP with gief tonight
[1:01:41] <Shardlab> 4E broke caster supremacy, so it was rejected after 3.5
[1:01:42] <+Catpurnicus> D&D fighters are like O'Brien in DS9, they must suffer

[1:05:43] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt As you level up, not only do you get a bunch more spell slots but buffs also last ludicrously long times

[1:06:55] <sungiant_> pretty much just qol stuff, no bigly things
[1:07:13] <+BigCoffee> but BG2 is also 2nd ed
[1:07:17] <Fabpsi_> Zangief would be perfect for zombie-sounds
[1:07:26] <+BigCoffee> they didnt want resting to be op
[1:07:32] <Zombrocom> Yeah pretty much
[1:07:34] <%Visorak6> As you get higher level buffs last 20~ mins
[1:07:34] <%AyotoCorp> Your pre-fight buffs can last for a while usually
[1:07:35] <+BigCoffee> yes
[1:07:37] <KaiserMario> you are buffing
[1:07:38] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt Most buffs last 1 minute/level
[1:07:40] <%AyotoCorp> Two or three pre-buffs per dungeon
[1:07:41] <%ValHollaYoloson> ValHollaYoloson subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[1:07:42] <%shruke> Before big fights usually
[1:07:47] <freelancer_jack> Buffs scale with your level
[1:07:49] <Zombrocom> Most buffs last 5 - 10 minutes so you can just run a dungeon with their duration
[1:07:50] <+Vigonept> till the timer godd fosn
[1:07:54] <sungiant_> anything that lasts over 10mins is basically a full dungeon cast
[1:07:55] <freelancer_jack> So your bard will always be useful
[1:07:57] <%AgniBrandt> And that's caster level, not spell slot level
[1:08:04] <DeltaPangaea> Legit, being able to rest whenever you want is a cause of a load of balance fuckery in the tabletop.
[1:08:09] <Zombrocom> Some buffs like haste are shorter but you can just recast them per fight
[1:08:10] <draca23> Depends on encounter
[1:08:17] <%notsoy> it gets even more manageable in wrath, since you can potentially make any buff last for an entire in-game day
[1:08:19] <Zombrocom> Most buffs last 1 minute per character level
[1:08:21] <sungiant_> it gets higher, but theres more spells to cast
[1:08:23] <%shruke> pathfinder wanted difficulty to be from multiple encounters and resource management, rather than giant encounters. I believe
[1:08:27] <%BinaryFireball> lol
[1:08:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WOW
[1:08:37] <%greasypete00> lol
[1:08:43] <%BinaryFireball> isnt that just straight up malware at that point?
[1:08:43] <Laecerelius> What the fuck
[1:08:46] <%missingangle> Thank god I haven't used Norton in years
[1:08:50] <Verdantree> That seems super uncool
[1:08:51] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Why would someone have Norton 360 anyway?
[1:08:55] <jtsoppy137> big scams
[1:08:56] <+PrimalDweeb> Just straight up theft
[1:08:56] <%TheWinged7> yarp, norton is now even more of malware than it laready was

[1:09:01] <+redthebaron> that seems big illegal
[1:09:02] <draca23> I should remake my Dark Knight build. Teleport, drain health, and launch a fucking fireball to kill three enemies was fun lol.
[1:09:04] <%Jeemukun> from what I've heard it doesn't start mining until you opt into it, but it's still real shitty

[1:10:07] <akitanito> wow
[1:10:08] <slipdog> grandma community is reeling from this
[1:10:11] <sungiant_> malware with a different name
[1:10:11] <+PrimalDweeb> Crypto is a virus that won't go away, like NFTs; and a certain something else...
[1:10:15] <%notsoy> get a class action lawsuit for that shit
[1:10:17] <Profmcstevie> Give me your PC, it is mine now

[1:10:33] <+TEANTACLES> wait what program is this that pat's talking about?
[1:10:37] <%tank7013> NFT weirdos always act like turning a game asset into an NFT suddenly means you can like... take it with you. Like you can take your Pepe the Frog sword and just insert it into another game
[1:10:39] <%psidefx> Well Norton just gives you Malware now... how far we've come
[1:10:49] <Calek> @TEANTACLES Norton anti virus

[1:11:39] <DeltaPangaea> @tank7013 Because they drastically fail to comprehend the investment required and how little information an NFT itself actually contains.
[1:11:44] <%BinaryFireball> so why were people mad about the undercutting in ff14???

[1:12:34] <Fabpsi_> more peepo coming?
[1:12:35] <DeltaPangaea> "You're not allowed to undercut me" says man who does not understand how a market works.
[1:12:40] <Shwepie> @tank7013 I mean, if all games use the same blockchain, maybe? That'll never happen though and the only benefit a blockchain could bring to a game already exists in games.
[1:12:47] <%Nordguy> @binaryfireball cuz undercutting is shit. it's the expsc with the biggest glut of newcomers so it's expected

[1:14:14] <%RealThiele> da supply and demand
[1:14:14] <%Agami23> i saw someone trying to undercut me and i bought their items and sold them at a higher price
[1:14:26] <Fabpsi_> I bet he has multiple power point presentations just for this, I would love to see Pat talking economics
[1:14:26] <+IxDomxI> @Nordguy that doesnt work, the value of them actively drops as more people get savage gear/tomestone gear
[1:14:29] <%BinaryFireball> @ElSuperNova no they would not haha
[1:14:49] <jtsoppy137> KICK DOWN TO 1 Gil
[1:14:49] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Is this about ff14?

[1:14:58] <%RealThiele> 1 dollar, bob
[1:15:00] <Fabpsi_> yes Plaid
[1:15:01] <%BinaryFireball> the price will stabilize though
[1:15:04] <Fabpsi_> well, not only
[1:15:04] <$StrawberryPantsu> FUCK EM
[1:15:05] <Zedkan> then you reset the market
[1:15:09] <Zedkan> basic goblining
[1:15:11] <+FennecZephyr> Bruh just put it up at the previous price minus a single gil
[1:15:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> LUL
[1:15:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> HELL YEAH LUL
[1:15:18] <+Mrbaconator> sounds like a buyers market

[1:15:20] <%AlteisenReiseZ> WHAT IDIOTS
[1:15:21] <%Valdorick> What large market place is going to buy at 10M though?
[1:15:24] <Profmcstevie> Sold to no one online
[1:15:25] <2meito> @FennecZephyr frfr
[1:15:25] <T_Sasquatch> No one is paying fucking 10 million
[1:15:25] <yukichocomilk> @FennecZephyr yeah it's so simple
[1:15:27] <%BinaryFireball> then no one would buy it
[1:15:28] <tatsu_akechi> that is why item need a BASE price
[1:15:28] <%captain_thickthighs> @patstaresat so the price is right rules
[1:15:32] <+BigCoffee> buyer's market
[1:15:33] <Fabpsi_> But multiple people are scared on the internet and want to sell
[1:15:34] <%Visorak6> Thats when you buy it all and put it back up at 10m @PatStaresAt
[1:15:35] <2meito> alright, that's fucked up
[1:15:35] <spongeofmystery> Isn't that the plot of the movie Trading Places
[1:15:36] <%CalderGaming> suck it capitalists
[1:15:37] <%DEETRz> yeah they are
[1:15:39] <%RealThiele> yea HQ 580 gear is like 300-500k
[1:15:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> do they not teach economics in school anymore?
[1:15:43] <%Tyrimat> Thats a fucking lie
[1:15:43] <Dead_Trickster> When people don't know how to play the Market Board it turns into a buyers market.
[1:15:44] <akitanito> check the history
[1:15:45] <%captain_thickthighs> wait s
[1:15:46] <%BinaryFireball> Pat this sounds like FF14 NFT bullshit
[1:15:49] <2meito> if it was just that one dude, the market would be fine, but people keep undercutting
[1:15:53] <%BinaryFireball> same idea
[1:15:56] <%BinaryFireball> get in early
[1:15:56] <%Tyrimat> World prog is INTENSE
[1:15:57] <+BigCoffee> I made 4 million reselling rank 9 materia

[1:16:05] <Lupinzee> if we just collective fix the market KEKW
[1:16:05] <Calek> @BinaryFireball bruh
[1:16:06] <%captain_thickthighs> how much time does it take to make these items
[1:16:06] <%mongorific> Based Pat says fuck Laissez Faire Economics
[1:16:13] <%Valdorick> But 10M isn't SUSTAINABLE. A Sucker is born everyday, but consistent money is more than waiting for a whale...... wait... *shit you're right.*
[1:16:15] <%BinaryFireball> hahaha
[1:16:15] <Gray_LoFi> Why don't people just undercut by 1 gil each time, who halves the dang price
[1:16:16] <draca23> THey don't know house makers...
[1:16:17] <%SinnerEbru> mmo economics are always fascinating

[1:16:20] <Zeif00> There are MANY multimillionaire raiders in FFXIV
[1:16:23] <+redthebaron> oh baby
[1:16:24] <Fabpsi_> There was in Warframe that one mod, I don't know the name, which got mad real-money-currency prices because it was "exklusive". Then DE decided to make the mod available again and the price dropped like hell
[1:16:24] <+redthebaron> wow
[1:16:32] <%Valdorick> Just go whale fishing!
[1:16:32] <2meito> but hoenstly, how fast do you think they'll buy them up?
[1:16:33] <Reveresao> GOOD
[1:16:36] <%BinaryFireball> the market is there to offer convenience
[1:16:38] <%captain_thickthighs> this sound like crypto bro stuff
[1:16:40] <+Vigonept> SSLF SUSTAINING ECONOMY
[1:16:40] <2meito> cause it might be a good idea to buy some and sell it later

[1:16:50] <%RealThiele> this is the crafters savage content
[1:16:50] <Fabpsi_> So yea, if people wait and sit on their price, they can do it. But undercutting is always....meh..stupid
[1:16:50] <%captain_thickthighs> I'm so confused
[1:16:51] <spongeofmystery> This sounds like securities fraud
[1:16:51] <%BreakfastSampler> they can afford it

[1:16:55] <Flame_Water> thank god gta online doesnt work like this
[1:16:56] <%BinaryFireball> I love it
[1:16:57] <%GIGA255> This is why I ignore crafting and make all my momey from map loot, and materia sales from hunt trains.
[1:17:00] <%Agami23> i dunno. i bought the undercut stuff and sold it for higher and actually got buyers
[1:17:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> now this is capitalism
[1:17:05] <%shurtal> i ended up paying about 6ish million total for all my gear
[1:17:07] <%IamGrapes> and thats called "Workikng The Market"
[1:17:09] <$Rancaliber_> You think people won't buy at 10M+? Go look at PSO2 and tell me otherwise.
[1:17:15] <%AlteisenReiseZ> "Patrick Boivin: The Art of the Deal"
[1:17:17] <%Valdorick> Wait... you said it was 2 hours and nothing had sold? Doesn't that mean... they WEREN'T going to sell at 10M?
[1:17:21] <ExpressNode> Sound like scalpers. Buy limited low sell high
[1:17:23] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @fabpsi_ hell yeah as someone who wasnt interested in that mod i laughed so hard when it happened
[1:17:27] <%captain_thickthighs> there's quality in digital crafting

[1:19:10] <$The_Angry_God_Hoogs> I couldn't get  into the crafting system in ff14 like improving the item reduces the durability.
[1:19:13] <%pokefan9956> MY BRAND
[1:19:17] <%Valdorick> @Valdorick In two hours though? The price was dropping that fast in 2 hours and NO ONE was looking to buy yet? That says the market was absolutely too high. Even had it stabilized, most buyers were waiting for the price war to happen anyway.
[1:19:17] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Master Assasin!
[1:19:18] <@Ranryu692> is PatShep with Special Eyes one of the new emotes?
[1:19:22] <CryHavoc_12> Masster AssAssin Pat :P
[1:19:25] <spongeofmystery> This DLC is legit better than the base game
[1:19:29] <2meito> damn rip
[1:19:30] <ExpressNode> Your eye would be bloodshot from fart gases
[1:19:33] <2meito> elmo didn't get the raisin cookie
[1:19:39] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Did Pat ever finish the base game?
[1:19:47] <Fabpsi_> I still like the art-style
[1:19:47] <ReaversEdge45> Love that the hardest difficulty shows Daud about to bodyslam a bitch lol
[1:19:48] <sungiant_> such a cool idea for a dlc
[1:19:49] <%captain_thickthighs> yes
[1:19:59] <%superc37> @nigelschnauzerpug yeah, off stream
[1:20:01] <marvel877> he finished it, but not on stream
[1:20:01] <Fabpsi_> overall a cool idea for a game
[1:20:05] <+redthebaron> we get to see it from the other side
[1:20:11] <sauceboss310> sugoiAwawa sugoiAwawa sugoiAwawa
[1:20:22] <akitanito> you dun goof daud
[1:20:28] <sungiant_> this is the hero
[1:20:29] <%MidnightPacif1c> you gonna bark all day little doggy
[1:20:35] <sungiant_> what a hero
[1:20:37] <Fabpsi_> what a hero
[1:20:41] <%PhysicsLB> PhysicsLB subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[1:20:42] <%Tyrimat> Daud is so cool
[1:20:47] <%CalderGaming> I still think about the demon voice that plays for Daud's vision activation
[1:20:50] <CryHavoc_12> CrreamAwk
[1:20:54] <%BinaryFireball> michal mads mickleson madson
[1:20:55] <%SharkMissile> I really wish we got to find out the deal with the whales
[1:21:00] <huskarl_zap> What's not carried over in the sequel is that corvo is basically Rasputin
[1:21:00] <spongeofmystery> Get ready for the best Blink upgrade
[1:21:03] <%superc37> @patstaresat note behind you btw
[1:21:12] <akitanito> oh no
[1:21:17] <Fabpsi_> Pat don't die on stream
[1:21:17] <CryHavoc_12> Sudden death Lmao
[1:21:17] <%RealThiele> the whales and the outsider were criminally under utilized
[1:21:18] <Laecerelius> Drowned in spit
[1:21:19] <2meito> whoa
[1:21:19] <%cooldude69xx> ha
[1:21:19] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> THEY GOT PAT
[1:21:22] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Pat in danger?
[1:21:25] <%NitronStreams> RIP
[1:21:25] <Fabpsi_> you know you it will happen 1 day, but pls not yet
[1:21:28] <%UvBenServed> F
[1:21:28] <+kewlmyc> So, the DLC is about the bad guy?
[1:21:30] <%pokefan9956> I always knew pat would die live on steam
[1:21:32] <+PrimalDweeb> I hate it when that happens
[1:21:32] <huskarl_zap> time for your 12th rna vaccine
[1:21:33] <marvel877> its the rona
[1:21:34] <%bassoontyphoon> ! LUNGS AT RISK !
[1:21:35] <penitentpendant> Gives you extra time to STYLE
[1:21:37] <%pokefan9956> *stream
[1:21:38] <ReaversEdge45> How could this happen to pat?!? Lol
[1:21:39] <Dead_Trickster> Oh no, the vitamins are killing Pat
[1:21:44] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Make sure to die on stream to maximize your profit
[1:21:45] <sungiant_> hero
[1:21:46] <BrownMcgee> You did infact kill her
[1:21:47] <jtsoppy137> i think you killed her
[1:21:48] <2meito> praying for you
[1:21:50] <+redthebaron> good note
[1:21:53] <akitanito> vitamins detoxing pat
[1:21:57] <CryHavoc_12> ! Pat at risk !
[1:22:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its so much better
[1:22:03] <akitanito> that was some weird freezing there
[1:22:05] <sungiant_> its so busted
[1:22:06] <Highimbrighton> Doing okay Pat?
[1:22:08] <jtsoppy137> Dio blink
[1:22:11] <%MaddyCaddy> It's ridiculously good
[1:22:11] <Zombrocom> Corvo gets it in dishonored 2 as well
[1:22:11] <Fabpsi_> oh yes, it is a great power
[1:22:13] <Animal_Farm4> Corvo's has better range I think?
[1:22:16] <$StrawberryPantsu> He's the Virgil
[1:22:18] <ReaversEdge45> It feels snappy
[1:22:20] <$StrawberryPantsu> Has to be better
[1:22:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I legit tried to mod it into the base game but it was impossible
[1:22:24] <%Divryne> They did for D2.
[1:22:24] <+redthebaron> he gets it in 2
[1:22:25] <sungiant_> its a different mechanic
[1:22:25] <outsidedoubtside> Daud's time pause blink becomes an upgrade in Dishonored 2
[1:22:28] <ElSuperNova> Its so good they put it into all they're subsequent games
[1:22:29] <%MaddyCaddy> I always thought it was to show they have different powers that are similar
[1:22:30] <+critikal_bit> Corvo does get it in Dishonored 2
[1:22:34] <marvel877> he gets it in 2 as an upgrade
[1:22:36] <+WeLucklessJacks> He also gets better tranq darts.
[1:22:39] <%cooldude69xx> He's a diferent guy, why not different version of the power?
[1:22:43] <+upandadam> 2 though
[1:22:44] <BrownMcgee> You would think they would put it in wiuth the new version
[1:22:47] <@Ranryu692> Corvo has had his powers longer
[1:22:50] <+Dawndeather> He doesn't Emily does
[1:22:54] <sungiant_> yeah i thought it was just meant to be different
[1:22:55] <Fabpsi_> I think he gets it in 2, looking at all the people saying this while other people already said it
[1:22:55] <%Agami23> i mean, isnt it because daud is way more used to it and has more training?
[1:22:56] <@Ranryu692> sorry, Daud, not Corvo
[1:22:58] <a_mad_dragon_> daud has more experience with werird powers
[1:23:01] <spongeofmystery> It's such an incredibly panic button
[1:23:04] <ReaversEdge45> Tew
[1:23:06] <Sunstalker> Probably too strong for corvo to have it when he's a baby magic man in 1
[1:23:16] <Fabpsi_> Hi there totally normal guy
[1:23:17] <BrownMcgee> Also the outsider voice in 1 is much better than 2
[1:23:18] <%RD_NX> Hey lucifer
[1:23:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Playing as Corvo in 2 is so much bettter. Emilys powers are very unbalanced
[1:23:22] <slipdog> oh hes playing the dub DansGame
[1:23:23] <%superc37> @dawndeather no, emily has slow down. corvo gets full time stop while blinking
[1:23:26] <BrownMcgee> In 2 he sounds kinda whiny
[1:23:27] <akitanito> the outsider hates it
[1:23:31] <ReaversEdge45> @brownmcgee MILES better
[1:23:32] <Fabpsi_> look at this happy and friendly men
[1:23:34] <Fabpsi_> nothing wrong there
[1:23:36] <Calek> 8 people bearing his mark, and we still follow Corvo/Emily in 2
[1:23:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> CAN WE MEET MORE OF THE 8? NOPE
[1:23:43] <%OrangeMDT> Yeah, but did you know he gets it in 2?
[1:23:43] <Dyldo365> How you gonna birth a beautiful baby boy and name the poor fucker Daud?
[1:23:44] <CryHavoc_12> Its diet coke Adam driver LUL
[1:23:48] <Afterman_> god i love the outsider more before they got the gotham penguin
[1:23:51] <DeltaPangaea> All I know about Dishonored 2 is making Emily eat like, a SHITLOAD of rats.
[1:23:57] <%JoshManVGH> Die mad you salty magic bitch
[1:23:58] <akitanito> I hate what they did to him in 2
[1:24:04] <DeltaPangaea> Making her dad proud
[1:24:11] <%JoshManVGH> After Dark even
[1:24:14] <%BinaryFireball> so tiny
[1:24:17] <Laecerelius> YEAH!
[1:24:17] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> those are TINY
[1:24:18] <BrownMcgee> Are these subtitles for ants?
[1:24:18] <HeroToxiko> this is that one jojo fight guy right?
[1:24:19] <Fabpsi_> nawww.. subtitles for ANTS
[1:24:20] <+redthebaron> so smoll
[1:24:21] <+kewlmyc> subtitles for ants
[1:24:21] <Laecerelius> Ant subtitles!
[1:24:22] <Dyldo365> Hey there Delilah, what's it like in New York City...
[1:24:22] <Jontman42> imagine reading
[1:24:23] <sirrice77> I don't remember what he was like in 2, must've blocked it from memory
[1:24:23] <@Ranryu692> You can't read those?
[1:24:24] <akitanito> holy shit subtitle for ants
[1:24:26] <Reveresao> My the baby eyes
[1:24:26] <foomaster22> lmao
[1:24:26] <yukichocomilk> subtitles for fucking ANTS
[1:24:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Delilah did nothing wrong
[1:24:29] <mr_saturday93> gotta squint REAL HARD
[1:24:29] <Fabpsi_> wait let me get my binocular
[1:24:30] <%CalderGaming> whoever got that friend request, sorry that was unintentional you can ignore it
[1:24:30] <2meito> good name
[1:24:32] <BigYanno> the subtitles require one of those opera binoculars
[1:24:32] <%cooldude69xx> Who the fuck are these little dots on the screen for?
[1:24:32] <%bassoontyphoon> psaWhat
[1:24:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> what even is DPI scaling
[1:24:38] <BrownMcgee> This guy doesn't have perfect vision LUL
[1:24:38] <Afterman_> whole shit look at those tiny as letters. clearly meant for the RATS
[1:24:39] <Dyldo365> I'm a thousand miles away, but girl tonight you look so pretty...
[1:24:41] <Afterman_> holy*
[1:24:41] <Dyldo365> Yes you do.
[1:24:43] <%OrangeMDT> It’s what you do to me
[1:24:44] <%MidnightPacif1c> psaWhat
[1:24:47] <sungiant_> billy lurk is a powerful name
[1:24:48] <Fabpsi_> scaling? you don't need that
[1:24:51] <%NitronStreams> Honey get the Microscope I cant read the subtitles
[1:24:51] <slipdog> holy shit holy shit holy shit
[1:24:54] <Flame_Water> are these sub titles for tiny ants?
[1:24:58] <slipdog> its all coming together
[1:24:58] <ScreamLord> All I see is "......................"
[1:24:59] <+redthebaron> i need to get so close to my screen to see it
[1:25:01] <%SharkMissile> Senor Chang.gif
[1:25:01] <+Dawndeather> Damn, lots of references to Dishonored 2
[1:25:03] <BrownMcgee> Billy lurk is a proper criminal name
[1:25:04] <%captain_thickthighs> I thinks she in New York city where the lights are so pretty
[1:25:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> TIME FIR WHUSSY
[1:25:20] <BigYanno> why would you keep multiple snakes in a bag?
[1:25:20] <%dalmek> gonna need that new telescope to read those subtitles
[1:25:30] <BrownMcgee> Isn't this dlc the kind of set up for D2?
[1:25:31] <Dyldo365> "special favours"
[1:25:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> Knussy of Dunwall
[1:25:37] <Jolly_Adventurer> Yaayy bribery
[1:25:45] <%superc37> @dawndeather well yeah, dishonored 1 is the first game lol
[1:25:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @brownmcgee Sorta. 2 wasnt planned then
[1:26:00] <sungiant_> i didnt like that theres kinda content locked behind paying currency
[1:26:10] <%MaddyCaddy> The reload is really good
[1:26:11] <BrownMcgee> @BallerSwagBro9k Oh so they just winged it, eh fair enough
[1:26:30] <Dyldo365> Where's the favour for a handy round the back of the High Overseer's office?
[1:26:32] <akitanito> so you can shoot faster
[1:26:34] <%bassoontyphoon> is that morse code on the bottom of the screen?
[1:26:53] <Treasure_Vault> I'd totally cheat money in to not miss out on shit
[1:26:55] <Jolly_Adventurer> @Dyldo365 That's new game +
[1:26:59] <%MaddyCaddy> You can save it
[1:27:04] <+Dawndeather> @superc37 Just this DLC in particular, referencing Billie Lurk, the ship called the Delilah, really interesting
[1:27:04] <Profmcstevie> The reckless man loves items
[1:27:04] <BrownMcgee> It carrys over
[1:27:05] <Animal_Farm4> I think it carries over
[1:27:07] <%superc37> @brownmcgee not "winged it" so much as they made a nice self contained story for the dlc that they would later decide to expand on for a sequel
[1:27:16] <Afterman_> @PatStaresAt  money carries from level to level buy w/e u want. also how do u feel about reaper in 14? havent heard you talk about ur thoughts on it
[1:27:18] <mrcelab> COPIUMOD
[1:27:25] <slipdog> anybody got any naughty Dishonored stories? SeriousSloth
[1:27:26] <CryHavoc_12> SEVe dey Jugo
[1:27:33] <ReaversEdge45> Hope to see some silent takedowns with Daud
[1:27:34] <%superc37> @dawndeather well yeah, after all the dlc is where all that stuff came from
[1:27:50] <marvel877> Time to fight them Mindgoblins
[1:27:51] <penitentpendant> Combo Nation~
[1:28:05] <%JoshManVGH> I really like the Bribe bonus thing to this.
[1:28:12] <Calek> void gaze is a lot worse than the heart
[1:28:13] <sungiant_> this void is different
[1:28:20] <jtsoppy137> Bone Eyes
[1:28:21] <%bassoontyphoon> I imagine voidgaze is because you dont have the heart
[1:28:23] <+Dawndeather> Oh void gaze is the heart for this DLC
[1:28:29] <sungiant_> the heart is so fucking good
[1:28:31] <%barrakuta371> Is that Grief loudly breathing in the background or is Paige doing something?
[1:28:43] <%CalderGaming> THERE's the sound
[1:28:43] <%JoshManVGH> Need something new because no telltale heart
[1:28:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BILLIE
[1:28:45] <Fabpsi_> Zengiefs new function "bark of the outsider", he barks when interesting stuff is nearby, or nothing is going on. It really is a 50/50 chance
[1:28:48] <Animal_Farm4> It's a toggle which is nice
[1:28:54] <Afterman_> Daud is dumb strong tbh
[1:29:12] <Afterman_> cant wait to see how pat decides to play as daud and what choices he makew
[1:29:14] <Sunstalker> fucking punchcards
[1:29:19] <Afterman_> makes*
[1:29:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Billie got much darker with age LUL
[1:29:28] <%SharkMissile> r slash antiworm
[1:29:29] <rosemon5001> look at whale trying to fly LUL
[1:29:31] <Highimbrighton> I’m playing dishonored one definitive edition rn it’s a great game
[1:29:32] <Dyldo365> You could very easily make a parody game in the vain of Dishonored where istead of the literal whale juice that powers the city, it runs off the sweat and tears of people who spends their life savings on micro transactions.
[1:29:33] <%SharkMissile> work
[1:29:37] <GarbageNirvana> This ain't the one lady is it
[1:29:42] <%superc37> god billie lurks the shit
[1:29:42] <HeroToxiko> when they say prison they mean "plantation"
[1:29:43] <Afterman_> also did anyone else shit the bed when they realized deathloop is future dishonored world?
[1:29:43] <mr_saturday93> Her voice is different than D2
[1:29:47] <Fabpsi_> here, have some old mystic RUNES i found nearby in a dumpster
[1:29:51] <Fabpsi_> byeeee
[1:30:03] <%superc37> summon assassin may as will be worthless
[1:30:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @mr_saturday93 her face too
[1:30:17] <Afterman_> get agility
[1:30:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> yup
[1:30:22] <%SharkMissile> Agility is very helpful  always
[1:30:22] <Afterman_> agility is good
[1:30:23] <%bassoontyphoon> Good thing there's a strike today at the whussy processing plant
[1:30:25] <%superc37> @mr_saturday93 in d2, shes voiced by rosaria dawson
[1:30:27] <BrownMcgee> Jumping high is cool
[1:30:27] <Sapphire_Breeze> agility is good
[1:30:31] <AngryAsian5> JUMP GOOD
[1:30:33] <Profmcstevie> Agility and Blink, become da spidahman
[1:30:33] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:30:35] <+sapphic_fae> Agility is super worth it
[1:30:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Blink and Agility are always top priority
[1:30:41] <ReaversEdge45> Im curious if master assassin is even that good
[1:30:46] <Fabpsi_> sneaky is fun
[1:30:54] <Afterman_> the kill shit is good if youre like the BRassassin dude on yt
[1:30:57] <BrownMcgee> The enemies in this level are annoying to fight anyway
[1:30:57] <Afterman_> he makes that shit look good
[1:30:58] <sungiant_> murdering is just more fun
[1:31:01] <ElSuperNova> Lethal stealth the best
[1:31:02] <penitentpendant> Stealth has always been more compelling to me.
[1:31:08] <%superc37> @reaversedge45 its not.
[1:31:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @reaversedge45 for distraction yes
[1:31:15] <Profmcstevie> Anyone can engage in head to head combat, it's not the appeal of Dishonoured imo
[1:31:20] <+ThomasOfTroy> Murderous sneaking is the way to play most of these kinds of games imo
[1:31:23] <akitanito> Lethal sneak and throwing dead bodies into people is fun
[1:31:29] <ReaversEdge45> That makes sense
[1:31:34] <%Nobrev> @Afterman_ stealthgamerbr?
[1:31:51] <%pokefan9956> is this deathloop Kappa
[1:31:55] <Afterman_> @Nobrev  yea him. hes a god
[1:32:00] <$realm_forge> Wow Kellogg’s doesn’t fuck around
[1:32:00] <Laecerelius> GUN!  GUN!  GUN!
[1:32:18] <+redthebaron> sneakly shooting gun
[1:32:20] <Afterman_> @pokefan9956  technically it is, just in the pasty
[1:32:20] <%SharkMissile> I like that this game makes all the watch officers hilariously corrupt and evil so you feel OK murdering them
[1:32:23] <Afterman_> past*
[1:32:33] <jtsoppy137> nani
[1:32:36] <+FreshlyGratedGinger> LUL
[1:32:47] <%superc37> @patstaresat void gaze becomes dark vision after upgrading it
[1:32:48] <Fabpsi_> mr. pat is helping me find my gun
[1:32:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Indeed I believe so
[1:33:02] <%pokefan9956> @Afterman_ I knew that, but careful, that's a spoiler for people who don't know
[1:33:04] <Sapphire_Breeze> rats rats we are the rats 🐀
[1:33:06] <GarbageNirvana> Did he just choke that dude out mid-convo and no one bat an eye
[1:33:07] <salsabear1995> I've been meaning to try this. I don't know why I haven't lol
[1:33:11] <%bassoontyphoon> rats rats we are the rats
[1:33:13] <akitanito> ew
[1:33:14] <+redthebaron> chunky rats
[1:33:15] <CryHavoc_12> "Mr. Boivin is helping me find my gun"
[1:33:30] <+Pixel_Matt> D:
[1:33:33] <akitanito> just take out the fuel
[1:33:35] <Afterman_> @pokefan9956  ehh i feel like it's just lore. it doesn't really go deep into it i thought other than mentioning tyvia?
[1:33:48] <Afterman_> but then again i only read that on the dl subreddit
[1:33:55] <spongeofmystery> @CryHavoc_12 "Mr. Boivin is helping me find my gun"
[1:34:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @sharkmissile Yeah Jessamine was....kinda a terrible ruler. Literally all her officials were evil and corrupt lol
[1:34:49] <CryHavoc_12> psaWhat Yeaaah
[1:34:51] <Fabpsi_> glad nobody saw that
[1:35:30] <CryHavoc_12> @spongeofmystery "Mr. Boivin is helping me find my gun."
[1:35:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Except Corvo of course
[1:36:01] <+BlueLunecy> Topical
[1:36:01] <%tank7013> Treas-on deez nuts
[1:36:12] <spongeofmystery> @CryHavoc_12 "Mr. Boivin is helping me find my gun"
[1:36:24] <+withguac> CDC help make that announcement?
[1:36:25] <ReaversEdge45> Daud’s blink is so clean. Love how much more snappier it is compared to Corvo’s
[1:36:38] <%Cozy90> THAT RAT SOUNDED LIKE A PIANO
[1:36:42] <+redthebaron> i love the idea of a sneaky assasin just stuffing himself with stuff as he goes
[1:36:43] <Fabpsi_> "what's that? A rat flying across the room leaving blood on the floor?" - "oh, probably nothing"
[1:36:43] <%TheWinged7> @spongeofmystery Mr Gun is helping me find my Boivin
[1:36:55] <Treasure_Vault> Even a good totalitarian is a totalitarian
[1:37:07] <%tank7013> He's really into that shelf
[1:37:11] <akitanito> just shoot him
[1:37:15] <%bassoontyphoon> kill da scab
[1:37:19] <%Valdorick> "Is that a full ass man leaning around a corner? Nah... must be nothing."
[1:37:28] <Yourule3> Ghost dude
[1:37:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YUP
[1:37:30] <%SinnerEbru> noice!!!
[1:37:34] <ReaversEdge45> “Musta been nothin”
[1:37:35] <akitanito> a man-sized rat
[1:37:37] <Animal_Farm4> The only downside to Daud's is that it doesn't go as far, even at level 2
[1:37:38] <+KaizenChaos> Vergil
[1:37:40] <%tank7013> Well the Vergil is supposed to be better
[1:37:41] <%OrangeMDT> @ballerswagbro9k she was betrayed and died, yet you still blame the woman psaDown
[1:37:42] <Profmcstevie> is he meant to be portrayed as more powerful?

[1:38:03] <DeltaPangaea> Yeah Daud's had his powers for like, ages by now.
[1:38:05] <sungiant_> hes meant to feel like youre more advanced
[1:38:05] <oda_flobunaga> So, He's the anti-Kai Leng?
[1:38:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I feel like I should play through the Dishonored games, the gameplay seems fun and story seems interesting
[1:38:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @orangemdt She should've GIT GUD woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN woolieMIRIN

[1:38:27] <%MaddyCaddy> It doesn't until it hits the third level
[1:38:29] <outsidedoubtside> Trade off is less range and Daud at most gets three powers
[1:38:31] <Fabpsi_> man that piano player is just on point. Waiting for his time to play those notes. Watching every step of you, his fingers over the keys

[1:40:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Huh?
[1:40:36] <Zedkan> is death loop related to dishoored? or just bc it took time away from it
[1:40:37] <sungiant_> corvo attano D:
[1:40:42] <Zedkan> dishonored*
[1:40:45] <%SharkMissile> I just wanna know more about the whales!!
[1:40:46] <willyfreshness> Dishonored: Cones of Dunshire
[1:40:51] <+Dawndeather> @BigCoffee Because the connection to Dishonored is there but it's such a nothingburger that it doesn't even matter
[1:40:54] <Profmcstevie> Wow this Corvo guys sounds cringe
[1:40:55] <crispyfresh49> this is relatively in the beginning right?
[1:41:00] <Afterman_> do you wwanna know zedkan
[1:41:01] <ReaversEdge45> @sharkmissile same
[1:41:04] <Fabpsi_> Disloop? Deathhonered?
[1:41:10] <GarbageNirvana> Can't you totally use dudes to break your fall
[1:41:11] <%superc37> @zedkan deathloop canonically takes place like a century after death of the outsider
[1:41:18] <tpc28> We're whalers on the moon! hyzengOp

[1:41:46] <%superc37> @bigcoffee YUP.
[1:41:52] <%JoshManVGH> I always headcannoned Corvo not knowing how to stop time with Blink due to his unfamiliarity with the power. Daud has had years of practice with Blink at this point.
[1:41:56] <%superc37> @afterman_ oh yeah, thats right
[1:42:02] <bippityjones> Tiger Whale
[1:42:05] <akitanito> "fish"
[1:42:09] <+BigCoffee> @superc37 is that what people say about the ending of deathloop sucking?
[1:42:10] <Neo_Kaiser> So why wasn't it called DIshonored 3: Deathloop?
[1:42:10] <jtsoppy137> when i hear whistling i think of that mission in mgs 4
[1:42:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> tiger whale let's go

[1:42:23] <%superc37> id dm ya the spoilers if i was busy getting ready to leave for work lol
[1:42:25] <%JoshManVGH> Corvo doesn't even learn what blink IS until he overhears the training in Dauds camp.
[1:42:28] <Afterman_> @superc37 everything is fucked up from what i remember reading, red ass sky, void eating shit up.

[1:42:54] <%Deft_Thought> Y I K E S
[1:42:59] <%superc37> @bigcoffee no, thats just cuz it has like a non existent endgame

[1:43:20] <Fabpsi_> nah, missed nothing, he is not playing the main game, just enjoying the dlc so far (as you can see in the title lol )
[1:43:24] <akitanito> Imagine billy lurk seeing you do that

[1:43:39] <penitentpendant> It's still a tool to be used, just not abused

[1:43:50] <Fabpsi_> wondering what that old man is doing
[1:43:52] <+Skypepper1> Does this game still give you 2 non-lethal but 12 lethal options?
[1:43:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Nah man abuse that shit
[1:43:59] <Afterman_> the outsider just fucking laughed his ass off at daud dying

[1:44:17] <AngryAsian5> Scum that save. You know you want to.
[1:44:20] <Profmcstevie> Just quicksave after you clear a building or something, make it a nice ribbon

[1:46:04] <%RD_NX> If you do 2, who will you play as
[1:46:08] <Fabpsi_> or are you detroit and do you have to become human?
[1:46:13] <outsidedoubtside> Dishonored 2 is a much smoother play experience, it's a matter of taste how you feel about the setting/story
[1:46:16] <bippityjones> Granny said Do It
[1:46:19] <Profmcstevie> Hey man, you dropping that target to his death by accident in Dishonoured 1 was the most human I've EVER seen you

[1:46:22] <%The_0_2_Hero> I had the same issue when I first played Dishonored 1, where I'd keep reloading after getting caught and it killed all my enjoyment

[1:56:03] <%tank7013> Are they guard dogs?
[1:56:09] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @akitanito Don't most factory jobs keep mines in the locker room?
[1:56:12] <+rdark_ksu> up is an illusion
[1:56:27] <ElSuperNova> This would be a fucking hard game if they could, or look into shadows
[1:56:29] <akitanito> you don't even need go there pat
[1:56:34] <a_mad_dragon_> higher difficulty gives them better vertical vision
[1:56:36] <%RigmaroleHM> They're like dogs
[1:56:46] <penitentpendant> Phasers set to MOIDER
[1:56:46] <%ErikFeral> Traitor!!
[1:56:57] <%ErikFeral> the world!
[1:57:02] <+matf8> can't be spotted if everyone dies
[1:57:25] <bippityjones> Or you can kill em
[1:57:26] <akitanito> the entrance
[1:57:41] <Latija> "accident"
[1:57:44] <penitentpendant> "Oops! All Murder!"
[1:57:45] <Ghufufin> wink wink
[1:57:46] <sungiant_> legendarily assassinated them accidentally
[1:57:47] <Laecerelius> Just murder everyone, the Eversor Assassin way!
[1:57:51] <%MidnightBurst12> whoops. all dead.
[1:57:53] <ScreamLord> Manslaughter they calls it
[1:57:56] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> It's THEIR fault they looked.
[1:57:59] <+rdark_ksu> sometimes you accidentally stab 7 different men in a row. it happens
[1:58:02] <%SinnerEbru> "accident"
[1:58:24] <+redthebaron> daud is a friend to workers
[1:58:29] <DeltaPangaea> I mean to be fair, Daud STARTS the game as a massive assassin man. He's done the big kill already.
[1:58:41] <Calek> now turn the wall of light back on
[1:58:57] <GarbageNirvana> Daud and Marx  go way back
[1:59:08] <outsidedoubtside> It's so cool that Arkane made a level for us in the Kellogg's factory
[1:59:13] <ElSuperNova> Daud glorious friend of the proletariat
[1:59:22] <ScreamLord> I don't think the courts are gonna buy 17 counts of Manslaughter. Which sounds WAY worse than murder TBH
[1:59:26] <+matf8> why is the safe code scribbled on this random wall?
[1:59:28] <Calek> I brute forced a lot of these safes
[1:59:44] <DeltaPangaea> Because he bought a favor to get it.
[1:59:55] <%shurtal> time to work a double?
[1:59:55] <DeltaPangaea> Some guy got paid off to leave it there
[1:59:59] <outsidedoubtside> @matf8 that was the favor he bought at level start
[2:00:03] <ElSuperNova> Collect em all
[2:00:03] <Latija> they had it coming
[2:00:05] <%Deft_Thought> You're so gainfully employed
[2:00:07] <%SharkMissile> @matf8 yeah what he said
[2:00:13] <+matf8> ah ok thanks I missed that part
[2:00:22] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Everyone goes on a murderous rampage every now and again. It happens to the best of us.
[2:00:23] <sungiant_> sometimes assassins gotta assassinate
[2:01:01] <+VladVandal> Jamaican me wanna play this game again
[2:01:01] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:01:59] <sungiant_> im sure they understand
[2:02:24] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I missed it, how did pat do  big kill?
[2:02:38] <tanarath> "Say anything if you don't understand... good!"
[2:02:38] <DeltaPangaea> He goofed and did the murder.
[2:02:58] <DeltaPangaea> Or he goofed and got spotted and did a big murder to not get done a big murder upon.
[2:03:14] <sungiant_> you keep momentum
[2:03:26] <ReaversEdge45> “By the way, have you seen my sword up close?” *stab*

[2:08:18] <+rdark_ksu> Can't talk now babe, I'm in the whale
[2:08:23] <Latija> aaieeee

[2:08:26] <Tatsabutt> Wait is that whale back there moving
[2:08:30] <%MidnightBurst12> mining for whussy oil
[2:08:32] <bippityjones> Generalized Evil
[2:08:37] <%RyTYoung> I really don't know how the main game didn't have a whale in any level at all, only in this dlc
[2:08:38] <Tatsabutt> Like all the way back strung up on chains
[2:08:50] <Fabpsi_> those dudes look like normal people
[2:08:52] <sungiant_> regular butchers
[2:08:53] <Fabpsi_> why not say hi
[2:08:59] <mads_valentine> Those are the butchers!
[2:09:05] <marvel877> organ grinders?
[2:09:06] <%maenos2> oh right these guys
[2:09:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BUZZSAWS
[2:09:09] <mads_valentine> They shoot knives!
[2:09:17] <Fabpsi_> every butcher needs a...what is that, a mechanical giant saw with an energy-backpack?
[2:09:27] <%ElkRiverDog> Non union evil
[2:09:44] <%Bailey__Gaming> Looks like these guys really jumped the shark
[2:09:52] <%Agami23> if you shoot them in the back, do they explode?
[2:09:53] <Fabpsi_> backpacks make people assassin proof
[2:09:58] <DeltaPangaea> They gotta do some heavy duty cuttin'
[2:09:58] <%OrangeMDT> This is why we need unions
[2:09:58] <Fabpsi_> the more you know
[2:10:18] <akitanito> just shoot him
[2:10:19] <Fabpsi_> we need unions because of assassins? Well, you are not wrong
[2:10:20] <jtsoppy137> Mugged
[2:10:20] <%MidnightBurst12> oh jesus
[2:10:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> bodied

[2:10:24] <tanarath> hmmmm
[2:10:24] <bippityjones> Parry this!
[2:10:25] <+pectusumbra> yeah that went about as bad as it could have
[2:10:25] <DeltaPangaea> Swinging at them would probably be bad!
[2:10:29] <sungiant_> butchering eldritch monsters is hard work
[2:10:31] <%RyTYoung> welp
[2:10:32] <ElSuperNova> Literally in a corner
[2:10:32] <+VladVandal> dang yo
[2:10:33] <RLT917> atpCap
[2:10:33] <%Bane_Kaikyo> wauw
[2:10:34] <+redthebaron> yeah it was a saw
[2:10:36] <%MidnightBurst12> absolutely bodied
[2:10:37] <DeltaPangaea> But you're choking them out so you go over the back for the neck
[2:10:37] <+TheBitingIrish> Bonesaw, was indeed, ready
[2:10:41] <%SinnerEbru> jesus
[2:10:42] <+rdark_ksu> never underestimate a good ol power tool

[2:10:44] <%Bailey__Gaming> Chainsaws >> knife
[2:10:46] <%snugglepuggs> Pat should have SAW that coming
[2:10:47] <akitanito> he's got whale fuel on his back
[2:10:54] <+pectusumbra> @redthebaron No no, it was a Pat. He dressed as a Saw, remember
[2:10:58] <Ghufufin> look if he just walks at you slowly with a spinning saw its ur fault if u get hurt
[2:11:08] <Fabpsi_> Butcher thinks "you have a sword? Well parry this, casual!"
[2:11:08] <chuca77> hey guys is twitch shitting the bed here too
[2:11:15] <ElSuperNova> Aye they just be mobile red fuel tanks
[2:11:17] <%RyTYoung> I can't remember was there a morality system in the dlc or nah
[2:11:29] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Not for me @chuca77
[2:11:34] <mads_valentine> @RyTYoung Yes, there is.
[2:11:38] <SaltyAzteca> @fabpsi_ you forgot filthy
[2:11:49] <+DatAsuna> ah, late I see
[2:11:54] <Fabpsi_> rhyming four with floor...well I can see why he is no poet and became a butcher instead
[2:11:58] <northern18> there's one in every dishonored game except the D2 dlc
[2:11:58] <akitanito> yes
[2:12:03] <+DatAsuna> how's he enjoying it so far?
[2:12:19] <%RyTYoung> @mads_valentine I can't even remember when I went through the dlc last
[2:12:31] <Fabpsi_> having a lot of stealthy fun
[2:12:39] <%cooldude69xx> a lil nap is all
[2:12:41] <ovan20> he just fainted Kappa
[2:12:42] <%brisk_dacat> you killed him, he had a family pat
[2:12:50] <%SinnerEbru> nice save
[2:12:51] <+matf8> it's what he gets for doing scab work
[2:12:52] <Fabpsi_> he is not dead
[2:12:56] <Ethel9727> TOPICAL
[2:12:56] <akitanito> UNION
[2:12:56] <Fabpsi_> we are going with batman logic here
[2:12:58] <$realm_forge> He had too much blood anyway
[2:13:05] <Fabpsi_> batman never kills people, bat doesn't kill people
[2:13:09] <%TimetodiveLTX> let him live
[2:13:09] <Fabpsi_> they are...sleeping
[2:13:11] <ElSuperNova> UNIONIZE
[2:13:27] <+matf8> WORKERS OF THE WORLD, UNITE
[2:13:27] <ovan20> monkaS
[2:13:31] <akitanito> welp
[2:13:32] <Fabpsi_> and he is an animal lover, what a nice guy
[2:13:36] <+pectusumbra> good unions lets gooo
[2:13:41] <Fabpsi_> feeding hungry pet-rats
[2:13:43] <+pectusumbra> *goon. Goon unions
[2:13:46] <%SinnerEbru> its fine
[2:13:46] <+maffblunge> the rats just help them sleep by forming a warm fur blanket over them
[2:13:47] <foomaster22> Remember they don't look up
[2:13:47] <DaKnightWarrior> Cute rats lytAWW
[2:13:48] <mads_valentine> I hope scabs have a nice time.
[2:13:48] <Latija> wow I didn't know amazon warehouses were this bad
[2:13:54] <akitanito> looks like you can go up along the railings?
[2:13:56] <%epide> why does that not count as killing them?
[2:14:01] <%snugglepuggs> Hey it’s Clemps
[2:14:28] <Fabpsi_> again, he is not killing them. Rats kill them. Or gravity, or a natural death caused by a sword in the chest
[2:14:35] <Fabpsi_> not his fault when people die
[2:14:45] <%TimetodiveLTX> bruh
[2:14:50] <jbrachob> Hey Its the pizza room!
[2:14:52] <penitentpendant> UNION!?
[2:14:55] <mrtanaka111> EA?
[2:15:00] <ape_hawk> bootlickers
[2:15:08] <BigYanno> Remember kids unless you're the police you should always unionise
[2:15:10] <ElSuperNova> Time for a spot of torture
[2:15:14] <jbrachob> you get send there to get some pizza and get a nice talk about unions
[2:15:16] <+redthebaron> love to sign documents under duress
[2:15:19] <mrtanaka111> good ol not political game
[2:15:34] <$realm_forge> Every time the word union is uttered Bezos looses another hair follicle
[2:15:35] <GarbageNirvana> no politics here no sir
[2:15:36] <+pectusumbra> so refresh my memory, which studio worked on this game again?
[2:15:38] <Fabpsi_> what was that sound?
[2:15:47] <Calek> @pectusumbra Arkane
[2:16:00] <%snugglepuggs> Munch
[2:16:02] <Fabpsi_> no politics, only hard working men under normal conditions in an everyday job
[2:16:06] <mrtanaka111> what are  this pólytycs you keep talking about sir?
[2:16:07] <Fabpsi_> nothing to see, carry on
[2:16:09] <%snugglepuggs> “Musta been the wind”
[2:16:25] <GarbageNirvana> Published by Bethesda iirc
[2:16:37] <Profmcstevie> Winds loud today and sounds like people
[2:16:41] <GarbageNirvana> At least originally
[2:16:46] <+pectusumbra> @Calek thanks. clearly someone had some feelings about work I guess. Can't imagine why :p
[2:16:54] <akitanito> man that whale got gibbed hard
[2:16:56] <+PrimalDweeb> Really hate all the noise in that mode.
[2:17:10] <akitanito> RUN
[2:17:21] <Fabpsi_> that is no workplace safety!
[2:17:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> Did I miss a lot of good content?
[2:17:36] <Fabpsi_> that guy was running around with a buzzsaw while looking in a different direction
[2:17:38] <Zombrocom> Wish you could steal his saw
[2:17:38] <Fabpsi_> he could have hurt someone
[2:17:42] <+hero_theycallme210> RESTART
[2:17:43] <ElSuperNova> SAVED
[2:17:46] <akitanito> You miss pat being a pro assassin
[2:17:48] <SomeStrangeBroad> you have no honor!!
[2:17:51] <%tank7013> Good thing he was walking while looking directly behind himself for no reason
[2:17:53] <%SinnerEbru> good jorb
[2:18:00] <%RyTYoung> ye

[2:18:07] <jbrachob> Oh yeah
[2:18:12] <%JoshManVGH> Meat rain
[2:18:13] <%dalmek> whales are naturally explosive on land
[2:18:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> whales have a tendency to explode on their own
[2:18:17] <digimonda> i cant imagine blowing up a giant dead body going well for anyone
[2:18:20] <%RealThiele> in oregon LUL
[2:18:22] <%spitelite> yep methane explodes, who knew
[2:18:22] <Profmcstevie> Enough whale blubber to call it rain
[2:18:22] <%Bane_Kaikyo> "Daud, there's a makeshift interrogation room in the meat locker"
[2:18:22] <HeroToxiko> raining blooood
[2:18:24] <%MidnightBurst12> gotta let out the whale gasses
[2:18:27] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> then there was the surprise whale explosion due to built up gasses of the corpse
[2:18:28] <GarbageNirvana> Rained whale guts for a good while
[2:18:30] <@ssjklyco> they had a whale of a time
[2:18:37] <akitanito> why pat
[2:18:38] <%RyTYoung> LUL LUL LUL
[2:18:43] <Brapula_> Killing that rat was so mean

[2:18:48] <digimonda> kzxMonkaTg kzxMonkaTg
[2:18:53] <Latija> Clemps would hate this game
[2:18:57] <Fabpsi_> whale whale whale, what do we have here
[2:19:07] <%RyTYoung> @digimonda gigaboOtsMEOW gigaboOtsMEOW
[2:19:22] <Profmcstevie> Stealth games are built for slightly evil people, my kinda genre
[2:19:24] <digimonda> gigaboOtsBaneyUnleashed gigaboOtsBaneyUnleashed gigaboOtsBaneyUnleashed
[2:19:34] <%RyTYoung> gigaboOtsBaneyUnleashed gigaboOtsBaneyUnleashed gigaboOtsBaneyUnleashed
[2:19:37] <Fabpsi_> indeed... "slightly"
[2:19:51] <SomeStrangeBroad> hey pat do you know a game called this war of mine
[2:20:00] <akitanito> oh no the worst charm
[2:20:04] <Latija> just like prey
[2:20:20] <akitanito> agreed
[2:20:21] <%RyTYoung> yeah
[2:20:22] <Latija> they do stay in your inventory
[2:20:25] <mrtanaka111> Immersive maps
[2:20:26] <+redthebaron> yeah
[2:20:30] <Fabpsi_> it is always better to have a map available at all times
[2:20:31] <ElSuperNova> it do
[2:20:32] <%Arrotal> Arrotal subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! Hey Pat, as a fellow migraine sufferer I have recently found that the type of pillow I was use was a primary cause of aggravation,going from a neck supported pillow to a more flat pillow has eased the rate I get migraines, hopefully could help you as well
[2:20:39] <%SinnerEbru> yeah
[2:20:43] <+rafaelba93> its there inst it?
[2:20:45] <Fabpsi_> I like the menu/map when it comes to Metro for example, nice thing
[2:20:46] <Profmcstevie> At least give me a GENERAL map once I find it, like a "Dauds recollection" or something
[2:20:48] <%JoshManVGH> Part of the reason the Oregon Whale Explosion was so bad was because they used around 20 cases of dynamite. An onsite explosives expert tried to explain to them that 20 STICKS would have done the job.
[2:20:52] <+rafaelba93> maybe thats on 2
[2:20:54] <Shwepie> Just use the Print Screen button.
[2:20:55] <SomeStrangeBroad> does anyone here know a game called this war of mine?
[2:20:59] <KaiserMario> SOKOLOV??? The Shagohod?
[2:21:06] <mrtanaka111> bad sleep schedule is the n2 cause of constant migraines
[2:21:07] <Latija> should be in notes if its there
[2:21:11] <Profmcstevie> Holy shit Joshman LUL
[2:21:12] <Fabpsi_> Whales are a MYSTERY
[2:21:19] <Fabpsi_> noone knows how they work
[2:21:24] <Fabpsi_> Whales are the plains of the ocean
[2:21:27] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait i left for a bit, are you able to combine powers??
[2:21:28] <%VioletHeart> Y- yeah sure guys we'll cure the plague by next year.
[2:21:29] <HeroToxiko> Magnets
[2:21:32] <sungiant_> we have finished our conversation
[2:21:32] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Knife that guy i nthe dick
[2:21:41] <%Bane_Kaikyo> "Daud, There's an interrogation room in the meat locker. Might be useful.... for you to use..... Just thought it would be significant to bring up. The Investigation chair I mean."
[2:22:04] <DeltaPangaea> Confirmed, Billy's into electrostim.
[2:22:04] <HeroToxiko> "damn you corvo, you made magic real" LUL
[2:22:06] <%ChrisPlaysThing> shhh shhh shhh shhhhhhhh, only dreams now

[2:22:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> cool
[2:22:20] <+redthebaron> my bad
[2:22:47] <sungiant_> who knows
[2:22:51] <GarbageNirvana> I unno
[2:22:51] <Latija> maybe
[2:22:52] <+rafaelba93> yeah
[2:22:53] <+pectusumbra> isn't it the guy you want to kill?
[2:22:54] <Halospaz117> That's a sentence
[2:22:57] <Profmcstevie> Try any meat, for science
[2:22:58] <Fabpsi_> I would probably go for the summon assassin power if it would be called "summon billy, your assassin buttler" - it would still be a bad ability compared to others, buuuuut anyway...I digress
[2:22:59] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Oh, if that's the case then I'm an idiot
[2:23:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> choice of 2 people
[2:23:12] <SomeStrangeBroad> hired goons
[2:23:13] <northern18> im 90% sure its specific, but its been a while
[2:23:16] <vile_brand> good job pat
[2:23:18] <ElSuperNova> hmm
[2:23:19] <Fabpsi_> feeding hungry animals, very nice guy
[2:23:21] <mrtanaka111> chunky rats
[2:23:53] <sungiant_> haha 4Head
[2:23:56] <KaiserMario> You can hide them in water so the rats can't get to them
[2:24:02] <akitanito> smart
[2:24:03] <Fabpsi_> well, looking around there are not a lot of "working workers" left, now are there?
[2:24:23] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Just make sure they're face up and they'll be fine.
[2:24:23] <KaiserMario> But rats can't swim Pat
[2:24:34] <Profmcstevie> Rats can't swim nor can they climb in this universe
[2:24:34] <+JustToWatch> of course it is, rats can't swim
[2:24:35] <hakumaribo> why are the rats so vicious?
[2:24:42] <%snugglepuggs> Rats cants swim pat, remember?
[2:24:42] <+matf8> hide across a body of water pat
[2:24:44] <mrtanaka111> rats are bad swimmers, as seem in titanic
[2:24:47] <+hero_theycallme210> No you put them on anything above ground, clean hands achievment took forever
[2:24:49] <sonicblade38> if they didnt want rats to eat em they souldn have rubed whale blood on em sleves
[2:24:53] <DeltaPangaea> Plague makes rats hongry.
[2:24:55] <Fabpsi_> metroid can crawl and rats can swim, stop the fakenews!
[2:25:19] <Fabpsi_> "what's that? A person under a table looking at me?"
[2:25:25] <SomeStrangeBroad> rats....rats i tell you
[2:25:26] <%OrangeMDT> Sounds like a goblin
[2:25:32] <%RyTYoung> I would rather you had a sword, can choke them out, or knock them out with a stick and it temporarily knocks them out like in MGS
[2:25:33] <ovan20> LUL
[2:25:38] <Profmcstevie> Armoured
[2:25:38] <akitanito> his face shield
[2:25:41] <ElSuperNova> Helmet
[2:25:42] <a_mad_dragon_> FACE MASK
[2:25:42] <ovan20> so stealthy LUL
[2:25:50] <%snugglepuggs> Helmet
[2:25:50] <TheeRabbi> Lmao a fucking concrete saw
[2:25:50] <%RyTYoung> or punch whatever
[2:25:57] <Latija> Daud, master assassin
[2:25:58] <Zombrocom> That face shield can block bullets? Damn that's some strong plastic
[2:26:00] <%dashmatt> stelth
[2:26:01] <akitanito> Face masks confirmed to protect you from covid and bullets
[2:26:01] <%twistedj3ster> might as well kill 'em all now
[2:26:08] <+matf8> his plastic face shield blocked the bullets
[2:26:28] <%snugglepuggs> So this job IS safe! Even an assassin can’t kill them. Not hazardous
[2:26:36] <akitanito> @Zombrocom Needs to be strong enough to protect the person from stray bone chips during cutting process
[2:26:37] <DeltaPangaea> Yeah when 'unconscious' is functionally the same as dead besides morality it kind of loses some spice.
[2:26:39] <%RD_NX> ever see those face shields that protected grinders from flying saws
[2:26:40] <SomeStrangeBroad> bullet proof covid masks, that would be fucking sweet
[2:26:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Assassin Pat sneaks back into the shadows unseen, as the entire building is still shaking from the gunshots that just occured
[2:26:55] <+redthebaron> big whale
[2:27:03] <Fabpsi_> free that whale! save the earth! say no to nukes!
[2:27:03] <mrtanaka111> is this a PETA approved game?
[2:27:13] <%MidnightBurst12> oh no
[2:27:14] <ToneBacas> this is horrible
[2:27:15] <%shurtal> GET EYE
[2:27:16] <+PrimalDweeb> That's fucked up
[2:27:16] <marvel877> Pat gonna get vored by the whale
[2:27:17] <+TheBitingIrish> PogChamp
[2:27:20] <Latija> eye of whale, newly dead
[2:27:20] <%Bt_Robot> E Y E
[2:27:22] <digimonda> not alive for long based on the fact its disemboweled
[2:27:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WHUSSY
[2:27:26] <Zombrocom> Well that is FUCKED up
[2:27:27] <+ThomasOfTroy> Mega mercy kill time
[2:27:28] <+WeLucklessJacks> FREE THE WHALE! FEED IT THE FOREMAN!
[2:27:29] <Calek> @mrtanaka111 for sure
[2:27:30] <%Bane_Kaikyo> That's not the PORT eyeball
[2:27:32] <%twistedj3ster> finally Pat's playing Banjo
[2:27:33] <%Agami23> its weird how low the eyes are
[2:27:34] <tanarath> Oh god
[2:27:38] <%tank7013> That's fucked up
[2:27:39] <%JoshManVGH> They are jucing it while ALIVE!
[2:27:39] <Fabpsi_> painless death. Be nice
[2:27:40] <hakumaribo> is this the first or second game?
[2:27:40] <%SinnerEbru> D:
[2:27:41] <akitanito> well?
[2:27:42] <ape_hawk> can we... feed the foreman to the whale?
[2:27:42] <+BlueLunecy> Great work Sokolov
[2:27:42] <+RainFerret> Imagine having your eyes parallel to your mouth
[2:27:43] <+redthebaron> that is awful
[2:27:46] <+TheBitingIrish> Sokolov, you piece of shit
[2:27:49] <penitentpendant> Let it live or give it peace?
[2:27:57] <sungiant_> the whales hunt from the surface, looking for prey down below
[2:27:57] <a_mad_dragon_> save the whale: kill the whale
[2:28:01] <ToneBacas> fuck yeah Daud DLC
[2:28:05] <Fabpsi_> @hakumaribo it is the first game, not the main story but the dlc story "the knife of Dunwall"
[2:28:06] <ElSuperNova> Need that fresh eye tho
[2:28:12] <ape_hawk> because capitalism
[2:28:14] <akitanito> because they are eldritch creatures
[2:28:20] <+redthebaron> want whale juice
[2:28:26] <%twistedj3ster> Gil Alexander that thing and put it down
[2:28:27] <%tank7013> Because money
[2:28:31] <sungiant_> magic whale juice
[2:28:32] <Profmcstevie> This is what marketing people mean when they talk of players as "whales" :)
[2:28:34] <SomeStrangeBroad> poor mr whale
[2:28:35] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Remember the eye has to be from the PORT side
[2:28:35] <%snugglepuggs> Cuz moneys
[2:28:37] <Calek> because they're the source of electricity
[2:28:38] <%Ne1son> Whales are ancient unfeeling creatures
[2:28:40] <%Agami23> you should be able to execute people by feeding them to whale
[2:28:43] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt You need to make it jump out of its tail
[2:28:44] <%JoshManVGH> It's like how midgard is powered by the souls of orphans
[2:28:45] <%SinnerEbru> whale profitable
[2:28:46] <%Bt_Robot> Susan Sarandon needs that whale eye
[2:28:51] <jtsoppy137> nom nom nom
[2:28:56] <DeltaPangaea> The way to remember is that port and left both have four letters.
[2:29:03] <TheeRabbi> Hot rat action
[2:29:06] <penitentpendant> Quicksave before in case it doesn't go how you think?
[2:29:12] <Aiutare47> I like the little pitter-patter of douds slippers
[2:29:12] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Watching whales explode is intense.
[2:29:14] <%MidnightBurst12> mercy kill that whale
[2:29:15] <DeltaPangaea> Alternatively "The stars are right"
[2:29:22] <Fabpsi_> you are NOT killing the whale because of your personal profit. You want to release it from all the pain! (totally..of course....)
[2:29:23] <+PrimalDweeb> Just kill it fast, don't make it suffer further
[2:29:25] <jbrachob> safe just in case the eye explodes
[2:29:29] <%Agami23> @DeltaPangaea but lard also has 4 letters
[2:29:36] <%snugglepuggs> Kill whale make profit
[2:29:39] <Fabpsi_> rip
[2:29:43] <%snugglepuggs> Eat pizza
[2:29:44] <+PrimalDweeb> GG
[2:29:44] <@Lion_kun> Get in that whussy
[2:29:46] <Idon__> :(
[2:29:46] <DeltaPangaea> Lard has nothing to do with port and starboard tho
[2:29:46] <%MidnightBurst12> F
[2:29:47] <Calek> in its face
[2:29:47] <%twistedj3ster> whale saved!

[2:31:06] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah, it'd be surprising if this wasn't high chaos at this point
[2:31:08] <Profmcstevie> Nah, this is for sure low chaos cos the chaos system sucks
[2:31:11] <tanarath> Strikebreakers and guards are bad, though
[2:31:21] <%JoshManVGH> But did you die? I mean yeah we all saw it, but you get the point
[2:31:22] <outsidedoubtside> Pat's not gonna blow up the factory?

[3:04:24] <Profmcstevie> Someone cut together every kill that stage and that end screen
[3:04:24] <ElSuperNova> It like kill guard +1, chaos mission objective +100

[3:05:45] <+rafaelba93> you kill everyone for high chaos, nothing short of it will do

[3:31:24] <+NopeBadguy> we can't SEE him
[3:31:35] <+ThomasOfTroy> we can't see him, therefore he does not exist
[3:31:37] <%tank7013> Mission accomplished
[3:31:39] <dmysta3000> He is above us now
[3:31:40] <akitanito> but how pat know if he can't look up
[3:31:43] <+NopeBadguy> pick up the baby
[3:31:46] <tanarath> Elmo is a norwegian forest/street mix & is a good boy.
[3:31:46] <Profmcstevie> Whenever there is not emlo, we must ask "where emlo"
[3:31:57] <%Blank9> dogs can't look up so the cat is invisible

[3:32:04] <digimonda> yo among us

[3:32:12] <%tank7013> Shouldn't have been drinking water just then LUL
[3:32:15] <%Nordguy> get a 240p webcam for up on the kitty spire
[3:32:30] <akitanito> weird that they are only giving you the tutorial tip now
[3:33:12] <tanarath> Ye, it's kinda dumb
[3:33:13] <@Ranryu692> the only disadvantage is visual
[3:33:25] <%StephanieSadGirl> its Arkham detective vision
[3:33:25] <akitanito> everything being blue is I guess
[3:33:33] <Sparda_blizzard> Im playing the game rn, and ye i agree its kinda weird
[3:33:37] <outsidedoubtside> Did anyone bring up the Carrie Fisher cameo when Pat was playing the base game?
[3:33:57] <+King9k> I assumed it would drain mana when I first played
[3:34:07] <+tj_timbs> I never liked that either. How should it work then do you think?
[3:34:43] <akitanito> I think if mana doesn't recover while on, it could work
[3:34:52] <+tj_timbs> way to give him a lil scare before slicing his neck
[3:35:02] <auraoftheearth009> Drains life if on too long
[3:35:09] <Profmcstevie> Detective vision is lame, a pulse to see things highlighted is always cooler
[3:35:12] <sungiant_> dont they do that in 2
[3:35:15] <SocialMisfitGamer> Arkham Game did it so good tho
[3:35:18] <akitanito> Just don't hide shit
[3:35:33] <+polothegreatest> batman? best games
[3:35:44] <ape_hawk> its also just a toggle, pat
[3:35:56] <247psi> dude, pulse to see clues is awesome. like metroid dread did it was awesome
[3:35:58] <outsidedoubtside> I feel like that started in earnest when AssCreed did Eagle Vision
[3:36:01] <%StephanieSadGirl> It SHOULDNT change the graphics, if you spend the points to unlock it, just have it highlight stuff in the environment
[3:36:08] <Profmcstevie> Lets hope rocksteady keep up that string of "pretty good" games
[3:36:15] <%HotSauceFiend> those riddler puzzles are a pain and made me crazy at one point
[3:36:16] <SocialMisfitGamer> Does anyone here like Origins besides me? cuz i still like that game
[3:36:19] <CunnymobileBrakeFluid> the only way to fix that is to make a stealth game where all the walls are made of glass
[3:36:30] <+PrimalDweeb> Makes it look and sound like shit
[3:36:37] <+tj_timbs> There's a different variant of that power in Dishonored DOTO that's not as intrusive as Dark Vision, and it allows you to mark stuff
[3:36:39] <Shwepie> Why put realistic context clues or other things to help guide and inform the player when they can turn on What-The-Fuck-Are-The-Devs-Thinking Vision?
[3:36:41] <akitanito> goodies
[3:36:45] <Treasure_Vault> @CunnymobileBrakeFluid Panopticon Breakout
[3:36:54] <%JoshManVGH> Deus Ex HR got a little closer to ok with it. The game had that piss filter. and Detective Vision was a slightly pissy-er filter, so it was a little closer to regular vision.
[3:37:10] <+polothegreatest> the ridler trophys are the reason i replay the batmans LUL
[3:37:44] <sungiant_> it finally happened, after what happened last night
[3:38:07] <%HotSauceFiend> wouldnt the person whos ass is getting kissed like it in some cases
[3:38:12] <Profmcstevie> I dunno, I got a lot of ass to kiss here
[3:38:13] <%JoshManVGH> I bet if you modded this darkvision to not blue-shift, it would look great
[3:38:18] <SocialMisfitGamer> Asses that are kissed can also be kicked
[3:38:28] <%RealThiele> CEOs do
[3:38:31] <+tj_timbs> The devs like to hide coins in the most random fuckshit places that no person would ever conceivably think to look in this game
[3:38:32] <+ThomasOfTroy> Yeah, eating ass is nasty
[3:38:33] <+matf8> kill him for ass-kissing
[3:38:35] <ape_hawk> pat, shills are just one-time kiss-asses
[3:38:36] <akitanito> hurr
[3:38:37] <slix3431> You're not the greatest Pat
[3:38:39] <%GustauveVIII> use the smart person word: sycophant
[3:38:41] <+tj_timbs> without Dark Vision of course
[3:38:47] <%twistedj3ster> fine I won't then
[3:38:49] <Treasure_Vault> Pat you're really very
[3:38:58] <+RowenCleric> Pat is the greatest empreg ever
[3:39:00] <$FriedMattato> You're so right Pat. I ALSO hate kiss-asses. You're just the best to call them out
[3:39:01] <DXLelouch24> Pat prefers if you shit all over him, thats why he likes Asuka from EVA
[3:39:03] <Profmcstevie> Then in respect of that, fuck you pat you suck I guess
[3:39:13] <Treasure_Vault> Pat is the father of all mpreg
[3:39:17] <slix3431> Isn't Asuka 11?

[3:51:20] <+PrimalDweeb> Yeah, seems like it was a worthwhile investment.
[3:51:30] <+maffblunge> there's a mod that changes the sound effect for stop time to Zah Worldo sound
[3:52:13] <marsnbars> i guess uh. using already dead bodies IS still nonlethal
[3:52:29] <sungiant_> daud is a good teacher
[3:52:35] <+maffblunge> Daud shares his powers with his assassin's
[3:52:35] <asylumkon> the assassin's powers all come from daud

[3:53:58] <%VentWilsn> tbf, i also forgot about whussy until someone in-game said "this smells like whale blood" zyzxOhNo
[3:54:09] <jorniev> how did pat like the dlc?
[3:54:30] <%shootbang_exe> has pat said whether he plans to play the sequel and death of the outsider?

[4:07:56] <%maenos2> i'd argue gief is an odorous sac anyway, he's sac-shaped vaguely and god knows he's odorous
[4:07:56] <%StephanieSadGirl> Pat's sack is onl odorous when he is the mpreg
[4:07:57] <%barrakuta371> Z targetable odourless sac
[4:07:57] <ape_hawk> nah, youre the whole thing
[4:08:01] <%tank7013> Zangief is an odouress sack and we love him
[4:08:01] <+matf8> gief's also an odorous sack
[4:08:06] <%cvp5127> some kind of mpreg
[4:08:06] <Treasure_Vault> Save
[4:08:16] <churropoppa> oudoress sac = whussy

[4:09:24] <akitanito> how
[4:09:27] <%VentWilsn> so whats the difference between the two blinks?

[4:09:36] <+flamestream89> dumbwaiter life
[4:09:36] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat Lord Regant Hiram Burrows is voiced by Kristoffer Tabori, AKA HK-47. So super evil!

[4:10:01] <%cartakus> HK is a good boi
[4:10:25] <%SWFanatic> HK isn't evil, he was programmed that way
[4:10:29] <Kief_Meister> @PatStaresAt Hey, don't know if you brought it up on the podcast but did you see Crowbcats new video on Back 4 Blood??
[4:10:29] <Laecerelius> Uh-oh!  Stinky!
[4:10:46] <jtsoppy137> cuz the stink
[4:10:52] <+NopeBadguy> arrested by death

[4:11:25] <Kief_Meister> WHEN THAT WHUSSY STANK LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:11:28] <%JoshManVGH> Letting the Weeper Stank out
[4:11:29] <Neo_Kaiser> Back 4 Blood just fell off the Earth when it came out.
[4:11:43] <Kief_Meister> This is a true fact
[4:11:52] <%cartakus> F
[4:11:59] <Kief_Meister> I played the beta, guns felt clunky, let the beta leave and fall off.
[4:12:09] <HeroToxiko> tfw surprise eviction
[4:12:11] <+flamestream89> bye bye arnie
[4:12:21] <SaltyAzteca> A MONTH of WHUSSY
[4:12:23] <DXLelouch24> now kill him for funsies Pat
[4:12:30] <jorniev> cops being assholes
[4:12:34] <akitanito> stupid PSA taking over subtitles
[4:12:52] <%VentWilsn> i would prob still play back 4 blood even after seeing the crowbat vid but its funny that one of my ex friends said that back 4 blood was superior to left 4 dead in every way
[4:12:58] <%Taisuru> psaDogchamp
[4:12:59] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @akitanito The worst thing about the game in my eyes.
[4:13:04] <huskarl_zap> rune Deez nuts
[4:13:07] <%VentWilsn> and he only played it for 3 days
[4:13:22] <akitanito> check a guide?
[4:13:24] <+NopeBadguy> what if the last rune was the friends we made along the way
[4:13:29] <akitanito> what?
[4:13:30] <%cartakus> Oh
[4:13:30] <Laecerelius> YEAH!
[4:13:33] <ape_hawk> oh, this is gonna be a terrible idea
[4:13:33] <%JoshManVGH> Uh
[4:13:34] <Kief_Meister> @VentWilsn Yeah my friend played the beta and had the audacity to lie to my face and say it was better then left 4 dead lmao
[4:13:34] <%SWFanatic> F legs
[4:13:37] <+maffblunge> @huskarl_zap o fuk
[4:13:57] <+NopeBadguy> FUCK it
[4:14:05] <ape_hawk> pat, slow time stops when you swap abilities
[4:14:07] <+flamestream89> the ol jessamine special
[4:14:13] <Afterman_> is there a basement? hidden under the basement?
[4:14:36] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Maybe the real runes were the friends we made along the way.
[4:14:36] <%SWFanatic> ur butt heh
[4:14:36] <akitanito> you ain't gettig it
[4:14:37] <Treasure_Vault> Is this the granny rags bit?
[4:14:42] <%cartakus> at the beggining with your luck
[4:15:01] <%VentWilsn> @Kief_Meister yea like even tho i didnt play the game, u cant just state a hot take like that and then walk away
[4:15:05] <%bevyrage> don't you use the heart to make it appear
[4:15:23] <Treasure_Vault> I think you gotta take a tarot card from Timsh house and sidequest
[4:15:27] <%bevyrage> darkvision lets you see it when you're close enough but the heart lets you see where it is at all
[4:15:27] <Treasure_Vault> Not 100%
[4:16:15] <%SWFanatic> psaBig psaDogchamp
[4:16:16] <%Taisuru> psaDogchamp
[4:16:18] <DeltaPangaea> Daud doesn't have his dead waifu's heart to tell him where to go.
[4:16:23] <huskarl_zap> probably the sidequest reward
[4:16:27] <akitanito> just two more bodies
[4:16:30] <%NopeBadguy> NopeBadguy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 34 months! Hey, Pat! Appreciate the stream as always, bummed out since we lost our raid day due to a 90k into a 1.5k queue; so this is a nice consolation prize. What's next for big projects after Dishonored?
[4:16:54] <Treasure_Vault> I'm pretty sure the rune is part of a sidequest. Find a tarot card in timsh house.
[4:17:16] <bloobualz> you guys made me unalive you, please apologize
[4:17:43] <akitanito> yep
[4:17:45] <Zombrocom> Oh yeah, did you find the tarot card?
[4:17:45] <%cartakus> I wonder if a type of game like this but in third person would work. The only new game with most likely thief format is the gollum game
[4:17:53] <northern18> i think its connected to a granny recipe? so its not on the map
[4:17:59] <akitanito> just forget it man
[4:18:05] <%The_0_2_Hero> I feel like these monochrome vision things never work out well
[4:18:34] <Treasure_Vault> Run it back and be mad anyway.
[4:18:34] <%SWFanatic> Who would win? Pat Orb VS Zangief Chonk?
[4:18:39] <slipdog> @cartakus styx?
[4:18:40] <%The_0_2_Hero> The heart didn't turn everything blue
[4:18:43] <sungiant_> the lil lore tidbits are very poggies
[4:18:45] <%The_0_2_Hero> Or cost mana
[4:18:48] <akitanito> I won't mind the heart so much if it  didn't occupy your power slot
[4:18:56] <Treasure_Vault> I wouldn't mind being able to replay a level in speedrun mode to get the missing stuff.
[4:19:04] <ape_hawk> pretty sure if daud had the heart, it would just tell him to eat shit
[4:19:08] <+maffblunge> they made the heart better in 2
[4:19:11] <%cartakus> @slipdog I guess
[4:19:15] <%tank7013> Doing a spinaroonie across the whole map just to find a rune
[4:19:21] <slipdog> LUL
[4:19:26] <+tj_timbs> Dishonored DOTO has a neat take on this power

[4:20:55] <%Taisuru> I love you Pasta Rat
[4:20:57] <DeltaPangaea> Pastarat is one of my favorite things.
[4:20:57] <%Nekros4442> lol
[4:21:08] <akitanito> pastarat is if you can't read
[4:21:10] <@Ranryu692> @huskarl_zap Pat raided Nyanners one day and she misread his name as Pasta Rat
[4:21:14] <DeltaPangaea> When do we get pat drawn as a ratman
[4:21:15] <%cartakus> Pasta with rats
[4:21:26] <goshdangjoe> nah man throw some dreads on our boy here and it's rasta pat
[4:21:27] <%VentWilsn> @huskarl_zap lmao
[4:21:31] <DeltaPangaea> Hasn't vinny misread it as pastarat like, multiple times too?
[4:21:31] <+polothegreatest> LUL LUL LUL

[4:21:58] <Archmortal> don't let the goblin win!
[4:21:59] <ape_hawk> good night, pat and chat
[4:22:00] <Treasure_Vault> wow, lots of missing coins.
[4:22:04] <%cartakus> Smort
[4:22:08] <+King9k> Are you gonna get the other 1000 coins though lol
[4:22:09] <Treasure_Vault> That's a lot of money left on the table.
[4:22:10] <%StephanieSadGirl> Pat has to go so Paige can make him the Mpreg
[4:22:17] <+matf8> are you going to play more of it on stream?
[4:22:27] <%cartakus> why 3000 coins?
[4:22:28] <TurtlesAndTentacles> got any recommendations for nursing heavy back pain?
[4:23:00] <akitanito> no heart really makes finding stuff suck

[4:23:42] <bamberfool> WutFace
[4:23:43] <%SaiyanShoto> Dogs licking feet is a sign that they respect you
[4:23:44] <akitanito> smelly feet
[4:23:45] <SaltyAzteca> Cultured gief
[4:23:53] <HeroToxiko> yeah thats a dog thing, they're trynna clean you
[4:23:55] <DeltaPangaea> Oh god, gief is a foot guy
[4:23:56] <%tank7013> Zangief has horrible fetishes just like his mommy
[4:23:59] <%Taisuru> This is somehow Reggie's fault
[4:24:03] <digimonda> the dog is becoming a japanese hentai artist
[4:24:12] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @swfanatic the doctor gave me Valium and 600 MG Ibuprofen and they aren't helping,granting it's been a day and a half. omma try to stretch

[4:24:53] <@Ranryu692> Dishonored 2 has some really cool levels that are worth seeing!
[4:24:54] <%cartakus> I wonder if gief can read orders with just the lips
[4:24:59] <%SWFanatic> @TurtlesAndTentacles valium? If muscles are tense/spasm ask for muscle relaxant. Valium might help you sleep, but its for anxiety.
[4:25:27] <+King9k> Yeah D2 has
[4:25:28] <%cartakus> He fat
[4:25:29] <+Luna_Lux9> Zangief cuddly boy!
[4:25:33] <%IamGrapes> IamGrapes subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! a two year subbing! give doo doo a big hug for me! hope you and Paige have a fantastic new year!
[4:25:38] <%SWFanatic> @TurtlesAndTentacles It'll take time, pain won't go away with meds, should just make it more tolerable
[4:25:40] <%The_0_2_Hero> Definitely recommend playing as Emily in 2, she's super fun

[4:26:07] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @swfanatic they said it was suppose to relax my muscles...dammit. so I just have to rest and be careful
[4:26:10] <+polothegreatest> LUL LUL
[4:26:15] <%cartakus> Weak
[4:26:21] <%JoshManVGH> Comically and hilariously dead?
[4:26:27] <akitanito> a different kind of goblin
[4:26:39] <@Ranryu692> yeah, that's pretty standard
[4:26:40] <%MidnightBurst12> that sounds like normal goblins
[4:26:45] <Treasure_Vault> Yeah, gotta rune up
[4:26:55] <%SWFanatic> @TurtlesAndTentacles it'll relax you, but I'd prefer muscle relaxants rather than anti-anxiety meds for muscular strains
[4:27:01] <%cartakus> Cthulhu
[4:27:09] <%JoshManVGH> Aww that's kinda sweet
[4:27:10] <$SGrim> Slime
