[0:48:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat Don't forget that as you get the cats to go to the cat cafe you can go and see them.
[0:48:18] <%StuffNFluff> gotta bump em all
[0:48:22] <fIashman92> How much stronger did this grinding make you?
[0:48:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I kinda figured Pat would look up how to EXP fast
[0:48:22] <+Tarheelg23> Someone test Kiryu's piss
[0:48:27] <arcaderabbit48> Is this Pat's work out video debut as part of his new partnership with Rooster Teeth(TM)
[0:48:35] <@lewdskeletor13> Do you get to fight the cats?
[0:48:46] <rumuloh> Pat ate plastic sushi
[0:48:51] <ShichiNoBushi> What's your favorite sushi, and what's the weirdest sushi you have eaten?
[0:48:52] <$vincerocmm> the cube
[0:48:56] <%manwithboxonhead> Are you fighting your own Yakuza?
[0:48:59] <+JavaManJoJo> I've only had very american sushi, any good ones to try chat?
[0:49:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @lewdskeletor13 Yes but it's a battle of wills not muscles
[0:49:04] <$bootysteve> How are people not just shitting themselves and running away immediately when they see Kiryu at this point
[0:49:05] <takiyami> @Too_Much_Nukie I work at a sushi restaurant, I get free sushi all the time! Most places should have something like a Fire Dragon roll, I would start there. Salmon and Tuna are basic but taste great.
[0:49:08] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> christ pat...
[0:49:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> This is the Minh grind
[0:49:22] <@lewdskeletor13> @manwithboxonhead Kiryu isn’t in the Yakuza he hates the Yakuza Kappa

[0:50:46] <pinapplelee> kiwami means cheat
[0:50:47] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Because you dont get EXP if your full, so you need the burners to lower digestion
[0:50:47] <Shin_true92> Grinding is better on the next idl
[0:50:52] <%Laecerelius> Drink your juice, Kiryu!
[0:50:53] <+Tarheelg23> @omen_setter Great minds think alike
[0:50:54] <zerocruz> If only it were so easy in real life
[0:50:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> So yoy can eat more meaning more EXP

[0:51:19] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat This is how Deep Ones are made
[0:51:20] <+dukenux> How did Kiryu not poop his pants yet
[0:51:21] <PortableBoredom> Alternatively, you could just play the game and get thousands of all EXP and not do any of this shit.
[0:51:24] <+thepretenderking> Kiryu is about to DESTROY Tojo HQ's toilet
[0:51:24] <arcaderabbit48> Wow. It makes sense in context, but this is super creepy. Kiryu must eat more, so he purges with calorie juice. MORE FISH
[0:51:25] <+Mr_Pylon> Seek-Lest-Kiwami-Kiwami-Kiwami
[0:51:27] <InugamiTheHound> oh man Kiryu must have so many parasites from that sushi

[0:52:46] <KeiPrime> i think the first cutscene is in kamurocho tho, but the thing starts for real there

[0:54:46] <%NopeBadguy> did you get all the boost combat speed skills already? @AngriestPat
[0:54:47] <+dukenux> Boosting xp gain seems like an obvious choice with system like this
[0:54:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @theneojames82 It actually is, it's just also insanely dangerous and you'll die.
[0:54:52] <%NopeBadguy> oh nvm that answers that

[1:01:52] <+dukenux> I want to be a white clerk that annoys locals with his shitty accent
[1:01:53] <SeventyForce> No, it's just yer regular p-idol stuff
[1:01:54] <red_blaster> The tonkatsu bento is for a sidequest in another chapter, but you want to buy it now

[1:02:54] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat So you can't play the Fox Engine remaster of MGS3?
[1:02:57] <SkreamnR3dSkull> Imagine a whole arc of this game is Kiryu being shamed for knocking over everyone's bike's
[1:03:01] <LegendaryDorkKnight> kaiji ultimate survivor has the best pachinko thing ever
[1:03:04] <starotter70> YE YE YE

[1:04:24] <+dukenux> He didn't like that table anyway
[1:04:25] <%StuffNFluff> although I know the series is well revered
[1:04:26] <%Over_ninek> what a great bar
[1:04:27] <KeiPrime> bantam has seen a lot over the years
[1:04:28] <BoneofMalkav> Kiryu has never killed a man.
[1:04:29] <%nofestu2> Kiriu never killed nobody
[1:04:29] <%XzileGaming> HIBIKI CHAN
[1:04:30] <KeiPrime> this is normal
[1:04:34] <PortableBoredom> He doesn't know
[1:04:34] <starotter70> Time to get WASTED and play Darts

[1:04:42] <%StuffNFluff> kinda reminds me of Shenmue, to a point
[1:04:46] <ScreamingMeat> Kiwami means Liver Failure
[1:04:46] <InugamiTheHound> Japanese whiskey is best in the world
[1:04:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Are you gonna refuse the man who just took out 5 Yakuza in hand-to-hand combat?
[1:04:48] <@lewdskeletor13> @stuffnfluff It’s really fun. It goes from serious to super goofy really fast.

[1:04:54] <+dukenux> He doesn't look very wasted
[1:04:57] <%Over_ninek> i dont believe Kiryu is capable of getting wasted
[1:04:59] <hassanico> @StuffNFluff The comparison gets made often, but you have more freedom and better combat here
[1:05:00] <%spiritofmojave> Drinking makes you stronger is a good philosophy this game promotes
[1:05:00] <%nitronLVIII> Kiwami means getting wasted before noon
[1:05:00] <%shiplord13> Its never enough
[1:05:02] <%NWR_James> Kiwami means get fucked up and play darts

[1:05:46] <GreyHeartedHero> There was a prompt to bring up the rules
[1:05:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Count-Up is the one where you just try to make your number big.

[1:23:21] <+thehoboacrossts> wait actually isn't this what modern day yakuza are like?
[1:23:23] <alcors_wisdom> you really REALLY think fucking KIRYU needs protection MOTHERFUCKER CAN LIFT A FUCKING CAR
[1:23:25] <+TechnicolorNinja> Protection? for the Dragon? Pffft!
[1:23:27] <+Th3SmartAlec> TIGER DROP THEM
[1:23:27] <person181> wait till you see their backs
[1:23:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> when majima's not on screen, everyone should be asking--
[1:23:29] <omen_setter> no one has cut off a single finger since business took over. shit sucks
[1:23:29] <cerberuscarmine> yeee pat is huge rooster teeth now
[1:23:29] <r_Foeburden87> call them bitches out
[1:23:31] <%Divryne> I'll never forgive the Chinese.
[1:23:32] <hassanico> We have always been at war with CHina.
[1:23:33] <%Divryne> LUL
[1:23:33] <+mrshazboto> Someone clip that for Crazy Talk?
[1:23:34] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[1:23:35] <primarch_lupercal> yakuza tropes LUL
[1:23:36] <dheng1> Freeza
[1:23:37] <+dukenux> Oh right, the war.
[1:23:38] <%TheHandsomeKat> Old man chairman is like, money buy more honor
[1:23:40] <ミュウレ4242> they aren't even tigers. repeating knee.
[1:23:41] <R3c0n31> Both might as well be Freeza and Dio, so obviously gonna take their shirts off later
[1:23:45] <+tigerfang86> Strong character and STRONGER ARMS
[1:23:47] <a_mad_dragon> "character"
[1:23:49] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat They are going to claim its the Chinese or something to direct Kiryu as a weapon against them.
[1:23:53] <+Mr_Pylon> I love how much Kiryu knows these guys are full of shit
[1:23:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @GrumpMic 『Crazy Talk』 is already Pat's canon stand
[1:23:58] <hassanico> @R3c0n31 Dio was in Kiwami 2 actually
[1:23:59] <hntronium> Strong character and stronger fists
[1:23:59] <%ThePuddingDead> so is he basically Skullface of Yakuza? @AngriestPat
[1:23:59] <alcors_wisdom> no shit dumbass
[1:23:59] <Dehlome> hes like the strongest man in the world at this point
[1:24:06] <pinapplelee> it’s them
[1:24:07] <falconx9k> Point me in a direction and my fists will do the rest
[1:24:07] <alexandrecau> Someya knows where it's at
[1:24:08] <televisedrevolting> @thehoboacrossts Yes, that is the thing they represent, yes.
[1:24:09] <Capn_Bilge> even when sugai's not smiling, you can totally see him smiling...
[1:24:10] <+Spec7re> Both of these guys are going to get it super hard
[1:24:10] <+skizzuto> just popped into the stream, what've I missed so far?
[1:24:14] <+Deano8817> also, would that mean that's frieza's VA's real actor face since yakuza does that?
[1:24:19] <maverickdrifter> It’s incredible how people think they can pull one over on kiryu. Like not only from his power alone but like he is the man of kamurocho in terms of just helping people and forming bonds
[1:24:19] <+tigerfang86> what a nice guy
[1:24:20] <bearwagon> fuck this guy
[1:24:22] <alcors_wisdom> fuck off
[1:24:22] <%Kataguro> What a STUPID thing to say, wow
[1:24:22] <+griffball13> you are nothing to me
[1:24:23] <%skizzuto> skizzuto subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[1:24:24] <%AbnormalVoid> man, he's going to eat a fist
[1:24:25] <fearhurst> trAIDS
[1:24:26] <StromkoPenguin> We didn't want you anyway, baka
[1:24:26] <maverickdrifter> He’s Golden Boy but yakuza
[1:24:27] <%PlainSimpleTailor> What??? Haruka's DEAD?
[1:24:29] <xvedll> @xvedll is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[1:24:29] <%NWR_James> This is Kiryu's 6th round of this crap, he's basically spent more of his life dealing with these things than anything
[1:24:29] <%Solidnick18> no
[1:24:32] <omen_setter> his tie is distracting
[1:24:33] <+tigerfang86> he can LITERALLY stomp your head off
[1:24:33] <%Laecerelius> They're definitely gonna try to use Kiryu as a weapon against the Triad
[1:24:34] <GrumpMic> ohhhh ok @Valentinius_Anodyne
[1:24:34] <hntronium> This man knows nothing
[1:24:34] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Then WHY WATCH HIM
[1:24:36] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Hes like 18 sono
[1:24:36] <+dukenux> And then Kiryu goes to the Triad and they're like "WHO?"
[1:24:37] <+BoomerTiro> Plot twist, Haruka ran haruka over through time travel to maintain a stable time loop
[1:24:37] <starotter70> Apparently not
[1:24:38] <+Th3SmartAlec> Kiryu's personally affected 10-s of thousands of people's lives
[1:24:38] <person181> he's the FUCKING DRAGON OF DOJIMA you have no value to HIM
[1:24:38] <alexandrecau> Young prick
[1:24:39] <R3c0n31> @hassanico Havent played it, yet.
[1:24:39] <%shiplord13> No he was 15
[1:24:39] <%spiritofmojave> I like how Triads and Koreans are always insanely evil in this goddamn series
[1:24:40] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat Kiryu was in jail for 10 yeards
[1:24:41] <arcaderabbit48> Kiryu is a fucking force of nature
[1:24:44] <$cureneckbeard> All this talk of Chinese makes me hungry
[1:24:44] <%MagickBurritoh> Kiryu is a living legend
[1:24:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Kiryu never killed anyone
[1:24:45] <%Kataguro> This smug man needs to go
[1:24:47] <+bear_breaker20> Kiryu is such a old man now
[1:24:48] <outis94> kiryu survived rocket blasts right?
[1:24:49] <%spacedroner1> "Fuckin' kids get off my lawn" -Kiryu probably
[1:24:49] <%weissguard> This guy is one sneaky fuck. Just you wait.
[1:24:50] <+dukenux> but by that time Kiryu will already beat up most of them
[1:24:50] <@lewdskeletor13> Biiiiiiitch
[1:24:51] <+Th3SmartAlec> @king_wragles 10 yards
[1:24:53] <falconx9k> This motherfucker
[1:24:54] <arcaderabbit48> They are trying to tempt a hurricane, and strong arm a tornado
[1:24:56] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> How can you be cocky? You're getting your ass kicked by the Chinese?
[1:24:56] <+Spec7re> Kiryu the dragon of dojima is NO LONGER A THREAT
[1:24:57] <%king_wragles> OOOHHHH
[1:24:57] <hassanico> @R3c0n31 It's a minor role in an optional story but you can tell it's his VA immediately
[1:24:57] <+SaltySombrero> "Hey buddy I ever tell you that I beat my way out of this very building more than TWICE in my life time and lived"
[1:24:59] <%Dementedpenguin> Look at this new guy huffin' and puffin' in front of Kiryu LUL
[1:25:00] <%weissguard> He'll pull some stupid shit.
[1:25:02] <%manwithboxonhead> Oh shit
[1:25:06] <%weissguard> ***Probably.
[1:25:06] <alexandrecau> Majima very intelligent
[1:25:09] <Dehlome> jail just made him even more jacked
[1:25:10] <sphereshots12> He could have heard about
[1:25:13] <Mangoesarentcats> and kiryu CAN
[1:25:17] <GrumpMic> well in that case @AngriestPat who from any of the Yakuza series would be your Stand? lmfao
[1:25:21] <%Kataguro> But Kiryu has beaten up literally everyone three times
[1:25:22] <%MagickBurritoh> Kiryu can fucking FIGHT
[1:25:23] <person181> but what if a man is worth 100 more
[1:25:27] <hntronium> This guy is an idiot
[1:25:28] <%nitronLVIII> Hasnt Kiryu basically beaten the shit out of all the former Yakuza leadership
[1:25:28] <+Th3SmartAlec> And since you've never killed anyone...
[1:25:29] <alexandrecau> Someya basically says he kills
[1:25:30] <+Shaggnar> Why would anyone challenge Kiyru at this point? He's literally just going to punch anyone in his way until they aren't in his way anymore
[1:25:32] <+tigerfang86> what a chump
[1:25:33] <+miguelrod777> man who fought an army of goons
[1:25:33] <a_mad_dragon> this guy is TOTALLY working with the triads
[1:25:34] <%shiplord13> You are the strongest Yakuza and we need you to help us win
[1:25:35] <+Mr_Pylon> All that matters is fighting skill, that's why we don't care about KIRYU
[1:25:35] <+griffball13> yaaaa he did
[1:25:36] <arcaderabbit48> Kiryu's body count is in the thousands!
[1:25:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> It's $50, excuse you
[1:25:36] <+dukenux> Kiryu is the ULTimate BIOweapn
[1:25:36] <+mrshazboto> This LITERAL CHILD is talking to the Yakuza equivalent of Kratos
[1:25:37] <Xeno351> they think he's old now and can only not kill 900 men instead of a 100 LUL
[1:25:40] <+Th3SmartAlec> HE DIDNT RISE TO POWER
[1:25:43] <starotter70> But Kiryu hasn't killed anyone
[1:25:46] <%spacedroner1> If you're such hot shit young yakuza guy crush this rock with your bare hands
[1:25:48] <%LouieRouie> Such an ugly tablecloth
[1:25:49] <$cureneckbeard> Kiryu has never killed anyone
[1:25:52] <primarch_lupercal> its kylo yakuza
[1:26:00] <maverickdrifter> Actual Civilian Kazuma Kiryu
[1:26:01] <majindusto> Fuck You, its $100
[1:26:02] <+Th3SmartAlec> Kiryu: "GET ON WIITH IT"
[1:26:04] <alcors_wisdom> "your value is based on your body count" and "you have no value to us" makes no sense talking to kiryu who has FOUGHT THE ENTIRE CLAN IN A SINGLE DAY
[1:26:04] <SonicTheHedgeog> so if it's by body count wouldn't kiriyu be a god to them
[1:26:09] <HoIlywood_SN> Kiryu fucking annihilated like 9 million people why are you talking to him like this
[1:26:09] <+stupid_neko21> he's also talking about the new generation...but like...he looks 5 years younger...
[1:26:12] <televisedrevolting> Are they just saying "Might=Right"?
[1:26:15] <+Th3SmartAlec> @alcors_wisdom SEVERAL TIMES
[1:26:20] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> You're bitches. Bitches do stupid stuff.
[1:26:22] <+dukenux> DONT
[1:26:26] <%Kataguro> Let's fuck around with the WALKING NUKE
[1:26:29] <R3tr0R3dux> uptime!

[1:26:43] <%weissguard> YEYEYEYEYE
[1:26:43] <ItsDeans> This universe confuses me sometimes. Kriyu is obviously a legend and has a track record of winning in seemingly impossible situations. So what makes these people think they'll be the one who does it?
[1:26:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> again\
[1:26:44] <%Solidnick18> or maybe he does
[1:26:44] <%StuffNFluff> WEW
[1:26:44] <omen_setter> but THIS time it will be different
[1:26:44] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Maybe they think he still can't afford a tie.
[1:26:44] <+Toppunchpoopbob> monkaS
[1:26:45] <%Dementedpenguin> Damn.
[1:26:46] <%Thalchampz> god damn

[1:26:51] <indig0bird> And he can back it up
[1:26:52] <%ThePuddingDead> spoken threat established
[1:26:52] <bigbradish> Kiryu is so fucking cool
[1:26:53] <+dukenux> Because Yakuzies are idiots that are all aobut hierarchy
[1:26:54] <pinapplelee> yyaaaaasss
[1:26:54] <%Solidnick18> OH
[1:26:54] <hntronium> KILL
[1:26:54] <%spacedroner1> The limiters are off now boys
[1:26:54] <Caidezes> Don't fuck with his daughter.
[1:26:55] <%Laecerelius> I will murder all of you AGAIN. FOR THE LIKE TENTH TIME.
[1:26:55] <starotter70> Probably
[1:26:56] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat If they all get their own cube then Kiryu could never touch them
[1:26:56] <@lewdskeletor13> WutFace
[1:26:57] <%Gatzarlok> Kiryu is tired man, just let him rest jesus
[1:26:57] <alcors_wisdom> thats his first death threat yeah
[1:26:59] <+mrshazboto> So when do we kill this actual child?
[1:26:59] <+Th3SmartAlec> KILL THEM ALL
[1:26:59] <$D4C_Trice> This man has dodged an RPG, you can't touch him.
[1:26:59] <%Solidnick18> he gonna do it
[1:26:59] <ExemplarKyle> The same reason that nameless jobbers still don't recognize him on the streets and pick fights with him: REASONS.
[1:27:00] <R3c0n31> He is legit mad
[1:27:00] <maverickdrifter> My dad is tired
[1:27:00] <silvcrest> Yakuza 0 to Kuze
[1:27:01] <%NWR_James> Remember, the plots of Yakuza 2, 4, 5, and 6 would all be "bad guys win" if they didn't get Kiryu involved
[1:27:01] <disflipmat> Didn't he say he was gonna bury the Tojo Clan in Y0?
[1:27:02] <%spiritofmojave> That's because he doesn't threaten, he just fucking does
[1:27:04] <%manwithboxonhead> Bury you ALIVE!!!
[1:27:05] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat he did the same in zero when tachibana died
[1:27:07] <+Toppunchpoopbob> 8 games if you include Dead Souls Kappa
[1:27:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> Kiryu is John Wick. Don't fuck with him.
[1:27:10] <pinapplelee> dad rage
[1:27:11] <person181> Kiryu is FUCKING PISSED so of couse he would be blunt
[1:27:13] <%weissguard> PLAYTHINGS? Kiryu could benchpress this guy. LUL
[1:27:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Caidezes his daughter fucks
[1:27:16] <alcors_wisdom> LITERALLY THOUSANDS
[1:27:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kiryu has never killed anybody, but you might be the first
[1:27:17] <%TDotGoat> everyone who crosses Kiryu ends up dead, so no one knows you don't cross Kiryu
[1:27:18] <+tigerfang86> WTF PAT
[1:27:19] <%Kataguro> Kiryu will do a heat move on the cube
[1:27:19] <SilverFaustX> 8 , dead souls Kappa

[1:27:27] <Ion_Laser> :D
[1:27:27] <+Promessa_EX> wont hold anything back is what he said, ie kill
[1:27:29] <%AbnormalVoid> "I've been doing nothing but kicking ass since I got out of jail, don't fuck with me"
[1:27:29] <ItsDeans> Dude, he has fought a fucking TIGER!
[1:27:29] <+dukenux> It's safe in the Gamer Cube

[1:27:32] <simulationbard> I love how aware Kiryu is that he could single handedly destroy the Tojo
[1:27:32] <+mrshazboto> That's gotta be one of the fuckiest things you've said
[1:27:33] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat can the cube overcome the power of GUN though?
[1:27:34] <fearhurst> Kiryu will drag a car in there and lay it on him
[1:27:35] <%ouroborowski> the time cube?
[1:27:35] <%NWR_James> only stupid asshole sit in this box

[1:29:38] <%rdark_ksu> hi shittier kiddo
[1:29:38] <televisedrevolting> @valriot So Kiryu's codename is Dragon right?
[1:29:39] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat He has a really nice suit.
[1:29:41] <@commanderclaw> Kiryu's only 6 feet tall
[1:29:42] <$cureneckbeard> Goons Everywhere System
[1:29:42] <%spiritofmojave> Not even 50's LUL
[1:29:44] <BoneofMalkav> Guys form New Japan Pro Wrestling
[1:29:45] <MalignantUpper> hubris
[1:29:46] <outis94> early 50s
[1:29:48] <+dukenux> Why isn't Kiryu a Kamurocho urban legentd at this point?
[1:29:49] <+stupid_neko21> but he's OOOLLLDDDD..
[1:29:49] <starotter70> Perfect Bait
[1:29:49] <%NWR_James> a 30-year old criminial suit
[1:29:50] <cerberuscarmine> hes also known by everyone
[1:29:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> I still go by the "Initiation" theory
[1:29:55] <+tigerfang86> that's what HAPPUN
[1:29:55] <+Th3SmartAlec> The town has to know something
[1:29:59] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> 2 of them stopped
[1:30:01] <Dehlome> only badasses wear white suits as theyre everyday outfit
[1:30:01] <cerberuscarmine> as the dragon of dojima

[1:30:03] <+Th3SmartAlec> DEAD
[1:30:04] <Graywolf_the_45th> because a dumb suit like that would make you assume he's rich

[1:30:09] <cerberuscarmine> LOL
[1:30:09] <%templar010> FIFTY FEET
[1:30:10] <+SaltySombrero> Kiryu's probably thinking that this new generation of shakedowns are weak shit
[1:30:10] <ShichiNoBushi> Isn't it an initiation that new gang members mess with the guy in the white suit?
[1:30:10] <+megabman> DEAD
[1:30:10] <+frugglemeister> Kiryu stop
[1:30:10] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> He's fine. No deaths here.
[1:30:11] <%Gatzarlok> Not to mention over how many years, they would have to be SOME kind or rumor or picture of Kiryu that says "Don't fuck with"
[1:30:11] <Ion_Laser> :D
[1:30:11] <+Deano8817> he's fine
[1:30:11] <%Dementedpenguin> He's fiinnnneeeee
[1:30:12] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> remember in canon that old thugs and punks trick new guys into fighting Kiryu as a right of passage. Kiryu is a walking hazing hazard

[1:33:22] <majindusto> JUSTIS
[1:33:22] <person181> max char
[1:33:24] <+bear_breaker20> We just got thru talking about how evil these business men were
[1:33:26] <simulationbard> This sounds like a gang/cult
[1:33:28] <+Wegradeo> Kiryu: only 3000?
[1:33:28] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> .....
[1:33:29] <Dehlome> that sounds like trouble
[1:33:31] <$cureneckbeard> Over 3000 *crushes scouter*
[1:33:32] <alcors_wisdom> kiryu can and will body all 3000 member of your group if you fuck with him
[1:33:32] <Zombrocom> This is just a cult
[1:33:33] <%XzileGaming> JUNGLE BOY

[1:33:36] <+dukenux> Jungle Boy!
[1:33:38] <@lewdskeletor13> It really sounds like a cult
[1:33:38] <falconx9k> I love that the wrestlers aren't actually wrestlers in this universe. They're just WEIRDOS
[1:33:38] <a_mad_dragon> 3000 member fan club you mean
[1:33:38] <%Solidnick18> bye
[1:33:39] <+Spec7re> This literally is a cult
[1:33:40] <%manwithboxonhead> So much you have to explicitly talk about his Charisma.
[1:33:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Moon nacho
[1:33:44] <+Deano8817> I want to see kiryu vs okada in real life
[1:33:44] <starotter70> Well that happened
[1:33:45] <sosuke5> I'd drink that Kool-aid
[1:33:45] <%king_wragles> Aw man, I was hoping they'd be cool
[1:33:47] <42nfl19> What good guy ever uses the word "specimen"? @AngriestPat
[1:33:47] <Ion_Laser> :D :D :D
[1:33:48] <devanmuse> @docpepperphd Nobody has weaponized 4chan yet and there are no headless ladies in sexy catsuits riding motorcycles, tho
[1:33:48] <%stabbityrabbit> Yeah, fun fact. Gangs originally came around because no one would actually defend/police certain parts of cities. Those parts would form a gang. Eventually gangs became what they are now.
[1:33:48] <+Th3SmartAlec> ...so are you gonna fight me, or...?
[1:33:49] <starotter70> I fucking hate this place
[1:33:50] <%HiroTSK5> I feel like this guy's arms should be flailing about as he talks
[1:33:50] <$cureneckbeard> How has he never heard of this group that has 3000 people
[1:33:51] <cerberuscarmine> poor kiryu
[1:33:52] <%shiplord13> I think those guys wre fans of Bleach
[1:33:52] <%Solidnick18> seeya okada
[1:33:54] <+Walopoh> Kiryu eats 3000 men for breakfast
[1:33:55] <fruit_pie_the_magician> They just watched Kiryu knee that dudes face inside out
[1:33:55] <omen_setter> Kiryu, this place wasn't ever not nuts
[1:33:55] <cerberuscarmine> hes too old for this shit
[1:33:56] <+dukenux> Shoreh Justis
[1:33:58] <%docpepperphd> A wrestling cult is okay as far as cults go honestly
[1:33:58] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Drinking the Wool-Aid.
[1:33:59] <%templar010> Kiryu is so done with this town
[1:34:00] <%sshen> Is it using the woolaid?

[1:34:06] <%spiritofmojave> Kiryu still wondering how the fuck he keeps ending up in this weird city
[1:34:08] <%stabbityrabbit> With all that in mind, this is absolutely a gang.
[1:34:14] <+Th3SmartAlec> @starotter70 I actually like how over time Kiryu would hate this place as he's basically cursed by it
[1:34:14] <+Spec7re> Kiryu matched with Majima on Troublr
[1:34:22] <alexandrecau> enhanced
[1:34:24] <InugamiTheHound> @oAznoUta I thought it was dollars
[1:34:25] <@lewdskeletor13> Does Troubler just point out encounters?
[1:34:28] <DoubledOgre> pat reminds me of mojo from xmen with his cube
[1:34:29] <+dukenux> Half gang, half cult, half vigilante group
[1:34:29] <+Toppunchpoopbob> Essence of Reversal
[1:34:30] <pinapplelee> kiryu knows he’s gonna be the one to do everything

[2:03:52] <%President_Miyazaki> Spontaneously combusting babies? That's rad!
[2:03:53] <%rdark_ksu> did you know babies only have two eyes! and they dont grow back either
[2:03:53] <alexandrecau> right in the cloud
[2:03:54] <HeadsHeldHigh> Dont bring the kid closer to the smoke
[2:03:55] <%DarkSideCow> it drove me crazy as well haruka is his daughter and thats his grandson but he makes it seem like hes not even close to related to her which is so annoying
[2:03:55] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat You have to expose the baby young so he build up an immunity.
[2:03:56] <+DesertOfSand> That's why babies always cry. They're aware of their combustibility and they hate it
[2:03:56] <omen_setter> good thing babies are excellent swimmers
[2:03:57] <ミュウレ4242> but they burn clean, and provide 10x the energy that goes in to making them.
[2:03:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh my god
[2:03:58] <DartonLance> my pack of smokes right now actually says it may cause babies to suddenly die

[2:04:04] <+gliph13> She Could Have thought he was an uncle
[2:04:04] <%Laecerelius> IT's like poison, if you have them inhaile small amounts of second hand smoke it'll make them immune to it eventually

[2:11:52] <%WheatlyXT> That game looks really good
[2:11:54] <%shiplord13> Kiryu's entire plan: Steal the baby, then ditch it, then profit
[2:11:55] <%spiritofmojave> Imagine Kiryu going through all that trouble to baby-nap just to go fuck off and fight people forever
[2:11:55] <%Spruce_Lee_Karate_Tree> @AngriestPat go to the cemetary at night i believe.

[2:12:06] <alexandrecau> @RubberFistFight all for those delicious baby organs

[2:12:14] <+Promessa_EX> did that lady just came?
[2:12:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kiryu's idea of vacation is pretty much the same as his day-to-day, I guess

[2:18:26] <InugamiTheHound> pat is OP just like in the dark souls 3
[2:18:26] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> [Menacing MAN]
[2:18:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You are WAY too overleveled Pat
[2:18:27] <%segonian> give your enemy a baby and they're defeated for a week. teach your enemy to make babies and they can be defeated forever.
[2:18:30] <takiyami> There's a tunnel off the street
[2:18:30] <phatballlz54> it was over before it started!
[2:18:32] <dickbuttwoman> Go under the bridge there
[2:18:34] <+mrshazboto> I don't get it, why would you EVER fight Kiryu?
[2:18:36] <+paladinstarbuster> HE FELL
[2:18:39] <Conky89> Either they have brittle bones or Kiryu punches like a god.
[2:18:41] <$cureneckbeard> Menacing men are drawn to Kiryu like stand users
[2:18:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LVL UP MORE
[2:18:49] <President_valentine> cause they don't know it's Kiryu
[2:18:49] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> nah
[2:18:52] <+dukenux> They don't know about Kiryu here
[2:18:53] <+Deano8817> it didn't matter in dark souls either tho
[2:18:53] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat you forgot to go to the rock and say yo angelo
[2:18:56] <falconx9k> Kiryu should be OP
[2:18:57] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You should really not be fucking these dudes in one or two hits
[2:18:58] <%Laecerelius> Pat isn't OP enough
[2:18:59] <%MagickBurritoh> This map is pleasant
[2:19:00] <%connos_livereview> Nah
[2:19:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> No Pat, you HAVE to struggle! >:C
[2:19:00] <+Randomuser50> pat does canada have milk in bags?
[2:19:01] <grayjammer> It also didn't matter in Dark Souls 3 either
[2:19:03] <DingusMcBaseball> super comfy
[2:19:04] <zerocruz> Pat is way too HUGE for early game PogChamp
[2:19:05] <$RubberFistFight> "Kiryu where have you been whilst I've been watching this infant?" "Oh, I went and got hilariously drunk and then beat up some locals." "How ma-" "ALL OF THEM"
[2:19:06] <Utible> me PogChamp
[2:19:07] <Capn_Bilge> that last boss still took some hits so he doesn't seem super OP anyway
[2:19:07] <@Mechz71> not me
[2:19:08] <starotter70> Hai?
[2:19:09] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It's canon. Kiryu should be overleveled.
[2:19:12] <Ninjask_45> yup
[2:19:12] <rytisone> who? me? naaaahhhh
[2:19:15] <+Th3SmartAlec> @President_valentine That concept only gets more absurd with time

[2:19:21] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat I want to see you Overlevel SO MUCH that the next boss you fight just FALLS OVER after one hit
[2:19:22] <+d00msdaydan> yo that's super illegal
[2:19:22] <+Th3SmartAlec> CRIMES
[2:19:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Eh, I'm not really much of a weeb
[2:19:23] <KohryuZX> Kiryu SHOULD be the OPIEST motherfucker in japan
[2:19:24] <%spiritofmojave> Me, a weeb, here? Can't be!
[2:19:25] <+thebrownsauce> Sprinting on a belly full of wine sounds fucking horrible
[2:19:26] <starotter70> Kiryu the criminal
[2:19:33] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> I kind of want to go, but I feel like i'd feel uncomfortable and out of place
[2:19:39] <%supersugoisenpai1> Spent half a week in Tokyo, it was rad
[2:19:39] <alcors_wisdom> kiryu "never commited a crime" kazuma
[2:19:40] <Dr_Mooose> eww
[2:19:41] <+MoonlightP> That's not sanitary
[2:19:42] <+dukenux> WutFace

[2:20:00] <Rshiners> go to shops alley
[2:20:04] <pinapplelee> there’s lots of foreigners now you’ll be fine
[2:20:04] <dickbuttwoman> That was the one you just got I think
[2:20:05] <fearhurst> Stunderwear
[2:20:07] <OkamiDude15> steel underwear also known as a chastity belt
[2:20:09] <President_valentine> @th3smartalec To be fair he's in a small ass town here who probably heard of him but know what he looks like
[2:20:11] <alcors_wisdom> @devanmuse most people call them chasity belts
[2:20:12] <austing1011> is Kiryu secretly a STAND USER and a STAND at the same time!?!?!?!
[2:20:12] <%copyritetm> this game gives me huge ps2 vibes
[2:20:16] <InugamiTheHound> yeah he looks so much better
[2:20:18] <Capn_Bilge> no jacket means kiryu's fat butt is on display
[2:20:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> DADRYU
[2:20:19] <+mrshazboto> But without the jacket you can't see the blood
[2:20:20] <+Deano8817> really?
[2:20:21] <President_valentine> *don't
[2:20:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> ?????
[2:20:22] <person181> i like it when his shirt is off
[2:20:24] <+코코꾸라> That's a good idea
[2:20:24] <+Deano8817> oh I see
[2:20:25] <+dukenux> Shenmue III looks good
[2:20:25] <%spiritofmojave> Smart move
[2:20:25] <starotter70> ok
[2:20:28] <%MagickBurritoh> SWORD
[2:20:30] <phatballlz54> hell even real yakuza hate that goddamn jacket
[2:20:35] <%PaladinDupre> Imagine if Haruto and Kiryu had matching outfits!
[2:20:35] <+aivalera> @AngriestPat There is no bad frame rate weit the pro I think
[2:20:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> Threatening men
[2:20:36] <%Laecerelius> You're doing Kiwami 2 on stream now?
[2:20:36] <$RubberFistFight> holy shit did that dude just procure a sword from thin air?
[2:20:36] <%kewlmyc> Kiwami 2 will be out on PC by then too
[2:20:38] <+Th3SmartAlec> @devanmuse hey now, Woolie could have used that in the Part 37 of the DMC5 LP
[2:20:39] <+Liliana_L> good idea
[2:20:39] <%laserbeaming> PC Version should be fine
[2:20:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> He was about to stab someone
[2:20:40] <physicaldepression> PC version?
[2:20:41] <+Deano8817> but the gameplay improvements between 2 to jeudgement tho
[2:20:41] <+mrshazboto> Ohhhh. Kiwami 2 has framerate issues?
[2:20:43] <Strayed1> is kiwami 2 60fps?
[2:20:48] <+ElEversoris> pc version should be pretty good
[2:20:50] <%Ranryu692> Take a long break before Kiwami 2
[2:20:54] <majindusto> Kiwami 2 Framerate is good tho
[2:20:56] <+aivalera> @mrshazboto With none-pro ps4s
[2:20:59] <rosemon5001> i guess the babyman quest will have to wait then @AngriestPat
[2:21:01] <%Kataguro> That's fair
[2:21:01] <HeadsHeldHigh> Did it not?
[2:21:03] <Luesagna00> so you in a diff place now instead of that city?
[2:21:06] <%PaladinDupre> Play Fist of the North Star
[2:21:06] <%kewlmyc> I won't
[2:21:10] <%kewlmyc> It won't
[2:21:10] <%bread_assassin> That sounds like a big if.
[2:21:14] <starotter70> @Luesagna00 Yup, Hiroshima
[2:21:16] <HeadsHeldHigh> Ah shit I thought it did for some reason
[2:21:16] <%laserbeaming> Child is probably dead now
[2:21:17] <%CappuccinoGuil> I'm sorry, I'm not seeing his logic here
[2:21:19] <+paladinstarbuster> Yes
[2:21:20] <+aivalera> @PaladinDupre That's a good idea
[2:21:23] <notToph> it won't, because it'd neuter the PS4 sales Pat
[2:21:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> > Master Race LUL
[2:21:34] <Rshiners> you go in there later
[2:21:36] <Tekaii00> @AngriestPat have you seen the P5 Royal trailer?
[2:21:36] <+Take_2_shots> Get some PC unlocked framerates
[2:21:40] <+Deano8817> 60 fps for pc is pretty baller
[2:21:41] <%laserbeaming> Framerate reigns supreme
[2:21:42] <OkamiDude15> but pat what about that line at the bottom of the screen?
[2:21:42] <InugamiTheHound> its fine!
[2:21:44] <majindusto> JUST PLAY THEM ON PS4
[2:21:44] <person181> which child, kiryu has 2 now
[2:21:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> Dame Dame sukide
[2:21:46] <$Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat what if it releases only on the epic store
[2:21:46] <dalishprince> we'll get a new one
[2:21:50] <%wolfofsound> eh you can always make more children
[2:21:51] <falconx9k> It be that way sometimes
[2:21:51] <%korth367> who gives a fuck about ps4 at this point
[2:21:53] <supersonic21> man this game is pretty
[2:21:55] <+mrshazboto> Does 6 have a PC release date?
[2:21:55] <Graywolf_the_45th> drunk guy probably stole your baby by now
[2:21:56] <mr_ESB> Judge eyes pc might happen but not for awhile
[2:21:56] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Check the babies butt.
[2:21:57] <%Gatzarlok> Also wasn't Date supposed to look after the baby?
[2:21:58] <%shiplord13> He is just drinking some whisky
[2:21:59] <mrblack499> is this blind?
[2:22:01] <pinapplelee> child has booze
[2:22:01] <Vohs_Bru> ok its sleepy time for me, Bye everyone Have a fun stream
[2:22:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> Drunk Kiryu shouldn't be around children anyway
[2:22:05] <+cvp5127> did kiryu leave the baby with a stranger?
[2:22:07] <%bread_assassin> Kiryu offloading his grandson on a women he spoke to for like five minutes.
[2:22:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Gatzarlok Date is looking over Haruka
[2:22:15] <Rshiners> she's a mama it's all good
[2:22:18] <starotter70> Feed that baby some alcohol
[2:22:22] <+dukenux> Bar lady is taking care of baby
[2:22:28] <%wolfofsound> @bread_assassin still probably better than kiryu
[2:22:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> Responsible Kiryu
[2:22:32] <+dukenux> BEER
[2:22:32] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @cvp5127 to be fair, he went outside for 5 minutes to kill a man, pat's just taking his time.
[2:22:32] <+코코꾸라> @AngriestPat Nagoshi said they don't have plans for now to port Judgment anywhere
[2:22:33] <%bread_assassin> Fair
[2:22:33] <falconx9k> More drunk
[2:22:34] <Luesagna00> kiyru looks sooo much better without that jacket on

[2:22:56] <fruit_pie_the_magician> LITERALLY the first person he saw
[2:23:06] <%spiritofmojave> Kiryu probably has the meanest poops
[2:23:06] <%CappuccinoGuil> There's an aspect of the UI that makes it look really on budget and I love it
[2:23:07] <$Totally_not_toby> DRANK
[2:23:08] <dalishprince> thats gonna be a huge shit
[2:23:11] <falconx9k> Kiryu shovels it all into his bottomless pit of a stomach
[2:23:14] <President_valentine> Mama is the proper way to address women bartenders
[2:23:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> EAT THE MAIN COURSES
[2:23:22] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Stop getting so drunk pat
[2:23:25] <notToph> 코코꾸라 I could see them doing it after it comes out on PS4, 3-5 aren't going to come out for a while in the west, and they might not wanna skip straight to 6.

[3:11:02] <$shurtal> cheer500 Fun Fact: If you ask a nurse at the hospital where your children were just delivered "how old the kids have to be before you can shake them", they make you watch a bunch of shaken baby syndrome videos before the cops allow you to take your newborn twins home. Also Fun Fact: MY BROTHER IS A FUCKING DIPSHIT, and thought it was worth the horrified look on the nurses face.

[3:13:52] <%skizzuto> sleeping in the same bed as your baby is a super bad idea
[3:13:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's a natural instinct not to roll over onto a small living thing you're sleeping with Pat.

[3:13:55] <person181> "don't roll on the baby" legit the first thing my mom told my dad

[3:14:43] <%Solidnick18> Throw the baby
[3:14:44] <omen_setter> i can't believe this brawler game has an extended section where you take care of a baby
[3:14:44] <WaxWitch> use the baby as a weapon
[3:14:44] <@lewdskeletor13> BABY HEAT MOVES
[3:14:45] <Ninjask_45> baby is weapon

[3:14:52] <%Laecerelius> After seeing him beat the FUCK out of these guys I wouldn't run
[3:14:52] <Admiral_Apathy> they shouldve made kiryu chuck him up into the air and then catch him when the fight ends
[3:14:53] <+misterfistor> Use baby as a GUN @AngriestPat
[3:14:53] <ProfessorLitmus> no beast style baby combos
[3:14:54] <+Spec7re> You gotta get them while they are young
[3:14:54] <@PlagueOfGripes> holding babies makes heroes more powerful
[3:14:55] <pinapplelee> “oh sweet a baby”
[3:14:55] <Seitine> Just wait till he hands it off to a pedo.
[3:14:56] <alcors_wisdom> if you watched the guy who just handed you a baby pick up a bike and deck a guy with it would you risk running?
[3:14:56] <simulationbard> "Hey baby watch this shit"
[3:14:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> He has the baby fight like an undersized stand
[3:14:57] <Archmortal> I still think deep down this game should've been dedicated to Haruka becoming the new dragon and kicking everyone's shit in
[3:14:57] <fabnanman> good thing this game doesn't take place in China Kappa
[3:14:59] <ミュウレ4242> a man hand you a baby, then makes thug sauce out of like 5 guys. do you steal his baby?
[3:14:59] <starotter70> @AngriestPat Speaking of Rolling Over, what if you Roll Over on a colostomy bag in your sleep and pop it
[3:15:00] <%Mornaka> THE BABBY OF DOJIMA
[3:15:00] <gremoirhirst> Honestly if a stranger handed me a baby and started super villain charging up and beating up some random men, I probably would run...
[3:15:01] <+RushUnplugged> It's ok, Baby has EXP-Share and gets part of the punchExp
[3:15:01] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat they should ve made him fight with the baby "baby pillow fight style"
[3:15:02] <takiyami> Projectile vomit
[3:15:02] <+secretspud> Baby is GUN
[3:15:05] <Paperware> Fastball special the baby
[3:15:05] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> His fists are his guns
[3:15:05] <%arancet> oh man, i WISH kiryuu threw the baby up in the air, fought the guys, and then the fight finishes with him catching the baby
[3:15:06] <InkyDraconian> Shove the baby in the wound
[3:15:06] <fearhurst> Nice organs, baby
[3:15:08] <Dr_Mooose> same thing
[3:15:09] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat drop off baby then you can do stuff
[3:15:09] <+dukenux> He has a knife Kappa
[3:15:11] <+secretspud> GUN baby
[3:15:11] <person181> gun has become baby
[3:15:11] <DashXero> Trade the baby for a gun.
[3:15:12] <majindusto> Piss Gun

[3:15:14] <+Take_2_shots> MOSHI MOSHI

[3:15:17] <+Spec7re> Use the baby like a gun
[3:15:18] <marco39120> That baby is gonna grow up thinking it's OK to just fight random people when it gets older
[3:15:19] <%PaladinDupre> Toss the baby up, beat the dudes, and catch the baby
[3:15:19] <dickbuttwoman> The baby can shoot projectile piss
[3:15:20] <+krispen_wa> shit sniped by plague
[3:15:21] <CrypticMochi> That baby will do sick heat moves when it grows up
[3:15:21] <+Thornarn> G U N B A B Y
[3:15:22] <%MelBrooksKA> I'm starting to think the CPS guy was right not to give Kiryu the baby...
[3:15:23] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Remember when Kiryu made drugs for the baby?
[3:15:23] <$cureneckbeard> The pissing guy is even more of a dick when you remember the ocean is right there.
[3:15:24] <a_mad_dragon> it's a joke about american cops thinking everything is a gun
[3:15:25] <pinapplelee> dad rub

[3:15:44] <falconx9k> USHIGOROSHI
[3:15:47] <%Kataguro> I would for Kiryu
[3:15:48] <KangarooCyborg> He should just throw the baby into the sky and catch him when the fight is over
[3:15:48] <%theAncopro> would you hand elmo to stranger
[3:15:48] <%AncelDeLambert> DED
[3:15:50] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PlagueOfGripes I GET THAT REFERENCE. jackie chan holding a baby in a china shop on a ladder who doesnt want any trouble, most powerful being ever
[3:15:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> If I saw what he did to those guys, I would

[3:15:54] <%SaltyDongs> Drop the baby
[3:15:55] <fearhurst> Christ aliv
[3:15:56] <a_mad_dragon> he'd drop the baby on the pavement and run
[3:15:56] <+secretspud> Pat would aquire baby S Links on the street
[3:15:57] <+JavaManJoJo> Would you really say no to Kiryu though??
[3:15:57] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> HE IS DEAD dammit!
[3:15:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> Paige I'd do it only to not get the shit beat out of me
[3:15:59] <%spiritofmojave> If Kiryu told you to and you didn't, Pat would be fucking offed
[3:15:59] <JunkyardCrow> I definitely would
[3:16:01] <@PlagueOfGripes> some men were born to hold unwanted babies. the kind of men whose first marriage is to a divorced mother of two
[3:16:01] <squirtkitten> Style Unlocked: BABY
[3:16:02] <$cureneckbeard> If you follow Kiryu around you eventually get to hold the baby
[3:16:02] <%Gatzarlok> Are you really going to say no to the guy who just beat the shit out of 3 people no problem?
[3:16:02] <%ThatGuyfromMars> jesus h

[3:16:06] <+Promessa_EX> you would because human
[3:16:07] <takiyami> He's just sleeping, don't worry
[3:16:08] <%razorknight> HES SLEEPING
[3:16:09] <devanmuse> I mean, if you saw what the guy was doing to people immediately after asking you to hold the baby, i doubt you'd want to make him angry
[3:16:09] <pinapplelee> throw the baby in the ocean
[3:16:09] <DashXero> Kids have to learn violence early.
[3:16:11] <WaxWitch> ded

[3:34:23] <+krispen_wa> The style at the time
[3:34:23] <+misterfistor> @AngriestPat Ichiban's tattoo is a carp becoming a dragon
[3:34:25] <+Sulfur_Boride> @AngriestPat Ichiban's back tattoo is a koi that turned into a dragon. Which is fitting, since he's voiced by Nishiki
[3:34:26] <%rdark_ksu> oooooooookinawa
[3:34:27] <SephirKath> Majima is the father of the baby and the yakuzi dude

[3:34:50] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> he cant be any kid you know since he's in his 40's and the game is in 2018
[3:34:50] <+murderofcrows1> Grandpa Kiryu is the best.

[3:35:05] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Someone inform Woolie. Pat needs some re-education
[3:35:05] <takiyami> So he's more like Majima then?
[3:35:06] <%AncelDeLambert> of COURSE he's Okinawa Nishiki

[3:35:13] <+misterfistor> @RubberFistFight It's an old chinese legend. Carp rides a waterfull upwards and becomes a dragon
[3:35:13] <gkingsausagelink> so nishiki is his dad
[3:35:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah his story is going to be about BECOMING a cool guy instead of Kiryu who starts as a cool guy.
[3:35:21] <Marpolo13> MAJIIIIMAAAA
[3:35:22] <+dukenux> ohai @JohnMarkley
[3:35:22] <+Toppunchpoopbob> He's Majima, Kiryu and Nishiki in one guy
[3:35:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @darthbatman72 It's very possible.
[3:35:23] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> PFFFFT
[3:35:23] <%shiplord13> So Nishiki is his father

[3:35:26] <mr_slaide> She loves it!
[3:35:27] <DraxTD> HA

[3:35:46] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Man I'd love a Yakuza game with Kiryu just being done with yakuza stuff and instead just doing dumb sidequests and minigames all the time, and that's the story
[3:35:47] <dickbuttwoman> And, we're back at the prologue

[3:36:21] <aristomuse> ohshit
[3:36:22] <+RushUnplugged> it puzzles me as to why Nishiki would get a koi tattoo together with Kiryu's dragon, and then complain he's stuck down as Kiryu rises; I know it's a metaphor, but he's kinda looking for it?
[3:36:22] <+dukenux> makes sense
[3:36:22] <切捨御免> sad kiryu ._.

[3:37:14] <$RubberFistFight> @misterfistor well it's literally a koi turning into an asian-styled dragon. Non-asians were kinda baffled when the game first came to their shores because fish turning into dragons is weird, unless you know the legend.

[3:42:24] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah, those games you playing in creepy alleys
[3:42:25] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat people are more easily assholes to those they don't know. Kiryu was a complete outsider to this dude and had no social contract with him, so he immediately rubbed him the wrong way. It's pretty standard human tribal behaviour that everyone is or has been guilty of.
[3:42:28] <+Grimlockfly> Night game Pat

[3:43:00] <%MonsieurHedge> i cant believe koichi has his own branch family
[3:43:00] <gremoirhirst> Maybe there was a night game. Not of death??
[3:43:01] <%manwithboxonhead> LUL
[3:43:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "Ino-san, do you actually own other clothes?"

[3:43:27] <DashXero> Dude, Kiryu's taken out entire FAMILIES.
[3:43:27] <+krispen_wa> That's a man who has no idea who Kiryu is
[3:43:30] <simulationbard> Yeah he can
[3:43:32] <%Hammerknife> >can't take on the yakuza >is literally all of the yakuza in one
[3:43:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Romulus1213 All you need to know about the Hiroshima Yakuza is that they all stay in their areas, and they function like feudal Japanese Yakuzas.
[3:43:34] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Kiryu has done worse.
[3:43:35] <+HeyBoston> kiryu takes on the yakuza by himself all the time bro
[3:43:35] <alcors_wisdom> an entire clan man
[3:43:36] <devanmuse> "You can't take on the Yakuza alone" Bitch, do you know how many times I've done this?
[3:43:36] <%theAncopro> has only taken on the entire tojo multiple times but these 5 guys yea maybe not today
[3:43:37] <%dave323dave> he's done it multiple times!
[3:43:39] <%Kataguro> Why did they go up there?
[3:43:39] <%Niney_Who> Kiryu defeated ONE HUNDRED MEN on his own
[3:43:40] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Lopeway
[3:43:43] <%CaptainTubaki> he clearly hasnt heard of kiryu
[3:43:43] <%korth367> this is another tuesday for kiryu
[3:43:44] <WreckItRaz> honestly I don't think Kiryu has ever fought a proper Yakuza in his life
[3:43:44] <alcors_wisdom> how man fucking people were at that funeral
[3:43:47] <%Romulus1213> Kiryu's whole schtick is taking on the Yakuza by himself
[3:43:50] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat for that fight beat the adds first there is something funny about it
[3:43:51] <@commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Hey Pat, you see the new Loonie? It's cool
[3:43:55] <Marpolo13> YES
[3:43:55] <WreckItRaz> and certainly not multiple upon multiple times
[3:43:58] <切捨御免> oh my god
[3:44:00] <circular7> yes
[3:44:01] <%CaptainTubaki> @Kataguro probably to kill or beat him close to death
[3:44:02] <+krispen_wa> He dodged rocket launchers casually while taking on 98 other men
[3:44:02] <Marpolo13> litterally EVERYONE
[3:44:04] <%Kataguro> @alcors_wisdom I totally forgot Kiryu killed an entire giant funeral
[3:44:04] <takiyami> They're stand users but without the stands
[3:44:05] <a_mad_dragon> the kiryu kurse
[3:44:05] <reonome> you mean the SONG of life
[3:44:06] <KangarooCyborg> Kiryu's super power is that he throws a punch and faces appear in front of his fist
[3:44:06] <+murderofcrows1> Ha! It’s funny because Kiryu can.
[3:44:08] <切捨御免> those subtitles weren't what he said at all jesus christ
[3:44:08] <Ion_Laser> That the series in a nutshell
[3:44:08] <%Tearonex> "Don't worry, I've dealt with far tougher"
[3:44:10] <IBeastmanNinjaI1> Kiryu has killed a hundred million people every day, he can probably handle it
[3:44:13] <+DukeMoose> Why are you leafs making new weird coins?

[3:44:29] <Lokito3o5> Hey lowlifes wanna have nolife?
[3:44:35] <Marpolo13> Kiryu is so strong he has killed hundreds of people by not actually killing them
[3:44:35] <+HeyBoston> that man is dead
[3:44:35] <alcors_wisdom> @Kataguro turned that funeral into a mass grave knowwhatimsayin
[3:44:41] <frozenottsel> Kiryu is the fucking Dragon of Dojima, these guys don't even have a chance

[4:05:40] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat They're a backwoods family in the clan, so far down people on top don't even know em. They're peons
[4:05:41] <$Grimlockfly> never the cat food
[4:05:43] <%Hammerknife> a lot of yakuza in RL run real businesses that aren't illegal
[4:05:44] <%MagickBurritoh> Buy a buoy
[4:05:44] <GreyHeartedHero> They're likd 5 guys
[4:05:46] <%Verd_254> maybe its his passion if he didn't have to commit big crime

[4:05:54] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @angriestpat gotta spend money to steal money, which requires legit money
[4:05:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Bars are a cash based buisness like dry cleaners and car washes
[4:05:55] <%Hammerknife> i think almost every construction business in JP is yakuza owned or connected
[4:05:58] <%theAncopro> but they never collect so the only money they get is prob form this bar
[4:06:03] <%maybefalco> kill them super hard
[4:06:03] <+RowenCleric> why are Kiryu's pockets just full of cat food
[4:06:06] <ミュウレ4242> even colonol sanders framed his biggest competitor for murder to get ahead in the hcicken game.
[4:06:07] <%MagickBurritoh> Nighttime street murders
[4:06:09] <+DukeMoose> If you have legit busines you gain CIVILIAN legitamacy, average joes on the street will say that Al Capone fella is allright
[4:06:15] <majindusto> Everyone is Poor...even the Criminals
[4:06:29] <%Hammerknife> actually i know that for a fact - a bunch of yakuza got contracts to rebuild some stuff at fukushima and they got called out for hiring homeless people to go into the radiation zone

[4:28:28] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Palpable
[4:28:32] <$XeroSigmaPrime> There's no indication of P5R being $90 anywhere
[4:28:43] <+Sp3ctre48> It's gonna be the regular price here
[4:28:44] <+mrshazboto> Wait, the consultant?
[4:28:50] <laveyrin> yeah not adding back in Hifumi as a team member is tragic
[4:28:53] <$XeroSigmaPrime> @Sphincter_Spelunker But we get a better Hifumi now!
[4:28:56] <alcors_wisdom> this is the work internet
[4:29:00] <xeros720> P5R is just probably 90 CAD, buying canadian games sucks
