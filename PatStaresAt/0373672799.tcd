[0:41:27] <+mashinchaserr> hello Kappa
[0:41:28] <%ooblagis> Love how Pat is playing quite serious, despite beasting on someone who never played the game before
[0:41:28] <sackerkappa> Cell is part Goku. Thankfully that part isn't the one where he neglects his children.
[0:41:28] <%Siebersboy> oh I didnt even notice I got a gift sub thank @BryceNStuff cutie apatJpeg
[0:41:29] <$Tuskor13> you think a barrier will work

[0:42:09] <%MANDRAGORAROOT> he did it :)
[0:42:10] <Rezroc> Is this? Ultra Instinct?
[0:42:12] <The_Shrouded_Lord> @Siebersboy doesnt cell immediately force his newborn children to fight for him, and then make no effort to save them when they start dying?
[0:42:15] <%Solidnick18> go fuggins
[0:42:18] <Maxicqwe> if you play with another scrub is fine
[0:42:22] <sackerkappa> No dunks for you.

[0:42:36] <%Siebersboy> @The_Shrouded_Lord I thinl you @ the wrong person but yes
[0:42:36] <dakuman13> chat yes it is, it has a dedicated tutorial to teach you fighting games and everything
[0:42:37] <+pantherpiss2> wow foggens is that kind of guy?
[0:42:38] <spawnzombie> GG is good for a newbie in the sense that it has an insanely good tutorial but if by noob you legit mean "how the fuck do I shoryuken" then hell no.

[0:42:42] <%ECRead> Guilty Gear TUTORIALS are good for noobs, GG itself is not
[0:42:43] <+badchoice5> Money well spent
[0:42:43] <+BorinCorran> Can I be real and say I really liked Goku Black and Zamasu? It's what got me hard back into DBZ.

[0:43:07] <+Birdigalore> @AngriestPat Fuggins should pick Jiren cuz he has the biggerestest number
[0:43:07] <dekkitout> pat channels his true short power into vegeta
[0:43:09] <Emdhad> @pat quarter circle back special and heavy for the 16 instant kill
[0:43:10] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Vegeta canonically stronger than 3 Gokus

[0:46:22] <DraxTD> oh no Pan is killed by elemneating TEEN videll
[0:46:24] <sileo_patronus> I've yet to be convinced that Jiren and Pepsiman are different characters
[0:46:24] <%SpamKingRathalos> Jiren looks like the final boss of an Xcom mission.
[0:46:26] <xemeas> Oh my god why isnt el hermano acolor!!!!!!!!!?

[0:47:42] <%MANDRAGORAROOT> hey frieza your brother is hot
[0:47:42] <%Buttface_> @angriestpat it's a counter on the ground and a grab in the air
[0:47:43] <+BishopBain> Is Cooler cooler than Jiren? Kappa
[0:47:43] <ShichiNoBushi> I'd say he's cool... er.
[0:47:44] <%SilverDevilfish> He's Frieza but the Predator rooVV
[0:47:45] <@shinsaryn> @angriestpat Jiren is just Geese in this game btw.
[0:47:46] <OwlLightningMage> Jiren and Superman should fuse together to become the most boring character LUL
[0:47:46] <braincraft> Cooler's level 3 is a counter on the ground, but a grab in the air.
[0:47:47] <shryoc> multi round conditioning
[0:47:48] <%Remery_> why is he choking us?
[0:47:52] <CrypticMochi> Frieza but Cooler
[0:47:52] <dakuman13> because hes cooler
[0:47:52] <%SvenHolgersson> He has MORE
[0:47:52] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> "The Big Ghetto star allows me to CHEAT death...HOW CAN THS BEEEEE?!"
[0:47:53] <+mashinchaserr> that's his 4th form
[0:47:53] <%FrustratedAF> he doesn't need FORMS
[0:47:54] <Kataguro> He turns into Metal
[0:47:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Don't think about it
[0:47:55] <TheGershon> He had more forms than freeza
[0:47:55] <%ArchimerDreatect> movie villains, pat
[0:47:55] <KeiPrime> cooler becomes metal tho
[0:47:56] <ebonifragaria> Hurt me more dawg
[0:47:56] <+ATentacleMonster> is that based Fuggins?
[0:47:57] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> He starts with Frieza's Final Form
[0:47:57] <+badchoice5> But he doesn't train either I uess
[0:47:57] <%GohanEgret> @Remery_ you know why Kappa
[0:47:57] <Mattmandx1> Jiren might actually be intentionally boring as a parody of super serious mopey protagonists
[0:47:58] <dagorad> he goes 1 form more than frieza
[0:47:58] <MagknO> it's a sexual thing Kappa
[0:47:58] <+BorinCorran> Final form Cooler is better than Golden Frieza.
[0:47:59] <%Paralurx> He has more forms than Freeza
[0:47:59] <%Kravedarknesss> @AngriestPat Movies...
[0:47:59] <%ooblagis> He's non-canon. It don't matter. None of dis matters
[0:47:59] <%Skeletorexplains> Cooler is in his 4th form
[0:48:00] <RipSlamsteak> don't worry about it
[0:48:00] <PowerWeightedCell> because his base form is his 3rd form
[0:48:00] <gustavozxd> lmao videl just hiding in the back
[0:48:00] <+Sir_Carl> cooler is the jobberest jobber
[0:48:01] <+MeronLod> Is Cooler voiced by fucking Eggman from Sonic X?
[0:48:01] <%Agent_For_Hire> cheer1500 Hey Pat, been watching since two best friends watch other M and just wanted to say that even now you're a source of humor in the good and bad times.
[0:48:01] <%korth367> he's frieza's oniichan
[0:48:01] <synthcutter> who cares
[0:48:01] <+Trenr> he starts out at a higher form
[0:48:02] <%Doster503> Pat's dressed as his subscribe emote! apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:48:02] <%Solidnick18> then trunk does things
[0:48:03] <Zdawg39> Pat is so cool you guys
[0:48:03] <%Reverend_Roscoe> hes already transformed
[0:48:03] <zecht89> that's his 5th form
[0:48:04] <FenixSeraph> he doesn't need forms like his scrub brother
[0:48:04] <%Skeletorexplains> that form is his 5th form
[0:48:04] <Zombrocom> Jiren is wierd, he has a bunch of counters, his 5h is a grab, his 2s is a 2h
[0:48:05] <Vashido22> LUL
[0:48:05] <derekwst3> Cooler has more forms he just stays at this form
[0:48:06] <%Solidnick18> oof
[0:48:06] <alcors_wisdom> no
[0:48:06] <dekkitout> also, gold cooler is a thing
[0:48:07] <IBeastmanNinjaI1> Cooler is still my favorite DBZ character
[0:48:07] <person181> add him to the game
[0:48:07] <%theAncopro> no he has one more form than frieze pre-golden
[0:48:07] <Kataguro> That's a demon
[0:48:07] <OwlLightningMage> He's not even canon
[0:48:07] <%Fadedblank247> ugh garlic jr
[0:48:07] <dakuman13> he has the same amount of forms as base frieza
[0:48:08] <%Remery_> @GohanEgret no never
[0:48:08] <hyphenated_q> He doesn't NEED as many forms
[0:48:08] <%MANDRAGORAROOT> no
[0:48:09] <%GohanEgret> NO
[0:48:09] <+Tarkara> no
[0:48:10] <$Chimeraelite> STOP THAT
[0:48:10] <%poopchalk> Cooler is the "cooler" frieza
[0:48:10] <Mnightshyamallama> that is the form that frieza can't reach and you are so fuckin wrong pat
[0:48:10] <$TheNeedlesD> No, he's a Garlic
[0:48:11] <$cureneckbeard> How are there so many people stronger than Freeza
[0:48:12] <%bestwaifuritsu> Holy shit look at Jirens derpy eyes because of the white dots LUL
[0:48:12] <majindusto> No
[0:48:13] <%CerberusDriver> Garlic Jr DLC
[0:48:13] <Vashido22> No
[0:48:13] <%TempestaDePrimo> The big ghetto star LUL
[0:48:13] <Sedrelic> no..its a pilaf
[0:48:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> Yes
[0:48:14] <PowerWeightedCell> Frieza made weaker forms to hide his power
[0:48:14] <alcors_wisdom> garlic jr is a vampire thing
[0:48:14] <marvel877> Jiren is freaking Endeavor, I have even more of a reason to not like him.
[0:48:15] <%MyDarkStorm> We never see 1st or 2nd form
[0:48:15] <%Tearonex> Frieza is alright, but his brother is COOLER
[0:48:15] <+TomServal> @angriestpat Movie canon is SUPER DIFFERENT
[0:48:16] <%SilverDevilfish> Garlic Jr. Does not exist who is that?
[0:48:16] <Deadbulky> No demon
[0:48:17] <+shawntk_> he's a demon
[0:48:18] <+horsey_sauce_> he starts in his final form PAT
[0:48:18] <$spacehouse> Garlic DLC WHEN
[0:48:19] <jobbedbone> @AngriestPat maybe you should learn to code
[0:48:19] <Kataguro> Dead Zone DLC when
[0:48:19] <foxyfury_22> He was already transformed, dummies
[0:48:21] <alcors_wisdom> slug is a picolo

[0:48:22] <%blacksoap65> @StridentSong TY
[0:48:23] <FunkyStreams> holy shit mad call backs
[0:48:25] <derekwst3> we need a pikkon, that would be a cool addition
[0:48:26] <braincraft> Jiren's glowy hand is a projectile counter.
[0:48:27] <person181> remember when piccalo was a DEMON
[0:48:28] <KiraKamixephos> Demon piccolo
[0:48:29] <%Solidnick18> When is niel
[0:48:29] <sackerkappa> He's bigger than Frieza, therefore making him stronger.

[0:54:58] <dakuman13> Gohan dont beat your wife
[0:55:00] <DocMadfox> It's fine, Goku likes beating his son

[0:55:07] <%mostundesired> Gohan is a wife beater confirmed.
[0:55:11] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Shota
[0:55:11] <%SilverDevilfish> Beat up that child form of your husband
[0:55:12] <%MrBorisMakarov> OH NO

[0:55:15] <%Remery_> Shota
[0:55:15] <majindusto> Super is perfectly fine tho
[0:55:17] <TheGershon> This is like... Padme and Anakin
[0:55:18] <Kataguro> Did she just air grab him with her thighs?
[0:55:19] <jojopizzapasta> I just wish the characters were more different. Most everybody feels exactly the same and the people that don't are generally low tier because they don't have he homogeneous tools
[0:55:19] <Deadbulky> Future broodmother
[0:55:20] <synthcutter> Super sucks
[0:55:22] <TheGershon> Don't kill me

[0:55:25] <@shinsaryn> The RIGHT Videl apatCrazyhand
[0:55:25] <dakuman13> Yeah gohan doesnt even remotely seem like the same character
[0:55:27] <%SvenHolgersson> Best part about that leg grab? It's called the Frankensteiner
[0:55:27] <+Shadowtalon77> videl on that padme shit
[0:55:27] <%Fadedblank247> that means shes gonna bang hercule though
[0:55:28] <nepwar> what a sad battle. gohan has to fight his two dads and his wife

[0:55:33] <Deano8817> WHAT LUL
[0:55:34] <+MeronLod> I can't believe Gohan beats his wife
[0:55:35] <braincraft> Yes, Videl has a Frankensteiner.

[0:55:39] <arcaderabbit48> The multiple Gokus was already super weird, but seeing Videl beat up her boyfriend when he was 12 is surreal as hell
[0:55:40] <sponsoredviewer910> LUL
[0:55:41] <jebbushfan53> super has kick ass fights
[0:55:42] <ShichiNoBushi> Gohan: "Videl, meet my dad." Picolo: "Hey."
[0:55:44] <hyphenated_q> It's okay to beat them if they aren't your wife yet
[0:55:45] <deviljhojho94> what
[0:55:45] <ScreamingMeat> It's kinda weird to me that they have transformations as separate characters instead of part of a single character's move set like in the old Budokai games
[0:55:46] <moogleboy1984> Speaking of Chi-Chi, who do you think they'll pair her with? Ox King?
[0:55:47] <%GohanEgret> look at that Vince McMahon power strut from Gotenks

[0:55:58] <moogleboy1984> except Freiza

[0:58:01] <+BorinCorran> @arcaderabbit48 When BoG came out I rewatched the whole series. I will never do it again because the Buu saga is so boring. There's some good stuff, but not enough to justify it.

[1:16:10] <%Skeletorexplains> How Pathetic
[1:16:14] <arcaderabbit48> @SilverDevilfish Admittedly I liked that their end solution was going back in time to kill him off before he even got to that point. Buuuut as Plague points out, that doesn't actually solve anything and doesnt make sense.
[1:16:14] <+blastazoid26> Is this a Scrublords?
[1:16:17] <+aslfrasle> Pat is being punished for liking Jiren, even if only for a second.

[1:19:00] <+Tunamanguy> ginyu boys ww@
[1:19:01] <Mr_Floobis> ginyu atpChar
[1:19:01] <dakuman13> ginyu is in fact fake goku
[1:19:02] <%Remery_> IS 21 really a villian?
[1:19:02] <+badchoice5> If only Pat played Jiren in the show, the Earth team would have had no trouble defeating him
[1:19:02] <nepwar> 21 is not a villian in my eyes
[1:19:02] <Sloavon> LUL heroes
[1:19:02] <faegbeard> el gohan blanko
[1:19:03] <nina9669> is 21 low tier?
[1:19:03] <%MANDRAGORAROOT> unlock el hermano
[1:19:04] <TheGershon> Wait for the mod
[1:19:06] <$TehPryceIsRight> just dont down heavy as Jiren in the air unless you ki ball down in the corner
[1:19:07] <Harthrul> el hermano's outfit is the same as jiren's, but with blue instead of red
[1:19:07] <kratosdestroys> Ginyu The biggest HERO LUL
[1:19:08] <+BorinCorran> El Hermano is a Blue Jiren with a yellow head.
[1:19:08] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> "The Zero Mortal Plan" Goku Black is just Space Hitler 2
[1:19:08] <+horsey_sauce_> jiren isnt a vilain tho
[1:19:09] <+Rust_Wick> pick shaggy blanco
[1:19:10] <arcaderabbit48> Wait, is Jiren voiced by Kana from Pillars of Eternity?
[1:19:11] <majindusto> Blue
[1:19:12] <Cranky_Construct> There's a mod for el hermano already apparently
[1:19:12] <morow1ec> Ginyu was a goku for a while does it count ?
[1:19:15] <+Mateus84723> EL HERMANO DE JIREN
[1:19:15] <MyNameIsRasus> That's too good of a pallete swap to be El Hermano
[1:19:16] <Gutsandlove> i wish there was good android 21 skin
[1:19:16] <Zombrocom> It's a grab
[1:19:18] <%Solidnick18> yoo the ginyu force
[1:19:20] <shockmaster3> its a command grab
[1:19:20] <KeiPrime> the deal with jiren is he's really strong
[1:19:20] <Vashido22> it's a ki blast counter
[1:19:20] <%FrostMass22> Is Ginyu technically another Goku?
[1:19:20] <%genowyn> They should put Meruem in this game

[1:19:27] <AntChodeny> Look up かくげー! / Fighting Games on youtube. I just stole his tech to learn how to Jiren
[1:19:28] <KiraKamixephos> It’s a grab
[1:19:28] <The_Butterfly_Man> is Jiren even really a bad guy?
[1:19:29] <+Demerson13> Woolie has really let himself go there
[1:19:29] <pillowwasp> He’s strong pat
[1:19:29] <Vashido22> Oh the 5H

[1:19:45] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Really? That's...all ya got Jiren? FailFish
[1:19:46] <+Irridium> it's a grab that throws them full-screen
[1:19:46] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> PIKKON iS MORE INTERESTING THAN JIREN DansGame
[1:19:46] <+Yokuho> worth?
[1:19:48] <moogleboy1984> does the El Hermano mod alter the hitbox of his giant fucking skull?

[1:19:51] <+Moaradin> wtf they didnt even make dialogue for jiren and goku?
[1:19:54] <%valriot> HE SO STRONG
[1:19:57] <%theslippybrit> goku - a sportsman to a fault
[1:20:01] <arcaderabbit48> So when is Ultra Instinct Goku being added?
[1:20:01] <%SvenHolgersson> Broly has like the same move
[1:20:02] <neooneshin> 4chna /a/ memes
[1:20:03] <+tigerfang86> PREDICTABO
[1:20:06] <nina9669> HIS NUMBER IS SO BIG

[1:20:07] <vingadivo> big number battle
[1:20:09] <dakuman13> almost canon
[1:20:09] <faegbeard> el grande padre
[1:20:11] <$TehPryceIsRight> vanish after command grab and do auto combo for extension
[1:20:13] <+BorinCorran> Remember kids, we could've had Toppo yelling about Justice, shooting finger lasers, and becoming a God of Destruction for his Level 3.
[1:20:14] <RiceeFTW> that 2H is so violent LMAO
[1:20:15] <MyNameIsRasus> broke: El hermano; Woke: El padre Grande
[1:20:15] <Vashido22> THAT'S DIO VOICE BTW
[1:20:16] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> @Sphincter_Spelunker Holy shit, someone other than me remembers Pikon!
[1:20:17] <JZPotter> Damn, Pat, you're kickin' ass!
[1:20:17] <+C0MTRYA> Canon PogChamp
[1:20:22] <DSD24> Jiren's voice is cool at least
[1:20:27] <%dking0000> He even has a boring stance
[1:20:28] <Animedingo> Superman Uchiha
[1:20:29] <nina9669> true
[1:20:29] <majindusto> Jiren is Dio
[1:20:31] <PinkCatHime> @BorinCorran toppo was so cool
[1:20:31] <dakuman13> gotta wait for ultra instinct goku ya know
[1:20:31] <%SvenHolgersson> I love his red ki
[1:20:34] <nutimik> meh his voice is also kinda boring
[1:20:37] <%CrimsonCore90> He's so lame...
[1:20:40] <synthcutter> boring
[1:20:40] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> Pats kickin ass and chewin ass, and he's all out of ass
[1:20:42] <%Rhinoprotoss> TAG
[1:20:43] <moogleboy1984> Jiren is a rich white girl, confirmed
[1:20:45] <dekkitout> its not boring enough, oddly
[1:20:45] <arcaderabbit48> So is Jiren psychic? Is that what his rapid-hit move is?
[1:20:46] <majindusto> I think
[1:20:46] <%ArcanumMBD> Seeing low level play like this that's on my level is a refreshing change of pace from getting matched against a pink square and getting absolutely stomped.
[1:20:46] <%dking0000> He might as well be T Posing
[1:20:47] <shockmaster3> thats an overhead
[1:20:47] <+mecha_11> Y'all are trying so hard to act like ya'll weren't stanning for Jiren when he first showed up.
[1:20:47] <HalcyonJon> Stance and design is boring but moves look cool.
[1:20:47] <+BorinCorran> @PinkCatHime He was a weird walrus man, it was hype af.
[1:20:48] <MyNameIsRasus> Jiren fucking Pucci's asshole when
[1:20:50] <%CrimsonCore90> Not even in the Brolly kind of lame
[1:20:52] <Vashido22> @nutimik You calling Dio, Ragna and Scorpion voice boring?
[1:20:52] <Jon64s> Dio but not cool
[1:20:53] <SpookySpaghooti> I wanna see Paige play this
[1:20:54] <$Mendin> I am Goku and so can you
[1:20:56] <DrkJP520> Weren't they gonna add ToP arena, or was that xenoverse?
[1:21:01] <nutimik> I call all english anime dubs boring
[1:21:03] <DocMadfox> Kill that Goku, he's black! Wait...
[1:21:06] <braincraft> The thing is, I like dub Goku and Vegeta better, but almost every other voice I prefer the originals.
[1:21:09] <synthcutter> YES
[1:21:12] <Vashido22> YES
[1:21:14] <%JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> she'd break her wrists
[1:21:15] <shockmaster3> she would probably do better
[1:21:16] <%MrBorisMakarov> YEYEYE
[1:21:16] <Gutsandlove> yes
[1:21:16] <%ElenaManetta> oh god somebody talk
[1:21:16] <braincraft> I'm just not into grandma Goku.
[1:21:17] <Nevicate> Hold your fire! This man isn't black
[1:21:17] <MyNameIsRasus> YES
[1:21:19] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @AmaniIsYourBoss I may or may not have bought his Bruce Faulconer theme way back when... Maybe
[1:21:20] <Vashido22> yeyeyeye
[1:21:22] <$TehPryceIsRight> Team Big Boi with Jiren, Cooler, Android 16 has little synergy and you get fuzzied all day but its fun as shit.
[1:21:22] <arcaderabbit48> Her fingers would shatter on contact
[1:21:23] <Nashingbuttons> I mostly prefer dub.
[1:21:24] <+Irridium> oh right you can charge ki in this game
[1:21:25] <alex_id> Wait. that's not Paige????
[1:21:26] <dakuman13> i miss the t pose

[1:21:28] <moogleboy1984> this dude making Scythes look uncool...
[1:21:29] <$cureneckbeard> I thought that was Paige
[1:21:29] <%KaironFortressKnight> HOW CAN THIS BE
[1:21:30] <%VanaSkiller> HOW CAN THIS BE
[1:21:32] <+phatmac16> Leave her alone
[1:21:32] <+TastySammiches> dragon ball is the only anime I've watched where the dub is generally waaay better than the original
[1:21:33] <nutimik> Goku is an exception, horrible japanese voice
[1:21:34] <+BorinCorran> Fun fact. In JP Goku Blacks voice work was apparently super hot to female viewers. Reminder Goku is voice by an old woman.

[1:39:45] <%LogothX> There should be a filler arc in which Jiren tries very hard to develop a personality
[1:39:49] <%Rhinoprotoss> Just jump after you knock them in the air....
[1:39:57] <DSD24> @RCtiger0 Pretty sure Pat is player 1 and Fuggins is 2
[1:40:03] <%GohanEgret> @RCtiger0 1 is pat, 2 is fuggins

[1:40:13] <+Moaradin> its the best

[1:40:15] <dekkitout> its a cool trick
[1:40:17] <%KaironFortressKnight> I thought that spin was a meme
[1:40:18] <%ArcanumMBD> the spin is the only personality Jiren has
[1:40:18] <waifoong98> Not all moves are good Pat LUL
[1:40:19] <Luvinsus> It's the slot machine spin from episode 111
[1:40:24] <EMP_Ike_Turner> SPIN 2 WIN
[1:40:25] <+Rust_Wick> is 17 the worst char in the game or is that bs i head?

[1:43:44] <%HRDSalami654> Jiren is the worst.
[1:43:44] <mAceOfHearts> Is Jiren voiced by Patrick Seitz? Sounds pretty good.
[1:43:49] <buffmurffy> this game desperately needs hercule and roshi
[1:43:50] <%TehPryceIsRight> @Millia_Sparkle Oh it's super dumb. You have to embrace it and not be like all the rage quitters.
[1:43:50] <AmericanaRed> Moobot slashing the Mofos

[1:44:10] <CalderGaming> this is awkward
[1:44:13] <%TehPryceIsRight> Jiren's corner air combo can end with a 2S+2H for hard knock.
[1:44:13] <majindusto> One Cheelai, TWO BROLY'S

[1:46:42] <%HRDSalami654> This is a better fight than the actual show. lol
[1:46:54] <%kabermano> Oh hey Doxy is streaming anime tiddies
[1:46:56] <%TehPryceIsRight> @Millia_Sparkle Some good assists really beef up her neutral. And knowing with 17 call out to do. I just stick with Jiren, Cooler, Android 16, Android 21, and Vegito because the neutral is solid and the combos are fun. Plus I just like them all.
[1:46:57] <Millia_Sparkle> @BorinCorran i hate the multiple copies of gokus/vegeta/ gogeta

[1:47:56] <AmericanaRed> when's toaster?
[1:47:58] <Millia_Sparkle> @TehPryceIsRight Vegito almost dumb dumb depending on player. Literally mash l for auto correct. 18 really depends. I just try to recreate pseudo millia oki
[1:47:58] <%TehPryceIsRight> HE DID IT
[1:47:59] <+Rust_Wick> lul

[1:48:23] <djbrooks603> @yourliteraldog I didn't personally keep up with super and saw it. I would say pretty accessible as long as you have a brief understanding of DB
[1:48:26] <RiceeFTW> good ol bruce lee 2-inch punch
[1:48:27] <%Sulliman34> whos on the couch with pat, fuggins?
[1:48:32] <+badchoice5> Jiren is not fancy
[1:48:33] <korpocalypse> is this hilarious?
[1:48:33] <nepwar> ye
[1:48:38] <korpocalypse> fair enough
[1:48:40] <zecht89> even his lv3 is boring as shit

[1:48:45] <+phatmac16> What about Chilled
[1:48:45] <TheGershon> The only cool thing about Jiren is that it took Ultra Instinct to beat him. That's it
[1:48:47] <korpocalypse> lol
[1:48:47] <%mostundesired> SO MUCH GOKU
[1:48:48] <%TehPryceIsRight> @Millia_Sparkle Vegito and Bardock are the most braindead in neutral because of the auto combo mash. Vegito's meter gain is just so damn high.
[1:48:51] <sileo_patronus> Stop hittingyourself
[1:48:52] <%apostateCourier> maximum gokus
[1:48:54] <%Solidnick18> finally goku

[1:48:55] <42nfl19> Fuggins and Paige is there with pat, she is sitting in the middle
[1:48:57] <bushbabyomega> I'm hoping for Roshi in Season 2, otherwise it would be funny if he was an announcer that got excited with a girl on screen
[1:48:57] <arcaderabbit48> Remember when Woolie was talkign on the podcast way back. He mentione dhow they ahd to wait for Jiren to show off more of his stuff before he could be added to the game as DLC. Well, they waited. And look at all the NOTHING he had in the show.
[1:48:58] <yourliteraldog> Bitches love goku

[1:49:08] <nepwar> can't call it mirror match if they have their own slots
[1:49:10] <DrkJP520> "I'll be sure to visit your grave". Not very goku-like
[1:49:12] <b1gboss007> @sulliman34 that's pat nobody txap

[1:49:20] <%theslippybrit> he'd be in for a fuggin
[1:49:20] <%ElenaManetta> Man, this capsule world in DBZ is so cool. Too bad it's wasted and never used because they always fight in wastelands or some grassy field.
[1:49:21] <%Solidnick18> It's good pat

[1:54:08] <derekwst3> i guess ill watch it eventually
[1:54:09] <majindusto> OH SHIT
[1:54:15] <+badchoice5> Remember Fuggins, just keep banging your head against it til you win once, that;s the DBZ way!
[1:54:17] <thesw1tch> @bushbabyomega again, vegeta would probably end up blowing up whatever bulma makes, like think of when metal cooler tried taking vegeta and gokus energy and blew up. bulma will never be... cooler
[1:54:17] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> Friendship over with Red Bull, now Salad fingers is Pat's bestfriend
[1:54:19] <Dral54> Pat - Fuggins is a pretty rough matchup
[1:54:20] <+KaratePencilcase> Nappa is top tier
[1:54:20] <ShichiNoBushi> No one's been Nappa.
[1:54:20] <%theslippybrit> wait, there are mountain tops?! find me a mountain top i need people to hear this
[1:54:20] <+SuichiTanaka> LUL
[1:54:21] <muchogracias> 17 vs krillin PogChamp

[1:54:36] <%dking0000> Holy Shit broly is MASSIVE
[1:54:39] <%MANDRAGORAROOT> NotLikeThis
[1:54:39] <DSD24> Look at that descending order of heits
[1:54:40] <%Sulliman34> 17 has to work really hard for his damage and its just not worth it. no tools for neutral either
[1:54:40] <RiceeFTW> @AngriestPat Android 18's level 3 also switches out android 17 with Krillin if he's on your team
[1:54:40] <%ElenaManetta> Starbarians also released it's latest episode, so I guess everything impossible will eventually release in the world EXCEPT Half Life 3
[1:54:41] <vingadivo> 17 is barely taller than kuririn
[1:54:41] <Kilagn> BROLY BROLY BROLY

[1:55:01] <%GarbageNirvana> He big
[1:55:01] <CalderGaming> he's basically the dee jay of dragon ball z
[1:55:03] <%TehPryceIsRight> @Millia_Sparkle It helps to find one person with fair matches and hope they keep rematching. Cowarding out is a legitimate strategy
[1:55:04] <person181> savage 17
[1:55:07] <TheGershon> Park Ranger
[1:55:07] <Boxbunnytheliar> Broly is the strongest (also is only the way he is becase Goku cried SO MUCH)

[1:55:14] <buffmurffy> broly and jiren are the same, but at least broly is hilarious. jiren doesnt even have that
[1:55:15] <+REMlesstv> 17 is the worst character in the game
[1:55:16] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Something Island Ranger?
[1:55:16] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> 18 saw LUL
[1:55:18] <bushbabyomega> @thesw1tch But who's to say Whis can't give her some of that ToP stage material for a five course meal?
[1:55:19] <%Solidnick18> woolieMIRIN
[1:55:19] <Sol_Install> old broly is bad
[1:55:21] <RiceeFTW> stubby vs stubbier

[1:55:22] <dekkitout> his ex or his daughter?
[1:55:22] <+badchoice5> You know how people have different amounts of power? Imagine the maximum amount of that. That's Jiren.
[1:55:25] <Sol_Install> super new broly is better
[1:55:26] <zecht89> monster island ranger
[1:55:26] <nawleenspoboy> i almost wanna call vegeta goku but i just don't think so

[1:55:31] <$spardanwarrior> Daughter
[1:55:34] <sileo_patronus> God Krillin deserves the world

[1:55:37] <%Prism_Wing> @dekkitout both Kappa
[1:55:39] <%Remery_> Krillin fucked all the bitches
[1:55:40] <$cureneckbeard> krillin short like pat
[1:55:41] <ShichiNoBushi> Have Gohan and Videl vs Krillin and 18 and have a couples fight.
[1:55:43] <ArtThouBored> Old Broly is MAXIMUM
[1:55:44] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> stayhyBottle Welcome to SHBv5: Mod+ can now type !emotehydrate to toggle emote mode when sending hydration reminders. Also your settings may now be changed from my chat while you are offline.
[1:55:48] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> Krillin being a cop was just a cover up
[1:55:48] <%theslippybrit> krillin so clumsy he got those dots from an extended rake shot
[1:55:49] <person181> krillin girls are watching
[1:55:50] <+Rust_Wick> who best daughteru, marron, bra, or pan?
[1:55:51] <Millia_Sparkle> @TehPryceIsRight nah i take them. You get ppl msging you ggs and useful info sometimes if youre stay in. Typical East Coast Youtube sorta thing.
[1:55:55] <CalderGaming> CANADIAN SPARKING
[1:55:58] <majindusto> Pan
[1:55:58] <%dking0000> Watching 18 reminds me of Black Panther in Infinite, that makes me sad
[1:55:59] <person181> marron
[1:56:01] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Wait, what. Krillin's daughter is named after the floozie he dated before 18
[1:56:02] <%bluetocho13> Pan
[1:56:06] <reiju_22> SourPls
[1:56:07] <person181> yep
[1:56:10] <dekkitout> yeah
[1:56:11] <%GarbageNirvana> I never have the presence of mind for this game to be able to effectively use afterimage
[1:56:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> That's fucked
[1:56:15] <moogleboy1984> Krillin may only have a six inch dick, but it's literally 1/5th of his body
[1:56:16] <NumberTooBig> @dking0000 it also makes Max sad Kappa
[1:56:21] <dekkitout> yeah-
[1:56:23] <+Rust_Wick> vacheetah
[1:56:23] <%Rawklobstah88> You can tell he's stronger because he's blue
[1:56:24] <Millia_Sparkle> @TehPryceIsRight the waiting for a highlighted rematch then they leave is annoying tho lol
[1:56:25] <%MANDRAGORAROOT> PATHETIC
[1:56:26] <TheGershon> Maron isn't canon
[1:56:34] <$cureneckbeard> pat shave your head and cosplay Krillin. Paige cosplay Android 18. Elmo as Krillin's kid
[1:56:34] <%Sulliman34> i find it funny that SSJ goku and vegeta are better than their SSGSS forms
[1:56:38] <Millia_Sparkle> Maron tits are huge
[1:56:40] <%GingaNZ> more mash during the super
[1:56:41] <%apostateCourier> different inputs do different things for kaioken
[1:56:45] <ShichiNoBushi> Chichi needs to be in the game so the many Gokus could have a wife to team up with.
[1:56:46] <+AverageBlubber> No the names are completely different, don't fuck it up or 18'll get pissed
[1:56:46] <dekkitout> neither is gt, but the merchandise says otherwise
[1:56:47] <%apostateCourier> mix it up
[1:56:54] <Millia_Sparkle> @apostateCourier thats high lvl tech there
[1:56:56] <%ElenaManetta> You know, they could just change Super to be random fights by comp players and I don't think anyone would notice.
[1:56:59] <%apostateCourier> the damage is higher if you never repeat :D
[1:57:03] <DonatelloJose> Yooo chi chi would be legit
[1:57:04] <%GarbageNirvana> God, what if they started bringing GT stuff into this game
[1:57:11] <nepwar> less than 2 minutes and salad fingers has shook me more than anything in 2018
[1:57:11] <%Prism_Wing> @shichinobushi or against
[1:57:13] <Millia_Sparkle> hes losing 18. she too technical
[1:57:14] <person181> 18 always look so good
[1:57:15] <+Rust_Wick> i mean
[1:57:16] <%TehPryceIsRight> @Millia_Sparkle Yeah its a 50/50 shot on whether they actually had to go or if its BM making you watch the clock run down
[1:57:19] <%Sulliman34> it has a vaccum effect up close pat
[1:57:20] <DonatelloJose> We don’t talk about GT anymore
[1:57:21] <mayorrev> @angriestpat have you seen the mod that turns Hit into Captain Falcon?
[1:57:22] <+badchoice5> Because HIS POWER IS MAXIMUM
[1:57:23] <majindusto> The Floozie is Maron...Krillins Daughter is Marron
[1:57:26] <%dking0000> I wouldn't be suprised if we see Omega Shenron of SSJ4 at some point
[1:57:26] <dekkitout> oh you know you all love super saiyan 4
[1:57:26] <+Rust_Wick> i wouldnt mind seeing omega shenron, baby is eh
[1:57:32] <person181> but SSJ4
[1:57:35] <%ECRead> @angriestpat the uppercut is a hit
[1:57:36] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Caesar or Caesar
[1:57:37] <%Remery_> Broly slapping wives left and right
[1:57:37] <Finakala> Man Broly is HUGE
[1:57:37] <KiraKamixephos> you’re supposed to combo into it
[1:57:42] <thesw1tch> @bushbabyomega my dude, they blew up the stage that not one but two literal gods of everything. whis probably could find something though for them and I bet you actually predicted a future plot point
[1:57:47] <%dking0000> Hell I think Baby Vegeta isn't too awful a design
[1:57:48] <leole11> has to be real close tho
[1:57:50] <+Rust_Wick> broly slaps them tits
[1:57:52] <%Sulliman34> you have to be like in their mouth
[1:57:52] <%apostateCourier> SICK
[1:57:56] <%GarbageNirvana> I know this'll never happen, but I still wanna see Bulma get some action somehow
[1:58:01] <%GarbageNirvana> Like she could just build a fight robot
[1:58:04] <muchogracias> 17 LUL
[1:58:04] <Millia_Sparkle> @TehPryceIsRight well once you get used to it its not too bad. just says the opponents a coward and you move on. wish i could exit faster and find someone nxt. hvnt played for a while tho
[1:58:04] <%theslippybrit> broly, smacking your bitch from across the screen
[1:58:09] <%Prism_Wing> I love it when people have a vaccuum effect up close.
[1:58:12] <+badchoice5> Is this the Krillin that isn't even immune to bullets?
[1:58:16] <+MightySandwich> Lord Krillin
[1:58:16] <%Remery_> Krillin throws rocks like a animal
[1:58:17] <%Sulliman34> pat just sitting on meter for that big GENKIDAMA
[1:58:18] <%apostateCourier> she could build an exoskeleton based on 17 & 18 or something :v
[1:58:26] <+Rust_Wick> broly smacks your gfs ass, what do?
[1:58:31] <+abadbadman> Krillian says Eat Ass
[1:58:33] <%Sulliman34> do the level 3 patrick
[1:58:33] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Smack his ass
[1:58:35] <jellymang> GET IM KRILL]
[1:58:38] <%ECRead> Broly my boy <3 I'm glad I get 2 of him. if not 3.
[1:58:38] <Millia_Sparkle> @Sulliman34 this man with the reads

[1:58:49] <thesw1tch> happy birthday!
[1:58:49] <%dking0000> @Rust_Wick Cry like a baby and watch him freak out and run away
[1:58:51] <bushbabyomega> @thesw1tch I'm also predicting a universal conflict-- a threat that's big to the multiverse so that the other ToP characters return
[1:58:53] <majindusto> KRILLMASTER FTW
[1:58:53] <+Rust_Wick> lul
[1:58:56] <dekkitout> pure of heart!
[1:58:59] <Millia_Sparkle> omfg winnnnn
[1:58:59] <RiceeFTW> it's really hard to combo into too LOL
[1:59:00] <buffmurffy> krillin's not pure, he couldnt fly on nimbus
[1:59:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Huh
[1:59:04] <$cureneckbeard> abipopPANTSU
[1:59:04] <jellymang> NOOOOOOOOO
[1:59:05] <+Robopengy> Man these dropped combos
[1:59:05] <%Sulliman34> goku has a natural combo for it. i believe its 236S?
[1:59:05] <+badchoice5> LUL
[1:59:06] <%GohanEgret> F

[1:59:13] <+badchoice5> PATS POWER IS MAXIMUM
[1:59:14] <+enickma11> Threw it away :(
[1:59:14] <%Remery_> Krillin :(
[1:59:14] <%Prism_Wing> goddammit
[1:59:17] <%GarbageNirvana> How can I hold all these combos
[1:59:18] <+abadbadman> could have sworn Vegeta as some health left
[1:59:19] <CalderGaming> krillin was a straight up thug in OG dragonball
[1:59:19] <arcaderabbit48> Krillin doesn't have a puire heart! Do you have any idea what he and his robot wife get up to in the bedroom!?
[1:59:20] <%ElenaManetta> Goku is cute when he smiles
[1:59:22] <sileo_patronus> Got some good hits in though fugg
[1:59:22] <%bluetocho13> Fuggins you choked
[1:59:23] <KiraKamixephos> :(
[1:59:23] <%JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> btw if you mash when you're doing a dragon rush, you punch more
[1:59:24] <%Sulliman34> you have to charge the 236S somehow though
[1:59:25] <%theslippybrit> @ElenaManetta i looked away and i honestly thought you said "nice anilingus"
[1:59:27] <AggsMK7> Elmo v Fuggins when?
[1:59:29] <%MANDRAGORAROOT> qcf
[1:59:29] <NumberTooBig> man, if only base for goku and vegeta could... not be here
[1:59:31] <%Sulliman34> i think 214S charges it up to two times
[1:59:32] <%Buttface_> 236S only goes into it if fully charged
[1:59:33] <%TehPryceIsRight> @Millia_Sparkle Yeah just gotta get used to the online shenanigans of making you wait, rage quitting, etc.
[1:59:35] <NumberTooBig> no one would be better
[1:59:36] <+PolarBearPat> tatsu
[1:59:36] <Dral54> Last 19 rounds were just data! This time for sure
[1:59:36] <+thackattack00> just tag in spirit bomb after using beerus lvl 1 in the air ez
[1:59:37] <Millia_Sparkle> omg half circle forward
[1:59:37] <%Rawklobstah88> QCF S
[1:59:38] <leole11> one of the hits in kaioken mode is a grab, in case the enemy is blocking
[1:59:39] <mAceOfHearts> Quartercircle forward projectile
[1:59:43] <zecht89> keep on mashing for that L fuggins
[1:59:44] <%apostateCourier> I thought it was qcb
[1:59:44] <Millia_Sparkle> quarter*
[1:59:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Turns out a pure heart doesn't prevent Goku from caving your chest in
[1:59:47] <LibriJamm> You can also use it as a read on fullscreen superdash.
[1:59:49] <KaiserCaes> When Pat said "It will work" I was expecting Crazy Talk to activate
[1:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:59:56] <Sol_Install> QCF to charge it to max
[1:59:58] <+Raidou24> Thats his 1 handed spirit bomb
[1:59:58] <DrkJP520> A fully charged small genkidama followed by the lv3
[1:59:58] <%Kirbachev> I mean Krillin bried Roshi with porn mags back in DB. He ain't pure in the slightest LUL
[1:59:59] <%ElenaManetta> dRINK SOME WATER, BITCH
[2:00:02] <%Kirbachev> bribed*
[2:00:06] <mayorrev> DRINK BITCH
[2:00:09] <%NWR_James> KICK HIS ASS, FUG-LORD

[2:00:17] <+Rust_Wick> gingah powah
[2:00:17] <$cureneckbeard> lore
[2:00:21] <bushbabyomega> Just a widdle sip
[2:00:23] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> Finally, Pat is the Woolie
[2:00:23] <%theslippybrit> dont drink too much tho, lest you get addicted
[2:00:23] <+cappyd33> ooooooooh
[2:00:24] <rubbishbinge> The salt is making him dehydrated :(
[2:00:28] <+Rust_Wick> beard amps pats power
[2:00:33] <%Sulliman34> what a shit level 3
[2:00:34] <%kabermano> That just sounds like you're bad at NOT hurting people Fuggins
[2:00:36] <RiceeFTW> @AngriestPat without a very specific setup, goku can only combo into spirit bomb if he has full charge mini spirit bomb
[2:00:37] <%dking0000> How will your number get to big if you don't Hydrate?
[2:00:39] <nawleenspoboy> after all these character additions i bet they release two complete editions
[2:00:43] <Millia_Sparkle> @TehPryceIsRight i prefer long fights with harder players. its not tht bad. Orange is the legit average players. Red is optimal corner carries and incredible reads
[2:00:48] <majindusto> Paige a #18!!!
[2:00:53] <majindusto> as
[2:00:53] <KiraKamixephos> Ded
[2:00:59] <arcaderabbit48> Krillin is one of the coolest characters in this game specifically because he isn't a monstrously powerful freakbeast. He has to use actual skills and techniques rather than just "punch good, or punch gooder"
[2:01:00] <%Remery_> Krillin hides from Broly :/
[2:01:04] <%NWR_James> Broly looks so stupid next to 18
[2:01:14] <+badchoice5> Fuggins' only chance is to exploit Pat's lust for shitty grabs
[2:01:15] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> Trunks hides from Broly
[2:01:16] <%apostateCourier> aw I was hoping for the dragon rush
[2:01:19] <%theslippybrit> broly looks so stupid.... no im done
[2:01:21] <%apostateCourier> 2stronk of a move
[2:01:21] <Millia_Sparkle> @TehPryceIsRight my stubborness ruined me in guilty gear lol. im doomed to dbz only now
[2:01:23] <%ElenaManetta> I'm half paying attention, why does it randomly say "chase" on the side. That's not a fighting game term!
[2:01:28] <+terry_quest> is new broly out yet?
[2:01:30] <%Remery_> @Darlington_the_Deceiver Princess Trunks
[2:01:30] <%NWR_James> Broly skips leg day
[2:01:30] <%Sulliman34> oh pat, if you get someone into a combo with broly and dont use your smash, your jH will pull them back to the ground
[2:01:31] <sileo_patronus> @arcaderabbit48 He's also just a good guy
[2:01:35] <%ultimatetotoro> guys, how much different do you think super brolys quotes will be from this one when he comes out?
[2:01:36] <%LogothX> He just said "how can this beeee"
[2:01:39] <%GarbageNirvana> So does anyone else think it's fucked up that Krillin named her daughter after an ex or
[2:01:41] <DrkJP520> Oh god. Who told these Eng VAs to say "sora"?
[2:01:42] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> @Remery_ right LUL
[2:01:43] <%Rawklobstah88> Why is everyone asking if New Broly is out?
[2:01:46] <%ultimatetotoro> because he doesn't....say much of anything
[2:01:46] <bushbabyomega> @elenamanetta For flying into the opponent
[2:01:47] <arcaderabbit48> @sileo_patronus He is! and a great husband from what I hear
[2:01:51] <TheCrook92> has an assist been called this whole time? LUL
[2:01:52] <Paradocks23> How's he like the game?
[2:01:52] <Vashido22> @DrkJP520 ikr
[2:01:57] <Wobuzhidao> Shueisha told them to say Sora
[2:01:58] <Millia_Sparkle> @GarbageNirvana no its kinky. its just 1k year old dragon
[2:01:59] <%Sulliman34> i guess it is 214S, qcb pat
[2:02:04] <london_flexing> uptime!
[2:02:10] <%LogothX> Say ORA ORA ORA
[2:02:13] <london_flexing> !uptime
[2:02:13] <%NWR_James> !uptime
[2:02:13] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 2m.
[2:02:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> !uptime
[2:02:15] <wolftundra> lol that Goku scream
[2:02:15] <Gutsandlove> the lowest goku vs the highest vegeta
[2:02:19] <$KnivesEve> @GarbageNirvana na toriyama probably forgot
[2:02:24] <Millia_Sparkle> this fights going so bad pats just learning rn lol
[2:02:28] <+cappyd33> a rose by any other name is still goku
[2:02:28] <%apostateCourier> you need to charge it to full
[2:02:32] <%TehPryceIsRight> @Millia_Sparkle Yeah I was in that threat level for a while. Stressed me out too much with optimal 5 minute combos, godlike reads, and TODs. Couldn't take the heat.
[2:02:32] <%Sulliman34> has to be fully charged sadly
[2:02:32] <shockmaster3> just fully charge it
[2:02:33] <dekkitout> "Face it, Kakarot, I've achieved a power beyond Super Sai- 'Kaio-Ken' Kaio-oh shit..."
[2:02:33] <Vashido22> that won't work
[2:02:40] <Sol_Install> fully charge
[2:02:41] <RiceeFTW> @AngriestPat without a very specific setup, goku can only combo into spirit bomb if he has full charge mini spirit bomb
[2:02:42] <Zombrocom> @AngriestPat You need a fully charged mini spirit bomb to combo into big spirit bomb solo, otherwise you need an assist or DHC
[2:02:45] <%Sulliman34> hold the S on the 214
[2:02:46] <Dral54> Stay hydrated Bitch!
[2:02:48] <%apostateCourier> generally takes an assist to do it safely
[2:02:48] <Vashido22> you have to charge it
[2:02:49] <KiraKamixephos> Has to be fully charged
[2:02:50] <%apostateCourier> and it's a hold
[2:02:53] <shockmaster3> you need to fully chargg
[2:02:54] <%ElenaManetta> cute goku again
[2:02:55] <Millia_Sparkle> @TehPryceIsRight omg tod lol gotta force tht meter
[2:02:55] <+FlubbedPig> @AngriestPat Fun Fact: The explanation for Super Broly's power is that he's subconsciously using the power of Great Ape form without transforming. That is to say, he's basically doing Super Saiyan 4 in Base.
[2:02:55] <Vashido22> hold the button
[2:02:55] <+Rust_Wick> hold that shit
[2:02:56] <Zombrocom> Hold it
[2:02:56] <Sloavon> \o/
[2:02:57] <RiceeFTW> hold it for longer
[2:02:57] <+Irridium> hold the button!
[2:02:58] <+LilNatFour> it has 3 stages
[2:03:00] <%ECRead> it charges. hold button
[2:03:00] <zmuno> wooow.. krilin lose...
[2:03:03] <%ElenaManetta> that's the next kingdom hearts title
[2:03:04] <spacecatstreams> just go even further beyond
[2:03:06] <%Buttface_> 214[S]
[2:03:08] <+abadbadman> gotta have a big small bomb
[2:03:08] <Millia_Sparkle> huggins folding
[2:03:08] <+Haarute> When you ask for energy, hold it.
[2:03:09] <%theslippybrit> @AngriestPat get wet bruh
[2:03:09] <%Rhinoprotoss> It means charge, dummy
[2:03:12] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Rust_Wick) (warning)
[2:03:14] <jackelzxaa> Hold the ki button don to keep charging
[2:03:15] <+badchoice5> You need at least 1000 viewers to raise their hands and lend you their energy
[2:03:16] <%NWR_James> Spirit Bomb should take 5 rounds to charge
[2:03:17] <%ultimatetotoro> it just means to hold the shit pat
[2:03:18] <%theAncopro> qc back + s
[2:03:18] <%apostateCourier> base form Goku is a very technical character
[2:03:23] <JanusII> There you go.
[2:03:26] <Millia_Sparkle> omgggg lol i cant with this match
[2:03:27] <braincraft> If you use Goku's 214S and hold S, the chargeup lasts longer and powers up the spirit bomb, up to 3 levels.
[2:03:29] <+lethallunacyx> lol fuggins
[2:03:30] <%ultimatetotoro> hold it like you hold elmo!
[2:03:30] <RiceeFTW> it also gives a shit ton of meter
[2:03:37] <KiraKamixephos> We can help you too fuggs
[2:03:37] <deviljhojho94> Is pat just krillin? He is a short, orange dwarf with a hot, varely alive girlfriend
[2:03:38] <%ultimatetotoro> apatWink
[2:03:46] <jackelzxaa> You can charge it like 3 times
[2:03:46] <%apostateCourier> the whiff
[2:03:47] <$cureneckbeard> yes
[2:03:47] <Millia_Sparkle> @deviljhojho94 agreed
[2:03:51] <$cureneckbeard> pat krillin cosplay when
[2:03:52] <%apostateCourier> the axe throw off the cliff
[2:03:52] <arcaderabbit48> Poor Fuggins had no diea he'd be used as Pat's self-esteem punching bag
[2:03:53] <braincraft> The powered-up bomb does more damage and much more hitstun, which gives you enough time to cancel into his level 3.
[2:03:54] <majindusto> Apearently, YES!
[2:03:54] <TheIncoherentGamer> Alright we help Pat now to help Figgins
[2:03:55] <%Sulliman34> rip the dream
[2:03:57] <Ion_LaserX> @deviljhojho94 Yep
[2:03:59] <+Rust_Wick> i want an energy drink called spirit bomb tbh
[2:04:02] <+badchoice5> Why does Pat refuse to switch?
[2:04:06] <braincraft> Tell Fuggins to block more.
[2:04:07] <%NWR_James> @deviljhojho94 no because Krillin is a productive member of society
[2:04:09] <%apostateCourier> he wanted to do the cool thing
[2:04:10] <%Rhinoprotoss> Train with Woolie to beat Pat
[2:04:11] <RiceeFTW> LMAO that MIX was nasty
[2:04:14] <%Eternal_Nihilism> who's who?
[2:04:15] <Millia_Sparkle> Figgins just mash reflect on wake up and dragon dash all day
[2:04:17] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @deviljhojho94 Nah, Krillin's nice
[2:04:18] <deviljhojho94> @NWR_James Hmm that's a good point
[2:04:21] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Almost CANONICALLY proved that Krillin is stronger than Goku
[2:04:21] <+mistersokar> Anyone else think its weird that Krillin's daughter grows a nose as she gets older?
[2:04:21] <deviljhojho94> also that
[2:04:21] <TheIncoherentGamer> Everyone raise your hands and give Figgins your energy
[2:04:23] <zmuno> Pat and Fuggins are not longer friends....
[2:04:24] <%apostateCourier> I love how Android 17 is literally just Vega
[2:04:29] <jackelzxaa> Tell pat his peepee smells while he isnt looking
[2:04:29] <+Rust_Wick> nah pat gets my energy
[2:04:30] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> @badchoice5 he's winning without it, better to stay on one character and learn them right now
[2:04:31] <Millia_Sparkle> 18 dead
[2:04:33] <majindusto> Why won't Pat DOOOOOODGE?
[2:04:37] <+abadbadman> Pat talking to Paige again
[2:04:44] <dekkitout> 17's spin to win looks rad as shit
[2:04:47] <braincraft> Krillin + rock >>> Goku
[2:04:50] <braincraft> That's canon.
[2:04:51] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Hell Fighter 17
[2:04:52] <%Luna_Ashford> Pat likes pounding on his sister
[2:04:54] <arcaderabbit48> @mistersokar Well her mom has a nose. Does that answer your question or just muddy the situation further?
[2:04:56] <Millia_Sparkle> dude pat feeling himself so much
[2:04:58] <%JJCheeker> where is peepee? i miss him apatWink apatWink apatWink
[2:05:02] <Paradocks23> Climb a thousand miles into the woolie hole to train.
[2:05:08] <TheGershon> Woah, that works so much better
[2:05:08] <+Nomicro4u> Peepee is sleepee
[2:05:09] <%NWR_James> Oh god how did we just now get to the Pat incest jokes with 17/18?
[2:05:11] <%Daxalog> Hhhaaa

[2:05:33] <jackelzxaa> How great is it that 17 of all characters made a comeback in super AND he’s swag as fuck mvp?
[2:05:34] <+AlopekisPup> Why does Vegeta have blue hair? I haven't paid attention to DB in a long time. lol
[2:05:34] <%theslippybrit> learn the woolie roll, first crouch in order to make your opponent uncomfortable
[2:05:36] <%Sulliman34> fuggins! you can mash destructo disk to throw more disks!
[2:05:47] <Burny01> if pat is elmo, then what is Fuggins? and is Elmo Korrin?

[2:06:05] <bushbabyomega> 17's forward special can be followed up with 2S to quickly charge his attack, doing it a second time shoots it
[2:06:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> YEYEYE You can do it Fuggins!

[2:07:40] <+dynanite> @AlopekisPup That is the legit english name. The japanese one is ss blue
[2:07:42] <+Nomicro4u> Pat and Fuggins rub beards together becaue they like the way it feels
[2:07:47] <bushbabyomega> @rust_wick It's like that Kids Book about a fish giving away his scales, but Jiren hogged scales to get swole
[2:07:51] <%Solidnick18> beerus is better now
[2:07:52] <+Rust_Wick> lul
[2:07:55] <Burny01> Clearly we need Nam in this game
[2:07:55] <+MightySandwich> Jiren seems quite solid so far
[2:07:56] <+AlopekisPup> @dynanite The Japanese one actually sounds better. lol
[2:07:56] <Mattmandx1> @The_Proud_Canadian Slow and weird but with high damage combos
[2:07:56] <%dking0000> Jiren is Geese
[2:07:57] <Burny01> Nam was legit
[2:07:59] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Nomicro4u that's how they fuse
[2:07:59] <TyrantBelial> Pat likes people like he likes his own dick, not able to be fully shown on screen.
[2:08:01] <+badchoice5> Now THIS would be an interesting fight
[2:08:02] <NumberTooBig> a beerus that lasted more that 30 seconds DansGame
[2:08:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Nomicro4u That is called brustling and it is not an act to be taken lightly.

[2:08:25] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @dynanite @AlopekisPup They're SS blue in both. They joked about how dumb the name is in the manga
[2:08:27] <DSD24> Heloooo
[2:08:28] <+Rust_Wick> it probably wouldnt sell but, i'd be down for a yakuza fighting game
[2:08:33] <%TehPryceIsRight> @AngriestPat 2S launcher gives a hard knock down so you can just L, L, L to finish it.
[2:08:34] <+The_Proud_Canadian> In canon would Jiren murder Beerus?
[2:08:35] <+badchoice5> You really are tho

[2:09:10] <%Solidnick18> yee
[2:09:12] <%GarbageNirvana> I feel like Beerus has the most shit that people haven't figured out yet
[2:09:13] <%ElenaManetta> i HAVE THE HIGH GROUND
[2:09:17] <RiceeFTW> @The_Proud_Canadian I don't think so, nothing is quite as incredible as Beerus' Hakai on a deity in terms of Dragon Ball strength
[2:09:18] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Vashido22)
[2:09:20] <sileo_patronus> Beerus seems to have some tricksy bullshit
[2:09:21] <Mattmandx1> @AngriestPat If you hit with a ki blast or beam you can vanish and dash forward and keep the combo going
[2:09:23] <dekkitout> You underestimate my power!
[2:09:25] <+MightySandwich> When in doubt, pinky out
[2:09:25] <+badchoice5> Fuggins, just use your god power to instantly destroy Pat
[2:09:27] <+dynanite> @Sphincter_Spelunker Oh I remember it being ssgss in xenoverse
[2:09:28] <%Niney_Who> DISAPPOINTING

[2:10:02] <Ventuss> Is Bojack in this game?

[2:10:04] <%JJCheeker> chat you want some cake?
[2:10:08] <sileo_patronus> Why does Fuggins, the larger of the two, not simply eat Pat?
[2:10:11] <+The_Proud_Canadian> which one has the superior Cold Genes?
[2:10:12] <%MANDRAGORAROOT> yes :)

[2:10:35] <%TehPryceIsRight> @AngriestPat After Cooler's qcb+M, with M followup you can level 1 super.
[2:10:42] <%Niney_Who> Pat is the least charismatic villains while Fuggins is the MOST Charismatic Villains
[2:10:42] <Burny01> the same can be said of Elmo. Not pat eating elmo, the other way around.
[2:10:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Because EVERYONE always quotes it
[2:10:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's from Futurama I think?

[2:12:10] <Dral54> Fuggins, you gotta Do Combo to beat the Pat
[2:12:10] <Millia_Sparkle> pat feeling himself
[2:12:12] <RiceeFTW> @Irridium bottom tier, but Sonic Fox made it work somehow
[2:12:14] <%dking0000> Beerus has the coolest concepts but his gimmicks just don't work real time
[2:12:14] <Millia_Sparkle> pat go home
[2:12:14] <%Niney_Who> Pat may be winning but at least Fuggins has the Fun Characters and not "Boring, Not Frieza, and ANGERY"
[2:12:16] <Nashingbuttons> Did Pat seriously just get the down s launch THREE TIMES and fial to capitalize on all of them?
[2:12:20] <+AlopekisPup> @snow_bush Yeah, there was a lot of WW2 shit back then. lol
[2:12:22] <%FrustratedAF> fuggins needs kaioken
[2:12:24] <MyNameIsRasus> So chat, had to leave for a bit, did Fuggins win any yet?

[2:12:48] <Paradocks23> What will you do without your counter?!
[2:12:49] <%goose_attack_almanac> Because no matter who loses, Fuggins wins

[2:13:02] <+Rust_Wick> pat into kangaroos confirmed
[2:13:03] <+AlopekisPup> I bet Beerus is secretly the most powerful character in the game but has a massive skill gap.
[2:13:03] <Millia_Sparkle> dude woolie already beat pat. he GAVE him the win
[2:13:04] <moogleboy1984> they were the heads on Executioner's belt
[2:13:04] <%Sulliman34> they can get stuffed hard tho
[2:13:12] <%Sulliman34> @AlopekisPup i wish
[2:13:17] <moogleboy1984> I... may have unironically enjoyed Mace
[2:13:18] <%snow_bush> @AlopekisPup I watched it all the time back when I was young/sick There was the "Everything and anything" period, the "World War 2" period, the "Hitler and Random Shit" period, before finally settling on "Ancient Aliens and Pawn Stars" period
[2:13:21] <%Niney_Who> Fun Fact: Kangaroos have Balls ABOVE their dicks
[2:13:24] <RiceeFTW> mm yeah, kinda slow, but I think the range and having a DP makes up for it
[2:13:31] <%MANDRAGORAROOT> thats not fun @Niney_Who
[2:13:36] <+Rust_Wick> pat is a kangabear
[2:13:39] <Millia_Sparkle> dbz in a nutshell. only move with specials
[2:13:39] <%Solidnick18> huh
[2:13:51] <+badchoice5> If Pat goes to Brolly he instantly loses, as he tries to futilely grab over and over
[2:13:52] <%ThatGuyfromMars> pat bestfriends
[2:13:52] <Millia_Sparkle> pat lies he knws what it does

[2:14:05] <+Irridium> that's what it does
[2:14:10] <%GingaNZ> @AngriestPat tell fuggins to do the light mash combos, for mo damage
[2:14:11] <ebonifragaria> @Niney_Who Well that's clearly because they're from Australia, where everything is upside down

[2:14:50] <%crimsonharvest> WHy does Jiren look like a strange alien infant
[2:14:53] <Dakuu75> "kiao-fuggins" lmao
[2:14:56] <%goose_attack_almanac> @Mattmandx1 More because Piccolo also had to teach them it before hand.
[2:14:57] <+Rust_Wick> jiren looks like a fish man
[2:15:02] <+Rust_Wick> a gd fish
[2:15:02] <%Pilzkun> we have now reached the point where pat should suggest they take a break out of respect for the fact that losing repeatedly isn't fun
[2:15:03] <%theslippybrit> watch out pat, we're gonna grab your shit
[2:15:03] <+Irridium> pat is a big liar they have their place.
[2:15:03] <%MANDRAGORAROOT> thats what sphynx cats look like
[2:15:07] <+AlopekisPup> @snow_bush Yeah. I guess they must have been having a loss in viewers so they just tried adding random shit in and ended up with what we have today, unfortunately.
[2:15:07] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@braincraft) (warning)
[2:15:08] <Millia_Sparkle> i hate this fisticuffs so much

[2:15:58] <majindusto> DIE BUG MAN
[2:16:00] <Mattmandx1> I wonder if the King Kais from other universes could teach their denizens thee Kaioken. Would have made the tournament of power more interesting
[2:16:01] <Millia_Sparkle> autocombo mash
[2:16:06] <+abadbadman> he's One Punch Man

[2:16:10] <%Rngiddion> everyone in gt at least had good designs
[2:16:10] <MyNameIsRasus> man*
[2:16:10] <dekkitout> jirren basically beat za warudo
[2:16:11] <Gieron666> i see Pat brought over a noob to make himself look good at fighting games on stream
[2:16:11] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> Jiren replaced GT LUL
[2:16:12] <%NobleJedi> Pat sounds like he's joking, but he's not
[2:16:12] <%Remery_> GT doesn't want Jiren, we already have Pan
[2:16:16] <Burny01> Jiren is strong strong man what is the next ever-moving goalpost
[2:16:16] <TakesGuts> Jiren is literally a super ayy
[2:16:16] <+badchoice5> Just increase his number to infinity then strip away all his other character traits
[2:16:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Leave Frieza to me
[2:16:18] <+Rust_Wick> jiren is an alien fish
[2:16:18] <derekwst3> he is strong guy from a tournament from most of the universes
[2:16:19] <Millia_Sparkle> higgin drop the match man lol
[2:16:19] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> One guy has time stop powers. And Jiren just overpowers it. BECAUSE HE SO STRONG
[2:16:20] <dekkitout> thats how hes stronger than time
[2:16:21] <SleepingDog22> so that's where we're at in DBZ. stronger than time
[2:16:21] <Mr_Floobis> Super is better than GT but Super is still trash
[2:16:22] <%ElenaManetta> oof i almost heard "It's clear you have a DICK wish!"
[2:16:24] <bushbabyomega> Jiren is from an alien species that has high adaptability due to their ocular potency
[2:16:26] <Paradocks23> Wait, is that a thing? Stronger than time?
[2:16:26] <braincraft> To clarify: Hit basically has ZA WARUDO, and Jiren punched so hard he broke the timestop.
[2:16:33] <Millia_Sparkle> yo pats gonna win with a super
[2:16:34] <%TehPryceIsRight> Oof those hard "reads"
[2:16:35] <+j_koh> GT is a spinoff
[2:16:37] <%dking0000> Jiren is so strong he can't have an actual character
[2:16:39] <bushbabyomega> Hence why you see his eyes reflecting before his flurry
[2:16:40] <braincraft> He literally punched time.
[2:16:41] <%Niney_Who> Fuggins Pls use Sparking
[2:16:43] <Millia_Sparkle> wheres tht super
[2:16:44] <%Niney_Who> Oh it's gone
[2:16:46] <%Remery_> GT was a wet dream
[2:16:47] <%dking0000> Having a character makes him weak
[2:16:50] <CrypticMochi> I forget, does Pan even do anything in GT?
[2:16:50] <Millia_Sparkle> omg this is so dumb
[2:16:51] <%Niney_Who> He did use it
[2:16:51] <TheGershon> Jiren's backstory is like a lame Sasuke
[2:16:53] <+j_koh> JIREN IS KRILLEN
[2:16:56] <%Niney_Who> Map is just so red it didn't look like it
[2:16:56] <%theslippybrit> stronger than time and braver than the sun
[2:16:58] <Burny01> Jiren is so strong, even his pants are strong
[2:16:58] <sileo_patronus> He was
[2:17:01] <Mattmandx1> Jiren is way less shitty in the manga to be fair. Toei just doesn't know how to write
[2:17:01] <%jaybombdotcom> Pat you can combo in brolys air grab
[2:17:02] <Zdawg39> big stornk pat
[2:17:03] <%Solidnick18> damn broly

[2:17:05] <jackelzxaa> In before jiren helps goku fight blue goat man in the current manga arc
[2:17:06] <%bluetocho13> I can believe Shaggy will be in MK11 even ed boon is re tweeting
[2:17:06] <Gieron666> @bushbabyomega shut up... none of this was said in the anime
[2:17:06] <DefaultSettiings> but where are the waifus
[2:17:10] <+badchoice5> Fuggins, switch back to Goku team
[2:17:11] <nepwar> he's stronger than character developer
[2:17:11] <jackelzxaa> @angriestpat have you checked out All Systems Goku yet? Jeff Gerstmann and Dan Ryckert are going through all 167 episodes of DBZ Kai and making wrestling jokes the whole way.
[2:17:11] <nina9669> Sasuke is still lame

[2:17:16] <Ventuss> @Paradocks23 he countered Hit's time stop attack
[2:17:16] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I guess I'm the only one who enjoyed GT
[2:17:25] <%Niney_Who> Time for POWERBOMBS
[2:17:28] <%OdysseyKnight> Jiren can't beat base form Shaggy
[2:17:30] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oops all Vegetas

[2:17:31] <%salty_syd913> oops all vegeta!
[2:17:31] <person181> oops all vegitas
[2:17:32] <Burny01> Jiren is what would happen if pat and his stand reached heaven
[2:17:32] <+Bewaretheblood> Wtf does braver than the sun even mean?

[2:17:46] <+AlopekisPup> Is the new sexy android in this?
[2:17:47] <+badchoice5> Jiren is so full of power, there's no room for personality
[2:17:47] <dekkitout> gold cooler is totally a thing
[2:17:48] <%Niney_Who> EWW
[2:17:48] <%dking0000> Android 16 against a team with no gokus is a bad match up
[2:17:49] <eyezehuhh> How's Videl?
[2:17:50] <MyNameIsRasus> Cooler has such an inferiority complex
[2:17:51] <buffmurffy> what if cooler and frieza did fusion?
[2:17:52] <+Irridium> the what based off the what now
[2:17:52] <TheGershon> Golden Cooler in Heroes
[2:17:52] <Paradocks23> @ventuss Like how Goku did it or just... punched through it?

[2:19:03] <MyNameIsRasus> Oh the dunking
[2:19:03] <%dking0000> Jiren looks like the template for a Xenoverse custom character
[2:19:04] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> "I'm a Number!" - Jiren
[2:19:07] <+aslfrasle> PREDICTABO
[2:19:19] <Burny01> despite having a more monotone voice, Android 16 has infinitely more personality than Jiren
[2:19:20] <+Rust_Wick> jiren looks like an npc
[2:19:24] <TheGershon> Remember when Golden Cooler showed up in episode 1 and didn't do shit for like 5 episodes?
[2:19:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Shin Cooler cannot be stopped
[2:19:38] <+Rust_Wick> yamero cooler
[2:19:39] <Mattmandx1> Jiren is just alien Saitama without the humor or charm
[2:19:40] <bushbabyomega> @dking0000 Nah, Xenoverse characters are just Gohan clones with God complexes
[2:19:44] <Saiyza> yaaAAAAHHHHH
[2:19:45] <+badchoice5> Jiren is basically all the worst parts of Super Man, he's the anti-All Might
[2:19:46] <%Kahnicus> But, in the end, Freezer, was Cooler. And Cooler, was Freezer.
[2:19:48] <Millia_Sparkle> oh higgins spamming vanish thts y his meter low lol
[2:19:52] <Idon__> I thought for sure I wasn't gonna main Jiren, but then they made him the Geese of DBFZ...
[2:19:53] <Nashingbuttons> >implying that Saitama has charm
[2:19:54] <majindusto> Cooler was also in "Plan to Eradicate the Saiyans"
[2:19:55] <MyNameIsRasus> yeyeyeye

[2:20:22] <MarylandJutsu> LEAVE JIREN TO FUGGINS
[2:20:22] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Cooler has a fan girl scream. I'm surprised no one is bringing this up
[2:20:23] <Nashingbuttons> In Dragon Ball Fusions, Celluza was a thing

[2:21:05] <majindusto> Kale was just a Female Broly
[2:21:11] <Mattmandx1> #16 still top tier despite Arcsyst's best efforts to nerf him
[2:21:13] <Millia_Sparkle> agreeed no other option is gonna be used

[2:21:16] <%ElenaManetta> Android 16's hair looks like Plague or Pat going for hair plugs.
[2:21:18] <%dking0000> Kale was better because she's something

[2:25:25] <Mattmandx1> Vegito's fight lasted less than 4 minutes in the anime so a lot of fans felt blue-balled with the previous episode hyping up his return
[2:25:30] <Nashingbuttons> @dking0000 It kind of doesn'tmatter because shenanigans, but placement wise, the story is between universe 6 and Zamasu, and 21 is essentially Cell 2.
[2:25:34] <SuperTurboSABER> WHEN YOU GO PICOLO MODE

[2:26:52] <+Rust_Wick> rip pickle dick
[2:26:54] <+badchoice5> Bardock is the biggest
[2:26:57] <%Doodle_Taco> That sweet button smash noise
[2:26:59] <%Sulliman34> bardock's LL string is just a faster 16 with better range
[2:26:59] <%dking0000> Pat using the overpowered high tiers as usual
[2:26:59] <RiceeFTW> you know Pat's seen SOME competitive DBFZ when he finishes combo with the drill LMAO
[2:27:00] <HalcyonJon> bardock is a beast in this game
[2:27:00] <Burny01> cause he's piccolo, nail, and Kami
[2:27:01] <+Irridium> been a looong time since I fought a team without bardock on it

[2:27:03] <+Yokuho> Gotenks is also S tier tho
[2:27:05] <dekkitout> piccolo is the father, son, and holy ghost

[2:27:05] <+mountainmike1> Bardock brings da UnGa
[2:27:14] <DrkJP520> 21 is not mechanical, and therefore not an android. Nice one, localization team

[2:28:58] <bushbabyomega> I still find it hard to believe that Trunks was in his 30's during Super
[2:29:01] <%Doodle_Taco> SSj2 is objectively the best
[2:29:01] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> Broly's Wife PogChamp
[2:29:01] <Mattmandx1> Frieza's "My power level is 530,000" is pretty bad too because that doesn't apply to his final form
[2:29:08] <+AlopekisPup> He used a time machine to come back from 20 years in the future.
[2:29:09] <KingKodiakVA> Rose cause God drains you faster

[2:29:26] <KiraKamixephos> Esports arena
[2:29:29] <Mattmandx1> @bushbabyomega Trunks was 28 in Super I think

[2:29:51] <$spacehouse> Trunks keeps on coming
[2:29:53] <%TehPryceIsRight> While Trunk's line is garbage, Bluegeta is literally still saying his Niagra Pummel voiceline LONG after you hit Goku Black with it.
[2:29:53] <+Yokuho> Trunks is actually the best character
[2:29:55] <Nashingbuttons> Trunks was so bad in the Zamasu arc
[2:29:58] <+Rust_Wick> trunks has big benis sword
[2:29:58] <Cobaltor_252> I think Goku's gonna win
[2:30:00] <%Doodle_Taco> But the sword tho
[2:30:05] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Trunks wears his Mom’s clothes
[2:30:08] <Nashingbuttons> I liked Trunks a lot as a kid but ugh
[2:30:08] <+GreatBrightBlack> Mai > Trunks
[2:30:09] <Dakuu75> didn't trunk's entire timeline get erased by zeno in super?
[2:30:10] <%Sulliman34> noooooo he missed it
[2:30:14] <Ion_LaserX> It took Trunks a long time to go back to the future to beat baby Cell
[2:30:16] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Trunks wanted to date a chick older than his mom
[2:30:17] <HalcyonJon> Down and A with Goku is cool.

[2:39:52] <%theslippybrit> half immortal is just a polite way of saying old
[2:39:53] <+ilasper1> ???????
[2:39:53] <nepwar> yup
[2:39:54] <%NobleJedi> that's correct....
[2:39:55] <%Nekros4442> yes that is acutally true
[2:39:55] <TheGershon> That was super accurate and precise
[2:39:55] <NumberTooBig> Zamasu is worse than Bedman, because bedman at least talks at 2X speed
[2:39:56] <dekkitout> its called a monkey's paw Kappa
[2:39:56] <derekwst3> its dragon ball what do you expect
[2:39:57] <ebonifragaria> Thaaaaat explains everything
[2:39:57] <%Skeletorexplains> Thanks fuggins
[2:39:58] <+abadbadman> tell him how they had to destroy the universe to beat him
[2:39:58] <+thewaifoo> that is correct
[2:39:58] <Ion_LaserX> What?
[2:39:59] <person181> that's so STUPID
[2:39:59] <%Remery_> aww
[2:40:00] <+badchoice5> That was very concise, well done Fuggins
[2:40:00] <honestab33> yes! fucking stupid dbz super lore
[2:40:00] <%Nekros4442> that's completely correct
[2:40:01] <Millia_Sparkle> pat just taking the summary time to try really hard
[2:40:01] <Mattmandx1> In the manga Zamasu just split into a million of himself because Trunks cut off pieces off him but each piece was immortal, no weird half purple shit in the manga
[2:40:03] <%Sulliman34> immortal also doesnt mean indestructible
[2:40:03] <%ArcanumMBD> and people think the zamasu arc is the BEST DRAGONBALL ARC
[2:40:07] <%ArcanumMBD> THEY ARE WRONG
[2:40:09] <+AngriestAngryArtist> IS there a zamasu that wishes for world peace? and he comes in to help goku?
[2:40:10] <DSD24> That was pretty good explanation Fuggins thank you!
[2:40:11] <%NWR_James> The other one isn't immortal because he took Goku's human body
[2:40:12] <SephirKath> James marsters? Dude is HOT
[2:40:15] <RiceeFTW> SENZU BEAN
[2:40:16] <bundon> That’s actually a pretty good explanation of the Goku Black Arc
[2:40:16] <suikudo> DO IT
[2:40:19] <+Jordan_z123> Hit is the best thing from super
[2:40:19] <mr_slaide> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:40:20] <+SuichiTanaka> Uncle Fugg is the best <3
[2:40:21] <%MANDRAGORAROOT> thank you fuggins :)
[2:40:21] <%NobleJedi> PLEASE
[2:40:21] <GGvonGGmcGG> I wish that they'd replace the Broly with the cool Broly from the new movie
[2:40:22] <suikudo> I LOVE AZUMANGA DIAOH
[2:40:23] <+badchoice5> Dude I would watch that stream
[2:40:24] <$spacehouse> SENZU BEAN
[2:40:25] <pectusumbra> alright, gotta get some sleep. good night and have fun all
[2:40:26] <%Typhaeon> Don't make me want to die-oh
[2:40:26] <ebonifragaria> I monotone I hope
[2:40:26] <Ion_LaserX> James Marsters is still trying to apologize for Dragonball Evolution?
[2:40:27] <%Niney_Who> Yep
[2:40:28] <KingKodiakVA> Zamasu ARC is super confusing but damn those fights are cool
[2:40:30] <%Remery_> Summarizw Love Hina
[2:40:30] <+abadbadman> Fuggin should go on Plagues DBZ channel
[2:40:30] <GGvonGGmcGG> @Jordan_z123 new Broly is the bes tthing from Super
[2:40:32] <Dame_90> BOI
[2:40:32] <suikudo> HYPE
[2:40:32] <bushbabyomega> @arcanummbd Agreed, hypocrite bleach arc is the worst arc
[2:40:33] <%JenovasPuppet> Azumanga Dioh: It's Cute
[2:40:33] <+AlopekisPup> That doesn't explain anything. How can you be "half immortal"? Isn't that just being mortal?
[2:40:34] <%MANDRAGORAROOT> galick gun is cuul
[2:40:35] <$cureneckbeard> azumanga a good cartoon
[2:40:36] <SailingSaturn> @AngriestPat summarize Bleach cirREE
[2:40:36] <%MANDRAGORAROOT> cool
[2:40:36] <%NobleJedi> I need to rewatch that show....
[2:40:36] <%ElenaManetta> Talk to me like one of your weeb friends~
[2:40:36] <%Niney_Who> He used it with Trunks against Zamasu
[2:40:37] <mr_slaide> Love Hina sucks.
[2:40:37] <CrypticMochi> Zamasu sounds so fucking dumb, thanks Fugku
[2:40:37] <ShichiNoBushi> Garlic Jr. became immortal and he survives and regenerates from everything.
[2:40:37] <TheGershon> I think the idea of Goku Black and Zamasu are cool, just not that well executed
[2:40:39] <DrkJP520> Zamasu gets infected by the G-virus
[2:40:41] <OwlLightningMage> The moves don't matter Pat
[2:40:43] <$megamonmon123> if not for dragonball evolution we wouldnt have super or the new broly
[2:40:44] <+GreatBrightBlack> Spike was the only good thing about Buffy
[2:40:45] <%goose_attack_almanac> Nobody forgets their moves unless they're Tien.
[2:40:45] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Fuggins sounds so sad rn I will give you my energy to defeat the evil lord podrick
[2:40:48] <DefaultSettiings> we faulting the lore over this? an old man with several warrants of sexual defiance lives on an island with a talking turtle
[2:40:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 28?!?! JESUS
[2:40:49] <+Destructive_Forces> Dragon Ball is so fucking stupid, it's the best
[2:40:49] <%MANDRAGORAROOT> yeah you are
[2:40:49] <$KnivesEve> cooking is so fun, cooking is so fun
[2:40:49] <%JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> it's just girls doing girl things. what's so complicated about azumanga daioh
[2:40:49] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat have Fuggins explain more animes
[2:40:53] <%Solidnick18> LUL
[2:40:55] <DSD24> Masanko!
[2:40:55] <+Dreday543> lol
[2:40:55] <%dking0000> Galick Gun is cooler than big bang and I will die on that hill
[2:40:58] <+badchoice5> Hey look it's Adult Krillin!
[2:40:59] <Mattmandx1> Vegeta used Big Bang attack to try to kill Broly in the new movie
[2:40:59] <+VektorTroika> eli FETISHIZES tien
[2:41:01] <OwlLightningMage> Vegeta just randomy chooses his moves based on whatever LUL
[2:41:01] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Has someone uploaded Plague's Time Travel is Stupid. It's the only one I got to watch once
[2:41:03] <$cureneckbeard> azumanga deep lore
[2:41:04] <%Sulliman34> maybe its cause hes bald
[2:41:04] <suikudo> cooking is so fun cooking is so fun now its time to take a break and see what we have done
[2:41:04] <Ion_LaserX> Spike was the only good thing about the last season of Angel
[2:41:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[2:41:09] <zecht89> @suikudo because only one of the fused zamasu's zamasu is actually immortal
[2:41:09] <%Niney_Who> SHIIET
[2:41:11] <Goldenwolf98> People actually taking any Dragonball story seriously LUL
[2:41:11] <+abadbadman> they both have 3 eyes
[2:41:17] <%MANDRAGORAROOT> oh no
[2:41:19] <%theslippybrit> spike was the only good thing about buffy
[2:41:19] <honestab33> azumanga is great, exept for the straight up pedo teacher
[2:41:21] <%JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> tsukurimasho tsukurimasho
[2:41:23] <GGvonGGmcGG> Tien gets turned into a complete bitch in every arc, but especially Tournament of Power arc
[2:41:23] <OwlLightningMage> Tien is the hardest worker in the series and gets nothing for it. It's poetic really LUL
[2:41:23] <%ThatGuyfromMars> can fuggins explain evangelion for me
[2:41:24] <CrypticMochi> Fugku will beat the evil Patdocking
[2:41:24] <$megamonmon123> it sucks that vegeta doesnt come up with new moves anymore

[2:41:30] <Mr_Strut> Pat, YOU'RE bald
[2:41:33] <suikudo> @zecht89 But what does it mean to be half immortal!?
[2:41:33] <Triplicat> YEAAAAH
[2:41:35] <TheGershon> Love the multiple hits on that one
[2:41:36] <+McSoliace> Tien works so hard to get shit on by toriyama
[2:41:37] <%ArcanumMBD> @KingKodiakVA The fights are awful because Goku and Vegeta get bitch slapped out of SSB like 5 times and then just stand up and go back into it and keep fighting despite people going "they have NO ENERGY LEFT" Same thing happens in ToP arc, and it is also trash
[2:41:37] <DSD24> I love Neo Tri Beam
[2:41:38] <$megamonmon123> @theslippybrit you mean he attempted rapist?
[2:41:39] <%Prism_Wing> Enter Chie?
[2:41:41] <$spacehouse> TIEN was the last time DB Villains were weirdos
[2:41:43] <+badchoice5> "What?" is the correct sentiment in that situation

[2:43:05] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Fat Buu loses weight in Super
[2:43:05] <%ElenaManetta> He's just you without a beard
[2:43:06] <%Doodle_Taco> Jiren more like Jiren't
[2:43:07] <Ion_LaserX> Fat Buu is real stupid
[2:43:07] <%Typhaeon> We need a Pat Buu mod

[2:43:30] <DSD24> Remember when Majin Buu saw a porno mag and made a wife because he was lonely?
[2:43:30] <suikudo> I have learned less than nothing
[2:43:33] <GGvonGGmcGG> Fat Buu was kept out of the Tournament of Power arc, probably because he has a bunch of stupid techniques that would've cheesed the entire tournament
[2:43:34] <Millia_Sparkle> come back from the losers bracket
[2:43:35] <+GreatBrightBlack> all the goros
[2:43:35] <%Solidnick18> because
[2:43:35] <zecht89> @suikudo it corrupts the body, making it heal the damage and deform, essentially not being truly immortal

[2:44:58] <bushbabyomega> I mean, Goku will hit the roof eventually where even Gods don't make a challenge for him. Maybe he'll get reincarnated in a similar way to Kid Buu to keep the fighting spirit going?

[2:45:37] <ArtThouBored> Yes
[2:45:41] <+Destructive_Forces> Broly is so fucking good since the buffs.
[2:45:41] <TheGershon> The Frost Giants
[2:45:42] <%Remery_> Cloaca?
[2:45:42] <%ElenaManetta> Oh so like Paige
[2:45:42] <+alexth3gr3at> PC
[2:45:43] <%MelBrooksKA> @ebonifragaria God Approves of Straight Fuggins
[2:45:44] <derekwst3> Frieza does have a child
[2:45:44] <Gutsandlove> Unlikely
[2:45:45] <+OceanGovernor> Man when is new Broly getting in here
[2:45:46] <person181> they have NO LORE
[2:45:46] <%AlopekisPup> Doesn't mean they can't have sexy times.
[2:45:48] <%Skeletorexplains> Frieza had parents, he & his father were just very Posh
[2:45:48] <$spacehouse> All times are sexy times
[2:45:49] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @HyraFukit I am sorry, but it is the truth
[2:45:49] <Millia_Sparkle> ouch
[2:45:50] <ShichiNoBushi> Aren't Frieza-race asexual?
[2:45:52] <honestab33> shoto is like Ryu Ken akuma ect
[2:45:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> they lay eggs in the fridge
[2:45:54] <DSD24> I know Android 21 uses her tail in that Plague art he did one time
[2:45:54] <Mattmandx1> Frieza is supposedly a clone/ asexual offspring of King Cold
[2:45:54] <bushbabyomega> @cerberusdriver Whichever one has friends to play with
[2:45:56] <nepwar> they take off their skin to show their true naked selves
[2:45:56] <%CerberusDriver> PC doesnt have PS4 buttons though
[2:45:59] <SailingSaturn> They Puke eggs from their mouths cirHuh

[2:46:03] <ArtThouBored> I've seen some hot Cooler stuff wth it
[2:46:03] <dekkitout> theres some line about them being mutants in xenoverse for whatever reason
[2:46:04] <Millia_Sparkle> funny grab
[2:46:08] <%dking0000> How will new Broly even play? Like what could he do different than current Broly?

[2:46:14] <+phatmac16> Where is frezias dick?
[2:46:15] <%JenovasPuppet> According to the fanart I've seen, Freiza race is VERY sexual
[2:46:15] <%HyraFukit> @ThatGuyfromMars How can you say something so brave yet so controversial?
[2:46:19] <+dynanite> Didn't King Cold genocide the rest of their race?
[2:46:19] <$cureneckbeard> Frieza-race reproduced by stuffing their cloaca with all seven dragonballs
[2:46:21] <derekwst3> buu can create kids aswell
[2:46:23] <markdreizehn> With Broly being Canon now and Frieza learning about Fusion, do you think they're gonna make Cooler canon now to so Cooler and Frieza can fuse into Refrigerator?
[2:46:24] <$megamonmon123> i cant wait for good broly to be in this game
[2:46:25] <%Remery_> I like Buus poofy pant :)
[2:46:31] <%AlopekisPup> Why is he green? Is he sick Buu?

[2:47:11] <%HyraFukit> Reverse sweep? nvm

[3:07:56] <%MANDRAGORAROOT> monkaS

[3:08:04] <ScreamingMeat> Lately I've been playing very little Warframe and just log in for the dailies until I get the Zenith
[3:08:08] <%ECRead> @samuraijoe_ that is the Qanba Obsidian
[3:08:09] <%BlancoRico> It's an Online Multiplayer
[3:08:10] <%Everpresent_Overseer> yes
[3:08:11] <ebonifragaria> If you can't dance naked on top of a mailbox, it's not an MMO
[3:08:11] <Huntercd> Mesa Prime's ass is fantastic
[3:08:14] <+Nomicro4u> Just enjoy warframe through SFM
[3:08:16] <RiceeFTW> @dekkitout the spy missions on pluto are ezpz and gives tons of exp tho
[3:08:16] <%theslippybrit> damn, animal crossing changed
[3:08:17] <faegbeard> Warframe is an MMO in the same way DBZ Fighters is an MMO
[3:08:25] <%ElenaManetta> Fuggins doesn't want to fuck you so fortunately he doesn't have to listen to you babble on about Warframe. Unlike poor Paige.

[3:09:45] <nina9669> ivaras easy to get
[3:09:45] <%Buttface_> don't buy Ivara, spy missions have a ton of good rewards
[3:09:47] <RiceeFTW> @3xgilly nope,
[3:09:47] <+SuichiTanaka> Ivara can be farmed with stealth frames pretty easily. It takes time, but it's not very taxing.
[3:09:48] <ArtThouBored> Play MKTrilogy
[3:09:50] <OwlLightningMage> Limbo is just Dio

[3:10:17] <%GarbageNirvana> Idk if I have the plat to buy it off of people
[3:10:18] <%ECRead> go to gate
[3:10:21] <+AppleBandito> You might also need to change some of your settings in terms of the types of matches you're looking for.
[3:10:22] <%HRDSalami654> They are looking at possibly transferring gear between platforms in Warframe in the future.
[3:10:24] <Worldbrand> @GarbageNirvana primed frames generally sell for even less than their counterparts in DE's market
[3:10:30] <SumKnowBuddy> on a scale of suck to fuck, how bad are you at this game?

[3:23:56] <hitorio> Losses are just the game bukakke-ing you with information on how to win.
[3:23:59] <%GohanEgret> I want someone to beat Pat and then just leave after the 1st game, take them points and run
[3:24:00] <+hazzy_o7> 17 the true hero

[3:32:08] <%HyraFukit> @AngriestPat Losing after 30 so wins is a fine way to remember you are human
[3:32:12] <Asian5Caillou> The true lore is that AH is better fighting games than ole fuck boivin here
[3:32:12] <donkymagooterson> the humiliation of defeat humbles Pat
[3:32:12] <%Doodle_Taco> This is it for me, see you later my dudes
[3:32:17] <+AppleBandito> These connections are looking super chunky.

[3:32:32] <%AncelDeLambert> Are you okay, Annie?
[3:32:39] <+Nomicro4u> rude
[3:32:41] <Nashingbuttons> The other people don't get paid to play video games, so who is really the winner here?
[3:32:42] <+Wool> What console? BibleThump
[3:32:45] <$cureneckbeard> I get it
[3:32:45] <%SergeEXE> JP7 intentionally using bottom tier characters

[3:32:58] <person181> k-marts are still a thing?
[3:33:05] <%Skeletorexplains> Fuggins, when two fuggins love each other very much they make a smaller fuggins
[3:33:06] <DonatelloJose> Kmart isn’t a thing anymore
[3:33:08] <HeavyC4> 16 frame data sucks
[3:33:10] <KasGiD> But Krillin can pop off a senzu bean
[3:33:11] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> baby come from buttholes
[3:33:13] <%ElenaManetta> That's like, 99% of the problems with online mode in fighting games. It's often just pros kicking in people's shit.
[3:33:14] <HeavyC4> his hit box is good tho
[3:33:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> wooooooow
[3:33:15] <TheFluff12> Hi Pat Hi Fuggins Bye Pat Bye Fuggins

[3:33:55] <donkymagooterson> oh dear
[3:33:56] <nepwar> yeyeyeye
[3:33:57] <KasGiD> Heheh you're an idiot
[3:33:57] <+attackofthesage> @ElenaManetta That's why ranked exists. The real problem is when ranked doesn't work or the netcode is hot garbage
[3:33:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> fuck tien
[3:33:59] <Run44forrest> krillin players either do autocombo or are godlike theres no inbetween
[3:34:02] <+badchoice5> Could Krillin beat Cooler at Krillin's max power?
[3:34:03] <%mostundesired> Tien, maybe Roshi
[3:34:03] <%MANDRAGORAROOT> tien shin han
[3:34:04] <%RaikenTB> Nah Tien is the strongest human.
[3:34:04] <xBolts4Lifex> Tien is stronger
[3:34:05] <+SuichiTanaka> Tien.
[3:34:05] <person181> T I E N
[3:34:06] <KasGiD> Sure as hell not Tien
[3:34:07] <spire6> Tien
[3:34:08] <%AncelDeLambert> Krillin petering out fucking SUCKS
[3:34:09] <%Skeletorexplains> "Who else" Silence..
[3:34:09] <%SergeEXE> RAW DASH
[3:34:09] <$cureneckbeard> TN
[3:34:10] <%BestTeaMaker> imagine losing to krillen Kappa
[3:34:10] <$megamonmon123> yamcha
[3:34:11] <KasGiD> Dude is a god damn jobber
[3:34:15] <+VektorTroika> Yamcha
[3:34:15] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Tien. Human. With 3 eyes
[3:34:15] <+Emperor_Bad> hes gokus best buddy it makes perfect sense
[3:34:16] <StarkMaximum> @cureneckbeard I love that this implies that Elmo is a god of destruction, imagining Elmo with Beerus' voice is some kind of something
[3:34:17] <+SmilingBoi> Krillin is also the shortest human
[3:34:17] <+Matto424> yamcha if baseball is involved
[3:34:18] <+ItsAGundamu> Broly has the biggest number
[3:34:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> kitty
[3:34:25] <%GohanEgret> apatWink
[3:34:27] <$megamonmon123> krillin only sucks in relation to saiyans to be perfectly honest
[3:34:31] <KasGiD> Literally suicides himself with his clones in the tournament of power arc
[3:34:31] <Mattmandx1> Krillen was weak as shit in Super before the ToP so the strongest human title goes to someone else now
[3:34:32] <TheGershon> Would have been Tien before Super was a thing
[3:34:33] <dekkitout> tajRS
[3:34:42] <%AncelDeLambert> Krillin is the strongest Human
[3:34:44] <+ChestMimik> Are we all just ignoring the strength of one MISTER HERCULE SATAN? A man too POWERFUL to be added to this roster?
[3:34:46] <$megamonmon123> krillin os a beast when compared to other humans
[3:34:46] <%AncelDeLambert> he's the STRONGEST
[3:34:51] <%ElenaManetta> @attackofthesage But there's also times where better players will purposely wipe their online saves or use diff accounts so they start back at rank 1 and beat the shit out of easy players again. It happened a lot in Pokken.
[3:34:54] <%NovaKnightmare> remember when Krillin beat up that guy at the tournie before buu saga
[3:34:55] <+runegod20> the humans in dragon ball is like Dan in street fighter, he's good, but there's just so many people that invalidate them
[3:34:57] <Run44forrest> shaggy blanco when
[3:34:58] <%RaikenTB> @ChestMimik His daughter is stronger than him.
[3:35:00] <StarkMaximum> more like majin blue. this joke isn't funny that's purple
[3:35:03] <%AncelDeLambert> what the fuck is Tien, anyways?
[3:35:03] <%Keyd00d> same
[3:35:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yea
[3:35:09] <$megamonmon123> @runegod20 exactly
[3:35:09] <HeavyC4> @ChestMimik general tao kill satan master thus satan martial arts potential was crippled.
[3:35:12] <Nashingbuttons> You all are forgetting Farmer with Shotgun.
[3:35:12] <%rdark_ksu> and turn anything into food you want
[3:35:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> What are the animal things in the Dragon Ball world? Like the President Dog. They sure as fuck aren't human
[3:35:19] <katocrimson> who is the stronger 1/2 human? gohan or trunks?
[3:35:20] <+attackofthesage> @ElenaManetta True. Those are called smurfs and that's a thing in any game with online
[3:35:21] <+VektorTroika> that's the ideal mindset for a buu
[3:35:22] <$megamonmon123> tien is human bu achieved enlightenment or something
[3:35:25] <dekkitout> tien is a massive disappointment
[3:35:25] <%TheStarbecue> comeback?
[3:35:29] <%GohanEgret> @katocrimson gohan
[3:35:31] <$megamonmon123> gohan is stronger than trunks
[3:35:33] <%CaptainPileDriver> ded
[3:35:35] <%Dr_DangerPhD> You guys are forgetting the defender of earth, the man who killed cell single handedly, MR. SATAN
[3:35:35] <Doc1790> Ah dang I don't hav the password
[3:35:35] <%Agami23> remember, buu has kids inside of xenoverse
[3:35:36] <%BestTeaMaker> comeback PogChamp
[3:35:37] <+phatmac16> And live with mr satan
[3:35:38] <Run44forrest> pat block low
[3:35:39] <HeavyC4> @megamonmon123 tien has alien heretige
[3:35:41] <$spacehouse> Broly power MAXIMUM
[3:35:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> bye
[3:35:45] <+TheMostMediocreGamer> don't disrespect king cat like that
[3:35:48] <+runegod20> being able to shoot fire balls would make you a super hero, but everyone in the universe has a minimum of 2 projectiles each
[3:35:48] <%ElenaManetta> Why smurfs apatWhat ?
[3:35:48] <Asian5Caillou> Krillin one of the best techniques. If Goku took and developed that it would be insane
[3:35:49] <KasGiD> Tien is a guy who is SUPPOSED to be stronger than Roshi but now is weaker than everyone.
[3:35:49] <The_Butterfly_Man> @Doc1790 1112
[3:35:50] <$megamonmon123> @heavyc4 says who?

[3:35:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> KRILLINS RISE UP
[3:35:53] <braincraft> He intentionally used the lowest-tier characters.
[3:35:54] <NumberTooBig> hey @AngriestPat , unrelated, but you think its better to hook up a 50 ft ethernet cord around my house or continue using 5g wifi through 3 walls.
[3:35:54] <+TheHeroAppears> the canon ending when krillan beats broly

[3:40:35] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> jiren seems really weak
[3:40:38] <Nashingbuttons> If Jiren is so strong, why doesn't he have GOUGI?
[3:40:41] <%GohanEgret> the mixup is no mixup
[3:40:44] <Asian5Caillou> Broly could have beat everybody in the tournament of power by himself
[3:40:47] <hntronium> IMPOSIBLE
[3:40:52] <%Keyd00d> but... it came out a year ago
[3:40:55] <HeavyC4> @DesuDesuDokiDoki LUL Dude check out twitter. 50% damage anywhere no bar.
[3:41:00] <The_Butterfly_Man> time traveler
[3:41:06] <braincraft> At Broly's, you can have it your way.
[3:41:07] <%AncelDeLambert> isn't it one year next month?
[3:41:11] <Vashido22> Jiren has great damage and neutral
[3:41:11] <%ThatGuyfromMars> fuggins played it in the time chamber

[3:41:15] <%TheStarbecue> SPeND THAT METER SON
[3:41:15] <%Spydurman> you guys need to beat Pat so bad he never comes back Jebaited
[3:41:15] <+AppleBandito> Jiren actually has some good tools for the neutral game, but he just came out.
[3:41:16] <albinobigfoot1> If jiren is so strong, why hasnt he beat dark souls yet? check-mate

[3:43:03] <%bluetocho13> you killed 2 of there guys
[3:43:03] <%HyraFukit> The easiest way to get good is to get bodied after all
[3:43:04] <braincraft> That's a vital skill.
[3:43:05] <StarkMaximum> guys stop making pat sad!!!

[3:43:19] <+HalfShellHero96> From it seems jiren can be a pretty good mid or anchor I really like his assist
[3:43:20] <WeedSpagon> Is Pat, Goku?

[3:55:05] <%TempestaDePrimo> So Pat
[3:55:09] <$TheNeedlesD> Cell Dorado
[3:55:11] <leinadtonu> Emlo looks like the dumpster
[3:55:12] <Run44forrest> cell?
[3:55:18] <ventus_fury> I wonder if Pat saw the new movie
[3:55:19] <dekkitout> how did vegeta go god again?
[3:55:20] <%theslippybrit> fuggins turned up to thanksgiving with humid white goo all over him
[3:55:20] <atomicjo345> Sup
[3:55:21] <%Demon_Shadow4> cell is a cluster fuck!
[3:55:21] <%ThePuddingDead> Super Cellan God Super Cellan?
[3:55:23] <+Nomicro4u> Elmo gets his Sass from Paige and his bag from Pat
[3:55:24] <Mattmandx1> Cell would go Super Perfect God Super Perfect
[3:55:25] <%JJCheeker> Elmo is the couch
[3:55:25] <The_Butterfly_Man> well how much S cells does he have
[3:55:25] <KasGiD> Cell is 10.74% Goku
[3:55:26] <%ElenaManetta> Mystery Science Theater Stream with Fuggins and Pat watching DBZ.
[3:55:27] <%NobleJedi> or Golden Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan
[3:55:30] <%SvenHolgersson> When he comes back hes Super Cell basically
[3:55:31] <derekwst3> i think he can go golden
[3:55:34] <Run44forrest> did they mean broly
[3:55:40] <%Fenrirlives> Cell would have to gain the support of every human on earth first so naaaaah
[3:55:41] <Dakuu75> would cell turn gold-freeza or ss-blue if he tried?
[3:55:43] <SephirKath> Cell does have the zenkai ability
[3:55:43] <BadgerDK> he has no hair to turn blur though

[3:56:28] <%ElenaManetta> Pat and Fuggins talking about Paige off-screen but we'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SEE HER is as frustrating as never seeing the parents in Cow and Chicken

[4:02:57] <foreverN2dust> Bathtub is a strong option for drunk after party sleeping. Shower if you puke and you can lock the door so people don't fuck with you.

[4:14:02] <+megamanx74> ...yeah
[4:14:04] <%3xgilly> He';s trying to negate blue life WOAH
[4:14:05] <braincraft> You can only do it if your opponent doesn't do anything about it.
[4:14:06] <+Sephorai> @angriestpat hey I’m pink square and super Saiyan blue rannk, will you fight me so I can eat your ass?

[4:14:14] <Mattmandx1> @AngriestPat Snapping you out like that gets rid of your blue health
[4:14:16] <%theslippybrit> just keep lining em up and lining em up, and she'll keep knocking em down and knocking em down
[4:14:16] <KiraKamixephos> the point is that he knows you won’t stop it
[4:14:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat snapping makes you lose any recoverable health you would have like marvel
[4:14:28] <Run44forrest> pat has no more ass
[4:14:30] <Millia_Sparkle> gg lmfaio
[4:14:32] <%ElenaManetta> Everyone's been using 18 so far. Everyone but Pat.
[4:14:41] <%Demon_Shadow4> TALK SHIIT GET hHIT!
[4:14:44] <braincraft> No one chains that many snapbacks in a real match because people who know how to play just tech out or vanish or use a special or level 3 or just jab you out.
[4:14:47] <%SvenHolgersson> All blue health go buhbye
[4:14:54] <Bennett_Fracture> you live and you learn pat...
[4:14:56] <ventus_fury> She's okay i guess
[4:14:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat pat doesn't like em 18
[4:15:01] <%Toynota10> How you liking the DLC?
[4:15:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 18 is prime waifu
[4:15:02] <person181> she is a top tier wifu
[4:15:07] <dekkitout> but 18 isnt big, maybe if there was a super 18 -OH MY GOD I JUST GAVE MYSELF AN ERECTION!- ResidentSleeper
[4:15:12] <WeedSpagon> 18 is a married woman
[4:15:12] <Run44forrest> i havent seen 1 block cancel
[4:15:13] <%ThePuddingDead> i think 18 was one of the chars besides teen gohan on my team, but that was months ago
[4:15:14] <The_Butterfly_Man> was 18 buffed a bit ago or are people just using her more
[4:15:16] <%RaikenTB> Krillin WutFace
[4:15:16] <%TheShal> HUMAN TEAM
[4:15:19] <sdgundum990> I just got home from D&D. Who's the special guest?
[4:15:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat apatDab apatDab apatDab
[4:15:21] <+Inchoates> Also you are in a disadvantageous position when they snap you since they have frame advantage to set up while you enter the stage
[4:15:23] <suikudo> no randy! no!
[4:15:24] <%TheStarbecue> HOOMAN
[4:15:24] <+AccioSkullar> videl PogChamp
[4:15:25] <ShichiNoBushi> Remember that time that Pat said that 18 was a good number and Paige said she liked 16?
[4:15:28] <Dakuu75> team-human, lol
[4:15:29] <%SvenHolgersson> I mean 11 isn;t in the game yet sooooooo
[4:15:40] <%TheStarbecue> table have turned hoomans
[4:15:42] <%TehPryceIsRight> Damn it's real hard to get into this room
[4:15:44] <%theslippybrit> no wonder he isnt streaming fan fest, pat is getting fucked to sleep
[4:15:46] <%Toynota10> @sdgundum990 PAt's college buddy Fuggins. He's shown up a few times
[4:15:47] <braincraft> It's not that 18 changed so much that for a while the meta favored people who could pressure you in the corner.
[4:15:47] <%AdmiralButtloaf> Team apatBig vs Team HOOMAN
[4:15:52] <+Inchoates> Hence the disgusting Hellzone Grenade set ups
[4:15:55] <Idon__> Pat...
[4:15:55] <%ElenaManetta> Trusting chat over google
[4:15:55] <+AccioSkullar> guard cancel you mean

[4:15:59] <NumberTooBig> a krillen online is a scary thing

[4:16:25] <NumberTooBig> dont show him mercy because he's taller than Pat
[4:16:26] <+KaiserCrimson_1> The switching characters during a block right?
[4:16:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> KRILLIN IS OP
[4:16:43] <braincraft> 18's assist calls are similar to Piccolo and Gotenks' level 1s that meaty cover the corner while you're snapped in.
[4:16:43] <%Keyd00d> god dayum krillin
[4:16:43] <Idon__> mess with the krillin. you get the killin

[4:17:27] <%JJCheeker> ffffff
[4:17:27] <ShichiNoBushi> Videl ruins Gohan's secret identity by calling out his name instead of Sayaman's.

[4:17:55] <sdgundum990> So Videl has the dedicated Great Saiyaman button? Does she also have a saiyagirl skin?

[4:18:00] <dsauce999> RAW SUPES SQUAD where you at?
[4:18:06] <Dakuu75> @broly_bear your killen me smalls XD
[4:18:07] <Idon__> Saiyaman is an enigma
[4:18:11] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat you have a tendency to just stop doing combos/blocking and stand there, like, i understand blocking but you kinda just stand there and get hit
[4:18:11] <+AccioSkullar> Pog
[4:18:13] <%ElenaManetta> SWEATING
[4:18:14] <dekkitout> what no, great saiyaman is a paragon of the people, not that dweeb gohan
[4:18:17] <%TheStarbecue> the great saiyaman is two saibamen on eachothers shoulders
[4:18:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> he going easy?

[4:18:24] <zaptar13> What's a Gohan?
[4:18:26] <KiraKamixephos> Uncle
[4:18:35] <%AncelDeLambert> Videl's got a good SNK King kick
[4:18:38] <Idon__> Don't know what a Gohan is, but it sounds very disappointing.
[4:18:39] <%Keyd00d> Still waiting on Grandpa Gohan dlc
[4:18:41] <flattopswag> Raw level 3 while their flying towards you

[4:18:59] <person181> great saiyaman is both the hero we need and deserve, give this true hero a slot
[4:19:04] <ShichiNoBushi> Yes. Grandpa Gohan, please. Or maybe Roshi.
[4:19:10] <ventus_fury> Password for a ring room? Hm...
[4:19:12] <+broly_bear> is Gohan the biggest dissapointment in anime? LUL

[4:19:35] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 1212
[4:19:41] <%ElenaManetta> HydrationBot has reminded Pat twice to take a drink and I don't think I've seen him drink ONCE on stream in 4 hours. He probably should with how much he's sweating over these matches.
[4:19:42] <ventus_fury> ah i was gonna guess it til i got in lol

[4:21:18] <majindusto> I'd be ok with GT Pan as DLC
[4:21:19] <ShichiNoBushi> Who hasn't figured out that Videl's name is an anagram of "devil"?

[4:21:35] <%RaikenTB> Did you see that remake 2 went free to play?
[4:21:38] <%mostundesired> I love Black Prior. Also reforged my love for Peacekeeper. Wish I could actually combo with her, though.
[4:21:41] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat beats both highs lows and super
[4:21:42] <okEmil> @AngriestPat Hey Pat thx for the Match, btw a bunch of people are waiting outside of the ring maybe consider going for just one round

[4:21:56] <%ThePuddingDead> @NumberTooBig .....What does that mean....? Im listening...
[4:21:56] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat Line-Kill Spirits weekend, you coward
[4:21:57] <Dakuu75> For honor is one of those games that peaked really hard then went ALL down hill in popularity it looks like
[4:22:00] <Run44forrest> reflect, 5H is OP
[4:22:10] <KiraKamixephos> I mean if they expect it yes
[4:22:19] <Worldbrand> No? But Pat has a free bathtub, I'm sure

[4:22:39] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat forget tht and just focus on reliable ones. dnt need flashy stuff
[4:22:40] <+ilasper1> big girth combos
[4:22:41] <%ElenaManetta> It's not the length of your combo that matters but the girth.
[4:22:42] <Mattmandx1> That's the curse of an all big boy team
[4:22:42] <+broly_bear> Whis should be a DLC character
[4:22:42] <%shivhappy22> thanks stridentsong apatJpeg
[4:22:42] <Captain_Aham> Do combo pa
[4:22:42] <+KaiserCrimson_1> LUL
[4:22:43] <+AngriestAngryArtist> in this game long combos means ur optimizing :P
[4:22:43] <NumberTooBig> @ThePuddingDead there was a past for honor stream that dsecribed it, but basically everyone is broken.
[4:22:45] <dekkitout> "thats right, monkey"
[4:22:45] <Run44forrest> pat did you get any practice in at all?
[4:22:48] <%TheShal> It's not the length of the combos, it's the motion of the stick
[4:22:48] <KiraKamixephos> Time to lab
[4:22:51] <+ShinHadokenman> UGLY VIDEL
[4:22:54] <%Fluxraw> THE TRUE ViDEL

[4:24:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> ded
[4:24:49] <KasGiD> Why is Videl calling The Great Saiyman, Gohan? lytUMMA
[4:24:59] <braincraft> Videl's level 1 counter powers up her Saiyaman call moves for the match.
[4:25:00] <%3xgilly> oooooohhhhhhh
[4:25:00] <alwayspronking> Nonono, its a "Canadian combo"
[4:25:01] <Mattmandx1> @Ventuss She has two level ones, her counter is the alternate
[4:25:05] <Bluewind098> The multiple concussions from being in these fights
[4:25:06] <braincraft> It's just a little damage.
[4:25:12] <person181> she's not strong enough to fight herself
[4:25:13] <Run44forrest> Fuggin coach pat
[4:25:15] <+AccioSkullar> "now this is a worthy challenge" cooler says to the human 16yo
[4:25:19] <Nashingbuttons> I know, right? The Great Saiyaman is clearly Jackie Chun.
[4:25:19] <ventus_fury> Not the dick!
[4:25:20] <Worldbrand> Oh shit, time for dick honkos
[4:25:22] <braincraft> The worst part is that you don't get the cutscene if you use the move again.
[4:25:24] <%ThePuddingDead> OOooh is that a promise?
[4:25:25] <mercado94> Fuggins tell Pat that he sucks

[4:26:14] <Sofa_King_Hype> The Big Ghetto Star ain't nobody's fool!
[4:26:17] <dsauce999> apatDICKDUNK
[4:26:17] <%theslippybrit> dunk the dick! dunk the dick! dunk the dick!
[4:26:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat reflect is a strong weapon
[4:26:17] <%Toynota10> Pat did the mouth thing again
[4:26:18] <%ElenaManetta> Pour water all over it so people think he pissed himself even though we're watching you do it
[4:26:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat succs
[4:26:22] <%Cogito1001> @Dakuu75 massive dohoonkabhankoloos.
[4:26:26] <gottigotbundles> East Canada lobby 4
[4:26:26] <TheShadowWolfen> how does one dunk dick?
[4:26:27] <%terribleusername> dick dunk is this generation's digdug
[4:26:28] <majindusto> MARK SATAN FTW
[4:26:39] <%NKOrange> yas gotta get out of that corner Pat apatSmug
[4:26:40] <Dakuu75> lmao <3 I'm so glad i'm not the only one here that saw that XD
[4:26:42] <+AccioSkullar> or vanish
[4:26:45] <Run44forrest> you can jab out beerus when he does auto combo
[4:26:47] <majindusto> People's Champ
[4:26:52] <%ElenaManetta> Fuggins can also pour water on the couch and tell Paige that Pat pissed it and get him in trouble.
[4:26:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat you can reflect level 3's with it so yeah
[4:27:01] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat 18 here. if its our turn again ill explain sorta. no timing really required
[4:27:05] <%Toynota10> Did Pat try Jiren? Did he like him?
[4:27:13] <%Gatzarlok> Pat can't even beat up a girl... How sad.
[4:27:14] <Nashingbuttons> He seems to
[4:27:15] <person181> he did
[4:27:15] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat you can
[4:27:17] <+alexth3gr3at> He did try him
[4:27:18] <Run44forrest> you can
[4:27:19] <ventus_fury> I dont think he has him?
[4:27:21] <bananrrr> but it's true
[4:27:23] <ventus_fury> Or does he?
[4:27:23] <mercado94> wat
[4:27:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat only if it's raw though
[4:27:27] <V1irtuousrabbit> It's a get off me tool the best strat is use it on wake up because its frame 1
[4:27:32] <Run44forrest> and you get big bar for reflecting
[4:27:33] <Mattmandx1> It's like a pushblock but can't be used if already blocking. So a shitty pushblock but better than nothing
[4:27:37] <majindusto> HE LOVES JIREN
[4:27:40] <+KaiserCrimson_1> You can reflect everything but grabs tbh
[4:27:41] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat frame 1. reflects everything. you can even mash without timing tbh. beats high and low mixups and loses only grabs and patience.
[4:27:44] <Midnight188> team big body seems to be failing here
[4:27:46] <%ElenaManetta> Is Pat's favorite drink Red Bull because it's yellow like the urine he craves?
[4:27:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat damn
[4:27:59] <%NWR_James> DESTROY HIM
[4:28:00] <TheShadowWolfen> i need to know, how does one go about dubking dick(s)
[4:28:07] <%theslippybrit> he doesnt crave it, he needs it to survive
[4:28:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wooooow
[4:28:09] <%Fluxraw> u pick all the big guys, but u didnt pick shaggy, why pat
[4:28:11] <%TheShal> Maybe using a team of 3 grapplers isn't the best idea.
[4:28:11] <V1irtuousrabbit> @angriestpat just use it like a pushblock
[4:28:16] <Idon__> dragon rush
[4:28:17] <%TheStarbecue> i played like ass, thank you for the games
[4:28:20] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat strong tool coming from guilty gear its pretty frustrating. cause ppl smart lol
[4:28:20] <Idon__> baits
[4:28:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat start up
[4:28:20] <+ilasper1> you get baited and get fucked
[4:28:24] <Captain_Aham> cause it can be heavily punished
[4:28:24] <bananrrr> it can be baited or thrown @AngriestPat
[4:28:25] <V1irtuousrabbit> It has a whiff
[4:28:26] <CoryFTWs> yamcha is secret god tier in like every dbz fighting game
[4:28:26] <umm_idunno> you can bait it out and wiff punish
[4:28:27] <Run44forrest> all your opponents are reflecting
[4:28:29] <+Xombor> Because then they know you're gonna do it every time and wait it out
[4:28:30] <+KaiserCrimson_1> Because if people read it you get fucked lol
[4:28:31] <%wujak> it has recovery, so if you reflect and they do nothing you get blown up for it
[4:28:31] <+paladinstarbuster> exactly
[4:28:32] <%RaikenTB> NotLikeThis
[4:28:34] <%Cogito1001> Grab a brush put a little make up
[4:28:36] <ventus_fury> woolie tutorial time
[4:28:37] <DeanX27> Dad time
[4:28:37] <Idon__> grab level 3s
[4:28:38] <majindusto> Yamcha confirmed stronger than Broly
[4:28:42] <Mattmandx1> Reflect has recovery frames
[4:28:43] <+AccioSkullar> A21 Kreygasm
[4:28:44] <%ElenaManetta> CAN YOU please PICK A NEW STAGE
[4:28:45] <N7squirrel> reflect is highly punishable
[4:28:50] <TheShadowWolfen> push the win button?
[4:28:50] <%Keyd00d> LUL
[4:28:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat basically if you whiff a reflect you get fucked, but it's like a parry, if you time it right it's amazing
[4:28:54] <Run44forrest> woolie how to play DBFZ PogChamp
[4:28:55] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat i do overhead to keep ppl down. if theyre mashing reflect ill start thinking but its hard. youl see and i wont teabag.
[4:28:55] <%ElenaManetta> FUCK!!!!
[4:28:56] <KiraKamixephos> it’s a GET OFF ME button
[4:28:58] <DeanX27> @majindusto I mean, if you played Attack of the Saiyans that's already canon Kappa
[4:28:58] <mercado94> I don't know what you or chat are talking about so do the punch thing
[4:29:00] <%theslippybrit> maybe we should find a game thats more suited to your skill level
[4:29:03] <%ElenaManetta> This FUCKING city
[4:29:04] <spooksy> if they do nothing and you reflect they get big punish
[4:29:07] <%theslippybrit> how about undertale
[4:29:11] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat if you need help dunking gokus, theres a ToD combo video by Lythero

[4:29:22] <fairore> yasss pat
[4:29:25] <KasGiD> Nice spark
[4:29:26] <Idon__> Also, should probably learn to do assist combos
[4:29:29] <%ThePuddingDead> big choke on that dudes end
[4:29:33] <Dakuu75> DAMN a early as fuck spark
[4:29:33] <%Toynota10> THis game's so fucking awesome
[4:29:34] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat eventually you can just tap reflect if your opponent thinks youre committing to absolute mash. just goes back to rock paper scissor.
[4:29:35] <braincraft> Pat, you gotta get full punishes.
[4:29:41] <bananrrr> it's important to mix in there, so that the opponent has a reason to slow down their blockstrings @AngriestPat
[4:29:42] <Worldbrand> I think anyone over like 15 would say that
[4:29:48] <xeros720> you should learn the game you never played pat
[4:29:51] <ventus_fury> @heartlessten Id say learn to play a healing class, or a tank
[4:29:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat is salty babu
[4:29:53] <Worldbrand> And some people under 10, which would be odd
[4:29:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat good job killing that 16
[4:29:57] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat any red player here knws much more than i do. ik nothing abt frames stuff besides basics.
[4:29:57] <Run44forrest> when 16 dunk hit assist
[4:30:06] <majindusto> SALTY PATTY
[4:30:06] <%Toynota10> Is Tien's 7 level super still busted?
[4:30:08] <%ThePuddingDead> I wish they gave the option to choose what kind of assist your teammates can use, give them some more versatility
[4:30:09] <Run44forrest> and super dash
[4:30:14] <+phatmac16> Shut up chat
[4:30:14] <The7thCrownLessKing> then play a character u know lol
[4:30:15] <Sofa_King_Hype> Pat, when Cooler follows up your dunk, Super Dash and then do an air combo
[4:30:17] <%TheStarbecue> i think Pat's doing pretty good for knowing next to nothing
[4:30:18] <%Cogito1001> If you were ten years young youd have found my refrence funny. I would have too
[4:30:18] <+AccioSkullar> YEET
[4:30:22] <ventus_fury> @heartlessten as every other class but 7(?) is a craft or DPS class
[4:30:24] <ShichiNoBushi> 16 needs an alt costume where he has the Capsule Corp. logo patch.
[4:30:26] <+broly_bear> Tossed LUL
[4:30:29] <%ThePuddingDead> I love teen gohan but his assist is too lame
[4:30:32] <TheShadowWolfen> yoot
[4:30:34] <+KaiserCrimson_1> That Bardock was out to end your everything with that early sparking... Good thing he dropped the combo Kappa
[4:30:44] <%RaikenTB> Just do the thing, Pat.
[4:30:47] <%Demon_Shadow4> id bardock losing to a throw kanon?
[4:30:50] <+phatmac16> Pat is doing great
[4:30:56] <%theslippybrit> out of 12 players?
[4:30:57] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat you're doing really well honestly, a lot better then what i'm gonna show you once i get my turn in
[4:30:58] <%ElenaManetta> overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer has never been more true than in these matches.
[4:31:01] <%ThePuddingDead> nj
[4:31:02] <buffmurffy> ranked 7th at being fuggins in the world
[4:31:02] <SeventyForce> 7th at been fuggin's
[4:31:05] <spooksy> man pat sure likes the large big boy characters
[4:31:10] <V1irtuousrabbit> This games neutral is mad stressful it takes time to really do good against killers esp with the new patch
[4:31:21] <+Inchoates> Yeah, Ironically Pat's bravery to just challenge with auto combo is serving him well
[4:31:22] <%TheStarbecue> kill them
[4:31:23] <%ElenaManetta> Gotta fug those fuggins
[4:31:26] <fairore> that's a good cooler voice
[4:31:26] <%theslippybrit> @ElenaManetta don't worry, its merely a trick of the light
[4:31:27] <%Toynota10> for everyone criticizing Pat, beat him in a match yourselves. Then we'll see who needs to get good
[4:31:27] <hntronium> BECOME THE ONE
[4:31:29] <%Cogito1001> There can only be 3
[4:31:29] <Worldbrand> Jet Li is #1 fuggins
[4:31:31] <%TheStarbecue> even the younglings
[4:31:31] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat nice
[4:31:33] <person181> sad to see that true fuggins is 9th
[4:31:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Devour the other Fuggins to absorb their power
[4:31:34] <%ElenaManetta> apatLiz
[4:31:35] <Run44forrest> how many fuggins chat?

[4:31:47] <KasGiD> me
[4:31:48] <CurrySauseBandit> Just frame Omega Fuggin's for all dah murder
[4:31:49] <dsauce999> You see Pat, the worse you think you are doing, the better you do via your stando powah.
[4:31:51] <+Inchoates> You would think his coward powers would manifest as a defensive playstyle with reversal supers
[4:31:56] <ventus_fury> OH NO! NOT HIM!
[4:31:57] <Sloavon> LUL
[4:31:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> shutup fuggins
[4:32:00] <%Keyd00d> NIPPLES

[4:32:04] <CalderGaming> @AngriestPat so if he's fuggins4u how does he feel about being graphically inferior to fugginsworld

[4:32:20] <bananrrr> shaggy free
[4:32:21] <%TheShal> They need to add the true villian El Hermano
[4:32:21] <+phatmac16> Manaka
[4:32:21] <Worldbrand> Wow it's a tiny pink goblin with baseball nips
[4:32:22] <DonatelloJose> Ruby fuggins is brutal, but nega fuggins is surprisingly cool.
[4:32:22] <OwlLightningMage> Shaggy you fool
[4:32:22] <mercado94> shaggy
[4:32:23] <%Cogito1001> Ed with a pebble is his shoe.
[4:32:24] <%100percentcanadianbeef> shaggy
[4:32:24] <%ghostsofcarcosa> Don't ask that question you will anger him.
[4:32:24] <majindusto> Fuck Monaka
[4:32:25] <+AccioSkullar> dunkered
[4:32:25] <alwayspronking> Elmo would win
[4:32:25] <%some_random_variable> Shaggy
[4:32:26] <%ElenaManetta> You were full HP bars for so long in that fight! GODLIKE PATRICK.
[4:32:28] <+ShmartAlec> Shaggy free

[4:32:30] <+broly_bear> Shaggy can go Ultra Instinc
[4:32:30] <WeedSpagon> Shaggy is a military deserter in canon.
[4:32:31] <DonatelloJose> Shaggy no contest
[4:32:31] <Dakuu75> they'd destroy the universe witht heir clash
[4:32:31] <person181> no one
[4:32:32] <kakdela7> El Hermano
[4:32:33] <%theslippybrit> shaggy, cus he's too dope apatLiz
[4:32:34] <Run44forrest> oh no that was other 16
[4:32:34] <ArtThouBored> Jaco first THEN Monaka
[4:32:35] <dsauce999> Which shaggy tho?
[4:32:41] <Nashingbuttons> These nerds all saying shaggy
[4:32:44] <Mattmandx1> But could either of them beat Farmer with a Shotgun?
[4:32:46] <%Toynota10> @ThePuddingDead a guy Beerus made up as a super strong opponent to motivate Goku to push himself further
[4:32:48] <%Keyd00d> wow it took you 6 bars Kappa
[4:32:50] <majindusto> Jaco is Superior
[4:32:50] <%ElenaManetta> Woody is more powerful than Shaggy
[4:32:51] <KasGiD> I'd say Monoka
[4:32:52] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I'm mad. Just opened some Girl Scout Cookie. They're the same price but the cookies got smaller 😡
[4:32:56] <SeventyForce> YEET
[4:32:58] <%TheStarbecue> RAAAAAWWWW supers
[4:33:02] <ventus_fury> He's Intergalactic Patrol!
[4:33:03] <+AccioSkullar> using 6 bars to kill a character is absolutely worth
[4:33:04] <%ThePuddingDead> Ah...
[4:33:06] <mercado94> Arale can beat both of them
[4:33:06] <%TheStarbecue> gotta love it
[4:33:07] <%Keyd00d> Woody got a MAJOR upgrade in KH3, Shaggy doesn't stand a chance
[4:33:08] <buffmurffy> shaggy from scooby doo or shaggy 2 dope?
[4:33:09] <KasGiD> Shaggy would be too distracted by his nipples
[4:33:09] <derekwst3> in the comics one of the Zamasu's took Monokas body thinking he was the strongest
[4:33:11] <%ultimatetotoro> gohan blanco is a threat
[4:33:12] <%Cogito1001> No one comprehends the power of Big Ed.
[4:33:14] <hntronium> TRIPPING
[4:33:15] <%ThePuddingDead> shame i didnt care about Super until the very last season
[4:33:20] <ShichiNoBushi> "Are you tripping?"
[4:33:26] <majindusto> Arale is Strongest!!!
[4:33:31] <ArtThouBored> Jaco is pure
[4:33:32] <%3xgilly> shaggy would be the ultimate guest character
[4:33:32] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Fucking styled on that Vegeta
[4:33:35] <+AccioSkullar> OOF

[4:33:35] <+Dovakhin573> Its fine Pat this is your DBFZ gang Initiation
[4:33:35] <Run44forrest> @Sphincter_Spelunker thin mints?
[4:33:37] <ventus_fury> I just bought Super Blurays 4-6
[4:33:37] <V1irtuousrabbit> @angriestpat Vegeta assist isn't a true blockstring you can reflect it
[4:33:39] <%ElenaManetta> Remember when Pat described in length a DBZ fan fiction and it turned out he was talking about Steven Universe? Good times.
[4:33:41] <%AdmiralButtloaf> @Sphincter_Spelunker you can get girlscout cookies at Dollar General for $1.25/box
[4:33:44] <DeanX27> And Monaka is not angry enough either
[4:33:45] <%Keyd00d> LUL

[4:34:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Note: Kiwami means plan
[4:34:16] <mercado94> why Pat
[4:34:17] <%Fenrirlives> how can you say that when there's a God of Destruction that is just Green Pat?
[4:34:17] <eldragon_1> Keikaku dori
[4:34:19] <%FrostMass22> Pat was totally right about that Steven Universe Dragon ball Z comparison
[4:34:19] <+NeonTurnip> LUL quiting is his nature
[4:34:22] <GGvonGGmcGG> I love the laziness in the character designs with Bardock, Turles and Goku Black
[4:34:22] <%ThePuddingDead> Pat's so stubborn to the point he has no idea what he's doing
[4:34:26] <%Cogito1001> You dont need to quit if you cheat
[4:34:28] <Run44forrest> Broly Calvo PogChamp
[4:34:31] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @AdmiralButtloaf If I'm going to the Dollar Store, I'm getting those gingerbread Windmills
[4:34:32] <+paladinstarbuster> BRING IT BACK AUBREON
[4:34:32] <DeanX27> Rare sight of Pat not being a coward
[4:34:36] <ventus_fury> Kiwami isn't plan o.o is it? I thought that was Keikaku
[4:34:51] <Run44forrest> Kiwami means EXTREME
[4:34:51] <Mattmandx1> Frost with his poison needles would have an interesting moveset in this
[4:34:58] <%FrostMass22> @ventus_fury Keikau means Japanese sword
[4:34:58] <Bluewind098> To be fair isn't Goku Black just a possesed Goku?
[4:35:05] <+AccioSkullar> kiwami PogChamp
[4:35:10] <%ThePuddingDead> good damage
[4:35:13] <DeanX27> @Bluewind098 Body swap

[4:35:22] <+mgs3ladderscene> huh pat didnt seem like a cooler kind of guy to me
[4:35:23] <+paladinstarbuster> he tilted
[4:35:24] <KasGiD> Yeah. Story wise Goku Black makes sense
[4:35:24] <%SvenHolgersson> Your Moobot can eat a DICK
[4:35:24] <DeanX27> Wait, no, mind swap
[4:35:25] <%TheSniperJoe> I miss the big buttercream frosting cookies in the shape of characters faces, like Elmo, Ninja Turtles, or Power Rangers that you would buy at the mall.
[4:35:25] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> Kiwami means suck cheese off the floor
[4:35:29] <KasGiD> Bardock and Turtles doin't
[4:35:29] <%ElenaManetta> YOU SAT THERE. LiKE A LUMP. THE BAG OF DORiTOS HAS SAiD MORE THAN YOU!
[4:35:31] <ventus_fury> then... "All according to Japanese Sword"? o.o
[4:35:32] <Bluewind098> same difference. If anything Black's design is pretty solid for that
[4:35:33] <Run44forrest> pat hes teaching you to reflect
[4:35:37] <eldragon_1> Lmao Frost

[4:40:42] <Bluewind098> it would be funny if pat's best character was Ginyu

[4:40:54] <Dakuu75> lol, that's like the only reason to pick ginyu is to fuck someone over with change XD
[4:40:54] <%AncelDeLambert> tRi bEaM
[4:40:56] <ShichiNoBushi> When'd Pat put Ginyu on his team?
[4:40:57] <hntronium> KIKOHO
[4:40:58] <Mattmandx1> "I'm stronger IN the corner!"
[4:41:00] <%Cogito1001> Pocket ginyu sounds like A FUN STRAT
[4:41:00] <%ThePuddingDead> good ol milky cannon
[4:41:00] <%ElenaManetta> YAY PAT!
[4:41:03] <%AncelDeLambert> It's Ki Kohou, you degenerate
[4:41:03] <+johnny_volcano> Gosh darn, I miss yellow square battles. Those were the days.
[4:41:07] <%ElenaManetta> oh wait he lost
[4:41:07] <ventus_fury> can you swap back in that situation?
[4:41:08] <Sofa_King_Hype> You think a man named Captain isn't going to have the killer Ginyu?
[4:41:09] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL LUL LUL
[4:41:09] <dsauce999> Pock-Gin POG
[4:41:12] <IOptimusGrimes> @dakuu75 wrong, ginyu OD

[4:41:16] <hntronium> COWARD
[4:41:19] <DeanX27> Gonna quote a post here and say being a Captain Ginyu means you get to play the DLC characters for free
[4:41:20] <flattopswag> cowarding again
[4:41:20] <%Toynota10> Ginyu's the shit
[4:41:20] <%SvenHolgersson> Ginyu should pose in the new body big miss

[4:41:24] <+mgs3ladderscene> >didnt go for the run back
[4:41:24] <KiraKamixephos> freeeeza
[4:41:26] <%TheStarbecue> Pat would you go to a DBFZ tourney (even at your skill level) if Red Bull sponsered you for it ?
[4:41:27] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat 18. So when you see me IAD 95% im going overhead. Why i do it so much is bc it forces you to block even if you hold up, mash wake super, wake vanish. All characters i think can IAD hs. After you reflect a single hit you can mash L for auto or free combo. Dont look at flashy stuff. Just look for that ONE move (trick) tht opens you up (works in general)
[4:41:27] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Ginyu has such a goofy ability, it's the best
[4:41:28] <kevin95_> WADUUUUPP
[4:41:28] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> I always wondered if that was ginyus original body
[4:41:31] <+broly_bear> Ginyu vs Jojo
[4:41:37] <%Hilleltaco> You can only swap back if you have a Ginyu too
[4:41:38] <Mattmandx1> You also lose access to the Ginyu Force summons if you're swapped
[4:41:40] <%SvenHolgersson> PATTT
[4:41:44] <%ElenaManetta> I don't know who that purple man was but I will guess... He is the captain of an evil fleet with other aliens on board.
[4:41:44] <%Toynota10> Ok, but what if you use Ginyu's body swap on Ginyu?
[4:41:51] <hntronium> Patrick Cowardvinn
[4:41:56] <Run44forrest> you ginyu
[4:41:57] <%TheStarbecue> on no, its LAGTIME
[4:42:00] <%SvenHolgersson> Cooler's right hand man knows
[4:42:03] <lozscat> Coward pat
[4:42:04] <nina9669> 0 0?
[4:42:07] <ventus_fury> Only someone one person knows and I think it was someone small like Zarbon or Jeice?
[4:42:08] <Run44forrest> guess this Lag Mix Up
[4:42:09] <%dking0000> I like the idea of someone using Ginyu just to fuck the other person up
[4:42:11] <%Keyd00d> Well in the new movie he has this body 41 years ago
[4:42:17] <dsauce999> @AngriestPat just use your lagswitch Kappa
[4:42:26] <%ElenaManetta> I thought he played against Lillinette
[4:42:28] <hntronium> Lili? How many times have you fought this one already?
[4:42:29] <%Toynota10> OOOOOOOOOOOOF THE LAG
[4:42:31] <%AncelDeLambert> Lili AGAIN?
[4:42:38] <flattopswag> He's played against this person 3 times now
[4:42:40] <buffmurffy> can you body swap an opponent's ginyu?
[4:42:42] <DrkJP520> Ginyu's original body is Bubbles
[4:42:43] <ShichiNoBushi> Body Swap is a technique Ginyu himself knows and would defeat the purpose allowing the target to just swap back. But it would also be awkward to program to replace one of the original Ginyu player's specials with the technique to swap back.
[4:42:47] <KiraKamixephos> Aw no fair I left after our set
[4:42:55] <%TheStarbecue> this must be the power of ultra instinct
[4:42:55] <DracaenaLeaf> those grunts are too loud
[4:42:56] <Run44forrest> Pat getting Big and Strong?
[4:42:56] <DonatelloJose> Why didn’t ginyu steal Freiza’s body?
[4:42:56] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat's getting a LOT of 18 practice
[4:43:00] <Mattmandx1> @Keyd00d Aliens have longer lifespans than humans on average in the DB universe so 41 years probably doesn't seem as long to them
[4:43:07] <%TehPryceIsRight> people ruining it by legit staying in the lobby
[4:43:09] <Dakuu75> @dsauce999 lol yeah, he has it rigged like a foot-pedal so it stays off screen XD
[4:43:15] <%AncelDeLambert> @DonatelloJose loyalty
[4:43:20] <majindusto> Can we get Bojack DLC?
[4:43:21] <%3xgilly> G H O S T
[4:43:26] <gottigotbundles> yea I couldn't get in so I left
[4:43:29] <%3xgilly> B L O W J O B
[4:43:30] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Oh right, Bojack
[4:43:36] <dsauce999> Is Ultra-Instinct just a lagswitch?
[4:43:42] <%ThePuddingDead> 17 so cool :3
[4:43:44] <DonatelloJose> @anceldelambert fair enough.
[4:43:47] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@ventus_fury) (warning)
[4:43:48] <Run44forrest> whos fat guy with the sword? they should put him in the game
[4:43:49] <dsauce999> Hidden offscreen?
[4:43:49] <ShichiNoBushi> Blow your load, Pat.
[4:43:52] <wolf_hurricane> 17 is shit
[4:43:53] <%FrostMass22> This game needs more Gokus
[4:43:57] <ventus_fury> my bad moobot
[4:43:57] <wolf_hurricane> worst character in the game bar none
[4:43:58] <%ElenaManetta> Practice in a fighting game feels like it doesn't matter unless it's consistent.
[4:43:58] <%SvenHolgersson> ^
[4:44:00] <%AncelDeLambert> Also Frieza was probably fast enough to MURDER his ass if he tried
[4:44:02] <%TheStarbecue> ultra instinct is a lag, yess
[4:44:03] <hntronium> Pat could you kick that person? Hogging the fights with you is bad.
[4:44:04] <%Niney_Who> Fucking Add Demon King Piccolo, Arale, and Master Roshi
[4:44:08] <%ElenaManetta> mOOBOT IS A FUCK
[4:44:11] <wolf_hurricane> like there's literally no reason to play 17, he's fucking trash
[4:44:15] <%TheStarbecue> Goku has the worst connection
[4:44:18] <%SvenHolgersson> Dragon rush him back
[4:44:24] <%ElenaManetta> Moobot fucks his father and curses out his mother
[4:44:25] <%Toynota10> @wolf_hurricane worse than Majin Buu?
[4:44:30] <eldragon_1> Arale would be dope
[4:44:30] <Nashingbuttons> Well, he's fun. I'd absolutely play him if he were better.
[4:44:30] <Chumblago13> 17 is good
[4:44:31] <%ElenaManetta> Fuck you Moobot you fucking heathen
[4:44:31] <wolf_hurricane> by a huge margin
[4:44:34] <wolf_hurricane> no he isn't
[4:44:36] <%TheStarbecue> !bracket
[4:44:38] <SamTheeSeagull> Majin Buu is really good
[4:44:39] <wolf_hurricane> 17 is the worst character in the game
[4:44:40] <SuiZideD> I'll be the ONE TO KILL-UUUUGUHGH
[4:44:40] <majindusto> I would love Arale in Fighterz!!!
[4:44:42] <wolf_hurricane> everyone knows this
[4:44:43] <SamTheeSeagull> so idk what you mean
[4:44:48] <ventus_fury> Wewt
[4:44:55] <ventus_fury> Sodasodasoda
[4:44:57] <WeedSpagon> I thought Nappa was the worst
[4:45:00] <wolf_hurricane> this is universally agreed upon by players
[4:45:03] <wolf_hurricane> 17 is TERRIBLE
[4:45:04] <%TheStarbecue> guys wheres the bracket at
[4:45:05] <%Aitch971> @wolf_hurricane how about enjoying the character? No shame in rocking a lowtier you love
[4:45:06] <KiraKamixephos> 17 is so bad people don’t put him on their tier list
[4:45:09] <Chumblago13> he's actually pretty good, just play him right. r
[4:45:09] <%SvenHolgersson> Nappa's not even close
[4:45:10] <Dakuu75> 18 knows the destructo-disk?!?!?! wut?!
[4:45:16] <DonatelloJose> Elena has found Moobot’s weakness. It can’t touch us if we don’t use caps!
[4:45:16] <wolf_hurricane> @Chumblago13 LUL
[4:45:17] <Griffithdid9elleven> 17 was the top mvp dont talk shit
[4:45:17] <ShichiNoBushi> Needs Super 17.
[4:45:18] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> More like the devs do
[4:45:21] <IOptimusGrimes> @chumblago13 lmao no he's trash
[4:45:23] <%SvenHolgersson> Blue goku and Vegeta are way worse
[4:45:24] <flattopswag> I never see pros use him, so I assume he's not great
[4:45:24] <%JustSayAnything> Someone won a major with 17, didn't they?
[4:45:26] <%ThePuddingDead> oh my lord...
[4:45:26] <majindusto> Krillin taught her
[4:45:26] <Mattmandx1> @WeedSpagon Nappa was buffed a lot so he's mid-tier now, he was in the bottom at launch though
[4:45:27] <Chumblago13> but its totally okay to have different opinions
[4:45:29] <%ElenaManetta> mOOBOT CAN'T DO SHIT if I USE LOWER CASE oNCE IN AWHILE
[4:45:31] <Run44forrest> a17 19 frame delay is top tier
[4:45:32] <gottigotbundles> can you kick some people so others can get in and ind increase the size to 8 players?
[4:45:32] <wolf_hurricane> @JustSayAnything LUL no they didn't
[4:45:33] <%TheStarbecue> 17 is top of the tier list with lag
[4:45:34] <%Toynota10> but he's so cool tho
[4:45:35] <Nashingbuttons> I hate the 17 wank in Super, but I loved playing him in this.
[4:45:37] <%ThePuddingDead> come ooooon pat
[4:45:40] <ventus_fury> 18 is Krillins wife... so not bad if she learned it
[4:45:44] <CurrySauseBandit> Goku can too iirc.
[4:45:49] <DonatelloJose> Kreygasm
[4:45:54] <N_Wolfwood> people wor
[4:45:57] <wolf_hurricane> goku and vegeta blue at least have *some* stuff
[4:45:59] <dsauce999> Maximumer
[4:46:00] <wolf_hurricane> 17 is ASS
[4:46:00] <+TheHeroAppears> pat's not bald enough to do it
[4:46:01] <majindusto> Frieza ripped it off
[4:46:03] <Run44forrest> pat getting Bigger and Stronger
[4:46:06] <+johnny_volcano> Pat, when you down him in the corner, just get ready to 2H - they vanish outta the corner like crazy
[4:46:06] <%SvenHolgersson> Pat you should vanish more
[4:46:07] <%ThePuddingDead> does anyone play as 21 anymore?
[4:46:11] <+KaiserCrimson_1> Everyone stole it from seeing Krillin do it once tho
[4:46:14] <Millia_Sparkle> you did great pat
[4:46:14] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Stream hog
[4:46:14] <SamTheeSeagull> Is this PC or PS4?
[4:46:15] <IOptimusGrimes> @thepuddingdead 21 OD
[4:46:19] <%ElenaManetta> The thousands of people lined up to fight their hero, Patrick Boivin
[4:46:20] <Chumblago13> @wolf_hurricane Did a 17 troll you?
[4:46:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Paige The Snake Quote is "Dummy THICC" Not Dumb and thick. Ya'll need to stop ruining memes....Wait Paige did you get THICC too
[4:46:23] <wolf_hurricane> @SamTheeSeagull check the buttons
[4:46:23] <ventus_fury> Hey, there i am
[4:46:24] <Run44forrest> i never unlocked A21
[4:46:25] <%TheStarbecue> shave his balls
[4:46:27] <%Toynota10> Ok we get it you don't like 17
[4:46:28] <Worldbrand> If you're bald a camel will lick you
[4:46:28] <%TheStarbecue> i mean bald
[4:46:29] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> why
[4:46:35] <wolf_hurricane> @Chumblago13 no, but you're trolling cat by telling people 17 isn't terrible
[4:46:35] <%ironshah> ???
[4:46:36] <%rdark_ksu> i shave my head why the fuck would i have a barber do it? you just need a razor
[4:46:38] <+Shastafield> LUL
[4:46:41] <%Prism_Wing> Wow, look how far we've come lol.
[4:46:44] <+johnny_volcano> NO NO NO THEY are the ones vanishing
[4:46:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> If pat shaved his head and his beard he'd look like an angry testicle.
[4:46:47] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> How could you not buzz yourself
[4:46:48] <DonatelloJose> Fuggins beat me to it.
[4:46:49] <Mattmandx1> Cell was a vore fetish villain before #21 made it popular
[4:46:49] <+johnny_volcano> You just need to punish it with 2H
[4:46:54] <%SvenHolgersson> On wakeup usually
[4:46:57] <%ElenaManetta> ALMOST Team Goku
[4:46:58] <buffmurffy> vanish works as a way to get the kill
[4:47:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Anybdoy else notice how Thicc paige got...whats going on is this Lupus
[4:47:04] <%SvenHolgersson> also a great ender
[4:47:05] <+johnny_volcano> YES
[4:47:06] <%Fenrirlives> Nah Cell was an Inflation Villain
[4:47:06] <IOptimusGrimes> @svenholgersson don't vanish on wakeup lmfaooo
[4:47:07] <Chumblago13> @wolf_hurricane im not trolling. he isnt the worst but i can understand why you wouldn't like him.
[4:47:07] <+chernyk0> well im sad now, so long space boy cows
[4:47:10] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> The only way to fuck up a buzz is to get the wrong clip size
[4:47:14] <%ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat I've tried practicing vanishing when doing aerials...that seems to be the most consistant strategy from what I've done
[4:47:14] <Bluewind098> You can't follow up off of raw. You can still combo off it
[4:47:16] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> 2H
[4:47:18] <wolf_hurricane> no he 100% is the worst character in the game
[4:47:18] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@V1irtuousrabbit)
[4:47:19] <%Toynota10> SUper dash?
[4:47:22] <+johnny_volcano> No no, you don't vanish
[4:47:22] <IOptimusGrimes> do not vanish on wake up lmfao you gonna get blown up for that
[4:47:25] <Run44forrest> when i get killed by vanish i get a lil salty
[4:47:28] <ventus_fury> (Mentally prepping self)
[4:47:28] <Nashingbuttons> Hakuna your tatas, geeze.
[4:47:28] <wolf_hurricane> like this is almost universally agreed upon
[4:47:31] <DonatelloJose> DO COMBO
[4:47:32] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat vanish on wakeup gets punished by a lot of things
[4:47:41] <KiraKamixephos> Then get ready to hit them again
[4:47:42] <%SvenHolgersson> but it is fun
[4:47:50] <ShichiNoBushi> Perfectly symmetrical fighting is going to get us nowhere.
[4:47:54] <Bluewind098> You can use vanish in combos to extend. Otherwise it's basically a tracking heavy attack
[4:47:57] <Chumblago13> If you say so friend.
[4:48:08] <Rikui_> @AngriestPat if vanish is blocked do pressure, if it hit extend with assist
[4:48:10] <+SoriduSnaku> raw vanish you cant combo off usually but in a combo in the air it will bounce them off the wall for a grab or special
[4:48:22] <+KaiserCrimson_1> Vanish > 5H / 2H > combo usually works well enough. Just don't be predictable with it
[4:48:23] <hntronium> Looking at the chat, it doesn't look like 17 being bad is universally agreed upon.
[4:48:29] <%ElenaManetta> Please... Change... The stage... It's bad enough we gotta stare at your ugly green couch and stone wall, I can't deal with this same city for 2 hours.
[4:48:33] <%TheStarbecue> if you are airbourne , you can vanish and mash Dragon Rush for a free grab. hold an assist button during grab to snap them out @AngriestPat
[4:48:39] <kakdela7> you get a wall bounce if you vanish after an attack
[4:48:41] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat Cooler can do a cool extend where if you vanish and get the wall bounce, you can put them into your Auto Combo pretty easy
[4:48:41] <%ThePuddingDead> goodness
[4:48:46] <ShichiNoBushi> For a moment, I thought 16 was wearing a jeans jacket.
[4:48:48] <%SvenHolgersson> Couch hater over here
[4:48:48] <TheGershon> Future Yajirobe has a beard!
[4:48:58] <Run44forrest> pat you should look up some combo
[4:49:00] <Mattmandx1> Vanish after a hard hit to either connect it to a dragon rush or if it's low to the ground do a quick dash forward and pick them up with crouching medium
[4:49:09] <jojoagain> hey pat, do you think you'll try anthem demo ?
[4:49:09] <%SvenHolgersson> like vanish after the aerial combo for more
[4:49:09] <%ThePuddingDead> like a fat buu with diabetes....slowly rolls down the stairs losing his breathe....makes me sad thinking about it
[4:49:12] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat keep in mind that this is pretty much as far as You get without Lab Time, you're doing fantastic tho!
[4:49:12] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat if you wanna use it defensively and get out, just make the timing awkward for your opponent. like wait 2 secs if you knw they theyll anti air and make them whiff
[4:49:16] <KiraKamixephos> I guess 17 can be good if you’re not playing against top level players
[4:49:23] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Elena decrees you change the stage, chop chop coxS
[4:49:24] <%ElenaManetta> JESUS
[4:49:26] <%3xgilly> how can you ever get tired of west city
[4:49:36] <flattopswag> @jojoagain He's making a poll on Twitter tomorrow for either that or For Honor :)
[4:49:41] <+HalfDecent_Gaming> @AngriestPat vanish in air and dragon rush after wall bounce if you wanna tag their character out
[4:49:43] <%SvenHolgersson> RAWWWW
[4:49:43] <+ilasper1> this guys a wild animal
[4:49:44] <+SoriduSnaku> vanish is also good for extending blockstrings but not so much in the recent patch
[4:49:46] <+paladinstarbuster> RAW SUPERS
[4:49:46] <Dakuu75> there's a way to add more bars to gohan's super there, right?
[4:49:49] <Run44forrest> Pat Reflect the LVL 3
[4:49:53] <%Toynota10> just raw super all day
[4:49:56] <%ElenaManetta> HEY! The CITY CHANGED!!!! Holy shit
[4:49:57] <%Sovspot> is this game not dead anymore?
[4:50:02] <Worldbrand> can they be pro tips about gardening?
[4:50:05] <zamzoph> "git gud"
[4:50:07] <Bluewind098> was it ever dead?
[4:50:08] <IOptimusGrimes> @sovspot lmfao never was
[4:50:11] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat guess ill make twitter for you pat lolllll
[4:50:13] <ventus_fury> I'm next i think after this guy
[4:50:13] <%SvenHolgersson> Yup
[4:50:14] <%3xgilly> Pat if I could play you I would but im on PC and my internet isnt good...its a lose lose
[4:50:16] <Mattmandx1> @Dakuu75 Yeah just keep the buttons held down if he has at least 5 bars
[4:50:18] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> play the game more than once a year
[4:50:18] <%TheStarbecue> NICE, proud of you dad
[4:50:23] <+TheHeroAppears> thanks fuggins
[4:50:26] <%Fenrirlives> HE'S BACK IN!
[4:50:26] <%Cogito1001> Why not ask woolie?
[4:50:26] <OwlLightningMage> FE PogChamp
[4:50:27] <DonatelloJose> He didn’t say the pro tips had to be abit this game
[4:50:27] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat tbh pay attention most ot red tag players.
[4:50:28] <%Toynota10> Wait who needs fire emblem tips?
[4:50:29] <Run44forrest> pat dont do over head that breaks the combo
[4:50:30] <Sofa_King_Hype> @AngriestPat Use the 2M, 5M start to your combos more so when you end your air combo, you can go from another ground combo to another air combo
[4:50:30] <%Keyd00d> KAKAROT
[4:50:32] <OwlLightningMage> Use Ike all the time
[4:50:32] <wolf_hurricane> LMAO at people thinking GT characters will be in the game
[4:50:35] <%ThePuddingDead> cant wait for new broly who can read
[4:50:40] <OwlLightningMage> Ike is OP busted
[4:50:42] <%SvenHolgersson> Vanish is great for extentions but you gotta know/have the right character
[4:50:46] <hntronium> Future Bulma is hot
[4:50:46] <%ThePuddingDead> or at least say more
[4:50:48] <Bluewind098> it's dependant on combos
[4:50:51] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> you need to wave dash more
[4:50:52] <%ElenaManetta> Is Broly's body hard or soft? Are his big muscles like a hippo's skin
[4:50:52] <%Sovspot> I thought something happened with parent company that killed this game
[4:50:54] <DonatelloJose> Damn it fuggins you’re stealing my bits before I’m done typing them
[4:50:55] <OwlLightningMage> Yo who needs some FE tips PogChamp
[4:50:55] <+Superstarsage> Do it in an air combo to do the uh dash attack thing to force a swap
[4:50:55] <Dakuu75> @Mattmandx1 is it like, a 3 bar super on its own and 5 if you hold it? something liek that?
[4:50:58] <%AncelDeLambert> jjust watch Woolie's shit
[4:50:59] <wolf_hurricane> There will be a new MvC before there are GT characters in DBFZ
[4:51:00] <%ThePuddingDead> nj
[4:51:03] <ventus_fury> I don't think GT would make it considering even Funi doesn't like it anymore
[4:51:04] <ShichiNoBushi> Nice.
[4:51:05] <Bluewind098> There isn't really easy vanish setups outside of snaps
[4:51:08] <%NWR_James> give chat CHAOS LEGION tips
[4:51:11] <%Aitch971> just do combo
[4:51:14] <%SvenHolgersson> Some characters can't really get much out of vanish compared to others
[4:51:15] <%AncelDeLambert> that is NOT cheating
[4:51:15] <Run44forrest> not cheating
[4:51:19] <%ElenaManetta> Donate to Woolie's shit
[4:51:21] <Nashingbuttons> Give chat desert bus tips
[4:51:23] <hntronium> How is that cheating?
[4:51:29] <%TheStarbecue> yea, after a wallbounce combo, run up and 2m, 5m jumpcancel and do combo @AngriestPat
[4:51:29] <%Cogito1001> How and why do you care?
[4:51:31] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat jaaah for snapping. Pat it depends what your plan is. Its moment to moment. Do you want to get rid of a character tht gives you problems like a vegeta, snap him in. Low health? Swap them in.
[4:51:33] <Chumblago13> Manner of pride?
[4:51:33] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> don't forget to ledge gaurd
[4:51:34] <kakdela7> if you get a vanish bounce low enough to the ground you can do a low medium into a jump cancel combo
[4:51:39] <%Fenrirlives> PAT YOU CHEAT EVERYDAy
[4:51:40] <%AncelDeLambert> "My friend is too strong, listening to his advice would make me a god"
[4:51:43] <dsauce999> Chat, did you know relying on resources to improve yourself is cheating? who knew?
[4:51:45] <Worldbrand> desert bus tip: rig a fan to slap you on the face every 5 minutes to stay awake
[4:51:46] <Bluewind098> how is taking advice from your co worker who knows fighting games cheating?
[4:51:47] <%ElenaManetta> Patrick "I won't do that, that's cheating" Boivin
[4:51:56] <KiraKamixephos> Wouldn’t woolies shit be outdated? I’m sure there’s better options
[4:52:11] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat Don't forget to 6H as Cooler, he's got a nasty stomp that's a good low
[4:52:12] <+BishopBain> Heard 16 got nerfed in to the ground.
[4:52:13] <%Cogito1001> @KiraKamixephos he could literally just ask him
[4:52:13] <Millia_Sparkle> @KiraKamixephos its fundamentals
[4:52:16] <%AncelDeLambert> Patrick "Just Cheat" Boivin
[4:52:16] <IOptimusGrimes> @kirakamixephos it's just the basics
[4:52:16] <Mattmandx1> @Dakuu75 3 bars normally but you can burn an extra 2 bars for more damage. SSJBlue Goku and Vegeta can do the same thing. Beerus and Ginyu can do it with their level 1's
[4:52:19] <%SvenHolgersson> Pat "Loves to cheat" Boivin- I won't cheat
[4:52:21] <+mgs3ladderscene> is woolie even still into dbfz he made his videos super early into the game
[4:52:25] <Sofa_King_Hype> @AngriestPat if you do the vanish from jump cancel height you can extend combos easy
[4:52:25] <%ElenaManetta> @AncelDeLambert I've seen photos of Woolie beating God. I mean he commissioned them, but I still saw them.
[4:52:28] <Run44forrest> pat combo go l m h stop going l m l
[4:52:28] <%TheStarbecue> this is a cool team, biggy big boys
[4:52:29] <hntronium> RAW SUPERS?
[4:52:31] <Chumblago13> I think the nature of fighting games makes a difference? i guess
[4:52:32] <helpmeimafruit> who would win, perfect cell or roshi armed with an atomic bomb
[4:52:35] <%ThePuddingDead> fat hands
[4:52:35] <%TheStarbecue> ooooh that low is NASTY
[4:52:42] <IOptimusGrimes> team "gets fuzzied"
[4:52:45] <Dakuu75> @Mattmandx1 sic, thanks~
[4:52:48] <%AncelDeLambert> Those photos are accurate, they were commisioned for historical purposes
[4:52:49] <Ion_LaserX> @helpmeimafruit Perfect Cell
[4:52:52] <OwlLightningMage> @helpmeimafruit I see what you did there LUL
[4:52:53] <%TheStarbecue> lolol team get fuzzied
[4:52:56] <%ElenaManetta> Fuggins isn't gonna get home until like 2AM at this rate.
[4:52:56] <%SvenHolgersson> He no like Broccoli
[4:53:03] <+AccioSkullar> Netero zfgAnyway
[4:53:04] <Bluewind098> I'm not sure what fighting Woolie plays. Most likely SFV and Dragonball. Hasn't talked about it recently
[4:53:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat nothing like going on twitter to give you tips and seeing sonicfox calling out some dude who threw his name out for no reason again
[4:53:14] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat Nice grab
[4:53:15] <%ThePuddingDead> YAY!!!
[4:53:16] <ventus_fury> ouch
[4:53:16] <%TheStarbecue> LMAOOOO
[4:53:16] <+ilasper1> lmao
[4:53:16] <Run44forrest> YEEEEEEEhaahaa
[4:53:17] <+AccioSkullar> YEA YEA YEA
[4:53:17] <%ElenaManetta> I hope Fuggins takes a cab home so he doesn't get raped.

[4:53:27] <%ThePuddingDead> now call it
[4:53:30] <%SvenHolgersson> GOKU SPAWN DOWN
[4:53:30] <Chumblago13> well then
[4:53:30] <%ThePuddingDead> leave now
[4:53:31] <OwlLightningMage> Pat had no other option PogChamp
[4:53:32] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat Dont overthink for fancy stuff. Just work on fundamentals. A small bnb goes a really long way
[4:53:36] <KasGiD> Nothing I could have done
[4:53:42] <%Toynota10> So if 16 is your front man, who is your battery and tank?
[4:53:43] <+KaiserCrimson_1> I was about to say that it was too obvious, but somehow it worked anyway lol
[4:53:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat i want my rematch against you
[4:53:44] <%JJCheeker> gg patron
[4:53:45] <ventus_fury> OOOH NO

[4:53:58] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat illl just make a twitter and bother you later lol
[4:54:03] <JJAllDay> lol
[4:54:04] <%SvenHolgersson> Play on PC coward then I can lose too
[4:54:05] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @ElenaManetta Fuckin wow. Chill the hell out
[4:54:05] <Bluewind098> well that stuff is shit you lab and look up stuff for
[4:54:09] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat I can teach you some Cooler stuff. What's the best way to reach you?
[4:54:15] <%Toynota10> My bad, point and anchor is what i meant
[4:54:19] <Rikui_> Lillinette still in LUL
[4:54:19] <%3xgilly> you only played them once
[4:54:22] <JJAllDay> @johnny_volcano Probably through twitter
[4:54:25] <Run44forrest> dont worry about all that learn some bnb first
[4:54:28] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat i was the ginyu, i just want my rematch, for battery, i can send you a link to characters
[4:54:30] <Sofa_King_Hype> @AngriestPat You have an assist follow up with a 16 dunk to Cooler
[4:54:31] <+KaiserCrimson_1> You don't know KOF lingo Pat?
[4:54:35] <%TheStarbecue> im gonna make a twitter just for this
[4:54:38] <%ThatGuyfromMars> hit the buttons and beat the guy
[4:54:40] <guppy_> LUL
[4:54:41] <%Typhaeon> AngriestFuggs
[4:54:43] <%AncelDeLambert> Everyone DM Pat and then tell him to consult Woolie
[4:54:45] <%ElenaManetta> It's Fuggins4u4u
[4:54:46] <$TC_Lagann> Fuggins for president
[4:54:46] <Pookiedaexzile> These Nerds aint got no tweeda
[4:54:47] <%JJCheeker> tweetur
[4:54:49] <Bluewind098> To be honest it's better than me who's played Smash Ultimate for a month and still doesn't completely understand neutral in Smash
[4:54:50] <lozscat> LUL
[4:54:52] <%Skeletorexplains> @Fuggins4U Do a dab...
[4:54:55] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat for ppl on twitter make sure theyre red tag players at least not orange. Theyre often times legit
[4:54:59] <Bro_dirt> Man i want to get into this game but i just get combod for 15 seonds and die
[4:55:01] <gottigotbundles> finally got in. thank you guy who left
[4:55:02] <%Cogito1001> Tell woolie to make an alt account to give pat tips
[4:55:04] <%DedlokPM> apatDab
[4:55:06] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat Android 16's Medium Air Dunk is pretty convenient to add assists to extend
[4:55:08] <%Skeletorexplains> apatDab
[4:55:10] <%SvenHolgersson> 16 H SO deadly
[4:55:13] <Mattmandx1> Anchors are good on their own and the last ones alive, points are the first character that build meter and work well with assists and middles have good assists and can back their point up if they run low on health
[4:55:14] <Chumblago13> Its not a game for everyone
[4:55:19] <%AncelDeLambert> Tell Woolie to put a helmet on like Racer X and secretly coach Pat
[4:55:21] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat Attaboy
[4:55:24] <wolf_hurricane> can we take a sec to laugh at MvC fans?
[4:55:27] <wolf_hurricane> LUL
[4:55:28] <wolf_hurricane> thanks
[4:55:30] <Nashingbuttons> no
[4:55:31] <%ElenaManetta> What fans
[4:55:35] <%TheStarbecue> i would love for Pat to surprise Woolie with some wins against him
[4:55:37] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> FeelsBadMan
[4:55:37] <hntronium> LUL
[4:55:37] <Chumblago13> no
[4:55:39] <%SvenHolgersson> Why laugh at noone
[4:55:43] <nina9669> LUL
[4:55:44] <Cobaltor_252> fuckin owning holy shit
[4:56:00] <wolf_hurricane> you guys'd be surprised, people still play HnK
[4:56:01] <KasGiD> I believe in you Ventus
[4:56:03] <%SvenHolgersson> The best??
[4:56:03] <spooksy> fun
[4:56:05] <FruitBasketVidya> pat just got crushed by a person with no wins
[4:56:06] <wolf_hurricane> there are a few dumbasses who still play Marve
[4:56:06] <%Cogito1001> Capcom a company that takes as many Ls as it does Ws
[4:56:13] <+ilasper1> this is probably the easiest one though
[4:56:13] <$TC_Lagann> @wolf_hurricane i ACTUALLY forgot that game existed, i honetly though "mvc3 was great, why the laugh?"
[4:56:15] <%TheStarbecue> this is the snance
[4:56:15] <Millia_Sparkle> hate dbz fighterz. i miss guilty gear and ultimax. even blazblue sometimes lol
[4:56:15] <%ElenaManetta> NO!!!
[4:56:17] <%Cogito1001> balance is key
[4:56:20] <%JJCheeker> what is MvC? Kappa
[4:56:31] <Captain_Aham> 0_/_/
[4:56:32] <%ElenaManetta> You were almost Big HP Bars Boivin. So close.
[4:56:33] <Chumblago13> real shame
[4:56:35] <Run44forrest> whats another game like dbfz? its really what got me into fighting games
[4:56:36] <%TheStarbecue> lololololol clownshoes
[4:56:37] <majindusto> Pat is Whooping Ass!!!
[4:56:39] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> guilty gear is great
[4:56:41] <ThePoopinator9001> As Broly, if you land his 236M, you can call16's assist and then use his light autocombo.
[4:56:42] <ventus_fury> Wooooo
[4:56:48] <%SvenHolgersson> GG rules and has some great waifus
[4:56:53] <%AncelDeLambert> hasn't GG always been big?
[4:56:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You can do it Ventus!
[4:56:57] <%shivhappy22> just give me p5 arena and I'll be happy.
[4:56:57] <KasGiD> For BB and GG yes
[4:56:57] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat DBFZ? No. GG? Absolutely
[4:56:58] <NumberTooBig> Guilty Gear is the best fighter on the market
[4:56:59] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat i mean i keep trying to get good here to the point i lost technical skill and now i mash.
[4:56:59] <KasGiD> DBFz nah
[4:57:00] <KiraKamixephos> @angriestpat you don’t gotta lvl 1 after every hit. Save up for a level three instead, it’ll leave you in a more advantageous position
[4:57:00] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Unlike NRS games, that lose steam within the year
[4:57:03] <%TheStarbecue> sometimes getting into matches is a pain
[4:57:05] <+arfafax> Kappa
[4:57:08] <%Cogito1001> Only waifu you need is Baiken.
[4:57:11] <%AncelDeLambert> like, I heard about GG back in high school, and none of my friends were big into fighting games
[4:57:12] <Mattmandx1> The old Guilty Gears are great, Xrd added some bad mechanics that pushed me away from it
[4:57:15] <%TehPryceIsRight> Big ups to people who didnt just sit in the lobby like Lillianette
[4:57:16] <%SvenHolgersson> DBFZ on PC is pretty happenin right now so not really
[4:57:16] <Finakala> Faust best waifu
[4:57:25] <V1irtuousrabbit> guilty gear is a dead game lmao capcom refugees dont wanna play a mans game where they have to think
[4:57:28] <%AncelDeLambert> and high school was 15 years ago for me
[4:57:28] <%TheStarbecue> PAT is EVOLVING
[4:57:32] <Sofa_King_Hype> @AngriestPat Use super dash when you get that Cooler assist on 16's dunk
[4:57:34] <nina9669> only Baiken TPFufun
[4:57:34] <wolf_hurricane> "the old guilty gears are great"
[4:57:36] <Rikui_> @Run44forrest blazblue cross tag battle is pretty similar imo
[4:57:37] <wolf_hurricane> wrong
[4:57:38] <wolf_hurricane> OG GG sucks
[4:57:40] <wolf_hurricane> X is mediocre
[4:57:40] <KiraKamixephos> I think it depends what rank you are
[4:57:44] <wolf_hurricane> XX is the one everyone likes
[4:57:45] <Millia_Sparkle> PAT WILL EVOLVE
[4:57:46] <+Kaito_Cam> Did anyone see when then entire Dragon Ball Super Broly movie was on youtube.
[4:57:47] <Chumblago13> chat is...interesting tonight
[4:57:47] <majindusto> EVOLVE or DIE
[4:57:50] <%Cogito1001> @nina9669 Only Baiken.
[4:57:50] <KiraKamixephos> Always get matches at ss3
[4:57:54] <gottigotbundles> I'll show you some broly stuff when we play
[4:57:54] <Run44forrest> i didnt like the bb cross tag beta
[4:57:55] <KasGiD> Yes

[4:58:03] <wolf_hurricane> @Chumblago13 made interesting by the idiot who thinks 17 is good LUL
[4:58:06] <DeanX27> It more or less did.
[4:58:06] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> thats hilarious

[4:58:13] <%SvenHolgersson> It's meh
[4:58:14] <sponsoredviewer910> LUL
[4:58:14] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> The guy names his profile off a little girl from Bleach. What other behavior would you expect?
[4:58:17] <Run44forrest> it was at evo???
[4:58:21] <wolf_hurricane> BBTag is about MvCI-tier in playercount LUL
[4:58:23] <+KaiserCrimson_1> I love GG, but boy howdy do I miss AC+R Potemkin...
[4:58:23] <waifoong98> Fuck BBTag and its cash grab shit

[4:58:27] <wolf_hurricane> no one
[4:58:29] <%Ninestempest> yeah it was at evo even though it came out like a month before
[4:58:37] <wolf_hurricane> who hurt you to give oyu the brain damage to think 17 is good
[4:58:38] <%Toynota10> I'd love to see some KOF13 online!
[4:58:38] <%Ninestempest> and mvci wasn't at evo lmao

[4:58:51] <%TheStarbecue> @AngriestPat you can also vanish if you hit on shield to save yourself, but it is reactable so use it sapringly
[4:58:51] <%ElenaManetta> For someone named AngriestPat, you're pretty relaxed for doing 10 online fighting matches in a row.
[4:58:52] <+Kaito_Cam> @TC_Lagann Same here. I'd already seen it in IMAX... I may have watched on youtube though

[4:59:21] <V1irtuousrabbit> @nina9669 Why was that so funny to me
[4:59:26] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Tom Brady take notes
[4:59:27] <Run44forrest> NotSoAngryPat
[4:59:28] <Bluewind098> I'd want to ask where the Cross Tag community is but it seems like I'm not going to get anything other than a meme answer here
[4:59:28] <$TC_Lagann> @Kaito_Cam i already went to theaters to see it twice, so i figured it was fine to watch it whilst on youtube LUL
[4:59:30] <%Keyd00d> LUL
[4:59:33] <nina9669> TearGlove TearGlove TearGlove
[4:59:35] <%rdark_ksu> pats anger is about weird esoteric shit. fighting is pat's zen
[4:59:35] <majindusto> 15 YEARS
[4:59:36] <hntronium> SnapShotKing
[4:59:38] <Worldbrand> pat's anger burnt out like the first flame, it only comes back when a videogame is kindled to link it
[4:59:39] <dsauce999> Don't try and make chat look nice SwitfRage
[4:59:39] <%ElenaManetta> But now he has the world + Elmo
[4:59:40] <%Cogito1001> So youre me now
[4:59:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> angaray
[4:59:45] <%JustSayAnything> How?
[4:59:47] <KiraKamixephos> Grumpy pat
[4:59:47] <sileo_patronus> Was that when you were toxic as shit?
[4:59:47] <%ssjklyco> He is now PassiveAggressive Pat
[4:59:48] <Finakala> BBCTB was just a bad game and nobody bought into it
[4:59:48] <waifoong98> Play Melty Blood Pat, it is real fun
[4:59:48] <CaramelTaffy> I am just depressed instead of angry
[4:59:49] <Cobaltor_252> ya now he has a job...wait
[4:59:49] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 5 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 20oz (600mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:59:50] <%Paralurx> I wish I could turn it around
[4:59:50] <ventus_fury> Thank you for the match Pat.
[4:59:50] <%Skeletorexplains> what part?
[4:59:52] <waifoong98> and easy too
[4:59:53] <%shivhappy22> then you gotta chuuuuug!
[4:59:54] <%ElenaManetta> Pat's angry life just flashed before his eyes
[4:59:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> And then that anger made STRONGER than ever before!
[4:59:55] <%JJCheeker> you were 17?
[4:59:56] <wolf_hurricane> it's incredible
[4:59:56] <Sofa_King_Hype> don't let it set in!
[4:59:57] <sponsoredviewer910> LUL turned it around and became an influencer
[4:59:58] <KasGiD> I remember seeing you on Machinima back when I was in Elementary school. Now i'm 21
[5:00:01] <V1irtuousrabbit> People begging pat to play there shitty games lul
[5:00:02] <person181> i was but a wee lad back then
[5:00:06] <wolf_hurricane> that MvCI managed to be a better game than CrossTag
[5:00:07] <Pookiedaexzile> He turned it all around...by turning his hate into Food
[5:00:08] <wolf_hurricane> it blows my mind
[5:00:10] <KiraKamixephos> Where’s the dimension where you’re GrumpiestPat
[5:00:14] <%Keyd00d> Now you single handedly saved the Yakuza series in the west
[5:00:21] <%JJCheeker> 2004
[5:00:22] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> The 2nd decade of the 2000's is ending
[5:00:24] <Run44forrest> LVL 1 AngryPat --> LVL 50 Boss Thats how Zaibatsu Work
[5:00:25] <%vaporousTippler> And created Warframe.
[5:00:27] <+seaearthandsky> @Finakala theres a lot of people who play bbtag
[5:00:29] <%Cogito1001> Change your name to Chillest Pat
[5:00:31] <%ElenaManetta> And Metal Wolf!
[5:00:33] <+Jordan_z123> 3
[5:00:34] <wolf_hurricane> what's a Zaibatsu?
[5:00:34] <waifoong98> You know Tag is shite when even the BB character doesn't have a DRIVE BUTTON.
[5:00:34] <%SvenHolgersson> Patkuza
[5:00:36] <dsauce999> Why feel hate when you could have redbull sponsorships instead
[5:00:37] <ShichiNoBushi> His trick is that he's angry all the time.
[5:00:38] <sileo_patronus> He also created warframe
[5:00:42] <wolf_hurricane> the Zaibatsu is as dead as MvC
[5:00:43] <%TheShal> Where are there flying cares AND Wheeled cars in the Dragonball version of Earth?
[5:00:53] <Chumblago13> yikes
[5:00:55] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat Use that 6H, baby
[5:00:56] <%Toynota10> wtf
[5:00:58] <%TheShal> Why do Flying Cars use roads?
[5:00:58] <%TheStarbecue> ooooh the canadian resets
[5:00:59] <person181> classesum
[5:01:02] <$TC_Lagann> Creator of Warframe, Savior of Yakuza, memer of bees and master of cubes. Hows that for a channel description?
[5:01:03] <Mattmandx1> @wolf_hurricane MVCI is actually a good fighting game if just looking at its core mechanics, it just looked bad and had an underwhelming roster. Real shame since the combat was fun
[5:01:07] <%SvenHolgersson> Cuz not everyone can afford the flying cars
[5:01:09] <%Keyd00d> poor people
[5:01:10] <Bluewind098> Why does it feel like fighting game players like to shit talk other fighting games than play their own games?
[5:01:11] <CaramelTaffy> Bulma
[5:01:12] <hntronium> Capsule Corp
[5:01:13] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat lmao mmmm i met disrespectful 16s tht did his neutral heavy at round start. just press circle and tap assist. idea is to make tht move safe so they dnt mash ifffff they block the attk.
[5:01:14] <ShichiNoBushi> Because it's future fantasy land.
[5:01:15] <%Cogito1001> Cause flying cars are expensicve
[5:01:17] <wolf_hurricane> @Mattmandx1 I have 200 hours in it, I know
[5:01:19] <%Skeletorexplains> Easier to animate flying ships
[5:01:19] <%SvenHolgersson> City people have em but farmers still got normal cars
[5:01:21] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat Cooler's divekicks are also pretty safe on block
[5:01:21] <Ion_LaserX> Cause poor people can only afford wheeled cars
[5:01:23] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> flying cars are newer technology probably
[5:01:23] <%ElenaManetta> Zaibatsu also made several other artists and indie people power.
[5:01:24] <%Toynota10> @Fuggins4U Cuz Bulma's family is rich as fuck!
[5:01:25] <+KaiserCrimson_1> I didn't care about BBTag until Akihiko got in the game, but they ruined Kanji so...
[5:01:25] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @TheShal The proletariat
[5:01:26] <%ElenaManetta> They are raw power
[5:01:27] <+phatmac16> Capsule corp
[5:01:28] <+paladinstarbuster> to condense traffic
[5:01:30] <%SvenHolgersson> The economy of DBZ is a NIGHTMARE
[5:01:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Why are there dog people and dogs in DBZ
[5:01:30] <%ssjklyco> Remember when Krillen was reading a USA Today?
[5:01:33] <%Gatzarlok> Why are there Gas cars and electric cars today?
[5:01:34] <Run44forrest> whats canadian reset? is it pity
[5:01:36] <wolf_hurricane> Zero/Jedah/Space for life bro
[5:01:36] <%TheStarbecue> he tried
[5:01:38] <majindusto> The Zaibatsu will never Truly die!
[5:01:39] <+seaearthandsky> @Bluewind098 because thats extremely accurate
[5:01:39] <%Paralurx> WHIFF: PUNISHED
[5:01:39] <+Kaito_Cam> Hey man not everyone can afford their own set of wheels
[5:01:41] <+Jordan_z123> bait
[5:01:41] <%Toynota10> Capsule corps kinda owns everything lol
[5:01:42] <%Cogito1001> Not everyone can afford flying cars fuggins

[5:01:42] <Chumblago13> the bait
[5:01:43] <sponsoredviewer910> he switched side at home
[5:01:50] <ShichiNoBushi> If there are dog people, are there still pet dogs, too?
[5:01:56] <%Keyd00d> Yes
[5:01:56] <%ElenaManetta> What was the Tier thing Best Friends promoted and it got big? Like, Zoo Tier lists or something.
[5:01:58] <ventus_fury> "This guy is so much better" lol I know I'm bad but ouch :D
[5:02:01] <%Keyd00d> Buu and Satan own a dog
[5:02:04] <Mattmandx1> Blazblue Vs. Guilty Gear is the game that people actually wanted but we got blueballed on that
[5:02:07] <hntronium> Good Job getting gud aubreon
[5:02:08] <$TC_Lagann> when will Dogperson get confirmed for the roster?
[5:02:08] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat Use the Self detonate, I dare you
[5:02:11] <wolf_hurricane> furries are the minorities of the DB world
[5:02:13] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> @ShichiNoBushi its a goofy pluto situation
[5:02:13] <ShichiNoBushi> Forgot about Buu's dog.
[5:02:15] <%TheStarbecue> RAH RAH Pat RAH RAH Pat
[5:02:15] <NumberTooBig> @ElenaManetta TierZoo
[5:02:16] <%ssjklyco> when is smash?
[5:02:17] <wolf_hurricane> and triclopses are the retards LUL
[5:02:18] <+Kaito_Cam> Ohhh boy the he
[5:02:23] <+Kaito_Cam> He sat up
[5:02:23] <ventus_fury> Buu's Dog Bee?
[5:02:24] <%ElenaManetta> Yeahhh that
[5:02:25] <Bluewind098> @seaearthandsky you seem like you know Cross Tag a bit. Where do people play that game? PS4, PC, Switch? Kind of want to play it again
[5:02:26] <Millia_Sparkle> good spent on meter
[5:02:26] <Chumblago13> Goofy and PLuto
[5:02:27] <%SvenHolgersson> The mayor of this city is a dog person
[5:02:28] <%Paralurx> a dog is King of Earth
[5:02:29] <%NWR_James> Do dog people have pet humans?
[5:02:30] <+paladinstarbuster> prsident dawg
[5:02:31] <Run44forrest> There may be no Patriarch but we are still Big Zaibatsu chat never forget that
[5:02:31] <+Kaito_Cam> that's how you know it's a real match
[5:02:31] <umm_idunno> its like humans and monkeys
[5:02:32] <%Skeletorexplains> @Fuggins4U Maybe its just their Fetish? You donno.
[5:02:36] <+Shastafield> like goofy?
[5:02:37] <NumberTooBig> also those dog people in DBZ are classified as funny animals
[5:02:38] <ArtThouBored> Shu from Dragon Ball
[5:02:38] <+KaiserCrimson_1> President of the Earth is a dog man
[5:02:42] <%TheStarbecue> Do Buu and Hercule sex?
[5:02:42] <+arfafax> President Furry Wowee
[5:02:43] <%Keyd00d> Buubee
[5:02:44] <%3xgilly> Pat you can always and absolutely assist into a level 3
[5:02:49] <%ElenaManetta> Are people in chat who are playing Pat using the same names? I've been trying to keep an eye out for players shit talking Pat
[5:02:58] <%Toynota10> @AngriestPat Ever wanna get in some KOF13?
[5:03:00] <DeanX27> Buubee, now that's lore right there.
[5:03:01] <$TC_Lagann> Dammit Fuggins, 20 years... 20 years and i never put that together
[5:03:02] <%Keyd00d> In Dragon Ball Online Buu creates a female Majin called Buubi
[5:03:02] <wolf_hurricane> yo does anyone want some free wins in PC DBFZ
[5:03:03] <%SvenHolgersson> Bibitti Babidi Buu Bee
[5:03:04] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@TheShal) (warning)
[5:03:04] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat DHC into level 3
[5:03:05] <ventus_fury> I'm using the same name last match
[5:03:07] <Mattmandx1> Dog people are just evolved dogs just like how humans are evolved apes
[5:03:12] <%SvenHolgersson> Toriyama loves shitty puns
[5:03:14] <+TheHeroAppears> Light it up?
[5:03:15] <wizchiefa23> I’ll rid this world of saiyans
[5:03:15] <ShichiNoBushi> It was a failure calling the fusion of Buu and Uub "Majuub".
[5:03:17] <+seaearthandsky> @Bluewind098 ps4 is the primary place for basically every arcsys game and i have no idea what the player base is like for switch
[5:03:21] <gottigotbundles> nah my name is BussAss in the game
[5:03:25] <%DedlokPM> @TheShal because they are hover cars.
[5:03:29] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat Input the quarter circle back command and press assist
[5:03:31] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Where's Uub in Super
[5:03:32] <%TheStarbecue> hold back when you DHC
[5:03:38] <person181> man i want UUB in this
[5:03:41] <majindusto> Shu of the Pilaf Gang is a humanoid Dog
[5:03:42] <KiraKamixephos> I’m guessing the switch player base is a lag fest
[5:03:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Toriyama named his series Dragonball and then named the sequal Dragonballs
[5:03:45] <%Keyd00d> Uub is a tiny baby in Super
[5:03:47] <DeanX27> @Sphincter_Spelunker In his village, he's like 5 years old.
[5:03:56] <%ElenaManetta> I don't like 16's "Try Harder" line. Just a LITTLE TOO CLOSE TO "Try Hard"
[5:03:59] <person181> bring the baby to fight
[5:04:00] <%3xgilly> Just something to consider
[5:04:05] <%Cogito1001> Just use kid buu's alt skin you know the one.
[5:04:10] <%ssjklyco> I just remembered Master Roshi inadvertantley killed the Rabbit Goku put on the moon when he blew up the moon.
[5:04:11] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat Can only go 1-1-3
[5:04:14] <Chumblago13> raw level 3s
[5:04:16] <+Jordan_z123> 4
[5:04:21] <%SvenHolgersson> You can level 1 into a level 3 switch
[5:04:22] <%3xgilly> you can only assist into a level 3 from a level 1
[5:04:23] <Run44forrest> comboing into assist lvl3 is pretty useless imo then again i never got the hang of it
[5:04:26] <doodledumps> Hey Fuggins do you play a lot of fighting games? If so are you as battle crazy as Pat and Wools?
[5:04:27] <ShichiNoBushi> We have Teen Gohan and Gotenks. Why not babby Uub?
[5:04:32] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat The games moment to moment. its all depends what you want to do. If you hit 18 and do a super would you dhc again to get her close to death, or keep your best character to fighter her neutral.
[5:04:39] <%ElenaManetta> I really like it when someone uses a big super and it makes the entire living room light up.
[5:04:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Look at pat flexing his baby fingies
[5:04:41] <person181> yes why not
[5:04:49] <Bluewind098> I remember trying out Cross Tag's beta on Switch at first and it was fine
[5:04:49] <majindusto> Uub is the Worst
[5:04:55] <zami916> if you hold back when you dhc it will do a lvl 3. you can also perform a "z change" by doing half circle forward for lvl 1 or half circle back for lvl 3
[5:04:56] <Pookiedaexzile> No Pat not the mirror match
[5:05:00] <V1irtuousrabbit> 18s neutral is also hot garbage
[5:05:02] <Mattmandx1> @Run44forrest It's to do enough damage to kill while also safely tagging someone else in
[5:05:03] <DeanX27> Gohan was 5 too in the saiyan saga
[5:05:04] <Worldbrand> the only competitive game i ever got good at was meteos
[5:05:04] <%Cogito1001> Doesnt stop pat
[5:05:05] <dsauce999> Patcifist?
[5:05:05] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> @ElenaManetta yeah it looks like explosives are going off
[5:05:07] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Pookiedaexzile) (warning)
[5:05:11] <%ElenaManetta> Can't fighting games just be for fun against NPCs. It doesn't have to be competitive apatJpeg
[5:05:13] <NumberTooBig> @AngriestPat so ... thinking of showing fuggins the glory of frenchbread before woolz does
[5:05:16] <wolf_hurricane> yes there is
[5:05:16] <Millia_Sparkle> @V1irtuousrabbit its utter trash shes hopeless
[5:05:18] <Sofa_King_Hype> @Run44forrest Unless they changed it, 3 level 1s are better damage than a 1 to 3 or 1-1-3 because of scaling
[5:05:18] <person181> uub has done nothing so he deserves a chance
[5:05:21] <wolf_hurricane> there is 100% a Switch fighstick you idiot
[5:05:22] <Bluewind098> Funnily enough playing Cross Tag on Switch Wi fi was better than Dragonball on PS4 wired in my experience
[5:05:24] <+paladinstarbuster> nothin wrong with pad
[5:05:27] <%TheStarbecue> @AngriestPat use QCB button as cooler for his DP during gaps in blockstring or to catch em sleeping
[5:05:28] <+KaiserCrimson_1> There's tons of sticks for Switch
[5:05:28] <$TC_Lagann> glorious bread of the french
[5:05:29] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat Good job, buddy
[5:05:33] <%yeknomlive> i got a brook's converter
[5:05:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Ubb had a villiage and mohawk what more do you want son
[5:05:34] <%Hilleltaco> Switch fightsticks have been made
[5:05:37] <Finakala> Fighting games are best fun when you have a housemate who also plays the same games, so much chill time
[5:05:40] <Chumblago13> big numbers
[5:05:42] <%SvenHolgersson> Broly and 16 are damned good
[5:05:44] <+seaearthandsky> @wolf_hurricane alright, chill out
[5:05:44] <hntronium> MAXIMUM
[5:05:46] <majindusto> Uub is literally a nothing character
[5:05:47] <+Shastafield> hand me that single joycon i'll fuck it up
[5:05:49] <%Skeletorexplains> at least 5
[5:05:50] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat Pop sparking, save your beefy boy
[5:05:58] <+KaiserCrimson_1> Plus there were converters before it even got released
[5:05:58] <%ElenaManetta> They can't say bastard in a children's fighting game...
[5:05:59] <Worldbrand> his power level has transcended numbers. it is now a real-world concept. his power level is approximately milk
[5:06:01] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Uub is more of a character than Jiren
[5:06:04] <%TheStarbecue> SPARK
[5:06:07] <+Kaito_Cam> it's not power level anymore it's Battle Power
[5:06:10] <%TheStarbecue> nice
[5:06:16] <Sofa_King_Hype> @Hilleltaco There's a switch controller adapter so you can use any fightstick on switch
[5:06:18] <%TheStarbecue> oh on
[5:06:20] <%TheStarbecue> no
[5:06:21] <ShichiNoBushi> We still have yet to get the scene of Goku training Uub and ruining Kami's Lookout. And then Pilaf makes a wish on the Black Star Dragonballs to make Goku a kid again...
[5:06:21] <%SvenHolgersson> Uub is fine
[5:06:21] <Bluewind098> Probbably because of my router. My router has been shitting the bed alot. I noticed it when I started having alot of laggy games on Overwatch
[5:06:21] <wolf_hurricane> LUL
[5:06:21] <ventus_fury> Good job
[5:06:24] <majindusto> Is he?
[5:06:25] <V1irtuousrabbit> Sparking is invincible startup
[5:06:27] <Mattmandx1> Level 3's got damage buffed in the recent patch while DHC supers were nerfed overall
[5:06:29] <Run44forrest> @Mattmandx1 i get that but its so situational and i cant get it to come out in a match 8 time out of 10
[5:06:30] <%TheStarbecue> milk is good
[5:06:32] <NumberTooBig> switch sticks are either the generics, Hayabusa V, or the Hori d pad,
[5:06:32] <Chumblago13> thought it was red bull
[5:06:33] <$TC_Lagann> milk LUL
[5:06:35] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat Sparking is you. Do you wanna save it for your last character (sparking lasts longest) or early to make sure you kill a problem
[5:06:36] <%MANDRAGORAROOT> number one! :)
[5:06:37] <OwlLightningMage> Milk sucks
[5:06:39] <%TheStarbecue> it makes you grow tall
[5:06:40] <%Cogito1001> Switch Fightstick = 3 switches ductaped together
[5:06:42] <wolf_hurricane> wE ARE NUMBER ONE!
[5:06:42] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat You got this
[5:06:43] <%Skeletorexplains> what kind of milk?
[5:06:44] <person181> yah but we don't talk about GT
[5:06:44] <hntronium> Milk isn't for strong bones
[5:06:45] <%ElenaManetta> Pat has a grudge against milk because it never made him taller.
[5:06:45] <%Skeletorexplains> Roach Milk?
[5:06:47] <%Keyd00d> I'd like to see Uub eventually do things in canon
[5:06:49] <DeanX27> Vegeta is so happy when he says he's number 1
[5:06:51] <wolf_hurricane> step into the grand tour
[5:06:53] <ArtThouBored> Pfffffft sure Vegeta
[5:06:54] <jaguarkek318> who's team large lads?
[5:06:55] <DracaenaLeaf> Just one more game, one more game
[5:06:55] <wolf_hurricane> gRAND TOUR gRAND TOUR
[5:06:58] <$TC_Lagann> "oatmilk pat"
[5:06:58] <cool_culainn> What was the password for the lobby?
[5:07:00] <Bluewind098> I know people say to play on wired but I've had better connections on my Switch 5G wifi for every game. I even tried wired for Mario Tennis and had worse games
[5:07:00] <person181> fucking same key
[5:07:04] <%ElenaManetta> 1212 or 1112
[5:07:08] <gottigotbundles> around my friend just signed me out...
[5:07:08] <person181> 1112
[5:07:09] <NumberTooBig> 1221
[5:07:09] <%ElenaManetta> I forgot which was the lie
[5:07:10] <ShichiNoBushi> There are bugs you can milk. Ants raise them for that purpose.
[5:07:10] <Millia_Sparkle> pat with balls in the corner
[5:07:10] <wolf_hurricane> 1488 Kappa
[5:07:13] <Millia_Sparkle> like a true 16
[5:07:17] <gottigotbundles> and*
[5:07:18] <BillieNoMates> Wow. Woolie sure looks different Kappa
[5:07:18] <Worldbrand> 0451
[5:07:19] <Millia_Sparkle> yuupppppppp
[5:07:21] <cool_culainn> Thanks
[5:07:21] <FruitBasketVidya> 1112
[5:07:24] <Mattmandx1> @Run44forrest Just hold back while pressing the assist button while DHCing. Some characters don't have good synergy so it'll whiff though
[5:07:25] <majindusto> Because Jiren despite everything actually does stuf in the franchise...Unlike Uub
[5:07:25] <wolf_hurricane> @Worldbrand my nigga
[5:07:27] <NumberTooBig> 4201
[5:07:36] <ShichiNoBushi> "12345"
[5:07:36] <kingdudeby> The announcer reminds of of the cartoon network fighting game.
[5:07:37] <+seaearthandsky> @Bluewind098 main reason for wired vs wifi is the connection tends to be more stable overall
[5:07:38] <person181> uub never got a chance
[5:07:39] <Pookiedaexzile> 1112 and then down 4
[5:07:44] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat Bar helps too
[5:07:46] <V1irtuousrabbit> 5 dudes blowing 10 dudes?
[5:07:47] <%ElenaManetta> When I steal Pat's credit card, my first guess will definitely be 1112
[5:07:48] <%SvenHolgersson> LUL
[5:07:50] <%TheStarbecue> Maybe if Pat had ever drank his milk, he would be taller shofuFacts
[5:07:52] <Chumblago13> Wasnt Jiren's backstory just he got beat by a strong person and it ruined it life.
[5:08:01] <Worldbrand> what's elmo on a keypad? it's probably that
[5:08:01] <%TheShal> Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right 111
[5:08:01] <cool_culainn> Yup
[5:08:02] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat I've always just done motion though, it's easy enough to do, timing is super generous
[5:08:09] <hntronium> Nah, if Pat drank a lot of milk, he'd have weak hips
[5:08:10] <Chumblago13> or he is just the biggest sore loser ever?
[5:08:11] <ventus_fury> woolieYE woolieYe I see this being flipped
[5:08:12] <enoughmold> Hello
[5:08:12] <%SvenHolgersson> He drank a fuckload of milk genetics told him to fuck off
[5:08:14] <%Toynota10> He's drank so much milk you guys
[5:08:19] <ShichiNoBushi> We all know that Twitch automatically censors it whenever you say your password, credit card, or other sensitive information.
[5:08:21] <%Cogito1001> @Chumblago13 That sounds as boring as his design
[5:08:21] <Pookiedaexzile> try down 3
[5:08:28] <+seaearthandsky> pat did drink a shit ton of milk LUL
[5:08:29] <%Toynota10> He coulda died if he hadn't stopped lol
[5:08:30] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Bluewind098 Having a decent connection on your end doesn't necessarily mean its good on your opponent's end
[5:08:35] <%Gatzarlok> Will pat choke away another victory?
[5:08:36] <%SvenHolgersson> You don;t have greedy characters
[5:08:36] <%ElenaManetta> Did I daydream that Pat and Fuggins got pizza? I think my brain is frying from watching all these special effects for five hours...
[5:08:41] <NumberTooBig> the code is 8888 2222 4646 R1 Kappa
[5:08:48] <Chumblago13> @Cogito1001 I know his primary motivation was even more boring
[5:08:52] <$TC_Lagann> Cheese is good for you aggain, but only for the next 12 minutes
[5:08:53] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat YOU DID THE THING!!!
[5:08:53] <Millia_Sparkle> noooooooo
[5:08:54] <KiraKamixephos> @angriestpat use your assist to cover yourself when your moves get blocked
[5:08:57] <%TheStarbecue> I need receipts for all this supposed "Drank Milk"
[5:08:57] <OwlLightningMage> Pat is forever greedy for red bull
[5:08:58] <%CaptainPileDriver> has to be quick
[5:08:58] <Millia_Sparkle> tht looked legit
[5:08:59] <Sofa_King_Hype> @TheStarbecue In the last podcast, he said he drank milk and it didn't work. Now he can't drink anything more than 1% because of meds.
[5:09:00] <dsauce999> @AngriestPat Just follow your heart and raw super whenever possible
[5:09:05] <Run44forrest> @Mattmandx1 no i mean going straight into lvl 3 assist by doing half circle backwards assist after a combo
[5:09:08] <Millia_Sparkle> nice anti air
[5:09:13] <%CaptainPileDriver> NICE
[5:09:15] <%3xgilly> YAAAAYYY good job pat!!!! that took me forever to get down
[5:09:15] <Millia_Sparkle> tht was realllly good
[5:09:15] <Worldbrand> oh my god
[5:09:19] <majindusto> Milk is now bad you guys...Stop liking Milk
[5:09:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> broly's
[5:09:21] <%Cogito1001> @Chumblago13 I wonder if he was made as basic as possible as a joke.
[5:09:21] <%TheStarbecue> WHeRE ARE THE RECEIPTS
[5:09:24] <Millia_Sparkle> not being nice to be nice tht good job
[5:09:32] <Aubreon> GG @angriestpat you are my childhood hero
[5:09:32] <+seaearthandsky> @TheStarbecue look up the childhood kumite highlight on woolie vs LUL
[5:09:32] <cool_culainn> But I like milk
[5:09:35] <Mattmandx1> @Chumblago13 In the manga Jiren's master was killed by a demon which resulted in his soul to be tormented so Jiren decided to get strong to prevent that from happening again and wanted to wish his master back to life with the Super DB's. It kinda parallels Goku after the events of the King Piccolo saga
[5:09:36] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat Cooler's are weird because they're cinematic supers, you gotta wait just a bit more
[5:09:37] <Griffithdid9elleven> Kappa
[5:09:42] <%ElenaManetta> But now logic deems you will get worse because you're playing TOO long
[5:09:42] <+alexth3gr3at> Cooler's could work if you're mid air and time it right
[5:09:44] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> oh yeah ace combat 7 is out now on pc
[5:09:45] <%FrostMass22> Remember when Woolie went on that bizarre anti-milk rant?
[5:09:45] <Run44forrest> Lactose Intolerant Gang
[5:09:46] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Practice = getting good? wuuuuuuuuut
[5:09:47] <$TC_Lagann> "im not a fckn scrub"
[5:09:47] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> mhm
[5:09:48] <%ElenaManetta> Or whatever that "rule of practice" is
[5:09:48] <Chumblago13> @Cogito1001 Honestly I wouldnt be surprised.
[5:09:51] <waifoong98> Play Melt Blood Pat, you can pool of some really disgusting shit easily LUL
[5:09:52] <%ssjklyco> Clemps can now beat Pat
[5:09:53] <%Keyd00d> Weirdly Jiren was going to be more interesting before Toriyama said he should be a quiet stoic guy
[5:09:54] <ShichiNoBushi> I've been drinking plenty of... "malk"?
[5:09:55] <%TheStarbecue> guys, i know about the milk, im just trying to chide
[5:09:56] <waifoong98> *pull
[5:09:56] <majindusto> PLAY IT MORE
[5:09:57] <OwlLightningMage> You don't play them. stop lying LUL
[5:10:01] <ventus_fury> Captain again?
[5:10:01] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat I combo his ground supers all the time
[5:10:05] <sileo_patronus> You're doing very well for a disabled man new to fighting games :)
[5:10:12] <waifoong98> @sileo_patronus LUL
[5:10:13] <lozscat> Sure you’re not a scrub pat
[5:10:16] <DeanX27> @Keyd00d Are there any early Jiren concepts online?
[5:10:17] <Chumblago13> @Mattmandx1 oh wow
[5:10:20] <%TheStarbecue> Cooler's LVL 3 does work, its a different version @AngriestPat
[5:10:21] <$TC_Lagann> Poor Fuggins, he only wanted to compliment his buddy
[5:10:26] <KiraKamixephos> is re2 a fighting game
[5:10:26] <+KaiserCrimson_1> Pat looks like he could play a Kouma Kishima tbh
[5:10:28] <Run44forrest> howd that heavy hit
[5:10:31] <DrkJP520> Would be neat if other players got to play
[5:10:32] <%TheStarbecue> trust us daddy
[5:10:35] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat Yeah, Lythero DHC's into 16's level 3 all the time
[5:10:39] <%DedlokPM> oh god. that jiren color scheme is hideous
[5:10:39] <Millia_Sparkle> ho ho ho pats persona is 16
[5:10:42] <+alexth3gr3at> Cooler's Lvl 3 is different when it's used on the ground and in air
[5:10:47] <%ElenaManetta> @TC_Lagann HahahHAHA THAT'S TRUE. FUGGINS WAS TRYiNG TO BE NICE and got shot down. Poor guy.
[5:10:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Give the ol Nut twist
[5:10:47] <+seaearthandsky> @DrkJP520 welcome to dragon ball
[5:10:49] <Mattmandx1> @Chumblago13 Yeah the anime version isn't nearly as compelling from what i've heard
[5:10:54] <%ElenaManetta> He deserves better BFFs than Pat. Like Chat.
[5:10:57] <+Heroes_of_Vale> Wait, so Jiren's already out? Huh, thought it was going to be a few weeks.
[5:10:57] <@Fuggins4U> =(
[5:10:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Grab his nuts and Twist it
[5:10:59] <%DedlokPM> I thought jiren could not get worse
[5:11:01] <Sofa_King_Hype> I think cooler does the arial level 3 on DHD @AngriestPat
[5:11:06] <Millia_Sparkle> hooooooooo
[5:11:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Give em the ol Nut twist
[5:11:09] <Millia_Sparkle> recoooome
[5:11:10] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat When it's on the ground, Cooler's level 3 is a counter,in the air it's a grab, and it acts as the air version in DHCs
[5:11:12] <Run44forrest> jiren and videl came out on jan 31st
[5:11:19] <%3xgilly> YAY we are getting pat thinkin apatDab apatHoldon
[5:11:22] <Chumblago13> @Mattmandx1 I watched the anime version and it was so nothing that I had trouble remembering it.
[5:11:23] <%TheStarbecue> you gotta save enough bar tho
[5:11:27] <tralfamad0re> the names recoom it rhymes with doom and you're going to be hurting all too soon
[5:11:29] <braincraft> You don't double dunk, bro. That's like putting your whole android in the dip.
[5:11:36] <Millia_Sparkle> @3xgilly amen
[5:11:39] <%Toynota10> Ghost dick suck is strong
[5:11:40] <Cobaltor_252> is Pat wanting to play as Broly some form of compensation?
[5:11:45] <%ElenaManetta> The corners are your kryptonite
[5:11:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Ghost is getting it good tonight
[5:11:50] <ventus_fury> Broly down
[5:11:50] <Run44forrest> pat combos in this game are pretty loose once you get an idea of what works and what doesnt
[5:11:58] <Millia_Sparkle> 16??
[5:12:00] <%TheStarbecue> who the FUCK is 13?
[5:12:01] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat Try waiting a bit more, I'd recommend, just like a second more
[5:12:02] <+seaearthandsky> you mean 16?
[5:12:04] <wolf_hurricane> 13?
[5:12:06] <Millia_Sparkle> or cooler
[5:12:07] <%3xgilly> 16?
[5:12:10] <%Toynota10> Woo Tien! Do that Level 7 super!
[5:12:14] <Millia_Sparkle> someone say something lol
[5:12:15] <V1irtuousrabbit> oohmygod you stoners you know what he meant
[5:12:15] <%TheStarbecue> Pat is cheating on 16
[5:12:18] <V1irtuousrabbit> Just wait a bit
[5:12:19] <wolf_hurricane> @AngriestPat if you mean Cooler, his is a counter
[5:12:20] <Millia_Sparkle> nooooo thts his persona
[5:12:21] <Run44forrest> oof that fuzzy
[5:12:22] <+KaiserCrimson_1> First you put on your trucker hat obviously
[5:12:22] <KiraKamixephos> just do it and it’ll work
[5:12:32] <wolf_hurricane> MY TRUCKER HAT
[5:12:36] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat RAW LEVEL 3, let him run into you
[5:12:42] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> don't pick up the green herb
[5:12:50] <Millia_Sparkle> rage burst
[5:12:56] <Millia_Sparkle> raaage burrrst
[5:12:57] <Mattmandx1> Jiren can side switch whenever he wants, it's pretty useful
[5:12:58] <Millia_Sparkle> nooooooo
[5:13:01] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat YEAHH! 6h Baby, it breaks so many ankles
[5:13:04] <DeanX27> When in doubt, stomp
[5:13:05] <sileo_patronus> THE LOCKER PAT
[5:13:07] <Millia_Sparkle> hes okay
[5:13:09] <Chumblago13> nice

[5:13:11] <Run44forrest> YYEYEEYE
[5:13:12] <+seaearthandsky> ded
[5:13:15] <Millia_Sparkle> pats a ginger god
[5:13:17] <Sofa_King_Hype> Cooler's level 3 after they vanish is the perfect way to do it.
[5:13:20] <Pookiedaexzile> DEd
[5:13:21] <+noajenkk> yea
[5:13:21] <%TheStarbecue> you can do it
[5:13:21] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat No! 5H
[5:13:22] <%Cogito1001> F
[5:13:23] <+noajenkk> 6h is a really good low
[5:13:23] <Pookiedaexzile> bad pat
[5:13:25] <Pookiedaexzile> now you die
[5:13:28] <Millia_Sparkle> i heard ankles. someones real here
[5:13:29] <+lethallunacyx> h3
[5:13:30] <%Demon_Shadow4> I like how non of these fights are kanon and most of these fights would last a nano second
[5:13:30] <%Cogito1001> OOO
[5:13:34] <Worldbrand> show feepis
[5:13:35] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat 5H into the wall
[5:13:39] <hntronium> Much closer than your last match with this guy
[5:13:39] <%Cogito1001> Awww
[5:13:39] <Chumblago13> @Ninja_Cat__ hello
[5:13:39] <Mattmandx1> Always 5H with Cooler, his 2H is slow as shit
[5:13:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Told ya
[5:13:42] <%TheStarbecue> ahhh darn
[5:13:42] <%ElenaManetta> I just noticed the top says Delay: #R. What is that
[5:13:43] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat Try it, it's better than sex
[5:13:46] <+seaearthandsky> he tried it again LUL
[5:13:46] <+noajenkk> someone leave so i can play :(
[5:13:46] <wizchiefa23> So how does it feel?
[5:13:47] <hntronium> You did good Pat
[5:13:49] <%Typhaeon> Numpad notation is garbage, don't at me
[5:13:57] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Frame delay
[5:14:01] <%Cogito1001> Its frame delay i thunkl
[5:14:03] <DrkJP520> fugginz, help. nobody else gets to play
[5:14:04] <%ElenaManetta> Oohhh
[5:14:04] <Millia_Sparkle> numpad notation is actually the way
[5:14:07] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat Cooler's 2H is only really good as a counter to Super Dashes, 5H is the way to go
[5:14:09] <Pookiedaexzile> If you tell Pat hes doing good he wont finish...ask paige
[5:14:12] <Millia_Sparkle> literally commentators say it
[5:14:19] <$TC_Lagann> that color pallette on Jiren is upsetting and i dont know why
[5:14:23] <%TehPryceIsRight> I finally made it into the lobby after like 3 hours lol
[5:14:27] <%ssjklyco> Is Jiren a hard counter against Hit?
[5:14:28] <apexvash> 6H then immediately hit 5H delaying will miss
[5:14:34] <Millia_Sparkle> @TehPryceIsRight GET IN THERE
[5:14:34] <%ElenaManetta> I imagine the queue is MASSIVE
[5:14:36] <hntronium> Some people are hogging fights
[5:14:37] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> You're playing the same people again and again
[5:14:42] <%3xgilly> something for nexxt stream
[5:14:44] <flattopswag> Not everyone's leaving after their game, which isn't helping
[5:14:45] <%ElenaManetta> There are 1200 people watching
[5:14:46] <+ssulcer> you cant hit rematch
[5:14:46] <%Typhaeon> We use computer number pads & phone number pads. Both have completely different top and bottom row placements. "Down" always means "down".
[5:14:46] <%Cogito1001> Exit lobby make a another
[5:14:51] <Mattmandx1> You could close this lobby and make a new one
[5:14:53] <Run44forrest> Pat do party match so you can see other peoples tech
[5:14:55] <KiraKamixephos> You already played this dude before
[5:14:57] <%Trinity5> how is pat still playing lmao
[5:14:57] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@TehPryceIsRight) (warning)
[5:15:01] <%Trinity5> let fuggins go hone
[5:15:03] <+KaiserCrimson_1> Numpad notation is great. Everyone's seen a keyboard before after all
[5:15:06] <Rikui_> the lobby is only 6 instead of 8 so yays longer waiting

[5:16:11] <HanPaul> Fuggins is back Kreyasm
[5:16:13] <CatsEyeBlind> Fuggins blink twice if Elmo is threatening you with a gun
[5:16:14] <%JJCheeker> mcdonalds woo
[5:16:18] <+seaearthandsky> this guy is just mashing auto combo
[5:16:20] <ShichiNoBushi> You wake up one morning, and Paige has a burger head like Mayor McCheese.
[5:16:26] <%ElenaManetta> McDonalds is like Chinese Food. IT doesn't fill you up for very long.
[5:16:34] <Pookiedaexzile> Welp
[5:16:34] <Valdorick> "McDonalds, I need more McDonalds." "YOU NEED MORE!?" "Foolishness, Honey, Foolishness."

[5:16:34] <$SirG005E> paige do you still get a toy
[5:16:37] <Worldbrand> no one can save you from gunmo
[5:16:37] <thelonechris> Elmo
[5:16:38] <Pookiedaexzile> how will he lose this time
[5:16:43] <OwlLightningMage> Pat chokes down too much caffine won't stop horking down McDonalds LUL
[5:16:44] <$TC_Lagann> "I feed my Paige, She is becoming Powerful"

[5:17:02] <%DedlokPM> @Fuggins4U 🔫 apatBlep
[5:17:05] <Personified134> swapping there was the worst choice possible
[5:17:13] <%ElenaManetta> DO IT PAT
[5:17:14] <%Gatzarlok> Is it elmo with a gun or is it elmo's stand that has the gun?
[5:17:18] <%ssjklyco> I like to imagine that Elmo and Fuggins have a secret rivalry.
[5:17:19] <%Toynota10> LAME IT OUT!
[5:17:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> gg pa
[5:17:23] <eddie_hedgehog> can I play you pat
[5:17:23] <ThePoopinator9001> Broly's light autocombo is great. You can combo into it with his 214M in the corner. Can also do it off a vanish bounce, but the timing is a bit weird.
[5:17:23] <%ElenaManetta> NO!
[5:17:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat gg
[5:17:24] <+noajenkk> @AngriestPat not sure if you know, but if you start a combo with the second hit of light instead of the first, it scales like a medium would.
[5:17:25] <%SvenHolgersson> LUL
[5:17:27] <%ElenaManetta> I was rooting
[5:17:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Welp

[5:17:34] <%TheStarbecue> @AngriestPat Protip: a lot of players who dont know better will superdash after a blocked 5H or 2H. look out for it, easy punish.

[5:21:09] <+johnny_volcano> @AngriestPat After you get them in the air with cooler after 5h, use L-->M-->Ki-->QCB M
[5:21:11] <%TheStarbecue> @AngriestPat , dont forget Cooler's DP
[5:21:19] <+noajenkk> yea what johnny said
[5:21:24] <Polengoldur> i bet Pat could go 2 round with daigo
[5:21:25] <+noajenkk> qcb m is a great combo ender
[5:21:45] <DeanX27> "I'm not impressed. I'm also not impressive."

[5:22:03] <%Cogito1001> Well that setup probably makes it easier
[5:22:04] <+noajenkk> ki makes coolers shit connect
[5:22:05] <Valdorick> We might best know Vore as that thing the Sanic fandom enjoys in an unhealthy amount of, but what we forget, is that Buu was likely what awoke that within them.
[5:22:05] <%Keyd00d> Kreygasm

[5:22:43] <AntChodeny> I was never into vore until A21 came along.
[5:22:44] <solidoutlaw> qcb isn't 632
[5:22:44] <%Keyd00d> Maybe just cuz he's next to Broly
[5:22:45] <%Niney_Who> But Broly's strong is apatBig gerer
[5:22:47] <majindusto> He is tho
[5:22:47] <Chumblago13> Jiren number s huge, means he is stronger than time
[5:22:48] <solidoutlaw> it's 214
[5:22:49] <waifoong98> what a terrible 21 color DansGame
[5:22:49] <%ElenaManetta> If Pat's gonna play longer, maybe he should just do one match each so more people get the chance to play against him. Or not, I'm not his mother. apatWink

[5:31:20] <Captain_Aham> causes sliding knockdown in air
[5:31:20] <Run44forrest> pat thats super hard
[5:31:21] <+noajenkk> @AngriestPat when you end a combo in aerial dragon rush, it gives hard knockdown. this is new.
[5:31:22] <Valdorick> Because always be going in - Never back down./
[5:31:23] <umm_idunno> dr is a snapback
[5:31:23] <%TehPryceIsRight> DR does sliding now
[5:31:27] <%Paralurx> DR gets you a sliding knockdown
[5:31:29] <+noajenkk> it was just added in.
[5:31:29] <EnlightenedKramer> @run44forrest my boi!!
[5:31:33] <Rikui_> hard knockdown are ONLY with lvl 3
[5:31:35] <+AliveInside191> Not all characters can get sliding knockdown easily
[5:31:37] <+McDumDum> dr is the abriviation for dr mario
[5:31:37] <austinj24> Dr is slidin KD now Pat
[5:31:37] <person181> this videl looks like a child
[5:31:42] <+johnny_volcano> @angriestpat air DR leads to sliding knockdown now
[5:31:42] <V1irtuousrabbit> Because Broly doesn't get one easily but I was talking to the 21 player
[5:31:44] <KiraKamixephos> cuz it gives you knockdown now like the patch notes said
[5:31:45] <ShichiNoBushi> I've seen a lot of Videl players with good taste here lately.
[5:31:45] <%Cogito1001> yah pat aint winning this one

[5:32:10] <+noajenkk> you can set it up with assists, pat. @AngriestPat
[5:32:10] <+AliveInside191> Easiest way pat is to air combo into vanish, into DR
[5:32:11] <%ElenaManetta> Everyone raise your arms to give Patrick your energy
[5:32:13] <%ssjklyco> Don't read, Play
[5:32:19] <Rikui_> DR after Vanish

[5:33:07] <+noajenkk> meter is not items, pat. you dont need to save it for later. spend whatcha got @AngriestPat
[5:33:08] <%ssjklyco> Videl is the Ice Climbers of DBFighterz
[5:33:09] <%TheStarbecue> emlo booty detected
[5:33:13] <%ElenaManetta> Is uh, Pat looking at chat or looking at the game
[5:33:15] <%Cogito1001> Jesus

[5:33:19] <+McSoliace> you can get like 20 bars of meter in one match
[5:33:20] <Valdorick> Elmo is such a CamWhore

[5:33:32] <%AncelDeLambert> I think you've hit your mental limit, Pat
[5:33:32] <%Kazooki_Kazami> her mix ups are pretty good
[5:33:33] <%TheStarbecue> tell Elmo to strip
[5:33:34] <Ventuss> save meter for next match
[5:33:34] <KiraKamixephos> You gets tons of meter and it doesn’t all have to be for supers
[5:33:37] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@vegetassj9001) (warning)
[5:33:37] <TigerClaws12> he practically has 2 Bardocks LUL
[5:33:38] <Run44forrest> you have 7 bars pat
[5:33:39] <+KaiserCrimson_1> You gain about a whole bar just by moving around so it's not like you're starved for meter. Treat it like Third Strike
[5:33:39] <+AliveInside191> Pat your losing with 7 bars
[5:33:41] <jaguarkek318> true @angriestpat u should try using Dr after vanish to get a snapback and get a incoming set up
[5:33:45] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat noooo its all on you. Its situation and your calls
[5:33:48] <flattopswag> I mean, you did 0 damage with seven bars
[5:33:49] <austinj24> Fuck Videl is a blender
[5:33:51] <+noajenkk> you should spend it for when its most optimal. sometimes thats setting up for hard knockdown. its something that requires labbing. @AngriestPat
[5:33:53] <+McSoliace> set ups mean more damage later
[5:33:53] <+TheHeroAppears> meter doesn't do damage after you lose pat
[5:33:59] <+ssulcer> @AngriestPat it always does the most damage to raw lvl 3... so no you shouldnt save meter to only do that lol
[5:34:08] <%ssjklyco> That is elmos hat now

[5:34:51] <+onikuri> Whoop that Azz!!!!!
[5:34:52] <+McDumDum> why are all the cars priests
[5:35:03] <%TheStarbecue> you did it too slow
[5:35:04] <gottigotbundles> you did it too late
[5:35:07] <%ssjklyco> Mr Satan is the Lucky Ted of Dragon Ball Z
[5:35:07] <Rikui_> meter gain has been nerfed after doing a super, so just extend the combo with vanish instead, use meter 'only' to kill
[5:35:11] <%EyeRChris> apatWink doodBeamL doodBeam doodBeam apatWhat
[5:35:11] <eddie_hedgehog> lol that timing
[5:35:12] <cool_culainn> @plankman I don't think Jiren having a shotgun would do anything to improve his chances against the CHAMP
[5:35:17] <Valdorick> Centipat's dilemma
[5:35:18] <eddie_hedgehog> amazing
[5:35:20] <hntronium> But Pat, what if you need that meter for later.
[5:35:23] <%ElenaManetta> You're doing nice despite all these high class tips n tricks just aim for the win
[5:35:27] <ventus_fury> Bardock kill broly? Never
[5:35:27] <+Jordan_z123> 5
[5:35:28] <majindusto> HAIL SATAN
[5:35:28] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat i.e IF your team has good sync, is it for pressure in the corner or high corner carry combos? Guard cancel, vanish, ex moves all depends what problem you hve. problem as in tough character or spammed move.
[5:35:29] <MONKEYBALLSS2124> Fix the connection
[5:35:30] <%ElenaManetta> JUST WIN THE BOiViN WAY
[5:35:38] <eddie_hedgehog> u got this bro

[5:35:55] <%ElenaManetta> Almost six hours of DBFZ
[5:35:56] <%Cogito1001> mash your face against the stick
[5:35:57] <%TehPryceIsRight> @AngriestPat Do the Cooler 5S before ending the combo with the qcb+MM
[5:35:59] <%TheStarbecue> Moobot ur not helping
[5:36:07] <+onikuri> Broly vs Videl...What is DBZ
[5:36:08] <+McDumDum> hit the buttons on your controller to play the game
[5:36:09] <ThePoopinator9001> Can also go into Broly's autocombo if you land his 214M in the corner.
[5:36:09] <eddie_hedgehog> damn
[5:36:12] <Run44forrest> pat you should stream practice. We'd watch
[5:36:12] <%ElenaManetta> You didn't even play RE this long...
[5:36:13] <hntronium> Pat, your bot is racist against capital words
[5:36:14] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat is your team alive and you hve no meter. Or last character and youre rich with meter
[5:36:16] <%AncelDeLambert> damn, shade
[5:36:17] <InsomniacPersona> Is pat playing with viewers chat?
[5:36:18] <%EyeRChris> cheer500 They really should add Launch and give her crazy Gun-Kata combos.
[5:36:23] <Chumblago13> drink a healthy and empowering Redbull

[5:37:40] <+McDumDum> can't wait for mr rogers as dlc
[5:37:45] <+johnny_volcano> @angriestpat that's fine. I'm good to help whenever. just get me back on Twitter
[5:37:46] <Valdorick> Elmo is licking his sack live on stream. Demonitized.
[5:37:56] <Run44forrest> GO ELMO
[5:37:59] <gottigotbundles> @noajenkk sure I'll play after
[5:38:00] <%TehPryceIsRight> @AngriestPat I can show you with Cooler real quick if you really want.
[5:38:05] <%SvenHolgersson> During an assist
[5:38:06] <+noajenkk> nice, i'll be in the lobby waiting
[5:38:08] <Ion_LaserX> Is Pikkon going to be DLC?
[5:38:09] <+StellarSpiral> You can vanish after the command grab
[5:38:14] <+noajenkk> in fact i'll make a new ring when stream is over if anyone wants to join
[5:38:14] <eddie_hedgehog> vanish lol
[5:38:15] <Rikui_> vanish after comand grad to combo
[5:38:15] <+AliveInside191> Vanish after command grab for full combo
[5:38:22] <austinj24> Broly grab in corner
[5:38:24] <KiraKamixephos> you can combo after the medium one
[5:38:26] <OwlLightningMage> Elmo is flirting with Fuggins so hard LUL
[5:38:27] <%EyeRChris> Princess Trunks.....You dirty dirty boy
[5:38:28] <%TheStarbecue> command grab into super,simple stuff for now @AngriestPat
[5:38:33] <%FrostMass22> Maybe if he wins enough games, Red Bull will sponsor him
[5:38:37] <%ElenaManetta> Ignore the grabs GO FOR THE THROAT LAST CHARACTER
[5:38:37] <%SvenHolgersson> Broly is the BIGGEST corner bully
[5:38:39] <majindusto> Bojack must Return
[5:38:39] <+AliveInside191> Dash up and 5M
[5:38:43] <Run44forrest> @Ion_LaserX not confirmed. probably not. would be Cool though
[5:38:47] <DeanX27> It's the battle of Woolie's 2 favorite colors.
[5:38:53] <eddie_hedgehog> run and 5m
[5:38:56] <%TehPryceIsRight> @AngriestPat That depends on the character. It's not just a universal combo after vanish.
[5:38:56] <Millia_Sparkle> @AngriestPat probably pick it up with 2m. dash a little and eye ball it
[5:39:03] <eddie_hedgehog> or 2m
[5:39:04] <gottigotbundles> alright I got a broly Avi
[5:39:08] <Ion_LaserX> @Run44forrest His dub theme would be awesome for this game
[5:39:10] <+noajenkk> ahh almost had it
[5:39:15] <+KaiserCrimson_1> It's a timing thing
[5:39:17] <+noajenkk> your timing was too late @AngriestPat
[5:39:18] <Run44forrest> pat when they do raw super you can reflect and Run Up on Them
[5:39:22] <+noajenkk> you gotta buffer that input basically
[5:39:25] <InsomniacPersona> bad timing @AngriestPat
[5:39:25] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[5:39:25] <eddie_hedgehog> it's all about timing
[5:39:26] <%ssjklyco> They should announce Bojack on April Fools and have him be a model of Bojack Horseman
[5:39:28] <majindusto> Janemba too
[5:39:29] <%AncelDeLambert> total whiff
[5:39:30] <+Jordan_z123> Timing
[5:39:33] <Millia_Sparkle> @eddie_hedgehog thisssss
[5:39:34] <eddie_hedgehog> timing very important
[5:39:37] <%JJCheeker> well it's bedtime for me. goodnight Pat, Fuggins, Paige, Chat, and Elmo peepee apatPorgmo apatDab apatSkelmo
[5:39:38] <%ElenaManetta> Pat listening to chat for 25 minutes is making me anxious
[5:39:41] <Kaneis> You can buffer the input before hitting the ground
[5:39:42] <MementoExtasis> FUNgineer pat
[5:39:46] <+AliveInside191> You almost had it Pat, a little too late
[5:39:46] <+gogorobotz> Hello my favorite red head!
[5:39:47] <Chumblago13> delay doesnt help the timing either
[5:39:50] <%TheStarbecue> OOOOOOOH
[5:39:52] <+AliveInside191> But you had the right idea
[5:39:53] <%CaptainPileDriver> just go to bed and tomorrow or sunday we can lab with you
[5:39:53] <hntronium> HOW CAN THIS BE
[5:39:54] <%TheStarbecue> that was sick
[5:39:55] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Mustard?
[5:39:57] <Zereaux> pat needs more lab time
[5:39:58] <NumberTooBig> april fools should be Yajirobe, but he's just Johnny with senzu beans
[5:39:59] <+johnny_volcano> @angriestpat you're close
[5:40:05] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat tomorrow or sunday let's lab together with chat
[5:40:05] <austinj24> Yes
[5:40:05] <+scs83> neat, team red hot
[5:40:07] <+johnny_volcano> @angriestpat yeah
[5:40:08] <InsomniacPersona> yea instant you are on the ground
[5:40:17] <V1irtuousrabbit> He should pull a max and stream training mode
[5:40:19] <+gogorobotz> Yay!
[5:40:26] <eddie_hedgehog> just look at the animations
[5:40:39] <gottigotbundles> when's the next time you think you'll play this
[5:40:39] <majindusto> Cron- i mean Tapion as DLC
[5:40:43] <Millia_Sparkle> niccce
[5:40:46] <Run44forrest> pat stream training mode
[5:40:46] <%ElenaManetta> Vegeta is very attractive. Too bad he's a douche.
[5:40:48] <eddie_hedgehog> wait for ki to do damage and do the tag special
[5:40:53] <+noajenkk> @AngriestPat fun fact pat: you can do a 5H while landing after a combo with characters who aren't 16 to make doing your super input easier. so, landing 5H, then do the input. it's faster, but it's a LOT more consistent
[5:41:01] <Millia_Sparkle> blue tho
[5:41:02] <%TheStarbecue> as youre falling, hit H and buffer super out of that to help with timing @AngriestPat
[5:41:03] <DeanX27> He becomes less of a douche as time goes on though.
[5:41:03] <V1irtuousrabbit> @elenamanetta You are a degeneratea
[5:41:04] <Millia_Sparkle> so not real. but good

[5:53:01] <+TheHeroAppears> but pat
[5:53:04] <Millia_Sparkle> from arcys
[5:53:05] <%EyeRChris> @Superkbrown95 The game is solid. and the only thing you need to know about Dragonball is the Numbers go up and Broly's Number is MAXIMUM
[5:53:06] <V1irtuousrabbit> Some top players dont give a shit about dragon ball that play this game
[5:53:09] <%Keyd00d> ohhhhhhh
[5:53:09] <Valdorick> Elmo watches kobayashis dragon maid for the BIG PLOT. The big ol PLOT. The Yuge Plot
[5:53:13] <+gurrren_lagannn> best fighting game....
[5:53:16] <%Hilleltaco> @Superkbrown95 I've never watched Dragon Ball but this game's great
[5:53:16] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> there are not enough waifus in this to be there best
[5:53:17] <ventus_fury> Man I just unlocked SSGSS Goku off pat's matches and he kinda... feels lame
[5:53:21] <Chumblago13> Fuggins is great. 10/10 person.
[5:53:22] <%badmr7> take a pic of elmo you bastard
[5:53:26] <DeanX27> @ssjklyco So Elmo gets a new transformation every season?
[5:53:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> Arc System Works made an exclusive fighting game for a weird china-only console.
[5:53:28] <+zetaplus> a hard disagree, Guilty Gear is still there best one imo
[5:53:29] <Kaneis> Fuck this Broly is legit
[5:53:29] <waifoong98> also fuck off Pat, best Arcsys work game is GG PunOko

[5:53:47] <Run44forrest> ok so chat.. . Why not just replace Goku with Broly in Super now that hes Good
[5:53:49] <+Superkbrown95> Ok, cause ive thought about watching Dragon Ball but it seems too far to start, kinda like One Piece
[5:53:57] <%EyeRChris> Has @AngriestPat been sponsored by Red Bull yet?

[5:54:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Broly isn't good. He's better. A difference
[5:54:18] <Chumblago13> @Run44forrest I think before Goku has more personality it wouldnt work. But I like the way you think
[5:54:18] <Splatterfest> Pat should be sponsored by a funeral home
