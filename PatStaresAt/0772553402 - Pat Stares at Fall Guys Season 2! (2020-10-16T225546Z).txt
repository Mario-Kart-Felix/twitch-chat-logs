[0:04:11] <+Taglog7> Fall Guys with merge with Among us
[0:04:14] <Broken_Sonex> I expect Pat to NOT get a crown
[0:04:21] <DianaTheAscian> How many resistance weapons have you finished Pat
[0:04:27] <%NeedlesD> NeedlesD subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[0:05:17] <Broken_Sonex> If he DID get a crown, I wouldn't know how to feel.
[0:06:15] <conorscending> I like to imagine Pat runs exactly like the Beans do in the game
[0:06:38] <%maenos2> have we ever seen him truly run? maybe he does
[0:06:58] <DianaTheAscian> Can Pat run?

[0:07:14] <%maenos2> waddle aggressively
[0:07:14] <Broken_Sonex> He rolls
[0:07:28] <conorscending> @maenos2 right?? Maybe he‚Äôs hiding some secret power from the world...
[0:07:29] <Broken_Sonex> And Geif pushes him
[0:07:30] <@SoFarFetched> twitch gets fucky for people yeah tends to be either a restart or refresh
[0:08:03] <%XzileGaming> i imagine he runs like a person in a three legged race, but hes not tied to anyone
[0:08:10] <%RyanGelatin> strem hypeee
[0:08:14] <%shurtal> @SoFarFetched i just did a restart and windows update, and sadly this hasn't fixed it. Oh well, 160p pat for me!
[0:08:20] <%Bailey__gaming> Evening everyone hope Pat has SANIC costume
[0:08:29] <bob900000> Hey everyone!
[0:08:32] <%dekkitout> Pretty sure there's footage out there of Wide-Pat running
[0:08:34] <conorscending> @broken_sonex Geif molds him into a ball like that one time Michael Jordan did in Space Jam
[0:08:35] <%AzureGale> Who's ready to watch Pat rise?
[0:08:40] <DianaTheAscian> twitch has been freezing at random for me the last 3 weeks idk what causes it at this point
[0:08:42] <Broken_Sonex> I really want Zangeif to spear pat like Goldberg

Now I love metal music and wearing the shirts is 2nd nature. After walking through one of the most sacred parts of the Vatican, the Sistine Chapel, I realized I was wearing my Mastodon shirt. The one with the robed skeleton, with horns, doing a Jesus like pose with its hands. I may have been excommunicated!

[0:35:50] <surejanel> stick is my fave fruit in fruit chute
[0:35:52] <Zayasu> The phrase ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a game‚Äù is such a weak mindset. You are ok with what happened, losing, imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing, you‚Äôve lost twice. There‚Äôs always something to learn, and always room for improvement, never settle.
[0:35:52] <%AFlyingTaco1> Amazing

[0:40:23] <%JustYudha> 308000000000000000
[0:40:25] <D3rrtyD4n> i dont think ps4 runs as well
[0:40:27] <+G_Thunders> Ps4 pro runs the same. Normal ps4 has issues I think
[0:40:30] <+RowenCleric> it runs better than your pc Pat
[0:40:30] <trackles_64> imagine thinking that a console version is better than PC
[0:40:30] <%AzureGale> Well, most PS4 games, and they don't even completely guarantee it then
[0:40:32] <studleydoorite> let's all just get along and agree the switch sucks :)
[0:40:33] <%Cozy90> Pat you gonna try godfall on launch?
[0:40:35] <%Garthunox> ive never crashed on ps4

[0:40:50] <D3rrtyD4n> i play on a normal ps4

[0:40:51] <+tangoragahn> Yours crashed first rond tho
[0:40:51] <PortableBoredom> I have normal PS4 and it runs with zero issues
[0:40:56] <BlkFlameKami> too bad no mods
[0:41:05] <@SoFarFetched> it most certainly is the 90s is games from the 90s are coming back Kappa
[0:41:12] <%dekkitout> We all float down here
[0:41:13] <%Keyd00d> I agree
[0:41:15] <%g0atmeal> This one is way too easy
[0:41:16] <D3rrtyD4n> you can kill
[0:41:18] <studleydoorite> that Sonic LUL
[0:41:22] <%Valdorick> Wait... but will it also have cross platform saves like Divinty 2?
[0:41:23] <Saltmeisterr> I forgot the baldur gate games came to switch
[0:41:23] <%Ranryu692> yeah, this one takes too long
[0:41:24] <Dragovus> Throw them to their deaths
[0:41:24] <0rond> You are the one that make it violent
[0:41:26] <%Jekado> that sonic tried to be a cool guy
[0:41:26] <%DappercatEsquire> be the violence you want to see in the world @PatStaresAt
[0:41:26] <PE4X> then push other people down
[0:41:27] <+NitronStreams> this is an endurance game
[0:41:28] <SomeAsianDood> more faster
[0:41:28] <Kronark> No the real fun is killing the other fallguys.
[0:41:28] <%AzureGale> We all float on okay
[0:41:29] <+TopsyCretes> i just started bg on ps4 not having a prob
[0:41:30] <%shurtal> Grab people, grief 'em
[0:41:31] <%oniwahoo> Just kill then, Pat
[0:41:33] <poisin224> well then MAKE IT MORE VIOLENT, COWARD
[0:41:33] <%JustYudha> You can grab and push people. That's violent enough lol
[0:41:33] <Saltmeisterr> it was in a direct too
[0:41:35] <JonEWorldbeater> Do they keep your digital library on PS5? Don't see why they wouldn't
[0:41:37] <+the_krypto_knight> I was getting some big frame drops on ps4 right after season 2, but it‚Äôs been better lately
[0:41:37] <SpookyBeef7> The one thing I really feel the game needs is a proper spectator mode, so you can just do MXC style commentary on rounds.
[0:41:38] <studleydoorite> Sonic thought he had the light speed dash
[0:41:39] <D3rrtyD4n> that was fast
[0:41:40] <%Jekado> that was quick
[0:41:40] <%g0atmeal> You can literally just walk back in forth and you'll only lose if ppl force you
[0:41:40] <@SoFarFetched> wow that was fast
[0:41:40] <%ArcanumArcanum> @PortableBoredom bud a game running with zero issues on a console is not comparable to running better with a higher framerate on PC
[0:41:42] <%Keyd00d> you can just shuffle between the same 2 moving parts
[0:41:43] <0rond> @PatStaresAt it's on you to make it more violent
[0:41:46] <%dekkitout> Wait, it's a double positive in French?

[1:24:02] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt everyone who starts now, started because they're 14
[1:24:02] <+Promessa_EX> it's like drinking tea

[1:24:03] <GeneralHysterics> you don't understand it, you kinda do
[1:24:04] <%dekkitout> It mellows I'm told
[1:24:05] <scrublord009> YEAH YOU DO NICOTINE GETS YOU A BUZZ
[1:24:06] <%machshop> you get a nicotine buzz
[1:24:06] <wannabemoogle> I can't believe people still do Dip.
[1:24:07] <%Ranryu692> nicotine high is super real\
[1:24:07] <bob900000> its really dumb
[1:24:08] <%CalderGaming> it's a stimulant
[1:24:08] <+solidmclovin> the financial part of smoking and vapes has always been the main thing thats driving me towards quitting
[1:24:09] <Morbidmort> Yeah. Nicotine 's high is barely a buzz
[1:24:09] <DracaenaLeaf> it's an addiction
[1:24:10] <$RealThiele> im poor and smoked weed is cheaper than pain meds
[1:24:14] <studleydoorite> you do get high, very high tolerance quickly builds tho
[1:24:15] <%dekkitout> But that's the lack of oxygen doing that
[1:24:15] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> eventually the buzz goes away, though
[1:24:15] <DianaTheAscian> i heard it calms u
[1:24:16] <%king_wragles> More of a head rush, but it's not worth it
[1:24:17] <ahaegotrigger> you do get a rush
[1:24:18] <+Regigangster> How much have you spent on Genshin now?
[1:24:19] <+Flaming__Rhubarb> Not to mention 2nd hand smoking is a thing
[1:24:19] <RaidenRising> oh look , its shrek
[1:24:20] <2017y> you get focus and appetite suppression, pat the orb
[1:24:20] <medril07> you smoke to get back to normal
[1:24:21] <bigshedman> Yeah for the first week, and then you build enough tolerance that you don't feel anything.
[1:24:22] <+schlager087> it's the goddamn nicotine
[1:24:27] <$TheCrispyBoi> a lot of people use vapes a a step towards quitting
[1:24:28] <arielanarchy92> yeah it's weird
[1:24:29] <Blank9> you get more of a buzz from terrible food
[1:24:30] <TheAmazingClaytor> Yeah it's not like gambling, RIGHT PAT?
[1:24:31] <+Brainworm205> nicotine buzz is very real and very cool. its cool to smoke cigs. joe camel said so
[1:24:32] <%luketrapwalker> Yeah, but it sucks compared to cannabis.
[1:24:33] <%toastybites> cigarette to beers as weed to shots
[1:24:35] <%Ranryu692> cigars are dumb
[1:24:35] <DukeBlack_> marijuana also can smell good
[1:24:36] <%AncelDeLambert> it's a stimulant, Pat, and people like you and me with overactive livers can actually get benifits from it
[1:24:37] <%Mr_y1096> very good
[1:24:38] <%Daniel_Is_I> Mmm poison
[1:24:38] <@SoFarFetched> Paige will SUCK on that cigar
[1:24:39] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> it lowers stress pre-addiction
[1:24:40] <+solidmclovin> as a cuban anyone who isnt cuban and smokes a cigar is excommunicado
[1:24:40] <+schlager087> cigars can fuck you up man
[1:24:42] <%Dakuu75> the "buzz" from smoking is just oxygen deprivation
[1:24:42] <+I4gotmyname89> do cigars give you a buzz?
[1:24:43] <ftwsam98> cigars give you a buzz
[1:24:44] <%king_wragles> Tobacco just kills you. Pot makes you annoying... but there does seem to be pain benefits
[1:24:44] <%TrafficCohen> I used to smoke, rarely, but hated Cigars
[1:24:44] <%OhioNitsud> especially with an whiskey and coke
[1:24:44] <very_ap3> lemme just disappear into this chair while i finish my ciggarette
[1:24:44] <%g0atmeal> ppl act like weed isn't still smoking
[1:24:45] <EuropanLamprey> It's supposed to be sress relief

[1:24:46] <%AncelDeLambert> *cannot
[1:24:47] <%Starotter70> Do Cigars taste good with Mustard?
[1:24:49] <%chiazam> Cigars have tastes?
[1:24:49] <%nicoleymcquack> my parents restarted smoking after quitting for ten years because they're 20 year old neighbours peer pressured them lmao
[1:24:50] <$kingoftrashep> cigars are nice cigarettes are nasty
[1:24:50] <thatsocrunchy> It‚Äôs more so to relieve stress than to get high. Especially in people in their mid 20s.
[1:24:50] <%DakotaMacDoodle> @PatStaresAt Everyone in my family smokes except me and they do in fact all smell really bad

[1:27:38] <wannabemoogle> Same. The worst part is when you sell the house and have to clean off all the fucking tar off the walls. Tip use TSP melts it off.
[1:27:41] <%PanicSwytch> Bolth

[1:28:15] <%TheWinged7> so your saying Pat comes from a long line of dwarfs
[1:28:18] <%Aleate> My first memory of my dad was him sneaking a smoke when he was supposed to quit when I was born. Thats why I hate smoking... that smell
[1:28:18] <%asgard147> So Pat IS a dwarf! limesPoggers

[1:28:35] <%blitzrush1200> Pat really dislikes his brother
[1:28:38] <%nicoleymcquack> you hate vape by association with your brother
[1:28:40] <%huskarl_zap> Says the cigar smoker
[1:28:40] <SaltyAzteca> its just a phase
[1:28:41] <surejanel> im the tallest in my immediately family and i'm.... barely 5'0
[1:28:41] <DianaTheAscian> however
[1:28:42] <%Zeikier> all shitheads vape but not all vapers are shitheads?
[1:28:42] <@commanderclaw> At least there's fewer cigarette butts
[1:28:45] <%TrafficCohen> I used to say Pat was a Dwarf but i think he's actually from a family small enough to be gnomes
[1:28:46] <%za7az> Of course he does
[1:28:46] <Sol_Install> @Bigyanno Hamster meets banana there huh?
[1:28:47] <%Cozy90> Pat do you hate your brother?
[1:28:47] <%AFlyingTaco1> Wait how long has it been since you saw him in person?
[1:28:55] <%Zeikier> all my friends are goddamn tall beasts
[1:28:55] <+schlager087> @solidmclovin South Dakota here, people still think Hemp is Marijuana
[1:28:56] <augusta_wind> less cig butts yeah
[1:28:59] <%Valdorick> My father use to smoke, and my brother picked it up, and then his smoking evolved into CHEWS
[1:29:00] <+DavidHayder> LUL
[1:29:07] <@SoFarFetched> He's a good horse
[1:29:09] <sologarza> So Pat is 4‚Äô9‚Äù?
[1:29:13] <%Bmrandfriends> a vape whore
[1:29:14] <%TrafficCohen> Vap-pour wave
[1:29:16] <blackbookalpha> a Vicks Vaporub, that guy
[1:29:17] <%Agami23> is vape bad if theres no nicotine?
[1:29:18] <+solidmclovin> was it one of those big chonky vapes or the little death sticks
[1:29:20] <ShichiNoBushi> It still looks obnoxious and pretentious.
[1:29:21] <%uncle_grumps> Git 'em!
[1:29:22] <@SoFarFetched> Pat's like 5'2-5'3
[1:29:25] <+NitronStreams> at least most smokers ive known take their shit outside
[1:29:26] <%Profmcstevie> Money could go into video game, give many hours joy and smile
[1:29:26] <sologarza> Let the horse be
[1:29:33] <SpiritsRiseR2> is the cactus a representation of Pat's soul?
[1:29:34] <%Valdorick> I'm curious, Vaping vs Chews, which is worse?
[1:29:36] <+WingBuffet> mmm, fall guys have big pop tart drum
[1:29:39] <%zeif00> Adam also got like 8 inches on Pat
[1:29:43] <%SirGO0SE> im surprised the vapor doesnt just look like clouds to you from down there @PatStaresAt :)
[1:29:45] <ShichiNoBushi> He's a vapor?
[1:29:49] <@SoFarFetched> when I met Adam he was HUGE
[1:29:50] <+solidmclovin> @Agami23 i think vape without nicotine is specifically stupid unless its for the purpose of actually quitting
[1:29:53] <%g0atmeal> Depends on the solution you use, but none are good for you
[1:29:53] <%huskarl_zap> fidgets spinners deadly

[1:37:45] <%cvp5127> my friend sits on his seat belt
[1:37:46] <+G_Thunders> But why
[1:37:46] <augusta_wind> my dad is a COP and will sometimes not put on his seatbelt

[1:37:55] <popcultureaficionado> IT'S CAUSE YOUR DADS A BADASS PAT
[1:37:55] <%Dakuu75> that's when I take my seat-belt OFF. 1 block from the house
[1:37:56] <%seraphimjordan> thats why he did it
[1:37:56] <Arek_1> @PatStaresAt You weren't number 1. LUL
[1:37:58] <augusta_wind> like dad that's your JOB
[1:38:00] <very_ap3> most accidents happen within a mile from the house so that makes sense
[1:38:00] <+solidmclovin> the time when cars went like 20mph
[1:38:03] <+VaudeVille_Villain_> Horse don't got seatbelts
[1:38:03] <+Regigangster> It's the same as masks
[1:38:04] <%jjolion> Most cars play an alarm if you don't have your seatbelt on

[1:38:09] <+solidmclovin> sorry 10 kmh or whatever
[1:38:09] <doughboidankweed> seatbelts are for pussies
[1:38:11] <%nicoleymcquack> getting in a car wreck puts hair on your chest
[1:38:14] <%TrafficCohen> My mam does that, but her car BEEPS SUPER FUCKING LOUD WHEN SHE DOES THAT
[1:38:17] <+Promessa_EX> I have a habit of letting it beep for maybe 10 seconds
[1:38:17] <+schlager087> statistically speaking most accidents happen within 10 miles of home
[1:38:22] <+Blue256> like masks
[1:38:24] <+Metrick_92> Slow it down by 2 seconds?
[1:38:26] <Macfine> Seatbelts are the Vapes of the care
[1:38:28] <%Invlux> there was a guy who was tuning up my mom's car and was like "why have you driven 2 miles backwards without a seatbelt on"
[1:38:28] <Ell1ot> my friend didn't put her seat belt on. she got into an accident and needed staples on her head
[1:38:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i hate when they let it beep
[1:38:32] <%ssjklyco> Don't do it for safety, do it so you don't have to pay expensive tickets
[1:38:36] <%Typhaeon> All cars nowadays have the nanny seatbelt alert
[1:38:40] <+WingBuffet> why did Paige need to justify her seatbelt-wearing by being in a car accident? Do people in America not think seatbelts should be worn by default or something
[1:38:42] <%g0atmeal> That's only because you spend most time there
[1:38:47] <%ssjklyco> But what if you're 10 miles of someone elses home?
[1:38:48] <%Daniel_Is_I> Statistically speaking, most driving only occurs within 10 miles of the home
[1:38:48] <Bigyanno> Statistically speaking most driving happens within 10 miles of the home
[1:38:49] <%walternatorz> that's because most your driving is close to home
[1:38:50] <TheAmazingClaytor> Most car accidents occur in the bathroom
[1:38:53] <%NWR_James> I mean thats just becaue almost all driving is in that range
[1:38:59] <Macfine> statiscally speaking most of your driving is within 10 miles from your home too
[1:38:59] <$sniffy77> I was in a vehicle wreck this week where my car was totalled. If I wasn't wearing a seatbelt I would for sure have major head and arm injuries.
[1:39:01] <SaltyAzteca> That's right Dad, I mean Jay
[1:39:01] <%rdark_ksu> my dad lives in the country and bought fake seatbelt inserts so the car shuts up about it
[1:39:02] <+cgreene64> Statistically most driving happens within 10miles of your home
[1:39:02] <%maenos2> my late aunt didn't wear her seatbelt when she was in her 20s, and the guy driving the car got into an accident. she got her organs fucking FUCKED because of that.

[2:21:19] <%weissguard> OOF
[2:21:20] <roarinlala> stares in colonialism
[2:21:20] <%dekkitout> Newfoundland had a queen like Hawaii?
[2:21:23] <+Jaysky> FREE NEWFOUNDLAND
[2:21:24] <Morbidmort> @CalderGaming nah, the British gave it over, wasn't a military occupation
[2:21:28] <+Brainworm205> ok what about Nova Scotia tho?
[2:21:28] <%goose_attack_almanac> Is Newfoundland reverse Taiwan?
[2:21:29] <thebalticguy1> --+
[2:21:32] <santosm8> da bey
[2:21:34] <valcheese> they had one vote that was throne out by the colonial gov; then the second vote had canada added and the governement said everyone voted to join canada vice the US
[2:21:34] <%TheWinged7> oh boy, 3 wales?
[2:21:34] <G03933> thats 1 way conquer a country i suppose

[2:21:39] <$sniffy77> did it also have horrible attrocity committed to its natives like hawaii
[2:21:40] <%asgard147> Ah, now I get it
[2:21:41] <%OrangeMDT> coincidentally, Hawaiians are also stereotypically nice
[2:21:43] <+sinistersally> Then do Newfies hate the Welsh?
[2:21:44] <%Valask> ???
[2:21:45] <%Jeemukun> Newfoundland is discount Ireland
[2:21:46] <+CaptainJax> Hey Pat is Trailer Park Boys accurate to Canada?

[2:22:05] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> You could be from Dildo. Or you could be from Come By Chance.
[2:22:05] <%nicoleymcquack> okay but Wales is the land of sheep fucking, does newfoundland have similar quirk?
[2:22:06] <$happyface699> @captainjax Pat is ricky reborn but smarter
[2:22:11] <%GarbageNirvana> I guarantee you there are Hawaiians out there calling for annexation and independence
[2:22:14] <Morbidmort> the moratorium on cod
[2:22:14] <%Valask> this is a cultural oddity that must be protected
[2:22:18] <valcheese> newfoundland had close ties to communist cuba; the premiere used to host Castro in canada for official talks
[2:22:21] <%RyTYoung> @nicoleymcquack that's also Aberdeen
[2:22:23] <roarinlala> the only thing i know about newfoundland is the musical come from away which is pretty good

[2:32:24] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Fun Fact: The reason why farm houses in the middel fo fuck all no where have trees planted around them is to act as windbreaks so the building doesn't ice over

[2:34:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> All I know about PEI is Road to Avonlea
[2:34:16] <dandy_thimble> New Brunswick is the appendix of Canada
[2:34:16] <Admiral_PopnFresh> There's a reason why the northern territories are allowed to kill so much shit to survive
[2:34:17] <%Onlysamfisher > pat have you ever heard of the Canadian tv show about "Letterkenny" or is that just a made up Canadian tv land?
[2:34:21] <Yogurtmonkey> im sure the 7 people that live there are in agreement that it sucks
[2:34:23] <%Jeemukun> I live in PEI and even I don't give a fuck about it
[2:34:24] <%goose_attack_almanac> The last time my family went to PEI my brother got attacked by a Feral Cat. Aside from the Red Sand that was the most interesting thing that happened
[2:34:28] <+doomunderthestairs> I know the thread Paige is talking about it
[2:34:29] <%PaladinDupre> im in a Yukon right now, its white with a black interior
[2:34:30] <+sinistersally> No one live there except for like Ren Fair style actors
[2:34:36] <+doomunderthestairs> muffins were like 100 bucks
[2:34:38] <%superc37> doesnt canada also have a huge problem with racism against the native canadians? cuz thats probs why
[2:34:39] <+Rofiarf> "fresh"
[2:34:42] <+doomunderthestairs> for a 30 case
[2:34:42] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> PEI is awesome if you love mini golf, Anne of Green Gables, and potatoes.
[2:34:44] <%nicoleymcquack> the only exposure to the yukon was the cartoon Yvonne of the yukon and that suit made it look like he was from a country I've never heard of
[2:34:46] <Ozavic> Totally, up north Beer is cheaper than milk
[2:34:50] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @PaladinDupre Kappa
[2:34:53] <+Psitterrific> Everything has to be flown in on light airplanes
[2:34:55] <%Jeemukun> also Lobsters
[2:34:58] <DianaTheAscian> oh
[2:34:58] <$sniffy77> Who the hell decided to name it Prince Edwards Island. Thats a dumb name
[2:35:04] <dandy_thimble> Oh yeah we treat our natives terribly
[2:35:04] <Admiral_PopnFresh> what do you mean 4Head ?
[2:35:05] <thebalticguy1> Its so bad
[2:35:06] <+deviljhojho_> i've heard something about that
[2:35:07] <%Taisuru> @superc37 America does to
[2:35:09] <%shurtal> if anyone wants to see alot of pretty shit in interior BC and the Yukon, watch Road Quest on youtube. It's fucking great
[2:35:10] <thebalticguy1> Its mostly the natives
[2:35:11] <Yogurtmonkey> that seems like a constant. Every country just loves hating their natives
[2:35:12] <+Walopoh> So does Alaska and most of North Amercia
[2:35:12] <$sniffy77> like at least be named after a king or queen
[2:35:13] <Morbidmort> @nicoleymcquack he was a French explorer who got frozen in ice
[2:35:13] <+Jaysky> @Ozavic My dad has gone through spinal surgery, 5 hip replacements, ICU numerous times, meds up the wazoo. I shiver to think the medical bill if we were stateside.

[2:35:27] <santosm8> they all play for the raptors
[2:35:27] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> I'm not sure the prices are high for groceries in remote places because of racism, it might be because its in the middle of nowhere.
[2:35:28] <%Piemono> Is there any country that doesn't have a racist problem with their indigenous peoples?
[2:35:28] <%rdark_ksu> the idea is- hmm are you us? NO? fuck you!
[2:35:28] <Ozavic> Don't google 'Residential Schools'
[2:35:30] <blackbookalpha> Just Woolie
[2:35:30] <+Ellila> Woolie is 25% of the black community in Canada
[2:35:30] <roarinlala> there's woolie and his family and that's it?
[2:35:31] <%LordSDB> oof
[2:35:31] <%superc37> @taisuru well yeah, but that goes without saying.
[2:35:31] <%emperordread> Trudeau literally can't remember how many times he wore blackface
[2:35:31] <%shurtal> it's all focsed on the first nations
[2:35:31] <%TheWinged7> whats woolie then?
[2:35:33] <dots4eyes> We stole your land...also fuck you :/
[2:35:34] <%dekkitout> There's Woolie, Reggie, and uh...

[2:35:38] <0rond> Than what's the US' excuse?
[2:35:38] <%arancet> only woolie and reggie
[2:35:39] <%CzeekyPlays> So, Canada is the US Midwest
[2:35:39] <ScreamLord> Woolie, Reggie, and that's it
[2:35:40] <+Jaysky> Less guns too
[2:35:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> All of the racism is aimed at indiginous and the asians.
[2:35:41] <Morbidmort> It's cause we didn't breed them for slaves
[2:35:42] <santosm8> and reggie
[2:35:42] <Ozavic> @Jaysky I feel for you my dude
[2:35:43] <%LordSDB> woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:35:43] <%AFlyingTaco1> So like Woolie and Reggie and that's it?

[2:35:51] <+NerevaRising> This is pretty much the case in the entire planet

[2:35:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Again, I'm in North Dakota, very aware of the situation
[2:35:53] <thebalticguy1> 90% homeless ive seen in MTL is native
[2:35:56] <%JeanGardner99> man its still crazy that the residential school system ended like in the 50's
[2:35:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> @0rond Do you have several years? If so, sit down and I'll start.
[2:35:59] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> @superc37 There's a big situation in NS right now, with commercial fishermen literally attacking native fishermen.
[2:35:59] <+EdenOfLove> Despite being 2% of the population...
[2:36:00] <mattatatatatatatat> theres woolie thats it
[2:36:00] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Woolie is the 1%????
[2:36:02] <AMaidIndeed> Suddenly the Treudeau blackface makes more sense
[2:36:03] <%TubeMan642> That's becuse you sent the slave back Pat
[2:36:04] <+abrupt_abe> There was the recent article about the native woman made fun of on her deathbed
[2:36:06] <%Birdigalore> @PatStaresAt So what you're saying is we should send all our racists to live there since its all white folks? Cool thanks!
[2:36:07] <%Dylveryn> Canada still does steriliztion to natives
[2:36:09] <+Soulsbjorne> Are we talking about Innuits?
[2:36:10] <%Taisuru> as they fade in and out if existence?
[2:36:10] <%rdark_ksu> Yea you just had the chinese with the railroads, which fair enough so did we
[2:36:11] <kesler031> that thing
[2:36:12] <zekana> slaves were fleeing TOO canada so makes sense
[2:36:12] <%goose_attack_almanac> WE LEARN ABOUT THOSE AND THEIR HORRIFIC
[2:36:12] <Naid_Jart> I once met Trudeau in Ottawa, I beat him on a game of Ice Hockey
[2:36:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Americans had that too
[2:36:13] <+Psitterrific> until the 90s!
[2:36:13] <%Jekado> Americanization
[2:36:14] <%Piemono> Yeah we did that too though
[2:36:17] <Morbidmort> America also had them schools
[2:36:17] <+Soulsbjorne> Like when you say Natives
[2:36:18] <+seoliart> America also had residential schools but they closed them 20 years earlier than Canada
[2:36:18] <$sniffy77> I actually like on a street called Indian School
[2:36:19] <%dekkitout> Oh god, Canada had those too monkaS

[2:36:55] <Ozavic> Soree for the eugenics, eh?
[2:36:55] <+LacarisBarber> Chinese Uighurs mode
[2:36:56] <StaticSunrise> it's "the church"'s fault
[2:36:56] <%Onlysamfisher > indoctrination?
[2:36:56] <anAngryHamster> "We need to save them from their own savagery"
[2:36:56] <%Nomad_Scholar> @PatStaresAt "Kill the Indian, save the child."
[2:36:57] <%PaladinDupre> MANIFEST DESTINY
[2:36:57] <%JeanGardner99> yeah they had problems with sterilizing women who gave birth
[2:36:58] <xxshadowxx416> sound like us why
[2:36:59] <%emperordread> The Candaian government would literally steal babies from natives and raise them 'proper'
[2:37:00] <dots4eyes> There must be one race....an ULTIMATE race...said some villain
[2:37:00] <orlauncelot> Gentrification is residential overpricing
[2:37:01] <%Invlux> There's a North Carolina tax credit for if you got sterilized by the state
[2:37:01] <+Walopoh> Fuck politeness
[2:37:01] <%Cozy90> IS EVERYONE JUST QUOTING STORMFRONT?
[2:37:03] <Morbidmort> Also child snatching and forced adoptions.
[2:37:03] <roarinlala> the schools used to say kill the indian save the man which is DISGUSTING
[2:37:06] <+CaptainJax> Why the fuck are WE the ones having the race wars then what the FUCK
[2:37:07] <sackerkappa> So Woolie is essentially an unicorn in Canada, huh?
[2:37:07] <%medusasghost> in conclusion every country sucks
[2:37:07] <+Psitterrific> And take babies because their parent were poor. But not do that to white people
[2:37:10] <+doomunderthestairs> don't
[2:37:11] <%toastybites> the drug problems the natives go through is rough
[2:37:11] <%asgard147> "The troubles"
[2:37:12] <eternalquarantine> in canada everybody smiles
[2:37:15] <%PaladinDupre> @cozy90 yes.
[2:37:15] <%huskarl_zap> I'm loud.
[2:37:18] <%bevyrage> american education doesn't like talking about whenever they or their neighbors had history to do some awful shit
[2:37:18] <Morbidmort> @PaladinDupre that was just the US and their wars
[2:37:19] <+eyezehuhh> shits fucked
[2:37:19] <FeralRageGaming> Yeah, America!!! We're loud!!!

[2:37:20] <+CookieCutter007> YEEHAW
[2:37:20] <%nicoleymcquack> honestly until I started following a native girl on insta I had no idea how shitty the racism is in canada
[2:37:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> Anyone who thinks that Canadains are just polite doesn't see the fucked up shit we sweep under the Northwest Territories.
[2:37:27] <%Jekado> hide the atrocities
[2:37:28] <StaticSunrise> it's not that canada has no problems, it's that america is super fucked up
[2:37:28] <+Soulsbjorne> We deserve nothing but shame
[2:37:28] <%Cozy90> @PaladinDupre hahahaha
[2:37:28] <Gallhint> everyone is horrible
[2:37:30] <%dekkitout> That's one way to put it I guess...
[2:37:33] <+Walopoh> YEA fuck being quiet about evil
[2:37:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> When an American has a problem, YOU KNOW we have a problem.
[2:37:37] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Cozy90 Look out for Al Bhed brudda
[2:37:38] <dots4eyes> Don't let the Americans know....

[2:37:40] <+Pookiedaexzile> Shhhhhh, Just let the Americas Take the ticket
[2:37:41] <Naid_Jart> @PatStaresAt does Canada recognize natives as a nation?
[2:37:43] <medril07> that's fucking fucked
[2:37:44] <%toastybites> Canada likes to pretend it's not racist but all just more passive vs full on aggressive

[2:39:27] <ScreamLord> Iroquois was and alliance of Native tribes not a tribe in and of itself
[2:39:28] <%devanmuse> which is worse? sweeping your racist past under the rug? or fighting to keep up statues celebrating your racist past?

[2:46:20] <FeralRageGaming> @abrupt_abe cause it saves time, and usually before you go inside you wipe your shoes on the doormat. Also, the general rule of thumb is you just don't step in anything when outside
[2:46:21] <%Jekado> Being Asian American its pretty offensive. first time i saw it i was confused
[2:46:22] <%Bmrandfriends> when do u put your shoes

[2:52:08] <Arek_1> Eh...
[2:52:09] <%CalderGaming> @PatStaresAt I bet they use that as an excuse to not pull out, too
[2:52:10] <%Valdorick> Uh, Pat
[2:52:11] <%Daniel_Is_I> I mean I don't
[2:52:12] <%Agami23> my family is full of a bunch of navy people. they do infact eat crayons but also play doh

[2:52:16] <+thackattack00> not really
[2:52:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Admiral_PopnFresh Why do you think they made them non-toxic?
[2:52:16] <SummonerMagno> until they are old
[2:52:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> US is all volunteer too
[2:52:17] <+deviljhojho_> if it works it works
[2:52:18] <%Jekado> yeah in america its fucked since you sometimes don't have a choice
[2:52:18] <%Valdorick> ... We're Volenteer too.
[2:52:19] <Broken_Sonex> FUCK HER PREGNANT. NEVER RETREAT!
[2:52:19] <%rdark_ksu> the US is totally volunteer too
[2:52:23] <+Pookiedaexzile> You get PTsd and surprisingly low salary
[2:52:23] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Air Force stereotype is steak dinners and wine
[2:52:23] <+Taglog7> Military is our welfare
[2:52:24] <KaiserMario> "Never retreat" sounds dangerously close to "never take 'no' for an answer"
[2:52:27] <%Mr_y1096> us is 100% volunteer too
[2:52:30] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @CommanderSqueaks LUL
[2:52:31] <+StrawberryPantsu> It's free
[2:52:35] <%realm_forge> It‚Äôs a fetish to southern people
[2:52:35] <%Jekado> they get an education then not
[2:52:35] <%nicoleymcquack> my dad was un the navy for like 30 years and he's actually the most educated man I know tbf
[2:52:36] <+Sadira_snack_attack> um Pat, the US military is all volunteer
[2:52:36] <Aydarkzero> nice
[2:52:36] <DianaTheAscian> most of my friends who went into the military got fucked in some way
[2:52:38] <CappuccinoGuil> Because the poverty draft is a thing
[2:52:43] <silentblast93> and the air force is a glorafied office job
[2:52:44] <+deviljhojho_> think of the money
[2:52:45] <%medusasghost> they are tempted into it if we're poor
[2:52:46] <%LiquidDinosaur> @soundcloud_raptor TO BE FAIR Im pretty sure the royal family does "make the country money" so like it pays for itself economically. I jus think its like, "morally wrong"
[2:52:46] <xxshadowxx416> they get a gi bill
[2:52:47] <GeneralHysterics> and that's just the officers, ROTC
[2:52:48] <%coreyyotto> it's quite shit actually
[2:52:51] <reonome> blackmail kids into joining the army
[2:52:54] <%OrangeMDT> she's saying it still sucks
[2:52:55] <+StrawberryPantsu> Most people come out of the service better off
[2:52:55] <%Agami23> paige thats dumb
[2:52:55] <%NeoCre> We are also voluntary
[2:52:56] <+Taglog7> Maybe the chAIR force
[2:52:56] <Blank9> volunteer, but heavily incentivized for people with less options
[2:52:57] <%TheWinged7> they get access to a good education then
[2:52:57] <%Jekado> its America we don't do "Good Education"
[2:52:59] <%superc37> us military is """volunteer""" if your poor or some shit
[2:52:59] <%huskarl_zap> Its all office jobs
[2:53:00] <%Idziman> Join the army so they can handle all your expenses
[2:53:01] <Jetsfantasy> We're volunteer also, it's just life is fucked over by the higher society into going into the military. So its a "choice"
[2:53:02] <GeneralHysterics> I think you need to be in for a long time to get actual education
[2:53:03] <+southofhades> recruiters will also straight up lie to get you in
[2:53:04] <+lag2993> paige what do you do with your good education streaming?
[2:53:05] <+StrawberryPantsu> But fucked in the head
[2:53:05] <%ssjklyco> Most education is good, people are just dump
[2:53:06] <+buttdirt> makes education more affordable
[2:53:06] <thebalticguy1> The army is where the poor go to die
[2:53:07] <+deviljhojho_> not me tomatoSmile
[2:53:08] <%coreyyotto> it's a decent education with a side of severe PTSD
[2:53:09] <%OperatorJo_> You got that college money? God forbid world war 3 happens bud
[2:53:09] <%Ranryu692> not all educations are good educations
[2:53:09] <%superc37> YOU GET FREE SHIT
[2:53:10] <G03933> yea, Debri screwed over a lot of veterans a few years ago
[2:53:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> @silentblast93 The Air Force is the branch that every branch makes fun of because we are all secretly jealous of how good they've got it.
[2:53:10] <%Dakuu75> insentives?
[2:53:11] <+Blargimazombie> Higher education, not necessarily good
[2:53:12] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> You get financial aid for college.
[2:53:12] <%OrangeMDT> army bad. exploit poors
[2:53:13] <CappuccinoGuil> Pat, remember Student Debt?
[2:53:13] <%NWR_James> If you join the military they pay for college
[2:53:14] <blackbookalpha> Hey kids do you like video games? Join the army
[2:53:18] <+StrawberryPantsu> Kinda
[2:53:19] <%Birdigalore> You get a coupon for college
[2:53:20] <%nicoleymcquack> it's an alternative to expensive college and they send you on free courses
[2:53:20] <Broken_Sonex> Never Retreat.....Never take "no" for an answer......
[2:53:21] <DianaTheAscian> keep it hard for people so they join the military
[2:53:21] <%likethemusiq> no scholarship
[2:53:22] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt there was a video on Twitter about what guys would say to their army recruiter
[2:53:24] <%likethemusiq> thats a lie
[2:53:24] <%ElkRiverDog> Can.exe has stopped working
[2:53:24] <%ennui_on_me> it's not good education, it's an education
[2:53:25] <%Gogogolem> Yep.
[2:53:25] <$Caped_Eggy> There's a lot of gov programs
[2:53:25] <UlriktheSlayer1> they prey on the poorer folk
[2:53:25] <+StrawberryPantsu> They pay for your school
[2:53:25] <Jetsfantasy> If you're poor, the military pays for your shit
[2:53:26] <derekwst3> if you join the military they give you access to more things
[2:53:26] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Oppotunities
[2:53:27] <EuropanLamprey> They pay for your college
[2:53:28] <sackerkappa> In theory, some people join the Army so they'd get their college expenses paid.
[2:53:29] <+Shacklebox> GI bill gives free college
[2:53:29] <%huskarl_zap> My tax dollars
[2:53:29] <%LiquidDinosaur> scholarships
[2:53:29] <%dekkitout> GI Bill?
[2:53:30] <%Jekado> if you can't afford college you can do the army basically
[2:53:30] <Cerabret100> For people with low economic prospects, the military is seen as a good option to lift yourself up
[2:53:30] <+southofhades> they'll pay for school, but that doesn't mean you get into harvard
[2:53:30] <%Vyskus> the american armed forces sells access to upper education in order to get the kids when they're young and poor
[2:53:30] <TomFrancis_> they literally pay for college
[2:53:30] <%AFlyingTaco1> Not exactly
[2:53:32] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> oh the GI bill?
[2:53:32] <%zestyArsenic> access doesnt make you smarter
[2:53:32] <%arancet> you get money for school is all
[2:53:32] <%W1nterTitan> School is expensive Army give money
[2:53:33] <FeralRageGaming> @LiquidDinosaur So does Royalty actually ever do ANYTHING nowadays besides be rich and famous? Also, yeah as an American I can confirm we are BIG PROUD with military. Get a gun, fight for your country, you get paid + educated
[2:53:33] <%Profmcstevie> It's AN education, compared to fucking poverty experiences
[2:53:35] <%rdark_ksu> I have no money, if i join the forces for 4 years i can go to college on the GI bill instead of working dead end shit
[2:53:36] <%likethemusiq> its garbage tho
[2:53:38] <%MechArch> part 4
[2:53:38] <%Valask> there are not many ways to explain this lmao
[2:53:39] <sentientvin> some aid*
[2:53:40] <Aydarkzero> oh damn it's the last round
[2:53:43] <Blank9> they generally do not go for cheap education, they go for early pensions
[2:53:43] <%cobalt_phoenix_> "hey kid come get ptsd for free college"
[2:53:44] <kokobwarewolf> you've got to be stupid to g into the military anyway. no amount of education fixes that kind of stupidity
[2:53:45] <+StrawberryPantsu> No
[2:53:45] <D3rrtyD4n> lol
[2:53:45] <%dekkitout> Motherfuckers tend to waste their signing bonuses
[2:53:45] <%cylish> and they are
[2:53:46] <+Psitterrific> you get money they withheld from you pay for college
[2:53:46] <%goose_attack_almanac> Didn't the US Armed Forces start a Twitch account and start putting names down on a list?
[2:53:47] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt GI bill gives you a fat paycheck for college and its more attractive to people who grew up poorer
[2:53:48] <TrollKing96> My younger brother is joining the Marines. Wanted to be EOD but has to be Artillery first.

[3:04:11] <%nicoleymcquack> all three of my siblings were, I was the only planned one
[3:04:16] <%SvenHolgersson> Our dad announced to us we were all accidents so not to expect any special treatment
[3:04:16] <+captain_thickthighs> I once used at least I was planned as an insult once in middle school
[3:04:17] <arkv01> yo corey just had bad folks

[3:04:18] <%NeoCre> If I got in a fight my parents never went at me
[3:04:24] <%emperordread> I was in the room when a mom called her daughter "An unexpected miracle"
[3:04:25] <%Valdorick> @Piemono Some kids that aren't planned are resented by their parents.
[3:04:25] <Cleric4gg> Damn
[3:04:25] <Broken_Sonex> You could see they wanted to be free
[3:04:26] <+Walopoh> My little sister was the accident and it's an awkward topic

[3:04:38] <silentblast93> yes
[3:04:41] <%kewlmyc> When you have a single mom your entire life, it's kinda obvious you were an accident. :(

[3:07:12] <%dekkitout> Lawn darts was a 60's thing
[3:07:14] <%Spyke889> @PatStaresAt I find it hilarious that a toy that was super dangerous was named CPS
[3:07:15] <primaryfire> it kept escalating, now kids bring rifles
[3:07:18] <%realm_forge> I had the 3000 I was a monster
[3:07:22] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I played lawn darts.

[3:07:23] <+southofhades> I played with lawn darts and i came out with both eyes
[3:07:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> At least it wasn;t the super soaker that shot fake jizz.
[3:07:23] <%RyTYoung> oh god
[3:07:24] <Aydarkzero> lawn darts are a myth

[3:07:39] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Grandma and Grandpa's farm had all the best toys.
[3:07:43] <%BubbaRands> good idea boys
[3:07:45] <g1Branch> Lawn darts are a thing I've only ever seen in Deadrising 2, never in real life

[3:07:58] <arkv01> there were JOB classes on the playground
[3:08:00] <%Agami23> i think the best is the belt that had a gun on it that shot BB pellets and it got recalled because it would explode kids crotchs off
[3:08:00] <%RyTYoung> omg
[3:08:00] <%Nomad_Scholar> God
[3:08:02] <black_pariah> @PatStaresAt i was 10 when that came out, i remember literally getting in a cps driveby

[3:08:03] <DianaTheAscian> yeah
[3:08:07] <%TubeMan642> that play ground shit was great
[3:08:07] <Reborn2killu> we used to launch safety pins at each other

[3:08:16] <Badgerconda_> Yeah! Preferably on top of a giant snow bank from them plowing the parking lot.
[3:08:16] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Dude group brawls were fun.
[3:08:16] <+captain_thickthighs> Beyblades was banned once because we would make custom spinners from our dads tools
[3:08:17] <Dr_Mooose> rock fights
[3:08:17] <%Bmrandfriends> red rover baby
[3:08:18] <+Jaysky> The law for our playground was the fastest kids were the most popular
[3:08:21] <+CaptainJax> I went to a little league baseball game once where some dipshit kid nailed himself in the head after throwing rocks in the air
[3:08:23] <%Nomad_Scholar> My school has a baller af playground
[3:08:24] <Aydarkzero> we threw rocks at other kids who were trying to climb up the hill and if they made it they got to throw rocks
[3:08:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> Dodge Rock was fun.
[3:08:25] <CrimsonGargoyle> too real LUL
[3:08:26] <%nicoleymcquack> we used to climb super tall trees and the teachers would just be like "okay but don't go to the top"

[3:08:35] <dots4eyes> The original Super Smash Bros
[3:08:35] <%Agami23> pat, didnt your grandpa cut trees down by tying a shotgun shell to a stick and smacking it against the tree?
[3:08:36] <%rdark_ksu> we played red rover in the field next to the school and the meta was to fucking clothes line a fucker
[3:08:36] <zekana> went to elementary school in the 90's. we basically did dodge ball or pokemon

[3:08:40] <%twistedj3ster> I wish my school was like that
[3:08:40] <%LiquidDinosaur> we used to put a bench by the wall and everyone would sit on the bench and one person had to walk through the path while we KICKED THEM AS HARD AS POSSIBLE
[3:08:42] <FeralRageGaming> with sticks and pinecombs
[3:08:42] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @PatStaresAt is that why you love Yakuza?
[3:08:42] <%aslfrasle> @PatStaresAt Me and my brothers would get inside sleeping bags and just fall down the stairs for fun

[3:08:46] <%ssjklyco> They play fall guys
[3:08:46] <absentking> king of the snow =hill was my jam
[3:08:47] <King_Kth> remember those bouncy balls/ super balls with the metal ball in the middle, and there was always that kid who would bounce it right into their eye and have a huge shiner like they got beat
[3:08:47] <tukds> Soft kid bones, and fast regen was the shit
[3:08:48] <%BubbaRands> If you didn't have broken bones by the end of elementary school you were doing it wrong
[3:08:49] <LilacsandFreedom> I remember a giant red rover game on the black top one day...it ended with a lot of kids getting run over and the game banned so F
[3:08:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> I pasted a kid in the dome with a baseball and he got a detached retina

[3:09:13] <%bevyrage> i was banned from the playground brawls in 5th grade for actually being strong enough to cause injury
[3:09:13] <DashXero> Fistfighting is best for children. It teaches you where you stand. And if you have the option of using violence to solve your problems.
[3:09:16] <medril07> I miss being able to run on gravel driveways
[3:09:18] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> No but kids today get to experience the dark ages
[3:09:19] <%miabyte> Honestly I kind of want to put 99 kids in an arena and see which one survives. Hunger Games baby let's go.
[3:09:19] <sirscumbag13> My brothers and I used to just put our heads in pillow cases and headbutt the shit out of eachother
[3:09:20] <Ipsenscastle> needed my knee screwed back together

[3:09:31] <%NeoCre> I grew up when it was phased out. Got in trouble for playing tag
[3:09:35] <+The_Butterfly_Man> we had metal railings that would get real hot from the sun so the game was a 1v1 of who could keep their hand on the longest and I was pretty good at it
[3:09:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> @DashXero what about just giving them a knife
[3:09:38] <%realm_forge> I went to a fuckin malfoy factory where kids threatened to sue each other

[3:28:42] <%Invlux> @ergulor holy shit, twinsies
[3:28:42] <medril07> why?
[3:28:49] <%MechArch> being excommunicated sounds rad
[3:28:53] <InfiniteSwagbito> You both have the same grandpa
[3:28:53] <+captain_thickthighs> I wonder what's the coolest thing a person has been excommunicated for
[3:29:10] <commanderapathy> I don't have to worry about excommunication because of my agnosticism
[3:29:11] <+captain_thickthighs> like excommunicated sounds kind of cool so I would want to go out not looking like a bitch
[3:29:16] <%Bmrandfriends> tye whos a what

[3:29:24] <CrimsonGargoyle> john wick
[3:29:26] <%MechArch> cross-comunicated
[3:29:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Apparently he also was a massive prick in general, which played a part in why he was excommunicated.
[3:29:29] <+captain_thickthighs> like you know if you get an excommunicated you might want to choke slam a priest or something before hand
[3:29:31] <medril07> He was burned at the stake wasn't he?
[3:29:35] <%Das_Bass> Snowden?
[3:29:36] <%Monkeyweed21> Coppernicus dodged that shit

[3:30:00] <%Invlux> @rumtumtugnutz That would be wild but unless my grandpa had any kids I'm not aware of, no
[3:30:05] <%Ranryu692> Madonna got excommunicated for fucking a black Jesus in a music video; that's not a bad way to get it done
[3:30:10] <%BubbaRands> he snor
[3:30:12] <%Jeemukun> Galileo was a douchebag
[3:30:15] <+Walopoh> Galileo's body was dug up by the church, cut off his fingers for keepsakes and his corpse burned
[3:30:16] <medril07> I'll repent if they're about to murder me
[3:30:19] <%mike2hands> More like cowardnicus
[3:30:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Ranryu692 That's pretty good.
[3:30:21] <+JVolfram> Aquinas was almost excommunicated which is pretty funny to think about in hindsight
[3:30:26] <%Jeemukun> and the worst he got was house arrest in a fucking mansion
[3:30:32] <%nicoleymcquack> sorry pay but did my donation not have a message?? :(

[3:31:04] <doughboidankweed> metal asf
[3:31:04] <cumurasame> Yeah, NotWesker at best sounds like he maybe took English as... idk a 4th language
[3:31:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> @OldOnyx So he got exactly what he wanted?
[3:31:08] <%realm_forge> LUL
[3:31:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Invlux @ergulor then this must be an alternate universe situation.

[3:50:27] <%Jekado> stealing money from a drug lord seems like a legit plan that could never go wrong.
[3:50:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> tht almost makes it WORSE because he has no excuse
[3:50:32] <%miabyte> how likely is it that he'd catch covid?

[3:50:59] <T_Sasquatch> stealing from your parents as a kid has never lead down a good path
[3:51:06] <Morbidmort> when you have that to compare to
[3:51:06] <%Agami23> pat and his brother are actually split in two with the tiger talisman from jackie chan adventures
[3:51:13] <stellar_flare> Having a cautionary tale does a lot for you growing up
[3:51:16] <+Pookiedaexzile> Middle Child Madness is real
[3:51:19] <%Valdorick> BEING THE YOUNGEST IS THE RADDEST

[3:51:53] <%Dakuu75> uhhhh....

[3:51:56] <+Ryuuken1789> God dammit Pat, right in my childhood doodLUL
[3:51:57] <%AFlyingTaco1> Wait how many siblings do you have, Paige?
[3:51:57] <%BubbaRands> as a middle child... I understand...
[3:51:59] <%realm_forge> I love being roughly 4x the size of my older bro
[3:52:00] <+Blargimazombie> I'm the youngest... and the oldest..
[3:52:00] <neVan0> ewwww
[3:52:00] <+mckraven> I got retroactively turned into the middle child
[3:52:01] <%rdark_ksu> Also the youngest here, is nice
[3:52:02] <%ssjklyco> I'm technically the middle child if you count my sister from my dads last marriage
[3:52:05] <+MidnightBurst12> Middle children are for making fun of
[3:52:13] <cumurasame> ...So, Pat, iirc, you said, god forbid, if anything happened to your sister, you wouldn't take in your nephew/nieces, but if YOUR brother raised his hand and said he'd do it, would you take them then to stop him?

[4:02:40] <%maenos2> @LiquidDinosaur I'd love to honestly but i've moved on. Someday they'll answer for it. By the time we found out, they'd wasted the money away.
[4:02:41] <%Dakuu75> Blood is thicker than water but, right and wrong are thicker than blood
[4:02:42] <@PlagueOfGripes> corporate buyouts are more important than your children
