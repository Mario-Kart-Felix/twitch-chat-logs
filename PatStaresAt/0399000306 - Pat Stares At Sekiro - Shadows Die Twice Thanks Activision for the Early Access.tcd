[1:43:17] <+captain_history> Dogen-sama
[1:43:18] <Kiari13> this is just barely like dark souls
[1:43:21] <%Mendin> Oh that's the Petrified Blacksmith analogue
[1:43:24] <%lewdskeletor13> It has all the elements of a Souls game, Estes flask, homeward bone, bonfires

[1:43:44] <Mechazoic_Era> treasure FISH
[1:43:46] <%SrG00SE> sorry, but if this game wasnt made by From then people would be calling it a souls clone
[1:43:47] <%primax104> how's it going so far Pat?
[1:43:47] <%ScreamingMeat> All treasure lost
[1:43:48] <KnightDio> Weeb boi gets a weeb arm to kill weeb dudes
[1:43:48] <StromkoPenguin> It seems about as close to DS as Bloodborne was.
[1:43:49] <fmc009> Soulsborne Kreygasm
[1:43:49] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Back to the past Samurai PAt
[1:43:51] <+Tadashi047> you can use the buddha statue to travel too
[1:43:51] <complicatedclarity> I hope this game have it's own version of tarkus
[1:43:52] <FaryaAndWolyo> Wait was that a homeward bone, or was that the mark where you lose your dosh?
[1:43:58] <%nanov11> this is so ds
[1:44:06] <Valdorick> I feel bad for FromSoft - the will never have their action games be pure again, they will ALWAYS be compared to Dark Souls.
[1:44:12] <%0dokuro> To a talon
[1:44:15] <CybertronPrime> It's so Dark Souls it hurts.
[1:44:19] <+Austinck> Is this game better than mini ninja the greatest ninja game

[1:44:21] <$HentaiSenpai9K> GET OVER HERE
[1:44:21] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@jyeowa)
[1:44:23] <cbdg> well it doesn't help if all UI elements look nearly the same
[1:44:24] <Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 Pat: there's no way this highly modifiable robo arm could have come from the 7 foot tall master craftsman. Also Pat: HaHa I'm a weeb and have to put it in japanese, leaving anyone who wants to listen to the stream while they play or do something else with their balls in their hands.
[1:44:25] <RedDeadWine1277> turn arm into gun
[1:44:26] <Make_me_mad> If they didn't want it compared to souls, they should make it less of a souls game.
[1:44:30] <Deekman> dogs are 1 hit kill with shurikens
[1:44:30] <FaryaAndWolyo> What's wrong with it being darksouls esk? This is a really good game.
[1:44:31] <%Mendin> @Valdorick Nah they just need to bring back their mecha games
[1:44:35] <%lewdskeletor13> The game has obvious and blatant parallels to the Souls series, denying that is ridiculous
[1:44:37] <$cureneckbeard> Drop your thick shields
[1:44:37] <Valdorick> I can't wait for Metal Wolf Chaos XD to come out, and all the people who compare it to Dark souls

[2:14:01] <Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 so, the story of how i got poop in my pants without pooping? I kayaked out to an island in a lake for a picnic, hadn't pooped in days. then I got the squirts, had no time to get back to land, so i squatted in a bush. but splatter is a bitch. got it all on the seat of my pants and inside my shoes. wanted to die. after I kayaked back I took a scalding hot shower and scrubbed myself pink. but when I started to dry off with a towel, I realized it was the towel I sat on in the kayak. oops.
[2:14:01] <Apocalypse89> You've gotten a few just killing randos
[2:14:01] <+Tkelii> THEYRE 10 COINS PAT

[2:14:03] <Valask> fuck this stream is unusually early so I get to watch live for once, but I don't want to soil this game for myself
[2:14:03] <%SickBangerzM9> omg hes actually doing "i might need it later" thing
[2:14:04] <%daisyyyy> Its a common drop
[2:14:04] <+ataxiasuffuse> never use the things, what if you need them later
[2:14:05] <DayDayMaccin1> Yo get them from enemies
[2:14:05] <+KragPlays> You buy more Pat, that is what money is for
[2:14:05] <%ThatGuyfromMars> remember, pat doesn't use things because he might need them one day
[2:14:06] <dukenux> First time i see Pat playing Sekiro, and he just murders a giant chicken LUL
[2:14:06] <+loukemia83> you get at least one every time you kill an enemy
[2:14:08] <+zaworldo> PAT @AngriestPat THEY'RE SUPER CHEAP. you also get MORE from killing enemies
[2:14:09] <NivekMD> LUL

[2:14:15] <$ESP_ROOT> you get decent change a bit later
[2:14:16] <Make_me_mad> I understand and am fully in agreement with Pat's refusal to use shit like that.

[2:23:10] <Calamity2007> @Rayorin Nah Pat went down so fast they didn't even have time to S rank him
[2:23:11] <Devorteck> Locked into the bad ending now BibleThump
[2:23:11] <natebud> And then Pat remembered this is a stealth game too.
[2:23:13] <+D1ABOL1K> That was at least a child or tow

[2:23:21] <%magicaki> I thought dying would avoid spreading dragon AIDS, but it doesn't.
[2:23:23] <thegreenbenis> STILL COUNTS
[2:23:23] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> they get sick on respawn
[2:23:24] <%0dokuro> just remember "stealth"

[2:23:33] <+captain_history> i think the sickness is when you die after resurrecting once

[2:24:07] <Zombrocom> @MarylandJutsu I am 99.9% sure that is not the case, respawning spreads dragonrot, there is no reason not to rez

[2:24:22] <AlasterAngelo> @LegendaryDorkKnight you'd be right
[2:24:23] <KnightDio> Who cares about the sickness anyway, you're immortal and it doesn't affect you, isn't this like Pat greatest dream ?

[2:35:28] <+asgard147> Pat....are you okay?
[2:35:30] <$Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> This game throws spirit tokens at you, the game WANTS you to use the most important part of your toolkit
[2:35:35] <$ESP_ROOT> oh. yeah enemies drop spirit tokens frequently
[2:35:36] <larrata20> in retrospective, DS nd bloodborse had pats one salvation: barely no platforming
[2:35:41] <%sweenicus> pat, do the video game
[2:35:43] <Dragon_Batman> Bull, you did

[2:35:51] <+KragPlays> That doesn‚Äôt make you cool Pat
[2:35:52] <rytisone> they're bullets in dmc
[2:35:52] <TyrantBelial> But you needed to.
[2:35:56] <$ESP_ROOT> @HyperCharge_Sam very
[2:35:58] <%magicaki> Literally a full half of the mechanics are using the damn bullets.
[2:36:01] <kingra> Tengu <3

[2:36:08] <tUxUt> one day pat will have to face his massive issue of stockpiling supplies instead of lamenting that he does it & then continuously justifying it
[2:36:10] <Valdorick> I seem to recall Woolie used the most bullets in bloodborne, during the playthrough... so I believe it..
[2:36:10] <%0dokuro> This place is really important pat
[2:36:17] <Valdorick> I mean, he sure as fuck never shot Kos!
[2:36:18] <+McSoliace> you will need them for bosses

[2:36:37] <%0dokuro> He's reliving memories
[2:36:41] <lizard0tm> That's why he has the prosthetic arm
[2:36:42] <Pseudonymity> so it's real time travel, not fake time travel with secret missions
[2:36:43] <natebud> Oh, THAT year

[3:01:38] <Storm_Samurai> "A sandwich refers to an arrangement of ingredients, such that everything is between 2 pieces of bread (or a split roll). A non-burger filling (let's say a grilled chicken breast) on a typical hamburger bun would be classified as a grilled chicken sandwich, not a chicken burger."

[3:07:41] <%PokemonTrainer> Pat is bad sneaky
[3:07:58] <DracaenaLeaf> How come that enemy can see behind walls while everyone else is blind

[3:08:27] <@BigNaturalMan59> akko?!?
[3:08:33] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat just curious but how come you never finished Nioh?
[3:08:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> red symbol means you can instakill if you parry
[3:08:34] <%0dokuro> Ako's opium

[3:08:54] <Senselessvirus> @AngriestPat Pat you need to master the technique of [GRAPPLE AWAY] when people start searching for you
[3:08:58] <s0lidsnekeater> so is it worth it lads?
[3:09:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> Samurai Bloodborne looks rad.

[3:10:04] <+hax_metatron> Battle music and level music, no music at the temple ... interesting
[3:10:04] <+redanimator> has bigger budget lol
[3:10:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> Nioh was kinda lame tbh
[3:10:04] <+Punisher7771> if your a ninja why are you wearing red?
[3:10:05] <rosemon5001> i kinda love the fact the items auto pickup whitout needing to search corpses
[3:10:05] <Storm_Samurai> Why is it better than Nioh
[3:10:05] <%valkuma> thats weird because itseems like a really clumsy version of Nioh
[3:10:06] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Nioh was a Souls hoax
[3:10:07] <Picia000123> I't really not Nioh
[3:10:10] <@Mechz71> I can explain it
[3:10:11] <IntrepidEye> Theres music in general. Even now its playing quietly
[3:10:13] <%mastertwin2> It's got that FROM q u a l i t y
[3:10:14] <+D1ABOL1K> NIoh 2, more like Nioh Boo
[3:10:14] <%Rngiddion> i mean this is nothing like Nioh, Nioh is a diablo game with souls game mechanics
[3:10:14] <korean_random> it looks weirdly similar to Nioh as well
[3:10:15] <$ESP_ROOT> hes gonna pee
[3:10:15] <%H0rnedG0d> needs more Subhuman
[3:10:16] <BigCoffee> Nioh has other issues, like random loot
[3:10:17] <Psyramics> MMO loot is a bad idea in everything, even MMOs
[3:10:17] <%ElenaManetta> YEAH FUCK LiVE ON STREAM

[4:13:24] <nobody12349> Step 2- Have someone yell at you randomly
[4:13:32] <waifoong98> @nobody12349 step 1 - don't play DS Kappa

[4:17:40] <alcors_wisdom> @killface17 well while they were highly trained and there are some documentation of them fighting the monguls fairly well briefly theres also a somewhat hilarious anecdote where the quality of steel in a samurai's sword was so poor that malitia would tie sod and grass to their armor and it would stop their swords

Hey Pat, I've been leveling a DRK lately and it got me thinking what they might change in ShB. Maybe making bld wpn and bld price one button like they did with WAR? I hope they manage to keep up the quest quality in ShB, esp with it being the trailer job.

[5:28:53] <%marvinbrewton25> lmao just the fact thats its a single bright shiny in a dark cave implies backdown

[5:59:42] <+BringBackSempai> thats a bloodbourne mob
[5:59:42] <blue6sub6remnant6> @pepegrillo3 Okay, so early Edo period. My next question, are we allies or enemies with the Tokugawa?
[5:59:44] <Run44forrest> so when do you get the berserk sword
[5:59:46] <BinaryBetrayer> The other games had the excuse of time being convoluted, what's this one's take on enemis respawning and areas being perpetually fucked up?
[5:59:47] <ToastedAeolo> this doesn't feel like a very ninja-like approach lol
[5:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 6 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 24oz (720mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[6:00:01] <%hawk_rush> he needs to use his arm more
[6:00:02] <AlasterAngelo> @BinaryBetrayer bushido magic
[6:00:04] <@JustinianKnight> no dealing with Tokugawa or other major lords
[6:00:05] <SnaKemuho> @binarybetrayer don't worry about it

[6:06:10] <TwistedVerse> @derap41 >:L
[6:06:11] <%0dokuro> Use stealth pat
[6:06:12] <Bouldus> @Smaenus nah i like it better that way :P
[6:06:12] <%nameless_majin> Good lord LUL
[6:06:14] <AllenDeadman> you were, until you got greedy and chocked
[6:06:18] <LixFury> @AngriestPat vaati killed all the minions then called in the npc
[6:06:18] <TheBlankAce> Experiment with fire maybe?
[6:06:21] <koolkid1208> @AngriestPat merchant by the ogre in outskirts sells firecracker
[6:06:24] <+D1ABOL1K> I dont think you got the damage to even kill him
[6:06:24] <%nameless_majin> GIT GUD apatSmug
[6:06:24] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Why don't you try to sneak on him twice?
[6:06:26] <Smaenus> @Bouldus Exposed
[6:06:28] <Mozahar_the_corpse_maker> pat there is a mercant that seals firecrakers
[6:06:32] <%marvinbrewton25> a drunk 500+ pound man of muscle
[6:06:32] <+kknutson4> try fire when he drinks
[6:06:35] <Run44forrest> dont let anyone know you leveled up DEX
[6:06:37] <derap41> I omitted the rape
[6:06:39] <+SolverCODO> You choked and started getting greedy at the end. Rushed him down carelessly and at low posture
[6:06:39] <Deekman> don't talk to NPC until after you've cleared out the ads
[6:06:41] <SnaKemuho> you literally have to play greedy in this, or their stamina just regens
[6:06:42] <b9k9com> You need to take a bit more time in the fights, back off and let your posture bar go down a bit, then re engage. @angriestpat
[6:06:42] <%hawk_rush> Can you still deflect the red-marked attacks?
[6:06:43] <complicatedclarity> liquor is a buff
[6:06:43] <BinaryBetrayer> So this place will be perpetually on fire and there will always be people purging?
[6:06:44] <Smyter> he's a big guy
[6:06:44] <Bouldus> @Smaenus we all do it Kappa
[6:06:53] <%0dokuro> Always
[6:06:54] <T_sarr> hey guys is pat enjoying the game so far?
[6:06:54] <bsip> @xeslana666 only if they are thrust. he cant cointer if they are grabs or sweep
[6:06:57] <xeslana666> red markers are 3 options to select
[6:06:57] <+Shadicara> Legit try the fire he seems very flammable
[6:07:02] <%hawk_rush> Yeah, I think blocking itself is worthless here
[6:07:05] <TwistedVerse> steal the beer and get the buffs for yourself
[6:07:05] <TangledVirus> I think Pat is having the wrong aproach to the game...
[6:07:06] <xeslana666> jump deflect or attack... I think
[6:07:06] <%marvinbrewton25> lmao
[6:07:08] <%0dokuro> lock on!
[6:07:10] <BinaryBetrayer> Drunktards are flammable. I know from experience.
[6:07:13] <%Reizie_Etherealm> "A foe that is hard to defeat, can be made otherwise" So it is written
[6:07:14] <%H0rnedG0d> you cooould sneak attack twice

[6:16:37] <%hntronium> Hey Pat, you got any fire stuff? The big guy uses alcohol right?
[6:16:41] <ivansonic08> How many times has he died?
[6:16:41] <SnaKemuho> resurrecting with half HP is a weird choice
[6:16:42] <majindusto> Man...Pat is bad at this lol
[6:16:43] <%Tarcanist_> you're a ninja, not a samurai! stealth some shit @angriestpat
[6:16:44] <%startadevy> go your own way
[6:16:45] <xeslana666> RAWR RAWR FIGHT THE POWA
[6:16:47] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat Perhaps the game is trying to tell you something with that confetti
[6:16:47] <AlasterAngelo> baby mode is now selectable
[6:16:47] <complicatedclarity> It's alright pat you're big and strong
[6:16:48] <Bouldus> @AngriestPat do bosses regen their health if you jsut run away and stealth attack them again?
[6:16:48] <+PhysicsLB> Use the loaded ass!
[6:16:49] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 43
[6:16:56] <+Shadicara> Yeah he has a big fire arm
[6:17:01] <xeslana666> use items to cheat?
[6:17:02] <ivansonic08> wait 43 times?
[6:17:03] <%ScreamingMeat> PS4 Sekiro's world state is permafucked
[6:17:04] <T_sarr> a gun
[6:17:08] <derap41> Alcohol plus fire = more fire
[6:17:09] <Jrocy247> yes they do
[6:17:09] <televisedrevolting> Big Dumb Bitch Baby Mode Unlocked
[6:17:10] <+GuttlessCashew> i dont understand why he wont use his devil trigger
[6:17:11] <burntwing> Can you play DMC5 was nice to see you decent at a game...
[6:17:11] <%Trinity5> pat you gotta go sicko mode
[6:17:11] <bloodypurpledog> This is the Dark Souls of fromsoft games
[6:17:14] <xeslana666> is there he a mini boss?
[6:17:24] <Bouldus> so you could probably jsut try get a stealth attack of on them twice
[6:17:27] <%startadevy> took a nap, did not know this was happening today
[6:17:27] <%0dokuro> If you stealth you can potentially eliminate one health bar right away, there isn't a down side.
[6:17:31] <%MattDemers> Haha wow @burntwing that's a really dick thing to say
[6:17:34] <BourneWarrior> Do the XXX and the YYY
[6:17:37] <garbageheaphound> try the shinobi hunter man
[6:17:42] <+Tadashi047> The boss of this level is harder
[6:17:46] <derap41> Prepare to fight those guys on the regular later then
[6:17:47] <majindusto> I wish Pat was playing Yakuza BibleThump
[6:17:50] <complicatedclarity> that's just a miniboss zoneSweat
[6:17:50] <sukiyakiwestern> its possible to get a snesk attack off of him
[6:17:51] <T_sarr> an alcoholic being a boss... shits too real
[6:17:52] <braaklyn> What are the top and bottom bars when you were fighting the boss
[6:17:53] <%TheDapperChangeling> TheDapperChangeling subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[6:17:54] <%marvinbrewton25> question is did fromsoft think that hard on fire+alcohol=burning man?
[6:17:56] <SnaKemuho> minibosses in this game genuinely feel harder than normal bosses
[6:17:58] <rytisone> use Sin DT
[6:17:58] <xeslana666> try a tenchu style for a fight?
[6:18:02] <%startadevy> awwww
[6:18:08] <%startadevy> BigPhish
[6:18:08] <+GuttlessCashew> give him the succ
[6:18:09] <Psyramics> Top bar = Their posture, bottom bar is posture
[6:18:09] <+LowDownDirtyGamer> Trying to play a FROM game like a spectacle fighter WCGW?
[6:18:10] <SunsetJack> Man, it feels so easy to miss things.
[6:18:15] <%Trinity5> give him the SUCC
[6:18:16] <%Tarcanist_> ‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ≥‚ñ≥‚ñ≥

[6:18:26] <derap41> Remember to learn of the ultimate ninja batman
[6:18:26] <xeslana666> woweagle eyed
[6:18:27] <$HentaiSenpai9K> That's what I've been saying Stealth kill him twice @angriestpat
[6:18:33] <tacoisgoods> just use royal guard like woolie
[6:18:38] <+Tadashi047> you can skip these guys to save health
[6:18:42] <+Shadicara> give em the axe
[6:18:48] <burntwing> 10 bucks he doesn't even makee it to the boss
[6:18:50] <AllenDeadman> frustration is getting bigger
[6:18:51] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@xeslana666) (warning)
[6:18:52] <%marvinbrewton25> see pat just go in hard and everytime you just wreck them
[6:18:53] <mastermidget23> Speedrun to beat the game so you can use your prosthesis AND your devil bringer.
[6:18:54] <%TheDapperChangeling> Honestly, I can't help but think Sekiro looks..not great. Maybe because I love my RPGs, but..I dunno.
[6:18:57] <rytisone> wasuuuuuup
[6:19:00] <%0dokuro> You got this Pat
[6:19:08] <T_sarr> man this looks easier than bloodborne. Whys he struggling so much
[6:19:10] <%TheDapperChangeling> It just doesn't interest me at all.
[6:19:34] <xeslana666> enemies have unblockables
[6:19:37] <%0dokuro> Nice
[6:19:38] <%marvinbrewton25> see
[6:19:39] <%XzileGaming> do the cool thing though
[6:19:41] <SnaKemuho> @thedapperchangeling there's a lot of focus on stealth, and stealth is very barebones
[6:19:46] <derap41> 20% there
[6:19:50] <%raios22> Is this game parry really parry heavy?
[6:19:52] <%0dokuro> Its really not lol
[6:19:52] <%startadevy> badass matatabi
[6:19:57] <%Edgy_Macaroon> your too aggressive
[6:19:57] <SunsetJack> God no.
[6:19:59] <%marvinbrewton25> this game is not as easy as bloodborne XD
[6:20:05] <%El_Desperad0> Bloodborne is easier
[6:20:09] <+0oki> Is it possible to parry every attack or no?
[6:20:10] <%0dokuro> Slightly
[6:20:10] <xeslana666> stealth does seem barbones that you mention it
[6:20:10] <SunsetJack> This game feels very reaction based.
[6:20:11] <aimlesshealer> How's Pat liking the game so far? I just got here
[6:20:13] <T_sarr> hows the dodge feel?
[6:20:16] <majindusto> Watch Paige be better at it lol
[6:20:21] <complicatedclarity> the difficulty of this game seems pretty nuts
[6:20:22] <HaloPlayerNamedJohn> This game is like the Anti-Pat Souls
[6:20:22] <%wizkid50000> Well he is ANGRIESTPat
[6:20:25] <Cymen90> @aimlesshealer He has been getting rekt but it is amazing
[6:20:27] <+Tadashi047> it is possible to parry any attack that isn;t red
[6:20:32] <%0dokuro> You also had giant freakish weapons to help
[6:20:33] <derap41> Isn't like that with all fromsoft games tho
[6:20:35] <mastermidget23> Is he invincible during the killing blows?
[6:20:36] <sukiyakiwestern> foccus on posture not health
[6:20:41] <%0dokuro> instead of just one katana and a gun arm
[6:20:46] <stirlingw17> enemy line of sight seems pretty aggressive in this game
[6:20:47] <drugbustincat> @AngriestPat Have you ever taken acid or shrooms
[6:20:48] <xeslana666> you can counter red attacks 2
[6:20:49] <garbageheaphound> maybe use the smoke thinga
[6:20:54] <+D1ABOL1K> YES
[6:20:54] <SnaKemuho> @mastermidget23 yeah, like parries and backstabs in Souls
[6:20:55] <kerotuyu> Does attacking an enemy give you back any health, like in Bloodborne? I can't tell, because the health bar is covered.
[6:20:56] <+the_krypto_knight> I feel like if they really wanted you to stealth your back stab wouldn't be so loud it ruptures eardrums
[6:20:57] <%TheDapperChangeling> Honestly, it just seems so barebones compared to most Fromsoft. Like, so simplistic.
[6:21:02] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @T_sarr enemies attack faster than in bloodborne, your dodge is not invincibility frames, and you have to master knowing whether each attack is something to jump, block, or dodge
[6:21:02] <+SolverCODO> Yes, of course.....
[6:21:03] <mr_slaide> Coward it out!
[6:21:03] <sukiyakiwestern> also use the sugar for stealth after killing all the minions and sneak attack
[6:21:05] <silverglove2012> he is huge
[6:21:05] <waifoong98> yes, Posture eleminate whole pip of HP
[6:21:05] <tacoisgoods> be aggressive... b e aggressive
[6:21:10] <+Clundy> Think DS1 poise
[6:21:15] <%marvinbrewton25> Hmm that guy in blue might become a npc later try to keep him alive hint hint

[6:21:22] <derap41> Hide in a box
[6:21:23] <waifoong98> so it is more important after all
[6:21:29] <%aishman> @TheDapperChangeling I dunno, Otogi 1 and 2 ain't exacly the most complex games in the world
[6:21:32] <+D1ABOL1K> LUL
[6:21:35] <%aishman> Nor was Ninja Blade
[6:21:35] <T_sarr> okay that explains it
[6:21:38] <+GuttlessCashew> parry attacks more
[6:21:41] <xeslana666> exciting flute music
[6:21:42] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @T_sarr in Bloodborne you can Souls Cheese easily. In Sekiro you cannot nearly as easily.
[6:21:43] <%TheDapperChangeling> @marvinbrewton25 What's this Fire Emblem shit? Find the non-evil looking guy and keep him alive?
[6:21:46] <b9k9com> focus on not getting hit, not health @angriestpat

[6:35:56] <%aishman> You're keeping track?!
[6:35:59] <+pittbulldogg> just because he's small doesnt mean thats not a mini boss
[6:36:02] <Fenrisulfr_V> Unfortunately, Pat, you can't block thrust attacks.
[6:36:07] <koolkid1208> @AngriestPat mikiri counter makes this fight a joke

[6:36:30] <+zaworldo> He needs to parry
[6:36:31] <derap41> Dark souls rule the closer a boss is to the players size the harder they are
[6:36:37] <Shraquet> Are bosses just like minibosses in this game?
[6:36:39] <corepool> get woolie to coach you

[6:37:32] <Bouldus> the contradicting advice is pretty prime Kappa
[6:37:32] <+reddpop_> Just do it
[6:37:32] <Fenrisulfr_V> Thrust attacks are unblockable. Mikiri counters are for thrust.
[6:37:33] <Deekman> any attack that pops that red symbol is unblockable
[6:37:33] <mr_slaide> Yeah, but there people here are mostly idiots.

[6:37:40] <Run44forrest> pat either go full coward or full dick out
[6:37:42] <SeaReally> thrust counter is good but i dont think you have it
[6:37:42] <future_famous_person> just don't get hit 4Head
[6:37:42] <b9k9com> if you kill him you might win BrokeBack
[6:37:43] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Chat is always wrong
[6:37:43] <+KragPlays> @bighugs You can deflect them though
[6:37:44] <%nameless_majin> LUL
[6:37:44] <Psyramics> its obvious, Pat. block the attacks that can be blocks and don't block the ones that can't. /s
[6:37:44] <Bouldus> just play better Kappa
[6:37:45] <%Edgy_Macaroon> your trying to kill him too fast try dodging and feeling him out
[6:37:48] <Mr_Strut> Just do better
[6:37:48] <Restainly> Don‚Äôt want use resurrection pat effects story and I know u hate that
[6:37:49] <derap41> Its not hard just don't not survive
[6:37:51] <%SilvaChariot0133> Just don't get hit yeah 4Head
[6:37:52] <mr_slaide> Kill him before he kills you.
[6:37:55] <$Billyuppercut0> Jumping is an effective dodging method
[6:37:56] <majindusto> BLOCK...but also DON'T BLOCK!!!
[6:37:57] <%TheDapperChangeling> No, just do it tho
[6:38:00] <rytisone> give controller to Paige to beat it for you
[6:38:01] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat Really watch the poise gauge. Go HARD when they are close
[6:38:02] <complicatedclarity> we're all a bunch of stupid assholes pat, don't trust us zoneLove
[6:38:03] <+Duskysan> The movement in this game looks so dope
[6:38:04] <captainthunderwolf> @Psyramics To be fair, that actually is the "obvious" logic.
[6:38:05] <%ScreamingMeat> Deflect or dodge perilous stabs, jump perilous swipes
[6:38:06] <+zaworldo> @Restainly death affects the story, not resurrecting
[6:38:07] <%0dokuro> Poor shield peoples
[6:38:08] <Wobuzhidao> Just red parry Chun's super Pat
[6:38:08] <+Kairi__> Backseat gaming for this game is borderline useless, I think.
[6:38:10] <stabbityrabbit> @AngriestPat I like the fact that everyone in chat is apparently experts on a game that they most likely haven't played.
[6:38:11] <MeowmereArt> @Kairi__ support ur boy pat cause streaming is his main thing FeelsBadMan
[6:38:11] <sukiyakiwestern> hikiri counter :(
[6:38:11] <%hntronium> Well Pat, you block the blockable attacks and don't try and block the unblockable attacks. Its that simple! Also do the run without getting hit
[6:38:11] <+Katyusha94> Drop your sheild
[6:38:13] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat I have noticed that after reading about guarding improving posture regen, you still immediately drop your guard. Something to work on, mayhaps? rooThink
[6:38:14] <T_sarr> man that coin shit is SO bad
[6:38:16] <silverglove2012> wait maybe range vs spear
[6:38:19] <aimlesshealer> Have we seen Paige play a stealth game before?
[6:38:19] <captainthunderwolf> The unblockable attacks even have a literal visual warning on-screen.
[6:38:31] <+zaworldo> @stabbityrabbit it literally TOLD him to deflect it when he first ran into the guy
[6:38:32] <%TheDapperChangeling> Enemies don't respawn huh...
[6:38:33] <%hntronium> Maybe stealthing the monk would be better?
[6:38:34] <%SilvaChariot0133> Hoist thine barricade :^)
[6:38:35] <derap41> We need 7 perpendicular pats all crossing at a 90 degree angle
[6:38:36] <+GuttlessCashew> backseating is for fun not advice
[6:38:37] <T_sarr> he looks blind

[6:39:11] <%0dokuro> shuriken to reset his frames
[6:39:12] <SnaKemuho> that one skill that deflects thrusts is the best thing for this
[6:39:20] <Ninjagregory98> Stealth him twice?
[6:39:27] <%TheDapperChangeling> Ok, now switch to cavalier to shred his guard.
[6:39:29] <%hntronium> run away!
[6:39:31] <+Papafleish> dude how long have you been on this fight

[6:40:36] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat good work, but remember you have a grappling hook for a reason

[6:40:38] <+sleepwalk1221> God that looks so satisfying

[6:40:41] <rytisone> Sekiro: The Quest For Anal Beads
[6:40:41] <derap41> That was just one of the shinobi hunters
[6:40:44] <$valriot> I love how Pats trying to use his katana like its the fuckin Dragonbone Smasher
[6:40:45] <Crankthulhu> Shocked axe attack doesn't do more poise damage
[6:40:47] <%0dokuro> I love it
[6:40:49] <Run44forrest> bro was just looking at the flowers
[6:40:50] <SnaKemuho> @allendeadman there is and it's the best skill in the game
[6:40:51] <+GuttlessCashew> jump off cliffs more
[6:40:55] <SeaReally> yes there is a counter for thrusts
[6:40:59] <koolkid1208> @AngriestPat there is a skill that lets you deflect the thrust attacks!
[6:41:00] <%ScreamingMeat> You can wait on the death screen until they are far enough away for your Resurrection to not alert them and then stealth attack them.
[6:41:03] <Load_Complete> Hey so what's the general conses on this game?
[6:41:04] <+Kairi__> ÊªÖÊÆ∫ÔºÅÊ≠ª„Çì„Å≠ÔºÅ
[6:41:05] <Run44forrest> so pat you plan on finishing the game today?
[6:41:06] <garbageheaphound> dont forget the pagoda
[6:41:07] <b9k9com> now you only have to fight the 2nd and 3rd shinobi hunter ^_^ @angriestpat
[6:41:13] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat The biggest change is the lack of stamina. No reason to back off or drop the shield.
[6:41:18] <MeowmereArt> @Restainly it does not matter if you resurrect or not, as long as you die you spread dragonrot. you could not res at all and you die enough time you still spread it.
[6:41:19] <Crankthulhu> @Load_Complete HARD
[6:41:25] <%0dokuro> Carps
[6:41:25] <aimlesshealer> @Cymen90 I was wondering about that. That's interesting
[6:41:26] <Restainly> I don‚Äôt even know what a boss and what‚Äôs a mini boss
[6:41:27] <%graffitisamurai> Does this game penalize resurrection??
[6:41:29] <sukiyakiwestern> im about 4 hours further. this game is a boss rush basically
[6:41:29] <%aishman> I think cause they want to have a huge focus on blocking, which multiple blocks does the most poise damage.
[6:41:30] <%TheDapperChangeling> @Load_Complete That it's Fromsoft, so good. However, I'm curious of how it actually is. Looks fairly boring to me. :\
[6:41:40] <T_sarr> anyone knows how long this game is?
[6:41:44] <captainthunderwolf> @Cymen90 Or rather, they shifted the reason to stop blocking to your on poise bar, which is a really creative decision.
[6:41:50] <Nina96> PogChamp
[6:41:52] <%ScreamingMeat> You can wait on the death screen until they walk far enough away for your Resurrection to not alert them and then stealth attack them.
[6:41:53] <Patzzki217> noice

[7:12:49] <lostvayne91> and the shinobi hunter?
[7:12:53] <TaurusOxford> @Restainly I don't think that's true.
[7:12:55] <%TheDapperChangeling> The big issue I'm seeing with Sekiro is how do you make this replayable? No builds, no branching paths, and the combat doesn't appear to be good enough to justify repeat playthroughs like DMC
[7:13:04] <Cymen90> @lostvayne91 Got him
[7:13:05] <SpaceKingVeeg> flip goes go over sweeps, learned that from the lobos streams
[7:13:08] <%Ninestempest> tfw pat couldn't dodge that arrow <_<
[7:13:09] <lostvayne91> sweet
[7:13:12] <%startadevy> KAPOW
[7:13:13] <Hydrapissed> no death runs I guess
[7:13:13] <zakor1138> @aimlesshealer They are basically Charmanders
[7:13:15] <Ner234> @TheDapperChangeling It has multiple endings
[7:13:18] <Deekman> @TheDapperChangeling it's fun so you'll want to replay it
[7:13:27] <orphancrippler_> didnt knoe pats mom was an enemy type
[7:13:29] <%hawk_rush> @TheDapperChangeling Same way games like Uncharted offer replayability
[7:13:30] <Cymen90> @TheDapperChangeling There are actually builds. He has just not opened that screen in a long time
[7:13:36] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Dats a thicc boi
[7:13:37] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines 2 announcement got leaked
[7:13:40] <+zetaplus> @TheDapperChangeling why would a game need any of that to be replayable
[7:13:45] <+sergeantsuperbeast> hitbox porn
[7:13:46] <Ner234> @TheDapperChangeling Also not everthing needs to have crazy replayaablity
[7:13:52] <+CausticLich> is pat just not doing a build?
[7:14:00] <Deekman> @Flambage just saw that! Super excited!
[7:14:03] <+Caridinn> So is this game like every dex users dream?
[7:14:04] <Load_Complete> those dodges we're pretty neat pat, well fought there.
[7:14:05] <Cymen90> @TheDapperChangeling Well there are skills. But really, since when do you need variability to replay something?
[7:14:06] <silverira> I see that fat evil is something still alive and strong in gamees
[7:14:07] <complicatedclarity> pat got gooder
[7:14:07] <Hydrapissed> cause ur am is strong
[7:14:11] <SnaKemuho> there are no builds, just abilities you gradually unlock
[7:14:13] <T_sarr> god is afraid of horny men

[7:14:16] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 7h 14m.

[7:22:16] <%Reizie_Etherealm> She seems pretty alright as a first boss
[7:22:32] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Maybe it's because I'm not actually playing it, but a lot of enemy moves seem obvious to avoid
[7:22:35] <+maxamillion629> Shinobi tools
[7:22:36] <%king_wragles> I think that's pretty good if the player can barely see the wire

[7:23:21] <SnaKemuho> @salvation122 stamina analogue for blocking, attacks are free
[7:23:24] <$SGrim> I mean her style's cool, but if you ever get to the area before her, she's fucked. rooShrug

One thing he says often in his "Which Ninja" series is that Real Ninja wore blue uniforms and they used Kunai and Shuriken for distraction purposes almost exclusively. And never for killing.

[7:35:27] <%Townspoon> @AngriestPat is there somewhere else you can put your cam so we can see your lifebar?
[7:35:27] <%PlainSimpleTailor> From what I'm seeing, the game seems cool, just not fun. Might consider getting a refund before it unlocks on Steam for me
[7:35:28] <Ner234> This granny has no chill LUL
[7:35:32] <%Superstarsage> I wonder if you can light her, and by proxy her wires on fire
[7:35:35] <Deekman> When she summons her ghosts just run all the way to the other end of the arena and she'll recall them
[7:35:49] <Deekman> You don't NEED seeds
[7:35:50] <pshuuu> @EdibleNewb you can delay fighting her a bit but the other bosses arent really any easier
[7:35:53] <SnaKemuho> yeah, maybe kill the horse and get an upgrade

[7:36:42] <aimlesshealer> What about it looks unfun?
[7:36:43] <%trnzero> I do find it interesting how the first stage "granny" DIES so it resets your rez for stage 2
[7:36:45] <+AXL808> is she just kicking Pat's blade away when he attacks?
[7:36:46] <T_sarr> gameplay looks great but otherwise it feels a bit hollow
[7:36:47] <llamington> its there like a tiny baby mode for infants?

[7:38:44] <%TheDapperChangeling> @Dutchpotato Well, it is Pat, so, like, 4 hours of that is fiddling with the menus, then opening the game.

[7:44:12] <+ciprofloxacin> greedy
[7:44:14] <Load_Complete> TRailer was clearly "GAMEPLAY" but it looks very bioshock
[7:44:15] <%TheDapperChangeling> Got it. Thanks guys, will watch the trailer in a bit
[7:44:19] <SunsetJack> I wonder if it skips the first phase of the fight if you use the seed since she is an illusion technically.
[7:44:22] <%PlainSimpleTailor> What if their were some secret way to hook up to her and just stab her to negate the fight LUL
[7:44:23] <arcaderabbit48> Okay fine, maybe it is happening. I just hope it lives up to the hype, and has a smoother dev time than the last game.
[7:44:28] <complicatedclarity> destroy that woman like paige destroys mustard
[7:44:29] <DSD24> I wonder if 2 is going to be modern day

[7:57:30] <stabbityrabbit> Sekiro is the Dark Souls of Bloodborne.
[7:57:32] <%superb_superbia> oh I didn't know you could write a message with your subscription
[7:57:33] <+Will_The_Soulless> Pat do you feel like with the difficulty of this that its more a learning curve and understanding controls or does it kinda feel a bit bullshit in some cases?
[7:57:44] <%superb_superbia> I don't use Twitch very often. How does it work?
[7:57:44] <%TheDapperChangeling> Fucking DRK hype
[7:57:45] <kingdudeby> Vampire the Masquerade 2 has been announced.
[7:57:48] <%ScreamingMeat> If Bloodborne kicks your ass, and Dark Souls kicks your shit in, the Sekiro must kick your teeth out through your ass
[7:57:52] <cavefishes> Bloodborne is the Sekiro of Dark Souls
[7:57:55] <%TheDapperChangeling> Frey best girl
[7:57:58] <b9k9com> You gotta thank Kakashi for teaching you the chidori, it really fucked up that horse Kappa @angriestpat

[7:58:04] <+aspirationdeath> So, Vampire the Masquerade 2 is happening... Whos excited?
[7:58:20] <Nina96> ye
[7:58:21] <%Ninestempest> Yes!
[7:58:23] <malletman241> wish they'd shown gameplay
[7:58:23] <%Salvation122> Yup
[7:58:23] <%starotter70> Yup
[7:58:23] <%TheDapperChangeling> Yep
[7:58:24] <Dragon_Batman> Yea
[7:58:24] <%superb_superbia> yes
[7:58:25] <lizard0tm> Ye
[7:58:25] <aimlesshealer> Absolutely
[7:58:26] <%ElenaManetta> DOZENS of us
[7:58:26] <Omega1180> yes
[7:58:26] <%RageKingDomo> yup
[7:58:28] <+solzan2000> yea
[7:58:28] <%hntronium> HOW MANY DEATHS IS THAT AGAINST LADY BUTTERFLY huh pat
[7:58:28] <%PlainSimpleTailor> yep
[7:58:29] <%Ninestempest> Yup! First is hardest for me!
[7:58:31] <+AngriestAngryArtist> Demon Souls was pretty hard
[7:58:34] <%CreakySkelly> nice
[7:58:35] <lizard0tm> Nah, Bloodborne was the hardest for me
[7:58:35] <lolerez> DOZENS
[7:58:38] <aimlesshealer> This seems like a Souls game made for Souls players
[7:58:38] <majindusto> VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE: BLOODLINES 2 woo!!!
[7:58:39] <%RageKingDomo> that was the hardest lmao
[7:58:39] <%starotter70> Great
[7:58:39] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Bloodborne is the only one I finished
[7:58:42] <robohorse8000> "Not a souls game"
[7:58:43] <%TheDapperChangeling> Honestly, DS2 was hardest for me, which is weird.
[7:58:44] <Nina96> ds2 first than the rest were fine
[7:58:46] <+Will_The_Soulless> Demons Souls had a lot of problems
[7:58:46] <ShichiNoBushi> Which WoD system is V:tM 2 based off of? Old as "The Masquerade" implies?
[7:58:50] <Dragon_Batman> Demon souls was pretty fucked when I first tried it
[7:58:55] <Neo_Kaiser> Demon Souls wasn't that tough. I beat the first 5 bosses on my first try.
[7:58:55] <+Will_The_Soulless> But some of the parts in Demons Souls are bullshit
[7:58:56] <Habblewater> Yeah kinda...
[7:58:59] <%XzileGaming> the timeline has overlapped
[7:59:02] <dickbuttwoman> The things that make it hard is the jank you don't expect because it's jank
[7:59:11] <+Will_The_Soulless> I hated the dragon at the end of Demons Souls
[7:59:12] <%TheDapperChangeling> DeS was a joke, DS was meh, DS3 was a joke, but then DS2..
[7:59:14] <%hntronium> Nioh?
[7:59:15] <+AngriestAngryArtist> I think Nioh's the hardest shit LOL
[7:59:16] <Run44forrest> DS3 was the hardest for me
[7:59:17] <aimlesshealer> Savor that feeling
[7:59:20] <dickbuttwoman> Like "Will my character stand on that? I don't know"
[7:59:23] <MONSTR_UwU> is this character action now?
[7:59:24] <+AngriestAngryArtist> in higher difficulty is some bullshit
[7:59:30] <sosuke5> Is it a game to make Plauge upset?
[7:59:30] <b9k9com> What is Nioh?
[7:59:34] <%ScreamingMeat> Looks like it plays a lot different from DS and BB but plays similarly enough to fuck with Souls veterans
[7:59:39] <%TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat go back and play Bloodborne right after you finish this game.
[7:59:40] <Nina96> @MONSTR_UwU kinda
[7:59:40] <cavefishes> sekiro unlocks in 9 minutes for me! i'm hype
[7:59:47] <%starotter70> Big tiddy plant girl
[7:59:49] <+AngriestAngryArtist> Nioh is the Team Ninja Equivalent of the souls game.
[7:59:56] <Aji__> If im buying it on one platform, pc for sure?
[8:00:04] <b9k9com> ahhh gotcha, thanks @angriestangryartist
[8:00:05] <MachigattaLT> @AngriestPat any opinions on vampire the masquerade 2 being confirmed?
[8:00:06] <waifoong98> LUL
[8:00:08] <%El_Desperad0> true
[8:00:12] <waifoong98> so git gud Kappa
[8:00:13] <+BoltWarden> makes me think of Ninja Gaiden on original xbox a bit
[8:00:15] <Nina96> whats with the plant girl all of a sudden?
[8:00:16] <aimlesshealer> How many licks to the center of a Sekiro pop?
[8:00:16] <Dragon_Batman> that is true LUL
[8:00:17] <OkamiDude15> Tig ol biddy plant gorl yamach1Hypers
[8:00:20] <metaphase72> as someone who hasn't been here much, why do you have a picture of steve buscemi in the background?
[8:00:23] <Run44forrest> stopped playing nioh at the second boss that attack that stopped you from moving was bs
[8:00:27] <%El_Desperad0> To be fair, that's cause you kept dying
[8:00:30] <%TheDapperChangeling> Yeah, I'll definantly rent it, and depending on how it feels, move to a buy
[8:00:39] <%aishman> Oh there's english VA?!
