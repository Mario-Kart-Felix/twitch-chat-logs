[0:02:33] <@lewdskeletor13> He’s doing a new route
[0:02:35] <tri3dgE027> Glad he is doing the best regarded story-line path fot 3H
[0:02:37] <+aivalera> @itsdeans he changed because he heard that path should be played last

[0:03:32] <%joylent_blue> yeah i think playing BL first is probably good
[0:03:38] <Xxx_wiiuboss_xxx> Is this your second play through?
[0:03:39] <tri3dgE027> BL is always recommended to be played last, since it is the longest out of the 4

[0:03:48] <@lewdskeletor13> He’s already played this game before

[0:04:52] <tri3dgE027> @joylent_blue Imma die on this hill, BL has the best plot progression and should be played last
[0:04:58] <ItsDeans> Man, I'm glad I get to see Pat play FE3H.
[0:05:06] <bustawof> Church of Seiros octoFRE
[0:05:19] <$Tuskor13> I don't think BL should be played last I think the order is up to preference

[0:05:29] <%Gimmpy2143> apatHoldon @lewdskeletor13 Edelgard is a fem byleth romance option im pretty sure
[0:05:30] <%starotter70> Oh?
[0:05:32] <ItsDeans> If you guys garden enough you can get Ingrids strength up pretty high with the random stat boosters.
[0:05:35] <%joylent_blue> tri3dgE027 i mean i agree, BL is my favorite so far, but its shorter than the other two if we're talking mission count i think? havne't finished BE yet
[0:05:35] <CastellanVon> Ingrid has enough strength as long as you Wyvern Lord. As with everyone else.

[0:11:22] <%deviljhojho94> fake gamer boy
[0:11:23] <%joylent_blue> Maddening is fucking nuts
[0:11:23] <%supersugoisenpai1> Killing is fine, as long as you're having fun
[0:11:25] <Sir_Walrus> Do maddening coward
[0:11:26] <%SolverCODO> aw-ree
[0:11:28] <%BoboDaHobo> rewinds make the whole game casual but it's fun
[0:11:37] <%AncelDeLambert> we say "normal mode" but what we really mean is "the self-assurance and relief of pretending it's normal mode as we refuse to lose a single character because death is failure" moe
[0:11:40] <+RogueInfinity> What chapter are you on? I don't wanna spoil myself

[0:11:43] <%Berb64> le cat
[0:11:44] <laguerrilha> The french will rule the world, until the surrender it
[0:11:45] <+Grayhammatter> rewinds are not needed at all
[0:11:45] <+aivalera> Classic’s not that bad though. It’s not as nuts as awakening/fates.

[0:16:12] <@lewdskeletor13> Lurkers are cool
[0:16:14] <%joylent_blue> Dedue as a unit is fantastic, he has the personality of a cinder block tho
[0:16:18] <+Crumpington> Blue Lions was definitely my favorite and had the best story IMO.

[0:16:40] <%StaceMcGate> I've completed the 3 routes, Deer gives the most insight into what is going on but Black Eagles was most emotional compelling. Blue Lions is in the middle
[0:16:44] <tri3dgE027> @Crumpington Yo! Another brethren of the court
[0:16:45] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat I've only seen one Skit from the REMake 2 fandub and it was pretty funny.

[0:18:29] <+MrN64> @AngriestPat What did you think of the Black Eagles route? Assuming you finished it
[0:18:30] <%StaceMcGate> As a Warmaster my Byleth has like an 80% crit rate
[0:18:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I wanted to be a Fist Mage but game wouldn't let me :(
[0:18:36] <+Grayhammatter> what kinda doofus does automatic?
[0:18:39] <kindashagg> Already sweating and screaming
[0:18:40] <%Josef_Stryker> If u get far enough, u gonna make Felix a Weeb?
[0:18:42] <%mh9s> put that juice in your students
[0:18:47] <moonmeh> spray that teaching jiuce on the students
[0:18:47] <worldbrand> I don't like teachy juice
[0:18:49] <%AncelDeLambert> teachy juice, eh?
[0:18:53] <+aivalera> That works
[0:18:53] <+Grayhammatter> spears though
[0:18:55] <Sir_Walrus> @angriestpat don’t worry 95% of fire emblem fans make the wrong decisions anyway
[0:18:57] <xtremegamer80> That can get you arrested
[0:18:59] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Ive heard talk of this game, first time getting eyes on it for real, all i see is fan art and mcdonalds stuff and its super confusing
[0:19:00] <$Tuskor13> @Sphincter_Spelunker just get someone to A in fists and give them aura gauntlets theyre fists that do magic dm
[0:19:00] <%joylent_blue> prioritize bow for now imo
[0:19:03] <%joylent_blue> get that close counter
[0:19:04] <+Crumpington> Boooow
[0:19:05] <+aivalera> Dedue’s the shit don’t worry about him.
[0:19:14] <kanodin> ashe starts as an archer
[0:19:14] <tri3dgE027> Not sure if @AngriestPat noticed, but Male Byleth recently had his voice re-dubbed on the recent update
[0:19:15] <Sir_Walrus> Ashe is bad lol
[0:19:15] <+MrN64> You should try to get Lysithea for those Dark Spikes :)
[0:19:15] <wondersloth07> teach only girls, be that teacher
[0:19:17] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat Teach him to work that pole!
[0:19:17] <%StaceMcGate> I benched Ashe for my playthrough because he is just the dullest person in this game, even more so than Ignatz
[0:19:17] <Roz_Lynd> this game is so confusing to me
[0:19:19] <+haystacks89> Everything into FIst
[0:19:19] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm led to understand there's a lot of wiggle room for bullshit
[0:19:21] <moonmeh> dudes an archer
[0:19:21] <%StripesUltimateEdition> he wants to be a bowboy
[0:19:21] <+Grayhammatter> pat sounds baked
[0:19:23] <%mh9s> teach him how to handle that lance
[0:19:23] <+aivalera> You can do lance later. Clear the class in front of him first.
[0:19:24] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Good call
[0:19:29] <%VioletHeart> Lances if you want his hidden skill. Otherwise bows,
[0:19:29] <%AncelDeLambert> ewwww, english voices
[0:19:30] <bruno_silv0> long gone are my days of having so few teaching points, new game+ is the best
[0:19:33] <+ScatFace> he's a good boy knight or wyvern rider
[0:19:36] <%noobpsyboticus> pat when are you going to fuck these children
[0:19:36] <+Crumpington> Don't talk to Ashe like that
[0:19:37] <%supersugoisenpai1> Ashe is a good boy
[0:19:39] <%joylent_blue> the english voices are great shush

[0:20:05] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Slyvain makes for a good Dark Knight
[0:20:06] <malesin_01> he wants to be a wyvern lord

[0:23:31] <ooblag> As a general rule, keep your "support" skill (riding, flying, etc.) one level beneath your primary weapon
[0:23:34] <%joylent_blue> a Fire spell so she can burn the infidels at the stake
[0:23:37] <DownPlayTwitch> D:

[0:43:48] <%Divryne> Too early.
[0:43:48] <CastellanVon> Not until you need them.
[0:43:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @gespenst25 Saw a bit of that. Not quite there yet. Figured
[0:43:50] <%starotter70> Not enough
[0:43:50] <%aivalera> Not yet
[0:43:51] <Sir_Walrus> Not yet
[0:43:53] <Vigonept> nust buy em to have em
[0:43:53] <%gespenst25> Eh, you never really run out.
[0:43:54] <%joylent_blue> you need BEGINNER seals
[0:43:55] <pectusumbra> too early right now. just beginner seals if any
[0:43:56] <DopeyDragon> not yet though
[0:43:56] <%VioletHeart> Not yet. You won't need them for ages.
[0:43:57] <Doodle_Taco> Too early
[0:43:57] <+Grayhammatter> but no
[0:44:00] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat you will not have enough
[0:44:00] <%miguelrod777> cant use them or a while
[0:44:01] <%rubbishbinge> You only have lvl 4 babies bruh
[0:44:03] <ChineseNininga> yes cause they restock every month
[0:44:04] <xtremegamer80> Yep
[0:44:04] <ooblag> No need, they become infinite in the shop by the team you need a bunch
[0:44:05] <%VioletHeart> You'll have tons by then, Pat.
[0:44:06] <%GabeSweetMan> Restocks ALWAYS BUY
[0:44:06] <%aivalera> Nopr
[0:44:06] <garrulousAuthority> you don't need them
[0:44:07] <%Kataguro> You can buy them freely later
[0:44:07] <%VioletHeart> Don't worry.
[0:44:09] <+StoicMoogle> They do restock per month
[0:44:11] <%Divryne> They become infinite later.
[0:44:11] <%aivalera> Don't worry about it
[0:44:13] <%GabeSweetMan> You can just grind money.
[0:44:15] <%Divryne> Don't worry.
[0:44:17] <%bread_assassin> @AngriestPat Buy hand axes and javelins for ranged options and let your units counter archers on enemy phase.
[0:44:18] <Vigonept> they become infinite later on
[0:44:22] <+burritocheetos> dont worry about it
[0:44:23] <+StoicMoogle> Just focus on beginner seals
[0:44:24] <%Quigsies> They become infinite
[0:44:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> You're on baby easy mode and can grind later
[0:44:28] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> bullion
[0:44:30] <DopeyDragon> >grinding in fire emblem
[0:44:30] <+conradical> they'll be infinininite later
[0:44:31] <%joylent_blue> @AngriestPat you will get 5 beginner seals when someone reaches lvl 5, buy the necessary amount on top of that
[0:44:31] <pectusumbra> yes but unless you plan on hyper grinding, usually you'll get each character like 1 intermidiate class
[0:44:32] <%Divryne> You get a ton from battles anyways.
[0:44:44] <ooblag> Yeah, you can always BITCH OUT and grind cash, seeing as you already bitched out of Classic
[0:44:44] <%GabeSweetMan> Either way works.
[0:44:46] <%starotter70> Yes, wait no, but may- no, wait
[0:44:52] <Sir_Walrus> @angriestpat you’re playing on babby mode nothing you do will fuck you over

[0:45:07] <%aivalera> Buy low speed characters shield
[0:45:11] <%Divryne> LUL
[0:45:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> nah, just tired
[0:45:16] <+Grayhammatter> yes, you are, but no
[0:45:18] <%Meidolaon> Almost Woolie'd LUL
[0:45:20] <%Dr00_PhD> you are but we love you anyway
[0:45:29] <%starotter70> It's fine
[0:45:30] <%Kataguro> Javelin are ranged
[0:45:31] <bruno_silv0> how did pat play this up to chapter 8?
[0:45:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Javelins are for throwies
[0:45:36] <%aivalera> You're also gonna want Dim to be good with swords a bit
[0:45:37] <%tyler274> get rid of your iron shit
[0:45:38] <CastellanVon> very slowly
[0:45:44] <%Meidolaon> Iron is fiiiiiine
[0:45:49] <%Kirby_Sauce> look at these noble assholes syced to go murder some peasants
[0:45:52] <%Jolnir> isnt fire emblem an rpg?
[0:45:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> iron is fine
[0:45:54] <%Quigsies> Iron is fine for now, work towards steel
[0:45:55] <Roz_Lynd> heavier shit helps people master shit faster
[0:45:55] <%GabeSweetMan> Iron is less weight so more hits.
[0:45:57] <%miguelrod777> for him yes
[0:45:58] <%joylent_blue> you don't need to upgrade yet
[0:45:58] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat anything other than iron is overkill right now
[0:45:59] <DopeyDragon> If anything you should get training weapons
[0:45:59] <Quietshun13> steel is heavy
[0:46:00] <%Kataguro> Iron is fine. Dimitri hits for a billion anyway
[0:46:01] <+Grayhammatter> pat, you might just want to turn in now, you sound super tired
[0:46:01] <+conradical> pat, since you're on normal and will likely just grind out money and levels later, literally nothing matters
[0:46:02] <Roz_Lynd> 'least that's how it was in the original
[0:46:03] <%supersugoisenpai1> Iron+ is better mostly
[0:46:04] <%Jolnir> dynasty warriors empires the anime
[0:46:04] <%faeron93> stop backseating
[0:46:04] <Onmi_Khaos> Steel is stronger but heavier.
[0:46:08] <%GabeSweetMan> It's a trade off.
[0:46:08] <CastellanVon> Iron is basically the best weapons. Whatever lets you double or not get doubled.
[0:46:15] <%aivalera> The backseat-gaming is strong with this one
[0:46:16] <Onmi_Khaos> Fae he's LITERALLY asking chat
[0:46:19] <%VioletHeart> My recommendation is "never buy steel weapons ever"
[0:46:23] <Sir_Walrus> @angriestpat Stick with iron until the last part of the game like everyone else
[0:46:27] <%joylent_blue> Javelin for Ingrid is great because she can Enemy Phase counter mages
[0:46:33] <+chaumiester> Wait, I thought you were only gonna play this game for yourself.... and not stream it cuz audience sucks fun for this game
[0:46:34] <%Kataguro> Javelins for all
[0:46:42] <%aivalera> You're gonna wnat to give annette an ax jic
[0:46:42] <%GabeSweetMan> There's every option even in how you want to min-max. The most important thing to remember that there is no right answer. Only wrong ones.
[0:46:43] <%iwishthiswasicq> Steel is good for already slow as shit units, especially since the high usage lets you use arts more.
[0:46:45] <ooblag> Training and Steel both have more uses than Iron. Iron is kind of the shittiest of the three early weapon tiers
[0:46:48] <%joylent_blue> DOODOO

[0:47:10] <%Dr00_PhD> Class level
[0:47:10] <DopeyDragon> @AngriestPat Make sure to check weapon weights and to make sure steel isn't too heavy for your units.
[0:47:11] <%Kataguro> She maxed her class out
[0:47:11] <%joylent_blue> thats their class mastery
[0:47:12] <%aivalera> Class mastery?

[0:47:31] <Roz_Lynd> she's a professional commoner
[0:47:32] <%GabeSweetMan> Buy 3 Beginner Seals
[0:47:32] <kanodin> when a class maxes out it unlocks a bonus skill

[0:47:33] <$Tuskor13> The Mercedes Meter
[0:47:35] <ooblag> It just unlocks a (usually not great) skill
[0:47:36] <%VioletHeart> Class mastery means they unlocked a class skill. That's when you should upgrade them to a new class.
[0:47:37] <%miguelrod777> give her a beginner class
[0:47:38] <+StoicMoogle> Class mastered. Give her a new class
[0:47:40] <%tyler274> you equip abilities in the item menu
[0:47:41] <%king_wragles> Mercedes is the best Mercedes that ever Mercedes
[0:47:43] <Dracozombie5792> Class exp is maxed

[0:48:00] <nevan0> mercedes meter,,,

[0:48:03] <%aivalera> Reclass her when you can
[0:48:05] <CastellanVon> Oh that makes sense since she is the oldest.
[0:48:05] <%starotter70> I don't think he can reclass yet
[0:48:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> not until level 5
[0:48:13] <+BIumen> not available
[0:48:14] <%BestTeaMaker> level 5
[0:48:14] <%GabeSweetMan> Ah Brain, #1 cause of death.
[0:48:14] <%Crumpington> Mercedes is really old
[0:48:15] <pectusumbra> you need to do a promotion first
[0:48:17] <ooblag> Anyone level 5 and above can reclass
[0:48:18] <%bread_assassin> Not until Lv. 5
[0:48:18] <+StoicMoogle> Inventory > Reclass

[0:48:25] <%gespenst25> Need to be level 5
[0:48:26] <%VioletHeart> Gotta promote her but you can't do it now.
[0:48:27] <%Meidolaon> She's a year older than Byleth LUL
[0:48:27] <%Kataguro> You have to do the mastery exam. Not available yet
[0:48:36] <Sir_Walrus> He was also playing babby mode so he could do whatever he wanted and not lose
[0:48:36] <ShichiNoBushi> Pat is suffering from a slow, persistent stroke.
[0:48:42] <Onmi_Khaos> How do you master the class without levelling to at least 5?!
[0:48:44] <%aivalera> Pro-tip @AngriestPat always ALWAYS master your class abilities. They can be ludicrously good
[0:48:45] <%BestTeaMaker> pat brain no work well
[0:48:45] <CastellanVon> It's time for everyone's first murder!
[0:48:46] <%starotter70> I want Dmitri to say WHO SAID THAT after the timeskip
[0:48:55] <%Meidolaon> Pat is suffering from balls overwashing
[0:48:57] <Roz_Lynd> she's been a commoner a long time
[0:48:58] <%GabeSweetMan> Healers max out their classes REAL fast from healing.
[0:49:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Onmi_Khaos Use abilities a lot
[0:49:01] <tri3dgE027> Pat's blood-stream is slowly being converted to be powered only by Red-Bull
[0:49:04] <%joylent_blue> eh, some class abilities are effectively useless
[0:49:04] <Onmi_Khaos> SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT THE TIMESKIP
[0:49:10] <%Kataguro> SURE ARE
[0:49:13] <Bailey__gaming> Hey pat & elmo and maybe spooky ghost Paige
[0:49:15] <%gespenst25> @Onmi_Khaos It's got nothing to do with being able to promote, it's just about getting enough class exp

[0:49:51] <%BestTeaMaker> no
[0:49:53] <Sir_Walrus> @angriestpat don’t always master the classes for the abilities. Some of them suck and aren’t worth it. Like the Defiant family of abilities

[0:50:29] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat did you finish the shadow keep campaign?
[0:50:30] <%VioletHeart> @Sir_Walrus Although at that point you probably should have picked a different class rather than half-assing it.

[0:52:57] <%BestTeaMaker> the prozd video is relevant
[0:52:58] <garrulousAuthority> Now I'm motivated!
[0:52:58] <%joylent_blue> LOVE YOU FELIX
[0:52:58] <%gespenst25> It's amazing how bloodthirsty Hufflepuff are.
[0:52:59] <%RubberFistFight> YOU DEFEATED
[0:53:00] <Onmi_Khaos> show me your Motivation
[0:53:01] <%GabeSweetMan> STR and DEF on same level is great.
[0:53:01] <%VioletHeart> Man, I'm excited for folks like Dedue and Annette to get busted like they always do. They're so damn strong.
[0:53:01] <%Josef_Stryker> THE EDGE
[0:53:02] <pectusumbra> hey Vergil
[0:53:02] <%miguelrod777> VERGIL
[0:53:03] <%Quigsies> I looooove him
[0:53:04] <%aivalera> EDGING
[0:53:05] <%Kataguro> P O W E R
[0:53:07] <betrayed_llama> Shut up sasuke
[0:53:07] <Doodle_Taco> SCUM
[0:53:09] <%starotter70> WEAK DANTE
[0:53:09] <DopeyDragon> Felix is really fucking good
[0:53:12] <%aivalera> I NEED MORE POWER
[0:53:14] <BunnyEmperor> Felix is MOTIVATED
[0:53:14] <xtremegamer80> @BestTeaMaker I THINK THAT ENEMY GOT THE POINT
[0:53:16] <3xgilly> EDGEGUARD
[0:53:18] <%Divryne> My little edgelord can't possible be this cute.
[0:53:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I was thinking Sasuke but Virgil is pretty spot on
[0:53:27] <%Wynzler> His voice is even super similar to Vergil
[0:53:28] <%miguelrod777> i always recruit him hes a beast
[0:53:30] <%tyler274> you cant subdue the dedue
[0:53:30] <Galaxyman64> yeah the blue lions seem WAY cooler with murder than the other houses
[0:53:32] <%BestTeaMaker> geez, @xtremegamer80 do you think he got the point?
[0:53:38] <%aivalera> If only someone said pick a god and pray
[0:53:38] <+Nomicro4u> Something is going to go horrible wrong I can feel it
[0:53:39] <%GabeSweetMan> Who is the stronger Edgelord? Felix or Edelgard?
[0:53:44] <%Kataguro> Felix
[0:53:46] <KingRipoff1> hes already double attacking on enemies felix is so strong
[0:53:47] <Sir_Walrus> Felix ez
[0:53:48] <%starotter70> Felix
[0:53:48] <%deviljhojho94> For a long time I tought Edelgard was named Edgelard and was like "LMAO who came up with that"
[0:53:49] <%Wynzler> Edgelard by a mile
[0:53:50] <xtremegamer80> @BestTeaMaker I THINK THAT ENEMY GOT THE POlNT
[0:53:51] <DopeyDragon> Archers don't do massive damage, they're for chip
[0:53:56] <Dracozombie5792> Right trigger is enemy threat range
[0:54:03] <$Tuskor13> @xtremegamer80 have you seen the character Alois in this game? he radiates Big Archibald Energy
[0:54:03] <%Divryne> Dedue dies next turn.
[0:54:05] <%gespenst25> El isn't an edgelord...
[0:54:06] <+zetastriker> Is he not aware that Ashe could've attacked via combat arte?
[0:54:09] <%joylent_blue> ppl compare him to Vergil and Sasuke but honestly his supports with Annette and other girls shows he's actually a big softie
[0:54:09] <%supersugoisenpai1> "Friends
[0:54:10] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean Felix has the edgelord attitude but Edelgard's out there doing the edgelord stuff
[0:54:11] <Onmi_Khaos> Archers don't do massive damage YET
[0:54:15] <%Quigsies> Tell that to Bernie
[0:54:17] <pectusumbra> they can do massive damage later
[0:54:18] <Roz_Lynd> clearly someone's never heard of shinon
[0:54:19] <%GabeSweetMan> Archers get crits fairly often.
[0:54:20] <%Kataguro> Shamir is for death
[0:54:22] <%deviljhojho94> Feel the burn
[0:54:22] <CastellanVon> Sylvain struggling to do 11 damage, meanwhile Felix does 15x2.
[0:54:23] <%Nobrev> some damage is better than no samage
[0:54:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Shamir would like a word
[0:54:25] <%rubbishbinge> Snipers will kill everything
[0:54:25] <betrayed_llama> @dracozombie5792 Archers do massive damage against flying enemies
[0:54:25] <%GabeSweetMan> Bernie will fuck you UP
[0:54:25] <xtremegamer80> @Tuskor13 YE
[0:54:26] <%Josef_Stryker> Shamir says otherwise
[0:54:26] <pectusumbra> Assassin's with bows are great
[0:54:27] <%Divryne> Bow Knight Bernie fucking DELETES people off the map.
[0:54:28] <Doodle_Taco> Edelgard is ab edgelord but in another wavelength
[0:54:28] <%BestTeaMaker> archers can do massive damage, but early on I used them for pickoffs
[0:54:28] <%tyler274> feel the bern
[0:54:28] <%gespenst25> Bernie and Leonie are for massive damage at least.
[0:54:30] <Galaxyman64> archers do big damage later
[0:54:30] <General_Terro> archers are only good late game
[0:54:31] <KingRipoff1> you can make em do massive damage
[0:54:34] <%miguelrod777> dodo
[0:54:34] <worldbrand> with all the grinding available to you, pat's not gonna encounter difficulty like ever in this playthrough
[0:54:34] <%VioletHeart> Bernie's actually for extremely small damage because her stat growths are awful.
[0:54:36] <%Kataguro> Bad roll
[0:54:36] <%BestTeaMaker> thanks doodoo
[0:54:37] <Sir_Walrus> Bernadetta sucks lol
[0:54:39] <+zetastriker> Archers with Killer bows are the way to go
[0:54:39] <DopeyDragon> Archers are shit in almost every FE except this one and Shadows of Valentia
[0:54:39] <%aivalera> Ashe did big damage for me
[0:54:42] <%starotter70> Petra was pretty good too in my playthrough
[0:54:42] <Vigonept> liar, archer kill everything
[0:54:44] <%GabeSweetMan> The close range counter skill makes archer OP as fuck
[0:54:45] <%Tearonex> Bernie is best archer
[0:54:45] <%Wynzler> Doodoo just out here serving his royal hine-ass
[0:54:47] <malesin_01> claude murders everything
[0:54:48] <KingRipoff1> shout out to crit build ignatz
[0:54:50] <bruno_silv0> archers are beasts the fuck you talking about
[0:54:53] <Zebroneath> Stop being so hawt, Felix

[0:55:03] <%GabeSweetMan> Quick train felix to be an archer.
[0:55:03] <%Divryne> HEY.

[0:55:08] <Sir_Walrus> Shoutout to Bernadetta’s 35% strength growth lol
[0:55:16] <%BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat you can equip mercedes with fire in the item menu when moving her
[0:55:17] <+Nomicro4u> HeyGuys
[0:55:18] <+runsoverfrogs> Hate how’s
[0:55:20] <%Copperama> When I first heard of FE X SMT, this is what I was thinking, not... idol quest
[0:55:23] <%miguelrod777> Another one
[0:55:24] <%gespenst25> oil those rusty swords holy shit
[0:55:25] <%joylent_blue> Helix

[0:55:49] <%GabeSweetMan> Healix the Felix
[0:55:50] <%gespenst25> @Copperama But this is just Fire Emblem?
[0:55:54] <%Kataguro> I had to do it to him
[0:55:54] <xtremegamer80> I had to do it to 'em
[0:55:54] <%valriot> LUL
[0:55:56] <Daxalog> The dead cant hate
[0:55:57] <%ShaneWhite> (
[0:55:57] <%gespenst25> He's alredy dead.
[0:55:59] <3xgilly> LUL
[0:56:00] <Doodle_Taco> He is dead
[0:56:01] <%StripesUltimateEdition> hey!
[0:56:04] <%GabeSweetMan> "I'm so good at Murder!"
[0:56:05] <CastellanVon> All the base archers have 35% strength growth.
[0:56:06] <xnashamin> big f
[0:56:07] <xtremegamer80> @Kataguro BEAT YA
[0:56:12] <betrayed_llama> Sylvain is the only one that feels sorry for murder LUL
[0:56:13] <Daxalog> This is just like Yggdra Union
[0:56:16] <+Grayhammatter> had to give it to him
[0:56:16] <+teg88> Sylvain is one of the best written guys i think
[0:56:22] <%gespenst25> He had it coming. He had it coming. He only had himself to blame.
[0:56:36] <%StaceMcGate> More exp if they are adjacent to Byleth
[0:56:40] <Sir_Walrus> @castellanvon yeah and the base archers are bad lol
[0:56:41] <pectusumbra> @Daxalog this game is nowhere near as fucked as Yggdra Union
[0:56:41] <garrulousAuthority> If you'd had been there, if you'd had seen it, I bet that you would've done the same!
[0:56:41] <+zetastriker> As someone at the end of a Blue Lions playthrough, it's weird seeing Annette do less than 50 damage double-attacks. XD
[0:56:41] <%GabeSweetMan> Sylvain is amazing at everything.
[0:56:49] <%joylent_blue> Linhardt is i think the only character that has legitimately traumatized 1st kill dialogue
[0:56:51] <%Quigsies> Move your front units first so that your back units can take their places
[0:57:00] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh hey something that's not rusted
[0:57:01] <%starotter70> @gespenst25 Damn it I can't remember the lyrics
[0:57:04] <%StaceMcGate> Sylvain had mediocre stat growth for my playthrough so I dropped him
[0:57:06] <%joylent_blue> "The blood.... what have i done?"
[0:57:06] <%gespenst25> Black Eagles: kills guys and throws up in horror. Blue Lions: I think he got the point!
[0:57:16] <Mr_Strut> Maybe she's waiting for a competent professor.
[0:57:23] <Roz_Lynd> pattyHelping pattyHelping pattyHelping pattyHelping I'M HELPING --chat (today, now)
[0:57:27] <%MisterTylerrr> PAT WHY ARE YOU SO MAD JUST WORK FOR FREE
[0:57:27] <bruno_silv0> lysithea is probably the best unit in the game, her damage is stupid
[0:57:31] <%GabeSweetMan> @Quigsies Hey don't backseat with your common sense logical strategery!
[0:57:33] <+zetastriker> Ingrid seems the best to me. She has all the advantages of the other good Blue Lions plus she no-sells magic attacks.
[0:57:36] <Sir_Walrus> Lysithea dope
[0:57:38] <%Kataguro> Dedue and Annette have that Mako X Gamagori energy. It's nice
[0:57:43] <%gespenst25> @starotter70 If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it, I'm guessing you would have done the same.
[0:57:44] <xtremegamer80> @gespenst25 Black Eagles: Going to get therapy after this. Blue Lions: Fortnite dancing on the corpses
[0:57:45] <+jkobe34> You know you can hit ZR to see the enemy's range of movement right?
[0:57:52] <%starotter70> @gespenst25 Thanks LUL
[0:57:56] <%StaceMcGate> Ingrid only suffers on strength but is amazing at everything else
[0:57:57] <%GarbageNirvana> Ingrid does seem like a good mage hunter
[0:57:57] <pectusumbra> I can't wait for Lysithea to make it into the gacha game
[0:57:59] <%Quigsies> @GabeSweetMan Ah dangit LUL
[0:57:59] <%Kataguro> A mistake for him
[0:58:03] <%GarbageNirvana> Especially if you have her flying
[0:58:07] <%Wynzler> How is Doodoo so goddamn beefy
[0:58:10] <AMDBR9S> Ingrid is so broken
[0:58:10] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[0:58:11] <%Kataguro> Hey Yosuke
[0:58:12] <+Grayhammatter> that's also a mistake
[0:58:12] <%deviljhojho94> nice voice lmao
[0:58:13] <Daxalog> You sound 14 sir
[0:58:16] <%GabeSweetMan> Totally fitting voice
[0:58:18] <%Laecerelius> NYEEEEH!
[0:58:19] <%VioletHeart> Ingrid's resistance is sky high too so she's great at circling around the group and hitting mages.
[0:58:19] <betrayed_llama> D:
[0:58:30] <PkSilent01> !bluelions
[0:58:35] <+Risingxiv> Yuri Lowenthal appears again
[0:58:38] <hntronium> Didn't expect to get that voice out of that art
[0:58:38] <%miguelrod777> YEEEA
[0:58:38] <Valdorick> Finder's keepers is about the worst defense to use against people showing with sword to impale you for theft.
[0:58:42] <%VioletHeart> @AngriestPat Top tip. If you make mages equip healing spells it makes their dodge stat go through the roof. Usually better for support mages than having their bow equipped.
[0:58:44] <%GabeSweetMan> Ingrid can smack mages around like a bully on a playground.
[0:58:49] <%StaceMcGate> Mercedes is the best healer in the game. Annette is good too but her spells are generic, she doesn't even learn Meteor
[0:58:53] <Sir_Walrus> Leonie is actually superb if you make her a flier
[0:59:09] <%Quigsies> I feel like byleth is a walking tank in this game
[0:59:12] <%joylent_blue> bow knight Leonie is a god
[0:59:17] <%supersugoisenpai1> VIP Annette
[0:59:18] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[0:59:19] <%GabeSweetMan> BOOOO
[0:59:20] <bruno_silv0> flying units are broken in general
[0:59:26] <+zetastriker> I waited one month too long to recruit Leonie and couldn't get her on my playthrough. ;__;
[0:59:31] <Sir_Walrus> Bow knight Leonie LUL
[0:59:31] <%Kataguro> Ingrid is very slow to start
[0:59:32] <Daxalog> Atleast she has an increased chance to dodge
[0:59:32] <%Copperama> time to reset
[0:59:33] <%gespenst25> Smugly: i had no choice.
[0:59:34] <ShichiNoBushi> "Professor is controlling my brain."
[0:59:34] <xtremegamer80> THAT'S A LOTTA DAMAGE
[0:59:37] <Doodle_Taco> I made Leonie a Pegasus Knight and she was literally unkillable
[0:59:38] <%Wynzler> I can't stand Leonie enough to use her tho
[0:59:39] <+runningfleet> is this on hard?
[0:59:42] <DownPlayTwitch> My own mind goblins have been making me keep all my characters at the same level, even though I am on my second playthrough I have everyone recruited so I have like 20+ fucking nerds
[0:59:43] <Onmi_Khaos> No
[0:59:43] <%aivalera> @AngriestPat If you want to level people up faster, have them attack next to Byleth. His special ability gives adjecent allies extra EXP
[0:59:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> When I look at Annette I can't help but start humming COLOURS WEAVE INTO A SPIRAL OF FLAME
[0:59:47] <%Wynzler> Literally every line of dialogue is about JERALT
[0:59:48] <%joylent_blue> runningfleet no
[0:59:50] <%snow_bush> I see Pat has made the superior faction choice
[0:59:51] <DopeyDragon> You could just wait and let him attack so you can kill him on player phase
[0:59:51] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[0:59:54] <%starotter70> 6%
[0:59:55] <%supersugoisenpai1> 94
[0:59:55] <+runningfleet> so normal?
[0:59:58] <%Copperama> let him die
[1:00:00] <+Grayhammatter> that's XCOM levels of bad
[1:00:01] <%joylent_blue> thanks Felix
[1:00:01] <%Kataguro> Vergil pls
[1:00:02] <%gespenst25> more ly syl-lame
[1:00:04] <%goose_attack_almanac> XCOM Gun in mouth scenario
[1:00:09] <%Kataguro> POWER
[1:00:09] <Doodle_Taco> @wynzler I did toi but eventually used her
[1:00:09] <%Copperama> oh wait, is this classic or dirty casual
[1:00:10] <%StaceMcGate> Use dem combat arts
[1:00:14] <+Grayhammatter> more POWER
[1:00:14] <Onmi_Khaos> Felix: "We're not friends B-baka!"
[1:00:18] <%miguelrod777> POWER
[1:00:19] <%joylent_blue> fuck that chest key you have ASHE
[1:00:20] <Roz_Lynd> dirty casual
[1:00:22] <MeepoDhui> Felix is an alpha
[1:00:22] <%UW_Duncan> "Another head chopped off!"
[1:00:37] <%Copperama> gu-ross, dirty casual? egh, bleh
[1:00:39] <%GabeSweetMan> I THINK that enemy got.... THE POINT
[1:00:46] <Sir_Walrus> @copperama normal casual, the babbiest difficulty possible
[1:00:52] <+zetastriker> YOU EQUPPED IT
[1:00:53] <%miguelrod777> crazy talk
[1:00:53] <nevertrustcheez> carnageHuh carnageHuh
[1:00:54] <Daxalog> Atleast he got some good hits in tho
[1:00:55] <%Kataguro> You used a Javelin last
[1:00:58] <%legendfather_of_giants> WELL YEAH
[1:00:58] <%supersugoisenpai1> She had the javelin equiped
[1:00:59] <%StaceMcGate> Warmaster and Warrior have the best class mastery abilities, they effectively quadruple your crit rate
[1:00:59] <Onmi_Khaos> You HAD HER EQUIPPED WITH IT
[1:00:59] <+Grayhammatter> you equipped her with a javelin
[1:01:00] <%Quigsies> It's what she was equipped with!
[1:01:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> That's on you, Rick.
[1:01:00] <pectusumbra> because you had her attack with the jav man
[1:01:01] <%wsintai> thats how it work
[1:01:09] <%Copperama> n-normal casual? I THOUGHT PAT WAS MASTER GAMER
[1:01:09] <%wsintai> apatCrazy
[1:01:09] <%miguelrod777> they dont change weapons after thier turns
[1:01:16] <hntronium> no pat, its what you are doing
[1:01:18] <%Onlysamfisher > Onlysamfisher  subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[1:01:21] <%MisterTylerrr> Boy I wish I could like this style of game
[1:01:24] <%galaxyswirl> wait he playing on normal casual?
[1:01:25] <Roz_Lynd> i miss the old crit animations where they were extravagant and animu about it
[1:01:26] <%GabeSweetMan> Nice
[1:01:29] <Onmi_Khaos> If you want to do that, you trade with the person who attacked with the ranged weapon after
[1:01:30] <%Kataguro> That one was fine
[1:01:30] <%Wynzler> Ingrid is p great but her STR stat struggled for me through the whole game
[1:01:33] <3xgilly> Pat the male voice actor for Bailiff changed
[1:01:33] <%GabeSweetMan> No that was a good level
[1:01:33] <+Grayhammatter> that's a nice growth
[1:01:35] <prime_name> It happens.
[1:01:36] <%joylent_blue> nah her res went up thats good
[1:01:36] <%VioletHeart> Nah these are pretty normal for early game.
[1:01:37] <Sir_Walrus> More than anything Pat is a babby coward
[1:01:43] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> I had a bad growth once, I needed to see a doctor about it.
[1:01:44] <%Kataguro> Pat, lockpick with Ashe
[1:01:47] <%aivalera> Growths don't matter in this one as much as the others
[1:01:47] <+silveranthony91> I love the part of Ingrid having a 5 hour rant to Dimitri about Dusar crime statistics
[1:01:52] <Doodle_Taco> Level 1 thug
[1:01:55] <%StaceMcGate> I think Dimitri is the most powerful lord, I've done 700 damage with him
[1:01:57] <pectusumbra> also spam that rally on annette for free support points
[1:02:00] <%GabeSweetMan> Honestly in the late game, DEF and RES are waaaay more important.
[1:02:09] <garrulousAuthority> @AngriestPat if Annette isn't doing anything have her Rally someone no matter what
[1:02:10] <%GabeSweetMan> The odds of getting fuckin wrekt increases so much.
[1:02:11] <Roz_Lynd> pattyHi
[1:02:16] <Sir_Walrus> Dimitri is literally the best unit in the game lol

[1:03:10] <%StaceMcGate> @Onlysamfisher I screwed up the 2nd successor and didn't get all the vestiges before the fight. I didn't know you only had one shot
[1:03:12] <%GabeSweetMan> Critical hit animations aren't nearly as cool.
[1:03:25] <%GabeSweetMan> The GBA sprites still remain the coolest animations in the series.
[1:03:37] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Are you going to recruit Lysithea first?
[1:03:37] <xtremegamer80> Okay gang, who in the Blue Lions has Dark Spikes?
[1:03:43] <%Meidolaon> Nah, the GBA crits were silly
[1:03:44] <%UW_Duncan> GBA crits were the best
[1:03:44] <%RubberFistFight> @Roz_Lynd THAT ONE TOO
[1:03:50] <Sir_Walrus> No FE game will have animations as cool as the GBA games
[1:03:51] <%Meidolaon> Echoes has the best Crit animations
[1:03:52] <%Onlysamfisher > WAIT @stacemcgate that actually matters????
[1:03:53] <+Destructive_Forces> This game has combat? PogChamp
[1:03:53] <Roz_Lynd> pattyNice pattyGuns
[1:03:53] <%StaceMcGate> @xtremegamer80 no one, only Hubert and Lysithea
[1:03:56] <Quietshun13> gba sprites were amazing
[1:03:56] <%starotter70> She Stronk
[1:03:57] <%GabeSweetMan> @Meidolaon They can be both at once tho.
[1:04:00] <%GarbageNirvana> Man, you wanna talk about busted
[1:04:01] <%rubbishbinge> GBA Heros are the absolute coolest
[1:04:01] <%Wynzler> As bad as Sacred Stones was, Ephraim had the coolest crit animation
[1:04:04] <%supersugoisenpai1> Death Knight fears Lysithea
[1:04:06] <%Kataguro> Dex is fine
[1:04:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Tiny hat girl tho
[1:04:08] <+NobuuNobuu> Recruit the tiny mage
[1:04:09] <%Dr00_PhD> Res is good tho
[1:04:10] <+Nomicro4u> SSTaaauuuutts
[1:04:10] <%RubberFistFight> @Roz_Lynd you know a dude named KumaTorey by any chance?
[1:04:12] <betrayed_llama> Lysithea is EZ mode
[1:04:12] <%GabeSweetMan> STAAuuuts
[1:04:13] <%Divryne> It's fiiinnne Pat.
[1:04:14] <Valdorick> Anti-Streamer Luck
[1:04:15] <%joylent_blue> thats why you always recruit Lysithea
[1:04:16] <+Grayhammatter> it's not all about the strength pat
[1:04:16] <%VioletHeart> This is early-game stat growth, Pat.
[1:04:18] <%aivalera> Try to recruit Lorenz first if you can. Trust me on that
[1:04:19] <%tyler274> you got shit classes pat
[1:04:19] <%bread_assassin> @AngriestPat You might want to look into recruiting Caspar, too.
[1:04:20] <Roz_Lynd> iiiiiiiiiii dunno
[1:04:21] <Doodle_Taco> Lysithea is very strink
[1:04:22] <AMDBR9S> crit
[1:04:22] <%Divryne> Crit chance.
[1:04:23] <%GabeSweetMan> BUT STRENGTH NOT GO UP
[1:04:23] <+Grayhammatter> Crit chance
[1:04:24] <DopeyDragon> Crits
[1:04:24] <Nekros4442> crit
[1:04:25] <%Divryne> And hit rate.
[1:04:25] <%sourceofall> crit chance
[1:04:25] <%Wynzler> It's this game's skill stat
[1:04:26] <%Quigsies> Crit
[1:04:26] <%starotter70> Crit
[1:04:27] <%VioletHeart> Dex is accuracy and crit chance.
[1:04:28] <%supersugoisenpai1> better hit and crit rate
[1:04:28] <+lordsdb> redo
[1:04:29] <Sir_Walrus> @wynzler “as bad as sacred stones was” thems fightin words
[1:04:29] <$Tuskor13> Dex is crits and accuracy
[1:04:29] <Doodle_Taco> Crits
[1:04:30] <%Meidolaon> Dex does a lot LUL
[1:04:30] <%VioletHeart> I'm pretty sure.
[1:04:30] <%StaceMcGate> @Onlysamfisher Yeah, if you don't repair their vestiges before the successor fights you DON'T get their cores and good ending
[1:04:31] <%gespenst25> other strength Kappa
[1:04:31] <%tyler274> dex is chance to crit
[1:04:31] <MeepoDhui> Dex = higher hit chance and crit
[1:04:31] <prime_name> Crit and Hit rate
[1:04:33] <General_Terro> imagine getting 5 level ups with only 1 stat each time
[1:04:33] <%Kataguro> Motherfucker
[1:04:34] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[1:04:35] <tri3dgE027> thorwSmug Bad RNG thorwSmug
[1:04:36] <%AncelDeLambert> you can read what the stats do in the character sheet
[1:04:41] <Daxalog> One of them called him a nerd
[1:04:45] <%aivalera> Dex increases Crit rate and accuracy, as well as certain skills" activation rate
[1:04:45] <%RubberFistFight> @Roz_Lynd well, he uses the spongebob ones all the damn time, so LUL
[1:04:46] <ooblag> Dec is % to hit, and % to crit
[1:04:46] <%GabeSweetMan> BUT PAT WANT STR GO UP
[1:04:50] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat go into the menu and hit X to read what stats do
[1:04:52] <%goose_attack_almanac> You can fast forward those animations, should you want.
[1:04:55] <Roz_Lynd> nice
[1:04:55] <%rubbishbinge> Dex is Skl
[1:04:56] <ooblag> Dex*
[1:05:01] <Sir_Walrus> @angriestpat dex’s important effect is hit rate
[1:05:01] <%gespenst25> He's not a thief he just has lock touch for some reason
[1:05:05] <DawnsRoyal> is this pats first playthrough?
[1:05:07] <%GabeSweetMan> If the STR doesn't go UP it might as well be going DOWN.
[1:05:08] <%Kataguro> But why
[1:05:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> heart go up
[1:05:14] <garrulousAuthority> He has locktouch because he grew up a thief on the streets
[1:05:16] <%DevinMayCry> Hes poor so he knows how to steal is all
[1:05:21] <DopeyDragon> If you line them up, you are just going to get gambited again.
[1:05:23] <%supersugoisenpai1> That dude hates Sylvain
[1:05:31] <%StaceMcGate> Lysithea should always be your first recruit, she is the games best boss killer
[1:05:37] <%GabeSweetMan> Sylvain probably fucked his sister or something.
[1:05:38] <%Kataguro> Hahahaha
[1:05:40] <+Elky3> Slyvain does better with an Axe @AngriestPat
[1:05:41] <+manzon2k> Why does he keep going for the chad Sylvain
[1:05:41] <%Onlysamfisher > @stacemcgate fuck........ I was wondering why I could only restore Aurora and Ava's forms but not the others..... dammit
[1:05:44] <%GarbageNirvana> uh
[1:05:46] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Aw yeaaaaaah
[1:05:46] <%Josef_Stryker> Sylvain is a beast later on.
[1:05:47] <ooblag> Yes, the blood dick
[1:05:48] <%gespenst25> ...no
[1:05:49] <%Berb64> Thievery learned from Woolie
[1:05:49] <%starotter70> Sylvain needs moisture
[1:05:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> His dick gets moist on its own
[1:05:54] <$Tuskor13> Sylvain canonically has yet to fuck in the lore
[1:05:55] <%Kataguro> Sylvain is a very good Wyvern Lord
[1:06:00] <+manzon2k> Sylvain is one of the best mounted units in the game
[1:06:01] <%joylent_blue> GabeSweetMan nah he was abused by his brother tho
[1:06:02] <%bread_assassin> On my BE playthrough, Syvain was my best unit, You're getting screwed by RNG.
[1:06:04] <%StaceMcGate> @Onlysamfisher Yeah, gonna have to wait until NG+ LUL
[1:06:10] <Saltima> I come in and immediately hear "Just give up"... sugoiLain
[1:06:14] <%DevinMayCry> Sylvain will catch up
[1:06:16] <Roz_Lynd> most of them have yet to fuck because they're all 14 years old
[1:06:17] <Garann> hes only level 2
[1:06:21] <%Onlysamfisher > I'm doing another playthrough soon lol
[1:06:24] <Sir_Walrus> Sylvain is pretty good he just has mediocre dex which hurts him
[1:06:29] <$Tarcanist_> I don't get the hype for this game
[1:06:31] <Teaka> Bylad
[1:06:32] <%Kataguro> Pat, try to position people next to each other for the affinity bonus
[1:06:37] <%StaceMcGate> Always stack your units adjacent to each other for support
[1:06:39] <+manzon2k> Most of the students are teenagers except for Mercedes, who is like 22 at the start of the game
[1:06:39] <Sir_Walrus> His strength speed and def are dope
[1:06:40] <%GabeSweetMan> @joylent_blue No no someone ELSE' sister.
[1:06:50] <CastellanVon> *Get one bad level up* This character is garbage, I got so screwed by RNG.
[1:06:54] <%Kataguro> THE WALL
[1:06:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Mercedes is 23
[1:06:55] <%joylent_blue> GabeSweetMan OH yeah definitely
[1:06:56] <%GabeSweetMan> Specifically the dude attacking him.
[1:07:05] <DopeyDragon> Keep units adjacent EXCEPT if an enemy has a battalion
[1:07:05] <%Wynzler> Beefy boi got beefier
[1:07:06] <Roz_Lynd> @AngriestPat pat honey u do whatchu want and i'll enjoy the show!
[1:07:11] <%GabeSweetMan> "You broke her heart you jerk!"
[1:07:11] <Teaka> Don't slap, da dedue
[1:07:14] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> not my dedue!
[1:07:15] <%StaceMcGate> but since Pat is playing on baby mode we got nothing to worry about
[1:07:21] <$Tuskor13> Ingrid getting doubled LUL
[1:07:22] <%Kataguro> Don't drop that Picklepee
[1:07:22] <%tyler274> you pump ingrid
[1:07:23] <Teaka> dedon't do that
[1:07:26] <Doodle_Taco> My dodoo cant posibly be this strong
[1:07:34] <%GabeSweetMan> Don't hit my Darude Sandstorm.
[1:07:35] <KoshiLowell> Pat's played Black Eagles right?
[1:07:39] <%Quigsies> DeDone for
[1:07:45] <%joylent_blue> give Sylvain EXP BibleThump
[1:07:48] <%VioletHeart> Not really @KoshiLowell
[1:07:50] <%Copperama> magic is so fun and good in this game, it might be... too good
[1:07:50] <%DevinMayCry> @Tarcanist_ I dunno what you mean by that. You mean why people like it? Its both one of the best FE ina while AND it escaped the awakening mold the series got stuck in while adding a lot of new mechanics that are actually well received.
[1:07:54] <Sir_Walrus> Like 1/3 through Eagles lol
[1:07:55] <%aivalera> @AngriestPat They changed how the affinity growth works in 3h, you now also get a bonus if an ally can target an enemy as well. That's where the good stuff is for the archers
[1:07:57] <prime_name> Dimitri can always be more overpowered
[1:08:08] <%Meidolaon> Still a better LP than Woolie's LUL
[1:08:12] <ooblag> Do you mean you played until August, or chapter 8?
[1:08:14] <KoshiLowell> Oh then asking which House is your favorite wouldn't be a viable question huh
[1:08:22] <%Kataguro> Bush him
[1:08:27] <Teaka> Where my Deer gang at
[1:08:33] <Roz_Lynd> pattyGoof
[1:08:33] <garrulousAuthority> #FearTheDeer
[1:08:33] <%joylent_blue> go sit in the corner Dimitri
[1:08:35] <%gespenst25> @Meidolaon What are you talking about? This game clearly stars Tiki and Clod.
[1:08:38] <%tyler274> give them something to believe in
[1:08:40] <%StaceMcGate> Final mission for Blue Lions on maddening was hell, you get sniped from everywhere
[1:08:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @ooblag he did up until the month you can accidentally skip
[1:08:43] <RazHarvey> is this better than the gamecube one?
[1:08:44] <Doodle_Taco> @teaka Aye!!!!!
[1:08:45] <%Quigsies> Black Eagle Strikeforce rise up
[1:08:46] <%Wynzler> I have a love hate relationship with the Deer
[1:08:50] <Sir_Walrus> @teaka Deer Gaaaaaang
[1:08:51] <xtremegamer80> How long until Pat starts bringing his units to grind for materials?
[1:08:52] <%Dr00_PhD> Fear the Deer baby
[1:08:53] <%Wynzler> Because Claude is obviously best lord
[1:08:58] <%Meidolaon> Man, it's impressive how bad Woolie botched it
[1:08:59] <Teaka> @Sir_Walrus @Doodle_Taco hell yeah
[1:09:01] <$Tuskor13> He told you not to Dedue it
[1:09:05] <%Wynzler> But half the units just suck in that house
[1:09:07] <%StaceMcGate> Golden Deer has the best girls but worst boys
[1:09:07] <+manzon2k> Am I the only one who like the Lions
[1:09:07] <%starotter70> I warned you bro
[1:09:08] <Roz_Lynd> lyndis is the only lord for me
[1:09:10] <KoshiLowell> "Yeah my wife died."
[1:09:12] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Everytime you say the teacher's name, it makes me think of the Berserk behelit.
[1:09:13] <ShichiNoBushi> You told him. It was on record.
[1:09:13] <%DevinMayCry> @Meidolaon I didnt watch it what he do?
[1:09:14] <+runningfleet> the lions are cool
[1:09:15] <KoshiLowell> Oh. Replacement baby?
[1:09:19] <xtremegamer80> @Teaka *Deer screech*
[1:09:19] <%GabeSweetMan> At least we aren't playing Sacred Stones with The Grind Tower. All of the Goblins come out in full force in that game.
[1:09:23] <DopeyDragon> Edlegard did literally everything wrong
[1:09:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @manzon2k nah, they have their charms
[1:09:30] <+runningfleet> dimitri has the best arc of the 3
[1:09:33] <%joylent_blue> manzon2k nah BL has turned out ranked 1st in several popularity polls
[1:09:36] <%Quigsies> Ran out of uses
[1:09:40] <Sir_Walrus> No spoilers chat
[1:09:41] <%aivalera> AND THATS WHY YOU GIVE ANNETTE AN AX
[1:09:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> No smoilers
[1:09:45] <Teaka> @xtremegamer80 limesOK
[1:09:48] <Doodle_Taco> @stacemcgate Lorenz is actually alright tho
[1:09:53] <%Kataguro> Or just give her more magics
[1:09:54] <KoshiLowell> It really surprised me to see that Blue Lions being the "Classic" rotue
[1:09:57] <%joylent_blue> granted, many of those polls had majority female voting demographic
[1:10:06] <garrulousAuthority> who dares mock our lord Lorenz Hellman Gloucester
[1:10:08] <%RubberFistFight> You got a great big convoy, rockin through the night
[1:10:08] <oghalloween> oh we got a great big convoy
[1:10:09] <Sir_Walrus> Lorenz is bad, Ignatz is bad
[1:10:09] <senfood> convooooooy
[1:10:09] <KoshiLowell> but Blue Lions is my favorite
[1:10:10] <%Imperial_Madman> Imperial_Madman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 20 month streak! Happy 20th month!!!!!!!! give Elmo a big belly rub and let him know i love him very much
[1:10:13] <Teaka> @StaceMcGate Claude stole all the best boy power for himself
[1:10:14] <%GabeSweetMan> yeyeye
[1:10:21] <oghalloween> THEY EVEN HAD A BEAR IN THE AIR
[1:10:24] <bruno_silv0> golden deer have some of the best characters in the game but then also has ignatz and the fucking purple dude which i refuse to know the name of
[1:10:28] <%Kataguro> Look at that girly run
[1:10:30] <xtremegamer80> @Teaka Raphael ate all of it
[1:10:31] <%RubberFistFight> @oghalloween ain't she a beautiful sight? C O N V O O O Y
[1:10:33] <%gespenst25> bop
[1:10:36] <Sir_Walrus> Raph is bad until he gets Quick Riposte which makes him dope
[1:10:38] <%StaceMcGate> Lorenz is alright in some supports, but he is mediocre as a unit. Ignatz and Raphael are just so forgettable.
[1:10:44] <DopeyDragon> @bruno_silv0 Lorenz is based, fuck you bud
[1:10:44] <Teaka> @xtremegamer80 can we blame him he's a growing boy
[1:10:52] <%joylent_blue> smh Lorenz is a great character that ppl never get to know because of his haircut
[1:10:52] <%sl8r4l8r> 10-4 , good buddy
[1:10:52] <%Wynzler> Don't insult Raph like that
[1:10:53] <xtremegamer80> @Teaka A growing unit
[1:10:54] <%gespenst25> Lorenz is a cunt.
[1:10:57] <%tyler274> lorenz gets less shitty but early is wood
[1:10:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @bruno_silv0 I just call him Numba 1. It's probably not the same VA but it does sound like him
[1:10:59] <%tyler274> *woof
[1:11:02] <%aivalera> @StaceMcGate His true benefit comes from his special weapon
[1:11:03] <%GabeSweetMan> He's a priest, give him some slack.
[1:11:05] <Sir_Walrus> But then you have Leonie Hilda and Lysithea who are all great
[1:11:05] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat HE LEARNED IT BY WATCHING YOU Kappa
[1:11:10] <Teaka> Lorenz gets the award for most improved
[1:11:13] <oghalloween> CUZ WE GOT A GREAT BIG CONVOY
[1:11:14] <%StaceMcGate> @aivalera which you give to Lysithea to make her a GOD
[1:11:15] <garrulousAuthority> @aivalera it actually is the same VA
[1:11:17] <garrulousAuthority> Ben Diskin
[1:11:18] <%starotter70> ...
[1:11:21] <%gespenst25> You've got me to dedue
[1:11:21] <Halospaz117> I Dedon't get it
[1:11:24] <ChineseNininga> hehehehe
[1:11:24] <%joylent_blue> pvpBOO
[1:11:25] <%tyler274> yea you need lorenz for the relic his paralogue gives you
[1:11:26] <KoshiLowell> ...
[1:11:28] <RazHarvey> hehe
[1:11:28] <$Tuskor13> You can't Dedue that joke with every sentence
[1:11:30] <+NoGoodAtGames> >not standing next to Byleth for bonus exp
[1:11:32] <%Kataguro> She's dodging great
[1:11:36] <%Wynzler> Ignatz should be taken out back like Old Yeller
[1:11:37] <Doodle_Taco> Lorenz is really encouraging to Ignatz and Marianne tho
[1:11:38] <+Risingxiv> sbfpSandbag sbfpSandbag sbfpSandbag sbfpSandbag
[1:11:41] <Teaka> @tyler274 that relic is fucking busted
[1:11:45] <KoshiLowell> Who is Pat's favorite so far
[1:11:47] <%GabeSweetMan> Darude Sandstorm is my favorite Blue Lion in the monastery.
[1:11:48] <%aivalera> @StaceMcGate You're damn right about that !! LUL
[1:11:48] <Sir_Walrus> Oh and Marianne is great
[1:11:51] <%joylent_blue> KoshiLowell Felix
[1:11:56] <KoshiLowell> unsurprising
[1:11:56] <%Wynzler> If anyone is encouraging to Ignatz they should be shot too
[1:11:58] <%tyler274> Lorenz exists to make Lysithea better via his relic
[1:11:59] <KoshiLowell> is it because he's OP
[1:12:03] <%joylent_blue> Felix is everyone's favorite
[1:12:04] <+NoGoodAtGames> @AngriestPat missing out on free exp
[1:12:05] <%gespenst25> I bear this priest to death with a wooden axe.
[1:12:06] <Sir_Walrus> And yeah Thyrsus is more useful than Lorenz LUL
[1:12:08] <oghalloween> I will beat a joke like a body until the flesh that is funny strips from the bone
[1:12:10] <+conradical> i had several level ups where i got 0 stat increases. feelsbadman
[1:12:14] <%StaceMcGate> Flayn is the best unit to make a dancer
[1:12:20] <Teaka> Stoop kid!
[1:12:22] <Doodle_Taco> @wynzler But Marianne tho
[1:12:25] <%MisterTylerrr> How does awakening stack up to this one? I can't seem to get behind the characters designs in this one
[1:12:26] <Teaka> Stoop kid fraid to leave his stoop!
[1:12:27] <chronoxgp> wish this came out on the wii u instead

[1:12:32] <%Kataguro> She out
[1:12:37] <oghalloween> STOOP KID
[1:12:38] <KoshiLowell> I like to think of this game as
[1:12:38] <Quietshun13> any unit that ends up sucking should be your dancer
[1:12:39] <%Josef_Stryker> LIGHT HIM UP
[1:12:42] <Teaka> @AngriestPat you can grind stoop kid for xp
[1:12:42] <KoshiLowell> Fire Emblem Fates but Good

[1:12:55] <%tyler274> wait no
[1:12:56] <%gespenst25> @StaceMcGate I like to make a healer into the dancer so if I don't need them to heal they can dance. Flan counts.
[1:12:57] <%tyler274> take that back
[1:12:58] <+OkamiDude15> So who’s the brick shit house of the team?
[1:12:58] <tri3dgE027> @chronoxgp You're pretty much telling the Franchise to die if this came out in the WiiU.
[1:13:00] <%GabeSweetMan> YIKES
[1:13:00] <Sir_Walrus> @mistertylerrr awakening is much worse than this game lol
[1:13:02] <%Kataguro> ABUNAI
[1:13:04] <Passthechete> Bigmus Take

[1:13:19] <%aivalera> He heals every turn so you totally can
[1:13:23] <Daxalog> Stoop kid wont get off his stoop!
[1:13:26] <oghalloween> SHE TALKS CRAZY TALK
[1:13:30] <Teaka> @AngriestPat ranged attacks and he'll never leave his stoop
[1:13:32] <%GabeSweetMan> You can abuse Rally for free support ups.
[1:13:32] <%wsintai> LVL 100 ASHE ONLY RUN LETS GO @AngriestPat
[1:13:32] <%Quigsies> YUP
[1:13:34] <chronoxgp> a 3ds could run this game
[1:13:34] <%joylent_blue> i mean
[1:13:35] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat because he heals every turn you can pelt him with ranged attacks then let him heal up
[1:13:35] <%StaceMcGate> the fact you get unlimited battles in Normal angers me
[1:13:36] <%joylent_blue> sure
[1:13:36] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[1:13:37] <WaterDragon68> That's a truth
[1:13:37] <%cvp5127> yes
[1:13:38] <Onmi_Khaos> Don't fucking get him on boss abuse you god damn nerds!
[1:13:38] <%Kataguro> Probably accurate
[1:13:39] <$Tuskor13> Felix IS god
[1:13:40] <%lemuhollow> Is Pat on hard or Maddening?
[1:13:40] <%MisterTylerrr> Well then
[1:13:41] <+Tyonidus> atpSpiner atpSpiner atpSpiner
[1:13:44] <%starotter70> Yeah, cause it's so pointy
[1:13:44] <xtremegamer80> Felix doesn't want to fuck Lysithea
[1:13:45] <%aivalera> You'll be at it all night but you can level up infitely with him
[1:13:49] <+OkamiDude15> And so he did
[1:13:49] <Quietshun13> Pats on normal
[1:13:50] <bruno_silv0> as soon as i had more units i didnt interact with ignatz and purple dude at all, and not gonna lie i thought of letting them die on purpose but my gobolins didnt let me
[1:13:51] <RazHarvey> i'm guessing as long as you dont get one shotted you can grind
[1:13:52] <%StaceMcGate> Pat is on Normal/Casual
[1:13:54] <Sir_Walrus> @lemuhollow none of the above
[1:13:54] <%GabeSweetMan> Pat is on Normal. Like a BINCH.
[1:13:54] <%joylent_blue> lemuhollow those are funny options you decided to giv
[1:13:55] <%wsintai> @lemuhollow Pat's life is on Maddening by default
[1:14:00] <%Saltmeisterr> pat is getting real horny on stream
[1:14:03] <DopeyDragon> @lemuhollow pat is on bab mode
[1:14:09] <garrulousAuthority> @wsintai you're not wrong
[1:14:09] <%joylent_blue> DON'T MISS
[1:14:10] <%Kataguro> RISKY
[1:14:12] <%korth367> pls miss
[1:14:12] <%goose_attack_almanac> Felix probably has a Sin Devil Trigger.
[1:14:14] <WaterDragon68> You go first, so might as well
[1:14:14] <%GabeSweetMan> The Goblins however have selected maddening by default. apatGoblin
[1:14:14] <%DevinMayCry> Switch weapons maybe
[1:14:19] <%Josef_Stryker> WHY?
[1:14:22] <tri3dgE027> Lysithea is like 14-15, he has reasons why toucher her would be a bad-idea @xtremegamer80 LUL
[1:14:24] <oghalloween> MADENing?
[1:14:30] <%joylent_blue> more grinding pvpSass
[1:14:30] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Use combart arts for better chances to hit
[1:14:33] <RazHarvey> god this enemy is so dumb lol
[1:14:34] <Teaka> YEah
[1:14:34] <%Josef_Stryker> OK SURE
[1:14:34] <Passthechete> i suppose you could gain exp this way
[1:14:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I like how Ignatz' bonus is due to his glasses. It funny
[1:14:36] <%joylent_blue> WOW
[1:14:36] <%GabeSweetMan> NICEEEE
[1:14:38] <ooblag> NICE
[1:14:39] <Teaka> PogChamp
[1:14:39] <%DevinMayCry> Jesus Ashe

[1:14:41] <%MonsterEnvy> That was good level
[1:14:41] <pectusumbra> very nice
[1:14:41] <%cvp5127> yeyeyeye cheat
[1:14:42] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Yoooooooo~
[1:14:43] <Onmi_Khaos> @AngriestPat What they mean is, because he's on a healing tile, you could end turn and let him heal and regen his HP to level up endlessly. This is called 'Boss Abuse' and it's boring as fuck
[1:14:44] <%rubbishbinge> noice
[1:14:44] <Teaka> GOD level PogChamp
[1:14:45] <%Laecerelius> Almost perfect!
[1:14:48] <xtremegamer80> @tri3dgE027 Exactly
[1:14:49] <Passthechete> heal fight heal fight repeat
[1:14:53] <%wsintai> In which Ashe solos the game
[1:14:55] <Sir_Walrus> No speed, trash level
[1:14:58] <%Copperama> oh hey, it's that kid I murdered in my playthrough
[1:14:59] <%Kataguro> Javelin him from afar
[1:14:59] <oghalloween> I HAVE NO IDEA WHATS GOING ON POG POG POG
[1:15:01] <%joylent_blue> one of Ashe's level up lines is "Without power, who can you protect?" i shit you not
[1:15:01] <Graywolf_the_45th> miss
[1:15:02] <ooblag> Protip: The most EXP you can ever get is 100
[1:15:03] <DopeyDragon> Just don't miss 4Head
[1:15:03] <%tyler274> PUMP INGRID
[1:15:05] <%GabeSweetMan> Sometimes the roles are super not in some character's favor. I got *fuuuucked* with Ferdinand in my playthrough.
[1:15:06] <%gespenst25> Didn't even need Killer Queen, Bites the Dust!
[1:15:06] <%starotter70> You did it
[1:15:07] <Teaka> Remember that level when someone eventually gets a 0 level
[1:15:09] <%MonsterEnvy> Goodbye Kostas
[1:15:09] <Daxalog> ALL on HIS OWN
[1:15:10] <RazHarvey> he REALLy doesn't want to leave that spot
[1:15:12] <%cvp5127> not optimal
[1:15:12] <%zamzoph> F
[1:15:13] <$Tuskor13> @oghalloween he got a lot of stats so his Numbers went Up
[1:15:18] <%StaceMcGate> If you don't use Catherine or Shamir you are wrong
[1:15:18] <pectusumbra> yeah, it's boring and not needed given that you get infinite fights to grind with
[1:15:19] <%GabeSweetMan> NICE
[1:15:21] <%joylent_blue> thats good
[1:15:22] <%Kataguro> Good
[1:15:22] <oghalloween> BITEZADUSTO
[1:15:24] <%Copperama> BIG Mistake....
[1:15:24] <ooblag> Decent level
[1:15:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> stat gain being random is lame
[1:15:28] <SPidERMan8576> atpOld
[1:15:29] <%Kataguro> Dimitri says from the corner
[1:15:30] <%GabeSweetMan> STR DEF RES are most important.
[1:15:30] <%DevinMayCry> That was a good one
[1:15:35] <%Wynzler> Imagine using Boss Abuse when there are free, endless battles every week
[1:15:37] <%FirearmsInstructor> WTF IS THIS D:
[1:15:37] <%joylent_blue> Your highness why are you cowering in the corner?
[1:15:38] <Halospaz117> WHAT DIMITRI? WE CAN'T HEAR YOU FROM OVER THERE
[1:15:38] <%GabeSweetMan> Or MAG DEF RES if a mage.
[1:15:38] <oghalloween> k numbers go up
[1:15:40] <%FirearmsInstructor> Also hi :)
[1:15:41] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat why does the level up sound like a loony toons sfx?
[1:15:41] <DopeyDragon> Speed is best stat
[1:15:41] <%shadowxdemon0> shadowxdemon0 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:15:42] <Teaka> war god annette
[1:15:43] <Onmi_Khaos> 19 TURNS?!
[1:15:44] <$Tuskor13> @GabeSweetMan speed is also critical
[1:15:45] <xtremegamer80> Favorite knight, go
[1:15:45] <%Kataguro> Smart Grembo
[1:15:47] <%Quigsies> She cute
[1:15:48] <%sourceofall> spd most important
[1:15:49] <%DevinMayCry> Its another episode of ANETTE IS MVP
[1:15:50] <RazHarvey> was
[1:15:53] <%GabeSweetMan> Speed is also important yes.
[1:15:53] <%joylent_blue> the MVP of our hearts
[1:15:56] <Sir_Walrus> Strength and speed are the most important stats on normal and hard
[1:15:56] <%MonsterEnvy> Pat have you played Blue Lions before?
[1:15:59] <$Tuskor13> @Onmi_Khaos to be fair everyone has 4 move
[1:16:01] <ooblag> Byleth being MVP gives Renown, and ups EVERYONE'S motivation
[1:16:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Ingrid got screwed over until she could fly. Then at least she had some avoidance buffs
[1:16:06] <%joylent_blue> MonsterEnvy no
[1:16:11] <Sir_Walrus> Maddening speed is less important, dex is more important
[1:16:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> in my playthrough*
[1:16:13] <$Tuskor13> Morgana liked that
[1:16:16] <%Wynzler> Pat don't forget to stock up on those Light Blue Flower seeds
[1:16:17] <Doodle_Taco> nani
[1:16:18] <KoshiLowell> Ingrid is so weird
[1:16:19] <%barkon345> is he just restarting this with a new house?
[1:16:21] <%Monkeyweed21> @Onmi_Khaos Remember Pat is REALLY bad at strategy
[1:16:21] <KoshiLowell> she's so bad then all of a sudden
[1:16:23] <KoshiLowell> she's godlike
[1:16:26] <%Divryne> Shut up Morgana.

[1:18:06] <%RubberFistFight> So they've thought there was a world orbiting out beyond pluto for a while now thanks to weird behaviour from asteroids and shit out there. Now they think it might actually be a black hole roughly the size of a baseball.

[1:24:47] <$Tuskor13> @Copperama I think the worst part about Nowi is that her outfit being due to her being captured by slavers is actually a LOCALIZATION CHANGE. She's only on the run from slavers in translations, in Japan she just dresses like that
[1:24:49] <%aivalera> Nothing good happens to the blue lions

[1:25:40] <@StridentSong> Catherine <3
[1:25:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> This mission made me think the other houses had a different mission. It was so odd when Ashe is moping in the church and you're off to kill his dad
[1:25:42] <%Divryne> FUCK DA CHURCH.

[1:26:00] <+OkamiDude15> I’m gonna turn more than my blade on the church ms Pope
[1:26:01] <Sir_Walrus> Catherine is a good unit with a good design but her personality....bleh

[1:26:38] <Sir_Walrus> ....slightly less of a sycophant
[1:26:39] <%Wynzler> The ONLY church lover that should be protected is Mercedes
[1:26:39] <%supersugoisenpai1> Praying gets her wet

[1:26:41] <nevan0> OH MY GOD
[1:26:41] <KoshiLowell> everyone hates each other
[1:26:41] <Onmi_Khaos> Catherine does have more to her than Rhea, do her supports. She also has reasons for her focus on Rhea, owing to a lot of her backstory
[1:26:43] <zenith0111> So pure must protect the bigotry Kappa
[1:26:43] <%Fidel_Castbro> no that's Ingrid

[1:27:04] <%GabeSweetMan> DODODODODO
[1:27:11] <Doodle_Taco> The only good thing of Cyril is his supports with Lysithea, they are really cute

[1:27:52] <%Wynzler> Is Doodoo secretly gay?
[1:27:52] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger there's another remote possibility - it could be the local Mass Relay. Meaning you could get yourself an Asari harem one day Kappa
[1:27:52] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Hey, dont make fun of my wife
[1:27:54] <%Kataguro> Tell me about black dick Jesus, Dedue - Mercedes

[1:27:58] <%Kirby_Sauce> HERESY
[1:27:59] <%Divryne> I LOVE YOU MOM.
[1:27:59] <%Meidolaon> Mercedes is a genuine sweetheart
[1:28:00] <Mr_Strut> What a disgusting backwards superstition.
[1:28:00] <+NoGoodAtGames> Dedue is a pillarman

[1:28:07] <%joylent_blue> wow pat

[1:28:08] <%Typhaeon> Shouldn't he have a accent
[1:28:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Mercie accidentally went to a butcher instead of a stylist when she got her hair cut
[1:28:11] <%StaceMcGate> "All my friends are dead" Dedue
[1:28:11] <ShichiNoBushi> "I find your hethon faith amusing."
[1:28:13] <%Typhaeon> If he's a foreigner
[1:28:15] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight That is acceptable lol
[1:28:15] <%superc37> why does she have the dead anime mom haircut
[1:28:17] <KoshiLowell> "It's funny" - Pat
[1:28:21] <Sir_Walrus> Cyril’s supports with Lysithea are the one good thing about him but that’s bullshit because Lysithea is mine
[1:28:22] <%starotter70> Mercedes: just wanna tell you, never give up on your dreams
[1:28:22] <%gespenst25> THAT WE'RE ALL FUCKING DEAD. IT'S A REAL BUMMER.

[1:28:30] <%DedlokPM> My ancestors were cursed so therefore I'm cursed! rooSlain
[1:28:30] <$Tuskor13> @StaceMcGate I don't think Hilda is racist, the only times she ever hears about Almyrans is from her dad and brother who are fighting against them. If your family was at war with Russia you wouldn't hear good things about Russians
[1:28:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @superc37 that's her whole character
[1:28:30] <%gespenst25> THANKS FOR THE GENOCIDE, CHURCH.

[1:29:16] <%valriot> Ghost Loli is TECHNICALLY legal Kappa Kappa
[1:29:18] <KoshiLowell> I'd repeat it but I'm not a black person

[1:29:33] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Don't forget to lean to the side!
[1:29:37] <ShichiNoBushi> @valriot No. Because then its necrophilia.
[1:29:37] <$Tuskor13> @StaceMcGate Yeah, Hilda's racism is bred by ignorance. Ingrid knows for a fact that Dedue had nothing to do with "The Incident" and she still hates Dedue
[1:29:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> pooping

[1:31:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Sir_Walrus Wow. You nailed it.
[1:31:16] <%Kataguro> The important thing is that Pat reads dialogue and doesn't compare everyone to Naruto
[1:31:16] <%StaceMcGate> @Sir_Walrus No personality? She hogties Claude and takes his ass to their wedding
[1:31:29] <%Shadicara> How long before the mind goblins set in
[1:31:30] <%GabeSweetMan> Does she really?

[1:31:36] <KoshiLowell> Yes.
[1:31:42] <$Tuskor13> @BoboDaHobo its just there for the degenerates mostly, i assume. this is a franchise where you can marry your siblings and borderline children so marrying your stand isnt too weird

[1:32:21] <tri3dgE027> She gets better hair post-time skip though @StaceMcGate
[1:32:36] <%StaceMcGate> @tri3dgE027 I'd say she and Mercedes have worst post-time skip hair

[1:40:34] <%Wynzler> @joylent_blue yeah one of Bernadetta's original dialogues mentions something about some of the shit her dad put her through, but they patched it to be less heartbreaking

[1:41:14] <%sourceofall> the other stuff can get random stat up items
[1:41:15] <KoshiLowell> Food is more useful
[1:41:15] <%Tearonex> flowers are a good plan
[1:41:15] <$Tuskor13> @Wynzler @joylent_blue no they patched those lines because the australians are cowards who censor good character development
[1:41:16] <%Saltmeisterr> IM FUCKING DONE
[1:41:16] <%starotter70> Plant Seeds
[1:41:17] <MSN04_Sazabi> @Wynzler The actually patched that line to be closer to what it was in Japanese, the translators got a bit "creative" with it originally
[1:41:18] <+silveranthony91> Purple flower get you strenght boosters
[1:41:21] <%StaceMcGate> Ok Edelgard is for sure not worst girl, she has a plan to go to Tahiti alright?!

[1:41:58] <%miguelrod777> did you even play this game
[1:42:00] <%ShaneWhite> Focus Pat don’t freak out!
[1:42:01] <%GabeSweetMan> HIGHEST ALWAYS
[1:42:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> just do it
[1:42:03] <ooblag> ALWAYS use the best
[1:42:03] <%StaceMcGate> Pat made it to Month 8 not knowing this
[1:42:03] <%joylent_blue> sure
[1:42:03] <@StridentSong> No difference. Just Infuse them
[1:42:04] <%Kataguro> Highest always
[1:42:07] <%Meidolaon> Do it
[1:42:07] <%GabeSweetMan> They give you stat boosts
[1:42:08] <%SwdVengeance> How can this be?!?!?
[1:42:08] <%Tearonex> always do it
[1:42:10] <+silveranthony91> yes
[1:42:11] <$Tuskor13> It doesn't mean anything early on Pat, you're most likely to get multiple Weeds
[1:42:11] <%aivalera> Mot that I noticed
[1:42:12] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat The more money you spend = more plants
[1:42:13] <+A0N33> It still makes a difference and gives you more items
[1:42:13] <%GabeSweetMan> Stat boost items
[1:42:15] <%gespenst25> If number doesn't go up does it matter?
[1:42:16] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat it helps raise professor level
[1:42:16] <%Copperama> always highest, it's waste not to
[1:42:16] <%Shadicara> Watching the goblins eat his brains in this game is gonna be hilarious LUL
[1:42:21] <%joylent_blue> you have effectively infinite money on normal @AngriestPat
[1:42:22] <Xelgus> gotta throw out the whole playthrough now
[1:42:24] <%Wynzler> It's not like gold is in short supply in this game
[1:42:25] <@StridentSong> Unless the predicted yield changes, there's no difference
[1:42:27] <%Copperama> HARD DISAGREE
[1:42:32] <%king_wragles> @StridentSong oh... oh... please hold Pat's hand...this is the not good.
[1:42:38] <%Josef_Stryker> BIG DISAGREE
[1:42:39] <FoxInABeret> Shove the money into the flowers.
[1:42:39] <ooblag> It always increases the chance of getting stat up items
[1:42:41] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, raising your level is a good reason
[1:42:43] <ShichiNoBushi> Cat!
[1:42:44] <Bladeexe> They give you more food items to make to restore your students motivation.
[1:42:44] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat So the trick with the greenhouse is planting the SAME plants each time to get stat boosting items
[1:42:44] <%GabeSweetMan> It's ups the percentage chance of a Stat Boost item drop.
[1:42:46] <%CalderGaming> today's fishing show

[1:44:41] <%Copperama> why would you choose any other route than Gold, you can't recruit Hilda. So it's pointless
[1:44:41] <%starotter70> The catacombs
[1:44:41] <$Tuskor13> @FoxInABeret i was tryna workshop that joke but you did it perfectly
[1:44:44] <1matheuw> hmmusk

[1:45:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> what is musk
[1:45:08] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> A guy who likes space
[1:45:09] <Valdorick> A combo of sweat and piss.
[1:45:09] <FoxInABeret> @Tuskor13 In fairness, I'm probably the hundredth person to make that joke.
[1:45:10] <%StaceMcGate> @GabeSweetMan Best Axe Waifu is Petra, she dominates with her innate ability
[1:45:10] <%Wynzler> Musk is that smelly smell
[1:45:12] <$Tuskor13> Musk is just a way of saying smell

[1:45:19] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Did Paige have troubles coming here from Venus, and that's why she hates space?
[1:45:19] <%DedlokPM> musk is a nicer sounding way to say stink
[1:45:22] <%Cervarian> Smelly smell.... that smelly smell, what smells...
[1:45:23] <%VioletHeart> Musk is gross smell and is used an excuse by people who don't shower.
[1:45:23] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> That car guy that makes the rockets
[1:45:25] <%PanicSwytch> Natural smelly Pheromones
[1:45:27] <%Kirby_Sauce> it's the BALL STANK
[1:45:27] <%Kataguro> No it isn't
[1:45:29] <xtremegamer80> Gatekeeper
[1:45:29] <%Quigsies> That's smegma
[1:45:30] <Teaka> pretty much any bodily fluid that has pheramones/hormones in it
[1:45:30] <%gespenst25> @angriestpat my girlfriend said I have a nice musk. I don't know what to do with this intonation
[1:45:31] <%Wynzler> It's fermented dick cheese
[1:45:31] <%RubberFistFight> It's NOT dick cheese
[1:45:31] <xtremegamer80> Go talk to him
[1:45:31] <cureneckbeard> I make big smell.
[1:45:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> It's Body Odor
[1:45:33] <nevan0> LOL
[1:45:33] <%GabeSweetMan> @StaceMcGate Fair.
[1:45:34] <luckyifpurple> Just remember woman are responsible for 100% of space crimes, stay safe kings
[1:45:34] <rhus> It is NOT THAT
[1:45:35] <%AncelDeLambert> musk is an oily excretion left specifically for its scent
[1:45:35] <%Charuzu> I just thought it was BO
[1:45:36] <$Tuskor13> Stop talking about dick cheese
[1:45:37] <%skizzuto> it's not, it's body odor
[1:45:37] <damienlunas> It's animal sex odor
[1:45:39] <ShichiNoBushi> It is strong animal odor particularly in mammals. What skunks spray is musk.
[1:45:39] <xtremegamer80> GATEKEEPER
[1:45:40] <Valdorick> Smegma is the true Cum Hazard.
[1:45:44] <%Deadpal> Right. Not dick cheese. Just Deoderant.
[1:45:45] <Quietshun13> you can recruit hilda on blue lions and church routes
[1:45:45] <Mr_Strut> It's man stank. Bitches love it.
[1:45:46] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat which of these girls do you refuse to spill the paint on?
[1:45:47] <PaPaSeppuku> musk is a candy
[1:45:53] <1matheuw> its a pokemon
[1:45:56] <xtremegamer80> @AngriestPat Go talk to Gatekeeper
[1:45:57] <%RubberFistFight> I could explain it relatively easily but I'm kinda afraid to because I don't want to get in trouble for being inappropriate LUL
[1:45:58] <%solidousstream> @rubberfistfight it's a little dick cheese.
[1:45:59] <%Zulrez> @AngriestPat "a strong-smelling reddish-brown substance which is secreted by the male musk deer for scent-marking and is an important ingredient in perfumery." these bitches be sniffing deer
[1:46:01] <%valriot> ELON SMEGMA
[1:46:07] <Valdorick> Musk is men's perfume.
[1:46:15] <%bevyrage> musk is like a heavy, humid aroma. usually equated to general body odor but you also will get it when outside after it rains but the heat is also happening
[1:46:17] <n33t_1337> BLUE LIONS BEST HOUSE
[1:46:17] <%joylent_blue> battalions on NG+ are so fun
[1:46:18] <%GabeSweetMan> I heard ITALIANS
[1:46:19] <%Kirby_Sauce> @AngriestPat musk is some guy named Elon
[1:46:20] <Doodle_Taco> @valriot Actually reporting this
[1:46:23] <%TomDanksEGOT> @AngriestPat you were just talking on the podcast last week about when you need ot wash your balls, the reason is the musk
[1:46:25] <%GabeSweetMan> I kept hearing ITALIANS
[1:46:26] <Mr_Strut> It's actually anal cheese.
[1:46:31] <%GabeSweetMan> All this ITALIANS runnin' around
[1:46:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I was half paying attention and thought Dimitri said Italians lose endurance
[1:46:34] <%Dr00_PhD> Stride is fantastic
[1:46:36] <%StaceMcGate> Stride is great to give to healers
[1:46:36] <%bevyrage> especially when you live in an area with carp dying on the banks

[1:46:46] <%RubberFistFight> @Zulrez there's an "expanded" definition that includes human smells as well. I think the definition you provided is only musk as a compound, not a scent.

[1:48:12] <%Meidolaon> Elmo clearly likes Sothis
[1:48:14] <King_Wolf_Rigger> He was unarmoured at the time
[1:48:18] <%terribleusername> canadian supermarkets are known danger zones

[2:14:16] <+xddddsorandom> she's better though
[2:14:20] <%Sokumotanaka> DON'T FEAT THAT THING AFTER MIDNIGHT!
[2:14:21] <+BIumen> remember to get her to support B and you dont need to focus on stats
[2:14:24] <%starotter70> Hmm
[2:14:25] <%PanicSwytch> @angriestpat Are we getting a Shitstorm?
[2:14:25] <%Kataguro> Pat, read the descriptions
[2:14:25] <poweredscoot> Hmm
[2:14:26] <%valriot> Ultra Gremlin
[2:14:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @InugamiTheHound Matt's doing one. Someone dubbed it the "Poo Typhoon"
[2:14:27] <+Grayhammatter> hmm

[2:14:29] <%mh9s> hmm
[2:14:34] <%KitsuneManami> Hmm
[2:14:35] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat gifts/lost item also raise motivation, so save them
[2:14:37] <xtremegamer80> @AngriestPat Just get a chart for gifts

[2:14:53] <%aivalera> Clap
[2:14:57] <savage_howitzer> yep sounds right.
[2:14:58] <%zamzoph> no, brute force it
[2:15:00] <Doodle_Taco> I have a THOT
[2:15:08] <FoxInABeret> I think there's a spreadsheet somewhere on the FE subreddit. I have it saved to my Google Drive.
[2:15:10] <%KitsuneManami> Wow Pauldrens
[2:15:11] <%PanicSwytch> No shitstorms Pat?
[2:15:14] <savage_howitzer> @doodle_taco where.
[2:15:15] <%StaceMcGate> Only issue with the B-Support method is reloading each week if they don't request to join
[2:15:16] <+sunriser696> so weird listening to the english voices after 3 playthoughts with japanese audio
[2:15:18] <%InugamiTheHound> @Sphincter_Spelunker that's pretty funny. My favorite moment is "mysterious jogos"
[2:15:24] <%Shadicara> Make them all submit to your crusade pat
[2:15:25] <+peri_d0t> hi Pat. is this your first blue lion run?
[2:15:30] <%kewlmyc> Is this Pat's 2nd playthrough?
[2:15:31] <xtremegamer80> Actually I read that A-Rank autorecruits people, all the ranks before just lower the requisities
[2:15:32] <%starotter70> Doesn't B rank just lower the requirements to like D rank
[2:15:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> Are you a teacher who is trying to bang his students? Is that what this is?
[2:15:42] <+Tyonidus> Yo, how did Pat like Code Vein guys?
[2:15:50] <%starotter70> D rank for weapon stuff
[2:15:50] <+ahdurian> GET BERNIE
[2:15:51] <Onmi_Khaos> No we're a teacher trying to train our students
[2:15:55] <%StaceMcGate> B Rank ignores the stat requirement, as they randomly join your house during the week
[2:15:57] <Quietshun13> you can't bang them until they're all legal
[2:15:58] <+Grayhammatter> get bernie though
[2:15:59] <Onmi_Khaos> We don't fuck them until long after they're adults
[2:16:00] <Doodle_Taco> GET BERNIE
[2:16:01] <@StridentSong> Use the map to locate people
[2:16:01] <shozent> Make sure to recruit Bernie pat
[2:16:03] <%legendfather_of_giants> @xtremegamer80 once you reach B, they randomly ask some day that month, you don't need to ask them
[2:16:04] <RazHarvey> feel the burn Kreygasm
[2:16:06] <Retinolgaming> I'm on NG++ Golden deer, and I just bought support ranks for everyone LUL.
[2:16:08] <+hitorio> Is this classic mode?
[2:16:09] <%StaceMcGate> Only people you cannot B-Support are Caspar and Ferdinand
[2:16:13] <simulationbard> Those are some stiff fucking coat arms
[2:16:15] <+sunriser696> we are "training" our students wink
[2:16:18] <+johnny_volcano> Blue Lions are a good group of kids
[2:16:19] <+peri_d0t> hope you're liking the lions pat
[2:16:19] <%Nobrev> you can find peoples location on the map screen
[2:16:19] <+ahdurian> I think the D is in the student grounds shit
[2:16:19] <%shurtal> hey, it's that dog
[2:16:20] <%KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat How far in Code Anime Are you?
[2:16:21] <%Zulrez> @AngriestPat is he hanging out with his buds mike leo and donny?
[2:16:24] <gordieda20> SPEED
[2:16:26] <%InugamiTheHound> burnie burns??
[2:16:30] <+johnny_volcano> That's Byleth running from Manuela's thirst
[2:16:31] <+hitorio> Well, now that I think about it, I've never heard of a streamer not doing classic mode
[2:16:32] <%Kataguro> Can't get exhausted if you don't have a heartrate
[2:16:32] <%StaceMcGate> Hilda will also not join Black Eagles
[2:16:37] <%stemlo_> I AM SPEED
[2:16:37] <+Grayhammatter> Deja VU
[2:16:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @InugamiTheHound that's up there. Them being afraid of the police guy in Cthulu who only told them to leave everytime is mine
[2:16:43] <xtremegamer80> His shirt couldn't contain his size
[2:16:48] <Doodle_Taco> @stacemcgate Based Hilda
[2:16:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> Code Vein is a good game that is tring to be a bad anime.
[2:17:00] <RazHarvey> wait, we're streaming? PogChamp
[2:17:00] <%starotter70> @StaceMcGate That fucked me up cause you still get Lost Items for her, but you can't give them
[2:17:06] <+HyperCharge_Sam> the rewind mechanic kind of makes classic mode pointless anyways
[2:17:07] <+peri_d0t> Pat do you have a favorite student at the moment?
[2:17:08] <%Meidolaon> Streeeeaaaaam iiiiiit
[2:17:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> you're streaming it now
[2:17:11] <%InugamiTheHound> @Sphincter_Spelunker oh yeah the freaky fish guy that scared the shit out of them.
[2:17:15] <$GoopyAvacado> i thought you were taking a break?
[2:17:15] <DSD24> @rumtumtugnutz Still has a fun story
[2:17:23] <%42nfl19> So based on what you said @AngriestPat , with enougn NG+ you can eventualy recruit everyone?
[2:17:25] <%Monkeyweed21> When's Indivisible @AngriestPat ?
[2:17:26] <poweredscoot> 0 shits given
[2:17:27] <%InugamiTheHound> isn't every week "not give a shit week" for pat?
[2:17:29] <cant_pick_a_name> thats every week for you pat
[2:17:32] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Let's keep this up, I'm liking this FE playthrough thing. I wanna see what you think about this storyline.
[2:17:33] <%snow_bush> FUCK YOU ITS OCTOBER
[2:17:34] <tacomaster740> he's taking a break on giving a shit
[2:17:35] <voltage996> Isn’t that every week Kappa
[2:17:37] <Graywolf_the_45th> @AngriestPat you thinking of doing any more streams for this game?
[2:17:39] <+G_Thunders> I liked the Black Eagles story way more than the Blue Lions, but that was probably cause I never liked Dimitri all that much
[2:17:40] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat What are you doing on your week off?
[2:17:42] <bruno_silv0> think about what you just said for a second pat
[2:17:48] <DSD24> Lysithea is best GD girl
[2:17:51] <%Charuzu> today = week seems legit
[2:17:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> @DSD24 not disagreeing. I like the shlockiness of it.
[2:18:00] <+peri_d0t> sometimes your best isn't enough
[2:18:05] <%InugamiTheHound> that sounds like fun
[2:18:06] <%Meidolaon> Boy though I hope we eventually get a full LP
[2:18:07] <savage_howitzer> noice
[2:18:17] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I don't get the hate for casual difficulty.
[2:18:17] <Onmi_Khaos> Already got your Falcon mount @AngriestPat
[2:18:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> sleeping and pooping.
[2:18:32] <%Meidolaon> Leonie's stalker map
[2:18:33] <+peri_d0t> do you have a favorite student yet Pat?
[2:18:36] <DSD24> @rumtumtugnutz I guess I wouldn't describe it as bad anime but I get what you mean
[2:18:38] <%Charuzu> sounds cathartic
[2:18:39] <%StaceMcGate> Problem with Blue Lions story is that it entirely focuses on its lord, moreso than the other routes
[2:18:46] <Onmi_Khaos> In FFXIV, the Falcon mount for the Irregular Tomestone event
[2:18:55] <simulationbard> I'm so glad Destiny 2's free now. Warframe's fun but it doesn't quite scratch the same itch
[2:18:58] <Onmi_Khaos> To clarify: The Falcon Airship
[2:19:01] <DSD24> @StaceMcGate Dimitri needs all the help he can get

[2:19:31] <%king_wragles> Weeding raises heavy armor skill?
[2:19:32] <%StaceMcGate> @peri_d0t Nah, I liked Black Eagles other perspective of the issue and Claude's answer questions not answered in the other two
[2:19:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Yeah, I kinda fucked that up. Had Cyril and Dedue get Heavy Armor training half my run
[2:19:33] <%Shadicara> No one wants to be friends with doodoo Kappa
[2:19:38] <%aivalera> Er, you might want to wait on dedue's supports
[2:19:40] <RazHarvey> you taught him how to love
[2:19:40] <savage_howitzer> @king_wragles ye
[2:19:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> this game has bondage? I thought you weren't tryna fuck your students.
[2:19:41] <DSD24> Great Pat you are the teacher that does group projects

[2:19:54] <%miguelrod777> dont even worry about his mount options
[2:19:56] <%daws_combine> daws_combine subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! With Divinity on Switch and supporting Steam save migration, will you stop being such a coward and finish Planescape?
[2:19:59] <+theotherkristian> Everyone is actually stupid busted. Also someone eats grass
[2:19:59] <%StaceMcGate> Don't bother with Bow
[2:20:02] <+peri_d0t> @stacemcgate to each their own I suppose
[2:20:11] <shozent> PAT TEACH THEM WHAT THEYRE GOOD AT
[2:20:11] <%RubberFistFight> God, I wish video output hardware existed for the 3DS-XL. There was that one card but the dude went out of business and nobody stepped in to develop an alternative, and that wireless streaming method sucks ass.
[2:20:16] <+HyperCharge_Sam> I upgraded bow and I totally regreted it
[2:20:19] <savage_howitzer> @king_wragles idk game mechanic doodAnime
[2:20:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> teach her how to dougie
[2:20:29] <+conradical> most of the women on my teams ended up as Gremories
[2:20:29] <Retinolgaming> She's the best healer in the game.
[2:20:31] <%Kataguro> Teach Felix Reason, Pat
[2:20:31] <%aivalera> Bow's useful just for her unique abilty
[2:20:35] <shozent> YES
[2:20:35] <%Kataguro> Yes
[2:20:35] <%aivalera> YES
[2:20:35] <%StaceMcGate> @peri_d0t Yeah, nothing against Dimitri (he is great) but as Blue Lions was my third, I was not interested
[2:20:38] <zenith0111> rmzRAGE
[2:20:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> rally or horse
[2:20:39] <+theotherkristian> No
[2:20:40] <%bread_assassin> When it doubt, Authority.
[2:20:40] <+peri_d0t> YES
[2:20:40] <+BIumen> horse and lance
[2:20:41] <kingkeldeo31> has Pat seen the Dudue/Dimitri weed thing?
[2:20:41] <shozent> GIVE HIM MORE SPEAR
[2:20:42] <IsaiahOmega> huh i did the exact weeding pair with Dedue and Ingrid to raise supports
[2:20:42] <%miguelrod777> horse no lance yes
[2:20:44] <+ahdurian> horse
[2:20:44] <%legendfather_of_giants> needs riding for master classes @AngriestPat
[2:20:45] <+theotherkristian> Dont do it
[2:20:46] <4skore> YES
[2:20:47] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Give him horse
[2:20:47] <Doodle_Taco> SPEAR
[2:20:48] <%aivalera> NOOOO Sword lance and authoritry
[2:20:49] <%kewlmyc> Kinda, until the timeskip
[2:20:50] <Sir_Walrus> No not horse
[2:20:52] <+runningfleet> NO HORSE
[2:20:52] <Eightgutter> spears
[2:20:56] <+hitorio> Streams with HUDs that show the whole feax-physical 3DS are interface porn to me.
[2:20:57] <+peri_d0t> Dimitri is arguably the best in the game
[2:20:58] <+theotherkristian> dont listen to the people who played this game. dont
[2:20:59] <%Punchasaur> @rumtumtugnutz wow I haven’t heard that in fucking years
[2:20:59] <Onmi_Khaos> He gets his master class automatically
[2:21:00] <bruno_silv0> just spear tbh
[2:21:01] <%Shadicara> MORE HORSE
[2:21:01] <ooblag> Yeah, Horse gives him something to do until you get his unique class
[2:21:04] <phatballlz54> raise every last one of them
[2:21:05] <shozent> @AngriestPat MIN MAX THIS GAME PAT, MIN MAX
[2:21:06] <+silveranthony91> make him a wyvern lord
[2:21:08] <savage_howitzer> yes horse
[2:21:09] <%StaceMcGate> Dimitri needs something to do before time skip chat
[2:21:09] <Sir_Walrus> FailFish
[2:21:10] <+sunriser696> he gets his master classes for free
[2:21:15] <RazHarvey> horsey stat worst stat apparently
[2:21:15] <+theotherkristian> make him dance
[2:21:17] <%Kataguro> Teach Vergil death magic
[2:21:18] <%aivalera> Sword and authority for the lord class
[2:21:25] <+ahdurian> train Annette because she's wife
[2:21:30] <IsaiahOmega> Horse is good
[2:21:32] <+HyperCharge_Sam> you can still max horse classes for some good passives tho
[2:21:32] <4skore> felix
[2:21:32] <chaseyd> A star gets added every 4 studies. So in 2 more sessions he'll have that horsey ability.
[2:21:33] <zenith0111> Happiness Meters rmzNANI
[2:21:35] <Sir_Walrus> Do not give Felix reason
[2:21:36] <%bread_assassin> Even for Felix, the late gate battalions are much better than the boost from his personal skill.
[2:21:40] <%StaceMcGate> Lord Class is garbage, Res+ 3 ability?
[2:21:43] <FoxInABeret> Horsey stat does give Mov +1... just sayin'.
[2:21:45] <Sir_Walrus> Mortal Savant is bad
[2:21:49] <+ahdurian> oh god
[2:21:53] <+peri_d0t> @sir_walrus but his reason skill is great
[2:21:54] <DSD24> Felix is a massive dick
[2:21:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Punchasaur yeah, I'm not sure why it came to mind but its in the wild now
[2:22:01] <%sl8r4l8r> teach Felix Judgement cut
[2:22:02] <jkfd> mortal savant is bad since when
[2:22:03] <%Punchasaur> Bone mercy- I mean Mercedes
[2:22:04] <+Grayhammatter> you're gonna do good kid
[2:22:07] <%Kataguro> Felix gets Thoron which means artillery option
[2:22:09] <+peri_d0t> felix fucking sucks
[2:22:09] <%StaceMcGate> All master classes are bad, they are all hybrids
[2:22:11] <DarkOmen98> felix is an amazing mortal savant @Sir_Walrus the growth guide is wrong
[2:22:16] <+peri_d0t> @jkfd since always
[2:22:16] <Sir_Walrus> @jkfd -10% speed growth
[2:22:22] <+peri_d0t> ^
[2:22:24] <+theotherkristian> Just call him vergil
[2:22:26] <%Kataguro> Pure Bow or Bow and Sword
[2:22:29] <RazHarvey> cuz ur drunk
[2:22:29] <Retinolgaming> Ashe can be a god bow knight
[2:22:30] <jkfd> @Sir_Walrus it doesn't matter.
[2:22:30] <DarkOmen98> he can one shot fools and with his magic it just makes him OP as all hell
[2:22:31] <%Kataguro> For Assassin
[2:22:31] <%GabeSweetMan> @StaceMcGate I agree. I don't like that they are not the results of PURE min-max.
[2:22:32] <Quietshun13> so falcon knight is worse than pegasus knight?
[2:22:32] <%tyler274> axe for wyvern knight
[2:22:35] <Onmi_Khaos> To get him into Bandit so he can learn Deathblow? I dunno
[2:22:38] <%aivalera> He does better in Axes than he does lance tbhj
[2:22:38] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat axe is a good secondary for him
[2:22:39] <%Punchasaur> She’s the crazy church girl so you know it’s 👌🏻
[2:22:41] <+theotherkristian> Ashe is best girl | Dont change my mind
[2:22:44] <%Josef_Stryker> All to kill his dad
[2:22:47] <shozent> @AngriestPat By the end of the game if you Min Max your stats, you'll barely reach the skill cap
[2:22:48] <4skore> customization there goals
[2:22:49] <%Shadicara> Train to shoot his dad in the head
[2:22:49] <ooblag> the -10% speed growth means nothing. it amounts to like 1.5 speed. It's less than nothing
[2:22:52] <+Grayhammatter> that's the do it
[2:22:52] <%Kataguro> C L O S E C O U N T E R
[2:22:52] <RazHarvey> like a true hero would
[2:22:54] <Onmi_Khaos> CLOSE COUNTER
[2:22:56] <%StaceMcGate> Huge issue with Pegasus knight is that there is nothing inbetween Advanced and Master classes for them
[2:22:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> here we go
[2:22:58] <%Laecerelius> Now he can murder his dad even more efficiently
[2:23:02] <+ahdurian> 2
[2:23:04] <jkfd> @Sir_Walrus by the time you switch him into MS he'll double up on everything forever
[2:23:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> don't fuck up

[2:23:20] <Doodle_Taco> 2 I think
[2:23:22] <DSD24> Can we talk about how awesome Catherine is?
[2:23:22] <%aivalera> Nope, it was one
[2:23:24] <%Divryne> NOPE.
[2:23:25] <Sir_Walrus> @ooblag except you need to compare it to like swordmaster which has +20% speed growth
[2:23:27] <%GabeSweetMan> Most important for professor level.

[2:23:28] <oruandrew> no actually it was 1

[2:23:43] <%ryome> Look to your left, look to your right, one of you will kill your dad

[2:23:47] <%aivalera> It also gives you a ton of prof exp
[2:23:49] <%kewlmyc> Yes, axe is pointless on him
[2:23:49] <shozent> Mostly bow
[2:23:51] <IsaiahOmega> Ashe becomes a ridiculous archer

[2:29:55] <+ZenVulgarity> Big Baby Bitch Pat
[2:29:55] <%Meidolaon> Got it
[2:29:58] <%MisterTylerrr> Baby bitch boivin
[2:29:59] <DSD24> @Sphincter_Spelunker He got updated pretty recently actually
[2:29:59] <%Josef_Stryker> At least make him a Paladin in the meantime
[2:30:01] <shozent> NO PAT, TEACH HIM LANCES
[2:30:01] <Onmi_Khaos> You can teach him, because it makes him stronger
[2:30:02] <%MonsterEnvy> You should teach him, cause he gets better stuff.
[2:30:03] <redrins> you should teach him
[2:30:03] <+HyperCharge_Sam> no, you can still unlock passives with him
[2:30:03] <tri3dgE027> All Lords get their Master-Class for Free
[2:30:04] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat he gets his classes post time skip, so he needs something to do until then
[2:30:04] <+FatherGreyBeard> sourPls
[2:30:04] <Quietshun13> thats not what that means
[2:30:05] <FoxInABeret> DJ Normal Baby Bitch Shit
[2:30:05] <Onmi_Khaos> But all his class ups are free
[2:30:06] <%genowyn> You want his skills to be good though
[2:30:07] <%GummiBunnies> grind up for advanced class to get unique mastery skill
[2:30:07] <DSD24> Lysithea the best girl
[2:30:10] <Pirate_Jesus> Gotta teach the best boy
[2:30:13] <%bread_assassin> He still benefits from skills though.
[2:30:13] <ooblag> No, you still need to unlock Abilities
[2:30:14] <%BoboDaHobo> he still benefits from stat growth though
[2:30:16] <Doodle_Taco> TEACH HIM LANCES
[2:30:19] <KingRipoff1> nah its still good to teach him and get him to at least am advanced class
[2:30:20] <DawnsRoyal> you should still teach him lance /authority
[2:30:23] <sosuke5> Training wheels on this bitch
[2:30:24] <MSN04_Sazabi> "He couldn't do it"
[2:30:26] <+Grayhammatter> he cannot do it
[2:30:29] <RazHarvey> this game has too many waifus
[2:30:29] <%MonsterEnvy> Lance and Authority is what he wants
[2:30:31] <Doodle_Taco> Lysithea "Dark spikes T" Ordelia
[2:30:32] <+sunriser696> skills make him stronger and let him use more weapon options
[2:30:33] <Sir_Walrus> @angriestpat no you should still teach him for the abilities and combat arts he gets
[2:30:33] <%aivalera> @AngriestPat All you need to do is teach Dim Sword Lance and authority, maybe horse if you master his Lord class
[2:30:34] <Graywolf_the_45th> ITEMS
[2:30:36] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat It's good to teach him. Just means you don't need to worry about teaching him much else but Lance.
[2:30:39] <+FatherGreyBeard> Raise Dimitri's LANCE skill.
[2:30:43] <%Kuro_Koshka> Go to items and click the magic you egg
[2:30:45] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat There are no classes past beginner that only utilize Lances, so he needs riding or he'll suck
[2:30:48] <ooblag> What are you trying to do?
[2:30:48] <Onmi_Khaos> @AngriestPat Raise his Authority stat
[2:30:53] <%GabeSweetMan> You gotta finish your thoughts if you want us to help you
[2:30:57] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat he only gets it post-timeskip, so he'll suck until then if you don't teach him
[2:30:58] <+vdalson> steakRIP
[2:31:06] <tri3dgE027> Authority is arguably the best Stat to teach if their weapon proficiency is already at B+ above\
[2:31:12] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[2:31:13] <reonome> LUL
[2:31:14] <phatballlz54> bad roll
[2:31:18] <shozent> Big OOF

[2:31:22] <%Punchasaur> Raise dimitri’s sword and leadership so he can be lordboi
[2:31:26] <bruno_silv0> lysithea with the range perks is the most broken shit in the game
[2:31:27] <%GummiBunnies> better battalions
[2:31:27] <%Shadicara> LUL
[2:31:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @AngriestPat battalions
[2:31:28] <Daniel_Is_I> Authority = can equip better battalions
[2:31:30] <%zamzoph> Points of Authority
[2:31:30] <RazHarvey> does anything affect stats?
[2:31:30] <ooblag> It's AMAZING
[2:31:30] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Authority lets you use advance gambit
[2:31:31] <%genowyn> Better authority lets you use bette rbattalions
[2:31:31] <%MonsterEnvy> Aurthoirty lets you equip better battalions
[2:31:31] <%sourceofall> it lets you equip better battalions
[2:31:32] <worldbrand> Gambits and battalions
[2:31:33] <%mh9s> battalions lad
[2:31:34] <Ominnous> Authority = battalion effectivness
[2:31:34] <%aivalera> Authority allows you to equip boss ass battalions that break the game
[2:31:35] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat I mean battalions
[2:31:35] <+HyperCharge_Sam> Authority powers up your Gambits
[2:31:36] <Quietshun13> you need better authority to use better battalions
[2:31:36] <Graywolf_the_45th> Authority gives better battalions
[2:31:36] <%sl8r4l8r> ANARCHISTPAT
[2:31:36] <KingRipoff1> makes your gambits big and good
[2:31:37] <+sunriser696> better battalions = more stats
[2:31:38] <Onmi_Khaos> @AngriestPat Authority is used to equip batallions, Batallions are broken.
[2:31:39] <Doodle_Taco> Authoritt gives you batallions
[2:31:39] <Retinolgaming> It boosts your battallions.
[2:31:39] <%Binary_Fireball> these are the most polite and kind sounding group of killers ever
[2:31:40] <%Punchasaur> For lord
[2:31:40] <%legendfather_of_giants> battalion stats and gambit damage
[2:31:41] <kingkeldeo31> Authority is for gambits
[2:31:44] <+nekodelic> "I don't understand authority"
[2:31:45] <%GabeSweetMan> Battalions are basically spells. And they are GOOD spells.
[2:31:45] <%aivalera> It also allows you to use Rally skills
[2:31:46] <Daniel_Is_I> @RazHarvey Better battalions give more stats
[2:31:46] <%tyler274> Authority lets you use powerful batallions that buff your stats
[2:31:47] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat Lets you equip better battalions for better bonuses
[2:31:47] <DawnsRoyal> better battalions which give crazy stats later
[2:31:49] <%supersugoisenpai1> Let's you get better battalions
[2:31:49] <tri3dgE027> @AngriestPat it allows you to equip Battalions. Authority Rank E = no Battalion
[2:31:49] <%Shadicara> Better batallions
[2:31:50] <%sourceofall> battallions= lots of free stats
[2:31:54] <jkfd> are gambits even necessary on normal mode?
[2:31:55] <%Meidolaon> @AngriestPat Authority is used for Battallion usage
[2:31:57] <phatballlz54> meh roll
[2:31:57] <%BoboDaHobo> makes your battalion options better and you get better stat boosts from them
[2:31:58] <poweredscoot> always pray for rng
[2:31:58] <%MonsterEnvy> Better Battalions gigve lots of free stats
[2:31:59] <%Punchasaur> Respect it
[2:31:59] <lokiluko> good battalions are huge stat boosts
[2:32:02] <RazHarvey> @Daniel_Is_I on nice thx
[2:32:03] <+sunriser696> Better Battalions = Very Big, Very Strong
[2:32:04] <ooblag> Authority is the Battalion skill. Battalions ARE REALLY GOOD once you get the better ones
[2:32:06] <RazHarvey> oh*
[2:32:07] <+peri_d0t> @jkfd no but they useful
[2:32:10] <%starotter70> YES
[2:32:11] <%legendfather_of_giants> high-level battalions need high authority, but give CRAZY stats @AngriestPat
[2:32:11] <%AncelDeLambert> oh Pat
[2:32:12] <+ZenVulgarity> YES
[2:32:12] <+Grayhammatter> you will
[2:32:14] <%GabeSweetMan> YES
[2:32:14] <%Kuro_Koshka> Pat WTF
[2:32:14] <redrins> they're REALLY good
[2:32:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> How did you fight monsters
[2:32:15] <%mh9s> YES PAT
[2:32:15] <%Binary_Fireball> like give me a hug and call me muffin.... then stab a motherfucker
[2:32:15] <+peri_d0t> yes
[2:32:15] <Onjani> Absolutely
[2:32:16] <Ominnous> they're broken if you spec into authority
[2:32:16] <+djinnJuice> they're crazy good
[2:32:16] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Yes
[2:32:16] <Doodle_Taco> YES
[2:32:17] <+LazinAsian> Some battalions are broken
[2:32:17] <%tyler274> as passive stat boosters yes
[2:32:17] <Retinolgaming> Some are good. Some suck.
[2:32:17] <Quietshun13> battalions are amazing
[2:32:19] <%aivalera> They give you a flat boost to your skillls
[2:32:19] <Graywolf_the_45th> Battallions are really fuckin good
[2:32:20] <Sir_Walrus> @angriestpat authority allows you to equip stronger battalions, which give better stat buffs and better gambits
[2:32:21] <%GabeSweetMan> They're AMAZING
[2:32:21] <lokiluko> outragiously good, game changing
[2:32:21] <+HyperCharge_Sam> you get passive stats and some pretty good abilities alongside it
[2:32:21] <ooblag> MASSIVLEY good
[2:32:22] <%Kuro_Koshka> Batallions can give like +6 to atk and def by the end
[2:32:22] <tri3dgE027> It gets semi-required after Chapter 4
[2:32:22] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat YES, they raise your stats and do AOE damage. Needed for monsters
[2:32:22] <%BoboDaHobo> you'll use them a lot more later on
[2:32:22] <%Divryne> WHAT THE FUCK PAT.
[2:32:22] <Laveyrin> they are free stats
[2:32:23] <%GummiBunnies> big gambits that cover the screen are super useful for breaking monster armor in one turn lol
[2:32:23] <%Meidolaon> REALLY GOOD
[2:32:24] <Ominnous> but you don't need battalions
[2:32:25] <%Shadicara> YES
[2:32:25] <shozent> You'll DEF want to use Battalions later in the game
[2:32:27] <%supersugoisenpai1> YES
[2:32:29] <Onmi_Khaos> @AngriestPat There is a batallion that gives everyone +6 movement for the turn. Does that sound good?
[2:32:29] <Sir_Walrus> Battalions are great
[2:32:30] <kingkeldeo31> They become super busted
[2:32:31] <%Divryne> Batallions let you attack FOR FREE.
[2:32:33] <%Kuro_Koshka> BATALLIONS MAKE BIGGER NUMBER PAT
[2:32:33] <@StridentSong> Not only are they stat sticks for the person you put them on, but they're invaluable against monsteres
[2:32:34] <%marsanta> Is this critical game mechanic worth using?
[2:32:34] <%VioletHeart> Batallions give passive stat buffs to units and are free attacks enemies can't counter. They're AMAZING.
[2:32:34] <%Tearonex> they're good for the attack AND stat bonuses
[2:32:35] <%sourceofall> they are just equipment that give a bunch of free stats
[2:32:35] <%Nobrev> you should because they're amazing and one of the main mechanics of the game
[2:32:36] <DawnsRoyal> there stat buffs are reeeaaaaly good
[2:32:37] <jkfd> @AngriestPat they are great.
[2:32:38] <%GabeSweetMan> Stat boosts
[2:32:40] <%aivalera> for example, one battalions give you +5 def for free
[2:32:40] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat they give free stats
[2:32:41] <RazHarvey> so i guess they're good for breaking the game?
[2:32:42] <Quietshun13> you dont need them in normal, or even hard but theyre super good
[2:32:46] <%GabeSweetMan> Stat boost and good spell
[2:32:46] <%bread_assassin> They're real good since they can cause splash damage and opponents can't counter.
[2:32:48] <%GummiBunnies> JUST dont give felix a battalion
[2:32:50] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat raise your stats, aoe damage, cc, and for destroying monster barriers
[2:32:50] <ooblag> HUGE stat bonuses and GREAT skills
[2:32:51] <voltage996> Pat you upset me
[2:32:53] <+peri_d0t> all of the above
[2:32:53] <%starotter70> Stat Buff and Some Really powerful moves
[2:32:54] <Daniel_Is_I> stat boosts and big aoe skills
[2:32:55] <+djinnJuice> good stats, can't counter, aoe damage
[2:32:55] <+sunriser696> Some Gambits are realy good, but the stats are amazing
[2:32:55] <%BoboDaHobo> they give free stats and strong attacks
[2:32:55] <%Kuro_Koshka> Even if you don't use gambits batallions give free stats :v
[2:32:56] <%Punchasaur> It’s a temp buff Kappa
[2:32:59] <%Divryne> Battalions boost your characters stats and enemies don't attack you when you use them.
[2:33:05] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat high authority batallions can give like +20 total
[2:33:08] <tri3dgE027> They provide passive Stats to your Child-Soldiers @AngriestPat , also you need them to deal with certain enemy types after they are introduced in Chapter 4-5
[2:33:09] <+Grayhammatter> felix doesn't like battalions
[2:33:11] <ShershaAD> @angriestpat hey pat, so i was watching yoir ff15 stream and am curious to know, did you ever stream episode ignis?
[2:33:11] <FoxInABeret> Free stats, attack multiple enemies with no possible counterattack, effective against monsters.
[2:33:13] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Stat Boost and special moves (heal, stop enemies in their tracks, etc.)
[2:33:17] <DawnsRoyal> many free stats and good abilites against later enemies
[2:33:21] <%GabeSweetMan> OOF
[2:33:21] <%aivalera> @AngriestPat They also have really busted abilities, such as stride and a move that makes the enmy do only one damge
[2:33:22] <%bread_assassin> Like one just give Mov + 5 to the party.
[2:33:24] <+peri_d0t> they give you free windslash too
[2:33:25] <%MonsterEnvy> Felix gets plus 5 damage, without a Battalion, but Eventually Battalions will give better stats that will eclipse that
[2:33:26] <%Shadicara> Free stats and more options there's literally no downside LUL
[2:33:30] <shozent> @AngriestPat They attack without being hit back, can stun foes, break shields, and do AOE damage
[2:33:30] <reonome> wow those rolls
[2:33:37] <+Carpe_Deez_Nuts> damage battalions gambits also cripple enemies for a turn, so it's smart if there are a bunch of tough enemies around a weak character
[2:33:38] <%GabeSweetMan> Authority is really EASY to grind too.
[2:33:39] <%StaceMcGate> Not giving Felix a battalion is a mistake, he gets 5 damage for not having one. Not worth having him go lone wolf
[2:33:40] <jkfd> @AngriestPat they are very nice to break monster armor to farm rare ores.
[2:33:43] <Quietshun13> felix should equip a battalion if it gives him 5 strength
[2:33:47] <Sir_Walrus> @angriestpat Battalions give free stats, and big AoE attacks that cannot be counterattacked and prevent enemies from moving next turn and gives them massive debuffs
[2:33:50] <%RubberFistFight> I'm considering 3D printing a 120dB whistle and blowing it down the phone at these fucking scam callers.
[2:33:55] <%GabeSweetMan> Just equip any garbage battalion and just tank hits on a heal space.
[2:33:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @MonsterEnvy which is nice when the battalion runs low
[2:34:01] <+tire_marqs> ingrids dead
[2:34:05] <%StaceMcGate> @Quietshun13 you have that backwards, if felix doesn't have a battalion he gets 5 bonus damage
[2:34:05] <GPAlpha> Battalions = Me and the Boys attack
[2:34:10] <ShershaAD> @angriestpat hey pat, so i was watching your ff15 stream and am curious to know, did you ever stream episode ignis?
[2:34:14] <+FatherGreyBeard> Why did they change Armor Knight to axe focus...
[2:34:14] <ooblag> Bushes give HUGE dodge bonuses, especially on already dodgy units like Mymidons
[2:34:19] <%aivalera> @AngriestPat Battlions also level up your authority for free, which gradually allows you to have even better battalions
[2:34:27] <%GabeSweetMan> NICE

[2:34:46] <%Shadicara> Big huge felix
[2:34:48] <Quietshun13> oh yeah I know, but if a battalion gives him 5 strength then he loses nothing and gains a battalion attack
[2:34:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Power! More Power
[2:34:48] <Doodle_Taco> I hope we get to see Felix's and Anette's supports

[2:35:56] <Graywolf_the_45th> Pat is a tactical genius
[2:35:56] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> =/
[2:35:56] <+runningfleet> is this on classic
[2:35:57] <Onjani> F but not real F
[2:35:57] <+HyperCharge_Sam> the entire storyline ends there GG

[2:36:02] <oruandrew> F
[2:36:03] <SGrim> @KazMkII he hasn't even made the timeskip in a run yet. So, no one.
[2:36:03] <%Laecerelius> Pat loves killing off his children

[2:36:06] <phatballlz54> bites za dusto
[2:36:07] <+sunriser696> thats where my story ends

[2:36:08] <%InugamiTheHound> Big F for Pat
[2:36:09] <Doodle_Taco> @runningfleet No
[2:36:12] <+Grayhammatter> welp, this is going super badly
[2:36:20] <%TomDanksEGOT> REWIND
[2:36:20] <%aivalera> Pat, use the gambit!
[2:36:27] <+HyperCharge_Sam> move Ingrid in front of Dimitri
[2:36:28] <MSN04_Sazabi> "No, that's the limit, I'm triggering it, now!"
[2:36:29] <+peri_d0t> Gambit time
[2:36:33] <%GabeSweetMan> Most gambits disable units
[2:36:39] <KazMkII> @SGrim Wait what? I thought he started with GD? He quit?
[2:36:41] <Sir_Walrus> @kazmkii my GD playthrough was my first one, where I married doroth because I was a fool who went with my pre-game notions, if I could go back and change it it’d be Lysithea
[2:36:42] <%aivalera> Gambits do aoe damage and cannot be retaliated against
[2:36:45] <Roz_Lynd> time for gambit! bank those motes!!
[2:36:48] <Roz_Lynd> summon that primeval!
[2:36:52] <ShershaAD> @angriestpat i only ask, as someones whose very recently gotten into XV, ive heard so much praise for episode ignis, amd you seemed quite enthused with that game
[2:36:52] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> No way!
[2:36:53] <%GabeSweetMan> LUL
[2:36:54] <Roz_Lynd> oh wait. never mind
[2:36:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> get bushed
[2:36:57] <+Grayhammatter> goddammit dedue
[2:36:59] <%starotter70> LUL
[2:36:59] <Sir_Walrus> Wait
[2:37:02] <Doodle_Taco> Bruh moment
[2:37:03] <DSD24> RNGesus strikes again
[2:37:08] <+sunriser696> dedue just pulled an xcom
[2:37:08] <Sir_Walrus> FailFish
[2:37:10] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> "Tee Hee, MURDER =D"
[2:37:15] <%StaceMcGate> Cheer500 Authority increases the grade of what battalions you can equip. Better battalions = better stats. Gambits are great for crowd control and needed for fighting monsters as they draw aggro and destroy barriers quickly. Destroyed barriers give rare materials. Also make Dimitri a cavalier as he doesn't not get unique classes until post time-skip and Lord sucks.
[2:37:17] <%GabeSweetMan> RNGsus is not in your favor today
[2:37:17] <+vdalson> @Sir_Walrus he'll figure it out
[2:37:32] <+peri_d0t> Eddie still might die tho
[2:37:44] <+runningfleet> Dedead
[2:37:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> who da flip is eddie
[2:37:57] <KazMkII> @Sir_Walrus I married Lysethia and I was BL. It would have been Shamir if she had more personality
[2:37:59] <%MisterTylerrr> @DSD24 Why would they send children into battles without armor?
[2:38:10] <+peri_d0t> I meant dedue. that's my nickname for him
[2:38:15] <%MisterTylerrr> That seems irresponsible
[2:38:16] <Sir_Walrus> Cav has -10% speed growth, bad 4 dimeech
[2:38:20] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Crest Power!
[2:38:24] <%sourceofall> also anime
[2:38:26] <ovan20> LUL
[2:38:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @KazMkII Shamir would have worked better if Byleth wasn't a silent protagonist

[2:38:40] <%GabeSweetMan> FUCK
[2:38:40] <ShershaAD> @angriestpat any specific reason you didnt stream ep ignis? (sorry for tge repost)
[2:38:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> riPepperonis
[2:38:42] <DSD24> @MisterTylerrr Because they need experience before they can a promotion to get armor
[2:38:43] <+Grayhammatter> i mean, true, but aldo not?
[2:38:43] <+sunriser696> @Sphincter_Spelunker Edgelord guard

[2:38:52] <oruandrew> gdi dedue

[2:39:06] <Onjani> fake F
[2:39:07] <%MisterTylerrr> @DSD24 experienced in getting stabbed and cut with bladed weapons?
[2:39:08] <Sir_Walrus> Oh wait he’s on casual it doesn’t matter lol
[2:39:10] <knightmatty21> did you just kill dedue
[2:39:10] <ShershaAD> we need the tiling pat da. age
[2:39:10] <%wujak> guess its a good thing you are playing baby mode after all
[2:39:11] <%Meidolaon> Good thing you're playing Casual LUL
[2:39:12] <+peri_d0t> LOL
[2:39:21] <%Shadicara> Good thing he's on baby mode LUL
[2:39:22] <+peri_d0t> oh he's on casual
[2:39:24] <KazMkII> NOOOOO YOU GO BACK FOR MY BOI
[2:39:25] <DSD24> @MisterTylerrr Pretty much
[2:39:27] <Sir_Walrus> Babby mode pat
[2:39:27] <shielded_minitilt> omai wa
[2:39:32] <%GabeSweetMan> So basically the Ax is AWFUL when it comes to defense. You get 2x all time with one equipped.
[2:39:33] <ooblag> I didn't even know Dedue had a death quote, I just assumed they never bothered to record one, since getting him killed is basically impossible
[2:39:42] <%MisterTylerrr> @DSD24 That's some dumb anime bullshit
[2:39:42] <FoxInABeret> Does Pat know about danger area?
[2:39:43] <+theotherkristian> What about ZAWUREO
[2:39:44] <Doodle_Taco> INGRID IS SO HAPPY DEDUE DIED
[2:39:46] <+peri_d0t> nothing wrong with being on casual mode lat
[2:39:48] <+peri_d0t> pat
[2:39:56] <%starotter70> He is Lat now
[2:39:58] <%Meidolaon> INGRID HAPPINESS GO UP
[2:40:02] <ShershaAD> @angriestpat any reason you didn't stream it? (sorry for the 4th repost)
[2:40:03] <Sir_Walrus> @ooblag are you kidding me a mage can sneeze at him and he’ll die
[2:40:07] <+Grayhammatter> yes, yes you are
[2:40:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @ooblag his magic resist is pretty shite. I got him killed a lot. whoops
[2:40:13] <%Meidolaon> Still better than Woolie LUL
[2:40:20] <+peri_d0t> ^
[2:40:21] <+HyperCharge_Sam> use gambits Pat
[2:40:22] <%Shadicara> Seen worse pat Kappa
[2:40:23] <DSD24> @MisterTylerrr Its more of a progression thing so that once they get their promotions then they start getting different armor
[2:40:24] <RazHarvey> i hate it when devs all their mode casual LUL
[2:40:27] <%InugamiTheHound> you need better healers or heal earlier so folks won't die so often
[2:40:31] <+theotherkristian> ZR button is always there, just kinda chillin
[2:40:34] <ShershaAD> pat, bad at the vidja gaems....NAH
[2:40:39] <%king_wragles> So is Dedue like dead dead?
[2:40:43] <%Meidolaon> Nah
[2:40:45] <%Meidolaon> Casual
[2:40:46] <ooblag> I guess my Dedue was RNG blessed, he had like 24 Res
[2:40:46] <RazHarvey> call*
[2:40:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> casual mode, nah
[2:40:49] <+peri_d0t> no he's on casual mode
[2:40:51] <shozent> The AI is fucked in this map
[2:40:51] <kingkeldeo31> nah he'll be back
[2:40:54] <%GummiBunnies> he's taking a nap
[2:40:55] <DSD24> @king_wragles No he's all good
[2:40:56] <%GabeSweetMan> Dedue just had an ouchie.
[2:40:56] <shozent> They all run to the left
[2:40:57] <%king_wragles> so why Pat sad?
[2:41:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> this map sucks pre-mounts
[2:41:09] <%StaceMcGate> poor Dedue gets screwed over by the story
[2:41:11] <+Grayhammatter> dedue's just taking a nap
[2:41:15] <poweredscoot> dudue got big booboo
[2:41:19] <knightmatty21> lucky its not deduesday
[2:41:19] <ShershaAD> @king_wragles lack of pat damage
[2:41:20] <%starotter70> @king_wragles No level ups for him
[2:41:21] <+HyperCharge_Sam> gotta heal Felix
[2:41:29] <%MisterTylerrr> @DSD24 Even explained like that, it still sounds stupid. They should at least be wearing some kinda shitty armor so they get used to carrying the extra weight around...ALSO THEY'RE GETTING STABBED
[2:41:29] <Sir_Walrus> Pat’s sad that he’s bad at games @king_wragles
[2:41:31] <%king_wragles> @starotter70 oh shit
[2:41:35] <%Shadicara> dedue is just taking a doodoo
[2:41:36] <%Meidolaon> So was Lys legit recruited or is she a guest?
[2:41:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> guest
[2:41:42] <%StaceMcGate> Guest
[2:41:44] <%starotter70> @king_wragles Just for this battle
[2:41:45] <%Meidolaon> Shame
[2:41:48] <+peri_d0t> @mistertylerrr but like...magic man
[2:41:49] <+theotherkristian> Intelligent systems figured out the hard way, its SUPER hard to write a story in which so many PC's could just get decked in the ass
[2:41:54] <ShershaAD> also, WHEN BATRICK SKULLBOIVIN???
[2:41:56] <ooblag> NO
[2:41:58] <%snow_bush> More defense is good.
[2:41:59] <%Laecerelius> Lys is there to be Felix's healer
[2:42:00] <%StaceMcGate> Guests are useful for building support
[2:42:03] <ooblag> Pat plz
[2:42:06] <%EmiinV> rangel2Woah hello friends
[2:42:07] <DawnsRoyal> @MisterTylerrr they are obv wearing chainmail under their uniforms Kappa
[2:42:10] <+Grayhammatter> but soon she will be part of the team
[2:42:16] <%king_wragles> @starotter70 No I get that, but in FE missing out on a level of two can be big... at least from what I remember of he old ones lol
[2:42:24] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:42:27] <%StaceMcGate> and dead
[2:42:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh

[2:42:34] <RazHarvey> HALP
[2:42:35] <%MisterTylerrr> @DawnsRoyal I've been hoping someone would at least suggest that earlier
[2:42:35] <%juxtest> Oops
[2:42:36] <Graywolf_the_45th> good job
[2:42:37] <%Laecerelius> Pat is very bad at not having people die
[2:42:38] <+peri_d0t> Lysithea is a monster
[2:42:38] <Sir_Walrus> @king_wragles it’s not too big a deal in this one
[2:42:39] <%Shadicara> Why didn't pat put her near his character so he could b rank her faster Kappa
[2:42:41] <MSN04_Sazabi> Lys: "Fuck this shit I'm out"

[2:42:47] <ShershaAD> @angriestpat oh pat did you hear about eyepatch wolfs upcoming silent hill 2 stream?
[2:42:47] <%snow_bush> Pat...
[2:42:48] <Sir_Walrus> Pat please
[2:42:49] <%juxtest> How many times can he do that?
[2:42:51] <+HyperCharge_Sam> gotta look at the redlines after you move
[2:42:52] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Real Man's World!
[2:42:55] <KazMkII> Got Dedue and Lysethia killed. LITERALLY HOW
[2:42:59] <kingkeldeo31> consume the dirt
[2:43:00] <+peri_d0t> @juxtest 2 more times
[2:43:01] <+runningfleet> @king_wragles not really your bases tend to matter more
[2:43:06] <%snow_bush> Moving Wall
[2:43:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @KazMkII Dimitri too
[2:43:08] <Quietshun13> pat you bad
[2:43:09] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Why aren't you using ZR for danger zones?
[2:43:09] <+theotherkristian> I love using that up to 13 TIMES by the end
[2:43:10] <DSD24> @juxtest He only has a few charges
[2:43:12] <ooblag> Pat, use choke points. A mage should NEVER get attacked by enemy melee units
[2:43:13] <%Nobrev> look at enemy threat zones more pat
[2:43:14] <%snow_bush> Just turtle up
[2:43:17] <%miguelrod777> bite za dusto
[2:43:17] <%starotter70> @king_wragles It isn't TOO big a deal here, especially considering that, since Pat's on easy mode, he can fight as many battles as he wants
[2:43:31] <%MisterTylerrr> You gon get flanked
[2:43:38] <+runningfleet> even in the old games the prepromotes were enough to win
[2:43:48] <Sir_Walrus> @angriestpat pat press ZR please
[2:44:05] <%GabeSweetMan> STR doh
[2:44:05] <luckyifpurple> damn the crits are coming in today
[2:44:12] <+Grayhammatter> threat zone
[2:44:15] <%GabeSweetMan> DAMN
[2:44:15] <Quietshun13> because it helps your units not die pat
[2:44:16] <+Grayhammatter> WHAT
[2:44:18] <%starotter70> 1% Nice
[2:44:21] <%Josef_Stryker> YEYEYEYE
[2:44:21] <phatballlz54> crit city
[2:44:24] <%StaceMcGate> 1% Crit, Ashe you mad lad
[2:44:24] <%juxtest> 360 noscope
[2:44:24] <DSD24> Crit bois!
[2:44:25] <Onjani> nice
[2:44:27] <+peri_d0t> frig city
[2:44:27] <kingkeldeo31> 1% ?
[2:44:28] <%Ferakin> Ashe is a One Percenter, definitely
[2:44:32] <%snow_bush> Right in the dick
[2:44:35] <%Shadicara> dad slayer
[2:44:40] <+HyperCharge_Sam> they can change targets after you move
[2:44:44] <+Risingxiv> Pat knows he can rewind right?
[2:44:49] <+peri_d0t> yes
[2:44:50] <DSD24> @Risingxiv Yes he does
[2:44:51] <ooblag> You keep letting them attack your back line though
[2:44:52] <kingkeldeo31> it changes on the fly
[2:44:53] <%Meidolaon> He's been rewinding
[2:44:54] <%Nobrev> so you can position them where they wont get attacked beforehand
[2:44:57] <Sir_Walrus> Okay guess pat just won’t use the good range feature
[2:44:59] <%Meidolaon> He doesn't care because Casual
[2:45:00] <+Grayhammatter> he has rewinded multiple times
[2:45:04] <jkfd> i guess the appeal of zr becomes clearer on classic mode and maybe not normal
[2:45:06] <KazMkII> @AngriestPat I dare you to play the game in Zoom in view
[2:45:17] <+peri_d0t> dear God no
[2:45:20] <%StaceMcGate> not using rally is spiking up my mind goblins
[2:45:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no, zoom in more, they mean
[2:45:33] <jkfd> oh is anyone playing the game in zoomed in view? :)
[2:45:34] <Sir_Walrus> Zoom in view is actually really cool, it’s just a bit disorienting
[2:45:35] <KazMkII> no, Zoom in
[2:45:39] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat zoom more
[2:45:45] <Quietshun13> press plus
[2:45:48] <jkfd> i switch into it from time to time just for some additional atmosphere
[2:45:48] <+peri_d0t> zoom mode is annoying
[2:45:50] <Sir_Walrus> @angriestpat press +
[2:45:55] <%solidousstream> ENHANCE
[2:45:58] <%king_wragles> we wanna see all the pixels
[2:46:05] <ooblag> Pat, you can SEE Lysithea getting targeted. You want to move melee units to block such things
[2:46:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> nothing huh
[2:46:17] <%StaceMcGate> this mode is unplayable
[2:46:25] <%BioApple> take a turn in big zoom mode
[2:46:30] <DSD24> That mode is to look cool
[2:46:31] <Quietshun13> thats the zoom in mode
[2:46:31] <Sir_Walrus> You can play like that
[2:46:39] <Sir_Walrus> It looks cool
[2:46:41] <KazMkII> nevermind pat
[2:46:45] <%Meidolaon> He's stopped reading
[2:46:47] <%StaceMcGate> you still have another battle
[2:46:52] <jkfd> pat, you can move around your units like in the monastery in zoomed in mode
[2:46:52] <+peri_d0t> that mode is for cool screenshots
[2:46:56] <%bread_assassin> Pat was so adamant about min-maxing his stats, but is lackadaisical about actually playing the game.
[2:47:11] <DSD24> Its a huge joke Ashe
[2:47:12] <Sir_Walrus> He’s not even min maxing well lol
[2:47:15] <%InugamiTheHound> even the game knew that was bullshit
[2:47:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "what does rally do? I never used battalions"
[2:47:27] <%BioApple> I feel like pat has to play this casually or the random stat increases would kill him
[2:47:30] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat that's an archer man
[2:47:42] <ooblag> NoWhy did you put Felix there?

[2:48:02] <+Grayhammatter> uh... what
[2:48:02] <KazMkII> FailFish
[2:48:04] <DSD24> BTW Pat if you press A on a specific enemy you can only see that enemies range
[2:48:04] <+peri_d0t> pat wat
[2:48:08] <Doodle_Taco> ?????????
[2:48:14] <%king_wragles> apatWhat
[2:48:15] <%snow_bush> Oh god, its triggering me
[2:48:18] <kingkeldeo31> Curazi Talku
[2:48:27] <%Meidolaon> Pat go sleep you're not even thinking anymore
[2:48:27] <DSD24> Pressing X makes you see every enemies range
[2:48:31] <Sir_Walrus> That’s ok because she lives
[2:48:39] <ooblag> I think Pat fell asleep, and is sleep playing
[2:48:45] <RazHarvey> remember guys, pat is drunk and tired
[2:48:47] <%StaceMcGate> Has Pat used Gambits yet?
[2:48:48] <RazHarvey> and crazy
[2:48:57] <KazMkII> So who's better at FE, Woolie or Pat?
[2:49:00] <+peri_d0t> pat are you okay?
[2:49:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat
[2:49:01] <Graywolf_the_45th> No, he's just high from smoking so much weed
[2:49:02] <+djinnJuice> I'm not even a fire emblem elitist but pat is just either at Sweden-level streamer tax or his brain is leaking out his ears or something
[2:49:16] <%Meidolaon> Forgot to Gambit?
[2:49:21] <XyraFhoan> there aren't gambits to use at this level
[2:49:24] <ooblag> Wat
[2:49:24] <%Meidolaon> Or Combat Art rather
[2:49:37] <+djinnJuice> why is he using rally
[2:49:39] <+djinnJuice> instead of attacking
[2:49:46] <kingbaconcrispy> @djinnJuice You mean pewdiepie
[2:49:46] <%StaceMcGate> there are gambits to use, they do more damage than attacking based on their CHA
[2:49:48] <%snow_bush> I think he's trying to get XP for specific folks
[2:49:50] <+InEzrealwetrust> new game + with blue lions?
[2:49:55] <Onmi_Khaos> No
[2:49:58] <Onmi_Khaos> Just New Game

[2:50:13] <%snow_bush> Gambit
[2:50:17] <%Shadicara> LUL
[2:50:25] <RogerPoore> is he grinding on a free mission
[2:50:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no gambits to use eh
[2:50:35] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat They are summons
[2:50:41] <%miguelrod777> the enmey cant hit back
[2:50:42] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat group attacks
[2:50:44] <DSD24> I can explain if you would like
[2:50:45] <+djinnJuice> yeah bro I'm boutta head out
[2:50:46] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> wait till monsters.
[2:50:48] <+djinnJuice> this is too painful
[2:50:49] <+D00msDayDan> bank those motes brotha
[2:50:49] <%InugamiTheHound> its a free attack
[2:50:49] <ooblag> They stun an enemy and can't be countered. Plus they're AoE
[2:50:50] <betrayed_llama> Enemies cant counter attack a gambit
[2:50:54] <+thackattack00> The enemy can't move after getting hit by them
[2:50:56] <Quietshun13> the stop the enemy from moving, give you stat bonuses and displace them
[2:51:00] <%aivalera> Pat, trust me when I say to use your battlaions, it will come back to help you later
[2:51:02] <Onmi_Khaos> Why not HEAL FELIX?!
[2:51:05] <XyraFhoan> oh, I thought he was earlier, the gambit npc doesn't show up for a few chapters
[2:51:05] <%sourceofall> i mostly use the support ones, like the aoe +5 movement!!! one
[2:51:13] <%Basch71> chats fucking triggered LuL
[2:51:14] <%BioApple> Stride is hilarious
[2:51:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> backseats back, alright
[2:51:23] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> if you want certain ores and stuff, you'll need to use gambits on those monsters.
[2:51:24] <Sir_Walrus> @angriestpat they’re AoE attacks for big groups of enemies
[2:51:26] <kingkeldeo31> don't worry you'll get them once the enemies start using em
[2:51:28] <%VioletHeart> It's super not weird. You equip one, it gives you stat boosts, and gives you some per-fight limited uses of special skills.
[2:51:28] <%starotter70> Was this not what people were expecting?
[2:51:29] <HenCereal> rbzShitseatgaming
[2:51:30] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Gambits are one - two use summons per combat
[2:51:31] <Admiral_PopnFresh> is this guy impervious or something?
[2:51:33] <%Meidolaon> He's trying to get-
[2:51:38] <%snow_bush> Oh god, he's running her over to get XP
[2:51:39] <%Meidolaon> He... Forgot to attack
[2:51:40] <FoxInABeret> GAMBIT BENEFITS: No counters. Status effects on enemy (no move, debuff, etc.). Force enemy to move (further away, closer, swap spaces, etc.). Make monsters big sad.
[2:51:40] <Onmi_Khaos> @AngriestPat Gambits are like equipment, they say what they do in their item descriptions
[2:51:46] <Doodle_Taco> Watch as Ingrid just increases one stat
[2:51:46] <Jibbleheimer> Didn't pick Black Eagles? That's a shame.
[2:51:49] <+peri_d0t> pat your turn count!!!
[2:52:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ya did it, blonde cardboard
[2:52:00] <%juxtest> Her lick has gone up
[2:52:11] <%Meidolaon> Turn count doesn't matter in 3H?
[2:52:13] <jkfd> pat: gambits will start to make more and more sense as you progress in the game. when a map is littered with monsters, for example, and you want to collect as much of the rare ores as possible. or when there's a unit on the map that needs to be softened up until one of your units can 1hit kill it because it one shots anyone you put up against it.
[2:52:15] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> doesn't matter right now.
[2:52:18] <%StaceMcGate> Most maps have 25 turn limits, but not free maps
[2:52:19] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat They're mostly just useful as Stat buffs until your Authority is high enough to really do damage with their abilities. That or just crowd control. They can put enemy units in a state where they can't travel on their turns.
[2:52:20] <%Meidolaon> This isn't PoR or RD
[2:52:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> game over at 100 turns
[2:52:22] <+peri_d0t> it doesn't matter
[2:52:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> or failed rather
[2:52:26] <jorniev> pat who should be in smash tracer, kerrigan, or green jesus?
[2:52:28] <Ubu2933> Ahh the age old tradition of the group stomp level grind
[2:52:30] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> not for this mission
[2:52:31] <%solidousstream> ok well July phones gonna die so good luck @angriestpat and goodnight everybody!
[2:52:33] <+runningfleet> turn count almost never matters in fe
[2:52:39] <Sir_Walrus> It doesn’t
[2:52:51] <worldbrand> I run battles to 99 to max out supports all the time who cares
[2:52:59] <+peri_d0t> I was joking pat
[2:52:59] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> some missions have a turn count limit. Fail to win under that limit, you fail. Don't worry about it.
[2:53:01] <Graywolf_the_45th> 14 is pretty close to 100
[2:53:07] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Pat is grinding his pokemon, huh?
[2:53:07] <oruandrew> dps race lul
[2:53:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Graywolf_the_45th LUL
[2:53:23] <Sir_Walrus> I mean turn count matters of you want to be proud of it....which I do
[2:53:33] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat it's not, most are just attacks while very few are support
[2:53:36] <%VioletHeart> Or you could just read what it says the gambit does.
[2:53:36] <+thackattack00> just memorize it
[2:53:36] <+runningfleet> you just get used to ir
[2:53:37] <Onmi_Khaos> It's like an extra weapon man
[2:53:39] <Onmi_Khaos> It's not that hard
[2:53:41] <KazMkII> is it though?
[2:53:42] <knightmatty21> thank god its over
[2:53:43] <%Meidolaon> Gambits are tied to Battallions
[2:53:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you can check with x, then cycle twice
[2:53:44] <Quietshun13> its no that bad
[2:53:45] <+thackattack00> theres like 10 types
[2:53:45] <poweredscoot> We did it, and mostly in one piece
[2:53:47] <BaronVonDickButt> YOU WIN
[2:53:47] <worldbrand> Later on you'll have a handful that you like
[2:53:49] <DSD24> MVP Annette baby
[2:53:50] <%EmiinV> we did it
[2:53:51] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Just think of gambits like summons from FF7
[2:53:53] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat there are only so many gambits
[2:53:57] <+peri_d0t> you did it pat
[2:53:59] <worldbrand> The one that makes everyone move farther is pretty nice
[2:54:00] <KazMkII> F for dedue
[2:54:07] <KazMkII> I no he's alive
[2:54:11] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> gotta do it Patto
[2:54:15] <%starotter70> You can't do one and back out
[2:54:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you can't
[2:54:20] <%aivalera> B
[2:54:23] <ooblag> You can't
[2:54:23] <%StaceMcGate> you can't do certifications till next week
[2:54:27] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> otherwise you're wasting those points
[2:54:31] <%sl8r4l8r> CAN'T FIND THE EXIT GOTTA FIND THE EXIT
[2:54:32] <RazHarvey> never back down can't back down
[2:54:44] <%floralkami> floralkami subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! man, how many times am I gonna have to type out a message? what keeps happening to my messages FeelsBadMan
[2:54:48] <%starotter70> Not until later
[2:54:50] <ooblag> Do it next week
[2:54:51] <%Kuro_Koshka> Pat have you tried using Training weapons so your speed isn't shit and you stop getting double attacked?
[2:54:51] <Doodle_Taco> You cant
[2:54:54] <%miguelrod777> nope have to finsh
[2:54:54] <shozent> Start a new map pat
[2:54:55] <%floralkami> OH, NOW IT FUCKING WORKS
[2:54:55] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat No
[2:54:59] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> you can reclass here, but you can't certify
[2:54:59] <worldbrand> Huh?
[2:54:59] <oruandrew> nah its fine
[2:55:00] <papershuriken_0> its not that bad
[2:55:00] <%Kuro_Koshka> You can only do certifications at the start of the week
[2:55:00] <betrayed_llama> Cant if youre in the mission log
[2:55:01] <%VioletHeart> What
[2:55:02] <%aivalera> LUL what you think you can break the game THAT much
[2:55:03] <%starotter70> It's not that bad
[2:55:04] <+runningfleet> you are already pretty overleved
[2:55:07] <oruandrew> its totally fine
[2:55:08] <%starotter70> apatGoblin
[2:55:13] <ooblag> On average, it will be exactly 1 stat point. Across thew entire team
[2:55:13] <+jacintafor> youll be fine
[2:55:13] <+peri_d0t> you have to go back to the school. you'll be fine pat
[2:55:14] <%StaceMcGate> It's fine Pat, just level up
[2:55:14] <shozent> I think you can when you start a new map?
[2:55:16] <papershuriken_0> pretty much
[2:55:16] <Doodle_Taco> Pat its fine
[2:55:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> one level ain't gonna kill you
[2:55:19] <worldbrand> Let's face it, you're not going to hit cap anyway
[2:55:21] <Roz_Lynd> part of me feels like min-maxing in a fire emblem game is an exercise in madness cuz it's a game that lives and dies on the random number generator
[2:55:23] <Quietshun13> pat, remember you're on normal, its not that bad
[2:55:24] <+GimmMeUhSammich> When min/maxing goes wrong
[2:55:26] <RazHarvey> games easy anyways
[2:55:26] <DawnsRoyal> next class only adds like extra 10% chance in only 1 stat
[2:55:34] <+jacintafor> you don't need to min max in this game pat]
[2:55:35] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> just pick one, get some gold.
[2:55:35] <%Ferakin> @AngriestPat The Beginner classes have shit-all for stat procs, don't worry about them too much
[2:55:36] <%VioletHeart> You're overleveled for main story quests.
[2:55:37] <%MisterTylerrr> There's no such thing as Overleveled
[2:55:39] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> it's all good
[2:55:40] <poweredscoot> Overleveled means jitting the cap
[2:55:40] <%StaceMcGate> don't complain about min-maxing on baby difficulty
[2:55:40] <%MisterTylerrr> I hate that term
[2:55:45] <%Ferakin> Intermediate is when it really starts to matter
[2:55:45] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat beginner classes don;t improve it that much
[2:55:56] <Sir_Walrus> @angriestpat this is babby difficultly who cares
[2:56:04] <%Ferakin> Monk doesn't even have a percentage to level up Magic
[2:56:07] <%floralkami> @angriestpat twitch ate my last two messages and spit out the shitty third attempt cause OF COURSE
[2:56:22] <+peri_d0t> pat what do you think of this games music so far
[2:56:27] <hlreiku> This song sounds like that coldplay song
[2:56:33] <hlreiku> When I ruled the wooorld
[2:56:34] <%sporeian94> Recruit Dorothea she's got two AMAZING assests
[2:56:48] <%MisterTylerrr> That's not true. You can do a level exploit in Dragon Age 2 and then your gear ends up too weak for even basic fights
[2:56:48] <%starotter70> Kappa
[2:56:51] <%Punchasaur> Please
[2:56:53] <%StaceMcGate> Fodlan Winds Kreygasm
[2:56:55] <goddamndavid> wait, Nioh triggers the mind goblins but not this game??
[2:56:57] <oruandrew> turtle up!
[2:57:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Question. What should I do with Pegasus Knights past 20? Advanced Classes don't seem good to switch to
[2:57:10] <%starotter70> @goddamndavid What do you mean "not this game"!?
[2:57:11] <+peri_d0t> TURTLE POWER
[2:57:22] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Practice with gambits, their accuracy increases with more allies adjacent
[2:57:22] <hlreiku> Attack that man in a suit
[2:57:29] <%MisterTylerrr> @goddamndavid Stop acting like Pat's psychoses can be explained
[2:57:31] <+peri_d0t> @sphincter_spelunker keep em a Pegasus knight or go assassin imo
[2:57:35] <+InEzrealwetrust> demitri is a fuckin beast of a lord
[2:57:36] <%Ferakin> Advanced doesn't have anything good for fliers, really
[2:57:41] <Roz_Lynd> man there is so much nuance to this game...
[2:57:43] <Sir_Walrus> Fodlan winds is sick, unfortunately he won’t be streaming to get to chasing daybreak
[2:57:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> got it, thanks
[2:57:49] <goddamndavid> @MisterTylerrr good point!
[2:57:52] <%Ferakin> Switch them to Assassin for that glorious Speed and wait for Master classes
[2:57:53] <%floralkami> @angriestpat how you enjoying today? I hope our million demands for streams don't have you under pressure.
[2:57:57] <Roz_Lynd> i'm so used to the gba games where it was literally just weapon triangle
[2:58:08] <+jacintafor> rip
[2:58:22] <%StaceMcGate> You can probably go the entire game with Training weapons on normal
[2:58:40] <+peri_d0t> training weapons are optimal most times
[2:58:45] <+jacintafor> @AngriestPat pat did you notice that felix is a mini vergil
[2:58:57] <Quietshun13> my sylvain just needed a training axe on hard
[2:58:59] <%starotter70> @jacintafor Oh yes
[2:59:08] <%Kuro_Koshka> use the bushes/terrain Pat :v
[2:59:12] <%starotter70> Bless you
[2:59:13] <%CopperTucker> @jacintafor oh thank god it's not just me who noticed
[2:59:15] <+InEzrealwetrust> Reeeee use the grass
[2:59:16] <%Kuro_Koshka> missing free defense and dodge
[2:59:20] <DSD24> "This is what peak performace looks like"
[2:59:20] <Doodle_Taco> Bless you
[2:59:23] <+jacintafor> he even has proficiency in fist
[2:59:24] <+peri_d0t> all you really NEED is training and iron weapons
[2:59:35] <%Ferakin> @AngriestPat By the way, Training/Iron weapons can be better than Steel and above, since people will attack twice with them earlier and much more often
[2:59:37] <%Punchasaur> The game is pretty easy even without optimizing
[2:59:39] <%Kuro_Koshka> Yeah training weapons are hilariously ovepowered
[2:59:39] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat remember the grass squares up the evasion of whatever unit is standing on them
[2:59:44] <Sir_Walrus> @angriestpat I suddenly feel bad for backseating so much, sorry about that...but you are very bad at this game
[2:59:48] <%Kuro_Koshka> Speed is the best stat unless you are really screwed on str/mag
[2:59:53] <%WackyGear> they're super useful
[3:00:00] <%Punchasaur> Just have fun and don’t worry about backseaters
[3:00:07] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> NICE!

[3:01:26] <%floralkami> nooooooo, what was said? I wanna knoooooo
[3:01:29] <%AncelDeLambert> it's a church, what do you expect
[3:01:29] <xtremegamer80> Like that must've fucking hurt to get hit with an arrow, fully pulled back, and shot into his chest
[3:01:31] <%RubberFistFight> @Anonymasque lately they've been doing it every stream.
[3:01:31] <%Basch71> everyone knows chat is god tier gamers who never make mistakes LuL
[3:01:34] <+InEzrealwetrust> Duscur face powers Ingrid
[3:01:37] <Roz_Lynd> this is a fire emblem game
[3:01:37] <%StaceMcGate> Pat is good at games, but he doesn't want to go out of his comfort zone. He will never use gambits because he is afraid to experiment
[3:01:38] <+vdalson> @floralkami i guess you'll never know
[3:01:40] <Admiral_PopnFresh> if Felix is Vergil, then who is Dymitri? Ky Kiske? or maybe...Jin Kisaragi?
[3:01:44] <Roz_Lynd> everyone is evil but the player-character
[3:01:45] <%AncelDeLambert> It's a giant political body with its own standing army, of course it's evil
[3:01:46] <%EmiinV> 'twas a question, not a statementt
[3:01:48] <KazMkII> Church did NOTHING wrong
[3:01:49] <%Punchasaur> DUSK FACE
[3:01:49] <%EmiinV> i'm here for hoes bein mad
[3:01:51] <lokiluko> "show the children what happens to people who fuck with me" Rhea
[3:01:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Admiral_PopnFresh Someone said Batman
[3:01:54] <%BioApple> who cares for optimal play. it's normal, just let him slam into the enemy headfirst so we can hit the good stuff sooner
[3:01:57] <Onmi_Khaos> We can't talk about whom Dimitri is
[3:01:59] <+jacintafor> Dimitri is snake
[3:02:00] <GPAlpha> Just make everyone Vergil
[3:02:02] <%RubberFistFight> @StaceMcGate welcome to the human race though.,
[3:02:04] <Onmi_Khaos> Without giving up major plot spoilers
[3:02:05] <+InEzrealwetrust> WE NEED TO PUSH DUSK FACE FOR SUMMER SLAM
[3:02:05] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @floralkami Basicaly "I feel bad about backseating. Pat's bad at game, blah blah."
[3:02:11] <%Ferakin> Also remember, people adjacent to Byleth get increased experience gain
[3:02:14] <damienlunas> I don't like the system sound effects in this. It's so jarring to hear this modern-sounding music and then have it use the GBA blip bloops for leveling up
[3:02:28] <%floralkami> @zaphire_saucypants oh, that's not a funny version..
[3:02:37] <GiygasDrillBreak> battle music so happy
[3:02:41] <+peri_d0t> @damienlunas I didn't mind. it's pretty much tradition at this point
[3:02:44] <+thackattack00> The GBA blip bloops are classic tho
[3:02:47] <Doodle_Taco> @damienlunas There is literally a dubstep stage later in GD
[3:02:48] <%StaceMcGate> @RubberFistFight Yeah, the issue is that Gambits are integral. It's like refusing to parry in Sekiro or using Sync attacks in Astral Chain
[3:02:49] <%Punchasaur> @floralkami scroll up then
[3:02:53] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami it was basically a shitty gamer take.
[3:02:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> yeah, that's the song
[3:02:59] <%EmiinV> well he died p early last fight so
[3:02:59] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @floralkami wasn't trying to funny. Too tired for funny.
[3:03:01] <%Laecerelius> I mean you did get him killed last battle
[3:03:05] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @Sphincter_Spelunker @jacintafor An over serious crusader with parental issues? LUL
[3:03:11] <BaronVonDickButt> #GoldenDeer4Life #WoolieIsNeverWrong
[3:03:12] <worldbrand> have you seen cursed geodudue
[3:03:18] <%Kuro_Koshka> Rally only works on the turn its used Pat
[3:03:19] <%RubberFistFight> @StaceMcGate they can't be that integral if the game doesn't break if you don't use them.
[3:03:20] <DSD24> Claude is best lord
[3:03:23] <%Alaster101> #deerSquad
[3:03:24] <+Anonymasque> @RubberFistFight I haven't been watching too many streams lately but I guess these waves of assholish behavior flare up now and then.
[3:03:24] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Pat you need to replenish your Gambits each battle at the marketplace. Their endurance is nearly gone
[3:03:24] <xtremegamer80> @worldbrand Come again?
[3:03:27] <%Kuro_Koshka> If Dedue isnt attacked its totally wasted
[3:03:30] <Onmi_Khaos> #WooliesPrettyConsistentlyWrong
[3:03:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> rally is fine for building the hearts
[3:03:43] <Doodle_Taco> Golden Deer is the house of the memes and we know it
[3:03:44] <%sjay449> CRUSH THEIR WICKED SKULLS PAT!
[3:03:46] <+peri_d0t> geodedue
[3:03:47] <FoxInABeret> Rally is free support points if a unit can't do anything else.
[3:03:48] <+vdalson> @Kuro_Koshka but rally is free support points though
[3:03:52] <%yeknomlive> did pat beat be?
[3:03:53] <worldbrand> oh man i can't find it hang on it was on the subreddit at some point
[3:04:02] <%StaceMcGate> @RubberFistFight Integral for the bosses later. I haven't played normal, but its impossible to kill some without Gambits
[3:04:02] <GiygasDrillBreak> Rally is just FREE REAL ESTATE
[3:04:03] <%QueequegTheater> Dedue is a good boy
[3:04:05] <+thackattack00> no he got to chapter 8 in BE
[3:04:07] <+InEzrealwetrust> oh man I FORGOT THEY ALREADY CHANGED HIS VOICE
[3:04:13] <%RubberFistFight> @Anonymasque nah they're near-constant. I show up to a lot of Pat streams and every time I contemplate switching chat off because of how bad it gets.
[3:04:15] <+peri_d0t> I will rip her heart from your chest- rhea
[3:04:16] <Onmi_Khaos> Dedue knows what he's about
[3:04:17] <%QueequegTheater> You keep her alive
[3:04:24] <xtremegamer80> FEEL THE STORM
[3:04:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> why'd they even change the voice
[3:04:31] <%yeknomlive> ara ara
[3:04:32] <%sjay449> I played Bylass because I didn't want to play as Niosi
[3:04:36] <+Tyonidus> Master works all? You can't go wrong?
[3:04:44] <DSD24> @sjay449 He doesn't voice male Byleth now
[3:04:44] <xtremegamer80> @Sphincter_Spelunker Ahhh bunch of law stuff but also broke an NDA
[3:04:51] <+peri_d0t> @sphincter_spelunker va is controversial
[3:04:55] <%Ferakin> Demonic Beasts hunt in packs, Professor
[3:04:55] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Is Mercedes the mostly absurdly, aggressively "sweetie" type character ever
[3:04:56] <%Laecerelius> Oh man Ingrid is gonna be getting attacked a lot next turn
[3:04:57] <+InEzrealwetrust> something about abuse and broken NDA
[3:05:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oof
[3:05:07] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Dat soundtrack
[3:05:11] <%StaceMcGate> DP on Ingrid
[3:05:16] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @QueequegTheater oh boy is she.
[3:05:17] <artificiallynatural> Who does Byleth’s voice now?
[3:05:19] <DSD24> The new Male Byleth voice actor is good though
[3:05:29] <%Ferakin> Fun fact, new Byleth VA is Koichi
[3:05:32] <ShershaAD> @angriestpat any reason you didn't stream it? (sorry for the 5th repost)
[3:05:32] <+jacintafor> you know mercedez had to do it to em
[3:05:32] <RazHarvey> its like my fav hentai animes PogChamp
[3:05:35] <%QueequegTheater> @Zaphire_Saucypants I'm not complaining, I like her. But it's funny.
[3:05:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @QueequegTheater she's the ara ara
[3:05:48] <ShershaAD> @ferakin HIROSE?
[3:05:56] <%Punchasaur> @rubberfistfight huh. Every time you show up, chat seems to get bad. How strange :kappa
[3:06:03] <%QueequegTheater> No lewding the nun please, I was raised Catholic
[3:06:05] <%Ferakin> The shrieking sperg himself
[3:06:07] <xtremegamer80> Who do you think is more "ara ara": Manuela, Mercedes, or Rhea?
[3:06:09] <%starotter70> @artificiallynatural Zach Aguilar I think
[3:06:09] <+InEzrealwetrust> he dudue it
[3:06:10] <%SolverCODO> doodoo
[3:06:12] <Doodle_Taco> LUL
[3:06:12] <%GabeSweetMan> NO THAT'S GOOD
[3:06:13] <RazHarvey> dang
[3:06:16] <%QueequegTheater> D E D U E
[3:06:16] <%Laecerelius> Good enough
[3:06:18] <oruandrew> shameful display

[3:06:20] <+InEzrealwetrust> HE GOT THE GOOD STATS THO
[3:06:21] <%Saltmeisterr> DOODOO ROLLS
[3:06:22] <%StaceMcGate> Dedue is only giving 15% effort
[3:06:23] <xtremegamer80> @QueequegTheater Same but it's too late for daddy-p
[3:06:23] <+peri_d0t> perfect
[3:06:23] <+Ell1ot> everyone sounds pretty happy about murder
[3:06:23] <poweredscoot> All you need is Str
[3:06:24] <%Wallabri> you know he had to dedue it to them
[3:06:25] <ShershaAD> @xtremegamer80 holly kujo Kappa
[3:06:25] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @QueequegTheater ehh...never been a fan of the ara-ara characters. But that's just personal.
[3:06:25] <+jacintafor> mercedes and cyril's support is super ara ara energy
[3:06:26] <GPAlpha> WE DEDUE IT
[3:06:27] <xtremegamer80> *daddy-o
[3:06:27] <jsavarin> he got the two stats for him
[3:06:29] <%supersugoisenpai1> Those are the stats that matter for him
[3:06:29] <markdreizehn> Pat but not everybody can be Felix
[3:06:30] <Quietshun13> hey those are good stats
[3:06:32] <%RubberFistFight> @Punchasaur nice strawman there.
[3:06:32] <RazHarvey> stealing all the kills
[3:06:33] <pillowwasp> My boy Dimitri
[3:06:36] <DSD24> @artificiallynatural His name is Zach Aguilar
[3:06:38] <Onmi_Khaos> Pat, those are the stats he wants
[3:06:38] <shozent> Dedue got his most important stats tho
[3:06:38] <jsavarin> attack and defense is all he needs
[3:06:39] <+peri_d0t> all he needs is strength defense
[3:06:40] <xtremegamer80> @ShershaAD ...Good answer
[3:06:50] <%starotter70> Nice
[3:06:52] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Which routes have you completed
[3:06:57] <+peri_d0t> none
[3:06:58] <%Puhff> Puhff subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Holy shit 7 months! Thanks for the laughs and showing me Control, possibly my GOTY! Please give Elmo many belly rubs for me, tyvm <3
[3:06:58] <+Zhwoobatte> he stole dedue's stats
[3:07:00] <+InEzrealwetrust> damn thats a good one too
[3:07:06] <GiygasDrillBreak> Bylad really does rock the FEMTO cosplay
[3:07:11] <%Saltmeisterr> so does byleth have anime powers or is he a normie?
[3:07:15] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> so no spoilers
[3:07:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Can I make Byleth not a Sword person? Ya know cuz of plot
[3:07:23] <ShershaAD> @xtremegamer80 i aim to please, unlike kakyoin despite his best attempts
[3:07:23] <artificiallynatural> Dropped BE at chapter 8
[3:07:28] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Pat your battalions are near death, replenish their endurance at the marketplace
[3:07:30] <+jacintafor> @Saltmeisterr they all have anime powers
[3:07:30] <%Laecerelius> Byleth has time rewind powers
[3:07:30] <+peri_d0t> @saltmeisterr play the game
[3:07:36] <+InEzrealwetrust> right now i'd say about half and half @Saltmeisterr
[3:07:38] <%starotter70> @Saltmeisterr He can turn back time
[3:07:39] <%BioApple> @Saltmeisterr he's got a mind goblin that lets him rewind
[3:07:40] <jaknal> Hey Pat did you ever play Vandal Hearts for the ps1 or Dark Wizard for the Sega?
[3:07:44] <Doodle_Taco> LUL
[3:07:47] <%Saltmeisterr> ok
[3:07:49] <GiygasDrillBreak> Byleth = Ringo Roadagain
[3:07:49] <pillowwasp> BL is my favorite route
[3:07:52] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Then you should be aware that you get massive bonuses (and get to keep your professor rank) in NG+
[3:08:02] <Onmi_Khaos> BL best house
[3:08:08] <+peri_d0t> lies
[3:08:10] <+InEzrealwetrust> GD best house
[3:08:12] <Sir_Walrus> @sphincter_spelunker yeah you can make Byleth anything, so you know, make em a wyvern lord because it’s the best class in the game lol
[3:08:13] <+InEzrealwetrust> fight me onmi
[3:08:14] <xtremegamer80> So who're we gonna shout at Pat to pick for the secret class?
[3:08:15] <ShershaAD> @angriestpat any particular reason you didnt stream ignis?
[3:08:16] <%StaceMcGate> RNG is a cruel mistress
[3:08:17] <%Keyd00d> I will use Pat as my surrogate BL playthrough
[3:08:17] <%QueequegTheater> They're all good houses
[3:08:20] <lokiluko> beat vandal heart a few times as a wee lad, kindled my love of the genre
[3:08:20] <+jacintafor> @AngriestPat do you plan on making felix going full vergil with swords and fist
[3:08:21] <hntronium> boys love is indeed best house
[3:08:21] <markdreizehn> I'd turn wheel for that level up
[3:08:21] <+peri_d0t> #fearthedear
[3:08:21] <Doodle_Taco> GD We do it
[3:08:23] <%Takreth> You can buy back the professor rank, you don't "technically" keep it
[3:08:23] <xtremegamer80> I vote for Dimitri
[3:08:27] <%StaceMcGate> @QueequegTheater not Church
[3:08:30] <+InEzrealwetrust> #deerabby
[3:08:30] <poweredscoot> RNG giveth and RNG taketh away
[3:08:30] <Valdorick> Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
[3:08:33] <Roz_Lynd> "my house is the best pancake!"
[3:08:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Sir_Walrus Oooh. I know what my Bylass is gonna be
[3:08:39] <Ubu2933> god that trumpet is like crack to me I played way to much fe in highscool
[3:08:39] <FstSergeant8595> for once i watch Pat when he isnt JUST about to go offline
[3:08:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> thanks
[3:08:43] <%starotter70> @QueequegTheater Yeah, he talked about how broken NG+ is earlier
[3:08:48] <Sir_Walrus> Claude gaaaaaang
[3:08:56] <%QueequegTheater> @Takreth They patched in a free 10K renown for each NG+ so you kind of do get it free
[3:08:57] <+theotherkristian> for real though, how are you enjoying this gameh?
[3:09:09] <Roz_Lynd> that was the crit animation?
[3:09:10] <%StaceMcGate> Bad move little ant
[3:09:12] <+InEzrealwetrust> the 9 %
[3:09:12] <Roz_Lynd> so lame
[3:09:13] <shielded_minitilt> omai wa..
[3:09:16] <+HyperCharge_Sam> oh I forgot he has a new voice
[3:09:18] <+BusinessGiraffe> blue lions babyyyyyyy
[3:09:19] <hntronium> shitty crits
[3:09:20] <%Laecerelius> Does Pat not understand how the lines work?
[3:09:20] <GiygasDrillBreak> all the renown spent in NG is refunded with additional 3000 per difficulty, statues KEEP upgrades
[3:09:25] <ShershaAD> @shielded_minitilt mou
[3:09:30] <10deez> :o
[3:09:31] <ShershaAD> SHINDERU
[3:09:31] <cureneckbeard> That was a bad move, you, are a wizard harry
[3:09:33] <Roz_Lynd> gba animations profoundly superior
[3:09:37] <Valdorick> XP HOG BOIS
[3:09:38] <Onmi_Khaos> "Kill every last one, got it."
[3:09:43] <%QueequegTheater> Man, so much of the BL/GD endgame consisted of me just chucking Byleth and Catherine into massive groups and watching the baddies just disintegrate
[3:09:44] <%starotter70> Holy shit, that's a lot of Renown
[3:09:46] <hntronium> the lamest crits
[3:09:51] <RazHarvey> man crits are massive game breakers
[3:09:53] <GiygasDrillBreak> NG+2 and beyond is only +3000 renown, no refund
[3:09:54] <xtremegamer80> @Roz_Lynd We all know this, no need to bring it up
[3:09:56] <+jacintafor> @AngriestPat do you plan on making felix going full vergil with swords and fist
[3:10:01] <+thackattack00> the gba animations are so good Kreygasm
[3:10:07] <ShichiNoBushi> You're supposed to be teaching the kids! How are they supposed to get EXP- I mean learn?
[3:10:11] <ShershaAD> to quote gandhi "EXTERMINATE THE FILTHY DEVIANTS "
[3:10:13] <Roz_Lynd> someone was tellin me otherwise earlier xtremegamer80
[3:10:21] <%BioApple> @QueequegTheater yeah, I'm halfway through GD and I feel like I could clear the main quest with just lysithea
[3:10:21] <%QueequegTheater> I love that the no damage animation for mages is Royal Guard
[3:10:24] <xtremegamer80> @Roz_Lynd Well they're wrong
[3:10:28] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Sonic Boom!
[3:10:35] <Roz_Lynd> ya dont say! pattyParty
[3:10:37] <%Keyd00d> tfw you've played this so much you just have animations off
[3:10:39] <ShershaAD> @angriestpat any reason you didn't stream it? (sorry for the 6th repost)
[3:10:39] <%Kataguro> Strongest Wall
[3:10:42] <+theotherkristian> are the GBA FE's 80hrs long? then, yes the animations are better
[3:10:42] <%StaceMcGate> happy pat dance
[3:10:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Dedue is doing his best
[3:10:47] <%Monkeyweed21> Dedue sandstorm
[3:10:48] <Quietshun13> I like the assasin crit animation
[3:10:53] <Daxalog> Do they still make super robot wars?
[3:10:56] <FstSergeant8595> NO I just got herrree
[3:10:58] <RazHarvey> too much weed, huh

[3:11:04] <%starotter70> And then it came out
[3:11:06] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> What, this? No way, it's awesome.
[3:11:06] <cureneckbeard> MVP = Most Valuable Pat
[3:11:07] <worldbrand> i was playing it at the time so i wouldnt have watched
[3:11:08] <+jacintafor> the gba fe's are like 25 hrs long
[3:11:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> or this
[3:11:11] <shielded_minitilt> but I enjoy
[3:11:11] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami oh man I forgot to tell you, that game yesterday went to some FUCKEN WEIRDASS places after you left.

[3:11:53] <FstSergeant8595> @AngriestPat any spoopy time games this month?
[3:11:54] <+theotherkristian> Dedue has THE best credits I've ever seen
[3:11:56] <%Laecerelius> That's fine
[3:11:56] <Blank9> teach him axe and fists, forgot armor
[3:11:57] <%Takreth> Kreygasm War God
[3:11:59] <%PatIsMyHero> just fists. like a real warrior
[3:12:03] <%Laecerelius> You can level fist by punching in battle
[3:12:05] <zafooru> oooooooo
[3:12:05] <%goose_attack_almanac> *YES*
[3:12:05] <GiygasDrillBreak> Armor God Dedue
[3:12:06] <lokiluko> heavy armor is just kind of a shit skill aaccross he board
[3:12:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> its never too late to suck a dick.
[3:12:10] <Sir_Walrus> @angriestpat screw heavy armor, make that mans an axe and punch man
[3:12:12] <%bread_assassin> Honestly, drop heavy armor for Dedue. Go axe and fisticuffs,
[3:12:12] <+jacintafor> fist synergizes well with armor units @AngriestPat
[3:12:17] <zafooru> oh man this game is so up pats alley im so excited
[3:12:17] <%starotter70> You don't need to teach him armor honestly
[3:12:18] <Ubu2933> It's kinda great watching a heavy armor punching things to death
[3:12:24] <%TweetHeart> TweetHeart subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[3:12:26] <%Josef_Stryker> Dedue makes for a good War Master I bet
[3:12:26] <+InEzrealwetrust> Praise dedue
[3:12:29] <Onmi_Khaos> @AngriestPat The reason fists are so good is that they always hit twice. So take Dedue's stupid attack stat, and throw in a weapon that always hits twice.
[3:12:29] <%QueequegTheater> EYY BRUDDAH
[3:12:38] <cureneckbeard> Okay hear me out. Paige should cosplay as Princess Peach, and Pat should cosplay as Postman Pat
[3:12:40] <%rubbishbinge> Wait, there's no Shitstorm anymore... ffffffff
[3:12:42] <%Meidolaon> Grand Wizard Ingrid
[3:12:42] <+theotherkristian> Dedue is best girl
[3:12:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> but who's gonna tank hits? I love watching the no damage with big shield
[3:12:47] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Check Ingrid's likes and dislikes
[3:12:49] <Daniel_Is_I> Give that bitch a pegasus. Bitches love pegasi.
[3:12:51] <xtremegamer80> "Ingrid, can you not burn a cross in front of Dedue's dorm for one day, please?"
[3:12:51] <ShershaAD> @angriestpat um, did you play it yourself, if so any opinions? (sorry if the questions are annoying, i just recently got super into ff15)
[3:12:53] <GiygasDrillBreak> Dedue = Raoh
[3:12:57] <%RubberFistFight> @cureneckbeard I'm on board with that.
[3:13:02] <+theotherkristian> I vote for WARMASTER Mercedes benz
[3:13:02] <Doodle_Taco> @queequegtheater He already did

[3:13:05] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[3:13:06] <10deez> Jesus go up

[3:13:13] <%Meidolaon> JESUS GO UP
[3:13:14] <%StaceMcGate> Warrior Lysithea
[3:13:14] <Valdorick> She needs to praise big for the J-man
[3:13:15] <%starotter70> @QueequegTheater We also saw her C support with Dedue
[3:13:16] <Blank9> dedue doesn't get any extra defense from armor knight, he just moves slower
[3:13:21] <Sir_Walrus> The Jesus go UP
[3:13:24] <zafooru> Sword go up tho
[3:13:25] <ShershaAD> @10deez all the way up on the cross
[3:13:32] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat pump that bow
[3:13:32] <Roz_Lynd> i kinda wanna go to ingrid and give her the android 16 speech. "ingrid! ....grow. up."

[3:13:33] <%StaceMcGate> Authority @AngriestPat
[3:13:36] <lokiluko> lances for his master class
[3:13:37] <Blank9> better to have him move far, smash harder, and still take no damage
[3:13:37] <%BioApple> Learn more proverbs so you can call lightning on your foes
[3:13:38] <shozent> NO PAT

[3:13:56] <shozent> FLYING IS USELESS ON HIM
[3:13:56] <Onmi_Khaos> Flying is fine for him
[3:13:56] <zafooru> i made him a thief, kinda regret it since he has one of the thief key abilities as his main power
[3:13:58] <%Kuro_Koshka> No bow class even uses flying besides Claude
[3:13:59] <Sir_Walrus> This is the correct choice
[3:14:00] <%QueequegTheater> NO. BAD PAT
[3:14:01] <%StaceMcGate> nooooo

[3:14:52] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat We overreacted. They're both good choices, but WL will take a little more skill investment

[3:14:56] <Onmi_Khaos> WYVERN BIG GOOD
[3:14:57] <+jacintafor> @AngriestPat don't worry about it you can make him a bow weilding wyvern lord
[3:14:58] <zk_nails> Make Ashe strong boy, make him a Warrior

[3:15:15] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Make Ashe a gremory
[3:15:19] <%bread_assassin> Bow would make a solid ranged options for Wyvern Lords. They're better than hand axes.
[3:15:22] <%StaceMcGate> I always rush Authority to C first
[3:15:27] <shozent> I love this support
[3:15:29] <Sir_Walrus> @angriestpat Wyvern Lord Ashe is more minmax than Bow Knight
[3:15:31] <Onmi_Khaos> Need to start breaking fucking NECKS in this chat

[3:18:59] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Myrmidon. Byleth is so absurdly good at swords that you can literally chuck him at six enemies and watch them crash against him
[3:19:01] <Ominnous> imagine failing your own Exam
[3:19:02] <%Ferakin> Pat, trust me, Beginner classes do nothing for you
[3:19:05] <Sir_Walrus> @angriestpat the beginner classes barely matter, just make sure to make your mages monks and your non mages non monks
[3:19:08] <%Laecerelius> he stab
[3:19:10] <%Kataguro> Soldier good
[3:19:10] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat you can buy more seals from the market, don't forget to replenish battalions
[3:19:11] <GPAlpha> Just do it for the fashion
[3:19:11] <%starotter70> Eh, beginners aren't too important
[3:19:12] <%QueequegTheater> BIG BIG LANCE BIG
[3:19:13] <+HyperCharge_Sam> don't worry too much about the beginner classes, focus more on maxing the intermediate ones
[3:19:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> a lancmin if you would
[3:19:14] <zafooru> Soldier is the Tank tree
[3:19:15] <%Keyd00d> these generic outfits look so bad
[3:19:18] <Doodle_Taco> Lance good
[3:19:18] <zafooru> or class, really
[3:19:18] <@mothmandraws> needs the D to pass
[3:19:19] <Onmi_Khaos> Is it the lance that gave it away?
[3:19:20] <%Ferakin> Get them out of there as soon as possible
[3:19:27] <%Meidolaon> Soldier that boi
[3:19:32] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Dimitri vs. Estinien
[3:19:33] <%Takreth> Oh trust me, Dimitri has the D
[3:19:35] <%Laecerelius> smash good
[3:19:35] <Doodle_Taco> Fight good
[3:19:36] <zafooru> Dedue is a good SOLDIER actually
[3:19:43] <%Keyd00d> Is pat on standard or hard?
[3:19:43] <%Nobrev> fighter is also good at fists
[3:19:44] <zafooru> he rocks as a fortress knight
[3:19:47] <%bread_assassin> It lowkey bugs me that Dimitri's master class isn't mounted.
[3:19:47] <%Kataguro> He passed
[3:19:48] <Ominnous> Mag +1
[3:19:50] <%QueequegTheater> Chat, who would win in an edge-off, Dimitri or Estinien
[3:19:53] <+theotherkristian> Guys do I get the Tokyo Mirage Sessions FE if I've never played shin megami tensei but played FE???
[3:19:54] <%goose_attack_almanac> Thief is great because F!Byleth's monster boobers look gigantic in them :shrug:
[3:19:55] <%Takreth> +1 Res is actually real good
[3:19:57] <GiygasDrillBreak> Certify a <100% for a stat bonus, you automatically get free stat points to meet the class minimum requirement, if you get the class before the minimum stat requirement
[3:20:00] <%StaceMcGate> Estinien
[3:20:02] <%BioApple> make felix a monk just to watch him suffer
[3:20:04] <zafooru> dimitri gets real edgy
[3:20:04] <SodiusChubz> can you make dimitri a chungus armor knight
[3:20:06] <+vdalson> Estinien easily
[3:20:09] <SodiusChubz> ?
[3:20:11] <xtremegamer80> @goose_attack_almanac They look gigantic in everything
[3:20:16] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> ay Pat, have you start on getting Felix's talent in reason up?
[3:20:16] <%Kuro_Koshka> <100% doesnt giver a stat bonus
[3:20:17] <%MisterTylerrr> Oh good, they get fucking armor
[3:20:18] <%Kataguro> Look at that stick
[3:20:20] <%Ferakin> @QueequegTheater Does their edginess rise and fall with their number of eyes?
[3:20:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @AngriestPat the bonus stats are auto for completing the test, if they didn't have them prior
[3:20:26] <%Kuro_Koshka> Stat bonus is if you got shit level ups as its a class minimum
[3:20:28] <zafooru> Felix Reason is a trap in my experience
[3:20:28] <Roz_Lynd> cuz in this game archer is a tier 2 class?
[3:20:30] <Roz_Lynd> pattyGoof
[3:20:32] <%Kuro_Koshka> Percent doesnt matter
[3:20:32] <Ubu2933> God when I finaly got felix in my class he kicked so much ass it wasn't even funny
[3:20:35] <@mothmandraws> estinien wins because he never cleans his armour, always gotta be bloody
[3:20:36] <+vdalson> estinien didn't wash his armor for weeks, he's the master of edge
[3:20:37] <zafooru> Pure swordmaster felix every day over mortal savant
[3:20:44] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat You also have bullions to sell
[3:20:49] <%Takreth> estinien needs to take a shower
[3:20:55] <+treynrek> AEW or NXT?
[3:20:56] <%QueequegTheater> @zafooru Ehh, thoron has helped out quite a few times in my experience
[3:21:05] <%starotter70> Felix's Str and Spd growths are disgusting
[3:21:05] <%Kataguro> Cube
[3:21:06] <+jacintafor> @AngriestPat when you class change to a class your charecters states are set to that classes base stats just in case they are super behinds, thats why Dedue gained mag and res
[3:21:08] <%Keyd00d> that is bullion blazing
[3:21:19] <@mothmandraws> this is first time ive ever actually seen a fire emblem game
[3:21:21] <%bread_assassin> @zafooru The feeling of having to need each unit in a master class was a real pitfall.
[3:21:23] <%StaceMcGate> LOOK AT THOSE STAT ITEMS
[3:21:23] <zafooru> @QueequegTheater I went that route too but ended up mostly just using upgraded levin sword
[3:21:24] <%hazzy_o7> Felix is total beast

[3:29:43] <GiygasDrillBreak> Mercedes is SECOND OLDEST STUDENT
[3:29:47] <%GabeSweetMan> Ironically, Garreg Mach is an ideal learning environment in which students are taught their strengths while their weaknesses are either set aside or reinforced if necessary.

[3:44:18] <Roz_Lynd> pattyHi

[3:44:21] <%Meidolaon> Marianne's too busy S-Supporting the horses to support Bernie

[3:44:32] <%segonian> that's fine, we love cowards
[3:44:42] <%Kataguro> Dimitri is a god tank as a Cavalier
[3:44:43] <%Takreth> Dorte is a good horse

[3:45:34] <%arancet> arancet subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! Any plans to check out Mistover? I looks like Weebest Dungeon
[3:45:34] <%BioApple> I'd kill for a Marianne/Bernie support where there is literally no dialogue
[3:45:38] <+Grayhammatter> that's dumb, but go on
[3:45:38] <%SolverCODO> That's dumb and probably right lol
[3:45:40] <%GabeSweetMan> It's annoying.
[3:45:47] <CorazonFeathers> Yaaay Elmo
[3:45:48] <cureneckbeard> Positive energy skeletons is bullshit! This message posted by negative energy gang
