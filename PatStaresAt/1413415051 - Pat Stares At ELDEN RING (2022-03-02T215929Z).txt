[0:00:38] <MaritimeSpanker> Hello, Chattoos!
[0:00:43] <MidnightPacif1c> SourPls SourPls
[0:00:48] <@MistyMntns> PotFriend
[0:00:50] <MaybeFalco> whats up chat and pat?
[0:01:41] <ape_hawk> i dont even think pat is here
[0:02:01] <@MistyMntns> Pat is always watching
[0:02:09] <ziggy_1031> let hope chat is less obnoxious today LUL
[0:02:16] <MidnightPacif1c> PotFriend
[0:02:17] <%AnthroMetal> Pat is always staring
[0:02:19] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I noticed an early game superbuff for magics, don't know if it applies to faith but I bet it does. Took a basic halberd and applied gravitas to it. it lost like 30 physical and gained like 100 magic damage. So over all it basically doubled in damage for no reason and has carried me up until my int started making somber weapons more powerful,
[0:02:22] <%AnthroMetal> listlessly
[0:02:24] <Pixel_Butts> pats dead, long live PP
[0:02:30] <MaybeFalco> the all-seeing orb
[0:02:41] <%king_wragles> @ape_hawk you should test that by talking mad shit, what's the worst that can happen?
[0:03:00] <@StreamElements> PatStaresAt is now live! Streaming Elden Ring: Pat Stares At ELDEN RING
[0:03:05] <ape_hawk> @ape_hawk HEY PAT, FUCK YOU!
[0:03:14] <%AnthroMetal> just beat rennala. little op, reset my skills now i'm a spellhammer
[0:03:14] <%king_wragles> Thanks Steam Elements
[0:03:46] <dummynummy2> YAYYYY
[0:03:52] <dummynummy2> I’M ALREADY EXCITED
[0:03:57] <dummynummy2> OBSESSED
[0:03:58] <modsformeandyou> Has Pat seen the sorcerer NPC from Stormveil in Roundtable Hold yet? He's on the balcony
[0:04:10] <NewWillinium> I've finally started playing the game myself. Man Wretch is *rough* at the beginning. Especially once you make a decision on where you want magic wise.
[0:04:10] <~PatStaresAt> Yeah I met and did Rogiers quest
[0:04:11] <+MamoruTheRed> I've gotten quite a bit in. won't elaborate on anything other than holy crap bleed weapons
[0:04:15] <+BaronVonJarvis> BaronVonJarvis subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[0:04:15] <%greasypete00> pat found him
[0:04:16] <CheezeWolf> I know when that elden ring
[0:04:18] <@tizz86> tizz86 gifted a Tier 1 sub to dummynummy2! They have given 545 Gift Subs in the channel! 
[0:04:29] <%dummynummy2> wretch is soooo hard at the beginning i feel
[0:04:32] <old_dog_god> What’s popping gamers
[0:04:38] <modsformeandyou> About how far into the game is Pat?
[0:04:44] <%dummynummy2> Rain has an effect btw
[0:04:52] <MaritimeSpanker> God Pat, I'm not gonna spoil it, but I have seen an armor that blows my mind
[0:04:58] <%dummynummy2> when it rains fire gets 10% decrease lightning gets 10% increase
[0:04:58] <%grey_frank> Evening all.
[0:05:06] <%Bluwizard21> @modsformeandyou I'd say 50%
[0:05:07] <MaritimeSpanker> it quite literally might be the single most unique on in the game
[0:05:14] <%dadudewitdadragontattoo> Hello everyone!
[0:05:15] <NewWillinium> @dummynummy2 It really is. I'm half tempted to just start over as a Prisoner, since I decided to at least start as a spell mage
[0:05:15] <%king_wragles> I think Pat is either 1/4 or 1/2 into the game... I actually cannot figure it out
[0:05:22] <~PatStaresAt> me either
[0:05:43] <MaybeFalco> closer to 1/4
[0:05:43] <%king_wragles> Oh ya, poison and bleed do stack
[0:05:49] <%dummynummy2> I started as a wretch and went for a strength build, but now i wanna do a faith build cuz i heard they’re soooo fun
[0:05:50] <MaybeFalco> like probably 1/4 on the dot at most
[0:05:51] <%king_wragles> but I like frostbite and bleed as a combo better
[0:05:51] <MaritimeSpanker> Hell, I hope he takes his time with it
[0:05:52] <tanarath> Based on Vel's play, ~1/3rd-1/2.
[0:05:58] <MaritimeSpanker> these streams are fantastic
[0:05:59] <old_dog_god> I guess an easy way to mark general progress is how many Great Runes you have
[0:06:05] <~PatStaresAt> aw thanks maritime
[0:06:09] <rommlll> show bout to start
[0:06:16] <%king_wragles> Vel has basically beaten it ya, I can't watch him play sadly

[0:07:51] <%GelatinBoi> GelatinBoi subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! Why is it always Orb? In short, let there be Elden Ring.
[0:07:52] <tanarath> it is off
[0:07:53] <%barrakuta371> Watch the map explode 2 times the size again this stream lol.

[0:08:01] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> GOT DAMMIT I still missed the intro
[0:08:03] <modsformeandyou> No spoilers but can someone tell if you can, after you finish the game, go back and get the other possible endings without having to replay the entire game?
[0:08:04] <Pixel_Butts> yes
[0:08:08] <rommlll> do it more
[0:08:08] <%HarrietKingsport> Peach is quiet, definitely mic off.
[0:08:09] <+MamoruTheRed> Checks out
[0:08:09] <%vexion_smh> belly

[0:08:12] <MidnightPacif1c> Kreygasm
[0:08:13] <%MartinOfLoxley> I've been watching Pat's playthrough at work and because I constantly mute I have no idea what the story is.
[0:08:15] <%JoshManVGH> Mic still off.
[0:08:16] <%PocketBearIllustrator> So be careful.

[0:09:57] <%UltraViolet371> that's exactly how we knew it would go down
[0:09:58] <ALazo> I looked away for a second and then I was on top of the tower
[0:10:01] <old_dog_god> Open fun boxes to go to cool places
[0:10:01] <%Kevlar_Caviar> L + Ratio + No Maidens + Foul Tarnished + Meager Flame + Misbegotten + Poisoned + Scarlet Rotten + Frostbitten + Sus
[0:10:02] <%dadudewitdadragontattoo> Caelid is no fun
[0:10:04] <scrumbotime> I solved the riddle of the wizard town

[0:10:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> When I got warped to the beast sanctuary I didn't know you could go in and I ran all the way back through Caelid

[0:10:37] <+xerj> Woolie's about to suplex the Ghost Train
[0:10:38] <%SveriSageAdvice> it IS in fact how you're supposed to get into that tower
[0:10:42] <$MattyNezz> I did Caelid basically first thing. It's my favorite zone

[0:11:16] <+null_the_exhero> Have you fought the other invader in the hub yet?
[0:11:17] <%cade_calrayn> The Ravine *is* how you have to get to the Plateau, Pat, the lift doesn't open until a zone after the Plateau
[0:11:24] <old_dog_god> I want to see it flop gamer man
[0:11:25] <scrumbotime> The Schlub style of seduction, like Bob of Burgers

[0:12:14] <urkleturtle> today i was reminded that this game was made by the people who made the great hollow. the way you have to get to some dungeons or optional bosses is absolutely FUCKED. so paige's way might've been the proper way

[0:23:03] <MaritimeSpanker> Wolves can't spell and Rats can't swim
[0:23:05] <%greasypete00> its not wolves its just the welsh
[0:23:05] <MaritimeSpanker> just the nature of thing
[0:23:10] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It's Welsh for Wolf
[0:23:11] <%dadudewitdadragontattoo> Hahahaha

[0:23:41] <%delilah4you> Pat did you find the crucible knight in Stormveil yet?
[0:23:43] <scrumbotime> Blaaid
[0:23:47] <%Bluwizard21> lovecraft wasn't friendly with the welsh
[0:23:51] <knotsundownsyndrome> there are two wolves in this game named "wolf the wolf"
[0:23:51] <%delilah4you> Hurray!
[0:23:52] <rudiciuscaesar> Wolf-Raiden powers
[0:24:05] <urkleturtle> there's also a wolf named lobo in this game, so they're not the most creative with names
[0:24:09] <%CeeKay_Plays> Guys, for some reason my TV's twitch app won't let me watch Pats streams and only his streams. Any idea what the cause is?
[0:24:10] <Sunstalker> Pat, you found the Flamberge yet? That things looks so pretty now
[0:24:12] <knotsundownsyndrome> i don't know if george or fromsoft did that but it's goofy as fuck
[0:24:13] <digaogrunge> All wolves are called wolf in this game, chick had a pet wolf named Lobo
[0:24:16] <MaritimeSpanker> NOICE
[0:24:17] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt did you find the illusory floor in rannis area?

[0:24:40] <scrumbotime> they are capable fighters
[0:24:40] <rudiciuscaesar> woah fart gas
[0:24:49] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Pat I havent fully caught up with your vods, has FromSoft added a bullshit puzzle boss that you have seen? I really feel they can't make a game without one
[0:24:50] <it_came_from_outer_space> sirrice77 excuse me the what
[0:25:06] <%Dakuu75> yeah, you only need enough faith or intelligence to USE the spells. there are items that let your spells scale with other shit
[0:25:06] <%cade_calrayn> I'm still confused as to how/why Godwyn the Golden is under Stormveil
[0:25:13] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt dex actually increases spell cast speed noticeably for once
[0:25:15] <kazadog> i went 18/18 on my faith build to dual wield flails

[0:30:11] <+Kyma1020> you may need horse
[0:30:16] <%Sirtimbob> Check out the Scrimblos on paige!
[0:30:17] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> PAT DID THE YUM YUM LUL
[0:30:20] <@QueequegTheater> @Kyma1020 No room for horse
[0:30:24] <signofzeta> yeah, the erdtree avatars in caelid are hardasses
[0:30:24] <%Dakuu75> AW YEAH~!!! Pat unironically doing "Numnumnumnumnum" D
[0:30:35] <tidesplitter27> Lol scarlet toe jam
[0:30:49] <%delilah4you> they spray their goo far
[0:31:09] <elwrathh> tree too big
[0:31:23] <Holycow8498> Scarlet demon
[0:31:24] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I think fire does more on this guy
[0:31:37] <deviljhojho_> bro you're getting blimbo'd
[0:31:41] <deviljhojho_> blimbofication even
[0:31:43] <%shootbang_exe> it got that scarlet russy
[0:31:54] <Holycow8498> scarlet demon defeated
[0:31:54] <elwrathh> so agile
[0:31:54] <%vexion_smh> PogChamp
[0:31:56] <%delilah4you> scrimbloification complete
[0:31:56] <deviljhojho_> i always believed
[0:31:57] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt can you explain Rune Arcs? also nice job
[0:32:01] <%Dakuu75> did Pat's eyes ever turn yellow?
[0:32:18] <deviljhojho_> whats with the pots
[0:32:32] <%RealThiele> theres a catacombs right here too
[0:32:39] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt all the GREAT runes have passive powers and rune ARCS enhance the effect. So godricks is a +1 that increases to a +5 after using a rune arc
[0:32:39] <urkleturtle> everything in caelid sucks
[0:32:39] <rudiciuscaesar> huge pots but human sized door?
[0:32:42] <it_came_from_outer_space> I really like how elden ring instills a fondness for places you get your shit rocked
[0:32:44] <MaybeFalco> @cade_calrayn humanity
[0:32:48] <chernabogs_bane> i was hoping pat would see that door. i missed it on my first try
[0:32:50] <KitsuneManami> The Warrior of Azaroth and  Alphino saved  Anduin from the Eyes of the Jailer
[0:32:54] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Did you ever find that Pot guy you helped again?
[0:32:57] <%cade_calrayn> Ahhhhh
[0:33:09] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt square removes it
[0:33:11] <deviljhojho_> godrick mroe like godwimp
[0:33:13] <lucasnunez90> level up
[0:33:16] <MrGuy516> I fell asleep during last night's stream, did he finish the academy?
[0:33:17] <MaritimeSpanker> Pat never activated the other great rune he got?
[0:33:17] <%cade_calrayn> Alexander is nearby, yes, he's in a tunnel
[0:33:20] <%TheAdMerlin> Pat you said you wanted to level
[0:33:22] <KitsuneManami> i KNEW you would be using these Weapons
[0:33:25] <%PrimalDweeb> Hey Pat, how is that curved sword you're using? I just got it myself this morning.
[0:33:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think it doesn't show stat buffs in the level up screen
[0:33:33] <Holycow8498> Weren't you gonna level Pat?
[0:33:38] <KitsuneManami> @PrimalDweeb Its VERY Risky
[0:33:43] <%RealThiele> this place does not fuck around
[0:33:56] <Holycow8498> Does crazy talk make the user do the opposite of what they say they are gonna do?
[0:33:59] <%cade_calrayn> Oh yeah have fun with this one
[0:34:02] <MidnightPacif1c> 30k Jebaited
[0:34:02] <%cade_calrayn> It SUCKS
[0:34:12] <%vexion_smh> oh this fucking place
[0:34:13] <deviljhojho_> incoming shitshow
[0:34:22] <rudiciuscaesar> The Depths Goo cameo
[0:34:29] <%PrimalDweeb> @PrimalDweeb Yeah? It feels a little weak to me, which is why I was asking.
[0:34:34] <%thepaintedring> these goo monsters. every game
[0:34:35] <KitsuneManami> @PatStaresAt what level are you at now.
[0:34:42] <it_came_from_outer_space> returning favorite from soft character: goo
[0:35:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> you know, Pat seems pretty well equipped for Caelid
[0:35:07] <deviljhojho_> heavy weapons dont seem overwhelmingly strong compared to lighter equivalents
[0:35:10] <%Dakuu75> same
[0:35:10] <%Mantorok06> Is there pyromancy in elden ring?
[0:35:12] <BelchinBuckaroo> What are the rules about backseating? If there's some cool shit that your missing, do you want us to call it out?
[0:35:15] <%thepaintedring> you're gonna want it for later
[0:35:22] <KitsuneManami> @Mantorok06 yes
[0:35:23] <deviljhojho_> nice
[0:35:23] <ppangboi> @Mantorok06 yes its tied to faith now
[0:35:24] <%Rbeatononefour> 69 nice
[0:35:25] <+NeonFishFace> nice
[0:35:26] <KitsuneManami> 69 LUL :P
[0:35:27] <%Order_of_Mystery> the dragon spells are so cool, and they totally make up for how lame dragon form was in das3
[0:35:31] <+tizziks> 69 nice
[0:35:42] <%Dakuu75> @Mantorok06 not like, a "pyromancy" category but, there's tons of fire spells
[0:35:44] <%Sirtimbob> What does scarlet rot do?
[0:35:53] <deviljhojho_> it kills ya
[0:35:56] <KitsuneManami> wuts wrong with the WHITE FLAME HUH?  seriously tho white fire is rad. shame its not in any games
[0:36:00] <rudiciuscaesar> dananana
[0:36:02] <%RealThiele> scarlet rot is toxic
[0:36:03] <@QueequegTheater> @Sirtimbob Like plague from DeS
[0:36:06] <sirrice77> but pat thats old people music
[0:36:06] <%Sirtimbob> Thats fair, thanks
[0:36:10] <rudiciuscaesar> yeaahhhh!!
[0:36:14] <+Kyma1020> what does black flame do in this game?
[0:36:15] <zanzibarian_hamster> who?
[0:36:15] <it_came_from_outer_space> @PatStaresAt btw i dont know this for sure but the eye beam might have more range than the lightning bolt in case you care about that
[0:36:16] <deviljhojho_> im allergic to you dontcha know that im toxic
[0:36:20] <%JoshManVGH> Leave Britney a olds!
[0:36:28] <@QueequegTheater> Damn it now I'm gonna be listening to old Britney songs all day, thanks Pat
[0:36:28] <KitsuneManami> Super Tox ic 2 Super Toxic
[0:36:30] <%dadudewitdadragontattoo> @patstaresat how is the pvp in this game?
[0:36:36] <%Order_of_Mystery> so toxic extended
[0:36:44] <+678saintglock> man have you seen the lake of rot yet
[0:36:51] <%ReugaLive> sure is
[0:37:07] <deviljhojho_> very nice
[0:37:13] <+678saintglock> actually nvm nvm
[0:37:13] <%JoshManVGH> Oh damn...
[0:37:16] <%sonuke_draws> wow
[0:37:18] <KitsuneManami> What was that Block Swing? is that for this weapon?
[0:37:22] <Sunstalker> IF you don't parry, might as well jsut use a greatshield
[0:37:24] <CheezeWolf> yuniiNOTED
[0:37:26] <penitentpendant> Ah, they never fixed it from the network test
[0:37:28] <%RealThiele> so big poise increase
[0:37:29] <%thepaintedring> do you know if there is a cap on respec or is it unlimited as long as you have the item?
[0:37:29] <BelchinBuckaroo> I got to Caelid through Sofria right after the first Godrick.  I just thought I needed to Git Gud and did most of the area.  Turns out running into the second boss with a +5 boss weapon trivializes things
[0:37:30] <@QueequegTheater> @KitsuneManami Every weapon has a block counter now
[0:37:34] <%JoshManVGH> Hmm. But Unsheath with shield though...
[0:37:38] <%delilah4you> ?Oh pat I found the orb finger equivilant, all I'll say is you're on the right path, so keep goin
[0:37:42] <%Reaped_Psyche> What is that swoooord?
[0:37:46] <rudiciuscaesar> what are these enemies, they look like they're made out of stone but their feet make a pitter patter sound
[0:38:01] <Notsocleveruser> Greatshields with barricade dont lose stamina at all
[0:38:04] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat Got any advice for double spears?
[0:38:14] <%RealThiele> these imps are fuckers is what they are
[0:38:20] <KitsuneManami> @QueequegTheater  how do you shield counter? pressing L2 just uses the art
[0:38:32] <@QueequegTheater> @KitsuneManami R2 after blocking an attack
[0:38:40] <%dadudewitdadragontattoo> The boss isn’t that hard in this area tbh
[0:38:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> This game really feels like you can make any build into the most busted shit ever
[0:38:47] <KitsuneManami> Ooooooh! Cool
[0:38:54] <%Jeemukun> Jeemukun subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[0:39:02] <NewWillinium> You can also do it when blocking with your two handed weapon
[0:39:03] <KitsuneManami> I thought it was just like a, bonus damage attack if u attack right after a block
[0:39:10] <%ReugaLive> barricade also makes attacking more likely to bounce
[0:39:12] <deviljhojho_> this place is a shithole
[0:39:13] <MaritimeSpanker> Pretty and nasty
[0:39:20] <MaritimeSpanker> aww
[0:39:24] <@QueequegTheater> I got here at like level 30
[0:39:25] <MaritimeSpanker> poor craffe
[0:39:27] <@QueequegTheater> Was not fun
[0:39:29] <KitsuneManami> Looks like Crabs BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
[0:39:29] <%Rbeatononefour> *pinch*
[0:39:30] <%machshop> some sort of cave demon
[0:39:32] <%PrimalDweeb> I guess people just straight up ignored the tutorial...
[0:39:33] <%JoshManVGH> dog?
[0:39:33] <Goergorion> 🦀 🦀 🦀 🦀
[0:39:34] <deviljhojho_> whats with the pots and crabs theme of this game
[0:39:38] <it_came_from_outer_space> Is there any zone in this game without crabs?!?
[0:39:38] <KitsuneManami> Try Walls?
[0:39:40] <@QueequegTheater> MISTER SNIP SNIP RETURNS
[0:39:42] <Happydisaster> Oh that’s for Oleg

[0:44:10] <deviljhojho_> real talk lads am i stuck farming the shit goblins for runes early game?
[0:44:23] <deviljhojho_> Feels like most other mobs drop pennies
[0:44:31] <penitentpendant> ...there's gotta be a modern version of 'The Thinker' with a man looking at his phone on the toilet by now?
[0:44:33] <%Mantorok06> There's always the steel ball run

[0:46:38] <+goblinking92> its in liurnia in the fire monk camp
[0:46:38] <rudiciuscaesar> poochie wolf wolf head
[0:46:43] <penitentpendant> @realm_forge Welcome to Pat and Paige's streams! You put thing in your mouth at your own risk~
[0:46:44] <Omenaire_> that is a big sword
[0:46:47] <tidesplitter27> Where do you get this incantation at?
[0:46:47] <%delilah4you> Pat did you kill Rogier?
[0:46:51] <%delilah4you> You have his hat
[0:46:59] <$realm_forge> Yeah....
[0:47:01] <r0flwaffles> oh which weapon is that one
[0:47:03] <rudiciuscaesar> "I don't recall..."
[0:47:06] <%delilah4you> Was the natural cause a knife you put between his shoulder blades?
[0:47:09] <%Dakuu75> that spell is by the "Eastern Tableland" grace in an enemy encampment. (the remove scarlet rot)
[0:47:10] <%JoshManVGH> Threw himself upon your sword?
[0:47:20] <+TryJake> pat is kinda bad at video games :/
[0:47:23] <ape_hawk> pat, nothing in the soulsborne games is natural
[0:47:24] <old_dog_god> Thank you gamers
[0:47:32] <%delilah4you> I kid, he did that to me too halfway through his quest
[0:47:36] <%Kevlar_Caviar> yeah, it's only natural that someone would die when you drop a brick on their head Kappa
[0:47:44] <%delilah4you> Apparently at some point in the game he just gets sick and dies, and theres fuckall you can do about it
[0:47:50] <%Order_of_Mystery> he died of ligma
[0:47:56] <modsformeandyou> Pat do you think that if Sekiro 2 ever happens it'll be open world?
[0:48:11] <+Akizea> yall know that weather can affect your damage?
[0:48:20] <%Kevlar_Caviar> WHAT
[0:48:20] <plaguedoctor_vi> there is a tunnel in that swamp part you just passed
[0:48:28] <deviljhojho_> dunno if sekiro benefits from the open world structure
[0:48:35] <plaguedoctor_vi> oh sorry
[0:48:36] <penitentpendant> Sekiro 2: Journey to the West (I guess)
[0:48:40] <lockhead45> I dont think they will do another open world again or at least not for a long time
[0:48:43] <@Spydurman> Sekiro feels like the least likely to get a sequel
[0:48:43] <%Dakuu75> he opened a door to this palce
[0:48:45] <ape_hawk> "came in that tunnel"
[0:48:50] <mrtanaka111> whatever they release after this game is gonna be a letdown
[0:48:50] <deviljhojho_> sekiro 2: monkey buddy edition
[0:48:53] <modsformeandyou> Sekiro has grappling hook
[0:48:55] <%Bluwizard21> PAtches patched me
[0:48:56] <Happydisaster> I’d much rather it not be open world
[0:48:57] <ShinyVagikarp> We already got Sekiro 2 it's Elden Ring with the samurai class KappaHD
[0:49:05] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Spydurman which is weird, because the true ending is BIG sequelbait
[0:49:05] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I still  have Toxic in my head
[0:49:06] <%PrimalDweeb> I knew it
[0:49:06] <deviljhojho_> oh no
[0:49:09] <Happydisaster> Feels that’s unneeded
[0:49:10] <it_came_from_outer_space> lmao
[0:49:10] <%AnthroMetal> oh yeah this fight
[0:49:11] <MaritimeSpanker> PREPARE FOR TROUBLE
[0:49:11] <lockhead45> Bloodborne is the one most deserving of a sequel
[0:49:13] <%PrimalDweeb> Fuck these guys
[0:49:13] <SinnerEbru> OOPS
[0:49:14] <MaritimeSpanker> AND MAKE IT DOUBLE

[0:49:31] <%PrimalDweeb> The magic one sucks ass
[0:49:31] <+Akizea> if you do a fire attack in rain it deals less damage and if you do a lightning attack in rain it deals more damage
[0:49:32] <+Deadlymuffin5> Was having the hardest time with some bosses then remembered it was all on me to level my VIT properly :P
[0:49:35] <deviljhojho_> thats some absurd damage
[0:49:36] <coreyyotto> Agni and Rudra

[0:49:48] <BelchinBuckaroo> Their only attack is to dunk on you
[0:49:48] <plaguedoctor_vi> can we talk about cool item or equipament we find in this stream?
[0:49:50] <signofzeta> this is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!
[0:49:50] <%AnthroMetal> i honestly don't know how to do this fight without a summon
[0:49:52] <%vexion_smh> and they were roommates

[0:50:15] <Jakeawienas> same thing happened to me

[0:51:21] <elwrathh> such a weird boss
[0:51:21] <MaritimeSpanker> God, something about their movements is really unsettling
[0:51:22] <%twohitgood> I saw Max do this one. good luck. having oleg should help.
[0:51:23] <modsformeandyou> @spydurman Sekiro ended with open ending and it's published by Activision who definitely wants a sequel to a multimillion selling Goty
[0:51:25] <%PrimalDweeb> @Akizea You sure? I could have sworn the game told me explained that's how it worked.
[0:51:28] <rudiciuscaesar> aw cool, they even have like little Spanish frilly collars
[0:51:32] <+sambws> Would you say bloodflame/buffs are better than using Ashes to give your weapon an attribute?
[0:51:47] <+Akizea> @primaldweeb this is the only one rn that's broken, it works on every other work
[0:51:48] <CheezeWolf> halosweetRIP
[0:51:48] <mrtanaka111> greedu

[0:51:59] <$Smokay17> Were you able to upgrade Oleg to +5?
[0:52:02] <%JoshManVGH> Cat slapped you with them cheeks
[0:52:04] <%Kevlar_Caviar> man, theDeModcracy's boss ranking of this game is gonna take a while huh
[0:52:10] <+sandwich_jones> elden ring is the titanfall 2  of soul reavers
[0:52:25] <+Akizea> @primaldweeb cause think about it, there's one by the crucible knight evergaol that has no arms and it works
[0:52:26] <MaritimeSpanker> Oh duuuude
[0:52:29] <%AnthroMetal> do you have any hammers? since they're stone
[0:52:32] <+Local16> Bloodflame is good cause it keeps ticking blood when you're not hitting
[0:52:40] <MaritimeSpanker> imagine a soul reaver remake in the style of this
[0:52:44] <%Monkeyweed21> Will Bleeding work on statues
[0:52:56] <elwrathh> get in there oleg

[0:53:35] <MaritimeSpanker> They don't seem to have arteries
[0:53:37] <sirrice77> @sandwich_jones yes
[0:53:38] <%sniffy77> do they even have blood?
[0:53:39] <+Deosier> oleg really did his best
[0:53:49] <Guardiansaiyan> You can do it! VirtualHug <3
[0:53:53] <it_came_from_outer_space> pretty sure they have approx. 0L of blood in their stone bodies
[0:53:53] <digaogrunge> NEED VEINS TO BLEED
[0:53:55] <%PrimalDweeb> @Akizea You miss understood me, if the shrine HAS arms; it won't work. If it doesn't have arms, it works.
[0:53:59] <Sol_Install> oh this boss, max has some fun with this one

[0:54:07] <%BonewheelVanguard> you could try taping them for sap?
[0:54:09] <%LorcaNomad> in my experience statues don't bleed, yeah
[0:54:23] <elwrathh> apparantly squeezing blood from a stone is true
[0:54:24] <AlexJacobVO> I don't like the kitties
[0:54:29] <deviljhojho_> fuck
[0:54:29] <+Akizea> @primaldweeb I'm 99% sure it still works
[0:54:30] <CheezeWolf> 1/2
[0:54:33] <eleskei> they look like they have bad posture from severe back problems
[0:54:36] <Crimpson> Should be easy to get the other
[0:54:36] <%dadudewitdadragontattoo> Lets go PAt! @PatStaresAt
[0:54:39] <+thickshield> ive just encountered my favorite souls enemy ever. big ball

[0:55:19] <%LorcaNomad> that stab was so fast tho
[0:55:22] <mrtanaka111> we feed on pats tears today
[0:55:25] <%delilah4you> @elwrathh You mean IRL? water pipes leaking rusted water onto the states over time.
[0:55:28] <+Jeshk0> any good AOE spells you can use?
[0:55:35] <%PrimalDweeb> Pat, before you enter the boss area again; can you look at the shrine just outside it?
[0:55:45] <+spottedwolf10> Rot?
[0:55:55] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Your magma pour?
[0:55:58] <+Resderp> I think they are vulnerable to strike damage like maces, though?
[0:56:01] <MaybeFalco> @PrimalDweeb its just bugged dude
[0:56:04] <%PrimalDweeb> See, arms
[0:56:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> true to real life
[0:56:16] <%cade_calrayn> that is odd that it has arms
[0:56:17] <%delilah4you> Yeah I think the erd tree shrine is interfering with it
[0:56:17] <%PrimalDweeb> Arms means it doesn't work.
[0:56:18] <old_dog_god> Maybe try a hammer or something? That’s supposed to be good against stony enemies
[0:56:24] <%cade_calrayn> all the others don't
[0:56:25] <%delilah4you> How long does that Physick last? It seems powerful
[0:56:27] <+RidGaming> whats the buff incantation your using?
[0:56:27] <%PrimalDweeb> The game literally tells you this.
[0:56:27] <+jennyfurific> Yeah its weird that stake doesnt work
[0:56:32] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> It has arms. The arms have to be gone? @PrimalDweeb
[0:56:54] <+Resderp> @delilah4you A lot of the buff physicks seem to last an entire boss fight for me.
[0:56:54] <%RigmaroleHM> Hope those pillars weren't weight-bearing
[0:56:57] <%PrimalDweeb> Yes, the arms have to be gone for it to work.
[0:57:07] <verscoll> bonked
[0:57:08] <kinkade_77> does that sword scale off faith
[0:57:10] <%PrimalDweeb> It's a lore thing
[0:57:12] <old_dog_god> He has the Marika icon on his meters, that means it’s supposed to be working
[0:58:07] <Crimpson> gg
[0:58:08] <signofzeta> nice!
[0:58:09] <deviljhojho_> nice
[0:58:10] <$Smokay17> There are others with arms that do work. This one is bugged. It's been talked about before.

[1:06:21] <modsformeandyou> Would a FromSoft Souls-like in which you travel on a sea with a ship discovering islands that have things on them work?
[1:06:23] <penitentpendant> You really do
[1:06:26] <titanor3> Just came in, has he encountered him yet?
[1:06:31] <%Kevlar_Caviar> big health is REQUIRED to beat this game
[1:06:34] <%Axellogic> Octopus are weak to heavy attacks
[1:06:37] <eleskei> octohussy
[1:06:39] <AlexJacobVO> You killed her babbies.. mommapus is not happy
[1:06:40] <%Kevlar_Caviar> like, VERY BIG health
[1:06:45] <penitentpendant> Unfortunately, VIG is one of those 'boring stats'
[1:06:47] <%Pyon84> Big damage
[1:06:48] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> 40 vigor gang
[1:06:48] <it_came_from_outer_space> You do but also things in this game just do STUPID big damage forever
[1:06:50] <+null_the_exhero> @modsformeandyou You mean Wind Waker lol
[1:06:52] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> It was healing?!
[1:06:52] <penitentpendant> So people avoid it
[1:06:55] <$MattyNezz> This area has a few earlier enemies with buffed stats. Maybe the excuse is that they have Scarlett Riot, idk
[1:06:56] <CheezeWolf> maiyadClap cheezed
[1:06:59] <SomeAsianDood> That's a tanky octussy
[1:07:02] <%Brassnarwhal> you can cut off the long tentacles so it's range is shorter
[1:07:07] <%PrimalDweeb> @modsformeandyou Depending on the size of the islands, I don't see why not.
[1:07:09] <eleskei> oh it is a girl one
[1:07:09] <mrtanaka111> wabuu shit
[1:07:10] <%hewlettfan96> More obscure question has anyone ever seen /v/ video game suffering chart? Measuring how video game characters suffered vs how much suffering they deserved?
[1:07:12] <MaritimeSpanker> OH SHIT, I*VE HEARD OF THAT ONE
[1:07:12] <%Axellogic> @PatStaresAt  that spear is amazing cause bleed, I also put frost on it for extra bullshit
[1:07:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> @modsformeandyou a decade from now we'll be playing that game where you can sail between 5 maps as big as this one
[1:07:15] <%topendbuzza> sounds rad
[1:07:20] <MaritimeSpanker> It's meant to be as fast as a Katana
[1:07:21] <deviljhojho_> nippon steel
[1:07:23] <%hewlettfan96> Japanese would love this lol
[1:07:26] <Blank9> bleed spear
[1:07:27] <%Dakuu75> SIC
[1:07:29] <DestroPrime83> oh shit Naginatas are fucking sick
[1:07:33] <eleskei> wtf do you do with a octopus ovum
[1:07:36] <+anoldtoilet> oh thats a sick moveset
[1:07:39] <rudiciuscaesar> oh it's a curved yari
[1:07:44] <%Brassnarwhal> woolie weapon?
[1:07:44] <penitentpendant> @hewlettfan96 That sounds like bait for "The Last of Us" fans
[1:07:44] <mrtanaka111> so they have japan but cant add black people?
[1:07:45] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Been using this forever cool as hell
[1:07:47] <eleskei> or whatever is it you picked up
[1:07:49] <MaritimeSpanker> extremely pleasing moveset
[1:07:52] <rudiciuscaesar> fight some horsemen with that bitch
[1:07:54] <+678saintglock> where is this?
[1:07:54] <MaritimeSpanker> Perfect cave for Samurai
[1:07:55] <%Axellogic> You can stab from behind sheild too for extreme safety while you proc status
[1:07:56] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> runes
[1:07:57] <BelchinBuckaroo> I did a strength build my first playthrough, and I'm finding all the greatsword scale with like int or faith
[1:07:59] <ebrion> Souls?
[1:08:01] <deeewooh> how would you rank this compared to other souls games?
[1:08:05] <djblue_shift> That’s a sick spear moveset
[1:08:06] <shootybooty1> SOULS?
[1:08:06] <%PrimalDweeb> Yeah, I like wide swings personally.
[1:08:08] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> your runes pats
[1:08:09] <DestroPrime83> dude if i even wanted to play this game that would be my weapon for the whole game
[1:08:10] <+tizziks> Runes pat?
[1:08:15] <kingmemelord97> huh pars stamina didn't go down
[1:08:22] <kingmemelord97> pats
[1:08:26] <femto216> Your runes
[1:08:42] <plaguedoctor_vi> Hey Pat do you have a talisman that increses the power of encatation?
[1:08:43] <DestroPrime83> Polearms are the coolest type of weapons ever made
[1:08:46] <shootybooty1> 11k almost down the drain LOLW
[1:08:49] <%Brassnarwhal> @kingmemelord97 stamina is only used during combat
[1:08:58] <%hewlettfan96> @penitentpendant No it’s amazing it’s like a chart of points of 5 to 100 5 being no suffering 100 being complete hellish suffering, and on the x axis is how much they deserve to suffer on how good/ evil they are
[1:09:06] <PunishedFurby> i'm sensing several OSHA violations in this mine
[1:09:22] <+678saintglock> what is this place called
[1:09:42] <deviljhojho_> they keep it hardcore in caelid
[1:10:09] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> THe Octo Room is where your runes are
[1:10:10] <ebrion> Runes are in the Land Octopus room
[1:10:11] <%Axellogic> @678saintglock Gael tunnel
[1:10:12] <KasiCrafter> Caelib has a rot issue, so I imagine fire magic is kind of a necessity
[1:10:14] <%topendbuzza> octo
[1:10:22] <%hewlettfan96> So if you at suffering 5 deserved 100 ur means your a complete evil bastard taht got away with everything, if your at suffering 100 deserved 5 it means you had the worst suffering and didn’t deserve any of it
[1:10:24] <Blank9> Pat, did you ever find the helmet in the starting area that increases damage taken but reduces fp cost of incantations?
[1:10:26] <TheHotStuven> DJ CAELID
[1:10:27] <modsformeandyou> Which one is better Pat, Bloodborne or Elden Ring?
[1:10:35] <+678saintglock> @axellogic tysm
[1:10:40] <%PrimalDweeb> Well, more runes for you.
[1:10:45] <+benbag13> hey pat what is the weapon
[1:10:52] <%topendbuzza> I think he did
[1:10:53] <%hewlettfan96> Lucas from Earthbound Is at deserved none suffering 100 😢
[1:10:57] <%Axellogic> @678saintglock after something in the cave?
[1:11:03] <%epide> pat only has one of them
[1:11:13] <%hewlettfan96> The monster from chrono trigger is at deserved 100 suffering none
[1:11:19] <%Brassnarwhal> the noose ne that reduces the fp of weapon arts he definitely picked up
[1:11:20] <rudiciuscaesar> This game suffers from an abundance of choice then?
[1:11:23] <+fyreba113r> @patstaresat it’s the scarab hat
[1:11:32] <%topendbuzza> wolf pat is cool anyway
[1:11:36] <penitentpendant> @hewlettfan96 It'd be interesting to look at. But it's definitely something subjective that could lead to arguments (with the good path being debate).
[1:11:41] <deviljhojho_> it do be stupid lookin
[1:11:47] <%Brassnarwhal> @brassnarwhal nevermind me i just woke up and my thumbs don't work
[1:11:48] <PunishedFurby> scarab hat is quite a look
[1:11:53] <%elwrathh> uh oh
[1:11:59] <+678saintglock> ye @axellogic also just trying to look for places i haven’t been to in caelid
[1:12:02] <NewWillinium> So I like how they actually implemented the Chalice dungeons into the actual game world this time around.
[1:12:07] <$MattyNezz> open little for
[1:12:12] <%Valdorick> Now fight the boss Kappa
[1:12:13] <MaritimeSpanker> This can't go deeper, can it?
[1:12:15] <$MattyNezz> little door
[1:12:16] <%Brassnarwhal> @rudiciuscaesar wouldn't say suffers from it but you are drowning in options at all times
[1:12:20] <sirrice77> oh someone was supposed to be there
[1:12:21] <+benbag13> @patstaresat what are you wielding?
[1:12:21] <%elwrathh> do it
[1:12:22] <%topendbuzza> yeah!
[1:12:23] <deviljhojho_> could get ugly
[1:12:24] <%PrimalDweeb> Don't worry about it
[1:12:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> keep going that way just a bit
[1:12:26] <CheezeWolf> shyyHmm
[1:12:28] <%cade_calrayn> Wait
[1:12:32] <%PrimalDweeb> LUL
[1:12:33] <+fyreba113r> Aw no big iron friend
[1:12:35] <+eanscrale> nah it's fine
[1:12:37] <plaguedoctor_vi> it a easy boss
[1:12:37] <%cade_calrayn> Hold up, that's weird - Alexander should be there, Pat
[1:12:41] <modsformeandyou> Pat is Elden Ring better than Bloodborne?
[1:12:44] <penitentpendant> Oh boy! More hearts!
[1:12:45] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> You have his weapon
[1:12:49] <eleskei> ew this monster is ugly
[1:12:50] <%hewlettfan96> @penitentpendant Yeah it is look it up if you wanna know who’s 100 x 100 a purely evil game character who got pure hell deserved suffering it’s ganandorf from legend of Zelda, I kinda agree honestly
[1:12:53] <SQDizzy> what level is Pat?
[1:12:57] <%shootbang_exe> he wasn't there for me so pat should be fine
[1:13:01] <plaguedoctor_vi> it just that the site of grace it for a zone behide
[1:13:03] <MaybeFalco> yeah he chunky
[1:13:04] <sendart> the only hard thing about this dude is his charge attack
[1:13:10] <+Nero_Cross> @cade_calrayn He doesn't show up if you never go to the blocked other side of this cave
[1:13:12] <%Brassnarwhal> does this count as a dragon?
[1:13:18] <eleskei> you know those wings dont work either
[1:13:22] <rudiciuscaesar> @Brassnarwhal I feel ya. In some of these games, especially Skyrim-like games, there's always a point where I get anxiety because my OCD tells me I have to try EVERYTHING once lol.
[1:13:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> the guy is only there if you get there early
[1:13:24] <%Kevlar_Caviar> maybe the magma wyrm weapon isn't the best weapon to use against a magma wyrm lmao
[1:13:24] <%Valdorick> It is a Dragon, drops a heart
[1:13:27] <plaguedoctor_vi> yes for some reason
[1:13:29] <DestroPrime83> yes pat attack the Fire Lizard with fire weapon
[1:13:36] <%cade_calrayn> @Nero_Cross I never did - the first time I entered the tunnel was from the other side and then I opened the door and met him
[1:13:37] <XxMoliciousxX> dragonkin with a sword, how's that fair lol
[1:13:40] <modsformeandyou> Pat is Elden Ring better than Bloodborne?
[1:13:42] <%PrimalDweeb> It's a salamander
[1:13:44] <jbrachob> incoming Dual wielding dragon swords???
[1:13:44] <%topendbuzza> bleed is insane
[1:13:47] <%elwrathh> wh
[1:13:47] <%PrimalDweeb> A dead one
[1:13:47] <femto216> Fire vs fire?
[1:13:47] <%Pyon84> The number of unique memorable events in this game is probably higher than the number of unique memorable moments in my actual life...
[1:13:54] <%Axellogic> You got magmad
[1:13:54] <penitentpendant> @hewlettfan96 Depends on which Ganon. Since he's stuck in an 'incarnation cycle' each on has its own sins. Aggregating it would be unfair to the scale.
[1:13:55] <%Brassnarwhal> just atance break him then if the weapon doesnt do enough damage
[1:13:55] <kazadog> blood dismounter is a hilarious name for a weapon tbh
[1:13:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[1:14:01] <rudiciuscaesar> this boss is cool as fuck, holy shit, dragon dude with a sword, that's too rad for me
[1:14:07] <%PrimalDweeb> Oh? Never mind.
[1:14:14] <+eanscrale> The weapon here is mostly for dex/int anyway
[1:14:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> you could've come here from the very start
[1:14:17] <it_came_from_outer_space> lmao
[1:14:19] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt PotBoi was supposed to be behind the door next to the Grace, the door was locked and he couldn't figure out how to get through it
[1:14:20] <+Akizea> that sword is fuckinnnnnggg wild
[1:14:22] <%Rbeatononefour> tf we doin here??
[1:14:22] <rudiciuscaesar> wow, the rain looks great
[1:14:22] <$MattyNezz> That slam does a LOT of damage, always look for it
[1:14:23] <%Brassnarwhal> lmao
[1:14:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> big shortcuts
[1:14:29] <%greasypete00> rear entrance
[1:14:31] <deviljhojho_> how about that
[1:14:33] <%greasypete00> time for rear
[1:14:34] <%elwrathh> no you
[1:14:35] <%topendbuzza> no you
[1:14:38] <modsformeandyou> Pat is Elden Ring better than Bloodborne?
[1:14:42] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> This is how Max got to Caelid
[1:14:44] <%SveriSageAdvice> that sword is basically just the Yamato
[1:14:44] <%hewlettfan96> @penitentpendant Who would you put at 100, 100 a video game character that’s pure evil but got everything they deserved?
[1:14:51] <MaybeFalco> pat have you found alexander yet?
[1:14:53] <razz_zie> I think the theme I've gotten from this game so far is that if u give the giant grotesque monster a fancy weapon, they become cooler
[1:14:55] <deviljhojho_> they are too different to compare tbh
[1:14:59] <rudiciuscaesar> *big gasp*
[1:15:03] <%cade_calrayn> Alexander = Pot Boi
[1:15:06] <penitentpendant> @hewlettfan96 Kefka?
[1:15:07] <%cade_calrayn> You've found him
[1:15:11] <+tizziks> Alexander is big boy boy
[1:15:12] <lockhead45> better than bloodbourne?
[1:15:14] <kazadog> alexander = best boi
[1:15:14] <rudiciuscaesar> idk, Bloodborne's story sings to me more directly but I'm a fucking weirdo.
[1:15:14] <%epide> pat alex is the pot
[1:15:17] <%cade_calrayn> But for some reason he's not here where he should be
[1:15:20] <+HyTricksy> siegjar
[1:15:20] <jubejube56> Oh are those the cliffs around where you first teleported to the beast clergyman?
[1:15:24] <%Kevlar_Caviar> IMO the only thing that BB does better than ER is the boss themes, there's plenty of good shit in this game but nothing comes close to BB's boss themes
[1:15:39] <+anoldtoilet> imo this is the best from soft game but im a "more is more" kind of guy
[1:15:42] <%hewlettfan96> @penitentpendant I’m sorry who is that? Why are they so evil?
[1:15:45] <%Brassnarwhal> did you find Alex Trebek's unquiet bones yet?
[1:15:45] <penitentpendant> @hewlettfan96 Though he got an 'end' not a 'torturous end' I suppose.
[1:15:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> @cade_calrayn he leaves from here at some point, I don't think you miss anything
[1:15:46] <+fyreba113r> On the map this cave looks like an entrance to nokron, big letdown
[1:15:47] <+alphonseisbest> dang that's some Recently bias huh LUL
[1:15:52] <+anoldtoilet> bloodborne and sekiro are definitely more focused but this has ALL KINDS OF SHIT
[1:15:53] <rudiciuscaesar> oh he has Gaping Dragon hit boxes?
[1:15:53] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> It always makes me smile when Pat does the thing Im screaming at my screen lol
[1:15:55] <TheHotStuven> That's a rathian hitbox if ive ever seen one
[1:15:56] <modsformeandyou> Bloodborne does bosses better in general imo
[1:16:00] <kinkade_77> lava dragon best dragon
[1:16:09] <KasiCrafter> yo get the tail break pat
[1:16:13] <jbrachob> thats some gaping dragon bullshit right thar
[1:16:17] <Sunstalker> Ahah, I just found Alexander the pot in a cave, he was lost; LUL this fkn Siegmeier
[1:16:18] <XxMoliciousxX> if you quit now?? you're not even XXXX% complete
[1:16:18] <%Valdorick> Yeyeyeye fuck 'em up!
[1:16:22] <+gag5y> centipede dragon with rtx on
[1:16:25] <+anoldtoilet> sekiro had some of my favorite bosses and fights in any of these games its a shame the translation was so badf
[1:16:25] <+gag5y> demon
[1:16:27] <+gag5y> fuck
[1:16:28] <%hewlettfan96> Damn this game is beauuutiful
[1:16:30] <+spottedwolf10> Is this a teostra?
[1:16:33] <kazadog> @hewlettfan96 kefka is the main antagonist from ff6
[1:16:36] <%Axellogic> I find combining bleed with frost does more damage overall
[1:16:36] <%PrimalDweeb> Wow, he spammin.
[1:16:40] <+gag5y> @hewlettfan96 you're beautiful
[1:16:41] <%Valdorick> It did twice the damage of your sword swing
[1:16:47] <Ner234> Does this game have tail cuts like the old games?
[1:16:52] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> This one seems stronger
[1:16:53] <+anoldtoilet> damn thats a lot of lava
[1:16:53] <Maids4lyfe> is this just Laurence the First Vicar
[1:16:56] <+anoldtoilet> get this guy a tums
[1:16:57] <%Valdorick> It does not
[1:17:00] <rudiciuscaesar> are dragons weak to lightning in this universe, like in DS
[1:17:01] <kinkade_77> the amount of bosses in this game is crazy
[1:17:02] <%greasypete00> when i fought this guy oleg died nearly immediately
[1:17:02] <%hewlettfan96> Jesus it’s better than Bloodborne AND dark souls 3 this sounds like the greatest fantasy game ever
[1:17:03] <%boggsz12> the interesting thing about this one is that the main story bosses are all fucking ridiculous and have incredible designs. like, Godrick is super cool and he's the least interesting of the shardbearers.
[1:17:04] <%Valdorick> GG!
[1:17:04] <MaybeFalco> nice
[1:17:05] <jubejube56> Friggen tigrex

[1:18:06] <+Shimano232> I think that sword is gonna get nerfed, i've been using it for most of my run and it is HILARIOUSLY strong.
[1:18:06] <$MattyNezz> YU
[1:18:12] <kazadog> dual flails is pretty hilarious for bleed
[1:18:15] <MaybeFalco> alexander is the pot guy thats in north stormhill, once you knock him out he appears at the end of that mine, which is why i assume the grace is there
[1:18:16] <%furiousfurioso> you should check out its weapon art
[1:18:23] <kinkade_77> int always gets the best weapons
[1:18:23] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> So you can have a Katana in one hand and a Uchi in the other?

[1:18:55] <+anoldtoilet> you can do a lot of this game in whatever order
[1:18:55] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I know, I'm just asking what it _would_ do if someone could use it, in general
[1:18:57] <%Valdorick> Note that Gael Tunnel has 2 entrances. The Limgrove one does not allow full access to the cave.
[1:19:05] <%hewlettfan96> Is this the best fantasy RPG ever Pat?? Considering it’s better than Bloodborne???
[1:19:05] <+Shimano232> Is there another night spawn at that church? I got one at the church of vows but not there.

[1:19:41] <+null_the_exhero> Yes
[1:19:42] <it_came_from_outer_space> probably
[1:19:42] <Zourath> @mrtanaka111 Yes. There's also crimson rot, which is better poison. It's much rarer though.

[1:19:56] <%Valdorick> Be a smart man, Pat
[1:19:58] <modsformeandyou> 17% is probably the trophy percentage, not actual completion

[1:20:01] <MaybeFalco> nvm its erudition
[1:20:02] <mrtanaka111> goofy

[1:23:58] <rudiciuscaesar> for a second, I thought the bear was non-hostile lmao
[1:24:08] <%Valdorick> These bears are basically bosses
[1:24:11] <+NeonFishFace> nah, says the bear
[1:24:15] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> AMC is charging people more to see the Batman
[1:24:16] <AlexJacobVO> Those bears do not fuck around...
[1:24:18] <adithehella> why is this bear so angry
[1:24:22] <+anoldtoilet> thats a pretty angry looking bear.
[1:24:27] <%elwrathh> that bears arms are very uncomfortable in motion

[1:24:43] <%Bluwizard21> the golem archers are down the other path
[1:24:45] <AlexJacobVO> This bear is basically me when someone wakes me up after a nap...
[1:24:45] <penitentpendant> Dear magicians: Please stop breed unstoppable super bears. Signed, everyone
[1:24:48] <jubejube56> Wasn’t it like rune bear one way, archers the other way?

[1:25:18] <+AngriestAngryArtist> bear's hitbox is so bullshit lol
[1:25:19] <rudiciuscaesar> gotta tag in Oleg
[1:25:19] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Guardian Ape animations put to good use
[1:25:20] <+Deadlymuffin5> The same enemy can be scaled differently based on the area.
[1:25:23] <rudiciuscaesar> or use Torrent
[1:25:24] <%Saadi90> Dog
[1:25:25] <$vehementvadr> this bear went through 17 anime arcs, it's practically unstoppable
[1:25:26] <%Brassnarwhal> it seems like you always need to roll past the bear, it's reach makes rolling backwards very dangerous
[1:25:34] <Ner234> Everything in Caelid is just roided out
[1:25:40] <%fyreba113r> Vordt easier than that bear lmao
[1:25:54] <+pabloelenano2> if you pay atention his fur is messed up and is longer than the ones in the other forest
[1:26:01] <AlexJacobVO> Guardian Spirit Bear don't fuck with that lightning

[1:26:28] <+The_EL_Destino> best way to defeat the bear is to give it honey

[1:26:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> get in it's pouch
[1:26:37] <mrtanaka111> the bear is the elden ring

[1:27:27] <%Pookiedaexzile> This Bear is out footsieing you

[1:27:30] <rudiciuscaesar> That was almost Hugo's ultra 2
[1:27:30] <$realm_forge> This bear is going to show up as the final boss with an eyepatch and a set of boxing gloves
[1:27:33] <%gag5y> they may be strong but so are you pathaniel!
[1:27:46] <+anoldtoilet> yeah lol every enemy in this game is a king of fighters character. they all have ranged attacks and command grabs
[1:27:49] <%PrimalDweeb> Drop onto the big crystal past the bear, you'll survive.
[1:27:51] <%ashenfrenzy> ashenfrenzy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 49 months! 
[1:27:51] <%Brassnarwhal> he's either unique or the enemy scaling curve is incredibly sharp

[1:28:15] <Sunstalker> They just gave it a unique texture cuz it's in this hellscape area
[1:28:19] <penitentpendant> Just an normal, respawning, super bear. Nothing to see here.
[1:28:19] <mrtanaka111> maidenless bear
[1:28:19] <%gag5y> boy that fight was UNBEARABLE
[1:28:24] <Happydisaster> They don’t usually have black fur, right?
[1:28:31] <$vehementvadr> because I'm getting major Florida vibes from here

[1:28:36] <kinkade_77> crazy normal ass enemies can be so strong
[1:28:38] <AlexJacobVO> Those bears in D&D would be a Monk, Barbarian, Fighter multiclass. Never stop attacking and never take damage
[1:28:40] <dashmatt> what type of bear shits gold?
[1:28:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> nothing was gained
[1:28:41] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i kept trying to find the entrance and never found it

[1:28:44] <%Brassnarwhal> @happydisaster they usually have shorter fur with markings
[1:28:51] <%JoshManVGH> A good fuck with you bear
[1:28:57] <eleskei> if bloodborne is vampire goth what is elden ring
[1:28:58] <KasiCrafter> Skillcheck bear
[1:29:03] <penitentpendant> With the irony being, the best way to deal with the bear is to run past it.
[1:29:14] <%PrimalDweeb> Makes sense
[1:29:15] <penitentpendant> Yay Vig!

[1:54:25] <+GallowsDrop> god everything in this zone looks miserable
[1:54:32] <ebrion> I only know Naruto from the SBFP LP
[1:54:33] <%Bluwizard21> I like how the soldiers and knights have different colors and standards based on the armies they are from
[1:54:38] <%Nobrev> yeah the enemy variety is pretty good
[1:54:40] <+hoenhime344> THATS a cool sheild
[1:54:42] <+Nomenanza> they are essentially colour coded.
[1:54:44] <TheAntiNihilist> but Naruto doesn't have any lions...
[1:54:49] <+REDtheBEAST> Now that a sheild i want to get
[1:54:54] <%greasypete00> i was kinda worried when i went to an area that wasnt limgrave and saw same enemies with different colours but they do it ok here
[1:54:59] <plaguedoctor_vi> they are from different faction essecially
[1:55:02] <+tizziks> Is that a giant head?
[1:55:07] <%PrimalDweeb> You should go there
[1:55:10] <mrtanaka111> we going to church tonight
[1:55:12] <it_came_from_outer_space> chest?
[1:55:13] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Get ready for the most anime battle in anime battles for a dark souls game
[1:55:13] <%Valdorick> @TheAntiNihilist Its Plato's Naruto; the *idea* of Naruto, as a Lion.
[1:55:13] <+Grayhammatter> indeed it is
[1:55:15] <Zeif00> An unprecedented level of detail
[1:55:15] <it_came_from_outer_space> did he open that
[1:55:16] <pi_in_the_sci> chest
[1:55:16] <Gorgs7> missed chest
[1:55:18] <peachy996> It's in your hands Jerry

[1:55:20] <+orochiblood> everyone rocking the Carian armor
[1:55:21] <deviljhojho_> place is a hellhole
[1:55:21] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Oh yeah, Blaidd's part of ranni's questline was to do radahn's fetival, wasn't it?
[1:55:22] <razz_zie> CHEST
[1:55:22] <Explodincatz> chest

[1:55:26] <AlexJacobVO> but where's the stable? Did they open the door? Did they see all the people?
[1:55:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> lots of giant corpses
[1:55:26] <%Nobrev> was there a chest there or was I seeing things
[1:55:27] <%vexion_smh> SHITS FUCKED
[1:55:27] <kinkade_77> aloottt of fungus
[1:55:28] <%SveriSageAdvice> you'll want to take care of stuff downstairs first
[1:55:29] <ape_hawk> do we know what caused the scarlet rot?
[1:55:30] <rudiciuscaesar> real estate prices must be fine here
[1:55:31] <+Grayhammatter> yeah, it's a hellhole
[1:55:32] <+Jeshk0> that tree looks alright tho
[1:55:32] <$scholarlypotato> Ghosts bitching for all eternity
[1:55:32] <%elwrathh> depression +8
[1:55:33] <eleskei> its one big fungal infection
[1:55:45] <+anoldtoilet> i like that they did the one piece thing of "two people fighting transformed a landscape like a nuclear war" thing
[1:55:45] <TheAntiNihilist> @valdorick lol duh fuck
[1:55:46] <kinkade_77> pretty good
[1:55:46] <Happydisaster> Yah missed a chest to your right
[1:55:50] <%Niney_Who> It's the guy who BEAT SPACE
[1:55:50] <dashmatt> looks like a heavy metal album cover from the 80s out here
[1:55:53] <%greasypete00> radahn is so cool
[1:55:55] <deviljhojho_> he actually fucked up the stars themselves
[1:55:55] <%epide> oh and pat if u find dubles of those it adds plus 1
[1:55:56] <+alphonseisbest> his dick so big
[1:55:58] <+crocodile_t34rz> Did they fight aliens?
[1:55:59] <+Akizea> hes so FUCKING COOL
[1:55:59] <mrtanaka111> hoe the fuck he did that
[1:56:01] <+alphonseisbest> he fucked the STARS
[1:56:01] <%delilah4you> Dont forget HE FOUGHT SPACE AND WON
[1:56:05] <KasiCrafter> Fought space AND WON
[1:56:07] <+Grayhammatter> how do you crush a star?
[1:56:10] <%crimsonharvest> these feel very like Terraria's accessories to me, some of them
[1:56:12] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt If you find a teleporter in Gael it will take you straight to the boss's area, just so you know
[1:56:12] <%Valdorick> @TheAntiNihilist If he fights the lion, you'll understand.
[1:56:13] <Midnight188> extraZoey
[1:56:20] <+Grayhammatter> how do you fight space and win?
[1:56:22] <%Niney_Who> Crab crab crab
[1:56:24] <+alphonseisbest> HE FUCKED UP SPACE LIKE THE BITCH IT IS
[1:56:25] <Happydisaster> Radha s so badass
[1:56:25] <%scaryboisupreme> this dude cockslaps stars like baseballs
[1:56:29] <%JoshManVGH> Man, NG+ is going to be a WILD ride in this game!
[1:56:29] <anAngryHamster> My brain is broken. When I heard center I thought of the Emperor Palpatine Surgical Reconstruction Center
[1:56:31] <+hoenhime344> @greasypete00 really, almost every enemy is reused from past games.  they re sized re skinned and gave them different weapons, but essentially, 80ish% of the enemys we have seen before
[1:56:33] <%greasypete00> not arena
[1:56:34] <fierysnowflakes> So this Ravahn guy was strong enough to fight SPACE, but couldn't fight toxic goo?
[1:56:35] <%Rbeatononefour> kimi wa kikoeru~
[1:56:38] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt thats not correct, it takes you to the castle
[1:56:40] <%Niney_Who> Yes
[1:56:40] <%spitelite> is space paiges final boss
[1:56:42] <deviljhojho_> oh yeah
[1:56:42] <%scaryboisupreme> NO HE'S SO COOL
[1:56:43] <%Kevlar_Caviar> YEP
[1:56:43] <MaybeFalco> IT REALLY IS
[1:56:44] <+Resderp> HE IS
[1:56:44] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah
[1:56:45] <%VictorVonLouche> Its insane
[1:56:45] <%delilah4you> Its the fucking best
[1:56:45] <+Resderp> I JUST GOT HERE
[1:56:46] <deviljhojho_> very pretty tho
[1:56:46] <mrtanaka111> hes GREAT
[1:56:47] <Louie_Salmon> Oh it's fucked
[1:56:47] <+Nomenanza> Radahn is actually awful mechanically yeah
[1:56:48] <%delilah4you> He's the fucking best
[1:56:48] <+Resderp> and I hate it
[1:56:48] <$MinoMiushi> Radahn is a pushover
[1:56:49] <penitentpendant> He a trip
[1:56:49] <%AllyBeeBoo> yup
[1:56:49] <%SpontaneousC> More bullshit than Orphan?
[1:56:50] <+alphonseisbest> yes, AND IT DOPE
[1:56:50] <%Bluwizard21> He really is, its very bed of chaos
[1:56:51] <+thickshield> nah man, its sick
[1:56:52] <%cade_calrayn> It does indeed look bullshit
[1:56:52] <%nanaki_ff14> ITS SOOO COOOL THO
[1:56:52] <casualbaloth> he is but it's cool
[1:56:53] <%ReenMan350> it kinda is. but it is quite neat
[1:56:53] <saraizarai> IT'S AMAZING
[1:56:53] <+MaddogRasta> I loved it
[1:56:54] <Manwad> he's fucking rad
[1:56:55] <%Niney_Who> It's cool but also complete bullshit
[1:56:56] <+Deosier> I keep autocorrecting his name to Raubahn
[1:56:57] <%Texeu> Its amazing!
[1:56:57] <+jennyfurific> He's cool but its so broken and awful
[1:56:58] <+Nomenanza> Radahn is a spectacle over function
[1:56:59] <%Reaped_Psyche> Radhan is the best and worst thing in this game
[1:56:59] <knotsundownsyndrome> radahn is fucked up, and there's a boss much more fucked up lol
[1:56:59] <%PrimalDweeb> Brilliant...
[1:57:00] <+orochiblood> cool visually but its awful
[1:57:00] <BelchinBuckaroo> Pat, IÄm good at souls games, I never take more than 20 attempts usually
[1:57:00] <darce_avidson> oh no trust me
[1:57:01] <Wakerz140> He's tough but the fight's so fucking cool.
[1:57:02] <Firststrike_OW> its really solid
[1:57:03] <%JoshManVGH> It's pretty fucking something that's for sure
[1:57:03] <%Kevlar_Caviar> he's cool but holy fuck i don't like his fight
[1:57:03] <CH3F015> nope it's fuckin cool
[1:57:04] <Sunstalker> He is not?
[1:57:04] <%nanaki_ff14> Took me 3 hours to beat it worth it
[1:57:04] <darce_avidson> i have found worse
[1:57:05] <BelchinBuckaroo> Radhan took me 100 TIMES
[1:57:05] <peachy996> Sounds good
[1:57:06] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> one of the sickests fights in concept
[1:57:06] <Midnight188> Radhan is weak to magic and fire
[1:57:07] <%Saadi90> It was great!
[1:57:08] <Ekaelis> 10/10 spectacle, 1/10 mechanics
[1:57:08] <$MinoMiushi> Radahn is maybe the 2nd or 3rd weakest major boss, he's just super cool
[1:57:08] <%scaryboisupreme> "Optional"
[1:57:09] <deviljhojho_> i've heard you can cheese it but it aint easy
[1:57:09] <Louie_Salmon> It is exactly as cool as it is ridiculous
[1:57:09] <Boombay1213> he is also one of the strongest character lore wise
[1:57:09] <Rojahh> @PatStaresAt fought him today and HE'S BS!!
[1:57:10] <+Shimano232> I personally wouldn't say bullshit, but they have never made a fight quite like it in my opinion.
[1:57:11] <%AllyBeeBoo> he's optional??
[1:57:13] <%delilah4you> you havent seen it yet, its a fuck
[1:57:16] <%ReugaLive> its a fight
[1:57:17] <darce_avidson> @knotsundownsyndrome hp sucker boss?
[1:57:17] <+ScrapKingKeita> Apparently he just crumbles to magic
[1:57:18] <+Nomenanza> Wouldnt say Radahn is optional
[1:57:18] <Sunstalker> Radahn's mandatory, no?
[1:57:19] <Ekaelis> He's like Midir but awful
[1:57:21] <%delilah4you> but its also FUCKING COOL
[1:57:21] <@Fuggins4U> WHERE'S THAT REFEREE
[1:57:23] <MaybeFalco> its optional to complete the game yes
[1:57:24] <kinkade_77> ludwig is still the most bs boss
[1:57:24] <+orochiblood> he is not optional i dont think
[1:57:24] <+REDtheBEAST> wait what!?
[1:57:25] <ebrion> But restarting the stars is a story thing
[1:57:26] <+Resderp> He's mandatory
[1:57:26] <+hoenhime344> mimic?
[1:57:29] <+hoenhime344> damn
[1:57:30] <%delilah4you> That ref tried to fuck on me!
[1:57:31] <%tetraes> Radahn isnt hard hard just wonky
[1:57:32] <%delilah4you> KATAR!
[1:57:34] <+anoldtoilet> can you not infect him with scarlet rot
[1:57:35] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> yyyoooooooooooooooooo
[1:57:39] <zevenmillion> has there been any mimics yet?
[1:57:39] <knotsundownsyndrome> @knotsundownsyndrome the super secret area boss
[1:57:39] <%boggsz12> I've also seen multiple people fight him underleveled as shit then complain about being instakilled
[1:57:39] <$MinoMiushi> Radahn was easily beaten with a greatsword and a horse /shrug
[1:57:40] <GojiGoro> still haven't touched Sekiro after the Demon of Hatred
[1:57:40] <vVAstrAVv> his own gimmick makes timing dodges bullshit
[1:57:41] <%TheGuesty> Voldo
[1:57:46] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> theres a katar in this game
[1:57:47] <peachy996> Ooh
[1:57:47] <%greasypete00> @greasypete00 i meant specifically the soldier enemies but youre right, someone in here called it "asset upcycling"
[1:57:48] <deviljhojho_> you gonna kill that naruto or what
[1:57:50] <$drabberfaun535> hes hard but easy to learn and body
[1:57:51] <%VictorVonLouche> Starting to think there are ZERO mimic chests in this game.
[1:57:53] <knotsundownsyndrome> that boss surpassed the orphan of kos
[1:57:53] <AthenaAegis> "Where's that mimic? He tried to fuck on me!" Kappa
[1:57:54] <+Nomenanza> Melee in this game overall feels much inferior to magic funnily enough
[1:57:57] <%AllyBeeBoo> is he actually optional or is Pat wrong?
[1:57:57] <%Valdorick> Try being a COWARD
[1:58:00] <%Bluwizard21> poor ninja lion
[1:58:01] <%JoshManVGH> I haven't seen any baller fist moves yet.
[1:58:02] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> Mimic where are you
[1:58:04] <peachy996> Are you a cool Voldo with Katar or are you a boring Rain from MK11
[1:58:05] <Ekaelis> Radahn theme is amazing, but the fight itself is too loud and short to appreciate it
[1:58:05] <%Brassnarwhal> restarting the stars is a part of the rinola quest line which is not the main quest line
[1:58:07] <+jacksawjack> Default Voldo Mitt
[1:58:08] <vVAstrAVv> but blead fucks radahn up
[1:58:10] <knotsundownsyndrome> @AllyBeeBoo yes he is optional
[1:58:11] <%Pookiedaexzile> Cats can Jump
[1:58:15] <AlexJacobVO> Watch it jump to his platform and kill him hahaha
[1:58:16] <%elwrathh> try lion barrage
[1:58:19] <+Nomenanza> @VictorVonLouche that's what they want you to think before introducing them
[1:58:19] <knotsundownsyndrome> in fact there are extremely few bosses that aren't
[1:58:26] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pussy No Balls. Go down there so I know why you call it Naruto lion
[1:58:37] <it_came_from_outer_space> lmao
[1:58:39] <+Resderp> @AllyBeeBoo The story made it seem like he's mandatory
[1:58:40] <Happydisaster> You don’t have to fight him, just need to runes, right?
[1:58:44] <%PrimalDweeb> Das a cool kat
[1:58:44] <+Deadlymuffin5> Summon Oleg
[1:58:45] <%Bluwizard21> Working through rannis quest and hitting radahn at low level is literally impossible, I don't think there will be low level runs of this game like pat said
[1:58:47] <peachy996> he jumpin
[1:58:49] <+Grayhammatter> lol. lmao
[1:58:53] <%greasypete00> send oleg after him
[1:58:54] <%TheGuesty> wow he bullshit fayst!
[1:58:54] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> Fuck u then
[1:59:02] <+Nomenanza> you can bait it to aggro to you in that small room you found katar in and it wont be able to dodge the poison shots
[1:59:05] <MaybeFalco> @Happydisaster you have to kill him to get access to the rune
[1:59:07] <AthenaAegis> Blade Lion!
[1:59:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LION O
[1:59:21] <AlexJacobVO> Beasts in this game seem insane
[1:59:24] <+hoenhime344> this is the lion from niho
[1:59:35] <+Mr_Misanthropy> Van  go Lion has seen better days
[1:59:38] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> Stop killing the local wildlife
[1:59:42] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Oh I remember this guy
[1:59:46] <DestroPrime83> This looks like a Final Fantasy monster
[1:59:49] <%elwrathh> lot of animals with swords strapped to them
[1:59:50] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @MaybeFalco you don't need ALL of the runes to beat the game, just most of them
[1:59:51] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Isn't it nice that despite this lion having more health that the first, you get to see how much your character has improved with how easily your dealing with it?
[1:59:51] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> This is more Chipp Lion Pat. I'm Just saying
[1:59:52] <BelchinBuckaroo> Pat, Radhan is mandatory for Ranni questline
[1:59:58] <mrtanaka111> who gave that lion a knife?
[1:59:59] <IminyourBase> why is X animal + Knife always so fucking cool?
[2:00:02] <%greasypete00> lever is up
[2:00:06] <MaybeFalco> lever above the door
[2:00:06] <eleskei> that bear seemed harder than this lion
[2:00:07] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> arty flip
[2:00:07] <Sunstalker> You did'tt earn a Poison Weapon Art yet, Pat?
[2:00:08] <%Valdorick> That's a rad ash.
[2:00:09] <Happydisaster> @maybefalco Yeah, but their are 4 other runes, meaning you dont need to fight him
[2:00:09] <%SveriSageAdvice> unfortunately no lever
[2:00:10] <AlexJacobVO> psaDab
[2:00:12] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I saw no Shadow Clones
[2:00:14] <thebestesttrashpanda> i love that you can put the artorias flip on the greatsword lol
[2:00:14] <dashmatt> Fantastic Beasts and where to fell them
[2:00:21] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> No
[2:00:22] <DestroPrime83> Try level, But hole
[2:00:29] <+jacksawjack> Poison Mist is in a Scarab in the center of the Scarlet Rot Swamp
[2:00:32] <knotsundownsyndrome> @Kevlar_Caviar you don't even need all of them, you can get through only ever killing one runebearer who's required to kill anyway
[2:00:33] <sirrice77> @BelchinBuckaroo and sellens and maybe fias
[2:00:36] <luciluxlu0> this game is so much that i am actively starting to believe that it doesn't end.
[2:00:39] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> The lion is behind you
[2:00:43] <Sunstalker> Uh, there's a nightrider at the road that goes below the rot swamp
[2:00:49] <+Nomenanza> it kinda eh but has good hyper armour on startup
[2:00:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat Ive been using the Scarlet Rot Dragon Breath, it broken AF especially combined with Bleed Weapons even against bosses
[2:00:58] <Sunstalker> Other side, jump across from stairs
[2:01:03] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah, the big knights of this area use that claymore skill, Pat
[2:01:05] <knotsundownsyndrome> the ultra critpath of the game is like, five bosses i think
[2:01:06] <%crimsonharvest> its on the plank over the door
[2:01:06] <%greasypete00> lever is above the door, you have to jump to it
[2:01:07] <knotsundownsyndrome> maybe six
[2:01:10] <+tizziks> Lever above the door
[2:01:23] <%Brassnarwhal> is it an Artorias flip
[2:01:23] <BelchinBuckaroo> @sirrice77 Yup.  Did he not revive Sellen yet?
[2:01:39] <%greasypete00> yeah
[2:01:40] <+Nomenanza> ye
[2:01:41] <%Niney_Who> Get the Crab
[2:01:41] <%Kevlar_Caviar> sure

[2:01:42] <it_came_from_outer_space> sure why not
[2:01:42] <MaybeFalco> do it
[2:01:44] <%VictorVonLouche> yeah
[2:01:46] <+Nomenanza> not arena
[2:01:46] <%crimsonharvest> might as well what're you gonna lose
[2:01:47] <IminyourBase> funnels!
[2:01:47] <+alphonseisbest> WHY NOT

[2:01:47] <casualbaloth> yes
[2:01:47] <%elwrathh> yis
[2:01:49] <+Grayhammatter> sure
[2:01:49] <MaybeFalco> not the arena, the area
[2:01:50] <%ReenMan350> no
[2:01:50] <%Kevlar_Caviar> it takes you to OUTSIDE the arena
[2:01:51] <%SveriSageAdvice> it takes you to the castle up to the arena
[2:01:51] <%VictorVonLouche> Nah outside
[2:01:52] <BelchinBuckaroo> No you need to run to it
[2:01:54] <vVAstrAVv> do it no balls
[2:01:54] <Sunstalker> No it brings you close
[2:01:55] <ape_hawk> take the port
[2:01:55] <sirrice77> No just to the castle
[2:01:55] <%cade_calrayn> It takes you to the castle
[2:01:55] <%greasypete00> it takes you to his castle
[2:01:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> area not arena
[2:01:56] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> It’s good to know those railings just explode
[2:01:56] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt No you get to choose.
[2:01:57] <%cade_calrayn> That's all
[2:01:58] <Wakerz140> IT does not take you to the boss
[2:01:59] <+Nomenanza> it takes you to boss's level
[2:02:02] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt It's fine for you to take
[2:02:02] <senfood> Give it a shot. Couldn't hurt.
[2:02:03] <+Nomenanza> you still have to get to arena
[2:02:03] <jnexgen717> yess
[2:02:05] <%VictorVonLouche> Takes you to the general location
[2:02:12] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> No Balls Looks At
[2:02:14] <TheAntiNihilist> yeyeyeye
[2:02:15] <%Bluwizard21> Radahn is a huge starcrushing fuckboi just so you know
[2:02:15] <kingra> Pat never has balls
[2:02:16] <%robotoken> Hey Pat do you recommend this as a person's first souls game?
[2:02:19] <knotsundownsyndrome> how glad are you that fall damage is a non-issue
[2:02:24] <%SveriSageAdvice> wait how did Pat get that open, i thought there was no lever
[2:02:30] <deviljhojho_> is he gonna do radahn?
[2:02:34] <deviljhojho_> could be a shitshow
[2:02:40] <MaybeFalco> its like the transporter you find that takes you to directly in front of the academy
[2:02:49] <+Nomenanza> this game actually made me use prism stones to check heights. It's kinda great
[2:02:54] <BelchinBuckaroo> @PatStaresAt Did you ever bring back Sorcerer Sellen? Need her for Ranni questline
[2:02:55] <%ScreamLord> And there's a cat ring equivilant that negates ALL fall damage
[2:02:59] <BelchinBuckaroo> Before you fight Radhan
[2:03:00] <%chitinoir> time for hole
[2:03:00] <sirrice77> @BelchinBuckaroo i remember he borked the quest by hitting imprisoned sellen and then i think he got absolution but thats it. he hasn't found azur either
[2:03:02] <deviljhojho_> its like arizona
[2:03:05] <%scaryboisupreme> this makes it so that the approach to the general's fort isn't a complete shit show
[2:03:06] <kingmemelord97> !uptime
[2:03:07] <@Moobot> @kingmemelord97 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 3m.
[2:03:10] <knotsundownsyndrome> took me a while to realize but caelid is just one big constant berserk eclipse
[2:03:13] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I feel they should have a specific color for completed areas or a star next to them so you know you got everything in them
[2:03:14] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> GO IN
[2:03:29] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt No Take that teleporter
[2:03:30] <+Shimano232> other side of the bridge
[2:03:31] <BelchinBuckaroo> Take that portal
[2:03:31] <%VictorVonLouche> Over the bridge
[2:03:32] <+Nomenanza> grace is behind you over the bridge
[2:03:33] <%scaryboisupreme> actually no
[2:03:34] <TheAntiNihilist> HERE WE GOOO
[2:03:35] <MaybeFalco> other side of the bridge
[2:03:36] <mrtanaka111> just go for it
[2:03:36] <BelchinBuckaroo> If you want to go to boss
[2:03:38] <luciluxlu0> this place gave me the creeps
[2:03:38] <%delilah4you> Its behind you
[2:03:39] <Louie_Salmon> That sure is an assumption
[2:03:40] <%delilah4you> Yeah you got it
[2:03:41] <jnexgen717> your right haha
[2:03:45] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @PatStaresAt if you go back there's also a portal that skips this whole dungeon and goes right to outside the boss arena
[2:03:46] <Wakerz140> careful about the bridge
[2:03:49] <%scaryboisupreme> oh god i hope it doesn't spawn everyone
[2:03:50] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> Feel like a dream worms about to pop up and kill you
[2:03:51] <deviljhojho_> bet the water is fucked up too
[2:03:55] <%delilah4you> He says, with burnt corpses all around him
[2:04:00] <+Nomenanza> oh right everyone is dead
[2:04:02] <%VictorVonLouche> Yeah the rot seems to just stick to ground not water
[2:04:06] <%delilah4you> Bet the water tastes like code red
[2:04:08] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Take that teleporter next to the bridge to save yourself like 30 seconds of running to the festival
[2:04:09] <%chitinoir> 'this isnt so bad' he says, riding across a bridge strewn with bones
[2:04:10] <$scholarlypotato> palisades are worthless when horses have double jump
[2:04:10] <TheAntiNihilist> lol
[2:04:11] <%VictorVonLouche> take that teleport there
[2:04:13] <binku_muja_> i half expect a world state where the sea is just red with blood.
[2:04:15] <Sunstalker> Talisman, up the wood tower
[2:04:17] <scrumbotime> fire keeps it out
[2:04:18] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Not YET
[2:04:20] <IminyourBase> perhaps its the salt in the air
[2:04:23] <%greasypete00> because radahn beat the rot to a pulp
[2:04:23] <+ShadowRFox> or they burnt the rot away completely
[2:04:26] <luciluxlu0> there kinda isn't a dungeon yet
[2:04:27] <%delilah4you> Do you think the water tastes like Code Red?
[2:04:33] <%Brassnarwhal> don't drink the water in caelid
[2:04:37] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> You didnt look around though lol
[2:04:45] <BelchinBuckaroo> @PatStaresAt Don't want to backseat too much, but your missing stuff from Ranni questline I believe before this boss
[2:04:45] <Sunstalker> Well, if the festival is busy, he can do the other boss here after, no biggie
[2:04:46] <Blank9> man I had to get into this place manually
[2:04:47] <Blank9> this is bullshit
[2:04:49] <+Nomenanza> so if you go here before the festival the entire castle is full of enemies and you have to fight a different boss
[2:04:51] <%Bluwizard21> Let the festival BEGIN!
[2:04:54] <%cade_calrayn> I don't think you're supposed to be here yet
[2:04:59] <Louie_Salmon> I never saw those teleportals
[2:05:02] <Sunstalker> But now he can't pick up loot here until festival is over. And the flamberge is here
[2:05:02] <%RigmaroleHM> OoooooOOOOOOooooh
[2:05:02] <+alphonseisbest> NOPE
[2:05:04] <mrtanaka111> sinister chanting
[2:05:05] <+alphonseisbest> he's good
[2:05:08] <%Bluwizard21> this is the literal next step in the ranni line
[2:05:11] <Saltmeisterr> hello chat
[2:05:12] <%delilah4you> No you're good on the ranni quest
[2:05:13] <vVAstrAVv> its nothing

[2:05:33] <+hoenhime344> it seems like this map is going to be the same
[2:05:33] <IminyourBase> the back down is strong
[2:05:34] <+alphonseisbest> pussy no balls
[2:05:35] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> All the ranni questline was like "Yo radahn has this big cool festival, go get in that shit and kick his ass"

[2:05:46] <%greasypete00> did you intentionally ignore the grace in that castle
[2:05:51] <ARandomBlkGuy> lol there was a grace right in front of you
[2:05:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> good idea
[2:05:53] <%chitinoir> the balls went back to bed it's fine they'll be back later
[2:05:55] <Sunstalker> They're not that strong, Pat. Also you don't have to fight them, your progress was the other way
[2:05:55] <%delilah4you> Pussy Coward Balls
[2:05:55] <%Bluwizard21> Awe at least check out the boss man, its dope but bullshit
[2:05:57] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> WOW The Back Down Part 3
[2:05:58] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt you could've gone around the side of the castle
[2:06:01] <%PrimalDweeb> Fuck those things!
[2:06:04] <BelchinBuckaroo> @Hunk_Of_Dunk Yeah, I think I just missed the last VOD XD
[2:06:05] <knotsundownsyndrome> these guys are just giant shrimps
[2:06:06] <+hoenhime344> OTG
[2:06:06] <PunishedFurby> shrimp wizards return
[2:06:08] <+Nomenanza> Ranni quest kinda fucks up that fort because it just deletes a boss there. Pissed me off so much
[2:06:10] <casualbaloth> silver fish fucks
[2:06:14] <Manwad> they crawled out the swamp!
[2:06:14] <%crimsonharvest> this is why i keep my flail

[2:06:16] <+tizziks> gross doggo
[2:06:17] <%Bluwizard21> Their spear poke is bullshit. it never bounces
[2:06:18] <eleskei> everyone in this area has bad posture
[2:06:18] <mrtanaka111> no festival
[2:06:21] <%elwrathh> LUL
[2:06:23] <Khester824> they were walking their dogs
[2:06:25] <%Nekros4442> THEY GOT ROT DOGS
[2:06:25] <%delilah4you> Yeah, but fuck it that boss SUCKS
[2:06:28] <Louie_Salmon> @hoenhime344 Yeah but almost every one of those is a bonfire, not Package Delivery 3 or Hunt Quest 15
[2:06:29] <knotsundownsyndrome> it's two bosses and they're fuck off hard
[2:06:30] <%ReugaLive> not true
[2:06:36] <Sunstalker> It comes back after @PatStaresAt Its just two things you've fought before
[2:06:36] <%delilah4you> Its a beastman and crucible knight together and they can go both rot in hell
[2:06:36] <%chitinoir> caelid makes me feel like i need seven showers
[2:06:38] <+Shimano232> that's wrong, you can still fight the other boss.
[2:06:38] <sirrice77> The boss fight is two bosses you fight elsewhere at once, i dont think you get anything either but i could be wrong
[2:06:38] <Omenaire_> just two shrimp buds taking a stroll in caelid
[2:06:39] <+Nero_Cross> That's not true at all
[2:06:40] <$Jaxnos> yeah, i was super happy when that boss vanished lmao
[2:06:43] <%scaryboisupreme> yo how did pat turn off tips in loading screens
[2:06:46] <luciluxlu0> @nomenanza it comes back later
[2:06:47] <peachy996> wouldnt be fromsoft without some fucked up quests
[2:06:51] <+HaloIsA> youre not missing out, theyre repeats and just two of em
[2:06:55] <+Nomenanza> @delilah4you oh yeah that boss is awful but what pains me is that you get a weapon from it
[2:06:57] <TheAntiNihilist> if only u had horse...
[2:07:03] <+Nomenanza> @luciluxlu0 oh thank god
[2:07:05] <$Jaxnos> oh, so i'm never going back to redmane after the festival, got it LUL
[2:07:06] <%cade_calrayn> which fort? Fort Gael?
[2:07:10] <%PrimalDweeb> Grace
[2:07:11] <%delilah4you> No weapon can be worth that shiiiiiiiiiiit
[2:07:18] <%Bluwizard21> I've been watching Distortion2 playing through this watching him slowly come to realize that a All Bosses Speedrun would literally be impossible
[2:07:22] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> dark hand grab cool
[2:07:24] <%Reaped_Psyche> Big Romantic bloody fist.
[2:07:38] <%delilah4you> Yeah theres no way you can do all bosses speedrun
[2:07:40] <+wizard_of_diamonds> They're trying to catch you riding dirty. As in being sick Kappa
[2:07:42] <%delilah4you> It would take hours and hours
[2:07:46] <pi_in_the_sci> passing grace
[2:07:49] <+Shimano232> The weapon is actually pretty sick for a strength build with a bit of magic.
[2:07:50] <ebrion> Grace right?
[2:07:50] <Gorgs7> grace on the right back there
[2:07:52] <%PrimalDweeb> Missed grace
[2:08:02] <BelchinBuckaroo> YOOOOO
[2:08:02] <MaybeFalco> ROT DRAGON

[2:08:07] <%cade_calrayn> I rode right past him too
[2:08:08] <%delilah4you> FIGHT IT! GET IT! COWARD!
[2:08:08] <AlexJacobVO> RUUUUUUN
[2:08:09] <Ner234> lol that wouldn't be a "Speed"run at that point LUL

[2:08:28] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> Get em dragon
[2:08:29] <BelchinBuckaroo> He says nah
[2:08:37] <fierysnowflakes> You missed the actual grace at some point
[2:08:39] <ebrion> Grace was on the road befor the dragon
[2:08:40] <+austinj24> Oh h
[2:08:45] <MaybeFalco> there's a grace just before the dragon as well
[2:08:49] <%PrimalDweeb> You passed two graces on you way here
[2:08:53] <%Bluwizard21> Its a durgun
[2:08:55] <pi_in_the_sci> it was along the road
[2:08:58] <%delilah4you> "tarnished, why the fuck are you here, get your ass out of caelid its way too early for that shit"
[2:09:04] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt cathedral lets you get other dragon spells aside from the starting 3
[2:09:06] <+Shimano232> no options left to get
[2:09:08] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> it bugs sometimes
[2:09:08] <%Nekros4442> night time
[2:09:09] <%delilah4you> Night time
[2:09:09] <+Shimano232> so no menu

[2:09:21] <AlexJacobVO> no have itum?
[2:09:21] <+Smokebanshee> reload its bugged
[2:09:22] <Firststrike_OW> thats odd
[2:09:23] <%PrimalDweeb> That's weird
[2:09:25] <scrumbotime> maybe because the dragon is active out front?
[2:09:26] <Boombay1213> Dragon?
[2:09:27] <%delilah4you> It only works at night
[2:09:29] <Boombay1213> Are you in combat?
[2:09:30] <+Nomenanza> @greasypete00 nah no dragon killing required
[2:09:39] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> It doesn’t work for cowards

[2:10:28] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat already has Rotten Breath tho...HEYOOOOO
[2:10:29] <+Shimano232> Killing that dragon  you just saw gives scarlet breath lvl 2.
[2:10:30] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Oh wait, do named dragons unlock stronger versions of the dragon spells?
[2:10:31] <AlexJacobVO> Uh oh stinky breath
[2:10:32] <+hoenhime344> ice breath i the coolest... but PAT BECOMW ROT
[2:10:33] <+jacksawjack> Rot works on Erdtree Avatars
[2:10:35] <+austinj24> ROT
[2:10:37] <+Nomenanza> What I see here is the preview of all the power ranger dragons we can encounter
[2:10:42] <doster504> has anyone else here gotten to the final boss
[2:10:45] <%Brassnarwhal> rot sounds cool
[2:10:48] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> Doesn’t your dog know that move?
[2:10:51] <KasiCrafter> I feel like Rot Breath is SOME sort of war crime

[2:10:58] <%delilah4you> oh cool shield
[2:11:01] <%TaurusOxford> oof

[2:11:16] <luciluxlu0> use fire
[2:11:16] <%sighphers> btw, can you only use that altar once?
[2:11:20] <%cade_calrayn> the Grace is on the other side of him
[2:11:21] <%PrimalDweeb> Why does every shield but the one you're already using suck?
[2:11:22] <sirrice77> @Crinack_ Magma wyrms scalesword
[2:11:22] <%Brassnarwhal> that would make sense
[2:11:25] <dds333a> Kappa
[2:11:29] <+jacksawjack> There's a dragon worth 5 hearts to theeast
[2:11:32] <%Brassnarwhal> @sighphers you just need hearts
[2:11:34] <%Bluwizard21> do able
[2:11:36] <%delilah4you> He kills you then deletes your save
[2:11:38] <+jennyfurific> eh he's not that much harder than a regular dragon imo. his breath is just more deadly
[2:11:41] <%cade_calrayn> like the literal other side, behind the hill

[2:12:05] <%Bluwizard21> Zombie dragon
[2:12:08] <%Brassnarwhal> poison him?
[2:12:11] <luciluxlu0> actually fire works better cause it's undead

[2:12:46] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> That is D&D guiding bolt
[2:12:52] <+pectusumbra> So this is just a bloodborne zone I guess?
[2:12:53] <dds333a> Wasn't doing much, huh?
[2:12:55] <AlexJacobVO> Nevermind. They obviously got rid of DS dragons vs lightning lore
[2:12:56] <RickyRelucent> Hunter Souls has begun!
[2:12:59] <Explodincatz> damage sponge
[2:13:02] <+zaddyforever> i ended up finding a different banished knight from oleg
[2:13:04] <+pectusumbra> I'm not complaining mind you
[2:13:07] <%TaurusOxford> LUL
[2:13:09] <Scorilla> the problem isn’t his breath damage ( that’s always been a thing with dragons) the problem is its SPREAD
[2:13:10] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> Magma time?
[2:13:15] <%greasypete00> bleed perhaps?
[2:13:16] <%luftraumm1> scarlet rot is no joke

[2:13:42] <%PrimalDweeb> This is gonna be awhile, isn't it? Lmao
[2:13:43] <%Brassnarwhal> the dragon probably resists fire right?
[2:13:44] <+Figleafplays> holy shit that went up so goddamn fast
[2:13:44] <MaybeFalco> the range for that one rot attack is huge, you have to really get far to avoid it
[2:13:44] <DSD24> Is Pat a cool Wolfman now?
[2:13:52] <+austinj24> Power within?
[2:13:53] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> @ebrion LUL

[2:16:01] <+zaddyforever> frostbite is pretty decent, i bet the stamina damage kills in pvp
[2:16:14] <Ekaelis> @BallerSwagBro9k No, that would be too on the nose.
[2:16:18] <%Bluwizard21> I love how poison and rot breaths deal damage and status you up and are near impossible to avoid on foot
[2:16:18] <+pectusumbra> So has anyone confirmed if tails ARE a thing in this?
[2:16:27] <AlexJacobVO> @5Two oh my god I fucking forgot
[2:16:30] <%PrimalDweeb> You can do it Pat, we believe in you!

[2:16:59] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I haven't heard of a single actual thing come from cutting tails so I can pretty safely assume it's not a thing
[2:17:01] <%Bluwizard21> Torrent looks more like a cow when he's riding towards the screen
[2:17:06] <+Grayhammatter> wow, that bleed
[2:17:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Bleed + Scarlet Rot = Winning the Game btw

[2:21:06] <%TaurusOxford> @OboTolken Count on it.
[2:21:06] <Ner234> sigh
[2:21:08] <tanarath> Scarlet rot is like poison that hurts you as you gain even some of the status.
[2:21:09] <%Nekros4442> @obotolken the most successful game from Fromsoft.....yeah prolly
[2:21:17] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt There is a glintstone dragon you'll come across that instakills if you don't have over 1000 health
[2:21:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> We're in PAIGELAND now
[2:21:34] <%Reaped_Psyche> The disappointment on Pats face saying that made it all worth it.
[2:21:39] <penitentpendant> They really do
[2:21:47] <YeeZaurus> get big
[2:21:52] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> the raya lucaria main boss is the most fromsoft fight I've ever seen
[2:21:52] <AgnusLaplace> then maybe put some points there, pat
[2:21:53] <%fockniapo> do you level up or is the hp increase equipment based?
[2:21:54] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It feels like they want you to push fuckin' everything
[2:21:56] <%NopeBadguy> I've been putting way too many points into just Strength and I've been paying dearly for it
[2:21:58] <%scaryboisupreme> this was the area i first went to after the southern area cause the game teleported me here
[2:22:02] <%Rbeatononefour> vim & vigor, as they say
[2:22:09] <+Grayhammatter> i'd like a holy flail
[2:22:09] <%nanaki_ff14> :)
[2:22:10] <kinkade_77> str vit build is always the easiest
[2:22:14] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I just beat the game, and honestly the second half is somehow more incredible than the first
[2:22:16] <%justcallmebobplease> IS there even a BIG holy greatsword sorta thing?
[2:22:17] <%delilah4you> No but there is ANOTHER holy scythe coming up
[2:22:18] <OboTolken> I can't even begin to imagine what DLC for this game would look like
[2:22:18] <MaybeFalco> to be fair the glintstone dragon is also probably end-game, it drops something like 110k souls if i remember correctly
[2:22:19] <RickyRelucent> get pat a plaguesword
[2:22:24] <AlexJacobVO> hit and run tactics
[2:22:30] <%nanaki_ff14> Mods can we tell him about a boss in this area?
[2:22:33] <OboTolken> @BallerSwagBro9k When's the next compilation video?

[2:22:43] <+Mr_Misanthropy> what does estus flask juice taste like?

[2:22:45] <AlexJacobVO> you almost had him before doing that
[2:22:45] <%Rbeatononefour> damn
[2:22:48] <+hoenhime344> i guess if a 40 ton dragon stomps on you... you die
[2:22:49] <KasiCrafter> If Bleed is your goal, why not go for the wings which are always so low?
[2:22:52] <YeeZaurus> O_O
[2:22:53] <luciluxlu0> @patstaresat it exists but in the amber area somewhere
[2:22:53] <+vaderxyz1970> There is a holy chainsaw
[2:22:57] <tanarath> poor baby
[2:22:58] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I have found that ability scaling is 3rd to Weapon upgrade and health stamina mana upgrades

[2:26:44] <+GrooveDiva> The one time I wanted to see Pat die
[2:26:47] <Ner234> Hmm, yeah it makes sense that it just adapted to it.

[2:27:46] <sirrice77> @milhousego theres a lot of magic and it seems good but its gonna honestly take a while till you get some cool spells unless you already know where to look
[2:27:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat After the Poison I recommend buying Magic Breath, its good backup against enemies immune to Rot
[2:27:59] <+alphonseisbest> @ChrisPlaysThing FUCK YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUU :p

[2:29:55] <zhenthrim213> @mrtanaka111 its how i beat him
[2:29:57] <+donpepperoni> LUL
[2:29:59] <Sunstalker> Jeez, there's a magic golem under the caelid erdtree and it is so much hp
[2:30:00] <$milhousego> is magic good in this game, or is it kinda meh like in ds 2 and 3?
[2:30:05] <z_mad_j> nope
[2:30:08] <casualbaloth> i think the stone man is immune to disease ):
[2:30:09] <%scaryboisupreme> Pat it's made of stone
[2:30:10] <Scorilla> he's tough as hell though lol
[2:30:10] <zenith0111> Did like nothing its a statue pat
[2:30:11] <it_came_from_outer_space> this lad seems somewhat resistant
[2:30:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Hes immune i believes
[2:30:13] <Blank9> magic is ok, but faith is great
[2:30:14] <adithehella> wait that thing comes to life?
[2:30:14] <$vehementvadr> poison stone?
[2:30:19] <+Shimano232> I'm pretty sure stone doesn't get aids.
[2:30:20] <%Kevlar_Caviar> guess he's immune
[2:30:21] <+hoenhime344> hahaaha
[2:30:23] <mrtanaka111> big bird never die
[2:30:24] <+thickshield> I ... did this exact thing with the death laser spell. this guy is tough with a capital T
[2:30:24] <rosabellamelantha> he's made of stone
[2:30:24] <rudiciuscaesar> this dude....
[2:30:25] <+pectusumbra> yeah that guy was not impressed
[2:30:26] <MaybeFalco> oh you can easily
[2:30:27] <%Kevlar_Caviar> literally the worst thing to test it on LUL
[2:30:29] <+Nomenanza> he is stupid strong
[2:30:31] <%Bluwizard21> oh shit I just recognized that, that's a damn gargoyle. Fuck man I hate those things
[2:30:32] <it_came_from_outer_space> dw you have like 50 levels to go
[2:30:34] <%scaryboisupreme> Most bosses are immune to scarlet rot
[2:30:35] <tanarath> You can
[2:30:36] <ExpressNode> So I saw that fromsoft launched some updates for PC and PS5. Did you update?
[2:30:37] <%greasypete00> he probably drops something either really great or complete shit
[2:30:38] <sun312772> he's made out of stone
[2:30:39] <%SaiyanShoto> Not with that attitude
[2:30:39] <RickyRelucent> ehhh, im betting you come back here in a bit
[2:30:41] <%furiousfurioso> I mean he seems like he eats rot on the daily
[2:30:42] <Scorilla> he drops the kind of weapon you want :)
[2:30:43] <penitentpendant> That bear?
[2:30:46] <vVAstrAVv> radahn
[2:30:46] <%Kevlar_Caviar> true!
[2:30:49] <sirrice77> radahn isnt
[2:30:50] <+jacksawjack> Erdtree Avatar
[2:30:51] <+pectusumbra> did you kill that big guy you fed the flowers to?
[2:30:51] <Sunstalker> Giants in stormeil hills?
[2:30:52] <penitentpendant> The giga bear in Caelid valley?
[2:30:53] <peachy996> Immune to Halitosis
[2:30:53] <+Shimano232> the 2 narutos at redmane?
[2:30:53] <it_came_from_outer_space> the ones that arent RIP in peace
[2:30:53] <MaybeFalco> fun fact, if you go all the way in the sanctum, you can lose boss aggro entirely but the health stays the same
[2:30:57] <%Dakuu75> the rotting dragon?
[2:30:57] <mrtanaka111> like say,radahn
[2:30:58] <%Kevlar_Caviar> TEST IT ON CRAWFISH
[2:31:00] <zhenthrim213> Rahdan isnt
[2:31:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Not true I killed MANY bosses with Rot Breath
[2:31:05] <%Bluwizard21> Ogres, crabs, lobsters,
[2:31:09] <trasherxl> try it on some bear!
[2:31:11] <%greasypete00> big prawn
[2:31:11] <Saltmeisterr> CRAWDAD
[2:31:13] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Is it drawn by Plague? Kappa
[2:31:13] <Sunstalker> Oh no, not the eldritch prawn you found
[2:31:14] <AlexJacobVO> Woooooah
[2:31:14] <+jacksawjack> Cajun Gumbo Time!!!
[2:31:15] <RickyRelucent> crawfish vs covid
[2:31:16] <%chitinoir> crust da crawdads
[2:31:20] <AlexJacobVO> This area is cool
[2:31:20] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I can point you to some other dragons to try it on
[2:31:23] <%PrimalDweeb> You could try it out on that bear you were fighting earlier
[2:31:24] <%Dakuu75> wait wut?!
[2:31:26] <+Grayhammatter> those prawns are assholes
[2:31:29] <+thickshield> blast a shrimp into mushroom hell
[2:31:31] <%nanaki_ff14> I have yet to encounter a mimic
[2:31:33] <%Dakuu75> what grace was that?
[2:31:33] <+jennyfurific> SO IT WASNT JUST ME
[2:31:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Even if the bosses are immune to Rot the breath damage still hurts
[2:31:36] <+5Two> FOOKIN' PRAWNS!
[2:31:37] <+hoenhime344> lobster or prawn... cuz they are different
[2:31:40] <ExpressNode> Going to district 10
[2:31:42] <%Valdorick> By the way Pat, a reason to keep Rotten Breath instead of the Upgraded version - Rotten Breath is castable on your horse, its upgrade isn't.
[2:31:44] <Ash_Frey> prawn do you mean lobster ?
[2:31:49] <zhenthrim213> @nanaki_ff14 i just did have fun
[2:31:52] <%Nobrev> I found a basic zombie that turned into a gorilla bear
[2:31:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Not on horse
[2:31:58] <%greasypete00> ia that a man... fiighting a shrimp? YOOOOOO

[2:32:20] <RickyRelucent> i like how it incentivises pvp
[2:32:22] <+Grayhammatter> yea he did
[2:32:22] <+Shimano232> so if you have a poison weapon can you poison + scarlet rot?
[2:32:26] <+The_EL_Destino> gonna have lobster bisque
[2:32:27] <it_came_from_outer_space> very nicee
[2:32:28] <RickyRelucent> maybe it can be a red soapstone/gravelord
[2:32:29] <+hoenhime344> o he super got poisoned... ilied
[2:32:29] <rudiciuscaesar> now eat the corpse
[2:32:29] <zenith0111> At the cost of all MP it better do something
[2:32:31] <RickyRelucent> c :
[2:32:35] <%luftraumm1> THIS IS GONNA BE A PROBLEM SOLVER FOR SURE
[2:32:37] <CriscoKnight> 500 souls lmao
[2:32:37] <AthenaAegis> The power of STANK BREATH
[2:32:38] <+Grayhammatter> that's busted
[2:32:39] <sirrice77> @Shimano232 yes
[2:32:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @shimano232 sadly no
[2:32:41] <luciluxlu0> @scorilla ranni's quest line
[2:32:41] <rosabellamelantha> @Scorilla Do Ranni's quest
[2:32:43] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Shimano232 yes, you can combo any elemental thing
[2:32:44] <%Dakuu75> (probably not safe to eat that one... since you killed it with ROT)
[2:32:49] <%nanaki_ff14> just the tag wow
[2:32:52] <+hoenhime344> 20 damage a tick
[2:32:53] <%Bluwizard21> @Shimano232 yes, all of the status stack
[2:32:55] <RickyRelucent> crab..P E O P L E
[2:32:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Depends on the enemy some need 2 hits
[2:32:56] <Ash_Frey> @Scorilla yeah i think i have let me double check my map
[2:33:03] <zenith0111> WHAT
[2:33:07] <MaybeFalco> you dont even need to attack it now, just run away and it'll die on its own
[2:33:12] <eleskei> that thing could feed 40 families minmum
[2:33:18] <MidnightPacif1c> moredotsmoredotsmoredots
[2:33:19] <adithehella> what is UP with crustaceans in this game
[2:33:22] <$Teh_Un> Lucky it doesn't have a knife, you'd be screwed otherwise
[2:33:23] <+hoenhime344> o wow... thats super long
[2:33:26] <+pectusumbra> it is an expensive move though
[2:33:27] <zenith0111> Aren't lobster immune to disease
[2:33:27] <ExpressNode> Ha it died in the air
[2:33:28] <+Grayhammatter> fookin' prawns
[2:33:29] <RickyRelucent> STOP DOTS
[2:33:31] <%PrimalDweeb> Pat, your breath is stank!
[2:33:31] <+thickshield> if you guys like rot, there is a rapier in the altus region that has it... and you can slap another art of war on it to give it poison or frost or bleed...
[2:33:35] <Scorilla> ive gotten as far as retrieving the treasure and ranni falling asleep, but never got up there
[2:33:39] <huskarl_zap> where do you find the wolfman after darriwil?
[2:33:42] <MaybeFalco> yeah its right before the rot dragon
[2:33:53] <+hoenhime344> how does paige kiss you with breath like that
[2:33:54] <KasiCrafter> DOTs so hard that they become ellipses
[2:33:57] <+zaddyforever> @thickshield tell me where that is immediately
[2:33:59] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i think so?
[2:34:07] <Notsocleveruser> Hey Pat how do you feel about the hub this time around? I dont think I'm feeling it as much as Majula or DS3 Firelink
[2:34:08] <+Resderp> Dunno but there is an ash of war that does poison
[2:34:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I think so be I haven't found it
[2:34:10] <HeroToxiko> where to find
[2:34:11] <+Nomenanza> there is one that does poison so I assume there is one that does rot also
[2:34:15] <+tizziks> It's right by the road
[2:34:15] <ExpressNode> Rot build
[2:34:16] <+jacksawjack> Poison Mist is in the swamp nearby
[2:34:18] <Timbroome> Stray dog does rot
[2:34:20] <bobxmaker> i know there's a rapier that does rot
[2:34:20] <+jennyfurific> i found a bleed one so i assume theres a rot one
[2:34:21] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Maybe, probably towards that scarlet rot ladies terriotry
[2:34:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> There's a couple weapons that do rot
[2:34:30] <Ash_Frey> @Scorilla  yeah nah sorry mate, i thought i did. it has to be a teleport or something
[2:34:34] <HeroToxiko> how do you get stray dog
[2:34:34] <Sunstalker> I've found bleed, poison, fire, flame art (which is fire but scale off faith).
[2:34:37] <BelchinBuckaroo> @PatStaresAt No but there is a dagger
[2:34:38] <+hoenhime344> what your WORST take on elden ring?
[2:34:47] <+Shimano232> havvn't seen an ash of war, but i have 2 weapons with scarlet rot built in.
[2:34:48] <+null_the_exhero> Did you fight the guy in the hub>
[2:34:48] <%ChrisPlaysThing> yay me
[2:34:52] <+SaintSalted> you can inflict sleep in pvp now btw
[2:34:55] <Blank9> Did you get the 30 faith fist in the hub from jumping off the balcony to the lower floor?
[2:35:01] <+thickshield> @zaddyforever near the shaded castle, on the west side of it in fact.
[2:35:05] <Scorilla> @Ash_Frey ah thanks anyway ;-;
[2:35:09] <zenith0111> @hoenhime344 It has the worst boss design of the entire Souls series
[2:35:13] <Ash_Frey> @PatStaresAt what do you think of this berserk ass area
[2:35:16] <+SaintSalted> i got a sleep weapon and its dope
[2:35:19] <%SveriSageAdvice> do you want some easy dragon hearts and maybe a couple of levels thats in the area?
[2:35:20] <+tizziks> That giant face is creepy
[2:35:20] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Mihn spec Kappa
[2:35:28] <zenith0111> I found that fight that made me go "This is worse than bed of chaos"
[2:35:28] <KasiCrafter> They have high SKILL requirements heh
[2:35:29] <penitentpendant> It feels like mild stat gating, honestly
[2:35:30] <NewWillinium> Worst take? Combat on the Horse is funky, and it's only less so then Skyrim's because it's so much faster.  . . . Oh and that you can't cast spells from horseback. Unlike Skyrim.
[2:35:31] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt considering there are abilities that take health I figured dragon moves would have as well
[2:35:37] <eleskei> wheres that lady who invited u to her party
[2:35:38] <+hoenhime344> i wish minh streamed more
[2:35:38] <+jacksawjack> Poison Mist in the goo
[2:35:52] <it_came_from_outer_space> @NewWillinium you can cast from horse
[2:35:54] <+doe3879> was he never kidnapped to the "goo?
[2:35:57] <it_came_from_outer_space> just gotta have it in right hand
[2:35:57] <+Akizea> @NewWillinium what? you can cast spells from horseback lol your horse just slows down
[2:36:00] <ExpressNode> Its fucking huge but everything is either a mutant or dead
[2:36:03] <schiester420> it's all mold
[2:36:04] <%cade_calrayn> there's a ton of Graces along the road, you may have missed some, but you'll get them eventually
[2:36:08] <RickyRelucent> I like how they made a whole game about going to catacombs at 30
[2:36:10] <+jacksawjack> poison mist in the goo zone
[2:36:14] <kingmemelord97> nah
[2:36:15] <+SaintSalted> stats soft cap at 60 in this wtf
[2:36:19] <%SaiyanShoto> You far ahead of me so I don’t know shit
[2:36:19] <%Kevlar_Caviar> as far as i can tell there's only one boss in this game that's universally hated, which is pretty low for a fromsoft game
[2:36:25] <$drabberfaun535> do you think this game is gonna hurt dragons dogma 2?
[2:36:26] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt You left a big boss at the southern end of the continent
[2:36:26] <NewWillinium> . .Can you? I wasn't able to use my staff against the Tree Sentinel
[2:36:26] <%jamsbybetty> y'all I'm level 70 and Caelid is kicking my ass :\
[2:36:27] <%justcallmebobplease> HIS FIRST FETUS DOG!
[2:36:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BIG PUPPO
[2:36:29] <%Ne1son> ITS A TREX
[2:36:29] <huskarl_zap> dog?
[2:36:30] <jubejube56> You know the goo is calling you
[2:36:34] <NewWillinium> Only my right hand weapon
[2:36:34] <%Bluwizard21> Trex Pupper
[2:36:37] <Willowight> t rex dog?
[2:36:38] <%RonaldMcDownload> yo quiero YOUR DEATH
[2:36:38] <Jace_Keats> Dino Dog!
[2:36:40] <Ash_Frey> have you found pot guy ?
[2:36:41] <AllenDeadman> Scrappy Doo looking-ass bi-
[2:36:42] <AlexJacobVO> That's a GD mexican hairless dog
[2:36:44] <%Pookiedaexzile> Kangaroo
[2:36:46] <MaybeFalco> the goo calls
[2:36:49] <%justcallmebobplease> It's Scarlet Rotting with hunger!
[2:36:50] <%Pookiedaexzile> Drawn to scale
[2:36:51] <Ash_Frey> because he has something in this place
[2:36:52] <CriscoKnight> glowing eyes means you get 5X the amount of runes. They're random
[2:36:53] <%justcallmebobplease> That's why... maybe!
[2:36:53] <%Bluwizard21> these guys really fucking suck
[2:36:57] <+jennyfurific> red ones is stronger
[2:36:59] <+pectusumbra> alright. I was going to ask if anyone saw any bloodborne beast style moves in this but I'mma guess there's a yes to that
[2:37:02] <+stellarseeker> dom't glowy eyes mean more drops
[2:37:02] <+null_the_exhero> Red eye enemies give more runes
[2:37:02] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt if you're wondering why Redmane castle is empty apparently that just happens if you do Ranni's quest for the place until you kill the boss there, it FEELS like a bug
[2:37:03] <it_came_from_outer_space> @NewWillinium yes thats the thing, equip both staff and weapon on right hand and switch between
[2:37:07] <+jacksawjack> Poison mist scarab in the goo
[2:37:22] <Scorilla> @Ash_Frey ah. we gotta go through the lake of rot underground to get up there
[2:37:22] <NewWillinium> @it_came_from_outer_space Ahhhhhhh. . . Well that's a bit silly
[2:37:23] <RickyRelucent> the claw move, but you knew that one already
[2:37:24] <Ash_Frey> ya gonna have do this boys quest PotFriend
[2:37:25] <AlexJacobVO> BIRB!
[2:37:30] <%PrimalDweeb> LUl
[2:37:43] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Someone enabled big head mode
[2:37:47] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah, it's the Festival that Pot Boi was talking about - the place will go back to normal after Radahn is dead
[2:37:51] <it_came_from_outer_space> @NewWillinium How is it silly? you only get one arm slot because you need to steer
[2:37:51] <Blank9> Did you get the Cipher Pata weapon in the hub, from jumping off the balcony?
[2:37:51] <Ash_Frey> @Scorilla pretty much yeah, did he unearth him yet ?
[2:37:53] <zenith0111> Have you ever revisited stormveil?
[2:37:53] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> Rot!
[2:37:59] <Fabulich> birb go bonk bonk pek
[2:38:00] <+Akizea> @it_came_from_outer_space no, you can also switch hands on the horse and just use it that way
[2:38:01] <AlexJacobVO> or potentially immune due to being rotted?
[2:38:09] <+hoenhime344> when YOU STAGGER IT YOU CAN
[2:38:10] <%PrimalDweeb> That thing has legs for days
[2:38:11] <BepBepAmShep> Imagine if this crow was what picked up up at the beginning of DS1
[2:38:11] <+hoenhime344> capos
[2:38:11] <%Niney_Who> Love how that think FAKES a fall to grab you
[2:38:13] <+hoenhime344> sorry
[2:38:16] <Midnight188> he's started Ranni's questline right?
[2:38:16] <ExpressNode> It makes sense if they are immune because they live in this wasteland
[2:38:20] <Willowight> why is everything evolving into dinosaurs
[2:38:29] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> Fight a big snail
[2:38:30] <+pectusumbra> I wonder if that dragon breath wouldn't be better with some fat high poise armor style builds
[2:38:34] <NewWillinium> @it_came_from_outer_space Because you can steer with your legs or just switch hands?
[2:38:34] <+BrickhouseArsh> Does the rot breath apply rot instantly?
[2:38:36] <zhenthrim213> i took one step in here and noped the fuk out
[2:38:42] <%Kevlar_Caviar> there actually is Very Good use for rot here
[2:38:44] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt so as I was saying basically if you kill the boss the castle will go back to normal (if you talk to the NPC afterwards)
[2:38:54] <Ash_Frey> @PatStaresAt have you helped PotFriend twice yet
[2:38:59] <it_came_from_outer_space> @NewWillinium apparently you can switch hands someone just said to me
[2:39:02] <HeroToxiko> 2 tics yeah
[2:39:02] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> It’s called zangief breathe
[2:39:07] <it_came_from_outer_space> so try to figure that out i guess
[2:39:08] <jubejube56> It also said you could do it while airborne, idk if you could use it while falling
[2:39:12] <+mup420> golden seed?
[2:39:14] <zenith0111> YUP
[2:39:17] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt breath cast stack rot at like a 75-100 rate compared to a 50ish on weapons
[2:39:19] <huskarl_zap> rot ahead try fingers but hole.
[2:39:23] <zenith0111> Scarlet Rot dungeon
[2:39:28] <tanarath> You need the scarlet rot cleansing miracle
[2:39:28] <+hoenhime344> fire bleed is p good
[2:39:29] <MaybeFalco> i dont even remember doing this dungeon
[2:39:36] <+hoenhime344> better than frost lighting imo
[2:39:47] <RickyRelucent> yeyeye
[2:39:47] <%Kevlar_Caviar> YEEEEAAAAHHHH
[2:39:51] <Ner234> He was trying ok?
[2:39:52] <Blank9> it's wild how faith became the variety damage type stat now
[2:39:52] <+ZeroXI> my dude aimed for the wall
[2:39:54] <+hoenhime344> for sure that was paige
[2:39:55] <ebrion> Sacred Vow them?
[2:39:59] <RickyRelucent> try RUMP
[2:40:17] <shotgang86> man they reused a lot of layouts huh
[2:40:18] <+Grayhammatter> oh no, scarlet rot flowers?
[2:40:21] <%Dakuu75> are ALL the flowers weak to fire?
[2:40:26] <MaybeFalco> LUL
[2:40:27] <rudiciuscaesar> ARROWED
[2:40:28] <%Kevlar_Caviar> it's honestly insane how slow the scarlet rot goes down
[2:40:31] <%Brassnarwhal> cleanse
[2:40:40] <CriscoKnight> Rolling in poison goop gets you covered in it and you'll still get buildup after leaving
[2:40:46] <MaybeFalco> skeleton out here trying to be a hero
[2:40:47] <huskarl_zap> rolling makes poison and rot increase faster
[2:40:55] <+hoenhime344> .
[2:41:01] <Ash_Frey> man being a holy char seems like the best thing :( i might have to respec
[2:41:06] <RickyRelucent> damn thats fucked
[2:41:06] <it_came_from_outer_space> [4]! oleg upgrade?
[2:41:07] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> DS2 rules, get it all over your body
[2:41:08] <%Dakuu75> @huskarl_zap I didn't know. lol
[2:41:17] <it_came_from_outer_space> or was it grave glovewort
[2:41:20] <%Dakuu75> omg it was real
[2:41:21] <zenith0111> Ye the goo on your character is active and real
[2:41:21] <%SpontaneousC> Jumping also seems to make it increase faster but Im not 100% sure on that
[2:41:21] <%PrimalDweeb> Fuck
[2:41:23] <chowndawg> rolling also makes it keep building when you are out of it
[2:41:23] <%cade_calrayn> plus the proc sticks around if you roll
[2:41:23] <RickyRelucent> anybody know if theres a rusted ring because sheesh
[2:41:25] <penitentpendant> Praise the message!
[2:41:26] <TheNix> honestly shocked that one was real
[2:41:27] <+doe3879> WOW, not a lie
[2:41:28] <MaybeFalco> oh i dont remember this dungeon because i guess i never fucking did it lmao
[2:41:28] <RickyRelucent> thats steep
[2:41:29] <+hoenhime344> cheaky wall
[2:41:31] <zenith0111> Stays proccing even when out of swamp
[2:41:31] <+sambws> Trying to find the illusory walls in offline mode sucks lol
[2:41:31] <rudiciuscaesar> that is the grimmest of all grim reaperrs
[2:41:35] <%cade_calrayn> Grave = Special, Ghost = normal
[2:41:35] <WooWho> wow, a useful message for once
[2:41:43] <+justianxix> LUL
[2:41:45] <%gag5y> STEAL THE CLOUT MMMYEEEES
[2:41:45] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Running also seems to make it go up?
[2:41:46] <%Ne1son> Pat you scum
[2:41:48] <RickyRelucent> LUL
[2:41:51] <Ner234> Pat LUL wtf
[2:41:52] <+Akizea> if you roll in poison or scarlet rot it acumulates regardless of if you're standing in it or not
[2:41:52] <shotgang86> I think thats the FIRST TIME that I see a message like that tell the truth
[2:41:53] <+hoenhime344> lol i love how pat over writes all the useful messages
[2:41:56] <huskarl_zap> soap decreases poison and rot build up but won't cure it if it fills out
[2:41:57] <ExpressNode> Its me MEEEE
[2:42:00] <%Niney_Who> Have fun wit hthis boss
[2:42:03] <it_came_from_outer_space> cade isnt it the other way aaround?
[2:42:04] <KasiCrafter> You made this? I made this :)

[2:43:38] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Does this game feel similar in theme and art direction to Blasphemous to you?
[2:43:40] <Shiibbae> T H R E E S H O T

[2:49:35] <RickyRelucent> welcome to blight county
[2:49:45] <%Brassnarwhal> the dragonflies might be the most annoying of all

[2:50:45] <Ash_Frey> i hate and loved this fuck  cave
[2:50:45] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Double imp areas are generally super loots with hefty boses
[2:50:49] <AllenDeadman> wait
[2:50:58] <zenith0111> Pop a Rune Arc for more Deeps
[2:50:59] <%Dakuu75> dungeon is trying to lure you into a false sense of security. with early loot, jsut for walking in
[2:51:03] <%Brassnarwhal> can't believe that wasnt a trap
[2:51:08] <RickyRelucent> i like how they kept the same ra tmodel
[2:51:15] <schiester420> so no head???
[2:51:17] <rudiciuscaesar> dashu that rat be
[2:51:19] <%Dakuu75> there are double-imp doors?
[2:51:21] <%Bluwizard21> I thought it was a double
[2:51:24] <%Valdorick> The bottom Imp already had a key in it, yeah
[2:51:27] <pi_in_the_sci> it looked double to me
[2:51:30] <luciluxlu0> This one is worthwhile just cause the reward is cool.
[2:51:35] <%Brassnarwhal> i thought there were only double imps
[2:51:39] <Ash_Frey> @Bluwizard21 this one is hella important
[2:51:42] <AlexJacobVO> Mark them down on your map
[2:51:46] <MaybeFalco> oh sweet, another area i missed
[2:51:47] <+hoenhime344> im getting huge des vibes from this place
[2:51:47] <%nanaki_ff14> The old lady at roundtable
[2:51:53] <%epide> the acadmy dude

[2:51:58] <dan_g_v> time to check them all out again
[2:52:01] <rosabellamelantha> did pat open up gael tunnel?
[2:52:01] <+Shimano232> weird, i've been rocking like 20+ stonesword keys for like half the game so far.

[2:52:14] <rosabellamelantha> just wondering if alex's questline will continue
[2:52:18] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> That dude that's in the ass end of the underground with the big centipede lookin' thing?
[2:52:20] <rudiciuscaesar> I like this red earthen style cave, actually a major departure from standard Hyrule or Skyrim cave interiors
[2:52:23] <djblue_shift> Ant cave merchant?
[2:52:24] <%Bluwizard21> @Ash_Frey is it now, I havent come across it, I'll have to double back for it

[2:53:01] <%The_Protagonist> Halatali lookin different
[2:53:04] <+stellarseeker> the moment you open something all those gates are gonna unlock
[2:53:05] <%epide> the tp was the main academy gate might be there he had 2 of those sword keys for me
[2:53:09] <%Dakuu75> this is one where I HAD to use glow stones. (my sense of direction is ass'n a half)
[2:53:11] <AlexJacobVO> Love that you can jump. So fucking good
[2:53:14] <%JoshManVGH> Can't wait to ask my friends if they've been to the Scream Cave yet.
[2:53:16] <Saltmeisterr> tiny man
[2:53:16] <%ttipp> ttipp subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Even tough I disagree with about everything you say, you and woolley make a great podcast.
[2:53:18] <%Bluwizard21> those fucking militia guys are the worst
[2:53:30] <%Nekros4442> paige was at stormveil wasnt she?
[2:53:34] <+Grayhammatter> holy shit, this place is huge
[2:53:35] <zenith0111> All Ive been doing lately is just invading people LUL
[2:53:38] <rudiciuscaesar> potential switch?
[2:53:39] <penitentpendant> Perhaps a lever opens them all?
[2:53:40] <adithehella> this place is miserable :(
[2:53:41] <Gamer76255> Did you mean the Weeping Peninsula Merchant near the ocean? He sells 3 Keys
[2:53:41] <+pectusumbra> must be a lever that opens all the prison doors
[2:53:42] <Ash_Frey> @Bluwizard21 yeah, if im remembering correctly it.
[2:53:48] <huskarl_zap> Vulgar militia boys making vulgar noise
[2:53:49] <%Bluwizard21> probably a lever that opens everything and then you have to fight your way back out
[2:53:52] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> It kinda reminds me of earthbound audio in the caves
[2:53:52] <RickyRelucent> best time for invasions
[2:53:55] <+pectusumbra> Like ReMake2
[2:54:00] <RickyRelucent> nobody knows where they're going

[2:54:55] <huskarl_zap> Turtle neck or penis?

[2:55:41] <sozemd> pat is much farther than I was doing this part lmao
[2:55:43] <%nanaki_ff14> Hey Pat would you be willing to bring viewers in if a super boss is too hard?
[2:55:52] <Khester824> SNEAK ATTACK!
[2:56:04] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I'm runnin a SpellKnight and I have to tell you throwing those lightning bolts looks 1000% more satisfying that waving a wand in a circle and things dying
[2:56:05] <Manwad> just pulverize those fuckers
[2:56:08] <penitentpendant> He has SwOleg, he fine
[2:56:12] <huskarl_zap> Turtle head is Japanese vulgar slang for penis Kappa
[2:56:14] <MaybeFalco> oleg is cool
[2:56:15] <WooWho> Only Broleg
[2:56:18] <$SGrim> Oleg best friend
[2:56:18] <%Valdorick> I like that you have a force aura while in a backstab animation
[2:56:19] <%nanaki_ff14> Oleg is GOAT
[2:56:22] <%gag5y> its the Pat and Oleg Show not the Pat and Oleg and Chat show cmon guys
[2:56:22] <narusao> not a fan of humans
[2:56:22] <tanarath> The danger is real
[2:56:28] <+Shimano232> Oleg is my family now.
[2:56:36] <+alphonseisbest> god KING GIGCHAD OLEG BROLEG
[2:56:37] <%Reaped_Psyche> Humans ruin everything.
[2:56:38] <+Deosier> oleg is just too good
[2:56:38] <+pabloelenano2> ok path how about if we ask you for help?
[2:56:39] <Omenaire_> also summoning raises enemy hp
[2:56:42] <Ash_Frey> oleg really has been a real one in my adventures
[2:56:45] <%gag5y> commissioning Pat x Oleg yaoi art brb
[2:56:46] <mrtanaka111> pat the kind of guy to play ff online solo
[2:56:48] <%cade_calrayn> The only man Pat needs is Oleg.... and Elmo... and Gief
[2:56:51] <%JoshManVGH> In short: You can depend on NPCs.
[2:56:52] <%RigmaroleHM> That's how I feel about most games
[2:56:57] <%RigmaroleHM> Especially FFXIV
[2:57:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Oleg has a brother called Kristoff and hes just as cool
[2:57:08] <+null_the_exhero> There's at least one summon that's way better than Oleg, but you're from getting it yet
[2:57:11] <%nanaki_ff14> That murderd me the first time xD
[2:57:16] <%gag5y> is the brother single?
[2:57:16] <WooWho> How do you know when you can summon those spirits?
[2:57:19] <%Bluwizard21> that's actually way more convenient that I thought it would be
[2:57:24] <%gag5y> since olegs taken by pat
[2:57:26] <%Deft_Thought> Man. These people have it rough
[2:57:41] <$drabberfaun535> geol caves [extreme]

[2:57:57] <+sambws> @WooWho You'll see a grave icon on the left side of your screen
[2:57:58] <%Valdorick> Left Wall hug it out
[2:58:03] <+Resderp> It's actually simpler than you think
[2:58:07] <%gag5y> @BallerSwagBro9k smh ill just stick to Alexander
[2:58:15] <+pectusumbra> think there was an item in there in the back no?

[3:03:31] <+SaintSalted> *get summoned* *kill yourself* now the boss is twice as hard for them LUL
[3:03:36] <%Valdorick> Flame Clesnse Me is not power within, Pat
[3:03:43] <+pectusumbra> that's still not your buff
[3:03:51] <pi_in_the_sci> not the right spell
[3:03:58] <ziggy_1031> your using clense me pat, not the power buff
[3:04:04] <+Grayhammatter> yo, he rot good
[3:04:05] <+Based_Moose> Maximum cheese
[3:04:13] <+jacksawjack> He got the athlete's foot
[3:04:19] <huskarl_zap> Beta magic users vs the sigma Chad vig str build
[3:04:20] <%Bluwizard21> I want his helmet and I want either of these duelist chain linked weapons
[3:04:23] <AlexJacobVO> he rot very good
[3:04:33] <AlexJacobVO> but Pat die better
[3:04:41] <%Valdorick> Flame; Grant Me Strength
[3:04:44] <femto216> That‘s for not being jolly
[3:04:44] <sozemd> he can be parried
[3:04:45] <zenith0111> @ziggy_1031 It also boosts your resist
[3:04:49] <razz_zie> Btw u are constantly using ur cleanse
[3:04:52] <@Fuggins4U> It time, to DU-DU-DU-DU-DU-Die
[3:04:52] <rudiciuscaesar> you hear those violins going nuts there, sounded kinda Bloodborny
[3:04:59] <sozemd> fair
[3:05:00] <mrtanaka111> parry denier
[3:05:05] <+pectusumbra> Round 3. Will Pat use his clense instead of his buff a 3rd time?
[3:05:08] <%PrimalDweeb> Parrying is for suckers in this game.
[3:05:15] <%mugennoken> "Parries are a myth"
[3:05:19] <+Based_Moose> Pat you're cleansing not empowering
[3:05:19] <%Pookiedaexzile> It's fine to admit you can't Parry Pat
[3:05:21] <+pectusumbra> okay no he won't good job
[3:05:24] <moonbearbacon> as in... you dont think it real?
[3:05:25] <@Fuggins4U> summon fren
[3:05:25] <%NopeBadguy> Justin Wong didn't believe in parrying either
[3:05:28] <%SveriSageAdvice> its always funny how many times people will point out something being parryable despite not seeing a parry item in sight
[3:05:28] <%Pookiedaexzile> Plenty of guys have performance issues
[3:05:29] <tanarath> It's a central mechanic, but you do you.
[3:05:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pat doesn't believe in being cool Kappa
[3:05:33] <AlexJacobVO> Parries are a failure of the game design
[3:05:33] <ziggy_1031> @zenith0111 oh, didnt know that
[3:05:35] <ExpressNode> Oh yeah the new Final Fantasy Origins game is coming out soon as well as Triangle strategy. its full of RPGs in the first month of spring
[3:05:37] <+jacksawjack> Tie for Broleg
[3:05:38] <huskarl_zap> flame cleanse is just soap
[3:05:39] <RickyRelucent> ....did he not just parry him tho
[3:05:39] <MaybeFalco> i was actually having such a difficult time trying to parry in this compared to the soulsborne games
[3:05:45] <razz_zie> Oleg Oleg Oleg momosCheer
[3:05:51] <Gorgs7> yeah, the problem I see with parry is that it only works sometimes, so  why even bother
[3:05:52] <RickyRelucent> oh wait nvm he deflected with block
[3:06:02] <zenith0111> @huskarl_zap Oh then Im going to save MP now
[3:06:04] <%topendbuzza> jet parrys can't melt steel beams
[3:06:05] <%Bluwizard21> The parry window in this game is so damn small that it's a waste of time compared to guard counters
[3:06:07] <it_came_from_outer_space> bosses tend to have more resistance than the shrimp
[3:06:13] <RickyRelucent> oof
[3:06:18] <rudiciuscaesar> that weird kick the boss does...
[3:06:25] <%Valdorick> It went over him LUL
[3:06:26] <Blank9> yeah I have no idea why they made parrying harder than 3 or bloodborne
[3:06:29] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Man, the way dark souls people talk about dark souls, you're a baby bitch unless you exclusively go strength greatsword HP stamina, and then you get called the generic boring build, huh
[3:06:30] <razz_zie> Rot breath might be garbage
[3:06:30] <Blank9> significantly worse timing
[3:06:32] <%Ne1son> Shame that dragon head makes it so you cant see
[3:06:33] <AlexJacobVO> your rot is better starter move than mid fight
[3:06:35] <%tetraes> just try hitting him?
[3:06:41] <FeralFozzie> so rude of him to not stand still for you attack
[3:06:48] <%Bluwizard21> Games over if you can just stall now
[3:06:49] <%Valdorick> This is why I like Rotten Breath over the empowered version. Faster Cast time, no animation for flying up, it happens at the ground level
[3:06:53] <+jacksawjack> Pat will rot on this for this  strat.
[3:06:58] <huskarl_zap> I want this axe so bad
[3:07:01] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That grab was CLOSE
[3:07:01] <RickyRelucent> ya got him
[3:07:03] <RickyRelucent> ggs
[3:07:18] <%Valdorick> OH NO
[3:07:24] <nertiaa> bruh

[3:07:36] <mrtanaka111> almost broke the game
[3:07:37] <%luftraumm1> rot strikes again
[3:07:37] <razz_zie> LUL
[3:07:39] <%Bluwizard21> dead man choke slam
[3:07:42] <+jacksawjack> That was a slobberknocker
[3:07:48] <zenith0111> He said "Fuck this im done"
[3:07:51] <+Grayhammatter> no probablo
[3:07:52] <zenith0111> Then died
[3:07:53] <huskarl_zap> the reward is not the axe
[3:07:55] <+orochiblood> in from soft games, a win is a win is a win.
[3:07:56] <MaybeFalco> OH, thats how you get there
[3:07:58] <%Valdorick> B-bwah!?

[3:08:31] <+Local16> @PatStaresAt nvm you can't do the weapon art
[3:08:32] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Oh, is this the 1h version of that sith lord greatsword?
[3:08:32] <%topendbuzza> THE DRILL MOVE!?!?

[3:08:59] <zenith0111> No FP
[3:09:02] <%Brassnarwhal> no mana
[3:09:03] <MaybeFalco> the boomerang sword
[3:09:03] <+alphonseisbest> sith lord YEA
[3:09:04] <+pectusumbra> ahhh, not enough dex now
[3:09:09] <%Valdorick> Do you have a trinket to increase Dex?
[3:09:15] <+Based_Moose> Can we see wakizashi?
[3:09:20] <+alphonseisbest> at try again with fp maybe
[3:09:21] <chowndawg> it had a rounded tip
[3:09:22] <%Valdorick> Remember when testing weapons - if you're 5 points within, you can equip them to test stuff
[3:09:23] <RickyRelucent> anybody seen mlgs yet?
[3:09:38] <zenith0111> This is why im glad I went quality this time around
[3:09:38] <%Valdorick> YOOOOOOO
[3:09:39] <Blank9> wakizashi is basic dagger, but it power stances with katanas
[3:09:40] <+Akizea> THATS SICK
[3:09:40] <+alphonseisbest> dope

[3:09:47] <rommlll> everything is too cool
[3:09:49] <%GalacticaPhanto> Since I've been having trouble with the game I decided to say fuck it and go magic. I put my time in these games so imma cheese it
[3:09:52] <it_came_from_outer_space> lmao
[3:09:56] <%cade_calrayn> @RickyRelucent it's locked behind a long sidequest
[3:10:07] <%Felhad> @patstaresat if you don't know, all natural Arcane-scaling weapons are currently bugged and don't scale with any stats
[3:10:12] <%Bluwizard21> drillbuster
[3:10:17] <RickyRelucent> i look forward to it
[3:10:18] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> you get later
[3:10:20] <RickyRelucent> : D
[3:10:21] <$drabberfaun535> great if you can put status on it
[3:10:28] <%Dakuu75> fucking s'cuse me????
[3:10:32] <%Felhad> Oh, thats weird
[3:10:35] <rommlll> myth busted
[3:10:45] <rommlll> arcane do be like that
[3:10:48] <%cade_calrayn> ah that explains why the Reduvian knife is both OP and sucky later on
[3:10:50] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> balls exposed
[3:11:01] <zenith0111> No thats just making Arcance an actual stat to consider @felhad
[3:11:13] <RickyRelucent> :<
[3:11:24] <+badhaye> just getting here. you got that sword at gaol cave?
[3:11:29] <%Valdorick> Also, now that you're out of that dungeon, the hint from earlier; Scour the top of cliffs, climb tree branches.
[3:11:34] <RickyRelucent> yup
[3:11:34] <%Felhad> But id rather just put Bleed on a weapon with actual scaling and have slightly less bleed
[3:11:41] <+alphonseisbest> did that sith sword do bleed or fire?
[3:11:55] <zenith0111> @felhad I feel like you missed the poiny
[3:12:03] <RickyRelucent> dunno it looked bloody
[3:12:10] <+Grayhammatter> shrimp wizard

[3:12:49] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> this is Bloodborne asfuq
[3:12:51] <zenith0111> @felhad Its about the weapon skill. Not the status or the scaling+raw
[3:12:52] <%Felhad> My weapons with Blood Slash on them still scale their bleeding amount with my Arcane
[3:12:53] <digaogrunge> IS THIS A NURSERY?
[3:12:55] <%discoinfierno> :(((((
[3:13:00] <%Bluwizard21> The miracle of life

[3:13:34] <%jamsbybetty> this sword looks so cool
[3:13:34] <kinkade_77> theres no faith katana sadly
[3:13:34] <RickyRelucent> sword of reggarth
[3:13:40] <senfood> Space weebs
[3:13:40] <+sambws> It feels like there are way fewer dex faith weapons by comparison
[3:13:40] <ohno58> Space katana
[3:13:40] <%Pookiedaexzile> Dual Weild
[3:13:41] <+hoenhime344> @Meekest apparently there are no true mimics in the game
[3:13:41] <%epide> the abilty does 360 dam
[3:13:44] <zenith0111> They REALLY want you to go Int in this game
[3:13:44] <MrMoonGoose> Oof, that place looks unpleasant in the extreme.
[3:13:47] <+alphonseisbest> Pat could u bring that roman looking sword's name real quick?
[3:13:47] <%Felhad> Huh, maybe something to consider if I find one that I actually care for the Art on then
[3:13:49] <andoowhy> is that a Soka reference?
[3:13:49] <%delilah4you> PAt, can you show on the map where you got that?
[3:13:51] <+Pleblu> Skrimp on the burbie
[3:13:51] <%Valdorick> So... the Insect men are aliens?
[3:13:52] <%luftraumm1> moveset?

[3:14:00] <Tenebrae94> is there a faith katana?
[3:14:03] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt It was dropped from a zepplin while its owner was thwarting the firelord
[3:14:06] <%justcallmebobplease> WHAT A COOL ART IT HAS
[3:14:06] <+Nomenanza> maybe does gravity effect on charged r2s
[3:14:09] <%cade_calrayn> @Valdorick no, the Fallingstar Beast he fought from earlier
[3:14:09] <%delilah4you> Pat where on the map did you get that katana?
[3:14:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @valdorick No they worship them
[3:14:17] <%PrimalDweeb> Interesting
[3:14:23] <senfood> Of course there are two INT katanas. Nerds are weebs.
[3:14:25] <%Felhad> @zenith0111 lol, really? Theres so many more FTH weapons in my experience
[3:14:25] <bleugh> aliyms
[3:14:25] <%cade_calrayn> the Fallingstar Beasts are from meteors
[3:14:26] <sandsim> whoa thats cool lore
[3:14:27] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> A few of those Bog men looked like Grey Aliens Pat
[3:14:33] <@Fuggins4U> spoiler: they're invaders from planet EARTH
[3:14:34] <MrMoonGoose> Thoroughly unpleasant.
[3:14:36] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt have you fought Sokaan yet?

[3:14:44] <%Valdorick> Oh right! That monstrosity ! Fuck the Fallingstar beast
[3:14:46] <huskarl_zap> laynaAcTuALLy only intellectuals understand katanas and the Japanese devs know it
[3:14:47] <zenith0111> @felhad Theyre actually the best source of damage. I was doing 300 a hit on Mergit on my first encounters because of them

[3:17:39] <%jamsbybetty> I'm 70 and radhan is giving me real trouble :\
[3:17:43] <ItsMisterJason> I have watched like 60+ hours of this game. I started playing it today, all my knowledge went out the window. Blessing and a curse. Great cause now i'm going in blind, awful cause i'm going in blind. LUL

[3:18:01] <slipdog> Hey Pate what's this game called
[3:18:03] <sirrice77> @hoenhime344 ptsd from when the game teleports you into a mine with them in it while you're underleveled
[3:18:03] <$drabberfaun535> I beat radahn at level 157. still took work
[3:18:04] <%BinaryFireball> dm me if you want radhan tips lol
[3:18:19] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @BinaryFireball agreed, still haven't beaten him and i'm at the lava zone
[3:18:23] <%Valdorick> I like that the Map is rotting too
[3:18:37] <+ketaminekermit> has he fought radahn yet?
[3:18:44] <+Alsatorec> the most complex area to navigate...so far!
[3:18:45] <%twistedj3ster> this place looks like hell
[3:18:47] <%cade_calrayn> no
[3:18:47] <KasiCrafter> "Why is this place so small?" - Pat, about an hour ago
[3:18:50] <+SinisterBroccoli> so I've been doing yuras quest to get that arcane pole blade you get. is that weapon broken then?
[3:18:56] <+thickshield> everything is red and nasty, its hard to differentiate anything
[3:19:01] <%BinaryFireball> he becomes not bad if you do thing but dumb  but intended dumb but dumb
[3:19:23] <+marlborored5> ***
[3:19:35] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @BinaryFireball he's still dumb, unless you do a DIFFERENT thing from the thing you're thinking of
[3:19:35] <huskarl_zap> would you rather the rot army or the cuck army?
[3:19:51] <$SGrim> Why he head look like a pumpkin?
[3:20:09] <%Felhad> @sinisterbroccoli It's okay, but I'm preferring Godskin Peeler with Blood Slash on it instead
[3:20:21] <ItsMisterJason> Can you hold cast those?
[3:20:28] <+Pleblu> Thats pretty cool
[3:20:38] <%Valdorick> By the way Pat, you can jump before casting that, and you cast it from higher up, if its description isn't a lie
[3:20:51] <%twistedj3ster> chillin'
[3:20:57] <+hoenhime344> OMG those casters looked like the  the little kid king in DS3 at firelink
[3:21:02] <jbrachob> Hey youd be also doing nothing if your job was to Guard this place
[3:21:02] <plaguedoctor_vi> there a camp up this mountain
[3:21:09] <plaguedoctor_vi> of those solders
[3:21:17] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It sure feels like there's some goofy traversal you can do with these roots everywhere
[3:21:23] <Shiibbae> I think they were studying the polyps
[3:21:24] <ohno58> Did the shattering turn a bunch of people into zombies or what?
[3:21:41] <%twistedj3ster> pfft\
[3:21:49] <Heyestus> Pat that sword looks like something my cat would cough up. How can you even stand it?
[3:21:54] <slipdog> i think the dragon rot is this zones shtick
[3:22:00] <zenith0111> @ohno58 Well before the shattering everyone was basically immortal
[3:22:02] <%BinaryFireball> i will say radhan's weapons are dope though

[3:27:00] <%Bluwizard21> @Grayhammatter From what I understand of the lore, that is an amalgamation of failed sorcerers that the dark underbelly of the mage academy combined into a monster to give it more magical power

[3:32:09] <+alphonseisbest> wow with the dragon self own
[3:32:09] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Considering he's standing in a swamp of rot I don't think it's gonna effect him

[3:33:02] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I don't know why you were constantly building up Rot. You were on horsey and everything
[3:33:06] <Giztech> story is he lost a war against someone but was errored from the root

[3:33:38] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> Every spell time
[3:33:40] <%SveriSageAdvice> i cant quite tell what it is, but something with Crimson Rot lets it build on you even if you're no longer touching it
[3:33:40] <%PrimalDweeb> Yes, very beefy
[3:33:51] <%whyskeywolfe> Give it up Pat, he's Irish.

[3:53:53] <%Pookiedaexzile> Did he fight Red hair man
[3:54:30] <%Nobrev> @zaddyforever I'm getting my ass beat by a teleporting sorcerer asshole
[3:54:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> im getting my shit slapped by giant hands
[3:54:51] <%linSP> linSP subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! hi pattuh i just got my first great rune after combing limgrave and am heading into red rot zone the legit way. as a magic user is this the correct path?
[3:55:40] <sirrice77> Absolutely not, you need to go north along side the castle and get to liurnia and do the academy to get spell stuff
[3:55:46] <+zaddyforever> caria and the hands whooped me until i just started sneaking with my head on a swivel
[3:55:53] <+zaddyforever> and now they keep popping back up
[3:55:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> @linSP it's certainly *A* path
[3:56:00] <%LeiaSkynoober> There's the meteorite staff in red rot zone but honestly keep going into Liurnia for more magic things
[3:56:28] <SaltBuster> did pat find the big sword in the area?
[3:56:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> @sirrice77 you can just go through the castle too right?
[3:56:39] <+zaddyforever> rock sling and the meteorite staff are pretty easy to grab, everything else is mostly liurnia
[3:56:42] <xxHungryxx> To anyone in chat using sorcery, what do you think of Carian Piercer? I have Slicer and was thinking of adding that to my spells as well
[3:56:52] <+zaddyforever> some stuff further too
[3:56:56] <sirrice77> @ReallyBigRocks yup
[3:57:08] <+Resderp> Ugghhhh.... I hate Crucible Knight. Even with parry strats
[3:57:20] <+zaddyforever> did you find that greathammer spell? i’ve tried it a couple times and like it
[3:57:24] <sirrice77> @Resderp i have bad news
[3:57:37] <+Resderp> Oh i know.
[3:57:38] <+Resderp> There's more.

[4:01:50] <rosabellamelantha> correct
[4:01:50] <%Dakuu75> feels like it
[4:01:51] <huskarl_zap> no
[4:01:51] <%Valdorick> they're just awful
[4:01:51] <%SveriSageAdvice> that is indeed correct
[4:01:54] <ItsMisterJason> I'll take some honey hot, i'd like wings but not in the mood to order some that would cuse me pain
[4:01:55] <Heyestus> elaborate
[4:01:57] <rommlll> this map feels like a whole dungeon
[4:01:58] <mrtanaka111> hidden dungeons
[4:02:00] <%SveriSageAdvice> it has dungeons but not many
[4:02:02] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Yes, @valdorick . you had Chinese earlier
[4:02:07] <digaogrunge> Boneless are not wings
[4:02:08] <%hewlettfan96> @thomassolorio You shit piss from your dick?
[4:02:14] <hardblackfleecejohnson> I've lost 10 pounds since elden ring came out
[4:02:16] <SaltBuster> they are there. it's just under all this red.
[4:02:19] <rosabellamelantha> Limgrave and Limuria are the most dense areas
[4:02:20] <%Undenizen> it appears to be more... fucky.
[4:02:25] <%hewlettfan96> Buffalo wings? Where did u find buffalos
[4:02:27] <rommlll> can you ride that
[4:02:27] <%Dakuu75> I thought it was a Digimon
[4:02:30] <+red_cuppa> kitty
[4:02:33] <hermitdab> so i've only played bloodborne until today when i got elden ring and holllllyyyyyyy shittttttttttt i am getting wrecked
[4:02:36] <%Brassnarwhal> dog squeezed psaLiz
[4:02:37] <+tizziks> Out of curiosity, why is this a "naruto?"
[4:02:37] <tinytinykittycat> Maybe they went ham on the early areas
[4:02:38] <+TheBitingIrish> I HATE the dino dogs
[4:02:39] <%hewlettfan96> Naruto ugh
[4:02:42] <projecthazoid> Did the workd turn to shit and red or is this a different region?
[4:02:42] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[4:02:43] <+thickshield> its a lot smaller then the other regions. the altus area has way to many i feel lol
[4:02:45] <VirtuaRailith> i always called them chipp lions
[4:02:45] <+AyupaPupa> Chipp Zanuff
[4:02:48] <VirtuaRailith> because they got the armblade
[4:02:55] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> lol Pat How is this a Naeruto?
[4:03:00] <%Undenizen> holy shit that boy is loud
[4:03:00] <Sunstalker> Uh, there's more then you think but not as much as the Lakes. It's roughly on par ith Limgrave for dungeons.
[4:03:03] <femto216> There are no lions in Naruto
[4:03:09] <plaguedoctor_vi> they have less but there less area in comparison to the other places you been, don´t you agree Pat?
[4:03:15] <%Bluwizard21> these ninja lions need to chill the fuck out
[4:03:18] <+tizziks> the armblade has what to do with naruto though>
[4:03:21] <+pectusumbra> I'm sorry that did just say Beast Blood yeah?
[4:03:22] <jnexgen717> haha awesome
[4:03:22] <VirtuaRailith> Now a real beast appears

[4:05:43] <%rdark_ksu> Hey Pat Primitive Technology just  uploaded a video for the first time in like 2 years
[4:05:53] <%jamsbybetty> you can explore going south out of the beast cleric's place too don't forget
[4:06:02] <%nanaki_ff14> Giant tower
[4:06:08] <%Brassnarwhal> it was @sunstalker @patstaresat
[4:06:08] <plaguedoctor_vi> you need to solve the puzle
[4:06:14] <%hewlettfan96> How big is the map exactly? Is it Skyrim size
[4:06:15] <+thickshield> you dont. there is a way around
[4:06:16] <femto216> It is Australia
[4:06:17] <+sambws> You can come at that part of the map from the west
[4:06:18] <Sunstalker> Yeah, that big gargoyle at the werewolf pope drops it. Plus a holy halberd. The fights pretty simple with an ultragreatshield
[4:06:18] <plaguedoctor_vi> to get pass the area
[4:06:30] <%Bluwizard21> @rdark_ksu he's apparently been making a tv show based on his stuff
[4:06:30] <%hewlettfan96> Or more GTA size
[4:06:34] <+pabloelenano2> bigger than skyrim
[4:06:42] <%Dakuu75> it's probably like 3 skyrim. (but I never playued skyrim)
[4:06:43] <%Valdorick> He's immune to Rot too!

[4:07:05] <%depressed_skeleton> help
[4:07:06] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt It's a smaller map than skyrim but it is denser
[4:07:06] <+alphonseisbest> i'd say 1 1/2 skyims in size
[4:07:08] <%hewlettfan96> @dakuu75 That do be big
[4:07:10] <%Brassnarwhal> @sunstalker I'm glad i called that to pat i might have to go fight that fuck too
[4:07:17] <Sunstalker> I don't think a single status even works on that black gargoyle. I could not get him poisoned or bled with my morningstar
[4:07:20] <mrtanaka111> ghosts are real
[4:07:24] <%NopeBadguy> Totalbiscuit described Skyrim as "the width of an ocean with the depth of a puddle" and I'm curious what'd he say about this today
[4:07:26] <xxHungryxx> Magic Ghosts
[4:07:32] <SaltBuster> burger King ghosts
[4:07:33] <Ner234> Piss off ghosts

[4:07:49] <%hewlettfan96> Piss off fake humans
[4:07:49] <%TheGuesty> lot of rooftop shit
[4:07:50] <%Brassnarwhal> @sunstalker how does he feel about the tree sentinel halberd? am i gonna have a bad time?
[4:07:51] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Skyrim is probably physically bigger, but it sure as fuck Isn't as dense
[4:07:57] <%Brassnarwhal> i have it plus 5
[4:07:58] <%TheGuesty> like A LOT of rooftop shit
[4:08:02] <%Undenizen> Holy shit my rat tried to eat the power cable to my PC

[4:08:27] <SomeAsianDood> 1/3 Pog
[4:08:28] <Ner234> ratJAM
[4:08:31] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Easy to miss boss down to the left of that golden seed
[4:08:32] <%MidnightBasker> Shoulda sumerged your cable in mineral oil so he wouldnt be able to get to it
[4:08:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> thats a good way to kill a rat and a PC
[4:08:33] <%Undenizen> I'm amazed how he hasn't died yet. he tries t eat every cable i have
[4:08:34] <%Brassnarwhal> @undenizen is he okay?
[4:08:34] <Treasure_Vault> I wonder where Elden Ring was in development during production of the Ringed City dlc.
[4:08:40] <Omenaire_> skyrim couldnt tickle this games balls
[4:08:43] <Sunstalker> @Brassnarwhal Uh, tree sentinel's pretty simple. Its skill is more useful for multiplayer though
[4:08:44] <Ashenik1> chat, what tier rating would you give to greatsword in Elden Ring?
[4:08:46] <Ashenik1> LUL
[4:08:48] <%notsoy> classic patforming

[4:09:17] <Sunstalker> Oh, each fire opens a door and all 3 opens the boss room next to the stairs
[4:09:18] <%Undenizen> @Brassnarwhal Yeah. either it's harder than you think to jump cables with your teeth, or those electrical engineers know what they're doing.
[4:09:33] <kingmemelord97> Hey , Pat since you been  playing the game for awhile do you feel this is the formula fromsoftware  should follow for souls games in the future ?
[4:09:44] <%Brassnarwhal> @sunstalker i mean am i gonna deal no damage to the gargoyle using the tree sentinel halberd, my damage is holy i don't wanna start that fight and lose all my runes if i am not good enough lol
[4:09:45] <Omenaire_> wow im surprised i got through this town before pat did

[4:10:18] <$Mekhet09> Get fucked.
[4:10:22] <Sunstalker> @Brassnarwhal Oh yeah, don't fight him with Holy dmg. The gargoyle is a holy alligned enemy
[4:10:23] <%Bluwizard21> fun place ya?
[4:10:28] <Saltmeisterr> jesus christ

[4:10:46] <RubberFistFight> IN THE VILLAGE OF THE BURGER KING
[4:10:47] <Sunstalker> He guards the beast church, he's pious
[4:10:48] <%Ne1son> Gargoyles protect churches
[4:10:49] <%Pookiedaexzile> Yeah didn't you watch the show?
[4:10:55] <%Valdorick> Yeah, he's guarding a Beast Cleric.
[4:11:00] <%Pookiedaexzile> Disney Did a whole Documentary
[4:11:00] <nesbitt22> Pat how many Gods you kill?
[4:11:02] <CunnymobileBrakeFluid> gargoyles spend all day at church
[4:11:10] <tanarath> @brassnarwhal I think it's called Comet
[4:11:11] <%Brassnarwhal> @sunstalker that tracks, and he's not even hostile it's really cool honestly
[4:11:11] <+wizard_of_diamonds> He has so much shit I'm so jealous
[4:11:14] <Sunstalker> I just beat him with the Gilded.
[4:11:28] <Ashenik1> is guts Greatsword in Elden Ring a weapon worth investing into whole game?
[4:11:34] <%Brassnarwhal> what's wrong with gilded?
[4:11:39] <%Undenizen> i for real love the design of the gargoyle bosses. they look like they came right out of a medieval manuscript
[4:11:48] <%Bluwizard21> @RubberFistFight That's why it looks the way it does, too much sneak king
[4:12:04] <%Brassnarwhal> @ashenik1 it almost always is but I haven't used it in this one yet, it's very heavy this time
[4:12:07] <Sunstalker> Gilded greatshield and like 16 Endurance can tank just enough for every chain he does. You just gotta dodge both variants of his magic attack
[4:12:22] <%TheGuesty> there needs to be a shield that at least protects 100% of one element
[4:12:36] <%Brassnarwhal> @sunstalker great tips appreciate your service
[4:12:49] <%Undenizen> has the game given any explanation why some areas are infested with ghosts?
[4:12:56] <Sunstalker> You get up there by using the staircase with the root hanging over
[4:13:02] <%barrakuta371> that whip range is nuts
[4:13:06] <%PrimalDweeb> The fuck kind of reach is that?
[4:13:08] <%Ne1son> Lightning bolt
[4:13:12] <SomeAsianDood> OLEG
[4:13:19] <Ashenik1> @Brassnarwhal barely able to squeeze in a dodge attack
[4:13:21] <%Brassnarwhal> can we get his weapon?
[4:13:27] <%PrimalDweeb> Very noice
[4:13:27] <%Brassnarwhal> the ball chain thing
[4:13:31] <%Pookiedaexzile> Thought that said Not instead of Nox
[4:13:33] <%Valdorick> Man, the scaling of Caelid is FUCKED
[4:13:36] <%PrimalDweeb> GG
[4:13:40] <%Valdorick> these guys are NOT on par with Oneil
[4:13:41] <%jamsbybetty> these guys are kinda chumps
[4:13:46] <%Undenizen> oh damn. i have that spirit but not enough FP to summon him.
[4:13:47] <SomeAsianDood> Ivy sword
[4:13:53] <%twistedj3ster> It's like Vaan's!

[4:14:09] <Heyestus> Goopy
[4:14:11] <%Valdorick> Oh, its a Slaneesh Whip
[4:14:12] <%twistedj3ster> Gun X Sword sword
[4:14:12] <%Pookiedaexzile> IVY
[4:14:12] <Ashenik1> Bloodborne thing kindda!!
[4:14:13] <%Undenizen> damn that's weord
[4:14:14] <%Brassnarwhal> awesome
[4:14:17] <Omenaire_> boneless sword
[4:14:20] <%Bluwizard21> I do not like the sound it makes
[4:14:21] <Anidem1714> I should just move on right, I'm scared to miss anything in the first zone
[4:14:21] <+zaddyforever> @valdorick it’s so weird, i beat these guys in two seconds but other things will eat me alive
[4:14:23] <%PrimalDweeb> Maybe R2
[4:14:25] <$Mekhet09> It's no threaded cane but nothing can be.
[4:14:29] <+pectusumbra> a whip sword that makes a gross noise when you use it. sounds like bones shifting yeah
[4:14:30] <femto216> Ew the sound
[4:14:35] <%Undenizen> yeah why is it.... goopy?
[4:14:37] <$Mekhet09> It'd be nice.
[4:14:38] <%PrimalDweeb> Weird
[4:14:42] <%twistedj3ster> I'd ejaculate
[4:14:43] <SaltBuster> I like my swords boneless
[4:14:44] <%Bluwizard21> best staff
[4:14:45] <+thickshield> that staff is pretty SICK
[4:14:47] <%xcompleasedad> 50
[4:14:49] <$Mekhet09> It's the strongest staff in the game lol.
[4:14:50] <Sunstalker> I wish the Beast Cutter was in every fromsoft game
[4:14:52] <+Akizea> @Anidem1714 you WILL NOT get everything in the first zone so you may as well try to save your own sanity and be okay with missing atleast something
[4:14:52] <+zaddyforever> i guess everything in more rotted areas is just fucked scaling wise
[4:14:58] <%Valdorick> Best Staff, just like every staff
[4:14:58] <+thickshield> blow your ass off your ass staff
[4:15:01] <%Pookiedaexzile> Whirlygig is in
[4:15:03] <KingKZ> Oleg feels like a member of the family at this point.
[4:15:08] <sirrice77> theres a ton of staffs in the game, and like no seals lol
[4:15:08] <it_came_from_outer_space> A staff for every outfit, sorcerers are just like that
[4:15:22] <%Valdorick> At this point Pat, I feel like we're just saying "best staff in the game" no matter what
[4:15:22] <%delilah4you> Hey so I just found a physick that negates ALL FP CONSUMPTION
[4:15:25] <%delilah4you> HOLY SHIT
[4:15:26] <%PrimalDweeb> Wait, ring bell
[4:15:27] <%Brassnarwhal> @anidem1714 it's basically impossible to get absolutely everything without googling, try to avoid that mindset. it's hard for me but if i try to scrape everything I'll never beat the game
[4:15:31] <%Bluwizard21> STA
[4:15:31] <%minimumeffortmaximumderp> I was just in a boss fight where I was one hit away from winning when I lost connection with the server and had to restart
[4:15:32] <%Valdorick> ANOTHER ONE
[4:15:32] <mrtanaka111> radahn drops a holy sword
[4:15:32] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt is this loss? Kappa
[4:15:34] <%Bluwizard21> FF
[4:15:36] <hardblackfleecejohnson> thats the strongest staff in the game

[4:15:46] <%Brassnarwhal> @delilah4you that's incredible
[4:15:49] <SomeAsianDood> I mean you are in the town of sorcery so Idk what you'd expect
[4:15:49] <%PrimalDweeb> Go up ladders, ring bells
[4:15:50] <+kewlmyc> Which staff did he find before the staff of loss?
[4:15:52] <Omenaire_> could this be a loss?
[4:15:56] <%Valdorick> Mage Hat
[4:15:57] <%Bluwizard21> its like you're in a sorcerers town
[4:16:01] <+imthewisejanitor> Wait what that horse doin'
[4:16:02] <dan_g_v> staffs are for nerd tho

[4:16:17] <RubberFistFight> ahahahha get punked nerd
[4:16:18] <%xcompleasedad> @delilah4you If you are Sorcery, there's an Omegabeam that that Physik combos with
[4:16:18] <jubejube56> When you go to church town you can have fun, for now it’s sorcerer town
[4:16:20] <%cade_calrayn> YUP
[4:16:21] <%PrimalDweeb> He teleports
[4:16:22] <RubberFistFight> you gotta hit those from ranged
[4:16:23] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Try ranged
[4:16:25] <Ashenik1> I really appreciate From's dediaction to create so many types of dogs in EL :3
[4:16:25] <%SveriSageAdvice> that one has to get hit with a ranged attack
[4:16:26] <tidesplitter27> Man the new assassin’s creed looks broken af lol
[4:16:27] <sirrice77> Oh  yeah sometimes they teleport not disappear
[4:16:27] <%cade_calrayn> New kind of scarab
[4:16:28] <+thickshield> gmartMad
[4:16:29] <MsYakumo> Oh hey. It's that cheeky little fucker.
[4:16:32] <%Brassnarwhal> fuck these teleport ones are such assholes
[4:16:37] <Sunstalker> Yeah this one teleports between four spots if you get close. You can do it with melee but it's tricky
[4:16:47] <Anidem1714> ya'll right, I just needed someone to say it was ok
[4:16:47] <femto216> There are like 10 magic zones
[4:16:52] <%linSP> i was jumping all over these roofs without a horse when the game first came out thanks to that chest
[4:16:53] <%ChrisPlaysThing> The horse has a double jump?!
[4:17:01] <%Brassnarwhal> fast projectile, they saw my fireball coming
[4:17:06] <SomeAsianDood> yes the horse is brazilian @ChrisPlaysThing
[4:17:06] <%Valdorick> That's just the first unlocked attack in Sekrio, isn't it?
[4:17:10] <%PrimalDweeb> Why
[4:17:13] <MsYakumo> You.... didn't know it had a double jump?
[4:17:15] <%Bluwizard21> That's a fun Idea, We help pat during a stream with only message style prompts in chat
[4:17:18] <%PrimalDweeb> did I think it was a bell?
[4:17:37] <%PrimalDweeb> I just did this, must be sleep brain.
[4:17:43] <%Puhff> try but hole
[4:17:44] <$thomassolorio> weres the 4th
[4:17:50] <%Brassnarwhal> @bluwizard21 it's how i avoid saying spoilers when i want to share tips
[4:17:53] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I've been a radio view for most of this, and i don't watch anything else elden Ring, it's just not my jam
[4:17:54] <MsYakumo> Why fingers, but hole?
[4:18:03] <%PrimalDweeb> That guy's a fuck
[4:18:05] <%Valdorick> The last one in the game
[4:18:06] <xxHungryxx> Special Beam Cannon
[4:18:06] <MaybeFalco> nice
[4:18:09] <+sambws> Fuck I didn't find that
[4:18:11] <MidnightPacif1c> yeye
[4:18:14] <%Bluwizard21> thats where the last key is, I've been wondering
[4:18:17] <%Brassnarwhal> anybody know where to get that helix spell?
[4:18:23] <Sunstalker> I've found +2s
[4:18:29] <Sunstalker> In ng1 still
[4:18:30] <%Valdorick> There's another chest on the main street of the time
[4:18:31] <%ChrisPlaysThing> It's the Ghosts again
[4:18:32] <%linSP> uh oh how high do they go
[4:18:35] <Iza_kku> gotta be barking at a ghost
[4:18:38] <%PrimalDweeb> Now you can go get map
[4:18:38] <%Valdorick> Town, not time*
[4:18:40] <%Brassnarwhal> oh fuck plus 1 in ng
[4:18:44] <%luftraumm1> I bet there's one more
[4:18:47] <%Bluwizard21> @Brassnarwhal Isn't it in this area somewhere?
[4:18:54] <%Pookiedaexzile> He's Roaring into the void out of spite
[4:18:56] <sozemd> I got a +8 from edgar
[4:19:12] <%Bluwizard21> Cruisin on down mainstreet you're relaxed and feelin good
[4:19:14] <lethallylactic> Isn't there also a door by the shore?
[4:19:18] <%Brassnarwhal> @bluwizard21 if i knew i would be telling people not asking lol, but that's enough info for me
[4:19:24] <mrtanaka111> nightmen cometh
[4:19:28] <%Bluwizard21> Next thing that you know, there's an octopus in the neighborhood?
[4:19:33] <%linSP> the spells are cool and woolie is going to love it
[4:19:33] <%Puhff> then go to a different zone
[4:19:42] <%Undenizen> so that's a PVP spell
[4:19:43] <xxHungryxx> Sorcery Supremacy
[4:19:54] <%PrimalDweeb> You don't want to unlock map?
[4:19:56] <+LandOfTheWay> oh yeah, this invasion
[4:20:01] <%Bluwizard21> @Brassnarwhal It was more a I think it's in Caleid kind of question than actually asking you
[4:20:09] <sozemd> how can you not feel hard for the giant hammer spell
[4:20:14] <%Valdorick> Go near the ghost
[4:20:17] <+pectusumbra> I mean dumb question with this one, have you tried just idling in the area?
[4:20:17] <%Ne1son> time of day?
[4:20:19] <+LandOfTheWay> didn't someone say he might spawn slightly above the church?
[4:20:21] <%Valdorick> on the bottom of the hill, then go back up to the church?
[4:20:23] <+thickshield> ive not gotten it to work either :L
[4:20:25] <%luftraumm1> suppose there's a trigger?
[4:20:33] <Sunstalker> Try sticking on the path? I've had an invader elsewhere not show up until I walked over an exact spot of road
[4:20:34] <TheBlankAce> You got another teleporter key
[4:20:34] <+stellarseeker> @PatStaresAt Four Belfries?
[4:20:38] <+chimaera24> He literally spawns in front of the church guys
[4:20:41] <%Brassnarwhal> @bluwizard21 that's fair, i love how cool all the sorceries and i cantations are, it's so much fun to find them
[4:20:43] <%Puhff> have you tried talking to candace??
[4:20:54] <+LandOfTheWay> oh that's stupid as shit
[4:20:54] <%luftraumm1> that's bullshit
[4:20:58] <deviljhojho_> touch grace
[4:21:02] <penitentpendant> Yeah, there's a lot of parts of this where things break
[4:21:06] <%ReugaLive> people are speculating all sort of shit for why this dude chooses to now spawn
[4:21:07] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat ruined the game damn
[4:21:10] <%sniffy77> One of my favorite things about elden ring is that I've basically heard nothing about what comes after liurnia and caelid because the game is so big after a week
[4:21:14] <%Valdorick> Well, that is unfortunate then.
[4:21:17] <+brandonsbetow> hey @PatStaresAt you will know the invasion fails to trigger immediately if you mount up, invasions trigger the no mount for "multiplayer"
[4:21:21] <SomeAsianDood> Yeah Candice is a story integral NPC no?
[4:21:26] <Gav_EXE> I could believe that breaks it. There's an invader in the scarlet rot that never reappeared for me. Could be a similar reason.
[4:21:32] <Midnight188> so theres a questline thats broken?
[4:21:43] <%luftraumm1> did you kill the beast men?
[4:21:56] <MaybeFalco> yeah i didnt like this one as much as the other two
[4:21:56] <+Resderp> oh no.
[4:22:02] <huskarl_zap> nokron these
[4:22:04] <deviljhojho_> this place looks like my screen saver
[4:22:05] <+Resderp> This one sucks ass.
[4:22:08] <xxHungryxx> The Underdark
[4:22:08] <deviljhojho_> from 2008
[4:22:09] <mikesapartment> welcome in nokron
[4:22:12] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt You chose poorly, I did the same
[4:22:13] <sirrice77> The item from here is really good tho
[4:22:20] <%BinaryFireball> oh it is
[4:22:22] <%jamsbybetty> wait wut how you get the other half of the underground map
[4:22:24] <%PrimalDweeb> Have you tried teleporting to a different location and then riding to the invasion point?
[4:22:25] <%Nobrev> this is the place blaidd was looking for right
[4:22:26] <%Bluwizard21> oh, well nvm then
[4:22:29] <%BinaryFireball> there are 4 lights
[4:22:32] <%Valdorick> Its the last one, the best one to open last
[4:22:37] <+Nomenanza> these teleporters seem to only be there as a preview of cool zones you'll see later
[4:22:38] <%murdocismyhero> This area looks so trippy
[4:22:41] <rickbeanbag42069> this one looks cool
[4:22:43] <%twohitgood> which invasion is broken?
[4:22:43] <%epide> i honestly wonder if they didnt just put like 4 games together
[4:22:45] <%PrimalDweeb> Well that sucks
[4:22:54] <%BinaryFireball> all I gotta say....are youuuuu readddyyy toooo RUUUMMBBBLLEEEE
[4:22:57] <baphometseinfeld> It's like those paintings in Mario Odyssey
[4:22:57] <%ReugaLive> crucible knights are my most hated enemies
[4:22:59] <+Resderp> "Didnt expect friend"
[4:23:00] <blue8moon> yeah these ones are just little treasure spots
[4:23:01] <%linSP> its him the guy i saw earlier
[4:23:03] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Have Fromsoft addressed it?
[4:23:03] <+Resderp> Then i saw who it was.
[4:23:03] <+kewlmyc> Crucible Knight!
[4:23:03] <%NopeBadguy> Have you tried turning it off and on again
[4:23:04] <+Grayhammatter> a lone badass over there
[4:23:05] <%Bluwizard21> he must have done the starter area last stream
[4:23:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> free
[4:23:06] <deviljhojho_> incoming freakshow
[4:23:08] <KasiCrafter> Wait, wasn't there more stuff above?
[4:23:08] <SaltBuster> it's 1 guy
[4:23:11] <+Resderp> Crucible Knights are a lesson in bullshittery.

[4:23:22] <%cade_calrayn> Nokron? Yeah it's a zone
[4:23:23] <deviljhojho_> lets see if we can get him to drop
[4:23:25] <%linSP> robuss
[4:23:25] <%Brassnarwhal> i think it's too son to say things are broken it could just be some weird fucked up other action needed to trigger it that people aren't even aware of. to get grape girl to spawn you have to do the save the other girls dad quest in the weeping peninsula. who knows what bullshit people need to have done or not done.
[4:23:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> how bad could it possibly be
[4:23:26] <%PrimalDweeb> Robussy

[4:24:49] <%ChrisPlaysThing> ded
[4:24:49] <Sunstalker> This guy's good parry practice honestly. You can parry most of his attacks, including the dash and the two handed twirl
[4:24:50] <+Resderp> Yeah he doesnt care about your barricade with shield bash LUL

[4:27:19] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt i just looked up ghost dog, what the fuck is this shit
[4:27:22] <Heyestus> Weren't  they weak to lightning before?
[4:27:27] <digaogrunge> parries
[4:27:27] <peachy996> And you should get it
[4:27:30] <Gav_EXE> I would love to know what they're weak to. They don't appear to be weak to anything.
[4:27:32] <STORMWIZARD1> Ground Lightning ?
[4:27:38] <Frozen_phoenix> what kind of cheese? cheddar? parmesan?
[4:27:38] <%slrls_> can't you just fast travel there?
[4:27:38] <%twohitgood> try strike damage since he's armored? @PatStaresAt
[4:27:39] <+wotn_weisskaiser> He does a stinger almost every time you try to heal or cast a spell, I took him out by baiting him into charged attacks
[4:27:39] <%Undenizen> everyone is weak to cheese
[4:27:41] <%luftraumm1> cheese it up like ratatouille
[4:27:44] <%jamsbybetty> crussy knights are weak to ppxls
[4:27:44] <FeralFozzie> when in doubt, cheese it out
[4:27:44] <Sunstalker> Bandai namco just announced they're giving all their japanese employees a 50k yen raise to monthly salaries.
[4:27:44] <%PrimalDweeb> May the cheese grace us
[4:27:50] <rommlll> new armor loos fancy
[4:27:53] <Khester824> he doesn't bleed
[4:27:54] <%Brassnarwhal> @frozen_phoenix needs to be stinkier
[4:27:59] <%cade_calrayn> No, the Centurion Knights use holy powers
[4:28:06] <%Brassnarwhal> @sunstalker excellent
[4:28:08] <xxHungryxx> and sword too
[4:28:12] <+Resderp> Who actually thought crucible knights were a fun fight rooMadslam
[4:28:13] <+alphonseisbest> its super cool
[4:28:16] <%twohitgood> i fully believe it. the DS1R network test had the black k**** as a starter class.
[4:28:18] <MaybeFalco> honestly i'd assume lightning because of the dragon shit they do
[4:28:19] <+Grayhammatter> could always try a striking weapon
[4:28:20] <$Surion84> You could try rot?
[4:28:20] <rommlll> "I ain't got time to bleed"
[4:28:24] <$Surion84> with the dragon roar
[4:28:25] <%Brassnarwhal> poison mist weapon art?
[4:28:33] <$Surion84> oh damn
[4:28:34] <%luftraumm1> git gud kind of enemy

[4:28:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> just beat ass
[4:28:51] <%GelatinBoi> bait his big move so he flies off the edge?
[4:28:52] <%Deft_Thought> OLEG

[4:28:53] <%Brassnarwhal> that pillory shield is fucking sick
[4:28:54] <rommlll> he's pondering
[4:28:55] <%Ynkubus_> punt of the edge!
[4:28:57] <+brandonsbetow> might be weak to smashing
[4:28:58] <Heyestus> It's  the hit don't get hit way
[4:28:58] <%twohitgood> get him to fall off the edge 👍
[4:28:58] <KasiCrafter> Parrying?
[4:28:59] <peachy996> He is protected by the Listerine Coated Armor
[4:29:01] <+alphonseisbest> BACK STAP FISHING

[4:29:17] <rommlll> DAMN
[4:29:17] <+leviting> wasn't one of these guys in an evergaol?
[4:29:18] <Namillus> Is that a dumbass stockade shield
[4:29:18] <%Brassnarwhal> its gonna be a parry
[4:29:18] <%luftraumm1> that tracking LUL
[4:29:25] <+alphonseisbest> BACK STAB clap clap clap
[4:29:26] <%jamsbybetty> I think they might be immune to backstab
[4:29:27] <MaybeFalco> @YoruM2 if they aren't blocking, yeah
[4:29:31] <+TheBitingIrish> They cannot be backstabbed
[4:29:31] <rommlll> try later idk
[4:29:33] <%Brassnarwhal> don't think they can be backstabbed
[4:29:35] <$Surion84> what is pat wearing on his back
[4:29:37] <+Resderp> Pat have fun because i gave up on this guy for a while.
[4:29:49] <SomeAsianDood> a pinion. no idea what it does
[4:29:51] <x2Twistedx> his overhead left to right is pretty easy to parry after the shield lunge
[4:29:51] <%boggsz12> they're pretty easy to parry, if that helps
[4:29:52] <ebrion> Rot him?
[4:29:55] <+hero_theycallme210> just parry
[4:29:59] <+Grayhammatter> he's wearing a stockade
[4:29:59] <Heyestus> Pillory shield
[4:30:00] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Did Pat beat this guy when he had a name?
[4:30:02] <%cylish> jump attacks to kill poise?
[4:30:03] <sozemd> I tried quickstep and it didn't work
[4:30:05] <+Resderp> THATS THE ATTACK THAT FUCKS ME

[4:30:14] <+zaddyforever> pat absolutely hates parrying
[4:30:14] <huskarl_zap> Froage
[4:30:15] <Ner234> woah what
[4:30:16] <+Grayhammatter> holy shit
[4:30:16] <Heyestus> A pillory is the thing they put you in when you're  sent to the stocks
[4:30:18] <%xcompleasedad> Motherfucker puts Pursuer to shame
[4:30:20] <xxHungryxx> Eww his throat swelled
[4:30:20] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Ah yeah I remember him
[4:30:22] <%luftraumm1> pat is great at this game he just has to stick with it
[4:30:24] <peachy996> Oh he's an Angemon
[4:30:26] <%Valdorick> oof
[4:30:27] <%sniffy77> you can do it
[4:30:28] <Saltmeisterr> frogge
[4:30:28] <%PrimalDweeb> I want wings...
[4:30:30] <LuminusVows> that was a good attempt
[4:30:31] <it_came_from_outer_space> btw pat try power within and phyxick
[4:30:31] <%Ne1son> the early role
[4:30:32] <%NopeBadguy> too early
[4:30:33] <Sunstalker> Side roll way safer for that
[4:30:33] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Why you roll backwards Pat Man
[4:30:35] <%Ne1son> roll
[4:30:35] <%genepark> Wtf I’ve never seen him do that
[4:30:36] <+pectusumbra> damn. that was closer for sure
[4:30:37] <%BubbaRands> SIIIIICK
[4:30:38] <rommlll> but you got some good hits in though
[4:30:39] <+marlborored5> that's a cool motherfucker huh
[4:30:41] <%jamsbybetty> seems doable
[4:30:41] <+alphonseisbest> WHY IS HE SOOOO COOL?
[4:30:42] <%PrimalDweeb> Food time
[4:30:42] <%slrls_> use flail weapon art to push him off
[4:30:44] <%twistedj3ster> well that was anghellic
[4:30:45] <peachy996> Nice time
[4:30:48] <%Bluwizard21> The death screams from male and female are pretty gnarly this game
[4:30:50] <%NopeBadguy> for who time
[4:30:50] <%Brassnarwhal> can you get the wing dive as a weapon art?
[4:30:52] <%NopeBadguy> gief time?
[4:30:52] <KasiCrafter> Well, at least you have a TON of space to work with
[4:30:56] <jubejube56> If you aren’t going to magic this guy do you want to change your flasks over?
[4:30:57] <xxHungryxx> Also, you can get that frog breath spell btw chat
[4:30:58] <%luftraumm1> hmm maybe his magic is good against him?
[4:31:02] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Had a dungeon with 2 of these guys as a boss
[4:31:11] <+YoruM2> it's so strong
[4:31:14] <+thickshield> that sword is STUPID GOOD
[4:31:15] <+Huderga> sword of night and flame?
[4:31:18] <$Mekhet09> There are a few.
[4:31:19] <Sunstalker> genepark You mean that exact one? They all have their own combos of dragon miracles
[4:31:22] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt that sword of night and flame is possibly the strongest sword in the entire game
[4:31:25] <+Huderga> it's one of the best swords in the game
[4:31:30] <+kewlmyc> Which sword?
[4:31:31] <+mikeygrd> its sooooo busted
[4:31:35] <+lemonlord> which sword?
[4:31:37] <+thickshield> has a death laser move that fucks bosses
[4:31:42] <%bevyrage> night and fire?
[4:31:43] <+kettleroot> youll easily reach level 110 + before getting to the end so splitting your points that much isnt really bad
[4:31:47] <Gray_LoFi> Can't you supplement stats with talismans as well
[4:31:47] <+zaddyforever> i’ve found exactly 2 that use both, i think
[4:31:53] <$Mekhet09> There's another weapon I'd say is better.
[4:31:56] <%linSP> speedrun strats
[4:31:57] <+Huderga> it's actually ridiculous how good it is
[4:31:59] <$Mekhet09> But it's int based.
[4:32:00] <SaltBuster> can I just invest the minimum int and just pump str for that sword?
[4:32:01] <Midnight188> maybe you can kite the dude over to a place you can snipe from?
[4:32:04] <$Surion84> what is the name of the sword
[4:32:04] <rosabellamelantha> Its death lazer is legit stronger than the spell version you get at endgame
[4:32:04] <penitentpendant> Speedruns of this game will be fun
[4:32:04] <%genepark> Yes so far is good. Pair with talisman that lowers FP cost for skills and it’s god tier
[4:32:04] <it_came_from_outer_space> Oh yea theres so much stuff you can just go pick up right away
[4:32:05] <Heyestus> See that sword? you can go there
[4:32:11] <+badhaye> whats the sword?
[4:32:14] <+Nomenanza> which sword is that?
[4:32:17] <+mikeygrd> it feels like im cheating using it
[4:32:18] <+dudlerand> what sword are we talking about?
[4:32:19] <%Undenizen> dude i can't WAIT to see speedruns of this game
[4:32:23] <Sunstalker> One of these dropped a sword for me that was a Ultra Greatsword that's just a piece of ruble that fell from the sky. it's the weirdest sword. Just like a piece of a building
[4:32:25] <sirrice77> sword of night and flame
[4:32:26] <ebrion> Magma jump
[4:32:34] <%genepark> Yep when I found it I was like you can BEELINE to here
[4:32:49] <%Brassnarwhal> @genepark where is it?
[4:32:53] <%Valdorick> Wombo'd
[4:32:54] <rosabellamelantha> also no you NEED to pump at least 2 of its 3 stats for it to have max effectiveness so STR/INT or STR/FTH or INT/FTH
[4:33:01] <ape_hawk> i believe in you, pat
[4:33:03] <+alphonseisbest> Comboed
[4:33:07] <%NopeBadguy> maybe take a break and feed gief?
[4:33:10] <$Surion84> which sword pat?
[4:33:15] <sirrice77> @Sunstalker found that one too bad big weapons are bad
[4:33:15] <%genepark> I thought initially the fp cost is too high but it’s not bad and it gets ridiculous with that talisman
[4:33:19] <+Nomenanza> really? Seemed kinda meh to me when I picked it up
[4:33:23] <%Brassnarwhal> oh sick i can get there ez thanks pat
[4:33:23] <sirrice77> @Surion84 sword of night and flame
[4:33:27] <%linSP> how long did pat take to beat the the gaol'd crucible knight
[4:33:32] <Heyestus> A Faster weapon might be better. You take a lot of your hits while recovering from swings
[4:33:42] <$Mekhet09> You're going to be a glass canon anyway.
[4:33:45] <%justcallmebobplease> OR just grind your ass off and be everything
[4:33:47] <%linSP> saaaame
[4:33:52] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Yeah he's hard as shit if you don't level
[4:33:52] <KasiCrafter> Just don't get hit 4Head
[4:33:53] <+Resderp> The Stormvale evergaol?
[4:33:54] <x2Twistedx> dude took me 4hrs
[4:33:57] <doster504> everything 2 shots you in this game anyways you can't not be a glass cannon
[4:34:01] <doster504> kind of sick of it
[4:34:02] <%genepark> Int and faith and yes I have no hp lmao
[4:34:08] <$OfficerMods> not me i didn't update anything but vit end str and dex and just only used the bloodhound edge
[4:34:10] <%Valdorick> I imagine its why Magrit is gives problems. People pump damage over survivability and then he just trucks them.
[4:34:12] <%boggsz12> i started power stancing with bloodhound's fang and the dismounter and kicked his ass with jump attacks
[4:34:12] <%luftraumm1> do you feel pressured to clear difficulty
[4:34:15] <$OfficerMods> hyper armor on that weapon rules
[4:34:16] <+Huderga> there is not not being a glass cannon in this game
[4:34:20] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Bullrushing Mines and then stacking health and stamina seems to be the optimal boss fighting route
[4:34:22] <%Kevlar_Caviar> like usual??
[4:34:25] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I was like 180 by the end
[4:34:34] <Gav_EXE> Soft-cap is 40, right?
[4:34:34] <%Valdorick> Spell casting soft cap ends at 60 points.
[4:34:36] <+LandOfTheWay> people are talking about 120 as the pvp level from what i've seen
[4:34:37] <%PrimalDweeb> 12 str 12 dex 24 int 24 faith are the min stats
[4:34:37] <+zaddyforever> 15 vig and 45 int has been getting me thru most everything except rykard and radahn so far
[4:34:39] <rosabellamelantha> the soft cap for int is 70 this game
[4:34:42] <rosabellamelantha> hard cap*
[4:34:46] <%xcompleasedad> Are there soft caps at all?
[4:34:46] <%Valdorick> But the highest faith spell in the game is 50, and the highest int spell is 70
[4:34:52] <%genepark> Yes soft caps seem around 50-60
[4:34:53] <Sunstalker> I think fromsoft just expects people to wait until they have maxed weapons for a lot of this. Which I have not had the patience for, I just keep tackling stuff until it works
[4:34:59] <rosabellamelantha> 70 for a cap is absurd
[4:35:01] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> i think the soft cap its at 60 or something
[4:35:05] <+zaddyforever> best int staffs are 60
[4:35:07] <+Ravenrooke> @PatStaresAt and chat, this is my first Souls game and leveling is a bit overwhelming, I am not sure how to go about spending my points. Any advice is appreciated!
[4:35:07] <%slrls_> why does he grow a sack before fire breath
[4:35:08] <zecaptain_james> this knight is so cool dam
[4:35:09] <%Undenizen> is that an... egg?
[4:35:12] <%genepark> So meta pvp is landing around 150 now
[4:35:17] <ohno58> Here comes anime
[4:35:20] <+Edrem> having gear and great runes increases stats really helps hit the higher caps
[4:35:21] <+leviting> those wings are ridiculously cool
[4:35:26] <%linSP> whats the spell that takes like 90 int
[4:35:35] <%genepark> Dmc4 ass enemy
[4:35:35] <+zaddyforever> but there’s also a helmet that boosts int by 6
[4:35:37] <%Deft_Thought> @zecaptain_james I think it's supposed to be like a frog's throat
[4:35:43] <%Brassnarwhal> HOW MANY NEW MOVES DOES HE HAVE
[4:35:46] <+Huderga> @linSP the moon attack and it's 70 int
[4:35:46] <%jamsbybetty> @linSP you throw the moon at someone
[4:35:46] <Midnight188> 60 and its the moon spell iirc
[4:35:50] <Sunstalker> I know HP softcaps at 40. it drops from like 50 hp to 28 hp increase
[4:35:51] <%Zundelle> the funny thing about these knights is my favorite way of dealing with them is the crucible tail you get from the first one
[4:35:59] <%Brassnarwhal> do ew even know this matchup at all?
[4:36:07] <%linSP> @Huderga @jamsbybetty that's pretty based and worth it sounding
[4:36:11] <%Valdorick> Its 70 int, and its full moon.
[4:36:15] <%ChrisPlaysThing> The bringer of poo Kappa
[4:36:27] <r0flwaffles> these are much tougher than black knights
[4:36:28] <+wotn_weisskaiser> You can easily bait them into big AOE stuff like the tail or Radahn's sword yeah
[4:36:30] <%jamsbybetty> @linSP I saw someone two-shot Godrick with it!
[4:36:31] <%luftraumm1> jump over it?
[4:36:31] <+zaddyforever> @midnight188 there’s actually two 60 int spells i’ve found so far
[4:36:33] <%Brassnarwhal> gotta go through not back
[4:36:37] <+crocodile_t34rz> Oh how I hated this dude in the evergaol
[4:36:39] <+Huderga> @linSP tmk no one uses it, they get the lazer and call it a day
[4:36:45] <Midnight188> @zaddyforever :O
[4:36:46] <KasiCrafter> I thought you were supposed to roll into the wings, not WITH them?
[4:36:48] <+pectusumbra> If you're close it seems side dodges work better for the flame as much as the flying dash
[4:36:51] <FeralFozzie> or hate food from the old ball and chain?
[4:36:53] <sirrice77> @Ravenrooke Dont neglect vigor so you arent one shot, if you want heavy armor pump endurance till you can wear what you want, level str and dex enough to equip whatever weapon you really really like and picking either int or faith depending on which you like
[4:36:56] <+marlborored5> maybe rolling towards him during flame attacks would be better
[4:36:56] <%NopeBadguy> oh lmao
[4:36:57] <%Valdorick> Don't choke
[4:36:57] <%sniffy77> YAY

[4:38:28] <+Ravenrooke> @Ravenrooke Thank you so much! Would you recommend that I level up Vigor/Endurance when I dont have a weapon im working towards?
[4:38:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> I thought they were buffalo wings?
[4:38:37] <+TheBitingIrish> Wish the physick got a third slot
[4:38:51] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I did not read that As Cluck at first
[4:38:53] <%Brassnarwhal> @happythetic i think of this as a tease of whats to come rather than the later stuff being reused
[4:38:53] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @Ranryu692 more like PatCucksAt, ha gottem
[4:39:49] <xxHungryxx> Welp gotta run. Cya folks 👋
[4:39:49] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @TurtlesAndTentacles me neither Kappa
[4:39:59] <@Ranryu692> @ChrisPlaysThing nice
[4:40:11] <$OfficerMods> hey did anyone else here fall off THAT pot and lose all their runes?
[4:40:12] <sirrice77> @Ravenrooke Aim to get to 25-30 vigor at some point , endurance have JUST enough to wear what you like and have enough for your weapons and shield. If you have nothing to work towards then yeah pump those but honestly if you're gonna use spells/incantations you'll have to put a fair amount of points into those
[4:41:26] <+laserchainsaws> Is this the break or the start of stream
[4:41:38] <sirrice77> break, hes eating wangs
[4:41:53] <+laserchainsaws> Hell yeah
[4:42:05] <Midnight188> so four belfries is just a preview of a zone with a hard enemy to fight
[4:42:08] <+rbakervv> @laserchainsaws he beat a tough mob, got no loot, and stopped to eat food
[4:42:16] <+Ravenrooke> @Ravenrooke Okay! Thank you very much! I truly appreciate your time and advice!
[4:43:12] <+SinisterBroccoli> hey I'm planning to use Eleanores pole blade. is it broken from the arcane bug?
[4:43:43] <+laserchainsaws> Did pat ever kill gostoc in stormveil or did he let him live
[4:43:48] <sirrice77> @Ravenrooke No problem, and if you wanna use spirit summons then you need to pump mind as well, also if you want spells/incants of course so i would say 20 is a good enough stat for mind if you wanna use those things. Also good for weapon arts some of which are VERY strong and shouldn't be neglected
[4:45:04] <monzy101> rip
[4:45:11] <+Ravenrooke> Ohh got it. Maybe I will go for a sword + magic build
[4:47:58] <%MaybeFalco> MaybeFalco subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! yo pat, if you ever feel like needing to cheese the gargoyle in dragonbarrow, you can lose aggro by sitting in the back of the sanctum, and he'll reset after a minute but his health will stay the same. i also recommend getting more vigor for fighting radahn, most of his attacks will probably one shot you right now.
[4:48:29] <+supersonic21> I managed to beat radahn last night. I popped off hard
[4:49:09] <sirrice77> @Ravenrooke a lot of magic leaning weapons lean on dex more than str but remember you can just use a non-unique weapon and put a magic weapon art on it to scale it to magic. If you need those theres some in stormveil castle from an npc but its pretty deep in there, might be some easily available elsewhere
[4:49:34] <%MaybeFalco> its such a bullshit fight to be honest, but i guess you're not supposed to take it on as soon as most people do
[4:49:56] <+supersonic21> Duel rapiers is fun
[4:50:05] <+supersonic21> Roigers rapier is really good
[4:50:20] <+nayre> Dual curved greatswords is awesome :D
[4:50:21] <+zaddyforever> it seems really easy to rush radahn, but i heard him called starscourge n immediately decided for later
[4:50:31] <+zaddyforever> rush as in, jump in to early
[4:50:34] <+zaddyforever> too
[4:50:35] <+Ravenrooke> is there a good character to start with for that? I started as Vagabond and i dont think im really liking it so far.
[4:51:02] <+supersonic21> Aparentlly if you rush radhan it makes getting to him a pain in the ass
[4:51:05] <+pupil31> I'm close to end game and I'm still using Carian Slicer
[4:51:05] <%mornerboi> @zaddyforever yeah he's probably easy to rush to, but god I can't imagine fighting him low level.
[4:51:15] <+The_EL_Destino> anyone wanna play rock,paper scissors?
[4:51:15] <%thugnasty117> I started as samurai and just found the uchi bouts to go ham haha
[4:51:21] <sirrice77> @Ravenrooke Prisoner aka griffith i think. He has high dex and int. Starts with an estoc and spells
[4:51:44] <%MaybeFalco> @supersonic21 yeah if you don't wait for the festival, you have to do the whole gauntlet
[4:51:45] <+Ravenrooke> Ill try that then! Thank you!
[4:51:51] <+supersonic21> I’m kinda sad I can’t find any of those samurai straw hats anywhere so far

[4:59:02] <+Slice_of_Kris> they run the salt mine not surprizing they are up here
[4:59:03] <VirtuaRailith> You inherited Paige's witch curse when you proposed to her. Curses are shared between spouces

[4:59:11] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I thought I had hit a stride and was becoming op after struggling for so long, then I hit the north section of the map and was wonderfully shown that fromsoft can actually make a hard late game that you can't just beat with a maxed out weapon
[4:59:12] <NewWillinium> Ugh these fuckers. I ran into them an hour ago for the first time and I **hate**
[4:59:14] <digaogrunge> RED DUDE SAID THEY WORSHIP HER

[5:04:56] <+Shimano232> It sook me forever to figure out that statue, but it did lead me to another secret I wouldn't have found otherwise so worth it I guess.
[5:04:59] <%Brassnarwhal> @zaddyforever and marica
[5:05:06] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> fuck that guy
[5:05:07] <+Nomenanza> it's that dog guy
[5:05:12] <SuperInhuman> this kinda looks like brutal legends
[5:05:14] <%MaybeFalco> its the one guy
[5:05:21] <%thbluewarden> thbluewarden is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 3 in the channel! 
[5:05:22] <%thbluewarden> thbluewarden gifted a Tier 1 sub to geekjacob! 
[5:05:24] <%Brassnarwhal> psa1guy
[5:05:36] <jubejube56> Ah right and Mallina was the blade of miquela and then the blood person from last stream mention miquela in the egg
[5:05:37] <Guardiansaiyan> nice
[5:05:42] <%Bluwizard21> He a big boi don't need no pots
[5:05:43] <jubejube56> oh this is all nice and confusing
[5:05:52] <deviljhojho_> he looks like a piece of jerky my dog threw up once
[5:05:55] <%linSP> its the sens fortress giant asshole who throse balls at you
[5:06:03] <+Shimano232> Have you found the death bird just below this cliff yet?
[5:06:13] <Sunstalker> It's pretty sad that not a single one of these trolls ever has a good drop. They're just window dressing challenges for some minor rune gain
[5:06:14] <+TheBitingIrish> The brass shield has no right being that damn good
[5:06:16] <fierysnowflakes> LUL
[5:06:18] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> truly awful
[5:06:23] <deviljhojho_> place is a damned shithole
[5:06:23] <+eanscrale> It has so much great shit in it, I hate it
[5:06:23] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Head north it gets worse
[5:06:29] <$OfficerMods> cool festivals though
[5:06:32] <SaltBuster> this place is great
[5:06:33] <%nanaki_ff14> Calid rules. Im starting to love it my 3rd day here lol
[5:06:38] <XxMoliciousxX> lol understatement of the year
[5:06:39] <peachy996> This place is a beautiful land
[5:06:42] <%Brassnarwhal> @sunstalker the troll greatswords are pretty good and one has a weapon art
[5:06:43] <%Valdorick> Welcome to the fuckbridge
[5:06:44] <kinkade_77> rot incantation seems kinda bad
[5:06:44] <$zyberion626> 1/5
[5:06:49] <peachy996> It's inhabitants kind
[5:06:57] <+hakumaribo> imo i think the beast spells are better then the dragon ones. they cost less and they hit super hard the claw and rock throw have let me one shot invaders
[5:06:57] <sirrice77> @Sunstalker but some of them drops unique swords
[5:06:57] <%Valdorick> When I came through, this was COVERED in bloodstains
[5:06:59] <Sunstalker> Hey man, it's better then Blighttown. This place has a road for one.
[5:07:06] <+KipTheSmuggler> caelid is for the dogs
[5:07:06] <%Brassnarwhal> @kinkade_77 it's really good
[5:07:09] <+zaddyforever> @jubejube56 yeah, mohg, who mentions mohgwyn. honestly feel like elden ring is a bit of a dark souls prequel. the names godwyn and mohgwyn are way too suspicious
[5:07:13] <deviljhojho_> rot incantation is for bosses i've heard
[5:07:14] <RustyQuarters> Priscilla would LOVE it here @peachy996
[5:07:16] <deviljhojho_> and its a real killer
[5:07:16] <%The_Protagonist> oh he went invisible

[5:08:04] <SaltBuster> this place is great. it has multiple Burger Kings.
[5:08:05] <%justcallmebobplease> So is Radahn the Fromsoft version of Lu Bu?  Because that's what he seems like.

[5:08:29] <%Brassnarwhal> @sunstalker no, i got 2 troll greatswords, one from in caria manor one from the headless gold one wandering around somewhere, the weapon art was from one in limgrave i think
[5:08:29] <%ElkRiverDog> Spicy wings became spicy bunghole
[5:08:33] <sirrice77> @Sunstalker Uh not really, if its a troll with a sword then try it. One of the magic trolls drops a sword and one in the atlus area drops one i think
[5:08:36] <+hakumaribo> @sirrice77 i put most of my points into, int, mind and faith
[5:08:42] <~PatStaresAt> now I know how Johnny sasaski feels

[5:19:21] <rommlll> what a bro
[5:19:21] <+Shimano232> Pat, there are 2 night bosses just down the road from you if your interested.
[5:19:22] <+LandOfTheWay> keep talking to him, i think
[5:19:23] <%Undenizen> i feel like you should murder this man as a precaution.
[5:19:27] <+Edrem> if he sells the rot spell you can get extra information from him
[5:19:31] <+Nomenanza> oh no Radahn
[5:19:33] <Zourath> Night Maiden's Mist bypasses most defenses and immunities, it's stupidly good.
[5:19:37] <%JustToWatch> I would do North first
[5:19:39] <%tyler274> Radahn or Atlus take your pick
[5:19:42] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Rodan.
[5:19:43] <%luftraumm1> nah go check the rest of the zone out
[5:19:43] <+pectusumbra> That's sad commentary

[5:20:13] <%Brassnarwhal> her mom is the badass with the robot arm
[5:20:14] <binku_muja_> Dudes' like, "She has a destiny!" while also insulting her ass at the same time.
[5:20:15] <%MaybeFalco> you cant yet
[5:20:15] <%whyskeywolfe> It's to do with Radahn
[5:20:15] <+Shimano232> that whole this is off limits
[5:20:16] <%justcallmebobplease> Is he talking about an invader?  I killed an invader with that name somewhere, does that mean he'd be pissed at me if I ran into him?  Anyone know?
[5:20:18] <femto216> The map-uh
[5:20:18] <%Brassnarwhal> bro
[5:20:20] <Saltmeisterr> @cade_calrayn Malenia ye

[5:20:20] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Is she Valyrie ladies daughter?
[5:20:20] <%cade_calrayn> This is the one-armed Valkyrie lady's daughter?!
[5:20:20] <godlesscruelty> dont worry about the big open area
[5:20:23] <CH3F015> you cant
[5:20:27] <%MaybeFalco> oh yeah knight cavalry by the rot dragon
[5:20:29] <Sigma_190_Beta> IS SHE THE DAUGHTER OF THAT BADASS ROBOT WOMAN?
[5:20:30] <+Shimano232> both bosses are right around this grace
[5:20:31] <%cade_calrayn> Also you're right, you can't reach that part
[5:20:37] <+alphonseisbest> @justcallmebobplease NPC
[5:20:41] <%Undenizen> so far i haven't found anywhere i can't go
[5:20:44] <%cade_calrayn> T-shaped intersection south of the swamp
[5:20:46] <%zarkazeon> big patch to the right I'd inaccessible till radahn
[5:20:48] <Khester824> right next to you
[5:20:52] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt night cavalry in the south road, another bell bearer in the merchant shack at night
[5:20:53] <%zarkazeon> is*
[5:20:57] <+alphonseisbest> @Sigma_190_Beta RIGHT SHE COULD BE THAT BE DOPE
[5:20:59] <+Shimano232> the other is just up the hill towards the roll that was throwing pots
[5:21:00] <%cade_calrayn> Right down the road Pat
[5:21:01] <%Brassnarwhal> below the giant on the cliff someone said
[5:21:03] <%MaybeFalco> he was literally just down the road lmao
[5:21:03] <%cade_calrayn> You just saw him
[5:21:04] <Sigma_190_Beta> Pat, it was right down the road.
[5:21:08] <jubejube56> it's on the road isn't it?
[5:21:10] <+tizziks> Did you ever go south of the vendor?  You teleported to Radahn
[5:21:10] <%justcallmebobplease> @alphonseisbest Okay, so killing the invader form of that NPC does nothing quest-wise, is that what it looks like?
[5:21:13] <Khester824> on cliff side
[5:21:19] <Sigma_190_Beta> The Night calvelry was just there.
[5:21:39] <jubejube56> 2 rotted for the price of 1
[5:21:41] <+alphonseisbest> @alphonseisbest SEEMS like yea, pat also killed that npc and did the quest fine
[5:21:42] <%Valdorick> Is that a fucking Cat-O-Nine Flails!?
[5:21:47] <+Grayhammatter> wow, that's busted AF
[5:22:02] <%MaybeFalco> if you run away he'll keep taking damage im pretty sure
[5:22:05] <+Nomenanza> that body check is so dumb sometimes
[5:22:08] <%Undenizen> so did GRRM invent "the night's cavalry"?
[5:22:13] <%Broand> you hit em with the red goo? you got a red goo miracle too?
[5:22:14] <%boggsz12> is this the first time he's fought Night's cavalry?
[5:22:19] <%Undenizen> it's kinda close to something else
[5:22:31] <%justcallmebobplease> @alphonseisbest fantastic, I'm trying very hard to explore all over this game without triggering anything.
[5:22:33] <%Brassnarwhal> @undenizen nah tolkien dis theyre called ring wraiths
[5:22:34] <%Valdorick> Its a strong toxic AND increases damage you deal
[5:22:37] <%Valdorick> its so busted
[5:22:38] <AgnusLaplace> lul, the horse can plesioth hip check
[5:22:39] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[5:22:44] <$Mekhet09> I'm so disappointed right now I just found out that you get hard locked trying to do a maiden less run. I just restarted my character because I wanted to see if that was a bug.
[5:22:51] <+Shimano232> across the street
[5:22:54] <+Grayhammatter> fucking easy shit
[5:22:55] <%Undenizen> eyy the horsie lived.
[5:23:01] <+alphonseisbest> @justcallmebobplease  nah i get that, im doing the same
[5:23:02] <Sunstalker> Now you have poison affinity for any weapon
[5:23:11] <Khester824> to your right on the cliff
[5:23:16] <%watts121> rot &bleed are op
[5:23:22] <%Broand> Wha
[5:23:26] <%Brassnarwhal> dragun
[5:23:26] <%Broand> poison is faith too?
[5:23:26] <neet98> how is caelid treating you?
[5:23:54] <%Brassnarwhal> @broand poison was pyromancy so it got to ride into faith
[5:24:03] <Sunstalker> Bloodflame on a bleed weapon boosted with bleed affinity. WAYTOODANK
[5:24:13] <%Broand> You know for a bunch of sorcerers, all they seem to care about is how to make blue lights go fast
[5:24:16] <+Shimano232> should almost see it from the grace. towards the cliff with the troll on it.
[5:24:16] <+tizziks> Seems everything except arcare stuff is faith now
[5:24:40] <sirrice77> isolated merchant shack
[5:24:47] <+Shimano232> you haven't seen that one yet.should almost see it from the grace. towards the cliff with the troll on it.
[5:24:51] <+pectusumbra> ice is also sorcery in this apparently
[5:24:54] <+KipTheSmuggler> Pat do u know ur current hours on this file
[5:24:55] <Khester824> directly behind you on the cliff
[5:24:55] <Sunstalker> It's up in the unexplored part
[5:25:00] <+pectusumbra> and there's that night mist stuff seems cool
[5:25:00] <blue8moon> it's north
[5:25:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's in the part of the map you don't have yet
[5:25:03] <+Shimano232> south from the grace
[5:25:03] <%watts121> my next char will be dragon priest
[5:25:23] <+Shimano232> there are 3 in this zone, 1 is in the un explored
[5:25:26] <Khester824> north east rn
[5:25:29] <%Brassnarwhal> @tizziks magic got some new schools too it seems pretty balanced, luck determines which each individual sees more though
[5:25:31] <ape_hawk> @pectusumbra it makes sense, since sorcery is based on space magic and its pretty cold in space
[5:25:32] <Sunstalker> It's on the right side of the cliffs that the siofra well comes out at
[5:25:32] <+LandOfTheWay> @PatStaresAt just as a heads up, millicent's gonna be traveling around now and continuing her quest will require finding her. using a guide is probably your best bet cause there's a lot of places from what i've looked up
[5:25:49] <+Shimano232> there is 1 right next to the grace you were just at. south from the grace.
[5:25:49] <Sunstalker> But you have to go around from the east
[5:26:01] <%Bluwizard21> bedtime in 30 minutes
[5:26:07] <Sunstalker> You can find a airpad for Torren north of the Plague church
[5:26:07] <+pectusumbra> If I ever play this I'm just gonna try to go arch mage and just get as much spell on as I can
[5:26:09] <+KipTheSmuggler> ur fantasy twitter be poppin off
[5:26:24] <+LandOfTheWay> ooh, magic hammer time
[5:26:30] <NewWillinium> You've found the rare and illusive Strength Mage Build
[5:26:34] <Sunstalker> Yeah right here you're close
[5:26:35] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt hit the mountain behind that wizard guy
[5:26:35] <%kujofire990> CLUB MAGE

[5:27:25] <%epide> the  hell were is that
[5:27:25] <%Brassnarwhal> *SCREAMING*
[5:27:41] <ape_hawk> we thought that swamps were going to be the worst thing in this game. turns out, its bullshit illusionary walls...
[5:27:41] <%luftraumm1> no message for the hidden passage?
[5:27:43] <%PrimalDweeb> Also, fuck that illusory wall.
[5:27:45] <jubejube56> Hug and hit every wall
[5:27:46] <%sniffy77> they're unique enough to be good
[5:27:46] <Sunstalker> Just enough copypasted that you know which types get you what types of rewards mostly.
[5:27:48] <jubejube56> there is no other option
[5:27:50] <%MaybeFalco> okay that illusory wall actually makes me fucking upset
[5:27:51] <%Monkeyweed21> I found a cave with over 10 illusory walls in it
[5:28:07] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> They're way less shit feeling than chalices
[5:28:12] <%watts121> wait does he have quest key?
[5:28:13] <%furiousfurioso> and then sometimes you think it'll be copy pasted and you wind up in the ant tunnel to cthulhu land
[5:28:14] <+Shimano232> this one has a few
[5:28:20] <$Mekhet09> hit front.
[5:28:20] <peachy996> At least these dungeons have enough of a ramp up than Chalices
[5:28:24] <+Nomenanza> nah I think I know which one they talking about. It is in Atlus plateau
[5:28:31] <%MaybeFalco> there's another one with a lot of walls in it
[5:28:31] <pi_in_the_sci> You can hear them working, is the clue
[5:28:32] <%barrakuta371> wtf
[5:28:45] <%Valdorick> Wow, eat shit
[5:28:45] <+pectusumbra> How's it going SSEATH?
[5:28:46] <Sunstalker> But what if it was purple?
[5:28:46] <peachy996> With Chalices you have to do a whole bunch before you find that one memorably tough chalice with the red spiders
[5:28:49] <bassoontyphoon> Why is pat killing all of these minors
[5:28:50] <%MaybeFalco> LUL
[5:28:50] <%notsoy> LMFAO
[5:28:51] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt this place is important to a questline btw, uh do you want me to tell you of another illusion someplace you have already been that is important to that same questline? I don't wanna backseat you so hard but like its easy to miss
[5:28:51] <%bruuzer12> Where the fuck is that wall? can you show the map?
[5:28:51] <%PrimalDweeb> Damn

[5:28:54] <AlexJacobVO> I love that when you backstab those guys you get a mix of the flame and the arcane crystal particle effects. That shit looks dope
[5:28:54] <lethallylactic> LUL
[5:28:59] <%Brassnarwhal> can't wait for illusory ceilings that hide switches that uncover hidden floor doors
[5:29:00] <%Pookiedaexzile> Wizard Duel

[5:31:35] <Sunstalker> Seath really was a bitch, these snails can use crystal magic even
[5:31:36] <SaltBuster> if you thought that spell was crazy. they have some crazy stuff later
[5:31:41] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> 21 i think
[5:31:47] <overlord_nico> Crystal snails?! That’s a nightmare for me...

[5:32:01] <%MaybeFalco> its the little crystal consumables that use FP i think
[5:32:03] <+The_EL_Destino> When you were partying  I studied The Blade  When you were having premarital sex  I mastered The Blockchain  While you wasted your days at the gym in pursuit of vanity  I cultivated Inner Strength  And now that the world is on fire and the barbarians are at the gate you have the audacity to come to me for help?

[5:34:06] <%PrimalDweeb> Don't worry, I'm sure most of us are too.
[5:34:06] <+hakumaribo> honestly if so many people want to keep leaving troll messages they should just have thier hp cut in half if you rate it poor
[5:34:07] <Undenizen> go towards the enemies, pat!
[5:34:07] <jubejube56> Wait they just put those ashes in a chest?!
[5:34:21] <Parapattern> They're so cute!
[5:34:33] <+Grayhammatter> crystal snails?
[5:34:35] <%Valdorick> @hakumaribo That would just lead to the same kind of person who makes those messages going around down voting everyone's message.
[5:34:44] <Zourath> One of these days Fromsoft will just make a whole illusory castle. Floor, wall, ceiling, everything is an illusion. Under the illusion? Poison swamp.

[5:35:51] <%Valdorick> You boot up the newest Fromsoft game. You look around after character creation. You take a swing to test controls. *The game quits out, the entire game was an illusionary wall*
[5:35:52] <blue8moon> I'd be down for sci-fi souls

[5:36:22] <+Nomenanza> yeah that IS chalice dungeon levels of bs
[5:36:23] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt FYI Parries destroy crystal dudes
[5:36:24] <%whyskeywolfe> Look out, Pat!
[5:36:25] <Sigma_190_Beta> Oleg is not good for this fight I guess.
[5:36:25] <%Puhff> oof

[5:36:38] <MidnightPacif1c> oleg getting the rot tonight FeelsBadMan
[5:36:48] <%greasypete00> how many flasks do you think is the total? 20?
[5:36:50] <%TaurusOxford> Boss run initiated!
[5:36:52] <SaltBuster> armored core souls let's gooo
[5:36:58] <AlexJacobVO> OK so hissing snails sound like a nightmare.
[5:36:58] <+Grayhammatter> some stakes seems to be a little busted
[5:37:01] <Sigma_190_Beta> I'd say that @PatStaresAt you should summon the Raya Lucaria trio rather than anything else.
[5:37:06] <jubejube56> Yeah the scarlet rot part is just icing on the cake
[5:37:10] <%boggsz12> damn, i was watching someone attempt this yesterday and the marika statue was not working for them
[5:37:15] <+zaddyforever> crystallians always have shitty runs
[5:37:18] <enddword> PINWHEEL BatChest
[5:37:21] <+TheBitingIrish> Jump attack these fucks, Pat
[5:37:22] <%Valdorick> Oleg, get in there and pull aggro!
[5:37:27] <%TaurusOxford> Oleg is doing NOTHING to them
[5:37:30] <+Grayhammatter> oh fuck THIS
[5:37:30] <+crocodile_t34rz> WHY, FROM?!
[5:37:31] <+nayre> wtf is this shit
[5:37:31] <+anoldtoilet> lol
[5:37:32] <+Akizea> need some bludgeoning
[5:37:33] <+NeonFishFace> nope
[5:37:34] <+anoldtoilet> damn
[5:37:35] <+zaddyforever> oleg pls help
[5:37:35] <AlexJacobVO> And you deal no damage to them?
[5:37:37] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> You gotta cleanse between swings it seems
[5:37:37] <lethallylactic> Yeah strike damage is pretty much your best bet
[5:37:37] <+anoldtoilet> now this is a boss
[5:37:38] <%timsellart> F
[5:37:38] <AlexJacobVO> What the fuck?
[5:37:40] <Xiangchang> Blunt weapons work on them, sadly.
[5:37:40] <+sambws> Gotta crit em
[5:37:40] <+ScrapKingKeita> do you have a blunt weapon?
[5:37:41] <SaltBuster> SPEEEEEN
[5:37:42] <@QueequegTheater> Get a blunt weapon
[5:37:42] <%delilah4you> OH yeah but a bashing weapon wil fuck them up
[5:37:42] <blue8moon> fuuuuuuuuuuuck
[5:37:43] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> time for bonk
[5:37:43] <%greasypete00> even oleg is powerless against them
[5:37:44] <+LandOfTheWay> you, uh, might want to use bludgeoning weapons
[5:37:44] <Sunstalker> God, there has to be something they're weak to, this is not normal dmg
[5:37:45] <%Valdorick> I beat these guys last night, and they are not fun
[5:37:47] <%PrimalDweeb> Damn, you ain't doing no damage to them.
[5:37:47] <%luftraumm1> this is stupid
[5:37:48] <+pectusumbra> these things always have that super armor until you do enough to them
[5:37:49] <@PrefectusCorgi> Did like noi damge at all
[5:37:49] <femto216> Fuck off
[5:37:49] <@Ranryu692> now this is pod racing
[5:37:49] <%TaurusOxford> Oleg was doing literal single digit damage
[5:37:50] <%delilah4you> Just go by a hammer lol
[5:37:51] <+anoldtoilet> you need to break crystalians super armor first
[5:37:51] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Maybe grab like the Raya Lucarian soldiers than Oleg?
[5:37:52] <+LandOfTheWay> well then get fucked i guess
[5:37:53] <koolkid1208> @PatStaresAt you need a blunt weapon
[5:37:53] <$realm_forge> OLEG NOOOOO
[5:37:54] <AlexJacobVO> psaWhat psaWhat psaWhat psaWhat psaWhat psaWhat
[5:37:55] <fierysnowflakes> Welcome to NOPE, the boss fight
[5:37:55] <%Valdorick> I think your Weapon Art is a strike attack?
[5:37:56] <+sambws> If you can crit you'll do more damage afterwards
[5:37:58] <Midnight188> blender boss strong
[5:37:59] <Sunstalker> I bet the literal Pickaxe is good on them
[5:38:00] <ape_hawk> @AlexJacobVO you have to break their poise and they become hella weaker
[5:38:01] <%delilah4you> Or use the mace you got at the beginning of the game
[5:38:02] <+TheBitingIrish> You gotta jump/charge attack, then finisher them
[5:38:03] <%greasypete00> i think pierce also works on them
[5:38:03] <+crocodile_t34rz> Time to diversify your portfolio
[5:38:04] <+jennyfurific> if you dont have strike damage you kinda just gotta hit em enough to stagger them
[5:38:04] <doster504> you have to stagger them it cracks their bod
[5:38:05] <%MaybeFalco> rot?
[5:38:08] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> uh oh pat has an idea
[5:38:09] <it_came_from_outer_space> @PatStaresAt even an unupgraded blunt weapon will do better than a +10 curved sword
[5:38:10] <Saltmeisterr> weren't these gues weak to lighting?
[5:38:10] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> They need to be posture broken to deal real damage
[5:38:12] <+Shimano232> once you broken posture on them and crit they take WAY more damage after.
[5:38:12] <%delilah4you> I GOT A BLUNT...
[5:38:13] <it_came_from_outer_space> not joking
[5:38:14] <%delilah4you> weapon
[5:38:15] <%PrimalDweeb> Blunt up bitch
[5:38:18] <TheBlankAce> You just need to keep hitting them until they crack, your weapon is fine
[5:38:18] <GenericTwitchAcc1> you'll do more damage to them once you posture break them once
[5:38:22] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Arent you sttong?
[5:38:27] <%cade_calrayn> Pat the proper reply is "I have one, it's my dick"
[5:38:35] <Sunstalker> A multi ash summon seems good
[5:38:39] <Ghufufin> have u tried hitting them harder?
[5:38:40] <%UltraViolet371> I AOE DOT'd them down with pestilent mercury lol
[5:39:00] <%cascadepersona> From Software were really on poiny when they named these bosses "Putrid"
[5:39:06] <SaltBuster> spear man jumps funny
[5:39:06] <%Brassnarwhal> critical hits shatter them like strike damage, so whatever you need to get a crit
[5:39:09] <KingKZ> No damage at all
[5:39:19] <AlexJacobVO> Duuuuuuude
[5:39:22] <%AutomatedSquid> this looks infuriating
[5:39:22] <jubejube56> Jumpy spear man needs to chill
[5:39:30] <%PrimalDweeb> Oh?
[5:39:30] <%sniffy77> This is a goddamn clownhouse
[5:39:31] <%TaurusOxford> Oh this looks awful
[5:39:33] <femto216> Your runes
[5:39:34] <@Fuggins4U> this does not look fun
[5:39:37] <digaogrunge> kill the spear first
[5:39:40] <+nayre> 3 bosses just looks like complete shit
[5:39:42] <Sunstalker> You got any stun oriented ash summons?
[5:39:42] <femto216> Gone
[5:39:43] <%luftraumm1> you got some other ashes too
[5:39:43] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Seems like Blades do nothing
[5:39:43] <$Mekhet09> you should try to get the spear one and staff one at opposite ends.
[5:39:44] <AlexJacobVO> Jumpy spear man needs to go
[5:39:47] <huskarl_zap> need a hammer or mace
[5:39:48] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> The rot is a little much
[5:39:50] <+ScrapKingKeita> yeah
[5:39:53] <Sigma_190_Beta> You did lose 20K
[5:39:55] <%TaurusOxford> This is Mob Squad 2.0
[5:39:55] <KasiCrafter> Hey wait. Does that Black Hole spell eat their magic BS?
[5:39:55] <blue8moon> yep
[5:39:57] <+anoldtoilet> ruin sentinels but also they spam magic is ftw
[5:39:58] <+anoldtoilet> real fuck you
[5:40:01] <%Broand> the weird thing is that I found a dungeon with these dudes in the plateau but it's LESS hard than this
[5:40:03] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Yes because you keep forgettibg to pick them up
[5:40:05] <%MaybeFalco> powerstancing curved greatswords maybe? for max stagger?
[5:40:07] <mantyz> where is this cave?
[5:40:17] <Midnight188> ruin sentinels but what if they had toxic
[5:40:27] <RyuuAoi> Is Pat big strong again?
[5:40:37] <it_came_from_outer_space> @PatStaresAt also spear boy is easy af to parry
[5:40:37] <@Fuggins4U> that spear dude needs to fuck right off
[5:40:38] <%notsoy> these wombo combos are tough, man
[5:40:40] <RubberFistFight> yo those guys are big strong
[5:40:42] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt The caster needs to die, its spittin aoe on everyone
[5:40:42] <+Pale_Soul> this is the worst boss in the game
[5:40:43] <it_came_from_outer_space> in case you wanted to try that
[5:40:45] <%TaurusOxford> @RyuuAoi nope, back to weak baby.
[5:40:46] <NewWillinium> Pat is Big Strong but weak to striking
[5:40:47] <AlexJacobVO> Ruin Sentinels but if they were more bullshit that before
[5:40:48] <FeralFozzie> alnost got it that time
[5:40:48] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> well designed boss fight :)
[5:40:50] <sirrice77> @mantyz by church of plague near sellia. Gotta go farther up to the graveyard then mountain behind wizard man is an illusion wall
[5:40:52] <%PrimalDweeb> This might be a Co-op fight
[5:40:55] <huskarl_zap> need hammer
[5:40:55] <%PocketBearIllustrator> ok, back to sleep I go. good luck with that boss fight, pat. that looks cheap as fuck
[5:40:56] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I dont think the Soilders are cutting it lol
[5:40:57] <KasiCrafter> The hard part is getting ONE of them down
[5:40:59] <pi_in_the_sci> you probably have a parry ash
[5:40:59] <Sunstalker> Barehand is parry, if you wanted too
[5:41:00] <jubejube56> I mean honestly idek how you are supposed to beat that spear one without parry
[5:41:02] <%Broand> Bosses which are like multiple dudes are the worst
[5:41:06] <jubejube56> seems like it just keeps going
[5:41:16] <Sunstalker> Spear fucker seems like priority
[5:41:23] <%Axellogic> I just put barricade on a greatsheild and they get fucked by the deflect and guard counters
[5:41:25] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> yeah if you could just get that spear guy
[5:41:31] <IminyourBase> just gangbang whichever one your boys jump on
[5:41:33] <%MaybeFalco> yeah there's another dungeon with 2, and it's relatively easy, however they didn't have rot on top of it
[5:41:34] <+zaddyforever> even two of them had me rock slinging for my life
[5:41:37] <Sunstalker> So parries or guard counters with strike dmg?
[5:41:39] <AlexJacobVO> Spell chucker may need to go first methinks...
[5:41:43] <+zaddyforever> three with scarlet eot is nuts
[5:41:44] <%TaurusOxford> @Sunstalker you say that as the other one is just spamming spread shot at Pat.
[5:41:46] <%luftraumm1> you tried it with another, not much
[5:41:46] <Happydisaster> Aren’t these guys easier to fit with quicker weapons?
[5:41:47] <kinkade_77> wow
[5:41:50] <RyuuAoi> Woof
[5:41:59] <%Felhad> jesus, a triple boss?
[5:42:01] <pi_in_the_sci> do the rock spells deal blunt  damage?
[5:42:06] <+badhaye> oh fuck this boss
[5:42:08] <RyuuAoi> These guys might be for later.....
[5:42:08] <mantyz> @mantyz thanksss
[5:42:12] <kinkade_77> how are you supposed to kill these
[5:42:15] <Sunstalker> @Sunstalker I don't think the magic caster spread the rot though?
[5:42:16] <lethallylactic> I honestly just equipped a totally unupgraded mace for this fight and was doing decent damage.
[5:42:18] <Xiangchang> Blunt weapons like hammers work on them, but they aren't used much.
[5:42:23] <+zaddyforever> @happydisaster yes, but he’d need to do enough poise damage for it to matter
[5:42:28] <%PrimalDweeb> I mean, their designs are pretty cool though...
[5:42:43] <+Pale_Soul> you have to break their stamina, and then they take regular damage
[5:42:44] <RyuuAoi> Irk, Pat
[5:42:45] <RubberFistFight> this is like ruin sentinels but worse
[5:42:46] <%mornerboi> >you need to use strike daamge visions of lightning
[5:42:47] <RyuuAoi> Idk
[5:42:48] <RubberFistFight> so, so much worse
[5:42:48] <GenericTwitchAcc1> Oleg's aint doing so hot
[5:42:48] <+Pale_Soul> it essentially cracks them
[5:42:51] <+Shimano232> i don't think backstabs count towards the knockdown.
[5:42:54] <%PrimalDweeb> Fuck that rot
[5:43:00] <+anoldtoilet> lol thats a crazy fight
[5:43:02] <it_came_from_outer_space> Game hard
[5:43:04] <Gray_LoFi> Seems like you want a blunt weapon so you can fish for backstabs instead of breaking posture
[5:43:05] <$SGrim> Posion's a bitch
[5:43:07] <%colezone_> I also think two heavies work
[5:43:09] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> once oleg died it was over
[5:43:09] <AlexJacobVO> Wow... just fuckin wow
[5:43:11] <$SGrim> poison*
[5:43:11] <%SlimmieP> Gotta use blunt right?
[5:43:12] <Gelphaze> Good lord!
[5:43:12] <digaogrunge> Two hand your shit
[5:43:14] <+CapnBeefs> Backstabs super count
[5:43:19] <%TaurusOxford> that's the epitome of a "summon" fight if i've ever seen one.
[5:43:23] <+pectusumbra> It really does look like you need some blunt damage just to speed them along so you can switch to curve and kill them
[5:43:24] <Sunstalker> Guess gotta go for charged heavies?
[5:43:26] <%PrimalDweeb> Blunt up
[5:43:27] <%luftraumm1> jump attacks then
[5:43:28] <Midnight188> oleg's life is a harsh one but he knew what he was signing up for
[5:43:35] <AlexJacobVO> FromSoft keeping the title of bullshit bosses a-go-go
[5:43:39] <jubejube56> even if backstabs count the animation takes so long
[5:43:43] <jubejube56> oleg will get shredded
[5:43:44] <Happydisaster> Ah shit she just shattered
[5:43:46] <Foopoof> This boss is ds2 levels of bull fuckery LUL
[5:43:47] <sirrice77> man oleg is already a ghost and he's going through this shit
[5:43:47] <%MaybeFalco> maybe something that increases poise so you don't get hitstunned when they attack you
[5:43:51] <KasiCrafter> They're set up to all cover each other. I don't think it's a weapon coice issue
[5:43:53] <jbrachob> you could with a blunt weapon
[5:43:56] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> you may need a better summons
[5:43:56] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Jump R2 to shit
[5:44:02] <Sunstalker> If you two hand your shield, isn't that strike dmg? @PatStaresAt
[5:44:09] <+hoenhime344> coward
[5:44:13] <+tizziks> YOu have any blunt weapon you could try using?
[5:44:15] <peachy996> poked
[5:44:18] <RyuuAoi> One more college try
[5:44:19] <%luftraumm1> you can
[5:44:24] <%PrimalDweeb> Can we at least see what a blunt weapon does damage wise?
[5:44:30] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @hoenhime344 Nah this seems hard
[5:44:30] <+TheBitingIrish> Jump attacks do a lot of stagger
[5:44:33] <Sunstalker> Might not have to be, could be enough.
[5:44:35] <KasiCrafter> I dunno. I think you can totally do it, but you can't let yourself get tilted
[5:44:36] <%Axellogic> Dont you have a good greatsheild to deflect spearman with barricade?
[5:44:36] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Just to crack them?
[5:44:39] <%Bluwizard21> Crystaline fights only get "easier" with more health. The had absurd resistance till their shell breaks
[5:44:46] <tanarath> Seems like a hidden area, given how these work, I'd mark it on your map & come back.
[5:44:48] <jbrachob> strike just cracks them
[5:44:49] <+hoenhime344> @TurtlesAndTentacles no but do it though
[5:45:05] <+twdlrr> Fuck it send it
[5:45:11] <Sunstalker> As far building stun goes, it's seems to just be dependent on weapon type and attack itself, not tied to dmg
[5:45:15] <$SGrim> I like the base enemy: Magic Crystal Snail Weapon
[5:45:16] <+Pale_Soul> they are going to die instantly
[5:45:38] <IminyourBase> git hamber
[5:45:40] <Ner234> Try jump attacks
[5:45:40] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Maybe use the Demihuman Ashes?
[5:45:41] <+hoenhime344> but do it th\ough
[5:45:42] <+anoldtoilet> you literally did just do more damage iwth the shield than you did with the sweord
[5:45:47] <Sigma_190_Beta> Since you upgraded those guys?
[5:45:48] <%tetraes> u wanna kill spellcaster 1st
[5:45:53] <%MaybeFalco> powerstance jumping attack?
[5:45:58] <KasiCrafter> Wait. So you summoed your distraction team and then...charged in to aggro all 3 of the bosses?
[5:46:01] <Sunstalker> Any club using ashes?
[5:46:05] <%PrimalDweeb> After seeing these guys, I've decided to just take my time with this game...
[5:46:08] <jbrachob> you hit them once...
[5:46:10] <%RealThiele> i mean with those guys you just smash em till they crack then dam,age is norma
[5:46:13] <%Felhad> @patstaresat try 2-handed shield?
[5:46:17] <+emoprawn> I know i did this with an un-upgraded brick hammer and busted their shit open, so maybe shields don't really work as nice
[5:46:29] <zecht89> try the 5 greatshield spirit  one
[5:46:30] <%MaybeFalco> @Felhad he just did that
[5:46:35] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Powerstance jump attacks sounds good
[5:46:43] <%Felhad> oh derp, looked away for a min
[5:46:48] <+hoenhime344> @Felhad THIS...  ive seen a vid where the shield 3hit staggers ALOT of bosses
[5:46:57] <%Bluwizard21> @emoprawn Cause shields don't really have alot of base damage.
[5:46:59] <+hoenhime344> @Felhad dule weild sheild
[5:47:10] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Get that Big Mace
[5:47:11] <KasiCrafter> Fair
[5:47:16] <%watts121> Need blunt, non magical
[5:47:22] <plaguedoctor_vi> you need to break their posture, so focus on heavy attacks and jump attacks
[5:47:24] <+emoprawn> @Bluwizard21 yea makes sense
[5:47:24] <%Felhad> lol, I loved the powerstance shields in DS2
[5:47:24] <%tetraes> let the summons draw agro then bumrush the caster
[5:47:27] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> yeah why not big mace for a second
[5:47:42] <%strakillias> Unequip weapons and use your fists. It's sure to work
[5:47:43] <%Broand> I beat margit with the flowing sword
[5:47:48] <%Axellogic> Do big mace and greatsheild with barricade and youll turn the spear guy into a joke
[5:47:52] <%PrimalDweeb> While you blunt up, I'll blunt up too.
[5:47:52] <AlexJacobVO> That's a GREAT mace
[5:48:11] <Sunstalker> there's a literal Pickaxe in the great club category. LUL Seems fitting for these enemies
[5:48:11] <+TheBitingIrish> CHARGE ATTACKS, PORB
[5:48:14] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> sounds like the mace can't do worse
[5:48:38] <+hoenhime344> attack on titan is the best story on screen right now
[5:48:41] <+zaddyforever> i found a mace that gives “trace amount of runes” on hit or some shit
[5:48:44] <kulmoth> i hate that enemy
[5:48:46] <%Felhad> These dudes need to chill
[5:48:48] <AlexJacobVO> @PrimalDweeb fucking jealous mate. I needs me a plug again so I too can blunt up
[5:48:51] <NewWillinium> The warpick is actually what I've been rocking.  . . . Posture damage is great but regular damage sucks ass at low levels
[5:49:02] <kamehamehAdrian> psaGiefrail
[5:49:09] <Frostydough1> wow they just straight up put that one boss from the evil within huh?
[5:49:11] <%RealThiele> i just also found a boss that became a regular enemy that i was definitely not expecting
[5:49:13] <+anoldtoilet> @hoenhime344 no its one piece
[5:49:15] <+anoldtoilet> :D
[5:49:24] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> stimulating bolus? ... like a suppository?
[5:49:24] <Sunstalker> @NewWillinium I wanted to use it so bad when I found it but they didn't give it Pierce dmg this time so it's not as good as older games
[5:49:27] <IminyourBase> shortcut, but not
[5:49:38] <%californaya> yo, can you just goomba stomp fools?
[5:49:41] <%NotVeryLegendary> isn't that the mid lvl upgrade mat he needed for oleg?
[5:49:49] <+zaddyforever> @realthiele i watched a grafted scion kill itself with its own jump once
[5:49:52] <+hoenhime344> @hoenhime344 comendable argument. if you started 1piece back in 1999
[5:49:52] <+TheBitingIrish> Caestus?
[5:49:53] <%PrimalDweeb> @AlexJacobVO LUL
[5:49:55] <+pectusumbra> it'll be weak damage early but the idea is to crack them faster to thin them out quicker
[5:49:58] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Do you remember the Blunt weapon bullshit of DS2?
[5:50:02] <NewWillinium> @NewWillinium It looks *so COOL* though. I've mainly just been using it out of stubborness at this point.
[5:50:03] <+anoldtoilet> your shield bash literally did 41 damage hitting the boss and 2handing your upgraded greatsword did 30 something
[5:50:04] <Treasure_Vault> Backup stick is a timeless souls tradition
[5:50:07] <%RealThiele> LUL
[5:50:08] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I believe in you Pat
[5:50:11] <+Local16> Did that shit in DS2
[5:50:27] <blue8moon> I've been using morning star as my backup LUL
[5:50:29] <+pectusumbra> INSTANT
[5:50:30] <%PrimalDweeb> Woah!
[5:50:30] <+Technores> blunt weapons work best in most of the caves
[5:50:30] <AlexJacobVO> LOOOOOOL
[5:50:31] <lethallylactic> Ye ye ye
[5:50:31] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> already better
[5:50:32] <RyuuAoi> Better
[5:50:33] <@Fuggins4U> welll sheeeeit
[5:50:36] <%MaybeFalco> wow that does way better
[5:50:36] <nip_nips> its the gank squad
[5:50:37] <rottingpastry> break their bones quickly
[5:50:37] <%Bluwizard21> yeah
[5:50:39] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> time to upgrade LUL
[5:50:39] <%PrimalDweeb> What a difference!
[5:50:43] <+pectusumbra> Now backstab with THAT
[5:50:43] <+TheAngryArtist> no it isnt
[5:50:44] <RyuuAoi> Wow. Imagine upgraded.
[5:50:48] <Treasure_Vault> Hey look it's actually a boss fight
[5:50:48] <it_came_from_outer_space> they are simply weak to blunt
[5:50:48] <$OfficerMods> ha ha imagine if they made a whole boss fight designed around one weapon
[5:50:52] <jubejube56> do you have a blunt summon?
[5:50:53] <AlexJacobVO> WHAT A DIFFERENCE
[5:50:54] <GrandmasterBFunk> lol every streamer i have seen do this boss always is like "fuck it i'm summoning"
[5:51:00] <jbrachob> BONK
[5:51:07] <%Deft_Thought> That mace reminds me that I miss Garl Vinland's armor/weapon
[5:51:07] <+hoenhime344> this fight w/o summons... is it possible?
[5:51:08] <rottingpastry> So I should plan to have a mace in my pocket neat
[5:51:14] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> We all told you with the first Crystal person "Use a Blunt Weapon" lol
[5:51:18] <RyuuAoi> 50% more
[5:51:29] <%YakumoYomi> Bye Oleg
[5:51:30] <AlexJacobVO> COOK THESE FOOLS
[5:51:31] <%RealThiele> crit- > heal talisman would be baller for this fight
[5:51:32] <armadaofghosts> ...of COURSE it works well against them. It's a mace, and they're made of CRYSTAL.
[5:51:33] <kulmoth> @rottingpastry just have all types of different stuff with you
[5:51:33] <%MaybeFalco> YEYEYE DO IT PAT
[5:51:35] <%Bluwizard21> @RyuuAoi I brought that duelist hammer +10 against the spear staff duo and killed the spear guy in 2 combos
[5:51:36] <RyuuAoi> He got it
[5:51:42] <+zaddyforever> imagine some monster no-hitting this
[5:52:00] <RyuuAoi> @bluwizard21 FUK
[5:52:02] <huskarl_zap> I want that mace
[5:52:02] <Sunstalker> THATS MORE THEN YOUR SWORD LUL
[5:52:11] <+anoldtoilet> loool
[5:52:11] <%MaybeFalco> aww
[5:52:15] <%californaya> man, this fight SUCKS
[5:52:15] <IminyourBase> well at least you know now
[5:52:16] <+anoldtoilet> YOU CAN DO IT
[5:52:18] <+anoldtoilet> ITS DOABLE
[5:52:18] <%notsoy> lol got fucked up by the old earthbound yoyo
[5:52:19] <AlexJacobVO> Ok so now there is a strategy
[5:52:20] <+pectusumbra> It can be done
[5:52:20] <+crocodile_t34rz> The theory is sound
[5:52:20] <TheBlankAce> Unironically magic guy last for once
[5:52:22] <Foopoof> Oof
[5:52:23] <%PrimalDweeb> Hey, you did a hell of a lot better.
[5:52:26] <%YakumoYomi> Having to deal with three of them AND Scarlet Rot is some shit
[5:52:27] <digaogrunge> Get blunt summon too?
[5:52:28] <+imkino_> fucking hate those guys
[5:52:28] <%twistedj3ster> maybe crack them all then switch back just so you only menu once?
[5:52:32] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Upgrade that mace
[5:52:33] <RyuuAoi> You figured it out, Pat.
[5:52:33] <ape_hawk> with a SAKULL
[5:52:34] <tanarath> Hey, you're doing it w/ a strike weapon, it's fine
[5:52:35] <%luftraumm1> what if cristarian ashes???
[5:52:37] <%tetraes> Caster>Ring?Spear
[5:52:39] <$realm_forge> Edna mode lookin bitches
[5:52:39] <%RealThiele> instead of oleg maybe the 3 jobber crew would hold better threat
[5:52:41] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt pop some souls upgrade the hammer to like +5 and kill em in 30 seconds
[5:52:48] <%Pookiedaexzile> What if that Mace did Holy
[5:52:49] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> you'll smash their poop in next time
[5:52:57] <RyuuAoi> It'll take time but you did it.
[5:53:11] <@Mechz71> Strike deez nutz
[5:53:20] <%luftraumm1> lucerne?
[5:53:26] <+crocodile_t34rz> Would've been funny though
[5:53:30] <doster504> I hate the dark souls 2 esque bosses in this game
[5:53:31] <+zaddyforever> even +5 would decimate them probably
[5:53:44] <+imkino_> beat the game today using guts greatsword the whole time. probably my favorite of all the souls
[5:53:51] <+imkino_> no spoilers of course
[5:53:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> twin picks
[5:53:54] <Sunstalker> Go lower to great clubs?
[5:53:56] <RyuuAoi> Hammer Bros
[5:54:02] <it_came_from_outer_space> of coursee
[5:54:07] <+anoldtoilet> the big caveman hammer is cool
[5:54:11] <RyuuAoi> Dual Hammers! Let's go!
[5:54:14] <Sunstalker> Oh damn, Pat never found any.
[5:54:17] <IminyourBase> wait, was the whip strike?
[5:54:17] <%luftraumm1> lucerne is cool
[5:54:18] <iteruq> whip strikes?
[5:54:21] <doster504> @imkino_ did you jump attack only for the last few bosses that's the only way I've seen strengthers do it
[5:54:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh they're pierce lol
[5:54:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> makes sense
[5:54:26] <it_came_from_outer_space> brick on stick is pretty sweet
[5:54:38] <%MaybeFalco> whip was also strike too, but thats probably not a good weapon to use for this
[5:54:41] <%Brassnarwhal> brick hammer?
[5:54:42] <it_came_from_outer_space> sends a message
[5:54:43] <%RealThiele> the weird lake dudes dropa  curved greatclub thats pretty cool
[5:54:49] <+Grayhammatter> brick on a stick
[5:54:51] <Sigma_190_Beta> Power Stance Hammers?

[5:58:57] <IminyourBase> here me out, the whip tho
[5:59:02] <Gray_LoFi> The fleshy eye thing whatever?
[5:59:05] <KasiCrafter> Does using your Great Rune get you the dex you need?
[5:59:06] <%RealThiele> does the flail drop from the rider or somewheres else?

[6:01:56] <Sunstalker> Big dragon shares health with dragons around her but is also weak to bleed anywhere on her body which is insane dmg cus it scales to her insane hp

[6:02:34] <fierysnowflakes> Wait, are dragons = birds?
[6:02:35] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[6:02:36] <%justcallmebobplease> ARE YOU FEELING COMFORTABLE?
[6:02:39] <peachy996> You wanna repeat that
[6:02:40] <rosabellamelantha> @PatStaresAt bleeding does percentage based damage and the big one can't move if you wanna cheese
[6:02:44] <AgnusLaplace> every single time he talks
[6:02:44] <%justcallmebobplease> HOW WOULD YOU RATE YOUR COMFORT LEVEL?
[6:02:45] <%MaybeFalco> its literally free
[6:02:45] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Why is there a massive Blue-eyes White dragon
[6:02:48] <+Resderp> Use a bleed weapon if you're gonna smack the big one
[6:02:56] <%Valdorick> Oh, did Pat win?
[6:02:57] <Zourath> Wait, it has a flight attack? I've never seen these ones fly.
[6:03:00] <+Shimano232> true, but the big one has about 85000 hp I think
[6:03:01] <%Broand> Could this be a bird? sayeth pat speaking of ye dragonne
[6:03:03] <%RealThiele> yea use bleed for big boi
[6:03:10] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> It has 70000 hp but bleed lol
[6:03:14] <+pectusumbra> alright, gotta finish up and call it a night. good night all!
[6:03:18] <Sunstalker> Big one also dies if you kill the dragons around her and she isn't very active even if you fight around her
[6:03:22] <%RealThiele> bleed for 13k feels good man
[6:03:25] <%Valdorick> Boo, using Bleed on Greyroll is cheating
[6:03:27] <+Resderp> You can smack the belly too
[6:03:29] <%PrimalDweeb> That's a big fucking dragon...
[6:03:29] <+Resderp> Just stay away from the head
[6:03:33] <%Bluwizard21> away from the head
[6:03:44] <%RealThiele> oh no head
[6:03:45] <Ner234> The size of this lad
[6:03:45] <%twohitgood> attack the big one by its tail
[6:03:50] <%Bluwizard21> frontside bad backside good
[6:03:52] <Sunstalker> Is this a dog?
[6:03:56] <Zourath> The "intended" way to kill it is killing the smaller dragons, each time one dies she takes a huge chunk of damage.
[6:03:57] <rudiciuscaesar> Woah, Pat's still going, rad
[6:03:59] <+TheBitingIrish> You can just attack the tail with bleed
[6:04:01] <%zarkazeon> go towards the fort beh8nd him
[6:04:01] <%Valdorick> I just killed all the Dragons. Each one gives 3K souls.
[6:04:05] <%MaybeFalco> it has an obscene amount of hp
[6:04:09] <+Shimano232> about 85k hp pat
[6:04:11] <%SlimmieP> B l e e d
[6:04:11] <%twohitgood> do bleed damage
[6:04:13] <ape_hawk> look at those ticks lol
[6:04:15] <SarcFa> bleed can make it go faster
[6:04:16] <rosabellamelantha> bleed
[6:04:16] <%Brassnarwhal> i was here and thought the big one was a part of the environment i didnt know it was a real dragon
[6:04:18] <+crocodile_t34rz> Yep, just smack it for 15 minutes and get all the souls you'll need
[6:04:21] <jubejube56> oh is rot percentage based?
[6:04:23] <+Grayhammatter> jesus christ
[6:04:24] <+imkino_> bleed helps
[6:04:25] <%Bluwizard21> Look at that damage
[6:04:27] <%zarkazeon> grace behind you
[6:04:27] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> This isnt pokemon. Dragon isntweak to dragon
[6:04:29] <%PrimalDweeb> Marvelous, simply marvelous.
[6:04:31] <%Meaige> Catch a dragon by the tail...
[6:04:35] <%Bluwizard21> NUNBER GO UP
[6:04:35] <%twohitgood> bleed takes off %-age chunks.
[6:04:37] <+crocodile_t34rz> ...or less, holy crap you do a lot of damage
[6:04:42] <bassoontyphoon> thats alotta damage
[6:04:42] <%RealThiele> rot doin good dmg
[6:04:44] <Manwad> whats that lookin, 100k hp?
[6:04:44] <+Edrem> BIG NUMBER
[6:04:46] <%Brassnarwhal> NUMBER GO UP
[6:04:48] <%RealThiele> also worth like 6 hearts
[6:04:55] <Sunstalker> put on an unupgraded bleed dagger, will be faster even?
[6:04:56] <+imkino_> god damn look at that number
[6:05:03] <%PrimalDweeb> I love it! LUL
[6:05:05] <%Valdorick> 5
[6:05:05] <%luftraumm1> NUMBER
[6:05:06] <%Felhad> 5 I think
[6:05:07] <azure_dunes> it would be fucked up if there's a questline for this dragon
[6:05:10] <+Shimano232> him plus his 5 dragon friends
[6:05:11] <%MaybeFalco> cause of all the other smaller dragons
[6:05:11] <rottingpastry> more dragon more hearts
[6:05:13] <casualbaloth> gotta pump all that blood somehow
[6:05:13] <rottingpastry> perfect sense
[6:05:14] <%TaurusOxford> 100,000 HP???
[6:05:14] <Zourath> Super cheese strat, it's great
[6:05:17] <%Ynkubus_> I will in a moment
[6:05:20] <+TheBitingIrish> Need a lot of hearts to pump blood that far
[6:05:20] <TheBlankAce> He's big he's got a lot of hearts perfect sense

[6:05:27] <+crocodile_t34rz> BLEED IS KING!
[6:05:28] <Sunstalker> 5 hearts cuz so big, I think its pregnancy?
[6:05:29] <%Valdorick> The baby dragons near it are tied to it. So I guess you're getting their hearts too
[6:05:31] <Zourath> Big dragon, many hearts
[6:05:31] <%Bluwizard21> It's Magic Pat we aint gotta explain shit
[6:05:32] <jubejube56> Poor guy
[6:05:32] <%Felhad> RUUUUUUNES
[6:05:32] <peachy996> what do you have against 6 hearts?
[6:05:33] <+jennyfurific> gotta have more hearts to pump more blood

[6:06:35] <Sunstalker> it reduces attack and defense on enemies
[6:06:35] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt You got like 3K.

[6:06:38] <+imkino_> you have 75k from killing the boss now
[6:06:40] <%zarkazeon> nooooooooo
[6:06:41] <%Valdorick> Greyrolls Roar is pretty good. Mass AoE and increases the damage enemies take plus reduces their damage
[6:06:44] <%Broand> yo runes
[6:06:45] <rosabellamelantha> if enemies stand still
[6:06:45] <%Ynkubus_> cash in what you have now

[6:06:52] <%greasypete00> consider leveling up
[6:06:56] <rudiciuscaesar> @Bluwizard21 so it's kinda like the Brain of Mensis after you drop it, gotcha. Thanks everyone who filled me in, sorry to interrupt.
[6:06:56] <%Broand> No they're talking about the runes you have right no
[6:06:56] <digaogrunge> PAT
[6:06:59] <%RealThiele> LUL
[6:07:00] <+FPSDempsey> pat you can get a map piece by going to the stones on the map
[6:07:00] <%MaybeFalco> grab the grace thats right there while you're at it
[6:07:07] <+Shimano232> greyoll's roar is basically wrath of the gods
[6:07:07] <%greasypete00> hes gonna lose them LUL
[6:07:08] <%zarkazeon> there was a grace right behind that dragon
[6:07:10] <huskarl_zap> consider touching grace
[6:07:13] <+Local16> Can't wait for pat to lose em
[6:07:14] <luciluxlu0> is pat now strong enough to get the red lightning?
[6:07:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> he's a pro gamer ya see
[6:07:14] <%cade_calrayn> Pat, have you taken a look at the giant white blob things?
[6:07:17] <AgnusLaplace> I don't trust him too much with that statement
[6:07:18] <GenericTwitchAcc1> just dont die 4Head
[6:07:24] <%cade_calrayn> they're giant skulls
[6:07:28] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt That fort is tough but has the second lift half in it
[6:07:31] <%zarkazeon> fort
[6:07:35] <Sunstalker> Medallion half is here.
[6:07:38] <+dcentii> just got here what has pat done in caelid
[6:07:41] <huskarl_zap> the dectus medallion is in that fort
[6:07:42] <%geekjacob> "i wanna climb that" first thing he said to paige ever
[6:07:58] <+tizziks> 3 whoa
[6:08:12] <%MaybeFalco> reducing attack power? damn
[6:08:17] <%Valdorick> Rot + Greyrol + Power Within = NUMBERS!?
[6:08:25] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Greyoll's Roar is apparently good. It reduces damage others deal, and increase the damage they take.
[6:08:26] <%MaybeFalco> that actually sounds super useful
[6:08:26] <%RealThiele> unmoving mountain more like it
[6:08:30] <DestroPrime83> Mother of Dragons eh?
[6:08:31] <+tizziks> slot's used two?
[6:08:35] <it_came_from_outer_space> do as you like
[6:08:37] <+dcentii> roar is gud
[6:08:38] <tanarath> @dcentii done a bunch, defeated the rot dragon, killed greyroll, healed Millicent, and more.
[6:08:39] <Sunstalker> Roar seems great for the shitty poop crystal bosses
[6:08:40] <%Broand> ok yeah faith has everything
[6:08:41] <digaogrunge> sure
[6:08:44] <TheBlankAce> Those seem the best ones left
[6:08:56] <azure_dunes> definitely wait until you have the legendary version of dragon ice available tho
[6:08:57] <%justcallmebobplease> Pat the Holy Dragon Knight.
[6:09:04] <+crocodile_t34rz> Is there even a reason NOT to have faith in this game?
[6:09:11] <%Valdorick> I'd still recommend getting Rotten Breath, "Just in Case"
[6:09:22] <%zarkazeon> are your eyes yellow after using these hearts????
[6:09:29] <Sunstalker> Arcing up with Godrick's will get you close to the reqs?
[6:09:33] <%MaybeFalco> but paige climbed da tower
[6:09:34] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Dammit I missed it again
[6:09:36] <%Valdorick> Oh yeah, check your eyes
[6:09:38] <dds333a> It sure is Scarlet Rot
[6:09:41] <rudiciuscaesar> fucking love that classic RPG style map
[6:10:01] <%YakumoYomi> Grafted Dragon?
[6:10:02] <+twdlrr> Dragon fist
[6:10:02] <%Valdorick> Just use Dragon Rend for blunt damage
[6:10:05] <rosabellamelantha> I need to go to bed now have fun climbing that fucking tower pat it's the most jank tower in the entire game! @PatStaresAt
[6:10:08] <%shootbang_exe> is there any other use for dragon hearts or are they just for dragon communion?
[6:10:08] <huskarl_zap> has pat ever checked his eyes after rayq Lucaria
[6:10:09] <it_came_from_outer_space> could buy the mace or use the flail
[6:10:09] <digaogrunge> One handers
[6:10:10] <%luftraumm1> morning star
[6:10:18] <%justcallmebobplease> Time to graft a Dragon Fist, Pat.
[6:10:20] <Sigma_190_Beta> Morningstar is probably a good idea.
[6:10:21] <it_came_from_outer_space> its good
[6:10:23] <it_came_from_outer_space> will do trick
[6:10:27] <NewWillinium> . . Oh. I just found the Game of Thrones sword.
[6:10:30] <%greasypete00> its a pretty good weapon
[6:10:31] <%dcentii> morning star is for peasants
[6:10:31] <NewWillinium> Morning star is pretty great
[6:10:32] <Explodincatz> thats every weapon after the first area
[6:10:32] <+TheBitingIrish> Caestus :)
[6:10:36] <it_came_from_outer_space> ok no then
[6:10:38] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Dragon Graft is also a weapon.
[6:10:41] <Sunstalker> Innate bleed and could give it the blood art
[6:10:43] <%luftraumm1> regular is good, reliable
[6:10:45] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Why not Anchor lol
[6:10:49] <+Grayhammatter> i'm sure it'll do the trick
[6:10:55] <trasherxl> what about first big boss hammer? the grafted guy
[6:10:57] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I have found that you get a supermega buff on base weapons with a war ash of the attribute you main. I ran a halberd with gravitas for 20+ hours before I could find anything that could match its damage
[6:11:00] <it_came_from_outer_space> anchor does pierce
[6:11:01] <%luftraumm1> anchor is pierce
[6:11:05] <dds333a> Dare you? Kappa
[6:11:06] <%justcallmebobplease> IT IS SO COOL
[6:11:14] <%YakumoYomi> Fist your foes with a Dragon Fist
[6:11:14] <razz_zie> Did u use godrick's soul? U could get his cool ass hammer
[6:11:20] <dds333a> LUL
[6:11:20] <+Grayhammatter> do it!
[6:11:22] <+zaddyforever> pickaxe would be appropriate
[6:11:33] <+crocodile_t34rz> It's fate
[6:11:38] <%Valdorick> Paige, come on, its not a poop. Its a Dragon's hairy grundle.
[6:11:39] <%dcentii> punch people with dragon
[6:11:42] <%PrimalDweeb> Hi Paige, hope you're doing well.
[6:11:43] <casualbaloth> hand puppet looking ass
[6:11:45] <digaogrunge> GET TWO
[6:11:45] <senfood> That stupid, dumb dragon fist for babies.
[6:11:46] <%luftraumm1> well...
[6:11:47] <jubejube56> The one person in the world using the dragon :p
[6:11:47] <%RealThiele> bear witness
[6:11:47] <%MaybeFalco> LUL
[6:11:53] <%zarkazeon> are your eyes yellow?
[6:11:55] <+crocodile_t34rz> Did you get the other fate fist weapon here?
[6:12:01] <+crocodile_t34rz> faith*
[6:12:05] <azure_dunes> can you 2 hand da dorgon?
[6:12:08] <Sunstalker> The dragon handjob machine
[6:12:08] <%MaybeFalco> its literally the perfect thing for paige, no accidental npc killing
[6:12:09] <tanarath> Paige senses the possibility of murder
[6:12:11] <%Valdorick> Pat's going full Dragon.
[6:12:20] <rudiciuscaesar> lmao look at this Dragon Buster weapon
[6:12:23] <+zaddyforever> pat, jump off the balcony
[6:12:25] <%Felhad> cant 2-hand fist weapons sadly
[6:12:27] <dds333a> only intentional killing
[6:12:29] <%Valdorick> You literally can not 2 hand the Dragon.
[6:12:30] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Never go Fill Dragon
[6:12:32] <djblue_shift> has he checked his eyes?
[6:12:33] <+tizziks> yeah he got the faith claws

[6:34:40] <tanarath> Is that dragon hand upgraded?
[6:35:08] <SuperInhuman> My whole brain negatively effects my life
[6:35:09] <RubberFistFight> Yes, if Paige gets too ADD then Baba ceases to be.
[6:35:11] <armadaofghosts> YOU LITERALLY MADE EVIDENCE

[6:35:30] <%JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt are you gonna duplicate godrick's souls so you can powerstance dragonfists?
[6:35:30] <RyuuAoi> Peach has a gun. I know it. She's from Texas/Chicago

[6:35:41] <marvel877> Officer, I swear, I was holding it for a friend.
[6:35:45] <@Spydurman> Hidden Agenda?
[6:35:47] <kinkade_77> did pat get coded sword yet?
[6:35:48] <%Broand> Arc scaling?
[6:35:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> arcane I think
[6:35:51] <%Valdorick> Occult is anti-god damage
[6:35:54] <+jennyfurific> arcane scaling
[6:35:55] <%MaybeFalco> occult just does arcane scaling i think?
[6:35:58] <%RealThiele> arcane scaling
[6:36:07] <SuperInhuman> amogus
[6:36:08] <%Broand> wha
[6:36:09] <Talliemon> but it makes it b scaling
[6:36:10] <RubberFistFight> @rudiciuscaesar yeah when it degenerated into "but why baba tho" i kinda lost it.
[6:36:15] <%Ne1son> B scaling though
[6:36:15] <Sigma_190_Beta> Yeah, because your Arcane is bad.
[6:36:17] <Sunstalker> Maybe they're weak to occult dmg?
[6:36:18] <+Edrem> Arcane scaling will increase the blood loss buildup effect, not actual damage
[6:36:19] <%MaybeFalco> 2am stream, dew it paige
[6:36:19] <DancesWitBalrog> Y
[6:36:19] <tanarath> Because your arcane us trash

[6:42:58] <mike2hands> NO maidens pat?
[6:42:58] <RubberFistFight> in total fairness Paige, women do get a little sweaty when they get turned on. So like... he was half-right.
[6:42:59] <+imthewisejanitor> Pat has been with bitches, confirmed.

[6:43:43] <Badgerconda_> did pat think that all bodily fluids were sweat? Does he think his saliva is just sweat? DOES PAT THINK EYEBALLS ARE SWEATY.
[6:43:43] <ape_hawk> SWEATY MAGNOLIAS
[6:43:44] <rudiciuscaesar> GRINDED
[6:43:45] <%luftraumm1> when a woman loves someone a lot...
[6:43:45] <%Dakuu75> this is why no one raids these streams.
[6:43:45] <+ScrapKingKeita> man, oleg is just getting his ass beat

[6:43:48] <+Cecrios> Never have I seen Oleg take such a beating
[6:43:48] <$realm_forge> Paige that’s just eye sweat
[6:43:49] <+imthewisejanitor> Oh yeaaaah
[6:43:50] <Trace_Bovier> you don't need strike for this boss. once you stagger a crystal enemy once they are cracked and weak to all damage
[6:43:51] <peachy996> o no
[6:43:52] <huskarl_zap> I'm tearing up seeing oleg get treated like this
[6:43:55] <%californaya> I really feel like you need to get rid of the magic guy first
[6:43:55] <Dave__> my dick gets soo sweaty
[6:43:57] <%xcompleasedad> @PatStaresAt what did he think male pre-cum was?
[6:43:58] <rudiciuscaesar> boiz and beez
[6:43:59] <+imthewisejanitor> pat, stop thinking about sweaty pussy.
[6:43:59] <+crocodile_t34rz> Yep, boss still bullshit. Even with damage
[6:43:59] <mr_snot_boogie> pats to distracted by sweaty puss
[6:44:01] <%Buzzard42> psaDogchamp
[6:44:02] <Saltmeisterr> pat why are you not going for the mage
[6:44:03] <%Valdorick> Reminder that Pat dreams of a perfectly dry body.
[6:44:04] <%PrimalDweeb> Time to summon some people
[6:44:05] <%dmbender> A sweaty pussy is  a happy pussy
[6:44:07] <Ner234> @Trace_Bovier I just told you that he knows
[6:44:07] <RubberFistFight> i mean it technically kinda is the vaginal walls sweating. The whole area gets engorged with blood which forces blood plasma (which is mostly water) and a few other things through the semipermeable mucous membrane...
[6:44:07] <%Bluwizard21> they are the worst type of enemy I've encountered so far
[6:44:10] <$SGrim> Cowards don't know about Grool!
[6:44:11] <ape_hawk> his eyes were cumming???
[6:44:15] <RyuuAoi> Best conversation for this boss.  Honestly
[6:44:16] <%MaybeFalco> hey pat, i don't know how far you want to go into altus, but there's an erd tree that gives a tear for damage negation
[6:44:17] <huskarl_zap> mouth is filled with sweat
[6:44:17] <+lucky_icarus> Have yu tried killing the mage first? Seems to be kicking your shit in @patstaresat
[6:44:19] <RubberFistFight> so if you turn your head and squint a bit he was more right than wrong.
[6:44:22] <Sunstalker> Trace_Bovier Don't matter, it still gives him more dmg then his normal weapons
[6:44:23] <luciluxlu0> I just said fuck that boss for later.
[6:44:30] <+imthewisejanitor> I just laughed so loud I scared my dog.
[6:44:31] <RubberFistFight> YES
[6:44:33] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Paige if you aren't sweatin for that dick what are you sweatin for?
[6:44:34] <%Dakuu75> I feel like, I've learned more than I ever wanted to about these two.
[6:44:34] <RubberFistFight> LEAKING IS A BETTER WORD
[6:44:34] <%Brassnarwhal> you made more progress with the unupgraded mace
[6:44:35] <ghoulspan> IT'S GOOEY
[6:44:36] <+b_gata_h_jay> His eyes were wet because he was turned on
[6:44:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> seeping
[6:44:39] <ThatGuyThere03> gushin'
[6:44:41] <RyuuAoi> Okay,
[6:44:41] <ThatGuyThere03> bussin'
[6:44:43] <+jacksawjack> Leaky vagina
[6:44:43] <%luftraumm1> cum is just a form of blood
[6:44:44] <NewWillinium> Lubricating
[6:44:45] <it_came_from_outer_space> oozing
[6:44:46] <$SGrim> It may be leaking, but it's good for licking.
[6:44:47] <%PrimalDweeb> But it is more accurate
[6:44:47] <RubberFistFight> since it literally relies upon leaky capillary walls
[6:44:48] <$OfficerMods> the lussy?
[6:44:48] <TomahawkSandwich> juiced
[6:44:48] <%xcompleasedad> Let her LEAK
[6:44:48] <+pugszerosugar> No longer a Christian stream
[6:44:49] <Dave__> gettin moist up here
[6:44:49] <rudiciuscaesar> idk leak isn't that bad
[6:44:49] <Willowight> salivating
[6:44:49] <+crocodile_t34rz> Discharge?
[6:44:50] <ghoulspan> gooey
[6:44:50] <%strakillias> Just say moist, everybody like moist right?
[6:44:51] <%epide> ITS VAGINAMANCY
[6:44:51] <%RealThiele> mucal drip
[6:44:52] <Meekest> Got that weeping pussy
[6:44:53] <captainm4d> weeping
[6:44:53] <Explodincatz> slopping
[6:44:53] <comicalmond> it's got the drip
[6:44:54] <$realm_forge> It’s like throwing a mop bucket against the wall
[6:44:55] <%greasypete00> secreting
[6:44:55] <Noogiez> so is it more like saliva?
[6:44:55] <%cascadepersona> Turn that valve
[6:44:56] <ape_hawk> yeah, when FEEEEMAAAAALES squirt, theyre just super-pissing
[6:44:57] <+FadingEmber> secret would be more accurate
[6:44:57] <@PrefectusCorgi> Leakussy
[6:44:58] <%Valdorick> The Spearman is worse than the Spell caster. Let Broleg tank the caster and take care of that spearmen.
[6:44:58] <rudiciuscaesar> oozing is real bad
[6:44:59] <Trace_Bovier> ok guess it still works. I have been using a two handed partizan the entire game
[6:45:00] <Happydisaster> It’s secretions
[6:45:00] <+imthewisejanitor> Mrs. Paltrow has told us that the word is "goop"
[6:45:00] <Glockroach2774> I don't lick vagina for the sweat
[6:45:00] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Yes . You leave hat pussy leakin when its over. And OOzing is great
[6:45:00] <%luftraumm1> the LUSSY?
[6:45:00] <Zeif00> Gushing Gussy
[6:45:01] <rudiciuscaesar> that sounds like a problem
[6:45:01] <%californaya> welp
[6:45:02] <+tizziks> Gimmie that leaky swuusy girl
[6:45:02] <%robotoken> moist?
[6:45:02] <Saltmeisterr> MOIST
[6:45:02] <+thickshield> you know... earlier someone said they were watching this with their kid. hope your having a good time buddy
[6:45:03] <%Buzzard42> F
[6:45:04] <bassoontyphoon> I mean if you had lacklustre sex Ed I can see why you’d think it’s sweat
[6:45:04] <RubberFistFight> lol i love that "DON'T USE SCIENCE TO SAY HE'S RIGHT"
[6:45:04] <NewWillinium> Lubing
[6:45:04] <rudiciuscaesar> WAIT WHEEPING
[6:45:05] <ghoulspan> secreting
[6:45:06] <General_Terro> leak your pussy on me gurl
[6:45:06] <rudiciuscaesar> WHEEPING IS GOOD
[6:45:06] <%Jhylla81> My ex was 15 years older and I had to explain to her what a MILF is because one of her daughter's friends called her one and she didn't know what that meant. She was not a fan
[6:45:07] <%RealThiele> gushin granny
[6:45:07] <%xcompleasedad> UGH
[6:45:08] <Frozen_phoenix> squishy
[6:45:09] <huskarl_zap> Faucet
[6:45:09] <%Bluwizard21> Let the flood waters spill forth
[6:45:10] <+b_gata_h_jay> This boss fight is just awful
[6:45:10] <captainm4d> flowing
[6:45:10] <+Resderp> Weeping Puss sounds like a nightmare.
[6:45:11] <DracaenaLeaf> Ouzzy

[6:45:14] <it_came_from_outer_space> probably some sorcery shit
[6:45:15] <+mac_6ixx> Moist
[6:45:15] <%Brassnarwhal> it's a mucous membrane it's secreting lubricant
[6:45:17] <Willowight> salivation
[6:45:17] <+thickshield> a spell you dont want
[6:45:21] <Sowlith> it's educational
[6:45:22] <sothatsprettybrutal> "scarlet rot"
[6:45:23] <%luftraumm1> keep at it
[6:45:23] <Talliemon> if you get a greatshield you can just guardbreak them and they turn into paper

[6:45:30] <yarrmachine> As the modern poets, the Yin yang Twins said "she leakin', she soakin' wet"
[6:45:31] <%MaybeFalco> this is as bad as the radahn fight
[6:45:31] <huskarl_zap> fire hose

[6:45:54] <@Ranryu692> if Gene is still here, you just told that story to a major news publication
[6:45:55] <%MaybeFalco> @AGood_Noodle i almost vomited at that
[6:45:57] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> You have to beat it because youre a completionist
[6:45:57] <armadaofghosts> They gotta learn somewhow.
[6:45:59] <%Brassnarwhal> stop watching this with your kids you're terrible lmao
[6:46:00] <Glockroach2774> or sweat and the vagina
[6:46:01] <+thickshield> i think it was crystal torrent. it kind of sucks even for casters so feel free to skip this hellhole
[6:46:01] <ape_hawk> @MaybeFalco nah, the radahn fight is cooler
[6:46:03] <ThatGuyThere03> Paige, quick, take more about sweat

[6:46:18] <RubberFistFight> @Brassnarwhal which is mostly blood plasma and is forced out through capillary walls thanks to localised increases in blood pressure.

[6:57:27] <RyuuAoi> A lid, Pat. Like koolaid
[6:57:30] <%Kemmybelle> The bag will spill if you don’t use the whole bag.
[6:57:31] <it_came_from_outer_space> Then its not a milk pitcher
[6:57:33] <rudiciuscaesar> not an ice tea pitcher
[6:57:33] <STORMWIZARD1> I got to tell ya now this is an "Epic" Boss battle between these two @PatStaresAt LUL  PowerUpL SMOrc PowerUpR Whoooo

[6:58:00] <%cascadepersona> Lolllllll
[6:58:00] <%delilah4you> WHY
[6:58:03] <+crocodile_t34rz> A pitcher specifically to hold the bag, Paige
[6:58:03] <HeroToxiko> IT HOLDS THE MILK BAG
[6:58:04] <deviljhojho_> why are canadians like this
[6:58:04] <%Brassnarwhal> paige say the word lis
[6:58:04] <+twdlrr> Pitchers have lids, they always have lids
[6:58:05] <jubejube56> That’s not a pitcher it’s a jar
[6:58:05] <+thickshield> a gravy boat it sounds like
[6:58:06] <+anoldtoilet> sometimes theres a bag clip
[6:58:06] <%xcompleasedad> This is getting me HEATED
[6:58:08] <@Spydurman> how does the bag WITH A HOLE stay sealed????
[6:58:08] <%Brassnarwhal> lid shit
[6:58:13] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Canadians aren't even human
[6:58:13] <RyuuAoi> Wtf is a milk picture?!
[6:58:15] <HeroToxiko> To keep the rest fresh
[6:58:15] <%delilah4you> Why even bother having a pitcher?
[6:58:16] <NewWillinium> . . That's really rreally dumb
[6:58:18] <deviljhojho_> im going to fucking vomit
[6:58:19] <batscientist> BOTH CORNERS?
[6:58:20] <%SirGO0SE> someone needs to inform nato
[6:58:20] <%DeadRuins> HOW DO YOU RE-SEAL IT THO?
[6:58:21] <%discoinfierno> Why doesn't the bag have a twist cap? That seems the best of both worlds
[6:58:21] <+M0untain_wolf> That not a pitcher Pat
[6:58:22] <Sowlith> why not just sell milk in a bottle??
[6:58:23] <Zeif00> It's true
[6:58:23] <B4k4ryuBanzai> The milk bit has gone bad a while now
[6:58:23] <$realm_forge> Powdered milk is vile
[6:58:23] <$OfficerMods> wait how do you seal it again then pat?
[6:58:23] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Just use cartons you freaks
[6:58:24] <%notsoy> how did you live in canada for 10+ years without knowing this
[6:58:24] <+wraithtaker162> so you use an inferior product, that has a more specialized use, to accommodate your ridiculous bags
[6:58:25] <KingKZ> JUST USE A CARTON
[6:58:25] <+twenty112> whoa whoa whoa...BOTH CORNERS!?!
[6:58:26] <LuminusVows> But it WORKS!
[6:58:27] <%strakillias> How do you reseal the bag tho Pat?
[6:58:27] <aaubreyy> hes right unfortunately
[6:58:29] <+ChiuTheFat> it uses less plastic
[6:58:29] <xeros720> that's why you use the pitcher, it seals the holes
[6:58:30] <+pugszerosugar> You won’t win Paige
[6:58:31] <+charp35> Just put it in a carton!
[6:58:32] <@Spydurman> THEN ITS OPEN
[6:58:35] <+tizziks> I have seen people use like a plastic hair clip to close milk bag
[6:58:36] <%matf8> why not a carton then?
[6:58:36] <@Spydurman> THERE'S 2 HOLES IN THE BAG
[6:58:37] <%AllyBeeBoo> why both corners??
[6:58:37] <$Alderain971> stop saying that Canadians do this, its only you weird easterners
[6:58:38] <$OfficerMods> pat if you snip the bag isn't it in an open container?
[6:58:38] <Happydisaster> You have a pitcher just for milk? The fuck
[6:58:39] <luciluxlu0> everyone should drink straight from cow. stop wasting
[6:58:39] <%spitelite> you could also just have a gallon of milk with a cap
[6:58:40] <%Pyon84> I just looked this up...and can't believe it
[6:58:40] <HeroToxiko> bags are hard rto pour and cartons are gross
[6:58:41] <+twdlrr> The bag the ceases to be sales then!
[6:58:41] <huskarl_zap> but is milk cow nipple sweat?
[6:58:43] <leaplearning> milk bags are just a way to keep US milk jugs out of canada @PatStaresAt
[6:58:43] <armadaofghosts> Why both corners?
[6:58:44] <+ChiuTheFat> it uses LESS PLASTIC
[6:58:45] <deviljhojho_> damn
[6:58:46] <tanarath> Pat, how does the bag become sealed?
[6:58:46] <%Buzzard42> HOMO MILK
[6:58:47] <RyuuAoi> Peach been there for a decade and still doesn't understand the milk ha I feel it though.
[6:58:47] <Vermillion129> what's with cadana and milk bag
[6:58:48] <%cascadepersona> Why not just pour it into the pitcher if it's already going to touch the inside of the pitcher?
[6:58:49] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> LUL
[6:58:49] <+anoldtoilet> it uses more plastic THAN PAPER
[6:58:50] <dashmatt> It's actually VERY SMART
[6:58:50] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[6:58:51] <%Valdorick> American milk has that too
[6:58:52] <rudiciuscaesar> LMAO HOMOMILK
[6:58:52] <armadaofghosts> How do you reseal it?
[6:58:53] <Holofono> LUL that's pretty funny tho
[6:58:53] <deviljhojho_> HOMO milk

[6:58:54] <%greasypete00> homo milk is hiklarious
[6:58:54] <huskarl_zap> gay milk
[6:58:55] <+imthewisejanitor> "Let's add extra steps to pouring milk."
[6:58:55] <RyuuAoi> Homo LUL LUL LUL
[6:58:56] <%blankwaffle> lmao HOMO MILK
[6:58:57] <+anoldtoilet> IT USES MORE PLASTIC
[6:58:57] <%xcompleasedad> @ChiuTheFat That you have to trash. You can recycle a jug
[6:58:57] <Ner234> It works sure but why not have a carton of milk? This seems convoluted.
[6:58:59] <anAngryHamster> Pat, how is the bag more secure than the pitcher?
[6:58:59] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[6:58:59] <+anoldtoilet> THAN ZERO PLASTIC
[6:59:00] <%Teintstein> from freshly milked homos
[6:59:02] <%PrimalDweeb> Gay milk, hot.
[6:59:02] <+polothegreatest> MAN MILK?
[6:59:04] <+Grayhammatter> HOMO milk
[6:59:04] <%tentavision> you have to cut both corners or the milk pouring at would create a vacuum
[6:59:04] <%discoinfierno> Technically it's ultra homo milk
[6:59:09] <AthenaAegis> Homodemon Milk Kappa
[6:59:11] <rudiciuscaesar> why the pay phone?
[6:59:11] <xeros720> your american brain can't handle this SENSE
[6:59:11] <%blankwaffle> Jamaica has cock soup
[6:59:12] <dashmatt> blended milk is homogenous
[6:59:12] <+wraithtaker162> like... a functional payphone?
[6:59:15] <+nicversus> and then there's the type of milk that advertises without context "TASTES LIKE HOMO!"
[6:59:15] <%SirGO0SE> directly from the hottest grass fed bussy
[6:59:15] <%greasypete00> most sane american in canada
[6:59:15] <digaogrunge> We had milk bags in Brazil when I was a kid, but we changed to boxes like 20+ years ago
[6:59:17] <bunnicco> DO AMERICANS NOT HAVE PAYPHONES???
[6:59:17] <+polothegreatest> LUL LUL LUL
[6:59:18] <rudiciuscaesar> oh I get it
[6:59:18] <%Brassnarwhal> homogenized
[6:59:18] <deviljhojho_> thats one hell of a brand name
[6:59:20] <+ChiuTheFat> you can recycle plastic bags too
[6:59:21] <+crocodile_t34rz> As if the US doesnt still have old payphones somewhere
[6:59:21] <%RealThiele> PAY PHONE?!
[6:59:21] <%matf8> homo milk straight from the bussy
[6:59:22] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> man to just follow paige around
[6:59:22] <%Kemmybelle> Btw, bagged milk isn’t in all of Canada. We don’t have it in BC.
[6:59:24] <kingmemelord97> A PAY PHONE ?
[6:59:25] <TheHotStuven> ITS REAL LUL
[6:59:26] <%Kevlar_Caviar> cuz i'm at a paaaayphone
[6:59:28] <arcadianskypirate> Is... other forms of milk in Canada in bags too, like almond milk?
[6:59:28] <RyuuAoi> God I want to visit Canada now.
[6:59:28] <%Ynkubus_> Paige is lost in a strange land
[6:59:31] <Kalakukkoo> this stream is wild
[6:59:31] <tanarath> It is
[6:59:31] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Pat did you pass on the Storm Hawk King ashes to Nephili (that you got from the starting zone) and nephili is down the stairs from the blacksmith?
[6:59:33] <%lockbreaker> there are milks in the USA called homo
[6:59:33] <%notsoy> america has NO infrastructure
[6:59:35] <ammobasket> No payphones any more!
[6:59:36] <huskarl_zap> muh nhs that I can't use
[6:59:39] <kingmemelord97> @bunnicco No this ant the 70s
[6:59:40] <xeros720> i don't think the states even have emergency phones anymore
[6:59:40] <%lockbreaker> homogenous
[6:59:48] <%Brassnarwhal> @bunnicco who the fuck would use a payphone in modern day, they all got ripped out
[6:59:51] <RyuuAoi> We have cell phones in America, Pat. We can get the, for free.
[6:59:52] <deviljhojho_> at least you have the better metric system now
[6:59:52] <%tentavision> pay phones are made irrelevant by cell phones. it does suck if your phone dies though
[6:59:53] <armadaofghosts> America is missing like, a trillion dollars in infrastructure.
[6:59:53] <%californaya> WHY IS THAT RAT SO FUCKING BIG
[6:59:55] <rudiciuscaesar> I don't think I've seen a real pay phone in 2 decades, the last one they had to get rid of, they got rid of it cuz people kept getting shot at it, and there were always bullet cases around it.
[6:59:57] <+M0untain_wolf> payphones died with the invention of cellphones
[6:59:59] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @bunnicco we stopped using them a million years ago because everyone has mobile phones, but you can probably find them in older cities
[7:00:01] <%cascadepersona> Paige and the Forgotten Land, releasing March 25th
[7:00:06] <+imthewisejanitor> I haven't see a payphone in like....well over a decade.

[7:01:12] <rudiciuscaesar> as someone from Appalachia, I do not understand the concept of the south and mid-west well....

[7:26:35] <Ner234> BluWizard confirmed not a coward
[7:26:36] <bassoontyphoon> Dumb question, can you summon multiple times?
[7:26:37] <+Walopoh> LUL
[7:26:37] <rudiciuscaesar> Paige, are there any pets illegal in Canada? PA has a ton of restrictions on pets now.

[7:26:45] <RyuuAoi> @penitentpendant Bills for the month already paid , baby!
[7:26:50] <$realm_forge> Oleg is easily distracted
[7:26:54] <SomeAsianDood> Just blame oleg KEKW
[7:26:55] <KasiCrafter> If you sommon too close to the door, the aggro gets borked
[7:26:57] <%strakillias> They need to patch the fact that enemies keep peaking into boss rooms
[7:26:57] <%whyskeywolfe> That’s right, tank that fireball of uncreation with your fece
[7:26:58] <%blankwaffle> you should get mimic it's nutty
[7:26:59] <+Walopoh> Paige

[7:27:06] <+ChiuTheFat> ...important questions: can you own an owl
[7:27:06] <thesaverofhumens> if this guy isn't an endgame boss I can't imagine how insane they are
[7:27:08] <+anoldtoilet> just like
[7:27:09] <%RealThiele> lava chariot is worse
[7:27:09] <rudiciuscaesar> hedgehogs are ULTRA illegal in my state.
[7:27:09] <%Broand> So this guy is "God Skin" like the codex you found in Stormveil
[7:27:10] <Midnight188> Foreskin Apostle cares nothing for you, he cares only to collect your runes.
[7:27:10] <+ScrapKingKeita> Pet Feed for lizards is illegal-- specifically, Cockroaches
[7:27:10] <+anoldtoilet> wait to summon oleg
[7:27:11] <+twenty112> OLEG PLS
[7:27:14] <+anoldtoilet> do it on the other side of the room
[7:27:20] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Pat, stop summoning Oleg near the door.
[7:27:20] <RyuuAoi> Can you have a pet monkey?
[7:27:21] <%Kevlar_Caviar> HE AGGRO'D ON THE OTHER DUDE
[7:27:22] <B4k4ryuBanzai> omfg Oleg is with the bitch behind the wall
[7:27:24] <+TuskDeluxe> Pat have you seen Radahn yet?
[7:27:25] <Midnight188> Oleg is having issues....
[7:27:26] <%Bluwizard21> Oleg is fighting the enemy outside
[7:27:26] <%whyskeywolfe> No Siberian Tigers. Hard line.
[7:27:27] <%Safor17901> Oh, like the chicken vipers.
[7:27:29] <penitentpendant> Oleg want's that enemy outside
[7:27:31] <%Valdorick> Oleg dying to the bouncer
[7:27:31] <rudiciuscaesar> can't own a hedgehog but we do have a caimen
[7:27:32] <+nicversus> Huvved animals
[7:27:39] <+Walopoh> LUL
[7:27:40] <+thickshield> they do let pat keep you, so they have to be pretty loose right? gmartSmile
[7:27:40] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt maybe kill the dude outside
[7:27:41] <rudiciuscaesar> which is totally legally somehow
[7:27:54] <+Resderp> Music is pog
[7:27:55] <$thomassolorio> foxes stink and they piss everywere
[7:27:56] <bassoontyphoon> Oleg going after that clericussy
[7:27:58] <%Valdorick> Fighting that dude is rough though.
[7:28:02] <%SirGO0SE> ?
[7:28:06] <%PrimalDweeb> There
[7:28:07] <%Bluwizard21> its a unique track so far
[7:28:10] <+Walopoh> Dark Souls 3 OST seemed more memorable
[7:28:11] <%SirGO0SE> all of their soundtracks rule
[7:28:12] <SomeAsianDood> Does she not remember all of bloodborne's music
[7:28:14] <ohno58> its not just AAHAAAHHHHAAA choir
[7:28:17] <+Kyma1020> cuz he's wearing the skin of gods
[7:28:20] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @PatStaresAt this is the best boss theme in the game aside from the final boss IMO
[7:28:21] <jumpyhugs> but Gargoyles!  And O&S!
[7:28:23] <+crocodile_t34rz> Lame it out?
[7:28:29] <%Pyon84> I have time, I can wait.
[7:28:30] <djblue_shift> how many hits for a bleed proc?'
[7:28:32] <jumpyhugs> and Ludwig, and Maria!
[7:28:37] <peachy996> The music in this tends to lift more than it did DS3 did if you know what I mean
[7:28:37] <%MaybeFalco> you can do it pat, i believe in u
[7:28:41] <%lockbreaker> im too scared to try souls games, I suck ass
[7:28:43] <mothdude> A win's a win
[7:28:44] <huskarl_zap> this guy was on the prototype cover
[7:28:46] <fierysnowflakes> SourPls
[7:28:47] <%Brassnarwhal> that tics really fast
[7:28:48] <+anoldtoilet> how did he get poisoned
[7:28:50] <+CatRidder> is very nier the music
[7:28:51] <digaogrunge> LAME IT OUT
[7:28:51] <peachy996> It occasionally gets upbeat
[7:28:53] <ape_hawk> does this music make your pussy sweaty?
[7:28:53] <%SirGO0SE> but i love AHAHAHA D:
[7:28:54] <%Valdorick> Oh yeah, that attack deadangles you
[7:28:55] <rudiciuscaesar> One Reborn's theme easily get stuck in my head
[7:29:00] <penitentpendant> Ah, the backpull counts as a back attack
[7:29:00] <%blankwaffle> it's like hunchback of notre dame music
[7:29:01] <%Broand> Here's a spicy suggestion, do you have any spell reflect shield arts?
[7:29:02] <+Devilturnip> the final fantasification of souls music
[7:29:03] <Sunstalker> djblue_shift Dependson the weapon. But some stuff can't bleed, so less useful
[7:29:03] <%Bluwizard21> I am fuckin terrified of fromsoft with a AAA budget after this game
[7:29:05] <+anoldtoilet> does pat have aids
[7:29:05] <Happydisaster> This music is a lot more upbeat, for a lack of word
[7:29:05] <%dcentii> the elden ring music does feel overall more heroic than other souls music
[7:29:09] <$Mekhet09> You know Laurence actually had for real latin lyrics.
[7:29:11] <rudiciuscaesar> that is horrific
[7:29:17] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> HE SPLITS IN HALF?!

[7:30:44] <$Mekhet09> They called it before they knew.
[7:30:44] <thesaverofhumens> RIP old leg

[7:30:46] <B4k4ryuBanzai> His name is Jared and he still lookin good♪
[7:30:47] <%Bluwizard21> So can pats stall strat beat out a guy that is 35-40 levels above him
[7:30:48] <anAngryHamster> That episode was soft banned
[7:30:58] <+imthewisejanitor> “And I want everyone else to have aids too!!”
[7:30:59] <%Pookiedaexzile> Oh fuck todays wordle
[7:31:02] <%Valdorick> Hey, what new sandwich can we release that will make people forget that we gave Jared a contract with Subway?

[7:31:34] <@Spydurman> below 50%
[7:31:37] <thesaverofhumens> he's just saying no bro to your throws
[7:31:45] <%greasypete00> you have a poison mist miracle you could use if you die dont you?
[7:31:55] <%beavnation> what god is he wearing tho?
[7:31:56] <%lockbreaker> Garry's mod-ass lookin boss
[7:31:58] <$Mekhet09> he's out.
[7:32:01] <+5Two> The episode doesn't air on tv anymore = soft ban
[7:32:02] <sothatsprettybrutal> he looks so lackadaisical when he dodges those
[7:32:04] <%Pyon84> Rots out
[7:32:04] <penitentpendant> Poison/Rot expired
[7:32:05] <%Broand> Oh shit he lamed it out
[7:32:07] <thesaverofhumens> rot doesnt last long enough LUL
[7:32:09] <@Spydurman> his rot is gone
[7:32:11] <+Grayhammatter> uh oh
[7:32:14] <Sunstalker> Pat, there's a physik ingredient that gives you a shield for a single hit of any dmg.
[7:32:17] <+Walopoh> got the wordle in 3 tries
[7:32:18] <@tizz86> just lame it out like cross tekken
[7:32:20] <Manwad> THE DODGE
[7:32:23] <+anoldtoilet> ohhh its a rot spell
[7:32:24] <%Buzzard42> F
[7:32:25] <it_came_from_outer_space> darn
[7:32:27] <%notsoy> lmao the breath did literally nothing?
[7:32:28] <thesaverofhumens> I knew it would happen
[7:32:30] <RyuuAoi> Damn
[7:32:30] <+Nomenanza> one more good rot and it's in the bag
[7:32:31] <@Spydurman> FUCK
[7:32:33] <+CatRidder> use your sword
[7:32:33] <+anoldtoilet> i thought he was just ambient giving him rot
[7:32:34] <+Grayhammatter> doable
[7:32:34] <%Brassnarwhal> rot ran out
[7:32:35] <RyuuAoi> So close
[7:32:36] <$thomassolorio> gred
[7:32:37] <it_came_from_outer_space> that might make it tough
[7:32:39] <+crocodile_t34rz> Yeah, that dued is wearing some poor creature's flesh
[7:32:40] <%KnifeyMcEdge> i got that one LUL
[7:32:41] <%greasypete00> the opal tear? @Sunstalker
[7:32:42] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat that dragon head flame always seems to get you hit or killed
[7:32:43] <ITechedDat> that physik is busted
[7:32:44] <+badhaye> You fight the gravity bull yet?
[7:32:45] <@Spydurman> 25% mark
[7:32:46] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Their sure is, I'm using it now
[7:32:50] <%Broand> Spell reflect shield art? Bleed arrows?
[7:32:50] <huskarl_zap> the foreskin of God beats rot
[7:32:50] <digaogrunge> Save oleg for 2nd fase
[7:32:52] <+bone_reaper69> its not any damage but its good
[7:32:52] <%Brassnarwhal> NOOOOO
[7:32:53] <luciluxlu0> and a perfume recipe that does it as well
[7:32:55] <sirrice77> You may want to get him down to 2nd phase and then summon oleg
[7:32:56] <+twenty112> Could maybe bleed him while Oleg is up? Unless he's immune
[7:32:57] <%MaybeFalco> the shield one is for real busted
[7:32:58] <Zourath> Maybe wait until second phase for Oleg?
[7:33:01] <%MaybeFalco> its literally a free hit
[7:33:08] <armadaofghosts> Geeze, he's not just wearing skin but, is like some kind of skin golem.
[7:33:10] <thesaverofhumens> pat why not just equip only your most sturdy shield
[7:33:11] <%Pyon84> I like this idea
[7:33:17] <%Bluwizard21> @notsoy Bosses gain resistance to repeat status effects i think its double resistance each time
[7:33:20] <@Spydurman> going ballsy
[7:33:20] <%Broand> more blue
[7:33:20] <penitentpendant> This feels a little unfair, like chat teaming up to bankrupt someone
[7:33:23] <%Brassnarwhal> a late oleg could be good
[7:33:26] <+TheBitingIrish> Does upgrading shields increase stability?
[7:33:27] <%SirGO0SE> i cant stop giving my doggy kisses and its affecting my day to day life
[7:33:28] <%Valdorick> Oh no, he's wearing skin, he's also just super fucked.
[7:33:29] <Sunstalker> bone_reaper69 I mean, it's absorbed even rot aoe attacks for me
[7:33:35] <%RealThiele> dagger with the ranged bleed might work
[7:33:44] <rudiciuscaesar> got yeeted
[7:33:46] <jubejube56> Is this the “just do 8 dragon breath” strat?
[7:33:52] <huskarl_zap> @penitentpendant no one has told him the real secret yet tbh
[7:33:53] <%Valdorick> @TheBitingIrish Yes, every 3 upgrades, shield stability goes up
[7:33:53] <RyuuAoi> One hit kill holy
[7:33:57] <%Brassnarwhal> @penitentpendant nobody would bet 200 dollars if it would bankrupt them
[7:33:57] <%MaybeFalco> dodging into and past are the best places for safe spots when he isn't doing the big AoE flame attack
[7:34:00] <sothatsprettybrutal> oleg is ride or die
[7:34:00] <@Spydurman> Oleg best bro
[7:34:05] <%whyskeywolfe> The ole one-two
[7:34:06] <+The_EL_Destino> try dodging
[7:34:07] <+bone_reaper69> @Sunstalker i got stepped on by something big and it broke the shield and killed me
[7:34:15] <%Valdorick> Why not Greyrol Roar
[7:34:17] <penitentpendant> @Brassnarwhal I... wish that was true.
[7:34:18] <%Valdorick> to reduce damage done?
[7:34:22] <+thickshield> for all you mages out there, find the no fp use shard... any of the channeled spells become bonkers, and the comet spell is becomes broken beyond belief
[7:34:24] <@Spydurman> just don't get hit
[7:34:27] <bassoontyphoon> Oleg is top tier husbando
[7:34:28] <%greasypete00> oleg would bring you homemade soup when you were sick
[7:34:31] <+imthewisejanitor> Paige, are you gonna stream after this?
[7:34:33] <penitentpendant> @Brassnarwhal Gambling addiction is a thing for a reason, sadly
[7:34:58] <Sunstalker> bone_reaper69 Huh, did it look like it had multiple attacks land? It's worked for everything for me, aside from obviously floor based status build up
[7:35:15] <%Valdorick> Did Pat not rot him yet?
[7:35:16] <%Brassnarwhal> @penitentpendant you're being way oversensitive right now the dude made a bet we arent beating the boss for pat chill out
[7:35:24] <%Buzzard42> I can't tell if this guy is jacked or Oleg is falling off
[7:35:28] <%MaybeFalco> no way
[7:35:29] <%Pyon84> uhh
[7:35:30] <%Valdorick> WHAT!?
[7:35:32] <ReverendGodshyne> uh oh
[7:35:32] <%gag5y> DARKLURKER NO
[7:35:33] <Sunstalker> ROT PAT
[7:35:35] <+twenty112> Nooooooo
[7:35:35] <StealthlessFox> It hurts to see my boy Oleg getting shredded like last weeks newspaper
[7:35:36] <Sigma_190_Beta> FUCK OFF!
[7:35:37] <@Spydurman> HOLY SHIT
[7:35:37] <digaogrunge> oleg needs heals
[7:35:38] <+crocodile_t34rz> LUL
[7:35:38] <+Grayhammatter> no way
[7:35:39] <SomeAsianDood> He was mourning for oleg
[7:35:40] <@Spydurman> A WINS A WIN
[7:35:41] <%EmanXLR> bruh
[7:35:44] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Buzzard42 this is a pretty beefy boy
[7:35:44] <Sigma_190_Beta> DARKLURKER NO!
[7:35:46] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> PAT BROKE THE BOSS
[7:35:48] <%Bluwizard21> @Spydurman I prefer headless guy he dodges attacks like a boss
[7:35:49] <Ghufufin> he missed oleg
[7:35:50] <penitentpendant> @Brassnarwhal Fair enough
[7:35:52] <sothatsprettybrutal> pourin one out for oleg
[7:35:52] <+Walopoh> he's looking through his inventory LUL
[7:35:53] <%MaybeFalco> that would have been perfect if you rot during that
[7:35:54] <+gruff_gridof> he was building tension
[7:35:54] <+jennyfurific> its an AI bug that happens sometimes i think
[7:35:55] <Sunstalker> HE FORGOT THE ROT
[7:35:55] <+bone_reaper69> @Sunstalker i'll have to test it to figure it out. I had assumed after that it had a hidden hp
[7:36:00] <+thesw1tch> he was staring at olegs dead body going "what bitch"
[7:36:01] <thesaverofhumens> the bosses don't even try to hide that they read your inputs
[7:36:07] <ape_hawk> @PatStaresAt hey update on Artisianbuilds: their business license is suspended due to tax fraud!
[7:36:14] <%Brassnarwhal> rot
[7:36:17] <sephtar012> did he just attack with his... robe?
[7:36:18] <%Brassnarwhal> pat the rot
[7:36:19] <%tyler274> @thesaverofhumens sip and he will throw a fireball at you
[7:36:19] <+CatRidder> roll forward
[7:36:23] <Gray_LoFi> Regen spell maybe?
[7:36:23] <it_came_from_outer_space> maybe infect him at like 60% health while oleg still lives
[7:36:23] <+anoldtoilet> @ape_hawk cool!
[7:36:25] <@Spydurman> Oleg then Rot
[7:36:25] <peachy996> Reminds me a little bit of Mr. HMPH from Chalice Dungeons
[7:36:26] <it_came_from_outer_space> that would probably do it
[7:36:27] <%whyskeywolfe> @ape_hawk goddamn wow
[7:36:30] <thesaverofhumens> @thesaverofhumens LUL
[7:36:31] <penitentpendant> W/o Rot, he got down to about 50%. So prog is made
[7:36:31] <Sunstalker> bone_reaper69 yeah, I've been stomped on by big things and was fine. you get the knockback but not dmg
[7:36:34] <%notsoy> lmfao well there goes any hope of getting my computer
[7:36:35] <%Pookiedaexzile> @ape_hawk Someone Inform Woolsworth
[7:36:40] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Rot while hes attack oleg
[7:36:42] <%Felhad> They all know that you like Castlevania
[7:36:43] <+Resderp> the bell-bearing hunter is the best example of boss reading inputs cause i swear
[7:36:46] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Maybe start off with the Rot since it would increase the damage of your Lightning?
[7:36:46] <huskarl_zap> the godskin like get some maidens on you dick with the yee yee ass glint dragon shit
[7:36:49] <jubejube56> If you are trying that strat one of his phase 2 moves looks like you could jump over it with that dragon attack
[7:36:54] <+imthewisejanitor> Artisan builds update!
[7:36:55] <%Valdorick> @thesaverofhumens Strangely, they do, but in a very silly way... if you don't charge a lightning spear, they'll never try to dodge, but if you DO, dodge every time.
[7:36:58] <%whyskeywolfe> @pookiedaexzile he was on stream yesterday saying he was looking into jt
[7:37:00] <%blankwaffle> bro artesian builds really just imploded in 2 days lmao
[7:37:03] <mothdude> Bosses that are Technically Possible are the worst traps to fall into.
[7:37:04] <blue8moon> I believe in you pat!
[7:37:05] <ape_hawk> the ideal?
[7:37:10] <milkandcreamer> the gofskin are easily some of the coolest designs to come out this game imo
[7:37:20] <it_came_from_outer_space> we get it
[7:37:21] <Sigma_190_Beta> Okay, fair.
[7:37:25] <$Mekhet09> Do it at 70%.
[7:37:26] <@Spydurman> ohhhhh
[7:37:27] <Manwad> yeye
[7:37:27] <%Valdorick> Why not Greyrol Roar to reduce the damage he deals/increase your damage done to him?
[7:37:27] <%Felhad> Wait, what happened to Artesian?
[7:37:28] <thesaverofhumens> rot in his transformation sequence?
[7:37:30] <@PrefectusCorgi> Fair Faqir'
[7:37:32] <%crot454> hes got a cool weapon tho
[7:37:39] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Pat hittin that late game strat like a champ
[7:37:49] <%notsoy> does charging the bolt increase the spell cost?
[7:37:52] <penitentpendant> It's honestly why I like you can easily change how many heal/fp pots you can have at any time
[7:37:54] <+Resderp> @Felhad Their CEO shat on a smaller streamer and refused to give them a PC that they rightfully earned from a giveaway
[7:38:02] <%Valdorick> @notsoy It does not.
[7:38:07] <Sunstalker> Would your ice spear be better since you're attacking a Godly boss with godly lightning?
[7:38:07] <+Walopoh> LUL your character's voic
[7:38:10] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Maybe also add in Bestial Vitality?
[7:38:10] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> But you lame with the spears anyway
[7:38:10] <Gray_LoFi> Definitely need Oleg to draw aggro for the rot breath
[7:38:14] <%dcentii> nooooooo radahn thooooooo
[7:38:18] <%Felhad> Oh dang, thats whack
[7:38:18] <%Pyon84> You can do it!
[7:38:19] <LuminusVows> It looks possible
[7:38:19] <%JonathLP> YEAH, ONE BOSS STREAM!
[7:38:20] <Frranky> I was stuck on this guy for two hours
[7:38:21] <%tetraes> @Felhad  Their CEO became twitter main cahracter
[7:38:21] <%whyskeywolfe> @resderp why on earth did they do that?
[7:38:22] <+nicversus> lmao gotta get that $200
[7:38:27] <sothatsprettybrutal> why is artesian builds called aretesian builds anyway. the builds come from... water sources?
[7:38:29] <digaogrunge> its doable
[7:38:42] <%strakillias> Plus if you win you own a guy in chat. It's the moral victory
[7:38:43] <%greasypete00> 0 boss per stream maximum
[7:38:44] <%Bluwizard21> Its very doable
[7:38:47] <%dcentii> play like the biggest coward, they are powerful
[7:38:50] <+Walopoh> it's almost 1 AM lol
[7:38:58] <%PrimalDweeb> !uptime
[7:38:59] <@Moobot> @PrimalDweeb I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 7h 39m.
[7:39:01] <+Resderp> @whyskeywolfe The CEO has done it to many other smaller streamers as well. I dunno why though but a lot of big channels are removing their partnerships with Artesian in retaliation
[7:39:02] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Pat you have been here for 5 hours already
[7:39:02] <%whyskeywolfe> Pat just wants to own a person.
[7:39:03] <%Bluwizard21> he stacks rot and bleed and could end real quick
[7:39:06] <huskarl_zap> I have this dawning realization that when an enemy gets more kills it changes it's combos and move list more and more
[7:39:07] <%Brassnarwhal> @sothatsprettybrutal artesian as in made by an artisan
[7:39:20] <ytwitchmeng> hounds?
[7:39:22] <+imthewisejanitor> You gotta bump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers.
[7:39:22] <shadowboss89> What level is pat at, I just stumbled across this dude and he's one shooting me, but of course now I gotta beat him
[7:39:28] <+TheBitingIrish> What about BIRD
[7:39:29] <blue8moon> jellyfish?
[7:39:32] <ohno58> No group summons?
[7:39:33] <Glockroach2774> is this game like what heroin is like?
[7:39:34] <Sunstalker> sothatsprettybrutal I think they couldn't get the "artisinal" trademark?
[7:39:37] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> He Chat is there a dragon summon Ghost?
[7:39:44] <+thickshield> skelebros may help.. though that aoe will probably end up killing them dead
[7:39:46] <ohno58> need something tanky
[7:39:47] <thesaverofhumens> jellyfish would be annihilated
[7:39:47] <%SirGO0SE> im shocked pats doing summons at all tbh
[7:39:48] <mothdude> Do you have the rot dog?
[7:39:49] <%Valdorick> Group Summons have reduced health, and this guy has AoEs
[7:39:49] <%Brassnarwhal> skeletons might last longer for agro purposes
[7:39:51] <%KnifeyMcEdge> Jellyfish would die in a second
[7:39:51] <+CatRidder> summon woolie
[7:39:53] <%MaybeFalco> jellyfish is also tankier i believe
[7:39:53] <+Walopoh> worth at least a try at this point
[7:39:54] <Sunstalker> Jelly does inflict poison
[7:39:57] <sothatsprettybrutal> @Brassnarwhal but that's "artisan" not artesian
[7:40:05] <penitentpendant> What level IS the jelly?
[7:40:06] <%tetraes> just manfight him
[7:40:07] <peachy996> It's time for Jellyfish
[7:40:09] <%dcentii> jelly gonna get hit in half in 1 hit
[7:40:10] <%Valdorick> Frost Breath and Greyrol's Roar
[7:40:11] <ohno58> big brain paige
[7:40:11] <%strakillias> Yo Pat, Phase one seems easier. Try using lightning spears until phase 2 and do Oleg when he get into the 2nd phase transition.
[7:40:16] <+ChiuTheFat> is it still busted on PC?
[7:40:21] <+ChiuTheFat> "busted"
[7:40:21] <%Pookiedaexzile> Level that Jelly
[7:40:22] <%Brassnarwhal> @sothatsprettybrutal artisan is the person artesian is the adjective
[7:40:32] <%Broand> Rotten stray is also crimson rot damage by the way
[7:40:35] <fatalDestiny> It's less busted, but still busted.
[7:40:39] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> HEY PUMPIK HEAD
[7:40:41] <huskarl_zap> a sweaty asshole
[7:40:46] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> It matters a lot, low level summons   have no health
[7:40:47] <+badhaye> go with lhutel! the shield is a god send and he teleports around
[7:40:48] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Personally I'd suggest the gothric soldiers as they like to keep their shields up
[7:40:53] <%tyler274> yea, still obnoxious frame drops at points.
[7:40:54] <Manwad> bleed's a burst
[7:40:56] <+twenty112> I second the idea of skeletons. Might get lucky and if doesn't OTG them
[7:40:57] <%tyler274> but its better
[7:40:59] <+Resderp> Bleed isnt so much a dot. It builds up and does burst damage
[7:40:59] <%Valdorick> Jellyfish is Bleed though
[7:41:01] <+Nomenanza> oh ye he bleeds like a motherfucker too
[7:41:02] <jnexgen717> LUL LUL
[7:41:03] <%pinkslimegoblin> lick those folds
[7:41:03] <sothatsprettybrutal> @Brassnarwhal it's not though. that would be artisanal. artesian is like an artesian well
[7:41:04] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[7:41:04] <+lussuria156> wait how did he lvl up the jelly?
[7:41:05] <+FadingEmber> just make bleed pots
[7:41:05] <Therusher> I've only had minor stutters and ~4 crashes on PC in 60h
[7:41:05] <+pabloelenano2> the kukiris do bleed
[7:41:06] <%Brassnarwhal> so the patch today didnt fix it?
[7:41:07] <blue8moon> jelly's fairly tanky, and can poison, though it's probably also underleveled for this fight LUL
[7:41:11] <ohno58> You have a the blood weapon buff?
[7:41:12] <tanarath> Git gud/parry him
[7:41:14] <+CatRidder> touch the foreskin  god
[7:41:17] <sirrice77> well bleed might help get him down faster and the rot is for 2nd phase
[7:41:24] <%MaybeFalco> @PatStaresAt i abused the shit out of bloody slash during the fight, since you get enough time between each attack for exactly one hit, and two if it aggros on your summon
[7:41:26] <%Brassnarwhal> @sothatsprettybrutal you know who made the artesian well?
[7:41:27] <+Resderp> @Brassnarwhal Patch did minor things but nothing to do with performance sadly
[7:41:29] <Treasure_Vault> arid bussy
[7:41:29] <%Valdorick> Oh, huh... I kept reading it was bleed... the internet lied to me...
[7:41:30] <%RealThiele> use dagger for ranged bleed
[7:41:31] <+imthewisejanitor> Attack his insecurity!
[7:41:31] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, jelly fish shoots Bloodborne blood
[7:41:31] <%Broand> You can use a bow with bleed arrows troo
[7:41:36] <rudiciuscaesar> gives poison
[7:41:43] <jubejube56> I mean if you learned to melee the first phase you could summon a summon later then get the easy dragon breath
[7:41:46] <huskarl_zap> What's under the hood of the skingod?
[7:41:56] <%crot454> @Valdorick eat food
[7:42:05] <Midnight188> apparently multihit spells fuck up his poise
[7:42:05] <%MaybeFalco> oh yeah kukri, ranged bleed
[7:42:05] <%Valdorick> I am eating, right now
[7:42:05] <thesaverofhumens> bleed is % based of their health so if you *could* land it it would be really good
[7:42:06] <%SirGO0SE> i wnat to get a 2nd of that bloodhound fang so bad
[7:42:12] <%matf8> pat's looking for optimal ways to lame it out
[7:42:21] <%Valdorick> Brownie, for desert, because I already a- I mean, no, nothing, no yoinky.
[7:42:22] <+Resderp> Bleed is generally broken on anything that well... bleeds
[7:42:23] <%greasypete00> @Brassnarwhal patch helped some people but seems to do nothing for the majority of people
[7:42:27] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Just sayin I did not mean t o derail your stream, I just felt you might manage this boss (which you've shown) and its almost 1 so I figured Its a good finisher for the night
[7:42:29] <thesaverofhumens> the problem is actually landing it
[7:42:30] <Sunstalker> Landing bleed on him is gonna be tough
[7:42:30] <+imthewisejanitor> Coincidentally, bloody slash is how they got rid of his foreskin.
[7:42:33] <+TheBitingIrish> Somehow sneak frost in there too
[7:42:41] <Glockroach2774> Rot, Poison, and bleed... sounds like a woman am I right
[7:42:50] <+Resderp> Frost is rare unless its in pvp
[7:42:56] <+Resderp> I have not seen anyone use it in pve
[7:42:58] <huskarl_zap> nice
[7:43:04] <@Spydurman> @Glockroach2774 just Paige eating dinner right there
[7:43:10] <penitentpendant> Bleed IS good damage
[7:43:11] <%Buzzard42> that's good damage
[7:43:11] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> You didnt summon Jelly bob
[7:43:12] <%Bluwizard21> that bleed damage is nuts
[7:43:15] <%Pyon84> That was good
[7:43:15] <mothdude> BEEG Damage
[7:43:23] <+imthewisejanitor> Nice
[7:43:31] <penitentpendant> Orb is focused
[7:43:31] <peachy996> Pat is Foked
[7:43:36] <+Walopoh> Can you do Oleg to distract him so you can get more time to slash
[7:43:36] <KasiCrafter> Hey, what about that dagger that causes bleed with its projecticle?

[7:44:23] <%whyskeywolfe> It’s a she Paige!
[7:44:25] <%Valdorick> I think Jellyfish are both at once, and have dick fights to determine the female.
[7:44:26] <Sunstalker> Jelly also pretty stationary so it's REAL good agro control
[7:44:30] <+ChiuTheFat> the jelly def takes a hit better than  the player character
[7:44:37] <%Valdorick> Or maybe that's tapeworms...
[7:44:45] <%greasypete00> look at it go

[7:45:28] <thesaverofhumens> his second phase looks like what happens when a ragdoll gets stuck in geometry
[7:45:35] <sothatsprettybrutal> i feel like he should take like a million percent damage when stretched out like that
[7:45:39] <+Walopoh> it all comes full circle, and elden ring if you will @PatStaresAt

[7:50:52] <%pinkslimegoblin> there's so many sweet weapons in this game
[7:50:55] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> So does Moonlight Great sword not exist ? DLC?
[7:50:56] <+Nomenanza> ye it feels faster than usual UGS
[7:50:57] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Shows us the Special?
[7:51:00] <%JustToWatch> you should check out the weapon you get from the dude outside the beast cathedral, it's the holy version of this
[7:51:02] <%DeadRuins> new weapon?
[7:51:02] <%notsoy> time for dex and upgrade
[7:51:02] <MidnightPacif1c> attack and dethrone
[7:51:05] <+LandOfTheWay> @RealThiele black flame is fire damage with some bonus damage to divine beings
[7:51:06] <+chimaera24> @PatStaresAt Did you ever go to get that holy greatsword that someone mentioned to you?
[7:51:08] <%greasypete00> itll get nerfed probably
[7:51:08] <+lagmar99> i could be remembering wrong, but aint it like that one black armored npc from the painted world dlc?
[7:51:09] <+spottedwolf10> Part 60 has a pic of Paige and Chris Chan in a part of the vid
[7:51:09] <Sunstalker> Is it a UGS or GS?
[7:51:11] <%notsoy> MGS does exist, it's apparently an endgame quest
[7:51:12] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt You can buy the somber stones from Iji as well.
[7:51:13] <%Brassnarwhal> @turtlesandtentacles it's in here
[7:51:14] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @TurtlesAndTentacles It exists and its tied to a questline
[7:51:14] <+twenty112> Damn it applies blackflame on hit??
[7:51:15] <%RealThiele> ah ok
[7:51:15] <r0flwaffles> its not a ugs is it
[7:51:16] <+Kyma1020> Moonlight Great sword is in
[7:51:18] <djblue_shift> i think pat's gonna like the final boss's weapon lol
[7:51:21] <+Nomenanza> @Sunstalker UGS
[7:51:22] <%Valdorick> Its too heavy for me, sadly.
[7:51:23] <+Kyma1020> I just got it and it's great
[7:51:24] <vance168> It fits your skillset so good
[7:51:26] <%luftraumm1> up it
[7:51:27] <%dcentii> @TurtlesAndTentacles Moonlight greatsword is behind one of the ending questlines
[7:51:35] <+dougtert> Pat have you messed around with the sword of night and fire yet? it's the most broken weapon i've ever seen in a souls game
[7:51:42] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @wizard_of_diamonds @Brassnarwhal Well now I want to stop watching and play
[7:51:44] <kryptotheskald> Awesome, Moonlight Greatsword is one of my favourites.
[7:51:46] <%linSP> speaking of ugs, i got an ug right now
[7:51:56] <it_came_from_outer_space> oh the ugly armour again
[7:52:06] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Thank you guys for answering me BTW
[7:52:07] <%Bluwizard21> @dcentii but dark moon greatsword is rannis quest
[7:52:09] <it_came_from_outer_space> THE CHEST FACE
[7:52:11] <rudiciuscaesar> woah this armor...
[7:52:14] <+TheBitingIrish> @dougtert Does split damage not suck ass in this game?
[7:52:14] <%KnifeyMcEdge> i like it
[7:52:19] <kingra> Horrible armor
[7:52:19] <+Nomenanza> You do a jojo pose in the armour it's awesome
[7:52:21] <%greasypete00> the head is kinda funky
[7:52:22] <%boggsz12> the metal baby you're breastfeeding
[7:52:23] <%Valdorick> Lotrics Armor's was also rad
[7:52:24] <%luftraumm1> that armour is very ugly
[7:52:25] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Legit most Chats just ignore
[7:52:28] <+ScrapKingKeita> It's the FAP armor
[7:52:32] <Sunstalker> He's wearing an armor made out of dudes making out
[7:52:34] <%dcentii> @Bluwizard21 yeah her quest is one of the ones that gives a different ending
[7:52:38] <+twenty112> All my homies hate Lautrec
[7:52:41] <haisho> reminds me of Vauthry
[7:52:45] <thesaverofhumens> @TheBitingIrish depends on the enemy but you need to remember all damage has to be calculated through multiple different defenses
[7:52:46] <digaogrunge> Reminds me of Quaato from Total Recall
[7:52:48] <+imthinkingdarbys> hate lautrec
[7:52:49] <@Spydurman> man you have like 2-3 levels worth of souls from that fight holy crap
[7:52:52] <armadaofghosts> It's like Lautrec's chest, but the body is try to escape.
[7:52:56] <it_came_from_outer_space> he sells up to 4 i think
[7:52:59] <%Broand> It too, scales with faith
[7:52:59] <+dougtert> @TheBitingIrish the split damage is perfectly fine but the weapon art is the most absurdly powerful thing i've seen
[7:53:01] <%MaybeFalco> ive actually been rocking the broadsword you get from starting with confessor the whole game, and it kicks ass pretty hard
[7:53:02] <%Valdorick> Paige doesn't remember him, because his only defining trait is that he killed a VVomen
[7:53:03] <Happydisaster> It’s good when it’s the full set, but the wolf head sort of ruins it
[7:53:04] <%notsoy> would more dex be better to not need the specific amulet?
[7:53:13] <$SGrim> Lautrec's Armor always screamed of 'No Maidens'
[7:53:14] <huskarl_zap> inb4 a 90k rune loss
[7:53:24] <%Bluwizard21> @dcentii havent come close to the end but i figured when she told me, i thought you were talking about a literal game ending quest
[7:53:24] <%Brassnarwhal> yes
[7:53:44] <Sunstalker> It's the reach-around armor
[7:53:45] <%Brassnarwhal> @sgrim really cause he had a god on his rod
[7:53:46] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt You probably should Respec right?
[7:53:46] <%luftraumm1> it works on d but on player character it looks like you have a hump back
[7:53:51] <%Valdorick> Wait... something is... coming back to me...
[7:54:05] <%Valdorick> Pat, you need Somber Stones, right? Go to the Trap cave.
[7:54:24] <%Valdorick> Then you can buy Somber Stones.
[7:54:42] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Rannis questline will give you somber stones up to +9
[7:54:45] <Sunstalker> Valdorick He beat it, also this smith just sells them
[7:54:45] <%MaybeFalco> now go smack radahn lmao
[7:54:45] <$Mekhet09> Did you get the 3rd bell?
[7:54:46] <sun312772> does anyone remember where to get the sword the giants use ?
[7:54:47] <Sigma_190_Beta> Not the Somber Stone 5 he needs.
[7:54:50] <winterkiz> iji has some dialogue options
[7:55:03] <+Nomenanza> oh come on
[7:55:09] <%Valdorick> Oh, nevermind, I'm blind and kept seeing the sword as being lower than it was
[7:55:16] <%luftraumm1> damn
[7:55:33] <%Pookiedaexzile> YO GIANT WHY YA STOMUSSY OUT
[7:55:50] <%dcentii> Has pat met Blaidd and Ranni yet?
[7:55:54] <%greasypete00> "Seek hidden path"
[7:55:56] <TrashManRising> That's a cool sword
[7:56:01] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Killing the 3 pot warriors gets the +2 arsenal charm
[7:56:19] <%greasypete00> @dcentii  hes wearing blaidd's head
[7:56:22] <huskarl_zap> damn he doesn't know how to get to the other under city either
[7:56:22] <%dcentii> ok yeah
[7:56:25] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> If you need more equip
[7:56:25] <%connorfromearth> how do i get seluvis to give me the introduction letter so i can progress this quest? im stuck
[7:56:32] <+nicversus> I wish this guy was voiced by Taika Waititi doing the Korg voice lol
[7:56:33] <@QueequegTheater> excuse me, the Empyrean monkaS
[7:56:42] <+Nomenanza> look after not-Guts
[7:56:49] <atticustf> he sounds like the guy who narrates the ps1 harry potter game
[7:56:50] <%dcentii> how far is he in that questline?
[7:57:02] <%Brassnarwhal> @connorfromearth agree to give the potion to the girl
[7:57:03] <sirrice77> @connorfromearth goto nokris and talk to blaidd till he says to talk to seluvis, then go talk to him for letter
[7:57:05] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @dcentii still need to kill radahn
[7:57:08] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I think RR Martin wrote their shit
[7:57:27] <~PatStaresAt> Strength 20 / Dex 22 / Vig 25 / End  25 /
[7:57:29] <huskarl_zap> Nokon Deez nutz
[7:57:30] <plaguedoctor_vi> Hey Pat just defeted that same boss and boy it was something
[7:57:31] <%dcentii> radahn is the coolest
[7:57:40] <%Valdorick> Mind needs to be 20 for Broleg
[7:57:43] <it_came_from_outer_space> @PatStaresAt are you going to account for talismans?
[7:57:45] <digaogrunge> MIND 20 FOR OLEG
[7:57:52] <%connorfromearth> I gave the potion to the guy instead, and Blaidd is at the Radahn festival but i havent beaten that boss yet
[7:58:03] <penitentpendant> ARC 15 for the breath?
[7:58:14] <Akai_Akira> God damn just beat the boss as well....not fun as a funny magic man with just 16 Vigor
[7:58:15] <+darkgear_96> I stoped playing right now when I saw those fucking spider hands
[7:58:29] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> STR 20 DEX 22 VIG 25 INT 25 FAITH 23 ARC 17
[7:58:44] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> there you go Pat
[7:58:49] <%MaybeFalco> @darkgear_96 run past em, you'll barely ever see them again
[7:58:58] <%JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt did you beat the guy outside the beast cathedral? you might really like that weapon
[7:59:12] <heartlesshealer> thank you wise beasts
[7:59:18] <huskarl_zap> the queen cuck of the cuck kingdom and cuck school
[7:59:19] <@PrefectusCorgi> STR20 DEX22 VIG25 END25 FTH23 ACN17
[7:59:32] <Sigma_190_Beta> Vigor.
[7:59:35] <+dougtert> five points out of endurance
[7:59:37] <penitentpendant> Vig is the 'dump stat'
[7:59:40] <tanarath> mind 20
[7:59:45] <digaogrunge> VIGOR GOES DOWN AGAIN
[7:59:47] <it_came_from_outer_space> maybe spread vig and endurance
[7:59:49] <%JustToWatch> you have a faith talisman
[7:59:54] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Would Radagons soreseal cover the 5 deficit?
[8:00:00] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> is Vig really a dump stat? damn
[8:00:02] <deviljhojho_> you're getting laid out in two hits anyways, whats the difference?
[8:00:03] <Happydisaster> Vigor
[8:00:10] <Happydisaster> Aww
[8:00:22] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Endurance isnt as good in this game
[8:00:24] <it_came_from_outer_space> why not just 22 en 23 vig
[8:00:37] <kinkade_77> No you need the vit you get one shot too often
[8:00:40] <deviljhojho_> that seems reasonable enough
[8:00:41] <%MaybeFalco> if you're gonna go low vig, you should have the shield tear on your flask then
[8:00:42] <penitentpendant> @TurtlesAndTentacles It's weird. Because it's the stat that doesn't 'prevent equips' it's the 'lowest priority' but they absolutely expect it to be high by endgame
[8:00:42] <Sigma_190_Beta> I think that's fine.
[8:00:45] <it_came_from_outer_space> yea seems most like your current statline
[8:00:49] <%Nobrev> looks good to me
[8:00:50] <%strakillias> Nah 22/22 and 18 arcane so its even
[8:00:50] <digaogrunge> GOOD
[8:01:18] <deviljhojho_> this better be good
[8:01:19] <%notsoy> fat rolling tho
[8:01:25] <+M0untain_wolf> You did
[8:01:30] <haisho> big heavy Pat
[8:01:33] <%xcompleasedad> Pat, some bossess can COUNTER spells
[8:01:50] <%topendbuzza> time for skin Kappa
[8:01:51] <%MaybeFalco> yeah definitely don't want fat rolls fighting radahn
[8:02:11] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt follow rannis quest to the end and you will have a +9 on that swird
[8:02:17] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Bleed is gone but for coolness
[8:02:20] <+ekodrop> fat roll still better than a pat roll
[8:02:25] <+darkgear_96> @maybefalco thanks dude i’ll try tomorrow when the sun comes out again :p
[8:02:28] <deviljhojho_> i saw some guy solo radahn on foot yesterday
[8:02:34] <deviljhojho_> he was a freak
[8:02:50] <+Double_Tap_That> @ekodrop What's the difference?
[8:03:02] <it_came_from_outer_space> nicely done
[8:03:15] <+ChiuTheFat> you look like a boss character now
[8:03:21] <deviljhojho_> oh thats chunky
[8:03:34] <thesaverofhumens> melted
[8:03:39] <+Nomenanza> Isnt there a follow up on additional L2? I forget
[8:03:45] <+pabloelenano2> how far did you upgrade that sword?
[8:03:49] <+Resderp> That weapon art probably wont go off in most boss fights that are mobile
[8:03:56] <luciluxlu0> I wonder how it works on dragons
[8:03:59] <+Grayhammatter> jesus christ
[8:04:00] <penitentpendant> @ChiuTheFat Praise the aesthetic of carrying a really large weapon
[8:04:05] <+pabloelenano2> nice
[8:04:16] <plaguedoctor_vi> you can probally kill those 3 crystal boss now
[8:04:17] <%pinkslimegoblin> I want a dark souls katamari game where you get bigger as you get more souls.
[8:04:25] <%luftraumm1> glad top have been here for all this, have a great rest of your stream
[8:04:28] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt greatswords are great for crowds and horseback
[8:04:32] <plaguedoctor_vi> that weapon does a lot of posture damage
[8:04:33] <+Nomenanza> Really similar to the immortal blade art from Sekiro
[8:04:33] <deviljhojho_> this could be real good on the not-as-relentless bosses
[8:04:35] <thesaverofhumens> since it's such a heavy weapon it staggers everything too
[8:04:48] <%KnifeyMcEdge> i need this thing now
[8:04:49] <+Nomenanza> Oh your horseback R2s are hilarious actually
[8:05:00] <%Bluwizard21> but check the damage on those swings
[8:05:22] <penitentpendant> Looks good so far
[8:05:26] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Also there's a door up here on the tower you missed apparently.
[8:05:35] <+Nomenanza> Collosal weapons can combo normal sized enemies as long as you got stamina with their horseback R2s
[8:05:36] <$Mekhet09> Did you get the third miner bell @PatStaresAt
[8:05:49] <deviljhojho_> yeah that aint bad
[8:06:07] <huskarl_zap> Rahdans sigma army stood up to that shit
[8:06:13] <Gray_LoFi> Oh that weapon art got posture
[8:06:21] <+Resderp> Nice butterknife
[8:06:21] <deviljhojho_> how fast is the jump atack on these greatswords?
[8:06:25] <thesaverofhumens> poise
[8:06:28] <B4k4ryuBanzai> you can spam these chumps and giants
[8:06:32] <%Bluwizard21> shit i aint got a 3rd for any bell
[8:06:38] <$Mekhet09> Oh there are more that let you buy stones.
[8:06:41] <Gorgs7> why do really awesome weapons in souls games always look like hot garbage?
[8:06:42] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> The weapon art is like mortal draw from sekiro
[8:07:07] <deviljhojho_> oh fuck
[8:07:09] <PizzicatoFive5> !uptime
[8:07:09] <@Moobot> @PizzicatoFive5 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 8h 7m.
[8:07:21] <huskarl_zap> Dog?
[8:07:23] <Savage_Howitzer> coxOmg
[8:07:25] <+imthinkingdarbys> oh these guys are great, haven't seen them yet
[8:07:28] <%dcentii> Doggosaurus
[8:07:31] <+wizard_of_diamonds> These T-Rex dogs are such abominations
[8:07:33] <+ChiuTheFat> eww...trex doggos
[8:07:37] <penitentpendant> It's weird that Rot makes animals have Bobble Heads
[8:07:45] <+darkgear_96> What is the name of the Sword?
[8:07:48] <deviljhojho_> two hits rule still applies
[8:07:52] <%pinkslimegoblin> these are the only bad dogs
[8:07:52] <deviljhojho_> lmao
[8:07:55] <+Nomenanza> that merchant got nerves of steel
[8:08:01] <Frranky> get staggered, son
[8:08:06] <deviljhojho_> thats some nice stagger
[8:08:16] <%Bluwizard21> That's some damage
[8:08:24] <Savage_Howitzer> coxManleee
[8:08:25] <%strakillias> These dog must be the result of Miyazaki watching The Mask
[8:08:26] <+nicversus> WHOA that thing looks like an immaceated version of Trico from the last guardian lmao
[8:08:29] <Savage_Howitzer> bigtun1Ellie
[8:08:35] <haisho> that's some big stagger power
[8:08:36] <%MaybeFalco> hey pat pro tip, on the west side of the bridge by the warmaster's shack in limgrave, you can find alexander the tea pot and get him unstuck if you haven't already
[8:08:41] <ytwitchmeng> The next Jurassic World movie is looking alright
[8:08:42] <%notsoy> two-handing before you crit/visceral does more damage, right? switching is probably tricky tho
[8:08:43] <%Pookiedaexzile> Patron Returns to Jesus,
[8:08:44] <Balsty> you're wielding a fucking baseball bat and breaking their legs every 3 swings
[8:08:48] <+pabloelenano2> change your flasks
[8:08:51] <Savage_Howitzer> bigtun17 bigtun17 bigtun17
[8:09:05] <RyuuAoi> @ytwitchmeng Hated the ending if the last one though.
[8:09:11] <Kaito_Cam> Yo i found a mimic summon and when you use it it has the exact same skills of you
[8:09:18] <%MaybeFalco> oh you did? i wasn't there for it, but he should have shown up in the cave with that lizard dragon
[8:09:19] <%Pookiedaexzile> Ice Lightning
[8:09:24] <@QueequegTheater> @Kaito_Cam where
[8:09:38] <penitentpendant> Something I've been meaning to ask people who own the game: If you two hand the STR scaling catalyst, does that increase spell damage?
[8:09:44] <%Bluwizard21> You have all that you need for radahn other than actually beating him. Cause that shit took me 5 hours
[8:09:45] <+Edrem> @Kaito_Cam mimic summon is completely broken with blood weapons, 2x apply
[8:09:47] <Sunstalker> MaybeFalco Alexander actually shows up at a mandatory event later even if you never met him so his quest is pretty idiot proofed
[8:09:48] <Kaito_Cam> it's in nokron behind a stonekey wall @QueequegTheater
[8:09:54] <@QueequegTheater> thx
[8:09:54] <it_came_from_outer_space> maybe eyebeam, its an extremely fast long range projjectile
[8:09:55] <huskarl_zap> no ice lightning hmm?
[8:09:57] <blue8moon> there are somber smithing stones 5+ on top of the plateau when you explore around there
[8:10:09] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt The Roar takes up 2.
[8:10:10] <%MaybeFalco> @Sunstalker oh fr? i thought you had to meet him first
[8:10:12] <Savage_Howitzer> doomsn7 doomsn7 doomsn7
[8:10:12] <%pinkslimegoblin> some take 2
[8:10:12] <Gray_LoFi> Grey roar takes 2
[8:10:12] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> wow i went to gym and pat's still playing
[8:10:14] <%greasypete00> 2 slot spells
[8:10:16] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> some spells take more than one slot
[8:10:16] <Sunstalker> One takes up 2 slots?
[8:10:19] <+jennyfurific> one takes 2 spell slots
[8:10:19] <%dcentii> some spells take 2 slots
[8:10:20] <blue8moon> one of those takes 2 slots
[8:10:20] <+LandOfTheWay> roar takes 2
[8:10:20] <$Mekhet09> One takes two.
[8:10:21] <%Valdorick> Greyroar is 2
[8:10:21] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> yup
[8:10:22] <%YakumoYomi> Do any of those require more than one slot?
[8:10:23] <%Nobrev> does one of your spells take 2 slots?
[8:10:30] <Kaito_Cam> @Edrem i stumbled upon the storm ruler mechanic boss and had my mimic have the weapon as well it was awesome
[8:10:39] <Sunstalker> MaybeFalco yeah he introduces himself then
[8:10:40] <@Ranryu692> I think it was the one in the middle that was taking up 2
[8:10:44] <Savage_Howitzer> doomsnKiwi
[8:10:47] <%greasypete00> that seems bad
[8:10:48] <+Stormzcales_Lair> pffft i check on pat and Max's sreams and they have on same gear
[8:10:59] <+Stormzcales_Lair> must b good
[8:11:00] <+pabloelenano2> good for multiplayer, bad for pve
[8:11:01] <%MaybeFalco> doesn't it also debuff them?
[8:11:01] <%dcentii> @PatStaresAt blows up like 20 small enemies, not as good on larger ones
[8:11:02] <Savage_Howitzer> doomsnKiwiShake doomsnKiwiShake doomsnKiwiShake
[8:11:05] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt WEakening the enemy and staggerin them is pretty good
[8:11:08] <%Valdorick> Its for debuffing the enemy, not damaging them
[8:11:10] <%Cynical2DD> The fuck is that!?
[8:11:11] <$Mekhet09> It's for removing mobs.
[8:11:13] <$SGrim> Scrappy Doo from the 2000's movie?
[8:11:14] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt It increases damage dealt to and reduces damage they deal.
[8:11:17] <djblue_shift> lowered their defebse
[8:11:17] <%Puhff> Yeah it sucks  :(
[8:11:18] <Manwad> oh shit
[8:11:32] <Sunstalker> It's good for dungeon bosses
[8:11:42] <penitentpendant> Dinner is served~
[8:11:43] <%KnifeyMcEdge> what is the sword called again?
[8:11:43] <huskarl_zap> pitbull in a kindergarten noises from these dogorex
[8:11:52] <%Valdorick> It also looked like it instantly staggered the dog
[8:11:53] <Kaito_Cam> I've beaten 4 of the demi-gods and I'm level 106
[8:12:14] <+Nomenanza> I hope Radahn goes well
[8:12:15] <%Valdorick> Oh wait Pat! You're at a nighttime boss grace!
[8:12:20] <%dcentii> I can't wait for the bridge to tell pat to turn around
[8:12:27] <+Kavtech> @Kaito_Cam I've beaten... 5 I think and I'm level 120.
[8:12:28] <tolloponik> Is this the first souls equipment that allows you to debuff enemies?
[8:12:29] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> jaydPEPE
[8:12:36] <%MaybeFalco> it took me about 2ish hours to kill radahn
[8:12:53] <%notsoy> lmao
[8:12:53] <+sambws> Radhan is sorta bs
[8:12:55] <penitentpendant> 'Seeing him' is at least feasible
[8:12:56] <%Cynical2DD> Oh my god it is Scrappy
[8:13:00] <%dcentii> Doggosaurus doesn't mess around
[8:13:09] <Sunstalker> tolloponik Nah, been other magics that do it before
[8:13:13] <Kaito_Cam> @Kavtech ok i was thinking I was getting too high level.
[8:13:16] <%Valdorick> Eh, Pat is using Scarlet Rot, he's got Radhan's number.
[8:13:18] <huskarl_zap> dogorex>the black flame of occult
[8:13:23] <%Ynkubus_> 30mins to get my 2 hit off on Radahn
[8:13:48] <Sigma_190_Beta> Did he hit the merchant?
[8:13:49] <%MaybeFalco> i think i had vigor somewhere around 20-25 and i was getting one-shot by a good majority of attacks
[8:13:49] <+Edrem> anyone who says you should never use summons is going to hate radahn LUL
[8:13:52] <Sunstalker> Hey, there's like no "Iron flesh" pyromancy this time, right?
[8:14:06] <+Nomenanza> oh it's this dude
[8:14:13] <+Saggitori> didn't radan kill a fucking galaxy or something
[8:14:14] <%Bluwizard21> That's a beefy boi
[8:14:14] <thesaverofhumens> fuckin sith lords
[8:14:15] <+wizard_of_diamonds> He's got a fucking drill sword!?
[8:14:15] <+imthinkingdarbys> that's cool
[8:14:17] <Vermillion129> ow?
[8:14:19] <FeralFozzie> he's a sith
[8:14:19] <penitentpendant> The force choke
[8:14:19] <it_came_from_outer_space> yea a liittle early
[8:14:22] <jumpyhugs> D:
[8:14:23] <TrashManRising> that guy is pretty cool
[8:14:23] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Maybe with your other swords?
[8:14:26] <+pabloelenano2> look at this fucking  dude
[8:14:28] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> What a cool edgelord
[8:14:29] <heartlesshealer> OHKO
[8:14:30] <tolloponik> that was Awsome I want it!!!
[8:14:31] <+ShadowRFox> can you dragon rot him?
[8:14:32] <%dcentii> yeah them guys got force powers
[8:14:33] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> he's cool
[8:14:39] <Sigma_190_Beta> Ah, fair.
[8:14:42] <Sigma_190_Beta> Sorry about that.
[8:14:47] <%MaybeFalco> @Saggitori "Starscourge" Radahn
[8:14:58] <Sigma_190_Beta> I forgot that this sword is cool.
[8:15:07] <%Bluwizard21> I feel several aspects of this game are proving grounds for the next armored core
[8:15:08] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> there's more than one bell hunter?
[8:15:29] <+Ingenk> “Tokyo drift Radahn”
[8:15:45] <%Bluwizard21> It probably is the same one, I've fought the same fucking anastasia tarnished eater 3 times
[8:16:04] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> its one guy
[8:16:08] <%Bluwizard21> all she's been eating is my darkmoon greatsword
[8:16:15] <+grip_fast> Have you killed the sleeping dragon yet???
[8:16:18] <Vermillion129> I love torrent
[8:16:26] <ape_hawk> its up your butt
[8:16:35] <+imthewisejanitor> You see Anastasia is being pulled from Disney+? (But not for the reason you might think)
[8:16:35] <%Puhff> Wait, does bell hunter mean he hunts merchants? Y do that???
[8:16:38] <%MaybeFalco> i know theres a deathroot in altus
[8:16:45] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt do you want a location to another deathroot (it's kinda a spoiler) but not really
[8:17:02] <penitentpendant> Dragon?
[8:17:04] <+pabloelenano2> lure a dragon
[8:17:08] <Sunstalker> There's one below in the cliff and one around the back of the erd tree
[8:17:11] <mantyz> try dragon
[8:17:31] <+Saggitori> try dragon but hole
[8:17:31] <+grip_fast> the big one gives 80k runes
[8:17:37] <+imthewisejanitor> Seduce dragon.
[8:17:42] <%notsoy> lmao hell no
[8:17:54] <%Valdorick> As a reminder: In Cealid (opposed to Dragonborrow), look for tree branches at the top of a cliff, and climb them.
[8:18:12] <%MaybeFalco> theres another dragon on the bridge to the sanctum
[8:18:24] <Saltmeisterr> omg how long did max play babylon's fall
[8:18:29] <%MaybeFalco> real one
[8:18:29] <Saltmeisterr> i wanna know
[8:18:30] <Sunstalker> REAL
[8:18:34] <luciluxlu0> real
[8:18:34] <%boggsz12> it's real
[8:18:35] <Vermillion129> real one
[8:18:39] <%dcentii> he is super real
[8:18:40] <%Valdorick> Its a real mother fucker
[8:18:45] <%Bluwizard21> a real one or one of the garbage
[8:18:50] <+imthewisejanitor> @Saltmeisterr Longer than I expected tbh.
[8:18:56] <Sunstalker> also a nightrider next to ti
[8:18:57] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt The one on the bridge will eat u
[8:19:04] <%MaybeFalco> there's also a grace directly on the other side too for quick restarts
[8:19:08] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> tiny space big dragon
[8:19:17] <luciluxlu0> there's also an ultra real dragon by those carriages as well
[8:19:28] <Gray_LoFi> Maybe spend the 29k runes before dragon hunting
[8:19:39] <%Valdorick> I think Pat killed the Decaying Dragon.
[8:19:43] <%dcentii> Caelid is wild because theres two points where it tells you that you aren't ready for the zone, at the entrance near limgrave and this bridge
[8:19:46] <%Valdorick> Since he has his breath attck.
[8:19:53] <%MaybeFalco> i love how they hit you for 1 damage
[8:19:58] <+jennyfurific> he did kill ezkyes
[8:20:08] <%MaybeFalco> LMAO
[8:20:10] <%greasypete00> LUL
[8:20:12] <thesaverofhumens> LUL

[8:20:21] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[8:20:25] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> he died to nothing....
[8:20:25] <%MaybeFalco> that scarab is just health i think
[8:20:27] <%Valdorick> Its health flasks Kappa
[8:20:28] <%Pookiedaexzile> And he waddled A way
[8:20:29] <%dcentii> Big Red wood ball means more heals
[8:20:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> bug parkour
[8:20:30] <%RealThiele> isnt that the color of a flask beetle?
[8:20:30] <+Saggitori> they see me Rollin
[8:20:35] <heartlesshealer> and then he rolls into the shot
[8:20:53] <%Bluwizard21> the erdtree will kick ur ass too btw
[8:21:03] <blue8moon> there should be a dungeon by one of the minor erdtrees
[8:21:17] <%RealThiele> thought he killed this one already
[8:21:19] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You can get to the dragon faster from the beastlord grace
[8:21:22] <Sunstalker> also a tower with a memory stone near the bridge with dragon
[8:21:32] <+PrinceDevian> That avatars so annoying
[8:21:44] <graemecrackers2> lol
[8:21:57] <%dcentii> OTHER DIRECTION BAD IDEA
[8:22:04] <Vermillion129> yea that one is much closer to the dragon
[8:22:09] <%Cynical2DD> Wow theres a telepport?
[8:22:15] <%RealThiele> nah other direction has 2 paths
[8:22:19] <%Broand> eh?
[8:22:31] <Kaito_Cam> that guy gives 80k runes
[8:22:37] <blue8moon> there's a grace right in front of the bridge too LUL
[8:22:41] <%dcentii> black blade kindred is a fuck that I didn't kill until I almost beat the game
[8:22:54] <ape_hawk> its okay, pat, this is a safe space, you can call them souls
[8:22:56] <%RealThiele> 1094 per kill yeyeye
[8:22:58] <%MaybeFalco> you can cheese easily if you feel like spending 15 minutes on the fight
[8:23:02] <CheezeWolf> nice save
[8:23:06] <%JustToWatch> you can cheese him super easy
[8:23:08] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Dont forget to go back for the Erd Seed
[8:23:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> there's a side bit here that I haven't explored
[8:23:14] <Kaito_Cam> I used my mimic to help fight him
[8:23:19] <Sunstalker> Because the place is FUCKED
[8:23:19] <TheHotStuven> Everyone almost falls off that ledge LUL
[8:23:25] <%JustToWatch> like comically easy
[8:23:26] <%MaybeFalco> you whack him from behind and run back inside the sanctum
[8:23:28] <+pabloelenano2> from the inside of the temple
[8:23:28] <penitentpendant> I feel that this zone appeals more to 'big empty plains' than the denser starter zone
[8:23:31] <MuFuzzy649> asit should its dead
[8:23:34] <Kaito_Cam> Mimic also uses HP instead of FP so anyone can use it.
[8:23:39] <+crimsonomen0> Have you met the cool wolf/panther man from the loading screen yet?
[8:23:43] <Kaito_Cam> but be warned it takes like half your hp
[8:23:45] <penitentpendant> Although 'plains' is probably not the right word for it
[8:23:48] <+imthewisejanitor> Ussy, bussy, bussiful.
[8:23:50] <+nicversus> You could always try fingers but hole
[8:23:54] <it_came_from_outer_space> ha
[8:23:54] <%JustToWatch> I beat him at like level 20
[8:23:55] <%RealThiele> this dragon fucks
[8:23:55] <+imthinkingdarbys> lmao
[8:23:56] <CheezeWolf> good start
[8:23:56] <%Kevlar_Caviar> LUL
[8:23:56] <%boggsz12> He is real
[8:23:57] <%Bluwizard21> yeah
[8:24:00] <+PrinceDevian> LUL
[8:24:00] <%KnifeyMcEdge> LUL
[8:24:01] <%Broand> yep thats real
[8:24:01] <%dcentii> Greyll is for super real
[8:24:02] <GrenYena> Obliterated
[8:24:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> he's super real
[8:24:03] <%Pookiedaexzile> Dassa Big boy
[8:24:03] <blue8moon> for real dragon LUL
[8:24:04] <%Zundelle> look how real this dragon is
[8:24:05] <+Grayhammatter> good start
[8:24:05] <rudiciuscaesar> for it saying flying dragon, he should didn't do a lot of that
[8:24:06] <+grip_fast> LUL
[8:24:06] <+LandOfTheWay> well then
[8:24:09] <Kaito_Cam> LUL
[8:24:15] <%Ynkubus_> he real
[8:24:22] <+TomDanksEGOT> do you like imagine dragons?
[8:24:23] <+Grayhammatter> that's a real ass dragon
[8:24:28] <Kaito_Cam> that dragon said stay off my bridge
[8:24:29] <+imthewisejanitor> T-bagged
[8:24:38] <thesaverofhumens> time for StinkyCheese
[8:24:38] <%MaybeFalco> after like 20-30 seconds his aggro will reset and you'll be able to hit him in the back again, works with every field boss
[8:24:39] <%Valdorick> @rudiciuscaesar Nah, its not that he flies, its that he sends bitches who step on his bridge flying.
[8:24:40] <+imthewisejanitor> Rectum
[8:24:40] <Sunstalker> god ROT is gonna get nerfed so bad
[8:24:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> he's so real they built a second bridge after he moved in
[8:24:51] <penitentpendant> That's some range
[8:24:53] <+crimsonomen0> Flying Dragon? Like there’s a “Crawling Dragon Greg” somewhere?
[8:24:58] <%pinkslimegoblin> los some tail hairs on that one
[8:25:00] <+nicversus> tea bagon
[8:25:00] <+Grayhammatter> sheesh, that range
[8:25:08] <rudiciuscaesar> @Valdorick oh that's good, I like that.
[8:25:12] <Kaito_Cam> how long does scarlet rot last on bosses?
[8:25:21] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @crimsonomen0 yes, actually!
[8:25:24] <%dcentii> every hit he has will one shot you at this level
[8:25:25] <%MaybeFalco> and i think even if you run away and de-aggro, rot should still tick down
[8:25:28] <+pabloelenano2> solid 5 minutes
[8:25:33] <%RealThiele> rot lasts on bosses for like 2 minutes
[8:25:39] <+simmsyfart> has pat fought radhann yet
[8:25:41] <+imthewisejanitor> You almost had him.
[8:25:41] <Kaito_Cam> Damn
[8:25:43] <@Ranryu692> I thought I just found a Church of Dragon Communism, and got very excited
[8:25:53] <Sunstalker> missed LUL
[8:25:54] <%RealThiele> pat hasnt fought Radahn iirc
[8:26:21] <RyuuAoi> What is this Sonic Adventure 2 Battle BS!?
[8:26:27] <+imthewisejanitor> Sick, not just do that 28 times.
[8:26:30] <+imthewisejanitor> now*
[8:26:33] <%dcentii> I would just rot and run it is super not worth to hit him
[8:26:37] <+TomDanksEGOT> youre immune for the mounting and dismounting animations of Torrent
[8:26:37] <thesaverofhumens> for something called a flying dragon he sure doesnt fly a lot
[8:26:42] <Kaito_Cam> I picture it you just coughing on em really hard
[8:26:44] <%RealThiele> nah rot will do most of the work now
[8:27:03] <+TomDanksEGOT> or I frames
[8:27:08] <Vermillion129> F
[8:27:13] <penitentpendant> Good tracking on that attack
[8:27:19] <Ghufufin> jelly for bleed?
[8:27:20] <Sigma_190_Beta> Hey, you're getting someplace with it.
[8:27:22] <CheezeWolf> this time for sure
[8:27:23] <+thesw1tch> that scarlet rot doing work tho
[8:27:26] <RyuuAoi> You've got this, Pat. That was less than half health
[8:27:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> u wont
[8:27:30] <Samhotdamn> I believe.
[8:27:30] <digaogrunge> Summon someone
[8:27:36] <%MaybeFalco> also another pro tip, coming from an iron pineapple vid, you get i-frames when you summon and slowly get off your horse
[8:27:37] <thesaverofhumens> if he beat foreskin he can beat this
[8:27:39] <Kaito_Cam> wait a minute that's a wyvern
[8:27:40] <Foopoof> Dew it poos poos
[8:27:41] <+imthewisejanitor> Alright but you're actually getting there though.
[8:27:51] <%Bluwizard21> super fast jellyfish
[8:27:53] <%RealThiele> goodbte runes
[8:27:56] <Vermillion129> wao
[8:27:56] <%Bluwizard21> super slow pat
[8:28:00] <%Valdorick> This guy might be too real.
[8:28:08] <KasiCrafter> Bye bye souls
[8:28:09] <digaogrunge> rip runes
[8:28:14] <%RealThiele> wasnt 29k enough for a level?
[8:28:15] <Sigma_190_Beta> 26K I think.
[8:28:17] <+Ravenian96> chump change
[8:28:19] <%dcentii> ye this guy also gives like 85k
[8:28:19] <leaplearning> rip runes
[8:28:20] <Foopoof> Burned the patussy right off LUL
[8:28:22] <penitentpendant> If it's not a level, it matter's little~
[8:28:24] <%Valdorick> 30K runes, or as they call it, 30 midgets.
[8:28:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> that's only like 3 harvests from the farm
[8:28:29] <+imthewisejanitor> Quick, use your AK-47.
[8:28:34] <armadaofghosts> COME FORTH JELLY
[8:28:51] <%Valdorick> @Foopoof Made the Patussy sweaty
[8:28:54] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I would love a tally of the millions of souls pat has lost
[8:28:55] <Kaito_Cam> I just realized that this isn't a dragon technically
[8:29:13] <%RealThiele> yea hes a drake
[8:29:23] <Sigma_190_Beta> Jelly is so fucking tanky.,
[8:29:23] <%Bluwizard21> jelly doin work
[8:29:23] <%Pookiedaexzile> Lightning from afar
[8:29:26] <Sigma_190_Beta> Like fuck.
[8:29:26] <+Ravenian96> he identifies as a dragon
[8:29:29] <Samhotdamn> Jelly is my favorite
[8:29:33] <Kaito_Cam> @RealThiele Wyvern
[8:29:39] <+Grayhammatter> holy shit, that damage
[8:29:41] <+Saggitori> her name is Aurelia
[8:29:49] <%RealThiele> no spikes on the tail so Wyvern unlikely
[8:29:50] <Vermillion129> scarlet rot doing work
[8:29:55] <graemecrackers2> not alot of flying
[8:29:56] <+Ravenian96> coward strats OP
[8:29:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> this isn't Dark Souls, these are dragons
[8:30:02] <+imthewisejanitor> Are we gonna get into the technicalities of a magical summoned jellyfish, too?
[8:30:04] <%dcentii> they call everything a dragon in this game except for the magma wyrms, but there are definitely "real" dragons, like the one in the trailers
[8:30:09] <Ghufufin> we're going to be here for a while
[8:30:18] <+bone_reaper69> none of the dragon tails drop weapons do they?
[8:30:21] <Vermillion129> WOW
[8:30:23] <muerphy> Wyvirn not a drag
[8:30:23] <%strakillias> prometheus
[8:30:23] <+nicversus> aw man
[8:30:24] <$OfficerMods> good going greyll
[8:30:28] <RubberFistFight> the range on the dragon's fire is kind of unreasonable
[8:30:31] <Sigma_190_Beta> @bone_reaper69 Nope.
[8:30:34] <$OfficerMods> get that cheesing poo poo man
[8:30:34] <+ChiuTheFat> has Rot always been that effective in other FS games?
[8:30:35] <Foopoof> That fire is hot
[8:30:35] <superdude22> numotGRIEF
[8:30:36] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @bone_reaper69 sadly they do not
[8:30:38] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> does your weapon have bleed?
[8:30:38] <+nicversus> Have you tried fingers but hole?
[8:30:39] <%dcentii> I wasn't able to cut off any tails so prob not
[8:30:44] <%greasypete00> "wouldnt it be funny if he got immediate;y killed after that?"
[8:30:45] <%MaybeFalco> dont worry pat, i choked two times in a row on this boss when it was one hit away from death
[8:30:46] <+imthewisejanitor> SUPA hot.
[8:30:47] <RubberFistFight> very much DS2 ancient dragon "fire can hit the entire platform" shenanigans
[8:30:49] <%Puhff> rip 30k runes
[8:30:53] <KasiCrafter> Muple Rot DoTs
[8:31:00] <%JustToWatch> rot that dragussy
[8:31:00] <%pinkslimegoblin> eat his rotussy
[8:31:08] <%RealThiele> zapping system active
[8:31:09] <KasiCrafter> What about your Physic flask, Pat?
[8:31:18] <Sunstalker> ChiuTheFat Rot hasn't existed before. There's been Toxic or others but never this strong
[8:31:24] <+imthewisejanitor> Get the flying dragussy
[8:31:29] <+nicversus> bust out the KY Jellyfish, lube up the rotussy
[8:31:37] <%boggsz12> the free hit would
[8:31:42] <Kaito_Cam> @RealThiele drakes are usually lesser wyverns this is one is an aadult
[8:31:42] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt You only need to tank one attack, so put on the shield.
[8:31:46] <graemecrackers2> XD
[8:31:53] <%MaybeFalco> it REALLY negates damage
[8:31:55] <digaogrunge> The free hit one
[8:32:10] <Kaito_Cam> you get 1 free hit
[8:32:13] <muerphy> Dragussy sounds like my unks stagename
[8:32:30] <kryptotheskald> @imthewisejanitor I think you mean the drussy.
[8:32:39] <RubberFistFight> "Ok odd groups got left, even groups got right. That's 1357 left, 2468 right. 7 and 8 are whelp groups. Ok listen the fuck up! You are going to DPS it VERY SLOWLY Now, and by slowly I mean FUCKING slow. If you get aggro, it means you are going to lose 50DKP cause you didn't know what the fuck to do."
[8:32:41] <%RealThiele> well it worked
[8:32:57] <graemecrackers2> yo look at that dragon penis you know GRRM worked on it
[8:32:58] <roguemephilesclone> You literally threw yourself into its mouth.
[8:33:08] <+thesw1tch> you got any fire resistant shit?
[8:33:18] <blue8moon> ye
[8:33:19] <peachy996> I very much enjoy your deathscream
[8:33:20] <penitentpendant> Yup, back to the ole days of Dark Souls
[8:33:25] <penitentpendant> A win's a win~
[8:33:26] <%pinkslimegoblin> choese
[8:33:26] <thesaverofhumens> anything in the game is fair I think
[8:33:27] <Kaito_Cam> it'd be really funny if you could replace the sound of the scarlet rot roar with a guy coughing really badly
[8:33:44] <%Bluwizard21> yeah, faith seems to be a troll build now. just spam statuses and run away
[8:33:46] <MidnightPacif1c> does breath talisman boost rot damage significantly
[8:33:55] <%RealThiele> until you get some losers that are like 1v1 me no items final abyss destiantion
[8:33:59] <Sunstalker> See, shield is nice
[8:34:01] <Kaito_Cam> Man I'm tryna win fuck being fair.
[8:34:09] <%MaybeFalco> anything is fair, including hitting the field boss with rot, running away like a coward, and waiting for it to die from a distance
[8:34:18] <azure_dunes> just got hit with my second fucking transporter trap
[8:34:23] <muerphy> Has anyone 100%  Yet?
[8:34:34] <%The_Protagonist> *oh*
[8:34:37] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @muerphy fuck no
[8:34:46] <Kaito_Cam> Is the boss dead? then who cares how it died.
[8:34:49] <+Ravenian96> I beat the game, but nowhere near 100% lol
[8:34:54] <digaogrunge> honse is needed
[8:34:55] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt in the words of frankenstein, fire bad
[8:35:03] <%mongorific> mongorific subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Im 32 hours in and am beginning my real quest into Caelid and the tournament. Big Halberdman go poke
[8:35:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> he came down in a freakin bubble dawg
[8:35:13] <%MaybeFalco> @muerphy gene was working on it i think
[8:35:21] <Sunstalker> You can lure him to the grace area and fight him outside of the bridge. If he goes much further he just teleports back to bridge
[8:35:28] <%Puhff> Wonder why this one is so stronk
[8:35:30] <Kaito_Cam> Did anyone else skip castle redmane?
[8:35:34] <graemecrackers2> maybe hes upset due to his dry skin ?
[8:35:54] <+Edrem> @Kaito_Cam you mean the bug that causes nothing to spawn there?
[8:35:57] <muerphy> So whats da lore
[8:36:04] <Kaito_Cam> I beat 2 demigods and started ranni's quest and when i went to the castle it was just open
[8:36:11] <%MaybeFalco> totally doable
[8:36:14] <+Grayhammatter> jelly doing work
[8:36:25] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> do rot and poison stack?
[8:36:28] <+twenty112> He haaaaaaates it
[8:36:49] <rudiciuscaesar> this is definitely the coolest large most fight I've ever seen
[8:36:54] <thesaverofhumens> horse fried
[8:36:54] <%The_Protagonist> in the immortal words of Professor Farnsworth "fire indeed hot"
[8:36:55] <sirrice77> @Kaito_Cam Because the festival is available, you can go earlier but then it'll be closed and you have to find a way in and so on
[8:36:55] <graemecrackers2> lol
[8:36:56] <+Ravenian96> fire tickled horse butt
[8:36:57] <Holofono> LUL
[8:36:57] <%mongorific> Horse ded
[8:36:59] <$Mekhet09> Torrent died.
[8:36:59] <penitentpendant> Did... the hit reaction from the wing knock you off Torrent?
[8:36:59] <%RealThiele> ive found it easiest on dragon fights to bait out that ground cone
[8:37:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> horse died?
[8:37:00] <+DoctorDerp388> you died
[8:37:01] <RubberFistFight> i think the wing clipped you
[8:37:01] <%hermitsen> looked like horse died
[8:37:01] <%Frostofthecwsw> bullshit
[8:37:02] <Sigma_190_Beta> The fire hit you from behind I think.
[8:37:02] <+pabloelenano2> ghost hitbox of fire behind
[8:37:02] <%Pookiedaexzile> Fire Killed your Horse
[8:37:02] <%pinkslimegoblin> fuckin bullsjit
[8:37:03] <+Krash_Override> @ReallyBigRocks and what was HER sister? Huh?
[8:37:04] <rudiciuscaesar> like trying to joust a dargon
[8:37:05] <graemecrackers2> eldin ring happened
[8:37:07] <+Grayhammatter> damn, torrent got clipped
[8:37:07] <+nicversus> aw man that was a good run until it wasn't LUL
[8:37:09] <+Edrem> @Kaito_Cam you can go straight to radahn fight, if you want to clear the actual castle you have to use the teleporter from the bridge to get in
[8:37:13] <KasiCrafter> Horse died and made the SHING sound
[8:37:16] <penitentpendant> It IS possible
[8:37:28] <sothatsprettybrutal> No Skill
[8:37:28] <digaogrunge> charge those bolts, he cant dodge
[8:37:34] <RubberFistFight> @penitentpendant yes. All the dragons do that. If I'm being honest, I'm not a fan of it at all and think it's kinda cheap.
[8:37:42] <Sunstalker> @Kaito_Cam You can just sneak int he back actually.
[8:37:47] <RubberFistFight> It makes it especially hard to fight them as a melee
[8:37:50] <+nicversus> Dragon Dragon, rot the dragon
[8:37:59] <penitentpendant> @RubberFistFight Weird form of reactive hitbox
[8:38:12] <RubberFistFight> @penitentpendant it's Dark Souls 2 physics
[8:38:18] <RubberFistFight> I'm not being snarky
[8:38:18] <muerphy> You have to visceral him peen tip
[8:38:24] <RubberFistFight> it happens all the time in that game
[8:38:37] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> yo havnt caught the stream in a while what was the last main boss pat beat so I can avoid spoilers
[8:38:39] <sothatsprettybrutal> scarlet rot is just busted damn
[8:38:39] <rudiciuscaesar> Yeah, that was kind of a bullshit DS2 hitbox, I've seen a few like that
[8:38:46] <RubberFistFight> notice how the wing-in-flight literally just went through pat then?
[8:38:47] <penitentpendant> @RubberFistFight It's been a while since I played DS2
[8:38:49] <+Edrem> sneaking in the back causes the bug where castle is empty, not sure how they intended that part to be done
[8:38:53] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> jelly putting in work
[8:38:58] <penitentpendant> Wow the backdraft
[8:38:58] <%MaybeFalco> its bouncing off the side of the bridge 100%
[8:39:00] <rudiciuscaesar> kinda like that
[8:39:02] <sirrice77> @xXRealGamerThaigeXx rennala, on his way to radahn eventually
[8:39:05] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt This is a dark souls 2 dragon, dude
[8:39:05] <%mongorific> psaOno
[8:39:06] <Manwad> the flame seems to be bouncing off the wall
[8:39:07] <%Puhff> WHAT
[8:39:09] <+nicversus> I guess there's like a backdraft
[8:39:11] <%The_Protagonist> psaFist
[8:39:14] <%RealThiele> still doable
[8:39:16] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> @xXRealGamerThaigeXx Thanks!
[8:39:17] <Kaito_Cam> oof
[8:39:19] <rudiciuscaesar> you really gotta get to like his tail to be safe, right?
[8:39:19] <Sunstalker> Edrem Nah, I went in there through the back before ever starting th tournament stuff.
[8:39:21] <+Ravenian96> Get used to getting roasted
[8:39:21] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> How is it killing him
[8:39:24] <digaogrunge> THAT SPLASH IS ABSURD
[8:39:29] <+crocodile_t34rz> Those fire physics are both impressive and infuriating
[8:39:30] <%The_Protagonist> spear him right in the dussy
[8:39:30] <thesaverofhumens> particle physics are really advanced
[8:39:41] <RubberFistFight> @TurtlesAndTentacles hitbox shenanigans
[8:39:45] <+Edrem> @Sunstalker but was there actually people in the town?
[8:39:57] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I vote we nicked name the jelly Peach Jam
[8:39:57] <+crimsonomen0> So you need a decent amount of faith/int/arc to do all the dragon shit?
[8:40:00] <graemecrackers2> the fire rises
[8:40:02] <%MaybeFalco> over in the rot dragon area, there's a bit of plant near the arena, and all the rot breath will go directly up past it, instead of rolling over or through it
[8:40:05] <penitentpendant> The fire gas expansion physics are quite on point for a videogame
[8:40:05] <+Ravenian96> Fire desires Patron
[8:40:17] <thesaverofhumens> @crimsonomen0 or a lot of skill/patience
[8:40:18] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @RubberFistFight Thats so frustrating
[8:40:19] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, how did he not get hit there?
[8:40:22] <$Mekhet09> Is your seal upgraded at all pat?
[8:40:30] <Kaito_Cam> Lightning bolt! ligtning bolt!
[8:40:36] <RubberFistFight> @rudiciuscaesar just about to ask the same thing LUL
[8:40:37] <Sunstalker> Edrem No, not people people, but enemies yeah. Knights, iron virgin, soldiers. Had a boss where the tournament seating is
[8:40:41] <%Monkeyweed21> Never thought I'd see "Big Number" Pat do a DoT build on his first playthrough
[8:40:42] <penitentpendant> He seems to reward 'joust mechanics'
[8:40:59] <+crimsonomen0> @thesaverofhumens I mean the dragon skills, not fighting the actual dragons haha.
[8:41:03] <%MaybeFalco> yeah you got this pat
[8:41:11] <RubberFistFight> "Where is the dragon's hitbox?" "Yes."
[8:41:12] <rudiciuscaesar> @RubberFistFight yeah, these huge bosses with their weird hit boxes and weird hurt boxes
[8:41:20] <penitentpendant> Rot's gone
[8:41:23] <+nicversus> try lightning but hole
[8:41:24] <Gorgs7> the rot stopped
[8:41:28] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> cmon so close!
[8:41:33] <%RealThiele> rot gone should be fine hes at low health
[8:41:39] <penitentpendant> So close!
[8:41:43] <Sunstalker> If you ride towards him, hug left so you have maximum time to swerve right for firesweep
[8:41:45] <muerphy> Ass bolts all day
[8:41:49] <rudiciuscaesar> GOD DAMMIT
[8:41:50] <$Mekhet09> You could have killed him.
[8:41:50] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> noooo
[8:41:50] <Noogiez> nooooooooo
[8:41:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> fuck
[8:41:51] <CheezeWolf> DAMMTI
[8:41:51] <rudiciuscaesar> what
[8:41:54] <+pabloelenano2> so close
[8:41:54] <Sunstalker> *opposite of what I said
[8:41:54] <MightyN7> LUL
[8:41:54] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Fuck
[8:41:56] <+nicversus> aw fuck
[8:41:57] <$Mekhet09> The rot killed you lol.
[8:41:58] <HyperionXV> raysThump
[8:41:59] <+sambws> Lmao
[8:42:01] <vance168> ooooooow felt that from here
[8:42:03] <%Pookiedaexzile> Predictabo
[8:42:05] <digaogrunge> SO CLOSE
[8:42:05] <rudiciuscaesar> did he even do that move once during the match?
[8:42:06] <SarahTsang> so close!
[8:42:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> that breath attack is always a bitch
[8:42:10] <+StallionPupper> when he's that low,just stick to lightning
[8:42:11] <+Ravenian96> he's easier when he doesn't one shot you tbh
[8:42:12] <%mongorific> psaFist
[8:42:23] <thesaverofhumens> what happens if it dies the same time as you
[8:42:24] <+Ravenian96> xD
[8:42:36] <rudiciuscaesar> oh yeah, he does do that....
[8:42:39] <%The_Protagonist> i'm surprised that didn't
[8:42:41] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt remember that time in Dark Souls 2 where the dragon in Heide's Tower literally breathed fire at you through 6 feet of stone at a downward angle? Yeah.
[8:43:18] <rudiciuscaesar> that looked jank!
[8:43:25] <+Ravenian96> it's a weird angle for sure
[8:43:26] <%mongorific> fire bad
[8:43:32] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> the billowing flames are rough
[8:43:38] <%RealThiele> ffire bloom hurt
[8:43:38] <%Monkeyweed21> PHYSIX
[8:43:45] <CheezeWolf> sayuwuThisIsFine
[8:43:46] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I have never been more angry at a game and Im not the one playing
[8:43:48] <rudiciuscaesar> can you use a bow on Torrent? Like, Mongol horse archer this dragon to death
[8:43:49] <%Monkeyweed21> the fire has Physussy
[8:43:59] <muerphy> Thats a drake damnit
[8:44:04] <%Monkeyweed21> @rudiciuscaesar yes
[8:44:06] <%Bluwizard21> Good times, when we knew what love was and the world was so much smaller
[8:44:08] <+crimsonomen0> Jellyfish just chilling, going about his day, and is suddenly thrown into a fight with a dragon as fodder. Rough.
[8:44:27] <rudiciuscaesar> @Monkeyweed21 yeah, Parthian shot this bitch dragon
[8:44:27] <+imthinkingdarbys> i love how it's head perks up like a dog when it notices you
[8:44:39] <rudiciuscaesar> with his...mock feathers?
[8:44:45] <%MaybeFalco> i tweeted some equally stupid bullshit at you
[8:44:50] <CheezeWolf> that one doesnt count halosweetHeadpat
[8:44:52] <thesaverofhumens> somehow I dont think the jellyfish is helping
[8:44:53] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> F for dog
[8:45:03] <penitentpendant> Dog has ascended to sleep
[8:45:05] <heartlesshealer> baby slep
[8:45:07] <RubberFistFight> @TurtlesAndTentacles ALL of the dragons are like this. It's horseshit. However the mystery evaporates when you find out that apparently a lot of the people who worked on DS2 worked on this as well.
[8:45:08] <+Ravenian96> OLEG
[8:45:08] <Gorgs7> oh no! Gief!!
[8:45:09] <rudiciuscaesar> Dog is eternal, never dead
[8:45:10] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> It felt like it was
[8:45:19] <Ghufufin> have u tried the arcae archer lady?
[8:45:23] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat needs to infect the Dragussy with his taint rot
[8:45:25] <+crimsonomen0> Jellyfish probably tired of getting dunked on too.
[8:45:27] <graemecrackers2> who would want to hurt a poor dragon ? we sure live near some weirdos.
[8:45:28] <@QueequegTheater> Ah yes, the two genders, Oleg and Jellyfish
[8:45:31] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @RubberFistFight Welp lol
[8:45:31] <tanarath> If you have to reapply it, only channel the rot breath for 2 cycles not 3
[8:45:34] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> hey oleg doing damage
[8:45:34] <plaguedoctor_vi> the way i usually fight dragons is that i mount on the horse give one attack then back the fuck away, it helps evede their attacks
[8:45:43] <%MaybeFalco> oleg might be better for this kinda, since the jellyfish will try to stick close to you at all times
[8:45:48] <Sunstalker> Ride back off the bridge
[8:45:48] <%RealThiele> flask!
[8:46:04] <digaogrunge> DRINK YOUR JUICE
[8:46:10] <+Ravenian96> oleg doesn't get paid enough for this shit
[8:46:10] <%discoinfierno> Hard to say, I'm assuming the jellyfish keeps him from having to reapply rot several times
[8:46:10] <RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater man, now people are gonna draw pictures...
[8:46:18] <penitentpendant> @RubberFistFight I think the funny thing is you can tell the Dragon is trapped in the bridge's 'sky box' whenever it flies up
[8:46:20] <RubberFistFight> HOW
[8:46:20] <+crimsonomen0> Knights and dragons are like cats and dogs. Jellyfish and dragons, not so much.
[8:46:24] <RubberFistFight> HOW DID YOU SURVIVE THAT
[8:46:30] <%The_Protagonist> wow that was close haha
[8:46:33] <%The_Protagonist> aaaaaaaaaaand
[8:46:34] <RubberFistFight> THE FIRE WAS ON YOUR LEGS
[8:46:34] <rudiciuscaesar> WOAHHHHH
[8:46:37] <%The_Protagonist> nevermind
[8:46:38] <%Kevlar_Caviar> saw someone on twitter say that you NEED to grind to 30+ in order to beat margit and anyone saying otherwise is being a "dudebro". can we have one fromsoft game that isn't bombarded by awful takes?
[8:46:39] <%dcentii> no
[8:46:39] <Sunstalker> No, too big
[8:46:41] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt I don't think you've used your hit.
[8:46:44] <RyuuAoi> Clip it
[8:46:45] <Sigma_190_Beta> Nevermind.
[8:46:45] <%boggsz12> remember the physick
[8:46:47] <rudiciuscaesar> DS2 hurtboxes indeed
[8:46:48] <Vermillion129> this lizard is no joke
[8:46:49] <CheezeWolf> this game is nuts
[8:46:50] <%pinkslimegoblin> I fight dragons by stunlocking them with a katana
[8:46:51] <RyuuAoi> Fucking bugs
[8:46:51] <+xXRealGamerThaigeXx> that sure was a hitbox
[8:46:56] <muerphy> Robbed
[8:46:56] <Sunstalker> I think you can roll it but that's it
[8:47:05] <%MaybeFalco> the shield will also wear out after a certain period of time if you don't get hit
[8:47:16] <%MaybeFalco> something like 2 minutes?
[8:47:19] <%dcentii> I find dragons much easier on foot but maybe thats cause im crazy
[8:47:25] <Ghufufin> @Kevlar_Caviar lol
[8:47:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> the range
[8:47:35] <CheezeWolf> rip oleg halosweetRIP
[8:47:40] <graemecrackers2> much fire
[8:47:49] <Kaito_Cam> Burn baby burn!
[8:47:54] <heartlesshealer> wow oleg can take one whole fire breath and stick around
[8:48:03] <+crimsonomen0> Oleg emerges from the fire, unscathed and now angry. What a Chad.
[8:48:13] <+imthinkingdarbys> @Kevlar_Caviar i did margit first try at lvl 12 and i'm bad at these games
[8:48:26] <+Ravenian96> WINNABLE
[8:48:26] <%RealThiele> bubble remained!
[8:48:27] <Kaito_Cam> I got my wind  up vrtra today
[8:48:28] <CheezeWolf> OLEG!!!! yuniiCry
[8:48:30] <KasiCrafter> Literally free Pog
[8:48:32] <heartlesshealer> bye oleg
[8:48:33] <%MaybeFalco> only torrent got hit since you jumpued
[8:48:41] <RubberFistFight> foot apparently didn't count as a hurtbox there randomly for some reason
[8:48:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> in a freakin bubble
[8:48:42] <+nicversus> right in the but hole
[8:48:43] <Maids4lyfe> spear the dragon taint
[8:48:44] <rudiciuscaesar> the fact that his lightning spear has a limited range kinda infuriates me. Like, I could get fire or magic, but lightning feels like if anything's gonna have super range, it'll be lightning
[8:48:48] <RubberFistFight> wing didn't count there
[8:48:51] <RubberFistFight> this fight is BROKEN
[8:48:54] <Kaito_Cam> been listening to your answer on looo like all day.
[8:49:03] <penitentpendant> 75% done
[8:49:13] <RubberFistFight> @rudiciuscaesar yeah they gave the dragons this fucking ABSURD breath attack and then make sure you can't hit them from outside its range
[8:49:15] <Kaito_Cam> can you cough on the horse?
[8:49:20] <+Ravenian96> Smart
[8:49:24] <CheezeWolf> good call
[8:49:28] <RubberFistFight> that combined with the god-awful boxes just makes them atrocious to fight
[8:49:33] <%Kevlar_Caviar> rot ran out already??
[8:49:38] <+sambws> I saw peeve do this earlier with a dagger
[8:49:42] <rudiciuscaesar> @RubberFistFight and then you know you can't hit it with a bow cuz you gotta pull the string back all the way
[8:49:50] <%The_Protagonist> @Kevlar_Caviar it didn't pop again
[8:50:02] <RubberFistFight> @rudiciuscaesar yup.
[8:50:10] <CheezeWolf> no rot?? 🤨
[8:50:10] <penitentpendant> I mean, it's a ton of damage so that's fair
[8:50:13] <$SGrim> Or there might be a resistance build-up
[8:50:24] <Sunstalker> I think everything builds up higher resist once they get anything inflicted
[8:50:28] <Kaito_Cam> He's built up anti-bodies!
[8:50:37] <%RealThiele> lightning doin work tho
[8:50:40] <%linSP> dog is dead mariaG
[8:50:41] <%dcentii> ez
[8:50:43] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> You can rot again just need more
[8:50:43] <+Ravenian96> WOOOOOO

[8:51:23] <muerphy> Fuk yooooooooooooo dragon couch
[8:51:27] <+pabloelenano2> wait
[8:51:30] <Sigma_190_Beta> I'd say wait.
[8:51:31] <Vermillion129> I'd say wait
[8:51:32] <%MaybeFalco> i'd wait
[8:51:36] <+ParadisusFalls> Has he fought the BIG dragon?
[8:51:46] <luciluxlu0> the magic breath is great against another dragon
[8:51:46] <kryptotheskald> Congrats Pat!
[8:51:46] <+crimsonomen0> There’s a church AND a cathedral? Okay.
[8:51:53] <%discoinfierno> isn't there the lightning dragon from the trailer still?
[8:51:53] <%RealThiele> yes big dragon is ded
[8:51:54] <%MaybeFalco> the big fuck off one in altus?
[8:51:57] <digaogrunge> Can you get all? Are there enough hearts?
[8:52:01] <CheezeWolf> 80k onigiriBaller
[8:52:03] <Vermillion129> fought the big dragon or butt slap the big dragon
[8:52:06] <%Bluwizard21> whatcha gonna do now?
[8:52:08] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You won't fight the named ice dragon for a long while
[8:52:12] <+Ravenian96> typically you get a new dragon heart when you unlock new dragon abilities, so you don't have to wait
[8:52:23] <Sunstalker> It's funny that the Cathedral is smaller and more ruined then the Dragon Church
[8:52:29] <penitentpendant> Fashion Souls Returns!
[8:52:35] <%dcentii> RADAHN TIME LEZZGO
[8:52:41] <%Kevlar_Caviar> FINALLY
[8:52:43] <%Bluwizard21> oh fuck
[8:52:46] <Vermillion129> OH HERE WE GO
[8:52:51] <muerphy> Take a poop in its mouth
[8:52:54] <%RealThiele> somber [5] is oddly difficult to find
[8:52:56] <+sambws> This shit is fucked
[8:52:56] <+Ravenian96> Naw beat him ez
[8:52:58] <CheezeWolf> parano137Tinyeye
[8:52:59] <Vermillion129> that's enough for me
[8:52:59] <$Jaxnos> i just beat him. my body is dust.
[8:52:59] <MidnightPacif1c> :)
[8:53:03] <%MaybeFalco> take the teleporter
[8:53:05] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Remember to fix your flasks.
[8:53:06] <%Pookiedaexzile> First Try here we go
[8:53:07] <Ghufufin> first try lets go!
[8:53:12] <CheezeWolf> I mean at least give it one go LUL
[8:53:13] <TheSphereHunter> are you ready for Radahn tho???
[8:53:16] <%dcentii> Pat might have an easy time with his cheese build but not sure
[8:53:16] <%RealThiele> take the teleporter behind you
[8:53:16] <armadaofghosts> He's quite  asight, for sure.
[8:53:16] <+Gregmeyer> just one shot him
[8:53:16] <sirrice77> sure the cutscenes are cool
[8:53:17] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt yeah but you're gonna want to fight him at least once, once you see him. You won't be able to resist :P
[8:53:19] <%pinkslimegoblin> one shot radahn ez
[8:53:19] <Sunstalker> go around right
[8:53:19] <+Edrem> teleporter by the bridge is shortcut
[8:53:19] <pi_in_the_sci> You're gonna die a couple times before you get a real look at him
[8:53:19] <+sambws> Tried for 45 min on Radhan with no luck, gonna try tomorrow
[8:53:20] <+crimsonomen0> I fought the lightning dragon in the northwest by the coffin bonfire. He dipped like halfway through the fight. Haven’t seen him since.
[8:53:22] <heartlesshealer> you got it right the first time you said it
[8:53:22] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> You beating him then
[8:53:23] <RyuuAoi> Only 12:53 here. We got time!
[8:53:25] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt the teleporter
[8:53:27] <kryptotheskald> 2 AM, optimal boss fight time.
[8:53:28] <graemecrackers2> 2 AM is for the risk takers
[8:53:28] <@Spydurman> one shotting him, got it
[8:53:30] <%Felhad> Fucking finally got the Valiant G's down, fuck that fight
[8:53:32] <penitentpendant> I mean, I mentally have to keep saying myself: Not the guy from Ul'dah whenever his name comes up
[8:53:37] <%greasypete00> you know you missed a grace in the castle earlier?
[8:53:46] <%zarkazeon> you w9nt get to with how small ur health is O.o
[8:53:52] <%greasypete00> when you were teleported in
[8:54:11] <Sunstalker> other way pat
[8:54:16] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt No up my man the other way
[8:54:18] <%MaybeFalco> other way
[8:54:18] <%Felhad> Prepare for 2-fists but hole
[8:54:20] <%dcentii> welcome to empty castle with 2 lions
[8:54:27] <%MaybeFalco> yeah you get a free ticket to radahn
[8:54:34] <%MaybeFalco> yeah
[8:54:36] <Sunstalker> Because radahn quest/fight
[8:54:38] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> The festival
[8:54:40] <luciluxlu0> it's the festival
[8:54:42] <Sunstalker> this is mandatory
[8:54:47] <graemecrackers2> halo music ?
[8:54:49] <blue8moon> the festival
[8:54:50] <Kaito_Cam> Yeah festival
[8:54:53] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt No radahn is batshit insane and noone wants to be near a guy that literally eats anyone near him
[8:54:54] <%dcentii> @PatStaresAt after a certain point in the game the castle becomes empty because of the Radahn festival
[8:55:00] <+Ravenian96> small dungeon
[8:55:01] <%MaybeFalco> very short dungeon
[8:55:02] <Sunstalker> yeah, smaller then stormveil though
[8:55:03] <Kaito_Cam> you skip having to actually fight 2 bosses at the same time.
[8:55:04] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> nah
[8:55:05] <+jennyfurific> a mini legacy dungeon
[8:55:12] <%Felhad> Its pretty small compared to the other Legacies, but yeah
[8:55:12] <sirrice77> Because festival is up i think, it doesnt trigger till you beat rennala or 2 story bosses maybe
[8:55:13] <plaguedoctor_vi> the dungeon is the fight
[8:55:15] <%Pookiedaexzile> Halo
[8:55:22] <RedBlossomail> small dungeon with a nice reward
[8:55:22] <Sunstalker> you can come back after festival and clear it all, plus repalcement boss
[8:55:26] <casualbaloth> Halo
[8:55:28] <%discoinfierno> empty makes this much cooler
[8:55:28] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt now go say hello to the peopl that will be carrying you through this boss fight
[8:55:30] <%dcentii> This is the hypest part of any souls game imo
[8:55:32] <Vermillion129> wait this is suppose to be a dungeon? I came here and it's like this
[8:55:33] <Sunstalker> Also you can come find Flamberge here outside the festival
[8:55:34] <+Ravenian96> I don't want to spoil
[8:55:34] <blue8moon> I know it's like this for me and I haven't beat rennala LUL
[8:55:37] <%Zundelle> yeah I had to fight a bunch of dudes and a boss fight where there were 2 enemies with boss health
[8:55:42] <%MaybeFalco> its really jank
[8:55:52] <penitentpendant> Alexander!
[8:55:55] <Kaito_Cam> this is a boss areana
[8:55:56] <+Edrem> after the festival you cannot use the grace to teleport in, have to use teleporter again
[8:55:57] <%Monkeyweed21> DOG DADDY
[8:55:57] <$Mekhet09> Is this redmane castle?
[8:55:58] <sirrice77> @blue8moon did you beat 2 main bosses?
[8:56:00] <%RealThiele> hi guts
[8:56:00] <%boggsz12> if you come here earlier or without that quest you get to fight a misbegotten leonine and a crucible knight at the same time. it's a bitch
[8:56:04] <rudiciuscaesar> his voice sounds familiar....
[8:56:16] <Gorgs7> Hi Blaidd, I'm cosplaying as you! -Pat

[8:56:56] <$Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt if you don't do this now now you have fight one misbegotten and one crucible knight and it is as horrible as it seems.
[8:56:57] <+Ravenian96> REJOICE

[9:04:59] <+pabloelenano2> he is on a tiny horse
[9:05:00] <%boggsz12> he's a fucking one piece character
[9:05:01] <Vermillion129> he ride a pony
[9:05:01] <Kaito_Cam> The summon signs also come back after a while
[9:05:01] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> it was in the cut scene
[9:05:04] <+thickshield> its very small. he loves his horse
[9:05:04] <%MaybeFalco> he has no feet
[9:05:05] <%epide> and yeah its like a donkey
[9:05:06] <+Ingenk> My favorite is when he leaves the horse for a moment
[9:05:07] <KasiCrafter> Don't forget to drink your Physic!
[9:05:10] <$Stari> YOU CAN RESUMMON  PEOPLE IF THEY DIE
[9:05:10] <+dougtert> SPEAKING OF: Use yours
[9:05:10] <%SuckerPunchSyd> He’s on a horse its so small
[9:05:11] <heartlesshealer> That huge man is riding the same emaciated horse from the cutscene
[9:05:11] <muerphy> Think armored core
[9:05:12] <%justcallmebobplease> Pat it was literally featured, only thing on the screen, during that cutscene the guy just told you.
[9:05:18] <+tussletoes> radahn is just a lil quirky like that
[9:05:19] <Kaito_Cam> Horse also works here
[9:05:19] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Its bones are so brittle
[9:05:24] <Vermillion129> God I know this fight is kinda ass but I love it so much
[9:05:24] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I dont think Rot would work in him right?
[9:05:25] <%justcallmebobplease> You saw his stumbling tiny horse and nothing else on screen - what did you see, if not the tiny horse?
[9:05:26] <%Eldalu> are his feet gone? they look like nubs
[9:05:30] <+Local16> seeing rot work on him means I know what I'm doing tomorrow
[9:05:31] <rudiciuscaesar> at first I thought the boss was like a Dwemer sphere from Skyrim cuz of how he's slipping nad sliding all over the battlefield but then you can see the little horsey
[9:05:33] <Sunstalker> God even radhan's attacks are shit you'd see in kenshiro
[9:05:42] <%Valdorick> Oh wow, I have NEVER seen him 2 two volleys
[9:05:48] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i swear to god if pat beats this tonight i'm gonna be so mad
[9:05:53] <+tussletoes> HONSE
[9:05:55] <+crocodile_t34rz> Ganon?
[9:05:55] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I will thoroughly enjoy watching you beat this boss later today, also patches doesnt do a goddamn thing he leaves immediately
[9:05:56] <%epide> yup the healer
[9:05:57] <Sunstalker> PACTHES LuL
[9:05:58] <RubberFistFight> [PATCHES HAS RETURNED TO HIS WORLD]

[9:06:07] <Omenaire_> WHY

[9:06:08] <LuminusVows> LUL
[9:06:08] <ohno58> That horse is tired
[9:06:09] <fortheboyzs> poor horsey
[9:06:10] <%RealThiele> patches gtfo
[9:06:11] <%dcentii> yeah you can't just do that in his face if you ain't full health
[9:06:11] <+Tredecian> the horse is the real mvp
[9:06:11] <RubberFistFight> lol Patches takes one look and cowards the fuck out
[9:06:12] <+pabloelenano2> this is the bets ever
[9:06:12] <+Based_Moose> Why does this fight remind me of fate/unlimited bladeworks?
[9:06:13] <digaogrunge> PATCHES LEAVES
[9:06:14] <+dougtert> the horse is his best friend and he rides it with gravity magic
[9:06:15] <+LandOfTheWay> PATCHES JUST BAILS ON YOU LUL
[9:06:15] <@QueequegTheater> PATCHES HAS RETURNED TO HIS WORLD
[9:06:16] <Vermillion129> LUL
[9:06:16] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Patches Leaves.
[9:06:17] <+retrohazard> He is the bone of his sword
[9:06:17] <Sunstalker> (Patches left your world )
[9:06:17] <+tussletoes> i have seen patches get summoned and immediately fuck off back to his world lol
[9:06:17] <+Grayhammatter> patches just left
[9:06:18] <+crocodile_t34rz> How is that horse's back not broken?
[9:06:18] <djblue_shift> it's great
[9:06:19] <sun312772> a raid fitting a festival
[9:06:20] <ImTrin> horse mvp
[9:06:20] <+Gregmeyer> and the horse has LORE
[9:06:21] <+eanscrale> untethered indeed
[9:06:22] <%boggsz12> it moves so quickly while it's carrying this fuck-off huge dude
[9:06:23] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> That horse is emaciated lol
[9:06:24] <+tussletoes> PATCHES DIPPED
[9:06:25] <%Kevlar_Caviar> PATCHES HAS RETURNED TO HIS WORLD
[9:06:25] <urkleturtle> it's a normal-sized horse, but he's HUGE
[9:06:26] <graemecrackers2> He's a Brony XD
[9:06:26] <%tetraes> i feel the summons make this harder
[9:06:26] <%boggsz12> like he's drifting on it
[9:06:27] <heartlesshealer> Patches runs away LUL
[9:06:28] <+FadingEmber> that horse is fighting for its life LUL
[9:06:29] <%YakumoYomi> WILD AND PURE AND FOREVER FREE!
[9:06:29] <%MaybeFalco> btw pat most of his attacks will one shot you aside from the arrow ones unless you don't half full health
[9:06:29] <Kaito_Cam> Patches left kuz he died
[9:06:30] <plaguedoctor_vi> the horse becomes wholsome after you read the lore
[9:06:31] <%epide> it reminds me of that one one piece doc
[9:06:31] <+pugszerosugar> Hol horse
[9:06:32] <djblue_shift> the reason behind it is amazing too
[9:06:32] <jumpyhugs> ridin around like it's a clown bicycle
[9:06:39] <%Kevlar_Caviar> yeah you cannot use the horse this far away
[9:06:39] <HeroToxiko> LUL he finger severed so quick
[9:06:39] <rudiciuscaesar> so wait, he's cursed or whatever, but why the horse, that horse is a bro to stick with his man
[9:06:41] <@QueequegTheater> @Kaito_Cam No, he bails
[9:06:43] <KingKZ> I don't even understand how to fight this.
[9:06:45] <+LandOfTheWay> patches takes one look at radahn and is like "oh fuck all that noise"
[9:06:46] <RubberFistFight> @plaguedoctor_vi honestly so does Radahn, a bit
[9:06:47] <%Valdorick> Yeah, its a railgun and arrows track in this game.
[9:06:47] <%Bluwizard21> horse that carried the god that stole the stars is pretty damn nuts
[9:06:51] <FeralFozzie> Yomato gun online
[9:06:57] <RubberFistFight> @Kaito_Cam No he literally peaces out 5 seconds after spawning in
[9:07:05] <RubberFistFight> everyone else says [...died]
[9:07:07] <Kaito_Cam> I had to activate a great rune and eat anti magic stuff to survive this asshole.
[9:07:10] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt the rubble actually blocks his sniper shots
[9:07:10] <+Ingenk> Guy got strong just so he wouldn’t have to give up his horse
[9:07:13] <+tussletoes> does patches always leave? lmao
[9:07:15] <RubberFistFight> patches specifically says [...returned to his world]
[9:07:16] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> The swords block the arrows btw
[9:07:21] <HeroToxiko> patches can just go to another franchise when shit gets heavy
[9:07:22] <%Felhad> Always
[9:07:29] <+Ingenk> Patches always leaves
[9:07:32] <+LandOfTheWay> @tussletoes yep, he always bails after a few seconds
[9:07:34] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt would you like me to break down the mechanics of this puzzle boss? or do you want to do it yourself
[9:07:37] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> He got so big he learned gravity magic so he could still ride it
[9:07:39] <+nicversus> Man this is epic
[9:07:39] <%discoinfierno> This is a kill six billion demons fight
[9:07:41] <rudiciuscaesar> Pat that was good fucking damage you all did
[9:07:41] <%Felhad> Radahn is a fuckin shit
[9:07:43] <@Spydurman> you should get some sleep man
[9:07:45] <%Caped_Eggy> Don't get touch
[9:07:45] <+tussletoes> patches fucked off back to bloodborne
[9:07:47] <sirrice77> Man you got crazy damage
[9:07:51] <%epide> lol this seems like it should be in zelda
[9:07:52] <Kaito_Cam> Youch
[9:07:52] <%Felhad> Its a gimmick, not a puzzle
[9:07:52] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> No its not
[9:07:53] <%RealThiele> fight him fresh
[9:07:54] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> this is a bad boss
[9:07:55] <%boggsz12> you've got the right idea though with the rot
[9:07:56] <Paperware> He just hits really hard
[9:07:56] <+Based_Moose> Why he so big but horse so small?
[9:07:56] <%Bluwizard21> its a puzzle boss my friend
[9:07:56] <+eanscrale> That horse must have more strength than Radahn
[9:07:56] <LuminusVows> It's more like a raid boss
[9:07:57] <%YakumoYomi> Bow down, overdweller!
[9:07:59] <RubberFistFight> It's not a puzzle boss, it's a Raid boss
[9:07:59] <+sambws> Yeah you're dealing rly good damage
[9:07:59] <+Ravenian96> the puzzle is get good
[9:08:00] <ohno58> 100 percent gimmick boss
[9:08:01] <%tetraes> @PatStaresAt  Honestly just 1v1 him in melee is the easiest way
[9:08:04] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> isn't that worse
[9:08:07] <FeralFozzie> the puzzle is how to not die immediately
[9:08:08] <%dcentii> Radahn isn't a puzzle you just summon and dodge attacks just get gud
[9:08:09] <milkandcreamer> Rey without the summons once in a while, his ai is much more straightforward that way
[9:08:14] <urkleturtle> yeah, everything he does up close one-shots
[9:08:15] <peachy996> ROT Him Up!
[9:08:16] <KasiCrafter> I mean. The Physic gives you one free hit
[9:08:18] <%HairballCT> HairballCT subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 10 month streak! did you get the elden ring yet pat
[9:08:18] <@QueequegTheater> This is a "respec to have more health" boss
[9:08:20] <Happydisaster> Get all of the Allies puzzle boss
[9:08:21] <KatabolicRage> you can lock onto him from REALLY far away you know
[9:08:27] <rudiciuscaesar> woah, was that Kung Lao pat summoned?
[9:08:28] <Sunstalker> Patches isn't even putting down his sign again LuL
[9:08:30] <%coffeeabomination> coffeeabomination subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months! Wow I just started the Elden ring archive today so coming into what looks like the final battle is pretty trippy
[9:08:31] <djblue_shift> @Based_Moose there'
[9:08:31] <+eanscrale> His remembrance is nutty to say the least
[9:08:38] <Kaito_Cam> I see a bunch of people having trouble with this dude asking for help
[9:08:45] <%boggsz12> he is actually kind of a gimmick fight, but you haven't seen how yet and it's very easy to miss
[9:08:47] <%Felhad> @coffeeabomination lol, not even close
[9:08:47] <KatabolicRage> I'm serious, you can lock onto him from all the way back at the entrance of this arena
[9:08:49] <Kaito_Cam> but imo asking for help makes this fight harder kuz you have no horse.
[9:08:49] <%epide> LOL PAT YULL LOVE HIS WEPON
[9:08:51] <deviljhojho_> all the warriosr
[9:08:51] <djblue_shift> @Based_Moose there's an excellent reason*
[9:09:08] <Kaito_Cam> oh anyone know how to get his helmet?
[9:09:09] <penitentpendant> Driftin' on that horse
[9:09:12] <%Bluwizard21> @QueequegTheater nah you can beat it at any health as long as you do the puzzle routine
[9:09:13] <+sambws> I'm trying to gauge whether the coolness is enough for me to forgive the weird design choices here
[9:09:15] <%YakumoYomi> The spectacle is certainly impressive. The fight itself looks shitty.
[9:09:16] <urkleturtle> the spectacle is amazing, the actual fight is awful
[9:09:20] <rudiciuscaesar> oh wait
[9:09:22] <deviljhojho_> that rot tears him apart tho
[9:09:23] <%Nekros4442> theres another summon sign near the top of one of the hills he starts at
[9:09:23] <peachy996> Patches left
[9:09:24] <rudiciuscaesar> the boss has no feet?
[9:09:26] <%dcentii> the scarlet rot dragon just has much too long of an animation
[9:09:27] <TheHotStuven> Patches always leaves, not even worth the salt LUL
[9:09:29] <peachy996> And he keeps leving
[9:09:30] <@QueequegTheater> @Bluwizard21 That's not what puzzle means
[9:09:30] <rudiciuscaesar> he's an amputee it looked like
[9:09:30] <digaogrunge> DRINK YOUR JUICE
[9:09:31] <Maids4lyfe> how is that man riding a horse?
[9:09:31] <%coffeeabomination> @Felhad For real? that's insane, but I also believe it
[9:09:32] <CheezeWolf> @penitentpendant LUL maiyadSteer
[9:09:32] <%FunkyStreams> @PatStaresAt  letting him go through his moveset, first may help.
[9:09:32] <+nicversus> big man on tiny horse
[9:09:33] <Omenaire_> so he doesnt have feet and needs the horse?
[9:09:34] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Maybe you need to do this one fresh
[9:09:35] <ImTrin> the horse is the final boss Kappa
[9:09:36] <thesaverofhumens> standing still seems like a death sentence
[9:09:39] <%MaybeFalco> using a shield is your best bet here
[9:09:40] <sirrice77> @Kaito_Cam Pats helmet?
[9:09:46] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I love that Patches always runs away
[9:09:47] <KatabolicRage> I think something that roots you in place for tha tlong is kinda dangerous
[9:09:50] <%RealThiele> patches is the real big brain play of peace out
[9:09:51] <ReverendGodshyne> gottem
[9:09:51] <%Bluwizard21> @QueequegTheater illl pm u
[9:09:55] <Kaito_Cam> if you're having trouble maybe in the next session you could use a rune arc
[9:09:55] <$Mekhet09> Can you summon a pet?
[9:09:56] <%Nekros4442> I had to do this mounted
[9:09:57] <%Felhad> His boss arena is larger than almost every individual area in the Souls series
[9:10:01] <%epide> ive found that just beefing up phs dam and atk his rear worked best
[9:10:06] <peachy996> I imagine Patches takes one look and simply says "Nah" and peaces out
[9:10:10] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I could go for a shower. it'll help me sleep lol
[9:10:11] <Kaito_Cam> @sirrice77 no i have blaidds I want radahn helmet.
[9:10:12] <Zourath> I've heard that this fight is a viable invade location.
[9:10:12] <KasiCrafter> I think if he has his Physic shield up, I think Pat can get REAL far
[9:10:20] <rudiciuscaesar> Maybe all Pat needs is a food break lol. I always played better full
[9:10:26] <%whyskeywolfe> How many attempts we at?
[9:10:27] <deviljhojho_> well
[9:10:28] <%Felhad> lol
[9:10:29] <ReverendGodshyne> jesus
[9:10:29] <Vermillion129> OW
[9:10:29] <Sunstalker> I wish they had summon signs for every starter class except the one you started at. Like a big gathering of the player tarnished
[9:10:31] <ImTrin> more arrows
[9:10:33] <+nicversus> jesus lol
[9:10:36] <Maids4lyfe> good lord
[9:10:38] <%Felhad> Pat needs a sleep break, not food
[9:10:38] <+tussletoes> if you can come back here after the fight this would be a prime juicy PVP arena
[9:10:42] <sirrice77> @Kaito_Cam oh after beating radahn talk to the lady next to the two fingers and hit purchase
[9:10:43] <KingKZ> Is this even possible?
[9:10:44] <+Ravenian96> like 7 or 8 attempts
[9:10:46] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> HE SHOT ONE TIME AND MADE 100000000 ARROWS
[9:10:46] <%RealThiele> ARROW'ED
[9:10:46] <peachy996> You have officially seen the boss
[9:11:00] <rudiciuscaesar> Man, imagine when Paige gets to this....
[9:11:01] <%Monkeyweed21> Is this fight a fuckin reverse musou?
[9:11:01] <%Felhad> @tussletoes you can
[9:11:04] <+sambws> The whole renna questline for me is blocked until I beat this boss lol
[9:11:09] <+tussletoes> ooh
[9:11:10] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @PatStaresAt Remember when you said you were just gonna SEE Radahn?
[9:11:12] <peachy996> This is a DLC boss snuck into the main game
[9:11:13] <+polothegreatest> is he bobby or a dothraki?
[9:11:14] <%coffeeabomination> !uptime
[9:11:14] <@Moobot> @coffeeabomination I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 9h 11m.
[9:11:15] <CheezeWolf> LUL
[9:11:15] <FeralFozzie> so is this like the ruby weapon of this game or do you have to beat him for the story?
[9:11:17] <%whyskeywolfe> @TurtlesAndTentacles He's like the Jesus of war
[9:11:18] <%Nekros4442> @kingkz yes, he'll get it down eventually
[9:11:20] <blue8moon> no you're on mars
[9:11:22] <%topendbuzza> LUL
[9:11:25] <+mechslayer71> how many attempts in are we guys?
[9:11:26] <penitentpendant> @tussletoes I would totally take a free for all PVP for that zone.
[9:11:27] <%discoinfierno> I mean it's some asura's wrath shit
[9:11:27] <+sambws> @FeralFozzie Story boss
[9:11:29] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> this ridiculous. I have no clue if I can even dream of attempting this
[9:11:29] <rudiciuscaesar> @Monkeyweed21 dude yeah, it's like Souls's version of Lu Bu lol
[9:11:30] <+eanscrale> Nah it's just LA, the forest fires got outta hand
[9:11:30] <%MaybeFalco> the moon got transported from FFXIV to Elden Ring
[9:11:33] <plaguedoctor_vi> i mean this was going to be just a look
[9:11:37] <sirrice77> @FeralFozzie not for the story unless you want a certain 2 endings
[9:11:38] <%Felhad> Mandatory boss
[9:11:38] <%whyskeywolfe> Blaidd is over to the left
[9:11:38] <%RealThiele> get your ass to rot mars

[9:11:56] <ImTrin> the trick is be like patches and run
[9:12:17] <NewWillinium> Bless that tiny horse
[9:12:21] <peachy996> How long till patches leaves this time
[9:12:23] <rudiciuscaesar> just getting the boss to draw his sabers is a nightmare
[9:12:23] <+mechslayer71> yeah, pats vigor is gonna hold him back just like it did me
[9:12:28] <+tussletoes> alexander! i can't take this!
[9:12:29] <$Jaxnos> you honestly can just outhorse the volley and arrow rain, as long as you do the little dash at an even pace
[9:12:32] <peachy996> Not long lol
[9:12:33] <RubberFistFight> PATCHES BIG COWARD ENERGY
[9:12:35] <+ScrapKingKeita> ALEX NOOOO
[9:12:36] <rudiciuscaesar> Trusty Patchesss
[9:12:39] <Kaito_Cam> I susually summon everyone I can  and hang back until they get close where he start pulling out melee attack
[9:12:39] <%whyskeywolfe> Patches peaceing out immediately is the best
[9:12:40] <djblue_shift> LUL LUL LUL
[9:12:41] <+mechslayer71> how many tries is he on?
[9:12:42] <%Caped_Eggy> Patches like Nope I'm out
[9:12:54] <+dougtert> having 40 vig for this fight is essential
[9:12:54] <%RealThiele> jar opened
[9:12:54] <+sambws> The fact that he can get rotted is stupid lol
[9:12:59] <Vermillion129> now get on horse and run LUL
[9:12:59] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Everyone's dead, Jim.
[9:13:00] <luciluxlu0> you can resummon through npcs as well

[9:14:39] <Sigma_190_Beta> DUDE!
[9:14:39] <RubberFistFight> FUCKING DESTROYED
[9:14:39] <sirrice77> Dude so close
[9:14:39] <+wizard_of_diamonds> DANB
[9:14:40] <Kaito_Cam> Those meteors will one shot.
[9:14:40] <fortheboyzs> WHAT
[9:14:41] <+mechslayer71> yep, those one shot at your vigor
[9:14:41] <AnnoyedApricot> close
[9:14:42] <thesaverofhumens> goddamn he almost did it
[9:14:43] <FeralFozzie> damn. close
[9:14:43] <RubberFistFight> those are a guaranteed one-hit
[9:14:43] <%SuckerPunchSyd> NOOOOO
[9:14:43] <kingra> HOLY SHIT THAT WAS SO GOOD
[9:14:44] <%whyskeywolfe> Welp time to give up
[9:14:45] <+twenty112> BIG winnable
[9:14:47] <heartlesshealer> right at the end
[9:14:47] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> PAT ALMOST DID THIS.
[9:14:48] <%boggsz12> he is VERY weak to rot
[9:14:48] <%RealThiele> so close
[9:14:48] <RubberFistFight> they WILL kill you
[9:14:48] <%Nekros4442> yeah those meteors are a one shot
[9:14:49] <+Ravenian96> addicted to the hype
[9:14:49] <%Caped_Eggy> Hate that attack
[9:14:51] <graemecrackers2> doubled cheeked down
[9:14:52] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> He's not that bad
[9:14:52] <deviljhojho_> At least its not too bad with the rot
[9:14:52] <%MaybeFalco> those rock things WILL one shot you, he'll throw one set of two at a time, should be two dodges
[9:14:52] <NiSoKr> The meteors wait till the worst moment
[9:14:53] <+dougtert> that was incredibly close
[9:14:53] <rudiciuscaesar> that's totally doable,
[9:14:55] <%coffeeabomination> That was a great run tho
[9:14:55] <%Nekros4442> Gotta just go in
[9:14:56] <heartlesshealer> his summon rocks got ya
[9:14:57] <+ScrapKingKeita> Renalla drops a moon on you, he throws a comet
[9:14:57] <urkleturtle> those meteors are complete fucking bullshit
[9:14:57] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, Pat's got this
[9:14:58] <+wizard_of_diamonds> How the hell can you sleep after this
[9:14:58] <muerphy> Dweep
[9:14:59] <graemecrackers2> his tiny horse is so cute
[9:14:59] <plaguedoctor_vi> you need to use the dunes to dodge the meteors
[9:15:00] <%JoshManVGH> I don't get the gimmick
[9:15:00] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat is the greatest
[9:15:01] <+nicversus> DJ Caelid
[9:15:01] <peachy996> 2:45 Stream Time
[9:15:02] <Kaito_Cam> That's the shit that killed me a bunch
[9:15:04] <TheSphereHunter> you do
[9:15:05] <+mechslayer71> how many tries @chat
[9:15:06] <%RealThiele> just go till 3 am LUL
[9:15:06] <%whyskeywolfe> Did Bluwizard make another bet?
[9:15:10] <FeralFozzie> you can't go to bed, your so close
[9:15:10] <lazylazzer> Fucc this fight. I got stuck in mid air twice on it.
[9:15:12] <Vermillion129> @ytwitchmeng wouldnt mind if they collab with 14 and we get him as a raid
[9:15:12] <%MaybeFalco> its cause of the rot, lets be honest
[9:15:13] <KasiCrafter> Can you not use the Physic you used for the bridge dragon?
[9:15:13] <TheHotStuven> Doing it 1v1 is the real challenge
[9:15:16] <peachy996> 10 hr here we gooo
[9:15:16] <%FunkyStreams> its fiiiine
[9:15:17] <it_came_from_outer_space> the gimmick is fight him in a small army
[9:15:17] <%boggsz12> it's really not, people just miss how you're supposed to do it and get pissed
[9:15:17] <Brapula_> I just lamed this out with lightning spear lol
[9:15:18] <%Monkeyweed21> Yea Pat accidentally stumbled into radahns big weakness i.e. scarlet rot
[9:15:19] <%dcentii> Radahn isn't bad I don't know why people have such an issue with him
[9:15:19] <it_came_from_outer_space> which is rad
[9:15:22] <%Felhad> @mechslayer71 like 5 so far
[9:15:24] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I can't sleep until you win now
[9:15:25] <penitentpendant> I always like the skybox change for a form shift
[9:15:25] <deviljhojho_> int builds on suicide watch
[9:15:26] <+mechslayer71> I should've used magic more tbh, and the summons, and the horse. I was being stubborn for a bit
[9:15:26] <sirrice77> I feel like people didnt pump vigor enough when they got here
[9:15:28] <thesaverofhumens> pat is doing so well because he uses everything the game gives him
[9:15:29] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I really don't get why people complain so much about this fight
[9:15:30] <%SuckerPunchSyd> LUL
[9:15:33] <%Pookiedaexzile> The Smug is creeping in
[9:15:35] <rudiciuscaesar> this is actually like the worst part, that arrow is super fast, like, gives me anxiety watching it
[9:15:37] <+tussletoes> is he actually just conveniently weak to scarlet rot? cause that explains the dmg
[9:15:41] <%tetraes> i think this fight is harder for casters than melee tbh
[9:15:42] <+polothegreatest> plagueBed woolieGASM
[9:15:49] <%MaybeFalco> if you're pure melee, this fight SUCKS
[9:15:49] <+mechslayer71> @felhad gotcha
[9:15:49] <%FunkyStreams> amazing
[9:15:56] <sirrice77> @tussletoes idk about weak but rot does work yeah
[9:15:56] <+LandOfTheWay> i do like that it always lets you summon alexander and blaidd for their quests. it's good QOL
[9:16:00] <%boggsz12> @sirrice77 you're right and pat's vigor is even a tad bit low for it too
[9:16:01] <%RealThiele> 1v1 with regualr souls vigor this fight is likely pain\
[9:16:07] <thesaverofhumens> @tetraes pat hasnt used melee at all for this so far
[9:16:09] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> @dcentii cause he's overtuned as fuck, the damage, the range, the speed, he's too good
[9:16:09] <%whyskeywolfe> Can you actually inflict Scarlet Rot on Radahn?
[9:16:13] <+mechslayer71> @maybefalco yeah it was a bit rough trying to pure melee him
[9:16:16] <peachy996> @tussletoes well he did get jacked up by Scarlet Rot the first time might as well work some more
[9:16:17] <%Felhad> @thesaverofhumens Pat is doing so well because he's consistently been using Radahn's major weakness psaWhat
[9:16:18] <Explodincatz> pure melee is dead
[9:16:18] <casualbaloth> yes
[9:16:21] <marvel877> Its like trying to run up the the 16th Colossus or something.
[9:16:25] <sirrice77> @sirrice77 Well he's surviving stuff that one shot me at the time so its good enough
[9:16:28] <djblue_shift> can he actually be affected by rot?
[9:16:28] <+tussletoes> it won't proc afaik but does big damage
[9:16:32] <%boggsz12> @tussletoes it's thematic, the rot is why he's fucked up in the first place so he's weak to it
[9:16:42] <%murdocismyhero> Thats one badass mofo
[9:16:43] <HeroToxiko> So, who cut rads legs off
[9:16:44] <%Felhad> @djblue_shift it ruins him
[9:16:44] <%Caped_Eggy> Just lame it out pat
[9:16:46] <+5Two> Something tell me this is just stage 1 and he's just killing the horse.
[9:16:47] <+tussletoes> oh yeah that makes sense lol.
[9:16:53] <+mechslayer71> it's pretty dumb that scarlet rot does damage, considering he already has it and is dealing with it all the time
[9:16:54] <+snakebite_skuggs> SWEET HOME THEROLINA
[9:16:59] <%dcentii> also this is a fight where you can literally just infinitely summon and not even hit the boss
[9:17:03] <marvel877> Is that thing supposed to be Demise from Skyward Sword?
[9:17:06] <+tussletoes> we have one (1) maiden. finally
[9:17:06] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, this feels very King of the Storms or whatever
[9:17:07] <%RealThiele> physick time
[9:17:08] <+polothegreatest> Xtekken that boss
[9:17:10] <%Felhad> His legs are fingers @herotoxiko
[9:17:18] <HeroToxiko> and is that the godrick spell
[9:17:20] <@Spydurman> I honestly thought the dude would be immune to rot damage
[9:17:25] <%boggsz12> get your summons back
[9:17:25] <Carlioo> this fight looks nuts
[9:17:28] <HeroToxiko> @Felhad ah, too much spice
[9:17:29] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> HE BROUGHT THE STARS BACK
[9:17:30] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I came at you like a wreeeecking baaaaall
[9:17:31] <djblue_shift> @Felhad figured he'd have resistance due to waht happened to him but i guess not
[9:17:34] <+imthinkingdarbys> this reminds me of asura's wrath
[9:17:35] <+tussletoes> lol @ the player messages trying to throw you off
[9:17:37] <Carlioo> "summoned patches" LUL
[9:17:38] <thesaverofhumens> no :)
[9:17:41] <+Shinted24> The magic beam attack makes this fight a joke you can literally skip the whole fight.

[9:17:46] <%greasypete00> patches literally just leaves LUL

[9:23:23] <rudiciuscaesar> is Patches around?
[9:23:24] <deviljhojho_> maybe radhan wont be so bad
[9:23:26] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt his armor is choice but is super heavy
[9:23:31] <pi_in_the_sci> You never turned on the unborn rune?
[9:23:36] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Excellent Showing Pat. Excellent show
[9:23:38] <deviljhojho_> you should get the horse
[9:23:44] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You can also activate his rune too
[9:23:45] <haisho> I thought we were just gonna look at Radahn
[9:23:45] <FourLeafLover> abandon life, go in jar
[9:23:53] <%Valdorick> Unborn Rune is ALWAYS activate
[9:23:54] <+Tredecian> unborn is on by default i think
[9:23:55] <Sunstalker> Divine tower, every time
[9:23:59] <$ArcanumArcanum> @pi_in_the_sci unborn rune is just one by default
[9:23:59] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @pi_in_the_sci you can't, it's on by default
[9:24:00] <%Valdorick> the tower in Lunaria is for something else
[9:24:01] <%MaybeFalco> you don't it on afaik, its just the respec
[9:24:02] <pi_in_the_sci> the description on it should tell you where to go
[9:24:02] <+Ravenian96> It's not a great rune you can "turn on"
[9:24:03] <Kaito_Cam> rune arc
[9:24:03] <%Kevlar_Caviar> rennala is an optional boss
[9:24:05] <TheBlankAce> You can't turn that one on its just the ability to respec
[9:24:05] <ohno58> Need to climb divine tower in the region
[9:24:06] <Fill783> The unborn rune is just for doing rebirth
[9:24:07] <luciluxlu0> it's already on. it's all about respec
[9:24:08] <peachy996> We looked at him die
[9:24:08] <+ArtemisCroc> unborn rune just lets you respec
[9:24:08] <$Mekhet09> Rennala doesn't need it.
[9:24:09] <+Gregmeyer> yes
[9:24:10] <Vermillion129> unborn rune is just respec no?
[9:24:12] <%KnifeyMcEdge> rune arc
[9:24:13] <%Valdorick> Now you can go back to the Cealid tower, and climb up
[9:24:14] <blue8moon> you've already reached it
[9:24:15] <%epide> not for that one
[9:24:22] <+imthinkingdarbys> that looks sick
[9:24:22] <%Bluwizard21> The liarna divine tower is a quest line for rinna
[9:24:25] <%dcentii> @PatStaresAt radahn rune goes to tower with the boss in the basement
[9:24:29] <plaguedoctor_vi> the divine tower you got this sword from it the one used to activate his rune
[9:24:31] <Lord_nathaniel> The Unborn rune is always on from when you get it
[9:24:36] <rudiciuscaesar> faith bow?
[9:24:39] <milkandcreamer> item lore
[9:24:41] <Vermillion129> dual colossal sword Jebaited
[9:24:43] <deviljhojho_> maybe im a lion
[9:24:50] <TheBlankAce> So you dupe the soul first to get the pair of swords
[9:24:56] <%Valdorick> Its INT Colossal Sword LUL
[9:25:07] <Kaito_Cam> i just want his helmet.
[9:25:13] <%MaybeFalco> strong but smart sword
[9:25:14] <%boggsz12> those radahn's spear items are scattered through the boss arena, you're meant to shoot them at him, he's weak to them
[9:25:14] <milkandcreamer> the sword already comes as a pair
[9:25:16] <%Bluwizard21> my next playthrough is going to be a archery only play through cause there is so much in this game that revolves around bowmanshuip
[9:25:18] <jerach_> @TheBlankAce you don't dupe it. You have two swords by default
[9:25:19] <+Ravenian96> INT STR builds super viable in this game
[9:25:21] <rudiciuscaesar> @deviljhojho_  I see that FFVIII reference
[9:25:23] <Sunstalker> TheBlankAce You can dupe after using it I heard. its just the one dupe is the limit
[9:25:25] <+Based_Moose> I feel "sword" is a very loose term for that one
[9:25:28] <%Monkeyweed21> why did Pat stop reading lore?
[9:25:37] <it_came_from_outer_space> could you upgrade the talisman?
[9:25:46] <Vermillion129> go to fort haig
[9:25:46] <plaguedoctor_vi> near the fort
[9:25:47] <%dcentii> Radahn became the strongest Gravity Mage in the world to be able to ride his boyhood horse
[9:25:50] <%MaybeFalco> you better get ready for this shit
[9:25:50] <deviljhojho_> @rudiciuscaesar my man
[9:25:54] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Start from the fort and head north
[9:25:55] <%tetraes> tryh for Haight
[9:25:56] <%Valdorick> I would suggest stopping here, and seeing Mistwood tomorrow
[9:25:56] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Near fort
[9:25:57] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Its impossible to miss
[9:26:02] <Therusher> Oh you'll see it lol
[9:26:02] <milkandcreamer> you'll see it. can't miss it
[9:26:03] <%Felhad> I love his hat so much but im playing Bleed and have a +8 Arcane hat shyyFine
[9:26:03] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt You cant miss it
[9:26:09] <+Ravenian96> You can't miss it xD
[9:26:15] <%MaybeFalco> WE NIER AUTOMATA-ING THIS SHIT
[9:26:16] <deviljhojho_> huh
[9:26:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh
[9:26:17] <%boggsz12> lmao
[9:26:18] <djblue_shift> you also just wanted to see radahn
[9:26:18] <+LandOfTheWay> LUL
[9:26:18] <CheezeWolf> you just wanted to see radahn too
[9:26:20] <@Spydurman> uhuh
[9:26:20] <penitentpendant> Yeah
[9:26:21] <+GilroyGoldBlood> lmfao
[9:26:22] <armadaofghosts> OH
[9:26:23] <Vermillion129> fair
[9:26:25] <deviljhojho_> imagine that
[9:26:28] <@Spydurman> just wanted to "see" Radahn
[9:26:30] <Manwad> oh
[9:26:32] <KasiCrafter> You also "saw" the general, and we saw how THAT worked out
[9:26:33] <%Felhad> Behold, hole
[9:26:37] <+GilroyGoldBlood> This explains why there was fucking nothing in the Mistwoods
[9:26:38] <+Shinted24> Have you gotten the giant pot talisman, gives you a huge increase to equip weight. @patstaresat
[9:26:43] <%RealThiele> shits gone
[9:26:48] <%MaybeFalco> its the WHOLE reason why there isn't a grace directly in the mistwood
[9:26:50] <Vermillion129> one more one more no more one more
[9:26:56] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I had wondered what that giant open area in Caelid
[9:26:58] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Amazing how it lands right near where you met bliade the first time
[9:26:59] <spinningchurro> I can’t believe this game is real.
[9:27:04] <+imthinkingdarbys> this game is so sick, hopefully it gets patched on pc soon so it doesn't chug every 5 minutes
[9:27:08] <%whyskeywolfe> Have you killed the rollerball in the Fringefolk Hero dungeon? It gives you a unique bow.
[9:27:25] <%boggsz12> @whyskeywolfe YOUJ CAN KILL THAT FUCK
[9:27:28] <TheBlankAce> Are you going to activate the great rune on stream or off stream?
[9:27:31] <AnnoyedApricot> pretty fast
[9:27:33] <+Based_Moose> stronk
[9:27:33] <+LandOfTheWay> bout that fast
[9:27:34] <thesaverofhumens> goddamn
[9:27:35] <djblue_shift> OK
[9:27:37] <%MaybeFalco> @whyskeywolfe the fucking what now?
[9:27:40] <FeralFozzie> big hurt
[9:27:40] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Just beat Radahn myself a few hours ago. Goddamn, what a fight. Think I'm about 55 hours into my playthrough
[9:27:41] <CheezeWolf> well damn
[9:27:41] <Vermillion129> pretty fast
[9:27:42] <haisho> OKAY
[9:27:42] <%Bluwizard21> Press L2 and its done
[9:27:44] <digaogrunge> ded
[9:27:44] <kingra> Significant
[9:27:45] <@QueequegTheater> monkaS
[9:27:46] <+Shinted24> I also use these giants as a weapon test lol
[9:27:47] <%RealThiele> well then
[9:27:48] <MidnightPacif1c> coxBam
[9:27:49] <kryptotheskald> Preety fast.
[9:27:50] <Ghufufin> seems good
[9:27:56] <%whyskeywolfe> @boggsz12 haha yep, you can blow it up
[9:28:06] <ImTrin> going to need new test targets soon lol
[9:28:10] <%boggsz12> @whyskeywolfe thank you
[9:28:12] <%beavnation> its time for bed dude
[9:28:25] <$ArcanumArcanum> what weapon is that?
[9:28:26] <%dcentii> Radahn the raid boss is such a cool fight its a shame so many people don't like it
[9:28:27] <rudiciuscaesar> those colossus who fell from the sky?
[9:28:30] <rudiciuscaesar> they'd make a good test
[9:28:31] <+zdesert> 5+ stone
[9:28:38] <penitentpendant> The super bear in the Caelid valley?
[9:28:41] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt At some point I really want to duel you with my build but you need to catch up about 10 levels and 5 weapon levels
[9:28:46] <jerach_> @dcentii I personally find the fight sick and really fun
[9:28:46] <%whyskeywolfe> Once you kill the halberd guy there's a row of bombs in the roof directly above the road. Just shoot em down.
[9:28:53] <+GilroyGoldBlood> @dcentii I loved everything about it honestly. It was super hype having all your allies there
[9:28:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> the giants on the bridge to limgrave tower?
[9:29:08] <%Valdorick> Wait, did he just guard counter YOU!?
[9:29:12] <%Valdorick> Enemies can do that!?
[9:29:16] <%Felhad> @dcentii I liked it the first 5 times, I did not like it the next 40
[9:29:22] <%RealThiele> yea shield knights will guard counter you
[9:29:30] <+GilroyGoldBlood> Wait, is this the Onyx blade from Dark Souls 3 ashes of ariandel?
[9:29:35] <penitentpendant> @Valdorick Yup! So you can't spam 'guard break' on shield users
[9:29:40] <+Gregmeyer> it's the second best greatsword in the game imo
[9:29:44] <CheezeWolf> I tell you hwat
[9:29:44] <%crot454> val learn game
[9:29:46] <TheHotStuven> Pot fight!
[9:29:47] <%Bluwizard21> @Valdorick Yes the greatshield enemies specificalyl aim for guard counters
[9:29:48] <RubberFistFight> @dcentii the boss is cool, it's just completely un-fun to fight

[9:32:29] <thesaverofhumens> Kappa
[9:32:38] <%RealThiele> LUL
[9:32:43] <%MaybeFalco> yeah that was like 4-5 hours ago lmao
[9:32:47] <penitentpendant> @Bluwizard21 And you got him his new sword too
[9:32:47] <%Monkeyweed21> Every single build appears to have at least a few cool things that are also strong, even my quality build gets cool shit like the sword of n&f
[9:33:15] <RubberFistFight> it'll keep longer than that if refrigerated
[9:33:16] <%Valdorick> @Bluwizard21 You got Pat to get a sweet sword, and you paid 200 dollar for it. Mad respect.
[9:33:17] <Vermillion129> wut
[9:33:26] <HeroToxiko> you get multiple bags
[9:33:29] <%MaybeFalco> i found that out by accident today as well
[9:33:29] <+twenty112> Hours??? It keeps for like a week
[9:33:33] <RubberFistFight> it takes a couple days for bacterial activity to really kick off in pasteurised milk.
[9:33:35] <%MaybeFalco> no idea it was related to her
[9:33:40] <%Monkeyweed21> WHO CONSUMES FIVE GLASSES OF MILK IN AN HOUR
[9:33:44] <%Bluwizard21> This is the best game of a decade
[9:33:49] <RubberFistFight> and if you're worried about it you can probably just fold it over and put a clothes peg on it
[9:33:52] <+ArtemisCroc> the game keeps begging me to get an ending but I haven't seen like 5 zones that I know exist
[9:34:00] <CheezeWolf> is a liter the biggest bag size?
[9:34:01] <penitentpendant> @Monkeyweed21 Anyone spamming Peanut Butter sandwiches
[9:34:01] <%MaybeFalco> @Monkeyweed21 milkmen

[9:34:33] <%Pookiedaexzile> 33 percent
[9:34:35] <%Valdorick> maybe
[9:34:36] <Vermillion129> I dont think you are either
[9:34:37] <+Ravenian96> You are not halfway
[9:34:39] <blue8moon> so many more zones
[9:34:41] <penitentpendant> Not until the map is fully unlocked, at least
[9:34:41] <+ArtemisCroc> I'm like 70 hours in and I haven't done ANYTHING
[9:34:47] <+thickshield> every time... i see the map... its bigger... does this game end? it may be forever
