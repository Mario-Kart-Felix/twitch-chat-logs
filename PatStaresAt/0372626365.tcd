[0:04:04] <%ElenaManetta> AND I WAS RIGHT. Ernesto did nothing wrong
[0:04:06] <%ElenaManetta> Ernesto is a hero
[0:04:14] <%Plague_Nurse> Currently doing a speedrun, and made it to the Umbrella Lab at 1:18:13. I need some practice
[0:04:19] <Run44forrest> whos ernesto de la cruz

[0:04:43] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> oh that guy
[0:04:46] <%The_Esquana> Just in time to distract me from my homeowrk
[0:04:48] <%ElenaManetta> Ernesto is great everyone is wrong
[0:04:49] <gustavozxd> i was watching a video where 2 mr x showed up at the same time LUL
[0:04:51] <%Plague_Nurse> BibleThump
[0:04:58] <%tuesti> @The_Esquana same!
[0:04:59] <%RNGbob> for yall who dont know KH3 is extra dumb
[0:05:00] <Bobbledygook> Elmo can climb into Ernesto's ribcage and pilot him like a mecha, it's sick
[0:05:02] <foreverN2dust> @gustavozxd how?
[0:05:10] <+MonsieurHedge> question: do yall have stream-watchin games? i like to play survival-y shit or grind in warframe
[0:05:12] <derekwst3> @ElenaManetta I still think Sora would be a better guy
[0:05:14] <%RNGbob> but they added style switching
[0:05:16] <Run44forrest> kh 3 spoiler thanos show up
[0:05:28] <gustavozxd> @foreverN2dust a bug, dude was speedruning and it just happened
[0:05:41] <%Luna_Ashford> Fuck KH3, that series is so garbage
[0:05:54] <+Piejumper5814> I love kh3!
[0:06:00] <gustavozxd> i still consider kh2 an amazing action game but other than that LUL
[0:06:00] <reonome> people like garbage
[0:06:00] <%tuesti> pls no kh3 spoilers
[0:06:09] <+KyroDragon> Tyrant scares the hell out of me.
[0:06:19] <reonome> spoilers goofy is sora
[0:06:19] <+HoloToast> people like garbage, that's why we're here sbfpPat
[0:06:22] <%Codemaster7777> ON the back of the electrical parts in RE2make the part code is Aegis Conductor
[0:06:23] <%kabermano> Spoilers in general are a dick move when the thing came out a literal day ago
[0:06:26] <+heroicspiritavenger> Heterosexuality won in KH3, no LGBT couples
[0:06:27] <SiegeJay> I am conflicted if I should even buy a new video game or just save my money and wait for DMC5
[0:06:27] <+bigmak93> I gave up on Kingdom Hearts. A super novel concept with the heavy burden of being written for a JRPG crowd.
[0:06:28] <%Ya_boi_wally > patrique
[0:06:29] <%Codemaster7777> Aegis Reflector
[0:06:30] <pillowwasp> Johnny depp stoke the infinity stones
[0:06:31] <dragoon001914> Should I keep playing Mass Effect or watch the stream
[0:06:32] <reddeadwine1277> Speaking of garbage..now I want taco bell
[0:06:33] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> the other day, some dude was going off about KH3 being awesome, and I just looked at him and said "all I know bout kingdom hearts is "Aqua got Norted," whatever that means." he immediately looked bummed out and walked off to class.
[0:06:34] <%RaikenTB> it's already outselling RE2 in Japan.
[0:06:42] <%kabermano> @heroicspiritavenger Well that's japan for ya
[0:06:48] <%CJett92> KH3 Spoiler - Woody is Sora's dad
[0:06:48] <%ElenaManetta> Heteros didn't JUST win in KH3. Sora now wants to bang every princess he sees!
[0:06:50] <%RNGbob> no spoilers, just confirming high levels of nonsense
[0:06:51] <%MisterRockett> Kingdom Hearts is the one Square Action game that has blended Action and RPG elements the best.
[0:06:58] <+heroicspiritavenger> @kabermano I for one think it's great
[0:07:09] <TheRageofAfrica> Its that time again, time for pat to nut in his pants for 7 hours straight
[0:07:10] <gustavozxd> @heroicspiritavenger and in the end no one's surprised
[0:07:10] <%FracturedImage> L A T E
[0:07:12] <%CJett92> Boom

[0:07:33] <+shawntk_> KH3 does many great things, including being Nomura's revenge for getting kicked off FF15
[0:07:34] <%ElenaManetta> Loving dumb things is why we watch Pat and Paige

[0:25:52] <asurite_warrior> I love how they don't break the skin when the zombies bite you and it doesnt kill you
[0:25:54] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @tigerfang86 it's kinda sad cause I wanted to play REmake2 but when KH3 dropped I put it down, gotta see the resolution after 13 years of waiting
[0:25:54] <%Taisuru> New music better

[0:26:28] <%Toynota10> @Das_Bass He'll probably S-Rank
[0:26:28] <gustavozxd> re2remake completely killed my kh3 hype and I never even cared that much about the original re2
[0:26:35] <%Taisuru> The old music just doesn't fit the new atmosphere of the remake
[0:26:39] <+SirBearic> its in the save room
[0:26:41] <kareemo_tk> hello fellow god gamer
[0:26:43] <majindusto> The new 'ambience" is not better than the old music
[0:26:48] <%connos_livereview> has he talked about how lame her outfit is without the black t yet chat ?
[0:26:48] <mr_ESB> No heals and no box runs sounds scary WutFace
[0:26:53] <$urban_hoof> I wish I knew more about Resident Evil... my girl dose, im more of a RPG person not puzzle shooters
[0:26:56] <+psithen> why do B have to do thing A already did?
[0:26:57] <%DirtyGaijin> No box run sounds insane
[0:27:03] <%LogothX> Excuse me sir
[0:27:07] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> It fits fine, to me. Just Mr X stomps with his old theme is out of place
[0:27:10] <gustavozxd> no heal is crazy because you can barely defend yourself in this game
[0:27:12] <reddeadwine1277> yup

[0:27:38] <BreakTheBarrier> the music just isn't the same without the CLACKCLACK CLACKCLACK of the footsteps
[0:27:43] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> @theenablerr supposedly, the ME2 plot of Haestrom's sun dying was gonna end with a reveal the the Reapers were killing races with Mass Effect capability because that's killing the stars with dark matter discharge (or something like that) to keep the whole galaxy from dying. I'd have rathered that or no reveal of why the reap at all. other than that, 8/10.
[0:27:43] <%commanderclaw> Get fucking used to it bitch
[0:27:44] <%Toynota10> @MaeMae94 Oh that's a game changer. Thanks!
[0:27:45] <%kabermano> @Idon__ Booooo
[0:27:47] <JDRK> I didn
[0:27:49] <Fuji_Apples> fanfiring revolver lol
[0:27:50] <$LocDogX86X> its good though Pat
[0:27:51] <Flyrant> it's not just about shooting, it's about reloading!
[0:27:52] <asurite_warrior> he wants dem legs
[0:27:52] <gustavozxd> @Toynota10 when you're on the map/inventory/files yes but when you press the start button you can see in the top corner that the time stops, cutscenes also don't count on the timer
[0:27:54] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat It can fan the hammer
[0:27:55] <%JGardner88> No box is surprisingly manageable as long as you know when you can complete puzzles and just leave gunpowder
[0:27:55] <%DirtyGaijin> Elliot didn't make the.....cut
[0:27:56] <Ion_LaserX> Claire holds it like a six shooter in an old western
[0:27:56] <JDRK> I didn't care for either B gun really
[0:27:58] <%FrostMass22> Silent Hill's 20th anniversary is tomorrow and not even Konami cares
[0:28:00] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @ElenaManetta Ethan would be a lanky version of Sebass from Evil Within
[0:28:03] <%ElenaManetta> If Pat were American, he would know EXACTLY how to feel about his gun.
[0:28:04] <%Toynota10> Cool
[0:28:05] <%LogothX> Do first aid sprays reduce your rank?
[0:28:05] <%supersugoisenpai1> Claire loves reloading during a battle

[0:28:20] <%DirtyGaijin> Claire has got nothing on Leon's Gantsa Stance
[0:28:22] <%ThatGuyfromMars> that revolver is so star spangled awesome tho
[0:28:25] <outis94> pew pew
[0:28:25] <Fuji_Apples> god the reloading on that thing though
[0:28:28] <beercules12> hold down the trigger
[0:28:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat is squishy boi
[0:28:33] <+jjgamez64> If you could reload more than 1 bullet it wouldnt be so hated
[0:28:34] <Run44forrest> twitch fucking up the music it sounds goofy
[0:28:36] <%JGardner88> @LogothX I believe so, you cant get a S+ if you use one
[0:28:37] <theangryguyofde> there are four beds and eight desks in RCPD LUL
[0:28:40] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> @theenablerr Well... except Kai Leng. Delet him.
[0:28:40] <that_owl_guy> That gun is good during a couple of boss fights, imo. Against the randos, just ignore it if you can
[0:28:41] <+jjgamez64> its a fun gun to use
[0:28:42] <Flyrant> is this hardcore or baby standard?
[0:28:46] <grayjammer> Kuum here

[0:30:39] <gustavozxd> there's an item that if you don't pick up, x doesn't show up where he's supposed to in the B scenario i think, im gonna try that out
[0:30:41] <%Typhaeon> Poor Marv
[0:30:42] <Idon__> marvin pls
[0:30:43] <RantingRavager> Marvin BibleThump
[0:30:43] <+suurising> how much later is claire ariving at the precinct that marvin is already dead?
[0:30:45] <%Bailey__gaming> Non stop something something Stainless steal
[0:30:46] <conflict1914> marvin no
[0:30:47] <circular7> rip Marvin bitterEnd
[0:30:47] <+scape_goat> Hx in the chat

[0:30:51] <%GohanEgret> MARVIN BibleThump
[0:30:52] <+CamTasticS> @wolf_hurricane jesus christ man
[0:30:53] <majindusto> Who?
[0:30:53] <%ThePuddingDead> marvin....
[0:30:56] <SentientHoodie> Strong, but the reload is terrible
[0:30:56] <%Secutus> F
[0:30:57] <Smart_ZaK1> Does Claire have a knife?
[0:30:58] <LiquidMathew> ZAPPING!
[0:30:58] <321Continue> MARVIN NO
[0:30:59] <$urban_hoof> @angriestpat , can you tell me story wise whats actually happening ?
[0:31:00] <%MagickBurritoh> Look at Pat killing all the minority undead saying "I don't like you guys being here"
[0:31:00] <%DirtyGaijin> Cop dad no
[0:31:01] <Idon__> Marvin, we talked about workplace sexual harassment...
[0:31:02] <%ThatGuyfromMars> rip marvin
[0:31:02] <321Continue> RANDY
[0:31:03] <+HoloToast> Leon comes in and is like "WTF Claire you ignorant slut, why did you kill Marvin???"
[0:31:06] <%ThePuddingDead> and very little recoil too
[0:31:07] <wolf_hurricane> @CamTasticS what, do you not?
[0:31:08] <gustavozxd> where can you find the matt walker zombie
[0:31:08] <Flyrant> I assume the zombies are "alive" and the people they once were are in a nightmarish state of existence
[0:31:09] <allanmiri> rip marvin
[0:31:10] <%SvenHolgersson> Just give him a apatBig hug!
[0:31:10] <TheEnablerr> @pleasenameyourcharacter actually I don't mind the reason of why the Reaper's cull happens. I think I peeved more at the Prothean "Redesign" out of nowhere after everyone thinks they look like those lanky statues on Ilos and then the explanation becomes "Oh every species under the Empire is Prothean. Please ignore everything else before clearly not designed as it is now" oh and SUDDENLY milistaristic.
[0:31:11] <%ElenaManetta> Small things pack a punch. Pat should know this by now.
[0:31:12] <Run44forrest> Marv2Stronk
[0:31:13] <%connos_livereview> just wait till the reload gets you killt
[0:31:13] <%DirtyGaijin> Stop resisting marv!

[0:31:29] <+CamTasticS> @wolf_hurricane no its a fucking computer game
[0:31:36] <Smart_ZaK1> WHOS line is it anyway?
[0:31:38] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @urban_hoof There's a game called Spleunky, I think, yeah. Claire is just nepotism made main character. She's Chris' sister. Chris from RE1
[0:31:39] <circular7> crazy talk
[0:31:40] <MaeMae94> Remember when paige thought the licker said "oh boy" LUL
[0:31:41] <phatballlz54> knife the licker!

[0:31:49] <Run44forrest> WHO'S STOMPING
[0:31:50] <majindusto> Boo
[0:31:52] <gustavozxd> A and B scenarios are more similiar than you think pat
[0:31:54] <Flyrant> she did
[0:31:55] <AlasterAngelo> "LEON PLEASE FUCK MY SISTER" - Chris
[0:31:58] <+HoloToast> Haunted House much?
[0:31:59] <%GohanEgret> @MaeMae94 legendary moment
[0:32:01] <%DirtyGaijin> Who's Zapping?
[0:32:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> The way shes holding the gun makes it seem like she can shoot the gun quick.
[0:32:04] <rumuloh> WHO'S WALKING
[0:32:04] <mr_ESB> Graah get scared lady
[0:32:06] <%konekoryugamine> Oh shit how long as he been streaming
[0:32:07] <Flyrant> the only thing they needed to add was her seeing boo
[0:32:09] <%konekoryugamine> Just got here
[0:32:09] <%ElenaManetta> All the prop placement and design in this game is great. The whole "barrel and crate" visual design argument completely thrown out here
[0:32:10] <+RioGascar> Fuck this hallway on A AND B HARDCORE
[0:32:13] <%konekoryugamine> !runtime
[0:32:14] <Flyrant> saying*
[0:32:16] <+sturner202> pat you didnt cut the chain
[0:32:16] <gustavozxd> they're even more similar
[0:32:19] <%fattness132> 2ND run is more of a remix mode, i like it honestly
[0:32:21] <%konekoryugamine> Er, wait, not, that's not it
[0:32:21] <Idon__> GIVE HIM HIS SNACKS
[0:32:22] <%GohanEgret> *mr x shows up* WHOS STALKING
[0:32:22] <+Tokanova> "LEON YOU KNOW SHE'S COOL JUST DATE HER ALREADY" - Chris

[0:32:23] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 32m 25s.
[0:32:23] <LiquidMathew> Is it true Zapping?
[0:32:25] <%Toynota10> You have defeated big chungus
[0:32:25] <Worldbrand> he just wants a snack
[0:32:26] <%Typhaeon> Fat zombies especially
[0:32:27] <exploitativity2> yo what is that grip
[0:32:29] <theTrapWizard> rip detonator
[0:32:29] <+valkuma> oh my od theres lickers in leon b
[0:32:29] <Flyrant> no zapping system
[0:32:31] <+psithen> i wonder what the randomized mode will be like
[0:32:31] <%MagickBurritoh> Revolver Claire strikes again
[0:32:34] <exploitativity2> is she fanning it?
[0:32:35] <%connos_livereview> its not true zapping
[0:32:35] <%konekoryugamine> YES
[0:32:39] <wolf_hurricane> @exploitativity2 yep
[0:32:39] <%InfamousShephard> not true zapping
[0:32:40] <+jjjkopf> what do they change? your route through the RPD?
[0:32:41] <AlasterAngelo> "LEON SHE'S 40 AND A CAT LADY PLEASE" - Chris
[0:32:41] <%DirtyGaijin> I like that the 2nd run give you some of the classic moments in the RPD
[0:32:44] <%konekoryugamine> Aw I thought the zombie was headless . . .
[0:32:44] <Fuji_Apples> how is it compared to the difference of A and B in the original re2 game?
[0:32:47] <gustavozxd> oh yeah they're different enough to just play all of them and still feel fresh
[0:32:48] <exploitativity2> she's reaaally quick on the fan
[0:32:49] <%fattness132> @AngriestPat there was a knife next to elliot in the wall
[0:32:52] <%Typhaeon> Not true zapping, more like jolting Kappa
[0:32:53] <exploitativity2> and also accurate
[0:32:57] <AlasterAngelo> "I WANT A NEPHEW LEON"
[0:32:58] <MaeMae94> 2nd could've been better, but I'd still take it over nothing
[0:32:59] <TheEnablerr> Fat zombie wants his vending machine chocolate. Oh Japan.
[0:33:03] <exploitativity2> like that's some ocelot shit
[0:33:03] <RantingRavager> "It's high noon."
[0:33:05] <Angry_Ev1L> there is a knife stuck in the wall
[0:33:05] <%konekoryugamine> DAMN I want her jacket!
[0:33:07] <ScreamingMeat> "It's so different from simply changing a clip!"
[0:33:08] <%DirtyGaijin> Fat evil never gets snacks
[0:33:10] <+Tokanova> what do you think chris and claire were like as kids
[0:33:10] <Flyrant> ADA WAIT!
[0:33:13] <%connos_livereview> @Fuji_Apples its pretty poor compared to original 4
[0:33:18] <exploitativity2> This reload time is exhilirating!
[0:33:18] <%lewdskeletor13> I just realized today that Claire has a letter from her friend in her inventory at the start of the game
[0:33:20] <unawakenedoozaru> Six bullets... More than enough to kill anything that moves - revolver ocelot
[0:33:23] <%konekoryugamine> Or here SHIRT or whatever that is! That's fucking awesome shirt jacket!
[0:33:23] <Idon__> never noticed that had a window
[0:33:25] <$SirG005E> !timeup
[0:33:28] <%konekoryugamine> Clothes shit!
[0:33:30] <%GohanEgret> Revolver Clairecelot
[0:33:31] <TheEnablerr> nice
[0:33:32] <%connos_livereview> its more like 1.8

[0:33:36] <allanmiri> pop
[0:33:37] <+boomstickery> he was tough as fuck
[0:33:41] <+Tokanova> he's gone 4 good
[0:33:41] <exploitativity2> "You twist your elbow to absorb the recoil."
[0:33:41] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> @theenablerr that was weird as a retcon, but i kinda liked it as a recontextualization. i guess i'm still conflicted on how i feel about that. but it does feel kinda cheap either way, even with how badass Javik is.
[0:33:41] <%Typhaeon> Pat loves to reload during a battle
[0:33:45] <%bearalin> Pop
[0:33:49] <%connos_livereview> or 1.7 than even 2 runs

[0:33:52] <theangryguyofde> when's the mod that adds crimson heads DarkMode
[0:33:53] <ScreamingMeat> 6 shot, more than enough to kill anything that's dead
[0:33:53] <gustavozxd> god this is the most satisfying headshot effect I've ever seen in a videogame
[0:33:53] <%Taisuru> I love to reload during a survival
[0:33:53] <lloyddboy> 0
[0:33:56] <%The_Esquana> Why do Chris and Claire talk to zombies like misbehaving children?
[0:33:56] <+LoneRollingStar> the password is password
[0:33:57] <+psithen> it's so much different than simply changing a clip
[0:33:58] <%MagickBurritoh> 1234

[0:34:03] <%Das_Bass> 1111

[0:34:09] <+Tokanova> nice job

[0:35:39] <%Toynota10> So if you unlock the dlc weapons, do you just start with them if you turn them on?

[0:36:03] <%lewdskeletor13> @angriestpat are you surprised that Marvin wasnâ€™t on Ghost Survivors?
[0:36:06] <Flyrant> knives in this game degrade faster than a plastic knife
[0:36:12] <+EVOriginal> atpTryAiming
[0:36:18] <Smart_ZaK1> Yeah put the wire cutters in there
[0:36:20] <Huitzil37> god using claire b's revolver was a nightmare for me
[0:36:22] <circular7> put the knife in the circuit box
[0:36:24] <%nezunskyfire> Imagine RE2 but they had crimson heads like in the RE1 remake
[0:36:24] <NumbusPlays> why does claire hold the pistol like that
[0:36:26] <%kabermano> Anybody here!? Stab stab
[0:36:26] <%DirtyGaijin> Im hoping for Marvin to be an extra DLC for GS
[0:36:28] <%connos_livereview> i actually thought the removal of ribbons was fine until i saw pat doing ridiculous save scumming now i think it kind of fucks the balance
[0:36:29] <$urban_hoof> @thatguyfrommars. perfect, all i wanted to know ... its cause i know jack shit about RE ... any and almost all of them
[0:36:30] <$SGrim> I mean, you COULD use bolt cutters as a fuse... It's just a terrible idea. rooKek
[0:36:31] <Huitzil37> fires so fucking fast, reloads so fucking slow
[0:36:33] <gustavozxd> Pat don't waste your knifes NotLikeThis
[0:36:36] <MasterKoosh> pat attempts to put his crank in a socket rated R
[0:36:40] <that_owl_guy> Tbf, Claire should be using the wire cutters as a bludgeon
[0:36:45] <%fattness132> DAT BOSS DPS
[0:36:47] <+HoloToast> bosses
[0:36:48] <%connos_livereview> kill lickers

[0:36:53] <%ThatGuyfromMars> rapid body shots
[0:36:53] <exploitativity2> IS THAT MARVIN
[0:36:53] <%FrostMass22> So ink ribbons are only in hardcore?
[0:36:55] <Idon__> So you can shoot Mr X faster
[0:36:56] <%DirtyGaijin> She wants to show off her skills
[0:36:56] <Tha_Mik> Rip claire's fingers
[0:36:59] <+MrWrann> Blows the zombies minds to
[0:37:00] <NumbusPlays> it's actually not cool at all
[0:37:01] <conflict1914> rip marvin
[0:37:01] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @urban_hoof I suck with usernames so I more or less went nuts with alliteration. I think Claire heard shit was going down in Raccoon City and wanted to see if Chris was ok. And then of course, we find out Chris wasn't even in the country
[0:37:03] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Idon__) (warning)
[0:37:03] <+MeatBomb> Fan the Marvin.
[0:37:03] <%DirtyGaijin> Marv no
[0:37:03] <%Taisuru> Pat, you have to fan the hammer into a zombie at some point
[0:37:04] <outis94> birkin?
[0:37:05] <gustavozxd> for waking zombies back up?
[0:37:05] <Flyrant> just wait til the final boss of clair, and fan away
[0:37:06] <%Corporate_Redeemer> CUZ RED DEAD
[0:37:08] <%sirmackslot> The greatest handgun ever made.
[0:37:09] <dekkitout> because it melts tanks since its rate of fire buff Kappa
[0:37:11] <+keitha313> she is a big fan of ocelot from mgs
[0:37:14] <+chaumiester> Because it's a revolver that needs to be cocked every shot.... Also because its cool
[0:37:18] <Idon__> Marv abuse
[0:37:19] <$ooblagis> The knife is BIG damage, because of a bug, and better spent murdering zombies than on defense stabs
[0:37:19] <+GameBeardHS> the amount of times ive accidentally shot 2 bullets at once with that gun is stupid. screw that gun
[0:37:19] <%MadMatt2099> Aw poor Marvin
[0:37:20] <%fattness132> @AngriestPat knives vs lickers is just crazy good, saves you some grenade ammo
[0:37:20] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat Why would you ever shoot a gun gangster style?
[0:37:20] <$SirG005E> flashbang fanthehammer do it coward
[0:37:21] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> is Claire trained in some way, or is she a Mary Sue of guns?
[0:37:22] <AlasterAngelo> isn't fanning the hammer awful for the gun
[0:37:25] <Mr_Strut> Marvin is very tough
[0:37:25] <allanmiri> I'm not a big fan of CLaire's six shooter. I agree with pat that would just hurt your ammo.
[0:37:26] <ScreamingMeat> Then again, why would you hold a gun sideways when you shoot, RECENTLY TRAINED OFFICER LEON!?
[0:37:27] <CrypticMochi> He how to use his knives ya baby
[0:37:28] <OwlLightningMage> @dekkitout I see what you did there LUL
[0:37:34] <%lewdskeletor13> dOnt WAstE tHe KnIFe
[0:37:34] <gustavozxd> knifes are amazing against the flower guys, shoot them once and knife away
[0:37:36] <%DirtyGaijin> Don't hurt cop dad
[0:37:43] <%ThatGuyfromMars> It's single action, so you have to pull back the hammer with each shot, double actions take care of that for you
[0:37:45] <%Laecerelius> Slicer her butt!
[0:37:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> butt stab
[0:37:48] <Run44forrest> shes big 2nd amendment american
[0:37:50] <TheEnablerr> @pleasenameyourcharacter had they started fleshing out the retcon in ME2 it would've been fine for me but it felt more like "Oh the collectors were Prothean so we should make them more Collector-y" even though you know, genetic engineering would've explained just fine how they changed so much. it was way too abrupt for my taste. Javik as a character and his own development is great though. I just hate suddenly retconning lore with no real reason
[0:37:53] <that_owl_guy> Rapid fire does cause the barrel to warp if you do it enough
[0:37:55] <Ran196> did you get all the racoon toys?
[0:37:56] <dekkitout> im just doing my duty as a citizen
[0:37:56] <%DirtyGaijin> Bye knife-chan

[0:52:35] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> STOP RESISTING
[0:52:38] <reddeadwine1277> Where jiggle?
[0:52:38] <Guardiansaiyan> @AngriestPat Right now you have more viwers than StreamFourStar playing Kingdom Hearts 3
[0:52:40] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> don't touch your nose
[0:52:42] <%lewdskeletor13> HE SHOT FIRST
[0:52:42] <%konekoryugamine> It's that one guy Glen from TWD
[0:52:42] <%GingaNZ> sweet as
[0:52:45] <%thekillerkalamari> intestine
[0:52:45] <%DirtyGaijin> Elliot is just a really big fan of Star Fox
[0:52:46] <GoldeNOVA> Can't you just RE4 it and shoot them in the leg then shoot them in the ground?
[0:52:51] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Leg Brains are in the Butt
[0:52:56] <%MagickBurritoh> OH GOD
[0:52:56] <%ThatGuyfromMars> The infinite weapons let me go at my own pace now, Remake2 is a different experience when you're not scrounging for ammo and shit
[0:52:56] <Firesparks> does claire keep the revolver the entire game?
[0:52:56] <%BioApple> How do you tell if zambambos are dead for good if they still have heads? I've never figured it out
[0:53:00] <majindusto> Stream's Dyin' Cloud
[0:53:04] <Run44forrest> Could you survive with only your upper body? No legs No Ass
[0:53:05] <%lewdskeletor13> You cant
[0:53:07] <%MagickBurritoh> those freeze frames are jarring
[0:53:07] <Smart_ZaK1> Just sprinkle some crack on him
[0:53:08] <+scape_goat> lag
[0:53:11] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> oof
[0:53:16] <deviantxghost1> I've beat this game 4 times and I might go for a 5th lol. this game rocks
[0:53:16] <%Demon_Shadow4> yea settle for second best!
[0:53:17] <%Laecerelius> I'm just going for A, says the man who restarted his run twice
[0:53:18] <that_owl_guy> You have to shoot or knife them.
[0:53:19] <reddeadwine1277> Open and shut case, Johnson
[0:53:20] <PineappleBison> BIG LAG
[0:53:21] <%Toynota10> I bet Paige could rock a sick cosplay of this Claire
[0:53:23] <$urban_hoof> @guardiansaiyan its the streamer not the content
[0:53:23] <brambobelurkin> @Smart_ZaK1 Well they are in a police station lol
[0:53:24] <legendz431> Hi
[0:53:26] <%DirtyGaijin> I think the shock alone would kill you
[0:53:26] <Flyrant> @BioApple you don't, unless you knife them to see if they react
[0:53:35] <%AirlineFood74> @lolslowking I love that their tougher. In cutscenes and some cinematics (see: RE1's live-action Opening) they tank all kinds of shit they don't in the OG games so I like that they're tankier because it brings them more in line with those cutscene bois
[0:53:35] <%connos_livereview> the infinite samurai edge is beyond boring to use
[0:53:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat is speed running off the screen
[0:53:36] <NeroCapone> big F's are happening

[0:54:58] <PineappleBison> Just buy Twitch dumbass.
[0:54:59] <majindusto> LAG
[0:55:00] <%king_wragles> ! TWITCH AT RISK!
[0:55:01] <ScreamingMeat> I wish instead of Infinite weapons we had Infinite Ammo Boxes so you can have infinite ammo for any weapon that uses the correct ammo. That way you can use any weapon you like with InfiniAmmo but still have to manage items a bit so you don't just equip everything at once unless you want to run back to the trunk all the time
[0:55:07] <%king_wragles> Seriously, the hell is going on?
[0:55:10] <%Laecerelius> Yeah Pat's stream is messing up but Spy's stream is just fine
[0:55:13] <ArtThouBored> Dont say that about Twitch
[0:55:13] <%Raxus_Secundus> Is this the Claire B scenario?

[0:55:16] <%thekillerkalamari> The only way to fix Fallout 76 is to uninstall it
[0:55:16] <DominoFrancisco> I love this classic outfit but i kinda wish it still had the black sleeves
[0:55:17] <%JJCheeker> You should go look at that computer screen Kappa
[0:55:20] <+Blackgaver> jeeez clair has a big booty....
[0:55:23] <VritraReiRei> RIP knife durability
[0:55:27] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I'd really like it if cappy let us switch main characters' weapons, like letting Claire use the VP70 or Leon using claire's revolver
[0:55:27] <%lewdskeletor13> Mr Twitch is having a bad day
[0:55:32] <%AirlineFood74> rip frames
