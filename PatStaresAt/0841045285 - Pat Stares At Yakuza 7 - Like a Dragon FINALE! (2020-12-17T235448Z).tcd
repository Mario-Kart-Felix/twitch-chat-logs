With haptic feedback and trigger resistance on the PS5, its a shame that we wont get remasters of games who could use cinematic uses of it. IE MGS3 having THAT scene be phyiscally hard for the player (And Snake) to do.

[0:36:51] <Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt "I know you're very busy and there's mustard at my table, but could you put the mustard on my hotdog instead of helping the other customers" is a real interaction I have had

[0:37:11] <mortificent> @atlasmccoy always, comrade
[0:37:11] <%TakingLifesL> @PatStaresAt not using a camera is the streamer equivalent of working from home

[0:38:03] <%BoxNavy> dude he ends his stream at 4 am

[0:38:09] <%linSP> its because vinny has resting bitch face
[0:38:10] <%saadi90> I work for an accounting firm and have been working from home for over 250 days and everyone has been a lot more productive
[0:38:10] <+AbnormalVoid> Vinny also works full time lol
[0:38:12] <%james_cest_drole> Working at a corner store with managers that dont believe covid exists im picking between my life and my life . America is hell
[0:38:13] <%linSP> and expresses nothing
[0:38:13] <%radda343> I'm a security guard in an office building full of lawyers and these motherfuckers are still coming in on weekends, often flouting mask mandates because fuck me I guess
[0:38:13] <+coupdegrayce> I do phone customer service, the fire alarm went off and I told the person I needed to go and she screamed at me that I has better not hang up on her and I told her there might be a fire and I could die and she screamed that she would get me fired if I hung up. Which I did. Then when we got back inside she called back and Really tried to demand I be fired. My boss told her to buzz off
[0:38:15] <%KineKithZen> There are successful streamers that never do facecam

[0:38:17] <%walternatorz> ...is that's what happening when Pat's off camera?
[0:38:18] <Blank9> The office is the boomer's social space. They can't function without it, and want everyone on it.
[0:38:18] <%SuperCeller2> It's all the pizza
[0:38:20] <%Kataguro> And then you have Jerma

[0:39:03] <cubelock555> one of them streams from their car
[0:39:03] <%walternatorz> ...is this what Pat's like with the camera off?..
[0:39:04] <%SuperCeller2> I like pizza
[0:39:06] <%SaiyanShoto> Max I think had two 9 hour streams back to back
[0:39:06] <%RealThiele> fuck it thats why
[0:39:06] <+Mendin> Coco Kiruu shaves her legs on stream so
[0:39:09] <+Gespens> Pekora apparently streams in her old PJs
[0:39:11] <tsnakesrule> Did you see the fuckin shit Nyanners was doing?
[0:39:13] <%radda343> Kiryu Coco has already exposed her roommate Kanata doing most everything in a tshirt and no pants
[0:39:13] <+king_of_beggars> Callie recently had a stream reading manga about vtubers and there was a guy who streamed naked because he was a big perv.
[0:39:15] <RyuuAoi> Crazy Talk activated
[0:39:15] <Darthkitten_Prime> I can absolutely see Cali doing that.
[0:39:16] <%Hoot_Patoots> some of them litteraly brag about their filth
[0:39:16] <overlordkog> Kanata has admitted to streaming in the nude.
[0:39:17] <%superc37> @patstaresat funfact: gawr once ate a pizza in the bathtub and ate it after it fell in the water
[0:39:19] <+twohitgood> but we love your face, pat.
[0:39:20] <%barrakuta371> Pat Toilet Vtuber when?

[0:39:25] <Doomstar16> I wish I had that shirt.
[0:39:25] <+Gespens> Noel streams dressed up but that is because she does ASMR recordings afterwards
[0:39:27] <%cylish> are they @GeneralSCPatton? are they though?
[0:39:28] <%Kataguro> New boot goofin
[0:39:31] <Doomstar16> That's a really nice shirt.

[0:40:09] <Guardiansaiyan> test
[0:40:10] <bob900000> wow
[0:40:10] <%SuperCeller2> I already forgot I own that game
[0:40:12] <+Pyroclase> Honestly I'm really enjoying the Cyberpunk story. And i'm baffled by how much slice of lif it is?
[0:40:12] <%twistedj3ster> Panam is babe
[0:40:12] <%gnarly_memes_bro> THE OBLY ENDING
[0:40:12] <%Razputin217> quiettShrug
[0:40:13] <%KineKithZen> Having fun despite occasional bugs myself
[0:40:13] <%BoxNavy> man now i really wanna go back and play that game
[0:40:14] <+BloodyBurney> When's the next shy stream, cuz i wanna hear that conversation
[0:40:14] <BlkFlameKami> yeah, bug fixes ain't saving that game
[0:40:15] <+Gespens> Korone and Okayu stream clothed because they spend a lot of time living with each other
[0:40:15] <%BoxNavy> YEP
[0:40:17] <%Starotter70> Oh yeah
[0:40:17] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Just one of those companies you wait a year to buy/play a game.

[0:40:19] <%cylish> @GeneralSCPatton Sus

[0:40:20] <%themememovement> My sister beat the game and rips me to shreds whenever I criticize it. its kind of hilarious.
[0:40:21] <CappuccinoGuil> sure does!
[0:40:21] <%Hoot_Patoots> as an indie....yeah
[0:40:21] <mortificent> IT DOES
[0:40:22] <Meekest> Cyberpunk will win all the awards next year
[0:40:22] <+LotS__> yes
[0:40:23] <zachataxx> I can't say if it's really that bad, but having all your endings be decided by one choice at the end is pretty stupid
[0:40:23] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Which one doesn't
[0:40:24] <Blank9> I've seen streams where people get one ending, and the epilogues show dialogue for DIFFERENT ENDINGS
[0:40:24] <%TIME_PUNCHER> i can't believe CDPR reskinned New Vegas and gave it more bugs
[0:40:24] <%kyh9> ONE ENDING
[0:40:25] <%SaiyanShoto> Could be worse
[0:40:25] <%PhantomMiG> Wait what happened just got in

[0:40:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I WANT 1998 BACK
[0:40:27] <8hoursofdrugs> the big CDPR corpo letdown was the real cyberpunk all along
[0:40:27] <RetributionP> GTA V has more choice
[0:40:27] <CappuccinoGuil> VIDEOGAMES WERE A MISTAKE
[0:40:28] <ChungusQuest> but Hades tho
[0:40:29] <%Mocking_Jason> are most of the problems with cyberpunk the kind that will be gone in a year?
[0:40:29] <%twistedj3ster> me too
[0:40:30] <%YakumoYomi> Hard to believe CDPR blew through their goodwill in a week
[0:40:31] <+RowenCleric> not it doesnt because we get gems like Yakuzies
[0:40:32] <%kyh9> FOUR ENDINGS, ONLY CHOSEN AT THE END
[0:40:33] <Virokwet> which one tho. none are perfect but i feel one is particularly depressing
[0:40:35] <leinadtonu> we picked the worst hobby...
[0:40:35] <%thbluewarden> video games are not great
[0:40:35] <SaltyAzteca> They cared about money so much that they forgot how video games were video games
[0:40:36] <ZComiX> HE SAID IT PACK IT UPU

[0:46:26] <%brachydios777> YE
[0:46:27] <mike2hands> YAKUSIS ON SPACE
[0:46:27] <Zeikier> Yakuza: Like A Eagle
[0:46:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> call it "Mafia"
[0:46:30] <%Puhff> no
[0:46:31] <%twistedj3ster> Ichiban goes to New York
[0:46:31] <%Yautjabutts> yakuza goes west and they can bring back Kaoru
[0:46:34] <%kewlmyc> Courage the Cowardly Dog, right?
[0:46:41] <%TheNewJapanGuy> I could say where they're going but I won't
[0:46:45] <%baka_sugoi> yakuza like a yankee
[0:46:46] <%TakingLifesL> Empire of Sin is not bad it's just not really limited in gameplay
[0:46:49] <+GrandmasterBFunk> DONT GET IN THE KILN
[0:46:51] <%weissguard> Make Ichiban Punch Out Cthulhu Next Game
[0:46:51] <+Godlike_Turtle> First time tuning in to my favorite GOBLIN!!!
[0:46:55] <%dave323dave> which city would ichiban hang out in?
[0:46:55] <SaltyAzteca> if they go west they'll be american gangsters
[0:46:55] <Saltmeisterr> THE KILN
[0:47:00] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Ichiban in the US would be cool
[0:47:01] <marvel877> Don't what?
[0:47:02] <Torgue_1> @Rowlander Brenda, not John
[0:47:07] <%StaceMcGate> GET OUTTA THE KILN
[0:47:07] <+tweedler92> GET OUTOF THE KILN
[0:47:08] <%sonofthedeepsouth> mellow
[0:47:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> @grandmasterbfunk Get in the kiln?
[0:47:10] <8hoursofdrugs> don't put your dvd box set of The Crown in the kiln
[0:47:10] <dan_g_v> cummies
[0:47:12] <%TakingLifesL> is really limited in gameplay* is what i meant
[0:47:13] <%YakumoYomi> @kewlmyc Yep. The mallet part was a Courage reference
[0:47:13] <%AlphaRayAllen> A nice chilled take
[0:47:19] <%RealThiele> snap anger versus thought out
[0:47:21] <OneThousandTomatoes> freezer burn
[0:47:21] <SomersaultJustice> warm takes
[0:47:22] <RyuuAoi> psaDogchamp VICIOUS
[0:47:23] <CoffeeSlice> :D
[0:47:26] <UlriktheSlayer1> oh
[0:47:26] <%baka_sugoi> calm yet deadly
[0:47:26] <%sonofthedeepsouth> polish and scams
[0:47:28] <%AlphaRayAllen> Literally unplayable on the consoles it was made for
[0:47:29] <necroanatomy> It's because of the dark glare
[0:47:30] <UlriktheSlayer1> :(
[0:47:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> WHOA
[0:47:30] <$velgaduere> iced tea
[0:47:32] <%revenantseo> Is it a scam if it's just incompetence?
[0:47:32] <%KeiganOfAstora> agregious
[0:47:33] <RetributionP> yeah big oof
[0:47:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> SAY AGREGIOUS
[0:47:35] <%themememovement> It just occurred to me. Ichiban's hair is that way because he had a bad barber. Does that mean his hair will be normal in future games? or is he gonna like, just pretend his hair naturally curly?
[0:47:36] <%machshop> i dunno it's pretty fun
[0:47:37] <+Pyroclase> It's... honestly just a normal AAA open world game with too much money and hype thrown at it.
[0:47:38] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> They're fishing for cash.
[0:47:38] <Profmcstevie> The sizzle or the deep burn
[0:47:38] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> ...I like it
[0:47:39] <%sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:47:39] <%twistedj3ster> Underneath everything, there's a good game there
[0:47:41] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> isn't that a tuatology
[0:47:43] <+GrandmasterBFunk> @GeneralSCPatton Ohyoubloodyboys GET OUT OF THE KILN
[0:47:46] <%bigbrothergannon> ooooooof
[0:47:46] <gallohuegos> I feel kinda bad for mike pondsmith
[0:47:46] <+Godlike_Turtle> brucegGoosewing2 brucegGoosehead brucegGoosewing
[0:47:47] <Tha_Mik> Well
[0:47:48] <zachataxx> It pretty much is since you couldn't record any footage of it before it's release
[0:47:49] <%TheWinged7> ahhh, so an Aliens: Colonial Marines?
[0:47:49] <+Pyroclase> And nah, there's plenty of cool missions later in the game.
[0:47:50] <%코코꾸라> yeah that's not true
[0:47:53] <%kyh9> Do you think they always intended to have Keanu Reeves take up most of the budget?
[0:47:53] <%cylish> HOW IS 7 YEARS NO TIME?
[0:47:54] <ChungusQuest> so it's a NMS but on purpose?
[0:47:54] <%cvp5127> looks like it
[0:47:57] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> bringing a taste of cyberpunk to the real world
[0:47:57] <%LegendGHT> is he still reading sub messages? I missed mine
[0:47:59] <%QuipSan> Cube World was the biggest scam
[0:47:59] <+mashinchaserr> they had 8 years?
[0:48:01] <%KineKithZen> I'm going to come back to it in 6 months, we'll see if they can pull off a NMS
[0:48:06] <%baka_sugoi> brucegGoosewing2 brucegGoosehead brucegGoosewing
[0:48:11] <ateeeeez> @themememovement there's a party chat where he sort of accepts it as his new look now
[0:48:11] <%Ynkubus_> Least we have Cyberpunk RED for good ol pnp
[0:48:14] <%Daxalog> Oh shit
[0:48:14] <+Godlike_Turtle> Fighting an end boss on Yakuza LaD right now
[0:48:15] <%TinyLittleDancer> SO scathing
[0:48:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> nikkib12Sad
[0:48:18] <mortificent> <3 <3 <3
[0:48:19] <Broken_Sonex> It was a good hustle on CDPR's part
[0:48:21] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @cylish You'd be amazed how much time an incompetent studio can completely waste.
[0:48:22] <%kyh9> When you announce your game, that's the start of your dev cycle as far as I'm concerned
[0:48:23] <%Alazull> I'm sorry, but nah, it is not Colonial Marines. It's just they overpromised and hid it.
[0:48:23] <%brachydios777> Sorry man
[0:48:25] <xbb1024> Hello everyone

[0:52:15] <%BoxNavy> yes :)
[0:52:16] <%medusasghost> its true
[0:52:16] <%Fooguwu> Which is ironic since the SJW cabal thinks the game is transphobic for... having trans people in it

[1:15:11] <+WutangchickeN> LUL
[1:15:12] <%McSoliace> psn deleting cyberpunk
[1:15:19] <%gnarly_memes_bro> I played for 2 hours and was beyond bored
[1:15:21] <Darren716> And full refunds for anyone on playstation
[1:15:22] <%themememovement> I have a bad feeling Yakuza 7 didn't sell well. I'm checking Steam reviews and it has lime 3000 ratings versus 0's 22k ratings.
[1:15:23] <%MrBleeeh> holy shit
[1:15:27] <%brachydios777> Cyberpunk is the fallout 76 of 2020
[1:15:37] <%themememovement> *like
[1:15:41] <smuggleruncle> holy shit what
[1:15:42] <Darren716> I feel so vindicated after Sony told me to wait for patches in an email yesterday
[1:15:48] <+FlongBongle> yakuza 7 is so good tho
[1:15:53] <UlriktheSlayer1> @machshop i am enjoying it too even on ps4 it has crashed and has glitches but like its still somewhat fun and the story hasnt blown ass yet
[1:16:00] <seaechiowai> How hard will Pat cheat off screen today?
[1:16:07] <%McSoliace> pat is probably laughing super hard right now mid-shit
[1:16:08] <%Some_DOOD> Thanks for the 2020Snacking @dooscent
[1:16:09] <+WutangchickeN> @brachydios777 I dunno bro 76 never got DELISTED, did I?
[1:16:12] <%BonemanShow> Yakuza 7 GOTY honestly
[1:16:15] <%cache_22> Sony has a page on their website playstation dot com /en-us/cyberpunk-2077-refunds/ now
[1:16:16] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@cache_22) (warning)
[1:16:17] <%CrowbarFacelift> I beat Yakuza LaD yesterday and Nishiki's voice actor fuckin' killed it. Had me in tears.
[1:16:18] <+WutangchickeN> *it
[1:16:19] <%코코꾸라> I beat it yesterday on PS5, it was a pretty bug-free run but damn the crashes. I had like 60 crashes in 62 hours.
[1:16:27] <cardamomo88> happy cancel my preorder
[1:16:31] <eco419> Cheat??? you mean poop ? Kappa Kappa
[1:16:38] <%pat_cchan> yeah yakuza got shafted at the game awards imo
[1:16:45] <+FlongBongle> i been tryna get my friends to check out yakuza 7 but only schut gaem vineSchut
[1:16:46] <%themememovement> Yeah but its so weird. I remember when the game launched I tried looking up lets plays and reviews and it was quiet as hell. Anything attached to it had no views. I'm super afraid the game will be a flop.
[1:16:47] <xbb1024> The game never passed PS4 certification, so it makes sense that it got removed
[1:16:47] <%BonemanShow> @cocokkura Right I hate that bout it
[1:16:53] <Darren716> I've had it crash like 4 times, it just did like 10 minutes ago
[1:16:59] <%honeyman18> Gift keeps on Giving
[1:16:59] <%YakumoYomi> @themememovement Don't worry too much. PC has traditionally been a weak platform for Yakuza games. The bulk of the sales are going to be on consoles.
[1:17:01] <%twistedj3ster> but the game awards don't matter
[1:17:03] <%gnarly_memes_bro> bro the game throws you into a fucking montage within the first 20 minutes that explains why you're friends with the other main character. this game is beyond rushed
[1:17:05] <seaechiowai> desmon6Momoko
[1:17:08] <+Plus_On_Black> Hahahaha PS not playing bullshit
[1:17:11] <%brachydios777> THE GIGA BOTCH
[1:17:17] <cardamomo88> honestly the VGA were so ducking bad
[1:17:19] <Broken_Sonex> I only had one crash and one nasty bug in my run.
[1:17:24] <%themememovement> maybe when it comes to PS5 it'll perform better
[1:17:31] <%BonemanShow> @pat_cchan Seriously I’m happy it got nominated but I think it still should have won best rpg
[1:17:31] <%코코꾸라> @BonemanShow For real, I was quicksaving every 30 seconds to make sure I didn't lose a lot of progress when a crash happened
[1:17:36] <smuggleruncle> i got it on pc and refunded after i realized it's simply unfinished - still wanna play it in future
[1:17:36] <%코코꾸라> AND IT CRASHED DURING THE CREDITS
[1:17:51] <%walternatorz> I expect Pat is not just washing his hands but his butthole as well
[1:17:52] <%pat_cchan> @themememovement flop in the west or not, Nagoshi confirmed in the anniversary stream that they’ve started the next game already
[1:17:52] <mortificent> yeah, iirc Yakuza does really well on Sony platforms usually
[1:17:53] <$MrPedrovsky> Dunno what is up with you guys. 2077 works like a dream on my adidas powered PC LUL
[1:17:55] <+CoasterTheDimwitt> Sales for Yakuza 7 actually look great right now, based off steam sales estimations alone
[1:18:01] <%gnarly_memes_bro> I haven't had any actual performance issues but the game just doesn't feel good to play
[1:18:04] <eco419> man the game awards are getting worst each year
[1:18:07] <%laazybulbasaur> THEY ARE REMOVING CYBERPUNK FROM PSN
[1:18:14] <%brachydios777> @coasterthedimwitt SICK
[1:18:17] <+FlongBongle> wait for real
[1:18:23] <tsnakesrule> No yeah, i havent had 7 crash at all
[1:18:26] <Darren716> THE REFUND PAGE 404'D
[1:18:26] <%laazybulbasaur> YES
[1:18:29] <TheFramedWarlock> Wait what ? Are they actually removing it ?
[1:18:31] <%Cykron> GOOD
[1:18:32] <+CoasterTheDimwitt> It is practically guranteed that the West has sold more than the asian release had 6 months from its released
[1:18:32] <%themememovement> Huh, I thought thered be more buzz around Yakuza 7 tho. it doesn't seem like it's hitting the same way 0 did.
[1:18:36] <%cache_22> Sony put of a refund page just for Cyberpunk 2077 and delisted the game from PSN until further notice.
[1:18:36] <Darren716> YES
[1:18:38] <%brachydios777> Does that include PS5?

[1:30:29] <TheHeroAppears> nice
[1:30:29] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt at least one of the good things about them pulling the game from the store is now they are FORCED to make the game in a good state or their company will implode as opposed to the "take the money and run" approach other failing games did (e.g. Anthem)

[1:30:56] <ullyzeez> lets goooooo
[1:30:57] <%Ritei> you just caused the remaining twists to stop existing
[1:30:57] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> The letter was for Daigo all along.

[1:31:02] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> Soapy Ichi actually gets secks at the end SPOILER
[1:31:03] <butthurtdave> Hey speaking of, did anybody play Yakuza 3? :^)
[1:31:04] <%miguelrod777> The twist is that none of this was I'm ichibans head
[1:31:04] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> It's a simulation in an alien world
[1:31:04] <$realm_forge> SNAPE KILLS DUMBLEDORE
[1:31:07] <OneThousandTomatoes> @patstaresat if it doesn't happen will you tell us what you thought it was
[1:31:07] <%BinaryFireball> you have to show us your prediction after for proof
[1:31:07] <BrickleBork> what a tweest
[1:31:07] <SaltyAzteca> I bet Ichi's dad is actually alive, thats my guess
[1:31:10] <%HiddenDM> The yakuza was the friends we made along the way.
[1:31:11] <%Dementedpenguin> Yakuza has just about as many twists as Metal Gear
[1:31:14] <+king_of_beggars> Don't look up the lyrics to the song that plays at the end while on stream. You will cry like a baby.
[1:31:16] <+Valison> @PatStaresAt Why aren't you making your prediction now, rather than later when no one will believe you regardless of evidence
[1:31:17] <%BoxNavy> it work
[1:31:18] <cardamomo88> IT WAS THE DOGS FAULT

[1:31:25] <cheerthisdan> OOPS ALL TWISTS
[1:31:30] <saddest_man> What is the twist PAT
[1:31:33] <%RAAAAAINMAKER> The final twist is that there is no twist
[1:31:34] <butthurtdave> The twist is Aoki is actually Ichiban's father
[1:31:35] <%miguelrod777> WE CANT TRUST THAT
[1:31:35] <%UvBenServed> The persimmon was your father all along
[1:31:36] <%jillpilled> Daigo was Kiryu's treasure LUL
[1:31:36] <@StridentSong> And because Chat will spoil him

[1:31:42] <@SoFarFetched> No save it.
[1:31:42] <%revenantseo> @Valison because people will tell him if he's right or not and ruin it

[1:33:07] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt I mean chat might just tell you you're right or wrong regardless
[1:33:09] <RamblinEvilRyan> That’s assuming your guess is right
[1:33:10] <%tigerfang86> Chat is all One Guys
[1:33:13] <%TheWinged7> The real ending is Pat shits his pants from Chilli damage
[1:33:14] <%Bailey__gaming> BIG TWISTS BIG FINALE
[1:33:14] <%tigerfang86> Chat is collectively, one guy
[1:33:17] <PkSilent01> Ok but serious question @PatStaresAt when Cyperpunk isn't a smoldering piece of shit, you still going to play it or just drop it entirely.

[1:34:37] <%Aydarkzero> @Mr_Misanthropy i've never played a Yakuza game
[1:34:37] <%Brain_Freeze_> Theres at least 1 or 2 more twists probably
[1:34:41] <%MikeTD81> I repeat all the yakuza games in 2020
[1:34:43] <mannywatcha> Go Ichiban bring the Yakuza back to life.
[1:34:45] <Daniel_Is_I> FAT EVIL

[1:35:07] <%CelioHogane> @Darren716 Nah, he went to "the bathroom"

[1:35:08] <cheerthisdan> Sourpls
[1:35:08] <+Mr_Misanthropy> @Aydarkzero I've played like 4 hours of 0. but it got lost in the backlog
[1:35:10] <primarch_lupercal> feel like there should have been music there?
[1:35:10] <%cache_22> That was the super budget cutscene.
[1:35:12] <%toastybites> was that a bug
[1:35:13] <%jillpilled> Mirror Face psaMenace
[1:35:17] <%Legitknighthawk> default 'I'LL KILL YOU'
[1:35:21] <lem______> GDI what did i miss tonight
[1:35:25] <%Kurgash> So I feel bad for my brother in law. My future wife got him the Xbox one version of cyberpunk and now I think he’s dead, we haven’t heard from him.
[1:35:27] <3Xgilly> Someone wanted their neckbeard in the cutscene
[1:35:27] <%patriotrenegade> Fat people have more health, its just a scientific fact
[1:35:27] <Darren716> Ahh
[1:35:35] <%emperordread> What is this? Cyberpunk?
[1:35:36] <+TaylOctopus91> Silverhand Johnny2077 Silverhand
[1:35:38] <%MikeTD81> he just started
[1:35:39] <%walternatorz> cyberpunk is leaking now that nothing can contain it
[1:35:41] <Blank9> missed nothing, it started 5 minutes ago
[1:35:41] <%MidnightBurst12> the "i'll kill you" was implied
[1:35:42] <%toastybites> @lem______ sony pulled cyberpunk from the playstation store
[1:35:42] <susukouhai> superchunk ate the budget
[1:35:45] <%bluescreen1988> its just a weird scene
[1:35:46] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> wtf was that sword
[1:35:53] <lem______> FUKIn sik
[1:35:55] <seaechiowai> @lem______ he started like 2 minutes ago
[1:35:56] <SwindlerOfProgress> It SUPER is
[1:35:58] <%patriotrenegade> look at that badass with two kukri
[1:36:03] <OneThousandTomatoes> @patriotrenegade we have more energy stores 4Head
[1:36:03] <lem______> head trauma is amazing for its cost
[1:36:06] <%AlphaRayAllen> Automatic knockdown is sick
[1:36:08] <SwindlerOfProgress> And it's basically free, it's crazy
[1:36:09] <%COMB711> I think combo beat is really really good
[1:36:11] <Blank9> head trauma does like extreme damage despite being 6 MP and saying light
[1:36:12] <wrydiculous> head trauma is too good
[1:36:13] <Ultimatefool> Head trauma does so much damage for its low MP
[1:36:18] <cheerthisdan> Head trauma is the best low cost skill in the game
[1:36:18] <%jillpilled> [...] (I'LL KILL YOU)
[1:36:21] <%tigerfang86> THE FATTEST EVIL
[1:36:22] <boomstickery> dual weilding kukuris is cool
[1:36:26] <YeetBoss> woolies level of not giving a fuck about Cyberpunk is legendary
[1:36:27] <+Mr_Misanthropy> These seems like if yakuza and persona had a baby at first glance.
[1:36:28] <mannywatcha> Left fatty for last
[1:36:30] <ghoostyberry> why don't you make korean vergil a bodyguard so he can have Japanese sword
[1:36:33] <Huntercd> Does Saeko have a magical girl wand?
[1:36:33] <%tigerfang86> cause he's THICC with defense I guess
[1:36:37] <%Dakuu75> because Ichi is strong against BAT-damage?
[1:36:40] <%patriotrenegade> hes the tank,
[1:36:42] <%tigerfang86> of course she does
[1:36:45] <eco419> THICC
[1:36:51] <%COMB711> beat him all the way to the bar
[1:36:53] <%revenantseo> this guy is the most durable enemy in the game and I don't know why
[1:36:54] <%Brain_Freeze_> Is that enemy using one of the Hero Bat models/
[1:36:56] <%Kataguro> Push him to Kamurocho
[1:36:57] <+King_floppy> some moves are weird with damage yeah. I've found Peppermint Blow do deal massive damage all the time despite being 'medium'
[1:36:58] <Blank9> lucky punch on eri is one of the strongest single target moves too
[1:37:02] <mannywatcha> Watch him be teleported back
[1:37:05] <%코코꾸라> Send him back to Tokyo
[1:37:07] <%linSP> yeyeye
[1:37:09] <UlriktheSlayer1> im excited to see the ending
[1:37:11] <%Piemono> That guy is beefy
[1:37:19] <+Chronobot> Hes gonna hit the persimmon tree
[1:37:19] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> lucky punch for eri is great too
[1:37:20] <%Dakuu75> this is goofy lol. look how far they have to RUN XD
[1:37:21] <Tha_Mik> How far can we get
[1:37:22] <%revenantseo> he'll eventually teleport back
[1:37:28] <Ultimatefool> For safety
[1:37:30] <eco419> LUL
[1:37:31] <+CaptCynical> for the love of God just use your skills
[1:37:35] <+TaylOctopus91> Cardio man
[1:37:36] <%walternatorz> watch speed running strats focus solely on boss positioning to minimize distance traveled
[1:37:37] <%honeyman18> if you wait he comes back to you
[1:37:38] <%Reveresao> Fuck should I just return my physical copy of CP2077? I put it on the shelf until patches, fuck. NotLikeThis

[1:37:40] <%iosephe> To avoid moving too far our of the fight area

[2:34:44] <Broken_Sonex> @wruce__billis Tell him. Don't be vague.
[2:34:45] <ape_hawk> Imagine if your RL friend was like "yo, you should finish any side-quests you have laying around before taking a dump in that gas station bathroom"
[2:34:45] <%CrankyVT> Just make just you got Peerless Resolve on
[2:34:46] <%revenantseo> You can just use Peerless Resolve
[2:34:47] <%SvenHolgersson> Just don't die stupid
[2:34:49] <%SvenHolgersson> Gawd
[2:34:51] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt Ichiban also has an ability called Peerless REsolve
[2:34:57] <hassanico2> Zhao feels at home :)
[2:34:57] <%BonemanShow> Well he’s definitely gonna die cause he’s under leveled lol
[2:34:57] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @PatStaresAt The best part is that you could totally tell Ichiban "Finish all your sidequests first" and he'd totally understand and not think it was weird because he's insane.
[2:34:59] <%DocChutney> use peerless resolve it does that effect at will on kasuga
[2:35:01] <jrpg_torkelson> I love Zhao so much.
[2:35:02] <%reonome> fuck now I'm hungry
[2:35:02] <+CaptCynical> join hi Jan has dialogue at stardust

[2:35:14] <%BonemanShow> Then again he has a bunch of money so who cares
[2:35:15] <cardamomo88> MSG
[2:35:19] <%krispen_wa> Zhao's HELL STEW
[2:35:21] <Pookiedaexzile> So how many Ichibans does it take to make a Kiryu again
[2:35:25] <Pookiedaexzile> like 7 right
[2:35:25] <zachataxx> Real facts
[2:35:30] <JayCWayC> Zhao doesn't season his chicken.
[2:35:33] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @
[2:35:34] <%weissguard> LUL
[2:35:34] <%SickJester> Just make sure you poisin him. He has a extra juicy health bar.
[2:35:35] <+frogurtz> That is true
[2:35:36] <Redahoge10> can zhao even class change into a chef?
[2:35:36] <%LadyRarityV> LUL LUL
[2:35:38] <jrpg_torkelson> Zhao as chef does crazy damage
[2:35:38] <%Alazull> Gibe item nao thx
[2:35:43] <%linSP> "are we fuckin serious rn guys?"
[2:35:45] <Maleicus> not a chili shrimp guy?
[2:35:46] <%DrJamesWoods> LUL
[2:35:46] <primarch_lupercal> zhao's cooking spin off game
[2:35:47] <dreamfillah> Pat would know about the dangers of Chili
[2:35:47] <%baronouroboros> I wonder if the residents of Kamourocho anxiously look up at the Millennium Tower every other day
[2:35:49] <+JohnXuandou> @PatStaresAt instead of the stone, if you have a Substitution Charm you should equip that isntead
[2:35:51] <mannywatcha> Not seasoning Chicken is a sin
[2:35:53] <Ultimatefool> Zhao would fight GOrdon Ramsay to the death
[2:35:53] <%hrbeck_> Nanba reminds me of a friend of mine, same demeanor, same voice, his brother also got killed
[2:35:54] <livi242> cool spoilers chat
[2:35:56] <Blank9> weird pathing probably
[2:35:57] <%baka_sugoi> more pixles
[2:36:00] <KawaiiMess> chili shrimp gang
[2:36:01] <Daniel_Is_I> "Put more graphics in Kamurocho!"
[2:36:04] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt There's way more people around at all times no?
[2:36:04] <+king_of_beggars> This area plays like butter on PS5
[2:36:05] <+Pyroclase> I'm having a great day, playing Planetside
[2:36:07] <ghostkingwho> Ichiban is probably yakuza 4 Akiyama power level
[2:36:10] <%cache_22> They moved the graphics slider up a couple pegs for LAD Kamurocho.
[2:36:12] <%SickJester> Cooking with Zhao
[2:36:14] <%honeyman18> I think the year of making this game a different genre did more than people think
[2:36:15] <championofsomeone> Kamurocho here is almost the exact same as in judgment
[2:36:16] <TheHeroAppears> @hrbeck_ I think you missed some of the story lol
[2:36:16] <%VoidBaronJules> going from kiwami 2 to 7, they def added some more effects
[2:36:17] <jrpg_torkelson> Tune up the graphics on Level 3

[2:48:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Ultimatefool oh boy who wants a DRM that scans you computer every time you boot up
[2:48:51] <lucky_icarus> I hope so. I just got denied a refund so I'd like a second chance.
[2:48:52] <eco419> LuvPeekR
[2:48:55] <Darren716> I don't think Xbox will because they were the main platform on ads
[2:48:56] <%Mantorok06> Well, the PC version isn't exactly too broken
[2:48:58] <%BoxNavy> steam has games that just dont open
[2:48:58] <%Sol_Install> steam isn"t?
[2:48:59] <akitanito> use slash
[2:48:59] <%Dunmarkh> The real powerplay would be good old games taking down cyberpunk
[2:48:59] <%bluescreen1988> im enjoying cyberpunk but it deserves all the shit its getting
[2:49:00] <+machinetoys> I missed a whole-ass party member, how do you get her?
[2:49:02] <%Mantorok06> "playable"
[2:49:02] <TheRadIdeaMan> Steam *might* but I doubt it
[2:49:02] <%NovaKnightmare> the thing is the PC is not having such issues like the ps4 did
[2:49:02] <UlriktheSlayer1> its not like as bad on pc and next gen consoles
[2:49:04] <dreamfillah> nah, cause PC versions not as egregiously scuffed
[2:49:04] <hassanico2> @DestroyerPhoenix Dude you know it's DRAGON in all caps
[2:49:05] <jrpg_torkelson> Steam doesn't give a fuck about anyone
[2:49:05] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Hell Fallout 76 or Life of Tiger didn't get pulled
[2:49:06] <xbb1024> You can easily get a refund on Steam, but thats the platform where it works
[2:49:07] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> theyd probably turn it into early access or something
[2:49:08] <tanarath> YEAH, CYBERPUNK COMMERCIAL
[2:49:08] <%the22cstomp> it ""works"" on pc so it wont
[2:49:09] <%ConLin_Arts_> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:49:11] <zoldknight> They already are pretty lenient by nature.
[2:49:12] <UlriktheSlayer1> it makes sense it would be like this for last gen stuff
[2:49:12] <+king_of_beggars> Why get refund? You're just going to have to buy it again later when they fix it.
[2:49:13] <%ConLin_Arts_> SourPls
[2:49:13] <%BinaryFireball> im betting on putting into my steam wallet might give me some headway
[2:49:13] <jamox1> Damn this is wild
[2:49:14] <mannywatcha> That's so sad for Cyperpunk for real, they tried so hard. And delayd and everything. This is definitely gonna be a What happun with Matt
[2:49:14] <RetributionP> there is 2 post game dungeons do the easy one plz
[2:49:15] <%linSP> steam should just delist the game and not give refunds
[2:49:17] <TheRadIdeaMan> I mean they bowed oretty hard on paid mods
[2:49:18] <%Daxalog> No man sky was lenient on refunds on steam.

[2:56:10] <Jalexster> There is a really, really, really long boss fight coming up
[2:56:11] <%AlphaRayAllen> There's a post-credit scene I believe
[2:56:12] <+GingerStrawhat> Cyberpunk actually really reminds me of Base Vampire: The Massquarade. A really ambitious game that has a lot of cool things in it, but the game part and the performance part is the worse part of the whole thing

In fact, some of the strongest Taiwanese independent movement is from Japan, yet they can't officially admitt it in any capacity.

[2:57:57] <%medusasghost> zymp
[2:57:57] <hassanico2> @Ixek Vinny Vinesauce said that doesn't apply to individual streamers so I'm not sure?
[2:57:58] <Daniel_Is_I> And then they retroactively banned someone for previously saying simp
[2:58:00] <dreamfillah> going "No, it's the children who are wrong"

[2:58:06] <%SaiyanShoto> Then why did someone get their channel banned for just saying the word
[2:58:06] <%StaceMcGate> "Our policy prohibits the use of terms like “simp,” “incel” or “virgin” specifically when they are being used to negatively refer to another person’s sexual practices. Using these terms on their own wouldn’t lead to an enforcement but we would take action if they were used repeatedly in a harassing manner."

[3:16:40] <+fetrigon> barely did 200 LUL
[3:16:42] <%SaiyanShoto> I think he's less resistant to magic
[3:16:43] <+loukemia83> @patstaresat Namba has lightning magic
[3:16:44] <+PR0swagonist> he's a real dragon level threat
[3:16:46] <%honeyman18> Your high damage multi hit moves do more damage sine he tanks the extremes
[3:16:46] <a_mad_dragon> DODGEROLL
[3:16:47] <Doomstar16> This is going to be one of those fights huh.

[3:16:54] <%baronouroboros> In Yakuza, a few people are just inexplicably superhuman
[3:16:55] <mannywatcha> HE RESIST THE PEPPER!
[3:16:55] <WeebFever> He resists pepper, he's unbeatable
[3:16:58] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt dragon's remain weak to ice.
[3:16:58] <%krispen_wa> EVEN PEPPER DOES NOTHING
[3:16:59] <%UvBenServed> HE RESISTED PEPPER. TOO OP
[3:16:59] <%jillpilled> PEPPER
[3:17:00] <TheRadIdeaMan> Switch out for Adachi and use Paralyzing Blow, still has decent damage

[3:17:17] <%SirGO0SE> we must summon the dragon
[3:17:17] <%bevyrage> if he's dragon then lightning or ice right?
[3:17:17] <oldwest1234> Dragon = Ice right? It's that way in dragon quest and against kiryu?
[3:17:19] <ricky12k1> He is weak to electricity
[3:17:20] <tsnakesrule> He has no elec moves caht

[3:19:21] <dojimanodragoon> Pat use laser
[3:19:24] <butthurtdave> He's weak to Electric but he resists Blunt, that's why your Bat and Taser aren't doing numbers
[3:19:27] <Redahoge10> his nips must be so rigid right now

[3:20:34] <%Daxte_> Beeg damage
[3:20:35] <toadalonk> FORCAST
[3:20:36] <%krispen_wa> HOLY SHIT
[3:20:37] <%bevyrage> ah so it was physical lightning that he resisted
[3:20:37] <toadalonk> YEEES
[3:20:37] <%radda343> try fire
[3:20:37] <T_Sasquatch> loool i knew he was ignoring chat LUL
[3:20:38] <%bevyrage> weird
[3:20:39] <%R0bobot> This soundtrack ducks so much
[3:20:45] <Darren716> It's a physical attack too
[3:20:45] <xbb1024> orbital laser
[3:20:45] <ape_hawk> toldja, he's fukkin gyarados
[3:20:45] <$lotharrio> YEAH the PRONGS!
[3:20:47] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @bevyrage YEAH HE RESISTS LIGHTNING HUH
[3:20:47] <%honeyman18> Well shit, I just wailed on him for like half an hour
[3:20:48] <mannywatcha> That doesn't count?
[3:20:49] <KawaiiMess> OH NO
[3:20:51] <Doomstar16> Some lightning damage works and others don't.
[3:20:54] <ricky12k1> Finally
[3:20:54] <ghostkingwho> has Pat done Adachi essence of hell wheel?
[3:20:55] <%toastybites> Tendo is weak to the future
[3:20:55] <%notsoy> why does prongs do SO much damage, jeez
[3:20:56] <%linSP> i guess hes resist to status effects
[3:20:59] <jrpg_torkelson> Why didn't the Prongs count?
[3:21:00] <digitalbooklet> the prongs still do major damage its crazy
[3:21:01] <%GalacticaPhanto> I have to say that i love this soundtrack way more than 0 easy
[3:21:02] <%Daxalog> Resist bbut the dmg was good
[3:21:04] <KawaiiMess> pure magic elec works
[3:21:05] <Blank9> adachi's got some new essence moves that have fun animations
[3:21:07] <hollydayskz> gotta be the magic type
[3:21:07] <%xiidrifty> Tendo is weak to magic based elements I guess?
[3:21:08] <Broken_Sonex> @T_Sasquatch To fair Chat can be a prick
[3:21:08] <Darren716> Does Pat have Adachi's electric aoe?
[3:21:10] <%thegreatsun> Lighting + Magic
[3:21:11] <dojimanodragoon> Prongs are considered blunt
[3:21:11] <KawaiiMess> not phys elec
[3:21:12] <$lotharrio> Looks like magic lightning is better than physical lightning
[3:21:14] <oldwest1234> All the bosses in this game could use more turns and more attacks, maybe even some sort of armor piercing attack that can be perfect guarded, but ignores defense
[3:21:15] <TheRadIdeaMan> Prongs are a Problem Solver™
[3:21:16] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:21:16] <%StaceMcGate> THIS IS WHY YOU POISON
[3:21:17] <+fetrigon> pfffffft
[3:21:17] <+taggerung403> i think the phys takes priority over element
[3:21:18] <%thegreatsun> Not Lighting + Physical
[3:21:18] <%Ritei> need the kimchi
[3:21:19] <+Zadoulo> He's cheating!
[3:21:21] <%WhereIsWill> oh thats no good
[3:21:22] <%skyentombment> PAT, TRY YOUR SECRET TECHNIQUE: THE CHILLI DAMAGE
[3:21:23] <%bevyrage> i forgot this is dragon quest rules, so physical vs magic elements are different resistances
[3:21:25] <+Shadic790> Poison is funny on him
[3:21:25] <digitalbooklet> prongs are technically blunt damage, but the gear buff helps it
[3:21:26] <jrpg_torkelson> RIP Nanba
[3:21:27] <%goose_attack_almanac> Nanba has an Attack and Defense Debuff
[3:21:29] <tsnakesrule> Magic lighting only works chat, and the fortune teller is the only one with lightning that doesnt destroy MP
[3:21:30] <jrpg_torkelson> Too much aggro
[3:21:31] <Darren716> Isn't Ichi's weapon elec?
[3:21:32] <%MikeTD81> Orbital laser is lightning
[3:21:32] <%Xevtes> Xevtes subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Hey Pat & Paige! Thanks for all the laughs
[3:21:32] <akitanito> nanba gonna die
[3:21:33] <%seraphimjordan> adachi new eccence moves
[3:21:35] <+fetrigon> he said you gonna catch these hands
[3:21:35] <+loukemia83> @patstaresat Ichi can aoe heal too
[3:21:35] <Leddy_at_Home> @jrpg_torkelson It's considered Physical damage first, Tendo is weak to straight Electric Magic damage
[3:21:36] <%SickJester> try to poision him again. he can be poisioned.
[3:21:37] <%revenantseo> It's Dragon Quest, late-game bosses get two turns per round
[3:21:37] <butthurtdave> This is honestly a pretty easy fight, it's just arbitrarily long because of how high Tendo's HP and Defenses are
[3:21:37] <%drinkmoxie> Is there a lightning poundmate?
[3:21:38] <+fetrigon> LUL
[3:21:39] <%BinaryFireball> this fight becomes easy to lose
[3:21:42] <dojimanodragoon> Big damage if he’d use orbital
[3:21:43] <%notsoy> do you ahve the aoe stinky breath ability? that's super good for bosses
[3:21:44] <+LotS__> If it's both bludgeoning and lightning, it seems the bludgeoning resist takes precedence.
[3:21:45] <%gnarly_memes_bro> I literally beat this twice i know what works
[3:21:47] <+Jaromero435> Tendo is not afraid to hit a woman
[3:21:51] <%machshop> don't get cock
[3:21:51] <Blank9> ich's weapon is elec, but it's physical elec

[3:58:56] <%revenantseo> @PatStaresAt says the guy who called in backup 35 times last fight
[3:58:59] <%mister___doctor> "I'll fuck you up Ichi. HELP! HEEEELP!"
[3:58:59] <Doomstar16> He used to be a wheelchair bound weakguy. He probably can't fight.
[3:59:00] <$lotharrio> Just like in the entirety of the rest of the game. Never fights, waves a gun around, has other people do the work.
[3:59:00] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt How is this guy more of a loser than Jingu and Munakata combined?
[3:59:01] <LycheeMusings> He's basically shit jingu
[3:59:03] <%TissueBoxDan> this is a mirror of the jingu fight from yakuza 1 right

[4:51:07] <+hornydino_> Beat Kume to death
[4:51:07] <susukouhai> FUCK KUME
[4:51:07] <dark_mega_exe> Kume main villain of Yakuza 8 confirmed
[4:51:08] <%slrls_> Osaka Yakuza PMC!
[4:51:08] <%murderof_crows> Next game!
[4:51:08] <%jillpilled> Kume's gonan be in Yakuza 8 monkaS
[4:51:09] <RazYamiyo> Naw he in jail
[4:51:09] <Sulfur_Boride> Kume probably got shipped to jail, but just didn't show us.
[4:51:10] <CursedNobleman> He couldve saved aoki if he applied proper pressure to his wound right?!
[4:51:10] <%ConLin_Arts_> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[4:51:11] <%Polter_ge1st> Wow fuck Kume
[4:51:12] <%AlphaRayAllen> Nope
[4:51:13] <KirinoKosaka> VoteNay
[4:51:13] <%radda343> check out ichiban's new outfit
[4:51:14] <oldwest1234> I was praying that someone was gonna assassinate Kume by the end
[4:51:15] <eco419> LUL LUL LUL
[4:51:15] <%CrowbarFacelift> Oh interesting
[4:51:16] <%Ritei> @PatStaresAt might want to look up the cutscene for beating the extra dungeon boss since youre not doing it
[4:51:18] <+Zeromaru2> Thta was my guess
[4:51:19] <%reonome> that makes sense
[4:51:20] <%cylish> ICHI IS THE BEST GOD DAMN PROTAG FUCK
[4:51:21] <%SaiyanShoto> Thats a good guess
[4:51:21] <%baka_sugoi> YAKUZA HAVEN
[4:51:22] <@SoFarFetched> you tried Pat
[4:51:23] <redrins> he was alone in america tho
[4:51:24] <%coreyyotto> I think they did a pretty good job of setting up his motivations
[4:51:24] <sandsim> ooooh good theory
[4:51:24] <hassanico2> @PatStaresAt HOLY SHIT ENGLISH DATE IS VOICED BY GOOFY
[4:51:25] <%themememovement> Okay so is this better than Yakuza 0?
[4:51:25] <%Tinypidgenofdoom> Kume not only got away. HE ALSO STILL GOT VOTED IN @PatStaresAt
[4:51:25] <%CrowbarFacelift> That is pretty good!
[4:51:25] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Good guess.
[4:51:26] <%TheMattman1313> ...You can't transplant a lunch from a living person
[4:51:26] <T_Sasquatch> Super wrong LUL
[4:51:26] <%krispen_wa> KUME MAIN VILLAIN FOR YAKUZA 8
[4:51:26] <OneThousandTomatoes> i can see that
[4:51:27] <HeroToxiko> oh shit yeah he just got away
[4:51:27] <%AlphaRayAllen> No but that is an interesting plot hole
[4:51:29] <Darren716> Wait i thought that was Kume at the end?
[4:51:29] <zachataxx> @patstaresat Ichiban got a new costume for Hero
[4:51:29] <Monkeyweed21> What about the Coin Locker Baby gun @PatStaresAt
[4:51:29] <%SvenHolgersson> But like they didnt have his dads blood though
[4:51:29] <%Maids4lyfe> that made me cry, I love it
[4:51:29] <%furiousfurioso> Kume went super culty
[4:51:30] <%honeyman18> Kume was the true evil all along
[4:51:30] <%HiddenDM> That's a good guess!!
[4:51:30] <%missingangle> Like Aoki's an awful person, but Ichi's passion and devotion toward someone he considers a brother is what gets me. It's beautiful
[4:51:30] <CelestialCage> AMAZING
[4:51:31] <%medusasghost> GOTY
[4:51:31] <digitalbooklet> no final milennium tower??
[4:51:31] <$AzureGale> Kume gon' get got in 8
[4:51:32] <Hairy_butts> that's a good guess though
[4:51:32] <%BoxNavy> :) <3 yep
[4:51:32] <eco419> DID YOU ENJOY IT????
[4:51:33] <%MaddyCaddy> Fuck Cyberpunk

[4:51:34] <+sillyschlub> it's an interesting guess yeah
[4:51:34] <UlriktheSlayer1> yeah
[4:51:35] <+abrupt_abe> That ending is great
[4:51:35] <%SvenHolgersson> That makes no sense lol
[4:51:35] <SummonerMagno> thats actually smrt
[4:51:36] <SomeAsianDood> Kume turned himself in I think
[4:51:36] <%h0wiewong> I think it was growing up crippled and a crime boss' son and that fucked him up emotionally
[4:51:37] <Doomstar16> I love ichiban now.
[4:51:37] <%baka_sugoi> it was GOOD

[4:53:24] <%krispen_wa> Kiryu singlehandedly fucked up the Tojo clan for years bya ppointing Daigo. Kiryu is the worst Yakuza by far
[4:53:29] <%hrbeck_> stuff will come out
[4:53:29] <$lotharrio> Pat was fighting back crying because Daigo wasn't a bigger part of this game.

[4:53:54] <mannywatcha> This game taught me two things. That i can get a baby or a gun from coin lockers. Or you can beat up anyone if you have friends.
[4:53:54] <%jillpilled> It's true tho
[4:53:57] <xbb1024> but you can't actually get married in high school
[4:53:58] <@SoFarFetched> @SSaryn don't you mean Kuze? Kappa
[4:53:59] <heartlesshealer> CAN'T GET PREGNANT IN A POOL, PAIGE

[4:54:03] <%Reveresao> Imagine the Yakuza investor meeting but for CDPR LUL @PatStaresAt
[4:54:05] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Yakuza 8's story is gonna be that Kume revived the Omi Alliance and Ichiban has to revive the Tojo.
[4:54:08] <%baka_sugoi> Kume would be antag in 8
[4:54:10] <%BoxNavy> :)

[4:55:23] <saddest_man> You can buy your way back the start of the fight
[4:55:27] <butthurtdave> Actually the game will let you restart the fight from Tendo if he kills you, you just have to pay some of your cash to continue
[4:55:27] <ape_hawk> so did nanba and saeko hook up or what?

[4:56:41] <%Mahbonk> nah both definitely killed it. Especially with the ending
[4:56:43] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt you talked about Yakuza emotional ending on podcast vs the real ending
[4:56:44] <Darren716> You said the emotional ending was Chapter 12
[4:56:45] <+Genericho> "The emotional ending being 80%, while the full ending is 100%"
[4:56:45] <@SoFarFetched> OH I know
[4:56:45] <Blank9> you said arakawa's death was the emotional ending of the game
[4:56:46] <NeroInfinite> I bet futurecity10 is woolie's secret alt
[4:56:46] <SwindlerOfProgress> The Japanese voice acting was definitely better, in my opinion, but the English was great, too
[4:56:47] <fIashman92> You said the dad dying was the emotional peak
[4:56:47] <Tupperwarez> This is one of the best dubs that I've ever seen
[4:56:47] <%SaiyanShoto> Both are amazing, stop being weebs about which is better
[4:56:48] <SomeAsianDood> Chapter 12 Arakawa talking with Ichiban
[4:56:49] <%krispen_wa> During the podcast, you said that George Takei was the emotional ending
[4:56:49] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> the chapter 12 ending pat
[4:56:50] <+JohnXuandou> you said on the podcast that you reached the emotional ending of Yakuza 7
[4:56:50] <@SoFarFetched> They're talking ab out that chapter you ended off pat
[4:56:50] <%baka_sugoi> Lockers?
[4:56:52] <@SoFarFetched> Last week

[4:57:01] <%wruce__billis> NO YOU FUCKING WRRETN
[4:57:01] <Monkeyweed21> you said the story peaked at chapter 12

[4:57:05] <@SoFarFetched> Pat it might be they were talking about the c hapter you ended on last week
[4:57:08] <Darren716> No you were talking about chapter 12 in this game being the emotional ending
[4:57:09] <@SoFarFetched> cause that stressed you out
[4:57:09] <tanarath> Brain good
[4:57:10] <penitentpendant> Final talk with Arakawa, I assumed
[4:57:11] <@SoFarFetched> and got emotional
