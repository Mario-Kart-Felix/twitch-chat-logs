[1:44:57] <%ElenaManetta> I've always found dialogue like that and stuff like "What is happening!" or "What are you doing!" is filler dialogue because people tend not to like it when a character says nothing as a response.

[2:36:33] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat its even better if you think about how old these old men are. Kiryu is the old man but mr 110 year old man knows how to use technology

[2:36:39] <shmupdogjoe> Kiryu bones and then the series producer denies that it happened
[2:36:50] <shmupdogjoe> he is like an idol singer that way
[2:36:50] <+griffball13> that is not a random hobo
[2:36:52] <DatAsuna> not a rndom
[2:36:53] <%NovaKnightmare> but it wasnt a random hobo
[2:36:56] <@SSaryn> I thought you were gonna say the bull that was fought by an old man.
[2:36:57] <%NovaKnightmare> it was an important dude
[2:36:58] <McAngrimStein> A random hobo? are you serious
[2:36:59] <TheNocturnalScotsman> "random"

[2:37:14] <+Th3SmartAlec> WHO?!
[2:37:15] <hassanico> THIS IS PERSONAL
[2:37:16] <ShichiNoBushi> Even went to jail for 3 years for it.
[2:37:21] <majindusto> Oh Hamazaki
[2:37:25] <Dr_Mooose> would you try to take on Kiryu?
[2:37:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Wow, I can't believe Big Lo survived
[2:37:28] <gekizenbu> Kiryu it's BEEN personal this entire game
[2:37:29] <+FrostyAri> Pat.... what do you think some of the random battles are?
[2:37:29] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat that was in 2 where he gets stick by sengoku's dude
[2:37:32] <%Faustgesicht> OH it's personal now, after everything is solved?
[2:37:32] <Dest_121> he got stabbed in 2 as well @AngriestPat
[2:37:32] <redsynod> It's the least personal it's been
[2:37:32] <DRAGKUDO> isn't that literally the goons you fight randomly
[2:37:34] <gunzerkingdunce> Anyone know if Judgenent has pre order bonuses?
[2:37:37] <%Fidranth> eats the what??
[2:37:38] <+yoshkosh20> I just got here. who's that guy pat kidnapped?
[2:37:38] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pat you're constantly attacked by thugs.
[2:37:39] <McAngrimStein> Kiryu should always be stabbed, and whenever he's not being stabbed everyone should be asking, "Why isn't anyone stabbing Kiryu?"
[2:37:39] <+Xeno351> if you know who his is do you REALLY wanna fuck with him?
[2:37:40] <redial_nick> now it's personal not before NOW
[2:37:44] <shadespiral> How disappointed is everyone that Lo didn't get killed during that scene? E.g. sniped.
[2:37:45] <@SSaryn> Remember that cutscene in 2 with that dumb gold pyramid where you punch a tiger?
[2:37:45] <+zanzibar_junker> he was fighting in front of the Diet building in 3
[2:37:47] <$dmdyne99> WALK BY NEEDLE STABBINGS
[2:37:52] <%shiplord13> I killed him
[2:37:52] <%rdark_ksu> I mean with high stakes like you'd expect from yakuza there is a lot less murder than ya'd expect
[2:37:53] <Sulliman34> remember when the post credits stinger of Yakuza 3 is literally KIRYU BEING STABBED AND PRESUMED DEAD
[2:37:53] <Zombrocom> THe hobo was 2 yeah
[2:37:55] <%Kataguro> Eh?
[2:37:57] <mrblack499> Yes
[2:37:58] <%Spec7re> hes dead?!

[2:37:59] <+Th3SmartAlec> @mcangrimstein Majimas here for ya
[2:38:04] <%shiplord13> Presumably
[2:38:04] <hassanico> Onomichi no Himitsu
[2:38:05] <President_valentine> You won't
[2:38:06] <majindusto> Hobo Stabbed him in 2
[2:38:07] <Blank9> in 2 it was right before gold castle, with the good music
[2:38:07] <+Vikingdeath1> I just watched the Stabbing scene from 2 like, 2 days ago
[2:38:08] <Zebroneath> Why didn't he just turn himself in???
[2:38:10] <+ChestMimik> "Kiriyu did you kill Lo while we were drinking?"
[2:38:12] <ShichiNoBushi> Mama: "Kiryu, here's an invoice for the furniture you have obliterated over the last few weeks."
[2:38:16] <$El_Desperad0> What ever happened to Purgatory?
[2:38:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Dr_Mooose Apparently the people who start fights with kiryu are part of a hazing ritual with local gangs
[2:38:19] <jinking79> gets stabbed in the rain he did
[2:38:19] <Dest_121> near the bridge after karou finds about her family @AngriestPat
[2:38:19] <Sikelh> Nah he doesn't get stabbed because everyone KNOWS he's Kiryu. Only Majima's that crazy
[2:38:23] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat the hobo is in 2, in 3 it's a different asshole
[2:38:24] <QaizerArt> @ElenaManetta well you didn't wanna tag em, so i did
[2:38:26] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Remember, no koreans

[2:38:40] <McAngrimStein> They left the baby in the burning building
[2:38:41] <gunzerkingdunce> Is the audio behind?
[2:38:42] <masso101> It’s probably a dinosaur

[2:39:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> Really?
[2:39:42] <%ElenaManetta> I've only seen a bunny in the wild once. It was amazing
[2:39:42] <superraccoon9> atpRtsd

[2:39:47] <+Th3SmartAlec> Go home and be a family man!

[2:39:50] <ShichiNoBushi> "What's that factory over there?"
[2:39:51] <Conky89> You know what you say about rabbits...
[2:39:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> To be fair thats so stupid it could work
[2:39:55] <%ALTRNico> SECRET BUNNIES
[2:39:55] <gekizenbu> rabbit gas capitalism
[2:39:57] <DatAsuna> Pat, they literally have a nerve gas museum there
[2:39:59] <%nofestu2> wait Japan is revising it's history?
[2:40:01] <+Flambage> just ignore the big chemical facility over there
[2:40:03] <+TheImmortal70> What if the bunnies made that island
[2:40:04] <+Xeno351> revisionist history PogChamp
[2:40:06] <alwayspronking> BIO BUNNIES
[2:40:06] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @gunzerkingdunce Audio is synced fine for me, you might need to refresh.
[2:40:10] <+Brickston> @AngriestPat the secret being nerve gas would make WAY TOO MUCH SENSE for Yakuza. This is the series with RUBBER BULLETS. You gotta hit yourself a few times in the head
[2:40:11] <majima666> i've seen foxes in the wild. they make some freaky ass noises
[2:40:13] <+Flambage> The bunnies built the chemical facility @AngriestPat
[2:40:14] <%rdark_ksu> LIsten.....all i'm sayin is Unit 731
[2:40:16] <silverglove2012> cat island is the best island
[2:40:16] <lloyddboy> BIO GAS
[2:40:18] <+TheImmortal70> What if the bunnies experimented with the nerve gas and the HUMANS were the ones who stopped it
[2:40:19] <%Teintstein> the secret is that they're all secret bunnies
[2:40:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "logical"
[2:40:26] <Sikelh> Clearly the factory was built here to take advantage of the natural bunny population
[2:40:26] <masso101> What if the secret is mutant bunnies?
[2:40:27] <+Thunder_Poo> @AngriestPat playing video games with your nephew?
[2:40:30] <+BishopBain> LUL
[2:40:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> Thus we won't see Nerve Gas in this game
[2:40:32] <ItsZelus> PAT WAS IN YAKUZA 6 PogChamp
[2:40:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> But rubber bullets exist though
[2:40:36] <ToastedAeolo> does Yuta need another beatdown lol
[2:40:36] <%NovaKnightmare> they got the Philosopher's LEgacy
[2:40:37] <%GabeSweetMan> #truthrevealed

[2:40:39] <%Reizie_Etherealm> However, Yakuza isn't logical so there's that

[2:45:21] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat they arrested daigo in majima at the start of the game Pat
[2:45:24] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat Funny how Police are "cracking down" on crime but are only ever present to arrest Kiryu
[2:45:26] <majima666> most of the police are pussies lol
[2:45:26] <%Kataguro> Division 4, yeah
[2:45:27] <+TheEdrem> Yeah beat up those ganados
[2:45:30] <Sulliman34> you literally have a playable cop in your team in 4
[2:45:30] <%Zundelle> "Guys we need to send in a giant truck to run over kiryu, but we also need a dozen dudes on that truck in case he dodges the truck"
[2:45:31] <T_Sasquatch> truck of peace monkaS7
[2:45:34] <%GabeSweetMan> Pat, the police have more important matters to attend to. There are missing cats and 25 mph car accidents.
[2:45:35] <McAngrimStein> Imagine if you added another faction of the police to this story
[2:45:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat They threw kiryu at the problem
[2:45:41] <+Thunder_Poo> I remember pulling over a truck that was filled with a bunch of bad guys wearing suits.
[2:45:42] <hassanico> THAT FACE
[2:45:43] <+ChestMimik> @alexandrecau Capcom was serious about hitboxes I guess
[2:45:43] <masso101> Date might as well be the chief of police, he’s the only police officer left at this point
[2:45:43] <%Spec7re> Wow his face was fucked up
[2:45:44] <majima666> look at the guy you befriend in zero, the stop and search guy

[2:49:36] <%GabeSweetMan> LUL
[2:49:36] <masso101> It’s a yakuzies
[2:49:37] <+Brickston> Japanese ARPG
[2:49:37] <alexandrecau> by the way nagumo is getting mad
[2:49:40] <randomahole> JTA
[2:49:42] <+TheImmortal70> This is a Action game with Japanese Drama
[2:49:42] <Jetsfantasy> Immersive Beat-em-up
[2:49:42] <suikudo> Obviously this is a Japanese crime drama
[2:49:43] <+Th3SmartAlec> fuck off Nagumo
[2:49:44] <+linSP> its a PUZZLE game
[2:49:45] <SomersaultJustice> it's a beatem up
[2:49:45] <hassanico> You don't do any theft or grand auto!
[2:49:45] <%ElenaManetta> You ARE the car
[2:49:46] <+BoomerTiro> Well yeah, its' GTA in japan with no A to GT
[2:49:46] <Sulliman34> i actually had yakuza 3 sold to me as a kid as "yyakuza GTA"
[2:49:47] <Warbot40> Action JRPG is the closest descriptor
[2:49:47] <%shockzndrawe> You have different styles
[2:49:49] <%castcode> yakuzies the best
[2:49:50] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @commanderclaw That's a good one
[2:49:50] <+Menitta> RPG is more broad of a genre than Action adventure when you get down to it
[2:49:50] <%mayorrev> This is like smash bros, it's name is the genre
[2:49:50] <%shockzndrawe> you level them all upo
[2:49:53] <TheNocturnalScotsman> yakuza 5 is everything
[2:49:54] <%ItsRatman> Post-modern beat em up, okay?
[2:49:56] <Shastafield> putting cutscenes in a beat em up doesnt make it not a beat em up
[2:49:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's basically Metal Gear
[2:49:59] <Jetsfantasy> When's the microwave scene?
[2:49:59] <$Plutt_bug> Crazy Taxi
[2:50:00] <majima666> the car has no driveable cars. how is it a rip off of grand theft AUTOmobile
[2:50:02] <%shockzndrawe> It's a character action RPG
[2:50:05] <%torontototoro> The genre is nationalistic soap opera
[2:50:05] <+DukeMoose> Yakuza are OK FELLAS, as shown by this UNBIASED game
[2:50:06] <%iosephe> It's a Shenmue-like
[2:50:07] <%lmybestfriendl> Yakuza 5 is a smup
[2:50:09] <InugamiTheHound> yakuza 1 and 2 were billed at japanese GTA here in america.
[2:50:09] <majima666> the game*. hey its 5am here
[2:50:09] <%tigerfang86> ALL OF THEM
[2:50:09] <%MrSpaceLion> It's what David Cage has always wanted to make
[2:50:11] <+Thunder_Poo> I think this is a video game genres @AngriestPat
[2:50:12] <ZaibatsuFan> Serious! doodStare
[2:50:12] <+Menitta> Kuze has a heart of gold
[2:50:14] <ShichiNoBushi> Serious crime dramas with rogue phone AIs.
[2:50:14] <+Th3SmartAlec> Kiryu. Yakuza rules?
[2:50:15] <McAngrimStein> Anyone arguing about genre should watch Ardnut's video on genres, solves pretty much everything
[2:50:15] <Fujiwara_92> Yakuza = Metal Gear
[2:50:16] <%spiritofmojave> ESPECIALLY Beat
[2:50:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> Yakuza is yakuzalike!

[2:50:33] <%torontototoro> apatGib apatGib apatGib
[2:50:33] <%thenameisirrelevant> I would call it a SEGA arcade emulator with a story heavy game wrapped around it
[2:50:34] <$El_Desperad0> Isn't that the entire plot of the Uchiha clan?
[2:50:34] <CrowbarFacelift> Nagumo round 4
[2:50:35] <+Andu_in> one of the things that feels so off in this game, is how lifeless their eyes are, and most of their facial animations are very stiff
[2:50:36] <切捨御免> nagumo, you're still a fucking idiot
[2:50:36] <ToastedAeolo> I can't believe these guys think they can take Kiryu

[2:50:41] <+Brickston> HOT BLOODED
[2:50:42] <%theAncopro> ask him where the other cat locations are
[2:50:44] <Conky89> If these games were made by Hideo Kojima, the ratio would be 80% cutscene, 20% gameplay
[2:50:44] <%rdark_ksu> .....ok so thinking about cars... Does Kiryu have a drivers license?
[2:50:47] <hassanico> Nagumo is just Okuyasu but dumberer
[2:50:47] <%Spec7re> We need to kiss each other with our FISTS
[2:50:49] <%GabeSweetMan> LUL
[2:50:50] <42nfl19> you have to TALK with your FISTS
[2:50:50] <%Nobrev> time to kick the shit out of nagumo again
[2:50:50] <+DukeMoose> i like that subtitles country up and write in slang
[2:50:51] <%MrSpaceLion> character development
[2:50:51] <%Rngiddion> just back to back boss fights with the scrub crew
[2:50:52] <+ChestMimik> Real men talk through their fists
[2:50:54] <DeanX27> The cat is both in front and back LUL
[2:50:57] <ZaibatsuFan> Pat needs an Elmo jacket
[2:51:01] <+Brickston> @Conky89 oh so there'd be more gameplay?

[2:51:04] <%JackMillerTime> fighting to vent
[2:51:05] <%ALTRNico> NAGUMO BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[2:51:06] <%kewlmyc> He becomes Okyasu
[2:51:07] <alexandrecau> @rdark_ksu he is a taxi driver in 5 so no
[2:51:08] <Valentinius_Anodyne> He's basically a dumber Okuyasu
[2:51:09] <InugamiTheHound> remember when Kiryu punched Yuta in the face
[2:51:13] <hassanico> @Big_Dream ages ago, he finished Han with it
[2:51:15] <+Menitta> I still cant get over that baseball scene
[2:51:16] <%GabeSweetMan> Yo @ZaibatsuFan that's a strong idea.
[2:51:17] <Jetsfantasy> Watch Nagumo be secretly training all game
[2:51:23] <alexandrecau> oh brother

[2:51:37] <count_bob> I love him.
[2:51:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> I just want Majima to show up and grab nagumo and say "This is how you fight Kiryu chan!"
[2:51:40] <ZaibatsuFan> @GabeSweetMan Asap!!
[2:51:40] <count_bob> He's so dumb.
[2:51:41] <hassanico> I love his baby wind ups
[2:51:41] <DeanX27> Looked like you were going to play as Nagumo for a sec there
[2:51:42] <Sulliman34> hes just got THUG style
[2:51:49] <+TheImmortal70> Alright but you have to give it to Nagumo, he's the only guy who's felt what Kiryu can do multiple times, and STILL wants to believe he can beat your shit in
[2:51:52] <masso101> He’s doing his best though

[3:13:27] <Dr_Mooose> gotta earn that secret
[3:13:30] <OkamiDude15> the secret is the friends you made along the way @AngriestPat
[3:13:31] <+TheImmortal70> Oh no he's going to be so disappointed at how stupid it is
[3:13:33] <+ChestMimik> This secret better be stupid
[3:13:35] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat well maybe BECAUSE the code is 70 years old is why its so simple? 🤔 people probably werent creative back then
[3:13:35] <%ItsRatman> This is some serious padding right here
[3:13:35] <%GabeSweetMan> "Ash is a loser."
[3:13:36] <mr_ESB> Almost there
[3:13:37] <+Th3SmartAlec> top left?

[3:13:52] <TheNocturnalScotsman> here
[3:13:53] <+Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:13:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL One Piece is gonna suck
[3:13:53] <LandOfTheWay> DIG UP STUPID
[3:13:55] <%Niney_Who> It's ACTUAL TREASURE
[3:13:56] <%cvp5127> LUL
[3:13:57] <%Niney_Who> or a BIG WEAPON
[3:13:59] <%Josef_Stryker> LUL
[3:13:59] <dickbuttwoman> There's one in the middle exit on the main road
[3:13:59] <PeregrineWanderer> wait, why does the code to find any of this even exist if nobody is ever supposed to find the secret?
[3:14:00] <masso101> The secret is globgogabgalab
[3:14:01] <ShichiNoBushi> One Piece is a dress.
[3:14:02] <primarch_lupercal> It only seems simple in the context of the fact that your playing it. Its clearly not as simple as it looks
[3:14:03] <reonome> i don't even care about the one piece
[3:14:03] <+DesertOfSand> I'm a huge One Piece fan. I don't actually care what is at One Piece.
[3:14:03] <%tigerfang86> It's SUPER BIG something
[3:14:03] <%AbnormalVoid> IT'S GONNA BE A THING
[3:14:04] <Fujiwara_92> LUL
[3:14:05] <SixthSun2> IT's the secret of the Void Century
[3:14:06] <%Kataguro> It's a swimsuit for Nami
[3:14:07] <alexandrecau> @Williamld He has 20 secret agent in this town alone, Lo could have found it if he tried
[3:14:07] <%krispen_wa> The One Piece is the Patriots
[3:14:09] <+linSP> im waiting for one piece to end before getting into it
[3:14:09] <%GabeSweetMan> I hope the One Piece is just a big fuck off lump of gold.
[3:14:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I cant wait for One Piece to shit itself LUL
[3:14:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Assistants have come out and said what the One Piece is
[3:14:11] <+DashXero> Gary was right. Ash is a loser.
[3:14:11] <Warbot40> At this point, who cares what it is.
[3:14:12] <indig0bird> The One Piece apparently is fucking sick
[3:14:13] <%tigerfang86> ODA DOES IT AGAIN
[3:14:14] <%ItsRatman> I hope it's like, a fucking car or something
[3:14:15] <%Tearonex> It's going to be that fucking hat
[3:14:16] <CrowbarFacelift> THIS ROAD
[3:14:19] <InugamiTheHound> RIP Bleach
[3:14:19] <+AnIcedCoffee> Oda is an amazing mangaka
[3:14:20] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat It's Nude Pictures of Boa Hancock
[3:14:20] <indig0bird> And Whitebeard confirmed its existance
[3:14:20] <jorniev> ITS GONNA BE A WISH
[3:14:21] <gekizenbu> what if the One Piece is just a GUN
[3:14:21] <Monkeyweed21> Oda is the anti Araki Forgot
[3:14:21] <%shiplord13> Yeah
[3:14:22] <ssks123> i want it to be an entire island of treasure
[3:14:22] <CrowbarFacelift> hooray
[3:14:24] <$El_Desperad0> He only made 1 story though
[3:14:24] <alexandrecau> One piece is a huge boat
[3:14:25] <%Kataguro> Like Jaguar
[3:14:26] <%shiplord13> Wano is great
[3:14:26] <a_mad_dragon> the one piece is the secret history the world government erased
[3:14:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> I think One Piece is a massive chunk of gold that all melted together...In One Piece
[3:14:27] <masso101> The one piece is literally a single piece of gold
[3:14:27] <ssks123> like physically a treasure island
[3:14:29] <%LtShuckle> The one piece is gonna be something for each crew memeber
[3:14:31] <%Over_ninek> still ahvent even seen Vegapunk
[3:14:31] <Graywolf_the_45th> One piece is a single piece of gold but it's absolutely fucking massive
[3:14:31] <frogurtz> It's gonna be something so dumb
[3:14:32] <CrowbarFacelift> I think that's all
[3:14:36] <+Th3SmartAlec> YES
[3:14:36] <%NWR_James> The One Piece is some really sick cereal
[3:14:38] <%logoth_> We need to know about that smoking purple haired girl in the revolutionary army
[3:14:39] <+BoomerTiro> The One Piece can only be what everyone said it was from the beginning, the treasure which is a lot of stolen money
[3:14:40] <DRAGKUDO> game freezes
[3:14:41] <Captain_Krunk> There's too much for me to really care now. I stopped watching it a long time ago
[3:14:43] <+DukeMoose> you could saw one piece is similar to game of thrones
[3:14:44] <mr_ESB> Yaaaay
[3:14:44] <%rdark_ksu> I. Fucking. Detest. That. "it was the journey that mattered/ it was the friends we made along the way" i detest that shit
[3:14:44] <%thenameisirrelevant> Is one piece even worth getting into at this point
[3:14:44] <%Shadowthedigger> The one piece is probably going to be things that help all of them gain their life long dreams. Since it's established none of them give a shit about a monetary treasure.
[3:14:44] <televisedrevolting> The One Piece is actually a fucking EVA.
[3:14:46] <%Spec7re> Im convinced that part of one piece is a MASSIVE pile of treasure
[3:14:46] <KeiPrime> theres that once interview where one of his guys is like i think oda just likes drawing tiddie and oda is like NO SHIT idiot!
[3:14:47] <mistersups> We need to meet Vegapunk
[3:14:49] <%GabeSweetMan> I hope the One Piece is the island and the island just IS gold.
[3:14:49] <majindusto> SECRET TIME
[3:14:50] <Jetsfantasy> C'mon hard crash
[3:14:51] <TheNocturnalScotsman> it super was
[3:14:53] <redial_nick> the idea of the one piece is so insane people probably figured out already
[3:14:59] <+BishopBain> I feel like One Piece declined in quality after the timeskip. It's still good, but no longer great.
[3:15:01] <DRAGKUDO> swerved
[3:15:01] <%Niney_Who> I hope the One Piece is just a piece of God's skeleton
[3:15:02] <GeltonZ> I really don't CARE what the One Piece is. All I care about is seeing more Carrot and Nami...so for me the One Piece IS the Nakama we made along the way!
[3:15:03] <razgrizedge2> its big hats
[3:15:03] <+Demon_Reject> the One Piece is the mandate of heaven
[3:15:03] <+TheEdrem> One Piece should just be a magical mcguffin that enables NewGame+
[3:15:07] <%theAncopro> they did talk about having to basically rewrite the haikus to work in english
[3:15:08] <mrblack499> for love of god save it plz
[3:15:12] <mr_ESB> Lol
[3:15:12] <%tigerfang86> CRAZY TALK
[3:15:12] <InugamiTheHound> arabic numerals and english words
[3:15:13] <%Kataguro> CTA
[3:15:16] <Sonicdy> i think one piece just the ship
[3:15:18] <televisedrevolting> The One Piece is actually a really nice Hat.
[3:15:24] <ameraaaaaa> I'm back
[3:15:25] <colzack_> They actually mentioned on twitter that this game is the first time these poems have been translated so it was a good challenge
[3:15:26] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@aristomuse)
[3:15:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> I SOLVED THE PUZZLE
[3:15:27] <DRAGKUDO> close the door asshole
[3:15:29] <masso101> The one piece is the corpse of jesus
[3:15:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> One Piece would just be a golden straw hat
[3:15:31] <falconx9k> "Guys, there's ghosts."
[3:15:32] <%tigerfang86> THE FIELD

[3:15:41] <Jetsfantasy> 70 YEARS. Solved in 7 MINUTES
[3:15:42] <%NWR_James> You would not
[3:15:42] <frogurtz> The one piece will just turn out to be a tourist attraction and that the real one was stolen ages ago.
[3:15:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Nah you wouldnt
[3:15:49] <Monkeyweed21> it's REALLY DUMB
[3:15:49] <%theAncopro> it has be foreshadowed

[3:15:57] <OkamiDude15> @mistersups i thought vegapunk was the gas gang with that dude running tests on the giant babies
[3:15:58] <+lucaflow> no you wouldn't
[3:16:02] <Beefchief33> That's a surprise
[3:16:04] <KeiPrime> yeah
[3:16:07] <Monkeyweed21> it's SUPER DUB
[3:16:07] <Graywolf_the_45th> there's a very subtle hint about it but you would never see the connection until the reveal
[3:16:07] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat only way is if you recall one scene in moreno
[3:16:08] <+Th3SmartAlec> PIRATE GHOSTS
[3:16:09] <42nfl19> But Pat, maye its like hiragana where a symbols is a word or something
[3:16:09] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You can't, it isnt even a twist
[3:16:14] <Shinjiro120> There was foreshadowing in the beginning of the game
[3:16:15] <OkamiDude15> under water chinese ghost base

[3:16:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> it's a little obvious if you know some Japanese history, but overall it's not obvious.
[3:16:31] <%NopeBadguy> The poem stones are based on the ones in real life and have nothing to do with the secret. @AngriestPat

[3:49:05] <ameraaaaaa> the yamoto
[3:49:06] <%shiplord13> WHY
[3:49:07] <%zyberion626> You know America annihilated the first one because planes invalidate battleships right?
[3:49:07] <Daniel_Is_I> Why is a 70-year-old boat SECRET!?
[3:49:08] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's just a goddamned boat
[3:49:09] <Prism_Wing> Kenny was behind it all
[3:49:09] <JoshTheFace> mark 2 tho
[3:49:10] <%JackMillerTime> bigger Lo
[3:49:10] <@commanderclaw> Cause the Japanese love the Yamato, it's a big nerd out thing
[3:49:12] <%MrSpaceLion> @AngriestPat STOP THINKING ABOUT IT
[3:49:12] <%theAncopro> cause they KEPT it secret
[3:49:13] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Grayson_XLS) (warning)
[3:49:13] <Sulliman34> pat owning that thing is a fucking war crime
[3:49:17] <%Reizie_Etherealm> BOLD AND BRASH
[3:49:18] <%GabeSweetMan> I'm so happy this is the plot twist. It means less than NOTHING.
[3:49:19] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> This existing alone makes Japan fucked
[3:49:19] <Jetsfantasy> How is the baby connected to a secret warship?!
[3:49:20] <+BoomerTiro> It's a 70 year old international money laundering scheme
[3:49:21] <%Typhaeon> OK, nobody talked about this?
[3:49:21] <+DukeMoose> the TWOMATO owned by the yakuza ia going to invade manchuian russia again
[3:49:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat because they were under peace constrictions at the time
[3:49:22] <ShimmerFairy> The secret of Kenny.
[3:49:22] <%Kataguro> Kizno Ushiromiya
[3:49:25] <redsynod> *Battleships
[3:49:25] <Zebroneath> Is this a Japanese thing we don't understand?
[3:49:27] <+zanzibar_junker> breaking treaty?
[3:49:29] <%dheng1> War crime pat
[3:49:29] <CurrySauseBandit> Is Japan even allowed to have a warship like this?
[3:49:29] <worldbrand> this is like if area 51 was hiding a second statue of liberty
[3:49:29] <%Typhaeon> Nobody leaked for decades?
[3:49:30] <+bear_breaker20> cuz japan haz weapons and thats evol
[3:49:30] <a_mad_dragon> DAIDOJI
[3:49:32] <+yoshkosh20> asian george lucas. the true enemy
[3:49:33] <%shiplord13> Probably
[3:49:33] <%ThatGuyfromMars> it would've been declassified in like the 80s
[3:49:34] <sectorquack> its a war crime
[3:49:34] <King_Wolf_Rigger> DAIDOJI?
[3:49:37] <hassanico> THE ILLUMINATI
[3:49:38] <%brambobelurkin> DAIJOBU?
[3:49:38] <ameraaaaaa> i guess because your not allowed to have a battleship
[3:49:38] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat IF it was made after the war it would have been in violation of the peace treaty and technically a war crime.
[3:49:39] <alexandrecau> jingu 's dad
[3:49:40] <NeroInfinite> It would be naturally declassified at htis point yes
[3:49:41] <Marpolo13> BUT WHY
[3:49:42] <sectorquack> war crime and money laundering
[3:49:44] <dickbuttwoman> Money tho
[3:49:46] <x00Leon> the government do not want the yakuza to own a warship
[3:49:48] <Dest_121> War Crime @AngriestPat
[3:49:48] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Guys, the Yamato Mk II is the Japanese version of the Battlestar Galactica
[3:49:49] <%GabeSweetMan> Survival from WHAT?
[3:49:49] <%Shadowthedigger> The problem is big embezzling.
[3:49:50] <%shiplord13> Like this was literally 70 years it should be
[3:49:50] <T_Sasquatch> daidoji Kreygasm
[3:49:50] <bardofurbellum> THE WAR IS OVER
[3:49:50] <alrobot2014> @worldbrand but we already have multiple statues of liberty
[3:49:51] <gekizenbu> why is the Yamato 2 need for JAPAN'S SECURITY?
[3:49:51] <+twohitgood> japan isn't allowed to have a standing army
[3:49:52] <%NovaKnightmare> ok but why
[3:49:53] <%zyberion626> @angriestpat the Japanese have a hard-on for this fucking ship. It's fucking weird
[3:49:54] <%Mr_Pylon> So it's an embezelment scheme
[3:49:56] <+ChestMimik> Like it's a big deal but not "Kill hundreds in a conspoiracy" deal
[3:49:57] <+twohitgood> building a battle ship breaks that
[3:50:01] <alexandrecau> embezzled and chinese refugees
[3:50:01] <Daniel_Is_I> Necessary for survival, never used in 70 years
[3:50:01] <%Kataguro> It's a giant battleship. You shoot a cruise missile at it and it dies
[3:50:01] <%theAncopro> uncovering this affects a bunch of people that aren't us
[3:50:03] <worldbrand> @alrobot2014 yeah but this one's super illegal and built by immigrants
[3:50:04] <+Th3SmartAlec> more power
[3:50:05] <Shastafield> its outdated technology
[3:50:05] <+RevolverOcelot16> I understand nothing now
[3:50:05] <Daniel_Is_I> IT'S NOT A GUNDAM
[3:50:06] <%spiritofmojave> Ship existing now is a war crime no no
[3:50:06] <%Spec7re> This is the DUMBEST I love it
[3:50:07] <Madbearv> So when's Godzilla coming to fight Kyriu
[3:50:09] <+DukeMoose> but we even wink wink nudge nudge japan to have TOTALLY NOT aircraft carriers...
[3:50:10] <%JAVATOMICTWITCH> I'm seeing a lot of "but why" in the chat
[3:50:11] <%trillmagical> NotLikeThis
[3:50:11] <omen_setter> but the war's over guys
[3:50:12] <%Niney_Who> Because it's THE YAMATO
[3:50:12] <%Reizie_Etherealm> But battleships are OBSOLETE
[3:50:12] <dekkitout> So like that one joke in Archer where Ron stole the tank?
[3:50:14] <%NovaKnightmare> this is the most worthless project in the atomic age
[3:50:16] <dickbuttwoman> Cause then he could extort Daidoji more
[3:50:16] <%ThatGuyfromMars> but why
[3:50:16] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @AngriestPat It honestly is explained well why its important and a big fucking deal but its not important to Kiryu is the problem.
[3:50:16] <LtMckiller> yakuza is the best
[3:50:18] <Shastafield> LUL
[3:50:19] <Huntercd> Why!!!?
[3:50:20] <%dheng1> Here I thought it was a metal gear
[3:50:22] <redsynod> So haruka
[3:50:22] <%TheSniperJoe> Because he's a fucking SHIP Otaku.
[3:50:22] <KeiPrime> so the military was indebted to the yakuza
[3:50:23] <Xeno045> Also it was built with funds that were embezzled @AngriestPat
[3:50:23] <$MonsterEnvy> Cause blackmail and money
[3:50:23] <%JackMillerTime> what and let the military use it themselves
[3:50:24] <alrobot2014> @worldbrand but wasn't the first one built by the french?
[3:50:24] <+bear_breaker20> LMAOPat LUL
[3:50:30] <%NopeBadguy> It's blackmail
[3:50:32] <ghostravens> @Madbearv watch godzilla king of the monsters, i'm sure kiryu appears there
[3:50:33] <+SpectrumSpy> It's a fucking ship that's predecessor got TKO'd
[3:50:39] <Madbearv> Haha
[3:50:39] <King_Wolf_Rigger> We STILL occupy Japan though
[3:50:40] <+StrawberryPantsu> Wow that wasn't worth it
[3:50:41] <切捨御免> but there are literally still american bases
[3:50:41] <%Wallabri> like i understand why they... kept it secret but... what does it have to do with the story?
[3:50:41] <+StrawberryPantsu> At all
[3:50:42] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> it doesnt
[3:50:42] <%ThatGuyfromMars> is it a secret because they were fucking embarrassed they spent money on this stupid fucking boat
[3:50:43] <KeiPrime> the boat is LEVErage over him
[3:50:43] <Sulliman34> it doesnt, hiding the boat makes him money
[3:50:44] <切捨御免> ??????
[3:50:45] <%ItsRatman> So... this old man is still salty about WWII?
[3:50:45] <%shiplord13> Its been 70 years
[3:50:45] <hassanico> Pat is having a stroke
[3:50:47] <falconx9k> Kiryu's whole life is just stumbling into huge conspiracies
[3:50:47] <+BoomerTiro> The boat is physical evidence
[3:50:48] <worldbrand> @alrobot2014 yeah it was a gift, i just have nowhere else to run with this joke
[3:50:48] <+ChestMimik> This boat only exists to allow crimes to happen
[3:50:48] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> he has to keep it a secret
[3:50:48] <+notorious_rng> this is so far removed from haruka and haruto
[3:50:49] <count_bob> It's blackmail.
[3:50:49] <%Mr_Pylon> wats happenings
[3:50:50] <%NWR_James> The boat is a PROBLEM
[3:50:50] <%rdark_ksu> so many ppl would be needed in even building where you hide it. This is not a secret that could be kept
[3:50:51] <%zyberion626> You know all modern navies don't have battleships because they're worthless in modern naval combat
[3:50:52] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> its a leverage
[3:50:54] <Sulliman34> its BOATMAIL
[3:50:55] <%Agami23> how does the boat connect to the baby again?
[3:50:56] <%Niney_Who> Blackmail
[3:50:56] <dickbuttwoman> Cause then his career would be over
[3:50:57] <+zanzibar_junker> it helps kurusu
[3:50:57] <%Mornaka> @AngriestPat i think it's evidence of embezzlement?
[3:50:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat They were not supposed to build weapons during the occupation
[3:50:57] <%brambobelurkin> Thats what Im trying to figure out to
[3:50:59] <$MonsterEnvy> Blackmail
[3:51:00] <%NopeBadguy> The boat is physical evidence of his embezzlement
[3:51:00] <%JackMillerTime> its a good boat
[3:51:01] <%TheSniperJoe> Because he fucking loves boats, Jesus Pat what don't you get? LUL
[3:51:01] <prime_name> What does this have to do with Haruka?!
[3:51:02] <dickbuttwoman> It was Blackmail
[3:51:02] <%mh9s> why not just SCRAP IT
[3:51:03] <%spiritofmojave> the man just likes model boats, that's the secret :)
[3:51:03] <NeroInfinite> It was blackmail of the dumbest order
[3:51:04] <+Grayson_XLS> Okay, blackmail makes sense both thematically and narratively.
[3:51:05] <%Blackgaver> strong bullshit
[3:51:05] <%GabeSweetMan> @AngriestPat Incredible. We have now found the 2nd silliest scene involving the Yamato.
[3:51:06] <Daniel_Is_I> But isn't he dead??
[3:51:07] <LtMckiller> Kiryu is just a magnet for conspiracies
[3:51:07] <%NopeBadguy> @AngriestPat The boat is physical evidence of his embezzlement
[3:51:08] <@Fuggins4U> @AngriestPat The boat is proof he embezzled military funds.

[3:51:30] <Wan6Saber> bad writing?
[3:51:30] <%shiplord13> To invade China
[3:51:30] <%NopeBadguy> @AngriestPat Because he wasn't the one who had it, Iwami shipbuilding kept it

[3:51:44] <+StrawberryPantsu> But @AngriestPat MKII
[3:51:46] <%bread_assassin> I feel like Pat now is like Paige is when watching movies.
[3:51:48] <%torontototoro> TWOMATO
[3:51:49] <%Kataguro> It's physical proof the plot is stupid
[3:51:50] <Sulliman34> nothing at all
[3:51:51] <%MagickBurritoh> THE YOMEI WAS A COVERUP
[3:51:51] <%krispen_wa> Absolutely nothing
[3:51:52] <Daniel_Is_I> @Fuggins4U But you can hide it for 70 years??
[3:51:52] <+zanzibar_junker> big black mail
[3:51:52] <%MrSpaceLion> It's Mark II so clearly it's better than the original
[3:51:53] <%shiplord13> Literally
[3:51:55] <切捨御免> It's mark two, shut the fuck up
[3:51:56] <+Th3SmartAlec> NOTHING
[3:51:56] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Lets be real though, battleships are still powerful af and could do some serious damage.
[3:51:58] <%brambobelurkin> and they kept it lol
[3:51:59] <+DukeMoose> Battleship TWOMATO
[3:51:59] <LtMckiller> Kiryu is just there
[3:52:01] <$MonsterEnvy> Ot
[3:52:01] <dickbuttwoman> Nothing, kiryu is just a glitch in the system, man
[3:52:02] <%dheng1> Secret black project
[3:52:02] <+miguelrod777> nothing
[3:52:03] <Tucker0603> MARK 2
[3:52:04] <ameraaaaaa> so if they stop foundering the yukuza they will reveal it
[3:52:05] <$MonsterEnvy> It's 70 years old
[3:52:05] <Marpolo13> it's fucking OBSOLETE
[3:52:06] <%Mr_Pylon> WHY DOES THIS MATTER
[3:52:06] <+Grayson_XLS> It makes sense that so much was lost for a big stupid useless killing machine.
[3:52:07] <ameraaaaaa> yup
[3:52:08] <%shiplord13> Kiryu is the Yamato Mk 2's son
[3:52:08] <LtMckiller> He is literslly JUST there
[3:52:09] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat Haruka and yuta fucked on the mk 2
[3:52:10] <%Spec7re> 70 years later i dont think it would have the same effect on politicians
[3:52:10] <%Mornaka> JUST ADD MORE GUBS
[3:52:11] <worldbrand> I want this plot twist to show up in other games
[3:52:13] <Shastafield> LUL
[3:52:13] <+Th3SmartAlec> GODDAMN PAT
[3:52:14] <Sulliman34> what does it have to do with the BABY
[3:52:15] <%theAncopro> And Takeshi had to kill like hundreds for this boat secret
[3:52:17] <razgrizedge2> Two is bigger than one
[3:52:17] <%shiplord13> Makes sense
[3:52:19] <mrblack499> dying mans last wish,that's why
[3:52:20] <%MrSpaceLion> Kiryu is the pilot of the Mark II
[3:52:21] <redial_nick> you mean a flying boat?
[3:52:22] <omen_setter> Yamato Mark 2 is Haruto's dad
[3:52:23] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> The A-150 was a real design though
[3:52:23] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Safely wreck an entire city from behind the horizon
[3:52:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 80's
[3:52:28] <x00Leon> wheres the dragon of dojima mark 2?
[3:52:30] <@SSaryn> Kiryu just kidna went along for the ride so eh.
[3:52:32] <%Kataguro> This is like an American crime thriller having the Spruce Goose Mark 2 be the crux of the plan
[3:52:34] <$SGrim> @shiplord13 mother, father, or both.
[3:52:34] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat Ironically this was the same area where the nuke was dropped.
[3:52:38] <%GabeSweetMan> The purpose the Yamato II serves could just as easily be done by 4 gigs of CP.
[3:52:38] <+Th3SmartAlec> ALL ETERNITY
[3:52:40] <%MrSpaceLion> Kiryu is the 3rd child
[3:52:41] <Dr_Mooose> so take it apart?
[3:52:42] <dekkitout> I feel like this would be a scrapped plot point in Arpeggio of Blue Steel
[3:52:42] <Marpolo13> then why not SINK THE BOAT at that point
[3:52:42] <%Niney_Who> OOPS
[3:52:42] <OkamiDude15> so can someone tell what ANY OF THIS has to do with haruka and her baby? sfhTHINK
[3:52:43] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@JAVATOMICTWITCH) (warning)
[3:52:44] <%rdark_ksu> yea and no one is nothing a giant boat that just fucking popped up
[3:52:44] <%shiplord13> @SGrim All
[3:52:48] <Megapikman132> people HAVE DIED FOR THIS
[3:52:48] <%Kataguro> Why not just dismantle it?
[3:52:48] <omen_setter> Hirose killed countless people to hide this boat
[3:52:50] <%Mornaka> ONE LEVER
[3:52:51] <+ChestMimik> WHY
[3:52:52] <%MagickBurritoh> JUST KILL THE BOAT
[3:52:53] <+RevolverOcelot16> Who was drinking when they wrote this?
[3:52:53] <TheNocturnalScotsman> big fail on that
[3:52:54] <McAngrimStein> As far as plans go, it's a plan
[3:52:54] <JDebss> I feel like hiding that boat and building the thing that lowers and raises it would cost more than the boat
[3:52:54] <sponsoredviewer910> hide the boat for eternity
[3:52:55] <+DamnKrazy> Can't believe they named a ship after Vergil's sword Kappa.
[3:52:55] <%NWR_James> MONEY
[3:52:55] <prime_name> ETERNITY?!
[3:53:03] <Wan6Saber> @GabeSweetMan not in Japan, though athEZ
[3:53:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat pat this shows Japan broke international law building this. China blackmails the Yakuza and the yakuza blackmails the government
[3:53:05] <%MrSpaceLion> cause the Mark II
[3:53:06] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @OkamiDude15 Shh, don't worry about it tho
[3:53:09] <%GabeSweetMan> @Wan6Saber True.
[3:53:10] <Marpolo13> just get rid of the boat NotLikeThis
[3:53:11] <%ShogunNoonto> whats what the point
[3:53:12] <hassanico> @AngriestPat To keep getting his money
[3:53:14] <HeadsHeldHigh> cause you know....mark 2 though...
[3:53:14] <+StrawberryPantsu> BUT PAT MK2
[3:53:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Why wouldn't they call it something something else? Battleships were named after rivers in in the IJN. Did it HAVE to be Yamato?
[3:53:17] <+Grayson_XLS> Is he still alive after that beating?
[3:53:18] <dickbuttwoman> More money, pat
[3:53:19] <$SGrim> @shiplord13 Kancolle taught me about futa Yamatos self-impregnating. I can dig it! rooPog
[3:53:21] <%JAVATOMICTWITCH> how do you hide a boat that big for 70 YEARS?
[3:53:22] <%rdark_ksu> also why has he not stood up
[3:53:22] <+DashXero> "The money was good."
[3:53:22] <%shiplord13> Good question
[3:53:23] <+ChestMimik> Hirose is still alive?
[3:53:24] <%MrSpaceLion> the Mark II
[3:53:26] <%theAncopro> And now Hirose is gonnas be all FATHERR
[3:53:26] <dan_g_v> so how is the race war going so far. are we winning?
[3:53:27] <%dheng1> Pat mk2 man
[3:53:27] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat He still HAD the boat. That's all the leverage he needs
[3:53:27] <%TheSniperJoe> I don't get how you're not getting this.
[3:53:30] <%Kirby_Sauce> Because HONOR
[3:53:32] <$El_Desperad0> Why is he still on the ground?
[3:53:33] <$MonsterEnvy> He's not he decided to just kill everyone who knew instead of the boat
[3:53:34] <%shiplord13> Okay
[3:53:35] <%spiritofmojave> must've been some good dosh
[3:53:38] <%TheSniperJoe> Boats are so fucking cool Pat, why don't you understand? LUL
[3:53:38] <gl0vesup7> Hirose is just chilling on the floor
[3:53:38] <%JAVATOMICTWITCH> but how
[3:53:38] <+StrawberryPantsu> Pat you dont understand
[3:53:38] <Yadogari> YEAH NUKES
[3:53:38] <%ECRead> what part of Mk II are you not understanding?
[3:53:38] <%shiplord13> Go ahead
[3:53:39] <%ShogunNoonto> its not even a good ship anymore
[3:53:40] <x00Leon> so the yakuza can take over america
[3:53:40] <%dheng1> Because big boat
[3:53:41] <+StrawberryPantsu> MKII
[3:53:42] <%GabeSweetMan> Well now we know why he was so non-chalant about getting beat down. It didn't matter.
[3:53:42] <+DukeMoose> oh no
[3:53:42] <reonome> NUKES
[3:53:46] <+Grayson_XLS> It was America's fault.
[3:53:47] <hassanico> baby Beat!
[3:53:47] <%MrSpaceLion> it's the Mark II
[3:53:47] <sectorquack> WHAT THE FUCK
[3:53:48] <KhonsuII> But what does it do in Trickster?
[3:53:48] <+DukeMoose> they modeled him as a kid
[3:53:49] <切捨御免> It was all the nukes fault
[3:53:50] <OkamiDude15> @El_Desperad0 he's all tuckered out
[3:53:50] <%NopeBadguy> @AngriestPat Because he still had the physical evidence and he probably still has documents, but you're right, he did kill all his witnesses LUL
[3:53:51] <JittersCaffeine> What a freeze frame
[3:53:52] <Bouldus> woooo street gangs
[3:53:53] <shadespiral> There's still more information you don't know.
[3:53:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> PAT FFS
[3:53:55] <%JAVATOMICTWITCH> I don't even care about why I'm just baffled as to how now
[3:53:55] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I refuse to believe this guy is in his 80d
[3:53:58] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @AngriestPat They're planning to sell it for unlimited yakuza money at some kind of nouveau riche auction so Yomei alliance can buy all of Japan at once
[3:54:00] <colzack_> So he would be the only one that knew about it
[3:54:01] <+DukeMoose> lil' takeshi
[3:54:02] <%MightyMaxT> You keep it as blackmail but make sure no one else knows about it. Seems simple to me
[3:54:03] <%FrostMass22> Is this antagonist Japanese Kenny?
[3:54:03] <%MrSpaceLion> for the 3rd impact
[3:54:04] <%NopeBadguy> @AngriestPat Well, I guess if push came to shove, he could get Hirose to act as a witness
[3:54:05] <%TheNewJapanGuy> @Pat it was basically a deterrent from the fallout of WWII, it should have been another nuke that failed to detonate in Hiroshima.
[3:54:05] <Admiral_PopnFresh> wait he was 14 in 1945? HOW OLD IS BEAT TAKESHI!?!
[3:54:06] <%dheng1> Because secret pat
[3:54:08] <+DesertOfSand> Wouldn't it make more sense to just remove the boat instead of removing everybody who knew about the boat?
[3:54:09] <hassanico> @ThatGuyfromMars i think he's 94
[3:54:11] <$MonsterEnvy> Cause Daidoji wanted no lose ends
[3:54:11] <uberhox> is this a sub story?
[3:54:14] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat Because those people could talk. Iwami is the only one who knows, the only one to blackmail
[3:54:16] <%shiplord13> Why not scrap the boat
[3:54:17] <$MonsterEnvy> and Kurusu agreed
[3:54:17] <%crimsonharvest> sounds like that other guy was the leader
[3:54:19] <Angry_Ev1L> THis is LITERALLY Gundam Unicron story
[3:54:20] <ProfBadger> Bwecause at this point, it's more a liablility than an asset?
[3:54:21] <lloyddboy> Vending Machines
[3:54:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Pat are you pretending to not understand?
[3:54:23] <%Typhaeon> But VENDING MACHINES

[3:54:23] <worldbrand> But then... vending machines
[3:54:23] <thewhiterice92> @uberhox NAH BRO this is what the plot was building towards
[3:54:24] <razgrizedge2> its a very cool boat
[3:54:25] <%LuckyLagomorph> @AngriestPat So that he would be the only one who could use the boat for blackmail.
[3:54:26] <%rdark_ksu> oh come on
[3:54:28] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Takeshi's like in his 70s get outta here
[3:54:29] <+Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[3:54:30] <JoshTheFace> LUL LUL LUL
[3:54:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> So he could continue to be the sole person profiting from blackmail
[3:54:32] <Shastafield> COULDNT say no
[3:54:32] <rumuloh> Why would youwant to be the only one with the big secret, makes no sense at all, so hard to get
[3:54:33] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat exactly if only you and the guy you blackmaill know about the boat, you get all the money
[3:54:33] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:54:33] <Ion_Laser> :D
[3:54:34] <JittersCaffeine> That was one smooth transition

[3:54:35] <worldbrand> It's not a sub story, it's a battleship story

[3:57:20] <Marpolo13> YAKUZA IS KIWAMI
[3:57:26] <%crimsonharvest> this shit is why i hate the FF14 villains, they're useless
[3:57:27] <Sulliman34> its literally not that complicated. he was hired to keep the boat secret and used it to blackmail the government who knew about it. if the boat was ever revealed it would be considered a UN war crime of harboring weapons of war
[3:57:28] <Balay123> Why does that dude look like Shinji
[3:57:30] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @dekkitout no it just doesn't make any fucking sense

[4:02:44] <Yadogari> The SECRET mark 2
[4:02:47] <%Kataguro> Why don't you just scrap it you stupid idiot?

[4:03:48] <%JAVATOMICTWITCH> this happens every time I watch Yakuza gameplay, I'm baffled by the craziness, then I'm absorbed as fuck and zone out of the commentary lol
[4:03:54] <hassanico> @crimsonharvest he thinks of him as his dad too
[4:03:54] <%vergil_angelo> @crimsonharvest That’s why they are patriarchs
[4:03:55] <%Blackgaver> it involves some bullshit that makes no sens
[4:03:55] <%MrSpaceLion> it's not the Mark II
[4:03:56] <Huntercd> I am getting more confused watching this @AngriestPat
[4:03:57] <+ahegotrigger> fuck I missed Pat witnessing the Secret
[4:03:57] <%ThatGuyfromMars> the secret is a fucking boat!
[4:03:58] <PeregrineWanderer> i still do not remotely understand why, if the secret was so important, there was a code leading to it in the first place
[4:03:59] <%vergil_angelo> It’s a crime family
[4:04:01] <+Th3SmartAlec> MAMORU
[4:04:01] <+MastodonSentry> ITS A BAOT

[4:04:47] <JittersCaffeine> Was the REAL Yakuza the friends we made along the way?

[4:04:50] <%MrSpaceLion> what if the One Piece is the Mark II?
[4:04:52] <+Th3SmartAlec> but...what. about that Secret Mk III?
[4:04:53] <%Blackgaver> @alexandrecau oh

[4:05:04] <%Blackgaver> B-BOSS
[4:05:06] <+DukeMoose> OH NO, what if the one piece is just a ship
[4:05:06] <MrSxtet> Or it's friendship, either or
[4:05:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> I bet the real secret of One Piece is that it doesn't exist.
[4:05:12] <Angry_Ev1L> THe secret was friends we made along the way

[4:29:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I was disappointed
[4:30:04] <%bluetocho13> okay who ever came up with CT MKII is a genius
[4:30:23] <%Kataguro> So is the Sub just going to be full of Mk II jokes for the next few days or so?
[4:30:24] <+Th3SmartAlec> @kataguro it's so on the nose, and he must have bought it right after telling Iwata-man
[4:30:26] <gypsystranger> the pirate ghosts actually takeover the Yamamoto mk2 if you finish their side quest
[4:30:46] <gypsystranger> it's not on the nose it's up it
[4:30:56] <+Th3SmartAlec> @gypsystranger an Outer Heaven Mk II for the Pirate Ghosts
[4:30:59] <BappoSama> Goodnight gang
[4:31:00] <ShinobiPhoenix> I was not disappointed, by SexWolfPatch
[4:31:24] <BappoSama> Oh man, it was a boat..
[4:31:34] <+Th3SmartAlec> @shinobiphoenix he showed up at a really opportune time too
[4:31:37] <majindusto> BIG BOAT
[4:31:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the real diamond dogs were Beat Takeshi's droopy eyes
[4:31:41] <%ALTRNico> it was a mk 2 boat
[4:31:41] <%bluetocho13> no it was the MKII
[4:31:47] <Chuckgofer2> I've played maybe 20 minutes of Yakuza Kiwami, I'm going to be so lost for the next week or so. Maybe I'll get lucky and Randy Pitchford will do more stupid shit
[4:31:53] <+Th3SmartAlec> I can't believe Vergil was hiding the secret the whole time
[4:31:56] <gypsystranger> *BIG BOAT MK2
[4:32:01] <%nofestu2> it was the second boat of its boat kind
[4:32:12] <ShinobiPhoenix> EyePatchWolf and Pokémon Direct, so much to look forward to
[4:32:18] <%bluetocho13> right Vergil knew too
[4:32:22] <majindusto> Kiryu Beat Takeshi's Challenge
[4:32:34] <+Th3SmartAlec> @gypsystranger you are beyond even Big Boat. we shall call you Big Boat Mk II
[4:32:35] <gypsystranger> yo if I was president I would totally name the next aircraft carrier or whatever the Vergil mk2
[4:33:12] <+Th3SmartAlec> @gypsystranger ...where's Mk I?
[4:33:17] <lloyddboy> WHO STABBED OUR BlO-DADS?
[4:33:20] <+Menitta> did the secret happen
[4:33:25] <Yadogari> Yeah it happened
[4:33:26] <gypsystranger> shut up that's where
[4:33:31] <%bluetocho13> no one say shit
[4:33:34] <%spiritofmojave> it sure did happen
[4:33:38] <+Menitta> damn i missed it
[4:33:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Menitta yes
[4:33:40] <+Th3SmartAlec> @menitta the secret happened, and the secret Mk II happened
[4:33:41] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 Pat, being near death makes revenge EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. Anyway, I'm drawing a disturbing parallels between this plot and the Old Ones lore in 40k a bunch of powerful old dudes(old ones) create an organization to protect them and their stuff ( (kr)orks) and it eventually backfires and their creations start taking them out, or as TTS put it "subjected all old people to summery executions". They also parallel with the c'tan, due to infighting to consolidate power
[4:33:42] <%Kirby_Sauce> reward A Cheer shared Rewards to 10 others in Chat!
[4:33:55] <emillionghost> i missed the secret cause i went to get food
[4:34:02] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> twas a boat
[4:34:06] <+Th3SmartAlec> @menitta oh man, you're gonna want to watch the VOD
[4:34:09] <%ItsRatman> mark twooooo
[4:34:10] <gypsystranger> *mk2
[4:34:10] <%Kataguro> The Battleship Yamato Mk II
[4:34:12] <%bluetocho13> the secret is super important
[4:34:14] <%Kirby_Sauce> @emillionghost BOAT MK2
[4:34:15] <%Kataguro> That's the secret
[4:34:18] <+Menitta> BECAUSE ITS DUMB
[4:34:25] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> a big ol boat
[4:34:25] <ShinobiPhoenix> I know this twist sounded stupid, but let's remember that in real life, the President of the United States made the military hide a boat from his sight because it was named after the guy who didn't pick his boots
[4:34:27] <+megalons> does anyone know the name of this song/beat?
[4:34:28] <+Menitta> and I REALLY wanna see his reaction
[4:34:31] <emillionghost> @Kirby_Sauce boat. GOT IT. thank u sweetness
[4:34:32] <+Th3SmartAlec> @menitta BUT MK II THO
[4:34:35] <gl0vesup7> Hirose is The Old Hunter confirmed
[4:34:36] <gypsystranger> guys dont you get 2 is bigger than 1
[4:34:41] <gypsystranger> MARK 2
[4:34:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its dumb but it makes a weird kinds sense...
[4:34:46] <shadespiral> @ShinobiPhoenix Which president?
[4:34:47] <%spiritofmojave> Secret MK2 > Logical Plot Line
[4:34:49] <+Th3SmartAlec> 2 > 1
[4:34:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> That's my secret, Kiryu. I'm always a boat MK II
[4:34:53] <ShimmerFairy> It's almost as cool as the Mark 3
[4:35:03] <%Kataguro> It makes sense, but it being the crux of this entire story is beyond ridiculous
[4:35:11] <gypsystranger> spoilers for yakuza 7
[4:35:13] <+Th3SmartAlec> @spiritofmojave what fucking series do you think this is?!
[4:35:14] <ShinobiPhoenix> The one we didn't actually vote for, but Russia did
[4:35:17] <gypsystranger> it's the mark 3
[4:35:26] <%bluetocho13> I don't get it tho why does it have to be a secret
[4:35:34] <%Kataguro> I hope we get to dismantle the boat in the final battle with Iwata
[4:35:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> War Crimes
[4:35:44] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> This wouldve been a good yakuza addition but not Kiryus closing game
[4:35:47] <ShinobiPhoenix> So people are petty and stupid by video game levels now in real
[4:35:50] <gypsystranger> the boat is the final boss
[4:35:50] <%AnIcedCoffee> AnIcedCoffee subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:35:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @bluetocho13 They build it during a period of time when they were not supposed to have a navy
[4:35:54] <%spiritofmojave> @th3smartalec I'm not saying it has genius writing before this, look at Kiwami 1 or 3 lmao
[4:35:56] <%Niney_Who> @bluetocho13 Japan was dematerialized after WW2 so it was not allowed by the UN for them to make warships
[4:35:56] <+Th3SmartAlec> @bluetocho13 it'd ruin like 2 people's careers if it were discovered, this everyone has to die
[4:35:58] <Yadogari> I can't wait for Kiryu to fight Kiryu Mk. II for the final fight
[4:35:58] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Like this feels like yakuza filler
[4:35:59] <lloyddboy> @bluetocho13 BIG political corruption
[4:36:00] <%ElenaManetta> AHH
[4:36:03] <%Niney_Who> PATTT
[4:36:07] <%Kirby_Sauce> I want Kiryu to go out like Geralt did
[4:36:08] <+Th3SmartAlec> Yeahhh
[4:36:09] <%Niney_Who> You let him escape without playing VIRTUA FIGHTER
[4:36:09] <Astaroth130> good
[4:36:10] <%Kataguro> Sleepy
[4:36:11] <%CarrowayFashonti> Are you okay Pat?
[4:36:11] <%Niney_Who> He RAN AGAIN
[4:36:11] <@commanderclaw> JAPAN
[4:36:12] <shadespiral> @bluetocho13 Japan was supposed to give up their military stuff but they decided to hide the boat and keep working on it anyway.
[4:36:14] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@StrawberryPantsu)
