[0:13:15] <Darren716> This is the Pat stares at content i come here for
[0:13:17] <$Piemono> The season where they made a video with his child son telling him how proud he was of him was the roughest
[0:13:18] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt The best one is when his kid made an emotional tribute to him, and he started crying, followed by his kid saying "Tanaka, Thai Kicku"
[0:13:18] <Darren716> Like legit
[0:13:19] <%necrocannibal2> Japanese TV is hardcore

[0:22:29] <%Typhaeon> You aren't OCP, Gamestop.
[0:22:30] <whisperstatic> the company is about to go bankrupt, the reason they're being such assholes about keeping the stores open is they don't have the cash neccessary to shut down for a couple of weeks
[0:22:30] <Yummy_Nukes> at least we can pray to doomguy and his eternal rage
[0:22:33] <%necrocannibal2> managers are such cucks

[0:23:03] <NickCaesar7> @patstaresat that's exactly why the governor of Pennsylvania clarified his order as mandating non life necessary retail

[0:36:14] <%PipIV> I was tearing up before and now I'm a little annoyed thinking about the pretend now
[0:36:15] <%trustycoyote> @PatStaresAt My first job was at a pawn shop and I have no story that tops that shit

[0:36:21] <hzealot> @patstaresat she's that one guy from stardust crusaders with the sports car
[0:36:24] <bettysharkface> @TheBitingIrish We kicked them out but there was nothing we could do, the cops no longer respond to calls from our store due to all the meth heads
[0:36:24] <heartlesshealer> they don't put the photo up in case they actually do lose home thanks to crimes
[0:36:29] <%BuoyantSoul> @AbysmalWulf free money

[0:36:43] <troxvon_the_lesser> @PatStaresAt do you have shit kid stories from retail?
[0:36:43] <%IMDRanged> Expect to be shot
[0:36:44] <%42nfl19> a credit card or a government "stamps" card? Stamps were replaced with "debit" cards I think @PatStaresAt
[0:36:45] <EuropanLamprey> Or people who have seen Pawn Stars
[0:36:45] <%ssjklyco> People at pawn shop know they are shady to be fair
[0:36:47] <%StaceMcGate> or drug-addicts fencing
[0:36:48] <whisperstatic> looking for a fence
[0:36:48] <misterspotswood> @PatStaresAt we have one too, she hangs out at the grocery store then walks home to her apartment a couple blocks down
[0:36:48] <Fien111> I went from a inner city store with homeless and theives to an rich retirement community with old, angry rich folks. Rich folks are 10 times worse
[0:36:49] <%YakumoYomi> You don't ask questions at the Pawn Shop
[0:36:50] <Daebunz> im glad that while my job is retail its a nice LGS that has been around for 40 years. so its only a little fucked, sometimes
[0:36:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "I have these 20 phones, that are all mine, I swear."
[0:36:59] <+ktothec99> Drug addicts selling things to buy drugs
[0:37:00] <augusta_wind> i've never seen a pawn shop and i almost don't believe they exist
[0:37:03] <%ElkRiverDog> One of those dudes in my hood gets in his $30,000 car that he parks behind him to have lunch breaks

[0:37:21] <SparkAfterDark> Pawn shop is a step above grocery. Desperate in pawnshop is trying to get money. Desperate in grocery is "couldn't get money, stealing food now"

[0:38:55] <Fien111> Actually the worst stores are the one that are like a block from a highschool. Kids will come in and rob you blind DAILY and you can't do shit. If you so much as touch them you're gonna get sued by shitty parents that don't care that their kids stole 500 bucks in shit
[0:38:56] <augusta_wind> you know what they won't shut down? waste management
[0:38:57] <%YakumoYomi> TP is now a premium currency
[0:38:57] <%PipIV> revolution? no?
[0:38:59] <+neeto_makar> Retail workers right now wake up early, go deal with a stampede of desperate people, then go home and see / kill their parents. @PatStaresAt
[0:38:59] <+ktothec99> Also shit is stressful right now and they dont get a day off even

[0:47:54] <%maskofmichael> Gun Ghost
[0:47:56] <%NovaKnightmare> Did Pat intentionally pick the guy based on Doomguy?
[0:47:56] <%42nfl19> This was originally shown off as an apple mobile game
[0:47:57] <Monkeyweed21> A jump is just a vertical dodge roll
[0:47:57] <%ryome> BIG TENTACLE!
[0:47:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> turn down a smidge
[0:47:58] <%StaceMcGate> game too loud

[0:48:43] <%xsnowfox> DELIVERY
[0:48:48] <%D00msDayDan> yo did i just hear beatdown in there?
[0:48:52] <+Pookiedaexzile> So is Doom Slayer gonna fight angels or what
[0:49:00] <%croxeye> bruh
[0:49:01] <fabo_joyful> Oh, this is super crate box
[0:49:02] <+Pookiedaexzile> or or like are the angels aliens
[0:49:02] <%D00msDayDan> great now i have homestuck music stuck in my head
[0:49:08] <+lethallylactic> I don't like the "random gun" aspect. That was fun as an optional mode/challenge in Enter the Gungeon, but here...I'm not a fan.
[0:49:12] <%dalmek> it was on Apple Arcade
[0:49:14] <%코코꾸라> Yeah, Apple Arcade
[0:49:14] <%californaya> yeah, Apple Arcade
[0:49:15] <%croxeye> yeah the apple arcade game
[0:49:16] <+neeto_makar> Apple arcade yeah
[0:49:22] <WarchiefGoldva> The 4th Horseman sounds like absolute shit. Like a gun sneezing.
[0:49:22] <benjiFG> would you play enter the gungeon as an off-stream?
[0:49:24] <lloyddboy> YO
[0:49:25] <%NovaKnightmare> BASED
[0:49:26] <%necrocannibal2> I'm getting Cave Story vibes for some reason
[0:49:26] <Saltmeisterr> ye
[0:49:30] <%xsnowfox> awww cute
[0:49:32] <SparkAfterDark> last bullet in the clip does more damage
[0:49:32] <Fro5tburn> omega bullets PogChamp
[0:49:33] <+MrFalco> i like to imagine, since this is almost just an asset flip mobile game, we can expect a real Gungeon 2 eventually
[0:49:37] <warmnoid> GUNGEAR
[0:49:41] <+TOONFOOD> it's like a fancy super crate box
[0:49:41] <%Erimos> Last bullet is stronger.
[0:49:42] <%JuliusGemstone> more damage on the last clip
[0:49:42] <RyuuAoi> Looks dope! Contra-ish
[0:49:45] <%Piemen99> nice
[0:49:49] <+Pookiedaexzile> Wait I just looked it up on the wicky....yo guess what the new enmies in Doom are called
[0:49:53] <%Louie_Salmon> @mrfalco Oh yeah, no doubt
[0:49:58] <%Manjove> i want doom now though!!!!
[0:50:00] <%Masutasodo> You can also do the roll mid-jump I believe in this
[0:50:01] <%xsnowfox> remote controlled
[0:50:05] <misterspotswood> >clip
[0:50:08] <%Louie_Salmon> @pookiedaexzile Hornybois
[0:50:08] <PKHTjim> Nikita?
[0:50:15] <+Pookiedaexzile> The Maykers
[0:50:18] <+Pookiedaexzile> Get it
[0:50:22] <%hmgirlpopuri> Is it really two ways to dodge though? You could move in 360 degrees in gungeon but had to dodge roll to dodge vertically
[0:50:23] <Dova573> This is Enter the Gungeon METAL SLUG edition
[0:50:40] <dapperskeleton69> GO BANANAS
[0:50:41] <+Pookiedaexzile> Genius Kojimbo punched up the doom script
[0:50:46] <%hmgirlpopuri> Seems more like the dodge jump replaces your dodge roll in anything but a strictly horizontal dodge
[0:50:47] <dapperskeleton69> B A N A N A S
[0:50:49] <MrDonTacos_> PogChamp 👉 🍌

[0:56:08] <rbakervv> @butthurtdave the game calls it a rising dodge-roll
[0:56:10] <%Jekado> @tusk102 thats the game
[0:56:11] <MattDemers> @tusk102 I imagine because you don't get ammo back.
[0:56:15] <+theman515> theman515 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 6 month streak! DOOOOMMMM

[0:57:30] <weirdducks> yeah the new guys in this are BRUTAL
[0:57:30] <heartlesshealer> gave it a good go with the b u l l e t _

[0:57:42] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> What the fuck is that purple thing
[0:57:47] <jobbedbone> FOR BABIES
[0:57:48] <%SkyPirateArcane> Oooh the newest CoD was only 35 bucks, so now I can hit it with DOOM tomorrow
[0:57:53] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Baby the Gungeon
[0:57:54] <FaytxStay> Metal Slug 6
[0:57:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> don't you guys have phones
[0:58:01] <%Louie_Salmon> I hope the sequel to gungeon has a mode like this
[0:58:02] <+Voldra> Its like Enter the Gungeon and Gunstar Heroes had a baby
[0:58:04] <Badgerconda_> a little gungeon. as a treat.
[0:58:07] <butthurtdave> yeah this looks like it'd be hard to control with a touch screen
[0:58:07] <hntronium> touchpad
[0:58:09] <MiskatonicAlum> with a BT connected controller
[0:58:09] <rufus2k2> was it mobile or apple arcade?
[0:58:10] <+Pookiedaexzile> touch controller
[0:58:11] <dekkitout> Gungeon *Low Caliber Edition*
[0:58:12] <TheNumberJay42> touch controls are so bad
[0:58:12] <EuropanLamprey> Angriest Pat wouldn't degrade himself by streaming a mobile game
[0:58:12] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> Oh shit this is on mobile?
[0:58:14] <PKHTjim> YES, Gunstar Heroes.
[0:58:17] <tusk102> the button is just on the screen
[0:58:17] <rufus2k2> is apple arcade mobile?
[0:58:18] <augusta_wind> use ur mind powers
[0:58:19] <troxvon_the_lesser> I have never been able to get to the 3 level of gungoen
[0:58:19] <+MrFalco> it's not bad all things considered, can't imagine it in it's original format as mobile though.
[0:58:20] <%TIME_PUNCHER> NL asked the same question
[0:58:23] <sunsetserenity1> You can use controllers on iPhone and ipad
[0:58:23] <+theman515> get one of those //GAMING// cell phones
[0:58:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> @skypiratearcane the newest CoD is a free to play battle Royale game.
[0:58:30] <rosemon5001> you would do much better whit a mouse
[0:58:43] <%Louie_Salmon> Notice the totally empty left and right sides of the screen? That's where the transparent D-pad and buttons go
[0:58:44] <%SkyPirateArcane> I mean the campaign and all of the addons
[0:58:47] <Monkeyweed21> Did you ever beat the Lich @PatStaresAt ?
[0:58:48] <Saltmeisterr> shit now I wanna play gungeon
[0:58:51] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> heh, Pat's a bottom.
[0:59:01] <%Louie_Salmon> Well, except in these rooms, then it would be in the way
[0:59:02] <Saltmeisterr> lich is a piss easy baby
[0:59:09] <%mankeyfigh> @patstaresat Game apparently has shit support on mobile
[0:59:15] <+Pookiedaexzile> I mean pat doesn't have a choice,he's short, he's always on bottom
[0:59:16] <butthurtdave> How does getting guns work, it looks like the game's just randomly giving you them on a whim
[0:59:18] <%SkyPirateArcane> This looks nuts
[0:59:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> CoD has single player? Ew.
[0:59:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> rogue legacy, it's in the name
[0:59:34] <Saltmeisterr> @butthurtdave its like blessed mode
[0:59:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> Hades and Hades.
[0:59:36] <%Louie_Salmon> StS though
[0:59:37] <%코코꾸라> No Isaac?
[0:59:37] <%californaya> SLAY THE SPIRE
[0:59:37] <Daxalog> "Lites" Yes Im that asshole
[0:59:39] <PKHTjim> Into The Breach was good.
[0:59:39] <heartlesshealer> Hades deserves to be there
[0:59:40] <%Agami23> world of horror?
[0:59:41] <%kyh9> downwell is pretty good
[0:59:41] <+thackattack00> Dead Cells tho
[0:59:41] <Xeno351> Slay the spire
[0:59:41] <%Rngiddion> and dead cells
[0:59:42] <+TheGrumpyDumps> Dead Cells?
[0:59:44] <%KishinGrek> Is this dlc all platform based?
[0:59:44] <DHBoi> Dead cells?
[0:59:44] <rufus2k2> RogueLITES anyway
[0:59:46] <tusk102> slay the spire though
[0:59:47] <FeelsBadPat> ??????
[0:59:48] <+TopTieramisu> spelunky
[0:59:50] <%kknutson4> Slay the Spire
[0:59:50] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> wow, get fucked Dead Cells
[0:59:50] <rosemon5001> anyone here since the start how much i have missed characters he used?
[0:59:50] <jobbedbone> only if you're bad
[0:59:51] <%QuadraticGravity> World of Horror?
[0:59:51] <+Saggitori> spelunky 2
[0:59:51] <dapperskeleton69> dead cells???
[0:59:52] <ShineTheDiamond> Hades is fun
[0:59:52] <heartlesshealer> Slay the Spire is good, but it's not new
[0:59:52] <DrFacilier> has a great story tho
[0:59:52] <Monkeyweed21> SLAY THE SPIRE AND DEAD CELLS
[0:59:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> Isaac is old AF too
[0:59:54] <Mechazoic_Era> too many items in isaac
[0:59:56] <+theman515> It's old too, starting to show it's age
[0:59:56] <+HeathCottengim> into the breach tho
[0:59:56] <FeelsBadPat> but thats wrong though
[0:59:56] <%SkyPirateArcane> Hades is great. WoH is too if you consider it a rougelike
[0:59:56] <heartlesshealer> excluding new character
[0:59:57] <+metalsiren31> Dead Cells though pvpWhy
[0:59:58] <%Bt_Robot> So Dead Cells, then?
[0:59:59] <Lutre> it is impossible to go back to isaac after gungeon
[0:59:59] <krin_x> rogue legacy
[1:00:01] <%Agami23> nuclear throne is good, but needs more content
[1:00:01] <%californaya> I got tired of Dead Cells really fast. Not sure why, it's pretty fun to play.
[1:00:02] <bear_breaker20> lmao dead cells
[1:00:02] <%mankeyfigh> Wow just fuck the rest HUH
[1:00:03] <%hmgirlpopuri> @PatStaresAt Is Oregon Trail a Rogue-like?
[1:00:04] <butthurtdave> I love Spire, but I still haven't BEATEN beaten it yet
[1:00:07] <Samaugsch2> Is world of horror worth $20 in its current state?
[1:00:08] <warmnoid> i hate how isaac has a bajillion items but hardly explains what they do
[1:00:08] <%Keyd00d> what
[1:00:09] <FeelsBadPat> what?
[1:00:12] <jobbedbone> its not that hard just put in 200 hours
[1:00:13] <Dova573> I wish dead cells felt more like Bloodstained
[1:00:16] <+thackattack00> dead cells
[1:00:17] <Darren716> Pat youre nuts
[1:00:19] <%Louie_Salmon> Well yeah, just play it for a decade silly
[1:00:20] <Monkeyweed21> Dead cells tho
[1:00:20] <srkAres> it really doesnt
[1:00:25] <+TopTieramisu> Curse of the Dead Gods
[1:00:26] <%BestTeaMaker> @PatStaresAt honestly, there are so many amazing roguelites/likes atm that you can have favorites of any of them. My personal go-to atm is Slay the Spire.
[1:00:27] <%KishinGrek> For replayability?
[1:00:28] <heartlesshealer> moonscraper gun
[1:00:28] <krin_x> world of horror is great
[1:00:32] <Monkeyweed21> Slay the Spire too
[1:00:34] <%Louie_Salmon> It wouldn't be complicated at all if you played it for a decade
[1:00:34] <WarchiefGoldva> I don't know about that one, chief. I think Isaac plays like shit because the controls are atrocious.
[1:00:34] <%mankeyfigh> Dead Cells?
[1:00:35] <austinj24> Theres a new megaman battle network style roguelike dropping soon
[1:00:35] <SparkAfterDark> You're not wrong, but also keep in mind that there are whole swathes of the roguelite genre that you hate, like card games and the like
[1:00:38] <$spardanwarrior> Once you learn how to use your momentum to angle your shots Isaac feels MUCH better.
[1:00:38] <heartlesshealer> A koto?
[1:00:39] <Lutre> it's not the complexity that fucks isaac, it's the shitty movement + shooting
[1:00:41] <%Radeson> I think Isaac is better cause it's less depth than gungeon lol
[1:00:45] <benjiFG> did you ever beat the rat in gungeon
[1:00:45] <%Keyd00d> I need to go back to StS and play the 4th
[1:00:46] <Monkeyweed21> KUNG FU HUSTLE GUN
[1:00:46] <SwindlerOfProgress> I don't really like Dead Cells, either
[1:00:47] <%Agami23> slay the spire is pat kyrptonite, but is also good
[1:00:48] <%kknutson4> Slay the Spire and FTL are my jam
[1:00:48] <%kyh9> It's that weapon from Kung Fu Hustle
[1:00:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> @samaugsch2 it's much more worth subscribing to Xbox Game Pass PC and getting it for free.
[1:00:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @warmnoid I like it, though I go into it with more of an arcadey mentality and don't expect to beat it
[1:00:55] <%SilvaChariot0133> NAIIILL GUN!!!!!
[1:00:59] <%SeventyForce> Is that chinese harp thing?
[1:01:00] <butthurtdave> Are there still synergies?
[1:01:01] <+Goshism> Pat ever play streets of rogue?
[1:01:01] <tusk102> @warmnoid the games refusal to just say "here is the effect" and instead giving vague little joke descriptions on most items is so bad
[1:01:05] <EuropanLamprey> It's Gael's fucking machine gun crossbow
[1:01:07] <nuane> nail gun more like fail gun
[1:01:07] <%KishinGrek> LAZER
[1:01:12] <FeelsBadPat> its like the people who say they wont watch one piece cuz its too long, its nonsense
[1:01:12] <RushUnplugged> as someone who still loves Dead Cells, it feels extremely shallow and those time-gated doors force a speedrun mentality that isn't always the best
[1:01:18] <Ultimatefool> Is this room based, not floor-based like Gungeon original?
[1:01:20] <%mankeyfigh> I love how Pat changes his mind so quickly
[1:01:25] <+Pookiedaexzile> I think Imma steal this guys random weapon power for a thing
[1:01:31] <troxvon_the_lesser> I just sort of overtime learned all the shit in Issac so I honestly find it really fun to play when I'm bored or have like 45 mins to an hour to burn.
[1:01:36] <lloyddboy> temp powerup

[1:03:28] <tusk102> @EuropanLamprey i meant to say read a VOLUME
[1:03:31] <dekkitout> A shotgun that shoots hate seems like a Destiny gun
[1:03:35] <tusk102> @EuropanLamprey but i fucked up
[1:03:37] <SparkAfterDark> >more than a chapter a day
[1:03:38] <+HyperCharge_Sam> I remember watching One Piece Toonami and them being stuck in the desert for like 100 episodes and stopped caring
[1:03:43] <HungryHungryEmu> One piece is crazy after fishman island
[1:03:44] <dapperskeleton69> SAA
[1:03:44] <%SkyPirateArcane> I wish I liked One Piece, but I just can't get into the art
[1:03:46] <troxvon_the_lesser> I feel like gungeon is way stupid hard
[1:03:48] <jobbedbone> How far do I have to go into gintama before its good? I always quit
[1:03:49] <%GrayMatterMiner> GrayMatterMiner subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! God dammit. Doom Eternal and animal crossing same weekend. I can hear my wallet crying in the corner. It begs for mercy, but I have none to give. F in the chat for wallet
[1:03:50] <+mechslayer71> Bet he never unlocked the gunslinger. Scrub LUL
[1:03:50] <Monkeyweed21> you would remember that dude is cray
[1:03:52] <%ClericOfSparda> psaDab_LH

[1:03:59] <%ClericOfSparda> psaDab_LH psaDab_LH psaDab_LH psaDab_LH
[1:04:06] <%MayorRev> @patstaresat did you beat the first game as Gunslinger?
[1:04:08] <+TopTieramisu> read the manga
[1:04:10] <Xeno351> oh, that's not a glitch
[1:04:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @SkyPirateArcane I feel the same about Full Metal Alchemist. Something about the rounded square faces
[1:04:17] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt favorite gun in gungeon?
[1:04:23] <+Pookiedaexzile> Glitch lich is being stolen
[1:04:27] <RushUnplugged> OP gets good at page 1 and yall are just cowards
[1:04:27] <WarchiefGoldva> Yo I'm tired as fuck, gonna go crash. See you in the VOD, Pat.
[1:04:36] <%MayorRev> Gunslinger is fuckin busted
[1:04:41] <%MayorRev> I love him
[1:04:42] <ketchuo13> Gunslinger is like easy mode with his passive item
[1:04:45] <%SkyPirateArcane> @Sphincter_Spelunker I can totally see that, the art in that is a bit weird comparatively to other things
[1:04:45] <SparkAfterDark> The lead maiden was always the fucking worst to fight
[1:04:49] <Monkeyweed21> BTW Catch up with Jojolion shits getting CRAZY
[1:04:49] <tusk102> @RushUnplugged ur right and you should say it
[1:04:55] <%QuadraticGravity> Always having every synergy active
[1:04:57] <Mechazoic_Era> always have a synergy
[1:04:59] <Monkeyweed21> EVERY SYNERGY EVER
[1:04:59] <benjiFG> @PatStaresAt all guns have their synergies
[1:05:00] <+TopTieramisu> gunsling creates automatic synergies
[1:05:01] <troxvon_the_lesser> Is that a shotgun shell that fires whole shotguns?
[1:05:02] <%dalmek> every gun has all synergies active
[1:05:02] <tusk102> @Monkeyweed21 finally after a decade lol
[1:05:03] <oAznoUta> automatic synergies
[1:05:03] <cardboardboots> gunslingers passive was all synergies
[1:05:08] <%Louie_Salmon> That's busted
[1:05:14] <%Louie_Salmon> That's actually insane
[1:05:15] <%MayorRev> he always has a synergy when picking up a new gun
[1:05:16] <+mechslayer71> All synergies in guns automatically
[1:05:16] <benjiFG> cactus Kreygasm
[1:05:20] <%MayorRev> it's epic
[1:05:27] <SparkAfterDark> it's not even really a game mode so much as it is a viewing mode for what synergies there are and what it's like to use them
[1:05:30] <cardboardboots> its great to see all those rare synergies
[1:05:34] <EuropanLamprey> I dare anyone to read this months Jojolion chapter and tell me there's no main villian

[1:08:20] <PKHTjim> The minecart Gunstar Heroes level.
[1:08:20] <SparkAfterDark> So it seems like the jump and the dodge are both good for different things. The jump is good, but since it physically takes you upward, there's a limit to how much you should use it. The roll is less overall dodge, but also doesn't cost you upward movement
[1:08:24] <+Voldra> @MiskatonicAlum Yes!
[1:08:24] <%MayorRev> @patstaresat all stones that orbit you can also block bullets
[1:08:25] <+mechslayer71> @troxvon_the_lesser I’ll take it

[1:25:50] <+jcenderion> I saw the thing come out a few times
[1:25:50] <%Derbisol> the amp
[1:25:52] <%QuadraticGravity> I saw you drop an amp while you were holding it
[1:25:53] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> woooo

[1:26:04] <%Tyndarian> just reload...
[1:26:05] <%mankeyfigh> Can I enter, then exit, then enter, then exit, then enter REALLY hard?
[1:26:05] <%Derbisol> it comes out on auto reload
[1:26:06] <eureka60> lets fill 20 minutes by talking about facemelter
[1:26:07] <VritraReiRei> i saw you drop the amp but not sure what you did
[1:26:08] <+MrFalco> it's there, but you'll be lucky if it lasts more than 2 seconds

[1:26:09] <collind99> Does anyone know if I can get a pretty good gaming PC for under $1000 or is that goal unrealistic?
[1:26:11] <%Akanesasusora> it looks like it just randomly drops amps, instead of dropping on reload
