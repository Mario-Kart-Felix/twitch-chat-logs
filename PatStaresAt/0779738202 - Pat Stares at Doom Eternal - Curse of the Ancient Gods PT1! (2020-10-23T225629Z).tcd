[0:24:16] <%DedlokPM> @marvel877 I don't think he was the one that made the decision to change Stadia Creative Director for SG&E Creative Director. Also having it as Stadia Creative Director made so many people think he was the actual Stadia guy instead of a game studio that Google bought

[0:38:44] <valriot> Probably cos Doom has skeletons and you cant say Taiwan
[0:38:45] <%Bailey__gaming> did they say why.
[0:38:49] <%Buzzard42> what difficulty is pat playing on?
[0:38:53] <%RageCasanova> or is this some dora the explora level shid
[0:38:56] <%MyBulletsLAG> MyBulletsLAG subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! I see Hutchinson's dumb take like this: imagine having to pay id Software/Bethesda every time you wore a Doom shirt, that you bought, in public where other people could see it. Also how long before baby zangief learns the piledriver?
[0:39:02] <+Javaa01> For now
[0:39:05] <%AzureGale> @Tuna_Can_0 Press the chainsaw button four times at the runes screen and DOOG ETERNAL popped up
[0:39:12] <Saltmeisterr> what does the life rune do?

[0:40:01] <@SoFarFetched> "The DOOG easter egg has been removed, but will live on in infamy… We were wondering how long it would take for someone to notice, and as always, we're impressed with the community's speed!"
[0:40:05] <%realm_forge> @blivru it takes a 12 pack min for me cuz I’m a TANK
[0:40:06] <peachy996> Like a dark souls but on a time limit
[0:40:10] <%Buzzard42> it's HUGE
[0:40:14] <+KidsSeeGh0sts> the game is like 6 hours long and has 3 levels
[0:40:25] <peachy996> But I dont see it being useful if anything more than fodder kills you
[0:40:27] <T_Sasquatch> i dont know what it is about golry kills but I still just hate them , even if they're less than 3 seconds
[0:40:29] <%Bailey__gaming> hello paige

[0:47:59] <%oniwahoo> I hope there will be a possessed marauder in the near future

[0:48:16] <Aydarkzero> please do
[0:48:17] <%Buzzard42> no
[0:48:17] <peachy996> So I like that they force you to use Microwave Beam now. Presumably to spite you

[0:49:13] <%Mopper_Rod> This is that quality content that drives subscriptions.
[0:49:17] <%ElkRiverDog> Luigi’s Haunted Mansion?
[0:49:22] <+Nomenanza> @peachy996 some speedrunners used microwave beam in short burst to stunlock an enemy, the game just poorly expalins how microwave works
[0:49:29] <TheAngryArtist> so the first thing you think of when you see a beam of energy killing a ghost is luigis mansion?
[0:49:40] <%TheREALGirthMan> You can see the gears turning in his goblin head
[0:49:41] <+SnakesFunBox> Luigis House on a haunted hill
[0:49:42] <%Issun135> ^
[0:49:45] <TheAngryArtist> not... ghostbusters?
[0:49:57] <%UvBenServed> Heh

[0:50:56] <%oniwahoo> Circle strafing?! Nah, the only honorable form of combat is to stand in front of each other trading blows
[0:51:00] <Aydarkzero> i think Pat is tired
[0:51:02] <%AzureGale> Can you imagine a spirit-buffed empowered demon
[0:51:06] <TheAmazingClaytor> Luigis big vroom room
[0:51:06] <Zooperton> vocabulary regressing
[0:51:07] <%SirKeigan> Okay now you're just making noises lol
[0:51:09] <suikudo> An empowered spirit possesing a hell knight DarkMode
[0:51:11] <+Javaa01> It's good for chump enemies, but once you get hit by a cyberdemon, it becomes less good
[0:51:16] <%DappercatEsquire> Pat turning mouth marbles into miracles
[0:51:19] <+Pyroclase> Invisible doomguys.

[0:52:15] <Aydarkzero> look at this video game
[0:52:17] <%코코꾸라> LONG MEATBALL CHAIN
[0:52:17] <+Pyroclase> Eternal is clearly trying to make a statement that dumb video game shit is okay to use if it's fun
[0:52:21] <+griffball13> the piller by the mario 3 spinners
[0:52:25] <%Cozy90> did paige almost die?

[0:52:52] <Estel013> wall climb spot?
[0:52:53] <TheAmazingClaytor> @Chester_goes_Berserk so basically "Doom in smash when"
[0:52:53] <+griffball13> @PatStaresAt the pille by the mario 3 spinners
[0:52:56] <Aydarkzero> is the classic Doom Guy outfit your favorite?
[0:53:00] <%oniwahoo> What is the practical application of thew things? Like what Demon went "spinning fire things that can be stepped over will stop people"?
[0:53:05] <%SirKeigan> yup
[0:53:06] <%AzureGale> HAVE CONFIDENCE
[0:53:12] <+Pyroclase> What a detailed bridge collaspe
[0:53:15] <%dj_xo98> Pat you were literally standing on it but refused to look at it
[0:53:19] <%Cozy90> NO CONFIDANCE
[0:53:27] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> @TheAmazingClaytor Doom guy in smash is also acceptable
[0:53:29] <%Buzzard42> LUL
[0:53:34] <Estel013> COMPIDANCE
[0:53:35] <%oniwahoo> Is that the King Seeker?
[0:53:37] <+punklogan> Coulda been worse, coulda said boners incoming
[0:53:51] <TheAmazingClaytor> Compidance - MISSILES INCOMING
[0:53:55] <%walternatorz> I'm afraid how Pat would talk about his child if he were to have one.
[0:53:55] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> MISSILE MISSILE MISSILE PULL UP PULL UP PULL UP
[0:54:05] <%TakingLifesL> "missiles incoming" because you mentioned a red rocket?
[0:54:09] <T_Sasquatch> This game aesthetically is so weird , I don't know if it wants to be colorful or metal
[0:54:11] <ScreamLord> That's why I prefer to get female dogs
[0:54:14] <Estel013> When Zangief gets hold of you in SF, you know a boner is incoming
[0:54:21] <Huntercd> Doog
[0:54:29] <%Finakala> Ayy, just beat this level
[0:54:44] <%realm_forge> Pat has to really search to find the asshole

[0:57:50] <+griffball13> bloodpunch is the pinky weakness
[0:57:52] <%NovaKnightmare> I love this video game
[0:57:56] <%Buzzard42> you aren't DONE
[0:57:59] <Aydarkzero> @MyNameIsRasus just hoarding them
[0:58:10] <black_pariah> how much damn health did that arachnotron have geez
[0:58:21] <%Finakala> '0/2 trials cleared' Oh shit you're in for a time
[0:58:24] <%Calek> nice to see the left path is just as full of crap as the right path
[0:58:24] <%Mopper_Rod> I think some people complained that the regular game was too easy or something.
[0:58:26] <%Buzzard42> the spirits have a TON of health
[0:58:27] <HyMyNameIsMatt> Throwing a doom slayer into this fight is hilarious
[0:58:28] <T_Sasquatch> rip and tear , as the kids would say
[0:58:35] <MyNameIsRasus> @Aydarkzero i meant getting them back after dying
[0:58:53] <+OmegaWeltall> i hate thosse assholes wth the shields
[0:59:07] <$RealThiele> Arachnotrons seem to have significant projectile damage reduction, but splodes usually do ok
[0:59:13] <%Buzzard42> low visibility monster closet is a good one
[0:59:13] <%Finakala> The two trials took up about 2/3 of my gametime in this level so I'm gonna enjoy watching Pat
[0:59:23] <+unclekulikov> Egg
[0:59:38] <+titansloth93> you know it's stressful when you sigh like you just took a massive shit
[0:59:40] <+Javaa01> It's a timer, duh
[0:59:42] <%Finakala> Forward then backwards, Pat
[0:59:42] <+Pyroclase> it opens a grate across the gap
[0:59:42] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> it's a fuckin' emu
[0:59:49] <jellssssss20> It showed you
[0:59:53] <%Mopper_Rod> It just showed you a cutscene to show you, didn't it?
[1:00:00] <%Calek> I tried for an hour and a half to beat the trial in the right path, I couldn't do it
[1:00:07] <+Pyroclase> it opened the grate you just jumped through
[1:00:16] <+unclekulikov> hitting that button repairs the Vectron VII
[1:00:25] <whitebatsy> It opened the gate you jus tjumped through, it literally showed you in a cutscene
[1:00:27] <%Mopper_Rod> You have bumblefucked your way to the correct answer.
[1:00:28] <%Finakala> I think the right path is harder slightly? They're both pretty tough

[1:04:09] <peachy996> Mostly due to that foggy swamp
[1:04:13] <%Finakala> This route I found harder, but the final arena slightly easier
[1:04:13] <%AncelDeLambert> yes, taht is the interface
[1:04:15] <%Buzzard42> there's a path
[1:04:17] <KeystoneA2> swim

[1:04:29] <%Mopper_Rod> Normally I just skip forward through parts where you or Max or Woolie get stomped by Doom for a while, but there's something soothing about the exasperation and chaos of this DLC.
[1:04:34] <%DakotaMacDoodle> @PatStaresAt Pro Tip: Shoot the Cyber Demon until it Dies
[1:04:36] <%realm_forge> ...don’t phrase it like that pat

For me it was Spiritfarer.
[1:07:52] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Hey, shouldn't you be paying Bethesda for a license so you can stream this? I'm so smart...
[1:07:58] <Aydarkzero> The Father wanted to take a nap

[1:28:58] <%realm_forge> Whoever designed these levels wanted to see the world burn
[1:29:00] <%Buzzard42> TWO OF THEM
[1:29:01] <%Finakala> Wondering where it was
[1:29:06] <zargy> "Mom, can we have Master Levels?" "We have master levels at home."
[1:29:08] <Joeggernaut777> @SvenHolgersson He's too focused to recognize that cigar burn you gave him
[1:29:11] <Aydarkzero> life get
[1:29:12] <OverlordedK> lucky that's it's never the baron that gets the final hit lol
[1:29:15] <%Finakala> Thankfully only one is possessed
[1:29:16] <Josef_Stryker> The support rune is so good
[1:29:20] <%Mopper_Rod> These ghosts are a problem.
[1:29:20] <+Thelovelybison> man you're lucky it wasn't the possessed that killed you
[1:29:25] <+Pyroclase> this is JUST fodder demoins kicking your ass, by the way
[1:29:26] <Josef_Stryker> Except for when a Mega Demon has the life
[1:29:29] <%Buzzard42> well, not getting that one back
[1:29:30] <%Finakala> Fucking clutch
[1:29:31] <%Buzzard42> oh jk

[1:29:48] <%Buzzard42> get fucked
[1:29:53] <%realm_forge> YEAAAAH ROUND 2 BITCH
[1:29:58] <negrosnake9185> Oof
[1:30:05] <Josef_Stryker> That's why u beeline it for the Spirit
[1:30:05] <+BotanicMoney> Once more
[1:30:06] <%Mopper_Rod> Imagine if he didn't have that rune.
[1:30:06] <OverlordedK> I went out of my way to kill the other so it wouldn't get possessed lol
[1:30:07] <+Pyroclase> make damn sure you don't run out of plasma ammo
[1:30:08] <$ringabal> YOU DIDNT WIN
[1:30:08] <Josef_Stryker> Those guys are fuckers
[1:30:16] <TheAngryArtist> i lived, bitch
[1:30:22] <Josef_Stryker> God imagine how Woolie is gonna do in this DLC
[1:30:29] <Josef_Stryker> Because eventually he will play it
[1:30:30] <+Nomenanza> the worst feeling is killing a possessed one but NOT having enough plasma to cook the ghost
[1:30:32] <Ipsenscastle> holy crap I actually wouldn't be able to cope with this constant pressure at all
[1:30:32] <%Buzzard42> woolie is going to coward out
[1:30:34] <+Zeromaru2> That Spirit is a bitch
[1:30:35] <%Finakala> I'm waiting for Calli
[1:30:40] <%Calek> Woolie will be playing on normal
[1:30:41] <+botchdogg> seeing this is making me regret not using that rune lol
[1:30:48] <thelonechris> I feel like those spirits were put in for the purpose of making people use the ghostbuster attachment
[1:30:54] <%devanmuse> yeesh, so long as a jobber gets the killing blow, you have virtually endless extra lives
[1:30:55] <%AzureGale> Pump the demons full with your bullets
[1:30:58] <%YakumoYomi> Did Woolie play on Ultra Violence too>\
[1:31:01] <Joeggernaut777> That soudns like a good idea
[1:31:11] <%Calek> that extra life perk is carrying this LP
[1:31:13] <peachy996> Nah Woolie was on Normal
[1:31:22] <BurdRightsActivist> TWO LIVES LUL
[1:31:25] <BurdRightsActivist> THREE OMEGALUL
[1:31:26] <+Pyroclase> oh man
[1:31:28] <+HostilePoundcakes> uh oh
[1:31:29] <%realm_forge> you really have to play the long game with possessed high tier enemies
[1:31:29] <peachy996> Its rightfully carrying this level
[1:31:30] <taro_m> the shield on the minigun is pretty effective at preventing the damage from barons
[1:31:32] <Josef_Stryker> Is Pat playing on Ultra-Violence?
[1:31:32] <%Buzzard42> LUL
[1:31:34] <OverlordedK> two lives from that one solider lol
[1:31:36] <%Finakala> This arena has no checkpoints either, so without this rune you'd be screwed
[1:31:38] <+Pyroclase> that's the trick, lose one while trying to get the other
[1:31:41] <%Valdorick> Stumboing kinda hard
[1:31:46] <buglynug> suck the juice
[1:31:49] <+Nomenanza> you can use microwave to microstun a possessed demon Pat
[1:31:51] <Joeggernaut777> Escape Pat your life is in peril
[1:31:58] <+Nomenanza> if you need a breathing room
[1:32:05] <%YakumoYomi> Demons be like: "Why are you running? WHY ARE YOU RUNNING?!"
[1:32:15] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> limesS
[1:32:16] <peachy996> good jerb
[1:32:18] <Make_me_mad> Alright, now spirit tyrant.
[1:32:22] <OverlordedK> man I should of got that extra life rune lol
[1:32:24] <%Valdorick> You
[1:32:25] <%Valdorick> did it
[1:32:30] <Ipsenscastle> fuck me this is just too much
[1:32:34] <%JD_Lars> And that was the easier one
[1:32:36] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> god i remember when "sus" meant something that could be perceived as gay
[1:32:38] <Josef_Stryker> Might as well be done
[1:32:43] <KeystoneA2> @PatStaresAt Just think, you still have another one of these to do on the other path brucegLaugh
[1:32:44] <%Mopper_Rod> I expect 3 more phases now.
[1:32:46] <%Finakala> Congrats you beat the easier room
[1:32:51] <thelonechris> 1 more to go LUL
[1:32:53] <Ipsenscastle> well done Pat
[1:32:56] <+BotanicMoney> That extra life runs does wonders
[1:32:56] <BurdRightsActivist> @SaltkeyAndAckfish that's pretty sus
[1:32:58] <$RealThiele> killing all the heavys that are not possesed seems very important
[1:32:59] <$ringabal> Pat truly is the big strong

Btw, I turn 30 next month, what is your sagely advice for the next decade? Lastly, thanks for the compliment! It made me feel like the bad bitch I should be.
[2:15:08] <%realm_forge> THERE IS NO GOD HERE
[2:15:13] <MasterTonberry23> @TheBitingIrish i think so, youre better off swapping him out for Marle or Ayla Kappa

[2:16:10] <%TheActuallyGuyR7> lol. i watched a guy do this level on nightmare this morning. wait till he sees wave 2.
[2:16:11] <geassguy360> Its ok Whiplashes took their place
[2:16:18] <%Taisuru> Doom Guy wanted to become Moon Guy for a second there
[2:16:18] <%코코꾸라> THE PLAN IS SIMPLE
[2:16:35] <%DedlokPM> WE KILL THE BATMAN!
[2:16:35] <geassguy360> cant bust turret on possessed
[2:16:37] <OverlordedK> that's sure what I do
[2:16:48] <%UvBenServed> Alternatively, BFG
[2:16:51] <$ringabal> YA JUST GOTTA HAVE SOME GODDAM FAITH
[2:16:57] <+Javaa01> A nice plan in concept, but the devs thought of it first
[2:16:59] <%Finakala> Possessed zombies are fine tho
[2:17:15] <JustYudha> BFG is easy mode tho
[2:17:17] <geassguy360> both options are viable really depends on the fight/luck
[2:17:26] <+TheBitingIrish> Wouldn't call Arachnatrons super-heavy but w/e
[2:17:29] <%Calek> possessed demons are no joke
[2:17:41] <%1matheuw> why tho?
[2:17:44] <Make_me_mad> The full auto shotgun still seems like garbage.
[2:17:46] <%Finakala> The increased fire rate makes possesssed Arachnos really quite dangerous
[2:17:55] <%SirKeigan> The music chord progression sounds like the title music to 28 days later bass line
[2:18:06] <$Mopopolis> RIP
[2:18:07] <%1matheuw> ded
[2:18:08] <OverlordedK> oof
[2:18:09] <KeystoneA2> F
[2:18:11] <CoffeeSlice> ooph
[2:18:12] <geassguy360> yeah chainsaw gives health when yer hurting

[2:18:12] <valriot> LUL
[2:18:13] <Zooperton> F
[2:18:13] <peachy996> See that fire?
[2:18:18] <+Pyroclase> This is the exact point I turned down my difficulty
[2:18:18] <Yummy_Nukes> LUL
[2:18:18] <%realm_forge> YEAAAAAH
[2:18:22] <puse9> never stop moving
[2:18:26] <%Valdorick> RIP
[2:18:27] <geassguy360> ouch
[2:18:28] <%Finakala> I did both these arenas without lives, yeah, they'll fuck ya
[2:18:32] <KaiserMario> HAH I knew it, don't underestimate the small fry
[2:18:37] <%realm_forge> Now do it all over again
[2:18:38] <%TheActuallyGuyR7> this is the easy part of the arena though.
[2:18:42] <mesamus> use your freeze grenades man
[2:18:44] <%Finakala> He's not even seen the worst part of this yet
[2:19:01] <+TheBitingIrish> So they nerfed Chrono but didn't buff autoshotty or microwave?
[2:19:13] <+johnny_gogo> What does he think of the new music?
[2:19:17] <peachy996> I love the full auto Shotgun despite how little use you have for it
[2:19:18] <%realm_forge> @finakala hehehehe
[2:19:19] <%1matheuw> even in the main game pat can either use the regular nades or the frost ones he can never use both
[2:19:36] <+Javaa01> This DLC's favorite trick is misdirection, because people get insane tunnel vision playing these types of arenas every time a big enemy shows up
[2:19:43] <%AzureGale> Chicken noodle soup kicks ass man
[2:19:47] <%mike2hands> PAT
[2:19:49] <%SirKeigan> Dude
[2:19:55] <%Undenizen> chicken noodle is a HIGH TIER SOUP, Pat
[2:19:57] <%SirKeigan> There's a whole book series about it
[2:19:58] <ahaegotrigger> TRUE
[2:19:59] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> lol someone is gonna go to bed hungry
[2:19:59] <%koolaid_kevster> wow pat
[2:20:00] <+AbnormalVoid> cmonBruh

[2:20:01] <MadDesperado13> VoteNay
[2:20:02] <%SirKeigan> Maybe there's something to it
[2:20:02] <%AzureGale> It's a good remedy wen you sick
[2:20:03] <peachy996> Chicken Noodle is good during the winter
[2:20:05] <%Finakala> Can't freeze possessed anyway
[2:20:08] <MasterTonberry23> Pat you really should be nicer to the only woman on the planet willing to touch you Kappa
[2:20:08] <Sir_Dolphinian> chicken always good
[2:20:09] <+TheBitingIrish> Chicken Noodle is honestly pretty bland
[2:20:09] <$ringabal> So Pat's implying Paige has anime levels of cooking
[2:20:09] <bigboy_baku> NotLikeThis
[2:20:10] <%SirKeigan> fuck that
[2:20:11] <%Dementedpenguin> I had to pause a game I was playing because of what you said
[2:20:12] <%SirKeigan> loser lol
[2:20:13] <%Dementedpenguin> WHAT
[2:20:15] <%realm_forge> Chicken noodle is god tier
[2:20:16] <lols_royce> you obviously havent tried my shit sandwich
[2:20:18] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> He doesn't play well either, HEYOOOOOOOOO
[2:20:23] <geassguy360> do not understand soup haters
[2:20:24] <%TheActuallyGuyR7> how do you not like chicken noodle soup?
[2:20:26] <+Spoonsire> I don't see food critic in your future
[2:20:26] <+TheBitingIrish> You gotta be a goddamn boss to make chicken noodle interesting
[2:20:31] <puse9> is Pat talking shot about chicken noodle soup?
[2:20:31] <black_pariah> what just happened
[2:20:38] <black_pariah> did he teleport
[2:20:39] <peachy996> (psst Paige, next soup you make for him, throw a fuckton of bay leaves in it)
[2:20:45] <Yummy_Nukes> ought to have made beef flavored ramen and throw some creole seasoning on it
[2:20:52] <+johnny_gogo> only 1
[2:20:56] <%1matheuw> revenanant?
[2:21:00] <%Undenizen> Pat, we're not letting this soup thing go.
[2:21:01] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Brocolli and cheddar is best soup
[2:21:05] <+johnny_gogo> you can 1 shot them in nighmare
[2:21:14] <TheAngryArtist> if you think chicken noodke is anywhere close to as good as potato bacon or broccoli cheddar you are insane
[2:21:14] <MasterTonberry23> pat just for that knock on chicken noodle i hope you never beat this section
[2:21:17] <+Spoonsire> I second broccoli cheddar soup
[2:21:29] <%PanicSwytch> 2 shots kill a reverend
[2:21:36] <%SirKeigan> French Onion says hello
[2:21:51] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Future Pat is so strong and good at game.
[2:21:55] <%CrookedSpiral> outplayed
[2:21:58] <%코코꾸라> French Onion Soup is the best soup, indeed
[2:21:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> Im with pat chicken noodle sucks
[2:22:01] <$ringabal> Pat, you can't Zero Escape your way out of a Doom level
[2:22:03] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Not like current Pat.
[2:22:08] <puse9> French onion is amazing!
[2:22:09] <black_pariah> did no one else see him telefrag through the geometry, or am i crazy
[2:22:10] <%realm_forge> Have u tho?
[2:22:10] <%MidnightBurst12> woah
[2:22:10] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Shit, I could go for some potato and bacon right now
[2:22:11] <%Calek> that seems like a bad idea
[2:22:14] <%ergulor> Make sure to have the lazer equiped
[2:22:14] <Saltmeisterr> I can't believe pat would diss the glorious chicken noodle
[2:22:16] <+johnny_gogo> @PatStaresAt spirits take less from plasma ammo
[2:22:30] <%realm_forge> @puse9 yes.
[2:22:36] <geassguy360> ROCKETS
[2:22:43] <%MidnightBurst12> pat has no soul for hating on chicken noodle
[2:22:46] <+RoeDeerRootie> chicken noodle? you mean the dane cook of soups?
[2:22:48] <%Finakala> You can move whilst microwaving
[2:22:56] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> freeze with grenade then kill spirit
[2:23:12] <peachy996> @RoeDeerRootie Oof Dane Cook of Soups? That's Pot Pie
[2:23:17] <MasterTonberry23> @MidnightBurst12 we already knew he had no soul to begin with :P
[2:23:23] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> you can freeze the others tho
[2:23:25] <+Javaa01> Spirit enemies cannot be halted in any way
[2:23:32] <%DedlokPM> @AvoidingTheCoronaVirus spirits/spirit possessed units are CC imune
[2:23:33] <geassguy360> if you kite them around that doesnt have to happen
[2:23:39] <+dayz1003> DA BABY
[2:23:40] <CoffeeSlice> EMLO
[2:23:42] <%TakingLifesL> I think I just zoned out for a couple of hours, what's going on?
[2:23:44] <geassguy360> they are resistant to it
[2:23:48] <+dayz1003> psaBlep
[2:23:49] <%JD_Lars> Spirits also take two BFG shots to kill
[2:23:49] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> ah, elmo, the lesser of the two
[2:23:50] <peachy996> @Javaa01 Only Microwave Beam stuns them
[2:23:56] <%realm_forge> LORD ELMO HATH COME
[2:23:59] <Yummy_Nukes> THE FIRST BORN SON
[2:24:01] <MidnightPacif1c> psaGib
[2:24:05] <%slimmixrp> Going to the store, y'all need anything
[2:24:08] <+johnny_gogo> If you wanna stop a spirit for a moment you have to microwave beam it
[2:24:11] <%Birdigalore> GAME OVER YEEEEEEEAH
[2:24:11] <peachy996> So you can suck them off a little throughout the fight
[2:24:12] <%1matheuw> killer indeed
[2:24:14] <MasterTonberry23> thats what you get for insulting chicken noodle soup
[2:24:14] <%코코꾸라> are you winning, son

[2:24:32] <%Finakala> Yeah, never stay still
[2:24:36] <CoffeeSlice> THE SOUP SENDS ITS REGARDS
[2:24:42] <%Undenizen> do you ever play these games and wonder what it'd be like to just shrug off 50 bullets?
[2:24:44] <%Birdigalore> Did you win at the nintendo , sweetie?
[2:24:45] <%Grimlockfly> what difficulty?
[2:25:02] <MasterTonberry23> also good lord how many demons do you have to kill before they let you out of here?
[2:25:07] <geassguy360> Possessed demons are resistant to plasma so using it on them is a waste
[2:25:07] <%DedlokPM> ultra nightmare
[2:25:08] <+Javaa01> UV
[2:25:13] <%Finakala> Many
[2:25:16] <MasterTonberry23> this really is more like painkiller than doom
[2:25:33] <%Calek> @MasterTonberry23 he hasn't seen the final phase yet, assuming it is the final phase
[2:25:34] <%DedlokPM> oh. ultra VIOLENCE my bad
[2:25:35] <+trashcansan> chicken noodle curse
[2:25:37] <%Calek> I never got past it
[2:25:41] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Its funny.
[2:25:53] <%Finakala> It is the final phase yes, Calek
[2:25:54] <%realm_forge> I miss painkiller...
[2:26:08] <+Javaa01> @DedlokPM Ultra Nightmare means if you die, your save gets deleted
[2:26:11] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Its funny how this is an FPS but aiming the the least important thing. Movement and enemy management are FARRRR more important
[2:26:12] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> Doctor_Death_Bed subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months, currently on a 42 month streak! 
[2:26:15] <%1matheuw> final stage?
[2:26:15] <Joeggernaut777> BFG maybe?
[2:26:23] <taro_m> the stake gun from Painkiller was glorious
[2:26:29] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> Thanks for the KPOPTT @doctor_death_bed
[2:26:33] <MasterTonberry23> painkiller was good, too bad its one of those games where only the first game in the series was good, and all its sequels were HOT FLAMING GARBAGE
[2:26:34] <SatoruMasamune> "If it's like Painkiller, then where's the gun that shoots shurikens and lightning?" he asked, knowing full well that they are very different games.
[2:26:34] <+dayz1003> @Joeggernaut777 bfg ammo is pretty scarce
[2:26:55] <%Puhff> ...well that's good? I don
[2:26:57] <geassguy360> yes
[2:27:00] <+dayz1003> My save on the dlc got soft locked at the underwater facility today RIP.
[2:27:01] <%Puhff> 't wanna burn to death
[2:27:07] <Joeggernaut777> true
[2:27:20] <puse9> muscle memory i guess?
[2:27:23] <%realm_forge> Cuz he deserved it
[2:27:26] <%Puhff> I know Kappa
[2:27:27] <%TakingLifesL> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat, there's a vid up on your youtube with the same title as this stream, what gives?

[2:28:07] <+dayz1003> part 1 the first
[2:28:09] <puse9> it's in the title
[2:28:11] <peachy996> Part 1 (Part I)?
[2:28:11] <Joeggernaut777> They ruined it
[2:28:12] <%Birdigalore> REBEL ONE

[2:28:30] <taro_m> Part 1 Part 1 The Beginning
[2:28:31] <+dayz1003> Part 1: 2 electric boogaloo
[2:28:40] <%Undenizen> I was saying Boo-urns.
[2:28:41] <peachy996> The naming convention of both DLC episodes is gonna be fun for you
[2:28:43] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> You should name it Pt 1 X, then Pt 1 S
[2:28:47] <+Javaa01> Darn, it was pre-recorded all along
[2:28:47] <%Puhff> nailed it
[2:28:48] <strifer413> part 1 part 2 intermission 2
[2:28:53] <%Ner234> I'm super late. Did I miss anything hype?
[2:28:55] <+Javaa01> Really got us

[2:29:29] <%JD_Lars> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead

[2:29:45] <%Ner234> @Dementedpenguin Aw manm that sounds hype ... LUL

[2:29:54] <+johnny_gogo> then small demons

[2:29:59] <Buttsoup_Barnes> how many lives does he have?
[2:30:02] <+Pyroclase> it'll possess a zombie
[2:30:04] <+Take_2_shots> Do you want the answer?
[2:30:04] <Zebroneath> I think one heavy keeps spawning.
[2:30:06] <+Javaa01> It just goes into the nearest enemy
[2:30:08] <%Calek> zero
[2:30:10] <peachy996> It won't always possess super heavies
[2:30:14] <Aydarkzero> can't have that
[2:30:22] <+johnny_gogo> you think
[2:30:25] <%Finakala> Eventually they just fuck off somewhere else
[2:30:31] <Buttsoup_Barnes> lol hes fucked
[2:30:36] <geassguy360> it will posses fodder
[2:30:44] <+johnny_gogo> just wait till 500mph imp is chasing youi
[2:30:44] <peachy996> Well it'll always want to
[2:30:44] <%Ner234> Would chat lie to you, Pat?
[2:30:45] <+Javaa01> It possesses the beefiest enemy nearby
[2:30:45] <+Take_2_shots> Sometimes it just possess wollie
[2:30:47] <Sir_Dolphinian> he's got the double venti luck so
[2:30:48] <%Finakala> I think it priortises them if they're close enough, but otherwise it'll go to anything nearby
[2:31:02] <KeystoneA2> Oh it gets very fun after this.
[2:31:02] <+Javaa01> This is correct
[2:31:05] <%UvBenServed> ...

[2:34:38] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> how much do you think pat is going to hate the final part of this level?
[2:34:40] <Aydarkzero> is this Requiem monkaS

[2:37:56] <Aydarkzero> rockets no good here?
[2:37:57] <SatoruMasamune> Pat, have you considered ripping and/or tearing? Perhaps until it is done?
[2:37:58] <geassguy360> THATS THE CUBE ATTACK SLOWING YOU
[2:38:03] <peachy996> Especially the Chain Gun because you have to slowly walk with it
[2:38:04] <Aydarkzero> or just to slow?
[2:38:06] <%Finakala> Rockets are alright
[2:38:06] <+LandOfTheWay> woah, major frame drops there
[2:38:09] <peachy996> When you already need the mobility
[2:38:09] <%Finakala> But Ballista is better
[2:38:19] <MasterTonberry23> whoa whats with the genshin impact hypostasis?
[2:38:23] <Aydarkzero> ah
[2:38:26] <geassguy360> THEY NEVER STOP
[2:38:36] <PhilMorgDev> Pat do you agree that the DLC feels rushed out compared to the base game? Theres some noticeable jank
[2:38:42] <PhilMorgDev> Still good tho
[2:38:42] <%realm_forge> The bosses in Doom eternal are so fucking creative
[2:38:45] <geassguy360> BLOOD PUNCH THE PINKIES FOR GODS SAKE
