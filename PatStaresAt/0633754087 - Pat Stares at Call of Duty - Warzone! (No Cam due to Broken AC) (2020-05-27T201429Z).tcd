[0:02:27] <Louie_Salmon> Can you guys believe it's been a month since FF7R came out
[0:02:30] <father_hill> this is just making me wanna boot apex ngl
[0:02:35] <%optimasmaximas> it was jittery when paige played it
[0:02:35] <PanicSwytch> Honestly Pat, this was awesome
[0:02:36] <SummonerMagno> dog
[0:02:37] <%cureneckbeard> past pat just waited 5 minutes and became present pat
[0:02:37] <%Prism_Wing> COD's stand, Keep Holdin' On, is too powerful
[0:02:37] <Hawkbone_> So turns out it was all RTX's fault, not CoDs
[0:02:37] <+Remery_> Dog
[0:02:39] <%Starotter70> Dog
[0:02:40] <BlkFlameKami> rtx isn't worth it dude
[0:02:40] <zamzoph> Wowee
[0:02:43] <%Mister_McDerp> I knew it was rtx
[0:02:44] <j0ustar> RTX's "Annoying little sister" mode is amazing
[0:02:46] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> so is it just over?
[0:02:46] <%Reveresao> So its Pat's flaut
[0:02:47] <terribleusername> don't be picky, drink the spoon
[0:02:47] <transporterthesequel> COD LIVES
[0:02:50] <%WheatlyXT> I wonder if Present Pat is mad at how competent Future Pat is
[0:02:50] <kindashagg> @Louie_Salmon Was thinking about that this morning. I can't at all
[0:02:51] <worldbrand> he doesnt drink spoons what a psycho
[0:02:53] <%cureneckbeard> dog
[0:03:02] <%chrispypopcorn> I still blame Future Pat
[0:03:06] <Taranfeeto> RTX voice is GPU and you have a 2080Ti...
[0:03:10] <transporterthesequel> Drink Spoon
[0:03:17] <%Starotter70> Brrrrr
[0:03:19] <venomfury86> Ballista
[0:03:20] <%Mr_Pylon> yay brrrrrr

[0:20:09] <%huskarl_zap> Pat "Some think they can outsmart me, maybe, maybe. I've yet to meet man who can outsmart bollet."
[0:20:11] <Dral54> You re switching guns while swapping TOO FAST
[0:20:18] <DesertPenguin> Yea but you have to actually kill them. Knowing where they are doesn't help if you don't do anything abou tit
[0:20:18] <terribleusername> close your heart to it
[0:20:26] <KingVantq> @lethallunacyx did they even fix ghost not countering the heartbeat sensor?

[0:20:37] <$TrulyIncandescent> w0ah
[0:20:40] <DesertPenguin> It's not as good late game because of that
[0:20:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> camping is generally recognized as a cheap tactic. in a battle royale game its a terrible idea.
[0:20:43] <%Starotter70> Wow
[0:20:44] <%lethallunacyx> @KingVantq Yeah
[0:20:55] <DesertPenguin> Camping is the name of the game. It sucks but it's the truth

[0:43:07] <DrkJP520> Is that Pat's first kill?
[0:43:18] <%ghostofsolomon> now i see why he puts attachments to M4A1 that helps with his aim
[0:43:19] <KingVantq> like his 6th
[0:43:28] <%TioXyco> first kill this run

[0:43:58] <terribleusername> don't want your dick to get shot
[0:44:06] <%Fenrirlives> yes gotta put the armor plate in front of your balls bro
[0:44:07] <+Remery_> The armor looks like sandwiches
[0:44:08] <%YaBoiShamoi> into your bag
[0:44:08] <%gespenst25> Wow that rock texture
[0:44:08] <count_bob> That's the most important place to put armor.
[0:44:09] <%Mister_McDerp> you put it in your vest
[0:44:09] <%UvBenServed> Gotta cover the ORB

[0:44:56] <%Rafferty3231> ... that just means they have even better
[0:44:57] <+Boylanator_94> You can open doors quietly by going ads before you open it
[0:44:57] <%gespenst25> What if they had one alread? :O
[0:45:07] <%Chimeraelite> tbh I prefer Dead Silence
[0:45:09] <%Mister_McDerp> stopping power is meh
[0:45:17] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> nice, a big open field - better run through it
[0:45:17] <%SirGO0SE> @Boylanator_94 oo didnt know that thats a good tip

[0:45:57] <Hawkbone_> It goes into a magazine forevver until you use all the bullets
[0:45:58] <+Boylanator_94> going ads also makes you walk quietly if you are trying to sneak up on a guy but have not got deadly silence

[0:46:58] <%Starotter70> BADA BADA
[0:46:59] <%Dingus_Tickler> Compared to Apex, the recoil in this game is out of control
[0:47:01] <%valriot> that is a magazine size
[0:47:03] <Tucker0603> @PatStaresAt the armor is being put into a plate carrier
[0:47:10] <Hawkbone_> @Promessa_EX Dunno if they changed it in the Warzone mode, but in standard multiplayer its always the full clip no matter how many bullets
[0:47:12] <%OctaivianRex> The stupid guitar is growing on me honestly.
[0:47:18] <mikash91> what's up with elmo cam?
[0:47:21] <DesertPenguin> I love how this is some people's first time watching a COD game and the "dudebro-ness" of it is so in your face lol

[0:47:35] <%Intersceptre> coward
[0:47:36] <%huskarl_zap> Pat sprays himself with Bull coom to give himself increase sexual powers.
[0:47:37] <%skelechief> Stopping power is a flat 2x damage buff at the cost of increased recoil
[0:47:39] <%skizzuto> Elmo's the reason we're all here anyway
[0:47:44] <%Starotter70> @mikash91 They are there to shield chat from Pat's glistening nipples

[1:01:08] <+BigWhoopMagazine> pretty gun
[1:01:14] <DesertPenguin> Riot Shield is a waste of a gun slot
[1:01:35] <DesertPenguin> You snipe with one gun, and you have assault rifle for anything else
[1:01:35] <+xeromage> I like shield
[1:01:37] <%SirGO0SE> swapping is faster than reloading
[1:01:37] <Chimera_Caim> not in solos, riot shield is good
[1:01:37] <Daxalog> Swap instead of reloading
[1:01:38] <+Invaderjaymz> sniper?
[1:01:39] <dinnydanny777> For close range
[1:01:39] <cosmicdischarge> sniper
[1:01:41] <%Mister_McDerp> for different ranges
[1:01:41] <%goose_attack_almanac> I like the Shield
[1:01:42] <%ghostofsolomon> LONG RANGE - SHORT RANGE
[1:01:42] <KingVantq> the only alternate gun i see is a sniper half the time
[1:01:42] <+R_BChe> 1 long range and 1 cloes
[1:01:42] <DesertPenguin> Sniping is KING
[1:01:46] <%Ynkubus18> its a cofort shield
[1:01:46] <Siebersboy> cuz muh meta
[1:01:46] <%cureneckbeard> drop your shield
[1:01:48] <+plebeiusMaximus> yeah shield's good for solo
[1:01:49] <dinnydanny777> For close range or long range
[1:01:51] <sora2025> BC BULLETS
[1:01:51] <+dmtjinni> u miss
[1:01:53] <Hawkbone_> AR for mid range, shotgun for short range, or sniper for long range.
[1:01:53] <bigbradish> One long range one short range
[1:01:56] <%ghostofsolomon> depends
[1:02:01] <%de1ete_forever> a myriad of raisins
[1:02:03] <+chrishnaw> swap to pistol is faster than reloading.
[1:02:04] <xenprecs> It’s for when you run out of ammo, or so you can snipe and still have a backup
[1:02:05] <+OblivionSword1> for different situations
[1:02:06] <%Mister_McDerp> sniper + assault rifle is a good combo
[1:02:06] <DesertPenguin> You're gonna die either way so.......
[1:02:07] <shurtal> Pat HATES getting shot..... in the back
[1:02:08] <Daxalog> We all do. My back is sensative
[1:02:09] <Hawkbone_> Switching to your pistol is always faster than reloading

[1:02:14] <%SirGO0SE> all these brutus' out here
[1:02:15] <%ghostofsolomon> pat's custom loadout is actually practical
[1:02:19] <dinnydanny777> Pistol works at a lot of ranges and reloads faster
[1:02:22] <worldbrand> You know, the only times ive ever won in pubg, i used dual tmps or dual shotguns

[1:05:27] <j0ustar> Motion blur needs to be destroyed
[1:05:29] <%XeroSigmaPrime> urn off world motion, gun is fine
[1:05:30] <ezack4> WHAT HAPPENED TO PAT
[1:05:33] <DesertPenguin> Motion Blur is a joke
[1:05:35] <+chrishnaw> Turn on RTX, bitch
[1:05:36] <DesertPenguin> OUR EYES DO IT NATURALLY
[1:05:38] <%arcielardor> and the screen tearing
[1:05:39] <%Intersceptre> ' i bought a 2080 and you must know'
[1:05:40] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> no, as in motion blur literally makes the game harder @PatStaresAt
[1:05:41] <%valriot> motion blur is okay, when its used properly (it rarely is)
[1:05:45] <Hawkbone_> Motion blur has never not been terrible
[1:05:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> @ezack4 Elmo ate him
[1:05:47] <+SaltyGhostRock> Motion blur LUL
[1:05:49] <Bacon_taco> who like motion blur?
[1:05:49] <%huskarl_zap> Turn OFF RTX
[1:05:50] <DesertPenguin> Extended mags
[1:05:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ezack4 He stopped fighting because his mind goblins forced him to fix his graphics ASAP.
[1:05:54] <worldbrand> It annihilates compression too
[1:05:54] <%Mister_McDerp> imagine liking motion blur
[1:05:57] <Incrodon> 1.5x scope...
[1:06:07] <j0ustar> oh look we have detail now
[1:06:08] <DesertPenguin> extended mags are key, and sniping is important
[1:06:08] <+OblivionSword1> I don't mind motion blur
[1:06:11] <%SirGO0SE> entering gamer focus
[1:06:12] <%huskarl_zap> NI *** DOLLERYDOOS
[1:06:13] <worldbrand> Or rather, compression annihilates video quality when motion blur happens too much
[1:06:15] <$Dakuu75> render resolution should alwayse be at 100% or higher, am I wrong?
[1:06:17] <%valriot> Capcom usually does good motion blur, especially in DMC5
[1:06:32] <%Starotter70> psaPorgmo
[1:06:38] <%huskarl_zap> No peeper means no dollerydoos
[1:06:38] <DesertPenguin> Motion Blur is bad for shooters. It's okay in action games if done right but never in shooters
[1:06:40] <%tigerspath> hi chat. how has Pat been doing so far?
[1:06:42] <ShichiNoBushi> RTX keeps us from hearing Elmo.
[1:06:43] <+plebeiusMaximus> i personally hate motion blur in this game
[1:06:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> now powerbomb the baby
[1:06:49] <%xcompleasedad> @PatStaresAt Have you accepted the Lord and Savior "Snakeshot" yet?
[1:06:50] <DesertPenguin> @tigerspath How do you think?
[1:06:53] <blink289> has someone told pat that pyramid head is going to be in dead by daylight
[1:06:53] <%skelechief> have you tried blood money/plunder?
[1:06:58] <%SirGO0SE> mmm air :)
[1:06:59] <%maenos2> hold baby gentle like burger
[1:07:01] <%huskarl_zap> TURN THE SPYWARE OFF
[1:07:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> I hate motion blur in any game where hand eye coordination and reflexes are important.
[1:07:05] <DrFaustMD> is war zone fun?
[1:07:08] <DesertPenguin> No
[1:07:09] <%valriot> squish that cat
[1:07:11] <%cureneckbeard> tasty ghosts.
[1:07:12] <%Intersceptre> snakeshots got nerfed
[1:07:13] <DesertPenguin> It's stressful
[1:07:14] <dinnydanny777> Pyramid Head got in another game before another Silent Hill game got made
[1:07:16] <Hawkbone_> I hate motion blur in every game. I almost threw up trying to play Horizon Zero Dawn last week.
[1:07:20] <%Starotter70> @blink289 Ye, he saw
[1:07:21] <%AgniBrandt> High quality broken cat

[1:07:40] <DrkJP520> How may maps are there?
[1:07:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Do you need to check him for worms?
[1:07:48] <%NickNackProductions> that feel when someone other than konami gives silent hill the love it deserves
[1:07:48] <DesertPenguin> Where is man? Shoot man.
[1:07:49] <Hawkbone_> @DrkJP520 In Warzone, one.
[1:07:50] <+plebeiusMaximus> just the one map so far
[1:07:52] <%NickNackProductions> its a weird feel
[1:07:54] <Nomad_Scholar> Prepare for an influx of Pyramid Head sfm pron
[1:07:55] <worldbrand> pyramid head getting into another game doesnt offend me, but heather being in another silent hill would have exploded my tits with excitement
[1:08:10] <%Starotter70> DO A FLIP

[1:08:20] <DesertPenguin> We can't see his health, but assume he needs to put shields on
[1:08:21] <%maenos2> Hah he did flip
[1:08:21] <PanicSwytch> Do a barrel roll
[1:08:24] <dinnydanny777> You should do bunny hops
[1:08:27] <%nofestu2> did a cool flip
[1:08:30] <+TheOneCalledRock> the greatest thing about the DBD announcement is all the people crying about the lore
[1:08:32] <dinnydanny777> If you bunny hop you win
[1:08:32] <%Agami23> your character has that one shitty superpower where you can turn invisible if you do a backflip
[1:08:35] <+TheOneCalledRock> like why are people like this
[1:08:35] <dinnydanny777> Strafe jump
[1:08:38] <DesertPenguin> @PatStaresAt What is your favorite snack food?
[1:08:43] <%skelechief> make sure you abuse mounting your gun when you can, makes you have 0 recoil
[1:08:45] <dinnydanny777> Do Quake jumps
[1:08:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> @eattheb0otylikegroceries If he could speak, I think he would constantly say "Give Fur" the same way Peach goes "GIve Coin." LUL
[1:08:49] <Nomad_Scholar> @Th3SmartAlec when someone actually makes a model of Triangle Girl then, yes
[1:08:55] <DesertPenguin> The opposite of "drop your shield"
[1:08:56] <%huskarl_zap> I just remembered something. Fuck you pat and woolie The Gouf was a good gundam it beat Amuro like 5 times.

[1:09:11] <%depressed_skeleton> He did
[1:09:16] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> @CommanderSqueaks more like "Give white fur only"
[1:09:16] <+Magmalefilme> hey gud
[1:09:22] <+Promessa_EX> mounting is bad, jumping is good
[1:09:26] <Hawkbone_> Gun mounting is very powerful. Most people will be able to track you easily anyway.
[1:09:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> @eattheb0otylikegroceries But he has black fur too.
[1:09:29] <+kapcommunist> pat is cracked

[1:10:44] <+pectusumbra> Is Pyramid Head's thing bigger than buster sword though?

[1:52:23] <%Starotter70> It's over Anakin
[1:52:24] <rufus2k2> are you kidding me pat
[1:52:24] <%cureneckbeard> spinning that's a neat trick
[1:52:24] <+Promessa_EX> You can take cover by backing up
[1:52:26] <ThirdPersonPhil> if the game has ballistics you can literally shoot farther
[1:52:26] <%xcompleasedad> You move back, and you have cover.
[1:52:27] <dinnydanny777> You can be behind cover and shoot people beneath
[1:52:27] <$Dakuu75> better angle at their HEAD dude.
[1:52:27] <%Diana869> @PatStaresAt aiming down is way more easy than up
[1:52:27] <%ghostofsolomon> cover
[1:52:28] <shurtal> see more, less of you availalbe to shoot
[1:52:28] <%TioXyco> advantage vision
[1:52:29] <+Patitentiary> Sith hate the highground
[1:52:30] <%alcors_wisdom> if youre above someone with a gun their head is a proportionally bigger target as well
[1:52:30] <Robot_Nixon_> The floor is also cover
[1:52:30] <%kyh9> You can move back but they can't
[1:52:32] <%coffeeabomination> Genuinly better visibilty and their cover isn't as effective
[1:52:33] <%DensityD> GL HF
[1:52:33] <%Mister_McDerp> aiming up is harder than aiming down
[1:52:33] <%MakotoPB> Easier to shoot down at something
[1:52:34] <%cureneckbeard> the bullets move faster downward because of gravity
[1:52:34] <+Karebuncle> you can see over their cover cause you're taller
[1:52:35] <Daxalog> No one around you. No one above you. You can see over the enemy
[1:52:36] <KingKZ> bullet drop
[1:52:36] <dinnydanny777> You can shoot people but they can't shoot back
[1:52:37] <%spiritofmojave> Real talk visibility I guess, people don't look up with roofs?
[1:52:38] <DesertPenguin> FISH IN A BARREL
[1:52:38] <Frostydough1> High ground has more cover
[1:52:38] <%MakotoPB> work with gravity
[1:52:38] <%Mister_McDerp> yep
[1:52:38] <%Ninestempest> you can literally just back up and lose visibility
[1:52:39] <@SoFarFetched> I assume c ause you can use the roof as cover cause they'd have to find the right angle to shoot you.
[1:52:41] <%spiritofmojave> I don't know
[1:52:43] <%Jekado> you have less cover if someone above you
[1:52:43] <Robot_Nixon_> ???
[1:52:43] <%MakotoPB> gravity
[1:52:45] <%de1ete_forever> people like to get camp and get high
[1:52:45] <$TrulyIncandescent> LUL but why
[1:52:45] <hmhmh6532> danHmm
[1:52:45] <+mczarklesby> Easier to shoot from high to low than low to high. Bullet drop isn’t as big of a thing.
[1:52:45] <dinnydanny777> You have a wall in front of you
[1:52:46] <primaryfire> easy to take cover at any point in the fight and strafe while exposing yourself minimally, more likely to hit the head while aiming down
[1:52:46] <+brightman42> that's more of a real life thing
[1:52:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Higher visibility, the enemy is more exposed than you are.
[1:52:46] <%Intersceptre> you degrade the angle of cover
[1:52:47] <+Virtual_Rays> Pat....
[1:52:47] <ammobasket> easier see over low ground cover
[1:52:47] <cool_culainn> gravity
[1:52:48] <Luizabd> TYhe fucking sun
[1:52:48] <%cylish> Cover, youre a smaller target when looked up at, and people dont look up honestly, its not a normal habit
[1:52:48] <DesertPenguin> Fish in a fucking barrel dude
[1:52:48] <%Aeoneth> More of your body is exposed wherease the lower person has more of their head exposed
[1:52:49] <%Mister_McDerp> because of angles and shit
[1:52:49] <%ghostofsolomon> BUTTTTT
[1:52:49] <@SoFarFetched> while aiming down you're like "Oh I can see your head peeping out"
[1:52:50] <$TrulyIncandescent> I love you pat
[1:52:50] <%TioXyco> because
[1:52:50] <Srthunda> try it, then you will see
[1:52:51] <%Ninestempest> this is literlaly the dumbest question
[1:52:52] <%dekkitout> Because math, Patrick
[1:52:52] <%kyh9> It's Cover
[1:52:53] <+EySoyCoco> less muscle memory required¿
[1:52:54] <+Zereaux> SHIT ROLLS DOWN HILL PAT
[1:52:54] <+kapcommunist> gravity
[1:52:54] <%xcompleasedad> Pat, this is the most fucking stupid you have ever been
[1:52:54] <%MrBorisMakarov> you can see what you're aiming down to, up is a gamble @PatStaresAt
[1:52:56] <%bendatron> more cover up than down
[1:52:56] <%MakotoPB> bullet is not weightless
[1:52:57] <%ghostofsolomon> IF YOURE UP AND SOMEONE HAS A KILLSTREAK
[1:52:57] <%Nobrev> you can shoot down over your own cover but they cant @PatStaresAt
[1:52:58] <Daxalog> THEY have less cover since your above them and can shoot over them
[1:52:59] <%TioXyco> sniping position, that's why
[1:53:00] <%cylish> You have to train yourself to look up
[1:53:01] <+oda_flobunaga> THE SUN
[1:53:01] <%WhereIsWill> wow pat LUL
[1:53:02] <%ghostofsolomon> YOU GOTTA MOVE
[1:53:02] <%xcompleasedad> Literally TRY IT OUT
[1:53:03] <$ThomasOfTroy> Literally more comfortable
[1:53:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> Gravity.
[1:53:03] <tad4631> Atoms
[1:53:04] <%luftraumm1> sightlines
[1:53:04] <+Sudokuclan> You can avoid them completely by just backing up if you have high ground, if you're flanked from above you have to get behind something which can be harder than justing moving back
[1:53:06] <%tigerspath> less of you to taget.
[1:53:07] <rufus2k2> I don't like these pretend questions
[1:53:08] <%ArcanumMBD> If you both have waist-high cover, the angle from being high up lets you see more of them than they can see of you
[1:53:08] <%de1ete_forever> why up so good?
[1:53:08] <DesertPenguin> @PatStaresAt Fish in a barrel dude, It's like fish in a barrel
[1:53:08] <+mczarklesby> Bullet gravity. :D
[1:53:08] <Melchior_the_Wise> You would be anakin before cut
[1:53:09] <%spiritofmojave> NO ME :)
[1:53:10] <%xcompleasedad> RIGHT NOW
[1:53:13] <%xcompleasedad> TRY IT OUT
[1:53:15] <+vicar_anat> be nice pat, sharing is caring
[1:53:15] <dinnydanny777> They can only shoot you when you shoot them
[1:53:17] <+Delenay> they want to feel like cool military man
[1:53:23] <%WhereIsWill> you can see more of them, and they can't see you
[1:53:23] <primaryfire> you are aiming down at someone whose head constitutes a larger % of their silhouette from that angle
[1:53:24] <Djinnazz> Pat doesn't understand tactical advantageges.
[1:53:28] <PanicSwytch> Have u not seen Star Wars episode 3
[1:53:31] <CosmosDeity> They can only see your head, but you can see their whole body
[1:53:47] <%de1ete_forever> I like to keep this handy, for close encounters
[1:53:49] <+brightman42> nice
[1:53:49] <+GeneralHysterics> MORNIN
[1:53:49] <%taku_toots> Ah
[1:53:51] <%ChaosAethr> OH Dhit
[1:53:52] <%MakotoPB> Pat should understand the disadvantages of having to look up at something

[1:54:03] <DesertPenguin> FOR HIM
[1:54:03] <Aji__> p90 is god tier in my opinion
[1:54:03] <%ghostofsolomon> SMGs are best for close quarter
[1:54:03] <mrblack499> can you splat your self in this game

[1:54:21] <PanicSwytch> I have the high ground anakin
[1:54:22] <+oda_flobunaga> Why Tho?
[1:54:24] <Frostydough1> Guaranteed if he had a mic on it wouldve been a high pitched squeal of fear

[1:55:02] <DesertPenguin> Not for you, to hear them
[1:55:02] <+brightman42> death comms are for off-air funsies
[1:55:03] <+GeneralHysterics> people gonna say some shit to get you banned
[1:55:08] <DesertPenguin> Oh yea, lol

[2:02:53] <%DensityD> psa2guy
[2:02:55] <%cureneckbeard> 7
[2:02:57] <Siebersboy> near death 9 times out of 10
[2:02:58] <HologramInteractive> kill for most of them I think
[2:02:59] <%Jekado> i think different snipers do different ammounts
[2:03:00] <%ghostofsolomon> no armour-sniped =death
[2:03:00] <Melchior_the_Wise> about 3
[2:03:02] <%cureneckbeard> 11
[2:03:04] <SGrim> Big Bullet + Chest = Kill
[2:03:07] <%spiritofmojave> Roughly, around 3? 3 what? just 3 :)
[2:03:13] <+Promessa_EX> if it's a bolt it's gonna kill to chest
[2:03:14] <ha2ken> Range drop off probably comes into play allso
[2:03:14] <%alcors_wisdom> depends on sniper+attachments but at least high damage
[2:03:15] <Chimera_Caim> depends on the range
[2:03:16] <Melchior_the_Wise> yeah, just about 3
[2:03:17] <%Dingus_Tickler> Quick Maths
[2:03:18] <%TrebassTV> streamsniped

[2:03:54] <primaryfire> one in the pipe
[2:03:57] <+Virtual_Rays> That was horrible
[2:03:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Did Pat get more kills sniping than he did last few matches?
[2:03:59] <mrblack499> running is a bad idea in 1v1
[2:04:00] <SauceJockey> M203 grenades have a minimum arming distance

[2:04:08] <+Shyveon> @PatStaresAt Are you playing solos?
[2:04:09] <%ArcanumMBD> Pat I just tweeted a pic at you that shows why high ground is good in shootgames
[2:04:19] <%MrBorisMakarov> ruff
[2:04:19] <Melchior_the_Wise> He's on the roof
[2:04:21] <%TrebassTV> roof
[2:04:26] <ha2ken> They were probably dropping in or on the roof
[2:04:26] <%ghostofsolomon> i like it when pat doesnt know what's happenoing and then owns the opponent
[2:04:27] <AmericanaRed> "I NEED ARMOR"
[2:04:29] <%Mister_McDerp> you'll learn
[2:04:30] <%MrBorisMakarov> just learn lol
[2:04:32] <Melchior_the_Wise> Usually a Ladder
[2:04:34] <%DensityD> constantly adapt
[2:04:35] <Melchior_the_Wise> or maybe some stairs
[2:04:40] <dinnydanny777> The sound the door makes is funny to me for some reason
[2:04:43] <@SoFarFetched> Its because Pat is short and needs to feel taller on the roof.
[2:04:44] <+kapcommunist> superstore
[2:04:45] <ha2ken> Some buildings cannot be climbed up to
[2:04:47] <+oda_flobunaga> This Fortnite skinn is really realistic
[2:04:48] <VirtuaRailith> Use your webs
[2:04:50] <%spiritofmojave> Ladders can be used to escalate to higher places
[2:04:51] <%TioXyco> DPS Adapt!
[2:04:51] <%Mister_McDerp> door is louder than gunshots
[2:05:02] <T_Sasquatch> Staircases ... Ladders
[2:05:02] <%ghostofsolomon> pat has problems with height
[2:05:10] <HologramInteractive> access to roof from main building would make people camp more probably. the big buildings in the promenade have roof acces but it's 15 floors
[2:05:16] <%de1ete_forever> cause the second dive is faster
[2:05:18] <%ghostofsolomon> because they deployed too?
[2:05:20] <balquisa> they're better than you :)
[2:05:23] <%Auriel_Astrum> go up 15 flights of stairs, jump off and don't pull your parachute
[2:05:24] <%de1ete_forever> after u cut parachute
[2:05:30] <royb2> for a short period of time after releasing the parachute you glide faster
[2:05:31] <DracaenaLeaf> Those jukes
[2:05:31] <Hawkbone_> Good job
[2:05:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Good run
[2:05:34] <%MrBorisMakarov> good job

[2:24:59] <Hawkbone_> @oda_flobunaga That was PUBG, this game didn't exist a few years ago.
[2:25:02] <+YabbaTroll> pat you still didnt check the bathroom
[2:25:13] <$Dakuu75> "long range smg" really?
[2:25:22] <+YabbaTroll> :P

[2:25:38] <%ghostofsolomon> rooftop ahead
[2:25:39] <turbofolk> guy popped you because you ignored the bathroom
[2:25:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat loves being in toilets, but he hates looking at them, the paradox is astounding.
[2:25:43] <+oda_flobunaga> @Hawkbone_ PUBG Warzone, Tomato Tomahto,
[2:25:46] <+Zagreus> Pat is something else
[2:25:51] <$Daisuke89> !uptime
[2:25:51] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 26m.
[2:25:52] <dinnydanny777> He could have heard that fall
[2:25:52] <%Mister_McDerp> always check the toilet
[2:25:55] <+oda_flobunaga> Kappa
[2:25:59] <Hawkbone_> @oda_flobunaga They're actually hugely different.
[2:26:02] <+de_pressed02> i saw him on the next roof
[2:26:07] <@SoFarFetched> @CommanderSqueaks I mean he did used to poop in the dark so he wouldn't see himself pooping LUL
[2:26:15] <%ghostofsolomon> next roof-watchout
[2:26:16] <%Chimeraelite> It's called that because they made the AUG baseline an SMG. It's using a conversion kit @Dakuu75 to go back to 556
[2:26:17] <ha2ken> Careful buy station
[2:26:20] <%Diana869> i was gone did pat get the bounty?
[2:26:21] <+oda_flobunaga> Sarcasm intended
[2:26:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> @sofarfetched There are so many ways I could imagine that going horribly wrong.
[2:26:33] <%Chimeraelite> although the naming is fucking stupid
[2:26:33] <%Prism_Wing> @diana869 neaux
[2:26:41] <Hawkbone_> Its like calling Halo and CoD the same thing, really.
[2:26:49] <$Dakuu75> @Chimeraelite oh, wild.
[2:26:52] <Hawkbone_> Or CoD and CSGO.
[2:26:58] <+dklordg> @diana869 no, got sent to the gulag after getting killed by some dude on the toilet

[2:30:44] <dinnydanny777> But I guess that would be too broken
[2:30:46] <%Prism_Wing> Just take off your shoes
[2:30:47] <primaryfire> dead silence is a perk that silences your footsteps for like 20 seconds

[2:31:09] <ha2ken> Wowzers
[2:31:10] <+Remery_> The game should make it so if someone hides in the bathroom, the toilet loudly flushes so everyone spots them

[2:32:04] <%spiritofmojave> Teaming jerks
[2:32:07] <+acejwilliams> Hey Pat, have you ever tired giving Dragon Age Inquisition a try again? I know you tried streaming it a while back but gave up on it because of technical issues.

[2:32:23] <%Livelinne> psaBig pee
[2:32:25] <$ItsRatman> Was that the adrenaline leaving pat's body?
[2:32:28] <j0ustar> Pat stop oiling the pepperonis
[2:32:28] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Yo you should really black out your screen when you queue tho
[2:32:29] <%de1ete_forever> the banks get heated, cuz mooney
[2:32:31] <ha2ken> Why not solo Q in squads? LUL
[2:32:32] <Cobaltor_252> has he exposed his balls on stream yet
[2:32:32] <%cureneckbeard> psaCrazyhand
[2:32:37] <$Dakuu75> the bucket is now for sweat. he only has one bucket
[2:32:44] <%Bailey__gaming> Pat has a Real Nice rank
[2:32:47] <Straxx__> rank 69, nice 👌
[2:32:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The orb is full, it must be purged

[2:33:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> He's doing okay
[2:33:12] <%de1ete_forever> the servers are supper chill compared to PC key and mouse
[2:33:12] <ha2ken> Pat is now on toilet hating his own existence
[2:33:15] <$Dakuu75> @jaketify he is... better than the worst, i'd say.
[2:33:32] <%Livelinne> Teaming is bad here?
[2:33:44] <%vectorless_peon> whos that on screen? bring back the cat
[2:33:47] <+Shubreaker> in solo yeah
[2:33:49] <$Dakuu75> in solos? yes @Livelinne
[2:34:10] <%GinAndRoses> teaming in solos is shitty since there's squad modes
[2:34:19] <%Livelinne> I see, thanks yall
[2:34:37] <ha2ken> But people also run solo without caring about teammates in squads so...
[2:34:42] <$Dakuu75> we're gonna find out Paige has ben talking for the past hour but, Pat has jsut been ignoring her and RTX has been mutting her
[2:34:50] <%de1ete_forever> u'd have to be a real dick to team in solos
[2:35:02] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> lmao if RTX was sexist
[2:35:10] <$Dakuu75> lol
[2:35:15] <Jaketify> yo how is the rtx thingy, can we still hear the baby?
[2:35:27] <%Livelinne> hiiii

[2:35:36] <$Dakuu75> agreed
[2:35:40] <turbofolk> Aha
[2:35:40] <+kapcommunist> play with Plague?
[2:35:41] <%Starotter70> After the Timeskip
[2:35:48] <%WhereIsWill> psaBig facts
[2:35:55] <%Binary_Fireball> AIM AT HEAD LEVEL
[2:35:59] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> i haven't been super invested in cod since the early lifespan of blops3
[2:36:05] <ToneBacas> IRL?
[2:36:09] <%Nobrev> lol no
[2:36:12] <turbofolk> Your logic is always 70% flawed
[2:36:19] <%WhereIsWill> sprinting to cover is better than walking in the open
[2:36:21] <%Reveresao> other players : Oh lord he coming
[2:36:21] <%Nobrev> sprinting is loud as fuck
[2:36:24] <BlackOrchidKI> Just came in -- What's up with the cam?
[2:36:24] <+YabbaTroll> think how much your standing still watching open areas
[2:36:25] <%GabeSweetMan> Hmm, hang on a minute, how do you clip in this twitch layout??
[2:36:32] <CrimsonGargoyle> Rank sixty-nice
[2:36:32] <alwayspronking> sprint in open spaces, walk in closed
[2:36:36] <TheArrow_> sprinting has always been the solution in the shooters i've played
[2:36:37] <ToneBacas> sprinting isn't stealthly
[2:36:41] <%Binary_Fireball> hug walls
[2:36:45] <+de_pressed02> @GabeSweetMan Alt+X
[2:36:48] <%Intersceptre> SprInt when you clear cover, walk when you're near buildings
[2:36:48] <%GinAndRoses> also makes it take longer to ADS when they do turn on ya
[2:36:50] <turbofolk> Being out in the open is better for me specially if i havwe a sniper
[2:36:54] <%GabeSweetMan> Aaah thanks @de_pressed02
[2:37:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Good aiming
[2:37:26] <%Intersceptre> You drive fast on the freeway because you can see, you drive slow in the city because you can't. same process
[2:37:27] <%코코꾸라> You can reload while aiming
[2:37:32] <%코코꾸라> It takes a bit longer but you can
[2:37:40] <%WhereIsWill> see!? HIGH GROUND
[2:37:47] <+YabbaTroll> chat did they add any new guns to modern warfare/ warzone since launch?
[2:37:55] <Vyskus> hi
[2:37:55] <+YabbaTroll> i need my mp5k
[2:37:58] <OlavOlavsson> So when do we get a BR game with cute school girls and boys, you know, like the og Battle Royale
[2:38:01] <%Intersceptre> yes yabba, a couple per season
[2:38:12] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt High Ground/Better sightline
[2:38:12] <turbofolk> "time to see what you learned" nothing apparently
[2:38:13] <KingVantq> @YabbaTroll whatever guns are in the battlepass you get in warzone and the base game
[2:38:16] <%Intersceptre> MP5 is in the base game, just mod it short
[2:38:20] <+acejwilliams> Hey Pat, have you ever tired giving Dragon Age Inquisition a try again? I know you tried streaming it a while back but gave up on it because of technical issues.
[2:38:21] <$ragingbrachy> is his facecam tied to is air conditioning in some way
[2:38:39] <+Shubreaker> he nakey
[2:38:43] <+Zereaux> YES HE HAS
[2:38:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @ragingbrachy He isn't wearing a shirt because it's hot
[2:38:44] <%Starotter70> Pat is too embarrassed to show us his Milky Nipples
[2:38:46] <KnightAsteran> @ragingbrachy he's shirtless and covered in sweat
[2:38:47] <s1rcuit> fuck the olympia
[2:38:50] <+YabbaTroll> @Intersceptre it aint the same, (unless it is in this game, i dunno)
[2:38:50] <%Piemono> DA:I is not great
[2:38:57] <KingVantq> @YabbaTroll sks and burst pistol are the newest til season 4 on the 3rd or 4th of june
[2:38:59] <$ragingbrachy> oh FeelsBadMan
[2:39:00] <+Zereaux> its not
[2:39:07] <%Fooguwu> game bad
[2:39:17] <+YabbaTroll> oooh
[2:39:19] <OlavOlavsson> Double barrel shotty is the best shotty in this game imo
[2:39:20] <%Intersceptre> @yabbatroll the MP5 is totally modular, you can shorten it i think, better for close
[2:39:20] <+Zereaux> didnt that game get super shafted by ea
[2:39:23] <%코코꾸라> monkaS
[2:39:24] <+Shubreaker> it tells you how good it is based off its abbreviation
[2:39:30] <%de1ete_forever> M4A1 with 9mm mags and grenadier barrel is the most stable headshot lazer when i was playing it a month ago, dont know about now tho
[2:39:32] <DracaenaLeaf> snek

[2:48:47] <%GabeSweetMan> Weaponizing Crazy Talk makes the stand stronger. It unfortunately backfires much harder as a result. As the first half of this stream demonstrates.

[2:53:20] <%Starotter70> PRO psaBlep GAMER
[2:53:28] <dinnydanny777> The way to win is by being a big coward
[2:53:28] <%ghostofsolomon> hes not top 10 yet
[2:53:36] <%king_wragles> Are ya winning, son?
[2:53:39] <DesertPenguin> I mean in the last 45 minutes
[2:53:40] <dinnydanny777> If your the biggest big coward you'll just win
[2:53:43] <+KingXANA> look at the top right of the screen @DesertPenguin
[2:53:45] <%Intersceptre> Pat is quite keen on being a low land gorilla. Get on a roof and peep the folk
[2:53:47] <%ghostofsolomon> lookat top right 32 more
[2:53:48] <dinnydanny777> Just avoid all gunfire
[2:53:54] <$Dakuu75> I'd say 80% coward , 20% gun jumper
[2:53:54] <%king_wragles> No seriously, how's Pat doing?
[2:53:58] <DesertPenguin> Guys, I'm not talking about right now, jesus christ
[2:53:58] <primaryfire> top 20 in this game is top 10
[2:54:01] <%GabeSweetMan> Pat's out of pools!
[2:54:02] <%de1ete_forever> Pat is doin it
[2:54:06] <DesertPenguin> I said in the last 45 minutes, has he had many Top 10 matches?
[2:54:06] <s1rcuit> @king_wragles pretty good
[2:54:10] <%king_wragles> Nice!
[2:54:12] <%ghostofsolomon> oooooooooooooo

[2:54:21] <Ipsenscastle> All the getting bodied at fighting games always makes me surprised when Pat is good at FPS's and shit
[2:54:24] <+EySoyCoco> yare yare nice gun
[2:54:25] <s1rcuit> @king_wragles check the top right
[2:54:26] <SGrim> M4 over AK? Alrighty
[2:54:27] <%ghostofsolomon> someone ditched the launcher for a sniper rifle
[2:54:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Intersceptre He has to stay close to the ground so that his Dwarf magic can work
[2:54:30] <primaryfire> breathe
[2:54:34] <+kapcommunist> made it out of pools i see
[2:54:34] <$Dakuu75> do ALL sniper scopes glint? or jsut the thermals?
[2:54:35] <%Diana869> lets go top 25 here we come
[2:54:36] <dero45> dey comin
[2:54:40] <dinnydanny777> That fart gas is kind of intimidating to be honest
[2:54:41] <Jontman42> the guns have stupid colors to indicate their goodness
[2:54:44] <KnightAsteran> @sgrim M4 is the meta gun fir this game
[2:54:45] <DesertPenguin> Did he start using snipers more since that one time up in the crane?
[2:54:54] <Jaketify> @Dakuu75 im pretty sure all scopes do
[2:54:55] <DesertPenguin> dude you're so open
[2:54:56] <Kain5707> elmo stream yea!
[2:54:56] <%ghostofsolomon> yes
[2:54:57] <%sourceofall> you are so exposed right now
[2:54:58] <Ipsenscastle> this is super fucking exposed
[2:55:00] <+dmtjinni> BAD, MOVE, ROOF BAD

[2:55:06] <%Diana869> oh thank god he can see
[2:55:06] <MAX116030> isnt thermal scope useless when everybody running with cold blodded perk?
[2:55:07] <DesertPenguin> NEVER STAND STILL LIKE THIS
[2:55:08] <+tigerfang86> this is like SUPER fuckin open
[2:55:10] <primaryfire> all sniper scopes over a certain level of magnification glint. I wanna say anything higher than 4x?
[2:55:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Jontman42 So the gayer the gun, the better the shoot?
[2:55:12] <%king_wragles> @s1rcuit 30 people, 7 skulls got it (I haven't played COD since MW2)
[2:55:14] <SGrim> @KnightAsteran but given Pat's aim, I'd say the AK is probably more his speed.
[2:55:19] <j0ustar> exposed = B A D
[2:55:20] <+tigerfang86> @GarbageQueenEllie just like in real life
[2:55:26] <s1rcuit> @DesertPenguin you missed the great shot he made on a guy on an atv to the chest at like 500m

[2:58:32] <%PlagueOfGripes> I did my first mission and died because I couldn't figure out how to leave a building. Got 11 levels and finished #15 I think?
[2:58:33] <Jontman42> it was a good plan
[2:58:33] <%GabeSweetMan> 9 damn kills wow
[2:58:33] <%Diana869> top 25 is always good imo
[2:58:34] <%ghostofsolomon> thats good

[2:58:35] <%WhereIsWill> bruh you rocked that match tho
[2:58:35] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @s1rcuit shallow breaths and snorting sweet tea. Got it!
[2:58:36] <KyxricXIII> 22 aint bad with 9 kills too
[2:58:38] <ha2ken> Might have been fine if you didn't get stuck on the door
[2:58:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Only cowards succeed, it is known
[2:58:40] <primaryfire> damn level 72
[2:58:42] <@SoFarFetched> that was still a really good run though
[2:58:42] <%de1ete_forever> murder is what matters
[2:58:47] <+KingXANA> The only thing that can beat a coward is a bigger coward.
[2:58:49] <KyxricXIII> you were cleaning house

[2:58:53] <Straxx__> but a lot of kills though ristreCat
[2:58:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> He had the high ground
[2:59:02] <dero45> jaboodyDANK
[2:59:04] <dinnydanny777> Isn't the SCAR the ultimate fortnite weapon
[2:59:04] <$Dakuu75> the hard part is leveling up different guns. to unlock attachments, I think.
[2:59:09] <Jaketify> ah yes, the sacrifice to the activision gods
[2:59:09] <%ghostofsolomon> cahnged the PILA
[2:59:14] <%ghostofsolomon> REMOVE PILA
[2:59:21] <%Intersceptre> @patstaresat Swap to the JOKR and use the new stock on the M4
[2:59:23] <primaryfire> amped and tracker are the best yellow perks
[2:59:32] <Ipsenscastle> Pat appears to be doing really well with a controller on PC too
[2:59:34] <JetpackMcQuack> Campers like that might not be worth pushing
[2:59:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> Gun needs more purple. Maybe some dickbutts
[2:59:37] <DesertPenguin> JOKR

[2:59:42] <%optimasmaximas> RELOAD FOREVER
[2:59:46] <%ghostofsolomon> and slow
[2:59:46] <DesertPenguin> Jokr has a set and forget and fires from above
[2:59:46] <%toomuchsnarfsnarf> Pass
[2:59:47] <+TheUltrahumanoid> my first match ever i got 0 kills and finished 11th LIKE A TRUE COWARD
[2:59:47] <KyxricXIII> because youll be looking cool
[2:59:48] <%Intersceptre> JOKR or the Renetti pistol
[2:59:49] <%ghostofsolomon> no no knoife
[2:59:49] <%Bailey__gaming> Revolver
[2:59:52] <%Bane_Kaikyo> N I F E
[2:59:53] <DesertPenguin> SNIPER
[2:59:55] <%OldManDeckardCain> buying battle pass? It'd be MUCH wiser to buy samsho on pc which is exclusive to epic store #SPONSORED Kappa
[3:00:02] <$TrulyIncandescent> Jokr isn't amazing unless you're taking out trucks
[3:00:03] <Dral54> JOKR is the old Javelin
[3:00:04] <+YabbaTroll> does the jokr work exactly like the javelin did in mw2?
[3:00:05] <j0ustar> what do you mean ew
[3:00:12] <%de1ete_forever> first you learn long range, the knife is that last thing you will learn
[3:00:15] <%Mister_McDerp> M16 barrel
[3:00:19] <Siebersboy> your loadout is pretty pog tbh
[3:00:19] <+BigWhoopMagazine> You need that 60 round mag dude
[3:00:22] <%PaladinDupre> I like revolvers for secondary
[3:00:23] <DesertPenguin> Extended mags
[3:00:25] <breakerdsx> Use the HUG ELMO
[3:00:27] <%ghostofsolomon> ammo
[3:00:27] <NotHereToStream> 60 rnd mag indeed
[3:00:28] <+flexin_apex> Damn pat u A ok in FPS mp
[3:00:29] <%WhereIsWill> use red dot sight??
[3:00:29] <%Trair> Youll get a better supressor later. Prioritize damage range and ADS speed otherwise
[3:00:30] <%ghostofsolomon> AMMO
[3:00:30] <%Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat bigger mag,
[3:00:32] <%optimasmaximas> @PatStaresAt rubberized tape grip>granulized
[3:00:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> You gotta make the gun look like a anime girl
[3:00:40] <DesertPenguin> Go check out JackFrags videos
[3:00:43] <+jgalena> get the suppressor that only hurts bullet velocity
[3:00:44] <FutaSnek> @PatStaresAt Get a lighter stock for mobility, merc forgrip for stability, and mags
[3:00:48] <primaryfire> bigger mag can go a long way in this game but idk about it in solos
[3:01:03] <raginggayguybd> pso2 has knifes
[3:01:04] <%ghostofsolomon> HAVE STABILITY
[3:01:05] <%Intersceptre> @patstaresat You get a better Suppressor later, change the Barrel to a tactical one, maybe FMJ, scope of choice and the STOCK
[3:01:09] <%Mister_McDerp> longer barrel
[3:01:13] <%ghostofsolomon> thats all
[3:01:14] <$Dakuu75> I think it was the muzzel and grip that effect recoil the most. the other slots do what you want
[3:01:14] <DesertPenguin> You want recoil and mobility
[3:01:17] <%de1ete_forever> grenadier barrel
[3:01:21] <%de1ete_forever> is a must
[3:01:23] <Owlboy7> the m16 barrel is the most important thing
[3:01:26] <%Intersceptre> the Barrel barrel, not underbarrel
[3:01:33] <%Mister_McDerp> M16 barrel is good
[3:01:34] <DesertPenguin> Remember you can only have 5 attachments
[3:01:43] <%ghostofsolomon> yep
[3:01:45] <FutaSnek> Ehh - bullet velocity
[3:01:46] <%de1ete_forever> welp
[3:01:46] <DesertPenguin> yea that's good
[3:01:48] <%ghostofsolomon> but you cna only have 5 att
[3:01:52] <%Intersceptre> Commando barrel shroud is great
[3:01:55] <primaryfire> ah he doesn't have the chunky barrel
[3:02:00] <%de1ete_forever> at least commando looks cool
[3:02:04] <SauceJockey> commando barrel reduces range
[3:02:04] <DesertPenguin> Put on the commando barrel for the stock
[3:02:05] <Siebersboy> fuck the extra mags
[3:02:05] <SauceJockey> don't use it
[3:02:11] <KingVantq> @PatStaresAt remove the stock until you get a better one
[3:02:12] <%Intersceptre> Eff the extra mags
[3:02:12] <+BigWhoopMagazine> I'd recommend iron sights once you get comfy with it
[3:02:13] <+Promessa_EX> commando is more of an mp thing
[3:02:13] <FutaSnek> @PatStaresAt The stock can go the change is minimum if you wanna put the other barrel on
[3:02:16] <FutaSnek> YEs
[3:02:18] <KyxricXIII> yeah
[3:02:18] <%ghostofsolomon> yes
[3:02:18] <%optimasmaximas> yes
[3:02:19] <DesertPenguin> Yes
[3:02:23] <%Bailey__gaming> @patstaresat blood money is good for wepon unlocks
[3:02:23] <dinnydanny777> I don't think you're gonna use the knife
[3:02:28] <%Aydarkzero> wont hide you from Astro A40's Kappa
[3:02:29] <+Shubreaker> yeah
[3:02:31] <DesertPenguin> Exchange the stock for the commando barrel @PatStaresAt
[3:02:32] <%Intersceptre> Switch the Mags for the Barrel
[3:02:32] <%ghostofsolomon> SEONCDARY PISTOL AT LEAST
[3:02:36] <+valentinostand> show us your tits PAT
[3:02:42] <SauceJockey> @PatStaresAt commando barrel reduces your damage range, do not use it
[3:02:51] <+Peebioh> tape grip
[3:02:53] <%PaladinDupre> REVOLVER
[3:02:53] <+Promessa_EX> renetti
[3:02:54] <JetpackMcQuack> Pistols are strong
[3:02:56] <MrDonTacos_> revolver
[3:02:56] <%optimasmaximas> cause sidearms are useful
[3:02:57] <nobknee> Pat okay? He get a haircut?
[3:02:58] <%Intersceptre> The Renetti rocks
[3:02:59] <+jgalena> renetti
[3:02:59] <+BigWhoopMagazine> i like the 1911
[3:02:59] <@commanderclaw> Swapping to a pistol and shooting is faster than reloading
[3:03:01] <+Shubreaker> 1911
[3:03:02] <KyxricXIII> Renetti if youre using a pistol
[3:03:04] <%Aydarkzero> gotta switch to something quick
[3:03:05] <+oda_flobunaga> USE FISTS COWARD\
[3:03:05] <+YabbaTroll> 357 for yeehaw time
[3:03:05] <dinnydanny777> Is there an automatic pistol?
[3:03:06] <%PaladinDupre> REVOLVER FOR DAMAGE
[3:03:06] <DesertPenguin> Not by that much
[3:03:07] <DesertPenguin> Range is fun
[3:03:08] <DesertPenguin> fine*
[3:03:09] <$TrulyIncandescent> As Price once said "Switching to your pistol is faster than reloading"
[3:03:09] <Dral54> switch goes fast with pistol
[3:03:13] <%de1ete_forever> u will never use a pistol
[3:03:18] <CurrySauseBandit> Would Pat ve matched with people that even look at their minimap?
[3:03:20] <Siebersboy> stock over tape imo
[3:03:21] <%Intersceptre> The ADS speed matters the MOST, commando barrel is good
[3:03:22] <%goose_attack_almanac> 45 Deagle-like pistol is good
[3:03:26] <Owlboy7> @PatStaresAt just keep leveling to 36 where you get the good barrel
[3:03:26] <DesertPenguin> None of this really matters that much to be honest
[3:03:26] <%optimasmaximas> @PatStaresAt FMJ lets you should through walls and has increases armor penetration
[3:03:30] <FutaSnek> The grip tape will do less for ya then a stock usually used to stack stability
[3:03:34] <%optimasmaximas> @PatStaresAt shoot*
[3:03:43] <%Bailey__gaming> @patstaresat either a deagle or the revolver
[3:03:44] <FutaSnek> FMJ is good
[3:03:45] <%ghostofsolomon> but it doesnt work right?
[3:03:52] <%ghostofsolomon> FMJ DOESNT APPLY RIGHT?
[3:03:53] <%Intersceptre> FMJ does damage through surfaces
[3:03:55] <primaryfire> isn't aim stability just less sway when you ADS? never relevant outside of sniping
[3:03:56] <FutaSnek> That looks pretty good
[3:04:02] <DesertPenguin> 1911
[3:04:03] <FutaSnek> The renetti is nasty
[3:04:03] <+YabbaTroll> 357 always
[3:04:03] <SauceJockey> FMJ is just increased bullet penetration and damage to vehicles and streaks, it does not do increased damage to players
[3:04:04] <DEndknight> FMJ doesnt do shit
[3:04:05] <Monkeyweed21> high caliber
[3:04:05] <DesertPenguin> damage
[3:04:06] <%optimasmaximas> @Ghosthand246 fmj lets you shoot through walls better
[3:04:06] <+jgalena> renetti
[3:04:06] <$Dakuu75> I remember trying to understand FMJ and it seemed not good
[3:04:06] <+kapcommunist> no idead
[3:04:07] <%asgard147> limesThink
[3:04:08] <%ghostofsolomon> something to finish off
[3:04:08] <+Shubreaker> 1911
[3:04:09] <MrDonTacos_> revolver ocelot
[3:04:11] <%Intersceptre> The Renneti
[3:04:12] <Dral54> Renetti is good
[3:04:15] <%ghostofsolomon> renetti is orite
[3:04:15] <FutaSnek> Either that or 1911
[3:04:16] <SauceJockey> M19, Desert Eagle, Renetti
[3:04:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> BIG GUN
[3:04:19] <%goose_attack_almanac> GS and Renetti are great
[3:04:19] <%optimasmaximas> chat FMJ lets you through walls more
[3:04:20] <DesertPenguin> Why renetti?
[3:04:26] <+Real_Hornet> @patstaresat use the RPG and check rooms with it
[3:04:27] <%asgard147> limesThink limesGun
[3:04:28] <NotHereToStream> Deagle imo
[3:04:29] <dinnydanny777> When you run out of ammo for your main gun switch to the pistol instead of reloading
[3:04:29] <%Intersceptre> Dual Renettis just got nerfed, still god tier
[3:04:30] <%PlagueOfGripes> I don't understand any of this system
[3:04:31] <corepercentlives> Hand cannon
[3:04:32] <KingVantq> the renetti was op about an update ago
[3:04:34] <primaryfire> FMJ is not increased damage to players, only penetration
[3:04:34] <DesertPenguin> FMJ not worth it when you can have better sight mobility or something
[3:04:35] <+kapcommunist> its damage thru walls right?
[3:04:37] <$Dakuu75> I think Wounding is better, imo
[3:04:37] <+codepoke> deagle
[3:04:38] <JetpackMcQuack> Damage go up
[3:04:38] <DEndknight> how often do you shoot through walls...
[3:04:39] <%Trair> FMJ is worthless. It doesnt affect Warzone armor like it does in MP
[3:04:40] <FutaSnek> The renetti has fast rate of fire and decent mag capacity
[3:04:42] <%ghostofsolomon> agaisnt equipment and killstrks
[3:04:44] <Monkeyweed21> damage against equipment only
[3:04:46] <%optimasmaximas> @kapcommunist yess
[3:04:49] <%Chimeraelite> Slight of hand all the way
[3:04:51] <SauceJockey> sleight of hand
[3:04:51] <%de1ete_forever> u will rarely ever use ur pistol, ur better using an RPG
[3:04:52] <KingVantq> sure
[3:04:53] <%optimasmaximas> damage through walls tho
[3:04:57] <+GuardsmanSaber> FMJ is very situational. The damage up bar is very misleading
[3:04:59] <FutaSnek> Slight of hands is just straight DPS
[3:05:00] <$Dakuu75> sleight of hand or wounding, I'd say. yeah.
[3:05:11] <%asgard147> me too limesEvil
[3:05:12] <DesertPenguin> You'd be better off with a gun attachment instead of a perk but okay
[3:05:13] <+oda_flobunaga> Shoot it into a closet
[3:05:14] <Rivalshotzgp> Use a RPG secondary or a Javelin
[3:05:16] <Dral54> Rpg is good if someone is trying to run over you if you ve got itme
[3:05:17] <%ghostofsolomon> RPG is ok but don't shoot it near you
[3:05:18] <FutaSnek> He's learning PogChamo
[3:05:21] <FutaSnek> PogChamo
[3:05:22] <%Intersceptre> RPG to corner check what next
[3:05:23] <FutaSnek> Fuuuuuck
[3:05:24] <%ghostofsolomon> causes damage
[3:05:25] <%nofestu2> big bada boom
[3:05:26] <%goose_attack_almanac> 50 Cal Pistol is high damage and reliable at short ranges. Renetti is good fire rate and accuracy. Both solved many problems for me personally.
[3:05:28] <FutaSnek> PogChamp
[3:05:30] <+kapcommunist> i see tons of pro gamers getting mad at rpg players so... that means its meta?
[3:05:31] <+Shubreaker> get his ass
[3:05:32] <dinnydanny777> Can't you just shoot the pistol through walls
[3:05:34] <SauceJockey> not with what he has, sleight of hand is the best option
[3:05:40] <DesertPenguin> told ya
[3:05:47] <oceanmatt> what barrels or suppressors are available atm
[3:05:49] <DesertPenguin> lmfao
[3:05:55] <+BigWhoopMagazine> Eventually you'll unlock the monolithic supressor which is the bees knees
[3:05:57] <SauceJockey> he only has the tactical suppressor
[3:05:57] <%linkster291> linkster291 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! Interesting to see Elmo enacted his master plan to take over the stream for the coming weeks. Only one flaw his kitty brain did not account for, now he has to sit in the heat.
[3:06:02] <ha2ken> Just try it and adjust
[3:06:03] <%de1ete_forever> when in doubt, shoot it out ~ RPG player
[3:06:03] <primaryfire> rpg is often a free kill if you wait for the right moment
[3:06:05] <FutaSnek> LUL I do the same shit with this system cant make up my mind theres so many attachments LUL
[3:06:06] <%Intersceptre> I'd ditch mags for the barrel, having m4 power in a SMG package is great
[3:06:10] <DesertPenguin> Just to spite me for saying "told ya"? lol
[3:06:13] <KingVantq> more damage range
[3:06:14] <%ghostofsolomon> range and suppression
[3:06:15] <Siebersboy> chonky suppresor
[3:06:15] <%Trair> Supression + dmg range
[3:06:16] <DesertPenguin> it increases range
[3:06:16] <$Dakuu75> it's like the last one on the list.
[3:06:17] <%optimasmaximas> the best suprresr
[3:06:17] <%ghostofsolomon> and range dmg
[3:06:19] <oceanmatt> suppressor but with less damage falloff
[3:06:20] <%Intersceptre> A better suppressor
[3:06:20] <Owlboy7> @PatStaresAt attachments are shit until level 36 onwards anyway
[3:06:20] <Dral54> The last one
[3:06:22] <$ItsRatman> it turns your gun into a baseball bat
[3:06:23] <FutaSnek> @PatStaresAt The monolithic suppresor is a suppresor that adds damage range
[3:06:34] <%Trair> Gunsmith is the best part of this game
[3:06:40] <%TrollKing96> I just learned the M4 isn't an M4, its a Colt Model 933.
[3:06:50] <Dral54> You can level the guns by playing multiplayer too
[3:06:50] <FutaSnek> Suppresors actually do help bullet velocity IRL due to legthening the barrel, fun fact
[3:06:51] <DesertPenguin> It's like Battlefield. You use gun, you unlock gun progression
[3:06:53] <%de1ete_forever> vertically challenged
[3:06:53] <$Dakuu75> is there a way to test guns and mods in game without having to go into a match?
[3:07:00] <KingVantq> this is a Cod 4 map btw Pat
[3:07:04] <SauceJockey> in the base multiplayer, not in warzone @Dakuu75
[3:07:11] <Monkeyweed21> Pat cant get it up confirmed
[3:07:13] <+Promessa_EX> cod gun names are weird
[3:07:15] <+Zereaux> THE M4 IS THE MILITARY DESIGNATION FOR THE AR 15
[3:07:16] <FutaSnek> OOF
[3:07:21] <$Dakuu75> @SauceJockey ah-yeah, gotchya
[3:07:21] <%de1ete_forever> that bro is a gamer
[3:07:22] <rufus2k2> BITCH
[3:07:22] <%GabeSweetMan> Whelp
[3:07:24] <DesertPenguin> @Zereaux no it's not
[3:07:26] <$ragingbrachy> poor pat
[3:07:31] <NotHereToStream> ar 15 is only semi auto, m4 is full+semi
[3:07:41] <Cactuskris> no u dont want to
[3:07:42] <Dral54> Level up with multiplayer
[3:07:44] <+YabbaTroll> hell yeah comrade
[3:07:45] <+Promessa_EX> ak is fun
[3:07:46] <%ghostofsolomon> AK recoil is bad right?
[3:07:46] <FutaSnek> The AK is great with attachments, naked its ehh
[3:07:46] <Jaketify> cod4 stream when
[3:07:51] <primaryfire> oddly difficult to control the AK in this
[3:07:56] <$Dakuu75> AK's recoil is vicious
[3:07:57] <%Ninestempest> make sure to run ak with no attatchments just likd cod4
[3:07:58] <DesertPenguin> The M4 and M16 are fully automatic, and they must be to qulify as such, but the AR-15 is the semi automatic version of the M16, in today's gun world that is all the distinction, it could have any barrel length but as long as it is semiautomatic and is still an AR/M16 type rifle it is considered to be an AR 15.
[3:08:00] <+Promessa_EX> recoil is fun
[3:08:02] <Cactuskris> ak sucks
[3:08:05] <%PaladinDupre> the 1911 was the best gun in COD4
[3:08:12] <%ghostofsolomon> I PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER
[3:08:13] <FutaSnek> LUL
[3:08:14] <%Intersceptre> You can mod the AK into a nasty little SMG tho
[3:08:15] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[3:08:15] <+SausageShogun> LUL
[3:08:16] <%nofestu2> LUL
[3:08:16] <%Starotter70> LUL
[3:08:16] <MrDonTacos_> LUL

[3:08:20] <%ghostofsolomon> no shame in palying with controller
[3:08:21] <$Dakuu75> crazy talk~
[3:08:23] <FutaSnek> SHE TALKS CRAZY TALK
[3:08:23] <%asgard147> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[3:08:24] <%PlagueOfGripes> good work, Arin
[3:08:25] <twoto858> Crazy Talk
[3:08:27] <%ChaosAethr> The LORD
[3:08:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> LUL
[3:08:29] <@commanderclaw> The lord has forsaken you
[3:08:29] <%Starotter70> psaCrazyhead
[3:08:32] <%GabeSweetMan> psaCrazyhand
[3:08:33] <$ragingbrachy> :)
[3:08:35] <primaryfire> it feels like the AK has a bunch of horizontal recoil
[3:08:42] <Robot_Nixon_> BlessRNG
[3:08:43] <$Dakuu75> Your stand, is an ass hole Pat.
[3:08:48] <$ragingbrachy> the lowered
[3:08:48] <DesertPenguin> What's really good is taking an SMG and giving it a longer barrel to have assault rifle range. It still has SMG mobility. The AUG is good for this since it can get 50 or 60 round magazines
[3:08:51] <KingVantq> @PatStaresAt you can turn the AK into the 74u basically in this game
[3:08:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> @plagueofgripes Oof, that's just mean.
[3:08:57] <%arcaderabbit48> Does it?? Because this seems pretty on par
[3:08:57] <%GabeSweetMan> As I mentioned earlier, the weaponization of crazy talk only empowers it to backfire all the harder.
[3:08:58] <%de1ete_forever> Pat was saying something about controllers, go on
[3:09:09] <%ChaosAethr> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[3:09:28] <DesertPenguin> @PatStaresAt At the range you're using assault rifles, you'd be better off using SMGs
[3:09:31] <%WhereIsWill> pat too short LUL
[3:09:35] <%Trair> this is standalone so it can go forever
[3:09:37] <%ChaosAethr> It Will
[3:09:40] <%de1ete_forever> it's a good game
[3:09:41] <+auspiciousdgg> Is Machinima back? Why is Pat playing a CoD game?
[3:09:42] <$Dakuu75> black got hard-ruined? how?
[3:09:42] <%Jekado> it does look fun
[3:09:48] <%ghostofsolomon> ruined how?
[3:09:51] <%PlagueOfGripes> the menu keeps showing me a lot of things it won't let me use
[3:09:52] <TeaJayGee> if you aim at a door and then click, it will open slowely and not make as much noise
[3:09:53] <%Jekado> microtranactions
[3:09:55] <JetpackMcQuack> Is this a service game?
[3:09:55] <primaryfire> Activision loves ruining things
[3:09:56] <Dral54> We talking about a big evil company
[3:09:59] <KingVantq> Lootbox guns
[3:10:00] <$Dakuu75> OOoooh, that sucks
[3:10:03] <NotHereToStream> there isn't any ptw in blackout if i recall
[3:10:08] <%wolfofsound> pay to win in activision? you jest
[3:10:09] <%Jekado> hard ruined with expensive ass micro tranactions
[3:10:10] <Cactuskris> why don´t you want to play with your discord friends though
[3:10:11] <@SoFarFetched> @PlagueOfGripes is it all attached to dollar signs?
[3:10:12] <+Shubreaker> blackout was buried in straight up p2w lootboxes
[3:10:13] <KingVantq> they said no lootbox guns then brought them right back
[3:10:21] <Monkeyweed21> Pat loves his Cooty Dooty Point n' Shooty
[3:10:23] <%Jekado> i think the biggest was charging 2 dollars for a sight that was from the old game
[3:10:26] <NotHereToStream> it was only vehicles the fucked up blackout
[3:10:27] <%Diana869> i wonder is apex is still good
[3:10:28] <%de1ete_forever> they plan on making Warzone an evolving app, that releases with each new COD game
[3:10:31] <%Jekado> and not a sight persay just a pattern
[3:10:34] <+auspiciousdgg> I always imagined Tarkov would be more of your thing Pat, since it's hard as balls and requires a massive time investment.
[3:10:34] <%Diana869> if*
[3:10:35] <+Promessa_EX> this game just has pay to lose skins and bright pink tracers
[3:10:43] <primaryfire> apex just started season 5 and it's great
[3:10:46] <%Trair> They plan to release a new Map with every new COD game. So warzone is *THE* COD BR
[3:10:49] <%ghostofsolomon> ooo military is a trickya rea
[3:10:49] <%Jekado> I wouldn't mind seeing pat do tarkov
[3:10:51] <JetpackMcQuack> Activision has done late monetization patches before
[3:11:01] <dinnydanny777> I can hear panting
[3:11:01] <%PlagueOfGripes> oh, CP I guess is the mtx store currency
[3:11:01] <+YabbaTroll> F
[3:11:04] <%Diana869> F

[3:11:07] <maybefalco> LUL
[3:11:10] <$Dakuu75> @Diana869 Apex jsut started its 5th season like last week-ish. It's good, imo. but ppl are annoying and trash, there's only squad BR
[3:11:11] <+LegacyOfTheSith> wubbyGrinch
[3:11:13] <+BigWhoopMagazine> NIce audio, game
[3:11:16] <Owlboy7> @PatStaresAt this game actually has pay to lose bright skins and color tracers for guns LUL
[3:11:30] <Straxx__> spray on opponents in the gulag, it's fun LUL
[3:11:31] <%Diana869> @Dakuu75 k thx
[3:11:36] <DarkSideCow> Yeah apex is alot of fun very team based though not made for solo
[3:11:40] <DracaenaLeaf> The best
[3:11:43] <DesertPenguin> @Dakuu75 Duos is secretly solo mode lol
[3:11:43] <+Karebuncle> pay to style on nerds more like
[3:11:46] <OzzySnek> games are pretty fucking scary
[3:11:47] <+Shubreaker> it's for style
[3:11:47] <plusultrachef> wow
[3:11:48] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt the way it should be
[3:11:50] <%Diana869> its for style
[3:11:50] <%de1ete_forever> gotta flex tho
[3:11:51] <maybefalco> ayyy
[3:11:51] <DesertPenguin> @Dakuu75 or you can add me, I play a lot
[3:11:52] <%goose_attack_almanac> Black Ops 4 made me very sad because I just wanted to play Snake-Eyes and go Knife only in multiplayer but then they released a Ballistic Knife in Microtransactions and then I was just super disadvantaged if I ever ran across another knife boy
[3:11:52] <Valentinius_Anodyne> They raise your Style Score though
[3:11:53] <%nofestu2> good job
[3:11:55] <DracaenaLeaf> Gulag pro
[3:11:57] <+JoeSketchy> Oh yeah, solo queuing in Apex is a fucking nightmare
[3:11:57] <$TrulyIncandescent> Pay to lose is a perfectly acceptable monitization strat
[3:12:06] <%ghostofsolomon> oh damn farm
[3:12:09] <+aClassySkelly> aclassyskelly subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:12:10] <Kain5707> @PatStaresAt but warframe though
[3:12:10] <@commanderclaw> How the fuck is this game 100 gigs?
[3:12:10] <%king_wragles> Ya, I remember seeing that GIll. Shit sucked
[3:12:12] <+LegacyOfTheSith> if you buy battle pass you can earn back cod points to buy the next pass i beleive
[3:12:16] <dinnydanny777> Having a Pink gun makes you a Gunslinger
[3:12:26] <%de1ete_forever> a Gunslinger Girl if u will
[3:12:30] <$TrulyIncandescent> @commanderclaw uncompressed textures are a bitch
[3:12:30] <KingVantq> @commanderclaw almost 200gigs or is 200 at this point
[3:12:32] <%goose_attack_almanac> @commanderclaw I'm pretty sure downloading Warzone downloads the rest of Modern Warfare too
[3:12:38] <Monkeyweed21> unlike Paige Pat was not raised in a barn
[3:12:50] <+LegacyOfTheSith> it definitly installs the full game
[3:12:50] <+Remery_> Step up your foraging squirrel
[3:12:52] <maybefalco> @LegacyOfTheSith yeah, but you have to be willing to play enough to max out the battlepass to get the codpoints back
[3:12:53] <+UMBRELLAROCKS> ELMO CAM!
[3:13:13] <+LegacyOfTheSith> ive got enough back from about level 70
[3:13:15] <KingVantq> i think on my xbox MW is 190 gigs right now NotLikeThis
[3:13:22] <DesertPenguin> It's about 180 yea
[3:13:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> There's a certain roguelike I enjoy, Tales of Maj'Eyal, that has a pay-to-lose microtransaction to summon an absurdly overpowered enemy to kill you, with no real benefit to doing so
[3:13:39] <primaryfire> @goose_attack_almanac not quite, with the full game you get about 30 gb added on top
[3:13:44] <DesertPenguin> I don't install the campaign or spec ops modes though. You can install just MP which includes Warzone
[3:13:44] <masterfire23> so pat is mad nude because of the AC
[3:13:58] <%wolfofsound> pat's balls are literally out
[3:14:01] <%de1ete_forever> and covered in oil
[3:14:05] <%Ner234> ORB exposed
[3:14:06] <+Remery_> No underwear
[3:14:06] <$TrulyIncandescent> suuure
[3:14:09] <nobknee> Kreygasm
[3:14:09] <Cobaltor_252> why are you wearing pants tho
[3:14:10] <$ragingbrachy> haha pats balls
[3:14:10] <%Starotter70> Assless Chaps
[3:14:10] <studleydoorite> but where are you wearing pants
[3:14:10] <%GabeSweetMan> Sure pat
[3:14:11] <BionicPulga> platyFAIL
[3:14:12] <%wolfofsound> flapping everywhere
[3:14:12] <%king_wragles> @Valentinius_Anodyne sounds like PURE bragging rights
[3:14:13] <primaryfire> OK I'm wrong it's much more than 30
[3:14:14] <+auspiciousdgg> Are they pajama pants Pat?
[3:14:15] <%WhereIsWill> he lies
[3:14:16] <ha2ken> Careful someone may be in the area...you did not open that one door
[3:14:16] <Kain5707> @Valentinius_Anodyne thats pretty great actually
[3:14:18] <dinnydanny777> Pat is in fact, shirtless in the rain right now
[3:14:22] <%LuckyLagomorph> would we because of rtx though?
[3:14:23] <DesertPenguin> Why would you be so mobile that they'd be plopping?
[3:14:26] <%Ynkubus18> Pats balls are real live ones
[3:14:26] <%wolfofsound> the balls are down in the groove
[3:14:29] <+Promessa_EX> that's a lie, rtx would filter it
[3:14:29] <@commanderclaw> Coward
[3:14:30] <+BigWhoopMagazine> They move on their own
[3:14:31] <%Piemono> We would hear the wet sticking sound of wrinkled flesh on leather
[3:14:32] <+MorelK> are you spraying youself?
[3:14:32] <BionicPulga> brucegTOS
[3:14:33] <%Livelinne> only pants? woolieSMUG
[3:14:36] <stanlychicken> are you at least wearing a bra?
[3:14:38] <deepspaceshine> Of course they're pajama pants
[3:14:39] <%BubbaRands> Grey Sweats Kappa
[3:14:40] <jimmytwofeet> PAT IS COLLA DOODY MAN NOW
[3:14:44] <%de1ete_forever> Pat appreciates the value of a well oiled orb
[3:14:49] <Monkeyweed21> Did you know that RTX voice was specifically designed to pick up the sound of pre stream masturbation?
[3:14:50] <%realm_forge> A wet slapping as they dangle in the breeze...
[3:14:52] <Hazard_Kujacker> I cant belive Pat is playing with his balls out now
[3:14:59] <%optimasmaximas> good
[3:15:00] <%nofestu2> fine

[3:15:09] <+Remery_> pretty good
[3:15:09] <%Diana869> its okay
[3:15:10] <%wolfofsound> better than the paige stream LUL
[3:15:10] <ammobasket> Audio good
[3:15:11] <ha2ken> It's fine...watch for that one guy
[3:15:12] <yeetdabsenpai69> your muted
[3:15:12] <+R_BChe> does pat still have delay on?
[3:15:13] <%Piemono> too much ball noise
[3:15:13] <%Intersceptre> decent audio, we hear the game
[3:15:14] <%Livelinne> Guddo
[3:15:16] <DracaenaLeaf> it's loud
[3:15:17] <Cobaltor_252> would sound better without pants tho
[3:15:18] <+kapcommunist> can we turn the bullets down and the feet up?
[3:15:19] <+Promessa_EX> cod is a loud ass game
[3:15:20] <%optimasmaximas> it's maturally loud
[3:15:21] <%Diana869> it was worse earlier
[3:15:21] <%de1ete_forever> not enough ball noise
[3:15:24] <+valentinostand> vehicles are LOUD
[3:15:25] <+Shubreaker> loud as hell
[3:15:28] <primaryfire> this game is loud as FUCK

[3:15:32] <%gespenst25> Seems cool psaBlep_SG
[3:15:34] <masterfire23> are you using the qc 35
[3:15:36] <+Remery_> loud to hear all those T-rex stomping around
[3:15:37] <$ragingbrachy> cant hear you pat
[3:15:40] <@commanderclaw> Could be more juicy
[3:15:41] <+taltalheights> Pat is in the middle of a furious game of strip-CoD
[3:15:54] <DesertPenguin> Holy shit, is Pat gonna start playing Gran Turismo next?!
[3:15:57] <ha2ken> Recon just lights up a big flare showing everyone where you are though
[3:16:03] <primaryfire> I have to mute the game during the lobby and plane ride or I'll go mad
[3:16:04] <+FattimusSlime> Is Pat miserable in his nice balmy 17C Canadian weather
[3:16:26] <shubachi> its more like 32C in montreal right now...
[3:16:26] <%de1ete_forever> it's like the scene in Ace Ventura 2 with Pat in the robot Rhino
[3:16:31] <%optimasmaximas> yeah
[3:16:34] <$ragingbrachy> 17c? he wishes
[3:16:41] <%Treuan> But how would you feel tense without musical accompaniment?
[3:16:43] <+Promessa_EX> i mute music
[3:16:45] <TeaJayGee> you can turn that off i think
[3:16:50] <$Dakuu75> "Hnnng, Colonel... I'm trying to sneak around but, I'm dummy-thic and the clap of my ORB keeps altering the guards!"
[3:16:50] <Frostydough1> You can turn it off im pretty sure, it was annoying me too
