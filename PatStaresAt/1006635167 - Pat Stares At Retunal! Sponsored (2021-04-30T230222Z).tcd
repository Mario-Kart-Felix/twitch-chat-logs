[0:10:57] <+walternatorz> he's got his snaggletooth game on point

[0:12:14] <%JoshManVGH> Account at risk
[0:12:14] <%EsotericOdyssey> @dekkitout woolie almost read leaked script details from FFXIV out loud on stream while Minh was playing for Woolie to see
[0:12:14] <Teras_ode> sick
[0:12:17] <%HitchhikingThrough> how did this translate to mihn getting banned
[0:12:20] <%BoxNavy> cant wait for pat to give woolie shit for this on monday
[0:12:22] <+glgzephyr> @dekkitout Woolie decided that reading out leaked spoilers for the NieR raid series THREE WEEKS FROM NOW was a great idea
[0:12:24] <+tigerstyle96> what did he do
[0:12:26] <%king_wragles> Wait, does Pat read out lmao as a word or did I have a stroke?
[0:12:26] <tanarath> Minh happened @daxalog

[0:12:34] <%ChestMimik> I can't believe Minh almost murdered Woolie
[0:12:35] <+SignScratch> oh shit.
[0:12:37] <%Mendin> Because Minh was being streamed on his account at the time
[0:12:37] <%shurtal> CATHARSIS
[0:12:42] <+glgzephyr> @HitchhikingThrough He's not banned, but he very well could have been had no one stopped woolie

[0:13:04] <%Blackleafx> psaGoblin
[0:13:04] <Blank9> I still don't get how people consider trailers spoilers if it's like... the only real trailer a game has, made by the people who made the game.
[0:13:06] <%camsool> Question for you when's RE Rev2?
[0:13:07] <+walternatorz> That's a scary thought.
[0:13:07] <+D00msDayDan> i can't believe woolie conspired with the whole town to not talk with pat about nier
[0:13:08] <%Agami23> wait, what did woolie do that could have gotten woolie banned?
[0:13:10] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt the basic premise of Obra Dinn was considered a spoiler by Woolie
[0:13:11] <%HitchhikingThrough> @glgzephyr I missed the explanation
[0:13:11] <%AzureGale> Bask in the vindication
[0:13:11] <%SirGO0SE> psaSmug
[0:13:13] <%Dementedpenguin> If you told me a year ago that Woolie would be streaming chaotic FF14 streams, I'd be flabbergasted.
[0:13:13] <Rionxgarland> little fat boy
[0:13:14] <redial_nick> he made his bed
[0:13:16] <%king_wragles> Not even as right as proposing to Paige?
[0:13:17] <@SSaryn> Is this even gonna be discussed on the podcast at this point? Woolie is JUST gonna sandbag it.
[0:13:17] <%Bailey__gaming> BIG RIGHT
[0:13:18] <%Agami23> or gotten mihn banned i mean

[0:13:23] <%JoshManVGH> "At least I've never spoiled a 600hr game!" Says Pat
[0:13:23] <+SoySocks> spoiler dodging only becomes a problem when people go "i'm not playing it, BUT WHAT IF THO"
[0:13:24] <GigaSeifer> [CRAZY TALK] is charging
[0:13:24] <%Blackleafx> psaSmug psaSmug

[0:13:26] <PleasedWorld> moral of the story: pat is always right, ever
[0:13:27] <Reanimator83> That might be a heart attack Pat Kappa
[0:13:28] <bob900000> oh no he has too much power
[0:13:29] <%DrBunni> is he still going on about woolie breaking his own spoiler code hardcore?
[0:13:29] <DaKnightWarrior> The podcast is going to be GOOD next week lytWHAT

[0:13:38] <%luftraumm1> wait what the fuck happened?
[0:13:39] <%dekkitout> Only a matter of time till Woolie plays LoL after Riot releases their fighting game then
[0:13:40] <%EsotericOdyssey> Are the stars in unholy alignment? Is that why you're the only one with a sensible take on spoilers right now?
[0:13:40] <%holydeviant1> Woolie is a bull in a china shop over in FF
[0:13:42] <%Dakuu75> what happened? I jsut got hear and heard Pat being on an "I'm RIGHT~!" high

[0:13:47] <rufus2k2> @SSaryn He can't sandbag getting his dirty laundry aired
[0:13:48] <+glgzephyr> Monday is going to be a RIOT
[0:13:49] <@SSaryn> He's JUST gonna apologize and sandbag it.
[0:13:50] <tyrell42> If Pat's THIS RIGHT,  i'm scared for the next crazy talk activation
[0:13:51] <LordOfThePoultry> crazy talk requim?
[0:13:53] <+SignScratch> wanting the world to bend to appease your need to consume content in a vacuum is silly
[0:13:55] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  so what is this about Woolie and Nier that has everyone freaking out?
[0:13:55] <iosephe> so, essentially, the more people know about the spoiler the more important it is to keep it a secret?
[0:13:59] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:13:59] <marvel877> Monday's Podcast is just gonna be called "Super Beast Cast - FINAL"

[0:16:07] <+SignScratch> maybe he never paid attention ever
[0:16:09] <+BusterRepukken> I dont understand why Woolie just doesn't wait for the eventual Clemps video rather than go through all this.
[0:16:10] <puse9> Woolie exposed
[0:16:10] <+JustToWatch> it's really gonna depend on if the rng favors Pat or not

[0:16:27] <Sporkgasm> can't pay attention to the story in case there's foreshadowing that spoils something
[0:16:28] <Profmcstevie> He blocked the word in his mind like blocking on twitter
[0:16:28] <%dankgerald> woolie rewires his brain to forget spoilers.
[0:16:29] <+glgzephyr> the final step is leaving stuff on your backlog FOREVER.

[0:19:38] <%Dementedpenguin> LUL
[0:19:39] <@SSaryn> NieR Replicant right now is a good one.
[0:19:40] <marvel877> NOOO, SPOILER OWL!
[0:19:40] <chaos2frozen> Romeo Must Die!
[0:19:40] <%ssjklyco> Don't forget the people who get mad when someone says if a media is good or bad casue they consider those as quality spoilers
[0:19:40] <rufus2k2> CRADLE 2 THE GRAVE
[0:19:43] <%saadi90> Alien and predator have sex
[0:19:44] <%dankgerald> oh god, I remember when people got on Pat's shit for 'spoiling' god of war
[0:19:45] <rufus2k2> NO THAT'S THE WRONG MOVIE
[0:19:48] <Profmcstevie> If you have the pleasure of not knowing about the events of something very popular, I will not ruin that
[0:19:51] <+PkSilent01> ROMEO DIED
[0:19:51] <%WhereIsWill> its cradle to the grave pat
[0:19:53] <%Das_Bass> John Dies in The end
[0:19:53] <puse9> Romeo must die LUL
[0:19:54] <%NitronStreams> ROMEO AND JULIET: 2.5 HD REMIX
[0:19:58] <marvel877> Cradle 2 the Grave
[0:19:59] <+eanscrale> It could be a subversion.
[0:19:59] <+SoySocks> Romeo + Juliet with Leo
[0:19:59] <yourliteraldog> Part 6 and 7 have been done for along time too tbh
[0:20:01] <+TheotherKristian> What the fuck, Romeo must die?!?!
[0:20:01] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> @BusterRepukken Woolie saw that people defended his decision to skip cutscenes on a stream where he specifically went in to experience the story content, and realized he hadn't gone far enough. He then decided to do a full reversal on his spoiler avoidance and get uber spoiled, breaking ToS and spoiler ethics to do so.
[0:20:01] <HeroToxiko> Cradle 2 the grave
[0:20:03] <rReizs> how about mercutio
[0:20:06] <+Kyma1020> That was Cradle 2 the Grave
[0:20:07] <%zeroarturia> It was Cradle 2 the Grave

[0:20:29] <%bravebravesrobin> Dude, Romeo and Juliet Romeo Must Die was the shit
[0:20:29] <%SaiyanShoto> Can I say "Bro you aren't ready for what's going to happen bro? You aren't ready bro"
[0:20:30] <%BoxNavy> yes
[0:20:34] <yourliteraldog> Spoilers in JoJo don't make any sense without context
[0:20:39] <@SSaryn> Like not spoiling key fights and shit
[0:20:39] <%Ranryu692> especially for things that were niche in their original release, but are getting widespread attention now
[0:20:41] <%Caped_Eggy> DMX is in romeo must die
[0:20:42] <DaKnightWarrior> yep
[0:20:42] <%chance_h> if something is complex enough, spoilers don't mean much
[0:20:43] <aeonicvector> part 6 means part 6 is spoilerish, but part 1-3 are 100% "safe" if theres no expectation they will watch
[0:20:46] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Juliet's Bizarre Adventure
[0:20:46] <%s1rcuit> I think that as long as there is some sort of spoiler warning in a semi-public setting it's fine, and if it's private, talk it out
[0:20:47] <%Dementedpenguin> Before the show was a thing, someone actually told me to skip Par 4 because it was filler. Like what the fuck.

[0:21:17] <HeroToxiko> I fucking love baz luhrmann's romeo + juliet, its rad
[0:21:17] <PanicSwytch> Hard and Fast
[0:21:21] <Profmcstevie> And more importantly, some people are only being born. How old something is is irrelevant if they had no ways to get to it
[0:21:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> Spoiler Templars are a pain in the ass
[0:21:26] <HeroToxiko> LUL
[0:21:30] <bob900000> I wonder who LUL

[0:21:40] <%ChestMimik> Spoilers: Spider-Man is in Spider-Man
[0:21:45] <%Monkeyweed21> Avoid trashing AoT's ending until the anime is finished
[0:21:47] <%dekkitout> So where do press releases of castings fall?
[0:21:49] <+allups> actors are fine cuz in some films that can be a spoiler
[0:21:51] <teh_Question> @KineticZen how DARE you
[0:21:53] <skyentombment> NO PAT, YOU HAVE TO DO EXACTLY THE SAME THING IN EVERY INSTANCE, NO NUISANCE
[0:21:56] <%Dakuu75> I'm lucky, I can get spoiled on shit and it won't effect my enjoyment, in the moment.
[0:21:57] <%aishman> I'm very much of "I really don't give a shit about spoilers. If you try not to spoil me I WILL SPOIL MYSELF JUST TELL ME ABOUT THE STORY"
[0:21:58] <%KineticZen> D:
[0:21:59] <%dekkitout> Thor 4, for example

[0:22:11] <Tracazoid> Goku gets a new Saiyan form, who could have guessed
[0:22:12] <laguerrilha> @GigaSeifer typo, i meant "Shouldnt spoil AoT"
[0:22:17] <%BoxNavy> NotLikeThis
[0:22:22] <%chance_h> i will never spoil Diavolos stand because idk how it work
[0:22:22] <+TheIrritableDespicable> People who care about spoilers are the same people who watch every trailer

[0:22:35] <%EsotericOdyssey> I've talked to people who considered it bad enough spoilers to not talk to me for a day that I mentioned a monster was coming to Monster Hunter World (it wasn't one of the elder dragons). Am I wrong or are they crazy? Cheer500
[0:22:36] <BeagleCypher> LUL
[0:22:36] <+PenmanLupine> when I imagine it, I picture a giant black man with moldy looking dread locks with terrible piercings  and a constant case of head ass

[0:24:00] <%bassoontyphoon> @DianaTheAscian Spoopy space stuff
[0:24:04] <Teras_ode> talking about a thing that shows up on screen is apparently spoilers to some people, like why the hell do these kinda people wanna ask others who know the source material what they think about the adaption if they are gonna scream spoilers about literally anything they say
[0:24:07] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:24:08] <marvel877> Can we talk about how the directors of some films get REALLY pissed at the trailer companies that spoil stuff in the trailers for their films? You can TELL Terminator 2 was shot to make it a twist that Arnold's the hero this time around.
[0:24:11] <%dekkitout> I can enjoy needles breaking my skin
[0:24:12] <Profmcstevie> Nice try I never had any

[0:24:24] <%czeekytv> Got my first dose today, arm is sore and im a little sleepy
[0:24:27] <Daxalog> What if I like being inside?
[0:24:27] <%BoxNavy> same
[0:24:28] <shieldecho> Same
[0:24:30] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt you should treat this game like the souls games and read the itens/enemy discriptions. there are some BONKERS stuff in there. Its real good
[0:24:32] <+trizetacannon44> Same
[0:24:32] <%dankgerald> i don't like it when you stare at the camera like that, you peer into the soul
[0:24:33] <LordOfThePoultry> same
[0:24:34] <%rcand9> good plan
[0:24:35] <@SSaryn> That's fair
[0:24:37] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Same
[0:24:39] <Profmcstevie> It's comfortable for me personally
[0:24:39] <%bassoontyphoon> Im excited for my second dose of the vaccine since itll making dying at work a lot harder
[0:24:39] <$Mekhet09> I'm going to fucking go into a restaurant and it in one. I've got a 5% chance I'll take it I'm sick of picking shit up.
[0:24:39] <Reanimator83> same
[0:24:40] <%dekkitout> Invest in a pretty neck gaiter
[0:24:40] <Zeif00> same
[0:24:40] <%aishman> Cons are gonna be fun.
[0:24:41] <%Jekado> i'm gonna go outside to get my vaccine then never again...

[0:24:41] <%bhp_99> same
[0:24:42] <%s1rcuit> I don't give a fuck about social norms, I just don't want to kill my dad
[0:24:44] <%Aeoneth> Its scary how comfortable I am in a mask nowadays
[0:24:44] <%Agami23> hey, you at least dont have people on your tv telling people to assault you for wearing a mask
[0:24:44] <%HitchhikingThrough> That's fair. Certainly keeping it on whenever I get sick
[0:24:45] <%hamborgini> got my second shot today, side effects so far are even more mild than the first shot
[0:24:48] <+CookieCutter007> Poo poo fart gas
[0:24:48] <silver__viii> it's nice to be able to hide half your face
[0:24:49] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt is the fear internalized?
[0:24:49] <fatalDestiny> Same, but I need to find a decent re-usable mask that doesn't fog my glasses to shit.
[0:24:51] <+impressionistcowboy> like 5 years from now? Legit curious
[0:24:52] <%CopperTucker> I will if I feel under the weather
[0:24:52] <shieldecho> I got my shot and my arm was a tiny bit sore for the second day and that was it
[0:24:52] <%JoshManVGH> It's protection from all the sick fucks our there! i haven't had a cold since this started!
[0:24:53] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt My brother graduated from boot camp as a Marine, going to be a combat engineer.
[0:24:53] <$Afterman_> yea
[0:24:54] <%blutzwavedave> I hope it becomes more common, tbh. I'll wear one if I ever have a cough or cold in the future. It just makes sense
[0:24:56] <bob900000> I don't care if people judge
[0:24:56] <%The_Gaming_Karp> got my 2nd dose today!
[0:24:57] <+KaneCube> It's like a security blanket at this point
[0:24:57] <$Afterman_> im probably also forever maskec

[0:24:59] <silvesky_silvers> tomatoMMM
[0:24:59] <%depressed_skeleton> i just bought some masks
[0:25:00] <puse9> the thought of going outside gives me the urge to bathe immediately
[0:25:01] <+BigChiefBear> Not getting sick rules
[0:25:02] <skyentombment> That sounds a bit extreme, but your circumstances are particular
[0:25:02] <$Afterman_> its not fear it caution
[0:25:03] <%jaybombdotcom> for sure not CONs
[0:25:03] <vnzuelandude> Airport 100%
[0:25:05] <%Caped_Eggy> Going to movies is overrated anyway
[0:25:08] <%CopperTucker> tbh mask wearing is good
[0:25:09] <+D00msDayDan> i'm gonna keep wearing my mask even after i get my second shot

[0:27:35] <%aishman> I actually love knowing the big twist a lot of times. It's weird cause it makes me excited to get to that point.
[0:27:36] <@commanderclaw> Spoiler Puritans
[0:27:36] <Sporkgasm> there's a length to which it's understandable, but some people take it to the deep end
[0:27:36] <%SirGO0SE> he glorious
[0:27:39] <KennySD> I watched DSP play returnal for funsies, he doesn’t even know what a rogue like is
[0:27:41] <$Mekhet09> A second game to get a ps5 for. Maybe in 3 years they'll end up with enough to buy one.

[0:27:43] <%neroforte177> there a certain point where spoiler shit goes too far

[0:28:09] <%weissguard> Elmo is perched perfectly
[0:28:10] <kasteni> The virgin consumer experience
[0:28:10] <marvel877> The Kingsmen Golden Circle director was PISSED the trailer company people spoiled the reveal one of the dead characters from the first film was alive.
[0:28:10] <%Raiden_Breaker> The worst spoiler I ever got was for MGSV as it gave me hope
[0:28:11] <%Ranryu692> I've never understood people who pick apart trailers
[0:28:11] <rufus2k2> End of the day, don't spoil something just to be a jackass

[0:28:12] <%dalmek> OCD where the D stands for daddy
[0:28:13] <+glgzephyr> @PatStaresAt For me, it's less of a *need* and more of a strong preference that I go into a movie, show, or video game unprimed so that all opinions are my own

[0:33:09] <Djinnazz> it's a roguelike...
[0:33:15] <+KaneCube> @PatStaresAt they fix that rest mode yet?
[0:33:15] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah you can just sleep mode
[0:33:19] <Astrophizz> but you can't play another game
[0:33:19] <%AzureGale> Yeah but the rest mode breaks sometimes
[0:33:20] <%Raiden_Breaker> Yeah Brad from Giant Bomb was talking about how that would break
[0:33:23] <%valriot> I dont trust the PS5 to do that
[0:33:23] <%Persona_EX> I can make one 👀
[0:33:26] <%Raiden_Breaker> early on
[0:33:28] <ExpressNode> It does?  Wish I had a PS5 so I can test that out
[0:33:28] <Astrophizz> other roguelikes have save and resume, no problem
[0:33:28] <@SSaryn> It's weird with it, you technically can't but oh there's ways around it and it's weird
[0:33:28] <%cache_22> People have had game crashes too, but that seems rare.
[0:33:28] <Profmcstevie> Apparently the playstation Rest mode is inconsistent??
[0:33:29] <%caramelatte1> Just bookmark your space
[0:33:29] <Karhax> isnt sleep mode unreliable?
[0:33:33] <%Dementedpenguin> "But it's gotta be saving MY way. DansGame "
[0:33:34] <puse9> it's a rogue like it's natural as breathing
[0:33:36] <+Dorf1> ps5 restmose is not trustworthy it shuts your shit down for no reason sometimes
[0:33:36] <chaosjoey> sounds nice for the later ports that will hopefully happen
[0:33:39] <+glgzephyr> You can go to rest mode and be fine, but you can't play another game in the middle of a run
[0:33:39] <%the38bandit> sleep is broke for some folks
[0:33:44] <@SSaryn> Also people genuinely want just like, a room to room save.
[0:33:46] <Teras_ode> "reeee someone knows more about a trivial thing in the big thing than I do before it was released, now my inferiority-surperiority complex is flaring up"
[0:33:50] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Game start
[0:33:54] <%blutzwavedave> She just needs a hat
[0:33:55] <%Monkeyweed21> they should bring back code saves
[0:33:57] <%JoshManVGH> Nice
[0:33:57] <puse9> a milf
[0:33:57] <%SaiyanShoto> I heard the rest mode issue was fixed with the previous upodates
[0:33:59] <%Dakuu75> Ripley from Alien 2 or 3
[0:33:59] <+walternatorz> She looks like Brienne
[0:33:59] <abuse_of_juice> yeah interesting character
[0:34:00] <%The_Gaming_Karp> She looks a little like Gwendoline Christie
[0:34:02] <@SSaryn> Like a regular ass girl who do a work
[0:34:04] <+senfood> That just makes her hotter.
[0:34:05] <leinadtonu> An older bikini model?
[0:34:06] <%Das_Bass> Janeway
[0:34:09] <+PenmanLupine> she looks like Conan O'Brien after insulting his ancestors
[0:34:09] <%dekkitout> This game is off to a good start
[0:34:12] <yourliteraldog> She kinda looks like one my professors
[0:34:12] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  she's voiced by Diana Burnwood in Hitman, see if you can catch it
[0:34:14] <Profmcstevie> She has a look of "friend of my mom" about her
[0:34:15] <Vyskus> like a real ass human being
[0:34:15] <marcdyllan> wtf did  i unmute too
[0:34:17] <%cache_22> There is an online mode?
[0:34:18] <%Raiden_Breaker> like a quick save is always nice
[0:34:19] <%valriot> Lesbian Mom
[0:34:19] <%THATGUY_789> put that on the box
[0:34:22] <Sporkgasm> L A R G E
[0:34:23] <%SaiyanShoto> I want them to fill the screen
[0:34:24] <%Raikouija> She looks 40
[0:34:25] <PanicSwytch> She looks like Breanne from Game of thrones
[0:34:25] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Older women are real hot though
[0:34:26] <%rcand9> chungus subs
[0:34:27] <abuse_of_juice> smoll
[0:34:28] <Louie_Salmon> I've heard that this game is a rad shooter/Metroid but kinda weak as a rogue-like, looking forward to see how it is
[0:34:28] <%caramelatte1> she looks like a really shitty manager i worked under lol
[0:34:29] <%Dakuu75> really? Are your eyes running it back? lol
[0:34:29] <%TheHairiestHare> disappointed aunt is my type
[0:34:30] <%the38bandit> how big is your tv again?
[0:34:32] <%Raikouija> And that’s a good thing
[0:34:33] <%JoshManVGH> @monkeyweed21 don't you bring that evil in here!
[0:34:34] <%AzureGale> Can't wait for the scene where Selene says "English (US)"
[0:34:43] <Louie_Salmon> Oh hey it literally says it there
[0:34:44] <+abrupt_abe> The rumble in this is amazing
[0:34:47] <+glgzephyr> Online mode lets you interact with other players' bloodstains
[0:34:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> Let's play a video game
[0:34:54] <@SSaryn> I can't wait to turn the Adaptive Triggers off when I get this.
[0:34:55] <marvel877> You're gonna want to change the controls to CLASSIC.
[0:35:01] <rufus2k2> this game has great enemy design
[0:35:01] <%dekkitout> "This game IS hard, so don't do an op ed on this, piss babies"
[0:35:02] <%ChestMimik> "Get fucked" - Devs
[0:35:03] <puse9> @patstaresat dont forget to change button layout to make your life easier
[0:35:06] <+D00msDayDan> remember the triggers on the gamecube controller?
[0:35:07] <aiutare47> “It’s supposed to be hard piss babies”
[0:35:08] <Vyskus> babbies first roguelite
[0:35:08] <+glgzephyr> STAR WARS
[0:35:10] <Sapphire_Breeze> is this Alien
[0:35:10] <OkamiDude15> @AzureGale its a very emotional scene
[0:35:11] <%SaiyanShoto> Is there a difference between Rougelite and rougelike?
[0:35:11] <%maenos2> THE DEAD SPEAK
[0:35:11] <Reanimator83> Really like the control function in this game
[0:35:12] <laguerrilha> space. the final frontier
[0:35:14] <%blutzwavedave> STAR WARS?!?!
[0:35:15] <%Order_of_Mystery> "Small is fine." ~Paige, years ago
[0:35:19] <%Monkeyweed21> She looks your Auntie that never got married but is still doing well for herself
[0:35:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> SPACE
[0:35:22] <$Ziegsy> Pat: 'This is a game'
[0:35:22] <%rcand9> it pretty
[0:35:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> THE FINAL FRONTIER
[0:35:23] <+Dorf1> having permanent progression at all means its not a rougelike
[0:35:24] <%Ranryu692> that lack of save & quit is fine if runs aren't that long
[0:35:26] <%SirGO0SE> it do tho
[0:35:27] <%skizzuto> You mean the nighttime
[0:35:28] <%dalmek> probably my favourite concept
[0:35:28] <Yakobro> @PatStaresAt it's just night time
[0:35:29] <Profmcstevie> Space nightmares
[0:35:29] <+glgzephyr> THAT SURE IS A STRONG THEME
[0:35:29] <leinadtonu> it do be fucked up
[0:35:30] <%the38bandit> Damn space, you scare
[0:35:30] <@SSaryn> Usually
[0:35:31] <%Raikouija> @ssaryn haha handgun trigger go brrr
[0:35:31] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Space is pretty spooky
[0:35:32] <%blutzwavedave> @Order_of_Mystery LUL LUL
[0:35:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yes, this is a game
[0:35:34] <%blastyoboots> Making the game lose your run when the console powers off is pretty lazy though.
[0:35:38] <%Raiden_Breaker> if your power goes out, damn that 2hr progress is gone
[0:35:39] <%SirGO0SE> remember space is just night time
[0:35:40] <+johnnychopsocky> the adaptive triggers are actually pretty good in this
[0:35:41] <abuse_of_juice> nice graphics
[0:35:42] <Astrophizz> Solaris vibes
[0:35:42] <Djinnazz> @PatStaresAt Oh yeah,m this takes FULL advantage of the haptic
[0:35:42] <Alzero83> Brianne of Tarth
[0:35:44] <+Grizwaldus> I made it in time
[0:35:44] <+SeventhVice> Don’t ever put down the controller
[0:35:45] <Tracazoid> Space be fucked, just like being a robot at the bottom of the ocean
[0:35:45] <Vyskus> space do be fucked up
[0:35:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> @PatStaresAt You should watch The Expanse
[0:35:49] <+johnnychopsocky> don't have to death grip them
[0:35:49] <%SaiyanShoto> Put the rumble on your orb
[0:35:50] <%Bailey__gaming> I its just nightime
[0:35:54] <%Dakuu75> I been using my new PS5 controller for PC games. the RUmble is really good. I recomend it over the PS4 controller
[0:35:55] <+RootVeggie> Did you know, there is a planet out there where it rains glass?
[0:35:55] <%bassoontyphoon> this looks really good
[0:35:57] <%psidefx> Whiter shadow~
[0:35:57] <+Grizwaldus> such good rumblies
[0:35:58] <%valriot> Still dont like that it uses a rest mode, it feels like one of those "Hey hey push our console features" when a Save has worked forever
[0:35:59] <Teras_ode> when the space is actually "alien"
[0:35:59] <%Raikouija> I mean, space is fucked up
[0:35:59] <%JoshManVGH> Approach FORBIDDEN!
[0:36:00] <captainnathaniel> you really wanna read all of the lore stuff you find. it is worth it
[0:36:00] <rufus2k2> HUEY LOOK OUT
[0:36:02] <+michingmallecho> Imagine having the air in your lungs exploding in space…that’s why I couldn’t see Gravity
[0:36:04] <karovus> space? oh you mean nighttime
[0:36:08] <+glgzephyr> the rumble in this game is next level.
[0:36:10] <BentArcher> Why does like 90% of Sci Fi takes place at night?
[0:36:10] <%s1rcuit> White Shadow is Space Klan
[0:36:11] <rReizs> wow the planet actually looks big compared to the ship in this game
[0:36:14] <%rottingpastry> Do you see the white shadow?
[0:36:14] <%holydeviant1> @Tracazoid dont lose that coinflip
[0:36:15] <$Ziegsy> Dont put the rumble on your head. It does wierd shit
[0:36:16] <+glgzephyr> IT SURE DOES HUH
[0:36:17] <Louie_Salmon> @saiyanshoto Like has no progression between runs, lite has long term progression and objective upgrades
[0:36:18] <%Blackleafx> thats uhn ayyyyyylieeen
[0:36:18] <%Agami23> is this prometheus?
[0:36:22] <Qsmash_> you're gonna be saying that the whole time Pat
[0:36:23] <yourliteraldog> Space is pretty fucked up. Even mundane shit like physics can kill you.
[0:36:24] <%rcand9> straight up
[0:36:25] <+Grizwaldus> The Rumblies
[0:36:26] <%czeekytv> @michingmallecho Gravity was really anxiety-inducing
[0:36:28] <+BIumen> does she start out with heterochromia or no
[0:36:29] <+solzan2000> lol
[0:36:29] <+KaneCube> Too bad Paige cant watch this, due to the Space

[0:36:41] <%bassoontyphoon> sipsipElmo sipsipElmo sipsipElmo
[0:36:42] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> If space wasn't meant to be scary, then why is it black?                          --Racists probably, I thought of the joke and had to say it I am very sorry everyone
[0:36:44] <ExpressNode> I've read some news articles saying that this game "pushes the PS5 to its limits" or along those lines.
[0:36:45] <%rcand9> elmo
[0:36:45] <$Mekhet09> Would paige die just watching the intro?

[0:36:54] <+NYCrownlessKing> Elmo: PET ME

[0:37:07] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Her eyes are different
[0:37:08] <+walternatorz> heterochromia
[0:37:08] <%bassoontyphoon> @Mekhet09 Paige would be upset that she couldnt merc the protagonist
[0:37:10] <42nfl19> is that the twist? we fucked up earth again?
[0:37:11] <Louie_Salmon> Was that heterochromia?
[0:37:11] <%cache_22> Heterochromia, she's a protagonist.
[0:37:14] <%Das_Bass> SPOILER: this game takes place in space
[0:37:16] <puse9> omg this is alien

[0:37:30] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Heterochromia is cool
[0:37:30] <%greasypete00> hard to find
[0:37:30] <%dekkitout> Sony Exclusive Bingo, mark off heterochromia
[0:37:32] <%Dakuu75> @Louie_Salmon each eye a different color
[0:37:33] <%depressed_skeleton> I can't believe Pat is a nerd
[0:37:34] <+glgzephyr> it's trauma-induced heterochromia =)

[0:37:39] <rufus2k2> that framing with the zoom ins reminds me of Battlestar Galactica
[0:37:41] <+TheotherKristian> What are the possibilities that she's just deeply concussed and that all this rogue like gameplay is all in her head?
[0:37:44] <%valriot> She has the Sharingan
[0:37:44] <+RootVeggie> SHE'S AN AL BHEN

[0:38:10] <+TheIrritableDespicable> Go in the shop!
[0:38:10] <%Mendin> Selene means Moon Goddess. Helios means Sun God. Astra means star

[0:38:20] <Louie_Salmon> That is FAST
[0:38:23] <%W1nterTitan> DAMN SHE MOVES FAST

[0:38:30] <doggieo> Metroid vibes
[0:38:30] <%bassoontyphoon> DAMN SHES FAST
[0:38:32] <hairtoday> that's a good sprint
[0:38:33] <+glgzephyr> @Dakuu75 No idea, but it's in her ship's files on her
[0:38:34] <Alzero83> Turn the Controller setting to CLassic @PatStaresAt
[0:38:35] <%valriot> I miss Metroid so much, its not fair
[0:38:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> Sprint is fast
[0:38:39] <+Grizwaldus> Triggers are fun
[0:38:40] <SomeAsianDood> Yeah the movement in this game is fast. You'll see why real fast
[0:38:41] <+ZweihanderSteve> half press iirc
[0:38:44] <cervidaequus> Zoomies
[0:38:44] <%Dementedpenguin> She channeled her inner Samus with that sprint
[0:38:47] <%AzureGale> The alt fire controls in this game are weird
[0:38:47] <marvel877> SWITCH TO CLASSIC
[0:38:48] <ivanmistwalker> BLAZING Sprint
[0:38:50] <+solzan2000> adaptive is cool
[0:38:53] <Louie_Salmon> That seems much more natural
[0:38:53] <%rottingpastry> try it so you can change it immediately
[0:38:53] <%cache_22> Do we need to see the entire bottom corner or is Pat covering something up?
[0:38:55] <%YakumoYomi> @RootVeggie Praise be to Yevon, brudda
[0:38:57] <Deceptimus> Feels like Metroid Prime, Somehow...
[0:38:58] <%Quigsies> The adaptive triggers in this game are cool
[0:39:07] <%SirGO0SE> she shmoovin
[0:39:08] <+solzan2000> peeps so stuck in their ways lol
[0:39:09] <+johnnychopsocky> the adaptive triggers are good in this.  not like Resi8
[0:39:10] <%listopat> adaptive is pretty cool in this imo
[0:39:13] <%rottingpastry> health and ability cooldowns it doesn't matter
[0:39:13] <%AzureGale> Also that map
[0:39:14] <Ipsenscastle> I have no idea why they thought people would get behind their horrible control scheme
[0:39:14] <+glgzephyr> The map is literally a MP map
[0:39:17] <Teras_ode> 3d map looks metroidy
[0:39:19] <+solzan2000> ^
[0:39:20] <marvel877> Look at this Metroid Prime ass Metroid Prime game.
[0:39:21] <%KeiganOfAstora> Yea this is Metroid Prime

[0:39:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> Tallon IV Overworld
[0:39:24] <%Raikouija> Adaptive triggers!!!
[0:39:26] <+TheotherKristian> This honestly reminded me more of recore, but with lots more money
[0:39:27] <%valriot> It has the Gamecube trigger thing
[0:39:30] <%Agami23> i dont know why but this reminds me of death stranding
[0:39:32] <silver__viii> oh this is pretty cool
[0:39:34] <%aishman> WOW this game looks fucking RAD
[0:39:36] <Teras_ode> oh yeah metroid

[0:39:55] <%blutzwavedave> Abandoning Helios, heading to Tutorial Area

[0:40:08] <Teras_ode> is this a GOOD OtherM?
[0:40:08] <+BIumen> arent any civilizations you find in space a xeno-type?
[0:40:08] <causewaybob> I may becoming influenced
[0:40:11] <yourliteraldog> Count down to HR Gieger inspired designs
[0:40:12] <%0dokuro> Just got done playing a few hours of this, pretty good so far.
[0:40:14] <%rcand9> money game
[0:40:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> xeno you say?!
[0:40:16] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> What if Metroid, but Samus was 48 and really didn't want to be doing Space anymore?
[0:40:17] <tyrell42> wishi could stay and watch but i have a trip to visit family tomorrow and it's 1 am here, Hope you enjoy pat
[0:40:20] <+glgzephyr> THEIR MEMES HAVE SURVIVED
[0:40:20] <%Mendin> Is this Mortal Shell?
[0:40:22] <+walternatorz> I thought they just copied and pasted Control and added space suits.
[0:40:26] <%THATGUY_789> Xeno warrior Princess
[0:40:27] <%BoxNavy> Oboe lite
[0:40:29] <%Arancet> obolite is $$$$
[0:40:31] <%saadi90> Sony do be like that
[0:40:32] <SomeAsianDood> LODSOMONY
[0:40:33] <Reanimator83> Playing this with headphones Kreygasm the sound design is really good
[0:40:34] <Ipsenscastle> they pushed lots of coins through the cd tray and this game came out
[0:40:35] <+RootVeggie> I'm guessing this probably isn't first contact with alien artifacts
[0:40:35] <%rottingpastry> "obol"-ite
[0:40:36] <Sapphire_Breeze> chiral energy?
[0:40:39] <+D00msDayDan> apply money directly to game
[0:40:45] <+TheotherKristian> What if Samus was stuck in Groundhogs Day scenario?
[0:40:46] <%Raikouija> Waiting for an engineer corpse to pop up
[0:40:48] <%Agami23> for some reason it grows out of the ground like a hand
[0:40:52] <+Dova573> sony does what nintendont?
[0:40:53] <+AWanderingKenku> Weren't Obols the currency in ancient Greece used to ferry the dead across the Styx?
[0:41:01] <%Mendin> yEP
[0:41:05] <%Raikouija> THATS A PRIME DATALOG
[0:41:06] <%rottingpastry> it's gold. that's why it's gold.
[0:41:07] <%Raikouija> DA FUCK
[0:41:11] <+glgzephyr> @walternatorz I would say that this feels better to play than Control and also has a totally different tone. Not that Control felt bad. This is just great
[0:41:12] <balthazar758> also known as obolit in the streets
[0:41:17] <+solzan2000> she somewhat has an ass at least
[0:41:19] <cervidaequus> Gold crystals like the death stranding
[0:41:20] <%bravebravesrobin> This might be the closest thing to a Event Horizon esque horror game that we're going to get since Dead Space ended
[0:41:21] <%0dokuro> It looks like eldritch space horrors, but plays like Nier with guns.
[0:41:21] <%rottingpastry> it me
[0:41:24] <Ipsenscastle> it you
[0:41:24] <%BoxNavy> D:
[0:41:27] <%cache_22> monkaS How can this be?

[0:41:33] <%WhereIsWill> wild
[0:41:33] <%JoshManVGH> It's  yoooooooy
[0:41:34] <ivanmistwalker> CLONES!
[0:41:35] <%s1rcuit> gold minerals AND an older woman who may die multiple times? Paige's ears are pricking up
[0:41:36] <+glgzephyr> I'm in a roguelike!?
[0:41:36] <%blutzwavedave> IT'S ME AUSTIN
[0:41:37] <%Blackleafx> NotLikeThis
[0:41:38] <OkamiDude15> how CAN this be?
[0:41:39] <+JJsAdventure> kdubS
[0:41:41] <%dekkitout> We were the xenos all along D:
[0:41:41] <Louie_Salmon> And something fucked you up
[0:41:43] <%RoggleJr> Oh my.
[0:41:43] <%Mendin> Get it we're in Greco-Roman Space Mythology
[0:41:43] <+covo375> The call's coming from inside the house!
[0:41:44] <%AzureGale> Get da pistol
[0:41:45] <Alzero83> I am the Dead
[0:41:47] <%KeiganOfAstora> whoa
[0:41:52] <%rottingpastry> any game that opens with a grandfather paradox gets my vote
[0:41:53] <%baka_sugoi> gun
[0:41:53] <+solzan2000> nice take on the loop
[0:41:53] <%Blackleafx> HEAVENS SENT VIBES
[0:41:54] <$Raikouija> That’s me!!!
[0:41:55] <BlueBiscuitGT> Her voice makes me think of Ripley, she's got that smart but tired lady voice
[0:41:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> But how?
[0:41:59] <LordOfThePoultry> oh no
[0:41:59] <%psidefx> She was always here ALWAYS HAS BEEn\
[0:42:00] <%blastyoboots> Oh SHIT that said 1% research progress ON that item, that means the log for that item description will get BIGGER :D :D
[0:42:00] <%chance_h> it's your cousin that didn't wamt to go bowling
[0:42:01] <+Dova573> is this Requiem?
[0:42:01] <+glgzephyr> it certainly is weird.
[0:42:01] <%0dokuro> Already in the simulation
[0:42:06] <%W1nterTitan> We're not the starting Selene
[0:42:06] <AoiRob> is this a strand type game
[0:42:06] <+glgzephyr> Or this isn't your first loop
[0:42:06] <Louie_Salmon> Or we didn't get to see the first couple
[0:42:07] <%skizzuto> that or we're not witnessing the first loop
[0:42:08] <%Raiden_Breaker> so original her is dead
[0:42:08] <+RootVeggie> Now cannibalize your corpse
[0:42:08] <Phlaminngooo> There's like a loop within a loop and I love it
[0:42:10] <%JoshManVGH> You're already caught in a timeloop
[0:42:10] <%Ranryu692> or this just isn't the first loop
[0:42:11] <%Blackleafx> Hey Pat, you don't watch Dr Who right? There was a REALLY good episode with a time loop like that
[0:42:11] <%hamborgini> or the arrival is part of the time loop
[0:42:11] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> The only way to avoid dying is to kill yourself right now! Take that time-loop!!
[0:42:13] <Daxalog> Hows it feel!?
[0:42:15] <ThDark> I mean, she 'woke up' after the crash, but only from our perspective
[0:42:17] <+Shonen_hero> Diavolo save her
[0:42:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> It started before it started before it started BEFORE it started
[0:42:21] <+walternatorz> you've just been ground hogging it for billions of years by now
[0:42:31] <SomeAsianDood> ACTIVE RELOAD LETS GO
[0:42:37] <Teras_ode> infact you started playing the game before you started playing the game
[0:42:37] <+johnnychopsocky> can hold RT to fire all weapons
[0:42:40] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> He just wants to show off his ring
[0:42:46] <+RootVeggie> Jesus it still feels kinda weird seeing a ring on Pat's finger
[0:42:47] <+glgzephyr> it'
[0:42:48] <%Broand> Is that a goddamn active reload
[0:42:56] <Sapphire_Breeze> cool ring
[0:42:57] <+PenmanLupine> @PatStaresAt if you like that idea you should check out Into the Tall Grass on Netflix. It's a Stephen King movie with a similar idea and a stupid ending in Stephen King style.
[0:42:57] <%Raikouija> It’s like Mario sunshine, hold the button halfway to do shit
[0:42:57] <ivanmistwalker> Returnal Requiem!!
[0:42:58] <+glgzephyr> it's impossible to make out without adjusting your camera focus
[0:43:01] <%SaiyanShoto> look at those baby hands
[0:43:03] <%0dokuro> I honestly didnt even realize the controller could do that before playing this game.
[0:43:05] <+solzan2000> the left one feels soo gud
[0:43:06] <+walternatorz> chunky
[0:43:08] <%cache_22> So, it's like the GameCube controller, got it.
[0:43:08] <+JJsAdventure> yea i thought my back triggers were broke for a sec
[0:43:10] <+TheotherKristian> Gosh, this sure would be easier to see if you had a camera that wasn't made in 1993
[0:43:10] <%rottingpastry> it is clear
[0:43:10] <bob900000> yup
[0:43:13] <%bmoral64> I understood
[0:43:16] <%za7az> Made sense Pat
[0:43:17] <yourliteraldog> Feels good sounds like the bottom line
[0:43:19] <%valriot> Gamecube
[0:43:23] <abuse_of_juice> u did good pat
[0:43:23] <%rottingpastry> there is
[0:43:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> yea
[0:43:28] <theshillman> yes pat we saw your ring the lord may look the other way but we see your thot-ish ways
[0:43:28] <Louie_Salmon> Control style?
[0:43:29] <%Raiden_Breaker> This is cool on shooters that are not multiplayer and not repative
[0:43:32] <+RootVeggie> Control reloading
[0:43:33] <+glgzephyr> it a control with active reloiad
[0:43:34] <%Ranryu692> oh I hate that
[0:43:36] <%Blackleafx> Is it mass effect rules?
[0:43:38] <+johnnychopsocky> this game is very Control
[0:43:40] <%shurtal> Gears of war reload system
[0:43:41] <+allups> yeah i always thought we ddint need reload buttons
[0:43:42] <+TheIrritableDespicable> it's like control but with a mechanic for reload
[0:43:42] <pth88> gears of war reloading
[0:43:43] <Alzero83> Quick Reload if you time it right
[0:43:44] <%Raikouija> Gamecube analog triggers, REBORN
[0:43:44] <%Monkeyweed21> there is an active reload
[0:43:44] <puse9> active reload
[0:43:45] <%KeiganOfAstora> infinite ammo?
[0:43:46] <Calek> gears of war realoding
[0:43:49] <theshillman> pat, active reload
[0:43:50] <%Arancet> it has Gears' active reload
[0:43:52] <balthazar758> gun

[0:44:09] <+michingmallecho> NOICE
[0:44:10] <+glgzephyr> it gets better LUL
[0:44:11] <$Ziegsy> can you dodge reload?
[0:44:11] <%HitchhikingThrough> Active reload PogChamp
[0:44:12] <Phlaminngooo> I played like 4 loops before realizing I was looking at an active reload cause it's so uncommon now
[0:44:17] <Dunmarkh> a teste
[0:44:17] <%Raiden_Breaker> More games need GoW reloading for thing
[0:44:20] <causewaybob> This one of them there money games
[0:44:21] <+wmeldrum> i love active reload
[0:44:28] <Louie_Salmon> Free ammo, but also skill-based, best of both worlds
[0:44:30] <%rottingpastry> jam it in your suit holes
[0:44:31] <%depressed_skeleton> Eat it
[0:44:32] <Teras_ode> the real gun triggers that I've experienced weren't that loose
[0:44:33] <%s1rcuit> it even has MP scanning
[0:44:36] <%Mendin> more Mortal Shell style item logs
[0:44:39] <BlueBiscuitGT> Super Fungus
[0:44:41] <+glgzephyr> I love these descriptions
[0:44:41] <iosephe> they could just call it a fungus
[0:44:45] <%blastyoboots> @patstaresat YEAH the more of them you pick up the more the log entry fills in Pat!

[0:46:45] <%dekkitout> Style meters johnstonePog
[0:46:49] <xanerts> is this one of those games where the MC never shuts up?
[0:46:51] <%Dementedpenguin> Yup, definitely a Housemarque game.
[0:46:53] <%goose_attack_almanac> They burst into worms
[0:46:54] <+Double_Tap_That> Perfect play bonus
[0:46:54] <AoiRob> Control
[0:46:55] <%za7az> @smallboops What a horrifying thought. How many times would you have to die...?

[0:47:59] <Daxalog> Like some form of Procedurall generationning?
[0:48:02] <%s1rcuit> spoopy
[0:48:02] <+ratreborn> oh ok
[0:48:04] <42nfl19> is this the first run?
[0:48:04] <Phlaminngooo> The fact it doesn't play immediately can by slightly offputting
[0:48:07] <+Grizwaldus> Apply Money Directly to the Game
[0:48:08] <Louie_Salmon> Wait so this previous Selene knew about the loops, but now THIS one doesn't?
[0:48:09] <+glgzephyr> it's EVERYWHERE
[0:48:11] <buttesr> She said it she said the thing
[0:48:13] <%Quigsies> Housemarque based
[0:48:15] <%the22cstomp> this looks really fucking cool
[0:48:17] <%rottingpastry> when you pull up the menu you can see rain running down the screen
[0:48:17] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Might this be...A Good Game?!
[0:48:20] <+solzan2000> they stepped their game up
[0:48:20] <Alzero83> Max compared it to Solaris @PatStaresAt
[0:48:21] <%rcand9> MONEY
[0:48:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> Really good?
[0:48:22] <+ratreborn> my store didnt have it when i got off work :(
[0:48:22] <%Bailey__gaming> psaBig psaBig money
[0:48:23] <Calek> Kerberon aka good boy
[0:48:24] <%Mathochism> What's up with these Finnish studios and their presentation?
[0:48:26] <+RootVeggie> Keberos!
[0:48:26] <+chrispunchesboulder> Do you mean that in a good or bad way?
[0:48:27] <%Blackleafx> KomodoHype
[0:48:28] <yourliteraldog> Or tom hanks death loop movie that movie was renamed like 3 times
[0:48:28] <mattdaddyd101> MONEY
[0:48:29] <+glgzephyr> GET IT IT'S LIKE KERBERUS
[0:48:29] <vile_brand> its moon-presence
[0:48:31] <+johnnychopsocky> this game is Big Big Big Atmosphere
[0:48:33] <%AzureGale> Are they good in bed too
[0:48:37] <Teras_ode> hentai doggo
[0:48:38] <+AWanderingKenku> There are so many Greek myth references
[0:48:40] <%Raikouija> Explode with money this game
[0:48:40] <%Mendin> @Louie_Salmon Presumably past!Selene got to that spot later in the loop due to the rearrangement
[0:48:41] <%bassoontyphoon> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:48:42] <%valriot> Gives me Prey vibes as well
[0:48:45] <AoiRob> pupy
[0:48:48] <%Caped_Eggy> Plant base crocs monkaS
[0:48:50] <%0dokuro> Playing it felt like playing Nier trapped in the Binding of Issac with Gears of War reloading mechanics.
[0:48:54] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt mid game these descriptions become CRAZY
[0:48:56] <DaKnightWarrior> Cool monster.
[0:48:57] <Deceptimus> What I'm curious about, is why you can't remember your earlier loops. But you seem to be able to remember every loop from now.
[0:49:00] <+glgzephyr> I love how people see ANY tentacles and are like IT'S BLOODBORNE.
[0:49:04] <42nfl19> is this a new studio @patstaresat or an old one?
[0:49:16] <%the22cstomp> is this housmarque's first fully 3d game?
[0:49:19] <%Freddy253> old
[0:49:22] <%Arancet> pick it up!
[0:49:22] <Astrophizz> @Mathochism Remedy and Housemarque both come from the oldschool demo scene
[0:49:23] <+Panic_at_the_Discord> i'm [PARSING ERROR]ing myself right now
[0:49:23] <%rottingpastry> pick it up?
[0:49:24] <%Quigsies> pat pick it up
[0:49:25] <%Arancet> you didnt pick it up
[0:49:26] <+Grizwaldus> Pick it up
[0:49:26] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Didnt pick up
[0:49:27] <%radda343> you didn't pick it up
[0:49:27] <ThDark> Didn't... pick up the key?
[0:49:28] <Calek> did he pick it up
[0:49:29] <%MrBorisMakarov> pick it up
[0:49:30] <%OdeToKale> pick the key up!
[0:49:31] <Astrophizz> @42nfl19 old studio
[0:49:32] <sirrice77> pat pick up
[0:49:32] <$Ziegsy> Hey chat, whats this games epilepsy status?
[0:49:33] <puse9> Pat. you left the key
[0:49:34] <ivanmistwalker> PICK IT
[0:49:35] <%CalderGaming> @42nfl19 Housemarque has been around since the 90s
[0:49:38] <+TheotherKristian> Gumbo, the sony game standard
[0:49:41] <AoiRob> PICK
[0:49:47] <%Psykoknight65> gives you extra projectiles I know
[0:49:49] <%rottingpastry> did you know that you left the key behind tho?
[0:49:50] <%cache_22> It's cool that items are shown on the minimap.
[0:49:51] <+TheIrritableDespicable> your stacked buffs show up in the bottom left
[0:49:55] <+johnnychopsocky> I do wonder if Remedy chipped in anything to Housemarque on this, given their proximity
[0:49:57] <user_naim> How long we been playing?
[0:50:00] <+Grizwaldus> Dripping Money
[0:50:00] <%AzureGale> Love  a good air dash
[0:50:09] <%OdeToKale> lvl 1 is enhanced reload
[0:50:10] <+BusterRepukken> insert thing Pat already knows here
[0:50:16] <%arcielardor> adrenaline means more buffs, higher level better buff
[0:50:17] <Djinnazz> @PatStaresAt Dash length is on how long you hold it down.
[0:50:17] <%Caped_Eggy> That gate disappeared way to quick
[0:50:17] <Kaleidoscope_Misfortune> 10 min
[0:50:24] <Louie_Salmon> The sprint and dash are such crazy mobility, I'm scared of the bullet patterns you're gonna face
[0:50:25] <Calek> I changed dash to R1, felt more comfortable
[0:50:26] <%jorniev> sooooo returnal... what is it like?
[0:50:32] <yourliteraldog> I FRAMES
[0:50:41] <+eanscrale> It's a graze
[0:50:42] <+Shonen_hero> Oh I liked that
[0:50:44] <%HitchhikingThrough> @jorniev we don't know yet
[0:50:45] <+glgzephyr> OH LOOK AT THAT ADRENALINE TUTORIAL, THAT'S IMPORTANT @PatStaresAt
[0:50:45] <%rottingpastry> it like a returnal
[0:50:58] <%AzureGale> Exploshit
[0:50:58] <%Raikouija> Bayo Dodge?!?
[0:50:58] <SomeAsianDood> its a heart piece Pog
[0:51:01] <OkamiDude15> @glgzephyr he read it already
[0:51:03] <Louie_Salmon> @jorniev Seems like Nier Control Metroid
[0:51:05] <%s1rcuit> chat, random question: would playing Nier Automata spoil anything for Replicant?
[0:51:05] <Ipsenscastle> @johnnychopsocky my theory is they use a lot of the same talent pool at different stages of development
[0:51:17] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I blame it on space
[0:51:17] <%Monkeyweed21> ENERGY TANK
[0:51:20] <%BoxNavy> a piss of heart
[0:51:20] <AoiRob> @s1rcuit ALL of it
[0:51:27] <%Arancet> you can dash through the laser
[0:51:27] <OkamiDude15> @s1rcuit yes
[0:51:28] <+glgzephyr> @OkamiDude15 Oh, that's strange. He remarked on Adrenaline very recently like he didn't know what it was.
[0:51:30] <%arcielardor> dash through
[0:51:31] <+TheIrritableDespicable> dash through laser
[0:51:31] <%rottingpastry> tutorial hard
[0:51:32] <%Quigsies> dash through!
[0:51:32] <BlueBiscuitGT> Nier Metroid is actually the perfect tagline to this game
[0:51:32] <Alzero83> Parry thru
[0:51:32] <yourliteraldog> High Concept Metriod and schmup
[0:51:33] <Dunmarkh> shits locked
[0:51:37] <+johnnychopsocky> dash it
[0:51:38] <ThDark> Immune damage boost tho
[0:51:39] <%s1rcuit> noted, thanks guys
[0:51:40] <%radda343> try dashing thru
[0:51:41] <captainnathaniel> dash
[0:51:43] <%arcielardor> you gotta dash through
[0:51:44] <%Agami23> can you dash through?
[0:51:44] <puse9> dash through
[0:51:46] <+glgzephyr> nope
[0:51:47] <%blastyoboots> is there a place for a key?
[0:51:51] <+dante_must_die_exe> yeye iframes
[0:51:55] <user_naim> @kaleidoscope_misfortune thanks
[0:51:55] <%rottingpastry> also she could literally just walk between them but whatever
[0:51:56] <%Agami23> i frames, dope
[0:51:59] <Alzero83> That statue is looking at you funny @PatStaresAt
[0:52:05] <%BoxNavy> i like the ambient music
[0:52:13] <%Arancet> yeeeep
[0:52:16] <Phlaminngooo> It is not pat
[0:52:17] <%valriot> LUL LUL
[0:52:24] <Louie_Salmon> Oh god I would reset if I took damage
[0:52:25] <%rottingpastry> oh no fall down
[0:52:26] <Calek> this is just metroid music I love it
[0:52:32] <%jorniev> what planet is she on?
[0:52:32] <%Arancet> statues with yellow eyes contain money
[0:52:38] <BlueBiscuitGT> @BoxNavy sound design in general so far is great
[0:52:40] <+johnnychopsocky> only sorta.  Nier rules, some projectiles can't be dashed through
[0:52:40] <Reanimator83> You can also brighten your crosshair in the option if you think it's to low
[0:52:50] <yourliteraldog> Can you hover bet thats an upgrade
[0:52:52] <%rottingpastry> just shoot things that look like they should be shot
[0:52:52] <+glgzephyr> no you have not
[0:52:57] <abuse_of_juice> this looks WAY more interesting than it did in the reveal trailer
[0:52:59] <%rottingpastry> that is the gameplays
[0:52:59] <Calek> shoot the penis in the statue so they die
[0:53:00] <%BoxNavy> yeah kill his penis off
[0:53:01] <%Arancet> not yet
[0:53:03] <%greasypete00> and he falls over just like in real life
[0:53:04] <+AWanderingKenku> This game makes me really wish I could get my hands on a PS5
[0:53:05] <%acridpaladin> the structural weak point. the benis
[0:53:07] <%AzureGale> That's a metaphor for getting hit in the dick
[0:53:09] <Teras_ode> rip dick
[0:53:16] <+glgzephyr> shoot the orb eventually
[0:53:23] <ThDark> Shooting the statue in the dick causes it to die, further data required
[0:53:25] <%Agami23> if the game was cool you'd shoot the legs to make the statue fall on enemies
[0:53:28] <%rcand9> chat got excited early?
[0:53:29] <Deceptimus> @AzureGale What's the meta for?
[0:53:30] <SomeAsianDood> they don't like it huh. Just like real people
[0:53:32] <+johnnychopsocky> huh, never thought to blast that statues for fun and profit
[0:53:32] <%bmoral64> That dash animation is a little weird
[0:53:41] <iosephe> Active reload, got it
[0:53:44] <+solzan2000> I heard they started increasing the production of PS5s now
[0:53:46] <+BusterRepukken> roading
[0:53:48] <%rcand9> roted
[0:53:52] <+StatesmanPrimal> damn this game is pretty
[0:53:59] <8th_nel> @PatStaresAt how do your hands feel ? are they immersed ?
[0:54:00] <%rottingpastry> does it do anything if you get it in a particular bit of the meter?
[0:54:07] <+glgzephyr> don't you just love how the enemies light themselves up for you
[0:54:08] <Teras_ode> we bullet hell now
[0:54:13] <AoiRob> what if ONiieR-chan had a GUN
[0:54:16] <%jorniev> i heard this is a whatchamacallit... like hades?
[0:54:21] <+StatesmanPrimal> we touhou now
[0:54:27] <%AzureGale> @Deceptimus Maximizing damage. Like aiming for the dick
[0:54:28] <LoneFonte> Roguelike
[0:54:33] <+D00msDayDan> yeah it's a hades-like
[0:54:33] <Astrophizz> Touhou has come a long way
[0:54:37] <+glgzephyr> Roguelite*
[0:54:39] <%jorniev> rouguelike!
[0:54:40] <%Maids4lyfe> bad
[0:54:42] <ThDark> @jorniev A videogame?
[0:54:50] <%Maids4lyfe> purple hurts you
[0:54:52] <abuse_of_juice> fauxguelike
[0:54:54] <%Maids4lyfe> it's damage
[0:55:05] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:55:07] <+glgzephyr> GET THAT SHIT
[0:55:09] <Phlaminngooo> Purple CAN hurt you
[0:55:09] <+AWanderingKenku> ! CURSED !
[0:55:09] <%holydeviant1> it feels like Kaine is gonna dropkick a monster from offscreen while dropping a f bomb
[0:55:09] <Teras_ode> then their bloodline will not continue
[0:55:11] <Louie_Salmon> The classic curse items
[0:55:12] <+glgzephyr> low probability
[0:55:13] <Slimeking_Mike> Maligmantcy
[0:55:16] <+TheIrritableDespicable> you're probably going to have to take the L on some of these debuffs if you want the good stuff
[0:55:18] <+johnnychopsocky> dice roll item
[0:55:20] <Louie_Salmon> Necessary in all rogue-likes
[0:55:27] <Astrophizz> chaos gate
[0:55:29] <%rottingpastry> well that's a not great one lol
[0:55:29] <%MrBorisMakarov> OH GOD
[0:55:30] <+glgzephyr> oh wow that's a TERRIBLE malfunction
[0:55:35] <%blastyoboots> conditional curse!
[0:55:36] <Louie_Salmon> Damage when picking up items, that's rough
[0:55:38] <BeagleCypher> Oof
[0:55:42] <+Double_Tap_That> Chaos boons
[0:55:44] <user_naim> Like that gross, rusted storage key we all have
[0:55:44] <%Arancet> those barred doors have an unlock spot to shoot nearby, it emits a beep and flash while aiming
[0:55:45] <AoiRob> challenge room got it
[0:55:48] <+glgzephyr> that's legitimately the worst malfunction I've seen yet
[0:55:50] <+johnnychopsocky> oooooof, that's a bad dice roll
[0:55:51] <%Dakuu75> I love Pat's paraphrasing because it's exactly how I talk
[0:55:54] <yourliteraldog> These enemies   look fimilar but unique it's weird. Spaghetti Dogs are unsettling
[0:56:02] <%MrBorisMakarov> look for button to shoot
[0:56:06] <%MrBorisMakarov> yeye
[0:56:06] <puse9> shoot a yellow button near the door area
[0:56:07] <Louie_Salmon> Every new system seems super cool
[0:56:10] <%jorniev> this FEEELS so much like a metroid
[0:56:17] <%rottingpastry> some juicy health

[1:02:56] <+BusterRepukken> @venomryu Ok?
[1:02:58] <TopTierHarley> let older woman exist in games
[1:03:00] <+glgzephyr> @hax_metatron I've "beaten" it once. It is quite good and promises to get better
[1:03:10] <%illusiveSaint> this is a very familiar concept of deja vu
[1:03:13] <+senfood> Selene is a handsome woman.
[1:03:16] <yourliteraldog> Thats quite ethical
[1:03:18] <%YakumoYomi> Objective: Survive
[1:03:25] <%blastyoboots> TRAUMA-induced heterochromia?!?
[1:03:26] <Djinnazz> wow
[1:03:27] <Dunmarkh> how?
[1:03:27] <+glgzephyr> LUL
[1:03:28] <%MrBorisMakarov> what
[1:03:28] <%BoxNavy> monkaS ?
[1:03:29] <%octavian_wolf> ooooo
[1:03:29] <+BusterRepukken> she got David Bowie'd
[1:03:29] <%W1nterTitan> Smack to the head
[1:03:31] <%luftraumm1> like bowie
[1:03:32] <+Shonen_hero> trauma induced heterochromia?
[1:03:32] <+spinalwizard> Flash burn?
[1:03:32] <SaltyAzteca> Dayum
[1:03:33] <$Ziegsy> oh so she was in prey
[1:03:34] <ivanmistwalker> ???
[1:03:35] <%octavian_wolf> how does that happen?
[1:03:36] <+StatesmanPrimal> hwat, trauma induced heterochromia
[1:03:36] <%YakumoYomi> ...how?
[1:03:38] <+glgzephyr> I WONDER WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED
[1:03:39] <Dunmarkh> that's really anime
[1:03:40] <+Shonen_hero> is that real?
[1:03:40] <yourliteraldog> Her eye got smacked
[1:03:41] <+Toblo1> Trauma-induced?
[1:03:42] <+Shonen_hero> Can that happen?
[1:03:45] <Deceptimus> That's not how genetics work...
[1:03:46] <%blastyoboots> "Injury. In some cases, an injury to the eye may cause one of the eyes to change color. This is also possible with the trauma that can occur when someone has certain types of eye surgeries. Bleeding in the eye, due to a condition or an injury, may also influence a change in the color of the iris."

[1:03:51] <yourliteraldog> Stem Cells
[1:03:52] <%goose_attack_almanac> SPACE
[1:03:53] <Teras_ode> blood caused the other eye to turn brown
[1:03:53] <%s1rcuit> @TopTierHarley I'd rather have an older, smarter woman than some 20 something bimbo going "WhAt Is GoInG oN?????????"
[1:03:54] <Kanrir_> bowie had the same thing
[1:03:55] <+BusterRepukken> it happened to david bowie
[1:03:56] <Louie_Salmon> But physical trauma or emotional trauma?
[1:03:56] <+xendless_xurbia> David Bowie had that
[1:03:57] <SaltyAzteca> Physical stress, maybe its red?
[1:03:57] <hot4dukat> Bowie was not heterochromatic
[1:03:58] <%luftraumm1> Bowie got his eye blown
[1:03:59] <venomryu> @TopTierHarley that fine i just dont like it just an opinion
[1:04:00] <%patriotrenegade> Heterochromia doesn’t work like that
[1:04:00] <deviljhojho_> SPACE
[1:04:02] <+CookieCutter007> she turned anime
[1:04:05] <%Blackleafx> bowie
[1:04:09] <HeroToxiko> Thats what happened to david bowie
[1:04:09] <+allups> i wanna play this game so badly. hopefully, it still sells only being on PS5 though
[1:04:09] <+StatesmanPrimal> hm, i didn't know that, interesting

[1:04:14] <%acridpaladin> get wiki'd chat
[1:04:15] <%Dakuu75> interesting
[1:04:17] <+senfood> David Bowie did not have heterochromea
[1:04:18] <$Ziegsy> If you let babies stare at the sun their eyes go weird
[1:04:18] <+Toblo1> Oh jeezus
[1:04:19] <thelonechris> Fucking biology
[1:04:20] <%s1rcuit> @blastyoboots thanks for that packet of information

[1:04:27] <%king_wragles> What did Pat make a lucky guess at? I was making a drink?
[1:04:29] <%illusiveSaint> sound a little too anime
[1:04:30] <%jorniev> david bowie
[1:04:32] <+glgzephyr> @Dakuu75 At last we know the truth
[1:04:33] <%octavian_wolf> thank you, WikiPerson
[1:04:33] <%YakumoYomi> @blastyoboots Thanks. I learned something new.
[1:04:34] <DianaTheAscian> EYE FACTS
[1:04:36] <%jorniev> DAVID BOWIE
[1:04:36] <+johnnychopsocky> the baby.  the baby.  the baby.
[1:04:36] <%patriotrenegade> But not MENTAL trauma, right
[1:04:39] <RadShiro> but how can baby cry upstairs if hes playing the game?
[1:04:39] <+GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> David Bowie got hurt and had one pupil permanently dilated because of it
[1:04:44] <+BusterRepukken> david bowie got punched so hard, his eye changed., sounds like trauma induced to me
[1:04:45] <yourliteraldog> That or they grew her a new eye from a compatible donner
[1:04:46] <+StatesmanPrimal> Crazy Talk PogChamp
[1:04:51] <marvel877> Bowie didnt have heterochromia, one of his eyes was permanently always dilated
[1:04:52] <+glgzephyr> @illusiveSaint Anime is based off of real life LUL
[1:04:58] <%blastyoboots> @YakumoYomi you're welcome, just the fastest to google it is all
[1:04:58] <DianaTheAscian> is that why David Bowie had it?
[1:04:59] <rReizs> physical trauma right, eye injury
[1:05:06] <Teras_ode> yeah is blood gets inside the eye or something it can paint it brown when it starts to dry or something
[1:05:07] <TopTierHarley> yup
[1:05:07] <%jorniev> ITS A DAVID BOWIE REFERENCE?
[1:05:22] <%blastyoboots> "People who weren't born with heterochromia might still develop it, as it can also be caused by trauma (due to injury or surgery) or disease (such as diabetes, eye tumors, or glaucoma). Acquired heterochromia might look as interesting as congenital heterochromia, but it often indicates the eye is damaged or unhealthy."

[1:16:08] <yourliteraldog> I sense not only a double jump but a jet pack
[1:16:11] <%rottingpastry> it a half life
[1:16:13] <%RoboticAnimeDude> i played about 6 hours of this. its fucking incredible
[1:16:14] <boardscanada> why don't you give her a rolling ball too and non-procedural level design, then you have Metroid

[1:17:00] <%king_wragles> I would like this aesthetic in an actual shooter-RPG
[1:17:01] <aiutare47> Very Giger
[1:17:03] <deviljhojho_> the orb rumbles with glee
[1:17:06] <%htbearx> this game do be pretty

[1:17:16] <ergulor> Money = Power
[1:17:18] <%s1rcuit> I'd laugh so hard if they made do a morph ball-esqe transformation, but it's something super impractical like a cube
[1:17:19] <%BoxNavy> money=power
[1:17:19] <%0dokuro> Its what drew me in so much. Came for the aesthetic, stayed for the addicting gun play.
[1:17:26] <%rottingpastry> I hope it rounds up
[1:17:28] <Louie_Salmon> So these are the "items" of this game
[1:17:31] <%king_wragles> Actually, you know what I want? I want God Fall to not be such cowards, use this aesthetic and be a good game
[1:17:31] <%rcand9> cuno is hot shit

[1:18:07] <monkaSol> melting, the floor is water
[1:18:08] <StaceMcGate> We must kill the water
[1:18:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> God Fall was never going to be a good game.
[1:18:10] <%Mendin> I was thinking Money==Power from Isaac but yes
[1:18:12] <ThDark> Water is the true ancient evil
[1:18:15] <deviljhojho_> imagine knowing how to swim
[1:18:16] <Vallhaine> i can't believe you've done this
[1:18:17] <+allups> At least its forgiving when it comes to that
[1:18:18] <%rcand9> assassins creed water
[1:18:19] <yourliteraldog> Maybe it not water
[1:18:20] <%dekkitout> Water, the trickiest, sexiest molecule
[1:18:22] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Why would liquids conspire against man like this?
[1:18:26] <%Monkeyweed21> its hard to swim with baby legs
[1:18:27] <StaceMcGate> Is Godfall even still supported?
[1:18:27] <%Arancet> aint seen nothing yet
[1:18:28] <+johnnychopsocky> glub glub got got again
[1:18:29] <Devbob98> Not being able to see pat’s health puts me on edge
[1:18:29] <+abrupt_abe> The particle effects get truly nuts in big fights
[1:18:34] <+StatesmanPrimal> the universal solvent, it shall dissolve your SOUL
[1:18:37] <jbrachob> because SPOILERS...you are ACTUALLY  a rat
[1:18:38] <deviljhojho_> so PS5 has spiderman, demon souls and maybe this as its line up so far?
[1:18:40] <+johnnychopsocky> The water got me too
[1:18:43] <%0dokuro> Wait till your screen is filled with them from monsters, fucking kra.
[1:18:43] <%s1rcuit> add water to the list, right under gravity, heights exceeding three feet, and non-right angles
[1:18:46] <deviljhojho_> Seems enticing but nothing to waste 500 bucks over
[1:18:55] <%rottingpastry> ?
[1:19:01] <deviljhojho_> looks like a loot crate
[1:19:04] <+allups> new gun

[1:20:39] <ThDark> Humans have statues like that
[1:20:39] <Hydrapissed> we do
[1:20:39] <theshillman> it's symbolic
[1:20:41] <+UnabashedGarbage> Maybe they're just a really big fan of the arts Pat
[1:20:42] <%blastyoboots> What if that expression means "I have an erection" in alien-ish?
[1:20:42] <+StatesmanPrimal> hey man, caliban is a fine planet

[1:20:51] <%cache_22> Humans, what a bunch of bastards.
[1:20:51] <thelonechris> It's why aliens aren't talking to us
[1:20:51] <GigaSeifer> yeah, why do you think no one wants to contact us?
[1:20:52] <laguerrilha> The gun altar is worrisome
[1:20:52] <%Monkeyweed21> @Hydrapissed imagine being an alien and getting attacked by a hippo
[1:20:52] <ergulor> and we are trouble

[1:21:12] <StaceMcGate> Moon's broken
[1:21:12] <%0dokuro> We were the xenotype the entire time.
[1:21:14] <%rottingpastry> shattered moon?
[1:21:17] <%s1rcuit> looks like the sky is broken
[1:21:17] <%blastyoboots> remember the pieces in orbit?
[1:21:17] <%rottingpastry> wow rude
[1:21:18] <jbrachob> broken space time_
[1:21:18] <%rcand9> awwwww
[1:21:19] <captainnathaniel> moon?
[1:21:19] <%valriot> Its there to protect the aliens from Levi
[1:21:20] <zugzwane> its a shattered moon
[1:21:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's some shit ya know
[1:21:21] <%dekkitout> I'm tired of walls tajWHY
[1:21:22] <radioamnesiac> him sploded
[1:21:22] <+johnnychopsocky> Our statues are warnings for aliens
[1:21:22] <ThDark> Aliens looked at earth, and saw that statue of the guy throwing a bunch of babies and said "nope"
[1:21:22] <%Pappajimbo> 'umies piss off
[1:21:22] <%Mendin> Crack the Sky
[1:21:27] <DianaTheAscian> some rad shit thats what

[1:21:39] <%Hiro01231> yes
[1:21:42] <Devbob98> What a loser, died on floor 1
[1:21:51] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt shattered moon?
[1:21:51] <StaceMcGate> dun dun duuuuun
[1:21:53] <nomolomo> hey gang! hows the game so far?
[1:21:57] <+abrupt_abe> This game is deeply unnerving
[1:21:57] <%Mendin> The Sentients?
[1:21:58] <+glgzephyr> that looks like some kind of *moon*
[1:22:00] <%Mendin> Oh no
[1:22:04] <+michingmallecho> Sentients?
[1:22:05] <%rcand9> thats no moon
[1:22:06] <%s1rcuit> it looks like broken glass
[1:22:06] <%blastyoboots> THE SENTIENTS is not a warframe reference.  also Pat you saw that in the intro cutscene going down into the planet
[1:22:06] <ergulor> looks pretty good
[1:22:06] <deviljhojho_> this aint hawaii
[1:22:07] <%Mendin> LUA?!?
[1:22:07] <%hamborgini> is the twist going to be that -she- sent the signal? I hope not.
[1:22:09] <Louie_Salmon> So a code that only means something to you broadcasts from some random planet, that is some shit
[1:22:11] <+chickenmcmuffet> GUNS
[1:22:11] <ScreamLord> You mean a Moon?
[1:22:15] <+allups> one voice actor. thats pretty big brain housemarque
[1:22:15] <%0dokuro> Giger left his call card here.
[1:22:19] <rReizs> pat seal of approval so far
[1:22:20] <+johnnychopsocky> game is great.  Runs are loooong
[1:22:20] <$Ziegsy> Hey its giger works! Time to spot the penis
[1:22:20] <emmmdeekay> The moon is fucked up? Is this secretly RWBY?
[1:22:22] <%jorniev> spsguetification?
[1:22:24] <StaceMcGate> this is clearly the origin story for 13 Sentinels
[1:22:31] <%Monkeyweed21> alien rebar
[1:22:33] <aiutare47> GIGER
[1:22:34] <+glgzephyr> she's just calling the aliens Sentients because they were sentient LUL
[1:22:37] <%linSP> googer
[1:22:41] <radioamnesiac> a mean tree
[1:22:41] <%rottingpastry> these aliens do not look enough like penises
[1:22:45] <TopTierHarley> Use tree to go up then dash out
[1:22:47] <theshillman> @Ziegsy the penis was inside you all along
[1:22:47] <%luftraumm1> it's more giger than most alien stuff
[1:22:49] <%valriot> Its very Eldritch
[1:22:49] <Skeledan> hieronymous bosch?
[1:22:50] <MAX116030> It sure has a little of giger
[1:22:52] <+Double_Tap_That> Not enough sexual imagery for the G-man.
[1:22:58] <+StatesmanPrimal> I agree, they need to be more phallic
[1:23:01] <+ZweihanderSteve> feels more like riey scott than Giger
[1:23:03] <+senfood> It reminds me of whoever draw the classic Dune novel covers.
[1:23:05] <StaceMcGate> not phallic enough for Gieger
[1:23:09] <+allups> they should make a game like this but for ruiner
[1:23:10] <SaltyAzteca> I AM THE SENATE
[1:23:15] <+michingmallecho> There needs to be more vaginas
[1:23:16] <%0dokuro> Remember everyone, these arent eldritch beings, just fungus.
[1:23:16] <$Ziegsy> @theshillman No wonder I was sitting funny
[1:23:19] <DickieWoodsmall_279> it's Ilos from ME1
[1:23:27] <+allups> big aoe
[1:23:29] <radioamnesiac> not enough lady bots looking sad
[1:23:37] <%luftraumm1> get some beksinski in your giger
[1:23:38] <%maenos2> fungus are eldritch beings though
[1:23:39] <yourliteraldog> Shoot the barncle
[1:23:46] <+StatesmanPrimal> these aliens have a very, something, about their design I can't really place, kinda like avatar
[1:23:49] <sirtommygunn> kill first loot later
[1:23:50] <+michingmallecho> The music sounds pretty cool
[1:23:51] <+abrupt_abe> Rad
[1:23:51] <rReizs> oh hey those tentacles can bring you higher for exploration
[1:23:52] <hot4dukat> Reminds me of Crysis
[1:23:58] <StaceMcGate> if first boss is a spiky vagina then maaaybe its Gieger
[1:23:59] <%Mendin> Is that red vine hurting you, or just lifting you up? Cause it looked like a platform above there
[1:23:59] <+Double_Tap_That> @0dokuro Are you suggesting fungus *isn't* eldritch in nature?
[1:24:01] <+johnnychopsocky> Can't be Ridley Scott.  Not enough FANS AND STEAM
[1:24:03] <+abrupt_abe> Ride the barnacle
[1:24:04] <%rcand9> yeah i think i might buy this game
[1:24:04] <yourliteraldog> I see
[1:24:08] <TopTierHarley> you can ride the barnacle, just do let it eat you @PatStaresAt
[1:24:09] <+Dova573> The tentacles remind me of the aliens from Edge from tomorrow
[1:24:11] <%luftraumm1> ugh barnacles are the worst
[1:24:12] <Dunmarkh> that looks very invincible
[1:24:12] <%Broand> Can you ride the barnacle to reach higher places?
[1:24:12] <emmmdeekay> The barnacles are stairs
[1:24:13] <thelonechris> EMP
[1:24:15] <%rcand9> if i can ever get a ps5
[1:24:15] <%cache_22> Can you use the barnacle to go to a higher platform?
[1:24:17] <nomolomo> barnicle op
[1:24:19] <emmmdeekay> use them to reach a higher ground
[1:24:19] <%MrBorisMakarov> some places you can use those to ride up to higher places @patstaresat
[1:24:20] <zugzwane> @PatStaresAt maybe you can ride the barnacle up to a higher platform
[1:24:20] <+TheIrritableDespicable> you can use the tentacle to get to higher places. just don't pull an Icarus
[1:24:21] <%Arancet> @PatStaresAt you can often use the barnacle to reach higher areas
[1:24:22] <$Ziegsy> CHAFF GRENADE
[1:24:26] <Reanimator83> The design reminds me more of Zdzislaw Beksinski art
[1:24:27] <+glgzephyr> @PatStaresAt you can use the invincible tentacles as an elevator
[1:24:28] <theshillman> ride the tentacles pat
[1:24:31] <+allups> it is pretty grey i wish there was a bit more color. maybe in another tileset
[1:24:37] <yourliteraldog> Barnacle ride
[1:24:38] <DianaTheAscian> xeno?
[1:24:45] <Louie_Salmon> Got it, save them forever
[1:24:47] <+StatesmanPrimal> fungal-animal alien life is super fascinating, if I could be a xenobiologist I would
[1:24:50] <TopTierHarley> L1
[1:24:53] <BlueBiscuitGT> Oh no I'll never use them
[1:24:57] <zashzila> 1.2k pog.
[1:24:58] <rReizs> still an enemy here
[1:24:59] <Louie_Salmon> Never use it, understood
[1:25:04] <$ThiccZilla> does that camera on her neck make it so she can see her self in 3rd person?
[1:25:14] <%Arancet> @PatStaresAt you can often use the barnacle to reach higher areas
[1:25:14] <%0dokuro> You'll use it at some points
[1:25:23] <%rottingpastry> zip zap
[1:25:29] <+allups> nice
[1:25:31] <theshillman> pat rides the tentacle challenge 2021
[1:25:33] <zashzila> This games's map is clean af.
[1:25:37] <laguerrilha> Thats a load of barnacles
[1:25:39] <%rottingpastry> ride the barnacle carousel
[1:25:40] <%jorniev> gross
[1:25:43] <$Afterman_> its like traveling through the blood elevator in DMC5
[1:25:43] <+abrupt_abe> Headphones work great with this game
[1:25:43] <+johnnychopsocky> Use them.  You lose them on death.
[1:25:44] <%Mendin> GORB
[1:25:45] <%linSP> get suck and ascend
[1:25:47] <yourliteraldog> Fucking cool
[1:25:49] <+StatesmanPrimal> LUL
[1:25:55] <%greasypete00> so is the lore kinda like metroid stuff with the xeno-species
[1:26:00] <+Double_Tap_That> Cave Story triangle
[1:26:02] <%luftraumm1> if you want some nightmare fuel go research parasitic barnacles
[1:26:03] <$Ziegsy> NGL the noises of the barnacle are pretty nice
[1:26:04] <yourliteraldog> Sounds super dangerous smoke that space
[1:26:08] <%greasypete00> metroid prime specifically
[1:26:08] <+senfood> I can see the rule 34 being made as we speak.
[1:26:08] <rReizs> its like the matrix and martial arts
[1:26:15] <aiutare47> Why do they instantly need to train lots of soldiers?
[1:26:16] <Louie_Salmon> Upcoming? So the pool of weapons is upgraded?
[1:26:23] <zashzila> This game's ambience is also really stellar.
[1:26:23] <StaceMcGate> unfortunately Selene is not a 7 foot tall amazon bounty hunter
[1:26:30] <Calek> @Louie_Salmon all future weapons are slightly better
[1:26:37] <%rottingpastry> small syphilis
[1:26:38] <Jaller101514> Just got here from work. Is Pat liking the game so far?
[1:26:43] <alwayspronking> Clap
[1:26:44] <trianglehat> foam brick wall
[1:26:46] <thelonechris> This game makes me wish I could acquire a PS5
[1:26:50] <+johnnychopsocky> NICE
[1:26:52] <$ThiccZilla> @zashzila inter-stella?
[1:26:53] <%AzureGale> @Jaller101514 Quite so
[1:26:56] <DickieWoodsmall_279> if returnal is a girl why isn't she thicc? this is video games after all
[1:26:57] <%Arancet> @Jaller101514 big enjoy
[1:27:00] <%sleeplessmetro> that was satisfying
[1:27:08] <%rottingpastry> orb cube
[1:27:08] <%0dokuro> Some animations are really weird for her, mostly action ones, but the movement of a lot of the enemies is really good when I played.
[1:27:09] <+Weeewer> Yo this game fucking slaps
[1:27:10] <%radda343> roguemetroidvanialike shooter
[1:27:11] <+Weeewer> Big budget
[1:27:13] <+johnnychopsocky> Worried he'd miss that.  I almost did.
[1:27:14] <%MrBorisMakarov> C U B E
[1:27:16] <Jaller101514> nice!
[1:27:18] <theshillman> THE CUBE
[1:27:20] <aiutare47> @dickiewoodsmall_279 She has a bit of one
[1:27:20] <rReizs> CUBE SPHERE
[1:27:21] <%coward_man> so like, does this game have a story? or is it just roguelite all the time?
[1:27:23] <%The_Gaming_Karp> I have returned - any deaths since the first one?
[1:27:26] <zashzila> @ThiccZilla Lmao its really good.
[1:27:31] <%The_Gaming_Karp> The Dreaded Cube!
[1:27:31] <StaceMcGate> locked chest?
[1:27:32] <+Dova573> Man if I have not adulted recently a put a downpayment on a car, I would get this game now
[1:27:33] <laguerrilha> the CUBE
[1:27:39] <+Weeewer> This definitely has a story
[1:27:44] <%dekkitout> That is an affront to geometric god
[1:27:58] <+Dova573> Damn you adult responsibilities
[1:27:58] <$ThiccZilla> @coward_man its got a decent story but more gameplay roguelike focused
[1:27:59] <%The_Gaming_Karp> the cubes serve their conical overlords
[1:28:00] <%0dokuro> I hope it does
[1:28:04] <%Arancet> havent seen the depositer yet
[1:28:12] <%shootbang_exe> god please
[1:28:12] <StaceMcGate> who made this?
[1:28:13] <thelonechris> Returnal: Repentance
[1:28:17] <%shootbang_exe> that would be fantastic
[1:28:19] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah Rogue-likes are perfect for just adding stuff
[1:28:20] <%cache_22> I hope it gets a straight-up Alien crossover.
[1:28:21] <%0dokuro> So far it seems really good, but I only got to the third area.
[1:28:22] <+johnnychopsocky> hate barnacles.  In every game they show up in
[1:28:23] <DickieWoodsmall_279> Returnal:Afterbirth
[1:28:23] <+allups> hope it does too. is it coming to PC at all?
[1:28:27] <+b_aleph> this is a roguelike??????
[1:28:31] <Devbob98> It has a specific shape to put it on, you’ll know
[1:28:36] <%radda343> hey pat do you have an affiliate link for this
[1:28:37] <%coward_man> okay, might pick it up on sale. money this month is reserved for village
[1:28:39] <yourliteraldog> @aiutare47 I'm gonna say with their level of technology they where probably imperialist so I guess rebellion on fringe world was an actual worry. Since they are all dead it probably conflict that ended them
[1:28:40] <%RoboticAnimeDude> if it doesn't do well i will have lost faith in the gaming community. OH WAIT I already have they suck
[1:28:42] <$Ziegsy> No Spoilers, but does the level design change or we grey-green foresting all day?
[1:28:49] <+allups> very high end rouge like
[1:28:53] <Louie_Salmon> Uh oh
[1:28:55] <dan_g_v> oof
[1:28:56] <+b_aleph> Wow, it got my attention now
[1:28:57] <StaceMcGate> "now neither of us will be virgins"
[1:28:58] <SaltyAzteca> By far the fanciest roguelike
[1:28:59] <AllenDeadman> oh
[1:28:59] <%dalmek> wh
[1:28:59] <Devbob98> @ziegsy Yes
[1:29:00] <+BIumen> monka fuckin ess
[1:29:00] <Louie_Salmon> That is very not good
[1:29:02] <Djinnazz> well that's terrifying
[1:29:02] <+koriar> I probably should have guessed it was a rogue-like... much less interested now
[1:29:03] <+PenmanLupine> this is something Neill Blomkamp would make
[1:29:03] <Calek> @Ziegsy it changes
[1:29:03] <user_naim> If only I could get a PS5, let alone have it drop in price
[1:29:05] <shaddydaddyo> @Ziegsy it changes
[1:29:05] <%bassoontyphoon> Selene Final Boss??
[1:29:06] <%rottingpastry> implications of self murder
[1:29:08] <%za7az> Uh oh
[1:29:09] <+Weeewer> My only negative with this game is that there is no quick save I dont think
[1:29:12] <%linSP> are there any other triple a rougelikes?
[1:29:14] <Qsmash_> I wonder if the PS5's availability will affect this game's success much.
[1:29:15] <deviljhojho_> "im a me" Jane Returnal
[1:29:15] <%radda343> hey pat do you have an affiliate link for this
[1:29:15] <%MrBorisMakarov> don't let it set in
[1:29:15] <%blastyoboots> wow
[1:29:15] <+NohbdyIsCrash> I am actually screaming right now
[1:29:15] <OkamiDude15> @StaceMcGate housemarque
[1:29:16] <+Weeewer> But the gameplay and story have been great so far
[1:29:16] <%shootbang_exe> that's fucking nightmare fuel
[1:29:17] <$Ziegsy> thank you darlins
[1:29:19] <sirtommygunn> I'm excited to get this once I've gone through my backlog of "every good PS4 game"
[1:29:25] <+Double_Tap_That> The existential horror continues
[1:29:28] <%0dokuro> @Ziegsy everytime a run restarts the area changes, later you go into more biomes that are drastically different. Like a sand level.
[1:29:30] <user_naim> okay that’s fucked
[1:29:32] <DickieWoodsmall_279> NieR twist: every enemy is actually you
[1:29:35] <%toastybites> sounds like multiplayer
[1:29:37] <StaceMcGate> that'd be awesome if you had to fight past versions of yourself with the upgrades you had @PatStaresAt
[1:29:37] <jbrachob> future teleporter_
[1:29:38] <%dekkitout> Something something Theseus
[1:29:39] <user_naim> @sirtommygunn true
[1:29:39] <SaltyAzteca> them feet tho
[1:29:40] <aiutare47> @yourliteraldog Yeah I guess it’s kinda a sci-fi trope that fallen race is super empire.
[1:29:43] <jbrachob> ?
[1:29:44] <deviljhojho_> dreading hard or hardly dreading, am i right
[1:29:49] <%kyh9> kyh9 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! This looks decent.  I bitch about Sony being all about that third person action/shooter game.  But I'd be lying if I said they weren't still fun
[1:29:50] <%sleeplessmetro> this kind of horror is so up my alley
[1:29:51] <$Ziegsy> @0dokuro not SAND
[1:29:55] <%MrBorisMakarov> the particle effects in this game are so fucking sick
[1:29:56] <trianglehat> Squid1 Squid2 Squid4
[1:29:59] <+StatesmanPrimal> I need to get through my RPG backlog NotLikeThis
[1:29:59] <%arcielardor> she could kill herself a shit zillion times and make a Mountain into space with her dead clones!!
[1:30:02] <aiutare47> Fast travel maybe?
[1:30:03] <%0dokuro> Sand indeed
[1:30:17] <SaltyAzteca> We got crits
[1:30:22] <StaceMcGate> would you classify this as horror? maybe just psychological or suspenseful?
[1:30:23] <%za7az> @arcielardor SPOILERS Kappa
[1:30:30] <%cache_22> Do you have a melee attack?
[1:30:35] <%0dokuro> This game really requires some good reaction later on.
[1:30:38] <+Weeewer> There is some psychological horror shit in this
[1:30:38] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @kyh9 wow just realized they went full 2000s xbox
[1:30:46] <%The_Gaming_Karp> pat is covering the health bar(s)
[1:30:52] <deviljhojho_> doesnt seem spooky enough to be horror
[1:30:57] <Devbob98> No I frames on scanning
[1:31:06] <rReizs> minimap for enemies
[1:31:09] <yourliteraldog> If your going to be a space explore you should be required to grapple with existentialism before you get sent on a mission. Also  passive Nihilists would have to be screened out
[1:31:10] <+Gespens> Shield
[1:31:11] <+allups> a machine that still works
[1:31:11] <%MrBorisMakarov> wha
[1:31:13] <+ChaosAethr> is this game just edge of tomorrow?
[1:31:14] <ergulor> use the nades
[1:31:15] <$ThiccZilla> use the grenade you picked up
[1:31:15] <Qsmash_> this must be one of those turrets
[1:31:17] <rReizs> kill turret
[1:31:17] <+TheIrritableDespicable> use your turret  consumable
[1:31:19] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> use Item
[1:31:20] <$ThiccZilla> disables turrets
[1:31:20] <%rottingpastry> is it a turret?
[1:31:25] <%The_Gaming_Karp> planet really doesn't like you
[1:31:25] <jbrachob> ...pat
[1:31:25] <+johnnychopsocky> Consume
[1:31:25] <%skizzuto> use that turret thingy
[1:31:26] <%Finalgear14> you can't break the shield till you get a sword
[1:31:28] <+xendless_xurbia> stop backseating chat
[1:31:29] <Jaller101514> Turret bomb!
[1:31:30] <%0dokuro> Dont got what you need yet @PatStaresAt
[1:31:31] <OkamiDude15> @cache_22 you acquire more abilities as you progress. a melee attack being one of them
[1:31:31] <%za7az> @ChaosAethr Pretty much
[1:31:34] <+SeventhVice> @patstaresat the mini map shows hostiles
[1:31:35] <hot4dukat> Turret
[1:31:41] <Louie_Salmon> A switch to shut it off somewhere?
[1:31:42] <hot4dukat> Disable
[1:31:50] <Devbob98> You don’t have weapon to destroy it yet
[1:31:50] <yourliteraldog> Drink the Coolant
[1:31:52] <DickieWoodsmall_279> well now you know forever
[1:31:55] <%linSP> do you think its possible to beat that thing before the title screen?
[1:32:02] <StaceMcGate> if only Pat was on the left side so we could see his health LUL
[1:32:03] <+allups> that mini map is so cluttered i cant see shit on it
[1:32:06] <%Jspeed8th> You can only destroy them with melee
[1:32:10] <yourliteraldog> It bet their antifreeze taste just as good ours
[1:32:11] <%0dokuro> Maybe?
[1:32:18] <%MrBorisMakarov> you'll see soon
[1:32:18] <%Arancet> money does not persist
[1:32:18] <+Gespens> money does NOT persist
[1:32:23] <Calek> jackpot
[1:32:24] <%0dokuro> Careful
[1:32:25] <%blastyoboots> "I don't think I'm gonna live through this run", said in a roguelike
[1:32:26] <%rottingpastry> oh look fun chests
[1:32:28] <+walternatorz> money is used in exchange for goods and services
[1:32:28] <+TheIrritableDespicable> embrace the darkness
[1:32:30] <$ThiccZilla> money doesnt persist
[1:32:34] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @StaceMcGate the fact pat is on screen means we must see his health at all times
[1:32:35] <%thelaxinator> Do we know if this is a rogue-like or a -lite yet?
[1:32:38] <Calek> easy malfunction to fix
[1:32:39] <Louie_Salmon> Wow that's lucky
[1:32:40] <Devbob98> Gambler Pat coming up
[1:32:41] <%Arancet> dont be too afraid of malignancy unless you already have 2 malfunctions
[1:32:42] <%rottingpastry> well, you can fix that one by opening the other two containers, nbd
[1:32:42] <sirtommygunn> How do the controller gimmicks feel with this game?

[1:34:32] <%0dokuro> Each weapon has two variations from what Ive seen so far. @PatStaresAt
[1:34:37] <Calek> you have a 2 star weapon the container had a 1 star weapon
[1:34:40] <aiutare47> Stumbo
[1:34:44] <Louie_Salmon> That's the data tab, equipment is a different tab
[1:34:47] <+senfood> I think this might be a very good game.
[1:34:49] <+Gespens> It's different alt fire effects, but they have different stats. You can check what the alt fire and traits of the gun are in the equipment tab
[1:34:56] <Alfred_Waaghur> Is this a sci-fi rougelike?
[1:35:01] <%rottingpastry> lol
[1:35:09] <%BoxNavy> monkaS

[1:35:14] <%0dokuro> Thats from the malfunction
[1:35:35] <%rottingpastry> it's a aliem
[1:35:35] <Louie_Salmon> Should have dodged to avoid that I guess
[1:35:37] <+BigDumBeak> isn't there a sprint or is that an unlockable?

[1:35:58] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> Chastity belt
[1:35:58] <TopTierHarley> @BigDumBeak there is he just isn't using it
[1:36:01] <Calek> fits like a glove
[1:36:02] <thelonechris> Why do they have devil horns though?
[1:36:02] <%The_Gaming_Karp> what could possibly go wrong
[1:36:02] <LoneFonte> oh sure, just put it in
[1:36:03] <scrumbotime> HOW DOES THAT APPEAR SAFE
[1:36:03] <Astrophizz> what can go wrong
[1:36:04] <%AzureGale> Sure, just stick the weird alien thing on your back
[1:36:04] <yourliteraldog> Fuck pop it on death is meaningless now
[1:36:07] <deviljhojho_> strap it and snap it
[1:36:09] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> That looks WAY too organic
[1:36:11] <phone5> thats fucking stupid
[1:36:13] <aiutare47> Yeah that won’t give you space AIDS
[1:36:18] <%NopeBadguy> i just tuned in, is this a dead space
[1:36:20] <%luftraumm1> what could possibly go wrong
[1:36:21] <hakumaribo> so what is this game, is it a rogue like?
[1:36:21] <LoneFonte> OH NICE
[1:36:25] <ergulor> ah teleport between rooms
[1:36:25] <DaKnightWarrior> WHY lytJEEZ
[1:36:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> sure okay
[1:36:28] <+senfood> It's fast travel.
[1:36:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> No ideea what it even is
[1:36:33] <Dunmarkh> @hakumaribo yes
[1:36:34] <monkaSol> why not put it on your butt while you're at it
[1:36:34] <+RootVeggie> I have a feeling that by the end of this you're gonna start looking like those monsters
[1:36:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> What even is it
[1:36:36] <Devbob98> You can use that teleporter now too
[1:36:37] <DickieWoodsmall_279> yes, trust the alien teleport
[1:36:39] <Louie_Salmon> Sometimes trying to explain something just makes it sounds dumber
[1:36:39] <%Dakuu75> @hakumaribo yep.
[1:36:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> Sure okay
[1:36:46] <yourliteraldog> She has respawns so it gucci if it kills her
[1:36:56] <%0dokuro> Trust the alien backstrap
[1:37:06] <Louie_Salmon> Okay that absolutely atomized her
[1:37:14] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:37:17] <Louie_Salmon> Like that very clearly turned her into bits
[1:37:19] <%rottingpastry> curse it up
[1:37:21] <%0dokuro> Oof
[1:37:25] <+Weeewer> she just died surely
[1:37:33] <+johnnychopsocky> oh no, that sucks
[1:37:37] <%0dokuro> That malfunction isnt great though
[1:37:39] <Devbob98> Pat really going for cursed build
[1:37:42] <%AzureGale> Now keep that adrenaline level
[1:37:45] <%mostbrokenrobo> mostbrokenrobo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Hey Pat, if teleportation was ever invented, would you try it?
[1:37:50] <%blastyoboots> do you know the consumable button?
[1:37:54] <Louie_Salmon> Just gotta get two resins and you're cured
[1:37:59] <+ChaosAethr> Lose money on Damage
[1:38:00] <+allups> i would
[1:38:03] <%rottingpastry> coward
[1:38:04] <+Gespens> Pat saw that one episode of Star Trek
[1:38:05] <%Dakuu75> I would... if other ppl tested it all ready
[1:38:07] <%Arancet> portals yes, teleporters no
[1:38:12] <thelonechris> That's how you become the Fly
[1:38:15] <%dantegus> pat, turn around
[1:38:17] <%dekkitout> Coward. To scared to have to fight a deranged version of yourself?
[1:38:17] <Astrophizz> even in Star Trek they basically acknowledge it's a new person
[1:38:18] <%Mendin> Try to jump the gap behind you?
[1:38:18] <marvel877> Pat would end up inside out after teleporting
[1:38:25] <sirtommygunn> Just fucking walk
[1:38:25] <SaltyAzteca> Let the first batch teleport first
[1:38:25] <+allups> fuck it id fucking test it
[1:38:26] <%linSP> what about zapping in like raiden
[1:38:28] <yourliteraldog> Technically it elimnates the coin toss diliema because one of you dies for sure
[1:38:28] <user_naim> I would, fuck it, send it!
[1:38:30] <DickieWoodsmall_279> can't they just put a copy of me somewhere else without atomizing the original?
[1:38:32] <sirtommygunn> teleportation is for non-living matter
[1:38:34] <+shruke> but if you're already in a weird death loop, what's to lose?
[1:38:34] <+chickenmcmuffet> pat grab the stuff
[1:38:36] <Devbob98> Go to other teleporter I think
[1:38:37] <+chickenmcmuffet> plase
[1:38:40] <+abrupt_abe> Gun and items?
[1:38:43] <+DeaconBluesClues> what about earth bound teleport where you just run really really fast in a direction
[1:38:45] <Jontman42> I'd have some questions about everything first of teleportation was invented
[1:38:49] <+TINGRIN> @marvel877 You mean right side out
[1:38:49] <%0dokuro> He would never try teleportation, he might become smaller.
[1:38:52] <+chickenmcmuffet> oh
[1:38:56] <%jorniev> would you slingshot yourself like with the zero shift?
[1:38:56] <%linSP> okay how about stargates
[1:38:58] <+Weeewer> you can only have one weapon
[1:39:00] <Ragnadan> whats wrong with teleportation?
[1:39:06] <+StatesmanPrimal> I would teleport, I want new atoms
[1:39:06] <+johnnychopsocky> the teleport effect is something freaking else
[1:39:15] <+allups> what if this was a Metroid game
[1:39:15] <+Weeewer> @Ragnadan the fact that it will kill you
[1:39:23] <$Ziegsy> Whats that book where if you die you wake up somewhere else on the planet, so people killed themselves for teleportation?
[1:39:23] <yourliteraldog> Didn't like that one chieff
[1:39:25] <SaltyAzteca> That ambush
[1:39:33] <+Houser3978> not even just kill, rip you apart on the most atomic level
[1:39:34] <ullyzeez> get high pat
[1:39:35] <jbrachob> that shit that makes you burn slow?
[1:39:41] <Devbob98> Jesus, I need to know pat’s health
[1:39:41] <%0dokuro> You already noticed this, but the effects in this game look amazing.
[1:39:45] <+shruke> shruke subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[1:39:46] <%Mendin> interacts with -timelines-?!?
[1:39:47] <+DeaconBluesClues> @statesmanprimal what of doctors determined teleporting was just great for reducing free radical, like super good for your skin or something
[1:39:53] <SPidERMan8576> Patrick is cool
[1:39:57] <triggersqueeze1985> Crack kills

[1:40:16] <+StatesmanPrimal> that would be pretty pog @deaconbluesclues
[1:40:19] <%0dokuro> Ether is probably the most important resource you can have @PatStaresAt
[1:40:21] <+DeaconBluesClues> like what if the teleport def kills you but also makes you hot as fuck if you do it all the tine6
[1:40:24] <%king_wragles> You mean armor?
[1:40:28] <+allups> o so its not armor
[1:40:30] <yourliteraldog> That sounds like health
[1:40:31] <%bmoral64> you get health when you get health?
[1:40:33] <+Panic_at_the_Discord> if you get health when you're not at full health you get health PogChamp

[1:49:45] <%rottingpastry> if he finds some resin, but that is a random
[1:49:45] <%0dokuro> its probably about 1/3 of his health currently
[1:49:46] <+necrocannibal2> yeah, there are so many roguelikes that I would like if they weren't roguelikes lol

[1:52:20] <puse9> wow that sucked
[1:52:22] <%luftraumm1> this has a lot of money
[1:52:23] <$Afterman_> you should
[1:52:23] <+FoolsArcade> Yeah Max said the same thing
[1:52:24] <%GarbageNirvana> There does seem to be a flavor of Metroid here for sure
[1:52:24] <%0dokuro> I agree
[1:52:24] <%Arancet> you mean prime?
[1:52:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> nothing bad will happen
[1:52:29] <+StatesmanPrimal> oh yeah this is metroid fusion
[1:52:29] <OkamiDude15> a bit
[1:52:31] <%maenos2> you haven't played it?!
[1:52:34] <%BoxNavy> fusion is cool
[1:52:34] <aiutare47> This lady does not seem to like following health and safety protocols
[1:52:35] <TriadOrion> It's more like Metroid Prime, but Fusion a bit
[1:52:37] <puse9> I did and it kinda is LUL
[1:52:37] <sirtommygunn> dont like upgrades that only have a chance of working
[1:52:37] <+allups> i said the same thing too
[1:52:37] <%rottingpastry> no adam
[1:52:41] <+gruff_gridof> doodBigBrain
[1:52:43] <+StatesmanPrimal> sorry prime, I'm dumb
[1:52:43] <%bevyrage> fusion + prime
[1:52:43] <ergulor> dunno it feel more like prime 2 or 3
[1:52:45] <Louie_Salmon> I assume he means Prime?
[1:52:45] <%mostbrokenrobo> getting fusion and prime 2 vibes
[1:52:46] <%0dokuro> Ya, but you have THE CUBE
[1:52:47] <+necrocannibal2> Max is also balding, to be fair
[1:52:48] <dukenux> i dunno if this game can get as dumb as Prometheus
[1:52:48] <%rottingpastry> more hair anyway
[1:52:49] <+G_Thunders> Metroid Other M for sure
[1:52:51] <ThDark> Red one
[1:52:53] <%LailahQueenx> LUL
[1:52:55] <%Raikouija> I mean fusion did have parasites LUL
[1:52:57] <theshillman> OSHA would Have Words with this lady
[1:53:00] <worldbrand> i dont quite see it beyond the surface tbh
[1:53:00] <dukenux> atleast she didnt take iff her helmet
[1:53:03] <DianaTheAscian> Is this just rouge like metroid?
[1:53:03] <+Houser3978> this is like what we though spirit within was ACTUALLY gunna be like
[1:53:03] <+glgzephyr> what about Fusion that Prime doesn't have?
[1:53:05] <+StatesmanPrimal> the concept is like other m and fusion storywise
[1:53:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> oh yes
[1:53:10] <TopTierHarley> that was a better gun
[1:53:10] <%GarbageNirvana> Displacer beasts?
[1:53:14] <jin_kazamaru> Metroid Fusion meets Mass effect Andromeda as a roguelite
[1:53:18] <Devbob98> 3!!!
[1:53:19] <Chatterbox1991> Having better hair is a low bar to pass in your case :)
[1:53:21] <+MK_Ineptitude> what's the consensus on this game any good?
[1:53:28] <rasamune> So much spaghetti getting spilled everywhere
[1:53:28] <%Mendin> Turns out a shotgun and a grenade to the head does Big Easy Quick Stagger Yeah
[1:53:32] <+StatesmanPrimal> oh geez they kind of are displacer beasts
[1:53:35] <supergoblinpunch> l
[1:53:40] <yourliteraldog> Looks pretty sick tbh

[1:54:08] <%0dokuro> Run secured
[1:54:08] <dukenux> this whole game vibe feels like someone took Xen from HL and made a whole game out of it

[1:54:15] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> ok, so part 9 is the last part so far, right?

Hey Pat, i read some time back that there were a couple of Super Best Friends Brawl episodes where you won, but they were scrapped for technical issues. Do you remember what games those were?

[1:54:56] <Calek> found a mini boss in one of these, then my run ended
[1:54:57] <+TheIrritableDespicable> sadly those rooms can only be activated once
[1:54:59] <jin_kazamaru> This makes me hate the PS5 bullcrap even more
[1:55:00] <puse9> it's a 1 time shop
[1:55:01] <+Mcmoblin> House marquee. Resogun
[1:55:05] <+allups> id grab this if i could get a goddamn PS%

[1:55:36] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Use Grande Alt on that wall
[1:55:37] <iosephe> Carbon
[1:55:41] <@commanderclaw> Both work, but apparently gun nuts get picky
[1:55:41] <%Broand> so that gun has a different alt fire than your other carbine?
[1:55:42] <Louie_Salmon> What the hell are you people talking about
[1:55:43] <Deceptimus> Kar-Beam
[1:55:43] <%rottingpastry> the character pronounces it that way

[1:58:01] <+Veraverse> LUL
[1:58:01] <marvel877> CRAZY TALK ACTIVATE
[1:58:05] <+GenesisKnight> we're shocked too
[1:58:06] <%Arancet> the game doesnt want you to die very fast usually
[1:58:06] <user_naim> Like a toilet condom machine
[1:58:07] <%rDAKODAc> What do you think of the game so far?
[1:58:07] <+necrocannibal2> you were almost a clip
[1:58:13] <%0dokuro> Not much hope for the boss though.
[1:58:15] <DianaTheAscian> are runs usually this long?
[1:58:17] <%Agami23> this is giving me some "chozo decided to bathe shit in phazon" vibes
[1:58:19] <dukenux> STD = Space Traveling Disease
[1:58:22] <Reanimator83> Just you wait LUL
[1:58:25] <TopTierHarley> Yup
[1:58:25] <Dunmarkh> time to die
[1:58:29] <+Mcmoblin> I'm 7 runs in and haven't fought boss 1 doodOuch
[1:58:30] <%Arancet> L3 to run
[1:58:31] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> The kind that suck
[1:58:31] <%rottingpastry> a friend orb
[1:58:33] <+Veraverse> What the hell is this
[1:58:35] <TopTierHarley> @PatStaresAt click in stick to run
[1:58:36] <laguerrilha> generator types suck
[1:58:37] <+glgzephyr> time to kill the archvile
[1:58:39] <+TheIrritableDespicable> you can also sprint like hell
[1:58:41] <%linSP> brain of mensis?
[1:58:41] <yourliteraldog> Buffer
[1:58:50] <thelonechris> That thing blew up good
[1:58:54] <+Veraverse> Press run to run
[1:58:54] <dukenux> wtf is a Necrom tech doing here
[1:58:55] <Calek> wonder if you can out DPS those statues in the future
[1:59:07] <%0dokuro> I've died about 4 times and I'm at the third biome, but honestly I'm use to games like this at this point.
[1:59:10] <+Mcmoblin> The creatures in this game look AWESOME
[1:59:11] <Phlaminngooo> they're super weak and often just in the middle of the room so you can kill it the moment you walk in, tho
[1:59:24] <+upandadam> big laser
[1:59:25] <+Veraverse> OOF
[1:59:28] <sirtommygunn> They're really showing off what the new tech can do with the way the enemies crumble or explode
[1:59:30] <%rottingpastry> chargin his laser
[1:59:40] <Djinnazz> @PatStaresAt R3 when you get the chance
[1:59:40] <+glgzephyr> YESSSS
[1:59:42] <+Veraverse> F
[1:59:48] <yourliteraldog> eyy respawn
[1:59:48] <marvel877> Finally
[1:59:49] <+GenesisKnight> Nani
[1:59:49] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Haven't died.
[1:59:50] <%bevyrage> ooooh the charge timer on the flying enemy is shown as a ring that gets smaller until it touches the lazer
[1:59:52] <theshillman> F
[1:59:53] <Qsmash_> crazy talk did indeed activate
[1:59:53] <%greasypete00> thats a doom enemy
[1:59:53] <%rottingpastry> I LIVE...AGAIN
[1:59:54] <ergulor> SAVED!
[1:59:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> ded
[1:59:56] <LordOfThePoultry> huh?
[1:59:58] <%luftraumm1> wait what?
[2:00:00] <Calek> how many times? just the one?
[2:00:00] <%W1nterTitan> SUPER WORTH
[2:00:01] <%Mendin> Looks like that big boi really wants to be headshot to stun it
[2:00:01] <SilverFaustX> u can only use that 1 time
[2:00:04] <puse9> 1 time use
[2:00:06] <SomeAsianDood> 1 time
[2:00:09] <thelonechris> Shouldn't you just be a giant leg?
[2:00:09] <+glgzephyr> he bought a respawn point
[2:00:09] <%0dokuro> Only one time
[2:00:09] <+allups> @SaltkeyAndAckfish its would be fine if they explained that. it makes sense for a xenomorph to be naked
[2:00:11] <%s1rcuit> I just got back, wtf is this DOOM ETERNAL shit!
[2:00:12] <TopTierHarley> @PatStaresAt you can also change the run to be toggled at all times
[2:00:12] <SilverFaustX> not worth so earlie on
[2:00:16] <%shootbang_exe> OH NO
[2:00:17] <+NohbdyIsCrash> The inner horrors continue to scream.
[2:00:20] <+glgzephyr> AS IT SHOULD BE
[2:00:24] <%luftraumm1> guppy's collar shit?
[2:00:24] <SilverFaustX> yes it was
[2:00:25] <%Agami23> ok im glad im not the only one who thought so
[2:00:27] <%rottingpastry> become as goo
[2:00:27] <%Mendin> Oh that teleportation effect was awful
[2:00:27] <%shootbang_exe> that looks like total disassembly no thanks
[2:00:27] <%valriot> Like Bioshock, but good and inside a good game
[2:00:28] <%dekkitout> Be real, you liked it
[2:00:28] <%IDTheftVictim> Ok this aesthetic is sick
[2:00:29] <SelfAwareCanOpener> That’s not ominous
[2:00:34] <%sporeian94> That's a 100% a "kill you and clones you" telkeport
[2:00:38] <aiutare47> I wonder if one these devs got sick of the lack of Metroid and just decided to make their own.
[2:00:39] <%0dokuro> You get things later on to give you more "staying power" if you catch my drift.
[2:00:39] <@commanderclaw> This hell tech makes me want to return to monke
[2:00:39] <+SoySocks> man if only Metroid Prime doors opened that fast
[2:00:41] <+allups> but not the predator @SaltkeyAndAckfish
[2:00:42] <Dunmarkh> that teleport definitely kills and reconstructs a new you
[2:00:45] <%bevyrage> no there's a malignant cluster down there too
[2:00:45] <puse9> it separated your cells WutFace
[2:00:45] <%shadowace2400> !uptime
[2:00:46] <@Moobot> @shadowace2400 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 1m.
[2:00:51] <SilverFaustX> always
[2:00:51] <+glgzephyr> boy that sure is nice
[2:01:02] <+Veraverse> What's even a "you" at this point
[2:01:03] <%0dokuro> Yup
[2:01:05] <+senfood> Heh. Toggle.
[2:01:11] <+Mcmoblin> speed boost
[2:01:13] <+StatesmanPrimal> I mean if it scans in your brain after cloning you I consider that me
[2:01:14] <%shootbang_exe> man she can motor
[2:01:20] <sirtommygunn> i dont know why sprint as a toggle is never the default
[2:01:25] <+GenesisKnight> yay for save points
[2:01:38] <rReizs> looks like the mons have a stun meter
[2:01:38] <+glgzephyr> @PatStaresAt Normal rooms stay, but if you die at a boss, it heals
[2:01:38] <+Mcmoblin> she takes off
[2:01:43] <+necrocannibal2> ok, if enemies stay dead, then I'm interested. even if it call itself a roguelike.
[2:01:48] <thelonechris> The sprint looks kinda weird, like she's moving faster than her feet are hitting the ground
[2:01:50] <+necrocannibal2> calls*
[2:01:56] <%rottingpastry> ether, just like I use with my wife
[2:01:56] <+Veraverse> Man.

[2:03:49] <+necrocannibal2> I think you will
[2:03:52] <marvel877> Is this Prey?
[2:03:53] <+glgzephyr> maybe there's a key somewhere
[2:03:53] <yourliteraldog> it's a 20th century house
[2:03:53] <%Mendin> Can you shoot the light?
[2:03:54] <omnishadeee> door lock defeats alien gun
[2:03:56] <willsin4fun> The only me is me. Are you sure the only you is you
[2:03:57] <+Mcmoblin> are you the astronaut? how do you know?
[2:03:58] <%rottingpastry> it's a roguelike, you must earn your way
[2:03:58] <vilecrois> With how many respawns and teleports you've gone through, it's not hard to imagine a version of you has gone rogue
[2:03:59] <%za7az> Calling it now: you are an alien shapeshifter that used her memories as the basis
[2:03:59] <DianaTheAscian> something is prob watching u through the window
[2:04:04] <+allups> camera could zoom over u should like a horror game or something
[2:04:04] <+glgzephyr> walked right into it LUL
[2:04:21] <Louie_Salmon> At this point it seems more likely this is just the life flashing before her eyes during the crash
[2:04:30] <+Photonicfab> profound statement
[2:04:31] <%0dokuro> They feel real good to shoot
[2:04:37] <Hydrapissed> yep
[2:04:37] <+allups> yeah
[2:04:39] <%Arancet> fuck yeah you are
[2:04:39] <+allups> YES
[2:04:40] <%0dokuro> yup
[2:04:40] <+Mcmoblin> Yeah sorta
[2:04:41] <%Mendin> I am digging the sekiro stagger bar
[2:04:42] <Louie_Salmon> Or Isaac
[2:04:43] <%radda343> was that statue dabbing
[2:04:44] <%valriot> LUL
[2:04:45] <+GenesisKnight> Yep
[2:04:45] <+Veraverse> Directed by Hideo Kojima
[2:04:45] <Quikanims> is this game just a rogue like?
[2:04:47] <+JobbedBone> risk of rain
[2:04:47] <ergulor> more or less
[2:04:48] <puse9> it is
[2:04:50] <sirtommygunn> Makes me nervous when he checks loot before finishing the fight
[2:04:52] <$RealThiele> thank god no corsair
[2:04:54] <ThDark> I like that description, wish I could play this
[2:04:55] <+NohbdyIsCrash> A little but better movement?
[2:05:00] <+Mcmoblin> It's definitely a bullet hell shooter
[2:05:01] <%0dokuro> This game is a rouge like
[2:05:02] <+dirkfunk1> a 9 foot alien mommy should be chasing you in this
[2:05:03] <SomeAsianDood> yes the game's a rogue like @Quikanims
[2:05:05] <+allups> thats my favorite rougelike
[2:05:07] <Louie_Salmon> Risk of Rain is definitely the most direct comparison
[2:05:07] <%Emperor_Machinus> sooo risk of rain 2?
[2:05:13] <sirtommygunn> Wish I was good at Gungeon
[2:05:14] <+Mcmoblin> A triple A, rogue like bullet hell
[2:05:15] <TopTierHarley> the rain sound
[2:05:24] <+Veraverse> Yooo menu ASMR
[2:05:27] <+glgzephyr> too much reading LUL
[2:05:29] <+Veraverse> Never leave the menu
[2:05:30] <%GarbageNirvana> Sure would be nice if I could get my hands on a PS5 so I could try this
[2:05:31] <%cvp5127> is this fun
[2:05:32] <%Agami23> the adrenaline system reminds me of terraria's calamity mod
[2:05:33] <%AzureGale> Why would I use an alien rifle as a condom though
[2:05:34] <+necrocannibal2> third
[2:05:36] <jon651> whoa very IMMERSION when you look at your menu
[2:05:37] <%0dokuro> I just love that the parasites you get stick to your arms and you can see that.
[2:05:39] <%MrBorisMakarov> too well
[2:05:41] <Quikanims> i remember this game's advertising using a bunch of fancy words that basically means it's a high budget rogue-like
[2:05:42] <+glgzephyr> I beat the game on my second run
[2:05:46] <+Veraverse> Awesome
[2:05:47] <+CookieCutter007> is it 70 dollar fun
[2:05:48] <%bevyrage> AY
[2:05:49] <%Arancet> @PatStaresAt read the database entry for the spitmaw
[2:05:51] <%hamborgini> wall

[2:05:55] <%rottingpastry> suspicious
[2:05:56] <%W1nterTitan> shoot wall
[2:05:57] <+Gespens> secret wakll!
[2:05:58] <%0dokuro> Bra
[2:05:58] <$Afterman_> was that not a breakable wall
[2:05:59] <+Mcmoblin> I'm on my 7th run :(
[2:06:00] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> i feel like if lost planet 2 was a rogue-like, this would be it

[2:22:48] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  notice how that was not a futuristic-looking astronaut; that looked like a contemporary NASA era astronaut
[2:22:48] <%skizzuto> presumably the one lying infront of you on the ground

[2:23:24] <%arcielardor> it's an extra life
[2:23:25] <yourliteraldog> NIEL I DONT WANT Your Figma
[2:23:25] <+GenesisKnight> Flexed by leaving his action figure behind
[2:23:25] <$Afterman_> so it was pat sized
[2:23:28] <+glgzephyr> oh man you're totally the astronaut
[2:23:30] <+GenesisKnight> you've had that for a while
[2:23:30] <radix865> when it upgraded
[2:23:30] <%Arancet> that shield is the Hardened perk
[2:23:31] <+ChaosAethr> you always had it
[2:23:32] <+Gespens> that's a freelife, by the way
[2:23:32] <Teyaric> When it Upgraded
[2:23:33] <dashmatt> parasite
[2:23:34] <%bevyrage> you got it when you unlocked the hardened trait
[2:23:35] <%skizzuto> when you got the permanent trait, enhanced protection, I think
[2:23:35] <+allups> had it for a while
[2:23:36] <%dekkitout> Just standing there. Menacingly
[2:23:36] <%rottingpastry> I think that's hardened
[2:23:36] <%CalderGaming> He'll Keep Coming
[2:23:38] <hot4dukat> She is inside her own mind.
[2:23:39] <%AzureGale> A trait, perhaps
[2:23:39] <Deceptimus> That shield is for proficiency.
[2:23:42] <%Arancet> @PatStaresAt shield is the Hardened trait
[2:23:43] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> when you level it up
[2:23:46] <jin_kazamaru> Hardened?
[2:23:57] <%s1rcuit> "It's a giant 3ft tall statue"
[2:23:57] <%bevyrage> hardened trait
[2:24:00] <$Afterman_> hardened
[2:24:02] <$Afterman_> increase prot
[2:24:03] <%RoboticAnimeDude> its hardened i think
[2:24:06] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> So how gross is TOO gross for an alien parasite if it gives you powers?
[2:24:07] <%DarthFreeman> Personal item: IT WILL NOT LET YOU GO
[2:24:13] <%Raikouija> guns are cool, but guns with a shield are cool as fuck!

[2:24:34] <$Afterman_> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid if it has to crawl into my eyeball, consume it from the inside, and replace it
[2:24:34] <%Arancet> @PlaidisTheNewPlaid when goo comes into play
[2:24:35] <$RealThiele> long as the parasite dont mess with my hands feet face and pp we good

[2:27:22] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> You are The Storm that is approaching
[2:27:23] <+johnnychopsocky> the blue doors are worth going through
[2:27:25] <%bevyrage> @baka_sugoi it's a rogue-like, there is no off-screen
[2:27:34] <+Zeromaru2> maybe the next time you open a teleport node?
[2:27:34] <jbrachob> oh shit reverse triforce
[2:27:35] <+StatesmanPrimal> legally distinct samus
[2:27:38] <DianaTheAscian> this feels like one of those rouge-likes where the run is like 8 hrs @PatStaresAt

[2:27:43] <%Jekado> oh no dementors!

[2:28:41] <%Arancet> @rumtumtugnutz they are not, youll know Phrike when you see it
[2:28:47] <%ItIsSky> It's wild to think that is the same team that made Super Stardust and Resogun
[2:28:48] <ReaversEdge45> Oh shit, elmo scared me lol
[2:28:51] <%dekkitout> It's fine

[2:28:55] <%josstil> that was just an effect
[2:28:55] <%za7az> @Raikouija Pat :)
[2:29:01] <%Mendin> Maybe the ominous meat cube opened it
[2:29:03] <vilecrois> oh thats def the kind of teleport that kills you and just makes a clone on the other end
[2:29:03] <%Mendin> or it was a barrier
[2:29:05] <%Agami23> thats obviously one of those "destroy yourself on a molecular level and repair it on the other side" teleporters
[2:29:06] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah that's some nightmare star treck shit.
[2:29:07] <%rottingpastry> no,  no, it looks good, it just looks like it feels horrible
[2:29:11] <jon651> reduced to atoms and then reconstructed
[2:29:12] <+allups> nah its fine just itchy after
[2:29:16] <%Raikouija> @ItIsSky A 2D team made THIS!
[2:29:19] <+ALazo> teleport? Oh, you mean the disintegration and cloning machine
[2:29:24] <%za7az> or Jim
[2:29:30] <+ikantreeed> damn the character ZOOOOMIN
[2:29:34] <+StatesmanPrimal> like i said, as long as they upload my full brain scan it's still me
[2:29:36] <Devbob98> Did Pat fight boss yet?
[2:29:37] <+glgzephyr> @PatStaresAt Remember that health pickups at full health are just heart pieces, which means that you're leaving max health on the ground by not scouring the map LUL
[2:29:39] <+allups> thats a long ass walk i wouldnt go back LUL
[2:29:44] <+ikantreeed> Why does it gives me Metroid Prime vibes?
[2:29:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> Use translocate
[2:29:50] <%0dokuro> He's close to the boss, not yet.
[2:29:55] <+StatesmanPrimal> Kitana
[2:29:55] <%dekkitout> I was not expecting space swords
[2:29:57] <$RealThiele> metroid prime map
[2:30:00] <%rottingpastry> it's a xeno-type blade tool, weeb
[2:30:10] <DianaTheAscian> looks super gross
[2:30:11] <%hamborgini> um akchully it's a space japanese katana sword
[2:30:12] <+Veraverse> Watch out, the teleporter is a gap to another reality. The only me is me. Are you sure the only you is you?
[2:30:15] <%Monkeyweed21> the unbirther
[2:30:21] <%0dokuro> I can feel the atoms ripping apart from that teleport.
[2:30:21] <jon651> Octopus? Cthulhu?!
[2:30:24] <%AzureGale> Get some aspirin
[2:30:24] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> our agony is agony
[2:30:26] <%MrBorisMakarov> cthulu
[2:30:27] <+allups> question mark....
[2:30:27] <dmtjinni> PogChamp
[2:30:27] <DianaTheAscian> Oh god that sounds awfull
[2:30:28] <%Agami23> @ikantreeed exploring alien enviroments that are harsh and unforgiving while getting data entries that help piece together whats going on.
[2:30:32] <Phlaminngooo> Octopus upstairs is just "Cthulhu in the sky"
[2:30:34] <captainnathaniel> octopus upstairs ay?
[2:30:34] <Devbob98> The Octopus is key to all of this
[2:30:37] <ReaversEdge45> Space tentacles?!?
[2:30:38] <DianaTheAscian> cool
[2:30:39] <user_naim> ”That’s... Mall Ninja Shit. That can’t be here!”
[2:30:40] <%Raikouija> thats the icon of sin
[2:30:41] <%josstil> look at that concept art
[2:30:41] <+necrocannibal2> that looks SATANIC
[2:30:46] <+StatesmanPrimal> I mean, if there IS another me we'll work together, that's a constant of my mind
[2:30:48] <$RealThiele> totally not a cult
[2:30:52] <+glgzephyr> @PatStaresAt The shop is right next to you and you have money
[2:30:59] <%rottingpastry> playing them devil games
[2:31:16] <+allups> dont be playing dem devils games
[2:31:16] <user_naim> if i had to guess, the aliens tried eternal life and totally succeeded
[2:31:22] <DianaTheAscian> that wasn't so bad
[2:31:24] <+skeletonmilk> just joining stream now. is this game good? should i buy it?
[2:31:26] <%Agami23> yellow eyed statue
[2:31:28] <yourliteraldog> This raises the qeustion if Aliens independently came up with katanas or did they visit earth
[2:31:28] <TopTierHarley> translocate
[2:31:32] <+allups> put me back where ya found me
[2:31:32] <%thedankestmeeme> you finished? or you done?>
[2:31:34] <%DarthFreeman> Explore the  sides from that Dope Room
[2:31:37] <+NohbdyIsCrash> Gameplay wise, this is everything I could want. Story, setting and lore, are my worst nightmares and thoughts I never want to confront.
[2:31:37] <+StatesmanPrimal> it's like funny valentine, we have a shared ideal
[2:31:37] <+GenesisKnight> there was a teleporter in that room
[2:31:47] <ThDark> Yellow eyes statue here
[2:31:48] <TopTierHarley> also yes shoot yellow eyed statue
[2:31:53] <%hamborgini> looks like there's a money statue in here
[2:31:55] <theshillman> @yourliteraldog katana is the one universal constant
[2:31:55] <%0dokuro> Aliens are just weebs, thats why we have sword
[2:32:04] <$RealThiele> generosity alert
[2:32:05] <+allups> ez pick
[2:32:05] <Devbob98> Did Pat go back to that secret room he fell down and buy something?
[2:32:06] <+glgzephyr> emergency repair is *very good*
[2:32:08] <+abrupt_abe> Auto repair feels vital
[2:32:13] <deviljhojho_> THATS tasty
[2:32:16] <+StatesmanPrimal> katana is the only truth
[2:32:27] <TopTierHarley> @Devbob98 once you leave that room no longer exist
[2:32:38] <%0dokuro> Its really good
[2:32:39] <theshillman> katana is the parasitic god-mind
[2:32:39] <%RoboticAnimeDude> its extremely good
[2:32:41] <+glgzephyr> @abrupt_abe It's not vital if you're not getting hit, but it's very useful early on
[2:32:42] <voodoo_zombie_dx> This is the "not deadspace" correct?
[2:32:45] <DianaTheAscian> this seems really solid
[2:32:46] <%Agami23> also one in the store
[2:32:46] <%s1rcuit> I'd play it, but I don't have a PS5
[2:32:48] <theshillman> all culture was created to spread katana
[2:32:49] <ThDark> Also a yellow eye statue in shop
[2:32:50] <captainnathaniel> you havent even gottten to the good stuff
[2:32:55] <%Raikouija> if you told me that there would be a AAA rougelite made and not by an indie company, I would have called you insane
[2:32:58] <Teyaric> It'sl ike, Control level of SHINY and FANCY but a couple generations more worth of DETAIL too
[2:33:02] <+StatesmanPrimal> while you were busy exploring the stars I was studying the blade SwiftRage
[2:33:06] <%josstil> i like cool sci-fi thing
[2:33:07] <$RealThiele> YEAH, THE SURGE
[2:33:09] <+allups> i wish the greens popped as much as the red and yellow does in this game
[2:33:11] <omnishadeee> theres not many AAA or so rougelikes/rouglites
[2:33:16] <+glgzephyr> hmmmmm
[2:33:19] <%0dokuro> Thats a Giger Door
[2:33:21] <yourliteraldog> Thats a gieger
[2:33:23] <Devbob98> But wait about Anthem ...
[2:33:25] <%Raikouija> fancy door
[2:33:26] <%rottingpastry> anathema
[2:33:28] <%MrBorisMakarov> rad

[2:33:30] <AoG_JarlRaven> I’d pick this up when I finally get a ps5 at retail
[2:33:32] <Deceptimus> Looks like the progenitors from Alien.
[2:33:32] <+GenesisKnight> boss fight?
[2:33:33] <sirtommygunn> ?
[2:33:34] <$RealThiele> stargate-ass door
[2:33:36] <DianaTheAscian> a lot of sci-fi games aren't great
[2:33:38] <%rottingpastry> anthem is anathema for sure
[2:33:42] <Phlaminngooo> Get on in that hole, boy
[2:33:42] <%ejackalope> so pat, what do you think is big twist?
[2:33:42] <%0dokuro> Boss fight boss fight boss fight
[2:33:43] <+glgzephyr> @Devbob98 Anthem...isn't a roguelike
[2:33:44] <%bevyrage> white shadow? from minori-team???
[2:33:48] <+StatesmanPrimal> I wish the surge 2 had more personality
[2:33:51] <DianaTheAscian> or big studio sci-fi games I should say
[2:33:55] <Mattais88> This feels like it will break into Aliens vs Predators at any moment
[2:33:58] <MAX116030> make bets
[2:33:59] <+allups> giant boss???
[2:34:00] <%josstil> boss time

[2:35:27] <Calek> I appreciate the immediate design choice of multiple health bars
[2:35:27] <ThDark> Phrike as a name reminds of Hyperion, the Shrike
[2:35:28] <%bevyrage> oh he do combo now

[2:40:47] <%BappoTheMighty> If so, it looks super cool.
[2:40:50] <+abrupt_abe> Unfed pod is a nickname
[2:40:56] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt Did you read about the carbine?
[2:41:03] <LoneFonte> @BappoTheMighty Yeah
[2:41:08] <aiutare47> Phrike is the Greek goddess of horror

[2:41:17] <%Raikouija> parasite is a good boi
[2:41:18] <ThDark> Parasite is FRIEND
[2:41:20] <LoneFonte> it's the warframe helminth LUL
[2:41:24] <Mattais88> Full body Stone Mask
[2:41:24] <%DarthFreeman> The  aesthetic design of this game's enviroments feel like the Chozo Ruins or Aether Temple Grounds from Metroid Prime 1 and 2. While they don't look the  same they *feel* similar.
[2:41:24] <Djinnazz> this is MY hole!
[2:41:24] <+Veraverse> #TeamParasite
[2:41:24] <%CalderGaming> it's Helminth!

[2:41:33] <+StatesmanPrimal> my parasite is my friend apriThreat
[2:41:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> @BappoTheMighty The stream info says it is so I imagine it must be.
[2:41:34] <%josstil> dem darn kids doing their parasites in the back alleys
[2:41:34] <+glgzephyr> I don't believe so
[2:41:36] <captainnathaniel> read the pod one
[2:41:38] <+AWanderingKenku> Since it helps you, isn't it a symbiote?
[2:41:42] <%ejackalope> why does everything xeno always have the same colors?
[2:41:44] <ergulor> it was there
[2:41:44] <%RoboticAnimeDude> i don't think so
[2:41:47] <ergulor> in that coiled room

[3:00:05] <TheresAGoff> Im queueing up for what seems to be the last Trial of Stormblood. I thought that Stormblood was meant to suck, I thought it was pretty good.
[3:00:06] <+glgzephyr> you're not even climbing the mountain yet  LUL
[3:00:20] <rReizs> minimap probably shows the path a bit
[3:00:25] <+dirkfunk1> +
[3:00:26] <%Mendin> Captain Kirk is climbing the mountain. Why is he climbing the mountain?
[3:00:28] <%bevyrage> NO
[3:00:32] <%bevyrage> DO NO- dammit pat
[3:00:35] <%radda343> stormblood doesn't suck,it just comes after heavensward and before shadowbringers
[3:00:36] <TopTierHarley> not evcen worth it
[3:00:36] <%rottingpastry> just shove it on
[3:00:38] <TopTierHarley> even*
[3:00:39] <$RealThiele> ass bug
[3:00:43] <%bevyrage> it's a bad buff for an awful debuff
[3:00:45] <Floofiie> @TheresAGoff It's good, just people prefer the others
[3:00:45] <%Raikouija> parasites are frens not foes
[3:00:50] <%The_Gaming_Karp> What does the 2nd parasite you got do?
[3:00:51] <%GarbageNirvana> Wonder if endgame basically has you turning into Kerrigan
[3:00:52] <%rottingpastry> he has an artifact that gives stagger with parasites
[3:00:55] <+allups> so this is what i wanted out Risk of Ran
[3:00:55] <+glgzephyr> it's okay, let him experiment
[3:00:57] <+Gespens> Proficiency is basically EXP
[3:00:58] <+upandadam> RAGE
[3:01:00] <%Mendin> The more parasites, the bigger stagger from your artifact
[3:01:09] <+allups> risk of rain 2 that is
[3:01:09] <TheresAGoff> How good is Shadowbringers then?
[3:01:13] <Meekest> You need time stop
[3:01:20] <ergulor> but it look like there are stairs
[3:01:20] <%2017y> did pat fight sans undertale yet
[3:01:25] <+allups> lul
[3:01:26] <%The_Gaming_Karp> just walked by a glyph before falling
[3:01:28] <$RealThiele> yeyeyeye
[3:01:32] <+allups> this pit is less friendly
[3:01:32] <%Mendin> @TheresAGoff The Best
[3:01:33] <%Raikouija> not for long
[3:01:33] <%bevyrage> melee might work on this guy
[3:01:40] <Vyskus> @TheresAGoff It's my favorite final fantasy, it's pretty damn good
[3:01:41] <theshillman> did pat even try to look inside the tall building?

[3:04:57] <+RandyFistburgers> anybody know if pat an paige are planning to revisit outlanders after it's gongshow release?
[3:05:07] <Cerabret100> @zekana yes it does
[3:05:11] <%rottingpastry> Phrike is technically a sentient, right?
[3:05:21] <+abrupt_abe> Real outer gods insanity vibe here
[3:05:27] <zekana> thats good to know.  wish more shooters had that
[3:05:30] <%goose_attack_almanac> @zekana Guns recharge ammo, but on expending the entire clip it has an active reload component that buffs the gun for a bit
[3:05:35] <%rottingpastry> bonus damage bad
[3:05:39] <+redthebaron> yeah old gods stuff really weird selene

[3:07:56] <Djinnazz> hate those guys
[3:08:01] <+allups> and bitch slapped right back nice job
[3:08:11] <+RandyFistburgers> This game seems very tentacle forward
[3:08:20] <+glgzephyr> @LionKagura He's been dashing the whole time...?
[3:08:22] <%Mendin> Ah it's the "normal" version of Skrike or whatever that boss was called
[3:08:26] <DianaTheAscian> sounds like sentients are a hive mind race
[3:08:32] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt you hit triangle to read the info on the weapons
[3:08:36] <+allups> indeed @RandyFistburgers
[3:08:40] <%Maids4lyfe> can you shoot it?
[3:08:48] <%Raikouija> that was easy
[3:08:55] <+allups> just a big face huger
[3:08:56] <Cerabret100> these are challenge rooms
[3:08:58] <+StatesmanPrimal> I appreciate this game's progressive attitude toward tentacles
[3:08:58] <captainnathaniel> there was
[3:09:04] <rReizs> challenge room baybee
[3:09:11] <%bevyrage> remember melee
[3:09:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> butthole door

[3:09:21] <Ardailec> Cheevo
[3:09:25] <+allups> nice
[3:09:35] <ThDark> Remember pat, you studied the blade
[3:09:41] <+StatesmanPrimal> blessed be the consentacle
[3:09:48] <%Raikouija> parasite save you!
[3:09:52] <reonome> wow the parasitet saved you
[3:09:55] <%Raikouija> towniHypers
[3:09:59] <%Mendin> Pat shield pod
[3:10:03] <+RandyFistburgers> I really like the bullet hell style attacks
[3:10:04] <+abrupt_abe> F
[3:10:04] <%Raikouija> rip
[3:10:05] <+glgzephyr> @PatStaresAt There was info on the weapons. You just didn't see the prompt to hit triangle.
[3:10:05] <reonome> F
[3:10:06] <DianaTheAscian> 2
[3:10:07] <LordOfThePoultry> F
[3:10:09] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> ded
[3:10:09] <+liquidzr0> FeelsAmazingMan
[3:10:11] <%rottingpastry> run over
[3:10:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> this was a bad room
[3:10:13] <%Raikouija> F
[3:10:13] <%Mendin> ripperoni
[3:10:13] <%0dokuro> F
[3:10:15] <+allups> why did an astronaut study the blade again
[3:10:15] <AllenDeadman> well....
[3:10:17] <%ejackalope> f
[3:10:17] <+StatesmanPrimal> pat needs to play more touhou to get better at bullet hell
[3:10:18] <+ChaosAethr> 3
[3:10:20] <rReizs> weren't there health pickups
[3:10:22] <Dunmarkh> f
[3:10:29] <%luftraumm1> live, die, repeat
[3:10:34] <%bevyrage> there was a health pickup but he got knocked out of it
[3:10:36] <captainnathaniel> there was
[3:10:36] <%Raikouija> Here we go again
[3:10:43] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah that's different
[3:10:44] <+allups> i go bac kin
[3:10:45] <+glgzephyr> but every gun has a description when you hit triangle. There must havew been a missed input
[3:10:47] <LordOfThePoultry> you still have that thing on your back
[3:10:49] <%rottingpastry> enter hole
[3:10:54] <+StatesmanPrimal> while you were reading about tentacles I was studying the blade
[3:11:00] <%Raikouija> you were yeated out?
[3:11:00] <%W1nterTitan> I love how fucked up your suit looked near the end of that run
[3:11:01] <+transporterthesequel> Uhhh
[3:11:03] <+galactichype> Actually like the Nier + Control gameplay
[3:11:05] <+transporterthesequel> Something broke IN
[3:11:10] <BlueBiscuitGT> sleep maybe?
[3:11:13] <+allups> ship got blasted
[3:11:14] <+redthebaron> is there a in lore reason for things to repeat
[3:11:14] <akitanito> what
[3:11:20] <%bevyrage> the hole goes in on the outside, but it goes out on the inside
[3:11:21] <+RandyFistburgers> Is that your church ship? Seems pretty holy
[3:11:23] <%Monkeyweed21> YEP
[3:11:26] <+glgzephyr> LUL
[3:11:28] <+allups> yeah
[3:11:31] <%baka_sugoi> somthing poked in
[3:11:31] <reonome> monkaS
[3:11:33] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:11:34] <%luftraumm1> teleporter still on your back
[3:11:36] <+StatesmanPrimal> ye
[3:11:36] <Venseeto> @redthebaron yes
[3:11:37] <DrStinkers> HOLD ON
[3:11:39] <+abrupt_abe> Cargo bay?
[3:11:42] <%rottingpastry> it did say you have some weird cargo
[3:11:42] <%bevyrage> OH
[3:11:43] <marvel877> That's what caused the crash
[3:11:43] <+ChaosAethr> Where is it
[3:11:45] <Phlaminngooo> If you check the computer is DOES say there's something in the cargo hold
[3:11:45] <Louie_Salmon> Visual Calculus - Medium (Success)
[3:11:46] <%strugglepunk2> Visual Calculus PASSED (EASY)
[3:11:46] <Dunmarkh> you got shot down maybe? big tentacle?
[3:11:52] <Link232> God damn that's some 10 Perception right there
[3:11:56] <+galactichype> Good point
[3:11:56] <%baka_sugoi> its a xeno LUL
[3:11:57] <+allups> nah i think ur looking at it wrong look at the edges see how they curv in to the ship
[3:12:05] <smallgamingchannel> lol @Louie_Salmon
[3:12:07] <+RandyFistburgers> Something broke out?
[3:12:09] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt thought she got hit by a meteor or sometrhing?
[3:12:12] <+Pendragwn> @allups ????
[3:12:13] <mr_saturday93> I thought I was a lighting strike or something but shoot down?
[3:12:17] <cosmicdischarge> you got shot down
[3:12:27] <+transporterthesequel> There's like, a 75% chance YOU are in the cargo bay
[3:12:37] <+glgzephyr> @allups it seems like you think Pat is saying the opposite of what he actually said
[3:12:46] <%CoffeeKaiju> dammmn pat just rolled a huge perception check
[3:13:07] <+allups> @glgzephyr LUL ur right
[3:13:16] <+galactichype> The real cargo bay was the friends we made along the way
[3:13:19] <+RandyFistburgers> Damn, ship aint give a fuck
[3:13:45] <smallgamingchannel> @PatStaresAt quantum time shit?
[3:13:55] <Ardailec> Was this his first death?
[3:13:55] <mr_saturday93> it's weird how pat can miss something obvious but when it comes to investigation he's sudden omnipotent
[3:14:06] <Louie_Salmon> The classic Rogue-like staple
[3:14:07] <+transporterthesequel> There is no way that ain't on purpose, the suit usage being accurate thing.
[3:14:08] <+glgzephyr> hey, you get ether for it
[3:14:08] <lvl_mania> pat you can equip different suit in the ship
[3:14:08] <%rottingpastry> aaaand I'm out
[3:14:10] <DianaTheAscian> @Ardailec 2nd
[3:14:13] <Srthunda> krustysteve in the top 3 again I see
[3:14:23] <+glgzephyr> MOVE AND SHOOT
[3:14:29] <Ardailec> @DianaTheAscian thanks
[3:14:41] <%rottingpastry> abr always be running
[3:15:17] <+RandyFistburgers> Those def remind me of the spore tyranids from 40k
[3:15:40] <Phlaminngooo> You need that adrenaline 5 money buff
[3:15:41] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> Holy shit Pat have you seen the Japanese RE8 commercial with the puppets? could understand a word, shit was a riot
[3:15:47] <therealtacopancakes> did he die on mars?
[3:15:59] <%luftraumm1> it's so weird seeing a roguelike with this amount of money, usually roguelike are exceedingly simple to account for exchanging assets, I wonder how much this game changes
[3:16:09] <%muXPerience> It's SpaceMars
[3:16:10] <%0dokuro> Basically MArs
[3:16:10] <+glgzephyr> it's technically just the other side of the planet
[3:16:11] <+allups> marlit
[3:16:12] <Deceptimus> Pat, Get your ass to mars.
[3:16:15] <+transporterthesequel> You should probably get your ass to mars
[3:16:27] <DianaTheAscian> its cool though
[3:16:27] <corepercentlives> the setting is awesome
[3:16:28] <+RandyFistburgers> This is permadeath?
[3:16:29] <Blank9> more roguelikes would be good if they have good gameplay
[3:16:34] <+Slattsquatch> AAA Risk of Rain 2
[3:16:35] <Dunmarkh> is it really a roguelike without ascii?
[3:16:36] <$Ziegsy> The chances of patstaresat living on mars, were a million to one they said
[3:16:42] <%bassoontyphoon> Im genuinely shocked at how polished this game is. When I saw the trailer I was not convinced
[3:16:42] <+RootVeggie> This is the feeling that Deep Down was supposed to invoke
[3:16:43] <marvel877> He died on Ceti Alpha V
[3:16:45] <%luftraumm1> is this the first high end roguelike?
[3:16:50] <smallgamingchannel> is that someone fucking screaming in there
[3:16:51] <%RoboticAnimeDude> part of why this game rules
[3:16:55] <%rottingpastry> mistake get
[3:16:58] <%radda343> do you have to do the whole first area again if you die? I hate that shit.
[3:16:59] <therealtacopancakes> what is the ps5 controller doing in this game? does it feel tentacly?
[3:17:00] <+allups> @Slattsquatch 100% what i thought too
[3:17:01] <mr_saturday93> Has there ever been another rogue like AAA game like this?
[3:17:07] <rReizs> GOBLIN POISON
[3:17:08] <%muXPerience> yo when the chests are crying, it's not a good sign
[3:17:10] <+StatesmanPrimal> I wonder how many years this was in development
[3:17:16] <Louie_Salmon> The only worry I suppose is how procedural it is, you might see patterns repeat a little too soon
[3:17:21] <%ssjklyco> Proper use of big money, better
[3:17:29] <Srthunda> it matters as much as knowing how to use it
[3:17:32] <marvel877> Money gets you one more round, you drink it down, you stupid clown.
[3:17:37] <%luftraumm1> @radda343 everytime the areas change so technically you never redo anything
[3:17:44] <%bevyrage> melee shields?
[3:17:44] <+allups> @mr_saturday93 other then side modes i cant think of any or anything this close to good
[3:17:47] <+Gespens> you can melee the shielded enemies
[3:17:47] <+transporterthesequel> Sword?
[3:17:49] <+spinalwizard> sword it?
[3:17:52] <LordOfThePoultry> @Louie_Salmon that happens in all roguelikes eventually
[3:17:53] <+StatesmanPrimal> yeah, knowing what to do with your money is far more important
[3:17:54] <DianaTheAscian> try sword? @PatStaresAt
[3:17:54] <rReizs> sword that fucker
[3:17:55] <%rottingpastry> you have weapon effective against red
[3:17:55] <%RoboticAnimeDude> you have to melee pat
[3:17:56] <%Monkeyweed21> sword it
[3:17:56] <Dre_> you have to use the sword on it
[3:17:56] <$insaneintentionsyo> this isn't pokemon snap PokPikachu enigmaKEK
[3:17:57] <+Zeromaru2> the Sword doesn't work on them?
[3:18:03] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Sword on Sheild
[3:18:04] <+glgzephyr> @Louie_Salmon The different biomes provide enough variety on their own to make up for that inevitablity
[3:18:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> You can sword it
[3:18:18] <%bevyrage> if it red cut it dead - this message brought to you by kaytanna
[3:18:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> red juice is USE SWORD
[3:18:26] <Phlaminngooo> Blessed money shower
[3:18:27] <%bassoontyphoon> Sword the turret you big silly
[3:18:45] <dynamic_funk> hows the game?
[3:18:46] <theshillman> BIG STUMBO
[3:18:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> you can't gun it, but you brought a knife to a gun fight
[3:19:01] <Dunmarkh> the turret runs on dune rules I guess
[3:19:19] <%Raikouija> Game gets Pat's stamp of approval!
[3:19:21] <%ssjklyco> Coming Soon, Battle Royal Rogue Like
[3:19:24] <captainnathaniel> ddoes that mean you are going for a full LP of this?
[3:19:30] <%The_Gaming_Karp> one of those games too stressful for me to play but really entertaining to watch
[3:19:34] <+allups> tbf he missed a massive mechanic
[3:19:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> It honestly feels like a Pat game
[3:19:38] <+spinalwizard> The Slow blade penetrates the shield!
[3:19:38] <Cerabret100> This is genuinely probably the first roguelike that i actually enjoy and don't bounce off of after like 4 runs
[3:19:40] <%rottingpastry> happy shield
[3:19:42] <DianaTheAscian> well pat u are a pro streamer @PatStaresAt
[3:19:54] <+allups> that too ofc
[3:19:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> Like how Gungeon feels like a pat game
[3:19:57] <+Aggro_Will> Sword the Turret is my favorite Trigun villain and/or Sonic character.
[3:20:02] <%Deft_Thought> Sup chat. Sup Pat.
[3:20:02] <+JustToWatch> also a fair bit of RNG
[3:20:04] <+transporterthesequel> I mean, literally actually I guess.
[3:20:06] <yourliteraldog> Your skills in fortnite prove this
[3:20:07] <+StatesmanPrimal> pat big pro, super cool
[3:20:08] <smallgamingchannel> I am an amateur media consumer
[3:20:12] <+Mrbaconator> pat your massive dick helps you do game good
[3:20:12] <marvel877> Pro Fornite Streamer Pat.
[3:20:16] <%DarthFreeman> @PatStaresAt Please give us some of your Pro Streamer Wisdom.
[3:20:16] <%Monkeyweed21> remember Gene is a game journo @PatStaresAt
[3:20:17] <leinadtonu> a humble pro streamer
[3:20:17] <%Deft_Thought> How's Returnal been
[3:20:20] <%kknutson4> Your Fortnite wins have levelled up your 3rd person shooter skills
[3:20:20] <%radda343> if you have to repeat an area youve already passed this is a hard pass from me, I hate that shit
[3:20:20] <%Raikouija> I mean you do hit the back pat
[3:20:22] <akitanito> pp grow big
[3:20:22] <mr_saturday93> Yes big painis
[3:20:24] <therealtacopancakes> would paige like this?
[3:20:28] <+allups> my dick only help me game bad
[3:20:29] <+RandyFistburgers> Like a log im sure
[3:20:31] <Phlaminngooo> Pat's basically better than Ninja
[3:20:33] <+liquidzr0> WubTF
[3:20:35] <mr_saturday93> PP BIGGRR THSN PAIGE
[3:20:35] <smallgamingchannel> BIG PP GONE
[3:20:35] <marvel877> Notable FFXIV streamer Woolie.
[3:20:36] <+allups> :/
[3:20:38] <+Pendragwn> that big pp is what pierced the ship
[3:20:41] <Zeif00> Does your mom still think you're a pro gamer?
[3:20:46] <+StatesmanPrimal> @patstaresat how do you walk around with such a huge penis?
[3:20:47] <+spinalwizard> Sword the Turret is my fav alternate reality Run the Jewels
[3:20:50] <%bassoontyphoon> these enemies remind me of the matrix tbh
[3:20:51] <+RandyFistburgers> big pp rights revoked
[3:20:51] <rReizs> this gun seems busted
[3:20:53] <+Aggro_Will> It's a game about a lady who gets lost and dies all the time. Of COURSE Paige would be drawn to it.
[3:20:54] <+fetrigon> is eugene skillup?
[3:20:55] <yourliteraldog> I can't wait until pat gets banned from fortnite for killing ninja
[3:21:00] <%Agami23> a good amount of hitstop
[3:21:00] <%CoffeeKaiju> I hate that it looks like theres a small rain cloud chasing him???
[3:21:02] <godzookylives> DOUBT
[3:21:07] <mr_saturday93> Who's penis is bigger paiges or pats?
[3:21:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> @radda343 They were pretty clear that it was a roguelike metroidvania, repeating areas is kind of a genre hallmark
[3:21:15] <+JustToWatch> what gun does Pat have?
[3:21:29] <ReaversEdge45> “It feels gooood, yea”
[3:21:29] <+allups> @CoffeeKaiju now that u said it its all i can see
[3:21:29] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt i think you need to do the whole map again on these challenges, including the boss fught
[3:21:32] <+transporterthesequel> You are very big and strong for this area, I am glad that light perma-progression is a thing
[3:21:34] <%muXPerience> are they parasitizing her suit or her body
[3:21:39] <theshillman> what do oobliets do anyway?
[3:21:43] <%rottingpastry> ha loki
[3:21:45] <%radda343> @rumtumtugnutz and that's why I don't play roguelikes, I was hoping this was different
[3:21:46] <%Deft_Thought> Why not both
[3:22:00] <%CoffeeKaiju> @allups I'm sorry fellow viewer....
[3:22:03] <%Raikouija> lewd ashuLewd
[3:22:08] <%rottingpastry> get groped
[3:22:08] <%DarthFreeman> LEt them touch you
[3:22:11] <%Deft_Thought> That's spooky
[3:22:11] <XelanArdel> does the game use the controller vibration or haptics well?
[3:22:12] <+spinalwizard> Rougelite!
[3:22:15] <%Agami23> i want to touch glowey tentacles
[3:22:16] <%luftraumm1> man I've been watching a lot of Isaac streams lately, and I gotta say the roguelike genre has come very far
[3:22:19] <+Pendragwn> let the hentai tentacles touch
[3:22:19] <+StatesmanPrimal> why not both indeed, it's probably like metroid fusion where the suit is like a symbiotic second skin
[3:22:38] <smallgamingchannel> I heard that it's gamecube esque
[3:22:43] <+allups> they needa bring that PS5 controller shit to PC
[3:22:49] <+Based_Moose> The sound design is amazing
[3:22:54] <%The_Gaming_Karp> I like how things just vaporize when you look at them
[3:22:59] <Cerabret100> its got a two stage pull for left trigger, half for aiming, full for alt fire
[3:23:00] <+BigBruthaThunda> game good?
[3:23:01] <%Raikouija> @smallgamingchannel think mario sunshine when a half press does something different to a full press
[3:23:13] <theshillman> is oboliets money?
[3:23:15] <%Arancet> the fungi boys?
[3:23:28] <%DarthFreeman> @PatStaresAt Let the glowy tentacles caress your baby-smooth  skin
[3:23:41] <%luftraumm1> this is a very impressive game, although the time loop trope is being beat a lot these days
[3:23:47] <Cerabret100> also the rumble has some real weird sensations that i think are supposed to be like rain, but being creepy alien world who knows
[3:23:59] <%Agami23> or the best kind
[3:24:01] <%ChestMimik> Cringe, even
[3:24:02] <+StatesmanPrimal> let the tentacles tell you the legends of their people
[3:24:02] <Phlaminngooo> But....based
[3:24:02] <%DarthFreeman> tentacle-basting
[3:24:03] <smallgamingchannel> based tentacles
[3:24:05] <%Broand> Based? based on what?
[3:24:08] <+RandyFistburgers> ten tickles
[3:24:08] <%bassoontyphoon> BASED???!?
[3:24:10] <%MidnightBurst12> i think you mean best
[3:24:11] <+glgzephyr> @luftraumm1 if it means anything, this is *definitely* not your average time loop
[3:24:11] <Dunmarkh> there are worse ways to die
[3:24:12] <+Bael_Lord_of_End> AYAYA
[3:24:12] <BlueBiscuitGT> Almost 5am here, have fun chat and Pat
[3:24:13] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> tentacles arent a THREAT
[3:24:19] <%Monkeyweed21> at least they arent redpilled
[3:24:24] <Dunmarkh> @Broand tentacles
[3:24:36] <The_Legendairy> when it gets chaotic is it hard to tell the good glowies from the bad glowies?
[3:24:39] <DrStinkers> which is still much better than tentacle cringe
[3:24:39] <rReizs> as adrenaline is a style meter that gives you bonuses
[3:24:47] <+StatesmanPrimal> unfortunately since she's in a time loop she'll experience many ways to die
[3:24:54] <%Monkeyweed21> pat how
[3:24:55] <+glgzephyr> notice that you haven't overloaded once
[3:25:03] <%Raikouija> nailed it
[3:25:06] <Phlaminngooo> Nice recover
[3:25:07] <+StatesmanPrimal> smokin sexy stylin
[3:25:09] <%kknutson4> So is this game basically Risk of Rain 2 with bigger budget?
[3:25:14] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Missed Chest
[3:25:20] <+geckosheer> you just posted tentacle cringe, u will lose subscriber
[3:25:24] <ThDark> Wasn't there a chest up there?
[3:25:37] <+StatesmanPrimal> chest missed pepeHands
[3:25:38] <+glgzephyr> @kknutson4 smash a ton of Metroid Prime in there and you got it
[3:25:42] <%luftraumm1> I want to see how much build variety you can get
[3:25:58] <%luftraumm1> risk of rain 2 seems to be way more zany
[3:26:00] <%rottingpastry> you may have gun or gun
[3:26:07] <%bevyrage> ramp on the left, platform platform
[3:26:22] <+Brightstreak> pat, how many black shirts do you have? gimme a ballpark
[3:26:33] <%luftraumm1> getting good platforming in a roguelike is absolute madness
[3:26:46] <%CoffeeKaiju> omg I hate this rain vinyetting
[3:26:50] <+spinalwizard> At least 3
[3:26:52] <%luftraumm1> try hundreds
[3:26:53] <smallgamingchannel> not enough I say
[3:26:54] <%Dakuu75> chat... wtf was that question? lol
[3:27:04] <+StatesmanPrimal> at least 300
[3:27:06] <Zeif00> I love that you're constantly covered in space goo
[3:27:10] <+Brightstreak> no reason. just asking, thanks
[3:27:19] <+allups> flying dudes always suck to fight
[3:27:23] <ThDark> They show up on the mini-map the whole time at least
[3:27:25] <%rottingpastry> git gud
[3:27:26] <+glgzephyr> @Brightstreak that's pretty creepy dude
[3:27:44] <Phlaminngooo> Especially flying dudes that tackle you
[3:27:59] <%Deft_Thought> Risk of Rain 2 is very wild space fantasy. This at least has the aesthetic veneer of science fiction in a wild ass Metroid temple
[3:28:04] <%red_cuppa> how's returnal?
[3:28:04] <+allups> i find it really hard to notice the map, least as a viewer
[3:28:12] <%rottingpastry> maybe there will just be stairs
[3:28:30] <%xemnahort> How’s the game so far?
[3:28:33] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Just got here hows the game?

[3:28:52] <%rottingpastry> dead lava octopus
[3:28:53] <Phlaminngooo> It's all goo all the way down
[3:28:56] <Smitteys867> this game looks dope and pats having a good time
[3:28:58] <%Raikouija> where is the end of this challenge run?
[3:29:00] <theshillman> he will nver try to shoot those things will he?

[3:29:56] <+glgzephyr> I prefer interference sphere to ground spike
[3:29:58] <Ner234> Pat you can't just go around giving things the goo. D:
[3:30:04] <Deceptimus> Wall
[3:30:11] <Deceptimus> Destroyable wall
[3:30:18] <rottingpastry> weird that you would think that
[3:30:21] <%xemnahort> They wanted you to help them reenact their favorite anime, Inyouchuu
[3:30:26] <+glgzephyr> YOU DID IT
[3:30:37] <+Brightstreak> are there other biomes in this game?
[3:30:42] <Dunmarkh> bold move

[3:38:08] <%aishman> NEW BIOME
[3:38:09] <%radda343> see, if you can jump back to the area you were in then I'll try the game
[3:38:10] <%dekkitout> Lucky tileset or rubber banding ?
[3:38:22] <%radda343> I hate having to beat a boss I already killed
[3:38:24] <%aishman> Oh sorry thought it was.
[3:38:28] <+HaunchPaunch> This game would be great on the Jaguar
[3:38:28] <+fetrigon> nah they invested way too much into ps5 features for that to be a thing
[3:38:31] <smallgamingchannel> very old biome, then
[3:38:45] <SaltyAzteca> that is excellent! cuts down on time to rdtur and
[3:38:48] <Djinnazz> you sure? mine is.
[3:38:51] <SaltyAzteca> return, amd
[3:38:58] <SaltyAzteca> ffs keyboard
[3:39:12] <Cerabret100> @radda343 well its a little rng how soon you find the gate, but yes you only HAVE to kill the boss once
[3:39:12] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Hey guys, Pat and Woolie got me into FF14. If I want to buy Complete Edition, should I buy or Steam or from Square?
[3:39:26] <Albafica_picses> Cool room
[3:39:32] <%Maids4lyfe> square
[3:39:35] <unclerizla> Woolie got me into FF14
[3:39:35] <vile_brand> maybe time is fast forwarding like millennium every run?
[3:39:36] <+BIumen> cuboid
[3:39:39] <OkamiDude15> CUBE
[3:39:41] <smallgamingchannel> angry rubiks cube
[3:39:50] <+luketrapwalker> CUBE MONSTER LUL
[3:39:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> @wizard_of_diamonds That depends on how much of your money you want to give to Gabe Newell
[3:39:54] <+fetrigon> pat AND woolie LUL LUL LUL LUL
[3:40:01] <iq_dropper> I brough it on Steam personally
[3:40:02] <yourliteraldog> I wonder how long it is between loops
[3:40:05] <%Deft_Thought> Losing buffs after getting hit seems pretty punishing
[3:40:06] <%Maids4lyfe> that looks like the tentacle monsters from Edge of Tomorrow
[3:40:13] <%xemnahort> @wizard_of_diamonds square usually has more frequent sales but that’s about it I think
[3:40:20] <%Deft_Thought> But your mobility looks really good, so I guess it balances out
[3:40:21] <%The_Gaming_Karp> all these monsters remind me a neurons which make me wonder
[3:40:29] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @rumtumtugnutz Fair. Any differences in features or something? I checked and didn't see any but wanted to be sure
[3:40:32] <Jaysky> The enemy attacks just make me think of Nier bullets
[3:40:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> Functionally identical.
[3:40:50] <iq_dropper> not really wizard
[3:40:54] <%xemnahort> @wizard_of_diamonds there are no other differences
[3:40:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> I bought it from Greenman cause I had a 22% off code
[3:40:58] <%radda343> @Cerabret100 maybe I'll find time for it after RE8 then
[3:41:15] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Thanks lads :)
[3:41:19] <Smitteys867> can u shoot the glowy?
[3:41:19] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt those were just the baby ones
[3:41:24] <%Raikouija> YOOOOO
[3:41:24] <Cerabret100> @wizard_of_diamonds whichever one you pick is where you have to keep all your purchases, can't mix and match for future expacs, that's about it
[3:41:27] <+glgzephyr> they pumped your weapon level up to five, that way you get thisd power boost @PatStaresAt
[3:41:33] <$RealThiele> G U N
[3:41:33] <%bassoontyphoon> Its a real shame this isnt on PC because I would buy this in a heartbeat
[3:41:39] <%xemnahort> @patstaresat maybe the gun you got is really good?
[3:41:50] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @Cerabret100 I figured
[3:41:53] <%Broand> Are those glowing white things anything?
[3:41:58] <yourliteraldog> that would make sense
[3:41:59] <+glgzephyr> @xemnahort Nah his gun was shit prior to right now
[3:42:01] <dan_g_v> seems like it
[3:42:09] <+luketrapwalker> biomewitdaba
[3:42:17] <%rottingpastry> glowy thing
[3:42:17] <+transporterthesequel> My guess is that's how it works yeah, the game alters itself to get you to the next biome faster per each boss killed
[3:42:20] <%rottingpastry> what is?
[3:42:29] <%thedankestmeeme> Biomware hah
[3:42:40] <+allups> it reminds me of remnant from the ashes progression
[3:43:01] <+glgzephyr> wait did he just ignore the door?
[3:43:15] <+StatesmanPrimal> I liked the scp style they went for in remnant
[3:43:22] <SomeAsianDood> it was locked no point
[3:43:24] <%thedankestmeeme> tentacles iinstead of tree's and girl's instead of guys monkahmm
[3:43:25] <%hax_metatron> No Disco today?
[3:43:34] <+allups> least for the flyers its seems
[3:43:38] <%dekkitout> Good reticle friction or good bullet magnetism?
[3:43:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> @glgzephyr No key
[3:43:43] <Jaysky> Doubt since this is sponsered
[3:43:44] <%luftraumm1> you already at Mars?
[3:43:45] <dan_g_v> auto aim?
[3:43:47] <+Dives__> Positioning more important than aiming
[3:44:03] <+StatesmanPrimal> it looks more like reticle friction
[3:44:17] <yourliteraldog> I think the gun pat has equiped is has tracking shots like the needler
[3:44:25] <$RealThiele> +1 to GUN
[3:44:35] <+glgzephyr> oh no
[3:44:42] <+glgzephyr> that debuff sucks to play with
[3:44:43] <+xiccy> your big pat head is in the way of the health bar
[3:44:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think since Pat is enjoying Returnal that it means Disco is off the table, as it was presented as a backup plan.
[3:44:52] <%DarthFreeman> Chest
[3:44:59] <%DarthFreeman> You never got your chest loot
[3:45:05] <+allups> yea we also arent playing
[3:45:09] <%Raikouija> Bloody Screen! (So real...)
[3:45:24] <+StatesmanPrimal> I remember gears of war
[3:45:25] <%rottingpastry> it's meh
[3:45:26] <%DarthFreeman> Oh wow no that's trash
[3:45:33] <$RealThiele> did left side pat kill right side pat?
[3:45:33] <+allups> ez
[3:45:34] <+xiccy> but then how would i know for sure?
[3:45:44] <+glgzephyr> turn parasites into gold LUL
[3:45:44] <%DarthFreeman> cenntipede iron maiden
[3:45:44] <DianaTheAscian> oh
[3:45:45] <%Deft_Thought> Huuuh
[3:45:46] <yourliteraldog> you sell it
[3:45:48] <%rottingpastry> ah if only you had taken that terrible parasite
[3:45:55] <%Raikouija> rip off parasite and get monies
[3:45:56] <%luftraumm1> should a got it
[3:46:00] <%radda343> see wha happun
[3:46:01] <smallgamingchannel> oh god
[3:46:01] <%Jekado> reminds me of warframe
[3:46:02] <+glgzephyr> very dead space
[3:46:03] <yourliteraldog> that one seems pretty bad
[3:46:04] <Mattais88> Reject your humanity!
[3:46:10] <%abusywizard> ooh big hug
[3:46:13] <$Afterman_> iron maiden
[3:46:17] <%luftraumm1> warframe boil remover
[3:46:17] <+allups> yeah very deedspace
[3:46:17] <+Gespens> you can use it as many times as you have parasites
[3:46:18] <%Jekado> removing those... weird things on your warframe when you change them.
[3:46:22] <%muXPerience> it could have been nastier
[3:46:25] <+allups> yes i love that
[3:46:28] <$Afterman_> call it a xeno maiden
[3:46:28] <+RowenCleric> that was less horrifiyng then I expected...
[3:46:30] <%aishman> This is a really fucking cool rogue-lite, holy shit
[3:46:32] <+Gespens> Bahroo had a parasite he REALLY wanted to get rid of and he ended up having to get rid of his full set when he had the bonus stagger for parasites.
[3:46:35] <%aishman> I need a PS5 for this game
[3:46:37] <+HaunchPaunch> Biotech
[3:46:45] <rReizs> yo alien you seem cool get in
[3:46:47] <%rottingpastry> what are you talking about I'm a white dude all technology is meant for me
[3:46:48] <%Deft_Thought> You're not made of tentacles and thoughts! Get the hell out of here!
[3:46:53] <%muXPerience> alien ai like 'wtf is this kid so jampacked with parasites'

[3:47:05] <+StatesmanPrimal> I want a ps5 FeelsBadMan
[3:47:05] <%Agami23> this game gives me the bad brain tingles, but it feels like its suppost to. which is good
[3:47:13] <Kango234> The traversal in this game looks so fun
[3:47:15] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt you gonna play more of this?
[3:47:21] <iq_dropper> man I haven't Warframe in a year. How is it doing now?
[3:47:24] <deviljhojho_> i have a ps5 but i only have like two games for it

[3:48:18] <+StatesmanPrimal> it really depends on your tastes honesly
[3:48:22] <deviljhojho_> WORM WORM WORM WORM WORM
[3:48:29] <%dekkitout> @iq_dropper long story short, it has even more redundant features and now you can swap out 1 frame ability for another
[3:48:30] <$RealThiele> god damn it
[3:48:34] <+StatesmanPrimal> worm apriPoggers
[3:48:34] <deviljhojho_> thats not a worm

[3:49:11] <%Raikouija> * LUL
[3:49:12] <smallgamingchannel> you'd think she'd have something to say lmao
[3:49:14] <+Zeromaru2> did you get the glyph?
[3:49:15] <%Agami23> i think maybe he pushed you away and saved you
[3:49:19] <deviljhojho_> the ol double tap

[3:49:27] <+fetrigon> NOW FUCK IT
[3:49:32] <+Nekolaius> do you only have one weapon in your loadout? cant hold 2+?
[3:49:33] <+fetrigon> yeeeeeeeee
[3:49:33] <Louie_Salmon> Overload disabled seems rough
[3:49:40] <+glgzephyr> it's the reload mechanic
[3:49:40] <%king_wragles> Disabled is what
[3:49:41] <%rottingpastry> active reload
[3:49:42] <$RealThiele> axiom verge issue maybe
[3:49:43] <fatalDestiny> The active reload thing
[3:49:44] <%Arancet> overload is the active reload
[3:49:46] <%RoboticAnimeDude> the reload mechanic
[3:49:46] <Deceptimus> Overload is instant reload
[3:49:48] <rReizs> active reload
[3:49:54] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Overload Reload
[3:50:06] <+HaunchPaunch> @PatStaresAt So does every new gun feel different with the Dualsense controller?
[3:50:09] <+glgzephyr> the nice thing is how easy it is to clear most malignant stuff
[3:50:10] <+lucaspaul22> all the weapons in this second phase are very good
[3:50:11] <%Arancet> adrenaline level
[3:50:12] <+Gespens> your bonus damage stat
[3:50:21] <Dre_> adrenaline
[3:50:22] <%Arancet> adrenaline level increases the little missles
[3:50:23] <+xiccy> Adrenaline buff
[3:50:26] <%DarthFreeman> You activated Max Adrenaline
[3:50:29] <%Agami23> adrenaline?
[3:50:41] <%DarthFreeman> :^)
[3:50:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> its cause your adrenaline is maxed
[3:50:42] <%Arancet> still says 5.0
[3:50:50] <%rottingpastry> one of those is a sword
[3:50:54] <yourliteraldog> dont look a gift horse in the butt
[3:50:55] <rReizs> nah you didn't have melee back then
[3:50:56] <+glgzephyr> pretty sure that 5 is max
[3:51:01] <$RealThiele> adrenaline adds options is neat
[3:51:02] <iq_dropper> I see, I've been playing FFXIV and Yakuza so I wasn't following it's updates
[3:51:14] <+xiccy> See? If your big pat head wasn't in the way we would know for sure!

[4:00:38] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> the weapons you get in Remnant FTA are gonzos
[4:00:58] <%rottingpastry> I wish the adrenaline boost didn't look like you just got hit for massive amounts of damage
[4:01:05] <Devbob98> Did Pat die or go back to old area?
[4:01:19] <%radda343> eyeball room
[4:01:28] <+glgzephyr> @Devbob98 You can't go back without dying
[4:01:44] <smallgamingchannel> definitely didn't get killed by erno rubik himself
[4:01:48] <+StatesmanPrimal> Pat's a big dick gamer of course it was on purpose Kappa
[4:01:52] <%Dakuu75> what's adrenaline, in this game?
[4:02:12] <+StatesmanPrimal> it's your style meter pretty much
[4:02:15] <%Agami23> @Dakuu75 you kill enemies and get buffs, but you lose them on taking too much damage.
[4:02:17] <%Kingkaiju0618> Kingkaiju0618 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! just joined, this game worth anything?
[4:02:17] <rReizs> adrenaline is style and buffs
[4:02:18] <+glgzephyr> @Dakuu75 Kill enemies without dying for big bonus
[4:02:20] <%rottingpastry> buff for not getting hit while murdering
[4:02:38] <+glgzephyr> @Dakuu75 Sorry, without *getting hit*
[4:02:45] <%RoboticAnimeDude> ye the hollowseeker rules
[4:02:53] <akitanito> what did void beam do
[4:03:08] <Dre_> akitanito its just a beam
[4:03:10] <+glgzephyr> @akitanito Voidbeam kills shit dead
[4:03:12] <%rottingpastry> shoot a laser
[4:03:15] <%Dakuu75> doesn't Enter the Gungeon hav a mechanic like that? where if you clear rooms without gfetting hit, you get more money or loot?
[4:03:24] <%Sanyle> so i know literally nothing about this game, is this basically a triple a roguelike?
[4:03:25] <%Agami23> @akitanito shoots a beam that does big damage but is very thin.
[4:03:45] <DXLelouch24> Max LOVED this gun
[4:03:46] <+glgzephyr> @Sanyle that's exactly what it is
[4:03:47] <%Agami23> @Sanyle i'd say double A but yeah
[4:03:57] <%RoboticAnimeDude> the voidbeam also does more damage the longer its used on the same enemy
[4:04:06] <%rottingpastry> immediate damage for something that will go away soon lol
[4:04:10] <+Kobrafan79> I feel like this game sales are gonna be hurt because of the ps5 shortage
[4:04:15] <%radda343> you were close to solving the malfunction anyway
[4:04:16] <+glgzephyr> @Agami23 how is this not AAA?
[4:04:16] <%king_wragles> You were like 20 bucks away from getting rid of that malfunction too
[4:04:18] <akitanito> cool, so better for big enemies
[4:04:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think its technically a rogulite
[4:04:25] <%Sanyle> it looks cool, how is it? I might buy it if i get the chance
[4:04:37] <%king_wragles> It would've been great if it indicated whether or not it'd get used automatically
[4:04:52] <+StatesmanPrimal> apex sphere apriPog
[4:04:58] <akitanito> apex nooooo
[4:05:01] <%rottingpastry> It did
[4:05:05] <%rottingpastry> It said "fixes or prevents"
[4:05:06] <Devbob98> Stealing alien creatures from their home for your benefit, is this Colonialism?
[4:05:17] <%Agami23> @glgzephyr theres a certain weird jank look to it that makes it feel like double A instead. kinda reminds me of setsuna hellblade if that makes sense.
[4:05:27] <yourliteraldog> thats a gud one
[4:05:30] <smallgamingchannel> oh fuck Soma vibes
[4:05:31] <%AyotoCorp> Is this one of those roguelikes which is designed to be beaten eventually
[4:05:35] <+glgzephyr> I guess I just disagree
[4:05:39] <theshillman> is apex sphere just pat when he streams apex legends?
[4:05:49] <%rottingpastry> shove fist in mechanical alien butthole, heal better for free.
[4:05:57] <%radda343> would you stick your arm into an alien machine for buffs pat
[4:06:09] <Louie_Salmon> It is so obviously death
[4:06:11] <+StatesmanPrimal> probably @theshillman
[4:06:13] <%linSP> would you?
[4:06:14] <Devbob98> He went really long before encountered an augment
[4:06:22] <%JoshManVGH> Return to goop
[4:06:23] <%rottingpastry> it makes him feel gross
[4:06:25] <puse9> molecular distortion
[4:06:26] <%RoboticAnimeDude> playing this on my oled with hdr, this is a AAA game. no way its AA at all. looks incredible
[4:06:28] <%Maids4lyfe> it's like you're being vored by cthulhu
[4:06:28] <tanarath> Regrows you from nothing, Pat.
[4:06:32] <Profmcstevie> But it's super on point for this awful awful world
[4:06:32] <smallgamingchannel> I hear more human screaming! Yaay!
[4:06:34] <akitanito> imagine all the clones from malfunctions
[4:06:35] <+glgzephyr> @Agami23 Having played it for several hours, it feels like a AAA game
[4:06:41] <+StatesmanPrimal> hey man, you must sacrifice much for the advance of science ironmouseKEK
[4:06:44] <rReizs> broken wall?
[4:06:45] <eldragon_1> Looks like the thing from Dark
[4:06:45] <+BIumen> bad as in its not good or bad like its gross and icky
[4:06:47] <+glgzephyr> there is no jank
[4:06:53] <%rottingpastry> that is a potato
[4:06:59] <+Aggro_Will> BEHELIT
[4:06:59] <Hydrapissed> the egg of GOD
[4:07:08] <laguerrilha> I though the game would have pacing issues but it seems great so far
[4:07:21] <captainnathaniel> thts a behelit
[4:07:23] <Devbob98> I’m Shocked they weren’t all traps
[4:07:28] <%Agami23> @glgzephyr i guess thats a important part i dont have perspective on. im only watching, not playing. since i dont have a ps5
[4:07:29] <+StatesmanPrimal> oh no, pat has acquired a Behelit
[4:07:32] <smallgamingchannel> gun sounds meaty
[4:07:40] <$Ziegsy> Theres a teleporter in remnant from the ashes. If another player goes downstairs underneath the room as someone teleports away, a burnt skeleton falls from the ceiling, indicating that every teleport makes a clone.
[4:08:01] <+StatesmanPrimal> yikes I didn't know that
[4:08:02] <+Aggro_Will> This game is just filled with unsettling.
[4:08:14] <%DarthFreeman> Bassy warbles make energy weapons sound beefy
[4:08:15] <+glgzephyr> @Agami23 I do get what you mean a little bit with the visuals, but it also *looks* much better in person because I have a 4K tv and the lights off and it's not being streamed
[4:08:20] <OkamiDude15> damn thats messed up but also pretty neat
[4:08:33] <Smitteys867> God the fuckin GAME F E E L
[4:08:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> AAA usually just means it's a marquee title and that it had a big budget, right? And Housemarque and Sony have both referred to it as a AAA game.
[4:08:41] <smallgamingchannel> the anti-star trek teleport system
[4:08:49] <leinadtonu> This game looks fun, wonder if it'll ever come to PC
[4:09:01] <+glgzephyr> @leinadtonu that'll never happen
[4:09:07] <$Ziegsy> If youre playing solo the room just looks like a pile of skeletons. Its only if someone uses it while another player is present that you see the skeleton drop
[4:09:07] <Devbob98> Now it’s dead, who’s the real monster?
[4:09:21] <%Mendin> Yeah with 400+ obolite that reroll seems good
[4:09:21] <smallgamingchannel> @leinadtonu maybe yeaaaars down the line ala Horizon
[4:09:24] <TheAngryArtist> is this game a roguelike? i hope not
[4:09:32] <+glgzephyr> @leinadtonu or, if it does, it'll be four years from now
[4:09:35] <%rottingpastry> stargate
[4:09:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> It is a roguelite
[4:09:44] <SomeAsianDood> fogdoor?
[4:09:48] <iq_dropper> ehh give it 5 years
[4:09:50] <TheAngryArtist> damnit.
[4:09:52] <puse9> it's the door to the stargate
[4:09:53] <+StatesmanPrimal> I mean the fact that it's being being streamed will inevitably affect how it looks
[4:09:55] <Hydrapissed> years
[4:09:55] <%rottingpastry> the thing with a stargate symbol above it leads to a stargate
[4:10:01] <smallgamingchannel> @SomeAsianDood trogdor?
[4:10:05] <Meekest> Runs get faster
[4:10:05] <vile_brand> bahroo beat it earlier
[4:10:05] <Profmcstevie> few hours in a run I hear
[4:10:09] <Ardailec> I've heard they can go 2 hours
[4:10:10] <captainnathaniel> depends on your skills
[4:10:13] <puse9> I heard there are 6 levels
[4:10:14] <+StatesmanPrimal> stargate PogChamp
[4:10:18] <%Ranryu692> yeah, the lack of a save and quit option is appearing less and less acceptable
[4:10:18] <yourliteraldog> What do you get if you beat the stage boss on replay
[4:10:18] <+Gespens> Bahroo took about 2 hours for a loop
[4:10:19] <+JenovaS> it took me 4 hours for a full one
[4:10:25] <Devbob98> I’m guessing people can get by with standard gear and blaze through it
[4:10:27] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt I think Max had a 5 hour run last night
[4:10:34] <smallgamingchannel> I would like to see if there's special shit if you beat it the very first run
[4:10:55] <%JD_Lars> Nothing on HowLongToBeat yet
[4:10:56] <+StatesmanPrimal> and I assume you won't get the whole story just by beating a run
[4:10:56] <Cerabret100> i think you get stuff to speed it up, i read the crimson wastes can be completely skipped at a certain piont
[4:11:00] <%AyotoCorp> Gamespot says 5 hours for a section
[4:11:00] <Louie_Salmon> If you're being careful and scraping, yeah 6 beefy levels would take that long
[4:11:01] <%rottingpastry> to be fair max spent like 20 minutes finding a door he left behind
[4:11:04] <Profmcstevie> Most roguelikes peak at an hour a run
[4:11:08] <+glgzephyr> @StatesmanPrimal absolutely not
[4:11:21] <smallgamingchannel> reviewers said around 40 for all content?
[4:11:27] <+StatesmanPrimal> excellent, yeeeeees
[4:11:27] <puse9> and Max never reading LUL
[4:11:27] <Louie_Salmon> Which I suppose makes the requests for a save function more sympathetic.
[4:11:37] <TheAngryArtist> am i alone in my hatred of roguelikes? i feel like they make half a game with a dope combat system, then give up on designing levels, randomly generate them and say its a feature.
[4:11:42] <%rottingpastry> takes 2 hits to lose adrenaline yaaay
[4:11:53] <%0dokuro> You can eventually skip biomes, though you wont have the possible upgrades from them @PatStaresAt
[4:11:53] <laguerrilha> Didnt Hades runs last almost 2 hours?
[4:11:55] <%MeyB_7> hey sorry if you already got this question pat but whens Fortnite?
[4:12:03] <%rottingpastry> you've seen ground surge before wtf
[4:12:11] <+StatesmanPrimal> well, the real pull for me is a different build each run
[4:12:12] <+glgzephyr> @TheAngryArtist These levels aren't randomly generated, only the order is
[4:12:19] <%StebTheVee> So how is the game and the saves?
[4:12:20] <Louie_Salmon> @theangryartist Well they're designed rooms, just mish-mashed.
[4:12:38] <%linSP> so how do you save between runs?
[4:12:38] <smallgamingchannel> @Louie_Salmon right, that's exactly what this is
[4:12:43] <BioApple> @laguerrilha 30-40 minutes, 15 once you git gud
[4:12:43] <%linSP> mid run i mean
[4:12:44] <puse9> Power geyser!
[4:12:46] <%Ranryu692> @laguerrilha maybe your first or second full run, but no, Hades runs are like 45 minutes to an hour
[4:12:48] <+glgzephyr> @TheAngryArtist yeah this take seems bad to me
[4:12:57] <Profmcstevie> God this game just relentlessly lives in the aesthetic of my nightmares, I LOVE IT
[4:13:00] <%Areus> triHmm
[4:13:06] <$KnivesEve> @PatStaresAt hey fortnite looks cool now
[4:13:16] <%JoshManVGH> @glgzephyr talking biome order or room order is mixed up?
[4:13:17] <+glgzephyr> YEYEYE TIME FOR HOUSE
[4:13:19] <+Gespens> protection is a damage reduction
[4:13:21] <TheAngryArtist> i just prefer games with linear progression, i guess.
[4:13:21] <+Zeromaru2> We back at the house
[4:13:24] <smallgamingchannel> oh shit resVII
[4:13:31] <+glgzephyr> @JoshManVGH Room order
[4:13:44] <%JoshManVGH> It's Thomas Zane
[4:13:44] <smallgamingchannel> oh god PT
[4:13:44] <DianaTheAscian> oh boy this again
[4:13:50] <+EdHeng> PT?!
[4:13:50] <laguerrilha> PT
[4:13:51] <smallgamingchannel> oh fuck it's space PT
[4:13:55] <TheAngryArtist> even dark souls doesnt force you to start over from scratch when you die.
[4:13:56] <SomeAsianDood> This seems like a bad fucking idea
[4:13:59] <%linSP> rougelite PT
[4:14:00] <theshillman> don't touch that dial
[4:14:00] <Louie_Salmon> I guess I feel for people upset at everything being Rogue-likes, they all kick ass and I'm fed like a king so yay
[4:14:05] <+StatesmanPrimal> PT apriPoggers
[4:14:07] <yourliteraldog> now we got pills
[4:14:09] <%rottingpastry> this has pretty linear progression, just dying is expected
[4:14:12] <%Agami23> wait i just noticed. it said this is a 20th century house and it is. but what year does this take place? this has fancy space ships and stuff.
[4:14:13] <%SpaghettiTime44> Is this this Housemarque game?
[4:14:15] <smallgamingchannel> she touched the dial; we're dead
[4:14:16] <yourliteraldog> Eat the pills
[4:14:16] <%rottingpastry> at least that's the way it looks
[4:14:19] <Cerabret100> oh shit i'm bouncing to avoid spoilers gl on the rest

[4:14:41] <akitanito> anti parasite drug
[4:14:41] <pilllowofbees> their vitamins
[4:14:42] <%barkon345> @Louie_Salmon but this is a rouge-lite
[4:14:42] <%rottingpastry> the drug is husband
[4:14:43] <leinadtonu> forgetinol forte

[4:14:55] <Dunmarkh> viagra
[4:14:59] <smallgamingchannel> dark hallway don't wanna be walked
[4:15:01] <$MachoMadnesss94> that hallway is very pt
[4:15:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> @TheAngryArtist There are permanent upgrades, but the hook of the game is that its taking place in a time loop.
[4:15:03] <puse9> fuck no!
[4:15:05] <%Mendin> That door must bever be opened
[4:15:06] <%linSP> nice art mom
[4:15:07] <ThDark> What a nice painting
[4:15:10] <Devbob98> 8:36 is snack time
[4:15:10] <DianaTheAscian> oh look a urn @PatStaresAt
[4:15:12] <+EdHeng> that's pretty metal
[4:15:16] <%The_Gaming_Karp> more neuron motifs
[4:15:18] <SomeAsianDood> fun times
[4:15:19] <fatalDestiny> That is an appropriate picture to have in your house, for sure.
[4:15:21] <%The_Gaming_Karp> I'm thinking brain issue
[4:15:22] <+StatesmanPrimal> the fact that they actually put eye meds for her is very lore friendly
[4:15:23] <smallgamingchannel> oh god no
[4:15:24] <ammobasket> sick, bruh
[4:15:25] <%radda343> you don't know, maybe she's into red goo
[4:15:27] <+glgzephyr> I love this part
[4:15:43] <%Maids4lyfe> I just noticed her breath fogs the face plate
[4:15:48] <AoiRob> does she have dementia. is that what the game is about
[4:15:48] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> incoming text wall XD
[4:15:50] <%rottingpastry> nothingness had a feeling
[4:15:52] <+Epic_Fubar> this p.t?
[4:15:53] <Louie_Salmon> @barkon345 Yeah but they're adjacent genres. And most Rogue-likes are Rogue-lites anyway
[4:15:53] <akitanito> oh thank god
[4:15:54] <BioApple> most roguelikes aren't even "procedurally generated" the way, say, minecraft is. They're hand-designed arenas stitched together in a random order
[4:16:03] <DianaTheAscian> oh
[4:16:04] <%bravebravesrobin> Majulaesque tune there
[4:16:06] <smallgamingchannel> mass effect pog
[4:16:07] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Mass Effect fic?
[4:16:10] <%rottingpastry> Tali? That's the wrong space game
[4:16:25] <laguerrilha> After Yakuza 0 those music boxes never unsettle me anymore
[4:16:29] <puse9> We'll bang ok?
[4:17:03] <Devbob98> The writer on this game worked hard
[4:17:17] <Louie_Salmon> "That status hadn't been accurate for objective years" did I read that correctly?
[4:17:21] <AShinyVagikarp> uhnHm
[4:17:23] <$Ziegsy> I hate this writing style. So internal rather than describing the environment
[4:17:31] <%rottingpastry> the void-womb is my nickname for my wife
[4:17:50] <Devbob98> And her name was the Doom slayer
[4:18:05] <vVAstrAVv> i hate the way pat reads the top most line
[4:18:23] <%CalderGaming> ＮＥＣＲＯ－ＰＨＹＳＩＣＳ
[4:18:23] <Louie_Salmon> This is some super abstract stuff
[4:18:30] <laguerrilha> I read like that too. whats wrong with that?
[4:18:33] <%barkon345> @Ziegsy what do you hate about it?
[4:18:36] <%thedankestmeeme> i'm jelly of how smooth he reads
[4:18:36] <%dekkitout> Necro-WHAT?!
[4:18:38] <smallgamingchannel> n e c r o p h y s i c s
[4:18:41] <%thedankestmeeme> it always puts me to sleep
[4:18:47] <+slickrick1121> looooooooorrrrreeeeee
[4:18:49] <ThDark> Huh?
[4:18:50] <DianaTheAscian> wtf was that
[4:18:51] <%JoshManVGH> Time to go to the Beach
[4:18:56] <vVAstrAVv> reading the bottoms more comfy
[4:18:57] <%luftraumm1> tamsyn Muir got to her eh
[4:18:58] <%Broand> That totally was a book version of one of her other runs

[4:19:04] <%thedankestmeeme> he a pill poppa
[4:19:05] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Yeah, how many pills does she need?
[4:19:07] <Louie_Salmon> A comical amount of pill bottles
[4:19:07] <smallgamingchannel> is this a strand game?
[4:19:10] <smallgamingchannel> is this the beach?
[4:19:10] <%Caped_Eggy> Oh shit PT time?
[4:19:19] <+TheAutisticCowboy> NECRO-PHYSICS? EXCUSE ME?
[4:19:29] <yourliteraldog> Chronos
[4:19:31] <Devbob98> Maybe she hoards pill bottles like me?
[4:19:32] <morningmoondude> oh man, relatable. windows always updates when i need to use it.
[4:19:32] <akitanito> this is why you use linux
[4:19:34] <%rottingpastry> I'm sorry Chronos does what now
[4:19:34] <+glgzephyr> L E T  M E  I N @PatStaresAt
[4:19:36] <+TheAutisticCowboy> We got physics of the dead now?
[4:19:39] <$Ziegsy> if shes dead and this is purgatory Im going to slap a bitch

[4:20:40] <%rottingpastry> light's back

[4:21:59] <%Caped_Eggy> Blood?
[4:21:59] <smallgamingchannel> is that what the cube monster is?????
[4:22:01] <yourliteraldog> It's a hell cube
[4:22:03] <akitanito> beef bullion
[4:22:06] <%Caped_Eggy> Bloodborne?
[4:22:12] <%Mendin> It's a variation on the teleporer physics, whatever it is
[4:22:23] <%linSP> astra sus
[4:22:26] <+transporterthesequel> Oh that is 100% a secret ending trigger, the blocks
[4:22:30] <T_Sasquatch> @glgzephyr honestly i hate when games have surpise horror sections. I still remember the far cry 4 shit they pulled
[4:22:32] <Devbob98> You dummy
[4:22:38] <%rottingpastry> In a better timeline where Astra rejected her
[4:22:40] <%thedankestmeeme> ok
[4:22:46] <+TheDoopad> Sounds like Ash from TitanFall/Apex
[4:22:47] <+Gespens> Is this a Jacob's Ladder situation?
[4:22:59] <+glgzephyr> @T_Sasquatch I would say that these sections are much closer to a thriller than a horror film
[4:23:02] <%CalderGaming> ｗｅｒｅ ｙｏｕ ｅｖｅｒ ｓｕｐｐｏｓｅｄ ｔｏ ｂｅ ｉｎ ｔｈａｔ ｓｈｉｐ
[4:23:02] <%luftraumm1> or is she not even in space?
[4:23:18] <+glgzephyr> DID she ever get the job?
[4:23:21] <akitanito> all a dream
[4:23:21] <laguerrilha> as long as its not a dream or simulation i am ok with it being a limbo type ending
[4:23:25] <pilllowofbees> PogChamp this is fanfiction
[4:23:30] <LordOfThePoultry> timey whimey fucky whucky going on here
[4:23:33] <%rottingpastry> secret hunting!
[4:23:38] <puse9> it's a radar
[4:23:42] <leinadtonu> Maybe this is al a simulation?
[4:23:53] <%JoshManVGH> @gespens oh this is TOTALLY a Jacob's Ladder situation!
[4:23:55] <irlScoundrel> @PatStaresAt how you liking the game so far?
[4:23:55] <%rottingpastry> it permo
[4:23:58] <puse9> it's an artifact
[4:24:06] <+glgzephyr> @leinadtonu that alone wouldn't explain the time fuckery present
[4:24:12] <%rottingpastry> oh nm
[4:24:19] <%rottingpastry> I probably dumb
[4:24:26] <+StatesmanPrimal> oh god it might be Jacob's Ladder
[4:24:27] <%BinaryFireball> is the game good?
[4:24:30] <laguerrilha> I hated Prey ending
[4:24:31] <smallgamingchannel> right, the tension can be blown out
[4:24:35] <deviljhojho_> just a dream is enough to kill a story yeah
[4:24:37] <+glgzephyr> @rottingpastry nah u right
[4:24:41] <%Caped_Eggy> Cheap way out
[4:24:43] <Devbob98> There’s no stakes
[4:24:45] <%linSP> it was all a dream, i used to read word up magazine
[4:24:49] <+StatesmanPrimal> I was actually fine with how they did it in Prey
[4:24:49] <$Ziegsy> Eternal Sonata does it Amazingly
[4:24:51] <Louie_Salmon> Every story is just a dream the author wrote
[4:24:52] <%Maids4lyfe> just a dream only worked once
[4:24:52] <captainnathaniel> @PatStaresAt didnt one of the alien texts talked about "octopus upstairs"? like the one you just saw?
[4:25:02] <smallgamingchannel> damn good point
[4:25:02] <%Caped_Eggy> Reality is worse than dream
[4:25:03] <Meltgar> Dream ending?
[4:25:05] <%rottingpastry> the premise of the matrix is that it's just a dream
[4:25:06] <+liquidzr0> ???
[4:25:09] <%linSP> like freddy krug
[4:25:09] <%rottingpastry> not the climax
[4:25:11] <%luftraumm1> just a dream can absolutely be a good plot point
[4:25:14] <Sain_127> im getting some serious dead space vibes from this
[4:25:31] <+glgzephyr> If dying in the dream means death irl, there are obviously stakes
[4:25:31] <nabs96> This game seems kinda boring so far. What do u guys think?
[4:25:34] <T_Sasquatch> it was alll a dreamm , i used to read word up magazine
[4:25:39] <+Gespens> Like Jacob's Ladder
[4:25:49] <+transporterthesequel> Oh so Eternal Sonata
[4:25:50] <laguerrilha> ah i think i understand what you mean. As long as real consequences happen right
[4:25:52] <Blank9> super nintendo, sega genesis
[4:26:01] <+StatesmanPrimal> I think it looks pretty fun, but I'm a total shill for this setting so ignore me
[4:26:02] <+Toshatron> Life on Mars is a great example of "is it just a dream tho?"

[4:26:51] <%Agami23> pathologic(the original) did the "it was all fake" thing kinda well
[4:26:59] <laguerrilha> Jacobs Ladder had effects on reality, even if he wasnt aware
[4:27:00] <%rottingpastry> the aliens woke up to violence
[4:27:02] <Devbob98> No octopus, boo
[4:27:11] <AllenDeadman> they did a fuckie wuckie

[4:30:02] <puse9> is it a cthulu
[4:30:08] <%rottingpastry> grorb
[4:30:18] <+Gespens> Like, we have a Tyranid weapon when all the other weapons are primarilty mechanical
[4:30:22] <+CptnCampy61> They most definitely fucked it
[4:30:31] <laguerrilha> Maybe the main alien force made new weapons using the enemy parts as inspiration
[4:30:50] <yourliteraldog> You know how it goes you build a super weapon and you end up using it ethier by choice or massive fuck up
[4:30:51] <%Puhff> I'm think the statue aliens prolly unlocked a doorway to some kind of interdimensial squid maybe and that's why

[4:38:14] <%hrbeck_> Get coin?
[4:38:15] <+glgzephyr> LMAO
[4:38:23] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Those tentacles remind me of that Kojima game with the monster energy
[4:38:25] <AllenDeadman> huh
[4:38:26] <%X2Eliah> uhhh
[4:38:30] <+Gespens> did you accidentally pick up a new gun? lol
[4:38:30] <puse9> you equipped it on accident

[4:38:32] <twoto858> LUL
[4:38:32] <+Gespens> new gun looks rad
[4:38:36] <%athuramn> but some crazy is hot, so more parasite = more hot?
[4:38:40] <%Puhff> the more tentacles you have, the more girlfriends you get
[4:38:41] <+Gespens> it has TWO perks!

[4:40:44] <rasamune> Cats are good
[4:40:46] <%RoboticAnimeDude> terrible humans?
[4:40:47] <+fetrigon> yeeee
[4:40:47] <+SilverInferno3> People who've been betrayed by sweet doggie or kitties
[4:40:50] <%Maids4lyfe> people who are sick
[4:40:51] <%Agami23> im allergic to my dog and break out painfully when i love on him. this does not stop me.
[4:40:55] <%radda343> I'm extremely allergic to cats but emlo is still baby
[4:40:56] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> A deep purr is the best in life.
[4:40:57] <+glgzephyr> THAT'S one thing
[4:41:04] <dero45> i love kittys they just can kill me by being close to em
[4:41:04] <+Gespens> I'm allergic to a lot of cats and dogs sadly :(
[4:41:04] <+glgzephyr> but there are people who just STRAIGHT UP HATE THEM
[4:41:05] <%Maids4lyfe> I have allergies and I still bury my face in them
[4:41:09] <%TheBensonator_> People who are FUCKIN NERRRRRDS
[4:41:10] <%hrbeck_> Sometimes my cat will fluff up JUST so we will compliment him on how big and fuzzy he is
[4:41:11] <smallgamingchannel> they little fuzzy people
[4:41:17] <%Sanyle> hes such a good boy
[4:41:17] <%Maids4lyfe> trauma is forgivable
[4:41:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> Its nice to see Elmo back on stream, he was absent for a while
[4:41:20] <Devbob98> He made of jelly
[4:41:20] <%TheBensonator_> (and those with medical conditions that prevent it)
[4:41:21] <%RoboticAnimeDude> yeah theres trauma, then theres people who are allergic, then theres just assholes
[4:41:22] <%Ranryu692> when I was a toddler, my grandma's dog was not a fan of me, and it screwed me over on dogs until I was almost 20
[4:41:31] <farrellcityking> beautiful kitty
[4:41:37] <%JoshManVGH> oh shit
[4:41:38] <%toastybites> allergies tho
[4:41:38] <laguerrilha> My mom cat almost gauged her eye out too
[4:41:42] <%JoshManVGH> Aww!
[4:41:44] <smallgamingchannel> same thing with me, but with dogs
[4:41:46] <%weissguard> d'awwww
[4:41:49] <%Puhff> JFC
[4:41:50] <stevenellis386> even if were allergic or some shit. Just look at that innocence chat
[4:41:51] <dero45> that fluffy cat would have my lung swole af
[4:41:54] <+cade_calrayn> Two of my bf's dogs are formerly abused :(
[4:41:56] <smallgamingchannel> I love /my/ dog tho
[4:41:58] <%TheLakinessMonster> Cats are knife elementals that cause me to sneeze my head off, but they are always so cute. You expect me not to pet them?
[4:42:00] <%Puhff> WHAT THE HELL CANADA CATS
[4:42:01] <%X2Eliah> Myeah feral house cats are a thing
[4:42:04] <smallgamingchannel> Max can fuck himself lol
[4:42:05] <%MelBrooksKA> Didn't your dad get fucked up by a dog too?
[4:42:06] <peyodogo> my aunt got mauled by a cat at night when she was a kid, got a huge phobia, and fifty years later she adopted a blind cat pretty much by accident. huge cat lady now
[4:42:17] <ArcaneMusic> Hey gang, how late am I?
[4:42:18] <+fetrigon> woolieKICKDAD
[4:42:35] <+JJMR322> very lol
[4:42:35] <%goose_attack_almanac> That happened to my brother when he was 3 and my family was on vacation in PEI. Just stray pissed off cat latched onto his face right out of a bush
[4:42:39] <%The_Gaming_Karp> @ArcaneMusic 4.6 hrs
[4:42:41] <%luftraumm1> very @arcanemusic
[4:42:44] <%X2Eliah> Cats can smell if you *don't* have toxoplasmosis and they Do. Not. Like. that
[4:43:04] <%athuramn> @arcanemusic right on time
[4:43:05] <%rottingpastry> the game would really like you to know there is a secret nearby
[4:43:11] <ArcaneMusic> Cool, can't wait to watch the VOD later. Good luck on High budget ROR2!
[4:43:48] <%hrbeck_> A dog picked my dad out the pram and just started shaking him by the head until my gma could fight him off
[4:43:49] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Nooooo
[4:43:51] <%MrP33Ps> psaWhat
[4:43:51] <Devbob98> You’re cute?
[4:43:55] <+Mrbaconator> people die when they are killed?
[4:43:55] <ThDark> Big brain over here
[4:43:57] <+eanscrale> Okizeme
[4:43:58] <+glgzephyr> they also can't stop you from rapid firing on their weak point LUL
[4:44:09] <+Gespens> iirc, melee kills also give more EXP
[4:44:09] <%AzureGale> When they get knocked down, they get back up again. You are never going to keep them down
[4:44:13] <%TheFabledAble> did you realize that you bitch?
[4:44:18] <%Taisuru> psaPorgmo
[4:44:20] <%TheFabledAble> <3 <3 <3
[4:44:23] <ThDark> Emlo return
[4:44:28] <%hrbeck_> When you kill them, they die
[4:44:35] <%Taisuru> EMLO SO BIIIIIIIG
[4:44:36] <%MrP33Ps> psaWink
[4:44:45] <+glgzephyr> @Gespens Do you mean weapon proficiency? I don't recall reading anything like that
[4:44:45] <%goose_attack_almanac> BABY
[4:44:52] <%Puhff> I missed the beginning but why are we even her in the first place besides the crash?
[4:44:52] <smallgamingchannel> "eatin shit n' stuff"
[4:44:55] <+cade_calrayn> how'd you get so rooooooounnndddd
[4:44:58] <OkamiDude15> elmo has become big and strong
[4:45:00] <%hrbeck_> Elmo bigger than Pat
[4:45:00] <ArcaneMusic> Eat him elmo, become STRONG.
[4:45:04] <+jaynoir> they definitely need to buff adrenalin it should wear off after more than one hit
[4:45:10] <Devbob98> He learned it from you
[4:45:10] <%emperordread> What an angel baby
[4:45:17] <%Puhff> god elmo you are huge good for you
[4:45:25] <leinadtonu> He seems curious about what you're doing
[4:45:29] <KazairLux> the B A B Y
[4:45:30] <%rottingpastry> o ok
[4:45:37] <farrellcityking> majestic kitty
[4:45:46] <%X2Eliah> This whole game feels like the Halo->Swarm areas should have feltlike
[4:45:48] <+glgzephyr> @Puhff Some ship logs indicate that you received a signal while crossing the void, where there shouldn't be anything. That's all we've got so far
[4:45:48] <%Taisuru> NOW EMLO IS SMALL
[4:45:53] <%Deft_Thought> HE SO HANDSOME
[4:45:56] <smallgamingchannel> very bio computer
[4:45:57] <+cade_calrayn> Elmo sees Space Milf and thinks "is momma?"
[4:45:59] <%radda343> very borg-y
[4:46:00] <%athuramn> well that was good timing
[4:46:01] <Blank9> from elmo's perspective pat stares at a screen and makes loud noises for 5 hours at a time while no one else is around
[4:46:02] <%MelBrooksKA> First you get the psaBig , then you get the STRONG
[4:46:06] <ammobasket> awwwwwwww
[4:46:11] <Devbob98> He pout
[4:46:13] <%radda343> time for peepee
[4:46:15] <%X2Eliah> We super can't, Pat
[4:46:16] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> awwwwwwwwwwww
[4:46:16] <%Taisuru> SEETY
[4:46:16] <%AzureGale> Cat wants loving forever
[4:46:18] <%X2Eliah> Big lies
[4:46:21] <%TallYoda08> psaWink psaWink psaWink psaWink
[4:46:22] <tanarath> I love how it's an energy katana the size of a polearm.
[4:46:24] <%AzureGale> Longcat is looooooooooooooong
[4:46:24] <KazairLux> long boi
[4:46:24] <rasamune> that's a long cat
[4:46:25] <+glgzephyr> he purr
[4:46:25] <%Ascethetic> he purr
[4:46:27] <%Taisuru> *SWEETY
[4:46:28] <smallgamingchannel> long chonk
[4:46:31] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Ppprrrrr
[4:46:31] <laguerrilha> baby happy purr
[4:46:37] <%Maids4lyfe> such loud purring
[4:46:40] <+glgzephyr> aw yeah that's that good shit
[4:46:41] <twoto858> purrrr
[4:46:41] <+JJMR322> hes so big hes small
[4:46:43] <%rottingpastry> classic
[4:46:44] <%Puhff> @glgzephyr "the void"??? is that like hysperspace or just regular space?
[4:46:47] <Dunmarkh> @tanarath A BIG WEAPON FOR BIG ALIENS
[4:46:49] <%TheLakinessMonster> psaGib psaGib psaGib psaGib
[4:46:50] <%JoshManVGH> Fluff!
[4:47:00] <+glgzephyr> @Puhff fuck if I know lmao
[4:47:03] <+Jack8274> If anyone’s crashing, disable the DLC skins
[4:47:04] <%justcallmebobplease> Can you imagine if the cat you lived with DIDN'T like to be cuddled?
[4:47:09] <%athuramn> my heart D; there's so much fluff
[4:47:18] <%hrbeck_> My cat is also big but smol, it’s so weird
[4:47:24] <%Puhff> LUL
[4:47:32] <%X2Eliah> Have you noticed any repetition in the zones/rooms?
[4:47:42] <+glgzephyr> @Puhff I think they're just referring to the space between galaxies as void. Which is fitting enough
[4:47:47] <theshillman> @justcallmebobplease yeah, my moms cat was big on hanging out but not snuggling
[4:47:49] <rReizs> some rooms have repeated
[4:48:00] <rReizs> different enemies and items though
[4:48:01] <%Mendin> Oh man a text indicator alog with the jingle, that's NICE
[4:48:04] <%Puhff> I wish the shipped talked to you a little
[4:48:09] <%Puhff> this game feels lonely
[4:48:09] <%rottingpastry> it's on the platform
[4:48:19] <%athuramn> @hrbeck_ I kinda get that. my cats are small but they have some very unflattering Jabba the Hutt poses that make make look massive
[4:48:22] <+allups> ya boy finna ta sleep have a good night guys. great stream pat and the game seems real dope
[4:48:36] <%rottingpastry> that's where it plays anyway I dunno where the secret is lol
[4:48:39] <%sabertoothzombie> which run number is this?
[4:48:57] <smallgamingchannel> nier, buy
[4:49:06] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> smash those!
[4:49:06] <+glgzephyr> hi there Alien
[4:49:07] <%rottingpastry> oh look big purple
[4:49:11] <OkamiDude15> buy, nier
[4:49:19] <+glgzephyr> THE PLANTS EVEN MAKE FACEHUGGER NOISES
[4:49:19] <laguerrilha> really want a maine coon cat. they huge  like pupper
[4:49:20] <Dunmarkh> @sabertoothzombie 5?
[4:49:21] <%UnabashedGarbage> @PatStaresAt Those purple things can drop parasites and resin and stuff
[4:49:30] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> oh PAT
[4:49:53] <pilllowofbees> was that just an alien reference LUL
[4:49:58] <+fetrigon> it means 1,000 years later in another game Kappa
[4:50:01] <+glgzephyr> it's based on your weapon proficiency @PatStaresAt
[4:50:03] <smallgamingchannel> permanent change?
[4:50:07] <twoto858> Does Weapon Proficiency carry over cycles?
[4:50:12] <%Mendin> Because you were grinding with good adrenaline combos to get higher proficiency faster
[4:50:22] <SomeAsianDood> it scales with your current weapon proficiency
[4:50:36] <+glgzephyr> your weapon proficiency is the minimum level of weapon  drops
[4:50:39] <smallgamingchannel> wait what the fuck was that sound
[4:50:40] <%FalconFlavoredPunch> pretty sure WP dies when u do
[4:50:52] <%Mendin> @twoto858 no but the start of each area has a pickup that gets you to a minimum proficiency, so you can go straight to area 2 and be not underpowered
[4:50:57] <Monnie182> is this game nuts
[4:51:13] <smallgamingchannel> I heard a plane in the sky above
[4:51:19] <twoto858> Got it
[4:51:24] <%emperordread> Like Vanquish, that game was great at weapon upgrades
[4:51:25] <%MelBrooksKA> The real secret was it was shit
[4:51:31] <%athuramn> seems quite nuts so far @monnie182
[4:51:35] <+glgzephyr> it would be nice to be able to dismantle items we haven't picked up for obolites or something
[4:51:37] <+fetrigon> @monnie182 not at all Kappa
[4:51:47] <%Agami23> haha. knot
[4:51:48] <%rottingpastry> welp
[4:51:51] <Dunmarkh> that's alright
[4:51:58] <Dunmarkh> very risk of rain
[4:52:05] <%X2Eliah> dismantling unwanted loot would be great
[4:52:19] <laguerrilha> Risk of Rain with budget
[4:52:20] <Monnie182> that radar is pretty sick honestly tho
[4:52:34] <Blank9> everyone compares it to everything and it all fits
[4:52:37] <%Mendin> It's a Gumbo game
[4:52:43] <smallgamingchannel> same
[4:52:45] <%king_wragles> Someone called it Control but roguelike and I can't stop seeing it
[4:52:46] <IntenseNerdRage> how's the game so far, I left around the start and I feel like I missed nothing based on what's going on rn
[4:52:46] <%Ranryu692> I hadn't even heard of it until today
[4:52:49] <laguerrilha> i also thought the pacing of the game would be awful since it had cinematics
[4:52:50] <Devbob98> The marketing was rough
[4:52:52] <+Kduff89> risk of rain+metroid
[4:52:53] <+Mrbaconator> returnal is very much like Video Game
[4:53:01] <+glgzephyr> the plants make facehugger noises....
[4:53:09] <+Kduff89> Yes @Mrbaconator
[4:53:16] <Monnie182> MALIGNANT pog
[4:53:20] <+fetrigon> ye same
[4:53:26] <%rottingpastry> you have magic malignancy cleanser so that's cool
[4:53:27] <kes009900> more like, no risk of rain. if rain meant flop Kappa
[4:53:28] <+Kduff89> big big videogame
[4:53:35] <SomeAsianDood> that doesn't seem that bad
[4:53:56] <Djinnazz> it's like curse
[4:53:58] <IntenseNerdRage> Maligdeeznuts
[4:54:01] <+NicDanger> this seems kinda cool
[4:54:04] <+Gespens> Malignancy causes malfunctions
[4:54:10] <CurrySauseBandit> @patstaresat You van check inside the tutorials menu.
[4:54:12] <%rottingpastry> I'd assume it makes you go the big crazy
[4:54:13] <+glgzephyr> there's a malignancy tutorial @PatStaresAt
[4:54:14] <%Maids4lyfe> it causes continuous damage to you or malfunctions your suit
[4:54:19] <%emperordread> @IntenseNerdRage 9.5 /10, would chuckle again
[4:54:20] <Monnie182> theres so many creepy crawlies man
[4:54:34] <%radda343> that's a parasite
[4:54:45] <%X2Eliah> malfunctions?
[4:54:47] <CurrySauseBandit> Malfunctions
[4:54:48] <SomeAsianDood> its just malfunction chance
[4:54:52] <@PeachSaliva> paaaaaat
[4:54:52] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Malfunctions I think
[4:55:03] <$Ziegsy> peeaaacchh

[4:56:23] <%Ranryu692> @PeachSaliva how much longer until your second dose?
[4:56:27] <smallgamingchannel> that's a fuckin robot
[4:56:30] <ArcaneMusic> He seemed friendly
[4:56:34] <Dunmarkh> ???
[4:56:37] <%king_wragles> This game is cool
[4:56:37] <@PeachSaliva> @Ranryu692 mine is on the 5th
[4:56:38] <laguerrilha> the danger zone
[4:56:39] <ArcaneMusic> Good thing you killed him before he could make that funny
[4:56:41] <%AzureGale> Why did you destory the Apex Legends lootbox
[4:56:42] <BobCarlosJunior> is the game good?
[4:56:43] <Devbob98> He did nothing to you lol
[4:56:46] <%king_wragles> Why does it have to bee $70?
[4:56:53] <@PeachSaliva> is the game good
[4:56:54] <smallgamingchannel> THIS IS MY HOLE IT WAS MEANT FOR ME
[4:57:03] <%king_wragles> It seems very good
[4:57:06] <%Ranryu692> @PeachSaliva oooh, that's soon. Are you heading back to Montreal right away after, or are you waiting the two weeks?
[4:57:07] <Meltgar> HOLE
[4:57:08] <%king_wragles> Pat's enjoying it at least
[4:57:16] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> that sounds like a terrible ideia
[4:57:22] <$Ziegsy> @king_wragles look at it. it pretty. someone has to pay for this fancy
[4:57:24] <Meltgar> That looks like a TINY CYBERDEMON LUL
[4:57:32] <kes009900> yeah, get right in
[4:57:34] <+lucaspaul22> a checkpoint if you can afford it
[4:57:38] <%jorniev> would you have restart from death powers chat?
[4:57:39] <Dunmarkh> put your head in the crotch
[4:57:41] <commanderapathy> I've been hearing very positive things about this game
[4:57:45] <Srthunda> I sorta want to play as whatever that is to be honest
[4:57:49] <%athuramn> this seems like a good idea
[4:57:50] <+wizard_of_diamonds> This hole WAS NOT made for me
[4:57:50] <KnifeyMcEdge> it's a video game, Pat
[4:57:53] <scrumbotime> it's printing a whole person thinking this horn dude must have one weird leg
[4:57:54] <+zacyzacy> I love how painfully obvious that you'll get a grappling hook later
[4:58:03] <%jorniev> oh god
[4:58:04] <Devbob98> It’s like getting an X-ray on your finger
[4:58:09] <Monnie182> fast travel animation looks so cool
[4:58:10] <+SouLucha> If it fits it fits.
[4:58:12] <smallgamingchannel> @wizard_of_diamonds :(
[4:58:22] <rReizs> "i was programmed to copy whatever comes in me so fuck it get in ayylien"

[5:01:37] <%TheLakinessMonster> While you are in the states, get yourself a box of wine from Trader Joes. Good amount of decent wine for cheap.
[5:01:37] <$Ziegsy> one wine, out of one of those boxes like a juice box
[5:01:38] <+RandyFistburgers> Also. Hi Paige!
[5:01:39] <%AzureGale> Piercings are jewelry you can put on your body
[5:01:42] <ThDark> Drank one vineyard of wine
[5:01:43] <%rottingpastry> "I think I know what piercing is; my penis is huge."
[5:01:47] <theshillman> she drank 1 gallon of wine
[5:01:48] <%athuramn> how did she get a whole tanker?
[5:01:49] <%Ranryu692> Paige only had one methuselah of wine
[5:01:59] <%StatesmanPrimal> well I'll be back eventually
[5:02:01] <+zacyzacy> @PatStaresAt what does the active reload get you?
[5:02:09] <%JoshManVGH> Can you believe that paige drank one entire winery?
[5:02:19] <SomeAsianDood> a faster reload @zacyzacy
[5:02:25] <%dekkitout> @Ranryu692 That's a good unit of measurement
[5:02:31] <+zacyzacy> i see cool
[5:02:32] <farrellcityking> word on the streets is paige was drunk off bathtub wine
[5:02:41] <%Mendin> Secret hole behind you on that statue's feet
[5:02:43] <+glgzephyr> @zacyzacy By default it's just faster reload, but you also get passive abilities that give you buffs for hitting it

[5:13:17] <%AzureGale> wut
[5:13:24] <+SouLucha> Uh-oh, is the subreddit gonna make some more threads about Woolie?
[5:13:26] <+zacyzacy> it seems like if you are close enough for shotgun you should use sword instead
[5:13:27] <%mikyefreash> mikyefreash subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! 
[5:13:28] <%X2Eliah> Woolie did a massive spoilerstream o
[5:13:32] <%AncelDeLambert> it'll be in Woolie's Yorha let's paly
[5:13:35] <leinadtonu> Woolie became spoiler free forever?
[5:13:43] <%Puhff> but i dont want tits
[5:13:45] <%jorniev> 70 bucks is too much still
[5:13:45] <Hydrapissed> jesus

[5:14:10] <leinadtonu> sounded like a transformer
[5:14:16] <%Agami23> speaking of giant rats making all the rules, you see rat movie reanimated?
[5:14:19] <%walternatorz> he impersonates you
[5:14:26] <JaseHateRadio> actually, maybe not
[5:14:29] <stevenellis386> is returner enough o spend 80$, Pat?
[5:14:31] <%Taisuru> psaDogchamp
[5:14:39] <Oxybe> Woolie nearly got Minh banned from ff14 by ALMOST reading leaks of content coming in 3 weeks, a big TOS no-no. Pat caught him on time and saved the day.
[5:14:45] <Admiralpoosh> yay gore
[5:14:54] <%walternatorz> pat, if you could teleport your poop, would you?
[5:15:00] <laguerrilha> Teleportation is being killed by disintegration and cloned at the other end
[5:15:02] <+OmegaFatalis> getting reconstituted is scary as fuck
[5:15:04] <therealtacopancakes> you ever gonna play lol again?
[5:15:06] <%DashXero> Pat won Anarchy Reigns.
[5:15:07] <%YakumoYomi> Most Sci-fi teleportation involves basically killing yourself, and then making a copy of you at the destination
[5:15:08] <%maenos2> i'm sure its on the wiki somewhere
[5:15:12] <%AzureGale> F
[5:15:14] <+xtkxyz> AIR RIDE? OMG
[5:15:14] <Gates623> Anarchy reigns
[5:15:16] <+glgzephyr> that makes sense
[5:15:19] <+RandyFistburgers> Wait, so youd be an immortal toilet but not teleport?
[5:15:19] <%jorniev> sad
[5:15:27] <+ALazo> I miss Liam

[5:15:50] <%TheBensonator_> I knew about Air Ride, I was hoping you might know the other two
[5:16:06] <+xtkxyz> most expensive rogue like
[5:16:09] <Rionxgarland> is pat done for the night?
[5:16:11] <%X2Eliah> @RandyFistburgers Teleport is the opposite of immortality. Teleporting = death
[5:16:23] <%Agami23> oh man, if someone hasent watched you in ages, zangief would make them lose their minds
[5:16:43] <$RealThiele> MY 5G WORKS GREAT
[5:16:47] <%Dakuu75> I miss fuggins

[5:17:10] <laguerrilha> @Dakuu75  fuggins streams now and then
[5:17:15] <+xtkxyz> I find it harder to justify $70 games tbh at least to myself
[5:17:37] <+glgzephyr> non-euclidean just means curved LUL
[5:17:48] <%AzureGale> Ewwwwww

[5:18:47] <%AzureGale> YEaaaaaah get that Killing Floor on
[5:18:56] <%Agami23> @luftraumm1 thats pretty accurate
[5:18:56] <%YakumoYomi> I like the VR one
[5:18:59] <ThirdPersonPhil> OG killing floor?
[5:19:09] <+RandyFistburgers> bye
[5:19:09] <%Taisuru> Killing Floor some good shit
[5:19:12] <+glgzephyr> @xtkxyz If $60 games are also too expensive for you, that's one thing, but a price jump of 10 dollars to account for 15 years of inflation and massively increased development costs *really* isn't that unreasonable
[5:19:14] <%TheLakinessMonster> Pasta time
[5:19:14] <Oxybe> stfu Elmo!
[5:19:16] <ThirdPersonPhil> Fuck yeah, never got into kf2 either
