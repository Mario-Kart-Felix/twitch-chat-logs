[0:02:59] <majindusto> SPAWN THO
[0:03:03] <%CJett92> Chernobyl is too depressing to binge, so I'll try Good Omens
[0:03:05] <%Gurren10101> give me those yakoosi's
[0:03:07] <%spiritofmojave> I start grinding DRK again and Pat goes live, ye
[0:03:11] <collindoucet99> Swinging around in Spider-Man while listening to the stream is great
[0:03:11] <+GrimmSquirrelGaming> @Lurantis_ i wanted to dissagree.. buti cant.
[0:03:14] <%deviljhojho94> For a minute I tought "Wait they are bringing spawn back" but then I remembered: He was in soul calibur, not MK
[0:03:15] <%Ascethetic> yo that shang tsung trailer
[0:03:19] <kulapik> pat are you not trying granblue versus?
[0:03:22] <Lurantis_> @grimmsquirrelgaming NOBODY CAN DISAGREE
[0:03:33] <collindoucet99> Folks that Batman casting is fantastic
[0:03:47] <%deviljhojho94> It might be good
[0:03:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah son
[0:03:53] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Lurantis_ I like Master Mode in BOTW, but it definitely makes even mild encounters a pain
[0:03:54] <+GrimmSquirrelGaming> @Lurantis_ its like the standard mode for me right now.
[0:03:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Look up Andrew Koji
[0:03:57] <tetraes> WOOP WOOP
[0:03:57] <%deviljhojho94> People were sceptical of Ledger too
[0:04:00] <%spiritofmojave> They're handing out Granblu keys like they're nothing lmao
[0:04:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Now thats a batman
[0:04:14] <%deviljhojho94> I refuse to touch anything gacha related with a 10 foot stick
[0:04:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Dude slays on WArrior
[0:04:14] <%Ascethetic> anyone tried the Code Veing beta yet?
[0:04:18] <xbb1024> !uptime
[0:04:18] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4m 19s.
[0:04:20] <%Ascethetic> Vein*
[0:04:36] <Lurantis_> @grimmsquirrelgaming listen man I used a full inventory of sticks against the bokoblin and decided it wasn’t for me
[0:04:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah, is it hype, or did they do a bad anime
[0:04:38] <televisedrevolting> Coming at you live from... Paradise
[0:04:48] <%spiritofmojave> Honestly gaccha shit is something I don't care to relapse on, even for an Arcsys fighter
[0:04:48] <%deviljhojho94> It is very anime
[0:04:57] <Pookiedaexzile> But is it a bad anime
[0:04:58] <%deviljhojho94> One customization option is fucking cat ears
[0:05:00] <%deviljhojho94> and cat eyes
[0:05:02] <%Ascethetic> its pretty good, combat feels rough st first till you get used to it
[0:05:08] <%ChucklesGame> Live from the GamerCube™
[0:05:11] <%THATGUY_789> Angreist Pat, Angreist Pat and Black and White Cat
[0:05:17] <collindoucet99> Raimi Suit is so great in this game
[0:05:26] <+GrimmSquirrelGaming> @Lurantis_ i get it, but after a while everything gets 2 shotted, master mode helps with endgame
[0:05:27] <Pookiedaexzile> I need to get a grip on this is it anime or ANIMEtm
[0:05:30] <HeadsHeldHigh> Watched Max play it. Just like God Eater, it has bloated "mechanics." Good thing I enjoy God Eater though
[0:05:46] <HeadsHeldHigh> It is ridiculously anime
[0:05:47] <%Ascethetic> its ANIME as fuck, but good
[0:05:47] <%deviljhojho94> You gotta see for yourself
[0:05:55] <%deviljhojho94> Some people might overdose on that much anime
[0:06:25] <+GrimmSquirrelGaming> Pat and Pagie are anime PROVE E WRONG
[0:06:28] <Pookiedaexzile> I gotta see for myself, Says the person also in a stream
[0:06:30] <televisedrevolting> HEY HEY HEY
[0:06:32] <kulapik> HERE WE GO
[0:06:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Didn't Max spend like 2 hours on the character customization? So it definitely has that going for it

[0:06:37] <$MonsterEnvy> cheer600 So Pat at the current point of the game do you have any theories on who did you think is going to be the Big villain of this game, and or rival. We have a fairly big list of potentials (Koshimizu, Someya, Han, Iwami, Kurusu, Sugai, and Lo.)

[0:33:29] <TwinBat> player unknowns yellowstone lawless zone
[0:33:31] <%PopulousNix> The only cop out there is Bear Grylls
[0:33:32] <SubjectX07x> Walks into that area and it just turns into a battle royale, the player count appears over your head.
[0:33:33] <+Mitwad> I can’t tell if Pat is being serious or joking.. and that scares me.
[0:33:34] <zanzibarian_hamster> yellowstone will kill us all eventually
[0:33:36] <%Reanimator83> Murder is bad kidz apatDab
[0:33:37] <PeregrineWanderer> but what if ive been invited there by the inheritor to my fortune?
[0:33:45] <BappoSama> When was the last Yakuza stream anyways?
[0:33:45] <%crowsloft77> It's the only way to appease the super volcano though
[0:33:48] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> ***
[0:33:49] <Hiruzen93> Maybe i wanna be murdered
[0:33:52] <%GohanEgret> SUPERVOLCANO
[0:33:56] <%ElenaManetta> WHAT
[0:33:56] <%Solidnick18> yes
[0:33:57] <%bread_assassin> Now it all hypothetical. In reality, the law will probably just find a way anyway. For those curious, it's the 50 sq mile that overlap into another state.
[0:33:57] <FstSergeant8595> yellowstone is a volcano lol
[0:33:57] <Zereaux> ITS A SUPER VOLCANO
[0:33:57] <californaya> excuse me, what

[0:34:00] <aimlesshealer> Oh, everything is going to kill us, who cares
[0:34:00] <televisedrevolting> Welp
[0:34:00] <Dementedpenguin> Cool
[0:34:01] <%ElenaManetta> But I'm safe in New York right
[0:34:03] <%JackMillerTime> maybe we could dig vent tunnels
[0:34:05] <TwinBat> it could happen whenever dude
[0:34:06] <%oddslogic> so we should litter there to kill it first
[0:34:07] <%GohanEgret> @ElenaManetta lol no
[0:34:08] <zamzoph> don't worry about it monkaS
[0:34:09] <%ElenaManetta> WHAT
[0:34:11] <hntronium> Crazy Talk better not activate on that
[0:34:13] <%spiritofmojave> I thought the estimate on when was totally unknown
[0:34:13] <%NovaKnightmare> Jackbox would be fun
[0:34:13] <+Justlaxy> Kill our crops less then people.
[0:34:15] <$SGrim> @ElenaManetta no. It's global ash winter when that shit goes.
[0:34:16] <majima666> crazy talk strikes again
[0:34:16] <+miguelrod777> IT SHOULD 'VE ERUPTED
[0:34:20] <%supersugoisenpai1> Mario Party leads to murder
[0:34:20] <%SirBigglesworthIII> cheer1000 Hey Pat. Finally caught one of your streams live. Just wanted to say thanks for introducing me to this crazy series. Your LP of Yakuza 0 was my first exposure to the series and now I'm currently playing through Kiwami 2. Keep up the good work and give Elmo pets for me.
[0:34:21] <%NovaKnightmare> that has audience participation
[0:34:23] <%GohanEgret> @spiritofmojave it's late
[0:34:24] <televisedrevolting> I didn't need that today Pat, but fuck Thanks anyway.
[0:34:24] <+VashyronM> Pressure thing = super volcano. No big deal
[0:34:24] <TabaxDM> CRAZY TALK monkaS
[0:34:25] <$Valdorick> We'll have tech to counter that malus by the time that's a problem anyway Kappa
[0:34:25] <%ChucklesGame> agitate him
[0:34:25] <pectusumbra> Crawl would be cool
[0:34:26] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Overcooked, awalays
[0:34:27] <KangarooCyborg> its a boss volcano
[0:34:29] <FrostySnowQueen> crazy talk kills billions
[0:34:29] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Cool wish I could see that vargThomas
[0:34:29] <+Mitwad> @elenamanetta unless you’re down state. Upstate is on a fault line.
[0:34:30] <%crowsloft77> oh god Crazy talks gonna proc
[0:34:33] <%castcode> don't think it monkaS
[0:34:33] <%Agami23> maybe next time clemps is on this side of the pond? @AngriestPat
[0:34:39] <marvel877> I shall stand for the opposite of killing...gnodab
[0:34:40] <%spiritofmojave> @gohanegret ah gotcha
[0:34:42] <%Conyst> We must sacrifice to the supervolcano to stop it from exploding
[0:34:45] <ShichiNoBushi> Yellowstone is apparently on top of a large magma chamber which can eventually become a super volcano.
[0:34:46] <FstSergeant8595> @KangarooCyborg its a FINAL boss volcano
[0:34:47] <+DoktahDoktah> Where did all that hair come from?
[0:34:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> I can't wait to watch Pat Yakuza the BABIES
[0:34:51] <Pookiedaexzile> The Drugs always call you back
[0:34:54] <%supersugoisenpai1> Chaotic good for life
[0:34:58] <televisedrevolting> No Lawful Neutral.
[0:34:59] <Pookiedaexzile> WHAT?
[0:35:02] <%Solidnick18> can't wait for judge eyes next month
[0:35:02] <+Shadicara> Pat is goblin good
[0:35:03] <marvel877> the greater good.
[0:35:03] <Bouldus> chaotic anything is awful always
[0:35:05] <%ThatRandomGuy661> Pat the Paladin
[0:35:07] <LokimenD> What about True Neutral?
[0:35:08] <ShichiNoBushi> Chaotic Good is when you want to oppose a tyrinical dictator.
[0:35:09] <+Mitwad> Pure Neutral.
[0:35:09] <HeadsHeldHigh> Not chaotic evil?
[0:35:10] <%tigerfang86> but now you're JAIL
[0:35:11] <Ion_Laser> the greater good
[0:35:14] <+griffball13> fuck the tau
[0:35:15] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> cheer500 Unsure if my message actually went through the way I intended. Back then my mindset was not the most stable (but then it never has been). Didn't care if I lived or died. Like, at all. So that didn't help me in the smart thoughts of "Maybe this is too far to get these sick freaks arrested" department. But hey, I've gotten psychologically better since!
[0:35:15] <%king_wragles> As usual, PAT IS WRONG
[0:35:15] <BobaFetish2124> the greater good
[0:35:16] <indig0bird> Yoshi-P found a roundabout way of saying Trans rights are human rights!
[0:35:17] <%GohanEgret> @spiritofmojave at least I think it was, I might be thinking of the huge earthquake in california that's coming one day, I get my Nova episodes mixed up
[0:35:19] <%ElenaManetta> What's the point of the greater good if I don't get to enjoy it
[0:35:20] <televisedrevolting> Lawful Neutal is the only truly free alignment
[0:35:20] <Bouldus> so is neutral anything tbf
[0:35:21] <zanzibarian_hamster> l\wfuk
[0:35:22] <$Valdorick> I'd rather have Chaotic good than fucking Chaotic Neutral.
[0:35:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> CG clerics for life baby!
[0:35:22] <Pookiedaexzile> FUck you Chaotic Good fo lyfe, I steal bread for the children
[0:35:26] <%JackMillerTime> well fuck being lawful
[0:35:26] <$SGrim> @ShichiNoBushi Yellowstone already is a super volcano. It's just presently dormant.
[0:35:30] <Fien111> CG is fine for the thief, but you gotta watch his ass regardless so that's not the real issue. It's that he's the THIEF
[0:35:33] <HeadsHeldHigh> Chaotic evil is the worst to play with
[0:35:37] <Bouldus> basically if you arent good something you will make life shit for the group
[0:35:41] <zanzibarian_hamster> lawful stupid is the worst
[0:35:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Chaotic good is the alignment of the comrade
[0:35:47] <+DoktahDoktah> Chaotic Neutral is just a PC way of saying Chaotic Gives No Fucks About Everything.
[0:35:50] <+Mitwad> keewhammy 2.
[0:36:00] <televisedrevolting> @headsheldhigh Not unless you're playing a supervillain.
[0:36:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> Look, guys, just cuz Anders is a fuck bitch doesn't mean Chaotic Good is sucky. it just depends on the kind of chaos
[0:36:08] <%ElenaManetta> There are no secrets allowed on this stream
[0:36:10] <%tigerfang86> 👏 go you
[0:36:10] <Zereaux> Xd
[0:36:11] <%ECRead> isn't chaotic good the entire premise of P5?
[0:36:13] <%ElenaManetta> We share everything
[0:36:13] <$MonsterEnvy> CN in some ways is bad. As they play Chaotic Evil while trying to say they are not
[0:36:14] <$Valdorick> Know the best part about Chaotic Good party members? THEY DON'T GIVE A SHIT - Baby orcs all die just the same! Stupid uppity Paladins.
[0:36:17] <%king_wragles> What Pat described was CHAOTIC STUPID. A decent player would consider the consequences to the party unless extremes are agreed on by EVERYONE
[0:36:21] <aimlesshealer> I hate other people too much to play D&D with them, it's a lonely existence
[0:36:24] <$cureneckbeard> Chaotic Neutral is just Chaotic Evil
[0:36:32] <%tigerfang86> Like HEAT

[0:46:55] <HeadsHeldHigh> Does this guy fucking blink
[0:46:56] <%ChucklesGame> i havent seen a single person blink since this cutscene started
[0:46:57] <%tigerfang86> hmmmm

[0:47:03] <%ElenaManetta> I love gang fights
[0:47:04] <indig0bird> Has balls
[0:47:04] <moonmeh> there's a cool charisma to someya
[0:47:08] <%supersugoisenpai1> This asshole is growing on me
[0:47:08] <%ElenaManetta> The community really benefits from territory disputes
[0:47:08] <$Valdorick> That feeling when - you accidently a race war.
[0:47:09] <%Harawanagangsta> !commands
[0:47:09] <@Moobot> Use these to snitch on your friends !snitch, !sellout, !countdown, !uptime, !recipe
[0:47:10] <%theAncopro> he has been fairly straight with us so far
[0:47:10] <%Solidnick18> i feel that
[0:47:13] <TomAtlus> !uptime
[0:47:14] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 47m 15s.
[0:47:18] <+zanzibar_junker> He's better than Nishiki
[0:47:19] <FstSergeant8595> @ChucklesGame I was literally just thinking about that
[0:47:19] <Dest_121> someya is a strange character
[0:47:19] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> He's a real criminal. Just feel the backstabbing.
[0:47:22] <TomAtlus> !countdown
[0:47:23] <%Solidnick18> someya is a great character
[0:47:23] <%Longerbone_ghm> I also like Someya, he's no Kuze tho.
[0:47:24] <indig0bird> And apparently split amicably with his wief
[0:47:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Nagumo NTRd yet again
[0:47:24] <$Plutt_bug> In Japan you are only allowed 40,000 blinks a year
[0:47:25] <Elofhousewood> Blinking is a sign of weakness
[0:47:26] <indig0bird> wife*
[0:47:31] <RupanSen> that's not a high bar
[0:47:34] <%theAncopro> virgin nagumo vs chad someya
[0:47:35] <%radda343> Leave Nagumo alone, he's trying his best
[0:47:35] <Admiral_PopnFresh> He's a less petty Nishiki
[0:47:36] <%tigerfang86> he'd just MURDER HIM YEAH
[0:47:37] <moonmeh> nagumo is the stupid jojo friend
[0:47:38] <%korth367> background robot
[0:47:38] <TheNocturnalScotsman> he's great, his actors is a chill guy too
[0:47:39] <%king_wragles> @ChucklesGame Everyone except for Nagumo is just super focused. Nagumo probably forgot he can blink.
[0:47:40] <Dest_121> nagumo is an idiot that means well though
[0:47:42] <%windsoc> shut up okuyasu
[0:47:43] <HeadsHeldHigh> Robot women scanning for targets
[0:47:45] <%spiritofmojave> Someya least respects Kiryu
[0:47:45] <indig0bird> Nagamo is aggresively stupid
[0:47:46] <%PopulousNix> Her head!
[0:47:50] <%tigerfang86> Like a Vegeta
[0:47:51] <$Plutt_bug> Naguma isn't even a lovable idiot. He's just an idiot
[0:47:51] <%Longerbone_ghm> like people like Kuze from 0 right?
[0:47:52] <CrowbarFacelift> Nagumo is to be treasured
[0:47:52] <%bread_assassin> What Nagumo lacks in brains, he makes up for in heart @AngriestPat
[0:47:56] <indig0bird> I feel offended by his sheer idiocy

[1:08:10] <InugamiTheHound> he was the leader and he wants Kiryu to kill the other gangs and he takes over
[1:08:10] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It was a long con. Yellow jacket set it up so that he could run the gang. He used Kiryu.

[1:08:37] <$Plutt_bug> dibs must be honored
[1:08:46] <Ion_Laser> sbeefDead
[1:08:47] <Elofhousewood> Petty crime is the best crime
[1:08:50] <DomunDomunDomun> That's 100% how organised crime works.
[1:08:51] <%ryome> I am the BIG crime now!
[1:08:53] <$Wafflum> I'm pretty sure calling dibs on crime is all about what turf wars are about.
[1:08:59] <$Plutt_bug> victimless crimes

[1:43:04] <%spiritofmojave> Kiryu HATES killing
[1:43:15] <%PopulousNix> No you pinstripe wearing fuck
[1:43:15] <hassanico> I mean Someya's plan makes sense
[1:43:18] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hes sick of this shit
[1:43:20] <President_valentine> Lo is fucking great
[1:43:21] <%mayorrev> he has a vest
[1:43:29] <切捨御免> that doesn't mean what you think it means
[1:43:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> NANI
[1:43:30] <ミュウレ4242> standard bad motherfucker reaction.
[1:43:30] <Dakuu75> "non-plus'd" wtf is that
[1:43:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> cool
[1:43:37] <theobble> n a n i
[1:43:38] <%Solidnick18> kiryu
[1:43:40] <JittersCaffeine> "Man, I REALLY hope this Kiryu guy stops that guy with the gun"
[1:43:41] <President_valentine> You don't become the leader of a huge gang by being a pussy
[1:43:42] <stuffstuffwhatever> I'm glad he went "hm" instead of "nani"
[1:43:46] <hassanico> oh right
[1:43:49] <@lewdskeletor13> @dakuu75 Nonplussed. It means not bothered
[1:43:51] <+bear_breaker20> time to catch the bullet
[1:43:53] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Daigo sucks as a boss, Kiryu
[1:44:04] <hassanico> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli Kiryu likes him still
[1:44:06] <moonmeh> what good did Daigo do anyway
[1:44:08] <tyrianpurplehaze> So it's Kiryu's fault the Tojo suck so bad.
[1:44:09] <majindusto> How Dare you put MY SON in jail
[1:44:12] <kayoshibe> I really wish the animations weren't so stiff in cutscenes, it's probably the game's biggest downside compared to the rest of the series.
[1:44:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> SHOOT
[1:44:17] <alexandrecau> Kind of a dick move in hindsight- kiryu
[1:44:19] <%dheng1> daigo was useless
[1:44:20] <hassanico> Kiryu likes Daigo as a friend not as a mob boss
[1:44:26] <Dakuu75> thank you <3 my slang-library expands
[1:44:28] <takiyami> Kiryu likes Daigo as chariman because it means that Kiryu himself doesn't have to take any responsiblity
[1:44:29] <tyrianpurplehaze> You keep saying you're not Yakuza anymore, Kiryu! Stop going back and forth!
[1:44:31] <alexandrecau> except when you say you're not yakuza
[1:44:33] <$Plutt_bug> 1. you're a jerk. 2. you're really a jerk
[1:44:33] <%mayorrev> FIGHT
[1:44:40] <Naho_Saenoki> Weirdly enough, nonplussed means the opposite everywhere EXCEPT North America.
[1:44:41] <%bread_assassin> Daigo had it coming those times, though.
[1:44:43] <+griffball13> it is
[1:44:43] <+critfumble_> wow kiryu called someone else naive, when he doesnt even know what sex is
[1:44:43] <a_mad_dragon> @AngriestPat nonplussed means confused or baffled
[1:44:45] <redial_nick> you left him on that lot
[1:44:48] <+Shadicara> Forever Yakuzie
[1:44:48] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Minimal planning iis an understatement
[1:44:49] <@lewdskeletor13> But Daigo needed it tho
[1:44:49] <alexandrecau> what a backhanded compliment
[1:44:50] <big_chugnus> "I'm gonna be real with you guys, Daigo and Kiryu are no longer friends"
[1:44:56] <stuffstuffwhatever> kiryu is a non-yakuza who totally gets super involved with yakuza every game
[1:44:56] <%mayorrev> that IS a nice tie tho
[1:44:59] <notToph> kayoshibe the actual cutscenes (like this one) are great, it's the in-engine ones that look eh because they have no idle animations
[1:45:03] <redial_nick> i did
[1:45:04] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Kappa
[1:45:05] <%mayorrev> ayy
[1:45:07] <Psyramics> its one of those words that means both things
[1:45:10] <CopperTucker> you dumbass, he's gonna fight both of you
[1:45:10] <Naho_Saenoki> @a_mad_dragon Apparently, Pat's definition was added to dictionaries fairly recently.
[1:45:12] <grayjammer> Nonplussed means BOTH
[1:45:19] <%mayorrev> it does?
[1:45:26] <%spiritofmojave> shutup...
[1:45:27] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Lol no
[1:45:27] <tyrianpurplehaze> It's one of those things so many people got wrong that they added the wrong one to the dictionary.
[1:45:31] <moonmeh> Lo got the popcorn
[1:45:32] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@sonofthedeepsouth) (warning)
[1:45:32] <+griffball13> we are not so different
[1:45:33] <haitakaa> nonplussed means so confused that you don't know how to react
[1:45:34] <Ion_Laser> cmonBruh

[1:45:47] <RiverBirch> How about you kill them both Kiryu
[1:45:47] <%enickma11> The north American connotation of nonplussed means unbothered. Pat is not wrong

[1:57:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> BIG LVLS
[1:57:56] <Ominnous> tiger driver
[1:57:56] <hassanico> NERFED TIGER DROP
[1:57:58] <+ahegotrigger> YEAH
[1:57:59] <+Grayhammatter> we must drop the tigers
[1:58:03] <%kiiiirsten> @GarbageQueenEllie If we're orphans we get in free
[1:58:03] <+ahegotrigger> Best move in the game
[1:58:06] <stuffstuffwhatever> It's not super nerfed
[1:58:07] <President_valentine> More like kitten drop
[1:58:07] <okiesensation> the golden child
[1:58:08] <ShichiNoBushi> And you didn't have to play Pocket Racer.
[1:58:12] <stuffstuffwhatever> Still powerful
[1:58:21] <mr_ESB> Tiger drop is still great lol
[1:58:23] <+ahegotrigger> even nerfed its still really fucking strong
[1:58:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> @kiiiirsten I like the way you think. Time to form a murder pact
[1:58:25] <Dr_Mooose> ugs
[1:58:37] <InugamiTheHound> pocket circuit fighter FTW!!
[1:58:37] <+thefakeh> man, kiryu really is just a japanese archer isnt he
[1:58:43] <hassanico> KILLED
[1:58:43] <stuffstuffwhatever> It'sjust that enemies tend to attack closer to you then in previous games and it does a bit less damage relative as well
[1:58:46] <%spiritofmojave> they just nerfed it to be great, just not game breaking
[1:58:48] <Ion_Laser> sbeefDead
[1:58:49] <+mik255> wow they nerfed tiger drop
[1:58:50] <%doughvatkyn> my crestaaaa
[1:58:52] <%hussdogrob> from the makers of lemon drop its new tiger drop!
[1:59:04] <indig0bird> Kiryu lowkey frontal kicked a guy and knockbacked him 2 metres
[1:59:11] <stuffstuffwhatever> Like, enemies won't attack when they're out of range to hit you anymore as much
[1:59:12] <mr_ESB> Tiger drop upgrade makes it silly easy to do
[1:59:12] <%Typhaeon> Tiger Drop sounds like a backdrop tiger suplex
[1:59:26] <+ZerauxO> trashcan to the balls POG
[1:59:27] <stuffstuffwhatever> So it's harder to just bait them and wait and react
[1:59:36] <big_chugnus> Pat buy some CP

[2:03:08] <hassanico> define camera creep @bear_breaker20

[2:06:17] <+cvp5127> did you wipe
[2:06:22] <%brickwall35> speed poop
[2:06:23] <majindusto> THANKS...I HATE IT
[2:06:27] <thejolliestsunbro> peeing is pretty sinful tbh i'm surprised you still choose to have your bladder
[2:06:43] <%gliph13> that was too short for a poo
[2:06:44] <+burritocheetos> D:
[2:06:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> We always assume you poop
[2:06:53] <shotgang86> WutFace WutFace
[2:06:54] <allanmiri> You said you had to take a massive dummp
[2:06:56] <alwayspronking> Kiryu never poops, confirmed!
[2:06:57] <%PopulousNix> I pooped just earlier this day
[2:06:58] <%ThatRandomGuy661> Because you directly mentioned doing it
[2:06:59] <+mik255> DIO
[2:07:01] <%supersugoisenpai1> Poop is the devil being expelled out of your body
[2:07:02] <+bear_breaker20> sooner or later buddy*
[2:07:02] <+burritocheetos> Dio?
[2:07:04] <tank7013> Pat you said you were going to poop
[2:07:04] <@lewdskeletor13> Nobody poops. Only nerds do
[2:07:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> "You are an wicked child and that is concentrated evil coming out of you"
[2:07:12] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> use it in the bathroom

[2:07:31] <+mik255> BUT IT WAS I DIO
[2:07:35] <VritraReiRei> @lewdskeletor13 that's DEFINITELY what happened. Now the question is whether Haruka was trying to protect him because he's just a baby or some Yakuza heir or smth
[2:07:41] <oAznoUta> funny you said not to go run anywhere, as I am literally getting ready to go running right now
[2:07:43] <%PalmtopNami> woah low viewers on this one qtf

[2:10:51] <%D33TR> anemos -> pagos -> pyros -> hydatos

[2:26:45] <%Kirby_Sauce> @MasterDecoder yeah but this time I'm up late, sick, running on 3 hours sleep and tired from a double shift at work.
[2:27:08] <%MasterDecoder> OH damn, hope that all clears up Kirbs
[2:27:23] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Why do I have the feeling the old man is just keeping Haruto safe by going on the run away from the other Yakuzas that wants the baby
[2:27:30] <PortableBoredom> See, this is why you always don't pay for your drinks if the bartender's out of the room
[2:27:33] <hassanico> "Chugoku Mafia"?
[2:27:35] <@lewdskeletor13> I like Yuta, he’s the best of the idiot gang
[2:27:42] <$Plutt_bug> How is that a clue?
[2:27:43] <hassanico> How does that translate into Saio triad?
[2:27:52] <%Typhaeon> Kiryu always says "Chinese mafia", yet they translate it as "x triad"
[2:27:52] <$Plutt_bug> That's like an anti-clue
[2:27:56] <televisedrevolting> @lewdskeletor13 Yeah, he's pretty rad.
[2:27:58] <%Kirby_Sauce> @MasterDecoder the weirdest part is I'm super chipper, if not outright catty.
[2:28:01] <%spiritofmojave> Yuta could actually be a bright kid outside this Yakuzies business
[2:28:01] <%tigerfang86> or maybe he's EVIL
[2:28:02] <%Typhaeon> It makes more sense for him to not draw distinctions
[2:28:10] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I trust him more than her tbh
[2:28:14] <$Plutt_bug> good Elmo

[2:28:58] <+bear_breaker20> sure she can blame herself
[2:29:08] <%shiplord13> She let an old man steal a baby.
[2:29:16] <%dheng1> you had one job
[2:29:27] <@lewdskeletor13> He’s a dick
[2:29:37] <televisedrevolting> Harsh, but fair.
[2:29:39] <@lewdskeletor13> He doesn’t even have cool tattoos
[2:29:45] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat Kiryu you beat the crap out of the sixth chairman and made him toughen up.
[2:29:46] <%MagickBurritoh> geez

[2:33:50] <%ThatGuyfromMars> "hey I murdered a guy for you, now kiss me"
[2:33:51] <hassanico> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli well obviously it was a bad decision and they messed up

[2:34:06] <stabbityrabbit> So, what are the chances that he manipulated the whole thing to happen?
[2:34:08] <@lewdskeletor13> Did they give a year for that flashback?
[2:34:08] <indig0bird> He's her "knight"
[2:34:10] <%dheng1> now it makes sense why she wears purple
[2:34:16] <%spiritofmojave> forcing women to kiss him, what a big hero
[2:34:18] <Ion_Laser> @lewdskeletor13 nope
[2:34:20] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I wonder why she cut her hair short
[2:34:21] <indig0bird> Basically, yeah
[2:34:22] <hassanico> She couldn't handle the Yakuza life
[2:34:23] <+griffball13> ABUSE
[2:34:24] <mr_ESB> Look at nagumo
[2:34:26] <%PanicSwytch> Im gonna show up all bloody and sweaty and kiss a girl
[2:34:26] <BigCoffee> @dheng1 What's up with purple

[2:34:35] <%dheng1> someya motif
[2:34:36] <a_baby_worm> It’s not just japan lmao wtf
[2:34:38] <%AncelDeLambert> same girl, different face, same Kiryu
[2:34:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> So this is what Majimas life with Makoto would have ended up
[2:34:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> Great choice, lady! A real keeper
[2:34:49] <hassanico> Don't marry on impulse people!
[2:34:51] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Majima is too married to the job
[2:35:13] <%mayorrev> she took the fucking kids
[2:35:15] <President_valentine> wait for it
[2:35:17] <hassanico> she just said she did
[2:35:20] <%spiritofmojave> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli least Majima isn't an outright shitlord to women
[2:35:20] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat just listen
[2:35:23] <BobaFetish2124> I never understood Japan's mentality of "force the girl, she'll like it eventually"
[2:35:23] <hassanico> but they caught her
[2:35:26] <moonmeh> SHE JUST SAID SHE DID
[2:35:27] <%castcode> she could not Karen

[2:36:11] <BobaFetish2124> @bigcoffee true
[2:36:16] <%AncelDeLambert> Kiryu, try to keep this one alive this time, okay?
[2:36:21] <a_baby_worm> @fatman2124 This happens in so many American movies too, it’s sexism
[2:36:21] <hassanico> I don't think she deserves any flack for this but that was still kinda selfish
[2:36:24] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> @spiritofmojave oh idk i havent played Majima in Kiwami 2, but I do know his love life with the Korean girl in 5 didnt work out so good
[2:36:25] <+Darren716> I want the daughter to somehow be past Haruka that fell through time
[2:36:26] <%AncelDeLambert> lady, you did fine
[2:36:31] <indig0bird> I mean
[2:36:35] <$rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat Fairly?
[2:36:37] <hassanico> Yeah pretty grey area
[2:36:37] <colzack_> It's a real tough situation for her
[2:36:37] <indig0bird> I'm on her side
[2:36:39] <%AncelDeLambert> you caught the eye of a psycho and were young, we understand
[2:36:40] <%nofestu2> super complex
[2:36:45] <%AncelDeLambert> SHUT UP, asshole!
[2:36:45] <President_valentine> Nagumo matures
[2:36:47] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Still a cuck (jk)
[2:36:48] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Nagumoment
[2:36:51] <SeventyForce> Stay and get beat down or run and leave baabee
[2:36:52] <%spiritofmojave> @gyro_gogo_zeppeli oh yeah, that was a bit toxic! true true
[2:36:57] <@lewdskeletor13> NAGUMO SHUT UP
[2:36:58] <indig0bird> Wait, it's not about that?
[2:36:59] <maskeddudej> big balls nagumo
[2:37:00] <hassanico> It's not the running that's wrong, but leaving the kid is a bit fucked up
[2:37:01] <%AncelDeLambert> Nagumo's trying to be deep, oh no
[2:37:09] <%dheng1> big dick nagumo
[2:37:10] <%spiritofmojave> just beat them all off, Nagumo
[2:37:11] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Okuyasu moment
[2:37:15] <%PanicSwytch> KIDNAP MORE BABIEs
[2:37:16] <mr_ESB> Nagumo stahp
[2:37:17] <%machshop> machshop subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! violence is the way
[2:37:21] <%Ner234> You can't just fix all your problems by beating everyone up Pat.
[2:37:23] <%AncelDeLambert> she DIDN"t
[2:37:23] <stabbityrabbit> Please don't do another forced kiss. Two so close together would be too much.
[2:37:24] <@lewdskeletor13> Ok actually don’t shut up
[2:37:28] <Onamar> She can't fight the fucking YAKUZA on her own
[2:37:32] <+starzo0> well how was she going to get the kid?
[2:37:32] <Zombrocom> What else could she do though?
[2:37:32] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Time to beat up Someya and kidnap another child
[2:37:33] <breakerdsx> Get beaten by your Yakuza ex-husband+not getting your daughter back vs surviving+not getting your daughter back; tough decision here
[2:37:34] <HeadsHeldHigh> Become a true mama
[2:37:34] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Pat shes not Kiryu
[2:37:35] <RiverBirch> What if she actually pulled a Kiryu
[2:37:37] <Dr_Mooose> She would die if she kept prying
[2:37:37] <Zombrocom> She aint kiryu
[2:37:37] <%dheng1> kiryu was touched
[2:37:37] <Elofhousewood> That’s it nagumo scream some sense into the abuse victim
[2:37:38] <corneredcorvid> Pat he's YAKUZA she's a RANDOM CIVILIAN
[2:37:39] <President_valentine> Kind of hard to keep a kid when your getting beat
[2:37:40] <RiverBirch> And she kidnapped the baby
[2:37:42] <Tucker0603> Nagumo might be a dumbass, but he means well
[2:37:42] <+bear_breaker20> Shes a coward so what no the biggest sin
[2:37:42] <hassanico> She's not gonna kiss Naguma y'all
[2:37:43] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Ner234 I dunno, it's worked well for Kiryu so far
[2:37:44] <indig0bird> I mean, leaving the kid because a murderous bastard is after you is understandable
[2:37:44] <%shiplord13> Yeah, you not only ditched the kid but said well shit no point in trying to get her back
[2:37:45] <Dest_121> lets kidnap another child
[2:37:45] <$Plutt_bug> She literally had no choice
[2:37:46] <%AncelDeLambert> remember, Pat, Kiryu is BAD at being a yakuza
[2:37:47] <+stupid_neko21> ok...but doesn't taht happen a lot actually when ppl leave abusers?
[2:37:47] <+burritocheetos> LUL
[2:37:51] <+Grayhammatter> she's not though
[2:37:52] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I still can't get over how much I hate his shirt.

[2:49:31] <@lewdskeletor13> Does the Yomei Alliance even pose a threat? They’re like in third place behind the Omi right?
[2:49:38] <%AncelDeLambert> the second I see Kiryu pick up a moped like it's a bag of rice, I'm running
[2:49:42] <%PopulousNix> Hell it's even that same guy in the ugly purple jacket
[2:49:42] <%Ner234> They know who he is and they are still trying to fight him LUL .
[2:49:44] <+bear_breaker20> The secret is that Kiryu has development amnesia due to old age
[2:49:47] <%Reizie_Etherealm> >Sick Japanese butt rock starts playing intensely
[2:49:52] <%machshop> by this point, kiryu should have beaten up about 25% of japan
[2:49:52] <ameraaaaaa> maybe all 0unks are suicidal
[2:49:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> Yakuza Goons are masochists

[2:56:11] <McAngrimStein> 'bout to be a really red buddy
[2:56:12] <%dheng1> mad dog
[2:56:12] <critikal_bit> Discount Majima
[2:56:15] <CrowbarFacelift> Hey wait, he has two eyes. That's not fair.
[2:56:15] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no. A knife. Kiryu is so intimidated.
[2:56:16] <ShichiNoBushi> Let me show you my brown trousers next time.
[2:56:18] <King_Wolf_Rigger> The red is to cover up all the blood he'll be bleeding
[2:56:20] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> This guy wants to be Majima. I knew the real Majima. You sir, are no Majima.
[2:56:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> Drop a bomb on that guy's ass
[2:56:22] <Dr_Mooose> don't you disrespect Majima like that
[2:56:22] <$rdark_ksu> Those types of knives make me nervous, Have a crossguard for fucks sake
[2:56:24] <alexandrecau> a;; about nuke
[2:56:25] <%Hitman0257> Why can he use a knife if he has two eyes
[2:56:26] <hassanico> guys this guy isn't pretnding to be crazy like Majima
[2:56:29] <%dheng1> great value majima
[2:56:29] <Ominnous> psssssh
[2:56:30] <+Jordevio> Are you streaming Judgement when it comes out or are you gonna stream Kiwami 2 first?
[2:56:32] <Ominnous> you're no Majima
[2:56:32] <theobble> kiwami means Japanese sword
[2:56:34] <%demegodz> O
[2:56:35] <hassanico> He's just a hardass
[2:56:36] <%demegodz> Okay?
[2:56:37] <DatAsuna> this is one of the best scenes in the game
[2:56:43] <RiverBirch> kiwami means plan
[2:56:44] <alexandrecau> yes he is openly bonkers
[2:56:47] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat you have grey pants and black hair, he has a black shirt and grey(ish) hair. Your destinies are combined through color palette
[2:56:49] <%demegodz> I dont want your wood
[2:56:50] <+starzo0> nah, hes pssst majima
[2:56:53] <prime_name> What is this super villian?
[2:56:57] <President_valentine> Way tougher than him
[2:57:02] <+starzo0> great value is too good for him
[2:57:03] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Kiryu fought the MAD DOG Majima and he's fine
[2:57:04] <%spiritofmojave> Unless this bloke has Breaker he ain't shit
[2:57:06] <PortableBoredom> He's strong enough to be an alternate protagonist, I hear.
[2:57:09] <$MonsterEnvy> This guy is the Captain of the Yomei
[2:57:13] <mr_ESB> Level is pretty cool
[2:57:19] <+bear_breaker20> this is the one guy who looks actually intimidating
[2:57:20] <%tigerfang86> imagine thinking you can be majima when kiryu knows majima
[2:57:20] <%mayorrev> imagine if a car came and ran him over
[2:57:27] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Breaker style is more OP than MAD DOG style confirmed
[2:57:36] <$rdark_ksu> fighting in a suit jacket must absolutely fucking suck ass
[2:57:39] <hassanico> ok that stance though is Majima as fuck
[2:57:43] <President_valentine> breaker is super OP
[2:57:50] <%king_wragles> Oh wait, is this guy fighting Kiryu with a knife? Did no one tell him that's super dangerous?
[2:57:52] <@lewdskeletor13> I want Majima back!
[2:57:59] <%mayorrev> thats the longest subtitle
[2:58:00] <%gliph13> you gotta respect the guys who know about kiryu and still want to fight him out of enjoyment and thrill.
[2:58:02] <+bear_breaker20> @rdark_ksu Gives you a reason to buy a new one, win win
[2:58:04] <hassanico> Majima's in super jail...
[2:58:04] <%king_wragles> His odds of survival are MUCH greater if he doesn't have a weapon
[2:58:13] <%tigerfang86> SYMBOLISM
[2:58:13] <ShichiNoBushi> Torii?
[2:58:18] <+Deano8817> maybe?
[2:58:19] <hassanico> cool
[2:58:22] <HeadsHeldHigh> what is this dark souls lore
[2:58:22] <indig0bird> It's intentional
[2:58:24] <+Deano8817> lets go with maybe
[2:58:27] <Zombrocom> Prob overthinking it
[2:58:27] <%Reizie_Etherealm> SYMBOLlSM DOOD
[2:58:30] <%spiritofmojave> hey that'd be cool
[2:58:30] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Seems intentional
[2:58:31] <%dheng1> damn pat with the insight
[2:58:32] <InugamiTheHound> knocking on heaven's door
[2:58:35] <%gliph13> dude this series is all about that shit
[2:58:36] <%AncelDeLambert> all of a sudden we hear "KIRYU CHAAAAAN!" and Majima rockets down out of the sky, headbutting this guy unconcious
[2:58:36] <hassanico> HE WON"T SLOW ME DOWN
[2:58:40] <+Grayhammatter> holy shit, he went flying
[2:58:41] <SeventyForce> Guy's no majima.....
[2:58:42] <+Deano8817> pat what the fuck is this insight who are you
[2:58:44] <+bear_breaker20> unspoken symbolism is the best symbolism
[2:58:46] <hassanico> I love Kiryu's thoughts
[2:58:47] <%Nobrev> what is this metal gear music
[2:58:50] <%Niney_Who> But not Majima tough
[2:58:54] <mr_ESB> Fighter in back
[2:58:59] <%spiritofmojave> @anceldelambert Man if only...
[2:59:02] <RiverBirch> Only Majima can satisfy me
[2:59:04] <%Reizie_Etherealm> He's got a very deep shade of red for his suit, I like it
[2:59:05] <alexandrecau> dragon doesn't understand symbolism
[2:59:05] <stuffstuffwhatever> it's the generic boss music. I like it more then most people do
[2:59:06] <%gliph13> remember the weapon triangle pat.
[2:59:07] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Very evil
[2:59:14] <stuffstuffwhatever> It fits the dark atmosphere
[2:59:27] <stuffstuffwhatever> do your knife disarm heat move pat
[2:59:31] <redial_nick> i guess instead of multiples life bard is just a really thick one
[2:59:32] <%gliph13> gun < fist < knife
[2:59:57] <$Plutt_bug> This music is hot
[2:59:59] <%Reizie_Etherealm> "Fuck this"
[3:00:06] <hassanico> his face fucking stretched
[3:00:11] <hassanico> what was that hand maneuver????
[3:00:14] <mr_ESB> Knife counter you have to let go of lock on
[3:00:18] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> he blocked his eyesight lol
[3:00:20] <+HellCopter> the facemask
[3:00:20] <Zombrocom> He tried to blind kiryu
[3:00:35] <hassanico> At least this ain't Kiwami 1
[3:00:35] <Dr_Mooose> well knifes hurt so
[3:00:36] <%gliph13> better then fucking gun characters
[3:00:36] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> no healing run
[3:00:39] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Well, to be fair, it does suck to get stabbed.
[3:00:41] <hassanico> Remember the Kiwami stuns?
[3:00:48] <hassanico> Cause you had no antistun gear
[3:00:49] <%gliph13> remember yakuza 1/kiwami
[3:00:50] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> He's got a big number, but he's no Majima
[3:00:51] <%spiritofmojave> open wounds have that tendency
[3:00:54] <theobble> I hate it when people try to stab me off balance
[3:00:54] <prime_name> Why is Pat fighting his character from Vampire?
[3:00:56] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That guy in the Taxi just chilling LUL
[3:00:58] <VanLynx> is that why pat hates being stabbed?
[3:00:59] <stuffstuffwhatever> the kiwami stun could be stopped with gear
[3:01:00] <hassanico> Nice finish!
[3:01:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> HE BOUNCED

[3:06:17] <SeventyForce> Much, More, DUMB
[3:06:17] <+bear_breaker20> Shocker your daughter put out for the hot one
[3:06:18] <%bread_assassin> That was my reasoning, too. There's no way Haruka wouldn't want that D.

[3:34:55] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Rosetta Stone
[3:34:56] <Mr_Strut> The dad is not actually a secret chinese. He's actually a secret korean.
[3:34:57] <Elofhousewood> Correct
[3:34:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's dramatic irony, Pat
[3:35:00] <$Plutt_bug> fuck
[3:35:00] <$rdark_ksu> Thats fur the audience
[3:35:00] <+burritocheetos> Kiryu reads the subtitle
[3:35:02] <RupanSen> Araki forgot
[3:35:06] <+Flambage> Kiyru knows in his heart how to speak all languages
[3:35:09] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat He knows now Yuta doesn't have the kid so...
[3:35:10] <alexandrecau> @squirtkitten just to bargain with the chinese
[3:35:11] <%PopulousNix> Kiryu needs to fucking learn korean then
[3:35:12] <+stevenlambchops> All according to keikaku
[3:35:12] <+bear_breaker20> He spole TO Kiryu so japanese is implied i guess
[3:35:14] <reonome> 🤔
[3:35:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> Maybe Haruto is secret Korean.
[3:35:18] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> @Mr_Strut That's so stupid that it probably is true.
[3:35:28] <Psyramics> they assume the chase is still underway?
[3:35:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> No the Grunt spoke to Vergil.
[3:35:31] <squirtkitten> @alexandrecau Holy shit this kid is truly in the middle of it
[3:35:32] <TheLakinessMonster> They intercepted the baby offscreen
[3:35:32] <hassanico> Also the Koreans aren't straight up KILLING the baby so what's their plan???
[3:35:36] <hassanico> Blackmail?
[3:35:37] <breakerdsx> Haruto is a biracial angel!
[3:35:37] <reonome> nagumo probably fucked up
[3:35:39] <%Zaramoth> The baby hired the Koreans to take him

[3:39:43] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yuta confirmed to hate biracials
[3:39:43] <hassanico> @AncelDeLambert I think it's the mafia reason
[3:39:44] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat Yuta has learned that if he doesn't save his son, Kiryu will kill him.
[3:39:44] <%Zaramoth> Show him how to be the boss of this gym

[3:39:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> Kiryu is so angry right now that his heat aura has taken over the ENTIRE CITY
[3:39:54] <%enickma11> Kiryu says racism is NO GOOD
[3:39:55] <Snarksmith> "Why won't you help a baby? Because you're Chinese?"
[3:39:57] <%Reizie_Etherealm> THE RACE WAR ENDS NOW
[3:39:58] <reonome> KIRYU SOLVES RACISM
[3:39:59] <Ion_Laser> Real serious
[3:39:59] <Dest_121> straight up they said they didn't want a mixed race baby as the heir
[3:39:59] <SpaceGuntank> Tri-Dad!!
[3:40:00] <%kiiiirsten> The real race war is the journey of fatherhood
[3:40:00] <+bear_breaker20> Not The ONLY Reason but Yes

[3:40:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> @AncelDeLambert You underestimate how much Japanese people hate Chinese.
[3:40:13] <RupanSen> it's more nationalism than racism tho

[3:40:14] <Maids4lyfe> monkaS
[3:40:15] <%kiiiirsten> BANISHED

[3:40:33] <alexandrecau> like all asian gangs are going to kill a baby
[3:40:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah but Kiryu doesnt give any fucks
[3:40:35] <InugamiTheHound> Japanese hate the Koreans they want Korea back under their control
[3:40:37] <+bear_breaker20> you have to be really stupid to think its the only reason tho
[3:40:37] <hassanico> @indig0bird you forget this is all instigated by a Japanese mob right
[3:40:37] <%stooooo22> maybe the real race war was the friends we made along the way
[3:40:38] <LokimenD> Woolie would love this game
[3:40:38] <$rdark_ksu> So Yuta's only dislike of the triad is cause racism? they didnt like fuck him up or w/e?
[3:40:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> Asian people are super racist to other Asian people

[3:41:09] <+Grayson_XLS> MISGIVINGS
[3:41:09] <Mr_Strut> They aren't very friendly towards each other
[3:41:09] <%gliph13> SLIGHT misgivings
[3:41:09] <Bogart4321> up till now
[3:41:10] <Dr_Mooose> you would be correct
[3:41:11] <reonome> MAYBE
[3:41:11] <Snarksmith> Listen Nagumo might be an incel and an idiot but at least WHILE he sulked and whined he still showed the fuck up for the baby
[3:41:12] <+cvp5127> a few
[3:41:12] <%SilvaChariot0133> THat's a possibility
[3:41:13] <Hairy_butts> Kappa oh yeah?
[3:41:13] <TabaxDM> O O F
[3:41:13] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> They hate each other very much. For about 10,000 years.
[3:41:14] <Dest_121> most of the asian countries don't get along
[3:41:14] <reonome> JUST MAYBE

[3:41:15] <+AXL808> Now for Kiryu to play some fucking boxcar races with children
[3:41:15] <%dheng1> japanese and china do not like either bad blood in the past
[3:41:16] <+ArcLifth> MAYBE
[3:41:17] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Mistakes were made
[3:41:17] <%AncelDeLambert> a few war crimes, just a few
[3:41:17] <theobble> national?
[3:41:18] <%tigerfang86> SOME MISTAKES, A COUPLE
[3:41:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> The fact that Yuta's the only one who's bothered by this makes him out to be the most gigantic piece of shit
[3:41:18] <+bear_breaker20> OTTOMON EMPIRE FUCK NAH
[3:41:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Bit of an understatement, my dude
[3:41:19] <mar_krow> mistakes
[3:41:19] <%shiplord13> A lot of death and hatred
[3:41:19] <$rdark_ksu> a tumultuous relationship so to speak?
[3:41:19] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> GEE YA DO'NT SAY?!?!
[3:41:20] <+vicar_anat> Thats a certain way to phrase it....
[3:41:21] <%enickma11> *Looks at Nanking* Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat naaaaaawwwwwwwwww
[3:41:22] <%Reizie_Etherealm> PERHAPS
[3:41:23] <Ion_Laser> When WWII happened, SHIT GOT NUTS
[3:41:24] <TheBlankAce> There have been many misgivings
[3:41:25] <majindusto> Secret Chinese, One Child Laws and Racism
[3:41:25] <bearwagon> wut are you talking about Pat WW2 doesnt exist
[3:41:25] <+Grayson_XLS> Just a little GENOCIDE, that's all.
[3:41:26] <GandhiTheTerrible> just deny it
[3:41:26] <T_Sasquatch> very true
[3:41:26] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> JAPANESE GRUDGE
[3:41:27] <%spiritofmojave> More than just a few, MAAAAYBE
[3:41:28] <gunzerkingdunce> Asians are racist even to ourselves
[3:41:28] <SeventyForce> Pat, pat PAT. You need to stop trying this water. Like now lawl.
[3:41:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> The word Understatement is an Understatement
[3:41:29] <GoldeNOVA> A war crime or two
[3:41:29] <CurrySauseBandit> Too be fair all of Asia kind of hates each other. Even if they don't share major atrocities.
[3:41:31] <%mayorrev> @AngriestPat when does this game take place again?
[3:41:33] <InugamiTheHound> every nation commit war crimes right
[3:41:34] <redial_nick> perhaps there is still some bad blood after all

[3:45:57] <Elofhousewood> @headsheldhigh exactly
[3:46:01] <+Grayson_XLS> I guess it's for the best that he never learned what sex is.
[3:46:01] <alexandrecau> Wait does Ryuji knows about sex
[3:46:01] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> These belly warmers are fucking the worst.
[3:46:02] <TheLakinessMonster> The knowledge of sex saps a man's strength. That's why Dante beats Vergil.
[3:46:03] <%bread_assassin> You can't tell me that after the Yakuza 2 ending, him and Kaoru didn't fuck.
[3:46:12] <President_valentine> The Kiryu not knowing what sex is one of the dumbest things people pass off

Also most jobber enemies should have those high damage guns. And it needs to be in new york. Call it: Yakuza World, The Fists that Never Sleep.

[4:07:04] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Well, I guess I get to kill you in his stead.
[4:07:06] <RiverBirch> So youre my outlet for whoever ran over my daughter!
[4:07:10] <hassanico> Again the guy orchestrating all this shit is just an evil Japanese shipbuilding dude...
[4:07:12] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> Kiryu is going to actually commit a murder
[4:07:12] <squirtkitten> Kiryu is legit going to kill a bitch
[4:07:16] <alexandrecau> everyone knew who yuta fucked
[4:07:18] <+bear_breaker20> Oh you looked really cool dude, too bad you gotta die now
[4:07:18] <%shiplord13> @AngriestPat All four of the main bad guys were in the car together when Haruka got hit.
[4:07:19] <+griffball13> oops
[4:07:20] <RiverBirch> I'm gonna absolutely kill you!
[4:07:20] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 so I finally found something that I hate (supermarket-wise) worse than shoppers leaving perishables like meat wherever the hell they want. It's when shoppers use the mobility scooters with the shopping cart, despite being PERFECTLY PHYSICALLY FIT. They are NOT pregnant, nor old, ill, obese, or injured. These are just LAZY fucks who screw over the actual disabled people who need them by occupying them and running out the batteries. It makes me want to take a pipe to their legs so that
[4:07:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> Oh...Taksukawa is a legit dead man walking now
[4:07:23] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> He drove a car at her.
[4:07:24] <+Grayhammatter> kiryu bout to snap
[4:07:34] <alexandrecau> their one night stand was recorded
[4:07:35] <%NWR_James> Don't get Kiryu involved! GOD
[4:07:42] <Tophat12> Tatsukawa already got murdered by Ed
[4:07:51] <%Reizie_Etherealm> They were all doing the what is love dance in the car
[4:07:59] <%castcode> oh god
[4:08:06] <alexandrecau> @doc_ock_rokc ed killed him after making himwatch his girlfriend tortured, bit late for that
[4:08:26] <foxhounder29> pat mgs5 is a good game
[4:08:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> @alexandrecau thanks for the update i haven't been watching because life
[4:08:42] <VanLynx> !uptime
[4:08:43] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 8m.
[4:08:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Kirby_Sauce I used to hate it when people hid shit in behind stuff on the shelves or in the produce. Like actual poop.
[4:08:50] <hassanico> @doc_ock_rokc catch up on the vods, the game rules
[4:08:56] <+Grayhammatter> kiryu would have
[4:08:59] <hassanico> @doc_ock_rokc but also good luck with life
[4:09:08] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Probably did forget.
[4:09:09] <+Darren716> @AngriestPat What do you think is a more contrived reason for Kiryu getting involved in a Yakuza plot. Saejima washing up on his beach, or Haruka randomly having a kid with the future leader of the tria
[4:09:11] <%salty_syd913> ooooh you are so dead
[4:09:13] <$Plutt_bug> Yakuza is super dope
[4:09:23] <alexandrecau> @doc_ock_rokc also it's all because haruto is biracial
[4:09:35] <%tigerfang86> YEAH DO IT
[4:09:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> EVIL
[4:09:36] <+Grayhammatter> DICK KICK

[4:09:55] <+senfood> Them forgetting that Kiryu is a mushroom cloud laying motherfucker is the only explanation for them doing something so stupid.

[4:10:34] <redial_nick> she got pregnant by the car
[4:10:35] <BunnyEmperor> SMIERED
[4:10:35] <%Reizie_Etherealm> It's better to go up and over the hood than to get RUN OVER
[4:10:37] <InugamiTheHound> so it was accident
[4:10:37] <+PenmanLupine> she should be fuckin dead
[4:10:37] <mar_krow> why is she not dead
[4:10:37] <squirtkitten> but at that speed it would have killed her
[4:10:38] <Jontman42> You did the opposite of jumping against a car
[4:10:39] <%tigerfang86> jump WHERE
[4:10:40] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 they ACTUALLY need them. I have similar feelings towards people who waste time and electricity using the handicaped door opening buttons on campus, when they could just easily open a door. I once saw a 5 person line wait for the library door to slowly open for what was about a minute, while I just opened the door next to them and walked in. Stop wasting my time, the city's electricity, and stop with the repeated use of those door, they're starting to break down and run slow now.
[4:10:40] <RantingRavager> use a HEAT MOVE
[4:10:43] <mar_krow> wtf
[4:10:46] <%AncelDeLambert> she would not be in a coma, she would be crippled
[4:10:47] <+Deano8817> also Haruto confirmed way fucking stronger then ethan's son
[4:10:48] <RiverBirch> Haruto would've become strawberry jam
[4:10:49] <+Grayhammatter> she SHOULD be dead
[4:10:49] <mar_krow> ikr pat
[4:10:51] <+vicar_anat> should've throw the baby, someone would have caught it
[4:10:51] <+cvp5127> shhhh
[4:10:51] <Dest_121> she should have a smear on the pavement
[4:10:53] <%AncelDeLambert> her pelvis is now GOO
[4:10:54] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Yeah, they would be giblets.
[4:10:54] <%Reizie_Etherealm> She would be splattered
[4:10:55] <+griffball13> its true
[4:11:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> Multiple smears....
[4:11:01] <+butch_deadlift> haruka was raised by kiryu shes tough as shit
[4:11:02] <$Plutt_bug> i've seen pictures on websites. they should be dead
[4:11:03] <+bear_breaker20> good thing its just a game
[4:11:03] <Ominnous> her spine would have snapped by even a tiny scrape
[4:11:05] <Mr_Strut> She used a defensive heat move
[4:11:05] <+miguelrod777> KIRYUS DAUGHTER TOUGH
[4:11:05] <Dr_Mooose> they have plot armor
[4:11:08] <+HellCopter> it's because moms are tough

[4:28:34] <+bear_breaker20> Pat has worked ina grocer that right LUL
[4:28:34] <%Emperor_Machinus> PEOPLE
[4:28:37] <reonome> employees are not allowed to put back perishables because they don't know how long they've been out
[4:28:40] <+Centrilion> I found rotten beef AT OFFICE DEPOT!
[4:28:40] <+Grayhammatter> goddamn ANIMALS
[4:28:42] <takiyami> Isn't that literally like the biggest expense at most grocery stores?
[4:28:43] <+TheBitingIrish> NANI THE FUCK
[4:28:43] <NeroInfinite> Yeah it's super easy as a stocker to ignore like 50 lbs of perishable shit.
[4:28:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> I think we need to do manditory kneecaping for people who do that shit
[4:28:44] <RichAnvils> why do you do it pat?
[4:28:45] <%salty_syd913> ive seen someone leave a frozen turkey next to paper towels
[4:28:45] <$Ralfclogs> Garbage people
[4:28:48] <Dr_Mooose> suck it up, walk back to where it's supposed to be
[4:28:48] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Same morons who don't recognize that a lane is closing and suddenly decide to merge 2 seconds before the end.
[4:28:48] <%salty_syd913> shit sucked
[4:28:49] <BobaFetish2124> I've seen it
[4:28:52] <Endocrom> I've seen frozen tv dinners in with the ramen
[4:28:53] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Can Confirm
[4:28:54] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Those people needs to be lined up and shot, with tazers
[4:28:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> That too

[4:29:01] <Astaroth130> i can confirm
[4:29:02] <%TheSniperJoe> He was wearing a suit.
[4:29:03] <%SilvaChariot0133> Racing the scooters
[4:29:05] <Kemmybelle> So many people do that. You ruin the perishable and if it melts onto anything else, you ruin that too.
[4:29:07] <takiyami> We're all being destroyed by time if you think about it
[4:29:09] <%THATGUY_789> the worst is the deli which is grabbed and wrapped for the purpose of taking it home

[4:30:56] <$Ralfclogs> LUL
[4:30:57] <%ECRead> evil defeated
[4:30:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat I've had one issue where my stepdad who recently had knee surgery but wasn't strong enough to do a complete shopping trip grabbed a mobility scooter and he got unending shit for being "Fit but lazy"
[4:30:57] <@Fuggins4U> same here
[4:30:57] <%Keaton_x> I was once rammed into oncoming traffic because some fuck decided he didn't want to turn right in the right turn only lane. Some people shouldn't be allowed to live...
[4:31:00] <+Grayhammatter> bound to happen
[4:31:02] <@lewdskeletor13> I remember you telling this story before
[4:31:05] <smallmiightt> She will never die

[4:31:25] <%THATGUY_789> roaming the streets causing mayhem to all in retail
[4:31:31] <@lewdskeletor13> I don’t believe that
[4:31:38] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 there need to be a capital punishment for this behavior. I reccomend a slow 5 day death sentence in an acid bath. Followed by a summary kick to the jaw. (Thanks for the idea TTS). I once found a 5 lb slab of meat someone hid behind the hair dye. And someone in chat said "you don't know if they're disabled " I do when they stand up, they're teenagers racing carts, and lazy young moms. You know the type.
[4:31:38] <@lewdskeletor13> DansGame

[4:32:44] <+TheBitingIrish> Man, fuck Eureka = -=
[4:32:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> Napalm is a solution.
