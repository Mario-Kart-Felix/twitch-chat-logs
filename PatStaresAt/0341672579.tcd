[0:09:06] <derap41> All but 2
[0:09:06] <%ssjklyco> i can see you doing that
[0:09:12] <Djinnazz> Darksouls. Demonsouls is rough
[0:09:12] <%AncelDeLambert> play 2 last
[0:09:14] <%Spydurman> bee cubes
[0:09:15] <b1gboss007> NO, avoid ds2 like the plague
[0:09:15] <+TsunamiPoro> or just play bloodborne
[0:09:15] <+Taxerus> demons souls has no online no more tho
[0:09:16] <Nepsotic> except not dark souls 2
[0:09:18] <Drunkbydawn> Dark Souls 2 is fiiiiiiine
[0:09:19] <$NocturneNovember> Aw yeah, I love me some War Souls! Or is it Darkframe?
[0:09:20] <%crimsonharvest> Pat have you ever played King's Field games? I looked at that shit and it seemed both broken and wild.
[0:09:20] <Coystick> Bee Souls
[0:09:23] <MettleWolf> Well there's the Souls HD collection
[0:09:23] <+metalsiren31> I would say Dark Souls 1 since DeS online is down
[0:09:23] <%mordred_t> @AngriestPat Did you see how hype Matt and Woolie got during the villain reveals in Kingdom Hearts?
[0:09:24] <+Taxerus> so no pvp = not souls
[0:09:25] <+Chud_Pudsley> I'm here!
[0:09:25] <%AncelDeLambert> and only play 2 for the completion of the lore
[0:09:26] <derap41> Don't start at 2 its to far from the others
[0:09:30] <+Zerodyne90> nioh
[0:09:33] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Why ever play Dark Souls when Crash Bandicoot is the same series?
[0:09:35] <Kalcom> play scholar
[0:09:35] <Doomtastic> ds2 isnt that bad. purists are always gunna say that ds2 sucks but as a "game", its not bad
[0:09:35] <+Chud_Pudsley> They're not good games.
[0:09:39] <%goose_attack_almanac> Did you fall for Paige because of her sick square jaw?
[0:09:42] <%shen4u> Pat did you see the god cow thats 6foot 4inches tall?
[0:09:43] <Nepsotic> dark souls 2 is an okay souls-like
[0:09:43] <OwlLightningMage> Bees and cubes suck DansGame
[0:09:43] <mayorrev> @angriestpat should I get dethcube
[0:09:45] <+TsunamiPoro> can you use the holy moonlight sword as a dildo?
[0:09:45] <+Taxerus> 2 sucks unless you can't get enough souls
[0:09:48] <%FackinCrazy> Ds2 has the most replay value just from build verity
[0:09:51] <%NovaKnightmare> Do you think Gwyn would say the F word?
[0:09:51] <+Superkbrown95> how did Paige beat sense into you when you went on your Twitter rant?

[0:36:52] <Coystick> Not true
[0:36:52] <%RNGsusDied4Wins> cheer500 Hey Pat. Have you gone back to Divinity 2 and tried the definitive edition. I never finished a playthrough and it seems like a good reason to go back.
[0:36:54] <deviljhojho94> SPACE COWBOYS

[0:37:05] <$Mornaka> Space wester noir
[0:37:08] <+LogothX> Sy Fy
[0:37:08] <+mugwugsampoo> Cowboy Bebop is overrated
[0:37:09] <Vorsun> Death and Rebirth are great because of Refrain of the Soul
[0:37:09] <$Piemono> No way
[0:37:10] <%bigfado287> The genre Cowboy Bebop
[0:37:10] <gorillahandz> god I want Bebop on Netflix
[0:37:11] <+Chud_Pudsley> What about Samurai Bebop? Oops I mean Samurai Champloo
[0:37:11] <Coystick> Champloo>Bebop
[0:37:12] <Finaldragoon> Outlaw Star is just a better Cowboy Bebop, don't @ me
[0:37:13] <Prism_Wing> More like Cowboy Sleepbob.
[0:37:15] <OwlLightningMage> Black Lagoon is kinda Bebop
[0:37:18] <TheEnablerr> Time to watch all the EVA merch skyrocket in price again! Like that $1400 Gshock
[0:37:20] <%skizzuto> cowboy bepis
[0:37:20] <deviljhojho94> Let firefly stay dead. Bury it. Consider it a mercy

[0:37:24] <+LogothX> Ask Woolie all about it on twitter!
[0:37:24] <derap41> What about trigun
[0:37:24] <$Niney_Who> @AngriestPat What about Trigun? Or Gurren Lagann?

[0:37:31] <Mr_Strut> And Outlaw Star
[0:37:34] <+Dovakhin573> A fucked up part me wants to see Pat and Simmons argue about EVA
[0:37:36] <OwlLightningMage> Black Lagoon is Bebop but depressing
[0:37:36] <b1gboss007> S is just an episodic slice of life
[0:37:36] <%SuperCasualBoom> @angriestpat Might be blu-ray but Pat would say it‚Äôs Purple-Ray.
[0:37:37] <commsquirrel> It did and then was immediately put back down
[0:37:42] <Prism_Wing> More like Cowboy Buttbop

[0:48:49] <TheEnablerr> Paige is just female Guts.
[0:48:51] <tacostarvedbeast> The whip
[0:48:51] <OwlLightningMage> Don't correct Pat
[0:48:55] <%AncelDeLambert> HIDE
[0:48:56] <%izaich> If Paige is Guts, then does that make Pat Casca?
[0:48:57] <Endocrom> "How did this giant die?" "repeated blows to it's shins."
[0:48:58] <CheekyBirb> i hope paige continues dragon's dogma
[0:49:00] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> I fucking hate that Greatsword.
[0:49:01] <Doomtastic> @AngriestPat do you like the friede's great scythe? the weapon art is great for pvp and boss burning
[0:49:03] <cizal11> god these fire fuckers are the worst
[0:49:04] <Jontman42> Paige isn't cool enough to be Guts
[0:49:04] <%crimsonharvest> Femguts
[0:49:09] <kamen_advent> She's still a cripple
[0:49:10] <%AncelDeLambert> Guts doesn't have an arm?
[0:49:10] <Make_me_mad> I was always bummed the Gravelord sword never came back in the later games. That thing was great.
[0:49:10] <%krymzen5> instread of loosing an arm she got lupus
[0:49:13] <CheekyBirb> she's basically one eyes already
[0:49:15] <+jaggiesama> too ginger
[0:49:16] <Graywolf_the_45th> She refuses to die
[0:49:18] <%izaich> She has lupus, it's close enough.
[0:49:19] <%Remery_> Didn't lose any limbs but Lupus cancels it out
[0:49:22] <Personified134> if Pat is Casca, then who has to be the one to become a godhand and rape him
[0:49:24] <+metalsiren31> Friede's weapon art is parry bait
[0:49:24] <%dreampipe332> Literally too mustard filled to die
[0:49:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> fem guts is a top tier waifu
[0:49:25] <%crimsonharvest> Femguts has an autoimmune disorder instead of being an amputee
[0:49:30] <Deku_Scribe> Pats the dude that gets killed by guts in the opening scene of the movie
[0:49:31] <TheBigO75> Leg disabled?
[0:49:32] <Bailey__gaming> we going for hyper doggie?
[0:49:33] <tacostarvedbeast> I hope Paige just stumbles into that hermit purple build
[0:49:34] <%Remery_> Ate poison and Glass
[0:49:35] <olwe123> Can't hear her
[0:49:35] <+mastertwin2> Pat wouldn't be Casca, he's Puck
[0:49:37] <BeNiceImShy> Saying Paige has 1 eye is practically an overestimation of her sight abilities

[0:50:10] <$GohanEgret> if pat has the candy closet, what is paige's equivalent for McD's
[0:50:13] <DestroyerDJ8> pat had the candy closet, paige has the mcdonalds corner

[0:52:38] <grayjammer> Oh! I've also got that same weird hiccup!!!!
[0:52:40] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat did you take a look in pontiff's ice sword?
[0:52:41] <blackbaron98> @deviljhojho94 ITS TREWAY
[0:52:41] <$nademonkey1100> tht is straight up the dog from berserk
[0:52:42] <+Superkbrown95> her weird hiccup= vomiting?
[0:52:44] <%dreampipe332> yeah but what about that Japan game
[0:52:46] <Jontman42> I hope there's big Berserk in Sekiro
[0:52:46] <deviljhojho94> Yes, this is what I want, I like this
[0:52:47] <kamen_advent> Pat is Casca because he is mentally broken from the Eclipse that was the Grocery Store
[0:52:48] <DRAGKUDO> didn't know you guys were that close with Elmo
[0:52:48] <%Zael913> If only they would make a good Berserk game?!?!
[0:52:49] <TheEnablerr> Another "weird" oddity from Paige, add it to the list!
[0:52:54] <%superc37> well miyazaki, specifically
[0:52:55] <danknugglit> hot
[0:52:58] <T_Sasquatch> that dog is in bloodborne too LUL
[0:52:58] <deviljhojho94> @blackbaron98 my man
[0:53:01] <OwlLightningMage> I want them to make a Berserk game so bad BibleThump
[0:53:03] <eco419> Cute
[0:53:04] <LiquidMathew> Berserk hasn't updated in forever and its bullshit, Casca shit was finally happening
[0:53:05] <+TransporterX7> ELMO IS PUCK YES
[0:53:06] <+TeraMercier> You can lure them one at a time and fight in the alcove near the ladder
[0:53:09] <Prism_Wing> It's also kinda the dog from Hellsing.
[0:53:14] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat it has 110 too like vordt's mace, you should take a look
[0:53:14] <deviljhojho94> You will never get a berserk game and neither will I
[0:53:18] <Djinnazz> a GOOD one.
[0:53:20] <+thebestestkevin> @kamen_advent this fucking guy deserves a medal for that comment LOL
[0:53:20] <%forevern2dust> But they all suck
[0:53:20] <OwlLightningMage> I don't count these
[0:53:20] <derap41> Yeah but like a good one
[0:53:21] <AlasterAngelo> and they were all awful
[0:53:23] <+Chud_Pudsley> And they're all just mob beaters
[0:53:24] <SwindlerOfProgress> I read Berserk between the DS3 LP and now and holy shit, I didn't know how much of a ripoff those monsters were.
[0:53:25] <CheekyBirb> there's a berserk game on steam n o?
[0:53:25] <EASrake> Also there's Dragon's Dogma
[0:53:26] <brominefromspace> and they all suck
[0:53:26] <%Remery_> quiet vomits are the scariest had a kid in school who would sneaily vomit and we could only tell he did from the smell
[0:53:29] <Personified134> There is a good berserk game, its called Dark Souls people
[0:53:32] <tacostarvedbeast> That‚Äôs the sound of Paige‚Äôs killing intent
[0:53:32] <%NovaKnightmare> Dark Souls 4: the Berserk 2
[0:53:34] <+TransporterX7> Pat is Casca, Paige is Griffith, ELMO IS PUCK CONFIRMED
[0:53:37] <+Chud_Pudsley> Pontiff Curved Sword
[0:53:38] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Make a berserk game where you play as Griffith
[0:53:38] <kamen_advent> Berserk has bad luck with video games and anime
[0:53:39] <Jontman42> Who's Griffith then? Woolie?
[0:53:43] <$Mendin> Attempt #1: Invaded a world with a Host + Phantom + Moundmaker, so we had a jolly fracas
[0:53:46] <OwlLightningMage> Casca will be the final boss of Berserk
[0:53:47] <blackbaron98> @deviljhojho94 that kid's going to jail for sure tho, you dont get out of a rico charge
[0:53:48] <+mastertwin2> If you break it down enough, a Berserk game would just be Devil may Cry with a bigger sword
[0:53:48] <derap41> I want a Bersek universe game
[0:53:49] <+Superkbrown95> Pat must enjoy the fact that Paige is quiet when she gags MindManners
[0:53:50] <TheyCallMeVawn> Use an arrow to pull one of them you coward
[0:53:50] <%izaich> Skellmo = Skull Knight?
[0:53:53] <cizal11> just try really hard to only pull one
[0:53:54] <deviljhojho94> Paige would use the behelith just to fuck with pat
[0:53:57] <AlasterAngelo> Matt is Skull Knight
[0:53:59] <$Mornaka> Is skelmo guts?
[0:54:02] <%NovaKnightmare> look at that fat dead asshole in the corner
[0:54:04] <Nepsotic> pat your game is bullshit, i keep getting "unable to join session" and I just KNOW it's you
[0:54:11] <+TransporterX7> !!!!!!! MATT AS SKULL KNIGHT IS PERFECT
[0:54:11] <OwlLightningMage> @Superkbrown95 LUL
[0:54:14] <%krymzen5> shelmo is donavan?
[0:54:16] <deviljhojho94> @blackbaron98 Yeah it's pretty much over man. He didnt even wait to get old to fuck up like Suge knight
[0:54:18] <SulfurousAcid> it's just a lightining watchdog of the old lords
[0:54:21] <grayjammer> A Good Boy
[0:54:23] <+photas10> did he/is he doing the dlc?
[0:54:24] <Personified134> Liam is Griffith, he sacrifices the best friends to achieve Superstar Streamer status and Paige must avenge them
[0:54:24] <OwlLightningMage> Matt was born to be Skull Knight
[0:54:25] <%SaltyDongs> who is steve?
[0:54:26] <Mr_Strut> That's just the beast from berserk
[0:54:27] <Endocrom> A big ol' pupper
[0:54:28] <tacostarvedbeast> Paige would turn the oceans to mustard
[0:54:31] <CheekyBirb> just swing pat Kappa
[0:54:33] <Jontman42> Woolie would instantly use the behelit so it fits
[0:54:34] <TheEnablerr> Pupper Snuffed
[0:54:37] <cizal11> jesus christ this thing is strong
[0:54:38] <%xxviios> ded
[0:54:40] <gorillahandz> I'm honestly shocked nobody's let Miyazaki make his dream Berserk game. You would think giving the man who created DARK SOULS the IP would be a safe bet. And I know he likes to do his own thing, but c'mon, he'd clearly make an exception for Berserk
[0:54:41] <+Ssaik> !uptime
[0:54:42] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 59m 3s.
[0:54:42] <@Mechz71> so like what is bloodborne doing in here

[0:54:49] <+Ssaik> Oh hey I'm not that late!
[0:54:50] <AlasterAngelo> woolie would instantly use the behelit and sell all of humanity for a jetpack
[0:54:58] <tacostarvedbeast> Pup snuffers
[0:55:00] <danknugglit> Its only when you kill both pat
[0:55:00] <deviljhojho94> woolie is my spirit animal
[0:55:01] <ape_hawk> the FAP ring
[0:55:06] <gorillahandz> wait the FaP is in this game?
[0:55:13] <+TransporterX7> Liam as Griffith is ALSO PERFECT
[0:55:14] <+king_wragles> I see Pat is still using hammer-chan, good
[0:55:14] <%izaich> id make a berserk game thats basically boat simulator 2018
[0:55:15] <OwlLightningMage> Behelit for jetpack is the worst trade yet LUL

[0:59:17] <santafer> Hey Pat, how many playthroughs of this game have you done?
[0:59:18] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> USE A PATWORD
[0:59:24] <sodium_station> FAP +3 is pretty great tho
[0:59:26] <+TransporterX7> So friendly reminder, Pat=Casca, Paige=Guts, Liam=Griffith, Elmo=Puck, Matt=Skull Knight.
[0:59:33] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat sorry i got confused
[0:59:36] <+Chud_Pudsley> POntiff's blade is the fire UGS
[0:59:40] <TheEnablerr> Pat has FAPped, now he dresses up well afterward to continue on his way
[0:59:41] <+RowenCleric> What is Woolie though?
[0:59:42] <tacostarvedbeast> I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if pat one day started a cult
[0:59:46] <OwlLightningMage> Woolie is the sword
[0:59:46] <Tampaoster> @TransporterX7 And What about woolie?
[0:59:48] <eco419> Woolie= Griffith
[0:59:53] <%Zael913> @TransporterX7 And is Woollie the boat?
[0:59:54] <$NocturneNovember> Woolie is the Wolf
[0:59:55] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat so is pats discord now called the pat earth society?
[0:59:59] <Jontman42> I put Woolie as Griffith and Liam as Rickert
[0:59:59] <SlayrideTwinsinner> Woolie is the Sword
[1:00:01] <sosuke5> @RowenCleric Rape horse
[1:00:03] <OwlLightningMage> WOOLIE IS THE BOAT LUL
[1:00:04] <SulfurousAcid> Woolie = Schierkie
[1:00:05] <Prism_Wing> @transporterx7 Woolie = Mosgus?
[1:00:05] <Kayjeld> @tacostarvedbeast It's like Jonestown but everyone's a short, ginger Canadian.
[1:00:06] <+jaggiesama> Nani patoricku
[1:00:10] <+Chud_Pudsley> If there was a stick weapon in DS I would be down to main that.
[1:00:15] <eco419> Woolie is the boat
[1:00:17] <+Reevesypoo> tbh Pat is Griffith, he would do anything for immortality :)
[1:00:29] <Jontman42> Because Rickert/Liam wasn't around when shit went down
[1:00:32] <OwlLightningMage> The deep is so dumb
[1:00:33] <Coystick> Hit the back gem
[1:00:33] <SlayrideTwinsinner> So he's from that AU where Griffith got Casca
[1:00:35] <sparrrow_> very deep
[1:00:35] <$vectorcannonready> Woolie is Tarkus
[1:00:37] <SlayrideTwinsinner> And nothing bad happened.
[1:00:51] <cizal11> he becomes strong
[1:00:51] <SulfurousAcid> sucks only if you hate fun

[1:16:41] <HyperBomb21> DS2 is my favorite of the series.
[1:16:44] <Melchior_the_Wise> That's how pat looks on the inside.
[1:16:49] <%Keyd00d> DS2 is a fine game

[1:17:17] <itsya_boi_gappy> pat no warframe?
[1:17:22] <+metalsiren31> The biggest problem with DS2 is that they named it "Dark Souls". If they had called it King Souls or something it would have gone over way better
[1:17:23] <SwindlerOfProgress> That helmet looks terrible.
[1:17:25] <HyperBomb21> It's almost like every Souls game is reallly great

[1:52:42] <grayjammer> It ends like every other quest in DS3
[1:52:42] <+gael_jebidibah> Big sad
[1:52:45] <MrPedrovsky> ATTENTION all ashen ones Anri needs your help in her quest and for that she needs a couple of estus flasks. To help her simply put your credit card number, three digits on the back and the expectation date. But hurry so she could secure that epic victory royale !!!!
[1:52:45] <SuperMintSoda> I think she gives you the lucky ted sword
[1:52:45] <danknugglit> It removes your pride
[1:52:46] <EMP_Ike_Turner> ButtBleed the sequel to BloodBorne
[1:52:47] <admiralsatan> kill that bitch
[1:52:48] <Coystick> I'M SURE IT WILL END WELL
[1:52:49] <brwnsugar> that was completely your fault
[1:52:50] <%Tarantulawl> If you die in Astoria you die in real life!!!
[1:52:51] <+NWR_James> You went to Greed Island and it turns out it was just a way for your father to get your face beat in by his adult friends
[1:52:54] <OwlLightningMage> DON'T LOOK PAIGE
[1:53:05] <Melchior_the_Wise> Can Anri Die either?
[1:53:08] <dekkitout> youre telling me paige cant see this hype ass looking boss

[1:53:10] <+jaggiesama> Super wont remember
[1:53:11] <MrPedrovsky> ATTENTION all ashen ones Anri needs your help in her quest and for that she needs a couple of estus flasks. To help her simply put your credit card number, three digits on the back and the expectation date. But hurry so she could secure that epic victory royale !!
[1:53:11] <eco419> yes
[1:53:11] <Coystick> Anri lives on a farm IT'S FINE
[1:53:11] <%DrFacilier> i thought itd be cool if you fought Aldrich as just a blob but then phase 2 hits to reveal Gwyndolin
[1:53:11] <Jontman42> I like how Anri talks over the boss health bar
[1:53:12] <cizal11> he completely forgot
[1:53:13] <+TransporterX7> Oh, FYI, if Anri dies it is over tho
[1:53:16] <+king_wragles> Paige don't look at the screen, it's only like really REALLY cool shit n stuff
[1:53:19] <%AncelDeLambert> @MrPedrovsky Anri needs Amazon gift cards to defeat her enemies, QUICK
[1:53:21] <thebehatted> anri can die but you can try it again
[1:53:24] <valdorick> She goes down on you super hard, and then you highfive in a freeze frame naked as the credits roll... Because its Dark Souls, so NOTHING sad happens at the end of NPC quests involving the Dark Sign
[1:53:25] <periaph> aldrich was able to oneshot me with his magic my first playthrough, fun times
[1:53:29] <IShadowStrykerI> Aldrich is the worst
[1:53:32] <admiralsatan> yeyeyeyeye

[1:53:52] <eco419> D;
[1:53:52] <captainthunderwolf> @NWR_James HunterxHunter is a story about a karate boy seeking his father, and his father who built an entire island out of parental neglect and left it behind just to say, "Get fucked, I'm not here."
[1:53:54] <%AncelDeLambert> Anri just tanks it LUL
[1:53:56] <+Nobrev> does aldrich have a gravelord sword on a stick
[1:53:58] <+MarshallLee67> @AngriestPat after you do this you get her sword from ludleth, and then she will appear hostile in one of two locations depending on whether or not you told her what happened to horace
[1:54:01] <Melchior_the_Wise> part 1 done

[1:54:33] <SuperMintSoda> would you become a slime-monster to eat gwndolins bottom half?
[1:54:35] <OwlLightningMage> Now you still have to beat the boss
[1:54:36] <+AXL808> funny how you have to run in circles like a jackass once Aldrich makes his arrows chase you
[1:54:40] <$awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 pat, 2 messages ago Paige misread a my text, didn't say you were anti-ork, said you were AN anti-ork. That belief affecting reality thing this the gestalt field, was saying how crazy talk has the inverse effect
[1:54:41] <eco419> Big F

[1:54:55] <Scharfster> Gotta beat the boss first
[1:54:55] <thebehatted> near the first bonfire at cathedral of the deep
[1:54:57] <%Zael913> @SuperMintSoda Yes, without a doubt. No I'm not gay
[1:54:58] <deviljhojho94> this questline is a big ball of nothing
[1:54:59] <NiftyNox> Just wallowing around on the floor
[1:55:01] <ArcticAsylum> She goes to him and he kills her
[1:55:01] <bsmusic> cathedral
[1:55:02] <%RedMaskBandit> Main boss?/
[1:55:03] <eco419> to the Pit
[1:55:03] <+NWR_James> @captainthunderwolf it's not neglect when you arrange for your karateboy to get beaten up. It's opposite of neglect, it's active malice.
[1:55:05] <deviljhojho94> Much like most ds3 questlines
[1:55:05] <+averyoddjew> She goes to find him and dies
[1:55:06] <Shraquet> Talk to Ludleth.
[1:55:08] <%Divryne> SHE DEAD IF YOU TELL HER.
[1:55:10] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat estus shard

[1:55:18] <+Press_X_ToJASON> no, shes at the place you got that shieldf
[1:55:20] <%Divryne> Cause Horace kills her ass.
[1:55:21] <+MarshallLee67> if you DIDN'T tell her, she will be near cathedral of the deep bonfire where you got the crest shield. if you DID tell her she's in the smouldering lake where you fought horace
[1:55:22] <OwlLightningMage> Ging is an attempted murderer. Make no mistake
[1:55:23] <%AlasterAngelo> should've put a ring on her
[1:55:28] <TW2SElite> Is Paige streaming rn?
[1:55:29] <bsmusic> CHAT IS WING
[1:55:31] <%forevern2dust> but horace is already dead?
[1:55:31] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> she's dead either way LUL
[1:55:35] <bsmusic> *wrong
[1:55:35] <+jaggiesama> Daily reminder Goblin slayer sucks

[2:03:02] <+sana_kan> I wanna be a super mutant but not the dumb kind. the fun kind
[2:03:09] <captainthunderwolf> Lucky is better, but That Gun is great.

[2:03:16] <Kayjeld> @AngriestPat I can see why a garbage salesmen is attractive to you, you're already a youtuber.
[2:03:18] <Worldbrand> @pleasenameyourcharacter zephyr's kit is mostly built around conveniences like mobility, invulnerability to projectiles, breaking crates, and emergency CC. it's very... unfocused, but turbulence is her highlight
[2:03:20] <Jontman42> So Pat would be Trashcan Carla
[2:03:22] <OwlLightningMage> @pleasenameyourcharacter you can aim at the ground to to that
[2:03:22] <SuperMintSoda> best gun is the Landshark gun from armed and dangerous
[2:03:25] <Yummy_Nukes> garbage vendor Pat and his magic Kalashnikov
[2:03:26] <$Mornaka> you ok Paige?
[2:03:27] <IShadowStrykerI> hey pat, after you're done with ds3 would you think about a DS2 miracle build run

[2:03:45] <ArcticAsylum> LUL
[2:03:53] <captainthunderwolf> @deviljhojho94 If you go hard on the revolver crit builds, That Gun and Lucky can both do rocket-launcher damage on headshots in VATS by the endgame, it's fucking nuts.
[2:03:54] <+jaggiesama> Id be felicia day with a power fist
[2:03:54] <$Mornaka> that was like a gasp craok
[2:03:55] <+sogeki_dan> This isn't Let's go Eevee! What the hell Pat?
[2:04:02] <dekkitout> hr isnt for voicing complaints, its for getting your ass under the bus, asap ResidentSleeper
[2:04:04] <SuperMintSoda> POISE
[2:04:10] <OwlLightningMage> @pleasenameyourcharacter You do a fairly low damage divebomb
[2:04:14] <$awsomesaucekirby> BBBOOOOO
[2:04:15] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> @worldbrand "unfocused" is a good way to put it. fun... but unfocused.
[2:04:16] <%DrFacilier> pikachu is better anyways
[2:04:16] <%Chichen> Pat's a Let's Go Pikachu kinda guy
[2:04:20] <DracaenaLeaf> 8th gen when

[2:04:24] <Prism_Wing> SwiftRage
[2:04:26] <SulfurousAcid> Pat prefers Let's Go Pikachu
[2:04:26] <deviljhojho94> @captainthunderwolf That's my go to build for independent! Looks phenomenal with the Spade coat
[2:04:28] <+king_wragles> Well, it's time to turn on Pat for not liking a trend
[2:04:29] <OwlLightningMage> NO RANDOM BATTLES FUCK THAT
[2:04:29] <admiralsatan> Remember when Vince beat God at pay per view
[2:04:30] <%topendbuzz> and it makes it better
[2:04:31] <+LogothX> and there's no abilities or held items
[2:04:32] <Kayjeld> The let's go games look so trash, seriously.
[2:04:34] <SuperMintSoda> it's a pokemon game without all the pokemon stuff
[2:04:35] <Credfield_> It's still good though
[2:04:35] <+NWR_James> right away
[2:04:37] <%Aitch971> Its actually so damn fun though
[2:04:37] <+gael_jebidibah> I just wanna pet Eevee
[2:04:37] <$awsomesaucekirby> BODIED
[2:04:40] <%topendbuzz> who fights wilds
[2:04:43] <+zcrawford2> It's actually way better.
[2:04:45] <+jaggiesama> Lets go back to the store more like
[2:04:46] <+cvp5127> its a chill pkmn game
[2:04:46] <moogleboy1984> I really should go back and finish DS2...
[2:04:50] <$awsomesaucekirby> They ruined BLUE
[2:04:51] <dekkitout> also no abilities, so yay?
[2:04:52] <$Wafflum> Aldritch cares Kappa
[2:04:53] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Remember Vince‚Äôs Kiss My Ass Club
[2:04:53] <OwlLightningMage> They should just make an official Pokemon MMO
[2:04:53] <+LogothX> Its just a crappy spin off
[2:04:54] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> @owllightningmage I meant in general. I haven't used the fly power since I'm power leveling, so no need.
[2:04:55] <Credfield_> I hated the idea but now I'm 80 hours in grinding for the last candy type
[2:04:56] <deviljhojho94> Is pokemon lets go even good?
[2:05:01] <deviljhojho94> havent played it
[2:05:03] <%Keyd00d> Just waiting for next year's mainline
[2:05:03] <+zcrawford2> I thought I would hate it, but I don't know if I can go back now.
[2:05:03] <%Laecerelius> They do have the huge addition of being able to see random pokemon on the map so you can avoid them
[2:05:09] <dekkitout> its not unplayable, so theres that
[2:05:10] <admiralsatan> keep to the back right pat
[2:05:11] <%Big_Dream> for little kids sure good fmaliy game
[2:05:11] <Credfield_> @deviljhojho94 yes
[2:05:12] <+LogothX> Mega Venusaur with no Thick Fat = RIP
[2:05:14] <TheBlankAce> I was shitting on it at first but honestly the let's go games are pretty good, its actually fun to grind.
[2:05:14] <+sogeki_dan> I can't hear your better in all ways half, turn the game down!
[2:05:15] <%Aitch971> Its actually so damn fun though
[2:05:16] <Flyrant> shocker "Let's GO" pokemon games are based off of pokemon go
[2:05:21] <+Ssaik> why it gotta be like this
[2:05:22] <$Mornaka> @deviljhojho94 it's a nice game to relax with
[2:05:23] <captainthunderwolf> @deviljhojho94 I see we've got a fellow patrician in chat. I go for the Elite Riot Gear from the Lonesome Road DLC, because I get my rocks off by shooting dudes while looking like trenchcoat Darth Vader.
[2:05:26] <$awsomesaucekirby> @deviljhojho94 it's a bridge game to get the GOers into the main series
[2:05:31] <Jontman42> Pummel that femboy with your big hammer
[2:05:31] <+NWR_James> you shall not advance
[2:05:32] <Worldbrand> this is one of like two bosses in the game where magic shield is great
[2:05:34] <TheMilhouseExperience> I heard it was Baby's first RPG made even moreso for babies.
[2:05:34] <%forevern2dust> HE HATES IT
[2:05:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> he HATES IT
[2:05:36] <bleugh> eeverebody polkamon
[2:05:37] <deviljhojho94> @Credfield_ @Mornaka @awsomesaucekirby Perhaps i should give it a shot
[2:05:37] <faegbeard> stop greed drink big
[2:05:38] <%Divryne> Pat hates it.

[2:05:44] <SulfurousAcid> one weird trick
[2:05:45] <admiralsatan> BACK RIGHT
[2:05:47] <%DrFacilier> Does anyone else agree this game had the best soundtrack overall?
[2:05:49] <+LogothX> I hope the next pokemon game mixes things up a lot
[2:05:50] <grayjammer> I mean, the actual worst move in the game is the Ringed City Welcoming Comittee, but go off, i guess
[2:05:51] <OwlLightningMage> Ulysses is the best Fallout character ever
[2:05:52] <CheekyBirb> fuyukai
[2:05:56] <+barkon345> iwould be a good game if the fact that gaining experience from just catching pokemon without fighting didnt compleatley break the game
[2:06:00] <valdorick> This boss is the worst, he either dies stupid easy, or wastes you 20 times for no fuck'n reason. There is no inbetween
[2:06:01] <Flyrant> no DS1 had the best soundtrack
[2:06:11] <SuperMintSoda> Prisilla got Aldritched too
[2:06:11] <$Mornaka> @deviljhojho94 i'd say wait for it to go on sale but it's a nintendo game
[2:06:12] <+jaggiesama> Pokeeman zoomer edition
[2:06:14] <dekkitout> uh no, harold is the best fallout character Kappa
[2:06:15] <+Ssaik> D:
[2:06:15] <deviljhojho94> @captainthunderwolf My fucking man, By the time I reach hoover dam the only things in my inventory are the medicine gun, 2 revolvers and the elite riot/Independent coat

[2:06:19] <%MaiHusbando9S> goo biiiiiitch
[2:06:20] <captainthunderwolf> @OwlLightningMage Ulysses is great, because he's kind right. Fuck everyone, blow it up, blow me up, whatever.
[2:06:20] <$Yum438> Is this just the O&S boss room?
[2:06:20] <%forevern2dust> goo bitch
[2:06:22] <Caidezes> GOO BITCH

[2:06:23] <%Remery_> RUDE
[2:06:24] <Credfield_> @deviljhojho94 being able to see the pokemon in the wild is actually a blesssing, I'm farming for defense candies and I can see where the pokemon are and the shinys without going into everyone
[2:06:27] <%DuffMacwhalen> PAT TALK BIG SHIT

[2:06:29] <SailingSaturn> Body Shaming D:
[2:06:30] <%topendbuzz> @AngriestPat that is a bad take, fighting wilds in pokemon is a waste of time and is boring.

[2:06:53] <$luckypineapple> I know its a meme at this point and all that, but like, most DS3 fights are literal DPS races, the damage output on the bosses is stupid
[2:06:54] <deviljhojho94> @Credfield_ Fuck you can see the shinies? That's a gamechanger

[2:07:45] <Credfield_> @deviljhojho94 yeah I have three shiny gyrados. two shiny charizards, a shiny chancy and a few others

[2:08:06] <Parapattern> Saw a hollow in half with a laser
[2:08:07] <$awsomesaucekirby> remeber to use sound effects to open the chest pat!
[2:08:08] <kazadog> @luckypineapple no because if they kill you super quick then you need to learn how to mitigate damage not get more, have you even fought midir before?
[2:08:09] <Tampaoster> big booty bitch

[2:08:10] <deviljhojho94> @Credfield_ Fuck that's good. Im getting on sale, fuck it

[2:08:12] <CheekyBirb> default dancer of boreal valley
[2:08:13] <Credfield_> @deviljhojho94 and they are super rare even with maxing out stuff but you can get the legendary birds to spawn after finishing the game
[2:08:15] <nepwar> the mace of dandruff is too powerful. it has no weakness
[2:08:17] <moogleboy1984> @HyperBomb21 So, Uchi being the goal I assume?
[2:08:17] <Flyrant> 2 whole hours!
[2:08:19] <Kalcom> what
[2:08:21] <Worldbrand> I gotta agree that even though you can turn nearly every fight into a DPS race in this game, it's neither encouraged or intuitive, especially coming from DS1/2
[2:08:23] <ArcticAsylum> Shield of Want
[2:08:27] <Palidanjani> Sounds like u need more Luck Kappa
[2:08:29] <Credfield_> @deviljhojho94 I have a shiny Moltress
[2:08:32] <captainthunderwolf> @OwlLightningMage His incredibly deep voice is pretty good, too. And the whole "superboss Deathclaw whose weapon is a Hokuto no Ken reference" thing is pretty good. With the Wild Wasteland perk, if you kill Rawr and make his unique gauntlet, it's named Fist of The North Rawr.
[2:08:32] <nepwar> !uptime
[2:08:32] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 8m 34s.
[2:08:42] <SuperMintSoda> spend souls pat
[2:08:43] <deviljhojho94> @Credfield_ Shiny mewtwo is possible?
[2:08:45] <Worldbrand> Though maybe my point doesnt hold up considering bloodborne
[2:08:50] <Prism_Wing> Shield of What?? Kappa
[2:08:51] <Coystick> It's weakness is shampoo
[2:08:52] <+jaggiesama> DO YOU GUYS REMEMBER ALIEN

[2:09:03] <deviljhojho94> ii member
[2:09:03] <HyperBomb21> @moogleboy1984 I dunno. I'm not a fan of Katanas in general. Depends on what build you want
[2:09:04] <Flyrant> Bloodborne is the best souls game
[2:09:04] <Make_me_mad> Live action cowboy bebop coming to Netflix? I didn't want this...
[2:09:05] <$awsomesaucekirby> The mace of dandruf may give you itchy balls
[2:09:09] <HyperBomb21> For later on I mean
[2:09:12] <$luckypineapple> its basically impossible to be overlevelled in this game because once you get to this part of the game everything can kill you in three or so hits. Like, this game is copy paste of other areas from better game, I just wish it copied the good balance
[2:09:17] <Credfield_> @deviljhojho94 Not sure, I only know of the one mewtwo is Celdadon Cave after the main story I think I've seen it shiny
[2:09:21] <+jorgamund> @Make_me_mad God is punishing us
[2:09:23] <+Spryman> Pat use a coin?
[2:09:25] <Piiavc> but
[2:09:26] <$vectorcannonready> I got a shiny vulpix. So happy.
[2:09:29] <dekkitout> mewtwo is not shiny locked
[2:09:30] <JaydenSai> Desire Sensor
[2:09:30] <Piiavc> but the drakeblood set
[2:09:32] <+eldritchbee> Pat just get the drakeblood set
[2:09:33] <Piiavc> is in the gam
[2:09:35] <HyperBomb21> Why not just get the actual Drakeblod set?
[2:09:38] <Josef_Stryker> Can'ut u just buy the Lothric Arnour?

[2:09:40] <deviljhojho94> @Credfield_ @dekkitout oh sweet

[2:09:43] <Tampaoster> you can summon the old katana master to the dancer, it would be nice

[2:09:56] <+eldritchbee> Kill the drakeblood knight and go to where you find the dragon gesture
[2:09:56] <nepwar> so will steve buselmo every been hung up on the wall or will he always be disapproving of the stream on the floor
[2:09:57] <captainthunderwolf> Jim Sterling just rants about his shiny Ekans for about five minutes in his Pokemon Let's Go video.
[2:10:00] <%s_xylocalsingles> @AngriestPat archdragon peak, do the pose at the thing

[2:10:59] <Coystick> Game is pleasantly surprisingly active
[2:11:00] <FracturedImage> ezpz
[2:11:03] <captainthunderwolf> @OwlLightningMage Yeah, as deviljhojho and I discussed, I'm a revolver boy. I never had any use for it, but I appreciated that it existed.

[2:11:16] <RogueKnightXIII> J U S T I C E
[2:11:18] <+jorgamund> did the camera just second guess itself there
[2:11:19] <CheekyBirb> i believe it was on sale for autumn too?
[2:11:20] <Palidanjani> My Job Here Is Done dot jpeg
[2:11:21] <Kalcom> that and cause ds remastered is fuck
[2:11:22] <DracaenaLeaf> not dark souls 1 remastered?
[2:11:24] <Credfield_> @deviljhojho94 if you turn on your other joycon you can make almost any fight a 2v1 including Elite Four with the 2nd joycon using your 2nd party member
[2:11:26] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> The latest entry is Spyro though @AngriestPat
[2:11:27] <%Divryne> Pat HATES it.
[2:11:33] <TheMilhouseExperience> Wait did people abandon DS1 remaster?
[2:11:35] <SuperMintSoda> remastered kinda sucked
[2:11:44] <%forevern2dust> ^
[2:11:48] <%DrFacilier> i Forgot the remastered came out
[2:11:51] <CheekyBirb> @TheMilhouseExperience dsr is pretty dead online
[2:11:51] <thebehatted> I think Greyrat has it
[2:11:53] <Coystick> God I want Plague to draw Spyro girls
[2:11:55] <HyperBomb21> Remaster is a waste on PC
[2:11:55] <thebehatted> Greirat
[2:11:57] <crusader_heide> Pats Salty Johns
[2:11:57] <+Cervantas> Not sure why people hated on remaster, it was fine
[2:12:00] <Flyrant> remastered wasn't even really a remaster
[2:12:01] <cerberuscarmine> the dark souls of dragon games
[2:12:01] <Tampaoster> YESH
[2:12:04] <nepwar> can't wait till the dlc where sypro visits Dragon's peak
[2:12:04] <moogleboy1984> ballchinian helm
[2:12:04] <Yummy_Nukes> BIG boy pants
[2:12:05] <%around_40_jobbers> I wish Dark Souls had direction
[2:12:06] <+Promessa_EX> I 120% the first one
[2:12:09] <deviljhojho94> @Credfield_ That's interesting, does that mechanic serve a purpose or is it just for funsies?
[2:12:10] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> i fucking hate Xanthous so much.
[2:12:12] <Tampaoster> SMOUGH'S BEST set in the game
[2:12:15] <Aydarkzero> in Spyro remastered you play as the dragon!
[2:12:16] <CheekyBirb> i think remastered is mostly active on switch atm
[2:12:18] <+Promessa_EX> had fun
[2:12:21] <OwlLightningMage> @captainthunderwolf I was always a fan of the 50 cal sniper rifle. I never went anywhere without it. The revolvers in that are great though.
[2:12:21] <jojoagain> hi pat
[2:12:21] <HyperBomb21> Remaster is an inferior version of the game compared to Prepare to Die Edition
[2:12:22] <Flyrant> you have to actually remaster a game to call it remastered
[2:12:25] <captainthunderwolf> @pleasenameyourcharacter I like Xanthous BECAUSE it's bad.
[2:12:26] <TheBlankAce> Netflix just announced a live action cowboy bebop, this is true
[2:12:27] <+LogothX> I cant wait for Sekiro. A souls game with no level scumming
[2:12:41] <+Cervantas> Remaster is basically the same to me
[2:12:45] <deviljhojho94> @OwlLightningMage custom .50 is an act of god, not a weapon
[2:12:46] <+LogothX> Everything is polished and balanced around the tools you have
[2:12:52] <moogleboy1984> Shinichiro Watanabe is "consulting" on it
[2:12:53] <nepwar> man when will developer have the balls to remaster games that are terrible
[2:12:54] <Kayjeld> Black Spike confirmed
[2:12:54] <Credfield_> @deviljhojho94 the second joycon plays into co-op, they get their own character to move around with when not in battles and they control your 2nd pokemon
[2:13:00] <OwlLightningMage> It's so strong Kreygasm
[2:13:05] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> @captainthunderwolf and I can totally live with that. i just think it's a callback that outstayed it's welcome.
[2:13:06] <SuperMintSoda> Bloodborne 2 coming soon
[2:13:07] <Nepsotic> remastered on switch is currently being fucked by darkbead spammers and gank shitters
[2:13:10] <goddamndavid> isnt armor in DS3 like armor in BB in that different pieces have minimal effect on defense and mostly matters that you're just wearing it
[2:13:11] <Nepsotic> so the usual
[2:13:13] <+Promessa_EX> Ildris ilba as spike spiegel
[2:13:14] <+LogothX> Omikron The Nomad Soul: Remastered Koopy Edition

[2:13:26] <moogleboy1984> Idris as Jet please
[2:13:27] <captainthunderwolf> @OwlLightningMage Yeah, the Anti-Materiel Rifle? That was my go-to for Deathclaw fights for most of the game. Made killing them in the early mid-game actually somewhat bearable if you went straight to the Brotherhood and bought the shittiest one in the store to patch it up.
[2:13:28] <HyperBomb21> @Nepsotic It's almost like DS1 has terrible PvP
[2:13:29] <deviljhojho94> @Credfield_ Hmmm, I suposse I could teach my little brother how to play pokemon
[2:13:33] <Kayjeld> @Promessa_EX That would NEVER happen, Idris Elba is a man.

[2:13:42] <$awsomesaucekirby> I pray to the non existent gods that netflix grabbing evangalion doesn't catch and corrupt more of our youth
[2:13:51] <Blank9> maiden chest piece is legit great because it's a poncho
[2:13:52] <Nepsotic> @hyperbomb21 it's almost like all the souls games have terrible PvP
[2:13:53] <+Cervantas> Whats to corrupt
[2:13:54] <deviljhojho94> its too late for our youth
[2:13:55] <CurrySauseBandit> @goddamndavid Kinda, so long as you have a full set of armor on you're good to go mostly. But it can make a difference, as opposed to BB.
[2:13:55] <deviljhojho94> embrace it
[2:13:57] <Flyrant> Evangelion is trash anyway
[2:13:57] <CheekyBirb> @Nepsotic wasn't darkbead spammer always a thing?
[2:13:57] <+AXL808> Tarcatiel?

[2:15:00] <deviljhojho94> i can already see it monkaS
[2:15:05] <Nepsotic> @around_40_jobbers You need to have armor equipped in every slot if you want any defense at all
[2:15:06] <captainthunderwolf> @dekkitout To be fair, that was Anno's express design. He's gone on record saying that his overarching goal was to make viewers uncomfortable firstly.
[2:15:07] <%forevern2dust> Lucatiel is ugly.
[2:15:08] <moogleboy1984> man, that reminds me... I miss AMVs
[2:15:08] <+Spark_Man> Sup y'all. How's it going?

[2:15:28] <Credfield_> @deviljhojho94 you can "take pokemon out of ball" which means they follow you around, 1st player is optional, 2nd is always where it can, a lot of pokemon will carry you or some variant, my machamp has been carrying me (literally) for ages, he has a movement speed buff
[2:15:29] <$awsomesaucekirby> when a community ruins a work for the creator, it's the biggest sin. If you get angry at smash fans for what they did to sakurai, you're obligated to hate evangalion fans too
[2:15:36] <Flyrant> Lucatiel was the only interesting character in DS 2
[2:15:36] <captainthunderwolf> That's a lot of asses.
[2:15:37] <EMP_Ike_Turner> So many DBZ Linkin Park AMVs
[2:15:39] <nepwar> thats a lotta ass
[2:15:45] <OwlLightningMage> Lucatiel was a highlight for DS2. I hope Paige likes her
[2:15:47] <%around_40_jobbers> @Nepsotic Oh trust me I'm aware, I remember when I first discovered that after getting obliterated for not having a helmet
[2:15:48] <moogleboy1984> what's with the Raichu ass?

[2:19:12] <Headless_Sangheili> Ah farming for lothric armor, such sweet agony.
[2:19:12] <Tampaoster> and the teeth are human fingers
[2:19:13] <SulfurousAcid> yeah

[2:19:19] <CheekyBirb> yeah paige got it in ds1 in sen's fortress
[2:19:19] <+king_wragles> Ya, you told Woolie about how to get it
[2:19:25] <$awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 when a community ruins a work for the creator, it is one of the greatest sins. If you hate the smash community for what theyve done and continue to to to sakurai, you're obligated to hate Evangalion fans. Hate bebop for other reasons.
[2:19:26] <SailingSaturn> does it damage you in DS1?
[2:19:28] <+Verdenfert> each mimic in ds1 has a chance to drop it
[2:19:30] <faegbeard> knight say kno
[2:19:31] <+levitheshark> That's right, Happy Hob uses it in DS1 to setup RTSR

[2:20:00] <nepwar> local man denied to dress his dolls the way he wants
[2:20:00] <CheekyBirb> coin only last like a minute or something
[2:20:01] <@Mechz71> IT'S A TEMPORARY BUFF
[2:20:02] <ArcanumMBD> rezoning resets the coin
[2:20:04] <Flyrant> why not kill dancer first and get her bonfire, it be do faster
[2:20:06] <OwlLightningMage> One more time Pat. For sure this time kappa
[2:20:06] <admiralsatan> use all of the dolls
[2:20:08] <Jontman42> I don't think he even waited long enough for the items to spawn
[2:20:08] <SirDogBear> maybe it doesn't drop because you keep killing them by smashing in their chests CorgiDerp
[2:20:10] <BlacSoul> Warframe has desire sensor tech too so not too far off
[2:20:10] <+AXL808> i think the coin lasts for a minute or so
[2:20:12] <captainthunderwolf> @OwlLightningMage I could get a lot of things if I called all of everything in a game, alright, but a man only has so much murder.
[2:20:16] <SailingSaturn> @TheMilhouseExperience weird I used that piece but I forgot the hp drain
[2:20:19] <ArcanumMBD> put it on your item bar
[2:20:38] <bsmusic> coin only lasts like 20secs i think
[2:20:38] <+reposted_darksouls_salt> What‚Äôs he trying to farm
[2:20:41] <Tampaoster> yes
[2:20:42] <$Mornaka> i think so?
[2:20:42] <benjiFG> buy the normal ones from patches
[2:20:45] <%RedMaskBandit> Yup
[2:20:45] <cizal11> coin only lasts 5 seconds
[2:20:45] <bsmusic> patches
[2:20:46] <captainthunderwolf> @awsomesaucekirby You mean Scooter? I've played the Borderlands games since 1 came out, and I thought the satellite was actually a nice tough.
[2:20:46] <Yummy_Nukes> can't tell which is more ridiculous, that or your space ninja hats
[2:20:48] <Nepsotic> been trying to invade since the demon ruins - definitely useless
[2:20:50] <eco419> from Patches
[2:20:51] <Flyrant> coin lasts 0 seconds
[2:20:52] <CheekyBirb> gold coins are limited sales
[2:20:52] <Seraphile> question is the warframe later a lie
[2:20:57] <OwlLightningMage> Pat will get it this time Kappa
[2:21:01] <+AXL808> i think you can buy normal coins but the luckier ones, no
[2:21:03] <+TimberWulfe> I look away for 1 minute, and Pat equips a lootbox helmet
[2:21:04] <@Mechz71> he's trying to farm deez nutz right now
[2:21:04] <OwlLightningMage> For sure this time Kappa

[2:21:07] <deviljhojho94> This time IT WILL BE DIFFERENT
[2:21:08] <$Mornaka> coin is gone 3 seconds before you uise it
[2:21:13] <deviljhojho94> CRazy talk?
[2:21:15] <%TaifuDragon> What's he looking for?
[2:21:19] <+king_wragles> I believe!
[2:21:21] <+ajcritfumble> god cathedral knight farm was rough but super worth it
[2:21:21] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> What the unholy hell did i just find in my bag of wings? I thought it said "boneless wings" not "umbilical cord."
[2:21:21] <nepwar> no but this time he will
[2:21:23] <HyperBomb21> If you can stomach farming for 30 Concords, Faith builds in DS3 are best builds in the game imo
[2:21:23] <dekkitout> did the pat ever get that axe from way back when
[2:21:24] <SulfurousAcid> chest
[2:21:25] <deviljhojho94> what the fuckk

[2:21:36] <SirDogBear> coin will last as long as you keep making payments
[2:21:36] <%Illucination> @AngriestPat If you want more item discovery to help farm, Crystal Sage's Rapier increases it as well.
[2:21:39] <SulfurousAcid> give pat chest
[2:21:42] <katocrimson> amazing chest
[2:21:43] <TheEnablerr> 30 leggings = no chest
[2:21:43] <$Mendin> Jesus Pat if you find and hit my red sign soapstone here I'll GIVE you that armor

[2:21:55] <OwlLightningMage> He wants the chest. It's all he needs to complete the set
[2:21:59] <nepwar> maybe you should wear the lothric set for good luck
[2:22:00] <+reposted_darksouls_salt> Why that chest piece anyway it looks ugly DansGame
[2:22:01] <HyperBomb21> @Jammho Dancer isnt dead yet
[2:22:05] <admiralsatan> TRY DABBING
[2:22:07] <$Mornaka> @Jammho has't killed her yet

[2:23:00] <BlitzChocula> I knew there had to be a cost for Evangelion hitting Netflix. A price to pay. Damn this timeline.
[2:23:01] <Kalcom> become greed
[2:23:01] <katocrimson> netflix is trying to kill every anime francise with live action.
[2:23:03] <Headless_Sangheili> It could be like firefly, or it could be trash.
[2:23:06] <TheBlankAce> They had ton announce Eva the day before to soften the blow
[2:23:06] <Nepsotic> @arcanummbd Cheers dude
[2:23:06] <+AXL808> so you just squeeze the gold coin into your body?

[2:23:36] <HyperBomb21> @AngriestPat Welcome to the feeling of concord farming for DarkMoon Blade buff
[2:23:37] <+Salvation122> Also Keanu Reeves is now probably too old to play Spike so meh
[2:23:38] <SailingSaturn> Greed Sensor cirTan
[2:23:40] <admiralsatan> just keep trying
[2:23:42] <%Hilleltaco> It's the desire sensor

[2:23:51] <faegbeard> does too much item discovery bug out and wrap back around?

[2:23:53] <admiralsatan> BECOME HUGE
[2:23:57] <+Dovakhin573> I VOTE KEANU REEVES AS SPIKE
[2:24:00] <TsunTsuchinoko> I heard item drops often seem to have tiers for rarity, like having too much item find can make it harder to get some drops
[2:24:01] <captainthunderwolf> @deviljhojho94 Don't worry, they'll ruin Ed's ambiguous gender thing by choosing a single pronoun, and ruin Ed's design with an awful wig.
[2:24:01] <TheEnablerr> Who the FUCK at Netflix is going "I wan't make ALL the anime live action! ANIME IS REAL!"

[2:24:58] <limeyprick> Refined Gem? Lothric Knight Sword?
[2:25:02] <benjiFG> they drop lothric's ashes
[2:25:03] <+Nobrev> pay attention chat he keeps saying he wants the lothric knight chestpiece
[2:25:05] <SuperMintSoda> THIS TIME THOUGH
[2:25:05] <OwlLightningMage> THIS IS THE DEEP
[2:25:06] <dekkitout> little did we know, lothric knights go into battle shirtless
[2:25:08] <crusader_heide> Let us drop it 4 you!
[2:25:11] <+metalsiren31> If it's the chest yeah, definitely
[2:25:12] <HyperBomb21> The desire sensor is real
[2:25:13] <bsmusic> maybe its the lothric Castle ones?
[2:25:14] <ArcanumMBD> just get 99 humanity to boost your drop rate, obviously
[2:25:15] <IShadowStrykerI> pat, verbally admit defeat and it will be dropped quick
[2:25:16] <+Instagig> Why does he want it
[2:25:17] <moogleboy1984> except the chest
[2:25:18] <Caidezes> @AngriestPat Try the one by where the dragon was.
[2:25:18] <%forevern2dust> apatWink pet the elmo for good luck and you'll get it

[2:25:31] <captainthunderwolf> @Mornaka You just forced me to realize that "chesdt" and "chest" have nearly identical pronunciation.
[2:25:34] <admiralsatan> Eventually you will stop failing
[2:25:36] <101shadesofwonderful> Time to pour all your levels into luck.
[2:25:38] <+Nobrev> @AngriestPat iirc if you boost your item discovery too high it actually makes it more dificult to get high drop rate items

[2:26:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> IT DOESNT EVEN LOOK GOOD
[2:26:26] <captainthunderwolf> @Dovakhin573 The black guy playing Butler in the Artemis Fowl movie.
[2:26:30] <awsomesaucekirby> @CheekyBirb well that sucks
[2:26:30] <OwlLightningMage> Ed has to be Ryan Reynolds
[2:26:31] <SuperMintSoda> fat roll is for pros
[2:26:31] <Latch77> the drop rates for the lothric knigth is actually pretty low
[2:26:32] <+Dovakhin573> LOL

[2:26:33] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Aren‚Äôt you a little short to be a Lothric knight
[2:26:33] <+LogothX> Its because of the torn cape

[2:26:46] <TheMilhouseExperience> They're probably going to turn Ed into a blue hair hipster chick.
[2:26:50] <+gael_jebidibah> Cape also doesn't clip as bad

[2:33:35] <moogleboy1984> This is the video that made me love Austin from The SCIENCE

[2:34:26] <+LogothX> Dancer is a very Plague of Gripes boss
[2:34:29] <$Piemono> Is it weird that she's an Heir of Fire?
[2:34:29] <+AXL808> Dancer's swords are one of my favorite weapons
[2:34:31] <SwindlerOfProgress> Good job, vitality.
[2:34:34] <SirDogBear> tarkus doesnt need to block

[2:35:06] <+Noxybaru> Are we human or are we Dancer
[2:35:08] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 smash games are getting banned for 100 years. magpies are a shorthand for the Blood Ravens chapter, they like to steal stuff, and /tg likes to call them "space gypsies"
[2:35:09] <captainthunderwolf> @admiralsatan You don't that she's not a snake under there, she totally could be.
[2:35:09] <grayjammer> U gonna use the Winged Knight set? @AngriestPat
[2:35:11] <%Zael913> Dancer thicc AF
[2:35:20] <cerberuscarmine> intense
[2:35:25] <moogleboy1984> Dancer needs at least 6 more tits and a mischievous little fang for it to be Plague-like
[2:35:25] <$Mornaka> @EMP_Ike_Turner like i want to live to have it happen again
[2:35:26] <admiralsatan> I

[2:35:59] <Tucker0603> THEIR SET IS MY FAVORITE
[2:36:01] <captainthunderwolf> That having been said, the way the Dancer walks like an old anime grandma is fucking ridiculous.

[2:36:09] <grayjammer> @SuperMintSoda Ah, I See You Are A Man Of Taste As Well
[2:36:11] <valdorick> He tried to poise fight Tarkus, but Tarkus always wins poise fights
[2:36:14] <Grimlockfly> So huge
[2:36:17] <OwlLightningMage> I'm setting fire to a church if Carrot doesn't join the crew
[2:36:19] <Flyrant> @Kayjeld own him super hard
[2:36:20] <captainthunderwolf> @Kayjeld He won't hunger for victory unless he tastes defeat first.

[2:37:47] <OwlLightningMage> Everything Carrot does is great
[2:37:49] <admiralsatan> oh no
[2:37:49] <%Zael913> @DonatelloJose Clemps would bone anything that has bunny ears and tail
[2:37:51] <grayjammer> Oceiros is probably my favourite character in the entire game
[2:37:51] <OwlLightningMage> Carrot is love
[2:37:56] <@Mechz71> GREAT MACE
[2:37:58] <TheMilhouseExperience> I just remembered this area from the LP. This is going very well.

[2:38:09] <limeyprick> cathedral knight set is an annoying farm
[2:38:10] <Coystick> >Pat loves the zone crawling with the worst enemies in the game
[2:38:13] <OwlLightningMage> Good job Mace
[2:38:17] <captainthunderwolf> Oceiros and his creepy baby are one of the weirdest bits of cut content.
[2:38:21] <cizal11> lmfao
[2:38:25] <Kayjeld> @Flyrant The moment I get my hands on a gun I'm shooting this kid into a time paradox.
[2:38:27] <SuperMintSoda> I'm sad there isn't a blue cathedral set

[2:38:56] <skelton_man> @angriestpat I have a question I have no clue about dark souls who is tarkus
[2:38:57] <awsomesaucekirby> DIE CHAOS SPAWN!
[2:39:12] <captainthunderwolf> Fun fact, chat, Lady Maria in Blodborne has entire unwatchable cutscenes you've never seen because From patched the over with event triggers without actually removing the content.
[2:39:13] <Coystick> Die Manus sperm!
[2:39:18] <@Mechz71> why do these enemies have the Wesker juice in theme
[2:39:19] <awsomesaucekirby> @skelton_man youtube it big sbfp meme
[2:39:21] <%Zael913> FOR DAH EMPRAH
[2:39:21] <eco419> good job armor
[2:39:23] <$Mendin> Black Iron TARKUS TARKUS TARKUS TARKUS is one of the biggest and strongest
[2:39:29] <dekkitout> tarkus is typically summed up as 'Dat Boi'
[2:39:34] <captainthunderwolf> @Mechz71 RIP Pus of Man
[2:39:35] <$Mendin> the Fat Black Evil?
[2:39:42] <eggsnbakefest> Go look up "Sbfp Tarkus"
[2:39:42] <%BrazenMask> Human Pine Resin makes me uncomfortable
[2:39:46] <eggsnbakefest> Or something like that
[2:39:57] <captainthunderwolf> @BrazenMask That's probably because it fucking should.
[2:40:06] <cizal11> jesus. just fuckin chumped him
[2:40:10] <eco419> Delicious human resin mmmmhh
[2:40:13] <TheMilhouseExperience> Tarkus just does a T pose and it creates a death field around him.
[2:40:14] <OwlLightningMage> Rub liquid person on mah sword
[2:40:18] <dekkitout> its just people wax, nbd
[2:40:21] <%BrazenMask> im usually pretty good with that stuff though
[2:40:23] <SuperMintSoda> it's made from real babies
[2:40:31] <%BrazenMask> its probably because it looks so gloppy
[2:40:31] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> fuck, i need to watch Happy Souls again...
[2:40:33] <+AXL808> i'm a little bit disappointed about Ocerios because pretty much everything about him is stuffed into this corner of the level as an optional boss/character
[2:40:35] <@Mechz71> pat you are poisoned
[2:40:35] <faegbeard> but muh buff
[2:40:37] <$WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> Optimize Your Resin and Face To Bloodshed
[2:40:38] <Bouldus> dont tell me what to do
[2:40:39] <awsomesaucekirby> Pine resin me daddy
[2:40:39] <$Mornaka> But i neeeeed it Pat
[2:40:45] <%Zael913> @pleasenameyourcharacter That video is great
[2:40:52] <+LogothX> What if you just use babies?
[2:40:53] <%NovaKnightmare> Cockwood
[2:40:54] <eco419> but Pat is so Tasty
[2:40:58] <Yummy_Nukes> people pine pitch gud fer burnin'
[2:41:01] <SuperMintSoda> no humans were injured in the making of this pine resin
[2:41:01] <Kayjeld> Pat, couldn't you have said that a bit earlier?
[2:41:01] <+LogothX> Remember when those Sailor Moon villains wanted to harvest baby energy?
[2:41:05] <OwlLightningMage> The kid brains make the best resin
[2:41:13] <grayjammer> "No, no; 'Oss-Er-Lotte'" "A h , Y o u A r e I g n o r a n t S l a v e ?"
[2:41:13] <+ajcritfumble> i hear that guy cant even die right
[2:41:14] <captainthunderwolf> @AXL808 The cut content implies that he totally had a weird undead dragon baby and was actively making dragon people, but you showed up in the nick of time to fuck his life up out of spite.
[2:41:15] <Flyrant> how would you even make human resin? It's a natural secretion of plants... unless it's just piss
[2:41:24] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> @zael913 even people i show it to who don't play dark souls love it
[2:41:24] <DonatelloJose> @pleasenameyourcharacter the song from that video is the background noise of my mind.
[2:41:27] <dekkitout> just use the al-bheds to make pine resin, sure itd be low quality, but pine resin ya k now bruddah
[2:41:31] <TheEnablerr> Human Pine Resin. Yeah let me just slather this old man goo on my sword
[2:41:36] <cizal11> don't you actually want to open that shortcut first
[2:41:43] <%Zael913> @pleasenameyourcharacter I'm gonna go watch it again in fact....
[2:41:44] <captainthunderwolf> @Flyrant It's literally, like, sticky decayed human that's still a little bit alive.
[2:41:44] <$Mornaka> @Flyrant you could make a tar from human fat probably?

[2:42:17] <SirDogBear> tarkus lost BibleThump
[2:42:19] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> That guy was POISED for victory
[2:42:20] <%around_40_jobbers> remember when poise was fake?
[2:42:20] <SuperMintSoda> 5'10 vs 6 foot
[2:42:22] <tysmiller> that man is POISEonnn
[2:42:25] <+Chud_Pudsley> You got berserked
[2:42:28] <copicmario> that weopan real good get with rat ashes
[2:42:31] <$luckypineapple> 4 hits = death, yep that Dark Souls 3 DPS
[2:42:31] <Yummy_Nukes> should've smashed him harder pat
[2:42:31] <EMP_Ike_Turner> He is made of poise
[2:42:37] <grayjammer> Trading with a Cathedral Knight LUL
[2:42:42] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> @zael913 watch it several times. it stacks.
[2:42:42] <+Grayhammatter> knew that was prolly going to happen
[2:42:46] <TheEnablerr> Poise Incarnate
[2:42:46] <TheMilhouseExperience> Mistakes were made. Consequences have happened. People have moved on.
[2:42:55] <+averyoddjew> Working as intended
[2:42:56] <SuperMintSoda> "You mearly adopted the poise"
[2:42:56] <katocrimson> Did they ever fix poise in DS3? I haven't played since painted world dlc
[2:43:00] <awsomesaucekirby> I once had a conversatio with m bro about some people smoking weed in their cars, I said if they crash and die, it's survival of the fittest, he said " what about the kids in the car or pedestrians?" I said then the kids are from a failed gene source, and if the pedestrian couldn't dodge, then Survival of the fittest is still in effect
[2:43:14] <TheEnablerr> I AM poise
[2:43:18] <Flyrant> @katocrimson poise acts more like super armor when you swing
[2:43:25] <eco419> thats fuk
[2:43:25] <goddamndavid> @AngriestPat did you pay respects to Momma Mushroom?
[2:43:26] <+Chud_Pudsley> Which is honestly a bit bs
[2:43:30] <$WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> It's The LAW of the WILD
[2:43:30] <grayjammer> @katocrimson Yea they buffed Hevy Armour just before Ringed City
[2:43:32] <katocrimson> ah ok. good to know
[2:43:34] <CheekyBirb> poise also armors estus drinking
[2:43:39] <dekkitout> survival of the fittest is quite the slippery slope in the age of post pants
[2:43:41] <$luckypineapple> the way that poise works in DS3 is one of the dumbest things in the entire series
[2:43:41] <ArcanumMBD> i thought poise affected iframes at the end of a roll
[2:43:52] <SuperMintSoda> poise is turned off in the game files
[2:43:59] <Flyrant> poise in DS1 is honestly way dumber
[2:44:12] <Yummy_Nukes> it'll buff out
[2:44:14] <Gorgen> this stream was a mistake
[2:44:14] <eco419> crazy talk go
[2:44:15] <moogleboy1984> mistakes into miracles
[2:44:22] <IShadowStrykerI> so they nerfed my favorite build, fixed the blades of the darkmoon, and pseudo-fixed poise...i need to go back to ds3
[2:44:23] <captainthunderwolf> I like that black-and-gold templar design a lot, by the way.
[2:44:25] <CheekyBirb> pat so blind doodTess
[2:44:27] <captainthunderwolf> That enemy looks rad.
[2:44:28] <+hypergenn2> ooooh! we big thumpy mace boi now
[2:44:33] <grayjammer> The way that poise works in this game is actually better than in the previous games, yall are just salty its not busted anymore
[2:44:40] <Tampaoster> the sound you heard earlier was the divine buff not a c lizard
[2:44:43] <skelton_man> and I'm back from Google and tarkus is a bamf
[2:44:45] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> poise affects Hyper Armor on attacks without built in Hyper Armor
[2:44:48] <majindusto> Big Whoops
[2:44:48] <awsomesaucekirby> He said "What if I run you over?" I said "then I don't deserve to be in the gene pool if I couldn't evade, and you've done the world a service" (jokes on him, I don't belong in the gene pool anyway)
[2:44:49] <cizal11> yeah ds3's new poise is the best form of it in the series
[2:44:50] <Nepsotic> "Failed to invade" I am so sick of this cunting message
[2:44:51] <Flyrant> people upset they can't race roll as a giant dad tbh
[2:44:54] <SuperMintSoda> I'm salty a rat can nip my ankles and stun Havel the Rock
[2:44:57] <TheEnablerr> Where is it? Oh it's under this BRIGHT ASS LAMP
[2:44:59] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> since i've been rewatching the BB LP, i keep thinking, "why isn't he swinging to heal?"
[2:45:06] <+metalsiren31> DS1 poise is completely broken and anyone who says it isn't has never fought a curved sword in PVP
[2:45:08] <+roxikat> Did he get his souls back?
[2:45:12] <Inebriateddonut> Poise just doesn't make sense in 3 is all since it depends more on weapon than armor
[2:45:14] <$luckypineapple> I Like Lothric castle a lot, its a really cool original area. Makes me wish there was more areas like it and not just reskinned chalic dungeons
[2:45:18] <Nepsotic> rally system in bb sucks ass thats why
[2:45:21] <OwlLightningMage> if anyone doesn't know about Tarkus, go watch Woolie's introduction to Tarkus on the channel
[2:45:25] <awsomesaucekirby> @pleasenameyourcharacter OHHH boy
[2:45:27] <eco419> almost 5
[2:45:29] <Gorgen> Is THIS Anor londo?
[2:45:36] <Flyrant> Giant Dad and Havel Mom were just awful in DS1
[2:45:43] <+hypergenn2> is that MOFUGGIN TARKUS D:
[2:45:46] <Nepsotic> anar lando
[2:45:46] <OwlLightningMage> Not Paige's introduction to Tarkus though. That one went bad LUL
[2:45:47] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> @awsomesaucekirby yeah, it's weird
[2:45:50] <Yummy_Nukes> emancipate those slaves pat!
[2:45:56] <skelton_man> tarkus is so cool
[2:46:01] <dekkitout> hell yeah its de KUS-TAR
[2:46:03] <Tampaoster> is paige still alive?
[2:46:03] <thebehatted> when I see that buff now, all I can think of is those ds3 videos with U S E L E S S D A T A
[2:46:12] <DracaenaLeaf> candle head time?
[2:46:23] <OwlLightningMage> Tarkus doesn't like Paige. He hates the smell of McDonlads LUL
[2:46:25] <+AXL808> still laughing about the Royal Ladder
[2:46:29] <ArcanumMBD> poise in ds2 was also ass cause a 2h heavy attack from a straightsword could break 90% of poise breakpoints in 1 swing, and the remaining 10% in 2
[2:46:29] <$Mornaka> dip your head in the goo pat
[2:46:34] <SirDogBear> lothric castle was fun it had that demon souls vibe for me because you had to explore it in chunks in beginning and end
[2:46:37] <eco419> ih boy Limit Breakers are awesome
[2:46:42] <katocrimson> Champion gundyer
[2:46:44] <SuperMintSoda> Tarkus would totally drive his kids to McDonalds
[2:46:49] <+hypergenn2> i always liked the red glowing eye ring in DS2 and it would give you a red tracer light behind you when you ran, I would play Initial D music and try to speedrun things
[2:46:54] <+Grayhammatter> dragon dark boi
[2:46:57] <awsomesaucekirby> @pleasenameyourcharacter no, I mean because that series becomes named "snailborne" by the community. I've watched most of it, and I couldn't tell you what happend
[2:46:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> big boi
[2:47:00] <thebehatted> Limit Breakers is the shit
[2:47:01] <%around_40_jobbers> theres only 1 good thing about the library and it's the arbalast
[2:47:05] <thebehatted> love that guy
[2:47:06] <CheekyBirb> 29%
[2:47:07] <OwlLightningMage> Tarkus only eats Wendy's
[2:47:12] <+atin2000> @AngriestPat 29.9%
[2:47:16] <CheekyBirb> the speed of the roll is still the same, just longer ifreames
[2:47:17] <SuperMintSoda> 30% -70%
[2:47:19] <awsomesaucekirby> @pleasenameyourcharacter better off watching the solidus supercuts
[2:47:22] <Flyrant> Tarkus a man of culture only eats Del Taco
[2:47:25] <%claudesavegely> here we go
[2:47:27] <+metalsiren31> Under 30 for fast roll but fast roll is kind of useless compared to mid roll
[2:47:29] <$Mornaka> CHat, would you dip your head in a pool of mysterious white goo in a library?
[2:47:31] <$luckypineapple> Honestly the way that weight works in this series is so stupid. The best thing Bloodborne ever did was remove that shit
[2:47:31] <TalisKanju> So is that Buck Bumble stream really going to happen?
[2:47:36] <benjiFG> there's a faster roll?
[2:47:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yes
[2:47:41] <%FackinCrazy> Tarkus only eat Elise
[2:47:45] <awsomesaucekirby> LOVE this place

[2:47:55] <IShadowStrykerI> yeah this blades of the darkmoon shit is amazing...o more grinding the silver knights for 6 hours
[2:47:55] <TheEnablerr> @Mornaka you mean you wouldn't?

[2:51:49] <$luckypineapple> @Nepsotic I specifically said this part of the game, learn to read. Everything between Carthus and Dancer in this game is gold, everything before and after is the worst
[2:51:50] <CheekyBirb> oceiros voice has asuch a sweet and soothing voice
[2:51:51] <%patriotrenegade> IGNORANT SLAVES
[2:51:51] <ExemplarKyle> This ice weapon is nooot doing very much
[2:51:53] <thebehatted> OCELOOOOOOTTE
[2:51:53] <+Ssaik> D:
[2:51:54] <%thewinged7> OOOOCEEELOOOOOOTTTTT
[2:51:55] <dekkitout> that baby is the forgotten joestar
[2:51:58] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> @awsomesaucekirby the problem is i hate Star Wars, and don't enjoy hearing people beat the Mass Effect horse 6 years after it's dead. so i get nothing from it.
[2:51:58] <TheEnablerr> @cizal11 yeah but I mean those giant orange lined MMO ones
[2:51:59] <$Mornaka> he mad
[2:52:00] <ExemplarKyle> Phase 2 time!!!

[2:52:07] <BadLuckValentine> best part
[2:52:09] <+Nobrev> SNAAAKE
[2:52:12] <Coystick> He needed a flatter arena
[2:52:13] <+NeoJoker316> He's got some of the best voice lines
[2:52:14] <ExemplarKyle> LIQUIIIIIIID
[2:52:14] <%NovaKnightmare> ITS NOT OVER YET

[2:52:19] <$WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> That ROLL
[2:52:20] <+Ssaik> Blood-starved with a BULLSHIT charge attack
[2:52:20] <%NovaKnightmare> WE'RE NOT FINISHED YET
[2:52:24] <+Gorgodrn> Fun fact: in the early game screenshots, this arena was Iudex Gundyr's boss areana instead
[2:52:25] <grayjammer> I wish more characters in Dark Souls games were like Oceiros, but that's probebly detract from how cool he is
[2:52:25] <$ooblagis> Blood Starved is much easier
[2:52:25] <Gorgen> smack his ankles
[2:52:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol just walk left
[2:52:27] <Nepsotic> @luckypineapple sounds like you need to *git gud*
[2:52:28] <cizal11> that fucking charge
[2:52:31] <$luckypineapple> IF this was bloodstarved this would be a goodboss
[2:52:32] <+storkeylope> Yeyeyeyeye spike the baby child
[2:52:37] <Yummy_Nukes> BRRRROTHEEERRRRR
[2:52:38] <TalisKanju> Does Pat like the Pain from MGS3?
[2:52:39] <SuperMintSoda> Seath the babyless
[2:52:40] <tysmiller> what if lothric was just possessing revolver ocelotte's arm all along
[2:52:47] <$waltzqueen> i can just hear the bloodstarved sound effects
[2:52:48] <eco419> punch the baby
[2:52:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> NICE ENDING
[2:52:50] <benjiFG> ! BONKED !
[2:52:50] <$WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> WOW

[2:52:54] <+Ssaik> FATALITY
[2:52:54] <DracaenaLeaf> Nice
[2:52:54] <thebehatted> oh damn he just stops moving
[2:52:54] <awsomesaucekirby> Oceiros is either Joseph Joestar, The Boss, or The Sorrow
[2:52:55] <$WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> THAT FEELS GOOD
[2:52:57] <Coystick> Woah never seen that
[2:52:57] <TheGrimmHuntsman> Big Finish!
[2:52:58] <zamzoph> POP OUT LUL
[2:52:58] <%around_40_jobbers> what a cool guy but a terrible boss
[2:52:58] <ArcanumMBD> if there's anything we learn from Oceiros and Big Hat Logan, there are no consequences to trying to become a dragon
[2:52:59] <$waltzqueen> NICE
[2:53:00] <sponsoredviewer910> EZ
[2:53:01] <ape_hawk> he represents DEMENSIA
[2:53:01] <eco419> Yeyeyeyeeee
[2:53:01] <Nepsotic> fuck yeah instant overly punishing charge, wow such great design
[2:53:02] <dekkitout> so moral of a story; STOP TRYING TO TURN YOURSELF INTO A DRAGON- IT DOESNT WORK
[2:53:03] <CheekyBirb> he got deleted so hard he didn't even fade
[2:53:03] <%Divryne> THE BABY.
[2:53:04] <%forevern2dust> Oceiros's VA also voice Djura

[2:53:10] <crusader_heide> Gg
[2:53:10] <%xemnahort> great finish pat good job
[2:53:11] <+Gorgodrn> Doing that on Dancer is the best
[2:53:13] <101shadesofwonderful> You. Did it.
[2:53:15] <OwlLightningMage> I wonder what the champion Yhrom fight was going to be
[2:53:16] <$luckypineapple> @Nepsotic people like you are why they arent gonna do LPs of souls game anymore
[2:53:18] <+AXL808> i think we really missed out on even a neat, small story on the"child of dragons"
[2:53:18] <TheEnablerr> Dragon = bad idea
[2:53:19] <Haruhi_Sujioka> dragonkin btfo
[2:53:22] <ExemplarKyle> Oh hell. Champion Gundyr next. O_O
[2:53:24] <+Grayhammatter> you.... did it
[2:53:27] <awsomesaucekirby> "perfect"
[2:53:27] <+pleasenameyourcharacter> so... what's the deal with the baby?
[2:53:30] <SirDogBear> oceiros and mergo's wet nurse should tag team
[2:53:31] <Yummy_Nukes> ZERO DEATHS
[2:53:33] <CNExoSoul> it was the first second try @AngriestPat
[2:53:37] <majindusto> Pat shall become THE PAIN with all these BEES

[2:53:53] <OwlLightningMage> Champion Gundyr music Kreygasm
[2:53:54] <$luckypineapple> getting close to the fanfic fight

[2:54:08] <$Mornaka> What would Mergo and Ocelotte's kid look like
[2:54:09] <+AXL808> Soul of Oceirios: "Honeynut flavor"
[2:54:10] <ArcanumMBD> @pleasenameyourcharacter there's deleted audio of oceiros smashing (and eating? dont remember) the baby. And it's brutal. Dunno if there ever was a baby model. It's basically just a ghost baby
[2:54:11] <DracaenaLeaf> Wait was it? How many tries did the letsplay take?
[2:54:19] <SuperMintSoda> zombie deer

[2:54:38] <SulfurousAcid> sure you will
[2:54:46] <+AXL808> snek!
[2:54:48] <grayjammer> I prefer the idea that Ocelotte straight-up left years and years ago and Oceiros is just holding nothing
[2:54:54] <%around_40_jobbers> what a hero
[2:54:57] <Kalcom> hey we are in the past now

[3:10:42] <%NovaKnightmare> BRING BACK GOOD POISE
[3:10:47] <+karatepistolfist> remember when the black knights were scary in ds1? lol

[3:10:57] <%around_40_jobbers> bzzzz ring
[3:11:00] <Midnight188> I really hope Sekiro is actually good, I've got worries....
[3:11:00] <+Foobe> no way! new poise is good poise!
[3:11:01] <Nepsotic> black knights were easy as fuck in ds1 lol
[3:11:04] <awsomesaucekirby> Pat, we're so [PRULD] of you
[3:11:05] <moogleboy1984> Did Pat say he has The Troubles?
[3:11:06] <Nepsotic> parry for days
[3:11:08] <Zereaux> POISE-ON
[3:11:11] <Flyrant> Sekiro looks good
[3:11:15] <+CyberTheory> all you have to do is not let them hit you
[3:11:19] <$Mornaka> SO Pruld
[3:11:24] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat the item's in the gundyr arena
[3:11:29] <thebehatted> gnaah
[3:11:30] <xddddsorandom> Man did you rip off that guy at the store to get Sekiro early again Pat?
[3:11:30] <Midnight188> Pat has tiny irish terrorists inside of him? damn.
[3:11:31] <SulfurousAcid> very pruld
[3:11:34] <%NovaKnightmare> Pat, you gonna stream Sekiro when it comes out?
[3:11:35] <awsomesaucekirby> GNAAHH!!
[3:11:35] <benjiFG> was that artorias's grave
[3:11:37] <$rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat Pat what food from an anime made you the hungriest or made you want to try it the most?
[3:11:37] <%Kazooki_Kazami> what poise, this is ds3
[3:11:40] <TheChillRoom> I'm reasonably pruld. But I could be prulder.
[3:11:45] <%Kazooki_Kazami> you only have hyper armor
[3:11:46] <Midnight188> are they just his immune system?
[3:11:53] <Kalcom> reminder the old hag has special dialog if you never talk with her
[3:11:54] <TheMilhouseExperience> I hope Sekiro doesn't feel like the game is tearing itself into 3. But that's what I get for playing a magic swordsman build.
[3:11:57] <Nepsotic> poise affects hyperarmor
[3:11:59] <fahrazindo> Where is the baby?
[3:12:00] <cizal11> why does she sell homeward bones if you get an infinite one right there anyway
[3:12:00] <SuperMintSoda> if you kill her she comes back and doubles her prices
[3:12:02] <+FloorBurger> Best boi
[3:12:03] <awsomesaucekirby> to people who think it was a typo, google it
[3:12:05] <eco419> lol white soap
[3:12:17] <candidateplays> No, if you kill her here, she's dead for good here
[3:12:23] <%MagickBurritoh> Look at that purple armor
[3:12:23] <+karatepistolfist> how is she still alive
[3:12:24] <%Divryne> EYES ON THE INSIDE.
[3:12:24] <Midnight188> imagine if you killed her again she just doubled her prices again and it stacked forever.
[3:12:27] <Gorgen> gotta get that LARP costume though
[3:12:31] <Kalcom> this is the past
[3:12:38] <Midnight188> like these prism stones are 100k souls now
[3:12:38] <thebehatted> praise be to the italian stallion
[3:12:41] <Zereaux> you know the irony of the whole fate series is that the best fate show is the one where shiro just cooks shit
[3:12:42] <$Mornaka> EAT THOSE EYES FOR INSIGHT
[3:12:43] <Yummy_Nukes> do things because it's cool pat, buy it!
[3:12:46] <+Gorgodrn> THis is the past and she is undead
[3:12:56] <SuperMintSoda> Eye status: granted
[3:12:57] <Nepsotic> people acting like its actually explained
[3:13:03] <Midnight188> @Zereaux THIS GUY KNOWS WHATS UP!!!
[3:13:04] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat the item you missed is in the gundyr arena
[3:13:06] <%Divryne> Take off your clothes.
[3:13:07] <+Gorgodrn> It is explained
[3:13:08] <+Foobe> you definitely can
[3:13:09] <grayjammer> you can
[3:13:09] <+Noxybaru> You totally can actually there
[3:13:09] <%around_40_jobbers> Now to tell the fire keeper you have eyes for her
[3:13:10] <+karatepistolfist> yeah but if she has no purpose then how is she not hollow?
[3:13:11] <awsomesaucekirby> wait
[3:13:13] <+Gorgodrn> Ludleth tells you of what he did
[3:13:13] <candidateplays> Technically it's the same time as everyehere else. except Firelink + Cemetery of Ash
[3:13:15] <Nepsotic> its not, vaati explained it for you
[3:13:15] <thebehatted> you missed black knight halberd
[3:13:18] <+Noxybaru> But you don't really find anything interesting
[3:13:20] <xddddsorandom> You just aren't good enough
[3:13:23] <xddddsorandom> You can
[3:13:26] <$ooblagis> Her purpose is to look after the shrine
[3:13:28] <copicmario> tree jump pls
[3:13:31] <+Foobe> just strip down naked and take a leap toward that roof
[3:13:38] <+Gorgodrn> @Nepsotic It might be surprising to you, but we can all read the game's text
[3:13:49] <Zereaux> SO BLOODBOURNE IS PART OF THE PAINTED WORLD YOU SAY
[3:13:53] <%mitchteck> You can totally get on the roof
[3:13:53] <Midnight188> I don't think a Fire Keeper can go Hollow, they're full of infinite humanity.
[3:13:55] <awsomesaucekirby> man, grinding here while sleepy is SUPER dangerous
[3:13:59] <CaptainKarite> I can't believe Greirat is fucking dead
[3:14:05] <$Mornaka> aw
[3:14:06] <%Divryne> LUL
[3:14:07] <xddddsorandom> Damn
[3:14:07] <%Kazooki_Kazami> aw
[3:14:08] <Midnight188> they're basically fleshbags full of humanity
[3:14:10] <%Kazooki_Kazami> Jebaited
[3:14:10] <OwlLightningMage> Bloodborne is actually Armored Core canon
[3:14:10] <eco419> uwu
[3:14:11] <%Spydurman> Jebaited
[3:14:11] <copicmario> I imagine the fire keeper as Paige in a wig doing a voice as pat yells at her to hurry up
[3:14:13] <+Stereotreme> activate great music!
[3:14:14] <zaptar13> @gorgodrn Masaka?!
[3:14:16] <SuperMintSoda> LUL
[3:14:17] <Nepsotic> @gorgodrn I'm clapping right now. I'm also wondering what vaati's assumptions have to do with ingame text. Source or gtfo maaate
[3:14:17] <zamzoph> music change WutFace
[3:14:19] <$RaikenTB> Firekeeper <3
[3:14:20] <xddddsorandom> When the video game waifu has more priority than real life girls
[3:14:20] <Piiavc> YEAH
[3:14:21] <thebehatted> time for big sad music
[3:14:23] <Piiavc> aww
[3:14:23] <%NovaKnightmare> BETRAYAL
[3:14:27] <Flyrant> eyes Kreygasm
[3:14:27] <benjiFG> PLEASE MAAM
[3:14:28] <dekkitout> why cant things in fiction just be separate -no, i do not mean a multiverse-
[3:14:35] <TheMilhouseExperience> Humanities are litterally crawling around in their skin.
[3:14:36] <Zereaux> SO DES IS A PAINTED WORLD YOU SAY
[3:14:37] <cizal11> nice
[3:14:38] <Nepsotic> best firelink ost
[3:14:42] <eco419> prisoner chain
[3:14:45] <majindusto> Greirat is Fucking Dead...And you Murdered Him!!!
[3:14:47] <TheChillRoom> Large goo.
[3:14:52] <zamzoph> I freaked out and worried that I did a bad when I first gave her the eyes
[3:14:52] <Kalcom> I love goo man
[3:14:54] <OwlLightningMage> Dark Souls is Sans
[3:15:06] <SuperMintSoda> this entire time pat had a lump of goo in his pants
[3:15:06] <+Gorgodrn> @Nepsotic The fact that Ludleth literally tells you that they killed the firekeeper, and that Gundyr's stuff tells you he was a failed Champion of Ash. Textually
[3:15:09] <+FloorBurger> Enbiggen
[3:15:12] <%Kazooki_Kazami> biggest poise
[3:15:14] <Piiavc> he look its ring of favor 2
[3:15:28] <Zereaux> SO THE LUMP OF GO IS THE PAINTED WORLD YOU SAY
[3:15:28] <%NovaKnightmare> How come you cant wear it on ur penis?
[3:15:30] <b1gboss007> FAP 2
[3:15:37] <xddddsorandom> Imagine wearing a rusted chain around your finger
[3:15:44] <%Divryne> Blade of the.
[3:15:45] <$Mornaka> itchy
[3:15:55] <%Kazooki_Kazami> thickest boy
[3:15:56] <TheMilhouseExperience> What a nice change in Firelink music.
[3:15:56] <valdorick> Aaaaaw, the sound of betrayal to the fire.
[3:15:58] <awsomesaucekirby> TETNUS RING
[3:16:00] <+CyberTheory> @xddddsorandom you dont?
[3:16:00] <SulfurousAcid> give her the eyes
[3:16:02] <Kalcom> go thicc
[3:16:07] <Flyrant> he did
[3:16:09] <%NovaKnightmare> FATTY
[3:16:11] <Zereaux> so whens excalibur gonna be in smash
[3:16:11] <+Foobe> Pastaslayer Papyrus and Executioner Sans?
[3:16:18] <Nepsotic> @gorgodrn And yet you don't do any kind of time travel. The only time there has been actual time travel in DS is Oolacile, and that throaway line from Solaire that everyone tries to use to explain away everything. People can't accept that 95% of DS lore is assumption
[3:16:19] <SuperMintSoda> give her the eyes, then kill her and take them back
[3:16:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> T H I C C
[3:16:20] <%around_40_jobbers> B E E F
[3:16:21] <+trnzero> Tubba boi
[3:16:23] <$ooblagis> Is he aiming to a particular armour set?
[3:16:23] <$Mornaka> BIG BOI
[3:16:23] <xddddsorandom> YOUR SO FAT
[3:16:25] <dekkitout> im assuming everyone in these games has a protective layer of grime on them
[3:16:26] <valdorick> Dats a good theme right there, I love the "You're an asshole" theme
[3:16:27] <+CyberTheory> B I G
[3:16:27] <xddddsorandom> SQUISH
[3:16:27] <%Divryne> FATTY.
[3:16:29] <TheEnablerr> mmmmmm CLIP
[3:16:30] <+Gorgodrn> @Nepsotic ANd if you don't talk to the lady in regular Firelink before you talk to her in Untended Firelink she recognizes you.
[3:16:30] <xddddsorandom> BIG SQUISH
[3:16:31] <nepwar> EA BIG
[3:16:32] <Yummy_Nukes> BEEFY BOY
[3:16:35] <Kalcom> light armor and heavy everything
[3:16:39] <jeosadn> NO CAPES
[3:16:39] <majindusto> BIG CLIP
[3:16:41] <+FloorBurger> Bye Tarkus.
[3:16:43] <TheEnablerr> a heavier head eh
[3:16:46] <candidateplays> @Nepsotic You time travel every time you leave Firelink shrine
[3:16:54] <thebehatted> rip Tarkus FeelsBadMan
[3:17:00] <+Noxybaru> Shield ain't even necessary, the bonus regen paltry as fuck
[3:17:01] <OwlLightningMage> DS2 was orginally supposed to have all about time travel before they changed everything in the game
[3:17:03] <$Mornaka> I miss Tarkus
[3:17:04] <xddddsorandom> T A R K U S T A R K U S
[3:17:07] <+CyberTheory> BIG. S T R O N K
[3:17:09] <+Bouerd> Gundyr's armor is heavy as shit
[3:17:11] <Zereaux> PICK a street fighter for a souls boss go!
[3:17:13] <$MoogleKnightTV> Hey Pat what mic do you use?
[3:17:20] <copicmario> Treeeee jup
[3:17:20] <Kalcom> WE UP HERE
[3:17:20] <Flyrant> Blanka
[3:17:22] <Nepsotic> @gorgodrn I don't disagree, I just find it hilarious that these games rarely explain most things and people read into shit, and then just espouse it as lore
[3:17:26] <dekkitout> zubaz SeriousSloth
[3:17:26] <$ooblagis> @OwlLightningMage You have a source for that?
[3:17:30] <+Gorgodrn> This game also had heavy time travel mechanics in the early game
[3:17:42] <$MoogleKnightTV> Thanks! I'm hoping to get a living room setup going soon and know nothing about microphones lol
[3:17:43] <TheChillRoom> @Zereaux Vega would be fun. Or Dhalsim
[3:17:45] <Nepsotic> DS2 was supposed to have a lot of things
[3:17:52] <thebehatted> uh oh
[3:17:57] <thebehatted> UH OH PAT
[3:18:00] <SirDogBear> at least hes getting more souls this time as he farms
[3:18:10] <Kalcom> wait, are those black or silver
[3:18:10] <Zereaux> get smoked
[3:18:14] <TheMilhouseExperience> Sir! Sir!
[3:18:15] <Kalcom> im blind
[3:18:18] <thebehatted> these are black knights
[3:18:24] <TheChillRoom> They're purple
[3:18:26] <nepwar> Sir excuse me sir
[3:18:30] <Inebriateddonut> Grey knights
[3:18:33] <Nepsotic> racism in the chat
[3:18:34] <Flyrant> DS2 was supposed to be good
[3:18:38] <thebehatted> morally grey knights
[3:18:38] <+FloorBurger> You had gloves
[3:18:42] <Zereaux> ds2 is bad
[3:18:47] <Zereaux> feels floaty
[3:18:48] <Nepsotic> @flyrant I don't believe you
[3:18:55] <Zereaux> dun like
[3:18:56] <dekkitout> "We prefer 'Urban' Knights"
[3:19:03] <Flyrant> heheh
[3:19:06] <%RedMaskBandit> Ur inventory hurts my eyes
[3:19:09] <TheChillRoom> DS2 was good. IF you played it as basically a Soul Calibur-like with a story mode
[3:19:09] <$Mornaka> HA
[3:19:11] <majindusto> Only Pat would get nearly killed while in menus
[3:19:13] <%xemnahort> @Flyrant and yet it was amazing instead
[3:19:13] <Nepsotic> NEED THE UH FEET
[3:19:18] <+Surf_Zombie> I thought I saw the gloves too. Could be crazy though
[3:19:21] <OwlLightningMage> @ooblagis I can't link anything in the chat but if you look up cut content for DS2 it's something that comes up.
[3:19:26] <SuperMintSoda> African Lordranian Knights
[3:19:27] <TalisKanju> Monday Knights
[3:19:31] <%Spydurman> do-op do-op
[3:19:32] <Nepsotic> @xemnahort carciGasm
[3:19:33] <Zereaux> YO YOSHIMITSU IN DARK SOULS
[3:19:36] <Flyrant> @xemnahort lies and slander
[3:19:37] <awsomesaucekirby> pat, the route is left side, rust to top of hill, then stairs, then drop on axe guy
[3:19:39] <nepwar> need elmos feet beep beep
[3:19:43] <eco419> SHOW FEET
[3:19:44] <Piiavc> doesnt that mace gives you instant poise on l2?
[3:19:48] <$ooblagis> DS2 is the best Souls game, and the world is insane to think otherwise
[3:19:50] <$Mornaka> It is surprising how non utilitarian Pat's inventory is
[3:19:58] <thebehatted> people don't need to like that game but I'll die on that DS2 hill
[3:20:06] <Zereaux> nuh uh
[3:20:09] <$Mornaka> worth
[3:20:10] <Xiangchang> Halo 4 is the best Souls game.
[3:20:11] <Nepsotic> @ooblagis I know you're joking, but it still triggered me
[3:20:12] <TalisKanju> Why does Paige have a better sign off than you do?
[3:20:12] <CheekyBirb> not only poise, but defence too
[3:20:12] <Zereaux> youll hollow
[3:20:12] <copicmario> you look like freak dino
[3:20:15] <+ShardtheFox> @angriestpat You looked at pathfinder kingmaker at all?
[3:20:16] <OwlLightningMage> @ooblagis I THINK Vaati may have done a video on DS2 cut content for what that's worth
[3:20:26] <+zaxitor> M O R T I S
[3:20:26] <$Mornaka> Stuffed
[3:20:26] <SuperMintSoda> I love how rapidly tapping block with a 2 handed weapon is a universal thing everyone does

[3:20:36] <Inebriateddonut> PLAYER SLAIN
[3:20:37] <SwindlerOfProgress> SICK COMBO
[3:20:37] <SirDogBear> that delay PogChamp
[3:20:39] <%Spydurman> Pat if they made a Dark Souls movie would you want it to be pretty ok or hilariously bad?
[3:20:39] <+FloorBurger> A NEW CHAMP IS CROWNED
[3:20:40] <TheChillRoom> In fairness, DS2 is the Dark Souls I've had the urge to replay the most, so that's something.
[3:20:41] <Kalcom> uppercut cobo
[3:20:42] <%Kazooki_Kazami> oof
[3:20:42] <$ooblagis> It's a great Baldur's Gate style game
[3:20:45] <OwlLightningMage> Big poise
[3:20:45] <xddddsorandom> IT'S H A P P E N I N G
[3:20:45] <majindusto> SHORYUKEN!!!
[3:20:47] <Flyrant> DS2 Bosses were all trash, it did have some really good additions in terms of game mechanics though
[3:20:50] <elspiceweasel> you should get stabbed less
[3:20:51] <dekkitout> he comin for that title
[3:20:53] <$Frog_The_Bandit> Holy shit whoever just asked Pat about Pathfinder: Kingmaker, I'm literally playing it right now.
[3:20:53] <+discodemolition> it's broken af
[3:20:53] <SwindlerOfProgress> That Black Knight had some strong oki.
[3:20:57] <Nepsotic> @thechillroom To you that's something
[3:20:57] <$ooblagis> It was fucked up for like a month
[3:21:03] <$ooblagis> It's more or less fixed now
[3:21:05] <+Foobe> DS2's power stancing is just my favorite thing ever
[3:21:05] <Bouldus> pathfinder kingmaker, is like a not quite as good Pillars of Eternity
[3:21:05] <Midnight188> everyone gives so much shit to DS2 but I had the most fun with it than 1 or 3
[3:21:07] <+Badgerconda_> Pat you'd love Kingmaker. It's like Baldur's gate.
[3:21:08] <Zereaux> USE YOMI PAT
[3:21:09] <%Kazooki_Kazami> FEEEEEEET

[3:21:27] <zaptar13> Would it be worth getting Prince of Persia on Steam? Never played it before.
[3:21:31] <%Kazooki_Kazami> FEET GOT
[3:21:31] <$Frog_The_Bandit> @AngriestPat Most of the "fucked-up-ness" came from early bugs in the game. Now most of that has passed and it's a really solid, very long-term oriented RPG.
[3:21:33] <SulfurousAcid> leggies
[3:21:34] <eco419> yeee
[3:21:38] <Flyrant> @TikanZK yeah, you right

[3:21:46] <Zereaux> SO I HEARD PAIGE SOAKS HER FEET IN MUSTARD
[3:21:51] <TheChillRoom> @Nepsotic Indeed! I play Dark Souls games like build-a-fighter style fighting games, though. Once I have a character I'm content with I just invade or go blue
[3:21:56] <DracaenaLeaf> You went from fat armor to skinny armor whoa
[3:21:59] <+FloorBurger> Become Martin Lawrence.
[3:22:00] <OwlLightningMage> Is Kingdom Come Deliverance still fucked up with bugs?
[3:22:01] <%Kazooki_Kazami> the mace is so cool
[3:22:02] <Worldbrand> common misconception; paige's feet ARE mustard
[3:22:02] <+ShardtheFox> @angriestpat its really good, but hard. It was fucked on release, but has recieved like... 40 patches
[3:22:03] <TheEnablerr> Pat has acquired: Black Jeggings
[3:22:06] <Worldbrand> that's why she needs the boots
[3:22:12] <eco419> Urban armor
[3:22:17] <DracaenaLeaf> dude rainbow colored chat
[3:22:24] <awsomesaucekirby> Left side, top of hill, stairs, drop on axe
[3:22:29] <Zereaux> so she can eat the gunk betixt her toes and taste the mustardy goodnes
[3:22:30] <+Stereotreme> the eldritch truth uncovered at 100 insight: Paige is a mustard slug
[3:22:30] <%Spydurman> feet to the yeet
[3:22:38] <TheChillRoom> Yeet the feet to the street?
[3:22:43] <%MagickBurritoh> Estus is just mustard , that‚Äôs why Paige with her Lupus drinks it, to stay alive.
[3:22:45] <$ooblagis> @OwlLightningMage I don't have first hand experience, but I've heard it and the fucked up DLC have been patched
[3:22:46] <thebehatted> FRENZY

[3:22:51] <$Mornaka> hot
[3:22:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> m u s t a r d s l u g
[3:22:54] <Nepsotic> @awsomesaucekirby dude fuck that DLC to hell. Can barely beat pantheon of the sage and chose giving up over more time spent on that bullshit

[3:23:00] <CheekyBirb> mustard slugs are hot tho Kappa

[3:23:03] <Worldbrand> The real paige was the mustard we chugged along the way
[3:23:04] <Zereaux> shes got mustards on the inside
[3:23:05] <TheEnablerr> Paige is Mustard Incarnate
[3:23:05] <SuperMintSoda> Paige the vacuous mustard
[3:23:05] <dekkitout> yeet to the feet in the street from the field of wheat
[3:23:06] <thebehatted> ! PAIGE AT RISK !
[3:23:07] <%crimsonharvest> Is there a good reason to wear that hat
[3:23:10] <+Badgerconda_> Paige is a Dark Souls who subsists on Mustard instead of Souls
[3:23:11] <$Mornaka> yummy
[3:23:12] <Bouldus> :o
[3:23:14] <dekkitout> take a seat
[3:23:14] <bringer_of_flowers> can you make any weapon an ice weapon, or are there specific weapons that have ice when you get them
[3:23:15] <+FloorBurger> dont

[3:23:24] <%Imperial_Madman> I will remember this
[3:23:24] <awsomesaucekirby> Paige of the Deep MUSTARD
[3:23:24] <OwlLightningMage> Someone is gonna steal that hair
[3:23:25] <nepwar> only in night does paige become a slug *wink*

[3:23:29] <TheEnablerr> Paige the Mustard Presence
[3:23:30] <Cherokia666> Paige is Patient Zero of mustard
[3:23:32] <%BrazenMask> You should make a talisman of some sort from the elmo hair
[3:23:32] <xddddsorandom> CONFISCATE THE CAT HAIR
[3:23:36] <SuperMintSoda> "Fear the old mustard"
[3:23:37] <xddddsorandom> PUT IT IN A VILE
[3:23:37] <Midnight188> I get the feeling there is a lot of hair to give, Elmo looks like he sheds hardcore.
[3:23:39] <%Spydurman> naw just put it in a baggie they'll never know
[3:23:41] <Zereaux> if you dip elmo in mustard will page eat him?
[3:23:42] <Nepsotic> You know a game is bad when darksydephil actually makes legitimate complaints about it
[3:23:43] <%SaltyDongs> drug laced hair
[3:23:43] <Inebriateddonut> Just grind it down so it looks like cocaine so you can bring it on aa plane
[3:23:43] <%Everpresent_Overseer> takes it for himself
[3:23:44] <eco419> clone the baby
[3:23:46] <OwlLightningMage> Guy?

[3:24:00] <xddddsorandom> Say it's hair of a deceased relative
[3:24:06] <Cherokia666> May WE were the mustard all along and Paige has been eating us slowly
[3:24:06] <nepwar> They take it away because they want the elmo hair just like the guard in the podcast that took the guys lunch
[3:24:08] <copicmario> no trash monster
[3:24:09] <Midnight188> a House of Elmos?

[3:24:38] <%Everpresent_Overseer> sword

[3:25:29] <TheChillRoom> Well Pat, maybe the hands don't come around because you keep calling them stupid.
[3:25:32] <MultipleJiggs> Clone Steve Buscomo?
[3:25:34] <OwlLightningMage> Elmo with Pat's anxiety literally could not exist

[3:32:25] <eco419> Pat instability go up
[3:32:25] <%MagickBurritoh> THICC LIKE PAT
[3:32:27] <Zereaux> anything going in monster hunter

[3:32:42] <Grimlockfly> unequip your shield
[3:32:42] <Flyrant> damn surprised Pat is so chill, I would ban that dude
[3:32:43] <Zereaux> anything going ON in MH WOLRF
[3:32:44] <gustavozxd> you equip a cape in that game and it clips through every single weapon
[3:32:46] <+Sinister_Aglet> I BET THEY HOLD HANDS IN PRIVATE
[3:32:48] <+NWR_James> Clipped through backdowns
[3:32:50] <bsmusic> That was a pretty personal question
[3:32:52] <Nepsotic> listen to hbomberguy and unequip your shield... he's a smart guy right? Kappa
[3:32:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat is pure
[3:32:57] <zamzoph> Cape-clipping for Crossbone in Gundam Versus is really bad
[3:33:02] <%Spydurman> they fuck through a sheet like the Irish
[3:33:02] <derap41> When he chops your balls of with his axe
[3:33:07] <Joem1k> @AngriestPat they just announced that cowboy bebop will be getting a live action remake done by netflix. People they've got attached to it are pretty legit and the original creator is going to be a consultant on that show. Gonna be 10 episodes.
[3:33:09] <TheMilhouseExperience> The answer is nunya.
[3:33:09] <xddddsorandom> AngriestPat Why haven't they fixed clipping yet Pat

[3:33:33] <CheekyBirb> wrong set of tits Kappa
[3:33:37] <TheEnablerr> "We need capes to make it look dynamic" no it looks like SHIT if it clips

[3:34:08] <Nepsotic> Stop being fatphobic
[3:34:10] <CheekyBirb> smough with his weird toe shoes
[3:34:12] <%Hilleltaco> That only gives him strength
[3:34:12] <xddddsorandom> I didn't know they put Pat in the game
[3:34:14] <Coystick> Tiddies too fat
[3:34:16] <%skizzuto> Flat is justice

[3:34:23] <%NovaKnightmare> BRING IT BACK
[3:34:24] <$ooblagis> Just build for fashion, armour does next to nothing
[3:34:26] <xddddsorandom> I'm sorry Pat
[3:34:27] <Zereaux> KEEP BIG LEG
[3:34:30] <SulfurousAcid> look dumb instead
[3:34:37] <+97Riman> You planning on playing shadow bringers?
[3:34:38] <Kalcom> keep arms
[3:34:39] <eco419> LUL
[3:34:40] <Zereaux> NEIN
[3:34:40] <SulfurousAcid> fuck fasion
[3:34:41] <OwlLightningMage> Cool > stats
[3:34:42] <Xiangchang> Dragonslayer Armor and Lorian's pants look great together.
[3:34:43] <derap41> Seigmire and Fatso is a great combo
[3:34:45] <grayjammer> Numbers are better than fashion
[3:34:47] <CheekyBirb> keep smoughs legs
[3:34:47] <+NWR_James> Naked is coolest. do that
[3:34:48] <Flyrant> but COOL is the best stat Pat!
[3:34:49] <$Mornaka> @OwlLightningMage ^
[3:34:51] <voyagerwitch> armor doesnt do anything in ds3 as long as your have something in every slot
[3:34:52] <Nepsotic> pat, armor in this game really does mean nothing, as long as you have something equipped in every slot you're good
[3:34:55] <Piiavc> stats only matter up to 20 btw
[3:34:56] <xddddsorandom> BEING COOL IS ALL THAT MATTERS
[3:34:57] <awsomesaucekirby> SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc
[3:35:01] <Piiavc> 20 absorption
[3:35:01] <Zereaux> DANKE DANKE
[3:35:03] <%NovaKnightmare> Yes
[3:35:05] <CheekyBirb> yes
[3:35:06] <Piiavc> yeah
[3:35:06] <@Mechz71> i dunno
[3:35:06] <OwlLightningMage> Yes
[3:35:07] <eco419> yea
[3:35:08] <+Bouerd> Yep
[3:35:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> maybe
[3:35:08] <derap41> Always shield of want nothing else matters
[3:35:10] <HyperBomb21> The best medium shield
[3:35:12] <+Nobrev> FASHION OVER FUNCTION FOREVER
[3:35:13] <+Stereotreme> yup
[3:35:13] <CheekyBirb> still considered the better shield
[3:35:14] <Zereaux> NO ALL SHIELDS ARE BAD PAT
[3:35:14] <sodium_station> only stats to care about are elemental resistance and poise
[3:35:15] <Piiavc> you have to upgrade it thopp
[3:35:18] <IShadowStrykerI> definitely
[3:35:21] <Nepsotic> Yes
[3:35:24] <SplatterAte> i always went shield of want
[3:35:26] <+Nobrev> by shield is amazing
[3:35:27] <xddddsorandom> STOP TELLING HIM SHIELDS ARE BAD CHAT
[3:35:28] <HyperBomb21> Great Shields are trash in DS3
[3:35:29] <%Kazooki_Kazami> tarkus tarkus tarkus
[3:35:36] <OwlLightningMage> You sold the greatshield with the best poise
[3:35:37] <derap41> Shield of want is the only thing worth having just for the souls
[3:35:42] <Zereaux> ROLL IS BETTER THAN SHIELD
[3:35:43] <eco419> not gud
[3:35:43] <Tampaoster> get four shields up from tarkus'
[3:35:45] <majindusto> Looking cool is truly whats best!
[3:35:51] <HyperBomb21> DS2 has the best greatshields
[3:35:54] <Inebriateddonut> Only greatshield worth using is DOOR
[3:35:55] <Xiangchang> The Black Iron Greatshield is super great when upgraded.
[3:35:55] <xddddsorandom> But look how cool he looks
[3:35:56] <+FloorBurger> medium shields all day.
[3:35:56] <Flyrant> dual wield 2 great shields
[3:35:58] <Nepsotic> @xddddsorandom but hbomberguy said everyone has more fun without shields!
[3:36:03] <Zereaux> SHIELD MAKE WEAK THE PAT ROLL MAKE PAT THE CHONKING
[3:36:03] <%Faustgesicht> LOOKIT THE TURTLE
[3:36:04] <CheekyBirb> dang black knight shield is yuge
[3:36:04] <Coystick> Dragonhead Greatshield is my shieldfu
[3:36:06] <CaptainKarite> I can't believe Greirat is fucking dead
[3:36:08] <+Nobrev> bk shield is amazing
[3:36:17] <xddddsorandom> ROLL SPEED
[3:36:17] <zamzoph> BK Shield looks a lot cooler
[3:36:20] <grayjammer> The Doors is the best Shield
[3:36:22] <OwlLightningMage> Greatshields were good until the nerfs completely destroyed them
[3:36:24] <Kalcom> use fatty arms
[3:36:24] <Nepsotic> @captainkarite I don't think he dies until you send him yo lothric
[3:36:36] <dekkitout> he got sent to lothric, no?
[3:36:36] <Flyrant> pat did send him to lothric
[3:36:36] <nepwar> bloodborne shield best shield
[3:36:42] <Them00n> does upgrading increase poise?
[3:36:47] <Nepsotic> Oh I thought he got sent to Irithyll
[3:36:48] <Zereaux> PAT BE STRINGST ROLLING CONKING
[3:36:53] <%Faustgesicht> Lake shield bois
[3:36:53] <CheekyBirb> upgrading increases the stability
[3:36:54] <TheMilhouseExperience> In general, everything is more fun when you're riding a line away from safety.
[3:36:57] <voyagerwitch> oh no i saw the neck through the armor
[3:37:01] <Zereaux> ROLLIN BE THE CHONKINGS BATTLE THEME
[3:37:04] <Nepsotic> He can send patches to go save him tho right?
[3:37:08] <Flyrant> oh, maybe it was irathyl, I could be wrong
[3:37:21] <Flyrant> Irithyl even
[3:37:21] <+Stereotreme> Shield of Want is v. good
[3:37:29] <dekkitout> eh somehow itll sort itself out
[3:37:32] <+Stereotreme> worth upgrading, too
[3:37:37] <Finaldragoon> shield of want all day, farm those extra souls
[3:37:38] <Nepsotic> @themilhouseexperience It might be a surprise to you, but fun is actually subjective
[3:37:43] <eco419> nah he took onion armor
[3:37:56] <OwlLightningMage> I think he does need the send Patches or he will die early
[3:37:59] <eco419> greyrat rip
[3:38:03] <CheekyBirb> twinkling
[3:38:15] <Nepsotic> @angriestpat You'd better fuckin send patches before you go into the castle DOOD
[3:38:17] <%commanderclaw> Twinkie Titanite
[3:38:26] <+Gorgodrn> If you send greirat and kill a main game boss, he's dead.
[3:38:32] <Zereaux> using a shield for dark souls is like using a condom for sex. dull and numb
[3:38:34] <grayjammer> Greirat doesn't survive the Grand Archives no matter how you deal with Patches
[3:38:34] <mercado94> just hit them until they die
[3:38:35] <Nepsotic> Well then
[3:38:39] <Flyrant> dancer's probably
[3:38:42] <+Gorgodrn> If he gave the armor to Siegward, Greirat is safe
[3:38:43] <Tampaoster> Lan√ßa Ropera
[3:38:44] <Piiavc> fire dagger
[3:38:48] <%NovaKnightmare> something that is on fire
[3:38:51] <Finaldragoon> if you send Greirat out a 3rd time he dies no matter what, you can snag his ashes in grand archives
[3:38:51] <+DuskSolais> firebombs
[3:38:53] <%RedMaskBandit> Snap freeze
[3:38:56] <Piiavc> frost them with vordts then hit them with a fire dagger
[3:38:57] <Cthulos> !Uptime
[3:38:57] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 38m 59s.
[3:38:58] <aeonicvector> I'd say a quick secondary poison weapon to enforce more poison
[3:38:59] <wowthisnamecanbequitelong> fire surge is best tbh
[3:39:03] <Coystick> I'm using demon scar
[3:39:04] <Zereaux> SEMEN
[3:39:08] <+Gorgodrn> If he sends patches cause you missed Siegward, Greirat is saved
[3:39:10] <Tampaoster> Lanza Ropera
[3:39:11] <mercado94> but for real something with fire
[3:39:16] <OwlLightningMage> Never mind. He's dead either way. No saving him from the castle
[3:39:17] <Nepsotic> He did give it to siegward, but siegward is dead
[3:39:34] <grayjammer> I like the Patches sub-plot in this game, 'cuz he genuinely cares about Greirat.
[3:39:37] <Zereaux> cestus
[3:39:37] <%crimsonharvest> Lanza Ropera sounds like you want me to throw clothes at you
[3:39:37] <Tampaoster> i dont remember the name
[3:39:39] <nepwar> a big club
[3:39:41] <voyagerwitch> if its this late there probably wont be warframe yet right?
[3:39:51] <+MrMcCrabby> torch
[3:39:52] <Zereaux> ora them to death
[3:39:52] <aeonicvector> Frost drains their hp, poison keeps em defensive after healing, Frost reprocs fairly quicky
[3:39:53] <voyagerwitch> er, at all tonight
[3:40:00] <IShadowStrykerI> id say poison claws
[3:40:01] <Flyrant> the witch whip
[3:40:02] <SulfurousAcid> hell yeah whip
[3:40:03] <aeonicvector> also works with bleed whip if your brazen
[3:40:04] <Inebriateddonut> !uptime
[3:40:04] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 40m 6s.
[3:40:04] <awsomesaucekirby> or a ae nae
[3:40:05] <Coystick> whip would look cool
[3:40:05] <Nepsotic> Patches' arc in the DLC is even better
[3:40:07] <Flyrant> I forget the name
[3:40:08] <Zereaux> flame san
[3:40:11] <aeonicvector> poison the bleed whip
[3:40:16] <OwlLightningMage> Poison is terrible for PvP
[3:40:20] <Inebriateddonut> Yeah probably no Warframe tonight
[3:40:25] <Flyrant> not yet, it's in the Archives
[3:40:27] <aeonicvector> Poisons fine for it, if the fight goes long
[3:40:30] <copicmario> blacksmith hammer
[3:40:31] <Coystick> witch whip is in Grand Archives
[3:40:31] <IShadowStrykerI> poison claws or you could oison the bleed whip
[3:40:33] <Nepsotic> Bleed is probably the best PvP modifier
[3:40:33] <%around_40_jobbers> where my bleed bois at?
[3:40:36] <grayjammer> @Nepsotic I know, but hes still the best even in the base game
[3:40:37] <Tampaoster> Witch locks
[3:40:37] <awsomesaucekirby> cover the whip in disease syringes
[3:40:41] <zaptar13> Use bleed
[3:40:41] <voyagerwitch> the hypnotic allure of dark souls...
[3:40:44] <%Kazooki_Kazami> soldering iron apatSmug
[3:40:47] <Zereaux> time for me to play ds 3
[3:40:49] <%RedMaskBandit> Poison scimitar
[3:40:51] <eco419> i prefer the greatroot lance for poison
[3:40:55] <OwlLightningMage> It's bad for invaders that can heal. It's only okay for dueling
[3:40:56] <TheGrimmHuntsman> The Witch whip is behind a wall in the archives.
[3:41:03] <Kalcom> use fatty hands
[3:41:25] <aeonicvector> Optimally, you'd be going Lucky Ted + Quality for Status, but since Frost isnt affected by luck, its NBD
[3:41:31] <TheGrimmHuntsman> Iron Man MKI
[3:41:41] <+AXL808> can't help you, my ass is handed to me every time in PvP
[3:41:45] <eco419> anything
[3:41:48] <Nepsotic> luck actually has a use?
[3:41:48] <CopperTucker> @serpenttucker well we clearly have to fight to the death
[3:41:49] <zamzoph> CHAOS CHAOS
[3:41:51] <faegbeard> m e t a m o r p h o s i s
[3:41:53] <%xemnahort> which weapon has the highest frost build up
[3:41:58] <CopperTucker> there can only be one
[3:42:01] <+NWR_James> CHAOSLEGION?
[3:42:01] <Zereaux> also mesa is thick lady no?
[3:42:02] <Cherokia666> I will never be able to do anything ;.;
[3:42:04] <%around_40_jobbers> Praise the Omnisiah
[3:42:05] <awsomesaucekirby> PURGE THE HERETICS!
[3:42:07] <+Taxerus> needs more Giantdad
[3:42:09] <Midnight188> the only pvp build I managed was Hide n Seek Man and that was just for lulz
[3:42:12] <+Tactical_Waifu> shadbaseMercy dex is for betas
[3:42:13] <voyagerwitch> mesa's skinny
[3:42:23] <%Laecerelius> I can‚Äôt wait until Mesa Prime!
[3:43:01] <OwlLightningMage> I hope so
[3:43:04] <zaptar13> Banjo Kazooie confirmed
[3:43:06] <SulfurousAcid> Pat look at phone immediately
[3:43:07] <%around_40_jobbers> There's only 1 stat and its' endurance
[3:43:07] <Carnuno> not yet
[3:43:08] <Cherokia666> BangDream is a good one
[3:43:11] <Midnight188> someday my gurl Khora Prime will happen
[3:43:14] <%Laecerelius> Not yet
[3:43:17] <faegbeard> HxH is just green naruto before green naruto was good
[3:43:23] <OwlLightningMage> Mesa is already Prime in my heart
[3:43:24] <voyagerwitch> mesa prime's the next one though
[3:43:24] <@Mechz71> i think you were bamboozled
[3:43:25] <nepwar> mesa prime time has come
[3:43:26] <Worldbrand> She is next in line and it was mentioned by several articles. Expect December
[3:43:28] <%badchoice5> Hey, did I miss the whole stream yet?
[3:43:29] <SeventyForce> @AngriestPat It's about the wish, basically they just said "Those 6 things from the dark world would kill all humans" and you-know-who is on it
[3:43:29] <$Mornaka> My room mate left 5 crackers in the cracker box
[3:43:31] <awsomesaucekirby> Love how nintendo is blocking hacked smash games for 100 years
[3:43:36] <%Laecerelius> She should be next
[3:43:41] <eco419> hxh was before naruto dude
[3:43:42] <dekkitout> i remember seeing a fairly accurate predication post for when the next primes come out but no news that ive seen
[3:43:43] <awsomesaucekirby> best news ever
[3:43:45] <SunsetJack> It's gonna be Mesa Prime because the next one has to be release around December.
[3:43:49] <Worldbrand> mesa prime has been predicted to come out next month for like years, so no surprise
[3:43:52] <voyagerwitch> it's mentioned in the wf switch fact sheet
[3:43:52] <OwlLightningMage> Is that 100 years number real?
[3:43:59] <$Mornaka> who leaves 5 crackers
[3:43:59] <OwlLightningMage> That's funny LUL
[3:44:02] <voyagerwitch> she's going to be included with the nova + mag prime vault package
[3:44:13] <awsomesaucekirby> @OwlLightningMage yeah, but they posted the number in minutes
[3:44:14] <Worldbrand> That I very much doubt.
[3:44:19] <SunsetJack> If they release Equinox Prime, they need to rework her before release so it will definitely be Mesa next.
[3:44:19] <Worldbrand> Prime access and prime vault are always separate
[3:44:28] <Piiavc> great clubs pretty good for pvpv
[3:44:29] <%Spydurman> she's shit posting on twitter
[3:44:29] <faegbeard> get out of my swamp
[3:44:30] <Worldbrand> They may overlap, but they are separate packages
[3:44:34] <OwlLightningMage> That might as well say lifetime ban LUL
[3:44:34] <%around_40_jobbers> C H U N K
[3:44:39] <+Badgerconda_> CHONK
[3:44:40] <Midnight188> missing those CHONKS?
[3:44:40] <booglesnurf> 100 years of regular showers
[3:44:43] <zaptar13> Their grandkids will be able to play when the 100 years are up
[3:44:47] <nepwar> gotta find the super chunk
[3:45:00] <eco419> big caveman
[3:45:02] <derap41> Going clubbing?
[3:45:02] <+Badgerconda_> I thought Pat had all the chunk.
[3:45:04] <OwlLightningMage> My baby Equinox doesn't need a rework BibleThump
[3:45:06] <arfsm95> ah the eternal "do i look good with bad stats or horrible with good stats"
[3:45:07] <TheMilhouseExperience> So much for a better service.
[3:45:08] <Nepsotic> @piiavc Except all strength weapons pretty much suck in PvP if you're fighting someone who knows what they're doing
[3:45:13] <cizal11> @AngriestPat dlc time
[3:45:23] <voyagerwitch> do links work in this chat?
[3:45:29] <DracaenaLeaf> CANDLE HEADDDDD
[3:45:31] <@Mechz71> warframe time
[3:45:38] <Worldbrand> I think they'll be filtered
[3:45:49] <Zereaux> it is fun doing gestures in front of the maiden
[3:45:50] <@Mechz71> WARFRAME TIEM >:(
[3:45:50] <voyagerwitch> fair enough. i was gonna link my sources, but
[3:45:53] <Worldbrand> I am aware of the switch article you're talking about that mentions mesa prime though
[3:45:53] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat what is the build you're going to do?
[3:45:57] <cizal11> you have a +5 weapon and it was way back at cathedral of the deep
[3:46:07] <voyagerwitch> theres also a kotaku thing
[3:46:10] <%forevern2dust> !uptime
[3:46:11] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 46m 12s.

[3:46:51] <+Taxerus> low key feel like "stream sniping" CarlSmile
[3:46:53] <dekkitout> the denser than a white dwarf build aka the denss build (with 2 s's)
[3:47:01] <zamzoph> NOT BIG ENOUGH IF YOU DON'T FAT ROLL
[3:47:03] <%badchoice5> Has Pat actually become MORE of a facetanking build in the few hours I missed? HOW!>
[3:47:18] <Worldbrand> I wouldn't put stock into the kotaku one, and not because of kotaku memes. It mentions "mesa, mag, and chroma prime." No mention of Nova.
[3:47:23] <+Chud_Pudsley> I prefer to master the fat roll
[3:47:28] <+Chud_Pudsley> It impresses people
[3:47:29] <aeonicvector> Fat roll isnt THAT bad in this game, only GREAT roll is <30% roll (more range)
[3:47:29] <Nepsotic> @taxerus Good luck with that, I've been trying to invade him since the stream started and only got into his world shard once, the invasion failed lol
[3:47:36] <voyagerwitch> well nova just doesnt go :V
[3:47:39] <Xiangchang> Can't wait to outpoise The Ringed City! \[T]/
[3:47:40] <+Taxerus> rip in piece
[3:47:43] <%around_40_jobbers> Pat can take anytihng to the face
[3:47:43] <OwlLightningMage> I wish Chroma got a proper rework.
[3:47:52] <Worldbrand> ... but she's there. In the prime unvaulting. Right now.

[3:49:41] <%FrostMass22> Pat lost his shins in the war
[3:49:42] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat that's because you have heavy armor with a ring that makes you take more damage

[3:52:32] <eco419> i see a ded
[3:52:35] <derap41> Gladiators had dad bods because the extra layer of fat protected them from deeper cuts that would scar the muscles
[3:52:38] <Tampaoster> invade pat
[3:52:41] <TalisKanju> Is it your bedtime Pat?
[3:52:41] <%RedMaskBandit> Oh yeah greyrat is on the rooftop past the gargoyles
[3:52:43] <Carnuno> he comin
[3:52:49] <Tampaoster> CHONKEST INVASIONS!
[3:52:52] <voyagerwitch> i want to point out that i suggested the winged knight armor before he picked it up without remembering that it was there
[3:53:05] <%badchoice5> LOL
[3:53:06] <Worldbrand> hahahaha
[3:53:06] <Coystick> Need that fat to take a shiv or two
[3:53:08] <cizal11> LFMAO
[3:53:10] <$Mornaka> safety fst
[3:53:11] <eco419> hahaha
[3:53:15] <$Mornaka> fat
[3:53:20] <%badchoice5> AXE AXE GOTTA GET THE AXE
[3:53:22] <eco419> 5 days later
[3:53:24] <Sleepology> body builder bod is fake as shit
[3:53:32] <+Badgerconda_> Everyone knows dad bod is the superior fighting bod. Have you guys never heard of dad strength?
[3:53:34] <majindusto> Bulk Biceps!
[3:53:36] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I CLAP WHEN FAT MAN ROLL
[3:53:38] <+TheMattman1313> Man is the stream almost over? I already prescription roofied myself so my ability to stay awake is dwindling.
[3:53:38] <Coystick> Fat is actually subdermal armor
[3:53:39] <+HierophantMica> we need some gratuitous tuba music for that heavy walk
[3:53:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> theres a reason its called STRONG FAT
[3:53:42] <TheEnablerr> @derap41 so gladiators gave themselves primordial pouches like cats?
[3:53:45] <CheekyBirb> optimal strenght bodies have ballies
[3:53:46] <grayjammer> Papa Power
[3:53:48] <%crimsonharvest> i got 200% heat/cold resistance and 4x water capacity but basically negative movement
[3:53:53] <dekkitout> that iconic lift a john deere over your head strength
[3:53:58] <%badchoice5> You can get a lotta strength when you stop worrying about low body fat percentage
[3:54:02] <CheekyBirb> optimal strong bodies have bellies

[4:01:34] <mercado94> been playing smash since it leak. not gonna spoil shit so all im gonna say is that World of Light is pretty fucking good
[4:01:35] <Coystick> NG you assemble your build NG+ you enjoy your build
[4:01:35] <benjiFG> why does the game give you raw gems this late
[4:01:35] <%xemnahort> @SuperiorDelta man all you needed was a hexer and you have it all
[4:01:36] <CheekyBirb> eh, the game's design to play all of them at any time tho?
[4:01:36] <%moranprime> Fists only Kappa
[4:01:38] <Flyrant> Mules are for fucc bois
[4:01:40] <cizal11> does he also not understand monster hunter or something?
[4:01:42] <Sleepology> @Nepsotic can't tell if youre joking but isnt the icon next to stamina regen buff at the top left for the calamity ring?
[4:01:43] <+uwu_Bread> plus theres only enough mats to fully upgrade like 5 weapons anyway
[4:01:43] <+GingerTwerk213> FENCE

[4:01:47] <Inebriateddonut> THIN VERSUS CHONK
[4:01:47] <%badchoice5> Nah, play through a bunch of the game with one weapon, then finish with a similar boss weapon
[4:01:51] <eco419> Old man yell at clouds
[4:01:52] <gustavozxd> I might get a switch with smash for Christmas, so I'm not exactly hyped for the game rn LUL
[4:01:57] <grayjammer> DS3 is designed to be a bit more lenient in allowing you to max out multiple weapons, but Pat's still correct
[4:01:59] <@Mechz71> distraction successful
[4:02:00] <+AXL808> "Nyrgh! How dare you enjoy the game differently than me!"
[4:02:00] <cizal11> wow the stagger

[4:02:09] <%badchoice5> Wow, this enemy is way easier when you don't have to dodge or do anything but swing
[4:02:09] <JoeNeutrino> I like to use several weapons if I can get enough upgrade materials but using one weapon is fine too.
[4:02:11] <gustavozxd> I'll be sure to stop by tho
[4:02:13] <Nepsotic> @commanderclaw well it IS the (second) best one

[4:16:29] <voyagerwitch> ive beaten this game with like 3 characters and tbh i think im good
[4:16:31] <Nepsotic> Maybe if we ALL try and invade pat at the same time, one us of might get in his game this year, maybe. Probably not actually

[4:16:44] <Nepsotic> Yea save the poor dragon boi carciThump
[4:16:46] <$luckypineapple> demons souls is both the best and the worst game, because it has the best story and levels and some of the best bosses, but its aged and has a LOT of stupid mechanics
[4:16:54] <+AXL808> i like enchanting the enemies in this level so they fight each other now that you're fighting hollows again
[4:17:06] <$Mendin> You'd think that since I technically connected to him via darkmoon shit once, that I'd be able to actually invade Pat now but nooooo
[4:17:07] <valriot> That one area in Ringed City is so fucked and theres nothing even good there, its baffling
[4:17:21] <Nepsotic> @luckypineapple Most of what you said is subjective though unless you can actually quantify it
[4:17:22] <eco419> nice run
[4:17:33] <%blazymaniac> thanks for the strem pat, but im off to bed

[4:21:48] <+Mikatonic> you don't know that
[4:21:50] <@Mechz71> elmo never shuts the fuck up. I know @AngriestPat
[4:21:50] <Nepsotic> With the amount of hair on pats mic you'd think he already has one
[4:21:52] <+8BitReaper> give Elmo the cam
[4:21:58] <%forevern2dust> GoPro and mic him then set him up with his own twitch channel.
[4:22:01] <$hatesdps> did he kill discount seeth yet?
[4:22:02] <filialpails> I want an alternate audio stream that is ONLY elmo

[4:22:27] <Tampaoster> UPGRADE BIG STICK
[4:22:27] <%XzileGaming> id rather have an Elmo GoPro cam
[4:22:28] <%commanderclaw> Get dat STR to 60
[4:22:30] <+SirFailsAlott> sipsipDab
[4:22:31] <eco419> bone
[4:22:36] <+SirFailsAlott> hey all
[4:22:45] <grayjammer> @AngriestPat Thanks for streaming today. Needed something Souls-y in the background while I draw fanart of the Adjudicator from DeS
[4:22:50] <Nepsotic> Pat lives in quiet fear of elmos greatness. he keeps him down
[4:22:55] <voyagerwitch> @hatesdps i imagine so, since we saw him in the dark shrine place iirc
[4:22:55] <@Mechz71> Elmo likes to walk right up to the mic and yell at it over and over and over and over again
[4:22:55] <AllJoeShow> giving elmo a mike would be bad... bad for you... like, "ok guys the experiment is over... this is now a Elmo the cat channel.. its something we can all get behind"
[4:23:10] <JoeNeutrino> Isn't 60 excessive? It's practically pointless to go above 50
[4:23:11] <$Mornaka> Thick Turgidpole
[4:23:16] <grayjammer> The whole boss
[4:23:18] <Coystick> Ajudicator is retro chonk
[4:23:19] <Kilagn> ah fuck how much of this strem have I missed
[4:23:22] <+Bouerd> DeS had some great boss designs
[4:23:22] <Kilagn> !uptime
[4:23:22] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 23m 24s.
[4:23:26] <Kilagn> Shieeett
[4:23:28] <Nepsotic> Can elmo at least have his own Twitter
[4:23:31] <$hatesdps> thanks voyager
[4:23:34] <%forevern2dust> Isn't Pat excessive?
[4:23:36] <%Laecerelius> He is the Old Chonk
[4:23:40] <Tampaoster> 60 IS TO USE LEDOS HAMMER
[4:23:42] <RichAnvils> put in VIG
[4:23:45] <Caidezes> You need higher stats to use a few weapons.
[4:23:51] <%commanderclaw> 60 for Ledo's hammer matters
[4:23:59] <katocrimson> LINGERING WILL
[4:23:59] <$Mornaka> Bo Jangles
[4:24:04] <$hatesdps> the hammer of jared ledo
[4:24:05] <Nepsotic> DeS did something cool and unique with each boss
[4:24:09] <Coystick> My Axefu
[4:24:10] <Pajex_> Is this boss a dark souls reference Kappa
[4:24:11] <Kalcom> Weak to ice btw
[4:24:11] <voyagerwitch> why would you want to 1-hand a hammer though?
[4:24:12] <Tampaoster> way to begin
[4:24:13] <eco419> i hate this fight
[4:24:15] <OwlLightningMage> Big strong Kreygasm
[4:24:17] <JoeNeutrino> @Tampaoster He'd be two-handing it though, wouldn't he?
[4:24:22] <+Taxerus> rip the invasion
[4:24:25] <+Taxerus> unless Pat dies
[4:24:29] <Kalcom> if you don't do it first try then why even use ice
[4:24:29] <AllJoeShow> double down on that whopping
[4:24:37] <$hatesdps> greeeeeed
[4:24:41] <%TaifuDragon> he's not gonna die
[4:24:43] <$Mornaka> Ford Tough
[4:24:45] <voyagerwitch> he thought theere was gonna be a visceral
[4:24:46] <%TaifuDragon> too many estus just traded
[4:24:48] <Nepsotic> this fight gave me the hardest time out of all of them on my first playthrough. Can pretty much flawless it now but his second phase is still a bitch
[4:24:50] <+Foobe> yo i wanna play the game as this dude
[4:24:58] <%TaifuDragon> @Foobe literally my build
[4:24:58] <+8BitReaper> use Ultra Instinct

[4:25:01] <dekkitout> god this guy looks so cool
[4:25:01] <+Dao_Puppy> Aw yes, one of the best fights. At least before the audience gets rowdy. Fucking soccer fans.
[4:25:01] <+Timesteel> @AngriestPat have you checked out Des on RPCS3 it runs great now pretty much locked 30 FPS if you have a decent cpu and are using vulcan
[4:25:06] <AllJoeShow> ouch

[4:25:14] <+Foobe> @TaifuDragon he's fuckin' MASSIVE mate
[4:25:17] <JoeNeutrino> And what are the pilgrim butterflies? It's never explained.
[4:25:19] <$hatesdps> pilgrim butterflies are fucking rad

[4:26:25] <eco419> Pat dont blew it
[4:26:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> silly pat its only 8:30pm ;3
[4:26:29] <+misterjumbles> well cuz you never killed the owner of the armor... just the armor
[4:26:33] <+Timesteel> @Nepsotic not yet RPCS3 doesn't have online yet but I imagine when it gets it you will probably be able to play yuvi's server
[4:26:43] <$hatesdps> wear the armor of your wifes dead friend thats fine i guess
[4:26:44] <$Mornaka> John Goodman
[4:26:45] <derap41> Got the FaP
[4:26:45] <+8BitReaper> no you miss it it's just Elmo wearing Pats skin
[4:26:45] <bsmusic> the rematch in the dlc was pretty hype though

[4:26:47] <%xemnahort> nah man its 11:30
[4:26:52] <majindusto> Slate Stabrock
[4:27:03] <+Dao_Puppy> I still can't get good framerate with RPCS. Is the shield still invisible too?
[4:27:06] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> i didn't much care for fighting a regular version of him in that dlc
[4:27:07] <Nepsotic> @misterjumbles Well the armor is reanimated in the DLC due to the "memory of the hunt" or some stupid bullshit
[4:27:23] <majindusto> Brick HardMeat
[4:27:26] <$Mornaka> Chuck Hardface
[4:27:27] <Jbandy5050> yeah well its 11:30 on the CORRECT COAST

[4:27:41] <+Timesteel> @Dao_Puppy on my 2 playthroughs I've only seen it happen once with crestfallen warrior but that was it
[4:27:44] <%forevern2dust> greedy

[4:30:05] <Baconrath> aww i missed all the video game crimes
[4:30:08] <+Stereotreme> I just hate the Bamco screen. "here's a bright white logo screen after your eyes have been adjusted to darkness for a 6 hour play session!"
[4:30:09] <+AXL808> that's what Fallout 76 players have been asking for all along
[4:30:12] <Coystick> gg
[4:30:13] <Nepsotic> seeya pat, I'm giving up on trying to invade you, peace
[4:30:15] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> you should play around with some of the DLC weapons again when you get there. you missed psrts of their movesets in the lp
[4:30:18] <derap41> Seen the massive grind fest reddead online 2 is turning into?
[4:30:19] <CheekyBirb> i just alt+f4 after clicking quit game and it saves
[4:30:25] <%forevern2dust> zoneZT archives?
[4:30:27] <DracaenaLeaf> Because it's weird I guess.
[4:30:32] <moogleboy1984> Thanks for the stream, I was able to get all my Fieldking gear
[4:30:33] <OwlLightningMage> Shit gets way worse
[4:30:36] <grayjammer> Candlehead's funny with a chunky build like yours
[4:30:42] <%PenmanLupine> boy I can't care about HxH in the slightest
[4:30:43] <bsmusic> WutFace
[4:30:44] <HyperBomb21> GG Thanks for the stream!
[4:30:53] <OwlLightningMage> SECOND DREAM Kreygasm
[4:30:58] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Oh I jus noticeD I have an Elmo Icon, I am so happy :3
[4:31:01] <Nepsotic> i really like the candlehead enemy designs tbh, it's creepy
[4:31:01] <%FrostMass22> The genocide ants aren't the worst thing ever? what the fuck?
[4:31:03] <SailingSaturn> Don't trust Ranks, Yu Yu Hakusho also had ranks and it was stupid cirBaka
[4:31:03] <%forevern2dust> @PenmanLupine you are wrong
[4:31:10] <+Stereotreme> if you monkey paw the ants, you'll get wasps
[4:31:16] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> helldivers is great
[4:31:17] <OwlLightningMage> Yu Yu Hakusho did the same thing
[4:31:18] <Tampaoster> i started warframe too, just begun forging my rhino frame
[4:31:19] <%TaifuDragon> Helldivers is on steam, it's a top down shooter
[4:31:25] <%TaifuDragon> it's neat but man it gets samey
[4:31:28] <%PenmanLupine> @forevern2dust I actually can't be wrong because its my objective fact that I can't care about HxH
[4:31:29] <SeventyForce> @AngriestPat It's on Steam, basically troopers VS all 90's aliens
[4:31:33] <majindusto> So...The PlayStation Classic appears to be a piece of shit...Glad i decided not to get one
[4:31:36] <%AncelDeLambert> got your scans, right?
[4:31:37] <TURBOSUPLEX3000> it has some fun coop elements
[4:31:38] <voyagerwitch> i mean they kind of monkey paw'd the ants, if you consider the monkey paw to be a metaphor for something else
[4:31:43] <%AncelDeLambert> don't do Inaros without them scans
[4:31:43] <%XzileGaming> cheats
[4:31:45] <%forevern2dust> @PenmanLupine wrong again. See me after class
[4:31:46] <$Mornaka> @majindusto good duel, have a good night
[4:31:46] <Nepsotic> I'm gonna have to check out warframe. People said it's free on switch right?
[4:31:47] <TheMilhouseExperience> Okay.
[4:31:49] <%Svanyr> fuck i need to sleep
