[0:14:42] <Profmcstevie> I pasta the pizza, I bork the stream
[0:14:46] <%TheHateFish> @nabs96 Nah, it's running fine for me - might be worth checking your ISP.
[0:14:51] <$Futurecity10> STORMBLOOD SUCKS
[0:14:53] <%TheHateFish> Unless that was a time loop joke
[0:14:54] <%Bailey__gaming> I saw the shining two with obi wan
[0:14:54] <%deviljhojho_> the true stormblood experience
[0:14:54] <%baronblank> stormblood in a nutshell
[0:15:01] <T_Sasquatch> Stormblood has the best gameplay shut up
[0:15:02] <%Agami23> half of stormblood is good
[0:15:03] <$Futurecity10> ARR IS BETTER THAN STORMBLOOD
[0:15:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Bailey__gaming How was it?
[0:15:06] <nabs96> Yeah I'll try refreshing. sorry about the disturbance!
[0:15:07] <MarylandJutsu> BUT it DOES setup Shadowbringers
[0:15:07] <HypoNegative> Bruh
[0:15:08] <+MTLxSpider> stormblood is weird
[0:15:08] <%maskofmichael> Cheer500 Dumb hypothetical, but how different would their respective series be if Jotaro and Shinji switched shows?
[0:15:09] <MarylandJutsu> which is good
[0:15:10] <Profmcstevie> High bar to beat
[0:15:11] <+MTLxSpider> thats it
[0:15:13] <MarylandJutsu> @Futurecity10 disagree
[0:15:15] <%VictorVonLouche> just lyse
[0:15:15] <EternalJedi> Stormblood was solid
[0:15:17] <%TheHateFish> Stormblood - "Not as good as Heavensward, but that Steppe tho"
[0:15:18] <%Monkeyweed21> its an 8 intsead of a 9
[0:15:18] <@TheYellowcouch> Stormblood story is wack but hte characters are great
[0:15:22] <%baronblank> stormblood is decent but it's sandwiched between such good expansions it feels worse
[0:15:23] <MarylandJutsu> Gief doing CRIMES
[0:15:24] <+cascadepersona> Stormblood has cool raids and gameplay content, story... not so much. I like Yugiri though
[0:15:27] <nabs96> haha no not a timeloop joke I think my net is just being bad
[0:15:27] <%GalacticaPhanto> Stormblood is good, y'all just babies
[0:15:34] <%Wallabri> SingsNote Storm of Blood, Born of Blood, not as good as Heavensward! SingsNote
[0:15:34] <%Treuan> I'm just starting Stormblood now
[0:15:35] <Tyonidus> dude WHY did they make aether currents a thing? It legitimately makes me want to not even play
[0:15:36] <$Futurecity10> The only good part of stormblood is like 4.50
[0:15:37] <%KeiganOfAstora> This damn dog lol
[0:15:37] <%VictorVonLouche> cut lyse and its all good lol
[0:15:42] <HypoNegative> What da dawg dewin

[0:16:30] <@MistyMntns> Tounge goes blep
[0:16:30] <ExpressNode> Orff
[0:16:30] <+BigCoffee> Stormblood is a solid 8 with a lot of 9 moments coming off the 9/10 expac with 11/10 moments
[0:16:31] <%BlackIronVengarl> But Zenos tho
[0:16:32] <%Agami23> he thinks you're lonely because your talking to yourself
[0:16:32] <%VictorVonLouche> it's warm and smelly of treats
[0:16:32] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt He's mimicking you

[0:16:54] <%Monkeyweed21> @Tyonidus there needs to be something that prevents the player from just flying over every zone from the start, WoW does an endgame rep grind thats way worse
[0:16:55] <MarylandJutsu> Pat do big magic
[0:16:58] <%baronblank> reasonable
[0:16:58] <$Futurecity10> Dragonborn Paladin
[0:16:59] <stantheman_97> probably because you sit there all the time and he knows he gets attention when he does
[0:16:59] <%Agami23> but what type of mage??
[0:17:01] <%Ipsenscastle> Alf mage
[0:17:02] <%brisk_dacat> came in time to see baby get treay yay

[0:17:08] <%YakumoYomi> Why an elf, though?
[0:17:10] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt A gnome that knows mage hand can fly
[0:17:10] <nabs96> PLAY DND W PAIGE AND ELI AND CLEMPS
[0:17:11] <%KeiganOfAstora> But you never play magic in Dark Souls
[0:17:11] <+OrangeMDT> Does Zangief believe in God?
[0:17:12] <%thbluewarden> lol
[0:17:12] <tanarath> Pat, get with friends & play in 5e or Spelljammer.
[0:17:12] <DianaTheAscian> Pat with Elf ears is a cursed image to me

[0:19:52] <%KeiganOfAstora> Oh god
[0:19:53] <Mattais88> Jotaro would have let the city die in episode 1
[0:19:54] <nabs96> he would've killed Gendo
[0:19:55] <%GabeSweetMan> And then he'd punch the controls.
[0:19:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> Jotaro would win

[0:20:14] <+luketrapwalker> Now, Joseph on the other hand...l;
[0:20:15] <%JoshManVGH> Shinji is a regular 16 year old boy. He would get crushed by 16 year old Jotaro.
[0:20:17] <Jrocy247> Jotaro would just be confused
[0:20:17] <+armormog> he'd have his stand take the suit over or something cool

[2:10:48] <%MisterRockett> @SoFarFetched There's no way killing the wife is part of the solution and he FOUND the solution and just needs to do it faster.
[2:10:48] <AoG_JarlRaven> At least we confused him :)
[2:10:49] <rustybuckethead21> "at least that is getting easier" that is not something good

[2:11:11] <%GalacticaPhanto> I wonder if there's actually multiple endings

[2:11:23] <%cooldude69xx> @SoFarFetched Wife kill hasnt done anything yet
[2:11:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> Door is faster, knife means longer death animation
[2:11:23] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> kill the deserts
[2:11:24] <Ethel9727> What if you were stuck in a time loop and killed yourself repeatedly and destroyed your survival instinct so when you got out of it everything became super dangerous
[2:11:25] <Djinnazz> hmm...
[2:11:26] <%Questiy> The goblins have made this stream turn from great to amazing
[2:11:26] <%megadblitz> kill the desert
[2:11:29] <%ChrisPlaysThing> is it chase her out, set up trap, hide, talk?
[2:11:29] <ll_J_A_C_K_ll> and cuff the dishes
[2:11:29] <+AriaMeloetta> Out if curiosity pat have you watched ReZero

[2:11:34] <+RAWPowerStudios> I can confirm there is more than 1 ending.
[2:11:35] <masterfire23> @galacticaphanto yeah there are
[2:11:35] <%GalacticaPhanto> @valdorick He tried, he got boned I think
[2:11:39] <%WhereIsWill> wonder how many achievements you can get from this
[2:11:42] <+darthvader438> 2 stab a mofo
[2:11:43] <%XzileGaming> Paige wouldve murdered the wife before the game started
[2:11:45] <%sporeian94> I think you gotta go non-violence totally
[2:11:50] <+Vigonept> a dead end is why maybe
[2:11:50] <%Valdorick> I mean, when the guy is knocked out.
[2:11:54] <%Ziegsy> gigaboOtsMJOW3
[2:11:54] <%MisterRockett> Why would you need to get the cuffs off you've found a way to avoid being cuffed entierly??????????????????
[2:11:55] <%toastybites> @mr_saturday93 i dunno man killing your wife and then trying to prove her innocence afterwards is pretty up there
[2:11:57] <Mattais88> Dat Ass
[2:11:57] <+D00msDayDan> i think it's a red herring, i beat the game and never managed to break free and do anything after
[2:11:59] <richmon__> maybe now hide the watch in the room?
[2:12:01] <rustybuckethead21> you wait for her to get cuffed, then wait for him to get shocked and cuff him too?
[2:12:02] <%Schrodingers_Box> Why not get her KO'd by switch so she dan wake up with detective KO?
[2:12:04] <+Delenay> what if you drug yourself?
[2:12:04] <%JohnAtDawn> WHat year is this game? No tv or anything
[2:12:07] <%Valdorick> Oh right, light on the bedroom isn't off either.
[2:12:08] <%athuramn> it's to show you that if you cuff him and leave the perp with the knife, he can get rid of it himself @patstaresat
[2:12:14] <sadboy_otoroshi> Paige should find this very concerning, she's a wife after all.
[2:12:15] <@SoFarFetched> @MisterRockett I mean its also Pat Kappa its why I assume killing the wife is just faster for him to question the guy. Cause he probably got impatient drugging the wife to question the guy.
[2:12:16] <%Wallabri> is she humming Frere Jacques
[2:12:16] <+Delenay> and just sleep through it all
[2:12:20] <%ElkRiverDog> Is she humming "Are You Sleeping"?
[2:12:21] <arkv01> hello wife my present to you is this knife
[2:12:21] <+fetrigon> @d00msdaydan stfu
[2:12:29] <Jrocy247> @JohnAtDawn That's what I was saying

[2:22:25] <trianglehat> polaroid, she's innocent
[2:22:25] <$Teh_Un> Forgive her
[2:22:25] <+RAWPowerStudios> There's something you're forgetting about that has it's own branch.
[2:22:32] <%Valdorick> Pat "I have a cunning plan" Orangeaddler
[2:22:39] <Lajong_z> chat listen to the song shes humming next loop LUL

[2:24:09] <%athuramn> lol imagine if every kid who got beat just pulled a gun out LUL
[2:24:12] <@SoFarFetched> I think he had fewer choices because he already asked them in the other ones.
[2:24:13] <akitanito> just kiss
[2:24:15] <@SoFarFetched> so now his character has the knowledge
[2:24:16] <mr_saturday93> You think she know the nannys name?

[2:37:37] <%Valdorick> This is a very one guy game...
[2:37:41] <%MisterRockett> Might not have to stab him this time.
[2:37:42] <Fluffy_Tamamo> @Fluffy_Tamamo Works for me veiShrug
[2:37:44] <+Ricky_Rexx> man named his daugther bumblebee? lol
[2:37:45] <+Fep3> so you expect him to talk now without torture?
[2:37:46] <%michingmallecho> Heeey bumblebee
[2:37:47] <%toastybites> what if you stab wife after you tie up the cop
[2:37:52] <Dudeakoff> NotLikeThis
[2:37:52] <gamingforoneplease> Has he ever tried to drug the wife yet?
[2:37:52] <sadboy_otoroshi> Make wife run, killer gets early. Immovilize him, call bumblebee
[2:37:55] <%GabeSweetMan> Not having to stab might be useful.
[2:38:00] <Lajong_z> @0dinpen just you wait
[2:38:00] <dekkitout> @banjostevens Like real Pat would
[2:38:09] <%GabeSweetMan> He has drugged the wife on this very loop @gamingforoneplease
[2:38:09] <%SirGO0SE> smooches :D

[2:38:12] <+0dinpen> pls no more
[2:38:14] <%Ziegsy> jokes on you the daughters telling him to kill you
[2:38:14] <%Valdorick> Can't double tap wife, being knocked out is as good as being dead.
[2:38:16] <%megadblitz> what if you gave the guy some agua
[2:38:17] <Blank9> put the S on
[2:38:18] <sun312772> answer the door

[2:38:24] <Mpk674> @sadboy_otoroshi I think we tried that already
[2:38:28] <ape_hawk> answer the door
[2:38:28] <%Valdorick> Maybe leave door open so he doesn't waste you time?
[2:38:31] <+Ricky_Rexx> drug wife, then kill her?
[2:38:32] <+haitakaa> I would assume you have to prove your wife's innocence somehow
[2:38:33] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh he rang the bell that time
[2:38:36] <MiamiMemory> Can I offer you a mug in this trying time?
[2:38:39] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Instead of knocking like an ass
[2:38:46] <+Fep3> yeah maybe just go
[2:38:54] <%ospreyworks> go open
[2:38:56] <%GabeSweetMan> Oh you're right he DID ring the bell. I can't recall him doing that in other loops.
[2:38:56] <sadboy_otoroshi> @sadboy_otoroshi Not while immovilizing the killer.
[2:39:02] <akitanito> let em zap himself
[2:39:02] <+SciFiBrony> Notice that when you call the daughter, he doesn't claim to be police.

[2:43:13] <%toastybites> "The weather is pretty Omnikron today"
[2:43:14] <Estuko> @wizard_of_diamonds time resets when he leaves apartment or dies, man wants watch and kills husband and wife. Wife is involved in murder of prior owner of watch who was also dear friend of murderer.

[2:43:20] <+Fep3> call bumblebee

[2:46:36] <AoG_JarlRaven> @hitaker if you call the daughter beforehand and ask her to tell him to talk to you
[2:46:38] <alexandrecau> everyone instincts is to kill you

[3:39:43] <Louie_Salmon> Oh that's nice, now it's the peephole
[3:39:44] <+FoolsArcade> TEH CAST THO
[3:39:44] <Djinnazz> Knew that was Dafoe!
[3:39:45] <+lordericter> dang no incest
[3:39:45] <+senfood> EYYYY DAFOE
[3:39:47] <%TheReallJimbo> holy shit this is a hell of a cast!!
[3:39:47] <+VoytekBus> but 8 years of ;) time
[3:39:47] <jorniev> DELETE INCEST TIMELINE
[3:39:48] <Profmcstevie> It's a fresh game, mind not find what you want looking it up
[3:39:49] <%Faustgesicht> THE FUCK IS THIS CAST
[3:39:50] <+TheMofologist> Double homicide ending
[3:39:50] <marcomatame> WEEBS ARE DISAPPOINTED
[3:39:50] <+polothegreatest> THE WITH NO SWEET ALABAMA

[3:39:53] <%Garthunox> honestly probably the best ending
[3:39:53] <+RowenCleric> howd they get these actors , still dunno
[3:39:54] <technodribble> Wait they got Willem DaFoe?
[3:39:54] <SaltyAzteca> DEADBEAT DADS ARE NOT COOL

[3:39:55] <%ospreyworks> how does Daisy Ridley keep getting roped into stories with implied or actual incest???
[3:39:56] <alternatecoyote> I wonder if there is a murderer ending where almost everyone dies.
[3:39:56] <Saltmeisterr> DA FOE
[3:39:57] <Cynical2DD> It’s Pat and Paige mixed with Old Boy
[3:39:58] <evbites> pat get the dna test
[3:40:00] <+sp_abadidea> Damn, for a while I was like "Man that's a really good Willem Dafoe impersonator"
[3:40:00] <%megadblitz> these incest babies are bad for the universe
[3:40:02] <lazysaiyajin> beyond twelve minutes
[3:40:02] <%brisk_dacat> its at least 3 diffrent ending
[3:40:02] <reonome> this cast is fucking wild
[3:40:02] <+cascadepersona> 12 minutes is a game where you get to actively encourage or prevent incest between two individuals. Revolutionary.
[3:40:03] <%logoth_> Its nice that Willam Dafeo gets to be in a good vidieo game
[3:40:04] <sadboy_otoroshi> That's done I guess?
[3:40:06] <mangoes1> Don’t look up yet
[3:40:06] <T_Sasquatch> im sorry thats fucking dumb, he just forgot he murdered his father AND that he fucked his sister ?

[3:40:17] <%michingmallecho> So....I don't get it. It's just an everlasting loop
[3:40:19] <BlackStarAura> That damned Shining carpet, though
[3:40:19] <Lajong_z> @PatStaresAt theres after credits
[3:40:20] <+BigCoffee> Google how to get true ending

[3:40:39] <+VoytekBus> Neil bones alright
[3:40:39] <GarbageQueenEllie> @T_Sasquatch I know that sometimes trauma can repress memories, but I really doubt this case could exist

[3:45:15] <reonome> are you trapped in here forever?
[3:45:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> The watch
[3:45:16] <scrumbotime> By changing the past you made a paradox, you broke time by NOT going with her
[3:45:17] <+senfood> That explains the carpet.
[3:45:17] <%RealThiele> COWABUNGA IT IS
[3:45:18] <BlindGato> Are we in hell?
[3:45:18] <+MightyDuckShoes> Incest is Unbreakable
[3:45:19] <NobleJedi> this feels bleak
[3:45:23] <+Pharmakokinetic> King Crimson?
[3:45:24] <ThatOneNerdGuy> Can you stare at the watch?
[3:45:24] <+haitakaa> flush the watch?
[3:45:26] <jorniev> so the game just keeps going holy shit
[3:45:26] <TheBadoe> unlocked the rest of the game
[3:45:26] <+Saunt> can you leave the watch in a different vent?
[3:45:28] <%ClericOfSparda> This is a shitty apartment building if that hallway leads to exactly one door
[3:45:29] <%Broand> I'm confused
[3:45:29] <stantheman_97> you must fuck sister wife
[3:45:30] <RaidenRising> BITES ZA DUSTO
[3:45:33] <%InternetShis> This really is just Mandom

[3:45:36] <artificiallynatural> this is awfully bleak for the avoided incest ending
[3:45:36] <KaiserMario> WHAT NOW PAT, Guess this ending! LUL
[3:45:37] <marcomatame> ENTER THE OPINION
[3:45:38] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt that's the "alone" ending, you're alone and that's it.

[3:45:48] <+Ropcord> LUL
[3:45:48] <%dawarw0lf> Is this just an ending?
[3:45:50] <%RealThiele> the opinion zone
[3:45:51] <mangoes1> It’s impossible unless you payed close attention, but you need to move the hand to 58
[3:45:51] <%Garthunox> You will never reach the truth
[3:45:53] <%athuramn> @patstaresat interact with the watch
[3:45:53] <kingra> YOU WILL NEVER FIND THE TRUTH
[3:45:53] <+chippracoon> have you try waiting or messing with the time?
[3:45:54] <Ethel9727> Breaking up with your sister is the bad ending confirmed?
[3:45:55] <%InternetShis> Cringe Internet Explosion Opinion
[3:45:55] <Jrocy247> Flush it?
