[0:39:55] <Captain_matt> @QueequegTheater for Castlevania? Symphony of the Night
[0:39:55] <+r_squared1672> @skyentombment these models aren't super well detailed, it's the shading primarily that makes them look good, that's why their file size is super small. It's entirely possible to put costumes in the game, but they'd essentially have to create a whole new character model, and figure out how to apply shading on each move. a character skin would be almost the same amount of effort as a new character entirely.
[0:39:59] <%aBlueWizard> Makes me sad because she's been my favorite in every game, only GG character i have a model of that sits above my desk.
[0:40:00] <Sotetsu> @Emaruse How many are there actually?

[0:51:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh no, He's all the other characters
[0:51:19] <agadejobi> So when Ky and Dizzy are making with the romance....does he have to please one person or three?

[0:51:42] <gryffinp> to feast
[0:51:42] <BluBox> Nago has the same issue, it's probably the limited movement that makes it tough

[0:51:48] <crunchum> lol
[0:51:48] <%HitchhikingThrough> I gasped

[0:51:50] <iosephe> That was a good mind read

[0:52:05] <%MysteryFish_> I'm only here because Smol Ginger got me hooked on Monster Hunter and he has to answer for his crimes, and hopefully teach me to FGC
[0:52:09] <TehMud> @gildor0 Makes sense. I only went in because I got my fixed tax return this week so had some "extra" cash
[0:52:09] <VVerewolfJones> He was to eat like five Dwayne Johnsons a day to stay that ripped
[0:52:10] <%Kiwami_gaim> @patstaresat i feel like they should have kept his dp move from xrd
[0:52:10] <gryffinp> 11-5
[0:52:10] <reddpop_> Does the audio mix sound off, or is that just on me?
[0:52:13] <$RealThiele> what was happening is somebody getting fucked
[0:52:14] <%mighty_max_t> Does anyone know if you get fishing bucks from these private matches or is it only ranked?
[0:52:15] <%Emaruse> Potemkin HAD better options, but the last Beta basically killed some of the major ones
[0:52:15] <porkued> FRAUD DETECTED
[0:52:20] <+forgetme000> i wounder how they will simplify jack-o
[0:52:21] <Ipsenscastle> what is this boat cathedral in the background wow
[0:52:21] <%the22cstomp> slugfest
[0:52:23] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt is it just because of  Potemkin cause the TTK seems pretty fast?
[0:52:24] <+johnnychopsocky> "Look how nice and pretty and smooth our game is, no locals needed!"
[0:52:26] <televisedrevolting> @vverewolfjones He consumes four full-sized horses
[0:52:28] <%Emaruse> He still works though, oddly enough
[0:52:28] <%nanaki_ff14> Can you set Rollback Frames or is it autoadjusted?
[0:52:30] <TheOpinionater> FRAUD
[0:52:34] <+neoexogene> @patstaresat can’t connect to the room at all, that sucks

[0:52:51] <%Monkeyweed21> 2P needs to be 3 frames
[0:52:53] <VVerewolfJones> :D
[0:52:53] <Darlos9D> I don't really stream though
[0:52:56] <TheNewJapanGuy> But he's a tank Pat
[0:52:57] <gryffinp> you say "only" like having a fast standing jab doesn't bump a character up two tiers on its own
[0:52:57] <$metzselaar> Room has max 9 folks.
[0:52:58] <%Emaruse> If he only gets one change, let it be that
[0:52:59] <%trustycoyote> Didn't it use to be?
[0:53:00] <%Monkeyweed21> he needs 1 3-frame jab
[0:53:02] <+OniOniOniiii> stand jab was great in beta 1
[0:53:02] <+Man_in_the_Red> either vacuum 2S or jab into... anything

[0:53:20] <%MysteryFish_> These fucking mirror matches
[0:53:20] <Ipsenscastle> and when Potemkin's not on screen, all the other characters should be asking: 'where's Potemkin?'

[0:57:31] <%depressed_skeleton> "Git good"

[0:58:10] <%jackythefrost> @Mr_JustinJones Gio unfortunatly feels mildly unfinished, her only way of getting in is very unsafe, which is ass for a rushdown character
[0:58:11] <%nanaki_ff14> Pat is pro White Ram let it be known!
[0:58:15] <%makouzer> @PatStaresAt you can burst it as soon as you see the fist, its pretty slow
[0:58:15] <extradopeness> the pot theme is great but the verse vocals are way too funny

[0:58:57] <%Emaruse> @jackythefrost To me, she DOES feel unfinished on one hand, on the other hand, she plays way too honest for a guilty gear character

[1:15:18] <%DianaTheAscian> FIRST NAGO TONIGHT
[1:15:19] <+NecDW4> WAIT, Nago is LEGIT the boss character?
[1:15:19] <%Ninestempest> @chat does anyone know how much nago got changed since last beta?
[1:15:20] <+NecDW4> LUL
[1:15:21] <+cascadepersona> AGAIN

[1:15:23] <Saltmeisterr> LEO THEME
[1:15:25] <krin_x> nago is good but not that god
[1:15:28] <%nanaki_ff14> LETS GO NAGO!
[1:15:28] <thelonechris> I can't believe Woolie's parents based him on this character
[1:15:32] <OldManDeckardCain> nago is literally a kotal/necalli function in the story, he is there to get his ass kicked LUL
[1:15:33] <+Man_in_the_Red> times never change
[1:15:34] <%nevan_44> SourPls
[1:15:35] <bonebagMEL> ouchies
[1:15:37] <LoneFonte> @NecDW4 for the Arcade mode, yeah
[1:15:38] <krin_x> also nago aint the boss
[1:15:41] <+Afterman_> megafisdto
[1:15:41] <destinyspider> Which boss characters did Woolie use to pick beforehand?
[1:15:43] <gryffinp> I've seen some ferocious nagos, I think he's a real character
[1:15:43] <%nanaki_ff14> Did they fix blood gauge?
[1:15:44] <tolloponik> oh wow a Nago
[1:15:45] <%McSoliace> he's the boss in the arcade mode
[1:15:45] <+TheBitingIrish> rip
[1:15:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> TRUE
[1:15:46] <$SGrim> ...and die?
[1:15:47] <+wizard_of_diamonds> RIP
[1:15:48] <Blackscience91> Nago is a canonical Weeb it's kind of amazing.
[1:15:49] <%Emaruse> I think they'll have a Final Boss Character, like old school Guilty Gear later on though
[1:15:49] <Saltmeisterr> @OldManDeckardCain AGAIN?
[1:15:50] <%Agami23> thats fucking cool
[1:15:51] <GilliamYaeger> He super is the boss character
[1:15:51] <%DianaTheAscian> HOLY HIT
[1:15:52] <+FlongBongle> Destroyed
[1:15:52] <dabeaminator> Have they fixed Nago's blood speed since Beta 2?
[1:15:53] <+fetrigon> @oldmandeckardcain no spoilers
[1:15:55] <RaidenRising> yeet
[1:15:59] <televisedrevolting> I heard Nago is pretty Feast or Famine? Is that accurate?
[1:16:00] <%Emaruse> Nago got buffed
[1:16:00] <JayEarly> yo this Nago got style
[1:16:01] <gildor0> yeah he got some buffs
[1:16:02] <tolloponik> good good
[1:16:02] <+Afterman_> is nago good now
[1:16:02] <%HitchhikingThrough> how'd that work out for you?
[1:16:05] <OldManDeckardCain> nago is cool tho unlike kotal
[1:16:07] <+NecDW4> @LoneFonte LOL nice. And here i thought he was just going to be my Baiken holdover
[1:16:08] <%AncelDeLambert> time to CHEEEEEEESE!
[1:16:09] <%HitchhikingThrough> No they didn't
[1:16:11] <bonebagMEL> Woolie will say he's not fiex
[1:16:12] <LoneFonte> Boss Nago can use all his moves even in blood mode LUL
[1:16:14] <%HitchhikingThrough> I was watching a stream earlier
[1:16:14] <%Emaruse> For Starters, you CAN control his blood gauge now
[1:16:15] <Rilogator> props to woolie for playing a hard character
[1:16:15] <%Ninestempest> @destinyspider in every fisticuffs he's usually picked bosses lol
[1:16:18] <Aydarkzero> yo nago fucks monkaS
[1:16:18] <+archangel9889> Did they fix him ore are you just bad Pat?
[1:16:19] <%AncelDeLambert> if combo does not work, CHEAT
[1:16:19] <%HitchhikingThrough> That blood meter good god
[1:16:22] <+Afterman_> hmm if nago got buffed i might play him instead of sol
[1:16:24] <zashzila> I hope Woolie is okay.
[1:16:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> NO
[1:16:26] <tolloponik> wow he can do more than 3 things now
[1:16:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> He wont
[1:16:28] <bendatron> That combo in beta 2 would have sent him into blood rage
[1:16:32] <+ThunderZebraKing> How could woolie do this D:
[1:16:33] <+neoexogene> Boss Nago is fucking impossible
[1:16:33] <%AncelDeLambert> and dead
[1:16:33] <Iam_Dead> idk if it's just boss nago, but he can do rekka rekka grab
[1:16:34] <extradopeness> max fighting the AI Nago from last nights stream was crazy
[1:16:43] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[1:16:43] <%asgard147> DOOT
[1:16:43] <%barkon345> what is he doing to make his blood gauge go down?
[1:16:44] <%derpy_platypus> Rules Of Nature
[1:16:44] <WhatisjuiceLive> Try doing Megafist
[1:16:47] <+Frranky> honk

[1:16:48] <%Kiwami_gaim> i wishi couldnjoin the room
[1:16:48] <+archangel9889> ?
[1:16:49] <gryffinp> even though that nago's super got blocked it was probably worth doing, that got him out of pressure well. 19-7.
[1:16:49] <DanThePumpkinman> have you considered: megafisto?
[1:16:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> RUN BACK
[1:16:50] <Aydarkzero> woolie wins in spirit form
[1:16:51] <%nanaki_ff14> Awesome combos!@
[1:16:51] <+TacticalTwerk1ng> that gave me anxiety just watching that match.
[1:16:51] <%Emaruse> Moves make it possible to decrease it, his Blood Dash cost is dramatically small compared to 2nd Beta

[1:18:01] <dabeaminator> Yo chat, have there been any balance changes to Nago since the last beta?
[1:18:02] <LoneFonte> @DaCheekyOne are you using the FFZ equalizer?

[1:18:47] <extradopeness> i think pat plays GG with a pad if im not mistaken
[1:18:51] <%nanaki_ff14> @GalacticaPhanto Yeah if Pat said something they would. Most ppl here are considerate.
[1:19:04] <zashzila> I bet pat can't win if his pants are full of piss.  He's just afraid.  Afraid of pee pee pants.
[1:19:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pat needs to invest in that Off Camera Piss Bottle tech
[1:19:20] <extradopeness> i actually havent been paying attention to the cam
[1:19:21] <+KilogramHours> What is this music btw?
[1:19:24] <gryffinp> I refreshed during the break but I think it just made the audio distortions worse
[1:19:31] <%Emaruse> To put it simply, Nago 1st Beta was the best, even without his QoL, Nago 2nd Beta was Garbage on an apocalyptic scale, and Nago Early Release Feels Great
[1:19:32] <sonofthedeepsouth> Just have a catheter Pat Kappa
[1:19:38] <wolfen091> pat needs a catheter

[1:21:03] <ammobasket> you know he's got to go Go GO GORILLA
[1:21:05] <%nanaki_ff14> Return to Leo!
[1:21:07] <destinyspider> it does the same thing, but is simply infinitely easier to see
[1:21:11] <gryffinp> @ANGRA_MAlNYU that's the dark secret: leo has always been a high tech character with a dozen different tools
[1:21:12] <%Meidolaon> Yoooo, is Strive actually out already? I thought it dropped on the 11th!
[1:21:22] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> sad doot

[1:21:32] <Shade075> God this stage is giving me sonic heroes vibes
[1:21:36] <@SoFarFetched> so you gotta drop more money to play 3 days earlier
[1:21:37] <%Emaruse> Xrd Leo was a a literal KING of Unga Bunga. Now he's not even in the Top 3 when it comes to that this game
[1:21:41] <extradopeness> WHEN YOU HIT THE FDB JUST RIGHT
[1:21:51] <%Emaruse> He can work, just takes a LOT of work, especially defense
[1:21:53] <%YakumoYomi> Good shit, Pat
[1:21:56] <%kysath> kysath subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Hey Pat, as we all know that you're a bigger fan of GG than Woolie clearly is :kappa:, I was wondering if you had good suggestions for first time characters in Strive. For a reference point, I was big into playing Paul in Tekken. Keep up the good work!
[1:21:58] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That boob jiggle tho
[1:22:01] <Saltmeisterr> BTW Leo is voiced by Papa Nier in the dub

[1:22:39] <A_Classy_Gentleman> Pavlov yourself into being a scrub sub
[1:22:39] <zashzila> That sounds like a good way to get mega diabetus.

[1:23:03] <destinyspider> @jackythefrost There's definitely others that are lacking. But Chipp feels the worst because he's all around so different. And especially because he's such a slowass motherfucker now

[1:31:44] <cheapdoc> what the fuck just ahppened?
[1:31:45] <zenith0111> @nitronstreams Well it seems each big chapter he goes through another mental break. He went from Jesus Doctor, Homcidal Manic, Superhero Doctor, to yet again a psycho
[1:31:45] <+TissueBoxDan> man faust rules
[1:31:46] <tomikaze_> self destruct
[1:31:46] <gryffinp> 22-7

[1:31:55] <%Emaruse> Faust is not safe from his bombs
[1:31:59] <dabeaminator> I just want to know why Faust is suffering
[1:32:00] <Saltmeisterr> i hope Delilah is one of the DLC characters so i can actually have a main
[1:32:09] <%Emaruse> A nerf that was GREATLY appreciated by all other players
[1:32:09] <meteor530> Oh kill free win. Everytime with Nago
[1:32:10] <mak0t0yukii> Oh he killed himself LUL
[1:32:11] <tolloponik> Ky has some
[1:32:11] <$lotharrio> You showed that Faust

[1:32:14] <+BotanicMoney> It always hurts
[1:32:15] <RaidenRising> oh look its woolie
[1:32:15] <%nanaki_ff14> @BotanicMoney your great your matches have been a blast
[1:32:19] <BluBox> Yuki is snow
[1:32:20] <cheapdoc> Let's see if this nago doesn't kill himself when he bursts
[1:32:20] <%QueequegTheater> It means Japanese sword
[1:32:22] <wolfen091> I'm just gonna assume anyone playing Nago is just woolie
[1:32:28] <+ZipperHands> It's a song reference
[1:32:30] <TrashLeviathan> yuk is snow
[1:32:31] <%Monkeyweed21> falling snow
[1:32:31] <mak0t0yukii> SnowDragon
[1:32:32] <%Agami23> lingering snow
[1:32:33] <%Emaruse> It really hurts him a lot more than it used to though
[1:32:33] <destinyspider> @emaruse Idk. Chipp's triple jump doesn't exactly get him far anymore. Dash triple jump used to go full-stage. Also he can't stop aerial momentum with FDC anymore I think
[1:32:34] <+Pendragwn> LET'S COCK
[1:32:35] <@commanderclaw> @PatStaresAt It means "Lingering Snow" Yuki means snow
[1:32:36] <+BotanicMoney> @nanaki_ff14 Thanks I appreciate it
[1:32:36] <gryffinp> nagos are either woolie, or kizziekay
[1:32:37] <skyentombment> No dragons, it's not Ryu but Riyu
[1:32:38] <WolfemanMaverik> the yu is yuki
[1:32:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I think it actually means falling snow
[1:32:39] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Google says it means lingering/falling snow
[1:32:41] <zenith0111> @dabeaminator Probably the conclave since theyre the reason he became he killer in the first place

[1:33:11] <+ScrapKingKeita> @PatStaresAt It means "Remnant Snow"

[1:36:01] <destinyspider> @emaruse Yeah, hopefully. They can cut his health down even further for all I care as long as they improve him in the areas he was done so dirty in. Also I would really like him to get more consistent and stylish combo routes lol. Most of what you optimally do with Chipp is sorta lame

[1:52:38] <destinyspider> @invalid_robin Never played on Stick, but imo Guilty Gear's control scheme lends itself perfectly to pad. 4 main attack buttons, 5th being more situational (so it's on R1) and then you also have L2/L1 and R2 left if you wanna set yourself shortcuts for shit
[1:52:38] <Moiseivitch> I am the strongest

[1:53:21] <zenith0111> He went straight for the overhead rekka
[1:53:21] <jolene_orenji> ironic that a character named chipp can't handle blocking

[1:58:41] <+ryuguitarfreak> Goddamn PS5 loads so fast
[1:58:42] <%TheGreatSunbro> @Monkeyweed21 Anything fucking filled with knight shit gets overtaken by it. For Honor did too
[1:58:42] <+Qsmash_> those fucking nerds
[1:58:42] <BluBox> elaStare
[1:58:43] <+polchurgyst> yeah its actually really bad in mordhau

[1:58:44] <%Chichen> mordhau had it bad
[1:58:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> NotLikeThis
[1:58:46] <+SilverDevilfish> Remember chat, most of the Crusades failed
[1:58:47] <+NecDW4> More Nagos need to learn you can 214HS, into RC, then 623S while theyre in air
[1:58:47] <+Axle13j> TOTSUGEKIIII
[1:58:47] <+CookieCutter007> Devs wouldn't moderate the game too
[1:58:47] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @destinyspider But hear this. Ninja
[1:58:50] <+snickers_md> medieval game = racists
[1:58:51] <+Wight_Trash> cant have cool medieval shit without fuckhead nazis showing up
[1:58:52] <%Daxalog> It happens with medievil games. And military stuff.
[1:58:55] <thetunnelhomer> This is why all medieval games need to have playable women in them. It's like neo-nazi repellent.
[1:58:55] <+Double_negative> All historical games have the same problem.
[1:58:55] <Saltmeisterr> TOTSUGEKI
[1:58:55] <+imkino_> TOTSUGEKI 🐬
[1:59:01] <Sapphire_Breeze> TOTSUGEKI 🐬
[1:59:03] <+Das_Prints> The Mordhau devs also handled that problem really poorly iirc.
[1:59:05] <kinggum41> imagine fighting game voice chat
[1:59:06] <%Dr_DangerPhD> @NecDW4 that's a waste of RC honestly
[1:59:07] <%nanaki_ff14> No don't kill May!!!!

[1:59:14] <Pookiedaexzile> MayRilla
[1:59:14] <gryffinp> Is this one of those things where one channel made one video and now people freak out and denounce the game
[1:59:14] <+Frranky> yeah the crusades is just an endless series of white people getting their shit pushed in I don't know why nazis love it so much
[1:59:14] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> The dolhpin LUL
[1:59:16] <pitabears> TOTSUGEKI
[1:59:16] <Zombrocom> Good blood management is pretty key to playing nago
[1:59:17] <%furiousfurioso> well Mordhau's dev team did next to NOTHING to fight that shit

[2:01:02] <destinyspider> @alteisenreisez Yeah I know, Ninjas are great. But currently the only reason I wanna play Chipp over Millia is just because I like the character more, not because he's actually more fun.. Is your name german btw or am I dumb?

[2:01:39] <+Das_Prints> @chichen Hell yeah Continuation makes that class just a dps disguised as a tank.

[2:02:07] <+Cuon_Alpinus> use your meter pat
[2:02:08] <zenith0111> I know May was young enough to be a child to be adopted by Johnny so 30+ is stretching it
[2:02:09] <jubejube56> Ah yes the potemkin zoning
[2:02:12] <skyentombment> PAT YOU HAVE TO RQ LIKE A BIG MAN

[2:02:41] <%Monkeyweed21> May REALLY wants to fuck a guy twice her age and Johnny just goes nah bro
[2:02:42] <zenith0111> You can flick all projectiles super or not
[2:02:43] <%Ninestempest> why is pat out of breath
[2:02:46] <Pookiedaexzile> This has been confirmed
[2:02:49] <Halospaz117> I think may was supposed to be 22 in Xrd, which was like 5-6 years after 1-XX, so for those first few games she was probably like 16-17
[2:02:53] <+Das_Prints> @forlorncarton use mitigation, make sure to keep the boss facing away from your team, and don’t move it around too much so your dps can do positional easily.
[2:02:58] <gryffinp> @zenith0111 legally adopted or just put on his pirate ship

[2:18:38] <ReFallin> this game makes me so happy that more devs are using/going to use rollback
[2:18:42] <NitronStreams> can we start a revolution to replace number notation with emojis? ⬆️↗️➡️↘️⬇️↙️⬅️↖️
[2:18:43] <+scratchmesilly> 6 p is also good tho
[2:18:48] <ハクア> the unga bunga button for sol is S
[2:18:49] <PhiZeroOne> isn't 5k 3 frames
[2:18:52] <Zombrocom> Sols 6P is kinda bad in this game NGL

[2:19:04] <ハクア> yeah, 5K is back to 3f startup
[2:19:06] <SMuffinMan> @toptierharley Aaayyy pndAb pndAb pndAb pndAb

[2:19:38] <Profmcstevie> counterusuuper
[2:19:47] <PhiZeroOne> definitely didn't miss 5k being that good while it wasn't
[2:19:47] <+scratchmesilly> wooof
[2:19:47] <gryffinp> 1-4
[2:19:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> gorilla
[2:19:53] <Vashido22> far Slash is the stupid button for Sol, its really good @PatStaresAt
[2:19:54] <+ghostpopelive> is pat not enjoying potemkin?
[2:19:54] <Reanimator83> Good. I thought the arcade stick he's using that I also use didn't work on the ps5
[2:19:58] <ハクア> pat use sol's command grab, DP with K
[2:20:06] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @CaptainPileDriver you were the first Anji i've actually fought in strive
[2:20:08] <cheap_turbo> where the witches at
[2:20:11] <TopTierHarley> no
[2:20:14] <SaltyAzteca> He wants to try Sol @ghostpopelive
[2:20:17] <Vashido22> nono, far slash
[2:20:18] <%trustycoyote> proximity based slash
[2:20:18] <LoneFonte> no
[2:20:20] <Vaunno> @PatStaresAt proximity based 5S
[2:20:20] <destinyspider> 6s is different
[2:20:21] <Zombrocom> Far slash is plus, chain it into itself or frame trap with 6s
[2:20:21] <GenericSoda> far slash, not forward. Forward has good range, far slash is +2 on block
[2:20:21] <cheapdoc> Where the cocaine at
[2:20:21] <$realm_forge> What part of mass effect 2 is this
[2:20:22] <PhiZeroOne> slash when you're not super close
[2:20:22] <%QueequegTheater> Far slash
[2:20:22] <%Rumbutt> slash when you're not up close
[2:20:23] <%AlteisenReiseZ> It's been nothing but Ramlethals for me
[2:20:24] <Vashido22> 6S its also good tho
[2:20:25] <+Qsmash_> proximity normal
[2:20:26] <mcdirtie> 5S
[2:20:26] <Profmcstevie> Proximity
[2:20:27] <ハクア> no, slash from a distance, because there's a close version of slash
[2:20:27] <macmens> no if there far away its different
[2:20:29] <OldManDeckardCain> proximity normal
[2:20:30] <Vashido22> but I mean the far away slash
[2:20:37] <SMuffinMan> Far Slash
[2:20:38] <%heartlesshealer> is there a command list with move names? Describe the motion to pat
[2:20:42] <%CaptainPileDriver> I'm stuck on the station
[2:20:44] <%DianaTheAscian> yeah
[2:20:46] <Vashido22> yeah
[2:20:49] <Vashido22> thats the button
[2:20:49] <TopTierHarley> yes
[2:20:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> it won't let me off
[2:20:50] <Saltmeisterr> CatJAM
[2:20:51] <Vashido22> its GOOD
[2:20:52] <+scratchmesilly> no thats 6 P
[2:20:53] <TopTierHarley> that's the button
[2:20:54] <+ghostpopelive> its the only system in guilty gear i dislike
[2:20:54] <+KilogramHours> YEAH
[2:20:55] <mcdirtie> yeah and its godlike
[2:20:56] <+LordAngry> Nago has further slash
[2:20:56] <CrabStealer> SourPls
[2:21:00] <Blackscience91> Catjam
[2:21:01] <Zombrocom> Yeah that's the one it's plus on block
[2:21:06] <TopTierHarley> Scratch that nots 6P
[2:21:06] <cheap_turbo> slash used sword though
[2:21:09] <Zombrocom> @scratchmesilly That's not 6p man
[2:21:14] <TopTierHarley> once again, stop talking chat
[2:21:15] <ハクア> yeah, it's not 6p, the other guy was drunk
[2:21:20] <Blackscience91> Far Slash is plus on block great for stagger pressure
[2:21:26] <destinyspider> close Slash is the proximity normal. S when not right next to your opponent (or if you press S again after cS) is far Slash
[2:21:35] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> JESUS, THE BITE TOOK AWAY ALL THE BLOOD GAUGE
[2:21:40] <+scratchmesilly> @Zombrocom i was talking about when he DID do 6 p he did slash after
[2:21:41] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> BEAUTIFUL
[2:21:44] <PhiZeroOne> I think there's an airdash macro now?
[2:21:44] <yourliteraldog> bullshit blazzing
[2:21:58] <cheapdoc> Man, Nago is great when he doesn't go all blood crazy
[2:22:00] <TopTierHarley> he didn't do 6P after fS either
[2:22:02] <SMuffinMan> @phizeroone Yeah dash macro works in the air
[2:22:06] <Vashido22> far Slash is plus on block, its fantastic for stagger pressure
[2:22:16] <Vaunno> nago doing nago things and NOT exploding????
[2:22:17] <PhiZeroOne> ooh that's nice to hear
[2:22:17] <gryffinp> 1-5

[2:23:24] <cheapdoc> I appreciate the clarification tho
[2:23:28] <cheapdoc> thank you
[2:23:41] <yourliteraldog> Is the beta up again sick
[2:23:52] <ElementCatacle> Sol's air heavy slash is pretty solid
[2:23:53] <dancinginfernal> faust is a big boy
[2:23:54] <%baka_sugoi> IM NI
[2:23:56] <+scratchmesilly> @yourliteraldog no the games out lol

[2:24:31] <cheapdoc> You ungad your last bunga
[2:24:35] <%CaptainPileDriver> my game won't connect to the damn server
[2:24:38] <+Mahbonk> huh curious how faust super missed
[2:24:40] <%nanaki_ff14> Just a few more brain cells you need to shut off Pat
[2:24:40] <+scratchmesilly> S/L/A/S/H
[2:24:41] <ReFallin> it blows my mind that even with just wifi the games i had during the beta weren't awful.
[2:24:43] <yourliteraldog> Cool
[2:24:44] <+It_sjustjoey> Dang
[2:24:44] <ANGRA_MAlNYU> stabbyNoctuaPanic
[2:24:55] <%HitchhikingThrough> Unfortunately raw super is not always the solution to lifes problems
[2:24:58] <ハクア> you can use FD, jump away or just mash DP or 5K even when being pressured
[2:25:07] <destinyspider> @patstaresat the afro extends your vertical hitbox, so after getting afro'd basically always expect an instant overhead j.D by Faust. Get ready to block high n shit
[2:25:07] <cheapdoc> uuuuuuuuuuh a zato
[2:25:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> unless your anji
[2:25:12] <+scratchmesilly> you just gotta find the good buttons
[2:25:12] <GenericSoda> yeah that's always frustrating when you start a new game
[2:25:13] <%therustystream> Sol throw's + frames on people until you grab them
[2:25:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> raw super counter
[2:25:16] <%therustystream> that's his gameplan
[2:25:17] <+EonKain> unplug Ethernet cord it works in DBFZ
[2:25:17] <rasamune> It should be
[2:25:18] <%AzureGale> das deep
[2:25:19] <Profmcstevie> Your fallback is raw super Pat, you'll never win like that
[2:25:20] <TehMud> I'm pretty sure you're just supposed to hit all the buttons and pray.
[2:25:21] <%HitchhikingThrough> *not ALWAYS
[2:25:21] <%QueequegTheater> Then you're not doing it hard enough
[2:25:23] <@SoFarFetched> Raw into your soup...err
[2:25:25] <%HitchhikingThrough> important distinctions
[2:25:26] <ReFallin> just raw super harder
[2:25:28] <ThatManSam> Is it true you caused Woolies injury due to your prowess in hitting the back?
[2:25:30] <%AzureGale> HOW CAN MAN RAW TAG FOUR TIMES
[2:25:30] <Vaunno> halloween zato

[2:27:50] <%nanaki_ff14> Ky vs Sol!
[2:27:50] <dabeaminator> Pat’s playing Sol now?

[2:29:01] <HoldBtoRun> i do not like those Sol colors that look like Ky AT ALL LUL
[2:29:02] <cheapdoc> I saw your moves
[2:29:02] <dancinginfernal> sounds okay to me
[2:29:03] <+senfood> RETURN TO MONKE
[2:29:03] <Segartner> do you recommend getting a fight stick just for ggs?
[2:29:05] <mortificent> @yourliteraldog crossups and dashes
[2:29:07] <SolomonMcMan> YOOO
[2:29:07] <+LordAngry> Pat just exposing some balls on stream lmao
[2:29:13] <CallMeMrFahrenheit> @PatStaresAt Someone I know got a media/beta code for PC and it got rolled back last night to the most scuffed version of Strive, a pre-open beta 1 version where Potemkin would land in the intro movie without the shipping container but still do all the animations.
[2:29:13] <iosephe> alpha monke
[2:29:14] <Zombrocom> That was some unga
[2:29:16] <SMuffinMan> Gotta say I love the heat map on the results screen
[2:29:23] <+KilogramHours> NOPE
[2:29:27] <%Monkeyweed21> @Segartner use whatever you prefer
[2:29:29] <GenericSoda> @yourliteraldog that she doesn't have a traditional dash, and while her hoverdash gives her good ability to mix up, it can make her vulnerable to anti-airs if you do it without setting up first
[2:29:30] <+RobPiresLu> I am starting to learn hitbox
[2:29:30] <@SoFarFetched> Play with whatever controller you feel comfortable with for fighting games geefTux
[2:29:32] <Profmcstevie> Get stick if you like stick
[2:29:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> I see ots a wifi warrior
[2:29:42] <%AncelDeLambert> I mean, it'll save your thumb from bleeding
[2:29:43] <%nanaki_ff14> SonicFox masterd the ps4 controller
[2:29:43] <+Qsmash_> plus, you don't really want to learn stick on top of learning a new game
[2:29:43] <LorcaNomad> are lobbies still bad or nah?
[2:29:45] <SolomonMcMan> A Sol tip: punch the other guy until you win or lose
[2:29:47] <%kewlmyc> I eventually do, but I want to know how to actually play a character first
[2:29:48] <ammobasket> it's different, not exactly better
[2:29:48] <%emperordread> Hitbox 4 life
[2:29:50] <$yeknomlive> this game in particularly is very pad friendly too
[2:29:50] <%AzureGale> I love playing with sticks
[2:29:50] <krin_x> but if you do quanba obsidian is goat
[2:29:51] <ReFallin> what is the difference between the Rollback Frames and the MS numbers.
[2:29:52] <%Monkeyweed21> Top players regularly use Gamepad
[2:30:02] <+TravisSchnee> Paused and unpaused and it fixed the sound ye it was on my end
[2:30:04] <+KilogramHours> Hax$ monkaS
[2:30:07] <%BubbaRands> Get stick for fight games. Periodt
[2:30:09] <+neo_crimson> @PatStaresAt Pad vs Stick is like Auto vs Stick in cars
[2:30:12] <+Mahbonk> stick is pretty fun though
[2:30:14] <+thefistcake> I got big bad fat hands, leave me alone Pat. Hitbox 4 lyfe
[2:30:16] <CallMeMrFahrenheit> If you want to get a stick to see if you like it, I recommend getting a cheap one to fuck about with. But you will notice a big difference between a cheap stick and something like a qanba.
[2:30:17] <%Agami23> i miss playing games at my arcade, which is the only reason i want a fight stick
[2:30:18] <gryffinp> counter supers are so cool
[2:30:20] <%Monkeyweed21> I learned to play Skullgirls on M+KB
[2:30:20] <Profmcstevie> ms is ping which is distance between players, rollback is how many frames of animation might get "rollbacked" at that connection
[2:30:21] <+KilogramHours> Hax$ gonna make a manifesto of you pat. monkaS
[2:30:26] <%GarbageNirvana> From what I understand this one was made to be super accessible so I'd imagine it would be just fine to play on pad
[2:30:29] <Segartner> isn't stick easier to do quarter moves on stick than on pad or am i just bad.
[2:30:33] <SMuffinMan> Stick is good if you grew up in arcades and prefer it
[2:30:35] <CallMeMrFahrenheit> I got a qanba obsidian with crown buttons and it feels so damn good
[2:30:35] <krin_x> stick is fun but it is al prefrence
[2:30:35] <DefaultSettiings> is Sol Patguy SeemsGood
[2:30:42] <LoneFonte> @Monkeyweed21 uhhh, mouse?
[2:30:43] <krin_x> also hit box is gdlk
[2:30:44] <+JJsAdventure> they went all out on this soundtrack
[2:30:46] <+EonKain> Dark Triad Pat gang rise up
[2:30:46] <SMuffinMan> @segartner Depends. Easier on a pad for me
[2:30:53] <SolomonMcMan> This song is so good
[2:31:03] <gryffinp> I played USF4 Hugo on keyboard
[2:31:04] <CallMeMrFahrenheit> @SMuffinMan Arcades weren't really a thing in my country, just big on fighting games.
[2:31:06] <+JavaManJoJo> this song FUCKS
[2:31:10] <gryffinp> 2-7
[2:31:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> dam
[2:31:14] <LoneFonte> LOVE THE SUBHUMAN SELF SourPls
[2:31:19] <+Mahbonk> WHAT THE FUCK
[2:31:21] <Saltmeisterr> rip
[2:31:22] <destinyspider> @segartner I imagine it'll just take some getting used to either way. Do you use d-pad or the left stick?
[2:31:24] <krin_x> games now adays are made around pad
[2:31:24] <%nanaki_ff14> @CaptainPileDriver now that was an Anime finish

[2:32:29] <%nanaki_ff14> I-NO LETS GO
[2:32:30] <CrabStealer> UNGA BUNGA
[2:32:47] <GenericSoda> @Celarious Anji is kind of gimmicky in general, if you don't know what Fuujin followups do, he's going to roll you
[2:32:48] <Vaunno> best theme? monkaS
[2:32:51] <+coolthulhuu> fuck man i havent looked at any footage during the beta and these characters are just so cool
[2:32:51] <yourliteraldog> Time Traveling Guitar Witch is such a fucking strong theme,
[2:32:59] <gryffinp> my new favorite i-no fact is unfortunately still a spoiler
[2:33:10] <Vaunno> oh no
[2:33:11] <LoneFonte> story mode stuff?
[2:33:14] <+FlongBongle> For someone with a sword Sol sure barely uses it
[2:33:14] <Vaunno> spoilers
[2:33:20] <Zombrocom> 5K is amazing, except on whiff, can be dash canceled as well
[2:33:30] <destinyspider> Lmao Sol had that thing going up his ass
[2:33:33] <gryffinp> 3-7 btw
[2:33:35] <CallMeMrFahrenheit> I really wish that on the black/blue neon skin that you could just colour select the blue so you could have green, white, purple, red etc.
[2:33:36] <%the22cstomp> who needs sword when you have F I S T
[2:33:37] <LoreKeeper_Thal> rival battle time
[2:33:41] <+mister_rogers> is it really a sword tho?
[2:33:43] <Profmcstevie> It's mostly a slab of metal to use his fire bullshit with
[2:33:43] <%Agami23> all of his fire moves are the sword lol
[2:33:45] <%DianaTheAscian> OH YEAH
[2:33:49] <TheSpoonyBard27> it me
[2:33:49] <%MugenSandan> Oh Pat you NEED to see the story mode and see what Sol does with the sword
[2:33:50] <+yvngmerlin> he goes out of his way to punch with his sword hand
[2:33:55] <%depressed_skeleton> me
[2:33:58] <Vaunno> @mister_rogers it's a sword/gun/lighter
[2:34:03] <GenericSoda> Ky theme fuckin slaps
[2:34:03] <+ArmoredDeath> his sword is also a gun
[2:34:04] <@SoFarFetched> wow 3 months
[2:34:05] <cheap_turbo> he won't remember
[2:34:06] <%Ynkubus_> "sword" its more of a magic super weapon thats used as a big stick
[2:34:07] <+cafefunk> Who would Paige play based just on characters looks? @patstaresat
[2:34:07] <%nanaki_ff14> haha i hate Prime subs lol can never remember
[2:34:09] <LoneFonte> need a Ky x Sol match with the switched colors
[2:34:23] <seaechiowai> yeah! don't let chat push you around !!
[2:34:26] <+FlongBongle> The real question is who is the engineer behind all these weapons?
[2:34:27] <Oxybe> Sol is just a fire wizard who uses a sword as a medium.
[2:34:35] <+Frranky> little bummed there's no ky vs sol theme in this game
[2:34:38] <GenericSoda> @FlongBongle Sol
[2:34:40] <gryffinp> @FlongBongle sol made his own sword.
[2:34:40] <Vaunno> @FlongBongle sol, mostly
[2:34:41] <%DianaTheAscian> He uses the sword more like a brass knuckle than a sword
[2:34:48] <+Frranky> @FlongBongle sol's a scientist
[2:34:53] <NeroIscariot12> @PatStaresAt Your BnB with Sol is S>HS>QcF K
[2:34:55] <LoreKeeper_Thal> wow
[2:35:08] <cheap_turbo> I think it's hard but possible
[2:35:10] <Natsu_or_whatever> aw man you can't dragon uninstall anymore?
[2:35:11] <seaechiowai> !uptime
[2:35:11] <@Moobot> @seaechiowai I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 35m.
[2:35:12] <gryffinp> makes sense, it's sort of like a throw super right
[2:35:14] <%baka_sugoi> bandit
[2:35:19] <GenericSoda> oh wait, actually Sol's sword got customized by a dog person before Xrd so he only made the core
[2:35:19] <+CookieCutter007> LUL
[2:35:25] <+FlongBongle> Did Sol make EVERY weapon though? NotLikeThis
[2:35:25] <yourliteraldog> Using sword as  knuckle duster is pretty bad ass.
[2:35:30] <+RobPiresLu> stop thinking
[2:35:32] <%QueequegTheater> No, hitta him more
[2:35:37] <Vaunno> believe it or not, sol isn't a buff meathead, he's a buff scientist meathead that knows physics
[2:35:39] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype
[2:35:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you can RC heavy mob cemetery  though
[2:35:44] <GenericSoda> oof
[2:35:45] <LoreKeeper_Thal> i cooka da meetball
[2:35:49] <PhiZeroOne> didn't sol also make ky's sword
[2:35:50] <Profmcstevie> We call it a sword but it probably isn't sharp whatsoever
[2:35:53] <Defm551> playing on pc or console?
[2:35:54] <SMuffinMan> Fuck Ky
[2:35:56] <%nanaki_ff14> Cannon ending
[2:35:58] <huskarl_zap> Ky has the better song
[2:35:58] <+mister_rogers> losing for the sake of lore like a boss
[2:35:59] <Rilogator> You got Honest'd
[2:36:00] <yourliteraldog> he pretty
[2:36:01] <%Agami23> man ky beat the SHIT out of sol in that cutscene
[2:36:04] <Saltmeisterr> Did ky kicked sol
[2:36:04] <LoneFonte> pc isn't out yer
[2:36:06] <LoneFonte> yet*
[2:36:08] <destinyspider> Ahhhh the song eas just getting good
[2:36:10] <TheSpoonyBard27> I beat the steamer, now I am the streamer
[2:36:11] <Vaunno> did he make the thunderseal? i forget
[2:36:12] <gryffinp> I forget, is ky back to using the proper thunderseal or is it still the thing he used in strive? 3-8
[2:36:16] <%QueequegTheater> Bullshit you will
[2:36:16] <%Monkeyweed21> Ky likes taking it up the butt, thats canon
[2:36:17] <LoreKeeper_Thal> but soon enough
[2:36:24] <gryffinp> er, the thing he used in xrd
[2:36:24] <+RobPiresLu> Learn dolphin girl
[2:36:25] <destinyspider> There's one part in Ky's theme that sounds like Holy Orders
[2:36:26] <GenericSoda> Fuujin followups aren't real, just disrespect all of them except the low sweep
[2:36:28] <%DianaTheAscian> eh your doing okay
[2:36:29] <Segartner> Did they gut Potemkin?
[2:36:36] <LorcaNomad> so are the lobbies still bad or nah?

[2:37:00] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm surprised Pat's not all in on Potemkin honestly, wonder what they did to him
[2:37:11] <GenericSoda> Pot is still fine
[2:37:19] <Halospaz117> He was Potemkin earlier
[2:37:22] <Oxybe> he pot'd earlier
[2:37:23] <Rilogator> Is that Persona?
[2:37:24] <PhiZeroOne> fireseal is also slightly different I think
[2:37:24] <%TheGreatSunbro> Yall remember what the room id is?
[2:37:25] <xilmarinenx> What there are classic songs in the game?
[2:37:27] <Vaunno> @Defm551 maybe try the PS4 version in back compat?

[2:37:33] <xilmarinenx> DOES THAT MEAN THAT HOLY ORDERS IS SOMEWHERE?
[2:37:37] <SMuffinMan> @garbagenirvana They nerfed him a tiny bit and Pat backed out super hard
[2:37:39] <Profmcstevie> Gotta go fishing for songs
[2:37:40] <gryffinp> @GarbageNirvana Pat had a 32-12 run with Pot earlier but now he's trying new things
[2:37:41] <Vaunno> 5uhvci @TheGreatSunbro

[2:38:25] <gryffinp> I don't think it's literally ALL of the music but its quite a bit of the good shit, yeah
[2:38:25] <+thefistcake> What's da lobby stuff?
[2:38:28] <+Frranky> ah yes a "tactician" that's a good description of how pat plays sol
[2:38:35] <gryffinp> 5-8
[2:38:38] <%GarbageNirvana> from the sounds of it Chipp is just super garbage now so
[2:38:40] <%SveriSageAdvice> "i wanna hit it so bad!" achievement unlocked, Everlasting Thirst

[2:38:47] <ttc_lover> Can Paige come say hi?
[2:38:50] <gryffinp> or, wait ,4-8
[2:38:50] <PersonifiedTFT> The jukebox in this game basically has all the stuff the XRD Jukebox did, but now with also some XRD tracks
[2:38:52] <VAYETEAS> How good is Axl in this game, you think?
[2:38:55] <Brandon__Brando> I hate the lobby system so much
[2:39:00] <+KabaBoBaba> @baka_sugoi atpRtsd4
[2:39:01] <GenericSoda> @GarbageNirvana Chipp seems fine rn, it's way too early to be making judgement calls
[2:39:03] <gryffinp> which valentine lol (there's only one in this game I guess)
[2:39:04] <Saltmeisterr> ram?
[2:39:04] <%Xelhesia> yeyeye gio
[2:39:06] <PersonifiedTFT> @GarbageNirvana Dunno who told you that, Chipp has some wild sauce
[2:39:08] <PhiZeroOne> the junkyard 3 is pretty sick\
[2:39:14] <%GarbageNirvana> Hm
[2:39:22] <%GarbageNirvana> Did his HP get buffed from the beta?
[2:39:22] <Saltmeisterr> or happy chaos?
[2:39:24] <%baka_sugoi> @KabaBoBaba LUL
[2:39:25] <PersonifiedTFT> I assume he means Happy Chaos
[2:39:31] <%GarbageNirvana> Or is he still a glass cannon
[2:39:31] <GenericSoda> people who are making judgements/tier lists on DAY 2 OF A GAME are probably not worth listening to
[2:39:31] <ハクア> oh my god volcanic viper did like 25%
[2:39:32] <SMuffinMan> Chipp is pretty nutty. He just eats shit if you do hit him
[2:39:36] <%Tragosavich> so overall how the game so far?
[2:39:37] <SMuffinMan> But he's good
[2:39:44] <+LordAngry> I feel like Happy's design is a good enough excuse to revisit A.B.A.
[2:39:44] <SMuffinMan> Glass Cannon yes
[2:39:45] <+RobPiresLu> she looks so cool, please tell me she is not a charge character
[2:39:47] <extradopeness> ad for mcdondald
[2:39:47] <PersonifiedTFT> @GenericSoda you mean Day -3 of a game
[2:39:48] <%GarbageNirvana> So basically you can't make mistakes
[2:39:50] <destinyspider> Chipp is incredibly unfun now compared to how he used to be, which is the worst sin of all
[2:40:01] <GenericSoda> @GenericSoda it's officially out
[2:40:01] <+Haruo30> Yo we bullying Pat on GG?
[2:40:10] <GenericSoda> @RobPiresLu nope, she's sort of akin to Cammy
[2:40:21] <PhiZeroOne> genuinely thought happy was bedman on first glance
[2:40:23] <destinyspider> @smuffinman People aren't talkint about his health tho when they're saying how he kinda sucks in Strive
[2:40:24] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm gonna need to learn this game's ins and outs before I touch Chipp I think
[2:40:33] <%nanaki_ff14> @PatStaresAt which Valentine? lol Happy Choas?
[2:40:35] <gryffinp> 5-8
[2:40:40] <+Qsmash_> he really did run up dp
[2:40:50] <SMuffinMan> @destinyspider He doesn't suck tho
[2:40:51] <Vaunno> Ram?
[2:40:52] <PersonifiedTFT> Did that guy just let pat grab him after pat whiffed a DP
[2:40:52] <Profmcstevie> W is a W you can't say it's not
[2:40:56] <PersonifiedTFT> is that guy holding his stick
[2:40:56] <seaechiowai> I disagree, low tiers are not hard to figure out just from character usages alone
[2:40:56] <%baka_sugoi> SOL GUDPERSON
[2:41:06] <GenericSoda> man Sol's theme also slaps
[2:41:14] <Vaunno> Sol Kiske
[2:41:16] <%Rumbutt> It's K\Y BADGUY
[2:41:18] <+RobPiresLu> @GenericSoda Thanks
[2:41:19] <PersonifiedTFT> Ew, Ky-Sol
[2:41:21] <+cafefunk> I wonder if they only included Ramlethal so they could see the Season 1 pass with Elphelt
[2:41:26] <SMuffinMan> Where is Gief?
[2:41:31] <@SoFarFetched> KY Jelly Badguy geefSmugAF
[2:41:31] <gryffinp> @seaechiowai on some level though, rev 2 johnny was top tier but had super low usage because omito was the only one who could pilot him right
[2:41:35] <+Mcmoblin> Ky MeanDude
[2:41:43] <+Frranky> sol's theme so fucking good
[2:41:47] <PhiZeroOne> ok hmc seems like it's only really useful as a hard punish
[2:41:48] <Solidnick18> SourPls
[2:41:52] <+fetrigon> DORITOS KomodoHype
[2:41:56] <Vaunno> @cafefunk they couldn't decide between the two for base roster, so they def wanted both
[2:41:57] <Oqzar> imagine talking about tiers on day -4
[2:41:57] <PhiZeroOne> it has SO much startup and can't be cancelled into
[2:41:57] <GenericSoda> SourPls
[2:41:58] <+Mcmoblin> Sol Biske?
[2:41:58] <+DoctorDerp388> so how's the smell of the game

[2:42:16] <Oxybe> Sol Nastyfellow
[2:42:19] <Carquar> I hope Sol wins
[2:42:20] <destinyspider> @smuffinman Suck is going too far, yeah. But it's a weird combination of sorta subpar and inconsistent tools (as well as some legit trash ones), as well as him losing his speed to an insane degree compared to Millia AND YET he still has lowest health
[2:42:20] <GenericSoda> is catJAM available on this channel
[2:42:23] <GenericSoda> DAMN
[2:42:29] <%tizz86> tizz86 gifted a Tier 1 sub to SMuffinMan! They have given 436 Gift Subs in the channel!

[2:43:20] <+fetrigon> @personifiedtft stfu jesus christ
[2:43:25] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm still waiting on Bridget
[2:43:31] <destinyspider> @smuffinman The changes to Alpha Blade are super strange because they obviously attempted to mesh old alpha and teleports into one, losing the actual purposes of both in the process
[2:43:31] <%GarbageNirvana> Probably won't ever happen but
[2:43:33] <PhiZeroOne> but god I *do not care* for that UI
[2:43:34] <%SMuffinMan> Yooo thanks for the gifted sub!
[2:43:39] <PersonifiedTFT> He's literally just in a backround shot guys chill out

[2:44:11] <+l3sovikk> Oh shoot, Pat's playin' Sol!
[2:44:13] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> I'm honestly shocked that all the character themes have vocals. Daisuke actually released an album with his video game.
[2:44:18] <+RealPT1> HMC is invincible so you can go through stuff
[2:44:20] <PhiZeroOne> definitely excited to see who we get lol

[2:45:06] <+r_squared1672> Kinda hope there are instrumental tracks in the game as well. I-Nos theme with vocals is whack
[2:45:24] <Vaunno> @r_squared1672 none yet, no
[2:45:33] <gryffinp> pat's figured out the sol meta
[2:45:40] <Vaunno> for strive ost at least
[2:45:44] <%SMuffinMan> Anyway, who was I talking about Chipp with? Yeah he's not top 3 or anything I agree. Just don't think he's trash.
[2:45:44] <+l3sovikk> Pat not enjoying Potempkin?
[2:45:48] <%traximus_s> oh cool I got a gift sub psaDab

[2:46:52] <seaechiowai> different unga from the usual bunga, if you will
[2:46:52] <Oxybe> a world without patemkin is one i don't want to imagine
[2:46:58] <+Frranky> got his ass
[2:46:59] <GenericSoda> nicely done

[2:47:05] <%StormBuster24> Nice
[2:47:05] <ElementCatacle> that was SICK
[2:47:07] <+RobPiresLu> trophy, you beat the game
[2:47:09] <%nanaki_ff14> Trophy!
[2:47:11] <Saltmeisterr> achievo
[2:47:16] <+megaman_sentinel> did a trophy just pop
[2:47:16] <gryffinp> 6 to 9
[2:47:30] <Rawbone_saw> hmm
[2:47:31] <PersonifiedTFT> @Profmcstevie thats literally all of twitch chat, go to any streamers chat if they're not playing the game they play every day and people will ask why they quit that game
[2:47:36] <Saltmeisterr> after bandit bringer
[2:47:37] <+r_squared1672> Bandit revolver > RRC > Gunflame > Fafnir
[2:47:40] <ハクア> after bandit revolver
[2:47:41] <+neo_crimson> After revolver? Into dust?
[2:47:41] <+BotanicMoney> After bandit revolver
[2:47:41] <%emperordread> Who is Roman and why are we cancelling him? Kappa
[2:47:47] <%baka_sugoi> opportunities
[2:47:47] <+r_squared1672> Bandti bringer yeah
[2:47:48] <+DeaconBluesClues> @PatStaresAt isn't the traditional thing to roman cancel gunflame into pressure
[2:47:49] <+l3sovikk> Sajam's got some combos up
[2:47:49] <PersonifiedTFT> Do it after bandit revolver
[2:47:49] <GenericSoda> You can Roman Cancel in the corner after a wall splat to extend wall combos to set up breaks, or you can RC after a Heavy Mob that you think might whiff
[2:47:50] <SpookyBeef7> Maybe after a Volcanic Viper or Fafnir?
[2:47:52] <Saltmeisterr> relvover i mean
[2:47:54] <Ramasama13> during night raid, rc before hit to do a grab or something
[2:47:56] <%the22cstomp> it juggles
[2:47:57] <ElementCatacle> I have seen people do vortex rc gunflame on corner to get them stuck to wall
[2:47:59] <SolomonMcMan> You can DP RC into DP I’m pretty sure
[2:48:01] <Profmcstevie> Anything that juggles is good roman setups
[2:48:01] <%Xelhesia> blue rc > gunflame
[2:48:02] <scrublord009> Anything that can lead to fafnir
[2:48:02] <%baka_sugoi> just be a BADGUY
[2:48:04] <ハクア> gunflame fafnir is corner only
[2:48:07] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean when do you normally use Roman Cancels with other characters?
[2:48:08] <mazingmax> can also drift RC, or fast RC into night raid vortex
[2:48:09] <%GarbageNirvana> Like what scenarios
[2:48:18] <%QueequegTheater> Roman made some tweets that look bad out-of-context 12 years ago, time to cancel him Kappa
[2:48:19] <PersonifiedTFT> Sajam put up a 3 minute Sol BNB video if you wanna look at that
[2:48:20] <marvel877> Pat, you sound like Charlie from Its Always Sunny.
[2:48:26] <$SGrim> Yeah, Sol! Beat your son!
[2:48:36] <+l3sovikk> Sol not have riot stamp anymore?
[2:48:41] <sir_maarkos_the_norwegian> wait this game is  out already?!
[2:48:47] <mazingmax> I think they mean night raid vortex
[2:48:47] <PersonifiedTFT> sol does not have riot stamp no
[2:48:47] <Oqzar> is the new grand viper frame 1 low profile?
[2:48:48] <NeroIscariot12> Fafnir is Half circle forward btw
[2:48:48] <Vaunno> the in-laws are fighting again...
[2:48:50] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Step Dad and Step Son Hijinks
[2:48:50] <GenericSoda> @l3sovikk nah, pour one out for Riot Stomp
[2:48:53] <ハクア> gunflame would juggle them in the corner, you just follow it up with a fafnir
[2:48:55] <scrublord009> You Roman Cancel
[2:48:56] <+Frranky> @sir_maarkos_the_norwegian out early if you got the deluxe version
[2:48:59] <Halospaz117> @SGrim he's an in-law, that makes it fine
[2:49:00] <Profmcstevie> The gunflame will catch them falling, then the fafnir will big punch
[2:49:01] <Vaunno> @sir_maarkos_the_norwegian Ultimate Edition early access for PS
[2:49:07] <destinyspider> @smuffinman Fair enough. I think calling anyone in this game trash is going too far (though there's some that are definitely better than others). It moreso just bothers me how the changes to Chipp make him less fun than his previous incarnation almost wholesale
[2:49:08] <+MasterDecoder> Oh, btw, for those that know: is the story playable or just cutscenes?
[2:49:12] <%HunguyTV> My game crashed back to ps5 os when i entered the duelstation :v
[2:49:19] <Frranky> @MasterDecoder cutscenes
[2:49:20] <+r_squared1672> Story is an anime
[2:49:22] <%nanaki_ff14> You insulted his waifu
[2:49:25] <PersonifiedTFT> @MasterDecoder its just a visual novel again unfortunately
[2:49:28] <OldManDeckardCain> story is just a few hours movie
[2:49:29] <$SGrim> @Halospaz117 In-law? More like Glass-jaw!
[2:49:30] <+neo_crimson> Yes
[2:49:35] <%Monkeyweed21> BEARING A PALE FIRE
[2:49:37] <+BotanicMoney> Full
[2:49:39] <Saltmeisterr> ye
[2:49:43] <PersonifiedTFT> why does arcsys refuse to put any actual gameplay in their story ever
[2:49:45] <PersonifiedTFT> its so frustrating
[2:49:49] <OldManDeckardCain> it's more like a movie than a visual noevl now tho
[2:49:51] <ElementCatacle> go for it after the second hit and the enemy should still be airborne
[2:49:54] <+RobPiresLu> so excited for Sol Badguy in Smash... in my head lore
[2:49:57] <mazingmax> @PatStaresAt 6k can juggle after night raid vortex
[2:50:01] <GenericSoda> in the corner Bandit Revolver should be getting wallbounces if you hit them in the air. Since Roman Cancel pops up, 5K into Bandit Revolver is a good way to set up a wallbounce
[2:50:01] <%the22cstomp> YEAHHHH
[2:50:02] <Halospaz117> @SGrim das good
[2:50:02] <gryffinp> 7-9
[2:50:03] <PhiZeroOne> we got an arcade mode?
[2:50:05] <%Deft_Thought> What does that electric field around you do when you're tagged by Ky's fireball?
[2:50:05] <Vaunno> @PersonifiedTFT arcade mode in every other GG bro
[2:50:05] <NeroIscariot12> @PatStaresAt You can Vortex/ground viper under the projectiles btw
[2:50:14] <+l3sovikk> Did riot stamp get replaced by anything?
[2:50:14] <Vaunno> ye @PhiZeroOne
[2:50:15] <TheSpoonyBard27> gg
[2:50:22] <PersonifiedTFT> I'd like to care about the GG story but i'm not pressing A for four hours straight to see it
[2:50:22] <Natsu_or_whatever> vortex is the new name ye
[2:50:24] <%TheGreatSunbro> Do you think Ky ever realizes how fucked up it was to baby-install Dizzy?
[2:50:27] <%the22cstomp> night raid vortex is the new name
[2:50:28] <gryffinp> yeah, vortex is what he says now but it was grand viper for years
[2:50:31] <+r_squared1672> Ground Vortex replaced Grand Viper
[2:50:31] <GenericSoda> @Deft_Thought makes his moves more advantageous on hit and block
[2:50:31] <NeroIscariot12> @PatStaresAt yes. The new name is Night raid vortex
[2:50:32] <ハクア> yeah it's called night raid vortex now
[2:50:32] <rodrickbarrenechea> Nitro Raid Vortex pat
[2:50:36] <PersonifiedTFT> @Vaunno arcade mode and story mode are seperate things my dude
[2:50:38] <OldManDeckardCain> the new story mode is actually pretty good, way better than xrd stories imo
[2:50:38] <+parzano> What do you think of Faust pat?
[2:50:38] <Vaunno> @PersonifiedTFT auto mode Kappa
[2:50:46] <+r_squared1672> Dash back I think
[2:50:55] <mazingmax> its the fast one isnt it?
[2:50:58] <+BotanicMoney> Back
[2:51:00] <+natedrago> red rum?
[2:51:01] <gryffinp> uh oh is this a real nago
[2:51:05] <GenericSoda> You can use either roman cancel, you would want to use a dash roman cancel if you need to adjust distance, likfe if your 5K would whiff
[2:51:09] <mazingmax> where you do gunflame as you do red rc
[2:51:13] <Profmcstevie> dash back to set up the gunflame to catch them late
[2:51:18] <Vaunno> @PersonifiedTFT sorry, thinking of Xrd episode mode
[2:51:23] <+r_squared1672> RRC Dash back Gunflame should catch them on the way down
[2:51:33] <scrublord009> End your block strings with gunflame
[2:51:55] <+fetrigon> @personifiedtft it's automatic. it's just a movie this time.
[2:52:00] <PersonifiedTFT> pat vortex is not safe
[2:52:04] <%Deft_Thought> You can 5K after that Vortex hits for a higher launch, I think
[2:52:09] <seaechiowai> pat's light bulb lit up, but what did he learn?
[2:52:12] <%Deft_Thought> Might just be on couterhit
[2:52:12] <+DeaconBluesClues> LMAO he lost all that life why exactly
[2:52:15] <huskarl_zap> jumped
[2:52:19] <+r_squared1672> It might not be safe, but when it lands it's cool
[2:52:21] <gryffinp> 7-10
[2:52:23] <$SGrim> Suicide denied
[2:52:29] <+parzano> Hey pat do you like Faust what do u think?
[2:52:37] <GenericSoda> yeah 5K, 6S, Bandit Revolver is a basic good combo. You can RC after Bandit Revolver to extend and go for wall breaks too
[2:52:37] <ハクア> you can contest nagoriyuki's rekka sequence if you block the first two hits, but just neutral jump and FD
[2:52:39] <destinyspider> @patstaresat I might be wrong, but I think after Vortex you can do 5K, then jump, j.k j.d airdash and follow it up even further
[2:52:40] <Halospaz117> I can not believe you didn't commit suicide
[2:52:44] <Profmcstevie> I will be cool and die for it
[2:52:46] <NeroIscariot12> You can PRC after viper and then grab for max mixup bs
[2:52:49] <+l3sovikk> Just raw ground viper them 5 times in a row. Always worked in XX for me.
[2:52:51] <gryffinp> B A K A

[2:53:17] <rodrickbarrenechea> Nah man when you hit NRV just do 5K 6S 235k
[2:53:17] <+BotanicMoney> That’s right you can
[2:53:17] <ElementCatacle> you can do gunflame if you rc on vortex if someone is near corner

[2:55:27] <%Monkeyweed21> Fellas, is it gay to refuse to drink cum?
[2:55:30] <Vaunno> @Frranky it is for vampires :)

[2:57:52] <+r_squared1672> @tabbymcgee That's just the private lobby, you'll eventaully be able to customize it
[2:57:56] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Calipco is just water with sugar syrup in the bottom
[2:57:57] <mazingmax> shock state makes normally unsafe special moves plus
[2:58:02] <scrublord009> Flip kick when in shock state is safe
[2:58:06] <Vaunno> @Halospaz117 only the two extremes, no in-between

[2:58:20] <OldManDeckardCain> more like "less negative" LUL
[2:58:22] <gryffinp> choji deserves to win this one
[2:58:41] <gryffinp> I don't hate may's theme but I think everything outside the chorus is boring
[2:58:44] <+SH1NK1R0> Shocked also adds more chip to his specials and his super
[2:58:45] <GenericSoda> @PersonifiedTFT you are a coward who will not survive the winter
[2:58:45] <+parzano> Pat which character has the best theme TELL US
[2:58:47] <Halospaz117> I think the cum scale might still be in beta, needs some tinkering

[3:06:17] <%captain_thickthighs> i always figured the poster caracters were for beginners anyway
[3:06:23] <TheSpoonyBard27> Yeah having never really played a GG game I picked him cause hes the closest thing this game has to a shoto
[3:06:32] <%YawnSong_> i dont care how much I get bodied in this game. I'm gonna main Gio and LIKE IT
[3:06:33] <Cici_TheMoonRabbit> BIG BLAST SONIC
[3:06:33] <rasamune> Ky's favorite cocktail is seltzer water and his favorite TV show is the news
[3:06:34] <Halospaz117> He was the first character I felt I understood back in accent core
[3:06:35] <%Deft_Thought> When's Storyteller

[3:07:10] <%Monkeyweed21> SHE GOT INSIDE HIM
[3:07:10] <+gantz_zero> she was 3 by the time they boned @PatStaresAt
[3:07:12] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Yeah, he froze her with his lightning sword...
[3:07:14] <seaechiowai> as long as he got in all 3 of dizzy
[3:07:14] <GenericSoda> yeah the lore was that Dizzy was starting to disappear from existence so he froze her to prevent her from just vanishing
[3:07:16] <%Deft_Thought> YEAH BUD
[3:07:17] <PersonifiedTFT> there isn't a Ken, if there was it would be Sol but he's closer to Terry than anything
[3:07:19] <VWVOID> shes like, teenage in Strive
[3:07:22] <scrublord009> Watch Woolie's videos Pat Kappa
[3:07:22] <+Qsmash_> she's 2 and a half
[3:07:23] <downmagic> Ky is worse than Johnny
[3:07:23] <gryffinp> 2-2
[3:07:25] <+ZipperHands> Dizzy is more so the Born Sexy Yesterday trope than the 3000 Year Old Loli trope
[3:07:25] <%TheGreatSunbro> Ky baby installed a 4 year old.
[3:07:26] <%captain_thickthighs> if she bleed she can breed
[3:07:26] <111111sagas111111> SourPls such a good soundtrack
[3:07:26] <+BotanicMoney> Yeah
[3:07:29] <%shurtal> pat said the WRONG thing
[3:07:29] <+CookieCutter007> 3000 YEARS OLD
[3:07:30] <VWVOID> shes atleast no longer literally a 3 yr old
[3:07:30] <%Deft_Thought> She's an actual child
[3:07:32] <+r_squared1672> Ky not only kicked his rivals ass, he fucked his underage daughter too
[3:07:33] <+Frranky> Gears are just meat robots it's fine
[3:07:33] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Ky likes it up the butt Xrd confirmed that
[3:07:34] <Dablackone> I thought she was 4
[3:07:36] <+Shilverow> Ky is getting cancelled on twitter
[3:07:37] <%jaggstar2020> Ky Kreepske
[3:07:38] <PersonifiedTFT> Dizzy is a tiny baby and she puts it in ky's butt
[3:07:38] <%baka_sugoi> E D G E Y
[3:07:39] <gryffinp> gasp, desaturated bois
[3:07:39] <%Agami23> man, when i see ky i cant not think of the artist kyou. because of ky's fat ass anime tiddy.
[3:07:41] <%Deft_Thought> Magicked into grown upness
[3:07:42] <MoshPitMoira> does Chris Hasen have a command grab?
[3:07:43] <%CalderGaming> Anji Alter
[3:07:47] <downmagic> oof
[3:07:48] <Zeif00> LUL
[3:07:49] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Sol is Iori + Terry Bogard
[3:07:50] <VWVOID> its like 10 yrs since GGX, i think?
[3:07:50] <%HitchhikingThrough> It's very funny that Ky is also the pope
[3:07:54] <+SinisterBroccoli> how is anji for beginners?
[3:07:54] <%Deft_Thought> This game is so fucking pretty
[3:07:55] <Halospaz117> Ky made Sol into a GILF
[3:07:58] <PhiZeroOne> at least johnny is canonically uninterested in the girls he looks after?
[3:07:59] <VWVOID> may is 26
[3:08:02] <+FlongBongle> Sussy Baka
[3:08:07] <GenericSoda> @Agami23 that's what Kyou does
[3:08:09] <PersonifiedTFT> Ky isn't the pope, he's the King
[3:08:13] <%GalacticaPhanto> Anji is so cool, I wish I was so brainless to go full UNGA with him
[3:08:13] <Saltmeisterr> @HitchhikingThrough wasn't that Ariels?
[3:08:14] <Vaunno> @hitchhikingthrough no Ariels is the pope
[3:08:20] <111111sagas111111> Has anyone perfected the anime art style in games this well?
[3:08:20] <+r_squared1672> @SinisterBroccoli He's not too bad, you can kinda spin to win. He's got a pretty simple gameplan
[3:08:24] <+TheyTookMyBeard> Try blocking
[3:08:28] <%HitchhikingThrough> oh right
[3:08:28] <%Ynkubus_> @HitchhikingThrough The pope is currently in prison
[3:08:29] <%YawnSong_> As an expert on Guilty Gear lore because I have watched Woolie's videos and that sums up all my GG experience. I can confirm Ky is also cool. Take it from me
[3:08:35] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Fujin negins
[3:08:39] <KamenRiderLeo> Yeah it's the Patster
[3:08:39] <+MonocleGrizzly> Why anji’s tiddies bounce like that?
[3:08:39] <+Zanzibar_Junker> begins
[3:08:42] <%GalacticaPhanto> @phizeroone That's because you can't be an ULTRA CHAD if you bang your crew
[3:08:43] <+SinisterBroccoli> yeah he's the character I wanna try the most
[3:08:44] <%Monkeyweed21> Johnny, the white guy with a samurai sword and cool shades, ISN'T a pedophile
[3:08:45] <%captain_thickthighs> btw is this game a reboot or sequel?
[3:08:46] <VWVOID> Ky is still a nerd tho
[3:08:47] <%HitchhikingThrough> whoop my b
[3:08:51] <televisedrevolting> @agami23 Where would I find this art of Ky's tits?
[3:08:53] <PersonifiedTFT> did woolie comment on whether or not Ky likes it in the butt?
[3:08:56] <Saltmeisterr> i literally watched all of gg lore today
[3:08:59] <Saltmeisterr> was good
[3:08:59] <GenericSoda> @SinisterBroccoli So Anji's Fuujin folowups will crush people who don't know how to deal with them, but if you use them mindlessly people who know about them will eat you alive. He takes some patience to use. He's pretty easy to pick up tho, I main him in +R
[3:09:02] <Vaunno> @monoclegrizzly so this game has something for everyone :)
[3:09:05] <clloudberry> are those buddhas going to space?
[3:09:06] <+Frranky> KY is absolutely a weenie but he's a weenie in a cool way
[3:09:10] <+pkmamsters> FOOD ARC
[3:09:10] <TJ_Timbs> @captain_thickthighs sequel
[3:09:10] <Vaunno> @captain_thickthighs sequel
[3:09:10] <Halospaz117> @Monkeyweed21 He is a dad, a subtle but important distinction
[3:09:14] <+qanonisadeathcult> the art style is so cool in this game.  Is there an anime or is it just anime style video game/
[3:09:18] <%Agami23> @televisedrevolting luciferic on twitter. the artist does alot of art of fighting game mens tiddys
[3:09:19] <+ZipperHands> Ky absolutely get's pegged
[3:09:19] <gryffinp> I just thought of a thing to say but it might be too far
[3:09:26] <scrublord009> Remember you have 6p
[3:09:26] <ShinMaxRebo> I thought it was like a soft reboot
[3:09:28] <downmagic> KY is a god damn boy scout
[3:09:29] <+MonocleGrizzly> @vaunno sounds good to me
[3:09:37] <Halospaz117> @qanonisadeathcult Just anime styled
[3:09:37] <%GalacticaPhanto> @televisedrevolting Follow Kyou on Twitter, they are godlike with man tiddies
[3:09:37] <televisedrevolting> @agami23 Thank you for the feast.
[3:09:40] <RoidRidley> He didnt stop blocking, he died to chip
[3:09:40] <Vaunno> @qanonisadeathcult just an anime style game
[3:09:45] <VWVOID> Jonny is canonically interested in "Dynamic Housewifes" magazine, so milfs, he was cool w Bridget for what its worth
[3:09:50] <%GalacticaPhanto> @agami23 Ayyy you know the truth
[3:09:52] <GenericSoda> @qanonisadeathcult it's the game's style. According to the director he's turned down a lot of collaborations (anime, TCG's) in the past but it looks like that's sort of changing as of late
[3:10:00] <gryffinp> 3-2
[3:10:01] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt don't forget to fish before u end the stream
[3:10:05] <+r_squared1672> @SinisterBroccoli You'll be fine, out of all the characters in the cast, the only ones I think might give beginners a hard time playing are I-No and Zato, maybe Chipp too.
[3:10:06] <RoidRidley> If you dont FD you can die to chip damage in this game

[3:29:19] <+Dreday543> Patempkin
[3:29:20] <downmagic> wow
[3:29:20] <PhiZeroOne> frame one kara pot buster mixup is a thing I can' stop thinking about
[3:29:21] <%SMuffinMan> GOTTEM
[3:29:25] <TenguGemini> I think the blood rage also makes nago way stronger
[3:29:25] <Saltmeisterr> noice
[3:29:28] <%baka_sugoi> BUST
[3:29:32] <%HitchhikingThrough> oof
[3:29:33] <%GalacticaPhanto> MAKE HIM HUMBLE
[3:29:37] <Zombrocom> @jorniev Nago has special to special cancels. The blood meter is meant to be a check on him to keep him from spamming
[3:29:37] <PersonifiedTFT> busta'd
[3:29:40] <Profmcstevie> blood rage is the punishment for doing his wild special move cancels, but you do get a cool super to use during it
[3:29:41] <Ardailec> @jorniev a limiter on Nago's aggression.
[3:29:45] <viewtifulr> He'll feel that in the morning
[3:29:47] <sir_nack> nago loses access to his specials, but gains ridiculous range on his normals
[3:29:50] <gryffinp> apparently nago's sword moves deal more damage if his blood gauge is high, even if it hasn't bursted yet
[3:29:52] <+gantz_zero> @jorniev it changes everything he does and is largely a deterrent but if used right it's incredibly powerful. it has a unique super that does big damage even on block
[3:29:55] <%GalacticaPhanto> oh
[3:29:55] <downmagic> @TenguGemini but it costs a ton
[3:29:57] <%SMuffinMan> @jorniev Your moves do insane damage but if you're not hitting them then it's just death yeah
[3:30:03] <sir_nack> NICE HPB
[3:30:13] <PhiZeroOne> been trying to teach myself how to hfb recently which is
[3:30:15] <PhiZeroOne> an adventure
[3:30:16] <%HitchhikingThrough> Oh man it would have been sick
[3:30:19] <+BruceyG> His sword normals also gain more range with high blood gauge
[3:30:23] <Profmcstevie> It's not a bad "get the fuck out" move for pot
[3:30:23] <PersonifiedTFT> Nago also has the option to use his command grab to bring his blood meter all the way back down, but this guy hasn't landed it once
[3:30:24] <PhiZeroOne> gotta plink those buttons at close range
[3:30:34] <$RealThiele> yea his blood sword sweep is huge
[3:30:40] <Zombrocom> He has laned grab exactly once
[3:31:00] <wolfen091> 2 fast 2 furryious
[3:31:08] <+gantz_zero> literal instant full screen
[3:31:14] <Ardailec> Twice now
[3:31:15] <PersonifiedTFT> he keeps trying to punish hammer fist with super, and it never works
[3:31:17] <%SMuffinMan> gottem
[3:31:22] <jorniev> but it leaves him so defenseless why add the health drain on top of it?
[3:31:23] <PersonifiedTFT> that's the third time he's tried
[3:31:24] <Profmcstevie> bite this you fucking casual
[3:31:27] <johnbonne_> oh man i was just watching snake eyes and he was just going off about the game nonstop it was....interesting lol
[3:31:43] <PersonifiedTFT> @jorniev its supposed to be a punishment but yeah its way too much IMO
[3:31:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @jorniev cuz fuck you and your Woolie
[3:31:45] <+unlocked2886> Who else got stuck with two Sol/Ky preorder color codes in the UE?
[3:31:55] <PhiZeroOne> so do the jellyfish' just have a fleet now
[3:32:00] <PersonifiedTFT> I think Nago should at least be able to use his command dash during blood rage
[3:32:02] <MoshPitMoira> that potemkin grab does so much damage holy shit
[3:32:03] <sir_nack> oof
[3:32:04] <+gantz_zero> because it's stupidly powerful, it's a huge risk reward built in. you can still fight without ever maxing it out if you're more careful @jorniev
[3:32:05] <Profmcstevie> air throw looks so disrespectful LUL
[3:32:13] <PersonifiedTFT> just so people can't lame him out and let him die
[3:32:14] <Mahuloq> I feel for how big and slow Potem is, he doesnt do nearly enough dmg. It just doesnt feel right
[3:32:30] <PirateMike_> didnt realise this was a fighting game
[3:32:30] <PersonifiedTFT> Potem does HUGE damage what are you talking about
[3:32:47] <%TheGreatSunbro> Potemkin literally POOPS damage
[3:32:48] <HoldBtoRun> lmao he does huge damage
[3:32:48] <Zombrocom> @Mahuloq I mean, have you seen how much damage pot buster does?
[3:32:52] <%TheGreatSunbro> Like he's just dripping in damage
[3:32:55] <$RealThiele> yea Pot dmg is bonkers still
[3:32:56] <BrojoJojoe> god imagine pot doing MORE damage
[3:32:57] <HoldBtoRun> esp in this game
[3:33:01] <PersonifiedTFT> Pat isn't doing huge damage because he doesn't know big combo but Pot buster still fucking murders people
[3:33:07] <PhiZeroOne> it's nice to see that pot isn't like
[3:33:09] <+SH1NK1R0> Lmao what. Pot can kill you in like 2 clean confirms
[3:33:10] <PhiZeroOne> bottom 1 any more?
[3:33:14] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[3:33:16] <%jaggstar2020> nice
[3:33:17] <PhiZeroOne> even if he's not as good as he was in the beta
[3:33:18] <MoshPitMoira> @TheGreatSunbro need a bucket and a mop, for this wet-ass-damage
[3:33:21] <gryffinp> @PirateMike_ what did you think it was
[3:33:21] <$HunterWalker23> iron tager colors, i see
[3:33:21] <$RealThiele> upset?
[3:33:22] <downmagic> double super the pat special
[3:33:23] <sir_nack> mahuloq has to be a potemkin player, theres no way anyone would say that otherwise
[3:33:24] <NitronStreams> YOOO
[3:33:26] <BrojoJojoe> that's yet to be seen @PhiZeroOne
[3:33:29] <RoidRidley> watch FABs pot, you will see things

[3:33:40] <PersonifiedTFT> STICK YOUR FOOT OUT
[3:33:49] <PhiZeroOne> god I will turn to ash if the numbers shake out and he's teh worst again

[3:34:13] <+pkmamsters> yyEAAAAAYYYsssssSSss
[3:34:14] <PersonifiedTFT> no way Pot is the worst in this game, the systems are built for him to exploit
[3:34:15] <iosephe> Beautiful reversal
[3:34:16] <Mahuloq> @sir_nack I havent played. I just have been watching a few streams. It just seems like his time to kills is pretty  long, I see all these other chars kill people in alot short times
[3:34:18] <$RealThiele> ah yeeees

[3:37:21] <Profmcstevie> So this is rollbacks power.... coneyFACT
[3:37:23] <PersonifiedTFT> @r_squared1672 No need to be scared, Obama is too much of a boomer to figure this game out, he spent all last night complaining about Sol spamming far slash lol
[3:37:33] <%TheGreatSunbro> Nago's normal super does such little damage I feel.
[3:37:44] <iosephe> close
[3:37:45] <+FoolsArcade> fucking close tho
[3:37:46] <$RealThiele> poked
[3:37:49] <AllenDeadman> good match
[3:37:50] <%barrakuta371> Close one
[3:37:52] <PirateMike_> From the trailers I thought it was a story game not a mortal kombat
[3:37:52] <Saltmeisterr> Should have gigantered
[3:37:53] <Profmcstevie> it does little damage cos it's got Invincibility frames
[3:37:54] <%Buttface_> Buttface_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months! nice to see pat returning to his glue eating roots
[3:37:54] <gryffinp> 5-3
[3:37:56] <scrublord009> You had bar for rc
[3:37:57] <%HitchhikingThrough> so close
[3:37:59] <%Monkeyweed21> poketemkin
[3:37:59] <downmagic> that super seems to be a pretty good anti air
[3:37:59] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Down jab always works
[3:38:00] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Those were good games
[3:38:03] <%heartlesshealer> heading out for now, have fun with the rest of your fighting game foibles, Pat. Good stream today videochessPaw
[3:38:06] <%TheGreatSunbro> @Profmcstevie Oh it do?
[3:38:18] <Rilogator> Pat megafisto in the lobby lmao
[3:38:19] <$RealThiele> Galaxy F, salute
[3:38:25] <SolomonMcMan> You landed HPB so you win in spirit
[3:38:34] <Uselesswhitenoise> unga bunga man leo time
[3:38:35] <Profmcstevie> @TheGreatSunbro generally if it doesn't do a lot, it's got I frames. a lot of characters have two supers for that reason
[3:38:38] <Mahuloq> Do people like this lobby better then the one they had for Granblue? I think the Granblue one was pretty cute
[3:38:42] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> DAMMIT PAT. I LOST MONEY
[3:38:45] <gryffinp> LEO TIME
[3:38:46] <+tactician0> game good
[3:38:51] <jorniev> ok so how is online?
[3:38:56] <Akett> Wow, this is the first time watching a stream that I've seen a Leo.
[3:38:57] <%HitchhikingThrough> @TurtlesAndTentacles why would you ever bet on pat
[3:38:57] <Profmcstevie> LEO THEME
[3:38:58] <+pkmamsters> yo this leo color
[3:38:59] <sir_nack> good start
[3:39:01] <+yukichocomilk> @Mahuloq i agree, loved that one
[3:39:04] <Zombrocom> HELLFIRE
[3:39:06] <+r_squared1672> Granblues lobby was great. Kinda wish we got something like that for this.
[3:39:07] <$RealThiele> paaaaatuh let me use channel points like salt
[3:39:09] <Akett> Color is sick.
[3:39:10] <%Monkeyweed21> @Mahuloq the new lobby ranges from reviled to merely tolerable
[3:39:11] <downmagic> wow this guy is going nuts
[3:39:12] <VirgilXII> that leo outfit is cool
[3:39:15] <%baka_sugoi> YE YE YE
[3:39:16] <%TheGreatSunbro> @Profmcstevie damn, ty for the heads up. Some Nago main I am LOL
[3:39:18] <gryffinp> grapplers exist within your opponent's fear, but even after the first thing that happens is geting pot bustered, leo will feel no fear
[3:39:26] <+pkmamsters> Tron: Leogacy
[3:39:31] <Zombrocom> @Mahuloq I think everyone agrees the strive lobby is pretty bad
[3:39:31] <%GalacticaPhanto> This Leo fears no grabs only gorilla
[3:39:49] <PersonifiedTFT> give it to em pat
[3:39:50] <scrublord009> Pat mash grab when you see his run through
[3:39:55] <Uselesswhitenoise> also anyone got a good idea roughly how good faust is?
[3:39:56] <Mahuloq> @yukichocomilk @Monkeyweed21 Ya the Grandblue one was a pretty cool with the 3d chibi chars and being able to walk around
[3:40:03] <downmagic> wow this connection is smooth
[3:40:07] <+mechslayer71> So is the game out out?
[3:40:11] <downmagic> 1 frame and 13ms
[3:40:21] <Zombrocom> @Uselesswhitenoise Real hard to say this early, but seems roughly mid-high
[3:40:24] <gryffinp> good burst
[3:40:30] <+yukichocomilk> not out for pc :(
[3:40:31] <Uselesswhitenoise> sweet
[3:40:32] <downmagic> it is if you are getting the expensive one
[3:40:34] <+mechslayer71> This is an early copy? It says out on 11
[3:40:34] <gryffinp> 6-3
[3:40:35] <%GalacticaPhanto> @mechslayer71 Only for Ultimate/Deluxe owners
[3:40:37] <sir_nack> out for deluxe edition buyers, not out fully til 11th
[3:40:40] <ElPlasa> This dude must live downstairs woth 13 ms
[3:40:40] <$RealThiele> the comeback is over
[3:40:46] <+r_squared1672> @Uselesswhitenoise Faust WAS pretty bad, but he's looking better. Hard to tell at this point since the game is still on day -3
[3:40:49] <%mighty_max_t> I feel like a lot of the new themes are bangers. Only ones I don't really care for are Axl's and Faust's
[3:40:53] <Profmcstevie> the leo command grab will catch you sleeping
[3:40:53] <+mechslayer71> @galacticaphanto ok makes sense
[3:41:11] <+gantz_zero> @mighty_max_t faust's is a journey
[3:41:24] <%GalacticaPhanto> This Leo fears the hands
[3:41:28] <PersonifiedTFT> pat is cooking this man
[3:41:29] <viewtifulr> uh oh is the fear setting in?
[3:41:58] <Uselesswhitenoise> I like finally having the real lyrics for the songs. Some of the guesses were way off
[3:42:04] <AllenDeadman> niiice
[3:42:09] <$RealThiele> Dream: over
[3:42:10] <downmagic> this guy was just pressin buttons
[3:42:11] <PersonifiedTFT> that was a big drop, he would have killed pat there
[3:42:12] <gryffinp> 7-3
[3:42:19] <luciluxlu0> I just check and nagoriyuki really has no nipples. also all these matches have been fire.
[3:42:20] <Zombrocom> Oh? Where can I find the official lyrics?
[3:42:22] <viewtifulr> This dream is dead
[3:42:25] <gryffinp> @Uselesswhitenoise Are there official lyrics somewhere? Where can I find them?
[3:42:26] <+Celarious> @Uselesswhitenoise Iron Clad Faith made us all a clown of fate
[3:42:35] <downmagic> built fear meter and collect salt
[3:42:38] <PersonifiedTFT> @luciluxlu0 Anji doesn't have nips either, no one does
[3:42:38] <RushUnplugged> it's a Leo, of course he's just pressing buttons
[3:42:45] <Uselesswhitenoise> check the wiki
[3:42:46] <reddpop_> is pat on the climb now?
[3:42:56] <Zombrocom> To be fair about clown of fate, armour clad faith is literally written on his outfit
[3:42:57] <Uselesswhitenoise> its got most of the lyrics up
[3:43:06] <%Ozavic> Why does the music go down to nothing in the middle of a match?
[3:43:07] <+BusterRepukken> King Gorilla
[3:43:11] <%Monkeyweed21> GET UNGAD
[3:43:12] <sir_nack> throw him out of the crossup dawg

[3:43:15] <mr_sups> Welcome to Leo and the Gorilla
[3:43:15] <ilpeggiore_> this leo doesn't know he can block
[3:43:17] <Zombrocom> But is the wiki the official lyrics or just guesses still?
[3:43:20] <downmagic> combos
[3:43:20] <RoidRidley> Ultra ultimate strong gorilla
[3:43:25] <Profmcstevie> fight the tide Pat, don't let him
[3:43:26] <+gantz_zero> apparently you can just grab him during his run-through move if you're fast enough @PatStaresAt
[3:43:28] <downmagic> oof
[3:43:29] <sir_nack> when hes running through i mean
[3:43:29] <gryffinp> I never believed clown of fate but I was expecting the song to be titled "Your society"
[3:43:33] <Uselesswhitenoise> offical
[3:43:33] <$RealThiele> wooo perfect
[3:43:36] <Feo_Leo> Leo go brrrr
[3:43:41] <Profmcstevie> Yea his run-through is not grab proof
[3:43:46] <scrublord009> When he runs grab him
[3:43:46] <luciluxlu0> @personifiedtft that sucks. why even play. aside from the game being good
[3:44:00] <%Monkeyweed21> now I remember why I mained Leo in Xrd
[3:44:09] <+TheIntellectional> it's kind of hard to do reactively at close range
[3:44:11] <AstrodropGaming> Leo's Gorilla Tactics are in full effect here
[3:44:11] <%Toynota10> How often you gonna play Strive you think?
