[0:11:09] <%chance_h> Peak 2008 content
[0:11:11] <$Ziegsy> Talis clima- no I wont
[0:11:12] <Sotetsu> Isn't that what you remember about ME2, as well?
[0:11:16] <red_blaster> Are you going to play Andromeda?
[0:11:16] <%coward_man> ME1 is old, and aged not great but not awful
[0:11:20] <peachy996> Actually it's the best Climax of all the games
[0:11:21] <%Garthunox> There's gonna be 2 climaxes
[0:11:21] <Ipsenscastle> Intro, Citadel, Virmire and Final Boss were the best bits of ME1, there's a lot of boring in between
[0:11:22] <Pookiedaexzile> THEY DID THE ASARI PUPPET TWICE !
[0:11:22] <+aartbastiaan> ME1 has waaaayyy too many item drops
[0:11:25] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Shepard's climax? That's against TOS.
[0:11:28] <@SSaryn> I saw a semi-hot take of someone wanting a Reaper party member for "ME4" and I'm like.. no.
[0:11:32] <MarylandJutsu> Also will you be going to play Vanguard in ME2 and 3?
[0:11:33] <SaltyAzteca> oh wow we're going in hard
[0:11:37] <sendart> ENEMIES EVERYWHERE
[0:11:38] <peachy996> As cool as the Suicide Mission is you're still fighting a Terminator near the end
[0:11:38] <dd44dostivei> most of me 3 is on the normandy
[0:11:39] <%LumberjackJack> YEAH, IT'S GREAT
[0:11:46] <MarylandJutsu> @SSaryn the f***
[0:11:50] <+aartbastiaan> @SSaryn reaper romance
[0:11:54] <Sotetsu> @ssaryn fmgWHAT What
[0:11:57] <%wibbwobbler> ME 2 bro
[0:11:59] <%DrTomT18> What if there was a crazy old man on the Normandy
[0:12:01] <%DrTomT18> who I love
[0:12:01] <$Ziegsy> the best dlc. More Dialogue
[0:12:02] <%X2Eliah> In ME2 it's kinda wild how terrible Zaeed is and how good Kasumi is
[0:12:05] <%sunsetdisc0> Robin sachs
[0:12:08] <MarylandJutsu> Kasumi is a bd ass
[0:12:11] <%DrTomT18> He died though :(
[0:12:15] <@SSaryn> Give me Sean Bean in Mass Effect.
[0:12:15] <peachy996> Robyn something
[0:12:18] <%twistedj3ster> Who cares about new characters when you have Wrex, Thane, and Jack
[0:12:19] <Ipsenscastle> Paul Hogan
[0:12:21] <%DarrenCastro> Absolutely cannot wait for Pat to meet Javik in ME3
[0:12:23] <+ryuguitarfreak> Kasumi IS GREAT
[0:12:24] <$dalmek> Civ 6 was Sean Bean wasn't it?
[0:12:24] <%scaryboisupreme> shame he died
[0:12:24] <%DrTomT18> No, he is dea d
[0:12:26] <peachy996> He passed away some time ago
[0:12:27] <stormhawk9891> Not Canderous
[0:12:30] <MarylandJutsu> Kasumi is probably my fav ME2 party member
[0:12:30] <%LumberjackJack> Zaeed's VA passed away :(
[0:12:30] <@SSaryn> Sean Bean does Civ 6's doesn't he?
[0:12:36] <+ryuguitarfreak> KASUMI DLC IS SO GOOD
[0:12:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Zaeed is great because he's all the mistakes Wrex isn't
[0:12:36] <%LumberjackJack> Sean Bean is Civ 6 narrator
[0:12:38] <+MightyDuckShoes> Mass Effect 4 should be about running a space bar
[0:12:40] <peachy996> Zaeed is cool though, Kasumi is okay.
[0:12:44] <Sotetsu> You're making me want to play ME series, but I'm worried I'll just buy it and never beat it
[0:12:45] <+aartbastiaan> Jack DansGame you mean Garrus
[0:12:45] <%DrTomT18> he died shortly after ME3 came out
[0:12:47] <Ipsenscastle> @SSaryn one of the quarian generals does have a Yorkshire accent like Sean Bean, he's great
[0:12:52] <Sunstalker> Zaeed dlc was more of a guest appearance for the VA then a proper dlc like Kasumi
[0:12:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Like he makes wRex better
[0:12:52] <dd44dostivei> he died right after citadel came out
[0:12:53] <%DrTomT18> Zaeed is the fucking man.
[0:12:58] <%justnathan18> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[0:12:58] <MarylandJutsu> @peachy996 you are allowed to have an opinon...even if its wrong
[0:13:03] <peachy996> Don't be talking shit on GUDDAMN Zaed
[0:13:03] <@SSaryn> @Ipsenscastle Oh fuck that's pretty alright where dat\
[0:13:04] <%DrTomT18> REAL SHIT?
[0:13:10] <+ryuguitarfreak> Zaeed is alright I guess
[0:13:10] <$Ziegsy> 'This DLC adds sir patrick stuart at the normandys janitor. Enjoy the 40 minute conversations!'

[0:13:35] <MarylandJutsu> @StaceMcGate Citadel DLC for ME3
[0:13:35] <%DrTomT18> Ilos is fucking awesome
[0:13:36] <peachy996> My opinion is wrong in all the right ways
[0:13:41] <%DrTomT18> its so spooky
[0:13:47] <%DrTomT18> and the talk with Soverign is AMAZING
[0:13:48] <peachy996> Kasumi is not my waifu though
[0:14:00] <+aartbastiaan> huh Virmire was great but Ilos was just cool because of the hologram
[0:14:06] <MarylandJutsu> @peachy996 i didn't say shes a waifu, I said shes fun and a badass
[0:14:08] <%DarrenCastro> Zaeed and Jack were two squadmates I hated back in 2010 but replaying ME2 and 3 Legendary I'm totally cool with em now
[0:14:09] <$NoctisxMog> does anyone know if they cut out the npc drawn out death screams in 2?

[0:14:34] <Pookiedaexzile> 360 or nothing
[0:14:37] <2DSuperiority> grrr the reapers did this
[0:14:40] <Ipsenscastle> I like how Vigil distracts you for several minutes during a highly time-sensitive all-or-nothing mission to tell you nothing new of value
[0:14:40] <%X2Eliah> Also in 2007/8, that Ilos run was LAGGY AS FK
[0:14:41] <%valriot> ME1 was a fuckin mess

[0:14:50] <peachy996> Almost Everyone is a badass though, that's not a big distinction in the ME2 Squad
[0:14:51] <%coward_man> I didn't have that cause console but I did have the Mako randomly flip out
[0:14:55] <MarylandJutsu> @SSaryn fair, at least clown farts doesn't immediately destroy your experience
[0:14:58] <Pookiedaexzile> 2 damn big
[0:15:00] <%Rumbutt> So much fucking texture pop in
[0:15:02] <@SSaryn> Fucking wow
[0:15:05] <peachy996> Like I said, she's okay
[0:15:09] <%scaryboisupreme> ME 1 - 3 are all super jank still
[0:15:09] <+aartbastiaan> I actually liked the Mako and don't think they could have done that better
[0:15:09] <%Pappajimbo> oh i know the actor from buffy he played Ethan Rayne the evil Giles
[0:15:10] <SaltyAzteca> That explains a lot
[0:15:11] <lemonpire> Me1 on the pc back in the day was soooooo jank
[0:15:12] <%DrTomT18> hue lad
[0:15:14] <sweatch0> woa?
[0:15:14] <%castlerock42> He's totally right.
[0:15:18] <GandhiTheTerrible> ye
[0:15:19] <+ryuguitarfreak> Wat? For real?
[0:15:20] <%Nuclearcherries> Holy shit
[0:15:20] <%coward_man> oh that explains that
[0:15:23] <$Ziegsy> oh wow. the words clown farts causes that music to play in my brain stem. Like its not even thought anymore
[0:15:27] <%DakotaMacDoodle> The BioWare way
[0:15:36] <%coward_man> you can feel it constantly tearing asunder
[0:15:39] <sweatch0> i never knew that
[0:15:46] <Pookiedaexzile> "We gotta cover system...what does it look like when you leave an enter cover....eh fuck it"
[0:15:48] <%TheotherKristian> Is Metroid Prime a streamable game?
[0:15:57] <peachy996> Oh wow y'know what I forgot about ME1 this week? Texture Pop ins
[0:16:05] <%DrTomT18> yeah, I had some bugs but nothing serious
[0:16:06] <+ryuguitarfreak> I remember I just could not install Bring down the sky. I never played it.
[0:16:08] <GandhiTheTerrible> It's been great so far!
[0:16:15] <MarylandJutsu> yeah people are just dumb
[0:16:19] <peachy996> Hey Pat remember Texture popins everywhere on the 360?
[0:16:20] <Ipsenscastle> it's much nicer to look at overall
[0:16:21] <omenesia> Don't dis EA Magic. DarkMode
[0:16:23] <%LumberjackJack> A massively effective port?
[0:16:27] <MarylandJutsu> Me1 was GARBO
[0:16:27] <%W1nterTitan> It was FUCKED
[0:16:28] <RushUnplugged> it also doesn't run on just 1 CPU core and it doesn't melt my pc
[0:16:30] <%coward_man> ME1 in this collection looks incredible compared to the original
[0:16:31] <hippofant> MASSive improvement TehePelo
[0:16:33] <+ThomasOfTroy> It was jank at the best of times
[0:16:35] <GandhiTheTerrible> It felt like eurojank
[0:16:45] <%Nuclearcherries> People just want to dunk on Mass Effect again
[0:16:47] <%SoundVoid> SoundVoid subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[0:16:48] <Ipsenscastle> I loved ME1 on release but even then I found it pretty fucking horrible to look at 90% of the time
[0:16:50] <%castlerock42> Mass Effect 1 bummed me out going back to it a couple of months ago. I had such fond memories of the gameplay, but I was so wrong. Good story and bad gameplay.
[0:16:51] <RushUnplugged> canuckjank
[0:16:52] <dd44dostivei> NO texture load in
[0:16:54] <+aartbastiaan> @GandhiTheTerrible eurojank is much better than that
[0:16:54] <MarylandJutsu> stinky canadian jank
[0:16:55] <aiutare47> Eyes on some characters look weird as shit, but it’s still an extraordinary improvement over launch 2007
[0:16:57] <SaltyAzteca> Canajank?
[0:16:57] <dan_g_v> hey chat peoples, why stream on weekend?
[0:17:00] <%snow_bush> Maple jank?
[0:17:00] <peachy996> CanadaJank is weird
[0:17:03] <%TIME_PUNCHER> french Canadian jank is 50% eurojank
[0:17:05] <%Dfreddy8> Canjank
[0:17:06] <GandhiTheTerrible> Canuckjank LUL
[0:17:06] <$Ziegsy> Ohhh Jank-ada
[0:17:06] <sweatch0> my favorite jank
[0:17:08] <peachy996> Janknada
[0:17:08] <%coward_man> man I want more Canada jank
[0:17:08] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Canada is just Euro-lite
[0:17:09] <%DrTomT18> would you say it was like Fallout New Vegas
[0:17:09] <%JamesCorck> Janknada
[0:17:10] <%Nuclearcherries> Legendary Edition is a great collection
[0:17:10] <%JoshManVGH> There's still JUST enough of it left to be nostalgic.
[0:17:10] <Pookiedaexzile> PS1 graphics for 10 seconds ever ytime you load in!
[0:17:11] <balthazar758> canjank
[0:17:11] <+MightyDuckShoes> Yeah the textures actually working is almost worth it alone
[0:17:14] <%walternatorz> it was fixed with hockey stick tape?
[0:17:18] <DSD24> Backporting is cool
[0:17:19] <%valriot> ME2 looks nicer now
[0:17:20] <%DakotaMacDoodle> CA-Jank eh!
[0:17:21] <%DarrenCastro> ME1 Legendary succeeds in making you think "it's always looked like that in my mind" when in reality they did a lot of work
[0:17:25] <%Vextalyst> Vextalyst subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! Hey pat as bad as ME3 ends atleast it's better than Dragon age where most people pretend Origins is the only game in the series. Seriously depressing how much the potential was wasted on that.
[0:17:26] <%LumberjackJack> It explains the horrible eyes. ME3 has some of that too
[0:17:29] <%JamesCorck> Now to see who dies in Virmire.
[0:17:32] <arkv01> thats pretty smart
[0:17:33] <%Garthunox> Speaking of jank Pat, i only fell through the world in Days Gone once, but it was after i beat the game and was doing clean up
[0:17:35] <%AzureGale> @dan_g_v Gotta finish ME1 before game rush next week
[0:17:36] <sajuk_khar> Well done PS1 graphics are awsome!
[0:17:37] <%valriot> The whole collection is just a "Hey, wanna play 3 good games with a shit ending cutscene?"
[0:17:38] <%coward_man> hey that sounds pretty simple with good results
[0:17:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> Have you heard the recent revelaitons about Canada still mistreating the natives?
[0:17:40] <MarylandJutsu> Saren got shafted
[0:17:40] <+ryuguitarfreak> Lighting/shadows is much better too
[0:17:40] <DSD24> Saren had a super cool look!
[0:17:44] <arkv01> thank the pipo
[0:17:46] <+aartbastiaan> Krogan balls.
[0:17:46] <peachy996> The horrible eyes make me think of Andromeda's eyes
[0:17:53] <RushUnplugged> Leviathan DLC is rad as hell
[0:17:54] <Ipsenscastle> ME3 is actually the hardest one to look at now, my Shepard looks fucking weird :(
[0:17:59] <sajuk_khar> Leviathan is the worst DLC
[0:18:01] <dan_g_v> @dan_g_v oh yeah, you're right, tons of stuff coming next week. Thanks!
[0:18:01] <+aartbastiaan> Mass Effect 5?
[0:18:03] <peachy996> The Leviathan has some good areas
[0:18:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Send them home
[0:18:04] <%valriot> True, Omega is a good ending
[0:18:05] <%scaryboisupreme> Hard disagree with the Leviathan DLC
[0:18:10] <%starlightvii> starlightvii subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! give me your money. why did I see that. was happenin. give me your money tho
[0:18:10] <MarylandJutsu> ME Next
[0:18:12] <%LumberjackJack> The flaw with Leviathan DLC was that you had to pay for what felt VITAL to the story. Like Javik's
[0:18:13] <%scaryboisupreme> Reapers didn't need an origin story
[0:18:13] <%justnathan18> I just bought bits and don't know how to donate them.... also couldn't leave a sub message. fml
[0:18:15] <%Nekros4442> @GeneralSCPatton What do you mean recent? We've treated natives terribly for decades
[0:18:16] <$Ziegsy> every time he says saren I keep thinking of seran wrap. the food wrap
[0:18:21] <peachy996> People's problem with the Leviathan DLC is the lore
[0:18:24] <Necnill> When everyone has forgotten the past~
[0:18:24] <%DrTomT18> Mass Effect 5 is gonna be set RIGHT after Me3 I think
[0:18:25] <+aartbastiaan> Mass Effect 4 will finally confirm the indoctrination theory Kappa
[0:18:25] <%valriot> Liara is visibly older in that teaser
[0:18:27] <GandhiTheTerrible> Isnt a new game being made?
[0:18:33] <%DrTomT18> you WILL play as Shepard in Me4
[0:18:33] <aiutare47> Leviathan is full of super cool concepts that I don’t think work as well as I’d like.
[0:18:36] <%DrTomT18> 5
[0:18:37] <dan_g_v> @dan_g_v @AzureGale Thanks! :3
[0:18:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Mass Effect 4: New Vollus
[0:18:39] <%DarrenCastro> Omega and Leviathan stories were great, I personally didn't like their gameplay. Citadel was great story+gameplay
[0:18:40] <+itsjusttom25> itsjusttom25 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! AYYYY one whole year of shoving my moners in pats face I hope u have Pissed it up the wall
[0:18:42] <%snow_bush> The problem is that everyone could be cyborgs
[0:18:44] <sajuk_khar> @scaryboisupreme  I sooo agree with your point on Leviathan
[0:18:46] <%NateyBeak> didnt casey hudson hide in a room with one other writer and do the ending in secret cuz he was angry and dumb
[0:18:51] <+Deebo305> Honestly Destroy ending is the easiest to make canon imo
[0:18:54] <%strakillias> strakillias subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! Hey Pat, remember that if you save the tower team you can save the salarians on Virmire.
[0:18:54] <+ryuguitarfreak> New game is going to be at least 600 years later because it's after Andromeda.
[0:18:54] <$Futurecity10> went from a 4/10 to a 5/10
[0:18:55] <%scaryboisupreme> I hope that Liara isn't the only returning squadmate in ME4
[0:18:56] <DSD24> Marauder Shields tried to sav \e us
[0:18:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> @Nekros4442 The revelaitons are recent. They keep uncovering more shit, some of which seems to still be happening.
[0:19:00] <GandhiTheTerrible> Still underwhelming
[0:19:00] <%Nekros4442> Casey Hudson is a hack
[0:19:01] <ScreamLord> Whatever Mass Effect 4/5 does. I want to play as something other than a goddamn human
[0:19:02] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Better =/= Good
[0:19:02] <peachy996> Yeah the Vanilla Ending was shiiiiiiiiite
[0:19:04] <RushUnplugged> it's still not GOOD but anything is better than "pick a color"
[0:19:07] <+aartbastiaan> Destroy ending will always be the best ending
[0:19:08] <%valriot> Most of the ending faults now lay on the single cutscene at the end, and its a bummer
[0:19:09] <%sunsetdisc0> gonna be honest I'm hoping we don't play as another soldier man. society has progressed past the need for soldier protags
[0:19:10] <%jillpilled> almost anything would be better than launch yeah lmao, fucking Casey
[0:19:12] <MarylandJutsu> the fact it HAD to happen
[0:19:13] <red_blaster> I played ME3 for the first time with all the DLCs and I liked it a lot
[0:19:15] <MarylandJutsu> is a problem
[0:19:20] <%moonmintparadise> Hey pat have you seen the new wasteland 3 dlc ?
[0:19:23] <%LumberjackJack> Ending experience went from 0/10 offensive to 3/10, maybe 4/10
[0:19:26] <%scaryboisupreme> Liara and the asari are just boring, I don't want space elves
[0:19:26] <+Deebo305> @aartbastiaan facts
[0:19:27] <%bread_assassin> It's no Game of Thrones ending anymore.
[0:19:29] <Ipsenscastle> The fact is they can't fix the fundamental problem of the ending being in direct opposition to the entire thematic thrust of the entire preceding story
[0:19:32] <jackelzxaa> Mass effect 5 playable races: human, bluman, gooman, and chewman
[0:19:32] <%LumberjackJack> YUP
[0:19:34] <peachy996> "Tell Me another story about the Shepherd"
[0:19:36] <dan_g_v> ah yes, the loyal crew abandoning Shepard to die way before they even needed to run
[0:19:38] <Pookiedaexzile> They put Peanuts on the shit
[0:19:40] <+liquidzr0> synthesis ending all day
[0:19:40] <%walternatorz> and that's why I boycotted all DLC for ME3
[0:19:42] <RedPlasticCup> should have NEVER explained the reapers
[0:19:44] <peachy996> Fucking hated those words
[0:19:46] <$Ziegsy> you mean like the ps3 castlevania did?
[0:19:47] <dd44dostivei> upgrade from catastrophe to poor
[0:19:47] <aiutare47> Yeah it’s fucky
[0:19:50] <Aydarkzero> but back then
[0:19:55] <@SSaryn> And were STILL TRASH
[0:20:00] <%Taisuru> Pat, what did you think of Dragon Age Inquisition? It's always seemed divisive.
[0:20:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Can't wait for this to get Defended
[0:20:03] <GandhiTheTerrible> oh yeah
[0:20:05] <%walternatorz> the DAY 1 DLC DID THAT
[0:20:05] <%valriot> Playing ME3 as it came out was bad, and its ALL on EA being fucking scummy over it. But playing it NOW, its fine
[0:20:08] <+StoopKid241> Javik locked behind day 1 DLC
[0:20:09] <sweatch0> big Agree
[0:20:10] <DSD24> Destroy Ending lets go
[0:20:11] <dan_g_v> That's why the Indoctrination theory is so much better than what we got
[0:20:12] <+RoeDeerRootie> I want my fucking sandwiches back
[0:20:16] <+aartbastiaan> @RedPlasticCup agreed, or give some information but leave out most of it
[0:20:17] <%Order_of_Mystery> Javik was day one dlc.
[0:20:18] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Mass Effect is the Dragon Age of Bioware
[0:20:19] <stormhawk9891> Oh yeah
[0:20:22] <DSD24> Inquisition had some good stuff
[0:20:23] <%coward_man> honestly ME3 with DLC is pretty good, it's not the disaster people make it out to be. But the original release was not good
[0:20:23] <%DrTomT18> bloated?
[0:20:23] <%TheotherKristian> 80hrs
[0:20:24] <%sunsetdisc0> the story is awful
[0:20:24] <@SSaryn> Idk Kingdoms of Amalar is pretty up there.
[0:20:24] <%bread_assassin> @PatStaresAt More than Valhalla?
[0:20:26] <GandhiTheTerrible> Yeah
[0:20:26] <+ThomasOfTroy> I can't play DAI and it makes me sad
[0:20:27] <+aartbastiaan> I liked Inquisition a lot
[0:20:27] <$Ziegsy> the canon ending for ps3 Castlevania was locked behind DLC
[0:20:29] <dan_g_v> I still remember when people were building the Indoctrination theory, it was interesting to watch
[0:20:30] <JoshTheFace> true
[0:20:30] <%LumberjackJack> Soooooooo much filler in Inquisition
[0:20:31] <%DakotaMacDoodle> maps are to big
[0:20:31] <$Futurecity10> Basically yeah
[0:20:32] <MarylandJutsu> thats valid
[0:20:32] <sweatch0> So many lil objectives it made me sick
[0:20:32] <%moonmintparadise> yeah
[0:20:33] <%X2Eliah> If you can handle the bloat, then inquisition story etc. is pretty rad
[0:20:33] <+YawnSong_> That D:C was real good though
[0:20:35] <MarylandJutsu> its very bloated
[0:20:35] <aiutare47> Explaining your big bad scary lovecraft god is almost always a bad idea. The whole point is that it’s unknowable and scary.
[0:20:37] <%templar010> Ayyy was waiting for this
[0:20:41] <peachy996> I don't really like Dragon age so I'll defer to you
[0:20:42] <Aydarkzero> that's odd
[0:20:43] <Ipsenscastle> I liked a lot of Inquisition, but I'd never play it again
[0:20:44] <jackelzxaa> I’m happy with the final state of me3 after a year of “we’re sorry” dlc’s, but i was so depressed at the original game on release
[0:20:46] <%walternatorz> god damn, I hated how monumental the Day 1 DLC was
[0:20:52] <+LionKagura> @DrTomT18 Dude do you knowhow much non sensical shit they make you do
[0:20:53] <peachy996> Space > Middle Age Fantasy
[0:20:54] <+ThomasOfTroy> It feels like a single-player MMO
[0:20:56] <MarylandJutsu> yeeeeepppppp
[0:20:58] <%Hitman0257> How do you feel about ME3 Squad
[0:20:59] <%Order_of_Mystery> dragon age wasn't good after 1
[0:21:00] <peachy996> Cuz it's SPACE!
[0:21:04] <%coward_man> remember that for Dead Space 3 you had to pay for the ending as DLC
[0:21:05] <+aartbastiaan> Dragon Age has some amazing lore but they're so slow to explore it
[0:21:08] <dd44dostivei> play as liara's daughter in 4 and she's voiced by jen hale, but shepard isn't mentioned
[0:21:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Imma start drinking every time someone says " ME3 was pretty good actually...."
[0:21:12] <%sunsetdisc0> inquisitions story is awful and I will physically fight anyone who says otherwise
[0:21:14] <%wibbwobbler> Closure is cool, hate me3 tho man
[0:21:16] <%X2Eliah> Having played Inquisition and Andromeda, inquisition is bloated, but not as much bloat as Andromeda. And Inquisiton has some good story & characters (unlike Andro)
[0:21:19] <MarylandJutsu> it really was a jojos bizzare adventure
[0:21:20] <@SSaryn> Oh yeah I should mention Mass Effect 3's Day 1 DLC is still tied to buying the Digital Deluxe edition of the game.
[0:21:21] <jackelzxaa> Is the hinterlands the only area like that?
[0:21:22] <foxname96> @patstaresat It is single player mmo after they scrapped mmo part
[0:21:23] <theladygrayson> I liked that I finally got to fight dragons in a game called Dragon Age
[0:21:27] <+Deebo305> Inquisition has open world syndrome
[0:21:27] <$Futurecity10> Dragon Age 2 was the first dragon age I played and I unironically love the game. But I know that its bad
[0:21:30] <$NoctisxMog> trespasser was the best thing in the game
[0:21:31] <dan_g_v> are there OTHER orbs in the Citadel, tho?
[0:21:34] <%DrTomT18> @DrTomT18 It's been a while but I don't remember anything lore breaking
[0:21:37] <%chance_h> Yep level systems in open world games are pretty hard to balance
[0:21:39] <%coward_man> @SSaryn of course it is!
[0:21:40] <DSD24> You fought a Dragon in Origins
[0:21:41] <+aartbastiaan> true
[0:21:42] <hippofant> I replayed Dragon Age Inquisition BibleThump
[0:21:45] <%TheotherKristian> RE-Reckoning
[0:21:49] <DSD24> At least two
[0:21:49] <%Taisuru> I fuckin love Amalur
[0:21:52] <%justnathan18> I wanted to send a sub message but it wouldn’t let me :(
[0:21:55] <%DrTomT18> yeah but Kingdom of Amalar is cool
[0:21:55] <%moonmintparadise> man, I really liked Dragon Age Origins
[0:21:57] <@SSaryn> Correct.
[0:21:57] <%twistedj3ster> it got a raw deal
[0:21:58] <MarylandJutsu> yeah
[0:21:58] <peachy996> Which has an armor in ME2
[0:21:59] <scrumbotime> yeeeeeeeep
[0:22:00] <%X2Eliah> amalur was such a flop
[0:22:04] <MarylandJutsu> thats the mood for amalur pat
[0:22:04] <GandhiTheTerrible> I loved it
[0:22:04] <DSD24> Chakarams are in Amalur!
[0:22:05] <%DrTomT18> is so fucking weird and I like it
[0:22:05] <+aartbastiaan> I love that game and yet I never finished it
[0:22:07] <%TheotherKristian> Took me thirty hours to get to credits,
[0:22:09] <Sotetsu> LUL
[0:22:09] <peachy996> The blu spiky Amalur Armor
[0:22:09] <%AncelDeLambert> @peachy996 origins
[0:22:12] <%JamesCorck> Did the VoD got cut off last night btw? The last 20 minutes or so seem to be missing.
[0:22:13] <MarylandJutsu> and the cards stuff
[0:22:13] <Ipsenscastle> @Futurecity10 DA2 is honestly the most interesting of them, it has huge problems but there's no reason to totally write it off
[0:22:15] <sweatch0> combat fun bland universe
[0:22:18] <Pookiedaexzile> He's waking up all the warriors
[0:22:19] <+aartbastiaan> empty
[0:22:20] <%moonmintparadise> Kingdoms is walking in big EEEEMPPPPTYY fields with good combat
[0:22:23] <RushUnplugged> now that's a game that's much better in memory because the remaster just shows how OOOLD it is
[0:22:23] <jackelzxaa> Remember when they put kingdoms of amalur reckoning dlc into mass effect 3?
[0:22:25] <%DrTomT18> is pat having a stroke
[0:22:27] <MarylandJutsu> it was cookie cutter
[0:22:33] <Aydarkzero> dang
[0:22:34] <+aartbastiaan> like offline WoW
[0:22:36] <sweatch0> fable mabe?
[0:22:36] <%TheotherKristian> Is it like WOW but offline
[0:22:38] <%MugenSandan> world of Warcraft but bad?
[0:22:38] <Nikmyth> Finally get to catch Pat live, heya chat! Franz  and Clemps sends a hi too o/
[0:22:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Faaaaaaantasssssy
[0:22:43] <Sunstalker> Like a Dragons Dogma but not?
[0:22:43] <%templar010> Its a single player MMO
[0:22:47] <peachy996> @AncelDeLambert There's a Dragon Age armor and an Amalur Armor in ME2
[0:22:47] <+aartbastiaan> @TheotherKristian jinx
[0:22:48] <%Retinolgaming> Poor Rhode Island. They finally make a cool thing and its a disaster.
[0:22:50] <GandhiTheTerrible> I really liked the class system
[0:22:51] <%X2Eliah> Yeah
[0:22:51] <%JoshManVGH> Insanely overwritten in the best ways?
[0:22:52] <jackelzxaa> Theres a stupid knight armor thats dumber than the dragon age armor
[0:22:55] <%SerpentScintilla> Its Graphics card art
[0:22:57] <gangsta_oki> Pat do you miss Seth killian sometimes?
[0:22:58] <%DakotaMacDoodle> I feel like them being forced to use the frostbite engine really tanked the devolvement of DA: I
[0:22:58] <%moonmintparadise> OH IT IS MEGA GENERIC
[0:22:59] <Ipsenscastle> I've tried to play Amalur twice because the stupid omniblade combat shit looked cool, but I always immediately bounce off when I see how it looks like a bad mmo
[0:22:59] <%X2Eliah> It was so ridiculously generic
[0:23:00] <%MugenSandan> Oh so Modern WoW
[0:23:00] <dan_g_v> oof
[0:23:01] <DSD24> The class system was neat
[0:23:04] <BlockingDisabled> Fable with less customization?
[0:23:10] <sweatch0> LUL
[0:23:12] <SilverFaustX> voodoo fx
[0:23:13] <%moonmintparadise> LUL LUL LUL
[0:23:20] <%coward_man> god that hits the nail on the head!
[0:23:26] <SilverFaustX> we old
[0:23:26] <+aartbastiaan> I thought that was always an Oblivion forest LUL
[0:23:26] <DSD24> Don't forgot about the Troll art
[0:23:27] <LeotheHuntsman> gamer wizard
[0:23:28] <Ipsenscastle> Steppenwolf
[0:23:29] <RushUnplugged> Amalur was also glued together with the remains of the failed MMO they were making
[0:23:32] <%SerpentScintilla> man I used to stare at that shit for ages when I was a kid
[0:23:32] <GandhiTheTerrible> jesus im old
[0:23:34] <@SSaryn> Hey man, if the analogy still works.
[0:23:35] <jackelzxaa> I played the amalur demo and when i got to the town i just did cutscene executions on the entire town and all the guards until my demo timer ran out because it was ridiculous to me that it let me do that
[0:23:39] <dan_g_v> time to feel old
[0:23:39] <%DrTomT18> Kingdom of Amalar is a DND game your DM writes when he's on shrooms
[0:23:39] <%wibbwobbler> LUL
[0:23:40] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> I member being so cool with my Voodoo
[0:23:43] <%JoshManVGH> It was written by RA Salvatore, the guy behind the million Forgotten Realms books
[0:23:43] <%MugenSandan> I miss the dumb names for graphics cards
[0:23:44] <peachy996> Hey Pat are you out of sync?
[0:23:48] <%X2Eliah> You cannot even mine a single bitcoin on voodoo fx
[0:23:50] <Sotetsu> But you knew exactly what he meany
[0:23:52] <peachy996> Nevermind
[0:23:53] <ScreamLord> Less Ancient and more Fossilized
[0:23:56] <+TwitchingEntrail> Voodoo 2 that stuff up
[0:23:57] <%LumberjackJack> And Andromeda's aliens are like design art for the Alienware crap
[0:23:59] <peachy996> Must hav been me
[0:23:59] <Aydarkzero> FeelsBirthdayMan Clap
[0:24:00] <jackelzxaa> Didnt amalur have the mass effect wheel
[0:24:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Amalur, Less lore than Dragons Dogma
[0:24:06] <%MugenSandan> Everything is model numbers now and not even cool mecha model names
[0:24:07] <%HRDSalami654> And I'm still pissed at Nvidia for buying them.
[0:24:11] <Sunstalker> I tried out amalur when it got on ps+ but in like the second zone I was starting to fall through the ground in the overworld and just turned it off
[0:24:13] <%echobee_tv> echobee_tv subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! burgers
[0:24:15] <sweatch0> HEHEHE
[0:24:21] <$xXRealGamerThaigeXx> thats such a good idea
[0:24:23] <MarylandJutsu> now gief will be more vacant
[0:24:24] <%Mr_Pylon> dogs fucking love dehydrated liver
[0:24:25] <sweatch0> he will be tricked hehehe
[0:24:27] <GandhiTheTerrible> Bacon bits
[0:24:27] <Sotetsu> How do they taste?
[0:24:27] <skyentombment> So they're like crack
[0:24:31] <jackelzxaa> Amalur more like Amalgam
[0:24:33] <+D00msDayDan> time for pat to assume direct control
[0:24:35] <%walternatorz> Pat, have you tried mind control treats on humans?
[0:24:37] <%AncelDeLambert> remember to check your pockets before throwing your pants in the wash, then
[0:24:41] <peachy996> I only touched Amalur to get that Armor for ME2
[0:24:42] <dan_g_v> Zangief: Father become magic! He bring treats out of pocket!
[0:24:42] <Ipsenscastle> that sounds like it'll drive him insane
[0:24:45] <GandhiTheTerrible> Fair
[0:24:47] <LunarRemix> Fair enough lol
[0:24:49] <%coward_man> Gief no care for taste, only food
[0:24:51] <sweatch0> is elmo hair low calorie?
[0:24:52] <MarylandJutsu> @walternatorz thats mcdonalds for paige
[0:24:56] <Pookiedaexzile> HE's gonna build  a tolerance
[0:24:57] <%moonmintparadise> you never tried zangiefs treats ?
[0:24:58] <%AncelDeLambert> I think he might just attack your pockets
[0:24:59] <chicken_apostle> Fuck Amazon and their commercials. I hope Bezos slips on a banana peel and perishes
[0:25:06] <%Vextalyst> Pat you should get some of those treats for Peach
[0:25:06] <%chance_h> Have you tried giving raw chicken 2 him? My Labs love those (uncooked 4 safety)
[0:25:08] <peachy996> I do not like Tech
[0:25:12] <%DrTomT18> Only 1, in Omega, for Engineer
[0:25:13] <%LumberjackJack> Engineer, yup
[0:25:15] <%valriot> The classes in 3 are ballers
[0:25:18] <%Garthunox> Yup
[0:25:19] <$xXRealGamerThaigeXx> yeah the omega dlc has engineer specific interupt
[0:25:19] <$Futurecity10> Enginner for the omega dlc
[0:25:22] <%DrTomT18> VANGUARD FOR LIFE
[0:25:23] <peachy996> Yeah it's in Omega but again I'm not a tech
[0:25:23] <%ThirdWelles> ThirdWelles subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Subiversary yay! I'm up to three whole stream babies! Pet the fattie pigdog for me please
[0:25:28] <%SerpentScintilla> tech in 1 was meh, but 2 so far its rather fun
[0:25:29] <%sunsetdisc0> there is, it's in the omega dlc for engineers
[0:25:36] <Pookiedaexzile> and 2
[0:25:36] <Sunstalker> It's wild that they didn't add more everywhere. Imagine using Biotic charge mid dialogue wheel kinamaLUL
[0:25:44] <DSD24> I love Infiltrator in ME 2
[0:25:45] <%bread_assassin> Sentinel all the way.
[0:25:47] <jackelzxaa> In omega dlc if you’re an engineer you get a special hacking interupt to solve a difficult problem quickly
[0:25:48] <%coward_man> I love playing a tech character in Mass  Effect
[0:25:48] <%snow_bush> Vanguard is great for pretending to be sonic due to going fast
[0:25:48] <%X2Eliah> Tech is... viable in 3; but still biotics / snipers outplay it
[0:25:49] <dd44dostivei> omega dlc is zzz
[0:25:50] <RushUnplugged> the melee attack changing based on your class was a neat detail
[0:25:55] <%DarrenCastro> ME3 is both fun as fuck but insanely broken by Vanguard NovaCharge even on Insanity
[0:26:05] <GandhiTheTerrible> Never felt like playing any other class except Vanguard and Infiltrator
[0:26:06] <peachy996> Infiltrator is my jam but pure tech no thanks
[0:26:08] <@SSaryn> POKEMON GUN
[0:26:11] <Sotetsu> ME is the series that made me love snipers.
[0:26:12] <Pookiedaexzile> But  Blue Jumpy go Warp
[0:26:21] <DSD24> The Tech Blade for Infiltrator was so cool! it was electricity blade
[0:26:22] <+aartbastiaan> by the way, ME2 on Insanity is so much harder than ME1 on Insanity
[0:26:23] <+D00msDayDan> you mean Pokemon Gun
[0:26:32] <SaphronBlackbourne> Tech is really fun in 2 and 3
[0:26:33] <peachy996> Sentinel I never understood
[0:26:34] <%Daxalog> Yup
[0:26:36] <%wibbwobbler> Infiltrator for some reason
[0:26:38] <%Order_of_Mystery> that Pal trailer looks rad
[0:26:44] <DSD24> @aartbastiaan Really depends on the class though
[0:26:46] <%AzureGale> Oh no
[0:26:52] <+aartbastiaan> Infiltrator in 1 is so OP
[0:27:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Blue Jumpy go sploosh, then I explode.
[0:27:05] <+liquidzr0> portilloSexyGreg
[0:27:06] <%justnathan18> Does anyone know how I can get a message to Pat? I subbed and lost my chance to say anything because I didn't see the option.
[0:27:09] <peachy996> Like it wasn't bad and I playd it no prob but it just nvr clicked why I should play it over Infiltrator, Soldier, Adept or Vanguard
[0:27:13] <%X2Eliah> Honeslty I think those who played ME3 multiplayer know that almost any class can be super fun and viable in ME3, some just moreso
[0:27:16] <Lamokmok> Tech kind of became the elemental magic of the game.
[0:27:17] <+aartbastiaan> @DSD24 I guess
[0:27:31] <%LeiaSkynoober> @justnathan18  You might be able to just reload!
[0:27:35] <%LumberjackJack> ME2 on insanity has spikes in difficulty due to some of the crazier enemies like the scion (Shockwave and tanky)
[0:27:35] <peachy996> Sentinel has nice tech armor I guess
[0:27:38] <%afronooch> @justnathan18 500 bits or 5$ dono. try refreshing and see if the prompt comes back
[0:27:39] <%DrTomT18> Vanguard is the funnest class
[0:27:41] <Lamokmok> Shotgun infiltrator was so much fun in multiplayer.
[0:27:42] <%DarrenCastro> ME2 Insanity can be fun if you go Sentinal, Soldier or Infiltrator, the rest can be a chore unless you pick good bonus powers
[0:27:46] <%Vyskus> Vyskus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! honestly I'm working today and I got nothing important because my brain is good mass effect is fun this stream is fun
[0:27:49] <@SSaryn> I mean
[0:27:51] <DSD24> Origins was so good
[0:27:56] <DatAsuna> Yeah the MP was good at encouraging you to play tons of classes and always change up your style
[0:27:58] <dan_g_v> why, is it an actual series?
[0:27:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HELLO ORBLORD
[0:28:03] <%valriot> DA2 is so bad LUL
[0:28:04] <%slimmixrp> Did originas age well
[0:28:06] <%JoshManVGH> it also had a REALLY solid ending
[0:28:06] <+aartbastiaan> I always pick infiltrator in 1 just so I can hack
[0:28:09] <%DrTomT18> I liked Dragon Age 2, even if it was just Dragon Age: MAss Effect
[0:28:09] <DatAsuna> awakening was okay
[0:28:09] <%MrMegaJackpots> dragon age 2 could've been so good
[0:28:13] <%JoshManVGH> Oof
[0:28:14] <@SSaryn> No mod for that huh?
[0:28:17] <+aartbastiaan> @slimmixrp no but play it anyway
[0:28:17] <DSD24> Origins aged well
[0:28:20] <+Deebo305> @x2eliah That's honestly the truth, I found every class is fun after playing the multiplayer
[0:28:20] <%moonmintparadise> having the ability to recruit the motherfucker from the first chapter that betrayed the wardens was a very clever feature
[0:28:23] <foxname96> Fuck off. Inquisition is bussin
[0:28:23] <%justnathan18> How do I kick in bits?
[0:28:25] <+ThomasOfTroy> There's a UI/text scaling mod
[0:28:25] <jackelzxaa> ME2 on hardcore is the sweet spot and also you need to play on hardcore to get the geth assault rifle, without bumping the difficulty down
[0:28:30] <%Garthunox> didnt you say that about Kotor 2 too?
[0:28:31] <peachy996> If they announce ME3 MP at E3 I will buy LE purely for that
[0:28:37] <DatAsuna> I still like parts of 2, like the idea of focusing on 1 city over 10 years.
[0:28:37] <jackelzxaa> Is there no text mods for origins?
[0:28:44] <peachy996> Yeah please do so
[0:28:44] <@SSaryn> Do it you won't
[0:28:50] <DSD24> Gotta save Kirahhe
[0:28:50] <%LumberjackJack> Gotta save Kirrahe!
[0:28:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Kirahee is cool save him
[0:28:52] <peachy996> Saving Kirrah pays off in ME3
[0:28:53] <%slimmixrp> @aartbastiaan I tried to replay and it was shit so I needed to know if it was me or the game
[0:28:54] <%scaryboisupreme> Gotta save the lizards
[0:28:57] <+aartbastiaan> you love it
[0:28:59] <Pookiedaexzile> f.f.f.f fuck em
[0:29:06] <%scaryboisupreme> Also the Tower is a much better place to have that battle
[0:29:09] <jackelzxaa> Kirahe is great he’s worth saving
[0:29:13] <dan_g_v> oh yeah, is there already a Butt Mod for Mass Effect so every cutscene focus on Garus and Wrex booty?
[0:29:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> EXACTLY
[0:29:18] <%Nuclearcherries> Let the salarians die. Cunts
[0:29:22] <DSD24> I just want cool characters
[0:29:23] <dd44dostivei> play as liara's daughter in 4 and she's voiced by jen hale, but shepard isn't mentioned
[0:29:23] <%scaryboisupreme> ME4 will 100% have you playing Shepard
[0:29:24] <%Lizard0TM> Lizard0TM subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! So Ashley is super dead come Virmire yeah?
[0:29:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WHOEVER SAID THAT I WANT TO KISS U
[0:29:27] <DatAsuna> if Thane is dead in ME2 but kirahe lived in ME1, he does Thane's ME3 thing but dies in the process.
[0:29:28] <%valriot> I can see ME4 letting you control any of the squad tbh
[0:29:28] <GandhiTheTerrible> i dont wanna
[0:29:29] <%cvp5127> gun go pew
[0:29:30] <+YawnSong_> inquisition is a great game.
[0:29:33] <%twistedj3ster> I wanna play as a space pirate tho
[0:29:34] <%Order_of_Mystery> i bet we'll play as Liara
[0:29:34] <+aartbastiaan> @slimmixrp the combat is not great, but you can get used to it. The rest is really good
[0:29:35] <Pookiedaexzile> nah
[0:29:37] <%MidnightBurst12> boooo
[0:29:37] <peachy996> No these Salarians are cool and help you in 3
[0:29:37] <%SirGO0SE> i wanna play as a blue stripper :(
[0:29:38] <Ipsenscastle> Asari commando please
[0:29:39] <%snow_bush> Soldier explains how you know how to use gun
[0:29:39] <%NopeBadguy> kinda wanna play a mercenary instead
[0:29:40] <Pookiedaexzile> Criminal
[0:29:42] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Btw Pat, why did you default to playing a soldier in ME1 back in the day?
[0:29:46] <%Lizard0TM> can't have a Mass Effect without pew pew
[0:29:46] <+LionKagura> @GandhiTheTerrible too bad
[0:29:46] <Pookiedaexzile> Who has to work for the alliance
[0:29:47] <%jillpilled> let me be an alien ffs already
[0:29:47] <%Agami23> no space cowboy for you.
[0:29:47] <%Lizard0TM> like wtf
[0:29:52] <DatAsuna> Soldier turned secret police
[0:29:53] <+LionKagura> I love soldier
[0:29:54] <+D00msDayDan> a game where you play not a human soldier would do great, but a game where you play a human soldier would do even better
[0:29:55] <balthazar758> as long as it is a cool story
[0:29:55] <%scaryboisupreme> I'm telling you, ME4 will be the Hunt for Shepard's Brain
[0:29:55] <jackelzxaa> Halo is a soldier man and he’s a cool man…
[0:29:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Criminal who has to work for the alliance
[0:29:58] <+aartbastiaan> @slimmixrp if you set up your tactics right you will never have to pay any attention to combat
[0:29:59] <+coldsama> Doesn't the salarian captain in Virmire only pays off in 3 if Thane is dead?
[0:30:02] <aiutare47> I think soldier worship is a human culture thing. People love hearing about heroic military epics.
[0:30:05] <%LumberjackJack> Wish ME4 would have an Origins-like start
[0:30:05] <%TheotherKristian> What's gonna be the protagonist's last name in the New Mass Effect!? From Sheppard, to Ryder to what!?!?!?
[0:30:06] <%Lizard0TM> YEAH
[0:30:07] <@SSaryn> Yeah ok
[0:30:07] <peachy996> If Andromeda let you play as the aliens, it would be more well recieved
[0:30:08] <%truexst0rm> If ME4 has Multiplayer, I'll be happy
[0:30:08] <GandhiTheTerrible> yep
[0:30:09] <+GamerWorlock> Geth
[0:30:10] <%Lizard0TM> LIKE THE ME3 MP
[0:30:10] <dan_g_v> Volus playthrough!
[0:30:11] <+captainplanet88> i wanna play as a krogan
[0:30:12] <DSD24> Do it like Origins
[0:30:13] <%NateyBeak> im so sick of humans me and my homies hate humans
[0:30:14] <Minorou> literally any other race
[0:30:14] <+StoopKid241> That would be so interesting
[0:30:15] <JoshTheFace> SAME
[0:30:16] <Ipsenscastle> playing as aliens in ME3 multiplayer was SO FUN
[0:30:16] <%X2Eliah> Maaan Pat you super missed out on the ME3 MP then xD
[0:30:16] <%jillpilled> exactly if literally JUST that
[0:30:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Play as a former soldier turned diplomat @patstaresat
[0:30:19] <%afronooch> YEP
[0:30:20] <DatAsuna> Just like ME3 MP
[0:30:20] <+aartbastiaan> Asari BOOBA
[0:30:21] <Pookiedaexzile> KROGAN
[0:30:22] <dan_g_v> Play as a Jellyfish!
[0:30:23] <@SSaryn> Let me play as a Volus fuck it.
[0:30:23] <%slimmixrp> @aartbastiaan maybe I will try again
[0:30:24] <%valriot> Either full species select, or let you play as your Squad members
[0:30:25] <%jillpilled> Ditto!
[0:30:26] <Lamokmok> I wanna play a Krogan.
[0:30:26] <%Nekros4442> ME3 multiplayer at least
[0:30:26] <arkv01> play as a krogan and sex up all the earth ladies
[0:30:28] <DSD24> I wanna be a Salarian!
[0:30:29] <%demiiluna> Volus protag when
[0:30:29] <+evbites> turain would be awesome
[0:30:30] <+Inferno_Icon> Hannar
[0:30:30] <%coward_man> let ME4 have a character creator and choose your species
[0:30:32] <DatAsuna> ME3 MP had krogans with hammers
[0:30:33] <+captainplanet88> big meaty lizard man
[0:30:33] <Minorou> even batarian
[0:30:34] <%scaryboisupreme> Just don't make me Liara, can't stand space elves
[0:30:34] <jackelzxaa> I dont think we get turian or salarian because of how much work theyd need to do for character creation
[0:30:34] <dan_g_v> Jellyfish or nothing!
[0:30:35] <%LumberjackJack> Fuck it, I'll take Batarian
[0:30:35] <peachy996> If you could play as the other 3 Pathfinders in MEA, it would have been better
[0:30:36] <+Kingtut9009> @PatStaresAt I just want some kind of co-op mass effect game where you can play as an alien
[0:30:36] <GandhiTheTerrible> Krogan Battlemaster in ME3 felt SO GOOD
[0:30:36] <%MugenSandan> ME4: Your robot team mate should just be a Titanfall Titan
[0:30:39] <%NateyBeak> biotic god volus main OC
[0:30:39] <%Lizard0TM> THEY DID THAT WORK FOR ME3
[0:30:40] <foxname96> JUST LIKE VOLUS IN ME3 MP
[0:30:41] <%walternatorz> could have done that with andromeda
[0:30:42] <%Agami23> ok, but you play as a space elf thats just a human with pointy ears
[0:30:44] <%Lizard0TM> in MP
[0:30:45] <%Nuclearcherries> I wanna play a volar
[0:30:45] <ScreamLord> Human are boring. I would know
[0:30:45] <%bread_assassin> I wanna be a Drell.
[0:30:47] <Pookiedaexzile> KROGAN RENEGADE IS JUSTIFIED
[0:30:47] <dan_g_v> bring the tentacles, you cowards!
[0:30:49] <%LumberjackJack> BIOTIC GOD VOLUS
[0:30:51] <%jillpilled> Mean a lot of it was in 3 MP
[0:30:52] <%X2Eliah> Salarian Infiltrator for LIFE
[0:30:52] <%truexst0rm> I'd wanna play as an Elcor
[0:30:53] <%chance_h> Play as volus orb
[0:30:53] <%valriot> Its not even a lot of work tbh, the Multiplayer in 3 made EVEN VOLUS PLAYABLE
[0:30:54] <aiutare47> ME3MP let you play as a Turian with a jet pack @patstaresat
[0:30:54] <spectre_shrimp> i would like to see non humanoid aliens playable in combat
[0:30:55] <@SSaryn> Do what most games did like Vampire the Masquerade did, short game big replayability
[0:30:56] <DatAsuna> The other pathfinders were the most disappointing thing in MEA
[0:30:57] <%Lizard0TM> Oh that makes sense
[0:30:57] <+GamerWorlock> Hanar lol
[0:30:59] <+aartbastiaan> play Volus and open a bank
[0:31:02] <%wibbwobbler> Same with dragon age lmao
[0:31:03] <%NateyBeak> naw same voice, but added filter over it for turian
[0:31:03] <Minorou> just slap a voice filter, it'll be fiiiine
[0:31:05] <peachy996> Just the Human and Turians though
[0:31:05] <+coldsama> Me3 multi-player not being in Legendary is a missed opportunity for both a cool experience and a rework of the economic aspect of this game mode
[0:31:06] <+evbites> just put a filter on
[0:31:09] <DatAsuna> I like that the asari in ME3 MP can phase shift through walls
[0:31:09] <%TheotherKristian> Let me play as a Geth roboto
[0:31:09] <%jillpilled> just reuse lines, fuck it lol
[0:31:10] <dan_g_v> I was space hypos renegade playthrough
[0:31:11] <%DakotaMacDoodle> A lot of work that would guarantee sales
[0:31:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Playbas Shepards kid and the race determines who his/her parted was
[0:31:15] <jackelzxaa> Mass Effect 5: you just get human and asari and thats it
[0:31:16] <%Lizard0TM> play as an Elcor
[0:31:16] <dan_g_v> I want even
[0:31:18] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt There's a mod for Andromeda that lets you play as a Turian
[0:31:18] <%coward_man> you could just put a voice modulator for each species?
[0:31:19] <+captainplanet88> oh shit i forgot about the jellyfish
[0:31:24] <Ipsenscastle> YES
[0:31:24] <peachy996> Exactly
[0:31:26] <%AzureGale> What about both
[0:31:27] <Pookiedaexzile> NO
[0:31:30] <+ThomasOfTroy> I'd exchange classes for races, that'd be nice
[0:31:32] <foxname96> @patstaresat You could play Volus Biotic commando in ME3 multiplayer
[0:31:32] <%afronooch> The races were basically classes in mp
[0:31:34] <Pookiedaexzile> No
[0:31:34] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt You should be picking a race and associated Origin
[0:31:35] <@SSaryn> Sure, that'd be fine
[0:31:35] <RushUnplugged> let us play as BLASTO
[0:31:36] <dan_g_v> we need more quadrupe characters
[0:31:37] <Sunstalker> You'd be surprised how strong every damn class is, Pat. Like the goddamn Vorcha are powerhouses, the volus too, they're all amazing. basic soldiers are kind of poopy for higher difficulties
[0:31:40] <notsoy> a race, and point-buy ability system
[0:31:40] <dirtyh4rr1> why not both
[0:31:40] <+liquidzr0> turian all day
[0:31:44] <%Daxalog> Vampire the Masquerade was the coolest about that.
[0:31:46] <+coldsama> Playing as the Biotic Volus God
[0:31:46] <BenLanBen> Nope. Humanses ftw
[0:31:47] <arkv01> I strongly suspect race selection will be a thing in the next ME
[0:31:48] <peachy996> Salarians are Tch
[0:31:48] <Pookiedaexzile> No  you wanna mix shit up
[0:31:49] <dan_g_v> forget the asari, they are boring
[0:31:51] <stantheman_97> i want to be an elcor
[0:31:51] <%demiiluna> What if they made it so the protagonist is just an Asari, but no other options?
[0:31:52] <aiutare47> Infiltrator- Salarian Adept-Asari
[0:31:52] <%NopeBadguy> the only thing is that me races are so diverse that parts of the game could be drastically different depending on race
[0:31:56] <GandhiTheTerrible> Krogan Vanguard/Battlemaster
[0:31:57] <%scaryboisupreme> But they showed Liara finding Shepard's helmet in that Game Award trailer
[0:31:58] <DatAsuna> Asari valkyrie sentinels tho
[0:31:58] <+captainplanet88> both
[0:32:01] <jackelzxaa> Just do the multiplayer characters from 3, so you have 30 choices
[0:32:02] <N7TheLegend> Batarians are space orcs.
[0:32:04] <aiutare47> Salarians are who?
[0:32:05] <peachy996> Salarians are Tech/Infiltatrors
[0:32:05] <+aartbastiaan> quarians?
[0:32:06] <Ipsenscastle> done
[0:32:07] <%barrakuta371> Geth?
[0:32:07] <@SSaryn> Let me be Drell tho
[0:32:08] <Lamokmok> Naw Krogan Vanguard
[0:32:09] <%valriot> That can work, or at least give a cross over with a few
[0:32:10] <DatAsuna> Salarians would be infiltrators
[0:32:13] <HollowMan190> why would humans be vanguard
[0:32:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Fuck that
[0:32:14] <%truexst0rm> I'd rather choose both Race AND Class, like any other game would let me do
[0:32:15] <dan_g_v> Elcor's as boss characters?
[0:32:15] <jackelzxaa> Drell would be adepts too
[0:32:15] <%Hitman0257> That is kinda what the mutilplayer ws
[0:32:16] <firewhiskeys> i think krogans would be vanguards tbh
[0:32:16] <+D00msDayDan> ea hire this man
[0:32:17] <arkv01> ok but can I play as a thresher maw
[0:32:17] <awalbaru> Actually good concept
[0:32:21] <MarylandJutsu> Drells were fun
[0:32:21] <+evbites> turain solidier
[0:32:23] <$Solid_Stro> sabert14Box
[0:32:24] <+aartbastiaan> quarians would be 100% tech
[0:32:24] <%sunsetdisc0> no the geth would be infiltrators
[0:32:27] <+Dova573> If I remember correctly you could played other races on ME3 mp?
[0:32:27] <peachy996> Salarians can't be Sentinels, no Biotics
[0:32:29] <jackelzxaa> Krogan are strong biotics
[0:32:34] <Pookiedaexzile> EA ignore this man
[0:32:40] <+aartbastiaan> rip ashley
[0:32:41] <jackelzxaa> Can salarians not use biotics?
[0:32:42] <peachy996> Turians would be Sentinels
[0:32:42] <awalbaru> imagine a Mass Effect battlefront
[0:32:45] <DSD24> @Dova573 You totally could
[0:32:45] <%ScottishMadJacko> YEAH
[0:32:45] <@SSaryn> He's not Ashley.
[0:32:46] <Sunstalker> A Krogan with a cloak would still not be an infiltrator 🤔
[0:32:47] <bigshedman> @Dova573 Yeah you could and it kicked massive ass.
[0:32:47] <%AzureGale> What about Vorcha , the biotic gods
[0:32:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FINISH HER
[0:32:48] <dan_g_v> so, no more shitting on Ash ley?
[0:32:50] <$xXRealGamerThaigeXx> kaiden grows on you
[0:32:50] <%slimmixrp> We should keep ashley around to bully
[0:32:50] <DatAsuna> @Dova573 yeah tons of them, even volus
[0:32:50] <%X2Eliah> kaidan is pretty OK
[0:32:51] <GandhiTheTerrible> Kaiden's fine
[0:32:52] <lyzejag> He's better than that racism lady
[0:32:52] <%Torus1025> He's your Boy
[0:32:53] <DSD24> Its cause he's New Carth Pat
[0:32:53] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt you just want a side story called Mass Effect: Garrus where you play as Garrus on Omega while Shep is dead for two years
[0:32:55] <%Nekros4442> But we can Ice Ashley so fucking hard later
[0:32:55] <jackelzxaa> In the multiplayer i think salarian are just tech classes
[0:32:56] <%X2Eliah> Kaidan is Canadian OK
[0:32:56] <%templar010> Kaiden is too cool for that
[0:32:56] <%jillpilled> Kaidan's milque toast but he's a little cool
[0:32:57] <+evbites> kaidan is better then carth
[0:32:58] <%NopeBadguy> Kaidan is boring but he's never as snooty as Carth was
[0:32:58] <%valriot> Kaiden stays as a "Youre alright"
[0:33:01] <%coward_man> Kaiden is better than Carth
[0:33:03] <%TheotherKristian> He is an inoffensive Canadian, what more could we want
[0:33:04] <%ScottishMadJacko> Ashley doesnt even deserve the effort involved in shooting her
[0:33:07] <%AncelDeLambert> this will be the first time I see Kaiden in 2 and 3, then
[0:33:07] <theladygrayson> Kaidan is a good dude. Never liked Ashley
[0:33:07] <+coldsama> All my money on the next mass effect being so far ahead Quarians no longer wear suits
[0:33:07] <%afronooch> Hi No Signal!!!
[0:33:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BIDEO BAME
[0:33:11] <%Nuclearcherries> Pat Vs Racism
[0:33:11] <%AzureGale> Mass Effect: No Signal
[0:33:13] <dan_g_v> who is Cart?
[0:33:13] <%truexst0rm> Ashley is Racist, so kill her
[0:33:16] <%DarrenCastro> Romance Kaiden ME3 to let Garrus and Tali get it on
[0:33:17] <arkv01> no signal is now big signal Kreygasm
[0:33:17] <peachy996> Ah well, I GUESS we'll let Ashley die as a Hero
[0:33:20] <aiutare47> @patstaresat but you get to see Ashley’s skull get fucking wrecked in ME3
[0:33:23] <+evbites> @NopeBadguy he kicked an abuser to death
[0:33:24] <jackelzxaa> Videogame now
[0:33:26] <stantheman_97> lov u no signal
[0:33:27] <iosephe> yep
[0:33:28] <$Solid_Stro> Kaiden is white-bread but at least he’s not a racist
[0:33:29] <demiiluna> Asari Adept, Turian Soldier, Quarien Engineer, Salarian Infiltrator, Krogan Vanguard, Volus Sentinel?
[0:33:30] <BenLanBen> Ashleleley leley leley leleleleley leleley leley leley ley
[0:33:30] <%Order_of_Mystery> Kaiden becomes better Carth unironically
[0:33:31] <+aartbastiaan> Ashley talks about poets too much
[0:33:32] <$dalmek> it would, yeah
[0:33:40] <%X2Eliah> True.
[0:33:40] <vile_brand> every time
[0:33:42] <+evbites> @aiutare47 just youtube it
[0:33:45] <theladygrayson> Also, Kaidan enjoys bacon and whiskey, what's not to like?
[0:33:46] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat doesn't understand the need to play as a Vollus Vangaurd or Asari Solider
[0:33:46] <+D00msDayDan> No Signal would be a DLC
[0:33:48] <+Warlofe320> Warlofe320 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:33:49] <%NopeBadguy> @evbites i take it back, he's even better than carth ever was
[0:33:50] <DSD24> YES
[0:33:51] <lyzejag> YEAH
[0:33:51] <%echobee_tv> That's a great idea.
[0:33:52] <%afronooch> perfect
[0:33:52] <peachy996> And no Salarians currently don't have Biotics but Turians do
[0:33:53] <%takotoots> that would be rad
[0:33:54] <DSD24> That'd be rad
[0:33:54] <%Order_of_Mystery> YES
[0:33:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Because he's small
[0:33:54] <Ipsenscastle> good
[0:33:54] <%MrBorisMakarov> that's fine
[0:33:54] <DatAsuna> that would be so good
[0:33:55] <%X2Eliah> YEA YEA YEA
[0:33:56] <%Warlofe320> hey
[0:33:56] <%NateyBeak> best game
[0:33:57] <%SABiscotti> YEAH
[0:33:58] <Sunstalker> THAT WOULD BE THE BEST
[0:33:58] <%AncelDeLambert> well, the normies would scream and piss about it
[0:33:59] <sweatch0> yes yes to that
[0:33:59] <%Warlofe320> Gamer
[0:33:59] <Necnill> That'd be nice.
[0:33:59] <stantheman_97> amazing
[0:34:00] <%AzureGale> Ah, the Dragon Quest X approach
[0:34:00] <peachy996> That's why Turians = Sentinels
[0:34:01] <signofzeta> It'd be neat as hell
[0:34:01] <arkv01> fuck humans
[0:34:02] <%SABiscotti> No Humans Allowed
[0:34:03] <JoshTheFace> YEA
[0:34:03] <%MidnightBurst12> people would be mad but fuck em
[0:34:04] <dd44dostivei> play as liara's daughter in 4 and she's voiced by jen hale
[0:34:05] <+aartbastiaan> humans are all dead
[0:34:06] <%Daxalog> Imagine the rage
[0:34:07] <jackelzxaa> Theres some FUCKED UP renegade kills in me3 of former squadmates
[0:34:08] <DSD24> I was a Qunari in Inquisition and it was so cool
[0:34:08] <%Agami23> only on NG+
[0:34:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Best game
[0:34:09] <%Mr_Pylon> pretty poggers
[0:34:09] <%Ynkubus_> or human are dlc paywalled
[0:34:10] <bigshedman> What if that one ending from ME3 was canon and humans are the enemy?
[0:34:12] <aiutare47> Someone would get mad
[0:34:13] <Blank9> if it took place pre-humans but after other aliens found each other
[0:34:13] <DeepPix3l> No-Signal Chan is the strongest spectre of all
[0:34:13] <%twistedj3ster> Ashley would be furious
[0:34:13] <DatAsuna> SWTOR shoulda done that for certain classes tbh
[0:34:13] <Seshori> maybe liara had a kid and you play as them?
[0:34:14] <kifflomdolphin> I wouldn't mind that, I'd love to be a Krogan for once.... or a Hanar.
[0:34:14] <%LilyaFatal> Very cool idea, never gonna happen
[0:34:15] <%LumberjackJack> Instantly starts the game at an 8/10 if it did
[0:34:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Humans died off years ago
[0:34:16] <Minorou> playing human when there are other options is for cowards
[0:34:17] <%Warlofe320> How we doing
[0:34:19] <commander_ninja> I think Ashley is an interesting character. Wouldn't personally like her but she's definitely an interesting addition. More unique than bland-nothing Kaiden
[0:34:19] <%coward_man> nah the borings would get mad and Paul Marketing wouldn't know how to market it
[0:34:19] <+aartbastiaan> Play as an anti-human Batarian terrorist
[0:34:20] <jackelzxaa> What if in mass effect more you had to be a batarian
[0:34:25] <awalbaru> All humans got to Andromeda
[0:34:25] <%cvp5127> @PatStaresAt ok playable alien but your entire team is humans
[0:34:25] <%LilyaFatal> "I WANNA PLAY ME THO. MEEE!"
[0:34:27] <%X2Eliah> Reddit gamergaters would riot tho
[0:34:29] <%demiiluna> Would it be okay if they just have one voice for males and one for females, and just filter it to do the different races?
[0:34:31] <$Solid_Stro> And you can’t fuck humans either sabert14Sip
[0:34:36] <%SABiscotti> @jackelzxaa EW
[0:34:36] <jackelzxaa> Vorcha as the default starting character
[0:34:38] <%truexst0rm> Well, what if Ashley came back from the dead, and didn't let other races play ME4?
[0:34:42] <%chance_h> U only play as Batarian and must raid settlements
[0:34:42] <+yoshkosh20> I’d wanna play as a quarian or an elcor
[0:34:44] <%Nuclearcherries> No people just weird ass aliens
[0:34:44] <%takotoots> psaDogchamp
[0:34:48] <%Order_of_Mystery> mass effect 4 race selection with dragon age 1 prologs
[0:34:50] <kifflomdolphin> Ah, Vigil, what a great song.
[0:34:51] <@SSaryn> psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail
[0:34:51] <+coldsama> You can only play as a Vortcha or a Batarian
[0:34:51] <%DEETRz> let me be a volus
[0:34:52] <signofzeta> I'd be playing a krogan for the rest of my days
[0:34:52] <%AzureGale> Dogs ARE good
[0:34:53] <%MidnightBurst12> facts
[0:34:55] <%coward_man> dogs are awesome

[0:40:04] <+evbites> just jacked frogs
[0:40:04] <%JamesCorck> Maybe Plague can draw it for us.
[0:40:05] <%ThirdWelles> All Quad

[0:40:08] <+imspacingout> naked turtle
[0:40:09] <ScreamLord> They do have a hump back
[0:40:09] <%Mekhet09> Mekhet09 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! Bozjan is awful. Is relic hunting always this bad?
[0:40:11] <Ipsenscastle> just a big pile of tits
[0:40:11] <brisk_dacat> The gotta be shredded like 12pack
[0:40:13] <SummonerMagno> psaDogchamp
[0:40:13] <%ThirdWelles> Nothing but quad scrote
[0:40:15] <signofzeta> kinda wierd how grunt came out with th armor
[0:40:15] <%truexst0rm> And they have 4 Balls
[0:40:17] <%X2Eliah> Has Plague drawn some furry porn of Krogans?
[0:40:17] <%Arancet> its weird that turians apparently have the huge collar bones that match their armor
[0:40:17] <jackelzxaa> Krogans have shells
[0:40:17] <solidus1992> 3 dicks
[0:40:18] <%UvBenServed> Same as a Fall Guy
[0:40:20] <Seshori> there are those status of them in tachunka and they look... more ripped?
[0:40:20] <jackelzxaa> Kinda
[0:40:22] <peachy996> Porn artists make em look basic
[0:40:23] <Necnill> They're the opposite of the frogs they made gay
[0:40:23] <jackelzxaa> Its in the artbokk
[0:40:25] <%ThirdWelles> ALL scrote
[0:40:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> are their weird hips part of the armor or their actual legs
[0:40:27] <Ipsenscastle> the traverse yes
[0:40:28] <@SSaryn> Hey man, it's a good track to do so in.
[0:40:28] <stantheman_97> more like a big ugly bearded dragon
[0:40:32] <zanzibarian_hamster> Their armour is like a turtle shell, they're born with it
[0:40:34] <jackelzxaa> Naked turians salarians and krogan are in the artbook
[0:40:34] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt you can try to hook up with samara in 2, and it'll come back up in 3, but justicar code prevents anything from really happening
[0:40:37] <%X2Eliah> Pat, 3 is all over
[0:40:38] <jackelzxaa> Theyre more like turtles
[0:40:39] <%sunsetdisc0> krogan are really top heavy. if you toppled one, you could probably get some good headshots in before they got back up
[0:40:40] <+Deebo305> Their humor stores water to keep their bodies cool HypePotion
[0:40:40] <+alphonseisbest> no
[0:40:41] <Aydarkzero> D:
[0:40:43] <%scaryboisupreme> you do that in 2 and 3
[0:40:44] <%Arancet> thats craaaazy

[0:40:46] <Jontman42> what's there tho
[0:40:47] <+alphonseisbest> pat we go over there in 2
[0:40:47] <%DrTomT18> You do there a lot in 2 and 3 dude
[0:40:47] <%JohnAtDawn> No that's the Halo part
[0:40:47] <jackelzxaa> 2 is the top part
[0:40:48] <$Futurecity10> You mean 2?
[0:40:49] <%afronooch> no
[0:40:50] <Alzero83> no
[0:40:51] <peachy996> Doubt it
[0:40:51] <@PlagueOfGripes> what if in mass effect 4 you hang out in the core and die
[0:40:51] <%coward_man> isn't that where ME2 takes place?
[0:40:52] <Ipsenscastle> 3 is the whole milky way
[0:40:52] <%Lizard0TM> 3 is literally the entire thing
[0:40:53] <brisk_dacat> 10/10 game of the year
[0:40:54] <%JamesCorck> No really.
[0:40:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ME3 goes everywhere Pat
[0:40:54] <AmuserName> @PatStaresAt Most of ME2 takes place in the Upper-Right
[0:40:55] <+liquidzr0> you hangout in the top in 2
[0:40:55] <Necnill> @sunsetdisc0 Sounds like cow tipping
[0:40:55] <jackelzxaa> 2 is the terminus systems
[0:40:56] <stantheman_97> you do that in 2
[0:40:56] <+red_cuppa> youve gone too far
[0:40:57] <+alphonseisbest> thats 2 pat
[0:40:58] <+megaman_sentinel> no
[0:40:58] <+Shaggnar> LUL
[0:40:58] <+aartbastiaan> They said only like 1% of the galaxy's worlds were even explored
[0:40:59] <%valriot> Thats where Rannoch is
[0:40:59] <Jontman42> no don't do that
[0:40:59] <%LumberjackJack> LUL
[0:40:59] <+RyTYoung> But 4 will never exist
[0:40:59] <GandhiTheTerrible> LUL
[0:41:00] <%Daxalog> Is that Andromeda?
[0:41:00] <Pookiedaexzile> That's 2
[0:41:00] <Aydarkzero> they did that Kappa
[0:41:00] <balthazar758> galaxies are pretty huge
[0:41:01] <+JaseAdrift> already happened
[0:41:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:41:02] <%scaryboisupreme> ALPHA CENTURI HERE WE GO

[0:41:03] <Alzero83> Andromeda yovgStare
[0:41:03] <%coward_man> like you went to Omega
[0:41:04] <%DrTomT18> Pat you dumbass
[0:41:04] <%ThirdWelles> NOPE NEW GALAXY IT'S GOTTA BE BIGGER
[0:41:05] <+LionKagura> ANDROMEDA
[0:41:06] <Ipsenscastle> played yourself
[0:41:07] <%NopeBadguy> play during the prothean cycle
[0:41:10] <jackelzxaa> You forgot but most of 2 is the top of the map
[0:41:11] <+ThomasOfTroy> What if you went UNDERNEATH this galaxy?
[0:41:15] <$Futurecity10> Andromeda had so much fucking potential
[0:41:16] <Aydarkzero> guess ya gotta play andromeda
[0:41:17] <karl_rex> ME2 .... 2
[0:41:17] <%jillpilled> NEWERER GALAXY
[0:41:21] <Pookiedaexzile> What if Time tho
[0:41:22] <+JaseAdrift> We went to a new solar system pat
[0:41:22] <brisk_dacat> What if we went to@the snickers galaxy
[0:41:23] <+evbites> there still a bunch of sloar systems
[0:41:23] <AmuserName> The Terminus Systems (most of 2) is in the top right of the map.
[0:41:25] <%Arancet> they somehow managed to completely ruin an entire fictional UNIVERSE
[0:41:26] <jackelzxaa> 3 actually tells you the galaxy territories explicitly
[0:41:29] <+natedrago> hi reddit
[0:41:32] <peachy996> @PlagueOfGripes You come close in 2
[0:41:32] <%ThirdWelles> What if you went to the edges of the galaxy and it was all bounty hunting shit
[0:41:36] <@PlagueOfGripes> EDI still horny
[0:41:39] <%TheotherKristian> Not only did they fuck it up, they refused to resolve it
[0:41:39] <+Shaggnar> The reaper-reapers show up
[0:41:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Wrong
[0:41:41] <jackelzxaa> You actually get to know which ones are terminus and which ones are traverse
[0:41:45] <%ThirdWelles> Reapers *again*
[0:41:46] <Pookiedaexzile> He said Concil
[0:41:46] <%Pappajimbo> krogen look like space dinos naked
[0:41:49] <%scaryboisupreme> No one spoil 3, pay ain't played it yet rememrtr
[0:41:53] <DSD24> Pathfinders then
[0:41:55] <%Lizard0TM> Mass Relays will be destroyed Pat
[0:41:56] <+coldsama> Only EDI, Grunt and Liara are still alive
[0:41:57] <lyzejag> IS THIS DEATH STRANDING ???
[0:41:58] <stantheman_97> reapers... 2!
[0:41:58] <%Mekhet09> Time travel.
[0:41:59] <$Futurecity10> All the mass relays are destroyed in 3
[0:42:01] <T_Sasquatch> THAT'S NEVER A BAD IDEA
[0:42:02] <+megaman_sentinel> that sound like a bad idea
[0:42:03] <peachy996> So Pathfinders?
[0:42:03] <+aartbastiaan> Rachni 2.0
[0:42:06] <+JaseAdrift> Who's the Antagonist Pat?
[0:42:09] <Seshori> i thought the mass relays were destroyed in 3
[0:42:11] <+CammerTime21> Strand type game
[0:42:13] <%JohnAtDawn> YEAH THATS THE HALO PART
[0:42:14] <%X2Eliah> That sounds like what Andromeda SHOULD HAVE BEEN
[0:42:14] <+red_cuppa> find the rachni!!!!!!!
[0:42:15] <%scaryboisupreme> Can we blow up the Batarians again
[0:42:16] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I found an official looking 3D render of a nude krogan. Do you want me to post the link in chat?
[0:42:16] <+JaseAdrift> Pathfinders...
[0:42:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Wrong he said mass relay
[0:42:20] <peachy996> You're literally just describing Pathfinders
[0:42:20] <%JamesCorck> That it exists.
[0:42:21] <+ThomasOfTroy> That sounds terrible pat
[0:42:21] <@SSaryn> And then we fight the REAPERS
[0:42:21] <+aartbastiaan> but how the hell do you get a threat bigger than the Reapers
[0:42:21] <+abrupt_abe> And no matter what race you are, Shepherd is your ancestor
[0:42:22] <DSD24> So better ANdromeda
[0:42:22] <SummonerMagno> stargate atlantis??
[0:42:22] <+alphonseisbest> you go all over in 3 tho
[0:42:23] <%DrTomT18> My theory is that Mass Effect 4 will be a galactic civil war AGAINST the Council because thye dropped the fucking ball and are totally responsible for the Reaper invasion
[0:42:23] <%ThirdWelles> Civil war shit
[0:42:25] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Nope, all mass relays are destroyed in 3
[0:42:25] <%Garthunox> @scaryboisupreme he said he doesnt care for the most part afaik
[0:42:26] <@PlagueOfGripes> why does the music sound off key
[0:42:27] <Jane_Lo> guys, you saying "EDIT is still alive" she can die, don't forget about that
[0:42:29] <+D00msDayDan> pat you're starting to sound like woolie
[0:42:29] <@PlagueOfGripes> what is happening
[0:42:31] <%LumberjackJack> Then you can find new aliens or even ancient aliens hiding in isolation
[0:42:34] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[0:42:36] <Necnill> LUL
[0:42:38] <%ThirdWelles> Andromeda's biggest problem was Andromeda
[0:42:38] <+natedrago> LUL
[0:42:39] <peachy996> YUP
[0:42:39] <Jontman42> uh oh another hostile alien race that wants to conquer the galaxy as soon as we say hi
[0:42:41] <+Shaggnar> Also just the plot was just lackluster
[0:42:41] <jackelzxaa> Mass Effect 2 has you go to the center of the galaxy, they already nutted
[0:42:42] <Minorou> are we going to hold the line?
[0:42:42] <Alzero83> they fauked it up HARD
[0:42:46] <DatAsuna> Part of the problem with andromeda is that 99% of the andromeda galaxy is blocked off by plot gas
[0:42:50] <+MKUltima> What if they research a new technology that instead of a Relay, it uses Gates, and you get sent to a world that influenced Ancient Egypt
[0:42:51] <+megaman_sentinel> crazy talk?
[0:42:51] <Lamokmok> That's just Star Ocean 4 as well
[0:42:52] <%Retinolgaming> @PatStaresAt Technically andromeda only takes place in one small corner of the new galaxy
[0:42:53] <%scaryboisupreme> I want an Andromeda 2 just so they can fix it
[0:42:54] <+aartbastiaan> it's SO FUCKING STUPID that you go to a different galaxy only to find slightly different looking humans
[0:42:56] <%Lizard0TM> Mass Relays are destroyed in ME3 Pat
[0:42:56] <%Mr_Pylon> I want more non-humanoid aliens dammit
[0:42:57] <%Agami23> refresh plague, that happens when you lag abit and then it tries to catch up.
[0:42:58] <DatAsuna> You are stuck to one nebula
[0:42:59] <Pookiedaexzile> What if we just went onanother Path Finder Ship
[0:43:00] <jackelzxaa> Mass Effect 5 idea: connect andromeda to milky way so you can do pathfinders properly
[0:43:01] <$Ziegsy> again the only one in mass effect Id bone is normandy
[0:43:02] <%Nuclearcherries> Andromeda but done well this time
[0:43:03] <Pookiedaexzile> that was good
[0:43:04] <%Arancet> and they did NOTHING cool with it
[0:43:05] <$dalmek> @PlagueOfGripes if the audio keeps distorting, it might be a known Twitch bug with descync (so it could be just a refresh the page)
[0:43:05] <peachy996> And TTHEY FUCKED IT UP
[0:43:07] <stantheman_97> they fucked it up so bad
[0:43:07] <Pookiedaexzile> And had cool people
[0:43:09] <@SSaryn> And then it sucked ass
[0:43:10] <kifflomdolphin> @PlagueOfGripes Pat's trying to nut in Liara.
[0:43:10] <brisk_dacat> What if we just do hitchhiker galaxy travel
[0:43:12] <+YPFrost> w as there a new race in andromeda?
[0:43:13] <+megaman_sentinel> my face hurts
[0:43:14] <%X2Eliah> @PlagueOfGripes So Twitch is weird with audio, sometimes the audio files get out of sync just a tiny bit and the audio sounds warped as fuck. Usually a page refresh solves it
[0:43:15] <Ipsenscastle> @PlagueOfGripes I usually get that when my internet is slow, it warps the music to buffer - maybe your new internet is finding its feet
[0:43:15] <+Shaggnar> New ideas don't work if your new ideas suck
[0:43:17] <GandhiTheTerrible> Excellent idea, BAD execution
[0:43:17] <Alzero83> They Done Fauked it up
[0:43:17] <sweatch0> they doodoo feces'd it
[0:43:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> HUGE botch job
[0:43:20] <jackelzxaa> Have them open a super relay between systems so they can redo it
[0:43:21] <+LionKagura> Holy shit that crack LUL
[0:43:22] <+natedrago> you sound like you're in so much pain lmao
[0:43:22] <Pookiedaexzile> What if we went to a Cool Pathfinder Shi tho
[0:43:24] <@SSaryn> And had that dumbass Asari holding a pistol backwards.
[0:43:27] <+aartbastiaan> @YPFrost yes several, but all were just humanoids
[0:43:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> They could try again
[0:43:28] <@PlagueOfGripes> A shame Liara is the only romance option in ME1. Yup. The only one
[0:43:29] <DSD24> Cora was cool in Andromeda
[0:43:30] <%Lizard0TM> the new friendly aliens in Andromeda were SO LAME
[0:43:31] <DatAsuna> There were 2 new races @YPFrost
[0:43:33] <%LumberjackJack> Andromeda's plot was just ME1 with new, worse paint. It was... disappointing, to say the least
[0:43:34] <%Mekhet09> ME 4 is going to be time travel where you stop yourself from blowing up the relays. So ME5 can take place in the future.
[0:43:34] <Lamokmok> Totally fucked it up
[0:43:35] <+CaptainPearz> cus "bioware magic"
[0:43:35] <SaltyAzteca> 'Nothing bad will happen here'
[0:43:36] <karl_rex> Most of Andromeda's companions were pretty unlikeable
[0:43:37] <%Torus1025> Get Hype
[0:43:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Like the one with hookers
[0:43:40] <%DrTomT18> smart
[0:43:42] <jackelzxaa> Andromeda’s biggest problem: no drell, no quarians
[0:43:45] <viewtifulr> Hold the line moment
[0:43:46] <Pookiedaexzile> DO IT MORE
[0:43:46] <brisk_dacat> Pat shepherd will but in every alien race he can find
[0:43:47] <dd44dostivei> you should treat ashley to a good meal
[0:43:48] <%crimsong0ddess> crimsong0ddess subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Wooo!!!!
[0:43:50] <Necnill> Man, what happened to Seth Green
[0:43:51] <peachy996> A shame Liara can't be killed
[0:43:51] <jackelzxaa> V i r m i r e
[0:43:53] <+aartbastiaan> Halo 3 vibes
[0:43:54] <Ipsenscastle> Virmire's so fucking pretty
[0:43:55] <kifflomdolphin> WE HELD THE LINE!
[0:43:57] <+natedrago> rip quarian dlc
[0:43:59] <jackelzxaa> Time for the best 4 hours of mass effect
[0:43:59] <%DrTomT18> Shepards voice DOES NOT match Pats character
[0:43:59] <%jillpilled> Virmire's legit gorgeous
[0:44:00] <sweatch0> that shot was cool
[0:44:01] <+YPFrost> @aartbastiaan when will we get hot non humaniod aliens :(
[0:44:04] <%Daxalog> Oh. This mission.
[0:44:07] <TourettesPlays> im curious to see if you experience as many bugs on virmire as i did
[0:44:10] <SaltyAzteca> Wet Mako Kreygasm
[0:44:12] <%JohnAtDawn> good
[0:44:14] <jackelzxaa> You can switch party twice in virmire so you can hang with more pals
[0:44:14] <otakon17> funny thing is, you can DO Virmire before the last initial of the 3 quests
[0:44:14] <%sunsetdisc0> hot take: bioware should just continue from andromeda. no continuing off shepard's story, just continuing and improving what theyve already done. no sweeping under the rug
[0:44:14] <%AllenDeadman> it's time
[0:44:15] <iosephe> Good!
[0:44:15] <+natedrago> good fine
[0:44:16] <karl_rex> Its good
[0:44:16] <peachy996> Good
[0:44:16] <sweatch0> sound good
[0:44:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> Hey time to kill a racist
[0:44:16] <%moonmintparadise> good
[0:44:17] <DSD24> Nah Pat's character looks good
[0:44:17] <%echobee_tv> Sounds good.
[0:44:17] <$dalmek> sounds good
[0:44:17] <$Futurecity10> tad bit loud
[0:44:17] <%moonmintparadise> very good
[0:44:18] <stantheman_97> god damn joker that was close as fuck

[0:44:19] <%X2Eliah> Sound is good
[0:44:19] <%castlerock42> Good.
[0:44:19] <@SSaryn> Sounds pretty good.
[0:44:20] <+D00msDayDan> why isn't joker romancable
[0:44:21] <$Futurecity10> Like a tad
[0:44:21] <+aartbastiaan> @YPFrost Elcor Kreygasm
[0:44:21] <Jontman42> it good
[0:44:22] <+natedrago> sounds fine
[0:44:22] <Pookiedaexzile> You know there has to be a Pathfinder ship with criminals and coool people.
[0:44:22] <DatAsuna> TBF it makes even less sense that they were gonna do a quarian arc, becuase why would the quarians get included if the project happened between ME1-2?
[0:44:23] <+Deebo305> sounds fine
[0:44:23] <Aydarkzero> it's good
[0:44:23] <%AllenDeadman> it good
[0:44:23] <Srthunda> it sounds wet
[0:44:24] <%moonmintparadise> nah its fine
[0:44:24] <%LumberjackJack> Sound is ME1, so... fine
[0:44:24] <%coward_man> big good yes
[0:44:24] <@SSaryn> Nah no echo
[0:44:24] <SaltyAzteca> its good
[0:44:25] <otakon17> GOD I love that armor on Wrex
[0:44:25] <kifflomdolphin> It's nut
[0:44:28] <jackelzxaa> Joker is the best
[0:44:28] <%SABiscotti> Pat and his Big White Krogan

[0:44:37] <zanzibarian_hamster> It is acceptable
[0:44:37] <+ThomasOfTroy> Shoot a gun for loudness check
[0:44:39] <%X2Eliah> I KEEP HEARING A HUGE ECHO OF PAT SAYING "AGAINST THE LAW"
[0:44:40] <%Agami23> the game sounds abit loud compared to you, but i think that might just be me.
[0:44:44] <jackelzxaa> It sounds ok
[0:44:44] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> I'm no Narc. I'm not gonna say shit
[0:44:45] <%rockcentuar> GOOD
[0:44:51] <%Ynkubus_> Beach episode begins now!
[0:44:51] <plaguedoctor_syan> i mean you are not wrong
[0:44:53] <jackelzxaa> Pat wants the chat to narc on the sound
[0:44:58] <+aartbastiaan> what difficulty is he on?
[0:45:00] <+SilverDevilfish> Time to find the dumb former force people so we can get to the Starforge... wait wrong game
[0:45:01] <DatAsuna> Like a quarian arc would have been the silliest thing
[0:45:02] <+aartbastiaan> D:
[0:45:05] <jackelzxaa> Oh wow i thought pat would be 30 by now
[0:45:06] <Lamokmok> At least it looks pretty now.
[0:45:07] <%LumberjackJack> Virmire + Ilos are amazing, even today
[0:45:09] <otakon17> Virmire is GORGEOUS
[0:45:11] <Ipsenscastle> dont run over crab >:(
[0:45:12] <plaguedoctor_syan> just like how cop have to tell you if they are cops

[0:45:15] <otakon17> NO CRABBIES
[0:45:16] <%DrTomT18> true
[0:45:17] <Pookiedaexzile> True
[0:45:17] <%Gloom_Tangerine> @patstaresat why is liara not on nerd squad? She’s an actual archaeologist.
[0:45:20] <%JohnAtDawn> yes
[0:45:21] <otakon17> Crab friend!

[0:45:23] <signofzeta> ye makes sense
[0:45:26] <%jillpilled> Yeah I follow ya
[0:45:31] <%starlightvii> be a hero and respond to pat
[0:45:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> That water still looks excellent
[0:45:34] <%X2Eliah> Yeah basically. ME2's side assignment locations are very virmire-mini-like
[0:45:34] <%Rumbutt> iirc a lot of the preview stuff they showed for ME1 was Virmire
[0:45:36] <DSD24> Plus this song is good
[0:45:38] <jackelzxaa> Thats correct
[0:45:39] <+ThomasOfTroy> You probably don't
[0:45:44] <%Daxalog> What  is this landscape called? A Grotto?
[0:45:47] <%DrTomT18> do not
[0:45:48] <jackelzxaa> This is mass effect 1.5
[0:45:49] <%Garthunox> you wont
[0:45:53] <%bread_assassin> @PatStaresAt What class are ya gonna do?
[0:45:56] <+aartbastiaan> @Daxalog canyon
[0:46:00] <peachy996> It makes Peak 15 Real quick on Renegade
[0:46:00] <%Lizard0TM> please stream NG+
[0:46:04] <otakon17> just remember to use your Paragon save
[0:46:08] <+xerotwo> LUL
[0:46:08] <otakon17> for ME2 carryover
[0:46:08] <%Daxalog> Ah
[0:46:09] <%MidnightBurst12> D:
[0:46:11] <%AzureGale> Will the renegade playthrough have you being nice to Ashley
[0:46:12] <peachy996> Why talk when you can just hack
[0:46:13] <%NateyBeak> the crab! D:
[0:46:14] <Pookiedaexzile> Stream it
[0:46:17] <%DrTomT18> Renagade Shepard is mostly just a fucking asshole in 1, to a genocideal bastard in 3
[0:46:18] <AmuserName> Insanity Run?
[0:46:20] <%StaceMcGate> Pat, we both know you don't have it in your heart to be mean to NPCs
[0:46:23] <Lamokmok> RIP crab people
[0:46:27] <%Lizard0TM> NG+ renegade absolutely has enough content
[0:46:29] <jackelzxaa> Renegade shepard is ashleys best friend
[0:46:32] <%X2Eliah> Naw, Pat has already enough to stream
[0:46:37] <LluthyY> Not the crab boi!
[0:46:40] <%Dfreddy8> You think we come here for content?
[0:46:43] <%X2Eliah> Renegade is literally "Bad playthrough"
[0:46:45] <kifflomdolphin> Pat, you're gonna be a dick to everyone in the series? I'm down for that, stream that shit!
[0:46:51] <%LumberjackJack> Because you kill most of them on renegade, yup
[0:46:54] <jackelzxaa> Have you done femshep before?
[0:46:56] <+aartbastiaan> there is a hilarious renegade option on Noveria
[0:46:58] <%AzureGale> Elder Scrolls?
[0:47:01] <+Ghufufin> man he wasnt kidding about an early stream
[0:47:02] <%X2Eliah> Witcher?
[0:47:03] <%DrTomT18> Witcher?
[0:47:04] <+aartbastiaan> The Witcher 2 LUL
[0:47:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Paragon 1, Renegade 2
[0:47:06] <%JohnAtDawn> witcher
[0:47:08] <+IxDomxI> witcher?
[0:47:14] <jackelzxaa> Theres alot of super uniqur renegade scenes in 3 that you can only get by killing people in past games
[0:47:14] <DatAsuna> That's the problem with kotor dark side runs too, there's funny dark side and the boring [start combat] dark side
[0:47:16] <+arminscc> letho in W3 is amazing true
[0:47:18] <%X2Eliah> Yep
[0:47:19] <kifflomdolphin> Oh, he's talking about the Which Her: Wild Cunt
[0:47:21] <GandhiTheTerrible> I love Letho
[0:47:21] <Ipsenscastle> Renegade just kind of sucks - I appreciate knowing it's there, but frankly I'm probably going to play with the same choices every time I run through it
[0:47:22] <%jillpilled> Letho's a bro really
[0:47:23] <Virokwet> agreed
[0:47:26] <+evbites> @PatStaresAt why do people do the renegade/paragon runs only instead of doing a blend of both
[0:47:30] <+arminscc> so fucking glad I spared him
[0:47:33] <otakon17> Letho isn't that bad
[0:47:39] <%SABiscotti> MAN isn't Witcher 3 real fuckin good?
[0:47:41] <+ThomasOfTroy> Are there any good mods to unjankify the witcher 1?
[0:47:41] <DSD24> That's why you don't go full renegade
[0:47:42] <peachy996> Ron Perlman is a Witcher already
[0:47:42] <otakon17> you know despite basically framing you
[0:47:42] <+SinisterBroccoli> did you ever get the ending in dragon age origins where loghajn
[0:47:43] <Sunstalker> What if Vin Diesel and Ron perlman had a witcher baby
[0:47:47] <aiutare47> @evbites you are kinda penalized for doing both
[0:47:48] <%Nuclearcherries> I wish more RPGs had carry over stuff like Mass Effect
[0:47:49] <Pookiedaexzile> @evbites The game tells you not to
[0:47:50] <DSD24> You just be a dick to people who deserve it
[0:47:50] <%X2Eliah> There are SO many awesome things about the Witcher 2 & 3. It makes me so mad, how terrible Cyberpunk 2077 turned out
[0:47:51] <%scaryboisupreme> I wish there was another Mass Effect style space RPG love boat game
[0:47:52] <DatAsuna> @evbites because the game blocks off endings and outcomes if you do that
[0:48:00] <+MelodyMedley> Ah, it's this mission
[0:48:01] <+natedrago> shot gun rain
[0:48:03] <+aartbastiaan> scaling depends on the difficulty
[0:48:04] <+SinisterBroccoli> did you ever get loghain on your team in DA:O?
[0:48:04] <%AllenDeadman> @evbites if you don't pick one or the other you won't have enough points to make certain paragon or renegade options
[0:48:08] <jackelzxaa> ME3’s renegade shepard is probably the one where they actually thought of some cool things that paragons CANT get
[0:48:10] <%LumberjackJack> Geth were always weak, oddly enough
[0:48:11] <+MelodyMedley> Pat really is gonna finish ME1 today then
[0:48:14] <kifflomdolphin> Die, flashlight! Go back to your homeworld!
[0:48:15] <+evbites> @Pookiedaexzile well thats dumb it  rules
[0:48:16] <%AllenDeadman> unless you cheat in 2 and 3
[0:48:21] <plaguedoctor_syan> yhea, especially after what happend with that king that rapes Vas, i just though that i can´t judge with since i also killed him
[0:48:25] <%Dfreddy8> It's because it's on baby normal
[0:48:34] <DSD24> Reminder that the Cannons are just upside down Sniper Rifles in this mission
[0:48:35] <otakon17> yeah Sabotage, SWAP WEAPONS when that happens
[0:48:37] <%Lizard0TM> remember when I said you'd be drowning in IX and X weapons by Virmire? it's silly
[0:48:37] <SaltyAzteca> nailed it
[0:48:39] <+aartbastiaan> StinkyCheese
[0:48:40] <@PlagueOfGripes> Hack THIS (brap)
[0:48:41] <Seshori> first try
[0:48:43] <%MrBorisMakarov> LUL
[0:48:43] <aiutare47> Snowblind rounds are good
[0:48:44] <%Daxalog> They actually sped up the speed of their jumps.
[0:48:44] <%DrTomT18> Hey Pat, have found frictonless material upgrades yet? They can make it so you can fire your gun without it ever over heating
[0:48:45] <signofzeta> hacking finesse
[0:48:45] <Blank9> renegade 2 is fun
[0:48:49] <%tank7013> @evbites A lot of good outcomes are locked behind having high one or the other. Game unfortunately punishes you for playing gray
[0:48:49] <%justnathan18> I hope everyones doing well today
[0:48:51] <+LionKagura> StinkyCheese
[0:48:54] <%DaKnightWarrior> yes
[0:48:57] <otakon17> shoot
[0:48:59] <%chance_h> Great job
[0:48:59] <%Rumbutt> That hacking mini game is just a computer sperm trying to reach the egg
[0:49:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Renegade 2 is da bes
[0:49:04] <%AzureGale> No bork
[0:49:12] <+evbites> @tank7013 like what?
[0:49:13] <Pookiedaexzile> This was made first wasn't it
[0:49:15] <jackelzxaa> Red glow is gun overheat, green is powers overheat, and warp is “your damage resistance goes down”
[0:49:17] <+aartbastiaan> this inventory gives me PTSD, 1 hour between every mission dumping your vendor trash
[0:49:19] <@PlagueOfGripes> The X makes it better
[0:49:22] <DSD24> Renegade interrupts are fantastic in 2
[0:49:27] <%DrTomT18> put it on your shot gun bro
[0:49:30] <peachy996> This is the one game where High Explosive Rounds are COOL
[0:49:32] <DatAsuna> Remember when ME1 was supposed to have a no man's sky style procederually generated galaxy of planets? And then andromeda tried the same shit and had to cut it as well. lol
[0:49:35] <peachy996> 3 makes them suck
[0:49:36] <%DrTomT18> @DSD24 I do almost all of them. Almost
[0:49:36] <otakon17> EQUIP someone with Combat Optics X so your Radar stops being jammed by Hoppers
[0:49:40] <LluthyY> 2 has some amazing interrupts
[0:49:42] <%AzureGale> Bruh
[0:49:42] <%X2Eliah> game development?
[0:49:45] <%DrTomT18> good
[0:49:59] <jackelzxaa> Damage resistence is worth more than shields for not dying.  High damage protection can survive a direct cannon blast that high shields cant
[0:50:01] <%Dfreddy8> RUN IT OVER
[0:50:09] <DSD24> My favorite is pushing that dude outside the window, and snapping that other guys neck
[0:50:10] <%AzureGale> LUL
[0:50:10] <SaltyAzteca> '''''new'''''
[0:50:11] <+aartbastiaan> bruh

[0:50:26] <+aartbastiaan> that dude lying on the ground
[0:50:29] <Blank9> guilty gear strive bringing revolutionary nonfunctional lobbies
[0:50:31] <Pookiedaexzile> REally
[0:50:31] <DSD24> Is he like John with johns?
[0:50:40] <Pookiedaexzile> You wonder WHO started bruh
[0:50:42] <balthazar758> i mean
[0:50:43] <dd44dostivei> i think it's appropriated AA vernacular
[0:50:45] <balthazar758> bruh
[0:50:48] <%tank7013> @evbites Quite a few quests you can only get the best outcomes with morality locked dialogue options. In ME2 those options are the only way to solve some character disputes without making one of them mad at you. Things like that
[0:50:52] <jackelzxaa> Woah theres new folliage
[0:50:55] <+YPFrost> cavemen
[0:50:55] <bigshedman> Someone's brother, obviously

[0:51:04] <%Dfreddy8> Probably Shakespeare.
[0:51:06] <%AzureGale> They gotta be mocking dudebros initially right
[0:51:07] <otakon17> just run him over!
[0:51:09] <jackelzxaa> Virmire looks gorgeous now

[0:51:18] <%starlightvii> twas me I have a secret religion about it
[0:51:18] <%DrTomT18> Did you know that in Avengers End Game, the directors made the bold choice to use cameras to capture their actors on film?
[0:51:19] <SaltyAzteca> Oh no, not a circle! I cant beat that tactic!
[0:51:21] <jackelzxaa> Pat shove a geth collossus into water when you can
[0:51:23] <%AzureGale> To bruh or not to bruh
[0:51:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Bruh
[0:51:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> Hamlet was the original bruh moment
[0:51:36] <peachy996> Did the LE fix the high requirement for Jack vs Miranda or does that still suck?

[0:52:03] <DSD24> Done him in like Virtua Fighter
[0:52:08] <%MidnightBurst12> the sea has it now
[0:52:08] <+arminscc> THE MAKO DOESN'T CARE
[0:52:09] <jackelzxaa> Hahaha
[0:52:11] <%Mekhet09> The strongest weapon on the mako is the ram function.
[0:52:15] <+aartbastiaan> And they don't explode like atomic bombs like in ME2
[0:52:16] <kifflomdolphin> Guess sentient AI can't defeat water. What are they, the aliens from Signs?
[0:52:17] <%DrTomT18> I love the Mako
[0:52:18] <dd44dostivei> imagine walking through life at high levels
[0:52:22] <jackelzxaa> The mako is great i missed it in 2&3
[0:52:27] <stormhawk9891> Even the children? ESPECIALLY THE CHILDREN
[0:52:27] <otakon17> I LOVED running into Geth Weapon Platforms

[0:52:42] <+aartbastiaan> @dd44dostivei isn't that just age?
[0:52:43] <%Nuclearcherries> So how bad was the Mako in vanilla ME1?
[0:52:44] <%DrTomT18> @jackelzxaa God I fucking hate the Hammer Head
[0:52:45] <bigshedman> So Pat, what were you gonna say about game development?
[0:52:47] <%DrTomT18> so much
[0:52:50] <@PlagueOfGripes> The Geth can make a fine advanced AI warform. But can it deal with a dumb human pushing it into some water? No? Get fucked, humans rule
[0:52:54] <jackelzxaa> 3 shoulda had a vehicle since it was a *war game*
[0:52:54] <%SABiscotti> This is all gonna be way less funny in 20 years when we're all knocking Amazon Enforcement Drones into the ocean with our cars
[0:53:00] <%X2Eliah> @Nuclearcherries It bounced more and flipped / blew up easier
[0:53:00] <otakon17> well you're an ELITE SQUAD of soldiers
[0:53:05] <%AzureGale> As long as they're Legendary Edition Makos. Classic Makos would suck
[0:53:07] <$dalmek> always thank your brain
[0:53:10] <DSD24> Reusing assets
[0:53:12] <Jontman42> take your time Pat
[0:53:16] <%Mekhet09> The question is why aren't the geth able to hack the mako?
[0:53:17] <%Nuclearcherries> @Nuclearcherries Oh fuck, yeah that would do it

[0:53:53] <%jillpilled> PogChamp
[0:53:54] <peachy996> Wow
[0:53:55] <Pookiedaexzile> What?
[0:53:55] <otakon17> the LAST LAST planet?!
[0:53:55] <T_Sasquatch> I was joking LUL
[0:53:55] <%Nuclearcherries> Ilos?
[0:53:56] <jackelzxaa> This one
[0:53:56] <%Dfreddy8> 2004!!!
[0:53:57] <stantheman_97> really?
[0:53:57] <%Mekhet09> I said the last planet.
[0:53:58] <%DrTomT18> its Ilos, EYE-LOS
[0:54:00] <otakon17> I'm looking this up
[0:54:00] <%Nuclearcherries> Wack
[0:54:01] <solidus1992> thats dumb
[0:54:01] <+arminscc> weird choice
[0:54:04] <%Rumbutt> I remember a lot of Virmire stuff, this section in particular
[0:54:04] <Coystick> Is Illos the red one?
[0:54:06] <kifflomdolphin> Ilos? Really? That's both a spoiler and stupid as hell.
[0:54:14] <%AzureGale> It's not like people knew the plot relevance back then
[0:54:21] <jackelzxaa> Oh my god i saw the virmire demo but never saw the illos shot
[0:54:22] <%X2Eliah> LUL
[0:54:24] <%X2Eliah> oh god
[0:54:24] <+aartbastiaan> Liara?
[0:54:27] <%DrTomT18> Reapers aint real
[0:54:29] <peachy996> I remember when Therum was Caleston
[0:54:29] <%DrTomT18> shut up
[0:54:30] <dd44dostivei> an mark meer sounds better
[0:54:31] <DSD24> The Reapahs
[0:54:32] <wolverinewaswrong> the reapers are asically the bad guys from neverwinter nights
[0:54:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> Shepard, the Reapers
[0:54:38] <%strugglepunk2> Pat are you having a stroke?
[0:54:39] <Blank9> immediately just THE REAPERS and talking about cycles
[0:54:39] <%jillpilled> Ah yes, "reapers"
[0:54:39] <%AncelDeLambert> which one is Ilos?
[0:54:40] <Pookiedaexzile> Somebody got cut g
[0:54:40] <peachy996> And the commercial references Caleston
[0:54:41] <@PlagueOfGripes> Ah yes. The "Trailer."
[0:54:43] <hat_under_bread> Because sometimes you plan and build the coolest part of your game first.
[0:54:44] <%AzureGale> Ah, yes, "reapers"
[0:54:47] <%Dfreddy8> "Ah yes" "Reapers"
[0:54:48] <Blank9> like they just fully know but have no proof but really know
[0:54:54] <peachy996> But you never go to a planet called Caleston in gam
[0:54:54] <otakon17> GOD the original ME looked rough
[0:54:55] <jackelzxaa> Watch the sky when you drive through the gate to see a normandy
[0:54:55] <notsoy> are the reapers secretly Korean?
[0:54:55] <kifflomdolphin> Pat, the Reapers aren't real, just something Saren made up. The counsel told me so, it must be true.
[0:55:01] <aiutare47> Anderson just tells you about the Reapers in your second conversation ever with him. Like its just obvious to him that the elder gods are coming back
[0:55:01] <%mike2hands> Hello guy what did i miss
[0:55:13] <+tokenreefer> pat you got a dump
[0:55:17] <zanzibarian_hamster> @wolverinewaswrong Bioware has made exactly one game several times with a couple of different coats of paint
[0:55:17] <+evbites> no one listens
[0:55:24] <%Rumbutt> And we're coming up to it now
[0:55:25] <+arminscc> storywise ME1 is the best imo
[0:55:25] <@PlagueOfGripes> Reaper Milk is real and their babies LOVE it
[0:55:29] <%LumberjackJack> Reapers are space-Cthulu's
[0:55:39] <%DrTomT18> The problem with talking with Soveign is that his speech is so fucking cool that it can't possibly live up to the hype
[0:55:40] <%AzureGale> Yeahhhhhh facetank ALL the things
[0:55:41] <Minorou> Anderson's just got your back the whole time
[0:55:44] <jackelzxaa> This shotgun is so strong
[0:55:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> pat you're so strong
[0:55:45] <Minorou> what a bro
[0:55:46] <peachy996> Reaper Milk is people
[0:55:48] <%Mekhet09> I thought the High point was the suicide mission. But that cerb shit wasn't that great.
[0:55:49] <+ThomasOfTroy> I could go for some reaper mommy milkies
[0:55:49] <jackelzxaa> Hahaha
[0:55:54] <otakon17> oh god the ORIGINAL UI for the combat
[0:55:55] <Pookiedaexzile> Barrier
[0:55:58] <peachy996> Delicious Non-Fat People
[0:55:58] <%scaryboisupreme> Oh did pat get Wrex's armor
[0:55:58] <otakon17> it's so WEIRD looking
[0:56:01] <jackelzxaa> Shepard is the miniboss charging at the geth juggernaut
[0:56:03] <Pookiedaexzile> Barrier is skrong
[0:56:05] <%DrTomT18> @jackelzxaa Shot gun in all the ME games are pretty fucking great.
[0:56:06] <%Rumbutt> guide the cyber sperm to the computer egg Pat!
[0:56:11] <jackelzxaa> Wrex wishes he was as big as shepard
[0:56:16] <$LightningLynx89> I mean, I'd say ME2 has cooler moments than ME
[0:56:19] <%LumberjackJack> HEADBUTT THOSE ROCKETS
[0:56:20] <aiutare47> Thats what fighting Krogan was like for the Rachni
[0:56:20] <jackelzxaa> In me2 shotgun feels weird
[0:56:21] <%DaKnightWarrior> Samus style.
[0:56:23] <%AllenDeadman> anyone would shit their pants
[0:56:23] <%AzureGale> That would be pretty terrifying
[0:56:23] <%DrTomT18> 404: Error - BIOTICS TOO STRONK
[0:56:24] <otakon17> that's the beauty of IMMUNITY
[0:56:28] <wolverinewaswrong> @zanzibarian_hamster republic is the council, husks are darkspawn, morrigan is that drow from bg2
[0:56:30] <kifflomdolphin> Biotics are gay, guns are better
[0:56:31] <dd44dostivei> i mean we see sovereign tank dreadnaughts
[0:56:31] <%X2Eliah> Wrex has quads, Shep has Octos
[0:56:31] <@PlagueOfGripes> How does Wrex put on his armor? How does he do anything but just roll onto his back and pull hotdogs into his mouth
[0:56:33] <Pookiedaexzile> "LEARNED THIS FROM A KROGAN BACK IN 46"
[0:56:40] <+D00msDayDan> good thing the geth never worked out synthetic biotics
[0:56:42] <+natedrago> "Never be tougher than commander shepard"
[0:56:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> you don't even have to be a biotic to do that
[0:56:49] <%Agami23> one leg at a time
[0:56:50] <wolverinewaswrong> maybe it has buttons
[0:56:53] <+senfood> Very carefully.
[0:56:54] <%justnathan18> I bought bits just to give to Pat and I don't know how to fucking spend them
[0:56:54] <stantheman_97> just give up at that point
[0:56:55] <nuane> he doesnt take it off
[0:56:55] <Jontman42> Shepard can haul ass at anything with those pistons
[0:56:56] <Srthunda> like a vest, I bet
[0:56:58] <%MidnightBurst12> he doesn't
[0:56:58] <%Daxalog> Sideways
[0:56:58] <@PlagueOfGripes> How does Wrex type with those boxing gloves on?
[0:56:59] <otakon17> lol PlagueOfGripes GO TO SLEEP
[0:56:59] <%king_wragles> @PlagueOfGripes Slowly
[0:57:00] <Pookiedaexzile> One frog foot at a time
[0:57:02] <%DrTomT18> @LumberjackJack What do Rockets and Commander Shepard have in common? They leave nothing alive once they hit
[0:57:02] <peachy996> Salarian Captain is a cool
[0:57:06] <DSD24> Maybe its like a Iron Man suit
[0:57:08] <jackelzxaa> I think pat happened to not be looking at the normandy flyby
[0:57:11] <%SABiscotti> YE

[0:58:11] <+ThomasOfTroy> @justnathan18 I think it's "cheerX [insert message]" where x is how many you want to use
[0:58:18] <wolverinewaswrong> cultural studies
[0:58:19] <+aartbastiaan> Shepard is basically a Reaper doomsday weapon
[0:58:23] <jackelzxaa> The second best salarian in the series
[0:58:26] <wolverinewaswrong> he's researching literature
[0:58:26] <+xerotwo> monkaS
[0:58:29] <DSD24> Wrex why did you change your armor
[0:58:31] <jackelzxaa> There is no third best
[0:58:33] <satans_finest_millennial> EMBRACE THE LINEAR
[0:58:34] <Ipsenscastle> just throwing that out there at Wrex. jeez.

[0:58:38] <+arminscc> this shit blew my mind so hard back in the day
[0:58:39] <Jontman42> a final solution, if you will
[0:58:42] <%SABiscotti> What a way to put it, Wrex
[0:58:42] <bigfookinrat> the alien models in these games are so good
[0:58:44] <guiltyboya> "The Krogan Problem" Kappa
[0:58:44] <+D00msDayDan> if you somehow made it all the way here without finding out
[0:58:44] <+trackles_64> JUSTIFIED GENOCIDE
[0:58:46] <Coystick> Fuckin' Kr*gans
[0:58:46] <bigshedman> What's so important about curing this genociding disease Kappa
[0:58:46] <wolverinewaswrong> it takes balls to say that in front of wrex
[0:58:47] <%DrTomT18> @jackelzxaa Had to be me, someone else might have gotten it wrong
[0:58:48] <%AncelDeLambert> well DAMN
[0:58:50] <Pookiedaexzile> GOOD
[0:58:55] <balthazar758> damn wrex
[0:58:58] <Pookiedaexzile> LET THEM OVERRUN SHIT
[0:59:17] <+aartbastiaan> they were brutal to Krogan in ME1
[0:59:17] <jackelzxaa> Ashley thinking: “i have to kill wrex to protect humans”
[0:59:19] <%Movemeister> Let them nut
[0:59:20] <%Nuclearcherries> Wrex is correct
[0:59:26] <otakon17> Wrex saying "We are NOT a mistake" I feel that
[0:59:29] <%chance_h> We need a solution for Batarians -“Commander Shepard”
[0:59:32] <+RowenCleric> Wrex is my best friend/lover dont worry
[0:59:34] <%Nuclearcherries> Genocide is bad, hot take I know
[0:59:34] <otakon17> I wanna give the big guy a hug
[0:59:35] <%justnathan18> cheer500 I already donated and put messages in those, so I guess they will be read later. I bought these and didn't know how to use them. Thank you, Pat.
[0:59:35] <peachy996> SHOOT THE WATER WREX
[0:59:39] <%DrTomT18> They dont run it back, they just show you the other side of the argurment. You see what the Genophase has done to the Krogen
[0:59:42] <%Dfreddy8> They can OVERRUN me Kreygasm
[0:59:42] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Genocide is badass
[0:59:43] <Blank9> billions of krogans ARE a problem though
[0:59:45] <peachy996> SHOOT THE FUCK OUT OF THE WATER
[0:59:52] <Pookiedaexzile> "Yo Wrex lets fuck this bitc h over a get the cure"
[0:59:52] <%castlerock42> Not really. Salerians as a whole never ease up on the Genophage.
[0:59:54] <%SABiscotti> SHUT UP
[0:59:54] <%logoth_> Shepard
[0:59:55] <+CursedNobleman> friggin ash.
[0:59:55] <%scaryboisupreme> shut up ashley
[0:59:57] <$LightningLynx89> Pat billions of Korgan are a problem.
[0:59:58] <+newbroxes> That lightning effect is the exact same as the one of Duxun in Kotor 2
[0:59:59] <@PlagueOfGripes> Wrex, it's time for treats! Does Wrex want a treat!!!! Who's a good boy!!!
[1:00:01] <%knight1210> the korgan solution

[1:00:18] <%AzureGale> Who was that fellow in the water?
[1:00:20] <%Dfreddy8> Who is going with Kirriahe
[1:00:21] <%wibbwobbler> He’s right you know
[1:00:21] <%Mekhet09> Why didn't they just change the geno phage so that krogan had a reduction of ovem? Like why not just make them more like humans instead of make it so they couldn't repoduce?
[1:00:23] <Jontman42> sorry I can't let you save the Krogan because I love genocide
[1:00:24] <DSD24> Look at that Salarian chilling out in the back
[1:00:24] <%king_wragles> Doesn't he always look like that? I thought Krogan blood pressure was like a power washer
[1:00:26] <%DrTomT18> Mission amazing, you're the best Shepard!
[1:00:26] <%Rumbutt> FUCK YOU ASHLEY I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR SHOOTING WREX MY FIRST PLAYTHROUGH
[1:00:27] <otakon17> OH don't forget Rentola has some shop items
[1:00:27] <%justnathan18> Shes itching to shoot Wrex
[1:00:27] <%AllenDeadman> who are we killing anyways
[1:00:28] <peachy996> YEAH
[1:00:28] <viewtifulr> Soon
[1:00:29] <%knight1210> soon
[1:00:31] <+aartbastiaan> D: garrus
[1:00:31] <Srthunda> thats a cop way of thinking
[1:00:32] <%JamesCorck> If you don't shoot Shepard, Ashley shoots him for you and she's such a b-word when doing it.
[1:00:33] <wolverinewaswrong> Shoot wrex
[1:00:33] <SaltyAzteca> SHOTGUN THE BEACH WREX
[1:00:34] <+trackles_64> Shoot Wrex
[1:00:35] <+red_cuppa> lmao i love that he's just shooting into the water
[1:00:39] <$LightningLynx89> Ashley is not that bad
[1:00:41] <wolverinewaswrong> Give in to the renegade side
[1:00:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Ashley aint making it back to orbit
[1:00:42] <jackelzxaa> “Be ready to kill wrex for me, ashley”
[1:00:42] <solidus1992> Ashley is the WORST
[1:00:44] <peachy996> Wrex just shootin the water in the backround
[1:00:45] <+evbites> @Rumbutt thats rough
[1:00:46] <+RowenCleric> I would trust Wrex with my children
[1:00:48] <%justnathan18> That Salarian armor looks really cool
[1:00:49] <+red_cuppa> lmao wrex please!!
[1:00:50] <stantheman_97> give wrex a smooch
[1:00:51] <zanzibarian_hamster> "I'm always ready" translates to "I will kill a filthy alien for a corn chip"
[1:00:51] <%JamesCorck> She's not boring.
[1:00:53] <Ipsenscastle> Wrex is catching us some delicious fish
[1:01:00] <jackelzxaa> Liara is here somewhere too
[1:01:01] <%X2Eliah> Man I wish Wrex just started shooting salarians if you dawdled long enough
[1:01:01] <otakon17> REMEMBER send KAIDEN with the Salarians
[1:01:03] <%JamesCorck> Ashley is not boring, but she's far from being likeable.
[1:01:03] <otakon17> ARMALI
[1:01:05] <Minorou> I can never unsee the :D in the salarian armor
[1:01:06] <kifflomdolphin> Tali, your thoughts? "Genocide is rad" Thanks, i should go.

[1:01:12] <jackelzxaa> Good audio mixing Bioware
[1:01:17] <$LightningLynx89> So how come Tali gets a pass, but not Ashley? Tali supports literal genocide.
[1:01:18] <@PlagueOfGripes> Ashley knows a poem about racism. Did you know her grandfather was an orangutan?
[1:01:19] <%DrTomT18> HELL YEAH
[1:01:20] <%LumberjackJack> "I need to sell money

[1:02:06] <%JamesCorck> @JamesCorck Yeah, that's absolutely great how it does.
[1:02:07] <%Daxalog> Nah were good "saves"
[1:02:08] <dd44dostivei> it sucks that you have to be an engineer to get those crates
[1:02:10] <peachy996> He did
[1:02:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> @PlagueOfGripes "Facts concerning the Late Ashley Williams and Her Family"
[1:02:13] <+vaderxyz1970> I lost wrex on my first playthrough here :(
[1:02:15] <LluthyY> Yeah pat got his armor
[1:02:19] <+aartbastiaan> I 100% agreed with Wrex all throughout this
[1:02:25] <%valriot> This is the most one sided choice in all of ME LUL
[1:02:34] <%DrTomT18> Ashley does
[1:02:38] <DSD24> Ashley wants to
[1:02:40] <+trackles_64> I shoot him in the renegade run
[1:02:42] <%Mekhet09> Don't worry ashley will.
[1:02:43] <Sapphire_Breeze> except Ashley
[1:02:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Krogan did nothing wrong
[1:02:46] <T_Sasquatch> There's literally no reason
[1:02:48] <%DrTomT18> ashley is literally waiting to do it
[1:02:50] <%Dfreddy8> Ashley WILL
[1:02:54] <peachy996> Wrex is default dead if you didn't buy ME1
[1:02:55] <otakon17> seriously the only way it happens is if you don't have 12 Charm and don't do his Armor sidequest
[1:02:56] <kifflomdolphin> I don't know, Pat. Ashley wants to shoot Wrex
[1:02:56] <%jillpilled> This might be the biggest non choice in the series
[1:02:59] <peachy996> So I bought ME1
[1:02:59] <jackelzxaa> This bit gave me so much anxiety because i was scared i was gonna fuck it up so i was SUPER CAREFUL
[1:03:03] <%jillpilled> Wrex too good a boi
[1:03:07] <balthazar758> we friendos wrex
[1:03:08] <Jetsfantasy> Ashley literally has her finger on the trigger during the whole planet LUL
[1:03:09] <$LightningLynx89> Ashley merely hates Turians.
[1:03:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Even this game doesn't like genocide
[1:03:11] <jackelzxaa> I spent minutes on each choice
[1:03:13] <Zalapski> I shoot wrex every time -- keeps mordin alive!
[1:03:13] <BlackStarAura> I love you Wrex
[1:03:14] <brisk_dacat> But his entire race could be saved
[1:03:17] <Blank9> if saren could make a cure, anyone could make a cure
[1:03:17] <%chance_h> If I could I’d shoot Ashley twice and ask Wrex for a reload
[1:03:18] <+aartbastiaan> BibleThump
[1:03:19] <+DrGrudge> 978 andy LUL
[1:03:22] <+xerotwo> monkaS
[1:03:22] <+trackles_64> KIll Him D o IT
[1:03:25] <jackelzxaa> Ashley is right behind him holding five shotguns
[1:03:25] <SaltyAzteca> Thats the line
[1:03:27] <wolverinewaswrong> SHOOT
[1:03:30] <+aartbastiaan> LUL true
[1:03:36] <+Gamingand808s> the big choice
[1:03:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Wrex's actor deserve award
[1:03:43] <+MelodyMedley> Very true
[1:03:43] <@PlagueOfGripes> He's a professional
[1:03:46] <+aartbastiaan> Wrex just trying to save his species
[1:03:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> you always draw your shotgun here I think
[1:03:50] <jackelzxaa> Wrex has so much fucking good me3 content
[1:03:51] <%JamesCorck> That pause is so good.
[1:03:52] <peachy996> He has his pistol out
[1:03:53] <+natedrago> talk no justu success
[1:03:55] <thelonechris> They took his balls
[1:03:55] <chimeraxmachina> Kiss
[1:03:55] <wolverinewaswrong> Hehehe neutered
[1:03:56] <%AzureGale> And Wrex has a dinky little pistol
[1:03:56] <DSD24> I'm glad Shepard has that line
[1:03:58] <viewtifulr> pistol wrex
[1:04:01] <jimster40k> Click on the gun, then click on your Krogan.
[1:04:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I fucking love Wrex
[1:04:03] <%JamesCorck> That five second pause before Wrex answers, is so good.
[1:04:04] <sajuk_khar> So anticlimactic
[1:04:04] <%kewlmyc> Can you actually kill Wrex in this scene?
[1:04:05] <dalish2k> now kiss
[1:04:05] <Coystick> He good boi
[1:04:06] <%Daxalog> Im shocked that in my playthrough ashley killed him in 1 shot.
[1:04:06] <%AzureGale> DIALOGUE CHECK PASSED
[1:04:07] <otakon17> @jackelzxaa I LOVE Wrex in ME3, him and Eve are great
[1:04:08] <kifflomdolphin> Didn't need a speech check, nice.

[1:04:14] <DSD24> @kewlmyc Yes
[1:04:14] <%scaryboisupreme> HERO MUSIC
[1:04:15] <%StrawberryPantsu> That was kinda anti climactic...
[1:04:17] <%SABiscotti> Absolutely, Wrex
[1:04:18] <%MrBorisMakarov> YEAHHH
[1:04:19] <+aartbastiaan> saving the Krogan is one of the things you just have to do
[1:04:19] <%jillpilled> Wrex you don't even use pistols, come on man you're not doing shit bud
[1:04:20] <karl_rex> BIG Paragon points

[1:04:21] <spongeofmystery> "Help me out here Shepard" etc is a really good line
[1:04:23] <notsoy> yes, you can kill wrex if you're stupid and mean
[1:04:24] <SaltyAzteca> UNCA WREX BibleThump
[1:04:24] <@PlagueOfGripes> Wrex gets a treat

[1:04:29] <Sapphire_Breeze> @PatStaresAt can you show the other option for funsies
[1:04:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @kewlmyc yes or sometimes Ashley shoots him
[1:04:29] <kifflomdolphin> @kewlmyc Yes, 100%. You can even order Ashley to do it for you.
[1:04:29] <%DrTomT18> Fuck Ashley that is all
[1:04:29] <+CursedNobleman> IRONSIDE SIREN
[1:04:30] <+vaderxyz1970> soon

[1:04:30] <+evbites> @peachy996 shes mopeing
[1:04:30] <zanzibarian_hamster> Man Shepard really has that "cop from freakazoid" power, huh?
[1:04:30] <LluthyY> Ashley sad she doesnt get to murder

[1:04:37] <%Dfreddy8> SEND KAIDEN WITH KIRRIAHE
[1:04:38] <+xerotwo> I didn't get this part, ASHLEY RUINED IT FOR ME NotLikeThis
[1:04:38] <%coward_man> I remember doing that scene the first time and Ashley fucking killed him and I was done with her
[1:04:38] <SaltyAzteca> Can you feel the timer on Ashley chat?
[1:04:38] <bellmorgu> Hold the line!
[1:04:39] <%logoth_> Wrex gets Saren's head, as a treat
[1:04:40] <+MelodyMedley> SOON
[1:04:42] <stantheman_97> what if Ashley shot him right here
[1:04:42] <%Deano8817> Kirrahe's a chad
[1:04:48] <jackelzxaa> The renegade ending for wrex in me3 is probably the evilest shit in the world
[1:04:48] <%hrbeck_> waaaaaat? anti-climatic~? I don't know what you mean
[1:04:49] <%MugenSandan> psaBig psaBig psaBig SOON

[1:04:57] <Coystick> He's a Brogan first, a Krogan second.
[1:04:57] <Sapphire_Breeze> shut up Ashley
[1:04:58] <%logoth_> Shut up ashley
[1:04:58] <%justnathan18> Stick to the PLAN, Shepard! Tahiti!
[1:04:59] <otakon17> I like Kirrahe but him dismissing Wrex repeatedly pisses me off
[1:05:00] <jackelzxaa> It actually makes your shepard seem like a manipulative psychopath
[1:05:01] <%Garthunox> thing is, since ashley will kill him if you fail to talk him down, a lot of people will kill ashely in return if they dont already hate her before
[1:05:02] <thelonechris> Shut up bitch
[1:05:03] <+aartbastiaan> "turian ass"

[1:07:27] <%AllenDeadman> this isn't the big choice
[1:07:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SEND KAIDEN TO SAVE KIRAHE3
[1:07:31] <%X2Eliah> yeeeeeeeee
[1:07:31] <peachy996> Ash must arm the bomb away from the Salarians
[1:07:31] <%SABiscotti> and NOT racist
[1:07:32] <+aartbastiaan> NOOO then you have to keep Ashley around
[1:07:32] <iosephe> hahahaaa
[1:07:33] <$apolitenoob> Send the racist
[1:07:34] <T_Sasquatch> Ashely MUST LIVE
[1:07:34] <mrtRoll001> Sacrifice Ashley
[1:07:37] <$LightningLynx89> No one knew Pat, hence why more people kept Ashley alive than Kaiden
[1:07:39] <%AzureGale> F
[1:07:39] <%justnathan18> Goooooood luck Ashley
[1:07:40] <+evbites> and not racist
[1:07:41] <+tigerfang86> the unlikability is so huge
[1:07:42] <DSD24> Ash has some likable parts
[1:07:42] <Blank9> either will be fine, commander, you don't seem to care about them
[1:07:43] <+MelodyMedley> Kaiden will do great
[1:07:44] <viewtifulr> yeah sacrifice
[1:07:44] <%NateyBeak> WE HAVE PLANS FOR HER
[1:07:45] <+aartbastiaan> This option doesn't matter by the way
[1:07:45] <+LionKagura> NOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:07:47] <+vaderxyz1970> im gettting mixed signals here
[1:07:47] <zanzibarian_hamster> er...specist
[1:07:47] <%scaryboisupreme> Make sure you don't mess up and get them all killed
[1:07:48] <%king_wragles> "We'd prefer to sacrifice the racist, commander"
[1:07:48] <Pookiedaexzile> WAHT
[1:07:49] <+CursedNobleman> SHE MUST WIN.
[1:07:50] <Necnill> They're both the worst, tbf. Impossible choice
[1:07:50] <%X2Eliah> @AllenDeadman No, but kirrahe is at risk if you go save the bomb person
[1:07:54] <%justnathan18> Sending Kaiden makes sense. At least hes an officer.
[1:07:54] <+LionKagura> send ashley to her death
[1:07:55] <peachy996> Keep it simple and boring as always Alenko
[1:07:58] <RedPlasticCup> this isn't the choice dummy
[1:07:58] <otakon17> @aartbastiaan no, now you can go rescue Kaiden and the STG and leave Ashley to blow up with the bomb
[1:07:59] <Pookiedaexzile> I want her blood now
[1:07:59] <jackelzxaa> Yeah.  Kaiden is a good boy
[1:08:00] <%DrTomT18> Throw Ashley out the Normandy into nuke blast
[1:08:00] <Chaos_Aether> well bye carth
[1:08:01] <%scaryboisupreme> Yeah sure lmao
[1:08:01] <%coward_man> we can't trust that Ashley wont shoot them in the back
[1:08:03] <%Garthunox> Kaidan outranks Gunnery fuckin Sergeant Williams
[1:08:04] <%jillpilled> This isn't the option btw
[1:08:05] <%hrbeck_> "I like the female- she has bloodlust and finds me diusgusting, that is my species' 'thing'"
[1:08:12] <jackelzxaa> Canadian Carth
[1:08:15] <%DrTomT18> it is. Mordin is always stylish
[1:08:15] <SpaceGuntank> fall back to escape the blast? its a NUKE!
[1:08:16] <%Garthunox> Gunnery Chief*
[1:08:17] <%SirGO0SE> yes Ashely is an acceptable casualty i agree
[1:08:18] <%hrbeck_> THAT'S NOT A PLAN
[1:08:18] <+evbites> Why do people hate kaiden he's great
[1:08:19] <%scaryboisupreme> "We're gonna outrun a nuke it'll be cool"
[1:08:20] <RedPlasticCup> this determines who goes with the salarians and who goes with the bomb
[1:08:20] <otakon17> Salarian armor is pretty neat
[1:08:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> If you send her with the salarians, her death doesn't even get a cutscene
[1:08:23] <aiutare47> its got the weird towel rack thing on the chest
[1:08:23] <%justnathan18> The quartermaster dudes black armor is cool af
[1:08:25] <%ingman112> We’re gonna OUTRUN THE NUKE
[1:08:27] <DSD24> What are we some kind of Suicide Squad
[1:08:28] <peachy996> I like the Helmet but they got rid of it later
[1:08:28] <Zalapski> kaiden is worst character by far, bye bye
[1:08:29] <Ipsenscastle> I never understood why Salarian armour has a little gamecube handle at the front
[1:08:29] <@PlagueOfGripes> The only downside is that you might get flaming Ashley bits stuck to your windshield as you fly away
[1:08:29] <+aartbastiaan> @otakon17 the STG survives if you do enough quest objectives, regardless of where you go
[1:08:30] <+StoopKid241> No that's ME2
[1:08:33] <+Ropcord> i still don't know why they all have the chest handle
[1:08:35] <otakon17> @DrTomT18 Mordin uses a modified Scientist outfit
[1:08:35] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt You meant the handlebar connecting the two nipples?
[1:08:36] <%knight1210> he said it
[1:08:37] <%DrTomT18> @ReallyBigRocks Good.
[1:08:38] <dd44dostivei> i like that the game gives you a fake sacrifice decision, so that you can get a do over
[1:08:42] <otakon17> @aartbastiaan huh I had no idea
[1:08:50] <%DrTomT18> @otakon17 I think he has cybernetic arms?
[1:08:53] <T_Sasquatch> @evbites he has zero personality unless you talk to him alot
[1:08:54] <+xerotwo> WHAT AM I FIGHTING FOOOOOR?!?!
[1:08:55] <DSD24> Shadow means Strand
[1:08:56] <stantheman_97> helmet is alright but yeah
[1:08:57] <balthazar758> @PlagueOfGripes space wipers
[1:08:57] <+pre10cious_1> Say the line Pat!!
[1:08:58] <@PlagueOfGripes> Do you think some Krogan installed a whole row of balls? Like a 12 pack of nuts? A shade ball pool's worth of testicles?
[1:09:01] <signofzeta> this mission made me love salarians
[1:09:04] <jackelzxaa> It woulda been rad if mordin had full salarian armor as a bonus costume in 2
[1:09:08] <%AzureGale> Who's in Team Sonic, Team Rose, and Team Chaotix?
[1:09:14] <%SABiscotti> Does Kirrahe die if you miss even one of the upcoming side quests?
[1:09:14] <otakon17> @DrTomT18 it's possible, but never mentioned.
[1:09:17] <thelonechris> "Does it go boom?"
[1:09:17] <Pookiedaexzile> Not gonna lie I got so wrapped up I thought shepard would headshot her after this covo
[1:09:25] <%DrTomT18> @signofzeta I played ME2 before 1, so I fell in love with Mordin
[1:09:25] <DSD24> @SABiscotti Yes
[1:09:35] <+evbites> @T_Sasquatch oh you mean you have to talk to him how terrible
[1:09:37] <%SABiscotti> @DSD24 Jesus
[1:09:38] <peachy996> Save this Dude!
[1:09:38] <%Ynkubus_> @probably, maybe even shakes one and asks it questions
[1:09:39] <Chaos_Aether> lets rock and roll
[1:09:45] <%Garthunox> imagine if ashely just failed to fuckin arm it
[1:09:46] <%justnathan18> @PlagueOfGripes Do you think that Krogan have internal or external testicles?
[1:09:46] <Minorou> "fine"
[1:09:47] <%DrTomT18> but Mordin is a fucking weirdo even by his own peoples standards
[1:09:48] <peachy996> Fuckin love Kirrahe
[1:09:50] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Pat make sure to hit all the optional objectives on the path.
[1:09:55] <+D00msDayDan> time to hold that line
[1:09:59] <DSD24> I did all the side missions but one and yet that's the one that keeps Kirrahe alive
[1:09:59] <%Deano8817> "we"
[1:10:00] <otakon17> Kirrahe is a bro
[1:10:01] <Coystick> Got so used to that Shep peener
[1:10:03] <%SABiscotti> Yeah, Ash. We.

[1:10:13] <DSD24> These are some death flags

[1:11:57] <dirtyh4rr1> HODINE
[1:11:58] <%justnathan18> I love that one of the best speeches in this game goes to a seemingly random Salarian officer. Like its right up there with Shepards original speech once he takes over

[1:12:23] <%NopeBadguy> Hey, chat, help me out. A friend gifted me Legendary and IDK what class I wanna play. Soldier, Vanguard, or Infiltrator.
[1:12:25] <SaltyAzteca> Strap in, this is gonna be a long one
[1:12:26] <jackelzxaa> Yeah chaos, pat and ashley both shot wrex
[1:12:27] <DeepPix3l> AT SUMMERSLAM We will hold the line!
[1:12:29] <jackelzxaa> It was a tragedy
[1:12:30] <Chaos_Aether> damn
[1:12:37] <zanzibarian_hamster> Wrex sex will kill you and not in the pelvis crushing fun way though
[1:12:37] <%DrTomT18> @NopeBadguy Vanguard
[1:12:39] <Wolfstriker121> agreed make sure he makes it out alive <3
[1:12:40] <+evbites> @NopeBadguy soldier is great.
[1:12:41] <DSD24> @NopeBadguy Infiltrator!
[1:12:41] <%X2Eliah> @NopeBadguy Infiltrator is great in all 3 games
[1:12:41] <%LumberjackJack> What were the marks to save Kirrahe? Transmitter 1 and 2, rocket drones, and alarms?
[1:12:42] <$SGrim> Ah good, I'm in time for the execution
[1:12:43] <+alphonseisbest> @NopeBadguy VANGOD ALL DAY!
[1:12:47] <mrtRoll001> 'sup
[1:12:54] <Pookiedaexzile> "I've never seen Shepard use Cover in all the years working with him"
[1:12:56] <%DrTomT18> Very fast paced action class
[1:12:57] <otakon17> DAMN even the Destroyers aren't a match for that shotty
[1:12:59] <jackelzxaa> Pat make sure to do the objectives
[1:13:00] <firewhiskeys> @NopeBadguy vanguard sucks in me1, but i love it otherwise. infiltrator is really dope though.
[1:13:00] <spongeofmystery> @NopeBadguy Infiltrator is fun one you soup up sniper rifles and one shot everything
[1:13:06] <+evbites> @NopeBadguy honestly just pick one it's all good
[1:13:06] <jackelzxaa> There are 3 named spots on the map
[1:13:08] <peachy996> I think it's pretty cool Mordin, Kirrahe and Wiks all know each other since they're pretty much top 3 Salarians in the trilogy
[1:13:08] <+aartbastiaan> @LumberjackJack only the rocket drones matter for captain kirrahe
[1:13:14] <AmuserName> Tali, put away that rifle! LUL
[1:13:18] <mrtRoll001> Is this the final mission?
[1:13:18] <%ScottishMadJacko> Guys, i think he gets it, chill
[1:13:20] <aiutare47> @NopeBadguy All are good, Soldier is simplest, its just a TPS, infiltrators are eh in 1 but great in 2 and 3, vanguards are fun in all 3
[1:13:21] <Wolfstriker121> soldier is good in insanity?  anyone can confirm or no
[1:13:22] <%SABiscotti> Yeah
[1:13:23] <%castlerock42> Yup.
[1:13:24] <%X2Eliah> YES
[1:13:24] <otakon17> yeah
[1:13:26] <%X2Eliah> CORECT
[1:13:30] <+Deebo305> @nopebadguy Infiltrator is easy mode especially since ME1 has alot of technology based enemies and hacking
[1:13:31] <+aartbastiaan> the refueling is what saves Kirrahe, nothing else
[1:13:31] <ChungusQuest> @Pookiedaexzile Shepard *is* the cover for the rest of team
[1:13:34] <Lamokmok> Lol
[1:13:36] <aiutare47> @Wolfstriker121 Absolutely
[1:13:39] <%DrTomT18> you have to hit the refueling platform, it is super easy to miss
[1:13:40] <otakon17> Did you FINALLY give Tali her AI Hacking?
[1:13:43] <AmuserName> SourPls
[1:13:45] <@PlagueOfGripes> "Ashley Ground Zero" What does this map marker mean
[1:13:48] <DSD24> Gotta make sure you save Kirrahe
[1:13:51] <seniormeatbox> big help
[1:13:57] <+xerotwo> I'm helping! :)
[1:14:01] <%ingman112> There’s the music
[1:14:05] <+aartbastiaan> @aiutare47 what?? in 1 infiltrators roll through even on insanity
[1:14:06] <spongeofmystery> Okay that shotgun is DAFFY
[1:14:10] <seniormeatbox> man explosive ammo just annhihilates them
[1:14:11] <+liquidzr0> SourPls
[1:14:13] <%MrBorisMakarov> man EA needs to give me wall running mass effect
[1:14:14] <jackelzxaa> Yeah, two towers and a fuel depot and then the base at the end is the 4th part of the “side quest”
[1:14:21] <+aartbastiaan> @aiutare47 your weapons basically never overheat
[1:14:22] <otakon17> it's a SPECTRE Shotty
[1:14:25] <ChungusQuest> The kind of reaction speed only a synthetic can achieve
[1:14:29] <@PlagueOfGripes> most advanced robots ever made. but you have a large stick
[1:14:31] <%DrTomT18> big shoot bang
[1:14:32] <%coward_man> god the remaster team did a great job with this
[1:14:33] <seniormeatbox> is anyone else hearing slight distortion from the music?
[1:14:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> bang bang
[1:14:42] <otakon17> they're not THAT advanced
[1:14:43] <%JoshManVGH> Did they not record any lines for Kaiden for this section?
[1:14:46] <%SirGO0SE> me :)
[1:14:47] <%DrTomT18> stuff just explodes around Shepard
[1:14:48] <SaltyAzteca> what?
[1:14:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> good job idiots
[1:14:57] <otakon17> EXPLOSIONS!
[1:14:58] <jackelzxaa> Every time kirahe talks its because an objective is nearby
[1:14:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Barrier go Blue
[1:15:01] <+aartbastiaan> huh that was bugged
[1:15:03] <%DrTomT18> like the Punisher Crime Field
[1:15:03] <%ingman112> I’d bet tali
[1:15:09] <spongeofmystery> Shepard's class is now "Collateral damage"
[1:15:11] <peachy996> Things blow up around you
[1:15:14] <%X2Eliah> I genuinely love that we now have a full ME 1-2-3 game with all the bits and pieces that runs like NOT JANK
[1:15:16] <ScreamLord> That nuke ends up being WAY bigger than 20-Kilotons. You can see it from orbit and the explosion would wipe Texas off our maps
[1:15:17] <aiutare47> @aartbastiaan They were generally forgettable to me in 1, I ran through 2 and 3 on all difficulties with Infil and had a great time of it though.
[1:15:23] <bigshedman> @seniormeatbox It's probably from the way that Twitch makes streams catch up from slight delays. It can distort music and sound.
[1:15:29] <peachy996> In fact a Batarian says as much in ME2
[1:15:33] <%NateyBeak> Pat sheperd is a lawnmower and everyone else is the grass
[1:15:33] <ChungusQuest> really filling those action hero shoes
[1:15:34] <%JoshManVGH> Ah there we go
[1:15:34] <DeepPix3l> Pats biotic are so strong shit just explodes in his vicinity
[1:15:43] <otakon17> @X2Eliah ME1 is still a LITTLE jank but no where NEAR as jank as the original release
[1:15:44] <%NopeBadguy> IDK, I dunno what to decide on my class because I know I want to be a GUN class but IDK if I wanna specialize or mix
[1:15:47] <BlackStarAura> Pat, make sure you kill that scientist lady in Saren’s base. It helps with ME3 War Assets
[1:15:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Stop arguing over ME2 classes, Blue Jumpy or nothing
[1:15:55] <%DrTomT18> that was close
[1:15:58] <jackelzxaa> Pat MIGHT hit cap for how many enemies they throw at your dick in these last 3 segments of the game
[1:15:59] <mrtRoll001> looks like the geth destroyer got destroyed
[1:16:01] <%X2Eliah> yeah, exactly. They brought up ME1 to be decent
[1:16:06] <DSD24> @BlackStarAura That lady sucks ass
[1:16:08] <+aartbastiaan> shoot the tank
[1:16:12] <big_ol_bort> :)
[1:16:12] <Ipsenscastle> dying
[1:16:19] <%DrTomT18> Imagine seeing this from the Geth perspective
[1:16:23] <+aartbastiaan> @aiutare47 I'm playing ME2 as infiltrator after playing 1 on infiltrator, both on insanity, and imo it was waay easier in ME1
[1:16:25] <seniormeatbox> ethan winters moment
[1:16:25] <otakon17> YOU WERE TAKING HEALTH DAMAGE
[1:16:26] <Wolfstriker121> MICHAL BAY
[1:16:26] <jackelzxaa> Pat’s gonna have so many import bonuses
[1:16:34] <Minorou> yep
[1:16:35] <otakon17> oh yeah
[1:16:35] <%DianaTheAscian> I assume this sequence has different results depending on how well you do?
[1:16:36] <jackelzxaa> Shoot the fuel tank pat
[1:16:36] <%X2Eliah> yeah
[1:16:38] <%X2Eliah> kinda
[1:16:40] <peachy996> I mean you don't have to
[1:16:41] <otakon17> she end up indoctrinated
[1:16:41] <%DrTomT18> Just an unkillable human tanking everything you throw at him no problem
[1:16:42] <+Ropcord> if she lives until 3 she does a terrorism
[1:16:42] <DSD24> That lady is a massive Jerk too
[1:16:45] <%X2Eliah> ITS NOT A BIG DEAL THO
[1:16:45] <Minorou> kill scientist lady, she's indoctrinated
[1:16:47] <%DrTomT18> You got everything pat, good job!
[1:16:47] <DatAsuna> She kills people in ME3 if you don't
[1:16:48] <%bread_assassin> IF you don't she kills a bunch of people in 3.
[1:16:48] <jackelzxaa> Yaayyy explosion
[1:16:50] <peachy996> It's that big of an issue if you do or don't
[1:16:52] <%LumberjackJack> You're good so far!
[1:16:52] <+Deebo305> Jesus christ, Pat wearing Tech Armor before ME2
[1:16:54] <%X2Eliah> You did the flyers too
[1:16:55] <otakon17> the next one is the alarm by the door
[1:16:56] <jackelzxaa> Uh
[1:16:56] <seniormeatbox> if she lives se fucks up things in 2 that fucks things in 3
[1:16:56] <peachy996> It's not
[1:16:57] <%X2Eliah> You did all 3
[1:17:02] <otakon17> GO TO THE DOOR UNDER THE PLATFORM
[1:17:03] <+D00msDayDan> you can kill her later in 2
[1:17:03] <AmuserName> Journal might say the optional objectives
[1:17:04] <%ingman112> You’re good
[1:17:04] <kylejburke> @DianaTheAscian yeah, kirrahe can die
[1:17:05] <spongeofmystery> Rana Thanoptis? She a bad thing for ME3?
[1:17:06] <%NateyBeak> loudest beach ever
[1:17:07] <RedPlasticCup> its just flavor text, no effect on the WAR NUMBER
[1:17:07] <%SABiscotti> You got 3/3 for the approach, just the one at the base now
[1:17:08] <soundcloud_raptor> wrex
[1:17:11] <aiutare47> @aartbastiaan being able to cloak out of bad positioning as well as getting a massive damage boost was really nice
[1:17:11] <Wolfstriker121> how many bonuses pat is gonna have for me2
[1:17:16] <srv4254> beach asmr
[1:17:18] <%ingman112> Backseat chat is in FULL effect
[1:17:18] <%DianaTheAscian> @kylejburke k
[1:17:23] <%DrTomT18> I never even bothered to give Wrex biotic abilities, I put everything on his combat skills
[1:17:24] <peachy996> Oh yeah you can kill Rana later in 2 anyway
[1:17:24] <otakon17> oh cool you DID put points into hacking nice
[1:17:24] <jackelzxaa> The scientist lady shows up in 2
[1:17:27] <Iwashi94> LUL
[1:17:33] <+Ropcord> WOO BIG NUMBERS
[1:17:35] <peachy996> Kill her in 2
[1:17:35] <jackelzxaa> Her cutscene is worth keeping her alive for
[1:17:36] <%walternatorz> number go up no more
[1:17:37] <+xerotwo> LUL
[1:17:37] <%AzureGale> Damage goes brrrrrr
[1:17:37] <%DrTomT18> KILL HER
[1:17:38] <%X2Eliah> So, infiltrator is pretty strong regardless, and if you can hit headshots, it is the best clas
[1:17:39] <%DrTomT18> NO KILL HER
[1:17:44] <%ScottishMadJacko> yeah makes sense
[1:17:45] <Pookiedaexzile> Lift still over here strugglin
[1:17:45] <%DrTomT18> KIILLLL HEEERRR
[1:17:48] <+spartanluchador534> except those batarians
[1:17:48] <signofzeta> Maximum content
[1:17:49] <+aartbastiaan> paragon Shep wouldn't just execute a scientist tbf
[1:17:51] <%Dfreddy8> THAT'S ALOT OF DAMAGE
[1:17:52] <$SGrim> Make love to Wrex to restore the integrity of the Krogan race
[1:17:53] <Wolfstriker121> NO SPACE ASH
[1:17:54] <jackelzxaa> You cant kill rana in 2
[1:17:55] <+trackles_64> Everyone except ashley

[1:17:55] <BlackStarAura> ME2 didn’t let me kill her’
[1:17:58] <Zeif00> Except those people she kills
[1:18:01] <seniormeatbox> @PatStaresAt is master overkill broken on PC as well? it doesn't stop heatbuildup on xbox
[1:18:01] <%Nuclearcherries> Big Damage!!!
[1:18:02] <Wolfstriker121> like shoot her into space lol
[1:18:05] <DatAsuna> Gamespot did an LP with everyone dead and boy does that get weird.
[1:18:07] <%DrTomT18> Also, Shepards shotgun rn is a war crime
[1:18:07] <%AzureGale> GOTEM
[1:18:09] <DSD24> Yeah but the Scientist was torturing Salarians
[1:18:10] <+aartbastiaan> Hold the line
[1:18:11] <spongeofmystery> More like Kro-GONE
[1:18:12] <+CursedNobleman> HOLD
[1:18:13] <%justnathan18> hooooold
[1:18:15] <%Movemeister> HOLD THE LINE
[1:18:17] <otakon17> go SOUTH and UNDER Pat to get to the holding cells
[1:18:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HOLD THE LINE
[1:18:17] <AluxStreams> that was a good one pat
[1:18:18] <SaltyAzteca> BibleThump you hold that line
[1:18:20] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Honestly do whichever, just in ME3 read the War Assets text to see how all your decisions panned out
[1:18:20] <BlackStarAura> If you spare her in Me1, that’s it
[1:18:21] <%JoshManVGH> Krogan, more like Krogone
[1:18:23] <%DrTomT18> Exposive, radioactive rounds
[1:18:33] <otakon17> DOWN THE RAMP
[1:18:33] <jackelzxaa> You have to know alot of meta stuff to get the best RENEGADE playthrough with all of the unique scenes they get
[1:18:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Saddest Party on the Citadel
[1:18:37] <Lamokmok> Saddest party on the Citadel
[1:18:37] <Wolfstriker121> yeah you feel like shit in the end
[1:18:40] <%coward_man> make sure to keep the science lady alive to get your favourite line
[1:18:40] <@PlagueOfGripes> must be frustrating to see this bald human walking calmly towards you with infinite shields and a shotgun that you know will cut you in half with one shot
[1:18:40] <DatAsuna> The citadel DLC with only 3 squadmates gets real awkward
[1:18:41] <Wolfstriker121> i know i did
[1:18:42] <+aartbastiaan> Dragon Age Origins is really good with that
[1:18:44] <seniormeatbox> its downstairs ye
[1:18:48] <otakon17> RAMP ON THE RIGHT
[1:18:57] <otakon17> there you go
[1:19:01] <otakon17> yes
[1:19:01] <%DrTomT18> I... dont know
[1:19:02] <PirateMike_> Are we gonna do ME2 today too?
[1:19:02] <seniormeatbox> north
[1:19:02] <%SABiscotti> I don't think so
[1:19:04] <%X2Eliah> ramp, i think
[1:19:07] <%DrTomT18> ?
[1:19:07] <otakon17> you can miss this if you go in the other door
[1:19:08] <%JamesCorck> Yes it does.
[1:19:09] <jackelzxaa> No pat
[1:19:10] <+aartbastiaan> the lower route is way shorter
[1:19:11] <jackelzxaa> Other side
[1:19:11] <Lamokmok> Me neither
[1:19:12] <%X2Eliah> never took that botytom path
[1:19:12] <%JoshManVGH> "What? A player wouldn't do that. Heh... right?"
[1:19:12] <seniormeatbox> north pat
[1:19:15] <dd44dostivei> i think south entrance has faster story content
[1:19:15] <+ThomasOfTroy> Side door is for sneaky times
[1:19:16] <Pookiedaexzile> @PlagueOfGripes Yeah it'd probably be cooler if he jumped
[1:19:17] <jackelzxaa> Not that door
[1:19:18] <DatAsuna> @PirateMike_ after E3
[1:19:22] <spongeofmystery> I have never seen this door before
[1:19:23] <T_Sasquatch> Bioware wrote themselves into a hole with me3
[1:19:23] <%JamesCorck> One of the ways you can help Kirrahe and get the Geth out of his way.
[1:19:26] <ChungusQuest> Kro-Gone everything repellant uses an all-natural, violence-based formula
[1:19:27] <Wolfstriker121> agreed on that comment
[1:19:28] <jackelzxaa> Other door lets you help kirahe
[1:19:34] <+aartbastiaan> the upper route takes the alarms off though
[1:19:35] <seniormeatbox> nobody has lol
[1:19:36] <Wolfstriker121> this is a first for me seeing this
[1:19:37] <%DrTomT18> me either
[1:19:37] <PirateMike_> @DatAsuna When is e3?
[1:19:38] <Ipsenscastle> wow this is new to me
[1:19:40] <Sapphire_Breeze> taris sewers with rakghouls
[1:19:40] <peachy996> I don't rmember this
[1:19:40] <%JamesCorck> Yes it does.
[1:19:40] <jackelzxaa> Because you can call geth towards your position instead of his
[1:19:42] <%Deano8817> LUL
[1:19:42] <otakon17> basically you wouldn't "backtrack" if you take the North door
[1:19:43] <%SABiscotti> OH
[1:19:45] <otakon17> NO
[1:19:45] <Minorou> wtf is that path
[1:19:48] <%Garthunox> you can just loop around to the other route
[1:19:53] <%SABiscotti> If it skips that then LMAO
[1:19:54] <otakon17> THE OTHER DOOR DOES NOT LET YOU HELP KIRRAHE
[1:19:58] <%JoshManVGH> @chungusquest Oh no! Genophage got picked up for a brand deal!
[1:20:01] <%Garthunox> BOTH DOORS DO
[1:20:02] <otakon17> you literally just run past a section
[1:20:03] <%X2Eliah> Oh right, yeah. If you take that bottom path you don't get to draw enemy attention to yourself
[1:20:04] <seniormeatbox> NO THATS A LIE
[1:20:07] <SaltyAzteca> OH NO!
[1:20:07] <seniormeatbox> THIS DOOR LETSD YOU HELP HIM
[1:20:07] <%scaryboisupreme> STOP FUCKING WITH HIM IT DOES

[1:20:15] <%justnathan18> JUST DONT GO IN EITHER DOOR
[1:20:16] <Iwashi94> I have no idea what's going on
[1:20:16] <RedPlasticCup> ONE GUYU
[1:20:16] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[1:20:17] <+aartbastiaan> THE NORTH DOOR HELPS KIRRAHE

[1:20:18] <peachy996> You did Refueling Station
[1:20:18] <Lamokmok> I'm confused guys, wtf?
[1:20:21] <otakon17> it's the ALARM
[1:20:21] <%ScottishMadJacko> One guy
[1:20:21] <T_Sasquatch> ONE GUYYYY
[1:20:21] <Zalapski> goddammit chat!!!
[1:20:22] <%Jumpie8> one guy'd
[1:20:22] <%SABiscotti> THIS door helps, low route does not
[1:20:23] <%Agami23> one of the doors lets you save asuka from the mass produced evas
[1:20:23] <%scaryboisupreme> Pat just do this door

[1:20:32] <%MugenSandan> psaBig psa1guy psa2guy psa3guy
[1:20:35] <dd44dostivei> you can backtrack, either way
[1:20:40] <otakon17> if you take the Northern door you skip an ENTIRE section
[1:20:40] <+Deebo305> ALL DOORS ARE LIES MindManners
[1:20:43] <jackelzxaa> Is it both sides?
[1:20:45] <%DrTomT18> Tali has access. To my DICK.
[1:20:49] <+aartbastiaan> @PatStaresAt Do this then take the south door, 200iq
[1:20:50] <%zyberion626> @patstaresat don't execute the salarian in the cell in the next section, or else your framerates is going to implode
[1:20:53] <peachy996> This is what helps Kirrahe
[1:20:56] <%Maids4lyfe> why does Tali look like she works at Target?
[1:20:56] <+Shubreaker> these fucking trojan ads I swear
[1:20:56] <otakon17> BOTH doors lead to an Alarm station
[1:20:58] <SaltyAzteca> Thanks Tali
[1:21:00] <jackelzxaa> This is the kirahe help
[1:21:06] <otakon17> but the NORTH door skips an ENTIRE section of the base
[1:21:08] <%LumberjackJack> Kirrahe saved?
[1:21:11] <%Nuclearcherries> Pat glows ominously
[1:21:17] <dd44dostivei> south door leads to salarian prisoners
[1:21:17] <AluxStreams> jesus
[1:21:19] <BlackStarAura> Kirrahe is so badass

[1:21:21] <+aartbastiaan> @otakon17 you mean the south door
[1:21:24] <otakon17> ROCKETS ignore Barriers
[1:21:24] <mrtRoll001> He took down a Juggernaut in two shots
[1:21:27] <DSD24> No you gotta destroy the Air Support to keep Kirrahe alive
[1:21:29] <%DrTomT18> Geth sensor error: Humans should not be able to tank a rocket
[1:21:31] <+vaderxyz1970> Pat is too OP

[1:21:52] <peachy996> @DSD24 Did he?
[1:21:53] <SpaceGuntank> man Soldier is so strong, i dont even do that much with my Vanguard
[1:21:54] <spongeofmystery> POWER GAMING
[1:21:56] <%SABiscotti> High-Explosive Space Shotgun
[1:21:56] <%X2Eliah> @vaderxyz1970 legendary edition
[1:21:58] <peachy996> Good.
[1:22:00] <otakon17> they rebalanced the game
[1:22:03] <DSD24> @DrTomT18 Oh ok good
[1:22:03] <Wolfstriker121> pat is glowing as if he is ultra instinct pat
[1:22:04] <seniormeatbox> The game does not expect you to have tone all of the sidequests
[1:22:05] <dd44dostivei> DON'T TAKE THE ELEVATOR RIGHT AWAY
[1:22:08] <otakon17> Legendary is definitely easier
[1:22:11] <+aartbastiaan> what difficulty is it?
[1:22:23] <otakon17> Normal
[1:22:24] <SaltyAzteca> Normal difficulty
[1:22:24] <sajuk_khar> Wait... now it hit me. Why don't geth have biotics?
[1:22:28] <SpaceGuntank> oh, my mistake. i saw the rifle on your back
[1:22:28] <Ipsenscastle> barrier is OP is all
[1:22:29] <mrtRoll001> Normal
[1:22:30] <%X2Eliah> normaldiff
[1:22:33] <otakon17> I'm playing on Veteran and have died in combat ONCE
[1:22:36] <SpaceGuntank> and assumed poorly
[1:22:38] <+aartbastiaan> ME1 is a lot easier than ME2 imo
[1:22:40] <jackelzxaa> Pats on normal
[1:22:40] <%X2Eliah> but Pat is like almosr max level
[1:22:41] <seniormeatbox> @sajuk_khar They're not biological
[1:22:43] <+evbites> @sajuk_khar because they have tech
[1:22:43] <otakon17> @sajuk_khar no nervous system
[1:22:45] <%ingman112> @sajuk_khar They don’t have organic brains
[1:22:46] <peachy996> Kirrahe and the STG are your sole Salaran support in ME3
[1:22:47] <DSD24> Don't you need to be organic to be a biotic?
[1:22:47] <%Nuclearcherries> @sajuk_khar only organics can use em
[1:22:47] <%JamesCorck> They don't have a limbic system, right?
[1:22:54] <%DrTomT18> saving this guy seems to have no bounus
[1:22:55] <DeepPix3l> Most people rush through it and don’t gain XP. So they go into  Virmire at like level 25
[1:22:56] <%zyberion626> keep going
[1:22:56] <DatAsuna> oh those guys
[1:22:57] <%DrTomT18> that I know of
[1:23:01] <%valriot> WTF there was a Killzone collection leak? LUL
[1:23:01] <%zyberion626> stairs on the right
[1:23:02] <%X2Eliah> Hook a right
[1:23:04] <sajuk_khar> But element zero... electricity...
[1:23:09] <otakon17> @sajuk_khar biotics depends on Eezo being manipulated by the nervous system
[1:23:15] <jackelzxaa> Salarian friends
[1:23:18] <%Nuclearcherries> @valriot is it coming to PC?
[1:23:18] <+evbites> @valriot aw sick
[1:23:19] <%king_wragles> I like that people forget that bio means biolgical
[1:23:27] <%X2Eliah> Other strais pat
[1:23:27] <$apolitenoob> Pat, you missed a box
[1:23:27] <TourettesPlays> head up Pat theres a bug where the FPS drops to 10 when you interact with the indoctrinated Salarians
[1:23:28] <seniormeatbox> pat go back
[1:23:29] <%zyberion626> wrong way for the cells
[1:23:32] <%AncelDeLambert> you don't need to be organic to be a biotic, but the Geth likely determined that the energy expenditures of Biotic tactics wasn't worth the resources
[1:23:32] <RyuuAoi> Pat, I'm tipsy but I'm going to get Thai and booze so please stream long time
[1:23:33] <$apolitenoob> It was a hard encyption
[1:23:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> The Salarian commander says "Bunker up" like 5 or 6 times in this mission
[1:23:36] <otakon17> @sajuk_khar they can simulate it with Armatures due to larger Eezo energy cores in the weapons platform
[1:23:36] <%Nuclearcherries> Honestly playing Killzone 2 again would be rad
[1:23:36] <seniormeatbox> you missed the other stairs
[1:23:37] <+aartbastiaan> this leads to the outside door you took before btw
[1:23:39] <%Garthunox> go back a bit
[1:23:39] <%NateyBeak> missed box next to locker?
[1:23:43] <ChungusQuest> Biotics is tech, but with juice.
[1:23:45] <dd44dostivei> big time bug incoming
[1:23:45] <%AncelDeLambert> Geth likely determined that conventional ballistic weaponry was superior
[1:23:48] <%DrTomT18> wrong guy
[1:23:50] <%X2Eliah> He will, it's ok
[1:23:51] <+aartbastiaan> Kappa

[1:31:21] <seniormeatbox> GOOD OLD MEMORY LEAK
[1:31:24] <Pookiedaexzile> You can still feel it
[1:31:24] <dd44dostivei> it goes away after a while
[1:31:25] <+vaderxyz1970> The game was freaked out by your war crimes
[1:31:28] <+even_the_yuenglings> do it again
[1:31:29] <%coward_man> it had to forget about their deaths
[1:31:31] <LluthyY> It goes away when you reach a point further in
[1:31:31] <otakon17> it's got to be some kind of scripting thing with the headshots for the cutscene
[1:31:31] <peachy996> They'll die anyway
[1:31:33] <BrOOnoh> it happens when you kille tjose guys
[1:31:34] <%ThirdWelles> What a shitshow
[1:31:35] <Basch71> that never happens on ps4 when I opened it
[1:31:35] <RyuuAoi> They fixed it...
[1:31:36] <chimeraxmachina> Jfc twitch is so broken, couldn’t play any streams for 10 minutes but ads were playing perfectly fine...this happens all the time
[1:31:37] <Mattais88> Do it again! see if its replaceable
[1:31:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> no
[1:31:41] <+MelodyMedley> Game doesn't like that
[1:31:48] <ChungusQuest> yeah feral Salarians
[1:31:53] <%ThirdWelles> @Mattais88 Replicable
[1:31:54] <+Gamingand808s> thick tali
[1:31:57] <@PlagueOfGripes> Option 4: PUT MORE IN
[1:32:00] <jackelzxaa> 2008 game
[1:32:01] <%ThirdWelles> And it is. because everyone knows about it
[1:32:02] <seniormeatbox> salamamders
[1:32:03] <%coward_man> I love Tali's red and white outfit
[1:32:05] <AluxStreams> Why is Tali mean and Wrex is sympathetic?
[1:32:10] <peachy996> Nothing scarier than a mindless Salarian with no weapon
[1:32:12] <+even_the_yuenglings> too bad we never see any reaperified salarians in me3
[1:32:14] <%Mekhet09> These choices are awful.
[1:32:17] <dd44dostivei> i think dead salarians in general drop framerate
[1:32:17] <%Mekhet09> I mean they're fucked.
[1:32:22] <%Mr_Pylon> I love this team of not doctors goin"it's permanent they should just die"
[1:32:24] <ChungusQuest> Do you think the feral Salarians will establish a stable breeding population?
[1:32:24] <+aartbastiaan> @AluxStreams Wrex wanted to execute them
[1:32:24] <Sunstalker> Option 5: Lock Ashley int here with them
[1:32:26] <RyuuAoi> Always, Plague. AlwYs KappaPride
[1:32:29] <%AllenDeadman> huh
[1:32:33] <+ScottishMadJacko> Krogan doctor
[1:32:34] <Pookiedaexzile> Salarians need a taste of their own medicine
[1:32:35] <Lamokmok> Ashley sad now with less murder
[1:32:38] <%NateyBeak> omg its those things that 3d scan you to turn you into a marketable plushie
[1:32:48] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I kept going with the lag and it eventually fixed itself
[1:32:51] <+aartbastiaan> Krogan scientist LUL
[1:32:55] <+evbites> @even_the_yuenglings i guess the reapers found them useless they only live to 30 anyways
[1:32:55] <otakon17> BEHOLD
[1:32:58] <Mattais88> @ThirdWelles Yeah, I hit the wrong option on the spellcheck
[1:33:00] <jackelzxaa> Ashley shoots them all anyways and says “cant give them salarian bastards a chance, kill them all!”
[1:33:02] <otakon17> a KROGAN SCIENTIST
[1:33:02] <dd44dostivei> poor krogan scientist...

[1:33:20] <+D00msDayDan> there's no way to talk to that guy?
[1:33:21] <peachy996> But with a different mindset
[1:33:21] <+even_the_yuenglings> dont worry we'll save the krogan later
[1:33:22] <%Garthunox> "Have you ever seen a krogan scientist?"
[1:33:22] <+vaderxyz1970> Wrex just let it happen
[1:33:23] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt who gets bullied harder: Krogan or Klingon scientists?
[1:33:26] <otakon17> Dr. Droyas was trying to save his species
[1:33:27] <%Rumbutt> I love how that's a call back to "You ever meet any krogan scientists?" in your first convo with Wrex
[1:33:28] <Sunstalker> Hey man, a krogan scientiest made Grunt. PEAK PERFORMANCE

[1:33:52] <spongeofmystery> Have a soft spot for Snowblind rounds as they let you hold the trigger down on assault rifles forever without overheating
[1:33:55] <%JamesCorck> Yeah, you're going to finish this within the hour.
[1:33:55] <jackelzxaa> I wonder if you’ll mert a krogan genophage researcher scientist in another game, like maybe a second game?
[1:33:58] <Ipsenscastle> yup. two hours, tops
[1:34:05] <dd44dostivei> i was thinking krogan scientists were a ME2 retcon, but i was wrong
[1:34:10] <peachy996> Reload the stream X2eliah

[1:39:12] <ChungusQuest> well, first comes the inspiration for Star Trek: PicaRD
[1:39:13] <+alphonseisbest> its the best for the reapers but not the series overall
[1:39:13] <Pookiedaexzile> THIS IS ANTI 3

[1:42:27] <snakemuho> ME3 changed my perception of Sovereign from a lovecraftian AI to a teen edgelord
[1:42:27] <%AzureGale> I'm 14 and this is deep
[1:42:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Kinda Puts teh Geth into Context, REcontextualizes the whole Geth vs Qurian thing

[1:42:32] <ChungusQuest> OUR TECHNOLOGY
[1:42:35] <%Blackleafx> @sajuk_khar As far as I know it is? Isn't Sovereign just what Saren calls him?

[1:42:52] <peachy996> "You exists because we allow it and you will end because we demand it" is also a fantastic line
[1:42:56] <+aartbastiaan> YOU EXIST BECAUSE WE ALLOW IT

[1:43:24] <+Photonicfab> What do you they get from letting organic life evolve
[1:43:25] <%justnathan18> I love how Wrex is just fucking quiet while Tali has soooo much to say
[1:43:26] <+EmptyMug> "It's just fun dude"
[1:43:28] <sajuk_khar> @Blackleafx but I guess Saren got the name from the ship?
[1:43:29] <+GuilKato> space cuttlefish has no chill
[1:43:30] <jorniev> is the main thread in me5 gonna be organic?
[1:43:30] <AthenaAegis> GYGAS WutFace
[1:43:31] <%AncelDeLambert> just admit you're the Borg and fuck off
[1:43:31] <+wizard_of_diamonds> They changed his voice!
[1:43:33] <snakemuho> to be fair, you need very high IQ to grasp the nature of Reapers
[1:43:35] <commander_ninja> They need you to reproduce. Reaper sex requires genocide
[1:43:35] <+aartbastiaan> ME3 destroyed that
[1:43:36] <ChungusQuest> ELDRITCH LIBERTARIAN SPACE CYBER CUTTLEFISH
[1:43:36] <+evbites> god they are up thiere own asses so hard

[1:43:42] <%MrMegaJackpots> damn this game REALLY is just babylon 5
[1:43:43] <+Deebo305> They want our e-girls TableHere

[1:44:05] <%AzureGale> No, Legion is a Geth
[1:44:06] <+evbites> thousands millions
[1:44:06] <nuane> I live how he didnt answer a single question
[1:44:08] <%TrafficCohen> Man, ME3 fucked so much canon
[1:44:09] <+EySoyCoco> LEGIT THE BEST SCENE IN THE SAGA
[1:44:09] <+Gamingand808s> LOVECRAFTIAN ELDER BOTS
[1:44:10] <+MelodyMedley> Yeah...
[1:44:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Fuck Mass Effect 3
[1:44:11] <%AllenDeadman> no Legion is a character we meet later Kappa
[1:44:11] <+Pequod1> pretty dramatic for a computer
[1:44:12] <peachy996> Yeah that's a big lore fuckup in Leviathan and why ppl don't speak too highly of that DLC
[1:44:16] <jorniev> THE SQUID didn't answer the why are they doing this
[1:44:18] <+Photonicfab> YOU CANT FIGHT AGAINST MY NUMBA CHOOSING POWA
[1:44:19] <iosephe> Fucking MACHINES
[1:44:19] <+GuilKato> what the hell shepard you like ais
[1:44:23] <sajuk_khar> Ah yes... Infinite reapers from beyond the edge of the galaxy
[1:44:24] <%valriot> Its a "lie" but they still existed for thousands of cycles
[1:44:24] <%AncelDeLambert> organics are machines, Shepard, you dumb shit
[1:44:27] <intylerwe_trust> They really have to nerf the reapers for the rest of the games to happen.. man
[1:44:28] <jackelzxaa> People speak highly of leviathan
[1:44:30] <Wolfstriker121> 10/10
[1:44:34] <%justnathan18> Sovereign has blocked Shepard
[1:44:35] <AluxStreams> They actually made an evil robot sound more cool than a Dalek.
[1:44:36] <+aartbastiaan> Even Wrex just shat his pants
[1:44:37] <RyuuAoi> Playin those Devil games, Pat?!
[1:44:39] <jackelzxaa> Its just that they only did what they could with what me3 left them
[1:44:40] <Essixian> DO WE, JOKER
[1:44:41] <Ipsenscastle> that might be one of my favourite scenes from anything
[1:44:45] <JetpackMcQuack> Leviathan is a narrative patch job
[1:44:47] <+teelor32> "fuck you, im better, we're done talking inferior"
[1:44:47] <RyuuAoi> The Demon in the machine.
[1:44:48] <RedPlasticCup> !uptime
[1:44:49] <@Moobot> @RedPlasticCup I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 45m.
[1:44:49] <%scaryboisupreme> It's coming SO hard
[1:44:49] <PlasmaDood> ok so who remembers his real name?
[1:44:50] <spongeofmystery> The chat with Vigil is only slightly less cool than this
[1:44:52] <ScreamLord> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:44:52] <%Blackleafx> CUMMIN HARD
[1:44:53] <dd44dostivei> it's okay joker, you'll kill it like tomorrow
[1:44:54] <HaroldDonchee> the fact that he even takes the time to talk to shepherd shows they're not that different
[1:44:54] <Garry_Guyface> It's cumming hard
[1:44:54] <%AzureGale> Seriously, people nut over this?
[1:44:56] <%SirGO0SE> coming hard Kreygasm
[1:44:57] <$Ziegsy> Coming hard? ziegsyEyes
[1:44:57] <+evbites> @AluxStreams thats  low bar
[1:45:02] <Big_Dream> We killing the racist
[1:45:03] <%justnathan18> LETS GO SET THE NUKE
[1:45:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh and it can move towardss you small person
[1:45:04] <AluxStreams> "Let's head to Pound Town."
[1:45:05] <+liquidzr0> adumBooty
[1:45:05] <awalbaru> Pick me up Joker
[1:45:05] <SaltyAzteca> Kreygasm
[1:45:08] <Minorou> "Let's head to the breeding facility, Tali"
[1:45:08] <peachy996> @PlasmaDood Nazara
[1:45:08] <%ScottishMadJacko> Isnt sovereigns name nevara?
[1:45:08] <knotsundownsyndrome> @PlasmaDood navarra
[1:45:10] <jorniev> when asked why was fucking over the universe it said we are awesome and you smell
[1:45:10] <+GuilKato> sheer any of our ships in half..... with mass effect that would negate that effect?
[1:45:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Barrier that shit
[1:45:11] <Big_Dream> kill ashely
[1:45:13] <Ipsenscastle> new people, how blown are your minds on a scale of 1 to 10?
[1:45:13] <%AllenDeadman> god ME3 fucking sucked...
[1:45:13] <%scaryboisupreme> Sovereign is basically Vergil as a ship
[1:45:14] <viewtifulr> Ghost in Mecha-Godzilla
[1:45:16] <+Pequod1> Vigil is top cause of the music that plays
[1:45:16] <%NateyBeak> so waht DO the reapers get out of civilizations by letting them grow?
[1:45:17] <WSintai> psaSmug_FB
[1:45:18] <+MelodyMedley> Kreygasm
[1:45:18] <Coystick> I need a cigarette
[1:45:19] <wolverinewaswrong> Wonder what happened to that realm of existence he mentioned?
[1:45:19] <%X2Eliah> So yeah ME1 had this, and ME2 had a fucking Terminator
[1:45:20] <+natedrago> yeah that would have crazy without prior knowledge
[1:45:22] <iosephe> it could have been great
[1:45:22] <%templar010> but they werent
[1:45:24] <Pookiedaexzile> IT WAS SO COOL
[1:45:25] <Lamokmok> Sovereign-senpai noticed you
[1:45:26] <zanzibarian_hamster> So you called him up, he said you aren't who we wanted and we ARE going to kill you, and he hung up, awesome
[1:45:27] <%templar010> Said the Narrator
[1:45:29] <SaphronBlackbourne> ME3 rules actually
[1:45:30] <$LightningLynx89> Yeah Sovereign are just big dumb robot squid
[1:45:31] <+athuramn> ARE there any new people?
[1:45:34] <%Retinolgaming> Virgin Harbinger vs Chad Sovereign LUL
[1:45:34] <RyuuAoi> THIS is the last Conjuring.
[1:45:35] <Blank9> they couldn't really be anything, that dialogue said a lot about the reapers
[1:45:35] <%coward_man> crazy thought but could it be explained away that the reason in 3 Reapers can get bodied easily is cause they got new weapon tech from Sovereign?
[1:45:37] <%JoshManVGH> All Reapers lose their child and yearn for a surrogate.
[1:45:38] <+FoolsArcade> @Ipsenscastle not new to the series, but I dont see this as a high point lol
[1:45:38] <+Ropcord> 3 bad BabyRage
[1:45:41] <+vaderxyz1970> @NateyBeak Resources I guess?
[1:45:42] <%justnathan18> Fun fact! ME2's boss was supposed to be a giant geth baby
[1:45:46] <$apolitenoob> It's been so long, how did this ruin 3? I genuinely can't remember
[1:45:46] <Pookiedaexzile> You ask him about his origin and he shits on you by saying you have no future
[1:45:46] <+Tucker0603> I still like 3
[1:45:46] <stantheman_97> alright now to never live up to the hype
[1:45:53] <%Maids4lyfe> @NateyBeak they harvest organic life to make their brain cores, reapers are cyborgs made from billions of lives melted into goo
[1:45:57] <ammobasket> Calling them reapers was shockingly on the nose!
[1:46:05] <%scaryboisupreme> Reapers were so cool then ME3 just says "no they're dumb robots made by big squids but actually they were made by themselves? I think?"
[1:46:05] <+aartbastiaan> the Reapers are still 20x more advanced technologically than the galaxy after ME3
[1:46:06] <%X2Eliah> @apolitenoob Idk
[1:46:06] <Garry_Guyface> Remember how there was a Human-Reaper in the shape of a Human, but every other reaper is Big Sovereign
[1:46:08] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Geth Destroyer? More like Get Destroyed amirite?
[1:46:08] <jorniev> is this virmire?
[1:46:09] <nukle0nik> their head is in their chest
[1:46:09] <%ArthurDayne88> They're weak spot is guns
[1:46:14] <+GuilKato> Wrex take a blood sample from the clone solder krogan!
[1:46:14] <+Tucker0603> I miss the multiplayer the most T^T
[1:46:17] <%machshop> yeah well the rachni didn't have GUNS
[1:46:20] <+GuilKato> to learn how to un genophage
[1:46:22] <RyuuAoi> Pat on easy?
[1:46:22] <nukle0nik> why does the music sound so weird
[1:46:22] <+GuilKato> quickly
[1:46:22] <+D00msDayDan> they're also impossible to headshot from behind
[1:46:24] <intylerwe_trust> Boy all the people saying “ehh not impressed” are some lame
[1:46:26] <SaltyAzteca> this is it
[1:46:27] <%NateyBeak> @Maids4lyfe ty i played the games and like, SUPER forgot why
[1:46:28] <Ashrox117> That shotgun damage wow
[1:46:31] <%Blackleafx> @Garry_Guyface The concept art explains how it would look if it was finished
[1:46:34] <Sunstalker> Man, the Reapers are even less impressed by us then Quark is by Nog. kinamaFeelsbad
[1:46:35] <roboyuji> It just seems like a typical evil robot speech
[1:46:36] <Pookiedaexzile> They had teh ability to have different make ups as well
[1:46:41] <Profmcstevie> Damn I've missed a BIT, when did gameplay start usedBeef
[1:46:44] <bigshedman> @Garry_Guyface There is concept art about how the human reaper would kind of merge into the more general Reaper design if it was finished.
[1:46:45] <RyuuAoi> @ashrox117 For real tho
[1:46:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Like a Different type of Reaper for different types of life
[1:46:53] <+evbites> @apolitenoob they are not the boss just a tool to record data
[1:46:56] <%justnathan18> Its only fitting for Ashley to die. SHe was living on borrowed time since Eden Prime
[1:47:00] <JetpackMcQuack> shit he just walked right through
[1:47:02] <+aartbastiaan> I study AI and can't wait to make my first reaper
[1:47:14] <jorniev> reapers love to gloat
[1:47:16] <jackelzxaa> Remember when bioware CUT the outcome to save both kaiden and ashley, despite recording post mission dialog where both of the react
[1:47:17] <+evbites> @aartbastiaan please no
[1:47:19] <ScreamLord> Barrier if fucking busted
[1:47:19] <RyuuAoi> Fuck it. Mask off.
[1:47:22] <Sp3ctre48> ME3 messes it up in retrospect because the super mysterious reason that we could not even begin to understand ended up being really silly
[1:47:26] <dd44dostivei> in all fairness, meeting god's god would just be another lame god
[1:47:28] <+vaderxyz1970> You know for all its atempted realism why dont they fire a rock really fast from orbit?
[1:47:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Now its just big robot, but it could have been so much grander
[1:47:32] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[1:47:33] <commander_ninja> I also study AI and we're not even close to reapers
[1:47:35] <+trackles_64> they didnt ehy just made it suck
[1:47:36] <peachy996> It's still there
[1:47:38] <%AllenDeadman> too strong I guess?
[1:47:39] <%valriot> They put it back in 3 LUL
[1:47:39] <%LumberjackJack> Barrier's in all 3, just not as broken
[1:47:40] <%Maids4lyfe> gee I wonder
[1:47:41] <%jillpilled> real mystery there nyannHmm
[1:47:41] <Ashrox117> LOL
[1:47:42] <%Blackleafx> @aartbastiaan Did you see the news article a few days ago that "The first AI has killed a human with no instruction"
[1:47:42] <bellmorgu> its in 2
[1:47:42] <+coldsama> they didin't??
[1:47:43] <$LightningLynx89> I mean Sovereign's speech isn't anything new for sci-fi. There have been many sci-fi stories that have had that same big evil robot ai speech.
[1:47:43] <%ScottishMadJacko> Its a bonus power in me2
[1:47:44] <+Deebo305> Barrier is in ME2
[1:47:44] <+aartbastiaan> @commander_ninja FeelsBadMan
[1:47:44] <%justnathan18> @jackelzxaa One of them dying is way better thoguh
[1:47:45] <otakon17> it's still there
[1:47:46] <%templar010> Literally the only thing Jake is good for
[1:47:46] <+rich_mon> reapers are just space kaiju
[1:47:47] <peachy996> It's a power you unlock after Jacob
[1:47:47] <+evbites> @jackelzxaa i thought that was meant as a joke
[1:47:50] <+Tucker0603> @patstaresat it's still in mass effect 2 just reworked
[1:47:50] <otakon17> Barrier is just weaker in ME2
[1:47:51] <commander_ninja> We can barely program an AI that identifies dogs in pictures
[1:47:52] <$apolitenoob> @evbites Oh that's incredibly lame. Thanks man
[1:47:52] <+Shockrates20XX> Because Sentinel needed something.
[1:47:53] <+YabbaTroll> @commander_ninja thats what they want you to think
[1:47:54] <mrtRoll001> Barrier is God Mode
[1:47:59] <%ScottishMadJacko> You get it from jacob i think
[1:48:01] <SpaceGuntank> its Nerfed in 2 but yes its still there
[1:48:02] <%cvp5127> does pat use is grenades?
[1:48:06] <otakon17> Barrier is a power Jacob gives you
[1:48:09] <%scaryboisupreme> I'll say it again, things in games like Reapers, or The Flood, or The Forerunners, they DON'T need an origin story
[1:48:10] <jackelzxaa> Mass Effect 2 has barrier as a loyalty power but its not as good
[1:48:16] <otakon17> I haven't used grenades AT ALL
[1:48:16] <%LumberjackJack> You learn barrier after doing Jacob's loyalty and getting advanced training
[1:48:19] <jorniev> this is virmire right?
[1:48:23] <%Maids4lyfe> you have to use Jacob to get it
[1:48:25] <%ScottishMadJacko> Yup
[1:48:25] <%X2Eliah> Someone mentione Jacob? maaaaan... fk jacob
[1:48:25] <jackelzxaa> Sentinel class in 2 is where they put the barrier power
[1:48:26] <+aartbastiaan> @Blackleafx no but there have been AI-guided robots that won competitions by literally breaking their opponents without any instruction
[1:48:28] <aiutare47> The indoctrination aspect as well as the dreaming god stuff is super sick
[1:48:29] <Pookiedaexzile> @rich_mon But they could have been DIVERSE kaju
[1:48:29] <%JamesCorck> Nnn...
[1:48:29] <wolverinewaswrong> Yes
[1:48:30] <%JumboCrunchies> Pretty much
[1:48:30] <%machshop> kinda
[1:48:30] <ScreamLord> Pretty much
[1:48:31] <spongeofmystery> That's correct
[1:48:31] <Basch71> yes
[1:48:31] <+D_day> Reave + Biotic charge FeelsGoodMan
[1:48:32] <signofzeta> yup
[1:48:32] <+ThomasOfTroy> Yeah, that's about right
[1:48:32] <%JamesCorck> Noooo?
[1:48:32] <+Frosty_YaYa> pretty much
[1:48:33] <dd44dostivei> and vigil
[1:48:33] <wolverinewaswrong> I think
[1:48:34] <+evbites> @aartbastiaan FUCK
[1:48:34] <Wolfstriker121> yup
[1:48:34] <+alphonseisbest> yea
[1:48:35] <+Tucker0603> @patstaresat it works like tech armor for sentinel in 2 but has a duration instead of being there until your shields break
[1:48:35] <Alzero83> Pretty much
[1:48:36] <nukle0nik> ey-los, not ee-los
[1:48:36] <%AllenDeadman> mhm
[1:48:37] <aiutare47> Iilos is short, thats all I remember'
[1:48:37] <%ScottishMadJacko> Its pretty short
[1:48:38] <joec182> its really short
[1:48:39] <RedPlasticCup> Yup
[1:48:39] <%LumberjackJack> Ilos? Pretty much
[1:48:39] <%jillpilled> Yeah
[1:48:42] <+idyota> yep
[1:48:42] <%SABiscotti> It's shorter than Virmire
[1:48:42] <aiutare47> and talking
[1:48:42] <%JamesCorck> Ilos is like four battle rooms, and the Mako run.
[1:48:45] <%castlerock42> There's some extra Mako stuff, but yeah.
[1:48:45] <DatAsuna> Reapers have the Ada Wong problem, in that they have a big mystery but the writers don't even know what the mystery is.
[1:48:45] <%Pappajimbo> Froma me2 I thought the idea was repears let races progress and harvest the best tobecome new reapers and destroy the rest. but boy was I wrong lol
[1:48:46] <%X2Eliah> Ilos is... 2 rooms and 1 corridor
[1:48:46] <jackelzxaa> Tech armor in 2 and 3 is busted
[1:48:47] <pmaratsuper> Yes. But big combat rooms.
[1:48:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Yeah, wanna start 2
[1:48:49] <PirateMike_> Time to kill ashley!
[1:48:49] <Sp3ctre48> I thought it was longer than that but I guess?
[1:48:49] <%jtdobyns> ive noticed the main character when using barrier there eyes turn black. is that an eso
[1:48:52] <peachy996> The majority of Ilos is in the talking
[1:48:52] <aiutare47> You also talk to the VI thing
[1:48:53] <Ashrox117> I’m just sad I can’t be jedi volus with orbs in ME:3 multiplayer in the new version
[1:48:54] <+ThomasOfTroy> You could beat this within like 2-3 hours
[1:48:54] <awalbaru> Beat me first papa
[1:48:57] <Wolfstriker121> inc flyby
[1:48:59] <%machshop> the citadel gauntlet is a slog though
[1:49:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Yeah wanna start ME2
[1:49:00] <Alzero83> This game isnt actually as long as people remember, its longer cause of the original load times @PatStaresAt
[1:49:02] <%justnathan18> The moment weve all been waiting for
[1:49:04] <+GuilKato> i played me1 through so many times without ever actually going to the cargo bay and finding kirahe
[1:49:05] <%AllenDeadman> it's time
[1:49:06] <+evbites> @evbites it's still cool just minor downgrade
[1:49:10] <+Pequod1> Big cool comin up
[1:49:16] <Wolfstriker121> CHAT!!!   its time!!
[1:49:17] <saddy66> I’m right on time
[1:49:17] <+vaderxyz1970> OH THATS SO COOL
[1:49:18] <commander_ninja> Kaiden is boring. Kill him. Y'all hate Ashley but at least she brings about some emotion in you
[1:49:19] <Pookiedaexzile> @Ashrox117 Theres a Vollus like that in 2
[1:49:20] <jackelzxaa> Illos is the first set of areas, mako, vigil, and then the run
[1:49:25] <ScreamLord> That nuke ends up being WAY bigger than 20-Kilotons. You can see it from orbit and the explosion would wipe out a small country
[1:49:26] <peachy996> Well when you do the Sidequests this game is pretty lengthy
[1:49:28] <Sunstalker> are Reapers just Thanos but more tentacles and less magic stones
[1:49:30] <jackelzxaa> The first area of illos is a multifloor complex
[1:49:31] <aiutare47> If Pat played ME3MP he would 100% be the Orb Lord Volus
[1:49:33] <wolverinewaswrong> Nukes look weird in the future
[1:49:33] <%X2Eliah> @commander_ninja That's a bad take.
[1:49:33] <commander_ninja> Keep Ashley to keep hating Ashley
[1:49:37] <spongeofmystery> The goblin glider!
[1:49:37] <awalbaru> monkaS
[1:49:38] <Alzero83> Let them both die.....
[1:49:38] <%justnathan18> @commander_ninja Its too late. Kirahe is with Kaiden
[1:49:40] <%castlerock42> The only time the rest of the crew bothers to help in the whole game.
[1:49:42] <jorniev> water
[1:49:43] <%scaryboisupreme> This nuke wipes out like half a continent
[1:49:43] <peachy996> But main missions only the game can be knocked out in a day or two
[1:49:44] <+evbites> @commander_ninja ash sucks kaiden is great
[1:49:47] <nukle0nik> keep ashley because kaidan is boring
[1:49:48] <%Nuclearcherries> @commander_ninja OK racism fan
[1:49:49] <$SGrim> SOON!
[1:49:50] <%MugenSandan> psaBig SOON psaGib
[1:49:51] <peachy996> Bye Ashley
[1:49:51] <Pookiedaexzile> She dies here
[1:49:53] <spongeofmystery> Hang on, not yet
[1:49:56] <SpaceGuntank> here we go..
[1:49:56] <jorniev> SPLISH SLOPSH
[1:50:04] <peachy996> Die with honor Williams
[1:50:05] <HaroldDonchee> I'd love if one of the solarians was like wtf are you doing don't get it wet
[1:50:06] <zanzibarian_hamster> @Sunstalker The reapers use organic life like we use yeast to make bread
[1:50:06] <%justnathan18> Kaiden at least makes sense at being a Spectre
[1:50:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Do it Right Pat,
[1:50:08] <+Ropcord> ashley lives so he can shoot her later
[1:50:09] <+YabbaTroll> why is that the renegade option?
[1:50:12] <DatAsuna> No MAN left behind
[1:50:12] <%machshop> kill Carth
[1:50:14] <vonpimpenstein> it's pretty dumb that she is pink. power ranger looking ass
[1:50:15] <%Ranryu692> for some reason I remembered this decision being near the beginning of the game
[1:50:16] <WSintai> Yeah...meet her "Back"
[1:50:16] <Wolfstriker121> and i hate you ash!!!
[1:50:17] <$LightningLynx89> Ashley is interesting and you can just kill her later on. Kaiden is just boring.
[1:50:18] <Alzero83> let her faukin die
[1:50:18] <DatAsuna> the vvymen tho...
[1:50:19] <+GuilKato> ..... why? why do you need time to arm it
[1:50:20] <AngryAsian5> It's almost time ...
[1:50:24] <last_dragoon92> So Ash or Kaiden?
[1:50:24] <saddy66> Has pat played mass effect before
[1:50:26] <awalbaru> Omg I remeber the phrase
[1:50:26] <%LumberjackJack> Keep the nuke super safe, Ashley
[1:50:28] <%ScottishMadJacko> Yeah, the better party member, nuke
[1:50:29] <peachy996> "Die with Honor, Williams" "What?" "I mean you keep that nuke safe"
[1:50:30] <%cvp5127> no carth left behind
[1:50:31] <Profmcstevie> Better squad, MOVE OUT
[1:50:34] <saddy66> Or is this his first time
[1:50:37] <LluthyY> save our sweet best boi
[1:50:38] <%ScottishMadJacko> Im more sad about losing the nuke than ashley
[1:50:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Gaurd it Ashley
[1:50:39] <%TheotherKristian> The moment we've all been waiting for!!!
[1:50:40] <+red_cuppa> @saddy66 yes
[1:50:40] <%justnathan18> @saddy66 Like a bunch of times
[1:50:43] <DatAsuna> @saddy66 1 and 2
[1:50:44] <stantheman_97> die already
[1:50:44] <+GuilKato> mass effect increases density and you smash two subcritical masses into each other
[1:50:45] <WSintai> @GuilKato She forgot her glasses
[1:50:48] <jackelzxaa> Shepard “i will not let baby kaiden die”
[1:50:49] <aiutare47> "Breeding Trench" is an interesting phrase
[1:50:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Till the last breath
[1:50:50] <heybenice> Best boi
[1:50:53] <%LumberjackJack> This room sucks on Insanity
[1:50:53] <%miguelrod777> later Ashley will totally pick you up later
[1:50:54] <+MightyDuckShoes> wömen.
[1:50:56] <+Pequod1> isn't the nuke like a eezo drive
[1:50:57] <saddy66> Thanks
[1:50:58] <+GuilKato> it seems vry very easy to turn on
[1:50:59] <+evbites> @GuilKato yeah set up a bomb before putting in in it's desired area what a good idea
[1:50:59] <%ingman112> @saddy66 He’s played 1 and 2
[1:51:01] <+Pequod1> it's way more valuable
[1:51:06] <AluxStreams> Ashley if you don't guard that bomb the turians will take it.
[1:51:07] <Sunstalker> Man, I would love if Kirrahe was a party member in a ME reboot. Kick ass Salarian commando? Dope shit
[1:51:11] <%LumberjackJack> LUL He wanted a hug
[1:51:12] <Kain5707> LUL
[1:51:12] <BigDaddyofCincinnati> LUL
[1:51:14] <%NateyBeak> that krogan wanted a smooch
[1:51:15] <peachy996> That Krogan wanted to kiss
[1:51:22] <Lamokmok> Aw he just wanted a huh
[1:51:22] <%AllenDeadman> he came to say hi
[1:51:23] <signofzeta> cuddlebug krogans
[1:51:26] <+evbites> @Sunstalker you get mordin
[1:51:26] <commander_ninja> @AluxStreams lmao
[1:51:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Krogan really went for it
[1:51:32] <%SABiscotti> HERE we go
[1:51:33] <peachy996> But only Wrex gets the smooch
[1:51:33] <BlackStarAura> I hate Ashley in 1, but I’ve kept her alive almost as many times as I’ve killed her
[1:51:34] <%MugenSandan> Ashley just maybe get super close to the bomb to guard it well.  like HUG THE BOMB trust me here
[1:51:35] <+GuilKato> @evbites yes - because with mass effect you can make the fissionable material subcritical by lowering it mass
[1:51:36] <+even_the_yuenglings> YEYEYEY
[1:51:40] <Lamokmok> Cuddles the Krogan
[1:51:43] <jorniev> my favorite part about the mass effect is the power to trow yourself as a projectile
[1:51:44] <AngryAsian5> IT'S TIIIIIIIMEEE
[1:51:47] <sweatch0> is this the epic nuke moment?
[1:51:47] <$apolitenoob> That's the most leisurely jog I've already seen

[1:53:10] <mrtRoll001> You're making Ashley a war hero, Pat
[1:53:10] <%NateyBeak> pat I thought you were gonna play the long game just to obliterate her in 3
[1:53:12] <%MugenSandan> THE ASHLEY HAS BEEN DEFEATED
[1:53:12] <%Nuclearcherries> Now that racism has been defeated, what will Woolie do?
[1:53:12] <mrtRoll001> Is this what you want?
[1:53:13] <karl_rex> Funny thing is Ashley has almost 0 content in 3

[1:53:16] <T_Sasquatch> Omg nooo

[1:53:17] <%chance_h> Like in the Lion King
[1:53:17] <+even_the_yuenglings> kaiden is SUPER canadian in me3
[1:53:20] <%moonmintparadise> Come on Ashley, you were allways in favor of destroying FOREIGN lifeforms, right?
[1:53:20] <Aydarkzero> I like how I joined back at the right time LUL
[1:53:20] <+OmegaWeltall> eh both are horrible so .. whatevs
[1:53:21] <%twistedj3ster> don't the ghosts tell you honor doesnt matter?
[1:53:22] <peachy996> It does actually save her family honor and she isn't remembered as a racist. So basically Ash wins
[1:53:22] <saddy66> I MUST HEAR HIM
[1:53:22] <@PlagueOfGripes> Burnt trash is left no cleaner than before
[1:53:23] <commander_ninja> Man fuck yall, Ashley's fine. Interesting flawed character who's become a meme caricature
[1:53:25] <zanzibarian_hamster> She died how she wanted to, taking a TON of aliens with her
[1:53:25] <ammobasket> Giving her opportunities to succeed
[1:53:26] <jackelzxaa> Pat, realising that kaiden is the only canadian in mass effect “maybe i’ll…not kill this carth.”

[1:56:25] <+YabbaTroll> OOF
[1:56:26] <Pookiedaexzile> Boy Sicked up with that Robo shit
[1:56:27] <Ipsenscastle> it wouldve been so much cooler if he got more robotty throughout the game
[1:56:30] <wolverinewaswrong> *Heretics
[1:56:30] <+vaderxyz1970> wouldn't it be so cool if the Nuke just went off right now
[1:56:34] <+aartbastiaan> Too cool to be worshiped
[1:56:37] <+michingmallecho> I just want to be in a Gundam in my lifetime BibleThump
[1:56:38] <%DianaTheAscian> is he not aware he has robot parts?
[1:56:39] <BlackStarAura> Zero sympathy for this dude
[1:56:41] <+evbites> he is just evil woolie
[1:56:43] <peachy996> That denial could be Indoctrination or being mentally unwell
[1:56:44] <%Blackleafx> @Ipsenscastle I think theres a mod that adds that
[1:56:44] <+xerotwo> ONORE SAREN!!!! doodCrazy
[1:56:48] <JetpackMcQuack> become a tool
[1:56:49] <+GuilKato> but what if the geth built itself a giant reaper body
[1:56:51] <Sunstalker> Do you think he asked Sovereign for a fuck bot?
[1:56:51] <%dekkitout> Sovereign: No groupies
[1:56:52] <ammobasket> So it’s emotional
[1:56:52] <jorniev> SAREN the idea that the ancient genocidal machine is gonna let you live because you have up is emotional and irrational
[1:56:55] <+GuilKato> would the reapers then be cool with it
[1:56:56] <jackelzxaa> His robot parts actually get a minor change after this, i believe these are just supposed to be “generic tech upgrades”
[1:56:57] <Lamokmok> It's Fred Tatasciore? Cool.
[1:56:59] <Ipsenscastle> @Blackleafx sick
[1:56:59] <$Ziegsy> Does his face tentacles wiggle when hes happy? like a dogs tail?
[1:57:00] <%X2Eliah> Saren is 100% Woolie-logic
[1:57:02] <jackelzxaa> But later he is full glowy

[1:57:24] <JetpackMcQuack> no :(
[1:57:24] <%Nekros4442> You're an idiot
[1:57:25] <commander_ninja> @DianaTheAscian He said "My mind is my own... for now." So he's aware he's susceptible to control, he just thinks he's too strong for it. This also makes Saren stupid
[1:57:25] <%machshop> why are humans the only ones with hair
[1:57:26] <seniormeatbox> thats a big lie
[1:57:26] <BlackStarAura> Dumb ass

[1:58:00] <+aartbastiaan> collaborators have done this since forever
[1:58:01] <AngryAsian5> No, I am your father Saren!
[1:58:08] <+GuilKato> the reapers are too powerful - if only we had space magic..... oh wait!
[1:58:08] <jackelzxaa> “Soverign said i could get some sick shit!”
[1:58:09] <LluthyY> big copium
[1:58:09] <commander_ninja> @notsoy LUL
[1:58:11] <spongeofmystery> Sovereign is super on the level
[1:58:12] <+D00msDayDan> HOW CAN THIS BE
[1:58:14] <+tempestzephyr> is he just uncle ruckus?
[1:58:19] <jackelzxaa> This is good
[1:58:20] <+evbites> you were  the chosen one saren
[1:58:21] <+MightyDuckShoes> "Join Me! And together, we can pick the space cotton fields!"    Noooo!
[1:58:25] <+xerotwo> ONORE SAREN!!!! doodCrazy
[1:58:26] <+StoopKid241> Imagine if Saren survived and could join in ME3, like the main antagonist from Baldur's Gate 1 joining the party in the Baldur's Gate 2 expansion.
[1:58:27] <%chance_h> Hey Pat are u going to try to convince Saran to off himself in the final battle?
[1:58:27] <ScreamLord> Cool story bro
[1:58:28] <AngryAsian5> Hmmmmmm
[1:58:29] <%DEETRz> saren picks synthesis ending confirmed
[1:58:30] <wolverinewaswrong> SYNTHESIS HE WANTS SYNTHESIS!
[1:58:32] <Sunstalker> @machshop We're the youngest race, we'd probably lose it all at some point in evolution? Also fuck trying to make alien hair, it'd just look weird and ask a lot of resources
[1:58:33] <+aartbastiaan> HE IS THE GREEN OPTION FROM ME3
[1:58:36] <+Desthanos> The interesting thing about this is that you don't just straight up convince him that he's wrong in this scene with the speech check, but it does influence him in later scenes.
[1:58:36] <%justnathan18> You ARE a machine!
[1:58:36] <%dekkitout> Sarens plan sounds like a lot of work, and I'm too lazy to get onboard with that
[1:58:36] <+xerotwo> ONOREEEEEEEEEEE doodCrazy
[1:58:37] <Pookiedaexzile> You were to Bring Balance to the Splorch not Destory it
[1:58:37] <%SABiscotti> This machine would never lie to me, Shepard!
[1:58:38] <jackelzxaa> This is a good and very believable rationale for a villain who sees himself as being justified
[1:58:39] <aiutare47> YEP
[1:58:40] <peachy996> This guy is the Synthesis Ending
[1:58:45] <%Blackleafx> GREEN
[1:58:45] <+CursedNobleman> @tempestzephyr cant trust those new organics-- over there~
[1:58:46] <commander_ninja> LUL LUL LUL
[1:58:47] <%ScottishMadJacko> oh my god he is
[1:58:47] <+michingmallecho> Saren, your parents sold you for beer money. You're born from nothing.
[1:58:48] <jackelzxaa> He’s wrong but he sells it well
[1:58:49] <%knight1210> YEP
[1:58:53] <+even_the_yuenglings> I love the goblin glider

[1:58:55] <%Blackleafx> LITERALLY WOOLIE
[1:58:55] <%Ranryu692> oh god there was actually precedent for that?
[1:58:56] <thetunnelhomer> Get this Green ending out of my face.
[1:58:56] <Brandon__Brando> red is the best ending
[1:58:59] <RyuuAoi> @patstaresat When's SMT III quick look? Fuck Dante
[1:58:59] <aiutare47> Are you in or are you out?
[1:58:59] <Sunstalker> THE ULTIMATE CENTRIST award is now unlocked
[1:59:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BLUE ALL THE WAY BABY
[1:59:01] <+evbites> And illusive man is control
[1:59:02] <+liquidzr0> synthesis is the best option
[1:59:02] <%miguelrod777> he's green if he wasn't indoctrinated
[1:59:02] <%CalderGaming> ehhhhhhh
[1:59:03] <%Deano8817> Wait, isn't synthesis considered the GOOD ENDING OF 3???
[1:59:03] <+OmegaWeltall> yea the only "Good" option is Destroy
[1:59:04] <+aartbastiaan> Illusive man is the "control" option and Anderson is the "destroy" option
[1:59:04] <Aydarkzero> this is just a Crash bandicoot boss fight
[1:59:05] <%X2Eliah> So Saren = Synthesis, Illusive Man = Control, who i Destroy?
[1:59:07] <+Deebo305> Saren is why synthesis is wrong
[1:59:08] <%X2Eliah> who is*
[1:59:10] <+Ropcord> he's something of a scientist himself
[1:59:10] <+dante_must_die_exe> can't you make Saren SHOOT himself?
[1:59:11] <+MelodyMedley> Greeen
[1:59:12] <superstarshizzy> the power of robot friendship
[1:59:12] <AngryAsian5> Guess who Blue represents LUL
[1:59:13] <tranquilturnip> ftw the ending of ME3 is runescape
[1:59:13] <%ScottishMadJacko> TIM is control and Anderson is destroy
[1:59:14] <peachy996> All Three Endings are Saren, TIM and Anderson
[1:59:14] <SiameseSneeze> DESTROY
[1:59:15] <AluxStreams> Saren wants to turn into a toilet.
[1:59:17] <Pookiedaexzile> EVEN MASS EFFECT HATES MORALIST
[1:59:18] <superstarshizzy> just like my personas
[1:59:19] <+aartbastiaan> @X2Eliah Anderson
[1:59:21] <+Deebo305> @xerotwo Anderson
[1:59:21] <jackelzxaa> Kill saren in one hit
[1:59:21] <+evbites> @Deano8817 no destroy is
[1:59:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BLUE IS THE CHOICE
[1:59:22] <$LightningLynx89> @X2Eliah The only correct option
[1:59:23] <%Daxalog> """Pals"""
[1:59:23] <+michingmallecho> Lets just come together and fuck KomodoHype
[1:59:28] <BlackStarAura> All endings are fucked in their own way
[1:59:31] <%X2Eliah> ANDERSON?!
[1:59:32] <+MKUltima> Synthesis is the best conclusion but Saren reached it for the wrong reasons
[1:59:32] <jorniev> they gave him a mesiah complex
[1:59:32] <tranquilturnip> the power of Guthix
[1:59:33] <SaltyAzteca> PLOT BARRIER ACTIVATE
[1:59:33] <+aartbastiaan> DESTROY IS THE ONLY CHOICE
[1:59:34] <%scaryboisupreme> YEAH SAREN'S SHITTY HOVERBOARD
[1:59:34] <%twistedj3ster> It's Neo Cortex!
[1:59:35] <%X2Eliah> BUT I HATE ANDERSON
[1:59:35] <ammobasket> He just wants to hang out
[1:59:37] <wolverinewaswrong> I forgot he flew in this fight

[2:02:59] <jorniev> nutting is seen as a Chad move by other species
[2:03:03] <jackelzxaa> Shepard has sex with liara 4 times in this game…or is it 3?

[2:05:09] <%justnathan18> @theteamakerofiowa No.
[2:05:10] <DSD24> We need "evidence"
[2:05:10] <BrOOnoh> you totally can
[2:05:11] <+GuilKato> if only their hardsuits had Cameras on them to record all their interactions
[2:05:16] <AluxStreams> These guys are more useless than the Jedi Council.
[2:05:17] <+GuilKato> because then they would have video proof
[2:05:25] <RyuuAoi> I can't wait until we have holograms so we can just punch holograms.

[2:05:59] <AngryAsian5> Someone has to hold the idiot ball in the story LUL
[2:05:59] <peachy996> Keep this Council alive for "Ah Yes Reapers"
[2:05:59] <%Ranryu692> doesn't Mass Effect's communications rely on quantum entanglement?
[2:05:59] <%machshop> WHOOPS! is the best one
[2:06:00] <theteamakerofiowa> WAIT USELESS?
[2:06:01] <%castlerock42> You wouldn't think Sparatus was that fit, but he does mental gymnastics like no one else.
[2:06:03] <jackelzxaa> And then before illos some of them get extra dialog again
[2:06:04] <spike_j_wolfwood> The Council: "Don't fear the reaper, dude."
[2:06:06] <+froduck42> they're almost as useless as the council from MK
[2:06:06] <+aartbastiaan> FeelsBadMan
[2:06:07] <+even_the_yuenglings> pressly LuL
[2:06:07] <tranquilturnip> it is impossible how useless they are

[2:06:08] <+Sendrak70> Anyone else sad that the mass effect 3 multiplayer isnt in this?
[2:06:10] <%MichaelDood> I love the tone of Joker there like you can hear him smiling.
[2:06:11] <%StaceMcGate> Presley, the most important character of ME 1
[2:06:13] <+aartbastiaan> Pressley actually becomes not racist
[2:06:16] <+michingmallecho> "I have video evidence" "Shepard, we don't believe you"
[2:06:16] <%Ranryu692> how do you lose the signal on quantum entanglement LUL
[2:06:17] <Sunstalker> Pressley is more useful then the council. So always sacrifice the council
[2:06:18] <%Jumpie8> like most Canadian governments
[2:06:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @thomasoftroy Problem is the next 3 are even worse
[2:06:21] <dd44dostivei> wow tali was right, the normandy does run quiet
[2:06:22] <jackelzxaa> Joker has stuff to say too
[2:06:23] <ScreamLord> The only reason to save them is because the replacements in ME3 are worse
[2:06:23] <RyuuAoi> Yeah they suck. What were you gonna get from that?
[2:06:24] <%LumberjackJack> I think the crew has a new line or 2 once you leave the Citadel for the last time
[2:06:24] <Necnill> Can we date Kaidan? I forget
[2:06:27] <+vaderxyz1970> Are we going to "Talk" to Liara?

[2:07:04] <Jane_Lo> @Necnill a femshep can, in 3 you can as both, since he was originally to be intended to bi (according to restored files)
[2:07:04] <RyuuAoi> No kissing allowed
[2:07:04] <+michingmallecho> Now kiss me Kaiden, like you mean it

[2:14:21] <%LumberjackJack> No one's perfect
[2:14:21] <ARDM112> Collectors are the "direct" reason that you die, Pat
[2:14:24] <%ScottishMadJacko> yeah, it is his fault

[2:14:30] <+MelodyMedley> Yeah, it's too bad
[2:14:31] <%snow_bush> Counterpoint, he gets you a cyberdong indirectly
[2:14:31] <Ipsenscastle> Joker literally gets you killed unnecessarily
[2:14:34] <%justnathan18> Kaiden is a higher ranking officer with superpowers. Ashley had a bad haircut.
[2:14:36] <BlackStarAura> Fuck you Udina

[2:15:04] <ItIsSky> LUL

[2:15:08] <%cvp5127> walk away
[2:15:10] <aiutare47> it takes an entire Citadel Fleet to kill one reaper with heavy casualties. In 3 you kill like, 5.
[2:15:10] <+Ropcord> joker is the first human to kill a reaper and the only other playable character in the series so he's pretty alright

[2:15:20] <%ingman112> I cannot describe how uncomfortable “blussy” makes me
[2:15:22] <jackelzxaa> I know ashley would but i dont know if kaiden has unique dialog for terra firma guy
[2:15:22] <AluxStreams> Shepard just plugs his ears and covers his eyes here.

[2:35:27] <@Moobot> @PhantomMiG I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 35m.
[2:35:38] <%PhantomMiG> Okay
[2:35:38] <+Grayhammatter> did we kill the spacist?
[2:35:49] <fugly_nick> Yes
[2:35:50] <zanzibarian_hamster> yes
[2:35:53] <+aartbastiaan> @Grayhammatter one of them
[2:35:55] <Wolfstriker121> yes
[2:35:57] <%Nuclearcherries> Yes
[2:35:57] <%justnathan18> @Grayhammatter Yes indeedy
[2:36:02] <Pookiedaexzile> Mission Complete
[2:36:06] <BlackStarAura> The bitch is dead.
[2:36:16] <fugly_nick> Mission not complee, there's still more
[2:36:21] <Ashrox117> Discovered a whole party to drop off at ground zero tho
[2:36:21] <zanzibarian_hamster> Just to clarify, she's specist not racist? I mean she is also literally xenophobic
[2:36:32] <%democrazyyy> ashley isnt that bad once you get her to stop being spacist, unfortunately shes still just a boring human
[2:36:51] <+aartbastiaan> on the citadel she says "I can't tell the animals from the aliens" even though there are no animals
[2:37:05] <Ashrox117> LOL
[2:37:08] <mrtRoll001> Ashley did nothing wrong
[2:37:09] <%justnathan18> You know what gets me? A lot of people in this game use the phrase "thats how the WORLD works", like while actively being on the citadel.
[2:37:16] <fugly_nick> That and comparing alien races to pets
[2:37:22] <%PhantomMiG> So does anyone have any clarification about what woolie means by nuclear 3-d because that sounds like one of the most insane things he has ever said to me as a materials engineer
[2:37:40] <%Papa_Bearman> Ashley's the hot one, so she lives.  I have spoken.
[2:37:42] <zanzibarian_hamster> Things are also measured in hours/days, pounds/meters, it's a mess really
[2:37:42] <ioci2112> @aartbastiaan that line was only supposed to trigger around keepers, but it's bugged
[2:37:53] <Ashrox117> Like orbitals or something?
[2:38:08] <mrtRoll001> Space hours, space days, space pounds, space meters
[2:38:10] <%X2Eliah> @ioci2112 I don't buy it
[2:38:11] <%dekkitout> @Papa_Bearman Morally compromised peen has spoken
[2:38:21] <%QueequegTheater> Someone help I'm trapped in FFXIV relic hell
[2:38:27] <+aartbastiaan> @ioci2112 huh
[2:38:27] <%Papa_Bearman> I've accepted it.
[2:38:33] <%democrazyyy> i actually like that part of ashleys motivation is that her grandfather was the general who surrendered at shanxi and her family gets crap for it for no reason
[2:38:36] <Ashrox117> You don’t pay my sub
[2:38:38] <+aartbastiaan> @Papa_Bearman and then she stops being hot in ME2
[2:38:40] <+Grayhammatter> @QueequegTheater there is no help
[2:38:42] <%X2Eliah> @QueequegTheater ouch
[2:38:51] <%democrazyyy> doesnt make up for other failings but its not a bad character detail
[2:38:51] <%QueequegTheater> so many books
[2:38:54] <%PhantomMiG> To claify woolie talked about nuclear 3-d printing is what sounded insane
[2:38:54] <fugly_nick> @ioci2112 I don't believe that for a second. It's too in line with the rest of her dialogue
[2:38:59] <%Papa_Bearman> Yeah, but you can't fuck her in ME2, so who cares?
[2:39:18] <Ashrox117> @phantommig Oh wow idk then
[2:39:23] <peachy996> Ashley trades in the alien mistrust with just not trusting you ever in 3. And I don't like her knockoff Miranda look
[2:39:25] <+DankDreamTeam> one day pats gonna nail that dance
[2:39:27] <%QueequegTheater> @fugly_nick Quote another line where she compares the aliens to literal animals then
[2:39:34] <Ashrox117> @phantommig Sounds like hadron collider work
[2:39:34] <peachy996> So this was a better way to go
[2:39:37] <%dekkitout> @PhantomMiG Nuke powered 3d printers, or 3d printing on the atomic scale?
[2:39:37] <%justnathan18> Is Woolie okay btw? Wasnt he supposed to stream today?
[2:39:53] <%QueequegTheater> His back continues to not exist
[2:39:54] <Diablo169> This is why I always let her die on Eden Prime. Kaiden is many things, but space racist is not one of them
[2:39:59] <%neroforte177> @justnathan18 back pain again
[2:39:59] <zanzibarian_hamster> He took damage laughing at disco elysium
[2:40:00] <Sp3ctre48> Woolie threw his back out laughing too hard at Disco
[2:40:08] <+aartbastiaan> @QueequegTheater she does say something like "human or alien, we're all animals" later which is ambiguous
[2:40:09] <%afronooch> @justnathan18 he tweeted that his back was hurting so hes gonna rest up some more
[2:40:10] <%QueequegTheater> @Diablo169 Neither is she
[2:40:12] <peachy996> Kaiden is a lack of things
[2:40:13] <%justnathan18> Oh poor Woolie.
[2:40:17] <%X2Eliah> @justnathan18 Woolie literally does not have the backbone for streaming
[2:40:22] <%AzureGale> Woolie spent his entire nut on shivers
[2:40:25] <peachy996> Interesting being one of them
[2:40:30] <%QueequegTheater> @aartbastiaan that's a misquote of her that only plays if she's dead
[2:40:41] <Jane_Lo> @peachy996 idk why they went for her with that way (plus lots of makeup), cause her me1 is miles better, there's a good mod that restores her me1 look for me3 and it's awesome
[2:41:02] <peachy996> I hate they rmoved the bun
[2:41:05] <+aartbastiaan> @QueequegTheater "human or alien, we're all just animals" how was it a misquote LUL
[2:41:06] <%QueequegTheater> I want mods that give her even more of a bimbo look
[2:41:13] <%PhantomMiG> I think base on a short context I got that woolie thinks that in our lifetime that 3-d printable nuclear weapons could happen in our lifetime. Or atleast something as powerful
[2:41:14] <peachy996> The bun works for her
[2:41:19] <DSD24> I bet those exist
[2:41:22] <Sp3ctre48> It's like they wanted her to be Miranda 2, it's weird
[2:41:29] <%justnathan18> Ive always been curious, do Reggie and the other guys have other jobs? or like are they on the Woolie payroll
[2:41:36] <%QueequegTheater> @aartbastiaan it's an in-story misquote of the "aliens from the animals" line
[2:41:45] <Sp3ctre48> I don't even like Ashley but she got done dirty in ME3
[2:41:55] <%QueequegTheater> @justnathan18 They live the hustle life
[2:41:58] <fugly_nick> Pretty sure Minh is primarily Woolie's editor, I don't know about Reggie
[2:42:02] <Ashrox117> @phantommig I would not want to handle the spool of plutonium fuel then
[2:42:03] <%X2Eliah> @justnathan18 Idk about Reggie.... Minh I think is on woolie's payroll
[2:42:06] <+aartbastiaan> Some Ashley quotes: "Jealous? Of you? You're not even our species!" "You want to get involved with some alien? Go ahead." "Make nice with the bug-eyed monsters." "I am no fan of aliens" "I can't tell the aliens from the animals"

[2:42:22] <zanzibarian_hamster> Enriching uranium is really tricky though, what was his logic? I don't really listen to the podcast anymore
[2:42:23] <peachy996> I think I tolerate Ashley more than I ever tolerate Liara
[2:42:26] <Wolfstriker121> ashley was a big spaceist
[2:42:37] <peachy996> If only I could drop 5 Nukes on Liara....
[2:42:52] <%QueequegTheater> Literally all of those lines go away if you talk her down from being so antagonistic, just like Garrus
[2:42:52] <Wolfstriker121> on my para run i killed her off on my reng run i kept her
[2:42:52] <Sp3ctre48> Liara just makes me laugh
[2:42:57] <%justnathan18> Minh earns his paycheck at least. I miss a lot of Woolies streams, and the youtube account is really well done.
[2:42:57] <@CreepyPorpoise> I got here in time for brb today
[2:42:58] <DSD24> Ashley gets better though
[2:43:04] <%PhantomMiG> Which would be a huge suprise to me considering I just finished my degree for materials and just did a module on additive manfuactoring design
[2:43:05] <Sp3ctre48> it's adorable how forced she is on you

[2:46:16] <brisk_dacat> Why can’t you let me be filthy father
[2:46:17] <Ashrox117> My dog foams when she sniffs stuff and I alway worry people think I’m out with a rabid german shepherd
[2:46:21] <Coystick> He's being such a good sport
[2:46:23] <ChaosedStar> breeding*
[2:46:29] <AluxStreams> He's being a good boy even though he hates it.
[2:46:30] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat  Pat do you have any idea what Woolie means by Nuclear 3-D printing which sounds absoultely insane given my understanding of the context. Espically as a materials engineer who did a masters module in additive manufactoring
[2:46:40] <+wolfofsound> omg he snores awake too
[2:46:41] <seniormeatbox> I clean my son, he is becoming powerful
[2:46:45] <Sunstalker> Just live inside Gief's burgers
[2:46:51] <%justnathan18> Give him that bone!
[2:46:54] <aiutare47> Its a metaphor
[2:46:55] <%QueequegTheater> He's having back injury nightmares
[2:46:57] <DatAsuna> it's from the UFOs
[2:47:00] <fugly_nick> Woolie would never do that
[2:47:01] <%Daxalog> 3d Printing Nukes
[2:47:05] <Coystick> A cute
[2:47:06] <+ThomasOfTroy> Woolie was just trying to say that people would be able to 3d print nukes
[2:47:06] <%walternatorz> Did Pat just bark?
[2:47:07] <dd44dostivei> easy nuke replication by the masses
[2:47:08] <+ThomasOfTroy> Wrongly
[2:47:08] <%blastazoid00> bork
[2:47:11] <+aartbastiaan> Woolie will nuclear 3-D print love chemicals
[2:47:11] <%ExpressNode> Time to 3d print some weapons of mass destruction
[2:47:13] <Drunkengen> is he just standing still?
[2:47:15] <aiutare47> Woolie was referring to a thought experiment I think
[2:47:17] <%dekkitout> The joke about mass fabricating nukes?
[2:47:17] <+michingmallecho> hasHug hasHug
[2:47:20] <peachy996> Woolie would never get things wrong
[2:47:21] <sweatch0> Thus spoke Giefie
[2:47:22] <Aydarkzero> my stream glitched and after gief spoke he vanished
[2:47:29] <+D00msDayDan> Sounds like 3d printing on the atomic level maybe
[2:47:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> Is he talking about building atomic nuclei one particle at a time? That's not gonna be possible.
[2:47:30] <Ashrox117> Biden is trying to ban ghost nukes
[2:47:35] <brisk_dacat> Wonder how fast he destroys that treat
[2:47:36] <%dekkitout> Eh?
[2:47:36] <aiutare47> There is no meme, he said it
[2:47:38] <+aartbastiaan> he hates it for no reason LUL
[2:47:42] <WSintai> He doesn't like it or Drama that much, they are "artsy"
[2:47:43] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt It's self-explanatory
[2:47:43] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> That's it. He doesn't like it
[2:47:43] <RedPlasticCup> he HATES IT
[2:47:44] <%UvBenServed> Meme?
[2:47:45] <%Aluminar> he has no imagination
[2:47:46] <Sunstalker> He actually says it himself, ti's afucking quote. LUL
[2:47:46] <dd44dostivei> it's that woolie hates conceptualization in DE
[2:47:46] <seniormeatbox> He thinks the prompts it makes are boring
[2:47:48] <DSD24> He never likes when ever conceptualization comes up
[2:47:50] <fugly_nick> Cuz it's artsy =
[2:47:51] <thetunnelhomer> He just hates it
[2:47:51] <%Aluminar> love is chemicals
[2:47:52] <Profmcstevie> Any quote for that perspective?
[2:47:52] <%Daxalog> Its too high brow.
[2:47:52] <seniormeatbox> and don't add anything meaningful
[2:47:53] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Woolie hated the art cop responses and did not understand them
[2:47:53] <%Blackleafx> He thinks its pretentious
[2:47:55] <%AzureGale> Woolie was bagging on some Conceptulization dialogue early on
[2:47:55] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt Woolie hates creativity
[2:47:55] <srv4254> he thinks its useless info
[2:47:55] <Sunstalker> He just hates what conceptualisation says.
[2:47:56] <$dalmek> he just wasn't a fan of when it chimed in
[2:47:57] <brisk_dacat> Ask him on Monday
[2:47:57] <aiutare47> He said it adds very little and feels off topic
[2:47:58] <Ipsenscastle> Woolie is completely unable to relate to the process of having ideas
[2:48:00] <iosephe> Yes Pat
[2:48:00] <zanzibarian_hamster> He gets annoyed by the things it comes up with
[2:48:01] <RedPlasticCup> idk ask him!!
[2:48:03] <fugly_nick> It should be his favorite, but for some reason it's not
[2:48:04] <%MelBrooksKA> Woolie isn't real so he hates conceptualizing things
[2:48:05] <+GuilKato> pat you can ask him about it during the podcast :D
[2:48:07] <sendart> He hates Art
[2:48:08] <+michingmallecho> More human than human
[2:48:09] <@CreepyPorpoise> wow
[2:48:11] <Ashrox117> Woolie hates Arts
[2:48:11] <Vapor_Pressure> Woolie fucks with Shivers hardcore
[2:48:15] <%MidnightBurst12> it sure is
[2:48:16] <brisk_dacat> Woolie doesn’t want to be woke
[2:48:20] <%QueequegTheater> For the same reason Woolie decided Naoto is trans: literally no reason with no backing evidence
[2:48:21] <+MightyDuckShoes> He doesn't understand conceptualization. He constantly sandbags and logicbombs them
[2:48:23] <%AzureGale> Contrast that to shivers where Woolie fucking orgasms over every one of its statements
[2:48:25] <%Agami23> knowing woolie, he thinks art cop is normal and right
[2:48:27] <+senfood> Of course he hates Art Cop. He used to be in art school.
[2:48:29] <@CreepyPorpoise> Art cop good
[2:48:30] <+SirCacaPee> AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH
[2:48:30] <%AllenDeadman> ayyy
[2:48:30] <%walternatorz> but pat, you played death stranding perfectly. you get art.
[2:48:31] <%zyberion626> woolie went to art college and therefore he hates art
[2:48:31] <Ipsenscastle> LUL
[2:48:34] <%skeleklng> You hear about the dude that sold a "statue of nothing" for tens of thousands of dollars?
[2:48:34] <awalbaru> True
[2:48:34] <+natedrago> catJAM
[2:48:35] <iosephe> Art is just electrical signals
[2:48:37] <Ashrox117> OH NO
[2:48:39] <+aartbastiaan> chemicals told him to hate conceptualization
[2:48:40] <+MightyDuckShoes> He also got mad at a joke before the punchline.
[2:48:41] <DSD24> Hands shake from how shit it all is
[2:48:43] <%justnathan18> Im glad Woolie has gotten less edgy with age.
[2:48:44] <%dekkitout> This sounds like a very Pat thing of Woolie to do. Are we exiting the age of fire into the age of dark?
[2:48:47] <peachy996> Love Is a Chemical is my favorite Pat Benatar song
[2:48:48] <+even_the_yuenglings> SourPls
[2:48:48] <+trackles_64> I just finished mass effect 2 for the twentieth time
[2:48:49] <morow1ec> woolie apologising for sounding like moralist during that convo with sunday friend was the best
[2:48:51] <Sunstalker> Conceptualisation would have told Woolie to not naruto run in high school
[2:48:53] <LordOfThePoultry> SourPls
[2:48:54] <+natedrago> no signal
[2:48:55] <%PhantomMiG> Okay I just going to say 3-d printing a nuke is not happening at anytime unless we start breaking some laws of feasability
[2:48:55] <%MugenSandan> @patstaresat Woolie is a massive hipster and Conceptualization forces him to actually see that from the outside
[2:48:58] <BlackStarAura> Disco’s on sale at PSN
[2:48:59] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> i hate this music lol

[2:52:27] <%hrbeck_> you're two days from retirement
[2:52:28] <Sp3ctre48> They come up with such an arbitrary reason here, like they say that the Terminus systems are basically lawless in the next game
[2:52:30] <stantheman_97> don't remember which species
[2:52:30] <+evbites> @sendart look at his ears
[2:52:32] <fugly_nick> @sendart I think they changed it to be more consistent with ME3

[2:53:03] <AluxStreams> But fuck the Council tho.
[2:53:04] <%ArcanumArcanum> Anderson needs to ease up on the eyeliner

[2:53:33] <%Papa_Bearman> So can *everyone* in 'Mass Effect' hack?  Anderson's a military man; the fuck does HE know about hacking?!
[2:53:34] <%Ranryu692> to be fair, this song is terrible

[2:55:47] <%SABiscotti> garrus and shep romance have the best moment in Citadel imho
[2:55:47] <Alzero83> Your goal is to get to the Citadel DLC @PatStaresAt

[2:55:57] <balthazar758> garrus the partyguy
[2:55:57] <+MightyDuckShoes> @aartbastiaan Well they aren't originally from Egypt so it's kind of like calling Native Americans "Indians"?

[2:56:58] <ZeroWhitewolfx> PAWNCH
[2:56:58] <%ScottishMadJacko> anderson is great
[2:57:01] <$Faustgesicht> Gotta thin fast
[2:57:03] <otakon17> he's an ass
[2:57:03] <+Ropcord> he made that decision YEARS ago
[2:57:04] <%Ranryu692> he probably had some elaborate ruse planned, but then saw Udina and was like "nah fuck him"
[2:57:05] <%Tiablo_> He probably waited for udina to walk in
[2:57:06] <RedPlasticCup> when i see udina its on sight
[2:57:08] <iggeh> udina violence is alright
[2:57:09] <+michingmallecho> He was on the elevator just waiting to punch a fool
[2:57:11] <$Faustgesicht> Anderson knew here was there
[2:57:11] <Alzero83> Time for some Blussy
[2:57:13] <ChaosedStar> twitch like lagged and i saw him punch him like 3 times lmao

[2:57:15] <Diablo169> Keith David don't fuck around
[2:57:16] <%Garthunox> nah he made the decision on the walk over
[2:57:17] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm just impressed he cold cocks him in one punch
[2:57:18] <JetpackMcQuack> Old man strength
[2:57:18] <ZeroWhitewolfx> I mean i would too
[2:57:18] <%Mr_Pylon> hitting Udina is just gravy
[2:57:20] <ScreamLord> Udina has a very punchable face
[2:57:21] <thetunnelhomer> I wonder if anyone chose Udina as Councilor for their first playthrough
[2:57:24] <fugly_nick> I like to think he does that as a councillor regularly too
[2:57:24] <+aartbastiaan> Nah he wanted to do that since forever
[2:57:26] <AngryAsian5> Anderson saw him and chose violence
[2:57:30] <%moonmintparadise> 100%
[2:57:34] <%X2Eliah> @thetunnelhomer I did
[2:57:35] <Pookiedaexzile> "bitch aint got hands
[2:57:36] <Alzero83> time for the SECKS!!!
[2:57:37] <+trackles_64> The Csec scene is better
[2:57:41] <$apolitenoob> @GarbageNirvana Udina's got politician's jaw, he would have gone down regardless
[2:57:41] <plaguedoctor_syan> I CHOSE VIOLENCE

[3:08:57] <sweatch0> Its an alchemy ingrediant
[3:08:57] <heartlesshealer> But can you sell baby?
[3:08:58] <theladygrayson> Sell the baby to free up inventory
[3:08:58] <%blastazoid00> Does the baby give you any buffs?
[3:08:59] <Gorshum> It's big true.
[3:08:59] <Aydarkzero> ?
[3:09:00] <ZeroWhitewolfx> doodWat
[3:09:00] <+pmtriox> I'm still waiting for the punchline here
[3:09:00] <%ScottishMadJacko> ive seen that image around loads but never had the context
[3:09:00] <crookedfinger68> space baby
[3:09:01] <stantheman_97> can you sell or discard the baby?
[3:09:01] <hippofant> Aerie, not Aery
[3:09:02] <Diablo169> Bag of holding time
[3:09:02] <%chance_h> Nice, backpack baby
[3:09:02] <%justnathan18> DDO YOU GET TO NAME YOUR BABY
[3:09:03] <spike_j_wolfwood> death stranding?
[3:09:05] <%dekkitout> Can the baby be rearranged in the attache case?
[3:09:06] <thetunnelhomer> Baldur's Gate 2 was pretty wild.
[3:09:09] <Pookiedaexzile> extra incentive not to die
[3:09:09] <chimeraxmachina> Stop that
[3:09:09] <+vaderxyz1970> Is the baby used for crafting?
[3:09:11] <signofzeta> Remember how Aeire and Jaheira share the same romance music?
[3:09:12] <%AlteisenReiseZ> "Let's make another!" *YOUR INVENTORY IS FULL*
[3:09:12] <Diablo169> Its Aerie
[3:09:12] <%LeiaSkynoober> aeriespacebaby
[3:09:15] <%justnathan18> Illos looks way better
[3:09:16] <+FoolsArcade> this place looks like Returnal
[3:09:17] <$hattrick61> What about the dragon age chick that makes you renounce your race?
[3:09:17] <+ratchetex> yeah this map rocks
[3:09:18] <zanzibarian_hamster> You also have to watch what you say around her otherwise you'll piss her off and she doesn't fall for you, more involved than "I am wanting to have relationship with you"
[3:09:19] <+itsgundamu> whoa is he almost done with the game?
[3:09:19] <Coystick> Death's Gate
[3:09:19] <%Papa_Bearman> THAT GETH GOT *DUNKED*.
[3:09:19] <%DakotaMacDoodle> shits crazy
[3:09:21] <ape_hawk> if they ever remake baldurs gate 2, you think theyll let you tag the baby as a junk item?
[3:09:22] <Profmcstevie> Uh oh, over the encumbrance limit.... FBCatch BabyRage
[3:09:23] <omniv_of_g0r> I love Illos
[3:09:25] <+evbites> fuck
[3:09:26] <zanzibarian_hamster> Not perfect, but better
[3:09:27] <Sp3ctre48> wft were those geth doing
[3:09:33] <$Sarevic> Oh my fuck I never made it into Throne of Bhaal, that's amazing LOL
[3:09:40] <mrtRoll001> Looks like Warframe
[3:09:41] <Oxybe> Can you make a sick battleaxe by crafting the baby?
[3:09:41] <%Papa_Bearman> What class is Patron Shepardo?
[3:09:42] <%zyberion626> @ape_hawk not in Texas
[3:09:43] <Coystick> God their moonwalk
[3:09:46] <zanzibarian_hamster> They did remake Baldurs gate 2, it wasn't great
[3:09:51] <SlimeSlimeSlime> This makes me want to play Halo again
[3:10:00] <alextrebeken> wiki says it was stillborn
[3:10:01] <$Ziegsy> Equip the baby as a one-handed
[3:10:06] <heartlesshealer> the moonwalk is fucking fantastic
[3:10:09] <%ScottishMadJacko> remember carnage clears heat
[3:10:11] <%X2Eliah> Yeah this is very Halo, eh
[3:10:12] <+aartbastiaan> This is why you play infiltrator
[3:10:16] <%Papa_Bearman> Use the baby as a grenade.
[3:10:16] <%ScottishMadJacko> so does marksman
[3:10:17] <ChaosedStar> The child of Aerie and [Gorion's Ward]. He seems quite cute.
[3:10:19] <thetunnelhomer> God Vanguard is busted
[3:10:21] <peachy996> Don't forget about your powrs when on overheatt
[3:10:26] <ioci2112> remember killing that armature in therum? now kill 2 of them, and absolutely dunk on them
[3:10:28] <%Papa_Bearman> Kill it in front of your enemies as an example of your potential for getting the job done.
[3:10:28] <thetunnelhomer> Vanguard is the best ME2 class btw
[3:10:30] <Ashrox117> Switching weapons is faster than reloading private
[3:10:30] <peachy996> You have biotics
[3:10:35] <%Papa_Bearman> These are the inu'sannon.
[3:10:38] <Sp3ctre48> haha they sure do look exactly like that
[3:10:42] <AluxStreams> They made statues of humans for some reason.
[3:10:43] <Oxybe> A) can you item dupe the baby and b) can you dual weild them @patstaresat
[3:10:43] <+itsgundamu> They look nothing like that
[3:10:45] <%LumberjackJack> It's just sick AF art they liked
[3:10:45] <%Papa_Bearman> They're the species that came BEFORE the protheans.
[3:10:45] <$realm_forge> Get those doom eternal hot swaps
[3:10:46] <Ashrox117> Oh look Returnal
[3:10:47] <+FoolsArcade> This is absolutely Returnals influence
[3:10:49] <thetunnelhomer> Inuretconna
[3:10:51] <+pmtriox> imagine that, imagine they didn't think about that when they made mass effect 3
[3:10:51] <stantheman_97> not space jockies
[3:10:55] <logothete2401> I think it's implied that these ruins are Inusannon
[3:10:55] <Profmcstevie> I can't believe humans don't look like Picasso
[3:10:57] <+litre_of_milk> litre_of_milk subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:10:58] <peachy996> Yeah they're an older race we thought were protheans
[3:11:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Why didn't they just make the overheat the same speed as a reload in ME2
[3:11:08] <+evbites> @pmtriox or 2
[3:11:09] <heartlesshealer> babies do that
[3:11:11] <%barrakuta371> Yeah that was a weird retcon
[3:11:12] <+aartbastiaan> what's cool is that in the Prothean cycle they were pretty much the sole rulers of the whole galaxy
[3:11:14] <%walternatorz> he loves shit too
[3:11:18] <%Papa_Bearman> Yeah, the third game says that they're the species that came prior, the inu'sannon.
[3:11:18] <%chance_h> It’s Greg, he’s a random alien that thankfully died out
[3:11:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Like it would serve teh same function
[3:11:24] <$hattrick61> Its retconned that thats the precursor race BEFORE the protheans
[3:11:27] <thetunnelhomer> I'll never forgive ME2 for adding Ammo.
[3:11:32] <SomersaultJustice> this sounds like dkc3 music
[3:11:37] <$hattrick61> The innushon or something
[3:11:37] <+trackles_64> how are you not max xp?
[3:11:42] <harryboi1997> Too stronk
[3:11:49] <%Papa_Bearman> Ya damn robit.
[3:11:51] <+evbites> @aartbastiaan and they were imperialist assholes that had slave races
[3:11:57] <Pookiedaexzile> there's no reason for the ammo thing at all
[3:12:05] <peachy996> @PatStaresAt Please remember to use your Biotics on the Citadel space fight
[3:12:07] <+aartbastiaan> @evbites they were the Roman Empire
[3:12:07] <+pmtriox> @pmtriox 2 you could argue its been thousands of years of genetic an molecular tampering at least, but in 3 they made protheans resemble collectors for some reason
[3:12:10] <%ScottishMadJacko> protheans were basically the empire from star wars
[3:12:11] <+aartbastiaan> more or less
[3:12:13] <%X2Eliah> So tbh I never actually liked the shooty bits of Ilos, they feel too constrained and yet empty
[3:12:29] <thetunnelhomer> I wish they added the overheat system to ME2, but I guess that would have been a bit much
[3:12:29] <+evbites> And javik exists to tell liara how stupid she is.
[3:12:41] <viewtifulr> Lost his fucking nut that is
[3:12:46] <peachy996> Which is why Javik is awsome
[3:12:50] <+Subdotmission> this is gears of war
[3:12:51] <Ashrox117> I feel like this game was a lot of corner camping against geth primes
[3:12:52] <%justnathan18> I love that Javik just shits on everybodu
[3:12:57] <%Papa_Bearman> WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!?
[3:12:58] <%X2Eliah> 50 000 year old ruin with modern elevator buttons
[3:12:59] <+pmtriox> that warble game music jesus
[3:13:00] <%Papa_Bearman> WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!?
[3:13:04] <thetunnelhomer> Javik shouldn't be so cool.
[3:13:08] <signofzeta> Predator X for Wrex!!!!
[3:13:10] <+michingmallecho> hacker man
[3:13:10] <Pookiedaexzile> This is Gears of Wars color Pallete in 2
[3:13:19] <%justnathan18> To be fair, the citadel is like 50k years old
[3:13:21] <+aartbastiaan> One of the coolest lines is "Stand amongst the ashes of a trillion dead souls, and ask the ghosts if honor matters. The silence is your answer."
[3:13:22] <+evbites> @peachy996 he's great you to tell him to not be a dick to scared refugees
[3:13:45] <peachy996> Yeah you have to make him give pople hope lol
[3:13:45] <Ardailec> Did they cut the simon says mini game?
[3:14:06] <fugly_nick> Yeah they replaced it with a real minigame
[3:14:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Like you need em
[3:14:10] <thetunnelhomer> Javik is utterly shocked that Salarians managed to make it into space.
[3:14:10] <GameOver_Here> More than enough to kill anything that moves
[3:14:13] <ape_hawk> now you can nut 5 times before your gun hurts
[3:14:14] <%X2Eliah> @Ardailec almost, it pops up in two places still
[3:14:17] <%ScottishMadJacko> @justnathan18 its like a mllion year sold
[3:14:18] <Ashrox117> She said that ?
[3:14:23] <stealthfart> Play with Zangief stream
[3:14:23] <%Papa_Bearman> Must be some generator.
[3:14:26] <+itsgundamu> he's also shocked they could write
[3:14:27] <+aartbastiaan> @thetunnelhomer and that Asari can write LUL
[3:14:33] <Ardailec> weird
[3:14:39] <stormhawk9891> @Ardailec Not in the PS4 version at least
[3:14:39] <%justnathan18> and it has elevator
[3:14:42] <%justnathan18> s
[3:14:54] <%StrawberryPantsu> Ew
[3:14:56] <+evbites> Javik: Gives a heartfelt speech.   shep: Did you mean any of that?          Javik: it worked
[3:15:02] <WSintai> Pat's cumming all over that wall!
[3:15:09] <thetunnelhomer> Also chat. Go look up what untranslated Turians sound like. It's horrifying.
[3:15:10] <+D00msDayDan> no pat, you ARE the wall
[3:15:10] <viewtifulr> So the blussy wasn't enough friction huh?
[3:15:12] <%Eilocke> INTO a wall?
[3:15:12] <LordOfThePoultry> what difficulty is pat on?
[3:15:13] <heartlesshealer> pat has to face the wall tonight
[3:15:17] <%Papa_Bearman> Jesus, that was complete and utter destruction.
[3:15:22] <%ScottishMadJacko> upstairs
[3:15:25] <%dekkitout> Shooting ropes left and right
[3:15:29] <+holyxgrale> Wrex what is this
[3:15:36] <%Papa_Bearman> It's like when you give Wakka the blitzball that turns your enemies into stone; you don't even have to worry about combat anymore.
[3:15:41] <Ashrox117> Pat Cole Train
[3:15:49] <%justnathan18> Javik has all of the tact and care of a super depressed dude whose whole race died out
[3:15:53] <%Papa_Bearman> OH, it's a maze!
[3:16:01] <%Papa_Bearman> I thought you had to line shit up or something.
[3:16:05] <%Papa_Bearman> I LOVE THIS PART OF THE GAME.
[3:16:11] <%Papa_Bearman> I love this console so much.
[3:16:16] <%JamesCorck> Ah yes, my favorite part of the game right here º3º
[3:16:16] <+evbites> @justnathan18 he is shepered if they failed.
[3:16:20] <ape_hawk> HERE IT COMES
[3:16:21] <DSD24> I hope Vigil isn't eye searing

[3:16:39] <thetunnelhomer> Hey, these don't sound like Javik.
[3:16:43] <%justnathan18> @evbites Specficially renegade shep
[3:16:53] <KaitlynnHere> What was that?? You have ice cream?
[3:16:54] <%AFellowDegen> YOU DINT BRING LIARA TO THE PROTHEAN PLACE
[3:16:55] <ape_hawk> HEY, THESE GUYS DONT SOUND JAMAICAN
[3:17:03] <Ashrox117> It says we need towels to defeat them
[3:17:06] <%dekkitout> Dang
[3:17:06] <WSintai> HDR hurts my eyes in general
[3:17:07] <DatAsuna> Javik explains these a bit too
[3:17:10] <DSD24> Its so bad Pat you don't even know
[3:17:10] <zanzibarian_hamster> "by the way your prothean is superb"
[3:17:11] <%justnathan18> I love that Liara is missin all of this Prothean shit
[3:17:11] <+holyxgrale> You don't even need hdr
[3:17:12] <+alphonseisbest> YUP
[3:17:13] <DatAsuna> Javik wasn't jamaican
[3:17:13] <+liquidzr0> @AFellowDegen i was just thinking that
[3:17:13] <%X2Eliah> Yeah original ME1 prothean ideas were totally reworked in 2/3
[3:17:17] <heartlesshealer> yeah don't make that hi res
[3:17:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Phil Lamar?
[3:17:20] <+natedrago> maybe javik just had an accent
[3:17:23] <KaitlynnHere> I can see that
[3:17:24] <fugly_nick> Vigil is even worse
[3:17:26] <%AzureGale> It says y'all are primitive
[3:17:33] <KaitlynnHere> Obi wan
[3:17:39] <%SABiscotti> I should go
[3:17:39] <+evbites> @justnathan18 yeah it's great
[3:17:40] <DatAsuna> the protheans spanne da whole galaxy, they probably had more than one accent
[3:17:41] <+D00msDayDan> wait, it's all loss?
[3:17:42] <ape_hawk> oh yeah, pat totes shoulda brought liara here
[3:17:45] <ape_hawk> ah well
[3:17:46] <+holyxgrale> repeating of course
[3:17:47] <AluxStreams> Love that bit at the end.
[3:17:47] <%X2Eliah> Why does vigil have FM Radio distortion?
[3:17:49] <TheMostAverageGamer4> those primitives
[3:17:49] <%Eilocke> character development is Shepherd saying WE should go
[3:17:51] <TioXyco> did they?
[3:17:52] <Sp3ctre48> I think all the Protheans we see in 3 had the accent
[3:17:54] <peachy996> Can they be stopped
[3:17:55] <AmuserName> That "cannot be stopped" line always gives me shivers.
[3:17:56] <doggieo> THE RUMBLING
[3:17:57] <%Papa_Bearman> I don't like how each sentence fragment sounds like they were said AS sentence fragments.  I wish they were given full sentences to say and then they were broken up in editing.
[3:17:57] <heartlesshealer> it's fine

[3:20:31] <Vapor_Pressure> atpCap fascinating
[3:20:33] <BigDaddyofCincinnati> Too late Pat you are trending on twitter
[3:20:35] <KaitlynnHere> It’s different
[3:20:36] <Sp3ctre48> If anything you're more railroaded to Liara after this game
[3:20:36] <%DianaTheAscian> well...
[3:20:36] <Sunstalker> Yeah, they're fictional, like James Small @PatStaresAt
[3:20:37] <WSintai> Fictional people; Like Paige! What a crazy caricature of a human being!
[3:20:37] <%AFellowDegen> #AshleydidNothingWrong
[3:20:41] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @Pookiedaexzile You stop that
[3:20:42] <%skeleklng> THIS IS WHY YOU'RE NOT CHECKMARKED VARIFIED PAT
[3:20:43] <Oxybe> As if twitter folks are people LUL

[3:20:48] <%Dakuu75> yeah,. remember that one guy? "Jesus Christ", he's my fave comic book character
[3:20:49] <JetpackMcQuack> That's what they're for PogChamp
[3:20:49] <peachy996> If Woolie disagrees thn he is a dumb
[3:20:50] <zanzibarian_hamster> wait until the fictional character rights hear about this you fictitionist
[3:20:50] <%bassoontyphoon> Liara “fill the blue with your gamer goo” T’soni
[3:20:52] <atgithursdays> Its fun to say bad shit about fake people until the fake people say something about genocide and then pat get mad
[3:20:52] <fugly_nick> I just realized, Woolie would totally romance Jack
[3:20:52] <+michingmallecho> Stanning for fictional characters LUL
[3:20:54] <stantheman_97> not from some of the idiots I've seen
[3:20:55] <%Papa_Bearman> Who here hasn't imagined Tali'Zorah face-down-ass-up on the bridge of the Normandy offered up for anyone who wants a turn?
[3:20:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> Some people think gamers should be found guilty of actual crimes against fictional characters
[3:21:05] <Ashrox117> Pat Stares at uploaded “Apology video about that stream…”
[3:21:10] <%walternatorz> saren put that tree there
[3:21:11] <Jetsfantasy> @fugly_nick Oh ABSOLUTELY he would
[3:21:13] <%MugenSandan> But Pat you do a podcast with a fictional character
[3:21:16] <spongeofmystery> Best part od the game incoming
[3:21:18] <+trackles_64> Zangeif is the ultimate trap
[3:21:18] <%maenos2> water?
[3:21:20] <+wizard_of_diamonds> RIP
[3:21:21] <hat_under_bread> You just jinxed us Wrex
[3:21:26] <+MightyDuckShoes> Is that pissing?
[3:21:27] <JetpackMcQuack> Is he pissing on the floor?
[3:21:30] <+michingmallecho> Aqua
[3:21:30] <%Nuclearcherries> @GeneralSCPatton That's daft. Gamers are already guilty of a lot of real life crimes
[3:21:31] <%maenos2> OH it's the game
[3:21:31] <%AFellowDegen> sucks Pat tkes Liara and throws her in the trash, she's the most developed character by far
[3:21:34] <heartlesshealer> zangief maxed out his Pat meter
[3:21:37] <peachy996> Woolie wouldn't romance Jack, I recall he said he didn't romance anyone. The perfect Wooli answer
[3:21:40] <%Papa_Bearman> Yeah, I heard some kind of trickling.
[3:21:48] <seniormeatbox> title theme
[3:21:50] <Sunstalker> Pat, many years ago. "We don't make fun of real people. James Small isn't a real person." kinamaLUL
[3:21:53] <+natedrago> is his balls healed?
[3:21:57] <spongeofmystery> @peachy996 the ultimate centrist
[3:21:58] <%Papa_Bearman> Oh, that trickling is in the game.
[3:22:02] <+evbites> @AFellowDegen is she o thought she was interesting as wet carboard
[3:22:07] <dauver> no chemicals allowed in Woolie lps
[3:22:07] <tanarath> Zangief will devour all
[3:22:16] <hat_under_bread> Permanent post-nut clarity.
[3:22:17] <Ashrox117> PC is now water cooled
[3:22:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie will never know Revchans love
[3:22:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> he's got more balls than ever, they just put more in
[3:22:22] <%SABiscotti> They were justSaiyan training weights for him?
[3:22:23] <viewtifulr> Balls healed? WHAT BALLS
[3:22:23] <%valriot> OH MAN THEY TOTALLY SET IT UP
[3:22:29] <dauver> SingsNote
[3:22:31] <%Ranryu692> I forgot this ends with a warthog run
[3:22:32] <%justnathan18> Gief has a quad
[3:22:32] <seniormeatbox> main menu theme hell ye
[3:22:38] <KeystoneA2> This soundtrack though
[3:22:42] <%Papa_Bearman> Those pods are all still full, by the way.
[3:22:49] <+trackles_64> Mos timpotant encounter in the game
[3:22:53] <%LumberjackJack> Vigil tiiiiiiiiiime
[3:22:53] <Ashrox117> Gief got the krogan balls syndrome
[3:22:57] <%X2Eliah> @Papa_Bearman full but dead
[3:22:59] <+evbites> @Papa_Bearman with corpeses
[3:22:59] <AngryAsian5> IT'S A TRAP
[3:23:01] <Ipsenscastle> yeah yeah yeah second best bit incoming
[3:23:03] <%LouieRouie> The balls were weighing him down
[3:23:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> I just realized that Wolverine can't get a vasectomy
[3:23:05] <ape_hawk> LOL
[3:23:12] <+trackles_64> ADmiral Ackbar
[3:23:15] <+evbites> @GeneralSCPatton nope
[3:23:16] <thetunnelhomer> Oh yea this part!
[3:23:17] <spongeofmystery> My brother is having this track played at his funeral specifically to fuck with me emotionally
[3:23:26] <%AFellowDegen> @AFellowDegen Even if the player thinks that, Bioware did not think that. She gets the most, time, the most important things, the most development by far
[3:23:32] <SoAndSoap> who put pat in this game?
[3:23:33] <NitronStreams> oh god its worse thana trap... its a elevator
[3:23:36] <%CalderGaming> The Music
[3:23:37] <%dekkitout> @GeneralSCPatton That explains like the 4 kids he has, not counting Laura/Gabi
[3:23:39] <%Papa_Bearman> Hey, Vigil.
[3:23:44] <peachy996> @GeneralSCPatton Wolverine could never be circumcised
[3:23:45] <%LumberjackJack> Ya ready for revelations?
[3:23:46] <jimster40k> VIGIL!!!!
[3:23:47] <%scaryboisupreme> Vigil is so cool
[3:23:47] <stantheman_97> music
[3:23:49] <stormhawk9891> SEIZURE TIME
[3:23:50] <DSD24> God this looks so bad
[3:23:51] <stantheman_97> Kreygasm
[3:23:55] <%scaryboisupreme> Even this soundtrack name is Vigil
[3:23:55] <fugly_nick> Hope nobody here has Epilepsy
[3:23:59] <BenLanBen> let's revel in revelations
[3:23:59] <+even_the_yuenglings> big revelaitons incoming
[3:23:59] <DSD24> Why does it gotta be so bright
[3:24:01] <%Blackleafx> oh my god this guy hurts my eyes so bad
[3:24:01] <%Dakuu75> "VI"?
[3:24:02] <Sp3ctre48> BibleThump
[3:24:03] <thetunnelhomer> Oh hey, an AI helping an Organic. That's neat
[3:24:05] <AngryAsian5> This segment, and the Sovereign segment are so good.
[3:24:07] <+Bogart4321> yo this is actually harsh
[3:24:08] <%ScottishMadJacko> wow that flashing is pretty bad
[3:24:13] <+michingmallecho> Visual interface
[3:24:13] <viewtifulr> Oh i misread that as virgil lytMOTIVATED
[3:24:18] <+ScrapKingKeita> It's VIGIL? The Brother of Date?!
[3:24:19] <%Blackleafx> yeah this is rough
[3:24:23] <%ScottishMadJacko> i dont remember it being this bad on my ps
[3:24:23] <+MightyDuckShoes> @afellowdegen You don't have to fuck her to get that. You can get all of that without most of the weird attachment.
[3:24:25] <Sunstalker> Vigil, show us what prothean titties looked like.
[3:24:28] <+trackles_64> Coolest AI in the game, never appears again
[3:24:31] <dauver> good old eye searing Vigill
[3:24:31] <%justnathan18> I dont understand? Why arent you Jamaican
[3:24:32] <zanzibarian_hamster> HOW
[3:24:35] <%Eilocke> VI Gil
[3:24:35] <DatAsuna> protheans known for their politeness
[3:24:36] <AluxStreams> It's gonna do a close-up of this thing if anybody wants to look away.
[3:24:38] <ZeroWhitewolfx> Tali's voice massively improved in 2
[3:24:38] <ioci2112> @AFellowDegen liara is kinda boring, but she's in all the promotional material, gets her own dlc, gets the most scenes, somebody in bioware really wanted some blussy it seems
[3:24:38] <%Dakuu75> Show me your motivation
[3:24:38] <Jetsfantasy> How convenient
[3:24:44] <+michingmallecho> Now he's motivated
[3:24:45] <Ashrox117> Tali: “Oh hey, wait why can I understand Sheperd and Wrex too ?”
[3:24:47] <KaitlynnHere> Can we kiss?
[3:24:54] <+trackles_64> THE CHOSEN ONE
[3:24:56] <thetunnelhomer> That is 100% AI at this point.
[3:24:56] <peachy996> Don't forget that you can never kill Liara
[3:24:57] <+evbites> @justnathan18 the a.i in 3 isn't jamaican either
[3:24:57] <zanzibarian_hamster> I've never gotten that, how do they know the entire dictionary and grammar from brief conversations?
[3:24:57] <BenLanBen> go to Noveria, he said it'll be safe
[3:24:58] <%justnathan18> Protheans are bugs, would they have titties?
[3:24:58] <%chance_h> Wait so he’s speaking French?
[3:24:58] <$realm_forge> How did Shepard never get indoctrinated over the course of 3 games?
[3:25:00] <Pookiedaexzile> His voice has a lighter version of the same distortion Sovereign has
[3:25:01] <hat_under_bread> I like how the tech is so advanced they can just create a full natural language translation with an hour of samples.
[3:25:02] <KaitlynnHere> So no kiss?
[3:25:04] <%dekkitout> So what's the ruling on consciousness uploads in ME, ai or not ai?
[3:25:04] <fugly_nick> It's so bad
[3:25:10] <DSD24> Its so bad when you are playing the game
[3:25:11] <usuallysleepy> we can see it light up the room like a dance hall LUL
[3:25:13] <%Eilocke> it's already pretty bright. kinda hurting my eyes
[3:25:14] <$Faustgesicht> oof
[3:25:15] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> we can see it reflecting!
[3:25:20] <ape_hawk> hey vigil, how big can a prothean asshole expand?
[3:25:21] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> It's pretty fuckin bright
[3:25:21] <+evbites> @dekkitout not a.i
[3:25:23] <+yashpar> @realm_forge I mean there's fan theories that shep did
[3:25:27] <fugly_nick> And this is a long conversation too
[3:25:29] <Minorou> I had to look away on this guy, even with HDR off
[3:25:29] <%Papa_Bearman> Apparently, every omni-tool is equipped with a universal translator.
[3:25:30] <%Maids4lyfe> @PatStaresAt I saw this on another stream and it nearly caused me to have a seizure
[3:25:32] <%X2Eliah> Yeah it's kinda painfully bright even through twitch
[3:25:36] <%AFellowDegen> @MightyDuckShoes I agree completely. But she is by far the  most prominent and rewarding  romance
[3:25:40] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:25:41] <+trackles_64> Bad boi
[3:25:42] <KaitlynnHere> It’s reflecting on your face
[3:25:45] <%Dakuu75> ASK THE VI PROGRAM IF IT HAS A NIGHT-MODE, PLEASE?!
[3:25:45] <+ThomasOfTroy> We can see the light's reflection freaking out your camera
[3:25:47] <zhenthrim213> to bring the Tyran- wrong franchise
[3:25:48] <zanzibarian_hamster> I'm not epileptic but I sure as fuck am about to be, jesus it's harsh
[3:25:49] <+natedrago> "How does he know!"
[3:25:50] <thetunnelhomer> @Papa_Bearman Translator microbes actually.
[3:25:51] <AluxStreams> Mass relays are super cool.
[3:25:54] <Ashrox117> The citadel will open, and it will be like fall guys up in here
[3:25:59] <KaitlynnHere> BAD
[3:25:59] <+MightyDuckShoes> @afellowdegen What's the reward?
[3:25:59] <+michingmallecho> psaDogchamp
[3:26:01] <thetunnelhomer> Basically a bablefish.
[3:26:02] <%dekkitout> Oh, right Keepers...
[3:26:03] <+Grayhammatter> he do the blep like, "father, i have no idea what you are talking about."
[3:26:03] <%Papa_Bearman> Eh, whatever.
[3:26:06] <KaitlynnHere> BAD DOG
[3:26:10] <+trackles_64> Chorban was right all along
[3:26:13] <Ipsenscastle> the secret is to have a shitty old tv like me
[3:26:15] <awalbaru> the dog is being affected by the lights
[3:26:15] <AluxStreams> Mass relays are just guns that shoot you at FTL speeds.
[3:26:20] <%Papa_Bearman> It's the Google MacGuffin app.
[3:26:24] <%justnathan18> Chorban's ears are ringing
[3:26:31] <KaitlynnHere> that’s KEKW
[3:26:32] <%Papa_Bearman> He explained what the keepers do.
[3:26:33] <%justnathan18> Do Salarians have ears?
[3:26:34] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Damn, this is legit giving me a headache on my HDR monitor
[3:26:35] <hat_under_bread> The Reapers sure understand bureaucracy.
[3:26:35] <filialpails> maybe the vet actually put extra balls in
[3:26:35] <%CalderGaming> Keepers revelation
[3:26:35] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[3:26:38] <%dekkitout> He said the Keepers are in on it
[3:26:38] <tranquilturnip> the keepers are training wheels for understanding the citadel
[3:26:39] <zhenthrim213> were all going to die
[3:26:40] <%justnathan18> He was talking about the Keepers
[3:26:41] <%JamesCorck> Something about a tomato, I dunno.
[3:26:42] <%LaughingCatt> Keepers & Reapers & bears oh my
[3:26:43] <+ThomasOfTroy> tl;dr Keepers exist
[3:26:46] <+Grayhammatter> god, that is so bright
[3:26:51] <thewrathofscience> He said the keepers are bitches
[3:26:55] <KaitlynnHere> @justnathan18 ear holes I think
[3:26:59] <DSD24> Keepers are cute
[3:27:01] <%moonmintparadise> aaaa the flashing is real bad
[3:27:01] <+trackles_64> So this is the Halo part
[3:27:02] <+evbites> @justnathan18 i think the bumps on their head vibrate
[3:27:07] <DSD24> Cute bug doods
[3:27:08] <hat_under_bread> "Maybe we should actually understand this thing we're basing our entire lives around?" "Nah, that would be expensive and it works now."
[3:27:18] <%X2Eliah> So like Mass Relays need a start and an end Relay to function yeah? .... So how does the Normandy get back from the endzone to Omega-4 Relay?
[3:27:20] <peachy996> It's nuts about the Keepers
[3:27:24] <%AFellowDegen> @MightyDuckShoes More screen time/romance time, and the final scene in 3 actually gives a meaning beyond a "I love you" call or conversation
[3:27:28] <AluxStreams> "We gotta go stop Spark from activating the rings."
[3:27:29] <%justnathan18> So Mordin is missing an ear kinda
[3:27:36] <KaitlynnHere> Ahhh we’re fucked!
[3:27:37] <%NateyBeak> omg I cant beleive mass effect ripped off star trek picard
[3:27:38] <+Politepies> ME3 was just like "nah" on this whole lore dump
[3:27:39] <%JamesCorck> Pat, are you saving the Council?
[3:27:42] <+evbites> @X2Eliah light speed
[3:27:43] <Ashrox117> So how do we use the citadel against the reapers? Activate it obviously
[3:27:49] <fugly_nick> @X2Eliah I always wondered this, I don't think there was a relay on the other side
[3:27:54] <Ipsenscastle> 'I am delaying you on your extremely time-sensitive mission to save the galaxy, to tell you how important it is for you to complete your mission in time.'
[3:27:58] <Profmcstevie> Do Reapers do galaxy wide or universe wide annihilation
[3:27:59] <%DizzyGunner> this is where the story gets plot holes, because javik said it went on for centuries.....
[3:28:00] <thetunnelhomer> Oh christ. I forgot Picard ripped off Mass effect super hard.
[3:28:01] <%justnathan18> The Council sucks, but if they die then you lose their cool ass ship
[3:28:03] <Ashrox117> Wait, ME:3 is Halo
[3:28:05] <Sp3ctre48> Sure would be weird if the Reapers chose to not attack the citadel this cycle for some reason
[3:28:07] <Tracazoid> "I'm sure one of you are alive if I pay someone enough."
[3:28:10] <awalbaru> monkaW
[3:28:11] <+evbites> @Profmcstevie galaxy
[3:28:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Look at all this shit that gets thrown out
[3:28:17] <awalbaru> they dominated their Facebook
[3:28:17] <+CherteuseKapibara> they leaked all their nudes
[3:28:29] <%X2Eliah> @X2Eliah There wasn't, I did that mission again yesterday. No Relay on the other side of O-4
[3:28:30] <tigo0donnell> @profmcstevie Galaxy wide, they aren’t in Andromeda
[3:28:35] <%Dakuu75> "Hey guys, I got an idea for this A.I program... let's make it really bright AND... flashing", Sounds good.\
[3:28:37] <TheMostAverageGamer4> so collecters now right
[3:28:37] <%DizzyGunner> literally everything vigil says gets retconned
[3:28:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Kappa Kappa Kappa
[3:28:41] <+holyxgrale> This guy is seizure inducing without hdr
[3:28:44] <ape_hawk> because CoD
[3:28:46] <+Desthanos> This kind of goes against the whole crucible thing from ME3 where they somehow were able to build it despite their leadership effectively dead before they even knew it happened.
[3:28:47] <AngryAsian5> Plot reasons
[3:28:48] <+freakfullmetal2> because bad writing lol
[3:28:49] <Ipsenscastle> mass relays
[3:28:49] <%valriot> FOUGHT for Hundreds of year
[3:28:51] <%scaryboisupreme> cause they get better at it each time
[3:28:51] <%AzureGale> They got impatient
[3:28:51] <+trackles_64> game logi
[3:28:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Because fuck you and your Story
[3:28:52] <+yashpar> Protheans were more prepared I guess
[3:28:52] <DSD24> For the stakes Pat
[3:28:52] <$Futurecity10> Protheans have thousands of worlds
[3:28:52] <DatAsuna> 3 takes longer than it looks
[3:28:52] <peachy996> Enslaved so they set up the Collectors
[3:28:53] <TioXyco> they were already here
[3:28:54] <JetpackMcQuack> don't think about that
[3:28:54] <Profmcstevie> Maybe we should tell the Reapers about the other billions of galaxies then
[3:28:55] <KaitlynnHere> Wait so no alien race knew where the citadel came from and they were like “eh, oh well. Let’s put our leaders here, there’s really nice offices”
[3:28:55] <heartlesshealer> because writing
[3:28:55] <TheSaltminer> see ME2 DLC for details
[3:28:56] <Ashrox117> After the Protheans were demonetized, it was basically over
[3:28:56] <logothete2401> Because the Protheans were actually competent
[3:28:57] <+Ropcord> hundreds of years to clean up, not to cripple them
[3:28:57] <+YabbaTroll> cause the council is incompetent
[3:28:58] <thetunnelhomer> Because Mac Walters
[3:28:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> because it wouldn't fit into a game
[3:28:59] <%OldOnyx> practice?
[3:28:59] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> because this is cool scifi and cool scifi is not bigbux
[3:29:00] <%Nuclearcherries> Experiene
[3:29:00] <+D00msDayDan> cause we suck
[3:29:00] <AluxStreams> I guess 3 takes place over the course of years?
[3:29:01] <%LaughingCatt> Because 3 be messy
[3:29:01] <$Solid_Stro> Because we suck
[3:29:01] <%castlerock42> Protheans were unified. It was trillions fighting as one.
[3:29:02] <%Papa_Bearman> They had to take the long way to the planets, so they had time to think about it?
[3:29:02] <ZeroWhitewolfx> Protheans were more advanced
[3:29:02] <Sp3ctre48> Cause the Protheans were united and basically ruled the galaxy at the time, our cycle sucks in comparison
[3:29:03] <seniormeatbox> protheans were stronger
[3:29:03] <+evbites> @PatStaresAt it was only the begining
[3:29:05] <%AFellowDegen> They say in 3 that it will take hundreds of years for it to finish
[3:29:06] <ammobasket> they got better at it?
[3:29:09] <%CalderGaming> the protheans conquered all the other spacefaring civs, didn't they? bigger reach?
[3:29:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Proteans had a much larger empire
[3:29:14] <tigo0donnell> @dizzygunner Nah, as Javik just said, it took centuries
[3:29:15] <%ScottishMadJacko> protheans were the ruler of the galaxy, current galaxy is divided amongst various races
[3:29:15] <%knight1210> Protheans were better
[3:29:16] <+even_the_yuenglings> protheans were united
[3:29:17] <Mattais88> When you do the same thing 1000 times, you gotta spice it up. Speedruns, pistol only, etc.
[3:29:20] <Deasmeister> 100s to wipe out all life
[3:29:21] <ioci2112> hundreds of years to wipe all of inteligent life, not to cripple the galaxy
[3:29:23] <+ryuguitarfreak> We became space man-bugs
[3:29:26] <JetpackMcQuack> earth goes first shut up
[3:29:28] <aiutare47> Batarians fucked up, and Protheans were way way stronger
[3:29:30] <Ashrox117> Target their ad revenue
[3:29:33] <$Solid_Stro> The Reapers took all our porn WutFace
[3:29:33] <+evbites> @AluxStreams i think every game is a couple months
[3:29:36] <dauver> there is a potential large amount of time between failure in 3 and total wipe of existing species
[3:29:40] <stantheman_97> probably because you're only seen prominent planets that they attack first
[3:29:41] <%knight1210> Protheans were one empire
[3:29:43] <%QueequegTheater> It gets their dicks hard
[3:29:46] <%CalderGaming> WHY INDEED.
[3:29:47] <ScreamLord> @afronooch Because the Prothean Empire was bigger and better than our cycle
[3:29:48] <fugly_nick> For the lulz
[3:29:48] <%Papa_Bearman> It's how they fuck.
[3:29:49] <JetpackMcQuack> CoolStoryBob
[3:29:53] <Sp3ctre48> Don't ask that Shepard, it has a really stupid answer
[3:29:58] <+MightyDuckShoes> @afellowdegen Yeah, so. Just more. Bioware could have gone another way. Made Ashley have all that screen time and attention. Maybe make Liara a character you can sacrifice. Would you suggest people should go for an Ashley romance through three games in that situation? I wouldn't personally take that option if the "more" less valuable to me than the "what."
[3:29:58] <KeystoneA2> "Don't worry some Star Child brat will explain it to you in 3 years, Shep"
[3:29:59] <%valriot> Reapers aim for the homeworlds first, but it would take a long time to actually get everyone in the galaxy, hence why youre even capable of doing anything in ME3, space is big
[3:30:02] <%bassoontyphoon> I mean the invasion in 3 was attacking big hubs/worlds. The 100 years thing is for the systematic genocide of all the other worlds
[3:30:03] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Because the Prothean Empire was bigger and better than our cycle
[3:30:04] <spike_j_wolfwood> they thought it would be funny
[3:30:04] <Drunkengen> their motives are COMPLEX
[3:30:05] <thetunnelhomer> Turns out their motives are REALLY DUMB
[3:30:05] <tigo0donnell> Liara mentions it’ll take at least over a century of near total genocide
[3:30:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Alien, Unknowable, Giant Cenobites.....or
[3:30:09] <Ashrox117> Have you seen Dexter? Yeah, like that
[3:30:13] <KaitlynnHere> Cause it gets their rocks off
[3:30:14] <fugly_nick> "For the lulz" is unironically a better answer than the real thing
[3:30:16] <zanzibarian_hamster> COMPLEX MOTIVES
[3:30:19] <%DizzyGunner> let's just say you can tell they didn't plan the story out because after 3 none of this makes sense
[3:30:22] <ioci2112> and considering in me3 the only way to get to the citadel (where they are processing all the people) is one single laser in london, I'm wondering if the reapers don't have more efficient methods for mass murder, it would take years to get everyone like that
[3:30:36] <badguy8312> Its just how they shoot their goo
[3:30:38] <+Ropcord> drive ur car into it lol
[3:30:39] <$Solid_Stro> The Reapers must be... Controlled doodBait
[3:30:43] <generalve> @patstaresat the entire protheon backstory is just so fucking depressing
[3:30:45] <seniormeatbox> @DizzyGunner no the plan was dark energy and that got set up in 2 but people on reddit found out about it
[3:30:53] <+evbites> @Solid_Stro no destroy
[3:30:59] <tigo0donnell> You can kinda tell the Reapers were never meant to have a reason for the Reapers
[3:31:07] <peachy996> Yeah the way these people die is pretty sad
[3:31:08] <%valriot> @DizzyGunner Its 100% makes sense, i dont think you realise how BIG space is, full systematic genocide would take a long time, it would start out massive and dwindle down

[3:32:03] <badguy8312> @fugly_nick less goooo
[3:32:07] <awalbaru> is how he reproduces
[3:32:09] <tigo0donnell> @seniormeatbox The dark energy subplot never was finalized, Drew K confirmed that himself. It was just one of the main ideas that was going for 3. From what I know, The plot that did leak for ME3 apparently didn’t have anything to do with it.
[3:32:14] <Ipsenscastle> nasty doglet
[3:32:17] <%Papa_Bearman> Somebody blows their nose and you wanna keep it?
[3:32:26] <%walternatorz> imagine how he feels. now he can't get pat taste out of his mouth
[3:32:26] <%Mekhet09> The only thing I think that doesn't make sense is do the reapers restore non-renewable resources? Like how can millions of civilizations just do this without it.

[3:34:22] <+ThomasOfTroy> @Mekhet09 There are 100 thousand million stars in our galaxy, and they're only genociding the advanced species. They don't need to restore resources, since there's just so fucking much of it already

[3:38:08] <+Afterman_> I havent played Mass effect since i beat 3. is the LE worth buying? @PatStaresAt
[3:38:09] <%chance_h> Humans are genetically designed to lose muscle mass constantly. Most animals will just grow into their normal muscle swollness without effort.

[3:38:32] <%Papa_Bearman> Yeah, you dumb fuck, he explained that to you.
[3:38:32] <%X2Eliah> Like Vigil was flickery and werid in the original ME1 but it is more painful to look at in the LE
[3:38:37] <%dekkitout> Theyre not ants Pat
[3:38:41] <hat_under_bread> Or they could just use clones? I don't think that's harder than making a mass relay.

[3:39:09] <JetpackMcQuack> uh oh
[3:39:11] <@SSaryn> I will be the one to do it. ME.
[3:39:24] <hat_under_bread> But whatever. Plot is plot.
[3:39:24] <+Grayhammatter> OH GOD
[3:39:32] <Ashrox117> Protheans shoulda maybe invested in solar
[3:39:33] <%DizzyGunner> @PatStaresAt did you see what they where going to make the protheans look like from the tentacle statues?
[3:39:39] <%Maids4lyfe> take a pamphlet
[3:39:41] <tigo0donnell> @dekkitout They can live and dark and move from cluster to cluster without Mass Relays
[3:39:41] <generalve> @patstaresat Vigil is giving massive epileptic lights RuleFive
[3:39:41] <peachy996> But can't Star Child just activate the Reapers itself
[3:39:51] <spongeofmystery> 50,000 year old DDoS
[3:39:51] <peachy996> God I hate ME3 Starchild
[3:39:53] <i_chevalier> no one in mass effect seems worth saving though.
[3:39:54] <+Politepies> ME3 just...
[3:40:14] <%Maids4lyfe> Anderson was worth saving
[3:40:17] <%Papa_Bearman> But where the hell did Sovereign hide?!
[3:40:23] <Ipsenscastle> 'I have distracted you from following Sarenin order to tell you to follow Saren'
[3:40:23] <%Maids4lyfe> he punched Udina
[3:40:23] <badguy8312> @i_chevalier what about the Elcor?
[3:40:24] <%justnathan18> Joker is worth saving.
[3:40:26] <+pmtriox> this game only has 1 game in its franchise
[3:40:32] <Clundy> That’s no moon
[3:40:32] <%DizzyGunner> so sovereign uses tech AND biotics? Kappa
[3:40:32] <%justnathan18> and Chakwas
[3:40:38] <+evbites> @Papa_Bearman just drifting in the outer realm
[3:40:39] <dauver> it is kind of funny how all we do in ME 1 and 2 is buying time to prepare for the invasion but most of the galaxy just wastes most of this prep time
[3:40:42] <%QueequegTheater> @Papa_Bearman Galaxy's big
[3:40:42] <%Papa_Bearman> How the fuck did Sovereign hide, though?!?
[3:40:47] <%X2Eliah> @Papa_Bearman in Dis. There's some thought that Sovereign was "the leviathan of Dis"
[3:40:52] <%X2Eliah> I forget which star system it was
[3:40:59] <+Peacefrog7> God isn't vigil and its score just the greatest
[3:41:02] <%QueequegTheater> @Papa_Bearman galaxy is big
[3:41:08] <spongeofmystery> "united"
[3:41:10] <i_chevalier> 2% of 98% of the galaxy
[3:41:12] <+evbites> @Papa_Bearman cloke tech
[3:41:23] <ape_hawk> lol not rushing into the unknown
[3:41:30] <%invalid_robin> Vigil sounds like a much more calm Limbic System
[3:41:31] <KeystoneA2> It's implied Sovereign caused the Rachni Wars
[3:41:34] <%Papa_Bearman> Hiding under a really big blanket?
[3:41:35] <%justnathan18> How many Space Asset Points has Pat missed in ME3 already?
[3:41:44] <+Peacefrog7> yeah
[3:41:50] <DSD24> Confidence is a slow and insidious killer
[3:41:53] <%VHGS> It's not really that hard to hide in space.
[3:41:53] <+Peacefrog7> sovereign is the best
[3:42:03] <tigo0donnell> @dauver That’s one of the biggest problems with 2 in the sense of the trilogy as a whole. We roughly end up at the same spot we do at the end of 1. The Reapers are still coming and we need to know how to stop them
[3:42:03] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> this is so cool that it just makes me sadder about the other games
[3:42:05] <DSD24> Shit I mean Overconfidence
[3:42:05] <Hillthugsta> @papa_bearman Unknown Solar systems? "between stars" as Legon put it.
[3:42:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Space Net
[3:42:15] <peachy996> Good thing those are the only beacons
[3:42:18] <i_chevalier> @dsd24 so is Patience
[3:42:21] <+Pequod1> Oh shit best OST in game
[3:42:27] <buerdo> 5g
[3:42:30] <spongeofmystery> @Whiskey_T_Foxtrot limesFeels
[3:42:31] <peachy996> Not like there's a Beacon on Thessia or anything....
[3:42:33] <Hillthugsta> @papa_bearman Space is vast
[3:42:36] <%Mr_Pylon> oh so Shepard got an NFT from the beacon
[3:42:47] <+Peacefrog7> who did pat sacrifice chat?
[3:42:49] <%Maids4lyfe> more like 6g
[3:42:50] <+evbites> @tigo0donnell well we stop the creation of a human reaper it's not she's fault the council is incompetent
[3:42:52] <%Papa_Bearman> Yup, and he could only see it once.
[3:42:58] <%Papa_Bearman> Sacrificed Ashley.
[3:43:02] <fugly_nick> He sacrificed Ashley
[3:43:03] <Phoenix_gryph0n> Vibin with this OST
[3:43:03] <+evbites> @Peacefrog7 ash
[3:43:06] <+D00msDayDan> shepard confirmed for not a reaper
[3:43:06] <AluxStreams> @Peacefrog7 Ash is ash.
[3:43:19] <%Papa_Bearman> And now we're gonna sacrifice Liara because we banged her so she's useless now.
[3:43:19] <+Peacefrog7> nice 👌
[3:43:33] <dd44dostivei> what a strangely ponderous VI
[3:43:41] <tattleworm> oh sick, reave vanguard in me3 is still a possibility
[3:43:53] <+pmtriox> you mean the retconned plotpoint in 3?
[3:43:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> The Keeper situation reminds me of that thing that happens near the end of Xenoblade Chronicles.
[3:44:01] <tigo0donnell> @evbites True enough. Still I do wish 2 ended with something more important for 3. Like what if the end of 2 had us find the Crucible and Javik instead of it being on Mars and Eden Prime in 3.
[3:44:01] <Phoenix_gryph0n> Da geth
[3:44:10] <+Grayhammatter> da geth
[3:44:13] <%Papa_Bearman> I love geth chicks.
[3:44:14] <Hillthugsta> Reave is op
[3:44:22] <+evbites> @tigo0donnell theres the arrival dlc
[3:44:29] <+Peacefrog7> OST IS OP
[3:44:30] <Wolfstriker121> reave is legit fucking op
[3:44:41] <+liquidzr0> @Papa_Bearman adumBooty
[3:44:58] <otakon17> surprised no one found the Prothean remains
[3:45:00] <%QueequegTheater> Reave is OP
[3:45:00] <%ScottishMadJacko> its a biotic move
[3:45:01] <TioXyco> greatest civilization to ever live on space. stupid enough to not make a way back
[3:45:01] <AluxStreams> Biotic power in ME3?
[3:45:01] <+even_the_yuenglings> reave is a good power
[3:45:02] <%Papa_Bearman> Reave.  It's an ability in ME2.
[3:45:03] <+pmtriox> powerful ability
[3:45:04] <%ScottishMadJacko> reave
[3:45:04] <%X2Eliah> Reave is an ME3 skill
[3:45:04] <+Grayhammatter> JESUS
[3:45:04] <peachy996> Reave is a Biotic Ability
[3:45:06] <pilllowofbees> got eaten by keepers probably
[3:45:07] <otakon17> Reave is a bonus power in ME3
[3:45:07] <dauver> @tigo0donnell  arrival DLC lets us blow up a relay to buy more time at least, thats something
[3:45:09] <otakon17> ME2*
[3:45:09] <usuallysleepy> omg lmao
[3:45:11] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> wow
[3:45:11] <stormhawk9891> IT'S SO BAD
[3:45:11] <badguy8312> its called reave
[3:45:12] <+evbites> in fact that's what shep is being court-martialed for
[3:45:12] <+Ropcord> RIP eyes
[3:45:14] <tattleworm> reave is a skill you learn from kaiden in me3 that pairs incredibly with vanguards
[3:45:16] <otakon17> Reave is basically BETTER Warp
[3:45:16] <%moonmintparadise> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[3:45:19] <Wolfstriker121> the ability pat reave
[3:45:20] <AluxStreams> One last effort to kill the player.
[3:45:22] <Phoenix_gryph0n> To be fair, I never played ME3 mossyWut
[3:45:22] <+Grayhammatter> it's so bad
[3:45:22] <+holyxgrale> Yea seeing new people place this part and becoming blind was hilarious
[3:45:23] <Profmcstevie> Cinematography is my PASSION
[3:45:23] <%JoshManVGH> Wow so Quarians and Reapers share a common element: They both prefer the Geth to be mindless slave toasters.
[3:45:28] <%Arweynn> what is gief doing?
[3:45:29] <Phoenix_gryph0n> WTF was that camera mossyLaugh
[3:45:31] <Phoenix_gryph0n> JESUS

[3:45:36] <jorniev> so whats happening now? I lost my internet a while back
[3:45:36] <Phoenix_gryph0n> that was an epilepsy weapon
[3:45:36] <%X2Eliah> Oh god I can barely see anything now that its all dark
[3:45:37] <%Papa_Bearman> I'm glad I don't suffer from epilepsy.
[3:45:42] <%Papa_Bearman> Gief's just being a happy puppo.
[3:45:43] <fugly_nick> Seizure time over
[3:45:44] <Hillthugsta> but what was more OP? ME2 REAVE or ME3 REAVE?
[3:45:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Reaver? I know you could fuck a Reaper
[3:45:48] <+evbites> @JoshManVGH i prefer the geth to be that
[3:45:48] <%Mr_Pylon> I don't remember, does anyone go back and talk to that AI again?
[3:45:52] <+holyxgrale> Yeah well your people weren't enslaving the reapers
[3:45:53] <%Maids4lyfe> shut up tali you did it to yourselves

[3:46:11] <peachy996> I imagine anyone in Chat that knows nothing about Mass Effect are incredibly confused about the rest of Chat talking about ME2 and ME3 so casually
[3:46:12] <%walternatorz> he's just a big black blob
[3:46:13] <%Papa_Bearman> He's just being a happy puppo.

[3:47:51] <%Papa_Bearman> YET.
[3:47:52] <%justnathan18> Halo would be cooler with squad mates and customization.
[3:47:54] <+evbites> Mako or warthog?
[3:47:57] <feralspidey> "I'm not your friend, buddy!!"
[3:47:58] <AluxStreams> Copy that Echo 4-19. We've got a wildcat destabilization in the engines. Requesting immediate evac.

[3:48:26] <+evbites> @HaroldDonchee get so wet she drowns in her suit
[3:48:27] <spongeofmystery> Tali would legit call Geth "Lampshades"
[3:48:27] <%SveriSageAdvice> @justnathan18 we got that, Halo Reach
[3:48:32] <%Ranryu692> the Mako's better, but I have more love for the Pum- I mean Warthog
[3:48:32] <ioci2112> remember kids, racism is ok as long as you have a nice butt and a cute accent
[3:48:40] <BenLanBen> geth them
[3:48:40] <+TrevSmith222> Around this time, most geth are pretty dumb anyway.
[3:48:44] <%Papa_Bearman> That alone got your 54,000 creds?!
[3:48:45] <%QueequegTheater> It's also not nearly as cool as the final Warthog run
[3:48:45] <zhukis> Why did hte pc port in the original ruin this?
[3:48:53] <+evbites> @ioci2112 also, if it's against dumb robotd
[3:48:54] <%Papa_Bearman> Money means NOTHING in this game.

[3:52:10] <+evbites> @ryuguitarfreak let them die also asari are terrible
[3:52:10] <stantheman_97> weird how the geth only used humans as husks here
[3:52:10] <%Monkeyweed21> damn I missed Elos and Virmire

[3:52:16] <+idyota> D:
[3:52:17] <signofzeta> love this part
[3:52:17] <%Papa_Bearman> It's a glitch in the console version where the Mako loses it shields as you get down the hill, and the Geth Colossi just destroy you.
[3:52:19] <%valriot> D: the bug men
[3:52:19] <awalbaru> WHy Saren why
[3:52:19] <%Nuclearcherries> This one slaps
[3:52:20] <%MidnightBurst12> wow rude
[3:52:21] <Pookiedaexzile> They do it better in two
[3:52:22] <jorniev> poor civilians
[3:52:24] <+evbites> but why?
[3:52:24] <Hillthugsta> @screamlord I know, right? That bugs me to this day
[3:52:26] <+TrevSmith222> The fuck did the keepers do?  lol
[3:52:27] <TheSaltminer> that's because this game was developed as an RPG first and a shooting game second
[3:52:28] <Phoenix_gryph0n> D:
[3:52:29] <%X2Eliah> Guys relax Pat only uses barrier
[3:52:30] <%dekkitout> Why bully the keepers
[3:52:32] <%DizzyGunner> like what's the point in have cool as aliens in your game if the main character is a boring ass human
[3:52:32] <dauver> wait, was Saren the og Marauder Shields?
[3:52:33] <BlockingDisabled> You're getting like an entire average persons yearly income from killing a single husk
[3:52:35] <LluthyY> poor keeper...
[3:52:37] <ScreamLord> Please do not disturb the Keepers
[3:52:44] <+even_the_yuenglings> asari ships are cool
[3:52:46] <ZeroWhitewolfx> I like how soveriegn is acting thorugh Saren in that scene, he is pissed that the keeprs didnt listen to him.
[3:52:47] <%zyberion626> yeah those are turian
[3:52:47] <+TrevSmith222> Yeah, I love Tourian ships.
[3:52:49] <HaroldDonchee> FIRE EVERYTHING
[3:52:49] <KeystoneA2> MOVE BITCH
[3:52:50] <DatAsuna> those bridge shots are so star trek too
[3:52:50] <%Ranryu692> I can see how it shares design origins with the Normandy
[3:52:50] <iosephe> It even looks like the Normandy
[3:52:51] <%JamesCorck> They look like weird guns.
[3:52:52] <%Papa_Bearman> Pat, the Normandy is of turian design.
[3:52:53] <+even_the_yuenglings> MOVE BITCH
[3:52:55] <%QueequegTheater> I can't believe they stole the Atlas airships from RWBY for Mass Effect Kappa
[3:52:55] <Hillthugsta> @dauver ...yes
[3:52:56] <%zyberion626> Honk
[3:52:57] <%Varlinator> Hard to starboard!

[3:52:59] <+vaderxyz1970> Yeet
[3:52:59] <%ArcanumArcanum> yeah all turian ships are angular. It's why Normandy has some good angles on it
[3:53:00] <$KnightAsteran> that ship just got vibe checked
[3:53:00] <%ScottishMadJacko> doesnt even care
[3:53:00] <+Ghufufin> turian ships are basically space sword ships
[3:53:00] <%JamesCorck> The Turian ships look like weird guns.
[3:53:03] <%moonmintparadise> IT JUST FUCKING RAMS THEM
[3:53:03] <+evbites> bitches

[3:53:08] <%miguelrod777> I love how it just moved through it
[3:53:08] <spongeofmystery> It coming through the nebula fog like that is just *chef's kiss
[3:53:08] <AngryAsian5> That's such a good visual
[3:53:09] <awalbaru> monkaS
[3:53:13] <i_chevalier> Don't worry we just have to wait until the Enterprise shows up. lol
[3:53:16] <+D00msDayDan> get out the way bitch, get out the way
[3:53:16] <%Order_of_Mystery> that shot looks so much better and menacing
[3:53:19] <hat_under_bread> The Reaper design is so good.
[3:53:19] <+pmtriox> oh wait none of this makes any sense because the Citadel is alive
[3:53:20] <Ipsenscastle> musiccccc
[3:53:20] <JetpackMcQuack> That's the shot
[3:53:21] <%Retinolgaming> Its crackling with sexual energy

[3:53:30] <Hillthugsta> RAMMING SPEED BabyRage
[3:53:30] <%JamesCorck> God, this game is so good.
[3:53:34] <dd44dostivei> KINO
[3:53:34] <+aartbastiaan> it's bizarre that the Citadel is only like 12km wide
[3:53:34] <+vaderxyz1970> Look how big the arms are compared to sovereign
[3:53:35] <%Varlinator> Love the music here
[3:53:39] <AngryAsian5> It's mating with the Citadel
[3:53:39] <tigo0donnell> Such an incredible moment
[3:53:39] <zhukis> Oh no, it's mating with the citadel
[3:53:41] <blue8moon> what in the fuck is happeneing?
[3:53:41] <+evbites> is this sex?
[3:53:41] <%caramelatte1> oh god its mating
[3:53:43] <%DizzyGunner> when you see a reaper compared to the citadel makes you realise how big it is
[3:53:43] <badguy8312> "docking" gross
[3:53:43] <+nazzynoeyes> SPACE PRAWN
[3:53:44] <+even_the_yuenglings> THIS PART IS SICK
[3:53:46] <HaroldDonchee> this is what it was like with Liara and shepherd
[3:53:46] <$realm_forge> And the soundtrack goes full dark synth out of nowhere!
[3:53:47] <%ScottishMadJacko> i always thought reapers looked like giant hands with fingeers
[3:53:50] <+SlagChambers> Man I hated this part when I first played this
[3:53:51] <%Papa_Bearman> I'll shoot it in the face until it stops.
[3:53:52] <Phoenix_gryph0n> ooooh nooooo mossyWut
[3:53:53] <$Solid_Stro> Ram them with the ship!!! It’s the only option!!!
[3:53:56] <SaltyAzteca> YEYEYEYE I REMEMBER THIS
[3:53:57] <KeystoneA2> Saying "Suit up" to Tali is a bit redundant
[3:54:00] <AluxStreams> Tali is already suited up.
[3:54:02] <awalbaru> OH THIS PART
[3:54:02] <DSD24> Isn't saying suit up to Tali kinda silly
[3:54:03] <Ashrox117> Time to stickbug lol until I get destroyed by a tiny ship
[3:54:05] <%justnathan18> Why the fuck would anyone live on the Citadel after this?
[3:54:06] <Phoenix_gryph0n> YEYEYEYE
[3:54:07] <+evbites> magnet boots
[3:54:09] <%Papa_Bearman> "I am stepping outside."  "...Wait, wha--YOU'RE GOING OUTSIDE?!?"
[3:54:10] <peachy996> Biotics, you won't regret it

[3:54:21] <+aartbastiaan> this part is cool
[3:54:23] <hat_under_bread> This is where the budget went.
[3:54:23] <+DarkestVegemite> good thing you brought mag boots
[3:54:24] <+spartanghost004> oh shit I missed the space sex
[3:54:26] <spongeofmystery> Hell of a visual
[3:54:26] <%justnathan18> Telling Tali to suit up might even be considered racist lol
[3:54:29] <$Solid_Stro> @justnathan18 Cost of living... doodDerp
[3:54:35] <fugly_nick> I forgot you can see Soverign on this part
[3:54:35] <+evbites> in zero g

[3:54:38] <Hillthugsta> @justnathan18 Why not?
[3:54:45] <+pmtriox> thats sovereign not saren
[3:54:45] <+aartbastiaan> @justnathan18 people lived in NYC after 9/11
[3:54:47] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> My name is Commander Shepard, and this is my favorite reaper on the citadel.
[3:54:47] <olaksi> is it tapping its finger
[3:54:48] <%X2Eliah> Sovereign just keeps tapping his finger in impatience
[3:54:50] <+spartanghost004> Sovereign you dingus
[3:54:51] <+michingmallecho> this is the part where I got lost
[3:54:52] <%Ranryu692> but in terms of Effect? You have him beat
[3:54:55] <%Monkeyweed21> IM CASTER TROY AND THIS IS MY FAVORITE SHOP ON THE CITADEL
[3:54:55] <%dekkitout> Gonna suplex the space squid?
[3:55:00] <$realm_forge> Time to shoot the mr handicap god squid!
[3:55:04] <%walternatorz> he's just as very large cuttlefish
[3:55:07] <Phoenix_gryph0n> Lmao
[3:55:09] <tanarath> @justnathan18 because either council still doesn't take this seriously & wave it away as Saren trying to take over the galaxy.
[3:55:11] <peachy996> Pat use Lift
[3:55:12] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt Pat, Lift and Throw RULE in this section
[3:55:12] <+vaderxyz1970> Is sovereign the biggest  reaper or was that Hyperion?
[3:55:12] <$realm_forge> Mechanical
[3:55:18] <dauver> geth were cool from the start tho
[3:55:19] <%ScottishMadJacko> yeahhhh
[3:55:20] <peachy996> Lift anyone
[3:55:20] <%Monkeyweed21> shouldnt the corpses fall off?
[3:55:22] <+evbites> holy shit vanguard is busted
[3:55:23] <%DizzyGunner> would of be cool if they gave me1 me2s combat syste,
[3:55:24] <%Papa_Bearman> You're just an unthinkable demigod that no sentient being could possibly comprehend, whereas I nutted to Lara Croft porn this morning before going to the grocery store.  You do not stand a chance, sir.
[3:55:24] <%Dfreddy8> CRAB PEOPLE
[3:55:26] <+even_the_yuenglings> getting the primes on your side in 3 is sick
[3:55:29] <fugly_nick> I think they say Soverign was one of the smaller ones
[3:55:33] <tigo0donnell> @vaderxyz1970 Harbinger is the biggest and oldest
[3:55:35] <$Solid_Stro> I’m cool! You’re not cool!
[3:55:38] <i_chevalier> @tanarath they probably think this all fake news. lol
[3:55:42] <Ashrox117> Wow that guy took 3 shotgun
[3:55:42] <%ScottishMadJacko> doing it to charging krogan or destroyers if my fave
[3:55:42] <otakon17> I love that Lift and Throw and Singularity work in ME1 like they do
[3:55:44] <peachy996> They just fly away if nothing keeps them there
[3:55:46] <awalbaru> LUL
[3:55:51] <%justnathan18> I guess the citadel doesnt get fucked up in 2...that I remember
[3:55:55] <Phoenix_gryph0n> HAHAHAHA
[3:55:58] <stantheman_97> LUL
[3:56:01] <peachy996> YEAH

[3:56:03] <awalbaru> actually Jedi LUL
[3:56:04] <+evbites> @justnathan18 it does in 3
[3:56:05] <$realm_forge> How is Shep not feeling the indoctrination signal this close?
[3:56:06] <otakon17> you don't have to strip protections for them to have an effect
[3:56:08] <ZeroWhitewolfx> LUL
[3:56:08] <seniormeatbox> THIS IS MASS EFFECT
[3:56:08] <Phoenix_gryph0n> LUL mossyLaugh LUL This is a gem
[3:56:09] <%Monkeyweed21> @fugly_nick sovereign is a scout intended to set up the mass relay at the citadel for the others
[3:56:11] <Ranger747> RUDE
[3:56:11] <otakon17> a MASS effect :P
[3:56:16] <tigo0donnell> I do miss the way biotic worked in this game at times
[3:56:18] <%Varlinator> No gravity bitches! LUL
[3:56:23] <danraven> they fly now
[3:56:24] <KeystoneA2> @realm_forge It hits you over time, not all at once
[3:56:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> the range on that shotgun is actually nuts
[3:56:29] <+even_the_yuenglings> I use powers way more than guns when I play
[3:56:30] <%Varlinator> I guess the Geth don't have Magfeet
[3:56:31] <Alzero83> Now This is Pod Racing
[3:56:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This looks like the Shadow Broker ship
[3:56:32] <Ipsenscastle> I love the physics biotics in zero g
[3:56:32] <Ranger747> This skybox rules
[3:56:33] <tanarath> @realm_forge good question
[3:56:35] <%ArcanumArcanum> @realm_forge he probably is feeling the signal, but for indocrtination to take effect it requires prolonged exposure
[3:56:37] <+unhuggable1> what difficulty is this
[3:56:47] <+evbites> @unhuggable1 normal
[3:56:48] <VirtuallyCanadian> We live in a Citadel
[3:56:53] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> a brisk jaunt
[3:56:53] <%Ranryu692> LUL
[3:56:57] <feralspidey> like an ant
[3:57:01] <i_chevalier> @arcanumarcanum He is using the power of Will.

[3:57:26] <SaltyAzteca> NUMBER OF GETH DRASTIC GO DOWN
[3:57:26] <seniormeatbox> shot both wrex and tali
[3:57:26] <Pookiedaexzile> Human Cheesing
[3:57:27] <Ashrox117> Activate the Dark Geth Troopers
[3:57:29] <Profmcstevie> Like being the enemy of the Hulk, boys just HOLDING FORWARD
[3:57:30] <+evbites> sheperd confimed better then doom guy
[3:57:34] <otakon17> as for why Shep is immune to indoctrination, he's not BUT he's not around Sovereign long enough for it to really start taking effect
[3:57:38] <Jetsfantasy> 1000 degree hot Shepard through butter Geth Shock Troopers
[3:57:53] <%Papa_Bearman> But seriously though, Pat, the TMP isn't that bad.
[3:58:00] <+CherteuseKapibara> refreshing

[3:58:08] <+evbites> @otakon17 also shep's will is too strong
[3:58:10] <fugly_nick> The TMP is amazing
[3:58:12] <%Monkeyweed21> yea proper indoctrination can take weeks of exposure to reaper tech
[3:58:16] <spongeofmystery> Dear lord facing Shepard like this would be terrfiying
[3:58:18] <%Varlinator> Barrier TOO OP
[3:58:19] <+spartanghost004> Yeah this was the best mass effect
[3:58:22] <awalbaru> The only kind of man that can save the galaxy monkaS
[3:58:27] <LluthyY> barrier is broken, i love it lol
[3:58:29] <%justnathan18> God, I want us to get to 1.5k before the end.
[3:58:32] <feralspidey> Like doom Slayer fighting the Covenant, Borg and Frieza Force COMBINED
[3:58:32] <%DizzyGunner> and you call tali racist....
[3:58:36] <Basch71> considering shepard can mildly resist morinth's mind control
[3:58:38] <+even_the_yuenglings> tali getting turned on by you mercilessly slaughtering toasters
[3:58:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Toaster ass bitch
[3:58:38] <$Solid_Stro> I’m the Juggernaut BITCH!!! coxRee
[3:58:39] <stantheman_97> imagine saren seeing you take four rockets in the face with just some scratches

[3:58:45] <ZeroWhitewolfx> LUL
[3:58:46] <+evbites> @AluxStreams Saren: ha i wi..Oh wow he is just going.
[3:58:46] <otakon17> Legion doesn't like these Geth
[3:58:47] <Nautilaa> what class is this
[3:58:49] <+vaderxyz1970> their Alexa controlled toasters
[3:58:50] <dauver> imagine if 4 just retcons endings of 3 entirely
[3:58:51] <otakon17> they're Heretics
[3:58:55] <+aartbastiaan> tmp sucks
[3:58:58] <Ashrox117> Sovereign going, “So does this guy have any family bc this ain’t working”
[3:59:01] <%Varlinator> Tali's dead btw
[3:59:01] <ZeroWhitewolfx> There is a good reason why he likes wearing your armor LUL
[3:59:02] <+spartanghost004> oh wow tali is down
[3:59:03] <dd44dostivei> this music reminds me of those infinitely scaling notes
[3:59:04] <DSD24> Is Tali dead
[3:59:05] <otakon17> @Nautilaa Vanguard
[3:59:11] <PirateMike_> Shepard Commander.
[3:59:12] <+evbites> this is where shep became a legend
[3:59:13] <%justnathan18> I bet Saren is just thinking this entire time "This motherfucker AGAIN! Hes been on my ass for weeks!"
[3:59:15] <%zyberion626> Tali is filming this to sell to quarians
[3:59:15] <Drunkengen> Legion must be thinking what his K/D is like
[3:59:18] <DSD24> Ok she's ok
[3:59:22] <+fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[3:59:22] <%chance_h> I just wish u could romance legion
[3:59:22] <stantheman_97> Vanguard is so busted holy shit
[3:59:24] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I really hope I don't miss Pat getting Legion in ME2, I wanna know what the hype is about
[3:59:25] <Sunstalker> Yeah, imagine what this looks like to Legion and then when he finally meets you in 2, Sheperd learned to catapult themselves into enemies as well.
[3:59:25] <ZeroWhitewolfx> doodLUL
[3:59:26] <$Solid_Stro> Legion is watching this like “This guy is super cool, I need his merch!” sabert14Comfy
[3:59:26] <%Papa_Bearman> What difficulty is this on?!
[3:59:27] <DSD24> Lessss goooo
[3:59:29] <Pookiedaexzile> The Richest Human in history, almost unkillable, and the first human spectre
[3:59:30] <+michingmallecho> They literally had Shepard die in space in ME2 and it was but a flesh wound... LUL
[3:59:32] <Profmcstevie> HOLD....FOWARD
[3:59:32] <+aartbastiaan> he didn't fight the 6 krogans in that hallway
[3:59:33] <+even_the_yuenglings> KISAMA
[3:59:33] <SaltyAzteca> SAREN HAS NO CHANCE AT SACRIFICE
[3:59:36] <%king_wragles> Tali is kinda banged up, but other than that all is A ok
[3:59:36] <tranquilturnip> LUL
[3:59:37] <%Papa_Bearman> SADDLER!
[3:59:38] <AngryAsian5> Legion loved this so hard he has a memento of this tattooed on his chest
[3:59:39] <tigo0donnell> The shotgun is so powerful in this game, I love it
[3:59:40] <tanarath> @patstaresat shhhhh, barrier is fine

[3:59:44] <tranquilturnip> SHOCKERR
[3:59:46] <+michingmallecho> CHRISSSSS
[3:59:48] <ScreamLord> This is why Barrier is locked behind Jacob in ME2 and whoever in ME3
[3:59:49] <%jillpilled> SHOCKERRRR
[3:59:52] <SaltyAzteca> PAT HAS 141 and 2/3% CHANCE OF WINNIN
[3:59:53] <+evbites> @zyberion626 wrex is like  this is the most krogan being in reality
[3:59:53] <%Monkeyweed21> KAAAAREEEN
[3:59:57] <%zyberion626> Saren: ohshitohfuck
[3:59:58] <%Nuclearcherries> Saren it's time for your freaky transformation!
[3:59:58] <%dekkitout> Does Shep qualify to kick it with the Silent Space Marine Crew? Seamus, Doomguy, Chief?
[3:59:59] <PirateMike_> JASOOON!
[3:59:59] <+D00msDayDan> ARMSTROOOONG
[4:00:00] <+Burdenslo> Make him shoot himself!
[4:00:01] <ZeroWhitewolfx> DAMN
[4:00:03] <Clundy> After this everyone’s like “What’s Shepherds favorite store on the citadel?”

[4:00:05] <superstarshizzy> SHAAUUUNNN
[4:00:06] <+liquidzr0> TETSUOOOOO
[4:00:06] <NitronStreams> Freezaaaaaaaa
[4:00:06] <+even_the_yuenglings> its why they nerfed it in the other games
[4:00:06] <tigo0donnell> @screamlord Only for Sentinel Armor to exist
[4:00:09] <%Rumbutt> I just cracked the code, Saren is SPACE KAREN
[4:00:10] <Sunstalker> Legion = the Adoring Fan but done right.
[4:00:13] <awalbaru> the barrier LUL
[4:00:15] <+JustToWatch> FRIEZAAAAAA

[4:00:29] <@Moobot> @Khester824 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 48s.
[4:00:29] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @Bane_Kaikyo What do you mean? I don't understand...
[4:00:30] <%StrawberryPantsu> MAKE HIM KILL HIMSELF
[4:00:31] <ZeroWhitewolfx> BRING ME SAREN
[4:00:31] <+michingmallecho> KANEEDAAA
[4:00:31] <AluxStreams> The way you're playing this totally makes the way everyone talks about Shepard in the other games seem justified. lol
[4:00:33] <i_chevalier> "I'm tired of the mother fuckin geth, on this motherfunkin Citadel." S.J.
[4:00:34] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype

[4:00:56] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Ass effect
[4:00:56] <+Ghufufin> save the ROOMBA!
[4:00:56] <PirateMike_> Saren is literally the green goblin
[4:00:57] <%Papa_Bearman> I have never, ever seen the actual fight.
[4:00:58] <fugly_nick> That was not slow work
[4:00:59] <%justnathan18> Sarens mech arm is cool af
[4:01:01] <+Pequod1> Tech armor made Sentinel best class
[4:01:01] <%LumberjackJack> Not exactly the best cover, Shepard
[4:01:03] <$realm_forge> Saren was playing galaga
[4:01:05] <SaltyAzteca> HE STARTS MONOLOGUING
[4:01:05] <+senfood> ok I can't be the only one who hard the aaaaaaAAAAA from Soulja Boy
[4:01:07] <Pookiedaexzile> O H L A W D H E F L O A T I N
[4:01:10] <$Solid_Stro> SASUKEEEEEEE!!!
[4:01:11] <DSD24> Complete Global Saturation
[4:01:12] <+Pequod1> Overload and Biotics? heaven
[4:01:13] <+JustToWatch> IN THE END IT HAS TO BE THIS WAY
[4:01:15] <+evbites> No
[4:01:16] <Aydarkzero> I hope this rail can deflect shots
[4:01:16] <%dekkitout> Too bad Shep and Saren are fighting shirtless
[4:01:19] <otakon17> his MAGIC SPACE ROOMBA
[4:01:21] <%dekkitout> *arent
[4:01:22] <%justnathan18> Just Shoot Him!
[4:01:24] <signofzeta> Saren might be an asshole, but he can appreciate a good rivalry
[4:01:34] <otakon17> more cybernetics
[4:01:35] <ergulor> ah
[4:01:39] <%CalderGaming> aw that sucks
[4:01:40] <%zyberion626> Soverign: oh my god. . . he's monologuing
[4:01:40] <+Burdenslo> I am the storm that is approaching Shepard
[4:01:41] <Ashrox117> Gray Goblin says God Speed Spectreman
[4:01:41] <otakon17> WAIT REALLY?
[4:01:42] <DSD24> Man
[4:01:43] <%Papa_Bearman> Faker?  I think YOU'RE the fake Spectre around here!  You're comparing yourself to ME?!  HA!  You're not even good enough to be my fake!
[4:01:43] <+michingmallecho> LUL LUL
[4:01:43] <KeystoneA2> Yeah, missed opportunity there
[4:01:43] <bigshedman> wait fucking what
[4:01:43] <ZeroWhitewolfx> ah
[4:01:43] <+RainFerret> Yeah I always thought that was weird
[4:01:44] <tigo0donnell> @screamlord Nah, in ME2 it’s actually better than Barrier, not completely sure about 3, but it’s more durable and dependable
[4:01:44] <asylumkon> oooooh
[4:01:44] <%X2Eliah> WHY DIDNT THEY FIX IT FOR LE
[4:01:44] <+aartbastiaan> There's no time
[4:01:45] <Ardailec> Well now he's more glowy
[4:01:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> that makes sense
[4:01:46] <LluthyY> oh really??
[4:01:46] <Clundy> Saren now has the robo-dong
[4:01:49] <%ScottishMadJacko> did you ever see the mod that implemented pre upgrade saren?
[4:01:49] <ZeroWhitewolfx> pfft
[4:01:50] <%justnathan18> That wouldve been so much more effective
[4:01:51] <%DianaTheAscian> WOW
[4:01:51] <Aydarkzero> that kinda sucks
[4:01:52] <otakon17> I mean I know he had the Geth arm for a while
[4:01:52] <+holyxgrale> That makes so much more sense
[4:01:56] <%Eilocke> that is fucking crazy
[4:01:57] <%Varlinator> He's more glowy here though
[4:01:57] <awalbaru> that explains a lot
[4:01:59] <%Nuclearcherries> That kinda sucks fr.
[4:01:59] <%JohnAtDawn> HOW DID THEY NOT FIX THIS?!
[4:01:59] <fugly_nick> Apparently a mod fixed that
[4:01:59] <Nautilaa> male shep voice actor sucks
[4:02:01] <+vaderxyz1970> Really!?!?
[4:02:02] <tranquilturnip> Imagine if he had like 3-4 models
[4:02:02] <%Papa_Bearman> They didn't fix a TON of shit for LE.
[4:02:02] <asylumkon> that confused me so much as a teen
[4:02:02] <DSD24> He got a Geth Arm
[4:02:03] <$sarah_galb> didnt someone make a mod for his appearance
[4:02:03] <otakon17> but it would have been cool seeing him get his arm blown off at first
[4:02:03] <Jetsfantasy> That's so lame
[4:02:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Lol
[4:02:04] <%NateyBeak> GASP
[4:02:05] <jorniev> that's lame
[4:02:06] <Hairy_butts> I didn't know that :0
[4:02:07] <chronoxgp> to accomplish what no man has accomplished, PREGNANCY!
[4:02:08] <Sunstalker> Oh, so it's like Errol and the Dark Makers in Jak 3 LUL
[4:02:08] <AluxStreams> He literally has Geth arms.
[4:02:09] <HaroldDonchee> man that would have been really cool
[4:02:09] <tanarath> THIS IS SO DUMB
[4:02:10] <%chance_h> The best part of this dialogue is that you can convince him to off himself
[4:02:11] <+pmtriox> oh no..they broke his hand
[4:02:12] <+even_the_yuenglings> femshep is way better
[4:02:14] <%Papa_Bearman> They didn't even fix the Conrad Verner glitch!
[4:02:15] <Pookiedaexzile> They couldn't just replace teh arm
[4:02:16] <Mattais88> I always assumed he just got really fucked up during Spectre work
[4:02:26] <+vaderxyz1970> They couldn't make a new model for the remaster!?!
[4:02:27] <SaltyAzteca> ITS GREEN
[4:02:29] <DSD24> Symbiosis
[4:02:31] <ioci2112> saren goes for the synthesis ending
[4:02:33] <+aartbastiaan> Synthetic
[4:02:33] <%dekkitout> Is it tho?
[4:02:33] <%Papa_Bearman> So...SYNTHESIS??
[4:02:33] <%miguelrod777> symbiotic huh
[4:02:35] <%Eilocke> fun fact: parasitism is a form of symbiosis
[4:02:37] <dauver> green ending fan right there
[4:02:39] <tranquilturnip> a vision of GREEN
[4:02:39] <DSD24> The Green Stuff
[4:02:40] <KeystoneA2> Funny thing, too: Everything Saren is saying here is essentially the Synthesis ending in ME3.
[4:02:41] <+even_the_yuenglings> sybiosis NotLikeThis
[4:02:41] <Sunstalker> THE ULTIMATE CENTRIST
[4:02:43] <%Wallabri> ok, ah he picked Synthesis ending
[4:02:43] <+liquidzr0> SYNTHESIS ENDING
[4:02:44] <otakon17> hes'...referring to THE "BEST" ENDING
[4:02:44] <mak0t0yukii> I AM GOD
[4:02:44] <PinkSocks> green ending
[4:02:45] <wolverinewaswrong> Why a geth arm?
[4:02:46] <%ScottishMadJacko> man he is full synthesis
[4:02:46] <+black_pariah> synthesis was the endgame
[4:02:47] <tigo0donnell> They most likely didn’t fix it because much of the original team on this game no longer works on BioWare
[4:02:47] <%zyberion626> and this is why synthesis is bull
[4:02:48] <%X2Eliah> yeah actually synthesis
[4:02:48] <%Varlinator> SYNTHESIS!
[4:02:48] <jorniev> PARASITE
[4:02:49] <+michingmallecho> Full globs synthesis's
[4:02:50] <JetpackMcQuack> now that's punk
[4:02:50] <+BigBruthaThunda> SYMBIOTIC U SAY??
[4:02:52] <+pmtriox> OH BOY WOULD IT NOT BE HORRIBLE IF THIS WAS THE OPTIMAL ENDING OF THE GAME?
[4:02:56] <vilecrois> phyrexia forever
[4:02:56] <+evbites> pick destroy just to spite him
[4:02:58] <stantheman_97> "i sought the strength and purity of steel"
[4:03:01] <xcompleasedad> Synthesis looks REALLY bad with this cutscene
[4:03:02] <tranquilturnip> Synthesis is better tho cause its actually seamless
[4:03:03] <seniormeatbox> TO BE FAIR HE IS THE LEAST DISFIGURED OF ALL REAPER'D ORGANICS
[4:03:06] <+senfood> BUT SHEPARD, THEY GAVE ME THIS SICK ASS JETPACK
[4:03:07] <%Movemeister> Yeerk PogChamp
[4:03:09] <%dekkitout> So what's the downside to getting cyborg'd up?
[4:03:09] <Sp3ctre48> Sure would be dumb if we ended up having a choice to agree with this nonsense in a few games
[4:03:09] <Alzero83> Never Back Down!!!!!!
[4:03:10] <+Burdenslo> The flesh is weak
[4:03:11] <trueGarnish> FeelsBadMan
[4:03:11] <ShiningAxis> looks like he chose lemon lime
[4:03:11] <Aydarkzero> Speech 100
[4:03:13] <%Garthunox> RE BOWTH!
[4:03:14] <asylumkon> i dont think ive ever seen this fight happen due to the dialogue defeat
[4:03:15] <Happy_Acciden> is this the part where he shoots himself
[4:03:16] <PinkSocks> Speech 100
[4:03:19] <DefaultSettiings> my god, make him shut up HahaDoge he's like that guy at the bus stop who talks about how the government is after me
[4:03:20] <+TrevSmith222> That was easy
[4:03:22] <%JohnAtDawn> @PatStaresAt They re-released this game three times and never fixed the model issue?
[4:03:23] <+EySoyCoco> You could make saren suicide right?
[4:03:27] <awalbaru> Actually the Illusive man dialogue LUL
[4:03:28] <KeystoneA2> "Kill yourself lol"
[4:03:28] <%Eilocke> "maybe you're right, OH NO mind control!"
[4:03:30] <Pookiedaexzile> this sucks so much more now that PAt said thaat
[4:03:31] <KeiPrime> god dman, mass effect 3 really fucking torpedoes this, doesn't it?
[4:03:32] <%Varlinator> It looks like he may commit suicide...
[4:03:33] <+michingmallecho> yes

[4:03:34] <cubelock555> i love how sudden this is

[4:03:54] <tattleworm> the renegade option makes waaay more sense
[4:03:54] <+eanscrale> how melodramatic
[4:03:54] <%Varlinator> SUICIDE IS BADASS!
[4:03:54] <%KuroStardust> SPEECH 100
[4:03:55] <Alzero83> DOUBLE TAP
[4:03:55] <iggeh> i am so happy that he shot himself
[4:03:55] <%skeleklng> Too bad you couldn't do that for ashley

[4:03:58] <%TheFabledAble> THEYLL NEVER SEE IT COMINNNNNNNN
[4:03:59] <+Shockrates20XX> Jesus, I haven't heard "an hero" in fifteen years.
[4:03:59] <wolverinewaswrong> Does anyone actually fight him?
[4:04:00] <+michingmallecho> o7
[4:04:00] <Ipsenscastle> the sickest death scene
[4:04:02] <SaltyAzteca> WE SAVED THE TOWN
[4:04:03] <%justnathan18> Imagine that being the actual end lmfao
[4:04:03] <Alzero83> Dont forget to DOUBLE TAP
[4:04:03] <+vaderxyz1970> CHARISMA IS NOT A DUMP STAT
[4:04:03] <soundcloud_raptor> he is president of thebank
[4:04:04] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> So many Narc points
[4:04:05] <Phoenix_gryph0n> What a hero mossyWut
[4:04:06] <zhukis> That Paragon EXP
[4:04:06] <%CalderGaming> synthesis doesn't come with strings attached like this does. it's a facile solution in its own way but it's not the same
[4:04:06] <mak0t0yukii> We save the galaxy
[4:04:06] <Zebroneath> If only that worked ALL the time
[4:04:07] <%anticrust> boy it would be stupid if he got up after that
[4:04:07] <badguy8312> final boss sidestepped!
[4:04:07] <+Pequod1> I think someone else gets the double tap?
[4:04:08] <DSD24> Now confirm the Kill Wrex
[4:04:08] <%Mekhet09> Without the worst fight in the game
[4:04:09] <Jane_Lo> We saved the city, Patck!
[4:04:09] <spongeofmystery> The Renegade line for this option is so cool, it's basically "You can still end this if you've got the balls to shoot yourself"
[4:04:09] <Phoenix_gryph0n> This game
[4:04:10] <dero45> redemption achieved
[4:04:10] <KeiPrime> yeah i know, but this especially hurts
[4:04:10] <jorniev> he really should have talked more about it

[4:05:40] <SaltyAzteca> WE HAVE BIG FAVOURS NOW. THEY OWE US
[4:05:40] <+Shockrates20XX> I hate that it words the choices that way. Leaving the council seems like the "logical" decision.

[4:06:01] <DSD24> The Ship is really rad so its why I saved them
[4:06:01] <%Mekhet09> I hated that the neutral option was just the renegade option but nicer.
[4:06:01] <%Ranryu692> oh look, those monkeys with big guns showed up
[4:06:02] <+MightyDuckShoes> Wrex: Don't do it Shepard. They'll just cut off your balls. All four of them!

[4:06:11] <%Bane_Kaikyo> That was confusing as hell.... He was all "Sovereign is so dope haha" but then after like 2 sentences from Shep he's all like "Oh, he's in my head? guess I'll kill myself".... like what? I blinked and missed how it made sense
[4:06:11] <%jillpilled> Look at all those dead humans the council won't remember!
[4:06:15] <i_chevalier> if they don't let you on the council now.

[4:08:32] <Zebroneath> GG
[4:08:33] <%Monkeyweed21> ITS JUST A GETH STALKER
[4:08:34] <%LumberjackJack> D:
[4:08:35] <%Papa_Bearman> I feel like this fight is just pure damage sponge, no matter what class you are.  There's no technique, no strategy, just pump him full of lead.
[4:08:36] <SaltyAzteca> SENOR SAREN! THE NUMBERS DONT LIE! THEY SPELL DISASTER FOR YOU!
[4:08:36] <%Varlinator> I like that they added more Geth to the final fight
[4:08:37] <AngryAsian5> FUCKING MELTED

[4:08:42] <%JamesCorck> Just keep lifting and pushing and you're done.
[4:08:42] <KeiPrime> that last hit DID LIKE 60% of his red health
[4:08:44] <Zudrag> so how does the council deny the reapers exist after one jumps on the citadel again?
[4:08:44] <%walternatorz> fucking love the motlen lasers
[4:08:45] <%Mathochism> The citadel battle feels very Wolf 359.

[4:08:56] <+even_the_yuenglings> barrier is so broken
[4:09:00] <otakon17> PHASE TWO!
[4:09:01] <%X2Eliah> The only strategy is using singularity or lift on Saren to immobilize him
[4:09:01] <lunarbladeeclipse> never seen someone have such an easy run with this boss' AI

[4:09:58] <seniormeatbox> @thetunnelhomer the one at the end of ME2 is better
[4:09:58] <Ipsenscastle> Saren froze in mid air for me and I just stood there shooting him for half a minute until I won the game
[4:09:58] <dd44dostivei> @thetunnelhomer Vizir
[4:09:59] <%dekkitout> I've melted bosses in seconds that were more interesting than that...

[4:10:22] <%jillpilled> true
[4:10:23] <Pookiedaexzile> But its racist
[4:10:23] <AngryAsian5> Reapers is dumb LUL
[4:10:23] <+Juriasu> Saren needed to use the conduit or something?

[4:10:31] <otakon17> it wouldn't have
[4:10:32] <%TheFabledAble> @PatStaresAt so in a way, saren brokering with sovereign DID end up saving lives
[4:10:32] <asylumkon> what no
[4:10:32] <fugly_nick> He needed Saren to find the Conduit
[4:10:32] <dero45> he needed saren the geth wasnt doing much themselves

[4:21:12] <Oxybe> LUL
[4:21:13] <%luftraumm1> sandbagging is the only reaction
[4:21:13] <%Dr_DangerPhD> patshrug dot jpeg
[4:21:14] <%Torus1025> I think part of the thing with Ashley is that the game explicitly asks you to pick a favorite
[4:21:14] <NBD_Rab> how does Ashley feel about boats?
[4:21:16] <+JustToWatch> BOOOOOOO

[4:21:27] <+Sebenoth> but can ashley outrun the flash?
[4:21:41] <%Garthunox> cheer500 Pat, since the game now saved after your pick for Councillor, ME2 no longer asks you any questions related to the end of ME1
[4:21:46] <Ipsenscastle> if you nut in space you go backwards

[4:22:49] <Profmcstevie> Complex systems fall apart easier
[4:22:52] <%LumberjackJack> RIP Marauder
[4:22:54] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Cheer504 I'm confused. Saren was all like "Yo Sovereign is so cool, this shits the best haha" but then Shep says two things and he's like "Oh Sov is in my head? That's not cool. Time to kill m'self lol".... I think I blinked and missed how that made sense? like it happened really quick...
[4:22:54] <dd44dostivei> lol
[4:22:54] <%lemon_lore> wait cruella 2 is a thing
[4:22:55] <+D00msDayDan> marauder shields

[4:22:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> Marauder Shields?
[4:23:00] <SaltyAzteca> Its too early for that joke
[4:23:02] <jorniev> the PS5 ... the legends were true
[4:23:04] <+Ropcord> Marauder Shields :(
[4:23:04] <%SkyfireHero> that's happening to me when I play no man's sky
[4:23:06] <+black_pariah> justice for marauder Shields
[4:23:06] <%Monkeyweed21> Marauder Shields died for our sins
[4:23:10] <%Wallabri> Ahh, Marauder Shields....
[4:23:10] <%afronooch> god I forgot about Marauder Shields
[4:23:15] <jorniev> MARAUDE SHIELDS
[4:23:23] <%dekkitout> Marauder, I barely knew her
[4:23:24] <Zixil3> The last enemy in ME3 is a Marauder Shields so it is a joke
[4:23:43] <peachy996> Marauder Shields is a hero
[4:23:44] <tattleworm> miranda'd ask you a couple things they forgot to save, yeah
[4:23:51] <%ScottishMadJacko> yeah it has special clear saves
[4:23:54] <%Monkeyweed21> yea they fixed that in the new version
[4:23:56] <%Garthunox> It used to save before the final cutscene with the council
[4:24:00] <%JohnAtDawn> That's Charisma
[4:24:01] <vilecrois> it's called maxed CHA
[4:24:01] <Sp3ctre48> Paragon brainwashing is a hell of a drug
[4:24:02] <%LumberjackJack> Welcome to Paragon Shep LUL
[4:24:04] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[4:24:07] <Profmcstevie> Max charm, very convincing

[4:24:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> DIPLOMANCY
[4:24:11] <%Bane_Kaikyo> So it's like... social pheremones?
[4:24:12] <%cvp5127> LUL
[4:24:14] <LluthyY> the good old shep charm lol
[4:24:15] <FymackTheResurrector> saren lives in your head rent free
[4:24:15] <%GarbageNirvana> It makes sense because Shepard literally has a silver tongue
[4:24:19] <badguy8312> Sheps indoctrination is stronger
[4:24:20] <peachy996> Saren is both Indoctrinated and in Denial
[4:24:22] <NitronStreams> 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[4:24:23] <Erwin_Dedic> Talk no Jutsu. Works every time.
[4:24:23] <%justnathan18> Charmed him right into suicide
[4:24:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Soft Stats Hard Damage
[4:24:26] <Jaysky> @bane_kaikyo He previously had a convo with Shepard. I think it's implied that the moment of hesitation reminded him of his original intent.
[4:24:26] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[4:24:27] <tattleworm> did they fix conrad's paragon/renegade flags too?
[4:24:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Thats all it takes
[4:24:27] <+Ropcord> that's strong LUL
[4:24:30] <Jetsfantasy> It was a stat check, that's it
[4:24:31] <AngryAsian5> It's like dumping everything into speech
[4:24:32] <DSD24> Diplomancers
[4:24:34] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Looks like sov failed his Auth check
[4:24:35] <%Monkeyweed21> @Bane_Kaikyo no one can resist Shephard's Paragon Penis
[4:24:36] <%Rumbutt> to be fair, I feel like there was supposed to be a lot more interaction with Saren througout the game that got cut
[4:24:38] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Ok, Diplomancy's a pretty good one. That should be a stat in an RPG
[4:24:39] <%democrazyyy> patstaresat is live
[4:24:39] <%JamesCorck> Weeee
[4:24:40] <DatAsuna> The way I put the reapers motivtion problem is that they have ada wong syndrome

[4:24:51] <%JamesCorck> Good stream, Pat. Good hustle.
[4:24:52] <@PeachSaliva> Pat is like so hot
[4:24:54] <tigo0donnell> It was due to the issues with the save editor, Conrad’s quest is actually bugged in ME2, and they just ended up making it a joke in 3.
[4:24:57] <@PeachSaliva> I would touch his butt
[4:25:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> 3.5 has builds where you can turn hostiles into fanatical friends in one round, with no way to resist because you did nice words good.
[4:25:03] <%JamesCorck> Lets go!
[4:25:04] <%justnathan18> Love you guys
[4:25:06] <%AzureGale> Have a good weekend peeps
