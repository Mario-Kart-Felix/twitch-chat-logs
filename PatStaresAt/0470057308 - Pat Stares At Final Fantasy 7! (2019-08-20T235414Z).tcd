[0:34:22] <mrjohncarlton> Instead of Mako, why didn't Shinra just harness Hojo's BIg Dick Energy?
[0:34:23] <%ElenaManetta> Is he laughing or nodding
[0:34:30] <%FACELESS_GAM3R> twitchy ass motherfucker
[0:34:31] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Is he always laughing or having a seizure??
[0:34:31] <$valriot> Why are they just having a casual conversation on a beach
[0:34:32] <%reonome> this fucking game
[0:34:33] <%vaporousTippler> I mean, Hojo could wipe the party right now if he wanted.
[0:34:33] <%Evil_John_Cena> Evil_John_Cena subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months!

[0:34:39] <%Evil_John_Cena> Nailed it
[0:34:40] <Fredcome2bed> Ass4Days LUL ... Heresy
[0:34:43] <cisealnine> I will be back in after Aeris is dead.
[0:34:47] <%ElenaManetta> Did Kunckles pass out, wake up, pass out
[0:34:49] <%starotter70> Airght bye Hojo
[0:34:49] <%king_wragles> THIS IS QUITE WEIRD
[0:34:52] <%ElenaManetta> Not Knuckles, RedBull whoops
[0:34:54] <%Sh00s> yeah I've always thought this part of the game is really stupid...
[0:34:55] <%D33TR> thats illegal :(
[0:34:56] <%MegboyManuel> Kill him!
[0:34:56] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Why’s he got bitches?!

[0:35:01] <RupanSen> eh, not really
[0:35:01] <%NovaKnightmare> Yea but look at him isnt he funny?
[0:35:01] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Why aren't you?
[0:35:01] <rytisone> but it's a beach
[0:35:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> But then you'd ruin your VACAY
[0:35:04] <Valdorick> Stab him with bepis
[0:35:04] <%Nedlin> Does Aeris have a father?
[0:35:06] <%AncelDeLambert> Kill the source of all our paiiiiin!
[0:35:06] <%MegboyManuel> I cant believe.
[0:35:07] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat Kill Hojo now and prevent Dirge of Cerberus
[0:35:07] <%reonome> bitches love hojo
[0:35:08] <%juxtest> Thats not a very chill beach thing to do
[0:35:09] <deadredeyez> he seems like a chill dude
[0:35:12] <bendatron> LIVES WOULD BE SAVED BUT NO
[0:35:14] <Nina96> @bigstupidjellyfish1337 MONEY
[0:35:16] <%AncelDeLambert> @Nedlin you'll find out later
[0:35:20] <ape_hawk> i mean, he deserves it, given what we know about him already so far into the story
[0:35:22] <poweredscoot> But all he did was try to make a lion-dog mate with a woman
[0:35:22] <%MegboyManuel> that interaction was so fucking weird
[0:35:23] <%goose_attack_almanac> No one can die in the beach episode
[0:35:31] <+Calicocat30> @Calicocat30 is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[0:35:32] <%king_wragles> So why don't they kill him now?
[0:35:32] <rytisone> also lifeguard would be mad at you
[0:35:33] <%ElenaManetta> Being a time traveler staring at dictators doesn't mean the present day people were STUPID in the context of the world
[0:35:42] <$valriot> Just go talk to Josef Mengele on the beach, no biggy
[0:35:43] <RupanSen> tbh his fuck ups are mostly in the past at this point
[0:35:45] <%Nedlin> @anceldelambert cool, thanks

[0:37:39] <%projectmanatees> these must be some trying times if we have eggs
[0:37:39] <%ElenaManetta> So you know how in Pokemon, where you are determines what you run into? What is the theme logic in this game
[0:37:40] <%connos_procrastination> get big gaurd from the beach monsters
[0:37:45] <Jetsfantasy> Agreed 100%
[0:37:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> What do the eggs want? What's inside them? We may never know
[0:37:47] <%ElenaManetta> Why do you run into houses in a sewer and eggs on a mountain
[0:37:47] <rytisone> that dying animation is so shit, I love it
[0:37:49] <Gruntini> The haunted house is going to be fucking ridiculous
[0:37:52] <%patriotrenegade> so strong
[0:37:53] <%sporeian94> When got Russian Eggs running around with Dino-Tanks and frogs
[0:37:58] <%NovaKnightmare> why does ps1 tifa make me HOT????
[0:37:59] <%patriotrenegade> @AngriestPat Have you died yet
[0:38:00] <%Louie_Salmon> Wait what happens if the egg keeps opening
[0:38:00] <%Laecerelius> Yeah, the enemy dying animation is pretty great
[0:38:01] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat the next area is fantastic for leveling your limit breaks. Big groups of enemies that all die to one Matra Magic
[0:38:01] <%king_wragles> @sporeian94 I'm not sure there will be an open world
[0:38:06] <%starotter70> @AngriestPat If you run into a harpy, get the enemy skill: Aqualung
[0:38:09] <SleepyMaribo> Tankcerratops!!!!
[0:38:10] <%JohnAtDawn> The big guard enemies are in Wutia
[0:38:11] <%dheng1> He can’t get big guard until caith sith

[0:38:26] <grayjammer> I love how the egghalves just fucking freak out when they die
[0:38:27] <%sporeian94> Nah they're be an open world. That's why they're waiting for PS5 to do it cause better graphics capabilities
[0:38:33] <%starotter70> @AncelDeLambert Ah right, couldn't remember
[0:38:34] <%sporeian94> It might just be the first continent though
[0:38:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> go go cumbo rangers

[0:38:51] <rytisone> here comes hellboy
[0:38:53] <%Admiralpoosh> Admiralpoosh subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[0:38:53] <%Frost_Quill> Oh yeah, he looked like a big ogre.
[0:38:54] <%vaporousTippler> At least he's not naked like in 8.
[0:38:54] <%hot4dukat> the egg looks like pat
[0:38:55] <%Louie_Salmon> Man that's such a good model
[0:38:55] <$valriot> Rhianna PogChamp
[0:38:57] <%ElenaManetta> and you used him for a random enemy
[0:38:57] <%MegboyManuel> ooooh he looks better here than in 14
[0:38:59] <%StripesUltimateEdition> Ifrit looks a lot different pre-14
[0:39:00] <%nyphilem> nyphilem subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! wow
[0:39:02] <RupanSen> what is this satanic game?
[0:39:02] <%AncelDeLambert> pew pew pew
[0:39:02] <%arcaderabbit48> "Satan, do my bidding!"
[0:39:02] <%FACELESS_GAM3R> ahhhh ugly ifrt go away
[0:39:07] <%Frost_Quill> I'm used to his FFX and FFXIV appearance.
[0:39:08] <Desertfishing> @AngriestPat what version of Ifrit do you prefer
[0:39:09] <%sporeian94> Man Tiga's got some huge... tracks of land
[0:39:16] <%MegboyManuel> Man his 14 looks like shit compared to that look
[0:39:17] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Never forget, Ifrit was a stand in God of War
[0:39:19] <%AncelDeLambert> @FACELESS_GAM3R hey, at least it isn't 9's Ifrit. Man that one is ugly as hell
[0:39:24] <%ElenaManetta> WOAH this background is weird.
[0:39:28] <%AncelDeLambert> 10 is phenomenal
[0:39:29] <ape_hawk> of course you do
[0:39:29] <PrimeNeverproc> boiled eggs
[0:39:32] <Desertfishing> im gonna have to look that one up
[0:39:32] <%ElenaManetta> I can barely see the pathing
[0:39:35] <$valriot> XIV one is just a fuckin gremlins
[0:39:40] <%connos_procrastination> OST Kreygasm
[0:39:46] <%FACELESS_GAM3R> @AncelDeLambert i never really got around to playing 9
[0:39:48] <%supersugoisenpai1> Remember to fall in the train tracks and mash left or right
[0:39:53] <Basch71> most kino track in the game
[0:39:53] <Desertfishing> ok thats badass looking
[0:40:01] <$El_Desperad0> @valriot that's titan
[0:40:08] <%MegboyManuel> a dick in the ground?
[0:40:11] <%AncelDeLambert> @FACELESS_GAM3R it does not hold up in comparison to this game. I stopped replaying it halfway through just two weeks ago.
[0:40:14] <%sporeian94> Do you think Tifa could knock you out with her breasts? Like if she swung them at your head super hard could she knock a person out cold for like an hour?
[0:40:15] <%Jaxnos> #hotboysummer any time Ifrit is out
[0:40:17] <%Frost_Quill> I like to imagine Cloud was pissed that Sephiroth was rude to that guy, not just that Sephiroth was there.
[0:40:18] <ape_hawk> were the designers on acid when they made the enemies in this game?
[0:40:24] <%Sh00s> FF14 Ifrit looks a little like Malebolgia from Spawn lol
[0:40:26] <%LouieRouie> no doubt
[0:40:34] <rytisone> gambling done right
[0:40:36] <%MegboyManuel> A dong with teeth!
[0:40:44] <%starotter70> I get that
[0:40:47] <%AbnormalVoid> no it didn't
[0:40:50] <%vaporousTippler> Uh. It hasn't done that since FF1.
[0:40:57] <%Keyd00d> uh no
[0:40:58] <no_johns_justin> crazy talk
[0:41:01] <%Frost_Quill> Yeah Knuckles, punch that ground dick.
[0:41:03] <%vaporousTippler> I'm fairly sure even the train wreck of FF2 didn't do that.
[0:41:04] <grayjammer> That's nonsense pat
[0:41:06] <SomersaultJustice> no it didnt
[0:41:06] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat whens the LOST ODESSEY playthough
[0:41:11] <Ner234> IS IT?!
[0:41:12] <RupanSen> yeah I remember 6 having that
[0:41:17] <%AbnormalVoid> LUL apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[0:41:21] <%FACELESS_GAM3R> it is is that what happened to hojo
[0:41:33] <%ElenaManetta> HOW
[0:41:35] <%ElenaManetta> LoOK AT IT
[0:41:38] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, this is in all of two scenes
[0:41:40] <%Estuko> monkaS
[0:41:41] <%arcaderabbit48> Yo, doesnt Tankceratops live around here?
[0:41:44] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> How could you forget this awesomeness?
[0:41:45] <rytisone> Welcome to evil establishment
[0:41:47] <%ElenaManetta> I've never even played the game and it's such a massive set piece
[0:41:47] <%MegboyManuel> you said the same thing a few streams ago, regarding enemy targettng
[0:41:48] <RupanSen> speaking of trainwrecks
[0:41:50] <%sporeian94> Look at it it looks like two balls and a bong!
[0:41:50] <gustavozxd> oh yeah me too
[0:41:54] <%vaporousTippler> No one loses a father here, so it's easy to forget.
[0:41:59] <%Keyd00d> I played 6 a year ago and it didn't do that
[0:42:00] <spinalwizard> Anything older than ten years is unreliable at best.
[0:42:02] <+lethallunacyx> That's where the choo choo comes out of
[0:42:03] <%Frost_Quill> Tankceratops was in one of the FF7R trailers, right?
[0:42:03] <%Owkono> tankceratops isin gongaga
[0:42:05] <%AncelDeLambert> ... do these guys have a good steal? I don't remember
[0:42:07] <alrobot2014> how does one forget the massive evil sounding phallic object
[0:42:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> I also enjoy Redbull's little flip
[0:42:20] <Yukasmarvin> I don't remember 90% of the game past midgar
[0:42:26] <filialpails> how could you forget such a DYNAMIC area?
[0:42:31] <Desertfishing> mmm look at them polygons
[0:42:35] <%GarbageNirvana> So how would you describe the aesthetic of this game exactly? I dunno if I'd call it cyberpunk
[0:42:38] <%arcaderabbit48> @alrobot2014 To be fair, there are a lot of evil phallic things in this game
[0:42:44] <%king_wragles> Dolphin kick is pretty great
[0:42:46] <alrobot2014> good point
[0:42:47] <%starotter70> It's why she's always in the party
[0:42:47] <%zamzoph> Tifa has the best.... limit break.
[0:42:48] <%connos_procrastination> apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong
[0:42:49] <%AbnormalVoid> Not really
[0:42:49] <%AncelDeLambert> Magipunk
[0:42:50] <%LouieRouie> this place is a big part of Barret's backstory
[0:42:53] <%Keyd00d> Industrialpunk
[0:42:54] <%AbnormalVoid> It's middling
[0:43:00] <%vaporousTippler> No point in bombing that reactor. There's no civilians to die from it.
[0:43:04] <ape_hawk> she has such huge limit breaks
[0:43:05] <%Mega_Pengers> which version is this again?
[0:43:05] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Tifa's got excellent.... attacks
[0:43:06] <%Frost_Quill> I don't remember Cloud's sword being so stumpy.
[0:43:08] <shiny_prinny> i suck at the slots so i usually use someone other than tifa
[0:43:11] <lionmanguy> !uptime
[0:43:12] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 43m 13s.
[0:43:12] <%nyphilem> idk why, but I remembered this game looking worse
[0:43:15] <%nyphilem> it holds up decently
[0:43:17] <%Keyd00d> Seitch
[0:43:18] <%nyphilem> well
[0:43:18] <%AncelDeLambert> I believe the actual phrase is "Deiselpunk"
[0:43:23] <PrimeNeverproc> never used tifa cause i hate reels
[0:43:24] <FirearmsInstructor> WTF
[0:43:24] <%nyphilem> as decent as a ps1 game can
[0:43:26] <+Dauntasa> ded

[0:43:31] <alrobot2014> they don't like redbull
[0:43:31] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Fucking gangraped your dog.
[0:43:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh yeah, I guess it would be dieselpunk wouldn't it
[0:43:38] <FirearmsInstructor> Focus fire on fire doggo ;(
[0:43:39] <%PanicSwytch> U killed Elmo
[0:43:40] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Do you think this Reactor will be a dungeon in the remake?
[0:43:41] <%MegboyManuel> Monk LB three from 14 still the best in the entire series, prove me wrong
[0:43:41] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat matra magic everything
[0:43:44] <rytisone> big succ
[0:43:44] <spinalwizard> Floating fish ass motherfuckers
[0:43:44] <%king_wragles> @Frost_Quill he doesn't have the starting sword equipped.
[0:43:48] <%vaporousTippler> Go figure. Monster hates Red Bull.
[0:44:03] <$El_Desperad0> mommy uwu
[0:44:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> @vaporousTippler lol
[0:44:18] <%Sh00s> I would eat, beat & skeet :)
[0:44:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:44:26] <%Frost_Quill> Diamond Dust?
[0:44:29] <%PanicSwytch> Waifu Shiva
[0:44:30] <%skizzuto> Shiva's always a great summon
[0:44:33] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Are summons this OP in subsequent FF games? I only played this one and FFT. IDK if it's just me, but summons seem *amazing*.
[0:44:33] <%GarbageNirvana> This game has some good-ass video game-ass noises
[0:44:36] <%VioletHeart> VioletHeart subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! Final Fantasy 7, more like Final... uh... Lame. Yeah gottem.
[0:44:37] <POCKETSANDX> I just started reading steel ball run, what weird shit should i expect ?
[0:44:42] <SoySocks> as Stamper once said, "It's like flossing something heavy out of your teeth"
[0:44:49] <%MegboyManuel> Shiva mami <3 apatGib
[0:44:51] <Basch71> the boss one is very cathartic
[0:44:55] <+Dauntasa> summons aren't actually all that good in this game other than KOTR, because they don't break the damage cap
[0:44:56] <%Keyd00d> Some weird shit
[0:44:57] <%starotter70> @POCKETSANDX Fingernails
[0:44:57] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Fuck petrify.

[0:45:04] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat The death / dissolve sound Fx as their model evaporates?
[0:45:05] <%MegboyManuel> giant Chimken
[0:45:06] <%nyphilem> @POCKETSANDX get ready for wondering what the fuck happens like at the start of the 3rd act
[0:45:06] <%Frost_Quill> BIRD KICK
[0:45:07] <+Dauntasa> FFX summons are probably the most OP
[0:45:11] <SleepyMaribo> if entire party gets petrified its a gameover
[0:45:13] <%AncelDeLambert> retreat if you have to
[0:45:15] <%nyphilem> @POCKETSANDX you'll know what I mean when you get there
[0:45:16] <grayjammer> @POCKETSANDX The dinosaurs all died because they understand the maning of "respect"
[0:45:24] <%Frost_Quill> The giant cock shot white mist at Knuckles.
[0:45:26] <%AbnormalVoid> QUOOOEEEAA
[0:45:30] <POCKETSANDX> hmm
[0:45:30] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Just made it.
[0:45:32] <%Sh00s> @FirearmsInstructor in 15 the summons are 1 shot kills but are only summonable if you're really suffering
[0:45:34] <MrTickleTrunk> It's too bad the "remake" won't play anything like this :(
[0:45:35] <%Bad1uck> God damned cocatrice
[0:45:35] <+StrawberryPantsu> What disk is NBatrick on?
[0:45:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> Everything went horribly wrong
[0:45:39] <grayjammer> *dindn't understand
[0:45:40] <+StrawberryPantsu> Still disk 1
[0:45:40] <%GarbageNirvana> I forget if petrify counts as an instadeath or not
[0:45:41] <%AncelDeLambert> there is NOTHING up here and it makes me angry
[0:45:42] <+StrawberryPantsu> ?
[0:45:47] <POCKETSANDX> they just ran into mrs robinson
[0:45:55] <POCKETSANDX> and gyro yelled some more
[0:45:57] <+Dauntasa> it counts in that if the whole party gets petrified it's game over
[0:45:58] <FirearmsInstructor> @Sh00s wow
[0:45:58] <%supersugoisenpai1> also nowhere
[0:45:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> Ye
[0:46:04] <%arcaderabbit48> @FirearmsInstructor Summons usually range from good to great. The early games ones might get phased out by better spells, but that's also when you start picking up the really explosive summons like Bahamut. So yeah, they're usually really solid
[0:46:04] <ape_hawk> BIRD
[0:46:06] <ape_hawk> ASS
[0:46:06] <%MegboyManuel> chimken butt!
[0:46:07] <+StrawberryPantsu> Dont know FF7 as much as I know FF9 and 8
[0:46:10] <%AncelDeLambert> silly Pat, you have enemy skill
[0:46:10] <%starotter70> @POCKETSANDX I completely forgot Mrs Robinson was a character
[0:46:12] <Ner234> HeckFlames
[0:46:12] <poweredscoot> Random plant with absolutely no significance
[0:46:19] <rytisone> I wonder if Barret has something to say about this area
[0:46:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> Got Im
[0:46:33] <+Dauntasa> summons kind of suck in 9 despite the fact that the entire story is about how cool summons are
[0:46:41] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat are you ready to MAAAAAAASH?
[0:46:45] <TheNewJapanGuy> Wait a minute.. this isn't YAKUZA 3

[0:47:36] <%skizzuto> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[0:47:36] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Because it let's you exert power over someone else in a cold, chaotic, and uncaring world
[0:47:37] <+Th3SmartAlec> Oh that Pat!
[0:47:41] <shiny_prinny> pat using consumables LUL
[0:47:41] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Hey, what do you think was a better / more amazing game *at the time*? FFVII or RE/RE2? (Also now, in hidsight, which do you prefer? I enjoy both for their own reasons. Nostalga.) :)
[0:47:41] <%AbnormalVoid> a crazy person
[0:47:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> Oh yeah Pat is crazy

[0:48:07] <%nyphilem> does ff7 have ng+
[0:48:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The first third of the speedrun for this game is nonstop grenade and molotov spam
[0:48:10] <%nyphilem> I don't remember
[0:48:11] <%AncelDeLambert> time to MASH
[0:48:12] <%ElenaManetta> You're gonna get run over, Heather.

[0:48:58] <alrobot2014> WHAT
[0:49:00] <ape_hawk> wizard
[0:49:00] <%Dementedpenguin> I legitimately forgot how many mini-games FFVII had....

[0:49:03] <alrobot2014> I NEED TO RESTART
[0:49:03] <Novapulsus> Worth it
[0:49:04] <bendatron> HE DIDNT KNOW

[0:49:06] <%MegboyManuel> What....just happened
[0:49:09] <%Wrashis> 15 has new game + eh? interesting
[0:49:15] <%MassConnect> I remember this in demo
[0:49:17] <%AncelDeLambert> MAAAAAAASH
[0:49:17] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I felt like a proud parent when I finally convinced you to put the pistol in the chest and take only the shotgun and your 100+ SHOTGUN ROUNDS XD
[0:49:17] <shiny_prinny> that's a double growth weapon
[0:49:21] <+Dauntasa> also 10 has a bug that is basically new game + in that it takes you way back in the story
[0:49:24] <%zamzoph> We need to see this Edelgard art...
[0:49:25] <%MegboyManuel> I.......what???
[0:49:25] <+Th3SmartAlec> ?????
[0:49:32] <%patriotrenegade> this is dumb
[0:49:34] <%starotter70> Nice job actually getting them first try
[0:49:36] <%MassConnect> seemed a weird section to put in demo
[0:49:37] <%AncelDeLambert> double growth weapons, ie THE ONLY WORTHWHILE WEAPONS
[0:49:37] <%ElenaManetta> What an annoying "minigame
[0:49:37] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> yoink
[0:49:41] <RupanSen> this also needs to be in the remake
[0:49:42] <%patriotrenegade> STAR PENDANTU

[0:50:05] <alrobot2014> i never understood what i had to do duing that minigame
[0:50:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> Rollercoasters are scary, that's why
[0:50:21] <%hadleys_hopeless> hadleys_hopeless subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:50:25] <FirearmsInstructor> ? What are people freaking out about? I'm missing stuff.
[0:50:34] <%WackyGear> WackyGear subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 20 month streak! You got me to try another game, I just bought fire emblem and am gonna give it a try tonight. Keep it up Pat! PS: I can't wait for the discussion of pee mechanics when death stranding comes out
[0:50:36] <%LouieRouie> it's just so dumb
[0:50:37] <%AncelDeLambert> transform materia, the most worthless materia, RIP
[0:50:47] <deadredeyez> i thought clumbo fell by himself off the ship or something
[0:50:50] <%Frost_Quill> I was doing a GATE in XIV's gold saucer, what happened?
[0:50:51] <%king_wragles> Make woosh sound when running around the roller coaster. It's for my immersion
[0:50:53] <%ElenaManetta> It was a strange section to get items with odd control prompts and it transitioned weird.
[0:50:54] <bendatron> ok is it just me or does brawling suck in fe3h
[0:50:56] <+Dauntasa> transform+added effect is fun
[0:50:58] <%AncelDeLambert> @FirearmsInstructor a lot of people used to always screw up that minigame and miss the good stuff
[0:51:00] <%zamzoph> the shack Kreygasm
[0:51:02] <rytisone> love shack
[0:51:02] <+Dauntasa> actually casting transform magic sucks
[0:51:04] <%MassConnect> The Shaq is the here

[0:51:52] <%MegboyManuel> they're dicks with teeth
[0:51:54] <%ElenaManetta> I'm surprised Pat isn't just fast-forwarding during all fights, I would be tempted to and probably ruin the game for myself
[0:51:55] <alrobot2014> are those mushrooms created from piss?
[0:51:58] <%king_wragles> BIRD DAMAGE

[0:52:30] <+Dauntasa> the encounter that is 6 frogs surrounding you is the absolute worst encounter in the game
[0:52:33] <%ElenaManetta> "It's tight in here" "Turn it like THIS"
[0:52:34] <+Dauntasa> you will never die to it
[0:52:36] <Futurecity10> @grayjammer THE SEXUAL THRILL
[0:52:36] <shiny_prinny> frogs can ailment lock you so they're really bad
[0:52:40] <%supersugoisenpai1> Making the bridge move costs money, cut away
[0:52:40] <FirearmsInstructor> I heard chirpy chirps! :D
[0:52:43] <%AncelDeLambert> steal their feathers, Pat, TAKE them!
[0:52:44] <%dheng1> I hate the frog status so much

[0:55:27] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat conceptual question, Pat: are you willing to use a consumable for an instant kill against a later boss?
[0:55:30] <+Dauntasa> go back up to the nest because I'm pretty sure the baby birds are already dead
[0:55:30] <%connos_procrastination> birdemic
[0:55:32] <+Dauntasa> like, instantly
[0:55:33] <%Sh00s> hahaha his neck

[0:56:27] <%SpookGato> had to wrangle my overgrooming kitty, what'd I miss?
[0:56:37] <%wjones0415> it's a hazard you can climb!
[0:56:37] <%AncelDeLambert> Climhazzard was dope as fuck in the movie
[0:56:37] <%MassConnect> climbing hazard: being short
[0:56:39] <%vaporousTippler> Clamhazzard is when Beatrix uses it.

[0:56:53] <%segonian> golden shower them. For power.
[0:56:53] <%ElenaManetta> Including your ASS
[0:56:56] <FirearmsInstructor> Mushrooms can pee!? D:
[0:56:57] <mr_slaide> Mushroom are kinda assholes.
[0:57:01] <T3merity> Pat would be worried that *multiple people* were peeing in his yard
[0:57:02] <%AncelDeLambert> the only reason AT ALL to watch Advent Children is for the limit breaks
[0:57:05] <+that_guy_from_high_school> I had a mushroom grow in my dorm room
[0:57:07] <%Frost_Quill> Missle Magic.
[0:57:07] <%connos_procrastination> norman reedus keeps pissing in my now mushroom filled yard
[0:57:10] <ape_hawk> mushrooms can appear on mushrooms
[0:57:11] <%king_wragles> The circus is in town?
[0:57:13] <%wsintai> @SpookGato Pat orphaned some babies in front of them to take a phenoix down

[0:57:26] <%wjones0415> nice!, ice2
[0:57:32] <%Frost_Quill> I'm sorry, did CLUMBO just cast Magic Missle?
[0:57:34] <%starotter70> @AngriestPat Which Limit Break are you most excited to see in the remake?
[0:57:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> Did you know: Stinkhorn mushrooms look like penises
[0:57:45] <%patriotrenegade> @AngriestPat did you know thanks to warming climate and increasing humidity, fungi and mushrooms that previously could not survive in the human body are now able to do so? what I'm saying mushrooms can grow in your lungs
[0:57:48] <%connos_procrastination> but i can never quite catch a glimpse of his penis
[0:57:49] <%AncelDeLambert> no lie, Matra Magic kills basically everything in this area in one hit, even at low level
[0:57:50] <derekwst3> i never realised how many dark souls easter eggs are in borderlands 2 d&d dlc thing
[0:58:02] <FirearmsInstructor> @patriotrenegade D:

[0:59:50] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 1 hour. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 4oz (120mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[1:01:27] <%ElenaManetta> I love it when stories point out how the main character is a trouble magnet
[1:01:31] <%logoth_> oh good we've reached Final Fantasy Staten Island
[1:01:44] <anAngryHamster> it wasn't...
[1:01:44] <%decisivelynameless> decisivelynameless subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Hey Pat! Do you have any plans to check out Remnant: From the Ashes? It's almost like someone took the Dark Souls gameplay loop, added guns, gave it an aesthetic like The Secret World, and then added randomized boss encounters.
[1:01:47] <%vaporousTippler> Barret is basically just Vash the Stampede.
[1:01:51] <hassanico1> Roboracism!
[1:01:51] <FirearmsInstructor> @elboryssan henlo fren
[1:02:02] <%arcaderabbit48> Shinra? Cause its Shinra
[1:02:07] <%LouieRouie> Why are they set up on the tracks
[1:02:08] <rytisone> Cole Train
[1:02:10] <%wjones0415> why are they blaming barret? I know the story and it never made since.
[1:02:10] <hassanico1> oh...
[1:02:15] <elboryssan> Hai
[1:02:27] <%Dementedpenguin> Nice... story?
[1:02:29] <hassanico1> @wjones0415 gotta assume Shinra was involved somehow
[1:02:34] <@Fuggins4U> Pat fix spider-man. Use your influencer influence.
[1:02:37] <@Fuggins4U> Influencingly.

[1:03:41] <danpc5> you got it when Paige was yelling at you for being loud
[1:03:44] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat you should use nothing except cover materia for all characters, all slots. ;)

[1:05:33] <@JustinianKnight> man I forgot about Clumbo
[1:05:35] <%Frost_Quill> But they've got a train. And no hobos living in it.
[1:05:41] <$SomeNEET> What did Yuffy get named?

[1:05:58] <$SomeNEET> nice
[1:05:59] <@JustinianKnight> this and one other shot
[1:06:04] <@JustinianKnight> a slightly more on fire shot
[1:06:05] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> did i miss golden saucer?
[1:06:08] <rytisone> will they do it in remake?
[1:06:11] <%Keyd00d> no
[1:06:19] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> ok
[1:06:20] <%connos_procrastination> yep they dont make em like they used to... sip
[1:06:20] <%starotter70> Dyne did nothing wrong
[1:06:20] <hassanico1> @bigstupidjellyfish1337 we just go here
[1:06:21] <Prism_Wing> This one shot! Pat love it!
[1:06:27] <%vaporousTippler> Shinra really lights up most towns. On fire.
[1:06:35] <hassanico1> BUT THE COAL MAN
[1:06:37] <%arcaderabbit48> The coal, man! The C O A L
[1:06:39] <+Noxyba> You can fault Squeenix for a lot of things but laziness usually isn't one of them
[1:06:40] <Desertfishing> wait you mean barrets mom didnt fuck a machine gun
[1:06:42] <%shotgunspaghetti> guys
[1:06:50] <%shotgunspaghetti> i just bought 1200$'s in funko pops
[1:06:53] <%averyoddjew> COAL
[1:06:53] <%juxtest> Introducing new Makoal
[1:06:55] <ape_hawk> is mako basically OIL?
[1:06:58] <%shawntk_> I can't believe FF7 supports the coal industry
[1:06:59] <%Estuko> @shotgunspaghetti are you okay
[1:07:00] <%Keyd00d> Ew
[1:07:00] <Clyderso> Holy shit this game
[1:07:04] <%arcaderabbit48> @Desertfishing No, she did. But that's completely unrelated to his machine gun arm
[1:07:05] <Basch71> its BASICALLY oil
[1:07:07] <+nathandiel> Vthese guys r Trump supporters
[1:07:08] <%genowyn> Love this pro coal message
[1:07:15] <%wjones0415> @ape_hawk more like nuclear power
[1:07:15] <%shotgunspaghetti> im dying...
[1:07:19] <%salty_syd913> rip
[1:07:20] <@JustinianKnight> yep theres the other shot
[1:07:21] <%Tennochief> F
[1:07:21] <hassanico1> @nathandiel christ dude
[1:07:21] <%reonome> lmao that fire
[1:07:23] <%vaporousTippler> If you slather yourself with oil, you get the knowledge of the ancients.
[1:07:23] <Ion_Laser> well shit
[1:07:23] <Desertfishing> also just realized he is named after an actual gun brand
[1:07:23] <%AncelDeLambert> the great part about this is that despite what happens next, Barret is COMPLETELY right
[1:07:26] <%LouieRouie> but then
[1:07:27] <rytisone> so expensive
[1:07:27] <%Keyd00d> Nice fire
[1:07:28] <%logoth_> Fucking Diablo GIF overlay
[1:07:30] <%genowyn> Aesthetically it's nuclear but it's oil thematically, mostly
[1:07:31] <%Dementedpenguin> AAA budget
[1:07:31] <%shotgunspaghetti> i needed to get my collection to 1000 funko pops
[1:07:31] <hassanico1> THE COAL'S ON FIRE
[1:07:35] <%arcaderabbit48> It is really odd that the game pushes such a strong environmental message, only to turn around and say, "You, coal is the shit tho!"
[1:07:35] <%shotgunspaghetti> and i did it
[1:07:36] <%wjones0415> damn, that escalated fast!
[1:07:36] <%genowyn> It's made by burning dead stuff
[1:07:39] <+Ell1ot> fire jpg destroyed the town
[1:07:39] <%zamzoph> TROGDOOOOOOOOOR
[1:07:41] <danpc5> mine pub
[1:07:43] <%Tennochief> man that guy just dropping dead
[1:07:47] <FirearmsInstructor> @zamzoph lol
[1:07:47] <anAngryHamster> How was any of this Barrett's fault?
[1:07:51] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yaaaay! Global Warming
[1:07:51] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> @shotgunspaghetti send them all to woolie
[1:07:52] <+nathandiel> Make.
[1:07:57] <@JustinianKnight> Shinra Inc.: Burning towns for fuel
[1:08:00] <+captain_history> I remember really liking this whole subplot
[1:08:00] <hassanico1> @arcaderabbit48 it's not that coal is good, it's just that Mako is way worse. But also this whole backstory helps set up Barret's more selfish motives.
[1:08:05] <%shotgunspaghetti> is the discord safe?
[1:08:08] <%AncelDeLambert> @anAngryHamster it isnt'. He has Survivor's Guilt
[1:08:11] <%Estuko> @bigstupidjellyfish1337 Woolie's known for loving funcopops
[1:08:12] <%shotgunspaghetti> i heard it's weird there
[1:08:13] <T3merity> its so terrible when rebel factions blow up reactors
[1:08:19] <+nathandiel> Make Corel Great Again!——Ahhhhhhh!
[1:08:19] <tigerfang86> R O P E W A Y
[1:08:24] <%wjones0415> @arcaderabbit48 no, but shut up! materia!
[1:08:30] <%Sh00s> calebBruh doodDah
[1:08:33] <ape_hawk> those damn rebel wilsons
[1:08:36] <%LouieRouie> stupid first AVALANCHE
[1:08:39] <Quinnotetiquan> has pat played this before?
[1:08:41] <%arcaderabbit48> @hassanico1 Oh, I know. Its just, did it have to be coal? Could they not have used any other reason why Shinra wanted to build a reactor here?
[1:08:49] <luckycloud91> hey @angriestpat what do you think about the new elder dragon namile?
[1:08:56] <FirearmsInstructor> @AncelDeLambert ... wait this ISN'T barret's fault?? I thought it was for like, 20 years...
[1:08:58] <Dooberoo> moo
[1:09:15] <%AncelDeLambert> Nope. Barret is completely not to blame. Shinra reacted like the psychos they are.
[1:09:20] <rytisone> you guys ready for some fireworks?
[1:09:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> truly, Pat is the best Influencer that Canada has.
[1:09:31] <@Fuggins4U> Fuggins4U subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Sub to your friends! It's how I make sure he can afford toilet paper. <3
[1:09:34] <hassanico1> @arcaderabbit48 eh, I guess they could change it to wind farms or something for the remake, but I guess cause it's a common blue collar industry? Helps build Barret's background and all
[1:09:34] <@JustinianKnight> coal existing alongside mako is pretty interesting
[1:09:35] <+lethallunacyx> But someone blew up their reactor
[1:09:35] <ape_hawk> can i pee on command? is there a pee button? pee prompt? is there a bar or meter that needs to be filled before i commence peeing mechanics?

[1:10:04] <%arcaderabbit48> This whole building setup?
[1:10:05] <@JustinianKnight> dude the one in 14 also makes no sense
[1:10:06] <ape_hawk> hey look, its final vegas
[1:10:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Time to farm shitty GP!
[1:10:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Just because there was an explosion doesn't mean anyone was trying to blow it up
[1:10:13] <%AbnormalVoid> it's so fuckin' cool
[1:10:15] <Desertfishing> you summon elemental gods
[1:10:17] <%projectmanatees> @vaporousTippler he's giant swinging monsters
[1:10:17] <+captain_history> and it's in the middle of nowhere
[1:10:18] <Jetsfantasy> That's why it has a dedicated Mako reactor
[1:10:19] <anAngryHamster> Fuck that murder and shit, HERE COMES THE GOLD SAUCER

[1:11:24] <RupanSen> Disney bought Gold Saucer?
[1:11:25] <%supersugoisenpai1> I hate when I go to Disney land and they make me pay to save
[1:11:26] <%skizzuto> irl microtransactions from Clumbo's perspective
[1:11:27] <filialpails> WHEN'S TRIPLE TRIAD
[1:11:29] <%ElenaManetta> nOT CP
[1:11:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> @zamzoph Yeah, but you go to both places shortly before things go to shit in the story
[1:11:32] <wookie5358> Save point with surprise mechanics
[1:11:32] <darcfowler1995> don't forget EA runs this place
[1:11:33] <%reonome> disneybucks
[1:11:36] <%NovaKnightmare> this is where EA got all of its ideas
[1:11:37] <+nathandiel> Win a ticket doing hoops!
[1:11:43] <%cureneckbeard> This is like... a MONEY SALE
[1:11:45] <%cylish> cylish subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[1:11:48] <SGrim> MICROTRANSATION!
[1:11:48] <hassanico1> WHY IT IS SO ACCURATE
[1:11:54] <%vectorless_peon> EA is run by Dio
[1:11:54] <%arcaderabbit48> It is... disconcerting how well this area predicted future gaming trends
[1:11:55] <$valriot> this song slaps hard

[1:12:10] <el_phthalo> Disney dollars!
[1:12:12] <+Dauntasa> the weirdest part about the gold saucer in 14 is that there's like, no way to convert gil to GP and nothing in the gold saucer costs gil. so how does it even make money?
[1:12:14] <%Keyd00d> WHEEEE
[1:12:16] <Ner234> WEeeEEeee
[1:12:17] <CherrieVelvet> paying to save is a surprise mechanic
[1:12:20] <ape_hawk> "look at the pretty fireworks, chewie!"
[1:12:21] <%GarbageNirvana> See you at the Golden Saucer! Bring money
[1:12:23] <rhus> in retrospect, it's fucking weird that the two ways into the Gold Saucer are a destroyed shithole of a town and a desert prison. that's it. no other way in
[1:12:24] <broth_elemental> Just mash all of our amusement parks together
[1:12:25] <%reonome> WHEEE
[1:12:26] <tigerfang86> AND LOSING YOUR HAND
[1:12:27] <%arcaderabbit48> @hassanico1 Gold Saucer does exist in 14, and is currently microtranscation free
[1:12:27] <%Frost_Quill> I'm literally doing gold saucer stuff right now.
[1:12:30] <@JustinianKnight> you can give gil for GP in 14
[1:12:32] <@JustinianKnight> but only a little
[1:12:32] <%Frost_Quill> in XIV
[1:12:33] <tigerfang86> BUT MONEY CHEWIE

[1:16:20] <%zamzoph> Sephiroth the same age as Cloud?
[1:16:22] <%wjones0415> MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!!!!!!
[1:16:22] <hassanico1> Who calls Sephiroth a "boy"?
[1:16:26] <rhus> "haha, I don't know :) "
[1:16:31] <+Ell1ot> the big bad being in a theme park seems kinda silly to me
[1:16:31] <hassanico1> I CAN'T STOP FLEXING
[1:16:32] <%Keyd00d> Dio calmed down as he got older and established a theme park
[1:16:38] <%GarbageNirvana> Does this dude just walk around his own theme park flexing on everyone
[1:16:43] <danpc5> theres an evagelion easter egg in the battle arena museum

[1:16:45] <@JustinianKnight> Seph is much older
[1:16:46] <%JohnAtDawn> Hey Pat, go get Omnislash now. You're totally prepared.
[1:16:49] <hassanico1> @Ell1ot all he said it was a dude in black with the number 1 on him
[1:16:50] <%wsintai> I want to see Sephiroth going down the slides in here
[1:16:50] <%vaporousTippler> It wasn't Sephiroth.
[1:16:53] <%Estuko> @hassanico1 teenage me when I got his shirtless skin on dissidia on the psp lol
[1:16:54] <xeros720> vineSchut
[1:17:01] <FirearmsInstructor> omg I want to go on a shooting coaster :D
[1:17:09] <%LouieRouie> Cloud and Sephiroth are not the same age. Dio is dumb as hell
[1:17:11] <darcfowler1995> if you play Dirge of Cerberus then you would know that he is indeed quite a bit older and so is Vincent
[1:17:13] <xeros720> blew my mind when i found out this was in FF14
[1:17:18] <redial_nick> go to the arcade
[1:17:22] <%supersugoisenpai1> Will suck dick for GP
[1:17:23] <Ner234> No GP DansGame Pleb
[1:17:23] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Buy GP @ the entrace behind the save point where the guy is.
[1:17:25] <danpc5> Dio is has dumb has dumbbell

[1:17:40] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat There's a "shady guy" you can buy GP from.
[1:17:45] <%Estuko> monkaS I encountered a player with "oh well hello there" as their description right when pat said it lol
[1:17:47] <%vaporousTippler> Dio vs Godbert would be amazing.
[1:17:49] <%starotter70> Only sometimes
[1:17:52] <%LouieRouie> Dip is still dumb as hell

He can be found quite near the save point as soon as you exit the cable car, and sells 1 GP for 100 gil (maximum or 100GP for 10,000 gil)."

[1:44:40] <%Frost_Quill> So gil is like yen then. Each game costs like 100.

[1:44:53] <Crankthulhu> People talk about how innocent Tonio is
[1:44:56] <tigerfang86> Pat will only eat the food when someone elses's eyes are exploding
[1:44:56] <Mr_Strut> Would you eat there after Paige is cured of Lupus?
[1:44:57] <%Keyd00d> I would
[1:45:08] <@JustinianKnight> if it fixed my back hell yea I'd eat at Tonios

[2:29:48] <%Emperor_Machinus> and how many bees in the peanut butter?
[2:29:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> That sounds like fuckin' MAGIC
[2:29:54] <wookie5358> Normal and smother don't belong in the same sentence
[2:29:55] <%connos_procrastination> you have to do the noise
[2:29:56] <%goose_attack_almanac> Peachnut Butter
[2:29:59] <%abakkus> blueberries or strawberries in pancakes > all others dont @ me

[2:30:39] <%TwentyCXII> Flavour Optimized
[2:30:43] <%Hobojo153> Pat you don't get it, you need to make the Pancake numbers big
[2:30:44] <KaliasTV> Just heat food up, cooking is all goblins
[2:30:45] <%HeadsHeldHigh> that is not min maxing, it's just maxing
[2:30:46] <%abakkus> paige making pancakes like: gotta make the chocolate number go up
[2:30:48] <%crimsonharvest> home made coconut syrup
[2:30:54] <%Shadicara> That sounds hilarious

[2:37:55] <mrvidicus> Shitty mini games to advance the rest of the game are the worst. Remember in The Hobbit video game for PS2 when you had to do that horrible fucking bottle puzzle?
[2:38:01] <asurite_warrior> I think there is a secret thing in this room.
[2:38:02] <%blittle42> blittle42 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:38:03] <+fallen92x> Hold R1 + R2 to recover your chocobo's stamina.
[2:38:18] <+fallen92x> hold L1 + L2 + R1 + R2 to increase your chocobo's speed.
[2:38:29] <FirearmsInstructor> WARK >:Y
[2:38:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> hold r1 and r2 while you're speeding. Good trick.
[2:38:30] <%Shadicara> apatBig apatCaw

[2:39:08] <Ion_Laser> HOES WARK
[2:39:09] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat stay on automatic until you're like 9/10s of the way through, and then just boost the whole way to the end
[2:39:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> now INCREASE the speed by x3!
[2:39:14] <iaraCatunda> it's so Easy!!!!!
[2:39:15] <%Hobojo153> If you're such hot shit, crush this rock with your bare hands

[2:39:23] <%supersugoisenpai1> I want to ride my chocobo all day
[2:39:27] <arkv01> BURSTO
[2:39:28] <mrvidicus> This game is to you what Morrowind was to me.

[2:39:41] <%arcaderabbit48> Come on, Kweh Rhapsody!
[2:39:41] <%Typhaeon> Jumping Flash for PS1 had great early polygon art
[2:39:45] <SulfurousAcid> gg ez
[2:39:47] <+neshatesthat> FF7 is still the best FF, can't wait for the snowboarding section
[2:39:47] <%actual_scum> It's almost as if reading the instructions helped
[2:39:47] <iaraCatunda> I played it last month and still though it was insane
[2:39:48] <alrobot2014> that poor chocobo's back
[2:39:49] <arkv01> oh man that fps is...
[2:39:52] <Nina96> SourPls

[2:40:22] <Nina96> DIO
[2:40:24] <iaraCatunda> DIO
[2:40:24] <+Bigdrifter210> DIO DA
[2:40:24] <Bladeexe> Funny how gold saucer does not call the authorities about someone being accused of murder. Just send them to the desert below then let said suspect go if they win a chocobo race.
[2:40:26] <shiny_prinny> the mandatory chocobo race would probably be cut I think
[2:40:29] <Ner234> C A R
[2:40:29] <arkv01> D I O doesn't fraternize with ex-criminals

[2:41:14] <%connos_procrastination> japanese bad guy age
[2:41:18] <EuropanLamprey> It makes me chuckle thinking about Sepheroth and Dio talking it up
[2:41:21] <ミュウレ4242> ♪little dune buggy. in the sand.♪
[2:41:23] <+ryosuke91kc> do you get to meet sephiroth in this game? seems like a cool guy
[2:41:25] <%zamzoph> @rumtumtugnutz Dio has seen the fanfics
[2:41:26] <+ryosuke91kc> u know...
[2:41:27] <Pnutz409> Speed menuing
[2:41:27] <Valdorick> Read that letter as "Now you can access the rest of only half of this entire land mass of 5 points of interest!"
[2:41:34] <JanusII> I mean Cloud is a huge Sephiroth fanboy in his backstory.
[2:41:38] <cassiecagedd> NIPPLES THE ENCHILADA
[2:42:00] <alrobot2014> does the slot you put the materia in matter?
[2:42:01] <iaraCatunda> I LOVE SHIVA
[2:42:09] <%ElenaManetta> Anyone whose weapon of choice is a comb is not cool by definition. Sans Johnny Bravo.
[2:42:18] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Go near Junon and use the manipulate materia to control a "Zemzelet" (white bat / lemur looking thing) and have it cast "White Wind" on you to learn that with Enemy Skill.
[2:42:20] <arkv01> cloud would do crossdress for daddy sephi
[2:42:23] <Pnutz409> @alrobot2014 only if it has a link.
[2:42:33] <alrobot2014> alright
[2:42:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @alrobot2014 depends on if it's linked to other materia slots and what it's paired with
[2:42:45] <%supercasualboom> Wait! Pat can’t drive!!!
[2:42:46] <arkv01> woops yeah haha looks like we'll finish the game today
[2:42:49] <%supersugoisenpai1> Home town of Zumbo
[2:42:49] <iaraCatunda> and i- OOP
[2:42:51] <cassiecagedd> take a look. its in a book. its reading rainbow

[2:42:56] <%Owkono> time for frogs
[2:42:58] <%starotter70> @alrobot2014 I think if it's an elemental then it depends if you have them on your weapons or armor
[2:42:59] <grizzlywhisker> the remake is going to be rad
[2:43:03] <mrjohncarlton> A village that produced nobody of importance Kappa
[2:43:04] <%Hobojo153> Let's go talk about Ass4days' dead boyfriend
[2:43:06] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat! Go get Aeris's ultimate limit break!
[2:43:08] <iaraCatunda> gongaga is so awkward
[2:43:09] <shiny_prinny> ok so barret's backstory done in 2 hr 30 min, how much is that in remake time?
[2:43:12] <+stuntdoublejesus> yes
[2:43:13] <%juxtest> The tropical paradise of Gongagag
[2:43:14] <%ElenaManetta> I don't have a point of reference for how much you have left.
[2:43:14] <%Hobojo153> This games not that long in hindsight
[2:43:15] <Pnutz409> But there's still a ton of game left
[2:43:15] <derekwst3> your walking
[2:43:15] <%Ranryu692> 3x speed makes a big difference
[2:43:15] <%connos_procrastination> 3x speed
[2:43:15] <ape_hawk> you are massively underleveled, pat
[2:43:17] <$shurtal> second continent does go by quick
[2:43:17] <%ElenaManetta> Plus you have speed controls.
[2:43:19] <danpc5> its normal if you played it before
[2:43:20] <arkv01> I mean the fast battle button helps
[2:43:21] <%AbnormalVoid> not really, you play it like once a week lol
[2:43:21] <+Sogeki_Dan> you are, cause it's EZ
[2:43:22] <TimetodiveLTX> Remake should let you save party layouts: Materia, Party Members, Armor, etc
[2:43:24] <%supersugoisenpai1> This game has fast pacing
[2:43:28] <iaraCatunda> yes but also you're still on disk one
[2:43:28] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat You're on a good pace. Smooth, but it's not crazy.
[2:43:30] <%Owkono> still first disk
[2:43:31] <JanusII> It's actually a fast paced game.
[2:43:37] <%Keyd00d> it's not hard
[2:43:38] <Valdorick> I mean, I've watched a speedrun of this game, my perception of "speeding through" is skewed.
[2:43:41] <Pnutz409> yooo frames go up!
[2:43:43] <Basch71> ff7's pretty fast
[2:43:44] <%Hobojo153> It took me like 50ish hours my first time a while ago
[2:43:45] <FirearmsInstructor> Tifa's *HARD*

[2:45:39] <%arcaderabbit48> Hey is it weird that after commiting a horrible atrocity and killing thousands of people, The Turks and relegated to Team Rocket duty for the rest of the game?
[2:45:39] <ElementalX1000> Their Yeezys
[2:45:40] <rhus> I like that Rude won't attack Tifa unless he has no other option. Nice detail.
[2:45:40] <%Hobojo153> Gotta say, the summons are actually still cool

[2:46:46] <+Sogeki_Dan> She has t hose two big old punchos
[2:46:47] <shiny_prinny> maybe rude is one of zangan's former students
[2:46:47] <%Hobojo153> Punch girls are good, but Axe girls are way better
[2:46:48] <iaraCatunda> I like tifa cause she suplexes
[2:46:49] <+OkamiDude15> "she does the big punches just like ME" sfhBLUSH

[2:46:56] <SulfurousAcid> Later NEEERDS
[2:46:57] <%NovaKnightmare> Rude leaves halfway because of Tifa
[2:46:58] <JanusII> I like a girl who plays piano and throws Gundams around like ragdolls.

[2:52:56] <+TheNewZealandStory> did pat get beta yet
[2:52:57] <cassiecagedd> then you dont have to put a summoner in the game.
[2:52:57] <%arcaderabbit48> @WackyGear Because he is Tankceratops
[2:52:57] <%zamzoph> @AngriestPat Do they even have an explanation for what summons are in this game?
[2:52:58] <%Frost_Quill> @WackyGear Because he's a TANKceratops.
[2:52:58] <mrjohncarlton> Because if only one person could summon it would be Aerith and yeah...
[2:52:58] <iaraCatunda> damn tifa limits
[2:53:05] <shiny_prinny> couldn't everyone summon since FF5
[2:53:05] <%supersugoisenpai1> Because of the Shinra
[2:53:06] <%connos_procrastination> he has to get around
[2:53:07] <FirearmsInstructor> @rdark_ksu That's absurd. Is an investigation at least underway?
[2:53:08] <derekwst3> its a treadceratops
[2:53:11] <filialpails> for traction

[2:53:36] <%Frost_Quill> Who put the treads on him? Was it shinra? Is shinra responsible for the monsters? Why does everyone love them if they're making all this bullshit and releasing them into the wild?
[2:53:40] <jou_star> the designer that made that either got a raise or got fired

[2:55:02] <+stuntdoublejesus> enemy skill early is amazing with Beta
[2:55:02] <%ElenaManetta> LOL I didn't ask you your life story, lady
[2:55:03] <Basch71> despite the best spells being enemy skills
[2:55:04] <Pnutz409> naw bro
[2:55:06] <%starotter70> Nah
[2:55:07] <anAngryHamster> Enemy skill is objectively best
[2:55:08] <FirearmsInstructor> @rdark_ksu shit does happen, and mail is delayed sometimes. If they're jerking you around then press them about it.
[2:55:09] <mrvidicus> I was looking away and thought he was reading a donation for a second.
[2:55:11] <scomm29> did sad death happen yet
[2:55:12] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> So you're saying she's single
[2:55:15] <rytisone> ohhh, this town
[2:55:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> I s this Camp Drybone?
[2:55:17] <+OkamiDude15> maybe if she played tripple triad the reactor wouldnt have blown Kappa
[2:55:20] <%arcaderabbit48> Guys, Knights fo the Round is not an Enemy Skill
[2:55:33] <DuoScratch> ya know, maybe shinra should get on inventing a less shitty reactor...they seem to blow up fuckin' easily.
[2:55:33] <+Shaggnar> Instead of building these life force sucking reactors why don't we just use the children as fuel
[2:55:35] <Pnutz409> Chernobyl
[2:55:37] <%Frost_Quill> TIME magic.
[2:55:38] <%connos_procrastination> id take a reactor for electricity man no question
[2:55:38] <TimetodiveLTX> I like enemy skill because it requires minimal grinding, AKA the worst activity gaming has ever produced
[2:55:39] <arkv01> @arcaderabbit48 only cause we'd never survive it to learn it
[2:55:41] <%rdark_ksu> @FirearmsInstructor depends on who I talk to. Local adjuster guy has been great but their corporate i'm lucky to even get those fucks to pick up the phone
[2:55:42] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat LITERAL Time stop

[2:55:52] <+stuntdoublejesus> if he had beta he'd be on shotting everything
[2:55:55] <%arcaderabbit48> @arkv01 I dunno, its pretty cool in 14
[2:55:59] <iaraCatunda> is he using the enemy skill materia?
[2:56:03] <Basch71> added effect time on weapon just fucks bosses

They dragged their ass sending a check until my attorney did a conference call with them like "So you acknowledge my client's loss is nearly double your maximum payout limit... so what's the excuse for not just sending a check for the maximum payout amount?"
[2:58:33] <lotharrio> Zack? Probably not important.

[3:00:41] <lotharrio> I had Tifa and Aeris in my party. So they mention this OTHER guy, Zack, and they both leave my party to look wistfully in the distance and mutter his name?

[3:03:30] <+BBnumber9> @AngriestPat What is your opinion on FF8?
[3:03:31] <KaliasTV> duDudu
[3:03:33] <%starotter70> SingsNote SingsNote

[3:03:35] <jou_star> Hippie Canyob

[3:03:52] <rytisone> the metal version of this music on youtube is also great
[3:04:01] <%LouieRouie> nani?
[3:04:04] <arkv01> "Nanaki is my weeb name"
[3:04:16] <lotharrio> PatXIII?
[3:04:22] <bluecrayon203> Holy Shit I finally get a chance to see the Ginger Goblin live! Hmmm What the.... Maybe I missed the vod but what the hell happened to the Goblin Gamer Cube? Did you break it or did Elmo eat it?
[3:04:24] <leargo> he is the only smart one, not giving his name to perfect strangers
[3:04:26] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Why are we suddenly in Brooklyn?
[3:04:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> Nanaki Bugenhagen?
[3:04:31] <arkv01> oh fuck cosmo canyon is a hipster weed smoking paradise
[3:04:34] <anAngryHamster> Can we talk about how Bugenhagen was lying to Redbull13 for years just to be a dick
[3:04:37] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> gamer cube is only for mouse and keyboard
[3:04:47] <+DingusMcFadden> Nanaki is a stone-cold bad-ass
[3:05:00] <$shurtal> Matrix 4 with Keanu and Carie-Ann moss confirmed... What even is life anyomre
[3:05:08] <danpc5> it was the ghost
[3:05:09] <iaraCatunda> @anangryhamster sjxkksdkd he really doesn't have a reason huh
[3:05:17] <arkv01> uh yeah bro I ain't here to vape with y'all
[3:05:27] <+DingusMcFadden> That was the line, @shurtal ? LUL
[3:06:05] <rytisone> no its a frog
[3:06:16] <%Sh00s> apatCanada hey thanks guy
[3:06:19] <%supercasualboom> Cheer500 CatFrog! CatFrog! Alone in this world is a little CatFrog! Evening Pat and Paige! Update on my project: Yeah, it’s still a thing. Just got a decent video editing program and been getting more confident with doing voice recording. Anyway, I see you got Frog Sith. Cool. Enjoy tonight’s FF7 as you ride your Chocobo Elmo and Paige rides her skeleton Chocobo called Chocobones.
[3:06:25] <$shurtal> naw, line got crossed years ago, I"m just easily surprised whenever something unecessary happens @DingusMcFadden
[3:06:37] <%NWR_James> this song is very good
[3:06:49] <leargo> read the panflet
[3:06:53] <jowi_time> read the thing in the inn
[3:06:56] <%vaporousTippler> Time to save the game, use it, reload, repeat.
[3:06:59] <arkv01> not using elixirs DansGame
[3:07:00] <%HeadsHeldHigh> M4trix
[3:07:06] <%Bane_Kaikyo> hey.... hey @AngriestPat .... weird question but would you rather have your hands replaced by clumbsy knives as replacements, or clumbsy guns for feet?
[3:07:09] <+DingusMcFadden> Sounds like a spooky way to live, @shurtal . You have my respect doodBro
[3:07:09] <mrvidicus> OOF
[3:07:12] <+OkamiDude15> big oof
[3:07:17] <$CarlosEoM> LUL
[3:07:18] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> not good enough to watch
[3:07:18] <+FutaSnek> rekt
[3:07:22] <%Tennochief> ouch
[3:07:24] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat They *NEED* to make a game where the final boss uses all your items against you that you don't use like Woolie said... (I think?) that's an amazing concept.
[3:07:30] <iaraCatunda> beat Sephiroth with 99 elixir in the stock
[3:07:31] <Neo_Kaiser> >:
[3:07:47] <iaraCatunda> oof
[3:07:50] <%zamzoph> Muh daddy issues
[3:07:55] <%AncelDeLambert> big edgey boi
[3:08:01] <%supercasualboom> Red dad a deatbeat
[3:08:04] <%AncelDeLambert> edgy doggo
[3:08:04] <%connos_procrastination> just like me im a wastrel
[3:08:13] <%starotter70> Shhh
[3:08:31] <%AncelDeLambert> buy that gud shid
[3:08:34] <arkv01> some of these will really kill people
[3:08:37] <%Mekhet09> who did he have a date with?
[3:08:39] <TimetodiveLTX> so you can immediately leave if you so choose
[3:08:42] <iaraCatunda> we're almost at Vincent o'clock
[3:08:45] <%Mekhet09> i hope it was barret.
[3:08:48] <%AncelDeLambert> @Mekhet09 that's later
[3:08:48] <%starotter70> @Mekhet09 Date is later I think
[3:08:50] <%ElenaManetta> I forgot, who was the winner in the Chrono Trigger vs. FF7 soundtrack debate
[3:08:52] <JanusII> So up until this point all of your weapons were worse than their replicas.
[3:08:53] <%ElenaManetta> Was it CT?
[3:08:56] <%Mekhet09> damn.
[3:08:59] <%AncelDeLambert> The date comes after you get the plane/boat
[3:09:03] <iaraCatunda> vincent next stream probably
[3:09:03] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Don't forget your "double" AP bonus for materia for weapons / armor. Sometimes 1-2 damage isn't worth it
[3:09:05] <arkv01> ohhh yeah the cosmo canyon section is 100% optional
[3:09:16] <%Mekhet09> pat keep your double shit on.
[3:09:18] <leargo> yah your weapons are shit
[3:09:28] <%AncelDeLambert> I think it's safe to say Pat doesn't care about growing his mats
[3:09:43] <bluecrayon203> How come it seems like a lot of final fantasy bad guys have mommy or daddy issues/complexes?
[3:09:59] <%connos_procrastination> ff7 OST is better than chrono trigger
[3:10:09] <iaraCatunda> the only materia worth grinding for is x2 cut
[3:10:11] <%Mekhet09> but you want to buy the house so you sell All materia capped.
[3:10:17] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat But what about 3x Grandmastered Knights of the Round? D:
[3:10:18] <%Keyd00d> CT OST is the GOAT
[3:10:30] <%AncelDeLambert> @bluecrayon203 because this game did it right and Squeenix has been trying to replicate it ever since
[3:10:32] <arkv01> oh god from hipster commune to eco terrorism...
[3:10:34] <%supercasualboom> @bluecrayon203 Same reason why each town have 39 houses and only 10 people live
[3:10:36] <$shurtal> I hate how there were only a couple enemies in the Northern crater you HAD to farm if you wanted to really fuck up things up with mime and knights of the round
[3:10:46] <mrjohncarlton> But Rufus created AVALANCHE Kappa
[3:10:49] <+BBnumber9> @AngriestPat What are your thoughts on FF8?
[3:10:51] <cassiecagedd> magic pot
[3:10:54] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god, trying to get that FUCKING hammer from that FUCKING titan in the crater!
[3:11:02] <%starotter70> Pat LOVES it
[3:11:04] <%AncelDeLambert> Screw that, Square, the HELL
[3:11:06] <%MoonObscure> LOL
[3:11:07] <bluecrayon203> @connos_procrastination I would fight you over that, I think Chrono Trigger is better
[3:11:10] <%Keyd00d> 👍
[3:11:11] <%reonome> he LOVES it
[3:11:12] <+Ilpala> BUT TRIPLE TRIAD
[3:11:13] <DuoScratch> I thought it was the red ball monsters that gave you the metric ton of materia growth.
[3:11:14] <$valriot> LUL LUL LUL
[3:11:15] <%Tennochief> ew
[3:11:15] <iaraCatunda> I'd like some magic pot
[3:11:15] <%PauliusMaximus> clemps loves it though
[3:11:22] <+Shaggnar> Your thoughts are wrong roo4
[3:11:28] <%Mekhet09> i can't believe he hates a game where you can get big number fast.
[3:11:35] <cassiecagedd> Tripple triad
[3:11:37] <%supercasualboom> Pat doesn’t answer cause FF8 not worth it.
[3:11:40] <cassiecagedd> the game
[3:11:50] <$shurtal> I never understood why people only ever drew magic from enemies in FF8, always rushed to get item refine and mag refine from GFs and the went to town junctioning shit
[3:11:50] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Do you like FFT or FFVII more?
[3:11:59] <ittla> im at the end of this game and i cant believe north cave has no saves it's fucked up
[3:12:05] <Rust_Wick> ff8 a shit
[3:12:09] <+AlteisenReiseZ> Pat, FF8 is all about abusing the FUCK out of the junction system
[3:12:11] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat A man of culture
[3:12:15] <%Mekhet09> i'll agree with that.
[3:12:19] <xoyv> oh pat likes tactics? is he a fan of math?
[3:12:23] <%zamzoph> @AngriestPat Which version of FFT do you recommend?
[3:12:24] <+AlteisenReiseZ> those who don't like it are WEAK
[3:12:29] <danpc5> you got a portable save tho
[3:12:30] <DuoScratch> well, there IS one...
[3:12:32] <%connos_procrastination> apatWrong
[3:12:32] <$shurtal> make yo save point with the crystal
[3:12:33] <+Ilpala> you gotta bring your own save point!
[3:12:33] <RupanSen> you can place one tho
[3:12:38] <%Mekhet09> it is if you were smart.
[3:12:48] <arkv01> this is my grandpa, a pool float
[3:12:53] <%Keyd00d> I'm 48
[3:12:55] <wookie5358> For a last dungeon, North Cave is really really small though
[3:12:55] <ittla> the walkthrough says the placeable save can break the game and i shouldnt use it lmao
[3:12:57] <%supercasualboom> Which is why FF6 final zone is awesome.
[3:12:57] <+peppament> @Angriestpat how do you feel about FFIX?
[3:13:06] <arkv01> he is of MATING age
[3:13:08] <iaraCatunda> @ittla oh no I'm just before north cave I didn't know that
[3:13:12] <%starotter70> Redbull is a 10000 year old myth dragon PogChamp
[3:13:13] <alrobot2014> so he's a horny teen
[3:13:14] <+OkamiDude15> it seemed cool at the time
[3:13:15] <danpc5> red rocket
[3:13:16] <ape_hawk> this is the reverse of the "i look like im 10 but im really 1000" trope
[3:13:18] <+Shaggnar> So can he or can't he consent I don't know
[3:13:18] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Isn't Redbull a dog???
[3:13:21] <%mastertwin2> You mean ASS4DAYS?

[3:13:26] <@lewdskeletor13> Underage beastiality, no big deal
[3:13:29] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I'm serious. I thought he was a dog... doesn't he howl and everything?

[3:26:50] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Well that's a deeper observation and analysis than my childhood wanted to realize...
[3:26:52] <iaraCatunda> oooooooooo
[3:26:54] <%Keyd00d> hmmmm
[3:27:01] <%reonome> oil is just dinosaur souls

[3:27:27] <%starotter70> Jesus
[3:27:28] <lotharrio> The Gi tribe... right, I still don't get their involvement.
[3:27:28] <arkv01> the GI joe tribe
[3:27:29] <%supercasualboom> My dad didn’t want to pay the Materia support
[3:27:29] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> or you could just tell him
[3:27:31] <alrobot2014> so is mako energy poisoning getting oversaturated in peoples souls?
[3:27:32] <leargo> oil is much older than dinosaurs
[3:27:36] <%Sh00s> there's literally no reason Bugenhaggen never told Red the truth about his father
[3:27:38] <Serge_12> How long is this game? 60 hours?
[3:27:42] <%Maids4lyfe> yes arlobot
[3:27:49] <+BlackfyreRoy> Shoulda named Yuffie "Liam"
[3:27:49] <%Frost_Quill> I've actually been LYING to you all your life, for some reason you had to hate your father?
[3:27:54] <arkv01> @Serge_12 speedruns are about 10 so you can extrapolate from there
[3:27:59] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> 20-30
[3:28:00] <%starotter70> Long
[3:28:01] <%AncelDeLambert> 40 hours, min
[3:28:01] <alrobot2014> when you put it that way it sounds terriffying
[3:28:04] <lotharrio> 5 borillion minutes.
[3:28:05] <wookie5358> 99 hours 59 minutes
[3:28:05] <FirearmsInstructor> I beat it in 24 hours rushing pretty hard through it when I was like 16
[3:28:06] <rytisone> 40 hrs if you mainline it
[3:28:07] <%connos_procrastination> long
[3:28:08] <%reonome> forever
[3:28:10] <a_mad_dragon> ***
[3:28:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> That fucking fire sounded like speaker static
[3:28:15] <%AbnormalVoid> @Sh00s at the end, Bugen says his father told him not to speak of the cave
[3:28:16] <Basch71> 20-30 on average
[3:28:18] <%wsintai> At least 19 days
[3:28:26] <FirearmsInstructor> If you want to go crazy and really explore then you can easily make it 100+
[3:28:27] <nocorpse> 420 Hours long
[3:28:27] <%joylent_blue> my playthrough where i did everything was about 60hrs
[3:28:28] <+BlackfyreRoy> It depends on how much he wants to grind and do side quests. Between 30 and 80 hours.
[3:28:30] <leargo> it depends
[3:28:39] <rytisone> but 3x speed
[3:28:39] <%DedlokPM> Longer than you think, shorter than you hop.
[3:28:40] <%Sh00s> @AbnormalVoid ahh ok. still dumb though
[3:28:41] <iaraCatunda> I've been playing on switch and I'm at the last boss with 40 hours
[3:28:42] <%AncelDeLambert> You're going at a good clip, and you're still not even half way through the first disc
[3:28:42] <%LouieRouie> I got to the end in an hour
[3:28:43] <shiny_prinny> it will be longer in the remake just because of cinematics and voice acting
[3:28:45] <%DedlokPM> hope*
[3:28:46] <TimetodiveLTX> !uptime
[3:28:46] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 28m.
[3:28:47] <arkv01> I think most people played this game over the course of 6 months to a year when it was first out
[3:28:47] <a_mad_dragon> 40-90 hours depending on your playstile
[3:28:51] <bendatron> !uptime
[3:28:53] <a_mad_dragon> *style

[3:29:09] <%Sh00s> Kenshi and Takeda have the same thing going on in MKX story.
[3:29:10] <FirearmsInstructor> 40-60 is a slow pace that allows you to explore and poke around and have fun
[3:29:11] <%wsintai> The sexnasium
[3:29:11] <%zamzoph> So is Bugen sitting on a ball or what?
[3:29:12] <%connos_procrastination> gramps aint no fool

[3:29:16] <DraxTD> @AngriestPat Time to beat sais anywhere from 30-69 hours
[3:29:17] <%starotter70> Love how the music Fades out
[3:29:17] <rytisone> Time for old man to perv on Tifa

[3:29:24] <%AncelDeLambert> and that's all DISC ONE!
[3:29:26] <SomersaultJustice> time for the big ghosties

[3:29:36] <FirearmsInstructor> PAIGE! RUN!!!!
[3:29:37] <JanusII> Through darkness and silence in the night.
[3:29:37] <KaliasTV> Grandpa had his butt replaced with an ORB
[3:29:40] <wookie5358> If you're a lunatic you can also do source farming and stat max everyone
[3:29:41] <arkv01> creepo music
[3:29:52] <%NovaKnightmare> it was full of GHOSTSD
[3:29:53] <Copperama> I just noticed Cloud's animation is him climbing up even if he's going down...
[3:29:58] <WhereIsWill> this place TERRIFIED me when i was a kid LUL
[3:29:59] <+exiled_blood> Have I missed the chocobo racing?
[3:29:59] <+valkuma> mr. Patrick how big is your television
[3:30:02] <twitchyal> Pat if you where a chocolate, what chocolate would you be?
[3:30:02] <Basch71> cave's haunted
[3:30:05] <SomersaultJustice> now fight these native american spirit ghosts
[3:30:09] <anAngryHamster> I'm gonna have you all risk your lives as a roundabout way to admit I've been making my grandson live a lie
[3:30:10] <iaraCatunda> who did pat go on the date with???
[3:30:15] <FirearmsInstructor> CRAZY talk
[3:30:18] <%dheng1> It’s a spooky ghost
[3:30:21] <leargo> you can go 100 hours if you are bad navigatig like me, they say you can do it in 30 hours if you skip all side quest
[3:30:23] <iaraCatunda> in the gold saucer
[3:30:23] <%starotter70> @iaraCatunda Date isn't till later
[3:30:26] <wookie5358> Dolphin blow is better
[3:30:29] <DraxTD> dolfin blow!
[3:30:38] <%Sh00s> Deathblow is good with Vincent's Sniper CR weapon
[3:30:42] <twitchyal> I can't believe this is live, it's good to know Pat is still living, and not taken out by all dat redbull.
[3:30:52] <+valkuma> Dolph ziggler blow
[3:30:55] <foxhounder29> the biggest lie in human history is everyone says their favorite final fantasy is the best one. mystic quest deserves a remake more than 7. Kappa
[3:31:01] <HisEvilDomain> Does he know the trick with the boss?
[3:31:03] <TimetodiveLTX> make these tormented earthbound souls GEDDAN after you punch em
[3:31:08] <LandOfTheWay> "deathblow" always makes me think of that one song from MadWorld
[3:31:11] <poweruser> any move called death blow should either kill the opponent or backfire and kill the user
[3:31:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the phoenix down?
[3:31:18] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat I think if death blow gets max level, it hits a lot more. The problem is..... getting death blow to max level without jumping off a bridge
[3:31:19] <twitchyal> Guys the best Final Fantasy game is obviously THE LEGEND OF DRAGOON!!!
[3:31:19] <iaraCatunda> do characters with guns need long range materia??
[3:31:31] <nocorpse> I am new here. He has Vincent and the Ninja girl already?
[3:31:35] <%starotter70> oh
[3:31:37] <+OkamiDude15> @iaraCatunda nope
[3:31:40] <alrobot2014> oh no the memory is going
[3:31:40] <%D33TR> its undead so thats all you need to know
[3:31:41] <FirearmsInstructor> Trick may have been patched out.
[3:31:41] <%Keyd00d> wait really
[3:31:42] <%NovaKnightmare> 2 words: Phoenix down
[3:31:43] <wookie5358> This is my favorite, but I still think 6 deserved a remake more than 7
[3:31:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> use a phoenix down on the boss
[3:31:47] <%dheng1> Just ninja girl coming up on Vincent
[3:31:51] <%BigManLugan> @angriestpat no hp plus materia purchases?
[3:31:51] <%arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat How many times did you say youve played this game??
[3:31:53] <%supercasualboom> The best Final Fantasy is Spirits Within
[3:31:54] <%zamzoph> @AngriestPat you don't remember RedXIII's backstory dungeon?
[3:31:59] <darcfowler1995> that's actually kind of cool the way the animation looks it looks like red is transforming into him
[3:32:01] <wookie5358> I'll gladly take my 7 remake, though
[3:32:02] <MildMannered> I remember this place and the Wutai side quest being so difficult...
[3:32:03] <%AncelDeLambert> fun fact about the boss of this area that I will tell you all after Pat beats him
[3:32:13] <iaraCatunda> @okamidude15 lmao okay good I've been playing under that assumption
[3:32:16] <twitchyal> @AngriestPat Would you agree that The Legend of Dragoon is the best Final Fantasy?
[3:32:17] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> but how times did you beat it
[3:32:18] <darcfowler1995> like he's doing a big old digivolve
[3:32:27] <HisEvilDomain> you can use an item to 1HKO the boss, can tell you if you want
[3:32:28] <lotharrio> I remember it, because I got stuck here.
[3:32:32] <PortableBoredom> So Alucard for Vincent, and Naruto for Yuffie. Or does he have them already
[3:32:33] <%rytyoung> rytyoung subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hey Pat! This is probably a very late subversary message but whatever! Will you stream Astral Chain, or is that a Pat time game? Keep playing them games, and drinking them Redbulls in a controlled manner!
[3:32:33] <iaraCatunda> EIGHT TIMES? The full game?m
[3:32:36] <nocorpse> Final Fantasy VII, the game that should never be remade
[3:32:37] <%arcaderabbit48> The best Final Fantasy is 14, because its literally every Final Fantasy and more
[3:32:39] <jaid251> I think you use a xpotion on the boss
[3:32:41] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Are those fucking zobies of red's ancestors?
[3:32:49] <%Keyd00d> that game is cool
[3:32:55] <ape_hawk> guys, Blue Dragon is the best final fantasy
[3:32:56] <LandOfTheWay> chrono trigger is the best final fantasy
[3:33:00] <wookie5358> Chrono Trigger is probably Pats favorite FF
[3:33:00] <+ahdurian> guys we all know Blue Eyes White Dragon is the best Final Fantasy
[3:33:06] <darcfowler1995> Legend of Dragoon and legend of Legaia are some good shit
[3:33:07] <twitchyal> I came here to shit and post, and I am all out of posts.
[3:33:09] <%arcaderabbit48> @Bane_Kaikyo Zombie ghosts of the opposing tribe that attacked his ancestors
[3:33:11] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat can pronounce Gi but he can't get "Mako" right?
[3:33:12] <%Mekhet09> that game is lame. legend of dragoon did not age well at all.
[3:33:13] <RupanSen> @arcaderabbit48 sounds more like a big clusterfuck
[3:33:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Xenogears is best Final Fantasy
[3:33:18] <nocorpse> NoCorpse is the best Final Fantasy
[3:33:18] <lotharrio> Chrono Trigger, Xenogears and Devil May Cry are the best Final Fantasies.
[3:33:18] <FirearmsInstructor> .... wait what just happened??!?!
[3:33:19] <iaraCatunda> man can you believe a whole disc in the remake is gonna be just midgard????
[3:33:22] <%Wrashis> gotta cheat
[3:33:23] <SomersaultJustice> Only Street Fighter Alpha 2 can be the best Final Fantasy
[3:33:23] <justafoxhere> Fun fact gang, the Phoenix downs that you can use on the boss can miss! I know because it happened to me 3 times in a row!
[3:33:24] <%supersugoisenpai1> You can get death sentence from these guys
[3:33:25] <FirearmsInstructor> How u do dat? D:
[3:33:26] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> so you're saying they segregated the Gi from the lifestream
[3:33:27] <TimetodiveLTX> cheat more
[3:33:29] <%Wrashis> switch cheats
[3:33:29] <+ImpairedLuoma> just got done streaming MHW Pat, Deviljho is a bitch to capture.
[3:33:30] <SomersaultJustice> SOMERSAULT
[3:33:32] <foxhounder29> all you need to do to piss max off is say ff7 sucks. he'll ban you from his twitch.
[3:33:34] <alrobot2014> i can't blame pat for forgetting things from20 years ago when i can't remember dungeons i played 4 months ago
[3:33:37] <%arcaderabbit48> @RupanSen You'd think that, but every segment is squared away in its own little box so its not nearly as messy as you'd expect
[3:33:37] <%starotter70> Parasite Eve is the best Final Fantasy
[3:33:50] <%supercasualboom> The best Final Fantasy is Breath of Fire III
[3:34:02] <shiny_prinny> tifa has to get kills
[3:34:09] <lotharrio> Probably needs a class change.
[3:34:09] <+ahdurian> let her murder
[3:34:09] <%starotter70> ^
[3:34:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you're supposed to have her get kills
[3:34:11] <SomersaultJustice> you have to let tifa get kills
[3:34:11] <%arcaderabbit48> Tifa must murder more
[3:34:29] <%starotter70> She needs blood on her hands
[3:34:32] <+ImpairedLuoma> you should prepare for iceborne!!
[3:34:34] <rytisone> blood for the titty godess
[3:34:36] <%DedlokPM> BLOOD FOR THE MATERIA GOD rooH
[3:34:36] <12gagerager> Tifa craves violence.
[3:34:39] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> Her murder boner has not been played with nearly enough
[3:34:41] <HisEvilDomain> 1st stage of each limit bracket is uses, 2nd stage is kills for tat character on that teier
[3:34:42] <MildMannered> I started this game again after watching Pat play it, then I realized why I shouldn't play it after getting Aerith's 3-2 LB before getting to Junon
[3:34:43] <%wsintai> FF VII is the dumb, Dirge of Cerberus is the REAL shit
[3:34:54] <%arcaderabbit48> There's a reason REDBULLXIII has a Limit Break called Blood Fang
[3:34:54] <vampireinarm> a real hunter goes in RAW
[3:35:00] <iaraCatunda> I grinded tifas limit I need that suplex
[3:35:02] <%king_wragles> Unless he wants to speed right through it, he's already prepared
[3:35:03] <+ImpairedLuoma> been hunting all day on my stream, Deviljho is a pain
[3:35:09] <SomersaultJustice> look at that ramuh face
[3:35:20] <PortableBoredom> It's like the old saying goes: "You can't learn to do sick combos until you've punched a demon house to death"
[3:35:21] <%DedlokPM> He has until what, January or February to prepare
[3:35:23] <+zackalan> Has pat gotten to the point where Aeris dies or is that still a spoiler KappaHD
[3:35:24] <FirearmsInstructor> @MildMannered the grind is real
[3:35:37] <%Sh00s> LOL
[3:35:37] <%Keyd00d> LUL

[3:35:47] <ministarbury> jeeez
[3:35:49] <%dheng1> Pat gonna grind offscreen for the limits
[3:35:50] <leargo> I know you joke but Dirge of Cerberus is fun
[3:35:52] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Protip ;)
[3:35:52] <+ImpairedLuoma> all I can do is smash Deviljhos in the face
[3:35:52] <HoldBtoRun> you can walk on that oil tho Pat
[3:35:52] <SulfurousAcid> and this time you don't have your strategy guide
[3:35:57] <twitchyal> @AngriestPat This is going to sound weird but you have the eye shape that a lot of people in my Family have, a chunk of which live in Kentucky near Plague.
[3:36:14] <+NlghtSprites> gtiJim
[3:36:18] <HoldBtoRun> ooh I love added effect

[3:46:28] <HisEvilDomain> stingbomb is proportional to current HP don't panic
[3:46:32] <$realm_forge> Pat on acid would be Akira exept instead of the apocalypse everything would be rearranged at right angles and permanently disinfected
[3:46:40] <+ImpairedLuoma> @angriestpat so the other day I left two jars of mayo outside and they both went bad. I said to myself well it's a great day for tuna and I made myself a sandwich.
[3:46:45] <leargo> cave,left, down
[3:46:51] <%supercasualboom> The final they call Sting
[3:46:52] <%rytyoung> Acid: the drug that changes your life forever, or the drug that changes your life FOREVER
[3:46:52] <arkv01> boy it sure hits hard though
[3:46:54] <%Keyd00d> this crazy cave is just right next to town

[3:47:27] <KaliasTV> That better not be like that in the remake
[3:47:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I think it returns mp?
[3:47:40] <%supercasualboom> That spider was the one that scared Paige weeks back
[3:47:44] <%wjones0415> it also gives back HP and MP on kill
[3:47:54] <%AbnormalVoid> right in the bootyhole
[3:47:59] <%SamuraiWes> cheer300 Keep up the good work. Looking forward to more FF7.
[3:48:02] <%rytyoung> @twitchyal this is all from experiences I've been told from people, don't think I could take it myself
[3:48:06] <%Keyd00d> but baba
[3:48:12] <%connos_procrastination> This sword is just a big knife
[3:48:13] <%logoth_> turn off random encounters until you figure it out
[3:48:15] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Further up, nearer the top
[3:48:17] <%starotter70> Hug either the left or right wall
[3:48:19] <TimetodiveLTX> just disable enemy encounterz
[3:48:23] <+ImpairedLuoma> use your brain pat, not your fingers

[3:48:39] <%DonatelloJose> Aren’t all swords just big knifes?
[3:48:40] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, hug a wall, you'll find the opening in the tunnel
[3:48:40] <%seylumiue> Baba doesnt like that
[3:48:44] <+Carpe_Deez_Nuts> True way to play FF7 is no random encounters and lvl99 cheat
[3:48:46] <%logoth_> Yeah we all know how much you hate cheating.
[3:48:47] <EuropanLamprey> You cheated 10 minutes ago
[3:48:47] <+Ilpala> big cheat
[3:48:49] <%Keyd00d> every rpg should have that, like BD
[3:48:49] <+BlackfyreRoy> Imagine getting slashed by that buster sword, and before dying a horrifying bloody death, you get turned into a frog, just to add insult to injury.
[3:48:51] <%AncelDeLambert> good ring

[3:50:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> FF8 is better the second time around
[3:50:14] <iaraCatunda> just start ff12 when you're done

[3:50:18] <%Ranryu692> bring back Sinking City
[3:50:25] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> FF6 would be a move
[3:50:25] <darcfowler1995> Final Fantasy 1 would actually be really good

[3:59:58] <%ColonelRozum> FailFish

[4:03:11] <%supercasualboom> @peachsaliva You revived Yang and you never came back and now everyone in your FF4 is dead.
[4:03:11] <leargo> the Internet hates you now
[4:03:11] <%genowyn> What about MYSTIC QUEST
[4:03:11] <darcfowler1995> I had fun in 13-2 but it shouldn't have happened
[4:03:13] <%rdark_ksu> I've just never played any and i'll keep it that way to avoid these kind of convos
[4:03:14] <+RushUnplugged> "15 is bad" -"did you play it" -"no" EVERYONE WHO SAYS IT
[4:03:15] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Yeah hold x
[4:03:15] <%AllyBeeBoo> i loved 15 :(
[4:03:17] <OldDarkwraith> @AngriestPat Yo the food in that game tho
[4:03:17] <iaraCatunda> the boys were good
[4:03:17] <+Aeogard> What does paige think of Shadowbringers
[4:03:18] <SomersaultJustice> what about aranea?
[4:03:19] <%Ranryu692> @AngriestPat I know she's not, but is Paige drunk?
[4:03:20] <darcfowler1995> 15 is pretty good
[4:03:22] <iaraCatunda> fuck off
[4:03:25] <alrobot2014> is Yang still undead?
[4:03:27] <DraxTD> it had Sid the woman
[4:03:27] <%arcaderabbit48> Its an interesting system, but the enemies dont react at all when you hit them. It feels very limp
[4:03:28] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> bois night out
[4:03:29] <%seylumiue> The magic sucks though lol
[4:03:32] <RupanSen> cute boys doing cute things
[4:03:34] <AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat did you play the Royal Edition of 15
[4:03:34] <%connos_procrastination> how bout them decals
[4:03:34] <%Aeoneth> 15 had Aranea
[4:03:36] <+imthinkingdarbys> I liked 15 but it was certainly disappointing
[4:03:36] <iaraCatunda> ffxv2
[4:03:37] <%starotter70> Dude
[4:03:38] <%arcaderabbit48> Fuck, it would have been
[4:03:39] <Desertfishing> 15-2
[4:03:41] <rytisone> that would be sick
[4:03:41] <alrobot2014> so FFX-2 but good
[4:03:43] <Quigsies> 15-2
[4:03:44] <shiny_prinny> wait why wasn't it just that that's great
[4:03:46] <%Ranryu692> that alone would make it like 10% better
[4:03:46] <%Keyd00d> The Leviathan fight in 15 is one of the jankest pieces of shit "we wish we were Platinum" in a triple-A game I've ever played
[4:03:46] <%arcaderabbit48> Fuck, that is so Final Fantasy it hurts
[4:03:50] <wookie5358> Black Mages Simulaator
[4:03:50] <+Brewstamasta> x2 already did it
[4:03:51] <%Big_Dream> Derge of cerbus
[4:03:51] <leargo> its an incomplete game
[4:03:52] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> sponsored by cup of noodles
[4:03:55] <%ElenaManetta> is FF15 a bad game, everything from the videos looked like a solid game
[4:03:57] <iaraCatunda> can't wait for aranea and Luna in a band in ffxv2
[4:03:58] <+Drigoooooo> That’s 10-2
[4:04:07] <+Aeogard> Doesn't paige like FFX-2? Yuna gun
[4:04:11] <%Mekhet09> does page like 10-2 more than 10? because I do.
[4:04:14] <SpellCatty> the Leviathan fight lets you break the game suuuuper hard because you can break out of bounds and fly literally anywhere
[4:04:21] <+RushUnplugged> 15 is the last game so all the little hater kids say it's bad, like it happens for every single FF game
[4:04:21] <FstSergeant8595> Pat we have the same pants
[4:04:24] <%supercasualboom> Call Captain Mako Planet
[4:04:27] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> 2
[4:04:28] <%arcaderabbit48> @ElenaManetta Its fine. Its perfectly okay. It is an acceptable game that exists.
[4:04:32] <%Owkono> yuna's dress up adventure
[4:04:35] <FirearmsInstructor> Paige looks up for dicks :|
[4:04:35] <DuoScratch> eabLUL
[4:04:36] <$realm_forge> Says you
[4:04:39] <%connos_procrastination> hes too old to play with his dick
[4:04:40] <%dheng1> 10-2 combat was top tier hate the story tho
[4:04:45] <%Keyd00d> little hater 29 year old here I guess
[4:04:48] <@commanderclaw> I can play with my dick while the earth explodes, it adds to the vibrations
[4:04:52] <+solzan2000> 10-2 has better gameplay 10 has better story though
[4:04:52] <Birdigalore> So is Bugenhagen floating on a ball or what?
