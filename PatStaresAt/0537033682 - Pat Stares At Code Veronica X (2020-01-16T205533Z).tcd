[0:04:54] <Cosairen> cb2077 getting delayed was the first time I've been happy for a delay
[0:04:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> if this game doesn't take place in riverdale I might be disappointed.
[0:05:01] <bestwaifuritsu> Did Sakurai seriously question why people keep calling Smash a fighting game? LUL
[0:05:03] <thebladeshield> smash or pass?
[0:05:11] <%Nina96> pass
[0:05:11] <LompyArt> Smash is saving a hype character to be the 1st dlc in the new pack to encourage ppl to buy it
[0:05:13] <%Garthunox> @bestwaifuritsu yeah he did
[0:05:16] <jemeralddragoon> Smash is NOT a fighting game. It’s a party game
[0:05:18] <d00med_magus> pass
[0:05:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> smass or pash
[0:05:20] <%passthehanky> i'm happy for most delays

[0:05:36] <muniea3> I can't believe they put Claire Redfield in smash

[0:41:44] <TheSegaDreamcast> Have you seen the original Steve, pre-X?
[0:41:46] <+fingalights> Claire Splash Mountain
[0:41:46] <%mrcelab> Dialog is quiet only
[0:41:46] <mobiusnightshade> When did they put Matt in the game? XD
[0:41:47] <+amiroodude> Why does he talk like that?
[0:41:49] <%MadMatt2099> Did he just do the Avdol tsk tsk?
[0:41:49] <alejandrogccs> CVX might be the most ambitious and difficult remake to tackle
[0:41:50] <Fujiwara_92> MORE
[0:41:50] <majima666> he does sound like a sonic voice actor lol
[0:41:51] <%Animorphimagi> Full LP?
[0:41:53] <oniwahoo> @dasmause I'm pretty sure he is, which makes it so much worse
[0:41:53] <Dragovus> Turn up everything but mute Steve
[0:41:56] <%Owkono> that's not rain
[0:41:58] <nip_nips> STEVE IS BEST
[0:41:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> apatPat
[0:42:00] <%TheMattman1313> You mean Claire is Rain-sexual?
[0:42:00] <Richmond_> My man sounding like jimmy from south park
[0:42:01] <%SwagglesMD> No Shut up
[0:42:01] <+HouseofNonsense> Chris: See Leon?! Do you see what happens ?!
[0:42:02] <npotockiart> BUT STEVE WAS HER TRUE LOVE PAT
[0:42:02] <%Desertfishing> FAATHER
[0:42:04] <QaizerArt> Steve is the reason why Claire became a cat lady and why Chris is trying to get Leon to fuck Claire so badly.
[0:42:04] <Mizaiya> The greatest
[0:42:05] <%SwagglesMD> Steve is the best
[0:42:06] <%patriotrenegade> Nah
[0:42:07] <%AmericanaRed> turn Steve MUTE EVERYTHING
[0:42:07] <StonerStan101> Who is glad Steve never comes back?
[0:42:08] <tank7013> Claire has fucking terrible taste in men. Remember how her other love interest turned out to be a huge piece of shit?
[0:42:08] <$joylent_blue> soory, deown
[0:42:09] <%SwagglesMD> You're bad, Pat
[0:42:10] <%jillvxlentine> yeah but capcom made him that way, hes just a kid
[0:42:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> WET
[0:42:12] <Mizaiya> How could HUNK ever compete with STEVE
[0:42:12] <Abok6> yes, he is
[0:42:13] <%Elemntion> can you not save him like you can with chris or jill in re1?
[0:42:13] <KatabolicRage> Osht, I miss much? looks like he's near the start
[0:42:13] <+fingalights> Steve is the hero we deserve
[0:42:15] <npotockiart> Steve Burnside was a mistake
[0:42:16] <oniwahoo> Steve is the absolute worst
[0:42:17] <%Nina96> the worst ever? or just up there? @AngriestPat
[0:42:19] <+skyheys> bad like MJ or bad like crap
[0:42:20] <BalloniWright> Steve >>> Leon Kappa
[0:42:21] <+AugustHaze> Touch his beans!
[0:42:21] <%Validuntil2077> I cant tell if this game needs a remake the most or if it should be avoided like the plague
[0:42:22] <%Rngiddion> Rngiddion subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 16 month streak! God what if when they remake CVX that Steve somehow ends up cool? True horror
[0:42:24] <$joylent_blue> KatabolicRage yeah he just started
[0:42:25] <%cowardman93> who's worse? Steve or Jake Mueller?
[0:42:25] <TheSegaDreamcast> WESKER PROMISED STEVE WOULD RETURN
[0:42:26] <ohgodscorpions> so what you're telling me is Claire's a shotacon
[0:42:29] <%patriotrenegade> It’s fine. It’s not great but it’s fine.
[0:42:31] <Higaraishi> hey pat,im playing pokemon on the 3ds while watching the stream, whats your favorite pokemon?
[0:42:33] <+fingalights> Wait, his last name is Burnside?
[0:42:35] <%TheMattman1313> Spoooooooooky
[0:42:37] <%Kegeto> he the male verson of Ashley in 4
[0:42:37] <Mishal21S> Remake if CVX will fix Steve
[0:42:38] <+Remery_> don't be afraid of Steve, Pat
[0:42:38] <npotockiart> yeah
[0:42:40] <Mishal21S> Of*
[0:42:41] <Mizaiya> Its Burnside
[0:42:43] <%AncelDeLambert> Can this chiyald continue the Redfield line? Has Chris asked him yet?
[0:42:43] <+Grayhammatter> spooky
[0:42:46] <%asgard147> If Capcom remakes this game, steve BETTER be WAY less annoying
[0:42:48] <+thotacon_tv> Leon you have to further the Redfield bloodline before that twink steve ruins it!
[0:42:49] <StarlitStunner> doogSherlock Emlo doogWatson
[0:42:51] <%necrocannibal2> why was that zombie moonwalking while sleeping?
[0:42:57] <DaBigVitus> Did this come out before 3?

[0:43:41] <+amiroodude> Brutal
[0:43:41] <%patriotrenegade> I WAS PROMISED AN ALBINOID
[0:43:43] <oyyzzo> BibleThump
[0:43:44] <%blaggablag> That's some high octane dog gutting animation
[0:43:45] <BalloniWright> Pat, you just wanna see Remake Steve Kreygasm
[0:43:45] <%jillvxlentine> you fucked up the events pat!
[0:43:45] <npotockiart> The only think that should come back from code veronica is the knife
[0:43:47] <%Shadowpint> I love this game's music at the very least
[0:43:51] <%incredibleCrayon> No more remakes
[0:43:53] <xanderfist> this game is so dark
[0:43:55] <%AmericanaRed> Knife "noises"
[0:43:56] <+AugustHaze> Make it better
[0:43:56] <Mizaiya> You mean useful?
[0:44:02] <majima666> this game does have an awesome save room theme
[0:44:05] <Arek_1> @AngriestPat Don't you have the PS3/360 Remastered version?
[0:44:06] <+fingalights> Give a more big big knife
[0:44:08] <%jillvxlentine> it used to be darker im pretty sure
[0:44:09] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> remake RE4 but with fixed camera angles
[0:44:10] <+arsentuf> This is the dreamcastiest RE game I've ever seen
[0:44:13] <Richmond_> Does each enemy have a million hitboxes or something?
[0:44:16] <majima666> the 360/ps3 versions are even darker
[0:44:16] <muniea3> MY SHINS
[0:44:17] <%cowardman93> the best thing I can say about this game is it's functioning
[0:44:17] <%segonian> Jesus. that was actually brutal
[0:44:19] <%patriotrenegade> That’s a floaty ponytail
[0:44:22] <oniwahoo> CVX Remake: Not only is the knife multihit, it has unlimited range
[0:44:23] <KatabolicRage> it should be, it was released on dreamcast
[0:44:25] <majima666> like too dark dark
[0:44:25] <npotockiart> code veronica was a dreamcast game
[0:44:26] <armandolorian> *PETA knocks at Pat's door*
[0:44:26] <%bluebiscuit94> The WALL
[0:44:27] <delta0093> game must of been a pain in the ass to see on a crt back in the day
[0:44:30] <%dukenux> I really appreciate how that texture mod made CV look like garbage retroactively
[0:44:32] <bestwaifuritsu> Who has the better knife, X Claire or 4 Leon? LUL
[0:44:32] <npotockiart> but the ps2 port was called x
[0:44:33] <%Rain_Mage> But I believe it
[0:44:33] <+AugustHaze> This is the Dark Souls of RE games
[0:44:34] <rytisone> that lamp

[0:44:51] <ohgodscorpions> strutting around like roberto the crazy robot from futurama
[0:44:52] <%segonian> I'm here for Dreamcast representation.
[0:44:53] <%Rngiddion> like 10 years ago a friend of mine told me, a non RE player, that CVX was the best RE game on PS2. My friend was such a fucking liar
[0:44:53] <%Chichen> THE OLLLLD DICK TWIST
[0:44:53] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> is pat going to use his gun at all?
[0:44:54] <%asgard147> limesS limesS limesS

[0:45:13] <%silverira> OH MYGOD THIS IS A MMA FIGHT

[0:45:22] <ReapandKnow> GIVE HIM THE OL DICK SLIT
[0:45:23] <Mizaiya> Does this have the scene where Steve stares at Clairs ass or is it just Darkside Chronicles?
[0:45:29] <%segonian> Dreamcast controlled better because of the weird joystick.
[0:45:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> give him the old snip snap dick zap
[0:45:32] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> @AngriestPat For RE8 would you like for Ethan to return or have a new character?
[0:45:32] <%FirearmsInstructor> Chat, I hate you because now I know about the ol' dick twist. Fuck.
[0:45:33] <%segonian> it was great
[0:45:35] <oniwahoo> Zombies don't have dicks we saw that already
[0:45:35] <%jillvxlentine> id say go through this area with the knife but past this area dont
[0:45:38] <%cowardman93> I want to point out that this and RE4 exist on the same console
[0:45:39] <delta0093> cant wait till pat starts fighting stretch armstrongs
[0:45:39] <TheSegaDreamcast> Pat, don't forget the explosive arrows for the airplane.
[0:45:40] <%Shadowpint> Why did CVX go back to having to press a button to use stairs
[0:45:42] <%Jane_Lo> @Mizaiya it's only in chronicles
[0:45:42] <rytisone> @Mizaiya Darkside Chronicles

[0:45:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> stench durmstrang
[0:45:59] <%Jane_Lo> @Shadowpint because it was developed along with RE3
[0:45:59] <Mizaiya> Thanks chat, now i know why this game is bad
[0:45:59] <+fingalights> What nerd would know that
[0:46:01] <%cowardman93> cause CVX and 3 were made side by side
[0:46:04] <Mizaiya> no claire ass
[0:46:12] <%Validuntil2077> Oh my god I completely forgot this game goes to antarctica

[0:47:56] <+amiroodude> Claire is too strong
[0:47:56] <%segonian> the load times in this game are stupid short on a GDemu Dreamcast.
[0:47:58] <npotockiart> I aM aLfReD aShFoRd!!!
[0:48:01] <%patriotrenegade> Monsieur Guillotine made his marvelous device to be most humane and painless.

[0:48:34] <oniwahoo> I hope this isn't Chris' blood
[0:48:34] <StonerStan101> @AngriestPat The first one in general is hard.
[0:48:36] <Dragovus> @AngriestPat be sure to leave it on the "Steve is suffering" message for a long long time

[0:49:19] <+el_thag> Nerf The Knife!
[0:49:20] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> he's going to be swimming in ammo by the end

[0:49:23] <%patriotrenegade> Can’t wait to see Pat knife the Albinoid to death.
[0:49:26] <%incredibleCrayon> If they remake this game, leave the knife power but add realistic blood spatter
[0:49:27] <%AmericanaRed> STABY STAB STAB apatDab apatDab_HF

[0:49:31] <StonerStan101> That zombie want that thick Redfield booty.
[0:49:33] <%Desertfishing> hit boxes
[0:49:33] <nip_nips> @Kalcom because you do a bunch of hits per swing
[0:49:35] <oyyzzo> more of a slash, really
[0:49:37] <%jillvxlentine> or they knew this game was hard so left it in
[0:49:38] <+amiroodude> The ol' dick stab
[0:49:39] <%patriotrenegade> Get up in that zombie ass
[0:49:40] <%thegreenbenis> IT'S A BUTTON HOW IS IT LOCKED
[0:49:40] <%D3rrtyD4n> it hits some many times
[0:49:41] <SiegsCorner> resident evil is cool and all but whens dinocrisis
[0:49:41] <%Nina96> its very consistent
[0:49:45] <%D3rrtyD4n> so*
[0:49:45] <+AugustHaze> Is it tied to fps?
[0:49:47] <ShichiNoBushi> That looks like multiple hits per swing.
[0:49:48] <tripessolides> oh no this bullshit
[0:49:49] <SMuffinMan> REmake is piss easy actually, even the invisible enemy shit is easy.
[0:49:49] <bestwaifuritsu> This fucking part
[0:49:50] <majima666> fuck this box
[0:49:51] <%Mendin> Imagine if we ever got an RE x Parasite Eve crossover
[0:49:53] <thedank> Dinomake when?
[0:49:54] <%spongeofmystery> It's this thing!
[0:49:54] <AfricanizedBees> The entire thing is poorly programmed.

[0:50:00] <%Desertfishing> how can claire fit her balls in there
[0:50:00] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I think it hits multiple hits per swing, since they have multiple collision points, but it's not supposed to register that way.
[0:50:02] <%Mendin> Just Aya shooting lasers and fire back and forth against Alexia
[0:50:04] <%godzookylives> this such a stupid thing
[0:50:04] <ProfessorLitmus> hey Pat did you know that Balrog in DMC5 turns into those stupid hulk hands from DMC reboot when you use that forward straight punch in sword master style?
[0:50:05] <+el_thag> Oh this bit is fun
[0:50:05] <rytisone> lower framerate to decrease damage Kappa
[0:50:05] <%cowardman93> oh no

[0:50:06] <Funky_Honkey> how crazy will it be in 2030 when people are playing REmake2 in 400fps?
[0:50:07] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> what about her belt?
[0:50:07] <%asgard147> It's a plant Pat
[0:50:07] <+fingalights> Herbs have metal
[0:50:08] <%cowardman93> big spooks
[0:50:11] <ShichiNoBushi> Too much iron in those herbs.

[0:50:31] <%cowardman93> they thought of 3D printers back then
[0:50:32] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> what if Claire had a metal implant? her journey would end right here.
[0:50:36] <regabt> 3d printer predicted
[0:50:40] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @AngriestPat Becareful with those safety boxes, you can permanently lose your shit in them.
[0:50:41] <majima666> this was the first time i had ever heard of a 3d printer

[0:51:14] <%necrocannibal2> what
[0:51:16] <+PanicSwytch> @angriestpat What happens if u don't deposit the items?
[0:51:19] <%patriotrenegade> Whenever I see “CVX” I read it in my head as “cervix.” And that’s terrible.
[0:51:19] <%Ixiah> copy her butt
[0:51:22] <zettig> @AngriestPat This seems really similar to RE1/2/3. Why is it a spinoff and not a mainline game?
[0:51:25] <bestwaifuritsu> LUL there are monster pictures on little windows on the printer display too
[0:51:27] <%necrocannibal2> what the fuck were you trying to say?
[0:51:27] <%dukenux> Is that Hunk in the "warning" icon

[0:51:53] <%cowardman93> no! not the cervix!
[0:51:56] <%President_Miyazaki> Some other rounds are there too
[0:52:00] <tdmbr> you missed more grenade rounds
[0:52:01] <+Wablafarga> there was other rounds there too
[0:52:02] <Ipsenscastle> @patriotrenegade It's a clue you have to shoot Nosferatu in his giant exposed cervix
[0:52:03] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @zettig contract with sony forced them to put 3 numbered games on the ps1, so instead of calling it Resident Evil LAST ESCAPE they called it Re3 nemesis, and and re3 became CVX
[0:52:04] <Cosairen> evil cervix is what Paige saved us from
[0:52:06] <arsentuf> Smash that MF Cervix
[0:52:07] <%dukenux> so what does BOW stand for?
[0:52:09] <tank7013> Think I saw more rounds back there against the same wall
[0:52:11] <thedank> (((steiner)))
[0:52:13] <%aeravon> There were more rounds on the table next to the gas rounds

[0:54:07] <father_hill> Was the cutscene dialogue kinda hard to hear on anyone else's end or is that just me?
[0:54:07] <%necrocannibal2> @Dingalow that first guy in the prison is cool
[0:54:08] <Eye_of_Hades> steve is just mad there isn't a hot topic around here
[0:54:09] <%honeyman18> I remember a new grounds animation of the entire games cutscene but not what it was called or who made it.
[0:54:10] <rytisone> no time
[0:54:11] <majima666> capcom got him on the cheap from sega

[0:54:46] <@commanderclaw> She'd send an Email to Leon but he's busy banging Ada
[0:54:47] <%Shadowpint> I would assume Claire knows Jill by now
[0:54:51] <%Jane_Lo> @ShichiNoBushi there is no evidence for that, but we can only assume they did
[0:54:51] <+skyheys> GUYS, RAID AT THE ASHFORD ESTATE. A raid of Shadow Legends.
[0:54:52] <%PlainClothesHero> like wtf email address would she know to send that out to like its not cia@***

[0:55:44] <%honeyman18> poop, that's an awful looking mechanism
[0:55:47] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @Death_by_moogle by fair fight, do you mean abusing the stairs?
[0:55:51] <+el_thag> HCF was in castle version of RE4 too
[0:55:53] <+Dingalow> It forces a player to do a thing they don't want to do, and that's why it's so good
[0:55:56] <+PanicSwytch> What happens if u don't deposit the items?
[0:55:57] <oyyzzo> w00t w00t

[0:59:02] <%cowardman93> you can slowly follow the zombie
[0:59:03] <%necrocannibal2> @Hellarussian but Baba
[0:59:05] <castlerock42> Hey, be nice to the zombies. These are the last ones until RE6.
[0:59:05] <Eye_of_Hades> i think it's only re2 sounds they reuse
[0:59:05] <%dukenux> Nked zombos
[0:59:11] <tank7013> @PanicSwytch That would be cool
[0:59:16] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> he's going to run low on healing items in exchange for ammo
[0:59:17] <$joylent_blue> they're getting stronger
[0:59:20] <%cowardman93> someone went round and dick twisted all these naked zombies
[0:59:21] <Ipsenscastle> good trades
[0:59:23] <$joylent_blue> more resistant to a KNIFE
[0:59:24] <+el_thag> How about Billy returning? Even a mention Capcom?
[0:59:24] <+Spoon_fresh> chomp
[0:59:29] <oniwahoo> Adaptive Difficulty!
[0:59:32] <ProfessorLitmus> this wouldn't have been a problem had he made another knife and had gone STABS AKIMBO!
[0:59:34] <TurbulencEDrive> the attache case
[0:59:38] <tdmbr> how come the zombies came out the ground?
[0:59:39] <%Elemntion> wouldnt the rain put that fire out
[0:59:40] <%Psych_man13_13> Man, RE8 should bring back Wesker and Jake so they can have a big dumb anime fight
[0:59:41] <%black_pariah> how does the canon explain these fresh out the grave corpses?
[0:59:42] <%Validuntil2077> Billy got eaten by dogs in the wood probaly
[0:59:45] <muniea3> she could have just used a stick or something
[0:59:46] <%incredibleCrayon> Footsteps sound like snack chips
[0:59:46] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> fire bad
[0:59:46] <majima666> capcom : billy died on the way home, the end
[0:59:52] <trulythedude> bad game
[0:59:58] <+Spoon_fresh> @majima666 LMAO
[0:59:58] <ohgodscorpions> wow look at them graafics
[0:59:58] <majima666> but nah, in all seriousness billy was cool
[1:00:00] <%dukenux> Endless gas leak
[1:00:03] <dredshift> RE8 should secretly be Dino Crisis 4
[1:00:03] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> When are you unlocking the bipod attachment for your knife?
[1:00:03] <Tyrimat> Can you rank all the Re games best to worst?
[1:00:07] <%Nina96> Did ff7r get delayed so that u will finish the original on stream in time?
[1:00:13] <+fingalights> So how do the zombie in this game work?
[1:00:15] <dredshift> And it leads into the disaster that causes Monster Hunter
[1:00:23] <%necrocannibal2> stop beatboxing at me
[1:00:24] <djazo> @angriestpat are going to use the green herp glitch?
[1:00:28] <%linSP> not minecraft steve, but this steve for smash
[1:00:32] <Hellarussian> why is Pat so bad at the words?
[1:00:34] <$joylent_blue> Jake should fight Wesker and do a DDT on him
[1:00:37] <Ipsenscastle> DS
[1:00:38] <+el_thag> Thingos?
[1:00:41] <%Validuntil2077> I feel like billy kinda stole rebeccas thunder though. 0 was supposed to be her game
[1:00:47] <oniwahoo> What is the likelihood that Pat leaves something important in the metal detector when he leaves?
[1:00:50] <majima666> steve burnside for tekken 7
[1:00:52] <+fingalights> Code Veronica Steve for Smash is a must
[1:00:54] <%jillvxlentine> it imitates metal
[1:00:55] <rytisone> vibranium?
[1:00:56] <tank7013> I know it'll never happen but man do I hope they bring back Paul Mercier for Leon eventually
[1:01:00] <oyyzzo> steve sideburns
[1:01:00] <Kalcom> metalic plastic
[1:01:01] <%spongeofmystery> @oniwahoo the magnum somehow
[1:01:01] <%asgard147> PLASTIC METAL limesPoggers
[1:01:05] <%Jeemukun> ah fuck Christopher Tolkien passed away today, someone get the pointy sticks to keep people way from the film rights
[1:01:06] <%JJCheeker> It's a shaped memory alloy
[1:01:09] <%dukenux> Plastasteel?
[1:01:13] <+el_thag> Memetic Poly Alloy
[1:01:13] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Steve for Tekken 7 so that I can German Suplex him
[1:01:14] <FireStarder> @oniwahoo i do every fucking time
[1:01:15] <%dukenux> Polished with woodoo hide?
[1:01:18] <+fingalights> You're laughably small
[1:01:20] <%Elemntion> it looks like metal, feels like metal, acts like metal but that shits plastic
[1:01:28] <%jillvxlentine> true but you do come back later
[1:01:28] <Hellarussian> its made from Woodoo hide
[1:01:31] <djazo> if they remake cvx give me the option to shot steve at the start
[1:01:32] <oniwahoo> @spongeofmystery That'd be incredible
[1:01:35] <laserbeaming> Is this the first fully 3D RE game_
[1:01:36] <laserbeaming> ?
[1:01:38] <%stoccton> pp
[1:01:41] <ohgodscorpions> if it aint metal it aint shit bruh
[1:01:45] <ProfessorLitmus> imagine how much busy work Clair could have saved herself from had she just broken that metal detector
[1:01:49] <%D3rrtyD4n> apatGib apatGoblin
[1:01:49] <%Jane_Lo> @laserbeaming yes
[1:01:49] <+SpoonDawg> army base and palace are small? WHAT?
[1:01:51] <%asgard147> limesAw apatWink
[1:01:55] <SMuffinMan> RE4 is small early game
[1:01:56] <regabt> 3D printer time only have to wait 8hours for this print
[1:01:56] <majima666> did this come out before survivor?
[1:01:57] <+el_thag> Ceramics thou
[1:01:59] <BrocktopusRah> Hear me out... code Veronica remake for smash
[1:02:01] <mishiryu> WOAH ITS CV AND CLAIRE HAS A HUGE BUTT IN HIGH RISE JEANS SUDDENLY YES
[1:02:01] <majima666> that was fully 3d
[1:02:02] <%necrocannibal2> Christopher Tolkien died
[1:02:08] <%jillvxlentine> DONT DO THAT
[1:02:10] <majima666> as for mainline games, yeah
[1:02:10] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat Pat, you're going to run out of ammo at this rate.
[1:02:12] <%Guardiansaiyan> @necrocannibal2 what?!
[1:02:15] <+Dingalow> This whole beginning part of the game has three door sound effects and it is infuriating
[1:02:20] <oniwahoo> @djazo The first mod made will hopefully mute him and render him invisible
[1:02:28] <npotockiart> oh god remember the bandersnatch
[1:02:47] <JDebss> getting your ass chewed out though
[1:02:47] <%VritraReiRei> Knife Only Run PogChamp
[1:02:48] <GhostAnimals> Happy birthday Pat!
[1:02:48] <%Chatterbox1991> I can confirm
[1:02:48] <oniwahoo> The bandersnatch and Nosferatu were something
[1:02:49] <ohgodscorpions> the knoife
[1:02:50] <%jillvxlentine> definitely the best in this early stage
[1:02:51] <MahoganyWoods> Fuck with the Wifey? You get the Knifey
[1:02:54] <djazo> @oniwahoo no i want to hurt him LUL
[1:02:54] <+albedo455> when CVX come to steam....
[1:02:54] <majima666> you would think they would have fixed that shit when porting it to the ps2
[1:02:55] <xanderfist> even bandersnatch
[1:02:59] <oyyzzo> was the knife busted in the original code veronica too?
[1:03:00] <%incredibleCrayon> Is it a frame rate thing?
[1:03:01] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> oh they're definitely gonna change that, if/when they remake it
[1:03:07] <majima666> they didnt even fix it in the remastered version
[1:03:08] <sweetbeanamin> Pat you got me on theMonster Train and now I have a milk gallon full of green monster help
[1:03:08] <%dukenux> Claire needs to kill fast, BUT BULLETS TOO SLOW
[1:03:09] <+fingalights> Pat likes knifes, which is why he likes Code Veronica
[1:03:10] <%VioletHeart> VioletHeart subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 1 month streak! I forget, is this the bad one?
[1:03:14] <ohgodscorpions> now THATS a weapon
[1:03:15] <%black_pariah> Pat, how does the canon explain these fresh out the grave corpses?
[1:03:16] <+amiroodude> Is this the one where the item boxes aren't linked?
[1:03:18] <%necrocannibal2> @Guardiansaiyan yeah I just saw it
[1:03:22] <rytisone> when will we get a katana in RE?
[1:03:26] <+creamandsugar> no knife run
[1:03:35] <oniwahoo> They don't
[1:03:39] <%Validuntil2077> Apparently it was revealed that Wesker survived the events of re5 in Umbrella Corps, which is a canon entry
[1:03:42] <%MoralCompassGaming> I can't wait to quit this job, The Crimetown QA house is just as shit as it's ever been.
[1:03:42] <trulythedude> more like code bore-onica x
[1:03:43] <+fingalights> yeah>?
[1:03:44] <+albedo455> RE2R was easy knife only
[1:03:45] <Hellarussian> oh whoops
[1:03:48] <%SwagglesMD> Just say the Wesker Force, Pat
[1:03:48] <mishiryu> What version is pat playing?
[1:03:51] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @VioletHeart yes and no, worse of the classic bunch, one of the better ones over all. It just misses some of the shit re3 added and its REALLY LONG
[1:03:52] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @Validuntil2077 explain further
[1:03:53] <MoonObscure> atpCap
[1:03:53] <%AmericanaRed> GAS GAS GAS
[1:03:55] <%necrocannibal2> take your time
[1:03:57] <BrocktopusRah> Claire: CQC huh?
[1:03:57] <oyyzzo> ps2 port
[1:03:58] <+el_thag> It’s probably a clone Wesker
[1:03:59] <+fingalights> On dead bodies?
[1:03:59] <Clu_Flynn> uhhhhhhhh
[1:04:00] <EvanAlmighty210> Is this game getting a remake as well?
[1:04:03] <sweetbeanamin> Juiced out is now a verb
[1:04:03] <tank7013> @Validuntil2077 Shut up are you serious?
[1:04:04] <oniwahoo> @validuntil2077 Seriously? Incredible lol
[1:04:04] <%Alexisonfires> You forgot to deposit the lighter apatGib 🔥
[1:04:05] <%dukenux> The clothes eating bacteria. got it
[1:04:07] <$joylent_blue> Validuntil2077 SHUT UP
[1:04:11] <Eye_of_Hades> basically the plot to return of the living dead
[1:04:12] <djazo> the lore for this game is the worst LUL
[1:04:14] <+fingalights> Virus works on dead bodies now?
[1:04:19] <Clu_Flynn> uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yeah except the T-Virus doesn't revive the dead rawrThink rawrThink rawrThink rawrThink rawrThink rawrThink
[1:04:20] <%maskofmichael> You're just bullshiting
[1:04:21] <%Validuntil2077> LOOK IT UP GUYS ITS SUPER REAL
[1:04:24] <rytisone> and a achastity belt
[1:04:25] <%spiritofmojave> Wait SHUTUP he is super dead
[1:04:26] <%Desertfishing> stonk windows
[1:04:26] <%black_pariah> let's just say wesker did it
[1:04:30] <AfricanizedBees> The writers forgot that didn't work around this point.
[1:04:34] <%spiritofmojave> that bitch swam in lava
[1:04:35] <%jillvxlentine> im switching to my phone you guys are coming with me to make a smoothie
[1:04:36] <%dukenux> im not surprised honestly
[1:04:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Im back..is pat still a fuck?
[1:04:39] <%TheQButton> It just takes one dog to catch it, and bite one inmate.
[1:04:39] <%mistermastergreg> Just a suggestion, you should read everything in Alfred's voice
[1:04:40] <oyyzzo> next game will have 8 weskers
[1:04:41] <%AmericanaRed> they didn't get their vaccinations
[1:04:42] <AfricanizedBees> The CGI movies make the same mistake later.
[1:04:46] <oniwahoo> Listen the corpses were only "mostly dead"
[1:04:46] <@commanderclaw> This whole sequence makes no sense
[1:04:47] <Hellarussian> yeyeye
[1:04:47] <%dukenux> they wil hold onto Wesker
[1:04:51] <mishiryu> Is this honestly Claire's greatest design of all time???
[1:04:54] <BrocktopusRah> Palpatine was behind it all
[1:04:56] <+FuzzyWuzzy337> hey Pat did they ever undo the bug where you can totally fuck yourself with that security box
[1:04:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OMG CANT WIT
[1:04:57] <%D3rrtyD4n> alfred, the real hero
[1:04:58] <TurtleButter> alfred Kreygasm
[1:04:58] <SMuffinMan> RE3 had bodies coming out of graves in the park
[1:04:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WAIT
[1:04:59] <$joylent_blue> Wesker survived lava the way Kars did
[1:05:17] <%Validuntil2077> Wesker is behind it all
[1:05:21] <djazo> @angriestpat can you list what you hate about the game
[1:05:28] <Hellarussian> "I am all of the Weskers"
[1:05:30] <apricotrot> hi chat, hi pat! just found the channel so don't mind me not knowing what the hell is going on
[1:05:31] <%PlainClothesHero> oooh remake alfred might not be as ridiculous
[1:05:41] <oniwahoo> The Ashford twins are a lot
[1:05:41] <%spiritofmojave> Sheev Wesker
[1:05:41] <majima666> not enough steve
[1:05:42] <+albedo455> too long
[1:05:42] <regabt> this is where i left the knife 10 years ago
[1:05:43] <ProfessorLitmus> Alfred makes a meal out of the scenery in any scene he's in
[1:05:43] <+fingalights> " I'm already HALF Wesker!"
[1:05:46] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Wesker having a hard on like you wouldn't believe is canon
[1:05:48] <mobiusnightshade> @joylent_blue Wesker vs. Kars. Who do you place your bets on?
[1:05:48] <LunarRemix> Steve is awesome, what are you talking about
[1:05:51] <%JJCheeker> There is a s*** ton of backtrackiinn
[1:05:52] <%D3rrtyD4n> controls?
[1:05:53] <oniwahoo> I hate Steve
[1:05:54] <FireStarder> game feels like it goes on forever
[1:05:55] <oyyzzo> steve da best
[1:05:55] <+firmlygraspi1> theyll fix that stuff if they do a remake
[1:05:58] <%FirearmsInstructor> ST3eE3eE3eeEeEve3Ee!!
[1:05:58] <nademonkey1100> wait wasnt it just down pouring
[1:06:01] <%SilverFaustX> flush
[1:06:05] <+PanicSwytch> Gun juice
[1:06:08] <mishiryu> Would CV have been improved by RE3 dodge or no?
[1:06:10] <Saltmeisterr> sup gamers hows the ResidentSleeper ?
[1:06:12] <%PlainClothesHero> @AngriestPat if they do a remake do you think itd be worth it to have a better steve at the cost of a likely worse alfred?
[1:06:12] <rytisone> so you love gravedigger?
[1:06:13] <flyingtentaclemonster> @PlainClothesHero No, we want him to be MORE ridicoulous
[1:06:14] <%jillvxlentine> wow pat tell us what you really think
[1:06:19] <ohgodscorpions> all the weapons are overshadowed by the god knife
[1:06:20] <$joylent_blue> mobiusnightshade Kars is more fabulous, so probably Kars
[1:06:21] <tiaramaki> Man, I was kinda cheap when I played this years ago, doing the shutter exploit to prevent the zombos breaking the windows there
[1:06:22] <%D3rrtyD4n> ye
[1:06:25] <+el_thag> More Ham!
[1:06:27] <%necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat is there anything you like about it?
[1:06:28] <%dukenux> So it's a 6/10 game?
[1:06:33] <+Ml33tninja> The cheap instant kills are annoying
[1:06:35] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Favorite things about CV?
[1:06:37] <%valriot> I blame the Dreamcast
[1:06:38] <majima666> code veronica is the sonic cd of the re franchise
[1:06:40] <CruxAustralis> wait, RE3 is a spin off?
[1:06:40] <SMuffinMan> RE3 is my fave
[1:06:43] <Punisher7771> god danmit pat and your crazy talk cp2077 got delayed
[1:06:43] <%D3rrtyD4n> alfred
[1:06:43] <Meekest> If this is supposed to be a sequel why isn't it called RE3 and why is RE3 called RE3
[1:06:43] <%incredibleCrayon> Maybe it was rushed for a DC release
[1:06:44] <%bluebiscuit94> Guess maybe they like Jill more than Claire?
[1:06:49] <savagedeviljayho> claire's ass
[1:06:50] <+chase959> I caught the podcast and have been terrified to play Iceborne on PC
[1:06:50] <cant_pick_a_name> does cvx have an extra mode where you can play in first person or am I crazy
[1:06:50] <%PlainClothesHero> @flyingtentaclemonster we can only pray he'll be more ridiculous lol
[1:06:52] <FireStarder> @dukenux yeah thats about right
[1:06:52] <$joylent_blue> Knife-chan
[1:06:52] <%Jane_Lo> @CruxAustralis it was SUPPOSED to be
[1:06:56] <%Elemntion> the fucking graboids @AngriestPat
[1:06:57] <CruxAustralis> huh
[1:06:59] <bestwaifuritsu> Did the Spencers own this military base too or did these guys just really like EMBLEMS
[1:07:00] <%chiluzza> OP knife COMBO
[1:07:01] <+toilet_chan> watching Steve die
[1:07:01] <%D3rrtyD4n> lol
[1:07:01] <%goose_attack_almanac> except Leon
[1:07:01] <oniwahoo> The knife is stupid broken
[1:07:02] <+amiroodude> Claire is cool
[1:07:03] <BionicPulga> Still better than re3
[1:07:04] <@commanderclaw> Ada doesn't
[1:07:05] <rytisone> Alfred and Alexia
[1:07:05] <+firmlygraspi1> Alfred is a good villain
[1:07:07] <alejandrogccs> Don't think they're remaking this one, due to law of diminishing return and the fact that this game isn't as beloved as the first three (and 4)

[1:07:31] <%spongeofmystery> Game is 20 years old, come on
[1:07:31] <Mishal21S> RE3 is better than CV
[1:07:32] <%jcflyguy> Shit I forgot about Nosferatu
[1:07:33] <%dukenux> LUL
[1:07:33] <TheSegaDreamcast> Pat. do you prefer the DSC versions of Alexia and Alexander?
[1:07:34] <+firmlygraspi1> Alfred is like Salazar but like 5x cooler
[1:07:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ive only play 0-7
[1:07:39] <mishiryu> 22 years?
[1:07:39] <tank7013> You should be thanking Pat for letting you know that that shithead gets it
[1:07:40] <savagedeviljayho> telling people steve dies is a public service
[1:07:40] <+Mintios> @AngriestPat Do you see yourself doing the Outbreak games on stream?
[1:07:44] <%valriot> @angriestpat Thought about doing a mini Doom marathon on the lead up to Eternal???
[1:07:45] <%SwagglesMD> lmao Spoilers for a 20+ year old game
[1:07:45] <%necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat we wanted to fully enjoy Steve's death
[1:07:48] <oniwahoo> @tiaramaki 2000
[1:07:49] <$Jmann1892> Steve needed to die so that he couldn't taint the Redfield Bloodline
[1:07:52] <+Dingalow> If anything knowing that Steve dies saves the story so you can rest easy knowing he doesn't even get with Claire
[1:07:54] <mishiryu> No wait, 21 years
[1:07:56] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> My favorite Resident Evil is Dead Aim Kappa
[1:07:56] <apricotrot> my only complaint is I wish steve had a more painful death
[1:07:58] <%AliceAstro> tear them kneecaps up!
[1:07:59] <thedank> It's been hinted that Steve isn't even really dead
[1:08:04] <%SilverFaustX> i have no memory of this place
[1:08:06] <Hellarussian> Steve is the key to all this
[1:08:08] <%Chichen> very cool knife only run pat
[1:08:09] <Punisher7771> i wonder if code veronica will get remade as well?
[1:08:10] <Eye_of_Hades> i love dead aim
[1:08:12] <$joylent_blue> does Claire seriously get the hots for Steve
[1:08:12] <majima666> you can knock those zombies over the ledge. which is actually pretty cool
[1:08:16] <Daxalog> bruh....
[1:08:17] <+el_thag> Remember to save ammo for the Tyrant!
[1:08:19] <%spongeofmystery> @thedank Nobody's ever really gone
[1:08:23] <%dukenux> That Dead Aim LP is a classic
[1:08:24] <%Desertfishing> tag teamed
[1:08:24] <MSN04_Sazabi> They should've done to Steve what they did to Ash in KOF
[1:08:31] <$joylent_blue> Claire baby what is you doin'
[1:08:36] <Stygian_Wolf> the knife hits them like a million times in one sweep
[1:08:42] <+Pendragwn> And what'd they do to ash?
[1:08:43] <CassyASG> but RE3 and RE 4 have the same boring enviornments and enemies what do you mean
[1:08:43] <%valriot> Okay, that knife is just straight up hitting 2-4 times per swing sometimes, you can hear it
[1:08:47] <+amiroodude> Thwip Thwip Thwip
[1:08:47] <%Validuntil2077> There's a site called reylonhorror that has an article where it's revealed in Umbrella Corps' Experiment mode that Wesker survived. there's a voice clip and DC Douglas tweeted about it.
[1:08:48] <thedank> Dead Aim and Survivor playthrough when?
[1:08:49] <%AmericanaRed> Claire giving knifies
[1:08:50] <oniwahoo> So many hits in the knife
[1:08:52] <+Dingalow> If anything knowing that Steve dies saves the story so you can rest easy knowing he doesn't even get with Claire
[1:08:55] <%Jane_Lo> @joylent_blue no she doesn't? it's never stated that it is romantic for her
[1:08:59] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Steve is the single most important character in the Resident Evil timeline, he is the key to all of this
[1:08:59] <oyyzzo> love when the totally not bugged knife goes br-br-br-br
[1:09:03] <+phytopath> If Steve wasn’t so bad I could forgive a lot of the other problems in this game
[1:09:10] <+albedo455> DOGE
[1:09:12] <%valriot> Dark Souls 2 PC of Resident Evil games PogChamp
[1:09:15] <%spongeofmystery> Imagine watching on security cameras or whatever, just Claire tearing through all these zombies and thinking, "ah no, we're in trouble now"
[1:09:18] <$joylent_blue> @Jane_Lo oh ok, people were talking like she did LUL
[1:09:18] <djazo> @angriestpat when i first played this game before fighting steve i give all my weapons to clair and and i didn't have any weapons to fight the last boss with chris LUL
[1:09:18] <%dukenux> @L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N he's the funnier character they've ever had
[1:09:18] <tiaramaki> This background "music" track is so weird
[1:09:19] <NaturalGear> it's the whirligig saw of RE games
[1:09:21] <+amiroodude> Woah u have a gun??
[1:09:29] <%asgard147> limesPoggers
[1:09:30] <%AmericanaRed> LUL
[1:09:31] <cant_pick_a_name> Steve is the one who kidnaps Ashley in re4
[1:09:32] <tdmbr> It looks so unresident evil like when you just slash away
[1:09:33] <%Jane_Lo> @joylent_blue well, they are wrong LUL
[1:09:35] <Stygian_Wolf> damn he's good
[1:09:36] <mishiryu> The thing about Steve is, this is RE, people are gonna die. Sometimes there is casualties, with no come backs.
[1:09:37] <Kalcom> DUAL WIELD
[1:09:40] <+el_thag> Wait her knife is shooting bullets now?
[1:09:40] <solidoutlaw> I heard there are 2 versions of this game, one with matrix wesker?
[1:09:41] <thedank> Steve is the Jar Jar of RE. He's the key to everything.
[1:09:45] <Arek_1> @AngriestPat @CapcomUSA is showcasing DMC3:SE right now.

[1:09:56] <JDebss> That's not a knoife
[1:09:57] <muniea3> uzi knife
[1:09:57] <%valriot> This is pretty much how I play Titan in Destiny
[1:09:58] <Hellarussian> Steve is a funnier character than we've ever had before
[1:09:59] <%SwagglesMD> Pat, show off the Dual pistols for the folks that don't know about the magic
[1:10:00] <rcand9> people didn't know about the cv x knife???
[1:10:01] <%Elemntion> i saved 80% or more of my ammo by switching to my knife
[1:10:07] <%black_pariah> wasn't there a game where the knife was tied to the framerate? was that the re2 remake?
[1:10:12] <saint_ham> hate dog enemies
[1:10:13] <%ospreyworks> Wow, did CV just crib all its sound effects from 2?
[1:10:15] <saint_ham> :(
[1:10:15] <%FirearmsInstructor> Patrick Boivin: Pupper snuffer pofessionalle
[1:10:17] <CassyASG> steve is hilarious
[1:10:22] <oyyzzo> the x in code veronica x is actually a slash, foreshadowing the knife
[1:10:28] <%Jane_Lo> @joylent_blue but people do actually think she had feeling for him, that IS true, but not the kind people joke about
[1:10:29] <oniwahoo> @rcand9 I don't think I ever used it back when I played this
[1:10:31] <+Mintios> @AngriestPat Does chronicles improve the story of the games it did?
[1:10:31] <%Piemen99> wow that's something coming into stream to pat stabbing a dog

[1:10:38] <armandolorian> *PETA bangs even louder at the door*
[1:10:40] <delta0093> what did cvx add to the base game just more cutscreens?
[1:10:45] <%Elemntion> isnt there a pouch down there?
[1:10:48] <%valriot> NO
[1:10:49] <%vergiIsparda> hey @angriestpat! just letting you know this is my moms fave game. also she says hi!

[1:10:53] <djazo> NO
[1:10:54] <%Alexisonfires> I forgot but how is the knife doing that multiple hits so fast? Is he using a special combo, or is he just swinging the knife and hoping it lands? apatPorgmo
[1:10:55] <Clu_Flynn> no dark side is trash
[1:10:58] <%cowardman93> did the knife in this inspire Dante's use of swords in DMC?
[1:10:58] <Gulpunpun> does Umbrella Chronicles version of the story improve it?
[1:10:59] <%Validuntil2077> Steve is less annoyingly acted
[1:10:59] <+SpoonDawg> Steve's voice is WAY better
[1:11:01] <%SoFarFetched> WHAT A MANSION

[1:11:03] <%LudicrousLemon> Apparently the original resi 3 was cancelled, CV wasnt ever going to be the mainline sequel
[1:11:03] <%necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat are you going to play Darkside Chronicles on stream?
[1:11:04] <ohgodscorpions> i feel like this knife was the inspiration for obscure and obscure 2:the aftermath

[1:15:07] <%todcomod> They said they wouldn't remake 4 but they DID say that Resident Evil 1 was back on the table
[1:15:07] <ohgodscorpions> i prefer my fich fresh not spoiled
[1:15:08] <xanderfist> fish don't live long
[1:15:08] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> I have fluff cat cuddling me right now too

[1:15:12] <+Ml33tninja> But not your kids
[1:15:14] <thedank> spoil your water snakes
[1:15:18] <%valriot> I bet Chris killed Steve to remove the competition for Leon
[1:15:20] <+TungstenViper> also, CV actually NEEDS a remake. they always remake already good games, but never remake those games that have huge potential but were botched. those cowards
[1:15:22] <+el_thag> Hug all pests even aquatic ones!
[1:15:27] <tank7013> @oniwahoo Frogs too for that matter. Especially with fish
[1:15:28] <tiaramaki> My cat hates being hugged. But she does like those side-pats that I started doing after seeing you pet Elmo
[1:15:28] <%spiritofmojave> My cat murders my hands but I still love him
[1:15:31] <Fujiwara_92> 0394
[1:15:34] <+el_thag> Pets fuck!
[1:15:40] <GUNxSPECTRE> PC RE4 doesn't look that bad right
[1:15:43] <%vergiIsparda> @tungstenviper say it louder because you're absolutely right
[1:15:47] <ohgodscorpions> 3490
[1:15:51] <delta0093> a dmc1 remake would be cool as well
[1:15:52] <%Elemntion> honestly though whats a better business move pat, a re4 remake or a cvx remake @AngriestPat
[1:15:54] <%trekkie11041> NTC
[1:15:54] <%Validuntil2077> but no goofy hand animations

[1:15:59] <%asgard147> whole thing pat
[1:15:59] <Fujiwara_92> NTC
[1:16:02] <GUNxSPECTRE> Aren't there mods on PC to make RE4 look decent
[1:16:03] <mishiryu> NTC0
[1:16:03] <%vergiIsparda> @tungstenviper because I love this game but it def deserves and needs a remake
[1:16:03] <+albedo455> gun survivor was most BS in lore nemesis in CVX
[1:16:04] <djazo> LUL
[1:16:07] <oyyzzo> lmao
[1:16:08] <majima666> thats what she said
[1:16:09] <%necrocannibal2> RE4 doesn't need a remake
[1:16:09] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Spoil your tarantulas! They're super pretty and harmless and deserve love even thought they actually have no feelings for you
[1:16:14] <%Validuntil2077> RE4 looks great as is
[1:16:17] <%necrocannibal2> NI-
[1:16:24] <%spiritofmojave> D:
[1:16:27] <oniwahoo> Donte 2 then CVX Remake
[1:16:30] <%todcomod> I want a REmake remake
[1:16:32] <+FuzzyWuzzy337> hey fuck video game keyboards that aren't QWERTY
[1:16:37] <+FuzzyWuzzy337> I can never find shit
[1:16:37] <+el_thag> Honestly I’d love a castle RE4 remake
[1:16:38] <majima666> that hunter SAMPLE seems pretty suck tho
[1:16:38] <Kalcom> nic0
[1:16:41] <+arsentuf> We *got* a REmake remake
[1:16:43] <Kalcom> let's go bowlin
[1:16:44] <majima666> sick*
[1:16:44] <GhostAnimals> Don't spoil your tarantulas. Giant spiders are literal monsters, don't keep them in your house
[1:16:48] <GUNxSPECTRE> Well, Gamecube/PS2 RE4 looks pretty horrendous, but they're not primitive polygons
[1:16:52] <rcand9> which weapon will pat refuse to use in this classic re game
[1:16:53] <%todcomod> That wasn't a remake that was a remaster
[1:16:59] <%thegreenbenis> I want a REREmake
[1:17:01] <%dukenux> Spoil your bats
[1:17:04] <tiaramaki> @GUNxSPECTRE Yeah, I know there's an HD mod that I believe is either done or almost done, and one which makes the game less desaturated (if you don't like the gray-ishness)
[1:17:08] <+el_thag> Remaster of a remake
[1:17:08] <ScreamLord> Bats HATE fire
[1:17:09] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> @ghostanimals They are not, they literally have no reason to attack you unless you give them one
[1:17:09] <TurbulencEDrive> Honestly, with the RE Engine, everygame, even RE1 could be remade and it would probably benefit
[1:17:10] <%Aleate> doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain
[1:17:12] <+arsentuf> Bats can have a little salami. As a treat.
[1:17:12] <%vergiIsparda> @ghostanimals how dare you disrespect tarantulas like this they're just trying to exist : <
[1:17:14] <%necrocannibal2> after CVX they should just start remaking the remakes
[1:17:18] <Malziel> Ah yes, Faid spray
[1:17:19] <%valriot> That's fucking dumb, Bats use echo location
[1:17:22] <TheSegaDreamcast> Can you remember the entire Ashford clan before the paintings remind you?
[1:17:26] <Stygian_Wolf> RE Engine is so cool
[1:17:27] <+FuzzyWuzzy337> also Pat why do you pick up every healing item if you refuse to use them
[1:17:32] <%asgard147> limesThink
[1:17:32] <+Ml33tninja> No, remake was a remake no question
[1:17:33] <+TungstenViper> RE4 with HD project mod is perfect as is. Also re4 is already a good game except the story of course... but that would require just making a new RE so...
[1:17:33] <%jcflyguy> Find Jill!
[1:17:33] <GhostAnimals> I stand by what I said. Nothing that would give you XP for killing it should be a pet
[1:17:34] <%Elemntion> call jill
[1:17:34] <GUNxSPECTRE> Next RE game SHOULD be RE8
[1:17:34] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @TurbulencEDrive I agree.
[1:17:35] <apricotrot> can elmo have a little salami? as a treat?
[1:17:35] <xanderfist> would you kiss a spider
[1:17:37] <djazo> @gunxspectre the GC ver still looks good
[1:17:39] <%D3rrtyD4n> if only claire was the master of unlocking
[1:17:42] <tiaramaki> Gee, I wonder what's inside?
[1:17:45] <%thegreenbenis> I want a Remake of RE2 that doesn't make Clair look like the fucking chick from Hunger Games.
[1:17:47] <%linSP> i love the reengine
[1:17:48] <+el_thag> That sounds made up
[1:17:48] <Fujiwara_92> if 0nly the MASTER OF UNLOCKING was there
[1:17:49] <Hellarussian> use diplomacy to reason with zombos
[1:17:53] <%Validuntil2077> they should just remake all the capcom games in re engine
[1:17:56] <ohgodscorpions> just smash it on the ground that lock looks weak as shot
[1:18:00] <rytisone> use the vase
[1:18:04] <%Validuntil2077> fuck it do DMC2 again
[1:18:07] <%todcomod> Capcom really did say that they would possibly remake 1 again. But the question is...first person or third?
[1:18:09] <oyyzzo> remember the basics of cqc
[1:18:09] <%Darren716> Why does it hit so much?

[1:19:33] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @necrocannibal2 if they remade 6, I'd want them to change EVERYTHING.
[1:19:34] <bestwaifuritsu> D3rrtyD4n oh thank god I thought my fucking PC was dying or something

[1:35:59] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat This card key opens the metal shutters in the Lobby of the Military Training Facility.
[1:36:01] <%passthehanky> honestly RE2R's knife is good even at 60, it just scales with the higher FPS

[1:41:26] <%pan_nochal> it has anti-bow rounds
[1:41:27] <Stygian_Wolf> you are drowning in bullets tho
[1:41:28] <%jillvxlentine> it takes 30 rounds to down like 1 zombie in this game
[1:41:28] <arkv01> well first you have to talk softly toe the bowgun
[1:41:29] <6mrlube9> errrmmm... I was told there'd be a crotch cam WTF???

[1:41:42] <apricotrot> LUL
[1:41:44] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> bow gun is good with claire
[1:41:44] <MSN04_Sazabi> Bogans are usually found in their native habitat the 'Straya

[1:41:46] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> The only ASMR I listen to is "Fighting Gold but Coda is your neighbour and he's kinda sick"
[1:41:46] <TurtleButter> pretty sure it's that one locker room.
[1:41:47] <oyyzzo> find knifegun
[1:41:48] <AutechreTwinAphex> oh yeah - you can't decapitate zombies in this game right?
[1:41:48] <nademonkey1100> pat in slightly asmr mode
[1:41:50] <+freakfullmetal2> @AngriestPat Think they will do a Remake of this game too?
[1:41:50] <%Vikken141> Explosive/enhanced bow gun bolts are good i think
[1:41:51] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Observation Room - Military Training Facility 2F
[1:41:51] <%Jekado> unrealistic the printer would be out of ink

[1:42:25] <%SoFarFetched> I wonder if Claire likes Slasher Horror movies LUL
[1:42:26] <muniea3> not realistic, it printed without demanding magenta
[1:42:28] <AutechreTwinAphex> @AngriestPat are you cheating the game? the knife is this ridiculously overpowered by default?
[1:42:28] <%SuperFineButtHairs> SuperFineButtHairs subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:42:30] <%pan_nochal> the knife, the ultimate bioweapon
[1:42:31] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Wow theres basically no threat in this game...

[1:43:09] <%mrcelab> That LEPR voice..
[1:43:10] <%Kegeto> lol
[1:43:10] <cureneckbeard> Resident Boring
[1:43:12] <%dukenux> it kinda is honestly
[1:43:12] <biomegabear> @AngriestPat You played worse resident evbil games

[1:43:14] <%vergiIsparda> @angriestpat my mother would disagree akdhaksja
[1:43:14] <%SoFarFetched> its so dark
[1:43:14] <ohgodscorpions> nah its greaaaaaaat
[1:43:15] <+Dingalow> Kappa Kappa

[1:43:17] <%Nina96> he broke LUL
[1:43:17] <nademonkey1100> just like my life
[1:43:17] <%Tenchi_G> LUL
[1:43:19] <%connos_procrastination> it only gets worse
[1:43:19] <Jimevera> But they're 3D!
[1:43:19] <Arblaster_> It's better than re2 remake at least
[1:43:19] <FunTruker> Buuuuttttt Paaaat this is da REAL RE3
[1:43:20] <+lilgarbage_> BIG YELL
[1:43:20] <zipfile777> mariaE CUT HIS MIC
[1:43:20] <GUNxSPECTRE> Finally, Pat plays something bad on stream
[1:43:21] <+Dingalow> Yup
[1:43:21] <+CrowGuy> SKIP
[1:43:21] <oyyzzo> feel teh terr0r
[1:43:22] <%Pacifcgrim> gib elmo
[1:43:23] <%spiritofmojave> It's so colorless
[1:43:24] <GUNxSPECTRE> Suffer, like G did
[1:43:25] <%vvitchguy> Totally agreed.
[1:43:25] <%cowardman93> especially when the last game released was RE3 which was a super exciting action romp
[1:43:25] <trulythedude> play re4
[1:43:27] <Fien111> No way, I love.....office and......grey lab
[1:43:27] <Virgil_Valentine> Skip it lol
[1:43:29] <delta0093> play gaiden instead :D
[1:43:30] <$MildConviction> the remake will be great bro don't worry Kappa
[1:43:31] <%dukenux> It only picks up when Steve or Wesker appear
[1:43:31] <%GorboMcDuggins> Oh god, ASMR Pat just sounds like MRE Steve to me. Too wholesome Pat.
[1:43:32] <+amiroodude> Skip :)
[1:43:33] <%Validuntil2077> but mansion rehash tho
[1:43:33] <+HouseofNonsense> The lighting is the thing that really bothers me about CVX. Everything feels so...washed out.
[1:43:35] <tripessolides> don't fucknig skip it
[1:43:35] <prophetdisharmonious> That's what makes it great though Kappa
[1:43:38] <%JJCheeker> Is because it has no fixed camera so they can do pre rendered backgrounds
[1:43:39] <Zekuu69> Yung Pat
[1:43:41] <oyyzzo> grimdark, more like
[1:43:41] <%akumakins> It does kinda look like your walking through alot of generic office buildings.
[1:43:41] <%incredibleCrayon> It is dull!
[1:43:42] <habberdash> this game looks good
[1:43:45] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> But the graphics look good for their time right?!??!
[1:43:46] <%Dementedpenguin> Code Veronica is a memorable classic. Uninspired backdrops. Steve Burnside. Iffy controls. Kappa
[1:43:49] <DestroPrime83> Your just mad cause Dante isnt in smash... *crys a single tear*
[1:43:51] <%JJCheeker> Can't
[1:43:52] <cureneckbeard> 6969
[1:43:53] <devanmuse> would it be better if the knife didn't trivialize every enemy?
[1:43:55] <%vergiIsparda> @gorbomcduggins let's get this zombie into a tray! . . . Nice!
[1:43:57] <AutechreTwinAphex> @JJCheeker well - Devil May Cry had everything 3D too and it looked better than this
[1:43:58] <%Pacifcgrim> Pacifcgrim subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 3 month streak! GIB ELMO
[1:44:03] <%SuperFineButtHairs> PAT ANGRYYY RAWR
[1:44:03] <%dukenux> Was this the beginning of the Brown and Grey Wave in videogames?
[1:44:04] <%SoFarFetched> red skull number
[1:44:05] <regabt> Not dull, covered in a Bio gas
[1:44:10] <GUNxSPECTRE> Pat AngeREE
[1:44:10] <%JJCheeker> Yeah but this is Dreamcast
[1:44:10] <%GorboMcDuggins> @vergiIsparda knows what's up
[1:44:13] <tripessolides> dmc1 didn't look better than this no
[1:44:15] <RichardButt1> game sucks but man the dumb characters don't make up for it either
[1:44:16] <+TungstenViper> that's why it needs a remake bawkThink
[1:44:18] <%jillvxlentine> its 1126 but you cant put it in yet , at least it was that for my game
[1:44:25] <%Aydarkzero> b/c he got the late shift
[1:44:26] <AutechreTwinAphex> yeah Dreamcast is probably limited in what it can do - it basically had a high end late '90s PC GPU
[1:44:28] <%SolidusRex> Code Veronica>>>>>>Resident Evil 0. FIGHT ME
[1:44:29] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> to have this moment?
[1:44:29] <%JJCheeker> Oh wait never mind this is the HD version which is different
[1:44:30] <%cowardman93> you didn't even try
[1:44:32] <delta0093> stretch armstrong
[1:44:33] <rytisone> release meee
[1:44:34] <+amiroodude> SPOOKY
[1:44:35] <%connos_procrastination> the arbys noid
[1:44:35] <PoppinThatPolk> dun duin dun dun dun dun dun dun
[1:44:36] <+swaggopotamus> They certainly lack the amoutn of detail pre-rendered backgrounds had.
[1:44:36] <%necrocannibal2> GOOD JOB CLAIRE
[1:44:39] <%FirearmsInstructor> HIS BLOOD SPELLS OUT THE PASS NUMBER! D:
[1:44:39] <%SuperFineButtHairs> this music is farting at me
[1:44:42] <+NinjaWitaSniper> @AngriestPat Play DEAD AIM you COWARD
[1:44:42] <Fujiwara_92> monkaS
[1:44:44] <%dukenux> So they could have an Aliens reference, Pat
[1:44:44] <+freakfullmetal2> The remake for this will probably be better xD
[1:44:45] <RDknight> he was there to DIE
[1:44:45] <%Elemntion> theres nothing really memorable in cvx like lisa, mr.x, or nemesis. thats why it kinda just faded out of my memory
[1:44:46] <+Grayhammatter> monkaS
[1:44:46] <+el_thag> Hiding from the attack duh
[1:44:49] <%Aleate> What is that picture ruuS
[1:44:50] <%Jane_Lo> @SolidusRex i would fight with you, cause you're right
[1:44:57] <AutechreTwinAphex> to be fair launch PS2 games didn't look better than Dreamcast games, in fact the opposite
[1:44:58] <%vergiIsparda> @gorbomcduggins damn right I do : >
[1:44:58] <%jillvxlentine> its those electric roid things isnt it?
[1:45:00] <%nathandiel> Masterpiece
[1:45:00] <%SolidusRex> It's the ablbinoid
[1:45:01] <+el_thag> Stretchy boi’s
[1:45:01] <regabt> splat
[1:45:01] <%Vikken141> Its the electric parasite thing i think
[1:45:06] <TurtleButter> ACTION
[1:45:07] <rytisone> not the level 3
[1:45:07] <%nathandiel> Albinoid you tool
[1:45:09] <ohgodscorpions> it was born in there
[1:45:11] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> jeez
[1:45:11] <%JJCheeker> Did they update the model from dreamcast
[1:45:11] <%pan_nochal> RULES OF NATURE
[1:45:12] <%SuperFineButtHairs> ACTION SLIDE
[1:45:13] <AutechreTwinAphex> later the PS2 won out but the resolution was always shit on PS2 compared to Dreamcast
[1:45:14] <%FirearmsInstructor> Thats a BAD WAY TO LAND LUL
[1:45:14] <%Desertfishing> almost lost the hand
[1:45:15] <mobiusnightshade> Clearly, you build the room around the bandersnatch. :P
[1:45:17] <srkAres> wooow, shge legged it
[1:45:18] <rcand9> that was close
[1:45:18] <%cowardman93> claire literally did nothing to open the door
[1:45:18] <AutechreTwinAphex> @JJCheeker nah
[1:45:19] <LunarRemix> It looked like she triped.
[1:45:20] <%TheActuallyGuy> its the baby albanoid
[1:45:22] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> got a hat for you to put on, Miss Indy?
[1:45:22] <prophetdisharmonious> She forgot to grab the hat right after it
[1:45:23] <%SuperFineButtHairs> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[1:45:24] <%FirearmsInstructor> Like break your neck and slide on it LUL
[1:45:24] <%jillvxlentine> yeah its albanoids
[1:45:25] <Fien111> THAT SURE IS A GREAT SOUND TO ENDLESSLY LOOP
[1:45:28] <%GarbageNirvana> Clayer
[1:45:28] <oyyzzo> better than a few re cg movies
[1:45:32] <nademonkey1100> BEEP BEEEP BEEEEP
[1:45:34] <%dukenux> hmm
[1:45:37] <%SolidusRex> Not a bandersnatch, albinoid
[1:45:39] <majima666> yeah, the dc was a capable machine in some places
[1:45:41] <+professormorrigan> moooo
[1:45:42] <%Elemntion> its just a big dumb island with incest twins banging and accidentally releasing their fucking zombies
[1:45:44] <%spiritofmojave> looked like she just fucking threw herself down the stairs head first unintentionally LUL
[1:45:44] <%Validuntil2077> Thats a reeally good 3D model for 2000
[1:45:49] <tiaramaki> Gotta be honest, I thought it was the bandersnatch, too, when I played this
[1:45:50] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Wow what a great zombie sound
[1:45:51] <graemecrackers1> beep
[1:45:52] <rytisone> time for a Claire shower scene
[1:45:52] <%necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat what are the chances of you playing Darkside Chronicles, Dead Aim and Outbreak on stream?
[1:45:52] <AutechreTwinAphex> the PS3/360 versions of this game received dynamic lighting and some other tech bumps but that was about it
[1:45:55] <%Conyst> Hey Pat not joking just woke up from a nap last thing i remember was second meeting with Steve
[1:46:04] <graemecrackers1> beep boop
[1:46:06] <%nathandiel> Pat hates CVX cuz it’s not prerendered
[1:46:09] <rcand9> what was the death count on 3?
[1:46:10] <Fien111> SHe's had practice I guess
[1:46:10] <%pan_nochal> by now Claire's a badass
[1:46:11] <%FirearmsInstructor> That's a GOOD cadence of fire.
[1:46:15] <+CrowGuy> hahaha remember when there were CIGARETTE machines in buildings?!?!
[1:46:15] <%spongeofmystery> That's a 93R, right?
[1:46:16] <%cowardman93> she learnt to shoot fast ot get Leon's dick hard
[1:46:18] <%FirearmsInstructor> Like with ACCURATE shots
[1:46:20] <+lilgarbage_> Nothing of interest. Just like the environments in this game
[1:46:21] <AutechreTwinAphex> what version is this? the PS4 version - so PS2 emulated?
[1:46:24] <%Validuntil2077> you basically start with the Eagle 6.0
[1:46:29] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> will Resistance be any good?
[1:46:29] <%SolidusRex> Handgun + knife is an unstoppable combo for a good chunk of the early game
[1:46:29] <GUNxSPECTRE> That recoil is ridiculous though
[1:46:36] <%SuperFineButtHairs> just stab em in the knee
[1:46:36] <%jillvxlentine> i think everyone thought it was a bander because you really only the the noids in that room and later when chris has the option to fight one
[1:46:39] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> I'm going to assume everyone already knows that cyberpunk got delayed like six months?
[1:46:40] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> is it?
[1:46:42] <%necrocannibal2> CRAZY TALK
[1:46:45] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> okay it is
[1:46:45] <%SoFarFetched> damn
[1:46:47] <$joylent_blue> the multi-hit sound is so goofy
[1:46:48] <Fujiwara_92> is it?
[1:46:49] <%FirearmsInstructor> GOD I hope he dies here that would be amazing
[1:46:51] <oniwahoo> Yeah
[1:46:51] <%necrocannibal2> okay yeah
[1:46:51] <%FirearmsInstructor> awww
[1:46:53] <zipfile777> They sounds like Quake
[1:46:53] <%connos_procrastination> leon is a chaser
[1:46:53] <tripessolides> yeah it is
[1:46:55] <nademonkey1100> fucking knife OP
[1:47:00] <%SoFarFetched> can hear that multiple hit box
[1:47:03] <%necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat what are the chances of you playing Darkside Chronicles, Dead Aim and Outbreak on stream?
[1:47:03] <AutechreTwinAphex> TBH the game looks better on the Dreamcast - I don't think anything was upgraded on PS2 - PS2 probably runs at a lower resolution
[1:47:04] <%Jekado> thats what i call BIG damage
[1:47:05] <Fien111> That's a fucking progressive knife, there's no other explanation
[1:47:08] <+Shadope342> FUCK YES
[1:47:12] <%Validuntil2077> IT IS
[1:47:14] <rcand9> use the bow
[1:47:15] <%pan_nochal> LUL
[1:47:16] <%BingsAksolum> damn, he killed that guy so hard he flew forward
[1:47:17] <bluefooddye1> It's very powerful, especially against living things!
[1:47:17] <historynutjackson> !uptime
[1:47:18] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 47m.
[1:47:19] <%Zulrez> resident evil knife, truly a weapon to surpass metal gear
[1:47:20] <+lilgarbage_> USE IT
[1:47:24] <GUNxSPECTRE> Krauser Knife GOAT Beast-God
[1:47:24] <Amplificate> Is this an archery training ground
[1:47:25] <A_Family_Man> I hope in RE3 multiplayer you can save up enough points to send like 3 Mr Xs on the players
[1:47:26] <nademonkey1100> more arrows you will never use
[1:47:28] <%Jekado> oh yeah they really push the bow gun
[1:47:28] <%spiritofmojave> so much bogan
[1:47:30] <+A0N33> I hope that bowgun feels goo to use then LUL
[1:47:31] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Fien111 I don't get it
[1:47:31] <rytisone> the best bow guns are in RE4
[1:47:32] <Mr_Pylon> What's bad about the bowgun?
[1:47:33] <Fien111> Pat picked easy mode when we weren't looking, didn't he?///////////////////
[1:47:34] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> gotta showcase all da weapons
[1:47:36] <oyyzzo> biohazard tipped arrows
[1:47:37] <%Jekado> its really bad tho
[1:47:39] <%Aleate> Amazing
[1:47:40] <PoppinThatPolk> HAHAHAHAHA
[1:47:41] <+Shadope342> UNFETTERED POWER
[1:47:41] <%SuperFineButtHairs> oh that worked
[1:47:41] <IndoorSitup> Forgot to ask, is Patricío playing on an emulator?
[1:47:42] <%necrocannibal2> it sucks
[1:47:42] <+lilgarbage_> Oh wait nvm
[1:47:43] <joylent_blue> WOW
[1:47:43] <%PlainClothesHero> wow
[1:47:44] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> oof

[2:05:40] <CassyASG> this game is better than most RE games
[2:05:42] <%mrcelab> Are those Lugers powerfull?

[2:05:51] <%cowardman93> leave him here, forever

[2:05:57] <%spongeofmystery> @dukenux that's exactly how I hear it
[2:05:58] <Ipsenscastle> @dukenux I was thinking exactly the same thing. FAATHERRRRRRR
[2:05:59] <+AXL808> should you really leave him alone here?
[2:06:03] <bestwaifuritsu> Shame the game doesnt give you the option to just put two in the back of his skull and put him out of his misery for being Steve lol
[2:06:07] <%FirearmsInstructor> @traytr GOD DAMNIT

[2:06:22] <%Pigg1yJuffs> @firearmsinstructor I know, I said my part and did what I knew was necessary at least. I just felt worse for the streamer. Cause he was obviously letting it get to him and dragging him down into it.
[2:06:23] <+PalmtopNami> oh look its dog shit in game form.
[2:06:27] <+amiroodude> The jump to RE4 now is even more amazing

[2:06:55] <$joylent_blue> its a metaphor for the tank controls

[2:06:59] <%jillvxlentine> you should go back to the lift
[2:07:00] <+GeoMandrake> least 6 as a kool sherry in it
[2:07:00] <oniwahoo> You know, Steve has really brought us all together
[2:07:02] <rcand9> claire has no blood
[2:07:02] <Xenokhrist> Remake 1 was, what, a year and a half after this? and the jump in quality is unbelievable
[2:07:03] <%Shadowpint> For real though I don't think this game is bad so far, just definitely not as good as other RE games
[2:07:05] <CassyASG> ^ super wrong 6 is trash
[2:07:06] <+CrowGuy> I wonder if that tank has... TANK controls LUL
[2:07:07] <+GeoMandrake> @mobiusnightshade it indeed does

[2:07:58] <%connos_procrastination> tough but six
[2:07:58] <%Shadowpint> wow
[2:07:58] <%SuperFineButtHairs> 6 is dumb action fun
[2:07:59] <$joylent_blue> did 6 at least play well
[2:07:59] <%FirearmsInstructor> @traytr Now I'm going to ask for my burgers with a "slice of swiss milk loaf"
[2:08:00] <%Aydarkzero> if you say Code Veronica over 6 you're insane
[2:08:01] <%Validuntil2077> wow
[2:08:02] <Phantonbat> Fuck off
[2:08:03] <+worthwhile_off> @Xenokhrist I just started playing remake 1 on Dolphin. I walked in a room, heard the roar of a crimson head, did a complete 180.
[2:08:05] <%cowardman93> 6 is at least competent in its shooting and has semi interesting enemies
[2:08:06] <Ipsenscastle> sbfpRed_SG
[2:08:07] <+dheng1> Was that a graboid?
[2:08:08] <A_Family_Man> Validation bitches
[2:08:08] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Wait I remember completing this game now. How the fuck did I forget that
[2:08:10] <+TungstenViper> at least CV is pure. 6 is a fucking travesty. it wants to be everything but succeds in nothjng
[2:08:11] <ohgodscorpions> damn thats not what i expected
[2:08:11] <rcand9> just wait till he gets to 6
[2:08:12] <CassyASG> zero is also worse than this
[2:08:12] <%Maids4lyfe> I thought 6 was hot garbage
[2:08:14] <+TaphexWin> I'll take half of Leon's campaign in 6
[2:08:16] <%Psych_man13_13> this or REORC?
[2:08:17] <%jillvxlentine> only cause there are things happening in like every single second of 6
[2:08:18] <+kringler> This game was way better than 6 no fucking way
[2:08:19] <GUNxSPECTRE> 6 is fucking stupid, but it is fun to play for the most part
[2:08:19] <djazo> 6 has better gameplay LUL
[2:08:19] <rcand9> he will change his mind
[2:08:20] <%42nfl19> I liked 6 and it was a fun bro-op to play
[2:08:21] <natebud> Everyone hype the Albanoid
[2:08:22] <TurtleButter> yeesh, this is a preety bad chat.
[2:08:22] <+goatofdeparture666> yeah he says that now...
[2:08:24] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Nah, I actually liked 0
[2:08:24] <+el_thag> This is anime as fk it’s great
[2:08:27] <tripessolides> @AngriestPat CV is waaaaay shoreter than 6 though
[2:08:28] <%spoonbruh> So how well do you know this compared to the others @angriestpat
[2:08:30] <+Voidwyvern> Voidwyvern subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[2:08:32] <+kringler> tank controls > everything
[2:08:33] <+Dingalow> @AngriestPat Will you be playing the new epic battle royale experience "Soviet Jump Game?" for this channel?
[2:08:34] <%Konquerer> there's too damn much of 6
[2:08:34] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> This game is fucking hilarious what do you mean youd rather play 6
[2:08:36] <AutechreTwinAphex> well at least there is still the classic RE gameplay in it even if it sucks - RE6 so much of the time is just a plain action shooter
[2:08:36] <%pan_nochal> does 6 have Wesker in the Matrix, huh?
[2:08:36] <%Validuntil2077> 0 is fine
[2:08:36] <%FirearmsInstructor> 6 WAS SUPER FUN LUL I played with a good friend and we fucked around the WHOLE TIME and it was SO DUMB
[2:08:41] <%nathandiel> Chris and Piers were lovers
[2:08:42] <+BurkeBigsby> Darkside Chronicles gets the shaft again.... Kappa
[2:08:42] <%Tenchi_G> RE6 is the worst
[2:08:43] <$joylent_blue> yeah but zero has the Billy thumbs-up, that makes it the best
[2:08:50] <%spiritofmojave> Six atleast is not a bad GAME with coop just shit RE
[2:08:52] <+CavemanInCave> dino crisis remake when pat? I know you know
[2:08:54] <+Serprio> 6 has one of the best mercenaries modes because of how great the actiony gameplay is; jake punching and dodging zombos is really fun. campaign sucks tho
[2:08:55] <%spongeofmystery> The Tekken 2 ending
[2:09:01] <TurtleButter> half of the chat has no idea what they're talking about LUL
[2:09:06] <rcand9> 6 is in no way dumber than cv x
[2:09:07] <%NovaKnightmare> NovaKnightmare subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! Hey pat, is it more comforting or aggravating to see a few games in the months of March and April have gotten delayed?
[2:09:11] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> RE6 is very dumb fun with friends. Its nice
[2:09:13] <earthmanbrick> Zombies just want to give you hugs
[2:09:13] <rytisone> Leon campaign is fine for me in 6
[2:09:16] <+amiroodude> 6 is fine as a dumb action game
[2:09:18] <%Mekhet09> THEY RESPAWN.
[2:09:18] <oniwahoo> I really like how Alexia makes Wesker look like a bitch tho
[2:09:23] <%cowardman93> the fixed camera in RE6 improves it a lot
[2:09:24] <+dheng1> I love how they keep the zombos noise from 2
[2:09:24] <%Validuntil2077> 6 is shlock but none oif it is as bad as steve
[2:09:25] <rcand9> cv x is super dumb chat
[2:09:25] <GUNxSPECTRE> Is Pat gonna Co-op the next few games?
[2:09:29] <GUNxSPECTRE> Get Fuggins in there
[2:09:31] <AutechreTwinAphex> @rytisone nah there's so much bad stuff during that campaign - every campaign in fact
[2:09:32] <%FirearmsInstructor> Wasn't FFVIIR delayed?
[2:09:33] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> You gonna try 1st person mode at all Pat? I can't remember how badly it controls
[2:09:34] <prophetdisharmonious> That zombie had knee pads
[2:09:35] <oyyzzo> they should respawn with mounted rpgs
[2:09:35] <+BurkeBigsby> Sound effects are impeccable.
[2:09:40] <+TungstenViper> @angriestpat Pat, you say that only because you know every trick in this game. running blind this is hardcore and actually requires planning your moves
[2:09:43] <%Jekado> no pat will solo 5 and 6
[2:09:45] <rcand9> in this instance dumber = better
[2:09:52] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> @TurtleButter Since when is any chat different
[2:09:52] <%spiritofmojave> @firearmsinstructor Yep till April 16th think?
[2:09:59] <%TheSphereHunter> fuuuuuun
[2:09:59] <djazo> i would rather not to play both LUL
[2:10:01] <natebud> It is not at all.
[2:10:03] <%Pigg1yJuffs> FFVIIR and Cyberpunk were delayed.@firearmsinstructor
[2:10:04] <Captain_Joe1911> carciLUL
[2:10:05] <+amiroodude> This game don't feel good to look at
[2:10:06] <%Aydarkzero> doesn't the knife break that argument?

[2:10:22] <CassyASG> CVX is fine stop overexaggerating
[2:10:24] <+FOGSHIE> How many mainline RE entries are there? 12 or 13 (not including RE3make)?
[2:10:25] <%passthehanky> suzi!
[2:10:26] <%Aydarkzero> why can't i spell
[2:10:26] <%ospreyworks> This game has way too many cutscenes.

[2:10:27] <rcand9> hey its suzy you do great videos
[2:10:30] <%silverira> HI Suzy

[2:10:41] <+dheng1> I love your videos suzy
[2:10:42] <%FirearmsInstructor> No you fucking cant LUL
[2:10:42] <CassyASG> hi suzy
[2:10:42] <%spiritofmojave> thanks :)
[2:10:44] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> This game for me feels like the Star Wars prequels.
[2:10:44] <+TaphexWin> Now to become the master of unlocking
[2:10:45] <%cowardman93> well you see you let me out of my cell for no fucking reason
[2:10:45] <Xenokhrist> Steve is a literal cartoon character
[2:10:46] <%Elemntion> also his gun is out of ammo
[2:10:46] <%Zerodyne90> Suzy rgtLove
[2:10:48] <%connos_procrastination> this guy is hot
[2:10:49] <$joylent_blue> you've literally done nothing to dress your wound, idiot
[2:10:51] <+BurkeBigsby> Leave the man his jar of cum and go!
[2:10:52] <%MayorRev> hi suzy
[2:10:53] <oniwahoo> Steve is rough
[2:10:54] <MSN04_Sazabi> CVX is the worst classic-style mainline title, it's not "fine" by any measure
[2:10:56] <+Arrior_Septem> apatBlep_SG
[2:10:57] <%Validuntil2077> *dies in next scene*
[2:10:58] <%MayorRev> how's your day going
[2:10:59] <%Garthunox> wait is it suzi or suzy
[2:11:02] <natebud> here, take my key item
[2:11:02] <+AXL808> his lucky penny!
[2:11:03] <%TheSphereHunter> Suzi
[2:11:03] <%Aydarkzero> @TheSphereHunter chats having a discussion on what they would rather play Veronica or 6
[2:11:05] <+amiroodude> Why can't that guy be Steve instead
[2:11:05] <%dukenux> now fuck
[2:11:05] <oyyzzo> he sounds fine for a guy bleeding out
[2:11:08] <PoppinThatPolk> Steve looks like he is about to eat a bullet
[2:11:10] <Fujiwara_92> this guy is cool
[2:11:11] <%nathandiel> Holy shit when did we get here
[2:11:12] <%jcflyguy> But the BATS
[2:11:12] <ProfessorLitmus> I can take care of myself, ten minutes later gets eaten by the giant worm
[2:11:13] <djazo> @thespherehunter would rather play this or 6 LUL
[2:11:16] <%necrocannibal2> that guy should be Steve
[2:11:17] <ShichiNoBushi> Here's... a lock pick...
[2:11:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> So I missed the FE generic swordsman #8 reveal shitshow due to pulling my lower back but I'm hear for the Veronica nonsense
[2:11:21] <%Rngiddion> I really wonder how a remake would fix steve, cuz he sure does need it
[2:11:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Boi I'm glad I skipped this one
[2:11:22] <TheGershon> This guy has way more chemistry with Claire than Steve ever does
[2:11:28] <+dheng1> The master of unlocking
[2:11:30] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> *dies*
[2:11:31] <%FirearmsInstructor> jUsT gOo0oO0O0oooo!!
[2:11:33] <%Sartastic> every guy should be Steve
[2:11:36] <%TheSphereHunter> ugh
[2:11:36] <%spoonbruh> He’s basically this versions marvin let’s be honest
[2:11:36] <%connos_procrastination> jail guy is way hotter than steve
[2:11:37] <Fujiwara_92> neither
[2:11:38] <+el_thag> Let’s hope Jill taught her everything she knows
[2:11:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I think this
[2:11:41] <%passthehanky> honestly this... i think it's shorter than 6
[2:11:43] <%dukenux> This guy would normally be pretty cool, but compared to Steev he's a god
[2:11:46] <%Aydarkzero> she's stuck now!
[2:11:47] <%Pigg1yJuffs> So, how long do you plan on playing till @angriestpat?
[2:11:47] <rcand9> im for this
[2:11:47] <Sol_Install> seriously, after seeing you and max and i think someone else playing this. I rather watch 6
[2:11:48] <natebud> 6 has stuff though, this game is the absence of stuff.
[2:11:48] <rytisone> Suzi is sweating rn
[2:11:49] <%Typhaeon> I remember liking this on Dreamcast, but I was probably just young and stupid
[2:11:50] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> @doc_ock_rokc Did you hear cyberpunk got delayed six months?
[2:11:54] <%NovaKnightmare> @AngriestPat Im a bit late, but have you gone over what you dislike about CVX yet?
[2:11:55] <%FirearmsInstructor> Who's suzie?
[2:11:55] <%Archphronimos> Archphronimos subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! How the time flies! Our Sub-Baby is already 4 months old!Oh and if/when able, please pet the baby. thanks
[2:11:56] <GUNxSPECTRE> Yeah, but 6 has the playground set you dweebs
[2:11:56] <%Garthunox> that's an appropriate answer
[2:11:58] <%Typhaeon> Or was it Saturn
[2:12:00] <+BlackIronVengarl> hello everybody
[2:12:01] <%connos_procrastination> id rather have nothing
[2:12:03] <flyingtentaclemonster> Resident evil was vastly improved by the inclusion of subtitles
[2:12:05] <regabt> Anythings better than 6
[2:12:07] <%Garthunox> @gunxspectre goty
[2:12:08] <%Aydarkzero> all i'm saying is re6 seems at least playable
[2:12:10] <%VritraReiRei> Don't avoid the question :D
[2:12:14] <%spiritofmojave> Sometimes nothing is a valid choice
[2:12:16] <%FirearmsInstructor> notkohWave suzie, whomever you are
[2:12:16] <+el_thag> CP2077 is delayed five months
[2:12:17] <%AkronymCLT> 6 has fan favourite character Piers Nivens
[2:12:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> @fruit_pie_the_magician No but i'm not surprised CDPR usually delay for quality
[2:12:23] <djazo> suzi.exe has stoped LUL
[2:12:23] <Mishal21S> CV is way better
[2:12:23] <%passthehanky> @FirearmsInstructor she makes awesome videos on survival horror games mainly resident evil
[2:12:24] <flyingtentaclemonster> 6 gave us girffe blowjob so....
[2:12:25] <%Validuntil2077> 6 at least has a balanced weapon system
[2:12:29] <rcand9> ugh is a valid answer
[2:12:30] <%TheSphereHunter> CV because all of Claire's stuff is pretty good it's only when Chris shows up and you have to do it ALL again is when I die inside
[2:12:31] <%Aydarkzero> CVX has camp which is fine but
[2:12:32] <+dheng1> Piers died for our sins
[2:12:33] <$joylent_blue> FirearmsInstructor @TheSphereHunter is Suzi, she's an awesome youtuber
[2:12:34] <natebud> 6 has karate
[2:12:35] <%dukenux> @FirearmsInstructor Spherehunter, check out her vids on YT
[2:12:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> 6 has Ada tits
[2:12:35] <Stygian_Wolf> he quickly gae claire a hickey
[2:12:38] <%XeroSigmaPrime> 6 IS WAYYYYYYYYYYYYY BETTER
[2:12:39] <%cowardman93> 6 tried harder than this, just a bit too hard
[2:12:40] <%Mekhet09> Has claire ever been in a good game?
[2:12:41] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> You guys are being way too harsh on this game. It's not the worst thing in the world
[2:12:41] <%FirearmsInstructor> @passthehanky yeah but who is it?
[2:12:42] <%Typhaeon> RE6 is just absolute nonsense
[2:12:43] <%Jane_Lo> @AkronymCLT "fan favorite" nah, he's meh
[2:12:49] <%spongeofmystery> 6 has giant, square-cube law violating T Rex man thoughh
[2:12:49] <GUNxSPECTRE> ADA crossbow is pretty awesome
[2:12:49] <%Validuntil2077> there is also ada tits
[2:12:50] <%SoFarFetched> "CV because all of Claire's stuff is pretty good it's only when Chris shows up and you have to do it ALL again is when I die inside"
[2:12:50] <%FirearmsInstructor> @joylent_blue @dukenux ah thank you
[2:12:53] <%AkronymCLT> it was a joke man
[2:12:56] <+kringler> RE6 is easily the worst RE. yall are on crack
[2:12:59] <%SwagglesMD> 6 has Jeff Goldblum
[2:13:02] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> she dies inside
[2:13:06] <%pan_nochal> @AngriestPat I'm sure you talked about Nemesis and REmake 3 at the beginning, wanna talk about him more?
[2:13:13] <%Aydarkzero> i thought RE Survivor was the worst RE game Kappa
[2:13:16] <rcand9> WOOO cv by default the best kind of win
[2:13:16] <djazo> so half of cvx LUL
[2:13:18] <%Validuntil2077> also some of the Ada and Leon stuff is not too bad
[2:13:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SoFarFetched so the DMC4 senario
[2:13:21] <natebud> acid rounds in the basement?
[2:13:21] <+CuddlyKaiju> wow this game looks worse than I remember
[2:13:22] <%trekkie11041> BREIFCASE
[2:13:28] <Ipsenscastle> If they remake this they should double down on making Steve even worse
[2:13:31] <+TungstenViper> Guys. CV is the DMC4 of the REs. think about it
[2:13:31] <Fien111> In the offices near the bandersnatch cutscene
[2:13:31] <theaterunderground> Sherry and Baby Wesker might fuck though in 6
[2:13:33] <Reaganball_Z> Gun Survivor was absolutely vile
[2:13:38] <regabt> Played 6 for 10 mins before putting it back on the shelf forever
[2:13:38] <+swaggopotamus> The color palette in the remastered version of this game is actually kinda woise than the original.
[2:13:40] <%passthehanky> tbh if steve wasn't in the game it might actually be worse lmao
[2:13:40] <%cowardman93> @kringler Umbrella Corps exists
[2:13:40] <GUNxSPECTRE> The 6's Hong Kong level is pretty okay
[2:13:41] <MSN04_Sazabi> Guys, we live in Umbrella Corps timeline, let's not talk about non-mainline titles LUL
[2:13:42] <%pan_nochal> @TungstenViper except DMC4 is good
[2:13:43] <%Desertfishing> claire is the lockpickinglawyer
[2:13:46] <%passthehanky> at least steve is *something happening*
[2:13:46] <oyyzzo> lockapicka
[2:13:48] <%necrocannibal2> Steve should be shirtless in the remake
[2:13:49] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Oh God, all I remember from this game is that fucking bleeping
[2:13:49] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @TungstenViper Fuck off, RE6 is the DMC4 of RE
[2:13:50] <%TheSphereHunter> In RE6 there are very few gameplay scenarios I actually like, and that game also has a lot of shit where the camera has to look at a set-piece when you're trying to play the game.
[2:13:50] <+swaggopotamus> Also the original made better use of shadows for atmosphere.
[2:13:52] <+BurkeBigsby> what was the first person RE game on PS2 where you're on a boat? Was that one shit?
[2:13:53] <+swaggopotamus> Everything looks falt on here.
[2:13:55] <%trekkie11041> BREIFCASE PAT
[2:13:56] <oniwahoo> CVX Remake: It's the same game, but the graphics are better and you have to run it 3 times!
[2:13:57] <+TaphexWin> Can you lockpick duraluminum cases?
[2:14:00] <MSN04_Sazabi> CV is more like DMC2 LUL
[2:14:00] <%FirearmsInstructor> @TheSphereHunter Henlo Suzi notkohWave
[2:14:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Desertfishing no that is Jill
[2:14:03] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> If they remake this game they should leave Steve exactly as he is right now, dont change a single thing
[2:14:03] <%Pigg1yJuffs> All of you are talking about RE 6 and CV as the worst games, but I haven't seen a single mention of that fucking online Umbrella Corp game?
[2:14:03] <%todcomod> But DMC4 isn't bad
[2:14:06] <$joylent_blue> DMC4 has good gameplay and some awesome cutscenes tho
[2:14:06] <KatabolicRage> You have almost 200 rounds
[2:14:08] <%pan_nochal> 182 bullets what the fuck
[2:14:09] <tiaramaki> Briefcase, too
[2:14:11] <+el_thag> Dead Aim whoever asked
[2:14:14] <%passthehanky> pat you have nearly 200 handgun bullets what the FUCK
[2:14:15] <%Desertfishing> @doc_ock_rokc oh ya lol
[2:14:15] <A_Family_Man> 6 has so much more okay shit to make you forget how bad it is till you play it. This has like 1 ham of an Ashford and Neo Wesker and that's it.
[2:14:17] <%todcomod> It's just ok
[2:14:20] <$MildConviction> but DMC4 can be actually be fun though
[2:14:20] <%cowardman93> DMC4 is dope y'all can fuck off
[2:14:21] <%GalacticaPhanto> I mean is it bad that I actually enjoyed Operation Raccoon City? mainly because I had a group of people who I played with the entire time
[2:14:21] <%connos_procrastination> BOOTI play CEE VEE EX
[2:14:23] <%SwagglesMD> Survivor 2
[2:14:25] <%Aydarkzero> just use the knife 4Head
[2:14:26] <%SwagglesMD> Who asked?
[2:14:26] <+TaphexWin> Yeah, cuz that's knife is fucking broken as shit
[2:14:27] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Pigg1yJuffs Because its not real, its a myth
[2:14:30] <rcand9> i forgot about the set piece shit
[2:14:30] <ProfessorLitmus> play ORC
[2:14:31] <%Validuntil2077> Umbrella corps canonically resurrected Wesker again
[2:14:32] <%tigerfang86> oh, worm?
[2:14:34] <natebud> How about this, first hour of RE6 or CVX?
[2:14:35] <%tigerfang86> oh w o r m?
[2:14:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> Shoot the zombie
[2:14:39] <xanderfist> survivor is the worst
[2:14:43] <Ipsenscastle> DMC4 is only bad by DMC standards, it's still rad
[2:14:44] <Kejang> chat wyldyn out
[2:14:45] <Reaganball_Z> Boondersnootch
[2:14:45] <+Jp3g95> PogChamp
[2:14:46] <%D3rrtyD4n> atpCap
[2:14:50] <RunningNGunning> CRAZY TALK
[2:14:50] <%SwagglesMD> Oh yea, excellent suggestion
[2:14:50] <%Aydarkzero> what a great encounter!
[2:14:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> OH no
[2:14:51] <+amiroodude> Big scare
[2:14:52] <%todcomod> First hour of RE6, Leon's campaign
[2:14:56] <+TungstenViper> @pan_nochal most think DMC4 sucks because you replay the same levels as Dante
[2:14:57] <+AXL808> critical emotional hit by Pat to worm
[2:15:00] <%dukenux> Oh no, it's Lovecrafts
[2:15:01] <%passthehanky> this or ORC?
[2:15:01] <%takiyami> apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong
[2:15:04] <djazo> remember the ada story in RE6 it was the worst LUL
[2:15:05] <+dheng1> Big spooky
[2:15:08] <%SwagglesMD> Hey Pat, play Gun Survivor 2 on stream apatDab Kappa
[2:15:08] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> DMC4 is fine mechanically
[2:15:09] <+kringler> DMC4 was awesome
[2:15:10] <natebud> @todcomod that is the correct answer
[2:15:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> apatCrazy apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhand
[2:15:12] <danknugglit> Spooky game
[2:15:13] <%JayZenoa> JayZenoa subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months! yfw cuphead tho
[2:15:14] <oyyzzo> let chris deal with it
[2:15:14] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> And it's fun
[2:15:15] <Mantorok06> Good thing zombies never learned how to open doors or follow you through rooms
[2:15:17] <%pan_nochal> @TungstenViper yeah but the plot is good, the new characters are good, the gameplay is amazing, the designs are amazing, etc.
[2:15:17] <%passthehanky> RE6 or umbrella corps?
[2:15:17] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Zombies are just misunderstood, they're just territorial and endlessly hungry
[2:15:21] <%dukenux> Is Dead Aim or Survivor the shitty on-rails shooter?
[2:15:22] <$joylent_blue> most high level players swear by DMC4 and say its the best in the series even still
[2:15:23] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> So when does chris or wesker show up?
[2:15:23] <%pan_nochal> CVX is a joke compared to DMC4
[2:15:27] <%FirearmsInstructor> IT'S FUCKING JANUARY
[2:15:29] <+officialprisonmike> what happened to re3?
[2:15:29] <%FirearmsInstructor> I JUST REALIZED
[2:15:31] <+kringler> Dead Aim was also a good game
[2:15:32] <MSN04_Sazabi> "DMC4 is bad" wow, look at those takes crawling out of the woodwork LUL
[2:15:33] <%TheSphereHunter> I have mad nostalgia for this game but compared to the three awesome games that came before CV is very boring and dull
[2:15:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> Cup head being a gunner was nice
[2:15:35] <+TaphexWin> Dang, they really re-used the RE2 male zombie groans
[2:15:36] <%Validuntil2077> Dmc4 is great
[2:15:38] <Fien111> DMC4 is great, Nero's the shit and Dante has fun weapons to play with
[2:15:39] <Virgil_Valentine> Gameplay wise DMC 4 is sweet. Story falls flat end game tho
[2:15:42] <+kringler> Imagine comparing two totally different games. Lmfao
[2:15:42] <%Capta1n_H3nry> DMC 4 for Switch when
[2:15:42] <fusedforms> real zombie chorus in here
[2:15:43] <%Aydarkzero> Leon's Campaign yeah i'm always down, Sherry & Jake alright this is literally always jumping the shark, Chris and Piers? eh alright shooty gun game
[2:15:43] <+el_thag> Survivor 2 is the on rails
[2:15:44] <%todcomod> DMC4 is the weakest of the good DMC games
[2:15:45] <%Garthunox> @passthehanky how bout you dont bring up UC
[2:15:47] <%GalacticaPhanto> apatBlep_TK
[2:15:49] <rcand9> controversial opinion leons scenario is actually not great in 6
[2:15:50] <+goatofdeparture666> member when ustanak tried to be the new nemesis?
[2:15:50] <%necrocannibal2> DMC4 sucks when you're playing Dante
[2:15:53] <Ipsenscastle> CVX is more of a DMC2, just boring
[2:15:54] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> You guys are on fucking crack what the fuck are you talking about
[2:15:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @MSN04_Sazabi DMC4 isn't bad but it does repeat itself which makes it weak
[2:15:59] <natebud> Oh, yeah you can't freely walk up stairs in this game either.
[2:16:01] <tripessolides> leon's scenario is really not great
[2:16:01] <GUNxSPECTRE> Guys, remember HELENA
[2:16:02] <%Capta1n_H3nry> DMC 4 is the Vento Aureo of DMC games
[2:16:08] <%Mekhet09> What Dante is great what the fuck are you talking about.
[2:16:09] <%passthehanky> @TheSphereHunter your video on CVX was the best part of CVX tbh
[2:16:18] <%pan_nochal> DMC1 is the Dino Crisis or Resident Evil
[2:16:18] <+TaphexWin> I feel up until you get to Hong Kong, Leon's campaign is fine
[2:16:19] <%pan_nochal> think about it
[2:16:21] <%Garthunox> @gunxspectre and her sister
[2:16:21] <%vergiIsparda> @joylent_blue it is the best, I've never had so much fun playing a game as I did dmc4 ( except the reboot, but I just don't hop on the 2/reboot are bad bandwagon lol )
[2:16:21] <%pan_nochal> Kappa
[2:16:23] <%Jane_Lo> You all are giving me a headache, your takes are thr worst bawkKek
[2:16:23] <%todcomod> Nothing about RE6 is that great
[2:16:24] <%Mekhet09> Nero's so fucking lame in his moveset.
[2:16:25] <%necrocannibal2> Dante fucking sucks dick in DMC4, dude. he's a square peg in a round hole.
[2:16:32] <%todcomod> Except the cool movement system
[2:16:37] <%Mekhet09> You are fucking insane.
[2:16:37] <%necrocannibal2> the enemies are clearly designed with Nero in mind
[2:16:39] <GUNxSPECTRE> It's like 420 in there
[2:16:40] <%Aydarkzero> i find it weird that CVX was my introduction to RE yet i never played it
[2:16:41] <%cowardman93> DMC4SE may be the best DMC game fight me
[2:16:41] <DuoScratch> okay, did someone smear mud on the lense!?
[2:16:42] <%AkronymCLT> remember when Helena got that whole city killed?
[2:16:44] <rcand9> its just the lighting
[2:16:44] <natebud> Which mansion is worse, CVX or RE0?
[2:16:46] <+TungstenViper> @tripessolides CV is not boring at all. it only is if you don't pay attention to what's happening.
[2:16:50] <%Mekhet09> And Nero's playset is lame.
[2:16:50] <grayjammer> BROWN
[2:16:51] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> People really be out here saying DMC4 is bad fucking lmao
[2:16:53] <Ipsenscastle> It's like playing the game through a pair of tights
[2:16:53] <%connos_procrastination> @necrocannibal2 Uncle dante is great your nuts
[2:16:54] <%passthehanky> like is the game supposed to look so drab?
[2:16:55] <rcand9> lighting is garbage
[2:16:55] <+AXL808> i've seen office buildings more colorful

[2:16:57] <KatabolicRage> this is what, an early go at proper 3d enciroments in resi evil? is any of this pre-rendered?
[2:17:00] <bear_breaker20> @todcomod and leon being in anything*
[2:17:01] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> RE6 had some good things.... well Len's campaign
[2:17:02] <%SuperFineButtHairs> DMC 4 is the Diamond is Unbreakable of DMC you idiots
[2:17:02] <KatabolicRage> enviroments rather
[2:17:03] <A_Family_Man> Controls in RE6 is like proto Phantom Pain
[2:17:03] <%Sartastic> Helena's hot gooey sister
[2:17:04] <%pan_nochal> RE0 mansion makes no sense, so I guess CVX
[2:17:06] <%Validuntil2077> nah Nero is great
[2:17:08] <%dukenux> Brown/grey palette, and dimmed lightning. CVX was ahead of it's time Kappa
[2:17:10] <AutechreTwinAphex> I think it looked a tiny bit better on Dreamcast but not by much
[2:17:10] <%todcomod> DMC3 = DMC5 > DMC1 > DMC4>>>>DMC2
[2:17:12] <%天使42199> dante looked hella weird with the beefed up body and anime dude haircut in dmc 4. glad they turned him normal in dmc 5

[2:17:16] <$Afterman_> claire the master of unlocking
[2:17:20] <Ipsenscastle> Who spilled coffee all over Code Veronica
[2:17:21] <djazo> @thespherehunter i have nostalgia for this game to that.s why i don.t want to play to not hate
[2:17:22] <%necrocannibal2> DANTE SUCKS IN DMC4 THAT'S A FACT
[2:17:24] <%bluebiscuit94> Man you can tell how boring CVX is by the fact that people are arguing about DMC instead
[2:17:25] <%SwagglesMD> CVX is my fav RE but boi does it has tons of problems
[2:17:27] <scottishwolf> twitch continues to be weird for me today
[2:17:28] <Fujiwara_92> Now the bow gun get good
[2:17:28] <djazo> it
[2:17:29] <%Storm_Samurai> @AngriestPat Hey pat thanks for showing off HD version of RE2 and RE3 grabbed them recently and they look amazing!
[2:17:30] <%Mekhet09> Supper bad takes.
[2:17:30] <%necrocannibal2> THEY DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO MAKE LEVELS FOR HIM
[2:17:31] <%SwagglesMD> More so than any other RE at times
[2:17:31] <$Afterman_> the best part of dmc4 is the lucifer weapon
[2:17:32] <Stygian_Wolf> just ignore all the bad shit 4head and maybe this will be an okay game
[2:17:33] <+TungstenViper> guys... really? now DMC4 is suddenly an amazing game? cmon now...
[2:17:35] <%necrocannibal2> SO THEY JUST PUT HIM IN NERO'S LEVELS
[2:17:35] <ha2ken> Bowgun powder sounds dumb
[2:17:35] <%Aydarkzero> should i play Devl May Cry Kappa
[2:17:37] <Phantonbat> Best Save Room theme
[2:17:37] <+Jam_Jam> Are you not playing League of Legends anymore? @AngriestPat
[2:17:42] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> ANIME HAIRCUT? He has the same hair in like every game
[2:17:43] <$joylent_blue> necrocannibal2 just because he's difficult to play doesn't mean he's bad, he's OP as fuck if you're good with him
[2:17:44] <%Pigg1yJuffs> For everyone arguing DMC games. Here is a non-controversial lineup of good to bad games. 1. DMC3 2. DMC 5 3. DMC 4 4. DMC 5. DmC 6. DMC 2
[2:17:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> @necrocannibal2 Dante has solutions to some of the monsters. Nero felt very...linear in some ways. Just hit enemy till your Devil bringer can grab them
[2:17:45] <%GalacticaPhanto> Although this save room music slaps tho
[2:17:47] <%cowardman93> DMC4 was amazing at the time
[2:17:47] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> only thing I didn't like about RE0 was the lack of an item box.
[2:17:50] <%Mekhet09> And it's still more fun then playing nero.
[2:17:52] <%bigdumbidiotguy> shit ass fuck dick
[2:17:53] <%Jane_Lo> this chat apatWhat
[2:17:55] <%passthehanky> @AngriestPat did you ever get into teamfight tactics?
[2:17:56] <KatabolicRage> dmc4 was only bad for making you do the levels twice
[2:17:57] <prophetdisharmonious> Is this the power of an enemy stand!?
[2:17:57] <sugarveins> Video games...
[2:17:58] <%cowardman93> it just got better with the PC port
[2:17:59] <%vaporousTippler> Fuck. I forgot Pat played LoL.
[2:18:00] <%pan_nochal> you were supposed to be the ones to fill my dark soul with light, chat
[2:18:00] <Eye_of_Hades> i only ever used the regular bow gun on bandersnatches
[2:18:02] <%connos_procrastination> DMC4 is fine the worst part is the half a game twice shit
[2:18:02] <fusedforms> BOGAN POWDER
[2:18:02] <artoflec> I could never really figure out how to use Lucifer, DMC4 is so great though elaCozy

[2:18:30] <CandyCoatedConfection> Do people think of this game fondly? I didn't grow up playing video games but this is always revered. This is my second time seeing this game and it kinda really sucks.
[2:18:31] <%necrocannibal2> Dante is not difficult, he's just bad
[2:18:32] <%silverira> this chat has gone mad

[2:18:59] <TheGershon> It was TWO dreamcast disks!
[2:19:01] <MSN04_Sazabi> Tidus is the superior character BY FAR
[2:19:02] <sugarveins> :(
[2:19:04] <+dheng1> At least tidus kinda matures
[2:19:04] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> How is Dante bad? He's even more broken than nero in 4 and Nero is broken in 4 too
[2:19:09] <%Sartastic> I like CVX but I also like tank controls
[2:19:09] <%necrocannibal2> why do you think all the weapons he gets make no sense? they were supposed to be his bosses

[2:24:16] <%Aydarkzero> for some reason i always thought they'd be tougher to take down
[2:24:16] <%peachy996> The comical thump of getting punched by those LUL
[2:24:27] <+TungstenViper> @l_a_s_e_r_m_a_n yes

[2:34:46] <+CuddlyKaiju> why are there enemies that can hit you off screen?
[2:34:47] <%Razputin217> STUN LOCK CITY, BITCH
[2:34:47] <%dukenux> same animation every time
[2:34:47] <+el_thag> Human Unit Never Killed
[2:34:48] <%peachy996> Get punched
[2:34:52] <+CuddlyKaiju> who thought that was a good idea?
[2:34:53] <%Tracazoid> At least they weren't Eliminators
[2:34:54] <%rufus2k2> WHY DID IT TAKE YOU SO LONG TO SWAP WEAPONS
[2:34:56] <%asgard147> HUNK has a point there. No one told him he was transporting a TYRANT
[2:35:03] <%MayorRev> there was a multiplayer resident evil that was like Rainbow 6 or whatever, was that just a fever dream for me?
[2:35:06] <%spiritofmojave> Like how this tyrant basically has that stretchy hand you could get from gift shops
[2:35:06] <%Jekado> should of used your V skill
[2:35:06] <jorniev> those enemies seem like dog shit
[2:35:11] <oyyzzo> most of the game's budget went to pachinko
[2:35:15] <%Aydarkzero> so Hunk showed up here for a delivery?
[2:35:17] <%peachy996> @MayorRev do you mean ORC?
[2:35:21] <%suikudo> @MayorRev Operation racoon city?
[2:35:25] <%Jekado> zombie footies
[2:35:27] <$joylent_blue> the Hunk Teppen is super good too, he gets buffed as more of his teammates die
[2:35:28] <+el_thag> Honestly couldn’t a Tyrant transport itself?
[2:35:29] <%MayorRev> oh that
[2:35:31] <+gambit_gamble> they suck sweet ass
[2:35:33] <enby_shout> Pat four asses or seven asses
[2:35:33] <%MayorRev> NotLikeThis
[2:35:34] <%Sovspot> Sovspot subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 9 month streak! Hey you and woolie have mention several times about people might dislike you guys talk about cannibalism, barf and other bullshit. Honestly though, I am way more engaged with those discussions than fighting games. No offense.
[2:35:36] <%peachy996> Never forget ORC
[2:35:39] <%MayorRev> I totally forgot
[2:35:44] <$joylent_blue> Teppen card*
[2:35:45] <+TaphexWin> Oh absolutely
[2:35:45] <%peachy996> and the team of memorable Not-HUNKS
[2:35:45] <%suikudo> You must remember
[2:35:49] <%Aydarkzero> @el_thag it would probably kill a few things on the way over first
[2:35:51] <Ipsenscastle> @TheSphereHunter Ever thought of doing a retrospective of the Gun Survivor series? There was even that Dino Crisis one!
[2:35:52] <absdaddy> for sure
[2:35:52] <%jillvxlentine> i think the moths are more annoying because poision
[2:35:59] <%Psych_man13_13> I will never stop trying to push ORC
[2:36:00] <natebud> Plus the unskippable door animations
[2:36:02] <%peachy996> Quick name all the Not Hunks in ORC
[2:36:02] <%suikudo> Remember ORC forever and always
[2:36:03] <%cowardman93> the Delta force stuff for ORC was not that bad
[2:36:04] <%FalseEyeD> Suzi just straight up threw in towel playing this two night ago
[2:36:05] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> Code Veronica isnt the best RE tbh, I still love it tho
[2:36:08] <%jillvxlentine> poison8
[2:36:08] <%Gogetta159> Yeah thats why I grw to dislike it when I replayed it recently
[2:36:09] <oyyzzo> truly this is a resident evilvania
[2:36:11] <%cowardman93> like as a dumb shooter
[2:36:12] <+TaphexWin> What's the most annoying RE monster?
[2:36:15] <jorniev> should they remake this game?
[2:36:21] <majima666> eliminators
[2:36:22] <+FuzzyWuzzy337> is it intentional that when your health is critical that you start doing zombie hobbling
[2:36:26] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> how good is going through a door in the remakes
[2:36:26] <natebud> CVX moths
[2:36:29] <+FuzzyWuzzy337> because it feels like it is
[2:36:30] <+OhioNitsud> apatElmo
[2:36:33] <+saadi90> RE0 monkeys
[2:36:34] <burstaxe> the most annoying enemies are all in this game

[2:36:36] <%SolidusRex> Bandervaginas
[2:36:39] <%天使42199> @taphexwin the bandersnatch is annoying

[2:37:00] <CassyASG> @天使42199 15 hrs!!?? i don't remeber RE 4 being that long but i believe you

[2:37:16] <rytisone> toss them a banana

[2:37:19] <%SuperFineButtHairs> its on the ps4
[2:37:20] <jorniev> i dont quite remember this game, this is the dreamcast one right?

[2:37:31] <+el_thag> People it’s available on PS4
[2:37:34] <%spongeofmystery> You ever hear about the giant mind controlling spider enemies that were removed for being too fucking weird and disturbing?
[2:37:36] <+TaphexWin> The respawning moths in the Antarctic base are bad because they choke off a FUCKING SAVE POINT. Eliminators are awful as well though
[2:37:37] <%rufus2k2> WTF at that range

[2:39:05] <AutechreTwinAphex> he's probably lying about the Chapter 7 bankruptcy too to get more pity coins out of people
[2:39:07] <%Valdorick> See, guys, this is why Pat will NEVER get into Fate. Because then he'd be 500 dollars deep in FATE Gacha before going "This shit is dumb" and never playing it again.
[2:39:08] <Ipsenscastle> are people actually giving that fucker money?
[2:39:08] <+PalmtopNami> thats both mine and my parents yearly income combined
[2:39:09] <%Aydarkzero> @MayorRev WOW DUDE OKAY
[2:39:09] <+PanicSwytch> BASICALLY ITS FREE MONEY
[2:39:13] <+el_thag> Of all the things why WWE?
[2:39:16] <%Aydarkzero> lmao
[2:39:20] <%dukenux> @Jekado absolutely. A prime whale
[2:39:20] <+TaphexWin> Then lest we forget the HotS fiasco
[2:39:20] <Ner234> I don't even know what 50k looks like in my own currency ... wtf DSP
[2:39:21] <%Validuntil2077> pat spent 1000 dollars on overwatch!?
[2:39:21] <rytisone> use a guillotine
[2:39:21] <+PalmtopNami> And my girlfriends
[2:39:22] <natebud> To help distract you from the excessive backtracking
[2:39:22] <%Dakuu75> I wonder if Pat could say his loot-boxes are Tax-deductable because theyr'e for his job @AngriestPat
[2:39:23] <$MildConviction> how does DSP feed himself NotLikeThis
[2:39:23] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> gasp
[2:39:26] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> spending irl money in games calebHa
[2:39:27] <%Desertfishing> oh no zombies
[2:39:27] <%Aydarkzero> @el_thag he was a big fan of it
[2:39:29] <oniwahoo> But the knife has unlimited ammo!
[2:39:30] <%necrocannibal2> ZOMBIES?!
[2:39:32] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> not da guillotine!
[2:39:32] <%dukenux> DO YOU HEAR THE PEOPLE SING
[2:39:33] <%asgard147> limesD
[2:39:33] <Willfordbrimly> Pat won't get into Fate because Fate is trash
[2:39:34] <+Dingalow> You wouldn't have as much ammo if the knife wasn't so powerful
[2:39:39] <BeefMcCat> This was a game I was very proud of myself for completing at the time
[2:39:41] <%NekoUrabe> I love that the zombies just flop over instead of falling like they usually do
[2:39:43] <+TungstenViper> @pat_squared good job Pat! you helped the predatory schemes. Bad Pat. BAD
[2:39:45] <jorniev> OOOH NOOO
[2:39:45] <%rufus2k2> 2 FUCKING ZOMBIES?!
[2:39:46] <%Aydarkzero> just use the knife 4Head
[2:39:46] <%asgard147> limesGiggle
[2:39:47] <AutechreTwinAphex> this was probably during the youtube honeymoon period and he probably never once reported taxes on all that money
[2:39:47] <+ZephynM> This game looks exciting!
[2:39:50] <%rufus2k2> At least put a licker in there
[2:39:58] <AutechreTwinAphex> dude basically knows nothing about business
[2:39:59] <natebud> Imagine the backtracking without respawning zombies
[2:40:03] <%jcflyguy> Is this where the series started to go less survival horror and more action?
[2:40:03] <%FirearmsInstructor> @tripessolides what even is that? What's a GACHAS games?
[2:40:12] <%SuperFineButtHairs> GOT YA
[2:40:13] <%derrickslays> AYD FUCKO
[2:40:14] <jorniev> that reminded me of escape from bug island
[2:40:15] <TheGershon> A gurb
[2:40:15] <%Aydarkzero> @AutechreTwinAphex but he has a business degree Kappa
[2:40:16] <tiaramaki> Gerbs, Rerbs, and Blerbs
[2:40:19] <Fujiwara_92> grerb
[2:40:23] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Is this even a good game? like out of ten
[2:40:24] <%SuperFineButtHairs> gorbs?
[2:40:24] <+ZephynM> A Licker? Heck, I hardly know'er!
[2:40:30] <+senordingdong2> lol
[2:40:35] <AutechreTwinAphex> @Aydarkzero probably gets handed out like candy in his neck of the woods
[2:40:35] <%Darren716> Even better tha business, DSP has a finance degree
[2:40:36] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> @raaaaainmaker 7
[2:40:37] <%necrocannibal2> DSP graduated from one of Canada's top business schools with really good grades.
[2:40:38] <%Aydarkzero> i'd give this game like a 7
[2:40:38] <$joylent_blue> FirearmsInstructor a game that's basically like "you have this random chance to get the characters you want! spend money for more tries :) "
[2:40:42] <+TungstenViper> @jcflyguy not really. maybe in cutscenes...
[2:40:43] <+sausagepantsarecool> Code Veronica is a solid 5.5
[2:40:44] <djazo> @firearmsinstructor you don.t need to know stay pure LUL
[2:40:49] <%Mekhet09> Gachapon or gacha games are ones in which you have to spend money to get units at random chance.
[2:40:50] <%FirearmsInstructor> @tripessolides Is that like a lootbox?
[2:40:57] <%Darren716> Dispite this his mom had to help him figure out his mortgage
[2:40:58] <%SoFarFetched> @FirearmsInstructor pretty much
[2:41:00] <%FirearmsInstructor> @joylent_blue lootbox thing?
[2:41:02] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> 7 is pretty good
[2:41:02] <natebud> @sausagepantsarecool for now
[2:41:05] <tripessolides> yeah pretty much

[2:41:38] <%cowardman93> chonky boi
[2:41:39] <+sausagepantsarecool> Yeah even compared to A B scenario in RE2 its way long
[2:41:40] <%天使42199> @darren716 I mean shit there's people working shitty jobs to get through med school and whatnot. sometimes you need help from others
[2:41:40] <%Desertfishing> speed run
[2:41:40] <+TaphexWin> Those BOW rounds are nuts
[2:41:41] <%senordingdong2> senordingdong2 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak! I am so excited to watch you play my childhood games bud

[2:41:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DO 12 HOUR STREAMS COWARS
[2:41:57] <CassyASG> this game is one of the longest of Resi games
[2:41:59] <tiaramaki> Aren't the BOW Rounds good for only one enemy or something?
[2:42:00] <d00med_magus> so between this and the downcoming which is worse
[2:42:01] <%Aydarkzero> speed running games makes you got a little crazy
[2:42:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[2:42:02] <oniwahoo> 4 is a lot, I feel like that's an overestimation of the game
[2:42:02] <TastySammiches> shitty games done slow

[2:42:06] <Fluxraw> No Hit Run LUL

[2:42:09] <+Grandnatics> Fight through the pain
[2:42:10] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> so you'll actually do an 8 hour stream for once calebHa
[2:42:11] <%jillvxlentine> pat needs his naps
[2:42:13] <%Dakuu75> Has Pat ever tried to speed-run anything?
[2:42:13] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Let the man sleep.

[2:42:19] <+machshop> you would be wrong
[2:42:20] <AutechreTwinAphex> honestly it's no wonder the financial hole Phil is in - nobody wants to go and watch a mid 30 something guy play boomer games like Myst or Toonstruck - WTF
[2:42:22] <+TaphexWin> He must recharge the orb
[2:42:23] <+el_thag> Chris coming the protect the bloodline
[2:42:23] <+Dingalow> You once tried a 24 hour stream tho

[2:42:26] <%Sartastic> all pat all day
[2:42:27] <+ZephynM> I just like having some Pat.
[2:42:28] <natebud> I like my Pats on the edge of burnout, not actually burnt out
[2:42:29] <absdaddy> @legendarydorkknight calebD
[2:42:29] <%valriot> Yeah cos we already get that Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:42:30] <%cowardman93> you're consistent at destroying the schedule
[2:42:32] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> Fucking Max played through the entirety of Dirge of Cerberus yesterday
[2:42:32] <+TungstenViper> ConsisPAT
[2:42:34] <Fujiwara_92> nah, burnout pat is fun sometimes too
[2:42:34] <rcand9> we want grander pat
[2:42:35] <%Nina96> remember paige?
[2:42:37] <+Grandnatics> It's consistent if you're always on
[2:42:38] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Consistent like you are with your playing FFVII on schedule? LUL
[2:42:39] <MrCyan> would you ever stream with Jerma985?
[2:42:40] <%Thalchampz> i just rather you not be dead mid stream

[2:42:42] <+machshop> i want Punished Pat
[2:42:43] <%TheQButton> I'd take either honestly.
[2:42:44] <%mrcelab> @AngriestPat We love any Pat of You

[2:42:46] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> took him like nine and a half hours
[2:42:47] <%Valdorick> 24 hour streams suck anyway. More so solo
[2:42:47] <%Rngiddion> oh right rip stormsblood lol
[2:42:48] <%Skittlesoul> consistently more pat
[2:42:49] <%dirtygaijin> ah the game broke before you however
[2:42:51] <%necrocannibal2> why doesn't Paige stream anymore?
[2:42:51] <rcand9> largest pat
[2:42:52] <%Desertfishing> we would be constPATed
[2:42:55] <d00med_magus> do a 24 hour stream you coward
[2:42:57] <%necrocannibal2> talking about consistency
[2:42:57] <oniwahoo> I prefer current Pat to broken Pat, I don't have a warranty
[2:42:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I dont know that Tired Pat is great LUL
[2:42:58] <%SuperFineButtHairs> murder is cool
[2:42:58] <djazo> chris is 90 percent of the time the worst part of his game LUL
[2:42:58] <%vectorless_peon> Consistancy> Quantitiy over short periods
[2:42:59] <+ZephynM> Mmm, gotta have me some Pat. You know? Get some Pat time.
[2:42:59] <+el_thag> Consistent in his inconsistency
[2:42:59] <%takiyami> I was there
[2:43:01] <%maskofmichael> Instead of 1 12 hour stream, do 12 1 hour streams
[2:43:01] <%rufus2k2> Jerma? the man who doesn't know what an omega symbol is?
[2:43:03] <%Jeemukun> I'd rather a pat that takes care of himself so we can enjoy his content for longer
[2:43:05] <+TaphexWin> That Dirge of Cerberus stream was fucking brutal
[2:43:07] <%spiritofmojave> @fruit_pie_the_magician And had to have his heart crushed with rest of us today after the Smash direct, poor guy
[2:43:13] <+Dingalow> 24 hr streams sound more fun to do than to actually watch
[2:43:15] <+sausagepantsarecool> omg this is really scary
[2:43:15] <%bluebiscuit94> Demon in my mind apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace
[2:43:15] <$joylent_blue> FirearmsInstructor i don't think so, if you want to lore-dive on DSP there's a youtube video called "Down the Rabbit Hole - DarkSydePhil" its interesting in a.... weird way
[2:43:16] <burstaxe> In Gun Survivor, there was a guy who really really wanted to fuck a spider
[2:43:17] <%FirearmsInstructor> How far through the game is pat right now?
[2:43:18] <%FalseEyeD> @AngriestPat Hydrate
[2:43:18] <%Pigg1yJuffs> So everyone is agreeing that they want Pat edging on burnout, rather than full blown burnout?
[2:43:18] <+professormorrigan> monkaS
[2:43:19] <AutechreTwinAphex> @TaphexWin what that stream told me is that PCSX2 still sucks donkey balls

[2:44:01] <%FirearmsInstructor> @joylent_blue no thanks I refuse to even consider acknowledging that rabbit hole. I'm content with either a one or two line TL;DR, or not knowing. Either way I don't care enough :P But thank you :)
[2:44:02] <%jillvxlentine> nearly 2 hours through the game i think
[2:44:09] <Ipsenscastle> Hey remember when Pat played DMCV? That was a good time
[2:44:11] <DraxTD> How can this BE?!?
[2:44:12] <oyyzzo> this made at least one person cry and shit their pants

[2:48:49] <+Grandnatics> WHY DID HE HAVE A PIANO ROLL
[2:48:54] <tiaramaki> How did that piano roll get inside that iron maiden? Don't worry about it
[2:48:55] <%dukenux> shouldn't it be Pianola Roll
[2:48:55] <TonberryLives> What a fantastic and interesting puzzle
[2:48:57] <nademonkey1100> not as good as oven man though
[2:48:59] <Flame_Hyenard> kiitWave
[2:49:03] <%cowardman93> it has no urgency
[2:49:10] <%spiritofmojave> fart gas defeated
[2:49:12] <%bigdumbidiotguy> I own this game but I think I've only played like 45mins in
[2:49:13] <%Aydarkzero> like you just sort of shoot your way through and call it a day
[2:49:17] <%Nina96> and the dialog
[2:49:18] <+TaphexWin> I think the art style doesn't fit horror
[2:49:19] <%dukenux> It tries badly to add it with "heartbeat" effects, but it doesn't work
[2:49:20] <$joylent_blue> oven man would definitely beat up iron maiden guy
[2:49:21] <Reaganball_Z> Look at that fapping chair
[2:49:23] <oyyzzo> this game makes my neck muscles tense while i yawn
[2:49:23] <+Grandnatics> Maybe it was just a regular metal roll before getting into an iron maiden
[2:49:24] <+CuddlyKaiju> it somehow looks stiffer than the original re2
[2:49:25] <%bigdumbidiotguy> beaten all the others though
[2:49:26] <+DiabloDeAzul> tbh, if the island is this fucked, how could it get any worse?
[2:49:27] <Ipsenscastle> The areas are too spacious
[2:49:29] <%lethallunacyx> its icky
[2:49:30] <%Validuntil2077> its a really good thing alfred is in this game

[2:49:40] <%SuperFineButtHairs> DSP is still bitching, hes been going for an hour
[2:49:41] <natebud> Now run past the bridge on fire, run back because the jeep is in the way, climb up on the box, climb off of the box, climb the staircase, climb the other staircase.
[2:49:42] <biomegabear> which is why it needs a remake
[2:49:46] <rytisone> needs some sort of foe or nemesis Kappa
[2:49:48] <%passthehanky> compared to how great the ps1 games still look, this game looks like trash
[2:49:50] <Mcgack2> with a mod
[2:49:50] <%takiyami> It looks like a generic adventure game
[2:49:51] <%天使42199> I like how Clair looks in this
[2:49:52] <%rufus2k2> I think Claire is at her cutest here
[2:49:52] <studleydoorite> nah oven man would put up a good fight in the first 3 seconds, but he burns out quick Kappa
[2:49:57] <%Jekado> isn't bitch DSP... thing?
[2:49:58] <+TenguGemini> is this still one of the best knives in the series?
[2:50:02] <%Validuntil2077> its 3d character models are really impressive for the time
[2:50:02] <majima666> if they used pre-rendered backgrounds it would have looked as good as REmake most likely
[2:50:03] <%dirtygaijin> Im interested to see what they do to improve this one if they ever get to remaking it
[2:50:03] <KatabolicRage> the dreamcast had this era of trying to do realism, there was this, shenmue, that berserk game... they all have this same slightly washed out style that aged bad
[2:50:07] <Flame_Hyenard> Steve is the worst in this game
[2:50:10] <+TenguGemini> I recall using the knife a ton in this game
[2:50:12] <+TaphexWin> I would like to see them remake a BAD resident evil, just to see if they could fix it
[2:50:17] <%Jekado> isn't he also always loosing money or something?
[2:50:20] <majima666> but i understand them wanting to further it and try ful 3d
[2:50:21] <%templar010> templar010 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 4 month streak! So how about that Direct? Honestly just make the next smash character a sword with a blue cape at this point
[2:50:24] <%FirearmsInstructor> Plz stop with DSP updates. I'm third generation don't give a fuck. Thx. <3
[2:50:25] <$joylent_blue> TenguGemini yeah pat was using just the knife for a while
[2:50:25] <MattDemers> Does anyone have a better control scheme for V in DMCV? Griffon on X kinda sucks
[2:50:27] <+el_thag> It’s early 3D man gotta forgive it a bit
[2:50:37] <%passthehanky> if they did remake this game i totally think they could make it really good
[2:50:42] <%OldOnyx> meh, cvx in general looks worse than the original in a lot of ways but it wasn't great to begin with
[2:50:45] <%Psych_man13_13> If they remade any of the spin offs, which would you want it to be?
[2:50:49] <MattDemers> Thanks Pat, was hoping not to bug you ;)
[2:50:50] <GrayFox182> This is one of the only RE games that I’ve never finished
[2:50:52] <djazo> the best looking Clair is the first RE CGI MOVIE
[2:50:56] <%Validuntil2077> Griffon is blue rose for V
[2:50:56] <%天使42199> damn people still trying to bring the topic back to the direct?
[2:51:02] <%Aydarkzero> i don't mind RE games getting a remaster i just really want RE8 to come out i loved re7
[2:51:06] <%Darren716> Yeah i bought DMC V last night, was excited for today...
[2:51:08] <%passthehanky> yall re2 remake claire is such a cute tho
[2:51:08] <%takiyami> Griffon on L1, Shadow on L2. Works good with my Nero muscle memory.
[2:51:11] <+TenguGemini> there are RE CGI movies?
[2:51:13] <%spiritofmojave> Griffon on square makes the most sense to me
[2:51:21] <%jillvxlentine> yeah 3 of them
[2:51:23] <%connos_procrastination> ay lmao
[2:51:24] <%天使42199> LUL
[2:51:25] <$joylent_blue> MattDemers yeah putting Griffon on R2 helps a ton
[2:51:25] <%AkronymCLT> default r2 is read book
[2:51:26] <%cowardman93> RE1 had the mystery to it of what the hell was going on, RE2 was about finding the cops then quickly moved on to getting away from MR X and Birkin, RE3 is getting the hell out of Raccoon with Nemesis chasing you but this just has... nothing, you're on an island for some reason and zombies are knocking about
[2:51:26] <%Aydarkzero> @TenguGemini yes and they are silly
[2:51:27] <+el_thag> Surely RE8 is next haven’t they been making that?
[2:51:27] <%Mekhet09> That direct sucks and I think it made me hate fire emblem.
[2:51:28] <biomegabear> Im sure CVX will get good at some point

[2:55:00] <%TheSphereHunter> HOW DARE YOU
[2:55:00] <+CuddlyKaiju> Wesker is a 13 year old edgelord in a grown mans body
[2:55:00] <%cowardman93> it never made sense how he went from RE1 crooked cop to super human
[2:55:03] <%Tracazoid> So who's the better Wesker Pat, Albert or Alex?
[2:55:03] <%OldOnyx> I'm more dissappointed they didn't hold on to lucas longer
[2:55:08] <Cactuskris> I love the Matrix

[2:55:13] <young_sn0w> Pat how bad is RE4's later half, in your most humble opinion? OpieOP
[2:55:15] <$joylent_blue> TELL HIM SUZI
[2:55:16] <%Aydarkzero> and then Wesker came back the same way Palpatine did and had gand kids and a giant bio weapon in space Kappa
[2:55:18] <%BurningLlama777> "Nothing personnel, kid." - Albert Wesker
[2:55:19] <%spongeofmystery> Thing about Wesker is every time he's around I just think "how does he finance these elaborate operations"
[2:55:19] <+TaphexWin> He has a pretty good Teppen deck too!
[2:55:22] <%connos_procrastination> Alvin and the whesker monks
[2:55:24] <%passthehanky> @TheSphereHunter does the T stand for "the?" albert THE wesker
[2:55:25] <+professormorrigan> There's nothing bad about RE4
[2:55:28] <Mcgack2> he ate a whole T virus before leting the tyrant stabble him
[2:55:33] <%ospreyworks> He’s a good villain in the games where he barely shows up.
[2:55:35] <Solidnick18> wesker is is the dumbest cool villian
[2:55:36] <%TheSphereHunter> @passthehanky yes
[2:55:37] <Lionkevinson> Best save music imo
[2:55:38] <Fien111> Honestly I think the island is mostly shit
[2:55:39] <%connos_procrastination> RE4 is godlike
[2:55:39] <djazo> FACT
[2:55:41] <%spiritofmojave> Suzi bringing the Alvin Whiskers lore
[2:55:43] <%passthehanky> @TheSphereHunter thank god
[2:55:45] <$joylent_blue> Albert the Wesker LUL
[2:55:48] <%TheSphereHunter> the island in RE4 is pretty whack
[2:55:48] <%BurningLlama777> I like Krauser's knife.'
[2:55:51] <%BurningLlama777> I'd like one.
[2:55:54] <oyyzzo> hmmmm
[2:55:57] <oniwahoo> Albert of Weskeros
[2:55:57] <%Dakuu75> @cowardman93 I think he was jsut crooked cop for umbrela then was like, "Man, umbrela does some cool bio-shit, I want that." and boom
[2:55:58] <%Aydarkzero> @TheSphereHunter but JJ!
[2:55:59] <%senordingdong2> RE4 controls like trash mixed with AIDs syringes
[2:56:00] <%dukenux> i actually really like a Wesker as an over the top villain
[2:56:01] <jorniev> can you say in what ways he is a bad villain, just want to hear your take on it
[2:56:01] <Clu_Flynn> get real, it goes from a 9.5 to a 6.7
[2:56:02] <SMuffinMan> Re4 is bad fite me
[2:56:02] <+ZephynM> I liked RE4. The merchant was my favorite side dude.
[2:56:02] <SoaringLettuce> it's a ten all throughout but I hate the island
[2:56:02] <bananawarrior1> is he going to play all resident evil games?
[2:56:07] <+machshop> if you think Wesker is dumb, remember that Ocelot fired finger-guns at boats
[2:56:07] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Resident Evil is actually the tale of the Redfield lineage vs Albert Wesker
[2:56:08] <%trekkie11041> The island is the weakest part
[2:56:09] <young_sn0w> I was hoping you'd shit on RE4 island OpieOP
[2:56:10] <CandyCoatedConfection> I wish I liked re4 as much as everyone else seems to 😔
[2:56:11] <Ipsenscastle> CRAZY TALK
[2:56:12] <rcand9> LUL
[2:56:12] <SoaringLettuce> the island sucked
[2:56:12] <%BurningLlama777> What're ye boiyin??
[2:56:17] <+BringBackSempai> does CVX only have 2 enemy types?
[2:56:18] <tiaramaki> I was gonna say, I think that's a respawn thing
[2:56:18] <%Desertfishing> they are now named Pimpslappers
[2:56:19] <rcand9> bye banderstach
[2:56:21] <Fujiwara_92> crazy talk
[2:56:24] <Lionkevinson> Will they remake Veronica?
[2:56:25] <%Validuntil2077> No wesker was a super baby and genius scientist and special forces and also a cop
[2:56:26] <biomegabear> SHOULD BE REMADE
[2:56:27] <+TaphexWin> That merchant did NOT get enough play in future games
[2:56:27] <%passthehanky> "A" problem? code veronica has several problems
[2:56:35] <malletman241> NO ITS INSUFFICIENT PIMP SLAPS
[2:56:35] <%BurningLlama777> "What're ye, Boivin?" Huh? Huuuh? Think about it.
[2:56:36] <djazo> @thespherehunter but better then all of RE CV LUL
[2:56:40] <%Aydarkzero> The Merchant retired
[2:56:41] <oyyzzo> not enough steve
[2:56:44] <regabt> save ammo use knife
[2:56:44] <+professormorrigan> STRANGAH, STRANGAH. NOW THAT'S A WEAPON.
[2:56:49] <%dirtygaijin> You have to force that tension
[2:56:50] <%jillvxlentine> theres not enough ammo in the game to kill everything so yeah
[2:56:52] <%avaleru> sleepy times i think, enjoy the stream people
[2:56:52] <OverzealousEuthanasiast> Code Veronica IS a problem
[2:56:55] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> they only respawns in certain rooms
[2:56:57] <+Papafleish> I'm stupid adoyyyy
[2:56:58] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Wait, it has a problem? No way, improssible Kappa
[2:56:59] <oniwahoo> hehehe thank ye
[2:57:00] <Solidnick18> blap blap
[2:57:00] <Fien111> It's JPRG levels
[2:57:02] <%BurningLlama777> HYEH HYEH HYEH. THANK YEW
[2:57:06] <%connos_procrastination> RE4 islland is still great
[2:57:14] <Lionkevinson> This is the only class RE game I played
[2:57:16] <natebud> RE4 island has good music
[2:57:19] <%Faustgesicht> Hey errybody
[2:57:20] <$joylent_blue> whattaya boy-in
[2:57:21] <%cowardman93> I prefer the island over the castle
[2:57:22] <+ZephynM> Could you imagine getting a job offer some place fancy only to find out when you get there that it requires you to become a zombie?
[2:57:23] <%dukenux> Strangah, STRANGAH, now that's a WEPON
[2:57:26] <%BurningLlama777> Hi @Faustgesicht
[2:57:27] <Lionkevinson> *classic
[2:57:28] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> The island in RE4 was kind of not as good as the village or the castle, but it was way more fun to assault the place with your beefed shit
[2:57:31] <young_sn0w> When will you give us a RE2 randomizer run ariW
[2:57:33] <+professormorrigan> whattaya boivin
[2:57:33] <Fujiwara_92> the whole of CVX is the RE4 island imo
[2:57:34] <+SpoonDawg> WRONG AGAIN PAT
[2:57:39] <%takiyami> Doesn't the core gameplay loop of an RE game involve deciding which areas to clear and which to leave with enemies?
[2:57:41] <%BurningLlama777> @ZephynM They'd have to have amazing health benefits.
[2:57:41] <%Aydarkzero> hehe stranger what do you need that for hunting elephants?
[2:57:42] <%passthehanky> idk why they decided on respawns when enemy placement and permanence was so important to the design of the first 3
[2:57:43] <%nathandiel> Wrong
[2:57:50] <%cowardman93> those dolls are horrifically large
[2:57:57] <djazo> RE4 island had JJ and regin soo yeah still great
[2:58:01] <%davimotion96> EeEeEeEeEeEhH
[2:58:02] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> By that point in the game I had way upgraded weapons and I wanted to goddamned use them
[2:58:03] <natebud> @passthehanky To distract you from the backtracking
[2:58:07] <+TaphexWin> Okay, spicy take time chat, is the TMP ACTUALLY that bad?
[2:58:10] <%takiyami> Like, imagine RE2 but lickers just respawned all the time.
[2:58:12] <%passthehanky> @natebud something has to, i guess
[2:58:18] <young_sn0w> TMP is god-tier
[2:58:18] <+TenguGemini> how do you feel about the Ashford twins as villains?
[2:58:19] <SMuffinMan> RE4 is an escort game, dialogue so cheesy it rivals RE1, and the villains are stupid
[2:58:19] <%connos_procrastination> god im horny for REmake 2 randomizer
[2:58:22] <jorniev> re 3 was made after veronica had already started development right?
[2:58:25] <%Aydarkzero> the TMP is useful on Professional Playthroughs
[2:58:27] <%BurningLlama777> "Meester Kennedy!" "Leon!"
[2:58:27] <%jillvxlentine> you need the red one as well right
[2:58:28] <natebud> TMP is the Do Combo of RE4 weapons
[2:58:29] <CassyASG> guess im one of the few who thought RE 4 was boring
[2:58:29] <+professormorrigan> Regenerators/Iron Maidens spooked me hard in RE4 monkaS
[2:58:30] <+PanicSwytch> Enemies respawning everytime?
[2:58:30] <hardiman9229> dude, I am in England and this is the first time I have ever managed to catch pat live. very happy RN.
[2:58:32] <%dirtygaijin> Has there been any talks of a randomiser option for the R3make?
[2:58:34] <%FirearmsInstructor> ???
[2:58:35] <oyyzzo> gr8 jerb
[2:58:36] <%trekkie11041> @taphexwin I personally don’t find it useful
[2:58:37] <%marsproject> cheer100 Was this game Wesker's first reappearance since RE1
[2:58:42] <%FirearmsInstructor> Why the pause? What did I miss?
[2:58:43] <$joylent_blue> hardiman9229 hey welcome :D
[2:58:44] <regabt> music
[2:58:46] <%BurningLlama777> I screwed up adjusting for time zones and so showed up super late. :(
[2:58:46] <%passthehanky> remake 2 already has wandering zombies so might as well add respawns LUL
[2:58:47] <rytisone> Pat is lost

[2:58:58] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> And the difference is that RE4 was still fun as fuck
[2:58:59] <%BurningLlama777> I'm sad
[2:59:00] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Alright fuck this chat. Here's a hot take: Which FF game has the best battle theme and why is it 5?
[2:59:02] <Lionkevinson> umeYay umeYay umeYay umeYay

[2:59:09] <oyyzzo> hee hee
[2:59:11] <natebud> There's no help for you now. Start backtracking aimlessly like the devlopers intended
[2:59:12] <%TheSphereHunter> watching you play this is giving me intense PTSD
[2:59:13] <%jillvxlentine> for the room in the palace

[2:59:23] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> @L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N unironically FF 8 has the best one

[3:06:31] <JunkyardCrow> Two (2) zombies!? At once!? WutFace
[3:06:32] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I was answering @Eye_of_Hades not u LUL
[3:06:36] <+professormorrigan> moo 🐮
[3:06:38] <Heyestus> Tense music should blast in and fade out
[3:06:41] <%Kegeto> oh i rember
[3:06:42] <%jillvxlentine> YOU PUT THE EAGLE PLATE IN THE TRAINING FACILITY THEN IT GIVES YOU THE INDIGO CARD
[3:06:47] <CaptCatastrophe> RE5 is a good game, just a bad Resident Evil
[3:06:49] <Eye_of_Hades> hmmm i can't remember either
[3:06:49] <oyyzzo> needs more clown farting
[3:06:51] <%NekoUrabe> Doesnt this whole game take place on an island?
[3:06:52] <rcand9> pats first death was a restart
[3:06:52] <%Kegeto> yeah
[3:06:54] <$WackyXmand> @Ipsenscastle can you blame him, some of it is so uncomfortably bland and bad
[3:06:54] <%SvenHolgersson> Resident Evil? What about Neighboring Good
[3:06:56] <%maskofmichael> Is Pat dumb? The answer may surprise you.
[3:06:57] <Fien111> Start remembering or you can never stop playing CVX. The ultimate incentive
[3:06:59] <%cowardman93> RE5 is a product of its time
[3:07:04] <Eye_of_Hades> do you even get it as claire?
[3:07:07] <ultimatemegahero1> No, DSP ruined DSP's partnership opportunities.
[3:07:08] <%AliceAstro> do a big shit in it
[3:07:08] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat ProTip: Think of Paige LUL
[3:07:08] <+CrimPls> Paaaat are you looking forward to Crimson Heads?
[3:07:10] <+BrooklynAIA> did a death happen while I was out?
[3:07:12] <$joylent_blue> Byleth shoulda worked like Pokemon Trainer, he/she stands in the back as Edel/Dimi/Claude do the fighting
[3:07:21] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> RE5 would be 10x better without the piss filter
[3:07:21] <$WackyXmand> god fuck that line so much
[3:07:21] <%necrocannibal2> @SvenHolgersson how about Mensident Evil and it's just for the fellas
[3:07:28] <Ipsenscastle> @WackyXmand I had blocked out the Gackt ending from my memory until he played it again
[3:07:31] <rcand9> BOOO
[3:07:32] <Fien111> @BrooklynAIA Nah, he just loaded an hour old save
[3:07:34] <tiaramaki> @BrooklynAIA No, he quit and reloaded a save that turned out set him quite back
[3:07:35] <rcand9> you hate fun
[3:07:36] <%D3rrtyD4n> redheads are not that big of a deal, so mucha mmo
[3:07:37] <%Validuntil2077> nah crimson heads rock

[3:07:51] <%peachy996> Learn to run past the zombos
[3:07:53] <%FirearmsInstructor> Did Steve even kiss his dad yet? LUL
[3:07:54] <%SvenHolgersson> @necrocannibal2 Ferda boizzzz
[3:07:54] <djazo> there so fucking cool tho
[3:07:58] <+Dingalow> DSP is putting the Xbox Series X and PS5 on his Amazon wishlist so that his fans will buy them for him.
[3:08:00] <ultimatemegahero1> EXACTLY crimson heads are the worst!
[3:08:01] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> but I thought you loved backtracking
[3:08:04] <CoffeeSlice> LUL
[3:08:05] <%D3rrtyD4n> apatDab Zappa
[3:08:09] <%BurningLlama777> Is that a crimson head in your pocket or is Red XIII just happy to see me?
[3:08:10] <%Aydarkzero> Ultra Instinct!?
[3:08:13] <$WackyXmand> @Ipsenscastle Never forget when Gackt inserted himself into all his favorite games
[3:08:14] <%peachy996> See? Now do that in Remake
[3:08:19] <Mishal21S> PogU
[3:08:23] <oyyzzo> using the zapping system and zap to the end
[3:08:23] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Dingalow Too bad they'll take those in bankruptcy
[3:08:24] <+WaywardSera> @Dingalow and you know what? Someone probably will
[3:08:26] <%peachy996> And you'll fight a small amount of Crimson Heads
[3:08:27] <$joylent_blue> christ, DSP's enablers are strange people
[3:08:28] <%dirtygaijin> Well if he didn't spend all his money on gacha...
[3:08:29] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Yo are you guys excited for Frosty and the Faust trailer tommorrow?
[3:08:33] <heartbreak_mermaid> Which version of CV are we on?
[3:08:34] <Ipsenscastle> Alternate history mid-2000s where we got the Compilation of Resident Evil 2 featuring Gackt
[3:08:35] <%Valdorick> Game Theory: Is DPS just The Spoony One in a body suit?
[3:08:36] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Dingalow oh wait no it isnt
[3:08:38] <+Rolandknight> what are you going to leave behind for Chris when he shows up?
[3:08:39] <+Dingalow> Yeah probably
[3:08:43] <SMuffinMan> Every zombie can be ran around in REmake. Just don't kill any. Speedrun stuff.
[3:08:43] <Lionkevinson> Is he using the most overpowered knife?
[3:08:43] <rcand9> nah this crimson head bullshit take wont fly chat squidg7Gross
[3:08:47] <%Aydarkzero> what in the fuck is a gackt?
[3:08:50] <%jillvxlentine> as someone who completed this 4 days ago its extremely hard to watch
[3:08:51] <jorniev> why are you guys soo focused on dsp fuck that guy
[3:08:51] <%redrins> how has dsp stayed afloat with all his bad decisions all these years
[3:08:58] <%BurningLlama777> @Valdorick I'll tell you after I shill my crappy merch for 20 minutes.
[3:09:03] <natebud> This game is just busywork.
[3:09:09] <%Faustgesicht> @Dingalow After the Mortgage and BMW fiasco, does he even have space for the shit?
[3:09:15] <+Dingalow> DSP is a pretty damn good at snaking shit off his fans
[3:09:21] <Xenokhrist> Gackt singlehandedly revived FF7
[3:09:27] <Lionkevinson> Dsp is pretty cool actually
[3:09:31] <$WackyXmand> @AngriestPat gonna bother getting the Magnum or say fuck it?
[3:09:37] <ultimatemegahero1> @redrin It's a mystery science my never solve. :p
[3:09:37] <T_Sasquatch> i thought pat hated this game ?
[3:09:37] <%cowardman93> well shit I gotta sleep as I have work in a few hours, enjoy the stream my dudes
[3:09:39] <%SvenHolgersson> Whens ORC
[3:09:45] <+Dingalow> @Faustgesicht Not likely but fuck if he cares lmao
[3:09:46] <%Aydarkzero> the Magnum is always important
[3:09:47] <rcand9> dsp is ruining chat for other streamers now huh?
[3:09:47] <Lionkevinson> Dsp signed my soccer ball
[3:09:48] <rytisone> *mugnum
[3:09:55] <CandyCoatedConfection> took a quick break but it seems I didn't miss a whole lot.
[3:09:56] <Ipsenscastle> CVX isn't even bad enough to be interesting, it's just so middle-of-the-road mediocre that the chat is all talking about whatever else
[3:09:59] <%dirtygaijin> DSP's life is currently like rose at the end of titanic and all good decisions are jack being drowned while being slowly nudged into the water
[3:10:03] <LordSDB> Gackt is a famous artist/singer in japan. known for his role in ff7 crisis core
[3:10:10] <%Aydarkzero> oh
[3:10:19] <%BurningLlama777> Woooow, I just looked up the fifth Smash Brothers Ultimate DLC character. That is just tragic. X)
[3:10:22] <natebud> DSP is like that guy who cartwheeled to his death in Titanic
[3:10:23] <MelfinaStarwind> how much longer strim
[3:10:27] <%jillvxlentine> you need the indigo card
[3:10:36] <%Aydarkzero> i really hope Crash makes it into Smash
[3:10:38] <%SuperFineButtHairs> SQUISHH
[3:10:41] <%Validuntil2077> god were so far back
[3:10:43] <majima666> doctor nom noms
[3:10:43] <%AnIcedCoffee> Is it bad the only thing I remember about this game is STEEEEVE
[3:10:47] <regabt> big speedy incoming
[3:10:48] <djazo> that secret ending for ff7 doc was the worst thing LUL
[3:10:50] <%necrocannibal2> you interrupted their kiss
[3:10:50] <jorniev> SPOOOPIE
[3:10:51] <%necrocannibal2> again
[3:10:54] <$WackyXmand> good luck, it wasn't until I beat a few bosses in Antarctica that I messed up on getting it
[3:10:55] <Lionkevinson> Wtf
[3:11:04] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Paige would get apatBig PORKED UP if this was hanging in your bedroom.
[3:11:04] <%dirtygaijin> how could you forget the best thing to come out of RE, The Steve
[3:11:05] <Ipsenscastle> STEVE IS THE GACKT OF RE, I just put it together!
[3:11:08] <Lionkevinson> Did he miss a key item?
[3:11:09] <+Dingalow> Phil has a tonne of virgin collectables that Patreon money was put towards lmao
[3:11:09] <MelfinaStarwind> also @angriestpat did you get a good nap in after that terrible direct
[3:11:11] <ultimatemegahero1> Oh is Pat streaming the Nintnendo direct? :)
[3:11:13] <%mrcelab> @BurningLlama777 What is it? dm
[3:11:14] <%lethallunacyx> bad doctor
[3:11:15] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> Hey, it's the first time i catch the stream!
[3:11:16] <natebud> WHo needs ambiance?
[3:11:19] <+el_thag> Keep Gackt in the Deepground...
[3:11:22] <$joylent_blue> man i gotta go back and watch Max's playthrough of DoC, the poor guy
[3:11:25] <+TaphexWin> Does the shotgun in REmake only have a chance to pop heads?
[3:11:31] <DrFacilier> too disappointed
[3:11:32] <%jillvxlentine> he hasnt missed anything hes just doing things the wrong way around lmfao
[3:11:32] <+Dingalow> I hate those fake sleeps
[3:11:32] <%FirearmsInstructor> @EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries notkohWave
[3:11:34] <+Verd_254> Verd_254 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[3:11:35] <%D3rrtyD4n> lol
[3:11:37] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> boy it sucks being an insomniac.
[3:11:42] <natebud> @TaphexWin yes
[3:11:46] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> @FirearmsInstructor hayyy! xd
[3:11:46] <+Jaysky> Played Dirge of Pooparus
[3:11:47] <rcand9> what a shame
[3:11:49] <%SuperFineButtHairs> i woke up early i reget it
[3:11:51] <bear_breaker20> did it suck or something?
[3:11:51] <biomegabear> How is the music in CVX?
[3:11:53] <jorniev> bylenth getting in just makes me hate corrin more
[3:11:54] <%Aydarkzero> remember chat always stay whelmed
[3:11:54] <ultimatemegahero1> Oh it already happened? lol
[3:11:54] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Max watching the Direct was sad
[3:11:55] <%Nina96> he was so excited
[3:11:57] <%D3rrtyD4n> he suffered through Dirge for hours and hours for that
[3:11:57] <%LiquidShake83> why dont you do that too?
[3:11:59] <%AnIcedCoffee> And he finished Dirge of Cerberus LMAO
[3:12:02] <%Mekhet09> I'm glad I slept iin.
[3:12:03] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> It sucks that gackt thinks he's like five or six times more awesome than he his
[3:12:03] <%Verd_254> I'm kinda shocked no one guessed it'd be FE
[3:12:06] <%necrocannibal2> people really deluded themselves huh
[3:12:07] <LordSDB> At least Byleth has more than just a sword......
[3:12:09] <djazo> max and simmons LUL
[3:12:10] <+tweedler92> Then he played more Dirge after....
[3:12:11] <$WackyXmand> @AngriestPat Playing Dirge of Cerberus too so he was extra done with everything
[3:12:11] <ultimatemegahero1> No, Dantw then? :(
[3:12:12] <%FalseEyeD> doodBait doodBait doodBait
[3:12:12] <%spiritofmojave> Was like that watch people die sub, between that and Dirge LUL
[3:12:12] <+starkandstag> doodBait doodBait doodBait doodBait doodBait
[3:12:13] <%Mekhet09> What a waste of a slot.
[3:12:14] <%MayorRev> we got Cuphead doe
[3:12:15] <%dirtygaijin> Max is one of a kind
[3:12:17] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> It's actually because the streamtimes aren't that eu friendly
[3:12:18] <%天使42199> as a fire emblem fan... I'm not mad. but holy shit if I say anything positive about it will I get JUMPED LUL
[3:12:25] <%Mekhet09> Cuphead should have been the character.
[3:12:26] <$joylent_blue> bear_breaker20 they announced the new smash character, Byleth from FE, not even an interesting FE character FeelsBadMan
[3:12:26] <%bread_assassin> He stayed up to while playing Dirge f Cerberus, which makes it even worse.
[3:12:31] <%MayorRev> Cuphead tho PogChamp
[3:12:32] <+StrawberryPantsu> Yall ready for SIX MORE FE REPS?
[3:12:33] <%Mekhet09> And beyleth the mi.
[3:12:36] <+RowenCleric> yea at least CVX is waaaaay better than Dirge of Cerberus
[3:12:37] <+TaphexWin> Not ONLY did he go through all that, he then made the horrible mistake of watching the secret ending to Dirge of Cerberus.
[3:12:41] <rcand9> is 3 houses even good i know no one who beat it?
[3:12:41] <jorniev> after the direct max had to beat dirge of cerberus
[3:12:42] <Lionkevinson> Fire emblem ultimate
[3:12:44] <%SvenHolgersson> Why hasn't there been a Resident Evil where you play a retail worker in a zombie apocalypse
[3:12:50] <natebud> hold up or die
[3:12:51] <+WhackyChiraqi> I just added remote operated LEDs to my fish's tank. With the push of a button I can change the color and the flashing patterns. I bet Pat would really like the remote considering it is tank controls
[3:12:52] <%valriot> @angriestpat I don't think Byleth is a bad choice, it's perfectly reasonable, it's just not hype and completely expected and not a big deal at all
[3:12:54] <LordSDB> no your good @angel42199. we all about hot takes!
[3:12:57] <%天使42199> @rcand9 3 houses is the best fe of recent days
[3:12:58] <%FalseEyeD> doodCrazy thesph1SUELUV clempsComfy apatSmug
[3:13:00] <bear_breaker20> @joylent_blue but it wasnt just smash was it ? I thought it was a full one with animal crossing soon
[3:13:01] <%SvenHolgersson> It's always cops or waifus smdh
[3:13:02] <%AnIcedCoffee> @AngriestPat actually when's your DoC playthrough? apatSmug
[3:13:03] <$joylent_blue> angel42199 gameplay-wise Byleth looks pretty cool tbh, people are just blinded by disappointment
[3:13:04] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Gimme RE: Bus Driver edition.
[3:13:04] <spiritofmojave> Will say I loved Sakurai fucking with everyone, including whatever that Binary stuff was
[3:13:06] <%BurningLlama777> @SvenHolgersson I'd play that. Have your character's power stem from their repressed retail rage.
[3:13:07] <%dirtygaijin> @SvenHolgersson because all retail workers are already dead inside
[3:13:10] <%Wrashis> i like 3 houses and even im like they should have waited for season 2 for byleth if me had to come in
[3:13:11] <jorniev> dirge of cerberus is worse tahn this fart gas
[3:13:14] <Fien111> No
[3:13:19] <$joylent_blue> bear_breaker20 nope, 40 minutes of Byleth
[3:13:19] <+el_thag> @svenholgersson I suppose Outbreak is the nearest to that
[3:13:20] <$WackyXmand> oh yeah and I'm 6"2
[3:13:21] <mobiusnightshade> Why does gas room theme sound like a Final Fantasy theme?
[3:13:22] <srkAres> no you couldnt
[3:13:23] <%BurningLlama777> @dirtygaijin Ohhhhhhh SHIT LUL
[3:13:23] <+TaphexWin> Oh, Dirge is WAY worse than CVX
[3:13:24] <%SuperFineButtHairs> did pat do a 3 house play through?
[3:13:25] <%eiightbiitt> apatWrong
[3:13:26] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat The funny thing is the answer to your question is literally IN FRAME right now. LUL
[3:13:27] <%Desertfishing> yes and it fucks my back up
[3:13:29] <Xenokhrist> yeah DoC is real bad
[3:13:31] <+StrawberryPantsu> clempsMischief
[3:13:32] <%Validuntil2077> dude i got the scoliosis shit sucks
[3:13:33] <Ipsenscastle> At least there's not a camera on you showing over 1000 people your ape body
[3:13:34] <%BurningLlama777> Soul is dead, can confirm.
[3:13:38] <%Aydarkzero> fast zombo
[3:13:40] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> @SvenHolgersson they're already dead inside, they don't need a virus to be classed as zombies
[3:13:40] <%necrocannibal2> what did you guys think of MK11 Joker?
[3:13:43] <%Verd_254> @rcand9 I've yet to touch it myself but if you like turn based strategy and waifus then it seems like a fantastic game
[3:13:46] <+StrawberryPantsu> DoC was okay...
[3:13:48] <nademonkey1100> get fucked zombo
[3:13:48] <natebud> Does this game not have a quickturn?
[3:13:49] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Hey i'm back what did I miss
[3:13:50] <TonberryLives> lol
[3:13:50] <%Wrashis> pat streamed the middle of a 3h playthrough for 1 stream
[3:13:50] <%Aydarkzero> MK 11 Joker looks alright
[3:13:50] <+razielhex> creeeeeeeeeeeeeeeak
[3:13:53] <$WackyXmand> he wants that Claire ass
[3:13:54] <%spiritofmojave> Dirge is easily worse than this to experience
[3:13:55] <+Dingalow> What's DoC?
[3:13:57] <%天使42199> I'm not a fan of my 11 but joker looked cool
[3:13:57] <tiaramaki> Me going to McDonald's at 8:30 in the morning like
[3:13:57] <Lionkevinson> Yes
[3:14:04] <%necrocannibal2> he was honestly way better than I expected
[3:14:07] <%SoFarFetched> STUPID BIRDS
[3:14:09] <$joylent_blue> FE isnt just about waifus guys, its also about husbandos okay
[3:14:09] <%天使42199> mk 11*
[3:14:12] <thetruthofyourbeing> Claire is so thicc not gonna lie
[3:14:13] <+TaphexWin> @Dingalow Dirge of Cerberus
[3:14:13] <%MayorRev> everyone who wanted style switching in DMC3 has ignored the curled monkey paw finger
[3:14:13] <mobiusnightshade> @Dingalow Dirge of Cerberus
[3:14:16] <%FirearmsInstructor> @SoFarFetched EXACTLY
[3:14:17] <%MalekDracarus> Catchem Dery
[3:14:18] <djazo> cvx is a masterpiece compared to DOV LUL
[3:14:19] <+Dingalow> Gotcha
[3:14:20] <+Jaysky> It's the fact that they used a Fire Emblem character, an already over repped series to top off the first DLC pack as if that will get people excited to pre-purchace challenger pack 2
[3:14:22] <%SuperFineButtHairs> @necrocannibal2 he looks fantastic, way better than injustice which is suprising
[3:14:22] <%necrocannibal2> thought they were just going to bring Injustice Joker and call it a day
[3:14:22] <LordSDB> Joker new moveset is great
[3:14:23] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> Or rather: because retail workers are already dead inside, they can't be distinguished from the zombies, right @AngriestPat ?
[3:14:24] <djazo> doc
[3:14:24] <%Validuntil2077> it feels like joker has been run into the ground since dark knight to me
[3:14:25] <%dirtygaijin> Mk11 Joker for some reason makes me think of Conner with face paint, just the face
[3:14:29] <rcand9> i'll check out 3 houses when i have the chance then
[3:14:32] <$joylent_blue> LUL
[3:14:37] <%Mekhet09> Did joker get any rebalances?
[3:14:40] <%Jekado> he didn't know to save...
[3:14:41] <TheSegaDreamcast> Did you do the portrait puzzle yet?
[3:14:42] <rcand9> LUL
[3:14:52] <djazo> what LUL
[3:14:53] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> Dirge is JUST good enough to not be totally broken
[3:14:54] <rcand9> how can both be true? PogChamp
[3:14:55] <Ipsenscastle> You have good reflexes and no brain
[3:14:56] <thetruthofyourbeing> no knife only?
[3:15:00] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Just because you're knowledgeable doesn't mean you're not absolute shit.
[3:15:05] <+TaphexWin> Cant wait to see him do the oil presssure puzzle
[3:15:05] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> But that doesn't mean it doesn't suck
[3:15:06] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Or incompetent
[3:15:07] <Fien111> You're so bad you even fuck up sucking at this game
[3:15:11] <%peachy996> "The only reason the game feels-SHIT SHIT SHIT- easy to you.."
[3:15:11] <%MayorRev> damn dude
[3:15:12] <%Aydarkzero> how can we see if our eyes aren't real
[3:15:18] <$WackyXmand> @AngriestPat you have the RE expert air about you which makes people trust with your opinions about the RE series
[3:15:25] <+el_thag> The cut online mode for Dirge might’ve help it
[3:15:25] <%Storm_Samurai> Somehow Pat will make it true
[3:15:26] <natebud> You know the ultimate secret of how the first weapon you get is OP. No one could have figured that out without being an RE master.
[3:15:28] <%maskofmichael> Knowledge doesn't equal skill
[3:15:31] <rcand9> thats a real sokrates problem
[3:15:35] <%lethallunacyx> man you're good at this game why you so bad?
[3:15:38] <+OhNoItsTVHead> we ask ourselves that every day Pat
[3:15:42] <+Dingalow> There is genuinely something off about the way Claire moves. It's mainly the fact that readying a weapon forces her backwards slightly
[3:15:50] <djazo> RE fans have the hottest take pat don.t worry LUL
[3:15:59] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat BTW That's not directed *TO YOU* I mean "in general" knowledge does not equate to competence / mastery (though it helps)
[3:16:07] <%jillvxlentine> you needed to put the eagle plate in the training facility upstairs where you saw alfred
[3:16:09] <%Aydarkzero> @AngriestPat hey pat you check out the new Osiris mission?
[3:16:10] <%Wrashis> pat has turning into zombie face and im not sure if this is a bit or not
[3:16:13] <%BurningLlama777> "I don't think I'll be using that machine again." Well somebody's confident.
[3:16:21] <rcand9> close the game again

[3:16:47] <%BurningLlama777> Let's all play Enter the Gungeon instead. :D
[3:16:59] <$WackyXmand> something about how Pat plays RE games just shows that his knowledge of all of them helps whenever he plays one, if that makes sense
[3:17:02] <$joylent_blue> that's a great sign
[3:17:03] <%scaryboisupreme> I feel weird for knowing every puzzle solution in this game
[3:17:04] <%Dementedpenguin> @Wrashis I mean earlier he flatout said the game is boring. LUL
[3:17:05] <%lethallunacyx> but then again I've played them all multiple times

[3:18:25] <+TaphexWin> I think you can exhaust the biohazard card at this point
[3:18:29] <%BurningLlama777> @zenith0111 They have to adjust it for their Stadia exclusivity.

[3:27:12] <rcand9> poor pat
[3:27:14] <+RestiveGaming> @heyestus its pretty much the true re3 as the actual re3 has no baring on the narrative at all while this continues the story
[3:27:15] <+swaggopotamus> But it was right there.
[3:27:15] <%FalseEyeD> apatBig apatHoldon

[3:27:53] <majima666> doing any of the remasters pat?
[3:27:53] <Solidnick18> yakuza kart
[3:27:53] <%SoFarFetched> Watch Yakuza 7 comes out around the time Cyberpunk 2020 does.
[3:27:53] <Fujiwara_92> yeah you should
[3:28:00] <Arweynn> the same time as ff7 cyberpunk and re 3, of course :>
[3:28:08] <tripessolides> i hope you did the kamurocho pervs sidequests
[3:28:08] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> Well, laptop's about to die and it's 1:30. Enjoy the stream y'all!
[3:28:09] <%jillvxlentine> you need to backtrack and look everywhere in this area
[3:28:09] <%dirtygaijin> ive not finished yakuza 2 yet :(
[3:28:10] <CoffeeSlice> hHHHhh
[3:28:12] <%D3rrtyD4n> im for yakuza 7 because it looks wacky
[3:28:12] <+TaphexWin> You did it
[3:28:12] <munchkay> Is Yakuza 7 completely detached from the main story?
[3:28:13] <zenith0111> Judgement 👎
[3:28:14] <%FirearmsInstructor> Well FUCK I guess?
[3:28:16] <%jcflyguy> But Ass Ketchum tho
[3:28:17] <%Chichen> @Arweynn Cyberpunk got delayed to september
[3:28:17] <%Aydarkzero> just figure it out 4Head
[3:28:19] <$WackyXmand> man that cutscene where the main character is armor about to fight a dragon is dope and dumb, i kinda love it
[3:28:20] <rcand9> but side quests usually make yakusa great??
[3:28:22] <CassyASG> oh geez...
[3:28:22] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> Cyberpunk isn't for a long ass time now
[3:28:26] <+zanzibar_junker> Been watching the Japanese vtubers stream of it and it's good
[3:28:29] <%bread_assassin> How far ya get in Judgment?
[3:28:29] <+dante_must_die_exe> do it for the judgement eyes
[3:28:30] <%D3rrtyD4n> judgement didnt do it for me
[3:28:30] <%AnIcedCoffee> at least finish the main story, it's really good
[3:28:31] <+RestiveGaming> @angriestpat you may dislike this game, but you gotta admit it has some potential for a phenominal remake.
[3:28:35] <%天使42199> September? ooof
[3:28:35] <Mishal21S> Whole section
[3:28:37] <Jarvanii> there are some good side stories in judgment but there's way more timesink in them than yakuza's
[3:28:45] <djazo> @angriestpat judgment had the best secret boss in all of yakuza
[3:28:57] <+zanzibar_junker> Yagami immediately disarms and unloads guns
[3:28:58] <rcand9> true
[3:29:00] <%jillvxlentine> THANK GOD
[3:29:03] <natebud> If it makes you feel any better, this is the average CVX experience.
[3:29:04] <zenith0111> True
[3:29:08] <Mishal21S> True
[3:29:08] <rytisone> Dino Crisis
[3:29:11] <%BurningLlama777> Remake Quest 64
[3:29:11] <majima666> big rigs remake when?
[3:29:14] <%logoth_> yes Castlevania judgement is a good game
[3:29:14] <Heyestus> Yeah but it's more likely to be better if you remake a bad game
[3:29:16] <SoaringLettuce> this game had a chance to not exist. GOT EM
[3:29:16] <thetruthofyourbeing> Also has the potential to be way worse
[3:29:18] <+TaphexWin> I wish theyd remake dino crisis
[3:29:19] <%天使42199> remake skyrim
[3:29:19] <%FalseEyeD> Dino Crisis can never be good
[3:29:24] <%BurningLlama777> Add the ability to buy healing items. That wasn't in the original game.
[3:29:24] <biomegabear> but no one is remaking dead aim
[3:29:28] <oyyzzo> can't remake SOUL
[3:29:28] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> I mean but if you change too much is it even the same game?
[3:29:30] <rcand9> does bubsy 3d thoooo?
[3:29:31] <$joylent_blue> Steve can only be fixed by making a completely different character
[3:29:32] <zenith0111> Like of course if it was a different game it has a chance to be better LUL
[3:29:33] <%Nina96> ride to hell remake when? @AngriestPat
[3:29:34] <%OldOnyx> omikron remake when?
[3:29:34] <%Valdorick> Valdorick subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! I have no idea what to put here, so I'll just say: FUCK ME ITS JANUARY
[3:29:35] <natebud> "If they take out all the bad stuff, maybe this game will be good"
[3:29:38] <%Aydarkzero> lmao
[3:29:40] <+swaggopotamus> I bet this game looked pretty good and grungy on a CRT.
[3:29:40] <munchkay> But then you get shit like Majora's Mask 3D
[3:29:42] <majima666> dino crisis 1 is hard as fuck
[3:29:46] <%天使42199> omicron remake PogChamp
[3:29:48] <red_blaster> Dino Crisis 2 is better
[3:29:49] <%D3rrtyD4n> i heard dino crisis 2 is better....?
[3:29:49] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> you had a mirror nearby?
[3:29:49] <+swaggopotamus> Or at least for that era.
[3:29:50] <BigHugs> Dino Crisis 2 is still good at least
[3:29:51] <tanzanite_azure> RE outbreak remake
[3:29:51] <%D3rrtyD4n> i dunno
[3:29:52] <%Mekhet09> Why would someone make a painting of a room as it is?
[3:29:53] <+TaphexWin> Then there's the third game
[3:29:54] <$MildConviction> petition to remake a good game into something worse
[3:29:55] <thetruthofyourbeing> Didnt capcom renew the license recently?
[3:29:57] <%spiritofmojave> Wow this vaccum of garbage has SO much potential if it was remade
[3:29:59] <+TaphexWin> Space dinos and shieeet
[3:29:59] <%logoth_> but Regina has huge honkers
[3:30:03] <rcand9> dino crisis not even once
[3:30:03] <$joylent_blue> wait what was wrong with Marjora's Mask 3D
[3:30:05] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Oh man now I really don't want to play it again
[3:30:06] <FaderPotater> yeah people were way ahead of me with omicron
[3:30:07] <%traytr> o
[3:30:08] <majima666> i do prefer dc1 over 2 though. 2 was too much action for me
[3:30:08] <jorniev> i really like dino 2 cause its more actiony
[3:30:16] <pineapple_pizza0> Dino crisis 2 is total hot garbage
[3:30:17] <%traytr> Omikron remake would terrify me
[3:30:21] <$joylent_blue> majora, rather
[3:30:21] <%天使42199> the idea of dino crisis is cool as shit. they could totally remake it
[3:30:24] <%BurningLlama777> Hey just change the mechanics, graphics, plot and name and you'll have a great remake of just about anything!
[3:30:26] <%Wrashis> people were mad because the moon looked bad i think
[3:30:26] <+zanzibar_junker> Dino Crisis 2 is miles better
[3:30:26] <Heyestus> I mean it's better than OG RE1 was
[3:30:29] <%Skittlesoul> look it up
[3:30:30] <red_blaster> Dino Crisis 3 is the best
[3:30:34] <%D3rrtyD4n> i never got into that series
[3:30:35] <jorniev> fuck that
[3:30:35] <%FirearmsInstructor> @traytr D:
[3:30:36] <+RestiveGaming> @angriestpat you know what I mean. the pieces in this have potential to be good, they are just rough. like alfreds insanity reworked with todays quality of gaming storytelling?
[3:30:37] <%dirtygaijin> Escape from Bug Island remake when?
[3:30:45] <%Aydarkzero> damn
[3:30:47] <zenith0111> Is Dino Crisis just Jurassic Park?
[3:30:47] <Lionkevinson> U ha shock
[3:30:48] <%lethallunacyx> when I saw your face I was shocked.
[3:30:48] <%dukenux> Back from a nap
[3:30:50] <natebud> At least DIno Crisis has a marketable premise.
[3:30:50] <$joylent_blue> then don't look at the moon 4Head
[3:30:51] <MattDemers> MHWIB save erasure has been fixed!
[3:30:52] <%jillvxlentine> you need to go put the eagle plate upstairs outside
[3:30:52] <FunTruker> lies
[3:30:53] <%BurningLlama777> The best Omikron remake was Inside.
[3:30:55] <CoffeeSlice> DC3 is the definition of the worst
[3:30:57] <%Validuntil2077> like parasite eve
[3:30:58] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Rusty's Real Deal Baseball remake when?
[3:30:59] <MattDemers> Or well, patch is out
[3:31:00] <$WackyXmand> I haven't even been here that long and this is already frustrating me
[3:31:02] <+KENTASHIRO> It could be worse, it could be a series with no good games like (insert your favorite series here)
[3:31:02] <%D3rrtyD4n> lol
[3:31:03] <%dukenux> Was DC 1 not good?
[3:31:04] <%Wrashis> yeah dont look at the moon in majoras mask
[3:31:04] <%knightofquills> knightofquills subscribed at Tier 2. 
[3:31:05] <+saadi90> They should remaster/remake Parasite Eve 1 and 2
[3:31:06] <jorniev> remember the tank!? or the flare gun sequence!?
[3:31:06] <%connos_procrastination> local canadian mans soul leaves body during CVX playthrough
[3:31:06] <FunTruker> DC1 and 2 are great
[3:31:07] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> das fine
[3:31:08] <%Skittlesoul> !uptime
[3:31:08] <%D3rrtyD4n> we do it
[3:31:08] <%dirtygaijin> Dino Crisis 2 fooled me into playing the first one
[3:31:08] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 31m.
[3:31:10] <%mrcelab> Dino Crisis was with the Gigantosaurus?
[3:31:12] <majima666> 40 part stream
[3:31:14] <%Chichen> this RE game is PAINFULLY long
[3:31:17] <$MildConviction> and assuming you don't lose another hour of play time
[3:31:20] <thatWaulfyguy> yeah if you keep reloading saves from an hour ago we'll be hear through next week
[3:31:22] <%dukenux> Also yeah, Parasite Eve Remaster would be great
[3:31:23] <+CrimPls> What's bad about DC1 Pat? I enjoyed it, was just hard.
[3:31:24] <CassyASG> i know at some point you go under the tank outside
[3:31:25] <%jillvxlentine> YES
[3:31:25] <munchkay> @joylent_blue Fetures that were though made on purpose, that also made the game much fun, were removed or "fixed" but they took away fun features
[3:31:27] <%dukenux> Remake even
[3:31:29] <%Basch71> Code Veronica's a slog
[3:31:31] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat Split up the stream, do half this and half a GOOD RE game
[3:31:31] <%FalseEyeD> bUt sPEedRuN tIMe
[3:31:33] <+RestiveGaming> @saadi90 sadly thatd be hard as hell with the weird rights issues
[3:31:36] <natebud> hey, at least you can look forward to the Albanoid
[3:31:41] <%天使42199> yeah woo were not even at Antarctica yet. this will take a few streams
[3:31:43] <%connos_procrastination> its mostly puzzles
[3:31:45] <jorniev> dino crisis 2 has one major flaw worse than anything, that one underwater section
[3:31:49] <%Aydarkzero> wait what
[3:31:49] <%dukenux> oof
[3:31:50] <%D3rrtyD4n> i hate that
[3:31:50] <$WackyXmand> Does the worm give you anything when you kill it?
[3:31:51] <rcand9> thats pretty poo
[3:31:53] <red_blaster> The biggest problem about Dino Crisis 1 is that the entire game takes place in a lab, and that's really boring
[3:31:55] <+CuddlyKaiju> "you're extinct"
[3:31:58] <tiaramaki> A part of me thinks this game might take three streams
[3:32:00] <+TaphexWin> Getting the two disks wasnt too great
[3:32:00] <%FalseEyeD> The environments are snoozers
[3:32:01] <natebud> So, what if every enemy was a crimson head?
[3:32:04] <+Zutrax> but dinosaurs....
[3:32:08] <%jillvxlentine> OH SWEET JESUS THANK U
[3:32:12] <rcand9> but 2 is good?
[3:32:14] <thetruthofyourbeing> I forgot about that shit. rose tinted glasses i guess oof
[3:32:14] <%dirtygaijin> Id play the shit out of a remake though
[3:32:16] <ovan20> dino crisis is the only game in RE style that has puzzles LUL
[3:32:16] <%mrcelab> Damn, the Parasite EVE remake would be AWESOME
[3:32:21] <$joylent_blue> munchkay mmm i see
[3:32:22] <munchkay> Ypu could say it's a CRISIS of a game LUL
[3:32:22] <%Thalchampz> ..2 is more of an action game
[3:32:23] <majima666> i much prefer the atmosphere compared to 2. dc2 is still a good game but it was too much action for me
[3:32:29] <%FalseEyeD> DC2 has the worst ending of all-time
[3:32:30] <+RowenCleric> wait why tranquiizers?
[3:32:31] <majima666> one raptor could mess you up in dc1
[3:32:34] <+RestiveGaming> @rcand9 Dino Crisis 2 is to 1 like re4 is to re2
[3:32:42] <+Ml33tninja> Not exactly the best judge on puzzles pat
[3:32:45] <%Basch71> I remember 2 being very easy
[3:32:49] <%connos_procrastination> parasite eve remake so i dont have to emulate or do the swap trick lmao
[3:32:50] <jorniev> extincion points
[3:32:52] <%dukenux> Spooky hallway
[3:32:52] <$WackyXmand> @mrcelab a remake to that would be HOT!
[3:32:54] <%Jamejarrs> Jamejarrs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! Pet the baby!
[3:33:02] <munchkay> @joylent_blue Just an example, fast Zora swimming takes up magic, for some reason?
[3:33:10] <biomegabear> THEY WILL NEVER REMAKE DINO CRISIS
[3:33:12] <rcand9> @RestiveGaming but i prefer 2 over 4?
[3:33:17] <%lethallunacyx> Parasite Eve though, that game fucks.
[3:33:18] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Do you have the biohazard card key for the shutters?
[3:33:18] <%FalseEyeD> No Rotation
[3:33:22] <+CrimPls> Idk Pat if you played smartly in DC1 it was possible to kill most of the raptors. Even without poison darts.
[3:33:23] <thetruthofyourbeing> THEY WILL REMAKE DINO CRISIS
[3:33:26] <+TaphexWin> @AngriestPat have you ever played Riven or anything myst related?
[3:33:27] <xanderfist> never say never
[3:33:28] <%mrcelab> @WackyXmand I loved the PE2
[3:33:29] <%FirearmsInstructor> oh yeah ok good
[3:33:32] <+RestiveGaming> @rcand9 i mean in the difference in gameplay
[3:33:34] <%Aydarkzero> that Dino Crisis license just feels like it's for Teppen tbh
[3:33:40] <%BurningLlama777> When did "rotate your saves" stop being a thing? :O
[3:33:46] <%Jamejarrs> Imagine an RE2 style Dino Crisis remake
[3:33:48] <$joylent_blue> munchkay wait it does? in the original it was just the magic swimming that did
[3:33:51] <%天使42199> @munchkay would any of those be issues to someone who never played the OG? I have MM on 3ds but havent played it yet
[3:33:51] <%NovaKnightmare> that track sounds like its gonna Dorime me
[3:33:54] <majima666> regina is pretty awesome tbf though
[3:33:55] <%dukenux> Myst is ALL puzzle games, no?
[3:33:56] <oyyzzo> haha ur old
[3:33:58] <%jillvxlentine> yeah pat you should be rotating your saves
[3:34:01] <%dukenux> and exploration
[3:34:02] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> Jesus christ the Riven speedrun is insane
[3:34:03] <rcand9> @RestiveGaming oh i getchu more big action?
[3:34:04] <%connos_procrastination> macklunky
[3:34:04] <%FirearmsInstructor> Oh shit Riven.... @TaphexWin damn that's a ways back
[3:34:05] <%jillvxlentine> incase you get stuck
[3:34:05] <majima666> even if she is just jill with red hair
[3:34:11] <the_millenial_falcon> Dino Crisis remake in RE engine would be dope
[3:34:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I beat all the Myst games
[3:34:15] <$WackyXmand> @mrcelab it just sucks that the ff13 lead guy ruined the series
[3:34:16] <+RestiveGaming> dino crisis 2 is super actiony and bought hard into it. dino crisis 1 is just budget re with dinosaurs
[3:34:20] <PkSilent01> @angriestpat thoughts on cyberpunks delay?
[3:34:21] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> For how long can they remake Resident Evil games without people noticing that they're all the same game?
[3:34:23] <%Wrashis> i can imagine pat not being good at a game that has a lot of puzzles and not a lot of telling you where to go or what to do
[3:34:24] <+TaphexWin> Myst is ENTIRELY puzzles
[3:34:25] <%connos_procrastination> reginas pussy is poggers i just know it
[3:34:31] <Heyestus> Watching Pat play Myt must be like watching paraplegic people compete in the long jump
[3:34:36] <$sl8r4l8r> DAMMIT STEVE
[3:34:37] <%Aydarkzero> delays are good
[3:34:37] <natebud> Did you know? in a recent poll CVX was rated the worst game of the millenium.
[3:34:37] <+LeonPup> is RE4 next? Will you play remake or the original?
[3:34:38] <%FalseEyeD> Good news for RE3 and FF7
[3:34:38] <munchkay> @joylent_blue yup, only the shield took magic, but now if you want to go fast, use magic
[3:34:49] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Damn Steve is a badass
[3:34:50] <$WackyXmand> gotta make Keanu's face even more breathtaking
[3:34:51] <%jillvxlentine> SECOND FLOOR
[3:34:52] <+RestiveGaming> @angriestpat you gonna knife alexander for that cool cutscene?
[3:34:52] <$MildConviction> cyberpunk is the type of game that screamed "one more delay"
[3:34:52] <ape_hawk> do you think 2020 is barren of good games?
[3:34:53] <%dukenux> Save for a schedule
[3:34:55] <%mrcelab> @WackyXmand true true
[3:34:59] <%Ion_Laser> delaying games for long stretches of time need to happen more often
[3:35:01] <%dirtygaijin> iron out those bugs, the delay will be nothing but good things
[3:35:03] <%Rngiddion> April was looking fucking scary, im glad it cleared up a bit
[3:35:12] <Mishal21S> Cyberpunk is better for next gen
[3:35:12] <%jillvxlentine> apatWhat
[3:35:13] <+Dingalow> Every time the internet has a collective meltdown towards delays I just want to punch my monitor
[3:35:14] <+CrimPls> Do you think they delayed Cyberpunk because of FF7?
[3:35:14] <rcand9> remake or 0 are next i think chat
[3:35:15] <%Chichen> do it
[3:35:15] <KaliasTV> All games should be delayed to the Cyberpunk release
[3:35:18] <%connos_procrastination> you know shes barren
[3:35:19] <%D3rrtyD4n> could cyber punk come out on ps5?
[3:35:20] <tanzanite_azure> Save scum it
[3:35:22] <zenith0111> Yeah Delays are omissions the didn't plan well enough so I appreciate it
[3:35:23] <$joylent_blue> munchkay that's so strange i played the 3DS version and don't remember that, interesting!
[3:35:26] <delta0093> pat are you going to play doom eternal when it comes out?
[3:35:27] <plushy__poo> is CVX good? i missed most of the stream
[3:35:28] <+Grayhammatter> so, what you're saying is you're bad?
[3:35:29] <djazo> you.r not Alexander
[3:35:30] <%Aydarkzero> every month up until June i think i got something to play
[3:35:30] <T_Sasquatch> i hate how people act "mature" about delays, sure its always a positive but I can still be dissapointed
[3:35:30] <%天使42199> Cyberpunk honestly ain't even on my list tbh. Now remake 3 ff7 remake and Doom Eternal - that's the good shit
[3:35:31] <%necrocannibal2> you're not Alexander
[3:35:33] <%spiritofmojave> Watch Cyberpunk be a massive disappointment

[3:35:40] <+TaphexWin> Zombies? In MY Resident evil?
[3:35:42] <%Dementedpenguin> Jesus, this game and its dramatic noises on zombies.

[3:35:44] <%SvenHolgersson> FUCK PAT YOU GOTTA WARN ME
[3:35:45] <+RestiveGaming> im so happy the emulated cvx on ps4 instead of porting the remaster
[3:35:45] <majima666> it just screams cross gen
[3:35:47] <natebud> ALBANOID HYPE
[3:35:48] <rcand9> YEEEE

[3:36:00] <%mrcelab> T pose
[3:36:02] <rcand9> Fear the albanoid
[3:36:02] <dreu81> oh no... not the albinoid.

[3:36:19] <Arek_1> Look at that vagery.
[3:36:20] <majima666> really, all they had to do was make the remaster a bit brighter and it would be fine
[3:36:21] <the_millenial_falcon> The ALBANOID is the scariest monster in the series hands down
[3:36:24] <+Dingalow> Oh god the albinoid! Let's hope you're able to just completely ignore it making the build up stupid
[3:36:26] <+RestiveGaming> This version still has the infinite ammo glitch doesnt it?
[3:36:27] <natebud> ALBANOID is the best boss in any RE game
[3:36:27] <XenoirTheNecromancer> why was there a fish vagina?
[3:36:28] <%jillvxlentine> THE MONITOR
[3:36:28] <$sl8r4l8r> fear the albinoid, it's dissapointment is deadly
[3:36:30] <%Owkono> AVIOD THE NOID
[3:36:31] <$WackyXmand> @mrcelab PE is a cool series but everyone who worked on after the first game clearly wanted a different vision for the series
[3:36:33] <+TaphexWin> Gonna admit I was mad disappointed when the "boss fight" happened with the alby
[3:36:34] <Alseid> this is racist against Albanians
[3:36:34] <%MayorRev> @angriestpat did Steve die yet
[3:36:34] <%FalseEyeD> V A G Monster
[3:36:35] <dreu81> its mouth is a perginer
[3:36:37] <%BurningLlama777> Albinoid and the Chipmunks.
[3:36:38] <%D3rrtyD4n> i dont remember the albanoid
[3:36:40] <%spiritofmojave> I STAY NOIDED
[3:36:43] <%BurningLlama777> "AL-BIIIIN"
[3:36:44] <rcand9> its sooo scary
[3:36:45] <%valriot> Jessica Albanoid PogChamp PogChamp
[3:36:46] <Mishal21S> Check the computer
[3:36:48] <%天使42199> is the albinos that monster you fight in the water?
[3:36:48] <+Grayhammatter> avoid the noid
[3:36:51] <rcand9> big shivers
[3:36:52] <%spongeofmystery> Albinoid Wesker
[3:36:52] <$joylent_blue> angel42199 to answer your majora's mask question, i played both versions and ended up enjoying the 3DS one just fine, its definitely not "bad" by most standards
[3:36:57] <%jillvxlentine> PAT YOU DIDNT LOOK AT THE MONITOR
[3:36:59] <+dheng1> Don’t forget the g launcher
[3:37:00] <rcand9> big spook
[3:37:00] <%connos_procrastination> get noided
[3:37:01] <bearalin> Why does that look like a uterus?
[3:37:04] <Mishal21S> @angriestpat Check the computer back there
[3:37:06] <+SpoonDawg> whats worse, CV or RE0?
[3:37:08] <%Mekhet09> Maybe we should have used something better than a fucking salamander.
[3:37:09] <munchkay> @taphexwin plz ignore what I sent, it was an accident, sorry man
[3:37:12] <%connos_procrastination> CV
[3:37:14] <%BurningLlama777> Controversial Opinion: Majora's Mask is pretty darn spiffy.
[3:37:15] <Fujiwara_92> CV for sure
[3:37:20] <majima666> ill still say 0 is worse than cv
[3:37:23] <rcand9> cv x is prob worse than 0
[3:37:26] <%天使42199> @joylent_blue figured. That's good to hear. I'd like to get through it at some point
[3:37:33] <rytisone> my precious G
[3:37:34] <%BurningLlama777> Fierce Deity crew represent
[3:37:34] <natebud> The Albanoid is so tough and cool.
[3:37:36] <the_millenial_falcon> 0 wouldn't suck so bad if it had item boxes
[3:37:38] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @bearalin girl pwh
[3:37:40] <majima666> at least code veronicas story is funny dumb
[3:37:43] <%MayorRev> are 5 and 6 any good
[3:37:43] <$joylent_blue> Majora's Mask is fantastic, enjoy :D
[3:37:44] <GUNxSPECTRE> But 0 has the Rebecca-Wesker skin
[3:37:45] <natebud> I wish the albanoid was my dad
[3:37:46] <Heyestus> 0 seems much shorter than this game
[3:37:46] <+Dingalow> CV is fucking god tier compared to 0
[3:37:49] <Tucker0603> @AngriestPat thoughts on Iceborne's final boss? I love it and it's beta set
[3:37:50] <%天使42199> @burningllama777 a lot of people say Majoras Mask is great
[3:37:52] <rcand9> i dont mind the stupid animal but big of 0
[3:38:00] <%jillvxlentine> yay
[3:38:05] <djazo> they could easily fix 0
[3:38:07] <+TaphexWin> @munchkay all good, I was looking away so I didn't even see it
[3:38:07] <%BurningLlama777> @天使42199 I was being facetious. ;)
[3:38:08] <$MildConviction> at least 0 has rebecca's sportswear costume
[3:38:10] <%dirtygaijin> So glad its out for PC now
[3:38:11] <%connos_procrastination> Rebbecaweskerdomdotjaypeg
[3:38:13] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat Update for MHW came out. Doesnt fix most issues for people.
[3:38:13] <$WackyXmand> this game is just running around opening door to get to other doors to open
[3:38:14] <%天使42199> @burningllama777 ah gotcha
[3:38:15] <%Validuntil2077> 0 at least look like hot garbage and has a good sidekick
[3:38:18] <%Konquerer> apatGoblin apatGoblin
[3:38:18] <%jillvxlentine> chris chris chris
[3:38:20] <+RestiveGaming> Is Pat doing revelations 1 and 2?
[3:38:24] <%MayorRev> didn't RE6 have like a Left 4 Dead crossover?
[3:38:26] <%Validuntil2077> doesnt*
[3:38:27] <rytisone> someone who can punch boulders
[3:38:28] <rcand9> BILLY!
[3:38:29] <RunningNGunning> @MayorRev 5 is fun with a friend, 6 is trash fire that can be fun to laugh at with a friend
[3:38:31] <T_Sasquatch> @WackyXmand welcome to resident evil LUL
[3:38:34] <%valkuma> the iceborne issues are nonexistant for me

[3:38:36] <%FalseEyeD> D e n o v o
[3:38:44] <MattDemers> Yeah I went from 80 to 50% in town but I'm back up to 70% in zones.
[3:38:45] <%jillvxlentine> whatd we do
[3:38:48] <%valkuma> if you have a decent computer you wont have a problem on iceborne
[3:38:49] <%SvenHolgersson> Get yourself a puppers
[3:38:50] <%MayorRev> @runningngunning ahh okay
[3:38:52] <%SoFarFetched> capcom is getting their shit together......FOR RE3 REMAKE
[3:38:52] <GUNxSPECTRE> Pat has a big smelly but
[3:38:52] <%Ninestempest> is there an update out? I dont' see an option to download it yet
[3:38:53] <rcand9> billy is so strong guys
[3:38:54] <%mrcelab> @WackyXmand yeah i know. and im pretty sure lots of people dont even know what PE is. so its not even worth to do remake of that like RE series. thats sad imo.
[3:38:57] <natebud> I hope they put the Albanoid in Monster Hunter
[3:38:58] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Chichen Can we trade accounts? I want that username <3
[3:39:00] <%Ganerumo> Ganerumo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Is this the resident evil game nobody likes
[3:39:03] <%Chichen> @Ninestempest restart steam.
[3:39:05] <+Grayhammatter> oh no, it's a BANDERsnatch
[3:39:05] <+adventurerjess> adventurerjess subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:39:07] <%Wrashis> getting their shit together would involve turning off anticheat and we have to have anticheat
[3:39:08] <oyyzzo> space hangar
[3:39:08] <%FalseEyeD> Nice
[3:39:10] <munchkay> @taphexwin cool, but if you want to accept it that cool too
[3:39:13] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Chichen Amazing. Fantastic.
[3:39:14] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> Sure is worth waiting six months and then getting your save fucked for an extra 15 fps
[3:39:17] <Mishal21S> I like this game
[3:39:21] <%dirtygaijin> Only issue ive had with iceborne connection
[3:39:22] <%dukenux> Are those stretchy arms monsters the worst enemy in all RE?
[3:39:22] <%jillvxlentine> i dont think theres anything here
[3:39:23] <%connos_procrastination> please sirs dont bander my snatch
[3:39:24] <%Ninestempest> did it come out in the last like 3 hours lol?
[3:39:26] <%Mekhet09> Sounds like capcom at it's finest.
[3:39:26] <GUNxSPECTRE> Pat is bald and has a small pee-pee
[3:39:32] <+Dingalow> When will Fallout 76 have the same redemption arc that No Man's Sky had?
[3:39:33] <dj_arashi_rora> yo yo yo
[3:39:35] <+RestiveGaming> @Ganerumo I like this game more than re3... thank you very much
[3:39:37] <majima666> wait until he meets the moths later lol
[3:39:40] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Man MHW anti-cheat is such a joke I didn't even know it was real until PC Iceborne
[3:39:47] <%jillvxlentine> chris has to get those
[3:39:47] <%BurningLlama777> The biggest issue I've had with IceBorne is that I don't own Monster Hunter and so can't boot it.
[3:39:49] <zenith0111> Pc master race Kappa
[3:39:53] <nivlac_555> pc will always be shit tier for japanese games

[3:40:00] <GUNxSPECTRE> Pac Mustard Race
[3:40:00] <%BurningLlama777> But I hear good things.
[3:40:00] <rytisone> @Dingalow about the same time as Anthem
[3:40:01] <+TaphexWin> @munchkay fuck it, why not
[3:40:04] <%天使42199> @dingalow is todd howard capable of a redemption arc?
[3:40:06] <%Wrashis> i think the makers of no mans sky actually care about their ip,
[3:40:06] <Tucker0603> @AngriestPat all i gotta say about the iceborne's final boss is watch those eyes
[3:40:13] <+Dingalow> Fuck no lmao
[3:40:14] <%Wrashis> whereas bethesda doesnt
[3:40:14] <rcand9> how could you fuck up mh on pc so bad
[3:40:15] <%FalseEyeD> Life is like that
[3:40:17] <%jillvxlentine> THE MONITORRRRRRR
[3:40:17] <the_millenial_falcon> What system is this being played on?
[3:40:20] <%Valdorick> CAPCOM last year - "Wow, CAPCOM, you sure did do good!" "We did, didn't we?" CAPCOM this year - "CAPCOM why did you shit the bed on this!?" "NEW YEAR NEW ME!"
[3:40:24] <+Dingalow> I actually forgot Anthem even existed
[3:40:31] <natebud> Look at chat. It's like the Minecraft LP all over again.
[3:40:31] <+BringBackSempai> fuck yeah, Iceborne finally got patched
[3:40:31] <%dukenux> Everyone did
[3:40:32] <%necrocannibal2> why would they include anti-cheat in a game without PvP? who gives a fuck if someone cheats?
[3:40:39] <+Dingalow> fucking true
[3:40:43] <$MildConviction> what's Anthem?
[3:40:44] <%BurningLlama777> @Wrashis I appreciate that the No Man's Sky devs kept working on the game after the public figurehead dude lied his ass off.
[3:40:47] <$MildConviction> Kappa
[3:40:47] <%dukenux> Is Bioware even a thing still?
[3:40:49] <$joylent_blue> Capcom is such a rollercoaster of a company LUL
[3:40:53] <%jillvxlentine> F2
[3:41:00] <%Nikopol1717> Nikopol1717 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Hooray for more Bio-Evil
[3:41:00] <GUNxSPECTRE> PMR means nothing when they're getting fucked by parts manufacturers lol
[3:41:01] <%spiritofmojave> Capcom's like, IT'S MY BED, and I'll shit in it if I want!
[3:41:02] <%FirearmsInstructor> @joylent_blue Keen observation
[3:41:02] <%connos_procrastination> @necrocannibal2 apatBig agree
[3:41:02] <$WackyXmand> @mrcelab aside from 15 there really isn't a new modern day square rpg, would love more realistic setting but that's hard to do well
[3:41:03] <%Valdorick> The husk of Bioware is a thing.
[3:41:05] <+Dingalow> I get to be a smug ass because I knew from the start that that game was not worth getting hype for
[3:41:08] <natebud> Talk about anything, but CVX
[3:41:08] <%jillvxlentine> look at the monitor and you wont be
[3:41:09] <%dukenux> jesus it feels like someone erased them from public consciousness
[3:41:09] <+RestiveGaming> @angriestpat Do you remember the Infinite Ammo glitch in this? gave me plenty of fun back in the good ol days.
[3:41:10] <rcand9> i miss bioware they were a company
[3:41:11] <%BurningLlama777> No Man's Sky, more like Corp Man... Lied. Hue hue hue
[3:41:11] <zenith0111> @necrocannibal2 Just hack all the items you want when you're just HR 5
[3:41:23] <$WackyXmand> I hope Pat didn't get spoiled on the new raid boss, going in blind is so fun for new players
[3:41:24] <%jillvxlentine> YAY
[3:41:29] <Heyestus> o:
[3:41:30] <jorniev> man im feeling pretty chill right now watching pat play this game

[3:41:40] <%BurningLlama777> @jorniev Same
[3:41:47] <%dukenux> LUL
[3:41:50] <Heyestus> spooky
[3:41:50] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:41:51] <%Wrashis> i dont particularly like the game but its nice to see a game at least attempt to fix itself up and not just pushing microtransactions and pretending the glaring issues dont exist
[3:41:51] <+GeoMandrake> thats a good painting lol
[3:41:53] <%dirtygaijin> nothing special? are we looking at the same thing?
[3:41:53] <%necrocannibal2> LUL
[3:41:54] <natebud> It's a swashbuckling skeleton
[3:41:54] <%BurningLlama777> Yass Queen's Country

[3:42:04] <Clu_Flynn> these were the most annoying sounds EVER
[3:42:05] <bluescreen1988> paige bait
[3:42:05] <%天使42199> @burningllama777 the features were planned to be in the game but they couldn't get enough delay time for it, so the release ended up being fucked.
[3:42:07] <+Dingalow> Hey @BurningLlama777 you leave Shaun alone, he's a good boy
[3:42:08] <%connos_procrastination> i havent played riceborne becuase i played like 300 hours of the base game and sickened myself
[3:42:08] <rcand9> hes all bones
[3:42:10] <+Grayhammatter> thanks skelmo PogChamp
[3:42:12] <%Tearonex> dammit WHERE'S PAIGE!?
[3:42:15] <%dukenux> Skelmo's grand grandpa
[3:42:15] <+SpoonDawg> you don't need to remember it
[3:42:16] <Lionkevinson> Yay
[3:42:17] <+RestiveGaming> i have 1126 engrained in my brain due to this game
[3:42:24] <%SoFarFetched> @Tearonex she at a furry convention LUL
[3:42:25] <%Aydarkzero> AH
[3:42:26] <Lionkevinson> You did it
[3:42:26] <%connos_procrastination> cant even look at MHW now
[3:42:27] <zenith0111> I bet if the didn't have Anti-Cheat shit would be like GTA Online and people join lobbies just for modders to give them all the money and items they need.
[3:42:28] <%mrcelab> Yeah, where is Elmo?
[3:42:29] <Mishal21S> Progress PogChamp
[3:42:31] <oyyzzo> paige is above code veronica
[3:42:33] <codesounds> playing sci-fi evil?
[3:42:35] <%BurningLlama777> Shaun's a good boy, just like Molyneux. ;)
[3:42:35] <$WackyXmand> someones gotta send that pointing to Paige
[3:42:36] <%Aydarkzero> no tension at all
[3:42:38] <AfricanizedBees> It's the shitty flop they do.
[3:42:40] <+BringBackSempai> MHW patch is out!
[3:42:40] <natebud> If you though that was scary, wait until it happens like 8 more times.
[3:42:42] <$WackyXmand> painting*
[3:42:42] <%adventurerjess> apatPorgmo
[3:42:43] <AfricanizedBees> No weight, looks awful.
[3:42:45] <GUNxSPECTRE> Because you have more weapons than the Terminator
[3:42:47] <rcand9> just poorly placed to shit
[3:42:47] <KaliasTV> If only they had action music for every basic zombie fight
[3:42:48] <+TaphexWin> The only threatening thing is the rubber puncho melty men
[3:42:48] <+Grayhammatter> everybody do the flop
[3:42:50] <%dirtygaijin> no tension? but the music tho!
[3:42:51] <Zedimonx5> Holy fuck I just woke up from my accidental nap thanks to this game, I blame Suzi...
[3:42:55] <%dukenux> Cause you can just stab all of them dead no problem?
[3:42:57] <%BurningLlama777> You give that Goddess guy his money yet, Molyneux, you shit?
[3:42:58] <StonerStan101> @AngriestPat The zombies are just as tired of this shit as you are Pat. They want you to finish the game quickly.
[3:42:59] <+Dingalow> They're not really well-positioned, for the most part
[3:42:59] <majima666> maybe its the ULTRA MEGA KNIFE OF DOOM?
[3:43:01] <%jillvxlentine> you need the bio card dont forget
[3:43:03] <Lionkevinson> umeYay umeYay umeYay umeYay
[3:43:03] <%bluebiscuit94> are the zombie less threatning than the R£7 fungus people?
[3:43:08] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> I've got way more than 300 hours into MHW
[3:43:09] <+RestiveGaming> its fine they just replace everything with monsters at some point
[3:43:12] <%dukenux> How many people also took a nap?
[3:43:17] <+TaphexWin> Molded are coo
[3:43:18] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Zedimonx5 "accidental nap" LUL
[3:43:20] <%dukenux> *raises hand*
[3:43:21] <%connos_procrastination> moldy bois
[3:43:22] <%Aydarkzero> at leas the molded will attack you
[3:43:23] <%SoFarFetched> Im thinking of a nap
[3:43:25] <oyyzzo> this game totes r00lz
[3:43:25] <%FalseEyeD> RE Games get better on replay except this one
[3:43:28] <natebud> They're uninteresting, but they're an actual enemy
[3:43:29] <%AnIcedCoffee> the molded are just boring design wise
[3:43:33] <%dukenux> TBF i haven't slept well last night
[3:43:35] <rcand9> molded are agressive just easy to evade
[3:43:36] <Lionkevinson> The naked zombies in the cemetery were threatening
[3:43:36] <%SvenHolgersson> The mold enemies might be the worst enemy designs ever
[3:43:37] <%BurningLlama777> Pat do you have enough pistol rounds
[3:43:37] <+Dingalow> They're just kinda drag-and-dropped in corridors in this, so they're barely an obstacle
[3:43:40] <%Halowood> Halowood subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months, currently on a 32 month streak! <3
[3:43:41] <%Aydarkzero> Code Veronica more like Code Nap Time
[3:43:42] <%dirtygaijin> The zombies in this game act like they are part of the rendered background
[3:43:43] <%Pukenasty> yeah but you can despawn the molded by walking through doors
[3:43:43] <majima666> yeah, even the unlockable content in this game sucks
[3:43:43] <%CalderGaming> CalderGaming subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 5 months into to supporting an 8 year habit! All this Resident Eviling is making me reminisce about Onimusha 3 and Dawn of Dreams (yes yes I know)
[3:43:44] <%Validuntil2077> molded are threatening in a gameplay sense theyre just lame
[3:43:44] <GUNxSPECTRE> The molded also give you Black Lung
[3:43:47] <%Chichen> agreed.
[3:43:48] <%BurningLlama777> You might need to find more pistol bullets
[3:43:49] <GUNxSPECTRE> Ever had Black Lung?
[3:43:50] <%D3rrtyD4n> yeah
[3:43:52] <oyyzzo> welcome to the comfiest nightmare
[3:43:54] <%dukenux> so i decided to regenerate while pat replayed that lost save
[3:43:54] <+Dingalow> I agree
[3:43:56] <%dukenux> YES
[3:43:56] <rcand9> yup
[3:43:56] <%jillvxlentine> yeah i didnt like them
[3:43:57] <%Chichen> You see like ALL the enemy types by the end of the mansion.
[3:43:58] <majima666> no bonus costumes, a shitty first person mode
[3:44:00] <%jillvxlentine> they didnt scare me
[3:44:00] <%Aydarkzero> that is probably my only downside to re7
[3:44:02] <rcand9> still a good ass game
[3:44:03] <zenith0111> That and bugs :D
[3:44:03] <%Mr_Pylon> I like the molded if only because old men can punch them to death
[3:44:05] <%SvenHolgersson> I wish they turned into anything cool
[3:44:08] <Heyestus> the all-fours molded were spooky
[3:44:08] <munchkay> VoteYea
[3:44:09] <%vvitchguy> For the first bit the molded were amazing.
[3:44:10] <+BringBackSempai> hey there's the people-molded and the dog-molded
[3:44:11] <%connos_procrastination> i dont get why everyone thought RE7 was revolutionary its just RE in first person
[3:44:13] <GUNxSPECTRE> RE7 is okay because Zoe is a QT
[3:44:15] <+Dingalow> The Moulded were also weak to doors
[3:44:16] <%dukenux> Baker's were great, the base enemies felt like an afterthought
[3:44:17] <majima666> should have at least had claires re2 costume as a bonus costume
[3:44:19] <+BringBackSempai> and the boss-molded
[3:44:23] <%SvenHolgersson> it's like having Clayface but just have him be the monster person the whole time
[3:44:25] <natebud> Oh yeah the unlockable mode in this game is just a room randomizer with unlimited ammo. It sucks.
[3:44:26] <Lionkevinson> I love this game doe T_T
[3:44:27] <%FirearmsInstructor> VoteNay
[3:44:28] <+BringBackSempai> so much variety
[3:44:31] <%dirtygaijin> @Dingalow I think you mean Jack
[3:44:31] <djazo> that joker trailer for mk1 was so good
[3:44:32] <rcand9> bosses were great in 7
[3:44:33] <TheSegaDreamcast> @AngriestPat How would you rate CV's Tyrant?
[3:44:33] <zenith0111> @connos_procrastination Because RE5 and 6
[3:44:34] <GUNxSPECTRE> RE7 should've had weapons SKINS
[3:44:37] <%connos_procrastination> JOE BAKER DLC THO now thats a game
[3:44:38] <%Validuntil2077> shouldve done stalker jack and marguerite for longer
[3:44:46] <%天使42199> @connos_procrastination I think re7 was definitely a step in the right direction for the series... but re2 remake is much better imo
[3:44:46] <%jillvxlentine> okay so grab the painting and run
[3:44:51] <majima666> hes a good guy
[3:44:52] <+RestiveGaming> this game keeps coming back to me, this is the one where if you forget to store the fire extinguisher it fucks you later, right?
[3:44:54] <rcand9> really liked most of 7s bosses
[3:44:57] <natebud> He's trying his best
[3:44:59] <$sl8r4l8r> He is a noble and just tyrant
[3:45:07] <GUNxSPECTRE> Fuck Margurite, those fucking insects
[3:45:08] <+BringBackSempai> the car boss fight was the best
[3:45:10] <%Validuntil2077> his big dumb rock hands are kinda goofy
[3:45:11] <%connos_procrastination> @zenith0111 RE5 in co op is way better than RE7
[3:45:17] <munchkay> Hes just vibin
[3:45:19] <+TaphexWin> Here comes the big spoopy
[3:45:20] <djazo> his good but his the worst one
[3:45:29] <+Grayhammatter> i can't believe that guy is already dead

[3:45:38] <$sl8r4l8r> ALBANOYD
[3:45:38] <%Dementedpenguin> That looks goofy as hell.
[3:45:41] <Lionkevinson> When are you playing turok?
[3:45:41] <natebud> Aw shit it's the fucking albanoid
[3:45:41] <%D3rrtyD4n> so dumb

[3:45:42] <CrazyMedicine> Alien?!!
[3:45:43] <zenith0111> @connos_procrastination RE Xbox Co-op to be specific. Ps3 co-op was HOT GARBAGE

[3:45:45] <thatWaulfyguy> is that a tadpole with a butt for a face?
[3:45:47] <%SvenHolgersson> THEY'RE SO CUTEEEEEEEEE
[3:45:49] <rcand9> its a mmm monster
[3:45:49] <bluefooddye1> Fleshlight 2.0 has escaped!
[3:45:51] <%LaughingCatt> ohno
[3:45:51] <+RestiveGaming> lol the albanoid, the easiest boss in re history
[3:45:52] <+PanicSwytch> Is that a Pokemon?
[3:45:53] <natebud> You haven't even seen his final form.
[3:45:53] <%Maids4lyfe> IT'S SNOM
[3:45:54] <GUNxSPECTRE> Albas
[3:45:55] <+dheng1> The albonoid!!!
[3:45:57] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Why is he swimming on the floor what the hell
[3:45:58] <%BurningLlama777> Those looks like water types
[3:45:58] <Zooperton> SourPls
[3:45:58] <%Validuntil2077> a g-embryo
[3:46:01] <oyyzzo> alphanoidz
[3:46:02] <%vvitchguy> Cleanliness is next to godliness and your mother is pretty fucking close to meeting him right now - Jack Baker
[3:46:06] <ahaegotrigger> the night of the crawling fleshlights
[3:46:06] <+pectusumbra> oh end of the game countdown already?
[3:46:06] <rcand9> big scared
[3:46:07] <%templar010> oh shit Mr Saturn
[3:46:09] <GUNxSPECTRE> The only good thing about this game is Claire's vest
[3:46:09] <%BurningLlama777> Do you have Shock Rounds?
[3:46:11] <+Dingalow> @dirtygaijin I mean yeah, Jack is surprisingly weak to doors, despite being able to bust through walls lmao
[3:46:13] <Ipsenscastle> what is this circus music
[3:46:15] <%Maids4lyfe> they're water-electric types
[3:46:15] <munchkay> Spooky slug thing
[3:46:16] <$sl8r4l8r> Whew, that was a close one.
[3:46:17] <Alluringcrest> Another thing that makes most things not that threatening is the amount of health you have in this game. She's way more sturdy then in any other game.
[3:46:18] <rcand9> i think i shat my pants
[3:46:20] <%connos_procrastination> @zenith0111 i never knew that all my bois had 360s
[3:46:20] <$WackyXmand> do you think they could do more fun reveals in RE games like the weird shit that happens in RE7?
[3:46:23] <%spiritofmojave> AH SLUGS
[3:46:27] <+RestiveGaming> @gunxspectre alexander is pretty cool
[3:46:30] <%BurningLlama777> @Maids4lyfe Aww crap
[3:46:30] <tiaramaki> I forgot what happened if you kept the card and tried to unlock the shutter again
[3:46:34] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[3:46:36] <natebud> Albanoid round 1: a resounding win for Pat.
[3:46:44] <codesounds> wait I thought that part was a cutscene?
[3:46:49] <+TaphexWin> Those first RE games you run pretty fast
[3:46:54] <%FalseEyeD> Moving camera was a mistake
[3:46:55] <rcand9> jill books it
[3:47:01] <natebud> It's really noticeable when going from 3 to CVX, but this game feels a lot worse.
[3:47:02] <%Make_me_mad> I would describe nothing in RE7 as fun.
[3:47:09] <%AliceAstro> jill has had training
[3:47:12] <munchkay> We know pat
[3:47:12] <%connos_procrastination> do you think jill is barren from the T virus ?
[3:47:20] <GUNxSPECTRE> RE6 is gonna be a fucking treat. I relish in Pat's suffering
[3:47:23] <CassyASG> she gets slower the more hurt she gets
[3:47:24] <RunningNGunning> I think its the same speed, but the environments are so unnecessarily big and wide and open
[3:47:25] <oyyzzo> you need to find the golden hooves to go quick
[3:47:28] <+TaphexWin> Jill in Caution is faster then Claire in Fine
[3:47:28] <%dirtygaijin> oh no
[3:47:28] <%天使42199> @aliceastro claire outruns a fucking chain gun in this games intri
[3:47:29] <zenith0111> @connos_procrastination Dude ps3 co-op doesn't let Player 2 upgrade, earn money, buy new weapons or basically anything. Player 1 is carrying them the entire time.
[3:47:34] <%Validuntil2077> claire should just wear less clothes to be faster
[3:47:37] <+p3rcey> I hate re6 so much that it gives me heartburn
[3:47:37] <+BringBackSempai> the environments aren't as cramped as the alleys in 3
[3:47:43] <%D3rrtyD4n> i think id rather play re6 than this
[3:47:49] <+PanicSwytch> The music and sound effects are dull and lazy, the environment is bland, and Claire's running seems sluggish
[3:47:50] <jorniev> what is the scariest re game?
[3:47:50] <%FalseEyeD> @connos_procrastination No, more virile than ever
[3:47:51] <oyyzzo> mmm perspective
[3:47:56] <+TaphexWin> and the noises are from 2, not even 3
[3:47:58] <+BringBackSempai> big open rooms and hallways don't work for early RE
[3:48:00] <zenith0111> @connos_procrastination So if someone hates it odds are they played on ps3
[3:48:00] <%connos_procrastination> @zenith0111 god thats horrendous
[3:48:02] <%TheMattman1313> I think it's also that the environments are much bigger, but also blander cuz they're models and not pre-rendered.
[3:48:03] <$WackyXmand> i feel like this was the B team
[3:48:03] <%lethallunacyx> dude it's like half the speed of her own speed in re2
[3:48:09] <%dukenux> Kreygasm
[3:48:10] <Mexrage> i hope they remake code veronica, so it can actually be a good game
[3:48:12] <+p3rcey> skeltan
[3:48:13] <TheCrook92> skeletons wolskGasm
[3:48:14] <rcand9> i think claires hurt sound effect is re used from 2 too
[3:48:15] <%dukenux> that skell pose
[3:48:18] <zenith0111> @connos_procrastination RE5 co-op on Xbox was godlike
[3:48:21] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat The consistency is shit
[3:48:28] <oyyzzo> my skeleton can't be this suggestive
[3:48:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Bcuz muney Pat
[3:48:30] <+Grayhammatter> paige would be splooshing with that skeleton
[3:48:30] <TheSegaDreamcast> Jill's movement speed and dodge ability makes her feel like her S.T.A.R.S. training makes her way more of a threat than rookie cop and college student.
[3:48:31] <natebud> Hey look at those shotgun shells you can't get. Fuck you it's CVX
[3:48:32] <Mishal21S> They did for most of their games
[3:48:36] <Lionkevinson> Guys, Veronica is not that bad
[3:48:38] <MSN04_Sazabi> What's the point of remaking CV? Just make a new game lol, there's nothing to salvage here
[3:48:45] <%dirtygaijin> its about as consistent at the pacing of this game
[3:48:49] <$WackyXmand> Paige's fetish is effecting chat too much
[3:48:50] <%SvenHolgersson> Pat do my homework for me
[3:48:51] <%lethallunacyx> the game was clearly a bit rushed
[3:48:52] <+RestiveGaming> @natebud you get em wayyy later
[3:48:52] <%connos_procrastination> @FalseEyeD jill super T babies confirmed for RE8
[3:49:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DID WE THO?
[3:49:08] <%天使42199> @lionkevinson I really dont think it's that bad either but it is flawed imo
[3:49:09] <%lethallunacyx> or they just ran out of ideas or both
[3:49:16] <%connos_procrastination> Jills supercharged T virus ehhs
[3:49:19] <%spongeofmystery> What does that worm do anyway. I forget
[3:49:20] <+TaphexWin> BACK TRACK CITY, DUN NUH DUH DUN
[3:49:25] <%connos_procrastination> *eggs
[3:49:29] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> How much better would this game be if you could skip those door opening animations
[3:49:32] <Lionkevinson> @angel42199 I agree, I give this game a B
[3:49:38] <oyyzzo> and then lose another hour of progress? Kappa
[3:49:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Never stop
[3:49:55] <theaterunderground> im fighting mr x tyrant in re2 remake right now so life is pretty good

[3:50:03] <TheSegaDreamcast> Oh, I forgot to ask if you had an opinion on Morpheus Duval from Dead Aim.
[3:50:09] <Zedimonx5> What if RE8 takes place in the crater, formerly known as Raccoon City?
[3:50:12] <%jillvxlentine> but that happens in re2 as well?
[3:50:23] <+TaphexWin> It's basically a half assed zapping system
[3:50:23] <%FalseEyeD> YOU DID
[3:50:26] <%FalseEyeD> YOU DID PLAY IT
[3:50:28] <%mrcelab> What?
[3:50:30] <rytisone> You should
[3:50:30] <$WackyXmand> you also play as like three characters which also feels weird
[3:50:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Didn't even know Chris was in this game

They are specially useful in the battle against the Tyrant inside the plane. The gas is useless against Nosferatu, Alexia and Steve, as they are infected with a different virus.
[4:08:53] <%天使42199> @sporeian94 NO
[4:08:57] <$joylent_blue> sporeian94 yes :)
[4:08:57] <bestwaifuritsu> @AngriestPat Theres only one set of bow gas rounds in the game and they HALVE the health of what you hit
[4:08:58] <%peachy996> God even the alarm sucks in CVX

[4:09:37] <munchkay> @svenholgersson Dude or Girl version?
[4:09:37] <%BurningLlama777> I can't believe Alexia Ashford is in Smash
[4:09:44] <%FalseEyeD> Random planes flying in unison
[4:09:46] <%SvenHolgersson> @munchkay yes
[4:09:47] <%Deft_Thought> Man, Steve is so lame
[4:09:47] <%Aydarkzero> @Heyestus that's oddly specific...
[4:09:50] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Aydarkzero Pat's a dumb idiot who reset the game and lost an hour of progress. LUL
[4:09:52] <%passthehanky> @munchkay both dawg

[4:10:15] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Aydarkzero No I mean the SECOND time he did it
[4:10:18] <munchkay> @svenholgersson THAT'S THE RIGHT CHOISE
[4:10:18] <%goose_attack_almanac> How does Claire know how to pilot a submarine
[4:10:20] <%FalseEyeD> Time to BEAT THIS GAME, pat.
[4:10:23] <%goose_attack_almanac> Or Steve for that matter
[4:10:24] <rcand9> 1 stream game PogChamp
[4:10:26] <%connos_procrastination> Tyrant plane fight is terrible and i cant believe they did it again with Birkin crane fight in REmake 2
[4:10:26] <%Aydarkzero> @FirearmsInstructor NO FUCKING WAY
[4:10:26] <%juxtest> Steve is a submariner
[4:10:29] <%dirtygaijin> @Dingalow Came with the insurance
[4:10:37] <Zedimonx5> Just fucking blow it up early and end this already.....
[4:10:40] <%BurningLlama777> Sorry, I looked at chat for a second. Why do the rich people have a submarine?
[4:10:40] <$WackyXmand> the level design is needlessly complex for no reason
[4:10:41] <rytisone> Steve, wait

[4:11:05] <%Chichen> choese.
[4:11:12] <rytisone> first time I honestly thought this is the end
[4:11:14] <%mh9s> mh9s subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Two years of this? Christ.
[4:11:15] <%FalseEyeD> @connos_procrastination Sure, sure, but once you ace it you feel like a big hero boy / girl
[4:11:16] <%Aydarkzero> it always end in a bang
[4:11:17] <Zedimonx5> Choese
[4:11:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> We need a Choese emote

[4:11:28] <$joylent_blue> push Steve over the side
[4:11:28] <%lethallunacyx> at the time I thought oh it's just a short game I guess
[4:11:31] <%mistermastergreg> @BurningLlama777 you would also buy a submarine if you had 4 billion dollars
[4:11:34] <%Aydarkzero> yeah Steve!
[4:11:35] <majima666> itWORKED
[4:11:37] <%connos_procrastination> i remember playing it and being like WHEN WILL IT END

[4:11:46] <tiaramaki> "We did it! We save the... uh... US!"
[4:11:54] <%FalseEyeD> You are still in the crane fight, you never left
[4:11:56] <%dukenux> you needed to take a sumbarine to get to a plane
[4:11:58] <rcand9> imagine if steve survived PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[4:11:59] <%BurningLlama777> @mistermastergreg I'll take that bet! Lemme know when the $4 billion will come in.

[4:12:23] <%SvenHolgersson> Steve bout to get friendzoned
[4:12:24] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Isn't Steve like 15? How is he going to fly a plane or whatever?
[4:12:26] <+admiral_of_crunch> This is basically the end of the first disc of FFXII. As a kid it blew my goddamn mind that there was more game after that. I probably would've fell for this ending too.
[4:12:28] <ShichiNoBushi> It's as if the game is making sure I have inventory space for something.
[4:12:29] <$WackyXmand> man it that was actual Steve-O that would improve this game
[4:12:31] <munchkay> Are you sure Ste-ve-boy?
[4:12:34] <RDknight> wait Steve knows how to fly a plane?
[4:12:37] <%jillvxlentine> i think hes 17
[4:12:42] <%FirearmsInstructor> True LUL
[4:12:43] <%dukenux> @majima666 but here those areas are next ot each other

[4:12:56] <%bigdumbidiotguy> exploding in a plane > exploding not in a plane
[4:12:57] <%bluebiscuit94> One is certain death, the other is almost-certain death
[4:12:59] <%CalderGaming> that means fucking up the controls and crashing into a ballpark
[4:13:00] <%BurningLlama777> Is that an arapaima, from Animal Crossing?
[4:13:01] <+Rolandknight> Also airplane sim
[4:13:02] <%dukenux> this is a bad padding

[4:14:36] <+generalve> @AngriestPat you think this game deserves a remake treatment ?
[4:14:45] <%dukenux> Joseph Joestar almost killed himself and many others with a plane, many times
[4:14:47] <%jillvxlentine> you need to do it as chris

[4:15:31] <%BurningLlama777> Look how else do you add length to your game.
[4:15:37] <%dirtygaijin> I dont think there is as much backtracking in any other RE game
[4:15:38] <%FalseEyeD> I made a good living planting bombs for Umbrella in their facilities
[4:15:39] <%dylin456> does this game play with tank controles
[4:15:46] <+MajorCrasher> @angriestpat do they ever explain why Whesker has super powers in 5?
