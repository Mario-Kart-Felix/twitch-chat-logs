[0:10:54] <%YakumoYomi> Pat's essentially the |player test server"of Cinders.
[0:10:54] <%trllly> I dont need graphics mods, i just need mods that allow me to skip to where I left off in the game before. I hate restarting 60+ hour games that I was over halfway through. IVE SEEN ALL THIS SHIT, SHOW ME WHAT I HAVENT SEEN.
[0:10:57] <dipstere> This sounds like it changes so much you should finish your current run before updating Cinders
[0:10:57] <%heartlesshealer> elmo so comfy over there on the side
[0:11:00] <%patriotrenegade> THAT ASSHOLE
[0:11:04] <Gabbycat> YO

[0:11:18] <%DappercatEsquire> @trllly just keep waiting until it's all a faint memory
[0:11:23] <%Mendin> Pat you gotta go get the Crab Bait from Farron Swamp so you can summon EL CRABBO
[0:11:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> aw nertz its this guy

[0:11:43] <+TheBitingIrish> 100% fucking stupid
[0:11:45] <fuji_92> I agree
[0:11:47] <%mMayrro> it IS stupid fuck bungie
[0:11:50] <%trllly> @DappercatEsquire BUT IT ALL COMES BACK AS SOON AS I SEE THE FIRST PIXEL
[0:11:50] <iRobschach> How about this, all of Destiny is removed
[0:11:53] <%Mendin> There's three companions now: Solaire, CRABBO, and Rock Lizard
[0:11:54] <segbas2004> D2 is not a MMO, that's why.
[0:11:55] <%Clundy> Will it ever be time for crab?
[0:12:09] <%Aydarkzero> it's an "Action" MMO
[0:12:11] <%scrublord009> Quarantine Beard Pat Kreygasm
[0:12:12] <theanora1> you get EXP for heavensward stuff as well
[0:12:15] <%zestyArsenic> old content in FF14 is also still great
[0:12:15] <Scrub_Seeker> chester is by the first irythll bonfire, where you first walk in past the fog barrier that needs the small doll
[0:12:23] <%D00msDayDan> that's too much effort for small indie dev bungie
[0:12:23] <%spiritofmojave> i will admit getting The Vault in FF14 is butt over and over, but HW is fun in general
[0:12:23] <%dekkitout> Isnt the stuff they're purging, useless and repetitive?
[0:12:23] <%valriot> But its shit
[0:12:23] <WzillNJ> You also get tomestones that are used for all kinds of shit
[0:12:27] <%DappercatEsquire> @trllly drink heavily for a couple years
[0:12:28] <%SomeSageAdvice> and not to mention the gil you earn and the EXP you get
[0:12:29] <%valriot> Im at level 80

[0:12:41] <fuji_92> Bungee doesn't want to Isekai the word, but destiny is 1000% an mmo
[0:12:46] <+Dudealy> they're completely different games. comparing then is so dumb

[0:13:02] <LenDawsonsFresca> Kappa
[0:13:02] <%trllly> @DappercatEsquire alcohol is icky.
[0:13:03] <%dekkitout> So like back in Destiny 1?
[0:13:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> but if you're 30 levels under cap in heavansward dungeons wouldn't you be underlevelled for what dropped?
[0:13:04] <%valriot> Leviathan guns are bad though, theyre still static rolled
[0:13:05] <%heartlesshealer> Does Destiny finally have less content than at launch???
[0:13:08] <%trllly> Im in a pickle
[0:13:16] <+EonKain> @patstaresat thanks for shitting on FF13 in Clemps' podcast.
[0:13:17] <%DappercatEsquire> That's fair
[0:13:19] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt Borderlands 3 has live events that once gone lock out Legendary weapons until the event returns fuckin sucks
[0:13:20] <+TheBitingIrish> Imagine downsizing your game to cater to console players and their tiny harddrives
[0:13:21] <iRobschach> Bungie is too good to be burdened with Destiny this long
[0:13:22] <%SomeSageAdvice> it honestly feels lazy as shit and they're looking for ways to avoid creating new assets
[0:13:26] <%Aydarkzero> @PatStaresAt the Ikelos Shotgun is updated now though up until 1360 Light
[0:13:27] <%OmegaWeltall> Yes that‚Äôs why I stopped playing Destiny...

[0:25:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> they broke the cheese?
[0:25:14] <%YakumoYomi> So is it a net gain (more spells at less damage)?

[0:25:26] <%CalderGaming> all of you asking whether the cane will be used as a weapon: paige's back problems, which are why she needs the cane in the first place, would prevent her from swinging it

[0:25:31] <SomeOtherNeb> it was weaker but then Pat said they nerfed the spells to remove the nerf
[0:25:33] <%AncelDeLambert> cast speed is still a huge limiting factor
[0:25:34] <Citrus_Smiles> why play the game at this point
[0:25:34] <%DesertPenguin> That was still fast tho
[0:25:36] <%logoth_> Game plays itself at this point
[0:25:40] <Jontman42> and I thought the mod makers actually knew what they're doing
[0:25:40] <johnnycripple10> retired
[0:25:41] <%xeros720> hopefully they'll call it the, "god damnit pat, balance patch"
[0:25:46] <srkAres> "we nerfed damage by like 10% but also reduced casting cost by half :) "
[0:25:47] <+TheBitingIrish> @CalderGaming But what if she got TWO canes?
[0:25:49] <+TopTieramisu> game genie: the mod

[0:27:26] <Captain_Doomsday> This mod has Skelmo?
[0:27:27] <pineapplepervert> 1.76 nerfed ALL the spels, ahaha
[0:27:35] <%Greylander> On the other side, playing Deprived is rough at the start needing 6x more souls for level 1-10
[0:27:37] <TheArrow_> i don't understand the thought process behind the leveling changes
[0:27:44] <%kewlmyc> kewlmyc subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Another month, another sub to feed the mind goblins. Glad you know how not to starve now at least. Also invest in an instant pot and air fryer.
[0:27:47] <+TopTieramisu> the mod was already ezpz now it's infant mode
[0:27:47] <+TheBitingIrish> Cemetary of Ash?
[0:27:52] <%mMayrro> first bonfire in vanilla
[0:27:54] <FatherGreyBeard> Why is the leveling so much?
[0:27:56] <%heartlesshealer> Are they here or the other firelink?
[0:27:56] <%patriotrenegade> the graves?
[0:27:57] <%Binary_Fireball> spells kinda suck in ds3 anyways? or I'm just horrible with them
[0:27:57] <%Greylander> The grave warden is by the Cemetery of Ash bonfire
[0:28:03] <StaticSunrise> more like the cemetery of ass
[0:28:05] <%kewlmyc> How much grinding did you do?
[0:28:09] <+TheBitingIrish> Isn't that the vanilla starting area?
[0:28:11] <%Mendin> Pat, transpose the Moonlight Greatsword and check out its appearance when Magic or Holy infused
[0:28:16] <%PhantomMiG> PhantomMiG subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! I am finally done after 3 months of papers and exams I will be graduating with a Bachelors of Materials Science and Engineering. And will be going on to a Masters. Thanks for the entertainment while I did hours of data entry.
[0:28:22] <pineapplepervert> They suck in vanilla DS3. Now they suck in the mod as well :^)
[0:28:43] <%Starotter70> @PhantomMiG Eyy, congrats
[0:28:44] <%NopeBadguy> NopeBadguy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 6 month streak! Since I see you're getting more into card games, I'd recommend checking out Eternal! It was made by former pro Magic players and takes advantage of the digital card game medium to make a bunch of really cool mechanics.

[0:32:24] <%Greylander> fuck you phone, Heysel
[0:32:33] <pineapplepervert> Pat, maybe try to use Insanity Catalyst instead of cleric candlestick? It should have higher spell buff, and weapon art increases all spell/pyro/miracle damage to 30% temporarily.
[0:32:36] <%Agami23> nah. you can walk past him
[0:32:46] <SomeOtherNeb> rude
[0:32:47] <%Mendin> Gundyr's activation is an optional trigger

[0:33:37] <TheArrow_> that spell is a bit much
[0:33:37] <+TheBitingIrish> yuck
[0:33:40] <%Aydarkzero> even in a mod Champion Gundyr still gets bullied LUL
[0:33:41] <%Starotter70> How embarrassing
[0:33:42] <%Pookiedaexzile> What are we even watching here
[0:33:42] <%spiritofmojave> this is like playing with dev commands on
[0:33:42] <%Madbearv> -2
[0:33:42] <$Afterman_> ow
[0:33:46] <%patriotrenegade> Im mean, lorewise that makes sense
[0:33:46] <Rabicwill> just rude
[0:33:46] <+TopTieramisu> what an exciting challenge
[0:33:47] <%YakumoYomi> You also didn't fight him at SL 200+
[0:33:48] <Sunstalker> This is why magic sucks rooKek
[0:33:50] <%Conyst> stop he's already dead
[0:33:55] <%AncelDeLambert> the spell spam is a tad stupid
[0:33:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Guess not
[0:33:57] <pineapplepervert> Vawser is going to nerf Dark Dance to the ground now.
[0:34:01] <%xeros720> pat hates games
[0:34:04] <%Aydarkzero> 249 btw Kappa
[0:34:06] <%Clundy> He ate the poo poo
[0:34:09] <%xeros720> that's why he plays them wrong
[0:34:10] <DuoScratch> but...you ARE playing the game.
[0:34:14] <%Mrbaconator> lul people in chat hating on fun
[0:34:17] <%heartlesshealer> You still had to invest time playing to grind
[0:34:25] <$Afterman_> I feel like this mod is just a victory lap of DS3 for pat more than anything.
[0:34:27] <+tigerfang86> people hating because pat presses a button
[0:34:28] <sendart> he invested 30 minutes
[0:34:29] <pineapplepervert> >grinding offscreen
[0:34:29] <%Mendin> The funny thing is that even with this mod, Lightning Faith is still kinda fucked
[0:34:29] <+tigerfang86> lmao
[0:34:30] <%Greylander> To be fair this mod is kind of designed with several Ng+ cycles in mind
[0:34:38] <%xeros720> we're just joking, come on
[0:34:39] <+TheBitingIrish> And he never will!
[0:34:40] <%EySoyCoco> are awestones worth?
[0:34:41] <%Aydarkzero> yep it's intended for you to grind
[0:34:46] <+Lizard0TM> yo
[0:34:46] <Sunstalker> It's fun but it's so exploitable rooVV Chill out, chat
[0:34:48] <%heartlesshealer> okay yeah, that's cool
[0:34:58] <%Pookiedaexzile> So PAts literally playing it on baby shit mode and lying to us
[0:35:00] <%Pookiedaexzile> I see
[0:35:04] <TheArrow_> yeah i made a faith build using this mod and still had to only use physical spells
[0:35:04] <SomeOtherNeb> Barbara of the Deep
[0:35:12] <Jontman42> eh I'd rather Karla have the spells
[0:35:31] <%Greylander> Karla still does, that grave warden is just there to give access to the early game spells
[0:35:32] <arrempee> What kind of merchant stands at the edge of a cliff? That's just bad for business.
[0:35:37] <%Mendin> You get lightning spear to start, lightning arrow once you get Irina, then Brotherhood of Sun is still in Lothric, Great Thunder Spear is in mid-Irithyll, and their big spells are all mid-lategame boss transpositions including one from Gael
[0:35:43] <SomeOtherNeb> why
[0:35:51] <%bread_assassin> "Noooo Pat, you can't use magic and trivialize the game." "Ha ha, hexes go brrrrr"
[0:35:58] <%Greylander> Karla is now locked back in Irythyll Dungeon, so they needed an early game dark trainer
[0:35:59] <%DesertPenguin> three????
[0:36:03] <%Treuan> wurm
[0:36:13] <%AncelDeLambert> oh thry put him back

[0:36:16] <%Greylander> Three Solaires?!
[0:36:20] <%heartlesshealer> mmmm slow spells
[0:36:22] <%Mendin> Bless the Maker and his water. Bless his coming and going. May his passage cleanse the world.
[0:36:28] <+GenesisKnight> Just pelvic thrusting wurms to death
[0:36:39] <SomeOtherNeb> this seems like it's a little much

[0:38:42] <%YakumoYomi> Use hexes to hold the flesh together, like a Sith would.
[0:38:47] <%Greylander> Early game is kind of rough on a new character, especially melee
[0:38:50] <%Starotter70> Guys, hear me out
[0:38:56] <%patriotrenegade> oh, worm?
[0:38:59] <%Starotter70> Dark Souls, but it's an isekai

[0:39:27] <%patriotrenegade> "The way is shut..."
[0:39:31] <%Greylander> What about the destructible path from the middle of the lake?
[0:39:32] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Dark Souls is already an isekai
[0:39:32] <%Treuan> wurm
[0:39:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> Need climax
[0:39:46] <cosmicdischarge> Go watch Re:zero
[0:39:47] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt You can use the ballistas to kill the worms for you
[0:39:50] <%Greylander> Yeah, killing these worms as a melee character would SUUUUUCK
[0:39:58] <+chaggles> Is the teleport giant at the end of the lake still there?
[0:40:14] <+metalsiren31> To be fair, trying to fight these worms legit is just an exercise in frustration
[0:40:15] <%heartlesshealer> spell speed
[0:40:21] <%heartlesshealer> ???????
[0:40:22] <%Aydarkzero> slay the Worm!
[0:40:26] <%Greylander> I've been playing the playtest and it really feels balanced around ranged characters now.

[0:41:29] <SaltyAzteca> Poised through it?
[0:41:37] <Azathotic> @heartlesshealer I think the hitbox and collision on the worm is iffy because From didn't know how to put an enemy that large and odd shaped in to the game proper
[0:41:53] <SomeOtherNeb> ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä CRABS ARE GONE ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä

[0:42:11] <%Aydarkzero> monkaS
[0:42:13] <Lee_The_Limey> You should need to defeat threee ballista bois too since Pats getting trouble from them Kappa
[0:42:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Maybe three worms is a bit much
[0:42:19] <%heartlesshealer> @Azathotic Probably, now that you mention it. Thank you

[0:42:40] <SomeOtherNeb> @GaiaGreen everyone that blinked missed it
[0:42:42] <%Aniki_Tony> yea Gale but i's cool
[0:42:53] <%sniffy77> tfw a amazon order goes from arriving today to running late brownS
[0:43:00] <pineapplepervert> You can go to opposite direction from the worms, and warp directly to ballista.
[0:43:09] <+GaiaGreen> I'll have to catch it on the VOD then I was looking forward to seeing how that fight went with this build
[0:43:17] <pineapplepervert> So you don't have to kill them first if you don't want to.

[0:49:07] <+Soulbishop> I hate that hat so much.
[0:49:11] <pineapplepervert> It specifically says in changelog that all the mobs are buffed now, even basic hollows.
[0:49:13] <%DesertPenguin> So it's like Dark Souls 1
[0:49:20] <sendart> @patstaresat is your candle stick dark enchanted?

[0:50:16] <+Soulbishop> Missed an item
[0:50:22] <%TheShortSwede> Have Pat cleared the "normal" version of cinders and doing some extra content or is he doing something I don't remeber in DS3?
[0:50:23] <Scrub_Seeker> thats vanilla
[0:50:24] <%Aydarkzero> that's from Vanilla Pat
[0:50:25] <%patriotrenegade> always been there
[0:50:26] <%mMayrro> wasn't it always there?
[0:50:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> Is the shotgun hex in this?
[0:50:31] <%Mendin> Was there in vanilla
[0:50:34] <%heartlesshealer> Was there a thing in the room???
[0:50:34] <%YakumoYomi> It doesn't help that he doesn't use a lot of AOE spells. Mournful Flames was my go-to spell for groups in my playthrough.
[0:50:37] <%heartlesshealer> bye item
[0:50:40] <%Mendin> Dark Bead is in yes
[0:50:40] <blackbaron98> Always been there

[0:50:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Greylander I managed it fairly easily on 1.75 at least
[0:50:47] <%DesertPenguin> That was always tehre
[0:50:52] <%Aydarkzero> but yes it is a nice Bonfire
[0:50:53] <%Greylander> Dark Bead is in this, it's an Aldrich Faithful covenant reward
[0:50:55] <+Soulbishop> Is that coffee
[0:51:00] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Hey y'all, what'd I miss?

[0:51:17] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> more spammable/using than great sould dregs i think
[0:51:24] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Oh neat, Pat's rocking the fancy armor
[0:51:35] <%heartlesshealer> robes of those healer guys do regen, neat
[0:51:40] <%weissguard> BAM
[0:51:43] <%Mendin> You can -start- with the Prayer Set as a priest and it makes early game durability a joke
[0:51:44] <%Aydarkzero> poise LUL
[0:51:49] <%mMayrro> add curse of fortitude?
[0:51:58] <+not_draven> just in i miss anything?
[0:52:03] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> "build"
[0:52:13] <%Greylander> Rocky is part of your build
[0:52:18] <%heartlesshealer> Pat reallocated stats, fought three giant worms, and that's kinda it so far
[0:52:20] <%Greylander> Technically he's a spell!
[0:52:20] <%Mrbaconator> Rocky is THE SHIT
[0:52:23] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt Apparently theres a ring in the game called "The Elden Ring"
[0:52:24] <%Agami23> @not_draven pat started the stream at level 177 with 1mil souls
[0:52:24] <%linSP> stack every curse and champions covenant for fun
[0:52:33] <%Silverstreakhg> Silverstreakhg subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Did you happen see the video of a cop crying during a press brief saying to "stop treating them like thugs"? They really do lack any self awareness.
[0:52:39] <%Gallhint> pup snuggers
[0:52:47] <%Gallhint> oh nooo i meant snuffers
[0:52:50] <dinnydanny777> Wow
[0:52:53] <dinnydanny777> Read
[0:52:57] <BliVru> @patstaresat hey Pat do you think Fromsoft makes better knights or samurais?
[0:53:07] <%Pookiedaexzile> How hype are the politics of Elden ring gonna be
[0:53:07] <%JaydenSai> Hey if that P4G Steam stuff is real, are people gonna mod in the unused Yousuke Romance? @PatStaresAt
[0:53:30] <%YakumoYomi> They don't.
[0:53:30] <%heartlesshealer> the moment qualified immunity became a thing, they were never anything -but- thugs
[0:53:31] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> you mean dargons
[0:53:31] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> why the candlestick and not say, the aldritch staff for ex.
[0:53:35] <dinnydanny777> Midir probably loves it
[0:53:37] <%Gallhint> ymir probably likes dark
[0:53:39] <SomeOtherNeb> the show?
[0:53:40] <%patriotrenegade> Well youre fighting serpents so probably not well
[0:53:45] <%PlagueOfGripes> that hat keeps getting more ragged

[0:53:59] <%Starotter70> We can finally suck dick!
[0:54:01] <%heartlesshealer> that would be a nice thing to re-add
[0:54:01] <%Aniki_Tony> Big Hat Pat
[0:54:03] <JaseHateRadio> your hat looks dumb
[0:54:03] <Azathotic> Depends on how hard it is to mod the PC version
[0:54:05] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Brojobs? Brojobs. Kreygasm
[0:54:09] <%Mendin> Old Wolf of Farron bonfire, down the ladder, hang a left , go past the ramp, and straight on till the wall = Crab Bait
[0:54:09] <Azathotic> Not every game is easily moddable
[0:54:28] <%Mrbaconator> it's rockys family
[0:54:30] <%mMayrro> god I hate these things
[0:54:36] <%spiritofmojave> Think P4G is more likely to become a PS4 exclusive considering the Vita hell it's in rn
[0:54:41] <%Hegelundra> my ears are bleeding please use a different spell
[0:54:45] <%Aydarkzero> it's always the worst when they knock you off a cliff
[0:54:47] <%heartlesshealer> big shield
[0:54:49] <nivlac_555> Did you see that there's going to be denuvo on P4G?
[0:54:54] <%Mendin> Bass Boost the Dark Dance
[0:54:59] <%mMayrro> nice heavy armor there sucker LUL
[0:55:07] <%PlagueOfGripes> I can't help but feel perhaps the mod design may have trivialized aspects to the game
[0:55:10] <%heartlesshealer> LUL
[0:55:11] <ShichiNoBushi> It wasn't a rock. it was a rock... MONSTER! ROCK MONSTER!
[0:55:20] <%spiritofmojave> @plagueofgripes just a few LUL
[0:55:22] <KoyaMusa> it depends how much of the romance is still left in the game i imagine, we know it was cut but was it finished?

[0:57:44] <BliVru> Its really bad though
[0:57:44] <%AncelDeLambert> plunging isn't worth it anymore
[0:57:48] <@SoFarFetched> That's like me when I get up
[0:57:51] <SomeOtherNeb> the fight doesn't work great that way, the dragon's not meant to be fought like that and it shows
[0:57:54] <%Ner234> Don't die Paige monkaS
[0:57:58] <%Mrbaconator> the dragon was pretty easy with the dragon bone club
[0:57:59] <Psyramics> that just happens when you reach 30
[0:58:00] <%Pookiedaexzile> Wizards are constantly cumming, all the time
[0:58:02] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> But it's provocative

[0:59:02] <%DappercatEsquire> That's just good game design, plain and simple
[0:59:02] <BliVru> its really apparent it wasnt suposed to be a bossfight
[0:59:04] <%heartlesshealer> a message
[0:59:05] <%YakumoYomi> @SilverFaustX I guess it's confirmed now, since it's on Gematsu.
[0:59:06] <Rabicwill> It's just hilarious

[1:00:09] <%AncelDeLambert> after killing Ancient, yeah
[1:00:09] <%Mekhet09> Not hidden.
[1:00:11] <%YakumoYomi> It's supposed to teleport you after the dragon dies.
[1:00:11] <%Madbearv> yea you gotta go jump off the wall
[1:00:12] <%PlagueOfGripes> that's back inside in front of the statue
[1:00:12] <%Pookiedaexzile> @PlagueOfGripes But you wrote the riddle...you remembered the Dragon

[1:00:38] <wantedsafe471> man, dark dance seems a bit too good
[1:00:38] <%Fooguwu> Pat has become the Black Mage he hates so much. Turret man
[1:00:39] <%AncelDeLambert> @patstaresat they pulled the bonfire, use the elevator now
[1:00:43] <%PlagueOfGripes> the protection ring is down here

[1:01:08] <%mMayrro> ring of steel protection?
[1:01:11] <%heartlesshealer> hmm
[1:01:15] <BliVru> its now a shortcut up
[1:01:15] <%Mekhet09> Seems like casters got a buff compared to what they got in 3.
[1:01:16] <%AncelDeLambert> you still have to turn it on!
[1:01:25] <%Mekhet09> Man, they really made it hard to play magic in vanilla.
[1:01:31] <BliVru> its not open yet
[1:01:35] <%heartlesshealer> was elevator ever activated, Pat
[1:01:36] <Scrub_Seeker> no, you go through the arena, the entrance to the next part of archpeak is past there

[1:02:39] <wrinklemydinkle> RINGED KNIGHT GREATSWORDS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
[1:02:40] <%mMayrro> spamming neck swipe is real funny
[1:02:42] <%PlagueOfGripes> but also, FP shouldn't suck anyway
[1:02:44] <TheArrow_> its not equally busted but melee is strong
[1:02:45] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> people who say that haven't used ascended FUGS with high strength yet
[1:02:51] <wantedsafe471> Yeah, blessed hands of god is pretty good
[1:02:52] <%Greylander> The Fire infused Follower Torch is the most stupid busted thing ever

[1:03:21] <%Mrbaconator> @Daniel_Is_I funny enough the paleblood drake greatsword from this area has a really strong weapon skill
[1:03:24] <+LTKonnor> Farron Greatsword with unlimited FP is literally Johnny's Infinite Rotation
[1:03:26] <%Fooguwu> i know a guy
[1:03:28] <niishucks> When's BB gunand spells?
[1:03:28] <tusk102> BECOME. GIANT. CRAB
[1:03:29] <BliVru> you can farm them from Rock Lizards
[1:03:29] <Essixian> That's the big reason why I'm not sure I'd enjoy this mod, it just seems to remove most if not all challenge. Am I wrong in that assessment?
[1:03:30] <+LTKonnor> It just keeps going
[1:03:33] <%Mekhet09> You farm them.
[1:03:33] <%mMayrro> farm from dragon dudes
[1:03:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Mendin Crab people
[1:03:37] <tusk102> @LTKonnor lesson 5... SPEEN
[1:03:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's fun being able to Spin To Win with some of those weapon arts
[1:03:39] <%Mrbaconator> @PatStaresAt you can farm them off rockk monsters
[1:03:40] <%PlagueOfGripes> you open cheat engine and dupe them like everyone else
[1:03:41] <SomeOtherNeb> I'm sure you can in this mod
[1:03:41] <%heartlesshealer> Fight dudes
[1:03:42] <%Issun135> golden ritual spear weapon art is max busted
[1:03:44] <+Grayhammatter> dragon covenant PvP
[1:03:45] <%Gogogolem> Don't you have to equp the book?
[1:03:47] <%AncelDeLambert> buy them from covenants
[1:03:49] <BliVru> Rock Lizard drop
[1:03:52] <%Greylander> Early game is a bit of a challenge, but you snowball like Pat by endgame.
[1:03:53] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> but that's cheatign
[1:03:55] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> if you don't ascend your items, you're gonna have a bad time
[1:03:57] <%mMayrro> greirat might sell a few
[1:03:59] <%mMayrro> idk
[1:04:01] <%PlagueOfGripes> god damn these enemies are so fucking annoying
[1:04:08] <%Greylander> The real challenge is in the NG+ cycles and using the Curses
[1:04:11] <SomeOtherNeb> they're the worst
[1:04:12] <wrinklemydinkle> >level 251
[1:04:20] <%AncelDeLambert> which you then trade
[1:04:22] <%PlagueOfGripes> look at this nerd
[1:04:28] <%mMayrro> sick flip dude
[1:04:30] <TheArrow_> yeah pat's weapon is super saiyan reinforced
[1:04:32] <npsmh> pat you gonna stream the ps5 event in a couple days?
[1:04:32] <%Issun135> dragon scales can be forged at bonfires for souls after getting dragonchaser ashes
[1:04:33] <%PlagueOfGripes> doing dagger stingers
[1:04:34] <+Nahkc> SeemsGood
[1:04:36] <RetroDLC> ITEM
[1:04:36] <tusk102> wait what level is pat
[1:04:40] <%UW_Duncan> U get them from Dragon Deez.._
[1:04:43] <%Ranryu692> 253
[1:04:55] <%YakumoYomi> Trade in Dragon Eyes and buy Dragon Scales from the covenant?
[1:04:59] <%AncelDeLambert> npcs have WAY too much stamina and poise
[1:04:59] <tusk102> @Ranryu692 no wonder he's fucking decimating
[1:05:00] <%linSP> I hope the rings in ng+ are still broken good
[1:05:03] <Essixian> @Greylander That's not really a point in favor of the mod being challenging though, if you have to explicitly go out of your way to make it harder.
[1:05:08] <%heartlesshealer> bye ledge
[1:05:10] <%Mrbaconator> @PatStaresAt they can drrop from those rock lizards and also you can get them from trading lizard hide to pickle pee which drop from the snake men
[1:05:11] <%PlagueOfGripes> Did the mod add in anything like magical traps?
[1:05:13] <%mMayrro> you'll get a bunch of those just progressing through tbh
[1:05:21] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> wait are these just the lizard people from demon souls
[1:05:22] <%Ranryu692> @tusk102 he started off the stream by spending 1 million souls on levels
[1:05:27] <tusk102> wow
[1:05:30] <+shin_phil> nice hat nerd <3
[1:05:36] <%Mekhet09> Man, I love the idea of those magic swords but they have such shitty animation.
[1:05:36] <%AncelDeLambert> @plagueofgripes no, just turrets
[1:05:36] <Rabicwill> item
[1:05:44] <Essixian> Are there ladder mimics? PogChamp
[1:05:45] <PanicSwytch> item
[1:05:48] <%Fooguwu> i hear this mod added a Lola Bunny with HUGE TITS
[1:05:49] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> @PlagueOfGripes no, your gender is still binary
[1:05:50] <RetroDLC> Two items now
[1:06:00] <%heartlesshealer> bye items
[1:06:02] <PanicSwytch> item on both corpses
[1:06:03] <wantedsafe471> this mod is more about having fun with the various playstyles than being a brick wall to smack your head into
[1:06:06] <tusk102> that's why they have so many starter options @PatStaresAt
[1:06:14] <RetroDLC> You missed two body drops Pat
[1:06:14] <+Grayhammatter> a bit overkill there pat
[1:06:21] <+earthboy2k> someone take Dark Dance away from Pat
[1:06:21] <%patriotrenegade> I usually put limiters on myself for this stuff
[1:06:22] <%TaterBurglar> At this point, the sword is more of a ruse
[1:06:26] <dinnydanny777> Your spells literally make enemies go sploosh
[1:06:26] <+shin_phil> what is this dragon ball shit
[1:06:28] <Essixian> @EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries I reject the system of genders that Gwyn forced upon humanity
[1:06:29] <+shin_phil> i love it
[1:06:33] <%heartlesshealer> Pat is blinded by power
[1:06:36] <%mMayrro> on one side I'm all like "muh power creep" but also fuck yes im op :)
[1:06:38] <%Greylander> Time for the Lucky Ted build!
[1:06:41] <%PlagueOfGripes> now you can get the stupid calamity ring
[1:06:42] <RetroDLC> Three body drops now

[1:09:32] <baronvonbirman> !uptime
[1:09:33] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 9m.
[1:09:35] <%Gallhint> wait nvm tvs on im stooopid
[1:09:35] <%mMayrro> pat may kill pontiff in 30 secs but gravity will always kill him instantly :)
[1:09:42] <KoyaMusa> @Valentinius_Anodyne thanks, i'm assuming its cinders only?
[1:09:43] <+earthboy2k> its the second best currently
[1:09:49] <%Aydarkzero> Gravity is undefeated
[1:09:56] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> vanilla DS3 farming is woefully slow compared to what you can do in this mod
[1:10:16] <%Fooguwu> pretty sure the 3 gold winged knights have always been better
[1:10:17] <%Aydarkzero> you could just farm the dragon boss tbh
[1:10:18] <%mMayrro> isn't the best soul farm rapporting the angel dudes?
[1:10:31] <+earthboy2k> yes
[1:10:39] <%AncelDeLambert> there's no point to farming in Cinders, you build super fast now
[1:10:40] <%heartlesshealer> non-dlc farming I guess
[1:10:40] <%Gallhint> imagine running on rickety ass planks nuh uh no thank you sir
[1:10:40] <baronvonbirman> Did pat fuck up the dragon or was it an even fight?
[1:10:42] <cosmicdischarge> yeah
[1:10:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @KoyaMusa Indeed. Kinda like DS2, there are specific items for trading with the crows and what you get is selected from a pool randomly
[1:11:02] <%Issun135> Issun135 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! if you haven't found the golden ritual spear i recommend giving it a go.
[1:11:02] <%YakumoYomi> Miracle+Pyro catalyst
[1:11:07] <%Ner234> @baronvonbirman Completely destroyed it
[1:11:10] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt did u get the Ancient Dragon Halberd?
[1:11:11] <wantedsafe471> its a pyromancy flame that can cast miracles i think
[1:11:12] <+earthboy2k> cant wait to see Nameless King vs Dark Dance
[1:11:22] <KoyaMusa> oh i know what crows do but i was unaware what lizard hide did, thanks
[1:11:23] <%Gallhint> @baronvonbirman he held the dragons mouth open and injected dark into him viciiously
[1:11:24] <baronvonbirman> @Ner234 Sick dude
[1:11:25] <%AncelDeLambert> Nameless is a punk now
[1:11:45] <%Agami23> hey pat, thanks for the tip on the coffee with clemps about doing crystal tower and bahamut. really enjoying crystal tower as my first 24 man
[1:11:51] <baronvonbirman> @Gallhint I was hoping to hear that
[1:11:55] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt las time i played it was in the Ancient Wyvern arena
[1:11:55] <%AncelDeLambert> Angellic Barrage downs Nameless' wyvern in thirty seconds
[1:11:56] <%CalderGaming> THE LEVER PULL JUKE
[1:12:03] <%Mendin> Oh cool we finally get a miracle/pyromancy dual catalyst and it boosts lightning too
[1:12:22] <%Aydarkzero> in candlestick we trust
[1:12:25] <%YakumoYomi> Nah, Archdragon Peak enemies always fucked you up like that
[1:12:33] <Scrub_Seeker> well you're wearing the prisoner's chain and you have the covenant of champions equipped, so yeah enemies deal a lot of damage to *you*
[1:12:42] <%patriotrenegade> its one of the cut-weapons from the OG game @PatStaresAt
[1:12:45] <%AncelDeLambert> All spellcasters now have a good blade option that casts spells
[1:12:47] <%patriotrenegade> i think its neat
[1:12:48] <%Mendin> Not using the Insanity Catalyst yet Pat? You have the stats no-oh right upgrades
[1:12:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> not a chance
[1:13:04] <%AncelDeLambert> you actually did that bullshit gauntlet?
[1:13:08] <%Puhff> So did all these dragon bois die from meditating or whu?

[1:13:24] <+Grayhammatter> nice
[1:13:32] <Scrub_Seeker> time for the MIGHTY
[1:13:49] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> what the fuck, did they nerf gauis?
[1:13:51] <+Grayhammatter> used to give you the ring that makes you take double damage
[1:13:56] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> this new guy looks like a wimp
[1:13:56] <%walternatorz> this was not his intention
[1:13:57] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck this guy so much
[1:14:21] <%AncelDeLambert> also, yeah, bridge is open
[1:14:24] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> why did they nerf him so hard
[1:14:24] <SomeOtherNeb> the worst NPC fight still has yet to come, but it won't be for a while
[1:14:24] <+MeMillionthDollar> AI dont know what to do lol
[1:14:25] <%Greylander> Man, this guy got needed so hard
[1:14:32] <+dirtyh4rr1> Nice
[1:14:33] <+Grayhammatter> a slab PogChamp
[1:14:39] <%Fooguwu> @Puhff I'm not sure they actually are dead, I think they still bleed if hit iirc
[1:14:41] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> return the slab
[1:14:42] <%Greylander> He used to be a Yhorm fanboy with a greatshield
[1:14:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Rad
[1:14:46] <%Mendin> True Aurous Set
[1:14:50] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> Gaius was like top 3 hardest NPC enemies in the game

[1:15:24] <SomeOtherNeb> @TheArrow_ Sir Erectus?
[1:15:30] <SomeOtherNeb> the spear dick
[1:15:41] <TheArrow_> @someotherneb, ye
[1:15:43] <%Greylander> He's not called Erectus any more SirSad

[1:15:52] <gamesdonedrunk_> Thanks for the earlier stream so us UK people can join in! :)
[1:15:54] <%CJett92> THat was a helluva noise
[1:15:54] <%YakumoYomi> Deserved
[1:15:55] <SomeOtherNeb> fucking hated that dude, only beat him AFTER Soul of Cinder
[1:15:56] <%Mendin> Pat: "I can just walk straight there?" Dragonmen: "Gehehehehehehe"
[1:15:59] <%AncelDeLambert> bbbbbbbbitch
[1:16:05] <SomeOtherNeb> how's it feeeeel Pat
[1:16:28] <%Ranryu692> the button was still depressed when you ran over it

[1:16:34] <BliVru> @patstaresat the ledges in that hallway have items all the way back
[1:16:41] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> partok bivouac vs 100 scalie bois who win?
[1:16:49] <%CJett92> Relatable\
[1:16:51] <%AncelDeLambert> Erection is pure garbage, puerile, and stupidly hard
[1:16:57] <+TheBitingIrish> Admiral Bahroo's newest emote, rooOOOOM
[1:17:02] <SomeOtherNeb> weren't we all?
[1:17:05] <%MakotoPB> The button found its xanax
[1:17:11] <%CJett92> "Button was still depressed when I ran over it" ya same
[1:17:12] <Citrus_Smiles> climax is the way
[1:17:14] <+Grayhammatter> so, boulder heave
[1:17:15] <%AncelDeLambert> I cheesed him with toxic breath, because FUCK him
[1:17:36] <%linSP> the dragon fists I got here were my hexer‚Äôs primary weapon
[1:17:39] <%YakumoYomi> The Boulder is displeased that he has been nerfed
[1:17:44] <+TheBitingIrish> These NPCs are stupidly tanky, at least in vanilla
[1:17:52] <lionmanguy> !uptime
[1:17:52] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 18m.
[1:17:56] <%Mendin> Big explosive climax
[1:18:02] <SomeOtherNeb> @AncelDeLambert I spammed my R2 with my BIG SWORD and stunlocked him, he doesn't deserve better
[1:18:06] <SGrim> So you're saying it's good to climax? Kreygasm
[1:18:07] <%MakotoPB> insert orgasm joke here
[1:18:11] <%AncelDeLambert> there's an npc in the Dreg Heap who uses that spell, its complete bullshit
[1:18:21] <+TheBitingIrish> Don't pyromancies scale from the lowest of INT/FTH?
[1:18:29] <BaronWinston> Kreygasm
[1:18:29] <tusk102> climax always was as good you just wouldn't use it
[1:18:36] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> fp costs?
[1:18:42] <SGrim> Quick shot climaxes?
[1:18:44] <%mMayrro> was soul drag accelerating or was it just me?
[1:18:45] <%Mendin> Climax really drains ya after a few thoug
[1:18:46] <TheArrow_> @TheBitingIrish it scales on the average
[1:18:49] <+Soulbishop> I thought pyro didn't scale or it scaled poorly?
[1:18:51] <BliVru> there are items all the way back in the ledges
[1:18:59] <Zombrocom> Magic got nerfed a fair bit
[1:19:00] <BallerSwagBro9k> Just got here from Woolie HI GOBO MAN
[1:19:01] <+TheBitingIrish> So how's archery with the lockon nerf?
[1:19:03] <%AncelDeLambert> dark spells being fast is stupid, it breaks lore
[1:19:08] <dinnydanny777> Just shoot your dark gooey climax all over the enemiss
[1:19:15] <+alphonseisbest> a cheap climax LUL
[1:19:21] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt climax was always good you just refused to use it lol
[1:19:24] <+TheBitingIrish> @TheArrow_ Is it that way for all 3 games?
[1:19:40] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[1:19:43] <%mMayrro> man I love how npcs just spam weapon arts
[1:19:46] <%mMayrro> its hilarious
[1:19:51] <%AncelDeLambert> the npc SPAMS this spell, it's trash
[1:19:56] <+Soulbishop> Did we ever unlock the build for archery that actually worked in the unmodded game? Asking chat.
[1:20:06] <+Grayhammatter> how does it feel dragon cultist, to be a bitch?
[1:20:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> Th3SmartAlec subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Sharing this because it won't leave me alone
[1:20:16] <+TheBitingIrish> Wait, it only goes off of the flame level in 1
[1:20:18] <dan_g_v> yo, why is Pat wearing a Mexican sombrero?
[1:20:25] <dinnydanny777> I really hope one of those invaders is just immune to dark
[1:20:32] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> untargetable when downed....
[1:20:34] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> nice mechanic
[1:20:44] <%patriotrenegade> OLD MONK
[1:20:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dan_g_v Because he is dark dancing like its a fiesta
[1:20:51] <+Soulbishop> @TheBitingIrish thats maybe what I was thinking of. I knew there was a souls game where Pyro didn't scale
[1:20:52] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> probably just a bug though
[1:20:53] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, but its requirements are HUHE
[1:20:54] <%mMayrro> ouchie ouch
[1:20:54] <%YakumoYomi> I didn't think vanilla DS3 let you carry enough arrows for archery to be viable as your "main" damage
[1:20:59] <SilverFaustX> today the ps vita died
[1:21:08] <SomeOtherNeb> impossible, it means life
[1:21:13] <%Crimpson> @PatStaresAt Did you see that Persona 4 Golden was coming to PC?
[1:21:25] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> are there any aoe spells?
[1:21:29] <SilverFaustX> irony
[1:21:31] <tusk102> pat would use climax in earlier parts of the stream and see the number go down and immediately not use it despite it being really good and extremely fast
[1:21:39] <+BeezusHrist> Magic is OP from a distance LUL
[1:21:41] <+Soulbishop> In DS3 I think you can use pyros at soul level 1 as a deprived or whatever the name is.
[1:21:46] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> wait they added back in the giant smouldering lake worm?
[1:21:48] <%heartlesshealer> the vita still has one good exclusive, I'm sure. But it lost all the mainstream ones

[1:37:55] <%Binary_Fireball> you all remember that clip from the dude getting booted from survivor?
[1:37:55] <%Fooguwu> Snake summoners could always summon havel 2
[1:38:01] <ScreamLord> Cheeeeeeeeeeeeese
[1:38:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The flow of time is convoluted, and all that
[1:38:06] <%hax_metatron> Is Pat ... All for One? I mean this is what a shonen villain does right?

[1:38:46] <FutaSnek> Are the summons invincible?

[1:39:15] <Jontman42> @Zombrocom he farmed off screen and the recent patch broke the mod's leveling curve
[1:39:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Zombrocom He grinded roughly a million souls off-stream
[1:39:22] <%AncelDeLambert> the soul cost of levels was insanely reduced
[1:39:23] <SomeOtherNeb> you need to let him summon Ricard for the rapier
[1:39:25] <%mMayrro> San's fortress :)
[1:39:27] <+alphonseisbest> HOW LONG DID HE GRIND 4?

[1:39:58] <+ThePayphone> hes like me as a kid taking satisfaction in beating halo on easy difficulty lol

[2:02:57] <greynob> what does clarity do ?
[2:03:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Just enough

[2:05:44] <+Grayhammatter> oh, you get memories? huh
[2:05:45] <%heartlesshealer> actually cool
[2:05:46] <KoyaMusa> honestly great magic shield is a good spell that trivializes stability especially on great shields
[2:05:56] <$Afterman_> pls pat go easy on them
[2:06:00] <$Afterman_> they just want a fight club
[2:06:07] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Because your int is so high you might do more damage with the Moonlight Sword at this point. With 99 int it has 888 AR enchanted
[2:06:09] <BallerSwagBro9k> NO BULLI
[2:06:09] <%Mendin> Remember you have Deep Protection, and since it's ascended, its effects are doubled
[2:06:20] <Zombrocom> For what is basically just a shitty ripoff fanclub version of the real thing, the Abyss Watchers are pretty rad.
[2:06:24] <Kirbachev> Dark Dance looks pretty nice, I haven't tried that one yet.
[2:06:40] <%Daniel_Is_I> No deep protection LUL
[2:06:48] <$Afterman_> pat needs that DEEP protection
[2:06:54] <Tucker0603> @alphonseisbest indeed, PSO2 let me make my girl not only muscular but EXTRA THICC, I also have a problem with the fact that nearly all the FFXIV women are of similar body types

[2:08:15] <%GrumblePlays> what up y'all, just finished my third RE7 playthrough
[2:08:23] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt also magic shield on your big ass shield would be funny lol
[2:08:24] <%EtheralFlameX> deep and power within don't stack
[2:08:29] <%bevyrage> better than shield hero, because he doesn't need co-op to make progress
[2:08:35] <BliVru> @patstaresat the Moonlight greatsword changes model with a magic infusion
[2:08:43] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Good thing NPCs don't use Darkdrift
[2:08:55] <RetroDLC> Is Souls going to be a thing we'll all be thinking about daily until the day we die?
[2:08:56] <%Daniel_Is_I> Ascended duration is 60s
[2:08:58] <%Mendin> Also with a Holy infusion (and changes to be faith scaling) but
[2:08:58] <BallerSwagBro9k> You lack faith? Disturbing
[2:09:05] <%heartlesshealer> Ascended is a full minute
[2:09:21] <Robot_Nixon_> climax Kreygasm
[2:09:23] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt why so little into faith? aren't you a dark sorcerer?
[2:09:25] <%Daniel_Is_I> Also brass armor gives +spell duration right?
[2:09:43] <%heartlesshealer> Yeah, brass armor does spell duration I think
[2:09:45] <tusk102> then why not use normal spells?
[2:09:54] <BallerSwagBro9k> More like Unnamed Bitch now
[2:10:01] <%Daniel_Is_I> Not really though
[2:10:10] <%Greylander> Give Rocky a chance to shine on phase 2
[2:10:11] <%Gogogolem> more like Dank spells
[2:10:11] <Perky_EDF> Doesn't the int infusion make Dark spells only have 80% scaling now?

[2:11:13] <%CJett92> Pelvic thrust the king to death!!
[2:11:14] <Ultimatefool> Is this NG+?
[2:11:17] <dinnydanny777> Did you just block that
[2:11:18] <Rabicwill> that's the fastest I've ever seen that phase go
[2:11:19] <%Starotter70> ooooh
[2:11:24] <BallerSwagBro9k> WHAT
[2:11:24] <+demon_shadowplays> gg
[2:11:26] <Rabicwill> welp
[2:11:27] <dinnydanny777> Did you just block his strongest attack
[2:11:27] <%Lion_kun> what the fuck is that shield
[2:11:29] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Might as well just get the insanity catalyst at this point since you're not swinging at all, just casting
[2:11:34] <BallerSwagBro9k> WHAT IS THAT SHIELD
[2:11:36] <%mMayrro> EZ CLAP
[2:11:38] <%CJett92> t5he flex
[2:11:38] <greynob> LUL
[2:11:41] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt you have the slots to spare to use both spell types for dark resistant enemies
[2:11:41] <%albret__einstrong> It's not NG+, Pat just grinded until he could faceroll
[2:11:42] <%heartlesshealer> üëè

[2:11:48] <%asgard147> limesPoggers
[2:11:49] <TheArrow_> how exhilerating
[2:11:49] <Rabicwill> Nameless never stood a chance lol
[2:11:54] <Kirbachev> Is that the Immortal Dragon Greatshield he's using?
[2:11:56] <%Mendin> goodbye Gwynt
[2:11:56] <Zombrocom> At least midir will put up a fight
[2:11:56] <fuji_92> BIG NUMBERS
[2:11:58] <SGrim> Magic cheese Pog
[2:11:58] <%Greylander> Now let Rocky do it!
[2:11:59] <%mMayrro> now do it again with all curses
[2:11:59] <%linSP> SO COOL
[2:12:05] <%AncelDeLambert> the aoe miracle he has now is great
[2:12:05] <+demon_shadowplays> now fight oreinstin
[2:12:07] <%albret__einstrong> literally why even play once the game is this easy, I don't get it
[2:12:09] <%bevyrage> yes that shield is immortal dragon greatshield
[2:12:19] <sendart> o hey pat finally took off the big hat
[2:12:20] <Kirbachev> Yeah, that explains it. That thing is broken as fook.
[2:12:22] <%heartlesshealer> So Pat, brass armor set still plays with spell duration, right?
[2:12:22] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt why not take normal sorceries for dark resistant enemies?
[2:12:22] <fuji_92> now do it legit Kapps
[2:12:23] <+buffn99> The brass armor looks so good, definitely one of the best imo
[2:12:23] <+ConLin_Arts_> Fight him legit you coward!!!
[2:12:25] <fuji_92> Kappa
[2:12:28] <%Mendin> Warp to Old Wolf, go down the ladder, turn 90 degrees left, run past the ramp and straight towards the wall to get El Crabbo's summon item
[2:12:32] <%Daniel_Is_I> Pat is SL 255. Even with the run I did where I had like +70% soul absorption, I didn't get past 170
[2:12:36] <+alphonseisbest> @albret__einstrong its fun?
[2:12:39] <BliVru> @patstaresat I think Khorne hates you
[2:12:40] <californaya> It's called a power fantasy, it's nice to feel strong af sometimes
[2:12:41] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt if you infuse that shield with the magic infusion it might hit 100% magic block, making it block everything except dark
[2:12:41] <%mMayrro> it really doesn't LUL
[2:12:46] <%heartlesshealer> <3 CRAB <3
[2:12:51] <%Deft_Thought> That has to be one of my favorite armor sets in the Souls series
[2:12:53] <%Mendin> *90 degrees left with the ladder at your back
[2:12:57] <%Daniel_Is_I> Towards the white tree
[2:13:00] <%PlagueOfGripes> what happened to your horrid little hat
[2:13:01] <%Deft_Thought> That and the dude from the DSIII DLC
[2:13:11] <Jontman42> @Daniel_Is_I they also broke the leveling curve in the recent patch
[2:13:14] <Perky_EDF> Considering that spell scaling in Cinders doesn't have diminishing returns you can overlevel like crazy.
[2:13:14] <tusk102> i need more POWER
[2:13:21] <jj61794> Is the Cinders Mod to Dark Souls 3 what Daughters of Ash is to Dark Souls 1?
[2:13:23] <@SoFarFetched> Pat was out in fashion,but now he's IN Fashion
[2:13:29] <Scrub_Seeker> @jj61794 yes but also no
[2:13:33] <%heartlesshealer> climb into damage, thanks game
[2:13:37] <%Mendin> Nice sun eclipse happening
[2:13:41] <%PlagueOfGripes> nice of the developers to put all those slugs right there at the bottom of a ladder you must use
[2:13:42] <%Starotter70> Patsuke needs more power
[2:13:44] <Perky_EDF> Left
[2:13:44] <%bevyrage> you're looking at the ramp pat
[2:13:46] <sendart> you went to the right
[2:13:48] <%mMayrro> psa1guy
[2:13:53] <%heartlesshealer> distraction defeated
[2:13:53] <dinnydanny777> These enemies actually do negligible damage
[2:13:53] <%Mendin> Further past
[2:13:55] <@BigNaturalMan59> that eclipse is haunting
[2:14:10] <%bevyrage> ramp is also to your left
[2:14:10] <%Mendin> No you were going the correct direction
[2:14:11] <%Deft_Thought> What's the name of the priest dude in the Painted World DLC? He has that heavy dark armor set with the little cape
[2:14:12] <+FoolsArcade> thats not 90 degrees
[2:14:13] <%Mendin> One Guy is foiling me
[2:14:13] <%Daniel_Is_I> TOWARDS THE WHITE TREE PAT
[2:14:13] <%heartlesshealer> more thank 90
[2:14:16] <%bevyrage> ramp!
[2:14:17] <Scrub_Seeker> keep going along the wall

[2:14:24] <%GrumblePlays> so what does the cinders mod actually do
[2:14:26] <%albret__einstrong> your other left
[2:14:26] <tusk102> pat that wasn't 90 degrees
[2:14:29] <%heartlesshealer> 120 degrees
[2:14:33] <@SoFarFetched> Cinders mod changes A LOT of things
[2:14:38] <dinnydanny777> Crab battle

[2:14:54] <%CJett92> Hit the weak point for MASSIVE DAMAGE
[2:14:54] <dinnydanny777> Starboard
[2:14:56] <%PlagueOfGripes> crabs are cool, right

[2:15:31] <BliVru> The ultimate BIO WEAPON
[2:15:31] <%albret__einstrong> pat you moron he is dying of poison
[2:15:34] <%chambatron> You mess with the crabbo you get stabbo

[2:15:38] <%Mendin> Solaire, Rocky, and Crabbo
[2:15:41] <%Daniel_Is_I> Does Pat even have any buff spells right now?
[2:15:45] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt darkmoon set is bought from the covenant
[2:15:46] <%bevyrage> pretty sure it's at the top of the robes
[2:15:46] <%mMayrro> get it from yorshka I think
[2:15:47] <NiftyNox> Oh, Darkmoon might look better with the weapons you have on
[2:15:47] <+chaggles> dark moon covernant
[2:15:48] <+Grayhammatter> you mess with the crabbo, you get the stabbo
[2:15:53] <%heartlesshealer> I thought it was because he wanted longer buffs now that he got shield
[2:15:53] <dinnydanny777> The Drang set is so cool
[2:15:54] <BliVru> yorshka
[2:15:56] <+pectusumbra> wouldn't you get it from the darkmoon?
[2:15:58] <%Mendin> @Daniel_Is_I Power Within and the candletick buff
[2:15:59] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yoshka, yeah
[2:16:06] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt the Darkmoon COVENANT gives FP regen
[2:16:08] <%psychodave1234> psychodave1234 subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 41 months! who's excited for p4g on steam
[2:16:09] <%Daniel_Is_I> I thought it didn't affect candlestick
[2:16:11] <%AncelDeLambert> @patstaresat covenant purchase
[2:16:12] <%albret__einstrong> pat has the buff of being overleveled by about 100
[2:16:24] <%Mendin> idk
[2:16:28] <tusk102> I'm goin' down to dark moon gonna have myself a time @PatStaresAt
[2:16:28] <BliVru> she also sells the Moon light weapon that gives FP REGEN
[2:16:32] <Robot_Nixon_> CoolStoryBob
[2:16:33] <%Deft_Thought> It's the Vilheim set. That's my favorite one.
[2:16:35] <SomeOtherNeb> the GAME cheated
[2:16:36] <%Starotter70> Yeah?
[2:16:37] <%JD_Lars> Gematsu reports Persona 4 Golden confirmed for release on PC on the 13th
[2:16:37] <%linSP> more like dork moon
[2:16:38] <%Daniel_Is_I> As far as I know, spell buff duration only affects spells, not weapon arts.
[2:16:42] <cureneckbeard> GOTTA CHEAT
[2:16:44] <%CJett92> just a bit off screen, ya?
[2:16:46] <BallerSwagBro9k> LIES PAT
[2:16:48] <dinnydanny777> That looks cool
[2:16:53] <ActingKing42> @JD_Lars when's Us release of persona 5 scrambled?
[2:16:55] <BallerSwagBro9k> U BiG Cheat
[2:16:56] <Robot_Nixon_> You cheated not only the game, but yourself.. etc
[2:16:59] <%ikehildaman> Crazy talk! Activate!
[2:17:02] <%Daniel_Is_I> You have THE BIGGEST SHIELD
[2:17:05] <%Binary_Fireball> seems.... pointless
[2:17:06] <Delrugal_> new build? just got here
[2:17:07] <%heartlesshealer> 2% + 8% + 4%
[2:17:07] <%Daniel_Is_I> Armor stats don't matter
[2:17:20] <+pectusumbra> I mean they cost basically nothing right? No reason to not get them
[2:17:20] <%mMayrro> brass effect is pretty cool anyway
[2:17:25] <%FacetiousAF> hello chat
[2:17:25] <tusk102> @Daniel_Is_I i think they do in this mod
[2:17:25] <RetroDLC> Time to sleep, souls hard Pat
[2:17:30] <%mMayrro> with the ring its super dumb
[2:17:31] <%JD_Lars> @actingking42 They don‚Äôt mention anything about Scramble in the article
[2:17:38] <%heartlesshealer> probably
[2:17:39] <Robot_Nixon_> Can you get sunlight arrow early?
[2:17:40] <%linSP> darkmoon isn‚Äôt hexes, they‚Äôre int miracles right
[2:17:46] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt does the mod make armor stats matter again?
[2:17:49] <MartwyPies> Oh look, it's the NOT traitor
[2:17:52] <%FacetiousAF> brass much like the balls that pat keeps exposing on stream
[2:17:56] <%Mendin> Lightning Arrow is sold by Irina by default so yes
[2:18:02] <ActingKing42> @JD_Lars thank you, just asking
[2:18:02] <%heartlesshealer> Primordial shards now
[2:18:03] <eliamo101> yep poise is back
[2:18:06] <%Mendin> Sunlight Spear is not so much
[2:18:06] <roundmanhiggins> crabs are in games all the time, but can anyone remember a good lobster enemy?
[2:18:10] <Robot_Nixon_> lightning arrow, my b. Also thanks!
[2:18:11] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Because you can't use it with your faith
[2:18:12] <TheArrow_> i believe it scales luck as well
[2:18:12] <%mMayrro> its lower because you don't have the stats
[2:18:12] <Scrub_Seeker> you dont have the stats for it
[2:18:13] <sendart> needs 40 faith you dingus
[2:18:14] <%FacetiousAF> y'all what the fuck is that shield?
[2:18:16] <tusk102> it's because you don't have the faith requirement @PatStaresAt
[2:18:19] <%bevyrage> @FacetiousAF you know that the term 'brass balls' is a compliment right?
[2:18:28] <%heartlesshealer> stats will be soon
[2:18:30] <%EtheralFlameX> its only because you don't have the stats
[2:18:32] <+Grayhammatter> if you did, it would be more
[2:18:33] <%heartlesshealer> Pat just has to grind more
[2:18:34] <%FacetiousAF> @bevyrage indeed, i don't pay the man to be a cunt all the time
[2:18:36] <%EtheralFlameX> it maxes at 280
[2:18:39] <%bevyrage> fair
[2:18:56] <%linSP> I find your lack of faith disturbing
[2:18:57] <%Daniel_Is_I> Not... really lol
[2:19:03] <%mMayrro> man you could poke someone's eye out with that shield
[2:19:09] <MartwyPies> Any plans to check out that DS2 mod that makes it look super good?
[2:19:12] <%AncelDeLambert> shame the turret miracles SUCK ASS
[2:19:13] <%Daniel_Is_I> You're more just a straight up sword.
[2:19:44] <%heartlesshealer> he stumbled off the shield
[2:19:44] <Rabicwill> love the idea of a dark sorcerer whose fully decked out in brass armour lol
[2:19:45] <%mMayrro> yo FUCK these guys
[2:19:56] <tusk102> these guys suck but are also rad
[2:19:59] <%FacetiousAF> ah yes the endgame soul grind
[2:20:01] <%DappercatEsquire> Infinite ClimAXE
[2:20:02] <dinnydanny777> Your shield basically just parries
[2:20:03] <+nekodelic> that's a cool spell
[2:20:03] <%chambatron> Was that the cop that Paige tweeted
[2:20:08] <+FoolsArcade> illusury wall!
[2:20:08] <%mMayrro> no its not
[2:20:09] <%bevyrage> HIDDEN WALL PAT

[2:20:15] <Scrub_Seeker> no you missed an illusory wall
[2:20:16] <%Daniel_Is_I> Illusory wall
[2:20:18] <+IFlaske> CRAZY TALK
[2:20:19] <%PlagueOfGripes> are miracles any good in this mod? can you actually lightning spear people and feel good about it?
[2:20:19] <Zebroneath> Hidden Wall, maybe?
[2:20:21] <antyriku2> crazy talk
[2:20:22] <%Mendin> 1
[2:20:24] <tusk102> @chambatron the baymax cop?
[2:20:24] <greynob> Hidden wall
[2:20:26] <%AncelDeLambert> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:20:34] <+FoolsArcade> @PatStaresAt go back up to fatman location, illusury wall
[2:20:34] <%chambatron> The fat cop @tusk102
[2:20:35] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PlagueOfGripes Dunno about 1.76 but in 1.75 I killed Midir in 3 miracles
[2:20:38] <%bevyrage> @PatStaresAt hidden wall up where the knight drops from, and pretty sure it leads to an item
[2:20:41] <TheArrow_> miracles are still less good than other spells, but they're good
[2:20:42] <tusk102> @PlagueOfGripes to my knowledge yeah
[2:20:42] <Scrub_Seeker> @PlagueOfGripes yeah, there's also a new category of "holy" miracles that do physical damage
[2:20:43] <BallerSwagBro9k> @plagueofgripes yes
[2:20:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @PlagueOfGripes They're pretty good, in my playthrough
[2:20:48] <%AncelDeLambert> theres a shield there, but he dont care
[2:20:50] <%Mekhet09> Goddamn.
[2:20:57] <%chambatron> Pat hidden wall up the ladder you were in
[2:20:59] <%Mekhet09> pat needs to read chat.
[2:20:59] <+nekodelic> WALL
[2:21:00] <%PlagueOfGripes> didn't he miss something?
[2:21:04] <%bevyrage> he missed two things
[2:21:07] <%mMayrro> yes he missed the hidden wall
[2:21:09] <%Daniel_Is_I> Yes he missed an illusory wall
[2:21:11] <+Grayhammatter> he missed a wall
[2:21:16] <Jontman42> Pat missed all the things
[2:21:18] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt theres a hidden wall in the room where you fought the angel knight
[2:21:19] <theloganbrand> femdom queen
[2:21:20] <@SoFarFetched> Dominatrix Kreygasm
[2:21:22] <MartwyPies> The miracle nerf of DS2 is the worst most tragic event that has ever happaned
[2:21:24] <BliVru> @plagueofgripes I have a physycal miracle build that is great
[2:21:24] <%Crimpson> Oh shit what? You dominated it
[2:21:27] <FutaSnek> It's a quantum rule that pat will always miss shit
[2:21:28] <%AncelDeLambert> Angelic Barrage is good but only if the boss has a massive hitbox
[2:21:34] <%mMayrro> use siegbrau?
[2:21:40] <%mMayrro> nvm
[2:21:49] <%Daniel_Is_I> Miracles are honestly my favorite build in this mod. Blessed weapon + Sunlight Oath makes me hit for like 1.5k on straight sword swings
[2:21:52] <Robot_Nixon_> *heavy breathing*
[2:21:54] <%Mendin> rip Dominatrix Shannon, too pure god Godhand
[2:21:57] <%bevyrage> yeah if you can't use estus siegbrau should work
[2:21:59] <%PlagueOfGripes> never used the illusory wall to the rafters either
[2:22:04] <tusk102> @AncelDeLambert angelic barrage on midir Kreygasm
[2:22:11] <%chambatron> Up the ladder hidden wall
[2:22:14] <%PlagueOfGripes> fat man room
[2:22:14] <%bevyrage> psaBlind
[2:22:33] <FutaSnek> Can you just buy Siegbreu in this mod? I never wanted to use them in base cause you only get like 3
[2:22:36] <%chambatron> We did it reddit
[2:22:37] <%Daniel_Is_I> Dark miracles suck ass, unfortunately.
[2:22:39] <%FacetiousAF> pog
[2:22:40] <Perky_EDF> Pyromancies and Dark Pyromancies seem a tad underwhelming.
[2:22:43] <tusk102> psaBlind
[2:22:47] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> A winged knight
[2:22:48] <%AncelDeLambert> yes you can buy them
[2:22:49] <%FacetiousAF> that's a big angel knight
[2:22:53] <%mMayrro> your mom lol got em
[2:22:53] <NiftyNox> vineBlind

[2:36:34] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Lordran Remnants were kinda really bad so i'm glad they changed it
[2:36:39] <MartwyPies> so does this mod impact DLC?

[2:37:49] <%FacetiousAF> psaPorgmo chonks
[2:37:49] <FutaSnek> Ds2 Darkdrift? as opposed to the ds3 version
[2:37:50] <KoyaMusa> that this game hands out upgrade mats like candy really makes me with the vanilla game did so, that it takes a decent amount of time to really try out other weapons is annoying
[2:37:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, you can get 2
[2:37:52] <SomeOtherNeb> that is nu tek
[2:37:53] <FutaSnek> oh or that

[2:38:31] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Darkdrift is useful for the big tanky shield dudes
[2:38:37] <%mMayrro> might be because of that 10% reduced absorption one of your rings gives you

[2:39:52] <fuji_92> PYRAMID GIRL
[2:40:00] <BallerSwagBro9k> YUP
[2:40:03] <dinnydanny777> Imbues weapon?
[2:40:04] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> @PatStaresAt so pyramid head made it into dark souls before dbd?
[2:40:06] <Robot_Nixon_> is the whole executioner set in the mod?
[2:40:06] <BliVru> Wortless for bossfights though
[2:40:06] <+Grayhammatter> pyramid head
[2:40:10] <FutaSnek> Imagine if that changed your kick into a headbutt LUL
[2:40:11] <SomeOtherNeb> spells arent a weapon tho
[2:40:13] <%Daniel_Is_I> Probably doesn't
[2:40:13] <%heartlesshealer> weapon is weapon
[2:40:17] <MartwyPies> aesthetics >>> stats
[2:40:20] <%Daniel_Is_I> SUP TINY
[2:40:20] <%mMayrro> probably not since it says "inbues weapon"
[2:40:22] <fuji_92> weapon is weapon
[2:40:22] <tusk102> TINY
[2:40:24] <%heartlesshealer> not-weapon is not weapon
[2:40:27] <SomeOtherNeb> tiny
[2:40:30] <dinnydanny777> Impale with spear/big sword
[2:40:33] <SomeOtherNeb> it did
[2:40:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I love Tiny
[2:40:33] <%Daniel_Is_I> Time for BEST/WORST RING
[2:40:33] <+Grayhammatter> poor tiny
[2:40:34] <Zebroneath> He never had a chance.....
[2:40:35] <Robot_Nixon_> smol smough
[2:40:37] <tusk102> it just healed you @PatStaresAt
[2:40:37] <SomeOtherNeb> you got a TINY bit of health back
[2:40:41] <%Mendin> let El Crabbo fight t-aw
[2:40:45] <SomeOtherNeb> it took a while because it's an NPC
[2:40:49] <BliVru> @patstaresat this is the one!
[2:40:49] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt it does count for spells your hp went up
[2:41:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Also the ring's drain doesn't disappear when you take the ring off.
[2:41:04] <%heartlesshealer> neat
[2:41:12] <tusk102> it's just slower to function bc npc death animations @PatStaresAt
[2:41:19] <+demon_shadowplays> when's waifuu ciaran?
[2:41:32] <BallerSwagBro9k> PAT,BEAT HIMSELF
[2:41:37] <%Daniel_Is_I> Rejuv is stam
[2:41:38] <%heartlesshealer> probably get more health off of a percentile HP Regen item
[2:41:38] <koffeemancer> Restoration @PatStaresAt
[2:41:39] <yficaptions> is that the hat that makes funny noises down ladders
[2:41:42] <%mMayrro> restoration is hp
[2:41:51] <fuji_92> restoration is the one
[2:41:52] <tusk102> @yficaptions ye
[2:41:59] <dinnydanny777> Healing on block seems completely broken
[2:42:08] <%Daniel_Is_I> This build feels like it wants to be three different things at once
[2:42:10] <%mMayrro> I mean sanctus exists
[2:42:33] <tusk102> pat says hes a dark sorcerer then wears medium armor and a greatshield
[2:42:36] <dinnydanny777> Should rename this the Lifegem shield
[2:42:44] <+demon_shadowplays> i hope ciaran and artorias are a duo boss fight
[2:42:51] <%FacetiousAF> oh sick Blaphemous 2
[2:42:54] <MartwyPies> this is so overpowered
[2:43:05] <tusk102> @FacetiousAF ni c e
[2:43:16] <theloganbrand> Is this a DBD stream now?
[2:43:21] <SomeOtherNeb> didn't the first one just come out
[2:43:39] <@SoFarFetched> can't believe Pat's playing Bloodborne on PC
[2:43:43] <SomeOtherNeb> @PatStaresAt there's supposed to be a bonfire just before this in vanilla, right?
[2:43:46] <Robot_Nixon_> shortcut to armor fight?
[2:43:51] <tusk102> @SomeOtherNeb it's a joke about pats armor looking like the blasphemous armor
[2:43:52] <Zombrocom> It's a good shortcut for fighting dragonslayer , but the new bonfire from cinders kinda makes it pointless
[2:43:59] <%FacetiousAF> i do like me a big fuckoff shield
[2:44:00] <SomeOtherNeb> @tusk102 I'm a friggin moron
[2:44:03] <MartwyPies> this game so fucking fast compared to DS1 and 2
[2:44:07] <dinnydanny777> That shield barely heals
[2:44:28] <Jontman42> look at this cool hero
[2:44:28] <%Mendin> the bonewheel shield is in this game but called the Breaking Wheel so you're almost Logarius'
[2:44:29] <tusk102> the helmet looks rad actually @PatStaresAt
[2:44:30] <srkAres> "cool"ness
[2:44:32] <%DensityD> DO IT LIKE A COOL GUY
[2:44:33] <%FacetiousAF> find a ladder for the CLUNK CLUNK CLUNK CLUNK
[2:44:33] <%mMayrro> does it work with the sunlight book thing?
[2:44:46] <%Deft_Thought> Did the mod add any new weapon arts/expand on weapon arts at all? I know it made FP more usable because it recovers
[2:44:46] <+encrouched> If I was a backseater, this is what I wouldve pushed for
[2:44:46] <%maskofmichael> Has Pat become the new Pyramid Head?
[2:44:57] <tusk102> the helmet is great on this armor bc their colors match unlike the bloodborne executioners white armor @PatStaresAt
[2:44:58] <CrypticMochi> Now you need pointy boots
[2:45:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Deft_Thought It did, quite a bit
[2:45:17] <dinnydanny777> Pyramid Head wouldn't use a shield
[2:45:21] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> Why does Pats character look so dumb?
[2:45:22] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt drop down there
[2:45:27] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> I've been gone for so long
[2:45:29] <+Hamsh0t> what game is the shield from? demon souls?
[2:45:45] <+encrouched> fun fact: Pyramid Head also has a pyramid on his peepee
[2:45:51] <KoyaMusa> the shield is unused content from ds3
[2:45:53] <MartwyPies> Doctor_Death_Bed It's called fashion sweety, look it up
[2:46:01] <+Hamsh0t> oh radd

[2:47:21] <BallerSwagBro9k> YUP
[2:47:25] <Scrub_Seeker> @PatStaresAt key to the embedded's gimmik its that it has 0 stat requirements so you can use it as the accursed
[2:47:26] <MartwyPies> Remember that Kingdom Hearts 3 came out
[2:47:29] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt dark dance did barely more damage than climax just now

[2:47:43] <%Ner234> Yeah
[2:47:44] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt it's from demon souls
[2:47:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I think so?
[2:47:44] <%Mendin> I feel like Dark Dance in an enclosed area is... not
[2:47:44] <+Grayhammatter> oh what?
[2:47:45] <+demon_shadowplays> I wish there was a legit nuke spell that literally kills everything in sight and leaves the caster with like a pixel of health
[2:47:46] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> oh it's that sword from demons souls
[2:47:47] <%Hegelundra> yep
[2:47:47] <dinnydanny777> That sword looks sick
[2:47:47] <KoyaMusa> demon's souls, it was a sword that went through shields
[2:47:47] <%Mendin> The Paige Sword

[2:48:02] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> there is
[2:48:04] <%Mendin> It mentioned Vinland so presumably
[2:48:04] <%mMayrro> it didn't do the thing
[2:48:04] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> alot of sound going on
[2:48:10] <%Hegelundra> @PatStaresAt remember the demons souls loading screens? it's on there a lot
[2:48:12] <BliVru> thats a freaking Tenno weapon
[2:48:15] <dinnydanny777> Does the Keyblade have a special attack by the way
[2:48:17] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt thats selen vinlands sword
[2:48:27] <+Lorsula_> it attacks poise
[2:48:28] <FutaSnek> Demon souls had such anime designs for the weapons, I kinda liked it over the realistic look the series went on with
[2:48:29] <+Lorsula_> and stacks
[2:48:30] <%mMayrro> holy shit
[2:48:32] <+Hamsh0t> pat seems a little op

[2:49:41] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> you just have to drop off the ledge
[2:49:43] <BallerSwagBro9k> \[T]/
[2:49:58] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt go back towards the ladder
[2:49:59] <%bevyrage> go back up and drop off ledge to kill dragon

[2:50:45] <%mMayrro> psaUp
[2:50:46] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> why is game so loud tho?
[2:50:56] <+encrouched> That sword has seen alot of aborted kids in the Valley of Defilement
[2:50:57] <FutaSnek> YEA THERE WEIRD BULLSHIT
[2:50:58] <BallerSwagBro9k> CRAZY TALK
[2:50:58] <%mMayrro> fake drag-ons
[2:50:59] <+Hamsh0t> i thought the puss of man was made of dark, but got bodied by dark?
[2:51:00] <%Pookiedaexzile> Somebody fucked a dragon
[2:51:00] <Zebroneath> Humans are fucking gross
[2:51:06] <FutaSnek> Not actual durgons
[2:51:09] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt fake dragons maybe?
[2:51:14] <%Hegelundra> maybe they're like that ds2 man dragon?
[2:51:14] <+IMCthulhu> they could just be humans made into the image of dragons, kinda like the ancient dragon from das2?
[2:51:16] <dinnydanny777> More experiments in turning people into dragons like in DS2 ?
[2:51:17] <@SoFarFetched> Isn't that what people go to Bad Dragon for? Kappa
[2:51:19] <+bluedude153> Its fun that the entire pus of man plotline is completely dropped from minute 1
[2:51:20] <Jontman42> become dragon
[2:51:23] <%ChrisPlaysThing> neato, Matt released a game
[2:51:23] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt aldia dragons
[2:51:25] <%FacetiousAF> drakes?
[2:51:26] <%bevyrage> pus of man is more a parasite and the dragons were host
[2:51:32] <%mMayrro> oceiros' fuckboys
[2:51:34] <dinnydanny777> DS2 Ancient Dragon's
[2:51:36] <$lotharrio> Fuckboy dragons, you say?
[2:51:36] <+encrouched> Puss of Dragman
[2:51:36] <%Pookiedaexzile> What happened to his crazy damage
[2:51:40] <%maskofmichael> Dark Souls: Clone Saga
[2:51:42] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt aldia or ocieros?
[2:51:49] <%Fooguwu> made of HU-MONS
[2:51:51] <srkAres> hear that? the sound of no one being surprised
[2:51:51] <%DappercatEsquire> Don't worry about all that gross shit it's fiiiiine
[2:51:54] <zamzoph> forget what?
[2:51:54] <FutaSnek> @PatStaresAt I thought maybe it was dragon carcasses that where possessed by the puss
[2:51:59] <+Grayhammatter> DRAGON
[2:52:00] <+bluedude153> There is also like, a werewolf plague that they bring up twice and ignore
[2:52:03] <%Quigsies> DS3 is the one with the most wasted potential narratively
[2:52:19] <+encrouched> Give him some ANTI-DIE-OTICS
[2:52:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> is Puf of Man like, a primordial serpent
[2:52:20] <ilpeggiore_> this mod looks very easty
[2:52:23] <zamzoph> The Puss of Dragon-Man
[2:52:26] <%Mendin> You'd think that the Ringed City, being the source of the Dark Soul and The Curse and all that, would have addressed that but ehhhhhhhhhh
[2:52:28] <BliVru> @patstaresat would we ever get a Dark Souls game that doesnt feel unfinished?
[2:52:30] <ilpeggiore_> easy*
[2:52:30] <%gekizenbu> puff the magic dragon man
[2:52:31] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> I hear the twinkle
[2:52:32] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, DS3 narrative shortcomings make me sad
[2:52:39] <%DensityD> LUL
[2:52:39] <$Afterman_> patrick is a god
[2:52:40] <+bluedude153> The dudes with big crosses on their back are SUPPOSED to be the first signs of werewolfs but then nah forget about it
[2:52:41] <%mMayrro> pffft
[2:52:41] <srkAres> pffft
[2:52:41] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt the Blind sword was Selen Vinlands btw
[2:52:43] <%Fooguwu> puss of bussy
[2:52:45] <+encrouched> Go-overlevelled-od
[2:52:46] <@SoFarFetched> no no pat he said EASTY you know like opposite of Westy LUL
[2:52:47] <srkAres> he lied as easy as he breathed
[2:52:48] <%maskofmichael> Also you cheat
[2:52:49] <%ChrisPlaysThing> op build is op Kappa
[2:52:49] <+RaginVagrant> How far have numbers go up?
[2:52:49] <+demon_shadowplays> this mod is a joke! lol
[2:52:50] <FutaSnek> Between Not fighting a Pilgrim butterfly AT ALL and not enough lore on the puss of man, it feels like there's another story RIGHT under the surface of DS3
[2:52:59] <+demon_shadowplays> suoer easy
[2:53:04] <%NeoCre> PLAY FREEBIRD
[2:53:07] <BallerSwagBro9k> HA
[2:53:09] <%mMayrro> you can't spell good without "I grinded a little off-screen"
[2:53:10] <tusk102> YES
[2:53:11] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @RaginVagrant over 9000
[2:53:11] <%Pookiedaexzile> Ringed City Addressed everything. Like whose been eating all da abyss
[2:53:12] <jaytrident> someone should totally make a mod like this for the borderlands game.
[2:53:15] <%Hegelundra> YES
[2:53:17] <%asurite_warrior> there seems to be alot more items everywhere in this mod.
[2:53:18] <+Grayhammatter> sure, just get more faith
[2:53:20] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt YES
[2:53:21] <@SoFarFetched> I mean it probably looks easy with the build pat has
[2:53:21] <+encrouched> mo damage mor problems
[2:53:24] <%asurite_warrior> feels like a trail of candy
[2:53:29] <PanicSwytch> These are Pro Strats ppl
[2:53:29] <fuji_92> faith it up
[2:53:35] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt faith it up
[2:53:43] <%NeoCre> @asurite_warrior They added a ridiculous number of items
[2:53:43] <zamzoph> I was so sure that there was going to be a DLC about the Angels and Gwynevere
[2:54:01] <%Pookiedaexzile> There was
[2:54:05] <%mMayrro> I thought she only cared if you did her quest?
[2:54:07] <+demon_shadowplays> I love sirris! good lucastiel
[2:54:09] <FutaSnek> And Im gonna say its the biggest missed opportunity that the DAMN ABYSS never made a comeback, was the coolest zone in 1 IMO
[2:54:10] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt she'll only leave if you level up your rosaria covenant
[2:54:13] <%Mendin> Summon El Crabbo
[2:54:18] <MartwyPies> Pat's dark souls playthroughs are complete opposite of Lobos's
[2:54:22] <+bluedude153> LET EL CRABBO DEFEAT HIM
[2:54:27] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt SUMMON EL CRABBO
[2:54:30] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[2:54:32] <jdanov> wtf i miss one stream and suddenly Pat is cosplaying as Gold Patrick Star?
[2:54:32] <%Pilzkun> HERE'S PATTY
[2:54:34] <dinnydanny777> It's the guy from DS1 and DS2
[2:54:36] <+demon_shadowplays> where's solaire?
[2:54:44] <FutaSnek> El Crabbo is too powerfull he'll crash Pat's PC
[2:54:51] <%maenos2> @jdanov ok that made me crack up, well put
[2:54:52] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> kinda looks like sorcery and magic is the only way to play now
[2:55:01] <%Mitchellsocks> This is a relazing trip through the game at this point
[2:55:02] <%Aydarkzero> oh...
[2:55:04] <%mMayrro> look guys its poop rain
[2:55:15] <Irkallu> EZPZ
[2:55:17] <%Fooguwu> really needed help for this one huh
[2:55:20] <FutaSnek> MORE LIKE DRAGONSLAYER..... BITCH
[2:55:24] <FutaSnek> GOTTEM
[2:55:28] <+alphonseisbest> hows pyro in this mod?
[2:55:31] <zamzoph> this mod is easy modo
[2:55:32] <+IMCthulhu> nice
[2:55:35] <+neon_island> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:55:35] <%chambatron> This dude killed me like 50 times the first time
[2:55:40] <MayorRev> Flawless Victory!
[2:55:41] <ScreamLord> Hex is fucking busted
[2:55:42] <+Grayhammatter> easy modo
[2:55:43] <tusk102> hows it feel dragonslayer? to be a... bitch?
[2:55:44] <RetroCop87> PAT YOU ARE SO COOL
[2:55:44] <%Pookiedaexzile> DragonSlayerBitch is my new OC don't steal
[2:55:46] <%PaladinDupre> NO BONFIRE GO BACK
[2:55:48] <%ChrisPlaysThing> so magic might be too strong Kappa
[2:55:50] <%MrBorisMakarov> technically you did get hit hobbWeird Kappa
[2:55:52] <Kirbachev> @alphonseisbest Pretty much everything is broken as fuck eventually, but the start is a good bit rougher.
[2:55:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> Is pat playing the executioner in DBD?
[2:55:55] <MartwyPies> The biggest number
[2:55:58] <dinnydanny777> Huh so shield and magic is how to beat the game no damage huh
[2:56:02] <tusk102> @ScreamLord he's not really a hexer, he just has 99 intelligence
[2:56:02] <FutaSnek> It may just be me but I fucking hate the grand archives
[2:56:04] <%Mitchellsocks> Dragonslayer Bitch is a girthy gold himbo
[2:56:04] <%Gallhint> i wouldnt say cinders is ez mode so much as it is FUN MODE
[2:56:12] <%albret__einstrong> turns out with 250 levels of spell scaling and the best shield any any DS game the game is easy
[2:56:16] <Freezern> Blocking is a hit if you follow HappyHob rules for no-hit Kappa
[2:56:18] <+alphonseisbest> @Kirbachev gtk thx
[2:56:29] <%Fooguwu> i've never gone down there....
[2:56:30] <Kirbachev> @Gallhint Good way of putting it. It can still give you a hard time, but goddamn is it entertaining.
[2:56:31] <%mMayrro> imagine having fun with video games LUL
[2:56:37] <cureneckbeard> fun but also easy
[2:56:38] <+bluedude153> LET CRABBO FIGHT BOSSES
[2:56:43] <FutaSnek> It seems like it could either be drastically easier/harder then base depending on your buikld
[2:56:47] <srkAres> i heard people play souls games because they hate fun MiniK
[2:56:52] <%Mendin> What's that DMC(?) difficulty where both you, and the enemies, all do Big Damage
[2:56:52] <+chaggles> sequence brake
[2:56:54] <%FacetiousAF> @bluedude153 idk man you mess with the crabbo you get the stabbo
[2:56:55] <+demon_shadowplays> is manus a pokemon in this game?
[2:56:59] <+chaggles> its always there now
[2:57:00] <Skeletonmanners> @PatStaresAt if you have Curse of Attraction on you need to fight Vordt on the way to archives
[2:57:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> What do you mean Dark Souls isn't digital CBT? >:(
[2:57:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> @srkAres Its true we do hate fun
[2:57:05] <+nekodelic> @mendin heaven or hell
[2:57:05] <fuji_92> imagine having fun on ds
[2:57:06] <tusk102> @Mendin heaven and hell
[2:57:10] <BallerSwagBro9k> It can be easier or harder your choice
[2:57:11] <%NeoCre> I‚Äôd agree with that. Balance has been thrown to the win for funsies
[2:57:12] <FutaSnek> Extra Insanity monkaS
[2:57:23] <+DoctorThrax> What helmet is that?
[2:57:25] <%Mendin> There we go. Cinders is Heaven and Hell mode
[2:57:27] <KoyaMusa> god i miss doing things at a bonfire
[2:57:29] <%NeoCre> Though that also applies to the bois you fight too
[2:57:32] <ipodstroker_> there's an item on the roof
[2:57:36] <Kirbachev> The Trials mode pretty much highlights the "fun first" mentality of this mod.
[2:57:56] <tusk102> @Mendin heaven and hell is you and enemies die in one hit. the other one is hell and hell in which enemies have the health from the hardest difficulty but you die in one hit
[2:57:57] <NiftyNox> Wouldnt want to be underleveled now would we Kappa
[2:57:57] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> omg how did you farm?
[2:57:58] <+RaginVagrant> DAMN THEM NUMBERS GO UP!
[2:58:05] <tusk102> @Mendin if i remember correctly
[2:58:09] <%mMayrro> hypermode PogChamp
[2:58:16] <FutaSnek> And I mean shit I rather mods go all out changing stuff rather then just subtle little tweaks here and there
[2:58:21] <FutaSnek> YOOOO
[2:58:23] <fuji_92> RAKUYO
[2:58:24] <+Grayhammatter> oh wow
[2:58:25] <NiftyNox> LADY MATIA
[2:58:25] <%FacetiousAF> nice
[2:58:27] <NiftyNox> MARIA
[2:58:35] <%asgard147> MARIA
[2:58:35] <dinnydanny777> It uses a lot of stamina
[2:58:36] <%PaladinDupre> try the weapon art
[2:58:44] <tusk102> try weapon art @PatStaresAt
[2:58:47] <tusk102> oh rip
[2:58:49] <%PaladinDupre> ooh lame
[2:58:49] <%mMayrro> LADY MARIAH CAREY???
[2:58:49] <%Mitchellsocks> Can you two hand for something different?
[2:58:58] <tusk102> WHAT
[2:58:58] <Mawarup> I re-downloaded Bloodborne after playing Cinders for a while and oof I forgot how often you needed to go back to the Hunters dream
[2:58:59] <+Grayhammatter> wait... what?
[2:59:05] <+chaggles> check the effect
[2:59:10] <Kirbachev> I tabbed out for a sec, what'd I miss
[2:59:11] <tusk102> straight to twin princes???? @PatStaresAt
[2:59:11] <%mMayrro> it doesn't move tho
[2:59:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> I long for Bloodborne on PC
[2:59:26] <%Mitchellsocks> For being my second favorite game of all time, Bloodborne has a ton of quality of life issues
[2:59:27] <SomeOtherNeb> don't we all
[2:59:31] <NiftyNox> yooo caitha
[2:59:34] <Kirbachev> What's a big difference?
[2:59:50] <KoyaMusa> biggest thing i'd want out of a bloodborne mod is for lanterns to function as bonfires
[2:59:50] <%PaladinDupre> (its not)
[2:59:56] <%mMayrro> it isnt lol
[2:59:57] <Jontman42> nope
[2:59:59] <%mMayrro> Jebaited
[2:59:59] <tusk102> @Mawarup the fact that you need to go back fucking constantly is easily my biggest gripe with the game
[3:00:02] <fuji_92> nah
[3:00:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> LUL Did you not check?
[3:00:06] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> did pat cheat or did I not find any of the good stuff?
[3:00:06] <+RaginVagrant> sick burn
[3:00:19] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> partick bivouac bamboozled
[3:00:19] <%heartlesshealer> Pat grinded offscreen
[3:00:22] <tusk102> @Cory_the_Dinosaur he grinded 1 million souls off screen
[3:00:28] <%mMayrro> activate the curses coward
[3:00:29] <%Mitchellsocks> Lanterns should be bonfires, blood vials should estus, or AT LEAST scale with health, framerate is... very suboptimal
[3:00:31] <FutaSnek> Big dick mode you mean?
[3:00:33] <Freezern> @Cory_the_Dinosaur Streamer luck is a real buff
[3:00:34] <Kirbachev> @heartlesshealer Deja vu LUL
[3:00:35] <%heartlesshealer> during current broken exp/souls version
[3:00:35] <fuji_92> "harder"
[3:00:36] <+nekodelic> Bloodborne would be great if it didn't have stamina
[3:00:39] <CurrySauseBandit> So without the 30% they'd be getting 2 shot
[3:00:43] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt use the boss health regen curse, coward
[3:00:44] <CurrySauseBandit> Neat
[3:01:04] <%heartlesshealer> @Kirbachev Yup =p
[3:01:07] <Kirbachev> Oh fuck, dem soul spears
[3:01:10] <%Mendin> So the Grand Archives Key spawns even if you havent beaten the other three Lords of Ciinder
[3:01:11] <SomeOtherNeb> I managed to kill that fucking sage right away on my run and I was SO HAPPY
[3:01:13] <%Mitchellsocks> Bloodborne stamina is easily the easiest stamina to manage in the series
[3:01:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> WELCOME TO MAGIC SCHOOL

[3:01:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I think you can get a Physical Miracle that acts like a Soul Spear from the Princes
[3:01:46] <tusk102> @dinnydanny777 he drops the crystal scroll
[3:01:47] <Mawarup> oh yeah I am hating the fact that I have to farm blood vials and bullets
[3:01:51] <%Mendin> Yes but they're a miniboss that teleports at HP thresholds around the place to be a persistent bitch
[3:01:54] <Kirbachev> @FutaSnek LeviousAAAAAaaaaaaahhhh~
[3:02:04] <%l3sovikk> A shield? In Dark Souls?
[3:02:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Kirbachev RON STAWWWWPPPP
[3:02:32] <%PaladinDupre> @PatStaresAt that hat is cool but the heal it gives really isnt enough to make up for less effect duration
[3:02:33] <%theluckyhero> theluckyhero subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hey, Pat hope things are going well in these times of staying indoors. Have fun with the big dark souls playtime
[3:02:36] <Kirbachev> @doc_ock_rokc RONALD. WEASLEY.
[3:02:37] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Oh yeah, it's gonna be weird going back to Moon Grass if we do get a Demons's Souls remaster
[3:02:42] <+c00lbeans1999> @Mawarup i never really had to farm i just saved soul items for when I ran out, but I've had friends run into the same problem as you
[3:02:49] <%Broand> Oh no am late for the bone cast
[3:02:54] <bashful_bard> Vials are very easy to farm with a max level chalice. Normal enemies in there drop 15k+ souls
[3:03:02] <NiftyNox> DUNK HEAD
[3:03:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> Is Pat a blasphemous?
[3:03:12] <Jontman42> it's just a stabbo
[3:03:19] <%FacetiousAF> you're not a catalyst DansGame
[3:03:24] <NiftyNox> Best weapon in the game
[3:03:30] <FutaSnek> Ah yes the weapon with a literally fucking useless weapon art LUL
[3:03:30] <+GenesisKnight> Graody
[3:03:39] <Mawarup> It's just the early game, I am sure that after stuff opens vial and bullets inventory become moot
[3:03:45] <dinnydanny777> Is that the "dip head in wax' helmet
[3:03:50] <%FacetiousAF> yes dinny
[3:04:00] <FutaSnek> Dont forget to dip
[3:04:00] <%TheDugness> Wear his skin you coward!!!
[3:04:04] <dinnydanny777> Yeah that part was gross
[3:04:11] <+nekodelic> are there any more catalysts in this game?
[3:04:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Mawarup untill you hit a wall boss
[3:04:15] <bashful_bard> Yeah early game vials you're stuck making the yharnam run
[3:04:27] <+Grayhammatter> but he did in fact get up
[3:04:38] <%DensityD> yo did he just walk up, slowly, and
[3:04:38] <%Mendin> I want to know which Librarian had the bright idea of "Let's import some hooligans from the Settlemen and arm them with BURNING AXES in our LIBRARY ARCHIVE"

[3:15:52] <+SaintValiance> The first DS I ever played was 2
[3:15:53] <%CalderGaming> each hand is a Brand attempting to capitalize on BLM
[3:16:05] <%Broand> I feel like this entire part of the game was super easy
[3:16:06] <+SaintValiance> Then I played BB, DS1, then DS3
[3:16:15] <%heartlesshealer> loch shield?
[3:16:16] <+Grayhammatter> wait, the nofires in here? interesting

[3:16:49] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 16m.
[3:16:54] <+SaintValiance> I have to say, I cannot genuinely put DS1 above DS2, because the flaws & strengths of either don't outweigh each other
[3:17:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> Good job
[3:17:09] <NiftyNox> Where is the Bloodborne Wooden Shield in cinders DansGame 0/10 incomplete
[3:17:10] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt stop relying on dark dance it barely does more damage than climax and it hits less often
[3:17:12] <bagelstrider> @PatStaresAt how would you say magic is in 3 in comparison to the other souls games? Im gonna do a playthrough as a mage.
[3:17:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> Wait

[3:17:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> Does light stop the hand?

[3:17:23] <fatherevo> Pats beard is reaching critical mass
[3:17:27] <FutaSnek> @SaintValiance For me DS1 has richer atmosphere but Ds2 is more fun to play
[3:17:43] <+Yatsuhiko> Yatsuhiko subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:17:44] <+Grayhammatter> @doc_ock_rokc the wax does
[3:17:51] <SomeOtherNeb> it looks cool, but god I hate it

[3:17:55] <%heartlesshealer> wax has melted off
[3:18:02] <+SaintValiance> DS1 has way better atmosphere level design, & writing, but DS2 is just a better playing game in like literally every aspect lol

[3:19:09] <%Mendin> oh no
[3:19:11] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt why use dark dance so much? it only does like 200-300 or so more damage than climax but misses way more often and always hits the environment AND is slower?
[3:19:14] <%PirateMike_> Pat will you stream the PS5 event?
[3:19:35] <@SoFarFetched> Scroll down for his schedule
[3:19:36] <TheArrow_> cast speed for dark dance is nuts
[3:19:37] <%PaladinDupre> Hey Pat, I recently started playing Daggerfall Unity, would you ever consider streaming an old school RPG thats been updated for QOL, performance, and mod compatibility?
[3:19:44] <%heartlesshealer> but you use it a lot in narrow spaces, which was probably the source of confusion
[3:19:47] <%PirateMike_> Great :D

[3:35:45] <%AncelDeLambert> that's the Dragon Greatshield
[3:35:49] <penitentpentwitch> For how long Paige hasn't shown up on stream, I half expect her to be Pregananant when we finally do see her.
[3:35:58] <%AncelDeLambert> great dragon? White dragon? Fuck, I forget the full name

[3:37:04] <FutaSnek> I always just run past the 3 dudes and usually like 1 or 2 will suicide on the elevator shaft LUL
[3:37:04] <%AncelDeLambert> what's funny is that repair powder is totally in this game but you NEVER find it, you have to buy it
[3:37:18] <thehighdrated1> The shield tho
[3:37:21] <tusk102> it's almost like using your catalyst as a melee weapon as well makes durability go down
[3:37:23] <Zombrocom> Nah, broke catalyst = less damage
[3:37:34] <%Mendin> Oh because he's a Crystal Lothric Knight I guess
[3:37:39] <cureneckbeard> fix catalyst
[3:37:42] <%AncelDeLambert> spells spam is so real in this mod, that melee or not you're wearing down your catalyst
[3:37:49] <+albedo455> rumored P4G coming to pc

[3:48:26] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> this shield was once used by a dragon as a codpiece
[3:48:31] <%mMayrro> "So I'm going to grind a bit on stream"
[3:48:35] <%AncelDeLambert> why would you farm these guys? You can farm bosses now
[3:48:36] <dinnydanny777> "No one knows why the immortal dragon needed a shield but he did in fact have one"
[3:48:37] <NiftyNox> Jamaican Curried Chicken sounds killer rn
[3:48:38] <%Mendin> @CommanderSqueaks Both, one is tomorrow's lunch
[3:48:43] <%blaggablag> the dragon dick plate shield
[3:48:48] <%AncelDeLambert> AGREED
[3:48:53] <%AncelDeLambert> LEMME SEE THE WHOLE MAP
[3:48:57] <penitentpentwitch> Less assets for them to add to the skybox
[3:49:02] <BliVru> cuse spooky
[3:49:03] <SomeOtherNeb> you don't deserve to see the whole map, chat
[3:49:03] <%heartlesshealer> @EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries You joke, but I bet there's literature about some character doing that
[3:49:06] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt fuck you is why obviously
[3:49:07] <+Grayhammatter> almost enough for insanity
[3:49:10] <%AncelDeLambert> You should be able to see EVERYTHING from up here
[3:49:11] <%PaladinDupre> @PatStaresAt firelinks not a place its a feeling
[3:49:21] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's because the Firelink in the current timeline is shrouded in darkness, probably :)
[3:49:23] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt in and down, silly
[3:49:30] <%ArcanumMBD> firelink was the friends we made along the way
[3:49:34] <penitentpentwitch> What about the hole that leads to the rafters?
[3:49:35] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt there's a braile bible you missed
[3:49:36] <ilpeggiore_> probably for performace
[3:49:37] <dinnydanny777> Fire link isn't real, it can't hurt you
[3:49:39] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> @heartlesshealer NOOOPE don't make that a reality
[3:49:40] <+Grayhammatter> you forgot the inside of the tower pat
[3:49:41] <%Fooguwu> anyone know if it's there if you fly the camera over, or if that area is indeed where the map exists and gets loaded in?
[3:49:41] <BliVru> pat the HOLE you missed
[3:49:41] <%EySoyCoco> did he went to the angel cage?
[3:49:43] <cosmicgoatee> pat no you missed the trails bible behind you
[3:49:51] <BliVru> there was a way down
[3:49:52] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's the one with the coolass spells
[3:49:53] <tusk102> big brain
[3:49:53] <%xeros720> claire bible?

[3:50:01] <NiftyNox> I cant believe you didnt SEE the Braille bible Kappa
[3:50:07] <%AncelDeLambert> down
[3:50:07] <%asgard147> In the angel cage isn't it?
[3:50:07] <%heartlesshealer> @EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries What I mean is it probably already was
[3:50:10] <jellssssss20> Was firelink just always a thing in every timeline?
[3:50:10] <SilverFaustX> the irony
[3:50:12] <%AncelDeLambert> in the cage
[3:50:15] <dinnydanny777> Firelink's existence is collective headcanon
[3:50:15] <Zombrocom> The Cage
[3:50:22] <%xeros720> oh yeah, the cage
[3:50:27] <%mMayrro> holy fuck they gave ludwigs holy sword sacred oath as its WA and its stupid LUL

[3:53:10] <+bionic_hippo> reading kills
[3:53:11] <DayWolfy> that helmet must echo something fierce
[3:53:11] <ilpeggiore_> reading is bad for you
[3:53:15] <Flamefist360> they needed to know
[3:53:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt I guess you could say that those books were....dry
[3:53:16] <Ashecroft> Pat running a new build?
[3:53:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat would never read a book.
[3:53:22] <+Kawaii_Joker> Thats why I don't read
[3:53:23] <%marsproject> Reading is a major cause of hollowing
[3:53:27] <%AncelDeLambert> and now for Pat to try to get 50 Faith so he can play with Angelic Barrage
[3:53:29] <tusk102> @Ashecroft nope
[3:53:30] <%CalderGaming> they all tried to finish Infinite Jest
[3:53:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> When's the last time you read a book?
[3:53:35] <%BubbaRands> Fact: Everyone who has ever read has died!
[3:53:47] <tusk102> @Ashecroft he just grinded ONE MILLION SOULS off stream and is now level 250 ish
[3:53:47] <%PaladinDupre> so do I pat, so do I
[3:53:52] <penitentpentwitch> But we're reading chat now! Oh no!
[3:53:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @CommanderSqueaks Yesterday I was re reading a terry pratchett book
[3:53:57] <%heartlesshealer> hate those soul butterfly angel things. Always creeped me out
[3:54:01] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> estus shard too?
[3:54:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> @doc_ock_rokc I finally decided to bite the bullet and start House of Leaves.
[3:54:13] <cosmicgoatee> oh crap hes only missing one
[3:54:14] <%AncelDeLambert> @doc_ock_rokc you're basically dead already
[3:54:17] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt the firelink greatsword is the ultimate bonfire weapon
[3:54:21] <%heartlesshealer> time for ladle
[3:54:26] <%CalderGaming> @doc_ock_rokc fuck yeah sir terry
[3:54:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AncelDeLambert On the inside
[3:54:33] <MayorRev> @PatStaresAt has elmo ever screamed directly into the mic?
[3:54:35] <tusk102> NOOOOOOOOOOOO
[3:54:40] <%mMayrro> activate the curse
[3:54:41] <Zombrocom> Why not darkmoon covenant?
[3:54:41] <jellssssss20> They're upgrade material arent they?
[3:54:42] <%marsproject> BE A SUN BRO
[3:54:48] <dinnydanny777> Darkness is the heart's true essence after all
[3:54:48] <tusk102> PAT JUST MADE THE ENEMIES 30 % WEAKER
[3:54:48] <cosmicgoatee> anybody remember what shard it was he hasn't gotten yet?
[3:54:50] <jellssssss20> for the ladle?
[3:54:54] <%Mendin> fear not the Dark, my friend. And let the feast begin.
[3:54:55] <%mMayrro> cmon you just going to make the game EASIER?
[3:54:55] <SomeOtherNeb> LUL
[3:54:56] <%xeros720> i think there's a few clean rips of elmo srems
[3:54:59] <%AncelDeLambert> assist the broken butt
[3:55:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh god, wait until Elmo learns how microphones work and just starts screaming directly into them.
[3:55:00] <%CalderGaming> @CommanderSqueaks I've been translating chapters of Moon Gundam from the monthly magazines
[3:55:00] <penitentpentwitch> The braille spells?
[3:55:01] <MayorRev> is paige ok?
[3:55:02] <+GenesisKnight> what about the bible tho
[3:55:09] <+SeanoftheWolf> aren't estus shards upgrade material for the ladle?
[3:55:10] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt please for the love of god activate some curses to compensate for the enemies being 30% weaker now
[3:55:33] <+bulkninja> wtf was that
[3:55:34] <Parapattern> ‚ÄúI was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning I break my legs, and every afternoon I break my arms. At night, I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.‚Äù
[3:55:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> @CalderGaming Can you get with the Hot Chocolate team so they can translate Beastars faster? The Portuguese translators are always beating them by a day or tow
[3:55:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The Curse of Pride is basically free souls
[3:55:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> *two
[3:55:43] <$Wafflum> "And I will find someone to help" is what you should have said LUL
[3:55:44] <+bulkninja> dark souls is so different from when it came out
[3:56:04] <%Sartastic> psaWink
[3:56:05] <penitentpentwitch> Elmo's Dark Soul has been filled with Paige's Light
[3:56:08] <lordchum1150> What about the Braille tome
[3:56:11] <%SiegeJay> @PatStaresAt Are you an American Traitor yet?
[3:56:13] <dinnydanny777> What weapon was that
[3:56:14] <SomeOtherNeb> they buffed them AND ADDED MORE
[3:56:15] <+zanzibar_junker> How's Paige doing chat?
[3:56:21] <%heartlesshealer> tin banishment something
[3:56:22] <%Fooguwu> @bulkninja it's a overhaul mod
[3:56:23] <cosmicgoatee> remember to \[T]/ at that one spot pat
[3:56:26] <%AncelDeLambert> catalyst
[3:56:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> @zanzibar_junker Her ass is still broken.
[3:56:29] <%heartlesshealer> Paige still broken, but slightly less broken
[3:56:30] <+nekodelic> ccatalyst
[3:56:31] <%AncelDeLambert> no, you got the angelic tome
[3:56:32] <dinnydanny777> It sounded cool
[3:56:32] <+Grayhammatter> tin banishment catalyst PogChamp
[3:56:36] <Zombrocom> Did you?
[3:56:36] <penitentpentwitch> You never turned it in for the spells?
[3:56:39] <%CalderGaming> @CommanderSqueaks sadly I am very much a solo amateur and outside of the fan translation community
[3:56:43] <%Mendin> One Guy'd
[3:56:44] <+Dotta5> buffed skeleton like people? don't tell Paige
[3:56:44] <SilverFaustX> lobosBlind
[3:56:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's poetic that Pat can't seem to see the tome made for blind people.
[3:56:59] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt you should turn on the boss hp regen since you punk bosses so easily lol
[3:56:59] <%AncelDeLambert> it's fine, it's not like Angelic Barrage can hit the princes anyways
[3:57:05] <+bulkninja> god damn i have to play dark souls, there s so much new shit
[3:57:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> Bonetrussle plays in the distance
[3:57:15] <%AncelDeLambert> fucking hell the tracking on turret spells is such a mess
[3:57:42] <+Kawaii_Joker> Sick jizz cannon
[3:57:46] <funwashere> !uptime
[3:57:46] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 57m.
[3:57:49] <DayWolfy> climax indeed
[3:57:49] <JetpackMcQuack> This bridge is great
[3:57:52] <%twohitgood> this actually feels more like a solid line of defense.
[3:57:53] <tusk102> @bulkninja this isn't new dark souls stuff, this is a mod
[3:58:04] <fringespider> Is this one of them viable magic builds? I've missed old streams rip
[3:58:07] <JetpackMcQuack> Just a big ol' battle
[3:58:08] <SnaKemuho> I wonder if multiple people can DMC-juggle enemies in the air like that
[3:58:20] <%AncelDeLambert> WAHOO
[3:58:21] <+bulkninja> @tusk102 thanks for clarifying lol
[3:58:22] <%DensityD> you can do it pat. you're so good at the game
[3:58:24] <tusk102> @fringespider he's using a mod

[3:58:32] <Lyncei> did they include the blue flame blade I miss it so
[3:58:42] <vinceshamwowslap> There‚Äôs a whole army now
[3:58:44] <+zanzibar_junker> This is a lot like Nioh with all the range options
[3:58:45] <Zombrocom> @Lyncei They did!
[3:58:46] <%Taisuru> @tusk102 You'd think people would know these things from the stream title
[3:58:51] <fringespider> @tusk102 I know just wondering what build hes gone with
[3:58:54] <@SoFarFetched> heh "Peck" at the chicken
[3:58:59] <jellssssss20> Still streaming for a while?
[3:59:01] <%DensityD> the bird man pecks

[3:59:20] <%heartlesshealer> oh man
[3:59:23] <%AncelDeLambert> Fetched has such a foul mouth psaSmug
[3:59:27] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt those guys were always there and are always just as rad
[3:59:27] <SomeOtherNeb> this part is bullshit with a melee build
[3:59:28] <+Grayhammatter> these guys as well? wow
[3:59:29] <agrippaarpeggio> What else did you expect?

[3:59:43] <%twohitgood> was that a jerrel clone?
[3:59:43] <%WhereIsWill> oops! all buffs!
[3:59:46] <cosmicgoatee> the backdown
[3:59:46] <fringespider> @tusk102 oof
[3:59:48] <%AncelDeLambert> well that's why you hyper abuse weapon arts when melee
[3:59:51] <pitsuji> what version of cinders is this
[3:59:51] <%Alpha8087> Oh lawd they comin
[3:59:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> Finally listened to Pat talking about his family's history with cooking, and his grandmother's cooking was ALMOST enough to make me loose my appetite, which has literally never happened once in my entire life.
[3:59:55] <%Pilzkun> dis boi strong
[3:59:58] <%DensityD> you're playing with the big boys now
[3:59:59] <%AncelDeLambert> @pitsuji latest

[4:00:06] <%AncelDeLambert> he just updated it today
[4:00:08] <%BubbaRands> thats some good D
[4:00:19] <tusk102> @fringespider he calls himself a hexer but then grinded off screen so hard that he's level 250 something and has 99 int but only has 20 faith
[4:00:19] <Kirbachev> And this is why I always put 20 into Int and abuse Hidden Body, no matter what kind of build I'm doing
[4:00:23] <Kirbachev> Saves a shitton of trouble
[4:00:25] <%ArcanumMBD> @CommanderSqueaks what just scrape the green parts off, it's fine
[4:00:26] <JetpackMcQuack> Tripping over the corpses of their former army
[4:00:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh hey buddy
[4:00:36] <pitsuji> i guess thats where the health comes from
[4:00:38] <%AncelDeLambert> at least lightning is good for taking these guys out
[4:00:42] <%SiegeJay> I saw ZeroLenny's Video of this mod, Does Pat have the secret boss?
[4:00:45] <DayWolfy> Ah yes my favorite spell "Melt Lifebar"
[4:00:51] <squirtkitten> over 5k health on a normal enemy LUL

[4:01:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ArcanumMBD You know what's worse? If that's how his grandmother cooked, how bad was his GREAT grandmother?
[4:01:12] <%heartlesshealer> look around
[4:01:12] <Parapattern> I cast explode your dick
[4:01:14] <%xeros720> feels like the devs wanted a lot more rpg in this

[4:01:47] <penitentpentwitch> Now for the chest under the elevator?
[4:01:49] <%SiegeJay> @SQDizzy Yes. A non-canon boss made by the creator is a secret boss fight
[4:01:50] <%mMayrro> like 3 at least

[4:15:21] <%Gallhint> Steak, butter, herbs, potatoes, a good salad
[4:15:22] <FutaSnek> there u go
[4:15:23] <%Mrbaconator> you forgot salt and pepper
[4:15:23] <bashful_bard> Step 1.5 let it unthaw
[4:15:23] <+Radalorian> add butter to them steaks for a moist treat
[4:15:23] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Steak salads are good
[4:15:23] <%xeros720> the wait part is pretty important
[4:15:24] <+Nejums> S and P is the way for me
[4:15:24] <%WhereIsWill> dont forget a dash o salt tho!
[4:15:25] <%Prism_Wing> season it also
[4:15:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, PAN?!
[4:15:28] <%weissguard> You forgot the crucial step: Season that bitch!
[4:15:30] <dinnydanny777> Pies are nice with steak
[4:15:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Who cooks a steak on a pan!?
[4:15:33] <+krawtch> thaw steaks. heat steaks. take steaks off heat once juices start coming out. eat steaks.
[4:15:33] <%walternatorz> pat's such a foodie
[4:15:34] <%weissguard> *BAM
[4:15:34] <%coreyyotto> Korean beef bowl my man
[4:15:34] <cureneckbeard> PanStaresAt
[4:15:35] <%FacetiousAF> S n Ps the choice for me, bud
[4:15:36] <SGrim> Use a combination of water, flour and steak grease to create gravy. Put gravy on steak.
[4:15:36] <+Kiaayo> you should probabl flip it at least once
[4:15:37] <%RPG_CHICAGO> SEASON YOUR STEAK, YOU HEATHEN
[4:15:38] <%Mendin> Slice steam thin when cold, stirfry
[4:15:43] <%AgniBrandt> Jesus fuck Pat do you not season your steak?
[4:15:43] <%maskofmichael> Any cooking advice for a guy with a freezer filled with tv dinners?
[4:15:44] <%Takreth> I put a can of heat on the steak and nothing is happening please help
[4:15:44] <%xeros720> yeah, salt and pepper is needed for just about cooking any meat
[4:15:46] <%Gallhint> Eat that baby blue rare
[4:15:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Stir Fry is the exception.
[4:15:46] <penitentpentwitch> You walked past it
[4:15:48] <+Lizard0TM> Missed chest in boss room
[4:15:48] <%mMayrro> psaBlind
[4:15:48] <%BubbaRands> I missed a step and now my steak is attacking me please HEP
[4:15:51] <%heartlesshealer> Pat, when you're done with this part of quest, check prince room
[4:15:51] <farrellcityking> No seasoning?
[4:15:53] <+pkmamsters> butter and garlic
[4:15:54] <farrellcityking> Yuck
[4:15:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> If not that, grilled or smoked is the only acceptable way to have steak.
[4:15:56] <+azacado> if youve got alot of steak, you could make some bomb ass mince and make soe kick ass burgers
[4:15:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> @CommanderSqueaks A cast iron pan is the best way to cookm a steak
[4:16:01] <%VHGS> I like how chat reminds pat to use seasoning but not to take the steak out of the very hot pan
[4:16:02] <SGrim> @maskofmichael thrown them away and just eat cardboard
[4:16:03] <SomeOtherNeb> @BubbaRands did you remember to kill the cow first
[4:16:10] <farrellcityking> Eat steak half raw with no seasoning. Yum!
[4:16:10] <%Prism_Wing> Just surgically insert the steak into your stomach 4Head
[4:16:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> @rumtumtugnutz I will fight to the death over this. Grilled or death.

[4:18:00] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt later
[4:18:02] <SomeOtherNeb> maybe reload the area first?
[4:18:02] <%heartlesshealer> not sure
[4:18:04] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt You likely need to reload the area first
[4:18:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> @CommanderSqueaks I fear you are correct. Now I can never share with you my recipe for Potato Salad.

[4:24:32] <bashful_bard> DS2 was bad for a lot of reasons, but fan service wasn't one
[4:24:35] <%Quigsies> @SomeOtherNeb DS2 did it the best! It was set so far in the future and did relatively little fanservice compared to this game
[4:24:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> So, we're all in agreement, literally all 3 games are completely Gwyn's fault, right?
[4:24:55] <%heartlesshealer> quivering
[4:25:04] <captainpotato009> Smack his shit in!
[4:25:06] <SomeOtherNeb> @Quigsies I did think that Ornstein being there was nonsensical but yeah the rest was fine, honestly
[4:25:07] <Zombrocom> Literally everything is Gwyn's fault
[4:25:09] <tusk102> @CommanderSqueaks all of dark souls is his fault
[4:25:10] <+Grayhammatter> time to blast his ass with dark mass

[4:25:21] <%heartlesshealer> Yup, Gwyn did all of it for a nightlight
[4:25:22] <+lethallylactic> When in doubt, it's Gwyn's fault.
[4:25:23] <RagingLeo> "festering" ew
[4:25:28] <dinnydanny777> Isn't a lot of the stuff that's more important in this game from DS2 while a lot of the stuff from DS1 is kind of fanservicey

[4:26:29] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt You can buy Rosaria soul from Rosaria
[4:26:30] <%animaturgy> You but the rest at handmaiden, yeah
[4:26:32] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt you only received his mask. the handmaiden has his armor
[4:26:37] <Zombrocom> It's next to the xanthous hat
[4:26:48] <bashful_bard> Nothing was important relating to DS2 in this game. They went out of their way to make sure new lore and DS1 lore were the only relevant factors
[4:26:54] <+krawtch> simp armor gives you 20% less souls because you donate them to get nothing in return
[4:26:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> We're TF2 up in here right now.

[4:27:00] <+PapermanXD> it's only simp armor because leonhardt was wearing it
[4:27:15] <tusk102> @PatStaresAt you should really put your armor away
[4:27:21] <%redrins> it was the basic bitch head piece for ds3 vanilla players
[4:27:25] <penitentpentwitch> I think the only thing close to relevant to DS2 in DS3 was the Shrine Handmaiden looking like the old women of DS2?
[4:27:26] <AdmiralButtloaf> now pat gives the worst head
[4:27:27] <%heartlesshealer> prince room or more quest?
[4:27:28] <dinnydanny777> @bashful_bard Some of the DLC locations are straight locations from DS2

[4:28:51] <tusk102> it's not actually
[4:28:52] <%EldritchBee> Tri angle
[4:28:53] <%PaladinDupre> for the effect
[4:28:55] <+nekodelic> I think you got a new catalyst right before fighting the brothers
[4:28:58] <%CalderGaming> @BliVru I was referencing the They Might Be Giants song, and I'm sure he was too...

[4:29:37] <$stayballsy1927> are we beating the game today patrick?
[4:29:38] <%heartlesshealer> happ birth Rosaria
[4:29:45] <SomeOtherNeb> reviving a dead woman, the ultimate simping
[4:29:47] <%DensityD> the magic hex build
[4:29:49] <Sunstalker> Just as hot as Gwynnevere. rooNya
[4:29:52] <%PaladinDupre> just shove it back in
[4:29:54] <+Lizard0TM> yes
[4:29:55] <%mMayrro> if only their bodies didn't desintegrate
[4:29:56] <+tigerfang86> I mean that's how souls work in this world
[4:29:56] <SnaKemuho> but their bodies disappear
[4:29:56] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, pretty weird
[4:29:58] <tusk102> @captain_jee a "hexer" but he hasn't put hardly anything faith so it's actually just a normal int build
[4:29:59] <+tigerfang86> in general
[4:30:01] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt You can buuy her soul from Rosaria
[4:30:01] <%Gallhint> souls are essentially batteries
[4:30:02] <FutaSnek> Just SQUEEEEZE IT back in'
[4:30:02] <$lotharrio> Most don't leave bodies.
[4:30:04] <%Treuan> @SomeOtherNeb Orpheus: The ultimate simp
[4:30:04] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> YES pat that's how death works Kappa
[4:30:04] <Monkeyweed21> Death is a funny concept in Dark Souls
[4:30:05] <+tigerfang86> but yeah their bodies mostly explode
[4:30:06] <Kirbachev> And here we are munching on souls to power up
[4:30:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Just stop eating them, you greedy madman
[4:30:09] <+chaggles> Is it not cause shes has rebirth and stuff?
[4:30:13] <silver__viii> but without their soul how are you gonna get big
[4:30:18] <captain_jee> @tusk102 TY
[4:30:19] <%Gallhint> instead of duracell its durasoul
[4:30:20] <AdmiralButtloaf> if their bodies didnt dissapear

[4:30:23] <dinnydanny777> Where do you go when you die in Dark Souls
[4:30:23] <Zombrocom> true*
[4:30:29] <Ashecroft> Thats only really something that happens with Fire Keepers isnt it?

[4:33:23] <dinnydanny777> A Cannon
[4:33:26] <$lotharrio> It's probably the biggest, strongest, most super weapon in the game.
[4:33:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> @AncelDeLambert 100% chest completion

[4:47:45] <%depressed_skeleton> its not "Out" its probably demo still
[4:47:50] <%Binary_Fireball> ITS OUT OF THIS WORLD
[4:47:51] <cureneckbeard> mcdm on twitch is playing star citizen recently
[4:47:51] <+krawtch> beta is not out
[4:47:52] <%xeros720> if we can't buy a copy and play it, it ain't fuckin out

[4:47:53] <%Binary_Fireball> BECAUSE SPACE
[4:47:53] <%bluescreen1988> early access as fuck
[4:47:54] <cureneckbeard> you can watch the vods

[4:47:56] <0rond> @PatStaresAt did you see the P4G leak?
[4:48:00] <%depressed_skeleton> 3
[4:48:00] <%maskofmichael> psa1guy

[4:48:03] <TheArrow_> @Binary_Fireball ayyyy
[4:48:05] <+Armeggadon> It's not out, but it's got tons of playable content if you do want to play it
[4:48:05] <G03933> LUL its a scam, if it comes out it wont make money anymore
[4:48:09] <Klefth> Star Citizen is a pyramid scheme
[4:48:10] <%maenos2> it'll never be out, they got JPGs to sell
[4:48:10] <@SoFarFetched> Can't believe futurecity lied.
[4:48:14] <%0oki> it will never be out just give more money for more development, never out!
[4:48:18] <+jjjkopf> just give them some more money
[4:48:20] <%BubbaRands> I'd believe Half-life 3 over Star Citizen being out
[4:48:25] <cureneckbeard> MCDM on Twitch was playing Star Citizen yesterday
[4:48:32] <%xeros720> oh fuck yeah, they cut the ending for dlc and never finished it, yeah?
[4:48:33] <%bevyrage> pat wants the stick to drop the carrot at some point
[4:48:35] <%coreyyotto> That's a terrible reason. The side quests are kino
[4:48:37] <+krawtch> remind me, does Destiny 2 have an ending
[4:48:47] <%heartlesshealer> "parts" of Star Citizen are completed, not the whole thing
[4:48:48] <%DensityD> the future
[4:48:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Mankind Divided sucks for the no ending part, but at least the part that was there was pretty good
[4:48:56] <%JD_Lars> Paramount just cancelled COPS after 31 years on the air in wake of the protests. I didn‚Äôt even know it was still being filmed.
[4:48:57] <%Gallhint> Oh shit remember when Mankind divided caught shit for Aug Lives Matter?
[4:48:59] <%maenos2> guy who wrote dead space apparently has something at the ps5 conference
[4:49:01] <Monkeyweed21> The final mission has a REAL GOOD PART in it regarding a decision
[4:49:02] <%xeros720> shame the corporate shills had to fuck it up
[4:49:07] <%SiegeJay> You are not giving bullshit the finger you clearly are helping it
[4:49:09] <%redrins> after not finishing p5r Kappa
[4:49:17] <%coreyyotto> Like Pat, all of your go-to games are defined by having no ending. e.g. FFXIV
[4:49:17] <%bevyrage> @krawtch in the same sense that a road ends because construction hasn't finished it yet
[4:49:17] <%Frost_Quill> Make Paige play P4G. Make her play the whole thing.
[4:49:18] <ExpressNode> I should bust my PS TV out of quarantine
[4:49:28] <%xeros720> Paige 4 Golden would be pretty great
[4:49:33] <+krawtch> remember when Human Revolution was coming out in July and they completely fucked up by not delaying it til AUGust

[4:50:26] <%heartlesshealer> RUBBER BULLETS HAVE FORCE BEHIND THEM
[4:50:28] <@SoFarFetched> because rubber bullets aren't fully rubber.
[4:50:30] <Monkeyweed21> For the curious it's "We can't Breathe but we're alive"
[4:50:34] <$Dakuu75> LOL
[4:50:34] <+krawtch> rubber bullets have iron cores
[4:50:35] <+kanaydian> @SiegeJay rubber bullets are metal coated in rubber
[4:50:40] <%FacetiousAF> @SiegeJay my knowledge is they're designed to get bounced off the ground first and not go straight to the target
[4:50:44] <%heartlesshealer> they were never not lethal. It only depends on where you aim
[4:50:49] <%bevyrage> rubber bullets are repurposed mouse track balls fired from a gun
[4:50:50] <%Foopoof> @monkeyweed21 tanks
[4:50:51] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Rubber bullets also have a metal core
[4:50:51] <j0ustar> @SiegeJay easily. You're NOT supposed to point those at people. you shoot the floor.
[4:50:52] <SGrim> @SiegeJay they can easily break bones if fired at targets less than 15 yards away
[4:50:56] <+kanaydian> they aren't lethal, they're made to be shot at people's legs
[4:50:59] <%Spydurman> rubber bullets were designed to be shot on the ground and bounce, direct shots at close range are SUPER dangerous
[4:51:02] <%bluescreen1988> cops like to fire em at point blank range which your not supposed to do
[4:51:06] <%Diana869> "Rubber" bullets
[4:51:07] <ilpeggiore_> he doesn't look or listen to you, but loves your stream lol
[4:51:09] <$Dakuu75> @bevyrage WOW, they weaponized the 90's?!

[4:51:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "Paint?"
[4:51:50] <Monkeyweed21> Rubber bullets aren't lethal can still cause damage pretty bad, they're designed for subduing raging drug addicts and other people that cant be stopped by bodily force
