[0:16:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> @spongeofmystery The chickens slowly lay eggs indefinitely. Saving and loading can speed it up. There's a point where you can reach the chickens and merchant at the same time, and make all the money.
[0:16:26] <auraofdawn> There‚Äôs a few documentaries about it
[0:16:27] <%theKingRamses> there was an agreement made to eat each other on natural death

That shit only *starts* in your guts, it's not like tapeworms. It quickly moves to your muscle meat and then makes cysts that hurt a lot. Apparently it's typical in these infections for something like 10 worms in every 1 gram of muscle.dont worry:eventually the cysts calcify and traps the worms forever.

[1:40:32] <TyrianPurpleHaze> This is correct, the textures were dogshit.
[1:40:33] <%BlackFangTech> European eggs don't need to be refrigerated because they don't wash them. Washing them removes the outer coating that prevents bacterial infiltration.

[1:41:35] <Run44forrest> StinkyCheese
[1:41:35] <%ha2ken> The alert had English subs. LUL
[1:41:35] <%ShichiNoBushi> Leon has a translation app.
[1:41:37] <%trekkie11041> @AngriestPat the red cats eye is in a birds nest outside the cabin where you find lewis in the closet
[1:41:37] <iamnotaparrot> the biggest tell on how bad the textures are is the typewriter. it's blurry and weird in og versions and in HD it clearly says amenhotep
[1:41:37] <%Takreth> Leon using google glasses
[1:41:37] <%Dragovus> It's in English because shut up
[1:41:37] <+C24U> Leon has special contact lenses that translate for him
[1:41:40] <%linkster291> Nah, Leon can read Spanish.
[1:41:43] <%MachineHead9> apatWink

[1:41:46] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> CHAT when did he complete re 0?
[1:41:47] <%Mekhet09> Leon can read spanish
[1:41:47] <%spiritofmojave> Not Spain makes sure to make its subs accurate
[1:41:48] <+b_bang_> so leon could pick i tup and read all the mean things about him of course
[1:41:48] <Run44forrest> BIG StinkyCheese
[1:41:48] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Leon KNOWS Spanish, he just can't speak it for shit.
[1:41:49] <%linkster291> So he just translates it for us.
[1:41:49] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat you missed ammo on the op of the house
[1:41:50] <Mexrage> HD mod goal is to make it look as close as the original in design as possible, to the point of they took photos of the places capcom used as samples to make the original textures
[1:41:51] <%JJCheeker> Why do every alien species speak English in Star Trek
[1:41:51] <%solidousstream> MENDOOOOOSAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!
[1:41:52] <Ran196> don't forget to shoot the wooden board in the well before the jewel

[1:42:11] <djazo> logic and RE games LUL
[1:42:11] <+PlagueOfGripes> the real question is, why are these documents written in Japanese
[1:42:12] <%jorniev> HUNNIGAN TRANSLATES FOR HIM THNAKS TO HIS i droid
[1:42:14] <ricky12k> So next up tower. Nice.
[1:42:15] <%StaceMcGate> and it doesn't need ribbons
[1:42:17] <%Bt_Robot> I remeber these!
[1:42:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> Leon, you'll need to find and recruit someone with the Spanish Interpreter ability.
[1:42:18] <%majima666> we're still part of the continent of europe. just not the european union lol
[1:42:18] <CrimsonFox777> They're not, Leon just understands the native language.
[1:42:20] <%zamzoph> Zoomers don't even know what typewriters are
[1:42:22] <%nofestu2> i THOUGHT THEY ONLY HAD QUILLS HERE
[1:42:24] <Griffin1171> Jesus Christ save games

[1:42:24] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 42m.
[1:42:27] <zenith0111> Plague asking the real questions;
[1:42:28] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> GUYS when did he finish re 0?
[1:42:31] <gfkxj> NG speed run on professional is literally like 90 minutes simply because letting players buy the rocket launcher whenever is broken.
[1:42:32] <biomegabear> @AngriestPat make sure when you beat del lago go backwards
[1:42:34] <Griffin1171> poop

[1:42:38] <%majima666> but nuff about that bullshit, sick of the whole thing lmao
[1:42:38] <cureneckbeard> Do you still need ink ribbons in this
[1:42:41] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @MrAtheGreat Yup, and theres even some interactions that also scale. Hitting an armored Garrador's plaga spot also scales damage. But it doesnt scale for a normal garrador weirdly enough
[1:42:41] <trulythedude> ohhhhhhh
[1:42:43] <%lockbreaker> @eattheb0otylikegroceries like last night

[1:42:53] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> @lockbreaker tyvm!
[1:42:54] <$spleekle> The poop devalues treasure, a lesson well learn
[1:42:54] <%ScreamLord> And somehow the bullet doesn't obliterate the pendent
[1:42:55] <+LeonPup> GET EGGS
[1:42:55] <chisanakitsune> Get the eggs
[1:42:57] <%ha2ken> Do a suplex Pat.

[1:43:23] <Run44forrest> nice one pat
[1:43:24] <zenith0111> @cureneckbeard Take everything you know about RE and throw it out the window. RE4 tried to expand the gameplay in new ways

[1:43:32] <mankeytennis> the anti-huey
[1:43:32] <42nfl19> @angriestpat how do you know if they are in the kickable state?

[1:43:37] <%spiritofmojave> NO THATS A BAD TO DO
[1:43:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> @plagueofgripes It's the most shit-filled water ever.
[1:43:37] <%kingbaconcrispy> If you don't remember RE4 you're a fake gamer! It's okay to forget RE0 though.
[1:43:38] <+b_bang_> the animals need to eat too
[1:43:38] <%ha2ken> Do not shoot doggo

[1:57:32] <daisyyyy> Leon works for the US Government hes STILL a Cop

[1:57:44] <dabeaminator> A test of strength
[1:57:44] <Drivershaft> the guy is coming to kill Luis, not Leon
[1:57:44] <+REDtheBEAST> He wanted revenge.
[1:57:45] <Jolly_Adventurer> He was probably going rouge and wanted to kill him
[1:57:45] <+TSmasher1000> This game is for gameplay not story Pat
[1:57:46] <%sporeian94> but the virus resserects the dead right?

[1:57:55] <TheIronBrass> BOO
[1:57:55] <+bubblebasspickles> haHAA
[1:57:55] <%Caped_Eggy> He was just a normal dude, injured
[1:57:56] <@absolute_weapon> That was the guy in the house!
[1:57:56] <%jorniev> THUNDER LEGS LEON
[1:57:57] <tusk102> @AngriestPat dead bodies still become zombies
[1:57:57] <gfkxj> The number of enemies who will purposefully damage or kill Ashley even while she is standing away from Leon, completely ruins the plan to send ashley back infected.
[1:57:58] <young_sn0w> IT BETTER BE PRO
[1:57:58] <morcego_cinzento_arts> "I think i saw a sample of the virus at the lab of the department" Why isn't Leon freaking out over that line. Like the fucking Virus that turned an entire city into a living hell of undead and monsters?
[1:57:59] <%Kegeto> So how did saddler got a hold of the virus?
[1:57:59] <+JohnTimbre> Why do they keep chasing Ashley after she's infected when Leon saves her if they want her near the President anyway?
[1:57:59] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @dabeaminator what did he say again?
[1:58:00] <%Dragovus> @AngriestPat That's the first guy you fight in the game, He's mad cause you messed him up
[1:58:00] <omen_setter> sensible chuckle!
[1:58:00] <%Shadicara> Pat do you think Leon could kick a boulder into submission?
[1:58:01] <grimm_hatter> theory is that's the guy you kill first
[1:58:01] <+Rishnix> That guy went rogue.
[1:58:01] <%Pappajimbo> I assume this one was fucked up and killing just for itself
[1:58:02] <Griffin1171> PUN
[1:58:02] <@absolute_weapon> Super mad
[1:58:03] <%MachineHead9> it's the crazy guy
[1:58:03] <ZazzyDoesStuff> Dude was there to kill luois
[1:58:03] <TyrianPurpleHaze> The PLAN is that they get sent back and secretly infect the president, but they keep trying to KILL them.
[1:58:04] <%peachy996> Ganado aren't individuals hence the name ganado
[1:58:05] <mondo_cl> you broke into his house and shot him
[1:58:07] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @AngriestPat Chief Mendez wants to kill them, Saddler wants Leon turned
[1:58:07] <kazadog> Hunnigan Kreygasm
[1:58:08] <wrydiculous> yeah why does a madrid precinct have a sample of the super dangerous af virus?
[1:58:08] <%President_Miyazaki> Is it to kill them before Ada frees them?
[1:58:10] <%Razputin217> BOOOO

[1:58:14] <%FalseEyeD> Plague is max cooming
[1:58:14] <tusk102> @AngriestPat dead bodies can still become zombies
[1:58:15] <CrimsonFox777> Lack of communication with the rank and file
[1:58:16] <+ZedSlayer> poor jacket
[1:58:20] <%legendscar01> THE STRANGER
[1:58:20] <+C24U> The reason is at this point the Chief doesn't know he has been infected yet
[1:58:20] <%Bt_Robot> Those wriggly tentacle things do a poor job of long term planning.
[1:58:21] <%XeroSigmaPrime> OVER HERE STRANGER

[2:35:21] <%kingofcinders> If you're going with the 'headshot -> kick -> knife' playstyle then the TMP is ridiculous for how much ammo you get, you never need to use a handgun ever again.

[2:36:42] <%TaphexWin> What is actually the worst gun in this game? Probably the mine thrower?
[2:36:43] <+b_bang_> yee

[2:36:46] <%luftraumm1> this game is soooooo dumb

[2:36:50] <+thesw1tch> i wish the merchant showed up again in future games. can you imagine ethan from re7 seeing his ass in the swamps?
[2:36:51] <%ape_hawk> so its a money shot?

[2:36:55] <dabeaminator> You discovered the jewelry mine
[2:36:56] <cureneckbeard> I like how shooting down a jewel doesn't damage it in any way

[2:37:15] <Shwepie> Mask bits that you find after the mask.
[2:37:17] <zenith0111> Doesn't this game have a dynamic ammo loot table? Like the more you use one kind of Weapon the more ammo for it you find?
[2:37:18] <corepercentlives> a face?
[2:37:19] <%luftraumm1> @doc_ock_rokc I always forget just how dumb it gets

[2:37:25] <TriadOrion> The beerstein ones are Catseyes I think?
[2:37:30] <%ElenaManetta> RE4 was the first RE game I ever paid attention to as a teen, so when I was introduced to the idea that the series WASN'T just a bunch of gothic castle zombies and that there were other protagonists besides Leon, I was confused.
[2:37:31] <SpoonDawg> @corepercentlives lol

[2:40:04] <+DeaconBluesClues> well, this is interesting
[2:40:04] <%XeroSigmaPrime> STRIKER
[2:40:05] <hzealot> @AngriestPat mine layer?
[2:40:05] <iamnotaparrot> TMP DPS is insane. The TMP shreds the salazar fight
[2:40:07] <+LeonPup> semi-auto and striker
[2:40:09] <%Â§©‰Ωø42199> semi auto rifle ?
[2:40:09] <+soundcloud_raptor> some people say i eat too many chocolate bars, or i dont wash my face. but its not true
[2:40:10] <%XeroSigmaPrime> NOT RIOT GUN, STRIKER

[2:40:11] <%shanedelbon> shanedelbon subscribed at Tier 1.

[2:40:17] <+C24U> Rocket Launcher-chan special appeance
[2:40:17] <%Taisuru> MINE THROWER
[2:40:18] <+shaderichter_belmont> ewww the TMP
[2:40:18] <wrydiculous> dun upgrade the rifle if you wanna focus the semi auto
[2:40:18] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> mine thrower
[2:40:18] <Peculiar_Pangolin> save money for semi-auto rifle imo
[2:40:19] <+RadDude6969> BAR Kreygasm
[2:40:20] <Sapphire_Breeze> RIOT GUN IS DOPE
[2:40:21] <Corporate_Redeemer> KILLER 7, YA COWARD
[2:40:23] <faithless_zealot> F the striker
[2:40:24] <jhonxiolonn> Stay with the first shotgun
[2:40:26] <%XeroSigmaPrime> STRIKER IS RIDICIOUSLY BETTER
[2:40:26] <%peachy996> Mine Thrower is only for funsies
[2:40:27] <%TaphexWin> Dude the 100 round mag in the striker is dumb
[2:40:28] <konami2010> riot gun is bae
[2:40:28] <wrydiculous> striker forever
[2:40:29] <%Konquerer> you only need a good shotgun
[2:40:29] <morcego_cinzento_arts> aren't you gonna get the semi rifle and striker later?
[2:40:30] <%Chatterbox1991> KILLER 7
[2:40:31] <mankeytennis> good choice, sir
[2:40:31] <biomegabear> Is mine thrower even good?
[2:40:32] <Slimeking_Mike> MINELAYER BICH
[2:40:32] <%ha2ken> Stryker is so good th
[2:40:33] <zenith0111> OG SHOTTY
[2:40:33] <RunningNGunning> Semi-auto rifle is better than rifle when its upgraded imo
[2:40:36] <iamnotaparrot> broken butterfly is free
[2:40:36] <faithless_zealot> STRIKER IS BORING
[2:40:36] <+RadDude6969> ditman glitch
[2:40:36] <%Darren716> Yeah because striker is the best!
[2:40:37] <%peachy996> Mine Thrower is the gimmick gun
[2:40:37] <%PanicSwytch> Riot gun is better
[2:40:37] <+thesw1tch> striker best gun in the game
[2:40:37] <%XeroSigmaPrime> STRIKER IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH BETTER
[2:40:37] <Corporate_Redeemer> MINE THROWER ONLY
[2:40:37] <%tiaramaki> Striker glitch wacky and cool tho
[2:40:39] <%ElenaManetta> why do different things
[2:40:40] <%Darren716> Fucking 100 rounds
[2:40:40] <%segonian> yes! impulse decisions!
[2:40:40] <chisanakitsune> Riot gun is strictly worse
[2:40:41] <%Mekhet09> minelayer though.
[2:40:42] <+LeonPup> SEmi auto all the way
[2:40:42] <jhonxiolonn> semi auto is broken
[2:40:43] <tusk102> @TaphexWin he knows he used it in the lp lol
[2:40:43] <konami2010> doing it without semiauto SUCKS
[2:40:44] <%sinistersally> red 9 and sniper only
[2:40:44] <%Â§©‰Ωø42199> semi auto is better
[2:40:44] <ChivesPotato> BOLT
[2:40:46] <+luketrapwalker> PAIGE CHECK
[2:40:46] <faithless_zealot> @AngriestPat Semi-auto is just better...
[2:40:47] <Viaquez> bolt
[2:40:47] <OkamiDude15> fire power
[2:40:48] <FatherGreyBeard> BOLT IS HOT
[2:40:48] <Peculiar_Pangolin> Semi auto 100%
[2:40:49] <%ralphfromdk> Semi makes it easier if you ever miss
[2:40:49] <%Sausious> bolt kicks ass
[2:40:49] <%XeroSigmaPrime> bolt action is basically a magnum
[2:40:49] <%SolidusRex> Riotgun is the Chad choice
[2:40:50] <+C24U> Not worth upgrading this one
[2:40:50] <Sapphire_Breeze> semi auto is too good
[2:40:50] <konami2010> you WANT that semiauto
[2:40:50] <hzealot> @AngriestPat just save your money for big upgrades later
[2:40:50] <+thesw1tch> semi auto
[2:40:50] <%Aydarkzero> problem w/ striker is it has low damage at far range compared to Riot and Shotgun
[2:40:50] <%Chatterbox1991> BOLT
[2:40:51] <FirearmsInstructor> Semi > bolt.... but bolt is fun / cool :)
[2:40:52] <%StoicMoogle> Max the reg rifle!
[2:40:53] <%Darren716> Semi all day
[2:40:53] <%Dr_Mooose> semi
[2:40:53] <Corporate_Redeemer> You can use the thermal scope with the bolt
[2:40:53] <TriadOrion> The normal Rifle gets like Magnum Strong at max upgrades
[2:40:53] <tusk102> semi auto
[2:40:54] <%peachy996> Semi-Auto has Thermal Scope
[2:40:54] <MetroidSlayerP7> Bolt action > semi-auto. Reload is cooler
[2:40:54] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Also i love the mine thrower but it's not good for a first run. laways use it on game plus
[2:40:55] <daemos123> semi auto
[2:40:57] <dabeaminator> Are there limited resources for upgrading?
[2:40:58] <%CygnusRoboticus> bolt-action does more damage?
[2:40:58] <mankeytennis> Rifle
[2:41:00] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> Red9 and kicks only
[2:41:01] <%MrAtheGreat> FUCK IT TMP has GOT SPEED FOR EVERYONE
[2:41:02] <majindusto> BOLT
[2:41:03] <zenith0111> I beat this whole game with just the pistol and shotgun no upgrades. I was a dumb child LUL
[2:41:04] <+RadDude6969> semi auto DansGame
[2:41:05] <%CygnusRoboticus> it upgrades to as much as a magnum
[2:41:05] <wrydiculous> semi auto helps a hell lot against regenerators
[2:41:05] <%trekkie11041> dont you need the semi auto for regeneradors? @AngriestPat
[2:41:05] <%ha2ken> Bolt much more satisfying and less inventory
[2:41:09] <dreadnaught513> Semi auto for re-generators
[2:41:10] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat the exclusive is on this rifle is the 30.00 firepower
[2:41:11] <%Aleate> I agree
[2:41:12] <RunningNGunning> THE GOBLINS ARE BACK
[2:41:12] <%theKingRamses> true
[2:41:12] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @AngriestPat Bolt action upgrade makes it on par as a magnum
[2:41:13] <+Lord_of_all_Edges> It is the law.
[2:41:13] <%anticrust> true
[2:41:13] <+b_bang_> true
[2:41:13] <%Dr_Mooose> true
[2:41:14] <King_Wolf_Rigger> BIG AGREE
[2:41:14] <Corporate_Redeemer> Bolt can use the thermal scope
[2:41:14] <+luketrapwalker> How's Paige doing over there?
[2:41:15] <hzealot> then turn it too
[2:41:15] <%CygnusRoboticus> bolt more firepowerrrrrr
[2:41:15] <%ElenaManetta> man, canada is FULL of bullshit laws

[2:41:27] <+DeaconBluesClues> bolt action ends up having big big number
[2:41:28] <%ralphfromdk> ha2ken But it will also punish him way more when he misses a shot
[2:41:30] <ChivesPotato> I flip it for ease of selecting

[2:41:33] <faithless_zealot> Rifle fire speed is garbage

[3:08:18] <CappuccinoGuil> The way I played this game was like: basic attache is for 2 guns. M size is for 3 guns. L size is for 4 guns.
[3:08:18] <Animorphimagi> Red and green herb
[3:08:19] <Judeknight> Rhinox had chain guns
[3:08:20] <%Laecerelius> Smash that robot puss!
[3:08:21] <%Owkono> JUST THROW OUT BULLETS
[3:08:21] <+superkeaton> Rhinox had a fucking chaingun
[3:08:22] <senfood> Black Arachnia's Giant Robot Tits
[3:08:22] <filialpails> literal bolt-ons
[3:08:23] <@SSaryn> what you SHOULD do is dump all your shotgun shit till Riot.

[3:08:34] <Teras_ode> didn't they censor the word "loser" with beeps at some point & that made the shows sound way more raunchy? LUL
[3:08:34] <%StaceMcGate> Rhinox, the only one to NOT get an upgrade

[3:16:58] <%asgard147> Fishie dead limesFeels Why you do this pat? limesPls
[3:16:58] <CappuccinoGuil> To fish you have to go in areas with bugs, so you know what, fuck that noise.
[3:16:59] <+ZephynM> There needs to be competitive fishing where you have to fish with just a knife.
[3:17:01] <%patriotrenegade> That‚Äôs not how you should cut a rope off your leg
[3:17:02] <dabeaminator> I like bass fishing because you're active the whole time, but lake fishing is boring as hell.
[3:17:03] <%Laecerelius> And Leon's leg is super strong
[3:17:03] <%EndlessScrapper> Good to know that the plaga scientist are as capable as Umbrella. "Okay but what if we put the plaga into a salamander? What is we put it in a cricket? What if we put it in a human then force feed it growth hormone?"
[3:17:03] <+Machomanohyeeaa> KKona
[3:17:03] <$RealThiele> dull as sheeeet
[3:17:04] <%SoFarFetched> I've wanted to go fishing for so long.
[3:17:05] <%tiaramaki> And Leon's ankle got rekt to heck
[3:17:05] <Ghost__Pantsu> Fishing sounds like fun then I remember they live in Canada and not Florida lobosLULN
[3:17:06] <%MachineHead9> the sharpest knife
[3:17:07] <MetroidSlayerP7> Fishing is an excuse to drink on a boat
[3:17:08] <OkamiDude15> fishing is rad
[3:17:08] <Neo_Kaiser> Get a long cable and stream fishing
[3:17:09] <Oxybe> pole fishing yes. crab and lobster fishing is for hardcore motherfuckers
[3:17:10] <%natebud> fishing is great
[3:17:11] <SGrim> If your leg was supporting that much weight, it would be immediately ripped from your body.
[3:17:12] <%peachy996> Will you remember to go back twice after this boss fight
[3:17:12] <%Owkono> FISHING IS FOR GETTING DRUNK AND RELAXING
[3:17:14] <%Monkeyweed21> what about the fish seeking wasps Paige?
[3:17:14] <%sirisvirus> bitches love fish
[3:17:15] <StripesUltimateEdition> the upcoming cutscene gave me NIGHTMARES as a kid
[3:17:19] <cheezbass> fishing can get real hype if youre catchin em
[3:17:19] <%Valdorick> I think it would be interesting if he lost his leg. You know, one up Jill getting the T-virus.
[3:17:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> fishing is for rolling down the street, smoking endo, and sippin' on gin and juice.
[3:17:20] <misterspotswood> fishing is only as good as the company thats with you
[3:17:23] <Dame_90> It's boring if you're not the one catching the fish
[3:17:24] <+Lord_of_all_Edges> How many sharknados are active?
[3:17:25] <kerotuyu> Fishing chill, until you catch the fish
[3:17:26] <+LeonPup> big zombo
[3:17:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it's about bondage, I mean bonding.
[3:17:27] <%SoFarFetched> HE HAS AIDS

[3:17:31] <+Arizon1317> A I D S
[3:17:32] <%cvp5127> im shocked pat can survive being surrounded by water
[3:17:33] <Shwepie> Leon's got Lupis.

[3:17:34] <SchroedingersFerret> He has lupus

[3:32:12] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat Start saving the grenades for the house boss fight
[3:32:14] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I guess you could say they had the EVIL WITHIN 2
[3:32:14] <tusk102> @AngriestPat they have the same light sensitivity shit that the leeches do
[3:32:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> in Canadia is Ah-loom-in-um

[3:32:20] <morcego_cinzento_arts> I hate how in RE5 the las plaguas head creatures are not as creepy as those are
[3:32:22] <Neo_Kaiser> Yeah Pat, sell your flash grenades!
[3:32:24] <%EndlessScrapper> You can't attack yet Im in my inventory
[3:32:27] <%Lammchen> Someone should clip Paige saying she‚Äôll go to the eye doctor and ask her about it tomorrow
[3:32:27] <%PatAndPaigeEnabler> nice shot!
[3:32:30] <6mrlube9> UwU
[3:32:30] <%GraceTBM> @XeroSigmaPrime lol
[3:32:31] <IndoorSitup> Man, looking back now, this game was REALLY inspired by The Thing, huh?
[3:32:36] <heemcgee> love that blindingly fast reload animation
[3:32:40] <Neo_Kaiser> Did you guys know that there's a rope climbing animation?
[3:32:42] <+TheGooseChase> i never realized how close the camera is to Leon
[3:32:45] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Scope is shitty
[3:32:46] <cureneckbeard> buy the scoop
[3:32:46] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat Hand Grenade
[3:32:47] <%ThirdWelles> Apologies for coming in super late. What version is this?
[3:32:48] <heemcgee> so fast it looks fucked
[3:32:50] <%Ranger747> @XeroSigmaPrime *turns to camera*
[3:32:50] <%cdrom321> Scope isn't worth it.
[3:32:51] <+LeonPup> spinel on rock
[3:32:52] <%GraceTBM> yeah it wiggles more zoomed in proportionally
[3:32:53] <%natebud> You don't need it
[3:32:53] <Neo_Kaiser> So the boat shortcut up ahead wasn't originally in the game.
[3:32:54] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Dont buy the scope
[3:33:00] <+b_bang_> fair
[3:33:00] <6mrlube9> spinel
[3:33:02] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat to your left
[3:33:05] <Neo_Kaiser> Which explains why most people missed the dog cutscene.
[3:33:07] <ittla> the scope in re4 isnt great and i try to play this game without ever using the sniper
[3:33:09] <6mrlube9> spinel UwU
[3:33:09] <Hellarussian> pat pls
[3:33:10] <Oxybe> Did Elmo end up getting the big sick from yesterday's mud pie post-session? i missed the start of this session so I dunno if they talked about it.
[3:33:12] <+Lord_of_all_Edges> Their subtle movements become a lot more noticeable, zoomed in.
[3:33:15] <%Lammchen> This is pc
[3:33:16] <%Maids4lyfe> apatCrazy
[3:33:18] <+b_bang_> wow
[3:33:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the chat speaks and it becomes reality. WITCH
[3:33:22] <%natebud> Some of you guys are unreal on these loot locations.
[3:33:23] <%StaceMcGate> missed the spinel
[3:33:26] <Fenlig> why aren't you playing the superiors Wii version?
[3:33:28] <Neo_Kaiser> WITCH
[3:33:28] <+ZephynM> That Evil Within 2 joke with O'Neal was hilarious.
[3:33:29] <+PodreySanchezz> Has Pat played Subnautica?
[3:33:29] <ittla> stunlocking regenerators with the knife is Very Difficult
[3:33:35] <heemcgee> Why is just THAT one called a hand grenade, when they all fit perfectly well in your hand?
[3:33:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Zaphire_Saucypants BURN THE HERETICS IN HOLY FIRE!
[3:33:44] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat Spinel on the wall behind you
[3:33:48] <Hellarussian> ok
[3:33:55] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Torches sometimes hide treasure, so remember to cut them
[3:33:58] <Neo_Kaiser> Turn around Pat!
[3:34:01] <%natebud> Flash grenades are just a subgenre of hand grenades
[3:34:02] <%EndlessScrapper> This village that had no working plumbing or electricity had a fully functional dam. Yes I know there were cultures like that who had those but still
[3:34:04] <Shwepie> @Neo_Kaiser Not originally in, as in it was only in the japanese edition? Cause I got it when it came out in the US.
[3:34:05] <6mrlube9> Spinel UwU

[3:34:11] <%Ixiah> imagine the chat was right....
[3:34:11] <%Dementedpenguin> @Oxybe He came back fine
[3:34:12] <+b_bang_> ive played this game 10 years, still learning new things
[3:34:14] <%GraceTBM> stunlocking a regenerator with the knife seems like cutting vegetables on your lap: concievably safe but a very risky business
[3:34:21] <OkamiDude15> i feel pat either streamed subnautica or didnt because he had a fear of the ocean but i dont know which my brain made up sfhTHINK
[3:34:26] <%natebud> He's giggling in the distance
[3:34:26] <%TaphexWin> Probably another hour and a half at most
[3:34:27] <%Ixiah> SALAZAR

[3:35:16] <yhoryn> Hey Pat. How goes babysitter simulator?
[3:35:16] <Dame_90> You did it the let's play I thought? LUL
[3:35:18] <+b_bang_> what a game
[3:35:20] <conflict1914> Pat was the LP just clever trickery? You're acting like you've never played this game
[3:35:21] <%TONYOO101> iirc that was added in later wasn't it?
[3:35:27] <%WhereIsWill> I thought was was a OMEGA PRO at this game tho
[3:35:28] <heemcgee> No he did not do that in the let's play
[3:35:28] <%Aydarkzero> saying "you did it in the lp" is hilarious for some reason
[3:35:31] <%EndlessScrapper> Hes one of those fake gamers who gets by only because of how hot they are
[3:35:31] <%InvisibleMan101> !uptime
[3:35:31] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 35m.
[3:35:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> @okamidude15 He did, but got mind goblins over whether resources respawn. Wasn't cool with finite resources.
[3:35:42] <deviljhojho_> NO NO, we are all getting bamboozled
[3:35:45] <%majima666> pats like the guy who says "I LOVE METALLICA" and wears all the shirts but has only ever heard enter sandman
[3:35:46] <+UnpronounceableName> exposed live on stream
[3:35:46] <KaiserMario> It's not that Pat forgot everything, it's just that there's so much in this game that it's easy to forget
[3:35:47] <deviljhojho_> dont believe his lies
[3:35:48] <yhoryn> You underestimate how much Pat can forget.
[3:35:51] <%Monkeyweed21> BUT YOU DIDNT MISS THEM BEFORE
[3:35:53] <6mrlube9> A cute idiot UwU ;)
[3:35:54] <deviljhojho_> This is artistic
[3:35:55] <Oxybe> @dementedpenguin i know he came bak looking ok, but thy said it could take a bit and pat said he'd watch him for a hit.
[3:35:56] <+PlagueOfGripes> I found an item in Dark Souls yesterday I never knew existed
[3:35:57] <+JFrostyBeats> There a ring by the waterfall.
[3:35:59] <Shwepie> I don't get it.

[3:36:04] <+Arizon1317> ok boomer
[3:36:06] <%WackyXmand> Hey Pat, just do what Max did and call this a lore run.
[3:36:08] <dabeaminator> I'm sure the comments on the old videos were similar, he's just getting the feedback live now.
[3:36:09] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @doc_ock_rokc We are Pat's stand....that is depressing
[3:36:11] <Dame_90> True
[3:36:12] <%maskofmichael> Pat, did you know that Paige is right next to you?
[3:36:12] <%natebud> It's the ideal scenario, wait long enough that you forget just enough about the game that parts of it seem new
[3:36:14] <%luftraumm1> vinny is replaying chrono trigger and keeps running into this issue with an earlier lp
[3:36:14] <SaltyDongs> when is safety dance gonna start playing though

[3:37:35] <+professormorrigan> I like the giant Salazar statue Kappa
[3:37:38] <%natebud> It's not the drop in quality that Village > Ship was in RE5
[3:37:40] <%GraceTBM> my castle is definitely MY longest part
[3:37:40] <IndoorSitup> I still prefer the Village over all of them
[3:37:41] <%EndlessScrapper> Theres a note later in the game saying they are worried Leon will kill the whole village before he turns. There was what...under a dozen houses in total in the village? How many are there?
[3:37:43] <%luftraumm1> 5/1 male to female ratio is a hard fit
[3:37:43] <%Dementedpenguin> @yhoryn I first played it in 2016. The controls might need some getting used to at first, but it's a really solid game
[3:37:45] <heemcgee> castle cool i like castle
[3:37:45] <Oxybe> @angriestpat Did Elmo end up getting the big sick from yesterday's mud pie post-session? i missed the start of this session so I dunno if they talked about it

[3:37:58] <Lostpoptart> Wait what about the rope
[3:38:04] <%majima666> i only find 2 things in this game to be creepy/scary and thats the regenerators and church cultists
[3:38:05] <%ThirdWelles> Are you running any mods on this, or is it just vanilla-ass Steam version?
[3:38:08] <Hellarussian> does Hunnigan exist past this game?

[3:39:16] <%maskofmichael> Stop being blind
[3:39:18] <%GraceTBM> God, I really wanted to play this through on Professional for a replay, but I didn't have a save and this game is finicky with save replacements

[3:41:26] <Dame_90> Somersault that bish
[3:41:26] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Ranger747 Fun fact, the running you hear in the sewer is a left over sound from a removed scene. In some verisons of the game, you can go out of bounds to trigger a scene where youre in the perspective of a Novistador running though the sewers, a reference to the Hunter scene in REmake. The audio was never removed tho and still plays at the location of the original trigger
[3:41:27] <%ThirdWelles> Leon is such a fucking badass after RE2

[3:56:26] <Hellarussian> this is a DBZ level of exposition
[3:56:26] <%Shadicara> Aliens
[3:56:27] <MyNameIsRasus> Why would he tell them that
[3:56:28] <%peachy996> Leon makes Billy look like Steve Burnside
[3:56:29] <%RealThiele> nuns with guns
[3:56:30] <%TalisKanju> this guy is so ridiculous
[3:56:30] <ittla> saddler should've just went with infinite tsukuyomi
[3:56:33] <SpartanDumpster> I was wondering what happened to Ashley during 6. Sucks she wants to bone the guy who shot her dad.
[3:56:34] <daemos123> this is so goddamn cheesy how did i ever take this seriously
[3:56:34] <%Dr_Mooose> oh shit they got crossbows
[3:56:35] <+boondoggle42> Just hold up your light saber until he blows himself up.
[3:56:38] <MenstrualMunchies> Whoa Leon, you can't call them aliens anymore.
[3:56:38] <oniwahoo> He could always have multiple terms that just are not consecutive, y'all
[3:56:39] <%Valdorick> Okay, but... WHY DO THEY HAVE CROSSBOWS!?
[3:56:40] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @angriestpat he

[3:56:43] <%Breaknoon> PANTSU
[3:56:43] <%Aydarkzero> dying makes the process faster
[3:56:45] <%SvenHolgersson> He can be dead for that
[3:56:45] <%MachineHead9> maybe he had only 1 term and took a break
[3:56:46] <%Shadicara> Bio Aliens
[3:56:47] <%takokasa> Only MOSTLY kill him
[3:56:47] <%tigerfang86> BUT ALSO KILL HIM
[3:56:47] <%RealThiele> why not have crossbows
[3:56:49] <+ChiefWilly> Thats not how that works Leon
[3:56:50] <%natebud> Think of the zombie thing as a backup plan @AngriestPat
[3:56:50] <xxshadowxx416> why are you tell me this
[3:56:51] <%Laecerelius> Murder the crux of all of our plans!
[3:56:52] <%Jjrossman> man she wants to fuck him so bad
[3:56:53] <+its_a_mimic> they were stun crossbows
[3:56:53] <%Valdorick> Does notspain not have GUNS!?
[3:56:54] <+rdark_ksu> why does she have a babies sweater on her back?
[3:56:55] <%Taisuru> Ashley's dad is not the president from RE6
[3:56:55] <%ThirdWelles> I mean, not killing him allows him to kill everyone else
[3:56:56] <Lostpoptart> This is like naruto with less bs
[3:56:58] <%WhereIsWill> KILL Him.... slightly
[3:56:58] <dabeaminator> That's not how messes work Leon
[3:56:59] <%Breaknoon> MOAR PANTSU PLS
[3:57:00] <%moogleboy1984> "we infested the president's daughter so she can spread our religion. Kill them!!"

[3:57:03] <%TalisKanju> Don't worry Ashley, I'M COMIN' FOR YA
[3:57:05] <yourliteraldog> Pantsu
[3:57:06] <%ha2ken> Leon must be leveled up before they bring him over.
[3:57:06] <Djinnazz> @AngriestPat That's Not Ashley's Dad you shoot.
[3:57:06] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat Ready for the house boss fountain?
[3:57:08] <%D3rrtyD4n> ok its not her dad thats killed
[3:57:09] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @angriestpat Ashley's dad would've finished his 2 terms by 6
[3:57:10] <Mannyefaces> go back in the church
[3:57:13] <%zamzoph> So what does kidnapping the president's daughter have to do with all of this?
[3:57:15] <%RealThiele> chaotic evil society in action
[3:57:15] <%MachineHead9> D:

[4:14:26] <%Dragon_Batman> Gaiden black 2
[4:14:27] <%Mr_Strut> No bra
[4:14:29] <%goose_attack_almanac> No bra apparently.
[4:14:29] <%GraceTBM> the real stuff is so much more engaging than videogame jiggle
[4:14:29] <filialpails> what if you quickly spin back and forth around the yaw axis? that would make them bounce like that
[4:14:30] <SaltyDongs> I have not
[4:14:32] <%TaphexWin> Only differences I'm seeing between the PS2 version and the GC version of RE4 is that the GC version runs/sounds better, but the PS2 version has the extra costumes and the 2 Ada extra scenarios.

[4:14:55] <%SvenHolgersson> DID SOMEBODY SAY BIG TIDDY GOTH GF
[4:14:56] <%Estuko> Boob bouncing is great, but it goes from sexy to comedic/hilarious, prefer them all natural instead of super antigravity. Swing low sweet chariots
[4:14:57] <%Niney_Who> Europe has Airborne Viruses that increase Titty-size of American Girls
