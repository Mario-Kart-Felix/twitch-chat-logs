[0:06:54] <%alcors_wisdom> for fighting games i feel like pat is better at base but woolie has more potential
[0:06:56] <+b_aleph> Pat into fighting games
[0:06:58] <%Nekros4442> Dat blood meter
[0:06:59] <%BestTeaMaker> saturday night scrublords lives

[0:07:30] <%Nekros4442> Yeah Nago has problems
[0:07:37] <%Nekros4442> Blood Mode is not a boon
[0:07:37] <SunsetJack> Wow, that explosion wave did not reach.
[0:07:41] <smiggyballs13> 2-0
[0:07:42] <LorcaNomad> @DublinRage YES
[0:07:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Nago fights the blood meter as much as the opponent sadly
[0:07:58] <%GarbageNirvana> What's that dril tweet again
[0:08:00] <Alexandrummer> Dem sprites tho
[0:08:03] <%Taisuru> Blood mode will definitely see changes before full release I think
[0:08:10] <%fakeburg> Woolie kept getting smoked by the problem psaWhat
[0:08:13] <%GarbageNirvana> As the smoke clears my dead body is on the ground
[0:08:14] <Profmcstevie> You can't pop blood away from your opponent, it's better to just ZOOM IN and try and hit them with the burst
[0:08:15] <$Emperor_Machinus> @DublinRage It's can't be friday night Fisti cuffs, that is only on Saturdays
[0:08:19] <reonome> we need a mic on woolie
[0:08:20] <Captain_Joe1911> Go Pat! heart2Fighting tansy5Cheer
[0:08:21] <+Stunstark> Wait I thought Pat didn't know how to play FGs
[0:08:23] <super_robo_mg> was that character made just for woolie?
[0:08:28] <%SaiyanShoto> I have still yet to fight a Nago online surprisingly
[0:08:30] <Zbyrd0961> that throw is not ok
[0:08:32] <+The_Review_Corps> Keep touching your nose @patstaresat
[0:08:33] <+black_pariah> god i want to hear woolie's salt
[0:08:35] <+SoySocks> forge woolie's nago in the flames of pot
[0:08:43] <LorcaNomad> nago was literally made for wollie it's kinda silly
[0:08:46] <%SomersaultJustice> oh it's woolie
[0:08:46] <marvel877> Don't touch your nose.
[0:08:47] <$SGrim> Potemkin is finally a scary as he should have always been. PogChamp
[0:08:48] <%GarbageNirvana> Okay here it is
[0:08:51] <DublinRage> @emperor_machinus dammit you're right LUL
[0:08:52] <theanora1> Woolie is getting bodied
[0:08:53] <%GarbageNirvana> So blood mode is basically "so long suckers! i rev up my motorcylce and create a huge cloud of smoke. when the cloud dissipates im lying completely dead on the pavement"
[0:08:55] <@SoFarFetched> @Emperor_Machinus Saturday was Saturday Morning Scrublords Kappa

[0:10:25] <@SoFarFetched> @Emperor_Machinus oh you missed my second part where I said "we're a day early for scrublords" LUL
[0:10:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> First time they've done something together since RE2 Remake
[0:10:42] <DublinRage> Is the only reason this isn't a Fisticuffs because Woolie can't play a boss character?
[0:10:46] <@SoFarFetched> But man I don't remember the last fisticuffs/scrublords I saw

[0:12:14] <+Katohearts> Did he throw out a mini Nago?
[0:12:27] <DublinRage> @queequegtheater every XIII game

[0:13:06] <zachneely1119> pat would you say nago is bad or just really hard too use
[0:13:09] <aura_00> what room is pat in?
[0:13:09] <%AncelDeLambert> that's because Woolie is insane
[0:13:14] <triggersqueeze1985> Well done Patrick
[0:13:18] <+Personified134> @QueequegTheater Probably FF2, the rest I don't think there are any worth straight up avoiding
[0:13:25] <DublinRage> @PatStaresAt does it feel nostalgic?
[0:13:26] <aura_00> park i mean
[0:13:29] <%HitchhikingThrough> That bit from the sonic OVA with metal sonic but for real

[0:13:36] <Profmcstevie> Ah, this familiar Woolie flavour....
[0:13:39] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah he's in here.
[0:13:41] <%alcors_wisdom> anime rivals
[0:13:43] <%ClericOfSparda> It's more of a mental match with Woolie
[0:13:50] <VinegarPie> Nago seems too high risk imo
[0:13:52] <%AncelDeLambert> Woolie, teach me how to dougie
[0:13:55] <$RealThiele> i need to salty bet now so bad
[0:13:56] <%KeiganOfAstora> No

[0:14:05] <+Pandarancher> Woolie is in the chat stealing piees
[0:14:08] <Maverick2736> Nago is pretty good, just tricky to do real hype shit with
[0:14:14] <%FacetiousAF> woolie if you're in here teabag when you get the chance
[0:14:19] <$RealThiele> g u n
[0:14:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> What's woolie's username here if he's not WoolieVersus or CastleSuperBeast?

[0:14:44] <%Emperor_Machinus> @PeachSaliva Hey Peach!
[0:14:45] <%Ranryu692> I'm firmly rooting for Woolie in this

[0:15:12] <$SGrim> 3-1
[0:15:13] <%wibbwobbler> gotta make him work heck yes
[0:15:13] <Solidnick18> ooh unsafe
[0:15:14] <gunstars20> Ye

[0:15:18] <%SoftLusca> psaGib tfpodCopvan This looks so cool
[0:15:19] <Dr_Mooose> oof
[0:15:19] <Maverick2736> yep
[0:15:21] <%alcors_wisdom> fucking every time
[0:15:21] <+eanscrale> win is a win
[0:15:24] <%KeiganOfAstora> So you won?
[0:15:24] <%ClericOfSparda> It's a risky maneuver, for sure
[0:15:28] <$RealThiele> blood burst is suicide
[0:15:29] <rosencruez> 3-1
[0:15:30] <LorcaNomad> yeah that activation is so laggy
[0:15:32] <smiggyballs13> Sooooo long
[0:15:33] <%Taisuru> Man I thought woolie liked fighting games Kappa
[0:15:33] <Saltmeisterr> Hullo gamer
[0:15:33] <marvel877> Why does he keep trying that?
[0:15:34] <David_de_Bergerac> where we at homies
[0:15:34] <Profmcstevie> That's what HE GETS FOR SPECIAL CANCELLING TOO MUCH
[0:15:34] <%BudaBryan> what floor are they on?
[0:15:37] <Freyja_Wion> how is pat better lol
[0:15:39] <%YakumoYomi> I'm really not sure how his Bloodrage is supposed to work. Maybe on a hard knockdown?
[0:15:40] <+JustToWatch> I have a hunch Nago is gonna get buffed for release
[0:15:44] <Saltmeisterr> oh SHIT its woolie
[0:15:45] <+Pandarancher> What kind of alternate universe are we living in
[0:15:47] <%Nekros4442> It's not something they do by choice guys. If the blood meter gets filled he automatically activates
[0:15:49] <%QueequegTheater> This looks like the coolest game I will never touch this year
[0:15:50] <marvel877> Just tries going in raw and fails.
[0:15:58] <winner_92> wait its the real woolie versus
[0:15:58] <Sol_Install> i mean special canceling as much he does it
[0:16:00] <%Nekros4442> The blood meter goes up whenever Nago uses specials and that dash in
[0:16:01] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[0:16:03] <Daxalog> Do they?
[0:16:03] <Solidnick18> yeah
[0:16:03] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Nice
[0:16:05] <%TheFramedWarlock> Bloodrage does a hit and blows you away iirc
[0:16:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> Pat's beating Woolie at a fighting game wtf
[0:16:08] <%ClericOfSparda> They need to do something about that huge window
[0:16:10] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt THEY GOT DMCA'ED ON THEIR OWN SONG TODAY
[0:16:10] <%valriot> LUL That shit was bad, and I like old Metallica
[0:16:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> Metallica is alright
[0:16:11] <$RealThiele> oh god that blizzcon concert was cringe
[0:16:14] <%KeiganOfAstora> They used to be great
[0:16:15] <rosencruez> yeah fuck metallica
[0:16:17] <Sol_Install> the dash in is a speical
[0:16:18] <David_de_Bergerac> where we dropping, gamers I literally just want a nice room to play in
[0:16:24] <%krispen_wa> ARMOR CLAD IN FAIIIIIITH
[0:16:27] <+Personified134> I love metallica, but fuck metallica
[0:16:29] <%TheFramedWarlock> There's a combo from bloodrage that ToDs chipp but if you screw up you die
[0:16:34] <Maverick2736> They used to not suck... until they started sucking like most other famous classic metal bands
[0:16:41] <%sakeydo> woolie loses in suicide can he come back?
[0:16:42] <huskarl_zap> IM A CLOWN OF FAITH
[0:16:45] <huskarl_zap> fate
[0:16:46] <LorcaNomad> apparently it's their fault that music copyright sucks now?
[0:16:50] <Calek> no back dashes only forward
[0:16:52] <Jodoxk1> last time I listened to metallica they went from being a rock band to a country music band
[0:16:53] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, this is the only genre in which you become Paige
[0:16:53] <$RealThiele> b e agressive
[0:16:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> What "is" Potempkin? His upper body proportions are not human lol
[0:16:56] <Sol_Install> yes
[0:16:59] <%AncelDeLambert> you rely on face-fucking
[0:17:02] <%QueequegTheater> Pat that's why you're not a very good grappler
[0:17:04] <%Ranryu692> none of this makes any sense to me
[0:17:06] <+NWR_James> THE COME BACK
[0:17:09] <+eanscrale> Pot has the best backdash in the game though
[0:17:13] <%AncelDeLambert> @KeiganOfAstora some kind of robot
[0:17:14] <$RealThiele> good match

[0:36:01] <%JoshManVGH> Pat recovered the momentum. But Woolie isn't out yet.
[0:36:02] <%HitchhikingThrough> Is blood rage a debuff?
[0:36:03] <Zombrocom> Bloodrage is so brutal, poor woolie

[0:36:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @wolfen091 he can't get the setup going as quickly
[0:36:28] <Solidus_113> the throw demoralizes
[0:36:29] <smiggyballs13> Pat still giving Woolz respect all the while
[0:36:29] <HeavyC4> woolie did pick top tier but pat still beating his ass up

[0:52:06] <Dutchpotato> Nice matchmaking btw
[0:52:08] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I'm going to start playing through every numbered FF game in order because I don't have enough timesinks in my life, which ones should I ABSOLUTELY skip?
[0:52:11] <%GingaNZ> pots voice actor deserves a payraise for these busters
[0:52:18] <%HitchhikingThrough> Nope, we're waiting for match making
[0:52:26] <%krispen_wa> skip 2
[0:52:27] <+Personified134> @DudeDern You can literally see and hear his stick in the camera
[0:52:32] <%krispen_wa> and 13
[0:52:36] <Smitteys867> Can you do hammer fall after AA grab RC?
[0:52:51] <%barkon345> @QueequegTheater definatley skip 2
[0:52:54] <deviljhojho_> Yeah just skip 2
[0:52:56] <JayEarly> potemkin loves to bust
[0:52:58] <deviljhojho_> it aint worth it
[0:52:59] <$ggbhtg> MajinObama said there's still stagger stuns in this game, just secretly. that is wack.
[0:53:04] <%senorpapel> @queequegtheater 8, 13, 1,2, 15
[0:53:07] <NewJerseyTV> Maybe one day we'll find a match
[0:53:09] <+JohnXuandou> that was slidehead Pat
[0:53:17] <%krispen_wa> legendary bussy MajinObama?
[0:53:19] <+JohnXuandou> Hammerfall is the dashy punchy
[0:53:42] <+JohnXuandou> if you do FAST RC you don't need to charge
[0:53:50] <%krispen_wa> dont skip 8,it has triple triad
[0:54:02] <%Roasted_Pheasant> GOD THIS OST IS SO GOOD
[0:54:11] <Saltmeisterr> OHh hey Buttons
[0:54:16] <%senorpapel> If you want triple triad you can just free download 14
[0:54:18] <%GarbageNirvana> Just how many pile bunkers does Potemkin have on his arms now exactly?
[0:54:18] <smiggyballs13> I got reunited with my copy of Pokemon Heart Gold. I’m the happiest boy in the world!
[0:54:24] <%barkon345> yea 8 has some major flaws and oddities but it is still worth playing
[0:54:25] <watchdv> @patstaresat dash before your rc for fast rc (blue)
[0:54:28] <Zombrocom> Direction + reset
[0:54:32] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Why is bussy so good?
[0:54:33] <%DedlokPM> @krispen_wa Skip 8, play triple triad in ff14
[0:54:40] <%senorpapel> @smiggyballs13 a joyous reunion. Game is so good
[0:54:43] <%Rumbutt> The position reset seems to want to put itself on right for some reason
[0:54:43] <+JohnXuandou> no that's the drift RC
[0:54:47] <watchdv> Bussyman too good
[0:54:51] <+JohnXuandou> that one just lets you move during RC
[0:54:52] <TigerClaws12> blue is xrd's yellow
[0:54:54] <Zombrocom> Drriiifffttt
[0:55:01] <+JohnXuandou> fast RC is cancelling the burst of RC
[0:55:04] <%SvenHolgersson> Its a way to keep close to the enemy
[0:55:12] <%SomersaultJustice> why has your quick match not found anyone yet
[0:55:12] <smiggyballs13> @senorpapel I lost it 8 years ago and my mom found it outta nowhere, can you believe it?
[0:55:12] <KenOniichan> blue can used for whiff punishing
[0:55:16] <Zombrocom> Blue RC is for getting in, slows down your opponent making it harder for them to contest you
[0:55:18] <Profmcstevie> Is Blue RC 4 way or 8 way
[0:55:27] <JayEarly> blue rc can slow your enemy down
[0:55:28] <Zombrocom> RC is 4 way
[0:55:34] <nepwar> the quickest match find on twitch
[0:55:40] <%senorpapel> It means you were destined to play it this year @smiggyballs13
[0:55:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> pat are you waiting for a match or not
[0:55:59] <KenOniichan> quick match is "busted" cuz it still put you on a lobby and people still need to walk up to you @PatStaresAt
[0:56:02] <smiggyballs13> @senorpapel 2021 can’t be all bad!
[0:56:03] <Garrison27> You can get a ghetto ass airdash off of blue rc if you do some black magic bullshit
