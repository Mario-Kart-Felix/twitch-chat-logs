[0:35:19] <%JoshManVGH> Damn, those meds are paying dividends!
[0:35:19] <%Dakuu75> She probably cheats and somehow CHOOSES how bad her eyes are
[0:35:19] <@TheYellowcouch> That's what the universe needs
[0:35:20] <%SaiyanShoto> Even a blind squirrel finds a nut every now and then
[0:35:23] <bob900000> she is very smart
[0:35:23] <@ssjklyco> And yet can't not lose her glasses
[0:35:24] <%crimsonharvest> paige got that ND brain we have weird abilities

[0:35:26] <%hrbeck_> SHE CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS
[0:35:27] <SocialMisfitGamer> @PeachSaliva You're still blind, Paige

[0:35:37] <spongeofmystery> She can't keep getting away with this
[0:35:37] <%NateyBeak> well yea she is basically a hospital at this point
[0:35:37] <%cvp5127> dont worry paige cant read chat
[0:35:38] <%DeaconBluesClues> @patstaresat I strongly suggest getting the glasses that dim/turn into sunglasses when exposed to sunlight
[0:35:41] <%sakeydo> Let true old age begin!
[0:35:42] <%Mr_Pylon> She traded the break everything flaw for perfect eye prediction perk.
[0:35:44] <oozebear> I wanna see what Paige's Disco Elysium skill cabinet is like, that shit must be so busted
[0:35:45] <scrumbotime> Paige has the Sight Beyond Sight, at the cost of......... Sight.
[0:35:47] <%maskofmichael> Lupus has some random buffs and nerfs
[0:35:49] <Profmcstevie> She's gonna sit on her glasses within a week
[0:35:49] <@Lion_kun> Just give her surgery, she can't lose her eyes.
[0:35:50] <%megadblitz> paige didnt spec enough into vision but did spec into paige points
[0:35:51] <%SaiyanShoto> She still shouldn't do that though LUL
[0:35:53] <i_chevalier> @patstaresat We know she is running a Lucky Ted build.
[0:35:54] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt But does this means her eyesight has been getting slightly worse over time
[0:35:56] <%laserbeaming> is Eli sending you Horse Paste?
[0:35:56] <%JoshManVGH> So how many pairs of backup glasses will be required for the both of you?
[0:35:57] <roboyuji> I've got an appointment for eyes next weekend, after years of not going

[0:36:26] <%Kemmybelle> @patstaresat get a copy of your prescription so you can order cheaper frames from zenni or clearly contacts.
[0:36:29] <KaiserMario> This happens often
[0:36:32] <+ThomasOfTroy> That first doctor was probably an idiot, yeah
[0:36:32] <%X2Eliah> @PatStaresAt for real get glasses that turn dark in sunlight
[0:36:35] <StarlitStunner> My Brand

[0:48:49] <%Cerabret100> @PeachSaliva its super easy and slow to start, you'll do great
[0:48:50] <@PeachSaliva> @Kain5707 yep yep! tomorrow @ 9PM EST

[0:49:12] <+Zeplin666> kim every day
[0:49:14] <%SveriSageAdvice> @PeachSaliva 14 is actually super forgiving early on and is a slower pace than most MMOs, dont worry too much about it and the community is generally super friendly to new players
[0:49:16] <jorkoal> definetely Kim
[0:49:17] <WebmanJax> I really hope chat is cool for Peige's 14 stream. I'd hate if we ruin it for her like that WoW guy.
[0:49:17] <%holydeviant1> KIM
[0:49:17] <Blank9> kim
[0:49:17] <Dr_Mooose> but Kim

[0:49:21] <+wmeldrum> but my kimbo bimbo
[0:49:21] <%crimsonharvest> I dont have enough psychosis to wear Kim down
[0:49:21] <%okuriskyles> garrus is kind of less of a cop, but that also makes him scarier to hang with
[0:49:22] <%cooldude69xx> I feel like Garrus is more likely to leave bodies behind
[0:49:23] <%Bailey__gaming> @peachsaliva u picked a class yet?
[0:49:24] <%SirGO0SE> kim
[0:49:26] <%CatRidder> kim

[0:49:32] <xeros720> i think garrus is better at hunting/fishing
[0:49:35] <scrumbotime> I wish I could feel like my head is small
[0:49:38] <@PeachSaliva> @DianaTheAscian hmmm good to know, thank you dear
[0:49:40] <%AncelDeLambert> I was to understand that the 14 crowd were chill, I don't think sub-only is necessary
[0:49:40] <KaneCube> @peachsaliva I played a few hours of FF14. Only MMO I've played, I liked it, just don't have the time to sink into it :/
[0:49:42] <%SirGO0SE> i wanna talk about weird alien stuff with kim

[0:51:17] <%CatRidder> at least the beta
[0:51:23] <%Faustgesicht> @cooldude69xx Gotcha. Best of luck, hope you're okay
[0:51:29] <%Cerabret100> BG1 I tried but it started feeling like a slog, hear 2 is so good i might go back and stick it out
[0:51:31] <draca23> Baldurs Gate 2 was so boring...Irenicus was the worst thing ever.
[0:51:37] <Profmcstevie> A battle for the crown
[0:51:37] <%okuriskyles> there's literally a baldur's gate 3 made by larian
[0:51:50] <%Puhff> But none of those games are in Faerun
[0:51:52] <+Calek> BG3 is getting better, some of the earlier design choices are getting smoothed out
[0:51:55] <%arcaderabbit48> Baldur's Gate was... dull. And unwieldy
[0:51:56] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt  Pathfinder is super good. Your mind goblins will make it bad too Stream

[0:53:52] <+Calek> and people are friendly in match making content, let them know it's your first time in a dungeon or whatever and it should be chill
[0:53:52] <%Cerabret100> I make it a point to say nothing. to send a message
[0:53:53] <%Ynkubus_> I just say its my first time on first runs
[0:53:53] <%cooldude69xx> Yeah, just quit it
[0:53:54] <%GalacticaPhanto> And that's how I became a mediocre healer
[0:53:55] <%DianaTheAscian> I don't do them ether cause I'm not good and people scary
[0:53:56] <nilla_24> just a hello or laliho
[0:53:58] <%Kaask> treat it like ripping off a bandage. just do it and get it over with.

[0:54:03] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> I say "Ello/" and thats it
[0:54:06] <%RyTYoung> that's me, but it's hard to type on ps5 duee to the keyboard on controller
[0:54:07] <%Bailey__gaming> I always say if it's 1st time to a duty
[0:54:08] <Latija> that's just not true
[0:54:09] <notsoy> i used to be like that when i was playing wow but i learned that i was way overrating those issues
[0:54:09] <%crimsonharvest> i'll say this they're more likely to say something nice than a wow queue
[0:54:09] <@Jekado> oh queuing with randos in duties...
[0:54:10] <WebmanJax> I say "Hello" when I load in, and "GG" before I leave. And that's it.
[0:54:11] <Blank9> just a yo or \o
[0:54:11] <%RealThiele> (Hello!)
[0:54:12] <%Puhff> Just pull half the dungeon and remain silent
[0:54:14] <T_Sasquatch> just do it you pussy
[0:54:14] <%hrbeck_> people think more about what other will think of them than think about others

[0:57:04] <+Alopekis> Elden Ring isn't real. It's a figment of our imaginations.
[0:57:04] <Profmcstevie> Sony has a small selection of studios left who make games, there isn't much room for surprise
[0:57:06] <%SaiyanShoto> My only negative with Elden Ring right now is the visuals but oh well
[0:57:09] <@MistyMntns> What did I miss?
[0:57:11] <i_chevalier> @patstaresat How many days of no Bayonetta news?

[1:07:43] <$lotharrio> I just thought of a fun thing, where you play a survival horror game, but you don't have a weapon that kills enemies permanently. Instead what you have are locks you can slap on doors to hold enemies inside.
[1:07:44] <%HypnospaceHyena> Don't let the shadows embrace you. Tell them to respect your personal space.
[1:07:45] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Don't stare to long
[1:07:46] <%SpoonheadInExile> It means call HR on them there shadows

[1:16:01] <Boegame> big paige doing big noise
[1:16:07] <+MisterAvry> it's funny because I can't hear her respond
[1:16:07] <StarlitStunner> Paige boosting the ambiance
[1:16:08] <$lotharrio> Doesn't she still need new glasses?
[1:16:15] <DanThePumpkinman> spooky
[1:16:16] <%jinking79> another insurance
[1:16:16] <KaneCube> that's super wrong
[1:16:17] <%TungstenViper> YES
[1:16:18] <katzroy56> it's her stand
[1:16:18] <HotMafia81> Damn her shadow is fucking nuts
[1:16:19] <@Ranryu692> bug or spooky?
[1:16:20] <%strakillias> When does Paige the glasses?
[1:16:20] <@Jekado> ITS A GHOST
[1:16:20] <1matheuw> umm
[1:16:20] <%AncelDeLambert> it's not wavering enough
[1:16:22] <@Jekado> or stand?
[1:16:24] <%AzureGale> It's definitely how shadows work
[1:16:25] <+haitakaa> it's your stand
[1:16:26] <LunarRemix> It looks attached to her model?
[1:16:26] <%AncelDeLambert> and it's not dark enough in the shadow
[1:16:26] <%DianaTheAscian> OH NO DUTCH ANGLES
[1:16:27] <%RealThiele> ass shadow
[1:16:27] <@Jekado> maybe she has a stand ability?
[1:16:27] <%cooldude69xx> The arm?
[1:16:27] <+condemned_15> Is that some Shaman King summon?
[1:16:27] <%Caped_Eggy> The closer the light is the bigger the shadow is
[1:16:28] <%Tman451> RTX ON
[1:16:30] <scrumbotime> it does when you have the Yamato Blade
[1:16:31] <%hrbeck_> yeah, that's a glitch
[1:16:31] <ShiningAxis> it's just the upper torso
[1:16:32] <BliVru> @patstaresat When will we see Patestaresat Doolhouse?
[1:16:32] <1matheuw> maybe its intensional?
[1:16:32] <%AzureGale> definitely not*
[1:16:32] <%FunkyStreams> it should be that obtuse, but its weird
[1:16:32] <DanThePumpkinman> its correct for spookiness
[1:16:33] <%valriot> Thats wrong LUL
[1:16:34] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> pat you're nitpicking
[1:16:35] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> That is very wrong
[1:16:35] <%Bailey__gaming> Shadow man
[1:16:36] <%hrbeck_> hopefully
[1:16:36] <%MisterRockett> The arm is DEF weird
[1:16:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its fiiiiiìiiiiiiine
[1:16:36] <%ComfortableStranger> did you remind her NOT to drink pineapple juice today? there's a strong possibility she has already forgotten
[1:16:39] <%NitronStreams> its to sharp to be cast by the tiny lighter
[1:16:41] <@Ranryu692> it seems like it's just her torso coming out of her feet
[1:16:42] <Guilgameshx> looks like she has a stand
[1:16:42] <%asgard147> ...unless that's not her shadow limesS
[1:16:43] <@Ranryu692> looks like a stand
[1:16:44] <LunarRemix> Like it's a second model that's just attached to her
[1:16:45] <ExpressNode> A design thing?
[1:16:46] <HotMafia81> They used a point light (omnidirectional) for her flashlight, instead of a spotlight @PatStaresAt
[1:16:47] <GillamonsterZ> it's a stand
[1:16:47] <+KaguraRaion> @lotharrio You missed earlier when pat talked about how they are both going soon to get some
[1:16:47] <rufus2k2> her hips are outta control tho damn
[1:16:51] <heart_ablaze> it looks cool tho
[1:16:52] <Boegame> its because they just placed a point light in the lighter, so it looks terrible
[1:16:56] <%HypnospaceHyena> And it's only a shadow of your torso and up. So it's made for optimum embracing
[1:16:58] <@SoFarFetched> WILLEM DAFOE?
[1:17:00] <%AncelDeLambert> her shadow should be wavering all over the place since it's a flame casting the light
[1:17:00] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> There's no falloff on her shadow.
[1:17:02] <2pac_2furious> god they could do the COOLEST scare with this dumb lighter system
[1:17:02] <+haitakaa> your hand should not be infront of you LUL

[1:25:51] <+hyren21> some of these voice lines sound like they were recorded completely out of context of each other. like sentence to sentence they don't sound like part of the same conversation
[1:25:51] <%holydeviant1> Remember, folks, nail guns in real life have a safety mechanism so they must be pressed against something to fire - but they're still super dangerous!
[1:25:57] <%anAngryHamster> My dick split open, and locusts flew out!
[1:25:58] <$lotharrio> More than enough to kill any man alive.
[1:26:04] <%Starotter70> So no lighter and gun at the same time?

[1:46:29] <+Alopekis> This is the Dark Souls of games named Tormented Souls.
[1:46:30] <%Bailey__gaming> @patstaresat is there a heartbin that medical dummy
[1:46:33] <+AutechreTwinAphex> the graphics are kinda good for such a small indie dev
[1:46:34] <%DeaconBluesClues> this game is NOT FUCKIN AROUND
[1:46:35] <Enn19> But what if it's....THE HEART?
[1:46:35] <DJMesoPhunk> yeah the beginning of this before you get used to it is rough

[1:46:50] <%anAngryHamster> Pat has forgotten what the classic RE experience was like
[1:47:00] <%Dakuu75> I hope it's a cow heart or something not human
[1:47:00] <%Cerabret100> I've heard this game is actually kinda hard
[1:47:03] <+Kangumosa> Good ol’ classic style vidya
[1:47:04] <Kriss1827> seems like it
[1:47:09] <%DeaconBluesClues> @patstaresat you died horribly and had no check points, just like your Japanese survival horrors!
[1:47:10] <zerointelligence000> aside from the voice acting this seems less jank than I expected
[1:47:11] <BinaryBetrayer> Is this Haunting Grounds/Rule of Rose rolled up together?

[1:49:20] <DJMesoPhunk> I heard it was Czech developers

[1:50:40] <Jontman42> what the fuck feet
[1:50:40] <+Alopekis> Sometimes legless people with knives on their hands just crawl at you in Canada. It's just something you have to deal with.
[1:50:40] <%Axellogic> HE SHOWED FEET
[1:50:42] <KaneCube> where's the fishnets, pat?

[1:50:55] <BigFingerRo> WHIP EM OUT EVERYBODY
[1:51:05] <djblue_shift> These Dutch angles are outta control
[1:51:05] <%FunkyStreams> TEEF
[1:51:05] <%shurtal> it's not montreal survival horror unless one of the enemies is just the IDEA of construction work
[1:51:06] <SunsetJack> Covid made construction work in Montreal worst...
[1:51:08] <+ThomasOfTroy> @ThomasOfTroy Bonk me harder uwu
[1:51:09] <%Treasure_Vault> Pat is a Human, the species that has historically committed ALL murder ever.

[1:51:34] <BigFingerRo> @FunkyStreams Teeth? Huh, that's unusual, but hey, you do you
[1:51:35] <%Axellogic> The fuck is the corpse holding
[1:51:35] <+Alopekis> Those video game noises were super spooky
[1:51:38] <+GuilKato> was the lamp doing morse code?
[1:51:41] <Jetsfantasy> @BinaryBetrayer I'm sorry you had to learn this way LUL
[1:51:46] <luckyifpurple> You need to remember having one eye limits your FOV when aiming
[1:51:49] <+Alopekis> @dd44dostivei It's legitimately a game, if that's what you're asking.
[1:51:52] <%RigmaroleHM> Gief could be a zombie VA
[1:51:52] <Carquar> It does look pretty legit. Not sure if it's too legit to quit yet though
[1:51:52] <Maids4lyfe> I literally cannot hear dog, I only hear game

[1:52:01] <@Spydurman> Zangief could fill folders of survival horror sound files
[1:52:05] <+ThomasOfTroy> @Treasure_Vault Nah man, lots of animals have murder each other. Hippos will just randomly trample infants to death for funsies
[1:52:07] <TheLocalRival> Is there Gief DLC?
[1:52:12] <BobbsonDugnutt> ! BLOOD LOSS !
[1:52:12] <KaneCube> When will Gief noises be used in Audio Foley shenanigans
[1:52:15] <+RandyFistburgers> Gief is a foley artist
[1:52:23] <+Alopekis> @Kangumosa There was that one giraffe.
[1:52:24] <@Ranryu692> did it just shoot blood out of its forehead?
[1:52:28] <%Cozy90> for some reason i really dig the hood physics on her jacket
[1:52:29] <@Jekado> combat seems rough
[1:52:36] <%Cerabret100> Yes it has a ranged attack
[1:52:37] <Carquar> @ThomasOfTroy I mean, humans do that too sometimes
[1:52:37] <+shabop> nailed it
[1:52:39] <+Kangumosa> Don’t mess with Hippos, legit the most dangerous animal africa
[1:52:43] <@Jekado> like purposefully rough
[1:52:44] <%Deekman> What a mess lol
[1:52:44] <%Axellogic> I remember the guy I watch had alot of trouble with those who spit
[1:52:45] <@Ranryu692> @Cozy90 the physics on her entire outfit are great
[1:52:53] <spuginky> Damn these throwback camera angles!
[1:52:53] <%ironohki> Hey gang. Is Pat playing a good game or a bad game?
[1:52:57] <BobbsonDugnutt> That backflip is super goofy LUL
[1:52:59] <SaltyAzteca> gottem
[1:53:01] <@Ranryu692> @ironohki yes
[1:53:03] <xeros720> 2nd one went a lot better
[1:53:05] <+Alopekis> I'd fight a hippo right now. I just don't feel like it.
[1:53:10] <%ironohki> @ironohki Nice.
[1:53:11] <Carquar> @ironohki Yep
[1:53:12] <BinaryBetrayer> Blackflip with NO LEGS
[1:53:13] <$lotharrio> I like that if you hit them while they are faking dead, they spasm up and then go back to laying down.
[1:53:14] <@TheYellowcouch> we're really in it now
[1:53:14] <%Cozy90> @Ranryu692 true but i just really love that one in particular for some reason
[1:53:14] <+Kangumosa> I think Pat will nail this game
[1:53:14] <+GuilKato> did it die with the same death sound as the monsters in quake?
[1:53:14] <@GeneralSCPatton> @ironohki He's playing A game

[2:02:01] <DJMesoPhunk> @DSD24 it has the RE HD controls, tank if you use D-Pad, good controls if you use the stick
[2:02:03] <BigFingerRo> @Cozy90 Silent Evil sounds like a Best of the Worst candidate

[2:31:00] <SaltyAzteca> Yeah I can feel that
[2:31:07] <@TheYellowcouch> On purpose or "on purpose"
[2:31:11] <%SirGO0SE> sounds like what youve been asking fro tbh
[2:31:14] <Profmcstevie> Having a pointer for menus is also fairly odd and awkward at times
[2:31:16] <%saadi90> Needs a shotgun
[2:31:22] <otakon17> now loot the body!
[2:31:26] <@Ranryu692> he fell down a shot early
[2:31:28] <%Bailey__gaming> can these dudes do Stairs?
[2:31:31] <%Mattais88> Limited saves are a terrible system
[2:31:33] <%DianaTheAscian> @patstaresat how much would you say it's like old RE?
[2:31:33] <otakon17> at least you found more nails
[2:31:35] <%Raikouija> PogChamp Somebody actually DID! RESIDENTEVIL is back boiz!
[2:31:36] <%cooldude69xx> How do you do anything without getting hit?
[2:31:42] <@Ranryu692> he went down at 7 instead of the usual 8. maybe that's why he needed the extra hit when he got up
[2:31:45] <+GhostAnimals> @Bailey__gaming Don't be rude, they're in wheelchairs
[2:31:48] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> yo @patstaresat , am I the only piece of shit in here who thinks her outfit is stupid?

[2:32:06] <otakon17> I hear breathing
[2:32:06] <%DianaTheAscian> it's dumb
[2:32:06] <%logoth_> Maybe its dumb on purpose
[2:32:07] <+sileo_patronus> @cooldude69xx use the dodge to avoid the damage
[2:32:09] <definitelynotjayy> RE with a royal guard
[2:32:18] <@Ranryu692> I think it's cute
[2:32:19] <ohno778> It's fine.

[2:32:39] <%cooldude69xx> @cooldude69xx The dodge seems kind of trash tbh
[2:32:40] <otakon17> is that a blunderbuss!?
[2:32:41] <%Nit3Vizion> Gotta do the thing!
[2:32:42] <DJMesoPhunk> @Raikouija she gets knocked out when she gets here and wakes up in a tub with her eye missing
[2:32:43] <marrowjuice> wow, i am really not feeling these enemy designs
[2:32:50] <%Garthunox> nope dot gif
[2:32:51] <definitelynotjayy> hoodie and butt bow clash waaaay too much
[2:32:54] <otakon17> maybe you can get a sneak attack on it with the crowbar?
[2:32:57] <@Ranryu692> dafuq
[2:33:04] <otakon17> I think he's STRAPPED to the wall
[2:33:04] <akitanito> can you just shoot him
[2:33:07] <PanicSwytch> Maybe he's friendly LUL
[2:33:09] <Aoworth> vibin
[2:33:14] <%Raikouija> @Raikouija that's terrifying
[2:33:17] <Dr_Mooose> can he slap?
[2:33:18] <zerointelligence000> he got stuck on a tv stand
[2:33:20] <otakon17> like some living trap
[2:33:20] <%Bailey__gaming> this some kinky shit
[2:33:22] <bear_breaker20> he's waiting for his surgery like most canadians
[2:33:26] <RyuuAoi> Shoot it?
[2:33:32] <%maskofmichael> do it
[2:33:33] <%FunkyStreams> He's lacking his OnlyFans content
[2:33:35] <otakon17> so is this for Switch or what?
[2:33:37] <+polothegreatest> lazy boi
[2:33:37] <%RealThiele> b o n k
[2:33:43] <%JoshManVGH> Feature or bug? You decide!
[2:33:44] <roobanguy> man thats one powerful lighter
[2:33:46] <RyuuAoi> @bear_breaker20 *Americans
[2:33:52] <BlackStarAura> They look like wheelchair necromorphs
[2:33:57] <%Raikouija> djm
[2:33:57] <otakon17> oh hey center safe room
[2:34:02] <DJMesoPhunk> @otakon17 PS5 and Steam for now, other platforms later
[2:34:22] <otakon17> huh haven't seen a classic RE style Survival Horror in ages
[2:34:25] <%cooldude69xx> Is there no way to defeat the villainous disabled?
[2:34:27] <Aoworth> the decor of this hospital is ridiculous
[2:34:29] <%Raikouija> her look reminds me of a fatal frame girl tbh
[2:34:32] <bear_breaker20> @RyuuAoi p sure canada's got it worst on the wait times
[2:34:37] <%JoshManVGH> This is a hell of a manspital
[2:34:40] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> her outfit clashes so much I think it might be heavy-handed symbolism. like, it says something about her character.
[2:34:40] <owazowski> Booba
[2:34:42] <%Bailey__gaming> bonk with crowbar
[2:34:47] <%MidnightBurst12> stone booba
[2:34:47] <%FunkyStreams> @BlackStarAura 100% Im not sure what late 90's videogame trope they're getting at with that.
[2:34:49] <%JoshManVGH> Hospion.
[2:34:58] <@Ranryu692> but the prom's tomorrow!
[2:35:10] <RyuuAoi> @bear_breaker20 Idk....I've waited 5 plus hours in the ER. Ha
[2:35:11] <otakon17> break the statue to reveal it's goodies like a porcelin pinata!
[2:35:13] <%JoshManVGH> She's a HEARTBREAKER!
[2:35:20] <slix3431> Pat where does this fit in the souls series?
[2:35:21] <+GhostAnimals> WTF kind of gun even is that?
[2:35:34] <%Bailey__gaming> Sword
[2:35:35] <otakon17> a small pigeon?
[2:35:37] <akitanito> looks like a pipe gun
[2:35:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> booo
[2:35:40] <%Raikouija> i thought that was a nail gun
[2:35:40] <DJMesoPhunk> a nailgun
[2:35:42] <%cooldude69xx> All the not-combat parts seem top notch so far
[2:35:43] <otakon17> ...then how big is a small pidgeon?
[2:35:44] <$Trenr> a small pigeon?
[2:35:44] <%CaityCoopScoops> pat...
[2:35:44] <@TheYellowcouch> are you proud of that one?
[2:35:45] <%Cozy90> smidgeon?
[2:35:45] <Animal_Farm4> The more you know
[2:35:47] <GarettLefebvre> And fix her big ass shadow
[2:35:47] <%DianaTheAscian> booo
[2:35:47] <+KaguraRaion> @GhostAnimals Nailgun
[2:35:49] <olm46> I'm stealing that
[2:35:49] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Wow, that a lot in terms of cooking
[2:35:51] <%MugenSandan> No it's not it's the size of a smidgen
[2:35:53] <HotMafia81> That's a lot
[2:35:54] <$Trenr> is that like, half a cup?
[2:35:57] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> a smidgen of salt would be salty as fuck
[2:36:08] <otakon17> yeah small pigeons are still fairly large
[2:36:08] <@TheYellowcouch> this makes sense now
[2:36:08] <+Basker17> pidgeons are doves
[2:36:13] <bear_breaker20> @RyuuAoi oh thats ER i meant scheduled stuff with month/years wait time
[2:36:13] <otakon17> like a fist
[2:36:15] <+GhostAnimals> I didn't even realize that big boxy thing was a gun, I was talking about the weird tube thing
[2:36:15] <%Cozy90> rachel is also a push over
[2:36:23] <%cooldude69xx> @otakon17 Less than a medium pidgeon, but more than a tiny pidgeon
[2:36:24] <$bootysteve> Is this a spooky
[2:36:24] <otakon17> there it is, SMASH THE GLASS!
[2:36:24] <Yrefe> oh man Friends was so good until it wasn't

[2:37:44] <Aoworth> That's a weird-ass statue
[2:37:44] <%Hilleltaco> Hilleltaco subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! I had a dream the other day that Zangief the dog tackled me to the floor. His influence spreads further by the day
[2:37:44] <stantheman_97> i keep thinking that breathing is zangief

[2:38:15] <RyuuAoi> Tickle him
[2:38:16] <akitanito> lol
[2:38:18] <slix3431> That was so scary
[2:38:18] <Dr_Mooose> weird kink but ok
[2:38:19] <otakon17> THEY CAN BE KILLED!
[2:38:19] <reonome> D:
[2:38:21] <+condemned_15> bonk
[2:38:23] <%SpoonheadInExile> Ew he came
[2:38:24] <otakon17> EASIEST OBSTACLE EVER
[2:38:24] <%cooldude69xx> Is this really the way?
[2:38:25] <%Treasure_Vault> 7
[2:38:32] <%FunkyStreams> good treatment plan, Pat.
[2:38:32] <@Ranryu692> I wonder if it'll get back up
[2:38:32] <%Mattais88> beat him till he cries
[2:38:33] <BlackStarAura> Eww
[2:38:37] <Animal_Farm4> "puzzle"
[2:38:45] <%Raikouija> you could say you "nailed" it scifriSMUG
[2:38:47] <Enn19> Is it a puzzle tho? LUL
[2:38:48] <akitanito> it's probably to screw with your puzzle senses
[2:38:49] <RyuuAoi> Take his weapons! Dafuq!
[2:38:50] <@TheYellowcouch> puzzleeeeesss
[2:38:50] <%cooldude69xx> It felt like the fighter trying to skip the dungeon puzzle with attack rolls
[2:38:55] <otakon17> smack it again!
[2:38:59] <slix3431> Ah
[2:39:00] <Boegame> apply crowbar to wall friend
[2:39:03] <%cooldude69xx> But the DM was like "Perfect!"
[2:39:04] <%FunkyStreams> you really pried your way through this one.
[2:39:04] <slix3431> Ahe
[2:39:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> puzzles in games are barely puzzles
[2:39:11] <otakon17> This is The Fighter just kicking in the door and smashing the chest with his greathammer
[2:39:11] <Aoworth> Very threatening
[2:39:12] <DartAran> Those would be more dangerous with other enemies around though
[2:39:20] <DJMesoPhunk> it's not a puzzle? it was exactly as you said, progress block until you turned the lights on
[2:39:22] <%Mattais88> Shouldn't they be one hit obstacles? no twelve?
[2:39:24] <RyuuAoi> BEST PUZZLE
[2:39:24] <$lotharrio> I could see them being a problem when you have to dodge around other enemies.
[2:39:24] <%Raikouija> a door knocker
[2:39:25] <+the_drummaestro> ok...
[2:39:26] <otakon17> KNOCKER HELL YEAH!
[2:39:29] <Animal_Farm4> SOS
[2:39:30] <+bugz_munny> hERRO?
[2:39:35] <%Raikouija> LUL
[2:39:38] <+Basker17> they kinda sound like the monsters from Deadly Premonition
[2:39:38] <%SpoonheadInExile> Just once I would love to have a game with realistic location damage
[2:39:42] <@TheYellowcouch> so that's what happened to Ethan's hand
[2:39:44] <otakon17> beating heart?
[2:39:57] <%Bluwizard21> @PlainSimpleTailor dead space?
[2:40:03] <+bugz_munny> thats a good camera angle
[2:40:08] <%Raikouija> @PlainSimpleTailor does MGS3 technically count?
[2:40:13] <otakon17> I mean, Dead Space has location based damage
[2:40:14] <%Bailey__gaming> a clock?
[2:40:15] <%SpoonheadInExile> @Bluwizard21 Oh?
[2:40:15] <%cooldude69xx> @DJMesoPhunk That's probably more accurate
[2:40:21] <Aoworth> @lotharrio Yeah maybe there's a Mr. X type guy or s/t
[2:40:23] <%Treasure_Vault> Dead Space remake is having even more localized damage
[2:40:23] <mattynezz> Try the simple "buh-bump" rhythm of a heart maybe?
[2:40:39] <otakon17> maybe the wall guys are meant to catch you offguard while being chased by mobile enemies?
[2:40:39] <%SpoonheadInExile> @Raikouija Do characters limp if you shoot the leg?
[2:40:44] <Teyaric> I'm noticing a BIG theme of parts being removed, replaced, and swapped around.
[2:40:45] <%Raikouija> @Treasure_Vault there's footage out of it?
[2:40:47] <+bugz_munny> bio lab?
[2:40:54] <+ThomasTheCrankEngine> this game any good?
[2:40:58] <otakon17> there's some screencaps
[2:41:02] <%Raikouija> @PlainSimpleTailor snake does?
[2:41:02] <otakon17> the game looks PURTY
[2:41:14] <+bugz_munny> oh shit
[2:41:14] <%Treasure_Vault> @Treasure_Vault Dunno, just what I read on the subreddit
[2:41:15] <%FFXIVsFreeTrial> The great immovable wet floor signs
[2:41:16] <otakon17> it looks fairly competent
[2:41:16] <%cooldude69xx> high bar
[2:41:19] <otakon17> if a bit generic
[2:41:20] <+bugz_munny> hes right
[2:41:22] <Boegame> thats a low bar :v
[2:41:25] <%Garthunox> thats like the room where you get rid of lisa trevor
[2:41:25] <Profmcstevie> so far
[2:41:26] <%RetroCop87> it's more of an RE than a SH
[2:41:28] <%NopeBadguy> Define "Shittier Silent Hills"
[2:41:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> that isnt a high bar pat
[2:41:29] <+ThomasTheCrankEngine> good deal for $20 though
[2:41:30] <Khester824> Blocked by wet floor signs
[2:41:30] <%JoshManVGH> please stick the landing
[2:41:31] <%Agami23> its at least better than downpour and homecoming. still not sure for silent hill 4
[2:41:32] <%maskofmichael> That's not a high bar
[2:41:33] <BlackStarAura> For a second there thought those knight statues were going to drop their swords on her
[2:41:34] <otakon17> and the safe room music is decent
[2:41:37] <%SpoonheadInExile> @Raikouija I mean specifically enemy NPCs
[2:41:38] <@TheYellowcouch> the etmosphere is doing a lot
[2:41:39] <mattynezz> Most things are better than the shittier SHs
[2:41:41] <%cooldude69xx> @NopeBadguy After 2
[2:41:41] <@Spydurman> gonna finish it on your own time?
[2:41:41] <%RealThiele> its a low bar sit, but they made it
[2:41:41] <DJMesoPhunk> @NopeBadguy most of them
[2:41:46] <stantheman_97> it looks like they actually cared
[2:41:48] <%Agami23> its better than a majority of resident evil
[2:41:50] <kingra> So pretty alright
[2:41:54] <+FoolsArcade> These monsters remind me of that one PS2 horror game in the prison tho I forget the name
[2:41:57] <%SpoonheadInExile> Totes not lit yo
[2:41:58] <meteor530> Woah is this like a Fatal Frame game?
[2:41:59] <%maskofmichael> @RetroCop87 It's like RE if SH sneezed on it
[2:42:07] <%Raikouija> @PlainSimpleTailor something like ARMAI think then
[2:42:10] <Enn19> @FoolsArcade THe Suffering?
[2:42:10] <otakon17> oh crap another wallman
[2:42:11] <%Raikouija> ARMA
[2:42:19] <otakon17> BAD WALL MAN
[2:42:23] <+FoolsArcade> @Enn19 thats the one!!
[2:42:24] <%RetroCop87> haha
[2:42:28] <otakon17> so darkness is bad
[2:42:35] <spuginky> NOW its a puzzle
[2:42:36] <+bugz_munny> John Cena
[2:42:45] <DJMesoPhunk> Pat, it's not "the beating heart" it's "the heart beat". big difference
[2:42:46] <Enn19> The statue?!
[2:42:49] <otakon17> so why can't you hit the guy with the crowbar?
[2:42:50] <Aoworth> As we all know you can't hold a lighter and a crowbar at the same time
[2:42:52] <meteor530> John China
[2:42:52] <%Raikouija> its an amnesia clone? Kappa
[2:42:58] <+Basker17> Have you saved?
[2:43:03] <+FoolsArcade> The monsters remind me of the Suffering!
[2:43:04] <otakon17> just use some nails on him, you have to get by him to progress it seems
[2:43:07] <+FoolsArcade> tyty
[2:43:08] <%Bluwizard21> its the rythym of the statue
[2:43:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Huh they megaman'ed that pretty well
[2:43:13] <%Bailey__gaming> @patstaresat John Gibson is famously a sculpture man
[2:43:23] <otakon17> oh man The Suffering is a game that should get a remake, really good horror shooter
[2:43:26] <meteor530> You should NOT save to increase the horror. REAL STAKES
[2:43:26] <+OhioNitsud> theres only one man you can steal a beating heart from....
[2:43:30] <otakon17> nails no good huh? shite
[2:43:46] <%NopeBadguy> Define "Shittier Silent Hills"
[2:43:50] <Srthunda> can you just outright burn that rope?
[2:43:54] <otakon17> pitch darkness making it impossible to attack IS an interesting game mechanic
[2:43:55] <%Bailey__gaming> his most famous sculpture is of Queen Vict
[2:43:58] <dmtjinni> First Impressions? @PatStaresAt
[2:44:05] <Maids4lyfe> so we got Resident Hill and Silent Evil, what else is this game?
[2:44:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @NopeBadguy Downcoming
[2:44:08] <%maskofmichael> @NopeBadguy Downcoming
[2:44:10] <GarettLefebvre> needs baby statue
[2:44:12] <Aoworth> Give her a cardigan, she's cold
[2:44:13] <%JoshManVGH> Is the shadow just the character model  blown up in a weird way?
[2:44:14] <+bugz_munny> it needs something that fits
[2:44:16] <%Piemen99> Is this a remake of something, or is it based on the old RE games?
[2:44:19] <%Alig200> darkness doesn't just stop you from attacking, it kills you if you dont light up quickly.
[2:44:22] <%Mattais88> Homepour
[2:44:26] <otakon17> have you tried combining it with the shotgun shells?
[2:44:31] <%Cozy90> i wonder if theres a Mrs. Z thats gonna chase us at some point or something
[2:44:35] <shift_of_dollars> This game is making feel a like  resident.. perhaps even a little evil hmm.
[2:44:36] <BlackStarAura> So many phones and no 911
[2:44:43] <%Monkeyweed21> your shadow is beefy
[2:44:49] <meteor530> This games reminds me of that Capcom horror game. Haunting or something?
[2:44:59] <%Alig200> Haunting Ground
[2:45:00] <Aoworth> Mmmm Flintstones chewable morphine
[2:45:01] <%Bailey__gaming> try a regular heartbeat
[2:45:03] <+Basker17> haunting ground
[2:45:03] <+GhostAnimals> Haunting Ground
[2:45:09] <HotMafia81> Her flashlight is projecting light omni-directionally, instead of in one specific direction, so it's casting a weird-ass shadow because of how close she is to it
[2:45:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> i want a spiritual successor to eternal darkness
[2:45:22] <%Piemen99> heh titty jiggles
[2:45:24] <Boegame> the game doesn't seem suited for roamers like mrx
[2:45:40] <DJMesoPhunk> @doc_ock_rokc they tried to make one. Denis Dyack fucked it up
[2:45:49] <+GhostAnimals> @HotMafia81 It's a lighter, so the omni-direction makes sense. Still looks weird though
[2:45:52] <Aoworth> Try a heartbeat rhythm?
[2:45:56] <%Mattais88> Shave and a haircut
[2:46:01] <meteor530> I'
[2:46:11] <meteor530> I'd like someone to save System Shock 3
[2:46:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hear beat rhythm?
[2:46:19] <%maskofmichael> @Mattais88 Two Bits!
[2:46:23] <+bugz_munny> oh hey
[2:46:36] <%cooldude69xx> @HotMafia81 Maybe we're just used to flashlights that dont focus on the player
[2:46:54] <BlackStarAura> Those fucking statues moved
[2:47:07] <RrenKrieg> just got home from work what's happening?
[2:47:16] <Profmcstevie> "Make new baby, twins" stuff fer sure
[2:47:17] <%Raikouija> ink ribbons TOO in this game?!? 👏
[2:47:18] <owazowski> Miscarriage demon??
[2:47:19] <%Raikouija> nice
[2:47:19] <+Basker17> ohhh saves are items
[2:47:28] <%Mattais88> scope the statue
[2:47:31] <RyuuAoi> May none of you ever have to use Preparation H. That's the real horror.
[2:47:35] <+Derc127> Stethoscope to hear heartbeat rhythm?
[2:47:37] <%Cozy90> Well she better start looking for the baby
[2:47:46] <+GhostAnimals> I feel like video games really overestimate the destructive power of the nail gun.
[2:47:48] <+the_drummaestro> love the save items system
[2:47:56] <%BinaryFireball> what is this game?
[2:47:56] <meteor530> Those RE4 statues look like they gonna swinbg at cha
[2:47:57] <%BinaryFireball> is it good?
[2:48:02] <BlackStarAura> The knight statues with swords when she passed them
[2:48:15] <@TheYellowcouch> We're all just fiending
[2:48:20] <%BinaryFireball> is it a good knockoff?
[2:48:23] <%maskofmichael> Hear the boob
[2:48:23] <tanarath> It's pretty good
[2:48:27] <otakon17> MARK THAT DOWN!
[2:48:28] <%Raikouija> Indie devs to capcom: Fine we'll do it ourselves
[2:48:28] <RrenKrieg> sounds like morse'
[2:48:31] <%BinaryFireball> nice
[2:48:32] <%Cozy90> Pat would you play an RE outbreak with this engine?
[2:48:34] <Profmcstevie> A taste I haven't known since I was a young lad lytWHAT
[2:48:39] <HotMafia81> ***'s horror section would beg to differ
[2:48:39] <otakon17> someone take  a proper note!
[2:48:39] <BlackStarAura> They want that ass
[2:48:43] <RyuuAoi> @binaryfireball I thought Fatal Frame, but looks like a rip off of that, RE, and Silent Hill.
[2:48:48] <%RyTYoung> 465
[2:48:49] <%solracc25> ze hearto
[2:48:54] <otakon17> seriously, Outbreak NOWADAYS would be a gREAT game
[2:48:55] <gtl1220> pat i would like to solve the puzzle
[2:48:56] <RrenKrieg> this game looks amazing
[2:48:58] <akitanito> 1 3 2
[2:48:59] <%Raikouija> I never understood why capcom stopped making games like this, there is a market for fixed camera games
[2:49:01] <BinaryBetrayer> BYOND engine
[2:49:03] <RyuuAoi> 1 3 2
[2:49:06] <%Cozy90> I really just want an outbreal :(
[2:49:09] <ZimmiZ> this looks comfy
[2:49:12] <%RyTYoung> How about an Evil Within 1 and 2 revisit @patstaresat
[2:49:13] <meteor530> Capcom need to get their heads out of their ass's and make a proper RE Outbreak. It can be done correctly now.
[2:49:20] <%Alig200> the timing is very exact for this.
[2:49:21] <+FoolsArcade> too fast?
[2:49:28] <DJMesoPhunk> might have to exit out if you screw up
[2:49:31] <GarettLefebvre> 1 3 1 2
[2:49:33] <%BinaryFireball> @RyuuAoi ah cool
[2:49:34] <Enn19> Was there more beats?
[2:49:36] <RyuuAoi> Outbreak REmake. Yell for it!
[2:49:38] <xeros720> i thought it was 1 3 1 2 yeah
[2:49:45] <@Ranryu692> those last two need more spacing
[2:49:48] <otakon17> there we go
[2:49:50] <%Raikouija> scifriSHRUG
[2:49:51] <ironoverloaded> Just joined, how's the game going, guys?
[2:49:51] <%JoshManVGH> Nice
[2:49:51] <gtl1220> @patstaresat would u do a battle report with bricky or dk
[2:49:54] <@TheYellowcouch> cool puzzle ngl
[2:49:55] <%NitronStreams> oof
[2:49:57] <+DeadlyPeaks> Does anyone know if Daymare is of similar quality to this game?
[2:49:59] <otakon17> oh shit what is THAT noise
[2:49:59] <RyuuAoi> 1 3 4 2
[2:50:00] <%JoshManVGH> more save
[2:50:05] <bear_breaker20> who let you in?
[2:50:06] <%Raikouija> nail gun go BRRRRRR
[2:50:09] <%anAngryHamster> Imagine if we just an over-the-shoulder Outbreak instead of ORC
[2:50:15] <%Axellogic> I think the puzzle are all fairly intense
[2:50:15] <DJMesoPhunk> @DeadlyPeaks Daymare is trash. get this instead
[2:50:17] <akitanito> boss?
[2:50:18] <%JoshManVGH> More drugs
[2:50:19] <Dr_Mooose> whatever that is sounds big
[2:50:19] <GarettLefebvre> wall guy or something big?
[2:50:22] <otakon17> maybe save because something sounds angry
[2:50:24] <Enn19> Boss time?
[2:50:26] <%Piemen99> that doesn't sound good
[2:50:30] <+GhostAnimals> @TheYellowcouch Probably could've been designed a little better, though. The timing at the end seemed a little janky with no indication
[2:50:32] <+bugz_munny> :O
[2:50:40] <SaltyAzteca> I hope late in the game she gets a shotgun LUL
[2:50:41] <reonome> :O
[2:50:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> ...What a crappy oil filter over a 3d render!
[2:50:46] <RrenKrieg> @anAngryHamster i'd take it, as long as they capture the same atmosphere as outbreak
[2:50:46] <meteor530> Yes....awaken the devil
[2:50:47] <godzookylives> OOF THOSE FACES

[3:08:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Hey pat I figured out how to fake doing haptic feedback into a ps5 controller. If you have a virtual audio mixer you can make the controller a speaker and feed audio into it (in studio repeat mode) then put a sound gate if its a bit much. Only downside is music also activates the  "rumble" but it works amazingly well for pc
[3:08:29] <%FunkyStreams> totally there for a discernible reason
[3:08:42] <%TheotherKristian> I just got here and I want to confirm that this is in fact a Resident Evil?
[3:08:46] <@GeneralSCPatton> NBC's Ultimate Slip 'N Slide basically died during construction because of an outbreak of giardia. They can't adequately decontaminate the ground and water supply.

[3:24:30] <lucidcalyx> it looks... really nice in this stream
[3:24:31] <Bloodninja15> She kinda thicc
[3:24:33] <%SWFanatic> shits locked
[3:24:48] <%IMDRanged> ^
[3:24:48] <+GuilKato> use it on gears maybe?
[3:24:50] <+sileo_patronus> @lucidcalyx I'm sure you could manage fine
[3:24:53] <Profmcstevie> Shotguns a lot of force lytSMUG
[3:24:54] <%anAngryHamster> Did Pat ever get the key withe rotating symbols?
[3:24:54] <$lotharrio> Yes it was. The lock is internal.
[3:25:03] <lucidcalyx> main character girl is my new waifu also
[3:25:06] <DJMesoPhunk> @anAngryHamster not yet
[3:25:06] <%watts121> wait...does she have jiggle physics?
[3:25:06] <%ThirdWelles> They're talking about the gears on the door you just tried
[3:25:11] <%RetroCop87> The Universal Will!?
[3:25:11] <+GuilKato> the door had the handle and gears for the mechanism
[3:25:14] <%IMDRanged> Jibble Sandwich this shit
[3:25:17] <bangleyjelly> @DJMesoPhunk I literally started getting intoold RE a 2 months ago, and ive been sad that games like this arent being made anymore. Now this?? what a treat. im def gonna buy
[3:25:20] <%ThirdWelles> I doubt it'd work
[3:25:20] <+GuilKato> though that was just a guess
[3:25:22] <%ThirdWelles> Honestly
[3:25:24] <%Undenizen> in real life, you would have just poured the acid all over it, nothing would have happened, and you'd be fucked because you won't have it for whatever you actually need it for.
[3:25:34] <%Piemen99> Yes
[3:25:35] <BigFingerRo> OH NOOOO I'M STUPID!
[3:25:37] <+sileo_patronus> 20/20
[3:25:38] <lucidcalyx> Did Pat rant about how great her design is yet?

[3:26:01] <%anAngryHamster> I forgot where that key and I played this yesterday
[3:26:08] <%ThirdWelles> His what now
[3:26:08] <%watts121> any puzzle with cogs, usually means you need to find more cogs
[3:26:12] <+GuilKato> ah well - figured melt/lube the gears to make it open
[3:26:14] <DJMesoPhunk> @bangleyjelly yeah, there are still some being made but they're mostly godawful crap made by people who don't get what the classic formula was. this one is bang on, it's really well done, even with the bit of jank that is there
[3:26:16] <+sileo_patronus> the gears are definitely targetable though
[3:26:28] <%ThirdWelles> He can see but he cannot *perceive*

[3:26:44] <Profmcstevie> Seeing and noticing are two different things
[3:26:46] <bangleyjelly> @DJMesoPhunk I love the jank.
[3:26:49] <%LymanAl> Hard drive mag 'blind streamer boasts perfect vision'
[3:27:06] <%Bluwizard21> why does she walk like she's in zero g?
[3:27:06] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:27:13] <%ThirdWelles> is that a safe?
[3:27:15] <%SirGO0SE> @bassoontyphoon booo
[3:27:15] <%ThirdWelles> on the table?
[3:27:26] <%Piemen99> Man if only AngrestPat was here he would have found the key just like anAngryHamster
[3:28:01] <DJMesoPhunk> @bangleyjelly right? people pretend like there wasn't a ton of jank in the actual old games, and there very much is. it's great.
[3:28:14] <+kralec> tetris?

[3:28:24] <%ThirdWelles> Put the inputs that would give you a tetris if you were playing tetris
[3:28:30] <%ThirdWelles> there were arrows, right?
[3:28:33] <bear_breaker20> Jesus no!
[3:28:37] <%IMDRanged> psaHoldon
[3:28:47] <%Alig200> @PatStaresAt go back to that operating room and look at what the masked guy was doing
[3:28:48] <DJMesoPhunk> you're not done in the operating room. what was the big guy doing through the window?
[3:29:07] <+ValHollaYoloson> The operating room puzzle is tied to the observation room.
[3:29:07] <%IMDRanged> psaSmug
[3:29:13] <+ValHollaYoloson> Yup that’s it
[3:29:15] <+kralec> that is some esoteric bullshit, i'm down. rooKek
[3:29:15] <%ThirdWelles> Can we try tetris door again after? is that a tough puzzle, or a missing key?
[3:29:16] <%Meekest> That's... Huh
[3:29:18] <akitanito> that is weird
[3:29:23] <kingra> Yep LUL
[3:29:24] <%IMDRanged> Convoluted BS
[3:29:24] <%Undenizen> that's a rather extreme "hint" but
[3:29:26] <coreyyotto> makes sense i guess
[3:29:26] <DJMesoPhunk> I mean, the priest did tell you the legend of how they revived people.
[3:29:28] <Clyderso> Pap Squares Rat
[3:29:29] <Aoworth> That's up there in obtuse puzzle solutions
[3:29:29] <%Sigma_190_Beta> It is weird.
[3:29:35] <+ValHollaYoloson> It’s incredibly obscure
[3:30:00] <%ThirdWelles> oh you're copying the gas mask guy
[3:30:06] <%SirGO0SE> wtf that is weird
[3:30:14] <%Undenizen> he's a friend. let him up
[3:30:15] <%watts121> that is weird
[3:30:15] <akitanito> yo

[3:31:02] <%MidnightBurst12> shotgun solves all
[3:31:03] <%SWFanatic> thats a bingo
[3:31:04] <bear_breaker20> 80 nails for a reason
[3:31:07] <+InuOblivion> tanked
[3:31:09] <%strakillias> Imagine using the nail gun on him
[3:31:13] <%MidnightBurst12> ez
[3:31:13] <%Cozy90> boss fight?
[3:31:14] <boof_abroad> he has legs so he's like 100 times stronger
[3:31:16] <bangleyjelly> @DJMesoPhunk I think jank  adds a lot to the horror of the old games. Like when youre in a dream and youre running from something and you keep fumbling and falling. its like playing a nightmare
[3:31:19] <%ThirdWelles> Damn I don't think I would have ever figured that out
[3:31:19] <%Raikouija> it looks sexy how she pops out the shell
[3:31:22] <%ThirdWelles> Actually
[3:31:33] <Aoworth> Acid scalpel
[3:31:36] <+ValHollaYoloson> This room was a real hang up, and I was forced to look at a guide
[3:31:41] <%ThirdWelles> Cut corpse?
[3:31:42] <Aoworth> Extra elemental damage
[3:31:46] <%ThirdWelles> Is there a corpse to cut?
[3:31:52] <%strakillias> rope hatch?
[3:31:57] <TheFramedWarlock> Operate on that dude's corpse ?
[3:32:00] <%ThirdWelles> Like that's the first thing that comes to mind
[3:32:02] <MittensBroadcast> reminds me of RE
[3:32:05] <Profmcstevie> No we can.....perform surgery on our situation?
[3:32:08] <%The_Protagonist> the lighting in this game seems super jank but otherwise it seems cool :V
[3:32:08] <%Alig200> take out other eyes for lulz
[3:32:11] <coreyyotto> burn boy
[3:32:13] <%IMDRanged> Da hell?
[3:32:14] <MittensBroadcast> with the camera angles and stuff
[3:32:22] <%Undenizen> Yeah this game looks like Resident Hill.
[3:32:30] <%ThirdWelles> I haven't been here for more than like 20 minutes so I'm just polluting chat with bad ideas
[3:32:35] <%ThirdWelles> I'm sorry
[3:32:38] <Aoworth> I think it's more of a Silent Evil
[3:33:00] <+sileo_patronus> Resilent Evhill
[3:33:03] <%Raikouija> old school resi logic
[3:33:10] <%shadowace2400> I mean, it's an old school survival horror
[3:33:19] <%shadowace2400> it was always gonna have esoteric solutions
[3:33:20] <comicalmond9135> looks very silent hill
[3:33:23] <%SWFanatic> Aurora Borealis? At this time of year?
[3:33:24] <%ThirdWelles> God forbid you untie that trash knot
[3:33:26] <%IMDRanged> Progression
[3:33:29] <%NovaKnightmare> I prefer a game being esoteric and weird than to be piss easy but still I understand the frustrations with weird solutions
[3:33:29] <%ThirdWelles> gotta cut it
[3:33:30] <%Undenizen> I feel like there were easier ways to cut a rope.
[3:33:40] <%strakillias> Is mankind in this boiler room?
[3:33:41] <%Cozy90> do you think david lynch would like silent hill? or would he say "What the fuck is this shit?"
[3:33:43] <Mottyrob> Wow is this Silent Shill?
[3:33:45] <%Undenizen> i mean you have a GUN. gun will solve rope.
[3:33:46] <%ThirdWelles> Gas mask symbol
[3:33:51] <%ThirdWelles> *interesting*
[3:33:55] <%ValHollaYoloson> Yeah this game has some real abstract puzzles
[3:33:59] <%SWFanatic> mr snip snip
[3:34:01] <%thedankestmeeme> I gotta finish the hour to close up at the job can you give me some words of encouragement
[3:34:02] <+condemned_15> @ThirdWelles the protag is not a girl scout. She cant tie or untie knots
[3:34:03] <TheFramedWarlock> It's T-Virus Head
[3:34:05] <+sileo_patronus> oh god oh fuck
[3:34:07] <%ThirdWelles> NICE
[3:34:08] <%thedankestmeeme> im sleepy
[3:34:09] <%Undenizen> @Cozy90 he's too much of an angry old man to like games
[3:34:13] <%Raikouija> monkaS
[3:34:25] <crassletter> 20/20
[3:34:34] <%athuramn> @valhollayoloson I'm still taken aback by the earlier solution of having to walk around the table twice
[3:34:34] <Aoworth> That's a pretty good one
[3:34:47] <%ThirdWelles> Oh it's not a perfect dodge, it's just a jump back
[3:34:47] <%The_Protagonist> geez
[3:34:54] <%Raikouija> ded
[3:34:56] <%JoshManVGH> Woah spiky mass!
[3:35:00] <+GuilKato> Pat has become 5th element man! I NEED LIGHT!
[3:35:01] <akitanito> these guys move fast
[3:35:02] <bangleyjelly> this is like clocktower 4 meets Haunting ground meets eternal darkness meets resident evil meets silent hill
[3:35:02] <Essixian> @Cozy90 Eh, he might not enjoy playing them but I'm sure he could appreciate visual design if nothing else
[3:35:03] <%SWFanatic> Graaaarrrrruuh
[3:35:07] <DJMesoPhunk> yeah, none of the solutions are made up stuff. like straight up, the priest told you what to do.
[3:35:09] <iunderstoodthatreference> like an iron maiden enemy thing from re4
[3:35:11] <%Undenizen> I'm pretty sure that enemy has been in some heavy metal music videos.
[3:35:12] <%Faustgesicht> That dudes death scream reminds me of Nyanners
[3:35:14] <%Deft_Thought> This enemy designs are kinda...
[3:35:16] <%ThirdWelles> Wild Burger
[3:35:17] <%ValHollaYoloson> @athuramn Yeah it took me like 2 hours before I caved in and looked at a guide
[3:35:19] <%watts121> is this game working on adaptive difficulty?
[3:35:20] <%ThirdWelles> Wow that's a name
[3:35:23] <TheFramedWarlock> Where did that other guy go ?
[3:35:24] <%JoshManVGH> Aziz, Light!!!
[3:35:28] <%IMDRanged> @Cozy90 He probably would give a  Hidetaka Suehiro response, as in "never heard of it"
[3:35:32] <%Cozy90> yeah probably
[3:35:55] <%ThirdWelles> Sounds like a Lisa Trevor fight incoming
[3:35:56] <@TheYellowcouch> Maria huh
[3:36:10] <%SWFanatic> mr snip snip
[3:36:26] <%watts121> he gimp, he can't climb stairs
[3:36:30] <crassletter> there is another candle downstairs near tv
[3:36:32] <%IMDRanged> Triangle Girl is in this game, then

[3:37:13] <%The_Protagonist> you ain't go no legs Lieutenant Dan!
[3:37:14] <Aoworth> He can but he gets tired after the stairs it seems
[3:37:24] <%ThirdWelles> I'm just excited for assumedly discount lisa trevor to show up
[3:37:27] <$lotharrio> Pat the hero did it. He ran away from his enemy.

[3:38:26] <Nelsukako> the world really need more silent evil / resident hill in it
[3:38:47] <+condemned_15> Speaking of Lisa Trevor, that movie costume looks like some Spirit Halloween shit
[3:38:49] <%ThirdWelles> Maria just got hyped tho. So maybe a boss encounter?
[3:39:31] <Aoworth> monkaS

[3:40:28] <akitanito> an attempt was made
[3:40:40] <teefpal> So is this game good?  I've heard bad things
[3:40:41] <@TheYellowcouch> yeah not every locker scare can be the SH1 locker scare
[3:40:42] <Aoworth> Gave maybe a little too much anticipation
[3:40:42] <Nelsukako> exactly, i need more now
[3:40:44] <%ThirdWelles> The hell?
[3:40:47] <%Questiy> Thank god the music sting was there to make sure I was scared!
[3:40:54] <%Treasure_Vault> Classic.
[3:41:08] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Your own shadow looks like it's trying to kill you
[3:41:26] <%ThirdWelles> Mr Scratch and snip
[3:41:31] <%CalderGaming> good juke
[3:41:34] <Aoworth> That was a better scare
[3:41:51] <%Deft_Thought> Damn, that goes far
[3:41:55] <%Faustgesicht> Is green and red on the map just what's lit and dark?
[3:41:56] <teefpal> lol what is this music
[3:42:19] <%SWFanatic> Fine Caroline
[3:42:19] <%Raikouija> You can be like, ILL CUT YOUR SHIT
[3:42:22] <%FunkyStreams> what they could fit onto the rom
[3:42:24] <+GuilKato> she needs to learn to move the candleabra with her
[3:42:25] <Profmcstevie> Not your zelda key item
[3:42:25] <Nelsukako> i really love some good old survival horror junk and it makes me sad that they just stopped doing it because some executive said it is bad for business or wathever
[3:42:33] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[3:42:34] <%CalderGaming> LE BEBE
[3:42:35] <mak0t0yukii> HON HON HON
[3:42:43] <%SWFanatic> lol
[3:42:43] <BigFingerRo> FRENCH ADFRENCHIURE
[3:42:46] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah normal baby names
[3:42:50] <scrumbotime> normal baby names
[3:42:55] <%peyodogo> the french accent is so, so, so, so much better on the ears than australian
[3:42:57] <%peyodogo> bless
[3:42:59] <+the_drummaestro> Merci Pat
[3:43:00] <%Piemen99> HON GON BAGUETTE
[3:43:03] <%MugenSandan> why is one baby name almost normal and the other a biblical angel
[3:43:04] <%KuroStardust> Baguette?
[3:43:07] <teefpal> Sometimes I forget pat is Canadian and can just spit French
[3:43:08] <BlackStarAura> CRIKEY
[3:43:16] <%Undenizen> "Methushael" = Methuselah + Samael?
[3:43:19] <BigFingerRo> Now you must finish the remainder of the stream with an annoying french accent like david cage's
[3:43:30] <%JoshManVGH> Danny and Alestor The Dark Risen
[3:43:47] <teefpal> he did a flip
[3:43:47] <%athuramn> mais oui oui chez la noir chien
[3:43:51] <Aoworth> The way they flip over is pretty comical
[3:43:52] <%Deft_Thought> That backflip is some funny shit
[3:43:53] <teefpal> 10/10
[3:44:00] <%maskofmichael> @teefpal It's because he's from Quebec
[3:44:01] <%ThirdWelles> zap floor
[3:44:13] <%ThirdWelles> Don't fuck with secondary voltages, yo
[3:44:28] <%JoshManVGH> Wait, there's a Les Enfant Treible joke in here somewhere...
[3:44:31] <teefpal> @teefpal Yeah like I said, Canada
[3:44:39] <Profmcstevie> God trying to guess where you are on the map is butt
[3:44:47] <TheFramedWarlock> That's a fucking resident evil if I ever saw one
[3:44:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> no shit's locked/
[3:44:52] <%ThirdWelles> Why  even put those stairs there
[3:44:57] <Aoworth> The floor is TOO wet, you'll never make it
[3:44:57] <%ThirdWelles> That's so stupid
[3:44:59] <%Mattais88> wasn't there another puzzle on the other side of the hall?
[3:45:03] <Essixian> Oh my god, I HATE health systems like that. Is "Fine" better or worse than "Ok"?!
[3:45:06] <%Undenizen> it's IMPOSSIBLE to get past those signs. there could be a wet floor behind them
[3:45:22] <%ThirdWelles> Did dial match up with symbols on tetris door?
[3:45:31] <%Bluwizard21> wasnt that shape down in the basement?
[3:45:40] <Essixian> @Undenizen She might get her fancy bow wet
[3:45:54] <%ThirdWelles> I was wrong
[3:45:57] <%ThirdWelles> Oh so very wrong
[3:46:05] <%ThirdWelles> Those are much more abstract symbols
[3:46:13] <teefpal> I dunno why but I'm just not vibing with this game
[3:46:16] <DJMesoPhunk> if you need another hint/push, just say the word
[3:46:32] <Essixian> @PatStaresAt What do you think of the character's design? The leather jacket says "biker girl" but the dress says "swedish farm maiden".
[3:46:38] <DJMesoPhunk> how did you turn on the power at the start of the game?
[3:46:39] <%moink1234> Play game solve puzzle your welcome
[3:46:40] <%Estuko> Press forward to move your character
[3:46:41] <teefpal> HINT: git gud
[3:46:41] <%MugenSandan> Hint: Do not die
[3:46:45] <%Undenizen> @Essixian I hate the health system on all horror games like this. give me a god damn number or obvious hit points
[3:46:50] <%solracc25> other door
[3:46:53] <%ValHollaYoloson> You gotta deenergize the water
[3:47:02] <%ThirdWelles> "How did you turn on the power at the beginning of  the game"
[3:47:03] <%moink1234> Read library to get hint?
[3:47:06] <%ThirdWelles> Says DJ
[3:47:20] <madejustforchat> chat of the lake, give me your wisdom
[3:47:25] <Profmcstevie> Kill the power....oh nooo
[3:47:28] <Aoworth> @Essixian The uncertainty adds suspense to the game tho
[3:47:29] <Essixian> Have you tried fucking the door
[3:47:30] <%ThirdWelles> Man that's fucky
[3:47:30] <gtl1220> try not to become a jill sandwich
[3:47:34] <%MajorCrasher> just follow the damn train cj
[3:47:34] <%ThirdWelles> Time for dark
[3:47:37] <%ThirdWelles> Lots of dark
[3:47:40] <teefpal> @Essixian The character design is really off.  She doesn't look good
[3:47:47] <%SWFanatic> what flavor is a jill sandwich?
[3:47:48] <DJMesoPhunk> there was a sign right next to the water that is the same sign as the generator room door
[3:47:57] <akitanito> no more security
[3:47:59] <teefpal> @SWFanatic pork?
[3:48:01] <Essixian> @Aoworth The uncertainty adds frustration to my butthole
[3:48:14] <%SWFanatic> @SWFanatic =\
[3:48:15] <+gheremy84> She kinda looks like discount ds2 emerald herald
[3:48:17] <Essixian> @Essixian I dunno, I kinda like it. It's distinct, if nothing else.
[3:48:17] <%ThirdWelles> Yeah character design is real bad. it's like anime girl but euro jank
[3:48:18] <crassletter> @SWFanatic ham
[3:48:32] <+MoroseLoki> lumituPewpew
[3:48:32] <%maskofmichael> Is this a bad game or a horror game? You decide!
[3:48:36] <%Alig200> iirc, you get that for killing 25 enmies
[3:48:43] <%SWFanatic> for some reason i was thinking more like fruit
[3:48:44] <%Mattais88> "They look like mosters to you?"
[3:48:44] <@SoFarFetched> Paige would deconstruct the jill sandwich if it had ham
[3:48:45] <%Cozy90> music sounds like it could go DMC at any moment during a fight
[3:48:48] <+GhostAnimals> @ThirdWelles This was the description I've been trying to come to since I started watching the stream, thank you
[3:48:50] <%anAngryHamster> Did you examine that pillar in the middle of the other room?
[3:49:17] <%ValHollaYoloson> Exactly
[3:49:19] <DJMesoPhunk> yep. it's actually very intuitive lol
[3:49:23] <Essixian> @teefpal I'll say this, the bow on her back is a bit much.
[3:49:24] <%ThirdWelles> aw man fuck this darkness
[3:49:48] <%solracc25> enemy not respawn , good
[3:49:49] <%CalderGaming> safety eyes
[3:49:53] <%ValHollaYoloson> Yup
[3:49:53] <%AzureGale> Safety eyes
[3:49:54] <akitanito> why not "secure"
[3:49:59] <%AncelDeLambert> and then be sure to Safety Dance
[3:50:01] <%watts121> You say that, then the game starts throwing Crimson Head Gimps at you.
[3:50:01] <%MugenSandan> Disinfect them with BULLETS
[3:50:01] <%The_Protagonist> special eyes
[3:50:05] <akitanito> okay
[3:50:06] <%maskofmichael> @SoFarFetched I'm on a diet, trying to lose weight, I'll just have the Jill.
[3:50:06] <Essixian> Secure the area, check those corners

[4:14:08] <%Deft_Thought> This music, god damn

[4:14:19] <@TheYellowcouch> yeah classic re enemies should be designed like mario enemies
[4:14:20] <%ThirdWelles> DIAL TIME
[4:14:23] <@SoFarFetched> @HayabusaZeroZ came out on the 26th apparently
[4:14:25] <%RealThiele> time shenanigans
[4:14:25] <%Alig200> @PatStaresAt dont you just love going through the Arboretum in Prey and having to avoid/fight enemies every time Kappa
[4:14:33] <Khester824> Spooky flavor text
[4:14:33] <akitanito> damn I was hoping the acid took years to work
[4:14:39] <%ThirdWelles> where the fuck is this kid gonna hide for 14 years?

[4:14:58] <%solracc25> where child?
[4:14:59] <@SoFarFetched> I heard arboretum and thought straight to FF14
[4:15:01] <+HayabusaZeroZ> I like the REX shirt Pat
[4:15:05] <%CatastropheCorvid> It's not fighting if you just melt them.
[4:15:11] <BigFingerRo> Pat, you need to shoot more wrestler promos
[4:15:16] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, Prey got so easy after a point I didn't even finish it
[4:15:17] <%Cozy90> does anyone remember the song in SH3 called monochrome night? i feel like once the tension meets its height in that audio that song is about to play
[4:15:18] <%ThirdWelles> It becomes an action game like within the first act with how many resources you get
[4:15:18] <%RealThiele> yea i heard prey and thought Praetorium
[4:15:27] <%moonmintparadise> yeah that actually sounds great
[4:15:29] <%SveriSageAdvice> Saint Mocianne's? @SoFarFetched
[4:15:30] <+GuilKato> but you farm enemies for matterials to craft neuromods I think? like yeah would prefer to feel like making impact on game world
[4:15:32] <corn_dad> Mudman
[4:15:36] <@SoFarFetched> @SveriSageAdvice yes that one
[4:15:36] <BigFingerRo> You need to meet KEEEEIKO in the ARBOREEEEETUM
[4:15:57] <Nelsukako> Pat, one super important question: that just now my big brain resolve to think about does it have tank controls ?
[4:16:02] <+A0N33> Man I'm sure it's been noted before but I just got here and this game really likes that canted angle huh
[4:16:07] <%SveriSageAdvice> love the music in Saint Mocianne's its super chill
[4:16:09] <%JoshManVGH> Time to fight bees!
[4:16:13] <+GhostAnimals> Save Items, love or hate?

[4:16:19] <%RealThiele> it has big tank controls
[4:16:27] <+sileo_patronus> @Nelsukako tank on dpad, free move on stick
[4:16:28] <@SoFarFetched> DEJA VU IVE JUST BEEN IN THIS PLACE BEFORE

[4:16:49] <Nelsukako> @Nelsukako YES, FUCKIN FINALLY
[4:16:55] <%Alig200> what the fuck is a robust lock
[4:17:03] <@SoFarFetched> oops you're too smart pat
[4:17:04] <akitanito> huh
[4:17:09] <Madinki> This is PEAK voice acting theatre.
[4:17:12] <BigFingerRo> @SirGO0SE you go there to meet up with your WOOOOOIFE
[4:17:14] <+HayabusaZeroZ> Man they really like RE1, even brought back Jill's jiggle physics
[4:17:27] <+ArtemisCroc> this game is trying to too hard to be whimsical and quirky, it's odd
[4:17:28] <Nelsukako> i miss you so much tank controls :´)
[4:17:37] <%strakillias> Pat its a master key I think
[4:17:44] <%ValHollaYoloson> You use it like 4 times
[4:17:45] <DJMesoPhunk> chapel, room where the priest was eating soup, room before the stairs down to the generator room
[4:17:45] <%ZephynM> This music makes me think of Resident Evil
[4:17:45] <%Alig200> the key works for every one of those weird doors
[4:17:48] <%strakillias> Has different combo for different dorrs
[4:17:50] <%Birdigalore> shakey shakey
[4:17:53] <DJMesoPhunk> and metald doors on the 2F elevator room
[4:18:04] <BigFingerRo> something about this game looks very 2000s
[4:18:22] <%Deft_Thought> That's a cool key
[4:18:25] <DJMesoPhunk> yep, it works on all of them
[4:18:25] <BigFingerRo> I think it's the specific shade of grimy green and the lighting
[4:18:28] <%Alig200> yeah, it does. I was confused at first too.
[4:18:30] <DJMesoPhunk> that's why it's reconfigurable
[4:18:35] <+polothegreatest> skeleton key
[4:18:36] <BigFingerRo> not a complaint just an observation
[4:18:40] <%RealThiele> Lactancy on hat board LUL
[4:18:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BigFingerRo it does have a oughts feel to it
[4:18:48] <@TheYellowcouch> that's weird key and I respect it
[4:19:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> Do you respect it?
[4:19:25] <madejustforchat> is the hexagon a part of the key?
[4:19:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> or just appreciate it
[4:19:28] <@SoFarFetched> Cause Papa don't preach
[4:19:45] <+polothegreatest> bonk
[4:20:06] <%Faustgesicht> And super not coincidental
[4:20:12] <%anAngryHamster> Priest gone, think about priest... Regret
[4:20:19] <akitanito> how does that key work
[4:20:20] <+holyxgrale> borgir
[4:20:26] <+sileo_patronus> Oh i think i get it
[4:20:29] <%solracc25> fix it
[4:20:43] <%SveriSageAdvice> ohh. i got it
[4:20:43] <%WhereIsWill> these puzzles seem to metal for me LUL
[4:20:43] <%moonmintparadise> different key perhaps ?
[4:20:53] <DJMesoPhunk> so these require some thinking and I had to look up two of them
[4:20:54] <%SveriSageAdvice> no its this key
[4:20:58] <Seyren1986> no, its that one. I've already solved it
[4:20:59] <sydowoodo> The gears be turning
[4:21:04] <teefpal> I mean I liked Ice Pick Games stuff, but there's something about this game that feels off
[4:21:11] <teefpal> the artstyle
[4:21:15] <Seyren1986> it's one of those puzzles where you move the tiles  into other shapes
[4:21:17] <seaechiowai> is this shadow puzzle
[4:21:23] <gtl1220> square hexagon rombus
[4:21:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> not yet
[4:21:32] <%SWFanatic> shadow puzzles
[4:21:54] <@TheYellowcouch> maybe if you go back on time and look at the vase?
[4:21:58] <Uselesswhitenoise> Star, Triangle, Hexagon?
[4:22:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> Square HEX Pentagram
[4:22:05] <%ValHollaYoloson> You had it lol
[4:22:11] <%MajorCrasher> SHADOW PUZZLES
[4:22:12] <%Undenizen> MAN this game is.... gooood.
[4:22:13] <GarettLefebvre> the center is a hexagon
[4:22:13] <%moonmintparadise> ooooooh
[4:22:13] <gtl1220> square hexagon rhombus
[4:22:22] <%Faustgesicht> Oooooooooooh
[4:22:23] <seaechiowai> shotoBrrrt
[4:22:25] <%DashXero> These shapes appear to be bisected.
[4:22:26] <+RAWPowerStudios> Oh man is this a Nancy Drew game? lmao
[4:22:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> The shapes are broken
[4:22:31] <Clyderso> Shabow pussle
[4:22:32] <%PhysicsLB> square hex pent
[4:22:32] <%zarkazeon> triangle square star?
[4:22:33] <DJMesoPhunk> yeah, you had it. the solution is "the vase is broken, and so are the shapes. fix the shapes"
[4:22:36] <%Faustgesicht> Put the shapes back together
[4:22:43] <%moonmintparadise> look at it from above maybe ?   two are hexagons ? Two sides are square ???
[4:22:43] <%PhysicsLB> pentagon for last one
[4:22:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> not x
[4:22:53] <%Undenizen> OH.
[4:22:56] <teefpal> THINK
[4:22:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> PENTAGON FOR THE LAST ONE
[4:23:00] <%retrohazard> 2 triangles make a square
[4:23:00] <%watts121> Number of Sides
[4:23:01] <+MarkGearRex> two triangles make a square, put the shapes back together
[4:23:03] <+meister_popo> last is triangle
[4:23:03] <%DashXero> That's not a rhombus, it's a pentagon
[4:23:04] <Uselesswhitenoise> oh I looked up a guide
[4:23:04] <gtl1220> thats a star, rhombus
[4:23:05] <Clyderso> chat shhh
[4:23:06] <%PhysicsLB> it's a square, a hex, and a pentagon cut in half then the pieces are rearranged
[4:23:06] <akitanito> do you mean the shapes are incomplete?
[4:23:06] <%strakillias> The two triangle can make a square,
[4:23:07] <%Faustgesicht> The top one is a square split in half
[4:23:07] <fatalDestiny> Re-arrange the shapes on the lock into the shapes on the key,
[4:23:08] <Uselesswhitenoise> want the answere?
[4:23:10] <boof_abroad> pat use BRAIN
[4:23:10] <%Mattais88> oh its the shapes cut in hgalf
[4:23:11] <+InuOblivion> fold
[4:23:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> last is pentagon
[4:23:12] <+sileo_patronus> into shapes that are on the key
[4:23:12] <+RAWPowerStudios> It's very important to chat to give only half-answers.
[4:23:13] <%TheWinged7> the symbols on the door ar the shapes cut up @PatStaresAt
[4:23:13] <%SirGO0SE> he doesnt know pepeLaugh
[4:23:14] <%AgniBrandt> You can put two triangles together to make a square
[4:23:15] <%Undenizen> the three symbols are two halves. the halves can be re-arranged into coherant shapes
[4:23:16] <notsoy> count the number of sides
[4:23:16] <teefpal> Put the shapes together
[4:23:16] <+GuilKato> they are halfs of the shape
[4:23:16] <+InuOblivion> fold the shapes
[4:23:19] <%DashXero> The two triangles make a square
[4:23:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt take the shape cut it in half then turn it
[4:23:21] <SomeAsianDood> PepeLaugh
[4:23:21] <$lotharrio> OH! I get it.
[4:23:22] <+ratchetex> the first one is a square cut in half
[4:23:22] <%Piemen99> ooooohhhhh
[4:23:25] <%DashXero> The two rectangles make a hexagon
[4:23:25] <@ssjklyco> The two triangles on the top become a square
[4:23:26] <%Ziegsy> the shapes have been cut in 2, put them together
[4:23:26] <+InuOblivion> FOLD THEM
[4:23:27] <GarettLefebvre> the top make square middle is 6 sided and bottom is 5 sided
[4:23:27] <BackflipCharm> The shapes are broken in pieces and you need to assemble them
[4:23:28] <notsoy> COUNT THE NUMBER OF SIDES
[4:23:31] <%Piemen99> I see it now
[4:23:32] <%RealThiele> he doesnt know about the 3 seashells LUL
[4:23:32] <teefpal> Look at the shapes and put them together
[4:23:33] <rufus2k2> isn't the last one pentagon
[4:23:38] <Dr_Mooose> oohhh
[4:23:38] <boof_abroad> you need to use your imagination v:
[4:23:39] <%solracc25> re align the shapes
[4:23:40] <%DashXero> The Rhombus and triangle make a pentagon
[4:23:40] <%retrohazard> penta
[4:23:41] <AngryAsian5> Pentagon
[4:23:42] <%LymanAl> Not quitre
[4:23:43] <@TheYellowcouch> that's very not obvious
[4:23:43] <%moonmintparadise> OH THAT IS STUPID
[4:23:44] <%PhysicsLB> last one is pentagon
[4:23:47] <fatalDestiny> Not a triangle,
[4:23:47] <%Mattais88> pentagon
[4:23:47] <+NobuuNobuu> not tri
[4:23:48] <%Ziegsy> 1 off
[4:23:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pentagon
[4:23:51] <%cobalt_phoenix_> how is that a triangle people
[4:23:51] <+GuilKato> so like square hex pentagon
[4:23:53] <AngryAsian5> Square, hexagon, pentagon
[4:23:55] <+GuilKato> 5 sides
[4:23:55] <%Bane_Kaikyo> The shapes apove the lock are shapes that are broken with the peices rearranged..... visualive the peices reshaping shapes that match the key
[4:23:57] <boof_abroad> its a pentagon you dorkus
[4:23:59] <%ValHollaYoloson> Not triangle
[4:24:01] <%Piemen99> POINTLY SQUARE
[4:24:02] <akitanito> easier to just draw it I think
[4:24:02] <%SWFanatic> its like twins
[4:24:04] <%TheWinged7> you did it
[4:24:05] <%watts121> a good puzzle
[4:24:06] <gtl1220> @patstaresat pentagon my bad
[4:24:07] <AngryAsian5> Yeah, that's bonkers
[4:24:11] <%JoshManVGH> I dig it
[4:24:12] <%RealThiele> 5, no 3 sir
[4:24:12] <SomeAsianDood> Pat is good at puzzles
[4:24:13] <matsu_me> okay paige
[4:24:14] <@SoFarFetched> BIG thinking geefSmart
[4:24:14] <+kralec> yeah, the last one wasn't cut the same way.. no idea why
[4:24:16] <%Undenizen> that was a VERY abstract clue
[4:24:19] <%PhysicsLB> that one gave my brain a cramp
[4:24:21] <%moonmintparadise> that is streeeeetching it lmap
[4:24:22] <boof_abroad> babies first puzzle v:
[4:24:22] <+polothegreatest> mind scratcher
[4:24:23] <$lotharrio> I kinda liked that one.
[4:24:25] <%JoshManVGH> Neat reusable key mechanic
[4:24:28] <%TheWinged7> i see we found pats new puzzle weakness, shape puzzles
[4:24:28] <%RealThiele> brute smarts
[4:24:29] <seaechiowai> first try
[4:24:31] <%redthebaron> more time travel
[4:24:31] <+MarkGearRex> I played with tangrams a lot as a kid so that was an easy puzzle to spot
[4:24:34] <%solracc25> obtuse but it can be infered
[4:24:37] <%arizenarkana> these puzzles are brain-destroying
[4:24:42] <teefpal> Its a pretty basic puzzle
[4:24:43] <%TungstenViper> that puzzle is dumb...
[4:24:43] <%maskofmichael> More time travel tapes, woo
[4:24:47] <%Undenizen> @lotharrio i like the solution but the clue needs to be way better
[4:24:49] <%PhysicsLB> NEW weakness?
[4:24:50] <%RealThiele> ima count that shape puzzle as another slide puzzle, which pat is weak against
[4:24:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> @TheWinged7 we just need a shape based slide puzzle
[4:24:52] <%Faustgesicht> So how the fuck the human puzzle gonna work?
[4:25:04] <akitanito> I think it would be better if they didn't show the vase
[4:25:11] <%TungstenViper> it's needlessly complicated
[4:25:16] <%JoshManVGH> Time for drugs
[4:25:20] <KahnWick> Yo! Map looks neat!
[4:25:25] <%SWFanatic> poochy?
[4:25:28] <%TungstenViper> @akitanito yes. it was just distracting
[4:25:32] <%RealThiele> hell yeah its Morphine time!
[4:25:32] <%JoshManVGH> Aaaah
[4:25:46] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> The hint was throwing you
[4:25:51] <%PhysicsLB> it lets you know the shapes over the lock are "broken" and should be reassembled
[4:25:58] <%ValHollaYoloson> Some of the hints easily lead to misinterpretations in this game
[4:26:01] <%JoshManVGH> @realthiele Go go drugie rangers!
[4:26:09] <+YourRedDog> "I Was Very Confused: the Life Story of Pat Boivin"
[4:26:16] <Srthunda> I didnt understand that hin either
[4:26:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> There was a hint here...Its gone now
[4:26:25] <seaechiowai> is this silent hill tho
[4:26:29] <DJMesoPhunk> puzzle that can easily be inferred: this is too complicated
[4:26:30] <+SWindleFeD> Don't worry about it
[4:26:32] <%Buzzard42> BEES?
[4:26:38] <akitanito> ????????????
[4:26:39] <Profmcstevie> I thought silent hill was random knowledge of Shakespearean plays
[4:26:43] <DJMesoPhunk> literal nonsense solution "puzzles" in P.T.: MAN IT'S GENIUS
[4:26:46] <%ValHollaYoloson> Like this one
[4:26:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> GOT IT
[4:26:48] <%Undenizen> so circle, pyramid, hexagon?
[4:26:51] <@TheYellowcouch> yeah a note describing how they made the key would have been better. like RE style
[4:26:51] <%JoshManVGH> ooooh got it i th8nk
[4:26:53] <%SirGO0SE> marcianito???
[4:26:54] <GarettLefebvre> Egyptian is triangle

[4:27:06] <akitanito> ufo pyramid and beehives?
[4:27:06] <Tunamanguy> theres only one shakespeare puzzle in the series, its just really hard
[4:27:06] <Uselesswhitenoise> its just shapes
[4:27:07] <GarettLefebvre> Alien star
[4:27:10] <%TungstenViper> YES
[4:27:12] <%TungstenViper> LUL

[4:28:14] <%ValHollaYoloson> YUP
[4:28:14] <%RealThiele> he did it?
[4:28:14] <Srthunda> that hint was useless
[4:28:15] <%Piemen99> BULLSHIT
[4:28:17] <%TungstenViper> that was actually a better puzzle
[4:28:18] <%ZephynM> So this game must be a homage to classic RE?
[4:28:19] <+polothegreatest> S T A R S
[4:28:21] <%cooldude69xx> *hint
[4:28:27] <%arizenarkana> OKAY THAT's STUPID IT SHOULD'VE BEEN SAUCER
[4:28:30] <teefpal> Yeah these aren't tough yet
[4:28:35] <%Faustgesicht> wierd
[4:28:36] <%JoshManVGH> New pages?
[4:28:39] <boof_abroad> alien come from stars, Egyptians from pyramids and bees from hexagons
[4:28:46] <%ValHollaYoloson> I thought crop circle
[4:28:46] <teefpal> They only require one logical leap
[4:28:46] <%Paperware> Man these puzzles seem less hard and more stupid
[4:28:48] <%ZephynM> I just finished replacing the faceplate to my Xbox controller with a Wood Grain looking cover. It's so nice.
[4:28:50] <+Shiso666> it adds to the letter
[4:29:03] <blue8moon> cattle prod?
[4:29:04] <%watts121> how does she know that?!?!?
[4:29:04] <%PhysicsLB> capacitors rule
[4:29:08] <akitanito> but aliens technically come from other planets
[4:29:14] <boof_abroad> they have some stupid point and click logic to them xD
[4:29:22] <%Archphronimos> like... like a tazer?
[4:29:25] <GarettLefebvre> Now where was the battery charger again?
[4:29:27] <Srthunda> excitement

[4:29:42] <tanarath> cattle prod
[4:30:09] <KahnWick> Okay, this legit looks kinda good
[4:30:23] <%RealThiele> for $20 its pretty good
[4:30:34] <+Lulu19> the chars face looks awful but the rest of this looks real good
[4:30:50] <%ValHollaYoloson> Agreed
[4:30:52] <notsoy> tetris lmfao
[4:30:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> wow, better than The Medium? Kappa
[4:30:58] <Dr_Mooose> we tetris now
[4:30:58] <%Faustgesicht> Got it
[4:31:00] <G03933> thats an unfortunately low bar though
[4:31:03] <%SirGO0SE> this is p great yea
[4:31:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> that one is EASY
[4:31:06] <%PhysicsLB> yarp
[4:31:07] <%TungstenViper> despite the main character looking like a shitlord
[4:31:10] <%AzureGale> lol Tetris
[4:31:10] <%ValHollaYoloson> Yup
[4:31:12] <teefpal> @RealThiele Oh I thought this was a $60 game
[4:31:15] <shambarino> ez pz
[4:31:15] <GarettLefebvre> first try
[4:31:18] <%RealThiele> oh ok
[4:31:18] <Srthunda> okay, this hint was actually good
[4:31:18] <rufus2k2> WHY ARE THOSE DIAGRAMS THERE
[4:31:21] <%arizenarkana> it really captures the old school feel, for better and for worse
[4:31:21] <%DashXero> By Jove! He's got it.
[4:31:23] <@TheYellowcouch> i do love reading chat and seeing people wildly swing from this sucks to this rules
[4:31:25] <gtl1220> ya pat
[4:31:30] <smugjorgen98> what RE game is this
[4:31:38] <%LymanAl> Get vaccinated!
[4:31:40] <%cooldude69xx> Get vaccinated everybody!
[4:31:43] <teefpal> This looks good for a budget horror title, nothing original but it's solid looking
[4:31:43] <boof_abroad> M A T H
[4:31:49] <DartAran> Compare to say The Medium
[4:31:53] <+marino1x88> @TheYellowcouch x2
[4:31:53] <%LymanAl> Take your horse shot
[4:31:54] <+Lulu19> man I still love watching old shit storms, you guys played a ton of trash re knock offs
[4:31:58] <%Deft_Thought> Whatever happened to that phone game styled like Silent Hill?
[4:31:58] <notsoy> lolll
[4:31:59] <%RealThiele> @RealThiele yea $20 on steam its a good pickup
[4:32:00] <%ValHollaYoloson> This one is weird, but once it clicks, it clicks
[4:32:04] <%cooldude69xx> @TheYellowcouch Its a rare kind of game that does both
[4:32:04] <boof_abroad> I am fully vaxxed!
[4:32:08] <akitanito> gameplay and look is good, puzzles could be better
[4:32:08] <%RetroCop87> how controversial
[4:32:12] <%Faustgesicht> AM
[4:32:13] <smugjorgen98> im waiting for my second shot
[4:32:13] <%Deft_Thought> This was from way back. You played it on the old channel

[4:36:46] <%RealThiele> Vampire vending
[4:36:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Dang pat when did you get into Yarnham
[4:36:49] <teefpal> The fight music makes me feel like there's devil trigger/juggling mechanics
[4:36:53] <crassletter> it's enough to make a a man sick
[4:36:55] <smugjorgen98> is this game horror game version of RE
[4:37:01] <danteftw20> the sweet smell of bludd, it's enough to make a man sick
[4:37:06] <seaechiowai> TPFufun
[4:37:10] <%Alig200> @PatStaresAt did you do the one in the east wing corridor, near where Caroline woke up?
[4:37:13] <+Lulu19> pc, one day. Believe
[4:37:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt BLOOD BORNE FOR PC
[4:37:16] <@Jekado> patch it to LOCK IT HARDER
[4:37:19] <%RealThiele> Fear the old blood, BECAUSE HERE COMES NEW BLOOD: A
[4:37:20] <+kralec> or a PC release...
[4:37:26] <%Deft_Thought> Even a PS5 port with unlocked framerate would be great
[4:37:26] <%CatastropheCorvid> It needs to come to PC.
[4:37:28] <%WhereIsWill> i cant believe its gotten NOTHING
[4:37:32] <GarettLefebvre> this is almost feeling like Myst now
[4:37:45] <%cooldude69xx> @Jekado 15 FPS at bestt dammit!
[4:37:46] <%Alig200> lol sorry, I stepped out for a few seconds and must've missed it lmao
[4:38:00] <TheLocalRival> Pat what’re your thoughts on NXT getting murdered by Vince McMahon
[4:38:03] <Jackswift23> Was in Prison for the last 4 years can someone tell me Whats happened to the zaibatsu
[4:38:04] <akitanito> pat's blocking the clue lol
[4:38:16] <%ValHollaYoloson> This is a troll
[4:38:18] <%Dakuu75> I would never get past all these without a guide.\
[4:38:27] <%watts121> it's not 8
[4:38:27] <+Gregmeyer> infinity
[4:38:28] <%cobalt_phoenix_> infinity
[4:38:29] <%watts121> it's infinity
[4:38:29] <+MagicMongoose> infinite
[4:38:29] <+Fidranth> pat its sideays
[4:38:29] <%LymanAl> Infibite
[4:38:30] <+kralec> infinite
[4:38:30] <smugjorgen98> infinte
[4:38:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt NOT 8 INFINITE
[4:38:30] <%rkbinder> it has infinite
[4:38:31] <%redthebaron> infinite
[4:38:31] <%PhysicsLB> INFINITY
[4:38:31] <Dr_Mooose> I mean
[4:38:32] <%cobalt_phoenix_> it's sideways
[4:38:32] <akitanito> it's not 8
[4:38:33] <%Blackmage9999> infintiy
[4:38:34] <%Crookedspiral> it's an infinity symbol
[4:38:34] <brovietto> it's sideways, so infinity
[4:38:35] <Clyderso> Nice
[4:38:35] <%AncelDeLambert> it's teh infinity symbol, dingus
[4:38:37] <%Dakuu75> depends on the resolution
[4:38:37] <%ValHollaYoloson> It’s not 8
[4:38:37] <Profmcstevie> 8 sideways
[4:38:37] <akitanito> they were on the side
[4:38:43] <%Faustgesicht> That's not bad
[4:38:44] <SomeAsianDood> it's not 8 pat it's on the side
[4:38:47] <@SoFarFetched> "this game is too smart for me"
[4:38:48] <%SirGO0SE> :O
[4:38:54] <%drflatface> drflatface subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! infinity dingus
[4:38:57] <zerointelligence000> these puzzles are cool
[4:38:58] <%cobalt_phoenix_> of all the key puzzles that's the best
[4:39:02] <%watts121> gotta say the enemies are hilarious
[4:39:03] <seaechiowai> rustled my jimmies
[4:39:03] <+Plaguemelon> my brain is gonna explode
[4:39:04] <%zarkazeon> 3+5+0
[4:39:10] <akitanito> that puzzle was good
[4:39:33] <Saltmeisterr> AUGHH
[4:39:37] <%The_Protagonist> BONK
[4:39:41] <%Monkeyweed21> why is pat so good at fighting  crippled people?
[4:39:59] <boof_abroad> I dunno how I feel about beating up these poor crippled gremlins v:
[4:40:00] <MaledictusXCII> way better puzzles than village
[4:40:03] <%maskofmichael> @Monkeyweed21 Paige taught him well
[4:40:04] <%The_Protagonist> @Monkeyweed21 because he fights one in his home every day
[4:40:05] <Saltmeisterr> why do these monsters sound like Arnie?
[4:40:10] <%Faustgesicht> Crippled people are weak to shotgun rounds
[4:40:19] <+InuOblivion> that was 2 extra hits
[4:40:21] <+sileo_patronus> @Monkeyweed21 do what you know
[4:40:22] <akitanito> and they move fast enough you can't really juke them
[4:40:24] <BigFingerRo> @Monkeyweed21 Pat "If they're in traction, they're a distraction" Boivin
[4:40:32] <Lynxystem> these reload animations are weirdly satisfying, lol
[4:40:35] <SomeAsianDood> that makes sense @Faustgesicht
[4:40:36] <seaechiowai> @monkeyweed21 because pat plays DRK
[4:40:36] <KahnWick> I might just buy this now, its like the best SH since 4 (or Origins IMO)
[4:40:42] <%ValHollaYoloson> With how tight all of these corridors are, it demands you kill them
[4:40:59] <@SoFarFetched> PAPA DON'T BLEED
[4:41:00] <akitanito> how he's alive
[4:41:03] <%redthebaron> i musr
[4:41:04] <boof_abroad> crippled people take up too much of the hallway v:
[4:41:06] <SomeAsianDood> I think he's missing an arm
[4:41:09] <%DashXero> I thought he couldn's see any of this shit?
[4:41:09] <AoiRob> v o i c e a c t i n g
[4:41:10] <@Jekado> he seems fairly okay considering
[4:41:11] <notsoy> i think these voiceovers were intentionally done as badly as possible lmao
[4:41:12] <%Buzzard42> this acting feels appropriate for a RE love letter
[4:41:14] <%greasypete00> let the villain die
[4:41:15] <%AzureGale> Oh got she's got blood all over the soles of her boots
[4:41:18] <ShiningAxis> use shotgun and put him out of his misery
[4:41:18] <@Jekado> like he should be in shock
[4:41:19] <%Undenizen> I'm glad they kept old horror game style voice acting.
[4:41:21] <OtakuSnake1> Gotta give him a hand, eh?
[4:41:23] <+RAWPowerStudios> Who calls their dad "Father!"
[4:41:25] <Saltmeisterr> wait why is her dad here?
[4:41:26] <%Bane_Kaikyo> evul
[4:41:27] <%Hilleltaco> Pour the blood into his stump, it'll come right back SeemsGood
[4:41:27] <+Demerson13> YOU GOTTA FIND THE SERUM
[4:41:28] <bleugh> badmin
[4:41:31] <%watts121> Silent Hill room
[4:41:32] <akitanito> maybe he was really a good guy
[4:41:32] <matsu_me> He seems nice to me :)
[4:41:39] <+RAWPowerStudios> Who addresses their dad like that?
[4:41:40] <+GuilKato> light candles?
[4:41:42] <chaos2frozen> @RAWPowerStudios as in Priest "father"
[4:41:44] <$lotharrio> Help him by stabbing his heart out, so he stops bleeding. That's lateral thinking.
[4:41:45] <+RAWPowerStudios> Is that the final boss?
[4:41:46] <%AzureGale> Father as in priest, not actual dad
[4:41:46] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @RAWPowerStudios Not her dad.... He's a priest
[4:41:48] <%GalacticaPhanto> Father as in priest
[4:41:49] <%PhysicsLB> i like the lighting here
[4:41:52] <%JoshManVGH> I don't know if filling him with Vending Machine blood truly counts as "helping"
[4:41:54] <%watts121> CATTLE PROD
[4:41:55] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> @RAWPowerStudios because he is a priest not her father
[4:41:56] <zerointelligence000> he'll grow it back when he activates the t virus I bet
[4:41:57] <crassletter> red haring?
[4:42:00] <+RAWPowerStudios> OHHHHHHH!!!!! I thought it was legit bad voice acting.
[4:42:00] <Astrophizz> same thing
[4:42:01] <+aerora__> What's the feel on the game so far? Good? Bad?
[4:42:02] <%JoshManVGH> You don't know that!
[4:42:04] <%Bluwizard21> and that means what?
[4:42:04] <Saltmeisterr> oh
[4:42:07] <%Faustgesicht> Holy shit that's a weapon
[4:42:08] <GarettLefebvre> can you light those candles?
[4:42:11] <bleugh> priest daddy
[4:42:11] <%Undenizen> is your character catholic?
[4:42:13] <+GuilKato> are there candles by mirror
[4:42:15] <+RAWPowerStudios> Voice acting/writing.
[4:42:17] <Srthunda> what, you dont call your local preist daddy?
[4:42:19] <%Bluwizard21> like priest dont fuck. especially in shit like this
[4:42:20] <time2getsweaty> Did you see the FTC in the U.S. is investigating McDonalds and as to why their ice-cream machines are always broken
[4:42:24] <+gheremy84> So.. her father?
[4:42:24] <+GuilKato> ahhh
[4:42:36] <%SpaceHobo55> If he isnt her dead why does she call him father? Kappa
[4:42:50] <Profmcstevie> FTC said where's my McFlurry
[4:42:51] <%shadowace2400> it's because they never clean them?
[4:42:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> THERE IS NO MYSTERY ITS PATENT BULLSHIT
[4:42:55] <Goatllama> everyone calls him daddy
[4:42:56] <+Lulu19> yea
[4:42:58] <+kralec> They are investigating if the contract is illegal in anyway
[4:42:58] <%redthebaron> we have a tape also
[4:42:59] <%cooldude69xx> Oh man, that shits never actually broken
[4:43:04] <%Alig200> kinda want a McFlurry now
[4:43:07] <%Undenizen> yeah there was an expose. but as far as i'm aware nothing they're doing is illegal. it's really dumb.
[4:43:09] <%maskofmichael> I thought it was to clean the machine?
[4:43:11] <akitanito> they also need to go through pasteurization process which takes forever
[4:43:16] <%JoshManVGH> I had been told by employees that it's always "broken ca
[4:43:18] <%PhysicsLB> LUL
[4:43:19] <%shadowace2400> I always assumed it was because they never bother to clean them, because MY mcdonalds one always seems to work
[4:43:19] <cherrycottontail> there's also a lawsuit against the manufacturor over right to repair
[4:43:20] <%Faustgesicht> Anti-trustee right-to-repair shenagans
[4:43:21] <+condemned_15> the self cleaning function takes 4 hours
[4:43:21] <%CalderGaming> yeah the machine manufacturer monopolizes the tools needed to fix it
[4:43:22] <seaechiowai> there is a Father, Sister, and Brother in Christianity but no cousins or nephews
[4:43:22] <+GuilKato> get the priest a new arm!
[4:43:33] <%GalacticaPhanto> @cooldude69xx No it's actually broken, just by literal design
[4:43:33] <%JoshManVGH> broken because nobody wants to take the time to clean it
[4:43:36] <%linSP> lot of people think the manufacturers on those machines make them so shitty so they stay in business of fixing them
[4:43:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @shadowace2400 no because the machines have a contract that can't be fixed by anyone but the repair company
[4:43:38] <boof_abroad> give him a hand!
[4:43:39] <+kralec> Monopoly or racketeering or SOMETHING.
[4:43:40] <%AzureGale> Hey what is your opinion on Warner Brothers making Ultra Instinct Shaggy canon
[4:43:53] <Jaxiis0> I thought it was just an excuse employees gave. I never legit thought they were broken
[4:43:55] <%Dakuu75> fast food chains, like the individual busieness, can't buy equipment from anyone other than their company
[4:43:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @shadowace2400 which actually goes against "right of repair" laws
[4:44:00] <%Raikouija> @caldergaming sounds like the John Deere tractor bullshit all over again
[4:44:00] <%AzureGale> It's almost as if she's wearing a dress for a reason Lx
[4:44:01] <%Piemen99> NICE
[4:44:03] <+kralec> not in "good faith" abusive practices, something is wrong in that scenario
[4:44:04] <%Undenizen> @maskofmichael yes and no. the maintenance company that works on them is doing some weird exploitation shit
[4:44:05] <crassletter> quick look up her skirt!
[4:44:09] <%maskofmichael> @AzureGale Killed the meme
[4:44:18] <seaechiowai> @azuregale that sounds like bs but i believe it
[4:44:34] <%cooldude69xx> @GalacticaPhanto I worked at one for six years. Sometimes the machines are just fine and making the cones is a pain in the ass
[4:44:36] <gtl1220> @patstaresat think wholly's n-pass but with a mcicecream
[4:44:43] <%SWFanatic> darkwood map still haunts me
[4:44:43] <%ValHollaYoloson> 100%
[4:44:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its the same bullshit that apple tries to do with cellphone repairs
[4:44:55] <Samhotdamn> How do you like the game so far?
[4:45:09] <+GuilKato> you do have car battery for teh cherry picker in the upstairs
[4:45:16] <akitanito> eww
[4:45:23] <%Dakuu75> SEWER LEVEL, YO~!
[4:45:23] <%GalacticaPhanto> they really made her hips move hard in her walking animation eh
[4:45:24] <seaechiowai> @cooldude69xx I used to go to micky d and would get just one ice cream
[4:45:29] <%PhysicsLB> this some silent hill shit right here
[4:45:33] <BigFingerRo> @Samhotdamn seems like the patster likes it
[4:45:38] <+Lulu19> no door transitions smh
[4:45:42] <+sileo_patronus> and then a skeleton jumped out
[4:45:46] <akitanito> I guess there's a doll arm somewhere
[4:45:49] <%Dakuu75> that's some Dr. Who shit, right there~
[4:45:52] <@SoFarFetched> ARE WE GONNA HAVE A FACEOFF?
[4:45:53] <@SoFarFetched> PogChamp
[4:45:55] <%cooldude69xx> @seaechiowai They're really better than they have any right to be
[4:45:59] <%southern_coyote> southern_coyote subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[4:46:01] <zerointelligence000> chase sequence I bet
[4:46:07] <%AzureGale> A Face/Off?
[4:46:11] <+MagicMongoose> the music putting me on edge
[4:46:13] <%Raikouija> Stop talking about faceoff!!
[4:46:16] <%SirGO0SE> did someone say FACE/OFF?
[4:46:18] <%LymanAl> knife
[4:46:24] <akitanito> I'm just totally guessing wildly tho
[4:46:24] <boof_abroad> its probably in that hand storage
[4:46:25] <seaechiowai> they are great and I am sorry I made mcslaves suffer
[4:46:26] <Jaxiis0> wait... is this like Silent Hill Origins, where you switch between normal and nightmare world via mirrors?
[4:46:30] <@Jekado> yee FACE/OFF
[4:46:32] <%GalacticaPhanto> they're really trying to emulate Akira Yamoka
[4:46:34] <gtl1220> try where the cooler was
[4:46:35] <%preeeow> Got in late, how's pat liking it?
[4:46:35] <crassletter> ma, this girl has some powers
[4:46:35] <%maskofmichael> OFFFACE!?
[4:46:37] <%Monkeyweed21> rope
[4:46:39] <tanarath> I really need to see FACE/OFF
[4:46:39] <%Deft_Thought> Man, this place sucks
[4:46:50] <%ValHollaYoloson> Yes you do
[4:46:54] <Parapattern> MONKE
[4:46:54] <+MarkGearRex> Can you not knife the rope?
[4:46:54] <+GuilKato> you have scalple cant you cut rope?
[4:46:58] <+GuilKato> on the guilatine
[4:47:06] <DJMesoPhunk> yeah you've got what you need for the guillotine
[4:47:06] <+GhostAnimals> This is supposed to be a hospital but I haven't seen Jello ONCE
[4:47:08] <%Monkeyweed21> the rope
[4:47:10] <%PhysicsLB> Ass hammer?
[4:47:11] <+Lulu19> OH NO
[4:47:22] <seaechiowai> guillotine?
[4:47:22] <Profmcstevie> Man Resi with multiple item menus sure is comfortable
[4:47:22] <Rubri> I seriously got here because someone linked me "IS BLUUUD" for like the billionth time and I got curious and the first thing I hear is "What's that smell" and I am waiting this ten minutes to say I am okay with this.
[4:47:29] <%Sigma_190_Beta> @GuilKato Have you ever tried to use a scalpel on anything but skin? It's bad.
[4:47:37] <+Lulu19> Dad?
[4:47:41] <AngryAsian5> Well now....
[4:47:49] <akitanito> there was candleholder next to the door
[4:47:57] <TOONFOOD> intense scare unit
[4:47:58] <northendendro> @patstaresat what are your thoughts on the rumoured new silent hill game?
[4:48:02] <%cooldude69xx> @GuilKato The scalpel was already used for a rope cutting obstacle tho
[4:48:11] <akitanito> one more on the other side
[4:48:16] <+GhostAnimals> Is there some Light/Dark mechanic to this game that I missed out on?
[4:48:18] <+Lulu19> beat his ass
[4:48:37] <leinadtonu> eat shit monsty
[4:48:42] <+sileo_patronus> @GhostAnimals pitch dark kills you
[4:48:44] <%Faustgesicht> @GhostAnimals dark kills you in 5 seconds
[4:48:44] <@SoFarFetched> be sure to  drink your morphine
[4:48:46] <%AzureGale> Where does Caroline get her clothes? Been wandering this hospitalmansion for hours and despite being cut like a hundred times they're still immaculate
[4:48:46] <Profmcstevie> the mechanic is "being in pitch dark will kill you"
[4:48:49] <%Alig200> @GhostAnimals you cant attack in the dark, and staying in it too long will kill you.
[4:48:49] <%Raikouija> Bonk him reall good!
[4:48:55] <%LymanAl> 20/20
[4:48:58] <leinadtonu> they just hangin'
[4:48:58] <+GhostAnimals> Ahh, fair enough
[4:49:33] <+GuilKato> but you still have scalpel @Sigma_190_Beta so though use it on the guiliteine to make drop blade
[4:49:33] <%cooldude69xx> @AzureGale Dante gave her his tailors number
[4:49:36] <+aRealBaboon> So hows this game so far, im curious about it
[4:49:42] <akitanito> I was expecting super glue, oh
[4:49:42] <Uselesswhitenoise> lmao
[4:49:45] <olm46> That's great
[4:49:46] <%Faustgesicht> Oops
[4:49:47] <Uselesswhitenoise> crazy glue it
[4:49:48] <boof_abroad> nail it in
[4:49:51] <%strakillias> need glue or somethin
[4:50:03] <Rubri> Blood glue
[4:50:06] <akitanito> you can't hammer without nail
[4:50:08] <matsu_me> put some gamer goo on it
[4:50:08] <notsoy> glue or tape?
[4:50:08] <+MarkGearRex> need some duct tape
[4:50:10] <Seyren1986> nail it on lol
[4:50:11] <$lotharrio> Padlock?
[4:50:12] <zerointelligence000> duct tape
[4:50:29] <gtl1220> god thats funny as shit
[4:50:33] <%PhysicsLB> there's a nail in the top of the hammer?
[4:50:41] <$lotharrio> Oh yeah, wait... the nail gun?
[4:50:42] <Rubri> Yo that is the most country ass hammer I've seen. Has the nail in the head to tighten the grip and everything
[4:50:44] <%Faustgesicht> love it pathetically flops off
[4:50:49] <BappoTheMighty> Whoa, this game looks lit!
[4:50:58] <akitanito> makes too much sense
[4:50:58] <Phats_Mahoney> just use the hammer to get the nail out of itself
[4:51:01] <%Deft_Thought> Shoot the arm with your shotgun
[4:51:01] <BappoTheMighty> Also, hello today everyone!
[4:51:02] <+kralec> well that's the electric lance..
[4:51:05] <%Deft_Thought> Clearly
[4:51:10] <Rubri> That's a thing that carpetners used to do so they didn't have to buy a new hammer
[4:51:14] <akitanito> can you combine?
[4:51:14] <tanarath> Randomly combine shit?
[4:51:16] <+RAWPowerStudios> Medical bandage?
[4:51:17] <%zarkazeon> use knife on guillotine??
[4:51:20] <boof_abroad> imagine the father guy in the real world just constantly growing and loosing the hand out of nowhere:b
[4:51:20] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the guillotine has a rope
[4:51:27] <Rubri> They'd just ram a nail in the top with something else as a psuedo hammer that way it tightens it up
[4:51:37] <%ValHollaYoloson> Guillotine
[4:51:39] <%ValHollaYoloson> Yes
[4:51:47] <%LymanAl> stream blindness is real
[4:51:57] <%Piemen99> pssf Y'all wanna see my hammer Knife?
[4:52:01] <AngryAsian5> For sure
[4:52:12] <Nelsukako> is this a good thing ?
[4:52:18] <teefpal> There's nothing so far that's blown me away
[4:52:20] <%Raikouija> ^
[4:52:21] <%SirGO0SE> and it had the audacity to open with booba
[4:52:23] <Parapattern> I do admire its audacity
[4:52:34] <%SWFanatic> this door is painted on!

[4:52:50] <%ValHollaYoloson> It tries very hard, overall for its benefit, but sometimes it’s a bit much
[4:52:50] <@Moobot> @JoshManVGH I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 53m.
[4:52:51] <+GuilKato> wooo!
[4:53:06] <+KingNoodleWalrus> Hullo friends, I hope your day has been better thank mine. I got t-boned while driving to work today and my car is totaled. Luckily I and the person who hit me are fine, but I've got no car now
[4:53:09] <teefpal> @PhysicsLB hope so
[4:53:12] <%strakillias> I'm amazed that items can be more than single use in this type of game. Its breaking new ground
[4:53:17] <Uselesswhitenoise> the essence of game
[4:53:20] <YeeZaurus> thing and thing accessories
[4:53:32] <$lotharrio> Jeez that sucks yeah.
[4:53:35] <teefpal> @KingNoodleWalrus shit, thank god you're ok physically

[4:53:56] <%PhysicsLB> that's the important part
[4:53:56] <+KingNoodleWalrus> @KingNoodleWalrus yeh
[4:53:57] <%ValHollaYoloson> Damn, glad you’re okay
[4:53:58] <%cooldude69xx> @KingNoodleWalrus Damn man, you're the third one in the stream. Hope you're okay
[4:53:59] <%AzureGale> @KingNoodleWalrus nyannScary
[4:54:11] <Uselesswhitenoise> do you ever think about how many of the people that watch you could have died without you ever knowing

[4:56:12] <@SoFarFetched> @Uselesswhitenoise there actually was someone who tweeted out to Pat,Paige and a couple other youtubers/streamers  because they were the relative of a viewer who passed away recently. Cause they wanted to let them know that the deceased viewer really enjoyed their content.
[4:56:25] <+KingNoodleWalrus> Yeah, I took the day off work today and tomorrow so I could have a 4 day weekend to chill and relax. maybe going to see a doctor as I've got some lingering weakness in my left arm.

[4:57:42] <%Raikouija> Bork
[4:57:51] <notsoy> i don't know whether i do or don't want the stapler to be the answer to the arm
[4:57:56] <akitanito> would the real father also have staples in his arm?

[4:59:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> is this ...text to speach?
[4:59:37] <%Faustgesicht> Yo
[4:59:38] <$lotharrio> Sometimes she talks like she's a text to speech bot.
[4:59:38] <Essixian> LOOK at THIS
[4:59:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> this voice acting couldn't be more wooden
[4:59:42] <akitanito> you don't need to hold lighter anymore
[4:59:43] <shycommando> YOOOOOOO
[4:59:43] <Essixian> WHat do you THINK of IT
[4:59:43] <AngryAsian5> God this is some resident evil ass acting LUL
[4:59:44] <%SirGO0SE> what if the actress is really good  but the director told them sound amateurish
[4:59:50] <%logoth_> There must be a back DOOR somewhere. Let's try to FIND IT first shall we
[4:59:50] <+InuOblivion> big power
[4:59:51] <%ValHollaYoloson> Yup
[4:59:52] <+sileo_patronus> YO
[4:59:54] <+Lionkevinson> Robot voice acting?
[4:59:56] <%Alig200> its already equipped
[4:59:57] <Clyderso> its on
[4:59:58] <%Sigma_190_Beta> No...
[5:00:01] <%Deft_Thought> It's already on you
[5:00:01] <%Sigma_190_Beta> It's on.
[5:00:01] <TheNewZealandStory> are the writing and voice acting suppose to be really awkward and bad
[5:00:01] <+MagicMongoose> you already are
[5:00:02] <BigFingerRo> @Essixian what do you think of it?
[5:00:03] <%PhysicsLB> it's auto equipped
[5:00:04] <akitanito> you are already using it
[5:00:04] <teefpal> @SirGO0SE An Other M situation?
[5:00:04] <boof_abroad> its on
[5:00:08] <DoubleRrico> re pocket flashlight!
[5:00:09] <%Sigma_190_Beta> It's already equiplled.
[5:00:10] <%ValHollaYoloson> It’s on already
[5:00:10] <crassletter> ....pat
[5:00:11] <%logoth_> The silent hill light
[5:00:14] <tanarath> IT'S JUST THERE
[5:00:18] <+InuOblivion> no more running
[5:00:21] <%strakillias> NOW THEY WILL FEAR YOU
[5:00:26] <%retrohazard> the flashlight casts a shadow BEHIND you lol
[5:00:29] <%Raikouija> Sweet!
[5:00:31] <%arcaderabbit48> Yeah, so that mechanic is over now I guess
[5:00:32] <akitanito> you can go back to the otherworld and kill the wall monster
[5:00:36] <+Prism_Zet> what this
[5:00:38] <%Alig200> @TheNewZealandStory eh, its a $20 indie game, I personally think its forgiveable.
[5:00:39] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Time to Rip and tear
[5:00:39] <+silentblast93> is the silent hill?
[5:00:40] <+Prism_Zet> shadows seem insane
[5:00:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Que "The only thing they fear is you"
[5:00:48] <+sileo_patronus> @PatStaresAt how long til you lose that light somehow?
[5:01:01] <%arcaderabbit48> Or the batteries die
[5:01:19] <+sileo_patronus> fair
[5:01:22] <%arcaderabbit48> Okay no seriously, this is fucking Silent Hill. And its great
[5:01:25] <Uncle_Bandit> Howdy! uncleb55Hausen
[5:01:33] <teefpal> What if you did this without a light?
[5:01:44] <+Prism_Zet> the character design is pretty cute, but this screams budget at me, neat monsters too at least
[5:01:47] <+sileo_patronus> @teefpal can't
[5:01:49] <DJMesoPhunk> you can't attack in the darkness
[5:01:50] <+Left_Justified> atpTopSpeed
[5:01:53] <DJMesoPhunk> so you can't
[5:01:54] <TheNewZealandStory> @TheNewZealandStory i wont forgive it
[5:01:56] <Rubri> What in the ever living
[5:01:56] <Srthunda> I do like these monster sounds
[5:02:01] <FstSergeant8595> @Prism_Zet same
[5:02:03] <%SWFanatic> caution, high voltage
[5:02:08] <+silentblast93> why is crippled wolverine attacking you pat?
[5:02:13] <Rubri> Resident Evil 4 and Silent Hill had a horrendous love child apparently
[5:02:13] <teefpal> lame
[5:02:19] <%PhysicsLB> acquire tazer
[5:02:24] <+Prism_Zet> better wheelchair monster than silent hill lol
[5:02:24] <gtl1220> quickly, feed your addiction to heal yourself pat
[5:02:30] <%arcaderabbit48> @silentblast93 Because he is mad that Pat is taller than him
[5:02:30] <Clyderso> nop
[5:02:31] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> yeah
[5:02:32] <%PhysicsLB> just a tad
[5:02:34] <%LymanAl> I like the cut of this game's gib
[5:02:36] <%Faustgesicht> With that flashlight now, yeah
[5:02:37] <%Cozy90> cuming
[5:02:40] <Profmcstevie> My understanding is it's an 8-10 game
[5:02:41] <teefpal> It seems really short if the game is already over.
[5:02:42] <+jojo_abob> kinda
[5:02:45] <shycommando> 50-60%
[5:02:46] <%arcaderabbit48> More like the turning point, maybe?
[5:02:46] <akitanito> cattle proddd
[5:02:46] <DartAran> End of area, maybe
[5:02:48] <%TheWinged7> healthkit
[5:02:49] <%strakillias> Now that you picked that up I do

[5:03:16] <%Faustgesicht> That flashlight is  a "clean up loose ends" items
[5:03:18] <sydowoodo> Isn't that a med kit???
[5:03:25] <%JoshManVGH> this is cool ahit
[5:03:30] <%SirGO0SE> yes pls
[5:03:34] <+Prism_Zet> silent hill the decent budget ripoff?
[5:03:34] <Profmcstevie> It's basically Halloween already right
[5:03:35] <%ValHollaYoloson> It’s a good game for what it is
[5:03:41] <+SWindleFeD> "Hey, it's that medkit!"
[5:03:55] <%TheWinged7> but you hate mgronalds
[5:03:56] <%PhysicsLB> this game is nailing the ambience
[5:04:25] <%JoshManVGH> I like it when you influencer types play these scary games, then I don't have to and still get to see the cool shit!
[5:04:36] <+SWindleFeD> Man I would even take McDonalds if it was the only place open, fuck this lockdown
[5:04:39] <%PhysicsLB> same
[5:04:39] <leinadtonu> I was convinced you hated mcronalds
[5:04:44] <+Prism_Zet> i can't tell if its the game or pat's stream, but its stuttery a bit for me
[5:04:46] <huetitle> When was the last time Pat saved?
[5:04:50] <%Broand> 4 french fries were deposited into your mcdonalds affiliate account
[5:04:58] <%Undenizen> i liked when mcdonalds workers tried to unionize and they called it a McStrike
[5:05:00] <FstSergeant8595> Pat why would you play this when you could be playing The Medium Kappa
[5:05:14] <%Faustgesicht> Test out new gun?
[5:05:17] <+Prism_Zet> wow that item noise sounds like sh lol
[5:05:26] <%PhysicsLB> hahaha his butt is hanging out
[5:05:32] <%Undenizen> it's VERY goofy that they do a backflip when you hit em
[5:05:36] <tanarath> the boi
[5:05:37] <%Seyren1986> what is that thing? a zipgun?
[5:05:57] <akitanito> a cattle prod
[5:05:58] <%AzureGale> It's a nailgun
[5:06:01] <+HeroSolaire> What is that butt pillow? Is pat having pain in the tailbone?
[5:06:04] <leinadtonu> dying like a power rangers villain
[5:06:05] <gtl1220> @seyren1986 yes
[5:06:06] <otakon17> pipe shotgun
[5:06:12] <otakon17> the one above it is a nailgun
[5:06:16] <BlackStarAura> The baby
[5:06:25] <otakon17> ze babee
[5:06:43] <keithcreuser> Does game use the zapping system?
[5:06:56] <FstSergeant8595> This game captures the RE and SH spirit very well while simultaneously being "off". Like its almost uncanny.
[5:06:58] <Lynxystem> chwKEK
[5:06:58] <%SWFanatic> does zangief use the zapping system?
[5:07:05] <leinadtonu> Is Zangief dealig drugs?
[5:07:05] <teefpal> Oh no, Gief has gone over the deep end
[5:07:16] <%Bluwizard21> Zangeif is the zapping system
[5:07:19] <GarettLefebvre> D-pad quick select would be a game changer
[5:07:20] <akitanito> giefing system
[5:07:20] <keithcreuser> zangief zappin around big time
[5:07:22] <leinadtonu> *dealing

[5:19:53] <notsoy> RE's shotguns didn't quite diminish how scary it could get
[5:19:58] <+Prism_Zet> shotguns are classic horror weapons man
[5:20:00] <tanarath> How could that monster kill itself?
[5:20:00] <%Undenizen> @HolePunchLeaf i wouldn't say it's particularly strong horror. a good GAME, but...
[5:20:02] <%kingmemelord97> the spicy room
[5:20:17] <%cooldude69xx> @HolePunchLeaf Resident Evil turned into an action series because of how nice the shotguns and friends were
[5:20:38] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[5:20:50] <%SirGO0SE> he just wants to be left alone
[5:20:57] <puse9> it's fine
[5:21:05] <%HolePunchLeaf> shotguns are powerful in the moment but require them to get close and risk unnecessary damage. and ammo is fleeting. Yeah you're strong now, but how long can you keep that up?
[5:21:14] <teefpal> Damn I was doing something else and missed the whole thing
[5:21:17] <%Dakuu75> good song
[5:21:23] <+FattimusSlime> @patstaresat He was just hurrying to pick his daughter up from school!

[5:21:38] <teefpal> Please tell me they aren't just the same enemies respawned
[5:21:42] <+GhostAnimals> I think the flaw here is that there's fuck tons of ammo everywhere. There's no real downside to using the shotgun
[5:21:43] <+CapnClassix> @PatStaresAt Just popped in. How you liking it so far
[5:21:45] <Srthunda> it seems that only rooms that were always safe are now populated
[5:21:46] <%Undenizen> @HolePunchLeaf well, thats a question of balance. mr. patrick here seems to be having no problem.
[5:21:46] <tanarath> I dunno, Regenerators & the Doll House section of 7 proved it could still be horrifying.
