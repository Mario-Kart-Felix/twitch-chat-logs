[0:05:36] <TrafficCohen> yes
[0:05:37] <Tisaric> True ending could be done in 8+ hours but fucking White Palace could take 2 of that alone if you're having trouble
[0:05:38] <Theoyveyman> ZOTE
[0:05:39] <ekkieekk> get the two endings before the godmaster endings
[0:05:41] <element_of_loyalty> :D I hear the voices
[0:05:41] <TheInkshow> Ah Zote
[0:05:41] <%Falilth> you're pretty low but audible
[0:05:43] <%Ayotocorp> >he thinks he's going to beat the game!
[0:05:44] <Theoyveyman> ALSO DO DLC
[0:05:46] <shotgang86> getting the void charm gets you a better ending
[0:05:47] <%commanderclaw> Godmaster added new endings tho
[0:05:47] <mercado94> More
[0:05:48] <element_of_loyalty> RIGHT EAR
[0:05:48] <+ruddyredbone> just from a ginger fuckboi
[0:05:51] <%skizzuto> yes godmaster did add more endings
[0:05:51] <KoyaMusa> Sure did
[0:05:51] <%AbnormalVoid> You have to beat every boss in the game in a row LUL
[0:05:53] <$shadow1man9> Yes

[0:06:00] <%Ayotocorp> You can ignore Godmaster for now
[0:06:00] <%skizzuto> you have to win boss rush
[0:06:01] <TrafficCohen> Gone
[0:06:02] <TheInkshow> This game is crazy
[0:06:04] <%LiquidBinge> Gone.
[0:06:04] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat So do standard endings with out dream nail, then do godmaster before void
[0:06:05] <FoulNightingale> Yeah, I hear talking now, too.
[0:06:06] <+shadowace2400> You mean besides the godmaster?
[0:06:07] <Tisaric> godmaster added a true true ending but it's actually insane to get
[0:06:09] <%Sirculbs> Do you think he can do godmaster?
[0:06:09] <+NWR_James> MOAR ENDINGS
[0:06:09] <$konekoryugamine> So, we have something on bugs. Where's Plague?
[0:06:09] <FoulNightingale> Sounds like Zote
[0:06:11] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Yes
[0:06:11] <Storm_Samurai> lol good idea pat
[0:06:13] <Rellim80> @AngriestPat Path of Pain! Path of Pain! Path of Pain!
[0:06:13] <%cervidaequus> @alcors_wisdom 2 min late, SHAMEFUL
[0:06:13] <Daniel_Is_I> Original shit first
[0:06:13] <dandyspider> white palace will end him for months
[0:06:14] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Thre are three endings - Dreamer, Dream Nail ending, and Gods
[0:06:15] <fillamar> Good idea
[0:06:15] <+NWR_James> COP OUT
[0:06:16] <custoadian> please do that first
[0:06:16] <TrafficCohen> No, DLC now
[0:06:17] <%LiquidBinge> Pat did you leave your porn audio on.
[0:06:19] <%DatLatinoGuy> 24 hour stream let's goooooooooooooooo!!! don't actually do that tho
[0:06:21] <ekkieekk> godmaster is fucking hard
[0:06:21] <Theoyveyman> The new ending is unlocked via absurd boss rush
[0:06:21] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Work on that other shit later
[0:06:23] <ValidVenasaur> big coward out
[0:06:24] <AncelDeLambert> Just take on the "bad" end for now
[0:06:24] <%mitchteck> Trial of the fool time dudes
[0:06:24] <AtlasMcCoy> Timestop of Timestop could take pat maybe 5+ hours
[0:06:24] <%BlainPLD> his face.... lol
[0:06:26] <+axellogic> Do you like Endings I got your endings, then you get an ending for your ending which gets you endings that unlock endings
[0:06:27] <london_flexing> COWARD
[0:06:27] <mercado94> normal ending first
[0:06:29] <shotgang86> yes please or you will be here for eternety
[0:06:31] <%TheImmortal70> @Abyssal_Jaguar There's another one with using standard nail with the dream nail requirements
[0:06:32] <element_of_loyalty> SKEMLO
[0:06:35] <Chaos80omega> @AngriestPat I can confirm, as I have been playing Godmaster. New endings, hardest crap in the game, makes Nightmare King Grimm a joke
[0:06:35] <Kghaleon> I don't think you should do the Godmaster DLC, at least go to the area and check it out.
[0:06:36] <strangelee> but do it
[0:06:36] <lilybergo> Go get the voidcharm, Pat, so easy :^)
[0:06:36] <AtlasMcCoy> ITS SO FUCKING ABSURD
[0:06:37] <SevenVileEyes> oh yeah it was zote talking
[0:06:38] <+NWR_James> BIG BACKDOWNS
[0:06:41] <TheInkshow> So u
[0:06:41] <%Minorou> yeah
[0:06:41] <Tisaric> Godmaster is the hardest shit in the game and there's already a bunch of insanely hard things in the game
[0:06:42] <shotgang86> godmaster is HARD
[0:06:43] <$konekoryugamine> How absurd?
[0:06:43] <C_S_N_G> That's why you need to do it
[0:06:44] <alcors_wisdom> ah come on mate i just finished putting out corn for the deer dont call me out on this
[0:06:45] <%skizzuto> yeah i haven't beaten godmaster yet, myself
[0:06:45] <%BlainPLD> "huh, well then"
[0:06:46] <%TheImmortal70> @AngriestPat They made changes to boss fights to add to difficulty, and OOOOH THEY FUCKED SOME OF THEM UP
[0:06:46] <KoyaMusa> but pat you're crazy
[0:06:47] <FoulNightingale> But pat, you are crazy people!
[0:06:47] <%cervidaequus> “we added 150% more game, enjoy!!”
[0:06:48] <+nigelmigel> Ignore the new ending its ridiculously hard to get
[0:06:52] <AncelDeLambert> ghost mage guy is AWFUL to fight
[0:06:52] <Daniel_Is_I> I haven't scratched Godmaster much but if you can beat Nightmare King Grimm I'm sure you can do Godmaster just fine.
[0:06:55] <IminyourBase> are you saying that a person who tucks themselves into bed like an envelope ISNT crazy?
[0:07:02] <ekkieekk> nightmare king is the end of grimm troupe

[0:10:33] <Arclight2879> LUL
[0:10:36] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat All you need to to do to get the first ending is just do that last dreamer and go to the black egg, you could do it pretty close
[0:10:45] <%umbypokochan> Woolie didn't even beat it yet technically
[0:10:46] <+Gorgen> Who's the angry dude?
[0:10:46] <+Taglog7> best twitch streamer? but he dont play da fortnite Kappa
[0:10:46] <Tisaric> I'm so glad Woolie constantly talked about it on the podcast
[0:10:47] <strangelee> Did Woolie actually beat Hollow Knight?
[0:10:53] <%TheImmortal70> He didn't
[0:10:53] <$Heelypeely> EYY BB
[0:10:55] <Tisaric> Woolie beat it but not the true ending
[0:10:56] <%TheImmortal70> He did the standard ending
[0:11:01] <alcors_wisdom> mr. shakedown
[0:11:02] <Storm_Samurai> Perhaps the Abyss in this game is actually the Woolie Hole
[0:11:02] <Donchalant402> he didnt get the true end yeah

[0:11:07] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 11m 9s.
[0:11:08] <Kghaleon> Woolie didn't beat Hollow knight
[0:11:14] <$konekoryugamine> @angriestpat Just god Dragons Dogma. Any advice fpr me?
[0:11:16] <%umbypokochan> can Woolie even do White Palace? i say no
[0:11:18] <+NWR_James> Amon is misery in 6
[0:11:31] <Tisaric> I doubt Woolie even knows about white palace
[0:11:32] <%HiroTSK5> 6 is the only game I've fought that guy in

[0:11:55] <felix_xb> does pat stream often think this is the first time I see him stream
[0:11:56] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Personally, I like the BIG FUCKIN' SWORD
[0:11:56] <Kghaleon> I doubt Pat can do Godmaster, but you guys should at least have him check the area out. It's cool.
[0:12:01] <gespenst_mr_ghost> :<
[0:12:02] <Sinister_Aglet> paige will go warrior

[0:12:31] <AncelDeLambert> Well, tell her she's wrong!
[0:12:38] <Theoyveyman> Considering how hard of a time Pat has when it comes to the most basic platforming challenge, the stream where he does the White Palace will take 13 hours AT LEAST

[0:20:23] <StingtheKing> There's a lot of beautiful detail in this game.
[0:20:37] <IHATREID> what does chat think of Doom 2016 i kinda wanna play it
[0:20:39] <FoulNightingale> Pat, you got me into Gungeon, got all 4 MC pasts beat, just need the robot and bullet!
[0:20:39] <Kghaleon> It's better than Symphonia IMO
[0:20:41] <Tisaric> that nail upgrade is actually insane
[0:20:42] <thinktank1> i know that itch
[0:20:45] <AtlasMcCoy> I get what you mean
[0:20:45] <element_of_loyalty> AGES? Pat you're only 23 years old.

[0:20:56] <AncelDeLambert> it's Castlevania
[0:20:57] <Virhauk> quenchylvania?
[0:21:00] <Storm_Samurai> It's the feeling you get unlocking a new zone and seeing it for the first time
[0:21:03] <%Dimfish> is zone themeing escalation
[0:21:05] <Jontman42> YEAH EXACTLY THAT! This game feels more like truly exploring a world than anything I've played in a loooong time
[0:21:10] <$googleygareth> Maybe it's the setting?
[0:21:11] <MZess> has Pat been to the White place yet?

[0:49:32] <%Dimfish> youre free to do whatever
[0:49:33] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @dekkitout More like bug artorias. Bug gwyn is super dead
[0:49:34] <Pairoschuz> there's technically no point in not getting the neutral ending now
[0:49:34] <AtlasMcCoy> If you do it you can see your completion %
[0:49:35] <%TheImmortal70> @AngriestPat You'd have to do god master, or the last bit of grimm troupe
[0:49:36] <@thenefftw> Then you might miss out on Ending 1
[0:49:38] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat Finish Fog Canyon first
[0:49:40] <$konekoryugamine> Listen to chat
[0:49:43] <hntronium> Blue Lake is fine
[0:49:43] <Tisaric> If you want ending A you need to do it before the next time stop
[0:49:47] <Donchalant402> you want to get all endings you may as well get it now so you dont bumblefuck your way into ending b
[0:49:47] <ekkieekk> if you progress too far in the story you lock yourself out of that ending but theres no achievement for doing it
[0:49:48] <flakari> You can complete it and just start immediately before the fight
[0:49:49] <fillamar> you will miss an ending permantly
[0:49:51] <$konekoryugamine> And these indigobloods
[0:49:51] <Kghaleon> You can miss out on one ending if you go too far and unlock Ending B.
[0:49:53] <Abyssal_Jaguar> THERE IS MORE ZONE
[0:49:53] <+Razputin217> ending A is missable
[0:49:55] <zargy> @AngriestPat go ahead and get ending 1 and then continue afterwards
[0:49:56] <AtlasMcCoy> GO LEFT
[0:49:57] <%galaxyswirl> youll miss ending A if you do, just fair warning
[0:49:59] <grimporio> @Pairoschuz what do you mean no point?
[0:49:59] <$magikestral> @angriestpat here's what i did: did everything but the third step to the final ending, did the final boss, then did the third step. Its real quick
[0:49:59] <Tisaric> THERE'S SO MUCH MORE ZONES
[0:50:00] <AtlasMcCoy> BIG LEFT
[0:50:00] <%TheImmortal70> DON"T GO LEFT
[0:50:01] <$nademonkey1100> did he do the flower quest?
[0:50:01] <qdawg2000> ENDING A FIRST MAN
[0:50:02] <CptBritches> It's not the true ending, but you could do it now and then do the true ending after
[0:50:02] <SatansDick1> ending 1 is missable
[0:50:03] <%Dimfish> you dont miss out on ending 1 till after you get super massive time stop
[0:50:04] <$Tredecian> neccasry for later endings
[0:50:04] <Ultimatefool> BIGGEST LEFT
[0:50:06] <AtlasMcCoy> FUCK
[0:50:07] <bleugh> ending A is almost the same as ending B
[0:50:08] <%TheImmortal70> @AngriestPat BIG TIME STOPS MAKE ENDING 1 BIG OWN
[0:50:09] <fillamar> ending first
[0:50:09] <ukokira> "Maybe beat it"
[0:50:09] <element_of_loyalty> LEFTIE
[0:50:11] <Heyestus> you missed a door below you too, there's a break in the downward shaft
[0:50:12] <%TheImmortal70> @AngriestPat DOWN
[0:50:13] <qdawg2000> THAT AREA IS NECESSARY FOR OHTER ENDINGS
[0:50:14] <%Dimfish> youre safe to go left
[0:50:15] <custoadian> he won't lock ending A for a while
[0:50:16] <ukokira> Yeah if you go for ending A I guess
[0:50:19] <+willowisper> there is a lot more to do, but if you do it now you'll get a missable ending
[0:50:24] <Donchalant402> ignore them
[0:50:25] <corepool> you need to go left first dog

[0:55:27] <qdawg2000> STOP MURDERING SOLAIR PAT
[0:55:27] <strangelee> Now do all the other inconsequential things
[0:55:28] <ekkieekk> the true ending is to sit with him and leave the game like that for a year
[0:55:30] <Tisaric> it's nothing but dreamnail would've been nice to see
[0:55:31] <%Dimfish> none of it matters
[0:55:32] <%korth367> it's fine man
[0:55:32] <$magikestral> easiest way to boss is down from dirtmouth, its like 2 seconds
[0:55:32] <$konekoryugamine> FALLEN SOLDIER I SALUTE YOU
[0:55:33] <+Corvax__> i dont see why some of chat is upset
[0:55:36] <%TheImmortal70> Alright, ending one time
[0:55:36] <%korth367> just keep going down
[0:55:37] <zal_silverfang> Pat's compassion only last for 3 seconds. "im sorry your kid is dead but I DONT CARE"
[0:55:38] <%ECRead> @AngriestPat did you set chat to Wumbo?
[0:55:39] <SatansDick1> time for ending 1
[0:55:40] <%AbnormalVoid> buptis
[0:55:41] <iwa5h4ck3d> You develop an S-link with him Kappa
[0:55:43] <%President_Miyazaki> Ignore chat except when you shouldn't ignore chat.
[0:55:44] <hntronium> Fuck off Zote
[0:55:46] <Saturdaythe14th> He just needs to remember to dreamnail npcs for dialogue
[0:55:47] <thisisacoolguy> Pat, check twitter when you get a chance
[0:55:48] <TakesGuts> chat is gay
[0:55:51] <$TenderBabyBacon> You do you pat
[0:55:51] <ShawnEXE> L O R E
[0:55:51] <AtlasMcCoy> Pat dont listen to chat, chat doesnt know anything. Just listen to chat instead, they know what's up.
[0:55:53] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> 'Muh lore'
[0:55:54] <+GrimSquirrel> its cool
[0:55:55] <qdawg2000> YOU NEED MAXED DREAM NIAL FOR TRUE END
[0:55:55] <+Fenlig> Use the dream nail on your mum!
[0:55:56] <+philosopher721> no u
[0:55:58] <hassanico> LOOOOORE
[0:55:58] <+ruddyredbone> yeah its pretty pointless
[0:55:59] <@StridentSong> There's a reason we call it the Lorenail
[0:55:59] <CptBritches> Pat, you could've invited him to join the channel as the 4th best friend. It's a very specific easter egg in the game designed for you
[0:56:00] <Saturdaythe14th> If you don't want extra dialogue then why are you even reading anything they say
[0:56:00] <+Ssaik> people loooove their flavour
[0:56:02] <qdawg2000> VOOOOOOOOOOOORE
[0:56:03] <$Tredecian> nail dialogue is all flavor
[0:56:03] <deviljhojho94> Chat is dumb
[0:56:03] <Saturdaythe14th> it takes like 1 second
[0:56:04] <Jontman42> It's just chat being obsessive
[0:56:07] <grimporio> "worth the hassle"
[0:56:07] <qdawg2000> VOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE
[0:56:08] <%TheImmortal70> You get lore
[0:56:09] <hntronium> People love lore
[0:56:09] <+Bt_Robot> GRUBMOS!
[0:56:10] <KoyaMusa> HOW IS IT A HASSLE ITS A BUTTON
[0:56:10] <Donchalant402> QUICK SLASH
[0:56:11] <FoulNightingale> What about the shopkeep?
[0:56:11] <+brave_sj> @AngriestPat You should be listening to chat, not listening to chat
[0:56:13] <element_of_loyalty> GREAT IMPRESSION
[0:56:13] <+TeethMuncher> People are flavor addicts
[0:56:14] <demonhunter790> Maybe you shouldnt do what chat says at random
[0:56:16] <%Minorou> Just imagine if you could dream nail everything in dark souls though.
[0:56:16] <Saturdaythe14th> "Why would I read more dialogue?"
[0:56:16] <deviljhojho94> VORE LORE
[0:56:16] <AtlasMcCoy> "The hasstle" Hold button for half a second
[0:56:17] <Abyssal_Jaguar> GO IN BRAH
[0:56:17] <%Dimfish> the chats just OCD
[0:56:18] <SatansDick1> it takes literally a button press pat
[0:56:20] <$magikestral> if you're there, its worth it, but if you leave don't bother
[0:56:20] <%skizzuto> it's just nice world/character building
[0:56:22] <Abyssal_Jaguar> 1v1 GOD
[0:56:22] <weizamaleza> people just want you to see all the easter eggs posible in the world, and most of is just....nothing
[0:56:22] <grimporio> @AngriestPat "worth the hassle"
[0:56:24] <definitelynotyakra> I feel like you could say the exact same thing about any game's optional lore
[0:56:24] <Kalavs> HERESY
[0:56:25] <qdawg2000> *SARCASM*
[0:56:25] <$konekoryugamine> Because imterest
[0:56:26] <gslayer14> what can we say we're whores for lores
[0:56:26] <Heyestus> No big bosses without dreamnailing tho.
[0:56:26] <Donchalant402> its time
[0:56:27] <energywarning> 3 3 2 3 no pat why
[0:56:28] <@StridentSong> The bug girl in the mines (before she becomes aggressive) is probably one more of the more interesting ones
[0:56:28] <strangelee> The Giant Worm thing near the Arena @AngriestPat ? That was a pretty good Dream Nail
[0:56:29] <iwa5h4ck3d> Whats the point of lore?
[0:56:30] <dandyspider> guy who told you it was rude to read his mind
[0:56:31] <Saturdaythe14th> it's not worth running back for but you can just do it in one second
[0:56:31] <+ruddyredbone> its like not reading descriptions
[0:56:31] <Zanicedg> Hassle of two seconds and one button press.
[0:56:32] <+philosopher721> SMITE THE HERETIC
[0:56:32] <bleugh> chat is stupid this is correct
[0:56:32] <ThetaFive> Dream Nail: *sigh*"bafanatta"
[0:56:34] <ukokira> Actually
[0:56:35] <+willowisper> you sometimes get interesting foreshadowing or character building
[0:56:36] <zal_silverfang> you are missing content. which doesnt help your OCD of collecting everything!!
[0:56:36] <%skizzuto> now it's FINAL BOSS TIME
[0:56:38] <alex_id> Yeah imagine if you had a dream nail in Dark Souls Pat.
[0:56:38] <$konekoryugamine> BECAUSE LORE
[0:56:40] <%TheImmortal70> Like he forgets those guys explode EVERY TIME
[0:56:41] <ukokira> What has Pat done in this stream
[0:56:42] <thisisacoolguy> Pat check twitter when you get a chance. It'll answer your questions on quirrel
[0:56:45] <Donchalant402> the "final" boss
[0:56:46] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Its not all that important, but its interesting
[0:56:52] <KayThree> Just go enjoy the boss!!
[0:56:52] <ekkieekk> i always run into the suiciders too
[0:56:53] <VanLynx> @angriestpat weren't you just talking up how cool it was that that one guy knew you were reading his mind?
[0:56:54] <@StridentSong> I WILL
[0:56:56] <deviljhojho94> OOOOoooooh

[0:59:43] <ancrest_tant> Is this Anor Londo
[0:59:44] <ukokira> The dlc's actually pretty useful since there's some special achievements for reaching % on certain conditions and most of them don't require 112% so the dlc helps makes things a lot easier
[0:59:44] <$konekoryugamine> HORNET?!

[1:00:36] <leole11> What did pat do before getting to hollow knight?
[1:00:37] <$konekoryugamine> HE RELATED TO HORNET?!
[1:00:38] <%kenpachi9211> apatDab DEATH COUNT 95 apatDab
[1:00:38] <Saturdaythe14th> DIED TO HOLLOW KNIGHT evoMindBlown
[1:00:40] <Rellim80> @AngriestPat 92% out of 112%. Not joking.
[1:00:40] <AtlasMcCoy> He's a way cooler bug knight than you'll EVER BE
[1:00:43] <+JFKRobot> Hey Pat, I'm thinking of getting a hitbox. Have you ever tried one? @AngriestPat
[1:00:43] <%ECRead> this man playin Street Fighter
[1:00:45] <CptBritches> Pat see the DMC V leaks?
[1:00:50] <element_of_loyalty> DRINK RED BULL
[1:00:50] <Kghaleon> No spoilers.
[1:00:52] <codussalpha> has he tried dream nailing the orange goo
[1:00:53] <+philosopher721> @AngriestPat Dream Nail him if you get the chance
[1:00:53] <Jontman42> Dreamnail up stupid
[1:00:56] <AncelDeLambert> I gave up on the actual final boss, I was so burnt out by then, I just watched the ending on Youtube, fuck it
[1:01:00] <Tisaric> There's lore for him we'll see later
[1:01:08] <+standproud591> @JFKRobot I love mine
[1:01:08] <@StridentSong> Keep the DMCV leaks out of chat, please
[1:01:09] <mayorrev> whiff

[1:01:12] <Jontman42> You missed tho
[1:01:13] <$konekoryugamine> Im just saying he fights and looks like Hornet!
[1:01:17] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> He doesn't have any , as far as I know
[1:01:19] <%Dimfish> ahahaha
[1:01:19] <Saturdaythe14th> trying to is worth it though
[1:01:20] <%TheImmortal70> If it hasn't been revealed in a interview don't say shit
[1:01:21] <captainthunderwolf> @JFKRobot That feels like an actual sick burn after seeing Pat get bodied by a tough boss. "A hitbox, you ever seen one?"
[1:01:24] <%TheImmortal70> Nobody wants that
[1:01:24] <AtlasMcCoy> There's a difference between a boss and a stationary NPC
[1:01:24] <Saturdaythe14th> to see what's happening
[1:01:25] <%Dimfish> he doesnt have one here
[1:01:26] <IHATREID> pats strategy of running and not just wacking his face off triggers me
[1:01:29] <+GuelermeDias> if you can get used to jumping with your thumb a hitbox is ok
[1:01:34] <ukokira> He had dream nail dialogue but it was cut
[1:01:37] <+Ssaik> :(
[1:01:38] <%TheImmortal70> God I LIKE that

[1:01:46] <Jontman42> There's the song
[1:01:46] <iwa5h4ck3d> comitting sodoku

[1:04:13] <ukokira> It ends in like 5 seconds badly since the seal's not actually there
[1:04:15] <grimporio> @AngriestPat maybe if you remembered game mechanics
[1:04:16] <Pairoschuz> No Pat go the other way, you're going the wrong way
[1:04:17] <hntronium> We can be worse if you want

[1:04:21] <%ECRead> shut up and show us your feet
[1:04:24] <Kghaleon> So the Hollow knight was supposed to keep the infestation sealed inside the egg, but it didn't help. The barriers just protected it from harm.

[1:04:32] <$konekoryugamine> THAT JUST CANNOT BE THE REAL ENDING! I CANNOT FUCKING BE THE TRUE ENDING!!
[1:04:33] <reonome> SHOW YOUR FEET

[1:05:18] <Pairoschuz> Every name in the credits that starts with N or B is actually Neil Breen
[1:05:19] <ukokira> If he does the final boss he's gonna get 100% at this point tbh
[1:05:20] <dartagnan4012> 112%
[1:05:21] <CptBritches> 112%
[1:05:21] <Tisaric> @AngriestPat so that 92% is just out of 112% total
[1:05:21] <+th3madness> do like woolie and pretend you beat the game
[1:05:22] <+TehBeerBaron> It's pretty easy

[1:05:23] <+Ssaik> Did we ever do Grimm?
[1:05:24] <+Rose_Inko> It's 112%
[1:05:26] <ukokira> Since he did most of Grimm

[1:09:51] <Zanicedg> Kings Station.
[1:09:53] <$OmegaWeltall> he's not wrong, and i like Shenmue
[1:09:54] <dukenux> It should be other way around
[1:09:54] <Jontman42> No but fuck Shenmue
[1:09:55] <+FoolsArcade> Yakuza is the real shenmu
[1:09:56] <$TheNeedlesD> @AngriestPat That's basically Castlevania started at SoTN
[1:09:56] <+velemi> WHO GIVES A SHENMUE
[1:09:56] <TakesGuts> hes right
[1:09:56] <CptBritches> Shenmue is what Yakuza has been striving to be for 15 years
[1:09:57] <$magikestral> shenmue was good for its time, not much at all like shenmue
[1:09:57] <DraxTD> @AngriestPat Pat is correct about Yakuza > than Shenmoo
[1:09:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> GET FUCKDD PAT
[1:09:58] <$wolfofsound> @AngriestPat Who hurt you with a dreamcast?

[1:10:01] <@SSaryn> Sure Shenmue, but I want Majima.
[1:10:02] <DevotedlyDragonesque> You do, apparently.
[1:10:02] <%TheImmortal70> @AngriestPat Shenmue didn't have the idol bullshit with a door you had to walk through though Kappa
[1:10:02] <dukenux> "Shenmue... YAKUZA THO"
[1:10:03] <$OmegaWeltall> Yakuza is just better
[1:10:03] <Prism_Wing> lmao same
[1:10:04] <hntronium> BUT SHENMU THO
[1:10:04] <mister_z_1994> Just go watch James Small's stream...oh wait LUL

[1:10:05] <Forester_Skippy> the yakoozies took shenmues fingers
[1:10:06] <mercado94> What did Shenmue do to you?
[1:10:07] <%Kirijuo> Shenmue does suck

[1:10:11] <kwangalang> I want more games like yakuza but in a completely different culture and continent, its impressive how much I am learing about japan
[1:10:13] <WeebFever> Shenmue has the same source popularity as Waluigi; Forced.

[1:10:17] <CptBritches> That's called suspense
[1:10:20] <JackMillerTime> damn i bought it because people compared it to yakuza
[1:10:20] <hassanico> @AngriestPat Pat don't you want to relive working a blue collar job forever?
[1:10:23] <+ruddyredbone> its yakuza without fight systems
[1:10:26] <PessimisticOptimism> He’s just butthurt
[1:10:27] <dandyspider> he still needs to meet the white lady
[1:10:27] <$magikestral> i doubt that

[1:10:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> YOU BULLSHITING
[1:10:43] <Theoyveyman> It's Yakuza but without gameplay
[1:10:44] <dukenux> maybe in 10 years well get HL3 announcment
[1:10:47] <Eresus> @kujofire990 he has not been in that area yet

[1:10:48] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Woolie, the trator lord
[1:10:53] <ukokira> Since he didn't get the thing that's 3 seconds after beating him
[1:10:56] <ekkieekk> lure big boi inbto swinging, dash through him and hit his back

[1:19:53] <Abyssal_Jaguar> SECRET STATION FIRST
[1:19:56] <+twohitgood> has pat fought the collector yet?
[1:19:56] <thisisacoolguy> HIdden Station for another protected mind
[1:19:59] <Abyssal_Jaguar> IT'S GONNA TAKE 4 YEARS
[1:20:00] <wunderkonig> the salt generated from pat doing the path of pain may kill the stream.
[1:20:02] <gespenst_mr_ghost> You still can't Dream Nail the Hollow Knight
[1:20:06] <element_of_loyalty> ???
[1:20:07] <qdawg2000> C-R-A-Z-Y T-A-L-K
[1:20:07] <+TeethMuncher> He has to find white palace first LUL
[1:20:08] <SatansDick1> whT
[1:20:09] <%Dimfish> yeah fog canyons a good place to go now
[1:20:11] <%Sirculbs> @twohitgood nope. I think he should
[1:20:22] <+twohitgood> it'd be an easy one for him at this point.
[1:20:22] <Majiinbooh> white palace white palace white palace
[1:20:24] <%TheImmortal70> He can do this in any order, we'll get to fuck palace eventually
[1:20:31] <Jontman42> This is a good place to go to as well
[1:20:32] <strangelee> Chat, let him figure it out himself
[1:20:32] <ShawnEXE> good call
[1:20:33] <%TheImmortal70> And then we can trick him to go and do path of pain
[1:20:33] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> The hollow knight can't be dream nailed, but he has cut dialogue for doing so. I don't know if it'd be a spoiler to post it, so I'm gonna hold off for now unless someone else says it's fine
[1:20:35] <$magikestral> fog canyon first y'all
[1:20:35] <%Dimfish> guys let him finish fog canyon jeeze
[1:20:38] <Hydrapissed> !uptime
[1:20:38] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 20m 40s.
[1:20:42] <CptBritches> Pat is going to try the Path of Pain once and then immediately nope and leave
[1:20:44] <element_of_loyalty> MY TALLEST
[1:20:44] <qdawg2000> LET PAT PLAY THE FUCKING GAME
[1:20:47] <Tisaric> He's basically opened up the rest of the game at this point
[1:20:49] <Theoyveyman> @AngriestPat The weird tree lady that gave you the ability to swim in acid was also a knight
[1:20:50] <qdawg2000> JEASUS
[1:20:51] <%Sirculbs> @angriestpat You like elmo grubs? Should find the Collector then.
[1:20:54] <Tisaric> so whatever he does is fine
[1:20:54] <%TheImmortal70> @cptbritches Not if we tell him it's required
[1:20:54] <%Agami23> just a reminder for people. its SUBtember, so gifted subs renue for a dollar next month.
[1:20:56] <+LtShuckle> pat do map now
[1:20:56] <thisisacoolguy> sharp shadow fucks you over in the area anyway
[1:20:59] <Bailey__gaming> Hi @angriestpat I got dead cells the other day any tips?
[1:21:01] <ekkieekk> no playing the game allowed
[1:21:03] <CptBritches> Pat shouldn't be allowed to play his game or have fun
[1:21:03] <ekkieekk> play it right
[1:21:05] <Undefinedsnail> only missing 3 charms
[1:21:07] <SatansDick1> map
[1:21:08] <FoulNightingale> What does sharp shadow do, anyway?
[1:21:10] <SolSwagGuy56> WutFace DEFENSE
[1:21:10] <Hydrapissed> so wheres he at right now¿
[1:21:12] <Jontman42> THE GAME IS ABOUT EXPLORATION, HE SHALL EXPLORE WHAT HE WANTS TO
[1:21:14] <Eresus> let pat play the game who he wants
[1:21:14] <%Dimfish> sharp shadow will fuck you down the line in a bit during a future area
[1:21:16] <AtlasMcCoy> Sharp shadow makes your shadow sharp
[1:21:18] <Hydrapissed> @FoulNightingale makes dodges hurt people
[1:21:18] <ukokira> @hunk_of_dunk It'll stop being a spoiler after white palace
[1:21:19] <%TheImmortal70> It makes your invulnerable dashes longer and makes them hurt
[1:21:20] <thisisacoolguy> It lets your dash damage people and extends the range of the dash
[1:21:21] <Kghaleon> He can't do Collector until after Queen's gardens
[1:21:21] <edward11231> Chat will you egg pat to do Path of Pain?
[1:21:23] <+SirSamVimes> @FoulNightingale extends dash range slighlty, causes dash to deal damage when you dash through people
[1:21:24] <FoulNightingale> Neat!
[1:21:25] <deviljhojho94> just do whatever we're gonna watch anyway
[1:21:27] <ekkieekk> secret in the big bug room at the station
[1:21:29] <%skizzuto> makes the dash hurt enemies
[1:21:29] <ShawnEXE> Sharp Shadow is great
[1:21:31] <%Beough> It's pats stream you came to watch him play...right
[1:21:34] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Hi Pat
[1:21:35] <CptBritches> We are just excited about White Palace
[1:21:35] <+SirSamVimes> @AngriestPat This game tends to attract a pretty backseaty crowd, it's super dumb
[1:21:36] <Tisaric> We're at the BIG BIG MOMENTS
[1:21:37] <+GuelermeDias> YES
[1:21:37] <@SSaryn> Seriously, if he did wanna do the full percentage, he will, chill your assholes
[1:21:38] <fillamar> Cause we are close
[1:21:39] <+CammyEXE> pat i love u
[1:21:39] <$nademonkey1100> im just here to enjoy watching the strim
[1:21:40] <+TeethMuncher> Pretty much
[1:21:40] <custoadian> just ignore chat, imo
[1:21:42] <DivineDragoonKain> PAth of Pain is optional
[1:21:43] <BakerBrute> Its cuz i haven't been telling them to shut up for a while
[1:21:43] <%Minorou> WE INSIST THAT YOU ENJOY THIS GAME
[1:21:44] <element_of_loyalty> PLACE
[1:21:44] <%AbnormalVoid> DO IT THO
[1:21:45] <strangelee> This feels very much like the attitude from the Dark Souls LP, just let him play the game
[1:21:45] <mayorrev> they're telling you how to play the video game
[1:21:46] <leole11> something like that
[1:21:47] <+velemi> Well YEAH
[1:21:49] <%Dimfish> longer dash fucks you up on future platforming bullfuckery
[1:21:49] <ukokira> I wouldn't say it was lately tbh
[1:21:50] <+TypicalAnomaly> There is no 'right'. Just playing.
[1:21:51] <%skizzuto> tbh path of pain isn't worth it
[1:21:51] <SatansDick1> we want your pain
[1:21:54] <+GuelermeDias> @AngriestPat we're all here to see you fail, but in a good way
[1:21:54] <corepool> yeah but do what u want
[1:21:54] <Jontman42> "But I want you to see this cool thing RIGHT FUCKING NOW"
[1:21:56] <qdawg2000> FUCK THE PATH OF PAIN I JUST WANT TO SEE PAT SEE THE TRUE END
[1:21:57] <%Beough> Like he's playing it the way he wants, cause its his stream
[1:21:58] <Pairoschuz> Chat needs its salt, we'll do anything for it
[1:22:00] <thisisacoolguy> No one expects you to do the path of pain, just wanna see you looka t it and laugh
[1:22:00] <leole11> YOU SHOULD PLAY THE VIDEOGAME THE WAY I PLAY IT OR ELSE!!
[1:22:00] <Abyssal_Jaguar> You right, Excited to se best girl again
[1:22:01] <demonhunter790> Pat of Pain
[1:22:01] <ukokira> This chat's been pushy as fuck since the start
[1:22:04] <cjsugar> it feels kind of like how ppl are with Undertale.
[1:22:08] <%HiroTSK5> So it is just like if you were streaming a souls game
[1:22:12] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat path of pain is an optional part of the white palace and you get nothing from doing it other then lore
[1:22:14] <BakerBrute> Everyone in chat has a duty to tell eachother to shut the fuck up
[1:22:15] <DivineDragoonKain> Let him explore to his heart's content
[1:22:15] <leole11> you should finish
[1:22:16] <Donchalant402> not worth it
[1:22:20] <DevotedlyDragonesque> Everyone just chill out and watch the video game.
[1:22:21] <+SirSamVimes> @cjsugar yeah HK's crowd isn't as backseaty as Undertale's, but it's still p. bad in that regard
[1:22:22] <CptBritches> He swim
[1:22:25] <SatansDick1> queens garden has a boss fight thats super worth it
[1:22:30] <scrumdrew> Path of pain is super not worth your time unless your super devoted to the lore @AngriestPat
[1:22:31] <hntronium> If we wanted pain, we'd be pushing for finishing Grimm. But we're not total shits.
[1:22:36] <+Fenlig> "Real Acid?!?"
[1:22:36] <Tisaric> MORE ZONES BITCH
[1:22:37] <element_of_loyalty> Green Greens
[1:22:39] <edward11231> Best looking area in the game
[1:22:39] <Undefinedsnail> this is greenpath 2.0
[1:22:40] <Jontman42> It's Greenpath, but better
[1:22:41] <SatansDick1> yeyey

[1:23:01] <Zanicedg> Up.
[1:23:02] <ukokira> And only like 4 things could possibly be easily missed
[1:23:03] <+brave_sj> @AngriestPat People are worried you'll miss cool things before you finish streaming the game. Just don't worry about it and play until you get 112% to be safe Kappa
[1:23:04] <FoulNightingale> I am amazed at this game, just the fact that you can get an ending without getting through certain areas. There's so much to do!
[1:23:05] <SatansDick1> go up
[1:23:08] <ThetaFive> This reminds me I really need to put the OSTs for this on my phone, I basically bought the game for them
[1:23:11] <CptBritches> Stinky

[1:23:32] <@StridentSong> So fair warning, we're gonna be timing out any spoilers about the pre-void heart charm, the void heart, or things leading up to the final two endings. We get you want Pat to see them, but he'll get to them at his own pace.

[1:24:03] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat There's a time stop back and up.
[1:24:03] <ShawnEXE> ORANGE GOO MANTIS
[1:24:07] <$magikestral> @angriestpat fun fact, there was a broken mantis chair in the mantis lords room
[1:24:09] <AtlasMcCoy> Welcome to pain
[1:24:10] <+LtShuckle> these mantises are infected
[1:24:10] <+SirSamVimes> @StridentSong purging spoilers is always the correct course of action imo
[1:24:11] <Coystick> Queen's Path is named after CLOTH!
[1:24:11] <CptBritches> Lying sneaky mantis traitors
[1:24:13] <+SirSamVimes> @magikestral dude shush
[1:24:13] <Tisaric> they detracted from the mantis tribe because they liked the infection
[1:24:16] <hassanico> And they're infected to boot!
[1:24:20] <ryu1299> it has more fun content than phantom pain too
[1:24:22] <wunderkonig> apparently being a traitor makes your hp go big up.
[1:24:23] <Daniel_Is_I> Yep these mantis gave in to the LIGHT
[1:24:28] <CptBritches> They are the traitors
[1:24:29] <demonhunter790> @qdawg2000 everything from the ocean is ancient evil
[1:24:30] <tremerss> the backgrounds are so nice here
[1:24:31] <%AbnormalVoid> they took it intentionally to be stronger
[1:24:31] <zal_silverfang> NOPE. they arent infected. they are just assholes
[1:24:33] <edward11231> @AngriestPat If you go back and visit the mantis lords you'll notice a crumbled seat next to them
[1:24:35] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Woolie boss fightt incoming
[1:24:36] <%Dimfish> big traitors
[1:24:37] <CptBritches> Nice
[1:24:37] <Coystick> Darkwraith Mantises
[1:24:38] <Tomschiii> its only 10 €
[1:24:40] <ThetaFive> There's gotta be perks for selling out your kin, like jetpacks
[1:24:41] <element_of_loyalty> DEATH COUNT
[1:24:41] <thisisacoolguy> SONIC BOOM
[1:24:44] <ukokira> They're totally somewhat infected
[1:24:46] <+willowisper> they purposely gave into the light for power I believe
[1:24:50] <Tisaric> This area is gorgeous
[1:24:53] <%TheImmortal70> The mantises say fuck your grid exploration
[1:24:55] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat In the Mantis Lord's boss room there's a broken 4th throne
[1:25:03] <@StridentSong> Lore things are fine, as long as they're post-wherever Pat currently is
[1:25:08] <Kghaleon> If you check the Mantis lord room, you'll notice a fourth "broken" throne in the background.
[1:25:10] <ukokira> There'd be no reason to abandon a tribe for sexy light drugs and then not take it
[1:25:11] <dartagnan4012> they too the resident evil monster deal
[1:25:12] <dandyspider> traitors accepted the infection for more power
[1:25:25] <$magikestral> and i think knowing that these are traitor mantises is post-knowing about the chair
[1:25:31] <CptBritches> That's a really nice little detail
[1:25:34] <AtlasMcCoy> I feel like pat would accept the infection for more power
[1:25:34] <Tisaric> exactly
[1:25:38] <Theoyveyman> THERE LIKE YOU
[1:25:38] <Mastigias> why
[1:25:39] <reiju_22> :/
[1:25:39] <AncelDeLambert> hence why hp go big up
[1:25:39] <Pairoschuz> Ayyyyyy
[1:25:40] <corepool> why
[1:25:40] <thisisacoolguy> Traitors are literally woolie
[1:25:40] <%Beough> God damn it
[1:25:41] <qdawg2000> no the infection DABS
[1:25:42] <element_of_loyalty> FAP
[1:25:42] <+sindrantz> stop it pat
[1:25:42] <%kujofire990> you know something that pat would do, get infected and stupid for more power

[1:25:54] <zal_silverfang> what is this new "slap" meme even
[1:25:55] <@StridentSong> @magikestral Yea, that's why we didn't time it out. It's post Mantis Lord lore

[1:26:10] <Psyramics> @HiroTSK5 Its the thing where he tries to ruin things for the youths
[1:26:10] <MarylandJutsu> USE INFECTION FOR MORE TIME ON THE CLOCK
[1:26:12] <weizamaleza> I gotta tell you, i didnt got any of this when i played this, i am too stupid or the lore is too cryptic?
[1:26:12] <AncelDeLambert> "Slavery, but" something
[1:26:13] <VanLynx> @angriestpat yes thank you for trying to ruin slap as well as dabbing you are doing great work
[1:26:15] <%TheImmortal70> Please stop praying for Pat, it only makes him stronger

[1:26:35] <CptBritches> Slap can never be ruined. Slap is pure
[1:26:35] <Tisaric> @weizamaleza lore is super cryptic and pat hasn't even seen most of it in the playthrough
[1:26:40] <KnivesEve> slap is a thing now?
[1:26:41] <@SSaryn> I'm here all week.
[1:26:41] <%HiroTSK5> @Psyramics Are slaps a thing the kids are doing?

[1:38:11] <custoadian> the last jump is a doozy
[1:38:12] <cintra212> The flower quest is for here.
[1:38:12] <wunderkonig> tip for flower quest. Most enemies don't respawn until you sit at a bench.
[1:38:12] <$nademonkey1100> i wached Nic from bitterbits do that it didnt look fun
[1:38:13] <codussalpha> THE PAAAAAAAIN
[1:38:13] <%netrac> Those spikes on the floor and ceeling are actually magnetized
[1:38:14] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Or dreamgate?
[1:38:14] <Pigbuster> It's not as bad as it looks as long as you go through the city and not the crossroads
[1:38:14] <iwa5h4ck3d> Just dont get hit 4Head
[1:38:15] <+ruddyredbone> yeah fuck team cherry a bit
[1:38:16] <%korth367> wasn't the stag near here?
[1:38:18] <ukokira> Honestly getting out of the grave is harder than getting to it
[1:38:19] <Jontman42> It's not so bad but you know you'll fucking fuck it up
[1:38:19] <qdawg2000> dont bother its not even worth it
[1:38:19] <%skizzuto> yeah i lost multiple attempts to the thorns in that room
[1:38:20] <mr_slaide> Big lost for small man.
[1:38:20] <Kghaleon> You don't need the heart
[1:38:22] <ekkieekk> you just have to kill all big enemies first then do the run without sitting down
[1:38:22] <TakesGuts> its not that bad really
[1:38:22] <+shadowace2400> teleportation is best
[1:38:23] <element_of_loyalty> Pats peach lost mode
[1:38:25] <hassanico> @AngriestPat If you kill the enemies without sitting at a bench, you can get here by taking a tram without much trouble and they won't respawn
[1:38:26] <ukokira> Like it's super easy to get to
[1:38:30] <CptBritches> Shortcut porn
[1:38:30] <Abyssal_Jaguar> GO BACK

[1:43:20] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat since you need to the shadow dash to even get to the room all his attacks are spaced perfectly so your shadow dash has a enough time to recharge

[1:58:23] <%Sackroad> Now he does.
[1:58:24] <@SSaryn> Destiny deserves more of your support than WoW.
[1:58:26] <Myribelle> they raised the price for you to list a single item on the AH now so people can't list pages and pages and pages of a single item rather than a stack
[1:58:27] <element_of_loyalty> smear

[1:58:42] <Virhauk> Pat of Pain
[1:58:44] <Perky_EDF> They tried to fix people tanking auction prices with single units of items by increasing the deposit for auctions.
[1:58:45] <%AbnormalVoid> It's super fun, you should do it apatDab
[1:58:48] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat hey pat, shit all over destiny 2 for being a bad game
[1:58:49] <@thenefftw> Because base Destiny 2 is not worth much on its own
[1:58:50] <bloodypurpledog> We need a gofundme to wipe a booger on Pats knob
[1:58:51] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat So blizzard made putting up stuff on the ah cost more because people where single stacking crafting items on the ah causing to many auction and the ah to be glitchy and slow because they haven't updated the ah servers in 15 years

[1:59:33] <Notsocleveruser> Why no more streams with Fuggs?
[1:59:40] <dandyspider> they give you the base for free then get you to spend more for the dlc and pass
[1:59:46] <AtlasMcCoy> Destiny is Warframe if it was worse and not free

[2:00:27] <%President_Miyazaki> Well the first Destiny was before Activision wasn't it?
[2:00:29] <Tearonex> Bungie really just fucked the fanbase over
[2:00:29] <LtThunderbolt> confirmed bad game :(
[2:00:29] <%skizzuto> Pat are you having a stroke? Do we need Paige to trick you into hitting your face again?
[2:00:30] <%unclekulikov> Bungie? More like Bungle
[2:00:32] <TheyCallMeVawn> Is Pat having a stroke
[2:00:35] <Zebylth> too much redbull

[2:00:37] <+thesw1tch> BUNGIE
[2:00:38] <kwangalang> No its because they know their players are stupid and will buy anything

[2:01:07] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Didn't most of the old Halo staff leave it a bit back?

[2:08:40] <%AbnormalVoid> apatDab Pat of Pain apatDab
[2:08:42] <cerberuscarmine> mwahahah
[2:08:43] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Pat of Pain!!
[2:08:50] <leole11> pat of pain is a great name
[2:08:50] <AtlasMcCoy> @MiraiUsagi Naw he backed down super hard at the final boss
[2:08:51] <+brave_sj> Down status: Backed
[2:08:52] <Arkrados> Thoughts on Blade Strangers?
[2:08:53] <%korth367> I'll give myself 100$ if you beat path of pain
[2:08:53] <@SSaryn> I'll throw in $50 for Path of Pain.
[2:08:55] <%Dimfish> big challenge
[2:08:55] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat I will literally give you 20$ if you actually go through with it
[2:08:56] <TheyCallMeVawn> Pat hasnt gotten to Bloody Palace yet? Kappa
[2:08:58] <%skizzuto> Path of Pain is super not worth the effort, even if people donate
[2:09:01] <%Sirculbs> Oh god.
[2:09:03] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> EASY $200 DOLLARS PAT
[2:09:04] <edward11231> Idk, I can it for 100
[2:09:05] <ukokira> It's still an easy $100
[2:09:09] <KoyaMusa> so many stag grunts
[2:09:11] <leole11> that is correct
[2:09:13] <$Mendin> Now are we talking Path of Pain -TONIGHT-, or just on stream ever?
[2:09:15] <%skizzuto> but I will enjoy every minute of your suffering if you do decide to do it
[2:09:17] <%Sirculbs> You're all tempting him
[2:09:20] <%TheImmortal70> So that's 270$ if everyone goes through with the payments
[2:09:21] <Kghaleon> Pretty sure he already marked it on his map?
[2:09:21] <Tisaric> It's fucking gorgeous
[2:09:22] <+TeethMuncher> Path of pain is worth to watch the suffering
[2:09:22] <%Jpdodds> use it waframes
[2:09:22] <Dunric_Mordamir> it's relaxing
[2:09:22] <weizamaleza> path of pain is a good meme and all, but it will not be worth it
[2:09:22] <FoulNightingale> It's pleasing
[2:09:23] <%Dimfish> thats good advice
[2:09:23] <Jontman42> It's a really good green
[2:09:23] <element_of_loyalty> IRELAND GREEN

[2:09:26] <%ArcanumMBD> Pat is sexually attracted to that green?
[2:09:27] <+velemi> It's very nice
[2:09:28] <SatansDick1> i love the aesthetics
[2:09:30] <%TheImmortal70> The guy, the modes for 150, and me for 20
[2:09:30] <@StridentSong> @AngriestPat There's now $250 on the line to beat the Path of Pain
[2:09:31] <aeonicvector> Real talk, hollowknights green areas are the BEST
[2:09:31] <ukokira> They actually give more than one way to tackle the harder things in it
[2:09:32] <%riantDeliration> Path of Pain is way overblown but its fun
[2:09:33] <jalordahedorah> buckingham green...
[2:09:35] <KoyaMusa> yeah not some shitlocks green
[2:09:35] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> ...Palace!
[2:09:35] <+TehBeerBaron> Turquoise
[2:09:40] <Eresus> Pat, if you value your sanity, you will not do path of pain
[2:09:46] <dandyspider> what happens when he gets an actaul time stop power
[2:09:47] <+Gorgen> woolie hole green
[2:09:47] <grayjammer> Path of pain'll be the most absolute tedious watch. just post proof of your victory on twitter n your free time
[2:09:48] <%TheImmortal70> @stridentsong I'm throwing 20 in there as well if he does it

[2:10:29] <%Dimfish> you can literally beat this boss standing still
[2:10:29] <AtlasMcCoy> Pat's ultimate weakness, being able to touch an enemy
[2:10:30] <@StridentSong> @AngriestPat Now $270 to beat the Path of Pain

[2:23:04] <AtlasMcCoy> Straight up might be like, greenpath
[2:23:07] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat So her deal was that she had someone important to her waiting in the bug afterlife, but she needed to die a warriors death before she could face Nola. In the battle, she claims that death.
[2:23:10] <Kghaleon> no point
[2:23:11] <%ArcanumMBD> @Mendin the black egg? no
[2:23:12] <ukokira> She passes on anyway so dream nailing her does nothing
[2:23:23] <ukokira> Aside from 1 essencep
[2:23:28] <$magikestral> @mendin he beat the hollow knight within the first hour
[2:23:30] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Pat’s being punished for doing the right thing.

[2:30:24] <dandyspider> you get the other half frim beating ehite palace
[2:30:27] <ukokira> Stage 3's no longer required
[2:30:27] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Oh fuck I don't know if I saw that big bug in the background of that bench before
[2:30:34] <ukokira> He's playing the pc version
[2:30:39] <%TheImmortal70> Pat has 5 hours of coliseum left to do
[2:30:43] <mothdude> Has he tried going into godmaster area?
[2:30:45] <Theoyveyman> There's still so many bosses for Pat to kill
[2:30:54] <ukokira> Which just got a patch letting u do the godsmaster without stage 3 trial
[2:31:01] <IHATREID> coliseum is mad ez tho
[2:31:04] <%TheImmortal70> God I hate the devs over this LUL
[2:31:09] <epylepticpanda> It took me 2 days to finish White Palace. I can't wait to see Pat lose his mind.
[2:31:12] <$Mendin> Yes but not doing the stage 3 trial is for COWARDS
[2:31:23] <ukokira> Trial Of Fools was overhyped tbh
[2:31:35] <ukokira> Dashing nail art and up b trivializes it
[2:31:38] <element_of_loyalty> <3
[2:31:41] <+brave_sj> <3

[2:32:40] <KingGalam> Is Pat as powerful as they say?
[2:32:45] <DivineDragoonKain> Moss not moth
[2:32:49] <ukokira> Mothman crashes stream
[2:32:50] <grayjammer> They weren't moths, they were Moss
[2:32:56] <%Squiddlybits> Those things deflating is hilariously cute
[2:32:56] <+TeethMuncher> @KingGalam what's your benchmark?
[2:32:57] <damienlunas> @AngriestPat btw one of the two charms you're missing is some seriously unintuitive bullshit to find.
[2:32:59] <VanLynx> but did it get exactly what it NEEDED?
[2:32:59] <ukokira> But yeah they weren't Months
[2:33:00] <strangelee> Were those Moths? O thought they were Moss monsters
[2:33:01] <ukokira> Moths
[2:33:02] <+BurncoatRapscallion> I heard a certain Mister

[2:33:25] <+TehBeerBaron> 15 blue hearts
[2:33:27] <%skizzuto> it's the blue heart door

[2:33:32] <%Dimfish> go back and left down there for fun guy
[2:33:34] <grayjammer> yeah i had to look up the 15 Blue Heart one
[2:33:34] <+HighjusticeGrimStoner> 15 blue hearts is really easy though
[2:33:34] <Donchalant402> no
[2:33:35] <mothdude> 15 blue hearts is in abyss, right?
[2:33:35] <+TehBeerBaron> yes
[2:33:35] <%TheImmortal70> @like_5000_people He has all the stuff
[2:33:36] <hassanico> That should be easy then

[2:33:38] <Heroes_of_Vale> no
[2:33:38] <AtlasMcCoy> No

[2:33:58] <AncelDeLambert> No, it's only in terms of blue health
[2:33:58] <ukokira> Just stack blue lifeblood charms
[2:34:01] <+BurncoatRapscallion> It's just a good upgrade but really unnecessary for the end game
[2:34:06] <ukokira> And then don't get hit
[2:34:07] <%Ayotocorp> He hasn't read the mushroom tablet yet

[2:42:31] <%thunderborn32> REEEEE
[2:42:33] <%JJCheeker> There's so much stuff in this game it's ridiculous
[2:42:34] <AtlasMcCoy> I mean it kinda worked
[2:42:38] <+TeethMuncher> It worked out okay
[2:42:38] <Nazgul240> fast travel
[2:42:39] <ekkieekk> thats dark souls
[2:42:39] <ukokira> Mr Mushroom is honestly the worst lp bait
[2:42:39] <hassanico> Heh
[2:42:41] <+brave_sj> I like how this is the opposite of RE5, where there you have to destroy the black evil, here you have to absorb the black good
[2:42:41] <mothdude> ""worked""
[2:42:44] <ukokira> Like yeah cool lore
[2:42:44] <%Enderborn18> it kinda was
[2:42:45] <Daniel_Is_I> Desperate times
[2:42:45] <%Trekalone> Isn't that the way with souls games?
[2:42:46] <%Dimfish> it kinda worked for a while
[2:42:49] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat It kinda is.
[2:42:50] <%ArcanumMBD> JUST SMOTHER THE LIGHT WITH BLACK EVIL. IT'S FINE
[2:42:50] <ukokira> But it's the worst to watxh
[2:42:50] <+HighjusticeGrimStoner> it really is honestly
[2:42:53] <Eresus> I mean... it worked... for a time
[2:42:54] <dandyspider> it was
[2:42:55] <strangelee> Hey man, there's no cost too high to prevent extinction
[2:43:00] <%TheImmortal70> They were dumb as hell
[2:43:01] <wunderkonig> hey if it looks stupid but it works.
[2:43:02] <+Roundelay11> They were beyond desperate
[2:43:02] <Donchalant402> just have a TON of kids, one of them will do the job right?
[2:43:04] <+HighjusticeGrimStoner> the abyss and the infection are both forces of nature
[2:43:08] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat It's the best we got, but we ain't fucking proud of that. rooKek
[2:43:10] <%TheImmortal70> Especially given the implications of WHAT the abyss is
[2:43:11] <Virhauk> it's more that it was high-risk high-reward
[2:43:13] <KoyaMusa> it was TOTALLY worth it
[2:43:15] <%AbnormalVoid> @AngriestPat they were fighting an omnipotent mind parasite
[2:43:15] <Daniel_Is_I> If they didn't misjudge the Hollow Knight it WOULD have worked
[2:43:20] <damienlunas> but pat as long as people keep linking the first flame everything will be fine
[2:43:21] <+TeethMuncher> @Donchalant402 aka the Jackson 5
[2:43:22] <%Dimfish> worse than extinction, deevolution
[2:43:23] <mothdude> Throw children at the problem until one of them lives.
[2:43:24] <+Walopoh> They clearly had no time to fully think it through
[2:43:26] <crimsonharvest> a real "up the downwell" vibe
[2:43:26] <$Mendin> How m uch Essence does pat have now?
[2:43:33] <ooblagis> The void honestly has had zero consequences up until this point in time
[2:43:35] <Tisaric> he's at like 2100
[2:43:36] <hntronium> Why not just teleport out?
[2:43:38] <+greenfall> you've gotten better at the platforming
[2:43:38] <%TheImmortal70> @Daniel_Is_I The thing is they didn't misjudge it, it literally gained personality. You do too, as implied by a certain thing.
[2:43:40] <barucasanova> like 2200
[2:43:40] <VanLynx> didn't wanna warp?
[2:43:40] <hntronium> Can't?
[2:43:48] <wunderkonig> better than Halo's solution.
[2:43:49] <$Mendin> So not the 2400 yet
[2:43:49] <Donchalant402> @TeethMuncher sbfpPatschwitz wew thats a spicy one
[2:43:51] <Dunric_Mordamir> Lore go up?
[2:43:56] <Dunric_Mordamir> no
[2:43:56] <BlitzChocula> if I don't have any friends on MHGU would I still be able to enjoy it?
[2:43:58] <%skizzuto> his warp is over by the traitor lord boss room anyway

[2:49:19] <%Sackroad> I once had a UTI that nearly killed me. The nurse at the ER thought I was septic.
[2:49:20] <%theblackgoddess> hes a dirty boy
[2:49:20] <%TheImmortal70> He's an old cat, and probably got some litter or some shit in there
[2:49:21] <$magikestral> weirdly the entrance to the tower is in kingdoms edge, this is the exit

[2:50:18] <+randis316> You wweee2 good thats the collectoe fight
[2:50:22] <AtlasMcCoy> My cat's gotten a couple UTIs before, it got pretty scary cause he would just go off by himself and it felt like he was just slowly dying over a couple days.

[2:55:45] <fillamar> Go back to the palace grounds
[2:55:49] <@StridentSong> Aww yuss
[2:55:49] <cerberuscarmine> OH BOI
[2:55:51] <Donchalant402> awww ye
[2:55:52] <DivineDragoonKain> Path of Pain took me like two hours
[2:55:52] <Kghaleon> Not worth it.
[2:55:53] <AtlasMcCoy> YE BOI
[2:55:53] <+shadowace2400> grubmos first
[2:55:55] <Bonobonobone> is Pat going 100%?
[2:55:56] <$Mendin> First he will have to -find- the Path of Pain Kappa
[2:55:56] <+th3madness> yeah
[2:55:56] <%Sirculbs> Big monies
[2:55:56] <+LtShuckle> FUCK THE PATH OF PAIN
[2:55:57] <CptBritches> Pat absolutely will not beat it
[2:55:57] <+Cervarian> I'd rather see him bash his head against the latest DLC fairLul
[2:55:58] <cerberuscarmine> super worth it
[2:56:03] <SkullKingKota> grubmos!!!!
[2:56:03] <hntronium> Yeyeye
[2:56:03] <+TeethMuncher> Pat needs a time limit though
[2:56:04] <Tisaric> I'll throw definitely throw in something for PoP if he does it
[2:56:04] <grayjammer> GRUB GANG GRUB GANG
[2:56:05] <Wurd> Path of pain NotLikeThis
[2:56:06] <+brave_sj> I'll dump every bit I have on me if you beat Path of Pain tonight
[2:56:06] <weizamaleza> the meme about path of pain is gonna be funny for 2 minutes and then is gonna be boring
[2:56:06] <LtThunderbolt> Would you prefer to live in the Dark Souls universe or Hollow Knights?
[2:56:06] <ekkieekk> finish white palace first before even attempting path of pain
[2:56:08] <blockedL> he wont do it this stream i bet
[2:56:09] <+th3madness> get those grubmos
[2:56:09] <CptBritches> Pat will try it 3 times then say fuck that
[2:56:16] <blockedL> i mean finish it
[2:56:17] <dekkitout> dammit!
[2:56:22] <strangelee> Honestly it feels like Strident just pays Pat in bets to be a mod
[2:56:22] <+HighjusticeGrimStoner> 100% isn't very hard
[2:56:22] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat There's a new path in Kingdom's Edge to the lower right you haven't mapped out
[2:56:31] <TheSinner42> Yeah I forgot about that one too
[2:56:32] <strangelee> I love it
[2:56:32] <+TehBeerBaron> I missed that one too
[2:56:37] <Kghaleon> Oh, you couldn't get it without dash
[2:56:38] <AtlasMcCoy> So fun fact, I only actually discovered The Hive because the grubmo map made me go in that direction.
[2:56:45] <+HighjusticeGrimStoner> fungal grubmo
[2:56:46] <DivineDragoonKain> fungal grubmo
[2:56:51] <Donchalant402> 4 total left
[2:56:54] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Oh right, that guy
[2:56:55] <%skizzuto> yeah everyone forgets that crossroad grubmo because you never really go through that way after you get the necessary upgrade
[2:56:56] <ThetaFive> That one in the center is super easy to miss since there's no reason to go back there after the very beginning
[2:56:56] <%TheImmortal70> No he totally got it
[2:56:57] <zal_silverfang> Fungal grub
[2:56:59] <$shadow1man9> South of the bench

[2:57:03] <FoulNightingale> rogjt
[2:57:06] <+shadowace2400> under the path to cast off shel
[2:57:07] <SatansDick1> right
[2:57:10] <@StridentSong> The bets let me launder the money easier
[2:57:11] <Kghaleon> I think there's a black gate

[2:58:46] <Tisaric> 3 MORE
[2:58:47] <%Remery_> When Paige and Pat get a second cat will it's name be Grubmo?
[2:58:48] <grayjammer> Chat. Do we REAAAAAALY wanna see Path of Pain. like, to experience that level of frustration for that long?
[2:58:49] <ShawnEXE> what is that track?
[2:58:53] <%TheImmortal70> @grayjammer Yes
[2:58:53] <$Mendin> YES
[2:58:56] <SkullKingKota> 3 grubmo
[2:58:59] <%TheImmortal70> 3 grubmo
[2:59:00] <element_of_loyalty> 11pm est
[2:59:01] <Nobrev> @grayjammer hell yeah we do
[2:59:02] <wunderkonig> I know it'll kill the stream so no
[2:59:04] <LodiFrostbeard> @shiplord299 never
[2:59:04] <+shadowace2400> after grubmo
[2:59:05] <mayorrev> has aanyone drawn elmo as grubmo
[2:59:05] <lord_campbell96> @angriestpat Would you guys ever consider a hollow knight lets play on the main channel with woolie or Matt playing since you'll know everything about and can guide them
[2:59:05] <IHATREID> absolutely yes
[2:59:06] <Tisaric> There's a reason it's called that
[2:59:09] <+universefish> path of pain is actual hell
[2:59:10] <Wurd> It'll be fun...........For us :)
[2:59:13] <AncelDeLambert> "you've got red on you"
[2:59:14] <+GuelermeDias> has pat embraced the pain?
[2:59:18] <leole11> path of pain is going to be really repetitive
[2:59:18] <mothdude> Path of Pain is redonkulous.
[2:59:19] <CptBritches> You will give up after 3 tries guaranteed
[2:59:19] <energywarning> i'd be more amused if you didn't just to piss off chat
[2:59:21] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Path of Pain is easier than Godmaster
[2:59:21] <+LtShuckle> Path of Pain should probably be the last thing
[2:59:21] <ekkieekk> i completed path of pain and im just gonna say you shouldnt do it @AngriestPat
[2:59:22] <hntronium> The Pat in Pain
[2:59:29] <+DakotaChip> @lord_campbell96 They've talked about it multiple times in the podcast.
[2:59:30] <dandyspider> can't wait to see his face at the grub quest ending
[2:59:30] <Tisaric> Path of the Pain is the most aptly named zone
[2:59:32] <element_of_loyalty> KILLED
[2:59:34] <lord_campbell96> oh
[2:59:35] <$magikestral> path of pain will probably be another stream, you should get done with the True Ending stuff first
[2:59:40] <Eresus> Hollow knight is LP poison
[2:59:40] <lord_campbell96> my bad lol
[2:59:41] <cerberuscarmine> DESTROYED IT
[2:59:42] <AtlasMcCoy> Dont worry pat, you'll be suffering plenty even without the path of pain
[2:59:42] <MiraiUsagi> i'm doing path of pain rigth now, killing myself and crying
[2:59:45] <+DakotaChip> Listen to the podcast. Reeee
[2:59:48] <OkamiDude15> pat will you be doing a kiwami 2 lp for the channel or naw?
[2:59:49] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:49] <%Kghaleon> They already did a video on ot
[2:59:51] <grayjammer> Diema... Wallabah...
[2:59:52] <+GuelermeDias> do a hollow knight lp on the channel but woolie is playing
[2:59:54] <hntronium> Five episodes of walking around
[2:59:55] <+GuelermeDias> Kappa
[2:59:56] <+Camail> at least you wont have to do path of pain 3 times because of a glitch
[2:59:56] <zal_silverfang> and yet you did a Second Gig for a David Cage game
[2:59:57] <+Walopoh> HYDRATE
[2:59:58] <+DrPoxx> If they released a boss rush mode would there be a LP of that?
[2:59:58] <element_of_loyalty> THANK YOU HYDRO BOT
[2:59:59] <Ryo_no_Kage> did you want to do the lp in the first place?
[2:59:59] <%theblackgoddess> true
[3:00:01] <strangelee> HEY
[3:00:01] <%TheImmortal70> 200 parts easy
[3:00:03] <cerberuscarmine> WATAAAAAA
[3:00:03] <+BurncoatRapscallion> THAT'S A GOOD BOT
[3:00:05] <shotgang86> can't argue with that
[3:00:08] <strangelee> Does Woolie Stream?
[3:00:08] <+shadowace2400> I guess you should drink water
[3:00:08] <CptBritches> Thanks, Hydration Bot
[3:00:12] <Xiangchang> Das a great Bot.
[3:00:12] <+DakotaChip> HAS HE BEEN DRINKING WATER?
[3:00:13] <+Schrodingers_Box> Gonna LP the Call of Cthulhu game when it comes out?
[3:00:15] <hntronium> What was the term? LP Poison?
[3:00:16] <%Dimfish> thats genuinely funny, but i understand why. a blind lp of 30 minute eps of hollow knight would be torture
[3:00:19] <+TransporterX7> Yeah the problem is Hollow Knight would be a 200 part LP
[3:00:26] <aeonicvector> I mea, for a STANDARD LP yeah, but as "lorethough" lp from a speedrunner would be alright
[3:00:30] <AtlasMcCoy> I honestly dont know pat
[3:00:33] <+shadowace2400> crazy talk?
[3:00:34] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat You gave up on him
[3:00:34] <wunderkonig> forgotten grubmo
[3:00:34] <thisisacoolguy> It would be 70 parts at most
[3:00:36] <%ArcanumMBD> BLIND AS PAIGE
[3:00:37] <ekkieekk> you probably forgot to come back
[3:00:38] <+GuelermeDias> I mean, what part would this be in 30min Pat episodes?
[3:00:38] <zal_silverfang> didnt have double jump
[3:00:39] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> You probably needed a movement ability to get him
[3:00:39] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat current max game completion is 112%, godmasters added 7%
[3:00:40] <Mythundare> read their grub minds
[3:00:40] <%TheImmortal70> Monster
[3:00:41] <$TheNeedlesD> Because you couldn't reach it the first time you saw it Pat
[3:00:43] <element_of_loyalty> ONE MO GRUBMO
[3:00:44] <%skizzuto> you didn't have dash when you last went through here
[3:00:44] <Scorchfield> you just haven't been back there in a while
[3:00:46] <+GuelermeDias> 40?
[3:00:47] <dandyspider> you're a void construct
[3:00:49] <hntronium> 2 more
[3:00:55] <ThetaFive> There' just not enough to talk about in an LP for this
[3:00:55] <AtlasMcCoy> You did SUPER good with grumbos
[3:01:00] <%Dimfish> hes read their minds before, they just say "HOME"
[3:01:01] <RyuuAoi> Pat is lying...
[3:01:01] <ekkieekk> these grubmos probably have abandonment issues
[3:01:02] <%Fenrirlives> what a shame, he was a good Grub!
[3:01:05] <fillamar> some
[3:01:05] <Theoyveyman> Forgotten Grubmo sounds like a souls boss
[3:01:06] <+shadowace2400> grubmos are good for pat
[3:01:14] <%TheTakkster> The beehive grubmo is fucked
[3:01:18] <RyuuAoi> Pat, do Dante's Inferno!
[3:01:18] <%Kghaleon> You would've found them eventually with the map
[3:01:19] <zal_silverfang> liar. pat hates us. only paige shows us love
[3:01:21] <Heroes_of_Vale> Wait, there's a wall THERE!!!
[3:01:22] <Fruitywhompus> grubmo !!!
[3:01:23] <AtlasMcCoy> Can you see how people found those super secret places now that you have the map?
[3:01:24] <+Camail> the archive grub was the one i had the hardest time with
[3:01:24] <+tigerfang86> more like Patmo
[3:01:24] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Imagine returning to DeepNest
[3:01:33] <wunderkonig> @angriestPat once you get all of them, and get time stop from the Father Grubmo, you're gonna want to bench then visit him again.
[3:01:36] <aeonicvector> Also FYI Joni-comb works if you like weird regenable blue health
[3:01:37] <damienlunas> Sharp Shadow is such a style over substance charm
[3:01:40] <strangelee> Sprint Master OP
[3:01:40] <+HypotheticalWalrus> I mean when you get down to it, this game is just a grubmo finder
[3:01:46] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat FYI the Messenger is a pretty Rad game and you should totally give it a spin on your own time!
[3:01:47] <damienlunas> literal edge lord charm
[3:01:48] <+DakotaChip> Grubmom
[3:01:51] <dekkitout> youre never truly done with deepnest, deepnest is done with you
[3:01:51] <Tisaric> yeah getting all the deepnest ones is really nice
[3:01:51] <+jezred14> w h i t e p a l a c e
[3:01:52] <pectusumbra> isn't this about the time for sprintmaster when you're cleaning up?
[3:01:54] <ThetaFive> Grub Simulator 2018
[3:01:57] <+MisterTylerrr> I would never finish this game cause the sound design makes me so relaxed, I wanna fall asleep rn
[3:02:03] <%Tredecian> @damienlunas its free damage tho
[3:02:03] <%TheImmortal70> @damienlunas You are so wrong. That thing is incredibly helpful supplemental damage. Especially with dashmaster, it is precious in godmaster
[3:02:05] <strangelee> GRIMMCHILD
[3:02:11] <cerberuscarmine> MAH BOI
[3:02:20] <%TheImmortal70> Grimm BOI
[3:02:26] <+antoniojlopezm> Dashmaster and Sprintmaster are so useful
[3:02:28] <Meta_Four> Can Pat get that last charm slot from the charm saleslady? Or did he already do that?
[3:02:30] <%TheImmortal70> Greenpath/fungal wastes
[3:02:30] <+JoeCritch> don't let this man distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.
[3:02:34] <Theoyveyman> T H E C H I L D . . .
[3:02:41] <aeonicvector> its about the same
[3:02:42] <element_of_loyalty> dumb
[3:02:43] <damienlunas> @TheImmortal70 I don't even want to think about godmaster meta
[3:02:50] <AtlasMcCoy> Btw pat, you can just press A on a charm again after equipping it to unequip it
[3:03:12] <cerberuscarmine> LOL
[3:03:13] <%TheImmortal70> Oh god I was dying at those edits
[3:03:18] <element_of_loyalty> MaxLOL
[3:03:19] <%TheImmortal70> "It's not Lupus"
[3:03:19] <cerberuscarmine> those fuckin horse pictures
[3:03:26] <filialpails> data's painting is making me dizzy...
[3:03:34] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Let me tell you about Homestuck
[3:03:35] <Fruitywhompus> everytime pat talks about hussie or homestuck i get heartburn
[3:03:41] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Andrew hussie is a fucking enigma of a human being
[3:03:41] <+Templar15> Hussie is a goddamn mystery of a person
[3:03:44] <Eresus> @damienlunas I never use hiveblood charm, but I completed pantheon 5 thanks to it.. so yeah...
[3:03:45] <%TheImmortal70> Is there any way to cure it? No.
[3:03:45] <zal_silverfang> god, homestuck.. so dated
[3:03:47] <$wolfofsound> @AngriestPat Every time you say grubmo it makes me think of gabbo from the simpsons
[3:03:59] <outis94> Happy anniversary worf is my favorite tng edit
[3:04:02] <%thunderborn32> wait does the acid keep the infection out?
[3:04:03] <%Agami23> hussie is so weird.
[3:04:08] <ooblagis> the horse poem almost make how terrible Homestuck is worth it
[3:04:11] <+velemi> I'm still not sure if Hussie's obsession with horses is ironic
[3:04:12] <edward11231> Homestuck is a relic we deserve
[3:04:13] <aeonicvector> @Templar15 No he's not, he shitposts and likes olivegarden breadsticks, just like everyone else
[3:04:15] <ooblagis> porn*
[3:04:18] <aeonicvector> just got famous for it
[3:04:20] <wunderkonig> probably not because the traitors have it
[3:04:23] <+TeethMuncher> Should I read homestuck? I feel like it's important to internet history at this point
[3:04:25] <DevotedlyDragonesque> Andrew Hussie is some sort of chaos spirit.
[3:04:26] <+Templar15> I guess
[3:04:27] <+Gorgen> What are the TNG edits?
[3:04:30] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Remember when dril got doxxed by homestucks and everyone ignored it like that scene in Spiderman 2
[3:04:32] <%Sackroad> Look at all this fucking Mountain Dew.
[3:04:33] <strangelee> Remember Pat, it's already everywhere
[3:04:43] <+Templar15> teethmuncher, go ahead and try
[3:04:43] <%Trekalone> This is part of my my working theory that all pieces of internet culture can be linked back to either Hussie or Niel Cicierega
[3:04:44] <element_of_loyalty> CHECK MAP
[3:04:46] <%JJCheeker> I love the music in this area so much
[3:04:50] <aeonicvector> @TeethMuncher maybe a bit, but ill tell you know, its ending isnt worth it, read til you hate it, and know the begining is slow
[3:04:52] <zal_silverfang> @TeethMuncher dude you are way too far behind and it is so... "dense" to get into. not worth it
[3:04:57] <aeonicvector> now*
[3:04:59] <ThetaFive> GRUBMOS EXPOSED LIVE ON STREAM
[3:04:59] <Tisaric> Man seeing how easy Pat is destroying everything with the third nail upgrade makes me glad I beat it without it
[3:04:59] <cerberuscarmine> LIVE ON AIR
[3:05:00] <xfiring> rockGrub
[3:05:06] <%JJCheeker> This whole soundtrack was so good
[3:05:08] <DevotedlyDragonesque> @TeethMuncher I think it's worth a read. Some people might disagree, though.
[3:05:11] <+brave_sj> Vee oh dee
[3:05:12] <aeonicvector> OST was great though
[3:05:12] <grayjammer> hey vod watchers!!!!! You stink!!!!!
[3:05:13] <%Tredecian> @TeethMuncher its really long not worth unless you like it
[3:05:14] <%mattmanj17> @AngriestPat you a BIG HUGE now
[3:05:18] <+akaAxi0m> Hi Pat. Watching the VOD atpRtsd
[3:05:19] <fillamar> Pat, if you read this, what is tired status?
[3:05:20] <+Cervarian> fairWave hello VOD viewers
[3:05:20] <Tisaric> OST is phenomonal
[3:05:20] <%ECRead> we appreciate VOD BOYS in this stream
[3:05:29] <zal_silverfang> @TeethMuncher and to be honest. it is rather trash
[3:05:29] <+Walopoh> When you were going through here was the last time I watched
[3:05:31] <+sogeki_dan> Enter new room. CHECK MAP, halfway in, CHECK MAP, Leaving area, CHECK MAP, in new area, CHECK MAP

[3:05:39] <OhioNitsud> it's that you're both
[3:05:40] <+velemi> @TeethMuncher Homestuck is one of those things that you'll either love or loathe
[3:05:43] <+shadowace2400> you will NEED to equip hiveblood for the palace of pain
[3:05:53] <element_of_loyalty> BENCH
[3:05:56] <alcors_wisdom> gotta stop drawing to check this out
[3:05:56] <OkamiDude15> woopsEZ hey vod boy check this out woopsGottem
[3:06:04] <thisisacoolguy> You don't need Hive Blood for pop lol
[3:06:06] <edward11231> @teethmuncher I read it for a class and got in to it fast, I binged it in a week which is not healthy. I’d read it if you are curious about its impact as I was
[3:06:10] <Tisaric> fungalmo
[3:06:12] <grayjammer> @velemi Why not both?
[3:06:13] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Fungo Grubmo
[3:06:15] <0rond> I did white palace without hiveblood
[3:06:15] <ShawnEXE> Deep focus and grub song guarantee that you should never die during the platforming
[3:06:18] <+TeethMuncher> Thanks guys, I'll attempt Homestuck, wish me luck
[3:06:20] <AtlasMcCoy> Yea I getchu pat. It's like, seeing the hard earned progress you've made after a long journey.
[3:06:21] <ThetaFive> The Furtive Grubmo
[3:06:21] <+HighjusticeGrimStoner> that grubmo has a fungal infection, save them
[3:06:22] <%kujofire990> Funko Grubmo?
[3:06:22] <+shadowace2400> if you want to make it through without dying
[3:06:23] <Huntercd> Has anyone seen Pat drink water on stream or just redbull?
[3:06:27] <%TheImmortal70> "We are exploring the unknown" LUL
[3:06:39] <Tampaoster> Just like wimin
[3:06:39] <WaffleLeech> It's the final grubmo!
[3:06:39] <element_of_loyalty> Matt
[3:06:40] <C_S_N_G> He has a redbull IV
[3:06:41] <%titans_ace_jerid> He also likes being shot.
[3:06:42] <%Trekalone> I think people overste how bad the ending of Homesuck is. Sure Act 5 is the best part, but people romanticize it too much and Act 6 looks worse as a result
[3:06:42] <element_of_loyalty> JEDUS

[3:07:17] <%Agami23> i did and it was awful due to internet issues
[3:07:17] <Sundz15> Pat’s finally lost his mind
[3:07:18] <agustorm123> Chat chat we are the chat
[3:07:19] <$OmegaWeltall> yea... FeelsBadMan
[3:07:19] <%Kghaleon> It was a shit show
[3:07:19] <Prism_Wing> It's challenging lol
[3:07:20] <zal_silverfang> ive talked in front of a crowd several times before soooo
[3:07:21] <SeventyForce> TUMBLING DOWN TUMBLING DOWN TUMBLING DOWN
[3:07:22] <+TehBeerBaron> Yup. It's fucking weird to just talk to yourself with nobody watching
[3:07:22] <%FoolsArcade> I have done twitch stream with both alone and with friends
[3:07:27] <@thenefftw> It's quite challenging
[3:07:29] <SatansDick1> youre supposed to refer to chat in 2nd person
[3:07:33] <%ECRead> i have only ever streamed with others because i am a coward
[3:07:36] <+Walopoh> I want her to return doing that
[3:07:37] <ThetaFive> I've done livestreams but never had enough audience >_>
[3:07:38] <Donchalant402> I think its fun
[3:07:40] <DevotedlyDragonesque> I haven't streamed and I never will, but I imagine that it feels super weird.
[3:07:41] <Tisaric> It's just fucking weird
[3:07:41] <+HighjusticeGrimStoner> I talk to myself all the time anyway so it was easy for me
[3:07:42] <%thunderborn32> had a memory because someone was talking about reading i once got in trouble in school for reading a book, YAY ALABAMA
[3:07:42] <element_of_loyalty> Talking to a camera?
[3:07:43] <%Tredecian> *hivemind
[3:07:47] <deviljhojho94> How dare you objectizise us
[3:07:50] <%Dimfish> ive hosted a fair number of lets call them less than legal live streams
[3:07:50] <Huntercd> So Pat is hydrated, that is good
[3:07:51] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> “Give me compliments. I said, ‘A-give me compliments.’”
[3:07:51] <grayjammer> A "Nebulous Us"
[3:07:54] <aeonicvector> ay shimwae
[3:07:55] <+TeethMuncher> I'm talking to you from the past
[3:07:56] <CptBritches> Yeah, but we are a textbox that slaps
[3:07:57] <zal_silverfang> it's trying to humanize the inhuman
[3:07:57] <+NWR_James> YOU'RE WEIRD
[3:07:57] <+GuelermeDias> WE AREN'T JUST LETTERS PAT WE ARE PEOPLE TOO
[3:07:57] <TheMilhouseExperience> Pat you're not going crazy, you're going sane in a crazy world.
[3:07:58] <energywarning> it's true. we're not real
[3:08:00] <thisisacoolguy> It's okay pat, we're not real. We're a program
[3:08:01] <dekkitout> communing with a hive-mind is always daunting
[3:08:03] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat talk to use like we are a single person in a room who's name you don't know. rooThink
[3:08:04] <%Spur3G> Pat you are completely right
[3:08:08] <agustorm123> We are people?
[3:08:08] <%Tredecian> or the geth
[3:08:08] <$magikestral> would you prefer if we all got on discord
[3:08:09] <blockedL> i can get that
[3:08:10] <ThetaFive> WE ARE THE CHAT
[3:08:10] <%skizzuto> yeah that's pretty much it
[3:08:10] <+TeethMuncher> The future is now!
[3:08:11] <%Squiddlybits> He's become self aware. End the simulation.
[3:08:13] <deviljhojho94> tfw not real FeelsGoodMan
[3:08:14] <SeventyForce> How can you be sure that something's real now days
[3:08:14] <ekkieekk> having to repeat what were saying every time you respond to us must be weird
[3:08:15] <DuskPixie> ASSIMILATE

[3:08:23] <AtlasMcCoy> I imagine solo LPs are very similar no? Even weirder since there isnt actually a chat
[3:08:23] <wunderkonig> @angriestPat btw there's a weird talking mushroom that unlocks a hidden ending. you need the shroom charm to talk to it. He appears after defeating the dreamers so he should be around somewhere. But it's entirely optional.

[3:12:33] <pectusumbra> yeah, it's gross but fine everyone. Old one will die and they will pop out like cuddly chestbursters
[3:12:34] <thisisacoolguy> It's just the next stage for the grubmo's to evolve. It's fine. Everything is fine
[3:12:35] <Dunric_Mordamir> RIP Grubmos

[3:12:44] <+Corvax__> they probably use him like a big cocoon
[3:12:45] <strangelee> If my understanding is correct, they will metamorphisize inside of the father to become something new
[3:12:45] <+jezred14> WHITE PALACE TIME
[3:12:47] <Nobrev> @AngriestPat they eat him from the inside out when they mature. hes sacrificing himself

[3:12:56] <Eresus> WHITE PALACE
[3:12:56] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat there aren't really any battles on the white palace so you'd benefit from a different charm loadout, also since its counts as a dream you can use fragile heart
[3:12:58] <johnny2by4x6> PALACE OF PAIN
[3:12:59] <deviljhojho94> They are going to become gruberflies probably
[3:13:00] <deviljhojho94> its ok

[3:13:06] <$magikestral> charm lady probably won't give the blessing until later, sadly
[3:13:07] <lilybergo> PogChamp WHITE
[3:13:07] <Tisaric> ???

[3:13:23] <fireking900> Would Pat Vore Elmo so he could be big and strong?
[3:13:29] <agustorm123> Did he fight night king Grimm?
[3:13:29] <+TransporterX7> Also someone remind Pat about the Blue life combo with that thing
[3:13:31] <+shadowace2400> probably
[3:13:31] <deviljhojho94> Pat would do it
[3:13:32] <DivineDragoonKain> you don't have all of the charms yet
[3:13:34] <+JustToWatch> @AngriestPat need to go to white palace to complete charm to get blessing
[3:13:35] <hntronium> @AngriestPat You might be able to buy the thing from the charm lady?
[3:13:40] <damienlunas> I don't think Salubra gives you anything until you get the other half of the white charm?
[3:13:41] <dekkitout> if anything, elmo would vore pat
[3:13:41] <%Kghaleon> What's next, white palace?
[3:13:43] <+Camail> thats kind of a lie

[3:13:49] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Would you eat Elmo and let him feed on your insides so he could evolve?
[3:13:49] <%Agami23> grubsong+deep focus
[3:13:49] <%Kghaleon> Not really true
[3:13:50] <Zanicedg> Hive blood.
[3:13:51] <%Enderborn18> mark of pride
[3:13:51] <Scorchfield> yep, take hiveblood
[3:13:51] <Sedrelic> hive ..do hive
[3:13:51] <FoulNightingale> HIvebloo
[3:13:52] <Borealum_EX> prepare for pain

[3:13:55] <%AbnormalVoid> Big Health Restoration Charms
[3:13:57] <AtlasMcCoy> Hive blood, heal up
[3:13:57] <reiju_22> hive
[3:13:58] <+Camail> also for fucks sake chat let him fucking find out
[3:13:58] <%Piemen99> Did Pat find out any lore or cool shit in the past few hours
[3:13:58] <CptBritches> Hiveblood
[3:13:59] <dalishprince> paige was vored once, thats why shes big and strong
[3:14:00] <hntronium> Hiveblood
[3:14:02] <cintra212> Yoou need the other half to get Salubras blessing
[3:14:04] <wunderkonig> ....you'll want some combat charms for pain.
[3:14:06] <aeonicvector> hive+join works
[3:14:06] <wunderkonig> not many, but some.
[3:14:08] <DivineDragoonKain> There is absolutely like some combat
[3:14:10] <Donchalant402> fragile heart
[3:14:10] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Speed and dash master
[3:14:10] <+TeethMuncher> OVERCHARM
[3:14:11] <+HighjusticeGrimStoner> @AngriestPat I suggest grubsong + deep focus + grubberfly for infinite health
[3:14:14] <DivineDragoonKain> just once
[3:14:14] <%TheImmortal70> Fragile heart
[3:14:16] <%Tredecian> fragile health maybe?
[3:14:17] <+JustToWatch> @AngriestPat Mark of pride helps for bouncing puzzles
[3:14:18] <scrumdrew> there is fighting
[3:14:19] <aeonicvector> joni + hive works
[3:14:19] <ekkieekk> and a blue heart thing
[3:14:20] <leole11> there's like literally 2 dudes in total, who cares
[3:14:20] <Donchalant402> dream so it doesnt break
[3:14:22] <scrumdrew> very little
[3:14:22] <agustorm123> He gonna have a bad time
[3:14:23] <+antoniojlopezm> Dashmaster/Speedmaster never hurt either
[3:14:32] <Zanicedg> long nail]
[3:14:33] <Tisaric> there's a little bit of combat but it's not worth the charm slots
[3:14:35] <$magikestral> fragile heart won't break but i don't think its necessary
[3:14:37] <%TheImmortal70> You don't need deep focus and grub song with honey
[3:14:38] <Donchalant402> keep hiveblood
[3:14:42] <johnny2by4x6> You'll be fine
[3:14:43] <grayjammer> Joni+Hive isn't that good
[3:14:45] <BakerBrute> hiveblood is the most important one
[3:14:45] <Zanicedg> Hive blood is a must.
[3:14:48] <+velemi> Pat hiveblood is probably the most important
[3:14:50] <reiju_22> no hive :O
[3:14:50] <damienlunas> hiveblood is big
[3:14:50] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Speed and dash
[3:14:50] <WaffleLeech> If that's all the charms then he should go visit the charm lady
[3:14:51] <+shadowace2400> hiveblood
[3:14:51] <%Puppet88> hiveblood may be a must
[3:14:52] <AtlasMcCoy> Long nail?
[3:14:54] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat keep hive, ditch deep focus
[3:14:56] <+HighjusticeGrimStoner> hive isn't really a must, it's too slow
[3:14:56] <scrumdrew> long nail?
[3:14:57] <ekkieekk> blue hearts
[3:14:58] <agustorm123> Just do it like I did zero charms fucker
[3:15:00] <+TeethMuncher> YEYEY
[3:15:00] <Zanicedg> Long nail
[3:15:00] <0rond> HIVE BLOOD IS FOR COWARDS AND SCRUBS
[3:15:01] <+HighjusticeGrimStoner> wastes too much time
[3:15:03] <MrArkannoyed> don't bother with hiveblood
[3:15:05] <ShawnEXE> Hiveblood isn't really that good, it's slow as fuck, deepfocus and grub is better
[3:15:05] <+G_Thunders> Dash master helped for dashing down
[3:15:06] <%Kghaleon> It's really not that bad, I did it in one go.
[3:15:07] <wunderkonig> oh right, charm lady, he still needs to finish path of pain for that.
[3:15:08] <+Corvax__> you'll be fine with that setup
[3:15:11] <wunderkonig> not pain white palace
[3:15:12] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Hiveblood alone is enough to keep you alive, you just have to wait for it to regen every time you die
[3:15:12] <%ArcanumMBD> Words are hard
[3:15:15] <blockedL> yea
[3:15:16] <@StridentSong> Hiveblood/Quick Nail?Mark of Pride. hiveblood is 100% the most important one
[3:15:19] <ukokira> Please tel me he just got that grubb charm

[3:43:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> Das rite Pat
[3:43:16] <shotgang86> dont overthink this part
[3:43:20] <leole11> White Palace wasn't built like this to keep anyone out, it was build to test the vessels.
[3:43:20] <$Mendin> Do you hear bees? Because I think we found THE PAIN
[3:43:21] <DevotedlyDragonesque> @G_Thunders We're in a dreamworld, so it probably didn't actually look like this.
[3:43:22] <DXLelouch24> hey pat i finished tonighta banner saga
[3:43:25] <%thunderborn32> @SGrim true but he also got the gout so cholesterol is eventually a problem for him
[3:43:26] <+Ssaik> I remember spikey funland
[3:43:28] <+Caffieantedjedi> This area always makes me feel like I'm accidentally backtracking, even when I'm making progress.

[3:44:04] <+sindrantz> LUL
[3:44:04] <+Reaper102388> Oh no
[3:44:07] <BakerBrute> this party fucking sucks
[3:44:08] <$SGrim> @thunderborn32 a problem also mitigated by a proper balanced diet. Something Pat obviously struggles to maintain.
[3:44:10] <DXLelouch24> tryggi warned you about helmets
[3:44:13] <leole11> the bad part
[3:44:15] <%Enderborn18> i love this part
[3:44:16] <Theoyveyman> does it feel good?
[3:44:19] <%thunderborn32> that being said its ALOT easier to critique someones habits then it is to actually be healthy
[3:44:20] <BakerBrute> these next two parts fucking suck
[3:44:21] <Abyssal_Jaguar> NO
[3:44:22] <%Kghaleon> There's a secret shortcut near the top of this area, it's pretty important

[3:44:28] <SatansDick1> idk
[3:44:29] <Zanicedg> No.
[3:44:29] <+Bouerd> BRUTE SKILL
[3:44:29] <WaffleLeech> No but that was slick

[3:44:38] <johnny2by4x6> IT just works
[3:44:38] <leole11> there's a much easier way honestly
[3:44:39] <element_of_loyalty> CHEATS
[3:44:39] <$Mendin> In the White Palace, whichever way works is the Right and Correct Way

[3:58:03] <+BurncoatRapscallion> You did White Palace in a bullshit way and it was pretty good
[3:58:03] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat It was excellent time, so Path of Pain should be a worthy challenge Kappa
[3:58:03] <hntronium> You did pretty well
[3:58:04] <custoadian> people tend to build up the white palace a lot, it seems like
[3:58:06] <Piejumper5814> YOU DID INCREDIBLE

[3:58:12] <fillamar> well...
[3:58:13] <Donchalant402> path of pain is the bullshit
[3:58:14] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Path of pain is that alot worse
[3:58:15] <ValidVenasaur> Doing it after getting hiveblood makes it ewasy
[3:58:15] <epylepticpanda> U EVEN SKIPPED AREAS
[3:58:15] <strangelee> it's not over man
[3:58:16] <fillamar> path of pain
[3:58:16] <ooblagis> You done good
[3:58:16] <shotgang86> better than me at least
[3:58:16] <scrumdrew> PoP is the one thats not great
[3:58:17] <%Enderborn18> the path of pain is the way worse
[3:58:17] <johnny2by4x6> That wasn't the path of Pain
[3:58:17] <dalmek> I mean you DID skip a bunch
[3:58:18] <IHATREID> you didnt even do path of pain dumbass
[3:58:18] <%thunderborn32> i think there's more white palace
[3:58:18] <grayjammer> Pretty good for your first try. PoP is absolutely doable for you
[3:58:18] <@StridentSong> The Path of Pain is a lot worse.
[3:58:18] <+Hotironclad> it's no celeste
[3:58:19] <mothdude> Quirrel...
[3:58:21] <+th3madness> white palace is meant to be doable
[3:58:22] <SwindlerOfProgress> The Path of Pain is MUCH worse.
[3:58:22] <$magikestral> path of pain is that "a lot worse"
[3:58:24] <coolguyvince> dont worry you didnt do the hard part yet
[3:58:24] <aeonicvector> TBF, we expected less of you given earlier platforming, but you pulled it together
[3:58:27] <edward11231> RIGHT?!!?!?

[3:58:46] <%NobleJedi> LUL
[3:58:46] <+Arsimckhoi> its almost like pat plays video games for a living
[3:58:47] <wunderkonig> the problem is most people don't remember the bullshit days of platforming that were the n64 and gameboy eras
[3:58:48] <+Fenlig> Doesnt help with Xcom
[3:58:48] <$wolfofsound> Nani the fuck?
[3:58:48] <ShawnEXE> They were hyping it up too much, it's like celeste levels of difficulties where A side are the normal and path of pain is like B side/C side

[4:04:05] <LodiFrostbeard> yeah, this is fucking insane
[4:04:06] <scrumdrew> unique thing about PoP all the soul statues are infinite
[4:04:06] <rhus> @VritraReiRei thought so, thanks :)
[4:04:07] <shotgang86> pat you kick from the saw and the dash and double jump
[4:04:11] <Daniel_Is_I> I think I cleared the White Palace faster than Pat and Path of Pain took me like 1.5-2 hours
[4:04:11] <%Tredecian> stature on the left
[4:04:12] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat Dash and then double jump.
[4:04:14] <Majiinbooh> doing this is so rewarding mentally lol
[4:04:15] <legendarysabertooth> It’s almost like he got carried by hive blood
[4:04:16] <%skizzuto> he doesn't need kingsoul path of pain gives you infinite soul totems
[4:04:25] <agustorm123> There is no way pat get this fast
[4:04:26] <+Walopoh> Pat Stares at Super Mario Maker part 155
[4:04:27] <Piejumper5814> you die at any point and you start here from square one
[4:04:29] <+BurncoatRapscallion> "hiveblood sucks" wastes soul and life
[4:04:35] <Majiinbooh> it took me like 6 hours to do the whole thing
[4:04:35] <ValidVenasaur> at least you hear this soothing song
[4:04:35] <%riantDeliration> its hard to actually DIE on Path of Pain, you just take damage over and over
[4:04:35] <+Ssaik> holy fuck
[4:04:35] <epylepticpanda> IF YOU DO THIS PAT, I'LL SUB FOR 6 MONTHS! I BELIEVE IN YOU
[4:04:41] <Envy_the_spider> so is it you have to do it one go?
[4:04:43] <grimporio> @Piejumper5814 not true
[4:04:46] <Tampaoster> This is perfect
[4:04:48] <hntronium> Let's go Patrick
[4:04:49] <+shawntk_> @epylepticpanda RIP
[4:04:50] <+ShikiHisashi> IT HAS BEGUN!
[4:04:53] <hiddenllama4> this was too tough for me
[4:04:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> SODIUM RISING
[4:04:59] <DivineDragoonKain> Pat there's a fight at the end of this that sends you to the beginning if you die
[4:05:00] <custoadian> there are checkpoints along the way, but the first section is pretty long
[4:05:06] <+keksisblyat> Well this music is.... fitting
[4:05:12] <shotgang86> if pat does this I'll sub,
[4:05:14] <Pigbuster> The first part is one of the most difficult, probably just to weed people out
[4:05:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> High blood pressure soon
[4:05:17] <Envy_the_spider> oof
[4:05:18] <AtlasMcCoy> LUL
[4:05:18] <energywarning> pat, if you beat this tonight, i'll continue watching and shitposting in all your chats!

[4:05:39] <strangelee> And this is just room 1
[4:05:40] <ooblagis> I for one never did this shit. I did the damn pantheons, but I didn't do this.
[4:05:44] <+conradical> if you crystal dash to the left from where you respawn, there's an unlimited soul statue
[4:05:44] <Piejumper5814> you hit zero masks and you start from here. that is including the combat section
[4:05:45] <%TheImmortal70> Alright folks, right now we got like 370$ on pat not doing this, so come on and join LUL
[4:05:45] <agustorm123> GIVE UP LUL
[4:05:47] <+NWR_James> Are ya winnin', son?
[4:05:48] <wunderkonig> can be done in 5 minutes but takes most people several hours
[4:05:51] <Tampaoster> its just like vini vidi vici on vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
[4:05:52] <ShawnEXE> @conradical all 5?

[4:06:04] <CeaselessSlick> !uptime
[4:06:04] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 6m 6s.
[4:06:04] <rhus> @AngriestPat if you find you need soul, crystal dash left from the checkpoint
[4:06:04] <XdaXcaptainX> i don't think this is gonna take pat as long as chat thinks it will. he has a weird knack for this
[4:06:07] <+ShikiHisashi> It can be done Pat!
[4:06:08] <+MiyamotoSensei> OLD MAN STILL BAD AT GAMES
[4:06:09] <$SGrim> He's becoming frazzled rooPog
[4:06:09] <Theoyveyman> @AngriestPat Will you do Godmaster on stream?
[4:06:09] <Donchalant402> @ooblagis final pantheon is bullshit
[4:06:13] <+Clik404> @ooblagis you did the fucking pantheons? all of them?
[4:06:13] <$wolfofsound> @fireking900 okay let's not be rash
[4:06:13] <Borealum_EX> BANG BANG BANG
[4:06:16] <DivineDragoonKain> dash left

[4:06:18] <agustorm123> Give up ginger boy LUL
[4:06:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> BOOMER PAT
[4:06:25] <legendarysabertooth> But I thought it wasn’t bad Pat
[4:06:29] <ooblagis> ALL the pantheons are bullshit
[4:06:32] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> That soul has infinite soul, IIRC
[4:06:33] <Majiinbooh> you were about half way to the next checkpoint at the farthest u got
[4:06:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> hahahha
[4:06:34] <ShawnEXE> @conradical nah I mean the dlc
[4:06:37] <AtlasMcCoy> Well it's called the path of pain not the path of gentile kisses
[4:06:41] <leole11> so far
[4:06:45] <blockedL> fhats why its painful
[4:06:45] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat There are checkpoints, but they're further in
[4:06:54] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Yeah it's Path of Pain
[4:06:57] <Parapattern> His smile and optimism, gone
[4:06:58] <Dr00_PhD> mash super dash on the wall so you don't have to wall jump as much
[4:07:00] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Not Path of Pillows
[4:07:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> isnt that great
[4:07:01] <leole11> WE DO IT
[4:07:03] <heatrashes> AAAAAAAAAAAAA
[4:07:04] <Bonobonobone> Woof
[4:07:04] <$wolfofsound> LUL
[4:07:04] <TheHolyCarrot> ooof
[4:07:04] <+NWR_James> UGH
[4:07:05] <ShawnEXE> ALL IN ONE GO
[4:07:06] <%AbnormalVoid> You're almost to the checkpoint
[4:07:07] <Majiinbooh> SO CLOSE
[4:07:09] <TheHolyCarrot> looks hard
[4:07:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> brutal
[4:07:10] <DivineDragoonKain> It gets worse
[4:07:11] <johnny2by4x6> rooSmug
[4:07:12] <%ArcanumMBD> WELCOME TO THE PATH PATRICK
[4:07:12] <wunderkonig> you're almost at a checkpoint
[4:07:12] <+th3madness> see, when people hype up white palace
[4:07:12] <%TheImmortal70> It wouldn't be a path if it wasn't one go
[4:07:13] <strangelee> It's called the Path of Pain
[4:07:15] <+ShikiHisashi> Almost there
[4:07:15] <blockedL> hes still doing it pretty well
[4:07:17] <+NWR_James> F
[4:07:17] <%mornerboi> YOU CAN DO IT LAAAAD
[4:07:17] <leole11> oh boy
[4:07:17] <+th3madness> they're thinking of path of pain
[4:07:18] <SatansDick1> e
[4:07:21] <scrumdrew> almost to the first checkpoint
[4:07:22] <@StridentSong> For those of you who don't know, this is the first part of 7 parts.
[4:07:23] <+Eeko390> Don't worry Pat. This is the easy part.
[4:07:24] <+Robo_Wizard1> well it's not called the Path of Pillows
[4:07:24] <$Mendin> This is the antechamber of the Path of Pain
[4:07:25] <Tampaoster> Hard plataforming
[4:07:25] <edward11231> Close to checkpoint
[4:07:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> PAT MAY CRY
[4:07:26] <powerprotoman> theres that clicking nosie with ya mouth again
[4:07:26] <dandyspider> path of PAIN
[4:07:26] <energywarning> the path of comfort
[4:07:26] <+Hotironclad> Man this music is very fitting LUL
[4:07:26] <Piejumper5814> its setting in
[4:07:29] <+Rolandknight> what the fuck it up with this level
[4:07:31] <+aversal_ammar> Just give up super hard
[4:07:36] <+NWR_James> Just imagine this is Sans
[4:07:36] <leole11> ABYSS SHREIK
[4:07:37] <%GummiBunnies> ANGRY SCREM LUL
[4:07:38] <+Quarkee> is this i wanna be the guy
[4:07:39] <Dunric_Mordamir> Your big and strong Pat you can do it!!
[4:07:40] <Daniel_Is_I> On the bright side, Deep Focus + Grubsong gives infinite attempts.
[4:07:41] <Tampaoster> This is not even there yet
[4:07:42] <+moosemonkey397> this is hard, but it doesnt look too bad, super doable
[4:07:42] <Theoyveyman> @AngriestPat Yeah you're gonna have to master the pogo jump for this
[4:07:42] <$wolfofsound> @StridentSong shit no wonder everyone was willing to bet so much
[4:07:50] <AtlasMcCoy> Really sets the mood doesnt it?
[4:07:52] <ShawnEXE> The shriek is actually a good stalling tool
[4:07:54] <SchroedingersFerret> Quit like a big HERO
[4:08:06] <+twohitgood> at the bug jumping, you're better off going left and down than using the three bugs to go up left then down.
[4:08:09] <deviljhojho94> Just forget about it patricio
[4:08:11] <@StridentSong> @wolfofsound Yea. Though I'm gonna give him $15 for every part he completes even if he quits
[4:08:12] <Diego_Umejuarez> just watched a video of someone doing this and uhhhhhhhh good fucking luck
[4:08:13] <leole11> "hiveblood is shit man"
[4:08:15] <epylepticpanda> Does anyone know if woolie finished the path of pain
[4:08:16] <ShawnEXE> I think it took me 2 and a half hours to do path of pain
[4:08:23] <wunderkonig> woolie played this?
[4:08:25] <leole11> @epylepticpanda pretty sure he hasn't been to white palace
[4:08:27] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Woolie didn't even do the white palace
[4:08:31] <@StridentSong> Woolie did not play this part
[4:08:34] <$Audega> I just came in and saw where he is and OH GOD
[4:08:36] <@StridentSong> He never got into the palace
[4:08:36] <Eresus> @wunderkonig nope
[4:08:38] <epylepticpanda> WHAT?!
[4:08:45] <agustorm123> Now sequence breack this Shit ginger boy LUL
[4:08:45] <+Roundelay11> Pat, you really shouldn't bother with this
[4:08:48] <AtlasMcCoy> Woolie is a HUGE coward compared to pat
[4:08:48] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Woolie said he didn't do the true end, and probably didn't care about it
[4:08:50] <leole11> @epylepticpanda he got ending 1, and called it a day
[4:08:54] <ooblagis> Woolie likely only got ending 1
[4:09:03] <AncelDeLambert> @angriestpat there IS an anti-knockback charm
[4:09:07] <ValidVenasaur> do this after the endings
[4:09:07] <ShawnEXE> Pat wants a taste
[4:09:12] <wunderkonig> Imagine if everyone else in the game can just fly. and the path of pain wasn't meant to be anywhere near this hard.
[4:09:12] <hntronium> Woolie just pulled a Matt
[4:09:13] <agustorm123> Dont go the woolie way
[4:09:17] <Parapattern> What a scrub lord
[4:09:18] <strangelee> What do you mean the challange will wait?
[4:09:21] <TheyCallMeVawn> Lmao "segment"
[4:09:21] <+Eeko390> It doesn't save
[4:09:22] <$RaikenTB> you need more red bull.
[4:09:23] <strangelee> This is the challange
[4:09:27] <agustorm123> Dont be a coward
[4:09:28] <CeaselessSlick> Wow wtf woolie
[4:09:30] <+BurncoatRapscallion> It's funny how some segments later are easier than this first one
[4:09:33] <+G_Thunders> Do you have to do this all in one go?
[4:09:34] <+Eeko390> You'll have to do it again anyways
[4:09:36] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat In this first part, dash and then air jump to get on that wall with the saw blade.
[4:09:37] <%mornerboi> that save was almost really clutch
[4:09:39] <+velemi> God, this music is beautiful
[4:09:43] <%mornerboi> and thats all that matters in your heart
[4:09:51] <+HypotheticalWalrus> after a while it all just becomes muscle memory
[4:09:52] <leole11> @velemi and the best part is that it gets better the more you play
[4:10:01] <%NobleJedi> close
[4:10:03] <+th3madness> fuck me, hollow knight really is a great game
[4:10:03] <agustorm123> Git gud pat
[4:10:05] <+brave_sj> I for one am totally down with Pat brute forcing his way through the entire path of pain tonight
[4:10:05] <%mattmanj17> this might not be worth it guys... we might be here to tommorow night
[4:10:05] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 I watch you because Woolie refuses to stream. You are my rebound streamer. Remember that.
[4:10:12] <+th3madness> I almost feel like you can skip the climb
[4:10:14] <+antoniojlopezm> Maybe get the anti-knockback charm?
[4:10:19] <ShawnEXE> This first segment is meant to discourage anyone who thinks they can do it
[4:10:22] <%TheImmortal70> Nope, vines can't be pogo'd
[4:10:23] <strangelee> Oh man, you can totally shadow dash through that gap in the vines, can't you
[4:10:23] <DivineDragoonKain> use your dash to clear that corner jump consistently
[4:10:23] <+th3madness> and just dash left to the wall after that first one
[4:10:25] <%TheImmortal70> So you can't skip
[4:10:26] <coolguyvince> were you about to sneeze
[4:10:36] <Kain5707> i remember a journalist said this game wasnt good because of this optional area
[4:10:42] <agustorm123> GIT FUCKING GUD you are almost there checkpoint near
[4:10:50] <%Sirculbs> Take a breather!
[4:11:00] <%mornerboi> Don't give up, Skeleton!
[4:11:02] <%TheImmortal70> I remember a journalist saying the music of DMC V wasn't that good LUL
[4:11:20] <Kain5707> @TheImmortal70 limesWot
[4:11:20] <AncelDeLambert> Pat, stop and read some donations, your hands are losing their strength
[4:11:23] <Eresus> @Kain5707 the path of pain? or the white palace? because path of pain is veeery well hidden and optional
[4:11:23] <%TheImmortal70> You know, the one that scales with combat ability Kappa
[4:11:24] <AtlasMcCoy> THERES STILL MORE
[4:11:26] <%AbnormalVoid> LUL
[4:11:26] <blockedL> i dash :)
[4:11:27] <Daniel_Is_I> TRIAL AND ERROR
[4:11:28] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat By dying
[4:11:28] <@StridentSong> You're not
[4:11:28] <TheHolyCarrot> LUL
[4:11:29] <strangelee> SUFFER
[4:11:29] <Theoyveyman> oof
[4:11:30] <DracaenaLeaf> gotta learn
[4:11:30] <fireking900> wtf LUL
[4:11:31] <xeros720> wow, gotta bounce off those
[4:11:32] <+moosemonkey397> you arent
[4:11:33] <OtterSlinger> This is why Super Meat Boy is super zoomed out, folks
[4:11:33] <Zanicedg> You're not supposed to know.
[4:11:33] <wunderkonig> you can't, it's just a love song to dragon's lair.
[4:11:33] <WaffleLeech> You know now
[4:11:34] <+Roundelay11> Trial and error
[4:11:35] <ShawnEXE> there's a reason it's called Path of Pain
[4:11:35] <MiraiUsagi> now you know
[4:11:35] <SatansDick1> trial and error
[4:11:36] <Theoyveyman> O O F
[4:11:36] <@StridentSong> It's literally Meat Boy. Learn by dying
[4:11:36] <Majiinbooh> you were one screen away from checkpoint
[4:11:37] <Tampaoster> NOw you know
[4:11:39] <%Enderborn18> No voice to cry suffering...
[4:11:39] <powerprotoman> what part of pain didnt you get?
[4:11:40] <Envy_the_spider> rip
[4:11:40] <%skizzuto> that's why this is punishment
[4:11:41] <%TheImmortal70> FAIL FARTO
[4:11:43] <TheHolyCarrot> Pat looks like Paul Giamatti right now
[4:11:43] <ekkieekk> paaain
[4:11:44] <%TheImmortal70> FAIL AND LEARN
[4:11:44] <agustorm123> Almost there
[4:11:44] <dalishprince> gotta suffer to learn!!
[4:11:44] <+Grayhammatter> O O F
[4:11:44] <%Sirculbs> Trial and error. They expect you to fail many times
[4:11:45] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Doing this on a handheld switch can kill your hands
[4:11:46] <+th3madness> see, with white palace they had to hold back because the true end is locked behind it
[4:11:48] <+velemi> You aren't, you're supposed to suffer
[4:11:48] <ooblagis> I remember a journo telling me Deadcells was good, so they can't be all bad.
[4:11:49] <Piejumper5814> through pain.
[4:11:52] <+brave_sj> Just don't touch the buzzsaws 4Head
[4:11:53] <+Ramsus88> you can double jump after falling a bit to be cautious
[4:11:55] <+th3madness> this they can just tell you to fuck yourself
[4:11:58] <xeros720> i forget, did pat say he liked meat boy?
[4:11:58] <+Cervarian> I am clenching so hard danButt
[4:11:59] <damienlunas> You have surpassed Meat Boy and reached IWTBTG
[4:12:01] <agustorm123> On switch it will break it LUL
[4:12:01] <wunderkonig> doing this on a controller almost killed my hands
[4:12:03] <+Ramsus88> it's not necessarily trial and error
[4:12:03] <%JJCheeker> This game has by far the hardest platforming I've ever seen in a game
[4:12:03] <$TheNeedlesD> It's almost like it's called the Path of Pain for a reason.
[4:12:04] <%TheImmortal70> Not all games journalists are incompetent
[4:12:04] <+xXCrustybunsXx> PoP has a separate reward yeah?
[4:12:09] <wunderkonig> ....can't wait until I see the guitar hero version
[4:12:10] <%TheImmortal70> But a vast majority are
[4:12:11] <%Kghaleon> Don't die on stream pat
[4:12:12] <Kain5707> @Eresus im not sure if they said white palace as a whole or path of pain
[4:12:14] <fireking900> just dont die 4Head
[4:12:14] <hntronium> Don't let the annoyance set in Pat, that's the worst that could happen
[4:12:15] <legendarysabertooth> At least you can’t die
[4:12:16] <%nitronLVIII> this is like watching me try to play fighting games
[4:12:20] <+th3madness> nice save
[4:12:23] <leole11> PoP has something that could barely be considered a reward
[4:12:25] <hntronium> Just keep cool
[4:12:29] <DivineDragoonKain> the reward for this is a lore entry
[4:12:30] <$Mendin> He's hollowing out and accepting the Light
[4:12:31] <+CharredChord> there is nothing but a butscene at the end of this
[4:12:31] <%mornerboi> are we starting a betting pool for if pat's heart explodes trying this
[4:12:32] <%Piemen99> Question what's pat's death count
[4:12:35] <%TheImmortal70> Oh but you can win at fighting games, this however, there is no victory
[4:12:36] <+Corvax__> If you watch closely you can see pats souls leaving his body with each fail
[4:12:39] <+Ramsus88> you can also just anticipate them being dicks
[4:12:40] <DXLelouch24> Pat this isnt worththe pain
[4:12:47] <DXLelouch24> the reward sucks
[4:12:49] <Zanicedg> Mark of pride really isn't a good idea for this IMO.
[4:12:51] <+th3madness> wow
[4:12:52] <Bonobonobone> PogChamp
[4:12:52] <%Enderborn18> ay

[4:13:45] <+th3madness> DO IT FOR SPITE
[4:13:45] <AtlasMcCoy> No the actual reward is people giving you a lot of money to do it
[4:13:46] <+SWindleFeD> There's no way to cancel the super dash is there?
[4:13:47] <%Tredecian> and the money
[4:13:48] <PSI_Guy95> ah, spite
[4:13:48] <ShawnEXE> LUL
[4:13:49] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Hey man, you ever want to stream/play Celeste?
[4:13:49] <like_5000_people> the actual reward is the money
[4:13:50] <+SuperMonkey2> the reward is a sense of pride and accomplishment
[4:13:52] <Skeletonmanners> do the trial of fools next then
[4:13:54] <+NWR_James> did the chat bet money on this?
[4:13:55] <+th3madness> money and spite
[4:13:56] <Dunric_Mordamir> plus the 400$ helps a lot
[4:13:57] <$RaikenTB> you can't do it, Pat.

[4:13:58] <%riantDeliration> spite and money are the best motivators

[4:14:07] <damienlunas> I'm not gonna commit that much but I'll bet like $10 he doesn't make it
[4:14:07] <%Sirculbs> The spite is strong!
[4:14:07] <%Dimfish> the actual reward is like 400 dollars at thisbpoint
[4:14:10] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat fuckin take my money
[4:14:10] <+brave_sj> The reward is several hundred real world dollars apparently. Mine included
[4:14:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> basically "DON'T TELL MEH WAT I CAN'T DOOO!"
[4:14:11] <element_of_loyalty> Elmo helps

[4:19:55] <DracaenaLeaf> He's like a third of the way done
[4:19:56] <+LtShuckle> @AngriestPat do it to shit on woolie
[4:19:58] <+Robo_Wizard1> @mendin I don't think Woolie even knows about the white palace
[4:20:02] <vampireinarm> F

[4:20:02] <@StridentSong> DO IT FOR PAI-... DO IT FOR ELMO

[4:20:41] <8BitDsx> Super Meat Boy Stream when?
[4:20:42] <+Robo_Wizard1> what's "beating" meat boy? light world or dark world? Hell isn't even close
[4:20:42] <%Agami23> if they ever made a super meat boy 2. i would love it if they added the hollow knight
[4:20:43] <element_of_loyalty> Never played Meatboy
[4:20:43] <fore1gn3r> super meat boy is easier then this honestly
[4:20:43] <agustorm123> This is better
[4:20:44] <xeros720> oh, if you beat all of normal, that's fine
[4:20:45] <%drfaustisdead> @AngriestPat Do you think DMCV can set a new standard for character action animation porn?
[4:20:46] <aeonicvector> if you can beat this you can def beat meatboy, (and hell is the HARDEST part of the game, next chapters are joke)
[4:20:48] <@StridentSong> That's actually fairly impressive
[4:20:49] <+jyrecko> nerver beat dr.fetus myself
[4:20:51] <epylepticpanda> DO IT FOR ELMO'S PEEPEE
[4:20:52] <$magikestral> smb glitched on me and i couldn't beat the hell boss because meatboy kept bouncing
[4:20:54] <Diego_Umejuarez> tilt is coming
[4:20:54] <xeros720> hell is some serious shit, i feel like i nearly died doing them
[4:20:54] <Tampaoster> meat go big
[4:20:54] <+BurncoatRapscallion> I honestly would have liked if they foreshadowed the saws in a boss fight or another area because they're SO out of place
[4:20:55] <+NWR_James> MAKE PAIGE PLAY MEATBOY
[4:20:56] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat super meat boy Lp when? rooPog
[4:20:56] <%Hilleltaco> I beat the normal levels but never managed the dark levels
[4:21:00] <Darthkitten_Prime> Hell is about the halfway point of Super Meat Boy.
[4:21:00] <+HypotheticalWalrus> anyone who beats smb is actually a masochist
[4:21:01] <SkullKingKota> YOU CAN DO IT!!!!!!
[4:21:01] <+Wafflum> cheer500 Who would win? A million buzzsaw and countless thorns, or one nail boi?

[4:21:34] <Tampaoster> Time for the pain
[4:21:46] <leole11> @NWR_James I think the worst part is just the end bit
[4:21:47] <%TheImmortal70> @sotetsu Oh he beat white palace. This is PATH OF PAIN
[4:21:47] <+G_Thunders> @burncoatrapscallion I think they just needed an obstacle that wasn’t vines. The devs said they made white palace in like 4 days
[4:21:48] <wunderkonig> it is possible to shinespark behind the top chainsaw, stop, and then pogo off a lower one, but no, just no.
[4:21:50] <%TheImmortal70> For over 400$
[4:21:50] <%theblackgoddess> at least theres super beautiful music
[4:21:55] <xxxkeelamxxx> Pain is a state of mind
[4:21:57] <SatansDick1> hey pat you should challenge woolie and make him do path of pain
[4:22:07] <+TheBroletariat> That’s weird, I don’t think SMB is that bad but PoP gave me way more trouble than it’s giving you
[4:22:07] <agustorm123> There is a way to beat this ez pat
[4:22:08] <Eresus> @Sotetsu he beat white palace, this is path of pain

[4:26:03] <bloodypurpledog> PAT U TRULY ARE THE GG ALLIN OF HOLLOW KNIGHT
[4:26:04] <+ZeOrbling> tell us the truth, PAIGE is actually playing isnt she

[4:26:17] <SwindlerOfProgress> Nah, they're just hard.
[4:26:18] <DXLelouch24> Pat dont tempt Cherry
[4:26:19] <$magikestral> nah, you can understand them, theyre just hard
[4:26:19] <wunderkonig> no it's all rather straightforward, but it's just really hard timing
[4:26:22] <fore1gn3r> USE SUPER DASH TO STICK TO A WALL AND WAIT OUT THE SAW
[4:26:24] <+GuelermeDias> the game also kinda gives you generous checkpoints unless you're braindead
[4:26:26] <+BishopBain> LUL
[4:26:28] <%Agami23> you still havent figured out this one pat. your sequence breaking.
[4:26:32] <+Walopoh> This is all prerecorded that's why you can't see his hands
[4:26:35] <DXLelouch24> we still have Hornet DLC
[4:26:38] <SeventyForce> Soo, we scating stream now?
[4:26:40] <MiraiUsagi> well pat isnt actually figuring the jumps out, he is making his own jumps
[4:26:47] <bloodypurpledog> There's blood and shit everywhere
[4:26:47] <+antoniojlopezm> Just let him sequence break it if the man wants to man
[4:26:49] <vampireinarm> L E F T

[4:26:52] <+Corvax__> some
[4:26:52] <leole11> just go left
[4:26:53] <LtThunderbolt> when Pat reads your comment iddGasm
[4:26:54] <%riantDeliration> many of them yes
[4:26:54] <agustorm123> Patt is breacking the game
[4:26:54] <ValidVenasaur> no
[4:26:54] <Tampaoster> brute skills
[4:26:55] <like_5000_people> a lot of them
[4:26:55] <AtlasMcCoy> Some

[4:26:57] <+brave_sj> A fair bit
[4:26:57] <@StridentSong> Some of them, yes.
[4:26:57] <$magikestral> when the two saws meet, go left
[4:26:58] <AncelDeLambert> sequence breaking BIG TIME
[4:26:58] <WaffleLeech> Everyone underestimated your pogo abilities
[4:26:59] <+th3madness> this one especiallt
[4:27:00] <%Dimfish> some yea
[4:27:01] <aeonicvector> alot, its hysterical
[4:27:01] <+GuelermeDias> if you can sequence break shit it's a failure of the game designer
[4:27:02] <Zanicedg> Not really.
[4:27:02] <leole11> no, just this one
[4:27:02] <+moosemonkey397> maybe thats better. pat winning so hard he doesnt even care
[4:27:03] <DXLelouch24> oh so hes cheating?
[4:27:03] <wunderkonig> both ways are fine
[4:27:04] <+solipants> you're doing fine, there is a way left though
[4:27:05] <epylepticpanda> BRUTE SMARTS
[4:27:05] <+yet_another_brony> in hollow night, theres really no such thing as sequence breaking
[4:27:06] <LokimenD> Pat is just that good
[4:27:06] <johnny2by4x6> It just works chat
[4:27:07] <zal_silverfang> @antoniojlopezm we arent complaining we are just telling him
[4:27:09] <$shadow1man9> @AngriestPat That's what you're supposed to do, chat is japes
[4:27:09] <wunderkonig> if it's not a glitch it's not sequence breaking
[4:27:10] <%Agami23> you arnt supposed to pogo. the way you are doing it is impresseive to say the least
[4:27:12] <+yet_another_brony> its all up to you
[4:27:16] <$rdark_ksu> you have kind of made it an art and its getting to be frustrating
[4:27:18] <%Spydurman> can't you ride those blades up with the Nail?
[4:27:18] <+th3madness> you're supposed to go left

[4:27:29] <+antoniojlopezm> @zal_silverfang they are literally calling him dumb for not going right, and saying it's annoying lol
[4:27:30] <%TheImmortal70> I swear I can feel pat forcing it
[4:27:32] <+timblenaut> can we kick mods?
[4:27:32] <@StridentSong> /ban Ssaryn
[4:27:33] <DonatelloJose> sipsipRude

[4:27:38] <+GuelermeDias> also what pogoing seems like the easiest solution you dumbasses
[4:27:39] <coolguyvince> he really has not sequence broken much idk why chat is saying that

[4:27:56] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat you and Paige are like 2 peas in a pod, twin fish in a pond, two twins in a womb... wait rooWut
[4:27:58] <%ECRead> is it possible to ride the saw up or can you not swing fast enough, i wonder
[4:27:59] <%Sirculbs> apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhead
[4:28:06] <strangelee> @AngriestPat I disagree, the nail bounce is intended play. It has high level play use for platforming.
[4:28:09] <+th3madness> seriously
[4:28:11] <Tampaoster> AHAHAH HE GOT IT
[4:28:11] <%riantDeliration> cant swing nearly fast enough
[4:28:11] <+Robo_Wizard1> PAT
[4:28:11] <+th3madness> SERIOUSLY
[4:28:13] <zal_silverfang> @antoniojlopezm heh you must be new here. this is old lore of shitting on pat and he shits on us back. it's basically a fun game

[4:28:16] <+dirtyh4rr1> BLIND
[4:28:17] <+Zeromaru2> How?
[4:28:18] <leole11> the key to this is find consistency, and this strategy has only worked once every 10
[4:28:19] <+JustToWatch> BRUTE SMARTS
[4:28:20] <vampireinarm> INSIGHT GO UP

[4:28:23] <Kain5707> vineBlind
[4:28:25] <wunderkonig> the nail bounce is required here
[4:28:26] <$SGrim> rooBlind
[4:28:26] <agustorm123> This is taking way longer and is super ez compared to those other seccions
[4:28:30] <+GuelermeDias> i mean it only needs to work once
[4:28:32] <@SSaryn> Hey, stupid question, but without hidden dreams, has the dream stuff been there before that?
[4:28:32] <+th3madness> this is why we doubt you pat
[4:28:33] <XdaXcaptainX> nut why take the sissy baby intended path when you can WIN
[4:28:37] <XdaXcaptainX> BUT**
[4:28:37] <hellfirejefe> the madman is actually doing the path of pain?!
[4:28:40] <%TheMattman1313> Oh man I can't wait for you to finish this so we can watch a 100% speedrun that includes this.
[4:28:41] <Dunric_Mordamir> Cheat all the way to victory Pat!!!
[4:28:41] <ValidVenasaur> TIP: You can repeatedly tap the shinespark button to stay in place on the wall instead of walljumping all the time
[4:28:42] <LtThunderbolt> nic
[4:28:46] <leole11> sure, but if you can only try once every 10, it takes way longer
[4:28:48] <hntronium> @SSaryn Some iirc
[4:28:51] <Tampaoster> The breaker of sequencies
[4:28:56] <+yet_another_brony> EVEN THATS NOT THE INTENDED PATH
[4:28:58] <AtlasMcCoy> So we're getting a steel soul run after right?
[4:29:03] <rathma301> you can just hold down the button to not crystal dash
[4:29:04] <LtThunderbolt> wow
[4:29:05] <Sotetsu> Is there a playlist with all of Pat's Hollow Knight playthroughs?

[4:31:08] <Tampaoster> @DraxTD Just chugged them all
[4:31:13] <$Mendin> He beat white palace, said "Oh I was expecting worse" and people slapped 400 bucks on the table and said "Do Path of Pain you coward"
[4:31:13] <+th3madness> he's doing this out of spite
[4:31:20] <+G_Thunders> Seeing pat sequence break this makes me want to go back and try it
[4:31:22] <@thenefftw> This music would sound so tragic if it wasn't for the goddamn buzz saws
[4:31:25] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat you can repeatedly tap the crystal dash button on the wall to stay in place so you dont have to jump
[4:31:28] <Tampaoster> And for 400 bucks
[4:31:35] <agustorm123> If patt keeps doing his zawarudo shit on this place he is going to get more insane
[4:31:37] <wunderkonig> I'd try again but only if I record the entire game up to that point.
[4:31:38] <fore1gn3r> use super dash to stick to walls
[4:31:42] <$magikestral> @mendin to be fair the bets happened before he even got to WP
[4:31:43] <Tampaoster> we waged that he wouldn't do it
[4:31:46] <Sotetsu> I wish the buzz saw starting positions reset on death so it was easier to get into a groove and repeat.
[4:31:48] <%lutefiiisk> I'm having problems with Hornet 2, and Pat is just breezing through this...
[4:31:50] <%Cobra743> for some reason even if i put in 400 bits it dosen't let me hit the submit button to donate.......
[4:31:50] <+sparkletone> i actually turned the sfx volume leve in the game down by like 50% when i did this, thenefftw
[4:31:52] <hellfirejefe> this is some maddening shit if you're doing it without anything playing in the background
[4:31:56] <SwindlerOfProgress> @thenefftw It'll have a more appropriate moment later on. I forgot it even played here.
[4:31:56] <grayjammer> Patrick "Free Money" Fuckboivin: You are good at video games and I beleieve in you
[4:32:03] <+HypotheticalWalrus> Im pretty sure I ended up hearing those buzzsaws in my dreams when I did it
[4:32:04] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat you can repeatedly tap the crystal dash button on the wall to stay in place so you dont have to jump
[4:32:06] <+sparkletone> partly because it took me hours and i got sick of the saw whine, partly because the music is so pretty
[4:32:08] <%Tredecian> it isnt
[4:32:20] <Tampaoster> This chill Ost is just maddening
[4:32:20] <leole11> there's a timing to it, if you figure it out, it's way easier
[4:32:22] <Theoyveyman> God this is like watching a really long GIF
[4:32:23] <+th3madness> so, here we still are
[4:32:28] <%TheImmortal70> Who's giving pat tips!
[4:32:29] <agustorm123> The saws are the best soundtrack fuck you guys
[4:32:29] <$Mendin> I mean Pat is basically a Spite Elemental so everyone shitting on him to fail this only empowers him
[4:32:30] <+GuelermeDias> here's my pro tip: give up, be a bitch
[4:32:35] <Theoyveyman> Just loops over and over
[4:32:37] <hellfirejefe> i think i repressed every memory i have of this place
[4:32:42] <+Grayhammatter> only loops
[4:32:46] <hntronium> Its kind of easier than the nail bounce you've been doing depending on timing
[4:32:48] <Tampaoster> Welcome to hell
[4:32:51] <Parapattern> The hubris of one man
[4:32:51] <epylepticpanda> DON'T BE LIKE WOOLIE
[4:32:52] <Dunric_Mordamir> @GuelermeDias Nah
[4:32:55] <+th3madness> note pat's lack of progress since he said this wasn't as hard
[4:32:56] <%TheImmortal70> FUCKIN DAMMIT
[4:32:58] <Tampaoster> Pat will be your guide
[4:32:59] <+GuelermeDias> no be a coward
[4:33:05] <%Sirculbs> @mendin But that is cancelled out by crazy talk fucking him when he said it wasn't as bad as he expected
[4:33:06] <+GuelermeDias> just give up
[4:33:12] <EMP_Ike_Turner> the biggest backdown
[4:33:15] <hellfirejefe> no cost too great i guess
[4:33:19] <Dunric_Mordamir> DO IT PAT!
[4:33:21] <%TheImmortal70> No cost too great
[4:33:25] <hntronium> I did this way easier on the intended path because I couldn't get the timing for the nail bounce
[4:33:28] <agustorm123> Patt”this wasn’t as hard” ginger man last words
[4:33:28] <Tampaoster> The biggest of paybacks
[4:33:34] <+Grayhammatter> you got this boivin!
[4:33:36] <%lutefiiisk> Wait, you can hang on by rapidly canceling crystal burst?
[4:33:55] <+GuelermeDias> it's not really much better considering you lose height
[4:34:04] <epylepticpanda> THIS IS THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY
[4:34:13] <J1LL3O> "This isn't that hard" - Man who found out it was that hard
[4:34:14] <+Gorgen> SUFFER MORE
[4:34:14] <Tampaoster> BREAKING NEWS: GINGER MAN SAID TOO MUCH SHIT ABOUT GAME, GAME BEAT UP GINGER MAN BADLY
[4:34:17] <ooblagis> you have to just go for it
[4:34:17] <EMP_Ike_Turner> I bet Skelmo could do it
[4:34:18] <Theoyveyman> at this point Crazy Talk has bent over backwords, proving Pat right & wrong in multiple times in a row
[4:34:18] <Diego_Umejuarez> had he even tried dashing past that blade yet
[4:34:20] <hntronium> Take a minute or two to chill out pat
[4:34:21] <%Enderborn18> *sad violins intensify*

[4:34:59] <+GuelermeDias> you just kinda need to time a big jump just as the buzzsaw is going past you
[4:35:00] <grayjammer> Mmmhmm

[4:35:03] <DXLelouch24> guess Pat got cocky

[4:38:51] <grayjammer> Gotta stop edgin'
[4:38:55] <wunderkonig> the last stretch will break your controller
[4:38:55] <Horificius> !cheer2
[4:39:03] <%Jpdodds> is the shoulder rub the new nose scratch
[4:39:03] <%Tredecian> crystal dash
[4:39:05] <+th3madness> hiveblood was better
[4:39:08] <+th3madness> they nerfed it
[4:39:08] <+solipants> i needed the hive thing cause im bad
[4:39:09] <+SPplayer> Did you finish the event in warframe pat?
[4:39:10] <+HypotheticalWalrus> no point in path of pain, they give you infinite soul
[4:39:11] <SatansDick1> crystal dash at the first part @AngriestPat
[4:39:11] <$magikestral> hivething isn't necessary with infinite soul
[4:39:12] <aeonicvector> i perfer having to take a breather, but different strokes
[4:39:12] <+GuelermeDias> that jump isn't real pat
[4:39:16] <hntronium> It forces you to chill for a moment.
[4:39:18] <AncelDeLambert> it lets your hands rest, genius
[4:39:20] <Kain5707> were those health statues always there?
[4:39:22] <agustorm123> But patt it was easier yeah path easier
[4:39:22] <thisisacoolguy> hiveblood is also known as the sonicfoxblood
[4:39:27] <Theoyveyman> CRAZY TALKS LIMIT IS TESTED HERE & NOW
[4:39:30] <@StridentSong> hiveblood is ideal since you would technically never die. But given that your streaming, it would be boring as fuck
[4:39:30] <bazeljuice> Hive is really only good for white palace
[4:39:31] <%TheMattman1313> Not if you don't die within like 10 seconds.
[4:39:31] <hntronium> And for me, taking a moment to think things through really helped me
[4:39:33] <%lutefiiisk> What is this trial called?
[4:39:34] <MelBrooksKA> You don't have rhythm Pat
[4:39:35] <DXLelouch24> will Pat get Midir"d by Kingsmould?
[4:39:37] <hellfirejefe> i think i spent an hour on this part alone
[4:39:38] <+conradical> hiveblood recovery is just long enough that if you reliably make it to the second set of spears after the three walls, you got it back
[4:39:39] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Pat hates the crystal dash ability, it's the only answer for why he doesn't like to use it
[4:39:41] <+GuelermeDias> this is the trial of pat
[4:39:43] <aeonicvector> @lutefiiisk Path of Pain
[4:39:43] <SwindlerOfProgress> With your current set, you have functionally infinite soul, so it doesn't really matter.
[4:39:47] <resstarr> "fun"
[4:39:47] <+GuelermeDias> you don't
[4:39:49] <VoyRising> IF you walk without rhythm, you won't attract the worm.
[4:39:52] <SatansDick1> but pat youre white. you dont rhytm
[4:39:54] <+GuelermeDias> you're the whitest human on earth
[4:39:55] <%Dimfish> 'fun'
[4:39:55] <%Kghaleon> Mondays podcast will be fun
[4:39:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> fun
[4:40:09] <Tampaoster> This is rhythm of the night
[4:40:13] <wunderkonig> @AngriestPat imagine doing that bouncing with the short nail

[4:40:31] <deviljhojho94> NO COST TOO GREAT
[4:40:32] <AncelDeLambert> BAM, right into it
[4:40:32] <+conradical> i actually think longnail and mark of pride make this part harder
[4:40:32] <+brave_sj> You have all the rhythm of a balding ginger man, which is to say, none
[4:40:33] <grayjammer> It gets Fucked-er
[4:40:34] <OtterSlinger> This is worse than the Yoku Blocks in the first Mega Man Gameboy game
[4:40:35] <Tampaoster> pat go down
[4:40:35] <0rond> does he have both longnail and mark of pride?
[4:40:37] <+Corvax__> gotta take it slow but not too slow

[4:40:46] <edward11231> Easier right? Kappa
[4:40:46] <agustorm123> Really easier
[4:40:49] <orlauncelot> payment much large
[4:40:49] <%lutefiiisk> No achivement for Path of Pain. I wanted to see how his chances were
[4:40:50] <MelBrooksKA> Pat you don't live music, it's impossible for you to have rhythm
[4:40:51] <Tampaoster> PAIN GO UP

[4:48:46] <AtlasMcCoy> @AngriestPat So since this was added with the grimm troupe, you could say that this is the platforming equivalent of nightmare king grimm.
[4:48:47] <hellfirejefe> no cock too great
[4:48:47] <+conradical> it's been what, an hour since he started PoP?
[4:48:48] <jordanj4444> How in the absolute HELL are you supposed to do that next part?!

[4:49:02] <%ArcanumMBD> IM NOT UPSET PAT IS DOING THIS FASTER THAN I DID. WHY WOULD ANY OF YOU THINK THAT?
[4:49:03] <ooblagis> NKG isn't that bad
[4:49:10] <Donchalant402> stay healed up pat @AngriestPat
[4:49:12] <ChucklesTheBeard> @ArcanumMBD same tbh
[4:49:17] <$magikestral> pat is gonna forget to heal and die
[4:49:18] <+PapaGravestone> i actually gasped
[4:49:18] <%TheImmortal70> After playing Radiant fights in Godmaster, Nightmare king grimm is EASY
[4:49:20] <Tampaoster> i'm in love with the pain
[4:49:25] <ChucklesTheBeard> @Donchalant402 shush you it'll be hilarious
[4:49:26] <Tampaoster> PAIN GO UP
[4:49:27] <PumaOfDarkness> Just ask big bro Paige to do it.
[4:49:30] <AtlasMcCoy> NKG is literally so bad the devs gave you a backdown option if you couldnt beat him
[4:49:30] <deviljhojho94> This is some Lisa shit
[4:49:32] <hntronium> I'm not upset because I didn't time how long I did it.
[4:49:42] <Donchalant402> @ChucklesTheBeard it would kill me inside
[4:49:46] <wunderkonig> @jordanj4444 pogo on lower sawtwice, dash under upper saw, double jump into pogoing on upper saw, pogo twice, dash right, pogo on lower saw double jump to position, dash right through twin saws.
[4:49:46] <+jyrecko> hell, nightmare king is easy after pure vessel
[4:49:48] <ChucklesTheBeard> LUL
[4:49:53] <awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 just got out of work 45 min ago, only place open this late was McD (Blessed be Paige's name), and they wouldn't let me walk through the drive through, luckily a stranger let me into his car so i could order.
[4:50:03] <VoyRising> What's the reward for doing all this?
[4:50:07] <+BurncoatRapscallion> I feel like he could have delivered the flower by now
[4:50:08] <+G_Thunders> When people say NKG isn’t bad, that’s like saying orphan of Kos wasn’t bad. There’s always gonna be like 2% of people where a boss fight clicks right away
[4:50:08] <Tampaoster> Jump man nug bam
[4:50:09] <AtlasMcCoy> @VoyRising Lore
[4:50:09] <+th3madness> NOTHING
[4:50:11] <XdaXcaptainX> smol lore
[4:50:12] <Diego_Umejuarez> shutouts to crazy talk
[4:50:13] <Eresus> @VoyRising 2 seconds of lore
[4:50:14] <ChucklesTheBeard> @VoyRising like 2 seconds of lore and that's it
[4:50:17] <+th3madness> and 400 bucks I guess
[4:50:19] <hntronium> @awsomesaucekirby They wouldn't let you order inside?
[4:50:20] <VoyRising> Glorious.
[4:50:20] <AtlasMcCoy> @VoyRising Also people donating hundreds of dollars
[4:50:21] <element_of_loyalty> there's no reward?
[4:50:25] <%Sirculbs> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace
[4:50:28] <deviljhojho94> He was promised cash
[4:50:30] <%TheImmortal70> Why did you just go inside?
[4:50:31] <+NWR_James> ....WHAT
[4:50:31] <ooblagis> NKG reminds me of Manus, he's so fun that any deaths don't matter, because you enjoy them
[4:50:34] <Dunric_Mordamir> @element_of_loyalty not really
[4:50:37] <%GarbageNirvana> That's...scary
[4:50:40] <+Ramsus88> imo pure vessel is harder cuz you can't immediately retry the fight
[4:50:41] <@StridentSong> It's a safety Hazard
[4:50:44] <+ruddyredbone> why cant you go inside
[4:50:45] <Tampaoster> @GarbageNirvana BLAZE IT MAH DUDE
[4:50:46] <zal_silverfang> Pat. you need a CAR
[4:50:48] <+conradical> it's been about 50 minutes since he started this
[4:50:50] <%TheImmortal70> Why can't you go inside?
[4:50:50] <WaffleLeech> No that's fucked up you got in someone elses car
[4:50:51] <+conradical> i think
[4:50:55] <energywarning> don't go into stranger's cars tho. only if the stranger offers you candy.
[4:50:56] <+conradical> maybe an hour
[4:50:56] <%riantDeliration> @TheImmortal70 the inside closes at a certain time
[4:50:57] <hntronium> The McD's here is open 24/7
[4:50:59] <@StridentSong> They can't legally allow you to because it's a morotpath
[4:50:59] <+Fyre_link> Most places don't let you through on foot
[4:51:00] <%GarbageNirvana> It's legal in my state, I should blaze it more often
[4:51:01] <%TheImmortal70> that is stupid
[4:51:02] <+HunterInABox> @ruddyredbone Some places go drive thru only at certain times
[4:51:03] <AncelDeLambert> it's because they're required to log time waiting
[4:51:03] <@StridentSong> motorpath^
[4:51:04] <+Robo_Wizard1> that's how drive throughs work everywhere, it's a safety thing
[4:51:14] <EMP_Ike_Turner> CiGrip
[4:51:15] <AncelDeLambert> it's dumb, but it's safety and efficiency rules
[4:51:16] <%Sirculbs> "safety hazard" meaning hazardous for them cause they cant track u down from ur license plate if you pull some shit
[4:51:17] <hellfirejefe> no cost to great for mcdonalds i guess
[4:51:17] <%AllYouCanYeet> It's a DRIVE through not a WALK thru
[4:51:19] <$magikestral> i hit myself on those last spikes too many times
[4:51:19] <SatansDick1> so after path of pain is the true ending right
[4:51:27] <%GarbageNirvana> Also yeah they wouldn't even let me bike through one
[4:51:28] <fillamar> better be
[4:51:31] <%lutefiiisk> apatLiz WALK WITH ME IN HELL apatLiz

[4:52:06] <fillamar> its like 5
[4:52:12] <$magikestral> you never want to have less than one health here
[4:52:13] <+conradical> @AngriestPat there's really no reason why you shouldn't make each attempt at full health tbh
[4:52:23] <epylepticpanda> IM SURPRISED PAT HASN'T DESCENDED INTO MADNESS
[4:52:27] <%GarbageNirvana> I just got done with it myself and you get a free gun out of the deal, so
[4:52:42] <$actionhank87> Who do i have to whore myself out to, to get a gifted sub?
[4:52:42] <mistspade> I've had like 7 different kids try coming through drive on foot and nearly gotten run over because of it.
[4:52:42] <%Dimfish> pats loving this secretly
[4:52:43] <wunderkonig> good thing darksouls has no platforming huh
[4:52:45] <Theoyveyman> Each time Pat fucks up, he hollows out more & more
[4:52:46] <+TransporterX7> There is also no real reason why he shouldn't just go when over half health, lol
[4:52:46] <%MelBrooksKA> Because I'm poor and now that I have a job I'm even more paranoid about my money @StridentSong
[4:52:49] <ChucklesTheBeard> @conradical shush you, it happened to me there's no reason he shouldn't suffer too SwiftRage
[4:52:49] <wunderkonig> this is like sen's fortress on steroids.
[4:52:50] <%Sirculbs> He should ingest some delicious delicious red bull to make him big and strong for the remainder of this trial

[4:57:04] <SatansDick1> when you beat this you should shit in woolie on the podcast
[4:57:07] <AtlasMcCoy> To be fair, I think it's intended for the path of pain to just drain your soul over time and make itself harder.
[4:57:10] <%TheImmortal70> It's been about an hour and a half of THIS section I think
[4:57:10] <%gingergaming8> I feel like "path of pain" undersold it

[4:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 5 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 20oz (600mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[5:00:02] <hntronium> @Stay_Hydrated_Bot Good Job Bot
[5:00:02] <ChucklesTheBeard> @element_of_loyalty being able to say you did it is worth it.
[5:00:03] <+antoniojlopezm> The ending doesn't matter anymore
[5:00:04] <+HypotheticalWalrus> I love how people complained about the Colosseum and the white palace being too hard so team cherry just doubled down
[5:00:04] <Donchalant402> pat is getting worst on each run
[5:00:05] <xeros720> i agree with G_Thunders, helps to think of something else
[5:00:08] <wunderkonig> @element_of_loyalty why do you think that when the chat asked if it was worth it on a scale of one to ten we all answered 0.

[5:00:22] <+G_Thunders> The ending isn’t gonna make any sense, since he hasn’t seen where the music plays in the main game
[5:00:26] <Envy_the_spider> how far is he dose he have to go?
[5:00:27] <%Dimfish> @element_of_loyalty people bet like 400 bucks on him finishing it, the ending for pat is getting paid lol
[5:00:31] <agustorm123> This remember me when I found all the koroks shits on botw fucking wasn’t worth it at all

[5:01:16] <Piejumper5814> @angriestpat don't settle into a rhythm or youll ease into the same motions that will make it so that you make common mistakes far more often

[5:03:04] <+conradical> has he done the flower quest yet?
[5:03:09] <XdaXcaptainX> my new head canon is that pat is biblical sampson, weakened from the loss of his hair, clinging to the last vestiges of power granted to him by his nearly bald pate
[5:03:09] <AtlasMcCoy> No
[5:03:09] <%TheImmortal70> A toast to Pat's eternal failures! Kappa
[5:03:15] <+Corvax__> ya the timing of that spike gave me so much trouble

[5:12:41] <cintra212> That was THE Hollow Knight. He isn't completely hollow cuz he loves his daddy. :(
[5:12:42] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat he's one of the vessels meant to contain the infection. Hollow Knight if the first successful vessel

[5:22:29] <%Tredecian> thats him
[5:22:30] <custoadian> lil' baby hollow knight
[5:22:34] <corepool> yup
[5:22:34] <%AbnormalVoid> Yeah
[5:22:34] <fillamar> hollow knight
[5:22:35] <deviljhojho94> yeah
[5:22:35] <ooblagis> is your bro
[5:22:35] <Eresus> yes
[5:22:35] <%TheImmortal70> Yes
[5:22:36] <zal_silverfang> yes
[5:22:36] <SatansDick1> that is the hollow knight in the egg
[5:22:36] <+Corvax__> yee
[5:22:37] <+TeethMuncher> @Saturdaythe14th to be fair, woolie went in blind and will probably pick it back up
[5:22:37] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Yes
[5:22:38] <$magikestral> @angriestpat the idea is that the Hollow Knight is emotionless to accomplish its task. Unfortunately, it seems that the king formed a bond with the vessel he chose, leading to it's downfall and corruption.
[5:22:38] <%NobleJedi> yup
[5:22:38] <$Mendin> ANIKIIIIIII
[5:22:41] <Pairoschuz> The hollow knight is your brother
[5:22:41] <zal_silverfang> well, no
[5:22:41] <element_of_loyalty> ues
[5:22:44] <+Camail> LETS GO
[5:22:45] <%skizzuto> yes
[5:22:45] <hntronium> MASAKA
[5:22:46] <Fruitywhompus> Him looking back implies that he never was a perfect vessel tbh
[5:22:47] <%Dimfish> as a kid yes
[5:22:47] <EMP_Ike_Turner> BRRROTHER
[5:22:47] <dandyspider> that's the hollow knight before
[5:22:52] <RedMaskBandit> Oni chan
[5:22:52] <deviljhojho94> VOID
[5:22:53] <fillamar> not you
[5:22:54] <%TheImmortal70> ITS TIME
[5:22:55] <+th3madness> VOID HEART BOI
[5:22:55] <%AbnormalVoid> it me
[5:22:55] <Stupidittty> That was indeed the hollow night. But not the one you think.
[5:22:55] <Pairoschuz> lil baby hollow knight
[5:22:56] <zal_silverfang> HE was the failure. YOU were the Hollow Night
[5:22:56] <wunderkonig> @AngriestPat Congrats, you have gone hollow. and yeah your brother the hollow knight let you drop to the bottom of an abyss when you tried to crawl your way back up.
[5:22:57] <%DedlokPM> BAKANA
[5:22:59] <ShawnEXE> OH BABY
[5:22:59] <Tampaoster> ARTERIAS TIME
[5:23:02] <+Robo_Wizard1> Pat you have to mock the hell out of Woolie for not doing this stuff and thinking he was done
[5:23:03] <+Templar15> tadaaaaa
[5:23:06] <$Mendin> @AngriestPat Before going to fight the final boss, you should consider getting the last blob of Essence to get Moth Lady's final lore bit
[5:23:06] <dartagnan4012> go back to the temple of the black egg
[5:23:07] <%Tredecian> the plague is in the collective unconscious
[5:23:07] <fillamar> you are a failure
[5:23:08] <%TheImmortal70> CONQUER THE GREAT VOID WITHIN
[5:23:08] <element_of_loyalty> The End
[5:23:09] <+TehBeerBaron> No reflection
[5:23:09] <hntronium> TIME FOR RADIANCE
[5:23:09] <deviljhojho94> This game is soo fucking cool
[5:23:10] <Pairoschuz> KING OF THE VOID
[5:23:14] <+keksisblyat> YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[5:23:14] <+Camail> YUP
[5:23:15] <strangelee> There was only one successful Hollow Knight, and it had a flaw, now piece it together @AngriestPat
[5:23:18] <+G_Thunders> That was the kid the dad liked after path of pain... I think
[5:23:19] <AncelDeLambert> time for the boss fight that made me say "fuck it"
[5:23:22] <%MelBrooksKA> I don't get it, but then again I've barely been here and barely paid attention
[5:23:23] <ukokira> He doesn't really need the lore bit
[5:23:27] <$magikestral> it is no longer a charm.
[5:23:29] <hntronium> FROM TRUE DOCTRINE NEVER WAVER
[5:23:31] <dandyspider> you dream nailed yourself
[5:23:31] <+th3madness> YOU LOCKED IN NOW BUDDY
[5:23:32] <%TheImmortal70> This is you
[5:23:32] <Coystick> The Hollow Knight felt a pang of Sympathy. he was not true HOLLOW
[5:23:33] <OtterSlinger> Hope you didn't want to use it to gain soul
[5:23:33] <ukokira> He already said he's gonna do Godmaster eventually
[5:23:33] <EMP_Ike_Turner> BECOME A PART OF ME
[5:23:34] <WaffleLeech> Void friends
[5:23:35] <%Tredecian> hollow knight round 2
[5:23:35] <+Camail> LETS GOOOO
[5:23:37] <Pairoschuz> takes no charm slots
[5:23:38] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat now it's free rooPog
[5:23:40] <$Kefbar> back to the final boss
[5:23:40] <ukokira> So he's gonna stream after final ending
[5:23:40] <wunderkonig> It doesn't take up a notch it's fine
[5:23:40] <AncelDeLambert> requires no notches
[5:23:43] <Ssoline> !uptime
[5:23:43] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 23m 45s.
[5:23:47] <%skizzuto> you're the master of the void now, if you die your ghost won't attack you anymore
[5:23:47] <Stupidittty> Beat the nightmare king, let's go.
[5:23:47] <@SSaryn> Takes no slots but it does become apart of you forever.
[5:23:48] <+JustToWatch> @AngriestPat go back to where you got the shade dash and nail the statue for lore
[5:23:48] <%OceanGovernor> rooVV welcome to the Void
[5:23:48] <SatansDick1> hollowknight round 2
[5:23:49] <%ArcanumMBD> THE VISION
[5:23:50] <Envy_the_spider> free will?
[5:23:53] <Endocrom> Are you the Guyvver unit!
[5:23:55] <deviljhojho94> Love
[5:23:57] <damienlunas> @AngriestPat this also means you lose the effect of the Kingsoul charm for good, but at least it's not a super great charm.
[5:23:58] <fillamar> You will eventually
[5:23:58] <DivineDragoonKain> What'd you see at the end of the Path of Pain?
[5:23:58] <+th3madness> hollow knight wasn't perfect
[5:23:59] <grayjammer> Think about the end of the Path of Pain
[5:24:01] <custoadian> it'll come together
[5:24:02] <+trekkie11041> hollow knight wasnt quite hollow
[5:24:04] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat It's highly likely that you were in fact the perfect vessel, but they knew nothing about you, and left you there before you eventually escape out into the world
[5:24:04] <0rond> he wasn't truly hollow, which means he couldn't contain, which was it's point
[5:24:06] <$Mendin> It turns out A Daddy's Love was the weakness all along
[5:24:07] <legendarysabertooth> A discarded vessel which was thought inferior to the hollow knight
[5:24:08] <+LtShuckle> the pale king treated the knight as a friend
[5:24:10] <leole11> pale knight and hollow knight formed a bond, which made the hollow knight... not hollow
[5:24:12] <fillamar> Time for true ending
[5:24:12] <%SmolBluGhost> u made a neat contract with the void there bud idk ive never played
[5:24:12] <%ArcanumMBD> The Path of Pain vision. You saw the Hollow Knight and the King. HK loved the king. That flaw fucked everyone over
[5:24:14] <ooblagis> it lived the King
[5:24:16] <%mattmanj17> @AngriestPat the cut scene in pop shows that the hollow knight thoght of pale king as father. that was why he was not perefect hollow
[5:24:16] <bliksnort> It was successfully made, but unsuccessfully raised. The king raised it as a son.
[5:24:16] <AncelDeLambert> UNIFIES THE VOID
[5:24:18] <ukokira> This charm means you aren't completley hollow either
[5:24:19] <thisisacoolguy> As matt would say "I love my daddy"
[5:24:20] <ooblagis> loved
[5:24:21] <+Littledax> hollow knight was perfect, but the pale king loved him like a son and the hollow knight shared that bond and became corruptable by the radiance
[5:24:21] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat It's likely that the other one was also perfect, but became tainted by sentience at some point
[5:24:22] <deviljhojho94> Time to kill this shit
[5:24:23] <%Dimfish> hollow knightbwas your big bro, but he failed. you climbed up behind him but were too late
[5:24:24] <ukokira> "Under the users will"
[5:24:25] <zal_silverfang> someone tell him
[5:24:26] <%AbnormalVoid> The Light takes over minds, the hollow knight was supposed to be mindless
[5:24:27] <custoadian> it'll make more sense once he gets to the final ending
[5:24:27] <+discodemolition> The actual hollow knight looked back- which means it wasn’t truly hollow
[5:24:28] <rathma301> the hollow knight was raised with love and affection thus ruining him as the vessel with no emotions
[5:24:29] <+QuadraticGravity> pat no
[5:24:30] <ukokira> Your character has a will
[5:24:30] <$Kefbar> @angriestpat go to the boss and you will understand
[5:24:31] <wunderkonig> those no longer attack you
[5:24:32] <SatansDick1> round 2 or nkg
[5:24:33] <Coystick> YOU ARE PERFECT ORGANISM
[5:24:33] <Endocrom> They aren't attacking you
[5:24:33] <bloodypurpledog> HK's gotta take a shit somehow think about it
[5:24:34] <%TheImmortal70> Yeah
[5:24:35] <DivineDragoonKain> All void creatures are friendly now
[5:24:35] <uninformedpotato> The hollow knight was not pure enough, because it has attachment feeling with the king
[5:24:36] <blockedL> LUL
[5:24:36] <+th3madness> yeah
[5:24:36] <%mattmanj17> NO
[5:24:36] <+TeethMuncher> yes

[5:24:39] <leole11> no
[5:24:39] <SatansDick1> ye
[5:24:40] <grayjammer> No
[5:24:40] <wunderkonig> no
[5:24:41] <$magikestral> @angriestpat there is a nursery in the white palace. it is implied the king formed a bond with the hollow knight which led to its downfall.
[5:24:41] <+Cervarian> Yes
[5:24:41] <@SSaryn> No.
[5:24:41] <ShawnEXE> NO
[5:24:41] <%mattmanj17> hornet

[5:24:51] <Abyssal_Jaguar> @AngriestPat CLIMB OUT
[5:24:51] <%redsonyou> No climb up
[5:24:51] <DonatelloJose> Not yet
[5:24:52] <dandyspider> walk up to the shades
[5:24:52] <ukokira> Which means since your character literally has a will according to this charm, he's not hollow
[5:24:52] <i_do_yur_mom_yung_midorya> no
[5:24:53] <DuskPixie> NO
[5:24:53] <leole11> because there's a thing at the thing

[5:24:59] <@SSaryn> Take it from Strident if anything.
[5:25:00] <DivineDragoonKain> and when you die you get your shade in one hit
[5:25:00] <ooblagis> talk to them
[5:25:03] <RedMaskBandit> Notice they arent hostile
[5:25:04] <Blu_C> Pat murders all.
[5:25:06] <ape_hawk> QUICK! SOMEONE CALL VV
[5:25:07] <%TheImmortal70> Yeah no don't teleport
[5:25:09] <%skizzuto> i don't think it will let him if he tried anyway
[5:25:09] <+Robo_Wizard1> why are you being so mean to the friendly shades
[5:25:09] <cintra212> Plus Hornet
[5:25:09] <+Camail> zal_silverfang people want to see him realize the shades aren't hostile
[5:25:11] <0rond> stop killing the voidlings
[5:25:12] <%TheImmortal70> There is one more thing
[5:25:12] <+QuadraticGravity> pat killing the entire village
[5:25:12] <ukokira> Also jesus christ why is this chat exploiding
[5:25:19] <+conradical> @AngriestPat the Hollow Knight isn't truly "hollow" and as such is corruptable like everything else. the player's Knight is truly hollow
[5:25:20] <EMP_Ike_Turner> I AM THOU THOU ART I
[5:25:20] <Borealum_EX> @AngriestPat dialogue at the top
[5:25:21] <dandyspider> don't attack shades
[5:25:21] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat You've unified them
[5:25:22] <%Sirculbs> Shades are jon hostile
[5:25:22] <Fruitywhompus> theyre your brothers !
[5:25:23] <aeonicvector> Your one of them
[5:25:23] <%brave_sj> You're too cool
[5:25:23] <hellfirejefe> same goes for your shade
[5:25:24] <leole11> VOID HEART
[5:25:24] <Pairoschuz> you're their leader
[5:25:25] <$magikestral> you are now the void.
[5:25:26] <+Robo_Wizard1> it's almost as if the thing the new item says
[5:25:27] <$Mendin> You have been recognised as One of Them with the Heart of Void
[5:25:28] <%skizzuto> you're their master now
[5:25:28] <+Corvax__> you are one with the void
[5:25:29] <zal_silverfang> @Camail ahh now i see. thank you
[5:25:29] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat you're the black goo now
[5:25:30] <DivineDragoonKain> This includes your death shade
[5:25:30] <AncelDeLambert> UNIFIED
[5:25:31] <epylepticpanda> U ARE THE BLACK EVIL
[5:25:32] <+jyrecko> UNIFIED VOID
[5:25:33] <Fruitywhompus> friend
[5:25:34] <$rdark_ksu> thats the thingy
[5:25:35] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat YOU ARE THE VOID rooKek
[5:25:35] <Stupidittty> Damn, chat is like a spoiled little baby that didn't get their candy sometimes.
[5:25:36] <blockedL> YOU UNIFY THE VOID
[5:25:37] <+TeethMuncher> Pat = biocurse
[5:25:41] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat the King was a good dad to Hollow Knight. HK got attached to the king. That attachment meant he was a flawed vessel and is why the infection wasn't contained
[5:25:43] <dandyspider> you are a pure vessel now
[5:25:43] <johnny2by4x6> Your brothers and Sisters
[5:25:43] <wunderkonig> Pat has become the black evil
[5:25:45] <ukokira> @conradical Voidsoul confirms you aren't hollow since you have a will
[5:25:48] <Tampaoster> YOU ARE MANUS NOW
[5:25:50] <Saturdaythe14th> "damn, chat exploding because the streamer asked a question and could have missed something"
[5:25:51] <legendarysabertooth> You are essentially the void now
[5:25:55] <%Sirculbs> @angriestpat Void Heart. Shades aren't atking u. Think bout it.
[5:25:56] <RedMaskBandit> It includes your blob
[5:25:57] <Saturdaythe14th> You people sometimes, god damn
[5:25:59] <%SmolBluGhost> Sasuke why
[5:26:01] <ukokira> Basically the kings plan never really has a confirmed success
[5:26:02] <+TeethMuncher> Pretty much
[5:26:06] <$magikestral> hollow knight wasn't so hollow
[5:26:07] <Blu_C> Pretty much.
[5:26:12] <ukokira> The Hollow Knight wasn't hollow
[5:26:12] <%skizzuto> yeah pretty much
[5:26:16] <aeonicvector> YUP
[5:26:16] <ShawnEXE> NO WILL
[5:26:17] <+QuadraticGravity> he got it :D
[5:26:19] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Alright so lore guide: You've gone from being the perfect vessel to contain the thing to an unbridled void creature ready to fuck some shit up
[5:26:20] <ShawnEXE> NO MIND
[5:26:21] <dandyspider> you have to be void of all
[5:26:22] <+Corvax__> you pretty much got it
[5:26:26] <%mister___doctor> I WUNNA SEE PAT REEACT TOO *DIS* PART OF DA GAME
[5:26:26] <ukokira> And neither was the main character
[5:26:28] <$Mendin> A mind controlling parasite? Uroboros?
[5:26:33] <Veluren> They raised him like the child they couldn't have, so it gave him a will and a heart
[5:26:33] <+TeethMuncher> This is why you don't give machines sapience
[5:26:34] <Zanicedg> The Hollow Knight accidentally gained pride.
[5:26:35] <damienlunas> You can't get mind controlled if you don't have a mind. *Taps head*
[5:26:42] <AncelDeLambert> has he gotten black scream?
[5:26:43] <ooblagis> Hollow Knight loved the King, which the Radiance latched onto
[5:26:44] <+th3madness> hollow knight liked the king, implied to feel something for the failed vessels by the way it looked back at you
[5:26:46] <thisisacoolguy> Funny thing is the void isn't mindless at all ever. Your knight proves that by doing sidequests and being nice to everyone
[5:26:46] <+Camail> now comes probably my favorite sequence form any game i've ever played
[5:26:47] <aeonicvector> Hollow Knight is a spinoff of Resi5 CONFIRMED
[5:26:50] <wunderkonig> You have become that which has no soul, a emer
[5:26:52] <+timblenaut> @mendin total hollownest saturation
[5:26:52] <wunderkonig> memer*
[5:26:52] <%DedlokPM> @Mendin The Black Evil! z8z3
[5:26:53] <ShawnEXE> Oh what?
[5:26:54] <0rond> the point of the hollow knight originally was not to fight it,it was to contain it within itself, but because he wasn't 100% hollow, it started to leak out
[5:26:54] <%TheImmortal70> Nothing?
[5:26:56] <+th3madness> because they're stupid
[5:26:56] <CryptCreep> metroid vibes
[5:26:59] <blockedL> Jebaited
[5:27:01] <+DakotaChip> Did he complete path of pain? What did I miss since then?
[5:27:02] <element_of_loyalty> Stupid I guess
[5:27:04] <WaffleLeech> Builds character
[5:27:04] <+th3madness> hornet is not up here
[5:27:05] <%TheImmortal70> LUL
[5:27:06] <$magikestral> people were thinking of the first time wirh hornet i guess
[5:27:08] <$Mendin> The thing people were thinking would happen was from the first visit
[5:27:09] <%AbnormalVoid> Jebaited
[5:27:09] <wunderkonig> now Dab the final boss to death
[5:27:10] <kimo313> What is it about Pat streams that are so comfy?
[5:27:10] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat you needed to see
[5:27:10] <+Camail> AngriestPat it was to make you see that the shades weren't hostile
[5:27:11] <strangelee> They wanted you to Dream the Bowl Bug Thing
[5:27:12] <leole11> i thought there was a thing
[5:27:15] <fillamar> Hollow knight fight again
[5:27:16] <Jontman42> Get fucked chat
[5:27:16] <Saturdaythe14th> I only saw hornet when I went there
[5:27:19] <Kain5707> wheres hornet?
[5:27:20] <aeonicvector> make sure you noticed the dark spirits, and people followed the pattern
[5:27:20] <%TheImmortal70> I think it's another one of those sequence break thing
[5:27:22] <grayjammer> Oh, the hornet dialogue was from earlier... silly me!!!!!
[5:27:23] <scrumdrew> you can teleport
[5:27:23] <Tampaoster> AY AY AY AY
[5:27:25] <zal_silverfang> @DakotaChip he beat it. was clutch. went to abyss to learn the lore
[5:27:25] <+Corvax__> probably just wanted you to see the void things not attack you
[5:27:26] <%mister___doctor> jesus fuck, Chat. just let him teleport. He didnt "need to see" anything
[5:27:26] <%Dimfish> hornet would have been up there, but you got her dialog earlier so shes gone
[5:27:27] <$magikestral> hornet is only on first visir
[5:27:31] <+th3madness> hornet happens the first time
[5:27:33] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Fun fact: based on comments on a previous podcast pretty sure Woolie never fought the true final boss for ending 3 which is why he thinks the final boss is easy
[5:27:33] <+conradical> isn't Hornet there when you get the shade cloak?
[5:27:34] <scrumdrew> hornet was there on the first visit
[5:27:34] <+DakotaChip> My phone overheated cause I left it on a stove burner and it died.
[5:27:35] <SatansDick1> hornet is only there the first time idiots
[5:27:38] <asbestosflavored> he needed to see his power over the void
[5:27:43] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> The Hollow Knight has a lot of dreamnail dialogue that was cut from the game, almost all of it is from the parasite, but the very last bit is just a single line that says "...father....?"
[5:27:43] <+ShikiHisashi> Oily abs
[5:27:49] <fireking900> it better not be the whole, " It was you, the player who was the parasite all along!" type shit
[5:27:50] <$magikestral> @arcanummbd he outright admitted to not getting the true ending
[5:27:57] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Aight, with that you're ready for the two main game endings.
[5:27:57] <%redsonyou> true ending
[5:28:03] <dartagnan4012> time to fight hollow knight again
[5:28:05] <fillamar> true end now
[5:28:05] <Endocrom> Is the grub Dad any different?
[5:28:05] <wunderkonig> Grimchild is good for this.
[5:28:09] <+velemi> @fireking900 don't worry, it's much better
[5:28:14] <TomerTop> @Sirculbs @QuadraticGravity sorry, he asked if "he was his son", probably wrong to asnwer that
[5:28:21] <%Dimfish> whatever build you think is best
[5:28:21] <$magikestral> true ending time, this is gonna be good
[5:28:21] <ukokira> I see Pat is loading up for the wrong boss fight
[5:28:24] <Tampaoster> GRIMCHILD BEST CHILD
[5:28:25] <thisisacoolguy> Hollow knight is a good boy who wants to make people happy. Same with the player knight. They're good boys
[5:28:26] <+Camail> mods get ready for spoilers?
[5:28:28] <+conradical> don't use Elegy, you're hardly going to be at full during the fight
[5:28:30] <zal_silverfang> go full over charm
[5:28:31] <Tisaric> oh fuck am I in time for true ending
[5:28:32] <ShawnEXE> Because the hollow knight was chosen as the "perfect" child, he felt pride and loved the king. It is pretty ironic @AngriestPat
[5:28:32] <rathma301> cute git gud incoming
[5:28:36] <%mister___doctor> So when you use the dream gate are you teleporting or are you moving really fast
[5:28:37] <+TeethMuncher> @Endocrom he's just a dude that needed to be fed
[5:28:39] <fillamar> YEAH OVERCHARM ON TRUE END
[5:28:43] <$magikestral> elegy only works on full health
[5:28:46] <arfsm95> what happens if you get overcharmed?
[5:28:51] <$Mendin> Double Damage
[5:28:53] <ooblagis> this boss is easy, he'll be fine
[5:28:54] <wunderkonig> grubsong huh, not very good for bosses but his choice.
[5:28:54] <%TheImmortal70> Doubled damage
[5:28:54] <rathma301> take double damage
[5:28:55] <aeonicvector> @arfsm95 2x damage
[5:28:56] <@SSaryn> Overcharmed is double damage.
[5:28:56] <Tisaric> Oh shit did he just beat White Palace?
[5:28:57] <dandyspider> go talk to the white lady
[5:28:59] <%Dimfish> double damage
[5:29:01] <%TheImmortal70> Quick nail
[5:29:02] <arfsm95> oh i seem thx guys
[5:29:05] <@thenefftw> Just don't get hit
[5:29:10] <fillamar> No, it felt sorry for its siblings and like the pale king was daddy
[5:29:10] <+QuadraticGravity> 4Head
[5:29:10] <AtlasMcCoy> Kappa
[5:29:12] <Borealum_EX> kinky
[5:29:14] <$Mendin> power, length, and recovery time
[5:29:14] <+discodemolition> Or regret
[5:29:15] <GMAN_SECTOR> hey hows it going Pat and chat?
[5:29:16] <tremerss> Hey pat did you know this was made by 2 dudes, and a third person did the music
[5:29:16] <ooblagis> just equip a blue health charm
[5:29:16] <%ArcanumMBD> That's what she said
[5:29:17] <Prism_Wing> heh
[5:29:19] <damienlunas> Pat adds to the length
[5:29:19] <Pairoschuz> But you, you're the perfect vessel because no one loves you and you're not important FeelsBadMan
[5:29:20] <$SGrim> Nice rooLewd
[5:29:28] <arfsm95> just put all the charms and don't get hit at all Kappa
[5:29:30] <+DontMindMee> did he do the non-true ending yet? Just hopped in
[5:29:30] <+TeethMuncher> Power, length, perfect healing...a weapon to surpass metal gear
[5:29:30] <ukokira> Two hits of damage becomes four hits of damage
[5:29:30] <wunderkonig> @Pairoschuz and you don't care.
[5:29:36] <0rond> the charm that makes you not get pushed back when you attack is amazing
[5:29:40] <%TheImmortal70> Big damage
[5:29:41] <%mister___doctor> Power, length, and quick healing really gets the ladies going
[5:29:42] <+DakotaChip> lobosGasm give me more length daddy
[5:29:45] <$Mendin> Invincibility, Eternal Life, STANDO POWAA
[5:29:49] <thisisacoolguy> You do care. The void constructs like the player character have emotions- just no voice
[5:29:50] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat ZOTE!
[5:29:51] <legendarysabertooth> No cost too great
[5:29:57] <fillamar> No, this is good now
[5:29:59] <LtThunderbolt> whens smite
[5:30:02] <$magikestral> nah, true final boss is most important now
[5:30:02] <grayjammer> Its almost like The Hollow Knight is an ambiguous character, huh?
[5:30:05] <element_of_loyalty> Agree
[5:30:09] <%Kghaleon> Epic stuff awaits.
[5:30:09] <@SSaryn> Man I don't blame you.
[5:30:09] <EMP_Ike_Turner> ay gurl ay
[5:30:10] <Tisaric> BEST ENDING TIME
[5:30:11] <wunderkonig> I thought the entire point was that they were hollow and had no mind.
[5:30:21] <%TheImmortal70> That's the irony
[5:30:24] <+Camail> yea ignore the dlc, its really just designed for people who did everything else
[5:30:25] <ShawnEXE> here we go
[5:30:26] <Stupidittty> Wha happen, though?

[5:30:30] <%riantDeliration> beat the shit out of him
[5:30:30] <ooblagis> Upon learning of his past, various dialogue states The Knight is no longer the perfect vessel. He found purpose and self.

[5:30:53] <Donchalant402> dont dreamnail
[5:30:56] <IHATREID> GIT GUD
[5:31:00] <%skizzuto> GIT GUD
[5:31:02] <Ombrebird> shit i went away for 1.5 hours and pat is still playing???!!!
[5:31:07] <TomerTop> did pat already do the challenge fo fools?
[5:31:10] <grimporio> get ready chat
[5:31:12] <+th3madness> shhhhhh
[5:31:18] <+Camail> its a breach
[5:31:19] <+th3madness> it's leaking out
[5:31:19] <fillamar> Just wait, pat
[5:31:20] <Zanicedg> You'll see.
[5:31:20] <$magikestral> you'll see
[5:31:20] <+Templar15> MAAAAAGIIIIIIC
[5:31:21] <custoadian> just wait
[5:31:21] <%Minorou> bug magic
[5:31:21] <Tisaric> but for real timing the dreamnail perfectly here is so fucking satisfying
[5:31:22] <AtlasMcCoy> @AngriestPat He didnt do the BEST of jobs
[5:31:22] <%skizzuto> you'll see
[5:31:22] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat You'll figure it out
[5:31:22] <TomerTop> they're not containing the infection
[5:31:23] <rathma301> he is failing to contain it
[5:31:23] <Calek> don't worry about it
[5:31:23] <leole11> it WASN'T contained
[5:31:23] <$Mendin> The containment failed obv
[5:31:23] <OhioNitsud> he's about to beat the game?
[5:31:24] <Coystick> He only has one arm.
[5:31:24] <Jaghatai> The vessel was imperfect
[5:31:24] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat the infection is metaphysical
[5:31:24] <+QuadraticGravity> you'll see
[5:31:27] <%ArcanumMBD> THIS ISNT THE INFECTION'S FINAL FORM
[5:31:29] <damienlunas> just jam it back in
[5:31:29] <%jK00215> platyGUD platyGUD platyGUD
[5:31:29] <%Kghaleon> Hollow knight weakended, so it didn't work
[5:31:30] <zal_silverfang> it broke free later cause he was imperfect
[5:31:30] <%Dimfish> it wasnt always out there
[5:31:31] <ooblagis> MAGIC
[5:31:32] <+discodemolition> Wait so what happened that makes pat not want to come back to the game
[5:31:35] <0rond> it originiated from here, because the hollow knight that contained it failed
[5:31:35] <IHATREID> it leaked out because you killed the dreamers doofus
[5:31:36] <wunderkonig> @AngriestPat It's a biocurse.
[5:31:36] <dandyspider> it's a vey weak version
[5:31:37] <+th3madness> HE TRIED HIS BEST
[5:31:40] <$rdark_ksu> its the statue
[5:31:45] <%MelBrooksKA> "I lived bitch"
[5:31:46] <+TeethMuncher> "I'm you, but better"
[5:31:48] <+psycosis> i would watch this, but I'm also at the end of this game
[5:31:51] <+conradical> @AngriestPat the Hollow Knight was supposed to contain the entire infection, but since he was flawed, the infection was able to leak out which led to the destruction of Hollownest
[5:32:00] <Goergorion> where is Hornet?
[5:32:02] <ukokira> The infection was already leaking out
[5:32:10] <epylepticpanda> This is just the source of it. thats why its important to seal
[5:32:10] <$Mendin> he was not the pure vessel the king hoped for
[5:32:13] <arfsm95> this game would be 5 times easier with a parry option
[5:32:13] <%Agami23> protag knight really needs some nergigante armor to get earplugs
[5:32:14] <element_of_loyalty> what a spaz
[5:32:15] <%ArcanumMBD> Fun fact: When HK is stabbing himself every attack or spell deals 1 damage
[5:32:16] <0rond> use abyss shriek it deals tons of damage
[5:32:17] <+Camail> DO NOTHING
[5:32:17] <%bazeljuice> GET GOOD!!
[5:32:19] <AtlasMcCoy> SHE HERE
[5:32:19] <ukokira> You can find many infected enemies and characters before even finding a dreamer
[5:32:19] <%mattmanj17> @AngriestPat GIT GUD!!!!!!
[5:32:19] <grimporio> GIT GUD
[5:32:20] <$Mendin> GET GOOD

[5:32:36] <+th3madness> rip hornet
[5:32:39] <%ArcanumMBD> EAT THE GOO
[5:32:39] <BakerBrute> BAD END
[5:32:41] <$magikestral> he did that last time
[5:32:42] <+Camail> do it
[5:32:42] <aeonicvector> This is BAD END, and YE!!!!
[5:32:42] <mothdude> They always had that attack.
[5:32:43] <Goergorion> ending two
[5:32:43] <SatansDick1> he wanted to get the bad end
[5:32:43] <+th3madness> suck up the juice
[5:32:44] <zal_silverfang> Dead Hornet
[5:32:45] <$SGrim> HORNET TURBO DEAD rooKek
[5:32:45] <$Mendin> Drink that biocurse
[5:32:46] <%Kghaleon> Hornet death ending.
[5:32:46] <hntronium> Fucked up
[5:32:47] <+G_Thunders> not even on purpose
[5:32:49] <leole11> THE GOO
[5:32:49] <@SSaryn> Good job killing everyone, monster Kappa
[5:32:51] <%HiroTSK5> He had a second phase before, you just killed him to fast the first time
[5:32:52] <AtlasMcCoy> BibleThump
[5:32:52] <%Divryne> TAKE IN THE PLAGUE.
[5:32:52] <element_of_loyalty> :D
[5:32:52] <wunderkonig> slurp that sunny D
[5:32:54] <+ShikiHisashi> I thought the same thing honestly
[5:32:54] <%NobleJedi> Bad End
[5:32:56] <epylepticpanda> SUCC THE JUICE
[5:32:57] <+th3madness> well no this is good
[5:32:59] <+Camail> Worst End
[5:33:03] <+th3madness> because no one can break this seal
[5:33:03] <legendarysabertooth> I cost too great
[5:33:04] <EMP_Ike_Turner> BIG SUCC
[5:33:05] <deviljhojho94> bad
[5:33:06] <Donchalant402> BAD END
[5:33:06] <+TeethMuncher> Bad End
[5:33:07] <ShawnEXE> This is definitely the worst ending
[5:33:07] <%OceanGovernor> 4Head good job
[5:33:08] <TheAmazingClaytor> Oh no did he meet Chara?
[5:33:09] <0rond> see, you are truly hollow, so you will actually be able to contain the infection
[5:33:10] <$magikestral> and rhe cycle continues. With a twist!
[5:33:10] <element_of_loyalty> Oopes
[5:33:10] <Tisaric> HORNET DIDN'T HAVE TO DIE
[5:33:11] <%TheImmortal70> THE COST CAN BE GREATER
[5:33:12] <hntronium> B
[5:33:15] <LtThunderbolt> welp thats that
[5:33:15] <%Divryne> Worst end.
[5:33:15] <mothdude> Get duuune!
[5:33:17] <$SGrim> Kill them all, Peter rooKek
[5:33:17] <+yet_another_brony> no shit he just said hes getting bad end on purpose
[5:33:18] <aeonicvector> @th3madness this is legit a worse end then base imop
[5:33:18] <wunderkonig> yeah but he's trully hollow so he can contain it.
[5:33:19] <TomerTop> @conradical i'm pretty sure he wasn't supposed to contain the infection but to kill god. the king was too afraid of fighting god by himself so he picked him, but was mistaken in his pick as he was touched by the sentient of god, which made him able to be mind controlled by him
[5:33:19] <+th3madness> she's just sleeping
[5:33:24] <+LtShuckle> hornet died for nothing
[5:33:25] <%Divryne> Now YOU are the Hollow Knight.
[5:33:25] <+th3madness> it's fiiiiiine
[5:33:25] <ShawnEXE> There's one difference
[5:33:26] <custoadian> Hornet following her mom's footsteps
[5:33:27] <+Sigmacak3> ISAAC
[5:33:29] <asbestosflavored> literally just sleeping
[5:33:29] <element_of_loyalty> BLAND ENDING
[5:33:30] <dandyspider> 2 vessels
[5:33:31] <Goergorion> @AngriestPat Thats the other ending and not the true ending
[5:33:32] <+th3madness> note the door
[5:33:38] <LtThunderbolt> Bald Ending
[5:33:39] <ukokira> He's clearly not actually Hollow
[5:33:40] <ShawnEXE> Like mother like daughter
[5:33:40] <Tisaric> OHHH
[5:33:40] <Veluren> So to described what happened here, you just locked yourself in and turned Hornet into a Dreamer, you created a "Key behind the lock" scenario that will garuntee the next time the infection surfaces, there's no stopping it.
[5:33:41] <$magikestral> like mother like daughter
[5:33:42] <%TheImmortal70> And hornet's face is on there as the dreamer
[5:33:42] <Tisaric> HOLY SHIT
[5:33:44] <%DavidSanChan> binding of isaac endings
[5:33:45] <epylepticpanda> PAT HAS BECOME THE BLACK EVIL
[5:33:45] <+Templar15> now Hornet is a dreamer
[5:33:46] <@StridentSong> Hornet is now your seal
[5:33:49] <%Dimfish> now shes the new dreamer seal
[5:33:49] <rathma301> hornet is the new dreamer
[5:33:50] <EMP_Ike_Turner> HE IS VIGO YOU ARE LIKE THE BUZZING OF FLIES TO HIM
[5:33:50] <+Camail> now she's your "sleeper"
[5:33:50] <wunderkonig> now hornet is the dreamer, and she's trapped in side with you, so no unlocking that lock.
[5:33:54] <asbestosflavored> sealed from the inside
[5:33:54] <ukokira> Hell he might even be worse at being Hollow than the actual hollow knight
[5:33:54] <AncelDeLambert> same ending, don't know why people say it's different
[5:33:55] <Tisaric> I never did that ending holy shit
[5:33:55] <DivineDragoonKain> Hornet is the seal and she's in there with you
[5:33:57] <%ArcanumMBD> Hornet is your dreamer. I.e. if the infection gets loose then EVERYONE IS FUCKED cause the key is inside the locked door
[5:33:58] <fillamar> Thats it, true ending is different though
[5:33:58] <Maverick2736> DAB ENDING
[5:33:58] <Tampaoster> BIG BLACK BIG EVIL
[5:33:59] <+conradical> @TomerTop no, the HK was supposed to contain it completely and be sealed in the egg
[5:34:00] <$Mendin> At the same time, with the Void Heart, will/would it leak out again?
[5:34:02] <+TeethMuncher> If Hollow Knight has no will, what even motivates it?
[5:34:03] <$magikestral> hornet is now an unwanted dreamer
[5:34:03] <+th3madness> well if hollow knight is prefect
[5:34:03] <LtThunderbolt> Kinda short
[5:34:05] <%Divryne> BIG BAD ENDING.
[5:34:05] <0rond> this is the worst ending
[5:34:06] <ChucklesTheBeard> And because hornet is contained within the sealed egg, the seal will never be broken, and the kingdom will reign eternal.
[5:34:09] <SatansDick1> now for true ending
[5:34:09] <+th3madness> it can't get out
[5:34:11] <element_of_loyalty> Do it again
[5:34:12] <$SGrim> Hornet is just like Paige! Pat's sister rooKek
[5:34:13] <Tisaric> THAT'S THE WORST
[5:34:16] <+Camail> ok real ending now
[5:34:16] <ooblagis> The King beat the Radiance before, but he couldn't kill it. Hence containment.
[5:34:18] <aeonicvector> Its worst end
[5:34:18] <OhioNitsud> dope, well done Pat
[5:34:19] <%Jpdodds> @wunderkonig The Knight isn't hollow, he does in this game that can pretty much only be chalked up to compassion
[5:34:20] <%AbnormalVoid> time for the BEST ending
[5:34:22] <%wizkid50000> Pat, why are you always angry?
[5:34:25] <IHATREID> alright lads how long will it take pat to beat the radiance
[5:34:26] <+greenfall> cant skip, relax before the true end
[5:34:27] <+QuadraticGravity> @ooblagis spoooooooooooooileeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer
[5:34:27] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat As they say, The cost can ALWAYS be greater Kappa
[5:34:28] <tremerss> credits for the 5 people on the team
[5:34:29] <$magikestral> cannot skip the endinf
[5:34:29] <grayjammer> Cant skip the credits
[5:34:29] <Coystick> Mushroom ending WHEN?
[5:34:31] <@SSaryn> apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink
[5:34:31] <Zanicedg> Unskippable credits are unskippable.
[5:34:31] <Tisaric> oh my god that's so much worse than A
[5:34:32] <%SmolBluGhost> that was p rad
[5:34:34] <%AbnormalVoid> apatWink
[5:34:34] <%ArcanumMBD> @ChucklesTheBeard except if the infection leaks out again, then everyone is fucked cause the key is inside the locked room
[5:34:34] <%spacekataz18> Elmowwww
[5:34:35] <WaffleLeech> Well the player character is a perfect vessel, so it's not so bad.
[5:34:36] <blockedL> alt f4
[5:34:36] <$magikestral> its 5 people, Pat
[5:34:38] <wunderkonig> @Jpdodds I just marked that up to game contrivance
[5:34:38] <strangelee> I don't consider it the Bad End though, you are the perfect Vessal after all
[5:34:38] <+th3madness> I'm excited for this shit
[5:34:38] <ukokira> Honestly resealing it makes no sense
[5:34:38] <%skizzuto> apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink
[5:34:41] <$Mendin> Time for the best Boss Intro
[5:34:44] <CryptCreep> elmo cam?
[5:34:44] <%MelBrooksKA> apatElmo apatElmo
[5:34:44] <%Piemen99> WELL THAT WAS COOL
[5:34:44] <PumaOfDarkness> Then back to Octopath for me~
[5:34:45] <%NobleJedi> so you gonna get the good ending now?
[5:34:45] <ukokira> Other characters are already infected
[5:34:45] <SatansDick1> when is mushroom ending
[5:34:47] <element_of_loyalty> WHAT DUMB ASS GAME DOES NOT ALLOW SKIP
[5:34:54] <%thunderborn32> wait what about the black charm?
[5:34:55] <%Kghaleon> Even if you don't do Godmaster, you should at least look at the DLC area sometime. It's pretty cool.
[5:34:55] <%Piemen99> DOPE EVEN
[5:34:56] <AncelDeLambert> Devs, do not do this
[5:34:56] <ukokira> So it'd just leak back out from the other characters
[5:34:58] <ChucklesTheBeard> @ArcanumMBD The infection only leaked out in-game because the seals were broken, right?
[5:34:58] <legendarysabertooth> Reset
[5:35:00] <$Mendin> Friskk?
[5:35:01] <fireking900> no skip 0/10
[5:35:03] <$Mendin> Stay Determined
[5:35:03] <%SmolBluGhost> apatWink apatPorgmo apatWink apatPorgmo Fluffy baby
[5:35:04] <ooblagis> @quadraticgravity we literally just saw the end of the game
[5:35:04] <aeonicvector> @ChucklesTheBeard the big thing is you ALSO may not be a perfect vessel, ergo you ALSO break, only this time no one can save the day
[5:35:06] <leole11> mushroom ending is too good for this world
[5:35:07] <+th3madness> pat
[5:35:09] <ekkieekk> did pat actually do path of pain?
[5:35:10] <+th3madness> JUST WAIT
[5:35:11] <DonatelloJose> Because these people worked hard to make this game.
[5:35:11] <blockedL> dont do this, only villains do this
[5:35:12] <Tisaric> you'll see
[5:35:15] <custoadian> it'll make sense
[5:35:15] <Blu_C> You'll find out in the next ending.
[5:35:15] <Tampaoster> YUP
[5:35:16] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat the infection is metaphysical
[5:35:18] <strangelee> You'll see on True Ending Pat
[5:35:19] <$magikestral> you will see when you get the true ending
[5:35:19] <Eresus> because the vessel failled
[5:35:20] <+th3madness> FINISH THE GAME THEN YOU'LL SEE
[5:35:21] <Daniel_Is_I> You'll see.
[5:35:21] <AtlasMcCoy> Yea the hollow knight wasnt good at his job, but you are.
[5:35:22] <fillamar> Because it leaks out of the hollow knight
[5:35:23] <SatansDick1> youll see in the true end
[5:35:26] <leole11> that's because the containment failed
[5:35:27] <8BitDsx> @ekkieekk Yeyeye
[5:35:28] <wunderkonig> @AngriestPat It's a biocurse pat,
[5:35:30] <+TootPirate> that's why the succ happened
[5:35:31] <0rond> the infection starts from the temple of the black egg
[5:35:32] <+Roundelay11> becuase the current hollow knight is an imperfect seal
[5:35:32] <DonatelloJose> Mantis Lords are RAD.
[5:35:33] <ukokira> Like there's literally an entire tribe dedicated to being infected for POWERER
[5:35:34] <%ArcanumMBD> @ChucklesTheBeard nope. It leaked out cause HK was a flawed vessel. And there's no guarantee you are a perfect vessel. Especially with the attachments you gained through the game
[5:35:35] <dandyspider> it's not a normal "infection"
[5:35:35] <pectusumbra> I assume when you do the focus and suck all the pink gas into you your taking it from everyone
[5:35:36] <epylepticpanda> THE HOLLOW KNIGHT ABSORBED THE SOURCE
[5:35:36] <$Mendin> This is why I said Pat should get the final Moth Lore
[5:35:39] <fillamar> yeah, it turns physical eventually
[5:35:39] <mothdude> Physical orange goo
[5:35:40] <$magikestral> y'all do not spoil
[5:35:40] <KatabolicRage> hey I just got here, which one he get?
[5:35:41] <Tisaric> I mean....
[5:35:44] <%Divryne> Well you would know if you got the true ending. LUL
[5:35:45] <fillamar> pretty much a biocurse
[5:35:45] <ooblagis> The infection IS the good, it's will made manifest.
[5:35:45] <+Neryl_> Just got told in Discord that you beat it. Congrats @AngriestPat !
[5:35:46] <%Tredecian> its manifest physcally from the dream
[5:35:46] <Diego_Umejuarez> OH FUCK IT REALLY IS A BIOCURSE
[5:35:46] <+discodemolition> Because the hollow knight failed
[5:35:46] <ukokira> So it's gonna leak from them
[5:35:46] <fillamar> no joke
[5:35:47] <+yet_another_brony> it wouldnt be out there if the hollow knight was perfect
[5:35:48] <%Press_X_ToJASON> the ultimate bioweapon
[5:35:48] <aeonicvector> in THIS case it ACTUALLY is
[5:35:48] <SatansDick1> true end will reveal all
[5:35:48] <Tampaoster> BIG BIO BIG CURSE
[5:35:48] <$magikestral> @katabolicrage ending B
[5:35:49] <Hydrapissed> I guess u can resist it
[5:35:51] <+velemi> It's always a biocurse
[5:35:52] <SwindlerOfProgress> It's both. You'll see.
[5:35:52] <asbestosflavored> it infects their dreams
[5:35:52] <rhus> The infection really is a biocurse.
[5:35:53] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat also, there are those that can resist it like the manti and bees
[5:35:54] <Hydrapissed> hunter resist it the mantis resist it
[5:35:55] <ShawnEXE> THE END WILL REVEAL ALL
[5:35:55] <grayjammer> You'll see
[5:35:56] <ThetaFive> Jeez it really IS a biocurse
[5:35:58] <hellfirejefe> as soon as hollow knight started leaking everyone could catch it
[5:35:58] <%TheImmortal70> The goo is goo
[5:35:59] <$Mendin> The final Moth Lore explains the biocurse more clearly.
[5:35:59] <+th3madness> the actual thing getting sealed is a lot worse than some goo tumors
[5:35:59] <AncelDeLambert> Well, your dream nail is pretty physical when you swing it around
[5:36:00] <dandyspider> the vanilla true ending will reveal all
[5:36:01] <LokimenD> It's literally a biocurse
[5:36:01] <ryu1299> biocurse goes away everything become normal
[5:36:01] <%SmolBluGhost> get me some of that bioCURSE
[5:36:04] <+QuadraticGravity> your chat sucks at not spoiling things pat
[5:36:05] <%lutefiiisk> how many %
[5:36:05] <BourneWarrior> BIG BIOCURSE
[5:36:05] <Nishi74> Which ending did he get I just got here
[5:36:06] <Tampaoster> BIG BLACK BIO CURSED EVIL
[5:36:10] <+NovaTera> what a mansion!
[5:36:13] <aeonicvector> The real hollowknight was the biocurse we found along the way
[5:36:13] <%TheImmortal70> The Bees were ALSO infected
[5:36:14] <legendarysabertooth> Let’s appreciate this music though
[5:36:14] <+JustToWatch> The real biocurse was the friends we made along the way
[5:36:15] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Get ready for the title card
[5:36:15] <+conradical> @AngriestPat the infection has been going on for possibly years prior to the start of the game; easily enough time for the infection to kill everyone
[5:36:15] <ValidVenasaur> 3 more endings
[5:36:15] <epylepticpanda> DOES THE HOLLOW KNIGHT TELEPORT OF MOVE REALLY FAST?
[5:36:16] <+Templar15> 2, nishi
[5:36:16] <SchroedingersFerret> It's one of Umbrella's most POWERFUL curses.
[5:36:19] <Stupidittty> That's what you get when you drink too much sunnyD.
[5:36:20] <ukokira> I don't think the dream nail's really physical
[5:36:22] <%mattmanj17> @AngriestPat what is your completion %
[5:36:25] <%Jpdodds> @wunderkonig The Void Heart has the statement "... Unifies the void under the bearer's *will*", if the compassion thing doesn't do it for you, the game tells you
[5:36:28] <hellfirejefe> uhh
[5:36:29] <ukokira> It just looks like it
[5:36:29] <%ArcanumMBD> Let's be real, Pat will probably do a big lore binge after this
[5:36:29] <mothdude> Traitor Lord got pretty goo'd up.
[5:36:31] <dartagnan4012> your not done yet
[5:36:31] <ShawnEXE> well uh

[5:39:30] <$magikestral> this boss is so easy though
[5:39:31] <asbestosflavored> GIT GUD
[5:39:32] <+Roundelay11> The overmind and SOURCE of the infection
[5:39:33] <%ArcanumMBD> @ooblagis yeah I know. spending hours fighting AR is making regular Radiance look like a joke, lol
[5:39:33] <zal_silverfang> naw just beat it though
[5:39:35] <AncelDeLambert> I hate this boss for this reason alone
[5:39:35] <custoadian> you get a free full heal after beating HK
[5:39:37] <OhioNitsud> git gud tho
[5:39:39] <hellfirejefe> not as bad as godmaster
[5:39:41] <blockedL> spin slash is good here
[5:39:43] <ryu1299> twitch is being shit and I'M MISSING THE GOOD STUFF
[5:39:44] <SatansDick1> ypure literally fighting the biocurse
[5:39:45] <+QuadraticGravity> I can't wait for pat to explain to Woolie just how much he missed on Monday
[5:39:45] <ShawnEXE> Thank god godmasters gives this boss justive
[5:39:46] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Once you finish the fight a lot of people will probably explain it
[5:39:46] <AncelDeLambert> I HATE having to do every single phase over again
[5:39:49] <strangelee> Now, take this to it's absurd conclusion for the kind of BS in Godmaster
[5:39:50] <%Sirculbs> This is nothing compared to Pantheon.
[5:39:50] <+th3madness> so yeah, malevolent god of rampant mindless growth sealed inside is a lot worse than the biocurse
[5:40:05] <$Mendin> Yeah on the other hand the White King managed to fucking Shove A God Into A Void Construct
[5:40:08] <+G_Thunders> This takes like no effort though, just spam til hornet shows up
[5:40:11] <IHATREID> @AngriestPat YOU GET ALL YOUR HEALTH BACK WHEN YOU DREAM NAIL HIM SO DONT WASTE SOUL
[5:40:11] <@StridentSong> It's somewhat advisable to go Blue Hearts for this fight. You don't get a lot of time to heal against The Radiance, and your HP is fully healed when you get there.
[5:40:13] <Coystick> Here we goooo
[5:40:13] <%thunderborn32> GIT GUD - Hornet
[5:40:14] <%TheImmortal70> GET THROUGH
[5:40:14] <Hydrapissed> GIT GUD
[5:40:14] <glass_marcus> The worst part about radiance is fighting hollow knight before it every goddam time

[5:40:19] <fillamar> don't heal
[5:40:21] <%cryobyjorn> Git Gud

[5:40:28] <+LtShuckle> GIT GUD
[5:40:28] <+th3madness> don't waste soul healing
[5:40:28] <Tisaric> it's so much more sick
[5:40:29] <ooblagis> The Radiance isn't necessarily evil, just very pissed the King undid her kingdom.
[5:40:31] <ukokira> Honestly just face tank HK
[5:40:36] <ukokira> I dunno
[5:40:36] <Tampaoster> GIT GOOD INTENSIFIES

[5:40:40] <%Sirculbs> GIT GUD!

[5:40:47] <%Divryne> Is this Touhou?

[5:41:04] <ThetaFive> BORN TO DIE HALLOWNEST IS A FUCK 410,757,864,530 DEAD KNIGHTS
[5:41:10] <rathma301> The Radiance
[5:41:12] <+JavaManJoJo> SourPls
[5:41:13] <+TehBeerBaron> Don't heal before you dream nail, you auto heal when you go inside. Save the soul
[5:41:17] <grayjammer> So by now you've probably realised that your "Fighting Hollow Knight" build isn't gonna cut it gainst the Radiance
[5:41:17] <Pairoschuz> It was a while ago, but the statue at Hallownest's crown is a statue of this god
[5:41:18] <ooblagis> She has also been trapped, going mad for millenia.
[5:41:18] <kwangalang> This such a dumb boss wtf , damn
[5:41:19] <IHATREID> @AngriestPat YOU GET ALL YOUR HEALTH BACK WHEN YOU DREAM NAIL HIM SO DONT WASTE SOUL

[5:41:47] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat everyone forgot it
[5:41:49] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Lore, you'll get it explained
[5:41:50] <Diego_Umejuarez> whats the charm that lets you move while healing?
[5:41:51] <SkullKingKota> bloodborne like boss
[5:41:53] <agustorm123> Ez boss tho
[5:41:55] <+th3madness> so the radiance is mindless growth
[5:41:56] <ukokira> Just scream at her
[5:41:56] <Daniel_Is_I> @AngriestPat You get a bit of lore explanation when you get 2400 essence
[5:42:01] <IHATREID> 7 level 1 nail strikes anyway
[5:42:01] <AncelDeLambert> he's a war god, promises light, but brings death
[5:42:01] <orlauncelot> Will screaming do big damage against this boss?
[5:42:02] <$Mendin> Listen sometimes when you let Jesus into your heart, you get the biocurse
[5:42:02] <+th3madness> the wyrm was intelligence
[5:42:03] <bliksnort> Because she's pissed.
[5:42:03] <Aldsan> PAT PROTIP: Remember you can sit at the bench to refill all of your Soul now, since you have Salubra's Blessing
[5:42:04] <Tisaric> It took me like 8 hours to be finally beat this asshole
[5:42:05] <fillamar> Cause its an asshole
[5:42:06] <KatabolicRage> by the king how radiant
[5:42:06] <$rdark_ksu> sometimes light burns
[5:42:07] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Because moths are fucked
[5:42:07] <TomerTop> Punishment for betraying him
[5:42:08] <wunderkonig> @AngriestPat want lore now or later?
[5:42:09] <fillamar> Sje
[5:42:10] <$magikestral> she didn't always fuck them up @angriestpat
[5:42:12] <%OceanGovernor> You ever see what happens when a moth flies into a lightbulb pat?
[5:42:13] <xeros720> excess jesus
[5:42:13] <fillamar> She's an asshole
[5:42:13] <filialpails> and why does it look like a moth
[5:42:14] <%AbnormalVoid> Cause they sealed it away in favor of the king
[5:42:14] <ShawnEXE> The bugs weren't always intelligent
[5:42:16] <%skizzuto> because it's pissed everyone worships the king instead of it
[5:42:16] <%cryobyjorn> H I V E M I N D G O D
[5:42:17] <%Kirijuo> Not A, THE Deity og Light
[5:42:17] <AncelDeLambert> have you READ holy books, Pat?
[5:42:17] <WaffleLeech> Literally just wants all the attention
[5:42:18] <Eresus> get 2400 essence for the answer
[5:42:19] <Prism_Wing> R E L I G I O N
[5:42:19] <+th3madness> wyrm convinced the moths to help him seal it away
[5:42:20] <+G_Thunders> Didn’t Radiance give you the dream nail in that early sequence?
[5:42:21] <Pigbuster> The king basically tried to replace old moth god, then they dug up that statue and were like "cool, free god" and then they all went crazy
[5:42:21] <%Kratok> A god would never lie to people
[5:42:21] <SkullKingKota> someone was praising the sun to much
[5:42:23] <+Gorgen> Moths are stupid. the just fly into fire
[5:42:24] <lilybergo> Its almost like a big real world metaphor or something :^)
[5:42:24] <+Camail> orlauncelot yea, it hits 3 times because radiance is stationary
[5:42:25] <%SmolBluGhost> the suns a lying fuck
[5:42:26] <%Kghaleon> The true final boss is a bug zapper.
[5:42:26] <ooblagis> Radiance is the original God of the land, the King usurped her position
[5:42:26] <%Dimfish> light causes them to follow basic instincts, pale king said fuck all that and sealed it away
[5:42:29] <+yet_another_brony> the radiance is light and light is tbe infextiin
[5:42:30] <%Agami23> the real question is, why dont we?
[5:42:31] <element_of_loyalty> Scream
[5:42:31] <grayjammer> Fair
[5:42:32] <Donchalant402> do you think your mind could comprehend a higher being?
[5:42:35] <%Sirculbs> It's a shame he won't see some of the special bosses in Pantheon.
[5:42:36] <fillamar> We know, just talking to ourselves
[5:42:41] <TomerTop> YOU WERE HIT BY HIM HITTING HIMSELF
[5:42:44] <dandyspider> the pale king/wyrm made the bugs forget the old god so he could replace her
[5:42:49] <ValidVenasaur> Up B is pretty good in the Radiance fight
[5:42:50] <Tampaoster> brb
[5:42:50] <wired_soul> why him stab himseflfS??
[5:42:50] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat Spam Up+B for tons of damage on radiance.
[5:42:50] <+th3madness> how embarassing
[5:42:53] <fillamar> oof
[5:42:56] <Hydrapissed> o0o0o0 boi
[5:42:56] <ukokira> He did say that he was eventually gonna stream Godmaster
[5:42:56] <$Kefbar> @AngriestPat dont regard your life in the first fight you get filled up on life in the second fight
[5:42:58] <%SmolBluGhost> oof
[5:43:00] <$magikestral> you get fully healed when you dreamnail, and your up B is super good against her
[5:43:01] <element_of_loyalty> Pat use scream
[5:43:01] <+th3madness> as expected of pat of pain
[5:43:01] <strangelee> Hey Chat, did he ever find PK?
[5:43:02] <rathma301> still fighting the corruption
[5:43:03] <$SGrim> DIED TO GYWN rooKek
[5:43:03] <ukokira> It just won't be for a while
[5:43:04] <+Jaysky> I think the pale king tried to get people to stop worshipping the radiance, and radiance didn't like that
[5:43:05] <%Dimfish> he stabs himself because he wants to die
[5:43:12] <$magikestral> he always did give in
[5:43:13] <wsintai> @wired_soul He's trying to let you kill him, but the corruption is controlling his body
[5:43:18] <wired_soul> oh
[5:43:22] <+th3madness> he's like an animal chewing off its own limb
[5:43:25] <SchroedingersFerret> The Radiance is a jealous god that got mad when the white king went full Atatürk.
[5:43:30] <vampireinarm> man pat sure does like eating it and the start of every fight
[5:43:37] <ooblagis> The Pale King completely dethroned her.
[5:43:40] <vampireinarm> at
[5:43:43] <$nademonkey1100> what i miss i lef when he was in white tower place
[5:43:43] <Fruitywhompus> he's either trying to kill himself or spread as much corruption as possible
[5:43:43] <SubjectX07x> Sooo this guy is Artorias, kinda?
[5:43:46] <$magikestral> him, no, her yes
[5:43:48] <%skizzuto> it's good against the radiance tho
[5:43:50] <Donchalant402> ITS AMAZING on Radience
[5:43:55] <+th3madness> he knows what's inside him and he hates it
[5:43:56] <+QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat Actual pro tip, Radiance has no contact damage
[5:43:57] <OtterSlinger> He tried to counter 3 times in a row LUL
[5:43:58] <%thunderborn32> so does anyone notice he has the SAME body shape as the collector?
[5:43:59] <AncelDeLambert> Pat is slowly remembering he has options other than face fucking
[5:44:00] <+Jaysky> A bit like Artorias, yes
[5:44:02] <Pairoschuz> look at this noob spamming parry Kappa
[5:44:09] <ukokira> Radiance is a biiig girl
[5:44:16] <%Spydurman> spin to win
[5:44:18] <ukokira> And Scream does more damage on how much it hits
[5:44:22] <TomerTop> @QuadraticGravity i mean, it got blades coming out of its center...
[5:44:24] <$Mendin> GIT GUD
[5:44:25] <Tisaric> TIME IT
[5:44:25] <OtterSlinger> @thunderborn32 Missing the 2nd set of arms
[5:44:25] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat Against Radiance!
[5:44:29] <+velemi> GIT GUD
[5:44:29] <+Jaysky> I like that it stabbing itself actually does damage to himself
[5:44:32] <$magikestral> GIT GUD
[5:44:32] <+TheShal> GIT GUD
[5:44:33] <%TheMattman1313> GIT GUD!!
[5:44:33] <ukokira> Scream against Radiance pretty much gurantees every hit of it will land on her
[5:44:33] <Zanicedg> Spam Up B
[5:44:34] <Donchalant402> GIT GUD
[5:44:39] <element_of_loyalty> Kea Tue?
[5:44:40] <ShawnEXE> The cool thing about abyssal shriek being really good vs the radiance is the fact that the shriek is literally an attack using the agony of others
[5:44:40] <SatansDick1> up b agsinst god
[5:44:47] <ukokira> So with spell damage inceeasing charms
[5:44:47] <%thunderborn32> @OtterSlinger same skeleton with a reskin?
[5:44:48] <Tisaric> Up B is how I beat this
[5:44:53] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It's metaphysical but then it gets physical
[5:44:55] <AncelDeLambert> oh shit, that hit like three times
[5:45:01] <+Jaysky> Up B definitely helps in this fight yeah
[5:45:02] <ukokira> It can literally skip through her phases in seconds
[5:45:05] <lord_campbell96> @angriestpat Spell buff charms with the A plus up spell work exceptionally well on radiance
[5:45:05] <%Jpdodds> The Scream of the Void V.S. The Blades of Radiance
[5:45:14] <Tisaric> It hits so many times and does a fuckton of damage to it
[5:45:20] <ryu1299> when woolie said the final boss was easy I don't think be fought this?
[5:45:22] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> The curse manifests through your mind and dreams, then starts hitting your body
[5:45:25] <KatabolicRage> how grossly incandescent
[5:45:43] <+Jaysky> Woolie was very likely talking about the hollow knight, just before Radiance
[5:45:47] <ape_hawk> homing
[5:45:48] <Tisaric> @ryu1299 he for sure did not fight this, I don't think he saw white palace at all

[5:46:13] <+luftraumm1> full magic and spam
[5:46:17] <wunderkonig> I'd go for either spell buff or quicknail
[5:46:17] <aeonicvector> i'd personalyl suggest blue health with small regens, but i play very defensivley
[5:46:24] <Envy_the_spider> get the two healing charm
[5:46:24] <wunderkonig> preferably both
[5:46:41] <saltyvest> LOST SINNER?
[5:46:42] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> That's why the king dropped the soul master, he said that his shit came to him in a dream, and dreams are BAD NEWS
[5:46:43] <strangelee> Well, I work in the morning so I need to sleep. It's been fun everyone. And try to relax with the backseating and spoilers in the future.
[5:46:45] <Stupidittty> Brother! It's not finished yet.
[5:46:48] <Tisaric> There's actually a lot of moves you can heal through on Radiance if you get good RNG
[5:46:51] <zettig> !uptime
[5:46:51] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 46m 53s.
[5:46:52] <RedMaskBandit> .._so the moth ruled and none of the bugs had free will until the pale king(Pk) evovled from a worm and gave sapience to bugkind which is why the moth hates both pk and the player because his soul resides in the void heart.

[5:48:16] <+DakotaChip> What ghost dick
[5:48:25] <KatabolicRage> woolie should know better than to think he beat a game cos he saw credits
[5:48:29] <fillamar> What does Anita think of the Radiance?
[5:48:30] <KatabolicRage> he's playing auto tomato for gods sake

[5:49:07] <element_of_loyalty> people are still typing that :D
[5:49:07] <$Mendin> He beat the Path of Pain and walks into the Radiance's sword
[5:49:10] <+Bupkis7> You dashed into it!
[5:49:14] <+Jaysky> Searing bugs?
[5:49:17] <BakerBrute> White Palace is actually a tutorial on how to dodge this guys shit
[5:49:19] <TomerTop> PAT you can hit its legs if you do an up attack under them
[5:49:24] <TomerTop> no need to jump
[5:49:24] <wsintai> @AngriestPat I don't know how you can keep talking while you're eating that much shit
[5:49:27] <ShawnEXE> @AngriestPat consider changing build?

[5:49:44] <%b0neh34d> I believe in you @AngriestPat!
[5:49:46] <BakerBrute> @TomerTop those attacks only hit if hes low to the ground. Radiance neeeds to get hit on its fluffy body
[5:49:49] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat How are you so good at the Path of Pain but so bad at boss battles?
[5:49:50] <Fruitywhompus> you can do it !!!
[5:49:52] <%Tredecian> hes tired damn chat
[5:49:52] <+DakotaChip> Pat must be getting tired.
[5:49:59] <xeros720> you'll stop walking into her attacks one day
[5:50:03] <leole11> it's been 5 hours
[5:50:04] <$Mendin> The PoP probably fried his mental reaction abilities
[5:50:07] <%Sirculbs> !uptime
[5:50:07] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 50m 9s.
[5:50:13] <+Jaysky> I got through path of pain fairly easily, but was garbage at Radiance
[5:50:13] <hellfirejefe> i guess we lost count of deaths a while ago huh?
[5:50:13] <leole11> fucking 6
[5:50:23] <%Sirculbs> @angriestpat You've been playing for 6 hours dude.
[5:50:25] <miguelrod777> it's gonna be a snas where he'll do it first try next stream
[5:50:26] <Stupidittty> Boyo, you don't need to beat this boy today, go get some sleep.
[5:50:26] <$Mendin> But damn I hope Pat streams Godmaster because I want to see his reactions to the new bosses
[5:50:28] <element_of_loyalty> 15 to 2am
[5:50:28] <fillamar> In part 1 pat said that bosses were all easy, but simple platforming messed him up
[5:50:28] <%thunderborn32> he wants to die
[5:50:31] <rathma301> I recommend Hornet's advice it seems solid.
[5:50:31] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat If you absolutely have to take damage jump on the spikes from the ground cause they only do 1 damage instead of 2.
[5:50:33] <wsintai> @hellfirejefe Looks like the death counter guy is away right now
[5:50:34] <hntronium> He help you
[5:50:34] <Eresus> to kill himself
[5:50:35] <leole11> either to release the infection, or to die
[5:50:35] <+th3madness> he's trying to kill it
[5:50:35] <+Corvax__> he wants you to kill him
[5:50:35] <Theoyveyman> @AngriestPat He's helping you
[5:50:36] <lord_campbell96> ye
[5:50:36] <ryu1299> Yeah it's been 6 hours can't blame him for being tired
[5:50:37] <thisisacoolguy> He hates the radiance just as much as you do
[5:50:37] <+Jaysky> Yes Pat, he wants you to kill him
[5:50:37] <$rdark_ksu> His shift ended now its your turn
[5:50:37] <Donchalant402> he wants death
[5:50:38] <%TheImmortal70> He wants death
[5:50:38] <%TheMattman1313> GIT GUD!!
[5:50:38] <+yet_another_brony> suicide
[5:50:39] <$magikestral> he wants to die, clearly, he wants to help
[5:50:40] <ShawnEXE> He wants to die hence the sad music
[5:50:40] <%HiroTSK5> Gotta stab the evil away
[5:50:40] <fillamar> Not sure, probably
[5:50:40] <Tisaric> He's helping you
[5:50:40] <epylepticpanda> GIT GUD
[5:50:41] <ooblagis> yup
[5:50:45] <%Agami23> pat, you look at the hollow knight and tell me its not in pain
[5:50:46] <grayjammer> To Release His Limiters
[5:50:52] <SatansDick1> hes trying to help you but the goo is controlling him
[5:50:52] <DonatelloJose> Since sipsipGasm isn't here, we have to be encouraging. We should raise our hands to give him energy.
[5:50:55] <%Kghaleon> Dream nailing her just gets you "...Remember... Light..."
[5:50:58] <dandyspider> small part of himself remains
[5:51:12] <+JustToWatch> it could be the radiance trying to break her seal, or the knight trying to stop it
[5:51:19] <%thunderborn32> isnt this just ALL of the warrior challenges mixed? except for the shield one of course
[5:51:25] <TomerTop> he wants to kill himself, helping you with the bad ending basically. he knows he's losing his ability to hold radiance so he wants you to take his place. but nah, true ending, you ain't sealing shit, we killin
[5:51:26] <+Jaysky> I mean the hollow knight WAS designed to seal away the dreams
[5:51:27] <Tisaric> I love how many opportunites to heal there are in this fight once you know it
[5:51:28] <+solipants> this guy kinda sucks
[5:51:28] <glass_marcus> The floor spikes turn this from a not too bad boss, to a hard as balls boss.
[5:51:31] <epylepticpanda> The Hollow Knight is not evil. He's corrupted by the Radiance
[5:51:34] <spiegspikel> Those summon swords feel very reminiscent of Credo
[5:51:35] <kite1haseo> aleksGg aleksDab aleksDab
[5:51:42] <Diego_Umejuarez> @AngriestPat theres a charm that lets you heal while moving that i found super useful for this boss
[5:51:43] <legendarysabertooth> Heal you coward
[5:51:44] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat I advise putting on quickslash. I promise this will all go faster.
[5:51:47] <hntronium> Git Gud x7
[5:51:48] <element_of_loyalty> game over - terrible game design :(
[5:51:52] <%b0neh34d> @AngriestPat I believe!
[5:51:53] <+th3madness> suggestion
[5:51:53] <fillamar> Go lifeblood!
[5:51:56] <+th3madness> shape of un
[5:51:57] <$Mendin> Pat take a nap, dream of the Light
[5:51:58] <fillamar> lifeblood build
[5:51:58] <Fruitywhompus> Slow down pat !!
[5:52:01] <+DakotaChip> Apparently pat can only dodge or attack with how tired he is. He can't do both anymore.
[5:52:02] <TomerTop> THE MADMAN
[5:52:03] <fillamar> fuck healing
[5:52:05] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Your invulnerable dash doesn't just go through the projectiles, but rather CONSUMES them
[5:52:06] <%Sirculbs> Time to call it?
[5:52:13] <fillamar> lifeblood, no heal
[5:52:22] <wunderkonig> @AngriestPat you could try a spell build, divebomb hollow knight to death and shriek the radiance.
[5:52:35] <hntronium> Let's just call it a day and have an entire stream dedicated to the Radiance fight
[5:52:46] <destructo_dude> Silence and tapping. Like Chinese Water Torture.
[5:52:52] <fillamar> No
[5:52:53] <Tisaric> yeah I think a spell build with Up B is a really good way to cheese it
[5:52:57] <OhioNitsud> I can't go to bed until Pat beats this or gives up
[5:52:59] <wunderkonig> @hntronium or yeah that, it's a tough fight.
[5:53:00] <$Mendin> Oh man those squishy sounds
[5:53:04] <%Sirculbs> @wunderkonig Why do that when he can facefuck both to death? KappaHD
[5:53:07] <%Qdiddy533> GIT GUD
[5:53:08] <+reluctant_monkey> GIT GUD
[5:53:09] <element_of_loyalty> pat can't beat this mess
[5:53:09] <$Mendin> Git Gud attempt #eh
[5:53:18] <CptJackySparra> C'mon Pat, smash it's fucking skull in
[5:53:22] <wunderkonig> @Sirculbs because he's not using quicknail for maximum facefuck.
[5:53:47] <shadowgilgamesh> lifeblood isn't so good, since you can't facetank the HK
[5:53:49] <TomerTop> does he realize he's only on phase 1 out of like 3
[5:53:59] <Tisaric> PHASE 2
[5:54:00] <ooblagis> If Pat can get good at dodging, Grubberfly with Quickslash and Health boosters wrecks Radiance.
[5:54:00] <$Mendin> phase 3 boys
[5:54:06] <+th3madness> phase 2
[5:54:09] <hntronium> Git Gud x8
[5:54:09] <+velemi> You can do it Pat! Swat this moth!
[5:54:11] <element_of_loyalty> fuck this
[5:54:11] <%skizzuto> might want shaman's stone instead of quick slash
[5:54:11] <wunderkonig> @AngriestPat
[5:54:13] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat Remember you can get soul by sitting at the bench

[5:54:20] <AtlasMcCoy> 14 stages to go
[5:54:21] <%Sirculbs> phase 2 was starting
[5:54:22] <wunderkonig> @AngriestPat it's just s chees strat for a boss rush.

[5:54:31] <fillamar> no heal run, all soul hearts
[5:54:31] <xeros720> that's when she's almost dead, so you nearly got it
[5:54:31] <wunderkonig> @AngriestPat go spell build
[5:54:31] <$magikestral> soul twister
[5:54:36] <thisisacoolguy> Shape of Uun is trash in this fight wtf
[5:54:36] <Zanicedg> Shaman stone Yes.
[5:54:36] <Virhauk> yessss overcharm
[5:54:37] <DonatelloJose> Really? that looked like progress
[5:54:38] <ooblagis> AND HEALTH
[5:54:42] <SwindlerOfProgress> I used Quick Slash a lot.
[5:54:47] <+Jaysky> Overcharm means death
[5:54:49] <+th3madness> moving while healing is huge what are you on about
[5:54:55] <Tisaric> shape of unn is kind of useless, the places you're safe are all static
[5:54:56] <ryu1299> I count that as phase 3 bc the stage changed for a 2nd time
[5:55:00] <%TheImmortal70> There are very few attacks you can move and heal for radiance
[5:55:03] <%DevoBoss> how long has Pat been on The Radiance?
[5:55:04] <thisisacoolguy> Yeah moving when the final phase exists
[5:55:04] <%TheImmortal70> The swords would fuck him up
[5:55:05] <+discodemolition> I used quick slash and nail masters
[5:55:07] <Calek> why would you need to move while healing if you just don't get hit
[5:55:08] <TomerTop> lol pat just facetanking
[5:55:09] <$Mendin> oh god he's Paiging it
[5:55:09] <TomerTop> he's tilted
[5:55:16] <fillamar> Pretty much only last laser is confirmed safe
[5:55:20] <%thunderborn32> you know this whole game the only build he has avoided has been spellcaster but he has been relying on the spells a ton
[5:55:21] <+Corvax__> soul twister and shaman stone is a good spell build
[5:55:23] <OhioNitsud> LUL
[5:55:23] <LtThunderbolt> pffft
[5:55:24] <element_of_loyalty> blame the game
[5:55:25] <ShawnEXE> damn get stomped on
[5:55:26] <Goergorion> Stomp
[5:55:27] <hntronium> @TomerTop That's actually normal tbh
[5:55:28] <Fruitywhompus> Relax pat !!
[5:55:29] <DonatelloJose> Water break!
[5:55:32] <+Jaysky> Quick heal might help you Pat
[5:55:34] <%TheImmortal70> It's a HARD fight
[5:55:37] <LokimenD> Calm down, Pat
[5:55:37] <%QueequegTheater> Lot
[5:55:38] <ooblagis> GRUBBERFLY
[5:55:38] <+DakotaChip> Water break buddy.
[5:55:40] <%Kghaleon> I thought this was just a cute little game about bugs
[5:55:44] <%TheImmortal70> Nope
[5:55:45] <hntronium> Facetank hollow knight for the rush to radiance
[5:55:46] <+th3madness> grubberfly is shit
[5:55:49] <wunderkonig> @AngriestPat basically during the boss challenges if you equip qickslash for that 65% speedboost and steady body you can just wail and wail and wail in a battle of atrition.
[5:55:49] <%TheImmortal70> You're a monster and you gotta kill god
[5:55:50] <+th3madness> pat always eats a hit
[5:55:50] <SchroedingersFerret> The key to beating Radiance is to not take damage.
[5:55:52] <Tampaoster> The real pain is now
[5:55:54] <TomerTop> @hntronium dunno, new to the stream, usually just watch him backsit on the youtube videos
[5:55:54] <+Jaysky> Oh yes the game is very cute
[5:55:59] <AncelDeLambert> coming up on six hours here, we got another full time stream, folks
[5:56:00] <ShawnEXE> Pat is no longer reacting oh no
[5:56:07] <iwa5h4ck3d> stop face fucking him!
[5:56:08] <Tisaric> There's a ton of opportunities to heal on Radiance but you have to be on the lookout for them
[5:56:09] <Eresus> omg
[5:56:10] <leole11> pat is tired
[5:56:12] <Theoyveyman> Tilt
[5:56:12] <@SSaryn> Hey guys, as much as you think saying things are shit is helpful advice, might wanna stop. I think he gets it.
[5:56:12] <hntronium> @TomerTop No, its normal for people challenging Radiance
[5:56:16] <+TeethMuncher> His smile and optimism: gone
[5:56:18] <fillamar> Tilted vessel
[5:56:19] <KnivesEve> CHANNEL YOUR INNER PAIGE PAT
[5:56:20] <Stupidittty> The key to beating Radiance is hiting it until it dies.
[5:56:21] <AtlasMcCoy> Maybe its time to call it a night and finish another stream, it's been a fairly long stream already.
[5:56:22] <%Sirculbs> tired boi is tired
[5:56:23] <%Spydurman> if you can beat Sans you can beat bug god
[5:56:24] <+th3madness> why didn't you heeeeeeeeeal

[5:56:43] <wsintai> @SSaryn The most helpful thing now is sleep
[5:56:44] <ooblagis> GRUBBERFLY
[5:56:46] <+AXL808> You need more eyes on the inside, Pat
[5:56:47] <ekkieekk> finding when to heal in radiance is valuable
[5:56:48] <miguelrod777> SLEEP
[5:56:48] <thisisacoolguy> Pat has logged out
[5:56:52] <wired_soul> whos making that whoo whoo sound O__O
[5:56:53] <+Fenlig> Night everyone, good luck Pat!
[5:56:53] <@thenefftw> !uptime
[5:56:53] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 56m 55s.
[5:56:54] <+DakotaChip> Guys relax. He's tired and it's been six hours. Just be supportive.
[5:56:54] <+JustToWatch> just ask Jiren to do it for you
[5:56:57] <wunderkonig> @AngriestPat good shaman stones a 50% increase to abyss shriek

[5:57:03] <Theoyveyman> COME BACK TO THIS SHIT TOMORROW
[5:57:05] <@thenefftw> I think sleep is in order
[5:57:05] <cisealnine> This fight is easy.
[5:57:09] <Diego_Umejuarez> did pat forget about healing...
[5:57:10] <wunderkonig> and 30 or so to everything else
[5:57:12] <SchroedingersFerret> Not many people know this, but Hollow Knights weakness is being hit with your nail.
[5:57:12] <wsintai> I think Pat died awhile ago, and his body is just on autopilot
[5:57:13] <%Sirculbs> @the
[5:57:14] <%TheImmortal70> He doesn't want to come back to this
[5:57:15] <$magikestral> remember, ALL spells are better now. HK won't know what'll hit him
[5:57:15] <miguelrod777> PLS SLEEP IT 2AM
[5:57:19] <DivineDragoonKain> Use your attack spells if you're using shaman stone
[5:57:27] <%TheImmortal70> He's pretty much said once story is done he's not gonna stream anything from this for a good while
[5:57:31] <legendarysabertooth> Summon Tarkus
[5:57:31] <Eresus> you need to learn the boss instead of facetanking all his hits
[5:57:31] <+Jaysky> Hollow Knight is simple, Radiance is a beeeetch
[5:57:32] <Theoyveyman> !uptime
[5:57:32] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 57m 34s.
[5:57:33] <grayjammer> GANBATTE
[5:57:34] <DonatelloJose> Guys let him progress.
[5:57:35] <%Sirculbs> @thenefftw Agreed. He's made enough progress for one night.
[5:57:35] <AncelDeLambert> Pat has finally reached the point I did in this game: maximum saturation
[5:57:37] <$Mendin> Pat has surrendered his autonomy to the Radiance and is empowered, but reduced to his base instincts
[5:57:45] <Fruitywhompus> He said he doesnt wanna stream this game again anytime soon so he probs just wants to finish it
[5:57:53] <element_of_loyalty> this battle stinks
[5:57:54] <wsintai> @AncelDeLambert COMPLETE GLOBAL SATURATION* fixed for ya

[5:58:23] <legendarysabertooth> The 1 bois
[5:58:24] <natebud> wait until he finds out about stage 3 Kappa

[5:58:44] <Tisaric> PHASE 2
[5:58:45] <hntronium> @TomerTop HK is easy. Pat's only problem is that his soul has already left his body

[5:59:32] <AncelDeLambert> this fight is just too long

[5:59:38] <legendarysabertooth> Dig up stupid
[5:59:39] <%Spydurman> swarm build!
[5:59:41] <$magikestral> Pat isn't ready for spell build
[5:59:42] <DonatelloJose> GUY stop telling him to stop
[5:59:43] <thisisacoolguy> Steady Body helps
[5:59:46] <kabishen> did pat do path of pain?
[5:59:46] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Winions
[5:59:46] <+DakotaChip> You have to learn the fight and just get better. The build isn't the problem you dingus.
[5:59:48] <Tampaoster> grimchild
[5:59:49] <ThetaFive> Nail'em
[5:59:50] <i_do_yur_mom_yung_midorya> i did a blue mask build
[5:59:53] <BakerBrute> do full blue hearts
[5:59:54] <+mitchteck> Healing build
[5:59:54] <grayjammer> Guys let him play the way he wants
[5:59:56] <+luftraumm1> spell build depends on perfect execution
[5:59:56] <TomerTop> @hntronium E X C A C T L Y thats why I said he was tilted :D
[5:59:59] <DonatelloJose> He is doing great
[5:59:59] <%Tredecian> @kabishen yes
[6:00:00] <Dunric_Mordamir> @kabishen yes
[6:00:02] <+Roundelay11> Not going to try winions?
[6:00:11] <%TheImmortal70> Stable
[6:00:12] <AtlasMcCoy> The problem is the boss is fuckin hard and takes a lot of practice
[6:00:12] <Zanicedg> We are gonna be here all night.
[6:00:13] <0rond> spellbuild got you furthest first try lmao
[6:00:13] <Tisaric> Spell build with Up B spam was how I got through it
[6:00:15] <Rellim80> UUN FOR HEALING WITH MOVEMENT
[6:00:19] <element_of_loyalty> Three Levels to the Lousy boss battle?
[6:00:19] <+DakotaChip> Ah. Fair enough
[6:00:20] <+MrDrProfessorAJ> just attack him 4Head
[6:00:23] <+luftraumm1> but hes got it
[6:00:30] <grimporio> @AngriestPat like a long range spell, you mean?
[6:00:31] <+luftraumm1> jsut a matter of learning
[6:00:31] <wunderkonig> @AngriestPat ...like the vengeful spirit?
[6:00:32] <%TheImmortal70> Unn ain't gonna help on platforms
[6:00:35] <Stupidittty> Shoot it until it dies.
[6:00:39] <element_of_loyalty> David Cage would never design an ending like this.
[6:00:46] <cptbellybutton352> hows it going patty
[6:00:49] <Tisaric> Yeah I love Unn but I didn't have a use for it in this
[6:00:50] <fillamar> You should still try blue heart build, makes hollow lad less stressful
[6:00:51] <%thunderborn32> lets be honest if he uses winions or spell build to glass cannon through it people will argue and say he cheated his way through anyway
[6:00:53] <ThetaFive> At least Pat's getting decent at this phase
[6:00:54] <+luftraumm1> david cage wishes his games had this depth
[6:00:54] <%vobent> apatBig
[6:00:55] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat It took me like a full 5 hour trip with my laptop to do this, so don't feel too pressured
[6:00:59] <damienlunas> GIT GUD
[6:01:02] <DonatelloJose> new strategy. GIT GUD
[6:01:04] <%skizzuto> GIT GUD
[6:01:14] <element_of_loyalty> that meme stinks
[6:01:23] <Calek> @AngriestPat it took me 3 tries so git gud Kappa
[6:01:30] <legendarysabertooth> Move fucker!
[6:01:34] <%Spydurman> doesn't he have a ghost bullet to shoot?
[6:01:40] <$Mendin> the mark of her divinity shall scar thy DNA
[6:01:45] <ivangood2> is it pantheon ?
[6:01:46] <SchroedingersFerret> What're you doing Pat?
[6:01:50] <Stupidittty> He's reading your imputs.
[6:01:52] <+GuelermeDias> did pat stop being bad
[6:02:00] <%Sirculbs> @ivangood2 no
[6:02:00] <SkullKingKota> he's tired, what don't u guys get about that
[6:02:00] <%TheImmortal70> dps check
[6:02:04] <+GuelermeDias> ye
[6:02:10] <element_of_loyalty> this again
[6:02:16] <$Mendin> wait you can thread the needle on those spear rains
[6:02:16] <fillamar> you can, but not then
[6:02:19] <cptbellybutton352> ha! good one @GuelermeDias
[6:02:24] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> The radiance doesn't hae anything interesting in her dream nail talk
[6:02:25] <legendarysabertooth> Dig up
[6:02:28] <Theoyveyman> Pat's mental state is rapidly deteriorating
[6:02:29] <natebud> You can fit in the small gap between those falling spears
[6:02:30] <ivangood2> balls
[6:02:34] <KatabolicRage> I seriously need to go back and see him do the white palace
[6:02:35] <+GuelermeDias> i guess not
[6:02:35] <hntronium> How many tries is this now? 9 or 10?
[6:02:35] <IHATREID> personally, i used quick slash and grubberflys elegy and didnt get hit/healed to keep using the projectile
[6:02:36] <element_of_loyalty> this eats
[6:02:36] <Maerk> juust don't get hit Kappa
[6:02:37] <Donchalant402> DODGE
[6:02:41] <$magikestral> you're doing goos
[6:02:42] <+th3madness> it's preferable to fall into the void than eat a hit from radiance
[6:02:43] <$rdark_ksu> you got this patron!
[6:02:43] <+greenfall> getting better
[6:02:43] <ooblagis> Listen, grubberfly let's you attack with impunity, it let's you watch and understand the Radiances attack patterns and fight much safer while doing damage. You need to do those two things to win
[6:02:44] <Zanicedg> Pat should go to bed.
[6:02:45] <+luftraumm1> that last phase is longer than it seems
[6:02:45] <damienlunas> @AngriestPat Here's something that helped me. As soon as you take damage, start looking for an opportunity to heal it. Stay ahead of the curve.
[6:02:45] <AncelDeLambert> king of the void yet falling into it harms you
[6:02:47] <KnivesEve> maybe this is next morning finish?
[6:02:47] <AFriendlyDinosaur> this boss is hard but fair imo. took me a couple hours I think
[6:02:48] <Tampaoster> grimchild man
[6:02:50] <%thunderborn32> ikr
[6:02:51] <custoadian> shape of unn helped me a lot to heal during the spear rain phase
[6:02:52] <%Sirculbs> !uptime
[6:02:52] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 6h 2m 53s.
[6:02:56] <ekkieekk> follow hornets advice
[6:02:57] <+th3madness> pat will never not eat a hit though
[6:02:57] <ThetaFive> Void fall only does 1 damage?
[6:02:58] <grimporio> hit the light demon until it dies
[6:03:01] <TomerTop> >already beat radiance
[6:03:01] <+greenfall> learn the patterns
[6:03:01] <ammobasket> Progress!
[6:03:01] <$magikestral> i think that's the joke, pat
[6:03:02] <+keksisblyat> I BELIEVE GivePLZ TakeNRG GivePLZ TakeNRG GivePLZ TakeNRG GivePLZ TakeNRG
[6:03:02] <element_of_loyalty> typical game fans
[6:03:04] <%chiluzza> Dont get hit
[6:03:06] <%chiluzza> is really easy
[6:03:08] <cptbellybutton352> patt just do it like wtf
[6:03:11] <%chiluzza> it just tkaes gitgud
[6:03:13] <miguelrod777> don't die
[6:03:17] <Tisaric> Yeah you want to heal before you think you need to most of the time
[6:03:19] <fillamar> She says ANCIENT ENEMY and other pissed off things
[6:03:21] <+th3madness> also, charged hits exist pat
[6:03:22] <nepwar> i never did like boss battles where hitting the ground meant death
[6:03:23] <KatabolicRage> pat you should see people do the radiance with "no pickup" runs where health and soul is scorned
[6:03:24] <%thunderborn32> you know spinning shield would actually be great on this boss
[6:03:26] <0rond> @AngriestPat take steady body it's bloody amazing
[6:03:28] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat The last tip I could possibly give you is that the radiance light beam spread thing always locks onto you at some point. It'll aim at you, then the spots it didn't cover immediately afterwards
[6:03:32] <TomerTop> pat just do the most damage to the enemy while avoiding their damage wtf
[6:03:37] <grayjammer> "Just dont get hit" wow, did you guys go to Joke School, to learn how to craft jokes so original and insightful?
[6:03:38] <element_of_loyalty> 2am est
[6:03:39] <DonatelloJose> Pat drop your shield.
[6:03:50] <legendarysabertooth> Pat you’ve faced Gwyn hundreds of times just do it 1 more time
[6:03:51] <hellfirejefe> anyone else out here who's beaten ABSOLUTE that shit's wild
[6:03:51] <%TheImmortal70> Ew, that sure is a bad case of ligma
[6:03:52] <Diego_Umejuarez> @AngriestPat pro tip if you are DEFINITELY gonna take damage, falling off into void does less than getting hit
[6:03:59] <SchroedingersFerret> You just have to know where his attacks hit and not be at those places Kappa
[6:04:01] <ivangood2> GOT GOD
[6:04:02] <hntronium> Git Gud x10
[6:04:02] <epylepticpanda> GIT GUD
[6:04:03] <Donchalant402> GIT GUD
[6:04:05] <wunderkonig> @AngriestPat if you want to focus on dodging a bit you could always try using grimchild to do consistent damage while you focus on not getting hit. Tackle the fight however you want, there aren't really any wrong answers...except overcharming.
[6:04:07] <wired_soul> equip the cute little flying bug friend hes cute
[6:04:12] <+velemi> Listen to Hornet, Pat
[6:04:13] <grayjammer> NO USE *MY* FAVOURITE CHARMS [bangs fists on the table]
[6:04:22] <0rond> this is like fighting artorias than in the middle of the artorias fight you fight manos
[6:04:24] <%Minorou> Skelmo is in open-mouthed awe at Pat's tenacity
[6:04:24] <fillamar> chill out, gray
[6:04:32] <TomerTop> gj dodging the balls, make them crash on the floor just like that
[6:04:33] <+Gorgen> Zote would of beaten this boss on his first try
[6:04:35] <%JoshyJ> come on pat u can do et
[6:04:39] <ThetaFive> Not use MY build that you've never used before and have no time to practice with!
[6:04:51] <element_of_loyalty> after the last 10 times?
[6:05:00] <Tisaric> yeah there you go
[6:05:02] <wunderkonig> Yeah I'd imagine zote's dream version of himself would one shot the radiance
[6:05:03] <$Mendin> Seraphic Edge
[6:05:04] <Tisaric> learning the healing areas
[6:05:04] <TomerTop> oh nu
[6:05:04] <DonatelloJose> Good try
[6:05:06] <%JoshyJ> monkaS
[6:05:08] <ThetaFive> Yikes
[6:05:15] <%thunderborn32> the double hp and speed healing combo might be good for him since he likes speed eating in monster hunter
[6:05:18] <ivangood2> xephHp xephHp xephHp xephHp xephHp xephHp xephHp xephHp xephHp xephHp
[6:05:18] <Coystick> Stop getting hit.
[6:05:19] <+GuelermeDias> pat gets hit once and just dies
[6:05:22] <+GuelermeDias> it's amazing
[6:05:22] <%JoshyJ> RIP
[6:05:22] <ChineseNininga> @AngriestPat try dashmaster and max nail range
[6:05:30] <Psyramics> might just be tired
[6:05:30] <wunderkonig> IF only our knight had a more inflated self image this fight would be easier.
[6:05:32] <+th3madness> deep focus as well as quick soul
[6:05:32] <DonatelloJose> Progress is being made
[6:05:32] <Rellim80> Quick Heal w/Dash Master & Shape of Uun. It's movement and ducking while healing.
[6:05:32] <%skizzuto> that horizontal spike attack is the worst
[6:05:32] <Coystick> No STOP getting hit, jeez
[6:05:34] <AncelDeLambert> time for bed
[6:05:35] <TomerTop> @GuelermeDias yup
[6:05:35] <ekkieekk> not being afraid to cancel your heals is definitely helping
[6:05:39] <Psyramics> he been at it for 6 hours
[6:05:40] <+Hotironclad> You got this dude
[6:05:42] <ValidVenasaur> pat gets so tilted after 1 hit
[6:05:47] <%Kghaleon> Might have to just finish him tomorrow, you did beat Path of pain today
[6:05:47] <legendarysabertooth> It gets ruff man no pressure
[6:05:52] <ryu1299> @guelermedias that about sums up the boss tbh
[6:05:59] <Stupidittty> Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.
[6:06:01] <element_of_loyalty> Its Monday Morning
[6:06:03] <%Sirculbs> I dunno if I can keep watching.
[6:06:05] <aeonicvector> if i may be so bold, if you want to focus more on the defense, a Joni + honey means your hp losses will be smaller overall, and your mana is just for spells
[6:06:07] <fillamar> everyone does, if you get hid by the first attack then its a cursed run after
[6:06:10] <ekkieekk> and radiance isnt even the hardest boss in the game anymore
[6:06:17] <$Mendin> Wednesday Already?
[6:06:21] <Rada150> HURT ME MORE SNAKE
[6:06:22] <+Hotironclad> Lets go!
[6:06:23] <TomerTop> like my combo was the vines when i get hit and the healing shield cuz I sucked at timing my heals, so may as well deal some damage
[6:06:28] <Fruitywhompus> Eh I think he just needs to learn the fight, he's got it
[6:06:30] <fillamar> Radience isn't the hardest boss anymore, the Radience is
[6:06:31] <hntronium> Git Gud x11
[6:06:33] <%Sirculbs> GIT GUD!
[6:06:33] <DonatelloJose> \ sipsipGasm / Take my energy Pat
[6:06:36] <ThetaFive> Pat just has to bruteforce learning the patterns
[6:06:37] <Sodium_Chloride09> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[6:06:46] <fillamar> good shit
[6:06:59] <%QueequegTheater> apatCanada apatCanada apatCanada apatCanada apatCanada
[6:07:05] <%TheImmortal70> No mouth to voice pain "Literally the screams of hell as an attack"
[6:07:09] <TomerTop> @fillamar Ascended Radiance MaxLOL
[6:07:11] <ekkieekk> thems good dodging
[6:07:12] <$Mendin> Watching this makes me want to fight the PV some more, it absolutely wreckks me but I can't hate it because it's SO COOL
[6:07:13] <aeonicvector> ok THAT was a legit mid fight heal
[6:07:14] <DonatelloJose> Good dodge! Yeah buddy
[6:07:15] <Tisaric> There's a good amount of healing times he still hasn't made use of which really helps
[6:07:19] <ekkieekk> nvm
[6:07:19] <%TheImmortal70> Those hits were in rhythm
[6:07:22] <grayjammer> *holds up a big sign saying "Go Pat!!!!"*
[6:07:24] <%TheImmortal70> I really like that
[6:07:32] <TomerTop> second phase!
[6:07:37] <element_of_loyalty> three more
[6:07:37] <TomerTop> THIRD PHASE
[6:07:47] <ThetaFive> There we go, learn those patterns
[6:07:50] <+Suplexsenpai> GIVE HIM YOU'RE ENERGY!!
[6:07:52] <ooblagis> wait
[6:07:55] <ooblagis> way
[6:07:59] <ooblagis> wat
[6:08:06] <element_of_loyalty> 2
[6:08:07] <SwindlerOfProgress> The invincible dash is a charm, there's no way it would be mandatory.
[6:08:09] <element_of_loyalty> 1
[6:08:09] <Theoyveyman> @AngriestPat Do you plan on doing the DLCs at some point in the future?
[6:08:10] <TomerTop> welp
[6:08:11] <+GuelermeDias> that wasn't a track
[6:08:11] <ValidVenasaur> they dont
[6:08:12] <element_of_loyalty> end
[6:08:12] <%skizzuto> no they just curve and you got unlucky
[6:08:14] <damienlunas> @AngriestPat don't forget you have Nail Arts too.
[6:08:14] <@StridentSong> They don't track, they curbve
[6:08:15] <%Tredecian> curve not track
[6:08:15] <$rdark_ksu> not sure if track I think they just curve
[6:08:15] <LtThunderbolt> iddKekD
[6:08:17] <Eresus> they do not
[6:08:17] <SatansDick1> they dont
[6:08:18] <+GuelermeDias> that was a pat not dodging
[6:08:18] <Coystick> Good try
[6:08:18] <$magikestral> they curve
[6:08:18] <+th3madness> they don't track, the spiral
[6:08:19] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat They curve in the direction they spawn in
[6:08:19] <Sodium_Chloride09> sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn
[6:08:20] <+TehBeerBaron> They do not track
[6:08:21] <Fruitywhompus> nah bad rng dude
[6:08:21] <+JustToWatch> @AngriestPat getting your 9th mask might help
[6:08:22] <Tampaoster> crazy talk
[6:08:23] <+Hotironclad> You're learning due
[6:08:23] <grayjammer> It doesn't track, it just has gravity
[6:08:24] <%Kghaleon> nah, they curve
[6:08:25] <AncelDeLambert> Unified the Void...
[6:08:26] <legendarysabertooth> You’re getting it though
[6:08:29] <+TehBeerBaron> They don't spiral either
[6:08:30] <%TheImmortal70> @AngriestPat so if it comes in clockwise, it'll curve clockwise
[6:08:31] <element_of_loyalty> *Beating a dead Horse*
[6:08:33] <+TehBeerBaron> They go straight
[6:08:34] <%Sirculbs> apatFist apatFist
[6:08:36] <DonatelloJose> The fight isn't THAT cruel.
[6:08:37] <%Dingus_Tickler> Oof, this looks really tough
[6:08:41] <+th3madness> grimm makes radiance look like hollow knight
[6:08:41] <%HiroTSK5> Come Hell or High Water
[6:08:41] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @SwindlerOfProgress It isn't a charm, it's a mandatory upgrade, since you can only do that fight with the void heart, which you need the invincible dash to get
[6:08:44] <element_of_loyalty> You mean...this morning?
[6:08:46] <ivangood2> DLC is so good
[6:08:46] <kite1haseo> aleksTilted
[6:08:46] <%vobent> apatFist
[6:08:48] <kabishen> boss rushes are boring
[6:08:53] <KatabolicRage> honestly I don't think the big hard mode stuff is for pat, maybe the hornet mode when that comes
[6:08:55] <TomerTop> but pat WhAt AbOUt ThE SeCrEt EnDiNG
[6:08:55] <+Trair> Holy fuck just tuned in for a second and BIG SPOILS
[6:08:58] <KnivesEve> after this is claire b of re2 right?
[6:09:00] <ooblagis> I think Pat has the big salt
[6:09:02] <Virhauk> i would like to see him do the eternal ordeal tho
[6:09:04] <%vobent> apatCanada
[6:09:07] <tremerss> the last colosieum is super fun tho
[6:09:08] <Stupidittty> Yeah, game is loosing a lot when it's just bosses without exploration.
[6:09:11] <tremerss> but i get it
[6:09:12] <thisisacoolguy> I wish he looked at the dlc stuff, tons of new bosses and stuff
[6:09:12] <MrSuplexArt> I think the last dlc is super not great for streaming
[6:09:12] <+DakotaChip> Great going chat. You pushed him to doing Path of Pain and now he's done with the game after this. ;_;
[6:09:16] <+JavaManJoJo> Do you think you'll go back when Hornet comes out?
[6:09:18] <Daniel_Is_I> Yeah I'm usually a completionist and even I don't have the will to go through the last part of Godseeker.
[6:09:18] <scrumdrew> the new 2 final dlc bosses make nkg look like gruz mother
[6:09:20] <%vobent> apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace
[6:09:23] <$Kefbar> you need to not be greedy with healing and casting think like in a dark souls game
[6:09:31] <hntronium> Git Gud x12
[6:09:32] <+seaearthandsky> @AngriestPat did you see the leaked dmc 5 footage?
[6:09:33] <element_of_loyalty> This game deserves its salt
[6:09:33] <mothdude> Get Duuune!
[6:09:36] <asbestosflavored> GIT GUD
[6:09:38] <TomerTop> oh yeah, you're able to date Hornet in the next DLC, right? pat would love that
[6:09:40] <ThetaFive> Everyone paid him for PoP so he has no reason to play after this
[6:09:44] <element_of_loyalty> get fuk
[6:09:49] <DonatelloJose> We had a good run. seems like HK got Pat on a great streaming schedule.
[6:09:52] <%Sirculbs> Too bad he won't experience Pantheon on screen and we won't see his reaction to the *cough* special bosses *cough*
[6:09:57] <Tisaric> yeah I'm good with my like 107% completion without touching godmaster
[6:10:02] <fillamar> @DakotaChip nothing much for him after besides fool challenge and godmaster
[6:10:25] <%TheImmortal70> I just realized
[6:10:31] <%TheImmortal70> The goddamn swords are like Sans' bones
[6:10:43] <Baconrath> lots of visual noise
[6:10:43] <samfaust> You can bounce on the floor spikes fyi.
[6:10:44] <VoyRising> This harder than the last Valkyrie in God of War, Pat?
[6:10:44] <hellfirejefe> @AngriestPat there IS a new ending in godmaster if you just wanna look that shit up
[6:10:47] <Tisaric> This is very Sans like, yeah
[6:10:49] <element_of_loyalty> and again
[6:10:49] <Baconrath> classic shmup
[6:10:51] <TomerTop> phase 1 death feelsbadman
[6:10:51] <+GuelermeDias> that was all pat's fault
[6:10:52] <Theoyveyman> oof
[6:10:53] <fillamar> Fuck off matpat
[6:10:54] <DivineDragoonKain> healing in the middle of attacks
[6:10:54] <+Suplexsenpai> sbfpSetIn
[6:10:58] <$Kefbar> the greed is killing you
[6:11:00] <+hotncheesy> FINALLY IM WATCHING THE LIVE I HAVE BEEN STUCK ON THE VODS FOR 3 HOURS
[6:11:01] <ThetaFive> I mean, it's classic Shmup / Castlevania
[6:11:03] <%IMDRanged> apatWink apatDab apatWhat
[6:11:06] <+seaearthandsky> has pat seen the leaked dmc5 footage?
[6:11:09] <+JustToWatch> lol he still hasn't completed his health bar
[6:11:10] <Tampaoster> get more health man
[6:11:17] <Stupidittty> Pat, go to sleep. You've already beaten the game.
[6:11:18] <%bazeljuice> Best time to heal on is on the lasers 3rd beam
[6:11:29] <Baconrath> does he get his power from Sunny D
[6:11:31] <element_of_loyalty> Only way ti win is quiting
[6:11:32] <ThetaFive> With the way he's facerolling I don't think 1 more pip of health is going to do much for him
[6:11:33] <grayjammer> Agreed
[6:11:33] <%TheImmortal70> The last upgrade to his health is literally locked behind the worst quest in the game
[6:11:37] <ivangood2> knight is easy for that reason
[6:11:39] <ape_hawk> BUT PAT THE SAME SHIT HAPPENS IN DARK SOULS
[6:11:41] <Tisaric> Yeah it kind of feels like they should've let you skip it at some point
[6:11:41] <knomad2b> this is way harder than the last Valkyrie
[6:11:43] <AncelDeLambert> AGREED
[6:11:47] <fillamar> @ThetaFive No, its undertale!!!
[6:11:53] <%TheImmortal70> This is definitely way harder than the last valk are you kidding
[6:11:53] <Fruitywhompus> He's just gotta learn the fight
[6:12:00] <TomerTop> @TheImmortal70 which is that? the flower one?
[6:12:01] <%TheImmortal70> You have a PARRY in GoW
[6:12:03] <$magikestral> i think they didn't know how to get you into the radiance boss fight without using the dreamnail
[6:12:03] <ryu1299> Yeah it's not great making it a 2 boss fight
[6:12:04] <aeonicvector> Kick this shits ass, and take a rest if you start to feel stuck, you can def defeath this
[6:12:06] <%Agami23> i dont like how this game makes hard bosses by giving them double damage.
[6:12:06] <+psycosis> @theimmortal70 yeah, that quest isn't worth it
[6:12:06] <Baconrath> dark souls is kinda tedious tho
[6:12:09] <%TheImmortal70> @TomerTop Yeah
[6:12:12] <hntronium> Git Gud x13
[6:12:14] <asbestosflavored> GIT GUD
[6:12:17] <grayjammer> @ape_hawk It does, and that's why Friede is the worst boss in DS3
[6:12:17] <$Kefbar> it is literally a dark souls boss just be patient
[6:12:18] <element_of_loyalty> STFU
[6:12:20] <%Kghaleon> For the Godmaster DLC you got to beat every boss in the game including NK Grim and THEN you get a chance at the final boss. <_< Yup. Sure.
[6:12:24] <%QueequegTheater> Sigrun isn't hard she just has a massive HP pool
[6:12:34] <Tisaric> Even just adding a ticker that disables that fight after a certain amount of times
[6:12:53] <+psycosis> @kghaleon there's the final boss, then the final FINAL boss
[6:13:04] <wunderkonig> @Kghaleon what else could you expect from a dlc called GodMaster?
[6:13:05] <ivangood2> @Kghaleon sweet sweet lore you're given is worth it
[6:13:08] <+G_Thunders> The HK fight isn’t any longer than a Souls boss run, so I didn’t mind getting maxed soul/health for radiance from it
[6:13:09] <Ell1ot> I just got here! Hello!
[6:13:12] <TomerTop> @TheImmortal70 i mean, its bad, but if you take the long path in the guides it just takes like 20 minutee with hardly any enemies
[6:13:21] <Tisaric> HE DO IT
[6:13:23] <Eresus> radiance has too much rng for my taste

[6:18:11] <Ell1ot> Pat beat the game? I JUST GOT HERE!
[6:18:13] <Nishi74> Pat if you're not going to do the DLC can you at least watch the new Godmaster ending?
[6:18:13] <legendarysabertooth> So Pat this is a lengthy game, what do you think it’s replay value is
[6:18:13] <%Sirculbs> Now... The OTHER ending is gotten through godmaster Pantheon.
[6:18:14] <Fruitywhompus> give yourself a big candy pat
[6:18:14] <+greenfall> Thoughts?
[6:18:14] <%Agami23> holy shit, this is worth like, 100 mighty number nines

[6:18:17] <+TeethMuncher> At last, god is dead
[6:18:17] <LtThunderbolt> Podcast story amiright
[6:18:18] <Rellim80> !uptime
[6:18:18] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 6h 18m 20s.
[6:18:20] <+TransporterX7> Manus the big hero good guy
[6:18:20] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat rub it in woolie's face during the podcast
[6:18:20] <%b0neh34d> You.... did itr
[6:18:20] <+Suplexsenpai> gj
[6:18:20] <Ultimatefool> If you thought that was hard, Godmaster will eat your ass
[6:18:21] <BakerBrute> @AngriestPat Tell Woolie to suck your dick
[6:18:23] <$rdark_ksu> man if that is pretty fuckling rad
[6:18:24] <8BitDsx> Hollow Knight spoilercast when!?
[6:18:24] <ekkieekk> though if you do play the DLCs on your own time you should totally do the finale of godmaster onstream
[6:18:24] <Tisaric> WOOLIE MUST KNOW HIS SINS
[6:18:26] <%skizzuto> Great job Pat!
[6:18:26] <element_of_loyalty> SIX HOURS
[6:18:26] <ShawnEXE> @AngriestPat I suggest youtubing the two godmaster endings
[6:18:27] <+m00nd0g1994> CHAOS LEGION TIME!!!
[6:18:27] <damienlunas> @AngriestPat Now that you're done, which is more Dark Souls? Hollow Knight or Dark Souls 2?
[6:18:27] <Stupidittty> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go get dreammy.
[6:18:28] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat big reccomendation, if you decide to stream the DLC, PLEASE mod and cheat for the funsies and lore
[6:18:28] <%ArcanumMBD> @hntronium fuck no, godmaster is great.
[6:18:30] <Innocuous_Goat> Steel soul mode lets go
[6:18:30] <millenniuss> Radiance in bestiary?
[6:18:31] <%Qdiddy533> Mossbag is the Vaati of HollowKnight
[6:18:33] <Pairoschuz> look at the journal, it has entries for Hollow Knight and Radiance
[6:18:33] <+Jaysky> I'm on the fourth godmaster trial and boy do I hate living
[6:18:34] <Tampaoster> RUB IT IN WOOLIE'S FACE
[6:18:34] <wrath1134> You did good dude!
[6:18:36] <Burpinator1> Now he has to go find the Mushroom dude
[6:18:37] <ThetaFive> How many tries was Radiance?
[6:18:37] <ryu1299> Yeah I haven't even finished godmaster yet because it's BULLSHIT
[6:18:37] <+GuelermeDias> look, if dark souls chat didn't ruin dark souls for pat it couldn't have possibly ruined hollow knight
[6:18:38] <TomerTop> So now you still have the secret bosses to go through, the soul versions of those bosses, zud, to finish the quests left and then do godmaster
[6:18:39] <+GabeSweetMan> Radiance is such a good boss.
[6:18:41] <resstarr> mossbag
[6:18:42] <cintra212> Mossbag is good
[6:18:43] <Tisaric> Mossbag is great
[6:18:43] <ChineseNininga> Woolie missed this
[6:18:44] <ekkieekk> and in the end Zote was the true heroes
[6:18:45] <Nishi74> Go Watch the new DLC ending!
[6:18:48] <ivangood2> there is like 2 LORE channels
[6:18:49] <resstarr> I don't think vaati has done anything ont his
[6:18:50] <cintra212> Hes a silly boi.
[6:18:52] <+에르샬레이튼> can we watch the lore video together?
[6:18:53] <ooblagis> I did Godmaster, and I pansied out from Path of Pain. Pat could do it.
[6:18:55] <%Sirculbs> @angriestpat Godmaster Pantheon is literally every boss plus some special ones you can't normally fight.
[6:18:56] <AtlasMcCoy> cause LORE
[6:18:56] <%Divryne> Lol did Woolie not fight the Radiance?
[6:18:57] <+th3madness> because it doesn't make them crazy
[6:18:58] <TomerTop> why do we? :^)
[6:18:58] <ekkieekk> it brainwashes them
[6:18:58] <%ArcanumMBD> The god forces its way into their mind
[6:18:58] <DivineDragoonKain> She didn't used to make them go crazy
[6:18:59] <+Fenlig> cos hes rad!
[6:18:59] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat The radiance came first and made moths
[6:18:59] <Endocrom> Moths to the flame
[6:18:59] <KatabolicRage> because it's a moth of light I guess
[6:19:00] <+reluctant_monkey> HMMMMMMMMM
[6:19:00] <+DustyGreen64> Because they went crazy
[6:19:00] <+luftraumm1> ask yarnamites that
[6:19:01] <+th3madness> it makes them beasts
[6:19:01] <+Roundelay11> The dont?
[6:19:02] <ShawnEXE> They don't worship the god, the god infects them
[6:19:02] <element_of_loyalty> Switch screens for ELMO
[6:19:02] <%Tredecian> they go crazy then start worship
[6:19:02] <cerberuscarmine> they dont
[6:19:02] <ape_hawk> why do WE worship gods?!?!?
[6:19:02] <+velemi> They don't, not anymore
[6:19:03] <@StridentSong> It's a parasite
[6:19:03] <+TransporterX7> They beat up god
[6:19:04] <%Minorou> You know how moths like light?
[6:19:04] <epylepticpanda> FOR POWER
[6:19:04] <$Piemono> It's hip with the kids
[6:19:04] <%skizzuto> because that god created them
[6:19:04] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat It was their default state.
[6:19:05] <%superc37> cuz god
[6:19:05] <ooblagis> she didn't
[6:19:06] <brian_hub> cause stupid
[6:19:06] <aeonicvector> Moths to a flame
[6:19:06] <cerberuscarmine> she forces them to
[6:19:07] <Donchalant402> they DONT worship it, thats why its crazy
[6:19:08] <+th3madness> the pale king bought sentience
[6:19:08] <DivineDragoonKain> but because the Pale King made everyone forget her, she invaded their dreams
[6:19:09] <$magikestral> @angriestpat the radiance is the original god of bugs, who is the prime drive of hivemind. The pale king appeared and preferred individuality, so he destroyed all statues of her with help of the moths. Unfortunately, she still exists, so that's why the infection happens.
[6:19:09] <%thunderborn32> watch it on stream
[6:19:09] <+Bouerd> They stopped worshiping it, that was the problem
[6:19:10] <scrumdrew> mossbag and superforge are your guys
[6:19:10] <+cirdrag> because its shiny
[6:19:10] <+luftraumm1> eyes on the inside and all that
[6:19:10] <element_of_loyalty> GIMME ELMO
[6:19:10] <+GuelermeDias> did pat do colosseum
[6:19:10] <+seaearthandsky> hey pat, have you seen the dmc leaks?
[6:19:11] <WaffleLeech> God made them go crazy because they STOPPED worshiping
[6:19:12] <+GuelermeDias> so much shit
[6:19:14] <legendarysabertooth> The light is a forgotten deity that’s mad it got forgotten
[6:19:14] <+Jaysky> They used to worship The Radiance, then the Pale King convinced them to turn against the Radiance.
[6:19:14] <@SSaryn> Big Biocurse Parasite THing
[6:19:14] <Zanicedg> Hive mind does not equal crazy.
[6:19:14] <Coystick> Moths be dum
[6:19:14] <@StridentSong> It forces them to worship it
[6:19:14] <+discodemolition> Only the moths did
[6:19:14] <+Roundelay11> They don't worship The Radiance
[6:19:16] <+TransporterX7> They had one but they beat her up and sealed her
[6:19:16] <fillamar> She forces a hivemind
[6:19:16] <Pairoschuz> the lore at 2400 essence gives you a little more info
[6:19:16] <pshuuu> they worship a the king who made them smart and civilized
[6:19:17] <%Qdiddy533> All Gods desire is to be remembered
[6:19:17] <element_of_loyalty> ELMO
[6:19:18] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Radiance visits their dreams and makes them go psycho and get infected
[6:19:19] <ooblagis> She used to be a normal good
[6:19:19] <AncelDeLambert> Because GODS Pat
[6:19:20] <ShawnEXE> THEY USED TO WORSHIP THE GOD AND THEN THEY WORSHIP THE KING INSTEAD
[6:19:21] <$RaikenTB> Perhaps the same could be said of all religions.
[6:19:22] <OhioNitsud> worshipping a god that makes you go crazy? hmmmm, why would anyone do that? Kappa
[6:19:22] <+Roundelay11> It's just trying to infect them
[6:19:26] <ivangood2> He makes em crazy cos it was sealed
[6:19:28] <%Rostichenburg> Didn’t go crazy until after the king usurped
[6:19:33] <+G_Thunders> Because bugs mindlessly go toward light in the dark
[6:19:35] <grayjammer> Because the Crazy Problem started after they stopped worshipping
[6:19:36] <ChineseNininga> Black god came, moth god jealous, moth god made bio curse
[6:19:37] <RedMaskBandit> Literally cause they dont know
[6:19:44] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat It made them go crazy because it got fuckin pissed when it got sealed tldr
[6:19:46] <fillamar> He trapped her in a dream
[6:19:47] <TomerTop> god gave them sentient, before then they were just bugs. but as they became sentient they elected their own king, which radiance didn't like so it starts infecting people and making them psycho
[6:19:48] <+th3madness> oh yeah they sealed the radiance in the realm of dreams
[6:19:53] <dandyspider> she was there before wyrm/king gave them free will
[6:19:56] <+th3madness> but it could still fuck you
[6:19:57] <Tampaoster> BIO CURSE
[6:19:58] <element_of_loyalty> The Queen Reigns
[6:20:00] <%Tredecian> shes an old god that has to be saeled and be forgotton but the warden sprung a leak
[6:20:00] <ryu1299> dream biocurse if you will
[6:20:00] <ShawnEXE> Moth loves light
[6:20:02] <Hydrapissed> Everytime u nailed a infected they would say BRIGHT
[6:20:05] <dagreenpillow> The Radiance be like, you don't want me so here ya gooo
[6:20:07] <DivineDragoonKain> 2400 essence gets you the end of the moth lady's quest
[6:20:09] <ThetaFive> What a good-ass video game, damn
[6:20:10] <%Qdiddy533> Radiance did not want to be forgotten
[6:20:10] <+th3madness> so the pale king came up with hollow knight
[6:20:10] <ivangood2> maoths are creations of Radiance
[6:20:13] <ekkieekk> you get a bit of lore if you get 2400 essense and talk to the moth again
[6:20:16] <Rada150> supposedly there are other gods but the moth god brought sentience and intelligence
[6:20:16] <ChineseNininga> Moth god made bio curse cause no one remembers moth god
[6:20:20] <Nishi74> Go Watch the new DLC endings Pat!

[6:20:20] <Theoyveyman> !uptime
[6:20:20] <%Kghaleon> Now play Steel soul mode.
[6:20:20] <DonatelloJose> @AngriestPat Plague is streaming Nioh if you want to raid him when you're done.
[6:20:21] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 6h 20m 22s.
[6:20:21] <Tampaoster> CAUSE ARTORIAS MAN
[6:20:22] <%TheImmortal70> The moths along with the King of Hollownest sealed the Radiance in dreams and purged all reference, but eventually for some reason, it came back from the dreams through intrigue and influence
[6:20:24] <Veluren> The extra mutations were just her petty way of going "fuck you" to the bugs for forgetting she existed originally
[6:20:25] <+TeethMuncher> Free will is bad. Amirite guys?
[6:20:26] <$magikestral> when you are under the spell of the radiance, you do not think, you only act.
[6:20:26] <Daniel_Is_I> @AngriestPat Basically the Wyrm came crashing down and the Pale King was born and he convinced the moths to seal their old god away in the dream by "forgetting" her.
[6:20:26] <AtlasMcCoy> CONGRATULATIONS
[6:20:26] <Zanicedg> @AngriestPat What'd you think of Hollow Knight?
[6:20:27] <+Birdigalore> Thank You For Playing~

[6:20:43] <%Minorou> I don't know, the game seems a little buggy.
[6:20:44] <custoadian> so, are the mantises not infected because they weren't part of Hallownest, and so the Radiance didn't target them?

[6:20:52] <Virhauk> woah

[6:20:54] <AncelDeLambert> WAY TOO LONG
[6:20:54] <LtThunderbolt> you wont THO

[6:20:57] <+AXL808> 102% complete?
[6:20:57] <kimo313> How does Hollow knight compare to souls games?
[6:20:57] <%ltdogg707> wow im surprised pat is still on
[6:20:58] <%Divryne> BLACK EVIL.
[6:20:58] <%Dimfish> this games fucking great
[6:21:00] <AlasterAngelo> ehhhhhh
[6:21:02] <ThetaFive> Buy the game just for the soundtrack if nothing else
[6:21:02] <element_of_loyalty> FUCK NO
[6:21:04] <epylepticpanda> The Hollow Knight and the protagonist are derived of the void which is the opposite the light
[6:21:04] <+discodemolition> Wow
[6:21:06] <reonome> wow
[6:21:07] <LtThunderbolt> take that back pat
[6:21:08] <wired_soul> uh
[6:21:11] <Pairoschuz> You can quick check the hunter's journal if you want, for a bit more lore
[6:21:12] <burna_lova> That's a bold statement, but not one that I necessarily disagree with.
[6:21:12] <DonatelloJose> What an accomplishment for a game
[6:21:13] <ThetaFive> Just buy it, spend the money
[6:21:15] <ooblagis> What about Dark Souls?
[6:21:16] <DivineDragoonKain> You can change title screen under Extras
[6:21:16] <%Tredecian> black good
[6:21:16] <legendarysabertooth> Replay value?
[6:21:19] <DivineDragoonKain> among those you unlock
[6:21:19] <BakerBrute> @AngriestPat You can change the title screen in the extras menu\
[6:21:20] <ekkieekk> Theres a special title screen you get in godmaster that has zote singing the theme
[6:21:20] <Coystick> SOTN is garb by comparison
[6:21:20] <%ltdogg707> i agree pat
[6:21:21] <+th3madness> hollow knight has mega good lore
[6:21:22] <Virhauk> eternal ordeal title screen
[6:21:23] <Virhauk> though
[6:21:25] <$magikestral> it's my favorite in comparison
[6:21:26] <+TransporterX7> Ya did good Pat
[6:21:27] <+GuelermeDias> hollow knight is AMAZINGLY GOOD and it's also WAY TOO CHEAP FOR HOW GOOD IT IS
[6:21:27] <%mattmanj17> @AngriestPat DONATION
[6:21:29] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat How'd it feel to just eat the Radiance?
[6:21:29] <Tampaoster> open your acheivements
[6:21:29] <Tisaric> AND IT'S ONLY FUCKING 15 DOLLARS FOR FUCKS SAKE
[6:21:30] <+TransporterX7> Ya did good
[6:21:30] <%Divryne> WOOLIE WILL NEVER GET THE BLACK EVIL TITLESCREEN. LUL
[6:21:31] <+GuelermeDias> like holy fuck
[6:21:31] <%Qdiddy533> THIS WAS 15 DOLLARS
[6:21:31] <+GabeSweetMan> SOTN is over 20 years old guys
[6:21:33] <+Bouerd> Eternal ordeal title screen is best LUL
[6:21:33] <+에르샬레이튼> can we watch the lore video together?
[6:21:34] <CptJackySparra> I used to be addicted to Hollow Knight. Such an incredible platformer
[6:21:34] <+rooked4> Holy shit, I went on a date when you first fought the Hollw Knight .... cant believe I got back with the Radiance dead
[6:21:34] <brian_hub> Kreygasm ooooooh
[6:21:35] <%Rostichenburg> Now do steel soul
[6:21:35] <aeonicvector> Yup! And like i reccomended earlier, fi your goign to DLC, either take some time and or Mod your game to make ti easier, it can be rough

[6:21:40] <$magikestral> there is one more title screen, but its a secret
[6:21:40] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Pat, look up the Eternal Ordeal menu screen
[6:21:40] <bloodypurpledog> Now the HOLLOW is CHONKY

[6:21:57] <Donchalant402> @AngriestPat you might want to look up the ending because actually getting it is TOO HARDCORE for the VAST MAJORITY of people to get
[6:21:57] <Stupidittty> Path of pain sucks.

[6:22:01] <+GabeSweetMan> Oh man I missed Path of Pain???!
[6:22:01] <OmnipotentTrevor> What I don't get is, where the main character came from at the beginning of the game. Why was he out of town, and why did he come back now?

[6:23:20] <Pairoschuz> Did you seal away Elmo in the abyss by mistake?
[6:23:21] <LtThunderbolt> thats a puppet
[6:23:21] <General_Terro> he ded
[6:23:22] <OhioNitsud> dick punch hurt
[6:23:23] <ShawnEXE> ELMO IS INFECTED WITH THE LIGHT
[6:23:24] <%spacekataz18> OH NO PAT IS PUPPETEERING THE DEAD BODY
[6:23:25] <ThetaFive> It's a trick
[6:23:25] <%DavidSanChan> look at that stand in cat
[6:23:26] <fillamar> ELMO CORPSE
[6:23:26] <%spacekataz18> HOW HORRIBLE
[6:23:26] <+luftraumm1> tell me someone clipped that
[6:23:28] <%SmolBluGhost> THE BABY IS SAFE
[6:23:30] <ThetaFive> Elmo confirmed for Radiance
[6:23:30] <%skizzuto> apatWink apatWink apatWink
[6:23:30] <Darksword64> HOLDING THE CORPSE
[6:23:32] <DuskPixie> THE BABY
[6:23:33] <aeonicvector> Elmo got the radiance
[6:23:33] <+NWR_James> PAT KILLED ELMO AND IS WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S IT
[6:23:35] <PumaOfDarkness> He could still be dead.
[6:23:35] <%Press_X_ToJASON> apatBlep apatWink apatElmo apatPorgmo
[6:23:35] <scrumdrew> @AngriestPat i would recommend looking up that godmaster ending if your not gonna do it. also its some of the hardest shit ever like jesus fuck
[6:23:38] <%TheImmortal70> LUL
[6:23:38] <ape_hawk> NO WAY, HE'S WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S-ING ELMO
[6:23:39] <legendarysabertooth> He better be boi
[6:23:39] <ekkieekk> elmo is a bag of jello now
[6:23:40] <mistspade> Paige is goig to kil you
[6:23:41] <element_of_loyalty> Elmo's pecka hurts
[6:23:47] <%TheImmortal70> God, bless this mess of a cat
[6:23:57] <+skylerpilot> @AngriestPat Valdis Story is another great metroidvania and doesn't get any recognition. Its way more action combat focused with launchers, air combos, dodge cancels and parries. Also has 4 playable characters
[6:23:58] <Ell1ot> why no Yakuzee?
[6:24:04] <ThetaFive> Is Elmo drugged up from his PENIS PROBLEM?
[6:24:05] <LtThunderbolt> WHat a about a Sonic 3 LP
[6:24:10] <%AbnormalVoid> NotLikeThis
[6:24:10] <Feels_Pat_Man> @AngriestPat Pat what about the super secret ending
[6:24:14] <@SSaryn> SEGA of America is cool.
[6:24:15] <epylepticpanda> SHENMUE REMASTER LP
[6:24:15] <element_of_loyalty> PA5
[6:24:19] <@SSaryn> SEGA of Japan is not.
[6:24:23] <+TehBeerBaron> What's going on with SEGA?
[6:24:26] <%HiroTSK5> @AngriestPat Maybe just do the Majima stuff from Twowami.
[6:24:32] <@SSaryn> Much like ATLUS.
[6:24:45] <$magikestral> cheer232 Congrats to beating hollow knight, I'm so glad you got to do so much on stream. Whenever you decide to do Godmaster, I only repeat what Hornet said as she stabbed the Hollow Knight: "Git Gud!"
[6:24:46] <DonatelloJose> SEGA terroized youtubers with strikes.
[6:24:51] <Tisaric> mossbag
[6:24:54] <AtlasMcCoy> LORE
[6:24:54] <+TehBeerBaron> Oof, of course they did

[6:25:09] <wired_soul> sega shitheads wont bring phantasy star 2 online to na i hate them PunOko
[6:25:11] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> He also fucked a tree and then a spider in the meantime
[6:25:16] <%Press_X_ToJASON> apatBig pushy
[6:25:19] <%vobent> apatCrazyhead
[6:25:20] <%spacekataz18> I no pushy
[6:25:21] <zal_silverfang> SPITE GO UP
[6:25:21] <+G_Thunders> He killed her with buzzsaws probably
[6:25:22] <KatabolicRage> the spider was part of a deal man
[6:25:22] <BakerBrute> I LOVE YOU PAT
[6:25:23] <grayjammer> BACKSEATS BACK ALRIGHT
[6:25:24] <%skizzuto> apatBig FUN
[6:25:25] <Tisaric> IT'S SO GOOD
[6:25:25] <+TeethMuncher> It was alright :-)
[6:25:26] <%Kghaleon> Ban all of chat.
[6:25:26] <fillamar> Push from love
[6:25:28] <Pairoschuz> super great game super great stream
[6:25:29] <Tampaoster> BIG PUSH BIG FUN
[6:25:29] <element_of_loyalty> @AngriestPat GET GOING ON THE PORTAL 2 CO OP
[6:25:30] <+luftraumm1> ppl get pushy when they love a game like this
[6:25:30] <@SSaryn> I'm tempted to ban you all. Including myself! But boi this was a good strem game.
[6:25:31] <CrypticMochi> Big dick energy all over Woolie!
[6:25:32] <CryptCreep> it was a great run!
[6:25:38] <ZaibatsuFan> You are too pure for this worl....well you're alright.
[6:25:39] <Stupidittty> Kimari likes a good push.
[6:25:41] <BakerBrute> Fuck Chat, Love Pat
[6:25:45] <%SmolBluGhost> 10/10 Huge Completion
[6:25:45] <Aldsan> Go tell Woolie how much he missed on the Podcast now.
[6:25:59] <Tisaric> Yeah bitch out Woolie on the podcast please
[6:26:00] <+th3madness> nope
[6:26:01] <+TeethMuncher> Godmaster is pretty fucked
[6:26:02] <+th3madness> just bosses
[6:26:04] <ekkieekk> godmaster is fucking so hard
[6:26:08] <flavonoskovitch> i think theres a skunk behind you watch out
[6:26:09] <%TheImmortal70> @SSaryn I mean purging the chat of everything is pretty accurate with the theme of OBLIVION
[6:26:12] <$magikestral> 5th pantheon is bullshit, the rest are just hard as fuck
[6:26:12] <+JustToWatch> it was great, people got pushy, but that's probably because they care. or are assholes
[6:26:14] <ooblagis> took me like 30 hours
[6:26:20] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Godmaster rewards being stubborn and learning patterns. It's a bit time consuming but a ton of fun and you'll do great at it
[6:26:20] <pshuuu> the hive was a zone, right? was it in the base game?
[6:26:21] <%lutefiiisk> The Hornet DLC(probably paid) will have new zones
[6:26:22] <AtlasMcCoy> I think they're saving all the manpower for the Hornet stuff
[6:26:23] <%Kghaleon> It's not impossibly hard until toward the end, there's like 7 new bosses
[6:26:23] <fillamar> Realize that woolie didn't fight the radiance or white palace
[6:26:25] <+th3madness> I only scream shit because I care
[6:26:26] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It doesn't matter if she put it as her part of a deal, that king super fucked a big spider lady
[6:26:27] <zal_silverfang> feels like something they would save for a possible followup to the world
[6:26:29] <element_of_loyalty> BE cause you touch yourself
[6:26:30] <%TheImmortal70> HORNET DLC CONFIRMED FREE
[6:26:31] <%Dimfish> there is a zone for godmaster, but its an arena style zone
[6:26:36] <aeonicvector> <3 Ya, sorry we were pushy, and seriously love how ya TROUNCED two of the HARDEST things in the game pre-bossrush
[6:26:37] <ooblagis> of just hanging my head against wall after wall
[6:26:38] <SatansDick1> hornet dlc will prob have new zones
[6:26:38] <Tisaric> I'm so fucking hyped for Hornet DLC
[6:26:43] <ShawnEXE> the 4 pantheons are cool and the new bosses introduced are so fucking good
[6:26:45] <%skizzuto> the hive was in base game but hive knight was not
[6:26:49] <ekkieekk> theres also a hidden superboss in godmaster that's a wave battle
[6:26:49] <grayjammer> I'm inclined to agree
[6:26:51] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Get ready to blow up Woolie on the podcast.
[6:26:52] <+TeethMuncher> But exploring means a lot of new assets
[6:26:53] <$magikestral> @angriestpat remember, they're a 2-3 person team: they can only do so much for free
[6:27:00] <element_of_loyalty> Sloucher
[6:27:00] <Stupidittty> Even mic is tired.
[6:27:02] <Feels_Pat_Man> SQUISHEN The Elmo
[6:27:03] <%lutefiiisk> WOolie blown the fuck out!
[6:27:05] <nepwar> Did he do it chat?
[6:27:07] <@StridentSong> OFF-BRAND COKE ON STREAM. RED BULL SPONSORSHIP CANCELED
[6:27:14] <+th3madness> can you believe team cherry made this shit for 50k
[6:27:17] <%TheImmortal70> I HIGHLY doubt they're still just a 2-3 person team
[6:27:23] <+th3madness> makes inafune look like a hack
[6:27:27] <$magikestral> godmaster has a fuckton of new assets, its not my fave dlc but i appreciate all they did
[6:27:37] <%ArcanumMBD> USE SOUND
[6:27:39] <$magikestral> @theimmortal70 nope, still is, they want to stay small
[6:27:39] <@SSaryn> Strident, new homework, Daps emote and now an off-brand coke Emote.
