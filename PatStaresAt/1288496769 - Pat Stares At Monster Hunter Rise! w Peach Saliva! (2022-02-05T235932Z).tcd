[0:16:04] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I'm ahead of you at this point
[0:16:04] <%Sotetsu> I got to the point in Rise where it seems super repetitive, and I slowed down.
[0:16:04] <%SaiyanShoto> Did you ever get the sonic drip for your Hunter?
[0:16:11] <%Dakuu75> I'm getting tired of Rise. I honestly just want gear with more gem slots

[0:18:20] <%dekkitout> @owensleftfoot What's the thesis with a claim like that?
[0:18:28] <Pookiedaexzile> I wanna know they felt my hitussy
[0:18:29] <@Ranryu692> I bought Black Desert on sale for $3 just to check out the character creator
[0:18:35] <%Dakuu75> That's sad, who would do that dumb shit... (loading shaders)
[0:18:41] <%TerpanderLux> i never did that.

[0:19:03] <Cosairen> yeah its the hammer slide beat
[0:19:04] <%SvenHolgersson> Yes
[0:19:05] <T_Sasquatch> @Pookiedaexzile when yyou have the potential of atleast 4 players hitting the same enemy its just dumb to look at
[0:19:10] <%SvenHolgersson> Unless they fucked it
[0:19:11] <someslytherin> happy weekend all
[0:19:12] <%owensleftfoot> @owensleftfoot nothing, it's basically some disgruntled MH vet rambling about how much better the old games, namely Dos, were
[0:19:17] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I was late into using them
[0:19:18] <Cosairen> you also get the hammer parry
[0:19:24] <%cherryburnout> black desert is bad cause they deleted all their characters like a year ago
[0:19:24] <Mattais88> thought it was 5?
[0:19:26] <%valriot> Its based on weapons crafted, and yeah courage style i shite
[0:19:27] <%KodoqueG> yo thanks LobsterPriest
[0:19:35] <%dekkitout> Have her make all the sleepy hammers
[0:19:36] <%DashXero> You can make 3 and upgrade eight times.
[0:19:37] <%ChrisPlaysThing> So i just use that one big swing

[0:19:43] <%kyh9> MATH

[0:20:39] <EynoStiles> Its free to think about thou
[0:20:40] <Pookiedaexzile> That Crytussy is not hot
[0:20:40] <%ChrisPlaysThing> But it's REALLY useful!
[0:20:42] <Ardailec> Just swap the NFT pic with a potato
[0:20:43] <someslytherin> aww pat ruining the fun with his no moida
[0:20:43] <%Taisuru> Can I have a LITTLE murder? As a snack?
[0:20:44] <Cryomancer_Maurice> no
[0:20:45] <koffeemancer> what about hitler tho
[0:20:55] <+AWr00tBear> The super armor dash replaces the Sonic spin attack. It might be better but the spin is more fun.
[0:20:58] <%Bt_Robot> Murder is never worth it.
[0:21:09] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Can i perform 1 genocide? As a treat?
[0:21:12] <fairore> booo
[0:21:14] <@Ranryu692> does Interrupt work on anything?
[0:21:19] <%Bt_Robot> Unless you love prison
[0:21:20] <Pookiedaexzile> But does it feel like DMC 5 Multiplayer
[0:22:01] <+McSoliace> what if your about to be murdered is murder still bad
[0:22:05] <%cooldude69xx> Stun is too all or nothing by definition
[0:22:08] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Bosses don't like hit stun
[0:22:26] <@Ranryu692> okay, that's good to know
[0:22:30] <@Ranryu692> ty
[0:22:33] <Cosairen> true bravery never gets interjected
[0:22:37] <%Treuan> Ram's Voice in World of Darkness
[0:22:41] <$bnuuy0> Paige enjoying BIG BONK?
[0:22:42] <%Taisuru> They should make interrupts work on everything with a cast bar for like a week for laughs
[0:22:53] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah, Cops aint Punk
[0:23:00] <%Dakuu75> 6 years wasn't enough "breathing room"
[0:23:00] <+polothegreatest> if only
[0:23:01] <%dekkitout> That cyberpsycho questlline has me SO PISSED
[0:23:02] <%Monkeyweed21> shoutout to Godfall which had to edit hitstun into its trailers
[0:23:02] <%valriot> Ive heard Cyberpunk is really good, just fucked
[0:23:03] <%kyh9> Cyberpunk is very middle of the road
[0:23:05] <Profmcstevie> I've seen the gunplay in cyberpunk, shut up
[0:23:05] <T_Sasquatch> ?
[0:23:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Cops aint Cyberpunk
[0:23:13] <%kyh9> Like, it's unfair, but I really needed Cyberpunk to break the mold more
[0:23:14] <+upandadam> they went down the wrong path with that one
[0:23:14] <%SaiyanShoto> I’m still upset it’s first person
[0:23:16] <T_Sasquatch> i dont believe that at all
[0:23:19] <%G_Thunders> It’s incredibly mediocre even if it wasn’t filled with bugs
[0:23:25] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Be nice chat
[0:23:25] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Man, I wish Wildstar hadn't needed to be rebuilt 3 times before release. That was the first game I ever worked on.
[0:23:30] <+polothegreatest> kojima took what 10years for mgs5?
[0:23:32] <iacus_> came out in 2020
[0:23:33] <%TheHateFish> @valriot This is correct. Also, they should've had Keanu play Morgan Blackhand instead of Johnny Silverhand
[0:23:34] <%dekkitout> Like dammit- why wasn't the game 60% os what that lizzy wizzy quest was
[0:23:45] <%owensleftfoot> their mistake was trying to make it for ps4 and xbone
[0:23:49] <%Monkeyweed21> it came out in 2020
[0:23:51] <T_Sasquatch> i watched that tim rogers cyberpunk vid in totality , no way
[0:23:56] <%Taisuru> @ChrisPlaysThing For what it's worth I thought Wildstar was pretty neat.
[0:23:59] <iacus_> it's not
[0:24:04] <%ChrisPlaysThing> BOY HAS IT
[0:24:09] <%FingaLights> Technically
[0:24:10] <%valriot> To be fair, they "announced" it in 2021, doesnt mean they started it
[0:24:13] <%Monkeyweed21> WELCOME TO THE ABYSS
[0:24:16] <@Spydurman> if they had actually been working on it for 8 years it might have been godlike LUL
[0:24:20] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> They probs had to restart a couple times
[0:24:22] <$scallycap> @ChrisPlaysThing Wildstar was fucking awesome. thanks broski
[0:24:23] <%IvanMistwalker> yeah
[0:24:26] <Cosairen> its was in pre production hell for 6 years
[0:24:26] <iacus_> it was in development for less than 5 years. It needed more
[0:24:28] <@Ranryu692> Paige mentioned on her stream yesterday that 2019 was 3 years ago and I almost cried
[0:24:28] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @Taisuru It was! But it has some really serious issues
[0:24:31] <T_Sasquatch> 2020-2021 doesnt exist to me
[0:24:33] <+jacksawjack> DNF all over again
[0:24:35] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[0:24:36] <%valriot> LUL No i agree
[0:24:46] <%D00msDayDan> if you weren't working on it for 5 years don't say you worked on it for 5 years
[0:24:48] <%kyh9> They shouldn't have announced it if it wasn't close to release
[0:24:50] <%valriot> Dont announce something till its out in 6 months
[0:24:54] <@Spydurman> it's been 2019 for 3 years
[0:24:57] <%Monkeyweed21> The lead devs were always going to waste all but the last 2 years of dev time restarting over and over
[0:24:59] <Pookiedaexzile> "Good Movie Bad movie, No one care" Jackie Chan
[0:24:59] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @scallycap no problem! I wish it had survived
[0:24:59] <%kyh9> Like, I don't want to know about games unless they're within 12 months of release
[0:25:00] <iacus_> because gamers = dumb
[0:25:02] <%SuckerPunchSyd> What are we not caring about?
[0:25:06] <Latija> it should not come out
[0:25:06] <%dekkitout> 💯
[0:25:07] <Profmcstevie> You go public? timers on
[0:25:08] <T_Sasquatch> @valriot but investorrrsss
[0:25:09] <+Etherealizer> I think they only announced Cyberpunk that early so they could hire, IIRC
[0:25:09] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Bayonetta 3 better be the fucking best thing ever then
[0:25:12] <%FingaLights> That was a dumb
[0:25:13] <%kyh9> AGREED
[0:25:16] <%Agami23> final fantasy versus 13
[0:25:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Skyrim 2
[0:25:18] <fairore> yeah
[0:25:20] <+polothegreatest> metroid prime 4
[0:25:21] <%Treuan> People are going to expect a working engine with that kind of time investment damn gottem
[0:25:22] <%maubpp> bayo 3 should not have been announced when it was
[0:25:22] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Yeah fair
[0:25:25] <%shurtal> announcements are for shareholders, unfortunately.
[0:25:27] <T_Sasquatch> you need to attract the investorrrss
[0:25:27] <%dekkitout> I am going to be so unfair to TES6 because of the lack of mods
[0:25:28] <%kyh9> 5 years I think
[0:25:30] <Latija> oh no it sucks
[0:25:30] <+Jack8274> 11 more years of Skyrim
[0:25:31] <+2DSuperiority> How about that Overwatch 2 and Diablo Immortal
[0:25:31] <DianaTheAscian> oh that game is noy comming out for awhile
[0:25:33] <%owensleftfoot> NEVER announce your game before you've even started fucking development on it
[0:25:35] <%TerpanderLux> it SUCKS
[0:25:37] <+Shadic790> It was like that for me with FF13 versus
[0:25:41] <%karovus> I was 13 when skyrim came out and now I have a college degree and a full time job
[0:25:41] <GrahamBaxter> I straight-up don't want to hear about a game unless it's WITHIN one year of release. Ideally, 6 months.
[0:25:43] <DianaTheAscian> not*
[0:25:44] <Pookiedaexzile> Vikings Again
[0:25:46] <+Jack8274> They'd still buy it in droves tho
[0:25:46] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Imagine if dread sucked LUL LUL
[0:25:46] <%emperordread> Videogames
[0:25:47] <%Wynzler> TES6 is going to be as bad as FFXVI will be
[0:25:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Womp Womp
[0:25:48] <%strakillias> And the instant you delay it once, just delay it until it is good. No excuse for that release
[0:25:49] <NephiStreams> @PatStaresAt literally how i felt with Kingdom Hearts 3
[0:25:49] <%Agami23> remember how people said FF15 didnt have the time in development it needed?
[0:25:50] <Latija> for tes 6 bethesda has removed stats
[0:25:52] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I watched Reboot reruns and though they were new kind of poor as a kid
[0:25:56] <%Bt_Robot> We're gonna get ESO High Rock before ES6
[0:25:59] <nickynack_> i had to explain this to my sister about GTA 6
[0:26:01] <%Monkeyweed21> @2DSuperiority dont you mean Diablo 4 or is the phone game ALSO in dev hell?
[0:26:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Oops We did Nords twice
[0:26:05] <T_Sasquatch> personally i dont want to even know about a game existence until its about to release a month later
[0:26:05] <Latija> who even cares about starfield
[0:26:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> Garfield
[0:26:07] <%TerpanderLux> i am the ceo of bethesda
[0:26:09] <@Ranryu692> remember, Starfield rhymes with Garfield
[0:26:11] <%shurtal> I odn't think thatconversation is gonna happen Pat
[0:26:14] <%dekkitout> Creation Engine 2 babyyyyyy
[0:26:15] <%FingaLights> Oh is that a thing? Is that coming out at all?
[0:26:18] <%JoshManVGH> At least Ghostwire Tokyo got a gameplay reveal!
[0:26:21] <koffeemancer> maybe that obsidian game will be good
[0:26:21] <+polothegreatest> if dread sucked, samus would live with captain falcon
[0:26:21] <%valriot> Apparently its going well no?
[0:26:23] <Profmcstevie> Hi it's me Todd......we will not be talking to Pat
[0:26:25] <Psyramics> things like TES 6 are a given tho, like, there's probably gonna be a Falliout 5, and a Persona 6, and new Mario game
[0:26:27] <%Vextalyst> I still think even another yeah would've helped the game's perception @PatStaresAt
[0:26:38] <iacus_> will starfield finally get windows in interiors? nah
[0:26:48] <%strakillias> Starfield is gonna come out and feel just like the Outer Worlds. Like not great but okish
[0:26:50] <+2DSuperiority> @monkeyweed21 I mean the mobile game that still isn't out yet after years yeah
[0:26:56] <%Vextalyst> but I do agree that is hard to care about
[0:27:09] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[0:27:17] <+blacksoap65> Glad Pat beard is coming in
[0:27:19] <+Etherealizer> I used to love Bethesda games but they continue to just make me more bitter and more angry as the years move on lol
[0:27:28] <%cherryburnout> are you gonna stream Strangers of Paradise?
[0:27:31] <%SvenHolgersson> GOTY Cyberpunk
[0:27:33] <iacus_> apparently Cyberpunk is fucking great
[0:27:35] <Cryomancer_Maurice> Pee pole?
[0:27:38] <%G_Thunders> You could tell in that 40 minutes gameplay trailer it was trying to be way too many things at the same time
[0:27:39] <%IvanMistwalker> Starfield is going to crash and burn
[0:27:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> is this video games?
[0:27:49] <+envy1499> Elden ring not poop tho right?
[0:27:49] <%TerpanderLux> yes
[0:27:50] <%SvenHolgersson> yes

[1:12:59] <Cryomancer_Maurice> The devil told the truth its just the truth you don't like.

[1:13:03] <%cade_calrayn> if Pat wasn't there you'd still be lost in Japan to this day, Paige
[1:13:04] <+CAPSLOCKlive> It really looks like it has 2 Poison tits
[1:13:05] <%cade_calrayn> Don't lie
[1:13:12] <GhostlySkunk> @PatStaresAt Is this better than Monster Hunter World??
[1:13:13] <+rdark_ksu> The Japanese Train story where Paige shit talked some Japanese children and Pat knew she was the one?
[1:13:19] <$dmdyne99> Wait, is this about how Paige kept taking the first train she saw

[1:14:12] <DancesWitBalrog> UHM
[1:14:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> typical North Americans, confused by properly functioning public transit

[1:14:33] <%Taisuru> "Haha look at this idiot"
[1:14:34] <%Wynzler> Paige ahegao confirmed when no one wanted it
[1:14:34] <%Jhylla81> Technically trains run on tracks not streets so its okay not to be street smart Kappa
[1:14:37] <sheepysenka> I'm gonna try to keep a straight face while I'm doing the dirty as a challenge

[1:15:30] <+rdark_ksu> @GhostlySkunk Its also been my experience when someone is using a language they don't believe another speaks and gets called out, the surprise is never small
[1:15:31] <+CAPSLOCKlive> It looks different when you look down and it's a Muk instead of a Gardevoir
[1:15:34] <grimsbenis> "The Implication"
[1:15:34] <DancesWitBalrog> Plague vid??
[1:15:41] <%cade_calrayn> PLUSSY OF GRUSSY NO
[1:15:44] <fairore> yeah i did see

[1:15:52] <tanarath> @patstaresat you can cancel aiming to slide up too
[1:15:53] <sheepysenka> that's a gun gun, pat
[1:15:58] <GhostlySkunk> @rdark_ksu Nice. I assume everyone can understand everything at any time.
[1:16:05] <Kex173> do all weapons have unique models now? no more bone weapons with a tiny piece of the monster on them?
[1:16:07] <GhostlySkunk> Ah PLAGUE!
[1:16:12] <GhostlySkunk> Never heard his voice before.
[1:16:16] <Cosairen> YES
[1:16:16] <%DashXero> Yes.
[1:16:21] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Imagine a Vegan in the MH world
[1:16:27] <%DashXero> You can COOK animal tails.
[1:16:28] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "Dragon meat is yummy, and i really want it in my tummyyyy"
[1:16:29] <%Wynzler> I thought Plague's favorite food was Gardevoir
[1:16:33] <Radioactivetaco9> how much enegy do you think it takes to swing a sword bigger than yourself?
[1:16:36] <PhantonBat> @grimsbenis They would never say no, because of the implication
[1:16:38] <%Monkeyweed21> the average MH meal is like 3 or 4 thousand calories
[1:16:40] <%CptCreampuff16> thats why you get so few materials 90% goes to food
[1:16:43] <+AWr00tBear> They eat rocks
[1:16:50] <+rdark_ksu> @GhostlySkunk I've just always followed the adage of "better to be thought dumb, than to open ones mouth and confirm it"
[1:16:51] <Cosairen> i remember in freedom unite every meal is a full FEAST but for only one person
[1:16:52] <grimsbenis> @kex173 there's a few that are still like that but there's more unique ones in this
[1:16:56] <GiantRobort> Mhw has best canteen food
[1:16:59] <ahaegotrigger> Elis getting turned on
[1:16:59] <Darthkitten_Prime> I think it's more the hunters cause they wield the massive-ass weapons, climb sheer cliffs and facetank dragons.
[1:17:03] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Before picking up the goods of the Monster Pat needs to check if they are good enough
[1:17:03] <%SaiyanShoto> He wants to fuck it

[1:18:25] <fugly_nick> ANIMAL ABUSED
[1:18:29] <Pookiedaexzile> I would play an MMO if anything you hit had 1/10 of this reaction
[1:18:32] <$dmdyne99> What about a brother named the orphanator
[1:18:36] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Who shots the dog? Just to be a dick
[1:18:37] <%DovaDude29> That was a lag spike during the orphan maker joke. Dam
[1:18:39] <%Monkeyweed21> SHOOTS SURE
[1:18:40] <GhostlySkunk> @PatStaresAt Why are you a tree?
[1:18:41] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Don't forget to double tap
[1:18:43] <%TerpanderLux> yes
[1:18:48] <grimsbenis> no one should totally tell Eli that slicing is very funny in this game
[1:18:52] <SolumFuturae> What's the difference between an orphan and an escaped inmate? The inmate is wanted.
[1:18:53] <%dekkitout> She *had* a husband
[1:18:54] <%W1nterTitan> hell yeah
[1:18:55] <%WutangchickeN> Overwatch is just for porn

[1:19:04] <%Monkeyweed21> yea her sister is Tracer according to my sources
[1:19:04] <AngryPumpkin1995> isn't that why the company was bought? access to all the porn
[1:19:05] <%SaiyanShoto> Overwatch was ALWAYS a porn vehicle
[1:19:07] <%GinAndRoses> all aboard the porn vehicle
[1:19:14] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @GhostlySkunk always has been
[1:19:17] <@Ranryu692> there's a Mutant named Orphan-Maker
[1:19:17] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Overwatch 2 will have extra porn
[1:19:18] <%Wynzler> Choo choo!
[1:19:19] <Cosairen> best wyvern in the game
[1:19:22] <%Bt_Robot> Overwatch, they ain't got no parents.
[1:19:24] <Treasure_Vault> My uncle had a porn vehicle, but his wife made him sell it.
[1:19:24] <%cade_calrayn> i'm sure you do prefer the sticky ammo, Plague
[1:19:25] <%GinAndRoses> ew gunners
[1:19:30] <fugly_nick> I hate this weird log armor Pat's got
[1:19:32] <%dekkitout> Plague is a pro gunner
[1:19:35] <Cosairen> just bring a million components
[1:19:37] <Radioactivetaco9> you dont actually "shoot" anything from the gunlance
[1:19:38] <%SaiyanShoto> The best thing to come from Overwatch is the porn Kreygasm
[1:19:38] <%FingaLights> Oh yeah, there was a Overwatch 2
[1:19:40] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[1:19:45] <kazadog> gunners are sub human

[1:19:50] <GiantRobort> i like light bow gun over heavy
[1:19:51] <%dekkitout> What a glorious duwang of ammo
[1:19:55] <$Cthulos> Overwatch? More like Orphanwatch
[1:19:56] <grimsbenis> you can craft the ammo on the go pat
[1:20:03] <+AWr00tBear> You can craft ammo on the radial menu
[1:20:04] <%Sotetsu> What is Easy Anticheat
[1:20:07] <grimsbenis> same, lbg is great in this game
[1:20:16] <grimsbenis> rapid is fantastic
[1:20:18] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Pat, don't tempt Crazy Talk like that
[1:20:23] <+Juriasu> you can probably mod it if you play offline I'm assuming
[1:20:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Pat is asking for it
[1:20:28] <%Saadi90> I’m getting it on PS5
[1:20:29] <Cosairen> not only can you craft on the fly you can macro it to craft on a wheel menu to keep shooting forever
[1:20:30] <%RD_NX> Can easy-anticheat be avoided by going offline?
[1:20:33] <%SaiyanShoto> As someone who’s playing it on my PS5 I have no opinion on it
[1:20:37] <GiantRobort> fromsoft has no idea how internet works
[1:20:37] <%cvp5127> im playing offline at launch anyways
[1:20:42] <tanarath> This wont stop hacking, Pat.
[1:20:55] <Supwizy> Just dodge roll the hack dagger noob Kappa
[1:21:01] <Pookiedaexzile> They live in Japan they don't give a fuck

[1:21:08] <%TerpanderLux> D:
[1:21:10] <DancesWitBalrog> " I WONT STOP CHEATING!"
[1:21:17] <%SaiyanShoto> Does it even really do anything? I’m not knowledgeable on the subject
[1:21:21] <DancesWitBalrog> "YOU CANT STOP ME FROM CHEATING"
[1:21:31] <Cosairen> he wasnt readied up
[1:21:31] <%Sotetsu> HR113, wow. Is there a limit?
[1:21:34] <DancesWitBalrog> "I MUST CHEAT"
[1:21:34] <grimsbenis> Oh god I didnt see plagues HR until now
[1:21:34] <Kex173> "i'll take my cheating elsewhere"
[1:21:43] <grimsbenis> 999 is the limit
[1:21:44] <kazadog> @Sotetsu 999
[1:21:45] <Cosairen> @Sotetsu 999
[1:21:55] <%RD_NX> After the PC launch of DS3 being buggy, I'm planning on waiting a week for the inevitable early patch before buying.
[1:22:00] <%Sotetsu> Dng
[1:22:12] <%DashXero> But it's a great opportunity to cut the tail.
[1:22:16] <%Sotetsu> I thought the Cheat was to the limit.
[1:22:17] <SolumFuturae> Matching armor is couple goals.
[1:22:24] <%Wynzler> she poisons you with her back talons
[1:22:26] <%TerpanderLux> i fought so many rathians all her mannerisms are seared into my head
[1:22:31] <+CAPSLOCKlive> She flips when she flips
[1:22:34] <%Wynzler> Not her tail
[1:22:36] <Cosairen> and shes still way cooler than her stupid flying husband
[1:22:43] <DancesWitBalrog> she can do it. she can do it 5 times
[1:22:51] <%TerpanderLux> no
[1:22:56] <$Cthulos> 9 times
[1:22:57] <%Taisuru> She scream at own meme
[1:23:03] <+froduck42> that poor dog
[1:23:13] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Cut that tail!!
[1:23:16] <%YakumoYomi> Careful with those Stickies, Plague
[1:23:20] <sheepysenka> no don't fuck pony
[1:23:29] <%IamGrapes> she likes to charge, too
[1:23:59] <Cosairen> atleast her sideways tailswipe doesnt have wind pressure anymore :)
[1:23:59] <SolumFuturae> women do be flying

[1:24:13] <%Taisuru> Paige you should know this, you also breath fire when pissed
[1:24:24] <knight_verse> Pat... you have a shield.... block with it. NotLikeThis
[1:24:28] <%TerpanderLux> no she wont. youll see.

[1:24:32] <+CAPSLOCKlive> She has children! They will becomem Orphans!!
[1:25:02] <%TerpanderLux> how sensual
[1:25:03] <DrkJP520> rathalos just starts spinning without fucking warning
[1:25:04] <%YakumoYomi> They didn't used to look behind them before the tail spins
[1:25:04] <GiantRobort> volvidon's tongue attack has zero tell
[1:25:07] <GiantRobort> and i hate it
[1:25:13] <$D4C_Trice> hip checks and tail spins have no wind up animations to me
[1:25:18] <artificiallynatural> I find lots of the new monsters have very clear tells but the older ones tend to be pretty random with how clear their attacks are
[1:25:25] <Cosairen> volvidon can go to hell
[1:25:28] <AoG_JarlRaven> the jank tells
[1:25:31] <DancesWitBalrog> they all killed Orphan of Kos, so i dont think they give a shiet
[1:25:37] <+rasend0ri> Everyone needs to realize that Plague is playing with a semi chub
[1:25:38] <Kex173> does mounting still exist?
[1:25:53] <susukouhai> It used to look extra jank and that was the shit
[1:26:00] <artificiallynatural> @Kex173 nah, got replaced by wyvern riding
[1:26:07] <%Taisuru> psaGiefstare
[1:26:10] <Cosairen> if you get the wirebug counter triangle and circle straight after gives you an saed
[1:26:12] <%Agami23> @Kex173 its been replaced with a rodeo system where you play as the monster
[1:26:13] <$D4C_Trice> I think it was smart that the player character give you audio cues for dangerous attacks
[1:26:24] <+rasend0ri> No instead Hunter use bugs to ride and control monsters
[1:26:24] <%dekkitout> More dakka, Plague
[1:26:26] <%GinAndRoses> shouldn't you be on the tail anyway pat

[1:27:42] <Shardlab> It's a grocery store
[1:27:45] <%Wynzler> orphans be like "it's morphine time"
[1:27:51] <T_Sasquatch> pat is done like the parents of an orphan
[1:27:52] <%Wynzler> Because they're sick from a lack of health care
[1:27:57] <+desfore> Grocery store
[1:27:59] <AoG_JarlRaven> Pat doesn't buy groceries how would he know
[1:28:01] <+CAPSLOCKlive> @sheepysenka A Parentless Stream!! Indeed!!
[1:28:04] <Aydarkzero> Pat not using GS?
[1:28:05] <+rdark_ksu> Sounds like Mono
[1:28:06] <Latija> pregnant
[1:28:19] <T_Sasquatch> Blood sugar maybe
[1:28:19] <Darkdrill> BibleThump  leave the orphans alone just like there parents BibleThump
[1:28:19] <%GinAndRoses> charge blade
[1:28:20] <+CAPSLOCKlive> Vitamin D joke incoming
[1:28:20] <KnifeyMcEdge> Gregnant
[1:28:22] <+SneakyBeaver102> Living is tiring
[1:28:24] <DrkJP520> A random HBG user once joined my game literally dressed as a clown, only firing shots that would knock teammates around.
[1:28:25] <brexdq> I live in America so I can't go to the hospital
[1:28:27] <DancesWitBalrog> sleeping too much leads to sleepiness ironically
[1:28:29] <%Agami23> still unable to get tails
[1:28:31] <%Taisuru> Pizza Cake!
[1:28:32] <%Bloomingzonda> Pat if you go on a date with someone who aint got no parents would you be getting some orphussy
[1:28:32] <%IamGrapes> like the Vitamin P?
[1:28:35] <simplyvince15> Gregnat
[1:28:36] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "when life really gets you down, and you feel worse than an orphan; XANAX!"
[1:28:40] <%ClericOfSparda> Plague's message is hilarious
[1:28:40] <Cosairen> butcher them later :)
[1:28:40] <+Tucker0603> no they don't pat
[1:28:42] <%cvp5127> butt stuff
[1:28:43] <%Wynzler> they get turned into glue
[1:28:47] <%Taisuru> S L I M E D
[1:28:49] <%DashXero> They study them before they're carved.
[1:28:49] <raineedaydreams> you take them to the Arena
[1:28:50] <%TheHateFish> More blood sugar, more iron, keep that up and give it like nine months
[1:28:54] <sheepysenka> I was worried why Plague was asking
[1:28:55] <Cosairen> for experiments or arena
[1:28:59] <AlexisDaPomky> Capture probably makes it so they can study them a bit before they kill them or something
[1:29:01] <%Agami23> some quests in the old game had you catch them to give to rich people as pets
[1:29:03] <yukichocomilk> you're delegating the killing
[1:29:04] <ahaegotrigger> you get more rewards for capture
[1:29:05] <Darkdrill> factory monsters are better processed
[1:29:06] <+desfore> They study them
[1:29:08] <DancesWitBalrog> keep the body as fresh as possibler
[1:29:09] <%FingaLights> Kill them more efficiently
[1:29:11] <%MooseIsGoose> They sometimes get released back to the wild at least in monster hunter world they did
[1:29:12] <GiantRobort> captured monsters get studdied before chopped up
[1:29:20] <%Taisuru> psaGiefstare
[1:29:21] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> so they know fear
[1:29:21] <Darthkitten_Prime> Some get killed, other get let go, but they want the live specimens to research them.
[1:29:22] <AoG_JarlRaven> In XCOM you can study aliens after you kill them
[1:29:23] <%Wynzler> because the professonal carvers are better at getting more materials from their corpses than you are
[1:29:24] <ahaegotrigger> I think its just having more people able to carve bits off at once or something
[1:29:27] <%Sotetsu> The capture mechanic is dumb, just finish the hunt normally
[1:29:28] <%GinAndRoses> psaGiefrail
[1:29:29] <+creamandsugar> carved up at base means can get more fragile or skilled extracts wit better rates. But also they're ecologists so they study the things an don't always murder them
[1:29:30] <susukouhai> Carve efficiently if u bring the whole thing back
[1:29:30] <DancesWitBalrog> the factory kills ethically Kappa
[1:29:40] <%Taisuru> Love the fat boi
[1:29:45] <+hodoumoudou> that rathian just gave you 2 parts for capture. you know, vs. 3 carves...
[1:29:46] <%TheHateFish> Wait, seriously? I was making a pregnant joke and citing dumb random advice that they always seem to give
[1:29:48] <sheepysenka> Paige is aiming for the moon

[1:34:29] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> @applegreen92 Big pinecone
[1:34:52] <%Nekros4442> @PatStaresAt There's literally a skill archetype that's just about creating a umbillical cord to an ally and giving them big ass buffs
[1:34:57] <+A0N33> There is leveling syncing for party play but you still wind up way more powerful than the lower leveled character.
[1:35:02] <TrollKing96> Does Path Of Exile have a Deckard Cain?
[1:35:09] <@JustinianKnight> look at you people with your doggos
[1:35:17] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Paige, The Dooky witch
[1:35:29] <%dekkitout> A Blade Runner?
[1:35:30] <+rasend0ri> The Gem system in Exile is NUTS
[1:35:35] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I don't even use the dog
[1:35:40] <+applegreen92> I'm honestly beyond fucking upset about how unreasonable double dipping Rise is
[1:35:45] <%Sotetsu> It PoE , he is named Beckard Pain.
[1:35:45] <Zombrocom> You kinda get a deckard in act 5? Sorta? Not really?
[1:35:46] <keohtv> He's dead now tho : (
[1:35:48] <%ChrisPlaysThing> in multi*
[1:36:13] <Supwizy> only game I double dipped is  NIOH 1 and 2
[1:36:14] <+Ricky_Rexx> Glad I never got Rise on switch for that reason. Just waited for Pc
[1:36:15] <@JustinianKnight> :)
[1:36:15] <+applegreen92> 60 fucking dollars plush 30 for expansion
[1:36:15] <tanarath> I think it might have an old loremaster, but identifying items is BY DESIGN always going to cost materials
[1:36:22] <Hydrapissed> I mean time to start YOINKING
[1:36:24] <%Sotetsu> Aww, I'll play with you, Pat
[1:36:29] <ExpressNode> That's why I never touched World and this on console
[1:36:29] <%DashXero> I'm kind of surprised this game runs on my potato pc.
[1:36:29] <keohtv> I can justify rise for PC
[1:36:29] <Zombrocom> Yeah I just waited for the PC version for that reason
[1:36:34] <keohtv> It's fun and I enjoyed it
[1:36:34] <BigYanno> SONIC UNDERGROOOOOOUND
[1:36:37] <+Ricky_Rexx> He's a little fella

[1:37:02] <%Bloomingzonda> Plague is covered in pookay juice
[1:37:03] <%Sotetsu> Paige got lost.
[1:37:06] <Hydrapissed> shell fell down and she cant GET UP
[1:37:07] <$D4C_Trice> honestly rise on switch was kind of ass as there was so much missing content
[1:37:13] <+rasend0ri> No crossplay OR crosssave. Like what the actual FUCK Capcom!!!!
[1:37:15] <ExpressNode> Also might do the same for SMT V and wait to see if it will get a PC release
[1:37:17] <+applegreen92> There's "haha I just wait for the PC version" and then there's "literally everyone plays on Switch instead why am I buying this"
[1:37:19] <%FacetiousAF> @SvenHolgersson stop having bad opinions and maybe
[1:37:19] <Cosairen> kinda sad that they didnt make deserted isle for rise even though they made plains and flooded forest
[1:37:23] <%Agami23> does paige know to run up walls?
[1:37:24] <@JustinianKnight> cross save woulda been nice
[1:37:33] <Zeif00> monkaS
[1:37:35] <+hodoumoudou> this isn't that small, pukei just looks smaller in rise because the camera is zoomed out more!
[1:37:41] <+hodoumoudou> anjanath has the same issue
[1:37:44] <+Ricky_Rexx> that weapon looks sick af design wise
[1:37:46] <%SvenHolgersson> @SvenHolgersson I have the best opinions, How. Dare.

[1:47:05] <%SvenHolgersson> The Lupus has humbled the Paige
[1:47:05] <%RetroCop87> is that why you call Paige a bitch every day?
[1:47:06] <+MarsKarl> that always works!
[1:47:10] <%dekkitout> It worked on my sisters. They're mellow as hell now

[1:48:08] <KnifeyMcEdge> been there
[1:48:12] <+projectmanatees> paid IQ test LUL
[1:48:13] <sheepysenka> "Always look for the free test"
[1:48:20] <%Sotetsu> Your advice is to not listen to your advice... so I should... so I shouldn't....
[1:48:21] <%tinyswampthing> remember when pat told kids to smoke crack
[1:48:22] <+Ricky_Rexx> paying for an IQ test is a test itself
[1:48:29] <$Jaxnos> issa true
[1:48:29] <Hydrapissed> the iq argument yep good start Clap
[1:48:30] <BigYanno> Bruh the IQ test was invented for CHILDREN
[1:48:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's impossible to get over 100 on an online IQ test
[1:48:35] <+2DSuperiority> the world's strongest oprhan can never beat me up
[1:48:40] <%SaiyanShoto> A smart person doesn’t need to prove who’s smarter
[1:48:40] <%Bloomingzonda> I followed Paige's example and got some really ugly boots
[1:48:42] <%TerpanderLux> chjbDrakebutitsBaldCena
[1:48:45] <jacobetc> but see that was good advice to not listen to your advice so you give good advice! my brain hurts
[1:48:46] <%Bluwizard21> everybody crap ur hands
[1:48:46] <Cosairen> average american
[1:48:47] <%DashXero> IQ tests are poor indicators of who is smart. I know high IQ people who freeze all the time.
[1:48:49] <%cade_calrayn> gief took it
[1:48:49] <%FacetiousAF> clap ya hands everybody
[1:48:51] <CurrySauseBandit> That people have been using Pat's advice itself is worrying for humanity as a whole.
[1:48:53] <%Dakuu75> do we need to use 1 Flinch Free in this with ppl?
[1:48:55] <%FacetiousAF> and everybody clap ya hands
[1:48:55] <%cvp5127> paige really is american she loves to clap

[1:50:34] <BigYanno> The reason it's never Lupus is cos Paige has all the lupus
[1:50:35] <Mattais88> "Eli, don't bring your gun" is a great quote
[1:50:36] <Latija> what even is a lupus
[1:50:39] <%Sotetsu> Wait, you have silly lupus?
[1:50:41] <TehMud> OH BOY

[1:50:53] <+DracosMagala> Mag is not a wall
[1:50:54] <$D4C_Trice> sorry to hear that. I don't know much about it other than it being on House.
[1:50:56] <%BackflipCharm> You and Plague should just sit back and let Paige fight it herself for a bit
[1:50:57] <%SaiyanShoto> I disagree with plague
[1:50:57] <Hydrapissed> plague hates anything actually fun Clap
[1:50:59] <%hotcarl6872> This is gonna be great.

[1:51:00] <+Tucker0603> Eli is wrong in my opinion
[1:51:03] <%dekkitout> This mfkr zips around wildly, it's a jump in difficulty
[1:51:03] <abowlofbeets> Bring the gun, but do nothing.
[1:51:03] <DianaTheAscian> I personally find this fight to be a joke
[1:51:04] <%Agami23> pat, is this one of those "keep the bads out" type of quests?
[1:51:09] <%FacetiousAF> reading..... is hard
[1:51:13] <%valriot> LUL Spammy bullshit - Plague
[1:51:14] <fatalDestiny> Thankfully the angry marshmallow is fun to fight with charge blade.

[1:53:11] <Supwizy> Who has the rights to the 4th portion of materials in the chest when you are with 3 people?
[1:53:12] <+applegreen92> this is the money making map\
[1:53:25] <+M0untain_wolf> Duel Dog Drifting ?
[1:53:30] <$D4C_Trice> welcome to the map where you have to mine for money when you get to HR
[1:53:30] <+rasend0ri> Oh chist
[1:53:31] <cpt_langosta> why does that smoke look like it's made of plastic?
[1:53:34] <%valriot> I loved it before doing the farming route
[1:53:36] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Maggy can just go to hell, very annoying to solo
[1:53:37] <GilliamYaeger> Confusing but one of the best maps in the franchise
[1:53:39] <%GinAndRoses> the volcano is v Kool
[1:53:41] <TehMud> Did Paige meet Khezu yet?
[1:53:45] <+Ricky_Rexx> Keep an eye on Paige she will wander off to another map entirely
[1:53:48] <$D4C_Trice> Good new bones too
[1:53:55] <%DashXero> Is this a max attack route? I'm still looking for a good one in this area.
[1:53:57] <%SaiyanShoto> Oh yeah this is one of the farming spots for money

[1:54:14] <%ChrisPlaysThing> free damage mitigation
[1:54:17] <+Tucker0603> @tehmud she thought the penis
[1:54:19] <TehMud> Good
[1:54:21] <+MarsKarl> classic pupborg
[1:54:24] <+CAPSLOCKlive> It has a Narrative
[1:54:28] <+Ricky_Rexx> the story is hunt monsters the fuck else do you need?
[1:54:28] <%Agami23> its not no setting but its got worldbuilding
[1:54:29] <%echobee_tv> 100 percent pat
[1:54:29] <%GinAndRoses> the story is you hit the monsters
[1:54:29] <Cosairen> the world building is great though
[1:54:30] <Hydrapissed> I for real want them to just not have a story just one game
[1:54:32] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Rise has the dumbest story honestly
[1:54:33] <Hydrapissed> they just go hey hit shit
[1:54:34] <$SGrim> So if Palamutes are Wyverians... are they sentient?
[1:54:34] <yukichocomilk> I'm happy that the story is less emphasized in this one
[1:54:36] <+killfrost11> monster hunter lore is dumb give me big dumb monster to smack
[1:54:36] <Supwizy> the cutscenes allow me to grab something to drink
[1:54:38] <Darkdrill> monster hunter world was pretty fun
[1:54:41] <cpt_langosta> but pat, what if we could talk to these monsters?
[1:54:41] <$D4C_Trice> MH4 had the most interesting narrative to me
[1:54:44] <TehMud> @Tucker0603 Good. I couldn't remember the order you meet mons
[1:54:46] <Hydrapissed> JUST ONE GAME just NO STORY just say hey go hit shit
[1:54:48] <+Ricky_Rexx> @CAPSLOCKlive Narrative is a strong word /s
[1:54:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> Palio’s are also dragons
[1:54:50] <%ChrisPlaysThing> The story is always an excuse to go kill dinosaures
[1:54:50] <%valriot> They Do Be Malding - The Game
[1:54:51] <%dekkitout> And half the time it's a purple evil thing
[1:54:52] <%SaiyanShoto> Monsters are having an orgy in the volcano!
[1:54:55] <Manwad> Oh no it's a big monster!
[1:54:56] <Hydrapissed> MARSHMALLO lets goo
[1:54:56] <Treasure_Vault> Pat told me more about the monster hunter story in a paragraph in a podcast than the entirety of world ever accomplished.
[1:54:57] <%GinAndRoses> BETTER GO KILL THEM
[1:54:57] <+MarsKarl> "what if we killed all of them over and over to FIX the ecosystem"
[1:54:58] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> At least 4 has gore so its cool to do
[1:55:00] <VallerinTerra> Guess what? It's a MONSTER'S fault so you can go kill the monster
[1:55:00] <%dekkitout> Oh hey look, a purple evil thing
[1:55:02] <+Grayhammatter> oh wait, magnamalo at this level? hoo boy

[1:55:02] <Aydarkzero> purple fire monkaS
[1:55:02] <abowlofbeets> I recently learned the lore of Monster Hunter. I was genuinely not excepting it to be post apocalyptic

[1:56:04] <Pookiedaexzile> "Whats fucking up the monsters Ecosystem, Is it us? killing them?"

[1:57:55] <%Monkeyweed21> man I cant wait to see MR Magnamalo
[1:57:57] <%Dakuu75> true
[1:58:01] <CurrySauseBandit> Yep. Healer code. "Ya'll suck, so I gotta deal with it"
[1:58:01] <%Dakuu75> so-true
[1:58:03] <simplyvince15> For me Magnamalo is definitely one of the best Flagships. Right up there with Gore for me.
[1:58:03] <+Pachi3000> No this is the MID game boss
[1:58:07] <Cosairen> @TurtlesAndTentacles nah its just on the boxart
[1:58:07] <%Nekros4442> True
[1:58:08] <+Pachi3000> But he is the game's flagship monster

[1:58:56] <+creamandsugar> aim at other monster, use him for big damage then charge, knock over other monster. Now use that monster to turbostomp monster you gotta hunt
[1:58:58] <GilliamYaeger> ANGEREY

[2:02:14] <%TheWinged7> a shogun
[2:02:15] <Hydrapissed> samurai and fire crackers

[2:02:20] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Oni
[2:02:20] <GilliamYaeger> His theme is demon samurai

[2:02:40] <+Ricky_Rexx> His armor set is sick as fuck tho
[2:02:44] <Zombrocom> He's themed after Onibi/Spirit fire/Will o the wisps
[2:02:49] <ScreamLord> Magnamalo is the unholy union of Zinogre, Teostra, Valstrax, and Nergigante
[2:02:55] <cpt_langosta> fun historical fact: naginata were invented to pull fire escape ladders down
[2:02:58] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> And sunbreak is apparently western mythology
[2:03:01] <Darthkitten_Prime> Samurai, and I always thought he was based on a Nue, with the tiger motif, baboon face, and the long flexible snake-like tail.
[2:03:06] <ScreamLord> @Zombrocom And Samurai armor
[2:03:10] <Hydrapissed> no paige would say IMA FUK EM
[2:03:14] <+rasend0ri> He is the Tiger from all the story of the Tiger vs the Dragon
[2:03:18] <$D4C_Trice> yari are pretty dope
[2:03:19] <%JoshManVGH> She honk, and bonk
[2:03:20] <Zombrocom> Ghost fire samurai tiger.
[2:03:24] <Zombrocom> Basically.
[2:03:27] <+killfrost11> big weapon go smash more unga bunga

[2:04:45] <yukichocomilk> why get his armor if it's only good against him?
[2:04:52] <%FacetiousAF> pog

[2:05:31] <%akss421> akss421 gifted a Tier 1 sub to 2ndRespawn! 
[2:05:34] <Cosairen> i was thinking like tigrex yeah but i guess lagi was the most recent
[2:05:37] <%Dakuu75> @yukichocomilk it's fun to summon that purple fire on you anytime something rages
[2:05:40] <+Pachi3000> I think she will
[2:05:43] <%Artoo__The_Me> Magnamalo’s gear is perfect for low to mid high rank
[2:05:47] <Zombrocom> The credits are for the village quests
[2:05:48] <MrMoonGoose> I'm here to drink wine and watch vidya
[2:05:49] <+ALazo> when sunbreak comes out high rank becomes the new tutorial
[2:05:51] <+rasend0ri> SHE NOICED ME!!!!!
[2:06:03] <MrMoonGoose> NOICE
[2:06:11] <Latija> even though its like 15 hours in at most
[2:06:18] <%RealThiele> you beat nothing
[2:06:19] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @echobee_tv char gundam red comet, got the sauce
[2:06:21] <DaKnightWarrior> Low rank materials can't be used to get talismans.
[2:06:21] <ScreamLord> And then High Rank is the Advanced tutorial before G/Master Rank comes out
[2:06:22] <%Bluwizard21> get lost and cry about it
[2:06:23] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Same thing when you beat glavenus in GU too
[2:06:29] <GilliamYaeger> God that armor looks so good
[2:06:30] <%ClericOfSparda> Lookin' good, Joker!
[2:06:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Congratulations You didn't win, not even a little bit

[2:06:51] <+killfrost11> randos are the worst
[2:07:08] <%TheWinged7> hi, im the problem
[2:07:10] <%FacetiousAF> randos are always the problem
[2:07:10] <+killfrost11> they are limmings
[2:07:21] <+charp35> Yup
[2:07:23] <Mattais88> Ahd a few of those tonight myself
[2:07:28] <%ClericOfSparda> I'm both
[2:07:29] <%DashXero> Here's the sad thing:  Randos are the primary challenge once you've seen everything.
[2:07:31] <ScreamLord> Alatreon was nearly impossible too beat with randos
[2:07:31] <%akss421> randos will kill when you want capture and the reverse
[2:07:32] <%Agami23> or they dont go for the parts.
[2:07:33] <+charp35> Eiter amazing or shit
[2:07:33] <Treasure_Vault> I was so tired of randos that I learned fatalis solo
[2:07:36] <+killfrost11> gods at the game or brain dead
[2:07:38] <+rasend0ri> How come Pat isn’t using the most Japanese weapon in the most Japanese themed game!!!!
[2:07:41] <%CptCreampuff16> tobi kadachi next?
[2:07:41] <%Artoo__The_Me> Something about MH:W randos really changed my outlook on players. I miss the old day randos
[2:07:42] <%FacetiousAF> i was a rando the other day who didn't go hang out by the trap someone put down FeelsBadMan
[2:07:42] <%Dakuu75> I mean... beating the monster before you get there is kinda.... just bad-luck
[2:07:44] <+MarsKarl> if only there was a cool sherpa program from MonHun where epic players could teach newbies
[2:07:50] <%Agami23> fucking fighting zinorgre and no one going for the hands

[2:08:03] <+Double_Tap_That> I run the Narwa HH specifically to counter rando death.

[2:08:20] <$Jaxnos> i exclusively played with randos in World for the shot that i can be carried by the three Japanese peeps that rolled in at 2am my time
[2:08:50] <%Artoo__The_Me> MH:Gen and before randos felt way more competent than MH:W randos

[2:09:21] <DaKnightWarrior> Forget randos rather just solo the game
[2:09:31] <cpt_langosta> i feel like the pat/paige household needs one of those star-wars-float-in-the-liquid recovery tanks for paige to use... approximately once a day
[2:09:34] <Cosairen> the best part of having an elder dragon as your favorite monster is that you know they're coming back i cant think of a game that doesnt have teo
[2:09:43] <%echobee_tv> @daknightwarrior yes this
[2:09:46] <%RD_NX> I was only able to beat furious rajang in world by shooting up a flare and getting rando help from japan
[2:10:13] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Rise didn't launch with teo in LUL
[2:10:26] <Shwepie> @Artoo__The_Me MHW brought in a lot of new people to the series and the average skill level tanked instantly.
[2:10:35] <Mattais88> Solo'ing Rajang with a horn is a goddman chore
[2:10:39] <Cosairen> @Kobi_Robi_Tobi did for me :)
[2:11:32] <Aydarkzero> is Nergigante in this?
[2:11:41] <Cosairen> rajang in rise feels like he was designed for rage slash gs
[2:11:46] <DaKnightWarrior> @aydarkzero no
[2:11:50] <Cosairen> nergi is not in atleast for now
[2:11:56] <%echobee_tv> unfortunately nerg is not
[2:11:57] <Sakhasa> @RD_NX thank god for japanese players. saved my ass a few times during mhw
[2:11:58] <Aydarkzero> Sadge
[2:11:58] <%Artoo__The_Me> @shwepie Honestly it was such a dual edged sword for me. Made me happy it finally got popular in the west, but also the toxicity rolled in so hard with it
[2:12:11] <Ginganinja4545> Im just hapoy Mizu escaoed the 3ds
[2:12:22] <DaKnightWarrior> GS beats Rajang so hard.
[2:12:39] <Cosairen> mizu should be a staple i love him
[2:12:49] <+Leedle1116> teo wasnt in tri
[2:13:11] <Cosairen> tri didnt have like half of anything good
[2:13:16] <Cosairen> but fair play
[2:13:19] <Ginganinja4545> Theres too many monsters in 4 that havent been ported forward tho :(
[2:13:31] <DaKnightWarrior> I hope Astalos makes it into Sunbreak.
[2:13:39] <Cosairen> where great jaggi capcom
[2:13:52] <%echobee_tv> dalmadur when
[2:13:54] <%Artoo__The_Me> @cosairen Tri ultimate/g I will defend
[2:14:00] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Let's be real, tri introduced like almost every cool monster
[2:14:16] <Ginganinja4545> Queen Seltas so woolie can play the game cause it has a mech
[2:14:24] <Cosairen> 3u is good tri was dogwater except for like medium bowgun
[2:14:53] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Medium bowgun is the centrist of bowguns
[2:14:55] <%SvenHolgersson> Stop blowing out her back Patrick. Rude.

[2:20:30] <%GinAndRoses> do not talk to longsword users
[2:20:33] <Hydrapissed> Ls is so weeb course they luv it
[2:20:37] <%JoshManVGH> Is it also impacted by that ice dragon weapon in World, with the unique mechanic?

[2:22:29] <%SaiyanShoto> I did that in World LUL LUL
[2:22:31] <Ginganinja4545> you take that back the bhnabra set is beautiful
[2:22:32] <Blank9> it's a learning experience
[2:22:36] <+rasend0ri> Oh my god
[2:22:38] <Blank9> just like making nioh playable
[2:22:40] <madogod> and then Iceborne came out...
[2:22:41] <%Artoo__The_Me> Oh noooo
[2:22:41] <+sunny_side_up> see thats why you just make the jaggi armor and speedrun to high rank
[2:22:43] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[2:22:43] <Cosairen> @notsoy its okay it needs some better switch skills but the dragoon dive feels great
[2:22:45] <DianaTheAscian> Did you cry?

[2:22:50] <%Monkeyweed21> I did that too lol
[2:22:58] <%notsoy> nice, I'll try it in the demo when I get home
[2:23:03] <%ChrisPlaysThing> nevermind, looked it up, i'm wrong an legit flipped the words
[2:23:11] <%notsoy> back in 4u u mailed charge blade and insect glaive
[2:23:13] <+Leedle1116> i made the leather armor instead of chainmail because i thought i'd move faster LUL
[2:23:14] <%OrangeMDT> I farmed in World and cried a little
[2:23:22] <%notsoy> *I mained
[2:23:29] <Oxybe> IG wasn't really given much buff in Rise. better aerial damage but ground is till better DPS and they made Iceborn's aerial dive into a wirebug move that's somewhat harder to land
[2:23:36] <Mattais88> Then you get a set like the Bazel one thats basically made for Gunlance only
[2:23:39] <Hydrapissed> I mean in rise they lessend that to
[2:23:45] <%SaiyanShoto> I’m so glad layered armor is a thing now
[2:23:50] <Darthkitten_Prime> A lot of the early armor sets are good for farming materials
[2:23:55] <%GinAndRoses> stylish finish
[2:23:59] <Cosairen> and thats why nargacuga has some of the best gear all the time LUL
[2:24:02] <BinaryShuffle> That switchaxe tho
[2:24:03] <%JobbedBone> Kirby power armor
[2:24:04] <Zeif00> I feel like that's a grandfathered in design element
[2:24:06] <DianaTheAscian> we if everything had attack up, def up etc it would be boring
[2:24:15] <Hydrapissed> god the charm FARM CAN FUCK OFF
[2:24:16] <%Artoo__The_Me> But it looked so goooood
[2:24:18] <%Monkeyweed21> nah bro just play around a gimmick status effect
[2:24:21] <%dekkitout> The talismans psaSkelmo
[2:24:24] <%SaiyanShoto> It should be though that if you make the armor set then you unlock it as a layered armor option
[2:24:26] <kazadog> id rather make charms than decos tbh
[2:24:27] <Hydrapissed> MAKING CHARMS is worse then the deco farm
[2:24:33] <%D00msDayDan> they replaced decoration gacha with talisman gacha
[2:24:33] <+rasend0ri> I learned that the hard way because I killed Magnamalo 20 times for a PLATE on low rank.
[2:24:37] <%ChrisPlaysThing> No, stop adding carrots
[2:24:42] <artificiallynatural> trying to roll charms is awful
[2:24:45] <%ChrisPlaysThing> just make pretty things
[2:24:47] <+hodoumoudou> iceborne made it so all the g-rank armor just had different types of affinity skills and it was pretty boring tho
[2:24:59] <Cosairen> the chance of really good talismans is 1 in billions
[2:25:03] <Cosairen> its awful
[2:25:20] <Hydrapissed> hellll no pat get READY for rise
[2:25:21] <+sunny_side_up> the chance of good enough talismans is much better tho
[2:25:24] <Hydrapissed> rollig charms SUXS
[2:25:28] <+rasend0ri> Only for me to unlock High rank five hunts later much to my chagrin!
[2:25:35] <%dekkitout> I wonder if someone got around to... "resolving" talisman rng...
[2:25:35] <%Artoo__The_Me> I’ll take this one any day
[2:25:38] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I got lucky in world and found 3 attack gems right away
[2:25:41] <Treasure_Vault> Thank god for mods and cheat engine.
[2:25:47] <BlindGato> 1000 hours for ONE attack deco
[2:25:47] <DaKnightWarrior> It took me 2000 hours to get every deco in World Iceborne LUL
[2:25:49] <Hydrapissed> U GOT to roll a charm that can have 8 skills on it perfectly
[2:25:51] <Hydrapissed> its a nightmare
[2:25:53] <+sunny_side_up> like sure, the perfect talisman is impossible, but you dont need a perfect talisman. wex2 level 3 slot is like 1/2400 or some shit and thats good enough for almost any build
[2:26:00] <%Artoo__The_Me> @patstaresat you have more control in this version that lottery
[2:26:03] <Hydrapissed> id rather farm for 1 attack deco then this charm bs
[2:26:06] <Darthkitten_Prime> I really liked the Guiding Lands in Iceborne
[2:26:14] <Oxybe> Talisman farming is better then deco farming, but they're both shit. the latter is just shit with sprinkles
[2:26:22] <Cosairen> in 4u i NEVER got a good talisman because i had a cursed charm table
[2:26:23] <+wizard_of_diamonds> What is the point of Rampage Weapons anyway?
[2:26:25] <Oxybe> the former
[2:26:28] <Cosairen> made me wanna die
[2:26:29] <%Artoo__The_Me> They add it in g rank
[2:26:40] <Hydrapissed> rampge weps are for like what bows and guns bout it lol
[2:26:47] <ArOne_Start> you could pump low rank armor to have defense at parity with high rank if you wanted specific skill point spreads
[2:26:50] <%Artoo__The_Me> THERE WAS
[2:27:04] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I'm still not done iceborn
[2:27:07] <Cosairen> its good for horn and bow too
[2:27:15] <%ChrisPlaysThing> 340 hours in
[2:27:16] <Hydrapissed> yah horn to
[2:27:20] <%DashXero> Pat's gonna play SnS?! Hell yeah!
[2:27:20] <Hydrapissed> rampage is for horns bow and guns
[2:27:22] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> dual blades are good to rampage wise
[2:27:22] <%GinAndRoses> aknosom is also cool
[2:27:27] <+rasend0ri> Christ, what would PvP be like in MonHunt
[2:27:31] <+Double_Tap_That> Ironically, I find the only time knowing what specific weapon another person has is when they are using a HH.
[2:27:32] <+M0untain_wolf> wut
[2:27:33] <+hodoumoudou> gunlance rampage has a good sharpness spread and can use high level shots
[2:27:34] <kazadog> mothman incoming
[2:27:36] <Hydrapissed> Western yokai wtf
[2:27:37] <%dekkitout> Paul Bunion?
[2:27:37] <%TheWinged7> ak-no-som
[2:27:38] <@goose_attack_almanac> Wendigo?
[2:27:38] <%CalderGaming> sdo like, bnigfoot and mothman?
[2:27:39] <%AlteisenReiseZ> So like western mythological creaturs
[2:27:41] <%Artoo__The_Me> SO GOOD
[2:27:41] <Hydrapissed> so just vampires?
[2:27:44] <markdreizehn> Isn't that just a Cryptid????
[2:27:46] <%AlteisenReiseZ> MOTHMAN LETS GOOOO
[2:27:47] <ergulor> cmon gigginox
[2:27:50] <%Deft_Thought> Guiding Lands sucked
[2:27:50] <Blank9> MOTHMAN
[2:27:51] <+2DSuperiority> Like Yokai Watch 3
[2:27:52] <%Dakuu75> sounds like the opposite of Odogaron...
[2:27:52] <DeathByPoke7> so the devil
[2:27:52] <+rasend0ri> Extremely bizarre
[2:27:54] <cpt_langosta> chupa-thingy!
[2:27:55] <Darthkitten_Prime> Vampires and Werewolves so far
[2:27:55] <dimensaur> get ready for Kirin to come back
[2:27:57] <%HarmonicArsenal> motherfuckin vampires
[2:27:57] <%akss421> turn dango into doughtnut holes
[2:27:57] <%RD_NX> Oh my fucking god really?
[2:27:58] <Hydrapissed> so its vampires and werewolves
[2:27:58] <Blank9> hell yeah mothman mind
[2:28:00] <Hydrapissed> TWILIGHT TIME
[2:28:01] <+Grayhammatter> mothman LETS GO
[2:28:02] <Cosairen> MOTHMAN MONSTER
[2:28:05] <%CalderGaming> YO BABA YAGA INC
[2:28:05] <Treasure_Vault> the chupacabra
[2:28:06] <keohtv> Werewolves, Vampires, Yetis, Ghost, Goblins, ect
[2:28:07] <%dekkitout> They've shown a vamp dragon and different zinogre- I mean werewolf
[2:28:07] <%notsoy> like central america/Caribbean spirits?
[2:28:08] <faldin> yo what
[2:28:09] <Hydrapissed> its a vampire yeh
[2:28:10] <+M0untain_wolf> wow BORAD
[2:28:13] <Hydrapissed> and there is a werewolf TO
[2:28:15] <Darthkitten_Prime> I'm assuming they mean more gothic horror kind of monsters
[2:28:19] <+imthewisejanitor> VUSSY...?
[2:28:23] <Mastigias> Here's hoping for Bigfoot.
[2:28:26] <$realm_forge> BIG FOOT LETS GOOOOOO
[2:28:27] <Treasure_Vault> jersey devil
[2:28:27] <markdreizehn> We'll finally get the Mummy Dragon
[2:28:28] <%akss421> what monster is rudy guliani
[2:28:30] <+Roivas1991> If they're doing "Western Yokai," they should bring back Kirin.
[2:28:30] <Oxybe> Jersey Devil, Chupacabra, Mothman, the Sasquach, etc...
[2:28:31] <%RD_NX> I want a skinwalker that disguises itself as a palico or something.
[2:28:32] <DeathByPoke7> can victor from dark stalkers be a monster
[2:28:34] <+Double_Tap_That> Isn't that just Vaal Hazak?
[2:28:35] <+Dorf1> khezu has frankenstien themed armor
[2:28:37] <+Roivas1991> It's a unicorn.
[2:28:38] <%JobbedBone> there should do the diablo thing where you pay something to pick some of the modifiers to lock in permanently and the rest reroll
[2:28:41] <Cosairen> khezu already has weapons like frankenstein
[2:28:43] <%Puhff> CHUPACABRA
[2:28:45] <%ForneusAtSeaWorld> nakarkos
[2:28:46] <Hydrapissed> hey PUT IT IN now
[2:28:46] <%DashXero> Nakarkos uses other monsters' skeletons as a puppet...
[2:28:48] <%Nobrev> I want monster hunter mothman, jersey devil, and hodag
[2:28:50] <Darthkitten_Prime> It's not actually part of the lore, it's cut content.
[2:28:53] <DrkJP520> I played 1000+h of MHW and never got the guard deco (that lets you block unblockables)
[2:28:55] <%Puhff> BIGFOOT
[2:28:59] <buerdo> they have shown vampire, werewolf and crab from sunbreak
[2:28:59] <+rasend0ri> Yokai is not an umbrella term. It’s exclusively for Japan.
[2:29:04] <fojidoj> It’s a shame that Sunbreak didn’t get the Witcher crossover with the western monsters
[2:29:05] <kazadog> put in a bunyip you capcom cowards
[2:29:13] <ExpressNode> You give me a Chupacabra on steroids
[2:29:15] <+rasend0ri> What about Val Hazzak?
[2:29:16] <%Puhff> MOTHMAAAAAAN brendaChamp  brendaChamp
[2:29:17] <%Monkeyweed21> the closest would be Nakarkos puppeting the bones of other monsters
[2:29:24] <Darthkitten_Prime> @Nobrev Yoooo, I never thought I'd ever see anyone else mention a hodag, it's my hometown mascot.
[2:29:40] <cpt_langosta> Monster Hunter: Nathan 4 U
[2:29:43] <Cosairen> gogma is still the best siege
[2:29:46] <DianaTheAscian> His design was incredible
[2:29:48] <%zarkazeon> GOGMAZIOS!!!!
[2:30:05] <+sunny_side_up> dude i soloed gog because the randoms were so fucking shit
[2:30:13] <Cosairen> you had to play at 4am na time
[2:30:14] <Oxybe> Ogopogo could be the annoying watery monster
[2:30:14] <%zarkazeon> Such a badass he's got a dragonat9r stuck in him
[2:30:31] <%JobbedBone> Kreygasm etalSquish
[2:30:35] <Cosairen> the french were so bad in 4u
[2:30:44] <Ginganinja4545> je sui monte
[2:30:50] <Oxybe> Je suis monte
[2:30:51] <%ChrisPlaysThing> BOTH
[2:30:52] <%Dakuu75> I've had a LOT of trouble with Teostra and randos
[2:30:54] <Oxybe> pardon
[2:30:54] <%DashXero> No. They're getting easier.
[2:30:55] <%dekkitout> @Ginganinja4545 Pardon
[2:30:57] <DianaTheAscian> they have not gotten more babyfied
[2:31:00] <cpt_langosta> disagreeing with monster hunter fans is always morally correct
[2:31:01] <+Resderp> Admittedly wirebug turns a lot of monsters in this game into a joke
[2:31:01] <%HarmonicArsenal> the monsters are falling behind
[2:31:06] <%SvenHolgersson> I love when olds cry that it was hard back in the day
[2:31:06] <%Fairy_princess77> It's easier DUE to better designed
[2:31:07] <Radioactivetaco9> no they are just getting easier. They are buffing defensive mechanics a shit ton
[2:31:09] <%SvenHolgersson> It's very funny
[2:31:09] <%DashXero> There's a lack of a focus on discipline.
[2:31:13] <kazadog> BabyRage I wanna have to empty my pouch after every hunt
[2:31:18] <Cosairen> @Ginganinja4545 THE TRUE COMBO LUL
[2:31:20] <+MoaLaMoa> wow my game has good controls and is more fun? casual trash
[2:31:21] <Hydrapissed> will wait till sunbreak and lets see people say how weak the monsters are lol
[2:31:22] <%Deft_Thought> Having supers was wild
[2:31:22] <%SvenHolgersson> I'm so sorry more people are playing your game series
[2:31:22] <+rasend0ri> Look at Souls games
[2:31:28] <Hydrapissed> and iceborne put people in their place lol
[2:31:33] <+CheshirePierrot> the mobility of Greatsword in Rise is INSANE
[2:31:35] <Darthkitten_Prime> That said, Fatalis was still hard as fuck in Iceborne
[2:31:35] <+Resderp> Wirebugs give player mobility that you didnt have in World. So it feels clunky in comparison to Rise
[2:31:37] <+CheshirePierrot> favorite weapon
[2:31:41] <DianaTheAscian> @kazadog NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:31:44] <Ginganinja4545> dude I went back to 4 the other day and holy shit its unplayable now
[2:31:46] <%JobbedBone> easier = better designed for people that have a life LUL
[2:32:00] <%AlteisenReiseZ> DRINK. AND FLEX/
[2:32:06] <$scallycap> this hitboxes in new MH are astounding
[2:32:21] <buerdo> I've gone back to play 4u 3u and fu after rise
[2:32:21] <+sunny_side_up> and also part of it is MHFU tigrex's hitboxes can fuck off
[2:32:21] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:32:21] <kazadog> @Ginganinja4545 tbf half of that is because the 3ds controls suck shit
[2:32:22] <Hydrapissed> tigrex also just never stopped moviing lol
[2:32:22] <%CptCreampuff16> monster hunter genwunners wish thats all monster hunter was
[2:32:25] <Maids4lyfe> lol
[2:32:25] <Ardailec> Plesioyh Galactic hipcheck
[2:32:26] <%Monkeyweed21> I hope Plesioth never comes back
[2:32:28] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Bugnets and pickaxes BREAKING
[2:32:35] <stormhawk9891> Dude the old Dual Blade Demon moveset is ASS compared to now
[2:32:38] <DianaTheAscian> remember when mats and consumables used to share space in your pouch?
[2:32:41] <tgalloway001> 1st Generation shitboot, lets go!
[2:32:44] <%baka_sugoi> Brain off = FUN
[2:32:45] <%cvp5127> to have fun
[2:32:47] <+Resderp> Also, gathering ores with just one hit in this game is amazing.
[2:32:59] <%baka_sugoi> woolieFUN
[2:33:00] <Ginganinja4545> gotta mash that button to carve too
[2:33:01] <Hydrapissed> its plagues drugs
[2:33:03] <%TerpanderLux> i like fun :)
[2:33:04] <%Artoo__The_Me> I hope Galactic Hipcheck stays as the name. That made me laugh so much when I first saw it
[2:33:08] <+SilverDevilfish> "Why doesn't the first monster in low rank give me the same challenge as Fatalis" - Guy who's been playing MH for over a decade
[2:33:12] <DrkJP520> Plague, do you play Kirby games?
[2:33:13] <Cosairen> i honestly would go back to 4u if it got a remaster with just a bit of qol
[2:33:16] <DeathByPoke7> thats why i love risk of rain
[2:33:17] <%JobbedBone> farcry is fun and its easy as balls
[2:33:17] <%GinAndRoses> psaBig number
[2:33:19] <Oxybe> With MonHunt? see it. just chillax and bonk the monsters and take my time.
[2:33:29] <+MoaLaMoa> remember when people would compare how demon's souls feels to monster hunter and say they're super similar? LuL
[2:33:41] <Hydrapissed> iceborne was so chill lol
[2:33:42] <Aydarkzero> wut
[2:33:55] <buerdo> black dragons are not chill
[2:34:07] <%Dakuu75> I try pretty hard to land all my parries on Long Sworred
[2:34:09] <+rasend0ri> They are super similar
[2:34:19] <DianaTheAscian> its funny cause 95% of my monhun time has been solo
[2:34:23] <%Puhff> YEAH
[2:34:23] <%Monkeyweed21> Get a hunt in during your lunch break during your shitty office job
[2:34:24] <Cosairen> green plesioth hip check :(
[2:34:24] <+SilverDevilfish> Hip
[2:34:25] <+SilverDevilfish> check
[2:34:27] <+sunny_side_up> the way to avoid those moves is just to never be in the spot that it can hit you LUL
[2:34:28] <%AKW4RD_BUFF4LO> Waddup Pat? Waddup Chat?
[2:34:31] <Oxybe> Be IG. Be in the air. Oops, hitbox.
[2:34:35] <+sunny_side_up> shoutout to instant charges in old gen
[2:34:38] <%DashXero> Fuck that hip check
[2:34:39] <Zeif00> part of the reason I don't enjoy watching monster speed runs
[2:34:41] <@JustinianKnight> Tigrex's hitbox is kinda BS
[2:34:44] <+keiji_maede> Old fucking Rajang!!!
[2:34:45] <DianaTheAscian> FUCK THAT HIP
[2:34:49] <kazadog> ive legit seen people start to get nostalgiac about the hip check
[2:34:54] <+Grayhammatter> oh fuck that hip
[2:34:57] <fojidoj> Lunastra was just bullshit the monster
[2:34:58] <+Resderp> Nargacuga has some funky hitboxes.
[2:34:59] <%ForlornCarton> Ready to capture
[2:35:07] <@JustinianKnight> yea Narga too
[2:35:12] <+SilverDevilfish> Anjanath's tail world also reached up to the atmosphere
[2:35:14] <@JustinianKnight> that body type will hit you with NOTHING
[2:35:17] <buerdo> stories 2 made plesioths hit box a kinship attack
[2:35:18] <%DashXero> Nargacuga's hitboxes are perfect.
[2:35:28] <Cosairen> world lunastra can never come back like that and i would be happy
[2:35:31] <cpt_langosta> if eli starts turning off, you MUST turn him on as fast as you can
[2:35:38] <%dekkitout> @Cosairen psaCrazyhand
[2:35:39] <Darthkitten_Prime> Man, I heard Yian Garuga was hot garbage before it got an update in World
[2:35:47] <+sunny_side_up> garuga is purple not kutku
[2:35:48] <Cosairen> oh FUCK the kut ku tailwhip
[2:35:59] <%DashXero> YGG was a mofo.
[2:36:03] <+rasend0ri> If Monster Hunter had level design and regular enemies, would be the same game aside from the tone and setting.
[2:36:03] <+CheshirePierrot> yian garuga is so annoying
[2:36:04] <+Grayhammatter> purple? no
[2:36:04] <%Monkeyweed21> Escaton Judgement MIGHT have been too much
[2:36:05] <%RD_NX> Monster hunter has always felt chill but I never felt LESS chill than while fighting Alatreon in MH:W, still never beat that thing.
[2:36:14] <Hydrapissed> Insta snap and stun
[2:36:15] <artificiallynatural> garuga was like frame 2 startups in the old games wasn't it?
[2:36:18] <%Artoo__The_Me> That was actually awful
[2:36:29] <+SilverDevilfish> Any monster that makes a small movement with one part of their body but their whole body becomes the attack is infuriating
[2:36:31] <%CptCreampuff16> what about lunastra super?
[2:36:31] <@JustinianKnight> worst for me was Tigrex in World, hit me out of the air with nothing all the time
[2:36:38] <Hydrapissed> in rise they have a lot of insta bites in this its odd lol
[2:36:46] <%DashXero> @RD_NX To be fair, Alatreon in that game is the antithesis of a monster hunter fight.
[2:36:53] <%TerpanderLux> garuga was really fun in iceborne
[2:36:54] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt What about testarossa from World? You swing at the wrong time and he just explodes the planet and you can't do anything about it
[2:36:56] <+rasend0ri> Hell no
[2:37:00] <%pokefan9956> its more about knowing when it's safe to attack
[2:37:09] <kazadog> i would rather a game be easy than be difficult because youre fighting against the controls
[2:37:09] <%Artoo__The_Me> I mean, single player world Fatalis felt like that
[2:37:13] <Cosairen> tigrex has always been a mess imo i hate that stupid cat lizard
[2:37:13] <inpaladin> I feel like there was a lot of bullshit pre world but in world and rise it is very sparse
[2:37:26] <Darthkitten_Prime> @DashXero Totally agree. Easily my least favorite fight due to that.
[2:37:27] <%pokefan9956> learn the patterns. learn when it's safe to attack
[2:37:44] <%Bluwizard21> It took me a team of full randos with kanji for names to beat behemonth
[2:37:56] <+SilverDevilfish> Attack with the control stick fuck camera control Kappa
[2:38:10] <Cosairen> i will admit that theres a certain appeal to classic mh
[2:38:18] <%HarmonicArsenal> it's called Stockholm syndrome
[2:38:44] <%Artoo__The_Me> NO I HATE PEOPLE THAT DEFEND THE CLAW! My fingers hated the claw!
[2:38:45] <Ardailec> The Claw monkaS
[2:38:56] <DeathByPoke7> 3ds circle pad pro
[2:39:02] <Oxybe> Oooooh... the claw
[2:39:15] <Aydarkzero> one pouch
[2:39:24] <TacoSaIad> the original game doesn't even have the excuse of being old. It came out in 2004 and analog camera controls were already fairly standard.
[2:39:41] <ExpressNode> Phew breathe man its good for you
[2:39:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Pickaxes and whetstones used to be CONSUMABLE
[2:39:52] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Remember fucking PAINTBOMBS
[2:39:59] <%TerpanderLux> monkaS
[2:40:14] <%IamGrapes> omg paintbombs
[2:40:16] <%TerpanderLux> chjbDance
[2:40:21] <Hydrapissed> whats he doing
[2:40:23] <Hydrapissed> monkaS
[2:40:24] <inpaladin> I think the way rise's potions work is a perfect example of that @PatStaresAt
[2:40:25] <%Artoo__The_Me> Dog silencer?
[2:40:26] <%IamGrapes> waiving at the hot air balloon
[2:40:29] <Cosairen> i will never defend breakable pickaxes and nets im glad those are never coming back
[2:40:30] <+hodoumoudou> i mean the ultimate answer for why monster hunter doesn't prioritize balance the same way a dark souls does is just because playing anything solo at all is basically an unintended experience, you're supposed to do everything with a group except village
[2:40:30] <DrkJP520> So when are you streaming Monster Hunter 1?
[2:40:31] <+Grayhammatter> paintbombs were the worst
[2:40:31] <%notsoy> lol paint and having to loot nodes 3-5 times
[2:40:38] <cpt_langosta> let him it will fix her back
[2:40:40] <+rasend0ri> Is he finally gonna FIX the dog!?
[2:40:44] <+Leedle1116> 342weds32
[2:40:45] <%Artoo__The_Me> Dog silencer
[2:40:47] <%dekkitout> Laser Crab was deployed
[2:40:48] <Cosairen> paintballs LUL
[2:40:49] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Maybe dog the reason for Paiges back?
[2:40:51] <%HarmonicArsenal> paintbombs csbeastSetIn csbeastSetIn csbeastSetIn
[2:40:54] <Mister_McDerp> Bork Busted
[2:41:03] <Hydrapissed> they HAD THEM in guiding lands btw lol but they made them remove monsters lol
[2:41:03] <DianaTheAscian> I always liked paint bombs but i get why there gone
[2:41:07] <kazadog> remember how your character had to do a dumb pose after drinking a potion
[2:41:08] <Ginganinja4545> i will say i liked getting hit into the zone transition so you could safely heal up
[2:41:22] <fojidoj> I wouldn’t hate paintbombs near as much if the effect on the monster was permanent
[2:41:24] <%Artoo__The_Me> Function is very different in stories
[2:41:25] <+ALazo> I kind of miss the hunt and finding the monster. Having them just be in the map makes me a little sad
[2:41:32] <%Brassnarwhal> i also liked paint bombs as a functionality but i wish they didnt take a pouch slot
[2:41:33] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Paintball are cool in low rank, but quickly become redudant
[2:41:39] <tgalloway001> Gunner Paint Shot, why I main gunner gen 1
[2:41:45] <tgalloway001> and gen 2
[2:41:57] <%YakumoYomi> Nah, I just used Psychoserum until I memorized the monster's sleeping location. In Gen/GU, I just played a Prowler
[2:42:02] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Eventually you wouldn't lose them cause you knew where they would go.
[2:42:06] <Hydrapissed> in world they had that with tracks sorta lol
[2:42:07] <Ginganinja4545> i do miss the "find the monster" aspect.  world had it pretty good
[2:42:14] <Zeif00> it's cute
[2:42:30] <Darthkitten_Prime> I feel like they went a little too far with Rise in having the monster on the map from the start.
[2:42:42] <kazadog> make a cabela game with big dragons
[2:42:47] <%CptCreampuff16> world did that and everyone got mad at it
[2:42:49] <%Brassnarwhal> @hydrapissed they replaced the paint bomb with the seeker flies or whatever which is what the tracks are using
[2:42:59] <Radioactivetaco9> MH3 had that too
[2:43:04] <Cosairen> it is
[2:43:12] <cpt_langosta> is sure hope there are no x in this game that'd be a bad time for everyone
[2:43:13] <%BackflipCharm> MH3 had it to a limited extent
[2:43:28] <Cosairen> tracks sucked
[2:43:33] <Ardailec> It is, but it's basically just "Got damnit I need money, Lets go to Minesurge lava caverns"
[2:43:34] <%JobbedBone> theres a pokemon go style basketball game where you have to go hunt down hoops challenges
[2:43:36] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> They also still had time limits pre world
[2:43:42] <%Deft_Thought> World had a lotta preamble
[2:43:44] <%TerpanderLux> im cringing bro
[2:43:54] <%JobbedBone> and its sponsored by howie mandel
[2:43:54] <DeathByPoke7> i just realized theres no tracks in rise
[2:44:10] <%Monkeyweed21> also the tracking mechanic was made as a REPLACEMENT for paintballs
[2:44:13] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> GS has a kick
[2:44:14] <%Artoo__The_Me> I’m not defending the paintballs, but after hunting the same monster so many times, you’ll learn their areas that they would travel to
[2:44:15] <%RD_NX> I liked the world bugs
[2:44:18] <%dekkitout> Wide, long, or normal shelling?
[2:44:20] <artificiallynatural> guard-slash on sns
[2:44:21] <%FacetiousAF> kill bnuuy
[2:44:22] <kazadog> i wish capcom actually tried to make most of those playstyles actually worth it
[2:44:26] <Hydrapissed> Gun lance is perfect for that plague is high u got 3 diff play styles
[2:44:35] <+AWr00tBear> Great sword kick
[2:44:36] <artificiallynatural> like they added guard-point to the guardslash but it's still basically useless
[2:44:39] <+hodoumoudou> all three shell types are good in rise but they're not always, is his point
[2:44:45] <Cosairen> build diversity is good?
[2:45:07] <%YakumoYomi> Normal, Wide, and Long shelling, on top of playstyles like "Slapstick" and "Fullburst"
[2:45:11] <+rasend0ri> Is that a real question?
[2:45:13] <%Artoo__The_Me> I still hope the boomerang weapons happens one day
[2:45:14] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> What could they even add to the weapon roster at this point (cept the frontier stuff)
[2:45:17] <%dekkitout> Slaplance, charged shelling, fullburst? Pick your poison, but only one's good :3
[2:45:19] <Hydrapissed> Gunlance in rise is fantastic dont ruin it with make it a gun fucking light bow gun and heavy bow gun are a snore fest lol
[2:45:19] <cpt_langosta> eli loves his analsis
[2:45:23] <%JobbedBone> literally his moniker LUL
[2:45:27] <%Brassnarwhal> the fact that multiple people defended the paintball by describing how they eventually didn't need to use the paintball is wild, i hate this burger but once I'm done eating it i dont have to eat the bruger anymore. thanks
[2:45:27] <Chaos_Aether> X
[2:45:28] <Sakhasa> What does the blastblight effect on pat do?
[2:45:34] <Aussie_Manny> mmmm
[2:45:35] <TacoSaIad> A man called "plague of gripes" likes to gripe? People are surprised?
[2:45:35] <Aussie_Manny> MMMMMMMMMM
[2:45:36] <Cosairen> full burst gl feels so good now with blast dash
[2:45:36] <TheeRabbi> plague loves analcysts
[2:45:44] <%BackflipCharm> "Used to be"
[2:45:49] <+SilverDevilfish> "used to be"
[2:45:51] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Use?
[2:45:56] <Aussie_Manny> @PatStaresAt mmmmm
[2:45:58] <Aussie_Manny> @PatStaresAt MMMMMMMMMM
[2:46:05] <%Brassnarwhal> blast blight explodes after time, hellfire explodes after time or when you get hit
[2:46:11] <$realm_forge> Used to be lol
[2:46:14] <%Artoo__The_Me> @sakhasa Normally just blows up, but with pat’s current armor raises attack essentially
[2:46:18] <GarbageNirvana> I got in at Freedom Unite, shit was w i l d back then
[2:46:45] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Remember insta charges LUL
[2:46:45] <$SGrim> Didn't this conversation already happen?
[2:46:47] <Sakhasa> @Artoo__The_Me Gotcha, thanks!
[2:46:48] <Cosairen> 4u to world was a TRIP
[2:46:52] <%dekkitout> Good old Harold
[2:47:08] <+Iwantscandy> Iwantscandy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 41 months! Wow 40 Months huh
[2:47:15] <+SilverDevilfish> Elemental Damage
[2:47:20] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Remember when GS could clean house because monster turning was really exploitable LUL
[2:47:37] <Hydrapissed> Dauntless TRIED LOL
[2:47:44] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt true veteren's don't love the house, they love surviving the fire, and want everyone to know they survived the fire. SOurce: I started at 1.
[2:47:50] <+lordericter> God Eater
[2:47:51] <%JobbedBone> theres a sick one on the PSP
[2:47:57] <Mattais88> god eater
[2:47:57] <%DashXero> Dauntless, God Eater, Freedom Wars...
[2:47:59] <%BackflipCharm> Dauntless tries very hard
[2:47:59] <%baka_sugoi> dauntless was fun
[2:48:02] <Cosairen> remember sheath control gs builds in g rank 4u
[2:48:02] <%OrangeMDT> Oh yeah, Dauntless
[2:48:05] <%DashXero> Toukiden
[2:48:06] <%BackflipCharm> SOul Survivor
[2:48:10] <+Roivas1991> Soul Sacrifice.
[2:48:11] <BinaryShuffle> Man I feel bad for Dauntless
[2:48:12] <%YakumoYomi> God Eater, Toukiden, Soul Sacrifice, Ragnarok Odyssey, Freedom Wars, etc.
[2:48:13] <@JustinianKnight> Dragons Dogma, sorta
[2:48:15] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Dauntless is alright
[2:48:15] <+Jaromero435> How is Tokiden? It seemed alright from a demo
[2:48:24] <%MrP33Ps> Freedom Wars was fun
[2:48:24] <%BackflipCharm> Soul SACRIFICE right
[2:48:25] <$StormingRLP> God Eater is fun. I finished up 3's story. No new game yet.
[2:48:28] <+CheshirePierrot> I like Soul Sacrifice
[2:48:32] <+Jack8274> I'm amazed at the dedicated God Eater Communnity
[2:48:35] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Dragons dogma as warrior
[2:48:48] <%YakumoYomi> @Jaromero435 It's probably the closest to MH, but the combat isn't as "weighty"
[2:48:50] <%Artoo__The_Me> They stand out in aspects
[2:48:53] <TacoSaIad> Similar to soulslikes.
[2:48:59] <Hydrapissed> the end game fights in mon hun are always to tight
[2:49:02] <Hydrapissed> and other games miss it
[2:49:10] <stormhawk9891> I'm amazed God Eater did as well as it did, and I like God Eater
[2:49:13] <%Brassnarwhal> the same problem with mortal shell right?
[2:49:33] <%Monkeyweed21> you need both excellent movesets and great monster design
[2:49:38] <%DashXero> Or all the WoW clones.
[2:49:39] <knight_verse> The Gunlance should be called the GunHalberd... because that's what it is.
[2:49:47] <Darthkitten_Prime> Or pokemon
[2:49:49] <%BackflipCharm> I've tried to play God Eater like 3 times and I just can't quite wrap my head around it. It feels so loose and slippery compared to MH's firm tightness
[2:49:50] <%YakumoYomi> Soul Sacrifice Delta stands toe-to-toe with MH, in my opinion
[2:49:53] <%Cozy90> This is how i feel about tank controls.
[2:49:55] <Cleric4gg> The appeal of jank
[2:50:11] <%Artoo__The_Me> Honestly DS and MH really are hand in hand when it comes to the industry
[2:50:16] <TrollKing96> So Homer was right when he said never try?
[2:50:22] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> The monster designs I find are just way too generic in the clone-likes compared to the main games
[2:50:32] <+Jack8274> The flaws are for creating a feeling of nostalgia
[2:50:34] <GarbageNirvana> Dauntless could have been a decent one if it wasn't so goddamn basic
[2:50:40] <%kyh9> Did Paige sign off?
[2:50:54] <%bevyrage> dauntless also launched too early to not get blown out by world
[2:50:54] <artificiallynatural> @kyh9 she taking a break cuz back hurt
[2:51:08] <Cosairen> nothing else has a real good monster designer is one of the biggest issues
[2:51:22] <%bevyrage> they were wanting to release it later but after their beta was announced and world was revealed they jumped their timeline forward
[2:51:46] <+sunny_side_up> mh is very weighty
[2:51:47] <%TerpanderLux> god eater feels so bland
[2:51:57] <%Artoo__The_Me> The weight of hits matter
[2:51:59] <GarbageNirvana> It was gonna have its lunch ate regardless
[2:52:04] <TacoSaIad> Or Lords of the Fallen which though "people like Souls cause it's slow" and they made it too slow.
[2:52:10] <DeathByPoke7> thats the worst for me
[2:52:14] <kazadog> this is why i hate mmos
[2:52:17] <%kyh9> Feels like you're fighting with NERF weapons
[2:52:18] <Cosairen> lots of lack of hitstop yeah
[2:52:21] <DaKnightWarrior> Agreed
[2:52:23] <%cvp5127> but pat you play an mmo
[2:52:28] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> One of the best moments in any of these games is meeting the main invader monster for the first time
[2:52:32] <%TerpanderLux> downcoming
[2:52:33] <cpt_langosta> homecoming
[2:52:36] <%kyh9> GOD I AM SO EXCITED FOR STRANGER OF PARADISE
[2:52:39] <Hydrapissed> OH BOI down coming
[2:52:40] <%CopperTucker> Homecoming
[2:52:49] <%akss421> Family family
[2:52:50] <%Cozy90> home puring
[2:52:55] <Cleric4gg> bUt He WaS a SoLdIeR
[2:53:01] <Cleric4gg> LUL
[2:53:08] <%CopperTucker> I always liked that detail honestly.
[2:53:08] <%Cozy90> down puring
[2:53:17] <%Cozy90> oh my god i cant type
[2:53:17] <keohtv> (But he wasnt)
[2:53:22] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> TIME FOR ARMY MAN
[2:53:28] <%BackflipCharm> Another example of this is the western made Earth Defense Force LUL
[2:53:28] <Hydrapissed> WHEN THEY gave him actual combos
[2:53:31] <Hydrapissed> and I laffed my dick off
[2:53:47] <%akss421> but the twist destroys that
[2:53:47] <Hydrapissed> u knife fight a NURSE lol
[2:53:51] <Hydrapissed> I died inside
[2:53:51] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> You'd think they'd base the setting of of war PTSD but nope
[2:54:17] <%Agami23> i just got back, are you guys ranting about alex shepherd again?
[2:54:23] <Hydrapissed> It killed the whole horror
[2:54:28] <Hydrapissed> u could stun lock bosses lol
[2:54:30] <cpt_langosta> the best way to be good at combat is to think you have combat training when you actually don't
[2:54:34] <%TerpanderLux> ahhhh!
[2:54:39] <Hydrapissed> with ur dumb ass link combo
[2:54:45] <%akss421> remeber how you fought humans in that game
[2:54:51] <GarbageNirvana> Can't wait to see Woolie get his hands on that one
[2:54:54] <TacoSaIad> I like big glowing buttons in my atmospheric horror games.
[2:54:56] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Is it ever explained why yhe nurses are in homecoming?
[2:55:02] <cs0402196> combo'ing god to death
[2:55:14] <Hydrapissed> did plague like the ds1 dlc?
[2:55:17] <Darthkitten_Prime> If you're going to give your player good controls and powerful tools, the enemies need to be able to keep up with the player.
[2:55:38] <%patriotrenegade> Fair he says.
[2:55:40] <%CopperTucker> Bloodborne clicks with me more than Dark Souls does. It fits my playstyle more.
[2:55:47] <%CopperTucker> quick + aggressive
[2:56:01] <artoflec> yeah bloodborne plays way better than dark souls even though its faster
[2:56:03] <%Agami23> i really really like demon souls
[2:56:11] <%kyh9> Souls games only ever seem to focus on the progression system instead of the actual gameplay.  Because Dark Souls gameplay pulls a lot more from Monster Hunter and most devs havent played Monster Hunter
[2:56:14] <Cosairen> lords of the fallen feels weighty but floaty at the same time
[2:56:23] <+hodoumoudou> nioh 2 is the only really good "soulslike" and it's because it basically isn't one anymore lmao
[2:56:30] <artoflec> dark souls 1 doesnt feel weighty though, the animations are kinda shit LUL
[2:56:34] <%D00msDayDan> every time someone brings up lords of the fallen i'm reminded that i never finished either The Surge
[2:56:38] <DeathByPoke7> oops all strength builds
[2:56:42] <faldin> it seems like a lot of dark souls like games dont understand what made dark souls good
[2:56:45] <%CopperTucker> I'm a twin blades main because I just want fast in MonHun
[2:57:16] <artoflec> Nioh 1 and 2 are so wildly different, they don't feel like the same comparison anymore.
[2:57:58] <DeathByPoke7> LUL
[2:58:17] <%TerpanderLux> 😡
[2:58:21] <Hydrapissed> Charged attacks for bosses Clap
[2:58:26] <+SilverDevilfish> 2 did that on regular enemies
[2:58:30] <%Agami23> thats what made me hate dark souls 3 convergence. they put a sekiro boss in at the end that just feels shitty
[2:58:36] <TacoSaIad> I think matthewmatosis talked about that in one of his videos.
[2:58:37] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Doesn't that one boss do that in the network test
[2:58:39] <%YakumoYomi> Dark Souls 2 loves those 180 degree tracking overheads
[2:58:44] <+rasend0ri> Yup…
[2:58:45] <+SilverDevilfish> The godamn Turtle Knight that would walk at you for 5 seconds before swining
[2:58:49] <%Cozy90> I cant stand that. In convergence the dancer one is so obnoxious
[2:58:51] <+SilverDevilfish> ^swinging
[2:58:54] <+rasend0ri> Look at Manus
[2:58:54] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Play through Convergence Till you get to The Pontiff Sulivahyne and you'll see why you want this mechanic in souls games
[2:58:54] <%akss421> nameless king
[2:58:58] <Hydrapissed> hell hold up fire hand then poke u with purple hand lol
[2:59:01] <Hydrapissed> sullvan Clap
[2:59:11] <%strakillias> They also did the twirl alot as well
[2:59:17] <%G_Thunders> Yeah the Elden Ring boss tracks you with that attack and doesn’t even swing at all if you circle around him for too long
[2:59:21] <Hydrapissed> most fast bosses u parry him lol
[2:59:29] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Pontiff is like gundyr beta
[2:59:32] <Hydrapissed> and heavy weapons stagger the fuck outa him
[2:59:39] <%Agami23> also pontiff in dark souls convergence is also annoyingly tough
[2:59:49] <+Jaromero435> This one weird trick, monsters hate it
[2:59:49] <Psyramics> flinch lock
[2:59:50] <%BackflipCharm> World also had some of the most busted builds I've ever seen.
[2:59:56] <Hydrapissed> HOLD THEM DOWN AND FUCK
[2:59:56] <Radioactivetaco9> kelbi bow :)
[2:59:57] <Hydrapissed> Clap
[3:00:06] <Cosairen> like breaking zinogres arms
[3:00:07] <+Akizea> HAME RUNS
[3:00:11] <Hydrapissed> 144p all naked with HEROICS and then it dis
[3:00:23] <DaKnightWarrior> The classic
[3:00:34] <Hydrapissed> fatalis killed in 1 min with 4 guns lol
[3:00:42] <%CptCreampuff16> we need more plague and pat content
[3:00:42] <Holycow8498> 144p naked runs on Alatreon  sleep bombs Kappa
[3:00:49] <+righteousjam> Oh shit plague of gripes hell yeah
[3:00:59] <Shwepie> Beating on the monster's legs makes them trip a lot.

[3:01:17] <%TerpanderLux> melvin
[3:01:17] <%vehementvadr> marget
[3:01:17] <Darkrenai> Bro i just want Elden Ring RIGHT NOW
[3:01:17] <knight_verse> I'm liking this special episode of the podcast.
[3:01:17] <%shurtal> fell omen?
[3:01:18] <cpt_langosta> melvin
[3:01:19] <Darkrenai> Melvin huh?
[3:01:20] <Hydrapissed> magrid?
[3:01:24] <Hydrapissed> marget yah
[3:01:25] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> He doesn't overuse it because its pretty much just a change attack to punish defensive people
[3:01:25] <James_Quivers> Brother of the joker?
[3:01:28] <Cosairen> margit
[3:01:29] <+AWr00tBear> Team Darkside(YouTube channel) killed Valstrax in 3 great sword hits.
[3:01:31] <+croutonian> Margit
[3:01:34] <%G_Thunders> Melvussy
[3:01:39] <%Bluwizard21> Ah yes, Marge the Simpson
[3:01:43] <Hydrapissed> they are getting better at the boss stuff
[3:01:51] <Holycow8498> Marge the simpson
[3:01:56] <%Brassnarwhal> Margussy the Fussy
[3:02:17] <Darkrenai> Oh yeah for sure
[3:02:18] <+rasend0ri> They can’t all be winners however
[3:02:32] <%Bluwizard21> @Hydrapissed Untill you get to that one goddamn puzzle boss they demand be in the game that serves no purpose but for you to run at it 90 times to figure out what the fuck to do
[3:02:32] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:02:34] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> So who wants to bet secret new map in elden ring lol
[3:02:34] <%Brassnarwhal> they have also explicitly said that it's more accessible
[3:02:36] <Aussie_Manny> What will the side content of Elden Ring be, I wonder?
[3:02:43] <@Velyndra> i think pats game is bugged, this isn't the standard lbg move set
[3:02:45] <@Velyndra> weird
[3:02:47] <Hydrapissed> @Bluwizard21 well yah lol
[3:02:52] <Darkrenai> Go explore dude lol lmao
[3:02:55] <%Brassnarwhal> @aussie_manny most of the game
[3:02:58] <Darkrenai> -Fromsoft
[3:03:00] <Hydrapissed> They also have pet summons to use
[3:03:02] <cpt_langosta> you WILL be sucked
[3:03:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> get number go up
[3:03:03] <%Agami23> elden ring has magic builds and stuff, right?"
[3:03:06] <Hydrapissed> as well as multi
[3:03:25] <TacoSaIad> I'm ok with them toning down the difficulty. I love Sekiro but I did start to worry they'd go too far if they kept trying to top themselves.
[3:03:27] <Hydrapissed> yah it does
[3:03:28] <%Brassnarwhal> @agami23 yes, but pyromancy seems to have been folded into miracles
[3:03:33] <Cosairen> elden ring comes out the 25th right?
[3:03:36] <Aussie_Manny> Statistically stronger? That's the best kind of stronger!
[3:04:06] <Hydrapissed> it feels like castlevania to me
[3:04:14] <Hydrapissed> well the dark souls games did
[3:04:18] <Lagzlot> Souls games are nothing on the From difficulty meter. Cookie And Cream is some absolute bullshit on the higher levels, then there are all the mech games.
[3:04:19] <%Brassnarwhal> @cosairen yes, i have the elden ring countdown page bookmarked, 19 days left
[3:04:32] <%Agami23> someone will make a boss rush mod
[3:04:32] <Cosairen> based
[3:04:36] <%Bluwizard21> I just hope Elden Ring encourages item use, cause I'd gather all this shit and never use 99% of it
[3:04:41] <Aussie_Manny> I really liked the things between bosses in Bloodborne. So I don't just want a boss rush game!
[3:05:13] <%YakumoYomi> @Lagzlot Oh yeah. Old Armored Core games have some BULLSHIT when you fight other mech pilots
[3:05:13] <Hydrapissed> I bet the omega try hard places will be underground lol
[3:05:18] <%Artoo__The_Me> That just sounds good
[3:05:20] <Aussie_Manny> Which Dark Souls does Elden Ring feel most like?
[3:05:20] <%notsoy> dark souls kiwami?
[3:05:26] <%Brassnarwhal> i have the consumable goblins so i hope crafting gives a lot of consumables or else im never gonna use them
[3:05:28] <Holycow8498> The Souls saga HD edition?
[3:05:28] <DeathByPoke7> dark souls greatest hits volume 2
[3:05:30] <%cade_calrayn> so alt universe Souls trilogy, fresh enough that it's new
[3:05:37] <cpt_langosta> not to mention all the poison swamps
[3:05:55] <%Brassnarwhal> @aussie_manny it's so similar to 3 that it shares some bugs and gameplay quirks with 3
[3:06:11] <Hydrapissed> ya see that werewolf bear pat?
[3:06:20] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Are made builds gonna be good in elden ring?
[3:06:20] <+rasend0ri> That’s what FromSoft has been doing it ages
[3:06:27] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> *mage*
[3:06:44] <TacoSaIad> One day I'll finish a King's Field game. One day.
[3:06:48] <%Brassnarwhal> @kobi_robi_tobi they seem to be making magic both better and more accessible with the ashes of war
[3:06:48] <Hydrapissed> also ZERO ULTRA WEPS
[3:06:59] <Hydrapissed> ULTRA WEPS not found so I BET THEY busted
[3:07:12] <%Agami23> i think my favorite weird fromsoft network test thing is when the undead chariot was named "silver chariot" in darksouls 2's network test
[3:07:38] <Holycow8498> @Agami23 Hmm?
[3:07:42] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Fuk that
[3:07:51] <Latija> next stream idea
[3:07:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> I don't think I've ever played a game with a truly large map that wasn't buggy as shit
[3:07:56] <%G_Thunders> Oof
[3:07:57] <%dekkitout> Guarantee there's gonna be broken collisions
[3:08:08] <DaKnightWarrior> NotLikeThis
[3:08:08] <Aussie_Manny> God help you.
[3:08:25] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Hollow knight had a bug where the secret final boss had a guaranteed kill bug
[3:08:26] <%RD_NX> Thats why all their games have their own version of the dark-sign
[3:08:30] <Darkrenai> BANNED
[3:08:30] <Explodincatz> some people just love CBT gameplay
[3:08:31] <%cade_calrayn> hence why I'm gonna play Horizon for a week or 3 and give Elden Ring some time to patch
[3:08:41] <%Agami23> @Holycow8498 in the network test for darksouls 2, the undead chariot was named after a jojo stand instead. "silver chariot". then in the full release they changed it
[3:08:44] <Aussie_Manny> I'm assuming stream?
[3:08:58] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> That's why homeward bones exist
[3:09:03] <%dekkitout> Honeytunnel blastwaste games (open world games) are made of problems/ -Tim Rogers
[3:09:10] <%Brassnarwhal> @kobi_robi_tobi well i guarantee that a bug will die every time you fight the final boss soo
[3:09:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> clip into a wall and the game autosaves
[3:09:29] <%cade_calrayn> if he gets it early he's gonna record it
[3:09:32] <+TheKeysmash> i hope 50 hours in we learn that its secretly a sequel to eternal ring
[3:09:32] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> @brassnarwhal cease NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:09:36] <neraren> "Hypothetically"
[3:09:38] <Aussie_Manny> For the platform! 2020Forward
[3:09:49] <Latija> blood for the blood god!
[3:09:59] <DeathByPoke7> like dmc5
[3:10:00] <%strakillias> Are you gonna do elden ring whenever the fuck you feel like how you did with FF14?
[3:10:04] <%Brassnarwhal> just wait until i actually light my blunt kobi
[3:10:14] <%CopperTucker> 50 hours into Eldin Ring and it's an Armored Core sequel
[3:10:51] <@Ranryu692> it was definitely disappointing when that happened with DMCV
[3:11:08] <%RD_NX> Low-speed internet is totally one of the reasons there are youtubers who do video-essays rather than stream or do lets plays
[3:11:30] <Aussie_Manny> Content. brodayGimme
[3:11:40] <cpt_langosta> pomegranate
[3:11:48] <%Monkeyweed21> calling it now: Elden Ring is a prequel to EDF
[3:11:55] <%Bluwizard21> That's the best part of some streamers
[3:12:11] <%Brassnarwhal> id love to watch plague wander around getting mad at elden ring for 80 hours
[3:12:15] <Aussie_Manny> ...BUT
[3:12:22] <@Ranryu692> if you suddenly stop talking about Elden Ring entirely, you probably have it and are under embargo
[3:12:23] <neraren> Or just be patient and dont play it until the embargo lifts?
[3:12:27] <ammobasket> you're probably very tired from all the work stress
[3:12:29] <%bevyrage> [itsamystery.mp3]
[3:12:30] <%cade_calrayn> "Paige is broken see you in a week"
[3:12:32] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[3:12:38] <%TerpanderLux> no
[3:12:42] <Cosairen> a secret project?
[3:12:43] <DeathByPoke7> zangief ate your shoe cant stream
[3:12:48] <BinaryShuffle> What a jive sucker
[3:12:48] <%Brassnarwhal> @neraren we all love waiting til we can be spoiled lol
[3:12:50] <%bevyrage> wait why does that turn into a link
[3:12:50] <%akss421> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[3:12:53] <%HarmonicArsenal> nemuLUL
[3:12:54] <%G_Thunders> GRRM said in an interview that elden ring is a sequel to dark souls. Would be hilarious if that was actually a twist in the game and not just him misspeaking
[3:12:56] <%SaiyanShoto> You could be doing both
[3:13:02] <Aussie_Manny> lmao
[3:13:04] <+rasend0ri> What a jackass
[3:13:10] <Slim_Lipid> why are yuo doing the light bowgun quest with greatsword PunOko
[3:13:13] <%CopperTucker> lol
[3:13:16] <akitanito> LUL
[3:13:22] <neraren> You just said getting it would kill your main source of income for two weeks lol
[3:13:22] <%CptCreampuff16> is peach done for today?
[3:13:25] <%bevyrage> @G_Thunders or a mistranslation
[3:13:26] <%Brassnarwhal> i didn't want to dogpile i didnt expect pat to call them out rip
[3:13:29] <cpt_langosta> but what if the back of the box says "please sit on me daddy"
[3:13:42] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> The fog gates are golden because of the Lord vessel LUL
[3:13:44] <%kyh9> Do an E3 and pretend to play the game while pre-recorded footage is actually playing
[3:13:51] <DianaTheAscian> me
[3:13:53] <%akss421> thankfully I dont care because im gonna be playing it blind and avoid the subreddit and youtube for a week
[3:13:56] <%G_Thunders> @bevyrage it’s a video interview where he’s speaking english
[3:13:58] <%SaiyanShoto> Max has super strong will in that he gets a game early but waits until it’s releases to everyone else
[3:14:13] <%Brassnarwhal> @kyh9 *not actual live stream footage*
[3:14:14] <%bevyrage> ah that's more understandable then
[3:14:16] <%cvp5127> DO IT
[3:14:19] <%CopperTucker> good shit
[3:14:20] <Aussie_Manny> PRETEND TO PLAY LUL
[3:14:21] <Aussie_Manny> OMG
[3:14:21] <%RD_NX> scandalous . . .
[3:14:24] <@Ranryu692> you'd have to smoke a blunt in the middle of it to do the true Snoop Dogg
[3:14:26] <Slim_Lipid> just like Snoop PogBones
[3:14:26] <%strakillias> That would be really funny
[3:14:26] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[3:14:27] <DeathByPoke7> didnt snoop dog do that
[3:14:37] <Aussie_Manny> FAKE REACTION LUL
[3:14:39] <%Dakuu75> Ah yes, the snoop Dog approach
[3:14:40] <%SaiyanShoto> You should do that! LUL LUL
[3:14:42] <%kyh9> You're holding a Wii Controller and commentating on your old gameplay
[3:14:45] <%sendart> ye old speed run scam LUL
[3:14:46] <+A0N33> Do it for like 5 minutes or osmethign and then ask either Geif or past Pat to take over
[3:14:49] <%Agami23> pre-record yourself moving the controller around like your playing and have it loop
[3:14:55] <+dougrayman> oh shit, plague is here
[3:14:59] <%Brassnarwhal> @dakuu75 i was gonna say that
[3:15:00] <%akss421> WEED3

[3:15:36] <storytayl0r> Hyperspace Tackle
[3:15:36] <%CptCreampuff16> did pat finish stories 2?
[3:15:38] <Jim_Placebo> Hyperspace Tackle
[3:15:39] <shevan123> superstar tackle or something
[3:15:41] <BlueSpartan119> hyperspace tackle iirc on green plesioth
[3:15:43] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Yeah plesioth has it LUL LUL
[3:15:43] <%Brassnarwhal> @cosairen who?
[3:15:48] <+2DSuperiority> Tsukino my wife
[3:15:49] <%bevyrage> plesioth's THICCcheck
[3:15:52] <%kyh9> SUPER MEGA TIME BENDING HIP CHECK
[3:16:04] <+rasend0ri> Phantasm strike
[3:16:13] <%AlteisenReiseZ> That is a francophone crime and a half
[3:16:16] <%RD_NX> Oh that's why he had the knife, He just wanted some bread
[3:16:17] <%AlteisenReiseZ> HE STOLE MY LE BAGUETTE
[3:16:24] <Aussie_Manny> Big number! 2020Forward Big number! 2020Forward
[3:16:26] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> So in frontier, the ultra (zenith) plesioth has a double hip check as an ultimate move LUL
[3:16:28] <Cosairen> @Brassnarwhal some E clown
[3:16:30] <%cade_calrayn> the Paige is broken
[3:16:39] <%Brassnarwhal> does eli use earthshaker?
[3:16:40] <+Ricky_Rexx> I was gone for a bit did Paige get so lost she left the game?
[3:16:48] <%Sotetsu> I hope Paige feels better soon :(
[3:16:54] <%shurtal> Paige's sleep schedule is convoluted
[3:17:16] <%Brassnarwhal> @cosairen weird i thought twitch was just the platform that pat runs to talk to his 800 closest friends
[3:17:17] <%SaiyanShoto> I feel like both of your sleep schedules are always fucked
[3:17:31] <kazadog> finally beat the new valstrax event that boy hurts
[3:17:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> Precognizent
[3:17:39] <%walternatorz> Paige is also a medical case study unto herself.
[3:17:42] <%Sotetsu> I mean, they took a 3am IQ test.
[3:17:48] <%shurtal> Valstrax still sounds like herpes medication
[3:17:48] <%TerpanderLux> baggy
[3:17:59] <@Ranryu692> @Sotetsu *6am
[3:18:02] <%SaiyanShoto> I blame the 6am IQ test
[3:18:07] <%Brassnarwhal> @kazadog oh god i have to fight valstrax again for my pc save
[3:18:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> Paise is ‘Medically Nope.’
[3:18:32] <kazadog> @Brassnarwhal they just added a new souped up version this week good luck
[3:18:42] <%Sotetsu> Exploration is the best part of souls games.
[3:18:52] <Aussie_Manny> There's gonna be SOOO much wandering in Elden Ring!
[3:18:58] <raineedaydreams> a lie?
[3:18:59] <%Brassnarwhal> @kazadog oh god why
[3:19:03] <Aussie_Manny> I wanna see some cool vistas and stuff.
[3:19:05] <%CalderGaming> a lie? i missed this revelation
[3:19:05] <Psyramics> i dropped off of hollow knight cause to get any additional endings needed fighting bosses and only bosses
[3:19:16] <Ghufufin> new vegas does have amazing writing tbf
[3:19:18] <%Agami23> nothing is cooler than looking at the moon in bloodborne through the game
[3:19:20] <%SaiyanShoto> Until it’s another poison swamp
[3:19:27] <Shwepie> Exploration is what made Dark Souls good.
[3:19:30] <fojidoj> The exploration kinda stressing me out because I find myself less enjoying it and more trying to remember routes and where everything else. Maybe I need to turn my brain off
[3:19:35] <%LouieRouie> It's real to me, dammit!
[3:19:40] <%cade_calrayn> god
[3:19:42] <cpt_langosta> shamisen
[3:19:48] <%cade_calrayn> can you imagine the shortcut porn in Elden Ring
[3:19:48] <%RD_NX> My favorite part of souls is walking up to enemy jobbers and doing the cool thing, skipping through a dark souls game is like not fighting crowds of jobbers in the Arkham games
[3:19:55] <%Brassnarwhal> @kazadog might have to finish my heal horn build otherwise people will just triple faint on me, i isually play full damage diablos horn
[3:19:57] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> @psyramics There's actually a unique ending tied to a hidden side quest, but it requires you to do godmaster at some point
[3:20:18] <%blastyoboots> The shrine statues
[3:20:18] <Aussie_Manny> No more boss routes?
[3:20:26] <%Brassnarwhal> @patstaresat stakes of marika are respawn anchors
[3:20:28] <kazadog> @Brassnarwhal well this was the first fight that made me feel like i had to switch to a defensive petalace
[3:20:32] <Shwepie> @Psyramics Just for the GodHome DLC. Super ignore it and just watch some videos on youtube.
[3:20:41] <TheRealNumberJ42> that's nice running past a bunch of enemies to the boss was just annoying
[3:20:43] <Aussie_Manny> So it's like Lady Maria, where the lantern was right outside the door.
[3:20:45] <%blastyoboots> The checkpoints in front of boss rooms for just respawning that aren’t grace
[3:20:46] <+GeneralGray8> Pat did you see that there's apparently a feint move on some weapons in elden ring?
[3:21:00] <+Voldra> Stakes of Marika - especially for the open world bosses
[3:21:03] <%Brassnarwhal> @kazadog bro I've never used anything besides demon petalace
[3:21:14] <kazadog> @Brassnarwhal same lol
[3:21:17] <%sporeian94> Man I'm so hyped for Elden Ring I'm trying to play bloodborne AND HOLY FUCK THE LOADING IT'S SO BAD
[3:21:27] <kazadog> @Brassnarwhal though i might just be bad
[3:21:38] <DeathByPoke7> like pinwheel
[3:21:49] <Cosairen> demon petalace is the only one worth using unless you use bow
[3:21:54] <%Brassnarwhal> @generalgray8 it's like the special kick replacements from previous games, like curved sword backstep or rwpier backstep that replace the kick
[3:21:54] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Cathedral wards great
[3:21:55] <Aussie_Manny> Ha ha HAHA ha
[3:21:57] <+Big_Bang_Blitz_> bloodborne loads much faster in the psx version
[3:21:59] <%sporeian94> Paarl gave me more trouble this time around than I care to admit...
[3:21:59] <Psyramics> @Psyramics no? i needed a bunch of some resource to get into the last zone and the best way to get it was bosses
[3:22:01] <Aussie_Manny> i get it
[3:22:05] <faldin> catharsis for a hard zone
[3:22:11] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Honestly best starting area

[3:22:18] <%FacetiousAF> tank da pepoh

[3:22:39] <%Puhff> LUL
[3:22:44] <%Brassnarwhal> @kazadog honestly the thing that screws my runs up most is taking sonic barrier, people just eat damage with barrier up and die cause they don't get atunned

[3:23:38] <TheRealNumberJ42> in before manufacturing error
[3:23:40] <Aussie_Manny> If it's gone gold, it's coming now.
[3:23:41] <%walternatorz> you're understimating crazy talk
[3:23:43] <%cade_calrayn> break into your local gamestop
