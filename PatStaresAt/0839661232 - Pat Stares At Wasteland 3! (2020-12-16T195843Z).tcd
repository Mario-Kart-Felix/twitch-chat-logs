[0:09:16] <%Daxalog> @PatStaresAt Before you play I think you should know this tip. Becareful about reviving people who had/have DOTS on them. They might immediatly fall down again and get another debuff.

[0:10:46] <tanarath> Pat is always cheating
[0:10:52] <Unnoble> wasteland 3 looked really fun been debating buying it
[0:10:53] <%Daxalog> I didnt take those both. I regret it
[0:10:54] <Monkeyweed21> Update on a podcast story: the reason California police aren't enforcing the lockdown is because arresting lots of people and putting them in jail together leads to Covid cases spiking, defeating the purpose of the lockdown. This means that we are at the mercy of all the dumb assholes that dont care about Covid.
[0:11:01] <%captainpodock> he was taking about in game Pat not real life
[0:11:01] <%ArthurDayne88> I'll believe it when I see it
[0:11:01] <%isa_sensei96> Min-Max the hell out of that party.!
[0:11:05] <%MaddyCaddy> Wasteland 3 is great
[0:11:07] <%Lion_kun> PC or console?
[0:11:15] <%MaddyCaddy> Get both
[0:11:20] <%Daxalog> I found KissAss came up more so far.
[0:11:23] <%baka_sugoi> OwO Hello pat
[0:11:28] <tanarath> @monkeyweed21 They could fine them.
[0:11:39] <%jessyg920> I just watched the youtube video a day or two ago. I am super hype for this game
[0:11:39] <%Lion_kun> I bought console, was that a dumb?
[0:11:42] <%Daxalog> But the requirements for Kiss was like 3-5 usually.
[0:11:43] <%Nomad_Scholar> Nomad_Scholar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Sup.
[0:11:45] <%X2Eliah> Get kissass and badass for a total ass character
[0:11:47] <%MaddyCaddy> You need both because they both come up at different times
[0:11:56] <dereks0n> Just got here, probably my favorite game of this year that I've played so far, is this Pat's first time?
[0:12:00] <BoneBagMel> No. Console play game. Game good
[0:12:14] <shiibbae> Good morning bald dad PrideRise
[0:12:19] <+Jaromero435> its fine you can have like 6 party members
[0:12:20] <%ArthurDayne88> Series x version runs it pretty well
[0:12:26] <%MaddyCaddy> The first named NPC that joins your party starts with like 3 I believe, so you don't need it on your own rangers
[0:12:26] <Saltmeisterr> hello patrick
[0:12:32] <%Daxalog> You can get other characters to do the other stuff. And even make more later.
[0:12:33] <%X2Eliah> Isn't that good??
[0:12:36] <%owazowski> Get toaster repair
[0:12:36] <wanderingdain90> don't forget toaster repair

[0:12:41] <%FistTheWizard> dont worry by the time you have a full party everything tends to work out
[0:12:42] <Pyrowire> Morning Pat!
[0:12:44] <Saltmeisterr> good
[0:12:45] <%X2Eliah> Like, if you have an rpg where you get every skill... that's not much of an rpg
[0:12:46] <Monkeyweed21> @tanarath legislative bodies like city councils or the state government are in charge of what is a fineable offense, and they aren't making ignoring lockdown a fine cuz fuck you
[0:12:50] <+nabs2099> woah great timing. it's only 8pm for me. just got done w class
[0:12:52] <%theMrRoboto> Make a skill bitch with barter+modding+toaster repair and leave them in the base for inbetween missions
[0:12:55] <%nimu290> hi pat
[0:13:04] <%FistTheWizard> do not make the mistake I did and assume a jack of all trades build will work
[0:13:06] <+thedoritopug> Triple dipped on Divinity: OS 2. Wasteland was on my watchlist for games to get that were similar
[0:13:06] <Pyrowire> Never heard of these games, so what‚Äôs it like?
[0:13:08] <%FistTheWizard> it wont
[0:13:27] <%PinkertonDanPie> Im so Excited to watch u play Wasteland
[0:13:32] <+nabs2099> pat play Frostpunk if you like this game. you can execute the kids it's gr8!
[0:13:37] <%Daxalog> You can make a character later that just has all your bitch stuff.
[0:13:40] <dereks0n> By the end I just realized that some skills were a lost cause or that I didn't care about them
[0:13:40] <%skyentombment> @tizz86, thanks for the sub man!
[0:13:47] <%theMrRoboto> Toaster repair is only useful rarely unless you really want the fire resist
[0:13:52] <%PanicSwytch> Oh shit early stream
[0:13:58] <%skyentombment> @PatStaresAt is fire damage like chilli damage
[0:14:12] <%MaddyCaddy> By the end of the game, I had every skill on at least one party member, so you don't need to worry about it

[0:14:35] <%Joe2187> Was staring a frozen pic of pat for the last five minutes because I thought he was doing that thiing where he gets surprised and you cant tell if he died or the stream froze
[0:14:37] <+silentnight99999> hi dad
[0:14:41] <%PanicSwytch> This game needs a spreadsheet wtf
[0:14:53] <%sporeian94> Come on you can't deny the gameplay of 5 is possibly the best in the series
[0:15:01] <%logoth_> 5 is very... grueling
[0:15:09] <dereks0n> Bro there was a whale in the sky though
[0:15:09] <Monkeyweed21> 4 didn't cut kneecapped by Konami
[0:15:12] <%Daxalog> @PatStaresAt ALSO. You cannot remove weapon mods. Only overrite them with other mods. Keep that in mind. I almost lost a good mod to an old gun.
[0:15:15] <%FistTheWizard> it doesnt, the spreadsheet is just a patism
[0:15:19] <%big_papi_leo> RE5?
[0:15:19] <Wundervombatt> which game

[0:15:44] <Wundervombatt> ty
[0:15:47] <%honeyman18> I always feel like these games are supposed to be trial and error, make shit characters and find out what works.
[0:15:48] <%nimu290> odd

[0:16:08] <%SomeSageAdvice> legitimately i missed the part of what series Pat was talking about and it easily could have been Halo 4 and 5 he was talking about
[0:16:09] <$gfkxj> Brug then just say you didn't play one of the games. You can't really compare 2 games when you haven't played one
[0:16:14] <%BoxNavy> jeez
[0:16:15] <%X2Eliah> ... was mgs5 the one with the bikin clad lady skinbreather?
[0:16:16] <+silentnight99999> NotLikeThis
[0:16:19] <%Daxalog> If you spread yourself to thin on one chracter itll also hurt.
[0:16:24] <%SharkMissile> I super fucked up Jack of all trading my characters before realizing you get more customizable characters :(
[0:16:28] <%dekkitout> Built to die
[0:16:30] <%SharkMissile> I had to restart
[0:16:41] <%MaddyCaddy> They really needed the money
[0:16:49] <TheBlankAce> Steve O was looking really good lately too
[0:16:52] <%robo_trunk> @robo_trunk is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[0:16:54] <%nimu290> ?
[0:16:57] <%SharkMissile> Drugs!!
[0:16:58] <%dekkitout> Because 2020?
[0:16:59] <%sporeian94> I mean what the fuck has Dave England been up to lately
[0:17:01] <%hermitsen> "needed"
[0:17:02] <+Dova573> DRUGS?
[0:17:03] <%lastnamesilverlastname> They WANTED the money
[0:17:03] <Mr_Strut> Business doesn't run on need
[0:17:03] <%sporeian94> Those guys need money
[0:17:06] <%arcielardor> to pay for their hospital bills
[0:17:06] <%lastnamesilverlastname> They didn't NEED the money
[0:17:07] <+Dova573> MEDICAL BILLS
[0:17:07] <%X2Eliah> They needed the adrenaline
[0:17:07] <%nimu290> johnny was doing well
[0:17:09] <%captainpodock> Is Bam in it, he wants to die
[0:17:13] <Profmcstevie> Johnny Knoxville needing money? what a world
[0:17:17] <%mighty_max_t> Also, why do it during the pandemic?
[0:17:18] <%snow_bush> Execess drinking, poor money management, and an expensive lifestyle.
[0:17:22] <+nabs2099> Oh man this is unrelated but I'm having some creamy tomato soup rn and hot damn
[0:17:23] <%lastnamesilverlastname> They just WANTED it enough to put themselves at serious risk of real lasting physical harm
[0:17:27] <%DappercatEsquire> THEY DO IT FOR THE ART, PAT
[0:17:28] <Monkeyweed21> Bam Margera needs more crocodiles to put in his parents bed @PatStaresAt
[0:17:28] <%mike2hands> Bam margera is in
[0:17:34] <%laazybulbasaur> its tough turns
[0:17:36] <%lastnamesilverlastname> Because money is the route to like 99% of stupid shit people do
[0:17:41] <%laazybulbasaur> out
[0:17:41] <Mr_Strut> That seems like a bad idea
[0:17:41] <TourettesPlays> Get a fearless, suicidally depresed Bam to do all the dangerous stuff
[0:17:44] <heart_ablaze> I think they got sober after one of them died of an overdose or something
[0:17:52] <%robo_trunk> You need the booze to soften up the limbs
[0:17:53] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Monkeyweed21 Didn't Phil die though?
[0:18:02] <%AzureGale> Bam Margera had NO CONFIDENCE anymore

[0:18:22] <+Tucker0603> how far is pat in the game?
[0:18:30] <%Hessman212> In 3.5 you see Steve-O getting mad at the stunts he did in 3 while being sober
[0:18:41] <%BoxNavy> hehe

[0:18:52] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Fuck China

[0:18:57] <%sporeian94> The most imemrsive game ever
[0:18:59] <%blastazoid00> Is CDP linked to GoG?
[0:19:03] <%DappercatEsquire> those damn gamers, canceling games being put on platforms, which they totally did
[0:19:07] <%Agami23> no skatebird on gog. long live skatebird
[0:19:09] <%Piemono> Listen they're just living up to the example they show in the game
[0:19:12] <%X2Eliah> It's insane how bad Cyberpunk is, compared to the recent Deus Ex games
[0:19:13] <Monkeyweed21> @Gregorhasjoined by multiplayer do you mean MGO or FOBs? cuz FOBs were super fun but MGO sucked ass compared to 4
[0:19:14] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Games of Gondor?

[0:19:54] <TrollKing96> Is GOG the only way to LEGALLY get games DRM free?
[0:19:55] <$Moave> Hey Pat. I listened to the Podcast where you were talking about best direction. I went did some light digging. Another Award show that had the "Best Direction" award was MTV's Music Video Award. The VMA's best direction was given to artist, artist's manager, and the music video's director. So in short to the people heading the project. This means that TGA literally rewarded ND and Druckman himself for crunching his empoyees to dust.
[0:19:57] <+CarrowayFashonti> @patstaresat the devs on Ghostrunner were Polish

[0:21:15] <%Ne1son> @PatStaresAt do you have a bluetooth dongle for your PC or is it built in?
[0:21:19] <%X2Eliah> Pfffft Normcore?
[0:21:22] <%KeiganOfAstora> Ask and you shall receive
[0:21:23] <pjbuster> it was a man's butt first
[0:21:25] <%SharkMissile> Wasteland 3 is the Fallout 3 we deserved
[0:21:25] <%honeyman18> that's fine, shits hard
[0:21:28] <primarch_lupercal> how do u know pat
[0:21:32] <+Dova573> ok sarah connor narrator
[0:21:36] <+zsDirtyHarry> mangoWOO mangoWOO
[0:21:37] <+SpectrumSpy> wifi cards or mobo
[0:21:39] <%BoxNavy> get a fancier mobo
[0:21:41] <%OperatorJo_> I love how all the AAA game companies just keep playing this game of "How to destroy everything you've built in less than a decade"
[0:21:45] <%X2Eliah> Hahaha this silly game pretending that there is Snow in the future
[0:21:49] <mistspade> Oh hey it's that other ronald regan game of the year
[0:21:50] <%Infernal_Dalek> Infernal_Dalek subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Great, a cold looking game for my cold feelin' feet
[0:21:54] <%Flamefish345> Flamefish345 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Happy 9 months, Pat! Hope you, Paige and the babies are doing well during this forever plague. Have you thought of what you are going to play next after Yakuza is finished? Maybe you could play an old favorite of yours some time?
[0:21:55] <heart_ablaze> wtf is even happening
[0:21:56] <%Lion_kun> I love Fallout 2 so W3 hits all the right spots.
[0:22:00] <%MaddyCaddy> Kinda weird how the Desert Rangers are in New Vegas, but they're from Nevada instead.
[0:22:04] <%KeiganOfAstora> I thought bluetooth was a standard
[0:22:04] <+Jaromero435> BT dongles are fine
[0:22:04] <NeoseekerStitch> BB?
[0:22:09] <%toastybites> early strem today
[0:22:11] <+nabs2099> @patstaresat Are you ready to welcome chaos?
[0:22:12] <TourettesPlays> Damn my prebuilt from costco has bluetooth built in lol lmao
[0:22:22] <+Plus_On_Black> Why the fuck I can't send bits?
[0:22:28] <%shruke> This guy can just say he owns colorado
[0:22:40] <heart_ablaze> what is wasteland about?
[0:22:41] <+zsDirtyHarry> read the manual
[0:22:45] <%X2Eliah> Probably some bios switch
[0:22:49] <Gregorhasjoined> @Monkeyweed21 I mean multiplayer. The FOB system worked okay-ish but the actual multiplayer was a mishmash of old loadout options and perks that didn't quite work, maps recycled from ground zeroes and just generally unlikable skirmish modes.
[0:22:53] <%MaddyCaddy> Wasteland is about not dying
[0:22:55] <%X2Eliah> Just dig around and see whats there
[0:23:08] <%BoxNavy> it sure woulda been funny
[0:23:11] <heart_ablaze> @maddycaddy ah I see
[0:23:16] <+zsDirtyHarry> oh no
[0:23:17] <+koalaf1ed> Either that m,an is very strong or those cars are gone
[0:23:18] <%Willbo_Baggins> maybe go one at a time?
[0:23:19] <NeoseekerStitch> Ice road trucking. :P
[0:23:24] <%shruke> I hat when theres baby heads in my ice
[0:23:25] <%BoxNavy> D:
[0:23:28] <%X2Eliah> These guys did not wasteland good
[0:23:30] <%robo_trunk> *pokes ice* guess the can support a truck
[0:23:31] <%MaddyCaddy> The Desert Rangers do a bad job of not dying
[0:23:31] <moonmintparadise> Baby Evil and filled with mines
[0:23:35] <+zsDirtyHarry> The audio for that part is not good
[0:23:44] <%X2Eliah> Oh yeah
[0:23:46] <%cvp5127> shits cold
[0:23:47] <+Jaromero435> yeah, and it was worth it
[0:23:48] <%Agami23> maybe. depends on if they have hot water
[0:23:49] <%Daxalog> Youll get your answers soon enough
[0:23:51] <$Afterman_> would it tho? why not just drill into the ice, drop it in and let it refreeze
[0:23:52] <DidacticTactic> or they just dug holes and let them refreeze @PatStaresAt
[0:23:52] <%toastybites> listen man being in a cult automatically makes you good at planning shit
[0:23:54] <pjbuster> they could have just drilled a hole in the ice and waited
[0:23:56] <+koalaf1ed> lol @robo_trunk
[0:23:58] <+RogueEwok> Is this the start of the game?
[0:24:05] <%X2Eliah> Months of planning, for one-shot event
[0:24:11] <SGrim> Logic hard
[0:24:13] <%Willbo_Baggins> I prefer Pat's way
[0:24:15] <+Tucker0603> pro tip, you might want some points in the skill weird science...
[0:24:18] <+zsDirtyHarry> still why baby heads
[0:24:22] <+CannonHeroBrett> @RogueEwok no its the start of the game
[0:24:22] <+Anthropomorphized_Trash> Damn chat took the wind out of Pat's sails so fast LUL
[0:24:24] <%shruke> Where in the apocolypse do they source baby doll heads
[0:24:29] <+Jaromero435> Wasteland 2 is also great
[0:24:32] <viewtifulr> or wearing down the ice then adding more water ontop
[0:24:33] <%MaddyCaddy> Oh yeah, the Desert Rangers fucking hate robots
[0:24:34] <Mr_Strut> oh cool
[0:24:35] <stardustcrusad3r> is this the only time we see evil babyheads
[0:24:35] <+FirstFireKeeper> no just do it at summer
[0:24:36] <%MaddyCaddy> I forgot about that too
[0:24:38] <+balouie> wasteland came out before fallout
[0:24:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> Who makes this?
[0:24:39] <%BoxNavy> this games aesthetic is cool but these kinds of rpgs are murder for my brain

[0:36:34] <+CannonHeroBrett> @PatStaresAt what about medical marvel whats that do?
[0:36:35] <Monkeyweed21> make sure to get the asshole voices for you two

[0:39:01] <%BoxNavy> yep
[0:39:06] <%RealThiele> 70% is 0%
[0:39:19] <Sotetsu> Is Scrooge McDuck considered a negative Scottish stereotype?
[0:39:24] <otakon17> nah
[0:39:26] <+FirstFireKeeper> cute
[0:39:27] <%OperatorJo_> Gigapaige is all buffs
[0:39:32] <Sotetsu> Good
[0:39:33] <%MaddyCaddy> AP is the most important stat to increase
[0:39:39] <%BoxNavy> Clap
[0:39:40] <%X2Eliah> How can he be negative, Scrooge McDuck is rich
[0:39:41] <+cursedwithadhd> since we know she's actually short. does this mean this world suffered from the Tall-Pocalypse
[0:39:43] <otakon17> unlike XCOM, lower than 95% is actually NOT an automatic miss
[0:39:43] <%Dakuu75> hopefull you don't miss a 90% hit-rate like xcom
[0:39:45] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> chat has pat looked at empire of sin yet?
[0:39:56] <%RealThiele> PAUNCH
[0:39:59] <elcolossomascarado> is there a grenade on this like there is on Xcom?
[0:40:03] <otakon17> Speed is VERY important for melee characters
[0:40:08] <otakon17> there is
[0:40:10] <elcolossomascarado> because the grenade in Xcom is amazing
[0:40:11] <%BoxNavy> WutFace

[0:40:20] <%BoxNavy> is it the elmo hairs?
[0:40:20] <Essixian> @Dakuu75 Remember, a 90% chance to succeed is also a 10% chance to fail
[0:40:21] <Flare3500> someone's thinking about you Pat , probably woolie
[0:40:24] <%X2Eliah> Gesundheit
[0:40:24] <Sotetsu> @x2eliah I mean, rich people can still be bad. But Scrooge usually does what is right, so I hope he isn't.
[0:40:24] <JacktheSleeper42> God bless you
[0:40:28] <otakon17> gesundheit
[0:40:29] <%MaddyCaddy> There's an explosive skill and it's fucking great
[0:40:36] <%BoxNavy> elmos weird dust perhaps?
[0:40:41] <%MaddyCaddy> Spamming rockets and grenades is satisfying
[0:40:46] <%Dakuu75> @Essixian yes, thank you. lol
[0:40:48] <jacknerik> psaWhat_SA
[0:40:49] <Sotetsu> When Pat sneezed, I thought of "Bless me bagpipes!"
[0:40:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PAT HAS TO GET SCOTCHMO LATER
[0:40:55] <otakon17> You want HUNKER DOWN to defend on a turn you can't do anything
[0:40:57] <+FirstFireKeeper> cute
[0:40:59] <Essixian> Hunko
[0:41:04] <+Jaromero435> spiderbot go
[0:41:12] <%RealThiele> dats a wild wild west
[0:41:13] <MSN04_Sazabi> Did someone tell Pat about GOG cowarding out of putting Devotion on their store already?
[0:41:25] <otakon17> what's Devotion anyway?
[0:41:28] <otakon17> I keep hearing about it
[0:41:29] <%BoxNavy> scripted death jermaPluto
[0:41:31] <%X2Eliah> Oh, he knows
[0:41:36] <%Adojim> @MSN04_Sazabi he tweeted about it
[0:41:42] <otakon17> also the Railgun here is a good taste of power to come
[0:41:43] <digaogrunge> SHOOT THE HUMANS
[0:41:45] <Sotetsu> A really good atmospheric horror game.
[0:41:48] <%robo_trunk> "Okay guys, we're playing on normal" dies immediately
[0:41:49] <%MaddyCaddy> That's the armor
[0:41:51] <+Jaromero435> that was armor reduction
[0:41:59] <%toastybites> @otakon17 It's a game about the White Terror era in Taiwan
[0:42:02] <Flare3500> you can manual aim shot gun to cover more people
[0:42:09] <%X2Eliah> Wait, you had better hit %ages when you last played this
[0:42:13] <%robo_trunk> This is gonna be like Xcom all over again.
[0:42:18] <otakon17> @toastybites oh damn, that sounds contraversal
[0:42:24] <%PanicSwytch> Pat tweeted about devotion today
[0:42:31] <%MaddyCaddy> Paige's AP is too low for melee :(
[0:42:33] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @Sotetsu SO random guy on the internet here, in Don Rosa's stories scrooge becomes increasingly "evil", as in selfish, and is willing to cross increasingly serious moral boundaries for money. In his youth, however, he is shown as much more honourable and kind.
[0:42:35] <+Jaromero435> brute smarts
[0:42:41] <%augusta_wind> big! and! strong!
[0:42:52] <otakon17> @MaddyCaddy these characters aren't optimized
[0:43:00] <+Tucker0603> paige needs a bigger AP pool for melee
[0:43:09] <+Jaromero435> now they are all dead
[0:43:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat's goblin ass in here streaming so the pip pip cheerios can watch at not 3 AM
[0:43:11] <Coystick> How's it feel on controller compared to say Div 2 mate?
[0:43:12] <%the22cstomp> too short to be hit
[0:43:13] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[0:43:17] <otakon17> Melee needs STR, SPD
[0:43:17] <Flare3500> In my playtrough they killed one of my characters first
[0:43:18] <MSN04_Sazabi> @toastybites That's Detention by the same dev. Devotion is more of a family horror story. Ironically mainland China loved Detention because it told about KMT doing the no-no things, but a single picture making fun of Xi Jinping inh Devotion got it pulled from Steam
[0:43:23] <Essixian> BIG GUN
[0:43:33] <%RealThiele> just in time for the red shirts to die
[0:43:40] <%BoxNavy> kill :)
[0:43:53] <viewtifulr> shes eating the corpse? cant say surprised
[0:44:06] <Flare3500> if their name doesn't show up with percent it means they're not getting hit
[0:44:08] <otakon17> I wonder if the bug where only your first character gets ammunition is still present
[0:44:21] <otakon17> You got TWO shots before you have to reload
[0:44:26] <%toastybites> @MSN04_Sazabi woaps my bad. I thought both games were banned because of government shills
[0:44:33] <%SharkMissile> Go gobbolin
[0:44:34] <+Tucker0603> shotguns, need you to position the max number of people in your sight for max carnage
[0:44:37] <%SharkMissile> crikHype crikHype
[0:44:49] <otakon17> yeah, shotguns are very strange in this
[0:45:06] <otakon17> Now, loot the bodies!
[0:45:11] <Sotetsu> Pat and Paige are my one of the most killers in DbD. sipsipDab
[0:45:17] <%AzureGale> Perfect!
[0:45:19] <Sotetsu> *most fun

[0:45:41] <%X2Eliah> Pat you are 100% attitude
[0:45:45] <DianaTheAscian> I wonder if its possible for those guys to make it
[0:45:46] <%BoxNavy> goblin.....
[0:45:47] <Sotetsu> Ugh, Arizona is the worst.
[0:45:48] <%toastybites> "Come with me if you don't want to live"
[0:45:59] <+Tucker0603> Pat IS the Attitude era
[0:46:02] <%X2Eliah> If you showed up at WWE, Pat, they'd say it's the Attitude Era all over again

[0:57:30] <%StaceMcGate> @MrPedrovsky Easiest is Elf and SMN/Hydrophist. Summoning will give you an extra character in combat. As for pro-tip, pick the 3 companions you like the best and stick with those. Don't bother with the others
[0:57:31] <%OperatorJo_> robit down
[0:57:32] <DSD24> @MrPedrovsky Anything as long as you don't go Undead for the first time, they have special mechanics thats hard for a first playthough

[0:59:25] <JacktheSleeper42> Paige big and strong
[0:59:28] <Flare3500> Paige will actually carry if Pat builds right
[0:59:30] <@commanderclaw> At least there's no carry weight, and infinite inventory space
[0:59:35] <+thedoritopug> If you want to do max AP, then do Elf, Scoundrel, and someone with Haste
[0:59:40] <Visorak6> crate behind you

[1:00:08] <%arcielardor> cyberpunk
[1:00:11] <%thetrashman_sc> this game is real frikkin good
[1:00:16] <%X2Eliah> It's no cyberpunk though
[1:00:18] <%MaddyCaddy> Wasteland 2 was okay, but this is a massive improvement
[1:00:23] <%OperatorJo_> Goblin the Blind
[1:00:27] <@commanderclaw> Oh yeah, wasteland 3 is jank AF
[1:00:33] <%X2Eliah> Hey, is there a "Highlight Items" button?
[1:00:34] <%RealThiele> cock of the bloc
[1:00:35] <DianaTheAscian> PogChamp
[1:00:37] <moonmintparadise> It is hard to go back to other games like it once you have played Wastelands 3
[1:00:37] <$MrPedrovsky> Is necromancy viable in divinity 2? And can i get a skeleton army like in Diablo 2??
[1:00:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> not anymore
[1:00:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @X2Eliah yup
[1:01:09] <Flare3500> I played wasteland 3 for an hour went back to wasteland 2 , then finished 3
[1:01:11] <%MaddyCaddy> Will Pat die again?
[1:01:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> CHAT I ASK YOU AGAIN: ARE YOU WASHED IN THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB?
[1:01:19] <%OctaivianRex> You can have a big skeleton spider in Divinity if you want.
[1:01:22] <%OperatorJo_> Pat can Crit like the best of em'
[1:01:23] <Blank9> it's a relaxed fast game
[1:01:32] <%thetrashman_sc> YEEHAW
[1:01:33] <+thedoritopug> @MrPedrovsky Necromancy does big Physical Damage if you have High Intelligence, just use it if you don't mind being a "mage" in close combat
[1:01:35] <Coystick> Hotlander that's a good one
[1:01:38] <Visorak6> Yeah that p good
[1:01:40] <%MaddyCaddy> Talking heads are great
[1:01:46] <%dashmatt> CHRISTOPHER WALKEN...?
[1:01:47] <$MrPedrovsky> @patstaresat Look up button for item highlights in controls
[1:01:49] <DianaTheAscian> looks goood
[1:01:50] <%MaddyCaddy> Reminds me of Fallout 1 and 2
[1:01:52] <HorribleHog> that's just how southern people talk i think
[1:01:53] <%MoguManda> all the close-ups of characters are perfect
[1:02:02] <NeoseekerStitch> Looks like Joker
[1:02:03] <+thedoritopug> But you don't get so summon Skeleton warriors like D2. The actual Summoning Skill Tree is pretty useful
[1:02:08] <ergulor> i didn't noticed his entrails scarf
[1:02:23] <ChungusQuest> @MrPedrovsky no mega armies, but Necro does all physical damage, so it's perfect for hybrid melee
[1:02:23] <%Dakuu75> what is this Mad Max shit? lol
[1:02:26] <%BoxNavy> D:
[1:02:27] <%ConLin_Arts_> PogChamp

[1:03:49] <+Tucker0603> SOUNDTRACK IS THE BEST
[1:04:01] <%Bailey__gaming> can someone some up this game for someone who doesnt know what a Wasteland is?
[1:04:02] <%jorniev> THIS as an intro of a game specially a turn based one, should be done more.
[1:04:13] <Flare3500> This is their ORIGINAL Soundtrack , will they DMCA that too ?

[1:34:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> U GET ONE FREE PASS
[1:34:42] <%MaddyCaddy> The fucking Gippers
[1:34:43] <Flare3500> This setup is 100 times better than Wasteland 2 where "Hey install these repeaters until end game"
[1:34:43] <+vanareus> pretty sure scorpions can't be tamed. they're not gonna learn tricks or defend you. but some are docile enough to use as pets
[1:34:44] <%Bailey__gaming> Ooh Aspen Let's go Skiing
[1:34:45] <BurdRightsActivist> Simp
[1:34:49] <KynnRedgrave> i'm pretty sure you can also just say fuck him and betray him and completely take over
[1:34:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> He wants you to bring them home alive so HE can kill them.
[1:34:52] <%honeyman18> what a prick
[1:35:03] <mattymcfilth> WHERES MY MONEY THO
[1:35:09] <Sotetsu> Ask him if Liberty is hot.
[1:35:20] <%MaddyCaddy> Liberty is pretty hot

[1:35:38] <%viciousgrim> kid just jumps off. . . nagiFail
[1:35:39] <Broken_Sonex> Library IS actually really hot
[1:35:44] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @Sotetsu but paige is literally right next to him
[1:36:08] <%toastybites> thats not a bad speech
[1:36:08] <jbournehd> Make Paige ask if Liberty is hot
[1:36:28] <DSD24> Never name your kid Victory
[1:36:33] <Broken_Sonex> THEY DID A DOGSHIT JOB
[1:36:33] <Flare3500> Send people Colorado because Arizona is pretty fucked up
[1:36:34] <%MaddyCaddy> Yeah, General Vargas can survive. but in this, he's gone, so it seems it didn't turn out too well.

[1:37:48] <jbournehd> This man is bad at parenting
[1:37:50] <Thetruestblacksun> Therapy is not gonna work on sociopaths, especially of Vic‚Äôs caliber
[1:37:51] <%DappercatEsquire> is this guy a bad dad?
[1:37:55] <%bevyrage> bad father has bad children
[1:37:59] <%X2Eliah> Well, he has to die too

[1:38:14] <HorribleHog> What did he think would happen?!
[1:38:14] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> This guy sucks. His family sucks but they probably got it from him.
[1:38:17] <DianaTheAscian> u sound like a dumbass Patriarch
[1:38:22] <redrins> put your shitty son in a position of power, whatever could go wrong
[1:38:25] <Broken_Sonex> Bad Dad but also bad kids

[1:42:10] <+JonJonRequiem> BIG LEVEL UP SEX POWER
[1:42:12] <%MaddyCaddy> If you started with 10 Charisma you'd be like level 5 at this point
[1:42:16] <dukenux> Paige can hit things really hard, but only once
[1:42:22] <otakon17> you can recruit the deer
[1:42:22] <$MrPedrovsky> Yakuzza worst patriarch
[1:42:27] <Flare3500> There are doggos at the back of the building STAT BOOST
[1:42:33] <+BallerSwagBro9k> @X2Eliah Every plan hes had has caused a lot of people to die and fail leaving Kiryu to clean up the mess
[1:42:37] <DianaTheAscian> baby?
[1:42:37] <%thetrashman_sc> daigo has the unfortunate position of being the MK Raiden of his series
[1:42:38] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> I hear a baby PogChamp
[1:42:40] <Blank9> daigo's dad is terrible and daigo himself got to be a leader from pure nepotism, and proceeded to fuck things up since 2006
[1:42:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> A female deer
[1:42:44] <dukenux> those are cute perk sketches
[1:42:48] <%thetrashman_sc> if he does his job well there cant be a story
[1:42:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> Bruh Paige is literally Bigger Boot right now
[1:42:51] <%NovaKnightmare> You look like an asshole big daddy cosplayer
[1:42:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> Elmo?

[1:43:07] <otakon17> anyway have fun
[1:43:08] <rizintaco> In the game?
[1:43:09] <Flare3500> Max out Coordination
[1:43:10] <%MaddyCaddy> AP is very important
[1:43:11] <huskarl_zap> max strength
[1:43:12] <Blank9> Maybe speed for her AP?
[1:43:13] <CursedNobleman> BIG DADDY
[1:43:14] <@commanderclaw> It's a good stat, AP is always good
[1:43:15] <UlriktheSlayer1> well if its paige...
[1:43:15] <+chicken_danger> it's one the best stats
[1:43:16] <dukenux> Yes... oh you mean, in game? Yes
[1:43:16] <%honeyman18> Is she just Doctor Bong now?
[1:43:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Wait till Paige gets the full set
[1:43:17] <CursedNobleman> or mommy i guess
[1:43:17] <TrollKing96> Paige looking like Subject Delta.
[1:43:18] <%SABiscotti> AP is always good
[1:43:19] <Visorak6> action economy is almost always the most important thing in any turn based game @PatStaresAt
[1:43:19] <+Jaromero435> more AP = good
[1:43:20] <%OperatorJo_> in real life or
[1:43:20] <%MaddyCaddy> It's the most important stat in this game
[1:43:20] <kingdinkyI> Yes
[1:43:31] <%MaddyCaddy> If you can't do your actions in combat, your other stats don't matter
[1:43:32] <Broken_Sonex> She needs it BAD
[1:43:32] <%Daxalog> Coordination is a great stat
[1:43:32] <Flare3500> you'll be overleveled don't worry
[1:43:36] <Blank9> oh coordination is AP, weird
[1:43:39] <dukenux> Yeah, she does look like she escaped from Bioshock 2
[1:43:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> In re@lmlife or in game
[1:43:48] <CursedNobleman> It's like bioshock in reverse LUL
[1:44:01] <%Daxalog> You only get another AP every 2 or so pips on it
[1:44:03] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> I assume Paige is gonna be the heavy weapons user?
[1:44:04] <HorribleHog> And remember -- respect. is. everything!
[1:44:05] <kingdinkyI> Give yourself a sidearm
[1:44:07] <sonicblade38> that looks like moltar from space ghost
[1:44:08] <DSD24> Kiss Ass
[1:44:09] <%strakillias> I just got here, WHY is Paige a big daddy?
[1:44:25] <CursedNobleman> because pat is a lil' brother LUL
[1:44:27] <Flare3500> Go pure glass cannon fuck balanced builds
[1:44:29] <%Daxalog> Id say first aid
[1:44:30] <%X2Eliah> When has paige not been a big daddy?
[1:44:31] <Monkeyweed21> lockpicking
[1:44:31] <Visorak6> what upgrades shotguns?
[1:44:36] <CursedNobleman> pat needs to get the eve LUL
[1:44:37] <SGrim> Always heal
[1:44:53] <Flare3500> Elmo is gonna be the lockthief master
[1:44:56] <%Daxalog> Some healing items cant be used unless you have the first aid minimum
[1:44:59] <Visorak6> oh it means literal small arms as in non anti-tank weapons got it
[1:45:12] <SaltyAzteca> Cat burglar Kappa
[1:45:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> The smollest of arms
[1:45:23] <%MaddyCaddy> Your stat spread is already pretty huge on Goblin, so you probably shouldn't get new skills on him and focus on what you have
[1:45:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WE KNOW YOUR MIIIIIIIIIIIIND
[1:45:34] <%OperatorJo_> yeh
[1:45:38] <dukenux> Point in gun is never wasted
[1:45:39] <Blank9> maybe first aid
[1:45:41] <ergulor> Since when are shotguns "Small arms"?
[1:45:42] <+pectusumbra> I don't know
[1:45:43] <+JonJonRequiem> ye
[1:45:44] <%X2Eliah> Should be "small legs" if we wanna be accurate
[1:45:44] <%king_wragles> do whatever
[1:45:45] <HorribleHog> all speech every day
[1:45:45] <Torgue_1> Sure, why not
[1:45:50] <Visorak6> nothing wrong with making your guns kill more gooder
[1:45:53] <%MaddyCaddy> I like the contextual skills
[1:45:54] <%Daxalog> Will gief be your barter dog?
[1:45:56] <+OhioNitsud> Combat skills?
[1:45:57] <Flare3500> if you can't talk to them shoot them
[1:45:58] <jbournehd> put everything in charisma
[1:45:59] <+HeroSolaire> C'est la vie the cat burglar!
[1:46:00] <+chicken_danger> small arms for small arms
[1:46:00] <$MrPedrovsky> @patstaresat First aid to 4
[1:46:01] <kingdinkyI> Yeah don‚Äôt spread out so much
[1:46:04] <Zebroneath> Will Zangief be the rescue pup?
[1:46:05] <%AzureGale> BECOME BIG DADDY
[1:46:05] <%MaddyCaddy> I only level gun when I need to use a new weapon
[1:46:05] <%SirGO0SE> smol arms for smol pat :)
[1:46:08] <boywunderkind> Small Arms gets you the best perk in the game
[1:46:09] <HorribleHog> i can't get over that helmet
[1:46:09] <viewtifulr> but how will small arms carry? why with HUGA HANDS
[1:46:11] <burgersteel> She needs an anchor
[1:46:14] <Bonte__> She looks like a Big Daddy lmao
[1:46:14] <Flare3500> Lul why is there weird science
[1:46:15] <waywardhavoc> you should have a dedicated medic, they get really powerful
[1:46:17] <%owazowski> Small arms for small man
[1:46:21] <%MaddyCaddy> This game has skills books btw
[1:46:22] <+Tucker0603> weird science might be good soon too
[1:46:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> Man 8
[1:46:24] <dukenux> The Hardest Ass in the west
[1:46:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> I,m
[1:46:28] <%Omegaanimus> don't spread out at all in this game, it rewards you big for totally specialized characters
[1:46:28] <Blank9> diamond ass
[1:46:29] <DSD24> You want other characters to cover skill deficiencies
[1:46:29] <%Bailey__gaming> the firmest of buts
[1:46:30] <+wicketpelican> any arm is small if your dick is huge
[1:46:37] <Flare3500> just keep that weird science at one point for Paige
[1:46:45] <%Bailey__gaming> Ass is Unbreakable
[1:46:48] <waywardhavoc> leadership can also be cool to buff ap before your other units begin their turn
[1:46:51] <HorribleHog> KOTOR style
[1:46:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> Man I‚Äôm at work right now, make your own choices
[1:46:57] <UlriktheSlayer1> ive seen some ads for this game and it seems cool, has it been good so far?
[1:47:06] <dukenux> How many crewmates you can have?
[1:47:15] <%Omegaanimus> You'll see how you balance characters out soon, it gets a little crazy
[1:47:19] <%jorniev> get a heavy weapins guy
[1:47:22] <%MaddyCaddy> 7 iirc
[1:47:26] <+chicken_danger> youll love the machine collective later
[1:47:32] <mattymcfilth> i like that the skill is called "nerd stuff"
[1:47:32] <DSD24> You can 4 created
[1:47:36] <boywunderkind> Might be six
[1:47:38] <%Omegaanimus> this game may be too easy to become OP
[1:47:39] <%mighty_max_t> These robits sound kinda like the Faith dialogue sound effects

[1:48:02] <DSD24> @Jaysky Yes it is

[1:50:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> @broken_sonex there‚Äôs an upgrade coming
[1:50:13] <+Jaysky> Nothing wrong with a bit of a bro jerk
[1:50:14] <mattymcfilth> Greatski... Mr Hockey?
[1:50:18] <%DakotaMacDoodle> The director's cut of Disco does say full voice-acting for everyone.
[1:50:19] <%derap41> Odorseys!
[1:50:20] <dukenux> there should be "are you done with circlejerk?" option
[1:50:20] <%jorniev> HE Fuking keeps count
[1:50:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> just kith
[1:50:34] <%crimsonharvest> just read about cdp not selling Devotion after all and my face hit my hands so hard
[1:51:01] <Flare3500> "Join my team to secretly over take the Patriarch"
[1:51:26] <Visorak6> I mean after his kids betrayed him it makes sense to keep your allies surveilled
[1:51:29] <dukenux> AS is Elmo
[1:51:30] <+Tucker0603> hat and scarf
[1:51:32] <%DappercatEsquire> maybe it's a maine coon
[1:51:32] <%MaddyCaddy> Because the smokes make him stronker
[1:51:33] <%SharkMissile> @PatStaresAt I *have* heard you enjoy a little hat
[1:51:36] <%thetrashman_sc> he needs a hat
[1:51:38] <%derap41> You better protect that sweet puss with your life
[1:51:40] <Flare3500> By the By Pat if the Cat dies , it's gone forever

[1:51:58] <%Omegaanimus> PATRIARCH OF COLORADO boomf boomf
[1:52:10] <dukenux> i like how they called it The Deluge
[1:52:13] <%aishman> aishman subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! Man how sad is it that CP2077 runs WORSE than BG3, a game that's still not actually complete and in Early Access? Speaking of are you gonna come back to once it's done?
[1:52:21] <huskarl_zap> WOOLIE HAS ENTERED THE CHAT
[1:52:23] <%DappercatEsquire> why don't you just call the things what they are though
[1:52:23] <%derap41> Deluge does sound cool
[1:52:38] <DianaTheAscian> WOOLIE BEGONE
[1:52:46] <+Jaromero435> I love you Kodiak
[1:52:54] <Flare3500> Paige, party swap with the car
[1:53:03] <%Omegaanimus> Deluge implies a sudden and massive flood
[1:53:11] <%Daxalog> ONLY in outgoing missions
[1:53:11] <%Omegaanimus> a flood can just be a flood
[1:53:12] <waywardhavoc> if you have a dedicated mechanic you can deploy walls of turrets and robots
[1:53:18] <+Greywyn00> Is that a custom Icon?
[1:53:18] <+Tucker0603> YEYEYEYEYEYE

[1:54:32] <+pectusumbra> It should be long enough for him to eat some of it
[1:54:34] <Flare3500> Just wear a ninja mask , to cover the whole head
[1:54:42] <viewtifulr> PPEEEP on camera
[1:54:43] <+Tucker0603> make him look like he's from KISS
[1:54:47] <%AzureGale> They are people pets
[1:54:47] <ergulor> that one
[1:54:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> Like Kenny
[1:54:51] <+Greywyn00> fluffy
[1:54:56] <%derap41> That's pretty obscuring
[1:54:57] <clempstwitch> So what're ya makin?
[1:54:57] <huskarl_zap> Khajit has wares if you have the coin.
[1:54:58] <$MrPedrovsky> F E E T _ G A N G. @clempstwitch
[1:54:59] <DianaTheAscian> yeah
[1:54:59] <%LadyRarityV> That one for sure
[1:55:07] <viewtifulr> dont we hate raiders
[1:55:09] <%Omegaanimus> so Lucha Elmo and Lucha Zangief
[1:55:09] <Flare3500> You get armor that look like ninja shit later on
[1:55:10] <Blank9> they're actually three cats/dogs stacked on each other wearing a coat
[1:55:10] <+Greywyn00> what about color 2?
[1:55:13] <Visorak6> so all I'm getting from this so far is this game is basically xcom + fallout
[1:55:13] <%derap41> Mega tiny peepee
[1:55:14] <%JeanGardner99> WHAt
[1:55:15] <%superdeliverer> BIG GIANT WHITE FLOOF ARMOUR
[1:55:22] <DSD24> Snipe
[1:55:23] <%baka_sugoi> PogChamp LUL
[1:55:24] <Torgue_1> Not white/black?
[1:55:29] <+gitgouda> GREMLIN
[1:55:34] <DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL
[1:55:37] <derap41> So this is a Ratling
[1:55:40] <GarbageQueenEllie> You could have a whole squad of gnomes
[1:55:44] <%NovaKnightmare> If this was accurate, Elmo would have bad coordination but amazing luck
[1:55:48] <Flare3500> If he's a lockpick dude , int would be perfect
[1:55:49] <ShinChris> i paused in menus, then i unpaused into menus
[1:55:52] <%mighty_max_t> Elmo the genius
[1:55:52] <clempstwitch> OH you're making pee pee, got it
[1:55:54] <%LadyRarityV> roflgatorKek roflgatorKek roflgatorKek
[1:55:59] <dukenux> You'll need to make Zangief fucking wide and hueg to balance this out
[1:56:04] <%snow_bush> All luck, all charisma, 0 in everything else.
[1:56:08] <DSD24> He doesn't need Small arms
[1:56:21] <+Greywyn00> why is toaster repair a skill LUL
[1:56:23] <DSD24> Oh ok then
[1:56:29] <%MaddyCaddy> Snipers use all their AP for one shot
[1:56:31] <ShinChris> is coordination dex basically?
[1:56:36] <%JeanGardner99> all in toaster repair
[1:56:37] <+Tucker0603> TOASTER REPAIR IS THE BEST
[1:56:39] <%MaddyCaddy> Pistols aren't very good
[1:56:42] <Flare3500> well don't make the enemy reach elmo
[1:56:43] <+Tucker0603> YOU GET CRAZY SHIT
[1:56:48] <%MaddyCaddy> For snipers at least
[1:56:58] <clempstwitch> the ambience is creepy
[1:57:05] <%rdark_ksu> !uptime
[1:57:05] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 57m.
[1:57:12] <%derap41> Its just 1 skill point
[1:57:12] <rizintaco> Can't you get another guy?
[1:57:13] <+Tucker0603> I repaired a toaster AND GOT AN ENERGY LMG
[1:57:15] <rizintaco> Peepee 2
[1:57:16] <+Greywyn00> how can toasters possibly be good enough to warrant a whole skill LUL
[1:57:16] <Flare3500> You can tenchinically create a character again later
[1:57:18] <Flare3500> no respec
[1:57:20] <+abrupt_abe> You can always remake later
[1:57:21] <dukenux> the ambient music reminds me of Stalker
[1:57:23] <+Greywyn00> OH
[1:57:32] <dukenux> which is fitting i guess
[1:57:41] <%derap41> You can just create a new character if they turn into trash
[1:57:48] <@commanderclaw> 7
[1:57:49] <UlriktheSlayer1> i like these robot mascots they use for the skills
[1:57:49] <%MaddyCaddy> Like 5 or 6
[1:57:50] <+Jaromero435> 6 i think]
[1:57:50] <%derap41> 7-8
[1:57:53] <@commanderclaw> New patch increased it
[1:57:53] <Broken_Sonex> Time to totally not whip out that guide
[1:57:55] <%CzeekyPlays> "Can always remake later" "No respec" good job chat
[1:57:56] <+edited156> A lot
[1:57:57] <+Jaromero435> some might be 5
[1:57:58] <tanarath> a lot
[1:57:59] <+Tucker0603> repairing toasters gives you the ability to get CRAZY SHIT
[1:58:02] <Flare3500> depends on the weapons 6 usually I think
[1:58:02] <%MaddyCaddy> Jeez
[1:58:04] <Zbyrd0961> 7 after the last patch right?
[1:58:04] <$MrPedrovsky> 7
[1:58:10] <boywunderkind> Like 6 or 7
[1:58:14] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> 6-8
[1:58:25] <+Jaromero435> it was mostly 6 at launch with some of them varying
[1:58:25] <%owazowski> 6 minimum
[1:58:46] <+Tucker0603> i recommend giving someone toaster repair cause you can get crazy items from fixing them
[1:58:46] <Flare3500> what's the role play ?
[1:58:46] <kingdinkyI> A lot is there much point in giving anyone but the leader charisma
[1:58:54] <Monkeyweed21> pistols suck ass
[1:58:55] <%derap41> so Xcom Sniper
[1:58:55] <tanarath> just do sniper then do pistol later if viable
[1:59:00] <+Jaromero435> Ambush is based on weapon AP i believe
[1:59:03] <CursedNobleman> is it optimal to have a big party? or is this like icewind dale where small means your power is concetrated
[1:59:10] <$MrPedrovsky> Rifle/ambush best @patstaresat
[1:59:16] <%MaddyCaddy> I wouldn't. but you do you
[1:59:18] <Flare3500> that seems really bad , just have a sniper dude . there's a good gunslinger NPC later on if you really want to min max
[1:59:23] <%crimsonharvest> in actually OG xcom, a sniper round costs 75% of your AP
[1:59:25] <$MrPedrovsky> Pistols underwhelming @patstaresat
[1:59:41] <+Tucker0603> I made a dedicated mechanic dwarf
[1:59:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> Meeeerrwwww!
[1:59:57] <%derap41> Glass cannon sniper it is
[1:59:58] <+Tucker0603> she kicks ass with her shotgun

[2:44:17] <+TheEvilOmega> He seems trustworthy, though.
[2:44:19] <dukenux> I feel bad for the guy... but i also feel he's not telling you everything
[2:44:20] <+loukemia83> This guy seems legit to me
[2:44:20] <butthurtdave> Do you want an answer or no?
[2:44:21] <+Greywyn00> no one wants to get involved
[2:44:28] <%Noogiez> yo
[2:44:29] <%derap41> First thing you do is suggest a guy should starve to death in a cell
[2:44:30] <dinnydanny777> It would probably be more humane to just kill him than leave him
[2:44:32] <%Pappajimbo> he seems sketch. lets let him out
[2:44:32] <%PinkertonDanPie> mmmmm let him live
[2:44:40] <%bevyrage> time to save imo
[2:44:42] <+TheEvilOmega> He's answered your questions and seems pretty nice despite being high on shrooms. Actually, that's probably what makes him so chill.

[2:45:18] <+TheEvilOmega> Why does Pat's character look like Zubaz?
[2:45:19] <+Tucker0603> check body with first aid

[2:45:45] <butthurtdave> Also Pat, you can make infinite backup characters by talking to one of the dudes in the main hall. It's good to use that to make a skill monkey for weapon/armor mods and other stuff

[2:55:35] <+Inverse_Girth> Make sure to toggle off of the group when disabling traps so it‚Äôs just one character moving bc the group will mess up and trigger it
[2:56:17] <%MoguManda> yeaa toaster slut

[2:56:42] <Flare3500> You're gonna have to squeeze the specialization on all 4 of your characters
[2:56:53] <butthurtdave> The robot check will lead to a fight, just a heads up

[2:58:13] <%Lone_Xeno> they got her too???
[2:58:16] <+chaumiester> @ItalianWaifu So unfair at certain points, and requires constant saves?
[2:58:17] <butthurtdave> Tarjan Tokens are a usual reward from Toasters, they can give random permanent/semi-permanent buffs at a vendor later on
[2:58:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> the barrack gotta get te barrack
[2:58:28] <+Inverse_Girth> Save Tarjans. You‚Äôll know when you need them

[2:59:40] <%derap41> Yeah levels are global
[2:59:41] <@commanderclaw> I think everyone gets XP, don't quote me though
[2:59:42] <%derap41> kinda
[2:59:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> they do
[3:00:10] <butthurtdave> If not, your new created rangers will jump to your current character levels iirc
[3:00:16] <+dannyboy245> where did you get that shirt?
[3:00:20] <+chicken_danger> agent dana skelly
[3:00:30] <Broken_Sonex> Well that's fucking stupid if they don't share XP
[3:00:45] <+chaumiester> "I think everyone gets XP, don't quote me though" ~ commanderclaw
[3:00:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ALL CHARACTERS GET XP
[3:00:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ONE GUY WAS WRONG
[3:01:07] <Flare3500> "They don't really gain XP, they're just boosted to the party's average level when put in the group."
[3:01:18] <Flare3500> because I remember my MC being higher level than everyone

[3:03:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THANOS SNAPPED LUL
[3:03:43] <Visorak6> I think he vanished because you cant have more than 4
[3:03:45] <+chaumiester> Did he get..... Plague by GRIPES!!
[3:03:47] <+Tucker0603> ITS BUGGING A BIT
[3:03:48] <%Daxalog> Like for instance I didnt see that prison character
[3:03:49] <%LadyRarityV> Plague got the Plague monkaS

[3:04:10] <%shruke> Where were you when Plague was kill?
[3:04:10] <@SSaryn> You can only have 4 Rangers specifically.
[3:04:16] <%Ipsenscastle> Michelle Kwan?
[3:04:23] <@SSaryn> Otherwise it doesn't show the other rangers.
[3:04:41] <%notgarza> He got bored and left
[3:04:43] <+TheEvilOmega> Beware the wrath of Kwon!
[3:04:45] <%shruke> How does Elmo actually look like a Palico
[3:04:50] <%derap41> if you have a medic they can use kuts to heal others
[3:04:54] <@SSaryn> Once you have 4 Rangers, you can only fill your fifth and sixth slots with NPCs.
[3:05:27] <%radda343> you forgot the room near the cfe
[3:05:29] <%derap41> Jodie is nice

[3:13:32] <%radda343> I love it when crpg characters set off traps when you tell them to disarm them
[3:13:33] <+Tucker0603> @Tucker0603 YEP
[3:13:36] <%radda343> it's my favorite
[3:13:37] <huskarl_zap> SSSsss
[3:13:37] <%crimsonharvest> donmai
[3:13:44] <@SSaryn> So if it wasn't already apparent, maybe have your Explosives person lead.
[3:13:49] <HorribleHog> man, traps are so inconsequential in these games
[3:14:03] <@SSaryn> They're not in long term, trust me.
[3:14:06] <butthurtdave> You can toggle fashion btw
[3:14:11] <%MoguManda> qwan can equip the pulse gun if you want
[3:14:13] <+Inverse_Girth> Make sure you move solo when disabling traps
[3:14:13] <Flare3500> when going through tight spaces try to have not group selected
[3:14:26] <+bugz_munny> tell that to my PotD Pillars playthrough
[3:14:26] <viewtifulr> would you call it Big Mommy?
[3:14:28] <%MaddyCaddy> You need to hire a doctor first
[3:14:30] <%derap41> You don't have that yet
[3:14:30] <@SSaryn> Only if you got a Doctor.
[3:14:30] <tux_3do> this game is tOUGH
[3:14:32] <%MoguManda> opposite the mechaic area
[3:14:35] <@SSaryn> Which you don't.
[3:14:36] <Flare3500> Healing room but no doctor sadge
[3:14:44] <tux_3do> if you leave for the springs you'll find one
[3:14:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NO DOCTOR
[3:14:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Just go in town
[3:14:57] <%radda343> peepee did his best
[3:14:58] <Flare3500> Don't worry you've got ccash for some first aid in the next town

[3:15:08] <blackbaron98> this game isnt shy about fucking you up lol
[3:15:09] <+Pyroclase> That happens randomly once the blood moon starts and your insight is high enough.
[3:15:10] <%derap41> No idea think you're cray
[3:15:14] <theanora1> did Geif Kidnap a baby?
[3:15:18] <%Puhff> my bad, that's me

[3:16:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[3:16:18] <YamadaZero> It did look kind of dangerous.
[3:16:23] <Warstar696> It's pretty shitty that W3 doesn't recognize certain actions, like ATTEMPTING to disarm obvious fucking tracks and then that NPC is somehow (through game logic) forced to open the container without even trying to disarm.
[3:16:24] <+bugz_munny> What a shame
[3:16:27] <Jonny_Uppercut> What a shame ayaFOCUS
[3:16:28] <%shurtal> I"ve been to dowtown Colorado Springs! ...not much has changed

[3:28:53] <dinnydanny777> Is that the woman from RE7 LUL
[3:29:06] <Zebroneath> that's pretty fucking raw
[3:29:06] <dinnydanny777> That doesn't look good
[3:29:11] <Broken_Sonex> They've seen Game of Thrones
[3:29:16] <+koalaf1ed> Sounding more 'merican by the second
[3:29:37] <+MisterAvry> I hope the twist on this quest is that she's full of it
[3:29:45] <%crimsonharvest> fuckin Watkins
[3:29:50] <%crimsonharvest> no watkins was ever a good person
[3:29:52] <ValentineWolf7> public furry execution?
[3:29:54] <%Lone_Xeno> @Zebroneath You say as dead bodies litter the floor everywhere soaking in puddles of their own blood
[3:30:31] <%LadyRarityV> TAPE??
[3:30:53] <%Lone_Xeno> Tape? He probably smells the horse that was melted down into tape glue
[3:31:01] <+MisterAvry> Is food? On floor, must be food. eat? food get?
[3:31:15] <%crimsonharvest> checks out, every pease I know is skinny. is this game made by people who live near me?
[3:31:34] <%MaddyCaddy> PEEZ
[3:31:56] <%crimsonharvest> seriously i've never seen these family names anywhere but where i live its bizarre
[3:32:06] <%shurtal> Yup, this certainly looks like present day Downtown Colorado Springs
[3:32:16] <$Afterman_> is that a motherucking voice actor from 13 sentienls??
[3:32:23] <%AzureGale> Ah yes, Rosebud Frozen Pease
[3:32:25] <thetruenicster> is that Ben Diskin?
[3:33:10] <$Afterman_> ah yes ben diskin actually
[3:33:17] <+MisterAvry> Busting windows in a post apocalypse where you can't just call a window repairman seems expecially egregious
[3:33:26] <$Afterman_> who is shiba from 13 sentinels
[3:33:29] <%Lone_Xeno> You've committed crimes against Skyrim and her people... What say you in your defense?
[3:33:30] <kingofjibs> man is that a Plague of Gripes I hear
[3:33:31] <+MisterAvry> See all that snow?
[3:33:43] <+koalaf1ed> oof
[3:33:48] <thetruenicster> Oh, That Is FUcked
[3:33:50] <%superdeliverer> oh wow that's how they execute
[3:33:54] <%superdeliverer> slow style
[3:33:55] <+MisterAvry> Busting windows is a death sentence when it's freezing out
[3:34:10] <%PinkertonDanPie> oh it'll hurt for a little while
[3:34:13] <+MisterAvry> And you decided to fall in with the redneck blood cult. Fuck off
[3:34:25] <%crimsonharvest> hm well the studio is in socal but it feels like someone writing is from around here
[3:34:37] <%PinkertonDanPie> he was starving! and so was his mom
[3:34:45] <+koalaf1ed> ah yes nothing manlier than dying naked in the snow with your nether bits shrunk.
[3:35:00] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Freezing is easily not even a bad way to go out
[3:35:18] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Youll go numb and feel all warm and fuzzy
[3:35:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[3:35:23] <%shurtal> Zangeif best at seeking
[3:35:23] <$Afterman_> @XeroSigmaPrime i mean not at the end, your mind tricks you
[3:35:28] <%MaddyCaddy> Go freeze and come back to us and tell us how it goes
[3:35:28] <%superdeliverer> freezing is way worse than burning in my mind
[3:35:29] <dan_g_v> shit in pants break?
[3:35:35] <%LadyRarityV> Good Greif Gief psaDogchamp
[3:35:47] <dan_g_v> nig boy gief
[3:35:54] <%cosmosjester> at least it make Pat get up and walk aroudn regulary
[3:35:56] <%superdeliverer> freezing takes a while and you don't feel temperature confusion until very late stages
[3:35:57] <%PinkertonDanPie> I thought burning was one of the worst ways to go
[3:35:57] <+CommandoSanta> psaGib
[3:35:58] <+MisterAvry> Zan-grief
[3:35:59] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Burning to death is WAYYYYY worse than freezing
[3:36:02] <%impulse255dj> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[3:36:02] <SGrim> Oops
[3:36:05] <+koalaf1ed> for sure @superdeliverer
[3:36:15] <kingofjibs> Damn Dan
[3:36:18] <%superdeliverer> burning singes your nerves and you feel nothing after like 2 minutes
[3:36:22] <%CzeekyPlays> monkaS
[3:36:23] <%BallerSwagBro9k> oopsy doo
[3:36:24] <dan_g_v> ... yeah it was, it was big even
[3:36:34] <%shruke> love da baby
[3:36:41] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @superdeliverer Thats BS I can take an ice bath and feel warm in minutes
[3:36:41] <%LadyRarityV> psaBig Oops
[3:36:42] <%PinkertonDanPie> freezing tricks your mind into feeling warm at the end
[3:36:54] <+edited156> What about skinny cats?????
[3:36:58] <+koalaf1ed> nope a stinky puppy girl
[3:37:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @dan_g_v typos always find a way to screw you LUL
[3:37:03] <%OperatorJo_> that's one hell of a typo.
[3:37:04] <+MisterAvry> I get the feeling none of you have either frozen NOR burned to death
[3:37:05] <dan_g_v> shouldn't type in the phone
[3:37:07] <Thetruestblacksun> @superdeliverer What about those 2 minutes? That‚Äôs like, 120 seconds
[3:37:11] <%SirGO0SE> has zangief seen snow yet? how has he reacted?
[3:37:11] <%notgarza> psaDogchamp
[3:37:12] <%strakillias> Who thought it was a good idea to put b and n next to each other on the keyboard. Too much potential for accidental racism
[3:37:13] <%superdeliverer> I can't handle cold also, personally @XeroSigmaPrime
[3:37:17] <kingofjibs> But Pat what if I am the Big Boy?
[3:37:22] <@commanderclaw> Freeze your dick off
[3:37:25] <%toastybites> Isn't this Watkins dude the Gamer President
[3:37:25] <+koalaf1ed> that would be a long 2 minutes
[3:37:30] <%PinkertonDanPie> ooooooof ok that's worse
[3:37:36] <dinnydanny777> Oh well that's fine then NotLikeThis
[3:37:43] <%superdeliverer> @Thetruestblacksun 2 minutes I'd take over 12 hours freezing
[3:38:06] <@commanderclaw> It makes is pp hard
[3:38:06] <%PinkertonDanPie> ACK
[3:38:12] <Fien111> THE LAAAAW
[3:38:17] <+MisterAvry> People who don't like killing don't end up killing a lot of people
[3:38:17] <dinnydanny777> I can't think of a character called Silas in anything who isn't completely evil
[3:38:20] <+MisterAvry> Marshall
[3:38:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Its like comparing a frostbite to a burn. Frostbite is WAYY better than a burn
[3:38:37] <Fien111> Yeah just fucking kill him
[3:38:39] <%rdark_ksu> gulags yay
[3:38:47] <Thetruestblacksun> It‚Äôs a question of the worst pain for a short time or moderate pain to potentially no pain over a longer period
[3:38:55] <dinnydanny777> Oh a work camp I see NotLikeThis
[3:39:03] <%PinkertonDanPie> mmmmm can we kill him?
[3:39:14] <+MisterAvry> I have to side with the Marshall on this one.
[3:39:17] <+abrupt_abe> He makes a good point
[3:39:18] <%DrBunni> holy shit, when you said this was fallout 3, you meant even in the choice of camera angle.
[3:39:29] <+Tucker0603> dude was fucking starving man
[3:39:39] <%MaddyCaddy> Couldn't kiss enough ass
[3:39:40] <+Tucker0603> guardianship
[3:39:44] <%Spydurman> but he's THE COOLEST GUY
[3:39:45] <+wdsimp> Did you remember to grind for butt smooch?
[3:39:48] <+MisterAvry> This isn't our stable and comfy society. Breaking windows in the middle of winter is deadly
[3:39:48] <+Greywyn00> Butt Smooch 4: Much Harder
[3:39:51] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Heres the thing. The pain of burning is like a million times more painful than freezing.
[3:39:52] <%superdeliverer> yeah but this magistrate dude is a bougie bichh
[3:39:56] <+Greywyn00> Munch
[3:39:58] <%FistTheWizard> oh is that how were playing this now?
[3:40:02] <+koalaf1ed> MOney money money
[3:40:14] <%Stealboot7> Stealboot7 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[3:40:17] <%PinkertonDanPie> oh crap
[3:40:20] <%superdeliverer> preacher ass bichh
[3:40:30] <%CzeekyPlays> Thanks for the 2020Wish @stealboot7
[3:40:30] <%MaddyCaddy> I think it's okay as long as you don't leave the area
[3:40:33] <+Slimshazbot> Better scrounge up some scratch soon boy
[3:40:33] <dinnydanny777> @xerosigmaprime I imagine feeling your fingers rot and fall away is pretty painful but okay
[3:40:43] <UlriktheSlayer1> Thanks for the 2020Drop @stealboot7
[3:40:44] <+Tucker0603> this judge is an ass
[3:40:45] <%NovaKnightmare> LAWWWWWWW
[3:40:46] <+MisterAvry> What about the mothers inside those houses he smashed up
[3:40:50] <dukenux> LAAAAWWWWW
[3:40:55] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @dinnydanny777 You wont be feeling it at all XD
[3:40:57] <%DrBunni> this is a full on acab moment.
[3:40:59] <%superdeliverer> but the pain of burning doesn't last as long as the pain of freezing to death
[3:41:00] <Thetruestblacksun> @misteravry I wouldn‚Äôt sacrifice my morals and values though. I‚Äôd rather die breaking him free than let him suffer that kind of fate for wanting to eat
[3:41:04] <Fien111> Uphold the letter of the law while ignoring the spirit, like any good cop!
[3:41:09] <SGrim> Silas isn't wrong, but he is being an asshole about it.
[3:41:12] <dukenux> jesus
[3:41:17] <@commanderclaw> You should sell some junk
[3:41:19] <%PinkertonDanPie> oh gross
[3:41:23] <%superdeliverer> Again though, just a preference thing. I'd prefer to go quick
[3:41:25] <+Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt If you don't leave the area, you can still try to make some cash
[3:41:26] <%crimsonharvest> how hard would it be to murder the judge and his allies
[3:41:27] <%owazowski> I'LL KILL YOU
[3:41:31] <XeroSigmaPrime> @superdeliverer But there is no pain besides the initial cold?
[3:41:44] <%PinkertonDanPie> SAVE HIM PLEASE
[3:41:47] <%superdeliverer> The cold is extremely painful to me
[3:41:51] <%superdeliverer> in my experience
[3:41:51] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @superdeliverer Youll quickly go numb
[3:41:56] <%XeroSigmaPrime> OH
[3:42:04] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Ok I feel you
[3:42:13] <+abrupt_abe> Can't you hot swap characters from your menu?
[3:42:20] <+MisterAvry> @Thetruestblacksun If wanting to eat is an excuse for crimes he might as well have popped off and ate a person
[3:42:22] <dinnydanny777> @xerosigmaprime Frostbite doesn't take particularly long, I imagine you would still feel it
[3:42:23] <dukenux> Freezing to death can be extremely painful
[3:42:27] <+koalaf1ed> Thats a jacked paper boy
[3:42:49] <dukenux> Exposing people to extremely low temperatures is a form of torture
[3:43:11] <+MisterAvry> Or at least shot everyone inside a home and ate all their food. He was starving, it's cool right?
[3:43:11] <+Greywyn00> the pillories are fucked
[3:43:39] <+MisterAvry> Dozens killed, families taken hostage. And he helped
[3:43:43] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Wait, Im not talknig about freezing someone then reviving em
[3:43:47] <dukenux> Like, if they plan to freeze those guys to dead, shooting them might be more merciful
[3:43:49] <%Ranryu692> Plague has ruined the phrase "how does it feel?" for me
[3:43:51] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Im talking about killing someone from freezing
[3:43:56] <Thetruestblacksun> @misteravry Well, no one wants to eat a person and a window can be fixed. Maybe not as easily, but it can be done
[3:43:58] <%MaddyCaddy> There's a market nearby
[3:44:02] <%PinkertonDanPie> its not cool, but it doesn't equate to torture
[3:44:05] <kingofjibs> All you have to do is sell some trash
[3:44:10] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Frostbites are a bitch to recover from, getting them are easy tho
[3:44:16] <+MisterAvry> Instead of maybe going to this town and saying "the Dorsey's are planning an attack and tried to recruit me. I'll tell you all about it for a meal."
[3:44:32] <%NovaKnightmare> What if he gets off on it????
[3:44:44] <%LadyRarityV> LUL roflgatorKek LUL
[3:44:44] <@SSaryn> ITS EXPOSURE FOR FUCKS SAKE
[3:44:45] <Zbyrd0961> frostbite will kill them
[3:44:47] <%PinkertonDanPie> NO I MEANT The boY DOESNT DESERVE TORTURE I MEANT
[3:44:48] <dinnydanny777> LUL
[3:44:49] <%rdark_ksu> They are in subfreezing temps its pretty fucking clear
[3:44:49] <%OperatorJo_> how is PURPOSELY freezing someone not torture? DansGame
[3:44:53] <dukenux> It's a form of torture that's been practiced irl chat, wtf
[3:44:54] <blackbaron98> They are in the snow
[3:44:54] <%LadyRarityV> LOOK AT IT
[3:44:55] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> stop kink shaming him pat
[3:44:57] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @PatStaresAt We're arguing whats worse, death by burning or freezing XD
[3:44:58] <%SirGO0SE> NO RGRT
[3:45:04] <%LadyRarityV> Omg
[3:45:06] <dukenux> Oh ok
[3:45:07] <%PinkertonDanPie> I MEANT HE DIDNT DESERVE IT CRAP
[3:45:11] <%PinkertonDanPie> SORRY
[3:45:16] <%LadyRarityV> Burning
[3:45:16] <%AlteisenReiseZ> oh burning for sure
[3:45:17] <dukenux> Burning is worse yeah
[3:45:18] <Sotetsu> LUL
[3:45:21] <+abrupt_abe> Long term freezing and feeling your skin die though
[3:45:23] <blackbaron98> youll pass out of shock eventually
[3:45:24] <%XeroSigmaPrime> FINALLY, SOMEONE WHO IS SANE
[3:45:26] <%XeroSigmaPrime> WTF
[3:45:27] <@SSaryn> Yeah burning is like.. at least like you're gonna die eventually
[3:45:31] <dukenux> but recovering from frostburns prolly feels awful too
[3:45:33] <%PinkertonDanPie> please don't kill me
[3:45:38] <@SSaryn> Frostbite is just, just take it.
[3:45:43] <%twistingt0rt0ise> Freezing will make you numb after a while.
[3:45:44] <%Ranryu692> burning is worse. when you freeze to death you get to drift off to sleep eventually
[3:45:48] <%XeroSigmaPrime> LITERALLY ALL OF CHAT SAID FREEZING WAS WORSE UNTIL PAT TALKED
[3:45:52] <+blacksuit421> Hello!
[3:45:57] <%OperatorJo_> burning is WAY worse
[3:45:58] <dukenux> Well, with freezing you atleast get hypothermia
[3:46:07] <%shruke> If you die of the freezing it's better, recovering from freezing is gonna suck ass
[3:46:20] <%wibbwobbler> still waiting 4 spontaneous combustion tbh
[3:46:27] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Literally all of you were talking about dying from freezing was worse until Pat talked XD
[3:46:29] <+MisterAvry> @XeroSigmaPrime I get the feeling there are a lot of easily influenced teens in this audience
[3:46:35] <dinnydanny777> Imagine watching your fingers fall off though
[3:46:38] <dukenux> Litteraly no
[3:46:44] <+Hamsh0t> recovering from being burned to death is pretty hard
[3:46:46] <dukenux> i just said it can also be painful
[3:46:46] <%crimsonharvest> wait menus dont pause the game?
[3:46:53] <Paperware> JIMMY NEUTRON!?
[3:46:54] <LunarRemix> God I love everyone's accent in this game
[3:46:54] <dukenux> i never said its more painful
[3:46:56] <Thetruestblacksun> @misteravry Whaaaaat? Nooooo, couldn‚Äôt be
[3:46:59] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Is that Jimmy Neutron?
[3:47:08] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @MisterAvry I made the exact same points as Pat and no one agreed...
[3:47:09] <Thetruestblacksun> But, yea, probably
[3:47:11] <%MaddyCaddy> I wouldn't want to freeze period. That shit is slow and awful.
[3:47:11] <%XeroSigmaPrime> RIP
[3:47:15] <+pectusumbra> Shopkeeper you say

[3:47:37] <anAngryHamster> BRAIN BLAST
[3:47:47] <%crimsonharvest> i noticed his wife's outfit was pretty fancy...
[3:47:51] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Well our lord has spoken. Freezing to death better than burning. Discussion is over XD
[3:47:54] <%owazowski> Depending on how hot the fire is you could just feel nothing from all your nerves being burned off
[3:47:55] <dinnydanny777> Oh god I looked up frostbite on Wikipedia and clicked on compartment syndrome, regret NotLikeThis
[3:48:03] <dukenux> Why is that lady wearing 80s power suit?
[3:48:10] <%Ranryu692> oh shit, Twitter is letting me retweet directly again
[3:48:20] <+Hamsh0t> you're in the doorway of a burning down cabin in the middle of a snowstorm, i don't think anyone's staying inside that cabin
[3:48:20] <%MaddyCaddy> The shop was in front of them, you just walked away from it
[3:48:25] <dukenux> I will shoot litteraly everything inside the shop :)
[3:48:35] <%owazowski> Pat the shops the other way
[3:48:37] <+Slimshazbot> Shame he's a cop
[3:48:38] <Thetruestblacksun> We should have polls for the moral decisions to see where chat stands
[3:48:46] <+red_cuppa> you guys... realize that the most common cause of death from being burned tends to be smoke inhalation right...
[3:48:54] <+MisterAvry> @Hamsh0t Duh, you have a chance in the snow. Fire is coming NOW
[3:48:55] <+teelor32> by the time Pat's done, the shop will be more bullet than shop
[3:48:58] <@SSaryn> He's reasonable in a room full of dumbasses and psychos. Kwan is ok for sure.
[3:49:04] <+Sargonyx> It's Alphys!
[3:49:05] <%owazowski> Too bad he's a snitch ass liasion

[3:56:15] <%king_wragles> Someone needs to talk to Twitch about how much they've been drinking lately
[3:56:15] <+pectusumbra> Yare Yare fucking daze
[3:56:17] <$Futurecity10> That was worried really badly
[3:56:19] <%toastybites> the problem of having monopolies on things
[3:56:21] <dinnydanny777> I'm confused, don't Twitch make most of the money from those ads
[3:56:22] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Pat Stares at OnlyFans when?
[3:56:24] <%DrBunni> so whats the streaming alternative
[3:56:27] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Man, Im missing Mixer more and more
[3:56:29] <rekinom> ***
[3:56:32] <Sotetsu> Let's make our own streaming platform! With blackjack! And hookers!
[3:56:37] <+PenmanLupine> Twitch really started feeling itself after Mixer flopped
[3:56:41] <%king_wragles> IS THIS A TRUE GRIT REFERENCE
[3:56:49] <%toastybites> Stream on chaturbate
[3:56:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> Patreon time!
[3:56:57] <%SirGO0SE> man those $2 in ad revenue for an 8 hour stream are really killing streamers
[3:56:58] <$realm_forge> Ok let‚Äôs be real. Who here would pay fir Oats butt pics if it came down to it Yay or Nay?
[3:57:04] <%OperatorJo_> twitch really abusig their position huh
[3:57:06] <HorribleHog> the world is so ready for a new platform
[3:57:12] <+MisterAvry> I'd refuse to help when she said "leading families" Fuck you, richy
[3:57:13] <HorribleHog> but who will make it happen?
[3:57:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Chaturbate is lowkey a better platform now
[3:57:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yeah Lucia kinda sucks
[3:57:39] <+Tucker0603> @realm_forge excuse me, WUT?!
[3:57:45] <LorcaNomad> This girl is up her own ass so hard tho
[3:57:48] <LunarRemix> She has an interesting quest though
[3:57:49] <dukenux> Ah yes, the sacred lineage
[3:57:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ugh
[3:57:52] <Sotetsu> I like Lucia. She's interesting.
[3:57:52] <+MisterAvry> She's one of those assholes with a "native" bumper sticker
[3:57:52] <%wibbwobbler> that sucks man
[3:58:09] <%thetrashman_sc> yall loooooooooove your first impressions smh
[3:58:12] <$realm_forge> @tucker0603 my auto correct fucking hates me
[3:58:16] <Zebroneath> called out
[3:58:27] <+teelor32> "hey, look at the accomplishments of my ancestors, now apply them to me"
[3:58:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> She just SCREAMS Rich Puritan Virgin
[3:58:48] <%superdeliverer> Who's Oats
[3:58:52] <@SSaryn> And being washed in blood. of Lambs.
[3:58:54] <rekinom> Let me make it more clear: Twitch said that THEY don't pay streamers for ads that are blocked. Not that advertisers don't pay
[3:59:07] <+MisterAvry> Just go tell the Dorseys how totally important you are
[3:59:07] <dukenux> "I hate those Dorsey Boys, OH HOW I HATE THEM"
[3:59:13] <+Tucker0603> talk with sheiff daisy now
[3:59:15] <%crimsonharvest> Yes, the society sounds like it's descended from evangelical fundies
[3:59:18] <dukenux> Oh no,
[3:59:19] <Sotetsu> They've been inbreeding.
[3:59:21] <+Tucker0603> damn, ok
[3:59:28] <dukenux> She demands to speak to the mana- sheriff
[3:59:29] <+MisterAvry> @crimsonharvest It IS the Springs
[3:59:34] <rekinom> This game looks great
[3:59:38] <@SSaryn> Fair
[3:59:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYYEYE
[3:59:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Nooooooooo
[3:59:43] <+Tucker0603> i fucking love this game
[3:59:44] <%MaddyCaddy> It's a great game to play by yourself
[3:59:45] <%MoguManda> thanks for the fun stream!
[3:59:48] <@SSaryn> Also fair.
[3:59:51] <%FistTheWizard> it is very long and slow burn
[3:59:52] <%LadyRarityV> Mmmmmmmhmmmm
[3:59:54] <UlriktheSlayer1> this was fun tho
[3:59:59] <$realm_forge> @superdeliverer Oats is a fictional character my auto correct seems hellbent on shoehorning into my life
[4:00:04] <Zebroneath> A lot more fucking bullshit
[4:00:06] <%OperatorJo_> buckle up
[4:00:07] <$slawson619> WE LOVE YOU PATRICK
[4:00:11] <%crimsonharvest> yeah @MisterAvry just trying not to name drop any specific party you know
[4:00:11] <%Ranryu692> This game is interesting, but I have been having trouble paying attention
[4:00:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> StopDMCA is trending on Twitter
[4:00:30] <%XeroSigmaPrime> XD Shroud just mentioned how it might be time to abandon ship with Twitch
[4:00:31] <%bevyrage> hey pat so i've been looking into alternative streaming sites and it looks like onlyfans is the best opportunity for streamers right now.
[4:00:33] <DrkJP520> You can become a body paint streamer. Is that still allowed?
[4:00:39] <%MoguManda> here we go indeed
[4:00:45] <+TurnipKupo> looooool
[4:00:50] <%DrBunni> wait can you stream on onlyfans
[4:00:54] <%superdeliverer> I see
[4:00:54] <+Hamsh0t> his pepperonis are way too big to cover in paint
[4:01:06] <+MisterAvry> @crimsonharvest Why not? It's not like they'd show you the same tact.
[4:01:13] <%bevyrage> yeah you can stream on onlyfans, and it's basically twitch methods from five years ago
[4:01:18] <@commanderclaw> They claim that context matters, but people don't believe them
[4:01:20] <rekinom> There's a clip of twitch employees talking about it on stream @PatStaresAt
[4:01:30] <+pectusumbra> what about plexstorm?
[4:01:32] <Blank9> I still don't get what they changed that will actually CHANGE anything.
[4:01:41] <%crimsonharvest> thanks for reminding me misteravry i need to unlearn that shit
[4:01:47] <Zeikier> context is such a nebulous useless pile of nothing
[4:02:05] <+MisterAvry> Man, I just kinda started getting into Twitch.
[4:02:07] <rekinom> Sent 'em
[4:02:17] <SomersaultJustice> how do you prove stream sniping anyway?
[4:02:19] <%crimsonharvest> wait they banned ironic racism explicitly?
[4:02:19] <Psyramics> who gets banned if you stream snipe? how do they ban a viewer?
[4:02:27] <%crimsonharvest> cool
[4:02:30] <%Puhff> the confederate flag wasn't abnned? LUL
[4:02:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> How tf do you stop stream sniping?
[4:02:38] <@commanderclaw> In a mere 6 months from now!
[4:02:38] <%ultimatetotoro> so
[4:02:43] <%SirGO0SE> Twitch has put themselves in a position where if a competitor like Mixer had appeared *now* they'd have to fight for their userbase
[4:02:51] <Sotetsu> To be fair, context DOES matter. Like, what was the context of Twitch's statement?
[4:02:55] <anAngryHamster> The Confederate colors don't run, they surrender
[4:02:58] <%vaporousTippler> Are US Civil War games banned now? Like, all two of them?
[4:02:58] <@SoFarFetched> I think they mean if you don't have an account
[4:03:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Oh ok
[4:03:03] <%Ipsenscastle> I mean context is always important, but in terms of content moderation it's completely impossible to account for
[4:03:04] <$realm_forge> Bruce Banner is now banned
[4:03:06] <%toastybites> "Why do chemo when you can pretend you don't have breast cancer"
[4:03:08] <@SoFarFetched> or not following
[4:03:11] <%ultimatetotoro> what's it like to become a criminal for simply doing your job, suddenly overnight?
[4:03:11] <%SirGO0SE> when competitors popped up last year the userbase laughed, now theyre begging. someone will come and collect the money on the table
[4:03:15] <%crimsonharvest> yeah the environment is ripe for competiton
[4:03:21] <%NeonBleu> Maybe Mixer should come back.....
[4:03:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I thought it was if the Streamer was being stream sniped
[4:03:29] <%ultimatetotoro> or almost suddenly I guess
[4:03:32] <@commanderclaw> skimp
[4:03:35] <@SoFarFetched> Gamer
[4:03:35] <NeroInfinite> Twitch is sounding less and less fun to stream on.
[4:03:36] <theanora1> Can't harass your wife on Dark Souls anymore?
[4:03:36] <%cvp5127> fimp
[4:03:36] <Mr_Strut> Jimp?

[4:03:45] <Sotetsu> Call them sinps
[4:03:45] <Zeltallica> simp
[4:03:47] <dinnydanny777> I remember when that word used to mean simpleton
[4:03:48] <%caramelatte1> Simp is like the most harmless thing.
[4:03:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Bimp
[4:03:49] <%wibbwobbler> white knight
[4:03:50] <NeroInfinite> G A M E R S rise up
[4:03:51] <+Homebutton33> shrimp
[4:03:53] <%wibbwobbler> beta
[4:03:54] <%Puhff> s1mp

[4:03:56] <kulmoth> shrimp
[4:03:56] <blackbaron98> nah sime is OLD
[4:03:58] <%cvp5127> simpe Kappa
[4:03:58] <%wibbwobbler> cuck
[4:04:00] <Mr_Strut> Did it come from no sympy?
[4:04:00] <%bevyrage> simp actually existed for a good five years iirc, but it just caught on for slang
[4:04:02] <Blank9> they'll just go with the longform, simpleton
[4:04:03] <@SoFarFetched> TIME TO BRING SIMPLETON BACK
[4:04:04] <Torgue_1> somp
[4:04:04] <%Puhff> cimp
[4:04:04] <+MisterAvry> This reminds me of teachers in elementary school scrambling to control the children and the things they say and think.
[4:04:05] <aretos1> shrimp is good
[4:04:06] <%crimsonharvest> yeah we already had words for simp
[4:04:06] <%TheNewJapanGuy> its been on 4chan awhile
[4:04:07] <%notgarza> Imagine Mixer with the comeback
[4:04:08] <%Aeoneth> Thirstyboy
[4:04:09] <boywunderkind> simp has to be like a year old
[4:04:09] <@SSaryn> Kind of
[4:04:10] <+Jaromero435> Gamers should be a protected group Kappa
[4:04:11] <%SirGO0SE> pls no twimpy
[4:04:12] <%kyh9> Twitch banning it is just the Mods bitching
[4:04:15] <SCIENCE_25> Next one will be Stan. I'm bettin.
[4:04:16] <Broken_Sonex> White Knight is a good one. They'll go back to that
[4:04:17] <%Ranryu692> start saying "twitch" instead and dare them to ban that
[4:04:17] <NeroInfinite> cuck is also pretty fast. Kappa
[4:04:17] <redrins> I remember when simp meant something else
[4:04:21] <%BubbaRands> S tier Imps
[4:04:21] <%kyh9> The twitchthot mods are pathetic
[4:04:22] <%Daxalog> Just say the full word now.
[4:04:25] <%Puhff> Jeff Bezos is a simp for money, ban me twitch
[4:04:26] <%cvp5127> can turn twitch into a slur
[4:04:30] <Sotetsu> I've only seen simps used positively through HoloLive stuff.
[4:04:36] <Torgue_1> But you would be out of a job! Kappa
[4:04:40] <dukenux> they banned "simp" but "cuck" is still allowed?
[4:04:44] <%blistexthief> Stop right there, criminal scum
[4:04:48] <NeroInfinite> I'llsimp for korone
[4:04:51] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> you can literally be reported while LIVE ffs
[4:04:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> simps: a man being nice to a girl exclusively with the hope of getting into he pants
[4:04:58] <dinnydanny777> Fun fact: a Twitcher is a bird watcher :)
[4:04:58] <anAngryHamster> twitch might as well ban people for calling each other babies
[4:05:03] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Yea Cuck isnt bannable tho XD
[4:05:05] <@SoFarFetched> But what if I say Virgin Olive Oil
[4:05:08] <%king_wragles> No, BE ASHAMED OF BEING A VIRGIN APPARENTLY
[4:05:10] <huskarl_zap> verginmobile
[4:05:10] <$realm_forge> Is Picarto any good?
[4:05:11] <Doomstar16> Oh hell yeah I caught a stream.
[4:05:12] <%cvp5127> someone at twitch felt attacked
[4:05:13] <%UvBenServed> The V***** Mary
[4:05:16] <dukenux> that's what "incel" is precisely used for
[4:05:17] <%Aeoneth> Didn't they want people to use virgin playthrough to supplant blind playthrough?
[4:05:18] <%Hiro01231> banning it implies it is an insult and only an insult
[4:05:19] <%BubbaRands> Remember when "Simp" meant "simpleton"?
[4:05:20] <+MisterAvry> So much for the ****** Islands
[4:05:20] <ergulor> Represed italians
[4:05:21] <Psyramics> What if someone asks what I'm drinking and I'm drinking a virgin bloody mary?
[4:05:21] <dukenux> which was also banned
[4:05:22] <+Hamsh0t> what if you're from virginia?
[4:05:25] <wibbwobbler> oh no
[4:05:25] <Mr_Strut> Pocket Circuit Fighter is now banned
[4:05:26] <+Jaromero435> This virgin olive oil

[4:05:28] <%baka_sugoi> gamer virgin
[4:05:28] <@commanderclaw> Good to know I'm now in a protected group thanks to my lack of game
[4:05:33] <dukenux> I could be an Extra Virgin Oil
[4:05:34] <+abrupt_abe> Does this mean Kiryu is banned?
[4:05:34] <%crimsonharvest> nah simp has gotta be from 'simper'
[4:05:35] <+Hamsh0t> CLOSE ENOUGH
[4:05:35] <$Afterman_> i like how they only grabbed terms that affect men, nothing for violence against women
[4:05:35] <dukenux> what now?
[4:05:39] <@SoFarFetched> @realm_forge picarto sucks as plague has had horrible headaches with it cause vods may or may not save depending how picarto feels.
[4:05:40] <%impulse255dj> Richard Branson be screwed then

[4:05:51] <Mr_Strut> The clown world don't stop!
[4:05:56] <NeroInfinite> @realm_forge Picarto doesnt'a llow nonart stuff to be the stream focus.
[4:05:59] <+yoshkosh20> call Virginians virgins cause you're really lazy
[4:06:01] <Broken_Sonex> People will just go back to Simpleton instead of Simp
[4:06:02] <%twistingt0rt0ise> You mean I can't talk about olive oil now?
[4:06:03] <dukenux> West [REDACTED], Mountain Mama
[4:06:06] <$realm_forge> @sofarfetched shit...
[4:06:06] <DrkJP520> what about virgin oil?
[4:06:10] <dinnydanny777> People do that?
[4:06:10] <%Daxalog> Virginite
[4:06:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Welp RIP VIRGINIA
[4:06:11] <+Tucker0603> ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?!?!??!
[4:06:12] <+yoshkosh20> can't bother to add that last syllable
[4:06:14] <%Hiro01231> NotLikeThis

[4:06:14] <+Jaromero435> NO MORE OLIVE OIL
[4:06:16] <@SoFarFetched> VIRGINIA
[4:06:21] <%TheNewJapanGuy> oooof
[4:06:22] <+pectusumbra> This is fucking dumb
[4:06:23] <ammobasket> context does not matter, apparantly
[4:06:24] <Mr_Strut> Honk
[4:06:25] <+JJMR322> so people from the virgin islands are now from THE Islands?
[4:06:26] <%BubbaRands> You can't even burn yourself anymore?!
[4:06:26] <%SirGO0SE> @toastybites or Madonna's "Like a Virgin
[4:06:27] <$slawson619> I watched an ECW pay per view from the 90's and saw a DEEZ NUTS sign in the crowd, now I need to know the real origin
[4:06:27] <theanora1> will you get banned for calling yourself trash?
[4:06:29] <%Puhff> picarto still won't send me a validation email so i can join chat soooo, yeah
[4:06:34] <dinnydanny777> Twitch hates virgins confirmed?
[4:06:41] <dukenux> RIP Virgin Mary
[4:06:45] <%LadyRarityV> Twitch really be on crack 24/7 these days
[4:06:46] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> Mayhaps twitch isn't your friend
[4:06:47] <$realm_forge> Twitch will ban you for self deprecating humor?
[4:06:47] <HeroToxiko> Twitch loves fucking people over without actually doing anything good
[4:06:52] <dukenux> YEAH, I ASKED BOUT THAT
[4:06:52] <%cvp5127> is ntr banned?
[4:06:52] <$Futurecity10> Simp is now cuck
[4:06:53] <%CzeekyPlays> Ban all incels
[4:06:59] <%caramelatte1> Salior moon meme time
[4:06:59] <%Puhff> neither is cunt!
[4:07:02] <%SirGO0SE> but cuck is an old term that they understand Kappa
[4:07:03] <+ItalianWaifu> nah twitch admins are part of those fetishes so they are cool
[4:07:04] <@SSaryn> This is the council shit. I can guarantee it.
[4:07:05] <%MaddyCaddy> Just don't use the ones I don't like >:(
[4:07:06] <%UvBenServed> Is "boomer" still good?
[4:07:06] <%BubbaRands> Well "Cuck" is a refined term Kappa
[4:07:12] <%shruke> Virgin Mary is over, time for Cuck Joseph
[4:07:12] <%blistexthief> Virgins are worse than cucks, according to Twitch
[4:07:12] <rekinom> In the town hall they said "terms referring to a person's sexual activity"
[4:07:12] <+abrupt_abe> Are we back to white knighting and cucks again?
[4:07:13] <Blank9> dummy
[4:07:14] <huskarl_zap> incels rise to drive on the sidewalks
[4:07:15] <+Jaromero435> but we can still use stuff like slut, whore, etc? Kappa
[4:07:15] <%IDTheftVictim> IDTheftVictim subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Oh God I've grown two years older in this time
[4:07:16] <Torgue_1> *chat vanishes*
[4:07:18] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Okay time to switch to cuck
[4:07:19] <+armormog> i think the australians would complain if cunt was banned
[4:07:20] <Mr_Strut> I thought simp replaced cuck because people got bored of the latter
[4:07:20] <dinnydanny777> Huh, the actual c word isn't banned?
[4:07:22] <%wibbwobbler> people can get creative
[4:07:22] <8hoursofdrugs> perhaps some of the twitch admins personally identify with the banned words
[4:07:22] <%toastybites> @Puhff they would have to ban all of australia if they do that
[4:07:25] <Sotetsu> As a virgin, it bothers me that that word is banned.
[4:07:25] <$realm_forge> What about fupa?
[4:07:26] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> Nincompoop!
[4:07:31] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> Scallywag

[4:07:34] <@SSaryn> Where we have to just make up words?
[4:07:36] <Torgue_1> Knave!
[4:07:36] <dinnydanny777> People start spamming chats with the word "wench"
[4:07:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SHITS FUCKED YO
[4:07:41] <+ItalianWaifu> i got a English degree to be a dick
[4:07:43] <%SirGO0SE> time for frussy to rise up
[4:07:43] <%toastybites> that does sound nicer tbh
[4:07:44] <huskarl_zap> V*rgin
[4:07:45] <Psyramics> Let's go ask a historian what the 1800s version of simp was
[4:07:45] <%owazowski> Is FUTA banned??
[4:07:47] <%arcielardor> a very cromulent move
[4:07:48] <HeroToxiko> fucking hilarious how the council turned out to be Non-Chads
[4:07:49] <Gregorhasjoined> Words, we made em up
[4:07:50] <%BubbaRands> Milquetoast

[4:08:05] <%Pappajimbo> you sir are a pompinjay
[4:08:05] <huskarl_zap> who the fuck complained about simp
[4:08:07] <+Jaromero435> THIS HELPS NOTHING
[4:08:12] <%LadyRarityV> Yup
[4:08:12] <%impulse255dj> bounder, cad and scoundrel will be making a big come back
[4:08:14] <$realm_forge> Most uncouth roustabouts!

[4:09:12] <anAngryHamster> no use word, gestate wildly
[4:09:19] <Flux530> Pat‚Äôs desktop background is a bannable offense
[4:09:27] <dinnydanny777> Why are Twitch anti virgin anyway, isn't that the majority of their user base Kappa
[4:09:30] <$Futurecity10> Next tos update is you're straight up banned if you're white
[4:09:33] <+ItalianWaifu> DMCA color
[4:09:33] <Mr_Strut> So whenever they feel like it
[4:09:34] <%CzeekyPlays> So... don't harass people. Got it
[4:09:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> Is Binet
[4:09:36] <Sotetsu> That seems more reasonable
[4:09:39] <%Hiro01231> So only sorta banned?
[4:09:42] <%blistexthief> You'll get no sympy from me
[4:09:43] <Blank9> how about just ban people who harass you in the first place
[4:09:43] <Psyramics> So MrFeel calling a VN protag a simp repeatedly won't be an issue?
[4:09:47] <Sotetsu> Harassment is harassment.
[4:09:52] <dukenux> So a blanket ban
[4:09:56] <HeroToxiko> "we're gonna ban you for random things and won
[4:09:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> Is binky dick against the tos?
[4:09:59] <Visorak6> why would they put it out there being vague means they can wipe their ass legally for anything
[4:09:59] <@SSaryn> So cuck IS banned. I assume.
[4:10:03] <HeroToxiko> 't give you a list"
[4:10:09] <%shruke> It seems like it's just justification to ban harassers and brigadeers
[4:10:13] <$realm_forge> I say we start using Shakespearean insults again. That shit was basically the South Park of its day
[4:10:14] <%UvBenServed> So they made it vague as shit so they can enforce it whenever the hell they want. Cool
[4:10:17] <boywunderkind> so long as they don't name the words, they're allowed to ban people for any reason
[4:10:18] <%Puhff> @rumtumtugnutz god i hope not
[4:10:20] <dukenux> : ^ )
[4:10:21] <Torgue_1> People get creative with emotes
[4:10:21] <%Noogiez> ban everything
[4:10:22] <@SoFarFetched> and people use certain emotes for specific things
[4:10:23] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> The adverts are harassment tho

[4:10:44] <+armormog> atpBigot atpBigot
[4:10:45] <+Jaromero435> would 4 separate emotes of S, I, M, and P be banned?
[4:10:45] <%Hiro01231> hence the banning of letters
[4:10:45] <dukenux> Yeah...
[4:10:46] <%SirGO0SE> Honestly, most importantly, has Twitch asked how the simps feel? They're taking their identifier away
[4:10:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Some emotes are pretty raunchy too
[4:10:46] <@SoFarFetched> like that one
[4:10:47] <ergulor> a banana for example

[4:11:12] <@SSaryn> It's a slope NO ONE, not even Twitch themselves can get around.
[4:11:14] <%Mrbaconator> twitch is good at virtue signaling it seems @PatStaresAt

[4:11:35] <Torgue_1> Isn't TriHard also one?
[4:11:36] <NitronStreams> honestly the one good thing about youtube is it seems you can only use a channels emotes on that *** would be nice if the was an option
[4:11:37] <%BubbaRands> Just don't say anything 4Head
[4:11:39] <%shruke> Time for the return of: I bite my thumb at thee
[4:11:42] <@SoFarFetched> yeah @Torgue_1
[4:11:42] <%LadyRarityV> TriHard is used a lot for gross racial stuff
[4:11:47] <%SirGO0SE> they're CHALLENGING people
[4:11:48] <%Aeoneth> Grammatical Arms Race
[4:11:49] <huskarl_zap> turn the name pat into a slur

[4:12:04] <+ItalianWaifu> its just the legal team saying we tried so they can cover there own asses
[4:12:06] <$Futurecity10> Twitch staff sucl
[4:12:08] <NeroInfinite> Yeah
[4:12:09] <+Gespens> Did I miss game or are we just talking about the stupid ToS stuff in break?
[4:12:09] <%UvBenServed> I FORGOT ABOUT THAT
[4:12:12] <+MisterAvry> I wish so many people didn't insist on being fucking assholes, though. Then this stuff wouldn't even be thought of
[4:12:13] <%Mrbaconator> yeah but people that have nothing to do with it get to FEEL like they did something!
[4:12:14] <HeroToxiko> A pr bullshit move to distract from their shitt everything
[4:12:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WORDS THAT KILL
[4:12:21] <theanora1> it also doesn't address the whole DMCA felony thing
[4:12:24] <boywunderkind> i dunno about using the phrase "virtue signal" i think it's just liability
[4:12:29] <@SSaryn> Even though they've done everything but that.
[4:12:30] <@commanderclaw> That would cost money
[4:12:35] <+Shacklebox> that would cost money
[4:12:35] <%shruke> @Gespens game done for today
[4:12:36] <Torgue_1> Yeah, but they wouldn't ban for using "blind playthrough", right?
[4:12:36] <HeroToxiko> But that would Take MONEY LUL
[4:12:37] <%Hiro01231> Nope, just make more automods
[4:12:37] <Visorak6> But pat that would be actually doing something about the problem
[4:12:42] <Sotetsu> But they won't create a "Trans" tag, which the trans community really wants.
[4:12:44] <%Puhff> but that would cost money Kappa
[4:12:45] <dinnydanny777> If they ban the word simp, how will I make Simpsons references, this is the Scunthorpe problem all over again NotLikeThis
[4:12:53] <rekinom> They should spend some of that withheld ad money on more mods
[4:12:54] <%Puhff> and Bezos no spend money
[4:12:55] <$realm_forge> BUT JEFF BEZOS NEEDS A 4TH YACHT
[4:12:56] <%Puhff> only make
[4:13:05] <Mr_Strut> Why spend money when you can manipulate public opinion for cheap?
[4:13:08] <%CzeekyPlays> "Imagine making your company and service better! Couldn't be me." - Twitch
[4:13:10] <HeroToxiko> @Torgue_1 specifically for that they would
[4:13:14] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Did you see that calling someone a simp is now a TOS ban
[4:13:17] <HeroToxiko> YUP
[4:13:25] <%PinkertonDanPie> Cheer500 Hi Pat Im Pinkerton's wife (who commented before and use his account sometimes) never meant exposure wasn't torture. Im just a doofus and suck at writing, my bad.
[4:13:26] <%PinkertonDanPie> PinkertonDanPie's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[4:13:29] <Sotetsu> What a crock, Amazon is made of money.
[4:13:36] <Blank9> the dark souls 2 knight solaire problem is still the most hilarious one I can think of
[4:13:37] <%QueequegTheater> Look, I never claimed I was a smart man
[4:13:39] <NeroInfinite> So what you're saying pat, is we should EAT Jeff Bezos.
[4:13:40] <huskarl_zap> pemis
[4:13:50] <dinnydanny777> I feel like this is the opposite of YouTube being an absolute wasteland of toxicity
[4:13:50] <anAngryHamster> @queequegtheater We are twenty minutes into the discussion
[4:13:53] <LorcaNomad> twitch doesn't have amazon's money tho
[4:13:55] <Visorak6> if twitch doesnt make money why did they buy twitch
[4:13:56] <rekinom> I sent you the link on twitter @PatStaresAt
[4:14:00] <%Mrbaconator> so are you saying jeff bezos is a simp?
[4:14:01] <%QueequegTheater> But I just got here
[4:14:02] <dukenux> Amazon been raking in huge money this pandemic
[4:14:06] <rekinom> Yeah
[4:14:17] <%Puhff> @QueequegTheater you get in the corner now!
[4:14:35] <HeroToxiko> twitch is a money pile that amazon vacuums
[4:14:39] <+armormog> they bought twitch because it's a massive platform they can push the shit that does make money
[4:14:46] <%Stormzcales_Lair> lies
[4:14:49] <HeroToxiko> Because he is lying LUL
[4:14:50] <dinnydanny777> Don't Twitch take the vast majority of ad money?
[4:14:51] <Blank9> I tried going without adblock last night while max streamed hades
[4:14:52] <%king_wragles> But...... Twitch doesn't share the majority of ad revenue with said streamers?
[4:14:52] <%Hiro01231> only really big streamers get ad revenue
[4:14:52] <anAngryHamster> Corporations don't need revenue, they need investors. The economy is stupid
[4:14:53] <$realm_forge> The only thing I know about twitch ads is that they‚Äôre annoying as fuck and about 3 x louder as the actual stream
[4:14:59] <Sotetsu> How does Twitch not make money? Dont they get 30-50% of subs?
[4:15:01] <%CzeekyPlays> Twitch is "exposure bucks" made reality
[4:15:02] <%OperatorJo_> that's HUGE lies
[4:15:03] <%LadyRarityV> ????
[4:15:04] <%king_wragles> Like 70% of that revenue just goes to Twitch doesn't it?
[4:15:04] <Visorak6> They need to stop pretending this is about the streamer, this is absolutely about the ad companies
[4:15:05] <+Slimshazbot> Stream over?
[4:15:07] <Blank9> on his first time getting to Hades himself, it decided to roll 10 ads in a row
[4:15:11] <dinnydanny777> It's just anti consumer really
[4:15:27] <Blank9> never again
[4:15:28] <%QueequegTheater> Also, Twitch ads have recently started to get through my uBlock
[4:15:31] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> when are streamers unionising already, they're getting screwed quite a bit lately
[4:15:36] <NeroInfinite> Streamers like patmake literal pennies fromtwitchads.
[4:15:37] <HeroToxiko> As a person who went to school for pr, I despise pr people
[4:15:41] <dan_g_v> what did I come back to?
[4:15:44] <%Daxalog> Oh no the 6 cents
[4:15:45] <%BubbaRands> Man, this week's podcast is gonna be interesting! LUL
[4:15:46] <anAngryHamster> How long until it's illegal to not look at billboards by the road
[4:15:49] <%thelaxinator> Most Ads I see on Twitch are for Amazon products. They're trying to empower their own advertisements for their own products.
[4:15:54] <%QueequegTheater> @dan_g_v Twitch is killing itself
[4:15:54] <%wibbwobbler> probably a reaction to being accused of playing favorites
[4:15:54] <%OperatorJo_> ok so blanket ban
[4:16:02] <dinnydanny777> Yeah this is 100% because the ad companies are angry about their ads not being seen
[4:16:14] <%baka_sugoi> secret ban
[4:16:14] <LorcaNomad> JUST GOES TO SHOW HOW BAD AN IDEA IT IS
[4:16:16] <dukenux> yeah, this is just shotgun approach again
[4:16:26] <%shruke> yeah twitch's team has been on top of adblocks like every week it feels
[4:16:33] <dukenux> Moist
[4:16:40] <+Gespens> YuGiOh cards
[4:16:43] <@commanderclaw> Yu Gi Oh I think
[4:16:43] <LorcaNomad> pokemon yea
[4:16:44] <%Mrbaconator> yughioh
[4:16:44] <NeroInfinite> yeah
[4:16:46] <%baka_sugoi> cards
[4:16:47] <dinnydanny777> Didn't Twitch try to introduce a bunch of new ads earlier this year? This is most likely a continuation of that.
[4:16:47] <%QueequegTheater> Pokemon/Yugioh
[4:16:49] <theanora1> yep
[4:16:49] <redrins> its both
[4:16:51] <Torgue_1> Yugioh

[4:16:56] <NeroInfinite> Both
[4:16:58] <dukenux> Children's Card Games
[4:16:58] <%SirGO0SE> @dinnydanny777 they must get furious when they look at analytics and see people closing the platform after the first second of an ad
[4:17:00] <%BubbaRands> It's both really
[4:17:00] <%baka_sugoi> cardboard carck
[4:17:01] <%bread_assassin> Well.both

[4:17:27] <%QueequegTheater> clout
[4:17:28] <rekinom> Let's make "twitch" analogous to "simp" so they ban it
[4:17:32] <SCIENCE_25> Straight to jail
[4:17:39] <%BubbaRands> "You're a third rate duelist with a fourth rate deck!"
[4:17:40] <+holygodemperor> I for one am impressed how many suicide attempts twitch has survived
[4:17:40] <HeroToxiko> Kaiba is. Simping. For blue eyes white dragon. for example
[4:17:46] <%Mrbaconator> straight to prison
[4:17:53] <dinnydanny777> @sirgo0se Yep, exactly, if no one watches the ads it's a waste of money for them as far as they're concerned, advertisements are often designed to be as obnoxious as possible
[4:17:58] <%QueequegTheater> Cr1tikal has clout that Jimmy Streamer the 15-year-old can't even dream of having
[4:18:00] <anAngryHamster> The man has a jet shaped like a Blue Eyes
[4:18:02] <Torgue_1> As seen by the Youtube staff interview
[4:18:03] <HeroToxiko> I thought ingame tiddies weren't bannable tho
[4:18:04] <Blank9> can you weaponize the word "sub" as a replacement for simp
[4:18:11] <%Daxalog> If your a no one you get screwed.

[4:18:38] <+koalaf1ed> facebook gaming
[4:18:39] <%SirGO0SE> and now look at Cyber Punk and the leniency given. Vinny only got banned because it was a mod and mods dont payoff twitch to keep their game on

[4:19:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> You have 85k followers tho
[4:19:14] <%Aeoneth> You'll let us know when you jump ship right?
[4:19:17] <%OperatorJo_> Pat is a B-tier streamer. The B stands for Bald, of course.
[4:19:19] <+pectusumbra> It's getting to the point that we're going to need a class action lawsuit soon

[4:20:03] <%toastybites> F to people playing Phasmophobia
[4:20:08] <%QueequegTheater> It'll probably be Jerma
[4:20:14] <%SirGO0SE> XQC will be targeted in seconds
[4:20:16] <%QueequegTheater> Calling my shot now
[4:20:17] <%Shady_Squid> Just got here, what has twitch done?
[4:20:22] <dinnydanny777> Twitch probably directly profits from awful people LUL
[4:20:30] <geckko12> that's pretty much how it goes
[4:20:31] <%QueequegTheater> @Shady_Squid Using simp as an insult is now a ban
[4:20:33] <Blank9> it'll be a 10k viewer stream watching a youtube video they're taken down for
[4:20:42] <%bigbrothergannon> faccccccccts
[4:20:43] <HeroToxiko> And they won't unban anyone as a result LUL
[4:20:51] <+koalaf1ed> Yep like anything else its a swinging pendulum
[4:20:52] <ShadeTheNovice> but we still have to go through that bullshit process
[4:20:53] <Profmcstevie> They won't threaten their MONEY lytMONEY
[4:20:58] <%Puhff> yeh
[4:20:58] <+Gespens> It's gonna be like, Bahroo or OfflineTV who gets hit by it or something
[4:20:59] <huskarl_zap> Licensed approved corporate streams only
[4:21:00] <LorcaNomad> this is what enforcing virtue signaling will get you
[4:21:01] <%UvBenServed> Oh good, roadmaps
[4:21:03] <%Shady_Squid> @QueequegTheater lol what. oh man thats goofy
[4:21:05] <Blank9> ~road map~
[4:21:14] <%SirGO0SE> @QueequegTheater let's start a pool LUL
[4:21:23] <%Mrbaconator> ROAD. MAP.
[4:21:28] <+King_floppy> is this another step taken by that |Twitch Council| we heard about in the beginning of the year?
[4:21:45] <+BallerSwagBro9k> TWITCH: POINTLESS LUL
[4:21:47] <huskarl_zap> internet is being made into Turner Vision 2
[4:21:55] <Profmcstevie> Swap those legal stuff to the front Twitch ya fucks
[4:22:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS 1984 WHOOOOOO
[4:22:08] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Is it a legal requirement for all Twitch, or just the streamers who are American (and thus legally subject to the actual DMCA)?
[4:22:09] <dukenux> well, next year- oh
[4:22:14] <dinnydanny777> This is 100% put into unintelligible legal language so that most people can't understand it LUL
[4:22:20] <LorcaNomad> I hate the people in charge of this website
[4:22:21] <Visorak6> What are right anyway knowsayin?
[4:22:23] <%SirGO0SE> cant wait to catch my favorite streamers on the dark web where i buy all my hookers
[4:22:24] <+Doggyperro> So instead of doing anything useful theyve decided to ban the word simp
[4:22:24] <%QuipSan> Twitch is fucked
[4:22:26] <%OperatorJo_> if you're NOT checking for context and tone in a sentence/statement for using bannable words might as well use a bot to BOP immediately I mean why even have people looking at the messages if it's a blanket ban
[4:22:34] <orcstr16> You might legit be better off streaming on youtube at this point
[4:22:34] <a_mad_dragon> they're just too busy trying to beat the twitch adblock extension
[4:22:37] <Mr_Strut> Are we gonna see more weird streaming sites now? I hope so.
[4:22:40] <Blank9> they just want to pay their administrative/legal team that's not doing anything
[4:22:50] <orcstr16> At least you can respond to dmca bullshit on youtube
[4:22:52] <LorcaNomad> because it's an american company
[4:22:53] <dinnydanny777> Twitch is American I think so it doesn't matter
[4:22:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THATS FUCKED
[4:22:58] <Profmcstevie> American service~
[4:22:59] <dukenux> You're using an american platform, so it's beholden to american law
[4:22:59] <%wibbwobbler> that's interesting
[4:23:02] <Visorak6> But arent businesses considered people under citizens united
[4:23:09] <dinnydanny777> But at least you won't commit a felony if you're not in America LUL
[4:23:12] <%CzeekyPlays> AKA fuck america, I despise my country sometimes
[4:23:14] <LorcaNomad> copyright law is fucked
[4:23:17] <Mr_Strut> Just move the servers to moldova
[4:23:21] <%baka_sugoi> BS
[4:23:23] <%BoxNavy> lets make a canadian streaming platform :)
[4:23:25] <%Shady_Squid> copyright law is kinda fucked
[4:23:31] <%bread_assassin> Would a Canadian-based streaming service be immune to DMCA then?
[4:23:33] <%Hiro01231> How do we petition to move twitch out of america
[4:23:33] <NeroInfinite> I love my country but boy is the government fuucked.
[4:23:35] <%BoxNavy> :)
[4:23:35] <orcstr16> Interesting. I wonder if they'll try to turn you into a felon because of that.
[4:23:36] <Sotetsu> Quick Twitch, move to Canada
[4:23:39] <Mr_Strut> 2020 don't stop!
[4:23:39] <theanora1> can't wait for twitch dot co dot UK
[4:23:40] <%MaddyCaddy> Woo

[4:23:49] <Torgue_1> @Mr_Strut Wouldn't mean much if Twitch stays in the USA
[4:23:50] <%honeyman18> America causeing shit worldwide
[4:23:51] <NitronStreams> YEAH YAK
[4:23:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> yeyyeyeyeye
[4:23:54] <%LadyRarityV> Yyeyeyeyeye
[4:23:55] <%MaddyCaddy> So more Wasteland in the future?
[4:23:55] <%viciousgrim> Pat. you know most laws in the us are suggestions for companies in the us, and not the law LUL
[4:23:58] <%bevyrage> time to start looking into onlyfans pat. they support streaming and don't have this dmca bullshit
[4:23:59] <Doomstar16> Have a good night pat
[4:24:00] <%toastybites> Land of the free, home of the brave
[4:24:00] <%BoxNavy> D:
[4:24:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THANK YOU MONEY
[4:24:24] <%baka_sugoi> SOON
[4:24:25] <%LadyRarityV> true
[4:24:26] <@SoFarFetched> "eventually"
[4:24:26] <Visorak6> DMCA is inevitable
[4:24:35] <%QueequegTheater> If Twitch kills itself, it's over to YouTube streaming, right?
[4:24:36] <LorcaNomad> as is true of any monetary platform that is new
[4:24:41] <%maenos2> anyione that goes "such and such doesn't have this bullshit" is an idiot, because they fucking WILL when eeryone flocks to them.
[4:24:41] <NeroInfinite> Why does it feel like 1984 on twitch?
[4:24:47] <%OperatorJo_> if anyone looks t tech news, OH BOY IS NEXT YEAR GOING TO BE A RIOT
[4:24:51] <%Mrbaconator> yeah any website better than twitch will inevitablely become like this to some degree
[4:24:55] <Blank9> How about Deus Ex Mankind Divided?
[4:24:58] <%Reveresao> CKIII
[4:24:58] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Whatever happened to the Metal Gear stream?
[4:25:00] <%bigbrothergannon> i enjoyed the stream
[4:25:00] <%TheNewJapanGuy> More Yakuza
[4:25:01] <%maenos2> also remember how people were all "pornhub should take up the slack from youtube!" ? Because LOOK AT PORNHUB NOW
[4:25:03] <%BoxNavy> you never got to do pooh baseball jermaPluto
[4:25:08] <%the38bandit> how do you get in?
[4:25:11] <%Reveresao> Fair
[4:25:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> nuuuuuuu
[4:25:19] <@SoFarFetched> like Final Fantasy 7 OG Kappa
[4:25:20] <%MaddyCaddy> RIP Wasteland friends
[4:25:20] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Import Ishin
[4:25:28] <%wibbwobbler> back4blood looks rad
[4:25:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Wasteland isnt that long
[4:25:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Like 45-50 hours
[4:25:45] <Broken_Sonex> "It's hard, don't wanna"
[4:25:45] <Psyramics> the audience will not translate over entirely
[4:25:46] <%bevyrage> youtube is also worse than twitch already
[4:25:47] <%OperatorJo_> truth.
[4:25:50] <%Mrbaconator> also that too
[4:25:50] <%bevyrage> twitch is becoming youtube
[4:25:51] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Those platforms have their own issues
[4:25:53] <%BoxNavy> why would jimmy watch his own stream
[4:25:53] <+pectusumbra> I mean vtubers have helped shape that a bit towards youtube as well
[4:25:55] <%QueequegTheater> You lose a huge chunk of subscribers and have to start over, even on YouTube
[4:25:56] <orcstr16> That be true.
[4:25:58] <%Cozy90> DO BOTH
[4:26:01] <ShadeTheNovice> yeah youd lose alot by going somewhere else
[4:26:06] <%SirGO0SE> what about multistreaming, but telling your fans where you'll pay attention to chat? @PatStaresAt
[4:26:07] <dinnydanny777> YouTube is a cesspit LUL
[4:26:08] <Profmcstevie> Steam is where people buy games, twitch is where people watch games. Alternatives are always behind on features
[4:26:12] <NeroInfinite> @maenos2 Pornhub only did that because it was hard to find all the gross stuff on their site
[4:26:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YET
[4:26:35] <dinnydanny777> YouTube comments are the worst thing in the world though
[4:26:39] <%RealThiele> if that felony bs goes through a non-us streaming company might come up
[4:26:41] <+vaderxyz1970> Wouldn't it just take a couple of big streamers moving to a diffrent platform start a mass migration?
[4:27:02] <%BoxNavy> no
[4:27:06] <%bevyrage> @vaderxyz1970 you mean like ninja and a few others hitting up that one website?
[4:27:07] <Profmcstevie> Mass migration of fucking no one as a "couple of big streamers" went to Mixer
[4:27:07] <%baka_sugoi> nope
[4:27:09] <Blank9> absolutely not
[4:27:10] <@SoFarFetched> LUL Mixer
[4:27:11] <%AzureGale> Remember Ninja?
[4:27:14] <%baka_sugoi> mixer rip
[4:27:15] <+gitgouda> Yeah mixer failed pretty hard
[4:27:18] <dan_g_v> mixer, hee
[4:27:20] <%MaddyCaddy> But Ninja isn't entertaining üòè
[4:27:20] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Mixer lol
[4:27:23] <ShadeTheNovice> LUL
[4:27:23] <%Ranryu692> I was struggling to remember the name Mixer
[4:27:23] <%QueequegTheater> It would take literally every single streamer with over 500 viewers
[4:27:25] <+gitgouda> at least they managed to sell?
[4:27:25] <HeroToxiko> They gave all their money to TWO GUYS lmfao
[4:27:26] <%BoxNavy> unless EVERYONE up and leaves, no.
[4:27:27] <NeroInfinite> MIXERRR LUL
[4:27:27] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah and Ninja went from Mixer back to twitch with no problem
[4:27:27] <%OperatorJo_> tried that, did NOT work
[4:27:27] <%AzureGale> Shame about Mixer
[4:27:28] <Broken_Sonex> Who the fuck is Ninja?
[4:27:29] <%maenos2> some people really aren't thinking.
[4:27:35] <%baka_sugoi> the children love ninja
[4:27:41] <DrkJP520> Crinja
[4:27:41] <Profmcstevie> Uprooting and going somewhere else is difficult ALWAYS
[4:27:44] <NitronStreams> Man do you think Mixxer would be way more popluar rightnow? if they had lived long enough
[4:27:46] <%Mrbaconator> it's pretty good
[4:27:46] <%Cozy90> would would ninjas stream themselves?
[4:27:48] <$Afterman_> it was a mess, not anymore
[4:27:49] <%SirGO0SE> if someone wants to take down twitch they need something twitch doesn't have, would be hard to integrate, and cant quickly buy
[4:27:52] <%vaporousTippler> It turns into a kingdom management game in act 2. Other than that, great rpg.
[4:28:17] <%viciousgrim> hope everyone just plays indie games and stop playing game with copyrighted music and kills the music industry
[4:28:17] <%QueequegTheater> 2077 also runs better on Stadia, somehow
[4:28:20] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[4:28:23] <dan_g_v> what was that of cdpr doimg something for china?
[4:28:26] <orcstr16> Its fantastic, but you should REALLY look up build info ahead of time. It's pretty easy to fuck yourself even by crpg standards
[4:28:29] <HeroToxiko> im not wasting my ps4's eventual overheat on cyberpunk tbh
[4:28:34] <%MaddyCaddy> Cyberpunk's story disappointed me.
[4:28:57] <%BoxNavy> no :)
[4:29:08] <dan_g_v> stadia is the future of gaming
[4:29:08] <%MaddyCaddy> I pretty much 100% that game and did not come out happy
[4:29:09] <Blank9> that's on brand
[4:29:12] <%Aeoneth> Stadia playing the long game
[4:29:24] <HeroToxiko> @dan_g_v gog listed a game with skeletons and "Gamers" made then unlist it. Gamers meaning the leadership of mainland china
[4:29:26] <Profmcstevie> The best place to buy game about dystopia is magic box that says you own nothing. Beautiful
[4:29:53] <%OperatorJo_> I mean, it is
[4:29:56] <%baka_sugoi> FIRE BAD
[4:29:59] <%BoxNavy> ill try
[4:30:00] <%RealThiele> pain olympics has no winners
[4:30:00] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Wait using your spouse/BF's account is bannable?!
[4:30:02] <Leebrownie> but the burn is fast
[4:30:02] <DrkJP520> Burning is the worst
[4:30:02] <redrins> do both
[4:30:03] <%XeroSigmaPrime> fuck
[4:30:03] <LorcaNomad> Freezing to death also sucks tho
[4:30:03] <%bevyrage> the comparison here is that both are awful ends
[4:30:04] <%Aeoneth> Drown instead
[4:30:04] <%SirGO0SE> <3
[4:30:05] <Blank9> try not to drown
[4:30:06] <dan_g_v> nait
[4:30:07] <Leebrownie> freeze is slow
[4:30:08] <UlriktheSlayer1> bye
[4:30:09] <%wibbwobbler> BuddhaBar
[4:30:09] <dinnydanny777> Yeah but have you ever had cold ears though Kappa

[4:30:43] <dan_g_v> raid even
