[0:03:13] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Remember, the mission stories always put you right on the spot you need to be to complete the kill challenge related to it
[0:03:15] <Bigyanno> The mission story almost always ends before the kill
[0:03:15] <sabata63> CODE IN THE TUNNEL

[0:03:21] <%orcstr16> Unions have some downsides, but those downsides are so worth it to keep you from gettign fucked over.
[0:03:22] <Felto3> on the table in the tunnel

[0:03:42] <%orcstr16> See the game industry for an example of what no unionization leads to.
[0:03:44] <%G_Thunders> I know people hate on the Colorado map, but I feel like the daytime version of this map is the most boring one of all 3 games

[0:04:28] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> my fast forward is the pistol
[0:04:29] <%rytisone> @johnny_gogo they could easily make it a dlc on ps4, it's annoying
[0:04:30] <rcand9> i hope you enjoyed midgar because its back
[0:04:31] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> it'd be nice to like pass time until your target gets to the point they need to be
[0:04:32] <%Alazull> That'd be nice but broken
[0:04:35] <+CryptusMaximus> Is this an ad for that Capcom collection??
[0:04:37] <+zacyzacy> that would be pretty rad
[0:04:41] <+thecosmicfly> That was the noise of burger bing boot bettuce
[0:04:57] <%MrGuy516> its called watching the VOD.
[0:04:59] <%Alazull> They'd have to make npcs a little more random to balance out a fast forward

[0:17:24] <+CryptusMaximus> Nah, it's okay, but Sapienza is just amazing
[0:17:25] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> the sapienza author mission is pretty good
[0:17:25] <sabata63> Sapienza is the best in the entire franchise
[0:17:34] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> Colorado is my least favourite I think
[0:17:36] <%Ipsenscastle> Sapienza and Paris are outstanding, there's not many that compete
[0:17:36] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Most are good but some are bit less good
[0:17:41] <+CryptusMaximus> No?
[0:17:43] <BluBox> help. I can't stop laughing at the FF7 BR
[0:17:43] <%orcstr16> Nope, but don't worry the next one is pretty cool. Sapienza is the best for sure though.
[0:17:46] <%Mr_Pylon> I think the next level is good, and the last level is excellent
[0:17:48] <Meekest> The problem with this level is that it's huge but theres no reason to go anywhere except where the targets are
[0:17:48] <%orcstr16> Miami second best
[0:17:50] <+thecosmicfly> The Bonus Mission/night time version of this map is far better imo, makes more use of the center of the map
[0:17:51] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> if you choose that spot
[0:18:01] <%AzureGale> I think Sapienza just FEELS super expansive with multiple locations
[0:18:05] <CassyASG> the next map is great
[0:18:08] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt Yeah, Paris, Sapienza and Hokkaido are the definite highlights of the 2016 maps, though the nighttime remix of this location is pretty neat
[0:18:12] <+AlphaRayAllen> stinky
[0:18:15] <%AzureGale> Marrakesh just feels like there are fewer places to visit
[0:18:19] <+traximus_s> isn't there a revolution type of scenario
[0:18:19] <%aishman> Yeah the Hotel are fucking great.
[0:18:26] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> Hokkaido is real good
[0:18:27] <thelonechris> He's just gonna leave that food out there to get cold?
[0:18:27] <%aishman> I didn't like the Freedom Fighter one.
[0:18:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Hokkaido is great

[0:18:36] <%AJ_Cherenkov> AJ_Cherenkov subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Would you believe me if I told you Marrakesh and Colorado are widely considered low-points for the series?
[0:18:41] <+Redpointshine> I think the funniest thing is that 47 learned how to  cook Moroccan food  to blend in
[0:18:45] <+Javaa01> @aishman Oh trust me, no one likes Colorado
[0:18:59] <+CryptusMaximus> Chongqing in H3 is asbolutely stunning too
[0:19:03] <Felto3> colorado is the absolute worst map
[0:19:04] <%AJ_Cherenkov> @PatStaresAt the reboot trilogy, not the whole series that is
[0:19:05] <%AzureGale> @Redpointshine 47 can just do everything
[0:19:10] <%Mr_Pylon> Wait is that the same reporter from Paris?
[0:19:14] <+thecosmicfly> Colorado gets too much guff imo. Wouldn't want it 6x, but as a change of pace I thought it was great
[0:19:31] <+Javaa01> @CryptusMaximus Though Berlin might be the most fun mission in the entire trilogy just because of the gimmick
[0:19:35] <+CryptusMaximus> Yeah Pat we won't judge you if you just play Colorado only once LUL

[0:33:26] <dukenux> Silent Assassin's Creed

[0:34:14] <+Rekinsinn> you know what would be a cool cheat mode in this game? King Crimson mode
[0:34:17] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> he's a pro cameraman, he knows you're an imposter
[0:34:30] <dukenux> And you even wore a baseball hat to mask your perfectly bald head
[0:34:47] <%YourFavoriteShiba> is that snoring I hear?
[0:34:48] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> oh that's weird did that just skip dialogue
[0:35:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> I am very angery about the swedens

[0:35:09] <+boki_86> hi @PatStaresAt did you read Nomura: Since I'm involved with a lot of different projects, the next FF7R installment director will be Hamaguchi [...] I will be continuing with the FF7R series as Creative Director instead. Source: Famitsu
[0:35:12] <dukenux> I like how they made 47 more chatty  in this

[0:35:40] <+CryptusMaximus> 47 only speakis in dad jokes about assassination
[0:35:53] <yourliteraldog> sickophant
[0:35:54] <+boki_86> so Nomura is not the Director anymore
[0:35:54] <+MooseIsGoose> If so I think he will not like Colorado

[0:45:57] <dukenux> @CryptusMaximus actually, someone tried to find what's the barcode on 47s head in Absolution i think. and the search returned a dildo
[0:46:03] <+captain_thickthighs> seweden is too clean not enough work for janitor
[0:46:03] <Zebroneath> Alrighty.  Just odd to see, since PS4 allows about 10 or something.

[0:46:25] <dukenux> allegedly unintentional

[0:50:35] <penitentpendant> Standing there menacingly with a brick
[0:50:36] <+Nero_Cross> This is probably the weakest map of H1 imo
[0:50:49] <%Neryl_> Neryl_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[0:50:54] <Felto3> colorado is worse
[0:50:54] <+thecosmicfly> Wish there was more to the underpart of this level. Would've been cool if you could get to the escape tunnel through like the sewers or something
[0:50:55] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> toss a coin
[0:50:57] <%AyotoCorp> Throw a coin
[0:51:02] <CassyASG> you have to throw something
[0:51:04] <Garry_Guyface> Lure him with coins
[0:51:09] <Animal_Farm4> Acquire multiple bricks and knock everyone out before they have a chance to react
[0:51:13] <+wolfofsound> he really isn't worried about this white guy following him around with a brick
[0:51:13] <%AzureGale> WJTAS (Would Jesus Take A Shit)
[0:51:17] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[0:51:19] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> poggers hitman!
[0:51:22] <Mahbonk> greedy asshole
[0:51:23] <dukenux> Coin keep
[0:51:26] <+Shady_Zaku> toss a coooin to npcs
[0:51:30] <+CryptusMaximus> @Nero_Cross Have you even played Colorado? Far weaker.
[0:51:30] <sabata63> Poison the free samples
[0:51:32] <thelonechris> This is kind of like the New Orleans mission from Blood Money, where you had to dispatch 3 guys in the middle of hundreds of NPC's
[0:51:38] <%ambig_anti> LUL
[0:51:42] <%AzureGale> SO CLOSE
[0:51:47] <%AyotoCorp> How did that almost work
[0:51:51] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> if you waited 2 seconds
[0:51:51] <+Javaa01> You have an autosave closer to where you botched it
[0:51:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> nearly had him
[0:51:53] <%notsoy> coin him into the side that time
[0:51:56] <+thecosmicfly> Good thing there aren't any witchers about
[0:52:11] <+MooseIsGoose> Throw a coin to distract the guard
[0:52:19] <Hillthugsta> many of those npcs are fake
[0:52:34] <+CryptusMaximus> Throw an item into that area
[0:52:36] <Hillthugsta> in blood mooney
[0:52:38] <+EMFole> EMFole subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! just got my wisdom teeth out thank for stream
[0:52:42] <thedoodynator3000> drop the coin
[0:52:46] <dukenux> that guy's asleep
[0:52:47] <Animal_Farm4> Did his head just have god ray reflections for a second? LUL
[0:53:08] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt Maybe save now
[0:53:13] <ToneBacas> that's how shiny his bald head is
[0:53:15] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> save
[0:53:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> 47 is VERY bald
[0:53:21] <Basic_Birch_> Just kill them all pat Kappa
[0:53:32] <dukenux> LUL
[0:53:34] <%IDTheftVictim> I actually did this mission fairly recently, don't think I could get him to get a coin. always someone farther away
[0:53:36] <dukenux> at last
[0:53:37] <+thecosmicfly> To horny jail with him
[0:53:37] <scrimscromble> bonk
[0:53:40] <+WingBuffet> that dude dead as hell
[0:53:40] <penitentpendant> SAVE
[0:53:44] <%AzureGale> GOTEM
[0:53:44] <CappuccinoGuil> But Pat, can't you see? You have a good eye for high quality pottery.
[0:53:47] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> That's why you're the best, boss
[0:53:52] <thelonechris> This game requires a ton of waiting
[0:53:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its so easy tho
[0:54:01] <rcand9> this missions not the best
[0:54:03] <dukenux> Reminds me of the Old Hitmen
[0:54:09] <dukenux> before the Blood Money hitmen
[0:54:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> I just made this joke on someone elses hitman stream the other day but it'd be hilarious if 47's head had the super detailed reflections on it
[0:54:18] <$Mekhet09> Why does everyone sound american?
[0:54:19] <trickquestionz> Is Agent 47 just Pat if he was tall, inexplicably nondistinct and capable of murdering hundreds of people?
[0:54:23] <Felto3> and thats not the worst disguise to get
[0:54:31] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> if only there was a way to pull people aside at any time
[0:54:33] <%MrGuy516> Wait till gets to Colorado...
[0:54:34] <+Partialrecall2> does this game force you into a firefight for a final boss or can u baby stealth the whole thing?
[0:54:39] <%AzureGale> This feels like they mashed two separate maps into one
[0:54:39] <penitentpendant> "Ignore my lighter skin color"
[0:54:40] <ToneBacas> woudda fool me
[0:54:51] <%AyotoCorp> Hitman works on Superman glasses rules
[0:54:52] <+Redpointshine> "Hey man your skin got a couple of shades paler? are you feeling alright?"
[0:54:56] <Slimeking_Mike> More Walking
[0:54:56] <%IDTheftVictim> now for fun walkies
[0:54:58] <+thecosmicfly> @Partialrecall2 never forced into a boss fight
[0:55:00] <Mahbonk> There can be only one
[0:55:00] <%AzureGale> @Partialrecall2 You can totally stealth through the whole game if you want to
[0:55:06] <Hillthugsta> Colorado was bullshit
[0:55:10] <%코코꾸라> SourPls
[0:55:10] <TSBasilisk> @Partialrecall2 Can't speak for 1, but the last mission of 3 is essentially a corridor shooter
[0:55:10] <+Partialrecall2> nice ty
[0:55:11] <%G_Thunders> @partialrecall2 Hitman’s whole thing is making deaths look like accidents
[0:55:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPla
[0:55:20] <+tetraes> ah jeez i hate the psod
[0:55:28] <+CryptusMaximus> Sorry guys the revitoligo hit me real bad
[0:55:33] <Animal_Farm4> I actually liked Colorado a lot more because it really feels like you're inching through all the layers of security of the camp
[0:55:34] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> you should see the place with hitman 3's lighting
[0:55:35] <%rytisone> it's lit
[0:55:36] <ExpressNode> That is nice looking
[0:55:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> Hey wanna lamp tho?
[0:55:46] <+wolfofsound> @rytisone get out
[0:55:47] <%baka_sugoi> an LSD trip for sure
[0:55:55] <CassyASG> colrado was not bullshit it was fun
[0:55:55] <+Partialrecall2> @G_Thunders not the old ones, one slip and its a full on shooter
[0:56:03] <+thecosmicfly> @Animal_Farm4 Someone gets it quiettNoice
[0:56:11] <Zebroneath> I'd like to see that room in the updated Hitman 3 look
[0:56:14] <+MooseIsGoose> @Animal_Farm4 That was my fav mission as well I just think Pat will not like it
[0:56:20] <Zebroneath> (when it's fixed)
[0:56:21] <%aishman> Colorado was bad
[0:56:23] <sabata63> use this time to memorize the layout
[0:56:24] <ExpressNode> Also some really weird news but apparently on twitter there's gonna be something called "Super Follows"
[0:56:24] <+Troispoint> Underwhelming level tbh
[0:56:26] <%G_Thunders> @partialrecall2 oh I misunderstood what you meant then. It’s the same deal here
[0:56:29] <Giztech> make me want to sing a dwarf chant
[0:56:30] <%aishman> Too open, too many targets, just eeh
[0:56:38] <scrimscromble> sapenzia best map
[0:56:39] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @PatStaresAt do you have any intention of playing blood money on stream?
[0:56:43] <%lumporr> this has the vibe of an AC tailing mission
[0:56:57] <+Javaa01> @aishman And just enforcers out the ass unless you have one of the unique outfits
[0:56:59] <Animal_Farm4> Final level I feel is kind of unfortunately designed that it becomes MUCH more interesting on subsequent runs when you get more interesting start positions
[0:57:01] <%rytisone> what about Absolution? Kappa
[0:57:03] <rcand9> remember the temple missions in silent assasin? much better mission
[0:57:06] <+CryptusMaximus> Hitman requires a tad bit of patience LUL
[0:57:07] <%G_Thunders> There’s like 15 more maps after this one that are all better
[0:57:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> Wait is the Hitman 3 porting thing still not fixed? I thought they just updated it?
[0:57:17] <Hillthugsta> Colorado is bullshit Suit only...sniper as well
[0:57:21] <%AzureGale> Colorado's issue is that you have to be in a disguise almost the entire time or else everyone will cap your bald ass
[0:57:23] <%AtlasMcCoy> BACK OFF PAL
[0:57:24] <%MrGuy516> This trilogy has a bunch of levels that are just remakes of blood money levels anyways.
[0:57:31] <%gitgouda> gitgouda subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:57:46] <%Broken_Sonex> Gonna print my dick a thousand times and make a slide show of it all.
[0:57:50] <Mahbonk> you're part of the gang
[0:57:51] <Zebroneath> Paris and Sapienza are incredibly strong, but this and especially Colorado are weak
[0:57:52] <dukenux> @rcand9 but then it's followed by the hospital mission
[0:58:05] <%AzureGale> Also four targets is a bit much
[0:58:07] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I'm gonna head to bed. Have a good rest of your stream, guys.
[0:58:07] <%aishman> TURN OFF THE PRINTER
[0:58:12] <%aishman> Paaat
[0:58:18] <+CryptusMaximus> I simp Diana
[0:58:20] <%AyotoCorp> This kill is great
[0:58:20] <%aishman> Here we gooo
[0:58:29] <%aishman> When there's no one around, turn off the printer.
[0:58:38] <duckmeister7> colorado being bad is a meme, bangkok is the worst level in the entire trilogy
[0:58:45] <+thecosmicfly> @PocketBearIllustrator sleep well
[0:58:46] <+Partialrecall2> woolieF woolieU
[0:58:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> Ahh Reza Zeydan, the man with a posh English accent
[0:58:50] <Hillthugsta> Japan was pretty fun
[0:58:53] <+CryptusMaximus> Yeah give it a bit of time
[0:58:57] <CassyASG> colorado is better than this map and is not that bad geez
[0:59:03] <+traximus_s> did he save
[0:59:08] <penitentpendant> Save first?
[0:59:10] <Animal_Farm4> Stop the presses
[0:59:15] <Felto3> this extremely safe printer
[0:59:24] <yourliteraldog> smoke break
[0:59:35] <ashuckel> save
[0:59:36] <%aishman> You may have to subdue that guy
[0:59:47] <+wolfofsound> who could have done this?! :O
[1:00:00] <Hillthugsta> i thought bangkok was fun
[1:00:02] <sabata63> don't stand near your distranction
[1:00:09] <%Broken_Sonex> But....how.....who could've....?
[1:00:13] <sabata63> YES
[1:00:14] <+Javaa01> Literally left of the printer
[1:00:15] <%AyotoCorp> You looked everywhere but the box
[1:00:15] <+CryptusMaximus> Feel free to stuff some of those guys into boxes
[1:00:18] <+Javaa01> Not 5 meters away
[1:00:18] <yourliteraldog> toy tank
[1:00:18] <Animal_Farm4> You looked literally everywhere but where you could hide a person LUL
[1:00:20] <sabata63> THERE IS
[1:00:21] <rcand9> @dukenux i almost forgot about terminal hospitality
[1:00:30] <+wolfofsound> any box can fit a body if you're desperate enough
[1:00:33] <ActingKing42> there's a giant press?
[1:00:33] <%Mr_Pylon> 47 could retire from hitmanning and become an excellent health and safety advisor for OSHA
[1:00:42] <%aishman> And now you wait
[1:00:47] <+scratchmesilly> yall getting mad about him fucking up like this game isnt made to fuck up in lmao
[1:00:51] <yourliteraldog> live in box
[1:01:11] <+CryptusMaximus> Printman
[1:01:14] <%MrGuy516> become as box
[1:01:16] <%Ranryu692> @Mr_Pylon it's not like they couldn't use the help
[1:01:19] <penitentpendant> Just sittin' on that unconscious man
[1:01:22] <%n0tanaxemurderer> I feel safe. in the box
[1:01:24] <CassyASG> i wonder if he'll play the DLC for hitman 1
[1:01:25] <+thecosmicfly> @scratchmesilly No shut up every playthrough must be perfect
[1:01:33] <+scratchmesilly> return to BOXE
[1:01:43] <Hillthugsta> hide in box like bigboss
[1:01:48] <+Javaa01> @Mr_Pylon You joke but you literally act out a meeting as a safety advisor in one of the illusive targets, telling them how they could die in an accident
[1:02:07] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> BLOOD FOR THE PRINTING GOD
[1:02:16] <scrimscromble> owch
[1:02:17] <+wolfofsound> To shreds you say?
[1:02:21] <+scratchmesilly> LMAO
[1:02:22] <yourliteraldog> Those jibs
[1:02:22] <Djinnazz> Shouldn't have looked.
[1:02:22] <CassyASG> lol
[1:02:23] <theshillman> RED INK
[1:02:24] <%AzureGale> YEYEYEYE
[1:02:25] <penitentpendant> So gotta take care of the other printboy first
[1:02:26] <Manwad> Fatality
[1:02:29] <%aishman> Don't you mean to load the 2nd one?
[1:02:30] <+CryptusMaximus> "It needed some flesh toner"
[1:02:33] <yourliteraldog> Ps2 jibs
[1:02:35] <%Mr_Pylon> @Javaa01 that rules
[1:02:36] <Basic_Birch_> Must have been the wind
[1:02:38] <RevolverOcelot16> LUL
[1:02:40] <+thecosmicfly> @wolfofsound but how is his wife handling it?
[1:02:44] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Switch Outfits
[1:02:45] <+scratchmesilly> SLEEP NOW
[1:02:57] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> he was a ghost
[1:03:01] <+wolfofsound> @thecosmicfly to shreds you say?
[1:03:04] <dukenux> OH NO HE SLIPPED
[1:03:05] <Animal_Farm4> If you still have a brick on you you can chuck brick to knock the guy out as he shows up and immediately shove Rieza in
[1:03:05] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> it was a ghost all along
[1:03:39] <+thecosmicfly> The version of this hit in Santa Fortuna is also very strong
[1:03:42] <+wolfofsound> @thecosmicfly glad somebody got the reference LUL
[1:03:45] <+thecosmicfly> Blood cocaine for everyone
[1:04:01] <%aishman> It's cause he walks by I think
[1:04:10] <%IDTheftVictim> apparently general guy is voiced by Lucious Malfoy, so that's neat
[1:04:13] <+thecosmicfly> Who doesn't love pre-cancelled Futurama? :)
[1:04:21] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> he returned from the aether
[1:04:38] <+wolfofsound> hey now post cancelled had some good episodes sprinkled in there LUL
[1:04:39] <%MelBrooksKA> Pat, you being blind is the least stangest thing ever
[1:04:48] <penitentpendant> Slow on the drag
[1:04:49] <CassyASG> just go
[1:04:50] <%aishman> BODY FOUND
[1:04:51] <+MooseIsGoose> You hesitated
[1:04:52] <penitentpendant> Just a hair
[1:04:55] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> aqlmost
[1:04:59] <%orcstr16> @thecosmicfly Even post cancelled futurama had some bangers in it.
[1:05:00] <%jarednotwithsubway> jarednotwithsubway subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Holy shit congratulations to the both of yall! i was absolutely bawling watching that segment of the podcast, just really amazing and genuine. you give hope to us all <3 you ginger goblins are the fuckin best
[1:05:07] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @IDTheftVictim isn't it funny how if you just add an s to lucius malfoy it gets a whole other meaning?
[1:05:23] <rcand9> do you do suit only runs off stream pat?
[1:05:24] <+thecosmicfly> @wolfofsound that I agree with also, but usually isn't most folks cup of tea
[1:05:27] <Hillthugsta> is Miami good?
[1:05:37] <penitentpendant> Hitting him with the door
[1:05:47] <Animal_Farm4> throw brick and push in
[1:05:50] <+thecosmicfly> Miami is great
[1:05:53] <CassyASG> throw something the other way
[1:06:04] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> master the toss and takedown
[1:06:08] <duckmeister7> and that's why you're our greatest asset 47
[1:06:10] <+wolfofsound> @thecosmicfly I think it's because the first two back had some rough episodes where OG futurama was just all gold
[1:06:14] <%aishman> It's fine if you don't get SA dude
[1:06:15] <rcand9> the big push
[1:06:17] <Zebroneath> this seems badly timed
[1:06:18] <waywardhavoc> i think there's a button on it to clear it for another body
[1:06:22] <+MooseIsGoose> lol perfect camera angle no idea why he did not go into the room
[1:06:23] <%notsoy> just put him in the dumpster too
[1:06:24] <+superkeaton> Do it perfecter
[1:06:26] <+CryptusMaximus> You could just knock that one guy out and wait another cycle LUL
[1:06:27] <%notsoy> dumpsters can hold two
[1:06:40] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> chat what's the story behind this mission?
[1:06:41] <duckmeister7> you're supposed to take out all of the other printers first
[1:06:57] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> beautiful
[1:06:59] <penitentpendant> Perfect
[1:07:01] <duckmeister7> NAILED IT
[1:07:01] <Meekest> Did you just snap his neck?
[1:07:04] <%IDTheftVictim> This time tomorrow General Safe, you'll be all over the news
[1:07:04] <penitentpendant> SAVE
[1:07:06] <rcand9> yeeyeyeye

[1:07:15] <+CryptusMaximus> Yeah optimally you wanna clear the printer guys FIRST
[1:07:17] <%Pookiedaexzile> CAn you Imagine how easy murder would be with a 3rd Person Camera
[1:07:19] <rcand9> nice work patty7
[1:07:19] <%AzureGale> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[1:07:20] <%bhp_99> SAVE
[1:07:20] <scrimscromble> stop the presses
[1:07:22] <penitentpendant> "Red ink refilled"
[1:07:31] <duckmeister7> yeah that's realistic actually
[1:07:32] <+Skelegroove> Machine still working too
[1:07:33] <CassyASG> he threw himself in thre what a shame
[1:07:36] <%MisterRockett> He got turned into flyers.
[1:07:37] <TSBasilisk> That is one durable machine to still be going
[1:07:40] <+CryptusMaximus> He's a propaganda poster now
[1:07:41] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> it didn't even print a poster of him smh
[1:07:43] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> oh yeah the machine ate him
[1:07:50] <thelonechris> The general leaned in too close and got sucked in and squished
[1:07:58] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt Have you seen one of those printing factory accidents where people just get sucked in, cause yeah, paper thin is more then descriptive
[1:08:00] <+thecosmicfly> Completely Judge Doom'd
[1:08:04] <waywardhavoc> he was just trying to help on the press
[1:08:05] <Ashrox117> He gumby now
[1:08:13] <dinnydanny777> Zero evidence limesYay
[1:08:21] <dukenux> he became his own propaganda. it's like poetry
[1:08:24] <%aishman> You've always killed the general dude last
[1:08:30] <darklurker_dumahiem> DOUBLE QUARTER POUNDER
[1:08:42] <%Mr_Pylon> Obra Dinn this shit
[1:08:43] <Mahbonk> LUL
[1:08:46] <Hillthugsta> the 50cal kill in this map is my favorite
[1:08:47] <rcand9> TOTAL ACCIDENTS
[1:08:50] <%aishman> Sounds like something from Obra Dinn
[1:08:50] <scrimscromble> v bad luck
[1:09:00] <CassyASG> imagine death by stuffed moose
[1:09:00] <+Partialrecall2> tenno six?
[1:09:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SEEMS LEGIT
[1:09:01] <Zebroneath> IMPOSSIBLE
[1:09:01] <rcand9> Dont worry about it boss
[1:09:02] <thelonechris> And several people woke up naked in boxes
[1:09:04] <+MooseIsGoose> And it was all SILENT
[1:09:05] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> what an incredible accident how could this have happened
[1:09:06] <%AJ_Cherenkov> wild coincedence
[1:09:08] <TSBasilisk> And during that time, a dozen people spontaneously fell unconscious, got stripped naked, and ended up in chests
[1:09:09] <%rytisone> what a day
[1:09:10] <+thecosmicfly> If the Bonus Missions and Elusive Targets are canon, Sapienza is the murder capital of the world
[1:09:11] <ExpressNode> What a freaky coincidence
[1:09:12] <rcand9> these guys are cursed
[1:09:12] <waywardhavoc> did anyone notice a skin head running around while this was happening
[1:09:13] <Mahbonk> what has the world come to ? All those terrible accidents
[1:09:15] <%augusta_wind> @aishman lmaooooo
[1:09:16] <%IDTheftVictim> was also filmed
[1:09:19] <penitentpendant> Reminds me of an anime where a guy "Died by suicide" by using glass pipes to paint the entire room red while chainsawing his own head off.
[1:09:21] <Mahbonk> has god forsaken us ?
[1:09:26] <+MisterAvry> plausable deniability
[1:09:28] <tanarath> It's just how life works sometimes, Pat.
[1:09:33] <+MooseIsGoose> Totally silent
[1:09:35] <penitentpendant> *red with his blood
[1:09:37] <rcand9> i get it
[1:09:39] <yourliteraldog> Thats an invader zim refrence
[1:09:41] <%G_Thunders> There’s news reports on the TV that actually bring that stuff up, but pass it off as conspiracy theories
[1:09:45] <yourliteraldog> Moose Room
[1:09:57] <+MooseIsGoose> Do you ever go back through the levels and only use the sniper to kill the targets.
[1:10:00] <dukenux> "Also some people got knocked out, and undressed. Probably unrelated" @PatStaresAt
[1:10:03] <+thecosmicfly> Vomit vial
[1:10:04] <%Puhff> ROOM W MOOSE
[1:10:04] <thelonechris> Puke juice
[1:10:11] <Zebroneath> Nice
[1:10:14] <+Javaa01> Now you can make people shit themselves all around the world
[1:10:14] <rcand9> thats gor really quick speed runs
[1:10:16] <TSBasilisk> Skipped right over the explosive ducky

[1:10:48] <Zebroneath> It is not DLC, it's the next story mission
[1:10:56] <%IDTheftVictim> Fun fact, Jordan Cross is voiced by Lucio

[1:11:40] <darklurker_dumahiem> DOUBLE QUARTER POUNDER
[1:11:41] <+thecosmicfly> Ken THE BRICK Morgan
[1:11:43] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> Ken "THE BRICK" Morgan
[1:11:46] <dukenux> YEEA, you get to kill Jared Leto!
[1:11:47] <TSBasilisk> So we are murdering the first guy on the suspicion that he murdered a girl
[1:11:48] <%Pookiedaexzile> "Daddy I wanna be a rock star"
[1:11:49] <+CryptusMaximus> "Stop the Snyder Cut from happening 47"
[1:11:50] <+Partialrecall2> he killed somebody and made it look like an accident? nothing worse that that.
[1:11:53] <NenaFan101> Hey, he looks like you!
[1:11:55] <+thecosmicfly> @A_Mighty_Walrus eyyyyyy
[1:11:56] <scrimscromble> you can kill this guy super easy
[1:11:59] <%IDTheftVictim> Ok so cops in this universe just default to deaths being accidents
[1:12:02] <Zebroneath> horrible musician and a corrupt lawyer
[1:12:03] <dinnydanny777> A fixer upper
[1:12:04] <+MisterAvry> fuck yeah
[1:12:04] <%Pookiedaexzile> "Sure Son, Commit a Murder while you;'re at it"
[1:12:08] <%Mr_Pylon> it implies so mucjh
[1:12:09] <rcand9> yeah
[1:12:11] <+MisterAvry> it's just as good as "wheelman"
[1:12:11] <%AzureGale> I prefer the term closer
[1:12:12] <yourliteraldog> He fixes problems
[1:12:18] <+wolfofsound> yo i'll solve it
[1:12:23] <ToneBacas> yeah but what kind of problem? my TV won't turn on?
[1:12:25] <+Redpointshine> so is ICA good alligned? or does 47 murder good people too.
[1:12:26] <thelonechris> The Equalizer
[1:12:27] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> cleaner is better
[1:12:27] <+Soliloquy123> It's like 'cleaner'
[1:12:29] <rcand9> like the wolf from pulp fiction
[1:12:31] <NenaFan101> Did anyone ever watch the movie "The Mechanic"?
[1:12:31] <%bhp_99> I really like the premise of this mission, just plain revenge not any over-arching plot
[1:12:32] <+Soliloquy123> "Oh what do you clean" "Problems"
[1:12:35] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> It's so vague it can ONLY be nefarious.
[1:12:38] <+thecosmicfly> Can you put "Fixer" on a P41?
[1:12:39] <Manwad> library of ruina does great work with that term
[1:12:39] <NenaFan101> The old one, with Charles Bronson?
[1:12:41] <+CryptusMaximus> Obligatory Hitman Hotel level that every game must have
[1:12:42] <%Pookiedaexzile> I would love to have the Title of Fixer, and just a shitty Percentage of actually fixing things
[1:12:43] <%AzureGale> ICA is supposed to be neutral
[1:12:43] <ape_hawk> other end, pat
[1:12:45] <ToneBacas> @Redpointshine ICA is chaotic neutral
[1:12:45] <Hillthugsta> @redpointshine ...yes.
[1:12:47] <ExpressNode> The handyman... of murder
[1:12:52] <%MisterRockett> Fun fact about this mission! These two marks aren't supposed to be able to meet. But testers cheesed it with coins, so they put in a secret where if they meet they argue, then go up to a private room to argue again, where he will then throw the lawyer off the building in the same way he did his girlfriend and set himself up for you to push HIM off.
[1:12:53] <TSBasilisk> I hear 47 Paints Houses
[1:12:59] <%Mr_Pylon> poisons a good smuggled item
[1:13:06] <darklurker_dumahiem> DOUBLE QUARTER POUNDER
[1:13:16] <trickquestionz> @Redpointshine The ICA operates on such a high level of geopolitics that everyone 47 is sent to murder is a wealthy scumbag. Like he's too expensive to hire to murder anyone else.
[1:13:20] <CassyASG> like flloyld meaweathers daugther stabbing pregnant ppl but she running around free
[1:13:23] <%IDTheftVictim> I feel like lockpick is busted compared to other options
[1:13:24] <CappuccinoGuil> hahahahahahahaha..... she said Welcome
[1:13:26] <%Ranryu692> ICA carries out extra-judicial killings. They're not good guys, even if they only kill bad guys lol
[1:13:27] <+MooseIsGoose> @MisterRockett holy crap I never even tried that
[1:13:38] <rcand9> @MisterRockett nice

[1:14:02] <+thecosmicfly> Honestly, as far as hotel levels go, this was kind of a bummer. Felt like it should've had more hotel rooms and POI's, like a pool or something

[1:16:07] <lets_be_friendos> the digital deluxe edition of intergrade is $144.95 here in Australia HOORAY FeelsAmazingMan FeelsBadMan
[1:16:08] <battlexqueen> i think this is the one i had the hardest time with

[1:16:41] <Zebroneath> sweater around the neck in 80+ degree weather
[1:16:44] <%TDotGoat> TDotGoat subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Congrats on the engagedement, Pat + Paige!
[1:16:46] <+thecosmicfly> Who needs a sweater in this heat
[1:16:47] <battlexqueen> ask the nice man at the desk
[1:16:48] <+CryptusMaximus> There's a bellhop that escorts you at the desk
[1:16:50] <sabata63> there WAS a guy to follow
[1:16:50] <Animal_Farm4> Did you even check in at the front desk properly?
[1:16:55] <+MooseIsGoose> It is on floor 3 I think
[1:16:55] <hairtoday> can you check in at the desk?
[1:16:58] <scrimscromble> you dont even need your neck warmed rn
[1:16:58] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> what, you think sweater over the shoulders means you're a back dorothy?
[1:17:02] <sabata63> You ignored him
[1:17:04] <CassyASG> @wolfofsound thats sad but that was an accident  Mayweather's daugther stabbed a pregnant girl over a rapper
[1:17:07] <+CryptusMaximus> Yeah but he probably left already
[1:17:15] <Zebroneath> too late for the bellhop
[1:17:17] <%Mr_Pylon> you ran away from bellhop
[1:17:18] <NenaFan101> Are you supposed to tip them?
[1:17:24] <%MisterRockett> @ansterdamn It sounds like they have their own grinder. I BELIEVE they use a French press for the actual brewing, which is popular and what I got set up. You can also do a pour over if you feel like you'll only ever make one cup.
[1:17:28] <NenaFan101> "Curse you, papparazo!"
[1:17:30] <$RealThiele> @CassyASG holy shit

[1:19:04] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> it's a little gay, Pat. You probably like to look at balls.
[1:19:05] <Emelyns> purple is dope
[1:19:06] <Vakojin> "Guess I'll like red cause I'm a ginger"

[1:26:32] <%Pookiedaexzile> Does it have "real" peanut butter in it?
[1:26:34] <ExpressNode> That could have been the excellent 47 joke
[1:26:36] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> @AzureGale I can still hear him say WE'RE TREMENDOUSLY BUSY HERE because of the escalation mission
[1:26:39] <CappuccinoGuil> Vegan cake is actually a thing and doable

[1:27:05] <%Broken_Sonex> @SaltyAzteca WELL JUST LOOK AT HIM.
[1:27:05] <NenaFan101> I assume coconut fat instead of eggs and carob instead of chocolate, right?
[1:27:06] <CappuccinoGuil> Saw this video of a cool ass grandma making a gluten free vegan cake, she was rad
[1:27:14] <%Broken_Sonex> THAT'S LITTLE V

[1:27:35] <SaltyAzteca> STOP. BEFORE YOU DOOM US ALL
[1:27:39] <+wolfofsound> and apple sauce
[1:27:42] <yourliteraldog> I've had vegan cake before it's actually not bad. They sell a thing called egg replacer it dose what says on the tin.
[1:27:42] <dukenux> Atleast ONE of these guys must be a Little V stand in
[1:27:43] <dumahiem> as you will so far fetched however over the years of these streams plenty of people have said objectionable things what I've said is neither negative incendiary perhaps slightly rude in the form of being annoying however I guess you don't like to off beef patties on a sesame seed bun with your choice of toppings so I'll shut up and I'm sure at some point some will say something actually nasty
[1:27:45] <+Plus_On_Black> Give him a horrible death, Pat. Kill him good.
[1:27:46] <%bassoontyphoon> I feel like having lasers outline a cameras FOV is a huge security risk

[1:28:17] <%GarbageNirvana> Vegan food can be baller
[1:28:19] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> man it's so weird seeing this without the reflections
[1:28:22] <+Alopekis> @mayor_manders I like it because whether it's in pounds or kilos, it shows that 47 is incredibly light. lol
[1:28:24] <%GarbageNirvana> Just gotta play to its strengths
[1:28:27] <skyentombment> I figure he's been at it for like 20 mins, with the people-thankin

[1:30:32] <+thecosmicfly> Now to put them in the -0 degree ice box where they surely will not freeze to death
[1:30:32] <%Hiro01231> Those people are dead
[1:30:34] <TSBasilisk> So you just murdered them
[1:30:34] <TakingLifesL> @ToneBacas in stead of bezos bucks

[1:31:33] <scrimscromble> inconspicuous
[1:31:36] <2017y> decorate the birlthday cake
[1:31:41] <skyentombment> @marumiyan1 they're not paid enough to care

[1:32:39] <%shurtal> "Do you do poison?" "No sir, this is a library."
[1:32:40] <SaltyAzteca> The insecticide maybe?
[1:32:40] <dukenux> Skull and bones is a pretty rockin cake topper
[1:32:40] <%walternatorz> "Where am I going to get poison this time of day?"
[1:32:44] <+CryptusMaximus> Do it without poison, trust me, you get something unique
[1:32:46] <+Javaa01> You don't need poison, it just helps simplify the kill
[1:32:46] <%Monkeyweed21> there are other ways
[1:32:46] <scrimscromble> forgot the poiiison
[1:32:49] <yourliteraldog> always bring poisin pat
[1:32:50] <+MooseIsGoose> It should be fine
[1:32:54] <dumahiem> in fact I encourage you to permanently block and or mute me so I can only watch an abject silence
[1:32:58] <+zepelinnn1> did Pat see the 'chair' kill in this stage yet?
[1:33:00] <TSBasilisk> Think poison is complicated to make each mission
[1:33:03] <Meekest> Is he???
[1:33:08] <%Pookiedaexzile> No
[1:33:09] <+MisterAvry> har har har
[1:33:13] <%AzureGale> Just be patient
[1:33:15] <%Pookiedaexzile> You didn't do the poision
[1:33:15] <+Javaa01> @zepelinnn1 Nah, he hasn't done that yet
[1:33:18] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[1:33:19] <dukenux> the cake... is COCONUT
[1:33:20] <+Partialrecall2> they used to call me Cake Topped back in the army
[1:33:25] <LVL1_Scumbag> Yes. The surprise of a delicious cake.
[1:33:34] <cosmicdischarge> did you see the new shit for Destiny 2 ?
[1:33:34] <+zepelinnn1> @zepelinnn1 cool, thats a very good one imo
[1:33:35] <%aishman> Sorry I missed it, did Pat poison the cake?
[1:33:37] <%Broken_Sonex> Happy Birth Day Little V
[1:33:41] <I_OneGuy_Over_Heaven_I> poison tho

[1:33:48] <2017y> bonne fete bonne fete
[1:33:54] <+thecosmicfly> @aishman nope
[1:33:55] <%lumporr> i wanna hear those dulcet tones
[1:33:56] <TSBasilisk> @aishman Nope, had the option but no poison
[1:34:01] <+thecosmicfly> Gonna just see what happens
[1:34:05] <%aishman> Oh damn
[1:34:13] <%AzureGale> Time 4 maximum awkward
[1:34:15] <%aishman> There is a lethal poison in this map though
[1:34:15] <%Pookiedaexzile> No he didn't poison the food on his kill mission
[1:34:20] <%Monkeyweed21> its a vegan cake its already poison
[1:34:21] <%aishman> You have to get the key card around the laundry
[1:34:24] <+thecosmicfly> Honestly the kill without the poison is better
[1:34:26] <+Partialrecall2> i hope you get some cake, it would suck to kill a guy on his birthday and not even get to eat his cake
[1:34:27] <+Javaa01> Oh no not a vegan cake, those are the worst types of cake
[1:34:34] <ToneBacas> social distancing buddy
[1:34:35] <SaltyAzteca> Remember that one time 47 square danced in Mississippi?
[1:34:38] <TomFrancis_> Dunk his face in the cake lol

[1:40:44] <s1rcuit> fibrer wire and then place him in the cake
[1:40:48] <%Monkeyweed21> he has extra dialogue
[1:40:49] <%bassoontyphoon> makes sense
[1:40:49] <%aishman> Double fiber all the way
[1:40:54] <+scratchmesilly> thats some liquid asss cake man
[1:40:55] <scrimscromble> it was an accident, cake death effects one in a thousand people every year
[1:41:03] <+CryptusMaximus> YEAH NOW TAKE HIS CAKE
[1:41:07] <karl_rex> That cake is an ugly color
[1:41:09] <%lumporr> cake-based homicide
[1:41:09] <%luketrapwalker> makes sense
[1:41:17] <TSBasilisk> And then dragged his own corpse into a nearby chest
[1:41:17] <yourliteraldog> Just like a birthday at my abuelo's house
[1:41:18] <%Monkeyweed21> GOOD OL CHOKEJERK
[1:41:19] <ToneBacas> auto-erotic asphyxiation gone wrong
[1:41:19] <Jonny_Uppercut> He strangled himself and them himself into a crate by accident
[1:41:19] <%lumporr> it's vegan-colored
[1:41:19] <dukenux> Cake or Death? I choose BOTH
[1:41:21] <+thecosmicfly> I love that people in the World of Assassination™ can't hold their breath for more than 4-7 seconds
[1:41:25] <+Partialrecall2> fiberwire doesnt work in real life because it'll just cut through like cheese and spray everywhere
[1:41:26] <%Hiro01231> And then hid his body in that case
[1:41:27] <Tuna_Can_0> the choke jerk claims another victim
[1:41:28] <s1rcuit> he compressed a bunch of cotton candy and then ate it
[1:41:28] <%Teintstein> oh no not a david carradine
[1:41:28] <TrollKing96> He's probably the only 27 Club member to be assasinated.
[1:41:35] <%lumporr> fuck this sucks
[1:41:39] <dukenux> "I am the cook :) "
[1:41:43] <%luketrapwalker> There has to be a German word for "death by cake"
[1:41:45] <+Javaa01> @scrimscromble Well, at least it's not a gender reveal party, I think those have a way higher mortality rate
[1:41:46] <dukenux> booo
[1:41:47] <+hibiki847> just got in how much hitman have i missed
[1:41:50] <scrimscromble> he would be the kind of guy to die by chokejerk
[1:42:01] <Tuna_Can_0> Just kitchen staff here :)
[1:42:11] <yourliteraldog> Some dude blew him self up at a fender revel party
[1:42:20] <+thecosmicfly> @luketrapwalker totenkucken
[1:42:22] <%lumporr> uh god
[1:42:25] <Zebroneath> @hibiki847 You missed Marrakesh being finished.  He's starting Bagkok
[1:42:26] <%Ipsenscastle> I feel like Hitman takes place in the John Wick universe
[1:42:27] <Jonny_Uppercut> Pardon me, I'm kitchen staff
[1:42:32] <dukenux> "-Hi Chef. -Hey kids"

[1:42:47] <%templar010> It is I, KITCHEN STAFFMAN
[1:42:55] <%Pookiedaexzile> So you're not going for a full Whoops Run
[1:42:58] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Just for reference, around there is a laundry zone where the Master Keycard is at
[1:42:59] <+Alopekis> Has he gotten that one kill yet? I don't want to spoil it so hopefully someone has some idea what I'm talking about.

[1:43:48] <%lumporr> "i know how you fucking love it 47, you slut"
[1:43:48] <%Teintstein> @SomeAsianDood right? it'd be such a pain having your method of death overshadow basically everything else you've done
[1:43:51] <CassyASG> you can kill with cocunuts btw
[1:43:55] <%AzureGale> Knock out boxers guy and take his disguise
[1:43:55] <+thecosmicfly> The loo

[1:44:32] <s1rcuit> did he just get up through the bench?
[1:44:33] <yourliteraldog> Let's hit the showers bois
[1:44:34] <+Alopekis> @evbites Alright, cool. I like that kill. Wish there was more like it. lol

[1:52:21] <Zebroneath> I don't think there are elevators in any of the games.

[1:53:12] <Tuna_Can_0> They hoist you up through the window

[1:53:29] <%DianaTheAscian> yes
[1:53:30] <+CryptusMaximus> I actually suspect the lack of elevators has something to do with the engine. They probably couldn't get them to work properly.
