[0:23:29] <summonerron> physics look a lot like the phone game sky
[0:23:31] <Sprawler14> is the flare also a metaphor?
[0:23:37] <%krispen_wa> isnt every artsy game about depression?
[0:23:44] <LunarRemix> Probably parents induced depression
[0:23:49] <MrDoomtastic44> kinda
[0:23:54] <%Burdenslo> I wish the flair gun made a Rick flair WOOO everytime you shot it
[0:23:56] <+mel0dica> if it were that easy...

[0:26:06] <%Nested_Dreams> Pat is clearly in recording mode, hot takes later
[0:26:27] <Sprawler14> is twitter just a journal that everyone can read
[0:26:31] <%Lion_kun> This seems like a much less good Rime
[0:26:35] <%krispen_wa> Have you seen my daughter? her name is cheryl. my name is harry mason. I'm in town on vacation.
[0:26:45] <summonerron> twitter is for brain farts

[0:32:27] <deviljhojho_> the bird represents freedom. or somethin. i dunno
[0:32:35] <masandyballs> I can see them!!
[0:32:35] <%brickwall35> perspective
[0:32:37] <+Kenzo2000> What if we made a game about depression?
[0:32:38] <deviljhojho_> its S Y M B O L I C
[0:32:45] <+krispen_wa> The boat symbolizes a vehicle you use to get through water
[0:32:50] <Ball_Bag_Goblin> Pack your bags kids
[0:32:52] <GammaRayGarrett> It'll be really funny if this game is not a metaphor at the end and all of this is extremely literal
[0:32:53] <Ball_Bag_Goblin> Time for a road trip
[0:32:58] <iceballstwitch> only 400 miles away
[0:33:02] <deviljhojho_> A metaphore about depression? in my indie game? i wonder
[0:33:06] <DaKnightWarrior> @themanilamile the journey of life?
[0:33:10] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:33:11] <deviljhojho_> why did i write metaphore hmmm
[0:33:19] <+Gamblitz> take the choo choo!
[0:33:23] <%KineticZen> No no, this is a German game, the Germans don't do metaphors
[0:33:25] <TheManilaMile> @DaKnightWarrior Maybe?
[0:33:26] <Yummy_Nukes> but what does it mean????
[0:33:27] <%goose_attack_almanac> She's not practicing proper boat safety
[0:33:29] <%goose_attack_almanac> Get her a vest
[0:33:33] <%krispen_wa> depression simulators and pixel art throwback games maake me hate indie developers
[0:33:34] <%BoxNavy> stop bumbing bro
[0:33:35] <Sprawler14> the metaphor is a semaphore
[0:33:55] <deviljhojho_> Germany is a metaphor really. Dunno about what
[0:34:02] <deviljhojho_> PENIS ROW
[0:34:04] <%Chichen> same
[0:34:05] <%UvBenServed> Same
[0:34:05] <0monkeyking> LUL
[0:34:06] <%KineticZen> The shape doesn't help
[0:34:06] <LunarRemix> This kind of sea-town would be perfect for a Souls-like game, very pretty but melancholic
[0:34:07] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[0:34:07] <NitronStreams> i did too
[0:34:07] <iosephe> whoa
[0:34:08] <$Dakuu75> wishful thinking
[0:34:09] <worldbrand> It is slightly phallic
[0:34:12] <Sprawler14> THAt is intentional it MUST be
[0:34:13] <%SveriSageAdvice> i looked over and legit saw it too
[0:34:13] <olaksi> depends on what the metaphor is
[0:34:13] <%mike2hands> same
[0:34:15] <TheManilaMile> What does the penis sign symbolise?
[0:34:17] <%Necnill> Powerful Freudian metaphor
[0:34:17] <%brickwall35> PENIS ON
[0:34:20] <Yummy_Nukes> it looks like a penis too
[0:34:21] <%BoxNavy> PENIS
[0:34:24] <LeeOhX> I thought the same thing
[0:34:25] <%BoxNavy> PENIS ON
[0:34:26] <DaKnightWarrior> nice TPFufun
[0:34:27] <@Moobot> Check out Sea of Solitude here! https://bit.ly/3r5tkX3
[0:34:40] <%JumboCrunchies> Is this Agoraphobia?
[0:34:41] <%BoxNavy> the sign looks like a penis too
[0:34:42] <+Gamblitz> Mermaid dark souls when?
[0:34:42] <NitronStreams> Thats actually some really cool tech
[0:34:44] <%BigDumBeak> thats an impressive tech :O
[0:34:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> When someone says that depression is all in your head, remind them that every feeling is all in your head, and we can't magically control those ones either.
[0:34:54] <Arancet> this game would be WAAAAY better if they just cut out all dialogue that ive seen so far
[0:35:04] <%krispen_wa> Get a game over
[0:35:06] <LeeOhX> So the boat is safety?
[0:35:09] <%krispen_wa> i wanna see
[0:35:16] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:35:22] <deviljhojho_> Oh fuck
[0:35:22] <GammaRayGarrett> @Arancet yeah it feels a bit early for this kind of dialogue, it just kinda gives it away
[0:35:22] <revoltingimp> welp, that's mad threatening
[0:35:29] <%BoxNavy> now you will be the dumbfuck
[0:35:29] <deviljhojho_> that gave me conniptions
[0:35:49] <%krispen_wa> BIRB
[0:35:51] <NeroInfinite> Is that a c'thulu
[0:35:56] <olaksi> dad???
[0:35:58] <%valriot> BIRD UP
[0:36:02] <CoffeeSlice> what
[0:36:04] <deviljhojho_> the giant bird is a metaphor for her father
[0:36:05] <+Gamblitz> @krispen_wa that'll be a failure of the game designer my man
[0:36:07] <DaKnightWarrior> Hunt that monster lytUSEGUN
[0:36:10] <%krispen_wa> Yeah the dialogue just...doesnt add anything
[0:36:11] <Sprawler14> the bird is a metaphor
[0:36:17] <%BoxNavy> jermaPain
[0:36:20] <+Oricalcon_Arts> thats a negatory ghost rider
[0:36:29] <iosephe> The hurt giant bird is a metaphor for you
[0:36:29] <%KineticZen> This feels like a Narbacular Drop sort of project for this team
[0:36:29] <%Nested_Dreams> Bets on bird-dad
[0:36:32] <%Arancet> @Arancet its so blatant from moment one its makes you roll your eyes because youre not invested at all yet
[0:36:45] <+Oricalcon_Arts> im no expert in bird law but...
[0:36:51] <+UnabashedGarbage> Wow, mad deja vu all of a sudden
[0:37:01] <%BoxNavy> SICK
[0:37:07] <SteamShow> How are ya, Pat?
[0:37:11] <%krispen_wa> do you think they have a bird In-N-Out somewhere?
[0:37:26] <LunarRemix> I guess it's not linear?
[0:37:38] <+tweedler92> Yeah there was a bunch of em back there
[0:37:38] <LeeOhX> fastest gamer alive
[0:37:38] <deviljhojho_> ah big brain
[0:37:39] <DaKnightWarrior> Pro gamer moves Kappa
[0:37:42] <%Nested_Dreams> I mean, this was the nice title that stayed in brain after E3 yet its name got replaced with Spritfarer
[0:37:43] <%krispen_wa> it has chapters so it is linear
[0:37:45] <%ConLin_Arts_> the game is like 4h long according to HLTB
[0:37:49] <+Kenzo2000> @krispen_wa yeah, but the line wraps around ti the bird wendy's
[0:38:12] <Yummy_Nukes> man, good thing there seems to be no fall damage
[0:38:17] <+Kenzo2000> heh
[0:38:21] <dereksbales> !Sos

[0:38:29] <deviljhojho_> PENIW NOW
[0:38:31] <%BoxNavy> penis...
[0:38:32] <+inkandamber> Just read a description about this game. It absolutely sounds like a student brief that just got turned into an actual product.
[0:38:33] <iosephe> The penis sign is a metaphor for a penis
[0:38:43] <deviljhojho_> very freudian
[0:38:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> @inkandamber It really do feel that way
[0:39:00] <%Broand> The boat is a metaphor for your happy place
[0:39:03] <%KineticZen> That sign can't be unintnetional
[0:39:04] <NitronStreams> Chillin with the boys in water world
[0:39:17] <%BoxNavy> its friendly now :)
[0:39:24] <%krispen_wa> Is this Shadow of the Colossus?
[0:39:26] <NitronStreams> supposes
[0:39:28] <+Vancoolness> what?
[0:39:33] <deviljhojho_> perhaps
[0:39:37] <iosephe> please part the ocean
[0:39:37] <deviljhojho_> use your bayblade
[0:39:39] <%BoxNavy> Moses
[0:39:40] <iosephe> sick
[0:39:41] <deviljhojho_> hold up
[0:39:46] <olaksi> oh, it's moses
[0:39:47] <%Lion_kun> The symbolism here is so painfully obvious and then I think back to Rime where you have to think about what it all means.
[0:39:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> and then he parted the ocean
[0:39:50] <$Dakuu75> eat shit moses
[0:39:52] <%ConLin_Arts_> Noses

[0:48:01] <%BoxNavy> kids are naturally born evil its true
[0:48:06] <Profmcstevie> On the one hand, don't punch children. On the other hand, getting punched in the face once in your life does wonders
[0:48:07] <Goodvibes99508> or weight at least
[0:48:09] <DaKnightWarrior> The bully in my school got rushes by the whole class on the last day LUL

[0:49:43] <dereksbales> would you say cursed?
[0:49:44] <deviljhojho_> its HARDCORE BULLYING
[0:49:46] <ToneBacas> school bullies are the ultimate enemy
[0:49:46] <NeroInfinite> I wish I had long beautiful hair. D:
[0:49:47] <Profmcstevie> They punched our eyesight blue

[0:49:56] <LeeOhX> god I'd kill every bully i've ever had
[0:49:58] <%Valdorick> 1 - fuck the kids, 2 - fuck the adults who are suppose to be watching the kids
[0:50:04] <@SoFarFetched> D:
[0:50:04] <Shining_Armor> I left, have we gotten to the part about lesbians and or sexual identity yet?
[0:50:04] <deviljhojho_> Fuck
[0:50:08] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[0:50:08] <LunarRemix> That felt cheaop
[0:50:08] <%BoxNavy> Jebaited
[0:50:09] <+captain_thickthighs> punch kids for a better future
[0:50:13] <Shining_Armor> Not a spoiler btw I'm guessing
[0:50:14] <jamsbybetty> rock those tiny nerds
[0:50:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> @Shining_Armor What the what?1
[0:50:17] <DaKnightWarrior> you only get one Pat.
[0:50:20] <Sprawler14> its called retribution
[0:50:20] <triggersqueeze1985> I hate gimmicks in general
[0:50:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> I would punch every kid and punch myself twice
[0:50:21] <$Dakuu75> LOL
[0:50:22] <%BoxNavy> its ok to bully kids
[0:50:24] <deviljhojho_> maybe not their level but surely their height
[0:50:25] <%krispen_wa> LUL LUL LUL
[0:50:26] <dereksbales> wont take much to be the same level
[0:50:28] <+oktavia_von> like you said everyone gets one
[0:50:29] <%BoxNavy> as an adult
[0:50:30] <%honeyman18> they all grew up to do meth or storm a capitol here, no loss
[0:50:30] <jamsbybetty> bullying evil children is a fun and legal thrill
[0:50:32] <%Valdorick> Bully time
[0:50:33] <%crabmeat495> Stoop below their level for a swift uppercut
[0:50:33] <Rojahh> technically a higher level
[0:50:33] <%KeiganOfAstora> This is one of those "Senua: Hell's Blade" type games....
[0:50:33] <Tracazoid> Well you will be at their level height wise, so it's all good
[0:50:34] <@SoFarFetched> Hire Pat to beat up the neighborhood bullies for you.
[0:50:34] <deviljhojho_> oh fuck
[0:50:35] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> More like what if the kids are GUILTY
[0:50:35] <+Gamblitz> remember! bullies are single thinking animals  that only go one direction
[0:50:36] <%Necnill> monkaS
[0:50:39] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:50:39] <Profmcstevie> I can rise above their level, I can walk down to their level punch em in the face and then come back up
[0:50:40] <%Rumbutt> Every time traveler gets ONE
[0:50:42] <Shining_Armor> @KeiganOfAstora I'm guessing. Usually artsy games have themes of depression or sexuality.
[0:50:47] <+captain_thickthighs> if you punch 100 bullies that just leaves 1. the math works out
[0:50:48] <%Broken_Sonex> You’re the Punisher @patstaresat
[0:50:48] <deviljhojho_> THE LIGHT, THE PROMISE OF SAFETY
[0:50:48] <%UvBenServed> YEEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:50:49] <%coward_man> just keep swinging on them kids until you knuckles are cracked and bloody
[0:50:51] <$Dakuu75> YEAH, SHANG TSUNG THEM
[0:50:51] <+Plus_On_Black> I agree with all that
[0:50:52] <triggersqueeze1985> Stop bleeding child
[0:50:52] <%mike2hands> you'll transform those kids in to  supervillians
[0:50:53] <%BoxNavy> KILL
[0:50:56] <deviljhojho_> The light is a metaphor for punching kids in the face

[0:51:21] <Mirrorcatch> yeah murder!
[0:51:27] <%Fooguwu> this is a trans thing isnt it
[0:51:28] <deviljhojho_> piss your pants maybe?
[0:51:33] <@SoFarFetched> D: oh no
[0:51:33] <%spitelite> man this game is so subtle
[0:51:37] <skyentombment> mate?
[0:51:37] <revoltingimp> this is some f-tier bullying script
[0:51:39] <+Gamblitz> its not a lake...
[0:51:42] <$Hommando> Fairy is ancient
[0:51:43] <LunarRemix> Are they british/australian?
[0:51:44] <Shining_Armor> "Don't be such a fairy" Called it
[0:51:44] <Tracazoid> "Quick let's chase her into the light shadow brethren, nothing can go wrong."
[0:51:44] <mar_krow> Just store all your negative thoughts
[0:51:48] <%walternatorz> Yeahhh, they'd use other choice language
[0:51:49] <LeeOhX> F A I R Y
[0:51:52] <+krispen_wa> What could this BE ABOUT?
[0:51:54] <+captain_thickthighs> I would say give the kid a gun but....
[0:51:55] <%coward_man> yeah that's like 50's
[0:51:57] <deviljhojho_> this is the 80s PogChamp
[0:51:57] <%YabbaTroll> I have literally only heard it in kung fu hustle
[0:52:00] <skyentombment> OR very british
[0:52:00] <$Dakuu75> yeah, that's some 80's shit
[0:52:00] <%BoxNavy> they use a different f word
[0:52:02] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I've heard people call themselves fairies.
[0:52:03] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Fairy is so fuckin old, even in the UK
[0:52:05] <dresdengh0st> PG 13 version of the F slur
[0:52:09] <Profmcstevie> Not since teen movies of the 90s TRYING to be the 50s
[0:52:09] <%Rumbutt> Fear the old slurs
[0:52:12] <revoltingimp> oh ones, the f word
[0:52:15] <triggersqueeze1985> Stand by me villain
[0:52:17] <deviljhojho_> the other other f word
[0:52:19] <Saltmeisterr> german
[0:52:25] <Saltmeisterr> they are german
[0:52:26] <mar_krow> Not an American thing I think
[0:52:28] <+captain_thickthighs> @dresdengh0st the f swear?
[0:52:29] <+MediocreHermits> i feel like you or paige would have said that to clemps
[0:52:39] <%coward_man> even in europe slurs are pretty hardcore
[0:52:39] <%Rumbutt> This is so fucking real
[0:52:40] <+Gamblitz> they should just call you a bundle of sticks
[0:52:40] <olaksi> furry?
[0:52:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> So we are playing as femboi nikkib12Pog nikkib12Smug sweetc2Excited
[0:52:46] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I get what theyre getting at but man, this doesnt even scrape close to what actual bullies could say
[0:52:47] <LeeOhX> who are these demon kids jesus christ
[0:52:51] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Because you know the kids are GUILTY Pat
[0:52:52] <%Movemeister> Yes, the game
[0:52:52] <@SoFarFetched> The developers  of this game are based in Berlin,Germany.
[0:52:53] <dereksbales> back when fairys still existed
[0:52:56] <vVAstrAVv> why are there no adults in this school
[0:52:57] <%KineticZen> Tank n spank
[0:53:00] <%Burdenslo> Weird place like Europe? Alright bagged milk land
[0:53:02] <LeeOhX> Are kids ever like this bad?
[0:53:08] <%krispen_wa> Bruh what kind of shithole schools did some of these people go to
[0:53:08] <%coward_man> it's the feeling of "OH I remember feeling this"
[0:53:10] <vVAstrAVv> to punch these kids
[0:53:11] <LunarRemix> Games can never replicate bullying
[0:53:12] <jamsbybetty> luigis mansion x alan wake x death stranding
[0:53:13] <triggersqueeze1985> The devs are from Down under
[0:53:13] <revoltingimp> this is what us europeans think americans are like
[0:53:13] <%ClericOfSparda> I remember watching an episode of "The Brady Bunch" and one of the boys was being called A Canary because he liked to sing. Never heard that before as an insult.
[0:53:18] <dereksbales> kids are worse
[0:53:24] <%supergoblinpunch> No way, Fairy is a boomer word even in Eu
[0:53:27] <LunarRemix> And if you could, no one would ever play it
[0:53:28] <%Necnill> Time to go to a miku concert
[0:53:31] <%walternatorz> going to the rave
[0:53:33] <+Gamblitz> green means go
[0:53:35] <Joakim_Stormchaser> i thought sea of solitude was a pirate game
[0:53:48] <%BoxNavy> thats sea of thieves
[0:53:49] <+captain_thickthighs> dude I remember kids calling out their teachers looks for the reason why they got divorced for a younger woman.
[0:54:04] <%walternatorz> I'd like to go back on the boat, please.
[0:54:06] <%Movemeister> When I first saw Pat was playing this I thought it as that Cthulu game
[0:54:13] <%krispen_wa> what the fuck kind of school has THIS many bullies
[0:54:16] <%YabbaTroll> jesus
[0:54:19] <%brickwall35> LUL
[0:54:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> CHRIST
[0:54:22] <+inkandamber> QUANTIC DREAM ARE PUBLISHING THE DIRECTORS CUT

[0:54:24] <LVL1_Scumbag> dam
[0:54:24] <%krispen_wa> OOF
[0:54:28] <Profmcstevie> Aim for the throat
[0:54:29] <+inkandamber> EMOTIONS ARE REAL
[0:54:31] <$RealThiele> holy sheeeet
[0:54:33] <@SoFarFetched> This feels like a small school.
[0:54:35] <LunarRemix> Wow that must've hurt
[0:54:35] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[0:54:36] <@SoFarFetched> if its a lot of kids.
[0:54:37] <%goatbait> Kids are awful
[0:54:39] <LeeOhX> jesus
[0:54:40] <deviljhojho_> kids are fucked up man
[0:54:40] <%BoxNavy> kids are cruel ja-- pat.
[0:54:40] <+Double_Tap_That> Kids have no sympathy.  They will kill you if given the chance.
[0:54:42] <$tehbeardedbard> i hard one kid to another " hahahaha your moms dead "
[0:54:45] <+captain_thickthighs> it was art class year two
[0:54:48] <Profmcstevie> NEVER expose your weakpoint to children
[0:54:52] <%coward_man> in one of my schools people made jokes about the teacher with cancer who died later that year
[0:54:55] <LeeOhX> that one calls for physical retaliation
[0:54:56] <%spitelite> kids are the worst
[0:54:58] <dereksbales> i told my teacher she need invitro cuz her pussy was dust
[0:54:59] <Tuna_Can_0> who listens to kids DansGame
[0:54:59] <Yummy_Nukes> children are the real monsters!
[0:55:02] <%Daxalog> No limiter
[0:55:02] <+Delenay> this kind of bullying in the game feels very tv showy. doesnt feel natural
[0:55:03] <%Infernal_Dalek> Kids are cruel, Jack, and I'm in touch with my inner-child
[0:55:03] <+oktavia_von> @captain_thickthighs how am i just finding about that
[0:55:06] <%goatbait> Kids don't know what a mental filter is
[0:55:10] <ToneBacas> they were hollows?
[0:55:12] <deviljhojho_> humanity restored
[0:55:13] <Tracazoid> Yeah that sounds like my grade school as well
[0:55:14] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> They were completely hollowed out
[0:55:15] <$RealThiele> doubt
[0:55:16] <%supergoblinpunch> same
[0:55:16] <%mike2hands> SHIT DADS
[0:55:17] <Profmcstevie> I will teach empathy through violence, good goddamn
[0:55:17] <iosephe> Kids are fucked up
[0:55:20] <Tuna_Can_0> I don't believe anyone that don't pay taxes
[0:55:21] <%SomersaultJustice> holloe
[0:55:22] <cherrycottontail> kids aren't humans
[0:55:24] <jumpyhugs> oh there was a reason
[0:55:27] <KaiserMario> Lemme guess... Mostly white school?
[0:55:28] <%daniphofani> are these the same kids from the "every teacher gets one" bit
[0:55:28] <worldbrand> kids are sociopaths because they find it funny because they're too insecure to attempt anything remotely resembling being genuine
[0:55:28] <%Broken_Sonex> KIDS ARE CRULE JACK
[0:55:29] <%coward_man> oh many of those kids don't get humanity again, they end up on drugs and in prison
[0:55:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> This is why every teacher should indeed get one, until it is done
[0:55:32] <@Moobot> Check out Sea of Solitude here! https://bit.ly/3r5tkX3
[0:55:34] <$RealThiele> unlike now
[0:55:35] <dereksbales> when your bullied you bully back
[0:55:37] <LeeOhX> yeah and some kids are just nice so fuck the mean ones
[0:55:38] <RAH001> In high school some savages made a new young teacher cry
[0:55:38] <+BubbaRands> Sympathy and Empathy is learned and not innate
[0:55:39] <Tuna_Can_0> little shits don't even have a job
[0:55:41] <sendart> people in one of my classes would draw twinkies on the board (teacher was on the heavier side)
[0:55:42] <%Daxalog> Some kids arent taught to just not be cruel to people that arent their parents
[0:55:44] <+captain_thickthighs> @oktavia_von I told you the day it happened I was in that class. it was the our teacher with the freckles she found out that day her husband was leaving her. and is one kid just loaded that bullet and shot it and she cried and left the room.
[0:55:51] <vVAstrAVv> pat you punched a kid cus YOU colored wrong
[0:55:55] <Sprawler14> the bird is a metaphor for the little brother, i see
[0:55:55] <jumpyhugs> the reason was like of time-punches
[0:55:57] <triggersqueeze1985> One of my teachers locked himself in class and shot out the window
[0:55:57] <%coward_man> oh the big crow is her brother
[0:56:09] <NeroInfinite> I too was a shit head kid, but I did assert mt dominace in the pecking order of things fairly quickly.
[0:56:18] <deviljhojho_> oh so the crow was a metaphor for her brother not her father
[0:56:18] <dereksbales> azuzu!
[0:56:22] <+Gamblitz> damn game, I'll give you this, you affected me.
[0:56:25] <$Dakuu75> this world confuses me, so.
[0:56:28] <Yummy_Nukes> most kids are psychopaths until like 18 or 20, something to do with the brain
[0:56:31] <skyentombment> Is it gonna be something like stopping a school shooting? at this point I wouldn't be too surprised
[0:56:34] <NeroInfinite> Ther eis not LUL
[0:56:34] <%krispen_wa> LUL
[0:56:35] <@SoFarFetched> no,achievements only geefPoint
[0:56:37] <deviljhojho_> no you will GET the cheevos
[0:56:40] <+captain_thickthighs> these achievements are ruining my depression
[0:56:42] <Saltmeisterr> LUL
[0:56:43] <cherrycottontail> If you get super bullied you turn into a hype ass bird monster? Soundslike a good deal to me
[0:56:43] <LunarRemix> Yeah it's a little too often
[0:56:45] <olaksi> sponsored part over?
[0:56:46] <deviljhojho_> MORE CHEEVOS
[0:56:47] <Shining_Armor> Children have to be taught empathy, it's not something you naturally learn at that age. It requires active parenting
[0:56:47] <%BoxNavy> its so immersion breaking good god
[0:56:47] <deviljhojho_> MORE

[0:59:19] <CoffeeSlice> was this developed by quantic dreams
[0:59:20] <%coward_man> is this game just sofarfetched adventures?
[0:59:23] <+oktavia_von> @captain_thickthighs remember the dummy ostracized a bird in school

[0:59:30] <+BubbaRands> so close
[0:59:31] <TurtlesAndTentacles> is that a fucking monster whale? I fear regular whales as is
[0:59:36] <dresdengh0st> @Tuna_Can_0 I have to tell everyone, its the only way to stop those monsters!
[0:59:41] <Shining_Armor> @krispen_wa RWBY has the writing and naming capacity of a shonen manga written by a boy who just discovered violence.
[0:59:47] <deviljhojho_> looks like some sort of giant seal woman
[0:59:51] <iosephe> Pat is a metaphor for blind
[0:59:52] <BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:59:54] <deviljhojho_> Nani
[0:59:54] <%krispen_wa> Is the monster a representation of gacha whaling?
[0:59:59] <+captain_thickthighs> @oktavia_von it's burned in my brain. that guy got arrested for possession like 7 years ago
[1:00:03] <+Kenzo2000> did you actually have gills though?
[1:00:06] <deviljhojho_> i want it all to be literal
[1:00:09] <%BoxNavy> literalnesses....
[1:00:10] <deviljhojho_> that would be the best
[1:00:11] <revoltingimp> well good thing they fixed that for you

[1:00:21] <olaksi> absolutely
[1:00:22] <iosephe> the tightropes aren't well indicated though
[1:00:27] <deviljhojho_> agreed tomatoPog
[1:00:27] <$RealThiele> its not about slavery, they are androids
[1:00:29] <$Dakuu75> FATALITY
[1:00:30] <triggersqueeze1985> Little mermaid?
[1:00:30] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[1:00:30] <WarchiefGoldva> The kids at my school weren't shitty to our teachers for no reason. I remember this alcoholic, chainsmoker math teacher that hated her job and hates kids to the point where when she got KO'ed by an accidental stray soccer ball, everyone cheered because we wouldn't get classes that day.
[1:00:31] <iosephe> Yes
[1:00:32] <Tuna_Can_0> @dresdengh0st the kids? or people who jump to conclusions? atpRtsd
[1:00:39] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> The kids were trying to bully a literal Crow Kaiju
[1:00:40] <Sprawler14> what happened to sunshine happy raincoat girl?
[1:00:40] <DaKnightWarrior> Yeah, that would be cool.
[1:00:42] <worldbrand> we could use more horror games that aren't metaphorical
[1:00:45] <%SomersaultJustice> what if it's a metaphor for something mundane, like buying pants
[1:00:45] <Sprawler14> where'd she go?
[1:00:48] <%anticrust> Unfortunately it is a metaphor
[1:00:48] <olaksi> lmao
[1:00:48] <deviljhojho_> OH NO NO
[1:00:49] <%asgard147> Purgatory maybe?
[1:00:51] <worldbrand> allegorical horror sure but less metaphorical
[1:00:53] <Saltmeisterr> c h o m p
[1:00:59] <$DeeJayOkay> who's ready for ANOTHER MONCH
[1:01:01] <dereksbales> fish lay eggs, so do birds... think about it
[1:01:04] <olaksi> a lotta failure of game design right here
[1:01:06] <+captain_thickthighs> the metaphor is kinda heavy handed it could make you work to figure it out
[1:01:14] <Profmcstevie> Are you asking artys fartys bullying story to be a little bit more interesting than metaphorical? How dare you
[1:01:17] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I can't wait to see this on YouTube cause I missed alot
[1:01:18] <iosephe> The bestworst thing this game could be a metaphor for is being a furry and/or nerd
[1:01:25] <DaKnightWarrior> Darn midgar zolom.
[1:01:27] <@SoFarFetched> The Sea Monster is giving me vibes of Bette Midler's Stand, High Priestess.
[1:01:28] <%coward_man> the true horror is children
[1:01:32] <Tuna_Can_0> I'll still never listen to kids, they don't pay taxes and don't even have to get a job DansGame
[1:01:41] <@SoFarFetched> just cause water and hairy monster thing geefThink
[1:01:43] <olaksi> I mean doesn't it kind of stop being a metaphor if it's basically spelled out
[1:01:46] <%Broken_Sonex> Bullying the Kaiju bird huh? @patstaresat
[1:01:48] <Shining_Armor> "You are a furry. There is no metaphor." would be fun to see at the end.

[1:09:52] <%coward_man> okay so did the kid kill himself in the lake or did the bullies drown him?
[1:09:57] <WarchiefGoldva> He doesn't shower so his stank kills you if you touch water, no wonder people bully him.

[1:12:14] <CoffeeSlice> ah, its a metaphor for Venice and climate change
[1:12:17] <@SoFarFetched> the games pretty short,so depending how well they wrap it in the few hours.
[1:12:23] <%krispen_wa> Man, this game is wasted on this symbolism
[1:12:27] <triggersqueeze1985> Is this Iraq?
[1:12:37] <Shining_Armor> Most symbolic games are
[1:12:50] <+krispen_wa> its so pretty for something so vapid
[1:12:59] <+Kenzo2000> @krispen_wa I would love to play this game if it was just a game
[1:13:03] <%BoxNavy> the bully railroad
[1:13:04] <+tigerfang86> "ITS JUST A PRANK BRO"
[1:13:06] <LeeOhX> People wanna tell their stories

[1:13:46] <Shining_Armor> They are PUNCHING a ball of light
[1:13:48] <deviljhojho_> RELATABLE CONTENT
[1:14:03] <+tigerfang86> Dodgeball is a literal deathsport
[1:14:08] <deviljhojho_> dodgeballs rules as long as you are doing the hitting
[1:14:11] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I tell ya what, I could dodge some balls back in the day
[1:14:11] <%coward_man> dodgeball doesn't rule when 1 team is you alone
[1:14:13] <Profmcstevie> Dodgeball with foam balls rules
[1:14:18] <deviljhojho_> getting hit in the balls is not so disco tho
[1:14:19] <+BubbaRands> In Dodgeball everyone is equal
[1:14:22] <amiavamp> I was a nerd in school and still think dodgeball rules
[1:14:24] <mar_krow> Shadow the colossus the bird
[1:14:25] <%GeneralSCPatton> I could not throw for shit, but I was an evasion tank with psaBig aggro power
[1:14:26] <leinadtonu> hitting children rules
[1:14:28] <%vaporousTippler> Foam? Give me that rubber. Make it sting.
[1:14:35] <leinadtonu> *with balls
[1:14:36] <+Gamblitz> damn ape children
[1:14:36] <%brickwall35> the bad at dodgeball should read the good at dodgeball
[1:14:41] <triggersqueeze1985> Does your milkshake bring all the boys to the yard tho?
[1:14:43] <mar_krow> And dodgeball is worst
[1:14:44] <WarchiefGoldva> Remember when a gaggle of kids surrounded you and started punching and kicking your screaming corpse while the teachers took pictures?
[1:14:44] <LeeOhX> Dodgeball is a sport invent to see who was being bullied prove me wrong
[1:14:44] <%coward_man> no they're attacking the light
[1:14:52] <%Divryne> I hate video games.

[1:22:54] <%lumporr> @coward_man like i vividly remember screaming "i hate you" at my dad but hearing some shitty vo hamming it up kinda doesn't do justice to the feelings of that moment
[1:22:55] <%MisterRockett> Quick! Before you have to see your brother's dick!
[1:22:56] <+tigerfang86> naaaaah
[1:22:58] <JustYudha> I never understood pantsing...
[1:22:59] <triggersqueeze1985> Defeat the magical space neuron
[1:23:01] <verscoll> :(
[1:23:02] <%JumboCrunchies> No this is exactly where bullying ends up.
[1:23:03] <%Necnill> Yeah
[1:23:04] <%Rumbutt> This is exactly what bullying is like
[1:23:05] <+UnabashedGarbage> Unfortunately, yes...
[1:23:06] <iosephe> ladder
[1:23:07] <baka_sugoi> BibleThump
[1:23:07] <%lumporr> yeah you never had the shadow men come after you on the basketball court
[1:23:11] <Ipsenscastle> sounds like you weren't bulled properly
[1:23:12] <Shining_Armor> The authority in that "Pants him" is neon levels of voice acting
[1:23:12] <%BoxNavy> i never got it this bad but no its not
[1:23:16] <%JohnAtDawn> I never understood pantsing or anything like that.
[1:23:17] <worldbrand> my bullies never glowed red but that's about the only difference
[1:23:23] <NeroInfinite> Pantsing is just to humiliate you.
[1:23:26] <Torgue_1> True
[1:23:27] <+Shacklebox> This is average to extreme bullying
[1:23:27] <LeeOhX> anyone who's had crazy levels of bullying knows this is what its like
[1:23:28] <dereksbales> i do it all the time with my dad. show your a man
[1:23:29] <%coward_man> this is not even the worst bullying you could get
[1:23:30] <@SoFarFetched> yeah its huge humility.
[1:23:31] <DaKnightWarrior> OH NotLikeThis
[1:23:31] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This is bullying's natural conclusion. You gotta kick their asses before it gets that extreme
[1:23:32] <%curiour> it's about making you feel mental pain, no other reasonings
[1:23:32] <%krispen_wa> My school bully kicked kids in the dick
[1:23:32] <+Byronic_dreamer> kids are evil
[1:23:36] <JustYudha> "Yeah lets bully him by taking out his dick and looking at it!" Thats so stupid
[1:23:37] <Profmcstevie> Violation of personal space is unpleasant
[1:23:38] <%monsieurfantastic> not when your dick is huge
[1:23:38] <@Moobot> Check out Sea of Solitude here! https://bit.ly/3r5tkX3
[1:23:38] <$Dakuu75> Yep, kids are pieces of shit
[1:23:39] <+Local16> It's public humiliation is all it is
[1:23:39] <iosephe> LADDER
[1:23:41] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[1:23:41] <mar_krow> It’s really not beyond bullying
[1:23:41] <%Necnill> Learn to dunk, it's the only way
[1:23:42] <TurtlesAndTentacles> it is. and this is why you get your ass kicked when you fuck with people. fuck bullies
[1:23:42] <+tigerfang86> EIGHT FOOT VERTICAL LEAP pat
[1:23:43] <%Broand> The worst thing is that the bullies will probably never think this game is realistic
[1:23:48] <%ClericOfSparda> Getting your pants pulled down in public is embarrassing
[1:23:50] <+kmckbxd> "i've never had this experience so it never happens"
[1:23:52] <%Alazull> COME ON AND SLAM! WELCOME TO THE JAM!
[1:23:55] <heartlesshealer> this is part of why we had all the 6th grade teachers patrol the school during lunch and recess
[1:23:56] <%BoxNavy> man at least during covid kids wont get bullied this bad
[1:24:00] <triggersqueeze1985> Jim gotta small one Haha
[1:24:02] <%MisterRockett> A girl once accidentally pants me cause she thought I'd look cooler if I was sagging.
[1:24:06] <NeroInfinite> If your dick is huge in japan youg et giga bullied because the norm is tiny pp
[1:24:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> I never experienced physical bullying. It was all verbal, leaving me a perpetually seething mess with a hair trigger
[1:24:08] <DemonsEcho272> I only got bullied by one person and I tried to kill him.
[1:24:09] <+Gamblitz> sunny. show them you globetrotter basketball skills
[1:24:11] <%lumporr> you guys ever have "table-topping" get popular at your schools
[1:24:11] <%MisterRockett> In the 6th grade
[1:24:11] <%JohnAtDawn> SUBTITLE MISTAKE
[1:24:12] <deviljhojho_> oh fuck do they really do pantsing? i thought it was a weird movie thing
[1:24:14] <LeeOhX> teachers be like "kids will be kids"

[1:24:31] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I was joking before, but this really is a hate crime
[1:24:31] <%KineticZen> Or any with a hint of a social media presence
[1:24:31] <%Infernal_Dalek> or siblings
[1:24:31] <deviljhojho_> silver linings tomatoSmile
[1:24:31] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[1:24:34] <Torgue_1> Or siblings. Don't forget about them
[1:24:36] <DaKnightWarrior> Man NotLikeThis
[1:24:36] <+tigerfang86> THERE ARE SO MANY SHITKIDS NOW
[1:24:37] <+UnabashedGarbage> Yeah... unfortunately some parents are the worst bullies imaginable
[1:24:38] <%KineticZen> Since that's the refuge of bullying cowards nowadays
[1:24:40] <worldbrand> <sound of hollowing>
[1:24:44] <%asgard147> limesFeels
[1:24:44] <Rojahh> I remember the nastiest girls filling a girl's locker with shaving cream cause she was little "hairy"
[1:24:45] <%cvp5127> cyber bullying got that covered
[1:24:46] <+tigerfang86> it's an ARMY OF SHITKIDS
[1:24:47] <%lumporr> the kids will never be safe
[1:24:48] <%JumboCrunchies> Now Bullying comes at you straight from your phone. Cyberbullying is real.
[1:24:49] <%goose_attack_almanac> Having to use social media for classes also gives your bullies a direct line to you at home.
[1:24:50] <+Shacklebox> Double dose of parent ass kicking for 1 whole year and some change
[1:24:50] <%jarednotwithsubway> unless they get bullied by their teachers, like the deaf girl who was berated for "not listening"
[1:24:51] <%coward_man> also cyberbullying
[1:24:55] <%Infernal_Dalek> Oh no you're getting pantsed
[1:24:59] <%Nested_Dreams> @boxnavy Nah, they will instead get the bullying via exclusion and ignoring
[1:25:02] <revoltingimp> this encounter design is bleh
[1:25:02] <mar_krow> COVID kids find out their parents don’t want to be around them too
[1:25:02] <%wibbwobbler> hrrmm
[1:25:07] <Shining_Armor> Furries don't wear pants, Dalek
[1:25:13] <%goose_attack_almanac> oppressive?

[1:25:29] <+tigerfang86> Bird be vibin

[1:25:36] <alcett> man I just don't get how some kids can be so mean-spirited and some can be so sweet. wild
[1:25:38] <deviljhojho_> sesame street vibes
[1:25:45] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Some kids just need the cruelty beat out of them while they're young
[1:25:48] <%Infernal_Dalek> Those snores
[1:25:50] <%lumporr> this is teaching an important message: if you wanna deal with your bullies you deal with it on the BASKETBALL COURT

[1:26:16] <%JumboCrunchies> I was bullied relentlessly, but I am so fucking thankful I wasn't in grade school when Cellphones were commonplace. I can't imagine how I would have survived if the bullies were able to follow me home and message me all night.
[1:26:17] <%shurtal> lovely dorge
[1:26:18] <vVAstrAVv> oh no his bird pants

[1:27:30] <mar_krow> Dog snores is helping
[1:27:33] <%goatbait> This game is giving me anxiety
[1:27:34] <Ipsenscastle> In high school my best friend got me an 'asshole of the year' certificate and got literally everyone I knew to sign it. It hurt way more than any other bullying including being stabbed repeatedly with a fountain pen
[1:27:34] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Yeah this is bringing up some stuff
[1:27:35] <NeroInfinite> ...
[1:27:35] <+Shacklebox> Zangief has never been bullied and is not invested in this game
[1:27:37] <dereksbales> i was bullied harder then that so its just normal shit to me
[1:27:38] <%Necnill> In which we collectively realise we need therapy
[1:27:38] <triggersqueeze1985> Gief sounds like a 49 year old alcoholic
[1:27:39] <Shining_Armor> "Sis why are you a bird?"
[1:27:39] <deviljhojho_> OH NO NO NO NO
[1:27:39] <LeeOhX> ITS PAT
[1:27:40] <%shurtal> Least you got gief there to lighten the mood

[1:27:43] <mar_krow> Through this
[1:27:43] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Oh no wonder they bullied him
[1:27:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @coward_man Ehh Idk I think good people can sometimes be the shittiest parents of all by not holding their kids accountable
[1:27:44] <Sparda_blizzard> looooool
[1:27:44] <olaksi> okay then the bullying is fair
[1:27:44] <NeroInfinite> He don't even look that bad

[1:27:52] <+LordSDB> NotLikeThis
[1:27:53] <%alcors_wisdom> art as a medium doesnt have to make you feel good many would argue that art that makes you feel bad is intrinsically more valuable

[1:28:24] <%JumboCrunchies> That means NOTHING
[1:28:25] <+BubbaRands> Man him being ginger with freckles somehow explains so much
[1:28:25] <%BoxNavy> yeah you love it
[1:28:31] <NeroInfinite> I member when kids tried to bully me in school, good thing I was too damn dumb to understand it.
[1:28:32] <+tigerfang86> that would NEVER stop shitty kids
[1:28:33] <%GarbageQueenEllie> "Remember kids: if you see someone being unkind, fucking FATALITY!!!!"
[1:28:34] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Fair
[1:28:34] <%SomersaultJustice> this build of the game was made specifically for pat
[1:28:35] <Tuna_Can_0> too close to home atpRtsd
[1:28:35] <@SoFarFetched> Its literally "You have long hair for a boy? WOW must be a girl"

[1:29:48] <deviljhojho_> if it works it works

[1:30:08] <%BinaryFireball> I threw mine in the bushes in front of the whole class after kicking his ass. He stopped then
[1:30:09] <%Infernal_Dalek> I was tripped in the hallway, and as I got up I threw an elbow to their stomach, then knee'd them in the head when they hunched over.
[1:30:10] <+UnabashedGarbage> I got my highschool bully kicked of the football team and almost expelled

[1:30:31] <TurtlesAndTentacles> threw a book at mine. straddled and punched another. fuck bullies.
[1:30:31] <%Broken_Sonex> No that’s the appropriate response
[1:30:33] <%PanicSwytch> My bully thought I would never fight him and then I smashed his head on the gym bleacher...he never bothered me after that
[1:30:33] <%DakotaMacDoodle> I eventually learned that non-reaction made them boarded then it stopped thankfully
[1:30:37] <Warbot40> Had 1 or 2 breakdowns in middle school. Wasn't fun.

[1:36:48] <%Infernal_Dalek> it's important to focus on the roaming monster that will eat you, instead of that passive one

[1:38:11] <ScreamLord> why?
[1:38:12] <NeroInfinite> That seems a bit a jank
[1:38:13] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5Tuntun uyuyuyuTokichan ?
[1:38:14] <%MisterRockett> Why did you just stand there????
[1:38:15] <%Dementedpenguin> wtf
[1:38:17] <DaKnightWarrior> really LUL
[1:38:18] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Telefrag water lol
[1:38:19] <%coward_man> this one thankfully doesn't hit home for me, my parents split when I was young and get on better now
[1:38:24] <%asgard147> abit jank
[1:38:25] <heartlesshealer> did the game freeze you in place or something?
[1:38:29] <skyentombment> Hey Pat, I stopped having a shit miserable time at school at around 3rd semester in high school, when would you say it happened for you if at all?
[1:38:38] <triggersqueeze1985> Death counter up to 34
[1:38:40] <mar_krow> Dad fucking the secretary
[1:38:46] <%Fooguwu> pat took mental damage and forgot the game for a sec
[1:38:49] <triggersqueeze1985> 35
[1:38:58] <%KineticZen> Gee, that doesn't sound familiar at all
[1:39:08] <+Gamblitz> You know I think that fish thing is kay anxiety/depression manifested.
[1:39:09] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Yeah I feel that
[1:39:10] <%asgard147> Didn't you go to the food court above work once?
[1:39:12] <%Agami23> pat, the freezers broke again, time to get to mopping
[1:39:12] <deviljhojho_> happened to me in college too
[1:39:14] <%Necnill> Me with chronic ills some peeps don't believe feeling really weird about this chapter
[1:39:19] <%whyskeywolfe> I still do that at my government job after management started targeting me for my Union work.
[1:39:20] <skyentombment> So college, pretty reasonable
[1:39:21] <LVL1_Scumbag> That's right
[1:39:21] <deviljhojho_> college is just more relaxin and chillaxin
[1:39:23] <%anticrust> last 2 years of high school
[1:39:24] <amiavamp> I deal with a lot of bs in work but im glad i havent had to deal with shittier coworkers
[1:39:26] <Ipsenscastle> uni was also almost as bad
[1:39:27] <Link232> Yep, fuck HS
[1:39:27] <%ClericOfSparda> This is $6 on Steam. is it worth dealing with EA play for this?
[1:39:27] <Srthunda> a classic
[1:39:29] <CoffeeSlice> YEA
[1:39:31] <%monsieurfantastic> smart
[1:39:33] <%poisin224> fair tbh
[1:39:33] <DaKnightWarrior> me too.
[1:39:34] <%curiour> I used to go into our restroom at work when I was working retail and I would just take really long breaks seething in rage so me coworkers couldn't see me
[1:39:36] <CoffeeSlice> thats the best
[1:39:36] <Tracazoid> Haha that's what I do
[1:39:37] <%BoxNavy> smart
[1:39:37] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Yeah doing that is great
[1:39:39] <+Shacklebox> Dude one of my bullies was a grade below me it was embarrassing as shit
[1:39:40] <deviljhojho_> JUST REMEMR KIDS: Dont peak at college like me
[1:39:41] <BerryliciousDefinition> Good move
[1:39:42] <TurtlesAndTentacles> pat was no one nice to you in high school?
[1:39:44] <%Divryne> When I got my license the first thing I did was ditch classes every couple of days and just drive around in the town.
[1:39:45] <Torgue_1> Did they try to get your attention?
[1:39:46] <%whyskeywolfe> It's a shame. I used to love working there too.
[1:39:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> For me, the shit stopped in college because no one had time for that shit
[1:39:48] <%wibbwobbler> that definitely works lmao
[1:39:51] <+BubbaRands> Moving hundreds of miles away from your town can help with that too
[1:39:52] <deviljhojho_> i actually didnt tho
[1:39:55] <xtanded100> Same.
[1:39:56] <DusK_The_Stray> My high school wasn't too bad, I fought all of my bullies in middle school and we went to the same high school so no one fucked with me.
[1:40:05] <%anticrust> HE PWOMISED
[1:40:10] <skyentombment> Most of the people I hated and made me miserable went to a different high school
[1:40:11] <dereksbales> you didnt have friends from high school?
[1:40:12] <%solracc25> That's a sound plan pat
[1:40:12] <%wibbwobbler> i want to try that?
[1:40:13] <deviljhojho_> woah
[1:40:14] <Bigyanno> Highschool was constant misery. I used to vomit every single morning because I was so anxious. I sometimes just skipped whole weeks and stood in a fucking field in the rain all day in winter rather than face that place. I fucking HATED highschool
[1:40:20] <+thelonechris> Oof
[1:40:20] <DusK_The_Stray> The teachers in high school were so much worse to me than any bully
[1:40:22] <deviljhojho_> pfffft
[1:40:24] <heartlesshealer> for me it happened when I left middle school because the bullies got fucked up by family life
[1:40:29] <worldbrand> i'm just realizing that i witnessed zero instances of bullying in college
[1:40:31] <%GarbageNirvana> oof
[1:40:32] <%poisin224> ugh "stop being a brat" to mean "stop being upset" is the worst
[1:40:34] <LunarRemix> Just calmly explain the situation?
[1:40:38] <heartlesshealer> after that it was just minimal socialization
[1:40:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> @bigyanno cranky5Pat cranky5Pat cranky5Pat
[1:40:39] <triggersqueeze1985> 36
[1:40:40] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5Tuntun uyuyuyuTokichan ? uyuyuyuUshi1 ?
[1:40:42] <LunarRemix> Sit down and have a talk, calmly
[1:40:43] <deviljhojho_> gotta take that one in the jaw
[1:40:44] <mar_krow> 36
[1:40:45] <%GarbageQueenEllie> My xp w bullying wasnt nearly as bad as this stuff, but it still hurt. I was lucky
[1:40:45] <%Garthunox> I had a guy IN COLLEGE try to start a fight with me, he came up to me and started talking shit to me while i was with a big friend group, he smacked the cigarette out of my mouth and I just looked at him like "really?"
[1:40:52] <mar_krow> Yup
[1:40:54] <%KineticZen> High school wasn't that bad but I was just that guy that didn't fit in with any group at all
[1:40:56] <%Agami23> thats when you throw the dad under the bus as hard as possible
[1:40:59] <BerryliciousDefinition> That angry "Im sorry" is just...oof
[1:41:01] <deviljhojho_> @Garthunox lmao why?
[1:41:06] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I loved high school. I told the teacher when I was bullied or I fought back or my mom would come up there. and let me tell you a Black woman born in 50 doesn't take shit from anyone
[1:41:08] <%BoxNavy> but why
[1:41:15] <%scottmou> scottmou subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! best stream since the Mississippi river
[1:41:16] <%ClericOfSparda> This is $6 on Steam. is dealing with EA play worth it?
[1:41:18] <%juxtest> Make a new dad in a cave with a box of scraps
[1:41:18] <%BoxNavy> huh?
[1:41:27] <%solracc25> That's BA
[1:41:30] <%Garthunox> @deviljhojho_ I called him out in the middle of class for acting like a cunt
[1:41:36] <amiavamp> Bullies in college must be some truly spoiled mfers to not care about the $$$ they would waste from getting booted out
[1:41:38] <%solracc25> Tim Rogers is nuts
[1:41:42] <ScreamLord> Are the controls fucked or something? There are times you just stop and let the monster kill you or go backwards
[1:41:55] <DaKnightWarrior> GOOD!
[1:41:56] <deviljhojho_> @Garthunox oh i thought he was just doing a yakuza style random encounter
[1:42:01] <%Necnill> Woof
[1:42:05] <%GarbageNirvana> YEYEYEYE
[1:42:05] <%poisin224> like from the movie A christmas Story?
[1:42:07] <%BoxNavy> ye
[1:42:08] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Good for Tim
[1:42:08] <%Daxalog> V I O L E N C E
[1:42:09] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Wow
[1:42:11] <%curiour> pat have you ever had that moment in retail while on shift that just broke you with how angry you got?
[1:42:13] <+captain_thickthighs> and the crowd goes silent
[1:42:14] <%KineticZen> Wow
[1:42:14] <deviljhojho_> yeah they dont give a shit if you kick their asses
[1:42:16] <Smokin_Fish> cool twitch died halfway through that story
[1:42:17] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> That's about right
[1:42:17] <%whyskeywolfe> Sounds like he needed another lesson.
[1:42:19] <%coward_man> @PatStaresAt I had that MULTIPLE TIMES!
[1:42:21] <%wibbwobbler> lol
[1:42:22] <TurtlesAndTentacles> keep beating their ass
[1:42:24] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Some people are just bad
[1:42:28] <dereksbales> "my dad hits me harder"
[1:42:29] <+Shacklebox> free ass kickings
[1:42:31] <revoltingimp> "Is that a Heat Move notification over his head?"
[1:42:33] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Gotta beat on him some more then. Rip and tear, until it is done.
[1:42:35] <%Broand> Someone tried bullying me in secondary school. But after elementary school, his shit was amateur hour
[1:42:35] <%Necnill> Because it's rarely about the bullying dynamic itself, I guess
[1:42:37] <LunarRemix> Life will (Not) change
[1:42:38] <heartlesshealer> sounds like a waste of mother's labor
[1:42:38] <%whyskeywolfe> It's because the little shit's pride is invested in his bullying now.
[1:42:42] <Tracazoid> Yeah the fight back thing and stand up for yourself isn't always true
[1:42:43] <%curiour> ah, but you can try
[1:42:44] <%Garthunox> You cant polish a turd
[1:42:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> Beat up your bully and steal one of their bones. Continue until you can build an anatomical diorama.
[1:42:45] <Torgue_1> That's just the way it is
[1:42:46] <%coward_man> I put 2 kids in the hospital and with casts on they kept being shits
[1:42:48] <aura_00> i finished high school last year but i also found out i have cronic depression so that's pretty neat
[1:42:50] <TurtlesAndTentacles> do not let Bob Ross hear you say that
[1:42:51] <%GarbageNirvana> And that's when you turn him into a training rival
[1:42:51] <%Dementedpenguin> Real life isn't like a Japanese redemption story. Kappa
[1:42:51] <LunarRemix> I wonder what's Persona answer to that
[1:42:52] <Reckless_Rob> Kiryu can
[1:42:53] <%Broken_Sonex> Just keep beating on him then
[1:42:54] <+captain_thickthighs> oddest is seeing that person become and adult and in a position of power
[1:42:57] <Smokin_Fish> you can, but usually the life get beat out along with it
[1:42:57] <DusK_The_Stray> Yeah, the extra combo after the KO, pretty satisfying
[1:42:59] <deviljhojho_> when i was in fifth grade me and some other kid kept beating the shit out of each other and we became sort of friends
[1:42:59] <SolumFuturae> beat them deep
[1:43:03] <vVAstrAVv> if i dont change you never beat me
[1:43:03] <NeroInfinite> I had a few friends in High schooland my time in HS was generally..boring otuside of teachers literally not teaching me a great deal.
[1:43:06] <triggersqueeze1985> Murder then
[1:43:08] <Mariakko> What if we beat them harder?
[1:43:09] <%solracc25> YOU CAN TRY THOUGH
[1:43:11] <%whyskeywolfe> Best you can do is let them know picking on you comes with a cost. Then they fuck off to bother someone else.
[1:43:17] <ChungusQuest> I feel like I'm one of those people, except my evil is laziness.
[1:43:25] <deviljhojho_> born this way
[1:43:25] <LeeOhX> Keep beating them, im sure something will stick
[1:43:27] <%Daxalog> Zzsazz
[1:43:28] <%asgard147> It's kinda sad limesFeels
[1:43:28] <%krispen_wa> most people are just okay though
[1:43:29] <%DakotaMacDoodle> True
[1:43:31] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Your Brother Huh?
[1:43:32] <%DianaTheAscian> yes
[1:43:32] <DusK_The_Stray> Just beat them harder. Eventually they'll get tired of the beatings
[1:43:34] <leinadtonu> some people simply shouldn't be.
[1:43:34] <ScreamLord> They were just born with evil in their soul
[1:43:35] <%Daxalog> Zazz from batman
[1:43:37] <%whyskeywolfe> They didn't get thrown into the Joker Acid?
[1:43:39] <SolumFuturae> That was when I discovered what trolling was after I got internet.
[1:43:41] <+captain_thickthighs> i wonder if theres an asshole gene?
[1:43:42] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[1:43:46] <%Agami23> like woolie trying to understand everyone
[1:43:49] <mar_krow> I can’t fight a person only spitting words but if they swing I can
[1:43:51] <+UnabashedGarbage> Some people are just assholes to the core
[1:43:51] <%Garthunox> Anyone who beats a partner is scum and should just d word
[1:43:52] <NeroInfinite> Sometimes people are just assholes.
[1:43:52] <%curiour> Trauma is the fastest way to maturity. which sucks because most people who have that, didn't deserve it
[1:43:56] <+fromnibelheim> just nature, not nurture I guess
[1:43:58] <CoffeeSlice> ye
[1:44:00] <dereksbales> psych major
[1:44:03] <Shining_Armor> Evil exists. Sometimes that's all there is to it.
[1:44:04] <TurtlesAndTentacles> yep
[1:44:08] <heartlesshealer> sometimes it's a brain thing too, and that's when it extra sucks
[1:44:11] <%spitelite> cuz they can
[1:44:11] <DaKnightWarrior> That's true
[1:44:12] <revoltingimp> but why tho
[1:44:15] <iosephe> Because it works for them
[1:44:21] <+captain_thickthighs> preach
[1:44:21] <Tracazoid> Yeah, simple as that. No underlying motive or life experience that caused it, they're just shits
[1:44:22] <+tigerfang86> cause they choose to be
[1:44:22] <Ipsenscastle> If someone keeps making selfish / cruel decisions and then lazily justifying their own shitty behaviour, they become irrevocable assholes, that's all it is
[1:44:23] <skyentombment> @worldbrand Well, I figure one of 3 things happened, a)the bullies graduated to real crimes, b) they dropped out or c)very unlikely , they mellowed out and went unpunished
[1:44:25] <worldbrand> yeah that's my brother
[1:44:25] <+Kenzo2000> It's like trying to explain comedy, eventually you just have to say "this is funny."
[1:44:27] <%Broken_Sonex> Sometimes people brains are just made that way
[1:44:29] <%solracc25> Some people are just not people
[1:44:29] <SolumFuturae> 100%
[1:44:33] <%RD_nx> almost all the bullys in my school had police fathers
[1:44:37] <TurtlesAndTentacles> this game makes me big sad
[1:44:38] <%poisin224> Sadge
[1:44:42] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Jaaaaail
[1:44:42] <deviljhojho_> sometimes you gotta know when to fold em
[1:44:43] <%wibbwobbler> very true
[1:44:44] <%JD_Lars> Why can’t this person just not litter? psaSmug
[1:44:45] <+Gamblitz> clinical narcissm
[1:44:51] <ScreamLord> Or executioner
[1:44:54] <%Nested_Dreams> I simply called upon the school regulation, does that not work outside of europe?
[1:44:54] <%KineticZen> Thankfully everyone isn't like that
[1:44:54] <%coward_man> I swear to god if I had time travel capability there are like 5 people I would happily strangle to death and I would have not one regret
[1:44:56] <iosephe> Occasionally warden
[1:44:57] <%Agami23> pat are you just talking about your brother again?
[1:45:04] <%krispen_wa> Humans can sometimes be programmed differently
[1:45:05] <@Moobot> Check out Sea of Solitude here! https://bit.ly/3r5tkX3
[1:45:06] <leinadtonu> ...lobotomist...
[1:45:06] <Smokin_Fish> ayy you're talking about my brother
[1:45:06] <%BoxNavy> pat do you actually for real litter on purpose?
[1:45:07] <Manwad> I love these discussions and games that prompt said discussions
[1:45:07] <+Shacklebox> well maybe you repeat a few steps there but yeah
[1:45:10] <iceballstwitch> this is a very podcast-y stream
[1:45:11] <%whyskeywolfe> Remember all of you: you're worth more than spending your time on them. Take it from an old fart.
[1:45:14] <triggersqueeze1985> Executioner tho?
[1:45:14] <@commanderclaw> And at a certain level, the lawmakers
[1:45:15] <%Garthunox> HA!
[1:45:22] <%goose_attack_almanac> There's nothing to understand. If there's a bag of garbage leaking into the street I wouldn't dig around in it to find out whats causing the leak
[1:45:24] <%curiour> well does your brother fit into any of these archetypes?
[1:45:26] <%RyTYoung> !uptime
[1:45:27] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 45m.
[1:45:30] <jowi_time> and ontario
[1:45:31] <dereksbales> lit
[1:45:35] <%Garthunox> Saaaame
[1:45:38] <%krispen_wa> @whyskeywolfe but what if i find dissecting how stupid people are to be fun
[1:45:38] <+UnabashedGarbage> @Nested_Dreams Depends on the school, at least in the US. That's how I got my bully to leave me alone, but that didn't work when I was in middle school.
[1:45:42] <LeeOhX> oog
[1:45:43] <%DianaTheAscian> oh werid
[1:45:50] <%asgard147> oof
[1:45:51] <DaKnightWarrior> sad
[1:45:56] <deviljhojho_> maybe 7?
[1:46:01] <dereksbales> from little turd to big bump
[1:46:01] <Badgerconda_> And then if you're Pat, you stay a little person forever.
[1:46:04] <%cvp5127> like 5
[1:46:07] <%DianaTheAscian> 3
[1:46:07] <Yung_FckUp> i dont remember being 4
[1:46:08] <+captain_thickthighs> one girl that was a bitch in highschool and lost most of her freinds still tried to pull rank while i was working. She left customs without the permission to "tell me" to hold the flight for her. We didn't obviosly and she had to pay customs a fine
[1:46:10] <%goose_attack_almanac> Quick Question Pat, how many people named Gavin have you met that have been assholes?
[1:46:11] <+Shacklebox> that's weird, I went to like five different schools by the time I hit highschool
[1:46:11] <%KineticZen> I don't remember the kids I grew up with being so rigidly formed. Some assholes mellowed out
[1:46:11] <heartlesshealer> around there where you feel like a weird living camera
[1:46:12] <+unhuggable1> sucks
[1:46:20] <amiavamp> Thats insaneto think about, i can point to specific phases i went through in mental maturity
[1:46:23] <Bigyanno> Not all people are assholes from childhood to adulthood. Some start really nice then become assholes out of fucking nowhere
[1:46:24] <revoltingimp> 2 i think here
[1:46:27] <%DianaTheAscian> I remember being 2
[1:46:28] <+BubbaRands> And then they become politicians 4Head
[1:46:39] <+gimmickypizza> Is it because the French
[1:46:44] <+unhuggable1> some kids parents were really fuckin mean
[1:46:46] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah, you kind of become the foundation of who you're going to be by 4
[1:46:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> BUT MEEEEEEEEEE
[1:46:52] <+Gamblitz> speaking of your brother. I finally beat the first Command and Conquer the other day
[1:46:52] <Tuna_Can_0> narcissists atpCap
[1:46:53] <Kalarchis> Empathy and self-reflection are part of your wiring and some people simply were born without those wires
[1:46:54] <%curiour> 3 here, my first memory is of a donut
[1:46:56] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Yeah, from elementary to adult, some people don't actually change who they are, they just find new hobbies and interests relevant to their age and environment
[1:46:56] <deviljhojho_> most assholes i met mellowed out, some of them didnt even know they were being assholes. But i do know some that never reformed
[1:47:04] <%Fooguwu> that too is a sort of genetic disorder of its own
[1:47:05] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Isn't narcissism a disorder?
[1:47:07] <leinadtonu> Sound like that oppositional defiant thing
[1:47:11] <+captain_thickthighs> @goose_attack_almanac dude my old boss gavin was a dick. he would check on me in the bathroom when i had the shits everyday cause he though i was doing drugs.
[1:47:14] <+UnabashedGarbage> People with NPD can be insufferable
[1:47:15] <%MisterRockett> I blame the parents in those instances.
[1:47:21] <%luftraumm1> psycho sexual development?
[1:47:21] <+boki_86> is this the new version of the game?
[1:47:26] <Badgerconda_> There's a difference between being a narcissist and just being narcissistic, though.
[1:47:40] <ScreamLord> My first memory is of a weird ass dream of me and my mom walking down an H.R Geiger flesh/chitin tunnel followed by me waking up with piss in my pants. At 4 years old
[1:47:44] <+tigerfang86> trueeee
[1:47:50] <Rojahh> Cough Cough DSP cough cough LTG
[1:47:54] <%BoxNavy> can narcissism affect you personally?
[1:47:58] <+boki_86> !Sos
[1:47:58] <@Moobot> Check out Sea of Solitude here! https://bit.ly/3r5tkX3
[1:47:58] <Matt_Cowdery> people have volition and sometimes they just use it to be shitty
[1:48:09] <@commanderclaw> You can say that it's a bad trait, which is different
[1:48:11] <+captain_thickthighs> so whats a disorder vs a bad personality trait
[1:48:13] <%Nested_Dreams> Wasn't there some research on children not being able to empathize with pain unless they experience that pain?
[1:48:15] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Disorder is when they literally can't stop when it's causing every problem in their life, and need help
[1:48:16] <%krispen_wa> this is why the idea of heaven or hell gets interesting. because what if someone is just literally born to not be able to feel empathy?
[1:48:17] <NeroInfinite> The dark empaths are dangerous.
[1:48:24] <%Garthunox> Isnt lack of empathy Sociopathy?
[1:48:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Would these assholes qualify as Chaotic Evil or Neutral Evil?
[1:48:29] <%Nested_Dreams> gotta dig up the magazines
[1:48:31] <%wibbwobbler> some people just don't care
[1:48:31] <%lumporr> huh
[1:48:35] <Profmcstevie> Sometimes empathy just gets smothered by spite
[1:48:36] <%juxtest> My friend has a mental disorder that makes him not get me a Snickers
[1:48:39] <+boki_86> so this version is switch exclusive
[1:48:42] <%krispen_wa> do you condemn a psrson to hell for something they were born with?
[1:48:43] <heartlesshealer> on YOUR life, specifically
[1:48:44] <+Shacklebox> like DAMAGING
[1:48:53] <%lumporr> functional alcoholic
[1:48:54] <Badgerconda_> lack of empathy is part of a lot of different things, it's one of the traits of antisocial personality disorder/sociopathy.
[1:48:57] <amiavamp> Empathy is partly taught/enforced, and partly inherent...if someone doesnt have the inherent part they may not care about the other part
[1:48:59] <+captain_thickthighs> this is fascinating
[1:49:02] <%jessyg920> Yay! that's me!
[1:49:03] <%GarbageNirvana> This is actually what Pat went to school for so
[1:49:04] <%coward_man> yeah my dad is currently functional alcoholic
[1:49:06] <%curiour> never stays there for long though
[1:49:08] <+Shacklebox> the buffer of, it's getting there
[1:49:10] <@commanderclaw> But their liver is fucked now
[1:49:10] <NeroInfinite> @juxtest That's not a mental disorder, that's doing you a favor. LUL
[1:49:12] <+tigerfang86> y e t
[1:49:18] <%lumporr> ahhhh fuck
[1:49:19] <+Gamblitz> acceptable range
[1:49:19] <Yung_FckUp> yea but drunk driving is cool
[1:49:20] <%solracc25> One time a kid, this is highschool, was being a real shit to a teacher that the teacher said: "You know your parents are paying for you to be here. My salary from you is like 50 cents. Here take your money and go if you don't want to be here." as she slams down 50 cents on the desk
[1:49:22] <deviljhojho_> rip liver
[1:49:23] <mar_krow> Parents be making kids but not raising a them or having time too or just make their mistakes the kids problem
[1:49:25] <ToneBacas> one more beer and it's a disorder
[1:49:25] <Kalarchis> I know a guy who is sociopathic to other people but super empathetic towards animals
[1:49:31] <%Pappajimbo> when booze runs out then the fun starts
[1:49:34] <heartlesshealer> if god real, god condemns people to hell. Humans can only be either nice, indifferent, or assholes to each other
[1:49:35] <CoffeeSlice> i like hearing pat talk about psych stuff
[1:49:36] <+captain_thickthighs> honestly i would love you to wax poetic more on mental stuff
[1:49:39] <joec182> but most disorders arent visible
[1:49:42] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt those sound uncommon
[1:49:53] <deviljhojho_> thats a rare one
[1:49:56] <$vehementvadr> that's just plague
[1:50:07] <%krispen_wa> or just a real good time with animals
[1:50:11] <+boki_86> well i like animals also more than people
[1:50:12] <deviljhojho_> can you be an armchari psychologist if you have an actual degree?
[1:50:12] <%Broken_Sonex> Plague?
[1:50:14] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah, sounds like it
[1:50:14] <%BoxNavy> BA = butass
[1:50:17] <%coward_man> my dad's a functional alcoholic but thankfully he's making an attempt to stop drinking
[1:50:17] <+UnabashedGarbage> That's how my older brother is. Like's animals, hates people. He has BPD and had an abusive father
[1:50:17] <+Shacklebox> People are mean
[1:50:17] <%BoxNavy> buttass*
[1:50:18] <@commanderclaw> Humans gave you reasons to not care about them
[1:50:18] <%solracc25> Animals don't judge you
[1:50:18] <joec182> wait psych is an art?
[1:50:21] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> VERY TRUE
[1:50:21] <%KineticZen> With animals, you usually get what you put in
[1:50:21] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Someone to make you think people suck
[1:50:22] <%Puhff> Yeah that's prolly abuse related
[1:50:24] <%KineticZen> With people, no
[1:50:25] <%curiour> have family problems pat, can confirm, love my dog, not my mom
[1:50:26] <+Shacklebox> That's fair, people are evil
[1:50:27] <Profmcstevie> Betrayal scars the heart real good
[1:50:27] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> @captain_thickthighs Ditto. This is the most I've ever learned in a Pat stream
[1:50:31] <+captain_thickthighs> pat you need a blazer with elbow pads
[1:50:32] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Pat smart
[1:50:32] <+Shacklebox> dog never hated anyone
[1:50:32] <Ipsenscastle> yeah that accurately describes me, i no longer trust people
[1:50:34] <Badgerconda_> Yeah, that's likely someone with a history of trauma.
[1:50:35] <Ball_Bag_Goblin> But people ARE horrible
[1:50:35] <EvilErickan> isnt that adolf?
[1:50:38] <Ipsenscastle> my cat is lovely though
[1:50:45] <%krispen_wa> Animals have no choice. humans can choose to be assholes
[1:50:46] <Link232> I really appreciate Psych Talk with Pat
[1:50:50] <RayCSmooth> that's me
[1:50:53] <+tigerfang86> the pulsing light and steam has huge migrane energy

[1:50:59] <Rojahh> bite your penis
[1:50:59] <%Daxalog> Eat your controllers?
[1:51:00] <%KineticZen> Reciprocity is the difference in relating well with animals, and not with humans
[1:51:00] <%Infernal_Dalek> Cum in your ear?
[1:51:01] <%DianaTheAscian> thats why so many people love pets and not there kids
[1:51:01] <Mikers29> steal money from you
[1:51:01] <SolumFuturae> I would love to see Pat go on Healthy Gamer

[1:51:05] <Torgue_1> Eat your food when you aren't looking?
[1:51:05] <+Shacklebox> when dogs are bad they don't know better, when people are bad it's because they're evil
[1:51:05] <Tracazoid> Poop in your mouth on the daily
[1:51:05] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Paige doesn't trust him with her blankets
[1:51:06] <%asgard147> bite you
[1:51:06] <%UvBenServed> Eat Paige
[1:51:06] <reonome> eat paige
[1:51:06] <revoltingimp> start biting you for no reason
[1:51:06] <%Garthunox> He could betray the Tojo
[1:51:06] <%lumporr> humans have so few data points that their views of things can get skewed if for instance, they experience a bunch of shitty people in a row
[1:51:06] <Bigyanno> He could do paige
[1:51:09] <Profmcstevie> Maul you
[1:51:11] <%BoxNavy> put his dick in your ear
[1:51:11] <%mike2hands> yeah that too

[1:51:30] <%solracc25> cum on your face while you sleem
[1:51:31] <deviljhojho_> you can probably take zangief in a fight
[1:51:33] <+Gamblitz> college talk. was Macro Economics. part of General education requirement?
[1:51:33] <Ball_Bag_Goblin> gud dug
[1:51:36] <heartlesshealer> that usually happens when pet old and brain things happen to them
[1:51:38] <%Spydurman> @PatStaresAt this makes me think how I'm an extremely low empathy person but relatively normal sympathy. Has me come off as cold to some people
[1:51:38] <Lion_kun> Rub his dick in your face?
[1:51:38] <%whyskeywolfe> Lotta you guys thinking one thing huh
[1:51:39] <%DianaTheAscian> very rare
[1:51:39] <%curiour> if kid mauls pet, kid has to go, big uno reverse card
[1:51:39] <%GarbageNirvana> Usually doesn't happen without provocation
[1:51:39] <%UvBenServed> Gief is more likely to crush than anything
[1:51:40] <%Garthunox> Then that kid has to deal with a fear of dogs
[1:51:43] <NeroInfinite> Unless you're a piece of food gief won't maul you.
[1:51:45] <%goose_attack_almanac> yeah
[1:51:47] <%Roasted_Pheasant> YUP
[1:51:48] <Badgerconda_> Those people are always shitty people.

[1:51:50] <%Garthunox> YES!
[1:51:51] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Had one in my house
[1:51:51] <Ball_Bag_Goblin> They're usually also crazy people.
[1:51:51] <%Mrbaconator> no
[1:51:52] <+Shacklebox> Zangief is gonna ruin your friendship by stealing your wife
[1:51:54] <%JumboCrunchies> Yep
[1:51:54] <%RyTYoung> Yeah that's not cool
[1:51:55] <Rablit> jjst popped in. this is not what i expected from this game.
[1:51:55] <LVL1_Scumbag> Luckily no
[1:51:56] <+captain_thickthighs> yup
[1:51:56] <%KineticZen> Negligent or bad ownership
[1:51:57] <%Roasted_Pheasant> It was "my fault"
[1:51:58] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, and it's like WHY????
[1:51:59] <revoltingimp> a fight between pat and gief would be like watching a pokemon battle
[1:52:00] <%DianaTheAscian> nope
[1:52:01] <DaKnightWarrior> no
[1:52:02] <%GarbageQueenEllie> i want Zangief to punch out all the Evil with his cute face
[1:52:03] <%BoxNavy> i dont know anyone with pets
[1:52:03] <%lumporr> is there a better litmus test?
[1:52:05] <joec182> yeah and they treat the dog as a princes
[1:52:05] <@Moobot> Check out Sea of Solitude here! https://bit.ly/3r5tkX3
[1:52:07] <s1rcuit> because they don't train their fucking dogs
[1:52:08] <%solracc25> yup
[1:52:08] <%goose_attack_almanac> They walk their dog at parks in a different town.
[1:52:11] <Zeif00> "not my problem"
[1:52:12] <%BoxNavy> bad training
[1:52:12] <+captain_thickthighs> not all government agencies work well in every country
[1:52:13] <%MidnightBurst12> neglect and/or abuse
[1:52:15] <%spitelite> yep bad owners suck
[1:52:17] <+UnabashedGarbage> I've met very few people that actually bother to train their dogs. 99% of the people I know with dogs have never trained them, my parents included.
[1:52:17] <deviljhojho_> man one of my dogs is an asshole, but the other one is a sweetheart. She doesnt bite but she is cranky as fuck
[1:52:19] <%solracc25> but only in defense to the owner
[1:52:19] <deviljhojho_> dunno why
[1:52:19] <%Jeemukun> neighbours dog once mauled my cats, don't remember if he got in shit for that or not
[1:52:21] <+Oricalcon_Arts> My cat and I were playing and he accidentally clawed into my knuckle so bad it hit a nerve and made the entire left side of my hand hurt for days WutFace
[1:52:21] <%Lion_kun> okay there's degrees of bit
[1:52:22] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Even if he shits on the floor too much, you just adapt to the reality that your dog refuses to shit outside, not stop trusting him like he's doing it to spite you or something
[1:52:24] <Badgerconda_> dogs are, to a large degree, a reflection of their humans.
[1:52:30] <%lumporr> "he doesn't bite me! if he did i'd kick his ass lol"
[1:52:35] <%Lion_kun> there's biting on the hand accidentally and there's attacking someone
[1:52:35] <heartlesshealer> They would just not report shit
[1:52:36] <+Shacklebox> I knew a guy who's dog maimed someone else's dog and they didn't know anything
[1:52:41] <deviljhojho_> THE PLAGUE
[1:52:42] <%GarbageNirvana> What if they only bit assholes
[1:52:42] <%Broand> hey look they're blowing off steam, better not get caught up in that!
[1:52:43] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I had a very bad experience with Dogs as a kid, I eventually got a cat to cope... But dogs still scare me to death
[1:52:46] <%KineticZen> Bulldogs are sweethearts, but even they can be trained badly
[1:52:48] <olaksi> grumpy people
[1:52:50] <reonome> he doesn't like monke tho
[1:52:50] <%curiour> people don't nurture their pets to not harbor agressive tendencies and it just gets engrained into their psyche
[1:52:51] <%GarbageQueenEllie> you did a good job, bruh
[1:52:51] <%BoxNavy> THE PLAGUE VIRUS monkaS
[1:52:51] <%Mrbaconator> makin sure he wasn't a racist dog
[1:52:52] <%Valdorick> Never raise your dog to be racist
[1:52:54] <%krispen_wa> PLAGUE
[1:52:55] <%coward_man> @PatStaresAt I had a dog who was well trained and the biggest baby around family but very... nervy around strangers for no reason, who then bit a postman
[1:52:55] <heartlesshealer> Paige did a damn good job
[1:52:56] <%UvBenServed> But Monke
[1:52:57] <Profmcstevie> He no like monkee....but he like people
[1:52:59] <Rojahh> only one was a friend who was a literal guard dog, albeit the dad had an anger problem
[1:53:01] <%Daxalog> Most people dont do that step. They just get it and forget it in their yard.
[1:53:01] <%Garthunox> Did Woolie ever resolve that Racist cat issue?
[1:53:01] <revoltingimp> does he like "the french"?
[1:53:02] <+Shacklebox> every dog can be trained badly
[1:53:02] <%solracc25> Hats
[1:53:03] <deviljhojho_> I actually worry about one of my dogs getting kidnapped because she likes people too much

[1:53:59] <%poisin224> postingWeirdChamp

[1:54:07] <deviljhojho_> young king james
[1:54:07] <%KineticZen> And it's always the dog that gets put down, never the owner that gets prohibited from future pet ownership
[1:54:08] <Profmcstevie> I'm bout to pet them wrong several times
[1:54:11] <+tigerfang86> OOOOOOOH
[1:54:12] <+JonathLP> how could woolie do that?
[1:54:13] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> psaBig psaWrong
[1:54:13] <%valriot> LUL
[1:54:14] <ScreamLord> I used to have neighbors who's Pomeranian would loose his fucking mind over meeting new people. You'd think he was YOUR dog you had for years with how much he instantly loved you
[1:54:14] <Badgerconda_> Woolie has a dog? D:
[1:54:20] <dk_scrub> Paige is getting famous in an SOML article on FB about Lola Bunny lol
[1:54:21] <%coward_man> his terrible taste comes from the british

[1:54:34] <%krispen_wa> LUL LUL LUL
[1:54:35] <NeroInfinite> It' ain't woolie you fools, stopt rying to guess.
[1:54:36] <heartlesshealer> petting the dog "wrong". That involves teaching the dog bad things
[1:54:36] <Ball_Bag_Goblin> Yeah it ain't our business
[1:54:40] <%BoxNavy> ☝️
[1:54:42] <%Broken_Sonex> Because he’s British
[1:54:42] <+tigerfang86> dont be a dumbass
[1:54:42] <Profmcstevie> Don't go digging
[1:54:45] <+tigerfang86> it's easy, chat
[1:54:46] <s1rcuit> my sister got bit by a dog during a part time job, bit right through her denim pants
[1:54:46] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> If the dog bites over less than an actual attack on them, then good owner shit is keeping them away from strangers
[1:54:47] <%BoxNavy> yeah chat thats rude lol
[1:54:48] <deviljhojho_> crikObject
[1:54:51] <%Puhff> it was me
[1:54:51] <@SoFarFetched> Don't be shits chat.
[1:54:53] <Badgerconda_> I was joking, because obviously it wouldn't be Woolie

[1:55:02] <Ball_Bag_Goblin> Chat being so rude
[1:55:04] <%Puhff> LUL
[1:55:07] <%lumporr> red flags exist
[1:55:10] <DaKnightWarrior> yep
[1:55:10] <auraoftheearth009> I would understand if it was a dog that had a history with trauma, but then I wouldn't let them near people who didn't understand how to handle a traumatized animal
[1:55:10] <Badgerconda_> I was making a joke in line with the 'Woolie killed a guy' meme
[1:55:11] <mar_krow> Don’t be rude chat
[1:55:11] <+NopeBadguy> I keep forgetting james small is a real fucking person and not a bit
[1:55:12] <%Lion_kun> Woolie's dog died to rats.
[1:55:12] <Torgue_1> zekeCH zekeAD , you stop that
[1:55:13] <%mike2hands> wolie is a sweet man
[1:55:14] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Come on you guys, you know Woolie hates animals
[1:55:14] <%Broand> Is it (someone we're overthinking)
[1:55:14] <Yung_FckUp> "fuck them kids" - Woolie
[1:55:15] <wasdsf> he DID kill that guy though but that was cool
[1:55:15] <deviljhojho_> their FILTH
[1:55:16] <mattmmkay> rumours are never good
[1:55:18] <revoltingimp> Big Truth
[1:55:18] <pokefan9956> so is this game good?
[1:55:18] <%DianaTheAscian> its prob some guy from highschool chat
[1:55:19] <@SoFarFetched> Its more its insulting to make a joke about woolie like that.
[1:55:20] <Ball_Bag_Goblin> They get their dirt on you then you end up showering three times a day
[1:55:21] <heartlesshealer> also woolie defended a dog from spiders in grenada, how dare you think he would be dirtbag with dogs
[1:55:21] <%krispen_wa> Pat sent his dog to eat a 10 year old?
[1:55:23] <%valriot> Woolie (FINAL)
[1:55:23] <leinadtonu> or their bags
[1:55:25] <+oktavia_von> @captain_thickthighs still love doggies
[1:55:26] <%Lion_kun> In Grenada, it's not a joke.
[1:55:27] <%Valdorick> Come on guys, Woolie isn't a shit, he only stole your pie you were keeping int he fridge.
[1:55:30] <%BoxNavy> i dont know woolie personally but he seems waaaaay to upstanding to be that type of dude
[1:55:33] <LeeOhX> Chat acting like those bullys from 5 mins ago rn
[1:55:37] <Tuna_Can_0> woolies good boy <3
[1:55:37] <%JoshManVGH> Some people are just shit, and this is an example of how quickly you can figure it out!
[1:55:40] <cherrycottontail> woolie comes from the trash pit, not the dirt pit
[1:55:41] <pokefan9956> so its good. got it
[1:55:42] <mattmmkay> you can feel it welling up inside you?
[1:55:42] <HomebaseRED> So teachers should get one, but dogs get none
[1:55:42] <deviljhojho_> misserable + empathy = misempathy
[1:55:44] <Ball_Bag_Goblin> So it's "Devious"?
[1:55:46] <%coward_man> I'm getting the damage in the shoulders too
[1:55:46] <leinadtonu> boob damage?
[1:55:47] <+Gamblitz> @PatStaresAt  back in the day, did you ever try join woolie and da boys in game QA?
[1:55:48] <Badgerconda_> +10 emotional damage
[1:55:48] <%goose_attack_almanac> Minesweeper is a good analogy for interacting with dirtbags
[1:55:49] <%BoxNavy> this game is thoughtprovoking thats for sure

[1:55:52] <reonome> @heartlesshealer it was rats
[1:55:52] <Zeif00> It's aight
[1:55:53] <%DianaTheAscian> this game hurts
[1:55:54] <iceballstwitch> Woolie will literally spend an hour trying to not offend people on the internet with his opinions. pretty obvious he wouldn't shrug off real life violence
[1:55:54] <%KineticZen> It's weird because it seemed really trite from the trailers we saw
[1:55:54] <$Garthunox> Its sparked some interesting conversations tho

[1:56:05] <mar_krow> I feel that

[1:56:26] <deviljhojho_> D:

[1:57:16] <worldbrand> @olaksi that's the exact issue i take with a lot of media that i've never been able to put my finger on, it's all pinned on trauma that feels centralized and fabricated and melodramatic

[2:21:04] <%krispen_wa> THIS CHAT DESPERATELY NEEDS THERAPY
[2:21:04] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Try being named after them
[2:21:05] <%Nested_Dreams> GOOD FOR YOU, I have to deal :(
[2:21:06] <+threamstream> Look at mister high society over here with both parents who love him
[2:21:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> It'd be cool if they covered intrusive thoughts. Have like sharp burs sticking to your clothes and stuff
[2:21:08] <%AncelDeLambert> Don't lie, Pat, we all know about your brother
[2:21:09] <KahnWick> Is this one of those "Artsy" games where the core message boils down to "people suck/are bad"
[2:21:09] <+RowenCleric> I heard Pat's bro is a cool guy
[2:21:10] <turtlegryphon> Goku over here charging the spirit bomb to fire the laser

[2:21:27] <Rojahh> me and my dad were fine, Nathan Explosion
[2:21:28] <+Byronic_dreamer> I bounced off this game 'cause it hit a little too close to home. I was like mmmmmmm.... back to monhun with me
[2:21:30] <LeeOhX> I wonder who the fish is
[2:21:31] <BerryliciousDefinition> The psychic damage...
[2:21:38] <deviljhojho_> that animation

[2:21:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> I liked when it had  shell

[2:21:46] <@SoFarFetched> that mouth didnt seem to animate correctly
[2:21:48] <Saltmeisterr> ok that was a little funny
[2:21:50] <%Mrbaconator> maybe they should have thought of that before fucking condomless
[2:21:50] <Fabpsi_> so this "helping others out"-stuff is not really working out
[2:21:54] <BerryliciousDefinition> Knowing you were an unwanted baby is the worst
[2:21:58] <deviljhojho_> hmmmm i wonder
[2:21:58] <%krispen_wa> Yeah that looked real bad

[2:25:20] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I'd be totally down w/ these guys stepping back into a publishing role
[2:25:21] <@SoFarFetched> yeah cause the game is like 3-4 hours long.
[2:25:24] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I legit feel sad.
[2:25:25] <@SoFarFetched> think 4 hours if you wanna collect everything.
[2:25:34] <Saltmeisterr> all other versions are published by EA

[2:41:47] <commanderapathy> anthem was garbage anyway
[2:41:50] <%W1nterTitan> Did anyone??
[2:41:53] <%bapposbungers> Godfall is horrendous..

[2:41:56] <DEETRz> itll be free in 3 months
[2:41:58] <aeneous222> !Sos

[2:42:11] <Dante_Namikaze1> godfather is so bad it had less content than Avengers did on day one
[2:42:11] <+Gamblitz> ZZ Gundam is NOT Trash

[2:42:13] <%MisterRockett> You criticize games a lot
[2:42:13] <mike2hands> KIND OF
[2:42:14] <%lumporr> anthem reminded me of for my final compsci project, i was supposed to make a server, but i just faked it and presented the client spoofing a server and the teacher bought it
[2:42:14] <%Ranryu692> the latter
[2:42:14] <olaksi> not really
[2:42:15] <%asgard147> maybe?

[2:42:24] <%Broken_Sonex> No one really is
[2:42:24] <olaksi> the bar is pretty low though
[2:42:27] <vVAstrAVv> i mean ANYONES a critic
[2:42:31] <Sunstalker> You're a videogame jump mechanic critic
[2:42:37] <%lumporr> you're a critic by frequency
[2:42:38] <%wibbwobbler> u definitely can if u want
[2:42:40] <+Gamblitz> Hobbie I'm hit
[2:42:41] <+geminitengu> Go play Loop Hero you sham
[2:42:44] <AmuserName> I wouldn't have played GOTY 13 Sentinels if I hadn't gotten exposed to it through your streams.
[2:42:46] <heartlesshealer> reliably consistent taste
[2:42:49] <FstSergeant8595> Where are your 5 hour long Jacob Geller analysis videos Pat?
[2:42:50] <$Dakuu75> Kill Zone 2
[2:42:51] <commanderapathy> does everyone know why the game is called anthem?
[2:43:00] <%bapposbungers> Like Godfall?
[2:43:04] <%BubbaRands> Game pundit if you will
[2:43:05] <DaKnightWarrior> right
[2:43:06] <%baka_sugoi> you can smell it
[2:43:07] <$vehementvadr> isn't there another aliens thing happening?
[2:43:08] <iceballstwitch> like the avengers game was easy to judge
[2:43:11] <%cvp5127> like avengers
[2:43:17] <%Broken_Sonex> Anthem looked......SO generic.
[2:43:18] <%ssjklyco> I remember that
[2:43:19] <Tracazoid> What do you mean Pat Marvel vs Capcom Infinite's going to be the shit
[2:43:20] <%Lion_kun> Matt who?
[2:43:20] <%Broand> Dude if you can do that with things that aren't videogames then your creativity problem will evaporate
[2:43:20] <Rojahh> So when's the aliens fireteam stream with peach and plague?
[2:43:22] <%ChrisPlaysThing> You can taste the virtual lies
[2:43:24] <AmuserName> LUL
[2:43:25] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL
[2:43:25] <+geminitengu> @commanderapathy  because their original name was bad and they jsut picked  a random name from the actualy game
[2:43:26] <%bapposbungers> @baka_sugoi Smell it? I could taste it.
[2:43:27] <%lumporr> i wanted to believe
[2:43:32] <%asgard147> and it was!
[2:43:33] <%ssjklyco> It was so fake, it had the wrong prompts
[2:43:36] <+Jiggisnipe> Woolie wanted to believe deep in his heart
[2:43:37] <%Arkfyre> woolie saw jetpacks and flying and was sold
[2:43:37] <Marsaline> Anthem had literally no soul from the get-go
[2:43:38] <PinoProxie> woolie the optimist
[2:43:39] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Movies are the same for me. I can spot a "everything good about this movie is in this trailer" trailer from a mile away.
[2:43:44] <%AyotoCorp> Anthem had Jetpacks, of course Woolie would fall for it
[2:43:45] <%lumporr> they did a hard grift
[2:43:45] <worldbrand> there were a few times i was SUPER wrong with thinking something was going to be bad
[2:43:47] <%Pappajimbo> wolie is our eternal hope
[2:43:49] <%Broken_Sonex> They were being SMART about
[2:43:49] <Sunstalker> It's mechs, Woolie's boner took the blood from his brain
[2:43:54] <+bapposbungers> OMG
[2:43:55] <%DakotaMacDoodle> He saw the Iron man flying and wanted to believe
[2:43:56] <%wibbwobbler> actual lies
[2:43:57] <+ThomasOfTroy> Stealth was bad
[2:43:59] <%cvp5127> yes
[2:44:00] <%notoriousvt_> I was a child and I LOVED Stealth
[2:44:02] <%BigDumBeak> @patstaresat what was the MOST fake trailer youve ever seen that probably made you laugh?
[2:44:03] <Dante_Namikaze1> fuck jo
[2:44:04] <%Dementedpenguin> I still remember when the Skyrim reveal trailer that showed NOTHING, but people still said "The graphics look amazing!"
[2:44:04] <%BoxNavy> no
[2:44:05] <%valriot> THAT MOVIE SUCKS
[2:44:06] <Dante_Namikaze1> *no

[2:44:07] <heartlesshealer> ?????
[2:44:08] <%Alazull> I do remember it
[2:44:10] <A0N33> Oh I REMEMBER THAT TRAILER
[2:44:10] <%barrakuta371> Didnt you see pop in in the trailer and said "This is real, I saw pop in"
[2:44:10] <commanderapathy> @geminitengu actually because the mgguffin in the game is called the anthem
[2:44:10] <+Gamblitz> Ace combat 7
[2:44:12] <%Alazull> And it was garbage
[2:44:13] <%bapposbungers> AI Robot Plane must be destroyed
[2:44:13] <%ssjklyco> It succeded in being what it title said
[2:44:14] <%Agami23> pat, i need to be real with you.
[2:44:16] <%cvp5127> i had it on psp
[2:44:16] <Midnight188> as garbage as the one about a killer tire?
[2:44:18] <TurtlesAndTentacles> That movie had Jamie FOxx in it
[2:44:19] <%lumporr> "what is... love?" -stealth bomber
[2:44:20] <heartlesshealer> I SAW 4 MINUTES OF THAT
[2:44:20] <%Agami23> that is the plot to the new sword art online
[2:44:22] <%BoxNavy> that sounds like shit
[2:44:23] <Brisk83> There is a good game somewhere in Cyber punk, we just aint found it yet.
[2:44:26] <Tracazoid> That sounds horrible, so is it at least slightly entertaining garbage
[2:44:27] <%JD_Lars> Jaime Fox’s movie. It’s bad
[2:44:31] <%solracc25> Who?
[2:44:35] <%notoriousvt_> The jetplane played buttrock when it was a petulant teenager it was rad
[2:44:37] <%JD_Lars> Battleship was similar garbage
[2:44:40] <pokefan9956> new pokemon
[2:44:42] <+Gamblitz> Pokemon legends
[2:44:45] <vVAstrAVv> sounds like a movie that should be 5 minutes long lol
[2:44:45] <%Agami23> i am not lying. for real. that is the villains plans for the sword art online and has been for a while
[2:44:46] <CalusRaccoon> my dad LOVES Stealth and rib him every time I catch him watching that fucking movie
[2:44:47] <%ConLin_Arts_> what about the Sun Wukong game?
[2:44:50] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[2:44:58] <+geminitengu> @commanderapathy they had a name before release that EA didnt like so they named it the maguffin i was just being lazy
[2:45:01] <pokefan9956> I've had a ton of friends who think its gonna be fine in a year
[2:45:02] <Profmcstevie> You put your best foot forward in a trailer or I WILL DESTROY YOU WITH LAUGHTER
[2:45:04] <%BoxNavy> @ConLin_Arts_ thats the fakest shit in the world dude
[2:45:07] <pokefan9956> its not gonna be fine in a year
[2:45:08] <sendart> it'll be even worse on releaes
[2:45:08] <FstSergeant8595> Switch just has horrible fps in general, so naw thats not changging
[2:45:08] <%bapposbungers> I love woolies optimism.
[2:45:09] <DracaenaLeaf> Kappa

[2:45:11] <vVAstrAVv> bokomon
[2:45:11] <revoltingimp> The Sun Wukong game is fucking fake
[2:45:14] <Blank9> GOOD graphics
[2:45:16] <Tracazoid> X and Y's framerate couldn't even keep itself alive in some battles
[2:45:18] <+Jiggisnipe> @ConLin_Arts_ I still think that's fake
[2:45:18] <%lumporr> pokemon should've stayed in my childhood
[2:45:20] <%TheFramedWarlock> They will not
[2:45:22] <Retolee> People thought that Sword and Shield would improve for release too
[2:45:27] <%ConLin_Arts_> same here
[2:45:28] <+1412magus> 1412magus subscribed with Prime. 
[2:45:29] <cherrycottontail> The developer is Gamefreak so it will suck
[2:45:34] <commanderapathy> @geminitengu ah, it's still the dumbest shit ever
[2:45:39] <%ConLin_Arts_> that is why I wonder, because that trailer had framedrops
[2:45:39] <Mrmcrolan> Or you can do what Bioware is doing rn, Announce HD re-release of ME1 and show ONLY fottage of reshaded ME2 and ME3,,,
[2:45:49] <%lumporr> it's not the morning
[2:45:49] <%BubbaRands> please

[2:46:04] <%Broken_Sonex> @revoltingimp It ain't real, it never existed. What even is a Sun Wukong game?
