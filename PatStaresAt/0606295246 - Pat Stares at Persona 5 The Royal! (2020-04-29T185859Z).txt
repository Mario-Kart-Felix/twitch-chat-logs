[0:05:09] <baronvonbirman> !uptime
[0:05:09] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5m 11s.
[0:05:10] <%NitronStreams> i have literally never cared about assassins creed. the only ac game i was interested in was that spin off skull and bones game that seems like will never come out
[0:05:19] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> FF12 was real fun, basically Japanese KOTOR
[0:05:21] <Jeemukun> question is, what time period would it be, 1066? Lindisfarne, the danelaw and king canute?
[0:05:34] <%Ipsenscastle> God I can't take any more Dokapon Kingdom
[0:05:36] <%Dakuu75> I kind of dropped off on Assassin's creed when it become a crazy loot-goblin mode

[0:06:27] <%YakumoYomi> I only played AC2, partly because I got caught up in the hype of Revelations. It was alright, but I didn't play any of the others.
[0:06:28] <%Ipsenscastle> @Jeemukun 1066 was Normans, not Vikings
[0:07:06] <Jeemukun> @Ipsenscastle true, though the normans were orginally vikings, but looking at that twitter stream it is probably older then 1066

[0:12:32] <%nofestu2> why do people keep putting your hair in their ass?
[0:12:35] <zenorot> The vikings tried to settle in America but thr settle just didn't last. The distance was probably to far to really populate
[0:12:36] <%CanadianAnimatorGuy> It gets in the laundry
[0:12:37] <%Dakuu75> long hair is sentient
[0:12:43] <+AbnormalVoid> I find my own hairs in my ass all the time

[1:06:25] <WeltSchulter> dumbass <3
[1:06:27] <%Aydarkzero> She is a Maze
[1:06:30] <ItamarZel> Kawakami is corn
[1:06:30] <%D00msDayDan> it's a big maze
[1:06:32] <Fujiwara_92> NAH, SHE'S A SEX WORKER
[1:06:32] <ShichiNoBushi> "But that's the best part."
[1:06:33] <%psychodave1234> she absolutely whored herself out and its quite sad
[1:06:35] <appletumtum> She's a maze
[1:06:35] <akman14> She corn?
[1:06:38] <iwa5h4ck3d> Shes totally a sex worker
[1:06:38] <%valriot> She literally says "S E R V I C E S"
[1:06:40] <%Valdorick> "Bobby orders a hooker, but uses her to clean his cloths"
[1:06:42] <mattdaddyd365> Just in time for the sex porn
[1:06:46] <%tigerfang86> TOTALLY A SEX THING
[1:06:56] <%hawk_rush> she's a sex worker
[1:06:56] <ManfredA> pat you're super wrong
[1:06:57] <%chill_o_wisp> it's an option
[1:06:58] <%hawk_rush> they mention it
[1:06:59] <%NitronStreams> HEAVY PETTING
[1:07:00] <%spiritofmojave> it super is atleast some sort of escort service
[1:07:00] <%cvp5127> handholding
[1:07:01] <%CappuccinoGuil> It's a voyeuristic thing, I think
[1:07:02] <%Valdorick> She's a maid, in that she cleans, THE SMEGMA FROM YOUR DICK AFTER SEX WITH HER
[1:07:03] <%valriot> She sucky the pp, teacher milkers Kreygasm
[1:07:03] <%reonome> mmm head petting
[1:07:06] <%zanzibar_junker> Still under the umbrella of one
[1:07:07] <%GohanHitsugaya> But who cares?
[1:07:08] <zenorot> She provides a service
[1:07:08] <brizzlewa> In Japan, there are levels of a sex-worker.
[1:07:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> @cvp5127 you degenerate
[1:07:10] <Hellarussian> is rad
[1:07:10] <RDknight> big crimes
[1:07:10] <%cureneckbeard> headpats
[1:07:12] <+griffball13> not in japan
[1:07:12] <%psychodave1234> @ManfredA hes entirely right tho
[1:07:13] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Kawakami is literally the best confidant other than Kasumi. Those 2 are objectively the best girls.
[1:07:13] <%Arxel1> And the company DOES have both a maid division and a '''maid''' division
[1:07:13] <%j0ustar> [ PETTING INTENSIFIES ]
[1:07:14] <%42nfl19> "I'm a teacher, and you're my student" "THAT'S THE BEST PART"
[1:07:16] <MSN04_Sazabi> You mean the translation defines her as a sex-worker Kappa
[1:07:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> Headpatting and handholding? Chat is lost
[1:07:21] <+Fenris_Alexius> No she doesn't she just mentions that it's inappropriate and there's also a "Sister company" which is implied to be straight up prostitution @PatStaresAt
[1:07:21] <ManfredA> no
[1:07:25] <%zanzibar_junker> yes
[1:07:28] <Hellarussian> oh no
[1:07:28] <%AllenDeadman> yes there is
[1:07:29] <%spiritofmojave> correct
[1:07:34] <ManfredA> someone else describes her as a sex worker and they say they're only guessing
[1:07:34] <%ImmaCanuck> If they get enough levels do they evolve? Kappa
[1:07:35] <%cvp5127> raise your whore level
[1:07:37] <TheFranss> Damn that was fast 20 mins
[1:07:41] <ManfredA> it's entirely put upon her
[1:07:43] <sendart> Im a level 2 Cock Wizard
[1:07:48] <ShinMaddrox> Ah yeah. betty time.

[1:07:55] <%hawk_rush> yep, you're right
[1:07:56] <zenorot> Still wierd tho
[1:07:57] <ThatGuyNamedEdd> that doesn't sound right
[1:07:57] <%redlanternreviews> Oh yeah the parents call her a Sex Worker
[1:07:58] <ItamarZel> Why couldn't I date Mr Morooka :(
[1:07:58] <mastertwin2> "moonlight as a sex worker"
[1:08:00] <nikoloas_> yeah but you're probably wrong tho
[1:08:01] <%starotter70> It does show up
[1:08:03] <%psychodave1234> thats how he always looks
[1:08:03] <%Meekest> He's gonna take a bat to her
[1:08:03] <%frunkAF> The parents say the word "sex worker"
[1:08:04] <%televisedrevolting> Someone, check if Patrick is wrong.
[1:08:05] <%hawk_rush> they literally say it
[1:08:06] <%logoth_> What does Ryujis shirt say? FAF?
[1:08:07] <%Aydarkzero> he looks like he's seen some shit
[1:08:11] <%NickCaesar7> they do say sex worker
[1:08:11] <alphonseisbest> PAT Why would u trust ur self?!
[1:08:13] <+SpaceHobo55> @Fenris_Alexius No the couple straight up say they will tell the school that she is a sex worker and she is like "how did you know?"
[1:08:16] <ManfredA> As I said, the culprits of her confidant call her one and have nothing to back it up, it was a pure guess
[1:08:17] <MSN04_Sazabi> THAT'S NOT SELF-DEFINING PAT
[1:08:23] <ItamarZel> Maid Mr Morooka
[1:08:23] <%tigerfang86> OH NO ITS THE SEX MUSIC

[1:17:24] <%televisedrevolting> Joker totally wears lifts in his shoes to establish a form of domestic dominance.
[1:17:25] <%TheMattman1313> What's hilarious is I don't know if Ryuji knew about the scope of the "other" services.

[1:19:26] <%hawk_rush> I don't remember that
[1:19:27] <WanderingSwordsman> his rank 7 is too good
[1:19:27] <brizzlewa> You need to wait for an invitation.
[1:19:27] <%Hegelundra> WHAT WHAT?
[1:19:28] <%logoth_> F
[1:19:28] <%zanzibar_junker> a lot of the sex workers in Japan who visit places usually have a silent alarm and someone to bust the door and kill you if you decide to hurt them.
[1:19:28] <+Rickets89> but maybe it is
[1:19:30] <$mrhappy6677> @PatStaresAt No I think they changed that. It's Wednesdays and Fridays in Royal.
[1:19:31] <%shiny_prinny> FOR REAL?
[1:19:31] <%DrFacilier> i dont think so
[1:19:31] <%redlanternreviews> A literal in game month

[1:19:42] <%Meekest> I don't think thats right
[1:19:43] <%televisedrevolting> Just wait for the invitation, Patrick
[1:19:43] <+Talbz> Its so you can't get his evolved Persona too early
[1:19:44] <%hawk_rush> just look it up, pat!
[1:19:44] <%nictron90> I am at least glad they made his rank 7 not actively detrimental now
[1:19:49] <iwa5h4ck3d> You gotta fiinsh the 3rd palace
[1:19:53] <%bread_assassin> Ryuji Rank 7 is a special event.
[1:19:55] <jeffthesequel> No but it is in June.
[1:19:56] <+Fenris_Alexius> that appears to be accurate
[1:19:56] <Huntercd> That one chick from Blazblue was all about cat dick Ann might be too
[1:19:58] <%ScreamLord> Raccoons can squeeze their bodies into an opening as small as 10 cm in diameter. The Human anus can stretch as wide as 12cm

[1:20:22] <Huntercd> Ms. Chouno is a sexy bitch
[1:20:23] <$mrhappy6677> They changed this in Royal according to a guide I read. It's on Wednesday and Friday nights now in Royal.

[1:22:39] <%kyh9> Getting Dommed by a toddler
[1:22:49] <ItamarZel> This is so weird to me that you're minmaxing this much
[1:22:51] <iwa5h4ck3d> You can have sex with Ryuji soon
[1:22:55] <+Fenris_Alexius> ok but counterpoint: Ryuji's second awakening is radical
[1:23:01] <PortableBoredom> when can we date the lolis
[1:23:03] <+PapaGravestone> hey ga
[1:23:05] <%bevyrage> most-maxing

[1:23:07] <%Movemeister> Anyone know if Pat new game plussed Persona 5 vanilla?
[1:23:11] <%Totally_not_toby> this is just how you play the game
[1:23:11] <+PapaGravestone> guys **
[1:23:12] <+Kduff89> @ItamarZel its like you have never watched pat play a game
[1:23:16] <%Pigg1yJuffs> You're too late for Ryuji, the date you needed to hang out with him was on the 25th. @patstaresat
[1:23:17] <ManfredA> ahhh instakill
[1:23:21] <zenorot> Do It, let that debachery flow from you and join the dark side
[1:23:31] <+fgcmorad> Rank 7 Ryuji is top 3 confidant perks in the game for sure
[1:23:39] <%Dr00_PhD> LUL
[1:23:39] <%bread_assassin> Ryuji's insta-kill is stupid good.
[1:23:39] <+Kduff89> F
[1:23:39] <ManfredA> it's literally right here
[1:23:39] <%starotter70> 5/27 is a date you can hang

[1:23:53] <iwa5h4ck3d> You dont really need instakill this early into the game anyway
[1:23:55] <Jack_DT> I'd rather romance Yusuke
[1:24:05] <asurite_warrior> this game seems almost esoteric in it's bond paths
[1:24:05] <ManfredA> Yusuke is best boy
[1:24:06] <StebTheVee> So you can just get any Persona that corresponds the Confidant no matter the level of that Persona?
[1:24:11] <%Movemeister> @Rickets89 That's the way
[1:24:12] <zenorot> Yusuke only likes 2D
[1:24:12] <+Fenris_Alexius> yes
[1:24:15] <%hzealot> instakill in mementos is hilarious
[1:24:18] <ItamarZel> bruh, Rank 10 Ryuji before June?

[1:24:52] <Hellarussian> jeez guy
[1:24:57] <$mrhappy6677> I meant what I said about the rank 7 being changed slightly.

[1:25:10] <%bevyrage> though you'd wanna say it as 'yamachi' since the 'u' is short
[1:25:11] <ManfredA> or maybe not, someone else said you can get him after Kaneshiro
[1:25:15] <$mrhappy6677> I would post the guide I used, but no links here.

[1:26:31] <zenorot> Shujin is just a school that collects scumbags
[1:26:32] <+PapaGravestone> wait teachers get one until the job is done though. this is legal
[1:26:35] <kiwicoffin> Let's be corrupt! For the future of Japan!

[1:26:48] <%starotter70> @Pigg1yJuffs 5/25 is another date you can hang out with them
[1:26:55] <%dekkitout> @PapaGravestone Yeah, but it has to be all physical, no proxies Kappa
[1:26:59] <Yukai_Yami> The anger towards those shitty adults gives Ryuji the POWER OF INSTAKILL

[1:34:21] <%spiritofmojave> TRUE
[1:34:22] <%Ipsenscastle> Truly an inspiration
[1:34:22] <%j0ustar> They are confidence incarnate
[1:34:23] <%BoomerUnchained> They're the Vegeta of pokemon
[1:34:23] <NeonBleu> decades

[1:34:31] <+Remery_> Jessie is super hot tho
[1:34:33] <%spiritofmojave> that's a phrase
[1:34:34] <%BubbaRands> They got him a few times
[1:34:34] <%Robot_Nixon_> awh FeelsBadMan
[1:34:34] <+fingalights> Is that an expression?
[1:34:36] <+PapaGravestone> i
[1:34:38] <%Ynkubus18> Giovanni pays them to keep them out of the way now
[1:34:40] <%dekkitout> It's an idiom, you see
[1:34:40] <appletumtum> I mean, James must have to confidently wear all those dresses and female roles
[1:34:42] <brizzlewa> I agree with Paige.
[1:34:43] <%nofestu2> they got that hussle
[1:34:45] <zenorot> Plus she's a model Ann wouldn't be an outcast she'd be a popular kid in class
[1:34:46] <ShinMaddrox> Different way of saying Screwing the pooch
[1:34:47] <ManfredA> Meowth's true calling was as a ramen chef
[1:34:47] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> James is a gay icon
[1:34:47] <%Dragovus> PLAN GUN
[1:34:48] <%starotter70> @PatStaresAt Remember when Jessie and James fucked in the manga and had a kid?
[1:34:49] <%toastybites> "We slack off so we can keep our jobs"
[1:34:49] <Yukai_Yami> Less than a year since Ash is still 10...
[1:34:49] <%YakumoYomi> "Fellated the doggo"
[1:34:50] <%zeif00> If they chose any other career they'd be wildly successful, but they love it.
[1:34:51] <ItamarZel> just shoot everyone else with a gun
[1:34:53] <%RealThiele> pikachu is an ASSHOLe on tv
[1:34:58] <%Meekest> They've done that
[1:34:59] <+fgcmorad> PokPikachu
[1:34:59] <%weissguard> It's even better recently. They try, only to accept the fact that they fail. They even help out the heroes when circumstances allow.
[1:35:00] <+fingalights> I swear they did that
[1:35:02] <%BubbaRands> Just a reminder that Jessie and James are 16
[1:35:03] <%walternatorz> I feel like they've done that
[1:35:04] <%cvp5127> or use a gun
[1:35:07] <%worldbrand> I am almost sure that has happened
[1:35:08] <%sjay449> sjay449 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 16 month streak! Thoughts on Assassins Creed being in Viking times?
[1:35:08] <%Movemeister> They've done that
[1:35:08] <%CappuccinoGuil> Jesse & James have never captured a pokemon. Their whole team always joins them of their own will.
[1:35:10] <%dekkitout> That's happened like 4 times
[1:35:11] <%Joestar1890> Just throw some dirt at Pikachu
[1:35:12] <%AllenDeadman> pretty sure they've done that ,multiple times
[1:35:12] <%indig0bird> The content I'm here for
[1:35:14] <%weissguard> Bewear is the BEST addition to Team Rocket's dynamic.
[1:35:14] <Mrbaconator> BANG BIGGITY BANG
[1:35:17] <%TheMattman1313> They try that all the time. Inevitably they start fighting and fuck it uyp
[1:35:19] <StebTheVee> 20 years capturing a 10-year-old's animal.
[1:35:20] <%Meekest> That's nice Paige
[1:35:23] <%RealThiele> James has HUGE titties
[1:35:23] <ItamarZel> what the fuck is going on
[1:35:25] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Hell yeah
[1:35:25] <%applefibs> That's nice Paige
[1:35:25] <appletumtum> @CappuccinoGuil Jessie stole a Yamna tho
[1:35:28] <%Ascethetic> They wanted Pikachu cuz its only a 5% spawn in Veridion Forest
[1:35:29] <Gallhint> wouldnt it be funny if criminals hit animals -- paige
[1:35:30] <%Movemeister> Remember that time team rocket we're going to shoot Ash?
[1:35:30] <%hawk_rush> i love bewear
[1:35:31] <%bevyrage> they've done that three times throughout the series, but they never punched pikachu in the face. they HAVE SHOT BOTH ASH AND PIKACHU THOUGH
[1:35:31] <%Copperama> well anyways
[1:35:31] <+DorianCreed> Swiggity swag GET IN THE BAG
[1:35:32] <%j0ustar> what a great conversation
[1:35:32] <%spiritofmojave> verrrry cool Paige
[1:35:32] <%dekkitout> "Produced by Zach Snyder"
[1:35:34] <%Robot_Nixon_> Remember that one time Jesse clearly beat Ash and was about to win, but the writers said no
[1:35:38] <%Strider222> yes
[1:35:42] <%worldbrand> they got married at the end of the manga and it's the sweetest thing ever
[1:35:43] <zenorot> Team Rocket should just wait for Ash to fall asleep n murder him
[1:35:49] <%Copperama> I'm pretending this is the conversation Joker and Ann are having
[1:35:51] <%weissguard> It just scoops them and LEAVES.
[1:35:54] <%BubbaRands> What if James was an amputee? 4Head
[1:35:57] <brizzlewa> Watch the re:View, not the movie.
[1:35:57] <+MeatClackin> They just need to have James dress up in a bikini again, there is no next step.
[1:35:58] <+AbnormalVoid> I love that movie
[1:35:58] <NiktenKing> LUL

[1:36:05] <+fingalights> Why watch thing when you can listen to people talk about it
[1:36:06] <%indig0bird> Jessie's mother was a Rocket operative and grew up in poverty and James was a rich brat escaping an arranged married
[1:36:07] <%worldbrand> @Copperama you just improved this LP for me by like 63%
[1:36:10] <M4T1A5> If Ann isn't finnish then why does she have a Finnish surname if you write it correctly(Takamäki)?

[1:37:24] <MildMannered> I just got here...interesting conversation to come to
[1:37:27] <%satans_finest_millennial> saw a thing on it
[1:37:28] <%Joestar1890> THAT CHILD IS DEAD. DECEASED
[1:37:32] <ItamarZel> This movie is nowhere near as funny as how it was just described
[1:37:33] <%starotter70> He got transported to another dimension
[1:37:36] <%televisedrevolting> Glad I didn't start my final yet.
[1:37:36] <+Fenris_Alexius> I mean,,,
[1:37:38] <%Ancopro> learn japanese from those animes
[1:37:39] <+fingalights> ALL Anime

[1:37:40] <Yukai_Yami> What the hell??
[1:37:41] <%Dragovus> HE'S OK! I CAN SEE HIS PARACHUTE!

[1:37:57] <ItamarZel> Ann doesn't understand sarcasm
[1:38:05] <+ostangential> when is paige playing outer wilds
[1:38:06] <TheFranss> MOTIVATION UP
[1:38:07] <%42nfl19> They have an anime for everything, acting, cooking, sports, making manga, teaching , ETC
[1:38:10] <%j0ustar> Even Joker went "That wasn't....nevermind"
[1:38:10] <%YakumoYomi> That girl ain't right...
[1:38:14] <+Fenris_Alexius> Oh hey the best skill in the game
[1:38:14] <@SoFarFetched> "sexy technique"
[1:38:19] <+ZipperHands> Just like a white girl, Ann can't understand sarcassm
[1:38:23] <%Valdorick> Remember that Tales of the Abyss is rated T for T, and shows, with no censoring, a small child on a rock falling into the liquid mantel of the earth, shaking his dad's corpse going "wake up wake up" before he SCREAM IN PAIN as he gets devoured by the liquid earth.
[1:38:23] <jbrowning134> Do you prefer this or P4G?
[1:38:27] <ItamarZel> The P5 gang is low IQ
[1:38:28] <zenorot> But Ann has no talent other than her looks. She incredibly shallow
[1:38:29] <%TheMattman1313> She's gonna hook up with Touma
[1:38:31] <%Aydarkzero> YEP

[1:39:05] <%CappuccinoGuil> Ann gets ripped
[1:39:07] <ItamarZel> I feel like at least 10% of this chat was Futaba
[1:39:11] <%RealThiele> ive repressed most of mine so HAH
[1:39:14] <%NitronStreams> i swear you are not a complete person until like 25
[1:39:14] <%sjay449> Ryuji is my favorite "bro" character of P3-P5
[1:39:18] <%YakumoYomi> @Valdorick I forgot about that shit.
[1:39:22] <%televisedrevolting> As the resident "Bout' to be in College", I am pretty fucking stupid.

[1:56:38] <+bear_breaker20> himbo/bimbo rights
[1:56:41] <%BubbaRands> spell check is important cologne
[1:56:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> remember when Pat used to pretend he wasn't going to bust a dump
[1:56:43] <@SoFarFetched> colon and cologne are very important differences.

[1:59:57] <ShichiNoBushi> Look at that JPEG.
[2:00:08] <%j0ustar> @dekkitout people need to understand the differences already. Oddly enough they're and their don't get confused as much in news columns but I have seen Affect instead of effect and just go "YOU'RE A JOURNALIST YOU HAVE ONE JOB."
[2:00:09] <%hawk_rush> it's tourist central
[2:00:18] <Dest_121> mishima is such a loser holy shit
[2:00:18] <%Mr_Pylon> Look it's Kiryu
[2:00:27] <%UvBenServed> Smells like BITCH
[2:00:29] <ItamarZel> KANJI?!
[2:00:33] <%VioletHeart> Mishima's such a loser but I like him a lot.
[2:00:37] <@SoFarFetched> Are you sure he's not into Final Fantasy? LUL
[2:00:40] <%dekkitout> Or a cosplayer...
[2:00:40] <Auriel_Astrum> I hate Mishima's dumb shirt
[2:00:42] <%GohanHitsugaya> LUL
[2:00:44] <%BubbaRands> No just a final fantasy character
[2:00:49] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Just a final fantasy character
[2:00:51] <%starotter70> That's just Nomura
[2:00:52] <%Afterman_> hes got a kink
[2:00:53] <TheFranss> @Mr_Pylon *pulls out knife* WHERE?
[2:00:54] <ShichiNoBushi> Lot's of belts. It's probably just Nomura.
[2:00:55] <KaitlynnHere> ...l.
[2:00:59] <%logoth_> talk about riding coattails
[2:01:02] <KaitlynnHere> He’s goth
[2:01:12] <sendart> tingling in his pants over a hot goth dude
[2:01:19] <KaitlynnHere> Goth kids are usually super nice
[2:01:23] <%ALazo> Mishima hates goths
[2:01:26] <%valriot> "I cant be racist, im friends with a phantom thief" Mishima
[2:01:28] <%SpicyCheeseNips> EVER HEARD OF COSPLAY MISHIMA
[2:01:36] <wix964> "They all look like idiots!"
[2:01:38] <%mechslayer71> Mishima fucking sucks ass. I got one snippy ass response from him then literally never talked to him again.
[2:01:43] <%starotter70> @KaitlynnHere Ture, my friend is goth and she's the sweetest person I know
[2:01:50] <%dekkitout> Bobby just wants to put on a nice dress
[2:01:53] <ManfredA> it's a same Mishima's one of the most useful confidants
[2:01:54] <%CappuccinoGuil> PUT JOKER IN A DRESS
[2:01:55] <%GohanHitsugaya> We should have been able to date Mishima...
[2:01:57] <ManfredA> *shame
[2:01:58] <%Movemeister> Ryuji is super into this
[2:01:59] <%spiritofmojave> LIKE A CLOWN
[2:02:00] <%hawk_rush> JOKER WANTS A DRESS
[2:02:04] <%GohanHitsugaya> He cute
[2:02:05] <%Takreth> Mishima is a great ability stuck on a simp confidant
[2:02:07] <%indig0bird> "I wanna wear a cute dress." Joker, probably
[2:02:09] <Dest_121> if mishima didn't have good abilities no one would do his confidant
[2:02:10] <%toastybites> Give him a police uniform
[2:02:12] <ItamarZel> Joker loves dressing up
[2:02:16] <%Divryne> Mishima would totally do unsavory things to a school if P5 didn’t take place in Japan.
[2:02:20] <%mashinchaserr> psaBig psaDab
[2:02:23] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Pretty much Marilyn Manson
[2:02:24] <KaitlynnHere> Holy shit. Can we make him goth?!

[2:02:35] <%SaiyanShoto> Not the ones I knew
[2:02:35] <%dekkitout> They're a quite jubilant lot
[2:02:36] <%Rafferty3231> Pat is thinking of Emo
[2:02:36] <Dest_121> its just a clothing style Pat
[2:02:37] <%miguelrod777> it's what makes it hot
[2:02:38] <+azulezircon> They're super nice
[2:02:39] <+Remery_> my ex was a friendly goth

[2:02:49] <%wiley_boi> TRAP
[2:02:49] <%reonome> LUL
[2:02:49] <+ssjklyco> Goth: Lets be not comformist by conforming and dressing the same
[2:02:49] <%BubbaRands> Dark souls doesnt mean a dark personality
[2:02:50] <%CappuccinoGuil> THAT TRACKS, THOUGH
[2:02:50] <%valriot> Mishimas standing there like "I need to go home to my Resetera thread, and check out the Quarterings new video"
[2:02:50] <%Ascethetic> I was a goth kid in high school, my whole group was chill
[2:02:50] <%Kingjhon8> oh ahit
[2:02:50] <%Daniel_Is_I> Paige, your aesthetic is hooker boots.
[2:02:51] <ManfredA> contrast is powerful
[2:02:52] <TheFranss> Goths are hella CHILL
[2:02:52] <$zyberion626> The world sucks, but I don't have to
[2:02:52] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> You said it not Pat

[2:02:56] <%42nfl19> ITS A TRAP
[2:02:57] <@commanderclaw> Paige, that's all girly dress people
[2:02:59] <KaitlynnHere> Goths and punks are sweethearts
[2:03:00] <%starotter70> Isn't Paige's Aesthetic Grandma?
[2:03:02] <%42nfl19> DONT SAY ANYTHING PAT
[2:03:07] <KaitlynnHere> She is..
[2:03:07] <%logoth_> God damnit Mona
[2:03:07] <%j0ustar> Talk to a goth people. They are the nicest people you'll meet
[2:03:10] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Gurgle gurgle noise
[2:03:11] <@SoFarFetched> I thought Paige's aesthetic was Black and Blue cause she's always cruisn' for a bruisin'
[2:03:13] <%Agami23> its why pastel goth is a thing
[2:03:20] <%Joestar1890> No Mona, you're still a cat...
[2:03:20] <ItamarZel> Morgana, you are an ITEM
[2:03:21] <StebTheVee> It's why guys like goth girls. It's the closest we have to nice females.
[2:03:22] <%indig0bird> AAAAA FUCK MORGANA, STOP CALLING HER LADY ANN YOU SIMP
[2:03:26] <%YakumoYomi> @SoFarFetched psaSmug
[2:03:26] <%TheMattman1313> Wait can't Mishima not hear what Morgana is saying?
[2:03:31] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Pastel goth? I gotta look this up
[2:03:33] <missingangle> Nope. You are nothing more than an accessory, you friggin cat
[2:03:33] <%UvBenServed> Or a tiger
[2:03:33] <%Valdorick> Pussy gets Pussy, and dogs get you the god.
[2:03:34] <ManfredA> yes

[2:03:45] <%starotter70> True
[2:03:48] <KaitlynnHere> True
[2:03:49] <+Remery_> or a husky wolf mix
[2:03:50] <StebTheVee> Until that pup turns into a big dog
[2:03:58] <KaitlynnHere> I wanna walk around with my cat
[2:04:02] <KaitlynnHere> But she’s a pussy
[2:04:05] <%GohanHitsugaya> Having a cute Kitten AND a cute Puppy makes you even cuter!

[2:04:34] <%Mr_Pylon> get a Jack Russel and have ultimate cute buzzsaw forever
[2:04:39] <%Valdorick> All dogs are puppies sounds like the line right before someone else says "If it breeds, its a BIIIIIIIIITCH"
[2:04:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Okay St Bernards are dogs at some point but they act like puppies
[2:04:43] <%42nfl19> IF YOUR PUPPER BECOMES A HUGE FLOOFER

[2:47:04] <%Valdorick> Profiencincy is needed to not choke while eating, Knowledge helps you understand how best to eat the borgor
[2:47:06] <availablethor> You need Galaxy Brain to bend time and pace so your stomach becomes a tesseract and can contain the physical dimensions of the sandwich.

[2:51:54] <@SoFarFetched> New year,new hole.
[2:51:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> Frequent unination could be a sign of diabetes
[2:52:06] <%Ipsenscastle> I guess they needed the bidet because Pat's ass was so raw
[2:52:18] <KishinGrek> raw ass
[2:52:19] <%satans_finest_millennial> Naruto's Sakura is more useless than Bleach's Orihime. Thoughts?
[2:52:21] <Diablo169> It could also be a sign that he drank too much god damn coffee.
[2:52:28] <%Dakuu75> everyone could use a bidet
[2:52:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> y'all need to drink more water.
[2:52:28] <@SoFarFetched> he does drink a lot of water and coffee these days.
[2:52:31] <yourliteraldog> RAW ASS POUNDING
[2:52:31] <KishinGrek> orihime healed more ppk
[2:52:32] <+SlumberMan> @satans_finest_millennial Objectively true.

[2:52:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> @satans_finest_millennial Pre timeskip yeah after time skip she at least has super punch

[2:52:44] <delgm> @satans_finest_millennial Asqua
[2:52:46] <Dest_121> that is just true @satans_finest_millennial
[2:52:54] <%spiritofmojave> I think he needs a catheter so we have a more uninterrupted experience Kappa
[2:52:56] <%dekkitout> @satans_finest_millennial I have as much to say about that as their combined character development SeriousSloth
[2:53:11] <yourliteraldog> How about a bidet that also has an enema function
[2:53:14] <%weissguard> @dekkitout So nothing? Kappa
[2:53:18] <KishinGrek> Stands or Bankais?
[2:53:23] <@SoFarFetched> If you howl too hard,you turn into a pisswolf,much worse than a werewolf.

[3:21:53] <+Fenris_Alexius> Ryuji is the tank, he can take it
[3:21:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt a real friend would record the beating for future blackmale
[3:21:55] <+bear_breaker20> Ryuji is twitch chat
[3:21:56] <%nilla_24> hey you two should kiss

[3:22:01] <%starotter70> Oh yeah
[3:22:01] <%Totally_not_toby> I love Ryuji so much
[3:22:02] <%VioletHeart> You can max it SO early.

[3:22:04] <+PlagueOfGripes> deepen your bond with the black eyed cuck
[3:22:06] <%Daniel_Is_I> Best friends can always level fast

[3:22:15] <Dest_121> i got him to level 7 before madarame once
[3:22:19] <theangryguyofde> Ryuji gets his ass beat by everyone LUL
[3:22:22] <CastellanVon> You can get Ryuji and Ann so high it's great
[3:22:23] <jbrowning134> time for father son bonding
[3:22:26] <alwayspronking> He has no stat checks, is first, and only a time gate.
[3:22:30] <%Dakuu75> I thought someone said you couldn't rank him up again untill 6/28?
[3:22:30] <%taku_toots> Sore jaw huh
[3:22:30] <%j0ustar> ok masochist
[3:22:38] <%heartlesshealer> Ryuji's link is mostly "You don't have anything better to do, huh?"
[3:22:44] <Ash_Frey> is he following a guide ?
[3:22:46] <possumwalsh1221> I had him maxed by madarame maybe halfway thru it’s wild how fast his goes up
[3:22:49] <%Totally_not_toby> that might've been outdated info from vanilla, who knows
[3:22:56] <%linkster291> Like Ryuji can be just steamrolled.
[3:22:56] <+PlagueOfGripes> pollen warning?

[3:31:11] <%bread_assassin> Kaguya is broken in late game, too. Her unique skill just makes her a magic-based Yoshitsune.

[3:46:17] <+knowyourenemy_97> the more you know
[3:46:17] <SaltyAzteca> Its just wine tasting, what do you expect LUL
[3:46:17] <%Zebroneath> What was the name of the article?
[3:46:17] <nesbitt22> Why?
[3:46:18] <$zyberion626> sommeliers are the biggest liars
[3:46:18] <%delilah4you> No one knows what wine tastes like
[3:46:20] <%indig0bird> 100% true because some people actually prefer cheap, sweet wines
[3:46:20] <ShichiNoBushi> Tear of God lied to me!?
[3:46:20] <%worldbrand> sommelier more like sommeLIAR
[3:46:22] <BallerSwagBro9k> IM FROM FRANCE I CAN VOUCH
[3:46:23] <+Benzell> Mild Shock!
[3:46:23] <%zarbudda77> For real
[3:46:25] <TheFranss> Expensive wine DOESN'T MEAN SHIT
[3:46:26] <%YakumoYomi> @CappuccinoGuil Sounds like essentially what my guidance councillors were, so maybe it's just that the term is a regional thing.
[3:46:28] <+jjjkopf> and where it's from
[3:46:29] <%starotter70> Because Wine sucks
[3:46:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> My dad is a wine snob and I dropped this on him and he hates me for it.
[3:46:31] <%dekkitout> Who knew
[3:46:33] <%SpicyCheeseNips> Fuck you, you wine gargling high class snobby cock heads!
[3:46:33] <%TenderBabyBacon> Yep, no one can tell the difference. Especially the experts
[3:46:37] <+Kairi__> that's why boxed wine is top tier
[3:46:38] <%Dr_DangerPhD> wine has always been trash
[3:46:44] <%chill_o_wisp> FUCK OFF WITH YOUR TANNINS, KAREN!
[3:46:48] <Dest_121> wine taste tests are just excuses to drink during the day
[3:46:49] <%Aydarkzero> truth hurts
[3:46:50] <%SpicyCheeseNips> GOOD. YEAH GOOD.
[3:46:52] <Huntercd> Wine tastes bad
[3:46:53] <%weissguard> You got him.
[3:46:54] <%RealThiele> that sounds fake af
[3:46:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL LUL
[3:46:54] <%not_twitter_rowan> Wine is the worst tasting alcohol for sure.
[3:46:56] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt People would taste the SAME WINE and get DIFFERENT results
[3:46:56] <%trustycoyote> @Kairi__ This guy knows whatsup
[3:46:57] <redrins> even if that wasnt the case no two batches of wine are ever the same so within the same brand you can have subtle different tastes
[3:46:57] <+Kduff89> Fuck em
[3:46:57] <StebTheVee> This was in Adam Ruins Everything
[3:46:58] <%linSP> “that’s a good year” yeah shut up
[3:46:58] <Them00n> Yeah but the entire field of Psychology is psuedoscience so I'm a little skeptical of those studies.
[3:46:58] <%heartlesshealer> nice @doc_ock_rokc
[3:46:59] <+Merhabi> I dunno some of that stuff tastes like straight poison
[3:47:02] <%NitronStreams> They hated him because he told the truth

[3:48:11] <%UvBenServed> Placebo
[3:48:18] <%weissguard> @clempstwitch PogChamp
[3:48:21] <%kyh9> Maruki, just admit you want to inject everyone with heroin
[3:48:24] <%Zombrocom> Ok yeah, his villain twist is he is going to brainwash the world into being happy
[3:48:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Depends on the art apraisment pat. Historical works need to be verified as non copies. but modern art apraisment is largely based on hype.
[3:48:27] <%joe_bagadou_nautz> Thankyou daddy clemps
[3:48:28] <clempstwitch> I'd share my problems to Maruki then lay my head on his lap, maybe
[3:48:31] <%burgerkingwiki> burgerkingwiki subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! this is epic how would you rate the new music so far pat
[3:48:32] <%StoicMoogle> The wine tasting master test asks you to taste the year and origin of the wine blindly. How the fuck
