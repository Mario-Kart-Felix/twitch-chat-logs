[0:07:42] <@SSaryn> Risk of Rain is basically a side-scrolling Isaac Rougelike em up. It's also insanely hard.
[0:07:44] <+Aztec50> it is kiiiiinda like dead cells
[0:07:45] <%Linearlinera> isn't Risk of Rain 2 like... 3D?

[0:07:52] <AncelDeLambert> god I hate roguelikes
[0:07:52] <JZPotter> Risk of Rain sounds like a shitty romance novel
[0:07:53] <Mr_Strut> The music is super good.

[0:48:16] <%crontin956> @valachi They did fistycuffs of a fate game, all the weebs came creeping out the walls
[0:48:20] <graemecrackers1> Oh no
[0:48:21] <%kujofire990> OH YEAHHH
[0:48:22] <%ltdogg707> They did
[0:48:23] <%konekoryugamine> {C R A Z Y T A L K ]
[0:48:28] <$Plutt_bug> Paaat, water with or without lemon?
[0:48:30] <%CerberusDriver> The scythe is so slow
[0:48:33] <MyNameIsRasus> it's almost like the old hunters in a sense where youre fighting the hardest enemies in the game and getting no blood echoes
[0:48:33] <artoflec> Fate is the thing where king arthur is a cute girl right
[0:48:39] <askinWW> 2 scared 2 fight chester
[0:48:39] <KaiserMario> @grayjammer true, but ds1 was the first time for a lot of people, so it obviously took more time, then 2 was bloated, but by the time 3 came out everyone knew how to play, and the gameplay was faster...
[0:48:44] <valachi> Don't show them the girls in the mobile game, they might get arrested.
[0:48:54] <valachi> @artoflec Yes, Nero is also a girl in that game
[0:48:57] <+PenmanLupine> @artoflec it's the thing where genderbent myth and history figures fight for reasons powered by cum
[0:49:07] <artoflec> sounds gr8 im in
[0:49:09] <Lysdexic9541> How exactly does one backstab with a scythe?
[0:49:15] <%CerberusDriver> poor Solaire
[0:49:15] <ancrest_tant> @arcadeking48 Early level calculus "use this formula to end up with another formula that leads to the correct formula"
[0:49:16] <garbageheaphound> its actually pretty good
[0:49:18] <valachi> iirc it happens because enough people thought Arthur was a girl
[0:49:29] <+Jv9ufxcy> Nice Margaret Moonlight build
[0:49:33] <arcadeking48> @artoflec I think Jack the Ripper is a loli in that series, so probably yes King Arthur too
[0:49:34] <%ltdogg707> RIP Sun bro
[0:49:37] <MyNameIsRasus> it's the thing where a girl shoves the earth in her cooch
[0:49:38] <valachi> So if you're a super big dick hero and people think you're a tri dicked asshole ythat's who you would be
[0:49:53] <Tampaoster> seriously pat? come on man
[0:49:53] <grayjammer> @KaiserMario I think it's less a case of length, and more a case of pacing that people didn't like abt DS3
[0:49:59] <Kirbachev> Sweet, another episode of Angriest Souls
[0:50:01] <+TheBimbollo> Using big cheats I see
[0:50:04] <%JinNBK> @Lysdexic9541 by pushing the flat end through someones back apatFist
[0:50:06] <Tampaoster> you are better than that!
[0:50:10] <valachi> @arcadeking48 That's not really Jack. It's an amalgamation of aborted fetuses that kills prostitutes and wants to be unbirthed.
[0:50:13] <arcadeking48> @ancrest_tant And dont forget, the only time you'll ever use it is to pass that class!
[0:50:18] <+ricotez> what does the silver pendant do?
[0:50:19] <valachi> Literally
[0:50:20] <Tampaoster> BIG CHETAS FOR BIG BOIS
[0:50:30] <%Agami23> jack the ripper as a knife is cooler
[0:50:37] <MyNameIsRasus> @ricotez shield for the black evil
[0:50:37] <%ltdogg707> Yea Magic is for losers
[0:50:40] <+tegas_> We talking about fate?
[0:50:41] <KaiserMario> @grayjammer That was certainly the main issue
[0:50:44] <FunkyStreams> makes no sense the the scythe does as much damge as it does
[0:50:48] <jack_s1n> also there is a whole show about little girls making out but people pretend it doesn't exist
[0:50:50] <arcadeking48> @valachi That would be awesome in an over-the-top kinda way, except its still a loli
[0:50:50] <%JinNBK> apatBig sack
[0:50:55] <KoyaMusa> you KNOW he is not better than that
[0:50:57] <+TheBimbollo> Magic is cool, miracles in the other hand...
[0:50:59] <+future_famous_person> yo pat did you watch the doom eternal gameplay footage?
[0:51:04] <valachi> She also calls you mama no matter what gender you are
[0:51:15] <ArgentUndaCova> Very Good!
[0:51:16] <Tampaoster> i know but a man can dream about the gremlin becoming better r
[0:51:17] <arcadeking48> @valachi Dare I ask why?
[0:51:19] <%skizzuto> the silver pendant reflects dark magic @ricotez
[0:51:20] <%crontin956> Oh wait are we talking about Fate now? I'm playing FGO so I haven't been reading chat
[0:51:21] <Divryne> FIRE.

[0:51:31] <Divryne> That roast.
[0:51:33] <+PenmanLupine> pretend all you want, it does exist. part of the franchise. part of the canon. underaged girls kissing in bathtubs is canon to the fate universe
[0:51:35] <+shawntk_> come now, it isn't that obvious
[0:51:35] <+tegas_> I read aborted fetuses so assumed it was fate.

[0:52:11] <AncelDeLambert> keep trying loser
[0:52:12] <Tampaoster> nice pat
[0:52:13] <$Plutt_bug> the pendant is the most useless item
[0:52:14] <arcadeking48> @valachi Yeah
[0:52:15] <Tampaoster> very nice
[0:52:16] <ArgentUndaCova> 25% success rate doodGood
[0:52:17] <ancrest_tant> @arcadeking48 I have the say the coolest part of having the teacher I had in high school was having real life applications to calculus, which were really fucking hard. I understood why people just change majors once they find that part out.
[0:52:18] <+kiiiirsten> ALmost got the backhand part 2
[0:52:21] <grayjammer> Ya Botchin' it
[0:52:22] <%CerberusDriver> ruff

[0:52:33] <megamanx74> lol
[0:52:35] <valachi> So since she's your servant she thinks you're her mom
[0:52:36] <FunkyStreams> Why is their Artorias blood all over this area?
[0:52:38] <+BishopBain> So what's up with the blue goo?
[0:52:39] <$Plutt_bug> Congratulations, you played yourself
[0:52:41] <%Agami23> berserker jack the ripper will always be cooler than assassin jack the ripper.
[0:52:48] <%CerberusDriver> its not artorias blood, its abyss goo
[0:52:54] <FunkyStreams> ah
[0:52:55] <arcadeking48> @valachi I don't know how to respond to that.
[0:52:58] <+kiiiirsten> it's The Abyss
[0:53:01] <AncelDeLambert> [CRAZY TALK]
[0:53:02] <+BishopBain> Why does the abyss have goo?
[0:53:03] <valachi> @arcadeking48 Don't
[0:53:06] <%ECRead> abyss cummies
[0:53:07] <Tampaoster> that infected arterias
[0:53:09] <CatmanIX> artorias was just full of abyss goo
[0:53:10] <%crontin956> @Agami23 Is stragne/Fake worth reading? I haven't sincce it never seems to get updates from the author
[0:53:13] <BlackV0rt3x> missed the artorias fight, how did pat do?
[0:53:14] <+tegas_> My favorite piece of Fate fan canon is that Francis Drake is actually Elizabeth.
[0:53:15] <$Plutt_bug> Soul Sacrifice dope

[0:53:19] <valachi> Soul Sacrifice Delta is god tier

[0:54:06] <+tegas_> The big problem with strange fake and a lot of Fate stuff is the Gilgamesh fetish.

[0:55:53] <+tegas_> @Gregoryjk16 Watch Zero then read the VN if you have unlimited time works.
[0:55:56] <valachi> King Arthur has two forms. One is the Saber class that most people know
[0:55:56] <ancrest_tant> I don't think I've ever seen a vagrant
[0:55:58] <StaticEntry> Noble hobo Vagrant san
[0:56:00] <+AstuteBiscuit> I've only ever seen one in the lower undead burg after killing capra, and it nuked me with its little projectiles
[0:56:01] <+blademaster247> I feel like I've seen more Vagrants between you and Paige playing this than I have in all my time personally playing Dark Souls
[0:56:03] <$Plutt_bug> This is the only souls DLC i like
[0:56:05] <grayjammer> @KaiserMario Huh. Well, the more ya know. I gotta feeling the DLC bosses have something to do with that DS3 figure...
[0:56:07] <Eaglestrike117> Dont watch zero first
[0:56:09] <viewtifulr> go on just do that and deny his look
[0:56:10] <valachi> The other is a HUGE titted woman who rides a horse
[0:56:14] <%ltdogg707> @Gregoryjk16 you would have a lot to watch and play if you wanted to get into fate
[0:56:18] <valachi> Like

[1:28:29] <+nogoodusernamesleft156> the delay rule is punishment for a miss hit, swing without hitting something and watch your character stagger for a few frames.
[1:28:33] <%goose_attack_almanac> Remember kids, if you need to fight a fuck off huge dragon, just use farming tools
[1:28:36] <Tampaoster> time for the big boi

[1:34:57] <sjcodan> JORB
[1:34:57] <ValidVenasaur> does parry timing differ from shield to shield?
[1:34:58] <%anime_boyz> you can mash it and his second swing will usually count as a parry
[1:34:58] <$GohanEgret> on off drink hit
[1:34:59] <%goose_attack_almanac> Looks like that was Simple and Clean
[1:35:02] <cyrus233> why is everyone laughing? he was trying to parrry, no shit he didn't move
[1:35:04] <%JinNBK> that was upsetting, siri play gangnam style
[1:35:17] <ThorW> @AngriestPat If you wanna parry Gwyn on his first attack, parry right when he begins his swing
[1:35:18] <Tampaoster> you have one job and you didnt
[1:35:25] <SatansDick1> pat is the final boss of dark souls
[1:35:29] <+wolfdude_120> I mean, it's you and like a hundred other dudes combined
[1:35:30] <flattopswag> So has anyone shopped the sack on Pat's head to be a McDonald's bag yet?
[1:35:33] <LtThunderbolt> "opens ears"
[1:35:38] <metallic_snake> that theme song mix up in ds3 is HYPE
[1:35:43] <+Arkfyre> It's not the DS1 character, it's every person who has ever linked the fire
[1:35:47] <%JackalKing> Its also gwyn
[1:35:48] <%templar010> unmuted at the perfect time
[1:35:49] <MyNameIsRasus> unpopular opinion: ds2 lore is the best in the souls series
[1:35:53] <StaticEntry> I wish the final boss was just Giant Dad
[1:35:54] <%Lion_kun> well you don't know how many cycles happened between ds1 and ds3
[1:35:55] <%BioApple> @ValidVenasaur some items have more parry frames but DS1 is in general pretty generous with them
[1:35:56] <sjcodan> He's even got the DWG Ring
[1:36:01] <$nademonkey1100> ehh i will never finish ds 3 i cant play that one
[1:36:05] <grayjammer> @Arkfyre Which includes the DS1 character, silly
[1:36:08] <%CerberusDriver> @MyNameIsRasus yeah thats why its unpopular opinion
[1:36:09] <%goose_attack_almanac> It could be a month and she`d forget Pat.
[1:36:10] <%JinNBK> wait chat, did paige play ds2?

[1:36:35] <Laycas49> Skelmo watching in horror as you slaughter his people
[1:36:35] <AutisticLootist93> It's pretty cool, especially how he changes things up during the fight, like going from melee to magic and so on.

[1:39:25] <+Grayhammatter> sackus
[1:39:27] <Gorgen> Why did you get naked for the cut scene
[1:39:27] <KoyaMusa> they did so little with the primordial serpents going forward
[1:39:29] <+TMulharin> trust can not be patched

[1:39:35] <%Mornaka> @AngriestPat so are they multi-headed or is there more than 2 of them
[1:39:38] <StaticEntry> Why dont the serpents show up in 2 or 3 they are immortal right?
[1:39:38] <+purps26> that spear is so dumb looking in a cutscene
[1:39:43] <lotharrio> You're the monster, and they're your tentacles.
[1:39:47] <%Dingus_Tickler> Pat those Serpents are your Spirit Animals. It's fitting that you don't like them
[1:39:47] <+Jack8274> Kreygasm this music
[1:39:50] <%superc37> completely the negates the whole reason for offering a choice to begin with
[1:39:50] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT ENDS AT 106
[1:39:53] <+kiiiirsten> wipes tear from eye
[1:39:55] <mayorrev> !deathcount
[1:39:56] <Mimpyflip> ELMO IS PROUD
[1:39:57] <Tampaoster> DAWL LAWD
[1:39:58] <%JackalKing> No, it works just fine with Dark Souls 2 if someone came along and killed your character then linked the flame
[1:39:58] <+kiiiirsten> thank you kenpachi you faithful warrior
[1:39:59] <%TheGershon> That's such a flat ending
[1:40:00] <ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat Wouldn't it be fair that the serpents ARE technically this world's REAL "gods?" I mean they're great manipulators and such...what do you think?
[1:40:00] <FunkyStreams> Elmo wants you to play DS3
[1:40:01] <MyNameIsRasus> Yeah it can
[1:40:02] <ArgentUndaCova> Elmoooooooooooo~~~

[1:40:11] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 40m 13s.
[1:40:12] <mr_slaide> DAH BABUH

[1:40:20] <zal_silverfang> more elmo
[1:40:21] <%Jpdodds> @superc37 It could still be either one. As Aldia said, even if the fire dies, a single ember is enough for someone else to rekindle
[1:40:21] <%ssjklyco> They could just do a Shin Megami and just make sequels based off of the endings.
[1:40:21] <brainpipe> god i hate those serpent faces

[1:40:30] <%RageKingDomo> too many deaths
[1:40:31] <flattopswag> I kinda wanted you to fail more tbh

[1:41:24] <%eucyon> Cat and dog is best combo
[1:41:25] <MyNameIsRasus> @angriestpat whenever someone doesn't link the fire, eventually someone comes and links it, so ages of dark and fire keep switching. so it can lead t0 ds2
[1:41:26] <%Ferakin> You're not fooling anyone
[1:41:26] <%Momohead134> Warframe when pat
[1:41:26] <crimsonharvest> Dog serves a different purpose imo

[1:41:31] <CrimsonGargoyle> WHENFRAME
[1:41:31] <StaticEntry> dont matter if you link the flame or not, all the npcs and pcs are in parallel worlds and can link the flame in their worlds
[1:41:32] <%superc37> @jpdodds still, it defeats the purpose of offering a choice if the choice itself means nothing.
[1:41:36] <+bonzosan> gun is best pet
[1:41:37] <flattopswag> Man I unironically hate bulldogs and pugs
[1:41:38] <%Mornaka> Bulldogs are adorably ugly

[1:41:38] <deviljhojho94> He feels
[1:41:40] <%Dingus_Tickler> Huskies & Malamutes with calm personalities and don't bark are basically huge cats
[1:41:47] <$nademonkey1100> bull dogs are the best dogs ever fuck you if you dont like them

[1:44:20] <%superc37> @jpdodds no, the idea of cycles was introduced in ds2 not ds1 as i said earlier
[1:44:21] <xiccy> don't did Warframe tho...

[1:44:45] <+TheBimbollo> Did you hear about the Bethesda shit show with The Evil Within 2?
[1:44:46] <@SSaryn> Loading times is in that big 2.
[1:44:47] <FunkyStreams> you ever played at 144fps?
[1:44:47] <SatansDick1> what is your shirt
[1:44:50] <@SSaryn> Loading times and 60FPS.

[1:45:01] <BlackV0rt3x> Pat, will you ever consider a sl1 run in any of the souls games?
[1:45:06] <Chainshada> Saw a lot of people saying they'll review it negatively because there was a bug that stopped older CPUs booting the game..which was fixed before it launched.
[1:45:12] <ThorW> Sure is nice they delayed the PC port 8 months for it to be lackluster as a port
[1:45:13] <%superc37> like, ds1 was clearly meant to be a standalone game until it grew in popularity and the publisher wanted sequels
[1:45:14] <OotsyMahDootsie> what's your shirt Pat?
[1:45:15] <+yourbuddycarl> im more a fan of MHGU so im waiting for it

[1:45:54] <+Jack8274> I loved SL1 in Dark Souls 2 because you could co-op with people anywhere
[1:45:54] <Tampaoster> Have you seen the doom gameplay footage pat?

[1:46:21] <ZeroCount> I need a shirt of G dancing @angriestpat
[1:46:22] <$RaikenTB> n64 version of 2
[1:46:25] <+TheBimbollo> Resident Evil Remake randomizer is dope
[1:46:26] <%ssjklyco> My Meowscular chef shirt is the best.
[1:46:27] <+haseoseerlane> that might exist?
[1:46:27] <%Ferakin> Have you tried the REmake randomizer?
[1:46:30] <Xystant> omg that would be amazing
[1:46:30] <%fallen92x> N64 version of RE2 has a randomizer mode built in
[1:46:32] <crimsonharvest> patfinder is a tabletop RPG
[1:46:33] <mr_slaide> It's a game like Pillars.
[1:46:35] <Mimpyflip> have any interest in randomized pokemon encounter runs?
[1:46:37] <%ThatRandomGuy661> Gotta finish the current RE run before doing another

[1:46:43] <+MugenSandan> @AngriestPat Pat out of curiosity have you ever heard of a game called Dungeon Fighter Online? It's pretty much the baby of Streets of Rage and Diablo. Feels so weird that this game exists and has actually been in striking range of WoW in terms of population in the past but it feels like no one knows about it.
[1:46:44] <%wizkid50000> *hi
[1:46:46] <+yourbuddycarl> You got me re(pun) addicted to RE2 you bastard

[2:05:12] <$RaikenTB> antman good
[2:05:13] <buffmurffy> why not blackkklansman?
[2:05:13] <%Jpdodds> Ant-Man is better
[2:05:14] <+Jack8274> Mission Impossible was great if you haven't seen that
[2:05:16] <faldin> be careful with incredibles
[2:05:16] <%Asagi66> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[2:05:17] <$LocDogX86X> Ant Man do it
[2:05:17] <Spydurman> Incredibles 2 is super good
[2:05:18] <%Agami23> watch the slenderman movie so you can die inside.
[2:05:19] <$Plutt_bug> Pay for one ticket see both movies
[2:05:21] <%Lion_kun> Watch the Meg
[2:05:23] <MyNameIsRasus> INCREDIBLES IS THE BETTER CHOICE
[2:05:26] <tearsaurther> Teen titans go
[2:05:26] <ThePuddingDead> its not
[2:05:26] <Twoiis> Watch Teen Titans Go movie.
[2:05:27] <LtThunderbolt> inedibles
[2:05:34] <+nathandiel> Got here too late
[2:05:35] <TheMilhouseExperience> 2 more and then Marvel can fuck off to oblivion for all I care.
[2:05:35] <%TheImmortal70> @angriestpat Remember pat, the seizure shit is a HUGE problem
[2:05:38] <Alien3isTopTier> You don't need to see Ant-Man, ever.
[2:05:41] <crimsonharvest> I grabbed La Mulana 2 and i'm HOOKED on this shit it's fascinating
[2:05:42] <$GohanEgret> that movie is boring
[2:05:45] <Belutima> Teen Titans Go movie
[2:05:46] <%ssjklyco> Me and a friend snuck in and saw after earth.
[2:05:51] <EVA_Unit02> Loved Inglorious Bastards
[2:05:52] <SatansDick1> paige would die watcing incredinles
[2:05:52] <jinkipng> was it???
[2:05:54] <Spydurman> Inglorious Bastards is soooo good. Top 10 for me
[2:05:55] <%ssjklyco> We wanted money back for a movie we didnt pay for
[2:05:56] <+Jack8274> Incredibles 2 gave me epilepsy
[2:05:57] <BlackV0rt3x> But the Jew Bear made an amazing scene
[2:05:58] <turretgunz> does Paige exist anymore?
[2:06:03] <%TheGershon> my brother and I spent an entire day at the movies off one set of tickets
[2:06:05] <%bevyrage> @angriestpat how about some tabletop simulator small games? like uno or chinese checkers, or boss monster, or dark tower?
[2:06:06] <SuperMintSoda> it wasn't 4 hours of Brad Pitt killing Nazi's. False advertising
[2:06:12] <%Dani_el_Dani> @ssjklyco LOL
[2:06:13] <Spydurman> that opening monologue by the nazi about rats is so creepy
[2:06:13] <faldin> incredibles 2 gave me a really bad headache
[2:06:17] <buffmurffy> inglorious basterds is not a great movie
[2:06:19] <FunkyStreams> its actually 497 hours and 30 minutes
[2:06:19] <Ell1ot> that's almost as long as it takes you to beat bed of chaos
[2:06:22] <sjcodan> PLAY VIDEO GAME
[2:06:22] <+kiiiirsten> RIP elmo
[2:06:23] <$Plutt_bug> Pat, what is your opinion of Battlefield 1 and/or the battlefield genre. Recently I have fallen in love with Battlefield 1.
[2:06:28] <ThePuddingDead> its bad and the movie's bad
[2:06:36] <subjectg> inglorious basterds had cut content, can you believe it?
[2:06:37] <+Jack8274> Little pink jellybeans
[2:06:39] <Tuskor13> its almost like they're both paws
[2:06:39] <+FrostMass22> Incredibles 2 apparently has a seizure-inducing scene in it
[2:06:39] <TheMilhouseExperience> The first and last scenes are the only scenes worth watching in a Tarentino movie.
[2:06:39] <+kiiiirsten> INcredibles 2 was good though
[2:06:43] <%goose_attack_almanac> But you're forgetting
[2:06:43] <%TheImmortal70> How do you know what a rabbit's feet feel like?
[2:06:43] <%TheGershon> dude how tf did they get away with that
[2:06:44] <SatansDick1> watch slender man
[2:06:45] <+kiiiirsten> Wow Pat that was a deep thought
[2:06:45] <%MagickBurritoh> What do rabbit feet feel like
[2:06:47] <+nathandiel> pAT HAD A SEIZURE?
[2:06:47] <dagreenpillow> You touched rabbits?
[2:06:47] <Spydurman> didn't bother me but I can definitely see those effects hurting your eyes
[2:06:47] <%D_day> Got any Fortnite wins under your belt old man? apatDab
[2:06:50] <%goose_attack_almanac> Elastigirl is like three times as thicc
[2:06:50] <%TheGershon> a few scenes
[2:06:55] <MyNameIsRasus> multiple scenes
[2:07:02] <%Superstarsage> You've been in a rabbit? what?
[2:07:02] <ThePuddingDead> at japan right?
[2:07:04] <crimsonharvest> My cat finally discovered that the scary noise machine makes cold air
[2:07:05] <+JoeStillLife> I have a rabbit
[2:07:06] <%ssjklyco> I want to try and eat rabbit
[2:07:06] <zepelinnn> @angriestpat play R6 and use Ash and Ela for maximum speed shenanigans
[2:07:08] <KoyaMusa> pat have you touched eureka pagos at all?
[2:07:10] <$Plutt_bug> A rabbit bit your penis, Pat?
[2:07:10] <+FrostMass22> Pat knows about rabbit feet because of all the rabbits he killed
[2:07:12] <FunkyStreams> 10 times in rapid succession
[2:07:13] <ThePuddingDead> ah
[2:07:13] <tearsaurther> Tarantino foot fetish
[2:07:14] <SatansDick1> whos thiccer elstigirl or 2b
[2:07:15] <%Jpdodds> You touch youmg rabbits, boivin?
[2:07:17] <SuperMintSoda> Rabbits are like tiny fuzzy horses with long ears and different shapes heads and legs
[2:07:18] <FunkyStreams> the rabbit dies shortly after
[2:07:20] <%TheImmortal70> 2b EASY
[2:07:24] <Max_Capacity> Just beat nergigante woo
[2:07:29] <SuperMintSoda> so they're nothing like horses actually
[2:07:34] <+Jack8274> Warframe ate 14 for breakfast
[2:07:39] <JGardner88> @AngriestPat Don't feel bad Pat I didnt even touch Eureka or the latest Extremes
