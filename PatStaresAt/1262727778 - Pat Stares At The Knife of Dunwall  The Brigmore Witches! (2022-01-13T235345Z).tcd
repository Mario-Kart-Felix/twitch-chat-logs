[0:04:30] <Jetsfantasy> I'm doing SL1 runs of Dark Souls to bide my time. I'm on DS3 now
[0:04:31] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Is the Sony thing an admission that the PS5 production situation isn't going to get better anytime soon?

[0:06:26] <%cartakus> Halo halo
[0:06:30] <ExpressNode> Going alright. I'm alive at least
[0:06:36] <hot4dukat> Destiny players in heated debate over Orbs
[0:06:50] <%StephanieSadGirl> So friends, the real question is... Does Pat mpreg Plague, or does Plague mpreg Pat, and regardless does paige see and then go 'oh my boys'?
[0:06:58] <ExpressNode> There are still destiny players?
[0:07:17] <%cartakus> nah
[0:07:21] <thunderborn32> actually paige puts the babies in them
[0:07:22] <%RealThiele> Plague mpregs pat, but pat is the bitch power bottom
[0:07:26] <%hairtoday> @StephanieSadGirl paige mpregs paige somehow
[0:07:36] <%GhoulishCripple> @stephaniesadgirl well Plague reproduces via spores so I guess he'd had to mpreg oat
[0:07:37] <hot4dukat> If you went to MAGfest you are a COVID vector
[0:07:38] <+jeanclaudejunkeh> mpregs the ussy
[0:07:40] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> ANIME
[0:07:42] <%StephanieSadGirl> @StephanieSadGirl That assumes that she can find herself w/o out glasses
[0:07:52] <EynoStiles> Bro dudes defending destiny really need to rethink their choices
[0:07:59] <%StephanieSadGirl> @GhoulishCripple OOOHHH I love that, Pat Mpreged by plague's spore babies
[0:07:59] <marvel877> The rumor come out: does Pat the mpreg?
[0:08:00] <%Bailey__Gaming> Paige Mpregs Skelmo you mean

[0:08:47] <EynoStiles> mpregussu?
[0:08:53] <oda_flobunaga> What I don't understand is just how deprived Pat's life to not know what Lasagna is

[1:13:15] <%Agami23> when you think about it, sin eaters are the weed of monsters.

[1:19:48] <@PeachSaliva> @rickyrelucent hoping they’ll be here soon, probably in the next few days
[1:19:50] <ToneBacas> DLC is super good. don't bother with the Trials DLC, it's just challenges
[1:19:54] <+gyabs> they actually carry over, but ok

[1:34:10] <+vanareus> These Dishonored DLCs are nuts
[1:34:16] <+mmack093> Dishonored didn't last long huh lol
[1:34:19] <BigFingerRo> I was making gingerbread and when the timer went off I saw the notif
[1:34:21] <%RealThiele> druid seem like a half sorcery half miracle
[1:34:27] <raisenbran> LMFAO
[1:34:27] <DianaTheAscian> Did Pat ever beat that druid boss last stream?
[1:34:38] <NireFuster> Dishonored? What do you mean? THe stream just started :)
[1:34:41] <sirrice77> @DianaTheAscian He did
[1:34:42] <%cartakus> yes
[1:34:45] <+vanareus> @realthiele tbf that's how they often are
[1:34:49] <%Shonen_hero> was it specifically that tidbit about your save carrying over that did the stream in, or was that just part of it?
[1:35:06] <BigFingerRo> Have we seen the abyss watchers yet?
[1:35:06] <raisenbran> Ya the stream totally just started Kappa
[1:35:06] <%cartakus> But them he could not beat him again
[1:35:16] <NireFuster> LUL fair enough
[1:35:18] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> BORK
[1:35:18] <%Shonen_hero> fair
[1:35:20] <wasdsf> this is actually a little known dishonored dlc: darl souls
[1:35:23] <sirrice77> Dark souls braindead easy confirmed
[1:35:25] <+mmack093> 2 neurons aren't available right now
[1:35:31] <Dead_Trickster> The discussion on what makes a lasagna a lasagna massively lowered the brain levels.
[1:35:32] <NireFuster> by the way pat, the stream name is Darl Souls LUL
[1:35:34] <Treasure_Vault> just wanna dark souls forward into unga
[1:35:36] <comicalmond> pat no work good
[1:35:38] <raisenbran> NotLikeThis
[1:35:38] <%superc37> wait wht happened to dishonored
[1:35:38] <%Daziggedey> Knowing your upgrades carried over and you didn't get that thing is going to gnaw at you everytime you play it now
[1:35:46] <BigFingerRo> is he banana crazed?
[1:35:49] <%JustToWatch> it's true, Pat has been especially stupid tonight
[1:35:51] <%StephanieSadGirl> BANDANAS B A N D A N A S
[1:35:59] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[1:36:01] <%twistedj3ster> he's going bandanas, gangbusters even
[1:36:02] <+Jack8274> The irony is, most people would think Dark Souls needs more brain power
[1:36:08] <raisenbran> Perfect LUL
[1:36:17] <NireFuster> Green magic, wow
[1:36:19] <%StephanieSadGirl> hes dying!
[1:36:20] <raisenbran> Nananananas
[1:36:23] <%sapphic_fae> You can unga bunga dark souls way more easily than Dishonored
[1:36:24] <NireFuster> That looks awesome
[1:36:25] <phoronthewriter> darl that sob
[1:36:30] <BigFingerRo> man I love the evangelists, they're so grotesque
[1:36:42] <tanarath> Gonna be real, most of Dishonoured's stuff requires timing and patience to do easily or big powers to do quickly, either of which Pat can do while streaming usually.
[1:36:44] <%Logoth_> I like the lime green woolie spear
[1:36:48] <BigFingerRo> the morticians asses
[1:36:49] <+mmack093> the morticians asses

[1:41:10] <%Zundelle> this was by far my favorite ds3 mod
[1:41:12] <BigFingerRo> @SpoopySkeletman well, the original kinda made you start with the heavy axe always, regardless of class, and just made it near impossible to use magic because the mana doesn't regen
[1:41:17] <%Issun135> is the green spells like a poison,earth,or wind type spell?
[1:41:19] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Have you tried any of those air abilities yet?

[1:41:58] <SaltyAzteca> Gives me some YYH vibes LUL
[1:41:59] <%Agami23> thats the weapon the lost soul class starts with
[1:42:10] <+vanareus> I just realized, no one is going to believe the stream just started because we're in gameplay
[1:42:28] <+Havictos> It looks cool but can you actually hit anything with that spread?
[1:42:30] <%Issun135> wow those bleed spells are fast now.
[1:42:31] <DianaTheAscian> I wonder if that tree is a place you can get to
[1:42:35] <BigFingerRo> this almost doesn't look like ds
[1:42:37] <$SGrim> Magic bullet fight!
[1:42:37] <%LaughingCatt> hot damn that range
[1:42:38] <FrostedZaibatsu> Since when are druids, wolfmen?
[1:42:41] <krionik77> you can infuse those with almost any damage type. the fists.
[1:42:53] <%JonathLP> He wants chat to notice him
[1:42:54] <+mmack093> Why the shadows on your body going crazy
[1:42:54] <%sendart> psaDogchamp
[1:42:56] <BigFingerRo> it looks like that janky game about chernobyl we saw on stream once
[1:42:56] <MidnightPacif1c> wüf
[1:43:00] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> a t t e n t i o n
[1:43:06] <Verdantree> Look at that gorgeous pup head
[1:43:07] <%BreakfastSampler> psaDogchamp
[1:43:10] <DeltaPangaea> Have you not been paying attention, druids have been wolfmen for like over a decade now
[1:43:11] <%Zundelle> psaDogchamp MEEEEE
[1:43:23] <KaiserMario> Oh thank god, it's Dark Souls! I'm glad I came back LUL
[1:43:24] <DeltaPangaea> And sometimes bear men
[1:43:26] <raisenbran> The BOI
[1:43:26] <chhdez> A whole decade eh
[1:43:28] <%notsoy> wow, dishonored was that bad?
[1:43:33] <susukouhai> he bein cute
[1:43:58] <%StephanieSadGirl> Mushroom friends!
[1:44:00] <+Havictos> get smoked
[1:44:06] <%LaughingCatt> you got booped
[1:44:06] <tanarath> r i p
[1:44:08] <%StephanieSadGirl> get smoked
[1:44:13] <DianaTheAscian> Now you can use that shard
[1:44:15] <Treasure_Vault> yeah
[1:44:15] <%Zundelle> making me the victor
[1:44:22] <thunderborn32> new spells, equipment, location redesigns. this mod seems kinda insane
[1:44:24] <%AoiRob> convergence WOOO
[1:44:45] <%bassoontyphoon> What happened to dishonoured??
[1:44:47] <susukouhai> jebaited
[1:44:47] <%greasypete00> was this mod annoying to get working?
[1:45:05] <DeltaPangaea> Yeah what's the mod process like?
[1:45:10] <+vanareus> @bassoontyphoon this is the 2nd dlc
[1:45:10] <%greasypete00> sick
[1:45:13] <DanThePumpkinman> het pat can you put cam in top right? can't see your souls. thanks!
[1:45:14] <bosssbatttle> okay im gona have to try this
[1:45:19] <RevenantJoy> Oh yeah Light sorcery is fricking awesome Pat. Teleport is this shit.
[1:45:26] <DeltaPangaea> Oooooh
[1:45:26] <%bassoontyphoon> @vanareus lmao
[1:45:28] <+mmack093> I really wish there was like a lightning mancer class that was as easy to use as pyromancy
[1:45:32] <DXLelouch24> Blood magic too
[1:45:40] <%StephanieSadGirl> Pat, how many bits do we gotta donate to get a camera ontop of Elmo's cat tree, for an elmo cam?
[1:45:40] <%tank7013> Even manual install is super easy. Literally just extract the folder and move everything to the directory
[1:45:45] <+imporia_> what was the mind changed about
[1:45:54] <%shurtal> pat beat owl? i mean Archdruid Caimar?
[1:45:57] <boostergoldz> lightning is super good in this
[1:45:57] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Do you think some inspiration for illusory walls came from the breakable walls with pork chops in Castlevania?
[1:46:03] <thunderborn32> wait does your class change the game story?
[1:46:04] <%Bread_Assassin> Dishonored DLC didn't last long.
[1:46:06] <tanarath> @bassoontyphoon Pat's brain didn't have enough juice for a quite complex stealth level & the missed rune didn't help.
[1:46:26] <RevenantJoy> @mmack093 That's kinda what Light sorcerer is. Light magic is just magic but with lightning dmg and it has its own flavor.
[1:46:31] <+TheBitingIrish> The living crystal armor is fucking bonkers
[1:46:31] <krionik77> air spells are fun, one allows you to run without losing stamina and you can drink Estes while running
[1:46:37] <SubjectX07x> Which convergence stream we on, 2 or 3?
[1:46:38] <%captain_thickthighs> pasta easy butter egg yolk and some cheese i think
[1:46:44] <SaltyAzteca> ooh new Drood spells
[1:46:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Hey Pat can you pause the stream I need to pee
[1:46:58] <KaiserMario> The Conclave? What's locked?
[1:47:00] <+Havictos> really? ok sure.
[1:47:03] <%AoiRob> @SubjectX07x part 2
[1:47:13] <+Havictos> Got any souls to pop?
[1:47:13] <%ZephynM> Just press the pause button the bottom left of the stream Kappa
[1:47:14] <%Zundelle> I really loved necromancy but it's half "wow I'm so cool" and half "why is my one time summon minion charging off a cliff for no reason"
[1:47:14] <SubjectX07x> Nice, was worried I missed some.
[1:47:25] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Pat pause the stream, @KosOrSomeSayKosm_  needs to pee
[1:47:26] <%AoiRob> @PatStaresAt you revived the boss remember?
[1:47:40] <SubjectX07x> Ohno
[1:47:43] <+TheBitingIrish> oh no LUL
[1:47:45] <+PirateKefka> I still need to beat base DS3.  But I'm replaying DS1 and also halfway through DeS
[1:47:47] <BackflipCharm> Go kill the boss again
[1:47:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @ZephynM yoooooooo
[1:47:50] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt You know what that means go kill him again.
[1:47:52] <%StephanieSadGirl> Pat, you gotta pause the stream @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ needs to pee!
[1:48:02] <SaltyAzteca> Could you get soft locked in there?
[1:48:03] <%AoiRob> REMATCH REMATCH REMATCH
[1:48:15] <+Captain_Spicy_> Pee in Pat's shirts ;)
[1:48:16] <SubjectX07x> Pee thine pants.
[1:48:16] <%Shonen_hero> don't give Batman any of your boners
[1:48:17] <@Ranryu692> that's what piss bottles are for
[1:48:18] <%strakillias> They have pants don't they
[1:48:22] <Verdantree> YUP
[1:48:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Darn
[1:48:26] <%AoiRob> @SaltyAzteca there's always the Darksign to teleport out
[1:48:27] <SaltyAzteca> DONT GET HYPE PAT
[1:48:29] <SubjectX07x> Ashen one, thouest must pisseth thine pants

[1:48:31] <yukichocomilk> the ring of eld

[1:48:31] <+Havictos> Really I had no clue honestly
[1:48:32] <SaltyAzteca> HOLD THE HYPE
[1:48:32] <MidnightPacif1c> Disc Room
[1:48:33] <KaiserMario> I always bring an empty bottle during streams
[1:48:35] <DianaTheAscian> I hope its good
[1:48:35] <%MelBrooksKA> Wha happun to Dishonored?
[1:48:39] <NireFuster> Ashen one, thoust needs to piss in thine pants
[1:48:40] <%greasypete00> 2 week advance
[1:48:41] <+UltraViolet371> if they accidentally send two copies can i have a copy
[1:48:42] <%oda_flobunaga> Watch it just be kinda okay
[1:48:46] <SaltyAzteca> @AoiRob Ahh good point, you do have that
[1:48:47] <+mmack093> I wish it was coming out on it's original release date
[1:48:51] <%JustToWatch> I hope they send your copy to me by mistake
[1:48:54] <atgithursdays> I hope the code they send you doesn't work so you have to wait like the rest of us
[1:48:56] <%oda_flobunaga> @MelBrooksKA da Goblins
[1:49:00] <yukichocomilk> it'll be the best game of all time
[1:49:02] <+OldManJEWc> finally upgrading my potato rig from like, 10 years  ago and I really wanna try this out. mostly been on PS4. I NEED THE COOL SHIT
[1:49:04] <NireFuster> LUL
[1:49:07] <%Zundelle> hold the hype, but fake hype so they send you a code
[1:49:08] <%Agami23> im glad pat decided not to go to the catacombs
[1:49:10] <scrumbotime> I hope they send pat's copy to me by mistake
[1:49:10] <%JustToWatch> Nothing personal of course
[1:49:10] <thunderborn32> @oda_flobunaga kinda okay is the standard
[1:49:13] <+Havictos> Nah hype is fine here From Software is still trustworthy as far as I know
[1:49:14] <%OrangeMDT> Watch they send it to Woolie early
[1:49:16] <horn_hero> so i've never heard of convergence, what mod is this?
[1:49:24] <SubjectX07x> I hope the copy they send is just a pipe bomb. But it's just confetti and then a code comes out after.
[1:49:27] <NireFuster> Have you seen all the character creation stuff yet Pat or are you just completely ignoring all content until you get to play it?
[1:49:32] <%shurtal> your hands fall off
[1:49:35] <%FacetiousAF> caffeine good
[1:49:37] <%FacetiousAF> psaGib
[1:49:40] <wasdsf> lol they send woolie the big cool box again
[1:49:40] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt You know if you don't play on day negative you'll spoiled to shit right?
[1:49:41] <%AoiRob> @horn_hero new magic spells, weapons and bosses
[1:49:44] <Verdantree> @mmack093 Elden Ring coming late means I get a whole month to be disappointed by Pokemon Legends though
[1:49:48] <%RealThiele> 3 weeks LUL
[1:49:49] <Treasure_Vault> Bunch a hour and a half streams for no reason
[1:49:49] <+mmack093> Pat just admit you already have elden ring
[1:49:51] <Sigma_190_Beta> @horn_hero Dude who made it wanted more magic options, so he made more magic.
[1:49:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Streaming that thing on release is probably gonna suck though because 80% of the audience is gonna be playing it themselves and therefore not watching it, kinda like it was with 14
[1:50:01] <GarettLefebvre> He's Canadian not Russian'
[1:50:06] <%AoiRob> do a 24 hours stream for ER ez
[1:50:07] <%ZephynM> God of War PC comes tomorrow. So I've got that to help me through to Elden Ring.
[1:50:09] <SubjectX07x> @wasdsf Man I forgot about that insane box Woolie got for Tsushima, that shit was nuts.
[1:50:13] <DanThePumpkinman> i expect your first elden ring stream to be like 10 hours lol
[1:50:13] <%cade_calrayn> does Paige ever win  an argument with that dog?
[1:50:14] <%StephanieSadGirl> Man, this weapon is so cool
[1:50:20] <+Havictos> @NireFuster The creator looks the best so far, you can make an actual human instead of some fuckin mutant
[1:50:21] <DianaTheAscian> Would he even be allowed to say if he did?
[1:50:22] <yukichocomilk> yeah I'm not gonna watch a single stream until I beat it
[1:50:22] <+OldManJEWc> do you think elden ring will be cross plat?
[1:50:25] <%Mr_Pylon> If he had Elden Ring he wouldn't be hanging out with us chumps right now
[1:50:26] <boostergoldz> why would you do that to the poor crab
[1:50:29] <scrumbotime> do a 24 hour straight recording session by yourself and chop it up like your video on the network test. Progressively more deranged Pat.
[1:50:40] <@GeneralSCPatton> I love Darl Souls 3
[1:50:43] <%MelBrooksKA> If Pat had Elden Ring you'd know, he'd be the smuggest piece of shit ever
[1:50:46] <KaiserMario> What if the only way to get early access to Elden Ring is to buy a BandaiNamco NFT? What then PAT?
[1:50:58] <NireFuster> @Havictos A lot of people are legitimately upset that others are happy you can make a human now because ''muh abomination'', but I'm just glad that I can actually make a cute female character without a fucking GUIDE, abominations can still be made tho
[1:50:59] <GarettLefebvre> Pat doesn't have the wherewithal to stream for 10m hours
[1:50:59] <+mmack093> My only wish for Elden ring is no poison swamps
[1:51:00] <krionik77> there's some crazy shit in this game, especially in endgame and new game plus.
[1:51:04] <+Fefe41> Maybe you should wear your bandai namco merch every stream and they'll send you an early copy
[1:51:10] <SubjectX07x> Darlington Souls 3: Scholars of the First Woolie Hole @GeneralSCPatton
[1:51:12] <%StephanieSadGirl> Pat, if you could get elden ring RIHGT NOW but had to get it out of a full dirty toilet, would you?
[1:51:16] <wasdsf> EldeNFT Ring
[1:51:23] <UnImprest> he'd be way worse than Max gettin FF7 early
[1:51:25] <Ferakin> You'll get an entire free roam poison swamp map and like it
[1:51:27] <%Agami23> you mean an offline stream?
[1:51:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @scrumbotime hour 72, the RedBull is now hooked up directly to the veins
[1:51:34] <Afterman_> pats gonna shill elden ring nfts
[1:51:35] <NireFuster> What if Fromsoftware started doing NFTs before release though :(
[1:51:35] <wasdsf> WHO THE FUCK IS THAT
[1:51:37] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt  Will this include fake chat backseating?
[1:51:40] <Jontman42> the fuck did she come from KEKW
[1:51:41] <+UltraViolet371> you were good at that one stream, do that again for sho
[1:51:44] <@ssjklyco> Eldin Ring comes out "So I beat the game "
[1:51:50] <+PirateKefka> I just try to create Laura S Arseid from Trails of Cold Steel in every Souls game I play for the first time
[1:51:50] <%doomunderthestairs> Ohh started Convergence earlier fuck yeah
[1:51:53] <%StephanieSadGirl> Hi Mildred
[1:51:55] <+mmack093> If from soft sent you a syringe with a mystery liquid in it and said if you inject it they'll give you elden ring now would you inject that mystery liquid
[1:52:00] <SaltyAzteca> @Jontman42 Where did she go?

[1:54:00] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Now hold on, why would you record an early impression of Elden RIng when we already have that? Wasn't the Beta just thta?
[1:54:05] <%doomunderthestairs> I mean he never really ok but this aint great

[1:57:02] <+UltraViolet371> @KaiserMario Starting in the Grand Archives is a lil goofy, but yeah still cool LUL
[1:57:03] <BigFingerRo> @KaiserMario rp-friendly area sounds like you'd find some profound cringe in there

[2:00:50] <SaltyAzteca> @BliVru nm, just explorin
[2:00:58] <KaiserMario> Considerinfar people are going with these mods, is there a possibility of people going full Half-Life 2 on it and make brand new games with it?
[2:00:58] <BigFingerRo> @bart_flintstone none, it's darl souls
[2:01:04] <krionik77> Yeah, you can jump down about where the tree is on the edge of that cliff behind the cart.
[2:01:05] <@GeneralSCPatton> @bart_flintstone 3 with the Convergence mod
[2:01:15] <%oda_flobunaga> Its the Brigmore Witches
[2:01:26] <%StephanieSadGirl> This build feels like the Guild Wars 1 Mesmer
[2:01:41] <BliVru> @kaisermario theres a Rogue like mod for ds 1 for example
[2:02:04] <%AoiRob> light it first?
[2:02:05] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:02:07] <KaiserMario> Yeah, but I mean, like Team Fortress, or Portal
[2:02:11] <%doomunderthestairs> no anri
[2:02:12] <SubjectX07x> Anri isn't though, in fact I don't think any of the quest NPC's really exist. :/
[2:02:26] <%doomunderthestairs> lunarWO lunarOW
[2:02:31] <%AoiRob> str covenant
[2:02:36] <SubjectX07x> Yuria doesn't spawn if you do Yoel's thing either.
[2:02:37] <%doomunderthestairs> ah I see
[2:02:40] <krionik77> Yeah, this is for raw melee damage stuff.
[2:02:49] <SaltyAzteca> the gym bros
[2:02:54] <%doomunderthestairs> I guess with the overhaul that was done those quests would have been tough to keep
[2:02:56] <NireFuster> LUL
[2:02:57] <%StephanieSadGirl> No husbando...
[2:02:58] <+kewlmyc> LUL
[2:03:05] <%doomunderthestairs> yes
[2:03:05] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> oh hey, more Souls!
[2:03:06] <SaltyAzteca> The bonfire was indeed lit
[2:03:06] <NireFuster> The little scream

[2:03:25] <%MelBrooksKA> Guh huh!
[2:03:27] <%cade_calrayn> To the Yoel Hole!
[2:03:33] <BliVru> @patstaresat Yoel can still die if u enter late game before his quest
[2:03:35] <SubjectX07x> I mean, if patches is there I sure as hell didn't see him.
[2:03:40] <+UltraViolet371> the true convergence, pat and ground
[2:03:54] <%StephanieSadGirl> @cade_calrayn Gotta pay the yoel toll if you wanna get this boys soul
[2:03:57] <%doomunderthestairs> at least Yoel is still mucking around
[2:04:18] <KaiserMario> You know, modders could mod DS3 into remakes of King's Field
[2:04:35] <krionik77> ye, he dont have much this time around, and I forget what yuria has to compensate.
[2:04:38] <+UltraViolet371> @KaiserMario shut up that would be amazing
[2:04:43] <+disgruntledgruntle> Chat is there significant differences in this mod compared to base game?
[2:04:46] <SubjectX07x> Yoel will still die once you complete the Abyss watchers so use him as much as you can if you don't care about hollowing.
[2:04:52] <+mmack093> Does this mod get rid of fire keeper waifu?
[2:04:56] <%Glass_Muffin> Glass_Muffin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 3 month streak! this looks cool

[2:05:30] <CrimsonGargoyle> the homeward said
[2:05:30] <BliVru> @newwillinium yes BUT it doesnt change the main story it just adds

[2:06:04] <Badgerconda_> pat this is crazy talk

[2:06:15] <%Agami23> nah pat, i'd totally watch pillars of eternity
[2:06:15] <%oda_flobunaga> Some of us like CRPGs
[2:06:15] <sephyrbr> I'd watch Pat being tripped every single turn
[2:06:15] <zhenthrim213> HOW DARE U
[2:06:16] <CrimsonGargoyle> i'd watch kingmaker, just not every kingmaker LUL
[2:06:16] <%Insom62> im not a liar how dare you
[2:06:16] <%AoiRob> They said, like liars
[2:06:17] <Profmcstevie> I love vibing to CRPG Pat, he clearly enjoys himself
[2:06:17] <Mojomoud> understandable, but holy shit Elden ring needs to get here faster
[2:06:18] <@Ranryu692> I'd leave the stream open while playing EDF
[2:06:20] <DeltaPangaea> I would but I get the feeling this is a "The stats say otherwise"
[2:06:20] <%notsoy> i mean, plenty of people watched y'all play kotor
[2:06:21] <%Shonen_hero> No I would man, I love that game!

[2:06:22] <BliVru> I would listen to your expirience i  the podcast
[2:06:22] <T_Sasquatch> I would watch it for a few mins LUL
[2:06:23] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt I have you in the background whether I'm watching or not, I would DEFINITELY still be here
[2:06:23] <+Catpurnicus> just like we all watched pillars
[2:06:25] <%hairtoday> i love kingmaker and i wouldn't watch it
[2:06:27] <%strakillias> I would watch that Mon-Thurs cause I'd be working lol
[2:06:29] <%Bread_Assassin> I'd watch it, but that sounds like it be awful to stream with the amount of text.
[2:06:29] <+vanareus> I've watched kingmaker streams before
[2:06:30] <%captain_thickthighs> Do it now try it what you got to loosew
[2:06:31] <+Double_Tap_That> I wouldn't watch it, but I'd have it on in the background while I did other stuff.
[2:06:31] <DianaTheAscian> I watch anything really
[2:06:31] <%cvp5127> pat i treat you like a podcast
[2:06:32] <+dasmause> i wouldnt watch that because 1) itll spoil me and 2) i usually watch the VODs
[2:06:34] <IvanMistwalker> I would watch that no joke
[2:06:34] <bosssbatttle> id for sure watch that
[2:06:35] <%CatastropheCorvid> I;m playing WOOTR and I'd watch Kingmaker
[2:06:36] <%Glass_Muffin> I feel like i would watch it considering youre at the part where you are just beasting on enemies @PatStaresAt
[2:06:37] <%Tearonex> I mea I'd leave it on in the background LUL
[2:06:38] <NewWillinium> Iwould watch the HELL out of Kingmaker
[2:06:38] <$ImExtremelyManly> i'll listen to it as a podcast
[2:06:40] <Sapientiae> did you do a test stream with kingmaker to see who shows?
[2:06:40] <%StephanieSadGirl> If Im a liar, then Paige isn't a furry
[2:06:42] <%CatastropheCorvid> *WOTR
[2:06:43] <+twohitgood> i probably wouldn't watch it. i'm sure someone else would, though.
[2:06:44] <Profmcstevie> All the podcast listeners don't give a fuuuck what you play
[2:06:54] <SupidaMan> this is fine to tho
[2:06:55] <SaltyAzteca> pppph

[2:07:04] <BarnYardFiddler> Muahahag
[2:07:08] <%AoiRob> texture borke
[2:07:09] <BliVru> ups no texture
[2:07:09] <%StephanieSadGirl> now THATS  a bonfire
[2:07:12] <%bevyrage> don't worry the fire burned off all the paint, but at least the primer is still sticking
[2:07:14] <%psidefx> Toguht it had a health bar for a sec
[2:07:17] <DeltaPangaea> I seem to recall the assertion in the past that the stats say CRPGs don't get anywhere near as much attention.
[2:07:17] <alroy909> those are uh... interesting textures
[2:07:22] <%jaco_checkbox> play Elden ring for 15 minutes and then play kingmaker
[2:07:24] <+twohitgood> missing textures?
[2:07:33] <%oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt if Paige was a member of the Furry Force, what would she be?
[2:07:50] <KaiserMario> Preggo doggo!
[2:07:56] <%maskofmichael> @oda_flobunaga Horny
[2:07:57] <KaiserMario> where?
[2:08:05] <DeltaPangaea> Did you miss when Paige rused Plague into making her a pokesona?
[2:08:09] <BarnYardFiddler> A Russian role playing isometric game
[2:08:14] <%MelBrooksKA> Her Vtuber is literally a fox girl
[2:08:14] <SaltyAzteca> K I L L
[2:08:18] <%AncelDeLambert> man, this mod looks sick, but with the burnout of Souls games I still have if I touch it at all I won't have the brain-juice for Eldin Ring

[2:08:29] <%greasypete00> beside ice swqord
[2:08:29] <+mmack093> blind88
[2:08:32] <%Shonen_hero> I feel like maybe if Kingmaker was fully voiced it'd be different, but that game has a lot of text
[2:08:35] <krionik77> you passed it.
[2:08:38] <+Greenkap> yes
[2:08:38] <SaltyAzteca> Blind
[2:08:39] <%Ne1son> psaBlind

[2:09:29] <+twohitgood> that's neat
[2:09:34] <krionik77> yeah, some of the weapons get crazy stuff added onto em.
[2:09:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> man this mod is really great but I don't wanna souls myself out before the big E
[2:09:43] <%epide> yeah the devs should have just made there own game
[2:09:50] <Azmodem> cumvergence
[2:09:51] <krionik77> I like the morion weapons in this game a lot.
[2:09:55] <DXLelouch24> You can counter damage enemys with that
[2:09:57] <+FelIian> brizziBlind
[2:10:09] <SubjectX07x> Jeez, this is making me wanna go through my NG+ run of convergence.
[2:10:12] <BliVru> Lets make a drinking game: take a shot everytime you see a Sekiro asset
[2:10:20] <Azmodem> Cast tree
[2:10:35] <Saturation_Lizard> @BliVru pls no
[2:10:47] <krionik77> you gotta remember to kill that boss again if yoy want the bonfire down there.
[2:10:56] <SaltyAzteca> Makes sense
[2:10:57] <+mmack093> lol
[2:11:01] <%cooldude69xx> base game didnt either
[2:11:03] <%oda_flobunaga> Take a drink everytime you see a reused asset from a Fromsoft game
[2:11:04] <piknick_> water surge was my nickname in high school
[2:11:06] <SaltyAzteca> YA GOTTA EARN IT

[2:11:31] <krionik77> Water surge is only kinda okay unfortunately...
[2:11:36] <%TheDullaMAN> Hey Pat, finally getting to see what Convergence looks like, how's it play?
[2:11:41] <piknick_> @piknick_ exactly
[2:11:42] <%KeiganOfAstora> What is Pat wearing?
[2:12:07] <%TheDullaMAN> A shirt.
[2:12:10] <SubjectX07x> Dark magic is genuinely broken tbh, necromancy especially having some really dumb end game spells.
[2:12:14] <@Ranryu692> wolf head
[2:12:15] <KaiserMario> Mdir Dark Eater vs 100 Undead with pointy logs
[2:12:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> Do you progress through the areas in the same order as the vanilla game?
[2:12:17] <krionik77> he's wearing a mishmash of some armor he got from the druid tree and the basic druid set.
[2:12:29] <krionik77> Lowers costs of spells and whatnot.
[2:12:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> What game is this set from?
[2:12:47] <+UltraViolet371> does Paige have an existing Rise character yet or are we doing tutorials on saturday?
[2:12:50] <Sapientiae> was that a thwomp noise?
[2:13:04] <SubjectX07x> Things such as "Double your HP, increased stamina regen, +20% damage, only downside you use HP to cast spells, also has no time limit"
[2:13:07] <+mmack093> dunked
[2:13:07] <OptimumPride> LUL
[2:13:09] <+Catpurnicus> YEEEEEEEEE
[2:13:09] <Gelphaze> Smashed!
[2:13:10] <$Trenr> what's that smell
[2:13:11] <SaltyAzteca> FROM THE TOP ROPE
[2:13:12] <+twohitgood> uhhhh
[2:13:13] <churropoppa> LUL
[2:13:13] <wasdsf> DOWN B
[2:13:13] <%TheDullaMAN> Could I play a Belmont in this Mod?
[2:13:14] <%tank7013> Well alright then
[2:13:15] <%cooldude69xx> Damn, this swamp was not built for this many shadows
[2:13:16] <krionik77> He literally dunked on you.
[2:13:16] <+Catpurnicus> fuckin yeah
[2:13:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> This area looks like shit with this lighting
[2:13:22] <%StephanieSadGirl> LUL
[2:13:24] <T_Sasquatch> Fuck those cross bearing red eyed trolls
[2:13:24] <+Catpurnicus> I was just going to ask where that dude was
[2:13:27] <+A_Fistful_of_Bees> Watch out watch out watch out!
[2:13:27] <%chiazam> I wanted to ask if Pat was overpowered and unbalanced but that seemed fair
[2:13:57] <SubjectX07x> @chiazam You can become stupid broken in this mod, he's relatively reasonable by comparison.
[2:14:02] <%Agami23> pat probably needs to level his health lol
[2:14:04] <+TheBitingIrish> waow
[2:14:08] <wasdsf> I swear I thought he came out of the fucking sky
[2:14:08] <SubjectX07x> His best thing is the DOT spam it seems.
[2:14:20] <krionik77> Yeah, this is one area i actually think looks worse with the lighting changes, but it seems like kind of the point.
[2:14:50] <%AoiRob> oh hey you can do druid infusions now neat
[2:15:01] <wasdsf> there he is
[2:15:04] <%FacetiousAF> this just seems like huge massive fun
[2:15:16] <%StephanieSadGirl> Fight him!  dont coward out!
[2:15:17] <%AoiRob> *menacing*
[2:15:21] <@GeneralSCPatton> I feel like Cinders might have been inspired by this, with their somewhat recent addition of some ice and blood magic.
[2:15:23] <SaltyAzteca> he's just standing there menacingly
[2:15:25] <krionik77> the old wolf is in the open area if you'd like to say hi.
[2:15:56] <%AoiRob> wow good thing he has like no poise
[2:16:09] <%chiazam> I just knew there had to be another one
[2:16:28] <%RetroCop87> HE'S GOT NO STYLE
[2:16:31] <KaiserMario> What's the name of this build? It makes me think of Spawn with all that green magic
[2:16:33] <%chiazam> Fight!
[2:16:41] <tanarath> Sketti. make the sketti
[2:16:43] <SaltyAzteca> Lizard cant even sleep in peace
[2:16:50] <krionik77> druid build.
[2:16:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @KaiserMario it's a starting class, druid
[2:17:01] <KaiserMario> druid!
[2:17:09] <KaiserMario> cool
[2:17:10] <%maskofmichael> I missed it, do it again
[2:17:14] <DianaTheAscian> WOW
[2:17:34] <krionik77> good shit.
[2:17:36] <wasdsf> the full sound doesnt even play
[2:17:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that almost looks like a gauntlet
[2:18:04] <BliVru> @patstaresat u can do a magic sword build with that shield too
[2:18:10] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Equip shield on right hand
[2:18:17] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Jesus, how much content is actually in this mod?
[2:18:32] <krionik77> just have the item in a second slot on the left hand, you'd still have the effect.
[2:18:40] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt For shooting
[2:18:57] <BliVru> no it doesnt
[2:19:01] <%Agami23> that way you can change to it for shooting
[2:19:12] <Mirrorcatch> 2nd staff in left just for flame arc?
[2:19:16] <%AoiRob> nah just leave it like that
[2:19:24] <TGKodama> Loving the new lighting on the bog
[2:19:30] <KaiserMario> I'm smart, S-M-R-T
[2:19:35] <%Agami23> theres some swords that work as catalysts that it would be useful for
[2:19:39] <%AoiRob> nice
[2:19:41] <SaltyAzteca> YO
[2:19:51] <%jaco_checkbox> you've got the contra gun
[2:19:52] <@GeneralSCPatton> Are there options if I want a life leech caster build?
[2:19:57] <SaltyAzteca> Thats a little busted LUL
[2:20:21] <%AoiRob> @GeneralSCPatton Blood Miracles
[2:20:21] <krionik77> yeah, dark miracles @GeneralSCPatton.
[2:20:26] <%Agami23> @GeneralSCPatton yeah, bloodguard is all about that
[2:20:26] <Saturation_Lizard> @GeneralSCPatton yes, blood magic is that entirely
[2:20:27] <boostergoldz> yes blood miracles can leech
[2:20:31] <%tank7013> The mod does add stuff for normal fighting but it's pretty clear that the focus was magic
[2:20:49] <%Agami23> you use HP for blood miracles but also some are all about draining HP
[2:21:11] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's pretty fast
[2:21:13] <KaiserMario> it's a polarm
[2:21:13] <+TheBitingIrish> NotLikeThis
[2:21:15] <KaiserMario> polearm
[2:21:16] <krionik77> yeah, a bunch of the physically oriented stuff has new effects or added affinities on them now.
[2:21:29] <%Agami23> i think it scales more with strength
[2:21:34] <+trackles_64> so whats been the biggest difference in this mod from regular dark souls?

[2:23:27] <%StephanieSadGirl> lol what
[2:23:28] <KaiserMario> wow, what a noob
[2:23:31] <%AoiRob> @kinkade_77 there are some BUSTED weapons in this
[2:23:35] <%Agami23> i regot all the achivements
[2:23:36] <tolloponik> its pretty out of the way
[2:23:47] <+Havictos> @AoiRob Like what?
[2:23:48] <Razeino> The dog was selling items
[2:23:54] <%RetroCop87> Is the bitrate slow for anyone else?
[2:23:56] <%RealThiele> time for that iconic hat
[2:23:59] <KaiserMario> On the base game I had some fun with the Wolf Curved sword
[2:24:01] <krionik77> you can just get artorius' armor from him now.
[2:24:36] <+Havictos> that lizard is dumb as shit
[2:24:44] <%AoiRob> i remember the Pontiff weapons and Abyss Watcher weapons doing crazy shit
[2:24:55] <IminyourBase> love me some Darnell Souls 3
[2:25:01] <%tusk102> safer too since they dont come back if they die unless you sit
[2:25:05] <kinkade_77> does elden ring have mp regen
[2:25:10] <%tusk102> cuz it sucks
[2:25:12] <+trackles_64> cause it sucks
[2:25:17] <krionik77> it really isn't.
[2:25:20] <Latija> there's no iron ring in ds3 right?
[2:25:22] <BliVru> its almost like its shit
[2:25:29] <dan_g_v> what happened to dishonored, chat peoples?
[2:25:31] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt I'm glad you took my advice for right hand shield, just be careful not to buff the shield accidentally LUL
[2:25:33] <+Havictos> oh yeah these dudes are fun
[2:25:41] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I like the challenge
[2:25:43] <krionik77> Place your bets everyone, will elden ring have another poison swamp?
[2:25:46] <%tusk102> there is no ring in ds3 for movement @Latija
[2:25:47] <Profmcstevie> Nice twirl loser
[2:25:51] <%oda_flobunaga> Imagine if there is an entire region of Elden Ring with the water penalty
[2:25:52] <krionik77> look at the shop on the wolf.
[2:25:58] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> How long did dishonored last?
[2:25:58] <%RealThiele> spin 2 slow
[2:25:58] <%StephanieSadGirl> This area made it exceptionally not fun, cause PVPers would just invade and sit in the water shooting at you, making you deal with them, crabs AND fuckin water movement
[2:26:03] <+Havictos> was it a swamp tho
[2:26:04] <Latija> @krionik77 it will have multiple for sure
[2:26:04] <NireFuster> There will be TWO swamps
[2:26:05] <%AoiRob> @kinkade_77 we dont know if there's gear for that
[2:26:07] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Not very I bet
[2:26:13] <+treebeard24> either get rid of the movement penalty or make it apply to the enemies too, otherwise its stupid
[2:26:14] <tolloponik> its going to have 10
[2:26:15] <+trackles_64> will a fromsoft game hava poison area OMEGALUL
[2:26:18] <%Shonen_hero> there's always gotta be like one poison infested shit hole
[2:26:20] <Razeino> If I could have the rusted iron ring or the movement penalty was half. I wouldn't mind it.
[2:26:20] <%LaughingCatt> it is likely Elden Ring will have MULTIPLE poison swamps
[2:26:23] <tanarath> @dan_g_v pat's brain is drained, missing the rune at the end of the last stream didn't help, and the level he started was super complex.
[2:26:25] <DianaTheAscian> I hope the moonlight gs is in elden ring
[2:26:33] <KaiserMario> Elden Ring has a Poison Swamp, a fire zone, an ice zone... y'know... the usual
[2:26:38] <%oda_flobunaga> 2/3s of Elden Ring's map will kill you to be in it
[2:26:41] <VirtuallyCanadian> swamp is required
[2:26:44] <NireFuster> It's going to be in the game for sure yeah
[2:26:49] <%tusk102> it would be more weird if it wasnt
[2:26:49] <%SharkMissile> Wait...was it in Sekiro?
[2:26:49] <Treasure_Vault> @DianaTheAscian The moonlight ultra ultragreatsword
[2:26:50] <+trackles_64> I hope patches is in elden ring
[2:26:51] <+vanareus> food world
[2:26:51] <%Shonen_hero> but will Patches be in Elden Ring?
[2:26:52] <+Havictos> It's been in EVERY FromSoft game
[2:26:58] <%doomunderthestairs> thing has been in since armored cored
[2:27:00] <%Glass_Muffin> Yo this fart magic is dank as shit @PatStaresAt
[2:27:04] <+Havictos> Except Sekiro I think?
[2:27:05] <dan_g_v> @tanarath thanks!
[2:27:06] <%doomunderthestairs> even earlier
[2:27:08] <krionik77> there are some nice moonlight spells and weapons in this mod as well, captain yorshka has some stuff in this mod.
[2:27:11] <Zombrocom> Moonlight GS was in sekiro but you couldn't use it
[2:27:12] <NireFuster> Will Seath be in Elden Ring?
[2:27:13] <kinkade_77> it wasnt in sekiro right
[2:27:18] <boostergoldz> i'm more excited for new armored core
[2:27:22] <%Dapper_Cactuar> Dapper_Cactuar subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! ended up showing a friend the clip of the podcast from a while back where you talk about Kai Leng and remembered something. It's even worse than you think, they drummed him up in advertising for months before launch
[2:27:22] <DianaTheAscian> both of then not being in Sekrio was kinda disappointing
[2:27:23] <%tusk102> moonlight is a safer bet than patches tbf
[2:27:25] <%doomunderthestairs> a solairesque type kinda guy too
[2:27:26] <Zombrocom> The divine dragon wields it
[2:27:28] <+trackles_64> Will Onion Bro bein Elden Ring?
[2:27:29] <Latija> Sekiro has a mini poison swamp
[2:27:30] <@GeneralSCPatton> I bet the Moonlight GS is the activation key for the Halo which will turn out to be the true Elden ring all along.
[2:27:33] <%Zundelle> Patches will trap you in a poison swamp area that takes 6 hours to find your way out of
[2:27:39] <CptHarlok> What do you think about the Armored Core 6 leaks?  I'm pretty hype, myself.
[2:27:40] <%RealThiele> but will 8-ball be there too?
[2:27:48] <superlit_1> I hope patches is in the new armored core.
[2:27:50] <%oda_flobunaga> Pot bro is the new Onion Knight
[2:27:52] <%Shonen_hero> Kai Leng just looks like a shittier Nightwing
[2:27:52] <%greasypete00> and there are always the spoilers that you can look up and probably confirm stuff for youself if youre into that
[2:27:52] <Treasure_Vault> Patches VA is a 3rd Dan blackbelt
[2:27:53] <NireFuster> Goddamn those enemies are aggressive as fuck
[2:27:55] <+Havictos> @doomunderthestairs Dude it's been in since Kingsfield
[2:27:56] <KaiserMario> You know you're playing a FROM soft game when the skeletons have the stand up animation where they put their heads on
[2:27:58] <+trackles_64> Will Solaire be in Elden Ring?
[2:27:58] <krionik77> Swaamp.
[2:27:59] <DeltaPangaea> I'm reeaaally hopeful for AC6
[2:28:14] <BarnYardFiddler> The game will be like MGS4. Filled to the brim with fan service
[2:28:18] <%Glass_Muffin> Replaying Dark souls 1 and I cannot believe how ass the Bed of Chaos is. @PatStaresAt It is so AWFUL
[2:28:18] <NireFuster> I can barely hear Pat over the screams LUL

[2:28:42] <TerrifyingRei_05> It's an honest living
[2:28:49] <%Shonen_hero> He loots all the loser who die in the super dungeon and sells it to you
[2:28:52] <%doomunderthestairs> woolieONEGUY
[2:28:57] <TerrifyingRei_05> CRAB

[2:29:10] <NireFuster> :(
[2:29:15] <krionik77> Those things that screech at you in irithyll dungeon are still the worst.
[2:29:20] <DeltaPangaea> Art thou feeling it now, Mr Krabs?
[2:29:30] <+trackles_64> its cause theres no light
[2:29:36] <%shurtal> why is it that i've yet to find an honestly bad lucking gun for machinist in 14?
[2:29:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah it looks really nice actually
[2:29:38] <%Shonen_hero> I like how you can fuck with that guy and call him out about being a lying vulture, and he'll change his name to Real Honest Guy
[2:29:39] <%Tearonex> This area looks so much cooler in this light
[2:29:45] <+twohitgood> or flynn ring
[2:29:49] <%jaco_checkbox> the water looks too clean
[2:29:49] <%FacetiousAF> not everything needs a change @elmo

[2:30:35] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> because their stick is really big
[2:30:39] <%cvp5127> @PatStaresAt any plans to look at the bloodborne demake at the end of the month
[2:30:40] <KaiserMario> Martin Lawrence?!
[2:30:47] <%oda_flobunaga> Once you go black knight you never go back knight
[2:31:10] <krionik77> I forgot about that.
[2:31:11] <%SharkMissile> @PatStaresAt Do you think you'll play REmake 1?
[2:31:14] <+trackles_64> asfalll

[2:31:39] <+twohitgood> nightfall mod?
[2:31:41] <%RealThiele> ash dog
[2:31:42] <%Buttlo> It would be a lot better if it was called Assfall though.
[2:31:43] <T_Sasquatch> Wut
[2:31:44] <BigYanno> Ash Fuc
[2:31:44] <KaiserMario> wut?
[2:31:46] <%AJ_Cherenkov> Well, there's still one big DS mod that's easy to remember the name of. Dark Souls: Remastest
[2:31:47] <%AoiRob> @PatStaresAt Nightfall. it's a demo coming out. the full release will be after Elden Ring
[2:31:49] <@GeneralSCPatton> Any opinions on that Castlevania War of 99 fan game, aside from "they should shut up"?
[2:31:49] <DXLelouch24> Nightfalls next Week?!
[2:31:50] <Treasure_Vault> @oda_flobunaga once you go black knight you won't keep your back tight
[2:31:50] <%oda_flobunaga> so, DS2?
[2:31:54] <+twohitgood> i can't wait until someone does bloodborne 2 in DS3.
[2:31:54] <+Havictos> so Darks Souls 2 2?
[2:31:56] <Gabbycat> just got here, why does the title say he changed his mind? o: was he not gonna play this after the first part?
[2:32:08] <tolloponik> that sounds like it can get in bad fan-fiction territory
[2:32:09] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:32:10] <superlit_1> dark souls 1 part 2
[2:32:20] <%RealThiele> zapzap
[2:32:22] <krionik77> Yeah, there are like at least 5 or six of these covenant spots.
[2:32:32] <krionik77> Bonfire's at the bottom of the ladder.
[2:32:36] <%pokefan9956> @PatStaresAt like your ass?
[2:32:38] <T_Sasquatch> @gabbycat he backed down on dishonored
[2:32:41] <%pokefan9956> dark and wide open
[2:32:49] <KaiserMario> I know the game says Filianore is Gwyn's secret daughter, but I always thought it'd made more sense if it was his wife, y'know?
[2:32:53] <%tank7013> @Gabbycat The original plan for the night was Dishonored dlc but he just can't brain stealth right now
[2:32:55] <Gabbycat> ah thanku
[2:33:01] <NireFuster> Can you smell what the Peach is cooking?!
[2:33:04] <%luckysteak> luckysteak subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months, currently on a 36 month streak! Hey Pat. Thank you for being a funny gremlin. Here is more money so that you may perform for my/our amusement

[2:33:23] <%shurtal> meatloaf?
[2:33:23] <%AoiRob> @PatStaresAt it's called Nightfall. they delayed it put they're still releasing a demo this month
[2:33:25] <%RealThiele> big staminas
[2:33:33] <@Ranryu692> chicago style "pizza"?
[2:33:44] <@ssjklyco> You should order shitty hot dogs and put it on the hotdogs
[2:33:46] <KaiserMario> Knightfall? Like BATMAN?
[2:33:52] <DianaTheAscian> good
[2:33:56] <%SharkMissile> No creb? :(
[2:33:58] <RickyRelucent> pat is anational treasure

[2:34:07] <%SharkMissile> {V};,,,;(V)
[2:34:09] <KaiserMario> Is bane gonna break the undead spine?
[2:34:09] <@GeneralSCPatton> I bet they fused them into one GIGA CRAB
[2:34:17] <DeltaPangaea> I miss Biggo Crabbo
[2:34:21] <Profmcstevie> Crustacean Removal is wrong
[2:34:22] <Gabbycat> just now too lol
[2:34:27] <%FacetiousAF> the real final boss: giant enemy crab
[2:34:27] <@Ranryu692> do you think they'll put Miura in Elden Ring as an NPC?
[2:34:28] <Treasure_Vault> @KaiserMario I always figured Velka for his wife. Fits the Izanagi/Izanami mythos.
[2:34:35] <BliVru> @patstaresat No crabs cuz FF7 Remake came out
[2:34:40] <%Daziggedey> Wait they delayed nightfall a second time?
[2:34:41] <%tank7013> Watch that be the area boss. The Royal Crab Authority or some shit
[2:34:45] <krionik77> it always seemed weird that crabs would hang out in a swamp.
[2:34:49] <%oda_flobunaga> CRAB BATTUL
[2:35:07] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt By the way I'm finishing up the four lords stuff before completing Endwalker and I didn't care for it. Especially when it treats you like your a baby that can't beat some dumb glowing horse and haven't been stomping every god being that comes your way.
[2:35:09] <+aWanderingKaivo> good ole dark souls attacks through walls
[2:35:11] <@Ranryu692> in the forest LUL
[2:35:12] <%luckysteak> in the ocean
[2:35:13] <%LaughingCatt> in the castle duh
[2:35:14] <%cade_calrayn> Crabtown
[2:35:14] <KaiserMario> @Treasure_Vault Makes sense! But they could also be the same goddess right? after all filianore is is in Londor
[2:35:14] <+aWanderingKaivo> or, well, trees
[2:35:14] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> a beach
[2:35:14] <Jim_Placebo> THE BEACH, PAT
[2:35:16] <DianaTheAscian> somewhere nicer
[2:35:18] <+Havictos> You're
[2:35:26] <RickyRelucent> desert crabs
[2:35:27] <@ssjklyco> A swamp is basically a dirty beach
[2:35:28] <boostergoldz> crabville
[2:35:30] <jkips56> There’s a bonfire back by that magic guy
[2:35:30] <%pokefan9956> what if instead of miura's assistants finishing berserk, fromsoft did
[2:35:33] <%pokefan9956> like, as a game
[2:35:38] <susukouhai> But mud crabs exist
[2:35:46] <wibbwobbler> beaches
[2:35:48] <krionik77> idk, a beach, the ocean, speaking of, there are very few oceanside areas in souls, except in ds2
[2:35:50] <cosmicgoatee> Why is there a Red Lobster, but not a Blue Crab, it makes no sense
[2:36:05] <+glassesaregod> Since everything is slowly becoming crabs anyway, I expect to see crabs inhabiting every known habitat one day
[2:36:10] <%bravebravesrobin> you ever hit the part at work where you're like: "I'm getting drunk as fuck tonight"? Cheer500
[2:36:11] <RickyRelucent> now im thinking of some  asian pastry shaped like a crystacean
[2:36:15] <+gnomedraws> It's BS lycanthrope hunters don't aggro lycanthropes
[2:36:21] <%oda_flobunaga> I think Koei Techmo's got the Berserk game rights though
[2:36:23] <%StephanieSadGirl> @cosmicgoatee Cause its Red Lobster and Blue Waffle house
[2:36:23] <+twohitgood> bob and weave
[2:36:24] <%jaco_checkbox> crossified
[2:36:26] <%FacetiousAF> that's the dark souls
[2:36:27] <Jim_Placebo> You got him!
[2:36:28] <cosmicgoatee> Death Crabbing, a Hideo Crabjima Game
[2:36:28] <krionik77> insult to injury mad.
[2:36:34] <%TheDullaMAN> At least you gottem
[2:36:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> man I'm completely lost in this swamp with the lighting change, weird but cool
[2:36:37] <+rafaelba93> crabs are cool tho
[2:36:38] <KaiserMario> Damn Pat... maybe you should Paige to coach you on how to play gud
[2:36:48] <+aWanderingKaivo> shoulda used your axe?
[2:37:15] <IminyourBase> that's unsettling
[2:37:18] <%tank7013> That's really goofy
[2:37:18] <%AJ_Cherenkov> neat
[2:37:23] <IminyourBase> i hate that
[2:37:25] <%oda_flobunaga> Berserk Musou 2: THE BOAT
[2:37:27] <DianaTheAscian> this is goofy
[2:37:35] <%FacetiousAF> coulda been so cool maybe
[2:37:44] <krionik77> sometimes the sound is real glitchy in this mod, spell is also really lame.
[2:37:46] <KaiserMario> Oh man, blood orb?
[2:37:48] <boostergoldz> hydro pump is pretty good once you have the stats for it
[2:37:49] <Treasure_Vault> I really hoped you'd get the snap hound as a spell.
[2:37:53] <%GIGA255> Fart gas staff
[2:37:57] <kikoeru_san> hey chat did Pat take a stab at Archdragon Peak yet
[2:38:11] <%GIGA255> Silent but deadly
[2:38:17] <krionik77> he saw it, didn't go very far.
[2:38:19] <%FacetiousAF> @kikoeru_san he was there for like 10 seconds and noped
[2:38:23] <Profmcstevie> But he was so fast for a stationary person D:
[2:38:26] <+aWanderingKaivo> he went there last stream and noped out because low lvl
[2:38:26] <%StephanieSadGirl> That doggy is a very good doggy, how dere you say mean things about them
[2:38:27] <kinkade_77> summoners are always the coolest
[2:38:36] <%RealThiele> cinders had better pet AI imo
[2:38:36] <+Havictos> why does it keep running back to you instead of attacking sometimes?
[2:38:37] <krionik77> why don't you use embers more pat?
[2:38:40] <kikoeru_san> Good because the new boss there is EVIL
[2:38:43] <RickyRelucent> the only cool crab i know is rither misterxravs,  or kuraba thf fiddler crab medabot
[2:38:44] <NireFuster> I can smell it through the screen, it's good
[2:38:48] <Profmcstevie> pasta sandwich

[2:40:00] <sapphomet777> i love u paige
[2:40:03] <%GIGA255> She must be there by your side to make sure you do it right.

[2:40:36] <sapphomet777> theres Rage of Africa but then theres Chad of Africa, peach
[2:40:38] <Ell1ot> sometimes i keep opening and closing the fridge until my standards are lowered
[2:40:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> When she's done with the beer she dons the wife beater, and that's when the fun starts
[2:40:46] <cosmicgoatee> that makes Pat the virgin if Paige is the Chad LUL
[2:40:46] <RickyRelucent> i meant queen as in set in her eay but that wiorks
[2:40:55] <IminyourBase> devour hurty sand, crush can
[2:40:56] <RickyRelucent> pat the scarlet kang
[2:40:56] <Profmcstevie> Crushes the beer can against her forehead, calls the hospital and says she has severe bleeding, very chad
[2:41:04] <NireFuster> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ Implying she ever takes it off
[2:41:05] <krionik77> Now you need to talk to druid man for next upgrade materials.
[2:41:24] <%za7az> Hey chat, just got here. What did I miss?
[2:41:25] <%crimsonharvest> drinks an entire thing of malk
[2:41:29] <sapphomet777> Pat baby! Eat hurty sand! Vore beer!
[2:41:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @NireFuster touche
[2:42:00] <RickyRelucent> ppl beibg set xan ve a good thing just like not being set
[2:42:06] <boostergoldz> the blue ones
[2:42:20] <%za7az> @sapphomet777 Sounds intense! Sad I missed it
[2:42:20] <IminyourBase> someone put their dark souls OC in as an NPC
[2:42:26] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat In regular DS3 what a good magice to use?
[2:42:35] <%GIGA255> All druids should be named Drew
[2:42:47] <boostergoldz> that's what you use the hollow/soldier's remains on
[2:42:48] <KaiserMario> interesting or just weird?
[2:42:49] <%Agami23> or ed
[2:42:59] <boostergoldz> and you can just grind them if you want
[2:43:00] <krionik77> yeah, and in order to get those you use the items you get from fighting bosses. kind of gives a reason for grinding.
[2:43:18] <%Agami23> soldiers remains are from bosses
[2:43:19] <breadsbred> @za7az some Dishonoured and we've been on DS for maybe 30 minds so far
[2:43:21] <KaiserMario> from dead people
[2:43:23] <+aWanderingKaivo> I think you got them from bosses before?
[2:43:23] <%GIGA255> No thats alchemists
[2:43:25] <glass_marcus> bosses
[2:43:32] <%Agami23> like bosses around your current difficulty
[2:43:33] <BliVru> Alchemist covenant drops it
[2:43:33] <+twohitgood> bosses like the druid guy
[2:43:34] <krionik77> fight bosses, that's kind of what the kindled colosseum is for.
[2:43:42] <BliVru> no wait im wrong
[2:43:46] <%Agami23> weak bosses give hollows remains, then soldiers, then so on
[2:43:47] <glass_marcus> the stronger the boss the better the remains
[2:43:50] <%RealThiele> soldiers romaines
[2:43:54] <%FacetiousAF> archdruid?!
[2:43:54] <%shurtal> fight that smelly old swamp man
[2:43:55] <+aWanderingKaivo> Caimar is hype
[2:43:55] <%AoiRob> bosses and minibosses
[2:43:55] <%Agami23> slap the druids ass
[2:44:02] <%epide> PAT GET EM
[2:44:03] <KaiserMario> Druid man is cool
[2:44:06] <%FacetiousAF> FUCK HIM UP
[2:44:08] <ape_hawk> seem?
[2:44:17] <boostergoldz> you should do decent damage now
[2:44:20] <+aWanderingKaivo> he's rad as hell though so its excused
[2:44:21] <krionik77> early bosses have hollow, early to mid have soldier, near endgame has knight, and endgame and dlc have champion's remains.
[2:44:23] <%FacetiousAF> get his aaaasssss
[2:44:38] <%GIGA255> Drude where's my car?
[2:44:47] <%Agami23> he'll give you more souls which is always good
[2:44:48] <+rafaelba93> they are
[2:44:54] <+Havictos> ?!
[2:44:58] <ape_hawk> convergence? more like comf-ergence
[2:44:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> once you get to know them they're really chill
[2:44:59] <arkv01> the what in who's butt now?
[2:45:03] <Oak_bogle> Druid sandstorm
[2:45:03] <%FacetiousAF> lotta balls in one singular ass
[2:45:04] <+embranz> DS games are very atmospheric
[2:45:04] <NireFuster> "TITS UP MY ASS! BALLS!"
[2:45:08] <+tempestzephyr> Balls in her ass
[2:45:09] <+liquidzr0> shofuDisgust
[2:45:11] <RickyRelucent> anything ur good at is gonn as comfort u
[2:45:11] <+aWanderingKaivo> especially when you are very familiar with them it makes sense
[2:45:12] <+Havictos> better not lose
[2:45:18] <viewtifulr> ballin
[2:45:25] <+Havictos> or paige will laugh at you
[2:45:34] <DXLelouch24> Round 2
[2:45:37] <%CapnBeefs> Yo this dude is cool
[2:45:42] <KaiserMario> He's a mix of Owl and Gundyr?
[2:45:43] <NireFuster> And she will call him a pussy too LUL
[2:45:49] <%pokefan9956> I thought pat beat this dude
[2:45:49] <%greasypete00> do they get stronger when resummoned?
[2:45:54] <%GIGA255> Hot druid on druid action.
[2:46:03] <+liquidzr0> getloSlide
[2:46:14] <+xcompleasedad> How many Archdruid fights are there?
[2:46:21] <blue8moon> that snap he does to summon his doggo is cool
[2:46:21] <krionik77> remember that your shield boosts spellcasting speed..
[2:46:24] <NireFuster> Almost
[2:46:28] <+TheBitingIrish> ????
[2:46:29] <%RetroCop87> Pat, you have the same bullshit
[2:46:30] <DXLelouch24> As many as you want
[2:46:30] <+aWanderingKaivo> got landed on and casted on immediately
[2:46:32] <NireFuster> Yeah the snap is super awesome
[2:46:34] <+TheBitingIrish> oh
[2:46:36] <%CapnBeefs> Dang, this is a cool boss fight
[2:46:37] <%StephanieSadGirl> @blue8moon Right?
[2:46:42] <DXLelouch24> Can refiggt bosses
[2:46:44] <KaiserMario> You know what's bullshit? Power adapters!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[2:46:48] <%RetroCop87> oh yeah, that's legit bs
[2:46:49] <+polothegreatest> he thanos u
[2:46:52] <DXLelouch24> Refight*
[2:46:52] <NireFuster> Reminds me of Urbosa snapping lightning on BOTW
[2:46:55] <concerned_dm> @xcompleasedad just the one, but you can re fight bosses whenever
[2:47:00] <%GIGA255> He had more pokemon than you
[2:47:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Never let a druid catch you meaty
[2:47:07] <NewWillinium> .......This is a Sekiro boss aint it?
[2:47:10] <Profmcstevie> Because his aggro to start is based on distance, I wonder if you could slam up a bunch of wisps and get cheeky damage
[2:47:19] <boostergoldz> i'm pretty sure you can roll as you hit the ground in the phase change to get control back a bit quicker
[2:47:24] <+aWanderingKaivo> oh the wolf is poison too
[2:47:28] <+aWanderingKaivo> of course
[2:47:31] <KaiserMario> @NewWillinium There's some Gundyr in there too
[2:47:33] <+Havictos> @NewWillinium It's owl's moveset from Sekiro
[2:47:33] <Melchior_the_Wise> better than treeballs already
[2:47:34] <RickyRelucent> omg he has B O I wolves
[2:47:36] <%Agami23> it sucks that the two coolest things he has you cant get from him
[2:48:05] <Treasure_Vault> One day a modder will put every knight-sized enemy attack on one dude.
[2:48:09] <%oda_flobunaga> Treeballs is the Bed of Chaos but as a functional boss
[2:48:11] <%GIGA255> Cursed rotted manhood
[2:48:14] <boostergoldz> the wolf snap should be a spell you can use
[2:48:22] <HeroToxiko> ooh green
[2:48:29] <HeroToxiko> YAAAS BIIITCH
[2:48:38] <NireFuster> I hope Elden Ring will have cool shit like the snapping thing
[2:48:44] <%shurtal> time to grind Bardam's Mettle
[2:48:53] <keohtv> oh hey! I heard you talking about this on Castle Super Beast today!
[2:48:55] <HeroToxiko> did he just snap a deer at you?
[2:48:58] <DianaTheAscian> wow
[2:49:00] <AllenDeadman> nice
[2:49:00] <%twoto858> Nice@
[2:49:02] <krionik77> congrats.
[2:49:06] <%FacetiousAF> @HeroToxiko issa wolf
[2:49:16] <%GIGA255> You drud it!
[2:49:17] <HeroToxiko> @HeroToxiko makes sense
[2:49:18] <DeltaPangaea> Dunked 'em
[2:49:24] <%oda_flobunaga> What if Elden Ring on release has Nioh's loot system
[2:49:31] <krionik77> and you can get some levels too if you want. fighting the watchdog is a good way to grind.
[2:49:41] <%chiazam> Do invasions work with mods?
[2:49:42] <Profmcstevie> feral Deer
[2:49:54] <KaiserMario> Do the ressurected bosses scale as you progress, or can you stomp them at the end of the game?
[2:49:58] <@ssjklyco> Eating peanut butter from the pouch is great.
[2:49:59] <boostergoldz> they do
[2:50:01] <%RaziWraith> that would be a helluva change from the beta LUL
[2:50:01] <keohtv> @chiazam Yes, but you have to have a work around.
[2:50:04] <%Agami23> i dont think they work for this, but they do work for cinders
[2:50:07] <+Havictos> They might if you're banned
[2:50:07] <%FacetiousAF> 25 Kreygasm
[2:50:10] <krionik77> most of the time you get banned if playing online with mods.
[2:50:13] <%tank7013> You can play online but you need to manually re-enable it and you're gonna end up in cheater jail
[2:50:20] <+aWanderingKaivo> the default for mods is to turn your online off iirc
[2:50:21] <+trackles_64> People just beg for loot in dakr souls forum on steam
[2:50:21] <NireFuster> Woooooooah
[2:50:26] <MechanizedGentleman> pee stream
[2:50:27] <boostergoldz> i invade people all the time playing cinders. on my side of the connection their weapons and spells are invisible.
[2:50:28] <%oda_flobunaga> ewwwww
[2:50:33] <+Havictos> no water sounds FeelsBadMan
[2:50:36] <%CapnBeefs> GEYSER!!!!!!
[2:50:37] <keohtv> The way to get around getting your main account banned from DkS3 is to make a second account and family share the game to it to play online.
[2:50:40] <%oda_flobunaga> Jizz Cannon
[2:50:41] <KaiserMario> Firefighter Druid build
[2:50:45] <krionik77> good for large enemies.
[2:50:55] <NireFuster> GET FUCKED
[2:50:58] <ohno778> PAT BEEEEEEEAMU
[2:51:00] <+aWanderingKaivo> ok that's better lol
[2:51:00] <%FacetiousAF> hydromancy
[2:51:01] <+trackles_64> thats insane
[2:51:03] <NireFuster> PogChamp
[2:51:04] <xerotwo> FamilyMan OOP AHH FamilyMan
[2:51:05] <@GeneralSCPatton> That is some busted ass stagger
[2:51:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> now TAHAT'S much better
[2:51:06] <%tank7013> Looks fun to troll with
[2:51:07] <@Lion_kun> yooooooooo
[2:51:07] <%doomunderthestairs> damn that stagger
[2:51:15] <krionik77> yeah, you have to line it up right.
[2:51:21] <keohtv> what is that DoT damage tho!
[2:51:22] <boostergoldz> just don't shoot it on stairs
[2:51:22] <HeroToxiko> PogBones
[2:51:24] <KaiserMario> On big bosses that looks really strong
[2:51:26] <keohtv> that's insane!\
[2:51:31] <DeltaPangaea> "Oh good the spell I was looking forward to isn't trashbad."
[2:51:33] <+aWanderingKaivo> its sort of like a mini version of that big charge up spell from vanilla
[2:51:33] <krionik77> exactly like that.
[2:51:41] <+aWanderingKaivo> soul stream
[2:51:42] <HeroToxiko> yeah
[2:51:51] <%CapnBeefs> Essence strike still seems more useful
[2:52:01] <Profmcstevie> Soul Stream but you can cast and walk away
[2:52:09] <%Agami23> dont forget that you can also learn non druid sorceries. like that oolacile lightning garbage
[2:52:12] <+TheMeromex> how does it do agains groups?
[2:52:19] <keohtv> im happy you dont one shot stuff in this mod like you could in cinders
[2:52:19] <boostergoldz> that's a thing with big hitbox move
[2:52:25] <krionik77> That's why i say it's only kind of okay, because most of the tougher enemies don't stay still or stagger enough to be truly effective.
[2:52:29] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Is big fat stony boy still alive? he'd be a good test for this
[2:52:32] <DianaTheAscian> LUL
[2:52:38] <DracaenaLeaf> the flashing on the water is weird
[2:52:44] <HeroToxiko> get stunlocked
[2:53:07] <Profmcstevie> every stony boy I love dies sugoiSadguts
[2:53:12] <%oda_flobunaga> JIZZ Cannon
[2:53:13] <DeltaPangaea> Yeah the visual effect is kind of hmm
[2:53:14] <+Ataraxis9> ice beam
[2:53:19] <BackflipCharm> Seems like it has good poise damage
[2:53:20] <%AncelDeLambert> wow that looks REALLY weird
[2:53:27] <ape_hawk> thats how i pee when i wake up
[2:53:28] <+aWanderingKaivo> hydro pump
[2:53:33] <%Agami23> pat learned hydro pump
[2:53:43] <Gabbycat> ape KEK
[2:53:43] <%AncelDeLambert> not sure why it fires from your right shoulder...
[2:53:44] <+aWanderingKaivo> kinda odd that it comes out at the right yeah
[2:53:46] <Profmcstevie> Hey wanna see hard I can pee? *cast*
[2:53:49] <+Havictos> downside seems to be it's useless if the target moves to the side a bit
[2:53:51] <krionik77> oh, hey heysel.
[2:53:53] <%FacetiousAF> heysel DansGame
[2:53:56] <KaiserMario> eeeewwww... not peefinger
[2:53:56] <%AncelDeLambert> and it looks REALLY bad while it charges behind you
[2:53:57] <keohtv> RIP Heysel.
[2:54:11] <+TheBitingIrish> Hm
[2:54:19] <+aWanderingKaivo> hound got him good
[2:54:26] <%AncelDeLambert> can... Pat punch with the shield?
[2:54:27] <EynoStiles> It is amazing that a modder can do a better maguc system than a game studio
[2:54:30] <holyxgrale> This mod looks so gnarly what the hell
[2:54:39] <%AncelDeLambert> I've been playing something, why shield on right?
[2:54:49] <+TheBitingIrish> Faster casts
[2:54:50] <HeroToxiko> ikr
[2:54:54] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt it's for fast casting
[2:55:05] <DeltaPangaea> To be fair, FromSoft seems allergic to making things easy and fun to use half the time at least.
[2:55:07] <KaiserMario> Shit
[2:55:11] <KaiserMario> wrong quote
[2:55:12] <FlaskOfManyThings> @AncelDeLambert The shield makes him cast faster, but he needs to also have his halberd on the right for a weapon buff.
[2:55:16] <Treasure_Vault> 1.0 elden ring is gonna be a little fucked, probably
[2:55:16] <%tank7013> @AncelDeLambert So he can get the cast speed boost and still be able to buff his weapon
[2:55:20] <keohtv> Tiny Enemy Crab!
[2:55:24] <+liquidzr0> Elden Ring and the rumored Armored Core Kreygasm
[2:55:25] <RickyRelucent> @eyno studio makes ut balanced, modder makes ut fun
[2:55:30] <NireFuster> Definitely
[2:55:33] <Sapientiae> little dude puts up a fight
[2:55:43] <%AncelDeLambert> Fromsoft listens too much to the psychos that try to no-damage run their games
[2:55:44] <DeltaPangaea> >Fromsoft >Balanced
[2:55:44] <krionik77> i forsee that game being broken as shit, because what fromsoft game isn't?
[2:55:46] <T_Sasquatch> I had alot of fun with the elden ring beta but magic really trivialized the bosses and the game in general
[2:55:47] <DeltaPangaea> HAH
[2:56:03] <%Caped_Eggy> Looking forward to find some stupid ass op builds
[2:56:04] <keohtv> that's a pretty weird hitbox
[2:56:08] <ape_hawk> is this now the piss stream?
[2:56:10] <%AncelDeLambert> @T_Sasquatch GOOD
[2:56:11] <%GhoulishCripple> I can't wait to see all the weird shit From hides under the map in elden ring.
[2:56:13] <+TheBitingIrish> @liquidzr0 Someone from Fromsoft literally confirmed they were making a new Armored Core in like 2017
[2:56:21] <KaiserMario> Oh, I think Aldrich is a good target for this spell
[2:56:26] <%oda_flobunaga> Part of the issue is that every gameplay approach has to be relatively balanced, i.e. equally boring,  this mod just turned all the Magic dials up to 111 and said Fuck it to everything else
[2:56:49] <krionik77> Yeah, the game loves it to be dark.
[2:56:52] <keohtv> where's cast from really messes with me because every cell in my brain says that the animation should be centered
[2:56:54] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  you think Elden Ring got the idea for summons from one of these conversion mods?
[2:57:05] <krionik77> on the bright side, at least torches are more useful now.
[2:57:08] <KaiserMario> for sure chatterbox
[2:57:11] <+superchronicc> @krionik77 "Dark" souls
[2:57:12] <+aWanderingKaivo> two weapons
[2:57:17] <+LordScalpington> LordScalpington subscribed with Prime. 
[2:57:19] <+TheBitingIrish> Jade
[2:57:34] <keohtv> moonlight jade sword?
[2:57:37] <EynoStiles> @rickyrelucent I would disagree. it probably cause one guy wants done his way, and not a fun way. if it was about balance the magic system would be so week in base game
[2:57:41] <KaiserMario> jade uses a staff tho
[2:57:44] <+superchronicc> The deepest, dankest forest
[2:57:49] <+aWanderingKaivo> that's just a normal old straight sword but green
[2:57:56] <RickyRelucent> thats the thing with neta, sonethings reallly good ir well figured out and tgen vibg vobg nerfhanner
[2:58:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> and it's even green too
[2:58:24] <Rhrm> whoever made this mod's favorite color is green?
[2:58:38] <DeltaPangaea> I think Pat
[2:58:45] <+aWanderingKaivo> you also picked up something called something ebony blade I think
[2:58:47] <DeltaPangaea> I think he's just playing the green magic boy
[2:59:07] <krionik77> i still think some of the coolest stuff you get is from the rekindled bosses. slight spoilers so I won't elaborate if people want to find out for themselves.
[2:59:11] <RickyRelucent> bing bing nerfhamner* if only they didnt taje advice 9/10 drom ppl bot in the i ndustry
[2:59:20] <+Ceromidas> has he mentioned whether or not he prefers this one to cinders?
[2:59:38] <KaiserMario> That's the nd of constipated coved
[2:59:53] <+Ceromidas> this is true, i have downloaded almost ten versions myself
[3:00:00] <RickyRelucent> normal ppl dont know how to hings look below the nenus
[3:00:01] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Got any guesses on what the The Elden Ring even is lorewise? My guess is maybe some kind of alliance of kingdoms or something like that.
[3:00:03] <KaiserMario> jeez, I'm struggling here with this keyboard
[3:00:03] <keohtv> cinders is the mod to play when you want to absolutely spank everything.
[3:00:06] <%doomunderthestairs> but it has no goal as you put it unlike convergence
[3:00:08] <RickyRelucent> menus*
[3:00:11] <%Agami23> oh, i didnt realize that your spells are conjurations and not sorceries. that means you can use pyromancies with your staff too
[3:00:18] <@GeneralSCPatton> I am constantly reading the Cinders changelog to decide if I want to go in for yet another run
[3:00:29] <+twohitgood> i swear cinders is like a testing ground.
[3:00:36] <%Axellogic> Pat tricked me, I skipped watchign cause of first person games hurting my eyes
[3:00:37] <%AncelDeLambert> man, that water spell is NOT good
[3:00:38] <IminyourBase> water surge seems to be a bad spell if the target aint THICC
[3:00:42] <krionik77> let's throw everything and the kitchen sink together, but also change everything around next patch: cinders in a nutshell.
[3:00:46] <AwesomeInABox> the water stream spell feels like it needs a slightly bigger hitbox
[3:00:52] <%Shonen_hero> that's a neat spell, but seems like it'd take some setup to really pay off
[3:00:57] <%doomunderthestairs> @twohitgood that's exactly it
[3:01:00] <Rhrm> regenerating magic?
[3:01:15] <%doomunderthestairs> spot on
[3:01:17] <+Havictos> more testing required?
[3:01:19] <tanarath> What if you use binocs to cast the water spell?
[3:01:19] <KaiserMario> hmmm... a bit
[3:01:21] <+mmack093> squirting
[3:01:28] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Rise PC feel so good, also is pat a catgirl in DS ?
[3:01:42] <Pie_Mastyr> it probably works better on shorter catalysts
[3:01:42] <keohtv> i remember when I was playing cinder's mod, I had something like 1200 AR at level 50 with a bow
[3:01:45] <+Ceromidas> is this just more focused on the magic side of things or is there enough going on in the other aspects of the combat?
[3:01:48] <keohtv> because I just minmaxed the hell out of it
[3:01:53] <RickyRelucent> like is it actually top/op/vroke, or r ppl being bun
[3:01:56] <+mmack093> Did that monster just say "sheeeeesh" when it died?
[3:01:57] <+Havictos> @Stormzcales_Lair Druid wearing a wolf hat
[3:01:58] <xJesterxkingx> can you free aim the beam? just curious.
[3:02:00] <RickyRelucent> buns
[3:02:00] <%greasypete00> s dis shart
[3:02:00] <boostergoldz> pretty sure hydro pump also goes through walls
[3:02:11] <KaiserMario> Kinda of a dumb issue tho, shoulda just bind the animation to center of your character
[3:02:12] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:02:31] <keohtv> Stick OP
[3:02:32] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Give him the stick!
[3:02:40] <+tempestzephyr> Stick!
[3:02:42] <DianaTheAscian> STICK
[3:02:49] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Stormzcales_Lair is it fucky at all like I remember hearing about World's initial PC release? haven't gotten Rise yet
[3:02:49] <krionik77> i'm gonna hit you with this stick and there's nothing you can do about it.
[3:02:51] <%Blank9> DON'T give him the stick
[3:02:53] <@GeneralSCPatton> Speak softly and carry a psaBig stick
[3:03:00] <RickyRelucent> s t i c k
[3:03:06] <twoah> The wood banishment catalyst
[3:03:13] <Razeino> Ooo pretty good ring
[3:03:16] <KaiserMario> Save him Jesus!
[3:03:37] <RickyRelucent> wood nair talisman
[3:03:46] <KaiserMario> Dark?
[3:04:01] <+Stormzcales_Lair> @Stormzcales_Lair I've had one crash, and minor screen tearing untill i turned on V-sync. been fine since.
[3:04:03] <@GeneralSCPatton> Cinders recently added a class that starts with a pistol, so you could do a guns-only run
[3:04:06] <HamFamJam> is the game running in a slightly faster speed?
[3:04:24] <+twohitgood> it's good for making a wall
[3:04:33] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Stormzcales_Lair nice that's not bad, good to hear
[3:04:33] <KaiserMario> ah yes, the squirter a real Crowd pleaser
[3:04:39] <krionik77> Yeah, most cryomancy stuff also has added dark affinity in this mod.
[3:04:42] <IminyourBase> are these medium hat logans? or big hats?
[3:04:50] <RickyRelucent> @gegeral, theres a halo nod with good guns mp and maps
[3:04:52] <+badhaye> I'm about to get rid of Cinder for this. This looks fucking awesome
[3:04:58] <RickyRelucent> ds1 tho
[3:04:58] <+aWanderingKaivo> big hat aspirants
[3:05:14] <+aWanderingKaivo> how the turn tables
[3:05:23] <%Agami23> yeah, might be a good idea to invest alternate damage types.
[3:05:24] <KaiserMario> Kinda Big Hats
[3:05:26] <twoah> Smedium Hat Logan
[3:05:29] <KaiserMario> Sorta
[3:05:40] <+Havictos> @aWanderingKaivo pat said it felt like it was made to be ported to more powerful systems and it really feels that way. It runs fantastic on pc better than world in my opinion.
[3:05:41] <KaiserMario> Somewhat Big Hats
[3:05:42] <twoah> Hats of unusual size
[3:05:43] <+Stormzcales_Lair> is DS3 always this fast? or is mod?
[3:05:44] <DeltaPangaea> Sizeable Hat Logans
[3:05:52] <RickyRelucent> plasma nades, snipers, all really accuratd sound and looks wise
[3:05:53] <%Shonen_hero> that essence strike dot seems really op
[3:05:56] <krionik77> the really nice thing about this mod is that because of the greater  varieties of magic, starting with new builds is way more interesting.
[3:06:06] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Havictos awesome I feel justified in waiting for the PC port now lol
[3:06:07] <%tank7013> @Stormzcales_Lair Both really
[3:06:08] <+Havictos> @Stormzcales_Lair Convergence mod for DS3
[3:06:28] <+badhaye> Any cool katana stuff show up yet?
[3:06:36] <%pectusumbra> Where are we going?!
[3:06:39] <%whyskeywolfe> He's not that tricky.
[3:06:46] <IminyourBase> wizard fight is you hide behind a tree
[3:06:47] <RickyRelucent> : c
[3:06:55] <+Stormzcales_Lair> yeah just wondering if base game was this speed for when i get there thanks.
[3:06:57] <%pectusumbra> kill him for his Bafmodads
[3:07:06] <+aWanderingKaivo> well he is a druid, trees are his friends
[3:07:06] <KaiserMario> Of I thought it was Navlaan
[3:07:10] <RickyRelucent> BOP TearGlove
[3:07:13] <%FunkyStreams> Run DMC, anyone?
[3:07:19] <EynoStiles> this is some harry potter shit  lol
[3:07:43] <+TheBitingIrish> Holy fuck
[3:07:43] <KaiserMario> massive
[3:07:51] <KaiserMario> Fight Wizards
[3:07:52] <krionik77> put that on for the sage.
[3:07:56] <tolloponik> number go UP
[3:08:04] <boostergoldz> they made the stoneplates worth something like the status rings
[3:08:04] <KaiserMario> Wizard Slayer Ring
[3:08:06] <+badhaye> Is setting up this mod easy?
[3:08:08] <cosmicgoatee> 10 points to Ravenclaw
[3:08:10] <Pie_Mastyr> GMB on a ring lol
[3:08:11] <Rhrm> You're a druid, Harry.
[3:08:19] <Pie_Mastyr> havel would be proud
[3:08:24] <%tank7013> @badhaye Very
[3:08:26] <krionik77> yeah, they made a lot of the ring status buffs huge in this game.
[3:08:26] <%Glass_Muffin> @PatStaresAt This fart magic you're using looks dank as shit
[3:08:28] <%pectusumbra> practically a Havel "fuck magic" the rock ring
[3:08:55] <@GeneralSCPatton> Good dommage?
[3:08:58] <+badhaye> @tank7013 nice. I'll have to try it out this weekend
[3:09:05] <%TheDullaMAN> Let's have a thinky think
[3:09:09] <+TheBitingIrish> Nah doodDerp
[3:09:12] <KaiserMario> You need a special smithy for that sword, a Jaden Smith
[3:09:14] <+Havictos> @badhaye You literally just download and find your install directory and bam there you go
[3:09:17] <boostergoldz> you can use dark damage easy with your build as it is
[3:09:24] <%Agami23> but fire exists
[3:09:36] <twoah> With def rings getting that big of a buff, horsehoof better punt enemies into the stratosphere
[3:09:38] <%Agami23> you can also use physical spells like geomancy
[3:09:50] <krionik77> what about the corvian great blade or whatever it is.
[3:09:51] <+twohitgood> would the threaded falchion be good?
[3:09:54] <+evilmagetim> that rapier had dark
[3:09:59] <+aWanderingKaivo> down and on the right in your list?
[3:10:01] <+TheBitingIrish> Use jade sword and buff with the spelll and do like 500 magic damage
[3:10:09] <%Agami23> @twoah they already buffed the kick
[3:10:11] <@GeneralSCPatton> @kaisermario booooo psaGoblin
[3:10:13] <%tank7013> Ice is dark in Convergence
[3:10:23] <Saturation_Lizard> ice magic does dark damage
[3:10:26] <boostergoldz> things with frost on them are dark damage
[3:10:28] <KaiserMario> Thank you Patton!
[3:10:33] <KaiserMario> I'm here all night
[3:10:35] <moogleboy1984> NO Escape
[3:10:40] <boostergoldz> because cryomancies are dark damage
[3:10:40] <BliVru> @patstaresat you can use all conjuration type magic with that staff. like druid magic and the Ice dark magic
[3:10:41] <twoah> @agami23 Noice
[3:10:46] <%Agami23> probably need murky sediment
[3:10:59] <%Puhff> !uptime
[3:10:59] <@Moobot> @Puhff I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 11m.
[3:11:00] <Enn19> Did the mod change the lighting?Feels a lot nicer here
[3:11:15] <%TheDullaMAN> That staff can cast all kinds of magic
[3:11:21] <+aWanderingKaivo> threaded falchion lets go
[3:11:21] <%Agami23> conjuration is druid stuff, pyromancies, geomancies, and cryokmancies
[3:11:26] <boostergoldz> when in doubt longsword
[3:11:29] <BliVru> The ice magic sells dark-ice magic. you can use both
[3:11:39] <BliVru> i meant ice guy
[3:11:40] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Hello Pat and chat, did you guys hear about that cheese factory in France that blew up? There was nothing left but de brie
[3:11:46] <%tank7013> @Enn19 Yea, it seems to do that. Like Pat went to archdragon peak briefly last stream and it was raining there
[3:11:53] <+Havictos> @Enn19 it does but sometimes the game chugs because it can't handle the new light sources perfectly in some places
[3:11:59] <krionik77> when you look at the spells, it'll tell you what type it is, conjuration, sorcery, e.t.c. your spell casting items will tell you what they can cast. most can do some combo of more than one type.
[3:12:08] <Enn19> Huh. Cool! Thanks chat
[3:12:11] <%TheDullaMAN> How get twinkling titanite?
[3:12:19] <%Agami23> your staff is good for druid stuff and pyromancies. and kinda bad for cryomancies and geomancies
[3:12:27] <+Ceromidas> did this mod change the lighting too or is that reshade
[3:12:29] <%FacetiousAF> @TheDullaMAN shop??
[3:12:42] <+Havictos> @Ceromidas it does
[3:12:44] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Ceromidas some areas have had altered lighting yeah
[3:12:44] <krionik77> mod changes lighting on its own.
[3:12:52] <+Ceromidas> neato
[3:12:56] <%Agami23> yeah
[3:13:06] <%Agami23> check its description
[3:13:13] <EynoStiles> @chrisplaysthing Its was a gouda thing no one was working
[3:13:22] <+TheBitingIrish> Says in description
[3:13:23] <krionik77> yeah, pyromancy flames will outright tell you what affinities are good for them for example.
[3:13:31] <AnacondaVirtue> It's based on the catalyst's "affinity"
[3:13:33] <+Stormzcales_Lair> is there electromancy?
[3:13:34] <%Agami23> those are all the types of conjurations, but it says what elements its good at
[3:13:44] <krionik77> it's important to read item descriptions for spellcasting stuff in this.
[3:13:54] <%Agami23> @Stormzcales_Lair miracles and light sorceries
[3:13:57] <Profmcstevie> very clear
[3:14:02] <boostergoldz> that dark rapier is a really good crit weapon
[3:14:05] <%pectusumbra> that's an interesting way to do things in this
[3:14:06] <%washicka> accurate descriptions?! In my souls game?!
[3:14:21] <+Stormzcales_Lair> oh so still that dang thanks
[3:14:31] <+Havictos> what does that mean?
[3:14:35] <+NobuuNobuu> there are physical magic or it's just strikes and such?
[3:14:49] <boostergoldz> yeah 140 critical modifier
[3:14:49] <%Agami23> physical magic
[3:15:01] <+aWanderingKaivo> maybe geomancy is physical?
[3:15:05] <%Agami23> physical magic is aeromancy and geomancy.
[3:15:19] <%Shonen_hero> I hear big lady
[3:15:22] <boostergoldz> geomancy and aeromancy are phys yeah
[3:15:24] <%Agami23> geomancy being a cojuration and aeromancy being a sorcery
[3:15:30] <RickyRelucent> gyromancy
[3:15:45] <%pectusumbra> @aWanderingKaivo I mean dark stuff in DS1 was phys or part phys as well so it's not new to the mod
[3:15:46] <DeltaPangaea> It's pronounced yeeromancy.
[3:15:51] <+Havictos> who cares about fair
[3:16:07] <%Agami23> i think your staff can only do cojurations
[3:16:27] <HoboFlea> Pat, you just took a soul spear to the face and your lifebar barely moved. Now THIS is pod racing.
[3:16:35] <%Agami23> normal magic is sorceries
[3:16:35] <krionik77> yeah, in general things are split between conjurations, miracles, and sorceries in this game.
[3:16:36] <%pectusumbra> makes sense. the lore in this is that druids are offshoots of sorcerery
[3:16:38] <%AoiRob> @PatStaresAt no. druidism is in the conjuration category
[3:16:38] <%FunkyStreams> @Ceromidas the mod changed the lightning
[3:16:43] <%epide> GET IT PAT
[3:16:49] <RickyRelucent> "is the big woman here?"
[3:16:58] <DaCheekyOne> Stab it in the dick
[3:16:58] <+twohitgood> there's so much health
[3:17:11] <+Havictos> Is the music different in this mod? It's been a LONG time since I played.
[3:17:13] <%pectusumbra> man this makes me want to look up and see if zullie did any vids on this boss
[3:17:19] <%FunkyStreams> lol
[3:17:20] <%HotSauceFiend> I NEVER REALIZED UNTIL NOW THAT THIS IS BIG HAT LOGAN ISNT IT
[3:17:23] <%HotSauceFiend> whoops caps
[3:17:25] <KaiserMario> Splish Splash
[3:17:29] <boostergoldz> no
[3:17:34] <%AoiRob> i just realized this boss is a re-do of Pinwheel
[3:17:35] <+twohitgood> @HotSauceFiend it's a disciple of logan.
[3:17:42] <+aWanderingKaivo> its a cosplayer
[3:17:42] <HoboFlea> @HotSauceFiend disciple, per her soul
[3:17:43] <+tempestzephyr> Does he not have clones?
[3:17:46] <DeltaPangaea> It's a logan reference, not logan himself.
[3:17:47] <%FunkyStreams> hydro thunder
[3:17:47] <%TheDullaMAN> Big Hat Fanboy
[3:17:51] <KaiserMario> Big Hat Stan
[3:17:52] <moogleboy1984> Blastoise used Hydro Pump
[3:17:53] <%notsoy> nice aim lmao
[3:17:55] <@GeneralSCPatton> Big Hat Cosplayer
[3:17:59] <+NobuuNobuu> fan cosplay of bighat
[3:18:02] <Zlinnt> bighat fanboi LUL
[3:18:06] <+Havictos> @HotSauceFiend It's some magic guy that thought Big Hat had good fashion sense
[3:18:08] <%MidnightBurst12> Mid Hat Stan
[3:18:16] <WillSin4Cash> Big Hat Brogan
[3:18:19] <krionik77> here come the clones.
[3:18:28] <Profmcstevie> Just a fan? Oh it's Big Fat Phony >:(
[3:18:29] <%oda_flobunaga> Big Brim Billy
[3:18:29] <RickyRelucent> big shat chokin'
[3:18:32] <DeltaPangaea> The souls games are MASSIVELY hamstrung in how fun they can be by the invasion system.
[3:18:41] <+aWanderingKaivo> Mid Hat Rogan
[3:18:41] <%bevyrage> mmm delicious water surge bevyraSip
[3:18:44] <DeltaPangaea> Because things have to ostensible be balanced for pvp
[3:18:49] <%Agami23> i dunno. the water surge doesent seem that great
[3:18:54] <%FunkyStreams> croiky
[3:19:00] <+Crimsbacon> Large Ca Larry
[3:19:05] <DeltaPangaea> Also watchin' while doing Praetorium, hah
[3:19:13] <RickyRelucent> @awanderingkaivo  VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea LUL
[3:19:14] <+tempestzephyr> damn wombo'd
[3:19:18] <DeltaPangaea> Other tank's an afking lazy ass.
[3:19:22] <AwesomeInABox> that water surge spell seems to really have bad hit reg from the left hand
[3:19:26] <krionik77> the problem is that the sage doesn't stay stunned from the water spell, probly better to use dot.
[3:19:43] <boostergoldz> you can get real tanky and stack passive regen
[3:19:51] <+Havictos> @DeltaPangaea Like not pressing buttons?
[3:20:02] <%StephanieSadGirl> I THINK the dot spell was doing more damage overall then anything, could be wrong
[3:20:08] <%pectusumbra> regrowth with lingering dragon crest would be nasty
[3:20:17] <RickyRelucent> do it battlegief
[3:20:17] <DeltaPangaea> Yeah they're flat out afk'd
[3:20:18] <%Agami23> fun fact. most forms of bleed are nerfed in this mod
[3:20:21] <DeltaPangaea> A ways back
[3:20:22] <+UltraViolet371> huh, phase 2 music is borked
[3:20:23] <+twohitgood> fun fact: so long as sage has hsm up, he can't teleport away.
[3:20:43] <%KnifeyMcEdge> KnifeyMcEdge converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[3:20:51] <+twohitgood> you can parry that melee
[3:20:53] <%FunkyStreams> pimp hand be strong
[3:20:53] <MsYakumo> Crystal sage out here pondering the orb.
[3:20:58] <+aWanderingKaivo> he really spammed it there
[3:20:59] <KaiserMario> You kill him too fast usually
[3:21:02] <krionik77> first try.
[3:21:07] <boostergoldz> you can parry the melee
[3:21:08] <krionik77> noice.
[3:21:09] <Saturation_Lizard> he has farron flashsword and the rapier you get from his boss soul
[3:21:11] <SeeAndShudder> yeah he brings that out a lot
[3:21:17] <krionik77> further up.
[3:21:28] <%KnifeyMcEdge> So that's Big Hat Logan, right?
[3:21:35] <+NobuuNobuu> speed runners usually bait that to parry it
[3:21:43] <boostergoldz> no
[3:22:21] <KaiserMario> This Druid shit is really stronk
[3:22:54] <krionik77> it's fun having damage over time abilities that are actually effective.
[3:22:54] <%FunkyStreams> he thursty
[3:22:56] <+Gamefriendly> does the DOT stack with itself?
[3:23:01] <SeeAndShudder> thank god you cant do pvp with this mod, thats the trollest spell ive ever seen
[3:23:07] <+Havictos> @KnifeyMcEdge no it's just some guy that though Big Hat was cool so he got his own big hat
[3:23:24] <+Gamefriendly> thats pretty good
[3:23:27] <Twistedoldham> Darl Souls 3 lol
[3:23:33] <KaiserMario> Huh
[3:23:35] <%KnifeyMcEdge> @Havictos a big hat fanboy, got it.
[3:23:46] <KaiserMario> Get drops
[3:23:50] <boostergoldz> you get other stuff for his boss soul
[3:23:52] <+wizard_of_diamonds> It's a Convergence thing. I just made it in unmodded DS3
[3:23:54] <%doomunderthestairs> no escape
[3:24:00] <+Havictos> @KnifeyMcEdge pretty much
[3:24:06] <%FunkyStreams> huh
[3:24:08] <krionik77> keep the crystal sage rapier, it boosts magic damage.
[3:24:18] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Spirit doggy lusts for blood
[3:24:19] <BliVru> @patstaresat the Irithyl straight might be a better weapon
[3:24:29] <KaiserMario> Oh hey
[3:24:30] <%tank7013> Oh god these things WutFace
[3:24:30] <Sapientiae> maybe because that's not a summonable area
[3:24:31] <Vi_Stri> WTF IS THAT
[3:24:31] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> WutFace
[3:24:32] <+WaywardSera> boogs
[3:24:33] <KaiserMario> Dlc boys
[3:24:35] <Treasure_Vault> There's a cool area over here with nothing in the base game, I wonder if they added something here
[3:24:38] <+wizard_of_diamonds> They took out that hard assassin for those?
[3:24:46] <BliVru> ah shit
[3:24:46] <+UltraViolet371> the lighting also decided it was time for a big change

[3:33:40] <%notsoy> holy shit that boi is BIG

[3:34:20] <TheeRabbi> balanced
[3:34:20] <+aWanderingKaivo> big summon staggers into hydro pump seems pretty good

[3:34:42] <BliVru> Swamp
[3:34:42] <%maskofmichael> at the stone gem store

[3:35:00] <jkips56> The handmaiden has the gems
[3:35:00] <krionik77> downstairs actually, next to pyromancy man.
[3:35:05] <CrimsonGargoyle> stone is below next to pyro
[3:35:09] <KaiserMario> You have to get a pickaxe and mine it from a demon's ass
[3:35:14] <krionik77> Give them the scrolls, they have cool shit.
[3:35:18] <CrimsonGargoyle> ^
[3:35:20] <%CappuccinoGuil> You can get it from Boffa The Impaled
[3:35:23] <%StephanieSadGirl> shes fart trainer
[3:35:56] <boostergoldz> cloud form is sick

[3:36:04] <CrimsonGargoyle> GOTTEM
[3:36:07] <+SodiumPatrol> is darl souls the name of the ds3 mod? or convergence?
[3:36:08] <%PlatinumAvacyn> I think the stray demon has stone stuff near it?

[3:36:44] <DaCheekyOne> "Geomancer Morax" is this a Genshin Impact reference Kappa ?
[3:36:45] <%PlatinumAvacyn> oh yeah the shrine maiden sells them after some ashes
[3:36:53] <Gabbycat> yes
[3:36:59] <boostergoldz> raw
[3:37:05] <CrimsonGargoyle> ayyy you're using the sekirojustu sword! sick!
[3:37:22] <+tempestzephyr> luck
[3:37:27] <boostergoldz> oh raw was worse
[3:37:46] <%dekkitout> It's fookin RAW
[3:37:46] <%PlatinumAvacyn> lmao yeah lost 20 damage
[3:37:55] <+UltraViolet371> if only ffxiv had job trainers like the acclaimed Stone Demon, or the famous Lizard Man
[3:38:03] <Gabbycat> ROTTEN
[3:38:06] <DeltaPangaea> Such Devastation...
[3:38:12] <CrimsonGargoyle> scaling is so weird you'll sometimes find damage in unexpected stones
[3:38:17] <%KnifeyMcEdge> 21
[3:38:19] <%BinaryFireball> because raw sucks
[3:38:19] <boostergoldz> oh now it's better?
[3:38:24] <%PlatinumAvacyn> oh I'm blind I saw 250
[3:38:28] <+twohitgood> raw is best if you're not upgrading stats
[3:38:41] <+twohitgood> it isn't good at +1 but it moves ahead after +2 or 3.
[3:38:45] <Saturation_Lizard> the bottom left infusion is probably good for you
[3:38:50] <%dekkitout> Is this a monster hunter numbers lie thing again
[3:38:51] <boostergoldz> when it was +0 no infusion was slightly better
[3:39:07] <%Agami23> greyrat sells titanite
[3:39:20] <krionik77> there is a covenant that allows regular titanite to drop from enemies.
[3:39:23] <%BinaryFireball> wait so is he not leveling stats???
[3:39:24] <KaiserMario> Look at this old lady rubbing ash on her tits like she's big boss or whatever
[3:39:28] <+MidnightBasker> "Ashen, wuh, haHaha..."
[3:39:30] <CrimsonGargoyle> cuz greyrat is metal af
[3:39:30] <%PlatinumAvacyn> @patstaresat I think dreamchaser ashes let's her sell gems
[3:39:48] <boostergoldz> greyrat sells enhanced titanite for higher tier infusions
[3:39:55] <%Birdigalore> Huge balls
[3:40:04] <krionik77> counterpoint, this seems like a terrible idea.
[3:40:07] <Gabbycat> @MidnightBasker leave her alone she's old :(
[3:40:25] <jkips56> Yea I forgot that you have to give her ashes to get her to sell the gems
[3:40:26] <%dekkitout> I cast Kaiju
[3:40:31] <youngin_______420> i never killed dancer lepSAD
[3:40:39] <%Shonen_hero> this is so busted
[3:40:46] <TallYoda08> LUL
[3:40:49] <KaiserMario> A hint of a chance actually
[3:40:50] <+Havictos> You don't but e;der Grue does
[3:40:50] <%Agami23> your essense strikes probably would do better
[3:40:53] <zhenthrim213> NO CHANCE
[3:40:54] <+Havictos> elder
[3:40:59] <krionik77> i mean, you took out a quarter of her healthbar already. and that was without dot.
[3:41:00] <Gabbycat> ehh maybe
[3:41:02] <+UltraViolet371> imagine Dancer with the Blue Smelter treatment, with randomly varying attack speeds
[3:41:05] <@Lion_kun> you were doing fine
[3:41:07] <kikoeru_san> that kinda looked like you had a chance bro
[3:41:08] <projecthazoid> was that two bosses infighting?
[3:41:13] <KaiserMario> I give you 2-8 odds
[3:41:13] <%RetroCop87> she could deflect your emerald splash
[3:41:35] <%Shonen_hero> man I do not like those at all
[3:41:43] <+Havictos> what?
[3:41:51] <BlockingDisabled> hazvsOHDAM

[3:44:27] <Treasure_Vault> Can you check the area left of the stairs, by the bonfire? It's probably nothing but who knows
[3:44:45] <krionik77> he did already.
[3:44:57] <Treasure_Vault> The little up a hill area?
[3:45:18] <Treasure_Vault> It's nothing in the base game but a nice view
[3:45:19] <+Gruber0> why's it green? Is he shooting farts?
[3:45:25] <Saturation_Lizard> man i hope some of the ashes of war in elden ring are just straight up sekiro moves, the blood slash in the gameplay reveal kinda reminds me of mortal draw

[3:47:05] <DeltaPangaea> That's the kind of dumb enemy that is extra aggravating.
[3:47:06] <+tempestzephyr> wow, I guess fire is super effective against water after all
[3:47:12] <%FacetiousAF> these fuckin flies
[3:47:14] <DeltaPangaea> Because it's just some dumbass flailing at you.
[3:47:15] <Treasure_Vault> By the bonfire
[3:47:17] <%SirGO0SE> Pat hoping no one saw that LUL

[3:47:28] <Jontman42> ...
[3:47:31] <%Shonen_hero> makes my skin prickle
[3:47:48] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> It's okay Pat. You won't die anymore. You'll crush it like 9 times.
[3:47:59] <KaiserMario> wow
[3:48:09] <krionik77> yes.
[3:48:15] <KaiserMario> How did you died to that even?
[3:48:18] <+Cybercobra2> @DeltaPangaea i mean he died becouse they turned themselves into a living bomb. and the flailing enemies are very easy to dodge so its not like its effective.
[3:48:28] <%G_Thunders> Yooo
[3:48:28] <LordOfThePoultry> its him monkaS
[3:48:30] <+UltraViolet371> a sufficiently evil mod creator could make those guys explode on death no matter what. ...good thing I'm not a mod creator

[3:48:51] <KaiserMario> EVILLAAAAAKKK
[3:48:51] <%BinaryFireball> nothing scary here
[3:48:53] <DeltaPangaea> It's still extra annoying, like the sword hollows in 1 when they spaz out and do a million damage.
[3:48:59] <%KnifeyMcEdge> SURVIVE HIM, PAT

[3:49:32] <%Deft_Thought> Oh no
[3:49:37] <+Cybercobra2> thats a tough boi
[3:49:41] <DeltaPangaea> snoozy
[3:49:52] <%Deft_Thought> This one thick
[3:50:18] <KaiserMario> booyakasha
[3:50:26] <+Havictos> kill the thing in the church
[3:50:36] <%SirGO0SE> there were some jo bros in that corner
[3:50:41] <%SirGO0SE> just chargin' ykno
[3:50:46] <%FacetiousAF> pog?
[3:50:50] <+TheBitingIrish> But why
[3:50:51] <%BinaryFireball> did they mod the dlc too?
[3:50:52] <+mmack093> Face down ass up
[3:50:57] <%FunkyStreams> unexpected
[3:51:14] <SubjectX07x> @BinaryFireball Yes the DLC is modded.
[3:51:16] <Gabbycat> oh that was different
[3:51:22] <+Havictos> that dude isn't looking so hot
[3:51:26] <%BinaryFireball> cooool
[3:51:39] <+mmack093> Isn't it really really early to be doing the DLC?
[3:51:50] <+Havictos> some of them are fake
[3:52:05] <SubjectX07x> The only real change in this DLC is some enemy placements are moved around I believe and the gravetender boss is different.
[3:52:07] <krionik77> that's the cryomancy covenant you just picked up. DLC is mostly unchanged in terms of looks. mostly added weather effects and remixed enemies on occiasion.
[3:52:11] <%dekkitout> Are the tree babies cool with droods
[3:52:33] <krionik77> base game is where most of the big changes in this mod are.
[3:52:41] <%BinaryFireball> until the wolves that is
[3:53:03] <%PlatinumAvacyn> gravetender boss is way cool now
[3:53:04] <boostergoldz> this and cinders don't touch the dlc much and i'm guessing there's a reason for that
[3:53:13] <+Cybercobra2> no that seems the same
[3:53:14] <krionik77> good place to grind at least.
[3:53:14] <Gabbycat> it's the same
[3:53:28] <SubjectX07x> @PlatinumAvacyn Really, I mean.. I didn't really care for it much but that's just me.
[3:53:53] <Saturation_Lizard> @boostergoldz the reason is not everyone has the DLC, both mods are also designed to be compatible without the DLC
[3:54:02] <%greasypete00> they do like a quarter of your health
[3:54:11] <%PlatinumAvacyn> @subjectx07x it's neat. better than wolf imo
[3:54:15] <boostergoldz> makes sense
[3:54:19] <SubjectX07x> @Saturation_Lizard I uhh, pretty sure Convergence requires the DLC.
[3:54:19] <krionik77> actually this mod requires the dlc.
[3:54:20] <BedHome> i heard convergance requires the dlc tor un at all tho
[3:54:35] <+UltraViolet371> basically just seems tuned with the expectation of having OP spells later on
[3:54:50] <SubjectX07x> @PlatinumAvacyn ??? The Wolf is still part of the fight, they just changed it from rando NPC named gravetender to a crowboi.
[3:54:51] <Quack_of_Dawn> The new darkmoon sorceries are pretty sick.  I beat the game minus DLC recently.
[3:54:53] <Treasure_Vault> From that previous bonfire, go left before going up the stairs. There's a path up a hill. Took me several playthroughs to find it. Nothing there in the base game.
[3:55:07] <Treasure_Vault> Cathedral of the Deep bonfire*
[3:55:08] <%FunkyStreams> @BedHome it uses some the the DLC assets in the base game, so yeah.
[3:55:12] <%PlatinumAvacyn> @patstaresat the boss at the bottom ie different in that dlc but mostly same iirc
[3:55:20] <%BinaryFireball> a persistant one lol
[3:55:39] <KaiserMario> They were right
[3:55:49] <Treasure_Vault> Hahaha, worth
[3:55:51] <%SirGO0SE> im gonna bloom Kreygasm
[3:56:11] <Treasure_Vault> This place is cool in the base game, but nothing but a nice view.
[3:56:18] <%PlatinumAvacyn> hp regen pog
[3:56:24] <boostergoldz> talisman with regen WA
[3:56:26] <%Agami23> its good for geomancy and druid stuff
[3:56:27] <krionik77> nice job @Treasure_Vault .
[3:56:39] <%ClericOfSparda> HP Regen tho
[3:56:47] <Reborn2killu> hp regen though
[3:56:48] <boostergoldz> it might have more spellbuff
[3:56:55] <%Agami23> if you wanted to go with geomancy ontop of druidism, then you would go with the bloom
[3:56:57] <%PlatinumAvacyn> it starts at almost the same spell buff as you +7 staff
[3:57:02] <krionik77> there's always the good ol storage box.
[3:57:12] <KaiserMario> fap regen
[3:57:24] <Quack_of_Dawn> Spell buff only goes up by 1 or 2 each upgrade level
[3:57:39] <%SirGO0SE> so is it just better?
[3:57:42] <+aWanderingKaivo> I forget does the listed spell buff take into account the scaling
[3:57:59] <Quack_of_Dawn> I think even at +10 it only went up maybe 3 in my run
[3:58:01] <%SirGO0SE> i saw some other stuff thats normally not there like fire / magic weak/strong
[3:58:04] <+aWanderingKaivo> or wait, I don't think it does iirc
[3:58:07] <%SirGO0SE> what was that about
[3:58:08] <Quack_of_Dawn> from 9 to 10
[3:58:25] <Quack_of_Dawn> @SirGO0SE Different spellcasting things do different spells better
[3:58:33] <tux_3do> jesus fucking christ ive never seen this mod, those flies scared the shit out of me
[3:58:33] <krionik77> yeah, even with stuff that
[3:58:41] <%SirGO0SE> damage and speed? @Quack_of_Dawn cool
[3:58:44] <boostergoldz> spell catalysts can cast multiple types of spells
[3:58:53] <krionik77> is primarily meant for certain spells, affinities change a bunch.
[3:59:01] <Quack_of_Dawn> Like some sorcery catalysts are better with magic damage, others with lightning or physical
[3:59:08] <Treasure_Vault> Is that a bonfire in front of this building or am I tripping?
[3:59:12] <Gelphaze> Dead!
[3:59:14] <%FacetiousAF> night
