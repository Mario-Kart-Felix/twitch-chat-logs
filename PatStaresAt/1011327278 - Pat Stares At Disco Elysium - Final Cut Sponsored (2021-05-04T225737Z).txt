[0:35:59] <%hiswill98> Reminds me of Hollow Knights‚Äôs final pantheon
[0:36:03] <%Pookiedaexzile> What if we made the Boss Run of Dark Souls longer and mandatory
[0:36:05] <Tisaric> it seems like they really don't understand why roguelikes are like hour long at the very high end
[0:36:25] <%Kataguro> Curved.  Swords.
[0:36:27] <%holydeviant1> I want the chemist.
[0:36:28] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt so is returnal worth getting a ps5 for?

[0:36:35] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Those redguards

[0:36:37] <+bluedude153> no!!!
[0:36:38] <%holydeviant1> Just throw bottles at people
[0:36:38] <%Blackleafx> @iamgrapes the way minh phrased it made it seem like everyone there was ok with being seen on stream
[0:36:41] <%crimsonharvest> thats annoying marauder is already a pirate
[0:36:42] <%TaifuDragon> it's definitely a scythe
[0:36:43] <TioXyco> Scythe in one hand, hammer in the other Kappa
[0:36:48] <%Blackleafx> corsair or reaver
[0:36:49] <Profmcstevie> No console is worth a single game
[0:36:53] <%Monkeyweed21> its a scythe and either Mystic Knight or Reaper\
[0:37:01] <%Kataguro> I hope he hangs out with Adachi
[0:37:02] <%Garthunox> Isnt Zenos switching to the new job?
[0:37:03] <susukouhai> what if Skypirate
[0:37:09] <%Silvance> You're at 666 viewers
[0:37:10] <DianaTheAscian> @Profmcstevie I would say bloodborne was
[0:37:10] <%WhereIsWill> @Profmcstevie tell bloodborne that LUL
[0:37:12] <Thepothero> Pirates rp soon
[0:37:23] <%Garthunox> and didnt Fandango say its an "antiquated weapon?"
[0:37:26] <%Blackleafx> its 100% a scythe
[0:37:26] <%Dakuu75> I think Demon Souls is the only thing "worth getting a PS5" for. That and the slim chance Bloodborne gets a reemaster
[0:37:29] <%SveriSageAdvice> @Garthunox that's what it is being speculated, we have no confirmation yet
[0:37:38] <%Kataguro> Fuck does Cuno care
[0:37:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I hope they dont fuck it up
[0:37:40] <%BeeComfy> I think Mass Effect will actuallybe good
[0:37:42] <%Monkeyweed21> Corsair would be saved for the expansion where we head to the New World
[0:38:05] <IamGrapes> I'm putting a dollar with my FC mates that its being Corsair but the new class is probably leaning towards a scyth weilding class
[0:38:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> But Jason Momoa hot tho
[0:38:12] <Daxalog> What happened to atlantis? Corp meddling?
[0:38:16] <%Mathochism> Atlantis is better than SG1 or Universe, tho.
[0:38:17] <slix3431> Hey Pat
[0:38:21] <%WhereIsWill> i hope corsair gives buffs like it did in 11

[1:15:29] <%bravebravesrobin> no one has the right politics
[1:15:33] <Daxalog> Is Catan any good?
[1:15:41] <%JoshManVGH> @sadboy_otoroshi Alot of board game component dont have time to fully dry in the factory line, so there tends to be a scent of ink when you first open a new game.
[1:15:42] <%TheMattman1313> This sounds like the game Puerto Rico
[1:15:42] <%jorniev> just do contracts

[1:16:39] <SomeAsianDood> @JobbedBone I think it was done as an attempt to avoid directly portraying drugs to keep the age rating down. Still got banned in AU though
[1:16:40] <%Piemen99> Did pat ever get his gun back?
[1:16:42] <%JoshManVGH> It's also part of why there is some warping in brand new board game components because the ink finishes drying.

[1:54:35] <%jorniev> he is wrong
[1:54:36] <%hax_metatron> I love the dichotomy: Nice Joyce working for EVIL, slimy Evrart working for good
[1:54:40] <+emperri> It seems like a lot of the symptoms of Pale exposure overlap with giving plausible deniability to people's toxic behaviors
[1:54:43] <%Treuan> aww
[1:54:47] <%Ranryu692> that still shows up if you do narcotics, fyi
[1:55:01] <%Blackleafx> @emperri i mean its literally tied to human consciousness
[1:55:03] <%Monkeyweed21> @Zap_Rowsdower32 he's looking at the impending bloodbath that will kill the Hardie Boys and is licking his lips
[1:55:04] <%Dakuu75> So, is this guy good or evil?
[1:55:16] <owleyet> @dakuu75 yes
[1:55:18] <%Blackleafx> @Dakuu75 He's socialist and he's pragmatic
[1:55:19] <+projectmanatees> @dakuu75 yes
[1:55:21] <%Mendin> Yes
[1:55:25] <%jorniev> @Dakuu75 also evil
[1:55:25] <+wizard_of_diamonds> bruh
[1:55:28] <%luftraumm1> absolutely
[1:55:28] <televisedrevolting> @dakuu75 He's a true blue communist.
[1:55:29] <%toastybites> @Dakuu75 he's a guy willing to do things for his ideals

[1:55:47] <cardamomo88> TRUE
[1:55:47] <%Kataguro> Krenel kind of doesn't fit into his plan
[1:55:48] <%Blackleafx> To be honest he wasn't counting on you being a HUGE communist
[1:55:49] <+JobbedBone> wtf 3 LUL
[1:55:49] <BerryliciousDefinition> Based Everart
[1:55:51] <%hax_metatron> HE SAVED LIVES
[1:55:54] <+emperri> @Blackleafx Yeah, I just mean like narratively it seems like almost everyone in the game is either "shitbag or maybe it's all due to pale"
[1:55:54] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Thing is violence is the only solution to stop the Moralintern from colonizing Revachol
[1:55:54] <Tisaric> Evrart is slimy as shit but he knows his shit becasue of it
[1:55:55] <%jorniev> oh wow
[1:55:56] <sirtommygunn> yeah but if you knew you'd have fucked it up
[1:55:56] <+Astrobstrd> He's corrupt but he looks out for the people in his town. And he's also totally right about the wine mom liberal so
[1:55:59] <remainprofane> 1
[1:56:02] <+ThomasOfTroy> As much as I fucking hate him, the plan worked out perfectly
[1:56:04] <%Dakuu75> @Broken_Sonex I like that answer the best
[1:56:05] <owleyet> i hate him bc hes obnoxious but he's very good at what he does
[1:56:07] <sadboy_otoroshi> @Dakuu75 It is called oportunistic pragmatism.
[1:56:23] <+Hick12> Elmo spotted. :)
[1:56:23] <%Broken_Sonex> @Dakuu75 It's the right one
[1:56:25] <aiutare47> I dont like him saying that
[1:56:25] <+Astrobstrd> Oh I DON'T like hearing him say pussy

[1:56:30] <CappuccinoGuil> What about dick, Evrart?
[1:56:30] <%Urgotfantasy> Stop saying that evrart
[1:56:31] <primaryfire> it sounds so weird coming from his mouth
[1:56:33] <Hellarussian> poosay
[1:56:36] <aiutare47> it makes me oddly uncomfortable
[1:56:36] <%Maids4lyfe> he's such a well written character, and the actor fucking nails it
[1:56:37] <sirtommygunn> stop saying pussy
[1:56:37] <+senfood> OH MY GOD, HE'S HENRY KISSINGER
[1:56:38] <%bassoontyphoon> But is it better than Bussy?
[1:56:39] <+skyheys> okay but what about infopussy
[1:56:40] <%xcompleasedad> I don't agree? I think Evart is using Communism to enrich himself. He's more than willing to get his workers killed so he can get more power.
[1:56:43] <%SirGO0SE> i hate it
[1:56:43] <%Blackleafx> @emperri Yeah i get what you mean about how its tied to toxic behavior. personally i dont buy the fixation some parts of the fandom have on the pale being behind harry's memory lapse, but i like that its at least plausible
[1:56:45] <+emperri> pussie~
[1:56:47] <+wizard_of_diamonds> What a slimey fuck
[1:56:54] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> At least he recognizes our disconess
[1:56:54] <%Maids4lyfe> @senfood oh my god you're right
[1:56:54] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I can SEE him try to manipulate you
[1:57:03] <+projectmanatees> I don‚Äôt trust him but his plan worked
[1:57:04] <DSD24> I like 3
[1:57:07] <%hax_metatron> @xcompleasedad No way, he saved the harbor
[1:57:16] <%Blackleafx> yo evrart fucks
[1:57:19] <+Soliloquy123> btw Pat please stop being political it upsets me Kappa
[1:57:20] <%Kataguro> I'm not sure why you're buying into the shit he's saying.  He's clearly fucking with you even now
[1:57:21] <DSD24> This is my weapon
[1:57:21] <+JobbedBone> there can be only one boiadero
[1:57:23] <SomeAsianDood> PULL OUT YOUR GUN
[1:57:25] <%walternatorz> Mr. Evrart is helping me find my gun.
[1:57:26] <%GarbageNirvana> he's doing the right thing for the wrong reasons
[1:57:28] <+JobbedBone> they would kill eachother
[1:57:29] <ingman112> You can ask him about the youth center as well now for some neat context, under 3
[1:57:32] <%jorniev> @hax_metatron he stole it for himself and his brother
[1:57:36] <%xcompleasedad> @hax_metatron By getting the company to send in a death squad???
[1:57:38] <DSD24> Oh god
[1:57:39] <dbag202> Evrart fucks but he doesn't want pussy
[1:57:42] <+projectmanatees> Kim doesn‚Äôt trust him so I don‚Äôt trust him
[1:57:43] <%Blackleafx> @Kataguro he's gambling on it ending up poorly and wild pines cutting their ties with krenel
[1:57:48] <DSD24> My special policeboy
[1:57:49] <Yakobro> yes
[1:57:49] <ingman112> Yep
[1:57:49] <%xcompleasedad> @jorniev I agree
[1:57:50] <CappuccinoGuil> Evrart got us
[1:57:50] <+mczarklesby> So yeah how was THAT for a plan?
[1:57:51] <some_brave_apollo> yes
[1:57:51] <%hax_metatron> @jorniev And saved hundreds of lives

[1:57:56] <%R3Roundabout> yes
[1:57:57] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> yes
[1:57:57] <pi_in_the_sci> yes
[1:57:57] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[1:57:57] <%toastybites> yeah
[1:57:57] <cardamomo88> LUL
[1:57:57] <%walternatorz> do you want an honest answer?
[1:57:58] <ingman112> Check with him if you don't believe him
[1:57:58] <Estwilde> Probably
[1:57:58] <%ssjklyco> CuKnows

[1:58:08] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Cuno don't fucking care
[1:58:09] <sadboy_otoroshi> @emperri The pale is an existencial threat simliar to climate change but more enthropy-like.
[1:58:09] <%Mucmaster> Cuno does what he fucking wants
[1:58:10] <%Jeshk0> Cuno doesnt gve a fuck
[1:58:10] <%Dakuu75> Him and the new RE:Village merchant, are friends in my head.
[1:58:10] <%xcompleasedad> It will come up
[1:58:10] <+PMAvers> You think THE CUNO would lie to you about unimportant shit like that?
[1:58:12] <sirtommygunn> don't worry about it
[1:58:13] <%Kataguro> @Blackleafx That's assuming there's a harbor left by the time Krenel is gone
[1:58:14] <BerryliciousDefinition> Looks like you gotta go get it...
[1:58:15] <%Mendin> Ask Manananana
[1:58:16] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt You will want to talk to cindy to locate the next piece
[1:58:16] <Daxalog> Wait you almost got killed?
[1:58:18] <o2u4> of course he did, he's hardcore like that
[1:58:18] <Estwilde> Cuno doesn't fucking care
[1:58:19] <%Arancet> HARDCORE
[1:58:22] <IamGrapes> CUNO DOESNT LIE ABOUT KICKING HELMETS RUGBY STYLE
[1:58:24] <%Mendin> HARDCORE
[1:58:24] <+Joe2187> Wait...where did you find the gun?
[1:58:28] <$SGrim> @iosephe No, he's a sugma male

[1:58:39] <SomeAsianDood> Cuno doesn't fucking care
[1:58:40] <cardamomo88> LUL
[1:58:40] <+Soliloquy123> Fuck does Cuno care?
[1:58:41] <%Mendin> @Joe2187 Mr. Evrart helped him find his gun
[1:58:42] <user_naim> Cuno doesn‚Äôt   f u c k i n g care!
[1:58:44] <%walternatorz> cuno is a gang boss
[1:58:44] <Blank9> also, talk to lena in whirling in rags about her husband
[1:58:45] <%Ranryu692> it's too bad you can't just jump over to the apartment building balcony lol
[1:58:45] <%bassoontyphoon> Your Journal says to confront Cuno
[1:58:46] <%Dakuu75> Cuno is a kid on xbox live playing CoD
[1:58:46] <+mczarklesby> Also, doorbell if you have time.
[1:58:50] <+snarkilly1111> atpSuspect atpSuspect
[1:58:55] <+JustToWatch> like car batteries
[1:58:56] <Visorak6> Like car batteries?
[1:58:56] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt I think you can talk with the Hardie boys about the underground
[1:58:57] <%Blackleafx> CONFRONT THE CUNO
[1:59:01] <%toolofparanoia> KING CUNO
[1:59:03] <+emperri> @Blackleafx Yeah but it's not just him. Like even the bookstore woman: Bad mom with bad husband and a bad businesswoman? Or is it really just all the Pale's fault?
[1:59:06] <DSD24> Like Tom Cruise at the end of Top Gun?
[1:59:10] <+JobbedBone> early press materials for this game mention some CRAZY plot details that I never recall coming up
[1:59:18] <HeroToxiko> has cuuno gone full mole king?
[1:59:19] <sadboy_otoroshi> @dalmek You're so so kind, more than one would expect of chat.
[1:59:19] <%bassoontyphoon> it does in the chat function
[1:59:22] <%bassoontyphoon> sorry
[1:59:22] <nivlac_555> what?
[1:59:22] <CappuccinoGuil> THAT LITTLE SHIT!
[1:59:22] <General_Terro> YEAH
[1:59:23] <Hellarussian> GUN
[1:59:23] <thelonechris> YEYEYEY
[1:59:24] <dbag202> Let's KILL Cuno
[1:59:26] <+skyheys> YEEEEAH
[1:59:26] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> There's a guy at the FELD building you haven't spoken to yet.
[1:59:27] <Visorak6> Shoot him TWICE
[1:59:27] <%xcompleasedad> You can shoot Cunoese, I think
[1:59:28] <cardamomo88> YES SUM SAVE MURSER
[1:59:28] <%toolofparanoia> DESTROY THE CHILD
[1:59:28] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Yea yea
[1:59:29] <%AzureGale> That sounds like a route to a game over
[1:59:30] <Faded_Freedom> atpLaw atpWind
[1:59:30] <%Blackleafx> @Kataguro It seems pretty heavily implied that Evrart has way bigger guns than the Hardie boys. The Hardie boys seem like his first line of defence, but not the last.
[1:59:31] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Always choose violence
[1:59:32] <oda_flobunaga> You can shoot Cunoesse
[1:59:32] <Teras_ode> YEYE
[1:59:33] <%Jeshk0> shoot em all with a gun!
[1:59:34] <$Futurecity10> Oh yeah, why didnt you try and shoot cunoesse?
[1:59:35] <remainprofane> If you have never thrown something into a harbour, you gotta try it. Feels awesome
[1:59:36] <%Kataguro> Very easily
[1:59:43] <Teras_ode> DESTROY THE CHILD
[1:59:44] <IamGrapes> CUNO'S NOT AFRAID OF THE PIGS PEASHOOTER
[1:59:48] <%Jeshk0> nothing can beat GUN
[1:59:50] <Tracazoid> Take one bullet and shoot Cuno twice with it
[1:59:52] <remainprofane> Time to pass that composure check
[1:59:55] <%walternatorz> GET CUNO HOOKED ON FORTNITE
[1:59:55] <TheDeceasedJester> Shoot him. Shoot him now! Do it!
[1:59:57] <user_naim> @remainprofane ikr?
[1:59:58] <SomeAsianDood> @Kataguro not even first line of defence, just a figurehead line of defence
[1:59:58] <%dalmek> @sadboy_otoroshi tytyty. enjoy the stream and stuff
[2:00:02] <ingman112> Not even, 30 cents
[2:00:05] <Yakobro> 0.3 real
[2:00:06] <CappuccinoGuil> Chat, are postcards JUST for selling? Do they have any other function?
[2:00:06] <Teras_ode> time to use your "ONE" pat
[2:00:07] <%Blackleafx> @JobbedBone A lot of those are from the book, The Sacred and Terrible Air
[2:00:07] <Visorak6> 30 cents
[2:00:07] <+emperri> 30? LUL 0.30
[2:00:09] <+Soliloquy123> Throwing shit into the harbor rules and should be the origin of more countries
[2:00:18] <%Blackleafx> @CappuccinoGuil just for selling
[2:00:20] <Tisaric> the only thing I got was a sore as shit arm
[2:00:22] <ingman112> First shot's generally better. Second takes 6-12 hours to kick in if you get symptoms
[2:00:22] <ZE_Count> that 2nd shot put me out a day
[2:00:24] <%toolofparanoia> That means its working
[2:00:27] <%Maids4lyfe> man these edibles ain't shit
[2:00:27] <aiutare47> First shot is easier so I heard
[2:00:28] <%Cheeky_Cheekers> Cheeky_Cheekers subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[2:00:28] <remainprofane> Damn fucking straight
[2:00:28] <twohitgood> it doesn't hit you till 20 or so hours later.
[2:00:29] <%Monkeyweed21> talk to Lena too @PatStaresAt
[2:00:29] <CappuccinoGuil> @Blackleafx sick
[2:00:29] <Tisaric> I couldn't even sleep on the side I got my shot in

[2:00:32] <spuginky> Interfacing gooes up
[2:00:35] <%SveriSageAdvice> Pat dont crazy talk it
[2:00:38] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Second shot for me tomorrow!
[2:00:39] <%Uselesswhitenoise> Well less for the Variants
[2:00:44] <%Piemono> The 2nd shot is what usually fucks you up tho
[2:00:44] <Daxalog> @PatStaresAt In what stream did someone try to kill you?
[2:00:46] <Visorak6> I only have 70% or something from J&J but thats because the others would kill me, oh well
[2:00:47] <%Blackleafx> @JobbedBone I'd assume you're talking about stuff like the "end of the world"?
[2:00:51] <librettodude> Don't snake-eyes the corona roll
[2:00:56] <remainprofane> Find all sorts of sentimental shit buried in harbour beds. Also other shit. Don‚Äôt dive in harbours
[2:00:56] <ZE_Count> did windows update?
[2:00:57] <%Jeshk0> i got my first shot yesterday and my arm is still sore...
[2:01:00] <remainprofane> At least not mine
[2:01:01] <%Blackleafx> Pat, can we talk about stuff from the disco elysium book or is that spoilers
[2:01:01] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> the 5G is interfering with the game
[2:01:12] <%Blackleafx> or did plague already spoil you on it
[2:01:14] <sirtommygunn> i got my second shot a few days ago, excited to see my vaccinated friends this weekend

[2:03:08] <bettysharkface> I don't see it
[2:03:12] <LunarRemix> I had areas of the game straight up not render after a while
[2:03:15] <Timbroome> I had a similar problem in Shadowrun
[2:03:15] <%Blackleafx> murmurder
[2:03:22] <%Mucmaster> The 5g in pats arm is causing his tv to go haywire
[2:03:23] <remainprofane> It‚Äôs subtle

[2:03:38] <sadboy_otoroshi> Are they cursing saying  the F than A and G after that, word?
[2:03:42] <%SilvaChariot0133> Power Glove = cute.... huh
[2:03:47] <SomeAsianDood> That's your exposure to the pale @remainprofane

[2:04:29] <+emperri> the power glove is so bad
[2:04:30] <SomeAsianDood> Lily's sweet af. She gives you taxidermy and knows where the gloves are
[2:04:30] <+Soliloquy123> I like how "something beautiful is going to happen" can be interpreted as either a really positive message or an immensely threatening one
[2:04:31] <sadboy_otoroshi> Shit these kids
[2:04:35] <%bread_assassin> Fast travel is borked.
[2:04:40] <%Mendin> It broke and remains broke for like ever

[2:10:39] <%Mendin> I wonder if smokyboi has anything to say about the underground now
[2:10:41] <+Joe2187> Her husband sounds like that one animated australian cartoon show
[2:10:53] <remainprofane> He definitely does
[2:10:57] <%Mucmaster> Did Pat talk to the old man with a sandwich today?
[2:10:58] <some_brave_apollo> you didn't actually learn anyuthing though
[2:10:59] <%Blackleafx> Does Harry is the gay?
[2:11:02] <+Soliloquy123> Whaaaat
[2:11:03] <remainprofane> Oh he‚Äôs gonna love this
[2:11:07] <Blank9> hey ben
[2:11:08] <%AzureGale> I think the thought adds the dialogue option for Kim :x
[2:11:08] <Blank9> seeya
[2:11:09] <+mczarklesby> Also, that doomed building has a lovely doorbell that we haven't messed with.
[2:11:10] <%Blackleafx> @Mucmaster yea
[2:11:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> COPPERNADO
[2:11:12] <aiutare47> @Blackleafx Unknown
[2:11:18] <%xcompleasedad> Titus! Gay people are REAL!!!!
[2:11:19] <ingman112> This sounds like a false tip
[2:11:20] <%Kataguro> Coppergaydo
[2:11:25] <ZE_Count> I won't stand for this Bi erasure!
[2:11:26] <%AzureGale> I mean, just adds the dialogue option for Kim
[2:11:38] <%Blackleafx> Well somebody psa1guy 'd there being an option to talk with these guys about gay
[2:11:49] <remainprofane> Titus, are you a member of the homosexual underground
[2:11:49] <+Joe2187> Talk to old man on bench
[2:11:55] <ingman112> Ah well. Back to the coasy
[2:11:55] <%Monkeyweed21> aww he doesnt have enough empathy to get the secret line
[2:12:00] <ingman112> He already did
[2:12:02] <Blank9> Did you ever talk to that guy in front of the FELD building?
[2:12:03] <+mczarklesby> @Joe2187 he did.
[2:12:12] <+Soliloquy123> I figured smoking guy would have dialogue since he gives you the thought
[2:12:13] <%jorniev> oh you need empathy
[2:12:14] <%Blackleafx> Church time
[2:12:16] <%Mr_Pylon> and find the traps!
[2:12:16] <ZE_Count> church baby
[2:12:18] <+Joe2187> \Ah
[2:12:18] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I dunno if WDDC would make Pat like Encyclo or not.
[2:12:21] <ingman112> @Blank9 Not yet
[2:12:24] <remainprofane> No he walked by him I think
[2:12:24] <%NoHopeForMyCuirass> Mmm, I have some ravioli with fried zukes. A regular Italian I am, pizza pasta
[2:12:30] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> But he should still talk to the FELD guy.
[2:12:30] <%Blackleafx> WDDC?
[2:12:33] <ZE_Count> also a date once you explore
[2:12:35] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt If you have enough empathy and the underground thought you can figure out which one of the Hardie Boys is gay
[2:12:41] <%elhafnero> who buys postcards from a pawnshop
[2:12:48] <sadboy_otoroshi> Legendary success on perception to get a description on their feet odor. Cool...
[2:12:48] <IamGrapes> @NoHopeForMyCuirass that sounds legit good right now
[2:12:49] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Don't wanna spoil the name of the thought.
[2:12:50] <%arcielardor> Unfortunately the glove quest is glitched
[2:12:53] <%Blackleafx> @Monkeyweed21 spoilers: Its the gay one
[2:12:54] <remainprofane> Important information to the case
[2:13:06] <+Joe2187> Its worth it to buy the boom box
[2:13:14] <TioXyco> huh, Disco Elysium's money is called Real? unexpected
[2:13:18] <%Kataguro> WDDC is the strongest thing in the game
[2:13:19] <%NoHopeForMyCuirass> @NoHopeForMyCuirass Oh it's quite good
[2:13:22] <ingman112> I can
[2:13:24] <%Blackleafx> @Joe2187 dont we already have it
[2:13:31] <%Mucmaster> Trap there
[2:13:37] <+JobbedBone> "we‚Äôre a fresh team of some 11 dudes sitting in some (currently very cold) rooms in Tallinn, Estonia making the game in Unity.... The dream is to make a full form RPG after this one, but for now we consider No Truce a first bite. A smaller game to work out our big mechanics and storytelling methods." I wonder if this is still true
[2:13:38] <Blank9> 25% of your department's entire transportation budget
[2:13:40] <%Uselesswhitenoise> @PatStaresAt do you think after five or six normal playthroughs you'll try one where you cheat your stats to max to see how many words the game will say at you?
[2:13:42] <%AzureGale> @TioXyco Would you say it's... real unexpected
[2:13:44] <SomeAsianDood> he's already checked that trap
[2:13:52] <sadboy_otoroshi> @TioXyco Is that a real coin name?
[2:13:52] <%Kataguro> Kids with gloves.  Kids with gloves.
[2:13:54] <%arcielardor> @patstaresat The glove quest might still be glitched
[2:13:58] <TioXyco> @TioXyco Eeeeey.
[2:14:07] <Blank9> children are stupid

[2:30:45] <Gogo_cutler> My latest playthrough, I had high INT and I ended up getting very annoyed with encyclo late game. I know it has interesting things to say occasionally but I found 90 percent of the times it‚Äôs just impertinent trivia

[2:31:19] <%Blackleafx> @Gogo_cutler Encyclopedia is one of the few skills that just straight up fucks with you, like with the trivia test
[2:31:23] <SomeAsianDood> yes that's the point @Gogo_cutler
[2:31:23] <ingman112> @Gogo_cutler In fairness that's how information works. The vast majority of it is useless trivia; you've really got to piece through to find pertinent facts
[2:31:24] <+emperri> fuckin thing sucks
[2:31:25] <aiutare47> @Gogo_cutler some times the things it say end up being useful, but youd never know
[2:31:26] <+emperri> do it live

[2:46:41] <Visorak6> This is the most overpowered thought in the game @PatStaresAt fair warning
[2:46:42] <DSD24> This thought is a goozy
[2:46:43] <%Jeshk0> Wompty Dompty what the hell are yo u talking about??

[2:47:24] <+senfood> This conversation makes me hate Communism.
[2:47:27] <%Piemen99> @AvroEltz cause he's a nerd
[2:47:32] <Teras_ode> how high is this guy's encyclopedia even?
[2:47:32] <%Blackleafx> this guy IS encyclopedia
[2:47:36] <Hanyusha> imagine if your vcr tapes were the computer, essentially

[2:48:35] <Teras_ode> huh?
[2:48:40] <+emperri> highnessly
[2:48:42] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> WDDC gives you 10 exp and 2 real every time you get a new encyclopedia dialogue. It's my favorite thought in the game.
[2:48:43] <%bassoontyphoon> Oh shit Bill Gates is trying to ruin our stream with his 5G vaccine
[2:48:45] <%illusiveSaint> Hmm wym pick my brain
[2:48:45] <%Blackleafx> @Jeshk0 :)
[2:48:50] <+ThomasOfTroy> This is a great thought imo
[2:48:51] <doc_ock_rokc> @senfood samething happened in the Real world too. there was some astounding technological devolopments in Ukraine in the 30s that were similar to Enigma machine Rotter mechanisms but Then the Soviets came in and all that was destroyed

[2:49:14] <$RealThiele> writers: hello fellow children
[2:49:14] <Hanyusha> I thought it wasn't a real place
[2:49:17] <%hax_metatron> It's useless at this point in the game
[2:49:22] <ingman112> This you can save for later
[2:49:25] <%bread_assassin> @PatStaresAt Strongly recommend making room for that thought once you have an experience point.
[2:49:25] <+senfood> @doc_ock_rokc I had no clue! Thanks for the new info!
[2:49:27] <%Blackleafx> He can do it as long as he doesn't enter

[3:17:13] <%SharkMissile> SharkMissile subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months, currently on a 17 month streak! Zangief continues to enlargen, any worries you may be approaching a Clifford Kaiju situation?
[3:17:16] <%Blackleafx> @NoHopeForMyCuirass yo catholic mysticism is the shit
[3:17:24] <%jorniev> LIKE THE SONG!
[3:17:28] <%Kataguro> That's how you get cursed
[3:17:32] <%hax_metatron> Smallest Church in Saint Saens
[3:17:34] <punishedvenom1> This conversation is Probably my favorite piece of world building in the game
[3:17:35] <candidateplays> ...towards the seven sisters...
[3:17:38] <+titansloth93> I'm not religious anymore but being alone in a Catholic church still huts hard
[3:17:45] <Teras_ode> @senfood Yeah, if a person feels they've found a revelation about the world or discovered their purpose I would be interested in hearing how they got there
[3:17:46] <+senfood> Man, that is a sad modern myth.
[3:17:49] <%Pookiedaexzile> Catholic Mysticism? YOu mean when priests just started freestyling shit
[3:17:59] <%SharkMissile> The church has some of the best worldbuilding in the game, I love it so much.
[3:18:20] <akitanito> 41 fucks up everything
[3:18:28] <%toolofparanoia> ... did... did we do that?
[3:18:31] <+senfood> @Teras_ode Same. I've done it before but it always devolves into them trying to convert me. That's when I tap out.
[3:18:33] <%NoHopeForMyCuirass> @Blackleafx It's... okay. There's a deep ambivalence because why I stopped
[3:18:33] <%Blackleafx> @Pookiedaexzile historically, there's been a lot of chill priests who said "fuck the church" and preached more humanist things, tho admittedly that wasnt very catholic of them
[3:18:47] <cardamomo88> im not really religious anymore but  man i love buldings
[3:18:51] <+titansloth93> The thought of the guy who glued his eyes shut shooting this place up is a weird one

[3:24:46] <%Mucmaster> Is anything really real? Who can tell when a story is 1000 years old
[3:24:48] <bettysharkface> It's super implied she might be some kinda aliem.
[3:24:50] <%hax_metatron> This is all bullshit of the moralists
[3:24:53] <DSD24> You owe me AWE
[3:24:58] <+senfood> Oh my god, the cultural progression of this world is so fascinating.
[3:24:58] <+luketrapwalker> @RealThiele I understood that reference LUL
[3:25:07] <librettodude> >50% of the world decided "yeah this person is perfect"
[3:25:07] <%Blackleafx> @bettysharkface I think its less alien and more a supernatural part of the world
[3:25:12] <%hax_metatron> THIS WHOLE DIVINE LANGUAGE is just to cover up the Moralists' atrocities
[3:25:15] <cardamomo88> she was super jesus queen pope
[3:25:19] <%bugz_munny> EVERYONE was like YO THIS LADY
[3:25:28] <Yakobro> lmao 2
[3:25:31] <%Blackleafx> @hax_metatron based
[3:25:37] <+evbites> oh man harry is having a bad time
[3:25:41] <bettysharkface> @Blackleafx A cryptid shaped like a person
[3:25:42] <Lelfro> how does Harry know this to the detail?
[3:25:51] <KasiCrafter> This just sounds like a Mary Sue from this excessive praise.
[3:25:54] <DSD24> Harry read a book
[3:25:54] <notsoy> oh shit
[3:25:57] <trickster721> The heart as a symbol of love is arbitrary, it could just as easily be the lungs
[3:25:57] <shrikelazerusbrigade> Empress of Mankind
[3:25:59] <librettodude> "very well" monkaS
[3:26:02] <%Blackleafx> @Lelfro depression and projecting dolores onto his ex wife
[3:26:03] <fuji_92> Faith Cop?
[3:26:07] <+emperri> @bettysharkface I don't think it's supernatural, but evolution. "Oxygen extinction" etc
[3:26:07] <%jorniev> THIS DIALOGUE is incredible
[3:26:07] <%Kataguro> Yeah, why DOES he know?
[3:26:14] <some_brave_apollo> because its the relgion of the world
[3:26:14] <LunarRemix> He reads a lot of books and is actually a very smart person
[3:26:14] <+evbites> @Lelfro he's confusing her with his exwife
[3:26:18] <akitanito> because harry is actually a smart cop
[3:26:19] <oda_flobunaga> Depression obsession etc
[3:26:20] <cardamomo88> maybe he was a follower?
[3:26:21] <%AzureGale> Sealed information coming to light
[3:26:22] <primaryfire> wompty dompty would have been busted for this
[3:26:22] <televisedrevolting> Was he a moralist?
[3:26:23] <Ids560> she was like the most important person to exist
[3:26:23] <+ThomasOfTroy> This is literally the most important person in human history pat
[3:26:24] <%baka_sugoi> ?
[3:26:27] <hippofant> I mean, she's like the jesus of this time, isn't she? People would know?
[3:26:27] <%purps26> the world building in this game is so good
[3:26:29] <%Blackleafx> @bettysharkface oh man the oxygen extinction shit is WEIRD
[3:26:29] <%Jeshk0> Aliens?!?!?
[3:26:30] <%toolofparanoia> THIS IS LIKE GUILLIMAN'S CROWNING IN 40K
[3:26:32] <+JobbedBone> they're so important to the world I have a feeling EVERYONE knows this
[3:26:36] <+MightyDuckShoes> she's just Jesus
[3:26:38] <doc_ock_rokc> SHE IS THE FUCKING EMPORER
[3:26:38] <%jorniev> THAT is why technology seems so advanced and weird for the setting, INNOCENCES accelerate history for some reason
[3:26:39] <AngryAsian5> WHAT?
[3:26:40] <%MidnightBurst12> ???
[3:26:48] <cardamomo88> RIP
[3:26:48] <%MidnightBurst12> holy shit
[3:26:49] <%athuramn> a working theory: she's murdered because the she pushed the discovery of the isolas. because the isolas were formed from the pale being condensed, her persistent voyages forced a reality that served some ominous goal.
[3:26:57] <SilverFeng> android from the future
[3:26:58] <%Kataguro> Reptillians

[3:29:30] <Estwilde> I've been watching a lot of HistoryMarche. I feel like most armies of human history have been pretty 'righteously charged'

[3:32:35] <%athuramn> I think the more you discover of the pale, the more it wants to go back to state of undiscovery. that might be why she's a bit of a war criminal and started all the voyages - maybe she wants the world's ruin

[3:41:22] <+Smokebanshee> yeah heep it for a bit
[3:41:23] <Blank9> mazovian's gotten you enough exp already
[3:41:23] <%Mr_Pylon> Is Date of Birth pointless now?
[3:41:27] <+Smokebanshee> *keep
[3:41:29] <+Mickerus> maybe save some points for skills
[3:41:33] <penitentpendant> Check tasks to see if there's a check you want to reset?
[3:41:36] <candidateplays> Sel fcritique
[3:41:45] <%illusiveSaint> he finsihed communism quest?
[3:41:46] <ingman112> Don't delete mazovian
[3:41:46] <fedemachado96> gasp
[3:41:46] <%Pookiedaexzile> Dat of Birth
[3:41:51] <%walternatorz> NO MORE SORRY COP??
[3:41:52] <ZE_Count> have you read waste land?
[3:41:55] <%Kataguro> Yeah, you can still be Sorry
[3:41:56] <%walternatorz> I believe so
[3:41:57] <Blank9> you're eating -2 to stats from mazovian
[3:41:58] <ingman112> It's part of how the game tracks communism
[3:41:59] <oda_flobunaga> NO
[3:42:00] <+emperri> soarry
[3:42:00] <%Monkeyweed21> no
[3:42:01] <fedemachado96> yes
[3:42:01] <%illusiveSaint> rigourous works well with wastland i think
[3:42:03] <doc_ock_rokc> Soory cop
[3:42:05] <ingman112> I wouldn't delete rigorous
[3:42:07] <%bread_assassin> Rigourous self-critique ain't great.
[3:42:07] <+zinris> mazovian
[3:42:09] <%jorniev> why not date of birth
[3:42:14] <Blank9> you'll always be sorry cop if you make those dialogue choices
[3:42:19] <ZE_Count> thats good
[3:42:20] <%purps26> col do ma? you don't need more perception
[3:42:20] <ingman112> One of the two perception thoughts
[3:42:21] <%Kataguro> Date of Birth isn't giving you a ton
[3:42:22] <ZE_Count> make phs easier
[3:42:22] <aiutare47> that makes phys easier though
[3:42:22] <%walternatorz> Yeah, forget your birthday
[3:42:23] <%bassoontyphoon> Date@of birth?
[3:42:26] <%Ranryu692> Harry is only 9 years older than Pat
[3:42:29] <DSD24> But you are gonna forget your age again
[3:42:30] <remainprofane> Nothing could stop your ass from being sorry
[3:42:32] <candidateplays> That's great for Shivers checks
[3:42:32] <%SveriSageAdvice> yeah get rid of DOB generator
[3:42:33] <aiutare47> what does Apricot give you
[3:42:33] <%thetunnelhomer> Aces Low isn't that important
[3:42:34] <%Garthunox> i think sorry cop is tied to the points
[3:42:36] <%Mucmaster> You have stats for coppo types and political alignment outside of thought cabinet
[3:42:36] <ingman112> Date of Birth generator is the least useful
[3:42:39] <+JobbedBone> game isn't so hard that you need a full build though
[3:42:40] <+zinris> art degree kinda sucks too
[3:42:44] <%Mr_Pylon> Get rid of Birthdays forever
[3:42:48] <penitentpendant> Need the Kimpathy
[3:42:48] <%jorniev> LUL the art degree description again
[3:42:48] <%hax_metatron> Actually honestly, Womtpy is useless now Pat
[3:42:49] <%Mucmaster> Don't remove ace's low
[3:42:49] <%Uselesswhitenoise> we love kim
[3:42:51] <Yakobro> but KIM
[3:42:52] <+Rosy_Joan> @patstaresat u are Canadian
[3:42:53] <+icekept> date of birth
[3:42:53] <LeotheHuntsman> dont lose aces low
[3:42:53] <%Kataguro> Kimpathy is important
[3:42:55] <AvroEltz> Dont you dare take away aces low
[3:42:55] <candidateplays> Art Degree is amazing
[3:42:56] <%thetunnelhomer> Kim is 100% your bro already
[3:42:56] <+ThomasOfTroy> Drop DoB generator
[3:42:56] <Blank9> date of birth or mazovian aren't good now
[3:42:56] <%Ranryu692> keep Ace's low
[3:42:57] <cardamomo88> birhday gone
[3:42:57] <+mczarklesby> AKA Kimpathy.
[3:42:58] <KaiserMario> Aces low is needed
[3:42:59] <ingman112> DOB is unnecessary now that you know
[3:42:59] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> you need aces low
[3:43:01] <%illusiveSaint> keep it its important
[3:43:01] <%hax_metatron> Wompty is useless
[3:43:01] <%Ne1son> DOB
[3:43:02] <+cowkid222> we all love Kim
[3:43:04] <%sunsetdisc0> NEVER get rid of aces
[3:43:05] <aiutare47> its not really
[3:43:06] <+Rofiarf> its a bit late
[3:43:07] <%Monkeyweed21> date of birth gives you nothing @PatStaresAt
[3:43:08] <Archmortal> Date of Birth generator doesn't seem worth much
[3:43:09] <ZE_Count> well 80%
[3:43:09] <%Kataguro> Wompty Dompty is not useless
[3:43:10] <LunarRemix> You should probably get rid of date of birth generator
[3:43:11] <+wizard_of_diamonds> aye
[3:43:11] <Yakobro> I think so
[3:43:13] <+ThomasOfTroy> Wompty Dompty is still great
[3:43:13] <+icekept> DOB
[3:43:14] <%hax_metatron> You don't need money anymore
[3:43:15] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> No it's not, you still got time
[3:43:16] <%toolofparanoia> DO NOT DISAPOINT KIM-SAMA
[3:43:16] <+mczarklesby> It's still free XP and cash.
[3:43:18] <%Blackleafx> Late but not useless
[3:43:18] <candidateplays> Wompty is amazing
[3:43:19] <%SveriSageAdvice> yup
[3:43:19] <primaryfire> did you just see how much you went through at the stained glass?
[3:43:22] <%Ranryu692> yeah, date of birth is pointless now
[3:43:23] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It will give you more than 1 skillpoint
[3:43:24] <ZE_Count> date lowers all phys by -1
[3:43:25] <%hax_metatron> You have free home
[3:43:26] <Press_X_ToJASON> yeah, ideally you get wompty first thing day 3
[3:43:30] <%hax_metatron> No need for money or XP
[3:43:30] <DSD24> Man Harry just forgot his age again
[3:43:30] <Ids560> it is unfortunate how late you can get wompty
[3:43:33] <Lelfro> you forgot your birthday
[3:43:34] <AvroEltz> I TOLD YOU
[3:43:35] <+Rofiarf> no
[3:43:36] <fuji_92> one guy pat
[3:43:38] <%Garthunox> pretty much
[3:43:41] <Yakobro> yeah you'll make it
[3:43:44] <%sunsetdisc0> your birthday doesn't matter if you're never gonna die
[3:43:46] <LunarRemix> Pat there's still plenty of game left
[3:43:46] <penitentpendant> Gotta shotgun it to clear a slot for RE8
[3:43:46] <Blank9> you'll learn it
[3:43:46] <oda_flobunaga> Whompty will give you stuff right up till the end
[3:43:46] <primaryfire> you got a ton of dialogue left, wompty dompty will pay for itself multiple times over
[3:43:47] <cardamomo88> yes you have time
[3:43:47] <+Daedalus119> birthdays are for losers anyways
[3:43:48] <+zinris> you should just level up your stats
[3:43:49] <+evbites> @Lelfro ehhh
[3:44:02] <%Arancet> pat sure loves wasting his points on forgetting thoughts instead of raising stats
[3:44:09] <%bassoontyphoon> You still have a LOT of game
[3:44:13] <%jorniev> 1

[3:44:16] <+evbites> oh harry....
[3:44:18] <+JobbedBone> can you just use a book to waste time?
[3:44:19] <ingman112> Reaction speed is like a kid
[3:44:19] <RedPlasticCup> win her back
[3:44:21] <Dabrikishaw> You can get all the Wompty checks from reading old dialogues.
[3:44:22] <user_naim> reaction speed grasping for straws
[3:44:26] <doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Did you see the Disco elysium pictures I made of you paige and Woolie?
[3:44:27] <$ItsRatman> Surely.
[3:44:32] <%Jeshk0> Dont. Think. About. It.

[3:45:23] <%Pookiedaexzile> Timebomb?
[3:45:24] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> New encyclopedia checks from old dialogues trigger Wompty Dompty. Leveling up encyclo once and wearing the hat might be worth it.
[3:45:28] <+evbites> FUTURE WEIRDNESS
[3:45:30] <%MidnightBurst12> oh boy
[3:45:33] <oda_flobunaga> That will go somewhere...

[3:49:24] <%Blackleafx> is thiis why this story exists
[3:49:29] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> "Harry, who's Kim? Who have you been talking to?"
[3:49:34] <aiutare47> Possibly

[3:58:32] <librettodude> light stretching should help with the dull ache
[3:58:35] <+emperri> Oh yeah that shut hurts
[3:58:37] <Yinlock> what does anything mean man
[3:58:46] <remainprofane> Understandable have a great day
[3:58:47] <%illusiveSaint> modCheck wym hole in the world
[3:58:49] <%Ynkubus_> @Blackleafx eh, leeches will fix it
[3:58:53] <+mczarklesby> THIS lady believes in space.
[3:59:00] <%jorniev> SO SMART
[3:59:00] <%Blackleafx> :)
[3:59:12] <+emperri> CONTACT MIKE
[3:59:13] <librettodude> your shoulder and neck is likely to tense up as your arm continues to hurt, tho
[3:59:13] <%Blackleafx> @mczarklesby you mean nighttime?
[3:59:21] <%GarbageNirvana> I wonder if that's a part of the pale skipping through the cracks of reality
[3:59:28] <%Pookiedaexzile> If the Pale has just been space this whole time Imma be pissed
[3:59:28] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Smart money strikes again
[3:59:29] <%GarbageNirvana> *slipping even
[3:59:31] <+JobbedBone> leeches will only help if you have hemochromatosis
[3:59:40] <+frobotmk2> LUL
[3:59:42] <Blank9> honestly moving my arm didn't help at all with the vaccine soreness, it just had to work it's course over 2 days
[3:59:52] <%Blackleafx> yo anybody who actually knows shit whats good to do after the vaccine lol
[3:59:57] <%Blackleafx> im getting mine in a month or so
[4:00:06] <Yinlock> i'll tell you why your research is going nowhere: you don't believe in ghost science
[4:00:08] <akitanito> take rest
[4:00:11] <%X2Eliah> Heey Pasta
[4:00:14] <%Blackleafx> im seeing a LOT of different takes on what pat should do
[4:00:16] <librettodude> @Blackleafx drink water and sleep honestly
[4:00:23] <+JobbedBone> if pale were just space, interistolatary travel wouldn't be so hard
[4:00:25] <%MidnightBurst12> Oh god. It's real
[4:00:30] <aiutare47> @Blackleafx Rest. Drink water. Dont lift with your arm but do move or massage it.
[4:00:31] <Yinlock> move your arm a little and also not at all
[4:00:41] <ingman112> @Blackleafx Drink lots of fluids, stretch your arm to avoid soreness, hold out as long as possible before taking tylenol (but eventually take some). And sleep
[4:00:43] <%elhafnero> nananananananana crab man
[4:00:45] <Blank9> it'll just go away after a day or two
[4:00:47] <librettodude> if your arm hurts, though, light stretching helps stave off the stiffness you'll start to get
[4:01:02] <+emperri> anyone else getting an echo
[4:01:15] <%X2Eliah> Wit hthe arm stuff, you do want to encourage some circulation it it with at least light movement.
[4:01:17] <Blank9> nah
[4:01:19] <%GarbageNirvana> The pale can't just be space, because space can be measured
[4:01:27] <%Grimlockfly> She‚Äôs so much better with voice acting
[4:01:27] <akitanito> true
[4:01:27] <%Blackleafx> gotcha. The contrary takes people were sending pat made my head hurt, but thats a better idea of what i should prepare for
[4:01:27] <+emperri> hm
[4:01:28] <%maenos2> LUL
[4:01:31] <aiutare47> oh fuck yeah I forgot. Avoid NSAIDs if you can. The literature isnt super concrete but its best to avoid them
[4:01:34] <%elhafnero> yeah i rotated my arm a bit and that seemed to help
[4:01:43] <%Blackleafx> anyway time for HARDCORE
[4:01:49] <%Ranryu692> Pat wants a petting zoo
[4:02:00] <cardamomo88> H A R C O R E
[4:02:05] <librettodude> Oh, yeah, avoid painkillers unless you *need* them for the pain
[4:02:09] <LunarRemix> This conversation is weird because you already know they want a drug lab
[4:02:09] <Yakobro> HARDCORE
[4:02:13] <+VictoryDonut> is FF14 still worth getting into as a newbie?

[4:02:29] <%Uselesswhitenoise> yeah hes a ginger
[4:02:30] <+Daedalus119> as a ginger, pat is resistant to painkillers
[4:02:31] <%illusiveSaint> i thought we established their ulterior motives lol
[4:02:32] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Pat, have some water and walk your dog.
[4:02:32] <%TheLakinessMonster> Red head anti drug powers
[4:02:32] <Make_me_mad> My doctor straight up told me to take a bunch of painkillers after shot 2.
[4:02:33] <%Pookiedaexzile> He's Ginger
[4:02:34] <librettodude> oh yeah, fair
[4:02:36] <akitanito> it's just a sore arm anyway
[4:02:36] <lol_red_ranger> get drunk as a joke haha
[4:02:37] <doc_ock_rokc> oh did pat get his shot today?
[4:02:37] <$ItsRatman> Oh right Pat has Painkiller resistance
[4:02:37] <%X2Eliah> Painkillers are a lie
[4:02:38] <%Mucmaster> Pat has ginger genes. Pain killers don't work
[4:02:38] <RedPlasticCup> hardcore to the mega
[4:02:38] <%elhafnero> Port Harcore
[4:02:39] <+JobbedBone> they mean for post vaccine stuff
[4:02:41] <Make_me_mad> Specifically recommended ibuprofen.
[4:02:41] <%Piemono> Pat is immune to pain refief
[4:02:42] <penitentpendant> @VictoryDonut Depends if you like Hotbar MMOs or not
[4:02:43] <Yinlock> @librettodude isn't that how you should treat painkillers normally
[4:02:43] <%Monkeyweed21> Just smoke a fat kermit blunt
[4:02:44] <+mczarklesby> Yeah apparently the painkillers can surpress the immune response? This is just something I read I am not a doctor and I got no clue.
[4:02:45] <vile_brand> rub your arm. frequently

[4:02:55] <%Pookiedaexzile> quite literally so built differently he got a red color swap
[4:03:00] <%bassoontyphoon> Pats a ginger he has +5 resistance to drugs
[4:03:01] <+Daedalus119> @Yinlock true
[4:03:01] <aiutare47> NSAIDs seem to have weird interactions with the vaccine but data is kinda all over
[4:03:02] <%Urgotfantasy> They don't weaken immune response
[4:03:03] <Yinlock> build a small bed for your arm
[4:03:03] <+evbites> poor paige
[4:03:05] <%jorniev> HE already did this part of the quest right?
[4:03:05] <remainprofane> Have you tried screaming a little?
[4:03:05] <librettodude> @Yinlock Some people take painkillers pre-emptively or at the first sign of pain
[4:03:06] <IamGrapes> put some frozen veggies on your arm
[4:03:06] <Sartastic> cause of the gingervitis
[4:03:11] <remainprofane> Just a little
[4:03:13] <%Urgotfantasy> Tylenol and ibuprofen are fine
[4:03:24] <+VictoryDonut> @penitentpendant thanks man, not really but i cant wait for 16
[4:03:39] <aiutare47> @Urgotfantasy Really? we were told the opposite
[4:03:55] <ingman112> Definitively, you do not want to take any medication before the vaccine. After is more hazy
[4:03:55] <+evbites> that's a conversation piece
[4:03:57] <Yinlock> some spiritual weirdo climbing the rafters seems like a fuckin party
[4:04:00] <%Urgotfantasy> That's latest CDC guidelines
[4:04:01] <%Urgotfantasy> Weird
[4:04:06] <%Blackleafx> YEAH THAT SHIT WILL FUCK YOUR LIVER
[4:04:07] <%hax_metatron> The crabman lives in your house now accept it
[4:04:14] <$Hzealot> did pat get a shot?
[4:04:16] <vile_brand> i was told ONLY tylenol
[4:04:16] <ZE_Count> god I love egg head
[4:04:21] <Wolfwood315> ibuprofen is terrible for your liver
[4:04:21] <televisedrevolting> God I love Egghead
[4:04:23] <%Piemono> Weird my dude said ibuprofen would be fine
[4:04:24] <librettodude> Standard painkillers can fuck you up depending what's coursing through your system
[4:04:24] <televisedrevolting> Jinx
[4:04:25] <Make_me_mad> The nurse who gave me the shot explicitly told me to take ibuprofen.
[4:04:27] <+kewlmyc> Yeah, I was told to just take Tylenol with the shot
[4:04:28] <wolfen091> HARDCORE TO THE MEGA
[4:04:29] <+Daedalus119> ibuprofen is an nsaid, only tylenol is ok
[4:04:32] <%Jeshk0> yeah i cant take NSAIDs with my meds bc itll fuck me up
[4:04:33] <%X2Eliah> @Hzealot Nah, but he did get the Bill Gates 5G tracker
[4:04:35] <+transporterthesequel> Oh pat got THE JUICE grats on JUICE
[4:04:39] <%GarbageNirvana> Like the interaction between them messes it up?
[4:04:44] <Archmortal> is it JUST ibuprofen or general anti-inflammatory meds?
[4:04:46] <oda_flobunaga> Hammer to the temple is pretty healthy
[4:04:49] <dmtjinni> LUL LUL LUL
[4:04:59] <aiutare47> I read some lit back in the beginning when we were jabbing elderly not to recommend NSAIDs because it would probably interact
[4:05:03] <dmtjinni> Noid is best boi
[4:05:03] <Blank9> just don't take anything
[4:05:03] <%andresisant> 1
[4:05:05] <ingman112> My reading has been wait as long as possible, til the symptoms are at their worst, then take Tylenol (don't fuck with too much else)
[4:05:08] <%Jeshk0> THE LAW
[4:05:09] <AvroEltz> 1

[4:14:57] <%Puhff> !uptime
[4:14:58] <@Moobot> @Puhff I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 15m.
[4:15:04] <doc_ock_rokc> I got my second one thursday
[4:15:08] <doc_ock_rokc> and it wiped me out
[4:15:28] <%jorniev> the crowbar multi tool looks so much like the juckyard dog
[4:15:33] <%Monkeyweed21> @IamGrapes yea its bad congestion, maybe some chills and a headache for like a day or two
[4:15:37] <aiutare47> I got the J&J and that was easily the sickest ive been in my life
[4:15:40] <Tisaric> I couldn't sleep on the side I got my first one in
[4:15:41] <fritz_dacat> He's been at the Disco for to long gotta pace yourself
[4:15:48] <aiutare47> get some rest, drink water, massage arm, pet babies. Remember even the second one is better than being dead.
[4:15:52] <Blank9> I've got another week til my second one, here's hoping it's just a sore arm again
[4:15:53] <%walternatorz> Pat, you've stared too long!
[4:15:57] <%jorniev> you look dead tired
[4:15:59] <%DEETRz> the second one is absolutely brutal
[4:15:59] <ammobasket> My second gave me night sweats and sensitive skin, but just for the one day. Advil helped kick it
[4:16:00] <IamGrapes> @Monkeyweed21 yeah, i got that pretty bad the first night i got it
[4:16:03] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt your left eye looked fucked
[4:16:04] <Estwilde> Better than actually having the real deal fever. That was a terrible 2 weeks
