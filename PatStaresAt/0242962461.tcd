[0:01:38] <%Jpdodds> I got a P5 CD for Christmas. Any Houston TX bois know that driving on I-45 at night is a real trip, but put on thi song, and you're all good.
[0:01:40] <HellboundHeartless> best P5 song
[0:01:40] <ckangaroo15k> I only know, like 5 frames...
[0:01:45] <CronoMagnum> @AirlineFood74 Valkyr for life
[0:01:46] <GurrenPrime> I've got some prime parts from voids
[0:01:49] <%easternstealth> ayy
[0:01:52] <prime_name> Who wants to talk about Kratos?
[0:01:52] <Ichigo247> hello
[0:01:53] <ckangaroo15k> But I started with Loki so that's it.
[0:01:55] <$TheSniperJoe> I could use some good Pat streaming to wash the taste of Pacific Rim out of my mouth.
[0:01:59] <@thenefftw> @ckangaroo15k Say Limbo. He's a time stop boi
[0:02:02] <$serpenttucker> Remember, Kratos's family shouldn't have looked his way.
[0:02:03] <Inebriateddonut> @GurrenPrime basically have a bunch of prime parts that you sell for cheap as a bundle
[0:02:07] <BaronVonWolfe> Ok, I'm all lubed up and ready to go.
[0:02:09] <+migofrompluto> The only reason I scan plants now is to get the mods from the Titania areas.
[0:02:12] <%ECRead> apatMenace apatMenace apatMenace
[0:02:13] <Domonomin> was pacific rim bad?
[0:02:13] <%breakfastmegapowers> Man Pat is so hawt when Paige is not around. Its Paige's fault for being way hotter than Boivania
[0:02:13] <ckangaroo15k> @thenefftw Yeah, that gets my dick hard.
[0:02:19] <capsteez1> Oof the p rim movie
[0:02:22] <GimmieGarbage> awww yeah, time to shit it up
[0:02:27] <%xemnahort> @jpdodds and then When mother was there plays and you start crying
[0:02:27] <Inebriateddonut> @GurrenPrime usual rate I see is 5 parts for 10 platI think?
[0:02:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> aw ye oberon time, unkillable goatman
[0:02:29] <Ichigo247> Kratos family shouldnt have prayed in a temple
[0:02:37] <AirlineFood74> [kratos ignores the dying crying of child begging him to stop as he guns down a wedding crowd scarface style]
[0:02:40] <AirlineFood74> "YOU DID THIS!"
[0:02:43] <GurrenPrime> do i just go to inventory to sell them for plat? @inebriateddonut
[0:02:49] <+OccasionalGoldfish> I think I like the rain variant of this song better
[0:02:52] <ckangaroo15k> @GurrenPrime Go on the warframe marketplace site and find an average price. Some that are more rare go for 15-20 plat for a single part, I sold one for 4 the other day.
[0:02:53] <+AurumReaps> It's so nice of Pat to let matt cameo in this as an actual Skeleton
[0:02:53] <$serpenttucker> @Ichigo247 It's kratos's family's fault for existing.
[0:02:54] <%Aggro_Will> Kratos is a worse video game father than Heichachi Mishima.
[0:02:55] <+mugido> What happened to the tempered diviljho quest? I can’t find it D;
[0:02:57] <+MarshallLee67> why'd all these people get in the way of the bullets i was shooting ffs
[0:03:03] <%TheBigO75> Has pat found his new crack?
[0:03:09] <resident_evil545> Has anyone here played and beaten a way out?
[0:03:10] <%TheBigO75> ffjffjfj
[0:03:11] <Inebriateddonut> @GurrenPrime oh no you gotta go trade with people. Just go into trade chat and advertise and you should be able to get a buyer
[0:03:12] <KwakuAnansi> Maybe
[0:03:14] <%flying_hipp0> woo
[0:03:14] <AirlineFood74> @mugido it's in events, not sure if you looked there already
[0:03:15] <%breakfastmegapowers> Pacific Rim 3 will star Pamela Anderson as the clone of Mako from Pacific Rim
[0:03:15] <GurrenPrime> ah okay I'll check that out @ckangaroo15k
[0:03:15] <thelonechris> Remember that one time Kratos burnt down that orphanage?
[0:03:16] <+TardyClock> I mean to be fair to Kratos, it was a war and stuff.
[0:03:16] <Everpresent_Overseer> You know it's time to give up when there is a Vay Hek boss fight Sortie with Melee Only
[0:03:20] <+thedustyblack> hey hey chat are the warframe servers still getting fucked
[0:03:25] <%Jpdodds> @xemnahort That one doesn't get my like that Opera-y song on disc 1
[0:03:28] <+mugido> It’s gone from events menu
[0:03:28] <Everpresent_Overseer> Servers are fine now
[0:03:29] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @TheBigO75 I mean he's only like 50-70 hours in.
[0:03:32] <Inebriateddonut> @GurrenPrime especially since the void trader is here right now
[0:03:33] <Rogue657> @thedustyblack they've been working for a few hours now
[0:03:33] <+thedustyblack> sweet
[0:03:34] <+Highimbrighton> Hey guys serious question: How do I unsubscribe from a monthly subscription and get my money back?
[0:03:34] <ckangaroo15k> @GurrenPrime You have to manually initiate a trade with another player. The Maroo Bazaar is the best place to go, since you can literally set up shot.
[0:03:35] <+TardyClock> It's not like he was any worse than most of the other dudes around, he never had the moral highground or anything.
[0:03:36] <Huntercd> Will Paige be here?
[0:03:36] <Ichigo247> so how long till Pat gets his own glyph ?
[0:03:38] <AirlineFood74> oh rip
[0:03:40] <GurrenPrime> okay, i haven't played in like three years so this stuff is new to me
[0:03:42] <ckangaroo15k> @GurrenPrime shop*
[0:03:45] <+ssjklyco> @serpenttucker Its also the gods faulty for giving him god powers instead of letting him kill himself.
[0:03:49] <+thedustyblack> i literally just got gara when the ddos'ing started
[0:03:55] <capsteez1> Give em two more streams
[0:04:00] <ckangaroo15k> @GurrenPrime Same lol, started up again a week ago.
[0:04:07] <%breakfastmegapowers> Hey lets hope that the Warframe servers are fucked so he plays Rocket Knight Adventures instead
[0:04:09] <$serpenttucker> @ssjklyco It's the barbarian's fault for nearly killing him to begin with
[0:04:13] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @GurrenPrime It's fair to say this may as well be a different game all together.
[0:04:15] <Klayton119> What's the song?
[0:04:16] <Ichigo247> the podcast got me excited enough to jump back
[0:04:25] <GurrenPrime> had to quit because the ship update ran poorly on my old pc
[0:04:25] <KwakuAnansi> What is the reason behind the Ddos?
[0:04:26] <Ichigo247> check news: 1hr ago server problems
[0:04:28] <Rogue657> @Klayton119 Beneath the Mask - Persona 5
[0:04:37] <GurrenPrime> got a new rig so i figured this was the best time
[0:04:42] <+pantsureaper> Holy shit Pat plays warframe?
[0:04:46] <AirlineFood74> @Ichigo247 i'm a same boy. I miss being able to buy blueprints from the market though :(
[0:04:47] <+migofrompluto> Typically people have access to a dojo and you trade there. I've never done Maroo's Bazaar and set myself up as a trader though.
[0:04:49] <GurrenPrime> @lordspooklekins yeah sure as hell feels like it
[0:04:54] <%Aggro_Will> @breakfastmegapowers Fuck, I want to see a Rocket Knight Adventures stream now.
[0:04:54] <GimmieGarbage> I set up an account during server problems, forgot my password, AND made up a random birthday when I created an account.... I'm never playing Warframe
[0:04:55] <capsteez1> Fuck gara took me a while to grind I don't even want to use
[0:04:55] <%breakfastmegapowers> In Warframe it plays you
[0:04:57] <AirlineFood74> @pantsureaper as of 2 weeks ago
[0:04:59] <Worldbrand> I've been out all day, are the servers still on fire?
[0:05:00] <+ChocalateDog203> finally i catch a warframe stream
[0:05:02] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> I can't wait to yell at pat and say how wrong he is
[0:05:07] <%Jpdodds> @pantsureaper Where have you been?
[0:05:08] <Everpresent_Overseer> @pantsureaper He just started not too long ago
[0:05:10] <+ssjklyco> @serpenttucker No, that was still Kratos' fault for going "no, I wanna live!"
[0:05:14] <+TardyClock> I just realized that Elmo has a fucking boxcutter in this animation.
[0:05:15] <Inebriateddonut> @AirlineFood74 wait, but you can still do that tho?
[0:05:26] <Ichigo247> @AirlineFood74 you still can, it's one more step obscured
[0:05:27] <+pantsureaper> @AirlineFood74 Oh I've been hearing him talk about Warframe YEAAARS ago
[0:05:27] <ckangaroo15k> Ey?

[0:11:33] <+MetalPanic> the coupon is trying to fight you
[0:11:34] <Zombrocom> @AngriestPat Don't worry about Rivens. Ignore that, it's not important
[0:11:35] <%Kage_96> @AngriestPat if they are going to just give you coupons out the gate just wait till the 75% since you will get it soon probably.
[0:11:36] <AirlineFood74> SPOILERS ASSHOLES

[0:11:37] <TheInkshow> LUL
[0:11:38] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat Riven mods are random mods made of 2-4 combined existing mods and have random properties for a single weapon
[0:11:38] <+M3grim> Riven mods are complicated, don't worry about them for now
[0:11:38] <fjarcob> Rivens are cancer
[0:11:40] <turf_wind_and_fire> Well you should buy them
[0:11:41] <+Zundelle> riven mods are very scary and very mysterious
[0:11:41] <Mittensbro> it is hilariously easy to spoil this game that doesn't have a story
[0:11:41] <%Aggro_Will> @AngriestPat I just clipped your economics lesson for the subreddit. THE WORLD NEEDS TO KNOW HOW TO FREE MONEY.
[0:11:41] <+Thraxishunter> You can’t use them yet pat

[0:11:43] <Jetleo1> Riven Mods are hyper mods for specific weapons that do crazy things but have to be activated by doing a challenge first.
[0:11:44] <GurrenPrime> @airlinefood74 he has the tentacle thing right?
[0:11:47] <+dickbuttwoman> The void giveth and the void taketh away

[0:12:59] <+migofrompluto> You won't likely get to Second Dream or The War Within until like 100 hours right?
[0:13:04] <resident_evil545> Have you played A Way Out yet?
[0:13:04] <%InsomniacPersona> @AngriestPat you and paige should co-op a way out if it aint goin on the channel

[0:18:21] <TyrantBelial> FOR MORE SLOTS
[0:18:22] <PowerArmorMeow> LUL
[0:18:22] <@PlagueOfGripes> that's not alarming. what's alarming is that Paige is just like your mother
[0:18:22] <Twoiis> Shoes are hot.
[0:18:22] <TyrantBelial> AND COSMETICS
[0:18:24] <%maskedriderhero> Dont let it set in
[0:18:24] <CronoMagnum> VoteYea
[0:18:26] <+pantsureaper> PAT DON'T DO IT
[0:18:26] <TyrantBelial> YOU WILL BE SPENDING MONEY ANYWAYS
[0:18:27] <Spydurman> but once it's digital money sales it makes sense
[0:18:27] <arcadeHemorrhage > YOU GOT RINO :D
[0:18:27] <+Camail> pat you've said hi like 5 fucking times
[0:18:27] <%legendfather_of_giants> @GurrenPrime yeah, build the light side frame and dark side frame, then build the full frame
[0:18:28] <count_bob> Your mom doesn't watch this stream, does she?

[0:18:30] <%easternstealth> apatWrong

[0:18:38] <+Zundelle> I cannot believe I enhanced my life for negative money by buying this purse
[0:18:39] <Katalist_> dont think about how much like your parents you are
[0:18:41] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> THAT MONEY IS BASICALLY RUNNING AWAY IF YOU DON'T BUY IT
[0:18:41] <%electrokev007> jesus christ Plague
[0:18:42] <+AntithesisEK> big value big losses
[0:18:44] <alex_id> YOU DESERVE IT
[0:18:44] <+didyouthinkofthis> @AngriestPat it will make the game more enjoyable if you dont have to worry about running out of slots
[0:18:44] <%Dingus_Tickler> @plagueofgripes Like mother, like Sister
[0:18:45] <cereal_box_conspiracy> A bar might have a sign that says "6 to 9 is happy hour: all drinks half off!" That's literally the same thing as saying "all drinks after 9 oclock are twice as expensive." But if I advertised the second one people would be like "fuck this bar."
[0:18:45] <voisraikien> PLEASE DONT DO THIS
[0:18:46] <+ssjklyco> He's one step away from sitting at his table for hours cutting grocery coupons out of the news papers
[0:18:47] <Jackgar> @PlagueOfGripes Is it, though? A lot of men end up attracted to women who are like their mothers
[0:18:47] <+axellogic> I think chat wants scumplat
[0:18:48] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> Time for Pat to be wrong!

[0:18:50] <+Stinzik> WarFarm
[0:18:50] <Xiangchang> So, how was Tempered Deviljho?
[0:18:51] <ckangaroo15k> @PlagueOfGripes But isn't that Oedipus Syndrome and shit? How guys tend to find girls who are like their mothers?
[0:18:51] <%ssaryn> Ni No Kuni II is SO MUCH BETTER.
[0:18:53] <mrdazg> ANYWAY BUY THE PLA
[0:18:54] <AirlineFood74> FRAMING PAIGE FOR MURDER
[0:18:58] <+magikestral> @angriestpat 2 is way better, based on what i heard
[0:18:59] <+The_MadDoge> ITS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
[0:19:00] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat im ready to yell at your Oberon play
[0:19:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> farming ? plague ?
[0:19:01] <%Cadwae> @AngriestPat it is totally different in combat and such
[0:19:02] <Bealy_beal> Play the game! Play the game! Play the game!
[0:19:03] <Bazookya> so pats balls deep in warframe now?
[0:19:03] <+GreatBrightBlack> You get to shoot furries with guns
[0:19:04] <ArcTundra> buy plat
[0:19:05] <+TeethMuncher> Nino cuite
[0:19:06] <+ssjklyco> Ni No kuni had one too many mechanics
[0:19:06] <GurrenPrime> i got the Lisa Simpson keychain for free
[0:19:07] <Bazookya> oh, i guess not
[0:19:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Also i'm mastery nineteen and I have spent $20 total
[0:19:12] <%CarlosEoM> it didnt have lootboxes
[0:19:15] <+eXtwofour> !uptime
[0:19:16] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 19m 24s.
[0:19:16] <%maskedriderhero> @AngriestPat I realized Paige actually CANNOT play Okami, she would not be able to do the Blockhead puzzles
[0:19:16] <+McSoliace> everyone tried Nino Kuni 1
[0:19:20] <Jackgar> @Xiangchang He was fun. TOUGH! But fun. Streamstones are nice, too. I hope they bring it back for Spring Festival
[0:19:21] <$HowIPendragon> 2 is way underwhelming
[0:19:22] <ragasquid> this is irrelevant but why does everyone hate abby from giant bomb?
[0:19:23] <ArcTundra> 50% off is a good deal
[0:19:24] <+The_MadDoge> Ni no kuni 2 its COMPLETELY different from 1
[0:19:24] <Daxalog> So Oberon is currently being Forged. It better be the best most fun frame ever or im gonna drop this
[0:19:24] <+D4C_Trice> They might of gotten rid of the pokemon in ni no kuni 2
[0:19:25] <TheManofManyQuestions> If i really wanna play one frame should i just buy it?
[0:19:26] <%ssaryn> Combat is SUPER improved in 2.
[0:19:30] <AirlineFood74> BECAUSE SHE'S TRASH
[0:19:31] <Huntercd> Is that where Paige got those ugly boots?
[0:19:31] <+dmviewerguy> the lisa simpson keychain is worth at least $1000, youd be silly not to buy it
[0:19:32] <+Flamekidx> ninja's get great savings on fake currency
[0:19:33] <umbypokochan> i bought Ni no kuni 1 and never played it lol
[0:19:34] <+migofrompluto> Does he know he can customize the interior of his ship colors and decos?
[0:19:38] <MonsterEnvy> cheer200 Hey Pat just a curiosity question saw that Matt and Woolie checked out Iconcolasts from the vid they released, Was curious if you checked it out or planned to?
[0:19:39] <PowerArmorMeow> @AngriestPat How far are you into Warframe?
[0:19:41] <arcadeHemorrhage > Did pat get the space aids yet???
[0:19:42] <Divryne> Pay-to-enlarge-your-DICK.
[0:19:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> T H O T B E G O N E
[0:19:43] <OceanGovernor> @TheManofManyQuestions getting the frame is half the fun
[0:19:44] <+ssjklyco> You can't spell play with out pay.
[0:19:44] <blaccbird914> Nino kuni was ruined for me when i discovered toko farmer
[0:19:46] <Louie_Salmon> Ni no kuni is just so damn long
[0:19:48] <DarkSkyKing> @AngriestPat Because you and liam got me into XIV. I checked out Warframe cause the stuff you said it was good on the podcast. This is all your fault.
[0:19:51] <+GreatBrightBlack> It transitioned from Pokemon to FF15
[0:19:51] <sirrice77> @TheManofManyQuestions probably not unless its a huge pain to get
[0:19:51] <blaccbird914> farming
[0:19:52] <AirlineFood74> I WISH
[0:19:55] <drakthebest> @AngriestPat You don't really need weapon slots yet. You won't find anything better than the dex weapons for a very long time, so you can just level anything you want, sell it, and keep the dex weapons for emergencies
[0:19:58] <%breakfastmegapowers> Ni No Kuni 2 might as well not be a sequel, Its like Final Fantasy where the name is the only thread
[0:19:58] <turf_wind_and_fire> More like free to pay amiright?!?!
[0:20:00] <%SickBangerzM9> Can i play it with a steering wheel?
[0:20:00] <+TardyClock> Oh shit I have the same mouse as Pat
[0:20:00] <Bazookya> pat, what if i told you i could body you in 3s?
[0:20:04] <booterdagg> only mouse. no keyboard.

[0:20:13] <+GreatBrightBlack> And you get to shoot furries
[0:20:17] <BadgerDK> close it!
[0:20:18] <+D4C_Trice> The new mechanics at every chapter turned me off of ni no kuni
[0:20:20] <%Dingus_Tickler> What about a trackball?

[0:20:56] <deviljhojho94> pat you need to kill them
[0:20:57] <+dickbuttwoman> Relics are technically loot boxes, but like... don't buy those you crazy
[0:20:58] <$SGrim> @ckangaroo15k I played a space combat section with a flight stick, so it should be possible.
[0:21:00] <%Dingus_Tickler> Can I play it with an N64 Controller?
[0:21:02] <sunriser696> relics are kinda of lootboxes
[0:21:03] <%breakfastmegapowers> I NEED THE STEEL BATTALION CONTROLLER FOR EVERYTHING BECAUSE I LOOK LIKE A JACKASS
[0:21:05] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> With the 60% savings for 4500 plat they are basically paying you to buy their money

[0:29:54] <Rivalshotzgp> @certainlysyrix ivara is overdramatized and Altus just requires grinding archwing stuff first
[0:29:54] <%s_xylocalsingles> Let it set in
[0:29:54] <grayjammer> Uhhhhhhhh go tho a psychiatrist to unlearn that shit, man
[0:29:55] <Divryne> SPONSORSHIP.
[0:29:55] <deviljhojho94> MMM GOUT
[0:29:55] <SchroedingersFerret> It's full of sugar
[0:29:59] <EASrake> I like the other v8 looming in the background
[0:30:00] <%Ninestempest> That shit is NOT "good" fo ryou, it just isn't as shit as a soda
[0:30:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat 8 YEARS
[0:30:01] <miguelrod777> BEEN WATCHING SINCE MIDDLE SCHOOL
[0:30:01] <%Dingus_Tickler> LUL Emulating Pat from 14-22? Congratulations, you’re actually 29 now
[0:30:01] <glacialbluebird> #Sponsored
[0:30:02] <%InsomniacPersona> I feel like he poursm out the V8 and pours in Red Bull to get away with it
[0:30:02] <AbnormalEnd> @AngriestPat better watch that sodium intake tho
[0:30:03] <deviljhojho94> delicious delicious gout
[0:30:03] <SaltyAzteca> SHAMELESS MARKETING!
[0:30:04] <goddamndavid> A V8 isnt necessarily GOOD for you but it's a lot less shitty than a soda
[0:30:04] <PettyFunk> I threw up when I drank V8 as a child so I've never touched it since
[0:30:06] <Inebriateddonut> Use that V8 sponsorship on money
[0:30:09] <Dairaipie> IVE BEEN WATCHING SINCE 07
[0:30:09] <Enthaarungscreme> Finding Nemo is 15 years old!
[0:30:13] <miguelrod777> AM 19 NOW
[0:30:13] <Cobaltor_252> @NWR_James business as usual then
[0:30:16] <CertainlySyrix> @Rivalshotzgp Ivara took me over ten hours of straight grinding in order to get all her parts.
[0:30:18] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I bet it has aspartame or sucralose in it
[0:30:23] <%ssaryn> Also... #FE....? WHO EVEN SAW THAT COMING.
[0:30:25] <PettyFunk> And yeah V8 isn't very healthy but it sure as fuck isn't Red Bull so....?
[0:30:26] <pennykettle_> @ThatKoben triS
[0:30:27] <Zael913> !uptime
[0:30:28] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 30m 36s.
[0:30:34] <pennykettle_> @ThatKoben triTip welcome
[0:30:37] <arcadeHemorrhage > Pat is so much like the Corpus.
[0:30:40] <reonome> KOWASHITAI
[0:30:44] <+ssjklyco> I hear Matt and Woolie love persona/smt more than Pat.
[0:30:47] <Rivalshotzgp> @certainlysyrix 10 hours is less than a weekend of grinding
[0:30:48] <%ssaryn> #FE was the Persona game we never asked for, but the one we always wanted.
[0:30:50] <%SickBangerzM9> Fighting deadly monsters?
[0:30:59] <+ccwettr123> Trying to decide whether to pick up FF15 for pc or pre-order Battle for Azeroth
[0:30:59] <%Dingus_Tickler> I’m going to be honest. I’m skipping that FE LP. But I absolutely love the shit out of KOTOR LP. Pat or Riot
[0:30:59] <%i_am_therydon> god damn pat i went and took a shower and you still haven't started playing?
[0:30:59] <Golden_Battler> @AngriestPat is it cuz the jump height is weird relative to the ledges? cuz that was my complaint
[0:31:01] <%psychodave1234> man im gonna punch the twitch app for not telling me you were online
[0:31:04] <GurrenPrime> one of my favorites
[0:31:07] <%breakfastmegapowers> When Pacific Rim 3 is a Giant Robot crime drama in a giant robot Metropolis, I'll be back then
[0:31:14] <PerfectlyGenericUsername> PeoplesChamp
[0:31:19] <pennykettle_> Im really curious to see how far Pat is in the system because he seems farther ahead than me but he hasnt done the quests
[0:31:22] <Everpresent_Overseer> @AngriestPat Right now you have the most viewers of warframe streamers
[0:31:24] <CertainlySyrix> @Rivalshotzgp point being if I knew what I was in for and had the option of buying her I would've rather bought her than go through that
[0:31:24] <arcadeHemorrhage > i only have 473 :(

[0:32:14] <$Bncbck> @Karhax I've got 3000 of both warframe and dota and i 100% regret the Dota
[0:32:14] <Spydurman> I can hear him getting high off the idea
[0:32:15] <+sgt_booyah> oh pat, you have no idea, you are now stuck here like the rest of us
[0:32:15] <GurrenPrime> i think i broke 100 yesterday
[0:32:18] <@thenefftw> This game is a lootbox
[0:32:20] <CertainlySyrix> @Rivalshotzgp I stick to the ones with the highest drop rates that were easiest.
[0:32:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I have paid 20 bucks in my 2400 hours
[0:32:24] <%ssaryn> apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo
[0:32:28] <mercado94> im currently installing warframe
[0:32:28] <+migofrompluto> There are no servers, I believe its mostly pier to pier
[0:32:30] <arcadeHemorrhage > SNORE
[0:32:34] <%DedlokPM> In fact there wa a time they had a lot box esque thing and then they removed it when they saw someone buy it 200 times
[0:32:35] <Graywolf_the_45th> I'm such a loser, i'm only at 100 hors
[0:32:35] <frozenottsel> mew
[0:32:37] <GurrenPrime> i think i paid ten when paris came out
[0:32:37] <%breakfastmegapowers> @PettyFunk @GurrenPrime Nah, it'll be like that My Life as A Teenage Robot series finale with the Robo World except Jaegars
[0:32:42] <AirlineFood74> F
[0:32:47] <%ssaryn> Be ready to have your asshole ripped open by Orphan of Kos.
[0:32:47] <%i_am_therydon> you will never hear the music
[0:32:50] <AirlineFood74> Good luck homie
[0:32:55] <arcadeHemorrhage > Hes a hard fight
[0:32:56] <ArgentUndaCova> BlessRNG BlessRNG BlessRNG BlessRNG
[0:32:59] <GurrenPrime> my life as a teenage robot was so good
[0:33:00] <CertainlySyrix> Has Pat started playing or is he just going through donations before beginning right now?
[0:33:02] <%SickBangerzM9> Whats the name of that stupid monster with the hair physics that fucks up your camera in bb?
[0:33:03] <%ssaryn> DAMN IT
[0:33:06] <Rivalshotzgp> @certainlysyrix that probably explains it, if I remember right some harder ones with lower drops were WAY better for the actual farming
[0:33:07] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> FUCK
[0:33:10] <AirlineFood74> @GurrenPrime FUCK YEAH IT IS
[0:33:14] <mr_gentleman96> @AngriestPat I had a way harder time with ludlith the big dog thing in the dlc as opposed to the orphan dunno why
[0:33:15] <MithraMot> amelia with the hair
[0:33:19] <deviljhojho94> Vicar amelia
[0:33:20] <%ssaryn> No you wouldn't.
[0:33:22] <%TaifuDragon> YEAH ME TOO
[0:33:26] <jagchan> I actually thought Ludwig was harder
[0:33:30] <@thenefftw> You would keep that shit
[0:33:31] <%Ninestempest> THey aren't for "one weapon," they're for one weapon TYPE
[0:33:32] <LeafarOznolam> Did pat encounter stalker?
[0:33:37] <%YabbaTroll> yo harrow is shit to farm tho
[0:33:38] <+migofrompluto> Harrow?
[0:33:40] <CertainlySyrix> @Rivalshotzgp If they had lower drop rates and they were more difficult it would've been more difficult.
[0:33:40] <deviljhojho94> Vicar amelia twerks you to dead with her hairy ass its fucking horrifying and retarded
[0:33:42] <Worldbrand> Harrow's quite a farm, but I'd sell 'im
[0:33:42] <%breakfastmegapowers> My Life as A Teenage Robot was DA BESS
[0:33:44] <fissileshelf89> hes not rare
[0:33:44] <Gorgen> without doing the quest?
[0:33:45] <GreatSmasherPunch> it's a bad farm
[0:33:47] <+migofrompluto> Yeah he's a pain in the arse
[0:33:48] <+dickbuttwoman> Holy fuck is Harrow abitch to farm tho
[0:33:49] <%AurumReaps> pats a coward
[0:33:51] <Alzack13> How different is Warframe from about a year ago? I got a little bored from the vague grind after 80 hours
[0:33:52] <mrdazg> Id do VicarAmelia if she wasnt so angery
[0:33:54] <+AntithesisEK> rivens are diamonds; the prices are violently inflated by the company who sells them and you don't actually need them to survive
[0:33:55] <%SickBangerzM9> Pat is not a team player got it
[0:33:55] <%ssaryn> Gifting frames, I will admit, defeats a lot of that purpose. If you wanna BUY THEM, fine. Some farms for Frames is fucking awful.
[0:33:56] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Somone gave you another frame?
[0:33:56] <%AurumReaps> everyone gift him everything
[0:33:58] <STRIKER50450> I found ludwig rather easy as opposed to orphan
[0:33:58] <%LGWPhanto> He has one part that's absolutely the worst thing to farm ever.
[0:34:00] <%xemnahort> @breakfastmegapowers dude you know it
[0:34:01] <AirlineFood74> It's an awful farm, be greatefull tho
[0:34:02] <jagchan> Vicar Emelia is my wife and I love her
[0:34:02] <+MetroidHunter26> @AngriestPat yeah sell the rivens you don't want for weapons you don't really like and keep the ones you like. Is a good way to make plat off other players
[0:34:03] <%NWR_James> I thought someone asked Pat if he tried a hardcore drug. And I was right. Warframe
[0:34:05] <STRIKER50450> took me 1 try for ludwig
[0:34:05] <+migofrompluto> Harrow is HEADSHOTMASTER!
[0:34:07] <GurrenPrime> wait which frame?
[0:34:08] <AirlineFood74> dnont mean to be a dick
[0:34:10] <STRIKER50450> 6 for orphan
[0:34:10] <SunsetJack> Harrow is great...
[0:34:10] <%Stinzik> Graxx Harrow life
[0:34:11] <GurrenPrime> oh
[0:34:12] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat he's not rare, but hes a bitch to farm
[0:34:13] <AirlineFood74> @GurrenPrime harrow
[0:34:15] <CertainlySyrix> Harrow is my favorite Frame in the game.
[0:34:15] <fissileshelf89> the spy farming takes along time though
[0:34:15] <pennykettle_> Can someone tell me if Im supposed to collect all the weapons? Im running out of slots continusously, should I sell bad weapons or buy slots every time
[0:34:16] <+Nthenorm> harrow graxx skin tho
[0:34:16] <+Bloodxb> his other head is great
[0:34:17] <arcadeHemorrhage > GRAXX
[0:34:17] <Rogue657> @AngriestPat Harrow is build-specific, if you build him for his 4 and give your team invulnerability he's strong.
[0:34:18] <%LGWPhanto> His second helmet is super cool
[0:34:18] <%ssaryn> Also Harrow's Graxx skin is FUCKING GREAT.
[0:34:18] <+MarshallLee67> @AngriestPat you can get alternate helmets for frames from alerts
[0:34:18] <%breakfastmegapowers> @xemnahort Dude I know it
[0:34:20] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat HIS GRAXX SKIN
[0:34:21] <Zombrocom> Harrow has a great alt helmet
[0:34:22] <Rivalshotzgp> @certainlysyrix time to beat vs perceived difficulty
[0:34:22] <+dickbuttwoman> Feel happy, you NEVER have to touch a Defection mission, Pat
[0:34:24] <+skibbz_> Harrow fucking owns.
[0:34:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> LOOK AT THE OBERON SKINS
[0:34:25] <%commanderclaw> !uptime
[0:34:26] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 34m 34s.
[0:34:26] <%LGWPhanto> And Harrow's Graxx skin is fucking amazing
[0:34:26] <+Brewstamasta> Looks like a power ranger villain...I love him
[0:34:27] <RossMirage> How long has he been streaming?
[0:34:31] <Jodoxk1> Pat youve never been more wrong
[0:34:39] <sassyquatch963> wrong about everything
[0:34:42] <AirlineFood74> @pennykettle_ sell the bads @RossMirage 34 mins~

[0:34:47] <AirlineFood74> 34~ mins*
[0:34:48] <GurrenPrime> @fruit_pie_the_magician feyarch is that amazing skin right?
[0:34:50] <%Solidnick18> yeah well
[0:34:50] <+duskerz> he said frame of war you dumb
[0:34:51] <%breakfastmegapowers> How are you gonna hang your frame of War on the wall?

[0:34:54] <%DedlokPM> Yes I did, pat. Yes I did. teenJOY
[0:34:55] <%SickBangerzM9> What reason did they give for Kratos surviving GOW3?
[0:34:56] <AirlineFood74> OHHHH NYEA HERE WE GO
[0:34:56] <Paragon_Sheep> Is pat actually pkaying yet
[0:34:57] <%psychodave1234> okay look. kratos is a trash man, but he's MY trash man
[0:34:59] <$GohanEgret> kratos did nothing wrong Kappa
[0:34:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> not as stupid as u
[0:35:01] <fruit_pie_the_magician> fuck yeah it is
[0:35:05] <SuperCreeperBlocks> I went back to Warframe this week and I still don’t know what the Fuck to do
[0:35:07] <+MikoNoPants> You shouldnt really worry about Harrow for awhile unless you buy him
[0:35:08] <+migofrompluto> Nobody show Pat the tennogen skins and helmets :P
[0:35:08] <Rivalshotzgp> If you can beat two harder 2% spies in the time to do a 3% spy that’s what to do (and I did)
[0:35:14] <%Stinzik> Don't buy GPS right now!
[0:35:16] <bitjama> If you get plat for free you can't trade it seems
[0:35:21] <%Stinzik> GPUs*
[0:35:22] <%Ninestempest> If you are shopping for a rig, GOOD LUCK LOOKIGN FOR GPUs
[0:35:24] <%SolitaryDrake> Who did less wrong, Kratos or Griffith?
[0:35:25] <Shinmaddrox> oof, New rig in this Crypto-currency climate.
[0:35:25] <thelonechris> Remember when Kratos turned off the sun because reasons?
[0:35:27] <+gollum80> all gpus are horribly overpirced right now
[0:35:28] <ArgentUndaCova> Remember when Kratos killed a dude stuck on a chair by setting him on fire?
[0:35:28] <StynCity> every gpu is overpriced right now
[0:35:29] <GurrenPrime> @fruit_pie_the_magician i wish i had the stuff for that because that would make me play oberon again
[0:35:33] <faegbeard> May have gone too far in a few places.
[0:35:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> it might be the best skin in the game.
[0:35:39] <Caivyre> do NOT buy GPUs now
[0:35:39] <Paragon_Sheep> I just got Nidus yesterday, didn't play him but spent some time making him look cool!
[0:35:43] <%Aggro_Will> That's a pretty dope computer. Wasn't hinking of going THAT nuts. Considering the Helios 300 even before Matt and Woolie shilled for it on the podcast.
[0:35:46] <%ssaryn> I feel really dumb for buying my 1080TI at such a high price... but man... THAT NUMBER. apatBig apatBig apatBig
[0:35:49] <Forente> what withi the bitcoin
[0:35:50] <%breakfastmegapowers> I've seen 0 gameplay of Warframe so I HOPE its a Soccer Sim
[0:35:51] <GurrenPrime> it's so fucking cool i wish nova had better skins
[0:35:52] <Daxalog> The high end Tinas have been cut down in price.
[0:35:52] <fruit_pie_the_magician> except maybe that one mag skin

[0:49:45] <+big_man_stomp> if i were anything main, it would be nidus
[0:49:45] <Spydurman> no
[0:49:52] <StarSkullyman> So slow
[0:49:53] <+boredpantz> Limbo is the no fun frame
[0:49:56] <arcadeHemorrhage > no
[0:49:58] <%Sendrak70> So, what the consensus. Is Warframe just a better version of Destiny?
[0:49:58] <drakthebest> 49 minutes in, we started the first mission 5 minutes ago
[0:49:58] <%breakfastmegapowers> The curse virus has spread
[0:50:00] <Rogue657> @TsunamiPoro I'd give him a little more before he tries relic systems. he still has a lot of quests to go through
[0:50:03] <+Ultimatefool> @AngriestPat Any warframes you want to build next?
[0:50:06] <+MikoNoPants> Frost is great too,
[0:50:06] <+ThePayphone> i played 2000 hours of this game since launch but uninstalled it over a year ago
[0:50:06] <Sunstalker> Is Trininity in this game still an immortal 3 button masher that carries entire teams from any point on the map?
[0:50:07] <%Dingus_Tickler> @rogue657 I played this game for 80 hours over a year ago. I dropped the game when they overhauled the Planet System. When I came back a month ago, they nerfed Tonkor superhard with the self-damage
[0:50:11] <Dapper_Cactuar> Limbo is the "No Fun Allowed" frame
[0:50:14] <fjarcob> Limbo is the most funn frame if you're playing solo
[0:50:20] <RossMirage> Has Woolie made up his mind to try Warframe as well?
[0:50:21] <%Stinzik> If you're gonna play Limbo, for the love of god do not play stasis unless you're soloing
[0:50:26] <cherrycottontail> stop running aorund like an idiot ang guard a point
[0:50:26] <%Mawarup> so how do i go about joining the clan?
[0:50:31] <+FadingEmber> It would seem Pat has been focusing more on loot and less on the getting good Kappa
[0:50:31] <+pantsureaper> ^
[0:50:33] <CertainlySyrix> @RossMirage They plan to do a video for the channel together.
[0:50:36] <Rogue657> @Dingus_Tickler you'll be happy to hear that energy vamp build is still godlike
[0:50:39] <Zael913> I remember last I played I got Necro, is he any good?
[0:50:41] <WoRabbit> so should I play this with a controller or mouse and keyboard if I'm on pc?
[0:50:42] <$serpenttucker> @AngriestPat Protip: your affnity splits between all of your gear, regardless of if it is maxed out. Bringing less weapons on missions concentrates the affinity you get for them, making it easier to rank up specific shit.
[0:50:44] <%IllusionKiller522> man pat is bad at this game
[0:50:47] <%breakfastmegapowers> Why play Limbo if you can play Inside?
[0:50:49] <+big_man_stomp> how has pats shooting been?
[0:50:49] <@PlagueOfGripes> does he even need affinity
[0:50:49] <Rogue657> @Zael913 Yes, still good for getting item drops
[0:50:49] <BaronVonWolfe> Oh Pat, you're definitely gonna join me in the Fuck Ember club.
[0:50:50] <drakthebest> If you have a nova she can totally get to them first
[0:50:52] <StarSkullyman> Snailframe
[0:50:54] <bwong1231> if you get to close to the door they change spawn points
[0:50:55] <Zael913> Cool
[0:50:55] <TheInkshow> @AngriestPat Can I joing your clan?
[0:50:56] <Inebriateddonut> Oh noes Pat is turning into a hallway hero D:
[0:50:58] <+big_man_stomp> with the controller
[0:50:58] <DragonOfWarZro> farm for for vaubaun Kappa
[0:51:00] <Worldbrand> they try not to spawn within LoS
[0:51:00] <+MikoNoPants> Trinity still heals well but she cant heal across a map like oberon can
[0:51:02] <$Mornaka> Clap
[0:51:04] <+Hinasil> I main Mesa because she's hot
[0:51:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> amazing
[0:51:06] <Rogue657> @BaronVonWolfe not really an issue anymore now that her 4 is worthless
[0:51:07] <TaurusOxford> Pat the Cheater. :P
[0:51:10] <Bouldus> well done Pat
[0:51:13] <Twoiis> He made a big stomp.
[0:51:15] <Jodoxk1> whenever I play limbo its usually on excav put bubble on drill stop time GG
[0:51:15] <Ryham_Assassin> @serpenttucker I didn't know that, thank you
[0:51:16] <CertainlySyrix> @WoRabbit mouse and keyboard's better but you can play with whatever you're comfortable with. perfectly playable with a controller
[0:51:20] <Bouldus> im very proud
[0:51:22] <+ThePayphone> @Zael913 his desecrate ability is okay for farming for items but not even the best at that, not very good attack wise either
[0:51:26] <%prisefighter1188> my favorite so far is saryn
[0:51:28] <Superstrata> PogChamp he did it
[0:51:31] <%breakfastmegapowers> Whys pat not using Witch Time
[0:51:37] <+NickyDynamite> Presidio mesa is the nicest looking frame imo
[0:51:38] <Zael913> Oh, shame
[0:51:39] <%Dingus_Tickler> @rogue657 I just miss playing my Trinity Prime and running Link 24/7 with constant EV and occasional Blessing for that sweet 90% Damage Reduction
[0:51:43] <+creamandsugar> remember @AngriestPat your stomp is not a wave, its a cylinder. It hits everything above and below you as well if it's within the meter range around you
[0:51:45] <+MikoNoPants> Trins heals are stronger and she can generate energy
[0:51:46] <drakthebest> It's annoying as fuck now but when the missions get hard you'll be super grateful for it
[0:51:49] <WoRabbit> @CertainlySyrix thanks for the input
[0:51:50] <%OdysseyKnight> Wasn't THAT long ago
[0:51:51] <+TsunamiPoro> literally 2 months ago
[0:51:55] <Dapper_Cactuar> just take the ignis with combustion beam on into low level areas and kill everything with one pull of the trigger
[0:51:57] <DrHeySeuss> I'm a filthy Trinity user nepOh

[0:52:42] <+KaldorDraig0> Children make the best opponents. They're always easy to crush
[0:52:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> the sonicor and the atomos are some of the best secondaries
[0:52:42] <%Dingus_Tickler> @rogue657 I have a ton of Prime Warframes on my account. But Trinity before the nerfs was my favorite
[0:52:44] <edited156> SPORES
[0:52:44] <RichAnvils> so Clemps was playing Clemps?
[0:52:46] <$serpenttucker> SPORES?1

[0:52:53] <%Daigrey> Elmo plays Nidus!
[0:52:54] <Forente> LUL
[0:52:57] <Jodoxk1> Elmo cat mushroom confirmed
[0:52:58] <+Saltima> @AngriestPat there are augment mods you can put on your warframe that can add different uses for a certain skill. these are mainly acquired through a syndicate.
[0:52:58] <%GarbageNirvana> Elmo is a fungus, new lore
[0:53:01] <+KaldorDraig0> Elmo is a fungus confirmed
[0:53:15] <+MikoNoPants> Suicide trin builds arent sortie worthy though
[0:53:15] <%breakfastmegapowers> What like being Gohan?
[0:53:18] <Zael913> So, the frames I have are Ash, Volt, Ember, Excalibur and Necro. Which ones are still decent? I assume Excalibur is still good cuz obviously reasons
[0:53:21] <%YabbaTroll> dont do the pvp
[0:53:21] <+MarshallLee67> pvp is awful
[0:53:24] <+ThePayphone> @PlagueOfGripes i uninstalled warframe long ago and dont play it anymore but have 2000 hours, i might be able to re-install and give you some of my old items
[0:53:24] <BaronVonWolfe> Yep
[0:53:26] <Rogue657> @MikoNoPants they don't work anymore period
[0:53:30] <mcevers> conclave is so terrible
[0:53:33] <%prisefighter1188> apatPorgmo spread the plasmosis
[0:53:33] <mcevers> lunaro is fun though
[0:53:35] <deviljhojho94> Devil never cry
[0:53:37] <Worldbrand> the PVP has a skill ceiling so high it doesn't fit in the draw distance
[0:53:38] <xalrv> @angriestpat man you won’t believe the shit mirage could do Kappa Kappa Kappa bitch breaks PCs
[0:53:41] <%Stinzik> Just wait until you get "The Hammer"

[0:54:21] <AirlineFood74> 69 nice Kappa
[0:54:23] <+ragnarokaftershock> Building valkyr a certain way really does turn the game into dynasty warriors
[0:54:28] <$serpenttucker> @AngriestPat Pat affinity splits between your gear, regardless of if it is maxed out or not. If you bring less weapons, it concentrates the affinity.
[0:54:29] <ragasquid> fighting games are only fun to get into if you enjoy failing
[0:54:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @angriestpat LOOK AT THE FEYARCH SKIN

[1:01:43] <+magikestral> @angriestpat unlocking planets are easy, just do your nodes and you'll be on yout way
[1:01:44] <%Dingus_Tickler> I remember doing Stealth Missions and telling MR1s to stay the fuck still and don’t leave the starting room LUL Then run into all 3 rooms and finish the hacks on all of them
[1:01:44] <sunriser696> you can buy rhino prime parts
[1:01:46] <Worldbrand> to move good, only ever touch the ground while you're sliding, and always chain your double jumps into rolls
[1:01:49] <sunriser696> from other players
[1:01:49] <+ThePayphone> aka "i was the only rhino"
[1:01:49] <CertainlySyrix> You can get Rhino Prime by trading still @MajorMarshtomp

[1:02:56] <CertainlySyrix> @electrokev007 They look fancier and have slightly better stats and different starting polarities.

[1:03:15] <Spydurman> it's basically free real estate for a self-sustaining economy
[1:03:17] <%Ele_On_A_Uni> yall don't know how warframe works, pat's describing a pretty basic transaction :V

[1:04:03] <CertainlySyrix> Month behind on updates and no tennogen but otherwise fine @Tokanova
[1:04:04] <+ThePayphone> I might re install warframe if either pat or plague want some arcane helms and other shit i have sitting in my inv
[1:04:05] <@PlagueOfGripes> actually you're probably way off syndicate
[1:04:09] <0078thunder> big roar makes big inspire for team
[1:04:14] <Worldbrand> rhino's buff is great because it's, like, the only multiplicative buff in the game
[1:04:15] <+Tokanova> i have no idea what a tennogen is so
[1:04:16] <+Tokanova> cool
[1:04:18] <%Vanishingtrooper> Rhino has been my favorite for a long time now

[1:04:24] <Zael913> Is frost still the best tank frame?
[1:04:24] <%Dingus_Tickler> PC is obvs the best because of M+KB, but PS4 is good too

[1:04:40] <Derkinstacker> You should get a Mesa frame Pat, then you don't have to aim.
[1:04:50] <Sulliman34> mesa is super fun
[1:04:52] <blackorchidKI2> @Tokanova Community made content that sometimes looks better than the DE made stuff Kappa
[1:04:53] <+AntithesisEK> on PC tennogen is purchased through steam, on consoles it uses platinum
[1:04:57] <%Stinzik> High Noon Frame
[1:04:59] <+AntithesisEK> certain items are not on consoles
[1:05:00] <bitjama> mesa is hard to farm
[1:05:03] <%breakfastmegapowers> HACK-ING!
[1:05:04] <Sulliman34> oh pat you should get Limbo, hes dio
[1:05:04] <Derkinstacker> Mesa is my favorite.
[1:05:06] <+ruddyredbone> mesa is boring
[1:05:09] <+Tokanova> i'm sure it'll catch up with updates eventually. shame about the tennogen though
[1:05:13] <Worldbrand> yeah I imagine mesa is a pain to get now that she's not new
[1:05:19] <Navlock> Mmmmh, Valkyr is bae
[1:05:20] <+MikoNoPants> @tokanova Tennogen are user made cosmetics
[1:05:21] <Worldbrand> keyshares when she was released made things not so bad
[1:05:25] <TheNeedlesD> @PlagueOfGripes Why is Gara so time consuming to farm?
[1:05:28] <Cobalt_Racer> HAHAHA
[1:05:29] <%Dingus_Tickler> I wish Warframe hosted a PS4 to PC Profile Transfer. If that was the case, I would jump back on Warframe super hard
[1:05:29] <IminyourBase> he doesn't know about limbo
[1:05:30] <%prisefighter1188> he could always get ember and throw ultimate and just aim around with your cursor
[1:05:30] <@thenefftw> Pat, get Limbo
[1:05:32] <Sulliman34> nah Limbo is straight up fancy dio.
[1:05:32] <%Ele_On_A_Uni> limbo is the world
[1:05:33] <IminyourBase> HE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT LIMBO
[1:05:34] <Cobalt_Racer> limbo is the real dio
[1:05:35] <OceanGovernor> WRRRRRRY
[1:05:37] <reaperx186> wait until limbo gran
[1:05:38] <PhantaniumOG> oh dude wait til you see limbo
[1:05:40] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> PAT LIMBO IS LITERALLY DIO
[1:05:41] <Daniel910203> cheer200 Hey Pat, thanks for all the entertainment of this stream and of last week's podcast. Playing the God of War 3 again thanks to you guys. Boy, talk about a game where the camera and story establishes you as a villain and plays off how terrifying it is. Its kinda amazing really and I cant really think of another example without humor. Can you?
[1:05:41] <@thenefftw> @AngriestPat LIMBO
[1:05:42] <+d00msdaydan> @AngriestPat speaking of jojo references, have you seen limbo's agile animation set?
[1:05:44] <BaronVonWolfe> Charge becomes an integral part of the best Rhino build later on.
[1:05:44] <%breakfastmegapowers> Maybe Valve will open a new studio like Valve 2 and Valve 2 part 2
[1:05:46] <AirlineFood74> LIMBO IS DIO
[1:05:46] <MrNoobMcSalt> no but limbo though
[1:05:47] <KwakuAnansi> Oh we're getting into JoJo now are we
[1:05:47] <Croetec> oh god limbo, the cause and solution to all of the games problems
[1:05:48] <CertainlySyrix> @AngriestPat That's Limbo, not Rhino. Limbo is Za Warudo
[1:05:48] <%legendfather_of_giants> LIMBO PAT
[1:05:50] <Inebriateddonut> Limbo is the WRRRRYL Dio frame
[1:05:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[1:05:51] <+AntithesisEK> you're greatly overestimating DE barring stealing from EVA and Guyver
[1:05:55] <Peashooter117> Limbo is DIO Pat soon you shall learn
[1:05:56] <faegbeard> IT SAYS HERE THAT YOU'RE SLOW
[1:05:57] <%LGWPhanto> Limbo Agile Stance, Top Tier Animations
[1:05:59] <AtlasMcCoy> I dont think pat has the planets unlocked to get limbo
[1:06:01] <IminyourBase> limbo literally has za warudo
[1:06:03] <Dapper_Cactuar> the description on rhino's stomp reads "He stomps with so much force it warps reality"
[1:06:04] <+LethalSquatch> The Wolrld is Limbo lols
[1:06:07] <The_Handsome_shark> @AngriestPat status on ur firearm license? you said you were getting it a couple months back
[1:06:07] <+ChocalateDog203> for the love of god dont let pat use limbo
[1:06:08] <%Stinzik> No, god, no Limbo. At least no Stasis Limbo
[1:06:09] <Derkinstacker> Has pat gotten an archframe yet?
[1:06:10] <$Pacohax> Can’t wait for my valkyr and mirage tonight
[1:06:10] <reaperx186> aka i have created my field of frozen time where these throwing knives are stuck in air infront of your frozen body
[1:06:13] <%deadpalvgz> Limbo is realllly good
[1:06:15] <+ajcritfumble> dio limbo is one of the best cosplays in the game next to saryn Red and Gram transistor lol
[1:06:16] <deviljhojho94> Dio is limbo
[1:06:18] <+MajorMarshtomp> How do you like your weapon loadout Pat?
[1:06:19] <%boratebuffer> @AngriestPat Hey Pat can I get a clan invite
[1:06:20] <Sulliman34> what??? limbo is fantastic
[1:06:20] <%YabbaTroll> limbo is a memeframe
[1:06:20] <+HRDSalami654> Nope. DE didn't even know about JoJo when he was created.
[1:06:24] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Limbo is super good
[1:06:25] <fjarcob> Limbo is amazing though
[1:06:25] <%Ele_On_A_Uni> he's like dio but not fun
[1:06:25] <@thenefftw> You need to get Libo
[1:06:25] <%breakfastmegapowers> Limbo is vampire
[1:06:27] <%InkblotBlues> Limbo is fine, it is the children who are wrong.
[1:06:27] <+TerryTheTurret> Limbo is great solo...can be a bit of a pain to play with tho
[1:06:29] <+crdy93> He got reworked, he's cool now.
[1:06:29] <+HelloImTom08> limbo is really annoying if he's on your team
[1:06:29] <CertainlySyrix> I've heard very unflattering things about Dio. LUL
[1:06:31] <AtlasMcCoy> Everyone hates limbo. This is the only reason I like playing him.
[1:06:31] <+babyacid> Thats because Limbo is Dip
[1:06:32] <Caivyre> I started playing thanks to Pat, and I just did the second dream, and MAN WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS VIDEOGAME
[1:06:32] <@PlagueOfGripes> Limbo's idea is fine. the developers just implemented his kit in a profoundly stupid way.
[1:06:32] <sassyquatch963> limbo can be aweful to play with is all, unlesss your mesa
[1:06:34] <+AntithesisEK> limbo is fine the people who main him are insane asylum escapees
[1:06:35] <Worldbrand> Limbo's great if you're playing as him, and terrible if you're playing with him
[1:06:36] <+ruddyredbone> do you like not being able to hurt enemies
[1:06:37] <GoldeNOVA> Limbo is good in very specific cases
[1:06:37] <+babyacid> Dio*
[1:06:38] <Stol3nheart> LImbo used to be bad, but now hes really strong
[1:06:38] <%breakfastmegapowers> Vampire is Limbo
[1:06:42] <+MikoNoPants> Gara is a somewhat crappier frost atm, also Mirage and Valkyr are fun
[1:06:42] <+Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat Limbo is the Longsword of Warframe
[1:06:43] <+SwdVengeance> Limbo is great, he just takes a knowledge of the frame to use. He's super easy to troll your own team with, on purpose or not.
[1:06:44] <+Hinasil> Limbo is for anyone that's not a giant baby child
[1:06:49] <grayjammer> Itsalmost like Time Stop Powers exited before Jojo......
[1:06:50] <CertainlySyrix> Limbo's not that annoying anymore.
[1:06:52] <Gabintzky> limbo is a good frame, but he's one of the few frames that can actively fuck over your entire team if played poorly
[1:06:56] <HypeArbalest> Oh you are so wrong
[1:06:57] <+ZalgoTheWickedGod> People who hate Limbo can suck it.
[1:06:57] <Navlock> Helios OP, plz Nerf ;)
[1:06:58] <Mrbaconator> yup fuck scanning
[1:06:58] <Sulliman34> limbo is amazing if you have his 4 aug
[1:06:59] <Rogue657> he's still extremely annoying lmfao
[1:06:59] <cool_chuliann> Limbo literally looks like arsene
[1:06:59] <fjarcob> Oh god Pat did you watch a fucking ancient Limbo pre-rework video?
[1:07:00] <Gorgen> Cant you build fieldrons
[1:07:00] <%breakfastmegapowers> Cause raisins
[1:07:04] <AnacondaVirtue> Burn the ship
[1:07:04] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> yes
[1:07:05] <+skibbz_> don't worry about it
[1:07:06] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @angriestpat you still need to buy scans
[1:07:07] <KwakuAnansi> yes
[1:07:09] <bitjama> aim pat
[1:07:09] <TheInkshow> I like scaning
[1:07:09] <sassyquatch963> gotta keep infestation from spreading
[1:07:10] <TheImmortal70> Blow the infested up, and take a ship with it
[1:07:10] <CertainlySyrix> It's a derelict ship now
[1:07:10] <@PlagueOfGripes> too bad you'll then be buying shit tons of scanners
[1:07:12] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> Anyone know if a certain email pen pal has spawned on Pat yet?
[1:07:12] <%big_man_stomp> you have to kill these bioweapons
[1:07:13] <Stol3nheart> Yeah, you blow it up
[1:07:14] <Volkrotia> But Metroid Prime though
[1:07:14] <EASrake> Yes, but don't think about it
[1:07:14] <Sulliman34> limbo with the 4 aug makes defense of any kind a sinch
[1:07:15] <Shinmaddrox> Too fuckin bad, pat. You will have to manually scan on uranus.
[1:07:15] <+TsunamiPoro> oh scanning aint goin away anytime soon
[1:07:18] <Worldbrand> that's nezha
[1:07:20] <KwakuAnansi> Oh Nezha
[1:07:22] <%Ele_On_A_Uni> nezha AKA best boy
[1:07:25] <+HRDSalami654> Limbo is great if you play him smart. So Pat is SOL.
[1:07:25] <TheImmortal70> @Plagueofgripes how do you get more of those without cash?
[1:07:29] <%big_man_stomp> RIVEN MODS
[1:07:30] <Gorgen> Skater boi.
[1:07:31] <%Stinzik> If you do a Stasis build, you basically just caused your team to not be able to use guns
[1:07:32] <CertainlySyrix> @PlagueOfGripes You can use Synthesis scanners with the infinite module in place of them, Helios can use those.
[1:07:33] <+Fenrirlives> Nezha speedy boi!
[1:07:33] <+MikoNoPants> is there a Nezha there?
[1:07:34] <%Dingus_Tickler> Nezha
[1:07:35] <+ZalgoTheWickedGod> Nezha is best boy.
[1:07:37] <+dickbuttwoman> TRAP BOI
[1:07:37] <@PlagueOfGripes> you get a widget that makes them infinite and free
[1:07:38] <%big_man_stomp> R I V E N M O D S
[1:07:39] <IminyourBase> Nezha
[1:07:39] <%YabbaTroll> loli frame
[1:07:40] <Divryne> That's a Nezha.
[1:07:42] <+gutlesscoward> it's mah boi nezha!
[1:07:42] <booterdagg> Ne Zha frame
[1:07:44] <+ruddyredbone> has pat met AM at the relay?
[1:07:46] <%breakfastmegapowers> Its a floating Skip-It
[1:07:47] <Gorgen> Trap frame
[1:07:49] <Sulliman34> i HATE thats the pronunciation
[1:07:50] <MonsieurHedge> its pronounced nay-ja
[1:07:50] <Croetec> Nezha best girl (male)
[1:07:50] <Worldbrand> You know Iron Skin? It's practically identical to Iron Skin.
[1:07:52] <+AntithesisEK> It's Iron Skin you can put on people with an augment @AngriestPat
[1:07:54] <+creamandsugar> @angriestpat Yea Nezha gives you an extra iron skin basically
[1:07:56] <Divryne> Defense buff Pat.
[1:07:56] <%Dingus_Tickler> Isn’t Nezha male?
[1:07:57] <%AurumReaps> pat thats not a hula hoop
[1:07:58] <Stol3nheart> Its like a weaker shared ironskinpat
[1:07:59] <Dapper_Cactuar> It shields you and burns enemies that get too close
[1:08:00] <WizoSavage> It’s best to never stop farming those Fieldron/MutagenMass/DeroniteInjector for future blueprints
[1:08:02] <Divryne> Nezha is super male.
[1:08:03] <TheImmortal70> Nezha is a trap
[1:08:04] <%AurumReaps> thats a rotating circle
[1:08:04] <booterdagg> Ne Zha (knee-zhaw)
[1:08:05] <%big_man_stomp> nezha hoop is speed right?
[1:08:06] <CertainlySyrix> Nezha is a dude that looks like a lady
[1:08:07] <+HRDSalami654> It protects you Pat.
[1:08:08] <%ssaryn> @Dingus_Tickler Ne Zha is indeed a big trap.
[1:08:08] <jagchan> Hole Hordro
[1:08:08] <+TsunamiPoro> wow that is certainly a pronunciation
[1:08:12] <+boredpantz> i didnt realize Nezha was a boy until now
[1:08:12] <PowerArmorMeow> Warding Halo @AngriestPat damage resist
[1:08:14] <%Ele_On_A_Uni> your hula hoop
[1:08:14] <Divryne> Go look it up in Chinese mythology. ;)
[1:08:15] <+AntithesisEK> ne sha / jha
[1:08:15] <+Octumn> Protection
[1:08:18] <%Ele_On_A_Uni> it's like a mini iron skin
[1:08:18] <Zael913> Burn the heretic, kill the mutant, purge the unclean.
[1:08:19] <ShazBo2000> If only makes you bigger and stronger
[1:08:19] <Ralyks_Larettil> is he scumballing with memeing metarax yet? has he fallen to the dark dankness of warframe
[1:08:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> damage ward
[1:08:24] <Everpresent_Overseer> Nezha used doom on you
[1:08:26] <%voisraikien> @AngriestPat You know all the people you're playing with are snipe joining you for the most part right?
[1:08:27] <Maverick2736> the 82% is how much health that ring shield has left
[1:08:27] <+skibbz_> 69% tieNice
[1:08:28] <$Bncbck> it's pronouned nuh - tzha
[1:08:30] <@PlagueOfGripes> Pat is that teammate.
[1:08:31] <+ajcritfumble> its like iron skin but weaker and adds a knock down to your body
[1:08:32] <+MikoNoPants> Nezha is male and is based on Chinese mythos
[1:08:34] <TheInkshow> LUL
[1:08:34] <%TheGamerBendito> Just enjoy the Hoola~~
[1:08:35] <thelonechris> Why is Pat complaining about a beneficial effect?
[1:08:39] <Gorgen> It protects
[1:08:40] <MadOx__> @AngriestPat that blocks damage. a friendly frame
[1:08:43] <+babyacid> Shield
[1:08:44] <+dickbuttwoman> It's your iron skin but for the whole praty
[1:08:44] <+SwdVengeance> @AngriestPat It's overshield basically
[1:08:45] <Caivyre> It's the lack of skill meter
[1:08:47] <%Dingus_Tickler> @ssaryn That’s what I remember. The only frame that’s tempted me is Saryn for that fat ass
[1:08:47] <+gutlesscoward> @AngriestPat you could just ask them
[1:08:48] <Worldbrand> blowing up the coolant is fine because the fuel cell is by far the fastest mode of sabotage
[1:08:48] <The_Maddness> @AngriestPat 82% of damage immunity
[1:08:50] <Divryne> My boy Nezha.
[1:08:51] <GrandpaFlipfox> The hoola hoop is basically a second iron skin
[1:08:52] <Aleate> 69% Nice
[1:08:52] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat It's a temporary buff
[1:08:53] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat Health and armor basically
[1:08:54] <reaperx186> its an overshield that also stuns nearby enemy
[1:08:54] <TheInkshow> u umb
[1:08:55] <%ZalotAngel> @angriestpat it's a shield basically
[1:08:56] <+ssjklyco> Its basically free shjild
[1:08:58] <+ssjklyco> shield
[1:08:59] <%breakfastmegapowers> I need a game that when you cause damage you have to write a letter of apology to retain your buffs
[1:08:59] <+ZalgoTheWickedGod> Is Pat hating on Best boys help?
[1:08:59] <%ssaryn> Pat is that guy who clicks the buff OFF of him Kappa
[1:09:00] <MadOx__> Nezeha sheild
[1:09:00] <+magikestral> @angriestpat its iron skin, but fire
[1:09:00] <@PlagueOfGripes> this would be easy to explain, but.
[1:09:04] <ShazBo2000> Nezha is a child god
[1:09:05] <$psydaku> my Nezha
[1:09:09] <GoldeNOVA> @AngriestPat You should get a Tigris
[1:09:12] <+ajcritfumble> @Dingus_Tickler you mean ivara
[1:09:14] <%Ele_On_A_Uni> @AngriestPat it's nezha's hula hoop, it's basically iron skin except he can cast it on other players with an augment
[1:09:15] <HorribleHog> H-Hoopz? Is that you?
[1:09:15] <MadOx__> How are you doing today Plague?
[1:09:16] <+Skookah> hoola hoop is +15% style
[1:09:18] <reaperx186> nezha amaterasu skin when?
[1:09:28] <Rentixx> I think it reflects bullet damage
[1:09:28] <The_Maddness> Iron skin give you armr
[1:09:36] <+MikoNoPants> Pat isnt MR for the normal tigris
[1:09:36] <The_Maddness> Nezha give you Damage immunity
[1:09:38] <%ssaryn> @Dingus_Tickler Oh EASILY, she became my main for a while.
[1:09:39] <+SuichiTanaka> The nav points are commonly really confusing.
[1:09:41] <NMEDom> UPGRADE
[1:09:45] <deviljhojho94> Pat you need to kill them
[1:09:46] <+AntithesisEK> giving a chinese war god a japanese sun god skin 🤔
[1:09:54] <Worldbrand> Falling into pits resets your buffs
[1:09:55] <+ZalgoTheWickedGod> Its a better version of your Iron skin.
[1:09:57] <%Dingus_Tickler> @ajcritfumble Doesn’t Ivara just have bone hips and a lean ass? Saryn has a plump, delicious ass
[1:09:58] <+AntithesisEK> @reaperx186 that said, I recommend looking at his deluxe concept art
[1:09:59] <reaperx186> it negates a certain amount of damage,but also stun and damage nearby enemy
[1:09:59] <LeafarOznolam> did pat do second dream already
[1:10:00] <%ssaryn> YOU'RE TOO SLOW Kappa
[1:10:01] <OkamiDude15> FeelsBadMan
[1:10:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hmmmm
[1:10:07] <Gorgen> Too thicc.
[1:10:09] <+Boba_Fetish> Is he playing on ps4 or pc?
[1:10:10] <mr_slaide> Perfectly calibrated tv.
[1:10:10] <Spydurman> sure
[1:10:10] <+magikestral> @leafaroznolam he's barely done mars
[1:10:12] <deviljhojho94> Chinese and japanese gods are the same
[1:10:13] <diiizle> Is there a benefit to playing with a party over solo?
[1:10:15] <%InkblotBlues> You're a big boi, but also a slow boi
[1:10:15] <glacialbluebird> Thicc
[1:10:15] <+RooterMcGavin> are intercept missions the worst shit ever? survey says yes
[1:10:17] <deviljhojho94> Just like canadian and american gods
[1:10:18] <+Mrlasttruth> @AngriestPat NO NO YOU"RE TOO SLOW
[1:10:19] <Caidezes> Pat's old. Cut him some slack.
[1:10:20] <+ajcritfumble> @Dingus_Tickler nah dude ivara thicc as hell
[1:10:20] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @AngriestPat Do you know about spamming your 1 though?It costs less the more you use it in quick succession
[1:10:21] <@thenefftw> Pat is way too far away from doing Second Dream
[1:10:21] <%Stinzik> I mean he could always go Gas, gas, gas frame
[1:10:23] <+MikoNoPants> Im sure the normal tigris is now MR7 or MR10
[1:10:23] <%Dingus_Tickler> @ssaryn I really enjoyed her AoE Style when I unlocked her Prime
[1:10:27] <HorribleHog> Frame is so heavy it's affecting the speed of your controls
[1:10:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> LOOK AT THE FEYARCH SKIN
[1:10:28] <Rafafidi> The hula hoop is MORE armor
[1:10:30] <StarSkullyman> Pat you are the slowest controller player I know
[1:10:36] <reaperx186> i know about the deluxe skin but i want it now,dont even know when it drops
[1:10:40] <LeafarOznolam> second dream pat
[1:10:42] <+ruddyredbone> Is pat doing his part to help the sanctuary yet
[1:10:44] <The_Maddness> how
[1:10:45] <+ajcritfumble> @Dingus_Tickler saryns the one with the heaviest ballistics
[1:10:46] <deviljhojho94> Fat Belly Squad
[1:10:46] <%GarbageNirvana> Currently farming Nyx
[1:10:49] <+Robopengy> I bounced off this game really hard playing solo, is it better with teammates?
[1:10:49] <LeafarOznolam> time to wake up
[1:10:54] <+Nohamforsam> monkaS
[1:10:58] <%InkblotBlues> WRONG
[1:10:59] <deviljhojho94> monkaS
[1:11:00] <Gorgen> Bad go to maroo
[1:11:01] <OkamiDude15> lilyS
[1:11:01] <EASrake> pupper Wowee
[1:11:01] <+ZalgoTheWickedGod> I should start playing Warframe again.
[1:11:03] <%ssaryn> @Dingus_Tickler Still easily one of the best in the game, and it allows her to go for Melee buffs super easily along with it as long as you got the energy for it.
[1:11:05] <%Dingus_Tickler> @ajcritfumble I might need to re-check on that. I have Ivara but only put like 3 hours on her a year ago
[1:11:07] <%InkblotBlues> apatWrong
[1:11:09] <booterdagg> (loud sweating)
[1:11:15] <Spydurman> nononononono
[1:11:21] <Warfey> limesS
[1:11:25] <+AntithesisEK> @Robopengy unless teammates are not needed or DETRIMENTAL to your progress, there is no reason not to play with people because you gain more experience.
[1:11:25] <MonsieurHedge> oh man, pat has so few stars
[1:11:30] <Stol3nheart> It takes 4 but is worth more than the other one
[1:11:32] <@PlagueOfGripes> have you done Maroo this week?
[1:11:34] <thelonechris> Look at this RE4 treasure item
[1:11:37] <EASrake> so much tasty endo
[1:11:38] <MonsieurHedge> i dont even know what its like to not have like 700 of each star
[1:11:41] <%Stinzik> Not wrong
[1:11:41] <%IllusionKiller522> @AngriestPat get tigris its an amazing shotgun
[1:11:43] <%InkblotBlues> Just shove it in there, Pat.
[1:11:43] <Twoiis> ... I don't know what that is.

[1:11:48] <Rogue657> @IllusionKiller522 He can't yet
[1:11:50] <%ssaryn> That's a nice big dumb sex object weight you got on.
[1:11:50] <deviljhojho94> some kind of birb figure
[1:11:51] <AtlasMcCoy> But it's a pretty paperweight

[1:16:46] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> If only
[1:16:47] <Spydurman> if only
[1:16:48] <Aleate> @AngriestPat Might I ask how one joins the SBFP Clan? :)
[1:16:48] <nyseoul85> can you solo this game?
[1:16:49] <+Tokanova> Call him Plague on his Real Phone
[1:16:52] <+shawntk_> @PlagueOfGripes Get Woolie to play then Kappa
[1:16:53] <pennykettle_> This is hard
[1:16:55] <Stol3nheart> No, this is the void
[1:16:56] <+pantsureaper> @PlagueOfGripes LUL
[1:16:57] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @ssaryn the more important question is why wouldn’t you?
[1:16:59] <CertainlySyrix> Didn't he say you'd be with him for his next WF stream? @PlagueOfGripes
[1:17:00] <@JustinianKnight> he's got many Plague
[1:17:01] <drakthebest> Eotans? Since when where we doing a let's watch of AOT?
[1:17:02] <Wurd> Guide his hips @PlagueOfGripes Kreygasm
[1:17:05] <Thatghostpepper> yeah that was drunk inaros
[1:17:05] <%Vanishingtrooper> Has Pat tried the Index out yet?
[1:17:06] <%breakfastmegapowers> @PlagueOfGripes You'd be perfect for that!
[1:17:07] <quinnage7> HOW THE FUCK DOES HE HAVE MASTERY 6 ALREADY
[1:17:07] <Sulliman34> i highly expect him to fail this
[1:17:09] <+ChocalateDog203> casting Iron Skin with no enemies around barcTilt
[1:17:09] <OceanGovernor> Wait has he not been in the void?
[1:17:11] <$ThePaleSage> @plagueofgripes I know but sadly no such person exists
[1:17:13] <Zombrocom> This aint the derelict
[1:17:15] <%Mornaka> @PlagueOfGripes I'm sure someone like that will come along eventually
[1:17:19] <+sundizzle> @plagueofgripes yeah it sucks nobody is willing
[1:17:19] <drakthebest> 100% chance of him failing this
[1:17:19] <+ZalgoTheWickedGod> It literally said the void...
[1:17:19] <%ssaryn> @Gr4ndm4rsh4ll And the question after that is How COULDN'T you?
[1:17:22] <$SGrim> @PlagueOfGripes yeah, if only you, or any of us here, knew anything which could help about this game we may have been playing for 5 years. BrokeBack
[1:17:22] <pennykettle_> @quinnage7 Ive been playing for like 5 days and I have mastery 5
[1:17:30] <fjarcob> look for weird rocks called ARGON
[1:17:32] <Ralyks_Larettil> @PlagueOfGripes hey plague, you even get your atlas farm done? I've seen your mastery rank skyrocket
[1:17:32] <CptHarlok> I've played this game for 2400 hours over the years, and somehow it's still entertaining to watch new players play.
[1:17:34] <@Fuggins4U> ... is this Destiny X Vanquish?
[1:17:37] <+omegasis> ooh we them warframe bois rn?
[1:17:41] <Stol3nheart> @quinnage7 hes been playing for weeks now and is coming up on 60 hours or something

[1:17:55] <+SuichiTanaka> @Fuggins4U Yeah, that's pretty apt
[1:17:56] <+thedannydarko> More like Destiny is this game minus Vanquish
[1:17:59] <+mr_big411> Vanquiny?
[1:18:03] <@Fuggins4U> ....damn, ok, downloading.
[1:18:05] <pennykettle_> Should I unbind the sprint key? Switch it with crouch? When do you ever spring
[1:18:06] <ApparentReality> @PlagueOfGripes Atlas is so damn good
[1:18:07] <BlacSoul> Should we blow him up for it @PlagueOfGripes ? We're going to anyway but should we?

[1:19:26] <@PlagueOfGripes> I have all of them aside from wukong, nezha, gara and equinox
[1:19:28] <@thenefftw> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[1:19:30] <drakthebest> These missions kind of suck
[1:19:30] <+SuichiTanaka> @AngriestPat These are always confusing the first time. You basically need to know the route.
[1:19:30] <SunsetJack> You'll fail a few time until you know the way basically...
[1:19:39] <@PlagueOfGripes> Pat you really need someone to show you how to run those things.
[1:19:41] <NekoFAIA> you can go through the door though
[1:19:44] <$Bncbck> ! NAVIGATION AT RISK !
[1:19:44] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> @SuichiTanaka Completely. I ran into one and it blew my mind.
[1:19:45] <@JustinianKnight> the race part, not that early
[1:19:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> day 700 login reward tomorrow
[1:19:46] <Sulliman34> the puzzle changes every time
[1:19:49] <CertainlySyrix> to be fair the pit is full of glowing death lasers
[1:19:49] <Solidus_113> no plague, let him learn
[1:19:51] <sirrice77> @AngriestPat You cant die from falls at all
[1:19:53] <Inebriateddonut> You'll figure it out pat
[1:19:54] <Sulliman34> itll take some time to get used to all of them
[1:19:54] <@PlagueOfGripes> oh god, when he starts trying to get corrupted mods.
[1:19:59] <+DontMindMee> yeah it is an obstacle course
[1:20:01] <anon_1307> lol
[1:20:02] <Worldbrand> You sorta know it or you don't, like most spy vaults
[1:20:08] <+SuichiTanaka> In addition, the damn nav point lies
[1:20:10] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> So how many people in here have Excalibur Prime, just wondering? KappaPride
[1:20:12] <@JustinianKnight> there are a few variations of the course
[1:20:14] <@Fuggins4U> no Plague don't listen
[1:20:15] <%Tman451> Theres 3 different kinds of puzzles
[1:20:15] <deviljhojho94> yer badd
[1:20:16] <Ralyks_Larettil> @PlagueOfGripes equinox is a pain in the asshole, wukong and nezha are both from the dojo
[1:20:17] <alpharius88> just wait to the lua puzzles
[1:20:17] <Desreith> @fruit_pie_the_magician don't get on
[1:20:18] <%ssaryn> Pat's doing his best.
[1:20:19] <@PlagueOfGripes> you ASKED me to!
[1:20:19] <Sulliman34> oh lord the lua puzzle rooms
[1:20:22] <+ajcritfumble> theres like 5-6 different puzzle rooms and its kinda just a case of learning a route for each
[1:20:24] <@Fuggins4U> lambast this simpleton
[1:20:25] <Stol3nheart> It does not change every time
[1:20:26] <Sunstalker> @AngriestPat There's a door that closes at the very end that you need to get inside of before time runs down to get as much treasure as you can
[1:20:27] <+Skookah> corrupted mods are easy tho, just go at a snail's pace
[1:20:27] <BourneWarrior> No do it more
[1:20:28] <BlacSoul> POINT AND LAUGH
[1:20:29] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @plagueofgripes stahp, he’s already dead
[1:20:29] <Croetec> vault runs will be calculus level of difficult for him
[1:20:32] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[1:20:33] <ShazBo2000> Shhh plague just let him equip all the corrupted keys
[1:20:36] <pennykettle_> Wait you can retry this? I thought it was one try a week
[1:20:38] <+ZalgoTheWickedGod> That just makes us laugh harder.

[1:20:49] <@PlagueOfGripes> you asked me to help tonight and you're not accepting it now
[1:20:51] <Worldbrand> you can only equip one corrupted key at a time tho
[1:20:51] <CertainlySyrix> Yup @omegasis
[1:20:52] <%LunarSilence> "corrupt a mod"
[1:20:53] <CptHarlok> Well... You can always trade plat for the corrupted mods Pat

[1:24:28] <%deadpalvgz> pat they're just making you feel bad, that loots not so important
[1:24:28] <PhantaniumOG> you can find those rooms in the void normally though
[1:24:28] <Ixiah> JUST DO IT PERFECTLY
[1:24:28] <+ajcritfumble> they drop multishot mods theyre HUGE for newer players
[1:24:29] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> Pat in his attempts to look cool and go fast misses EVERYTHING
[1:24:32] <Zenduviq> Just farm void missions and you'll find plenty of those rooms.
[1:24:34] <CertainlySyrix> You can go back in there but you won't get another sculpture @AngriestPat
[1:24:35] <$Bncbck> the other loot boces are super worthless tho @AngriestPat
[1:24:35] <bwong1231> You can actually ask Maroo to run it again (after many times)
[1:24:36] <Stol3nheart> @PlagueOfGripes those rooms spawn naturally in the void, they just don't have the statues
[1:24:37] <deviljhojho94> How's it feel Pat? To be a biiiiiiiiiiiitch
[1:24:38] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> Do you play anymore @Inebriateddonut ? I've just put so many hours into it I got my money's worth.

[1:24:42] <%prisefighter1188> going to bed night everyone @plagueofgripes I hope pat doesn't drive you too crazy
[1:24:44] <Everpresent_Overseer> There is a higher chance to get rare mods from the containers in that room
[1:24:44] <%breakfastmegapowers> "You couldn't have done better"- Pat
[1:24:44] <applesonthemoon> @AngriestPat should've let plague sama guide your hips LIKE YOU SAID YOU WOULD
[1:24:48] <bwong1231> You wont get the sculpture again but you can farm the containers
[1:24:49] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat this is how we learn. Don't take it too hard. SeemsGood Alternatively, internalize this failure, and torture yourself over it for days! DarkMode
[1:24:50] <puhff> or just play eso
[1:24:55] <SunsetJack> Continuity is one of them.
[1:24:57] <%TheGamerBendito> @AngriestPat ♫ You can run if you want you, you can leave your loot behind ♫ apatPorgmo

[1:25:05] <%TaifuDragon> To weekly reset
[1:25:05] <%deadpalvgz> you can just go to the void and do missions there pat, it's from wednesday?
[1:25:05] <Aleate> I think it resets tomorrow...?
[1:25:05] <drakthebest> No you can still do it you'll just not get a sculpture out of it
[1:25:06] <+Skookah> I actually literally just continuity from that exact room
[1:25:07] <Inebriateddonut> @TheyCallMeVincenzo yup I still do, but I take breaks every now and again
[1:25:07] <Worldbrand> Those treasure rooms can spawn in random missions in the void though, and they're not that valuable
[1:25:08] <mcevers> The statue is one week, you can go find the challenge rooms WHENEVER
[1:25:08] <$serpenttucker> @AngriestPat Once a DAY dude
[1:25:08] <+DontMindMee> similar to Monster hunter's week reset
[1:25:08] <ShazBo2000> I’ll be honest Pat they’re not that great

[1:25:10] <HowlingSamurai> I Love You PAT
[1:25:11] <GoldeNOVA> You can go to the Void, it's an area
[1:25:12] <+SwdVengeance> Once you get to the void area, you can find those challenge rooms in regular missions
[1:25:12] <SunsetJack> Nah, it spawns in void maps Pat, don't worry.
[1:25:13] <thelastman87> reset*
[1:25:14] <bwong1231> You can ask maroo to run it again, she'll say no at first but you can ask many times
[1:25:16] <Croetec> its unique to the tileset not the mission
[1:25:19] <sunny935> can always go to the void pat
[1:25:19] <Stol3nheart> Its on a specific day, doesn't matter when you do them
[1:25:21] <TheButtravage> Ooooooh, that's what the stars are for...
[1:25:24] <+AcidicHorizon> You can also get that stuff once you get to the void tileset.
[1:25:25] <%ZalotAngel> @angriestpat every Monday
[1:25:25] <ShazBo2000> Those mods aren’t that great
[1:25:26] <TheButtravage> Shit.

[1:26:00] <%breakfastmegapowers> Pat is good at this, I wish he had someone to ask for advice though
[1:26:05] <+magikestral> @angriestpat has the game told you anything about these precursor assholes yet
[1:26:05] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @angriestpat just get to the Void, the tile sets there always usually spawn a challenge room like that
[1:26:08] <Warfey> boop
[1:26:12] <%Awesomania> a bada bing bada boom
[1:26:12] <+GingerSenpai01> Boop is a fun map.
[1:26:13] <thelastman87> Hey, who remembers when the void was the endgame?
[1:26:13] <EASrake> The void is also the place to farm argon crystals
[1:26:16] <bitjama> ah sedna, the grind game is strong
[1:26:16] <Stol3nheart> boop boop
[1:26:19] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> 'Getting Gud' Kappa
[1:26:21] <SunsetJack> That's where you get Argon by the way.
[1:26:24] <+SuichiTanaka> @AngriestPat If you need to go around various obstacles on the ground, Shift Dodge then Crouch Slide in a different direction. Helps a lot with getting through tricky places.
[1:26:24] <%Tman451> beep boop son, beep boop
[1:26:27] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> His Crazy Talk was working when he said that Kappa
[1:26:27] <TheButtravage> I had no idea, the statues have slots for gems lol
[1:26:28] <Grendrox> @AngriestPat You can always go to the void mission with a chance to have those rooms appear.
[1:26:29] <%Stinzik> "I'm starting to understand this" Ooooooh baby

[1:26:36] <applesonthemoon> PAT PLEASE
[1:26:36] <reaperx186> @angriestpat you can also do the runs while exploring the void area to try to gurantee the actual good mods that are reccomended for 90% of frames,you have the weaker cracked version of those mods

[1:30:51] <HorribleHog> Do you play with a controller when people are watching laeHmm
[1:30:51] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> Plague asserts domonance.
[1:30:52] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> I don't quite know the lore but Space Mom seems cool
[1:30:52] <CptHarlok> Space dad's never around either. I don't even know who he is.
[1:30:53] <deviljhojho94> Since pat knew plague is handsome he gets nervous when he watches. Makes sense Keepo
[1:30:53] <%InkblotBlues> I thought @PlagueOfGripes was there to guide your hips?
[1:30:54] <TheInkshow> stupid sexy plague
[1:30:55] <%Sesshastings> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead listen to your mother
[1:30:55] <%Stinzik> Plague makes you nervous? Why is that, is it his cutting wit?
[1:30:57] <Aleate> Energy Siphon is needed Kreygasm
[1:30:58] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> Space Mom is Canadian.
[1:31:05] <%breakfastmegapowers> Space mom, has got it going on, she's all I want and I've waited for so long
[1:31:08] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pat you need a aura Mod called Energy SIphon if you want to use you ability alot.
[1:31:11] <+Fenrirlives> Ever since I learned Plague was attractive, I've lost all confidence in myself!
[1:31:14] <C_game_me_811> @prostipate Hello
[1:31:17] <%TheGamerBendito> BUT Plague is always watching!
[1:31:20] <%captainthunderwolf> @Stinzik Probably his raw foot in height.
[1:31:22] <EASrake> yeah basically
[1:31:24] <caja_de_ojos> All hail space mom
[1:31:24] <+LymonRage> Yeah energy siphon is a must
[1:31:27] <CertainlySyrix> Plague honestly looks just like his avatar.
[1:31:29] <$Bncbck> Zenurik 4 lyfe
[1:31:34] <deviljhojho94> @Fenrirlives i was straight before that video tbh
[1:31:34] <%legendfather_of_giants> wall grooves
[1:31:37] <deviljhojho94> dont regret it
[1:31:43] <EASrake> wow he did it
[1:31:45] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> @AngriestPat Especially in the beta before they retreated her lines, Space Mom constantly said 'about' with the SMALLEST twinge of an accent.
[1:31:45] <pennykettle_> I love the spy mission rooms, so many ways to do it. I feel like a role player
[1:31:47] <+TardyClock> Oh man
[1:31:49] <Ralyks_Larettil> energy siphon is for scrubs who don't know about corrosive projection
[1:31:49] <%captainthunderwolf> @CertainlySyrix Gotta give the man props for not sexing himself up with his personal avatar.
[1:31:51] <+TardyClock> That was fucking SLICK
[1:31:52] <booterdagg> smooth like butter
[1:31:55] <+AXL808> use the other vent
[1:32:00] <invertedrealm> Waiting for Pat to trip with his HUGENESS

[1:32:42] <ape_hawk> yes
[1:32:42] <Gorgen> Hack the planet!
[1:32:43] <+T_Sasquatch> lol , i just blast my way past and do it as tense as possible
[1:32:44] <%deadpalvgz> the tutorials in this game are bad
[1:32:44] <EASrake> LUL
[1:32:45] <%TaifuDragon> Yes
[1:32:45] <%captainthunderwolf> Is this Sagani?
[1:32:45] <%s_xylocalsingles> yes
[1:32:45] <Aleate> Pretty much
[1:32:45] <$serpenttucker> yes
[1:32:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yes lol
[1:32:48] <Stol3nheart> Yeah
[1:32:48] <invertedrealm> Yes
[1:32:49] <+didyouthinkofthis> sort of
[1:32:49] <Worldbrand> hahahaha
[1:32:50] <%captainthunderwolf> Is this VA Sagani?
[1:32:51] <bwong1231> Yes
[1:32:52] <+DontMindMee> Warframe TM
[1:32:56] <geckko12> pretty much
[1:32:58] <Severcide> Yep
[1:32:59] <KingOfTheGeats> this game sucks at explaining shit to you
[1:33:00] <+TootPirate> This quest came with the update that added these missions @AngriestPat
[1:33:02] <ape_hawk> omg, it IS sagani
[1:33:03] <glacialbluebird> Yuuuuup
[1:33:04] <CptHarlok> Yeah... Warframe's not too good at pacing.
[1:33:07] <%InkblotBlues> Warframe is weird. Surprise.
[1:33:09] <%breakfastmegapowers> SlutFrame TM
[1:33:11] <bwong1231> the first 4 quests are tutorial missions
[1:33:11] <Sulliman34> you were supposed to do this quests a long while ago
[1:33:14] <invertedrealm> Remember, the map didn't used to be that way. There were no progression. The map was open access.
[1:33:14] <ape_hawk> space mom is ranger mom
[1:33:17] <Caidezes> This is why you should always do the quests first.
[1:33:22] <+crdy93> Oh no puzzles......
[1:33:22] <quinnage7> @angriestpat Warframe has a good amount of legacy content
[1:33:22] <Deductivemist> My dog just hatched!
[1:33:24] <OkamiDude15> @AngriestPat what do you mean you havent gotten ending A of warframe?! lytOUCH
[1:33:25] <%captainthunderwolf> @ape_hawk Fuck yeah, someone else heard it. You're cool, ape_hawk.
[1:33:25] <Stol3nheart> The planets and missions had a somewhat different order before, and mahroos bazhaar got moved
[1:33:25] <invertedrealm> ...Before they updated it and forgot to update the quests
[1:33:25] <+magikestral> @angriestpat quests that get added in updates always do this kind of shit
[1:33:31] <%Tman451> rhino, this is a sneaking mission
[1:33:32] <+AXL808> well they were trying to make it more accessible while also filling out the world
[1:33:46] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> What's his MR?
[1:33:55] <%breakfastmegapowers> At least shes not Space Mom In-Law
[1:33:56] <Ethatre> 6
[1:33:59] <$ThePaleSage> 6
[1:34:01] <bitjama> silen weapon much pat?
[1:34:01] <invertedrealm> They forgot to update quest progression when they locked planets behind an updated progression map.
[1:34:06] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> He'll be 16 in like a week it seems.
[1:34:09] <+jezred14> lmao I cant believe how slow this game looks with a controller
[1:34:11] <+Skookah> stealthy spies always fire high powered rifles during top secret missions
[1:34:25] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> @jezred14 I like it, the game is a little too jittery as it is.
[1:34:30] <+Skookah> masks the sound of their failure
[1:34:38] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> I wish the combat was a little more slower honestly.
[1:34:39] <OmegaTrigun> ya it felt real great starting this game up again on earth and it was telling me to go to mercury, when i played last i started on mercury and wa going to earth
[1:34:45] <Rafafidi> well, that was easy...
[1:34:46] <DarkSkyKing> You know, the movement reminds me of Dream Drop Distance a little. Though its way better here.
[1:34:47] <Ralyks_Larettil> level zero spy missions, ahhh the memorys
[1:34:53] <%captainthunderwolf> The Corpus are so fucking wise to it.
[1:34:54] <Stol3nheart> These are simplified missions for the quest. they normally have more lasers
[1:35:01] <+ajcritfumble> rhino best for corpus spy missions because you just run through the lasers and hack it before the timer ez
[1:35:02] <+AXL808> The HIGHEST level of Corpus security systems, the best money can buy
[1:35:03] <dissmech> Y U P SHE DOES
[1:35:03] <CptHarlok> @jezred14 Yeah, tried it on PS4 with friends, but I can't stand it. I started with PC way back.
[1:35:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> lol wait til he gets to lua spy
[1:35:04] <%breakfastmegapowers> Why is hacking equivalent to a childrens puzzle
[1:35:06] <blackorchidKI2> Just wait until Pat starts needing cyphers from how hard the control panels can be
[1:35:07] <NekoFAIA> how can they be wise to it if they're dead
[1:35:12] <alpharius88> it's a really old quest
[1:35:15] <EASrake> yeah man game is weird and fun
[1:35:16] <ape_hawk> good weird or bad weird?
[1:35:16] <+FadingEmber> @AngriestPat you know Pat these systems use to be even worst Kappa
[1:35:17] <%Stinzik> Ahhh, to not remember the War Within
[1:35:18] <%captainthunderwolf> It's fascinating that the Corpus have no security camera.
[1:35:25] <+AXL808> it gets weider
[1:35:27] <+dickbuttwoman> YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHIN YET
[1:35:38] <yrmix> dead
[1:35:38] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> ITS GETS WEIRDER
[1:35:38] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> Get your glasses Pat! Kappa
[1:35:41] <glacialbluebird> Graceful
[1:35:44] <+ajcritfumble> this is tame hold on to your butt
[1:35:45] <keiji_maede> Why is warframe fun? o.o
[1:35:48] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> The loop.
[1:35:50] <%Mornaka> !SIGHT AT RISK!
[1:35:53] <Ralyks_Larettil> I can't wait for pat to learn the ancient ninja art of bullet jump, jump cancel, aim gllide cancel into dodge roll.
[1:35:54] <OkamiDude15> but pat this game would be better with tank controls tho Kappa
[1:35:54] <ape_hawk> be nice to Sagani, pat
[1:35:55] <KwakuAnansi> cheer200 Hey Pat it's nice seeing you get into Warframe. Also I just got Vauban Prime and all I can say is screw it's build requirements.
[1:35:56] <$SGrim> @breakfastmegapowers possible in-universe explanation: the Warframes are biomechanical, so they natural interface with machines meaning they would see complex programs as simply something to link together.
[1:35:56] <+ajcritfumble> because you do combo
[1:35:59] <%captainthunderwolf> @keiji_maede People like being robots and killing stuff with magic.
[1:36:00] <+ArcticAsylum> Is this game worth it? No one wants to shut up about it
[1:36:02] <yrmix> god that ninja chick annoying
[1:36:04] <PowerArmorMeow> Pat's Journey through Warframe is going to be Grand
[1:36:05] <+Psyco6> YO WHENS FUGGIMS COMIN BACK?
[1:36:07] <DotDusk> don't trip though
[1:36:12] <+Psyco6> FUGGINS
[1:36:13] <booterdagg> it's free, try it yourself
[1:36:16] <Justafleshwound> this game consistently ups the ante on it's bizarreness. it never stops
[1:36:16] <EASrake> Yeah you type on that wall
[1:36:17] <+FragmentNation> use your dick to solve the puzzle
[1:36:25] <%Sendrak70> Is it just me or does this game handle better with a controller over a mouse?
[1:36:25] <%captainthunderwolf> @ArcticAsylum It's worth the high price of literally free to try, so it depends what premium you put on your time.
[1:36:31] <CptHarlok> @ArcticAsylum Well, it's free. I'd say it's worth an hour or two to try it out.
[1:36:31] <deviljhojho94> HACKERMAN
[1:36:32] <Stol3nheart> Those at turrets
[1:36:33] <TranquilTurnip> we will protect our base with childs puzzles

[1:36:53] <%captainthunderwolf> Stupid Corpus, protecting their servers with octagons.
[1:36:57] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> She's just a very hopeful person!
[1:36:57] <%breakfastmegapowers> I'm a pale imitator of a boy in the sky, with a hat on his head and a knot in his tie

[1:37:24] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> Elmo knows he's giving attention to some other thing like the TV or something, and he gets jealous.
[1:37:25] <Gorgen> Elmo wants to know when Khorra is coming out
[1:37:35] <EASrake> man i can't wait until spoilers

[1:40:01] <Aleate> No one ever expects the Archwing mission! LUL
[1:40:02] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @grendrox a very unexpected horror game

[1:40:05] <jagchan> Hey look! Its a Gummi ship mission!
[1:40:06] <BaronVonWolfe> Yeah, it's super finnicky
[1:40:06] <OmegaTrigun> better? lolk
[1:40:09] <+T_Sasquatch> archwing is not as cool as it looks, lets be real. its weirdly controlled
[1:40:09] <Stol3nheart> Youre not protecting a
[1:40:11] <+Squishy_Friend> Damn ok, any specific ones or just any
[1:40:11] <+HelloImTom08> oh boy the worst part of the game LUL
[1:40:17] <MonsieurHedge> just leave the mission. this isnt worth it
[1:40:19] <+dickbuttwoman> WOOOO
[1:40:21] <Rogue657> @AngriestPat Good night, and good night stream. Archwing sucks.
[1:40:21] <Ralyks_Larettil> UI BUG TOO awesome
[1:40:22] <%breakfastmegapowers> RUN COWARD... I AM SINISTAR... RUN COWARD
[1:40:22] <MAX116030> can you create a guyver?
[1:40:23] <%Macbutters86> Fuck Im late. Just got off an 11 hour shift.
[1:40:24] <+dickbuttwoman> I GOT NIDAS
[1:40:25] <MonsieurHedge> nothing is worth archwing
[1:40:26] <NephiStreams> TRIGGER HAPPY!!!!!
[1:40:27] <+Bupkis7> It's not the best, but I kinda like it.
[1:40:28] <%IntrepidEye> Too bad its shit
[1:40:28] <mcevers> I really wish it was more like starfox
[1:40:29] <+PenmanLupine> you become a Darling in the Franx
[1:40:29] <Worldbrand> Well he's gotta rank up that archwing crap somehow
[1:40:30] <+ArcticAsylum> Literally have ass rockets
[1:40:30] <%TheBigO75> wtf is happening
[1:40:31] <Sunstalker> This is what's called cancer grinding for keys a while back.
[1:40:33] <+TsunamiPoro> ar chu
[1:40:33] <CptHarlok> It was forgotten pretty quickly.
[1:40:34] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> You have to lead your shots with your guns.
[1:40:34] <bitjama> i hate archwing missions
[1:40:38] <MonsieurHedge> why dont they just cut archwing like they did raids?
[1:40:39] <Piemen99> i thought these were pretty cool
[1:40:39] <%InkblotBlues> Can't stand the Archwing missions.
[1:40:42] <AtlasMcCoy> everyone hates archwing missions
[1:40:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> DARGIN
[1:40:44] <PowerArmorMeow> Archwing is fun but almost goes underplayed
[1:40:45] <Stol3nheart> Its really not that bad though
[1:40:46] <Shinmaddrox> These missions are annoying.
[1:40:48] <+dickbuttwoman> Archwing is fun when you play a lot of archwing
[1:40:48] <+Bloodxb> God velocitus is so garbage
[1:40:48] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> Its very pilot game esque.
[1:40:48] <HorribleHog> These are fun on mouse & keyboard
[1:40:51] <Gorgen> Imperator is hit scan
[1:40:52] <Ralyks_Larettil> its a very common UI bug
[1:40:53] <Worldbrand> UI bug?
[1:40:54] <+DeadlyToastY> Ah 3D combat
[1:40:54] <+d00msdaydan> because interceptio nis dogshit, that's why
[1:40:54] <$HowIPendragon> LOOKS GREAT but these missions suuuuuckk
[1:40:55] <mcevers> ui bug, it happens
[1:40:56] <+Bupkis7> 'Cause you suck!
[1:40:57] <%Gogogolem> Bug frame pat
[1:40:58] <YautjaBorne> Think i'll try one last time cause when i watch this game i want to play it then when i do just nothing lol

[1:41:00] <%InkblotBlues> Ui bug fun times
[1:41:01] <+ajcritfumble> ui bug
[1:41:01] <Caivyre> archwing would be great if it didn't control like ASS
[1:41:02] <Ixiah> UI BUG
[1:41:02] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> @Gorgonstork You have to lead your shot though.
[1:41:05] <Everpresent_Overseer> visual bug is great
[1:41:05] <+preppyposs> glitch
[1:41:06] <CertainlySyrix> I don't mind them that much but I wish the mods weren't so fuckin hard to get
[1:41:06] <MrNoobMcSalt> Thats a bug
[1:41:06] <+crocnor> its bugged
[1:41:07] <Stol3nheart> Its lying ot you
[1:41:07] <GoWestyy> there's pvp in this game right?
[1:41:07] <faegbeard> Tenno Zero
[1:41:08] <reaperx186> bug
[1:41:09] <bwong1231> its just a bug
[1:41:13] <HypeArbalest> Archwing are great
[1:41:14] <+DontMindMee> It is probably going up for the host
[1:41:14] <bwong1231> Bugframe
[1:41:15] <+preppyposs> that happens sometimes
[1:41:16] <Rogue657> @GoWestyy Yes, but it's a miniscule part
[1:41:17] <Solidus_113> @AngriestPat have you given the "Experimental flight" a try? there's an option for it in control settings
[1:41:17] <%Macbutters86> I miss space shooters
[1:41:17] <Ralyks_Larettil> @GoWestyy yes but no one does it
[1:41:18] <@PlagueOfGripes> those progress meters get bugged often
[1:41:20] <+didyouthinkofthis> thats a visual bug
[1:41:21] <+dickbuttwoman> Visual bug
[1:41:21] <+AXL808> @Grendrox Not till much later
[1:41:22] <@PlagueOfGripes> it's still going up
[1:41:22] <renegadekira> Same happened to me, just a bug I think. Mission Progress is still going up
[1:41:25] <grayjammer> visual bug yeah
[1:41:26] <%a_turnt_egg> LEL
[1:41:27] <CptHarlok> @GoWestyy There is, but no one really plays it
[1:41:30] <+preppyposs> yeah bug
[1:41:38] <%Beerswithbears> I love you Plague
[1:41:38] <+DontMindMee> Survive air % started bugging recently
[1:41:43] <%Beerswithbears> Hai
[1:41:48] <mcevers> USE THE MELEE
[1:41:49] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> @CptHarlok Except LUNARO Kappa
[1:41:52] <+ajcritfumble> hate the archwing shooting so i just melee the whole time
[1:41:52] <Rogue657> !uptime
[1:41:53] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 42m 1s.
[1:41:57] <$serpenttucker> LUL
[1:42:01] <Grendrox> You can always ask your team if they are seeing the same thing
[1:42:02] <+DeadlyToastY> If you pretend the frames are giant then its basically gundam
[1:42:03] <+FadingEmber> Pat should really invest in a tablet to display chat
[1:42:04] <Inebriateddonut> LUL "SEEKING" fire
[1:42:07] <GoWestyy> damn lol pve must be lit then
[1:42:08] <@thenefftw> Just finished relic farming and can now have my full attention here
[1:42:09] <$serpenttucker> They do home in, they just don't have good tracking
[1:42:14] <%a_turnt_egg> you are not cool, pat
[1:42:18] <CptHarlok> @TheyCallMeVincenzo I usually end up leaving queue on that after 5 minutes.
[1:42:28] <Shinmaddrox> seems pretty damn broken
[1:42:31] <Justafleshwound> on that archwing, the only useful ability is it's first one. adds fire damage and crit chance to all shots
[1:42:38] <OmegaTrigun> no not broken at all LUL
[1:42:39] <+ajcritfumble> nah its just ui its fine
[1:42:39] <TheInkshow> nah
[1:42:42] <grayjammer> its just a visualbug wait it out
[1:42:44] <sassyquatch963> working as intended
[1:42:47] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> @CptHarlok I very much like the aesthetics and the idea, but I played a year ago and ya, even then it was dead.
[1:42:49] <Seditary> yeah this has been long enough for a round to finish
[1:42:49] <SunsetJack> It's normal, it happens sometime.
[1:42:50] <%LGWPhanto> It's just UI, happens to me all the time
[1:42:50] <jagchan> its 420 all the time
[1:42:51] <%breakfastmegapowers> You Will (NOT) Advance
[1:42:57] <fjarcob> They probably don't fix archwing much because most people avoid it
[1:42:58] <%a_turnt_egg> It's Fine
[1:42:58] <Inebriateddonut> It just works Kappa
[1:42:58] <TyrantBelial> Pat puto n experimental fight
[1:43:05] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> @CptHarlok They should introduce hardcore rankings, and better rewards.
[1:43:09] <bwong1231> the mission is working fine
[1:43:09] <+KongolComet> @AngriestPat UI bugs are fairly common
[1:43:13] <glacialbluebird> Just a UI Issue. Chillax
[1:43:15] <%IntrepidEye> Probably bugged because you came in late.
[1:43:15] <@thenefftw> Yes
[1:43:17] <+AXL808> these don't take too long with 4 fully controlled nodes
[1:43:20] <EASrake> and you wouldn't have gotten these 'sweet' archwing mods Kappa

[1:43:28] <Ralyks_Larettil> experimental flight is for the non-bitches thankyou very much
[1:43:29] <OmegaTrigun> just a ui issue smh
[1:43:35] <Rafafidi> see, half way there
[1:43:36] <%a_turnt_egg> just fuck the computer Kappa
[1:43:39] <TehMud> if any enemy is in the circle njmber stops

[1:43:54] <@PlagueOfGripes> tennoversity
[1:43:55] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> Ya, the Odonata is kinda trash anyway.
[1:43:58] <@PlagueOfGripes> TENNO HOUSEEE
[1:44:04] <%a_turnt_egg> BLIND PAT
[1:44:05] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> Archwing abilities are never really good.
[1:44:10] <CptHarlok> @TheyCallMeVincenzo They tried with skins, but I think a lot of folks got scared off by the early days of "balanced the same as PVE" where peeps were doing 45K damage in a single shot.
[1:44:12] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> They should sup them up.
[1:44:22] <%ssaryn> Yo, finally playing a Skill playthrough in Bloodborne and have no idea what good skill weapons are other than the Blades of Mercy, help a Big Kirkhammer Boi out.
[1:44:28] <%breakfastmegapowers> Tenno Garden
[1:44:35] <%Beerswithbears> DO A!
[1:44:35] <+dickbuttwoman> Doing this mission with odonata prime is much better
[1:44:42] <Divryne> Ayy lmao.
[1:44:47] <%a_turnt_egg> do the game good
[1:45:03] <+quarkee> doing it with cancer boi is pretty good too
[1:45:05] <sassyquatch963> alertium
[1:45:06] <Grendrox> @AngriestPat You going to Tenno-con this year?
[1:45:07] <Worldbrand> Is nitain used in a lot of low-mr gear?
[1:45:10] <+AXL808> alert missions for nitain
[1:45:11] <$serpenttucker> @AngriestPat Not rare, but unlike the other resources, you can only get it as rewards from alerts
[1:45:16] <grayjammer> theres another place, but it sucks
[1:45:18] <@PlagueOfGripes> wonder if he's done any vauban alerts.
[1:45:25] <MadOx__> One of the later frames Vauban Prime takes 20 Naitain to make
[1:45:35] <%breakfastmegapowers> I wanna play as a Metal Gear Wrecks
[1:45:35] <Gorgen> and 7000 oxium
[1:45:36] <OceanGovernor> It looks like archwing is even worse with a controller LUL
[1:45:41] <Worldbrand> The interception AI likes to pick a point and rush it
[1:45:46] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @madox__ it truly was hell to make him
[1:45:46] <%a_turnt_egg> like a dick flying right at your face
[1:45:47] <CptHarlok> How to Train Your Dargon with Pat.
[1:45:48] <Justafleshwound> @Worldbrand not really, mostly primes that are mr 8+
[1:45:48] <EASrake> Dargons man LUL
[1:45:50] <BourneWarrior> Archwings are so touchy I hate them
[1:45:51] <Ralyks_Larettil> @OceanGovernor the GAME is worse with a controller
[1:45:52] <Shaggnar> That's because they aren't your dargens :)
[1:45:53] <+ajcritfumble> i made daddyban prime the oxium hurt more than the nitain tbh
[1:45:55] <HorribleHog> OceanGovernor I didn't think it was possible for archwing to be worse
[1:45:57] <DantesAnimus> It's like he's speaking a different language
[1:45:59] <+Bupkis7> You're not as big a threat
[1:46:08] <+Nomicro4u> which warframe is the sexiest
[1:46:10] <TheInkshow> Is there a way to do interceptions solo?
[1:46:12] <+Nomicro4u> is the real question
[1:46:12] <%maskedriderhero> Is this ZoE?
[1:46:21] <deviljhojho94> Kill them all Paticio del Boivino
[1:46:21] <+quarkee> because they know youre using a controller so they avoid you and instead are attracted by the cool kids with real input devices
[1:46:22] <CertainlySyrix> khora @Nomicro4u
[1:46:24] <EASrake> Nonsense festival, Clown party
[1:46:30] <bwong1231> Elmo is a Warframe
[1:46:32] <NeroInfinite> honk
[1:46:33] <+Fenrirlives> an absolute TUMS FESTIVAL
[1:46:35] <+AXL808> Does Pat have a dojo?
[1:46:38] <BourneWarrior> Zephyr has the biggest butt
[1:46:40] <%a_turnt_egg> which warframe is a cumdaddy
[1:46:44] <+Nomicro4u> time for google comparison
[1:46:45] <Stol3nheart> @TheInkshow nova or nekros make it reasonably easy
[1:46:48] <fusioncell12> Which planet is Pat up to now?
[1:46:58] <urs0jb> @TheInkshow you can do interception solo, but you need specific loadouts and build to do it
[1:46:59] <CertainlySyrix> "real input devices" I've gotta save that one @quarkee
[1:47:03] <BlacSoul> I wish Archwings were better balanced, either you Stomp or get Stomped
[1:47:08] <HypeArbalest> They have range pat
[1:47:12] <MonsieurHedge> CUT ARCHWING NOW
[1:47:15] <fjarcob> People actually got upset at nitain only appearing on alerts so they drop on sabotage also
[1:47:21] <Gorgen> spam melee
[1:47:22] <@PlagueOfGripes> are you suggesting archwing may be a half baked game mode?
[1:47:22] <%a_turnt_egg> happy saint swithun's day everyone
[1:47:42] <OmegaTrigun> @plagueofgripes no not at all. more like quarter baked Kappa
[1:47:43] <sirrice77> Jank but cool, thats warfframe
[1:47:43] <+ajcritfumble> ye ye ye melee best arcwing
[1:47:46] <rodnavs> why are you playing with a controller you normie!!!
[1:47:50] <Ralyks_Larettil> @BlacSoul my archwing and archwing weapons all have 3-4 formas in them. there is no getting stomped :P
[1:47:57] <@thenefftw> The idea of Archwing is cool
[1:48:12] <OceanGovernor> I cant wait until Pat gets to the Jordas boss LUL
[1:48:14] <Everpresent_Overseer> Point A saved the day
[1:48:16] <%Macbutters86> DId Pat lose more weight or am I being a dink.
[1:48:17] <Gorgen> i put orange potatoe in amesha and i never take damage
[1:48:20] <%maskedriderhero> All those red targets makes me ache to see someone launch a volley of missiles
[1:48:22] <Worldbrand> Maybe we'll get a lunaro variant where we pilot dargyns, it'll be called dargyn ball
[1:48:28] <+ajcritfumble> grineer dont name good
[1:48:30] <$KwakuAnansi> They need to rework Archwing
[1:48:31] <+ajcritfumble> STUG
[1:48:32] <fusioncell12> How far is Pat now?
[1:48:32] <caja_de_ojos> What is a dargon
[1:48:34] <+ajcritfumble> STUBBA
[1:48:41] <+HelloImTom08> they need to DELETE archwing
[1:48:42] <urs0jb> most people get stomped on archwing because they never farmed mods for it
[1:48:44] <%deadpalvgz> yes there is
[1:48:46] <EASrake> Pop open that natain and drink it
[1:48:49] <%deadpalvgz> you gotta have a mass cc frame
[1:48:52] <sassyquatch963> git gud
[1:48:53] <Ixiah> put them into your frame
[1:48:54] <@PlagueOfGripes> you definitely can
[1:48:55] <%TaifuDragon> you can
[1:48:55] <AtlasMcCoy> you git gud
[1:48:55] <+SuichiTanaka> Yeah, you can do it solo pretty easily
[1:48:57] <%InkblotBlues> Go fast.
[1:48:59] <%TaifuDragon> since they rush one point a t a time
[1:48:59] <Ralyks_Larettil> You can absolutely do interception solo
[1:49:00] <+Fenrirlives> YOU DON'T WANT THAT
[1:49:01] <fazoburquina> @OceanGovernor I am sad he'll never see the bullshit shenanigans that was JV
[1:49:02] <@PlagueOfGripes> I used to a lot when I needed litsh
[1:49:02] <+HelloImTom08> why play solo, does pat hate people?
[1:49:03] <+Bloodxb> just run between points
[1:49:04] <+ajcritfumble> yes but you need to be able to move around fast
[1:49:04] <Gorgen> Not recommended
[1:49:04] <$serpenttucker> @AngriestPat There IS a way to do interception solo. Press the Triangle button
[1:49:05] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat put you matchmaking on "solo" and you can play missions solo
[1:49:05] <Everpresent_Overseer> it's called run super fast and kill everything
[1:49:06] <Caidezes> Just gotta be fast.
[1:49:07] <BlacSoul> @ralyks_larettil Feh, too much time not enough profit for that....... not jealous at all
[1:49:09] <fusioncell12> @AngriestPat switch matchmaking from public to solo
[1:49:09] <%a_turnt_egg> The daddiest planet
[1:49:10] <grayjammer> you run around like a crazyman
[1:49:11] <Worldbrand> It's definitely doable, but I dunno about earlier on. What you can do is take 3 points and forget the 4th.
[1:49:12] <PowerArmorMeow> To do interception solo you need Nidus
[1:49:13] <Sunstalker> You can. But you shouldn't.
[1:49:14] <mcevers> solo interception involves lots of CC
[1:49:17] <Aleate> "Finish an interception solo with a Hobbled Dragon Key with level 30+ Enemies" - RIven Challenge I get far too often FeelsBadMan
[1:49:19] <EASrake> Yeah just shove the spores in your mouth
[1:49:20] <Cloudy_TV> Pat how many frames do you have so far?
[1:49:21] <$Bncbck> it's real frame dependent
[1:49:24] <@thenefftw> You gotta go to Europa first
[1:49:24] <Croetec> what's it like to need nano spores...it's been so long...
[1:49:25] <%Roawjer1> range banshee build can solo intercepts easy
[1:49:26] <CertainlySyrix> You can do Solo interception with anyone
[1:49:28] <CertainlySyrix> it's not that hard
[1:49:29] <Inebriateddonut> oh geez I forgot extractors existed
[1:49:29] <Finaldragoon> RIP that extractor
[1:49:31] <dissmech> the ayatan mission had em by thr tonnes too
[1:49:34] <CertainlySyrix> You totally can do it
[1:49:35] <%Macbutters86> Oh hai, Plague/
[1:49:37] <faegbeard> OUR LAD V
[1:49:38] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat put your matchmaking on "solo" and you can play alone
[1:49:40] <CertainlySyrix> you don't even need a certain type of frame
[1:49:43] <fjarcob> Salad V
[1:49:44] <GiantRobort> lol soloing interception, screw that
[1:49:44] <+Sticky80sbaby> what godlike skin is that?
[1:49:46] <$Bncbck> i only ever play solo due to anxieties, and ivara absolutely trashes any interception
[1:49:48] <%ssaryn> Salad v.
[1:49:48] <EASrake> My ropa?
[1:49:48] <fruit_pie_the_magician> ooo i just made 75 plat

[1:50:14] <CertainlySyrix> @TheInkshow don't defend points, only attack ones already capped. just run around capping ones constantly, don't contest
[1:50:15] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat put your matchmaking on "solo" and you can play alone
[1:50:17] <+ajcritfumble> @DeadlyToastY ahahahahahaha fuck
[1:50:21] <fusioncell12> Pat's close to getting Valkyr now

[1:50:36] <%TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat Any way to get 1,500 more spores to get my dog?
[1:50:37] <Everpresent_Overseer> YES getting closer to Valkyr
[1:50:42] <%ssaryn> Pat needs to make an Elmo through Salad V.
[1:50:46] <caja_de_ojos> Kill alad v
[1:50:52] <@thenefftw> Muh boi Limbo
[1:50:55] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> NO DONT GO TO CETUS
[1:50:56] <PowerArmorMeow> You mod Nidus so you have crap duration, lots of efficiency and just spamlarva to controll the spawns A long as those enemies don't die no new ones will spawn
[1:50:57] <Aleate> Gara time PogChamp
[1:50:57] <+Ciphris> muh5
[1:50:58] <+magikestral> @angriestpat you should do A Man of Few Words
[1:51:00] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat put your matchmaking on "solo" and you can play alone
[1:51:01] <Stol3nheart> @Vikingincognito probably not. the game is all farming
[1:51:03] <PowerArmorMeow> also max range
[1:51:04] <+quarkee> as someone who just grinded extreme primals on ff14 for 6 hours straight would i like this game
[1:51:06] <+AXL808> Europa JUNCTION of Jupiter
[1:51:06] <EASrake> That is the reason
[1:51:09] <BaronVonWolfe> Not Cetus!
[1:51:09] <%ssaryn> @thenefftw I actually heard the rework did him wonders, that true?
[1:51:10] <+DeadlyToastY> @ajcritfumble Alad V is basically Pat's Philosophy Incarnate

[1:51:31] <AtlasMcCoy> You can make him prettier by spending more money
[1:51:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @angriestpat LOOK AT HIS SKINS
[1:51:34] <Everpresent_Overseer> King of Fairies
[1:51:36] <@thenefftw> @ssaryn I never played him beforehand, so I can't say for certain, but he's fun as hell
[1:51:38] <+quarkee> why isnt is pastel pink and green
[1:51:39] <%Macbutters86> Plague you dink. Be nice
[1:51:40] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat put your matchmaking on "solo" and you can play alone
[1:51:41] <BaronVonWolfe> continuity
[1:51:42] <Croetec> no feyarch pretty boi :(
[1:51:43] <Sulliman34> he doesnt have corrosive projection LuL
[1:51:46] <+dickbuttwoman> Yo PUMP those intensify and continuity
[1:51:47] <%voisraikien> NO
[1:51:50] <Piemen99> ew
[1:51:50] <Seditary> I played and left warframe before they changed the starmap and I come back to it now and then for new quests and I'm still not sure how I feel about it
[1:51:51] <%voisraikien> YOU DO A MAN OF FEW WORDS
[1:51:55] <%voisraikien> CLEM
[1:51:55] <Gorgen> Intensify
[1:51:58] <%voisraikien> GRAKATA
[1:52:00] <%ssaryn> @thenefftw Alright, i'll definitely be looking into him then.
[1:52:02] <fjarcob> you don't have a spare vitality?
[1:52:02] <CertainlySyrix> He looks like he's made out of watermelon candy.
[1:52:05] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat if you equip an aura it'll give you more energy points
[1:52:06] <fazoburquina> oh yeah, dont forget to put an Aura first
[1:52:09] <%deadpalvgz> you get auras from alerts
[1:52:09] <sunny935> why is pat neglecting his doggo?
[1:52:11] <%deadpalvgz> or other players pat
[1:52:12] <deviljhojho94> miss me with that magic shit
[1:52:14] <GodlyLuigi> guys he doesnt have an aura
[1:52:15] <%TaifuDragon> you have steel charge right?
[1:52:17] <%voisraikien> CLEM
[1:52:18] <Dairaipie> use your aura
[1:52:19] <MrNoobMcSalt> @AngriestPat if you have any aura mods you should put those on, they add mod capacity instead of subtract
[1:52:20] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat put your matchmaking on "solo" and you can play alone
[1:52:21] <+crimsonharvest> So Oberon is the king of the summer court right? Can we have Mab also?
[1:52:21] <drakthebest> Auras give you more mod points and also buff you. Corrosive projection is gotten through alerts
[1:52:22] <EASrake> buy dog
[1:52:22] <@PlagueOfGripes> the best aura in the game?
[1:52:23] <urs0jb> 2 and 3 are the important skills for oberon, you need to lvl up and get them
[1:52:25] <Aleate> NotLikeThis
[1:52:27] <deviljhojho94> we green bois, we like making noise
[1:52:30] <+Tokanova> he equiped nothing lmao
[1:52:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @angriestpat SKINS
[1:52:40] <Worldbrand> auras basically only pop up on alerts, so yeah he probably doesn't have (m)any
[1:52:42] <deviljhojho94> My name is oberon, im the leader of the crew
[1:52:45] <deviljhojho94> I love blackface
[1:52:46] <fazoburquina> @PlagueOfGripes that's not how you spell Growing Power Kappa (also heya!)
[1:52:48] <CertainlySyrix> Putting on auras gives you more slots @AngriestPat
[1:52:49] <deviljhojho94> And you'll love it too
[1:52:50] <%Stinzik> Steel Charge is nice sometimes for the extra capacity
[1:52:52] <%ssaryn> -30% armor to everything and the only reason to have a Dash polarity on EVERYTHING.

[1:54:23] <+TsunamiPoro> oh no
[1:54:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> an ostron is a little tiny man
[1:54:26] <fairore> playing Warframe with mouse and keyboard for the first time is hell NotLikeThis
[1:54:29] <Sulliman34> oh is this his first time in eidilon

[1:54:47] <mcevers> DO THE BOTTOM ONE
[1:54:48] <Stol3nheart> Prepare to load
[1:54:50] <flying_man_3> If I had had to slog through the Plains when I was first starting I prob wouldnt have made it to the 3 years I'm at now
[1:54:53] <@PlagueOfGripes> this is showcasing why the cetus system is bad
[1:54:53] <Volkrotia> O man first time bounty bois?
[1:54:54] <+quarkee> wait why wouldnt you play it with mouse and controller
[1:54:55] <flying_man_3> I feel bad for new players
[1:54:55] <+didyouthinkofthis> @AngriestPat some of those are way too high level for you
[1:54:59] <+PraiseTheSun20> I could never play warframe with controller personally lol
[1:55:00] <Ixiah> NINJAMASTER
[1:55:01] <%YabbaTroll> @AngriestPat you should go into the plains at night, very fun
[1:55:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat try to get hunter adrenaline, its a must on oberon
[1:55:09] <deviljhojho94> a thousand best pals play
[1:55:14] <fazoburquina> oh boy Plains exploring with no mods on his Oberon
[1:55:15] <+ZalgoTheWickedGod> Cetus is pretty bad.
[1:55:15] <TyrantBelial> Oh it's night time. . .
[1:55:18] <Stol3nheart> Oh boy its night time
[1:55:21] <@thenefftw> Night time? Time for fun
[1:55:21] <Sulliman34> welcome to the plains of eidilon
[1:55:21] <AtlasMcCoy> F
[1:55:23] <GodlyLuigi> night actually just finished
[1:55:23] <Volkrotia> Cetus is a perfectly fine Side thing
[1:55:24] <Ralyks_Larettil> I'm so fucking hyped to watch this burning garbage truck head on collision about to take place
[1:55:25] <%commanderclaw> Time to play FarcrFrame
[1:55:28] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> oH Night time
[1:55:37] <Volkrotia> Dont need anything from Cetus thats not only useful in cetus
[1:55:38] <fjarcob> uh oh
[1:55:38] <Gorgen> water is poison.
[1:55:42] <fairore> @ralyks_larettil hold up what!!!
[1:55:43] <fazoburquina> Big Boi time? PogChamp
[1:55:43] <%Macbutters86> This game IS better Destiny, eh.
[1:55:44] <%InkblotBlues> Oh geeze, Pat, you might want to go back and wait till morning.
[1:55:44] <%Macbutters86> Damnit
[1:55:45] <Manooz> so it doesn't because theres underwater missions
[1:55:47] <flying_man_3> "Makes sense" guess he doesnt know about sharkwing
[1:55:48] <+gutlesscoward> it's magnet water because reasons
[1:55:48] <sirrice77> I feel like Pat shouldn't be here considering he's still pretty new
[1:55:48] <fruit_pie_the_magician> its radioactive or something
[1:55:51] <Ixiah> Yeah survive space, die in water Kappa
[1:55:55] <Justafleshwound> @AngriestPat You don't really need to do Plains of Eidolon yet, because it's almost entirely self contained, progressing in planets is better early
[1:55:59] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat remember to climb the radio tower, and liberate the compounds on your way. BrokeBack
[1:56:00] <+Mrperson672> is that an unranked oberon?
[1:56:02] <reaperx186> regular water is poison,acidic water is fine for frames
[1:56:05] <TheInkshow> Go fishing
[1:56:05] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Whoa! This isn't a corridor!!! I thought this game was only corridors?!?
[1:56:09] <fjarcob> It's magnetic
[1:56:11] <+Ciphris> they just didn't want to put a new underwater system
[1:56:16] <deviljhojho94> is warframe the dark souls of blah blah
[1:56:18] <Worldbrand> That is actually less stupid than how grock-drool is actually pronounced
[1:56:20] <HorribleHog> Why don't they just use supersoakers against tenno laeHmm
[1:56:23] <count_bob> The world is a corridor @MainMan_Jonadiah
[1:56:23] <fusioncell12> @AngriestPat There's a bunch of resources unique to the plains
[1:56:25] <$Bncbck> @Ciphris but they do have an underwater system
[1:56:32] <Agami23> only need 5 more bathmodads for your arsene warframe
[1:56:33] <deviljhojho94> 🤔
[1:56:36] <%a_turnt_egg> love too play game and have no fun cuz im too low level
[1:56:36] <Rivalshotzgp> @ciphris they already have a underwater system...
[1:56:40] <Kindan55> What's Pat's Warframe name?
[1:56:42] <+Ciphris> i'm also guessing they didn't want to put sharkwing for one area in the plains
[1:56:46] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @count_bob Ya know, if you think about it, EVERYTHING can be a corridor.
[1:56:48] <+Ciphris> which would need a new underwater system
[1:56:53] <BaronVonWolfe> A DARGYN
[1:56:55] <CertainlySyrix> AngriestPat @Kindan55
[1:56:56] <+Ciphris> therefor it's not there
[1:57:06] <%TaifuDragon> HEAL THE DRONE
[1:57:06] <FrostedZaibatsu> Its about to be night time. Better get out of there
[1:57:09] <+Octumn> THE DRONE
[1:57:10] <+Ciphris> squidStar
[1:57:13] <Worldbrand> this is the closest i have ever seen that drone to dying
[1:57:15] <count_bob> I'm pretty sure that's what FF13 was trying to teach us.
[1:57:16] <Volkrotia> Will Pat fall into the Cetus hole? Find out next time!
[1:57:17] <MonsieurHedge> im sure pat is trying his best
[1:57:19] <Zael913> what frame is he using?
[1:57:20] <@PlagueOfGripes> oh boy, vitality
[1:57:25] <Seditary> oberon
[1:57:25] <+FadingEmber> I am starting to think Pat only goes for the big armor characters so he can make more mistakes FailFish
[1:57:25] <fjarcob> Oberon
[1:57:27] <+other_badger> oberon
[1:57:32] <Zael913> Oh, neat
[1:57:32] <reaperx186> the rarest of mods
[1:57:37] <Stol3nheart> Oh man the excals
[1:57:39] <CptHarlok> @FrostedZaibatsu No, Pat should stick around for night-time... hehehe
[1:57:41] <$Bncbck> oh boy
[1:57:41] <$SGrim> Luck pays off again! LUL
[1:57:44] <flying_man_3> amazing, those grineer couldnt kill the drone even with Pat not giving a fuck about it
[1:57:52] <fjarcob> He's using 0 mods on him though
[1:57:53] <+Ciphris> what he get?
[1:57:53] <fruit_pie_the_magician> cast hallowed ground, then stand on it and cast renewal
[1:57:59] <Gorgen> archwing launcher helps
[1:57:59] <Seditary> the plains are pretty, too bad I don't like going there lol
[1:58:03] <Solidus_113> 2.25 KM Squred
[1:58:04] <mcevers> venus is 3x bigger
[1:58:05] <Worldbrand> his oberon's rank 1 folks
[1:58:05] <+dickbuttwoman> It's a low level bounty, it essentially runs itself
[1:58:07] <HorribleHog> FadingEmber They're also among the first ones they give you though, right? probably for that exact reason Jebaited
[1:58:10] <Ralyks_Larettil> @flying_man_3 they can't even on the highest lvl bounty
[1:58:11] <Justafleshwound> anyone know if pat is accepting gifts on warframe?
[1:58:12] <urs0jb> @fruit_pie_the_magician he is lvl 1 xD
[1:58:12] <fjarcob> Zephyr came out a long time ago
[1:58:16] <Stol3nheart> Hey @AngriestPat theres a usable item that lets you use your archwing out on the plans for transport
[1:58:17] <sirrice77> No he isnt
[1:58:20] <CertainlySyrix> He is not @Justafleshwound
[1:58:20] <flying_man_3> Plains is pretty but its one of the worst parts of the game to play long term
[1:58:31] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat radiation causes freindly fire
[1:58:35] <sunny935> just wait till you can fly with your archwing pat
[1:58:38] <CertainlySyrix> I've played Plains for a couple dozen hours and I'm still enjoying it.
[1:58:40] <Justafleshwound> @CertainlySyrix thanks for the heads up
[1:58:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @urs0jb oh, i thought he was leveled. that sucks
[1:58:46] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat rad is good against shields, against corpus
[1:58:58] <Sunstalker> The real monster is the one that craves lootboxes, Pat. Kappa
[1:59:00] <Ralyks_Larettil> @arfsm95 thats not true at all
[1:59:01] <FrostedZaibatsu> Fishing is the best part of Plains
[1:59:03] <mcevers> rad is bad against shields, its good against alloy armor, high level grineer
[1:59:06] <CptHarlok> @flying_man_3 It wouldn't be half bad if I didn't have to fucking haul in 100s of fish for the craftables
[1:59:07] <Ralyks_Larettil> @arfsm95 thats the complete opposite
[1:59:09] <Justafleshwound> I think plains is amazing endgame content, which makes it really weird how early they let you access it
[1:59:10] <%voisraikien> CLEEEEEEEEEEM
[1:59:14] <HorribleHog> There is very little about plains I don't like. It's a good direction imo
[1:59:15] <+FadingEmber> @HorribleHog you have to grind for Rhino but the are other frames with higher dps for less grind
[1:59:17] <TyrantBelial> IT'S NIGHT TIME BABY
[1:59:18] <+Tokanova> does this game have like, rocket launchers?
[1:59:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ded
[1:59:22] <fusioncell12> What MR even is Pat?
[1:59:22] <+Nomicro4u> did you see that head shake
[1:59:28] <Stol3nheart> 6
[1:59:29] <CertainlySyrix> Yes @Tokanova The Ogris.
[1:59:31] <+other_badger> there are a coouple rocket launcher-ish guns
[1:59:32] <deviljhojho94> naisu
[1:59:34] <+Tokanova> neat
[1:59:34] <%SolitaryDrake> What the fuck is even happening
[1:59:38] <Seditary> pat has no vit or shields on his warframe
[1:59:38] <+bustawof> !uptime
[1:59:38] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 59m 47s.
[1:59:40] <Justafleshwound> @Tokanova Several. You want one big rocket? you want a rocket shotgun? rocket machine gun?
[1:59:41] <urs0jb> @Tokanova yes, and granade launchers, laser beams and etc xD
[1:59:43] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:59:45] <HorribleHog> FadingEmber god mode though
[1:59:49] <fazoburquina> I hope pat gets to see an Eidolon, just for the sheer shenanigans potential
[1:59:52] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Poor Rank 2 Obi-Wan
[1:59:53] <flying_man_3> From the looks he posts on twitter if seems like Pat is really rushing frames but not paying much attention to weapons, confirm?
[1:59:55] <+quarkee> oh its hydronot
[1:59:58] <%Cityscape17> how goes the war for frames?
[1:59:58] <+quarkee> bot
[2:00:00] <%deadpalvgz> you can farm gara here
[2:00:01] <CptHarlok> Just realized Pat's running with a completely unmodded frame...
[2:00:02] <$avarice99> This environment is completely different from anything i've seen from warframe
[2:00:02] <+ThePayphone> anyone know when paige gets back? been missing those undertale streams
[2:00:04] <+Tokanova> i was just wondering what youd use to blow up those planes flying around dropping dudes in
[2:00:08] <aeonicvector> @AngriestPat Daytime in the plains is for everyone
[2:00:10] <Worldbrand> It's... got less for noobs
[2:00:13] <+FadingEmber> @HorribleHog okay fine LUL
[2:00:17] <Volkrotia> Its mostly just a side thing
[2:00:17] <CertainlySyrix> She's been a bit burdened with work lately apparently @ThePayphone
[2:00:22] <Volkrotia> More a chill place than anything
[2:00:29] <OmegaTrigun> afaik no its not really for noobs
[2:00:31] <+Ciphris> anything past level 100 gets ridiculous and they say it's like that by design
[2:00:37] <+ajcritfumble> lets jsut say theres different stuff for vets... spoilery stuff
[2:00:38] <aeonicvector> also, dont forget your not rhino anymore, you take more damage
[2:00:42] <$serpenttucker> @AngriestPat The real endgame is the missions that feature enemies level 50+
[2:00:44] <+bladermage> Does the dex sybaris drop off after jupiter?
[2:00:46] <Flamecap1> UI glitch I believe
[2:00:46] <+DontMindMee> @AngriestPat You forgot to put on mods
[2:00:47] <OmegaTrigun> which is an odd design choice to allow low lvl players into an area that is pretty irrelevant to them
[2:00:48] <Gorgen> good ol buggy plains
[2:00:48] <ck1755> you should try fishing pat
[2:00:53] <Worldbrand> yeyeyeye cast grass
[2:00:53] <+ThePayphone> @CertainlySyrix yeah i saw from twitter that she's been traveling a bunch so it might be a bit
[2:00:54] <CertainlySyrix> Some useful stuff drops from Bounties for new players
[2:00:55] <+Proposition__Joe> the game talked about the in the kotor lp
[2:00:56] <%YabbaTroll> hey why is the time not going down?
[2:01:01] <flying_man_3> Welcome to the Bounty Sytem
[2:01:02] <+CruelOak> playing the plains on a lvl 1 frame is a bit risky
[2:01:03] <FrostedZaibatsu> Snipers shoot to kill. No Hollywood miss you the first time bs
[2:01:03] <Justafleshwound> well you can scale with the crazy enemy scaling.with the right build you can still oneshot level 100+ enemies
[2:01:10] <Solidus_113> AOE Rad damage
[2:01:12] <CptHarlok> @bladermage Nope, it's a limited time alert, there's probably still some times left to get it.
[2:01:13] <Gorgen> yes you plant grass
[2:01:13] <aeonicvector> pat its a damage field that also gives you armor when used with 3
[2:01:15] <flying_man_3> its full of glitches that waste your time
[2:01:16] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> yes
[2:01:17] <Ralyks_Larettil> @YabbaTroll the game has some really bad UI bugs going around
[2:01:19] <+dickbuttwoman> GRASS BOIS
[2:01:19] <+crocnor> that is your little garden
[2:01:19] <Rentixx> Behold, you're now a farmer making grass

[2:04:19] <fusioncell12> @AngriestPat when in archwing

[2:05:12] <fusioncell12> @AngriestPat you need the archwing launcher from Clan research to use it in plains
[2:05:13] <Ralyks_Larettil> the archwing on the plains controls different from normal archwing. much worse actually

[2:05:16] <%SickBangerzM9> Pat is becoming Paige
[2:05:17] <+Dasbubba> @AngriestPat You should use some of that ostron standing you earned from the bounty to buy a fishing spear and mining drill as well

[2:06:07] <Oak_bogle> @angriestpat yeah. Going out for years. Get married already KappaRoss

[2:06:08] <Stol3nheart> You can extract by yourself
[2:06:09] <Solidus_113> there's a 50 second timer
[2:06:09] <Daniel_Is_I> @AngriestPat That used to be a problem, now you can leave.
[2:06:11] <Alef321> @AngriestPat you can crouch while aiming to extend the speed and not break your legs
[2:06:11] <AtlasMcCoy> Thats why theres a timer
[2:06:11] <%deadpalvgz> @AngriestPat you can just leave squad and it'll put you in your own instance without loss of loot and then you can leave on your own
[2:06:15] <fusioncell12> @AngriestPat you can abort mission/leave squad to return
[2:06:16] <+AcidicHorizon> You can leave without the rest of the party
[2:06:16] <+OranHexthief> you can leave squad without leaving mission pat
[2:06:17] <aeonicvector> you can also solo extract nowadays
[2:06:19] <Justafleshwound> @AngriestPat it used to be like that. they patched it so you don't have to wait for everyone
[2:06:20] <+Octumn> You can leave by yourself
[2:06:23] <flying_man_3> theres solo extract now but there wasnt at the start
[2:06:24] <Worldbrand> On the plains you have the option to leave squad without leaving the mission

[2:07:42] <+Dasbubba> @AngriestPat Should pick up a fishing spear and mining drill from the fishing and mining vendors in town once you got a little bit of standing from those bounties you did. It's needed to craft Gara and a few other Plains of Eidolon gear.

[2:09:14] <Akaisuki> Destiny completely squanders the potential of the setting
[2:09:18] <Stol3nheart> @Quack_of_Dawn I think its just because of plague talking about it

[2:09:29] <+lupomancer> SourPls
[2:09:29] <+GreenBrains_> sbfpPat Poop Break sbfpRichard
[2:09:32] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Yeah but Destiny had Nathan Fillion tho :^)
[2:09:32] <CertainlySyrix> channeling @TheButtravage
[2:09:33] <fjarcob> Is this Pat's first Frame bp quest?
[2:09:38] <Caivyre> jerk off break
[2:09:38] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @fusioncell12 he better
[2:09:40] <Mofirelizard> Pat's pooping
[2:09:42] <+other_badger> leftclick with melee uses energy to attack and block better
[2:09:45] <OkamiDude15> SourPls SourPls
[2:09:54] <TheButtravage> @CertainlySyrix Ah. What does channeling do?
[2:10:02] <dissmech> @thebuttravage it channels your energy pool into your melee attacks and blocks
[2:10:02] <Cobaltor_252> quick talk shit while he's gone
[2:10:04] <Mofirelizard> xxjak21xxLove
[2:10:09] <Everpresent_Overseer> Too bad Pat didn't get the chance to steal a Dargyn in the plains
[2:10:12] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Pat smells
[2:10:12] <CertainlySyrix> @TheButtravage Increases the damage of the weapon at the cost of energy. Not worth it unless you have Life Strike.
[2:10:23] <NemokillerV> @thebuttravage it activates channelling which uses energy to make your attacks and blocks stronger
[2:10:25] <TheButtravage> Thanks.
[2:10:35] <+bustawof> btw does anybody knows a good spy mission to farm ivara because have I been unlucky
[2:10:39] <fusioncell12> I sure hope he likes Valkyr's... assets
[2:10:41] <CrimsonSkeletons> I drew a picture of Pat pooping, there's stink lines and everything.
[2:10:45] <OkamiDude15> pat is a cool guy Kappa
[2:10:48] <SpinnySpinda> Nice
[2:10:58] <Superstrata> what song is this? i really dig it
[2:11:01] <CertainlySyrix> @bustawof I know the Spy mission on Lua is best for a specific one. Let me look up the others real quick.
[2:11:03] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Who are you, IndonesianBob?
[2:11:10] <fjarcob> Ivara's parts each drop from different planets
[2:11:11] <TheRealJerryMcGhoulBerry> Fuck this music is so good. Fuck I need to play Persona.
[2:11:13] <+bustawof> @certainlysyrix thank you
[2:11:15] <fazoburquina> @CertainlySyrix it's kinda worth it if you have both of Zenurik's passives maxed out and a frame with Rage but otherwise, yeah, channeling with melee weapons is very really worth it outside of Life Strike
[2:11:16] <%Multiblacksteel> @Superstrata persona 5
[2:11:24] <Caidezes> It took Pat sixty hours to get to the Saya's Sigil quest. He's gonna be playing this game for years at this rate.
[2:11:28] <Justafleshwound> @bustawof you should look at the wiki because each piece of ivara comes from different tier spy missions
[2:11:29] <OkamiDude15> @Superstrata beneath the mask rain version from persona 5
[2:11:29] <TheButtravage> I just got the first set of weapons to rank 30, I guess I'll switch to the Dex weapons.
[2:11:34] <fazoburquina> really noy worth it*

[2:19:18] <AbnormalEnd> hah
[2:19:19] <Finaldragoon> GOTEM
[2:19:21] <$RaikenTB> show them the crowbcat video
[2:19:23] <+Ciphris> muhXD
[2:19:26] <Caidezes> Damn.
[2:19:30] <Gorgen> more like Puddle of Thieves.
[2:19:31] <pennykettle_> PogChamp
[2:19:32] <Katalist_> let it all out
[2:19:33] <NemokillerV> incoming rant
[2:19:35] <Worldbrand> i'm buckling in
[2:19:37] <+NiktenKing> LONG AND BIG PAT
[2:19:37] <OmegaTrigun> DO IT
[2:19:59] <HorribleHog> like counter-strike
[2:20:08] <Finaldragoon> so Guild Wars 2
[2:20:09] <%maskedriderhero> Puzzle Pirates has more content than Sea of Thieves
[2:20:17] <RioGascar> But counter strike has options and the better guns cost $$$
[2:20:50] <+TsunamiPoro> big rants for big boys
[2:21:20] <HorribleHog> why the fuck is MS putting a 70€ price tag on an early access title?
[2:21:22] <+Camail> Sea of thieves got me back into puzzle pirates, I lost my legendary rank, got sad, then quit again
[2:21:52] <RioGascar> I wouldnt call it early access, its highly polished. But it seems the lack of content is more coming from oversights
[2:21:56] <deviljhojho94> qwuickildy
[2:22:03] <+TheLordOfHats> Like different squads in Into the Breach
[2:22:05] <Zombrocom> Except Forma though
[2:22:10] <@thenefftw> Forma, Pat
[2:22:19] <Worldbrand> There are even different versions of the same weapon that are sidegrades to each other, but superior ot the original
[2:22:19] <Parapattern> Elmo
[2:22:20] <+NiktenKing> Staircase progression?
[2:22:23] <%ssaryn> So what we're all thinking... is Sea of Thieves is a bad version of what everyone wants out of a "Lifestyle Game" because there's NOTHING THERE.
[2:22:38] <RioGascar> like one EXTREMELY big oversight for sea of thieves IS THAT PC PLAYERS and xbox players can play together and there is 0 DIFFERENCE IN AIMING so pc players stomp them every time
[2:22:40] <fjarcob> he probably hasnt seen forma yet
[2:22:40] <bleugh> this rant is making elmo agitated
[2:22:51] <MONSTRx_x> but the mod grind
[2:22:56] <+bustawof> Oh boi the forma
[2:22:58] <pennykettle_> I cant believe its fucking $60
[2:23:00] <%maskedriderhero> Sea of Thieves is "Do the exact same thing a dozen times for a new pair of pants"
[2:23:01] <+Camail> the population density isn't high enough to make PvP interesting
[2:23:01] <MarylandJutsu> small like ELMO
[2:23:05] <+dickbuttwoman> Paging Forma Addict
[2:23:08] <anon_1307> forma
[2:23:12] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> u do good patty
[2:23:17] <AbnormalEnd> i hear from people that the beta essentially made a lot of people not buy the game because it was pretty much the same.
[2:23:33] <$Quack_of_Dawn> Sea of thieves is a game where they ask you to make your own fun and assign your own value to rewards for sixty dollars
[2:23:34] <%finaltrinity5> Is Pat ranting about progression in video games?
[2:23:34] <reonome> it means the devs were lazy
[2:23:39] <HorribleHog> is it just to goad people into subscribing to their games as service thing?
[2:23:39] <+oatmealthicc> what bout overwatch
[2:23:40] <pennykettle_> You can swim, you can shoot, uh, cannons, sharks @AngriestPat
[2:23:46] <$HowIPendragon> U mean MATT? Lol
[2:23:48] <drakthebest> Skill based progression can potentially feel really good though
[2:23:49] <%ssaryn> If Sea of Thieves was like... $30.... I think people would have forgave it... but RARE made it and Microsoft was like YEYEYE GO BUY IT, and we all then were like... Fuck.
[2:23:53] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat That was an excellent explanation! Thank you!
[2:23:55] <Akacidx> So sea of Theives is the New No mans Sky
[2:23:59] <Belutima> Max is streaming, Sea of Thieves RIGHT NOW doodRage so there you have that
[2:24:03] <RioGascar> Lateral progression isnt bad, WHEN THERES ENOUGH content. But there just isnt
[2:24:04] <drakthebest> But you need Gameplay good enough to support it
[2:24:06] <Solidus_113> No Man's Sea Kappa
[2:24:07] <+dickbuttwoman> Pirates vs. Ninjas
[2:24:08] <+d00msdaydan> pirates vs robot ninjas
[2:24:15] <%Kingkaiju0618> @angriestpat but what about omnidirectional progression?
[2:24:17] <%finaltrinity5> Sea of thieves is $60? I've missed somehow all news of this
[2:24:20] <+seriousink> there is a pirate warframe!
[2:24:20] <UvBenServed> Everyone play Hydroid with Zarrs
[2:24:20] <+bobfriskit> honestly it looks like it has less content than Destiny2
[2:24:22] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> No but Hydroid can be a pirate tho
[2:24:23] <%ssaryn> TIME TO SEE DISAPPOINTMENT LIVE
[2:24:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> hydroid prime is pirate themed
[2:24:23] <fusioncell12> Warframe does have a pirate warframe
[2:24:24] <$Quack_of_Dawn> I'd put sea of thieves above No Man's Sky
[2:24:25] <$RaikenTB> it's streamer trash
[2:24:26] <ghostcarnival> Koudelka is a pretty amazing game, I know thats not related to the topic, but I keep hearing that name. At least I think I do
[2:24:27] <%finaltrinity5> Multitrack progression
[2:24:28] <%maskedriderhero> @Quack_of_Dawn The problem with that is, while it's a nice concept to present, if you want your players to make their own fun you gotta give them a lot of toys to play with
[2:24:29] <Spydurman> LUL
[2:24:40] <$Quack_of_Dawn> Yeah it's an issue
[2:24:41] <NemokillerV> @finaltrinity5 he's ranting sea of thieve's progression compared to warframe
[2:24:41] <%ssaryn> GoW3 is actually good but wow is Kratos a piece of shit.
[2:24:43] <fjarcob> space scurvy
[2:24:59] <Everpresent_Overseer> Old timey Pirates vs Future Tech Ninjas
[2:25:00] <HypeArbalest> crazy
[2:25:00] <Caidezes> Caim is a monster.
[2:25:05] <AbnormalEnd> Caim is the best
[2:25:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hes super evil
[2:25:06] <+Bloodxb> boy is he
[2:25:10] <KaiserMario> Indigo Prophecy? heh
[2:25:14] <+oatmealthicc> dark souls maybe?
[2:25:16] <%DraxTD> Sea of thiefs is your and Matt's fault, @AngriestPat, for singing your theam on AC black flag years ago
[2:25:17] <Caivyre> Caim is the EVILEST
[2:25:22] <+magikestral> @angriestpat Yoko taro is very open about how much he made caim hateable
[2:25:24] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> Guts isn't evil?
[2:25:24] <%DraxTD> you hyped up the pieret life
[2:25:25] <+ajcritfumble> and guts walks a line at that
[2:25:25] <%ssaryn> Caim cares for nobody other than Furiae and other than that, IS A FUCKING MONSTER.
[2:25:27] <reonome> M U R D E R
[2:25:27] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> since when?
[2:25:28] <fairore> whoa caim ?
[2:25:31] <%Macbutters86> Poor Papa nier
[2:25:31] <%maskedriderhero> Caim is Kratos, but more entertaining
[2:25:32] <+BoSteed> One could argue Shadow of the Colossus
[2:25:34] <ArcanumMBD> But Guts is evil. Griffith did nothing wrong
[2:25:35] <AbnormalEnd> what if guts didnt have demon's to slay
[2:25:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> that part where he used that lady to jam that gear for no reason and then later sees a teenage girl and is like "THAT REMINDS ME OF MY DAUGHTER MAMORU"
[2:25:46] <+SaurianCrash> Ever Seen Radius its like a real David age Movie
[2:25:48] <Sulliman34> guts is chaotic neutral
[2:25:48] <%commanderclaw> Every time he says Harrow I'm reminded of Haro from Gundam
[2:25:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> NO HES A GOOD BOY
[2:25:52] <nemasis_gamer> Oh man, I'm so nervous for the next chapter of Berserk
[2:25:52] <%ssaryn> Guts is Chaotic Neutral.
[2:25:52] <+ajcritfumble> wrathful
[2:25:52] <+greyfox747> !uptime
[2:25:53] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 26m 1s.
[2:25:54] <laguerrilha> Neutral good
[2:25:55] <%Macbutters86> CHaotic Neutral?
[2:25:56] <Bouldus> chaotic neutral
[2:25:57] <Caivyre> Caim is very likable because every other character in that game sucks, but he is super evil
[2:25:57] <YautjaBorne> Chaotic neutral
[2:25:58] <%Mdub98> Guts is Chatoic Good
[2:25:58] <+AXL808> an ass
[2:26:02] <Parapattern> "Problematic"
[2:26:05] <@thenefftw> Chaotic Neutral
[2:26:06] <deviljhojho94> ass
[2:26:06] <Worldbrand> neutral bastard
[2:26:07] <+seriousink> Guts isn't nice, but I don't think he's evil
[2:26:08] <+SaurianCrash> David Cage*
[2:26:09] <+Sir_Lune> Guts is the result of a perpetually bad day
[2:26:10] <%MisterCrimson> Guts is playing by the rules the demons lay out
[2:26:17] <$Quack_of_Dawn> good doesn't mean nice
[2:26:19] <AbnormalEnd> you could say Guts tends to go
[2:26:20] <%maskedriderhero> Guts is not a good person, but he is far from evil
[2:26:20] <AbnormalEnd> berserk
[2:26:22] <xanerts> guts is a anti hero
[2:26:23] <HorribleHog> Chaotic neutral is insanity, Chaotic Good is Guts all over
[2:26:23] <%ssaryn> Same with Caim too actually, Chaotic Neutral.
[2:26:23] <%lupomancer> Nathan for You is a great example of the camera telling you this guy is goodd but the situation is telling you he's evil. Think you talked about it on the podcast
[2:26:24] <NemokillerV> Chaotic Good/Nuetral
[2:26:29] <Shaggnar> It's called temporary psychopathy. You're a great guy until someone pushes you too far
[2:26:30] <PowerArmorMeow> Guts is complicated.
[2:26:30] <nemasis_gamer> Guts is a survivor
[2:26:33] <Divryne> Ayy.
[2:26:33] <%Macbutters86> Caim is chaotic crazy
[2:26:37] <HypeArbalest> Guts is an old crazy little child
[2:26:39] <+ajcritfumble> ew no chaotic neutral characters fucking suck and so does the alignment system in dnd - a bored and angry gm
[2:26:40] <Twoiis> Wow alert app
[2:26:42] <PowerArmorMeow> Caim?
[2:26:46] <HowlingSamurai> A Way Out
[2:26:48] <Sunstalker> Kratos wasn't raised like a normal person either. He was child soldier since birth.
[2:26:52] <%ssaryn> He got money out of his crazy tho.
[2:26:54] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Guts does good things by accident while smashing everything he wants
[2:26:56] <%maskedriderhero> Guts is a pragmatic person who won't hesitate to lie, cheat and steal to survive, but he won't just murder an innocent person for shits and giggles
[2:27:07] <pennykettle_> We can all blame fucking Plague for this new crack addiction
[2:27:07] <PowerArmorMeow> ^^^
[2:27:12] <reonome> pat the crack peddler
[2:27:13] <+seriousink> I am... way way more than 5 days in...
[2:27:24] <Graywolf_the_45th> I think one character in Drakengard litrally calls Caim the perfect balance between good and evil
[2:27:24] <+AXL808> First hit is free guys
[2:27:31] <HorribleHog> ajcritfumble It only sucks if alignment doesn't rapidly change depending on character development
[2:27:32] <%ssaryn> @maskedriderhero Yeeeeee that's pretty on point.
[2:27:34] <hntronium> Plauge is BetterPat
[2:27:36] <Sulliman34> yknow before that stream announcement i didnt think plague would be as handsome as he is
[2:27:37] <%deadpalvgz> yes
[2:27:37] <+NiktenKing> "smart"
[2:27:37] <ryu1299> going back warframe because of you and for some reason I've got frost prime???
[2:27:38] <Ariksgabs> Warframe pulled me out of MHW, which is surprising
[2:27:39] <ArcanumMBD> I just booted up Warframe for the first time in 2 years (I have 200 hours in it already) and man I am so fucking lost
[2:27:39] <+dickbuttwoman> I am glad I got in RIGHT before the groundswell burst the damn
[2:27:43] <+didyouthinkofthis> yes
[2:27:46] <+NiktenKing> TRAPMASTER
[2:27:46] <Sulliman34> chroma has the worst buildpath
[2:27:46] <Aleate> yes
[2:27:46] <Worldbrand> Yes
[2:27:47] <+ajcritfumble> 9k oxium
[2:27:49] <+dickbuttwoman> 20 nitains 7k oxium
[2:27:49] <bwong1231> yes
[2:27:51] <%ssaryn> Vauban Prime is easily the worst.
[2:27:52] <+AXL808> alert missions
[2:27:52] <+Bloodxb> h r ll years it is
[2:27:53] <PowerArmorMeow> I've been in Warframe for a year and I now have all frames and I'm only missing 1 prime warframe
[2:27:54] <+NiktenKing> OXIUM
[2:27:54] <Gorgen> all the oxium
[2:27:55] <aeonicvector> YUP
[2:27:55] <Mr_Bumble_Bee> You need a crap ton of nitains for it
[2:27:55] <fusioncell12> @AngriestPat 7000 oxium
[2:27:55] <bwong1231> you also need 4k cryo
[2:27:57] <$KwakuAnansi> Yep
[2:27:57] <+NiktenKing> FUCK THAT
[2:27:57] <Worldbrand> 7000 oxium and 9000 cryotic
[2:27:59] <HorribleHog> ajcritfumble maybe, I don't know what i'm talking about, i'm just speaking from the heart
[2:28:01] <%maskedriderhero> Not to mention, ever since Guts has gotten his traveling party he has become a lot nicer in many ways, and is more just a grim heroic individual
[2:28:02] <+Xarathustra> cauban prime almost made me cry
[2:28:02] <+bustawof> Vauban? u mean all your shit prime
[2:28:04] <Thesaltymixture> Nitain and oxium. The horror
[2:28:07] <+Ciphris> vauban prime x.x
[2:28:07] <Daniel_Is_I> Thanks to the twitch promo DE was running for Plains of Eidolon, I got 120+ nitain for free
[2:28:09] <%InkblotBlues> Yeah but his vacuum grenades are fun
[2:28:13] <tUxUt> i just finished leveling vauban base, i hate him
[2:28:15] <sunny935> he is vaulted now
[2:28:15] <+dickbuttwoman> Vauban Prime is a big boy, with BIG poise, and makes anything with infested a joke.
[2:28:20] <Everpresent_Overseer> Hey Pat want a free Vauvan Prime set?
[2:28:22] <%ssaryn> FREE MONEY PAT
[2:28:22] <+AXL808> Some frames are just worth paying the frame direct instead of building
[2:28:23] <+seriousink> Vauban Prime used to be like, 32k oxium on launch. it was ludicrous.
[2:28:24] <@thenefftw> DO IT
[2:28:27] <@thenefftw> BUY
[2:28:31] <pennykettle_> We are killing Pat
[2:28:32] <Solidus_113> HE'S DOING IT AGAIN
[2:28:32] <+NekoNinja13> prime frames are purely cosmetic correct?
[2:28:33] <Deceased_ninja> easyer to just get vauban prime :P
[2:28:33] <LixFury> OH OH
[2:28:35] <Warfey> NotLikeThis
[2:28:35] <$Quack_of_Dawn> Do I wait for paige to stream and get the prime resub or do I just use it now
[2:28:36] <%ssaryn> MORE MATH FOR MORE FREE MONEY

[2:28:37] <HorribleHog> vauban (puke)
[2:28:38] <+HelloImTom08> no, nothing was worse that equanox farm and getting 14 pieces to drop
[2:28:42] <urs0jb> vauban prime is awesome
[2:28:44] <+Ciphris> didn't vauban prime get axed

[2:30:05] <+dickbuttwoman> @bustawof it's not that bad. At least the boss fight is fun.
[2:30:06] <+ajcritfumble> @HorribleHog dont tell me your characters an edgy boring "chaotic neutral" stryder type who says nothing all game and kills shit with 2 swords SHOW me thats what they are if youre playing that straight or SHOW me the interesting spin on it. its why i play dungeon world over DND bonds and activity based allignment is so much better than the nebulous "act in this way i guess idk" dnd version
[2:30:13] <MadOx__> Plauge of War on the subreddit
[2:30:16] <kazhiim> did anybody tell pat about (big) bo prime

[2:30:21] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> u ok

[2:30:24] <%ssaryn> @Kingkaiju0618 YEYE FUND CRACK ADDICTION

[2:30:50] <laguerrilha> YEAHHH
[2:30:53] <@thenefftw> It looks cool
[2:30:53] <%finaltrinity5> YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST, LP CONFIRMED
[2:30:59] <CertainlySyrix> hit more buttons
[2:30:59] <Seditary> what happened to my chat
[2:30:59] <pennykettle_> @Kingkaiju0618 thats like giving a hobo money with "buy alcohol" written on it, you are killing this man
[2:31:01] <+bustawof> ya atleast regenald is fun to fight
[2:31:06] <%ssaryn> Yeah that's accurate.
[2:31:07] <RioGascar> I think it would be more a one off
[2:31:12] <Caidezes> God of War 2 is the best one though.
[2:31:20] <fruit_pie_the_magician> i got all the equi pieces really fast, but I still haven't gotten the ivara blueprint after years, i think
[2:31:29] <%ssaryn> And then like an hour into GoW2.
[2:31:31] <+magikestral> ghost of sparta is the best
[2:31:35] <fusioncell12> So is this a break or the end of the stream?
[2:31:41] <pennykettle_> @fusioncell12 break
[2:31:50] <RioGascar> I probably wont be able to gow1 since i played lots more games that were inspired by gow will i chat???
[2:31:56] <fusioncell12> @pennykettle_ I figured but still had to check
[2:31:57] <%ssaryn> Gameplay wise tho... GoW2 is still fucking awesome.
[2:32:03] <TyrantBelial> What were said story problems.
[2:32:05] <+JavaManJoJo> Hi everyone
[2:32:08] <%Macbutters86> God of War 2 but shits the bed with the story
[2:32:15] <Aleate> Does anyone know how I might be able to get into the SBFP clan on Warframe? :)
[2:32:21] <RioGascar> I can put myself in the era of when _ game came out, but design elements are much harder to seperate myself from
[2:32:26] <Warfey> oh my god WHAT
[2:32:26] <reonome> why
[2:32:30] <@thenefftw> Oh no
[2:32:32] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wat
[2:32:33] <+boredpantz> yeah guys how to we get into the SBFP clan
[2:32:36] <laguerrilha> thats awful!
[2:32:36] <faegbeard> That sounds like a dumb Jaffe thing to do.
[2:32:46] <YautjaBorne> New one looks good tho
[2:32:46] <sunny935> gameplay wise 3 is fun with the weapons other than the blades and each having their own magic
[2:32:51] <Sunstalker> faegbeard jaffe was the frist game
[2:32:55] <fruit_pie_the_magician> GOW3 had three chain weapons which all functioned the same :/
[2:33:06] <+SleazyShell> More like David Gaffe-y Kappa
[2:33:15] <%ssaryn> Yeah they did. GoW3 still had it but a lot of other stuff had a lot more going on.
[2:33:19] <Piemen99> sounds like D2
[2:33:21] <pennykettle_> Thats actively ruining your game, straight up
[2:33:22] <+Cyoctane> But you dont have to do that combo...

[2:34:16] <+dickbuttwoman> @bustawof I just did as well
[2:34:16] <TyrantBelial> I've, always told people Warframe is a crack game, like MonHun
[2:34:18] <RioGascar> Its the theory of “best move with least difficulty needed” i forget the term but its a fairly tough game design issue to solve
[2:34:19] <+gwanzan2> having a beefy new pc and playing games you used to not be able to is one of life's finest pleasures
[2:34:27] <%ssaryn> DO IT.
[2:34:30] <bleugh> does this game have any draw if i don't care about grinding

[2:36:59] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> I want Detroit to actually be good
[2:37:02] <$BouyantSoul> Square Farm Animal Pat art incoming
[2:37:07] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> but you apparently get to play as a short haired woman

[2:37:12] <Worldbrand> Inaros is a questframe yeah
[2:37:13] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> yes
[2:37:13] <@thenefftw> Inaros is a quest
[2:37:14] <Justafleshwound> It's a quest you have to buy
[2:37:14] <+didyouthinkofthis> yes
[2:37:15] <+AXL808> quest frame
[2:37:15] <+dickbuttwoman> Just do the quest
[2:37:16] <HypeArbalest> yes
[2:37:17] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> so we'll have to deal with even more rape scenes
[2:37:19] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Every bit you donate makes Pat grow in size and anger.
[2:37:19] <AbnormalEnd> inaros's quest is great
[2:37:20] <%ssaryn> Inaros is indeed a quest. Inaros is perfectly fine to farm.
[2:37:21] <MadOx__> you have to get inaros from Baro but you cant get to Pluto yet
[2:37:21] <deanbees> Yes. He is a quest.
[2:37:24] <Everpresent_Overseer> yes
[2:37:26] <%InkblotBlues> The Inaros quest is awesome
[2:37:26] <aeonicvector> inaros is a quest, but NOT a riven age quest
[2:37:26] <flying_man_3> DO NOT buy frames or weapons
[2:37:29] <+AXL808> he doesn't have ducats though
[2:37:30] <Worldbrand> The riven thing is only for like, two of them
[2:37:30] <%YabbaTroll> cant he be taxied?
[2:37:31] <reonome> LUL

[2:37:41] <+Cyoctane> How much to donate for you guys to give Detroit a fair chance? Its not fun to watch when you guys expect to hate it and shit on it
[2:37:42] <Everpresent_Overseer> You can buy his quest right now from Baro kiteer
[2:37:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You must see the best skins, check out all the deluxes
[2:37:46] <%MisterCrimson> If Detroit isn't a shit fest, I'll be pissed. That would imply that David Cage is capable of making a good game but has deliberately not done so.
[2:37:46] <HentaiSpyder> growing strong not HUGE
[2:37:47] <%finaltrinity5> wait, it did?
[2:37:52] <%finaltrinity5> What happened with Destiny 2?
[2:37:52] <Ariksgabs> Can the robots in Detroit be considered Frames?
[2:37:52] <+ArcticAsylum> Honest question: Should we want Detroit to be good so David Cage can show he can make something worth a shit...or do we want the shit fest?
[2:37:56] <Cobaltor_252> DO THE QUEST
[2:37:59] <+dickbuttwoman> @flying_man_3 Eh. After farming ALL the frames myself... buy mesa/atlas/trinity
[2:38:01] <mr_gentleman96> @finaltrinity5 Its a joke
[2:38:03] <Superstrata> it hasn't fully done it yet
[2:38:03] <MadOx__> @fruit_pie_the_magician he needs MR9 to get to pluto i thin
[2:38:05] <+LogothX> Destiny 2 went the way Lawbreakers

[2:38:25] <HorribleHog> And way earlier than Destiny
[2:38:25] <flying_man_3> I too have farmed many frames. but the market is still a rip off
[2:38:28] <Seditary> either works tbh @ArcticAsylum

[2:38:52] <$magikestral> @angriestpat I sent prematurely, whoops
[2:38:52] <+Tokanova> holy crap i didn't realize you could backattack people
[2:39:01] <+crimsonharvest> The only thing that Destiny 2 has over Warframe is Lance Reddick voice acting.
[2:39:02] <+dickbuttwoman> IT'S FREE MONEY. YOU GOTTA BRING YOUR OWN WALLET BUT THE MONEY IS FREE.
[2:39:03] <+ArcticAsylum> @magikestral FAIR

[3:21:02] <sunriser696> Crazy Talk is in full effect tonight
[3:21:10] <yodajr99> you should be flagged for abuse making us watch those terrible skills

[3:21:25] <miguelrod777> I'm excited for the podcast
[3:21:26] <%SleazyShell> yo I didn't notice before now that the muzzle flash on the Dex Sybaris is the lotus symbol, that's neat
[3:21:43] <T3chn0mancy> howd o you miss B so hard?
[3:21:43] <KTDelgado> longer channe = more energy per kill
[3:21:44] <+CaptainObnoxious> why did you go towards C. B would've been closer
[3:21:47] <%ssjklyco> @sunriser696 Crazy Talk Requiem: It's Free Money
[3:21:49] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> God harrow is so shit unranked.I'm so used to gettting like 200 energy for like one headshot
[3:21:50] <%ssaryn> I feel so fucking betrayed right now..
[3:21:50] <TezarroEX> I wonder if woolie has even made an account yet
[3:21:58] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> unmodded i mean
[3:22:06] <@thenefftw> Just like Free Money
[3:22:07] <+Poseidon2462> pat on controller or keyboard?
[3:22:09] <Zombrocom> Free energy!
[3:22:12] <Giothegame> Is Nekros good in this game now?
[3:22:12] <+spacecowboy3825> Did pat pay real money for e-garbo again?
[3:22:15] <%Cyoctane> pssst... its free energy
[3:22:17] <%asterioth> charge it for more, headshots also give 3x energy
[3:22:21] <mr_slaide> It's a victimless crime, like punching someone in the dark!
[3:22:23] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> @Giothegame ye
[3:22:40] <+TeethMuncher> @incarnate3825 he also forgot we could see the screen and Paige was in chat
[3:22:41] <MC_GigglePants> Free energy! Free money! Is there anything in this game that isn't free?
[3:22:42] <NemokillerV> @angriestpat do you know how his 2nd ability works though?
[3:22:42] <sunriser696> Pat paid free monwy to make more money
[3:22:43] <KTDelgado> CHARGE IT LONGER FOR MORE ENERGY PER KILL
[3:22:43] <+naddykack> Why is he using the heat sword, it's utter Bantha fodder
[3:22:50] <Everpresent_Overseer> Now use that free energy to buy Space scarfs
[3:22:53] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> Harrow's powers also effect the entire party
[3:22:58] <+AJ_Cherenkov> heat sord... is free with code
[3:23:01] <Giothegame> Cool! @LORDSPOOKLEKINS
[3:23:07] <urs0jb> don't use loud weapons inside the vault, you will alert enemies '-'
[3:23:10] <Maverick2736> Harrow does show most of what he can really do only once you have a fully complete build on him. He's complicated to build and use, but pays off greatly
[3:23:12] <fusioncell12> The right path in this room is faster
[3:23:14] <fusioncell12> and safer
[3:23:16] <+spacecowboy3825> @TeethMuncher Good I wouldn't have it any other way.
[3:23:18] <ratfacegonzalez> pat you will not get a return off that plat, the market is crashing
[3:23:20] <Worldbrand> The more energy you feed into 3, the more you get back!
[3:23:22] <fusioncell12> IMO anyway
[3:23:24] <$FilthyHippie> Hey pat i dropped off since when you first had interest in this game from the podcast and now, are you fully "in" on this ?
[3:23:54] <ratfacegonzalez> he spent 100 buckaroos on plat

[3:28:50] <%ssaryn> @CarditoSoRico Ultra Warframe Kappa
[3:28:52] <KTDelgado> you only get aura mods from alerts

[3:29:43] <Justafleshwound> He was pretending you weren't there in hopes you ran past
[3:29:44] <@thenefftw> @AngriestPat When you use Forma on your shit, sometimes you need to use unranked mods
[3:29:44] <Shadowspartan110> pat doesnt ask us a lot of questions that are important in the clan
[3:29:48] <Rivalshotzgp> Buy a aura in trade chat, energy siphon and corrosive projection. They’re cheap and gained from rare alerts
[3:30:04] <+ArcticAsylum> You can't be loud if they're dead
[3:30:04] <KTDelgado> get stuff from you cl
[3:30:09] <PGSplays> might not have been stealthy but it waw cool as fuuuuuck
