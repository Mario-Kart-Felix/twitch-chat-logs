[0:26:05] <%bread_assassin> Note: The glow in the dark cats was a side effect of scientists trying to find a cure for cat AIDs.
[0:26:06] <%Kataguro> Pat, you fist fight a big monster in a smelter. Jake is cool
[0:26:07] <%marsantas> For us? YES

[0:26:12] <%MSN04_Sazabi> The only reason people obsess over Pierce is because they want Chris to finally fuck someone, anyone
[0:26:15] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Piers or Pierce, that's how memorable he is
[0:26:17] <%michingmallecho> Is it time?🌝
[0:26:18] <%sadorno69> If you drink enough red bull you won't have to play re6
[0:26:18] <%Erimos> Jake gets terrible levels but the best melee system.

[0:26:32] <%RealThiele> you gotta wait to pop your follow cherry
[0:26:39] <biomegabear> @PatStaresAt could you imagine if RE6 got the RE2 remake treatment and be just a different game?

[0:48:13] <boogaleeboo> Seriously Chris is Big McPunchhuge but Leon is a fucking loony toon
[0:48:14] <+MrAtheGreat> Nothibg’s quite qs scary as seeing the word CHECKPOINT in bright bold letters.
[0:48:14] <mannywatcha> They should both have broken legs. Okay Leon is tough as shit but Helena is a basic bitch and should have a bunch o shattered bone.

[0:50:26] <+Ckarasu> If this was just the Leon campaign with a bit more polish, the game might have been pretty good.
[0:50:27] <%Rmxgirl> did the people who make this forget that umbrella is gone before this point in the series? or did they just say fuck it and bring them back?

[0:51:47] <+MrAtheGreat> They touted it as each campaign having a “different kind of horror,” with Leon’s being the “traditional” kind. You may now laugh after seeing Leon’s “traditional horror” prologue just now.

[0:54:44] <dirtsnake01> to be fair he did not know any of them
[0:54:44] <+Toblo1> @PatStaresAt To be fair, he didn't know them very long
[0:54:44] <+senfood> It's because that zombie was the President and he's Secret Service.

[0:55:14] <NaturalGear> yes :)
[0:55:15] <C24U> Leon canonically never even met Marvin in the old lore
[0:55:15] <AnacondaVirtue> That was the WORST way to phrase that
[0:55:16] <%tank7013> Why would you lead like that LEON
[0:55:16] <%professormorrigan> I...... SHOT HTE PRESIDENT
[0:55:16] <DazedCookies> this devil may cry game sure is weird

[0:55:27] <trianglehat> I would vote for zombie president
[0:55:28] <%studleydoorite> I shot the president... and I'D DO IT AGAIN
[0:55:28] <Pwgregory> I shot the President, but I did not kill the Vice President.
[0:55:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> Leon was a bad enough dude to kill the president.
[0:55:29] <%Punchasaur> Oh pat thinks shooting people you know gets easier the more you do it
[0:55:29] <HealingMind> Why is the president of a country in a barely lit random room?
[0:55:29] <%Ipsenscastle> Leon is no Gerard Butler
[0:55:31] <+MrAtheGreat> Actually, Ada very definitely wouldn’t have a problem killing a zombo either
[0:55:31] <%D3rrtyD4n> i like Helena
[0:55:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SO ANYWAYS I STARTED BLASTING
[0:55:34] <CrimsonFox777> Why couldn't Lady Leon shoot the President?

[0:56:50] <%happyface699> OH GOD NO TIME ISNT WORKIN
[0:56:51] <$floralkami> Oh, this is more like remake2
[0:56:51] <theangryguyofde> Leon is as big as he is in Pat's Heart
[0:56:51] <%Neo_Kaiser> Big Leon is better
[0:56:52] <trianglehat> do coop tho coward
[0:56:53] <%heartlesshealer> Paige would get super lost
[0:56:53] <%Maids4lyfe> paige would be blind
[0:56:53] <%ArcLifth> its CoD
[0:56:54] <%Oxybe> The president was making a speech on how to not get your daughter captured. Leon came to protest.
[0:56:54] <+Yakobro> paige LUL
[0:56:54] <dukenux> I remember that you could bought rl Leon's Jacket. for 4k...
[0:56:54] <TheArrow_> even i can't see anything
[0:56:55] <$OmegaWeltall> there's no time to explain why there's no time to explain Kappa
[0:56:56] <Baeltyr> Paige would never see anything ever
[0:56:57] <boogaleeboo> That was a different character. Bigger Leon.
[0:56:57] <Monkeyweed21> I DONT HAVE TIME TO EXPLAIN WHAT I DONT HAVE TIME TO EXPLAIN
[0:56:58] <%krawtch> this room is made to run out of

[0:57:00] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt Paige would just end up constantly shooting at you
[0:57:01] <%patriotrenegade> Did you know "STRAND" means "BEACH" in German???
[0:57:01] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> yeah on splitscreen this would have been horrible
[0:57:02] <+Eiiriika> Man this camera sure makes me wanna play RE2make

[0:57:03] <$floralkami> Oh god
[0:57:03] <C24U> IT WOuLD BE FUNNY THOUGH
[0:57:04] <%Fien111> This game is a visual clusterfuck
[0:57:04] <FalseEyeD> RE5 didn't have color either
[0:57:04] <+flexin_apex> More hunch
[0:57:05] <augusta_wind> paige wouldn't be able to see a god damn thing
[0:57:05] <dukenux> Not Safe for Paige Eyes
[0:57:08] <%damienlunas> It might as well be a black screen for paige
[0:57:09] <derekwst3> its blue
[0:57:09] <usurper_sos> Perfectly calibrated
[0:57:09] <%cvp5127> why
[0:57:11] <Sammang> Pat can you look at the big bagels?
[0:57:12] <%marvel877> Paige can barely see her black n white cat anyways.
[0:57:12] <%GabeSweetMan> Why not NOW?!
[0:57:12] <ahbhajit> this game is a nightmare in splitscreen
[0:57:13] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt wasn't this room fucking lighted green in the cutscene?

[0:57:19] <%Kataguro> Get ready to get strung along by Helena for 2 hours
[0:57:20] <%dylanhack> Wasn't there a movie that describes what happened before this? I think there's the CGI movies that explain shit between the games
[0:57:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> "We;'' talk about it later, I swear"
[0:57:21] <%xUmbraNinja> Turn brightness up
[0:57:21] <duffydirty> Silent Hill 2 looked better than this LUL
[0:57:21] <%Neo_Kaiser> Your co-op partner has a big glowing icon over them Pat
[0:57:22] <mr_dangus> finally an actual RE game
[0:57:22] <+demonscratch> Helena could explain almost the entire plot right now but just chooses not to.
[0:57:22] <%Tucker0603> PAIGE BIG BLIND

[0:57:31] <+tangoragahn> Really Leon?
[0:57:31] <FalseEyeD> THUNK
[0:57:32] <%sniffy77> Leon literally killed a entire Spanish parasite town les by a creepy cult dude and a asshole child, I think nothing is too crazy for him to believe.
[0:57:33] <%tusk102> oooooooooooh
[0:57:34] <Captain_Krunk> Not scaryt

[0:57:36] <Louie_Salmon> Why isn't Leon a sweet baby boy
[0:57:37] <derekwst3> Helena is the cross bow killer
[0:57:37] <%rooooooooooot> nice one
[0:57:38] <%mighty_max_t> Just like RE2 locker room
[0:57:38] <%Neo_Kaiser> You can turn off friendly fire.
[0:57:38] <%solidousstream> psa1guy
[0:57:39] <%michingmallecho> Perfectly balanced. In darkness we are born. In darkness we shall leave
[0:57:39] <mannywatcha> Should he make sure that guy isn't a zombie?
[0:57:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> How did Leon get here?
[0:57:39] <%bevyrage> can't just STEP OVER a corpse
[0:57:39] <munchkay> Who voices Leon in this game?
[0:57:39] <$floralkami> BONK
[0:57:41] <DigTheSquig> "Here too" like it wouldn't reach a room over??????
[0:57:41] <Captain_Krunk> Might have been scary if it were RE 2 remake

[0:58:59] <%Ebony_Crowe> Wasn't this the game demo from Dragon's Dogma?
[0:58:59] <usurper_sos> RACOON
[0:58:59] <%Shadicara> Never forgetti
[0:59:00] <%MSN04_Sazabi> It's fucking Leon, of course he survived. Not sure about Helena though.
[0:59:00] <+Lost_Zombie> leon is immune to all viruses clearly
[0:59:00] <+mcjimbo12> how can you "not believe" this leon
[0:59:00] <%Fien111> One of about 5
[0:59:00] <TungstenViper> REALLY LEON? Pepega
[0:59:00] <%Ipsenscastle> Won't somebody think of the dinner
[0:59:01] <Divantae> "It's just llike Raccoon" for like the 5th time
[0:59:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> EXPOSITIONNNNNN
[0:59:02] <%SirGO0SE> dont you love balloon
[0:59:02] <dukenux> Leon destroys yet another welcome party :(
[0:59:03] <trianglehat> never forghetti
[0:59:03] <ahbhajit> leon has the best worst luck, he's survived like 99 apocalyptic scenarios
[0:59:04] <%dariusclover> They were busy putting on plot armor
[0:59:04] <%espanishcanamurciana> I'll never forget it
[0:59:05] <FalseEyeD> Leon
[0:59:05] <%blondie_ow> 1998 I'LL NEVER FORGET IT
[0:59:05] <%solidousstream> this is the second party that's dead after Leon's showed up
[0:59:05] <trueherobappo> My fat ass is thinking about all the wasted food..
[0:59:06] <VirtuaRailith> Leon did all of RE4 by now. He should be numb to this
[0:59:07] <%Savarro> Like Leon I get but how the FUCk did Helena survive
[0:59:07] <%InugamiTheHound> raccoon?
[0:59:08] <Javthusiast> atpShh
[0:59:08] <%Kataguro> Except she won't
[0:59:09] <%JZPotter> @MrDonTacos_ Why? He sounds just like RE 4 Leon
[0:59:09] <AxelCezar> "cant believe" its the fucking sixth game

[0:59:11] <therealtacopancakes> You hype for this pat?
[0:59:12] <%GabeSweetMan> Uh... then just talk about it.
[0:59:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> freedon
[0:59:13] <T_Sasquatch> Punished Leon
[0:59:14] <C24U> The plane section makes the least sense
[0:59:14] <keyworthe> whose the voice actor for leon?
[0:59:16] <FalseEyeD> Leon's voice is ridiculous
[0:59:16] <%professormorrigan> Is this Mercer?
[0:59:16] <devanmuse> it's also pretty dumb to go from an in media res cold open into a DIFFERENT in media res cold open
[0:59:17] <+Skelegroove> Does he count as a survivor when he intentionally went into the city?
[0:59:18] <%xcompleasedad> THIS IS SUCH BAD WRITING
[0:59:20] <dukenux> 1998 Bitey Summer
[0:59:21] <Monkeyweed21> THIS IS BIGGER THAN JAIL LEON

[0:59:27] <keyworthe> IS THAT MERCER?
[0:59:28] <Pwgregory> Freedom? Leon would execute her if she caused this.
[0:59:28] <usurper_sos> Why wouldn't he just say Raccoon City?
[0:59:28] <%Ipsenscastle> gallop gallop
[0:59:29] <trianglehat> only way to find out is shooting it
[0:59:29] <%JJCheeker> It was G man
[0:59:29] <%Shadicara> Lies
[0:59:29] <+SlumberMan> @PatStaresAt This whole sequence makes me even angrier when I think that a big university would be a great location for an RE game.

[1:07:11] <+secretspud> Look at that giant doughnut
[1:07:12] <$RenegadeHatter> I'll never forgive the review scores for this game
[1:07:12] <mr_dangus> pls kill them
[1:07:12] <Lionkevinson> Liam
[1:07:12] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I bet you're right.
[1:07:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> Did he just die?
[1:07:14] <augusta_wind> oh these people are totally definitely surviving
[1:07:14] <AutechreTwinAphex> it also weirdly enough looks worse than RE5 despite being more advanced in some ways
[1:07:14] <iwa5h4ck3d> This game killed Liam
[1:07:15] <+Remery_> get the doughnuts
[1:07:15] <%happyface699> LIAM NOO
[1:07:16] <%BalloniWright> LIAM'S DEAD psaSmug
[1:07:16] <%za7az> Liam... BibleThump
[1:07:17] <ahbhajit> This game is emblematic of a lot of bad trends of that era
[1:07:18] <C24U> There is a scene later with it literally turning on
[1:07:18] <%JJCheeker> Liam didn't exist
[1:07:20] <%Conyst> shoot her shoooooot heeeeer
[1:07:20] <%studleydoorite> no his hair is in cutscenes
[1:07:21] <HealingMind> So, was that girl just playing the piano while ZOMBIES were everywhere?

[1:07:24] <trianglehat> we need Paige to kill the women
[1:07:24] <dukenux> Vita means dead jermaPluto
[1:07:25] <TungstenViper> SO BORING...
[1:07:26] <%happyface699> Otaku LIAM
[1:07:26] <hat_under_bread> I like how an option to skip QTEs is an official part of the Xbox Accessibility Standards. They also directly call them bad design.
[1:07:27] <%xUmbraNinja> psaDab psaDab
[1:07:27] <%Shadicara> She looks pretty diseased
[1:07:28] <smig> Gameplay of any kind still hasn't happened
[1:07:28] <duffydirty> I just like to think it's laser eyes and not a device
[1:07:28] <%SirGO0SE> whats liam?
[1:07:28] <boogaleeboo> So did she snuff them on her own?
[1:07:29] <%JJCheeker> He was a figment of our imagination
[1:07:30] <usurper_sos> [REDACTED] has died
[1:07:32] <derekwst3> Liz is lucky paige isnt here @PatStaresAt
[1:07:32] <megaminimechamocha> Liam still lives, this game is no longer canon
[1:07:33] <%rytisone> Liam in the vents, making chandaliers fall down
[1:07:34] <%Kataguro> Gotta hook the kids
[1:07:35] <%Intersceptre> Tell you what, this game looks BETTER than I remember
[1:07:36] <%linSP> to get you HOOKED
[1:07:37] <%Fien111> Tonal Blueballs
[1:07:38] <biomegabear> then a HOT section
[1:07:39] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> keeps you on your toes
[1:07:39] <%professormorrigan> we warm now
[1:07:39] <%rooooooooooot> didnt you have fun though? :)
[1:07:40] <%YakumoYomi> [REDACTED] never existed
[1:07:40] <%InugamiTheHound> that flashlight clipped to the ear is so dumb
[1:07:40] <silverira> NO TIME
[1:07:41] <%heartlesshealer> c o n t r a s t
[1:07:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> This university was designed by George Trevor
[1:07:42] <+tangoragahn> Copypaste environments
[1:07:43] <LethalPlacebo> Aren't you excited to do that exact intro scene all over again?
[1:07:44] <%DensityD> ASS GUNS
[1:07:44] <%tank7013> Liz's character model always struck me as off. I can't put my finger on it but she looks weird
[1:07:46] <%rooooooooooot> he cums out his ass
[1:07:46] <%bevyrage> hot open before you enter the fridge
[1:07:46] <%Ilpala> CUMMING OUT HIS ASS?!
[1:07:46] <FriendlyCheer> ew
[1:07:47] <FalseEyeD> ass coming
[1:07:47] <Escherite> cumming out his ass
[1:07:47] <BlueEyesWhiteFatass> ass cums
[1:07:47] <%BalloniWright> LIAM IS DEAD psaSmug
[1:07:47] <Aydarkzero> yeah but Chris's sections get boring really fast
[1:07:48] <DazzlingFuhrer> poopy chute
[1:07:48] <megaminimechamocha> Chris CUMMING OUT HIS ASS
[1:07:49] <suikudo> poopy cum shoots
[1:07:49] <%Mister_McDerp> cuming out his ass?
[1:07:50] <+Remery_> ass cuming
[1:07:50] <%tusk102> CUMMING OUT HIS ASS
[1:07:50] <%linSP> that intro happens at the end of leon's game
[1:07:51] <augusta_wind> cumming out his ass?
[1:07:51] <mannywatcha> Man no video game would never ever show a little child getting torn apart by zombies.
[1:07:51] <+CptCreampuff16> shoulda done sherry
[1:07:52] <ToastedAeolo> odd, I don't remember the daughter being alive haha
[1:07:52] <Fro5tburn> peepoPooPoo
[1:07:54] <%sjay449> @PatStaresAt They played Uncharted 2 and went "Media res is cool"
[1:07:54] <+mcjimbo12> chris is doing what out his ass
[1:07:56] <+CptCreampuff16> its the best
[1:07:57] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Why would you not lead them? You know, the guy with the gun. Why have the walking wounded lead?
[1:07:57] <dukenux> cumming out his ass sounds like a condition
[1:07:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> Loading screen woooooooooo
[1:08:00] <%rooooooooooot> peepoPee
[1:08:00] <%Oxybe> MAKE AMERICA GRAHAM AGAIN
[1:08:01] <+Toblo1> @PatStaresAt Doubly so since Leon's start would easily be able to tutorialize like the prologue did
[1:08:03] <Captain_Krunk> You mean the roid freak? Sure. I'd love to play me some more zombie shootem up
[1:08:03] <boogaleeboo> I mean it's not even like the original trilogy were slow intros or anything
[1:08:04] <%Conyst> followed by a lukewarm open
[1:08:04] <%CalebHatesGames> chris's ass cum was always his most important character trait
[1:08:05] <Grennold> gachiBASS GMAE OF THE YEAR
[1:08:06] <%patriotrenegade> Its the pillar the held up the coliseum Samson was in
[1:08:07] <wrydiculous> I always play Chris's campaign first
[1:08:07] <Divantae> all NPC models look terrible in this game lol and they immediately die
[1:08:11] <amused_platypus> Its Icy Hot, not Hot Cold
[1:08:11] <%Varlinator> It's like warming up your dick, then dunking it in cold water
[1:08:11] <%Laecerelius> random wood
[1:08:11] <mannywatcha> That is dumb.
[1:08:12] <%Shadicara> This is awful
[1:08:12] <%krawtch> remember in RE2 when you start the game in the street and its like WHOA MOVE IT but then you get to the police station and its kind of calm for a sec? Pat doesn't.
[1:08:12] <%templar010> ...
[1:08:13] <Javthusiast> Yeah uncharted 2
[1:08:14] <%Punchasaur> Down the poop chute
[1:08:15] <%bevyrage> it fell back down AND DUPLICATED itself
[1:08:15] <%goose_attack_almanac> she looks like she pooped herself
[1:08:15] <transporterthesequel> Liz is fucking HUGE
[1:08:16] <garidoskill> Obviously the planks were infected too
[1:08:16] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt Liz is clipping into her dad... like a lot
[1:08:18] <+demonscratch> My favourite part of the game is the subway level, where it will turn off your light to let a zombie you've already seen jump scare you, and will turn on and off if you walk backwards and forwards on the point where it turns off
[1:08:19] <Combat_Data> Always let the civvies go first
[1:08:20] <duffydirty> what a hero
[1:08:21] <black_pariah> somebody mentioned that both opens are in media res
[1:08:21] <%trustycoyote> But... but didn't it stand.... oh whatever
[1:08:23] <%templar010> So this is a not good one huh
[1:08:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> YEAH CUTSCENE
[1:08:25] <+tangoragahn> Waist high immovable barricades
[1:08:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> Bang
[1:08:27] <Captain_Krunk> Thank god they're going back to the original design of Chris
[1:08:27] <%heartlesshealer> family meal?
[1:08:27] <%king_wragles> IT'S EVEN HAPPENING IN THE CUT SCENE COME ON
[1:08:27] <AttentionPelican> Not to mention the hot open already sets up the 'how the fuck did we get here?' vibe just for this to do the same thing but...slow
[1:08:28] <%Fien111> Wasn't power out?
[1:08:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> Bang bang bang
[1:08:30] <+Cityscape17> I bought the collectors edition of this game when it first came out and went to the midnight launch. Best reason to get it is it had every otherRE game as a dlc code
[1:08:30] <%espanishcanamurciana> @krawtch hahahaha
[1:08:32] <TungstenViper> WHY DID WE HAVE TO PLAY THAT?
[1:08:33] <+MrAtheGreat> Because people like Leon more than Chris.
[1:08:33] <mr_dangus> kill her
[1:08:33] <%JJCheeker> Obviously she is going to turn and kill him
[1:08:34] <%Shadicara> Stab them both now

[1:08:37] <+SlumberMan> I actually like Chris's campmaign the most because it's far and away the most consistent and you have the most control.
[1:08:37] <usurper_sos> KILL HER
[1:08:37] <mannywatcha> So is the daughter gonna turn or the father gonna turn first?
[1:08:38] <%professormorrigan> Nothing wrong here.

[1:10:29] <%Ascethetic> I like how in a cutscene, 1 shot to head is enough to kill a zombie, but gameplay requires 2-4

[1:11:21] <ahbhajit> leon bout to rko some zombies

[1:11:33] <%tank7013> That RKO is the best part of this game easy
[1:11:33] <TafferAA> zombie abuse
[1:11:33] <boogaleeboo> This is the "Slow, original style RE" chapter?
[1:11:34] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt disabled cutscene ones
[1:11:35] <%thatjuantoo> IS LEON A CHARGE CHARACTER?
[1:11:35] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> man this does NOT feel like a resident evil game.
[1:11:35] <AutechreTwinAphex> it's like they wanted to turn resident evil into death stranding
[1:11:35] <%linSP> kung fu time

[1:11:51] <Jane_Lo> Correct
[1:11:52] <pfctwinkletoes> Turn them back on.
[1:11:52] <wrydiculous> I like how it went from slow horror to RKO OUT OF NOWHERE
[1:11:53] <%Shadicara> Kick them
[1:11:55] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Can we get away from the car alarms?
[1:11:55] <%trustycoyote> The tackle sound happened before the shoulder check happened....
[1:11:56] <Djmadraws> I saw the cop drop a gun on the hood of the car
[1:11:57] <Fro5tburn> this looks a lot like the parking garage in RE2
[1:11:58] <KingVantq> isnt ammo on the cop car?
[1:12:00] <%Erimos> Become the ammo
[1:12:01] <Captain_Krunk> Yeah because no one expects cut scenes to just randomly throw you a curve ball

[1:12:12] <AttentionPelican> I hate how the guns feel in this game. Feels like there is zero weight or impact when you shoot stuff. In RE4 you knew when you shot the game and you extra knew when you hit a mother fucker.

[1:16:28] <+Cityscape17> bullets on the stairs pat, go get em!!
[1:16:28] <%linSP> we aint seen SHIT
[1:16:28] <RAPHCOM> You can save a lot of ammo timing the dodge. It’s crucial in Mercenaries
[1:16:29] <ahaegotrigger> I can see wood now
[1:16:29] <%cervidaequus> Shiny shiny dark
[1:16:30] <%LaughingCatt> the table is a floodlight tho

[1:16:31] <%Intersceptre> can't WAIT for the graveyards palette
[1:16:32] <pfctwinkletoes> Never go to lectures without my bullets.
[1:16:32] <+Owltosser> The dark parts are dark, but the light on the desk is hella bright
[1:16:33] <derekwst3> its perfect for me
[1:16:34] <+sin_grimmly> PogChamp
[1:16:34] <%Punchasaur> Is better
[1:16:35] <pfctwinkletoes> Just the bullets, no gun.
[1:16:35] <Dutchpotato> I can see
[1:16:35] <tigerfang86> OMEGA WRONG
[1:16:37] <+HaunchPaunch> It still looks like vaseline.
[1:16:37] <%DensityD> psaWrong
[1:16:38] <%heartlesshealer> Cross menu is for mixing and dropping items only
[1:16:42] <augusta_wind> why even bother including it if it's gonna be so wrong
[1:16:44] <trianglehat> it's a big lie
[1:16:44] <usurper_sos> psaWrong
[1:16:44] <%joylent_blue> they just want you to be blind that's all
[1:16:45] <Captain_Krunk> Yeah, games these days want you to play at a certain level of brightness, and it just leaves you very blind
[1:16:46] <%Fien111> Unperfectly Calibrated
[1:16:46] <%chhdez> Callibrations
[1:16:46] <tanarath> it's the bloon
[1:16:47] <+tangoragahn> This is the Dark Souls of Resident Evils
[1:16:47] <%xUmbraNinja> psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong
[1:16:47] <Vohs_Bru> WRONGEST
[1:16:47] <%Ixiah> maybe its your TV ? Kappa
[1:16:48] <%Shadicara> Supposed to be super dark for THE SPOOKS pat
[1:16:49] <+Cityscape17> also, did this game take influence from Dead Space 3??
[1:16:50] <megaminimechamocha> There was no time to fix the 6.
[1:16:52] <tanarath> bloom*
[1:16:55] <+nekodelic> is this MT Framework?
[1:16:57] <hat_under_bread> But not being able to see 5 feet in front of you is HORROR
[1:16:57] <%MoulesFritz> this is the DMC2 of resident evil and you should legit just do rev2 instead
[1:16:57] <%trustycoyote> That amount of bloom is unreal
[1:16:58] <%Th3SmartAlec> Also the game's super dark all over so it's hard to tell
[1:16:58] <mannywatcha> If a black person stood in that lightning you would never see them.
[1:16:59] <bigtofu13> Can’t see any of the cutscenes
[1:17:01] <MoonlightWolves> Missed herb up other flight of stairs
[1:17:01] <+Cityscape17> this game feels very dead space 3
[1:17:04] <derekwst3> look out the window
[1:17:05] <%rooooooooooot> but the balls will warm it
[1:17:05] <%heartlesshealer> crotch can
[1:17:06] <%MoulesFritz> rev2 is the REAL re6
[1:17:06] <KingVantq> @PatStaresAt a herb was in that room
[1:17:10] <%Punchasaur> Or maybe the tv is wrong
[1:17:10] <%Lizard0TM> Where ARE you? And why are you there?
[1:17:10] <megaminimechamocha> Elmo's drinking the waterrrrrrrrrrrr
[1:17:12] <%Erimos> @nekodelic yes
[1:17:13] <Galacta_Pieta> Then how much worse is it at minimum volume>?>>
[1:17:15] <%spiritofmojave> Rev 2 is such a step up from all this shit, PLUS IT HAS BARRY :D
[1:17:18] <dukenux> thought that a prompt to jump out the window
[1:17:19] <%heartlesshealer> YES
[1:17:20] <%Shadicara> Goblins begin
[1:17:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Cityscape17 "You wanted horror? Shut up and shoot gun"
[1:17:24] <GUNxSPECTRE> Agent Sherry is Legit the Best thing about thyis game
[1:17:26] <%xUmbraNinja> Rev2 is the real RE6
[1:17:27] <+Owltosser> I’m so happy remake2 wasn’t like this, despite featuring similar over-the-shoulder POV
[1:17:29] <%maskofmichael> Just jump out the window and end it all Leon
[1:17:29] <%코코꾸라> Just pump the brightness to the max please
[1:17:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat I think this game may suck, just a hunch.

[1:40:19] <%ExpressNode> Leon has the stomping power of a fucking Bronco holy shit
[1:40:19] <mydudefrightface> "we gotta reveal the truth about raccoon city even though at this point in the series there's been a bajillion other things that happened as well"
[1:40:19] <goldengrolar> @PaleBloodInk No. Rev2, yes

[1:40:20] <%Intersceptre> no zombo has those honkers
[1:40:20] <%StripesUltimateEdition> why are the sewers connected to a subway rail
[1:40:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> @PaleBloodInk Jill sections are good, but it's a middle of the road RE game I feel
[1:40:21] <myriad_truth> Bring back Ashley!

[1:40:37] <%CalebHatesGames> Dead Space still did it best
[1:40:39] <SlappyMeats> the President is voiced by Michael Donovan. I wasn't hearing any resemblance to Matt Mercer at all.
[1:40:39] <+Owltosser> Yes
[1:40:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> Why hasn't the military been called in?
[1:40:40] <%krawtch> you need a character named FOLLOW like COD has
[1:40:40] <%Quikanims> whatever helps get you through this game faster
[1:40:40] <boogaleeboo> Rev 2 is the much better game
[1:40:42] <chidere> OH NO NOT THE TRAIN

[1:54:22] <tactician0> quick take count of how long they last
[1:54:22] <+RadicalPirate> I do feel back that Matt Mercer played Leon in the worst RE games. He's actually a good Leon
[1:54:23] <%noappedixman> noappedixman subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! 
[1:54:26] <%ssjklyco> Yes
[1:54:28] <+kyoko_ku> depending how long Pat takes to come back will say lot about his stamina lol
[1:54:31] <+RadicalPirate> bad, not back*
[1:54:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> @xemnahort The RE6 Logo resembles a giraffe getting a blowjob
[1:54:37] <%Punchasaur> She’s making pat dress like agumon
[1:54:37] <+qwazzeon> Finally, he's playing the RE game that is actually good except for the story.
[1:54:38] <%tusk102> the paint is stored in the paige
[1:54:42] <%KishinGrek> much sexy wow times
[1:54:45] <+OhioNitsud> pat is seeing if his balls can taste mustard
[1:54:46] <%Shadicara> Pat ran right past paige like thank fuck I have an excuse to stop playing Kappa

[1:54:51] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @xemnahort google re6 giraffe
[1:54:52] <%outis94> Mercer was a good leon
[1:54:52] <augusta_wind> pat stop fucking your girlfriend and get back here so you can fuck RE6
[1:54:56] <boogaleeboo> I mean all the action shit makes it a bad game
[1:54:56] <%j0ustar> 5 minute quickie aaaaannnddd back to game
[1:54:57] <%moogleboy1984> since Paige is taller, does that mean Pat is going up on her?
[1:55:00] <%nmaten> i hope hes either gone for like 2 minutes or 2 and a half hours
[1:55:08] <keyworthe> they're taking their sweet time to have BIG SEX PENIS PUSSY
[1:55:09] <%xemnahort> @th3smartalec ok thx
[1:55:09] <%Shadicara> RE6 is definitely fucking pat more than he's fucking it Kappa

[1:56:45] <AntChodeny> Pat does the big sex
[1:56:48] <+transmiqote> Probably because as an RE game it stopped being RE? It's just full goofy shooter. ..which I enjoy. far, far too much.

[1:57:36] <%sjay449> Pat is running out of his home so he doesn't have to play RE6 anymore
[1:57:38] <leinadtonu> Pat is making sure to continue the Boivin bloodline

[2:15:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> Now for all the tension to drain from the scene
[2:15:26] <LustrousEudemon> tiny barrel huge explosion, gas station tiny explosion
[2:15:27] <%goose_attack_almanac> Wouldn't that explode the gaslines under the city
[2:15:29] <%panzershock21> Its the cop from outbreak "You startled me"
[2:15:29] <%코코꾸라> EL BARRIL
[2:15:29] <godzookylives> this game is hyperactive
[2:15:29] <%Shadicara> HURRY PAT THERE'S NO TIME
[2:15:29] <+Lost_Echo> Is he at least using cheats? It's the only way to make the game somewhat bearable
[2:15:30] <%rytisone> Leon just wants his vodka
[2:15:31] <%JJCheeker> This looks just like a Call of Duty map
[2:15:32] <natebud> imported skill points
[2:15:32] <%Neo_Kaiser> Zombies weren't in RE4.
[2:15:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> @MattDemers Duck em
[2:15:32] <%DensityD> YUROP
[2:15:32] <AntChodeny> with these assets they could've done another Outbreak game.

[2:15:44] <Brigins> How bad does a game have to be to make me angry every time i see it
[2:15:44] <jerobees> It's "Europe", Pat
[2:15:45] <tiaramaki> @Punchasaur But the Ganados weren't zombies, they had some modicum of intelligence
[2:15:45] <+VCRUZZO> he is way in the street, the other gun zombies were in the truck
[2:15:45] <%Erimos> It'd be funny if the barrel had pesetas in it.
[2:15:47] <chaos2frozen> lying on the ground recovers stamina faster
[2:15:47] <%LaughingCatt> Those non-distinct Europeans, they sure knew how to make barrels

[2:21:05] <ricky12k> Well this is great. We can see it.
[2:21:06] <+Skelegroove> That is a terrible shotgun. No impact at all
[2:21:07] <%theo_marks> the shotgun in this game seems worse thanm the pistol...
[2:21:07] <%Mister_McDerp> HUNTER
[2:21:07] <%CaityCoopScoops> ahahahahah
[2:21:08] <%Erimos> your elbow has more impact than a shotgun
[2:21:09] <SlimeBoogey> when they are about to leap u use the dodge roll Pat
[2:21:10] <MayorRev> this feels like the Netflix adaptation of a resident evil game
[2:21:11] <leinadtonu> I saw nothing, man.
[2:21:13] <%SirGO0SE> LUL

[2:21:18] <%juxtest> This game is such a mess
[2:21:18] <+wampa661> Pat there’s a dodge prompt if you’re not actively shooting when it happens
[2:21:19] <axeofmontgomery> The camera just snaps everywhere
[2:21:19] <+FrenchTact1cs> stunner
[2:21:20] <seniortrump> RKO
[2:21:22] <%StrawberryPantsu> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

[2:21:23] <bananawarrior1> just got here
[2:21:24] <augusta_wind> i love it when they just fly across the screen
[2:21:24] <GUNxSPECTRE> I can't believe it took this long for RE to start Move Shooting
[2:21:24] <DashXero> How many campaigns has Pat beaten?
[2:21:24] <natebud> When has an RE zombie ever attacked from the floor?
[2:21:25] <+TheSaintJohn> outa nowhere
[2:21:25] <Deadbulky> But sick rkos tho
[2:21:25] <%krawtch> perhaps you could try some rolling
[2:21:26] <42nfl19> Cant pat do a dive back to dodge?
[2:21:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> man this looks bad honestly.
[2:21:26] <ahbhajit> you have to dodge leaps
[2:21:28] <bananawarrior1> oh hes not doing co op?
[2:21:31] <%D3rrtyD4n> wait until the next part atpCap
[2:21:32] <+Starlight_Gamer> bs zombies
[2:21:33] <black_pariah> IMMEDIATE V-ACT!
[2:21:33] <%theo_marks> no impact, plus it makes you completely lock into that animation
[2:21:34] <%SirGO0SE> DO IT
[2:21:34] <Kostas1001> @PatStaresAt is this supposed to be the cabin from re4 version 3 ?
[2:21:34] <+Kokoro_Breaker> i mean compared to umbrella corps

[2:21:50] <%professormorrigan> Meanwhile RE7 takes place in a SINGLE HOUSE pretty much
[2:21:54] <stealthfart> This sequence should have been over like two minutes ago
[2:21:54] <%xxshadowxx416> that was cool
[2:21:55] <%Punchasaur> I will never understand why characters in fiction walk in melee range of their target while pointing a gun at them
[2:21:56] <SlimeBoogey> trust me i hate the game as much as u but there are mechanics to offset the horrible zombies
[2:21:56] <%heartlesshealer> when do you get to use your skill points?
[2:21:57] <%jiin6> Purchase skills?
[2:21:58] <pfctwinkletoes> Why doesn't Leon take any of these guns?
[2:21:59] <Combat_Data> This is almost as bad to watch as it is to play
[2:21:59] <rcand9> bad game for bad people Kappa
[2:22:01] <%panzershock21> Eat this to get learnt
[2:22:01] <Deadbulky> Pat keeping himself motivated
[2:22:01] <SlimeBoogey> just gotta know how to use them
[2:22:02] <%InugamiTheHound> you need to go to the 2nd floor?
[2:22:04] <myriad_truth> RE1 takes place in a single house
[2:22:04] <Ultimatefool> Pat how do you feel about people who say this is their favorite RE?

[2:27:55] <%KaosMachina> So, I actually got into RE6 recently and I have a conclusion: RE6 is an excellent game with the worst campaign in the series and it's worth getting in a bundle for mercenaries no mercy

[2:27:56] <tigerfang86> HOW DOES THAT WORK

[2:28:18] <SlappyMeats> one of the worst things about this game is when you start to do one of the "fun bits" of playing like a video game, unlocking highest rankings, etc. all the sections are HOURS long, so repeated playthroughs are MISERABLE
[2:28:20] <Brigins> it does not take that long to pull someone up
[2:28:20] <silverira> how would I notice never played that shit
[2:28:22] <+Irridium> try the dodge roll?

[2:28:27] <Run44forrest> 4 people cannot pull up an old man
[2:28:29] <%tank7013> This chapter is horribly unbalanced ammo wise. Especially for how it ends

[2:30:33] <AutechreTwinAphex> I wonder if project resistance is similar trash like this
[2:30:33] <%rytisone> imagine if Paige was vulnerable as well
[2:30:34] <+ZephynM> This game was kinda fun when I tried it. But I gave it a hard no when I had to go swimming.
[2:30:34] <jorniev> I WOULD BE PUKING ALL OVER THE PLACE

[2:30:39] <+mecharocky> It's honestly astounding how subdued and confident RE7 is in itself compared to this. It feels like the devs on this game just threw things against the wall to see what stuck
[2:30:40] <stranger59> Kick everything
[2:30:40] <%D3rrtyD4n> you have to mostly melee
[2:30:40] <Brigins> just let go of the gun fucknut

[2:30:57] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> he totally did
[2:30:57] <tigerfang86> THEY BLEW UP???
[2:30:57] <stranger59> So close to retirement...

[2:30:59] <Run44forrest> LUL SO CLOSE
[2:30:59] <%Mister_McDerp> he really wasn't

[2:31:01] <%Th3SmartAlec> Great writing for that scene
[2:31:01] <AxelCezar> MUSIC LOUD AS FUCK NOW
[2:31:02] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @PatStaresAt The game is more balanced around you using your MELEE skills all the time, literally every chance you get
[2:31:03] <pfctwinkletoes> You want to help Helena
[2:31:03] <lwpabloelenano2hc> he full kamikaze there
[2:31:03] <RyanSmoothies> that was gangster
[2:31:04] <%tusk102> what the fuck....
[2:31:06] <%professormorrigan> THIS IS A SHITSHOW I LVOE IT
[2:31:06] <Deadbulky> He was only 1 day away from retirement!
[2:31:07] <TafferAA> i think i ran out here too
[2:31:07] <%chaumiester> Isn't there a special perk that lets you pick up more ammo if I remember correctly in this game?
[2:31:08] <Stab_master_ars0n> Get a bigger TV if it’s so hard to see
[2:31:09] <%king_wragles> Why is he honking?
[2:31:09] <Animorphimagi> Uuuuh use grenades on GROUPS
[2:31:09] <thelonechris> Why are there no seats on this bus?
[2:31:09] <Reise04> this just screams survival horror
[2:31:10] <%KaosMachina> Cheer100 Pat, advice: you're actually supposed to run Amateur until you've completed it once to have enough ammo for normal mode. Also: Mercenaries/Bonus Mode rankings for the series?
[2:31:10] <radicalflip> A
[2:31:12] <tragicjohnson84> The baby!
[2:31:12] <karl_rex> Why does this bus have no seats?
[2:31:18] <Brigins> honking the damn horn isnt helping dude
[2:31:20] <%unclekulikov> Leon doesn't react to 2 people dying. He knly acknowledges the old man dying.
[2:31:21] <tolloponik> they probably expected you to pop and Kick your way through everything
[2:31:21] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Could've just let go of his gun so the zombie wouldn't have yanked him out but whatever..
[2:31:24] <+keyoray> Lighting sucks
[2:31:24] <+BishopBain> The best games are the ones where are completely passive to what's happening. 4Head
[2:31:26] <KODRA> sometimes the most heroic thing you can do is nothing at all
[2:31:26] <myriad_truth> SHOOT THE FATTY
[2:31:29] <axeofmontgomery> 2000 zombies a minute
[2:31:29] <eldragon_1> This game is only fun if you online co-op
[2:31:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> FATTY
[2:31:33] <$Dakuu75> this is an RE game that wants you to kill everything. not very "survival".
[2:31:35] <Aydarkzero> @Corporate_Redeemer it was his favorite gun
[2:31:36] <OToole42> the only ai that does damage is helena
[2:31:37] <+Pyroclase> I can't wait until we get to the ancient european crypt of the texan family
[2:31:38] <KODRA> stand still and look in a corner, now you are a hero
[2:31:41] <%CaptainPileDriver> just shoot that fat fuck
[2:31:42] <AutechreTwinAphex> holy shit what an abortion
[2:31:43] <lionandfox21> Man this game reminds me why my family only placed it once
[2:31:43] <biomegabear> THE GAME EXPECTS YOU TO CONSERVE AMMO BECAUSE ITS A N RE GAME BUT YOU CANT
[2:31:44] <$Mopopolis> I hate this
[2:31:44] <+Skelegroove> But shoot the head tho
[2:31:45] <%D3rrtyD4n> you can melee them when they are on their knees
[2:31:45] <%G_Thunders> Yeah I dropped this game down to easy mode whatever ‘cause the ammo/health is so sparse
[2:31:45] <Brigins> stop with the horn!
[2:31:46] <vvitchguy> Slapstick.
[2:31:47] <OToole42> the rest are doing minimal damage per shot
[2:31:48] <%ssjklyco> Just shoot the boomer

[2:32:19] <YourFalloutCompanion> Can't wait for the other campaigns
[2:32:20] <natebud> considered the "best campaign" of RE6 by many

[2:32:26] <biomegabear> You are trying to survive but theres no horror

[2:33:20] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> woolie, you have to hit him

[2:33:50] <pfctwinkletoes> Did you try asking nicely?
[2:33:50] <%rytisone> try playing on hard

[2:34:30] <mastredeath1> Ya did it !
[2:34:31] <stealthfart> The game will do this at points. If you run out of ammo during or before a sequence, you are screwed. Happened to me the first time at a watery part in the 2nd chapter. I’m avoiding spoilers for others.
[2:34:31] <+jacintafor> Survival horror btw

[2:35:20] <%KaosMachina> The game is balanced around Amateur

[2:39:52] <+Starlight_Gamer> Nothing to see here
[2:39:52] <ammobasket> Better dead than UNdead

[2:40:14] <gordieda20> FUCK THIS AREA
[2:40:14] <HealingMind> This opening really highlights the subtle horror the series is known for with another EXPLODING VEHICLE
[2:40:15] <Aydarkzero> well that was pointless
[2:40:15] <%dme4546> Man this season of A Series of Unfortunate Events is dark

[2:40:23] <+Imperial_Madman> why
[2:40:26] <%Mister_McDerp> LUL
[2:40:26] <%PyodePlays> Action as written by someone who doesn't understand that you need to have stakes and it's boring if you make your characters unkillable superheroes.
[2:40:27] <DashXero> "Hi, Ashley. I killed your dad. That's a thing... Still want that 'overtime?' I could really use it right now..."
[2:40:27] <%JackKrauser> RE3 Remake's cemetery better look this cool..

[2:45:38] <tactician0> the tables has turn humane
[2:45:38] <Top_Lane_Duelist> these weird mini camera zoomings during melee are rubbing me the wrong way
[2:45:39] <+Rojanbo> The screen jolt is because he isn't aiming before pressing shoot
[2:45:41] <%Typhaeon> Terminator theme

[2:45:44] <Tronodood> Thought the second dog grabbed it for a moment there
[2:45:44] <Brigins> i think the only way i can ever be near this game without killing myself is if pat is playing
[2:45:45] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you're two missions in and they: had the cabin scene, had a run at the camera scene, AND introduced 5 new enemies
[2:45:48] <+AGrinreaper> @stevo_scar yea in mercenaries the campaign prohibits alot of mechanics
[2:45:51] <+Imperial_Madman> OMG if you go to the RE6 steam page it has a banner for you to pre purchase RE2
[2:45:51] <augusta_wind> @TuxedoNash that's how i've been feeling the whole time
[2:45:53] <+Skelegroove> It took several shotgun shells to kill a single dog
[2:45:55] <+bestcup> yeah but do you know about dual weilding them though?
[2:45:55] <%DedlokPM> Did she just shoot to the tune of the Terminator Theme?

[2:47:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> So the C virus creates activists!
[2:47:46] <augusta_wind> i have to take breaks from watching this game to periodically stare at the wall
[2:47:46] <%Aleate> The quickshot with the shotgun does less damage 😃

[2:48:20] <%unclekulikov> What does the snap shot do?
[2:48:21] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you're two missions in and they: had the cabin scene, had a run at the camera scene, AND introduced 5 new enemies
[2:48:22] <%Laecerelius> There was a green herb back at the gold door
[2:48:22] <%noappedixman> the way resident evil was meant to be
[2:48:23] <seaechiowai> is this dark souls
[2:48:24] <+NitronStreams> I cant believe they literally copied the zombies from L4D
[2:48:25] <%sjay449> thanks Laura Bailey
[2:48:26] <subSenpai> did he actually not see that herb?
[2:48:27] <%professormorrigan> are you having fun yet pat
[2:48:28] <+TheBitingIrish> @rcand9 I thought his was leagues better than Chris'
[2:48:28] <AutechreTwinAphex> now you know why RE7 had a low budget after this trash heap almost killed the series
[2:48:28] <SlappyMeats> you know you've made a gripping game when 2/3 of your character's dialog is "Oh great, ANOTHER _____"
[2:48:30] <%Typhaeon> Turf Wars with infinite roars existed in RE6, good to know
[2:48:30] <%DappercatEsquire> what a terrible night to have a video game
[2:48:31] <ahaegotrigger> God you can tell Pat is loving this
[2:48:31] <natebud> keep using emotes, the lines change
[2:48:32] <GarettLefebvre> bye herb
[2:48:33] <TafferAA> despawned LuL

[2:48:34] <%DedlokPM> Is this Anor Londo?
[2:48:35] <usurper_sos> Helena DLC
[2:48:36] <stranger59> Can they remake this into a new RE6 that isn't this?
[2:48:37] <autcetera> ph1lPump ph1lPump ph1lPump
[2:48:37] <%Rmxgirl> how Leon back not in pain
[2:48:37] <xeros720> like her nails or her hair
[2:48:37] <stevo_scar> No Co-Op with Paige I'm surprised
[2:48:38] <%NopeBadguy> helena may be as bland as a piece of wood, but at least she's hot
[2:48:40] <%ssjklyco> There is another screamer
[2:48:42] <%RowenCleric> only like 20 more streams of this
[2:48:42] <+jiggy_snipe> you may not like it but this is peak Resident Evil
[2:48:42] <lionandfox21> Not-Claire is at least decent

[2:48:59] <%Mister_McDerp> Resident Left 4 Souls
[2:49:00] <augusta_wind> the way it flew back before he kicked
[2:49:00] <AutechreTwinAphex> why would you want this remade? it has a trash story, trash environments, just play Vanquish if you want to play an action game
[2:49:00] <%emperordread> Did that zombo have a gimp suit?
[2:49:01] <thelonechris> Did that one have bondage gear on?
[2:49:01] <%ssjklyco> You can open some of the graves for points

[2:49:02] <%StrawberryPantsu> YOU WERE MINUS PAT LEARN THE FRAME DATA :^)
[2:49:03] <Run44forrest> does this game have dlc? did anyone play far enough to see it?
[2:49:04] <Linconlord> Welcome to the pacman maze!
[2:49:06] <%ElenaManetta> it's a placebo
[2:49:06] <RyanSmoothies> SACKED
[2:49:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> I love that these zombies have advanced grab mechanics to fuck you over
[2:49:11] <TuxedoNash> so it's paying homage to RE3?
[2:49:12] <%tusk102> @Haruharuharuko no pat just didn't want to ge the tiny ass screens for such a dark ass game
[2:49:12] <segbas2004> but, what about the action of the dodge
[2:49:13] <xeros720> godhand this ain't
[2:49:13] <%Shadicara> Get sucked into the zombie tackle
[2:49:13] <+Starlight_Gamer> Can you upgrade guns?
[2:49:15] <%DensityD> g r e a t
[2:49:15] <tigerfang86> SO COOL
[2:49:16] <JonEWorldbeater> There is way too much murky grey on the screen rn
[2:49:16] <%budyd> re6 is Pat's sword of Damocles
[2:49:16] <Aydarkzero> level your adaptability Kappa
[2:49:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> This ain't no Bayonetta, for sure
[2:49:18] <babo____> ?
[2:49:19] <tactician0> ye
[2:49:20] <wrydiculous> The zombie leap attack is absolute bullshit
[2:49:20] <%ssjklyco> It's dodgy at best
[2:49:22] <%noappedixman> this speedrun is hype
[2:49:22] <%jorgamund> I love it when the buttons I press do nothing!
[2:49:23] <Djinnazz> A C T I O N
[2:49:24] <Haruharuharuko> @tusk102 LUL
[2:49:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> nice dodge
[2:49:26] <lionandfox21> @Run44forrest as far as I can remember there's an Ada dlc and mercs
[2:49:27] <+jiggy_snipe> dodge the grab
[2:49:27] <%AwesomeDan_> this camera makes me nauseous.
[2:49:27] <lemonadeicecold> this game doesn't exist
[2:49:34] <GUNxSPECTRE> You went into cover tho
[2:49:34] <MayorRev> what was this games metacritic again?
[2:49:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt This is just practice for RE3Make's Dodges
[2:49:36] <TafferAA> RE3 is bringing the dodge back
[2:49:37] <%xxshadowxx416> you went to wall
[2:49:37] <OToole42> all it did was cancel your heal animation
[2:49:40] <segbas2004> so much action
[2:49:41] <biomegabear> this camera is making me sick
[2:49:41] <xeros720> eat those tums
[2:49:42] <%PyodePlays> actual real humans un-ironically praise this combat
[2:49:44] <myriad_truth> At least in RE3make the dodge looks great
[2:49:45] <tri3dgE027> The only use of the dodge I found useful is for Pierce's animation canceling when using his Rifle
[2:49:50] <+TheBitingIrish> I don't think the Ada campaign was DLC
[2:49:51] <+ssrdoki> @PatStaresAt I don't get why the Ai partner doesn't pick up extra ammo on the way to you like in re5
[2:49:58] <%ElenaManetta> i'm having fun
[2:49:58] <tigerfang86> its so bad
[2:50:01] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:50:02] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> Is this a David Cage game?
[2:50:02] <Haruharuharuko> This camera is so so much better than it was at launch like my god
[2:50:04] <%professormorrigan> im lovin it
[2:50:04] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL what
[2:50:04] <AutechreTwinAphex> oh man the suckage is just beginning
[2:50:05] <%tank7013> What?
[2:50:06] <AfroKing24> @TheBitingIrish its not
[2:50:07] <%AwesomeDan_> what
[2:50:07] <thelonechris> Really? I think it's amazing! Kappa
[2:50:07] <usurper_sos> ???
[2:50:08] <stevo_scar> But is it as bad as DMC2
[2:50:08] <%CalderGaming> that line is minutes late leon
[2:50:08] <+Andrizzleton> no dual wielding?
[2:50:08] <biomegabear> @PatStaresAt worse than CVX?
[2:50:08] <TuxedoNash> w o w
[2:50:08] <%rytisone> then don't paly it Kappa
[2:50:08] <%Typhaeon> uh
[2:50:10] <%tusk102> that was super delayed
[2:50:11] <nademonkey1100> thats why im glad you are playing it
[2:50:12] <myriad_truth> Does she want to get married?
[2:50:12] <%SoFarFetched> WHAT
[2:50:13] <derap41> This game came out in 2012
[2:50:13] <+jiggy_snipe> were they supposed to split up?
[2:50:14] <%ElenaManetta> it's an RPG
[2:50:15] <rcand9> it gets worse
[2:50:16] <Djinnazz> I remember this being a farming spot.
[2:50:16] <ammobasket> marriage proposal?
[2:50:17] <%Mister_McDerp> it seems like a frankenstein monster of stolen ideas
[2:50:17] <lionandfox21> The mechanics themselves handle well BUT MAN THIS GAME BLOWS DICK
[2:50:17] <xeros720> that door wasn't even locked
[2:50:17] <natebud> The one thing you have to worry about when playing utter trash liket his, is getting too used to blaming the game for everything. It's really hard though.
[2:50:18] <Reise04> so would this game have been ok if it wasnt called re6 and was instead a new thing?
[2:50:21] <%xUmbraNinja> psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand
[2:50:22] <%ssjklyco> Ready for cabin section. AGAIN
[2:50:23] <%BringBackSempai> Pat, if you hit the QTE on the lit part of the circle, you don't take damage I don't think
[2:50:24] <MayorRev> @elenamanetta what are you doing in this shitty game? get outta there!
[2:50:25] <Grennold> Isn't this game about 20 hours long?
[2:50:27] <%Laecerelius> Time for another bullet sponge boss probably
[2:50:28] <derap41> it also looks like shit
[2:50:28] <rcand9> this chapter gets worse
[2:50:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> Now, what's important here?

[2:51:42] <+NitronStreams> They read the part of the script that said "And then the zombies attacked again"
[2:51:42] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt so to recap this games flaws in without talking about movement or fighting: two missions in and they already had 2 cabin scenes, had a run at the camera scene, AND introduced 5 new enemies
[2:51:42] <%SirGO0SE> YEYEYE
[2:51:43] <%StrawberryPantsu> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE

[2:52:44] <+Andrizzleton> I'm not sure if the ally ai is god awful or if the game just makes you die sometimes
[2:52:44] <%Jekado> whats the point of the partner save feature if you die right as you get back up
[2:52:44] <BeefyQueefer> POOtrick Boy-van Smeels

[2:52:49] <jcflyguy> You can stop, Pat. You can end the nightmare now. Nobody will blame you.
[2:52:49] <nademonkey1100> not bad of a kill animation
[2:52:49] <%xxshadowxx416> that was cool
[2:52:49] <%SoFarFetched> @SSaryn watching this is slowly making me die inside.
[2:52:50] <%ForlornCarton> You weren't using that heart, were you?

[2:52:55] <%Shadicara> NO SKIP
[2:52:57] <%RavenHellkite> should have picked easy tbh
[2:53:01] <%tusk102> no skip
[2:53:04] <%BringBackSempai> that licker just pulled Easy Mode out of leon's chest
[2:53:05] <%Nobrev> pat it's ok we can skip to rev 2
[2:53:07] <%D3rrtyD4n> no skippy
[2:53:08] <stealthfart> I’ve said it multiple times tonight, they played COD and wanted to recreate those moments without understanding how or why they work.
[2:53:11] <Haruharuharuko> Setting this game on easy makes it more tolerable but maaaaaannnn
[2:53:11] <%Jumpie8> Are still saying that Code Veronica is worst then RE6?
[2:53:16] <%Th3SmartAlec> As long as the game says
[2:53:17] <biomegabear> No pat needs to play it
[2:53:18] <rcand9> should have played rev 2
[2:53:20] <+Lost_Echo> I remember giving up here and not coming back to the game for 4 years
[2:53:22] <Explodincatz> i think your meant to get game overs so you can heal
[2:53:23] <%Huntercd> These people get killed by Helena
[2:53:23] <%mMayrro> but why the fuck do they start hitting the bell tho
[2:53:25] <%tusk102> @Jumpie8 he already said re6 is the worst one
[2:53:29] <+Pyroclase> me and my buddy actually played this on veteran
[2:53:34] <Soulglove> gotta parry
[2:53:35] <+gwanzan> she's very optimistic
[2:53:36] <myriad_truth> He really shouldve played Rev 2
[2:53:39] <rcand9> thats dumb
[2:53:41] <thelonechris> That shitty game design
[2:53:41] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Church bells can be on timers
[2:53:43] <%ElenaManetta> The game full heals on death?
[2:53:43] <%cervidaequus> Bring back becky
[2:53:44] <OToole42> where are the zombies getting flaming weapons?
[2:53:46] <babo____> amazing game design
[2:53:46] <rcand9> really dumb
[2:53:49] <Run44forrest> ????
[2:53:51] <DrkJP520> lol
[2:53:52] <+Pyroclase> why are these anciety warrior mummies in a US graveyard???
[2:53:53] <lionandfox21> Die to come back stronger
[2:53:54] <natebud> just a bulletproof bdsm zombie
[2:53:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> Why did they shelter near a graveyard against a zombie virus
[2:53:58] <%SoFarFetched> @ElenaManetta yeah when you die,it reloads you to the checkpoint at full health.
[2:53:59] <%rytisone> that's a pro strat
[2:53:59] <%emperordread> Game Over (to heal) is a failure of the game design
[2:54:01] <%michingmallecho> We either suffer in RE6 or nothing. The spice must flow
[2:54:01] <Djinnazz> so many prompts
[2:54:02] <%SirGO0SE> REvolutionary
[2:54:03] <+ALazo> You're meant to lose so you can win
[2:54:04] <JonEWorldbeater> What is the actual difference between Helena & Jill or Claire? Is it nothing? 'Cuz it seems like nothing
[2:54:04] <Haruharuharuko> @pyroclase yes
[2:54:05] <crimsonsaens> Just don't get hit Kappa
[2:54:07] <derap41> its free healing not like you have to manage your inventory or anything
[2:54:07] <%ElenaManetta> SEE THAT'S THE THEME. You die, come back even stronger JUST LIKE RE CREATURES
[2:54:07] <Reise04> but game over is a failure of game design...
[2:54:10] <+Imperial_Madman> STOP RINGING THE DARN BELL
[2:54:11] <%ElenaManetta> W0AH, this game is so amazing
[2:54:11] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> do the RE Spin
[2:54:11] <+bestcup> that's the worst game design idea I've ever heard
[2:54:13] <%ElenaManetta> thematic even
[2:54:13] <xxdj1173xx> @patstaresat have you seen the terrible new doom eternal trailer?
[2:54:14] <%tusk102> fuck you
[2:54:14] <SlappyMeats> especially considering your performance is rated at the end of the level
[2:54:15] <%ssjklyco> I want to point out, that Leon and Helena have a "every one will die" field around them when they are near survivors.
[2:54:16] <oruandrew> why ring bell tho
[2:54:17] <+TheBitingIrish> Dude, I wish they had used the melee system for another game FeelsBadMan
[2:54:18] <%StrawberryPantsu> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

[3:02:20] <%Huntercd> This HUD sucks
[3:02:23] <myriad_truth> No, they want you to use the bombs
[3:02:23] <stranger59> Yeah, it's a brawler!

[3:02:43] <tigerfang86> TIRED
[3:02:44] <%Tenchi_G> And this is Normal difficulty too
[3:02:46] <ahbhajit> The reason these horde sections work in re4 is because you stock up on ammo first. In this, it's just constant hordes with no ammo
[3:02:47] <+vicar_anat> can't wait to see you play Operation Raccoon City
[3:02:48] <%luftraumm1> I dont remember not having any ammo in this part, aren't you supposed to kill everything in your path?

[3:26:56] <xeros720> you're better than garbage
[3:26:56] <%worldbrand> play cvx after this to be sure
[3:26:57] <%Agami23> this game being shit doesen't make cvx not shit
[3:26:57] <Heartless_01> wow, that looked bad
[3:26:57] <+Grayhammatter> yeah, this game seems pretty trash
[3:26:58] <natebud> @Th3SmartAlec less than no effort, it feels like effort went into making it terrible, it's that bad.
[3:26:58] <thebestestkevin> at least you're not playing ORC
[3:26:58] <+Owltosser> CVX <3
[3:26:58] <%Sklaveritter> But what about 0!?
[3:27:02] <nuane> @transporterthesequel every church has that, that's where they keep the choir boys
[3:27:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> Incest is Wincest according to Pat
[3:27:03] <%spiritofmojave> BEELY WINS
[3:27:03] <+Pyroclase> just wait until we get to the constant helicopter crashes
[3:27:04] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt And you'll believe that until you play it again
[3:27:05] <Dutchpotato> What about 0
[3:27:05] <%marsantas> Delay R3make until you finish this!

[3:27:16] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt shoot the screamers when they glow red in the neck. they die super fast but you always just shoot them in the back with the shotgun so it takes way longer
[3:27:16] <cesare92x> hold X when falling down when you get hit
[3:27:16] <tactician0> thats what I've been sayig
[3:27:21] <%professormorrigan> I think the rating is contingent on what game he's currently playing
[3:27:21] <+aversal_ammar> This game at least has fun co op
[3:27:23] <murilo182x> Mercenaries in RE6 is better than the whole CVX
[3:27:25] <biomegabear> STEVE WOULD BE A GOD SEND
[3:27:26] <%DedlokPM> Congrats CVX! You are no longer at the bottom of the barrel
[3:27:27] <+aversal_ammar> CVX has nothing
[3:27:27] <amused_platypus> At least its not Ride to Hell, thats the only good thing I could of
[3:27:30] <ahbhajit> now we force pat to play cvx so that he hates it worse than re6, than force him to play re6...

[3:40:37] <%Laecerelius> Helena is the fucking worst
[3:40:37] <%AwesomeDan_> why is leon helping her
[3:40:38] <AnacondaVirtue> Shoot Helena right now
[3:40:38] <%heartlesshealer> Ada-lite
[3:40:39] <jack_is_here> he said Ada like 7 times ofc he knows her helena jeez

[3:40:40] <tigerfang86> LITERALLY ALL OF THEM
[3:40:41] <ahbhajit> leon and ada have canonically fucked by this point, no?
[3:40:41] <BeefyQueefer> shoot her in the ass
[3:40:41] <Kemmybelle> is that why Leon won't get with Claire, cause he thinks thats how babies are made?
[3:40:42] <cesare92x> hold X when you get knocked down
[3:40:42] <+amazinglymarli> THAT'S WHAT I WAS PISSED AT
[3:40:43] <tolloponik> I FUCKED HER LITERALLY 3 WEEKS AGO!!!
[3:40:43] <%tank7013> @PatStaresAt She's trying to bait Leon into helping her save Deborah
[3:40:43] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> because bad writing. Suspense lol!
[3:40:44] <%tusk102> YEAH CUZ SHE SUCKS
[3:40:45] <Dao_Puppy> When you GET TO THE CHURCH
[3:40:45] <%cdrom321> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw The official modern medium of horror.
[3:40:45] <%Mister_McDerp> Leon can make a harem of Adas
[3:40:46] <stranger59> Leon is Helena's doormat
[3:40:46] <%worldbrand> Well she did answer "no" but then she refused to elaborate
[3:40:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> LEON IS SO DUMB
[3:40:47] <%rytisone> Cause it's not Revelations
[3:40:47] <%Niney_Who> "What's your name?" "Not now."
[3:40:48] <+Pyroclase> she tells you you'll get answers when you reach the cathedral and then just refuses to gibve them
[3:40:49] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt It's morbidly hilarious that Capcom kind of predicted a C-Virus would break out in China
[3:40:50] <MayorRev> Ada was an alien all along?
[3:40:52] <%Laecerelius> She seems so fucking evil right now
[3:40:53] <%heartlesshealer> yeah back out
[3:40:53] <myriad_truth> SHes supposed to be Secret Service right?
[3:40:53] <%YakumoYomi> But she's hot, tho...
[3:40:53] <alexandrecau> so that woman or whatever fuck you answer
[3:40:53] <rcand9> even leons bored
[3:40:54] <%ospreyworks> Ada being the focus of this game is really stupid. She’s a side character who pops up to string Leon along.
[3:40:56] <%rasterman> Sure have
[3:40:57] <IndoorSitup> Leon subs to Ada's Onlyfans.
[3:40:58] <%Agami23> helena refuses to answer, but asks leon a bunch and leon always answers
[3:40:58] <%SirGO0SE> she isnt even real enough for Capcom to give her a giant ass
[3:40:59] <Dutchpotato> No time
[3:41:00] <%Griffin1171> OH BOY, THIS GAME MECHANIC WE MADE SURE DOES SUCK
[3:41:01] <Reise04> Theres no time shut up
[3:41:02] <%StrawberryPantsu> THIS GAME WAS SO DUMB BUT SO COOL

[3:41:09] <%StrawberryPantsu> CORN BALL SHIT
[3:41:10] <derekwst3> she will only answer in the catheridal
[3:41:11] <%heartlesshealer> yea, cause those tubes have labels on them
[3:41:13] <natebud> Use emotes often, the voice lines change for some reason
[3:41:16] <%emperordread> It makes sense ADA = Ada Definitely Alien
[3:41:17] <%SWFanatic> Bleep Bloop

[3:41:28] <%bevyrage> that puzzle was as bad as bioshock infinite's bell puzzle
[3:41:29] <%SirGO0SE> @emperordread PogChamp
[3:41:29] <myriad_truth> Yeah, Chris wouldve made her talk.
[3:41:29] <IndoorSitup> IT WORKED
[3:41:31] <ha2ken> It WORKED!

[3:43:22] <ha2ken> They came from the vents
[3:43:24] <%Th3SmartAlec> I'M TURNING ON HELENA SO HARD RIGHT NOW
[3:43:25] <ammobasket> Wheels within wheels
[3:43:28] <%Agami23> why are there so many batman sized vents in this biolab?
[3:43:28] <%Huntercd> Mine too I forget this @PatStaresAt
[3:43:29] <MayorRev> wait so is Ada not human or was she cloned?
[3:43:34] <Hellarussian> this is goofy
[3:43:35] <ScreamLord> RE6 trying to be a worse Dead Space
[3:43:36] <Run44forrest> playing DDR with their heads
[3:43:37] <natebud> barfight leon
[3:43:38] <DrkJP520> Can you crawl in the vents?
[3:43:39] <%tusk102> @MayorRev shut up
[3:43:39] <+EkinRaider> @SirGO0SE ahh so RE7 is upcoming, thats cool
[3:43:39] <myriad_truth> Ada is a butterfly
[3:43:41] <%Th3SmartAlec> @MayorRev it's not Ada/
[3:43:43] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @MayorRev we'll find out later
[3:43:45] <usurper_sos> How did zombies know how to find these vents?
[3:43:46] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> or not
[3:43:47] <tiaramaki> @MayorRev You will find out
[3:43:48] <%Neo_Kaiser> Dead Space 3 is a worse Dead Space
[3:43:49] <cesare92x> try to counterattack them
[3:43:52] <TafferAA> you broke his bottle
[3:43:55] <shinelucid> if only you could walk in this game
[3:43:56] <usurper_sos> LUL
[3:43:58] <%Mister_McDerp> I hope Leon gets an army of Ada clones
[3:43:59] <%Laecerelius> Judo throw!
[3:44:01] <natebud> Irish whip that zombie
[3:44:02] <%heartlesshealer> sorta
[3:44:03] <tigerfang86> what dya think ofit
[3:44:04] <%Jaxnos> she died from sick judo flips
[3:44:04] <%SirGO0SE> vent-chan :(
[3:44:08] <myriad_truth> Dead Space 3 was still fun though!
[3:44:11] <+Grayhammatter> well, that was cool, too bad this game is trash
[3:44:12] <%tusk102> @Mister_McDerp and none of them will fuck him still
[3:44:12] <%heartlesshealer> bye helena
[3:44:12] <ammobasket> Madonna of Sandwiches
[3:44:17] <wrydiculous> im still trying to get over how that judo flip can kill the zombie
[3:44:18] <Satanael1> is Pat playing solo?
[3:44:18] <@commanderclaw> Helena Menetta
[3:44:20] <%Neo_Kaiser> Dead Space 3 sucks!
[3:44:23] <cesare92x> try counterattack saves you ammo and stamina
[3:44:24] <+Grayhammatter> WHAT?
[3:44:25] <Hellarussian> this is good
[3:44:25] <%Th3SmartAlec> ....
[3:44:28] <usurper_sos> Dead Space 3 was better than this
[3:44:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> GRAB CANCELS
[3:44:31] <Hellarussian> this is great
[3:44:32] <%Laecerelius> BWEEEEEEE@@
[3:44:32] <wrydiculous> fucking segata sanshiro couldn't even do that
[3:44:32] <digsby> Zombie knows CQC apparently
[3:44:33] <KingVantq> @PatStaresAt Dead Space 3 or RE6 LUL
[3:44:33] <%YakumoYomi> Madonna of McDonalds?
[3:44:36] <%tusk102> @Neo_Kaiser still better then this
[3:44:37] <%Th3SmartAlec> NICE
[3:44:37] <ironhorse92> And the vent was three days from retirement
[3:44:40] <T_Sasquatch> are QTEs the worst thing to happen to video game mechanics ?
[3:44:41] <Zuelis> I'd rather play dead space 3 than this garbage, dead space 3 was at least fun
[3:44:41] <Texascourierlive> Leon King of QTE
[3:44:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> THIS SHOTGUN IS BAD
[3:44:50] <rcand9> worst shotgun
[3:44:51] <myriad_truth> Dead Space 3 all the way. The Coop was fun in that
[3:44:53] <%Neo_Kaiser> Dead Space 3 demands payment for ammo.
[3:44:55] <%joylent_blue> Pat saying Helena so much must really confuse Elena
[3:44:58] <%heartlesshealer> that's why you were able to shoot dog
[3:45:01] <%Fatmanjoggin> Just remember, this is the good campaign
[3:45:07] <%InugamiTheHound> @usurper_sos yeah dead space had a action opening but it knew how to get back to it roots pretty quckly
[3:45:07] <%theo_marks> is he just doing Leons campaign?
[3:45:08] <usurper_sos> 3 DAYS
[3:45:12] <yungBarnac1e> @T_Sasquatch Without a doubt
[3:45:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> "What is this thing?"
[3:45:14] <myriad_truth> Chris's campaign is better
[3:45:14] <bxdragon> Where do they get the money to make these facilites?!
[3:45:15] <mydudefrightface> what is this room
[3:45:17] <tigerfang86> and EUROPE
[3:45:17] <MattDemers> I've covered WARS y'know.
[3:45:19] <%Mister_McDerp> the "good" campaign
[3:45:19] <+jiggy_snipe> and Spain
[3:45:19] <PabuPanda> Every single time Pat says Helena I think he's talking about Elena Manetta.

[3:45:35] <@ThePlotHole> Sick snapmare
[3:45:36] <%xcompleasedad> HOW IS THAT LETHAL???
[3:45:36] <%rytisone> Pat has changed from AngriestPat to PassiveAgressivePat
[3:45:37] <keyworthe> chris's campaign is just call of duty
[3:45:44] <myriad_truth> Leon needs to stop letting women boss him around
[3:45:45] <%Jaxnos> i love that judo flips are destroying zombies
[3:45:45] <usurper_sos> HAHA

[3:45:49] <NoHoldsBarredProductions> Big boomer Leon talking about the good old days
[3:45:50] <Reise04> SURVIVAL HORROR BTW
[3:45:51] <%SWFanatic> Zombie Splooge
[3:45:51] <%damienlunas> Oof ouchie

[3:46:01] <Deadbulky> Spit on me daddy
[3:46:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> Why are there so many zombies down here
[3:46:02] <%Mister_McDerp> YE
[3:46:03] <%crimsonharvest> The gunshot sound effect sounds bored
[3:46:03] <myriad_truth> At least Chris's campaign makes sense for the gameplay
[3:46:07] <digsby> One of the campaigns has a melee focus character right? How do they improve on shoot kick stomp?
[3:46:18] <+Grayhammatter> wow, it's like a shitty acid spitter from dead space
[3:46:18] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> But chris' campaign has Piers in it
[3:46:22] <%Jaxnos> you missed half those shots. cuz for some reason, the entire reticle is not the hit area, it's just the laser dot.
[3:46:31] <myriad_truth> I try
[3:46:34] <tigerfang86> you...... did it
[3:46:34] <Run44forrest> @PatStaresAt will you change your name back to AngriestPat by the end of this
[3:46:37] <T_Sasquatch> I'm going to need a "Wha' Happun" on RE6 because this is mind bllowing
[3:46:38] <murilo182x> It does not
[3:46:38] <%ssjklyco> Shoot box
[3:46:39] <%ElenaManetta> bite leon's dick, zombie girl
[3:46:39] <%linSP> BOULDER PUNCH
[3:46:39] <MattDemers> These zombos are great at the MMA double-leg takedown
[3:46:40] <+Pyroclase> TBH I kinda like the early parts of Chris's
[3:46:42] <Hellarussian> yep
[3:46:42] <+ssrdoki> @PatStaresAt he must be new
[3:46:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> These zombies are all trained wrestlers
[3:46:42] <seniortrump> piers is cute and leon not
[3:46:43] <stranger59> At least Chris just gets soldiers killed
[3:46:44] <+dmtjinni> what emote should i buy?
[3:46:47] <%trevsded> good game lol
[3:46:50] <usurper_sos> Still in it
[3:46:51] <Clu_Flynn> Leon's campaign is a cringefest get real
[3:46:53] <+Pyroclase> the big bioweapon setpieces were cool
[3:46:56] <Captain_Krunk> Good to know they cared enough for the roid freak
[3:46:56] <murilo182x> Chris' campaign has the least amount of ammo despite being the most action oriented one, it's stupid
[3:46:58] <GUNxSPECTRE> Yeah, because Chris' campaign has assault rifles and shit
[3:46:59] <%ShovelJustice21> I honestly feel the same way
[3:46:59] <Run44forrest> she just bro checked you
[3:47:00] <%heartlesshealer> did you pick up a spray?
[3:47:03] <%linSP> @dmtjinni psaDab
[3:47:03] <DrkJP520> The only thing this game is missing is mech.
[3:47:04] <%Rlexp> real question, do you think this level has a checkpoint?
[3:47:07] <Hellarussian> they made the good game
[3:47:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dmtjinni psaMenace
[3:47:08] <%SWFanatic> Zombies did nothing wrong
[3:47:10] <%tusk102> @GUNxSPECTRE so does leons?
[3:47:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> @stranger59 Leon is actively getting civilians killed becuase he's oncompetent
[3:47:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> helena, beat his ass off
[3:47:16] <eviljake9> I tuned in just in time to see Pat get to the part where I quit the game
[3:47:17] <%miguelrod777> psaGib
[3:47:17] <wrydiculous> yeah in retrospect, leon's campaign is terrible
[3:47:19] <%AnIcedCoffee> I don't remember the re5 shotgun being as bad as this one
[3:47:20] <GUNxSPECTRE> @tusk102 yeah later
[3:47:20] <IndoorSitup> Heal?
[3:47:21] <%joylent_blue> Chris's campaign is where all the fanfics come from

Then he yelled out that I was the one peeing and proceeded to try not to laugh while my mother beat me with a belt. When i yelled that he was the pisser, she refused to believe me. When my brother tells that story today, he can't stop laughing (he tells it often). Thanks big bro.
