[1:29:01] <+capnbeeb> awesome
[1:29:04] <%DedlokPM> Need time stop with your 6 sets of eyes
[1:29:04] <Dovakhin573> I hope the time stop meme comes back for the DMC5 playtrough
[1:29:11] <element_of_loyalty> Paige STAY AWAKE
[1:29:12] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Time stop, gotta get the time stop, time stop, gotta get the time stop
[1:29:13] <TheIronBrass> @umbypokochan Lol try the Path of Pain
[1:29:14] <arcadeking48> I am now imagining a Pat Morganna hybrid
[1:29:14] <Tisaric> White Palace is some of my favorite platforming
[1:29:15] <+DaRyeBeachHood> @angriestpat you can pogo off sideways spikes easily because the nail's hitbox is wider than the knights body so you only need to be kinda to the side of the spike and pogo hit
[1:29:19] <darthbatman72> i left is paige still butthurt about her being wrong
[1:29:19] <kvnmck94> mostly just the pantaloons
[1:29:24] <%ToadKing> you need time stop to make that jump
[1:29:27] <Tisaric> I love how brutal they made the game
[1:29:31] <CaptainJABRONIE> Yes! my first time catching Pat live!
[1:29:32] <Mine4Green1> hey pat you'll forget about this by the time you get there but watch your step after the mantis
[1:29:39] <@thenefftw> Look at these matching siblings
[1:29:39] <%vivecdidnothingwrong> NICE NICE NICE
[1:29:40] <+JayEarly> The fact that they went as far as to give the Knight a map reading animation is just incredible
[1:29:42] <%TheImmortal70> White palace is impressive
[1:29:42] <element_of_loyalty> KNOW OH
[1:29:44] <+Grayhammatter> jesus christ
[1:29:45] <%Jpdodds> grabpoids
[1:29:48] <%TheImmortal70> I'll say that
[1:29:48] <cerberuscarmine> pffff
[1:29:54] <%Jpdodds> graboids
[1:29:55] <@SSaryn> Stealing each others pants is basically just as good as stealing each others food. They're 2 great tastes and taste great together.
[1:29:57] <OwlLightningMage> I can't wait for Pat to drop this game Kappa
[1:29:59] <TheIronBrass> NOTHING I COULD DO
[1:30:05] <%vivecdidnothingwrong> You really don't need it though
[1:30:06] <element_of_loyalty> LOOK HOW BIG PATS ____ IS
[1:30:07] <%korth367> when will confidence go away
[1:30:07] <+TeethMuncher> @th3madness white palace and it's secret are a fuck
[1:30:09] <sponsoredviewer910> DSPat
[1:30:10] <Tisaric> There's a ton of passion in the animations for the Knight, it's amazing how much personality they put in
[1:30:10] <$Mendin> The various enemy and NPC voice mumbles are recorded by the actual studio staff and/or their immediate family, which adds a cute element
[1:30:11] <%DedlokPM> It helps to have a map. teenJOY
[1:30:14] <%vivecdidnothingwrong> Just watch for landmarks
[1:30:19] <$magikestral> remember that there's a bench at the stag station, you may want to buy the map markers to remember that
[1:30:23] <pennykettle_> Why have two pairs of pajamas when you could get a tube you put your legs in opposite sides of
[1:30:27] <@thenefftw> @SSaryn Steal someone's food while wearing their pants
[1:30:28] <+london0> thats the beetle

[2:23:55] <ragasquid> greenpath's theme is so relaxing
[2:23:58] <Parapattern> Tarantula's keep tiny frogs as pets to guard their eggs from pests. That fact seems like it would fit snugly in this world.
[2:24:03] <+Dragon4234> Pat drop your nail
[2:24:04] <Gorgen> !game
[2:24:06] <vinnybushes> @AngriestPat the lore for this game is ludicrously deep
[2:24:10] <prismaticsnake> its cute, dont kill
[2:24:13] <IndoorSitup> so why is everything made of orange soda?
[2:24:18] <ArcanumMBD> Pat is being outsmarted by a small bug
[2:24:21] <+Garrosh_Heckscream> It's orange disease
[2:24:22] <$Totally_not_toby> buffalo sauce
[2:24:25] <pennykettle_> @IndoorSitup lore
[2:24:26] <ragasquid> its lcl
[2:24:30] <%BioApple> soda is notoriously hazardous to bugs
[2:24:30] <Big_King_Coconut> bug waifu
[2:24:32] <Rostichenburg> Anything that pops in orange is infected
[2:24:36] <+gantz_zero> @IndoorSitup bug joos
[2:24:36] <nepwar> yeyeye
[2:24:36] <$Totally_not_toby> bugs love hooters hot sauce
[2:24:41] <+S3XYG4MS> @ragasquid thats fuckied up if true
[2:24:43] <$Mendin> Fanta
[2:24:44] <$Totally_not_toby> they store it up
[2:24:45] <%QueequegTheater> LUCATIEL COME BACK
[2:24:45] <drfaustisdead> It's okay Pat, with those short little legs we know you'd be bad at jumping.
[2:24:46] <+Dragon4234> @vinnybushes I dunno man it all seems pretty small like a bug to me
[2:24:48] <DSD24> Is it a good idea to follow rival characters?
[2:24:50] <%SuperCasualBoom> They spewing the Donald Trump racist tan
[2:24:53] <+nolifegamin> it seems like you're able to heal quite frequently in this game, interesting
[2:24:54] <AlchemiBeast> who knows
[2:25:10] <Rostichenburg> Did Pat find the shopkeep?
[2:25:10] <ragasquid> big if true
[2:25:15] <vinnybushes> @Dragon4234 got me there
[2:25:15] <$Totally_not_toby> lmao i got to [area] way before i ever went through greenpath
[2:25:19] <+S3XYG4MS> :)
[2:25:19] <Parapattern> Bugs are made of pumpkin spice
[2:25:20] <$magikestral> but so are spells
[2:25:24] <+Grayhammatter> the only limit to healing is how fast you can do it
[2:25:28] <Tisaric> just wait until you're in a boss fight then
[2:25:31] <$Totally_not_toby> i'm just now realizing this is definitely the intended path
[2:25:35] <%BioApple> The healing system is good because the map is so huge that anything less would KILL the pacing
[2:25:36] <RedPlasticCup> has Pat died at atll?
[2:25:36] <%QueequegTheater> @Rostichenburg you mean the HOT BUG WIFE
[2:25:39] <%SteveTheGhost> Healing can get pretty broken with the right charm setup.
[2:25:40] <+ChrisTheRedBeard> what a cute little game
[2:25:42] <%QueequegTheater> @RedPlasticCup once
[2:25:45] <vinnybushes> @RedPlasticCup once
[2:25:47] <RedPlasticCup> aha
[2:25:58] <Gorgen> God this game is charming
[2:26:00] <nepwar> dying probably feels like cheap since healing is so readily available if you play gud
[2:26:02] <MattDemers> I just wanna see Pat get to the next zone
[2:26:03] <$Totally_not_toby> buy your checkpoints you wagecuck
[2:26:08] <pennykettle_> I think this game has one of my favourite tropes ever which no one ever does. Warframe barely does it and Dark Souls 2 almost did it
[2:26:11] <Tisaric> They fuck with the benches so much
[2:26:13] <Tisaric> It's great

[2:27:41] <+nolifegamin> @pennykettle_ it was the first DS I beaten, but I still liked DS1 better, I still agree it had potential though

[2:28:07] <+Shigakure94> Yes cappuccino
[2:28:07] <%QueequegTheater> @grayjammer doesn't understand what "objectively" means
[2:28:08] <%BioApple> @CappuccinoGuil it's mostly tone
[2:28:09] <+Shigakure94> is accurate
[2:28:09] <Endocrom> I love that your weapon is just a nail
[2:28:12] <pennykettle_> Sure is

[2:28:31] <Parapattern> What adventure game these days doesn't have Souls elements?
[2:28:35] <grayjammer> @QueequegTheater I do, im just being a shit
[2:28:36] <$Totally_not_toby> @ape_hawk actually he's good at the game and has not gotten any amount of blown out yet
[2:28:37] <TalisKanju> Will Pat finish Hollow Knight?

[2:29:42] <StencilOST> parries and clashes
[2:29:42] <pennykettle_> @BioApple Matt and Woolie had it in their demo of the game. Sometimes youd just autowalk when trying to move a direction. I dont remember any settings changes helping
[2:29:45] <Parapattern> Poor buggy boi

[2:29:50] <pennykettle_> @BioApple I never beat the trial of fools because of it

[2:31:51] <%Divryne> Hey look it's Pat.
[2:31:51] <Tisaric> the fucking lautrec of hollow knight
[2:32:01] <$Totally_not_toby> :( i don't like that
[2:32:04] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat It's okay he's kind fo a cunt
[2:32:06] <Rostichenburg> It cuts his storyline short though
[2:32:06] <CappuccinoGuil> Is this Anor Londo?
[2:32:07] <IndoorSitup> so draw your nail already you COWARD
[2:32:11] <+Grayhammatter> yeah, it's pretty fucked
[2:32:11] <vinnybushes> @AngriestPat if he dies it also locks you out of something waaaaaaaay later
[2:32:13] <Big_King_Coconut> Zote did nothing wrong
[2:32:20] <pennykettle_> nah hes not a lautrec, I cant quite pin his similarity
[2:32:21] <dekkitout> "The Life-ender?" thats like calling your horse "The Place-goer"
[2:32:23] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Is this the Crash Bandicoot of Platformers?
[2:32:28] <Parapattern> Is this Anor Londo for ANTS???!
[2:32:36] <bryanmildew> id name a horse placegoer tbh
[2:32:39] <$Totally_not_toby> this is my shield, the stuff-stopper
[2:32:41] <kwangalang> ofcourse something that random can lock you out

[2:33:03] <TalisKanju> @Mendin Ok, I get it, thanks for the explanation
[2:33:08] <+Shigakure94> I bet
[2:33:09] <+Shigakure94> he is going to die now
[2:33:12] <+Shigakure94> how much you wanna bet
[2:33:16] <%QueequegTheater> @MyNameIsRasus Siegward sucks, Siegmeyer is the non-shitty one
[2:33:26] <vinnybushes> @AngriestPat that gap is for later
[2:33:27] <kwangalang> LUL
[2:33:29] <StencilOST> time stop
[2:33:29] <Tisaric> you can't get through that right now
[2:33:29] <MyNameIsRasus> @queequegtheater you ain't wrong
[2:33:30] <gunstar73> you need dash to do
[2:33:34] <Tisaric> time stop
[2:33:34] <SatansDick1> not yet
[2:33:34] <Daniel_Is_I> You need a metroid to vania
[2:33:35] <prettypatties97> Welp, I vote that we give up
[2:33:38] <nepwar> pat no
[2:33:40] <+Grayhammatter> time stop
[2:33:40] <hiddenllama4> you need the dash move
[2:33:41] <ShawnEXE> can't get there yet
[2:33:41] <$Mendin> Siegward is a little more bumbling but is also jolly and pot ent
[2:33:42] <%BioApple> y cant hollow knight crawl
[2:33:43] <Caidezes> Time stop.
[2:33:43] <+yetionayacht> need time stop
[2:33:45] <gunstar73> team cherry made it so you cant cheese
[2:33:45] <MyNameIsRasus> Time stop
[2:33:45] <$Totally_not_toby> you need time stop smh
[2:33:46] <%xemnahort> you need an ability for that
[2:33:47] <pennykettle_> nah just long tippy toes
[2:33:51] <+JustToWatch> @angriestpat you get dash very soon
[2:33:53] <Gorgen> Za warudo?
[2:34:00] <pennykettle_> stop spoiling you hacks
[2:34:02] <MyNameIsRasus> TOKI WO TOMARE
[2:34:02] <Rostichenburg> How come Pat isn't waiting for Gods and Glory now?
[2:34:05] <Tisaric> remember not to barely heal it wasts soul
[2:34:08] <Weeabooninja> You can hit stalactites before they hit you to shoot them off
[2:34:12] <vinnybushes> left side of this area has a way out
[2:34:14] <Weeabooninja> as a projectile
[2:34:14] <+nolifegamin> Hollow Knight vs Shovel Knight, who would win?
[2:34:15] <+Marchen144> @AngriestPat yay Hollow Knight.
[2:34:15] <%QueequegTheater> @Mendin except that aside from the very first encounter he's just "Member Siegmeyer"
[2:34:16] <$Totally_not_toby> don't worry pat you get the teleport really soon Kappa
[2:34:20] <ShawnEXE> God's and glory isn't a main story necessity
[2:34:20] <+Shigakure94> hollow knight by far
[2:34:22] <%xemnahort> @AngriestPat not finishing a heal doesn't refund the soul used
[2:34:23] <+Shigakure94> at least in my opinion
[2:34:25] <pennykettle_> @nolifegamin shovel knight
[2:34:35] <+gantz_zero> @QueequegTheater yeah but Sieglinde
[2:34:42] <%cerass> can we not shout out spoilers?
[2:34:45] <%BioApple> I bet G&G will come out before he finishes
[2:34:46] <pennykettle_> %
[2:34:51] <TalisKanju> Shovel Knight would eat dirt in that fight.
[2:34:54] <xeros720> he needs to be prepared for the time stop power
[2:34:56] <+VoxelFoxTwitch> Fuck yeah! Finally pat!
[2:35:00] <+Shigakure94> I agree with @TalisKanju
[2:35:00] <%QueequegTheater> @gantz_zero well yeah, she's not even undead and gets to Ash Lake from fucking Crystal Cave
[2:35:01] <Kghaleon> This is definitely better than Salt and sanctuary
[2:35:09] <+Shigakure94> @Kghaleon a million times better
[2:35:15] <Parapattern> He's just a little boy!
[2:35:17] <DSD24> Salt and Sanctuary is still pretty good though
[2:35:17] <MyNameIsRasus> Rosebud kills Dumbledore
[2:35:18] <nepwar> i forgot salt and sanctuary existed
[2:35:23] <$Mendin> Salt & Sanctuary had potential but mechanically just was... off... in a lot of ways
[2:35:27] <Tisaric> The haduken is really good against those
[2:35:31] <nepwar> i wonder what the end looks like
[2:35:34] <%xemnahort> @BioApple for sure he'll never even reach the royal waterways in time
[2:35:34] <%BioApple> THE DREAM, HUNTER
[2:35:40] <Rhinoprotoss> Salt and sanctuary looks pretty bad and wasn't that creative
[2:35:40] <Gorgen> crikLore
[2:35:41] <cerberuscarmine> i dont like the art style of salt
[2:35:43] <xeros720> i was gonna say, i liked salt and sanctuary a lot, but this is a lot more polished
[2:35:46] <+VoxelFoxTwitch> I couldnt stand the art style of salt and sanc
[2:35:46] <MyNameIsRasus> I quite like Dandara, honestly
[2:35:46] <+nolifegamin> @Shigakure94 @pennykettle_ @TalisKanju seems like Hollow Knight is the winner: 2 to 1
[2:35:47] <kwangalang> Wasnt salt and sanctuary made by just 2 people ?
[2:35:47] <cerberuscarmine> its bleh
[2:35:48] <Parapattern> Salt & Sanctuary's biggest flaw was it's crummy art style
[2:35:50] <DSD24> @nepwar The Final Boss in that game was pretty cool
[2:35:52] <+Walopoh> PAT HEAL
[2:35:59] <FrustratedAF> !uptime
[2:35:59] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 36m 1s.
[2:36:01] <Tisaric> Hollow Knight was a super small team too
[2:36:01] <Big_King_Coconut> the jukes
[2:36:02] <reonome> yeah it was made by 2 people
[2:36:02] <+Shigakure94> @kwangalang this game was made by two people as well
[2:36:07] <Rostichenburg> Does anyone like the art style of Salt and Sanctuary
[2:36:09] <+Shigakure94> technically 3
[2:36:09] <cerberuscarmine> yay
[2:36:10] <IminyourBase> i think that one said "elmo"
[2:36:12] <%QueequegTheater> I might be the only one who loves S&S's art style
[2:36:17] <DSD24> @Rostichenburg I thought it was fine
[2:36:19] <xeros720> you pretty much need to slap on a full set of armor as soon as possible in Salt and Sanctuary, the default sprites are just awful
[2:36:19] <prettypatties97> Those Caterpie's are the best
[2:36:19] <$Mendin> Salt & Sanctuary was also the first soulslike out at a time between souls games so it has slight nostalgia-stockholm
[2:36:21] <reonome> S&S is uggo
[2:36:24] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I think they got an extra dude or two for hollow knight, so it's like four or five people for this
[2:36:28] <+nolifegamin> holy shit this was made by two people? fuck that's amazing
[2:36:29] <DraxTD> did elmo pass out next to pat?
[2:36:31] <%xemnahort> @AngriestPat bit of advice don't get too close to the grubs?
[2:36:32] <+Marchen144> @AngriestPat they had a indiebox edition of this game that came with a plushie of them.
[2:36:33] <Kghaleon> There's an invaluable item you get for rescuing the grubs later
[2:36:33] <pennykettle_> @nolifegamin hollow knight is a bug with a nail, hes underdog who overcomes odds. shovel knight is a badass, who digs dirt; the entire home of hollow knight
[2:36:34] <CappuccinoGuil> S&S has like... okay style at best, but it's pretty fun to play
[2:36:34] <+Shigakure94> they only got an extra one
[2:36:38] <nepwar> @DSD24 thats good to hear, couldn't get past the mechanics to play al the way through
[2:36:50] <Parapattern> I spy a small slice of Elmo in the corner
[2:36:51] <dawnengel> i love this music
[2:36:52] <%BioApple> S&S's major flaw is it has scribblenauts paper doll animation in a genre where animation is super important
[2:36:55] <+Grayhammatter> the jukes!
[2:36:57] <+nolifegamin> I kinda feel bad now for thinking, "Man this game looks good but the graphics could use a bit more "oomph"
[2:36:58] <7thnightingale> y no parry?
[2:36:59] <Baconrath> nerf footsies
[2:37:02] <Shastafield> PogChamp
[2:37:12] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat it'd be such a shame if you lost all that money...
[2:37:14] <$Totally_not_toby> the parry is fucking rough in this game lmao
[2:37:14] <Rostichenburg> Good to know I just couldn't get into it for that
[2:37:18] <MyNameIsRasus> it would be a shame if he died Kappa
[2:37:19] <grayjammer> elmo...
[2:37:22] <DSD24> @nepwar Plus I really liked the ending I got it ties back to what creed you picked
[2:37:27] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> You sorta can parry, but it's not something the game ever really needs you to know
[2:37:30] <gunstar73> parry is super worthless
[2:37:33] <+gantz_zero> Salt & Sanc is irrelevant with Death's Gambit out TODAY
[2:37:33] <Tisaric> I think they just contracted the composer, the rest was 2 guts
[2:37:40] <$magikestral> i didn't even know this game had a parry until i accidentally did it enough times
[2:37:42] <gunstar73> it looks that's about it
[2:37:45] <Rostichenburg> Don't worry Pat you only need 1000 more for the lamp
[2:37:45] <$Totally_not_toby> chaaaaat! don't activate crazy talk like that :(
[2:37:49] <CappuccinoGuil> oh yeah, Death's Gambit is also a souls like,
[2:37:52] <CappuccinoGuil> right?
[2:37:53] <%QueequegTheater> see look, he just parried that dude's face
[2:38:01] <Tisaric> He's a good boi
[2:38:03] <Big_King_Coconut> Holloboi
[2:38:05] <Kghaleon> I lost my first S&S run because of a glitch. -_-
[2:38:06] <Rostichenburg> Stag station sign
[2:38:06] <$Totally_not_toby> GO SEE STAG BRO
[2:38:09] <DSD24> The Knight is pretty cute
[2:38:10] <$Totally_not_toby> NOOOOO
[2:38:10] <Midnight188> Crazy Talk will active whether we want it to or not
[2:38:10] <MyNameIsRasus> Hollowmin
[2:38:11] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Death's Gambit is like the next notch over on dark souls to metroidvania than this
[2:38:12] <ValidVenasaur> stagway thata way
[2:38:14] <+TeethMuncher> Fukc that sign LUL
[2:38:14] <nepwar> @DSD24 oh nice. that's pretty neat
[2:38:15] <%xemnahort> follow that sign @AngriestPat
[2:38:15] <+gantz_zero> yep, Death's Gambit is soulsvania @CappuccinoGuil
[2:38:16] <Midnight188> thats just how Crazy Tak be
[2:38:16] <BakerBrute> He cut the stag sign down
[2:38:18] <$magikestral> pat that sign told you important info
[2:38:18] <+Puppet88> bench
[2:38:18] <prettypatties97> Just breaking signs, like some kind of delinquent
[2:38:22] <+nolifegamin> @pennykettle_ you strike a good bargain there sir, Shovel Knight wins in our hearts
[2:38:24] <+Grayhammatter> this li'l hollowmin
[2:38:26] <BakerBrute> rude
[2:38:27] <Parapattern> I keep expecting the characters to break out into a rendition of "This is Halloween"
[2:38:28] <Tisaric> There's a ton of shortcut porn in here
[2:38:28] <$Totally_not_toby> :)
[2:38:32] <%QueequegTheater> @Kghaleon if you do another, just go strength. The game is super unbalanced and every other build is pretty bad
[2:38:40] <CappuccinoGuil> @gantz_zero please, stop saying such sweet yet seductive things to me or I might fall in love
[2:38:43] <vinnybushes> @AngriestPat he has different dialogue for each area
[2:38:43] <MyNameIsRasus> Soulsvania sounds like the genre that makes the most sense in retrospect
[2:38:44] <CharileMurphyPendelton> @q@hunk_of_dunk yes thank you for giving a dayum :)
[2:38:46] <CappuccinoGuil> hmmmm soulsvania
[2:38:49] <Big_King_Coconut> KONO GEO DA
[2:38:50] <BakerBrute> Stag chats about new areas
[2:38:57] <+gantz_zero> @CappuccinoGuil ;)
[2:39:04] <DSD24> The Stag is pretty cute too
[2:39:17] <Parapattern> A Big Lad
[2:39:22] <TalisKanju> It's weird when the shoopuf talks
[2:39:23] <%QueequegTheater> look at that good oldboi
[2:39:30] <vinnybushes> the stag is a sexy grandpa for sure
[2:39:33] <+Grayhammatter> ride ze shoopuff?
[2:39:36] <CappuccinoGuil> in awe at the size of this lad
[2:39:37] <$Totally_not_toby> stag grandpa is my best friend
[2:39:38] <+TeethMuncher> Go see a doctor if you have dirt mouth
[2:39:44] <Baconrath> foxy grandpa PogChamp
[2:39:46] <+nolifegamin> yea Soulsvania isn't a bad way to put it
[2:39:51] <%QueequegTheater> Not quite bug but not quite clothing
[2:39:54] <kwangalang> i feel like any game described as dark souls does a massive disservice to it
[2:39:54] <DSD24> Something inbetween
[2:39:55] <+Vestillion> His silly waggly legs.
[2:39:57] <+Puppet88> GIFL stag KappaHD
[2:39:59] <Tisaric> Elderbug will have new dialogue for each boss I think
[2:39:59] <$Totally_not_toby> stinky stink lines in the swamp
[2:39:59] <%BioApple> I call it a side-souler
[2:40:01] <%QueequegTheater> BAFANADA
[2:40:02] <Rostichenburg> Pat you gotta finish exploring the crossroads
[2:40:02] <pennykettle_> @kwangalang agreed

[2:41:12] <+nolifegamin> Zote: "Yo dog I just went and beat Sonicfox in a money match, what did you do?"
[2:41:16] <%Divryne> He stole credit from you saving him.
[2:41:17] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat and Zote the Mighty. It's like poetry, it rhymes
[2:41:18] <reonome> @Picabunny you're late

[2:41:19] <vinnybushes> @AngriestPat you might wanna look at the crossroads again real quick
[2:41:27] <+TeethMuncher> Zote is a bottom tier bitch
[2:41:30] <nepwar> zote backwards spells pat.
[2:41:31] <CappuccinoGuil> ooooh Paige is back? yay!
[2:41:35] <Hydrapissed> Zote is GOD
[2:41:36] <Tisaric> Yeah you should probably finish up the crossroads
[2:41:37] <pennykettle_> no backseat pls
[2:41:51] <Rostichenburg> @AngriestPat Important stuff in the crossroads
[2:41:53] <ArcanumMBD> dont backseat
[2:41:54] <$magikestral> no backseating y'all, even if he didn't 100% that place

[2:46:09] <Kghaleon> The geo magnet is invaluable if he can find it
[2:46:10] <MyNameIsRasus> This game kinda reminds of An Elysian Tale
[2:46:12] <Daniel_Is_I> @prettypatties97 Well his only death so far was to a lake so...
[2:46:13] <$Jayschroo> can you dash upwards
[2:46:13] <%Ninestempest> still sad that HK isn't in rivals of aether

[2:46:36] <californaya> I did the exact same thing, lol
[2:46:36] <prettypatties97> @Daniel_Is_I So what you're saying is that the lake is the final boss?
[2:46:36] <+BurncoatRapscallion> I thought the same thing
[2:46:38] <+nolifegamin> @MyNameIsRasus that's funny cuz Elysian Tale is made by 1 person, this game by 2
[2:46:39] <Pointdot> Poor guy was just chillin

[2:48:58] <$Mendin> Pat's One Weakness: ACID LAKES
[2:49:00] <Daniel_Is_I> I think he's taken more damage from water than anything else
[2:49:00] <CharileMurphyPendelton> @nolifegamin really i.though it was Jojo references all day er day :\
[2:49:00] <irocc500> lol
[2:49:02] <crimsonharvest> what a HERO
[2:49:03] <%SuperCasualBoom> Pat man can‚Äôt dash
[2:49:04] <drfaustisdead> you were going to say bad at video games right?
[2:49:06] <Big_King_Coconut> I'm a professor! Why is no one listening to me? LAVA HOT!!
[2:49:08] <pede2011> 1 SHOTS BOSSES, CANT DO BASIC PLATFORMING
[2:49:08] <%xemnahort> dig up stupid
[2:49:10] <grayjammer> Pat Hates Drowning
[2:49:13] <CharileMurphyPendelton> I thought *
[2:49:24] <gunstar73> remember to hit walls for worm bros
[2:49:26] <%xemnahort> I feel better about pat one shotting hornet now
[2:49:26] <Rostichenburg> It's acid so it's more melting
[2:49:26] <OkamiDude15> Patrick your age is showing woopsS I joke of course woopsGottem
[2:49:28] <+nolifegamin> @CharileMurphyPendelton I expect that to be the norm here really
[2:49:29] <+DaRyeBeachHood> [CRAZY TALK REQUIEM]
[2:49:31] <pennykettle_> platforming as good as that one cuphead reviewer
[2:49:40] <vinnybushes> man I feel even dumber about backseating once I remember how good this game's level design is
[2:49:40] <%cerass> is eldescrolls online any good?
[2:49:46] <+yetionayacht> previous paths have probably opened up ü§î
[2:49:47] <SatansDick1> no
[2:49:47] <CharileMurphyPendelton> @nolifegamin lol pretty much so
[2:49:47] <marylittle5657> do not go left
[2:49:50] <+DakotaChip> no
[2:49:51] <%QueequegTheater> it's an MMO, so no.
[2:49:55] <MyNameIsRasus> Hey Pat member that time you spent twenty minutes on that staircase on DSe because you didn't look left?
[2:49:57] <Kghaleon> Better to view the full map
[2:49:57] <$magikestral> you can go to many new places with that dash, like that path above in the not-crossroads
[2:50:03] <Tisaric> It's amazing how well they point you in the right direction
[2:50:05] <AlchemiBeast> it hurts seeing pat be so much better at the bosses than me, then proceeding to fall into the same acid pit 3 times
[2:50:06] <ArrogantPrimate> epic chest ahead?
[2:50:07] <%xemnahort> correct answer is neither you want to go down and to the right
[2:50:08] <+TeethMuncher> @vinnybushes there are some moments where it just fucks you though
[2:50:13] <+DaRyeBeachHood> Elder Scrolls Online <<< FFXIV
[2:50:21] <DracusOmega> @AngriestPat why is pat so gud at fighting needle lady but no dashes
[2:50:21] <+DakotaChip> WoW was good until cataclysm.
[2:50:23] <gunstar73> if pat beats this charm fight hes actually a god
[2:50:24] <+Shigakure94> i think he might die here
[2:50:36] <vinnybushes> @TeethMuncher sure but better to let that happen organically than because my dumb ass said not to
[2:50:36] <$Mendin> This reminds me of that one brief piece of Super Metroid outside/around the crashed ship area
[2:50:36] <+DakotaChip> Mists of Pandaria was pretty good and thicc panda girls fueled my furry lust.
[2:50:41] <Tisaric> Using the pogo is one of the best combat methods
[2:50:50] <CharileMurphyPendelton> @daryebeachhood but but Maplestory tho?
[2:50:52] <+yetionayacht> he's just sitting on a couch playing video games, how's he gonna die
[2:50:53] <+Shigakure94> yeah, master pogo for sure
[2:50:54] <$Jayschroo> this place spooky
[2:50:55] <%Fenrirlives> funny I was just thinking bout that Richter quote
[2:50:58] <+FrostedZaibatsu> I watched the Shovel Knight playthrough today too
[2:51:01] <zettig> IIRC you can pogo off the spikes, right?
[2:51:02] <$Mendin> Shoutouts to the OG Pogo Magnate: Uncle Scrooge

[2:57:45] <Huntercd> Would Paige be better at this game?
[2:57:47] <pennykettle_> I think one of the design flaws of this game is you cant ignore your dropped items like DS bloodstains. if you want your full soul meter back you have to kill yourself near a bench and then reclaim
[2:57:49] <prettypatties97> Your concern is appreciated
[2:57:50] <KnivesEve> oh will pat be playing this more?

[2:58:22] <+DaRyeBeachHood> The flower isn't that hard to deliver...
[2:58:29] <Rostichenburg> There's an NPC that undoes death status but I never bothered using him
[2:58:33] <%xemnahort> @pede2011 yup
[2:58:39] <+DakotaChip> lobosGasm this game so good
[2:58:42] <+Tapt58> Bought my first arcade stick this week, gonna try getting into fighting games after years of influence from the zaibatsu, thanks @angriestpat
[2:58:42] <%BioApple> @pennykettle_ Yeah, I think the corpse run goes against the standard Metroidvania exploration system, though in practice I never had much of a problem with it
[2:58:45] <%psychodave1234> been meaning to get this game, how is it?
[2:58:46] <Kghaleon> Steamworld dig 2's secret dungeon is a nightmare
[2:58:54] <grayjammer> The flower's okay if you know the route and clear it out beforehand
[2:58:58] <Caidezes> Pat's losing it live on stream.

[3:02:29] <MyNameIsRasus> Didn't do it good tho
[3:02:29] <Kaneis> You get a ton of money later in the game -- don't sweat it
[3:02:32] <DaGodKira> WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS PATRICK
[3:02:32] <+nolifegamin> it's not a super easy jump, it's k Pat
[3:02:33] <+yetionayacht> you were tilted :(
[3:02:34] <californaya> you can't jump out of dash, no
[3:02:34] <prettypatties97> Time to go practice that jump for the next 20 minutes, it's the only way
[3:02:36] <Caidezes> Well, now you're broke.
[3:02:38] <%Ninestempest> there isn't a "you can jump for a few frames after you go off a ledge" in HK
[3:02:40] <ValidVenasaur> you kept hitting the ceiling because you didnt jump at the edge
[3:02:46] <damienlunas> It's okay Pat you're still wonderful and you brighten up our day.
[3:02:47] <californaya> you can jump after dash, but not cancel out
[3:02:49] <%Linearlinera> he sounds so sad BibleThump
[3:02:53] <grayjammer> Pat you're tilting
[3:03:00] <MyNameIsRasus> Die to something close so you can get your meter back
[3:03:06] <+yetionayacht> 600 aint that much
[3:03:07] <DaGodKira> ***
[3:03:07] <+Spikyshrike> You'll earn it back soon
[3:03:08] <%xemnahort> pat has almost reached the point where he gets worse out of frustration
[3:03:13] <prettypatties97> I haven't played the game so I can't tell how much of the chat is just shitposting or not
[3:03:13] <%SuperCasualBoom> Pat have officially hollowed out...
[3:03:17] <DaGodKira> oh no clips in chat forgot
[3:03:21] <vinnybushes> @AngriestPat I mean at this point there's no reason to not practice that jump
[3:03:21] <$eddi401> soup boivin
[3:03:29] <Kaneis> It's fine you'll get it back in no time
[3:03:30] <+demoncleanr> Its tough in this game
[3:03:34] <+JustToWatch> it's OK, 600 Geo is literally nothing
[3:03:34] <+solipants> 600 geo comes quick, this is early game yet no worries
[3:03:35] <MyNameIsRasus> You already have like8%
[3:03:35] <ValidVenasaur> tbh it you get a ton of geo
[3:03:36] <%Divryne> It's fine Pat 600 is a drop in the bucket.
[3:03:36] <arcadeking48> It is like Dark Souls in the sense that it doesnt matter. You can earn that money back, and then some
[3:03:36] <%commanderclaw> "You'll lose your geo, again and again"
[3:03:38] <+MetaSla> @AngriestPat bouncing on the spikes also resets your dash
[3:03:39] <knomad2b> i remember loosing 3000 geo one and becoming overcome with rage
[3:03:41] <Polengoldur> @AngriestPat have you played Momodora Reverie Under The Moonlight? if you like Hollow Knight im sure you'd like momo
[3:03:41] <Rostichenburg> @AngriestPat If you double tap L you can bring up the full map
[3:03:42] <+BruceyG> By the end of the game you're literally rolling in geo
[3:03:47] <+BurncoatRapscallion> There's places in this game where you can gain more than that
[3:03:50] <vinnybushes> yeah 600 becomes nothing later
[3:03:56] <grayjammer> Geo's easy to come by later on. Don't worry yourself too bad about it
[3:03:58] <%psychodave1234> BY THE WAY PAT. super excited for banner saga. ive been chipping away at that for a bit
[3:04:01] <damienlunas> @AngriestPat 600's nothing in the long run. It's not nearly as big a deal as losing your souls.
[3:04:02] <%xemnahort> @solipants shh he needs to feel bad to feel good later
[3:04:02] <marylittle5657> @AngriestPat you could go back to grubfather for some more geo
[3:04:04] <xeros720> Elmo, give Pat strength
[3:04:11] <+nolifegamin> @arcadeking48 yea I learned that outside of extreme cases, losing "souls" never really matters
[3:04:13] <prettypatties97> For some reason I thought Elmo was making that noise, I think I may be tired
[3:04:15] <ValidVenasaur> why?
[3:04:17] <+trnzero> RIP
[3:04:17] <Weeabooninja> Dig up
[3:04:18] <$Mendin> Pat you just did the Hollow Knight equivalent of losing like 10k souls for the first time in Undead Parish

[3:05:18] <irocc500> well done
[3:05:19] <prettypatties97> I think Paige and the shadow puzzle might still be the worst
[3:05:19] <%Divryne> Crossroads probably.
[3:05:21] <knomad2b> that pressure cracked you
[3:05:25] <+trnzero> The voice of a broken man
[3:05:26] <29vigilanthand> Hey Pat, its alright.
[3:05:28] <%BioApple> this game needs bug invasions to cripple pat even harder
[3:05:32] <$Totally_not_toby> pat's been too good at the game and now the universe is balancing it all out
[3:05:41] <@SSaryn> Pat confirmed bad at platforming.
[3:05:43] <%xemnahort> I forget where the drop attack is
[3:05:43] <GMAN_SECTOR> Pat machine broke
[3:05:43] <Big_King_Coconut> "might as well explore that bottom" Pat, 2018
[3:05:46] <vinnybushes> it's soulsbornevania it's part of the territory my dude
[3:05:47] <grayjammer> Oh man hes gonna love WP
[3:05:49] <KahtaLzargo> ;) ;p
[3:05:51] <$Mendin> You will never meet the King with a soul so frail and pallid. Bearer of the curse, seek adversity.
[3:05:53] <nzrai> it really do be like that
[3:05:58] <nepwar> is this why he hates kirby?
[3:06:00] <OkamiDude15> @bioapple a grublord system woopsS
[3:06:08] <ValidVenasaur> oh boy he's gonna die irl from later areas if he found that hard

[3:06:44] <SatansDick1> seek seek lest
[3:06:47] <%xemnahort> @ValidVenasaur pat seems to be good at combat and bad at platforming so I'm excited to see how bad it can get
[3:06:48] <$Jayschroo> the downward spiral begins
[3:06:48] <%D_day> apatDab FULL TILT apatDab
[3:06:53] <AlchemiBeast> dont be afraid to take a breather if you need to
[3:07:06] <Darlington_the_Deceiver> let it set in
[3:07:08] <damienlunas> Man, is this game's art style beautiful or what
[3:07:09] <Polengoldur> for context, it is about 1am est
[3:07:24] <Blackflame69> Is this a pre-recorded stream? Is this chat pre-recorded?
[3:07:25] <prettypatties97> Or 10pm, in the true time zone
[3:07:27] <MyNameIsRasus> See? Already have 16% of what you lost
[3:07:28] <grayjammer> You could read some donations to refresh your brain pan
[3:07:32] <GMAN_SECTOR> ohhhhhh Pat totally let it set in
[3:07:34] <$Mendin> Fi;med before a live studio audience
[3:07:36] <nepwar> am i pre-recorded?
[3:07:46] <7thnightingale> #ONETRUETIMEZONE
[3:07:53] <SatansDick1> is this considered a live studio audience
[3:07:54] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> You're prerecorded
[3:07:55] <nepwar> was my life already predetermined and this was all a work
[3:07:55] <%BioApple> Predestined streams are an untapped market
[3:07:56] <pede2011> Should we guide him to Sly or let him get to him by himself?
[3:07:59] <Polengoldur> your death is pre-recorded but THEY won't let you watch it
[3:08:12] <knomad2b> let him exsplore
[3:08:13] <Blackflame69> it's all pre-recorded
[3:08:20] <grayjammer> @pede2011 get there himself
[3:08:20] <AlchemiBeast> #OURLORD'SCANONTRUETHUGTIMEZONE
[3:08:24] <$Mendin> The joy of hollow knight is the exploration

[3:08:35] <$Mendin> #GOTEM
[3:08:35] <+Spikyshrike> @pede2011 Someone might want to tell him if he's gotten this far
[3:08:36] <damienlunas> jebaited
[3:08:40] <Tisaric> shorrcut porn is plentiful
[3:08:44] <+tigerfang86> what if the true enemy of Hollow Knight is THE TIMECUBE
[3:08:47] <+Quarkee> vineStank
[3:08:49] <%xemnahort> schinjGotEm
[3:08:49] <Blackflame69> Blind run?
[3:08:54] <%BioApple> can't pogo those
[3:08:54] <Polengoldur> does he know to check for lamp posts near benches?
[3:09:00] <pede2011> I was thinking the same, or at least tell him to re check crossroads
[3:09:01] <vinnybushes> @pede2011 I still feel bad for trying to do it earlier
[3:09:02] <+nolifegamin> @Blackflame69 yep
[3:09:03] <+JustToWatch> once Pat realizes that he can do some hugening, he'll feel better
[3:09:04] <pennykettle_> no, dont tell him anything. I didnt find that npc until late game and I was fine
[3:09:07] <%bluetocho13> ah yes the shit area
[3:09:13] <%SuperCasualBoom> Bugs life *blasted Ice Cube music*
[3:09:13] <grayjammer> @Spikyshrike The most we should do is encourage him to look more around the crossroads at least
[3:09:23] <$Mendin> He said he's going back after clearing this funnel
[3:09:26] <+Spikyshrike> Sure
[3:09:27] <%xemnahort> @Blackflame69 the second he started streaming he gave up all hope of a blind run
[3:09:27] <$Mendin> I think
[3:09:28] <pennykettle_> @grayjammer or literally nothing
[3:09:31] <+Vestillion> At least this bug protag drinks his milk.
[3:09:33] <+Vestillion> that's good.
[3:09:35] <tearsaurther> I never seen pat so silent
[3:09:50] <%BioApple> drink your milk for healthy exobones
[3:09:54] <grayjammer> @pennykettle_ i agree.

[3:10:05] <Tisaric> POGO TIME

[3:10:32] <+WheatlyXT> Time Stop
[3:10:37] <%BioApple> @AngriestPat you can pogo most things but not thorns. I think the shiny sheen is a tipoff
[3:10:37] <$Mendin> Welcome to Obvious Progression Gate
[3:10:38] <$renegadehatter> This is where you start hitting WALLS
[3:10:39] <MyNameIsRasus> Heal stupid
[3:10:40] <+SuperMonkey2> lesson learned
[3:10:47] <+trnzero> If Paige likes skeletons, would that make bugs attractive due to their exoskeletons? :thinking:
[3:10:50] <+Garrosh_Heckscream> You absolutely don't need time stop
[3:10:52] <%Agami23> pogo is such a fun word
[3:10:53] <KnivesEve> dont heal
[3:10:54] <+Garrosh_Heckscream> Just super dash
[3:10:55] <GMAN_SECTOR> DIG UP STUPID
[3:10:56] <%xemnahort> is fungal the next area?
[3:10:56] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat mark your map now to save time in the future
[3:10:57] <Tisaric> HEAL
[3:11:00] <Tisaric> ok good
[3:11:01] <Big_King_Coconut> healing is a crutch for bad players
[3:11:10] <+Ciphris> need time stop for this
[3:11:11] <pennykettle_> so is attacking
[3:11:20] <Polengoldur> @Big_King_Coconut have u been to a pat stream?
[3:11:22] <vinnybushes> this part is a legit stumper
[3:11:28] <%DedlokPM> @Spydurman Nope. Not at all. This is despite the fact you dorectly told right after you get the dash that the dash exists and how to do it
[3:11:38] <%ECRead> this game is so pretty
[3:11:40] <grayjammer> @Big_King_Coconut JONI'S AND LIFEBLOOD CHARMS ONLY LETS GOOO
[3:12:01] <Spydurman> fucking hell
[3:12:01] <+Cofffee> I got lost in this game and stopped playing LUL
[3:12:02] <%DedlokPM> @Spydurman And that was sarcasm fyi.
[3:12:18] <arcadeking48> Dark Souls is the greatest 3D Castlevania game ever
[3:12:24] <zazzera01> that's a good comparison
[3:12:25] <+RowenCleric> Bloodborne is especially 3d castlevania
[3:12:33] <+Richardt_> thats what i've also said, Dark Souls is Castlevania 3D done correctly
[3:12:33] <arcadeking48> Well, actually Id say Bloodborne is, but details
[3:12:39] <%Agami23> the castle in bloodborne felt like the most castlevania castlevania
[3:12:43] <%Fenrirlives> could do without the stamina bar in that case
[3:12:48] <KnivesEve> yeah now that you mention it
[3:12:57] <$SGrim> Threaded Cane swagger power.
[3:12:57] <SatansDick1> threaded cane best weapon
[3:13:04] <29vigilanthand> Yeah Castlecainhurst is quite metroidvania
[3:13:10] <Polengoldur> i feel like emtroidvania gains more from souls-ian combat than souls-likes gained from metroidvania level design
[3:13:11] <zazzera01> get fromsoft to make the next 3d castlevania game
[3:13:15] <%BioApple> more games need big dumb wheels as weapons
[3:13:31] <+Garrosh_Heckscream> Open your shortcuts Pat
[3:13:33] <+Garrosh_Heckscream> You love it
[3:13:35] <Daniel_Is_I> Apparently the dude who made the FAR mod for Nier's PC port is working on fixing MHW's awful CPU usage.
[3:13:48] <cerberuscarmine> ayy nice
[3:13:51] <damienlunas> so did Pat fight Brooding Mawlek early?
[3:14:02] <marylittle5657> not yet
[3:14:15] <pede2011> @Daniel_Is_I is he being a condesending prick like with FAR?
[3:14:16] <29vigilanthand> Good eye
[3:14:17] <grayjammer> @damienlunas not even gruz mother
[3:14:17] <Polengoldur> actually thats a decent question: how is this game for progression skips?
[3:14:18] <%SuperCasualBoom> It‚Äôs the Dark Souls of...*shut up about Dark Soul metaphors*
[3:14:22] <pennykettle_> Saying spoiler names verbatim in chat ResidentSleeper
[3:14:24] <%DaRyeBeachHood> Brooding Mawlek is like 3 areas away
[3:14:25] <Tisaric> he kind of rushed through crossroads
[3:14:36] <%Agami23> just think, right now you would have 900
[3:14:38] <knomad2b> this is one of my fave games iv'e played this year. super damn good
[3:14:39] <BakerBrute> Chat you need to shut your mouths
[3:14:46] <cerberuscarmine> LOL
[3:14:47] <irocc500> hahaha
[3:14:49] <theredhairedtrainer> LUL
[3:14:51] <BakerBrute> Jesus yall are name dropping a ton of stuff like impatient babies

[3:14:52] <+CarlosEoM> LUL
[3:14:53] <BoonMcNougat> i think those big bush guys die in one soul blast and they drop like 18 coins or something
[3:14:56] <Shastafield> PopCorn
[3:14:58] <KnivesEve> okay that one sucked
[3:15:02] <cerberuscarmine> ayyy we bak
[3:15:04] <Polengoldur> oh no they said a name wich means absolutely nothing until you've already seen the nameplate over the boss

[3:15:38] <prettypatties97> that's a good name for a boss
[3:15:40] <%DaRyeBeachHood> It's like we said Gerhman, The First Hunter!!!
[3:15:41] <knomad2b> how about the raging Anus?
[3:15:48] <pede2011> Hey chat, remember how long until he fights Biggus Dickus?
[3:15:49] <%DaRyeBeachHood> *not*

[3:16:01] <Big_King_Coconut> Has pat found the super secret Zubaz boss fight yet?
[3:16:02] <+Garrosh_Heckscream> Dammit he's probably gonna get to THEM next stream and I'm gonna miss it
[3:16:04] <prettypatties97> If I ever make a video game (probably not) I'd like to steal that name
[3:16:04] <Polengoldur> i hand you dark souls remastered and tell you Artorias is a Bitch. that literally means nothing to you
[3:16:04] <damienlunas> Has he killed the Vociferous Bunghole

[3:16:08] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[3:16:17] <BakerBrute> This shit is a whole lot better
[3:16:20] <pennykettle_> *starts Bloodborne* HEY GUYS HAS HE BEATEN LADY MARIA OF THE ASTRAL CLOCKTOWER YET?
[3:16:35] <Tisaric> Every mechanic is super well thought out
[3:16:36] <%cerass> then use it
[3:16:37] <damienlunas> Oh fuck now I know a woman named Maria exists in this game
[3:16:39] <Daniel_Is_I> @pede2011 I dunno how he was a prick about FAR but he definitely isn't happy with the anti-modding shit Capcom put on MHW
[3:16:41] <damienlunas> thanks a lot
[3:16:42] <%craig_t> one complaint - the shit in front of the level conceals way to much in some zones
[3:16:43] <BoonMcNougat> its kind of like doom in that it encourages an aggressive playstyle to heal
[3:16:43] <nepwar> did pat defeat the bug god and time travel to modern day yet?
[3:16:56] <MonocledGhost> Hs he beaten the Frumiois Bandersnatch yet?
[3:16:57] <Polengoldur> holy shit now i know theres a clocktower in victorian era london. SPOILERS
[3:16:58] <%ECRead> I sleep. goodnight folks apatDab apatDab apatDab
[3:17:00] <knomad2b> the violated orifice is my fav boss
[3:17:08] <Gorgen> Has he arrive at The Pit of Endless Penetration yet?
[3:17:09] <ValidVenasaur> @nepwar no, he still needs the time stop ability
[3:17:11] <marylittle5657> @ECRead goodnight!
[3:17:13] <tearsaurther> Is this on ps4?
[3:17:21] <%Jpdodds> yes
[3:17:26] <+TeethMuncher> Smegmageddon = best boss
[3:17:27] <damienlunas> This game has BOSSES IN IT? Thanks for the spoiler!
[3:17:29] <$magikestral> @tearsaurther not yet, just pc and switch
[3:17:30] <marylittle5657> no only on pc and switch
[3:17:31] <pede2011> Has he beaten Artorias yet?
[3:17:31] <Weeabooninja> @tearsaurther nope, just PC and switch
[3:17:33] <%BioApple> Did Pat access Frog Fractions 3 from within the Cursed Restaurant yet?
[3:17:35] <nepwar> @ValidVenasaur oh shit he STILL hasn't got that
[3:17:36] <vinnybushes> @tearsaurther switch and pc at the moment
[3:17:38] <MyNameIsRasus> Pat did you find the Phalic Puncher upgrade yet?
[3:17:47] <Polengoldur> wait this game has controls in it? wtf i thought this was a cage game
[3:17:49] <%BioApple> LUL
[3:17:51] <+MetaSla> LUL
[3:17:52] <GMAN_SECTOR> Has Pat beaten the Dread Dwarf yet?
[3:17:55] <+Richardt_> LUL
[3:17:55] <kite1haseo> why
[3:17:56] <%DaRyeBeachHood> @pennykettle_ That's a named character and location. Asking if you killed The Blood Starved Beast is way different because there is NO CONTEXT there so not a spoiler! besides the name, but nothing is derived ftom that name
[3:17:57] <ValidVenasaur> DASH
[3:17:58] <SatansDick1> no touch the lightning
[3:18:00] <Kghaleon> lmao
[3:18:07] <marylittle5657> can't kill lightning bugs
[3:18:13] <ThirdStrike_Alex> Yo @angriestpat I‚Äôve been playing Gungeon and Dead Cells. How does this game‚Äôs sense of progression compare?
[3:18:15] <BakerBrute> Doable as fuck
[3:18:17] <ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat You Pat, how you liking H.K.?
[3:18:33] <knomad2b> nice
[3:18:37] <%commanderclaw> @ThirdStrike_Alex It's not a roguelike for one, it's more of a classic metroidvania
[3:18:38] <grayjammer> PER-FACT
[3:18:39] <pennykettle_> @DaRyeBeachHood its still a spoiler. pat got spoiled on Midir too
[3:18:39] <Tisaric> oh shit White Palace might not be so bad
[3:18:40] <nepwar> FUCK YEA
[3:18:41] <prettypatties97> Good shit Pat
[3:18:41] <marylittle5657> good charm
[3:18:42] <tearsaurther> Oh man.Its such a beautiful game. I only have a ps4.
[3:18:43] <%TheSniperJoe> Aaaaye, my second favorite Ginger is playing a game I've had installed since launch and never opened.
[3:18:46] <Polengoldur> @ThirdStrike_Alex this isn't as roguelike as them, Deadcells almost has no progression, so...
[3:18:48] <+TeethMuncher> LUL
[3:18:48] <Gorgen> Nice
[3:18:52] <theredhairedtrainer> LUL
[3:18:53] <Bendy_V> Really good crutch charm
[3:18:57] <rhus> The charm here is so good
[3:18:58] <damienlunas> Is it? I always thought any charm that was based around you taking damage was pretty bad.
[3:18:59] <%ThatGuyfromMars> it doesn't work like that pat
[3:18:59] <$magikestral> its really good if you get hit a lot
[3:19:07] <%Agami23> see pat, its the advanced platforming that your good at. the simple stuff is tough
[3:19:13] <%ThatGuyfromMars> you don't make thorns by jumping into them
[3:19:15] <ArbitraryTA> Pat you motherfucker stop being a pussy and drink potions before you identify them
[3:19:15] <nepwar> its a shame that doesn't attack the environments, pat's true rival
[3:19:16] <GMAN_SECTOR> Pat have you beaten the Blood-Starved Bug yet?
[3:19:18] <pede2011> Has he gotten the Moonlight Greatsword yet?
[3:19:18] <pennykettle_> I think all of the charms are viable except the ones that have straight upgrades
[3:19:21] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat Please tweet out when you get to the palace, thanks
[3:19:21] <ArbitraryTA> What's the chances that it's acid?
[3:19:23] <SatansDick1> rip
[3:19:27] <ValidVenasaur> go down
[3:19:30] <marylittle5657> @damienlunas well if your bad at dodging...
[3:19:41] <%BioApple> @pennykettle_ >not stacking pins on top of their own straight upgrades
[3:19:41] <ThirdStrike_Alex> @polengoldur by ‚Äúprogression‚Äù I meant any sense of self-improvement
[3:19:52] <Polengoldur> ok but i really need to know. is This Anor Londo?
[3:19:52] <nepwar> i wonder if pat will do the side quest to get neegan as a playable character
[3:19:59] <ThirdStrike_Alex> abilities, items, unlockables etc
[3:20:03] <$magikestral> @angriestpat protip: if you pause and quit, you'll go back to the last bench you sat at with all your progression and items saved (at least on switch)
[3:20:31] <%Ninestempest> pretty sure it works on PC as well
[3:20:32] <Polengoldur> @ThirdStrike_Alex every single run of dead cells you get some minor amount of "self improvement." dead cells is the only roguelike i know where the point is self improvement more than anything else, including actually getting to the next level
[3:20:35] <pede2011> You can use 2 different charms that improve the same thing, and the effect stacks @pennykettle_
[3:20:40] <Gorgen> Why isnt this on PS4
[3:20:41] <StencilOST> I love that exploration in this game is falling into new holes
[3:20:53] <%Agami23> i feel like this game started with them designing 30 different benchs
[3:20:55] <Etherealizer> wait you can reflect those!?
[3:20:57] <knomad2b> i... i never hit those back...
[3:20:58] <%DaRyeBeachHood> @pennykettle_ That's and optional boss that's easily missable and just knowing the name isn't a spoiler. Again, there was no context given as to what, where, why, or when the boss comes so it didn't spoil anything besides the name
[3:20:59] <$magikestral> @gorgen they're a team of 2-3 and have been working on the switch version/dlc
[3:21:01] <%Jpdodds> It's been real fun, but I'm going to bed. Night lads
[3:21:09] <%Ninestempest> lmao yall behind on that plant tech
[3:21:16] <prettypatties97> Man wtf are those things
[3:21:17] <Endocrom> I like to think this is how the Starship Troopers bugs came to be.
[3:21:19] <+camodikk> night
[3:21:22] <Tisaric> I'm surprised this isn't on PS4, but the switch version did take up a bunch of time
[3:21:26] <Etherealizer> I had no idea you could do that
[3:21:27] <marylittle5657> @Jpdodds goodnight!
[3:21:32] <Big_King_Coconut> oh hai cthulhu
[3:21:43] <pede2011> ARE THOSE THE ALIENS FROM METAL SLUG!!?!?
[3:21:46] <SatansDick1> youll see
[3:21:47] <vinnybushes> man, I totally attacked those wall butts with my nail like an asshole. props to you pat
[3:21:47] <prettypatties97> That's a spooky thing
[3:21:48] <Polengoldur> where those the aliens from Nier Tomato?
[3:21:50] <marylittle5657> can't do this bit yet don't bother
[3:21:51] <%TheSniperJoe> cheer500 Aye Pat, just got back from our second to last lamaze class. The only thing open to eat at this hour is WcDonalds, it was already feeling like a Boivin kinda evenin' even before seeing your stream up. Cheers and thanks for something fun to watch while decompressing.
[3:21:54] <dekkitout> inb4 ebreitas cameo
[3:21:54] <%craig_t> the spdier area of this game is super obnoxious, i can't see what i'm fighting half the time because of shit in the foreground
[3:21:59] <nepwar> are thosee aliens from neir
[3:22:07] <%Divryne> BLACK EVIL.
[3:22:08] <SatansDick1> need lamp
[3:22:11] <Gorgen> LUL
[3:22:12] <arcadeking48> Anytime anyone talks about Name Spoilers in a video game, I always go back to Amygdala. There is not a snowball's chance in hell that anyone could predict what that boss is going to be. Knowing the name alone means nothing to the contect or meaning of the thing.
[3:22:13] <+Spikyshrike> LUL
[3:22:16] <Tisaric> you need a lantern
[3:22:19] <YO_WHADUP> every time, he walks right into those fly traps while hitting them
[3:22:19] <SatansDick1> need lantern
[3:22:21] <+TeethMuncher> @craig_t I fell in without the lantern, fun times
[3:22:22] <pede2011> ABORT
[3:22:22] <+Vroom0> I couldn't get through here LUL
[3:22:22] <%frobeards> time stop
[3:22:25] <%DaRyeBeachHood> What a terrivle night for a curse
[3:22:26] <%Ninestempest> need time stop
[3:22:27] <prettypatties97> Well, I don't like this place
[3:22:30] <+WheatlyXT> Time Stop
[3:22:32] <Gorgen> Why is there a comedic thud when you land on spikes
[3:22:33] <theredhairedtrainer> I love Lamp Kappa
[3:22:35] <Pointdot> Boy did i spend a lot of time here, in the dark, naked and afraid
[3:22:37] <Big_King_Coconut> the lantern is a crutch for bad players
[3:22:37] <Bendy_V> Can't see in the dark without Time Stop
[3:22:38] <%Agami23> weird penis statues
[3:22:39] <marylittle5657> need more than lamp don't bother for a while
[3:22:40] <GMAN_SECTOR> its the black evil
[3:22:42] <grayjammer> A lamp is basically like a timestop, but for darkness
[3:23:00] <dekkitout> remember kids, there's never a time for a uber stand that becomes immediately out classed
[3:23:02] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat mark your map or you'll forget what exactly stopped you before
[3:23:02] <Tisaric> @AngriestPat also remember you can mark stuff now for later
[3:23:03] <+Quarkee> this game is nothing but walls
[3:23:04] <StencilOST> walls are good, walls mean you go the other way
[3:23:07] <$BoSteed> Now we know why Woolie is at a wall every week. Kappa
[3:23:15] <MyNameIsRasus> you might wanna mark the walls you're hitting with a red marker
[3:23:25] <%DaRyeBeachHood> these guys are fun
[3:23:30] <iyashino_ken> It sucks that you can't rent consoles
[3:23:33] <+MetaSla> it's free willy!
[3:23:34] <+gralho> dam
[3:23:35] <Gorgen> is that George BUSH?
[3:23:39] <$magikestral> i cheesed this guy HARD when i played
[3:23:40] <brendanVM> rename stream @angriestpat is bad at follow blight
[3:23:49] <Rostichenburg> I think it might get marked automatically at a later time anyway
[3:23:51] <pede2011> Am I the only one that didnt use a single marker in their entire run?
[3:23:56] <pennykettle_> @iyashino_ken I doubt thats even financially reasonable for either party
[3:23:59] <Big_King_Coconut> did you know that it's the Abyss that makes their eyes glow orange?
[3:24:03] <Tisaric> I didn't have the markers when I played
[3:24:05] <+gralho> ez clap
[3:24:05] <Rostichenburg> @pede2011 I didn't
[3:24:06] <marylittle5657> @iyashino_ken i think you might be able too at some really specialty places if you look
[3:24:07] <+Ciphris> gg ez
[3:24:13] <+gralho> moon2EZ
[3:24:18] <corepool> bc Crazy Talk
[3:24:19] <+MetaSla> the big bug was actually just a bunch of little bugs in disguise!
[3:24:19] <brendanVM> I didn't know markers were a thing
[3:24:21] <knomad2b> i think it's all the darksouls
[3:24:23] <reonome> because you suck
[3:24:25] <+TeethMuncher> @Rostichenburg by that time he'll have already come back and wasted time revisiting the place
[3:24:26] <@SSaryn> apatCrazy apatCrazyhand
[3:24:28] <Tisaric> Markers were part of the last DLC
[3:24:30] <grayjammer> @Big_King_Coconut i get the joke but please dont
[3:24:30] <Big_King_Coconut> @brendanVM same\
[3:24:30] <dekkitout> because because
[3:24:31] <pede2011> I just saw them as a waste of Geo
[3:24:34] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat I call that the Paige Syndrome. teenJOY
[3:24:34] <nzrai> maybe that's how it should be
[3:24:34] <%SuperCasualBoom> ‚ÄúCause maybe...your gonna be the wall to stop me!!! And after all!!! What the fuck, you wall!!!‚Äù
[3:24:35] <Etherealizer> is it because of THE GOUT?
[3:24:35] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Because you are a beautiful trainwreck of a human being
[3:24:38] <$serpenttucker> @AngriestPat You're probably overthinking it.
[3:24:38] <RedPlasticCup> People are good at different things
[3:24:40] <pennykettle_> because boss mechanics are universal for people who play games. you still need to get used to movement in this for platforming tho
[3:24:40] <prettypatties97> My guess is that Crazy Talk can sense that the platforming should be easy, so it fucks you
[3:24:43] <marylittle5657> hey pat have you looked at the journal yet?
[3:24:45] <KnivesEve> because you underestimate their power
[3:24:50] <irocc500> u just have a unique skill set
[3:24:55] <BoonMcNougat> just gotta get used to pogoing off the spikes
[3:24:56] <Polengoldur> i feel like the platforming is a lot less forgiving than the combat in the first half of this game
[3:25:00] <nepwar> !uptime
[3:25:00] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 25m 2s.
[3:25:04] <%Divryne> Its just a bug dick.
[3:25:04] <$eddi401> ooo I know, becuase spikes cant DIE
[3:25:06] <ThePuddingDead> cuz spikes are a legitimate threat and the sound and art design really sell their danger
[3:25:09] <%Divryne> Yes.
[3:25:10] <AlchemiBeast> yep
[3:25:11] <%DaRyeBeachHood> there should be a mod in this game for people afraid of insects that changes every insect into bears...
[3:25:12] <+BurncoatRapscallion> When he's fighting a boss, he has no time to talk, and Crazy Talk only activates when he speaks
[3:25:12] <%SuperCasualBoom> v-trigger 1 is crazy talk
[3:25:13] <+TeethMuncher> yes
[3:25:14] <SatansDick1> yep
[3:25:14] <%Divryne> Miniboss.
[3:25:15] <marylittle5657> yeah was just a mini
[3:25:17] <mentalgaminguk> yes
[3:25:19] <%commanderclaw> correct
[3:25:19] <reonome> ye
[3:25:19] <ValidVenasaur> yep
[3:25:23] <pennykettle_> not a mini boss, you just get locked in rooms for some encounters
[3:25:24] <Tisaric> The platforming gets much better with the abilities
[3:25:29] <iyashino_ken> Yeah, I get what you mean... Buuuuuuut, who knows?
[3:25:41] <Rostichenburg> That guy wasnb't even a miniboss the door didn't lock
[3:25:42] <marylittle5657> LUL
[3:25:43] <AlchemiBeast> the only boss you fought was false knight
[3:25:44] <knomad2b> oooh this parts fun
[3:25:48] <SatansDick1> use guy to bounce
[3:25:51] <irocc500> ohhhh
[3:25:51] <$eddi401> t0asteNlt
[3:25:52] <energywarning> sneaky
[3:25:52] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Did not know you could hit their projectiles back those things
[3:25:53] <Spydurman> LUL
[3:25:53] <Rostichenburg> Fals Knight and Hornet
[3:26:01] <nepwar> just run
[3:26:01] <Burpinator1> I didn't know I could hit those projectiles back til I was going back through completing the Hunter's Journal
[3:26:03] <DraxTD> common pat
[3:26:03] <%DedlokPM> @AlchemiBeast And Hornet. Even name plate popped up
[3:26:03] <damienlunas> slow and steady wins the race pat
[3:26:06] <AlchemiBeast> oh yeah and hornet
[3:26:08] <marylittle5657> @AngriestPat if you hold down while standing on a platform you can look down
[3:26:21] <AlchemiBeast> im stupid, my bad
[3:26:22] <Rostichenburg> Right stick can also be used to look easily
[3:26:23] <Big_King_Coconut> Fancy a swim? Kappa
[3:26:23] <$magikestral> you can totally spoil yourself on what's a real boss and what isn't by checking thsir journal entry btw, watch out @angriestpat
[3:26:26] <vinnybushes> cheer200 seeing you discover stuff in this game is like playing it for the first time again. here's some bits for even coming close to spoiling a thing and keeping my spoiler-ass mouth shut from now on.
[3:26:34] <Midnight188> Well he realized he can use them to surf
[3:26:37] <%craig_t> @AngriestPat not even really minibosses, just tougher enemies. think black knight as opposed to hollow soldier
[3:26:50] <energywarning> everything can be hurt. cept those big worm things
[3:26:55] <Rostichenburg> @AngriestPat You can kill them by hitting the face
[3:26:56] <Burpinator1> It feels fun
[3:27:02] <Gorgen> DOSH
[3:27:05] <nepwar> look at all that dosh
[3:27:08] <marylittle5657> yes you do pat don't lie
[3:27:08] <Polengoldur> i too enjoy shovel knight pogo's
[3:27:15] <Endocrom> Waiter, there are bugs in my Guacamelee
[3:27:18] <prettypatties97> yeyeye
[3:27:23] <Tisaric> time stop
[3:27:23] <iyashino_ken> I just wouldn't pay nearly $400 for a console with only 10 games and only one or two are good
[3:27:24] <%BioApple> oh god it's this room
[3:27:25] <+Ciphris> fwiend saved :D
[3:27:28] <+TeethMuncher> LUL
[3:27:28] <%Divryne> Nope.
[3:27:28] <%Ninestempest> lol
[3:27:31] <marylittle5657> can't go further yet
[3:27:33] <Kaneis> Y-Yay...you...you freed em
[3:27:34] <+TeethMuncher> turn back
[3:27:34] <+WheatlyXT> Time Stop?
[3:27:36] <iyashino_ken> Fuck the Switch
[3:27:37] <%Ninestempest> time stop is required
[3:27:38] <grayjammer> Time stop
[3:27:40] <%BioApple> I went through this room like two dozen times because I kept forgetting what the progress blocker at the end was
[3:27:40] <+trnzero> Progression=Blocked
[3:27:40] <AlchemiBeast> need time stop
[3:27:48] <pede2011> @AngriestPat mark it for later
[3:27:49] <Big_King_Coconut> 900 geo, 2 HP, no soul juice, and some tricky ass platforming. LETS GO
[3:28:02] <nepwar> man so many areas need time stop
[3:28:02] <Tisaric> just mark on your character
[3:28:04] <marylittle5657> how are you pogoing so well????
[3:28:07] <SatansDick1> you bought markers
[3:28:16] <$vinnybushes> the pogos feel great with a switch pro controller. some good rumblin'.
[3:28:19] <marylittle5657> i used red for hard areas
[3:28:27] <pennykettle_> blue means bad BrokeBack
[3:28:32] <Rostichenburg> @AngriestPat Hope you remember why you marked it
[3:28:35] <Polengoldur> red means go ???
[3:28:36] <damienlunas> I completely didn't know about the markers my first time through
[3:28:39] <nzrai> blue means stop
[3:28:47] <MyNameIsRasus> because blue means he stopped
[3:28:49] <+BurncoatRapscallion> I would color code based on what's keeping you from progressing
[3:28:50] <pennykettle_> @damienlunas I dont remember them at all. DLC I imagine
[3:28:51] <Gorgen> Do the marks do anything else than just mark?

[3:29:52] <pede2011> Thats a lot of money, would be a shame if something were to happen to it

[3:32:38] <prettypatties97> Man, there sure is a lot of time stop here
[3:32:39] <ArrogantPrimate> hey that black goo looks familiar, doesn't it? :D
[3:32:45] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Need time stop to defeat the black evil
[3:32:50] <Tisaric> this game is very time stop gated early on
[3:32:58] <knomad2b> jabujabu has really stepped things up
[3:32:58] <Polengoldur> i love how Time Stop has become shorthand for power you don't have yet
[3:32:59] <$magikestral> you can head down just fine, jusy avoid the big jellies
[3:33:01] <+Vestillion> I'm glad this game subconsciously encourages people to equate milk with vitality.
[3:33:01] <MyNameIsRasus> everybody say goodbye to the geo
[3:33:03] <pede2011> at this point he is going to reach the bottom without maps
[3:33:08] <Rostichenburg> Put all your money in the bank
[3:33:13] <+Vestillion> it's important to drink your milk.
[3:33:13] <Kghaleon> Almost sounds like he's humming the inspector gadget theme
[3:33:22] <Tisaric> you have to go through this tiny area without a map the first time
[3:33:22] <prettypatties97> I'm drinking milk right now
[3:33:22] <knomad2b> nice
[3:33:23] <%Ninestempest> nice
[3:33:24] <%cerass> jelly evil
[3:33:27] <+TeethMuncher> @pede2011 some of us suffered just like that
[3:33:31] <Big_King_Coconut> BUG BRO
[3:33:32] <Rostichenburg> @pede2011 The map for this area is ridiculously late
[3:33:33] <Weeabooninja> Should we tell him about the bank?
[3:33:35] <%DedlokPM> @Kghaleon Except not at all
[3:33:36] <Tredecian> left as well
[3:33:36] <SatansDick1> quirrel'
[3:33:37] <BakerBrute> Fuck these jellyfish in my game about bugs
[3:33:37] <pennykettle_> fuck no
[3:33:48] <marylittle5657> @Tisaric it take like 3/4 of the game to get the map
[3:33:56] <pennykettle_> if you have to ask if we should tell him anything the answer is no
[3:33:57] <ArbitraryTA> Ok guys I am missing a key piece of lore. What is the significance of Time Stop in this context. My inebriated ass cannot recall.
[3:33:59] <ArrogantPrimate> @Weeabooninja not a chance
[3:34:00] <pede2011> @Rostichenburg I know, I got it via buying at the end game, is dumb how late that map is
[3:34:00] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Peanut butter and jelly sandwich mimic
[3:34:07] <+I_need_pants> Cool. Is this mgs5 chapter 3 ?
[3:34:15] <Weeabooninja> I meant that it exists
[3:34:15] <ArcanumMBD> im so glad pat is finding quirrel so often. i missed a bunch of him on my first playthrough

[3:34:27] <kimo313> hello

[3:37:18] <Rostichenburg> @AngriestPat Trust the fungus
[3:37:23] <iyashino_ken> Friendcast Isn't on Twitch?
[3:37:28] <Pigbuster> I use that bug character as an mnemonic to remember that „É£ is pronounced "ya"
[3:37:33] <marylittle5657> @Kghaleon not even that i think
[3:37:38] <ArrogantPrimate> The Last Stag might be one of my favorite fast travel systems after you progress far enough in the game :D
[3:37:41] <Kaneis> Oof
[3:37:42] <Take_2_shots> I'm disappointed this is not Pat staring at an image of Hollow Knight for X number of hours instead of playing it.

[3:39:25] <+TeethMuncher> I warned him that he'd forget
[3:39:26] <%Divryne> Hollow Knight is the actual sequel to Metro 2033.
[3:39:26] <Rostichenburg> @AngriestPat You can bounce on these spikes
[3:39:34] <Tisaric> yeah markers
[3:39:36] <iyashino_ken> Does chat exist or nah?
[3:39:38] <Majiinbooh> pat you can bounce on the spikes
[3:39:38] <SatansDick1> you can bouce on spikes
[3:39:42] <ShawnEXE> you can
[3:39:43] <Tisaric> markers seem so nice to have
[3:39:47] <Tisaric> I wish they existed
[3:39:49] <%Divryne> He tried before.
[3:39:51] <marylittle5657> no!
[3:39:51] <$magikestral> you can bounce on spikes, but its NOT worth it
[3:39:52] <Kaneis> You've done it before
[3:39:53] <+TeethMuncher> Not worth it
[3:39:54] <grayjammer> @iyashino_ken nothing is real if mirrors arent real
[3:39:58] <Tisaric> not worth it
[3:39:58] <Rostichenburg> Do it
[3:39:59] <pennykettle_> stop backseating
[3:40:00] <pede2011> @AngriestPat That is kinda not the intended way, but you sure can
[3:40:01] <magmakhan3> thats super hard for little reward
[3:40:04] <Burpinator1> Metal Spikes are Pogo-able
[3:40:04] <BoonMcNougat> i think that might be sequence breaking lol
[3:40:09] <Caidezes> He already tried it.
[3:40:12] <$nademonkey1100> you have to attack the spicks and you bounce
[3:40:12] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> not worth it
[3:40:12] <$TheNeedlesD> they meant Scrooge McDuck it, Pat
[3:40:13] <%SteveTheGhost> I didn't know you could bounce on the spikes until I got to the last boss. lol
[3:40:17] <+TeethMuncher> LUL
[3:40:18] <prettypatties97> I feel like people are fucking with you
[3:40:19] <$Mendin> It's a metroidvania, sequence breaking is part and parcel
[3:40:21] <Tisaric> alright then
[3:40:22] <ShawnEXE> nah it's not sequence breaking
[3:40:23] <%DaRyeBeachHood> @angriestpat your down atrack has a wider hitbox than your character so you can bounce up easy
[3:40:24] <%ThatGuyfromMars> no way
[3:40:24] <Monstrosity09> EZ

[3:40:29] <Zeemod155> fucking hax
[3:40:29] <Mariakko> well fuck me
[3:40:33] <ValidVenasaur> you can do it but you spawn point will be stuck at the bottom
[3:40:38] <marylittle5657> you can dash in midair jsyk
[3:40:39] <Tisaric> that's actually kind of what you need to do in Path of Pain
[3:40:45] <+solipants> that wasn't suppose to work
[3:40:46] <$magikestral> oh no
[3:40:51] <Caidezes> Wow. Didn't think he'd pull it off. He failed the first time.
[3:40:52] <StencilOST> oh jeez
[3:40:53] <TheMeromex> rip
[3:40:54] <iyashino_ken> @grayjammer Hmmm
[3:40:57] <Rostichenburg> I did this super early and got ruined by this part
[3:41:01] <%Ninestempest> dont woryr, he can just main menu to go back to a bench
[3:41:01] <%BioApple> oh no what happened
[3:41:02] <%Divryne> A giant bug dick.
[3:41:02] <edwardskacz> this'll be good
[3:41:09] <Kaneis> I really love ASMR Pat, puts my heart at ease
[3:41:10] <%BioApple> i was gone did he do the bad thing
[3:41:13] <marylittle5657> @Tisaric yeah but not for vanilla game!
[3:41:13] <nepwar> i wonder if woolie did something similar resulting in going to areas that were hard
[3:41:19] <%Ninestempest> no he just technically sequence broke
[3:41:23] <Big_King_Coconut> oh man I remember this
[3:41:29] <energywarning> he hasn't sat at a bench, so it's fine
[3:41:33] <$magikestral> @nepwar sounds like he did a lot of the dlc before endgame, iirc
[3:41:35] <marylittle5657> @BioApple yeah he did a dumb thing
[3:41:41] <%DaRyeBeachHood> apatDab
[3:41:48] <magmakhan3> this is gonna screw him over
[3:41:49] <@SSaryn> Who wins, a Big Bug Boy or some Spiky Bois.
[3:41:51] <%Agami23> oh fuck, this thing
[3:41:53] <ArrogantPrimate> oh no
[3:41:53] <pede2011> GET FUCKED TIME
[3:41:54] <%BioApple> OH YEAH HE DID THE THING
[3:41:55] <Kaneis> Oh this guy sucks
[3:41:57] <grayjammer> Remember chat. this is our fault for telling him
[3:42:01] <SatansDick1> oh you gonna die
[3:42:03] <marylittle5657> Press F to pay respects to lost geo
[3:42:04] <Tisaric> This guy's a pain in the dick
[3:42:05] <RedPlasticCup> shitwrecker 5000
[3:42:08] <Etherealizer> F
[3:42:09] <%SteveTheGhost> You ain't beating this one yet lol
[3:42:10] <Rostichenburg> Good thing he can dash
[3:42:11] <@StridentSong> Well that's almost 1000 geo gone.
[3:42:12] <+TeethMuncher> He deserves this for listening
[3:42:12] <Kghaleon> Wow, losing all those souls
[3:42:14] <GMAN_SECTOR> OOOOOOOOOH YEAH TIME FOR BIG BOY PAT
[3:42:18] <iyashino_ken> He dickin Pat
[3:42:19] <Big_King_Coconut> this boss wrecked me so many times
[3:42:21] <strangelee> Why does the sound cut out on a hit? Is that by design?
[3:42:24] <Kghaleon> You guys got him killed. <_<
[3:42:29] <+sundayafternoon1> this thing gave me a hard time. I got to it too early
[3:42:30] <damienlunas> @AngriestPat so this is basically using the skeleton key to fight Havel early.
[3:42:34] <Etherealizer> I had to cheese this boss he was too hard for me
[3:42:36] <Tisaric> yeah that's by design, it's super impactful that way
[3:42:37] <%chocolatez3r0> !uptime
[3:42:38] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 42m 39s.
[3:42:39] <pede2011> F
[3:42:41] <marylittle5657> @strangelee yeah thats deliberate
[3:42:42] <@SSaryn> Oh boi.
[3:42:44] <%ThatGuyfromMars> fuuuuuuuuuuuuck
[3:42:45] <knomad2b> just throwing pat to the wolves
[3:42:45] <strangelee> ty
[3:42:48] <%commanderclaw> Man, fuck whoever told you to do that
[3:42:49] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat you're nail is nowhere strong enough, you got played
[3:42:50] <GMAN_SECTOR> rip 900 geo
[3:42:51] <prettypatties97> Chat why
[3:42:51] <SatansDick1> rip 900 geo
[3:42:51] <%Divryne> Not worth it.
[3:42:52] <%DaRyeBeachHood> apatDab
[3:42:53] <Kaneis> @strangelee I didn't like it at first either but it really grows on you -- you take that fucking hit hard
[3:42:55] <%AbnormalVoid> that's a hard boss for this part of the game
[3:42:55] <grayjammer> Why did we tell him he could go there again?
[3:42:56] <Kghaleon> He's here too early.
[3:42:56] <energywarning> not so fine
[3:42:56] <Caidezes> Well, that geo's gone.
[3:42:57] <BoonMcNougat> i think you're supposed to have wall jump to avoid the big spray lol
[3:43:03] <marylittle5657> @AngriestPat your best bet is to find the missing shopkeeper now
[3:43:05] <nepwar> 900 geo gone 4eva
[3:43:06] <MonocledGhost> geo drastic go down
[3:43:07] <@StridentSong> @AngriestPat You are not supposed to be there yet. He's about 2 Nail Upgrades stronger then you.
[3:43:07] <knomad2b> he can do it tho
[3:43:07] <Etherealizer> Chat just rolled up and stole all of Pat's lunch money wtf
[3:43:10] <BakerBrute> This is why you don't backseat. Nobody wins
[3:43:17] <pede2011> @AngriestPat you got played. told ya
[3:43:20] <%AbnormalVoid> you just have to go to his other side when he does the spray
[3:43:22] <Mariakko> You can avoid the big spray with the dash
[3:43:23] <BoonMcNougat> can still be done man
[3:43:24] <ShawnEXE> nah you don't need it
[3:43:24] <Kaneis> It's very possible to do without the walljump
[3:43:25] <%DaRyeBeachHood> He's beatable though
[3:43:26] <Rostichenburg> @AngriestPat You can dash over the spray
[3:43:28] <zal_silverfang> you trusted us
[3:43:28] <%Ninestempest> i mean half of chat was saying it was a seqauence break
[3:43:29] <marylittle5657> hey some of us tried to war you @AngriestPat
[3:43:31] <TheMeromex> gp get your shit and come back
[3:43:31] <+Richardt_> 900 Geo, RIP
[3:43:32] <%BioApple> @AngriestPat there's a gap in the spray that you can technically avoid, but yeah you're sequence breaking
[3:43:33] <Majiinbooh> u can totally beat it at his level
[3:43:33] <ShawnEXE> you can avoid big spray
[3:43:33] <prettypatties97> I didn't say shit, don't lump me in there with these shitposters
[3:43:34] <%Ninestempest> and yeah i NEVER used wall jump to get past that attack
[3:43:35] <$Mendin> Sequence Breaking into areas you're not meant to be is peak metroidvania
[3:43:37] <+solipants> we didn't make you go there
[3:43:38] <Burpinator1> If you can get there. Its beatable.
[3:43:41] <$vinnybushes> @AngriestPat your shade will spawn outside the boss door though
[3:43:42] <damienlunas> @AngriestPat you can beat him without any upgrades if you just learn his pattern. I did it with just the air dash.
[3:43:47] <Valask> @AngriestPat That Fates / Unlimited Codes video game me an aneurysm. Just why I watch you guys FeelsGoodMan
[3:43:49] <ValidVenasaur> i beat him without any upgrades. its doable
[3:43:50] <Majiinbooh> ^^^^
[3:43:50] <%Atomik456> Yeah I've always beaten that guy pre nail upgrades and wall jump
[3:43:54] <pennykettle_> Im glad the few spoiler people in chat are ruining it for the rest of us
[3:43:54] <Kghaleon> If you get your souls back, you can save and quit and it will send you back to the bench
[3:43:55] <magmakhan3> there is also a window to jump over him because his teeth dont have a hitbox
[3:43:56] <Tisaric> yeah the shade will be safe
[3:43:59] <%fallen92x> I've beaten the boss just like this, it is difficult but doable
[3:44:03] <+JustToWatch> @angriestpat after you kill your shade, if you quit to the main menu, you go back to the last bench you rested
[3:44:04] <pede2011> OH BOY
[3:44:06] <Pointdot> No yeah it's very beatable, it's just rougher to learn at this point
[3:44:11] <$Mendin> Pat dont forget the Soul Statue
[3:44:12] <Spydurman> rip 900 geo
[3:44:17] <$Mendin> PAT NO
[3:44:20] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat i highly recommend getting your geo back, then quitting to main menu so you don't have to deal with t he bos
[3:44:21] <Rostichenburg> @ValidVenasaur Yeah same here it's doable but it took a few tries
[3:44:24] <Tisaric> just leave
[3:44:25] <polybious12> BAAAAIL
[3:44:25] <magmakhan3> just leave
[3:44:26] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> quit the game
[3:44:28] <%Divryne> Quit the game.
[3:44:28] <pede2011> @AngriestPat RUN HOME BOYO
[3:44:28] <Tisaric> if you can
[3:44:29] <prettypatties97> Leave if you can
[3:44:29] <KnivesEve> GO SPEND IT
[3:44:29] <SatansDick1> quit game
[3:44:30] <ValidVenasaur> get your stuff and leave
[3:44:31] <Mariakko> take the money and go
[3:44:31] <Tisaric> QUIT
[3:44:32] <marylittle5657> @AngriestPat quit to menu!
[3:44:33] <iyashino_ken> So him shooting goo and Pat having to dodge it
[3:44:34] <%DaRyeBeachHood> The no death run is going well
[3:44:35] <ArrogantPrimate> main menu, please Pat
[3:44:35] <+zaworldo> QUIT DA GAME
[3:44:36] <Tisaric> SAVE AND QUIT
[3:44:36] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> leave
[3:44:36] <@StridentSong> Every boss is doable, but it's just a lot harder
[3:44:37] <Gorgen> shame you cant bone out
[3:44:38] <StencilOST> Quit to menu
[3:44:38] <%Ninestempest> or you can go up and leave that also works
[3:44:38] <GMAN_SECTOR> QUIT TO THE MAIN MENU
[3:44:38] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Coward out Pat
[3:44:41] <reonome> QUIT AND RELOAD
[3:44:41] <+TeethMuncher> Quit to menu!
[3:44:43] <%BioApple> I have done much dumber things than this so don't worry, I think on my second playthrough the mawlek was literally the first boss I got to
[3:44:43] <Kaneis> That's totally fine -- it's a rough boss but doable if you try enough times
[3:44:43] <$Mendin> SOUL STATUE TO THE LEFT
[3:44:48] <%Divryne> QUIT.
[3:44:49] <GMAN_SECTOR> QUIT AND RELOAD

[3:47:31] <udeadnightmare> Hey!
[3:47:33] <ShawnEXE> when you really think about it, those pikes are encouraging you do pogo it because you'd still need the wall jump without the spikes
[3:47:34] <TalisKanju> It's almost 2 where you are, go to bed Pat
[3:47:36] <Rostichenburg> No wonder a boss that is mostly spikes and acid beat him
[3:47:39] <ShawnEXE> down right?
[3:47:46] <%BioApple> @AngriestPat real talk though, this game is super super open and balanced so that you shouldn't have to worry about a critical path so don't listen to us
[3:47:51] <prettypatties97> The money go up, but the Hollow Knight go down
[3:47:54] <Kaneis> @DonatelloJose Seriously though haha, he shows so much patience towards chat; it's really admirable
[3:48:04] <pede2011> @AngriestPat If you dont know where to go, follow the ingame signs
[3:48:16] <Tisaric> The ghosts is town
[3:48:19] <ArrogantPrimate> is he on his way to the fuckbois?
[3:48:19] <$renegadehatter> FAKE WALL
[3:48:24] <SatansDick1> fake wall
[3:48:25] <Rostichenburg> I think that sign is buildings
[3:48:26] <marylittle5657> i think those are meant to represent houses
[3:48:26] <Tisaric> the ghosts is buildings
[3:48:29] <TheMeromex> fake wall, you hit it
[3:48:30] <SatansDick1> illusiory wall
[3:48:35] <$vinnybushes> time stop
[3:48:37] <knomad2b> need timestop
[3:48:38] <Tisaric> time stop
[3:48:38] <@SSaryn> A stomp..?
[3:48:38] <$nademonkey1100> so do you think he is going to torture himself with the flower quest?
[3:48:39] <marylittle5657> need ground pound
[3:48:46] <Weeabooninja> a timestop
[3:48:46] <$Audega> Need timestop
[3:48:46] <SatansDick1> illusiory wall to the left
[3:48:47] <udeadnightmare> So I only caught the end of SBFC, is Matt really leaving or was the chat trolling?

[3:49:11] <ArcanumMBD> or is it?

[3:49:12] <+TeethMuncher> @udeadnightmare he's dead, rest in pepperoni

[3:50:20] <SatansDick1> near blue
[3:50:23] <$nademonkey1100> did he do what i think he did
[3:50:27] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Later means later in a game that's as long as this
[3:50:30] <%BioApple> Chat is just a long series of orange soapstone messages and you can't tell which are real
[3:50:33] <%Divryne> STOP BACKSEATING YOU WEEBS. apatDab apatDab apatDab
[3:50:36] <Majiinbooh> i think the fungal wastes is the progress you made by getting the dash
[3:50:37] <Kghaleon> Breakable walls aren't progress anyway.
[3:50:39] <%BioApple> btw, try jumping
[3:50:41] <prettypatties97> If I learned anything from my parents, later means never
[3:50:49] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Eat shit you fuck apatDab apatDab
[3:50:52] <prettypatties97> "We'll go to Disneyland later in the summer" they said
[3:50:52] <+TeethMuncher> @Divryne that's what chat is for though
[3:50:55] <$vinnybushes> I really wish it let you zoom the map in more. like my only complaint about the game
[3:50:57] <Tisaric> yeah fungal wastes is next
[3:51:00] <marylittle5657> lower down
[3:51:03] <%Divryne> KEK
[3:51:08] <Kaneis> Never spend your money because then you lose money if you spend it. Facts.
[3:51:12] <KnivesEve> i dont know anything about this game other than the fact that money is giving me anxiety
[3:51:13] <TalisKanju> Yo Pat! Excited for Swery65's The Missing?
[3:51:17] <$Mendin> try horse but hole
[3:51:24] <ValidVenasaur> just keep exploring
[3:51:24] <Rostichenburg> Gotta get that gathering swarm
[3:51:24] <+GuelermeDias> dodge the teethed penises pat
[3:51:28] <%DaRyeBeachHood> apatDab backseating apatDab intensifies apatDab
[3:51:32] <%Agami23> fucking grabloids
[3:51:35] <nepwar> you lose money when you spend it. not a good option imo
[3:51:40] <+TeethMuncher> @GuelermeDias they'll chew your ovaries
[3:51:46] <Rostichenburg> Need more money
[3:51:52] <%Ninestempest> ah, but if you spend money when it's a sale, you GAIN money
[3:51:54] <Tisaric> It's buildings, for the city
[3:51:55] <Weeabooninja> It means ghosts
[3:51:55] <GMAN_SECTOR> Pat just wait until you face the AssBlasters
[3:51:56] <+GuelermeDias> nice nickname/message combo
[3:51:59] <prettypatties97> @TeethMuncher Wait, why are they going all the way to the ovaries?
[3:52:01] <iyashino_ken> @Kaneis You'll get it back, just don't expect it
[3:52:02] <Kaneis> @Ninestempest Then it's FREE
[3:52:07] <KayThree> it means "here lies pat, he never scored"
[3:52:08] <Rostichenburg> @AngriestPat The sign post is buildings
[3:52:09] <%BioApple> Pat, spend that geo on loot boxes
[3:52:16] <marylittle5657> have to get this from the bottom
[3:52:18] <+TeethMuncher> @prettypatties97 you think dicks with teeth aren't hungry?
[3:52:27] <ValidVenasaur> GHOST BUGS
[3:52:29] <Gorgen> spend the Geo on PLat
[3:52:33] <Kaneis> @iyashino_ken But you can have more if you hoard it under a rug
[3:52:40] <%cerass> he tried
[3:52:49] <Tisaric> Gruz Mother time
[3:52:50] <prettypatties97> @TeethMuncher I guess that's fair, so they just eat they're way up the fallopian tubes?
[3:52:51] <Kaneis> Go hug it
[3:52:54] <TheMeromex> hes super easy
[3:52:55] <Weeabooninja> You need Geo to dress up your space bug wizard
[3:52:55] <Rostichenburg> Gruz
[3:52:57] <marylittle5657> no keep going there!
[3:53:00] <nepwar> !uptime

[3:53:24] <reonome> inb4 pat dies
[3:53:25] <Tisaric> This is more of a miniboss
[3:53:26] <crimsonharvest> Does Pat's computer have some kind of audio attenuation going on?
[3:53:30] <+GuelermeDias> skillful patplay
[3:53:30] <+TeethMuncher> @prettypatties97 yeah, and then pelvises fuse together. Do they not teach sex ed anymore?
[3:53:32] <Aleate> Mother?? BibleThump

[3:53:39] <knomad2b> @AngriestPat i got sonic mania plus today and now i'm realizing that you are super good at blue sphere
[3:53:40] <nzrai> ez

[3:53:45] <ValidVenasaur> miniboss
[3:53:45] <%Fedgle> you
[3:53:47] <%Divryne> It's meant to be the second boss you fight.
[3:53:47] <Pairoschuz> I can't believe Pat killed a pregnant lady and Paige wasn't around to see it
[3:53:47] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> how did he miss that fight?
[3:53:47] <%Fedgle> did
[3:53:48] <+Debuggingfool> That loss of sound is super disorienting
[3:53:49] <%Fedgle> it
[3:53:49] <ArcanumMBD> this was boss 1
[3:53:50] <SainEdge> the babies!
[3:53:51] <crimsonharvest> Like when pat gets hit the th ing goes dead silent for a second
[3:53:53] <%cerass> yay pat you beat your mom
[3:53:58] <@SSaryn> Oh that's just the game.
[3:53:59] <grayjammer> @crimsonharvest thats intenntional
[3:54:01] <Etherealizer> PREGNANTE
[3:54:02] <ArrogantPrimate> that look was great :D
[3:54:04] <+GuelermeDias> that's literally the bee plane miniboss from MMX
[3:54:07] <scrumdrew> thats the game
[3:54:09] <%reandgaf> ooooh it's the game?
[3:54:11] <Rostichenburg> @crimsonharvest It's intentional makes the game dramatic
[3:54:13] <+zaworldo> That's intentional
[3:54:13] <marylittle5657> @crimsonharvest no thats part of the game and is intentional
[3:54:14] <$Mendin> No that's the game's hitstop being huge and beefy
[3:54:16] <prettypatties97> @TeethMuncher Been a while since sex ed, so I kinda got a bit hazy on the inner workings I suppose
[3:54:18] <Tisaric> The game blows out all the sounds when you get hit
[3:54:19] <%reandgaf> that makes it sound like it's under water
[3:54:20] <BoonMcNougat> yeah its hit stun
[3:54:24] <crimsonharvest> ok well thats fine it just feel ssuper weird to my brain
[3:54:24] <ArrogantPrimate> he found the Black Bug!!
[3:54:29] <TheEdrem> if only paige was here to see you kill a pregnant woman
[3:54:31] <mentalgaminguk> that's a lot of geo
[3:54:35] <$Mendin> A big thump, deafening, the floaters
[3:54:38] <+GuelermeDias> paige would be so proud
[3:54:44] <$Mendin> It wants you to know you were IMPACTED
[3:54:50] <%cerass> pat killed his mom
[3:55:13] <marylittle5657> oh wow i missed that clue in that dialogue the first time
[3:55:17] <SatansDick1> shop
[3:55:19] <+GuelermeDias> it's been a while since we had a good, wholesome pat's mom joke
[3:55:24] <ArrogantPrimate> huh, the orange mist made him dream eh?
[3:55:26] <Endocrom> It's that bug that lives with Kin Kai
[3:55:30] <$Audega> @AngriestPat Really glad you're playing this as a stream instead of an LP
[3:55:31] <Endocrom> King*
[3:55:34] <Rostichenburg> Gregory?
[3:55:37] <+resstarr> 4Head
[3:55:39] <Tisaric> it's so creepy to learn that all the bugs that you're fighting are just asleep and dreaming
[3:55:40] <$Mendin> Best Girl
[3:55:43] <Rostichenburg> Salubra
[3:55:46] <Pairoschuz> Salubra!
[3:55:47] <cerberuscarmine> aww yeeee
[3:55:47] <%Ninestempest> THICC
[3:55:48] <$Audega> He reminds me of Issun from Okami
[3:55:49] <%AbnormalVoid> LUL
[3:55:51] <prettypatties97> Is Gregory the monkey or was that Bubbles?
[3:55:52] <%AbnormalVoid> Homer
[3:55:54] <$Mendin> She
[3:55:57] <bryanmildew> mmmmm... buuuggss..
[3:55:57] <+TheShal> METATRON
[3:56:00] <TheEdrem> save money for sly!
[3:56:02] <BoonMcNougat> godammit it does have homer mouth lol
[3:56:03] <marylittle5657> @Tisaric no they are in fact actually dead don't worry
[3:56:04] <TheMeromex> save your money
[3:56:05] <%cerass> maddentown?
[3:56:08] <%BioApple> this NPC always looked like some 1930s animation to me
[3:56:09] <BakedBam> hey pats mom
[3:56:11] <Rostichenburg> @AngriestPat You can talk to shopkeepers as well as shop
[3:56:15] <+TeethMuncher> You could lose yourself in that blubber
[3:56:21] <+resstarr> Longnail is p good
[3:56:27] <marylittle5657> its a mollusk
[3:56:31] <TalisKanju> Anyone got any bug facts to roll out?
[3:56:34] <@SSaryn> More temporary health I assume.
[3:56:34] <Tisaric> @marylittle5657 oh do they fully die at some point? I thought that sly dialogue implied they were just dreaming
[3:56:42] <nepwar> look through all of them first
[3:56:49] <$magikestral> remember, you have another shopkeeper now up top- possibly save your money unless you like it a lot
[3:56:59] <roguemerc69> cheer500 Sup Pat, you ever play fibbage? Basically you make fake answers to statements, then pick the correct one. Might make for a good one off or even scrublords.
[3:57:06] <crimsonharvest> This is the same mechanic as software in La Mulana, also an excellent game
[3:57:07] <Kghaleon> The best thing she has is charm slots.
[3:57:17] <LtThunderbolt> !up time
[3:57:18] <%cerass> death by crushed pelvis
[3:57:19] <SatansDick1> extra slots
[3:57:27] <Rostichenburg> Gotta buy more charms
[3:57:31] <+GuelermeDias> EXPAND NAIL
[3:57:33] <damienlunas> Longnail is good
[3:57:41] <+SuperMonkey2> SWORD GROW LONGER
[3:57:54] <damienlunas> Steady Body is great if you don't like the bounceback.
[3:57:56] <%Ninestempest> inb4 pat skips steady body
[3:58:02] <prettypatties97> SWORD LENGTH GO UP
[3:58:02] <+GuelermeDias> pat's nail so long
[3:58:03] <%Ninestempest> the thing that's killed him multiple times
[3:58:04] <SainEdge> quickfokus is also really nice
[3:58:04] <Tredecian> sly is a merchant
[3:58:06] <Kghaleon> nah, steady is the best
[3:58:16] <+TeethMuncher> @AngriestPat steady body will save you from accidental pit deaths
[3:58:23] <Rostichenburg> Steady body ok but I got used to the bounce back
[3:58:28] <%Divryne> Steady Body makes it so you don't get knocked back if you hit something.
[3:58:29] <KayThree> hollow shovel?
[3:58:32] <marylittle5657> sly's such a dick and i love it
[3:58:34] <%BioApple> I never got used to steady, I kept walking into people like a dumdum
[3:58:36] <Tredecian> shovel hollow
[3:58:42] <pennykettle_> try equipping too many charms, coward
[3:58:46] <ValidVenasaur> OVERCHARM
[3:58:49] <pede2011> @AngriestPat you can force more charms by spamming it on the select charms screen
[3:58:50] <$Mendin> shush
[3:58:50] <$magikestral> you can equip more than your notches if you try hard enough @angriestpat
[3:58:50] <%frobeards> pat, your compass
[3:58:51] <Rostichenburg> Can't wait until Pat get's lost now
[3:58:59] <KnivesEve> hollow shovel
[3:59:01] <Tredecian> leave one slot open then force it
[3:59:04] <Kghaleon> Steady is an awesome charm
[3:59:05] <ronyncato87> Wow that laughing is annoying
[3:59:06] <marylittle5657> don't you take 2x damage
[3:59:07] <Tisaric> keep trying to force the charm in
[3:59:08] <Crimpson> Don't fret too much on getting many charms immediately. You can't use most that you can buy right now because of how many notches they cost and how much they cost which you will get a lot of the currency as long as you do not die a second time
[3:59:10] <%BioApple> The Legend of Shovel Hollow
[3:59:10] <prettypatties97> I feel like this will be a mistake
[3:59:13] <Rostichenburg> You still need 1 slot
[3:59:20] <Tisaric> It'll warn him
[3:59:22] <Burpinator1> Take more damage when you Overcharm. But more charms tho
[3:59:31] <pennykettle_> PogChamp
[3:59:32] <ValidVenasaur> just for funsies
[3:59:32] <%Ninestempest> YEA
[3:59:32] <Tredecian> double damage
[3:59:33] <+TeethMuncher> POWER
[3:59:33] <%BioApple> not when I shift into MAXIMUM OVERCHARM
[3:59:34] <%SteveTheGhost> Overcharming is the key to happiness.
[3:59:35] <Kaneis> Man this laughing is getting my loins rustled
[3:59:35] <+resstarr> ruh robh
[3:59:36] <Caidezes> So much backseat gaming.
[3:59:36] <TalisKanju> Headless Hollow Shovel

[3:59:50] <AlchemiBeast> you take X2 damage
[3:59:51] <%Ninestempest> NOTHING CAN GO WRONG

[4:00:08] <%SteveTheGhost> Just don't get hit, problem solved
[4:00:09] <@StridentSong> I never knew about overcharming either
[4:00:11] <BakerBrute> YOU DON NO WHACHA MESSIN WIT
[4:00:11] <SatansDick1> kalaYeet ring
[4:00:12] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Glass Cannon Pat here we go!
[4:00:15] <iyashino_ken> Only backseeding I ever done was that eps of RE5, shoot her with a magnum, Pat
[4:00:18] <$Audega> I never knew about this...
[4:00:20] <+TeethMuncher> YOU DON NO WHACHA MESSIN WIT
[4:00:23] <Burpinator1> All fun and games till you encounter things that do 2 damage and take 4 lol
[4:00:24] <Tisaric> It's super cool
[4:00:26] <Tredecian> best the game without knowing
[4:00:29] <%Divryne> FUCK I DID NOT EVEN KNOW YOU COULD DO THIS.
[4:00:29] <cerberuscarmine> :D
[4:00:30] <Crimpson> You are going to die in like one hit
[4:00:31] <Tisaric> It's such a great mechanic
[4:00:31] <Tredecian> beat*
[4:00:34] <+GuelermeDias> pat is gonna get blown the FUCK up
[4:00:36] <Scumsave> jesus i dont know how much longer i can deal with that NPCs chuckling
[4:00:38] <Kghaleon> Never knew it was a thing.
[4:00:44] <$Mendin> 666 Geo Hail Sata-aw
[4:00:47] <$vinnybushes> @AngriestPat I knew about it but wussed out during my playthrough
[4:00:47] <startstoprepeat> just never get hit. easy.
[4:00:49] <%Divryne> Strength go up.
[4:00:50] <pennykettle_> I like how theres a whole animation for, NO I WANT TO THOUGH
[4:00:50] <Crimpson> It's never really worth it at the start
[4:00:54] <+BurncoatRapscallion> It's such a neat hidden mechanic that I wish could be hinted at
[4:00:54] <%Divryne> Defense go DOWN.
[4:00:54] <crimsonharvest> I never expected to learn something new from a Pat stream.
[4:00:56] <JGardner88> Speaking of RE5 watching only Pat attack Wesker and having Matt dick around was fun to watch lmao
[4:00:58] <+TeethMuncher> LUL
[4:01:03] <$TheNeedlesD> Odds of Woolie not knowing this?
[4:01:03] <%cerass> put on even more charms
[4:01:03] <grayjammer> Now do you understand what woolie meant when he said The Back Down
[4:01:04] <pennykettle_> 100% understandable
[4:01:06] <+TeethMuncher> He can't handle the power
[4:01:09] <cerberuscarmine> overcharm later lol
[4:01:09] <+SuperMonkey2> the back down
[4:01:11] <%cerass> all the charms
[4:01:13] <cerberuscarmine> when your pro at the game
[4:01:13] <AlchemiBeast> the backdown
[4:01:13] <@StridentSong> Yeap, that means things that hit you for 2, will now hit you for 4
[4:01:14] <nepwar> but now you know
[4:01:15] <$Mendin> "Double damage? Fuck it" *three enemies later* "Ok it's a little too much"
[4:01:18] <MyNameIsRasus> !uptime
[4:01:19] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 1m 20s.
[4:01:23] <Tisaric> Some charms can completely make it worth though
[4:01:25] <nepwar> so when you find all the STRENGTH CHARMS
[4:01:26] <crimsonharvest> TOP TEN FASTEST BACKDOWNS
[4:01:28] <nzrai> put your limiters back on
[4:01:34] <%cerass> clip that
[4:01:45] <marylittle5657> will you do a full playthrough of this @AngriestPat ?
[4:01:50] <+GuelermeDias> enlarging your nail AND your viscous white liquid output is too much for such a little boy
[4:01:54] <iyashino_ken> @JGard--- Yeah, still good eps

[4:02:19] <nepwar> yeyeye
[4:02:19] <$Mendin> You can't get to Birkin's Lab with the tram just yet

[4:02:22] <Tisaric> yeyeyeye
[4:02:23] <cerberuscarmine> i love this game
[4:02:23] <BakerBrute> @AngriestPat Are you going to do a 100% run?
[4:02:30] <AlchemiBeast> staring at hollow knight
[4:02:34] <Rostichenburg> Get ready for bounce
[4:02:35] <Crimpson> Dude this game is amazing, but yet frustrating due to the semi hard boss fights
[4:02:38] <$Mendin> Yes do that while overcharmed
[4:02:38] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Caterpillar friend!
[4:02:40] <crimsonharvest> look at this super mario galaxy chalange room shit

[4:02:41] <nzrai> pat confirmed just watching a prerecorded video FeelsBadMan
[4:02:42] <pennykettle_> 100% is absurd
[4:02:42] <prettypatties97> Gotta free the friend!
[4:02:42] <+BurncoatRapscallion> Platforming while OVERCHARMED
[4:02:52] <$Mendin> Yes ha ha ha, yess
[4:02:54] <cerberuscarmine> yay!
[4:02:55] <Tredecian> dlc aug 20th
[4:02:55] <marylittle5657> @AngriestPat as forewarning, inside the trams and in one other area, have the only premanantly breakable background objects in the game so don't break them
[4:02:56] <@StridentSong> I love the use of "Time Stop" as a non-spoiler way of telling Pat to come back with a different item/ability?
[4:02:56] <+GuelermeDias> yay little dickworm friend!
[4:02:56] <polybious12> FRIEND DETECTED
[4:02:57] <prettypatties97> YEAH
[4:02:57] <pennykettle_> Paige is Overcharmed
[4:03:00] <%BioApple> BTW, can anyone in chat tell me without spoiling when the DLC stuff starts showing up? I'd like to avoid it until G&G comes out and I can play through it all myself
[4:03:01] <+gralho> warframe still love you, even if you dont care anymore moon2WAH moon2WAH
[4:03:02] <TalisKanju> He said ELMO

[4:03:25] <BakerBrute> @BioApple DLC stuff is super late game. dont worry too much about it
[4:03:26] <Tisaric> You should at least get true ending, you don't need to 100% to get it

[4:04:00] <marylittle5657> @BioApple there is a very specific thing you have to do to activate the grimm troupe, and its very obvious

[4:05:12] <marylittle5657> @BioApple even after you activate the dlc you don't have to do it right away cause you have to equip a certain charm you get to actually be able to progress so don't worry about it

[4:27:13] <iyashino_ken> Pat scratchin his, lmao
[4:27:13] <Tisaric> hornet is best waifu
[4:27:16] <@SSaryn> Hornet IS best waifu.

[4:27:50] <$nademonkey1100> Cloth is best
[4:27:53] <+Tonku_the_Red> What's Hornet from?
[4:28:05] <+DevoBoss> Cloth is the Seigmeyer of HK
[4:28:08] <iyashino_ken> Noooo reply
[4:28:08] <%craig_t> i can't wait to see the weird BIG PORNZ of this game when I wrap it up completely
[4:28:10] <Cthulos> Hollow Knight, this game
[4:28:14] <@SSaryn> Waow
[4:28:21] <Tomschiii> cant wait for it
[4:28:21] <marylittle5657> Hornet is the name of the pink robed boss pat fought
[4:28:23] <Endocrom> Hornet was the girl in red
[4:28:36] <Tisaric> the vergil waifu
[4:28:40] <sakeydo> Bought lone wolf thinking about furi next
[4:28:51] <Tisaric> Furi is fucking amazing too
[4:28:53] <@SSaryn> Death's Gambit has officially come out on Steam with 28 Reviews at 89% on Steam
[4:29:08] <%Agami23> isnt that the name of the dude from silent hill downpour?
[4:29:17] <Tomschiii> furi is short but great. needs a Second game
[4:29:31] <+DevoBoss> conversely the MHW reviews on steam are 50/50 good/bad
[4:29:51] <prettypatties97> One day I wanna grow up to be as big and strong as Elmo
[4:29:53] <Cthulos> So someone needs to do art of Pat as the hollow knight and Paige as hornet
[4:29:58] <Tomschiii> I dont even want to know what they are saying about mhw
[4:29:59] <beardeddragon72> yall mind if i uhhhhhhhh fall asleep to this chill ass stream
[4:30:03] <Tisaric> Furi's hard mode was enough to make it long enough for me
[4:30:18] <grayjammer> Paige would prefer to be cloth tbh
[4:30:26] <zal_silverfang> Pat as Lote
[4:30:28] <%Atomik456> Pat and Piage would be the Mapping couple come on
[4:30:30] <Hs413> Accurate heights
[4:30:38] <%cervidaequus> Still going or ending now?
[4:30:42] <grayjammer> @Atomik456 Not wrong

[4:30:55] <applesonthemoon> perfectly comf, as all things should be
[4:30:58] <Spydurman> is this an asmr stream now?
[4:30:59] <crimsonharvest> Once we can join in progress quests
[4:30:59] <@SSaryn> Not cheat.
[4:31:08] <+drakhnar> I have a feeling that Paige would totally be Zote the Mighty
[4:31:37] <@SSaryn> apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink
[4:31:40] <%BioApple> elmo really likes obsidian i guess
[4:31:49] <KnivesEve> so it would have been a good idea for mhw to get a demo out to test shit out?
[4:31:50] <%chocolatez3r0> apatBlep apatBlep
[4:32:01] <%Atomik456> So do I, but their games are buggy much as I love em.
[4:32:13] <@SSaryn> Jackbox Party Box stuff.
[4:32:13] <+HaloZorro> @AngriestPat Eh when is the Wow stream eh?
[4:32:19] <Tisaric> It's Jackbox

[4:32:23] <$Audega> It's a Jackbox game
[4:32:25] <SatansDick1> jackboxb

[4:32:40] <ragasquid> do it you coward
[4:32:41] <+HaloZorro> @AngriestPat Give in
[4:32:45] <%Agami23> dont do it
[4:32:46] <%TheSniperJoe> My wife is IN that game and I'm not going to play it, that is how hard World of Warcraft can fuck off.
[4:32:47] <%Agami23> be strong
[4:32:50] <%craig_t> do the drugs
[4:32:50] <@SSaryn> Fucking nerds.
[4:32:52] <+mugwugsampoo> @angriestpat Do it you coward
[4:32:54] <SatansDick1> no wow is for nerd
[4:32:59] <bryanmildew> cat is looking at us
[4:33:01] <$vinnybushes> I somehow avoided wow for it's entire run I have no idea how
[4:33:03] <bryanmildew> i love cat
[4:33:04] <Cthulos> What a sweetie
[4:33:06] <%altairibnlaahad909> wow is not good you guys, please :\
[4:33:08] <+HaloZorro> @AngriestPat Be the biggest coward an not dont do it.
[4:33:17] <crimsonharvest> the WoW updater just out-bandwidth'd Twitch and made it stutter
[4:33:17] <Etherealizer> I think I would rather drink bleach than play WoW
[4:33:22] <%BioApple> do a wow stream that is just you buying cosmetics
[4:33:23] <prettypatties97> As a nerd, stop playing WoW you nerds, and play Warcraft 3
[4:33:33] <KnivesEve> ive never played wow due to not finding it interesting
[4:33:39] <+mugwugsampoo> @angriestpat I just bought WoW today for the first time, was that a mistake?
[4:33:39] <%reandgaf> OH PAT IS CONTROLLING
[4:33:40] <%Agami23> didnt stop him last time
[4:33:42] <%reandgaf> BANNER SAGA
[4:33:46] <%reandgaf> I'M SO HYPED NOW
[4:33:47] <+Xombor> Woolie will betray humanity by stabbing pat
[4:33:48] <ValidVenasaur> it happened in xcom
[4:33:49] <%Atomik456> Always betray humanity, we deserve it
[4:33:52] <grayjammer> World of Warcraft is Straight Culture
[4:33:56] <VanLynx> woolie betrayed humanity in XCOM and you were on the controls
[4:33:56] <%TheSniperJoe> Stream is just a character idling in Moonguard's Goldshire.
[4:34:01] <CapCasual> With your plataforming there is a part of the game that I'm eager for you to get to. Kappa @AngriestPat
[4:34:03] <+HaloZorro> @AngriestPat Ill drop $10 if you do wow stream tomorrow
[4:34:04] <%craig_t> @AngriestPat he didn't have the controls last time
[4:34:05] <Rostichenburg> Woolie took the controls away to betray humanity in detroit
[4:34:10] <KnivesEve> i played ff11 at the time ;p
[4:34:11] <+Tonku_the_Red> I cannot play consistently enough to justify a monthly subscription for an MMO.
[4:34:14] <@SSaryn> Go to bed nerds.
[4:34:16] <%craig_t> well, gnight folks
[4:34:18] <prettypatties97> Too be fair to Woolie, I'd probably betray humanity for sick ass jetpacks
[4:34:23] <hntronium> Unfuck your sleep schedule pat
[4:34:24] <ghostravens> goodnight y'all
[4:34:25] <bryanmildew> nighty night pattycakes
