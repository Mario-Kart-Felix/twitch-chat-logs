[0:21:03] <%Mendin> Not wrong
[0:21:04] <bob900000> it was on the game boy
[0:21:04] <%greasypete00> thats pretty much what it is
[0:21:04] <ChungusQuest> LttP after ten years of dialysis
[0:21:05] <Funky_Honkey> well it was a GameBoy game originally after all
[0:21:09] <%Mendin> It was for the Original Gameboy
[0:21:11] <%AyotoCorp> AyotoCorp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 29 month streak! Link's Awakening is literally a failed port of Link to the Past to the GameBoy
[0:21:15] <@BigNaturalMan59> oh no hes letting it set in
[0:21:16] <marvel877> They took Link To The Past and put it on Gameboy. That is exactly what it was.
[0:21:16] <ammobasket> Yup
[0:21:22] <%BigCoffee> lttp came after Pat
[0:21:27] <marvel877> Kinda, yeah.
[0:21:28] <@SSaryn> Probably could have done more due to being a remake but yeah, the Gameboy thing is ehhhh.
[0:21:32] <+based_lobster> I canâ€™t believe weâ€™re still on December 33rd.
[0:21:41] <majindusto> IT LITERALLY WAS A GAMEBOY GAMEBOY
[0:21:43] <%ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[0:21:45] <%Mendin> It was LttP 0.5
[0:21:47] <%BoxNavy> makes total sense
[0:21:49] <%HimakiLuvsU> Out of context?
[0:21:51] <GarbageQueenEllie> Do you want a hot New York Latina fox lady to chase you around and shoot shock bullets at you? Then play Sly Cooper.
[0:21:52] <marvel877> Pat, your minor complaints are COMPOUNDED by mindgoblins.
[0:21:52] <+Veraverse> Imagine being in 2020
[0:21:54] <%HimakiLuvsU> How so
[0:21:56] <majindusto> *Gameboy game
[0:21:58] <SnozTheRabbit> some things just don't make sense @based_lobster
[0:21:58] <Zetheos> it was fuckin' cool
[0:22:02] <%BoxNavy> you had to be there maaaaan
[0:22:02] <@BigNaturalMan59> whats your opinion on FFXI
[0:22:04] <benjisonfire> @BigCoffee no it didnt?
[0:22:05] <dinnydanny777> A lot of games were good for being handheld games
[0:22:05] <%Agami23> its a remake, they should have remade it better
[0:22:08] <bakkatohri> It's 2020 NG
[0:22:10] <%greasypete00> LUL
[0:22:10] <%BestTeaMaker> LUL
[0:22:14] <dinnydanny777> But are not great console games
[0:22:15] <%weissguard> BabyRage
[0:22:17] <majindusto> No they didn't
[0:22:18] <marvel877> They did not.
[0:22:18] <%HimakiLuvsU> Whatâ€™s your opinion on FFXV
[0:22:18] <@SSaryn> FUCK YOU IT'S YEAR!
[0:22:23] <bakkatohri> Anybody who says it's 2021, it's 2020 new game plus - you fools.
[0:22:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> The Switch is just a game boy you can connect to your TV
[0:22:29] <%Mendin> You should emulate the Gameboy original version so you can enjoy the game's amazingly robust sanity-checking as you snap it sideways with a warp glitch
[0:22:32] <KeiganOfAstora> ye ye ye

[0:24:33] <jakebreakshow> It's roughly 4:00pm for pat, if he's still in quebecland

[0:26:09] <%Nekros4442> Eh I get that. I never got into the explorathon games on N64
[0:26:10] <%Agami23> its almost like saying "i dont like it" is more complex than "this thing sucks" that most people WANT you to feel
[0:26:12] <%Mendin> Hey Pat, what is your thought on the Resident Evil 1 basement tune
