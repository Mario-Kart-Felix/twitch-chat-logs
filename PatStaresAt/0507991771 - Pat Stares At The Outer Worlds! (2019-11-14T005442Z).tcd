[0:04:00] <$DocMadfox> Cheer500 Finally caught up on your Outer Worlds stream and can watch live. You're coming up on the part that brought OW down for me, so I'm interested to see if you have the same reaction. Also on the note of Digimon fans being creepoy sex perverts, Gatomon - the small white cat Digimon - made me a furry. Because when I was 10 or 11 I watched her jumpkick a dinosaur. Thanks Japan! A cat is fine too.
[0:04:01] <%deviljhojho_> Here's hoping fallen order is good
[0:04:08] <+Cityscape17> same here
[0:04:12] <+kevlarkoala> I aint never watched da pat stream da games live before
[0:04:23] <+Cityscape17> I got it for the pc and my big fear is that it isnt playable on my rig

[0:04:29] <SpellCatty> Gatomon's Japanese VA has Ara Ara energy
[0:04:32] <shadytreeofknowledge> only reason I was in the fucking store was because the coworker was complaining ever fucking time and oh I didn't put what she said over what the manager said

[0:09:15] <%spitelite> the white redbull is awesome
[0:09:17] <+Mottyrob> I know Red Bull brought out a Cola over here, it tasted kinda weird but overall it was alright

[0:09:32] <%tizz86> @angriestpat i once drank 2 BFC of Monster in a night during my high school days. might've had a mild heart attack
[0:09:32] <%pilgrimsayswhat> I mean you drink Red Bull apatDab
[0:09:32] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> 5 Hour Energy doesn't do shit
[0:09:33] <ScreamLord> Redbull gives you Dooms
[0:09:35] <%cureneckbeard> I'll give you $5 if you can drink an entire can of original Monster on tomorrow's stream
[0:09:37] <+Cityscape17> so the issac side game :D
[0:09:37] <%DracaenaLeaf> yeyeye
[0:09:39] <%Ner234> Mix a Red Bull and a Monster. Achieve Godhood (or Death whichever happen first)
[0:09:40] <%SvenHolgersson> ONLY VILLAINS DO THAT
[0:09:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> FFUCK 5 hour energy
[0:09:43] <holydeviant1> 5 hour energy is just MEDICINE
[0:09:44] <%trashcansan> 5 hour energy is gross
[0:09:48] <%augusm> DRINK WAR
[0:09:50] <%deviljhojho_> more like 5 minute energy
[0:09:51] <@lewdskeletor13> Hitler threw back Red Bull like nobodies business
[0:09:55] <shadytreeofknowledge> fuck lying ass hoe coworkers @angriestpat
[0:09:57] <%pepzi_boyz> 5 hour energy is the crack of energy drinks
[0:09:59] <%Conyst> Only time I ever drank 5 hour energy it made me sick.
[0:10:01] <%CaptainPileDriver> i think so?
[0:10:01] <%ShaneWhite> Those tiny wanna be energy drinks
[0:10:04] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> No idea
[0:10:06] <DocMadfox> No
[0:10:06] <%deviljhojho_> those are some obscure refernces
[0:10:06] <%SvenHolgersson> nope
[0:10:08] <Supabait> 5 HOUR ENERGY? THAT DRINK WITH 8000% DAILY VITAMIN B12??
[0:10:09] <NSFW_Nurgle> @AngriestPat If you put on sunglasses, will you be allowed in be in p2?
[0:10:09] <%CaptainPileDriver> i don't remember
[0:10:11] <%trashcansan> unfortunately no :(
[0:10:13] <%President_Miyazaki> It's the one Rich Evans said tastes like burning.
[0:10:15] <%Typhaeon> Can only drink Bang, or 7/11's equivalent these days. No shitload of B vitamins like usual
[0:10:18] <+Mottyrob> It's supposed to shock you awake with absolutely shit flavour
[0:10:19] <%dalmek> no but I'm reminded of Lacroix being described as "the concept of grapefruit, in another room"
[0:10:24] <carzeri> am i the only one who drinks cola when I need my dose of sugar and energy? tastes much better
[0:10:26] <%cureneckbeard> 5 hour energy is only for Japanese corporate slaves who die at 45 of overwork
[0:10:29] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat I had a 5H once and it tasted like Peptobismol and crushed dreams

[0:43:31] <%spitelite> just get taller problem solved
[0:43:31] <%Conyst> Well then if you want longer legs stop breaking your ankles.
[0:43:35] <+TechGamer> @AngriestPat Have you thought about getting the LG C9 OLED??!
[0:43:38] <%dalmek> Do you still have warranty on those legs?
[0:43:39] <+Grayhammatter> just get regular legs 4Head
[0:43:40] <%realm_forge> Thanks to amazon you donâ€™t have to be embarrassed shopping in the kids section
[0:43:40] <%joylent_blue> somewhere on Monarch i think
[0:43:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Woolie sized
[0:43:48] <%derap41> Just put you nuts inside your knees
[0:43:50] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Dont even dream shortstack
[0:43:50] <%deviljhojho_> oh for sure tomatoReally
[0:43:50] <jhonxiolonn> interesting
[0:43:51] <%TheStarvingGood> you mean regular
[0:43:53] <tigerfang86> Don't think about Tall Pat
[0:43:53] <RagingLeo> we've seen THE picture. it'd be weird.
[0:43:53] <%SvenHolgersson> Thats a creepypasta
[0:43:54] <%CrabSlacks> MOON GANG
[0:43:55] <Zombiecancer12> that tall pat picture is scary though
[0:43:56] <%ShichiNoBushi> Get that surgery where they cut your bones and fasten something and let extra bone grow between them.
[0:43:56] <tigerfang86> DONT THINK ABOUT TALL PAT
[0:43:57] <StarkAvKnark> Regular sized Pat is a forever cursed image
[0:43:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> I forgot about the Moon Goons
[0:44:00] <%audrus> goon mang
[0:44:02] <%SGrim> Reminder: Tall Pat isn't real. He can't hurt you.
[0:44:02] <%joylent_blue> MOON GANG..... plus sam
[0:44:05] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat so do that thing like what Ethan Hawke does in Gattaca. Get em to break your legs and then use the screw things to lengthen them.
[0:44:06] <TechDragon_Z> Watchout for bombs.
[0:44:07] <+Shotgundam009> Get those robot legs
[0:44:07] <%thenumber5point5> get some ceiling stilts
[0:44:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> you'd be like 5'9, 5'10 probly?
[0:44:11] <%deviljhojho_> i cant believe HK9 is a cleaner bot on this universe
[0:44:12] <42nfl19> Therapist: It's ok. Tall Pat does not exist!
[0:44:12] <%SvenHolgersson> Tall Pat makes me uncomfortable
[0:44:15] <%CrabSlacks> Tall pat isn't real, he can't hurt you
[0:44:17] <tigerfang86> MOON GANG IS BACK
[0:44:22] <AMajorTom> Would you cut off your legs if you could grow longer ones over two years
[0:44:25] <%realm_forge> Youâ€™d look like dr robotnick
[0:44:27] <%deviljhojho_> gecko looking mfer
[0:44:27] <%Conyst> regular sized Pat
[0:44:28] <Monkeyweed21> HAVE YOU CONSIDERED ROBOLEGS
[0:44:31] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Like that scrawny tall mario from mario maker
[0:44:32] <%SvenHolgersson> It's like tall Mario its just....unholy
[0:44:33] <+TheSaintJohn> M O O N G A N G
[0:44:38] <%DriedLeafJuice> Regular-sized Pat wouldn't get as much views
[0:44:40] <%ShaneWhite> Your basically a Snorlax
[0:44:40] <$RubberFistFight> @CrabSlacks There's a knock on your door - IT'S TALL PAT!
[0:44:43] <%audrus> regular pat is an oxymoron
[0:44:43] <Mr_Strut> Pat is basically just Cotton Hill with knees
[0:44:44] <%cureneckbeard> Haha someone edited Pat to be Koichi
[0:44:47] <Lenmutt> isn't there a surgery for extending your legs?
[0:44:50] <nigawatts1988> That stat differences between the normal gear and the "2.0" gear is insane.
[0:44:52] <%UW_Duncan> jeez you're far
[0:44:53] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat get your jammies hemmed or rol them up you baby leg having ass gremlin <3
[0:44:55] <jhonxiolonn> Things are about to get cool, if he's siding with Zora
[0:44:56] <42nfl19> whitelist instead of blacklist?
[0:44:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> tall pat is an example of how comic book proportions are not real person proportions.
[0:45:11] <%joylent_blue> wait what patch
[0:45:16] <$LocDogX86X> its didn't
[0:45:17] <%pilgrimsayswhat> This still first playthrough?
[0:45:20] <Cory_the_Dinosaur> hbiVeto
[0:45:22] <%joylent_blue> yes pilgrim
[0:45:25] <%pilgrimsayswhat> kk
[0:45:26] <%thenumber5point5> keep 1 copy of each armor type.. for reasons
[0:45:31] <%Conyst> Fuck Graham he is a complete idiot.
[0:45:31] <%cureneckbeard> yeah pat just roll up the ends of your leg sleeves.
[0:45:33] <%derap41> What's in it
[0:45:38] <Fujiwara_92> Boomer
[0:45:39] <blackesteagle> boomer
[0:45:40] <$RubberFistFight> @Lenmutt there is, like i said, it happens in Gattaca. They basically saw through your lower leg bones, then put a device on them that you turn a screw on a little every day that keeps a tiny gap between the bones, so they heal longer.
[0:45:43] <jhonxiolonn> do that!
[0:45:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> Graham needs to DIE
[0:45:59] <%MaddyCaddy> Did pat already do both faction quest here?
[0:46:06] <jhonxiolonn> do the nyoka quest
[0:46:13] <%Ranryu692> It's pronounced Nye-oka
[0:46:25] <%AncelDeLambert> I've given up on Parvati's quest, I'm tired of how long it is

[0:46:41] <%Bluwizard21> @angriestpat save yourself some trouble save a spacers outfit a iconoclast outfit and a marauders outfit
[0:46:42] <%Ranryu692> you're definitely not beating this this week
[0:46:48] <+tkfromthe90s> @AngriestPat Hey Pat, just curious, what RPG that you've played within the last 10 years would you not mind living in?
[0:46:48] <+Shotgundam009> slack it good
[0:46:51] <%MaddyCaddy> He can beat it
[0:46:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> shut the fuck up hiram
[0:46:52] <jhonxiolonn> @AncelDeLambert it's not worth it, unless you like her
[0:46:55] <%cdrom321> You're still further than I am.
[0:47:01] <%joylent_blue> i like Hiram
[0:47:07] <%joylent_blue> he's a dick
[0:47:07] <primaryfire> @AncelDeLambert you can do it on the way to other quests for the most part
[0:47:08] <%Animorphimagi> Its fine. The combat is over in the game
[0:47:11] <jhonxiolonn> Hiram sucks
[0:47:15] <zipfile777> DxCat DrinkPurple cheer chat
[0:47:18] <%AncelDeLambert> @jhonxiolonn I kinda do, but this game has grown cold on me
[0:47:18] <+Cloudkiller91> Me too, Hiram's alright in my book
[0:47:23] <%deviljhojho_> good ol UDL

[0:47:26] <+edited156> Oh lawd this is only how far Pat is? Jeez
[0:47:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> hiram is a good character, because i hate him because I'm supposed to.
[0:47:44] <%Seraphile> oh i forgot that Hiram is a dick
[0:47:44] <jhonxiolonn> @AncelDeLambert yeah, i know that feel. Just forget about it and keep with the story
[0:47:53] <%thenumber5point5> he is only playing it on stream
[0:47:54] <%UW_Duncan> I love hiram
[0:48:10] <%nekodelic> Hiram is the kind of uncle that just doesn't want to be bothered ever
[0:48:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> @edited156 if he follows the main quest he could be done in like three or four hours.
[0:48:35] <%Conyst> yeah you want to save those clothes for later
[0:48:36] <%Seraphile> Hiram is just sick of everyones shit, yet other peoples shit is his buisness
[0:48:37] <%Ranryu692> @rumtumtugnutz Why would he do that?
[0:48:41] <Monkeyweed21> Talk to Zora first
[0:48:42] <%deviljhojho_> True enough
[0:48:45] <jhonxiolonn> wouldn't it be nice if the game had challenge and the armors and tinkering he spent points and money on, would mean something.
[0:48:47] <%cureneckbeard> the battery ran out yesterday
[0:48:49] <%MaddyCaddy> There's not a lot to do in Byzantium
[0:48:51] <+TheSaintJohn> you can talk to either first
[0:48:55] <%Seraphile> yeah talk to zora first
[0:49:02] <%deviljhojho_> this stream, and one more and it should be done
[0:49:06] <%deviljhojho_> probably
[0:49:12] <primaryfire> 2nd in command of the iconoclasts
[0:49:17] <%MaddyCaddy> Zora is the Iconoclast that doesn't suck
[0:49:18] <%Seraphile> lol
[0:49:19] <Monkeyweed21> Iconoclasts
[0:49:21] <%joylent_blue> yes
[0:49:22] <jam526879> iconoclast lady
[0:49:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> I was just pointing out that he's not really 'only' this far.
[0:49:26] <1matheuw> iconoclast leader that isnt a shithead

[0:50:01] <%AncelDeLambert> This is not shallow
[0:50:06] <%derap41> Pat have you heard what the gamers are complaining about in this game
[0:50:07] <roundii> More like BORE-A Magdoros
[0:50:08] <$RubberFistFight> lol shallow
[0:50:09] <tigerfang86> how can you like

[0:50:36] <%miguelrod777> you're welcome pat
[0:50:36] <%SvenHolgersson> Shallow implies that you're somehow in defense of capitalism and thats scary to think of
[0:50:37] <%deviljhojho_> good old one guy
[0:50:41] <%Saltmeisterr> mister ONE GUY
[0:50:43] <%MaddyCaddy> And then you get a prompt for Zora
[0:50:44] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Pat is always right
[0:50:46] <@lewdskeletor13> No yeah Sanjar is who you wanna talk to first
[0:50:48] <Monkeyweed21> Meant Zorah Magdoros OBVIOUSLY
[0:50:51] <$RubberFistFight> @AncelDeLambert people don't think before they say things these days. They just say words and then get pissy when people go "well, no."
[0:50:54] <dekkitout> Mediocre? Boy you see the dumb shit Game Freaks on atm
[0:50:55] <Cerabret100> Its definitely a bit shallow, but its good
[0:50:57] <primaryfire> hope your engineering is at 55 or more
[0:51:00] <sqointus> Raul Gillette, the best a man can get.
[0:51:00] <%thenumber5point5> after beating it I think it's a really good game and look foward to obsidian doing more with this universe
[0:51:10] <%Animorphimagi> You did this
[0:51:11] <%deviljhojho_> agreed
[0:51:14] <primaryfire> o
[0:51:15] <%MaddyCaddy> It's a good game, I just wish there was more in it
[0:51:15] <BlindGato> Whats with RODENTS chewing lines?!
[0:51:18] <%deviljhojho_> i want to see more games on this setting
[0:51:21] <%Conyst> I finished these without talking to him
[0:51:23] <%Cloudkiller91> Oh there's a quest for this? I just kind of did all that and left.
[0:51:25] <%derap41> Some gamers think this is sexist
[0:51:29] <jhonxiolonn> this game actually has some soul, unlike many recent titles. It just need to ge polished in some parts, i'm expecting the sequel to do it
[0:51:30] <%deviljhojho_> wh
[0:51:34] <%AncelDeLambert> @RubberFistFight I mean, I understand where's he's coming from, but hyperbole might not be the best tactic given how much everyone was rooting for Obsidian
[0:51:34] <@lewdskeletor13> This universe is primed for a sequel
[0:51:38] <$RubberFistFight> @SvenHolgersson remember, a solid, non-insignificant fraction of the world worship capitalism.
[0:51:42] <blackesteagle> its shallow compared to other Obs rpgs, plus this is way too woke, good think everybody hates bethesda so they ignore most negative shit about this game
[0:51:46] <%Conyst> buy the armor
[0:51:48] <%deviljhojho_> He has 2 exclusive weapons
[0:51:54] <%deviljhojho_> but nothing of value really

[0:52:19] <jhonxiolonn> @Dozale i wonder which games do you like? what is woke about this game lmao?
[0:52:23] <+BurkeBigsby> PLasma carbine is probably best bang for buck weapon.
[0:52:28] <%joylent_blue> oh no it denounces the evils of late-stage capitalism its W O K E

[0:53:46] <$RubberFistFight> @joylent_blue it doesn't even denounce it, to me it seems more to be pointing at examples of bad people exploiting capitalism in bad ways and saying "this is bad, but capitalism itself is not necessarily evil". There's actually nuance to it.

[0:55:21] <%derap41> Its confidence exercises
[0:55:25] <+Angrec> dude i loved this and the spaceship but the next zone and the first zone really killed my wanting to play this
[0:55:26] <$RubberFistFight> @AncelDeLambert I like that there's actually examples in-game of capitalism being leveraged for a positive outcome. You know, just like it can be in real life.
[0:55:27] <%nekodelic> @rubberfistfight I think it's more like capitalists are just as much victims of the system as the proletariat
[0:55:28] <CursedNobleman> its called an affirmation LUL
[0:55:30] <%thenumber5point5> ya this while quest line is "ya the governmental system is fucked up, but we are doing what we can to make it work"
[0:55:32] <dekkitout> Good shit, Sanny
[0:55:53] <Junkles> WHY IS WOOLIE IN THE PARTY
[0:55:58] <%deviljhojho_> LMAOOO
[0:55:59] <$RubberFistFight> @nekodelic "the system" is a non-entity though. That's the whole point. It's not "the system's" fault that people abuse it and use it to abuse others - it's the fault of the abusers.
[0:56:04] <%deviljhojho_> oh he is serious
[0:56:19] <%MightyMaxT> You know what's great? Doing a dumb playthrough. The options are hilarious
[0:56:19] <%Seraphile> at least you unlocked fast travel to rizzos
[0:56:20] <%Tearonex> oh boy the shit hole
[0:56:21] <%AncelDeLambert> ... shouldn't Pat already have it?
[0:56:28] <%deviljhojho_> such is life in halcyon
[0:56:28] <%Seraphile> @MightyMaxT they are
[0:56:30] <%pilgrimsayswhat> "These ratings from corrupt board members will totally help"
[0:56:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Back to Cascadia!
[0:56:33] <%Conyst> To Rizzos
[0:56:33] <%derap41> @RubberFistFight then we do we keep going on about systemic oppression
[0:56:34] <%joylent_blue> thank god i happened to have seen her evaluation already at this point
[0:56:40] <%AncelDeLambert> If Pat read Sanjar's, he should have read hers already too, right?
[0:56:47] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat It is STUPID
[0:56:48] <%Seraphile> no hers is at rizzos
[0:56:51] <%AncelDeLambert> ah, okay
[0:56:57] <%UW_Duncan> I got her review by accident
[0:56:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Should have explored tizzyâ€™s more
[0:57:04] <@lewdskeletor13> Itâ€™s especially dumb because his review reflected poorly on him so he should know their biased
[0:57:04] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm thinking of the other review, who I STILL don't know who it belongs too!!
[0:57:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Rizzo. Damn autocorrect
[0:57:14] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[0:57:19] <%PROUD2beGINGER> LUL
[0:57:20] <$RubberFistFight> @derap41 because "systemic" in that context means something totally different than when you refer to capitalism (or socialism, communism, etc) as "a system".
[0:57:23] <roundii> 30 meters? I barely know her!
[0:57:26] <%deviljhojho_> yeah tomatoReally
[0:57:26] <tigerfang86> you're STUMB

[0:58:17] <@lewdskeletor13> These guns are super effective on living people
[0:58:33] <%AncelDeLambert> boy, I love guns that are effective on living people
[0:58:33] <Monkeyweed21> is this Blizzard
[0:58:37] <%nekodelic> I'm glad this chat is not as toxic as most chats when it comes to discussing this sort of thing
[0:58:41] <%deviljhojho_> perhaps
[0:58:43] <%R3Roundabout> People discuss the intricate balance between individuals and the citizens within that system while Pat screams moon gang and 1 shots everything because he's on easy
[0:58:44] <%AncelDeLambert> so much better than guns that AREN'T effective on living people
[0:58:57] <%pilgrimsayswhat> It's unavoidable to talk about with the game being about what it is, but I'm glad it's been civil
[0:59:06] <%AncelDeLambert> @roundaboutrevengeance MOON GANG MOON GANG MOON GANG!
[0:59:10] <$RubberFistFight> @derap41 you can't blame bad decisions on a non-actor. It always comes down to the people who are actually performing the actions you're condemning. When somebody decides between profit and human rights, for example, for them to go "I couldn't help it, THE SYSTEM!" is facile and asinine.
[0:59:12] <jhonxiolonn> THat's because we're all mostly boomers and not zoom zooms

[1:06:28] <%AncelDeLambert> aaaaaarg I hate religion and politics and worst of all POLITICAL RELIGIONS
[1:06:33] <%Conyst> Would prefer if you go find an angry mantiqueen
[1:06:41] <%pilgrimsayswhat> This externalization of responsibility is disgusting dude
[1:06:44] <$RubberFistFight> @FoolsArcade wat
[1:06:44] <%trashcansan> this is some star trek bullshit
[1:06:48] <%Jrocy247> Graham is an insane fool and completely delusional
[1:06:55] <$LocDogX86X> Graham's head is far up his own ass

[1:08:14] <%joylent_blue> a road you didn't have to build PogChamp
[1:08:18] <%Seraphile> honestly it gives credit to the writing of this game that graham is more hateable than some of the moustache twirling corprates
[1:08:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Why did you shoot that pupper
[1:08:30] <%ape_hawk> yeah, heal on kill is pretty OP
[1:08:37] <%Conyst> Plasma spewing bug dogs
[1:08:38] <%Grimlockfly> I went to Monarch first instead of Roseway, and all these grubs murdered me
[1:08:39] <%Jrocy247> "Stand by for Titanfall"
[1:08:53] <%Grimlockfly> Save scummed monarch
[1:08:54] <$RubberFistFight> @Seraphile what I like is how he occasionally makes valid points, that you hate to acknowledge because of all the other shit.
[1:08:56] <%GarbageQueenEllie> woah
[1:09:07] <jhonxiolonn> the mind controlling weapon is broken , on companions

[1:10:10] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Boomer Beast
[1:10:17] <%Bluwizard21> pat as a left for dead boomer
[1:10:17] <SilverFaustX> atpOld
[1:10:18] <jhonxiolonn> Pat drinking a redbull instead of a monster
[1:10:19] <fearhurst> just need pat holding up a can of monster
[1:10:25] <%AncelDeLambert> silly Pat, you need plasma weapons for raks
[1:10:25] <$LocDogX86X> That Gloop is all kinds of fun
[1:10:30] <%Seraphile> wow i'm like 10 second delay
[1:10:30] <%joylent_blue> ah, visions of using Lift in Mass Effect
[1:10:33] <@lewdskeletor13> We already have that PatBoomer emote in the discord
[1:10:34] <ScreamLord> PFFFF
[1:10:36] <sqointus> Big compression
[1:10:48] <%Razputin217> BURNING
[1:10:48] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Boomer Beast, Boomer Beast, live with Mister Boomer Beast
[1:10:49] <%AncelDeLambert> that's RIGHT! We DO have Boomer Doppleganger Pat!
[1:10:53] <jhonxiolonn> get it
[1:10:55] <%AncelDeLambert> .... why
[1:10:57] <%Razputin217> TAKE
[1:11:04] <fearhurst> Pat has doubled down on corrosive, he will never taste the power of plasma
[1:11:05] <%AncelDeLambert> the perks SUCK, tho!
[1:11:05] <jhonxiolonn> because he's almost inmortal, that's why
[1:11:05] <%Jrocy247> ???
[1:11:07] <%trashcansan> PAT WAIT REMEMBER THE PROBLEM
[1:11:13] <%ape_hawk> take the +dmg while under negative effects perk next time
[1:11:22] <%crimsonharvest> shits blocked
[1:11:22] <%Conyst> yeah the plasma and corrosive are really good ones
[1:11:24] <@lewdskeletor13> Corrosive weakness is one of the better ones
[1:11:30] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @fearhurst everything dies so fast it hardly matters
[1:11:31] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> You got this Pat!
[1:11:32] <+jjjkopf> this is normal not hard right?
[1:11:37] <@lewdskeletor13> Yes
[1:11:37] <%AncelDeLambert> yes, normal
[1:11:37] <%joylent_blue> yes this is normal
[1:11:48] <jhonxiolonn> corrosive is so weak when enemies use it, but not when you use it
[1:11:49] <%Jrocy247> pussies
[1:11:56] <%Ranryu692> it's very cramped in there
[1:11:58] <%AncelDeLambert> honestly, advice one for new players trying this game is "immediately set to hard"
[1:12:05] <jhonxiolonn> also, pat is using an armor that has a lot of corrosive def
[1:12:06] <+griffball13> ULTRA
[1:12:07] <$RubberFistFight> @Seraphile you know why people hate that? Because it shatters the illusion that it's as simple as "good" and "bad" people. Like Walt Whitman said "Do I contradict myself? Very well, then I contradict myself, I am large, I contain multitudes"
[1:12:07] <%dalmek> "Corps"e. Good one
[1:12:09] <%joylent_blue> hearing Max be like "yeah.... i'm not going in there" is really funny
[1:12:13] <jhonxiolonn> nvm
[1:12:14] <%deviljhojho_> shit damn
[1:12:32] <%AncelDeLambert> Corrosive does GREAT on anything that's not a rapt
[1:12:44] <%AncelDeLambert> rapts don't have armor, just shittons of health
[1:12:52] <+jjjkopf> they don't let companions come with you because that would totally break they're pathing on the slope huh
[1:13:04] <%AncelDeLambert> the slope in this thing is ridiculous, yes
[1:13:06] <%Ranryu692> I love logs that mention you lol
[1:13:16] <%Jrocy247> LUL
[1:13:19] <%deviljhojho_> damn
[1:13:20] <%Conyst> Plasma for raptidons corrosive for everything else
[1:13:23] <tigerfang86> GOT EM
[1:13:26] <%joylent_blue> she is extremely calm considering
[1:13:34] <jhonxiolonn> Oh, you gunship engineer, how sazzy of you
[1:13:39] <%Jrocy247> She just doesn't give a fuck anymore
[1:13:40] <%ape_hawk> man, this game has a hard-on for women engineers
[1:13:42] <%trashcansan> ...wow
[1:13:44] <+jjjkopf> oh man I can relate to her too much
[1:13:46] <%Seraphile> I love this voice work

[1:13:49] <+griffball13> THE MOONINITES

[1:13:51] <tigerfang86> OOOOOOOOOOH
[1:13:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> I love her
[1:13:53] <%AncelDeLambert> MOONINITES!
[1:13:53] <%UW_Duncan> this is the best audiolog in the game
[1:13:53] <%Razputin217> quiettKek
[1:13:53] <%Ner234> Damn
[1:13:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> hah
[1:13:56] <%deviljhojho_> such is life
[1:13:56] <%AncelDeLambert> HOW DID I MISS THAT?!
[1:13:59] <cruz737> aqua teen hunger force reference?
[1:14:06] <fearhurst> dont forget to eject the key like I did
[1:14:06] <%joylent_blue> she's dead now :)
[1:14:08] <%AncelDeLambert> BIG ATHF ref
[1:14:09] <%marsanta> Engines: Technically functional
[1:14:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> Can she be a companion?
[1:14:11] <$RubberFistFight> @jjjkopf I mean, why not?
[1:14:11] <jhonxiolonn> SNAFU
[1:14:12] <%Conyst> ships fucked captain
[1:14:18] <pmtriox> is capitalism bad yet?
[1:14:27] <%Jrocy247> No need to panic when she knows she's about to die anyway
[1:14:28] <@lewdskeletor13> Yes
[1:14:32] <%deviljhojho_> LMAO
[1:14:37] <%pilgrimsayswhat> yep
[1:14:48] <fearhurst> they had no bathroom
[1:14:55] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat What perk did you get when you took the balding debuff?
[1:14:56] <%AncelDeLambert> they had to give you ONE gimme on this damn map
[1:14:58] <%pilgrimsayswhat> to Zora!
[1:14:58] <jhonxiolonn> you can now go give the module to nanjar
[1:15:01] <%joylent_blue> that thing looks radioactive
[1:15:06] <%GarbageQueenEllie> cronch
[1:15:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> kidney stone pain kickin in. Hello Oxy, my old friend.

[1:15:16] <%Razputin217> CRUNCH
[1:15:17] <%xcompleasedad> SHINS
[1:15:19] <%marsanta> To Zora~
[1:15:22] <%Jrocy247> That sound effect when you break your ankles is amazing
[1:15:23] <%Conyst> thus pat Becomes shorter
[1:15:28] <$RubberFistFight> I don't get it. Do people mock this game because they want it to be as simple as "capitalism bad" and it's NOT? Or because they THINK it's "capitalism bad" because they're too narrowminded to see that it isn't?
[1:15:34] <%Ranryu692> you can't miss Zora
[1:15:34] <%pilgrimsayswhat> ????
[1:15:35] <%Takreth> Every failed jump is another inch shorter
[1:15:42] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, I don't think Pat has found the flamethrower yet. Which I only mention because there's a cool reference next to it
[1:15:42] <%Seraphile> i bet your companions stay outside cause pathfinding in there is too much of a pain
[1:15:44] <jhonxiolonn> time for big Boys talk
[1:15:45] <shadytreeofknowledge> who zora
[1:15:47] <%CrabSlacks> who has the brokenest feet, Patron or norman reedus
[1:16:00] <@lewdskeletor13> Patron

[1:16:05] <+griffball13> ya probably
[1:16:07] <%joylent_blue> RubberFistFight definitely the latter in most cases
[1:16:08] <@lewdskeletor13> Heâ€™s broken his ankles so many times
[1:16:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Are Zora and Graham siblings? They look really similar
[1:16:10] <%ape_hawk> Zora is the Julie Farkas of this game
[1:16:11] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Remember that shortness is not an excuse for lack of power. I'm a full foot taller than my mom and she'd still kick my ass
[1:16:11] <+griffball13> HELL YES

[1:19:34] <%Conyst> Join together with Sanjar
[1:19:35] <ThirdPersonPhil> @AngriestPat first person hands in games get rendered on top of everything so it does not clip when you go close to a object
[1:19:36] <%realm_forge> Pats only used to seeing knees

[1:20:04] <%joylent_blue> sure.......
[1:20:06] <$RubberFistFight> that option right there is an example of "capitalism might be good"
[1:20:10] <%Conyst> kissing
[1:20:17] <pmtriox> they can if we kill the ever loving fuck out of the other corporations
[1:20:22] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Now KISS

[1:20:25] <%ape_hawk> Pat, its not that corporations are bad, just ones that dont have a soul... so, yknow, most of them
[1:20:27] <tigerfang86> HUGE kiss
[1:20:33] <Darkrenai> Diet Toothpaste
[1:20:34] <1matheuw> savescum
[1:20:34] <%ape_hawk> for instance, the MSI is a corporation
[1:20:35] <jhonxiolonn> remember that big church? well
[1:20:46] <SparkAfterDark> I hate when the "Persuade" option is basically just "Lie politely"
[1:20:46] <+Bluemanzee> Well certain capitalism. The corporation on Monarch certainly has better ideas for capitalism than the other corps
[1:20:51] <+griffball13> the law will oversee this meeting
[1:21:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> they're gonna smooch in the hat church
[1:21:06] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I like Capitalism, tho. It gives me different flavors of Oreo's, and 12 different kinds of cable
[1:21:10] <supahrob64> You can actual get a decent bunnyhop in this game
[1:21:17] <supahrob64> NOW DEBATE

[1:21:38] <@lewdskeletor13> Sanjar buddy calm yourself
[1:21:39] <CrowbarFacelift> point it back in
[1:21:40] <$RubberFistFight> @ape_hawk the problem is rampant amorality of the people in charge, and how willing they are to shrug the blame off and say "no but it's the system though".
[1:21:42] <%Conyst> I now pronounce you Sanjar and Zora
[1:21:42] <%FalseEyeD> No, whip it out more tho
[1:22:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> @garbagequeenellie capitalism hasn't given me chicken and waffles flavored oreos so I'm not convinced
[1:22:19] <Storm_Samurai> PHILOSPHISM FOR LIFE BITCHES
[1:22:29] <$RubberFistFight> @GarbageQueenEllie capitalism is incredibly useful in the right hands.
[1:22:31] <%deviljhojho_> ITS Happening
[1:22:33] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @rumtumtugnutz Fight for your right to cronch.
[1:22:43] <%RNGbob> RNGbob subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! So I share the mind goblin of hating temporary buffs, but in Outer Worlds consumables boosting base stats for skill/speech checks is okay to me. Are there times that your mind goblins are countered through specific design or whatever?
[1:22:43] <supahrob64> Well Graham is dead so there's that
[1:22:58] <%Conyst> He totally didn't know
[1:23:00] <tigerfang86> usedFeels
[1:23:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> Graham was a dirty slut
[1:23:08] <$RubberFistFight> @rumtumtugnutz no, but it HAS furnished you with access to appropriate resources to try and make a product like that yourself.
[1:23:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Graham Cracker was a cumbo
[1:23:19] <supahrob64> Graham was a slut for his words

[1:39:58] <%AncelDeLambert> "Crazy Parvy" is what they called her, the Mad Wrench of the system
[1:40:02] <%ape_hawk> i bet people would be more inclined to level the combat skills if they had the tinker cost cap perk for those weapons
[1:40:03] <dukenux> Can't fret over every broken egg.
[1:40:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> parcheesi has been on my team all game

[1:40:16] <SparkAfterDark> I didn't want to fuck over edgewater, and I didn't want to give the old bitch her revenge. But I just couldn't let the factory owner be RIGHT. If he was right he'd just keep abusing his workers even if he has more of a soul than vegan grama
[1:40:20] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Can I buy some Diet Toothpaste? I need that toxic post apocalyptic beach bod...
[1:40:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oooh boy...pain pills kickin in.
[1:40:29] <%deviljhojho_> one of the main themse of the game is that you cant go "FULL ANARCHY EAT THE RICH" because you are gonna fuck up a lot of inoccents on the way

[1:48:03] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat i don't think you geared up felix
[1:48:03] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I wish there was a game that was 100% Social Links. I guess that's just Dating Sims, huh?

[1:49:01] <%LodiFrostbeard> you need 7 sporilla asses
[1:49:04] <%ape_hawk> theres a reason this quest is so glandiose
[1:49:05] <%Jrocy247> Getting the Glands is so pointless
[1:49:06] <%CrabSlacks> get your fist up there and grab them glands
[1:49:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> different landing pad
[1:49:09] <dukenux> were do bear asses are from?
[1:49:09] <%MightyMaxT> It's a second port on scylla
[1:49:13] <dukenux> SoTT?
[1:49:15] <fearhurst> collect their glans, put them in lotion and sell them! @angriestpat
[1:49:15] <dekkitout> More glands? How sweaty are we getting exactly?

[1:49:43] <dekkitout> @blackesteagle Too soon, bruh
[1:49:55] <jhonxiolonn> yes
[1:50:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I wish there were more quests on this damn rock.
[1:50:10] <fearhurst> the entire combat system is incredibly easy
[1:50:11] <dekkitout> I'm sure some genius will mod it in...
[1:50:13] <dukenux> So do you recommend starting on hard? @AngriestPat
[1:50:16] <jhonxiolonn> level cap should have been 35
[1:50:22] <%Seraphile> I hope we get an old world blues like expansion
[1:50:23] <%R3Roundabout> Let's hope for a new game+ patch
[1:50:25] <%Animorphimagi> They really wanted a 30 level cap
[1:50:26] <blackesteagle> k, will waith another decade then
[1:50:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> tinker cap is 35
[1:50:34] <Junkles> dirty 30
[1:50:36] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Can't wait for you to get super frustrated playing DS again tomorrow after acclimating to this movement speed. LUL
[1:50:36] <dangodarterous> this looks like it feels like a borderlands game
[1:50:40] <%R3Roundabout> Or a new game + mod
[1:50:42] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Ya know, if you get enough of those Primal glands, you can synthesize your own Super-Booze
[1:50:49] <dukenux> Did Obsidian mention any DLCs?
[1:50:55] <%joylent_blue> LUL

[2:08:52] <Tomkins2244> You've never heard of a very polite Canadian revolutionary?
[2:08:54] <leinadtonu> no gods, no rules.
[2:09:03] <blackesteagle> this game will give pat "terminal" illness :P
[2:09:05] <leinadtonu> only elmo
[2:09:09] <%RNGbob> @AngriestPat what would you name a ship? Cat's Meow and the Unreliable are pretty good
[2:09:09] <$LocDogX86X> If only you could trade felix for the dog
[2:09:13] <%alphonseisbest> well his asking u to kill a dude, politely
[2:09:32] <%TDAWS_MP132> he told you earlier
[2:09:33] <%deviljhojho_> Metagaming
[2:09:35] <RubberFistFight> Ah jesus fucking christ I just discovered that a bushfire that destroyed a rainforest lodge that I LOVED and visited a bunch as a kid was caused by some fucking shit teenagers tossing lit ciggies into the bushes. Fucking little shitcunts.
[2:09:44] <%deviljhojho_> thats ok felix, being 20 is basically like being a child
[2:09:51] <Tomkins2244> Not just any guy, either. Someone who served with him in his revolution, if memory serves. The moment you stop being down for revolution means time to die.
[2:09:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @RubberFistFight Aw man, that sucks.
[2:10:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @RubberFistFight that sucks man, I'm sorry
[2:10:10] <%deviljhojho_> @RubberFistFight tomatoPain

[2:10:54] <%trashcansan> THE BABY
[2:10:57] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @bluwizard21 Godspeed
[2:10:59] <blackesteagle> Yes yes I think I saw a cat
[2:11:01] <Tomkins2244> Has Pat done the special Max quest yet?
[2:11:06] <RubberFistFight> @Tomkins2244 something like 80% of bushfires are started either accidentally or deliberately by people.
[2:11:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Tomkins2244 yeeep
[2:11:16] <dekkitout> That boy is optimized for doofy goodness
[2:11:32] <Tomkins2244> Awww...Damn, missed it. And is that what's happening down in Australia? Thought it was climate change causing most of the fires in Aus and Cali
[2:11:34] <%joylent_blue> don't think so Tomkins2244 not sure
[2:11:36] <%joylent_blue> oh
[2:11:38] <%joylent_blue> nvm
[2:11:41] <Monkeyweed21> I do that too
[2:11:42] <RubberFistFight> @Tomkins2244 some idiot started a fucking huge one recently by using an angle grinder in a dry area and not paying attention to where the sparks were going.
[2:11:50] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[2:11:50] <$LocDogX86X> thats fair Pat
[2:11:50] <%miguelrod777> time we'll spent
[2:11:58] <%RNGbob> did he thurston scream back at ya?
[2:11:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Tomkins2244 I'm sure climate change isn't helping. But other factors.
[2:12:00] <+ClaudeMcGarren> yea thats not weird cmonBruh
[2:12:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @RubberFistFight Are there any plans to rebuild the lodge?
[2:12:14] <%AncelDeLambert> I need a big SUCC
[2:12:14] <Tomkins2244> Despite living in a state composed of 90 forests nobody starts fires around here even accidentally, it's baffling
[2:12:18] <Tomkins2244> 90%
[2:12:22] <dekkitout> @RubberFistFight That's usually how a lot of them start out here in Cali and Arizona
[2:12:44] <RubberFistFight> @Tomkins2244 the problem isn't climate anything, it's a failure to correctly regulate the amount of what is essentially fuel that's just lying about waiting to be set on fire by some dipshit with a grinder or some shitcunt with a lit ciggie. Or, you know, a crazy fucking firebug doing it deliberately.
[2:13:02] <RubberFistFight> @GarbageQueenEllie probably, it's fucking iconic. Binna Burra in Queensland.
[2:13:11] <%trashcansan> marriage contract?
[2:13:15] <Tomkins2244> Even the uhhh...I forget the name. Notre Dame? The famous church burned down from people being careless. So I guess it can be both sometimes.
[2:13:24] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @RubberFistFight I'm glad.
[2:13:27] <blackesteagle> I wouldn't even if I wanted to... hmn
[2:13:29] <leinadtonu> @rubberfistfight People can't be triste around nature. we need more bears.
[2:13:32] <RubberFistFight> Me too, Ellie.
[2:13:34] <%TheTakkster> @trashcansan Technically even a normal marrage is a contract
[2:13:35] <%Seraphile> marriage having active renewal isn't a half bad concept
[2:13:53] <%TheTakkster> "Do we wanna keep this going"
[2:14:02] <leinadtonu> @rubberfistfight *trusted
[2:14:08] <%TheTakkster> "Yes, of course. For our taxes."
[2:14:10] <%trashcansan> @TheTakkster true
[2:14:12] <Tomkins2244> We must tax marriage in the future, pay for the contract, pay to renew, pay to divorce, pay for marital sex, the works
[2:14:16] <RubberFistFight> @Tomkins2244 you can't really say a building burning down is climate change, though.
[2:14:30] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat How do you rank the companions from worst to best?
[2:14:32] <%joylent_blue> STEAL
[2:14:34] <Tomkins2244> For buildings, for sure not. But for drybrushes I'd believe it.
[2:14:37] <dekkitout> And I thought the marriage industry was bloodthirsty now...
[2:14:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> sam > all
[2:14:49] <Goldenwolf98> Parvarti is my fave
[2:14:52] <%MelBrooksKA> @RubberFistFight Changes the climate of the house
[2:14:55] <FunkyStreams> SAM
[2:15:07] <%joylent_blue> Parv > Max > Ellie > SAM > Felix > Nyoka
[2:15:08] <%deviljhojho_> max is best, ellie, then parvati, sam, and then nyoka and felix
[2:15:12] <Ragnakawaii> Ellie is the bomb
[2:15:15] <%Animorphimagi> Cannon order
[2:15:16] <leinadtonu> Sam is awesome near the end.
[2:15:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> SAM > cheese > rest
[2:15:21] <%Bluwizard21> @angriestpat parvati #1 pure cinnamon roll
[2:15:22] <%deviljhojho_> actually put sam over parvatti
[2:15:29] <blackesteagle> who don't peoplez like felix
[2:15:30] <%GarbageQueenEllie> "Nyoka, I TOLD you not to use my hair dryer! You ALWAYS set it to be too hot!"
[2:15:32] <%TheTakkster> Nyoka and Parvati have outstanding dialogue together
[2:15:33] <%MightyMaxT> Parv, Ellie, Nyoka, Sam, Felix, Max
[2:15:33] <%deviljhojho_> hell yeah brother
[2:15:33] <Tomkins2244> Ellie is definitely my favorite. Something about being a medic but also a pirate is awesome to me.
[2:15:36] <roundii> Nyoka isn't bad but she's really loud during battles and it can get kinda grating
[2:15:38] <dekkitout> I really appreciate Max's avuncular candor
[2:15:39] <RubberFistFight> Australia's ALWAYS been a bushfire-prone country. Always. Throughout its entire history. It's a big, flat, hot, dusty and WINDY nation. Bushfire season starts and ends the same time every year, always has. Approaches to how it's prepared for have suddenly shifted though for nebulous reasons, and now all of a sudden we're dealing with significantly worse firestorms.
[2:15:46] <Goldenwolf98> But he isnt as good as HK 47
[2:15:48] <%GarbageNirvana> All SAM's concerned with is cleaning
[2:15:51] <%joylent_blue> Felix is a snotnosed anarchist
[2:15:53] <+jjjkopf> SAM is my favorite since he's just a robot
[2:15:55] <rosemon5001> beep boop and shit @AngriestPat
[2:15:59] <%trashcansan> yes
[2:16:00] <%waifoong98> That's normal LUL
[2:16:02] <Tomkins2244> It is very on fire.
[2:16:03] <+bromontana> I liked max at first but got really bored with him after his quest
[2:16:05] <Ion_Laser> yeah
[2:16:05] <+Meow0369> I've never had leaves fall from the sky but now I'm getting burnt leaves just falling from the sky
[2:16:06] <%ShichiNoBushi> If you had a robotic servant, Pat, how human in form and personality would you like it to have?
[2:16:06] <%Seraphile> its been on fire for a week
[2:16:06] <DocMadfox> Probably
[2:16:06] <%DonatelloJose> Does Sam actually do anything interesting though?
[2:16:11] <NeroInfinite> It's always on fire
[2:16:12] <%GarbageNirvana> Doesn't matter what kinda shit you get into, SAM will clean it up
[2:16:15] <+Meow0369> Literally just piles of burnt up leaves falling from the sky
[2:16:17] <Monkeyweed21> AUSTRALIA IS STEALING CALIFORNIA'S SHTICK
[2:16:18] <leinadtonu> everything is on fire.
[2:16:22] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat Yeah we're super on fire here at the moment. The other day it was smoky as shit for like half a week, so much so that going outside made my eyes hurt.
[2:16:24] <roundii> SAM bangs the ship
[2:16:25] <%miguelrod777> apatPorgmo
[2:16:28] <%MelBrooksKA> @RubberFistFight I mean, that's kinda how deserts usually are
[2:16:30] <Tomkins2244> Cali and Aus are very on fire currently, but Australia more than usual. It's very concerning.
[2:16:31] <roundii> Bender-style
[2:16:32] <%trashcansan> it's either on fire or covered in poisonous beasts and plants
[2:16:33] <%joylent_blue> apatPorgmo
[2:16:34] <DocMadfox> @DonatelloJose If you have the Robophobia flaw all dialogue with him changes to you screaming in terror
[2:16:35] <%bread_assassin> @AngriestPat Did you see the Yakuza 7 trailer from yesterday?
[2:16:37] <%Seraphile> @Monkeyweed21 california literally imported our shtick with gum trees
[2:16:43] <%Jrocy247> THERE GOES MY HERO~
[2:16:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> is Australia ever not on fire? I hear there are trees there that reproduce by exploding.
[2:16:48] <NeroInfinite> WHY DID I HE FLOAT INTO SPACE?!?
[2:16:51] <ãƒŸãƒ¥ã‚¦ãƒ¬4242> i'd be worried if Australia stopped being on fire. the spiders might start building rafts and forging passports and stuff.
[2:16:53] <%TheTakkster> The goo gun is far and away the best science weapon
[2:17:02] <Goldenwolf98> TRASH MEN TRASH MEN TRASH MEN
[2:17:12] <RubberFistFight> @MelBrooksKA exactly. And if you suddenly stop disposing of all the dead trees and grass and shit that are lying around, you're gonna get an increase in fires. It shits me that people won't acknowledge that and label anybody that tries a "denier".
[2:17:13] <Tomkins2244> Pat, have you experienced any of the ragdoll physics from New Vegas in here? It seems every time I sneak sniper rifle someone they rubberband into the atmosphere. I love it.
[2:17:18] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat Are you going to get the Yakuza 7 demo?
[2:17:19] <dekkitout> All this talk about wildfires reminds me of a big fire in Cali back in 06 or 08 where I distinctly recall going outside thinking" Hey, what's all this white stuff falling from the sky?"
[2:17:21] <+Meow0369> So I didn't see why, but why isn't pat playing delivery man simulator today?
[2:17:29] <RubberFistFight> It's basic fucking mathematics. If there's more shit lying around to burn, then MORE SHIT WILL BURN.
[2:17:34] <Monkeyweed21> walk foward
[2:17:39] <FunkyStreams> @AngriestPat did you use the .ini tweak to turn off chromatic aberration?
[2:17:39] <%bread_assassin> JPN only, though.
[2:17:41] <ãƒŸãƒ¥ã‚¦ãƒ¬4242> yakuza7 is way different. all the bitching is gonna be funny.
[2:17:44] <%MelBrooksKA> shit + more shit = more fire
[2:17:46] <%Jrocy247> @Tomkins2244 It's there but not has much as NV was
[2:18:11] <flyingavocad0s> Go east
[2:18:16] <Tomkins2244> I think if you use the automatic sniper rifle + time dilation you can 'force' it to happen a lot more. I sent a lot of mantisaurs to space.
[2:18:18] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Wow, Patron's legs. You're so BRAVE
[2:18:22] <%Jrocy247> *Heavy
[2:18:25] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat Need a JPN account for the demo
[2:18:30] <%bread_assassin> I played a bit of the Yakuza 7 demo,earlier. I liked it,but being JPN only made it difficult to know what my skills did without trial and error.
[2:18:37] <%GarbageNirvana> It's a bit front-loaded
[2:18:38] <jhonxiolonn> some people think emerald vale is bad and too cartoonish
[2:18:48] <Monkeyweed21> thats not Guillermo
[2:18:50] <%MightyMaxT> Nah, he's in Death Stranding
[2:18:52] <+ChiefWilly> i think this game is good in almost every aspect; not great, but good
[2:18:56] <jhonxiolonn> it was written by different people too
[2:18:57] <blackesteagle> roseway looks better
[2:19:00] <%deviljhojho_> everyone loved it
[2:19:01] <RubberFistFight> @MelBrooksKA the worst part is that due to the fires having a lot more fuel available now, they're getting so hot that they're completely sterilizing the soil, which is wrecking the regrowth potential. A lot of Australian native trees are desert trees and require fire to crack their seeds so they can germinate - but if the soil is barren then they can't grow.
[2:19:08] <dekkitout> Too bad there's no icy-desolate-Hellscape planet
[2:19:11] <breakerdsx> You can tell that this game was made on a limited budget
[2:19:16] <Tomkins2244> I'm hoping two (three?) DLC planets will be super high quality with a lot of reason to stick around, and not a 5 minute detour for quests like Syclla is.
[2:19:22] <%deviljhojho_> "no tomatoSmile "
[2:19:37] <%TheTakkster> I hope every DLC is on the scale of Old World Blues
[2:19:41] <%Animorphimagi> They wanted to show tons of capitalist perspectives
[2:19:42] <+ChiefWilly> I feel like it wasn't finished- or rather planned much more but spent time on polish instead
[2:19:53] <%GarbageNirvana> This game is very good at showing people that other people can do the Bethesda formula, hopefully Obsidian gets the chance to give us something more robust in the future
[2:19:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[2:19:56] <%R3Roundabout> Emerald vale is too self contained to play into a larger narrative. Everything else has to play into the ending. I enjoyed it, but I'm interested to see how you feel about it.
[2:20:08] <dekkitout> "Gasp! D: "
[2:20:11] <Tomkins2244> Gasp...Harlow wasn't being entirely honest?!
[2:20:31] <jhonxiolonn> Pat's mind: "THE BOARD? CAPITALISM? MURDER TIME!"
[2:20:34] <%Seraphile> harlow needs to be dumped into the trash
[2:20:35] <Goldenwolf98> @GarbageNirvana I mean they are showing off a new IP at XO19 tomorrow apparently
[2:20:36] <blackesteagle> KDC was also bethesda style game
[2:20:37] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Harlow? More liek Harlo standards....eh.... GOTEEM
[2:20:43] <%GarbageNirvana> @Goldenwolf98 Oh cool
[2:20:50] <fearhurst> board asshead
[2:20:50] <rovilm> is this game a 7/10
[2:20:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeyeyeye
[2:20:57] <dekkitout> Manufactured revolutions are the best kind!
[2:21:13] <%Bluwizard21> @angriestpat trask to task?!
[2:21:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> nah, fuck da Board. After the shit I saw on Byzantium...fuck em hard.
[2:21:14] <Junkles> [Temperance] Yeah I'll kill the guy
[2:21:18] <FunkyStreams> @rovilm 7.5/10 if that means anything. Juuust above mediocre.
[2:21:23] <rovilm> Ah ok
[2:21:30] <Tomkins2244> Tfw you're allegedly working for who you're claiming to hate
[2:21:39] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Permission to commit the crimes? but that's my FAVORITE

[2:22:31] <blackesteagle> 17 hours to new Obsidian IP HYPE PogChamp
[2:22:33] <Tomkins2244> I like this quest because both of them seem hard to believe. Raising a tiny outlaw rebellion against mega-7-system-big-corportation? Nah. But the guy raising a rebellion working for them? Also skeptical.
[2:22:44] <dekkitout> That sounds like a cool name
[2:22:45] <spacecatstreams> @blackesteagle new IP?
[2:23:05] <dekkitout> The Microsoft event reveal? @blackesteagle
[2:23:07] <blackesteagle> @spacecatstreams yeah, they'll announce a game at X019
[2:23:08] <FunkyStreams> @blackesteagle Obsidian announces 'The Inner worlds'
[2:23:18] <breakerdsx> Good thing there's fast travel
[2:23:20] <Tomkins2244> Obsidian would announce 'The Inner Wilds'
[2:23:21] <Goldenwolf98> Yeah it aint great
[2:23:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> epic gamers rise up
[2:23:26] <+SuperMonkey2> the outerer worlds
[2:23:36] <%GarbageNirvana> It's Mass Effect backtracking
[2:23:37] <RubberFistFight> fucking christ those shitcunt teenagers aren't even getting in any trouble for starting a fucking bushfire. Christ governments here are a bunch of pissweak hand-sitting losers.
[2:23:39] <RubberFistFight> Ugh.
[2:23:41] <fearhurst> I mean at least you can fast travel to the ship
[2:23:42] <moosemonkey397> Ellie's is shourt as hell, thankfully
[2:23:44] <%GarbageNirvana> Which was fine for when Mass Effect came out
[2:23:44] <Goldenwolf98> Harlow

[2:24:12] <%GarbageQueenEllie> yes, boss?
[2:24:12] <%Ranryu692> you haven't unlocked it yet
[2:24:12] <%Big_Dream> you wont yet
[2:24:13] <%marsanta> You get it later at Byzantium
[2:24:14] <Tomkins2244> You can't get Ellie's quest until the final 10% of the game
[2:24:17] <+bromontana> Ellie is later
[2:24:18] <Fujiwara_92> Its later
[2:24:18] <fearhurst> @angriestpat ellie's quest is at Byzantium
[2:24:18] <%nekodelic> Ellie is in Byzantium
[2:24:20] <%Animorphimagi> Main story
[2:24:20] <%Big_Dream> you dont have it yet
[2:24:21] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> we live in rise up society
[2:24:22] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat Ellie's companion quest happens when you reach a certain world
[2:24:24] <+JonathLP> Ellie's is later
[2:24:24] <%bread_assassin> Have to land on Byzantium for her quest.
[2:24:26] <ãƒŸãƒ¥ã‚¦ãƒ¬4242> tell me you have sam's one thing for the bug. there's only one way to deal with bugs.
[2:24:31] <leinadtonu> it's in elisyum
[2:24:37] <%deviljhojho_> they are tho right?
[2:24:39] <%deviljhojho_> right?
[2:24:54] <FunkyStreams> Dr. Space Pirate seems a bit jaded.
[2:24:55] <ãƒŸãƒ¥ã‚¦ãƒ¬4242> hotdogs of the sea.
[2:24:56] <dekkitout> Ar-are fish sticks not made of saltuna? monkaS
[2:24:56] <%MightyMaxT> This is a solid 8.5/10, if they ever make an Outer Worlds 2, I'm excited for the improvements they make
[2:25:02] <jhonxiolonn> Ellie is better than Parvati
[2:25:05] <Tomkins2244> Are you saying mankind will go back to war after years of peace? Never. Sure it happened on Earth, but in space? Never.
[2:25:08] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @AngriestPat Did you know the colour orange is named after the fruit. Before that it was considered to be red. Which is why you and Paige are called redheads.
[2:25:13] <%DonatelloJose> She is the definition of jaded
[2:25:22] <dekkitout> Well said, Ellie
[2:25:22] <%deviljhojho_> ellie is comic relief
[2:25:25] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Ellieâ€™s rampant pessimism honestly annoyed the shit out of me
[2:25:29] <HeadsHeldHigh> ^

[2:25:34] <%TheTakkster> Ascot
[2:25:35] <Tomkins2244> Ellie's quest feels very strange. She goes from jaded to tsundere.
[2:25:52] <%deviljhojho_> @Tomkins2244 its fucking funny
[2:25:54] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Everybody sucks, fuck everything, AAAAGH the angst! Gimme some black coffee!
[2:25:55] <%TIME_PUNCHER> She can. And she will
[2:25:55] <%UW_Duncan> Ellie sucks
[2:25:57] <blackesteagle> ellie's voice was better in the announcement gameplay

[2:26:24] <Tomkins2244> She's still the best girl. I still can't get over how good the faces in this game look. Maybe because I'm used to playing Skyrim and poop face games.
[2:26:24] <%MightyMaxT> Parvati slowly breaking down Ellie's walls really helped me like her, glad they were my two companions
[2:26:29] <breakerdsx> You can go straight from inside the Ship to the Region you want to go to. Saves one quick travel prompt

[2:26:55] <Tomkins2244> I had Felix and Ellie as my main companions and it was mostly Ellie shitting all over Felix every new area. It was kind of great.

[2:27:28] <%joylent_blue> apatBig BUG
[2:27:28] <jhonxiolonn> this game actually has almost no bugs, it's impressive, but this one
[2:27:29] <+Vaatura> what happen???
[2:27:32] <fearhurst> QA tested obsidian game
[2:27:35] <%deviljhojho_> This is the first bug I'vve EVER seen
[2:27:35] <dekkitout> *Reloads Save* Ship's Haunted
[2:27:36] <%Toast_Master_General> Yay bugs
[2:27:41] <%pilgrimsayswhat> I really wish there were dialogue options to call Ellie a fucking loser
[2:27:41] <korth367> `what even happened
[2:27:42] <Fujiwara_92> Reload and do Nyoka first
[2:27:43] <Ki_Memento> sounded like a botched quest
[2:27:44] <%TheTakkster> Was that the bug that hard kills Nyoka on supernova mode?
[2:27:49] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat What are you what the fucking about? Many people BIG confusion...
[2:27:56] <Tomkins2244> Every new place we visited was Felix saying he wants to be a pirate and Ellie saying he had to take the pirate vow of silence. And never speak again. Then every time he spoke she was like now what did I say about the pirate rule of silence?
[2:27:56] <%MelBrooksKA> Still 99% less bugs than Bethesda
[2:27:56] <%deviljhojho_> @pilgrimsayswhat the game does that for you later so its fine
[2:27:59] <TheWe4pon> just got here what happened?
[2:28:05] <Graxe_> There's a bug where they can climb an invisible ladder in the kitchen that leads to nowhere, which ends up killing them.
[2:28:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @pilgrimsayswhat There should be dialogue options to call everyone a fucking loser. Just shit on everybody
[2:28:11] <%TheTakkster> ^
[2:28:15] <Graxe_> Only seen it with Parvati, though
[2:28:15] <dekkitout> Alcoholism caught up to her?
[2:28:16] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @deviljhojho_ I beat it and didnâ€™t see that
[2:28:17] <Ragnakawaii> Her liver failed
[2:28:18] <FunkyStreams> Pat shit his pants cus his spaceship is now haunted.
[2:28:19] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Huh
[2:28:22] <HeadsHeldHigh> SAM is NOT a loser
[2:28:27] <%joylent_blue> ew
[2:28:30] <%Ner234> SAM fucks
[2:28:33] <+TheBigO75> robot sex
[2:28:33] <Tomkins2244> Nyoka's quest is very long so strap in
[2:28:33] <%pilgrimsayswhat> NO SPOILS
[2:28:38] <fearhurst> SAM be touching it up
[2:28:41] <%Ranryu692> SAM kinda sucks
[2:28:41] <%deviljhojho_> @pilgrimsayswhat did you do the sidequest tho
[2:28:43] <FunkyStreams> AND cleans up after himself
[2:28:45] <$LocDogX86X> Ada micLove Sam
[2:28:47] <leinadtonu> Careful, the dead companions bug can alter the ending.
[2:28:47] <%MightyMaxT> Quests glitch sometimes. I failed Parvati's quest out of the blue. Reloading and just doing it fixes it
[2:28:56] <blackesteagle> I'm a dirty digital astrogator SAAAM
[2:28:57] <%DonatelloJose> Sam cleans all the good parts
[2:28:59] <Tomkins2244> I was honestly surprised SAM didn't have a romance scene in this game.
[2:29:06] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Spoiler alert, Nyoka's quest involves dying her hair green instead of red
[2:29:14] <%deviljhojho_> Ã‘oka
[2:29:22] <%Frostiesaurusrex> @angriestpat who is your favorite companion?
[2:29:24] <fearhurst> never have a survival mode in a game that has bugs
[2:29:26] <%TheTakkster> Sam is having a romance scene every time you see him on the ship
[2:29:29] <dekkitout> @GarbageQueenEllie You have to be joshing us
[2:29:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nokia
[2:29:37] <%deviljhojho_> vicar max is great with a melee builds
[2:29:37] <Goldenwolf98> No the ship fucks HIM
[2:29:45] <+JonathLP> Fucks the shit out of who?
[2:29:47] <dekkitout> Next you're gonna say she gets replaced by a superior clone
[2:29:48] <flyingavocad0s> @angriestpat you can teleport directly from the ship instead of going outside first
[2:29:52] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @dekkitout And then she insists on using R1 on all the npcs
[2:29:59] <Goldenwolf98> ADA is definitely the top in that relationship Kappa
[2:30:00] <ãƒŸãƒ¥ã‚¦ãƒ¬4242> sam & max forever.
[2:30:01] <%bevyrage> @JonathLP sam fucks the SHIP
[2:30:09] <Tomkins2244> ADA doesn't count, though now that you mention it ADA had that 'ship clean' scene like....7 times in my playthrough. It kept happening constantly to the point I was just trying to skip through it.
[2:30:10] <FunkyStreams> omg this game on normal, just wow.
[2:30:22] <breakerdsx> From inside the ship, if you go from Map>Region you can go directly to the location without having to touch the ship door. Saves a loading screen if that annoys you.
[2:30:27] <Dakuu75> PSA: all corpses are friendly
[2:30:30] <Monkeyweed21> give him the stick
[2:30:41] <%deviljhojho_> i had to up the difficulty with my melee character because everything was dying too fast
[2:30:49] <%deviljhojho_> difficulty is wack
[2:30:52] <Tomkins2244> I actually found out about the Map>Region skip only near the very end of the game and was very...Sad. All those wasted loading times.
[2:30:57] <%joylent_blue> breakerdsx that is a lifesaver on console
[2:30:58] <FunkyStreams> Is there anything beyond Mk.2?
[2:31:03] <%deviljhojho_> no
[2:31:05] <FunkyStreams> and ultra
[2:31:10] <%deviljhojho_> also no
[2:31:12] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Can't believe Pat killed Nyoka like that
[2:31:14] <Tomkins2244> The Ultra Hunting Rifle <3
[2:31:15] <HeadsHeldHigh> There's a mod out that gets rid of all the gunk in Supernova (limited saves and whatnot)
[2:31:19] <blackesteagle> Its hard to balance a game which can be completed in 12 mins
[2:31:19] <ãƒŸãƒ¥ã‚¦ãƒ¬4242> i suppose you could just not have companions to increase difficulty, but thay say funny things.
[2:31:27] <dekkitout> Is that a consistent problem in these kind of games- regardless of the developers?
[2:31:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I love the Dead Eye rifle
[2:31:35] <Tomkins2244> There's really good perks for having no companions, but the dialogue D:
[2:31:36] <HeadsHeldHigh> Supernova's difficulty was pretty good I thought
[2:31:36] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Just jettisoned her out the airlock. Cold as ice
[2:31:40] <%Animorphimagi> Hardest quest
[2:31:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat not looting?
[2:31:42] <+Tcollins89> There always seems to be a plethora of games to be played right before Christmas.
[2:32:08] <Tomkins2244> Wait, Pat's random murder spree of black NPC's continues in Outer Wilds? Oh god. It's Deus Ex all over again...
[2:32:14] <%DonatelloJose> I did this fight early and it was BRUTAL
[2:32:15] <breakerdsx> Mmmm gland
[2:32:17] <FunkyStreams> Acid AR vs. Mantisaur= Profit.
[2:32:27] <ãƒŸãƒ¥ã‚¦ãƒ¬4242> Tcollins89, but only like 20% max are worth playing.
[2:32:32] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> saaad nokia
[2:32:33] <FunkyStreams> Cant wait for this anticlimatic boss battle.
[2:32:33] <Junkles> ok wooler
[2:32:36] <%Animorphimagi> Missed TONS of lore
[2:32:45] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Her eyes are defaulted to drunk every new dialogue lmao
[2:32:55] <%DonatelloJose> LORE thrown in the trash
[2:33:13] <%GarbageQueenEllie> oh yea her eyes look pretty red, geez
[2:33:14] <fearhurst> entire game I just used plasma, even on mantisaurs, and I played it on hard
[2:33:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> apart from terraform the planet PROPERTY FUCKERS
[2:33:23] <+Tcollins89> @ãƒŸãƒ¥ã‚¦ãƒ¬4242 (mule4242) true!
[2:33:36] <Tomkins2244> I never even used the Shrink Gun in the game despite getting it early on >-< never used any of the sciene weapons RIP
[2:33:42] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Even Nyoka is less emo than Ellie and she watched her friends fucking die.
[2:33:49] <fearhurst> shrink gun sucks a fat one
[2:33:55] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Me neither Tomkins
[2:34:00] <jhonxiolonn> make sure you keep thos medallions
[2:34:07] <%DonatelloJose> Are any of the science weapons actually good?
[2:34:14] <fearhurst> you will rarely be able to attack something while it is shrunk because it lasts like 1 second
[2:34:15] <Tomkins2244> I kept saying I'd use it on a Marauder but forgot to even try using it on the final boss
[2:34:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> untill monarch killed u
[2:34:20] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @TIME_PUNCHER It's the cropped haircut, man- it makes you more irritable, somehow...
[2:34:21] <%TIME_PUNCHER> The Prismatic Hammer is good
[2:34:25] <fearhurst> the prismatic hammer is busted
[2:34:35] <Tabonline> @AngriestPat CHARON took the kids
[2:34:38] <%torontototoro> This is the best companion quest imo. Most of them are pretty meh :/
[2:34:41] <ãƒŸãƒ¥ã‚¦ãƒ¬4242> if by good you mean fun, most of them. DonatelloJose
[2:34:41] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Prismatic Hammer even allows ranged attacks IIRC
[2:34:43] <%DonatelloJose> Sick, Iâ€™ll have to go look for it
[2:34:46] <Tomkins2244> The doc's rifle is pretty good too if that counts as a science weapon, used it as soon as I got it
[2:34:49] <jhonxiolonn> TUrok 2 musi
[2:34:51] <Junkles> hackbo
[2:34:56] <%pilgrimsayswhat> AWWWWW
[2:35:08] <%MightyMaxT> 15 seconds
[2:35:08] <fearhurst> phin's force is worse than any dead eye rifle so I threw it away
[2:35:11] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[2:35:11] <HeadsHeldHigh> LUL
[2:35:13] <+Caped_Eggy> Felix?
[2:35:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> aaaAAAaaaAAAAAHHH
[2:35:15] <Tomkins2244> You completed one part of the quest Kappa
[2:35:22] <$LocDogX86X> those screams
[2:35:23] <$LocDogX86X> lol
[2:35:34] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Goop Gun is great for crowd control
[2:35:37] <%xcompleasedad> At level 25........
[2:35:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> BIG CUMMIY SCREMS
[2:35:40] <RagingLeo> Pat's complete disinterest while the horrifying screams are bellowing in the background is amazing. LUL
[2:35:44] <%joylent_blue> laughably easy he says over the anguished screams of his friends
[2:35:53] <%Kirby_Sauce> maybe if you didn't play on easy
[2:35:58] <jhonxiolonn> lv 25 and normal mode, okay
[2:35:59] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Is't the level cap 30?
[2:36:02] <FunkyStreams> Also it doesn;t seem like the enemies lvls scale with your on Hard.
[2:36:05] <Tomkins2244> I was kind of sad about the level cap being so low
[2:36:10] <%GarbageNirvana> Try doing a solo supernova run, see how easy it is then
[2:36:12] <Goldenwolf98> yeah I had to bump the difficulty up to hard normal feels like it was meant to be easy mode instead
[2:36:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> these corpses are remarkably well preserved.
[2:36:33] <leinadtonu> It was super easy on hard. I had the prismatic hammer tho.
[2:36:43] <%deviljhojho_> get that bread gamers
[2:36:44] <flyingavocad0s> @funkystreams They do but the areas are usually way behind
[2:36:46] <Tomkins2244> I'm on my third playthrough now, doing it on Supernova but I'm a pacifist and only my companions are allowed to fight
[2:36:47] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Wait, CHARON? Like the Fallout companion?
[2:37:01] <%deviljhojho_> also a real life mythology reference
[2:37:11] <%TIME_PUNCHER> True
[2:37:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nah like the deff ferryman
[2:37:29] <jhonxiolonn> yay
[2:37:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> N A K A M A
[2:37:33] <+corn__dawg> so are there more possible party members than there are available party members slots?
[2:37:35] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I can't see her name and not think NOKIA
[2:37:45] <%deviljhojho_> got nakamaÂ¿sd
[2:37:49] <Zenduviq> Heh, Pat has 69 adreno.
[2:37:51] <%deviljhojho_> oh no my keyboard
[2:37:52] <dekkitout> You gonna press 'F'?
[2:37:54] <Tomkins2244> Sadly no. You can get outside help during certain fights, but not more party members.
[2:37:58] <%joylent_blue> f
[2:37:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[2:38:01] <%joylent_blue> little f

[2:38:12] <%marsanta> f
[2:38:13] <%TIME_PUNCHER> F in Peace
[2:38:15] <%MightyMaxT> F
[2:38:16] <%Ranryu692> she lays them out in the CHARON order, but doesn't leave room for her own grave
[2:38:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> shoulda left a spot for herself next to Opal.
[2:38:22] <%deviljhojho_> Time to die, nyoka
[2:38:24] <jhonxiolonn> i think they made normal easy and hard normal because this is mostly a dialog game.
[2:38:35] <%TIME_PUNCHER> FIP
[2:38:40] <+Meow0369> Meow0369 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:38:43] <%deviljhojho_> i went with edgewater and that loading screen said "SAVIOR OF THE FRONTIER"
[2:38:51] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I was actually pretty stressed out when I got like 2 party members and thought there would be like 20 I had to choose from to form a crew
[2:38:55] <Tomkins2244> It's a shame there's no true barehanded method that I found to test if story mode is beatable without weapons.
[2:38:55] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Finally, Nyoka can die and it won't matter
[2:38:57] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 Remember everyone, this is the last week for festival of the lost, so get your strange coins, and buy Eva's boosters. Most importantly, go talk to Eris. The raisins call out to you.
[2:38:58] <+corn__dawg> well, I'll leave here before I spoil myself too hard
[2:39:00] <%Meow0369> why not
[2:39:33] <%deviljhojho_> time to die, nyoka
[2:39:33] <Tomkins2244> Oooh, looks like Pat is gonna finish the game this stream from the looks of things.
[2:39:33] <%TIME_PUNCHER> I have no idea what that means, Kirby
[2:39:44] <braaklyn> Whoâ€™s Scylla?
[2:39:46] <Tomkins2244> It's a Destiny 1 (2?) event going on, I assume
[2:39:46] <jhonxiolonn> @AngriestPat can you change the difficulty real quick? at this rate the last part of the game will be a coplete joke
[2:39:53] <%joylent_blue> highly doubt he'll beat it tonight
[2:39:56] <%deviljhojho_> parvati, max and sam are the most useful party members I think
[2:40:01] <dekkitout> Kirby's on about Destiny's current event Festival of the Cost
[2:40:01] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Broken legs for old times' sake.
[2:40:11] <Tomkins2244> There's only 2 more areas I think? Maybe 3
[2:40:12] <%deviljhojho_> parvati and max have good perks and sam just shreds
[2:40:15] <dekkitout> Yes, I know I typed 'cost'
[2:40:23] <%Animorphimagi> 3 hours left
[2:40:31] <%Ranryu692> not if you play only 1 night
[2:40:34] <Tomkins2244> 6 hour stream! 6 hour stream!
[2:40:41] <fearhurst> @angriestpat hard is almost completely unnoticeable difference
[2:40:42] <%torontototoro> This quest ends so anticlimactically ugh.
[2:40:48] <%GarbageQueenEllie> look at his stink face
[2:40:49] <%deviljhojho_> nah i definitely think we are gonna need another stream
[2:40:50] <braaklyn> Donâ€™t you hate it when you jump from ten feet, and your legs temporarily break
[2:40:56] <%trashcansan> 12 hour stream
[2:40:57] <%deviljhojho_> apatSmug
[2:41:01] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Kill Clyde
[2:41:01] <RushUnplugged> eh Ellie's free revive is good on higher difficulties

[2:41:38] <blackesteagle> Who is worse Pat? Aloth or Felix? LUL
[2:41:39] <%deviljhojho_> we have to kill nyoka
[2:41:45] <%deviljhojho_> it has to be done
[2:41:51] <ãƒŸãƒ¥ã‚¦ãƒ¬4242> it's more profitable to run both the crime and the law enforcement. that way you get the greatest return on insurance.
[2:41:57] <jhonxiolonn> oh, there
[2:41:58] <%TIME_PUNCHER> They see me Clyding, the hating

[2:44:12] <%Animorphimagi> Damn
[2:44:14] <%honeyman18> So I hit the CLEAR actress playing a character in Desth Stranding. I swear this lady just monologues longer than any real character so far.
[2:44:20] <%ShichiNoBushi> The good thing about Moon Gang other than the hilarious hats is that it's easy to recognize your friends.
[2:44:42] <%Typhaeon> Watson'd
[2:44:42] <%joylent_blue> moon friends
[2:44:44] <Guardiansaiyan> JUST got here...is the whole world burning yet? CurseLit CurseLit
[2:44:53] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I'm surprised the Moon Mask is even aloud in this game, considering game press
[2:44:56] <blackesteagle> mystery solved
[2:45:03] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat pat it isnt teleportation its moon magic duhhh
[2:45:11] <Tomkins2244> The Board would like to remind you that accusations of soliciting piracy, despite the factual nature of such is grounds for immediate demerits. Refusing to accept these demerits will result in additional demerits, so please arrive for them.

[2:46:16] <%TIME_PUNCHER> NO GODS NO KINGS ONLY FELIX

[2:46:24] <%deviljhojho_> RISE UP, BOX HAULERS
[2:46:27] <%xcompleasedad> Water covalently bonds with itself, the same things it does to "wet" items. Water, therefore, is wet

[2:47:27] <CursedNobleman> @xcompleasedad water polar bonds with itself, covalent bonds are electron sharing, not +/- attraction

[2:48:01] <%GarbageNirvana> apatGib
[2:48:02] <Tomkins2244> Pat makes a fair point. Nobody should look up to Pat. He hoards healing items, talks about trying to teleport the poop out of himself and distrusts homeless people for their possible syringes.

[2:49:00] <CursedNobleman> well, pats lungs are working LUL
[2:49:01] <+Cavumentum> If Ellie kills a quest it deserves to die
[2:49:05] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Does Ellie only kill people if you haven't completed their personal quests?

[2:49:11] <%DonatelloJose> apatWink
[2:49:16] <%deviljhojho_> took me a while to notice the grundbreaker tile on the floor
[2:49:18] <%Typhaeon> Sanjar is apparently a big fan of mace torches
[2:49:21] <wrightlight94> Elmo so cute rooAww
[2:49:23] <%marsanta> The roof! :P
[2:49:30] <PkSilent01> WIt that why it happen, when I finished the game it said that she died but I was playing on Normal
[2:49:41] <Tomkins2244> I haven't had the game glitch like this before. At worst, a mantisaur got stuck in the ground once. But I'm also running the game on a 960, not to brag. Kappa Kappa
[2:49:42] <%GarbageQueenEllie> apatBlep
[2:49:44] <FunkyStreams> he's a very special guy.
[2:49:44] <%deviljhojho_> elmo is a mighty creature
[2:49:46] <leothewhitelion> Emlo's paw
[2:49:49] <%pilgrimsayswhat> I never encountered this Ellie serial killer bug
[2:49:54] <CursedNobleman> @Typhaeon ... i like the mace torches, with a good diruption enchantment on them, i can fend off undead
[2:49:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> pet the mighty baby boy
[2:50:05] <%Seraphile> i only encountered it on my second playthough
[2:50:09] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Talk to Ellie in the Lab, maybe she'll kill Phineas
[2:50:09] <%deviljhojho_> ellie's sidequest is a doozy
[2:50:10] <RubberFistFight> Even though I have 3 cats, and they're all beautiful, delightful creatures (even the youngest and most rambunctious/destructive one), I'm legit sad I don't get to pat the Elmo. He seems wonderful.
[2:50:14] <%torontototoro> Ellie's sidequest is the WORST. so laughably bad
[2:50:15] <%joylent_blue> SHE'S TRYING TO DO IT AGAIN
[2:50:30] <FunkyStreams> Back in the ancient times, The Mandalorians used to ride giant Elmos into battle.
[2:50:30] <%Typhaeon> @CursedNobleman Those must be coming in the inevitable DLC campaign
[2:50:31] <%xcompleasedad> Need to go to Byzantium?
[2:50:32] <Tomkins2244> It's great! Tsundere ellie.
[2:50:33] <Goldenwolf98> Shes gonna murder someone right now
[2:50:34] <%deviljhojho_> it was probably meant as a parody of companion quests
[2:50:35] <%TIME_PUNCHER> What is happening to her FACE
[2:50:37] <LandOfTheWay> did pat get the unique armor in clyde's base?
[2:50:37] <%Typhaeon> Nice of Sanjar to have prepared us
[2:50:37] <fearhurst> water is just cohesive to itself, but since being wet is having water adhere to you, I say water is wet
[2:50:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> that's an odd lighting bug
[2:50:44] <BlindGato> Yandere Ellie

[2:51:13] <jhonxiolonn> you can't talk with people when they're going up a latter

[2:52:02] <%Typhaeon> I don't like this QuietShy fanfic

[2:52:16] <%Big_Dream> elmo is fat
[2:52:17] <%joylent_blue> emily_luxnoire when he'd talk to her someone's companion quest would fail
[2:52:25] <fearhurst> ellie's dialogue was causing people to lose quests or die
[2:52:31] <Tomkins2244> We need some Pat x Phineas fanfictions next
[2:52:32] <%DonatelloJose> Elmo is big fluffy
[2:52:34] <Fujiwara_92> ADA really is just Shy huh
[2:52:35] <emily_luxnoire> that is really weird lol
[2:52:45] <+Punchasaur> Fine ass?
[2:52:45] <RubberFistFight> @Big_Dream he's a little chonky, but most of that is his fur. Apparently he was UNDERweight for a while there iirc.
[2:52:48] <%GarbageQueenEllie> But scarcity means you can make more MONEY
[2:52:52] <%joylent_blue> we deduced that Ellie is actually a serial killer
[2:52:56] <%deviljhojho_> exciting tomatoPog
[2:52:58] <FunkyStreams> Elmo packs on a lot of mass to keep warm during the winter months. as is custom with his kind.
[2:53:05] <%torontototoro> Byzantium is the least exciting area of the game :(
[2:53:07] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Why are we even taking orders from this chucklehead
[2:53:12] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Emlo, he look apatPorgmo
[2:53:15] <dekkitout> Especially if the thing that's scarce is illegal
[2:53:15] <RubberFistFight> @FunkyStreams it is the way of his people, after all.
[2:53:29] <%deviljhojho_> @PlainSimpleTailor he give big gun
[2:53:35] <fearhurst> *How much you steal doesn't actually matter*
[2:53:35] <Tomkins2244> I dunno if I'd say it's the least exciting. The writing is still really good when interacting with a certain robot bartender.
[2:53:52] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I love how Elmo poses for the camera. He such a good boi
[2:53:52] <CursedNobleman> @torontototoro i like the main quest there :(
[2:53:53] <RubberFistFight> looking at Elmo makes me smile. I'm a 36 year old man, smiling at a Canadian's cat on the internet. The fuck am I doing with my life. LUL
[2:54:04] <MageSonic> redboiConcern

[2:54:07] <Thorn14> I admit I kind of wish it wasn't so black and white, like...the board is just blatantly shitty
[2:54:10] <%Typhaeon> Beats doing big drugs Rubber
[2:54:11] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @deviljhojho_ Good Reason. Gun Good
[2:54:16] <Tomkins2244> Awww, Elmo's doing the Pokemon Brock thing
[2:54:22] <%joylent_blue> sounds like you've made only correct decision to me RubberFistFight
[2:54:25] <RubberFistFight> @Typhaeon how about doing the big drugs and then looking at Elmo?
[2:54:27] <Fro5tburn> less impossible sounds good to me danThink
[2:54:30] <%torontototoro> the environment itself is so barren and lame. hardly worth all the teasing. plus the Board stuff is meh. low point of the game imo
[2:54:35] <dekkitout> Subterfuge? Wack
[2:54:40] <%Typhaeon> No, Elmo is the only drug you need
[2:54:42] <%Scarnehu> @angriestpat how's destroying capitalism going
[2:54:54] <Tomkins2244> Did you do the "retirement" side quest? Kappa
[2:54:58] <Thorn14> I was in line at popeyes drive through and there was a cat near the entrnace of the drivethrough eating some run over food.
[2:54:59] <RubberFistFight> oh my god his goofy slightly-crosseyed stare is the best
[2:55:02] <Tomkins2244> That spices Byzantiem up a bit
[2:55:06] <%torontototoro> the retirement quest is fantastic, rare exception!
[2:55:08] <+coastghost64> :3
[2:55:09] <Thorn14> I had to nudge my car slowly to get him to move
[2:55:14] <FunkyStreams> Elmo is the big sleepy rn.

[2:56:02] <%deviljhojho_> tit for tat makes you invincible with a melee build, so good...
[2:56:07] <FunkyStreams> @AngriestPat Can we just get a close up of the BABY
[2:56:15] <%Animorphimagi> Put on Max and Ellie
[2:56:15] <%nekodelic> hacking is not nearly as useful as lockpicking in this game
[2:56:18] <FunkyStreams> oh nvm
[2:56:20] <RubberFistFight> So did Elmo sit in his own shit because he's a doofus? Or did he have a hyperplasia moment and kinda fall on it?
[2:56:27] <FunkyStreams> He's turned his back on us.
[2:56:36] <Tomkins2244> One of the few things I disliked about this game was inconsistency in skill checks. It went from 15 lockpicking required. 30. 60. 100. Same with hacking. 10, 50, 100. It felt like there was very few in betweens.
[2:56:38] <%deviljhojho_> yeah lockpicking is amazing
[2:56:42] <braaklyn> Show us dat ass
[2:56:43] <RubberFistFight> hypoplasia*

[2:56:59] <$LocDogX86X> not really
[2:57:01] <%Typhaeon> It doesn't haver to
[2:57:03] <Tomkins2244> Existing ruins your Board rep.
[2:57:03] <Fujiwara_92> Its fine
[2:57:04] <%joylent_blue> don't think so
[2:57:05] <%Big_Dream> @AngriestPat only if you do it wrong
[2:57:05] <%Animorphimagi> No
[2:57:06] <%deviljhojho_> you can do an easy way
[2:57:06] <LandOfTheWay> it can if you do it badly
[2:57:07] <moosemonkey397> no, it does not
[2:57:10] <%honeyman18> Just no murder and you're golden
[2:57:12] <ãƒŸãƒ¥ã‚¦ãƒ¬4242> ice â‘¨ from outer space.
[2:57:16] <%deviljhojho_> thats the LAST quest
[2:57:17] <+VideoGameTim_> that one is later pat
[2:57:19] <%billyup00> you'll be fine
[2:57:20] <%derap41> Its not this one
[2:57:21] <%torontototoro> do all the crummy sidequests on Byzantium first. shouldn't take long
[2:57:21] <jhonxiolonn> be a pacifist
[2:57:23] <blackesteagle> why don't they get one drink each? why do they have to share?
[2:57:23] <Thorn14> cirPrise
[2:57:24] <RushUnplugged> it's not a one quest that does it, but if they get too low, it's rough
[2:57:25] <%WackyGear> why not do the companion quest?
[2:57:28] <LandOfTheWay> oh, no, that's another one
[2:57:28] <+Cavumentum> If you fuck it up it will, but you big talky so you'll be fine, you always are
[2:57:29] <RubberFistFight> @ãƒŸãƒ¥ã‚¦ãƒ¬4242 that Ice 9 is some dangerous shit, man
[2:57:30] <moosemonkey397> that would be the one after this one
[2:57:35] <%honeyman18> PACIFISM IS THE ANSWER
[2:57:36] <mayorrev> So is Phineas evil now?
[2:57:37] <%deviljhojho_> you have good rep with the board right now
[2:57:39] <Tomkins2244> This game is completable without any bad Board points, I think. Just requires using your stealth foreskin suit.
[2:57:39] <%deviljhojho_> dont worry
[2:57:41] <FunkyStreams> Not a good thing. There's good peeps there.
[2:57:42] <%Typhaeon> Why is ADA's face so round
[2:57:44] <Thorn14> @AngriestPat Pat I was pretty antagonistic to the board and I was never attacked on sight at Byzantium
[2:57:44] <Fujiwara_92> Its the last and you can circunvent it
[2:57:46] <mayorrev> Phineas seems evil
[2:57:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I went far enough with sublight for them to show me they were completely out of their minds
[2:57:50] <%deviljhojho_> sounds good
[2:58:04] <%derap41> Byzantium is freakin tiny tho
[2:58:06] <RushUnplugged> phineas is the most not evil person
[2:58:07] <%joylent_blue> i never want to see the term foreskin suit every again
[2:58:10] <RubberFistFight> @Typhaeon because it's mostly outline, they didn't sketch/shade anything like cheekbones or shadows.
[2:58:16] <%joylent_blue> ever
[2:58:19] <pi_in_the_sci> If you want to follow sub-light to the end, Byzantium will hate you. You can do better though
[2:58:22] <blackesteagle> my fav quest
[2:58:25] <%Typhaeon> I mean even with outline it looks like a man's face shape
[2:58:30] <%RyanTheRecluse> !uptime
[2:58:30] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 58m.
[2:58:34] <Tomkins2244> Make sure your speech and hacking are up to snuff before going in here and committing. Specifically your lie for best results.
[2:58:46] <+Punchasaur> The one that makes them attack you involves the main quest in Byzantium
[2:58:47] <%Scarnehu> apatBig apatBig apatDab
[2:58:47] <Monkeyweed21> ROBITS
[2:58:49] <%joylent_blue> yo

[2:58:59] <Dualities> Steal the clone.
[2:59:00] <fearhurst> just some humanoids
[2:59:06] <MageSonic> just a man in a tube nothing strange here
[2:59:11] <Tomkins2244> Oh did he find the alie-- huuuumans
[2:59:18] <jamesofn> why did you get closer before shooting it
[2:59:21] <%joylent_blue> yes stand as close to the mine as possible before setting it off
[2:59:24] <%derap41> They're coming to probe urethra
[2:59:25] <%deviljhojho_> Inspiriation is great on this game. those bonus skill points really add up
[2:59:28] <+OmegaOcelotOk> smart, get closer to the explosions
[2:59:29] <%RyanTheRecluse> Oh youâ€™re on this mission
[2:59:32] <fearhurst> you can just walk past those though
[2:59:33] <%joylent_blue> pat you're gonna die
[2:59:34] <mayorrev> ow my ears
[2:59:38] <%Seraphile> SAVE
[2:59:44] <%Typhaeon> You are in combat with yourself
[2:59:46] <jamesofn> youre concussed
[2:59:46] <%deviljhojho_> wait for dizzyness
[2:59:49] <%Typhaeon> thanks to Mr. Mine
[2:59:50] <fearhurst> @angriestpat pat this terminal will kill you
[2:59:51] <%deviljhojho_> to pass out
[2:59:51] <Tomkins2244> Now we find out if Pat disables the robots or goes for murder. Also, letting a mine hit you counts as combat.
[2:59:54] <%derap41> Its the conncusion
[2:59:55] <dekkitout> Compass says otherwise
[2:59:58] <fearhurst> @angriestpat make a full save
[3:00:02] <%Seraphile> savee
[3:00:02] <%Typhaeon> which is probably Mr. Mime's next poke-evolution or something
[3:00:14] <%deviljhojho_> almost
[3:00:15] <Tomkins2244> Specifically, when you're "dizzy" camera from a mine is on, that's combat.
[3:00:35] <%Scarnehu> maybe stand back a little further before shooting the explosives
[3:00:51] <dekkitout> @Typhaeon That thing is nightmare fuel and mind you I am speaking with Mr. Mime in mind...
[3:00:52] <redrins> high life gas?
[3:00:56] <Tomkins2244> Uh-oh...Pat repaired the toilet. Looks like we're going Anti-Board run.

[3:01:49] <braaklyn> How do you trigger this?
[3:01:50] <Tomkins2244> Nooo he doesn't have enough lie!

[3:02:00] <+Punchasaur> UNSAFE LANDING DOCKS HAVE CONSEQUENCES
[3:02:00] <%RyanTheRecluse> If you talk good thereâ€™ll be no problem

[3:02:43] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Shut the fuck up Ellie
[3:02:44] <mayorrev> just give people money 4Head
[3:02:46] <Cerabret100> that is an absurdly low amount of bribe money considering how easy it is to come by
[3:02:57] <Tomkins2244> If you use lie for that, you scream about self-detonating the ship and she dramatically goes "Noooo!...Wait are we still alive? Oh screw this. Let's get outta here!"

[3:06:14] <+Cavumentum> BIG Concussed
[3:06:19] <Tomkins2244> You wouldn't be in combat if you stopped using your face to disarm the mines, Patrick

[3:08:41] <Tomkins2244> Corpseman Facebook Satellites
[3:08:43] <$LocDogX86X> Computer with the blank keycard you picked up
[3:08:45] <fearhurst> I got one from pickpocketing people here
[3:08:51] <jamesofn> i thought you couldnt get it until much later
[3:08:55] <FunkyStreams> the bathroom IS the kitchen.
[3:08:59] <Monkeyweed21> Use the terminal you passed by
[3:09:04] <+BigCoffee> Pat stop being a Zoomer
[3:09:04] <%nekodelic> you passed through it a few times
[3:09:05] <%Big_Dream> yeah
[3:09:06] <FunkyStreams> It;s all about recycling when you live in space.
[3:09:09] <Tomkins2244> There's two keycards I think, in this area. Then some more later on in the game since you can use it twice.
[3:09:47] <Monkeyweed21> IN HERE CUMBO
[3:09:54] <%joylent_blue> its- yeah

[3:10:58] <%joylent_blue> SeemsGood
[3:11:08] <%lazysaiyajin> lazysaiyajin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! 
[3:11:16] <%nekodelic> finally LUL
[3:11:17] <jhonxiolonn> i don't get why pat hasn't kept hats or armor that have skills, to just level them a bit when required
[3:11:18] <Guardiansaiyan> @lazysaiyajin nice
[3:11:38] <Guardiansaiyan> @jhonxiolonn that takes WORK...and we don't do that here...
[3:11:38] <+Punchasaur> Pat watch out, a mine
[3:11:46] <fearhurst> the perk that doubles the stat effects of armor is really useful
[3:11:50] <Tomkins2244> Does he at least use the absurd amount of stat boosting food/booze items?
[3:12:04] <dekkitout> He's right, we do not do work 'round 'ere
[3:12:11] <fearhurst> I had a jacket that gave me 10 lock pick so my perk gave me 20
[3:12:16] <%Scarnehu> no, he refuses
[3:12:26] <Tomkins2244> But...There's so much. Like thousands of them.
[3:12:35] <%joylent_blue> those are temporary buffs, they are anathema
[3:12:41] <%Tredecian> pat watch out
[3:12:50] <RubberFistFight> Pat, a mine.
[3:12:54] <+Punchasaur> Told ya
[3:12:56] <%RyanTheRecluse> Just shoot them
[3:12:58] <dekkitout> Pat, you stepped on a mine- and you also sold Ratslayer
[3:12:58] <%Scarnehu> pat hates temporary buffs and won't touch them
[3:13:01] <jhonxiolonn> i miss seeing pat use the inhalator. I think he had like 129 at one point
[3:13:05] <Tomkins2244> Which is why it never hurts to carry around +5 all stat items by the dozens, like a delicious refreshing Purpleberry Crunch
[3:13:06] <+Punchasaur> Look out again
[3:13:09] <%joylent_blue> pat the LOCKER
[3:13:18] <Guardiansaiyan> The LOCKER
[3:13:18] <+OmegaOcelotOk> Pat, why? just shoot it you have so many bullets

[3:13:30] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[3:13:31] <rosemon5001> i wonder if he would use a chem if it boosted hacking or something

[3:13:56] <%alphonseisbest> YOU HAVE A PROBLEM pat
[3:13:57] <Tomkins2244> But...Does...Does he just decide he can't do skills that require a slight buff? Sees a locked door 5 points above his skill and the mind goblins refuse?
[3:14:00] <TheBeautifulProtagonist> At least you don't heal off a concussion effect via sleeping.
[3:14:01] <%trashcansan> capitalism = no doors
[3:14:06] <FunkyStreams> Havarti, use human shield!
[3:14:15] <%trashcansan> you need to buy the bathroom door
[3:14:24] <jhonxiolonn> pat is not stealing everything, this is bad
[3:14:28] <DocMadfox> @Tomkins2244 Pat doesn't like temporary buffs.
[3:14:30] <%Kirby_Sauce> missed a thing
[3:14:31] <dekkitout> Those mind goblins are quantumly fixed

[3:14:50] <Tomkins2244> I...I knew the mind goblins were bad because of Dishonored and roguelites, but this is some next level
[3:14:52] <%joylent_blue> they have little plaques you can read
[3:14:53] <%Big_Dream> wrong
[3:14:54] <DocMadfox> Wot
[3:14:59] <dekkitout> They're probably gonna get juiced up with molten adamantium...
[3:14:59] <DocMadfox> Where did that even come from?
[3:15:01] <%Animorphimagi> Nope
[3:15:03] <Monkeyweed21> they gave lore

[3:15:07] <%derap41> Stop pulling ass out of your shit
[3:15:07] <%Seraphile> nice guess but wrong
[3:15:12] <%RyanTheRecluse> @angriestpat dialogue on tubes
[3:15:18] <dekkitout> It's the only rational reason to be in a red pod
[3:15:22] <%Bluwizard21> @angriestpat nope but close
[3:15:26] <%joylent_blue> i mean it is fishy
[3:15:27] <DocMadfox> It's not even close
[3:15:27] <%RyanTheRecluse> Text I mean
[3:15:41] <%Scarnehu> @tomkins2244 dude, the fallout play through was the same
[3:15:47] <DocMadfox> Phineas isn't even connected to this quest
[3:15:47] <Tomkins2244> Pat they're dirt cheap with up to 69% discounts and thousands of them available you absolute crazy person you better not just hoard them
[3:16:01] <$LocDogX86X> A L I E N S

[3:16:10] <Guardiansaiyan> @Tomkins2244 what blasphemy are you spouting?
[3:16:12] <+BigCoffee> They're honest ethical scientists
[3:16:12] <Lord_of_all_Edges> Well they weren't going to stop experimenting on me, so I might as well experiment on them back.
[3:16:12] <Goldenwolf98> wouldnt you if you could become an imortal toilet Pat?
[3:16:18] <DocMadfox> Morality keeping them from using forced test subjects like they said in the last fucking place?
[3:16:22] <%Seraphile> they didn't want to use "volunteers" from tartarus @AngriestPat
[3:16:24] <%honeyman18> Pat, they had stupid reasons!
[3:16:27] <%Animorphimagi> Desperdesperate for SOME reason.
[3:16:28] <%joylent_blue> Tomkins2244 he actively denied the existence of magazines in his NV playthrough
[3:16:30] <%Alazull> because they didnt want to use prisoners or workers
[3:16:54] <%joylent_blue> +20 to medicine? nah its temporary fuck that

[3:17:04] <Lord_of_all_Edges> OwO What's this? Genetic manipulation?
[3:17:04] <%Bluwizard21> @angriestpat that is the question. why did they do this? the theme you've been seeing the whole game

[3:17:26] <%Flambage> @AngriestPat They were making Furries
[3:17:29] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> But I don't WANT to cure cancer. I want to turn people into DINOSAURS.
[3:17:30] <Tomkins2244> I can get behind denying magazines because they're rare-ish without the perk to make them, but the ability to buy all of the good ones for like...10 credits in this game (which I never bought anything in this game, I hoarded every bit and invested it all in one game) is astonishing
[3:17:31] <fearhurst> no end date
[3:17:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you'll see
[3:17:38] <Goldenwolf98> Imortal Furries
[3:17:40] <%PlainSimpleTailor> NUKE THEM

[3:17:57] <%joylent_blue> itchy tasty
[3:18:07] <%trashcansan> ed....ward...
[3:18:09] <Dakuu75> sounds like the plot for Spiderman Unlimted cartoon. the world jsut becomes furry
[3:18:11] <FunkyStreams> This is what'll happen if we let them get their way, srsly.
[3:18:12] <%Scarnehu> it's plague, but in space Kentucky

[3:18:29] <FunkyStreams> Kentucky is about as cold as space rn.
[3:18:30] <Tomkins2244> @FunkyStreams All cats have barbed penises that are designed to destroy the vagina on the way out, and ruin her for the other cats.
[3:18:30] <Goergorion> Furries?! zimeSnek zimeLex
[3:18:39] <+Imn0tacop> so just discovered that the loading screens in the game are determined by your player choices
[3:18:45] <dukenux> or like that Batman Beyond ep where gene splicing was all the rage.
[3:18:55] <+Imn0tacop> doing a kill-all playthrough, and I'm getting loading screens about it
[3:18:57] <+Punchasaur> WHAT DONT YOU LIKE LIPSTICK
[3:19:00] <dekkitout> The youths did love their gene splicing
[3:19:10] <%trashcansan> batman beyond was great because terry killed like 10 people
[3:19:14] <FunkyStreams> I wouldn;t be surprised if plague looked like Jack Nickelson at the end of the Shinning
[3:19:22] <%Seraphile> @Imn0tacop oh wow thats cool
[3:19:28] <dekkitout> Based McGuinnes is based
[3:19:38] <Tomkins2244> I bet Pat is loving this lore because it gives him hope about becoming a toilet Kappa
[3:19:39] <%joylent_blue> Imn0tacop my next playthrough is definitely gonna be kill everything
[3:19:42] <%honeyman18> Well I wonder if the corporations were trying to do good? probably not

[3:20:42] <%Puhff> Something happened on Earth
[3:20:43] <+theotherkristian> codename:cumin4datass

[3:21:32] <%joylent_blue> scrape harder
[3:21:33] <HyperBomb21> I finished this game just before Death Stranding came out. honestly, The Outer Worlds is a 6/10 for me
[3:21:34] <dukenux> speaking if knits
[3:21:38] <dukenux> *knota
[3:21:40] <+Punchasaur> AntedilUwUvian

[3:22:03] <ZE_Count> 8/10
[3:22:06] <+Cavumentum> <oink softly>
[3:22:10] <dukenux> fucking large fingers
[3:22:14] <Tomkins2244> Don't have to save before this quest, but turning it in I highly suggest saving.
[3:22:20] <Tomkins2244> Also, get ready for big genre changes. Big.
[3:22:24] <HyperBomb21> The RPG mechanics in this game are too shallow and its too easy to become good at everything
[3:22:25] <%trashcansan> nice music
[3:22:26] <dekkitout> @FirearmsInstructor Space 9/11 never happened, I guess...
[3:22:30] <Monkeyweed21> just talk to her
[3:22:33] <%derap41> Is he figuring something out
[3:22:33] <asurite_warrior> That feel when you know but don't want to be a spoiler asshole
[3:22:36] <%Animorphimagi> Oink
[3:22:38] <+OmegaOcelotOk> its gonna be really cool pat
[3:22:49] <%Puhff> The relay quest you do for GroundB mentions there hasn't been a message from Earth in 3 years...
[3:22:49] <%valkuma> sometimes the uncomfortable path is the right 9ne
[3:22:55] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> I love that you made both of them wear the spacey's helmet.
[3:22:58] <FirearmsInstructor> @dekkitout apparently. I guess they didn't have a Bush family. *shrugs*
[3:23:01] <dukenux> is that a main story mission
[3:23:06] <%honeyman18> When you learn, You will LOVE and HATE it.
[3:23:12] <dekkitout> I'm sure there's one on the board
[3:23:18] <%Seraphile> oh yeah its right up pats alley
[3:23:36] <dukenux> the soylent green!
[3:23:38] <%RyanTheRecluse> And the people at Edgewater were getting plague because of malnutrition
[3:23:48] <Tomkins2244> Here it comesssssssss
[3:23:48] <%Seraphile> don't spoil people
[3:23:51] <asurite_warrior> Shut it
[3:23:54] <+theotherkristian> My favourite score I give to video games in my head. The Outer Worlds is an awesome 8/10. To me, its core narrative isn't compelling, which made me mostly prefer the side stuff.
[3:24:00] <%derap41> Spratwurst are people!!

[3:24:59] <RubberFistFight> @theotherkristian plenty of RPGs have the real story happen in the sidequests, it's nothing new, and in fact it's really great when done well.

[3:54:28] <%Zamorouskiwhich> I honestly think that people have finished this by now, and want Pat to do the big thing
[3:54:31] <%trashcansan> It's because everyone has played outer worlds so they're trying to backseat now

[3:56:10] <Zenduviq> They know they have no reason to fear.
[3:56:13] <RubberFistFight> @FunkyStreams yup. And that's why people who shave their cats in the summer are doing a bad thing. Insulation works both ways - that double-layer coat helps them stay cool in summer as well as warm in winter.
