[0:08:00] <%brisk_dacat> If you asked gief to roll over would he just fall asleep.
[0:08:14] <spike_j_wolfwood> get those filthy kid hands away from Geif!
[0:08:16] <%dankjerri> they just full force hit pets then stroke very gently
[0:08:25] <+robosqueeb> he smilin :D
[0:08:29] <%Monkeyweed21> he could also eat Paige
[0:08:35] <%dekkitout> "Aww they think they're food" must be what dogs think in contrast to us saying "they think they're people"
[0:08:35] <%MugenSandan> little kids tend to either start light as a feather, barely touching, or slapping at full force there is no in-between
[0:08:37] <%dankjerri> thats a major issue
[0:08:38] <%ComradeConquistador> Gief getting a taste for flesh.
[0:08:42] <$Ziegsy> he gets attention from the INSIDE
[0:08:46] <+robosqueeb> full stomach > attention

[0:10:35] <%TheotherKristian> Miranda has ass, that's kinda it...?
[0:10:37] <%Theycallmenerf> Zaeed!
[0:10:39] <%StaceMcGate> Miranda at least has a story? Unlike Kaiden and Ashely in ME1 who just frontload their backstory
[0:10:39] <nyacoo> Mirandass
[0:10:41] <Minorou> @Ipsenscastle true, true
[0:10:41] <sendart> Jacob is soldier man and thats it

[0:11:03] <peachy996> Don't do Jack until you know you can nullify her shit argument with Miranda once it pops up immediately afterwards
[0:11:05] <+robosqueeb> his daddy issues are stopping him from being loyal?
[0:11:08] <%dankjerri> big ol space racism
[0:11:10] <Broken_Sonex> Miranda is fine honestly. Also she’s a PAWG
[0:11:11] <%Ipsenscastle> We should have recruited his shitty dad instead
[0:11:19] <stantheman_97> i feel like I'm the only person who likes miranda outside her sex appeal
[0:11:20] <%dekkitout> Is Jake supposed to be characterized as "I'm not touchy feely"?
[0:11:22] <trianglehat> heavy risk.. but the prize
[0:11:27] <%Monkeyweed21> @AthenaAegis Miranda doesn't compare aliens to animals
[0:11:28] <Minorou> everyone in ME2 has daddy issues
[0:11:34] <knight_verse> In ME3 Miranda's mission continues.
[0:11:44] <%MugenSandan> Jacob has nothing to have a mission about
[0:11:44] <peachy996> Nah I like Miranda as a character. Her sex appeal is meaningless to me
[0:11:44] <%dankjerri> dad fuck you fucked my gf thats not cool
[0:11:47] <causewaybob> Miranda is PAWGERS lol
[0:11:51] <%Theycallmenerf> Hang out with Zaeed!
[0:11:53] <satans_finest_millennial> I seem to recall Mirandas actor was in Chuck at the time and thats when everyone went "sexy time scene?"

[0:12:47] <$Ziegsy> @ballerswagbro9k what did we do?
[0:12:50] <%ComradeConquistador> Yes.
[0:12:57] <%dankjerri> they're heat sinks
[0:13:08] <%ComradeConquistador> This is good.
[0:13:16] <+mythicwyatt> talis loyalty mission is what jacobs would be if he had any sort of agency
[0:13:20] <%dekkitout> The information being communicated so far is reasonable, continue
[0:13:26] <%maskofmichael> I still want infinite ammo though
[0:13:27] <peachy996> The ability to reload wasn't crucial in my opinion
[0:13:33] <%dankjerri> I feel a but coming on
[0:13:33] <trianglehat> running out of "not ammo" seems like a downside
[0:13:39] <%weissguard> *but*?
[0:13:40] <+Ches_Neckbeard> ME3 Lancer is the best gun
[0:13:44] <%Monkeyweed21> but then how do you run out of "ammo"
[0:13:53] <%dankjerri> he said the thing
[0:13:57] <%shurtal> huge butt
[0:13:58] <satans_finest_millennial> Mirandas in fact
[0:13:59] <%ape_hawk> bigger than mirandas?
[0:13:59] <%dankjerri> MIRANDA CLASS BUT
[0:14:00] <%MidnightBurst12> big butt
[0:14:00] <peachy996> There are guns in ME3/MEA that function like the old me guns
[0:14:00] <iosephe> Miranda sized butt
[0:14:02] <%afronooch> safety concern
[0:14:03] <Minorou> you know how fond we are of big buts
[0:14:03] <jillpilled> Haha butt
[0:14:08] <Saltmeisterr> big booty
[0:14:11] <%dekkitout> So you """run out of ammo"""
[0:14:18] <%valriot> If heat sinks were like Gears active reload, it wouild be fine
[0:14:22] <hairtoday> the old-style heatsinks are probbaly gone for space
[0:14:22] <%Ipsenscastle> they talk about how dumb this is in ME3
[0:14:25] <+robosqueeb> enjoy that instant 3rd degree burn
[0:14:27] <%Cykron> It's a safety feature
[0:14:34] <%Ynkubus_> health and safety?
[0:14:34] <Profmcstevie> uh.....safety mechanism, can't fire without a sink
[0:14:34] <stantheman_97> yeah they should've mixed those two together
[0:14:35] <Broken_Sonex> Getting rid of unlimited ammo will always be stupid no matter how you slice it
[0:14:35] <nyacoo> It's a safety precaution
[0:14:36] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt You also can't just wait for it to cool down
[0:14:37] <%bread_assassin> They explain this away in ME3.
[0:14:37] <%42nfl19> @patstaresat probably a safety feature,
[0:14:38] <Profmcstevie> gottem
[0:14:42] <%dankjerri> But maybe it doesnt have room for both cooling systems
[0:14:42] <%Ranryu692> they had to take the old stuff out to fit the heat sink tech in. Shep explains it in ME3
[0:14:46] <NitronStreams> As someone that just built a computer the idea of replacing the heatsink all the time is fucking dumb
[0:14:46] <%valriot> THATS HOW GUNS WORK THOUGH
[0:14:48] <%maskofmichael> Fuck Safety
[0:14:52] <ThatGuyThere03> Pat
[0:14:52] <%SkyfireHero> that safety feature sucks
[0:14:57] <+WaywardSera> but liability tho
[0:14:58] <knight_verse> Wait... Guns run out of ammo?
[0:14:59] <notsoy> shout out 40k plasma guns
[0:14:59] <%dekkitout> There are guns with that issue
[0:14:59] <%dankjerri> oh its not a 1/100 chance pat
[0:15:00] <%walternatorz> 1/100 chance over 100 bullets you're gonna blow up.
[0:15:02] <stote45> what about the guns feelings?
[0:15:02] <nyacoo> But think of the children
[0:15:03] <trianglehat> guns are dangerous, we can't have that in a war
[0:15:03] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt pat, the old heating system doesn't exist anymore
[0:15:04] <+robosqueeb> thats not how...nevermind doesnt matter
[0:15:04] <%dankjerri> more like 70 percent
[0:15:05] <peachy996> You mean like some sort of invasion?
[0:15:05] <+ThomasOfTroy> The original idea of having a few poppable heatsinks to instantly cool an overheated gun was infitinely better
[0:15:05] <%valriot> Thats what all future guns are like
[0:15:07] <%Ranryu692> it's a 100/100 the gun will explode if you shoot it
[0:15:08] <+Cab0san> I always just headcanon’d it as weapons makers making the guns stronger/generate more heat than the old cooling could handle, since the clips were disposable
[0:15:09] <%SirGO0SE> sup gang gang
[0:15:12] <%MugenSandan> Honestly the ammo thing seems like you're choosing what you want Mass Effect to be. ME1 you want something more like Star Trek. ME2 you want something more like near future sci-fi
[0:15:12] <aiutare47> They aren’t designed for passive heat bleed anymore. The real issue is that every gun in mass effect was fixed in two years when the US Army still has m16s and ALICE.
[0:15:15] <%mikesapartment> space insurance
[0:15:17] <+ThomasOfTroy> Soldiers don't get to claim liability
[0:15:21] <OtakuSnake1> OtakuSnake1 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:15:21] <%MidnightBurst12> is it tho?
[0:15:22] <hairtoday> not with illium as a place
[0:15:22] <peachy996> Like some sort of planetary invasion by reaper forces?
[0:15:23] <Dunmarkh> @knight_verse not in mass effect
[0:15:31] <Ekaelis> All future sci fi guns are somehow worse than what we already have
[0:15:37] <%Monkeyweed21> also you should just wait for a few seconds and your heat sink cools down
[0:15:42] <%dankjerri> @patstaresat I can tell you this if you cant ensure 100% functionality, the product is non-still able.
[0:15:43] <knight_verse> @dunmarkh /s
[0:15:45] <%ElkRiverDog> Ironic considering Canada developed rifles that did just that during ww1
[0:15:45] <hairtoday> older style guns should still be around
[0:15:47] <sendart> also weird that literally everyone switched over
[0:15:49] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt it's like taking the radiator out of your car, then trying to try it. It's like taking your fans/watercooling out of your PC and still expecting it to run afterward
[0:16:00] <%Torus1025> @patstaresat How many loyalty missions were you planning on getting through tonight?
[0:16:00] <%ssjklyco> It's ammo less, not ammo NONE
[0:16:03] <%rekinom> As we all know, rats can't swim. What you might not know is rats have recentlyt been seen using human made materials to make little rafts to overcome this weakness. For more information, search "Rat Inflation"
[0:16:09] <Minorou> Assassins and other crime-dudes wouldn't use the heat sinks since that leaves evidence
[0:16:12] <BigFingerRo> HEY 'S DA PASTA STREAM
[0:16:19] <%ComradeConquistador> Revenge
[0:16:19] <+EmptyMug> You can edit the game files to have a hybrid ammo/heat sink system which seems neat
[0:16:21] <%skeleklng> Apparently ME2 was gonna have infinite ammo and you could use clips to circumvent waiting, but apparently play testers thought it was too complicated

[0:16:32] <%MugenSandan> @patstaresat Actually with enough heat sinks shouldn't you also effectively have infinite ammo as the heat sinks cool down?

[0:16:37] <%Cykron> LUL
[0:16:43] <satans_finest_millennial> if the guns were re-fitted to accept heat sinks they likely would not function in their former configuration

[0:16:45] <%ssjklyco> Worth it

[0:17:06] <Hanzmolman> Ban that guy
[0:17:08] <%dankjerri> INCORRECT
[0:17:15] <%dekkitout> I think I understand nuclear physics more than kingdom hearts
[0:17:15] <Gorshum> I mean I like the sound of this so far.
[0:17:16] <%Pappajimbo> It would make sense to have collant pods to fast cool a inbuilt heatsink
[0:17:18] <%dankjerri> THROW THE WHOLE CHATTER AWAY
[0:17:20] <T_Sasquatch> wut
[0:17:28] <Profmcstevie> complex but singular
[0:17:29] <peachy996> The Paragon outcome for Zaeed's loyalty mission isn't worth the trouble.
[0:17:30] <%StaceMcGate> and they also had to sacrifice half their expected games
[0:17:35] <+WaywardSera> Xenosaga's gonzo bullshit
[0:17:37] <+ScrapKingKeita> Xenosaga is 1 game spread across 3 discs that came out at different years
[0:17:48] <%MugenSandan> At least it's not supposed to be Canon when Kos-Mos punches Ryu in the dick
[0:17:51] <$Ziegsy> I played episode 2. enjoyed it. couldnt tell you what the FUCK i played
[0:17:51] <%dankjerri> xenosager
[0:17:55] <+RelikaNox> I....loved Xenosaga >_>
[0:17:55] <%Noir_Valdr> disagree
[0:17:59] <%Nyanlathotep> @ScrapKingKeita You forgot the part where they only made half the games they planned.
[0:18:00] <%Noir_Valdr> they are
[0:18:02] <satans_finest_millennial> @dekkitout cause Nuclear phsics follow rules and logic
[0:18:08] <notsoy> but robot tiddy tho
[0:18:09] <%Noir_Valdr> they good games
[0:18:09] <Profmcstevie> unless they're rereleased, fuuuck it
[0:18:10] <%StaceMcGate> Xenogears lost its budget, and Xenosaga was supposed to be 6 games but the bad reception had it be only 3
[0:18:12] <%Monkeyweed21> buh muh KOS-MOS tho
[0:18:25] <+ScrapKingKeita> @ScrapKingKeita this is true
[0:18:27] <BigFingerRo> @dekkitout ARGUMENTS and LOGIV
[0:18:28] <%Noir_Valdr> Xenosaga good'

[0:19:40] <%Vextalyst> cheer500 Hey pat i remember me and friends were in the middle of DA: Origins when it came out discussing the themes of sexism and racism to which one of us was like "there's hardly any in the game" after like an hour of arguing it turns out he didn't notice it because he was the only one of us to play as a male human noble. Shit's the realest it's ever been and only made me like the game more.

[0:36:41] <%SaphronBlackbourne> no thanks
[0:36:42] <Profmcstevie> .....live action maybe, CG absolutely
[0:36:44] <peachy996> It would hav to be heavily cut for time and content
[0:36:47] <notsoy> mass effect is way too long for a movie, make it a series
[0:36:51] <+farrellcityking> Please take away his toy. It killed the podcast
[0:36:55] <%saadi90> Just watch Star Trek
[0:36:56] <notsoy> same with yakuza, make it a netflix series
[0:36:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah Bioware was right to make the call that Mass Effect needs a show.
[0:37:00] <aiutare47> I’m not sure what it’d cover
[0:37:02] <jackelzxaa> aw
[0:37:02] <%Monkeyweed21> Just focus on Mordin's days in the STG
[0:37:03] <+HellfireComms> Mass Effect would be decent these days
[0:37:03] <%aWanderingKaivo> Garrus Shepard buddy cop show do it
[0:37:03] <jillpilled> Animated on Netflix honestly would make sense as a show
[0:37:04] <stantheman_97> for the better tbh
[0:37:05] <%Cykron> It's not that simple
[0:37:05] <+D00msDayDan> i don't want live action mass effect because it would never get the budget it needs
[0:37:05] <Tracazoid> Make a movie about Shepard talkign to the Elcor and Volus diplomats

[0:37:09] <smuggleruncle> too much ass

[0:37:14] <%Cykron> GET HIS VOICE ACTOR
[0:37:15] <jackelzxaa> doing live action krogan and turians would be insane
[0:37:15] <smuggleruncle> or not enough ass
[0:37:15] <%heartlesshealer> make up and props cost A LOT PAIGE

[0:37:20] <%dd44dostivei> ninja turtles movie suits
[0:37:22] <%Ipsenscastle> doing an ME show right would be insanely expensive
[0:37:23] <Profmcstevie> That's why CG show would be balling
[0:37:23] <notsoy> Yakuza and Black Lagoon would be great picks for Netflix series
[0:37:23] <+WaywardSera> It's not Garrus without Brandon Keener
[0:37:24] <Joem1k> zangief is going nuts.
[0:37:24] <%TheotherKristian> Anime?
[0:37:25] <jackelzxaa> asari and humans are the easy part

[0:37:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It'd be better do a Mass Effect show without Shepard and Pals honestly.
[0:37:42] <%ainzhelm> @patstaresat Development hell for sure. Like the halo movies
[0:37:43] <%Retinolgaming> Just have his voice actor do it?

[0:37:50] <%polothegreatest> 3d animation? or 2d?
[0:37:53] <+Romuken> who'd play Mordin, or Legion? @PatStaresAt
[0:37:54] <nyacoo> just drag and drop the cg models in the scene
[0:37:55] <%dankjerri> get Zoey saldana to play Liara
[0:37:55] <Chaos_Aether> Well there was a mass effect movie
[0:37:56] <%ape_hawk> isnt that what they did with Dinosaurs?
[0:37:57] <%Axellogic> gotta punch up that actor
[0:37:57] <%Monkeyweed21> just do CG
[0:37:58] <DracaenaLeaf> LOL
[0:38:00] <%Draco_Renegade> If they do an animated show they should just get the original voice actors to reprise their roles
[0:38:02] <%Dementedpenguin> Just rewatch Captain Kirk fight Gorn again.
[0:38:04] <%Cykron> His VA is an actor
[0:38:04] <Ravioli_Ronin> If they made Mando on a relatively small budget, they could do ME

[0:38:07] <%williamrooster> bandon keener has acted
[0:38:07] <+HellfireComms> Steve Buschemi should play Mordin
[0:38:10] <aiutare47> @patstaresat his VA was an actual actor before voice work.

[0:38:17] <peachy996> Live Action adaptations are basically "It takes place in modern day cuz fuck you Sets are hard"
[0:38:20] <%dankjerri> get Scott Steiner to play the Krogan
[0:38:21] <jackelzxaa> liara is the one who shows up in the most stuff because she's the only person who can't die in me1 or 2

[0:56:46] <$PhantomMiG> What happens when you pass out due to the blood rushes to your array of dicks.
[0:56:47] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt In ME1 did you run into the bug where Shepard wouldn't stop running in one direction in hub areas
[0:56:48] <peachy996> If you believe the internet Asari have dicks and Turian dicks are blue
[0:56:49] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt have fun with that when Windows 11 comes out (which is right around the corner)
[0:56:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> No its Paige fault

[0:56:51] <%MidnightBurst12> no signal is best signal
[0:56:52] <anAngryHamster> Did I miss anything good?
[0:56:52] <%ironohki> @maskofmichael After the lap dance scene in ME2 where the human, selarian and turian all realize the Asari look like sexy them by psychic powers, I have generally assumed the whole species just looks like Shuma Goraths.

[1:00:24] <peachy996> It was the russian snowstorm one
[1:00:25] <%Garthunox> BREAKDOWN!
[1:00:26] <%Dakuu75> uuuhhhh... you ok bro?
[1:00:31] <s1rcuit> hey guys what did I miss?
[1:00:34] <RaidenRising> ptsd
[1:00:38] <%THATGUY_789> I hate this Sherlock Holmes shit
[1:00:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> "Dance crazy" is very relatable.
[1:00:42] <LordOfThePoultry> FeelsBadMan
[1:00:43] <Broken_Sonex> "It was this thing call the.....Harlem Shake...."
[1:00:45] <Zeif00> I always forget he has pupils
[1:00:46] <kenny_biff> Kappa
[1:00:47] <James_Quivers> It's a SPEEN dance
[1:00:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's something a kid would call it.
[1:00:54] <theshillman> The numbers, Mason
[1:00:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> His flashbacks are like an Indian soap opera
[1:00:58] <Jaysky> No pack of cigs?
[1:00:59] <%Cykron> Thane remembers the Naruto Swing
[1:01:02] <%MugenSandan> Okay Thane would kinda be better without the wacky camera and noises, just the dialog
[1:01:12] <%Taisuru> Sad fish
[1:01:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> His business was murder!
[1:01:26] <Flickerember> Thane doing the crazy dance then go and murder someone
[1:01:28] <+KermitOnAScooter> He hasn't done Garrus' loyalty mission yet, right?
[1:01:30] <James_Quivers> CATS IN THE CRADLE AND THE SILVER SPOON, LITTLE LIZARD BOY AND THE ASSASSIN ON THE MOON
[1:01:37] <ScreamLord> Drell memory seems more like PTSD flashbacks without the trauma
[1:01:44] <spike_j_wolfwood> this dude is going to snap and kill everyone on the ship.
[1:01:44] <%MugenSandan> @ballerswagbro9k as someone who has grown up with Indian soaps oh man you CANNOT BEGIN TO IMAGINE
[1:01:45] <Flickerember> I want Thane to dance like Pat in canon
[1:01:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @MugenSandan There was a mod for that with OG ME2. Hopefully it's one that gets recreated.
[1:01:51] <Archer336> I always used to get a laugh out of his flashbacks when I sort've just didn't say something immediately when he stopped talking, leaving this awkward silence.
[1:01:59] <%illtima> Zangief
[1:02:08] <Profmcstevie> He fucks across the galaxy
[1:02:15] <%Cykron> Christian father hates son's drug use
[1:02:23] <peachy996> hippie dippie gooble gobble
[1:02:24] <%Ipsenscastle> Pat's soul has been replaced by goblin
[1:02:39] <peachy996> but those lips though
[1:02:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Thane would be better if you could make his son call you "Mom" in 3.
[1:02:54] <PanicSwytch> So ur saying Gief's mouth acts on its own. Disconnected from the mind and body
[1:02:54] <%twistedj3ster> Why was this guy my favorite when I played so long ago...
[1:03:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Because he's great!
[1:03:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> JOHN WICK JR
[1:03:22] <$QueequegTheater> Because he's really cool
[1:03:23] <viewtifulr> Hey i missed the first hour for a pet vet visit - how much was done?
[1:03:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Thane is the Reluctant Badass.
[1:03:32] <ToneBacas> imagine having perfect recall
[1:03:34] <kenny_biff> Kappa
[1:03:36] <%logoth_> Ive missed Thanes weird freak outs
[1:03:39] <Flickerember> Pat blinds his enemies with the dome
[1:03:39] <+CookieCutter007> the reality tv close ups
[1:03:45] <%Wallabri> this is... so much more awkward than i remember....
[1:03:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @viewtifulr just started
[1:03:47] <peachy996> The musical stings ruin these moments
[1:03:48] <%twistedj3ster> I remember him being...better tho
[1:03:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Imagine having perfect recall AND BEING AN ASSASSIN
[1:03:53] <AthenaAegis> Eyes of a Chihuahua WutFace
[1:03:55] <theshillman> telenovella
[1:04:05] <TheDeceasedJester> aaaaaa i always feel sorry for thane :(
[1:04:05] <viewtifulr> @BallerSwagBro9k hot dang thats RAD
[1:04:09] <%MichaelDood> Shaka when the walls fell...
[1:04:12] <$QueequegTheater> He doesn't
[1:04:13] <%crazyspartan214> "flashback"
[1:04:18] <willyfreshness> Always rains? WHY THE FUCK DO YOU LIVE THERE
[1:04:19] <%42nfl19> are these weird episodes a race thing, his disease thing, or just him? @patstaresat
[1:04:22] <heartlesshealer> he really doesn't
[1:04:28] <%kortin> he doesnt, Thane's people all just dissociate in the middle of their conversations
[1:04:31] <Profmcstevie> Race thing
[1:04:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @42nfl19 Race thing
[1:04:35] <%Ipsenscastle> I like Thane. For a more minor squadmate he's interesting, and gets some cool moments
[1:04:37] <$lotharrio> I'd like it if Shep could just always be confused by Thane instead of getting an answer about his memory freakouts.
[1:04:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Drell all do that.
[1:04:39] <$QueequegTheater> @willyfreshness they killed their desert planet
[1:04:39] <Broken_Sonex> @willyfreshness Shut up
[1:04:41] <jillpilled> Imagine how many innocuous words would trigger flashbacks
[1:04:43] <AthenaAegis> @MichaelDood TIMBA! His arms wide! Kappa
[1:04:43] <willyfreshness> Kelly does it later
[1:04:44] <spike_j_wolfwood> "You're creeping me out. Get off my ship" ~Shepherd
[1:04:44] <+ParryLurr> rain is nice. just stay inside
[1:04:45] <%Taisuru> @willyfreshness I mean it always rains in london and people live there Kappa
[1:04:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> They don't all say it aloud though.
[1:04:46] <peachy996> Feron doesn't do this the brief moment you talk with him
[1:04:46] <+doc_ock_rokc> PTSD with Perfect recall
[1:04:46] <%saiyanblitz> This Iguana man flashback dialogue scares me
[1:04:49] <%MugenSandan> you know what does Tim Rogers think of Thane since Tim has the same condition
[1:04:52] <James_Quivers> "Thane, what do you want for breakfast?" "EGGS, FALLING FROM THE CLOACA... THE CHICKEN CLUCKS IN DESPAIR AS THE FARMER REACHES DOWN..."
[1:04:56] <peachy996> I think Kolyat does this in Me3
[1:04:58] <Slim_Lipid> Just like Sheldon from bibimbap theorem PogChamp
[1:05:01] <%Cykron> Ditactic memory
[1:05:06] <ToneBacas> PTSD with perfect recall would fucking suck even more
[1:05:06] <%Garthunox> Does the planet Kahje run out of the courtroom screaming "YOU ARE INTERFERING WITH MY BUSINESS!"
[1:05:08] <$QueequegTheater> @peachy996 Feron isn't dying of a terminal disease
[1:05:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Drell all have perfect recall, not all of them say what they're remembering as it's happening.
[1:05:29] <peachy996> Yeah but it's just disappointing You only talk to 3 drell in ME2+ME3 combined
[1:05:34] <%Monkeyweed21> TUCHUNKERS
[1:05:38] <DSD24> Hades Nexus is a good name
[1:05:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> They're all dying out tho.
[1:05:47] <$PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Drell Dwell on the things they have done. They really only changed 1 letter

[1:09:20] <%sunsetdisc0> @patstaresat what are you using to save time scanning like that
[1:09:20] <%Faustgesicht> I like how it doesn't even have a name. Just "krogan DMZ"
[1:09:21] <ChungusQuest> Probe the means of production!
[1:09:34] <%Cykron> All the planets are the moon or Uranus
[1:09:35] <%Ipsenscastle> How is it than in ME people really don't know what Quarians look like? The extranet would be flooded with Quarian porn

[1:10:44] <%JohnAtDawn> THEY CALL IT A DMZ
[1:10:46] <%sunsetdisc0> there's a difference between cheating and quality of life
[1:10:51] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I just cheat in the resources in my later playthroughs lol
[1:10:53] <$QueequegTheater> Wait, why?
[1:10:54] <Zeif00> Tuchanka Deez Nutz
[1:10:54] <%skeleklng> sidequests in this game are fucking awful
[1:10:55] <%Monkeyweed21> its pronounced 2 Chonkers
[1:10:57] <+Cactuskris> why
[1:11:00] <%Taisuru> Why's that?
[1:11:01] <peachy996> Oh it gets worse if you do it again in 3
[1:11:02] <%Mattais88> You can renegade wrex to your side
[1:11:03] <James_Quivers> @PatStaresAt Probably because the Krogan fucked the planets in this sytem with their meteor drops
[1:11:03] <%BinaryFireball> is this the krogan place?
[1:11:04] <VentWilsn> how bad?
[1:11:07] <+Cactuskris> renegade still saves wrex
[1:11:07] <stantheman_97> wreav is a krogan stereotype man flesh
[1:11:08] <%williamrooster> wrex's shity brother
[1:11:08] <ioci2112> you can save wrex if you went renegade
[1:11:09] <$lotharrio> Wrex's dipshit brother is in charge.
[1:11:10] <Flickerember> @PatStaresAt You better d the thing that makes wrex go yeyeyeyeyeyeyeye
[1:11:12] <%Faustgesicht> Grunt and Mordin
[1:11:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I mean you can go renegade and still have Wrex alive.
[1:11:14] <%charp35> You mean you don't like wrex's brother
[1:11:15] <peachy996> You can utterly FUCK it up in ME3
[1:11:16] <Vikingincognito> You can still talk Wrex down as a renegade PAt
[1:11:17] <$hattrick61> cause rex is dead and wreave is a fuck
[1:11:18] <%dekkitout> Team Dextro
[1:11:19] <intestinal_bleeding> stinky cerberus are not allowed
[1:11:19] <%aWanderingKaivo> but grunt tho
[1:11:20] <Dunmarkh> ok?
[1:11:20] <willsin4fun> the 2 chonkers are wrex & grunt eh
[1:11:21] <%Cykron> Why not the War Criminal salamander?
[1:11:24] <%Monkeyweed21> NO TAKE GRUNT
[1:11:28] <+Cactuskris> yes
[1:11:30] <%Taisuru> No grunt?
[1:11:30] <lord_sykos> Don't you have to take Grunt?
[1:11:31] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Pure renegade saves Wrex
[1:11:33] <peachy996> I do too.
[1:11:36] <%bread_assassin> Bring Tali along on Mordin's mission for a funny encounter.
[1:11:38] <%sunsetdisc0> basically if you killed wrex
[1:11:39] <Vikingincognito> There are renegae dialouges that talk him down
[1:11:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This isn't the mission yet.
[1:11:41] <$SGrim> When Pat was younger, he enjoyed multiple probes per encounter, but now that he's older he loves the one-and-done.
[1:11:43] <+Cactuskris> I literally took the red option
[1:11:44] <%Monkeyweed21> TAKE GRUNT TO MEET WREX
[1:11:46] <+KermitOnAScooter> More like pure Shitegade
[1:11:48] <peachy996> Yeah.
[1:11:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pure renegade literally talks him down Pat.
[1:11:49] <James_Quivers> Pure renegade in ME3 is EVEN WORSE for Tuchanka, oh boy
[1:11:54] <Jaysky> The worst part about playing ME2 only is that you can't get Wrex
[1:11:57] <viewtifulr> oh if you killed wrex, yeahi can see the problem with that
[1:12:00] <ioci2112> full asshole, pure renegade talks wrex down super easy
[1:12:01] <%Ascethetic> oh man, my power finally came back on!
[1:12:01] <Jaysky> Reset?
[1:12:03] <%Garthunox> Pure renegade can still save him, you can only not save him if you're pretty neutral and dont gain either
[1:12:04] <%kujofire990> you can bring Grunt later, still get he dialog
[1:12:07] <peachy996> Wait till ME3 my guy, we'll tell you how it can get worse
[1:12:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The real worst thing for Tuchanka is for saving Wrex until 3.
[1:12:14] <$QueequegTheater> Pat that was a complicated way of saying Wrex is cool
[1:12:14] <%Draco_Renegade> I wish Wrex had his own DLC like Liara
[1:12:18] <%Cykron> LUL LUL
[1:12:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And then not curing the Genophage.
[1:12:23] <%Taisuru> Mordin LUL
[1:12:27] <+TheBitingIrish> Ohhh nooooo
[1:12:30] <Profmcstevie> Maximum friction
[1:12:30] <%Cykron> THIS is the pairing
[1:12:32] <wolverinewaswrong> nah mordin doesn't matter outside his quest
[1:12:33] <$lotharrio> Oh boy... I sure hope things work out okay with team genocide.
[1:12:33] <Jaysky> EY
[1:12:37] <%Monkeyweed21> CHARR
[1:12:38] <%rekinom> Hey mordin, whatcha doin?
[1:12:38] <satans_finest_millennial> YAAA CALLED IT so glad i smoked for this
[1:12:39] <Jaysky> YOU watch it
[1:12:39] <$hattrick61> ye garrus gets like 1 line and tali gets nada
[1:12:39] <wolverinewaswrong> on tuchabka I nean
[1:12:41] <%Rumbutt> Love that thresher maws came from Tuchanka too
[1:12:45] <%Taisuru> Mordin and Wrex should kiss
[1:12:46] <Vikingincognito> I think it would be cool if the little gaurd by the door refuses to let Turian or Salraian crewmates in
[1:12:48] <peachy996> @Too_Much_Nukie I mean the bomb in Victus sidequest
[1:12:52] <mak0t0yukii> google chrome WutFace
[1:12:52] <DSD24> Mordin matters all the time
[1:12:53] <%Cykron> Mordin is in the wroooong neighborhood
[1:12:58] <Profmcstevie> Unleash the guide
[1:12:58] <peachy996> You can let that bomb go off
[1:13:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[1:13:00] <James_Quivers> Twochunky
[1:13:01] <+KermitOnAScooter> What if we kissed on Tuchanka? jk... Unless...
[1:13:01] <+TheBitingIrish> FOR TUCHANKA!
[1:13:02] <Flickerember> Tuchanka needs more dakka
[1:13:03] <%Monkeyweed21> 2 Chonkers
[1:13:09] <Hellarussian> time to min/max
[1:13:14] <$lotharrio> Toochunky.
[1:13:19] <%Mattais88> Poor little Salarian boy
[1:13:23] <%misteroutdated> TwoChanclas
[1:13:33] <RetributionP> Pat should change his name to pat rambles at
[1:13:38] <$hattrick61> 2chunka 4 u
[1:13:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @peachy996 Yeah and it kills Eve if she's still alive. Along with half the population. But if you do that AND don't cure the genophage you get to gun Wrex down in public on the citadel.
[1:13:52] <ScreamLord> Two Chungas
[1:13:53] <%Cykron> Pat Shambles Toward
[1:13:54] <+tinytinykittycat> lol
[1:13:56] <peachy996> Yeah
[1:13:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And sacrifice the entire Krogan race for your war.
[1:14:03] <%sunsetdisc0> @patstaresat you're not able to but the varren food and feed the varren anymore it sucks
[1:14:15] <peachy996> You can just destroy the Krogan completely in ME3
[1:14:16] <%Garthunox> @sunsetdisc0 wrong
[1:14:17] <intestinal_bleeding> CHARR
[1:14:17] <wolverinewaswrong> that's not Lalah though?
[1:14:23] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[1:14:24] <peachy996> Or save them
[1:14:25] <Hellarussian> the smog builds character
[1:14:25] <$QueequegTheater> @sunsetdisc0 NOOOO
[1:14:26] <$lotharrio> Is that the poet?
[1:14:26] <James_Quivers> He's already a dad, lol
[1:14:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @sunsetdisc0 Yes you are you have to do the gun minigame first.
[1:14:27] <stantheman_97> charr is a good boy
[1:14:29] <wolverinewaswrong> ANURO
[1:14:30] <%Ranryu692> thats their daughter

[1:14:31] <%condemned_15> she vibrates
[1:14:33] <%logoth_> Charr the Red Rocket
[1:14:33] <%shadowsofpain> yup
[1:14:33] <%sunsetdisc0> I love charr
[1:14:34] <wolverinewaswrong> AMURO
[1:14:35] <ScreamLord> *Sweats in ME3*
[1:14:40] <peachy996> Probably the few positives about ME3 is the Krogan situation
[1:14:42] <%Garthunox> @QueequegTheater he's wrong dont worry
[1:14:45] <%Ranryu692> nevermind thats a different thing lol
[1:14:47] <%maskofmichael> How do you think Krogans kiss?
[1:14:49] <%StaceMcGate> uhhh
[1:14:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Guys Charr DOES make it work.
[1:14:50] <%williamrooster> I forget do you get unique dialog if you meet wrex with tali and garrus
[1:14:52] <$QueequegTheater> @Garthunox good
[1:14:55] <Dunmarkh> quattro bajeena
[1:14:56] <%StaceMcGate> this isn't looking good
[1:15:01] <RetributionP> IS THAT JECTH FROM FF10
[1:15:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HES SO COOL
[1:15:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @williamrooster Nah Garrus gets one line and that's it..
[1:15:08] <%Cykron> Tuchanka is lit though
[1:15:14] <intestinal_bleeding> *dismissive hand wave*
[1:15:15] <%TheSpoonyBard27> Charr aznable
[1:15:16] <thelonechris> I feel like he gets beaten up a lot
[1:15:17] <%sunsetdisc0> never been happier to be wrong
[1:15:17] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I broke them up
[1:15:17] <ChungusQuest> But the Thresher Maws are so nice this time of year!
[1:15:18] <Blank9> scenic tuchanka
[1:15:18] <%Cykron> Perfect place to raise Asari children
[1:15:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> wow
[1:15:24] <$QueequegTheater> They don't recruit vorcha, they enslave vorcha
[1:15:24] <James_Quivers> Vorcha are more pets than recruits
[1:15:27] <Alzero83> Tuchanka backwards is Trashbin @PatStaresAt
[1:15:27] <Jaysky> Nah they don't recruit Vorcha, Vorcha are dogs
[1:15:33] <$lotharrio> I like that Tuchanka is basically a Fallout game.
[1:15:36] <%aWanderingKaivo> not quite the overlord
[1:15:38] <$QueequegTheater> GRUNT HORNY
[1:15:41] <VentWilsn> bro she couldnt handle anymore poetry
[1:15:44] <%Cykron> Guide Grunt through puberty
[1:15:44] <James_Quivers> I CAN SMELL THE RUT
[1:15:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Those two are also in ME3. I'm sure chat will remind you when you get there.
[1:15:47] <%Taisuru> GRUNT WANNA FUK
[1:15:48] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt they don't recruit the Vorcha. The Vorcha just follow them for food.
[1:15:49] <SaltyAzteca> DAMNIT, HOW MUCH DID I MISS?
[1:15:51] <$QueequegTheater> HORNY FOR MURDER
[1:15:53] <peachy996> Pay no mind to the Salarian
[1:15:53] <%Cykron> GRUNT NEEDS A FUCK
[1:15:54] <$lotharrio> Grunt needs to learn how to masturbate.
[1:16:01] <zanzibarian_hamster> Not a lot
[1:16:05] <ScreamLord> Grunt needs coochie and blow
[1:16:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I can smell Grunt's puberty from here!
[1:16:16] <jillpilled> teach him to murder fuck
[1:16:17] <wolverinewaswrong> only a war crime if its illegal
[1:16:19] <%BinaryFireball> that guy there... totally not responsible....for... things
[1:16:19] <Jaysky> Yeah those turians
[1:16:20] <SaltyAzteca> Okay good, thanks @zanzibarian_hamster
[1:16:22] <zanzibarian_hamster> "rutting" is a fancy word for "needs to nut bad"
[1:16:24] <ioci2112> @lotharrio I mean the krogan did nuke themselves before the salarians uplifted them because they needed someone who was good at killing to kill the rachni
[1:16:25] <Flickerember> Grunt believes these are... sexual urges
[1:16:31] <%misteroutdated> It’s fine…
[1:16:32] <%goose_attack_almanac> So Vorcha have fucked up regeneration right since their cells are so adaptable... What happens if they get eaten by a thresher maw whle
[1:16:32] <Profmcstevie> haha indubitably suck this genophage OSFrog
[1:16:35] <%Monkeyweed21> reminder that Grunt is the Krogan equivalent of that super buff kid from Kung Fu Hustle
[1:16:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> damn bro
[1:16:45] <+Cactuskris> negativ Shepard. I'm crucial to the Future of species. don't falsefy my records
[1:16:48] <Hellarussian> unlucky
[1:16:52] <SaltyAzteca> Cuz hindsight wasnt 2020 in Tuchanka
[1:16:53] <karovus> are those just the doors from kotor
[1:16:58] <Blank9> if you think this planet's bad, take a look at the 3 turian planets the krogans smashed asteroids into
[1:16:59] <peachy996> I feel like Krogans waffle on whether they hate the Turians more or the Salarians
[1:17:04] <ScreamLord> Krogan Fallout would be an awesome game
[1:17:07] <%Rumbutt> eaten by predator was the #1 cause of death until the invention of firearms, after which it was death by gunshot
[1:17:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Tuchanka also used to be a jungle planet.
[1:17:09] <%williamrooster> their cold war went hot
[1:17:14] <Ravioli_Ronin> Mandolorian lizards
[1:17:15] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt I know the Rut is like some weird puberty but how old is Grunt? Did he get accelerated aged in tank or was he "born" as soon as the tank opened?
[1:17:18] <satans_finest_millennial> @goose_attack_almanac tin foil hot thought
[1:17:19] <%castlerock42> Oh, this guy...
[1:17:23] <%sunsetdisc0> varren are cool
[1:17:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @42nfl19 He's a teenager.
[1:17:41] <ioci2112> that's the thing about the krogan, they might have evolved naturally to balance their population, either biologically or culturally, but the salarians saw a weapon in them, so they uplifted them way before they were ready to join the galactic stage
[1:17:43] <Jaysky> catmechPOG
[1:17:44] <satans_finest_millennial> the vorcha are sentient spores of thresher maw
[1:17:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Also a rut is when a male animal is going through the equivalent of heat.
[1:17:58] <SaltyAzteca> HEY WE GOT NOTHIN TO LOSE
[1:17:58] <ScreamLord> War is all they have left
[1:18:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's not a Krogan thing lol
[1:18:04] <%Cykron> And fighting over fertile krogan mates
[1:18:05] <%Monkeyweed21> the Krogans need to set up a camp for females just to have any chance of breeding
[1:18:06] <$lotharrio> Krogan bros.
[1:18:08] <intestinal_bleeding> well this is cute
[1:18:10] <intestinal_bleeding> and sad
[1:18:14] <stantheman_97> this is sweet in a very dark way
[1:18:16] <%Robot_Nixon_> Hhhehehe hehehe
[1:18:17] <%sunsetdisc0> also the genophage sent them into a downward spiral of nihilism
[1:18:19] <Flickerember> Grunt must nut by shotgunning something
[1:18:21] <peachy996> Andromeda mends this problem with the Krogan that but it's still Andromeda lol
[1:18:29] <Profmcstevie> One less hobby
[1:18:30] <ScreamLord> Pyjak
[1:18:35] <Jaysky> PETPETPET
[1:18:36] <%heartlesshealer> Not enough children to raise any of them peacefully
[1:18:37] <+Urgotfantasy> DOGGY
[1:18:38] <trianglehat> pet
[1:18:38] <%Taisuru> Good varren
[1:18:40] <$QueequegTheater> HE IS A GOOD BOY
[1:18:41] <$lotharrio> What's the liquor they make? Rynthol?
[1:18:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[1:18:41] <hereiam407> That's so Varen
[1:18:45] <SaltyAzteca> Awwwww Varren Gief
[1:18:45] <mak0t0yukii> goox
[1:18:46] <iosephe> You can pet the varren
[1:18:46] <%dekkitout> Careful, don't pull a Kelly
[1:18:46] <Profmcstevie> I'll kick you if I must
[1:18:48] <+LionKagura> What a good boy
[1:18:49] <$QueequegTheater> It's all about tone of voice
[1:18:50] <satans_finest_millennial> good vibes
[1:18:51] <jillpilled> good boy :D
[1:18:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The Krogan in Andromeda haven't gotten Mordin's genophage patch so they're naturally overcoming it.
[1:18:54] <%sunsetdisc0> I LOVE URZ
[1:18:55] <intestinal_bleeding> STINKY
[1:18:56] <willyfreshness> blew my mind this planet looked like this BEFORE genophage
[1:18:57] <LluthyY> varren friend
[1:18:57] <Flickerember> Space doggo still doggo
[1:19:01] <+Cactuskris> if it's a dog it doesn't matter
[1:19:02] <+KermitOnAScooter> This lighting is not kind to Pat Shepard's melty face
[1:19:06] <%zhenthrim213> MONEY
[1:19:06] <%MidnightBurst12> MONEY
[1:19:09] <viewtifulr> money talks
[1:19:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Varren are very smart Pat.

[1:20:05] <intestinal_bleeding> *course
[1:20:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Grunt's tank taught him things with a learning program.
[1:20:07] <Ravioli_Ronin> So basically aliens just drink bleach

[1:20:35] <$lotharrio> I love to shoot vermin-monke
[1:20:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Krogan have redundant nervous systems so if they don't drink extremely hard alcohol it won't kill their brain cells.

[1:31:25] <$lotharrio> "Your murder knife is so fucking sick, dude."
[1:31:27] <$Solid_Stro> Krogan Graduations sound cool
[1:31:29] <%maskofmichael> So the American Goverment?
[1:31:30] <intestinal_bleeding> guy would be a fan of imperium
[1:31:30] <%dekkitout> That's a pretty good measure for success
[1:31:31] <darkmoonknightess23> murder the krogan in his sleep.......
[1:31:34] <%zhenthrim213> @Laecerelius not enough Imagination
[1:31:38] <+vaderxyz1970> Krogans are the best Space Orks
[1:31:48] <zanzibarian_hamster> You'd think life wouldn't be so cheap for them since they live long and fuck bad

[1:32:42] <Ravioli_Ronin> FREE DOG
[1:32:45] <LeotheHuntsman> did wee already talk to wrex?
[1:32:46] <jorniev> it doesn't go on ship
[1:32:46] <%Torus1025> Keep. him away from Kelly
[1:32:52] <%FallenAngelZelos> It’s a sin you cannot bring him on the ship
[1:33:02] <%heartlesshealer> or varren, whatever Mordin said
[1:33:06] <%Cykron> Kelly can smell the Varren on you
[1:33:08] <ChungusQuest> CAIN
[1:33:08] <peachy996> CAIN
[1:33:10] <James_Quivers> @FallenAngelZelos For now :)
[1:33:11] <Laecerelius> Oh yeah, the nuke!
[1:33:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat when you buy them you don't have to research them.
[1:33:13] <peachy996> LOOK AT CAIN
[1:33:13] <%Ipsenscastle> this is the goblinnest playthrough of anything I've ever fucking seen
[1:33:14] <%42nfl19> booo this game, you can't bring space doggo on ship
[1:33:14] <QuestlordJake> C A I N
[1:33:17] <jorniev> Jerry the nuke gun
[1:33:19] <Broken_Sonex> Keep that Varren away from Kelly....
[1:33:20] <ScreamLord> I believe purchased upgrades are automatically applied
[1:33:20] <%toolofparanoia> GET THE CAIN
[1:33:21] <Laecerelius> The only heavy weapon you need!
[1:33:22] <Vikingincognito> Kelly was downgraded SO BAD for Legendary edition
[1:33:24] <+The_monster_hunter> you bought them you dont need to research
[1:33:26] <$Solid_Stro> @cykron She loves it louiseyEyebrows
[1:33:30] <seancbo> I wish the Cain was at all good against the final boss, it makes me sad. You have to make such a perfect shot
[1:33:32] <ChungusQuest> BECOME DUKE
[1:33:34] <%toolofparanoia> FOR TUCHANKA
[1:33:34] <RDknight> build the nuke pat!
[1:33:35] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt they overwrite the previous versions you had equipped
[1:33:36] <%Rumbutt> you just got em
[1:33:36] <Profmcstevie> Purchases need not be researched
[1:33:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt When you buy them you just get them. We told you that last time lol
[1:33:40] <%dekkitout> @Cykron Kelly: *Deeply inhales* "Varren"
[1:33:41] <jorniev> wtf why did it correct to Jerry
[1:33:51] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> The Cain is so unwieldy but its so cool
[1:34:04] <$SGrim> NUKE GUN
[1:34:04] <Laecerelius> YEEEEEEEAH! Nuke time!
[1:34:05] <%logoth_> It looks like a Duke Nukem 3D weapon
[1:34:06] <ioci2112> you have the cain now, you want that shit for grunt's mission
[1:34:06] <ScreamLord> Nuke Gun
[1:34:07] <%MugenSandan> Pat new heavy pistol
[1:34:07] <thelonechris> That's a fucking 90's video game weapon
[1:34:10] <ioci2112> nuke the maw
[1:34:13] <Vi_Stri> that's a fuckin ratchet and clank gun
[1:34:13] <%toolofparanoia> Its a mini nuke launcher
[1:34:14] <Profmcstevie> Imagine having to spend credits AND resources, that'd be gross
[1:34:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The Cain is situational but the highest damaging weapon in the game.
[1:34:17] <%shadowsofpain> new pistol
[1:34:20] <ChungusQuest> Come get some!
[1:34:20] <Flickerember> Cain needs so much ammo for one shot
[1:34:21] <jorniev> LOOKS LIKE DUKENUKEM GUN
[1:34:26] <%Ipsenscastle> fuckin' Duke Nukem over here
[1:34:28] <Vikingincognito> The Cain can only be used 1-2 per mission but it instakills all but 2 enimies in the game
[1:34:30] <Flickerember> But I rarely used heavy weapon anyway so eh
[1:34:30] <%Daxalog> You left Grunt and Mordin behind
[1:34:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> With all heavy ammo upgrades and the right armor, you can fire the cain twice.
[1:34:49] <TioXyco> feylenks?
[1:34:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Which is enough for everything in the game.
[1:34:52] <peachy996> It has a neat laser sight
[1:35:02] <$Solid_Stro> That was a dlc weapon I believe sabert14Sip
[1:35:03] <%dekkitout> Looks like a penta
[1:35:07] <Hellarussian> Thats some Fallout shit
[1:35:08] <%MrBorisMakarov> it's fine
[1:35:09] <%GarbageNirvana> Welcome to trash planet, enjoy our trash
[1:35:10] <%MrBorisMakarov> gun go boom
[1:35:13] <%williamrooster> looks like a rachet and clank gun
[1:35:13] <thelonechris> Blast Corps
[1:35:17] <peachy996> Symbol is glowing too
[1:35:17] <+EvilErickan> cain is best gun
[1:35:18] <%DorianCreed> It's great though
[1:35:21] <TheDeceasedJester> ohhoho the gets shit done heavy weapon *_*
[1:35:21] <%toolofparanoia> its appropriate for the setting you're in currently
[1:35:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The phalanx was a DLC weapon yeah. The cain is not.
[1:35:24] <%Cykron> Is that a Fallout weapon?
[1:35:27] <%MrBorisMakarov> blast corps is a great game
[1:35:27] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt The Phalanx is so beefy that it can't fold up. Until ME3 anyways
[1:35:28] <%condemned_15> Duke Nukem-ass gun
[1:35:29] <JoshManVGH> That looks like a gun from the first Ratchet and Cla k
[1:35:33] <Vikingincognito> The Cain kills every enmy on screen and all but 2 boss level enimies as well
[1:35:39] <Jaysky> Why'd we reset?
[1:35:45] <%RoggleJr> That weapon is going to make them more infertile for sure.
[1:35:53] <intestinal_bleeding> xorn?
[1:35:58] <+FlongBongle> vid??
[1:35:58] <wolverinewaswrong> I went there!
[1:36:08] <%dekkitout> Fair
[1:36:23] <James_Quivers> SHould've just bombed them with regular bombs
[1:36:40] <%Daxalog> Aw
[1:36:47] <%Monkeyweed21> @James_Quivers funny you say that
[1:36:52] <intestinal_bleeding> this guy
[1:36:54] <ScreamLord> Boomer Krogan
[1:36:56] <+The_monster_hunter> Krogan are at the same time the best and worstr of the ME games
[1:36:59] <thelonechris> Damn
[1:37:02] <peachy996> GOT DAMN NEWFANGLED EXTRANET BACK IN MY DAY
[1:37:02] <+FoolsArcade> BOOMER KROGAN
[1:37:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I like to imagine this guy joined Arlakh company and got to see the citadel with Grunt in 3.
[1:37:03] <LluthyY> baby elmo
[1:37:09] <intestinal_bleeding> he's like a backwater neighbor in a run down rural town
[1:37:10] <Profmcstevie> Small town Krogan
[1:37:12] <Flickerember> That krogan sounds a boomer thats like STAY OFF THE INTERNET
[1:37:12] <theshillman> emlo!
[1:37:13] <%hewlettfan96> psaElmo psaElmo psaElmo
[1:37:14] <%dekkitout> "You think we'd make it out the krogan-hood?
[1:37:15] <blue8moon> you guys could at least clean up the floor
[1:37:15] <James_Quivers> That krogan hates twitter and he's based for it
[1:37:16] <theshillman> he baby
[1:37:16] <+RahuHordika> This is some real boomer energy
[1:37:19] <%Torus1025> This guy gets it
[1:37:21] <Broken_Sonex> BOOMER KROGAN VS ZOOMER KROGAN
[1:37:25] <+TheBitingIrish> Pee pee!
[1:37:27] <$QueequegTheater> @Too_Much_Nukie that's canon until proven otherwise
[1:37:29] <zanzibarian_hamster> Good line
[1:37:29] <$Solid_Stro> @dekkitout c4sageLUL
[1:37:41] <Flickerember> For a krogan bet hes a literal boomer
[1:37:42] <+Ghufufin> BOOMER Krogan = KROOMER
[1:37:43] <%goose_attack_almanac> YOU DONT H AVE THE LOBES
[1:37:53] <%hewlettfan96> Get your pyjamas off pat!!
[1:37:53] <%aWanderingKaivo> wow this looks so much better than that fight in Andromeda
[1:37:58] <%condemned_15> hot
[1:37:59] <%aWanderingKaivo> SO much
[1:38:00] <%chiluzza> chiluzza subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months, currently on a 17 month streak! Hello Pat, just curious what the fuck is up with canadians fascination for wendy's? growing up in the states its really LOW on the fast food hierarchy
[1:38:01] <mak0t0yukii> A
[1:38:14] <%AncelDeLambert> there's something upsetting about PAT calling a Krogan small
[1:38:14] <%ape_hawk> yes, you do
[1:38:16] <$lotharrio> What a good ambassador.
[1:38:25] <peachy996> I was just wondering why they made that fight in Andromeda so goofy when ME2 makes it more simple
[1:38:25] <%ape_hawk> its literally what an ambassador
[1:38:26] <%AncelDeLambert> headbutt coming UUUUUUUUUUP
[1:38:29] <%dekkitout> PARAGON
[1:38:31] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL
[1:38:34] <+holsety5> krogan like that\
[1:38:34] <blue8moon> LUL
[1:38:35] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[1:38:39] <blue8moon> well they are krogan
[1:38:40] <%maskofmichael> Imagine if ME had Twitter on the extranet
[1:38:41] <intestinal_bleeding> STEP FORTH TO OPPOSE ME
[1:38:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This isn't the one you can headbutt.
[1:38:43] <%Cykron> Krogan Paragon
[1:38:43] <+Ghufufin> Paragon: Politely threaten to kick his head in
[1:38:45] <$QueequegTheater> Renegade is escalating to violence, pat
[1:38:46] <Slim_Lipid> things get fucky when your food industry enacts standards
[1:38:46] <viewtifulr> flex your muscles for rogan and they will like you
[1:38:46] <Jaysky> Talk with me or be PARA GONE
[1:38:48] <+doc_ock_rokc> to be fair thats VERY KROGAN and they love it
[1:38:48] <olaksi> you have to adjust for krogan
[1:38:53] <$realm_forge> Did he do grunt’s trial yet?
[1:38:55] <ianabstract> carrying the cain around during cutscenes gives shepard such a threatening aura
[1:38:58] <+EvilErickan> paragon for krogans is renegade for humans
[1:38:58] <%dd44dostivei> renegade speaks like ghengis khan
[1:39:00] <%GarbageNirvana> Renegade option's the same thing but also you punch a guy or something
[1:39:00] <+The_monster_hunter> Nakmor are more prevalent in Andromeda
[1:39:01] <peachy996> OH Nakmor Drack
[1:39:02] <%GarbageNirvana> I think
[1:39:04] <intestinal_bleeding> dog
[1:39:04] <%Piemono> Paragon: Cripple a man, Renegade : Murder him
[1:39:04] <Flickerember> @PatStaresAt ME2 has it right when paragon option is still being a badass to the race that love badasses
[1:39:05] <mak0t0yukii> Random dog
[1:39:06] <+FlongBongle> !uptime
[1:39:07] <@Moobot> @FlongBongle I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 39m.
[1:39:11] <RetributionP> paradog dosnt mean good
[1:39:13] <peachy996> This is Drack's clan from Andromeda
[1:39:13] <Vikingincognito> The renegade choice is basically "Just try it, you'll be dead before you can take aim"
[1:39:16] <%Varlinator> Gotta have psaBig space nuts to win Krogan respect
[1:39:19] <$QueequegTheater> Drack is a badass though
[1:39:20] <James_Quivers> With krogan, paragon becomes renegade, and renegade becomes outright random violence
[1:39:21] <%dekkitout> Paragon: "Awe at my magnificence, and weep upon my presence"
[1:39:21] <%shadowsofpain> ME2 paragon took the stick out of their ass
[1:39:30] <Josef_Stryker> Nakmor Drack alone must've had a good amount of influence
[1:39:32] <+RahuHordika> @peachy996 SHIT URITE
[1:39:42] <%Torus1025> Wrex is krogan Nobunaga
[1:39:49] <hereiam407> He has to Wrex shit up
[1:39:49] <seancbo> ok bye
[1:39:55] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt Oh, fuckin Michael Dorn voices a krogan in Grunts loyalty mission, further cementing the klingon parallels
[1:40:05] <seancbo> god I wish it was that easy to end a conversation in real life
[1:40:07] <ZilverZap> I mean, he seems like a typical krogan
[1:40:14] <Dunmarkh> "females"
[1:40:16] <%ape_hawk> THE WISHES OF THE FEEEEMALES
[1:40:16] <peachy996> How young are you
[1:40:17] <$QueequegTheater> He sounds like the Krogan version of a soyface
[1:40:19] <James_Quivers> THE FEMALES STOLE MY VOCAL CORDS, HUMAN

[1:40:37] <+KermitOnAScooter> Are Krogans incels?
[1:40:42] <%Varlinator> Back in the day, I thought this krogan was female
[1:40:43] <tuesti> LUL
[1:40:46] <%Ipsenscastle> This guy sounds like the Cheat's impression of Strongbad
[1:40:48] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt The quintessential Krogan soyface
[1:40:49] <intestinal_bleeding> meme words
[1:40:59] <Vikingincognito> WOOO

[1:44:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Wrex is the fun uncle with a criminal record.
[1:45:04] <SaltyAzteca> Working together! Solving the problem!
[1:45:07] <peachy996> Wrex (and Eve) are so instrumental for a better future for the Krogan race
[1:45:10] <kingjames60> I’ll just pick “hostages” that didn’t matter anyway. Kill them and help me out and I kill the other clans.
[1:45:15] <hereiam407> How are there no Krogan like sea shanties available in these games

[1:45:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Patter songs.
[1:45:50] <hereiam407> My only fear with Krogan songs is that it would be like Vorgunant poetry
[1:45:54] <%Cykron> Join our diverse team OR DIE
[1:45:55] <$lotharrio> His boner is huge and distracting, please fix ihm.

[1:46:36] <Wolfstriker121> lol
[1:46:36] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I like that his plates aren't joined together because he is tiny babby
[1:46:37] <BigFingerRo> Isn't Paige the offspring of a syringe as well?
[1:46:39] <Broken_Sonex> Wrex is like: "Okeer? (lights cigarette) Haven't heard that name in years...."
[1:46:40] <%Torus1025> lol
[1:46:44] <+crimson_echidna> Watching this stream with my nephew and he's like "WHY DOES HE KEEP SAYING I LOVE YOU!"

[1:47:13] <$Solid_Stro> Grunt is a cute baby turtle
[1:47:14] <ezlo_86> his balls are dropping
[1:47:15] <Vikingincognito> I always exppalined it away as grunt being younger and less worn down
[1:47:15] <+akscully> pure krogan increases your polygons
[1:47:16] <$QueequegTheater> @crimson_echidna your nephew needs a proper education
[1:47:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah it's weird that they didn't use Wrex's ME3 model here.
[1:47:17] <Profmcstevie> Bred him with HDR
[1:47:18] <%Faustgesicht> Tuchanka has some of the best dialogue in the game

[1:51:59] <SaltyAzteca> OH I DARE
[1:52:00] <LordOfThePoultry> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[1:52:00] <+The_monster_hunter> that would fuck my neck up for days
[1:52:01] <+MisterAvry> he DARES
[1:52:05] <%goose_attack_almanac> I like that Sheperd hurt his fuckin neck doing that
[1:52:06] <+Mr_Misanthropy> We ride together, we die together. Bad Boys for life!
[1:52:08] <%Deft_Thought> Your skull would collapse
[1:52:08] <James_Quivers> That must've hurt Shepard like a BITCH
[1:52:09] <$lotharrio> "I know plenty about Krogan. Check it, headbutt!"
[1:52:10] <BigFingerRo> FIRST OF ALL HOW DARE YOU
[1:52:10] <seancbo> I actually have no idea what happens in this game if you dont do the interrupts, I've literally never seen it LUL
[1:52:11] <%Varlinator> HOW YOU LIKE THE TASTE OF BALD?
[1:52:13] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> I always like doing that
[1:52:14] <BTR_NOODLE> YEYEYEYE
[1:52:14] <tanarath> MUCH HONOUR
[1:52:15] <+FlongBongle> LUL
[1:52:16] <%Deft_Thought> That'd be like headbutting a steel wall
[1:52:18] <peachy996> Oh hey! You...suck!
[1:52:23] <$QueequegTheater> I love this guy
[1:52:23] <+MisterAvry> This Homer Simpson lookalike fuckin dares
[1:52:25] <VentWilsn> BRO THAT SHOVE
[1:52:25] <hereiam407> Shepard headbutts, and dies
[1:52:26] <+Ghufufin> renegade race go
[1:52:28] <+RoByte2> Run away before another empty barrel breaks your spine Worf!
[1:52:29] <+black_pariah> remember shepard is a amped up cyborg
[1:52:31] <$realm_forge> MY GUB SHOOTS BARRELS YOU BETTER RUN
[1:52:31] <%NateyBeak> he's as a failure of a krogan as worf is a failure of a klingon its perfect
[1:52:33] <TioXyco> it's the principle!
[1:52:33] <intestinal_bleeding> it's the thought that counts
[1:52:34] <Jaysky> "You just slapped me?"
[1:52:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I'm sure it did.
[1:52:38] <$QueequegTheater> It's like spitting on the ground in front of him
[1:52:40] <godzookylives> Shephards brain is bleeding
[1:52:40] <peachy996> Shep looks embarrased and Uvenk looks offended at the gall
[1:52:41] <%twistedj3ster> Shepard demands satisfaction!
[1:52:43] <%AncelDeLambert> well... it'd be weird
[1:52:43] <%dekkitout> Fronthand or backhand?
[1:52:44] <iosephe> bitchslap them
[1:52:45] <%goose_attack_almanac> THE INDIGNITY
[1:52:45] <%DakotaMacDoodle> That probably hurt like hell
[1:52:46] <stantheman_97> shepard now has a concussion
[1:52:47] <$lotharrio> Truly, truly, truly outrageous.
[1:52:48] <%RubberFistFight> It HAS to be a Klingon reference too, since headbutting is a super fucking big show of balls to them also.
[1:52:49] <TheAntiNihilist> Sounds gay
[1:52:49] <Profmcstevie> We took the physical damage, he took the mental damage
[1:52:51] <hereiam407> I demand satisfaction sir
[1:52:56] <%Varlinator> Slap for him, minor brain damage for you? Meh, worth it
[1:52:57] <%ZephynM> I feel like if a Krogan took his glove off and slapped a human, their head would pop off.
[1:52:59] <+doc_ock_rokc> @dekkitout backhand of course
[1:52:59] <Jaysky> It's the difference between an open handed slap and a punch. A slap is a statement.
[1:52:59] <satans_finest_millennial> i know what im doing this winter
[1:53:01] <+Mr_Misanthropy> I would only be dumb founded as to wear my dueling pistol is :D
[1:53:07] <%ainzhelm> Should have worn a helmet shepherd
[1:53:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Shepard gave himself a concussion just so he could look like a big man.
[1:53:08] <Archmortal> one of the soft aliens dares to headbutt me harder than other krogan do?!
[1:53:09] <%Cykron> Shepard is half machine
[1:53:22] <%RubberFistFight> @ZephynM they'd just turn into bloody salsa chunks from the shoulders up.
[1:53:25] <Alzero83> a little dose of Moider
[1:53:27] <ScreamLord> Krogan Karen
[1:53:27] <satans_finest_millennial> mitten slap
[1:53:28] <seancbo> I really love how the game frequently points out that Shepard is a complete sociopath that loves murder above all else, but he just doesnt want to acknowledge it
[1:53:28] <$QueequegTheater> This dude is getting his dick so hard over murder
[1:53:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Shepard has a metal skull, tbf.
[1:53:44] <+FlongBongle> LETSGOOO
[1:53:53] <VentWilsn> shepard's middle name is "ADAPT"
[1:54:02] <+black_pariah> military in ME are amped up already and shep is cyborged out on top of that
[1:54:02] <peachy996> Ok Mr. Burns
[1:54:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @seancbo Yeah that's the best part of Javik's bromance in 3. Where he bonds with Shepard over the fact that war has turned them both into sociopaths.
[1:54:08] <%ZephynM> Dude sounded like MR Berns there.
[1:54:09] <jorniev> MORE MURDER PLEASE
[1:54:11] <%AncelDeLambert> @Too_Much_Nukie I mean, that's most sports
[1:54:15] <%RubberFistFight> @Cykron he has cybernetic implants, he's not "half machine". They're probably things like bone knitters, something to regulate his organs, we know there's a toxin filter in there since he can survive being poisoned. But he's not like fucking Robocop.
[1:54:17] <%polothegreatest> Mission: S U R V I V E
[1:54:19] <VentWilsn> MAKO RETURNS?
[1:54:21] <%StaceMcGate> I like how this mission is just a wave survival
[1:54:23] <+D00msDayDan> Pat do you have your upgrade guide ready
[1:54:23] <%Axellogic> If Mass effect was more about Krogans id prolly like it more in general
[1:54:24] <%dekkitout> Space Detroit
[1:54:25] <mak0t0yukii> What a dump
[1:54:27] <SaltyAzteca> Oh hey look its 2B!
[1:54:29] <%JohnAtDawn> LOOK AT THIS NIER LEVEL
[1:54:29] <VentWilsn> NVM
[1:54:31] <%AncelDeLambert> look at this HOLE
[1:54:31] <BigFingerRo> Vacation destination for sure!
[1:54:31] <%CatastropheCorvid> What is this, a Fallout 2 cinematic?
[1:54:31] <ScreamLord> I want a Krogan Fallout
[1:54:31] <%NateyBeak> detroit joke
[1:54:32] <Jaysky> Yo Pat, your playthrough is reminding me exactly why I loved ME2 so much
[1:54:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @RubberFistFight He's explicitly robocop.
[1:54:35] <%twistedj3ster> you just ran over WALL-E
[1:54:35] <seancbo> I only wish you got to drive that huge tank car thing
[1:54:37] <$QueequegTheater> Bruh this looks like Reach post-glassing
[1:54:38] <jorniev> MAD MAX TURTLES
[1:54:38] <+Grayhammatter> what a dump
[1:54:38] <Hellarussian> they Wrexed it
[1:54:39] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt it has looked like this before the Krogan Wars right?
[1:54:40] <penitentpendant> 2B shows up
[1:54:40] <thetunnelhomer> Can't have nothing on Tuchanka
[1:54:41] <vile_brand> thats just detroit a few years from now
[1:54:42] <seancbo> Looks like the clone transports from episode 2
[1:54:46] <%Varlinator> Everywhere's a chernolbl! YAY!
[1:54:47] <%Mattais88> Looks even more busted in 3
[1:54:48] <%AncelDeLambert> yo it's worm time
[1:54:48] <$realm_forge> Oh hey it’s modern day Detroit
[1:54:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @RubberFistFight The fact that Shepard is robocop is why Synthesis ending in ME3 needs Shepard's body to work.
[1:54:51] <stantheman_97> why are things on fire
[1:54:53] <+FlongBongle> JJ ABRAMS
[1:54:53] <RyeBreadBakery> detroit: become krogon
[1:54:54] <+Mr_Misanthropy> Tuchanaka that means buffalo :D
[1:54:57] <%Monkeyweed21> @RubberFistFight Shephard is literally 30% synthetic
[1:55:01] <%ape_hawk> nah, this is LA
[1:55:01] <blue8moon> seriously guys just take some time and clean up the place
[1:55:04] <%NateyBeak> its an abandoned failed mall but whole planet
[1:55:12] <+OneGorillionDollars> krogan are SO COOL
[1:55:16] <$realm_forge> LUL
[1:55:16] <%StaceMcGate> Is tuchanka looking like a shithole from the Krogan or the Krogan Wars?
[1:55:18] <%RubberFistFight> @Too_Much_Nukie He's AT MOST 30% cybernetic, this is explicitly pointed out in ME3.
[1:55:18] <%Cykron> WELCOME TO FIST OF THE NORTH STAR
[1:55:22] <DSD24> Thrive just like Krogans do
[1:55:24] <Broken_Sonex> Grunt's getting hype!
[1:55:24] <%JohnAtDawn> Spire from ME3
[1:55:25] <knight_verse> Technically their atmosphere is toxis as fuck, but the salarians built them giant towers that purify it.
[1:55:26] <peachy996> What a pretty planet
[1:55:28] <causewaybob> How is it worse if Shepard is renegade
[1:55:28] <%Axellogic> @blue8moon You cant fight if you are cleaning
[1:55:28] <RyeBreadBakery> krogans are SO COOL
[1:55:28] <%ZephynM> The landscape makes me think of, I think Crysis 2 when you're crossing a bridge.
[1:55:32] <thetunnelhomer> @StaceMcGate Yes
[1:55:32] <%Tman451> Looks like a Halo Orbital Elevator
[1:55:33] <$lotharrio> There's stuff to get, though!
[1:55:34] <hereiam407> You were here last game?
[1:55:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The only way you can say Shepard isn't robocop is if you consider someone to only be a cyborg if their brain has cybernetics. Shepard's brain is purely human. But his body is also largely synthetic.
[1:55:36] <VentWilsn> omg it is "survive"
[1:55:36] <Sp3ctre48> It's that one ship in Halo Keepo
[1:55:36] <%Varlinator> Spoilers
[1:55:37] <%MrBorisMakarov> I LOVE THIS MISSION
[1:55:37] <%Rumbutt> it's a space elevator?
[1:55:39] <Vikingincognito> WELCOME TO THE THUNDERDOME
[1:55:40] <%Retinolgaming> This part is pretty awesome.
[1:55:41] <%MrBorisMakarov> ITS SO FUCKING COOL
[1:55:42] <Tracazoid> "Could be a Thresher Maw, could be a kitten, we really don't know."
[1:55:51] <%42nfl19> I missed it but did @PatStaresAt do the headbutt interrupt?
[1:55:52] <RetributionP> Ace combat
[1:55:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You could've just done this shit before hitting the button Pat.
[1:55:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He did.
[1:56:00] <+FlongBongle> LUL
[1:56:08] <%JoshManVGH> It's a krogan form battle museum
[1:56:14] <Jaysky> Best pistol
[1:56:15] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt Fun fact, in that minigame the pairs always form on the circuit lines in the background
[1:56:15] <peachy996> Yeah it's cool
[1:56:17] <$lotharrio> That gun FUCKS
[1:56:19] <seancbo> I love the laser sight so much
[1:56:19] <+holsety5> shame they ruined the phalanx in 3
[1:56:20] <%ScottishMadJacko> Best pistol
[1:56:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> PHALANX HYPE
[1:56:23] <%Varlinator> YES IT DOES!
[1:56:24] <%OldOnyx> kind of reminds me of the Unum tower in warframe
[1:56:24] <%Cykron> BLUE LAZER SIGHTS
[1:56:26] <%dekkitout> That thing could give a hippo a closed casket funeral
[1:56:28] <%Axellogic> Heavy pistols are already great
[1:56:30] <+OneGorillionDollars> phalanx is bonkers
[1:56:31] <peachy996> The blue Lasersight is pretty
[1:56:32] <jillpilled> It's so goddamn good
[1:56:34] <%ape_hawk> yes
[1:56:35] <ScreamLord> It's the Mass Effect Dessert Eagle
[1:56:35] <+FlongBongle> yes
[1:56:37] <%ScottishMadJacko> aye
[1:56:37] <%AncelDeLambert> kinda
[1:56:38] <Hellarussian> maybe a little
[1:56:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Phalanx is so good they had to nerf it in 3 then make a new gun that's as strong as the old Phalanx was.
[1:56:39] <%SirGO0SE> m6kwCute im worthy?
[1:56:40] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> a little bit
[1:56:41] <%MrBorisMakarov> Me3MP beta
[1:56:41] <$QueequegTheater> Yes, waves and nothing else Kappa
[1:56:41] <%AncelDeLambert> get all non-medgel now
[1:56:42] <%StaceMcGate> you shot a space dog. Congrats on becoming a man
[1:56:46] <penitentpendant> Get your Coop preview in your Single Player
[1:56:47] <Archmortal> I hate that my favorite pistol in Mass Effect is only in Andromeda and is also arbitrarily weak as piss
[1:56:47] <+D00msDayDan> yes
[1:56:49] <%Daxalog> Just like the multiplayer.
[1:56:51] <%Cykron> This is a Quarian rescue mission rip off
[1:56:52] <seancbo> They based their entire culture on a game of CoD Zombies
[1:56:59] <Vikingincognito> what difficulty are you on?
[1:57:00] <$lotharrio> Feed your son and make him powerful!
[1:57:00] <Jaysky> It IS his trial after all
[1:57:04] <%brisk_dacat> Just sit back and let them work
[1:57:09] <%RubberFistFight> @Too_Much_Nukie Robocop was mostly machine in both his incarnations. Shepard is still majority human, with a few attachments to keep his shit running proper. The whole point was to bring him back with as few mods as possible since Cerberus wanted him to be exactly the same person he was before. Again - it comes up in conversation in ME3 and the TOTAL AMOUNT of cybernetic shit he has does not exceed 30%. This is not "largely cybernetic" since most of him is still flesh and blood.
[1:57:09] <%Varlinator> I mean you're on normal, so yeah
[1:57:12] <+Grayhammatter> so fast and so strong
[1:57:18] <peachy996> Grunt is having so much fun
[1:57:22] <%AncelDeLambert> just get ready to fight the giant earthworm
[1:57:29] <%Cykron> I AM THE STORM THAT IS APPROACHING
[1:57:29] <ScreamLord> Grunts having so much fun
[1:57:34] <%brisk_dacat> Grunt is to strong
[1:57:35] <jorniev> WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE
[1:57:35] <Flame_Water> Mass Effect 2 could have a Sonic 3D running level and still be the best game ever made
[1:57:41] <RetributionP> spoilblers
[1:57:41] <+FlongBongle> restart on hard, coward
[1:57:43] <%GarbageNirvana> You better goddamn kill the thresher maw
[1:57:43] <%Axellogic> Show this garbage planet whos boss
[1:57:44] <%MrBorisMakarov> @RubberFistFight i never thought about that, awesome
[1:57:52] <%rekinom> @Too_Much_Nukie Except that most of that flesh was lab grown. He was essentially a burnt spine and brain and not much else
[1:57:53] <+Mr_Misanthropy> Did they patch proper ME1 controller support to pc. Or is that exclusive to this collection LUL
[1:57:57] <%Varlinator> There's almost 0 challenge on Normal difficulty, which is why I always play on either Veteran or Hardcore.
[1:58:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @RubberFistFight He's still literally brought back from the dead and explicitly has metal bone marrow. So trying to run that back and say he's not a cyborg because he doesn't have ENOUGH cybernetics is nitpicking.
[1:58:16] <$QueequegTheater> Play on Hardcore coward
[1:58:23] <mak0t0yukii> LUL
[1:58:24] <$QueequegTheater> LUL

[1:58:30] <+critikal_bit> LUL
[1:58:30] <Hellarussian> how

[1:58:35] <%MugenSandan> UNWORTHY itmejpDED itmejpDED itmejpDED
[1:58:35] <%RubberFistFight> @MrBorisMakarov The conversation only happens if you're dating Traynor iirc, but I think either EDI or Mordin specifies it.
[1:58:36] <$QueequegTheater> THE DOGS, SHEPARD. I WANT TO PET THEM
[1:58:40] <peachy996> He's learning
[1:58:40] <Profmcstevie> WAKE UP TANK BOY
[1:58:40] <%Varlinator> Grunt pet the doggo too hard
[1:58:40] <signofzeta> did he stumble again?
[1:58:41] <NeroInfinite> ..Is that a nuke on pat's back? monkaS
[1:58:42] <VentWilsn> mulligan
[1:58:42] <%rockcentuar> Hey everyone just curious will pat looked at the codex for this game too ?
[1:58:43] <$lotharrio> Grunt got hurt. HahaBaby
[1:58:44] <seancbo> "THEY WILL KNOW IM WORTHY" *instantly dies*
[1:58:46] <%TheSpoonyBard27> Be careful, an enemy got stuck in the floor and softlocked me once
[1:58:46] <mak0t0yukii> UNWORTHY
[1:58:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The games make a point of the fact that Shepard is part synthetic and it's related to the synthetic/human conflict.
[1:58:49] <%Rumbutt> These beasts will know I'm worth--fuck
[1:58:53] <ScreamLord> Puberty Failed
[1:58:53] <Vikingincognito> Pat use the Cain AS SOON as the Thresher Maw pokes it head out. It can duck nderground and avoid the damage if you take too long
[1:58:59] <andrewofbob> Noclan Grunt
[1:58:59] <+Mr_Misanthropy> @ScreamLord I'm not surprised... but man that's messed up
[1:59:02] <%Faustgesicht> don't be mad, he's a baby

[1:59:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Vikingincognito lol or you can just wait until the fight proper starts.
[1:59:22] <hereiam407> Thats a big bug
[1:59:24] <LordOfThePoultry> monkaS
[1:59:24] <$lotharrio> Grunt has Pat's stand!
[1:59:25] <%Faustgesicht> NOOOO

[2:00:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You don't need the cain to defeat the thresher maw.
[2:00:07] <%Daxalog> 😡
[2:00:07] <%sunsetdisc0> waynerSob
[2:00:08] <%daemonazaezal> not the fire boys

[2:00:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt You're fine. Everyone is being scrubs. Just beat the thresher maw without the cain.
[2:00:32] <Profmcstevie> IT WAS FUNNY, MAINTAIN COURSE
[2:00:32] <%Torus1025> Nice
[2:00:33] <mesamus> theres a big worm by the end,

[2:00:37] <Sp3ctre48> Doesn't really matter the game is easy as shit regardless
[2:00:38] <%charp35> It's not that important

[2:00:55] <AxelCezar> brucegScared brucegScared
[2:00:55] <%ScottishMadJacko> I mean, I wasn't suggesting he restart
[2:00:56] <%RubberFistFight> @Too_Much_Nukie Sorry you can't handle being wrong, dude. Copious amounts of info in the game, including conversations, x-ray data visible on screens, and an entire video you can find on a side-quest in 3, confirm Shep as being vast majority human with some extra stuff to keep his body running in pristine shape. Also, it's not nitpicking. You said "majority cyborg". He's not. He's majority organic. Unless you think 30 is bigger than 70.
[2:00:58] <%MidnightBurst12> it was fine but ok
[2:00:59] <$lotharrio> It's always the eclipse on Tchanka
[2:01:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It really doesn't matter.
[2:01:04] <jorniev> NEVERCHILL
[2:01:08] <+black_pariah> i saved my cain charge in me3 for damn near the whole game and wasted it on a half dead banshee
[2:01:13] <+mai_waifu_> "Relax" I think you mean move on to the next upset.
[2:01:26] <+mai_waifu_> taggWat taggWat
[2:01:33] <%StaceMcGate> don't have two paragraph long debates in chat please
[2:01:34] <%ScottishMadJacko> @too_much_nukie funny how you say that after being proved wrong, just saying
[2:01:35] <$realm_forge> redit pickup to the left of the button
[2:01:41] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @RubberFistFight His flesh is artificial, his entire skeleton contains artificial matter, his skin has nanogel woven into it. That's majority cyborg.
[2:01:49] <$realm_forge> Credit
[2:01:58] <BigFingerRo> CHAT, I NEED AN EXTRA PAIR OF HANDS HERE, MY PANTIES ARE NOT NEARLY ENOUGH IN A BUNCH

[2:02:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I literally beat 3 last night dude.
[2:02:12] <%Garthunox> @Too_Much_Nukie So when you two gonna kiss? or you gonna take it to dms?
[2:02:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Even his organic bits were grown.
[2:02:24] <%dekkitout> Whats worse than the space dragon to use a nuke laser on?
[2:02:26] <%RubberFistFight> @Too_Much_Nukie Lol no it's not. You're fabricating shit wholecloth now. Tell me more about shepards "metal bone marrow" LUL
[2:02:27] <peachy996> DLC Guns baby. Who cares if they're stronger than base weapons
[2:02:34] <Profmcstevie> organic being grown is still organic
[2:02:34] <%RetroCop87> oh baby oh baby
[2:02:38] <+holsety5> freeze ammo bad
[2:02:40] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @RubberFistFight LITERALLY AN UPGRADE IN THIS GAME.
[2:02:46] <%Garthunox> Oh my god please, both of you take it to dms
[2:02:50] <%ScottishMadJacko> @too_much_nukie grown flesh isn't cyborg tough, cyborg is metal and electronics and plastic and shit
[2:02:56] <%brisk_dacat> Bugs are cold blooded so it take awhile
[2:03:03] <%StaceMcGate> @Too_Much_Nukie @RubberFistFight take it to DMS
[2:03:04] <ScreamLord> The ants explode
[2:03:13] <$lotharrio> Grunt stop calling out your attacks like it's an anime. You're embarrassing me in front of the shaman.
[2:03:13] <%RubberFistFight> @Profmcstevie Yup. He's also ignoring that you see his skeleton onscreen in big detail at the beginning of 2 and it's mostly complete, just in a few more pieces than usual.
[2:03:14] <peachy996> I like that games can be OP in this series and everyone welcomes it because it's SP+Horde Mode
[2:03:14] <intestinal_bleeding> fucker blew up
[2:03:18] <$QueequegTheater> @brisk_dacat that's not how that works
[2:03:21] <%RetroCop87> TOUCH GUNS PAT

[2:03:27] <peachy996> *guns
[2:03:31] <%ScottishMadJacko> no, don't take it to dms, I want to see the full thinf
[2:03:35] <captain_kirkhammer> Oh man I'm getting an ad for the new Purge movie I thought that shit was over
[2:03:36] <%Varlinator> Chat I forget - What's the reaper dragons in 3 called made from Kilxen?
[2:03:41] <%GarbageNirvana> Every kill makes him nut harder
[2:03:41] <%MidnightBurst12> gotta get the aggro juices out
[2:03:42] <%JoshManVGH> Oh yeah... I remember this now

[2:03:54] <%dekkitout> @lotharrio Chuni Grunt, Naruto running and styling on fools LUL

[2:04:01] <%StaceMcGate> woooorms
[2:04:04] <%ScottishMadJacko> @varlinator harvesters right?
[2:04:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> So the dialogue at the end of 3 is overwritten by the shitty skeleton art in 2's character creator.
[2:04:14] <%GarbageNirvana> FUCKIN KILL IT
[2:04:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's the evidence you're talking about.

[2:04:24] <%Varlinator> @strugglepunk2 @ScottishMadJacko That's it, thanks
[2:04:25] <%RubberFistFight> @StaceMcGate Oh so THIS is why Paige is always checking her burgers.
[2:04:26] <%JoshManVGH> Man the Krogan existence is predominantly centered around fighting giant insects.
[2:04:26] <%MrBorisMakarov> that thing fucks
[2:04:26] <+EvilErickan> I love that gun
[2:04:27] <%brisk_dacat> Wait the thing from borderlands??
[2:04:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And the cyborg upgrades you get in this very game are ignored.
[2:04:30] <%shadowsofpain> Holy fuck
[2:04:31] <%dekkitout> That was quite a bit of damage

[2:05:17] <%aWanderingKaivo> Outright nuke it. Finish it with a handgun
[2:05:17] <%brisk_dacat> Did borderlands still the thresher from this game?
[2:05:19] <$QueequegTheater> Nobody cares

[2:05:56] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> THE ULTIMATE BIOKROGAN

[2:06:25] <stantheman_97> THE ULTIMATE BIOWEAPON
[2:06:32] <Laecerelius> FUCK UP WORF! DROP A FUCKING BLUE BARREL ON HIS BITCH SPINE!
[2:06:33] <$lotharrio> "Dude, we already have an in with Urdnot. Why would we fucking bother with your shithole clan?"
[2:06:33] <%williamrooster> this is the worst sell
[2:06:38] <%maskofmichael> @ape_hawk Yeah, they both have huge asses
[2:06:40] <%dekkitout> NO HONOR!

[2:06:46] <BlueLunecy> This dude sucks at this
[2:06:47] <$realm_forge> The Krogan word for chad is Grunt
[2:06:53] <%StaceMcGate> the worst negotiator
[2:06:55] <peachy996> Make nice with the dust
[2:07:00] <%Monkeyweed21> THROW A BARREL AT HIM
[2:07:01] <Broken_Sonex> @ape_hawk Holy shit, you're right
[2:07:13] <$realm_forge> THATS IT HIT HIM WITH THE BARREL
[2:07:16] <intestinal_bleeding> did he pull that gun from his neck
[2:07:22] <%Garthunox> @Too_Much_Nukie you can go through the first game without ever seeing one, and you can also not be a sole survivor, so its pretty much ignored
[2:07:23] <+FlongBongle> well that was a mistake Gatatog
[2:07:24] <mak0t0yukii> RENEGADE
[2:07:28] <Jaysky> AAA-
[2:07:30] <%42nfl19> Renegade and Pragon?
[2:07:31] <+EvilErickan> I love Gurnt
[2:07:35] <%brisk_dacat> So much death
[2:07:39] <Sp3ctre48> I can't charge it BabyRage
[2:07:40] <peachy996> It's nice of him to tell you what gun to use
[2:07:40] <%aWanderingKaivo> that cutscene was wrong. shepguard would have just charged
[2:07:41] <DSD24> Can't target them
[2:07:43] <VentWilsn> like how the cameraman also had to vault the barrier
[2:07:46] <Vikingincognito> My problem with this mission is that it makes no sense that Uvenk would even make an offer like that. Did he think Grunt was insane? Why would he a gree to be a 2nd class member?
[2:07:50] <%RetroCop87> Can't reach the target... lol jk
[2:07:50] <CurrySauseBandit> There's no tention in combat anymore :c
[2:07:51] <%SuckerPunchSyd> hit him with the barrel!
[2:07:52] <%Varlinator> They have surprisingly clean armour
[2:07:55] <jorniev> imagine a human beating a krogan to death
[2:07:56] <ChungusQuest> he got some good hits in though, right?
[2:07:58] <$QueequegTheater> Yeah Krogan are way less intimidating in combat in 2 and 3
[2:07:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Garthunox Yeah the Spacer origin has the most content associated with it because you have a living parent. Everything else is more or less ignored.
[2:08:01] <Minorou> "Let's just attack the guys who just killed a Thresher Maw on foot. What can go wrong?"
[2:08:04] <NeroInfinite> He's freezing the fregs
[2:08:07] <+vaderxyz1970> Everytime a Krogans dies I cry a little inside
[2:08:07] <NitronStreams> He could have had 1 amazing Krogan... now he'll have a dozen dead Krogans
[2:08:08] <%brisk_dacat> This ain’t helping the population guys
[2:08:12] <BigFingerRo> So, everyone dislikes Grunt because he is a house Grogan?
[2:08:14] <Shadope342> COUNTERED
[2:08:15] <andrewofbob> This is a lot of Claymores
[2:08:16] <+FlongBongle> LMAO
[2:08:17] <mak0t0yukii> HE'S SUPER DEAD
[2:08:18] <%StaceMcGate> welp Worf is dead
[2:08:19] <+holsety5> he just broke like glass
[2:08:19] <tuesti> LUL
[2:08:20] <BlueLunecy> The only difference between Grunt and Miranda is that Grunt LOVES being perfect
[2:08:21] <$lotharrio> @Vikingincognito I guess he was hoping to intimidate Grunt.
[2:08:21] <%walternatorz> LUL
[2:08:21] <%MrBorisMakarov> OH NO HES DEAD
[2:08:22] <%Taisuru> F

[2:08:22] <$QueequegTheater> MORDIN FUCKING DISINTEGRATED HIM
[2:08:23] <peachy996> He shattered him

[2:08:42] <%polothegreatest> rot? hes dust now
[2:08:43] <Jaysky> @minorou To be fair if you just fought a thrrsher maw you'd probably be weakened a bit
[2:08:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Or is it just cash?
[2:08:48] <peachy996> You can put him in your drink now
[2:08:49] <RDknight> you sure you didnt miss anything pat?

[2:13:28] <%Ipsenscastle> talk to wrex about grunt first
[2:13:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pull isn't as good when you don't have throw to combo.
[2:13:33] <%shadowsofpain> @patstaresat for mordin's mission bring Tali for good dialog
[2:13:34] <+CyanDeadEye> Now that you've completed Grunt's loyalty

[2:14:23] <%goose_attack_almanac> @Too_Much_Nukie I just like Tali.
[2:14:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat probably won't get the Tali line everyone has seen too.
[2:14:24] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt GO back to the normandy there's a good dialogue thing on the way
[2:14:25] <James_Quivers> Tali for prime girlfriend bullying
[2:14:26] <Sp3ctre48> It's a good line though Keepo
[2:14:28] <captain_kirkhammer> @Too_Much_Nukie more than special grunt dialogue

[2:14:49] <+FlongBongle> grunt
[2:14:51] <%Garthunox> @QueequegTheater he can go back after mordins, it doesnt auto send you back on hub planets
[2:14:54] <%ainzhelm> Garrus has a funny line that he references later in the citadel dlc, about his favorite places to have shoutouts
[2:14:55] <+CyanDeadEye> In Mordin's loyalty, Tali gets one line, Garrus gets a a single line callback in the Citadel DLC but only if you take him.
[2:14:57] <$QueequegTheater> This guy counts
[2:15:00] <penitentpendant> Isn't this the one with Garru's "You never take me to anywhere nice to firefight" comment?
[2:15:02] <+senfood> The krogan are so damn hardcore.
[2:15:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat also is doing mostly paragon so he probably won't get the Tali line anyway.
[2:15:19] <Profmcstevie> If you kill ten, you can just work by process of elimination hboxBrain
[2:15:25] <+CyanDeadEye> @penitentpendant yes.
[2:15:30] <peachy996> yeah it's one line but what does Grunt say in this mission?
[2:15:37] <captain_kirkhammer> @Too_Much_Nukie the tali line is in response to a paragon dialoguw
[2:15:39] <peachy996> Let her say the one line
[2:15:40] <penitentpendant> @CyanDeadEye One of my favorites!
[2:15:52] <jorniev> that's fucked up
[2:15:53] <+MisterAvry> do we ever seen child krogans?
[2:15:57] <+vaderxyz1970> Wow that's dark
[2:16:00] <%Dakuu75> HONOR
[2:16:01] <$QueequegTheater> No
[2:16:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's in response to the renegade persuade check with the sick Krogan.
[2:16:04] <BigFingerRo> whatever
[2:16:07] <%za7az> @MisterAvry GRUNT
[2:16:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> When you compare him to a Quarian.

[2:16:19] <Profmcstevie> Or a rock
[2:16:20] <%StaceMcGate> you dont need to go back to the ship to change party members
[2:16:21] <peachy996> @MisterAvry ME3 ending and MEA artwork
[2:16:23] <Profmcstevie> a rock with legs
[2:16:26] <+senfood> YA DAMN RIGHT
[2:16:27] <+vaderxyz1970> They show up in 3's ending
[2:16:28] <RetributionP> pats got a quad
[2:16:34] <%rekinom> Do you think the first word Wrex teaches them is "Shepard" ?
[2:16:36] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt We see baby Krogans in the Extended Cut ending for ME3, they're adorable
[2:16:36] <%Varlinator> They show a picture of a babby krogan in 3
[2:16:41] <%shadowsofpain> thank to Andromeda we know what hyper old krigan look like too
[2:16:43] <%aWanderingKaivo> You never see child krogan because they are buried by their hundreds of dead siblings
[2:16:44] <$QueequegTheater> KROGAN WHY
[2:16:48] <%williamrooster> arn't they more like turtles
[2:16:50] <%shadowsofpain> krogan
[2:17:04] <peachy996> You interrupted it
[2:17:07] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Krogan interrupted it, this isn't my fault
[2:17:09] <captain_kirkhammer> You didn't get the line people wanted because you activated those two krogan @PatStaresAt
[2:17:13] <BigFingerRo> EVERY DAY WITH THE PYJAKS
[2:17:18] <%Noir_Valdr> shoulda stopped
[2:17:18] <BigFingerRo> ENOUGHT WITH THE PYKAK
[2:17:20] <RDknight> talk to joker
[2:17:23] <peachy996> the krogan interrupted it when you walked into them
[2:17:25] <%Noir_Valdr> and listened
[2:17:28] <%dekkitout> To the deth?
[2:17:29] <VentWilsn> thats kinda fucked considering krogan also have scales i think
[2:17:31] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I can't believe you would fight a man wearing glasses who's only twice your size
[2:17:34] <Vikingincognito> Pat fucked up, as usual
[2:17:35] <%doctordinkus> "we'll show those ~blanks~ who's boss" has to be the most overused line in media
[2:17:35] <%Noir_Valdr> instead of walking to trigger the other dialogue lol
[2:17:35] <%GarbageNirvana> There was supposed to be a line there yeah
[2:17:38] <%brisk_dacat> Will you fight us in smash??
[2:17:38] <SaltyAzteca> Headbutt us all Shepat!!
[2:17:38] <%Kitafin> Have at thee
[2:17:41] <peachy996> Go ahead, I got nothing to do
[2:17:41] <$SGrim> @aWanderingKaivo False. They show them in 3.
[2:17:42] <%twistedj3ster> Pat will jump up and bite us
[2:17:42] <%MidnightBurst12> do it coward
[2:17:52] <%GarbageNirvana> Pat is the one guy this time
[2:17:52] <RDknight> i think he says a line at the end of each mission
[2:17:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The line people are thinking about is if you exit the normandy with grunt in your squad on Tuchanka.
[2:18:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> After the loyalty mission.
[2:18:07] <Laecerelius> Pat will bite you like a rabid little monkey man!
[2:18:07] <romc215> There is no such thing as heat-butting capacity
[2:18:09] <Dunmarkh> that's bitch energy joker
[2:18:10] <%brisk_dacat> Will get Paige to kick you in the shin again
[2:18:11] <$QueequegTheater> Pat I would just hold my hand on your forehead and you wouldn't be able to reach me
[2:18:14] <%Taisuru> But what if more headbutting
[2:18:17] <%ainzhelm> If you’ve seen the Tali line, maybe try the garrus line this time
[2:18:21] <%aWanderingKaivo> I was making a facetious joke but ok
[2:18:23] <%doctordinkus> christ I hate seth green
[2:18:28] <+vaderxyz1970> Hey Wrex Joker wants to play Grid Iron with you!
[2:18:28] <%Lizard0TM> no?
[2:18:32] <peachy996> The line is basically that Grunt gets a bunch of Breeding requests, and one request for Shepherd
[2:18:37] <peachy996> And Grunt goes HA
[2:18:42] <%Cykron> A headbutt would kill Joker
[2:18:44] <stantheman_97> there's like three people on the crew that will probably headbutt people. which is a lot
[2:18:48] <%daemonazaezal> it happens all the time in me2
[2:18:49] <$SGrim> @vaderxyz1970 He will persih. GOOD!
[2:18:51] <$QueequegTheater> Halloween colors nice
[2:18:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Honestly guys if you want to see every single minor line of dialogue you can also play the game yourself. There's so god damn much ambient dialogue in these games.
[2:18:59] <%Lizard0TM> the DLC look is better
[2:19:00] <%rockcentuar> mods
[2:19:03] <%dekkitout> Grunt Freeman

[2:19:10] <$QueequegTheater> He's a giant scaly pumpkin now
[2:19:16] <%doctordinkus> @too_much_nukie facts
[2:19:22] <peachy996> DLC makes him look like C-Sec
[2:19:27] <$SGrim> Are you taking Grunt on Mordin's mission?
[2:19:29] <Dunmarkh> Shepard getting requests for that krussy
[2:19:33] <%ItalianWaifu> wait aren't you doing Mordins mission
[2:19:37] <%Cykron> Grunt looks like he's ready to cause a Resonance Cascade
[2:19:44] <%doctordinkus> @scottishmadjacko his voice, his career, the god awful stuff he's been in, his face,
[2:19:49] <Vikingincognito> Hell yeah, I love the little squad shot as you exit the shuttle
[2:19:53] <blackjack8182> Mordin doesn’t need to go on his own mission
[2:19:57] <peachy996> There we go

[2:20:40] <%JoshManVGH> Mysterious Human/Krogan hybrid kicking ass throughout the galaxy.
[2:20:42] <%Ynkubus_> lady krogan wants shepard spooge
[2:20:45] <blackjack8182> Krussy
[2:20:45] <%Garthunox> CRUSH THE KRUSSY!
[2:20:46] <%ItalianWaifu> slap Grunt on the ass and tell him to go get it
[2:20:47] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt would a Krogan venereal disease be Kristy Krabs?
[2:20:49] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I think it's much funnier if it's femShep because that implies a krogan wants her to dom him
[2:20:50] <%shadowsofpain> @unhuggable1 yup
[2:20:51] <%shurtal> Grunt just did his Bar Mitzvah and all the Lady Krogan want some of that
[2:20:51] <$hattrick61> krussy snusnu
[2:20:52] <peachy996> The request was from Wrex
[2:20:52] <satans_finest_millennial> GUYS NOO its NOT like Bad Dragon
[2:20:56] <captain_kirkhammer> @42nfl19 this isn't star trek, no one crossbreeds with anything, the asari do randomized parthenogenesis
[2:20:57] <$SGrim> krusty*
[2:20:58] <%Taisuru> Idiot
[2:21:02] <$realm_forge> And that’s how Shepard cured the genophage
[2:21:07] <+titansloth93> quads, that's cute
[2:21:08] <%daemonazaezal> im pretty sure it does happen as fem shep
[2:21:13] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Hey at least Shepard will have something to hold onto.
[2:21:21] <Jaysky> Ever?
[2:21:22] <%Garthunox> @QueequegTheater How does it imply that?
[2:21:24] <peachy996> You are right
[2:21:27] <Vikingincognito> What Paragon interupt are you talking about?
[2:21:33] <KingSpunf> If Krogans have 4 nutsacks, does that mean the women have 2 krogussies?
[2:21:40] <peachy996> Saving someone I bet
[2:21:43] <%Deft_Thought> That dude's armor is neat
[2:21:50] <James_Quivers> Nut Rage
[2:21:52] <$QueequegTheater> @Garthunox you think Krogan don't also have dommy mommy fetishes just like us
[2:21:53] <$SGrim> @QueequegTheater Or, there's at least one Bi or Lesbian Krogette.
[2:22:09] <captain_kirkhammer> @Deft_Thought looks like that claymore manga
[2:22:18] <+MisterAvry> haha quads, i get it
[2:22:22] <%Garthunox> @QueequegTheater thats not what i asked, i asked how does it imply what you said it implied
[2:22:22] <%42nfl19> Is this a side mission or loyalty mission? This rescue op?
[2:22:23] <James_Quivers> Oh man imagine testicular torsion with 4 balls
[2:22:26] <SilverFaustX> kazuya is out
[2:22:32] <Jaysky> Friendly for krogans
[2:22:33] <%Dakuu75> BEST friends
[2:22:37] <stantheman_97> friendly racists
[2:22:42] <captain_kirkhammer> @James_Quivers testicular newton's cradle
[2:22:42] <%Garthunox> @James_Quivers SHUT
[2:22:44] <%AsHeadsIsTails> Friendly by Krogan standards
[2:22:47] <dreu81> clan warlock?! RAD
[2:22:47] <$SGrim> @James_Quivers Testicular braiding.
[2:22:54] <%shadowsofpain> @sgrim yeah due to the genophage I imagine being a lesbian Krogan would be seen as bad
[2:22:59] <baconlord38> Strange. I can see the chat but can't see Pat's stream.
[2:23:02] <SilverFaustX> also twitter changed
[2:23:09] <%Dakuu75> @SGrim fucking, NOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:23:10] <$QueequegTheater> @Garthunox Because it's a male krogan who sees Shepard kill a thresher maw and asks to be bred by her
[2:23:13] <%dekkitout> 20? People barely win 3! What's quasar?
[2:23:15] <romc215> Imagine a Bukake with 4 testicles, splooge tidal wave
[2:23:22] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh shit there's an update patch for GG:Strive

[2:23:33] <peachy996> Vorcha aren't even considered sentient lol
[2:23:43] <+MisterAvry> that's a big racism at the vorcha
[2:23:45] <%Garthunox> @QueequegTheater wouldnt he want to breed with her?
[2:23:47] <%Taisuru> FURY
[2:23:48] <captain_kirkhammer> which is bullshit, they totally are
[2:23:49] <Jaysky> Got the gief
[2:23:50] <NitronStreams> HE NEEDS IT
[2:23:51] <+titansloth93> BIG JUMPS
[2:23:51] <%shurtal> HE MUST FETCH

[2:23:52] <VentWilsn> is squasar Mass Effect's version of Pazzak?
[2:23:55] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Bllood rage!
[2:23:55] <satans_finest_millennial> @romc215 Anime is Lizard people
[2:23:55] <%GinAndRoses> powerful gief
[2:23:57] <$SGrim> @shadowsofpain Possible, or they could just be required to incubate with donated sperm. Harsh, but still valuable to the species survival.
[2:23:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Vorcha have more in common with planar worms than anything else.
[2:24:02] <romc215> One of these days Zangief is going to bite Pat's hand off
[2:24:04] <%williamrooster> FEAR THE BLOODRAGE
[2:24:05] <NitronStreams> He must satisfy his blood rage!
[2:24:09] <%doctordinkus> the worst thing about games like this is that it's impossible to parse out the world building you don't give a fuck about
[2:24:09] <%twistedj3ster> Gief needs to kil a thresher maw
[2:24:12] <+TheBitingIrish> FATHER, THE VIOLENCE

[2:24:33] <$QueequegTheater> @Garthunox If he's got the ability to submit a request, he's passed the Rite. Nobody has beaten a maw in hundreds of years, that means he KNOWS she's stronger than him, therefore she would top

[2:32:54] <trianglehat> hot take shepard
[2:32:56] <SiameseSneeze> YEAAAh, lets use those disgusting Batarians
[2:32:58] <+senfood> SLOPPY
[2:33:00] <$QueequegTheater> Cerberus did nothing wrong, says Shepard
[2:33:03] <+gregpivo> Hope Gief's been doing all right with the heat
[2:33:03] <%aWanderingKaivo> humans: disgusting, unethical, sloppy. He's totally right
[2:33:04] <%MidnightBurst12> slow down there
[2:33:05] <%Varlinator> It's true. We are pretty gross
[2:33:06] <%BlackMage66652> SHEPARD SUPPORTS THE FOURTH REICH
[2:33:06] <+The_monster_hunter> VERY casual racism
[2:33:09] <%dekkitout> Wha- Mordy, ya made the genophage dude, how's this too far
[2:33:09] <$QueequegTheater> SLOPPEH
[2:33:10] <%walternatorz> great scene explaining why humans are worth testing on
[2:33:12] <akitanito> humans too sloppy and messy
[2:33:13] <TurtlesAndTentacles> dude youre just racist
[2:33:14] <Zalapski> pat, will you be zangiefs krantt
[2:33:14] <%42nfl19> So is this a loyalty or side mission?
[2:33:18] <%daemonazaezal> PAT, SAVE THE DATA
[2:33:24] <%daemonazaezal> Loyallty for mordin
[2:33:26] <%brisk_dacat> Eww you kiss those burgers with that mouth
[2:33:30] <willsin4fun> this shot looks perfect for the stretch face/neck meme
[2:33:35] <%bassoontyphoon> @42nfl19 mordin loyalty
[2:33:39] <%dekkitout> ...
[2:33:39] <+Ghufufin> lol
[2:33:41] <notsoy> calculus lmao
[2:33:48] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Remember humans can do calculus.
[2:33:48] <peachy996> I forgot most of this mission involves you going for Mordin
[2:33:50] <%Taisuru> USING HUMANS IS WRONG THO
[2:33:51] <James_Quivers> If they only know algebra, fuck em
[2:33:52] <%dekkitout> So humans are allowed
[2:33:54] <+senfood> That's a very good rule.
[2:33:55] <$QueequegTheater> Candygram for Mordin
[2:33:55] <Dunmarkh> fuck I can't do calculus
[2:33:56] <penitentpendant> The true value of passing math class: Aliens don't experiment on you
[2:34:02] <%Monkeyweed21> So Paige is allowed
[2:34:06] <NeroInfinite> "oh they can do math, so yeah no need to use these guys."
[2:34:11] <romc215> When you think about it, humans are the most useless species in Mass Effect. Krogan are badasses, Salarians are super scientists, Asari are blue biotic wizards. But humans, they're just boring
[2:34:12] <%bassoontyphoon> So Mordin would experiment on cops got it
[2:34:12] <%williamrooster> why experiment on humans when there's plenty of filthy batarians to use
[2:34:14] <%brisk_dacat> Why does Paige make a good body pillow for that dog
[2:34:25] <$QueequegTheater> @Dunmarkh I can and we're same species. I got you bro
[2:34:45] <$QueequegTheater> @brisk_dacat bulldogs make everyone their own bodypillow
[2:34:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @romc215 Nah humans are the wildcards. Mordin is talking about that right now.
[2:34:48] <James_Quivers> this being a plot point for the end of the game is huge
[2:34:49] <romc215> Humans are just lab rats, in other words
[2:34:49] <%jackelzxaa> jackelzxaa subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:34:53] <%JoshManVGH> I feel like that's an implication that Mordin has done experiments on developing sapient species who hadn't gotten to calculus yet...
[2:34:54] <%mads_valentine> Humans are gooey.
[2:34:55] <%Varlinator> Peaks & Valleys! LUL
[2:35:06] <blue8moon> humans actually don't have a lot of genetic variance LUL
[2:35:06] <romc215> @Too_Much_Nukie Sounds more like he's describing them as perfect lab rats
[2:35:08] <peachy996> so special
[2:35:14] <andrewofbob> No, idiots are common
[2:35:16] <jorniev> this explains why the collectors kidnapped humans
[2:35:17] <Marpolo13> LUL
[2:35:17] <+tigerfang86> OH NO
[2:35:19] <%42nfl19> Hurray?
[2:35:20] <@commanderclaw> It's not my fault they all have the same model
[2:35:20] <James_Quivers> Very meta of the game to acknowledge steraeotypes, yeah
[2:35:21] <%walternatorz> why'd you murder ashley??
[2:35:22] <%OldOnyx> that seems.... highly suspect on every level
[2:35:22] <%BlackMage66652> oof
[2:35:25] <willyfreshness> Krogans drive like this
[2:35:28] <TioXyco> are you validating Ashe?!
[2:35:31] <%MidnightBurst12> oh boy
[2:35:31] <Dunmarkh> fuckin battarians
[2:35:32] <$Solid_Stro> Thanks Pat
[2:35:35] <romc215> Humans suck
[2:35:35] <%MugenSandan> Sure thing Ashleu
[2:35:37] <Vikingincognito> This also was supposed to play into the "Dark Energy" ending
[2:35:38] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Follow the science
[2:35:40] <%logoth_> "Special"
[2:35:41] <%GinAndRoses> ever notice that Asari drive their starships like this, but Turians drive like this
[2:35:43] <NeroInfinite> He right humans vary wildly
[2:35:43] <$QueequegTheater> #AshleyDidNothingWrong
[2:35:44] <%dekkitout> I suppose if I inhale monoxide for 5 minutes, I could see the reason in that
[2:35:44] <James_Quivers> YES ALL BATARIANS
[2:35:45] <%walternatorz> Badtarians
[2:35:46] <+SilverDevilfish> We're special because we wrote the script Kappa
[2:35:48] <Zalapski> all salarians sing Gilbert and Sullivan?
[2:35:48] <%Wallabri> psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong
[2:35:48] <%BlackMage66652> ASHLEY DID NOTHING WRONG
[2:35:48] <mak0t0yukii> Even Ashley?
[2:35:49] <TioXyco> BADtarians
[2:35:49] <+EvilErickan> Fuck batarians
[2:35:51] <%ape_hawk> Batarians = Space North Koreans
[2:35:51] <%Mattais88> Who's worse Batarian or Vorcha?
[2:35:51] <%JoshManVGH> 26th Century Phernology
[2:35:52] <$Solid_Stro> Agreed
[2:35:53] <%ainzhelm> Oooooooooooooh ok
[2:35:53] <Laecerelius> Batarians are genetically predisposed to being horrible slavers!
[2:35:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Vikingincognito I've never heard that before lol
[2:35:54] <%Maids4lyfe> batarians are a mistake
[2:35:59] <Josef_Stryker> RENEGADE PROMPT
[2:35:59] <%ape_hawk> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:36:00] <SiameseSneeze> Fuck yeah
[2:36:01] <ioci2112> I really hate that mass effect really leaned on the whole "humans are specials and they totally save the universe" in me2 and me3
[2:36:01] <%toolofparanoia> FILTHY SLAVERS
[2:36:03] <%Varlinator> HERE WE GO!
[2:36:04] <%walternatorz> YEAHYEAHYEAH
[2:36:04] <Dunmarkh> We still have purple ashley in this party
[2:36:04] <+Ghufufin> all Multi species series has some bullshit reason why Humans are THE SPECIAL
[2:36:04] <%JoshManVGH> Bang, boom
[2:36:04] <%bassoontyphoon> I guess this is the justification for why the reapers want human colonies
[2:36:04] <stantheman_97> i guess this is because of our nomadic natural making us spread across the planet early on
[2:36:05] <%Rumbutt> yeyeyeyeyeye
[2:36:07] <Josef_Stryker> THE BEST PROMPT
[2:36:07] <%Ipsenscastle> It's honestly a pretty elegant explanation for homogenous sci-fi cultures
[2:36:07] <%Rumbutt> IT'S TIME
[2:36:08] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Renegade!
[2:36:08] <peachy996> Best Renegade Interrupt
[2:36:10] <%ainzhelm> AND BATARIANS LOOK UGLY
[2:36:12] <jorniev> JESUS THIS PART
[2:36:14] <%aWanderingKaivo> ever notice that asari, the all female species, have ships with big holes in the center as opposed to a long hull
[2:36:14] <xcompleasedad> Chat, has he used the Mini-Nuke yet?
[2:36:16] <penitentpendant> Ah yes, the 'can you resist the renegade prompt' test
[2:36:16] <%Varlinator> GET THAT RT READY!
[2:36:17] <%JoshManVGH> Guld Dukat!?
[2:36:20] <captain_kirkhammer> MESSAGE OF OUR CUMMING
[2:36:21] <%MidnightBurst12> TIME TO SHINE
[2:36:21] <+The_Death_Owl> screw the Batarians tiffosSaria
[2:36:21] <knight_verse> Well i mean, we are special
[2:36:28] <intestinal_bleeding> TELL EM ABOUT OUR CUM
[2:36:31] <$QueequegTheater> @Mattais88 Batarians choose to be evil, vorcha are genetically designed to be influenced by their environment
[2:36:42] <penitentpendant> @xcompleasedad Against the Worm, took out about 2/3rds it's hp
[2:36:43] <$Sdeje> He's talking shit about Wrex
[2:36:43] <blackjack8182> RENEGADE!
[2:36:45] <%goose_attack_almanac> Mordin is so unimpressed.
[2:36:46] <jorniev> THEY REALLY WANT YOU TO PICK THE RENEGADE OPTION
[2:36:48] <nuane> why are krogans like this
[2:36:49] <Vikingincognito> This guy's speech is metal as fuck
[2:36:49] <romc215> Everyone has to die!
[2:36:51] <%walternatorz> they do.
[2:36:51] <RDknight> wait for the last second!
[2:36:52] <tanarath> Any kind of predisposition spoiled be minor and any genetic benefit wouldn't need human being testing.
[2:36:52] <NeroInfinite> Ah I see
[2:37:00] <%BlackMage66652> Pat lied as easy as he breathed
[2:37:01] <%GarbageNirvana> He goes for a fuckin while if you let him doesn't he
[2:37:02] <%walternatorz> they have to die in a blaze of gorly
[2:37:05] <xcompleasedad> @penitentpendant I MISSED THAT???? Fuck
[2:37:07] <%walternatorz> glory*
[2:37:08] <%jackelzxaa> let him go for a bit before you trigger
[2:37:11] <%dekkitout> psaCrazyhand .... he's got a point
[2:37:12] <%Varlinator> oof
[2:37:16] <%mads_valentine> Dead baby piles.
[2:37:19] <captain_kirkhammer> This is a good VA wonder who he is
[2:37:28] <%bassoontyphoon> He’s got a point though
[2:37:28] <%jackelzxaa> mordin waves you when it's pretty close to near the end
[2:37:31] <penitentpendant> @xcompleasedad TBF, he used it on something else and chat yelled at him to restart the mission
[2:37:32] <iosephe> millions ain't that much
[2:37:35] <jorniev> iT GIVES YOU 3 CHANSES FOR THIS RENEGADE
[2:37:39] <romc215> @mads_valentine Science cannot progress without dead baby piles
[2:37:40] <%aWanderingKaivo> this is a pretty brutal scenario tbh
[2:37:40] <Josef_Stryker> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:37:43] <%jackelzxaa> his speech goes on for almost 40 seconds
[2:37:43] <NitronStreams> wow he dumbd
[2:37:44] <SiameseSneeze> YEEEA
[2:37:44] <%walternatorz> the guy in the back is perfect
[2:37:46] <blackjack8182> RENEGADE
[2:37:46] <SilverFaustX> monkaS
[2:37:47] <%aWanderingKaivo> with the uh screams
[2:37:47] <Laecerelius> Gotta love how the other one just walks away
[2:37:47] <%42nfl19> brutal
[2:37:48] <James_Quivers> Funny part i you can let him go for like 6 more lines lol
[2:37:48] <%RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater There's more than a few batarians you run into that are actually totally reasonable and friendly types. Problem is the ones that like doing the slaving - everyone thinks of them first. ME3 does them more favours than this game though.
[2:37:48] <notsoy> yeahhhhhhhh
[2:37:48] <+CyanDeadEye> I love the Phalanx firing sound
[2:37:49] <%Dakuu75> damn
[2:37:49] <NeroInfinite> LUL
[2:37:50] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[2:37:50] <BigFingerRo> WHOAAAAA
[2:37:53] <%dekkitout> Krogans aren't fireproof?
[2:37:54] <californaya> JESUS
[2:37:56] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It gives you multiple chances, you should let him rant
[2:37:56] <mak0t0yukii> EVIL
[2:37:56] <%Varlinator> RENEGADE!!!
[2:37:56] <+senfood> AVENGE ME
[2:37:57] <$Sdeje> Renegade and Paragon lol
[2:37:58] <%NateyBeak> how bout them secondary organs now :>
[2:37:59] <+D00msDayDan> krogan in cutscenes are so goddamn weak
[2:38:00] <TurtlesAndTentacles> TOASTYYYYYY
[2:38:00] <godzookylives> AVENGE ME!!!
[2:38:06] <+TheBitingIrish> TOASTY- goddamnit
[2:38:08] <romc215> SPACE BOOST!
[2:38:10] <%MidnightBurst12> i forgot how bad he gets it
[2:38:11] <%Piemono> I feel like the ME universe bends over backwards to make you not cure the genophage sometimes
[2:38:19] <knight_verse> There's only one rule in the galaxy... YOU DON'T FUCK WITH SHEPARD.
[2:38:26] <%walternatorz> charge on a ramp gets enemies airborne
[2:38:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt btw the Vorcha's behavior is all learned and not inherent. Some Asari tried raising Vorcha and they turned out totally normal
[2:38:33] <nuane> AHHHHHHH
[2:38:33] <$QueequegTheater> GAHHHH
[2:38:34] <%goose_attack_almanac> Why do Vorcha speak like Goblins
[2:38:34] <%GinAndRoses> AHHHHHH
[2:38:34] <peachy996> Oh yeah Vorcha have a similar kind of Blood Rage
[2:38:34] <%logoth_> EYYARRGHH
[2:38:36] <romc215> Sounds like Shepard got a good look at Mordin's face
[2:38:38] <%Taisuru> HE HAS THE GIEF RAGE
[2:38:39] <%NateyBeak> the vorcha are like the kazon in voyager. just bottom of the dumpster dollar store general alien
[2:38:43] <peachy996> Forgot about that
[2:38:43] <$SGrim> @Piemono Krogan numbers would ruin the plot.
[2:38:44] <%OldOnyx> everyone else knowingly backing away after the first shot really makes it
[2:38:53] <%goose_attack_almanac> Did no one bother coding the translator properly for them
[2:38:53] <+CyanDeadEye> Would you have liked a Mass Effect game with an origin system like the first Dragon Age?
[2:38:53] <marcomatame> bald
[2:38:57] <$lumporr> why does pat have a nuke strapped to his back
[2:39:03] <%RubberFistFight> @Piemono Really? Coz it's pretty consistently portrayed as being a bad thing with extremely flimsy justification.
[2:39:04] <californaya> "Man, remember when Shepard killed that guy? That was sick"
[2:39:13] <Dunmarkh> @lumporr battarians
[2:39:13] <%ape_hawk> ha, good one tali
[2:39:15] <mak0t0yukii> LUL
[2:39:15] <$QueequegTheater> Wait, that's it?
[2:39:16] <%ape_hawk> now kiss me
[2:39:17] <knight_verse> @lumporr For big kills
[2:39:20] <%dekkitout> Dassit? Was that the line?
[2:39:21] <%Puffen0> my internet was taking a dump there for a sec lol. looked like some Japanese porn KEKW
[2:39:22] <%aWanderingKaivo> because you stink shepard
[2:39:22] <Jaysky> Uh oh stinky
[2:39:28] <%RetroCop87> I just burped, and it sounded like I said BRUH
[2:39:29] <theshillman> @lumporr for nuking
[2:39:29] <%dd44dostivei> renegade bully the sick guy
[2:39:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah that's the line.
[2:39:32] <%JoshManVGH> Get you a girl who can CHOOSE not to smell your farts!
[2:39:33] <%Daxalog> Olfactory is a word that often appears in scientific contexts (as in "olfactory nerves," the nerves that pass from the nose to the brain and contain the receptors that make smelling possible)
[2:39:35] <captain_kirkhammer> Weyrloc Clanspeaker was Fred Tasciore! Guy does good work.
[2:39:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's what everyone made a big deal about.
[2:39:42] <$QueequegTheater> BULLY THE SICK KROGAN
[2:39:43] <James_Quivers> No, not the line
[2:39:45] <nuane> @lumporr we do a little warcriming
[2:39:45] <+ThunderZebraKing> Mordin is such a great character
[2:39:48] <+CyanDeadEye> No
[2:40:00] <TioXyco> when you work in a hospital, you can understand Tali quite well
[2:40:14] <romc215> Krogans are like roses
[2:40:16] <Jaysky> Gardening huh
[2:40:19] <+NeonLight> Gardening a species, cool cool cool
[2:40:25] <%Varlinator> JEEEZZZZ
[2:40:27] <+Grayhammatter> jesus mordin...
[2:40:30] <Jaysky> "NO NOT MURDERED SHUT UP"
[2:40:31] <+CyanDeadEye> Tali line is the CHARM option
[2:40:32] <Josef_Stryker> Except all those unborn children!
[2:40:36] <SilverFaustX> lol
[2:40:39] <%Varlinator> Farming Equipment! LUL
[2:40:41] <%Puffen0> farming equipment lol
[2:40:41] <%dekkitout> Did- did mordy put folks in woodchippers?
[2:40:42] <blue8moon> do you think showing mordin the piles of dead babies would make him feel bad?
[2:40:48] <%GarbageNirvana> Shepard is pro-life
[2:40:48] <TheAntiNihilist> That Shepard face
[2:40:48] <%mads_valentine> Not children. Dolls.
[2:40:49] <+senfood> I want to hear that farming equipment story.
[2:40:54] <$QueequegTheater> If it was a sterility thing then that argument would hold weight, but the genophage literally creates mountains of dead babies
[2:40:55] <susukouhai> why does mordin sound so excited to talk about this
[2:40:56] <+bassforte123> Didn't Mordin use paralysis toxins on mercinaries when you found him?
[2:40:57] <$Solid_Stro> I want to hear about this farm equipment kill Mordin
[2:40:58] <%AsHeadsIsTails> I really wanna hear the story behind the farming equipment
[2:41:01] <%ainzhelm> Krogan Hiroshima logic
[2:41:04] <Vikingincognito> "I only did like 90% of a genocide"
[2:41:06] <californaya> "See, I'm good because I didn't genocide them!"
[2:41:10] <romc215> All life precious then proceeds to slaughter his way though the Krogan base killing anything that moves
[2:41:14] <%mads_valentine> Babies without nervous system.
[2:41:17] <peachy996> It's in the Shadow Broker intel
[2:41:18] <+NeonLight> "What was it like doing war craimes?" "Best years of my life."
[2:41:18] <holyxgrale> He actually just put a giant condom on the krogans
[2:41:19] <+TheBitingIrish> It sounds like they really never had a handle on what they were doing.
[2:41:20] <%RubberFistFight> @Josef_Stryker I mean if that's the criteria for being a "mass murderer" then uh...
[2:41:21] <Dunmarkh> Very fun genocide
[2:41:22] <%goose_attack_almanac> 2 hours
[2:41:26] <knight_verse> @bassforte123 No, he use a gun and mechs
[2:41:28] <James_Quivers> 1 hour is all they need
[2:41:30] <captain_kirkhammer> They only sleep an hour a day actually
[2:41:30] <%Daxalog> That sounds tight.
[2:41:33] <%Puffen0> maybe
[2:41:33] <%dekkitout> Sounds about right for their lifespan
[2:41:36] <%Puffen0> idk
[2:41:37] <Vikingincognito> BTW: forced sterilization IS part of the definition of genocide
[2:41:38] <+TheBitingIrish> Oh wow
[2:41:44] <stantheman_97> 2 to 4 hours iirc
[2:41:48] <pilllowofbees> man i love mordin LUL
[2:41:49] <%rekinom> They're too high strung to sleep any longer
[2:41:56] <%jackelzxaa> they do such a good job of writing something so difficult with mordin
[2:41:59] <Josef_Stryker> @RubberFistFight There's a difference between what you're likely referring to and all those stillborn.
[2:42:01] <%bassoontyphoon> “Eat, Pray, Alter the Fertility Rates of an Entire Species”
[2:42:06] <James_Quivers> MORDIN IS SO GOD DAMN INTERESTING HOLY SHIT
[2:42:07] <$SGrim> Guilt is NOT ENOUGH
[2:42:10] <%Varlinator> Humans live fast compared to Asari/Krogan, but Salarians live FAST comapared to us
[2:42:14] <%Puffen0> @Vikingincognito thats the human definition, not the selarian definition lol
[2:42:17] <romc215> That's what drugs are for, to get a good night's sleep, or stay up for days
[2:42:21] <%daemonazaezal> this dude is so in denial about all of his psuedo genocide
[2:42:23] <+ThunderZebraKing> Mordin has the most depth of all the characters.
[2:42:25] <Jaysky> His morality is interesting
[2:42:26] <%shadowsofpain> hard to sleep? that's guilt that's a bad thing mordin
[2:42:36] <%GalacticaPhanto> GalacticaPhanto subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! Is Pat Shepard a Shoto? he does throw fireballs
[2:42:41] <%ElkRiverDog> What’s he inhaling through?
[2:42:41] <$Solid_Stro> It’s not enough to feel guilt Mordin
[2:42:45] <%RubberFistFight> @Vikingincognito Except that it's not sterelisation. Nobody's sterile, the genophage just makes it way more likely that the fetus will experience a critical neurological defect in development and never become viable. "Sterile" has a distinct definition that doesn't fit here.
[2:42:50] <%justcallmebobplease> It's like he HAS to tell himself that, to not fall apart
[2:42:50] <%ape_hawk> good way to justify it, dood
[2:42:50] <+unhuggable1> coping
[2:42:53] <%daemonazaezal> He really wants to believe it was needed
[2:42:54] <%shadowsofpain> hard denial
[2:42:54] <intestinal_bleeding> pontious mordin
[2:42:56] <Sp3ctre48> Like in a way he is right, the genophage was necessary at the time, but the Salarian's don't see how this issue effects the Krogan psychologically
[2:42:57] <$lumporr> "i just fucked their society i didn't put the gun in their mouth"
[2:42:57] <%tinyswampthing> salarians are a race where everyone has adhd, maybe thats why i like them so much
[2:42:58] <penitentpendant> "Out Out DAMN SPOT!"
[2:42:58] <$realm_forge> Mordin is an incredibly well written mad scientist
[2:43:00] <%tank7013> He's inventing more koolaid to drink on the fly
[2:43:01] <%Monkeyweed21> HE IS ON COPIUM
[2:43:01] <holyxgrale> Krogans woulda been awesome if they nuked the world
[2:43:03] <%Torus1025> OUT DAMN SPOT
[2:43:05] <jorniev> he has some points but it's so fucked
[2:43:09] <TurtlesAndTentacles> This is why he's ass
[2:43:10] <Dunmarkh> OH THEY DID, DID THEY?
[2:43:10] <Jaysky> @shadowsofpain Was worth it. Had to do it. Had to be him.
[2:43:11] <%bassoontyphoon> Wow Tuchanka has a lot of copium
[2:43:14] <akitanito> coping hard
[2:43:19] <%dekkitout> Dunno Mordy, you prolly have the biggest killstreak in the Krogan books
[2:43:21] <+unhuggable1> suuure
[2:43:23] <stantheman_97> he's trying his hardest to remove the doubts and guilt from his mind. it's not working
[2:43:26] <%whyskeywolfe> This is also the US's rationale for nuking Japan.
[2:43:27] <%ape_hawk> to be fair, krogans WERE launching asteroids at colonized planets
[2:43:31] <+ThomasOfTroy> You'd have to get them all there first Pat
[2:43:33] <+CyanDeadEye> Turians don't think like that though
[2:43:34] <%brisk_dacat> With what guns
[2:43:34] <%daemonazaezal> blockade the homeworld
[2:43:35] <%AncelDeLambert> that would have been WAY worse
[2:43:36] <captain_kirkhammer> Forced relocation is also genocide Pat
[2:43:36] <akitanito> like a planetary shield from stellaris
[2:43:36] <%jackelzxaa> how would you put them all back on tuchunka pat
[2:43:38] <%ape_hawk> but still
[2:43:38] <%kujofire990> That still woundn't work
[2:43:38] <%daemonazaezal> with turian ships
[2:43:40] <romc215> Unless the Krogan fired at the ships from the surface with missiles or really big guns
[2:43:40] <%polothegreatest> just invent condons
[2:43:40] <%aWanderingKaivo> it would still be bad, tuchanka would be crazy overpopulated then
[2:43:41] <%RubberFistFight> Doctor Who had a line that completely encapsulates this situation: "Sometimes all you have are bad decisions but someone still has to make them."
[2:43:42] <%shadowsofpain> @jaysky Someone else might have...
[2:43:42] <Zalapski> Jesus christ guys, he spends the entire third game trying to make up for his mistakes, he's actually one of the only characters who changes
[2:43:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Mordin has to pretend he didn't do a big monstrous act or else he can't sleep.
[2:43:46] <%SveriSageAdvice> launching ASTEROIDS?
[2:43:47] <$Solid_Stro> Lock them on the planet like the Yahgs
[2:43:48] <holyxgrale> That woulda killed way more probably
[2:43:52] <NeroInfinite> That wouldn't work Pat.
[2:43:54] <peachy996> They could have not made the genophage affect birthes so hard that you only get 1 kid if you're lucky
[2:43:54] <%jackelzxaa> tuchunka were over-breeding and already a galactic species by that point
[2:43:56] <%StaceMcGate> Krogan destroyed 3 planets, and killed millions
[2:43:59] <%jackelzxaa> *krogan
[2:44:02] <James_Quivers> Krogan were also stealing other races tech AND enslaving their engineers tho, liek that one mechanic said
[2:44:04] <wolverinewaswrong> Krogan did try to genocide the Turians though
[2:44:04] <%StaceMcGate> They would've committed higher levels of genocide
[2:44:05] <+Ches_Neckbeard> the Krogan rebellions kicked off when they invaded an Asari colony. they already had ships
[2:44:08] <%Varlinator> YOU WENT TOO FAR U FUCK!
[2:44:09] <%Puffen0> they know how to make space crafts now pat. just not when they were first discovered
[2:44:12] <+Mr_Misanthropy> but there would still be resistance and a culling of that resistance.
[2:44:12] <%RubberFistFight> @Zalapski You expect these people to understand that level of nuance? LUL
[2:44:15] <%jackelzxaa> krogans were like batarians on crack
[2:44:16] <daemonazaezal> It isnt that he changes as much as in this game you see his hard denial\
[2:44:16] <knight_verse> The Krogan nuked themselves BEFORE the Salarians uplifted them though.
[2:44:17] <+leontalon> This is an allegory for the US/JP conflict, the loses in pushing all the krogan to tuchanka would have been catastrophic
[2:44:17] <+Peacefrog7> this is my fav loyalty mission btw
[2:44:18] <%Puhff> For claiming to like Mordin, you sure do shit on his choices a bunch.
[2:44:21] <%AncelDeLambert> feeling helpless is nowhere NEAR the kind of psychological burden that feeling stircrazy is
[2:44:22] <%FriedMattato> HOW would they have forced the Krogan back on Tuchanka? Mordin says they couldn't risk conventional war @PatStaresAt
[2:44:22] <iosephe> oh the Homeworld solution? How did that work out?
[2:44:22] <captain_kirkhammer> Oh eayh that's right, the Krogan committed like three ecocides
[2:44:25] <peachy996> here we go
[2:44:29] <GuilKato> says the man who has never seen a security camera
[2:44:31] <Sp3ctre48> The Krogan population without the genophage explodes too much to keep them all confined on their planet, it's not feasible
[2:44:34] <californaya> I find the story of ME pretty neat but man, do I hate playing it.
[2:44:34] <stantheman_97> but also if the genophage didn't happen everyone but the krogan would be genocided instead
[2:44:36] <%GalacticaPhanto> @zalapski Mordin is legit the best character development wise but he still has to be called out on his bullshit
[2:44:38] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Pat the krogan were literally doing colony drops
[2:44:44] <Zalapski> @rubberfistfight true. futile
[2:44:44] <Jaysky> @shadowsofpain ...gotten it wrong. catmechCri
[2:44:46] <romc215> No such thing as a pointless waste of life because life itself is pointless
[2:44:49] <Josef_Stryker> @Puhff Mordin is great because of how actually morally grey he is
[2:44:52] <%tinyswampthing> the story doesnt go over th rebellions that well they did some awful shit in such a short amount of time
[2:44:55] <+crimson_echidna> @wolverinewaswrong Yeah that's kind of the elephant in the room that people don't like to acknowledge. Krogan essentially were attempting to nuke the Turian homeworld first.
[2:44:56] <%RubberFistFight> @Sp3ctre48 "nO bUt tHe deAd BaBieS tHo"
[2:44:58] <T_Sasquatch> Oh boy just intime for this
[2:45:01] <%ape_hawk> also, wrex DOES agree with mordin, to a point. Wrex mentions that the genophage wasnt killing the krogans; the krogans were killing the krogans
[2:45:02] <%jackelzxaa> i like that mordin is at least honest in every word he says
[2:45:04] <+Peacefrog7> hate to see it
[2:45:04] <TurtlesAndTentacles> YOU DID THIS
[2:45:05] <$lumporr> yo imagine if the krogans won and took over the galaxy. they'd kick the reapers' asses
[2:45:14] <T_Sasquatch> Mordin did nothing wrong
[2:45:16] <%jackelzxaa> he is never knowingly deceptive, but his reasoning is doing all the heavy lifting
[2:45:23] <knight_verse> @turtlesandtentacles He literally didn't.
[2:45:29] <RetributionP> the only bad thing about the gynophaghe is just the still born baby's if it was just rescued birthrate it morden could defend this
[2:45:30] <%shadowsofpain> @jaysky excited to see pats reaction
[2:45:31] <%AncelDeLambert> the reapers would have drunk the krogans like a milkshake if they'd won
[2:45:33] <$realm_forge> Mordin’s voice actor does an amazing job
[2:45:34] <%Varlinator> Someone else might've gotten it wrong
[2:45:43] <Vikingincognito> The council could have simply surrendered
[2:45:45] <%RubberFistFight> @Josef_Stryker He's a fantastic example of true moral greyness, not just the "s/he's evil but s/he's also hot" type.
[2:45:47] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Mordin did it all wrong. I feel nothing for him
[2:45:50] <Sp3ctre48> @Sp3ctre48 tbf the dead babies really harm the Krogan psychologically, Wrex is right that the genophage isn't killing the Krogan, but it is causing them to act in self destructive ways
[2:45:51] <%bassoontyphoon> If copium was a mine able resource Shepard would have infinite money at this pont
[2:45:51] <SaltyAzteca> He's torn
[2:45:53] <jorniev> MORDIN did some things wrong
[2:45:58] <Vikingincognito> I would rather my governemnt surrender than commit genocied
[2:46:01] <%jackelzxaa> mordin's me3 stuff is some of the best in the game pre-dlc
[2:46:02] <+crimson_echidna> ME3 Citadel DLC eventually reveals that the Genophage wasn't some clear cut agreement that Mordin made it out to be.
[2:46:08] <Jaysky> @shadowsofpain I'd hope he hasn't been spoiled on it as it's a bit I feel is easy to see or overhear people talk about
[2:46:17] <T_Sasquatch> He did NOTHING wrong aiyanyNotlikethiss aiyanyBonk
[2:46:24] <californaya> "Ethically difficult"
[2:46:28] <romc215> The pile of corpses IS the big picture
[2:46:31] <%AncelDeLambert> he... JUST did, Shepard
[2:46:33] <%shadowsofpain> @jaysky Let's hope
[2:46:34] <stormhawk9891> THAT'S A FUCKING GOOD LINE
[2:46:35] <holyxgrale> Thank god wrex is alive
[2:46:35] <@commanderclaw> "Hey man, all I did was involuntary abortions en masse, it's fine bro"
[2:46:46] <Zalapski> seriously though, mordin yelling "I made a mistake!" and then composing himself is maybe the best line read in the series
[2:46:47] <$lumporr> THE WHEEL OF LIFE, Y'KNOW, THE ONE YOU DENIED TO MILLIONS OF KROGANS
[2:46:49] <%jackelzxaa> that's a good religion for a short lived species to adapt
[2:46:51] <%jackelzxaa> it makes alot of sense
[2:46:51] <%Varlinator> He's slowed right down in this scene. Nice detail
[2:46:56] <Sp3ctre48> Was either a pile of corpes or the Krogan exterminating the Turians, there was no good choice for them
[2:46:59] <+D00msDayDan> i wonder if they talked with anyone that worked on the manhattan project
[2:46:59] <%athuramn> that is not how Hinduism works lol
[2:47:04] <Josef_Stryker> Great. Talk about the corpse.
[2:47:09] <%athuramn> that is offensive
[2:47:10] <RDknight> this looks like mcoy talking to spock
[2:47:11] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Notice that he's talking much slower
[2:47:11] <Vikingincognito> The diolauge in this mission is fantastic
[2:47:12] <ioci2112> @Sp3ctre48 the thing is that is the salarian's fault to begin with, they uplifted the krogan because they needed them against the rachni, and the krogans were clearly not ready to join the galactic stage, the krogans would have probably evolved culturally or biologically sooner or later, but the salarians saw them as a weapon, and treated them as such
[2:47:13] <T_Sasquatch> @jackelzxaa yea fuck em LUL
[2:47:14] <%aWanderingKaivo> he said similar, not exactly
[2:47:26] <Dunmarkh> Why couldn't he just make the sperm shittier instead of making the dead baby piles
[2:47:28] <%AncelDeLambert> "How could you force the abortions of these face eating leopards?!"
[2:47:34] <Tracazoid> "As we all know, always trust the simulations."
[2:47:43] <%RubberFistFight> @Sp3ctre48 It's worth noting that multiple people from multiple races INCLUDING at least one krogan say "the genophage was a completely awful thing but at the same time it was absolutely the best decision at the time". People in here are acting like there was some perfect, "everybody hugs and sings kumbaya" solution that they just didn't take out of laziness or mustache-twirling villainy.
[2:47:43] <%AncelDeLambert> they'd have rejoiced... and went back to conquest
[2:47:48] <%shadowsofpain> love how he slows down here
[2:47:51] <$Solid_Stro> You uplifted the Krogan just make them war machines
[2:47:58] <%GalacticaPhanto> Has there been a character on the level of Mordin's character growth and redemption
[2:48:00] <%daemonazaezal> DOESNT WREX SIT ON A BLOOD THRONE NOW?
[2:48:03] <%athuramn> then he could call it religion, because similar reduces that bar to nothing lol
[2:48:03] <Sp3ctre48> @Sp3ctre48 I mean obviously yeah, uplifting the Krogan was a bad thing to do, but the Salarians were also in an existential conflict with the Rachni at the time, they really didn't have a choice
[2:48:05] <T_Sasquatch> Yes
[2:48:08] <iosephe> they could also reduce the aggression of the Krogan
[2:48:08] <%daemonazaezal> He won it via conquest
[2:48:09] <%GalacticaPhanto> *?
[2:48:10] <+senfood> "DUH, BRO"
[2:48:11] <peachy996> He's kinda right....if you pick Wreav
[2:48:14] <akitanito> probably killed more krogans from sterilization than actually just wiping out the species
[2:48:22] <%bread_assassin> This never woulda happened if the Turians joined the galactic community earlier. They totally coulda took on the Rachni.
[2:48:24] <+ThunderZebraKing> Better idea: genetically alter them to correct hyperaggressive behavior
[2:48:27] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt He's talking about his work, not the original
[2:48:27] <%Puffen0> He's kinda right....if you pick Wreav
[2:48:29] <peachy996> That's why you never kill Wrex
[2:48:31] <$lumporr> get fucked
[2:48:32] <%jackelzxaa> humans have the 4th strongest military
[2:48:32] <captain_kirkhammer> We punch way above our weight, we're space Japan
[2:48:36] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, have you seen what humans have been doing since we got on the scene?
[2:48:36] <T_Sasquatch> Bigger picture
[2:48:37] <%Torus1025> Oof
[2:48:38] <wolverinewaswrong> Yo did the reapers technically cause this since they controlled the rachni?
[2:48:39] <TurtlesAndTentacles> YOU TELL HIM SHEPARD
[2:48:41] <%ape_hawk> humans ARE great at war, dude
[2:48:41] <iosephe> The genophage change would be within that 40 years
[2:48:46] <Goatllama> get outta here with your self-righteousness shep shep
[2:48:48] <%bassoontyphoon> psaDab
[2:48:49] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt he's saying his excuses don't matter.
[2:48:49] <%jackelzxaa> mordin's genophage was about 7 years after first contact war
[2:48:49] <stantheman_97> yeah he did it when humans were around. remember he's like 36 or something
[2:48:51] <+RyanTheRecluse> probably means that salaries are still discussing the genophage
[2:48:51] <%RetroCop87> GOD, I FUCKING LOVE MORDIN'S ARC
[2:48:53] <%dekkitout> @ThunderZebraKing That's a different flavor of fucked up
[2:48:55] <knight_verse> It was either neuter them or let the Turians and Humans cause their extinction.
[2:48:59] <%Monkeyweed21> he is coping so hard
[2:48:59] <holyxgrale> DESTROY HIS EGO
[2:49:01] <xcompleasedad> @wolverinewaswrong Yes
[2:49:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Mordin updated the genophage between ME1 and 2. Humans totally would've joined the fight.
[2:49:02] <$SGrim> Sure thing Mengele
[2:49:07] <jorniev> no he said that what he thought doesn't matter
[2:49:08] <%jackelzxaa> humans and turians uniting against a surging krogan population would have been actually likely
[2:49:08] <Sp3ctre48> @wolverinewaswrong Yeah, I don't really like that retcon but it is the explanation for why the Rachni acted that way
[2:49:09] <%strugglepunk2> @PatStaresAt Mordin is saying that his justifications don't matter, not that the dead woman doesnt matter
[2:49:13] <$Solid_Stro> Love you Mordin, you’re wrong, but I love you
[2:49:15] <peachy996> This is why Wrex and Eve are so vital to curing the genophage imo
[2:49:21] <%shadowsofpain> He's super trying to rationalize it, he knows it's wrong but sees it as a lesser of 2 evils
[2:49:22] <James_Quivers> @Puffen0 That's the brilliant part about all this, how right or wrong Mordin can be is totally dependant on the impact you leave on the Krogan throughout the games
[2:49:27] <%jackelzxaa> especially because it would be a way to unite palaven and earth politics post-war
[2:49:29] <+ThunderZebraKing> @dekkitout I mean yeah, but better than forced sterility.
[2:49:29] <%polothegreatest> But what IF tho
[2:49:32] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Bring paige on lol
[2:49:34] <%chiluzza> wait a moment PAIGE CAN RUN
[2:49:34] <theshillman> IRL DOGSTREAM YOU COWARD
[2:49:36] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt that's the moment where he truly internalises just how fucked up the genophage actually was. YES it was necessary due to the total absence of any other better options, but it was still totally fucked, and that's where he reconciles that.
[2:49:37] <%Monkeyweed21> he is right considering the Planet Destroying bomb they planted on Tuchanka
[2:49:42] <T_Sasquatch> Chat. Let's imagine a world without the genophage. Do you really think krogans wouldn't have wrecked the galaxy
[2:49:42] <%jackelzxaa> at least his rationalization isn't complete bullshit
[2:49:42] <captain_kirkhammer> @shadowsofpain If neither survive in 3 you can get Mordin to agree to not curing the genophage
[2:49:44] <%bassoontyphoon> sipsipGasm
[2:49:44] <%skeleklng> is the stream laggy or is it just me?
[2:49:45] <theshillman> TAKE CHAT ALONG FOR WALKIES
[2:49:46] <RetributionP> shit this isn't youtube I can't fastfoward
[2:49:49] <%jackelzxaa> it's like...you can actually see those things happening
[2:49:50] <knight_verse> Technically, if the Turians uplifted the humans and teamed up they would have been the ultimate team up in the war against the Krogan.
[2:49:55] <peachy996> Vital in the sense that you want those two around to lead the Krogan should you cure them in 3
[2:49:55] <%jackelzxaa> yes
[2:49:59] <Sp3ctre48> I mean like to me, the genophage is an awful thing, but there it was necessary at the time
[2:50:03] <+Peacefrog7> this mission reminds me of a star trek episode all the ethics and morality discussion
[2:50:03] <%jackelzxaa> wrex was so fed up with the krogans he LEFT
[2:50:12] <%Puffen0> you find a datafile in me3 Citadel dlc that shows WHO exactly made the choice to drop the genophage on the krogan
[2:50:13] <Dunmarkh> @T_Sasquatch simulations say the humans and turians would kill their asses
[2:50:13] <$lumporr> @T_Sasquatch they woulda taken over and we'd have a galactic military junta where the krogans formed the council it'd be so lit
[2:50:17] <%RubberFistFight> @knight_verse The humans didn't need "uplifting" though.
[2:50:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @knight_verse At that time it would've been like the 1600s tho.
[2:50:17] <+ThomasOfTroy> @skeleklng I'm not having issues
[2:50:17] <%daemonazaezal> The krogans would have either been dominant or secured human turerian aliance at the top with the krogan genocide
[2:50:18] <Josef_Stryker> I love Mordin's outburst in ME3 if you choose to withhold the Dalatrass information from Wrex. Just shouts "I MADE A MISTAKE" like all that guilt was finally ready to burst out of him
[2:50:21] <+Peacefrog7> @Sp3ctre48 its tricky
[2:50:27] <flexwing_> ask yourselves, WWJD?
[2:50:30] <Sp3ctre48> The Krogan were literally dropping asteroids on the Turian homeworld, it was that or let them all die
[2:50:31] <RetributionP> they just made the gynophaghe shitty
[2:50:34] <%StaceMcGate> The Krogan were butchering planets and colonies before the Genophage. The only other option to force planet would've been to annihilate whole planets
[2:50:36] <Dunmarkh> waynerPiss waynerPiss waynerPiss waynerPiss waynerPiss waynerPiss waynerPiss waynerPiss waynerPiss waynerPiss waynerPiss waynerPiss
[2:50:38] <%Monkeyweed21> Mordin is right about 1 thing, considering the Turians planted a planet destroying bomb on Tuchanka
[2:50:38] <DSD24> Shepard made Wrex realize he couldn't do just leave the Krogan behind
[2:50:45] <%jackelzxaa> it's only due to recent advancements with clan urdnot that a peaceful galactic krogan society is even an option
[2:50:52] <%aWanderingKaivo> What would Javik do? Toss them all out de airlock.
[2:50:52] <%ItalianWaifu> @T_Sasquatch not the whole galaxy there would probably be a sector of it that was just under constant war, with a few small clans leaking out that the rest of the galaxy would wipe out
[2:50:53] <+Peacefrog7> @Sp3ctre48 have you played me3
[2:50:55] <%tinyswampthing> the krogan would have wiped every other speices easily
[2:50:56] <peachy996> Yeah the Citadel Archives have neat little insights into the backstory
[2:51:01] <Josef_Stryker> The Salarians made the first mistake by uplifting the Krogan way too early than they would've done on their own.
[2:51:05] <%jackelzxaa> also keep in mind that krogans eat the other races at times
[2:51:06] <knight_verse> @t_sasquatch They did kill their own planet with them on it.
[2:51:11] <%shadowsofpain> @captain_kirkhammer yeah cus he rationalized that a future with a wrex at the wheel would have worked but not a typical Krogan
[2:51:14] <%Dakuu75> were the krogen actualy so strong that they could take over the galaxy? liek was there tech good nuff?
[2:51:15] <Josef_Stryker> Like he said, it was like giving cavemen nuclear weapons
[2:51:16] <%athuramn> right, the genophage was because they were dangerous and a threat, completely unlike that human race that sent ships into space with the destructive power to destroy several planets
[2:51:21] <Sp3ctre48> In an ideal world the Turians and Salarians could work with the Krogan to enact some kind of population control, but there's too much bad blood for that until after ME3
[2:51:29] <%GarbageNirvana> Really the salarians were in the wrong from moment one
[2:51:31] <%aWanderingKaivo> @jackelzxaa What? where is did you see that?
[2:51:31] <%StaceMcGate> Salarians are to blame for like 2/3 of the galactic crises in this series lol
[2:51:34] <+Peacefrog7> @peachy996 thats what i was gonna say it ends up being an expansion issue
[2:51:35] <%aWanderingKaivo> where did*
[2:51:39] <Sp3ctre48> @Peacefrog7 Yes?
[2:51:40] <ioci2112> the krogan would probably fight each other way before they conquered the whole galaxy, wether that would be good or bad for everyone else is a different matter entirely
[2:51:42] <+Peacefrog7> ended*
[2:51:48] <%jackelzxaa> in me3 wrex talks about eating salarian liver
[2:51:51] <$lumporr> i want the krogan fight galaxy! fight forever! 👏👏 👏👏👏
[2:51:51] <%RubberFistFight> @Josef_Stryker That wasn't the guilt of making the genophage though, since that happened long before he was born. The guilt was of modifying it to continue its effectiveness. Also, it's possible to make the "right decision" and have it be a bad one if ALL the decisions available are bad. They call that "choosing the lesser evil". Doing NOTHING is also a choice and is frequently worse than picking a "bad" option. This is essentially a more nuanced version of the Trolley Problem.
[2:51:52] <susukouhai> p
[2:51:54] <fullyradical> What human ships?
[2:51:54] <T_Sasquatch> Ofcourse the genophage is a fucked up thing. There's no argument there but based on the info given i would've done the same thing
[2:51:56] <Byronic_dreamer> !uptime
[2:51:56] <@Moobot> @Byronic_dreamer I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 52m.
[2:51:57] <Josef_Stryker> The Krogan are apex predators compared to all other races with their regenerative abilities, redundant nervous systems and their ability to breed to quickly
[2:51:58] <susukouhai> 0
[2:51:59] <%Monkeyweed21> @Sp3ctre48 weren't the Krogan rebellions caused because everyone treated the Krogan like attack dogs against the Rachni then just kinda left them to rot instead of helping them form a stable society
[2:51:59] <James_Quivers> Two points that are baseline regardless of however you treat the Krogan in the games: 1. That Salarians uplifted them in the first place, meaning they're regardless responsible for the state of their culture, and 2. Mordin relies on the status of the Krogan from centuries previous for jsutification rather than how they are right now.
[2:52:06] <NeroInfinite> What human ships ?
[2:52:08] <%GarbageNirvana> Just one big race of galactic fuckup salamanders
[2:52:09] <$TrashManJonesy> pooooop
[2:52:09] <%aWanderingKaivo> huh. weird
[2:52:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @aWanderingKaivo Wrex talks about it a lot. But I think Wrex is also joking when he says that stuff.
[2:52:13] <peachy996> The only strength in ME3's writing and choices lie on Tuchanka. People still debate it to this day which is impressive
[2:52:38] <$lumporr> fight forever 👏 👏 👏👏👏
[2:52:43] <%jackelzxaa> me3 has alot of good writing in the squad and crew interactions too
[2:52:46] <%GarbageNirvana> ME3's writing was just...massively disappointing
[2:52:51] <%StaceMcGate> yeah Genophage is a great writing tool. There is no simple answer in debating its ethical implemency
[2:52:56] <%RubberFistFight> Part of the reason people debate it is because some people are incapable of accepting that sometimes "good decisions" don't exist.
[2:52:57] <%jackelzxaa> anything involving talking to garrus is solid gold
[2:52:57] <peachy996> There are two outcomes with different variable that make either outcome better or worse
[2:52:58] <knight_verse> @too_much_nukie And at the time we were already really good at killing.
[2:53:00] <DSD24> ME 3 has the best gameplay
[2:53:00] <%aWanderingKaivo> the duality of man
[2:53:01] <Sp3ctre48> @Monkeyweed21 No, the Krogan rebellions were caused by the Krogan population not being sustainable even with all the planets the council gave them. The Krogan kept demanding war, and when they said no, the Krogan invaded everyone
[2:53:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I really disagree and think ME3 has many other strong points in its writing. The ending shits the bed but it has many good moments.
[2:53:16] <Josef_Stryker> @RubberFistFight Yeah I meant to say genophage modifications. Regardless it's clear that Mordin truly did feel horribly guilty of his actions but had to constantly justify them with facts and data.
[2:53:21] <peachy996> Not with Cerberus Nukie
[2:53:22] <Sp3ctre48> *Kept demanding more, sorry
[2:53:27] <peachy996> I don't like Rannoch either
[2:53:34] <%StaceMcGate> problem is that ending soured everything about the series for me, just like GOT S 7/8
[2:53:38] <peachy996> The synthetic vs ai stuff is bollocks imo
[2:53:38] <+ThunderZebraKing> Yeah without genophage the krogans bred like rabbits, nine foot tall blood raged unkillable rabbits.
[2:53:40] <James_Quivers> ME3 handled the end of the Krogan and Quarian storylines really well, I think
[2:53:44] <Josef_Stryker> And he doesn't bring up valid points.
[2:53:46] <%jackelzxaa> even in me3 if wreve runs clan urdnot that opens up "This might actually be a serious mistake" options because he's showing signs of tyranny and impericism
[2:53:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Mordin felt so guilty because of his work on the genophage that he quit STG and had a crisis of faith.
[2:53:48] <peachy996> The fucking Citadel coup is all kinds of moron
[2:53:50] <%shadowsofpain> @peachy996 I'd argue them, the Quarian homeworld and the Asari one. those 3 places are great from a writing standpoint
[2:53:52] <T_Sasquatch> I totally wiped out the rachni in me1. Not letting that shit ruin the world again
[2:53:58] <+Peacefrog7> @Monkeyweed21 i thought it was more like they asked for more planets and the council denied them until the krogan rebelled
[2:54:03] <Sp3ctre48> Eh. I really don't like the Quarian conflict in ME3
[2:54:23] <$QueequegTheater> @T_Sasquatch They don't though, they were indoctrinated. Not their fault
[2:54:23] <+ThunderZebraKing> @T_Sasquatch They didn't, the reapers were corrupting the first batch to start the rachni wars.
[2:54:26] <%GarbageNirvana> ME3 didn't let me shoot the kid at the beginning
[2:54:26] <+ThomasOfTroy> @Monkeyweed21 This is correct
[2:54:29] <Josef_Stryker> Yeah if Wreav is in charge and Eve isn't there to keep him in check, sabotaging the cure is the best option in the long run/
[2:54:31] <peachy996> Tuchanka conflict is the only time the writing in 3 shines imo.
[2:54:31] <RetributionP> mordins right 100% but he just should of made a gynophaghe that didn't cause still birth. it's easily that simple
[2:54:39] <%RubberFistFight> @Josef_Stryker What's great about it is despite him knowing that literally all the data both present and extrapolated was completely on his side, it was still a morally distasteful decision. They refer to things like that as "cold equations". You have to totally excise morality and make the decision based solely on the data otherwise disaster. Like the trolley problem, or what happens in the movie Sunshine.
[2:54:42] <%jackelzxaa> what's crazy about the rannoch shit is the bad ending to that questline actually does significantly change how you view geth reasoning, but most people wouldn't see that outcome
[2:54:46] <knight_verse> @t_sasquatch then you wasted a lot of points
[2:54:54] <+Peacefrog7> remember not to spoil 3 for pat guys
[2:54:56] <%jackelzxaa> what do you mean doens't cause still birth
[2:54:58] <%jackelzxaa> that's not simple
[2:55:00] <T_Sasquatch> @queequegtheater acid spitting murder insects don't get to live aiyanyBonk
[2:55:00] <jorniev> speaking of weaponizing viruses guess what country was apparently experimenting with that?
[2:55:04] <%Monkeyweed21> @Peacefrog7 yea the Council has really big problems with species "going too fast for their own good" i.e. Humans wanting a seat on the Council
[2:55:05] <%jackelzxaa> the genophage causes only some of the births to work
[2:55:06] <%StaceMcGate> if there is a species to feel bad for, its the Vorcha. Essentially born evil and abused by every other species
[2:55:11] <%aWanderingKaivo> @Too_Much_Nukie Yeah, I feel like he just doesn't admit his guilt till mE3 due in part to pride actually. Pride in his work as a scientist, the accuracy of his simulations, etc
[2:55:15] <%athuramn> it's as if the salarians are similar to religious and political groups that have actively caused the destruction of societies and suppression of other groups for belief that they might be hard to control 🤔
[2:55:17] <peachy996> And considering the first time you saw gameplay of 3 it involved the Krogan cure it had to be the first thing they wrote and gave proper time to
[2:55:17] <+ThunderZebraKing> The rachni are actually super nice and shy, they just got all reapered the first time
[2:55:19] <Sp3ctre48> @RetributionP I mean, if it was that easy they probably would have done it
[2:55:20] <Josef_Stryker> Perhaps the genophage being the way it was was to break the Krogan's spirit
[2:55:20] <%shadowsofpain> @sp3ctre48 Happens it had to end someway and either having to pick a side or find peace makes sense
[2:55:22] <TheFramedWarlock> Where did Pat go ?
[2:55:28] <$QueequegTheater> @T_Sasquatch Bruh humans exhale poison and our saliva is acidic
[2:55:37] <T_Sasquatch> @knight_verse you think i cared about that shitty green ending in me3
[2:55:38] <%aWanderingKaivo> Pat is BRB
[2:55:39] <%jackelzxaa> pats walking the fat man
[2:55:45] <ioci2112> I still think me3 pushes you way too hard to cure the genophage, even if curing it makes sense since you need the krogan and a galaxy dominated by krogan in a 100 years beats the reapers killing everyone right now
[2:55:46] <+Peacefrog7> @Monkeyweed21 yeah so it makes the genophage look even worse in hindsight
[2:55:55] <NeroInfinite> @StaceMcGate they aren't born evil, but they are the most easy to corrupt.
[2:56:00] <T_Sasquatch> @queequegtheater aiyanyBonk insect sympathizer
[2:56:01] <leinadtonu> Did Pat finally poop his pants?
[2:56:02] <knight_verse> The reason the Rachin wars happened in the first place was because of the reapers indoctrinating the original Rachni.
[2:56:05] <$QueequegTheater> @jackelzxaa but what about Zangief Kappa
[2:56:05] <Josef_Stryker> I bet Mordin would love human philosophy as a subject.
[2:56:07] <%StaceMcGate> also, I refuse to believe Humans would be the most genetically diversified species in the galaxy
[2:56:10] <%RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater We require a potent oxidiser to live as well, lol.
[2:56:16] <%jackelzxaa> me3 pushes happy endings a little too much and doesn't live in the ethical problems, which is why the ending fell flat for everyone
[2:56:17] <Josef_Stryker> Now I'm just imagining him taking lessons from Chidi in the Good Place
[2:56:26] <James_Quivers> The Geth vs Quarian conflict was never as complex as the Genophage stuff so I have no issue with it being a simpler outcome, still enjoy all the chocies that feed into it and how you need to have done A LOT correctly in order to get the best outcome. Make it feel like you had to have fully committed to peace from the beginning
[2:56:27] <knight_verse> Basically, the Reapers were already starting to invade at that time.
[2:56:27] <%jackelzxaa> rannoch should have reinforced the ending but they fucked up
[2:56:29] <$QueequegTheater> @T_Sasquatch YOU LEAVE THEM ALONE, THEY'RE GOOD BOYS AND GIRLS
[2:56:35] <%StaceMcGate> @StaceMcGate Vorcha have to inflict wounds on one another to physically mature. That's...a bit rough
[2:56:41] <%Nyanlathotep> @StaceMcGate I think the implication is that they're diverse within their species.
[2:56:42] <%GarbageNirvana> I went with the blue ending for my renegade Shep but only because making her the Reaper hive mind meant she was the most powerful being in the galaxy
[2:56:46] <%aWanderingKaivo> @StaceMcGate one would think asari should be pretty high up there
[2:56:46] <peachy996> I think curing the genophage lies solely on if you have wrex and eve. If you have Wreav fuckit
[2:56:47] <Sp3ctre48> @shadowsofpain This about the Quarians? I don't mind the resolution there, I really hate how the game goes too far to make the Geth completely in the right and victims of the Quarians being morons for two games straight, there's literally no choice to make there
[2:57:03] <%Monkeyweed21> @Peacefrog7 there was a solution in letting the Krogan colonize the Terminus systems in exchange for enacting population control measures, but neither the Council nor the Krogans at the time would go for that
[2:57:05] <%jackelzxaa> the geth are willing to take an absolutist solution towards physical threat, and if you've seen all 3 endings of rannoch you know what i'm referring to
[2:57:15] <DSD24> The council messed with the Quarians too
[2:57:16] <T_Sasquatch> The green me3 ending goes against so much of what mass effect has shown you. Forcibly changing millions of people is so insane
[2:57:23] <knight_verse> The only good Reaper is a dead one.
[2:57:28] <%aWanderingKaivo> I always felt like the human genetic variance thing was a weird silly "humans are so special" thing without much real reasoning
[2:57:33] <%RetroCop87> RELOAD
[2:57:33] <%RubberFistFight> @GarbageNirvana I pick the green ending because it's literally the "third option" that escapes the cycle and starts something new. Both of the other options are literally just doing the same thing as the last 50 million years and expecting something different.
[2:57:36] <Josef_Stryker> Yeah the cure is only really worth it if both Wrex and Eve survive. If it's just Wrex it's uncertain if he alone can keep the Krogan in check. And if Wreav is in charge, it's basically a lost cause.
[2:57:40] <%StaceMcGate> yeah, by the time humanity enters the galactic stage all the other species have inter-bred and colonized multiple worlds and biomes. but HUMANS are the most diversified?
[2:57:41] <%jackelzxaa> if krogans ran into serious problems with geth it'd lead to another war that would devistate galactic stability
[2:57:44] <peachy996> Green Ending is insane and Blue Ending makes me uncomfortable
[2:57:49] <%ainzhelm> Guys it’s literally just a Hiroshima bomb analogy
[2:57:51] <Josef_Stryker> I pick Destroy personally
[2:58:05] <%jackelzxaa> other species can't breed with eachother, asari can breed while using another speecies as a seed
[2:58:10] <%jackelzxaa> but those aren't salarian or turian babies
[2:58:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The reapers are wrong to assume that all conflict is bad anyway.
[2:58:16] <%jackelzxaa> they're asari with traits
[2:58:17] <%RubberFistFight> @peachy996 Red completely invalidates a number of decisions you make throughout all three games so it's an automatic non-starter for me.
[2:58:23] <%shadowsofpain> @sp3ctre48 yeah true, the quarians over reacted but they made their choice and had to love with it. makes sense that in order to get a peaceful resolution was for legion to be involved
[2:58:25] <%athuramn> @ainzhelm someone finally said it lol
[2:58:30] <%Nyanlathotep> @StaceMcGate That's a good point, actually. I'd buy humans as being the most genetically diverse if Asari didn't literally assimilate other species' DNA into themselves.
[2:58:30] <ioci2112> @T_Sasquatch that's why destroy is the best ending, and fuck you all, my shepard won't take the whole's galaxy individuality just because some fucking AI using his ptsd against him will totally work, also people kill each other all time for different reasons, how is making everyone part robot gonna fix that
[2:58:39] <+Peacefrog7> @Monkeyweed21 if the council let the krogan keep expanding couldnt they just forcfully expand council space into the terminus ( not very diplomatic i know)
[2:58:43] <%ainzhelm> @rubberfistfight No it doesn’t. It’s called a sacrifice
[2:58:44] <T_Sasquatch> Destroy made no sense to me because you will literally kill the geth and edi. Why the fuck would i kill edi
[2:58:46] <DSD24> I hate the starchild so much
[2:58:48] <Sp3ctre48> There was no avoiding a war back then, the Krogan were culturally not ready to join the galactic community because the Salarian's uplifted them before they were ready
[2:58:50] <knight_verse> Any ending where the Reapers are still around means that they can just start over cullong another halaxy that also has organic life.
[2:59:01] <%aWanderingKaivo> @Josef_Stryker I'm here to kill reapers, and destroy is the only one that does that, so same. The other AI are casualties of war
[2:59:04] <%StaceMcGate> @ainzhelm that's underselling a mutating virus that only targets a specific species that creates trillions of stillborn children
[2:59:05] <%jackelzxaa> the reapers could have worked in 3 if the reasoning wasn't half baked. you could have easily written it in a way that takes into account the history of the galaxy in more than just "ai bad" to justify an archival process from the "god" standpoint
[2:59:16] <+Peacefrog7> @T_Sasquatch careful with ending talk dont spoil the angry man
[2:59:19] <Prism_Wing> :)
[2:59:23] <peachy996> @RubberFistFight Blue Ending feels like putting the future of the galaxy into the hands of Reaper King Shepherd and whatever stupid writing Bioware comes up with.
[2:59:24] <%Monkeyweed21> @Nyanlathotep they just look at the fathers genetic history and use that to randomize some traits, they dont actually take the Krogan or Salarian DNA
[2:59:48] <Sp3ctre48> yeah probably chill with the ME3 ending talk
[2:59:49] <%RubberFistFight> @T_Sasquatch It's not taking anyone's individuality though. That's directly addressed in the Catalyst's statements - the reason Synthesis failed previously is because it was rejected by the species, which implies that the choice is more than just shepards. Also, it doesn't turn everyone into the Borg, people still have their individuality.
[2:59:51] <T_Sasquatch> @peacefrog7 hasn't pat literally played mass effect a million times
[2:59:51] <Josef_Stryker> Also, who's to say Starchild is being 100% truthful? They're the Reapers' creator. Who's to say they aren't just BSing in order to save their own skin by trying to push Shepard towards Control or Synthesis?
[2:59:54] <peachy996> I just couldn't do that.
[2:59:57] <%StaceMcGate> Guys I'm pretty sure that Pat knows what the 3 endings are. He spoils himself often. But if the story is engaging or wacky enough, like JOJO, he doesn't care
[2:59:59] <%shadowsofpain> @ioci2112 It's the Genophage conundrum all over again, synthesis is the lesser of 3 evils
[2:59:59] <+ThomasOfTroy> @DSD24 The least debatable opinion stated in chat for the last 15 minutes
[3:00:02] <%ainzhelm> @stacemcgate I’m talking about the argument being made here by mordin. The debate the writers are trying to represent. Hiroshima is probably the best example from history
[3:00:02] <knight_verse> @t_sasquatch Anyone that thonks that war has a happy perfect conclusion is blind to reality.
[3:00:07] <+Peacefrog7> @T_Sasquatch he never played 3

[3:00:13] <%Nyanlathotep> @Monkeyweed21 That's dumb, but it makes sense
[3:00:15] <noctusmmkay> gief is back
[3:00:15] <Josef_Stryker> Apparently Pat never played ME3. He sandbagged it due to the ending
[3:00:15] <blue8moon> Humans actually have very little genetic diversity as a species, in part due to being a very young species
[3:00:15] <%RubberFistFight> @Josef_Stryker They're a VI, not an AI, and thus incapable of lying.
[3:00:15] <Vikingincognito> STOP ENDING TALK NOW
[3:00:17] <flexwing_> theres been much debate
[3:00:17] <knight_verse> *thinks
[3:00:20] <%jackelzxaa> yeah interspecies breeding isn't actually a thing, they just played fast and loose with it because of fan reaction, but like...i don't think you can safely have human sex with turians or quarians without serious health problems
[3:00:21] <%Monkeyweed21> @Peacefrog7 exactly, but like I said the Council very much subscribes to the Moralist Asari ideals of slow, incremental progress. Just look at how they STILL treat the Volus
[3:00:23] <+Peacefrog7> @T_Sasquatch ever

[3:03:27] <%StaceMcGate> DOG IS OVER, BACK TO ETHICAL DILEMNAS
[3:03:38] <akitanito> gief is tasting your fear with his tongue
[3:03:41] <%walternatorz> I like my air food theory
[3:03:42] <%dekkitout> Selective breeding didnt account for that?
[3:03:43] <$lumporr> blep his lil tongue
[3:03:43] <peachy996> Oh god no not the PTSD kid
[3:03:46] <%NopeBadguy> are you talking about gief or yourself
[3:03:48] <%RubberFistFight> Ahh the results of forced incestual breeding for aesthetic purposes.
[3:03:49] <peachy996> No more ME3 talk
[3:03:49] <%shadowsofpain> @dsd24 Yes, yes they are. as a ME3 apologist I will always say the dream sequences suck dick
[3:03:50] <DSD24> I love this mission
[3:03:52] <$KnivesEve> so what did i miss?
[3:03:52] <%Puffen0> cause imbreeding
[3:03:55] <peachy996> Let's watch the good times
[3:03:58] <flexwing_> shitting on mord
[3:03:59] <+Peacefrog7> this mission reminds me of that one DS9 episode @PatStaresAt
[3:04:01] <peachy996> Genocide
[3:04:02] <%MidnightBurst12> that's fucked
[3:04:06] <Laecerelius> Shitting on Mordin
[3:04:07] <%ainzhelm> Doggo
[3:04:09] <T_Sasquatch> Ethic dilemmas like dog breeds now that's a conversation
[3:04:17] <Vantesla> look at Bull dogs in the very early 1900s they didn't look as well southern bred... LUL
[3:04:22] <$QueequegTheater> Call that kid a bitch
[3:04:23] <$lumporr> @Peacefrog7 is it the one where he betrayed his uniform
[3:04:23] <%NopeBadguy> did i miss the interrupt
[3:04:29] <%captainpodock> Is Gief straight English bulldog or is he an olde English?
[3:04:30] <coreroma> My dog was like that, their tongue never stayed in their mouth
[3:04:34] <+ThomasOfTroy> @DSD24 I just googled, and there's a shorter dreams mod on the nexus. Imma download that
[3:04:41] <knight_verse> @dsd24 I hope you never have to deal with PTSD, if a kid in some game is that difficult to handle for you then the real thing will be worse.
[3:04:43] <%SveriSageAdvice> bless you
[3:04:43] <$QueequegTheater> @captainpodock straight
[3:04:44] <SiameseSneeze> bless you pat
[3:04:54] <%RubberFistFight> @shadowsofpain I think the dreams are a great way to show the effects of mounting trauma on Shep - they're pretty clearly guilt/anxiety/trauma dreams. I'm curious, do you think they suck from a thematic standpoint or a gameplay one?
[3:04:57] <T_Sasquatch> Yeaaaa
[3:04:58] <%MidnightBurst12> bless
[3:04:58] <+Peacefrog7> @Peacefrog7 KEKW
[3:05:08] <noctusmmkay> bless you pat
[3:05:20] <%jackelzxaa> i think there's a dialog with this baby that makes him fight you
[3:05:31] <knight_verse> I love this dude.
[3:05:37] <%NopeBadguy> @RubberFistFight thematic, they're incredibly cliche and don't accomplish their goals
[3:05:41] <Josef_Stryker> @RubberFistFight I just wish they didn't focus on the kid so much. The first one is fine, but how about showing Kaiden/Ashley or anyone else who died throughout the game?
[3:05:41] <+Peacefrog7> @lumporr Avery brooks is so awesome
[3:05:42] <%jackelzxaa> was he this red in the og version
[3:05:48] <T_Sasquatch> @rubberfistfight it just didn't invoke the feeling to me. It was repetitive in terms of execution
[3:05:48] <akitanito> wait what
[3:05:52] <%RubberFistFight> @jackelzxaa Nah you yell at him and insult him so hard he gets a boner and goes YEAH I'M AWESOME I'M GONNA GO FUCK ALL THE FEMALES and runs off.
[3:05:52] <akitanito> did he take his sperm
[3:05:55] <coreroma> @RubberFistFight were allowing dreams into evidence now?
[3:05:55] <Jaysky> Is camera slightly shaking?
[3:05:57] <%shadowsofpain> @rubberfistfight Gameplay, I think if they had just made them the last few seconds it would have works for both
[3:06:05] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Josef_Stryker They don't show the dead squad mates but you do hear their voices.
[3:06:07] <%GarbageNirvana> The renegade option for this is great but idk if Pat's gonna have access to it
[3:06:13] <T_Sasquatch> Oh he brought Tali for this LUL
[3:06:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> So at least there is that.
[3:06:14] <$lumporr> @Peacefrog7 that quote is my text tone for one of my friends
[3:06:16] <%jackelzxaa> @Josef_Stryker theres a mod for the original me3 that changes those sequences to be what you said
[3:06:34] <%RubberFistFight> @NopeBadguy if you say so, but I disagree on both counts.
[3:06:43] <$QueequegTheater> TOO SHORT
[3:06:47] <+Peacefrog7> @Peacefrog7 so good
[3:06:50] <+tigerfang86> FeelsBadMan
[3:06:52] <SaltyAzteca> YOU BETTER KROGAN UP.
[3:06:55] <DSD24> Aww yeah
[3:06:55] <Josef_Stryker> @Too_Much_Nukie I get that, I still wish the kid wasn't emphasized so much. I get that watching a kid die sucks shit, but Shepard only knew said kid for all of 30 seconds.
[3:06:57] <James_Quivers> WRONG ONE
[3:06:57] <DSD24> Lets goo
[3:07:05] <SiameseSneeze> Yeah you pussy!

[3:07:27] <Josef_Stryker> BabyRage
[3:07:28] <%shadowsofpain> Paragon pat
[3:07:29] <%RubberFistFight> @Josef_Stryker The kid is representative of "loss of innocence" as well as being a direct example of someone Shepard feels they failed the save. One of the most often repeated things about war and illness is that the children dying is the worst part.
[3:07:32] <$QueequegTheater> EVEN GIEF THINKS HE'S A PUSSY

[3:10:55] <%jackelzxaa> Pat Shepard: "Ashley is garbage for being racist. kill all batarians, they're all garbage. genocide now." Pat Shepard: "Jacob is garbage for cheating on femshep. How do I sleep with everyone on my ship while being in a relationship with Liara and then dump her for her best friend Tali?"
[3:11:10] <%RubberFistFight> @shadowsofpain I actually feel like using the heavy melee because it's just so OP
[3:11:17] <%aWanderingKaivo> @shadowsofpain still a viable playerbase on pc at least!
[3:11:19] <ScreamLord> YEAH war crimes!
[3:11:28] <%RubberFistFight> also if you import a save at 30 the first third of the game just feels so unfair in favour of you.
[3:11:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Everything in ME3 feels fun to play.
[3:11:36] <%RubberFistFight> you're OP as shit and it's fantastic.

[3:16:35] <Profmcstevie> Good tasty air
[3:16:37] <+FlongBongle> Maelon has such a whiny bitch voice
[3:16:42] <Sp3ctre48> I'm here to see Mordin's sexy face
[3:16:43] <$SGrim> @MisterAvry Mordin is 8 years from death. He speed up in the face of mortality.
[3:16:50] <%jackelzxaa> maelon is a little twerp
[3:17:04] <%brisk_dacat> He’s licking the atoms off food
[3:17:06] <T_Sasquatch> Mordin is a special boy

[3:17:42] <%Nyanlathotep> ***
[3:17:42] <%AncelDeLambert> ....nah, the Krogans committed cultural genocide on themselves, Wrex made that clear
[3:17:42] <CollinsOfBodom> we live in a society
[3:17:43] <$realm_forge> NERD FIGHT
[3:17:46] <%dd44dostivei> salarians go hard
[3:17:47] <%Cykron> Loving the chest handle
[3:17:47] <ScreamLord> Mealon looks like the devil
[3:17:48] <%tank7013> "I learned it from YOU dad!"
[3:17:48] <+MisterAvry> well not just cultural genocide, like genocide genocide
[3:17:48] <Profmcstevie> Don't pass the buck coward
[3:17:50] <+Shoosler> kill him
[3:17:51] <%dekkitout> There is... logic on his tongue...
[3:17:56] <+vaderxyz1970> I thought that the Genophage was made 1000 years ago?
[3:17:57] <%AncelDeLambert> I learned it from you, DAD!
[3:17:58] <mak0t0yukii> CRAZY NERD
[3:18:00] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Told you Mordin sucks
[3:18:02] <+black_pariah> is the sound delayed for anyone else of should i f5
[3:18:02] <%aWanderingKaivo> dude's in so deep he's got TWO omni tools
[3:18:04] <TheMostAverageGamer4> same
[3:18:07] <jorniev> I LEARNED FROM YOU DAD
[3:18:14] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt CONTENT
[3:18:20] <James_Quivers> He plays Devils Advocate a lot
[3:18:20] <%RubberFistFight> lol this guy and his insane troll logic
[3:18:22] <Sp3ctre48> Maelon please what does that even mean
[3:18:26] <%jackelzxaa> i can't believe a future generation misinterpreted the reasoning of the past, crazy.
[3:18:26] <SaltyAzteca> It may not be a changed mind, it could be a justification of consequences. At least, thats how I see it
[3:18:27] <$lumporr> KROGAN GALAXYYYY WOOOOOO
[3:18:30] <$hattrick61> Morally right or not he is full of shit
[3:18:31] <%AncelDeLambert> see, this is the inherent problem in "morality" systems, they're inherently inflexible
[3:18:32] <+tigerfang86> what
[3:18:34] <%GarbageNirvana> Paragon Shepard just wants the moral high ground no matter what
[3:18:35] <+tigerfang86> W h a t
[3:18:36] <%jackelzxaa> i love these hypotheticals
[3:18:36] <%ape_hawk> the council DID take steps, with the genophage
[3:18:38] <%RubberFistFight> "MAYBE IF WE DIDN'T GENOPHAGE, THEN THE REAPERS WOULD BE FRIENDLY, DID YOU EVER CONSIDER THAT SHEPARD?!"
[3:18:40] <%jackelzxaa> theyre so fun to think about
[3:18:45] <Profmcstevie> mights and maybes
[3:18:49] <%AncelDeLambert> you're forced to play to one "morality" even when it doesn't fit to your own and starts going all over the place
[3:18:52] <knight_verse> HE SOUNDS LIKE THE INTERNET
[3:18:52] <DSD24> A bunch of mabyes
[3:18:56] <+cahv123> Shepard you just went on a like 12 minute tirade about how the genophage should have never been implemented now you're arguing that fixing it could be a bigger problem. which is the reason it was made. Sighs
[3:18:58] <%OldOnyx> Is it okay to say Bioware's writing isn't as good as a lot of people like to think it is?
[3:19:00] <SiameseSneeze> would they?
[3:19:02] <Jaysky> Could see it as Shepard somewhat agreeing with Mordin?
[3:19:07] <ovan20> very unlikely
[3:19:09] <jorniev> DOG NOISES
[3:19:12] <James_Quivers> LOOK AT THE GOD DAMN SIMS, MAELON
[3:19:12] <Jaysky> After being talked to throughout
[3:19:14] <doggieo> Fanboy
[3:19:15] <+dreamquestisgreat> If the Krogan expand, then we take our blitzballs and go into their space...
[3:19:17] <DSD24> Punch!
[3:19:19] <peachy996> Maelon lives with a fuckton of guilt and you'll get to know more in LOTSB
[3:19:19] <%OldOnyx> *wasn't
[3:19:20] <%ItalianWaifu> Tali wasn't fazed
[3:19:21] <%dekkitout> So is Maelon like... misplaced optimism or what?
[3:19:21] <%Cykron> DON'T POINT THAT AT MY WIFE
[3:19:22] <wolverinewaswrong> Man Shepard folded fast on the genophage here
[3:19:24] <%RubberFistFight> @AncelDeLambert that was 2s biggest weakness imho. It would actively penalise you for "inconsistent decisions".
[3:19:25] <knight_verse> Bruh
[3:19:25] <mak0t0yukii> OH SHT
[3:19:25] <DSD24> No don't do it

[3:23:31] <%RubberFistFight> @T_Sasquatch if you're thinking about unit 731, most of it actually wasn't viable because the "experiments" were poorly run and very obviously just torture attempting to justify itself as science.

[3:24:41] <$SGrim> @NeroInfinite For Wrex

[3:24:46] <CollinsOfBodom> owned
[3:24:47] <@commanderclaw> X: Doubt
[3:24:47] <wolverinewaswrong> Ilos was pretty chill ngl
[3:24:47] <%zhenthrim213> sure
[3:24:49] <romc215> Yeah, you wish pat
[3:24:49] <%jackelzxaa> jack is bald
[3:24:49] <Profmcstevie> Funding priorities
[3:24:50] <%AncelDeLambert> of course it is, Pat /-
[3:24:50] <Chaos_Aether> x to doubt
[3:24:50] <%crazyspartan214> no proof
[3:24:51] <willyfreshness> Baldness was the OTHER genophage
[3:24:52] <$lumporr> @AWKWARDL0SER it's thinning!!! ':(
[3:24:52] <%Deft_Thought> 🤔
[3:24:52] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt So what's your excuse then
[3:24:53] <TioXyco> sure pat, sure
[3:24:53] <peachy996> Okay Costanza
[3:24:54] <%JoshManVGH> Do a big heist Pat, do it, do crimes!
[3:24:55] <+critikal_bit> It's true
[3:24:56] <%ainzhelm> You also get a good smg from Kasumi’s mission
[3:24:56] <satans_finest_millennial> to bad is so far in da future
[3:24:56] <%valriot> But you got the small dick email???
[3:24:56] <%StaceMcGate> Doubt
[3:24:57] <mak0t0yukii> Is your penis big?
[3:24:58] <+NoriBasket> PogChamp
[3:24:59] <%Puhff> LYING
[3:24:59] <Psyramics> those are lies spread but the Bald Eugenicists
[3:24:59] <%Dakuu75> Krogussy
[3:24:59] <+ThomasOfTroy> @T_Sasquatch iirc Nazi experiments on Jews involving hypothermia have proved to be useful
[3:24:59] <%miguelrod777> X
[3:25:00] <ioci2112> Kappa
[3:25:00] <knight_verse> @awkwardl0ser They tried when they were reviving him, they failed.
[3:25:01] <+unhuggable1> jack is bald and has a huge dick
[3:25:01] <Goatllama> but not in the present
[3:25:02] <%aWanderingKaivo> baldness is a combat advantage, less hair for people to grab
[3:25:03] <%Deft_Thought> So Jack has a huge hog?
[3:25:04] <+Peacefrog7> Are you talking about Picard @PatStaresAt
[3:25:05] <NeroInfinite> Sure pat whatever makes you feel better.
[3:25:06] <%Rumbutt> When they brought Pat Shephard back they made sure to make him MORE bald
[3:25:06] <%SaiyanShoto> Then why does your Shepard have it?
[3:25:06] <ScreamLord> Baldness IS a dominate trait. Like Silverback Gorillas
[3:25:08] <James_Quivers> No other species seem to have hair so it makes sense no one has bothered to cure baldness
[3:25:08] <+AWKWARDL0SER> I was not aware of that
[3:25:08] <%ItalianWaifu> easy fix with gene therapy but only a real badass accepts himself as he is
[3:25:09] <RetributionP> thresher steaks
[3:25:09] <+DACH33ZMAN> prove it you wont
[3:25:09] <%Piemono> What does baldness mean now?
[3:25:11] <+senfood> Baldness is legit an indicator of high T.
[3:25:13] <%king_wragles> @jackelzxaa Ya and she's hung, what's your point?
[3:25:13] <+rich_mon> FEAR
[3:25:14] <Alzero83> LIES
[3:25:15] <s1rcuit> I do remember reading something about baldness being linked to high testosterone levels
[3:25:15] <TourettesPlays> Someone once asked Sir Patrick Stewart "In the future wouldn't they have a cure for baldness?" and Sir Patrick said "In the future they wouldn't care"
[3:25:16] <+D00msDayDan> According to my doujins it already is
[3:25:16] <%dekkitout> You sayin you packing heavy ordinance tajRLY
[3:25:18] <JetpackMcQuack> it is now too, but we haven't discovered it
[3:25:18] <$realm_forge> Can I get a hot mug of Wrex’s voice next time I catch a cold?
[3:25:19] <wolverinewaswrong> PATRICK STEWART SAID tHIS ON STAR TREK
[3:25:19] <stantheman_97> that's why that one krogan female asked for shep dick
[3:25:19] <RetributionP> no it's not
[3:25:21] <$QueequegTheater> OOPS
[3:25:24] <sekihoe> i'd be okay with losing hair if made my wiener bigger
[3:25:25] <peachy996> oops
[3:25:30] <%jackelzxaa> the illusive man wanted shepard's penis to be as big as it was before, no changes that could effect him in any way
[3:25:34] <%zhenthrim213> Tombs should kill you
[3:25:34] <%DashXero> Who the fuck is Toombs?
[3:25:34] <Josef_Stryker> BIG OOPS
[3:25:34] <LunarRemix> Wait did Picard really say that?
[3:25:35] <+DACH33ZMAN> Yikes
[3:25:36] <James_Quivers> COOMBS
[3:25:37] <knight_verse> The haoe was too dead to bring back with Shepard
[3:25:38] <ScreamLord> Too bad this email leads to NOTHING
[3:25:41] <+Shoosler> @senfood or low T
[3:25:41] <peachy996> Look Toombs I just changed my mind okay
[3:25:42] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you forgot to turn in the quests
[3:25:44] <knight_verse> *hair
[3:25:44] <Sp3ctre48> "haha I have no comeback to this Toombs, idk why I'm working with Cerberus either"
[3:25:45] <%DashXero> Ah.
[3:25:48] <%g4mejoy> Pat Shepard's cybernetically enhanced virility made him even more bald? This is an interesting codec entry.
[3:25:50] <wolverinewaswrong> Toombs is right
[3:25:50] <%RetroCop87> Krogans sending emails just feels weird
[3:25:54] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt so Shepard never responds to any e-mails, he jsut reads them?
[3:25:55] <stantheman_97> give grunt a smooch
[3:25:55] <%DashXero> Well, guess he's gonna be mad.
[3:25:59] <ScreamLord> Collector gear looks pretty cool
[3:26:05] <Josef_Stryker> Toombs was one of the survivors of Akuze (The Sole Survivor backstory)
[3:26:06] <%42nfl19> Wait is Shepard's military email public that anyone can message him?
[3:26:07] <DSD24> Collector Armor is cool
[3:26:08] <peachy996> Talk to Mordin and Grunt
[3:26:09] <%goose_attack_almanac> Do the kasumi mission
[3:26:13] <%rockcentuar> talk to miranda
[3:26:14] <%StaceMcGate> gonna talk to Mordin?
[3:26:15] <+Mr_Misanthropy> Shepard, you've changed man.
[3:26:16] <+DACH33ZMAN> I cant wait for this dialogue
[3:26:17] <%StaceMcGate> or Grunt?
[3:26:18] <%goose_attack_almanac> is my vote
[3:26:18] <%jackelzxaa> in me3 you can take the helmet off in cutscenes so those full body armors are actually worth using
[3:26:27] <T_Sasquatch> Collector armor is hilarious in cutscenes
[3:26:27] <%tank7013> I feel like this game doesn't really touch on just how fucked some of the stuff Cerberus does is
[3:26:28] <%shadowsofpain> talk to the crew
[3:26:30] <$Solid_Stro> I like wearing the Cerberus Armor and telling people I’m not with Cerberus c4sageLUL c4sageLUL c4sageLUL
[3:26:31] <+DACH33ZMAN> no hes walking away :(
[3:26:33] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Kasumi's mission gets you a cool gun
[3:26:34] <%RubberFistFight> @T_Sasquatch SOME data was salvageable, but the argument is that using it in any way comes dangerously close to exonerating the methods used to gain the knowledge, which might inspire further "experimentation" in future. And I can't honestly say I completely disagree with that logic.
[3:26:36] <ExpressNode> Got back from playing games, did he colonize that blussy yet?
[3:26:37] <%dekkitout> Faish
[3:26:40] <+unhuggable1> Toombs had thresher maw acid injected into his veins
[3:26:48] <Vikingincognito> ???
[3:26:51] <RetributionP> look at the armor in the viewer Atleast at sompoint?
[3:26:52] <Vikingincognito> Its like no different
[3:26:53] <%jackelzxaa> mordin's has less scuffs and scratches i think
[3:26:55] <GuilKato> You should get the collector armor @PatStaresAt because you will look like Ze Arsehole
[3:26:58] <Jaysky> I like the white shoulders
[3:26:58] <Vikingincognito> It's the least memorable one
[3:27:00] <knight_verse> Yep, it's better.
[3:27:00] <+Peacefrog7> talk to mordin
[3:27:00] <%dekkitout> 30% more drip
[3:27:01] <+FlongBongle> Same but better
[3:27:01] <%aWanderingKaivo> I like his original look though, more like a labcoat
[3:27:02] <%goose_attack_almanac> Does.. Miranda's expose her stomach
[3:27:02] <$QueequegTheater> Mordin needs cool guy shades like Thane
[3:27:06] <%goose_attack_almanac> or is that just the lighting
[3:27:07] <+Peacefrog7> pretty please
[3:27:07] <%Cykron> More white is better for Morty
[3:27:17] <$SGrim> @ExpressNode The Qussy remains unpumped.
[3:27:20] <$QueequegTheater> @goose_attack_almanac no, that's a reflection
[3:27:28] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you forgot to turn in the sidequests
[3:27:29] <%jackelzxaa> 10 for a full bar
[3:27:29] <wolverinewaswrong> I like keeping the normal outfits until the suicide mission
[3:27:30] <%aWanderingKaivo> @goose_attack_almanac it does not
[3:27:31] <%crazyspartan214> let hear the Mordin sing
[3:27:32] <Sp3ctre48> @tank7013 It brings it up sometimes but the game itself doesn't really care to think about how silly it is for a Shepard with the Sole Survivor backstory to be working for Cerberus
[3:27:32] <%captain_thickthighs> captain_thickthighs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Six months longer than most of my relationships it's been good. No homo jk

[3:27:34] <Profmcstevie> Drip excessive, but comfortable. Vibrant. Powerful. Justifiably proud.
[3:27:34] <@Moobot> @QuestlordJake I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 27m.
[3:27:35] <satans_finest_millennial> check up on the ol war crimer
[3:27:35] <wolverinewaswrong> Feels like a prep time thing
[3:27:37] <+DACH33ZMAN> YAY TALKING
[3:27:38] <%OldOnyx> I mean he was only kept in a tube and constantly tortured for years. Whats the big deal, right?
[3:27:39] <RetributionP> new armor!
[3:27:41] <%rockcentuar> 10
[3:27:43] <Jaysky> The white gives him the "lab coat" look, so I prefer his regular look. His new clothes do look nice though however.
[3:27:44] <GuilKato> 10
[3:27:48] <T_Sasquatch> @rubberfistfight i guess the question becomes , its better to atleast gain knowledge from it than let the lives that were destroyed go to waste
[3:27:49] <%rockcentuar> it takes 10 points
[3:27:52] <NitronStreams> AW YEAH
[3:27:55] <DSD24> I love this cutscene too
[3:27:57] <peachy996> I do
[3:28:01] <+DACH33ZMAN> Yes yes yes yes
[3:28:01] <%shadowsofpain> Kasumi too in case of new dialog
[3:28:02] <+Peacefrog7> wait idk if its this one
[3:28:03] <%jackelzxaa> yeah mordin's armor doesn't have dust and scuffs on it anymore
[3:28:05] <Alzero83> Tali wont love you till you do her loyalty mission, Coward @PatStaresAt
[3:28:11] <%jackelzxaa> garrus's armor not fixing for the loyalty variant was a bummer
[3:28:16] <+D00msDayDan> Is it time for mordin to sing?
[3:28:18] <%RubberFistFight> @T_Sasquatch that's the other side of the coin, yeah.
[3:28:26] <tattleworm> there was gonna be a loyalty crisis for mordin and grunt too but it got cut for whatever reason
[3:28:31] <TourettesPlays> Literal sociopath species lmao
[3:28:35] <T_Sasquatch> He's just so fucking amazing. What a great character
[3:28:38] <+carswellmusic> enigmaKEK
[3:28:42] <%Varlinator> DEAL WITH IT
[3:28:43] <%RubberFistFight> oh boy mordin's telling some big lies right now
[3:28:49] <RetributionP> mordins is so cool
[3:28:49] <+akscully> love that salarians speedrun through emotional phases
[3:28:51] <%RubberFistFight> BIIIIIG liar
[3:29:04] <%captain_thickthighs> damn breaking up with a Salarain mist be awesome
[3:29:08] <Jaysky> One thing that sells Mordin is his voice actor and way of talking
[3:29:08] <%RubberFistFight> @akscully they don't, he's just trying to reconcile.
[3:29:12] <%AncelDeLambert> no time to get hung up on shit when you die in three decades
[3:29:12] <+OneGorillionDollars> salarians are the embodiment of " I'm stupid FASTER"
[3:29:13] <DSD24> Yeah I got that shit back there
[3:29:16] <T_Sasquatch> (I'm fine) - man who is not fine
[3:29:17] <James_Quivers> MORDIN SAYS LOVE IS JUST CHEMICALS
[3:29:18] <+Romuken> Is... Is Mordin a virgin?
[3:29:19] <DSD24> Ahahaha
[3:29:20] <+unhuggable1> ha
[3:29:25] <+vaderxyz1970> I feel like Salarians would be "I am sad................I am no longer sad."
[3:29:27] <%dekkitout> We just throwin salarian morphology under the bus for closure?
[3:29:27] <%jackelzxaa> its later pat

[3:29:42] <T_Sasquatch> Mordin Fucks

[3:30:04] <%RubberFistFight> guys this isn't even close to the end of mordin's story, stop taking his comments at face value, there's still a whole other game to go yet.
[3:30:06] <Dunmarkh> @QueequegTheater yes
[3:30:08] <%captain_thickthighs> I thought more than a bang that lady on Omega or whatever

[3:30:46] <%condemned_15> when does Kelly twerk in the captains quarters?
[3:30:47] <RetributionP> so human hearts pump harder then krogan hearts?
[3:30:47] <tuesti> Puberty
[3:30:48] <%Cykron> IT'S CALLED SEMEN
[3:30:52] <+Peacefrog7> aww this means i missed you killing worf and telling him to shut the fuck up @PatStaresAt
[3:30:53] <%RubberFistFight> Grunt just had too much baby batter on the brain
[3:30:56] <%Tman451> the texture work in this is legit incredible
[3:31:04] <%Cykron> CUMBRAIN
[3:31:09] <GuilKato> your Krogan frog son is now a man - sheperd is a proud papa
[3:31:11] <T_Sasquatch> THIS is literally the perfect krogan. And he's NUTS
[3:31:12] <ScreamLord> Now?
[3:31:14] <%DashXero> Grunt was always a little unhinged.
[3:31:16] <peachy996> Nuts but focused
[3:31:18] <%StaceMcGate> Got all the Krogan Jizz still
[3:31:18] <$SGrim> GRUNT HAS CHOSEN VIOLENCE
[3:31:18] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You should take Grunt everywhere
[3:31:18] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Krogans are dumb

[3:31:49] <%RubberFistFight> Oh man Zaeed's fucken great in 3. RIP robin sachs.
[3:32:02] <blackjack8182> He’s so cool
[3:32:12] <%Cykron> Shepard's entire Squad died to a Thresher Maw
[3:32:13] <DarkJaguar124> Yeah Zaeed is my least favorite squad mate. Maybe if they went with his original look...
[3:32:14] <RetributionP> do Jack's mission to get it out of the way. it's so borning
[3:32:14] <peachy996> Zaeed feels like a character that had his own spin off game
[3:32:17] <roscoe_rosaline> How tf do I convince my friend that the wildlife in Australia really isn't that bad? I want them to visit.
[3:32:21] <tattleworm> zaeed and garrus at the party might be my favourite part of 3
[3:32:22] <%RubberFistFight> @QueequegTheater he's awesome. A completely unhinged loose cannon asshole... but awesome.
[3:32:31] <jorniev> I hope they let you bring 3 party members next game
[3:32:36] <+Mr_Misanthropy> I totally forgot kasumi existed
[3:32:36] <%jackelzxaa> zaeed was going to be a bigger deal in original me2
[3:32:38] <+RowenCleric> Zaeed makes me feel like he made up all his stories and isnt nearly as badass as he puts off
[3:32:41] <%dekkitout> No, she was making a pass at you as well
[3:32:47] <DSD24> He doesn't
[3:32:48] <T_Sasquatch> Zaeed is that star wars character that enters your crew and their entire alignment is red
[3:32:50] <Shatterthought> @Mr_Misanthropy all according to her plan. ruuSip
[3:32:51] <%jackelzxaa> has pat exhausted jacob and miranda?
[3:32:53] <DarkJaguar124> Jacob does not deserve better...
[3:32:54] <$lumporr> wait can pat bang tali *and* kelly?
[3:32:55] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt are we sure she's not banging your fish
[3:32:56] <Jaysky> Gossiping goose
[3:32:57] <%42nfl19> Is Kasumi DLC or vanilla?
[3:32:58] <+DBTenno> But the priiiiiiiiize
[3:33:01] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I find Kasumi...very hot
[3:33:03] <%jackelzxaa> everyone has 2-6 post-loyalty mission convos
[3:33:06] <%Varlinator> Kasumi knows what kind of boat she's on Kappa
[3:33:07] <+SilverDevilfish> "I'll fuck ANYTHING" - Kelly
[3:33:07] <Shatterthought> Kasumi is DLC
[3:33:09] <NeroInfinite> DLC
[3:33:09] <%RubberFistFight> @roscoe_rosaline Visit? Lol when, our borders are still closed unless you're a nat-lib donor, a celeb, an athlete, or rich.
[3:33:09] <DSD24> Kasumi is DLC
[3:33:10] <%DashXero> We are not sure.
[3:33:10] <stormhawk9891> DLC
[3:33:12] <%dekkitout> ... we are not sure
[3:33:12] <%Monkeyweed21> @RowenCleric no his stories are real and most of them end with "and then all my men died"
[3:33:12] <$QueequegTheater> SHE MIGHT BE
[3:33:13] <Laecerelius> Zaeed is Canderous but less badass
[3:33:14] <arkv01> just bang your fish to make sure
[3:33:14] <Josef_Stryker> Kelly totally would fuck a fish
[3:33:16] <%Cykron> Kelly just wants Shepard because he keeps coming back from missions smelling like Varren
[3:33:20] <TourettesPlays> @jackelzxaa he was exhausted of them since the beginning of the game lol
[3:33:21] <wolverinewaswrong> Wait these guyts comment on your missions?

[3:33:33] <$QueequegTheater> THIS WOMAN IS A BIOWEAPON
[3:33:34] <%goose_attack_almanac> Hey, Fish have eggs, Kelly has eggs. They have a lot in common
[3:33:34] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Jacob deserves better cause this isnt a fem shep. You guys like Racist mordin but hate Jacob who hasnt done shit yet
[3:33:34] <%StaceMcGate> I vote for Kasumi mission now
[3:33:40] <RetributionP> side quest

[3:34:42] <%whyskeywolfe> And then Seth Green demanded he fuck a robawt
[3:34:47] <Sp3ctre48> I hate Jacob because he's boring and his loyalty mission is stupid. Mordin being a mass murderer at least makes him an interesting character
[3:34:48] <+RoByte2> EDI is DTF

[3:36:08] <peachy996> AND stupid
[3:36:13] <T_Sasquatch> I dislike Jacob because he's just rude as fuck for no reason
[3:36:16] <peachy996> We will find out in 3
[3:36:19] <%machshop> Jacob is a waste of a character slot
[3:36:19] <BurdRightsActivist> I like the big dumb radiation symbol on his gun, looks like a fallout 1 thing 4Head
[3:36:23] <$QueequegTheater> If they're so smart how come they die easy

[3:39:00] <%RubberFistFight> @Laecerelius Australian limes are no joke, they've got spiders in em.
[3:39:00] <%king_wragles> Is that a fucking nuke strapped to Pat's back?
[3:39:02] <ExpressNode> I wonder how that would be with our world leaders
[3:39:02] <%Puffen0> "these things work themselves out"
[3:39:04] <%kyh9> kyh9 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! When are you doing Shadow Broker?

[3:39:08] <iosephe> just like politicians
[3:39:12] <%jackelzxaa> pat did you do the krogan doctor's sidequest
[3:39:20] <%AncelDeLambert> If pee is stored in the balls, then Krogans must piss like a firehose
[3:39:25] <+ThomasOfTroy> @king_wragles Just a small one
[3:39:28] <%DorianCreed> Also, considering they live for like 1000 years, "soon" is relative
[3:39:28] <%RubberFistFight> yeah go borker some shadowrs

[3:39:44] <%StaceMcGate> Chat please, let him leave this goddam planet
[3:39:44] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Did you talk to Wrex after doing Grunt's quest?
[3:39:44] <jorniev> remember that krogan who jumped from low orbit and because he survived he got MAD PUSS?

[3:40:43] <+DACH33ZMAN> CRIME KILLS KIDS YA YA YA
[3:40:43] <DSD24> Doing Garrus's mission renegade is real cool
[3:40:43] <%machshop> MURDER SQUAD
[3:40:44] <satans_finest_millennial> Garish
[3:40:45] <RetributionP> what about Jack tho?
[3:40:52] <%RubberFistFight> Make sure you get a good look at the Techno Turian on Thane's mission.
[3:40:54] <%RubberFistFight> since he's cool.
[3:40:54] <youngin_______420> How can destiny be better?
[3:40:56] <%daemonazaezal> area overload is better imo
[3:40:58] <peachy996> Oh yeah cuz Bekenstein is around here
[3:40:58] <%StaceMcGate> Samara, Jack, Tali, Legion, Kasumi, and Zaeed left
[3:41:00] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> He hasn't done Kasumi's yet?
[3:41:01] <peachy996> Good idea
[3:41:01] <RetributionP> I would rather get jack out of they way
[3:41:11] <ExpressNode> Then you'll be a one pump chump
[3:41:11] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Her mission has the best smg in the game
[3:41:13] <satans_finest_millennial> very clipable
[3:41:15] <+DBTenno> Garish Garrus
[3:41:18] <iosephe> #squadgoals
[3:41:21] <ScreamLord> Thane gives to opposite of Armor-Piercing. He gives Flesh Rending
[3:41:23] <%Gloom_Tangerine> Then what you want is warp ammo
[3:41:36] <+black_pariah> @PatStaresAt Did you hear about the 4 player Control Sequel?
[3:41:43] <%RubberFistFight> Guys if you wanna know who he has/hasn't done, look under the feet of the character models on the "pick your team" screen. The ones with red circles are loyal/completed.
[3:41:46] <%whyskeywolfe> Pat has assembled a motley crew of aliens like the Turian, the Asari, the Krogran and the Australian.
[3:41:47] <RetributionP> yeah warp ammo is 10/10
[3:41:51] <%shadowsofpain> @retributionp Jack requires max paragon or renegade due too the argument at the end
[3:41:51] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Warp ammo does less bonus damage than AP
[3:41:56] <%dekkitout> @ScreamLord Flechette?
[3:41:57] <DarkJaguar124> I heard Jack's ammo is pretty good too.
[3:42:02] <Vikingincognito> What makes AP better than Warp?
[3:42:08] <DarkJaguar124> Warp I think?
[3:42:17] <Diece_leaf> !uptime
[3:42:17] <@Moobot> @Diece_leaf I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 42m.
[3:42:20] <%tinyswampthing> did you guys see that video of how game breaking me3 garrus is if you build him correctly
[3:42:20] <Zalapski> colonel tigh pls
[3:42:21] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Higer bonus damage to armor and health
[3:42:24] <%daemonazaezal> wap i believe is best overall
[3:42:35] <%daemonazaezal> ap is like super punch armor
[3:42:43] <%daemonazaezal> till insanity
[3:42:51] <ScreamLord> @dekkitout More like cheese graters
[3:42:53] <%jackelzxaa> warp ammo's good for collectors and ecclipse and some krogan but that's it
[3:42:54] <holyxgrale> I will be making the change immediately
[3:42:58] <Jaysky> On higher difficulties I think it gets way more useful
[3:43:02] <brovietto> wait
[3:43:04] <nuane> nail his ass Kappa
[3:43:06] <brovietto> it's Doc Mitchell!
[3:43:06] <%shadowsofpain> on normal yeah AP's better
[3:43:06] <Psyramics> he's in the new Battlestar Gallactica
[3:43:07] <%jackelzxaa> shredder ammo is completely worthless because ice ammo exists
[3:43:07] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt he was on Battlestar Galatica
[3:43:08] <Goraka91> BSG
[3:43:08] <Zalapski> Battlestar
[3:43:08] <+TheBitingIrish> New Vegas Doc Mitchel
[3:43:08] <+ThomasOfTroy> Captain Bailey is colonel Tigh from battlestar galactica
[3:43:09] <TheMostAverageGamer4> hes a general is skyrim
[3:43:10] <Hugsloth> He's the doctor from NV
[3:43:10] <Vikingincognito> But LOTS of enemies have Blue Kinetic Shields
[3:43:11] <tattleworm> saul tigh
[3:43:12] <+EmptyMug> Doc Mitch
[3:43:12] <%Shubreaker> OH
[3:43:13] <%Faustgesicht> The doctor from new vegas
[3:43:14] <+EmptyMug> Yep
[3:43:15] <$hattrick61> pulled that bullet out your nogvin
[3:43:15] <%RubberFistFight> @jackelzxaa warp ammo can carry your ass through the final mission, it's kinda crazy.
[3:43:15] <SiameseSneeze> Yuuup
[3:43:15] <Dunmarkh> neat
[3:43:16] <%CalderGaming> tigh
[3:43:18] <+CarrowayFashonti> Holy Shit it is

[3:43:24] <+TheBitingIrish> Michael Hogan
[3:43:24] <blackjack8182> Battlestar
[3:43:25] <ScreamLord> Oh shit you're right!
[3:43:27] <%king_wragles> Michael Hogan if you care for the VA's name
[3:43:27] <James_Quivers> Kill him for his Doc Bags
[3:43:28] <%sunsetdisc0> its also general tullius from skyrim
[3:43:29] <+grassglassgass> skyram
[3:43:30] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Sol BSG
[3:43:30] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Also General Tullius and Saul Tigh
[3:43:31] <Ravioli_Ronin> Battlestar gallactica man
[3:43:31] <DSD24> Figured that bullet did your brain some good
[3:43:32] <wolverinewaswrong> GENERAL TULLIUS
[3:43:33] <Goraka91> Eyepatch man from Battlestar
[3:43:34] <%Faustgesicht> he's a prolific lil bastard
[3:43:34] <+DACH33ZMAN> hes in a bunch of stuff i think
[3:43:36] <%jackelzxaa> the final mission is kinda easy anyways since you're gonna be maxed out no matter what
[3:43:37] <Vikingincognito> Pat tons of enemies have blue kinetic shields though
[3:43:38] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt it's Michael Hogan, he's a canuck. He's also Colonel Tigh on Battlestar Galactica.
[3:43:40] <TheMostAverageGamer4> the imperial gu fro msky rim
[3:43:42] <wolverinewaswrong> The headsman is waiting
[3:43:48] <+OmegaFatalis> yeah he's in a million things since Battlestar Galactica
[3:43:48] <TheMostAverageGamer4> and tv shows
[3:43:51] <RetributionP> it would kill those fat husks and those are like the only enemy's in the game that actually cause problems
[3:43:52] <jorniev> WHAT IN OBLIVION IS THAT?
[3:43:54] <%Puffen0> also one of the big civil war quest guys in skyrim
[3:43:54] <TechDragon_Z> Yeah New Vegas man
[3:44:07] <%jackelzxaa> pat get a tupari
[3:44:15] <$QueequegTheater> GIVE THE MAN HIS REFUND
[3:44:18] <macavells> Pat shep looks like Doc if he was a raider
[3:44:21] <satans_finest_millennial> general tulls mah man
[3:44:21] <%Puffen0> @jorniev this guy gets it lol
[3:44:27] <+DBTenno> Should've brought Grunt along
[3:44:28] <%dekkitout> Cool threads
[3:44:35] <+PenmanLupine> was that the same guy arguing with the Turian in the first game?
[3:44:42] <Laecerelius> Woolie?!
[3:44:44] <%Cykron> Me!
[3:44:46] <%RubberFistFight> @jorniev that shit always makes me laugh, it's delivered so cornily
[3:44:46] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt What do you think is in those two prongs
[3:44:50] <%jackelzxaa> the renegade interupt for this one is so goofy
[3:44:52] <+D00msDayDan> volus are always the most evil
[3:44:59] <%jackelzxaa> these are the weakest bitch krogans ever
[3:45:00] <Vantesla> Inferno Ammo isn't as strong flat based to AP Ammo. But you don't seem to use it on Shotguns so don't see the benefit from my observation... Cryo Ammo is pretty useless on anything with protection in place. My dumb opinion SeemsGood
[3:45:07] <Goraka91> The Lalafell evil
[3:45:09] <+DACH33ZMAN> Why are all volus scummy lol
[3:45:10] <Josef_Stryker> Yes he did
[3:45:11] <%dekkitout> Garry: "Yeah, it's my thing"
[3:45:15] <AllenDeadman> you just escalated it even further
[3:45:15] <James_Quivers> Cutscene Krogans made of tissue paper
[3:45:17] <+DBTenno> Cutscene Ammo the greatest of all
[3:45:17] <churropoppa> Who are the Volus based on ?
[3:45:20] <%jackelzxaa> i don't know if i've ever seen what happens if you don't shoot them
[3:45:20] <jorniev> POOR GUYS
[3:45:21] <%Cykron> Sorta
[3:45:24] <NeroInfinite> Escalate to violence
[3:45:24] <RaidenRising> space lalas
[3:45:26] <+vaderxyz1970> ESCALATE GARRUS ESCALATE!
[3:45:26] <+black_pariah> those krogan got hit with cutscene power
[3:45:28] <+senfood> Garrus is walking, talking escalation. He's Space Punisher.
[3:45:28] <Foopoof> escalation necessary, his breathing was erratic
[3:45:30] <%miguelrod777> you can just tell them to leave and they go
[3:45:32] <+DACH33ZMAN> Damn Pat
[3:45:33] <%bugz_munny> Fuck C-Sec
[3:45:37] <mr_sups> They're Krogan, They went down to some pistol rounds?
[3:45:37] <knight_verse> Should have just let it pass...
[3:45:40] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> If you don't take that interrupt, you just tell them to leave and they do.
[3:45:41] <%crazyspartan214> poor krogan
[3:45:42] <%jackelzxaa> cutscene ammo uses hyperkill bullets
[3:45:42] <%JohnAtDawn> HES TALKING TO THAT VOLUS LIKE HES A CHILD
[3:45:47] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt If you don't shoot them the Krogans just fucking leave
[3:45:50] <TioXyco> with AP Shot, you need no other ammo ever
[3:45:51] <knight_verse> Not using the prompt is so much better.
[3:45:56] <peachy996> And the rest can go to biotics
[3:45:56] <%Rumbutt> FUCKING HARKIN
[3:45:58] <%MugenSandan> Are Volus just sci-fi Lalafells
[3:46:00] <+FennecZephyr> I honestly prever Warp cuz it works on everything
[3:46:01] <knight_verse> in this part
[3:46:02] <+TheBitingIrish> Won't you get fucked over by shields?
[3:46:03] <RetributionP> wait I thought you could only have 1 power?
[3:46:14] <%JohnAtDawn> @MugenSandan KINDA?!
[3:46:15] <%jackelzxaa> you can only have one bonus power
[3:46:19] <%jackelzxaa> even though you have slots for 2
[3:46:32] <DSD24> Harkin has your hairstyle npw
[3:46:33] <$QueequegTheater> @RetributionP You can use squadmate loyalty powers once they're unlocked
[3:46:39] <%StaceMcGate> @RetributionP you can respec
[3:46:39] <peachy996> Oh yeah thats right
[3:46:41] <$hattrick61> POSE
[3:46:41] <%Cykron> LUL
[3:46:44] <DSD24> You bunch of dorks
[3:46:48] <%RetroCop87> such a weak exit
[3:46:49] <%DashXero> Did they have to point in unison?
[3:46:50] <+senfood> Oh great, "Bad Lieutenant" Harkin. That asshole.
[3:46:51] <mak0t0yukii> Oh... good
[3:46:54] <Foopoof> gud
[3:46:56] <+TheBitingIrish> The mechs?
[3:46:57] <trianglehat> Mrauder Shields
[3:46:58] <Vikingincognito> pat thats not true
[3:46:58] <%walternatorz> *at this difficulty
[3:46:59] <%jackelzxaa> pat's on normal so the game is ez
[3:47:01] <%shadowsofpain> on normal yeah
[3:47:01] <akitanito> don't crazytalk yourself
[3:47:02] <%StaceMcGate> Blue Suns and Geth have shields
[3:47:02] <%Mattais88> Geth
[3:47:03] <Jaysky> I love the defeat "Oh... Good..."
[3:47:04] <Vikingincognito> Thats wrong
[3:47:06] <%jackelzxaa> on hardcore shields are on more enemies
[3:47:06] <Slim_Lipid> 🕵️
[3:47:07] <holyxgrale> Have you ever fought an asari commando unit?
[3:47:08] <+OmegaFatalis> but Marauder Shields
[3:47:08] <%Mattais88> Atlus
[3:47:08] <+ThunderZebraKing> Barriers and armor are everywhere
[3:47:08] <%daemonazaezal> didnt you say barriers were least common?
[3:47:09] <%afronooch> not on insanity
[3:47:09] <%RubberFistFight> Yeah you usually encounter like only one or two dudes per huge group that have em, and they're trivial to take down.
[3:47:09] <+unhuggable1> on normal
[3:47:10] <%Shubreaker> that's not true at all
[3:47:10] <NeroInfinite> Ath this difficulty pat
[3:47:12] <%condemned_15> only Maurader
[3:47:13] <tanarath> shotguns do big shield bonus damage
[3:47:13] <+D00msDayDan> pat isn't playing on hardcore/insanity so it doesn't matter
[3:47:13] <Vikingincognito> Biotic barriers are the least common
[3:47:17] <$hattrick61> youre thinking barriers
[3:47:18] <%GarbageNirvana> Also most shields are piss weak
[3:47:20] <Profmcstevie> A few mechs and a few major characters have had shields so far
[3:47:20] <$QueequegTheater> I like how far away you can hear that guy
[3:47:21] <+DACH33ZMAN> Lower levels shields dont do shit lol
[3:47:24] <%jackelzxaa> hardcore is actually pretty balanced. insanity makes all the defenses stupidly inflated
[3:47:25] <+unhuggable1> on insanity everything has shields or barriers
[3:47:26] <%dekkitout> There's no like shield generation support unit for enemies? Wow, games must've been different then
[3:47:27] <TheFramedWarlock> But what about Marauder Shields
[3:47:28] <Vantesla> Play on Insanity and practically all but Husk have shields, barrier, or armor on top of health.
[3:47:29] <ScreamLord> If you don't Renegade those Krogan just fuck off on their own
[3:47:36] <%ainzhelm> No. Barrier least common
[3:47:42] <+vaderxyz1970> "The AI then stared spawning Biotic enemies"
[3:47:42] <Vikingincognito> It goes Flesh/shield/armor/barrier
[3:47:42] <%daemonazaezal> armor > shields > barriers on normal
[3:47:44] <+DACH33ZMAN> Hardened/Insanity you need at least three abilities to deal with shields
[3:47:46] <%whyskeywolfe> the armor and weapon systems in this is so reminiscent of Stellaris with it's laser/kinetic/missile weapons and armor/shields setup
[3:47:47] <Sp3ctre48> Charging (when it works) kills everything on normal anyway so he's fine
[3:47:49] <%TheJaydedFox> TheJaydedFox subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months!

[3:50:37] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I forgot that the mechs don't have armor on lower difficulties
[3:50:39] <blackjack8182> Fight Harkin shirtless in the rain!
[3:50:40] <ioci2112> @Vantesla it's also good against armor, and stops krogan and vorcha from regenerating
[3:50:42] <Foopoof> wow that shotgun has an abysmal fire rate
[3:50:43] <ScreamLord> Unity heals
[3:50:44] <%jackelzxaa> me3's insanity is equal to me2's hardcore
[3:50:55] <DSD24> "I'm already half Harkin"
[3:50:55] <%ainzhelm> I just realized. Isn’t it weird that no enemy in the series does Charge?
[3:50:57] <%Daxalog> Are you saving super gun for look a like?
[3:50:58] <$hattrick61> Harkin got the recessive genes
[3:51:04] <+cylish> cylish subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 36 months! 
[3:51:06] <pilllowofbees> you gotta have a shirtless fight with him

[3:51:40] <+titansloth93> garrus do you even have a nose
[3:51:42] <Vantesla> @ioci2112 indeed. It isn't as high base to AP Ammo, but it's other benefits help in many fights vs AP or even Warp Ammo.

[3:51:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt do you have the upgrade guide?
[3:51:44] <%Daxalog> That was the X blade
[3:51:45] <blackjack8182> F
[3:51:46] <%jackelzxaa> pat looks at the upgrade notes "don't mess up the hacking prompt that has the one of a kind super upgrade in it or you'll never have all of them"
[3:51:48] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Fight Harkin shirtless on the top of Rresidium Tower
[3:51:56] <%StaceMcGate> Come out Ansem, I can smell you
[3:52:04] <%jackelzxaa> i don't think i've ever seen this game on normal
[3:52:12] <Profmcstevie> What ARE the upgrades in this mission anyhoo
[3:52:14] <%jackelzxaa> my first time was veteran and then i always do hardcore or insanity since
[3:52:17] <%dekkitout> @StaceMcGate Smells like boat
[3:52:17] <Foopoof> wowie 900 creds
[3:52:35] <peachy996> Batarians on the Citadel. Weird
[3:52:38] <%MugenSandan> Is Hawkins C H A O S ?
[3:52:40] <DSD24> That's another Batarian down
[3:52:40] <%Monkeyweed21> lol Pat forgot to look up the upgrades
[3:52:41] <peachy996> in 2 at least
[3:52:42] <%condemned_15> hey look! Shields!
[3:52:48] <Laecerelius> No reward quite like getting to kill Batarians!
[3:52:49] <Vikingincognito> The hacking dot are as follows: Drill/Zipper/Clappers/Copyright
[3:52:52] <ioci2112> @Vantesla yeah it's great against everything except synthetics, cryo ammo is actually pretty bad in higher difficulties, since everything has armor, barrier or shields
[3:52:53] <Foopoof> that's a pretty girthy gun ngl
[3:52:58] <%condemned_15> upgrade list, Pat?
[3:53:43] <%condemned_15> gotta buy space beer with my fake space IDs
[3:53:54] <%walternatorz> @PatStaresAt have you gotten the big mech to go nuclear yet?
[3:53:54] <DSD24> Yeah Tali drone putting in work
[3:53:59] <Vantesla> I wish NG+ in ME2 carried the upgrades. Given doing a NG+ on ME2 on Insanity makes things more difficult due to higher level and weaker weapons.
[3:54:10] <%jackelzxaa> pat if you shoot just the head off of a heavy mech it explodes like a nuke and kills everything in the room including other giant mechs
[3:54:52] <Vikingincognito> Man, I've been playing on veteran and thats a noticable step above normal. I cant even imagine Insanity

[3:55:39] <Hellarussian> very diplomatic
[3:55:40] <+Mr_Misanthropy> whoa garrus has a bluetooth
[3:55:41] <peachy996> I don't remember much of ME2 Insanity besides that Horizon/Derelict Collector Ship is tough
[3:55:49] <DSD24> Insanity is really fun
[3:55:53] <%Monkeyweed21> he's more anarchist than fascist
[3:55:53] <churropoppa> He's nice to ME and that's what counts
[3:55:54] <Vikingincognito> Pat stop making me like Garrus less. He was my favorite companion for years
[3:55:56] <%jackelzxaa> garrus is just the punisher
[3:55:58] <+senfood> To be fair, Harkin is a massive piece of shit.
[3:56:00] <peachy996> Spoooky Mech
[3:56:02] <%dekkitout> Garry, can we get some neosporin for your crusty face wound
[3:56:09] <%afronooch> @Vikingincognito its rough
[3:56:11] <Goraka91> I'll start with the fingernails
[3:56:19] <Vantesla> @vikingincognito Insanity isn't hard if familiar with the game and style of play. Sentinel makes things easy, If good at aiming Soldier or Infiltrator can easily kill fast in safety, and etc etc.
[3:56:26] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Oooo that clipping
[3:56:29] <$SGrim> Mega-super Fascist Garrus
[3:56:39] <peachy996> "I'll give him the bad suck."
[3:56:56] <Vikingincognito> The Derilict reaper is a massive fucking pain in the ass. I hate the huge armored sheild killer enmies
[3:56:59] <+Peacefrog7> Isnt Odo also pretty much a fascist too
[3:57:05] <ioci2112> me2 insanity is hard, but as long as you know what you're doing it's fine, except horizon and the collector ship, those can fuck right off
[3:57:06] <Josef_Stryker> It's fiiiiiiine
[3:57:07] <knight_verse> Garrus buddy, why you holding that rifle like a handgun?
[3:57:09] <%ainzhelm> Torture isn’t exclusive to fascism
[3:57:13] <$SGrim> Missed dialog DansGame
[3:57:18] <peachy996> Oh yeah the Derelict Reaper too
[3:57:24] <+AWKWARDL0SER> It took an eternity to find that terminal
[3:57:25] <tanarath> totes no punisher iconography on his armour
[3:57:36] <Foopoof> hackerman
[3:57:42] <%AncelDeLambert> it sure would be if you were an inflitrator
[3:57:42] <$QueequegTheater> @Peacefrog7 if you're using fascist as short hand for Dirty Harry-types, yes
[3:57:45] <peachy996> Basically the Scions+Husks are a bad time
[3:57:49] <%shadowsofpain> @peachy996 ah yes the derelict "reaper"
[3:58:03] <ratcobi> they have these big ass suits but no helmets?
[3:58:14] <ScreamLord> Pull doesn't work on shielded/armored units
[3:58:16] <%GarbageNirvana> @QueequegTheater I mean who do you think a lot of modern-day fascists idolize
[3:58:18] <peachy996> dead gods still dream is a money line
[3:58:19] <Vikingincognito> @peachy996 Excaptly the Scions coming in twos with a hrode of husks is just such a fucking annoying fight
[3:58:22] <Goraka91> Killing batarians never gets old
[3:58:29] <%jackelzxaa> optimal is melee after every shotgun blast
[3:58:29] <DSD24> That was a good read
[3:58:35] <DSD24> Ohhhhh crap
[3:58:45] <%ainzhelm> @queequegtheater So fascist just means Mean and violent now?
[3:58:48] <Vikingincognito> @peachy996 true
[3:58:51] <peachy996> You have a cain do you not?
[3:58:52] <$QueequegTheater> @GarbageNirvana Doesn't make the characters fascist. It's becoming a catch-all term for "mean authority I dislike"

[3:59:20] <tanarath> the nuke is fun
[3:59:20] <Vantesla> Still agitated that in this remaster they still couldn't put a helmet toggle in the ME2... Especially given it is reducing stats when not wearing one to just see Shepard's face...
[3:59:26] <intestinal_bleeding> "take this! platforms!"

[4:00:11] <%GarbageNirvana> Kill your clone Pat
[4:00:11] <%RetroCop87> HE EVEN HAS THE OPPOSITE COLOR SCHEME
[4:00:11] <+ygernesfeld> How will Garrus know which one is which?!
[4:00:12] <jorniev> THESE CUTSCENES WERE ALWAYS SO ACKWARD
[4:00:12] <Jaysky> I got a really hilarious glitch my first time around with this
[4:00:13] <+FlongBongle> LOOKS LIKE PAT
[4:00:13] <+EmptyMug> BROTHAS!

[4:00:22] <%shurtal> Pat likes the bald evil
[4:00:23] <%ainzhelm> @garbagenirvana Only if you are looking for a specific kind and ignoring other kinds
[4:00:24] <DSD24> Start beating his ass
[4:00:24] <+chester804> Pat is R[ing as Harkin for this LP
[4:00:26] <%Mattais88> Pat is Harkin's twin
[4:00:26] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> I looked back and wondered why garrus was beating you up
[4:00:28] <James_Quivers> YOU GOT ALL THE GOOD GENES, SHEPARD
[4:00:29] <+Mr_Misanthropy> Shepard stunt double
[4:00:30] <Vantesla> You have a twin Pat SeemsGood LUL
[4:00:30] <stantheman_97> FAKER? I THINK YOU'RE THE FAKE HERE
[4:00:30] <$hattrick61> Might controls everything Shepard
[4:00:31] <Jaysky> Garrus's model was a stretched Miranda
[4:00:31] <%dekkitout> He's taller, smarter, and has a bigger dick
[4:00:33] <tanarath> LEGIT PAT'S BROTHER HOLY SHIT
[4:00:34] <arkv01> belieb it
[4:00:35] <%bassoontyphoon> Is that David Cage
[4:00:36] <%OldOnyx> Just got here. Why is Garrus beating up Pat?
[4:00:36] <Grunkle_Dan_> you just look like a slightly more depresed Harkin
[4:00:37] <Profmcstevie> Vergil you bastard
[4:00:37] <%Cykron> I HAVE THE DOMINANT HAIRLINE
[4:00:37] <+RowenCleric> ITS NOT OVER YET SHEPARD
[4:00:38] <+senfood> He's a brunette instead of a ginger. Clearly, he's evil.
[4:00:40] <ovan20> Pat, help your brother Kappa
[4:00:44] <%jackelzxaa> the first human csec and the first human spectre are identical twins
[4:00:45] <ohno778> JIG IS UP BLUE PAT
[4:00:45] <Goatllama> WutFace
[4:00:46] <$QueequegTheater> @GarbageNirvana not really IMO, there's nothing inherently wrong with power fantasies in fiction, isn't that what harem anime are all about?
[4:00:46] <Dunmarkh> nice dick kick
[4:00:46] <peachy996> He's also a snitch
[4:00:46] <Vikingincognito> YEAH
[4:00:48] <Goraka91> I am the shadow, the true self
[4:00:50] <Vikingincognito> IN THE SAME SHOT
[4:00:50] <i_love_thicc_chicks> I can't tell the difference
[4:00:51] <peachy996> Or a Coward
[4:00:57] <ovan20> they are identical LUL
[4:00:58] <Jaysky> Did anyone else get the weird Garrus morph glitch for this in the original game?
[4:00:59] <%DashXero> Death is bad for business.
[4:01:00] <%king_wragles> I can't remember Harkin, can someone remind me?
[4:01:02] <peachy996> Wish that was me
[4:01:05] <%ainzhelm> @goraka91 Well I can tell you it’s certainly wishful thinking
[4:01:08] <Psyramics> remember that Garrus is the Good Guy in this situation
[4:01:09] <%StaceMcGate> Garrus interrogating Pat, 2009
[4:01:10] <Laecerelius> Garrus' big ol' duck feet
[4:01:15] <$SGrim> Totally not totalitarian Garrus
[4:01:16] <fluffy_sauce> is Harkin Shepard's brother?
[4:01:20] <%Monkeyweed21> @king_wragles scumbag C-Sec officer
[4:01:20] <%dekkitout> Turn down the vigilante mavrick, Garry
[4:01:21] <NeroInfinite> Good cop bad cop
[4:01:23] <%polothegreatest> garrus secretly hated u
[4:01:23] <$hattrick61> "Which one do i shoot?" - Tali
[4:01:24] <DSD24> @king_wragles He was that asshole C Sec dood in the the beginning of ME1
[4:01:25] <Vikingincognito> You can tell Pat's aromor is a ME3 model becuase its shiny in a different way than any of the ME2 armors
[4:01:27] <Foopoof> @fluffy_sauce yes
[4:01:33] <DSD24> Shoot him
[4:01:35] <$hattrick61> "both" garrus
[4:01:38] <%GarbageNirvana> @QueequegTheater Just sayin if someone starts modeling their life after that it can be troubling
[4:01:41] <intestinal_bleeding> "hmm, gun"
[4:01:43] <%jackelzxaa> "Garrus no, only i can kill in cutscenes."
[4:01:46] <Foopoof> dew it
[4:01:47] <Goraka91> @ainzhelm Yes, though I don't live in America so we don't have the same cop stuff going on
[4:01:47] <peachy996> Shoot the inferior Pat
[4:01:51] <$QueequegTheater> @GarbageNirvana fair enough
[4:01:59] <%dekkitout> Garry, no! Stop hovering over the ME3 green option!
[4:02:00] <%jackelzxaa> garrus wants to build his renegade points
[4:02:01] <Foopoof> shoot the crooked ex cop
[4:02:01] <Vikingincognito> There can only be one Pat
[4:02:02] <$QueequegTheater> DO IT
[4:02:06] <$QueequegTheater> KILL THAT BITCH
[4:02:06] <DarkJaguar124> Don't tempt him....
[4:02:08] <+tigerfang86> there's only room for ONE PAT in the NO PAT WORLD
[4:02:09] <DSD24> Let it happen!
[4:02:09] <akitanito> THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE PAT
[4:02:11] <%king_wragles> It actually SUPER IS
[4:02:18] <Sol_Install> worst pat versus better pat
[4:02:18] <DSD24> Aww
[4:02:19] <stantheman_97> pat didn't you kick a guy out a window?
[4:02:20] <+holsety5> shoulda let him shoot
[4:02:22] <ovan20> booooooooo
[4:02:23] <%DashXero> Why'd you stop him?!
[4:02:24] <Foopoof> NO
[4:02:26] <peachy996> pew
[4:02:26] <+Mr_Misanthropy> Make sure to call our mother and See ya next Christmas Harkin.
[4:02:26] <tuesti> why'd you stop him
[4:02:30] <%Cykron> LUL
[4:02:33] <%daemonazaezal> very krogan of you garrus
[4:02:34] <fullyradical> Man he really likes murder, you can see him nodding like a good when pulls out the pistol
[4:02:34] <%ainzhelm> @goraka91 Funny because if you want to be more literal with the term fascist, plenty of places worse than America
[4:02:34] <intestinal_bleeding> I CAN CHANGE HIM
[4:02:39] <tuesti> oh ok LUL
[4:02:40] <DSD24> Ok that's still good
[4:02:40] <%goose_attack_almanac> WHY DIDN'T THEY DETaiN HIM
[4:02:40] <ohno778> Why'd you stop him again?
[4:02:41] <%dekkitout> The headbutt hype is spreading on the Normandy
[4:02:41] <$QueequegTheater> That's fair
[4:02:42] <Dunmarkh> he angy
[4:02:43] <TioXyco> you don't need the points
[4:02:44] <fullyradical> *goof
[4:02:44] <%Bane_Kaikyo> NUMBER GO UP
[4:02:45] <%Puhff> jfc garrus
[4:02:46] <jorniev> I CAN CHANGE HIM
[4:02:48] <+DBTenno> ME2 doesn't penalize for doing both Paragon & Renegade?
[4:02:49] <+Peacefrog7> arent you full paragon already
[4:02:49] <$QueequegTheater> But he's cool
[4:02:50] <%Cykron> GARRUS IS A GOOD BOY
[4:02:51] <susukouhai> Garrus big kill big penis
[4:02:51] <ScreamLord> Number go up
[4:02:51] <%StaceMcGate> Pat doesn't want Garrus to hurt his avatar
[4:02:52] <stantheman_97> fair
[4:02:53] <%GarbageNirvana> I wish there more options that let you say "Don't shoot him! BECAUSE I WANT TO"
[4:02:53] <%jackelzxaa> they did lower the points requirements apparently, didn't they?
[4:02:55] <Holofono> LUL you're a loose cannon Garrus
[4:02:55] <%whyskeywolfe> Garrus is Pat's Zangief 2
[4:02:57] <ohno778> But it's good behavior
[4:02:57] <Vantesla> don't want to ruin the loyalty checks coming later
[4:03:00] <TurtlesAndTentacles> cause you look like him
[4:03:01] <%SwdVengeance> Roll up a newspaper and boop Garrus on the nose.
[4:03:01] <%goose_attack_almanac> THEY LET HIM GO?
[4:03:02] <+senfood> LITERAL SPACE PUNISHER
[4:03:02] <%jackelzxaa> oh did they fix the skybox glitch
[4:03:03] <+RowenCleric> punish me Garrus
[4:03:06] <+akscully> it's absolutely like him
[4:03:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> @ainzhelm Don't worry with president dixiecrat in office we'll get there soon
[4:03:10] <stantheman_97> it kinda is
[4:03:10] <blackjack8182> Revenge!
[4:03:15] <%sunsetdisc0> "you are a criminal therefore you deserve to be shot"
[4:03:15] <$SGrim> Make Garrus a good boy. Punish his poor choices, and reward his good ones.
[4:03:15] <T_Sasquatch> My an edgelord. Shepard
[4:03:17] <$Solid_Stro> Nah, Encourage It All the Way sabert14Gun
[4:03:17] <fullyradical> The animations are very undynamic
[4:03:21] <%ainzhelm> @dbtenno 3 does. With the choices. You get punished whenever you flip flop
[4:03:33] <$QueequegTheater> @doc_ock_rokc can we not
[4:03:34] <%Cykron> YEES
[4:03:39] <Goraka91> @ainzhelm Mm just people like to make things black and white
[4:03:40] <Jaysky> Yes Shepard. He does.
[4:03:43] <%daemonazaezal> @ainzhelm please stop trying to talk politics in pats gaming stream. Arguing about the definition of fascism isnt a thing to do here.
[4:03:46] <James_Quivers> This is why garrus is better on a renegade playthru, because paragon keeps trying to change him but it NEVER STICKS, so whatever
[4:03:46] <intestinal_bleeding> garrrus...
[4:03:47] <+Peacefrog7> if you block the shot does it ruin the loyalty
[4:03:48] <Laecerelius> But you wish you were me, Garrus
[4:03:49] <%Ranryu692> I just got here, did I miss the Kasumi mission?
[4:03:51] <Grunkle_Dan_> Injustice is okay, Garrus.
[4:03:52] <ohno778> UR TOO SOFT PAT
[4:03:52] <T_Sasquatch> It totally is him
[4:03:52] <thetunnelhomer> Why does it feel like it's on fast-foward?
[4:03:54] <%StaceMcGate> Shepard just wants that bird dick
[4:03:57] <+D00msDayDan> yeah he's more of a killer instinct guy
[4:04:01] <%jackelzxaa> garrus is all about that justice dick
[4:04:05] <nuane> What if the punisher was a space bird?
[4:04:07] <Jaysky> @Peacefrog7 I'm pretty sure it does actually
[4:04:09] <%daemonazaezal> You need high paragon to not lose loyalty
[4:04:09] <viewtifulr> just let him get his nut off shepard, your already fucking tali next to him on the guns no less
[4:04:11] <romc215> Are you going to at least let Garrus get his revenge?
[4:04:15] <%jackelzxaa> tali is here too
[4:04:16] <+vaderxyz1970> Is Garrus becoming the punisher?
[4:04:19] <Goraka91> Tali: Yo the fuck
[4:04:19] <Grunkle_Dan_> Garrus is like two steps away from declaring he is the night
[4:04:24] <nuane> Tali's playing games on her phone
[4:04:24] <%Cykron> Tali just wants a nice date with Shepard
[4:04:26] <blackjack8182> Revenge!
[4:04:26] <ScreamLord> For moral support
[4:04:27] <%jackelzxaa> tali didnt say anything the whole mission
[4:04:28] <%AncelDeLambert> I do like how this one ends
[4:04:29] <Laecerelius> Oh yeah, hotness is also along for the ride
[4:04:30] <tuesti> LUL
[4:04:36] <%jackelzxaa> garrus isn't fascist he's just edgy vigilante
[4:04:37] <romc215> Garrus IS the night!
[4:04:37] <akitanito> punpun garrus-chan
[4:04:37] <DSD24> Talking to the traitor first then letting Garrus kill him is really good
[4:04:39] <%condemned_15> Tali nervous as fuck
[4:04:42] <ohno778> Tali's in the back like WTF is going on?
[4:04:43] <BlueLunecy> Tali's in the back fantasizing about that threesome with Shep and Garrus
[4:04:46] <$QueequegTheater> @Peacefrog7 you have to convince him not to shoot
[4:04:46] <ExpressNode> I forgot Tali was there she has said nother
[4:04:47] <T_Sasquatch> Garrus became the Punisher the moment he became Archangel
[4:04:47] <%Ranryu692> there's a conversation in ME3 where Garrus brags about being Archangel and I just cracked up imagining Frank Castle bragging about being the Punisher
[4:04:48] <%jackelzxaa> garrus just pulls renegate interupts
[4:04:52] <Vantesla> be funny if Garrus was so messed up even if Shep got in the way he still fires and kills both LUL
[4:04:55] <+titansloth93> Tali was in the trunk
[4:04:58] <+holsety5> his range finder doesnt work
[4:04:58] <%Ranryu692> there is
[4:04:58] <%jackelzxaa> yes you can pat
[4:04:59] <thetunnelhomer> You can do both
[4:05:00] <tanarath> @vaderxyz1970 no, he's stanning him like cops do, which is legit NOT becoming him.
[4:05:00] <%AncelDeLambert> ... yes?
[4:05:00] <+RyanTheRecluse> you can
[4:05:01] <ioci2112> yes

[4:05:04] <jorniev> PARAGON
[4:05:04] <%jackelzxaa> garrus's loyalty isn't up for grabs

[4:05:05] <%StormBuster24> You can
[4:05:05] <+EmptyMug> Yes there is
[4:05:05] <+Peacefrog7> i was just asking that
[4:05:05] <+critikal_bit> There is

[4:05:05] <peachy996> Yes you can
[4:05:06] <%AncelDeLambert> you make Sidonis tolk
[4:05:06] <$QueequegTheater> You can
[4:05:06] <%ainzhelm> @daemonazaezal Sorry I will limit the politics to self affirming jokes like everyone else
[4:05:06] <Goraka91> Paragon that shit
[4:05:07] <romc215> I think there is a paragon speech check
[4:05:07] <Josef_Stryker> Nah you keep his loyalty regardless
[4:05:07] <+ygernesfeld> yes
[4:05:07] <LockingKey> i'm pretty sure you can
[4:05:07] <%miguelrod777> yeah there is
[4:05:08] <Arweynn> i think so?
[4:05:08] <+OG_M_Bison> You get his loyalty if you spare Sidonis @PatStaresAt

[4:05:08] <%Ranryu692> just be paragon lol
[4:05:08] <%daemonazaezal> it can be done
[4:05:09] <Virokwet> what you mean
[4:05:09] <%SwdVengeance> Totally
[4:05:09] <%jackelzxaa> finishing the mission at all makes garrus loyal
[4:05:09] <TechDragon_Z> You keep his loyalty no matter the outcome
[4:05:10] <+FennecZephyr> No, you can totally keep his loyalty
[4:05:10] <%charp35> There is
[4:05:11] <%mikeriffic> Just pargon spam
[4:05:11] <$QueequegTheater> Blue options
[4:05:11] <+D00msDayDan> garrus spends all day calibrating his shit but the fuckin rangefinder on his sniper scope doesn't work
[4:05:11] <T_Sasquatch> Why save this peace of shit tho
[4:05:11] <ohno778> LET HIM KILL HIM
[4:05:12] <%daemonazaezal> PARAGON
[4:05:12] <holyxgrale> You get loyalty just for doing the mission im pretty sure
[4:05:13] <Vantesla> I've always saved him and kept loyalty....
[4:05:13] <thetunnelhomer> Just pass the checks

[4:05:22] <ioci2112> finishing the mission makes him loyal
[4:05:22] <akitanito> your bald head is blocking the way
[4:05:23] <%Cykron> HIS BALD HEAD
[4:05:24] <blackjack8182> Kill him tho

[4:07:00] <romc215> Lame
[4:07:02] <T_Sasquatch> Ok that's not fair. I thought sidonis was evi
[4:07:04] <ioci2112> @jackelzxaa they lowered the requirements in LE, also morality is weird in me2, it's based on the amount of paragon or renegade points you got based on the amount that was available to you up to that point in the game, so if you have 160 paragon, and the game made 200 available to you, and a check requires 90%, you're fucked
[4:07:07] <%DJFakie> DJFakie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Late saying this but that Jaffe dunk was sick and you're a swell guy for that donation. Here's to another six months
[4:07:07] <trianglehat> Sidonis nuts
[4:07:07] <Gorshum> Talk no jutsu so strong!
[4:07:08] <%ape_hawk> no he wont

[4:07:13] <blackjack8182> How did he pay for his crime?
[4:07:14] <ovan20> that went from 100 to 0 in 2 seconds D:
[4:07:16] <Zalapski> booooo

[4:07:17] <%Cykron> Sidonis just fucks off
[4:07:18] <$lumporr> POW
[4:07:19] <DSD24> I like letting him die after you talk to him
[4:07:20] <$SGrim> LOYALTY GAINED
[4:07:25] <peachy996> He kind of does in ME3
[4:07:28] <TheQuadrupleS> LAAAME
[4:07:30] <$Solid_Stro> Wow, I always let him die, I’ve never seen this option c4sageLUL c4sageLUL c4sageLUL
[4:07:31] <%condemned_15> BANG
[4:07:32] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt btw the Blue Suns tortured the shit out of him to get him to betray them
[4:07:33] <%Cykron> Is it?
[4:07:36] <Ravioli_Ronin> He really got off by being TOO pathetic to kill
[4:07:37] <%bassoontyphoon> Boooooo
[4:07:37] <blackjack8182> Lame
[4:07:40] <ovan20> @blackjack8182 he feels bad...so it's ok Keepo
[4:07:41] <%RubberFistFight> @jackelzxaa it wasn't difficult in the first place, so lowering the requirement really didn't make much difference OR sense.
[4:07:42] <%kyh9> "His conscience is his punishment" is the dumbest shit
[4:07:43] <$lumporr> loyalty?
[4:07:44] <romc215> Weakness
[4:07:54] <%jackelzxaa> if you let garrus take the shot after sidonis confesses his nightmares, sidonis thanks shepard
[4:07:55] <holyxgrale> BS yea he coulda done it
[4:07:56] <%Cykron> No he couldn't
[4:08:00] <Laecerelius> You were fucking chomping at the bit, Garrus
[4:08:00] <viewtifulr> garres denied his murder nut - how could you
[4:08:03] <+FlongBongle> True
[4:08:04] <Goraka91> LUL
[4:08:04] <akitanito> you were only looking at pat's bald head tho
[4:08:08] <T_Sasquatch> There's bitch in your heart ,Garrus
[4:08:09] <Dame_90> Nope
[4:08:09] <tuesti> LMAO
[4:08:10] <blackjack8182> Weak
[4:08:10] <DSD24> @jackelzxaa Yep that's why I like that version
[4:08:11] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[4:08:12] <$Solid_Stro> Guilt Isn’t Enough coxRee
[4:08:14] <Hellarussian> Shepard is terrible at giving advice
[4:08:15] <+xerotwo> LUL
[4:08:15] <%Cykron> Fucking flaccid
[4:08:15] <ovan20> there's still good on the guy that killed his entire crew LUL
[4:08:16] <tanarath> @blackjack8182 by literally losing all of his joy & anything good in his life? By having nightmares of those he killed haunting himself?
[4:08:17] <Latija> garrus' insticts are to kill people in cold blood
[4:08:19] <Holofono> "kill them all garrus"
[4:08:19] <+xerotwo> OOP AHH! LUL
[4:08:21] <%ape_hawk> such a quickie
[4:08:21] <$lumporr> his instincts are "kill criminals on sight"
[4:08:21] <romc215> Super lameness
[4:08:21] <ScreamLord> "Generic uplifting speech."
[4:08:27] <peachy996> I think Sidonis helps Csec defend the Citadel during the coup in 3
[4:08:31] <mak0t0yukii> I mean you were dead for like years
[4:08:33] <+doc_ock_rokc> my kitty hawk heart is full of bitch
[4:08:33] <stantheman_97> garrus' instincts tell him to shoot when someone is holding a hostage
[4:08:34] <%Ranryu692> Garrus gets so close to figuring out that he's wrong, but he never quite gets there
[4:08:35] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> You picked it.
[4:08:35] <ioci2112> @jackelzxaa yeah I know, I never failed it either way, but some people did, that's why they lowered it, since ME2 morality is wack and some people couldn't do it even if their bars looked full
[4:08:38] <holyxgrale> I was mad as hell that he doesn't mention gray if you let him shoot after getting his whole spiel
[4:08:39] <%OrangeMDT> That was dumb. Should’ve killed super hard
[4:08:40] <thetunnelhomer> Huh. This was way lamer than I remember.
[4:08:42] <%shadowsofpain> time to talk with him, Kasumi, and zaeed
[4:08:45] <%Cykron> Yes let the murderer go cause he feels real bad
[4:08:45] <%jackelzxaa> theres a special dialog about elevators if you walk up and down the stairs with garrus and tali on the citadel, pat
[4:08:46] <tuesti> Shepard: Cheer up buddy
[4:08:47] <%MugenSandan> but not his bedroom ones and that's ALL THAT MATTERS
[4:08:51] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt btw it can come up later but the Blue Suns tortured the SHIT out of Sidonis
[4:08:52] <tanarath> FEED FISH
[4:08:53] <peachy996> Finish with a dumb sidemission
[4:09:00] <nuane> Why do they even have second team members on loyalty missons
[4:09:05] <+PenmanLupine> Darg got his Krussy
[4:09:07] <+tigerfang86> awwwwwwwww yeah
[4:09:07] <%Cykron> He has his own harem now
[4:09:09] <+D00msDayDan> man krogans really love talking about their balls
[4:09:11] <Latija> sigma male krogan
[4:09:12] <Ravioli_Ronin> The fact that doing these missions like this raises your camaraderie with your crew, and doesn’t lower it, is wild
[4:09:12] <DarkJaguar124> I think Kelly's feeding the fish now.
[4:09:13] <romc215> Your shepard is such a dork!
[4:09:13] <%MidnightBurst12> hell yeah

[4:09:17] <%kyh9> Did Pat do Zaeed's loyalty mission yet?
[4:09:20] <%dekkitout> He got his dick(?) wet PogChamp
[4:09:21] <%jackelzxaa> i kinda wish that getting no deaths in the suicide mission was difficult and required you to give up something else to get it
[4:09:27] <%Cykron> Krogan Male Vitality
[4:09:27] <stantheman_97> darg got mad pussy
[4:09:33] <+vaderxyz1970> You redpilled that Krogan

[4:13:42] <+RowenCleric> why is Pat yelling at Paige now!?
[4:13:43] <Laecerelius> Pat's a buff baby who can dance like a man! He can shake-a his fanny, he can shake-a his can!
[4:13:44] <xcompleasedad> It's for teenagers
[4:13:44] <willsin4fun> oo so child mode
[4:13:45] <tanarath> Veteran/Heroic is normal
[4:13:45] <ioci2112> normal is baby mode, easy is dumb baby mode
[4:13:48] <%ItalianWaifu> more like easy and "Tell me a story mode"
[4:13:48] <knight_verse> So Bitch mode then?
[4:13:50] <+akscully> need the crusts cut off your sandwich, pat?
[4:13:55] <blackjack8182> Baby mode is normal
[4:13:57] <%kyh9> Veteran and Heroic are the only modes worth playing
[4:13:57] <%Arancet> baby pat
[4:13:57] <akitanito> what is that
[4:13:58] <%crazyspartan214> normal mode is baby mode for you Pat
[4:13:59] <%DorianCreed> Normal IS for babies
[4:14:00] <Vantesla> Pat @mikeriffic Shredder I believe has reduced vs synthetic and it only effects health. many enemies that are difficult have armor so AP is better. Also some enemies have no HP and just Armor.
[4:14:02] <$QueequegTheater> Fucken nice
[4:14:03] <akitanito> is paige preggo now
[4:14:03] <romc215> Normal is baby mode. Insanity is where the men fight
[4:14:05] <Grunkle_Dan_> hey Pat, do you still have Baby Ashley?
[4:14:05] <%Ranryu692> what is it?
[4:14:07] <%shurtal> was pat just fed baby food?
[4:14:07] <%king_wragles> What was it?
[4:14:09] <%justcallmebobplease> THAT IS GOOD LEMONADE
[4:14:12] <Tracazoid> Pat's playing on I'm Too Young to Die difficulty
[4:14:12] <arkv01> preggors...
[4:14:12] <%Arancet> here comes the airplane
[4:14:12] <%dekkitout> *He eats as he says he's not on baby mode
[4:14:13] <NeroInfinite> Is it a durian?
[4:14:18] <+TheBitingIrish> What is it?
[4:14:19] <Zeif00> say the name say the name
[4:14:19] <%Monkeyweed21> Easy is sucking on the teat, Normal is the baby food stage
[4:14:20] <%greencapps> what is it
[4:14:24] <%Ranryu692> passion fruit is great
[4:14:26] <+D00msDayDan> time to SIIIIIING
[4:14:39] <blackjack8182> Normal is way to easy in this
[4:14:46] <NeroInfinite> ah good ol posion
[4:14:49] <%Ranryu692> passion fruit isn't sour, it's tart
[4:14:53] <ioci2112> veteran is normal people mode, hardcore is big dick mode, insanity is dick so big you trip over it and die over and over
[4:14:56] <willyfreshness> Paige needs a "pineapple bad" tattoo on her hand
[4:15:03] <%mikeriffic> @Vantesla True, but in my recent insanity run, shredder completly destroyed in the collector base. Killed Collectors Health bar with like 2 shots with the Mattock
[4:15:13] <%mikeriffic> It has its place
[4:15:14] <%AncelDeLambert> TELL ME MORE, MORDIN, THAT SOUNDS HYPE
[4:15:21] <%Arancet> theyre totally cool to shoot
[4:15:21] <%mikeriffic> Oh i forgot
[4:15:23] <%kyh9> ME3 Multiplayer would like to disagree
[4:15:25] <%Dakuu75> "a fate worse than death"
[4:15:27] <%AncelDeLambert> my organs kinda suck, can I have new ones of tech?
[4:15:28] <%StaceMcGate> ITS COMING CHAT
[4:15:33] <%StaceMcGate> ASK ABOUT ART
[4:15:33] <%mikeriffic> You can just spec squad for "Squad ammo"
[4:15:37] <%kyh9> Reawakened Collector in ME3 was fucking great to play as
[4:15:39] <JetpackMcQuack> :)
[4:15:40] <%GinAndRoses> technosoul tell me more
[4:15:41] <%mikeriffic> SO id just bring thane and activate shredder ammo
[4:15:42] <%jackelzxaa> normal disables alot of mechanics in each game
[4:15:43] <$SGrim> Now he cares about plagues
[4:15:43] <peachy996> We never get Salarian equivalent to Husks sadly
[4:15:46] <%mikeriffic> thats what I did, didnt spec it
[4:15:51] <Vantesla> @mikeriffic to be fair Mattock is choice if using Assault Rifle. it's so good SeemsGood
[4:15:59] <wolverinewaswrong> The reapers really are fucked
[4:16:00] <peachy996> I bet they would have been like Keepers or for combat Geth Hoppers
[4:16:03] <DarkJaguar124> Has anyone ever noticed Mordin's markings on his head looks like a reaper?
[4:16:08] <trianglehat> no don't stop
[4:16:14] <%shadowsofpain> @kyh9 Man the awakened Collectors where amazing
[4:16:19] <%Arancet> oh god they ARE the hybrid organiz/tech that ME3 praises as ultimate form

[4:16:38] <ohno778> Smacking intensifies
[4:16:42] <%dekkitout> This is that prime directive thing, right?
[4:16:42] <%kyh9> @shadowsofpain The Biotic Swarm ability was next level. Almost as fun as the Batarian Vanguards

[4:29:35] <Alzero83> James Bond time
[4:29:36] <+senfood> His South African accent is fantastic.
[4:29:37] <+akscully> just try to identify hock's accent
[4:29:39] <mr_sups> What is that Accent
[4:29:41] <jorniev> SARYN STATUE?
[4:29:45] <+AWKWARDL0SER> Kasumi’s DLC is a godsend for Sential and Biotic play throughs due to the SMG
[4:29:46] <%AncelDeLambert> this is a terrible accent
[4:29:47] <%Garthunox> He's South African
[4:29:48] <$QueequegTheater> Why can't he decide whether he's Scottish or English
[4:29:50] <DSD24> There's the Geth Arm
[4:29:52] <Goraka91> Fookin' prawns
[4:29:54] <%condemned_15> I've studied all your moves Sonya
[4:29:59] <%NopeBadguy> isn't shepard a galactically recognized war hero @PatStaresAt
[4:30:00] <%AncelDeLambert> CROIKY DINGO
[4:30:00] <%RubberFistFight> It's an Afrikaans/South African accent, guys
[4:30:01] <%slimmixrp> What fuckin accent is this
[4:30:02] <James_Quivers> NO ASIANS
[4:30:07] <%RubberFistFight> a strong one
[4:30:07] <%CalderGaming> BIG Afrikaans
[4:30:10] <+D00msDayDan> @QueequegTheater south african accent do be like that
[4:30:10] <DSD24> I don't like Hoodies Gunn
[4:30:11] <$QueequegTheater> Half that sentence sounded Russian
[4:30:11] <tuesti> WHY
[4:30:13] <CollinsOfBodom> It's Texan
[4:30:14] <%Ranryu692> she IS dressed like a thief
[4:30:18] <peachy996> Also a merc outfit that's not the big 3
[4:30:19] <ohno778> Ok then
[4:30:19] <%polothegreatest> uff no handshake
[4:30:19] <%Cykron> Maybe the cat suit gave her away
[4:30:21] <%RubberFistFight> @slimmixrp south african, multiple people have said it already
[4:30:23] <%Ranryu692> bald guys all look the same
[4:30:23] <%polothegreatest> rude
[4:30:25] <akitanito> his face is slightly different
[4:30:27] <%jackelzxaa> i think the implication is that impersonating people in the future isn't that rare
[4:30:27] <peachy996> Nah man this is Harkin
[4:30:27] <%Tman451> No, his shirt is
[4:30:27] <jorniev> SUPERMAN EFFECT
[4:30:28] <seniormeatbox> I hear southern, french, australian, and british
[4:30:28] <Dunmarkh> shepard is also dead
[4:30:28] <Admiral_PopnFresh> South African? took me as Irish
[4:30:28] <tuesti> but she's dressed LIKE THAAT
[4:30:33] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL yeah this mission is more than a little silly once you start asking lore questions
[4:30:34] <+doc_ock_rokc> its not texan
[4:30:37] <Spartan3909> Is he here to hunt for booty, mark?
[4:30:38] <%brisk_dacat> Gief is barking up a storm
[4:30:38] <%Garthunox> Guys its south african, just cos its not american doesnt mean its european
[4:30:42] <knight_verse> A legally dead hero.
[4:30:42] <Foopoof> probably thinks youre harkin
[4:30:42] <Minorou> invisiblessed
[4:30:43] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> But he's not a galactically recognized war hero in that coat.
[4:30:45] <peachy996> That Shepherd has a cool beard
[4:30:45] <$QueequegTheater> @tuesti she's a bodyguard
[4:30:45] <%rockcentuar> he is also dead
[4:30:46] <%AncelDeLambert> NO-ONE SAW THAT, SHUT UP
[4:30:46] <%shadowsofpain> a lot of people don't recognize from a glance
[4:30:48] <$Solid_Stro> He could just be Harkin too Kappa
[4:30:52] <+AWKWARDL0SER> This reminds me of Red Dead 2’s in story shitty disguises that backfire that the player has no control over
[4:30:53] <Latija> and nobody saw her turn invisible
[4:30:53] <ohno778> Why didnt she dress up?
[4:30:56] <$PhantomMiG> I mean we have seen shepard clones
[4:31:00] <peachy996> I don't see a good beard on this guy, completely different person
[4:31:01] <blackjack8182> Looks like Harkin
[4:31:01] <Goraka91> To be fair, Afrikaans are like Dutch
[4:31:04] <akitanito> can't leave
[4:31:05] <%Cykron> THE HARKIN EVERYWHERE SYSTEM
[4:31:05] <+doc_ock_rokc> He is a galactically recognized war hero who is dead
[4:31:06] <NitronStreams> *turn invisible in plain sight of everyone*
[4:31:13] <jorniev> OF COURSE NO ONE SAW THAT SHE TURNED INVISIBLE DUH
[4:31:15] <%AncelDeLambert> *6 million dollar man theme plays*
[4:31:15] <$QueequegTheater> @PhantomMiG that's a Citadel spoiler
[4:31:17] <%DianaTheAscian> is Pat doing the dlc blind?
[4:31:21] <$QueequegTheater> LUL

[5:14:51] <Archmortal> that's her life now. Staring into VR
[5:14:51] <+akscully> turned her into a drell, reliving past memories
[5:14:52] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt consider respeccing kasumi for flashbang because it'll stun even harbinger
[5:14:52] <peachy996> And now you're wearing this dumb suit
[5:14:53] <tattleworm> the really fucked up part is if you do synthesis with her keeping the graybox

[5:15:10] <%jackelzxaa> salarian prince scammer
[5:15:11] <Zalapski> OK, that's a good point
[5:15:12] <%Puffen0> @PatStaresAt two shots at the final boss with the cain kills it

[5:20:55] <%afronooch> i was down for a day with mild symptoms
[5:20:55] <+EmptyMug> Sore arm and fever
[5:20:56] <silver_stout> did it suck the first time?
[5:20:56] <%CalderGaming> I have no idea
[5:20:56] <NeroInfinite> 50/50
[5:20:56] <%GinAndRoses> ehhhhh fair chance
[5:20:56] <%peyodogo> who knows
[5:20:56] <+xerotwo> OOP AHH
[5:20:57] <%shadowsofpain> depends on the brand
[5:20:57] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> @patstaresat I was totally fine. just slept in
[5:20:57] <%greencapps> high
[5:20:57] <CrypticMochi> You might get a fever and sore arm
[5:20:57] <MildMannered_Creighton> 25ish
[5:20:57] <+Holmesith> how bad was the first
[5:20:58] <time2getsweaty> the first was worse then the second for me
[5:20:58] <RueOrin> Felt like the flu the next day, then got better on the third
[5:20:58] <Dunmarkh> waynerPiss
[5:20:59] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt Yeah got my second Pfizer friday of last week. Side effects i had were minimal, just a really sore arm for 6hrs, and some headachey lethargy the next day.
[5:20:59] <%mikeriffic> I just became drowsy
[5:20:59] <%shurtal> I was a little nausous, had a small headache, but EVERYONE reacts differently @PatStaresAt
[5:21:00] <DefaultSettiings> it varies person to person, but assume kinda rough
[5:21:00] <Jolly_Adventurer> @PatStaresAt I literally didnt feel anything
[5:21:00] <Profmcstevie> You wanna risk it and ruin woolies schedule as well??
[5:21:01] <DracaenaLeaf> the second pfizer shot hits after 12 hours
[5:21:01] <%MidnightBurst12> ymmv
[5:21:01] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt Make sure to shake your arm and you should be fine
[5:21:01] <%mikeriffic> Took naps
[5:21:02] <doggieo> Flip a coin
[5:21:02] <+kullumanati> Kinda
[5:21:02] <Psyramics> My arm hurt for a few days and thats it
[5:21:03] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I WAS FUCKED FOR 5 DAYS
[5:21:03] <+xerotwo> OOP AHH! doodStare
[5:21:03] <%heartlesshealer> Just don't raise arm above shoulder
[5:21:04] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt Personally second shot was easier
[5:21:04] <%strakillias> 90% of atleast a mild headache
[5:21:04] <%NateyBeak> it huts the next day for sure
[5:21:05] <fullyradical> It’ll be rough
[5:21:05] <%SaiyanShoto> Depends on you, I was fucked up the next day but my sister was completely fine
[5:21:05] <%bhp_99> How was the first one?
[5:21:05] <knight_verse> Pretty likely
[5:21:05] <%jackelzxaa> i fell asleep all next day when i got my second shot
[5:21:06] <Jaysky> Which one though @PatStaresAt
[5:21:07] <+xerotwo> OOP AHH doodStare
[5:21:07] <%brisk_dacat> Slim
[5:21:07] <Vantesla> that is a random variable
[5:21:07] <%Kharinite> 50/50
[5:21:08] <GustauveVIII> you'll feel pretty bad but the fever only lasts a day (at least for me)
[5:21:08] <%maskofmichael> Ask Paige
[5:21:09] <%SwdVengeance> I had 100+ fever for a day
[5:21:09] <churropoppa> I heard the second one knocks people out
[5:21:09] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt SOME PEOPLE FEEL NOTHING, DON'T JUST READ THE NEGATIVES
[5:21:09] <+xerotwo> OOP AHH! doodStare
[5:21:10] <Ravioli_Ronin> Depends, but it fucks a lot of people
[5:21:10] <satans_finest_millennial> if the last one rocked you, worse?
[5:21:10] <%tank7013> Depends on how well you can cast with arm pain and a (probably light) headache
[5:21:10] <%peyodogo> 50 50 tbh
[5:21:12] <%justcallmebobplease> YOUR SUFFERING IS MARKETABLE, IT'S FINE
[5:21:13] <Estuko> I was good for day 1 post shot, then day 2 I got hit and slammed into my door after getting up because my body said no
[5:21:13] <+kullumanati> About a day
[5:21:14] <+xerotwo> OOP AHH doodStare
[5:21:15] <%Kharinite> I was fine
[5:21:16] <fullyradical> It wiped me out
[5:21:16] <+RaveBV> Which one, Pat? Depending on the shot it's either whatever or "fuck"
[5:21:18] <NeroInfinite> I was fucked for like a day.
[5:21:18] <%ElkRiverDog> I had a hellish headache and was sore as a kicked dog
[5:21:20] <Hanzmolman> Did u get symptoms from the first one?
[5:21:20] <vile_brand> dont forget to rub your arm
[5:21:21] <%Ranryu692> do Tuesday to be safe, but you'll probably be fine
[5:21:21] <%robotoken> 1st one made me sleepy and the second one did nothing
[5:21:22] <+akscully> it was over in 24 hours for me but it took me out the next day
[5:21:23] <%shadowsofpain> when are you getting it?
[5:21:25] <%Tman451> might be a no camera podcast
[5:21:25] <firewhiskeys> i was mostly just exhausted
[5:21:26] <Dame_90> 30% If you get Pfizer @Patstaresat
[5:21:28] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt just stretch the arm for about 20 minutes after the needle, and you'll be fine.
[5:21:30] <susukouhai> but tbf its also paige
[5:21:30] <%SveriSageAdvice> yeah Tuesday would be for the best
[5:21:31] <%animaturgy> If it gets you like it did me, you'll be out for a day and groggy the day after.
[5:21:34] <%GabeSweetMan> I was down for a week after #2.
[5:21:35] <Ravioli_Ronin> Covid vaxx comming for that Pat Bussy
[5:21:35] <%AncelDeLambert> PFP
[5:21:35] <%42nfl19> i just slept through the day, but srs affects ppl different
[5:21:36] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat About 24 hours after the shot is when people typically find out. coukd be full flu like symptoms, coukd be full sleepy times. I slept for 18 hours after mine.
[5:21:37] <%kortin> Neither of the vaccines were hugely sick-ing for me, they just made me tire
[5:21:37] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Everyone seems to react differently to it
[5:21:39] <%bread_assassin> I was ALSO fucked by my second shot.
[5:21:39] <%AgniBrandt> I know some folks who had no symptoms and some that felt like they were dying. I had considerable nausea and a massive headache the day after
[5:21:40] <wibbwobbler> 2nd dose is more fucky
[5:21:42] <+ScrapKingKeita> ONE JOKE
[5:21:42] <+xerotwo> LUL
[5:21:45] <%bhp_99> Didn’t have a lot of symptoms for first, same for 2nd
[5:21:48] <$realm_forge> You might feel shitty for a day or 2 but it shouldn’t be terrible
[5:21:51] <%DianaTheAscian> I don't get it
[5:21:56] <stantheman_97> wendys is good here too
[5:21:58] <peachy996> It's not THAT low
[5:21:58] <arkv01> wendys uses real grilled patties bb
[5:21:58] <%Cykron> IT's the same believe me
[5:21:59] <Archmortal> 2nd shot kicked my ass yeah
[5:22:00] <Jaysky> Wendy's has frostys.
[5:22:00] <%brisk_dacat> I’d love some nuggets
[5:22:03] <%DianaTheAscian> I like wendys
[5:22:04] <satans_finest_millennial> it do. baconator bitch
[5:22:06] <TurtlesAndTentacles> WENDY'S IS NOT LOW. WHOEVER SAID THAT IS AN IDIOT
[5:22:08] <Vantesla> depends on the person, the vaccine type, and reaction to it. It can be nothing to moderate to why do I feel like sht
[5:22:09] <%Kharinite> Wendy is amazing
[5:22:09] <Profmcstevie> Regional differences are significant depending
[5:22:09] <$QueequegTheater> It's better than BK or McDonalds, but still low tier
[5:22:14] <%joodatious> wendies is one of the few fast food places that doesn't make you feel like shit
[5:22:15] <%Puhff> it is not low at all
[5:22:15] <tattleworm> unless you do the thing
[5:22:16] <Jaysky> Also of fast food places their burgers are great
[5:22:17] <NeroInfinite> >REAL G RILELD PATTIEs
[5:22:19] <fullyradical> Our fast food is different
[5:22:22] <%Puhff> who is this insane person?
[5:22:22] <NeroInfinite> That shit is square my dude
[5:22:23] <%shadowsofpain> Wendy's is better than all McDonald's or burger King in the states
[5:22:27] <%Kharinite> Wendy's is not low in the hiearchy
[5:22:29] <Jaysky> And also I thought Wendy's is like one of the top places now?
[5:22:30] <churropoppa> Wendy's is top tier and if you think otherwise you're probably and ashley simp
[5:22:35] <%SinnerEbru> i literally just ate wendys
[5:22:36] <%Kharinite> How dare that one guy
[5:22:38] <Ravioli_Ronin> Canada actually has standards for what food qualifies for human consumption; The US does not
[5:22:38] <peachy996> Wrex in 3 if you sabotage the cure: "I know what you did."
[5:22:39] <%Ranryu692> that's entry-level mind goblins
[5:22:41] <$QueequegTheater> Cait Sith
[5:22:44] <%tank7013> A lot of games used to literally do that though
[5:22:45] <Profmcstevie> Yes because it's flavour text if it's not important NPC talk
[5:22:50] <%kyh9> Y'shtola???
[5:22:54] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Cait Sith in the alliance raids
[5:22:55] <DefaultSettiings> you broke pat
[5:22:55] <%heartlesshealer> hmm
[5:22:56] <%DianaTheAscian> Cait sith
[5:22:56] <Archmortal> @churropoppa it's funny cuz Ashley would love the Wendy's owner
[5:22:57] <%kyh9> Y'shtola is weird but she isn't spooky

[5:23:32] <Vantesla> Wendy's near me both places gone down last few years so avoid the chain. Mind same with McDonald's or Burger King... They all suck to me LUL
[5:23:41] <%JoshManVGH> Wait, is that how Cait Sith is properly pronounced!?
[5:23:44] <$QueequegTheater> Fat Black Chocobo
[5:23:46] <iosephe> OH YEAH THIS
[5:23:51] <$QueequegTheater> @JoshManVGH yes
[5:23:52] <Ravioli_Ronin> Taco Bell wasn’t allowed to open in Canada for a bit, because their beef wasn’t deemed fit for human consumption

[5:24:01] <%shadowsofpain> new promotion
[5:24:04] <theshillman> chikun
[5:24:06] <%animaturgy> It was easy to get a few years back
[5:24:10] <NeroInfinite> new promo
[5:24:11] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt They're doing a twitch promotion event for it but it's only for a couple streamers
[5:24:16] <%justcallmebobplease> Fat Black Chocobo was from the food promotional that was a family 4-meal
[5:24:18] <%justcallmebobplease> Right?
[5:24:19] <iosephe> New promotion for it requires you to gift subs to specific streamers
[5:24:20] <A0N33> FFXIV and Twitch are doing a thing right now where you gift 4 subs to certain, specific streamers and get the fat black chocobo
[5:24:21] <%joodatious> more mounts should be tied to weird cross promotions and challenges
[5:24:25] <$QueequegTheater> The gift sub things
[5:24:26] <%DianaTheAscian> they made a new promotion
[5:24:30] <Vantesla> @ravioli_ronin They aren't even considered meat in USA LUL
[5:24:35] <Jaysky> I mean if I had to eat fast food I'd go for Wendy's for a burger. But there's much better.
[5:24:45] <$realm_forge> The girthiest chocobo
[5:24:49] <%GabeSweetMan> Why do it like that?!?!
[5:24:56] <%DianaTheAscian> I wish I could just give Pat money
[5:25:01] <%JoshManVGH> What why?
[5:25:02] <$QueequegTheater> You can but it has to be one at a time, he has a weird setup
[5:25:02] <%bread_assassin> You can turn off gift subs?
[5:25:03] <%NateyBeak> yea, jesse has lifetime subs turned on
[5:25:06] <+ThunderZebraKing> You can make it so you cant gift subs? I had no idea
[5:25:15] <Ravioli_Ronin> @vantesla feels bad NotLikeThis
[5:25:16] <%DianaTheAscian> LUL
[5:25:30] <%heartlesshealer> oh noooooo
[5:25:42] <$QueequegTheater> It needed to go out to way more streamers than it did
[5:26:03] <$QueequegTheater> Like, every XIV streamer over 100 average viewers should've qualified
[5:26:04] <%heartlesshealer> marketing and public relations fucked up
