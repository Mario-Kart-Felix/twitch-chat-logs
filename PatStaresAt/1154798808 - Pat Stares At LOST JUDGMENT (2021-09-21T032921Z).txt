[0:14:08] <Tracazoid> Yeah, I'm watching this here instead of playing it since the insane agency decided I can't have Judgement on the PC
[0:14:09] <%DoubleRrico> man imagine not owning your own face
[0:14:11] <%JonathLP> @PatStaresAt He gets in an accident and has to have his face reconstructed
[0:14:12] <@Ranryu692> hopefully they do a new one with a new actor who isn't too expensive to do the karaoke segments
[0:14:12] <zzNamttamzz> he had to get face surgery at the end
[0:14:13] <%baka_sugoi> Past Judgment
[0:14:15] <%logoth_> He got face off'd
[0:14:17] <+Havictos> Because of stupid talent agency bullshit that says they OWN HIS FUCKING FACE
[0:14:19] <+FadingEmber> Skill Up hated the fact that you can throw kids out of windows in this video game
[0:14:21] <%Mr_Pylon> Smudgement and slightly different actor
[0:14:23] <themightyseptopus> Dark Judgment
[0:14:23] <%SveriSageAdvice> well now that's all i want lmao
[0:14:24] <Blank9> just have the nerd lawyer from judgement be playable
[0:14:24] <%DianaTheAscian> NO MORE ACTORS
[0:14:25] <%JoshManVGH> Over under on plastic surgery required by end of game?
[0:14:25] <Turf_Wind_and_Fire> I didn‚Äôt even realize this came out yet! I thought it wasn‚Äôt coming out until like next year.
[0:14:25] <%fat_burtreynolds> Terminator Judge****
[0:14:26] <%spitelite> forgotten judgement staring tanimura
[0:14:26] <+JustToWatch> he should be light on fire by the bad guy and he has to get facial reconstruction surgery
[0:14:27] <jorniev> @PatStaresAt can they stop people from making art of his face?
[0:14:28] <@ssjklyco> Just another Yakuza Prequel with Kiryu in the early 90s
[0:14:29] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Have it be Akiyama.
[0:14:29] <%notsoy> like 4R tanimura lol
[0:14:31] <%justcallmebobplease> And look at the camera Ichiban in the English scene!
[0:14:33] <%Garthunox> Akiyama could easily replace Yagami
[0:14:33] <%Agami23> dont use actors, just make characters like kiryu and ichiban
[0:14:34] <%Dakuu75> You have some funny ideas Pat, You're silly~
[0:14:36] <echobee_tv> Like Mark Hamill in New Hope vs Empire
[0:14:36] <+cascadepersona> It's gonna be his brother Iori Yagami
[0:14:37] <%justcallmebobplease> Gotta have a camera spike
[0:14:38] <%XzileGaming> hey, you look different. yeah, i got a blackface
[0:14:42] <Who_lio42> the new detective, Yamiga
[0:14:44] <OneThousandTomatoes> fuck em
[0:14:45] <%JonathLP> The name of the sequel: Blind Judgement
[0:14:45] <+ScrapKingKeita> Skill Up is COWARDLY
[0:14:45] <%Dakuu75> 10/10
[0:14:45] <Mrrccava> Skill up is wrong.
[0:14:46] <@Spydurman> they're crazy
[0:14:46] <RushUnplugged> yeah but skillup is 90% wrong
[0:14:47] <ThatGuyThere03> THAT'S THE BEST PART THOUGH
[0:14:48] <Mrrccava> as usual
[0:14:50] <%Bt_Robot> They could always mess up his face real bad for the sequel.
[0:14:51] <Valentinius_Anodyne> cowards
[0:14:52] <AdmiralHats> The protagonist has to go deep undercover and. change their entire appearance
[0:14:53] <RushUnplugged> he is made of wrong
[0:14:54] <earthboy2k> how could you hate that
[0:14:55] <%fat_burtreynolds> Rub in the Ashes
[0:14:56] <%DianaTheAscian> Skillup says a lot of things
[0:14:58] <%JoshManVGH> SkillUp needs to beat up more digital children!
[0:14:58] <+Havictos> @FadingEmber SkillUp has some takes I vehemently disagree with.
[0:14:58] <Tracazoid> Throw two kids through a window just for them Pat
[0:15:03] <%Bt_Robot> Like go full Skeletor
[0:15:08] <Run44forrest> You can what
[0:15:10] <GeltonZ> Children DESERVE to be thrown out windows! LETS GO!
[0:15:12] <%DoubleRrico> so many unthrown kids in skyrim
[0:15:13] <+cascadepersona> The Bully series exists for a reason
[0:15:13] <%BuckChuckman> Who doesn't like beating up kids?
[0:15:19] <%fatalDestiny> Defenestration of children is like my number one requested feature in any video game.
[0:15:22] <WebmanJax> Every teacher gets one!
[0:15:22] <%ShogunNoonto> fuck them kids
[0:15:25] <+trackles_64> pats age?
[0:15:25] <OneThousandTomatoes> or being the high school kids that get the shit kicked put of them
[0:15:27] <@Jekado> Basically that one scene from its always sunny
[0:15:30] <butthurtdave> Shit I'm 30 and a high school kid could probably beat my ass
[0:15:31] <ThatGuyThere03> Pat, I believe you could beat up a singular highschooler
[0:15:34] <Mrrccava> Skill up has such bad fucking takes I had to stop watching his content because it was actually insane screaming into the void.
[0:15:35] <owazowski> FUCK them kids
[0:15:36] <AdeptusExterminatus> Holy crap, just in time!
[0:15:38] <+pupil31> Pog
[0:15:38] <%JoshManVGH> With intense martial arts prowess!
[0:15:38] <colzack_> Skill up also just didn't like the first Judgment so it's not a surprise that he disliked this one too
[0:15:40] <+ScrapKingKeita> Yakuza 7, Persimmon Substory
[0:15:40] <iosephe> That's what FPSes are for
[0:15:45] <%Mr_Pylon> Tak goes to the P5 school
[0:15:45] <CatRidder> like a dragon?
[0:15:46] <%notsoy> not even GTA let you do that lmfao
[0:15:50] <%JoshManVGH> And like improvised weaponry and shit!
[0:15:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> I cant either
[0:15:55] <PleasedWorld> a 40 year old man with a tiger drop, no less
[0:15:57] <$boggze> lmao
[0:15:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If you can't kick kids out a window then your video game is lame, sorry but that's the rule
[0:15:59] <%fat_burtreynolds> Skyrim with mods
[0:15:59] <%Garthunox> You will
[0:16:00] <@Ranryu692> why
[0:16:00] <%DianaTheAscian> Pat is super hyped to beat the kids
[0:16:03] <butthurtdave> It's just one long day
[0:16:03] <AdeptusExterminatus> KomodoHype
[0:16:06] <Run44forrest> Pat how many highschoolers could you take down
[0:16:07] <%RigmaroleHM> But that takes multiple clicks to find
[0:16:07] <Blank9> just a quick look
[0:16:09] <xbb1024> it's a one off for 35 hours
[0:16:09] <Tracazoid> Could be a 35 hour 1-off
[0:16:10] <+trackles_64> soa  one off
[0:16:11] <%BlondieFDM> Pat, is this a 35 hour one off?
[0:16:12] <alexandrecau> pat your schedule means nothing
[0:16:12] <%notsoy> @Mr_Pylon I need yagami to throw kamoshida out of a window
[0:16:14] <%logoth_> Rapid one offs
[0:16:14] <%Taisuru> So you're saying there's a chance
[0:16:15] <%afronooch> 35 hours stream babay
[0:16:15] <$thesickestzak> So it‚Äôs a one off then?
[0:16:15] <amonimis> LUL
[0:16:16] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Big ONE OFF
[0:16:16] <%JonathLP> But if you stream all 35 hours in one sitting isn't it still a one off?
[0:16:18] <%RigmaroleHM> Daily one-off
[0:16:18] <%Agami23> a one week off
[0:16:19] <$thesickestzak> Kappa
[0:16:19] <%JoshManVGH> Daily one off

[0:16:27] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt you sure your not gonna burn out on it and drop it?
[0:16:27] <alexandrecau> There is no trust in your schedule it's broken
[0:16:27] <+trackles_64> FACTS
[0:16:27] <RushUnplugged> the stream just doesn't stop for the whole week so it's technically correct
[0:16:32] <scrumbotime> Just a very short quick look until its done for an undefined massive amount of time
[0:16:32] <$thesickestzak> Part 1/1 forever
[0:16:33] <@Ranryu692> remember Roguelike month?
[0:16:41] <Mrrccava> oh god no more heroes...

[0:16:55] <scrumbotime> Fair.

[0:20:25] <%megadblitz> woolie's missed a lot
[0:20:28] <scrumbotime> I know "blizzard makes a character gay to avoid bad press" is a dead horse by now but I think it'd be really funny if they had Winston just become Incredibly Gay.

[0:30:05] <%cade_calrayn> That's.... not what a twink is though
[0:30:07] <MoonKing> THAT MEANS BARAS ARE A-OKAY

[0:30:21] <GeltonZ> @artoflec It's...a long story. I just hate it for removing multiplayer and linear movement/directional inputs. I'm sure it's a fine game on its own, just not Tales for me.
[0:30:22] <@ssjklyco> That toilet thing was plague
[0:30:23] <DSD24> @ScrapKingKeita Aww yeah I love Assassin 229 and Ruler 431

[0:33:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I actually laughed when I found out that Sonic the Fighters was ported into this, incredible pull
[0:33:06] <%JoshManVGH> SPITE
[0:33:06] <CrowbarFacelift> I saw some stuff in the trailer that I liked, combat-wise

[0:33:09] <%whyskeywolfe> whyskeywolfe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 29 month streak! Shit yeah. more late-night streams. My sleep-cycle hasn't existed for months anyway.

[0:33:20] <%cobalt_phoenix_> thanks pat for spoiler free version
[0:33:23] <artoflec> oh wow it has easy automatic, is that the first time its had that?
[0:33:24] <%Axellogic> I literally cannot play Judgement 1
[0:33:26] <%Agami23> i wish i cared about judgement
[0:33:29] <Blank9> and they met zero people from the yakzua series while doing this, except for a nameless gimp
[0:33:29] <+beavnation> has this man lost his judgment?
[0:33:30] <GeltonZ> @Valentinius_Anodyne AND it's the 360/PS3 version so it has Honey! Press Start on Amy!
[0:33:34] <%greasypete00> that he got off Kappa
[0:33:36] <CatRidder> but wat happen with the vacant lote
[0:33:37] <+kewlmyc> SUPPOSEDLY
[0:33:41] <tanarath> Wait, Lost Judgement is Judgement 2?
[0:33:41] <$Falilth> cause the conviction rate is 99% that is a big deal
[0:33:42] <JetpackMcQuack> cop plots
[0:33:45] <+trackles_64> i waslooking forward to this on PC
[0:33:46] <+supersonic21> this game has a banger intro like 1 did
[0:33:53] <%baka_sugoi> no auto save
[0:33:56] <+handsomerakshas> Thx Pat for no spoilers im ch12 of judgement
[0:33:57] <+trackles_64> looks real
[0:33:59] <%MusouMiko> idk this game seems p real

[0:34:01] <Run44forrest> He should‚Äôve gotten them off better then
[0:34:01] <soakedhipster> imagine never turning on autosave
[0:34:05] <%isa_sensei96> vacant lot doesn't matter here.
[0:34:05] <CrowbarFacelift> I honestly wasn't a huge fan of Judgement's combat. I didn't like how often Yagami recoiled off of enemies.
[0:34:10] <leinadtonu> Japan is not real
[0:34:11] <%JohnAtDawn> OH THANK GOD ENGLISH
[0:34:13] <%Monkeyweed21> WHERES KUME

[0:37:04] <+Talhee> So where would Ichiban and crew be during all of this?
[0:37:07] <+MrMcCrabby> They cant pull out the bread tech immediately
[0:37:10] <%unhuggable1> damn the intro lipsync was so good
[0:37:11] <$SGrim> @RogueCrocodile There's a lot of cases that Japan never puts in a courtroom to keep the stat up.
[0:37:12] <willyfreshness> December 2021 HOLY SHIT ITS THE FUTURE
[0:37:13] <$boggze> bread!?
[0:37:14] <+trackles_64> its a bun

[0:37:22] <CrowbarFacelift> Greg Chun*
[0:37:22] <@ssjklyco> No bread tech
[0:37:26] <%Theycallmenerf> Is this game a more serious Yakuzies
[0:37:26] <DSD24> Crispin was the best Siegfried in SC3
[0:37:28] <glunchboy> that gene park thread on twitter was great, i dont know why people are so fkn biased against japanese stories and/or having fun
[0:37:32] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Hiding names
[0:37:32] <%JoshManVGH> Oh they are expressly dancing around the bread tech
[0:37:33] <Jokobeast> Ahh, I guess they didn't spend money on bread tech this time.
[0:37:36] <+ScrapKingKeita> Oh wait, they aren't using the lip sync tech they used for Yakuza LAD
[0:37:37] <%Axellogic> Good ol crispin
[0:37:37] <OneThousandTomatoes> eat the bread
[0:37:37] <+KaguraRaion> Pat you're covering names
[0:37:38] <+trackles_64> shes cute
[0:37:43] <$SGrim> What an optimistic game, thinking we'll make it as a species until December.
[0:37:46] <%unhuggable1> eboys
[0:37:46] <Saltmeisterr> greg chun also voices nanba in LaD
[0:37:51] <+Havictos> @justcallmebobplease They spent the bread tech budget on Ichiban
[0:37:51] <+handsomerakshas> Who asked u b
[0:37:51] <tanarath> Pat, your window is right over their names, can you move it for cutscenes?
[0:37:53] <%JoshManVGH> Internet is spicey
[0:37:57] <IntrepidEye> Hey Crispin Freeman. Haven't heard you around in a while
[0:37:59] <%Ne1son> no cool lip flap syncing? @patstaresat
[0:38:00] <+RAWPowerStudios> Oooof the english is really jarring.
[0:38:01] <soakedhipster> i see we're going with the no-rona AU
[0:38:01] <+trackles_64> hes the good guy
[0:38:06] <Brunty023> @ScrapKingKeita According to the team, they didn't have time to be able to do the lip syncing for the dub
[0:38:07] <+RogueCrocodile> @sgrim that feels worse, it sounds like some dystopian shit.
[0:38:07] <+KaguraRaion> :T
[0:38:15] <+trackles_64> Not a cop
[0:38:17] <%unhuggable1> :)

[0:38:39] <%justcallmebobplease> I unironically want center-Pat.  I like his placement being maximally intrusive.
[0:38:40] <%Mr_Pylon> keeps things fresh
[0:38:40] <CrowbarFacelift> They're doing the Yakuza LaD thing
[0:38:42] <+trackles_64> at least their lips move

[0:38:52] <+VeINoIVI> swinging between the knees
[0:38:53] <$SGrim> @RogueCrocodile it kind of is dystopian. Only cases that have near open-and-shut verdicts aren't just settled out of court.
[0:38:53] <Who_lio42> Tak please BLINK

[0:41:23] <+handsomerakshas> I always think of him as
[0:41:27] <DSD24> Already got tailing missions ResidentSleeper
[0:41:28] <@ssjklyco> Wait, is it just me, or is the LIP tech in those cutscenes with the static images?
[0:41:28] <%megadblitz> @zanz_san if its not that can only mean its on a mission
[0:41:32] <%Deekman> Skill Up is a moron this game rules

[0:44:38] <+xerotwo> PogChamp
[0:44:40] <%cvp5127> fucking shu
[0:44:41] <@Ranryu692> yes
[0:44:41] <%SveriSageAdvice> wow it is
[0:44:42] <%isa_sensei96> is that Bryce Papenbrooke!?
[0:44:42] <Madinki> It looks like
[0:44:42] <%takotoots> looks like it
[0:44:43] <DSD24> That sounds like Tiz from Bravely Default
[0:44:43] <%notsoy> the localization team said no, iirc
[0:44:43] <%DianaTheAscian> yeah
[0:44:44] <alexandrecau> Either secret korean or scammers
[0:44:44] <+kewlmyc> It's Papenbrook.
[0:44:44] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> maybe
[0:44:44] <%greasypete00> maybe
[0:44:46] <%Dakuu75> Looks like yes
[0:44:46] <%zanz_san> it's word fit
[0:44:47] <RushUnplugged> iirc they said they didn't do it for this for time reasons
[0:44:48] <ElSuperNova> Dub magic bby
[0:44:50] <+RogueCrocodile> Kirito!
[0:44:51] <+izanagi22> I don't think so, but it's close
[0:44:52] <%NitronStreams> I think the only ingame scene yluse automatic lipflaps
[0:44:52] <lKaleidoscopel> looks like it
[0:44:54] <+NeonLight> Bryce, why are you always here?!
[0:44:55] <+Damer92> did they update the engine from Judgment?
[0:44:55] <%Garthunox> @televisedrevolting No its Lawtalesofarise
[0:44:57] <Who_lio42> yes. it was like that in judgment
[0:44:58] <+Havictos> Oh host club?
[0:45:03] <%Undenizen> the american accents with japanese words is so weird.
[0:45:03] <%Ne1son> weird because the first cuts energy wasn't
[0:45:04] <%greasypete00> some it looks like yes and others its a very big no
[0:45:05] <+gamehog19> Yeah only I game not movie cutscenes
[0:45:06] <Brunty023> Not entirely. The team said they didn't have enough time to do it for the dub
[0:45:06] <RushUnplugged> probably just matching flaps from the actors
[0:45:08] <%megadblitz> oh no they fightin
[0:45:10] <%isa_sensei96> Damn, Cat Noir gets around!
[0:45:12] <+kewlmyc> He's just doing his Law/Kirito voice
[0:45:13] <@Spydurman> WE'LL KILL YOU
[0:45:18] <agadejobi> I don't know, maybe it's just me, but they should probably work out words like "senpai" if they're gonna dub it
[0:45:23] <RushUnplugged> dude VAs are gooood at it
[0:45:25] <+OmegaFatalis> I'll never get used to english dubs using honorifics. I just sounds  so unnatural
[0:45:25] <%notsoy> i think it's major cutscenes that arne't
[0:45:27] <%Qsmash_> procedural lip sync maybe?
[0:45:36] <+NeonLight> Square did it in VII, wouldnt be surprised
[0:45:36] <+Havictos> Like Trafalgar Law?
[0:45:39] <agadejobi> I mean, I'm not offended by it, but why not?
[0:45:47] <%GarbageNirvana> I imagine they probably ran the voice lines through something yeah
[0:45:51] <+izanagi22> Oh I like Tailing having a style like Crane/Tiger in the top left
[0:45:51] <alexandrecau> kamuloop
[0:45:51] <Profmcstevie> Major cutscene naroSalute
[0:45:52] <colzack_> It's not as synced as LaD because of the simultaneous release but it's done to a degree
[0:45:52] <%takotoots> what the dog doin?
[0:45:52] <iosephe> OH SHIT
[0:45:53] <%megadblitz> he wants that dog
[0:45:56] <%notsoy> in-engine things, you could almost certainly do it procedurally, but big cutscenes probably not
[0:45:56] <marvel877> Some of it looks synced and some of it looks off. Like, every other thing so far.
[0:45:58] <Madinki> @PatStaresAt Apparently they couldn't do lip sync for real cut scenes due to time constraints.
[0:45:58] <%Undenizen> quick! kill it!
[0:46:00] <+gamehog19> WAIT
[0:46:01] <%bustawof> YO

[0:48:08] <%AncelDeLambert> Is that guy over there drinking COFFEE??!? GET HIM!"
[0:48:09] <%Undenizen> i like how the goons in this game always wear suits and floral shirts
[0:48:11] <xbb1024> this is warm up for the high school bashing
[0:48:13] <+kewlmyc> Tiger > Crane
[0:48:20] <Brunty023> Crane theme is called Blue Stompin
[0:48:20] <%NitronStreams> Time to breakdance on their faces
[0:48:21] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt I love this fantasy Japan where people will just attack you in the streets
[0:48:23] <artoflec> oh shit there's a PEFFECDT dodge now?
[0:48:24] <Saltmeisterr> catJAM
[0:48:26] <mr_saturday93> damn I missed the intro

[0:49:14] <owazowski> Too bad I can't beat up back pain
[0:49:18] <Saltmeisterr> the jams never stop groovin
[0:49:23] <radregice> they're kinda hitting their stride a little more with dragon engine combat
[0:49:23] <colzack_> The evade is new
[0:49:24] <CrowbarFacelift> I like how Crane incorporated multiple enemies into it's heat moves. It was pretty lacking overall though.
[0:49:24] <%jinking79> wonder how hard Jo gonna be in this game
[0:49:26] <%notsoy> i guess evades are way bigger in crane?
[0:49:27] <%KishinGrek> KishinGrek subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! been thinking about the Next Mainline Yakuza game, would you rather have Ichiban fight with the old team or have a brand new story relevant team to learn new skills with?
[0:49:27] <nipplestheenchilada96> honestly love the sound of the clothes rustling
[0:49:33] <%AncelDeLambert> look at this tae kwon do
[0:49:35] <+gamehog19> Yeah I think each fighting style has different animations
[0:49:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Nice
[0:49:49] <%AncelDeLambert> oof, that was a wrist breaker
[0:49:53] <radregice> love the dodge LUl

[0:49:59] <%KishinGrek> nailed it
[0:50:01] <soakedhipster> man i can't wait to get my hands on this, i loved the fighting
[0:50:03] <$Falilth> so didn't they say there's gonna be more rpg games in the future was that after this one was in dev?
[0:50:04] <@Ranryu692> Yagami still looks like he's wearing jeggings
[0:50:06] <%DoubleRrico> perfectly incognito
[0:50:10] <Saltmeisterr> OMG

[0:50:22] <DSD24> The tightest tight pants
[0:50:23] <%KishinGrek> I wonder if Drunk fist is still OP in this game
[0:50:24] <Saltmeisterr> I RECOGNIZE THAT GUY
[0:50:27] <%AncelDeLambert> shame taekwon do is one of those "useless in real life" styles
[0:50:33] <%alternative_flu> dude I was JUST thinking that

[0:50:49] <Dova573> Hes no Ichiban
[0:50:51] <@Jekado> maybe the ad company that owns the actor took his ass out?
[0:50:52] <CrowbarFacelift> that boy ain't right
[0:50:54] <%bustawof> some men arent meant to bake cake
[0:50:54] <%KishinGrek> bwaaah

[0:50:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Don't mind me :)
[0:50:59] <Profmcstevie> Ass is smooth so he can parry with it
[0:51:02] <+bluefootedpigs> They airbrush models in a mag, but no when 3d modeling for games?
[0:51:04] <%Undenizen> japanese men aren't allowed to have asses. wouldn't want to be GAY in a yakuzi game!
[0:51:05] <%alternative_flu> I can't get over how flat it is
[0:51:05] <missingangle> Kiryu and Ichi had all that ass, guess they wanted to change things up
[0:51:06] <+RogueCrocodile> Mr Popo?
[0:51:13] <soakedhipster> deflated his cake to own sega and kimutaku
[0:51:19] <$lotharrio> So is this just more Yakuza, then?
[0:51:36] <GeltonZ> @Jekado Maybe a different company owns his ass. It's a legal dispute...WHY DOES THAT SOUND PLAUSIBLE TO ME!
[0:51:38] <@Jekado> i barely remember them until i marathon'd all the games
[0:51:39] <%notsoy> nakamichi is the one with cafe alps and the arcade

[1:28:41] <Jokobeast> IT'S A RUSE
[1:28:42] <%KineticZen> Not foreshadowed at all
[1:28:44] <+SenorCounter> Would love for this case to be a fake out.
[1:28:44] <Brandon__Brando> omg is this a yakuza procedural cop game!?
[1:28:45] <+CherteuseKapibara> amogus?
[1:28:45] <ElJeffroPR> Dun dun dun

[1:29:13] <Madinki> He was really grouping the EMPTY LOT
[1:29:18] <agadejobi> @CopperTucker It's about the EMPTIER LOT
[1:29:21] <+spartanluchador534> isnt hoshino the old yakuza boss in Y7?
[1:29:29] <boardscanada> I think it'd be cool to have a Persona 6 that looks a bit more like this, less anime, half-realistic and half cartoonish
[1:29:31] <%chiazam> Hoshino she‚Äôs out of your league man
[1:29:32] <Brandon__Brando> @OneThousandTomatoes EVEN BETTER!!!
[1:29:46] <alexandrecau> Conviction rate different
[1:29:56] <alexandrecau> when they are cops
[1:29:58] <JetpackMcQuack> BibleThump
[1:30:04] <%DianaTheAscian> That happens often
[1:30:05] <Blank9> he'd do great on the US police force
[1:30:06] <Run44forrest> Cops get a free grope?
[1:30:09] <agadejobi> The problem with using actors in these games is that it makes porting these games in the future very difficult
[1:30:10] <@Jekado> is this gonna be Cops are bad again...
[1:30:16] <@Jekado> like in yakuza.... all of them...
[1:30:16] <+ClungleBungle> How lost has this judgment been?
[1:30:17] <%notsoy> totally not a murder, yagami never killed a man
[1:30:23] <%chiazam> Oh he‚Äôs probably innocent if the plot is set up like this
[1:30:25] <agadejobi> Japanese Business Politics is a beast you don't want your franchise near
[1:30:25] <AdmiralHats> Man, feels like real life

[1:31:17] <+izanagi22> That's early for a warning like that

[1:39:52] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[1:39:55] <soakedhipster> they said in the judgment day stream that ichi's games are supposed to stay rpg iirc, judgment was supposed to be taking on the action bit

[1:44:39] <pi_in_the_sci> Then they give sentence, then the rational for that
[1:44:43] <h0wiewong> Just gonna confess to a murder
[1:44:43] <sponsoredviewer910> the rationale is to justify the judgment
[1:44:50] <Crippl3> that's gross!

[1:52:04] <%cooldude69xx> @Dakuu75 Everything about FF 15 slowly got better since release. Its a shame it didnt come out in the state its in now.
[1:53:12] <%MusouMiko> also wait who gifted me a sub
[1:53:20] <%MusouMiko> well, thanks mysterious sub gifter ‚ù§Ô∏è
[1:53:22] <+Havictos> @cooldude69xx To me their mistake was trying to make it some big multimedia experience instead of just having everything in game. I still like it though.
[1:53:33] <CrowbarFacelift> big doomps happening

[1:55:34] <%cooldude69xx> @Felhad I know. The event being good reminded me that FF 15 probably doesnt suck as much anymore either
[1:55:38] <%kingmemelord97> i shall clam this twich channel in the name of uncle sam
[1:55:53] <%Felhad> it doesnt! replayed it recently
[1:56:08] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I‚Äôm never gonna get enough MGP for the car tho üò≠
[1:56:10] <%Felhad> the last chapter is infinitely better than at release
[1:56:16] <artoflec> @cooldude69xx my feelings of FFXV are 90% of the reason i love it are things that didn't even exist when the game launched. Royal Edition is a pretty significant overhaul.
[1:56:29] <%Taisuru> @Felhad I liked 15 at the time but wanted to wait for all the DLC to come out, then it didn't. I heard recently there's a novel covering the stuff they cancelled though so maybe I'll be revisiting it?
[1:56:35] <%Felhad> you have 5 weeks left Syd, you can get 60k a week from Fashion Report alone
[1:57:16] <artoflec> @Taisuru the DLC did come out, the rest were an alternate timeline/ending path that they were going to do.

[3:05:13] <%snugglepuggs> !uptime
[3:05:14] <@Moobot> @snugglepuggs I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 5m.
[3:05:16] <moonwraithdruckmann> is this game as bad as people are saying?
[3:05:22] <%KishinGrek> did they bring back the LVL up drinks?
[3:05:25] <%TheMoenia> they deserve to be on pc too
[3:05:36] <+izanagi22> LAD got 2nd place from Giant Bomb last year
[3:05:39] <agadejobi> It's bad if you don't like beating up children
[3:05:40] <churropoppa> B R O T H E R
[3:05:43] <+supersonic21> the only people saying its bad is ign and they gave it to a person who doesnt play these games lmao
[3:05:46] <pi_in_the_sci> SkillUp doesn't like beating kids
[3:05:50] <gildor0> it has gotten some middling reviews for some reason
[3:05:53] <%Monkeyweed21> even 6?
[3:05:56] <pi_in_the_sci> That's his baggage
[3:05:59] <%Agami23> people who think this is bad are probably upset about beating up on children who are bullies
[3:06:00] <RushUnplugged> whoever says this is bad, is someone who's opinion you should quickly stop listening to
[3:06:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @supersonic21 that's par for the course then
[3:06:04] <colzack_> Was a shame LaD only got nominated for best rpg last year
[3:06:05] <+izanagi22> So is there a set rotation?
[3:06:07] <%TheMoenia> 6 was good
[3:06:08] <+JustToWatch> shame that Disco Elysium Final Cut also came out this year
[3:06:11] <hoopray> lol ign reviews
[3:06:15] <%cvp5127> coward
[3:06:16] <+favadem> the only thing this game is missing is a style meter
[3:06:20] <%notsoy> he's wrong, beating up children is VERY important
[3:06:24] <%DianaTheAscian> A lot
[3:06:25] <Zombrocom> A great deal
[3:06:25] <%KishinGrek> "journalists" are saying it's not serious enough and it's boring
[3:06:27] <cervidaequus> Gun trick sword these losers
[3:06:28] <@Jekado> maybe people were thinking it was gonna be another turn based Yakuza?
[3:06:28] <pi_in_the_sci> He didn't like beating kids poetically and hilariously
[3:06:29] <Ardailec> He was pretty adamant that the beating of children was wrong.
[3:06:29] <+favadem> exclusive for the kids
[3:06:30] <%hat_under_bread> Fuck em. More games need to let/encourage you to beat up kids.
[3:06:32] <Goldenwolf98> 6 was fine 3 deserves zero love LUL
[3:06:34] <%RealThiele> story critical child beatings
[3:06:35] <Blank9> everybody gets one (entire game's worth)
[3:06:36] <+Havictos> Skillup is hack
[3:06:36] <Dr_Mooose> they gotta learn
[3:06:37] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Did you see lowtiergod was arrested?
[3:06:37] <Zombrocom> It was about 60% of the review
[3:06:39] <Alabyctor> ign or gamespot said the game was bad
[3:06:41] <+Majkir> The 2 biggest negatives were redundant dialogue and being a 40 YO beating kids.
[3:06:42] <%cvp5127> booooo
[3:06:43] <+JustToWatch> you have to beat up the children, for the children
[3:06:45] <@Jekado> sounds like it
[3:06:46] <Monkeyking966> also he didnt like dmc or bayo
[3:06:50] <Goldenwolf98> THAT SOUNDS LIKE A COWARD
[3:06:54] <xbb1024> He said there was a narrative dissonance because you wouldn't actually beat up kids IRL
[3:06:54] <maskeddudej> don't you befriend some kids later?
[3:06:54] <%Niney_Who> Sounds like someone who doesn't know to exploit enemy's weaknesses
[3:06:55] <%KishinGrek> @futurecity10 for what?
[3:07:02] <@ssjklyco> If they didn't want to be beat up, they should not live in a Yakuza world
[3:07:02] <+CaptainJax> punching children is morally correct
[3:07:03] <%megadblitz> take that johnny from 10th grade fuck you
[3:07:04] <RushUnplugged> there's 2 kinds of people, people who are fine with some bully punching, and bullies
[3:07:04] <%Dementedpenguin> @Monkeyking966 oof

[3:07:11] <$Futurecity10> @KishinGrek Revenge porn
[3:07:13] <%snugglepuggs> He has to learn to beat children
[3:07:14] <%TheMoenia> you are not beating up kids tho, you are beating up bullys

[3:07:20] <%CodyStruggles> He sounds like a bitch
[3:07:29] <%KishinGrek> that sounds like a pedo's excuse for not beating up kids

[3:13:20] <+MrMcCrabby> No it has to be hidden spy cams that NO ONE knows about
[3:13:22] <OneThousandTomatoes> which I guess is why all the kids in my high school vaped in the bathrooms
[3:13:30] <%RealThiele> counsel these guns
[3:13:37] <+izanagi22> That would imply that Admins give a shit about teachers

[3:15:17] <%snugglepuggs> Imagine how funny it would be if there were a couple bullies in the chat rn LUL
[3:15:18] <%DianaTheAscian> Yes I knew some
[3:15:19] <CatRidder> teachers are just big kids
[3:15:20] <%notsoy> so that way nobody knows if they're ever safe
[3:15:20] <+terry_quest> remove their hands
[3:15:22] <pi_in_the_sci> Obviously, the most horrific bullies are teachers
[3:15:29] <+twohitgood> it was always the fucking meathead.
[3:15:29] <%Agami23> i want to fucking throw some teachers i hate out a window.
[3:15:31] <%beepbeepbopbop> elbow drop those teachers
[3:15:32] <%RealThiele> sus

[3:15:39] <%insomniac_doze_> had a teacher that straight up said in class that bullying is good and necessary
[3:15:42] <TimetodiveLTX> should kill me

[3:16:00] <+Your_Lord_and_Senpai> this dub is pretty good
[3:16:02] <%Bt_Robot> Because school can be run like a prison, and some teachers love to watch the students fight
[3:16:03] <the1wholoves> I had a teacher who wanted to be the "cool" teacher by making fun of the student with no friends
[3:16:03] <pi_in_the_sci> A teacher that wants 30 pounds of books to attend their class is a bad person
[3:16:04] <%Niney_Who> Wow a school cares about a student's suicide? Shocking
[3:16:05] <%RealThiele> hanged

[3:29:31] <+izanagi22> ") is used in formal writing, and sometimes in very formal speech, for referring to a person who is unfamiliar to the speaker, typically a person known through publications whom the speaker has never actually met."
[3:29:32] <soakedhipster> it's what newscasters use for people they don't know, he's out of touch
[3:29:39] <+MrMcCrabby> Its otaku talk basically
