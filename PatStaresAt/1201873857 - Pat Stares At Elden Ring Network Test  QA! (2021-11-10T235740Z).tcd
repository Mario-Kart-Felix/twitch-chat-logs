[0:29:03] <teh_Question> the builds in the is game are gonna be fucking off the wall

[0:29:20] <+Gorgodrn> @izanagi22 you can switch them around. No limit
[0:29:20] <AngryPumpkin1995> MURDER THOSE SHINS! :P
[0:29:21] <%SpcOpsBear> You can freely swap out any weapon arts you can equip, and each weapon also has a built-in default weapon art
[0:29:22] <@PlagueOfGripes> beeg stomp
[0:29:23] <cheapdoc> Speeeen
[0:29:23] <Vallhaine> Torrent don't give no fucks
[0:29:23] <@PeachSaliva> I love the pony
[0:29:24] <Louie_Salmon> Oh wow you do massively more damage on horseback
[0:29:25] <%athuramn> this is so cool D;
[0:29:25] <teh_Question> i wonder if tail cutting is back
[0:29:27] <%king_wragles> So pre-order is open right?
[0:29:31] <dan_g_v> so we are going to get nsfw mods for this one, right? Like in SKyrim
[0:29:31] <ferretking131> oof

[0:29:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Welp lads.....the easiest GOTY choice ever?
[0:29:41] <%king_wragles> Huge dragon fight, Peach stuck on the pony...
[0:29:43] <%g0atmeal> we got moves from kalameet, midir, and king of storms that i've seen so far
[0:29:43] <thebestesttrashpanda> @QueequegTheater i  never used that one fuck me lmao
[0:29:44] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> The Goat/Pony is a wonderful addition
[0:29:45] <+izanagi22> @Gorgodrn That's a relief. Would've been major item hoarding otherwise
[0:29:48] <@QueequegTheater> @PlagueOfGripes Did you get into the network test? I would love to see your thoughts
[0:29:49] <kazadaz> Can you fucking IMAGINE Bloodborne made in this style?
[0:29:58] <danraven> can you mount mid-combat?
[0:29:58] <@QueequegTheater> @thebestesttrashpanda btfo lmao
[0:29:58] <@PlagueOfGripes> I haven't played this at all, no
[0:30:01] <Daniel_Is_I> That is Sinh's fire sweep
[0:30:04] <+twohitgood> that overhead fire is totally midir.
[0:30:05] <RubberFistFight> That fire attack is straight up lifted from Midir
[0:30:06] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> hell DS3 already felt like a greatest hits
[0:30:06] <%king_wragles> but ya, the pony is pretty cool
[0:30:07] <NewWillinium> We've gone from "This is the Dark Souls of blank" to "This is the Skyrim of blank".
[0:30:09] <SolumFuturae> Gumbo
[0:30:09] <%Valdorick> But what spell turns us into an Armored Core? Kappa
[0:30:10] <RubberFistFight> the diagonal sweep
[0:30:12] <Daxalog> So theres an armored core fight?
[0:30:12] <illtima> This flying move is just straight up Midir!
[0:30:15] <ferretking131> like souls, but bigger

[0:32:06] <AngryPumpkin1995> Sword and board makes a glorious return :P
[0:32:06] <+MelodyMedley> LUL
[0:32:10] <SaltyAzteca> Wait what??
[0:32:10] <ferretking131> oh wow
[0:32:10] <dan_g_v> jumpin, such bizarre experience
[0:32:10] <+twohitgood> shields and poise...we're DS1 boiz
[0:32:10] <MidnightPacif1c> fromsoft copied melty blood
[0:32:13] <+griffball13> BIG POISE
[0:32:17] <%Valdorick> So what's foward + Attack now?
[0:32:21] <+izanagi22> X is jump??

[0:32:27] <medoodoo> IS THIS CORPORATE PAT?
[0:32:27] <$ItsRatman> PLEASE  Fromsoft, let us Mikiri Counter in this game
[0:32:28] <%RealThiele> stabbed his dick
[0:32:29] <+Caidezes> RIP Jumps attacks. Killed by jump attacks.
[0:32:31] <Jrocy247> Sekiro jump attack
[0:32:36] <+krispen_wa> This is the Under Night In Birth of Skyrim
[0:32:36] <+twohitgood> @Reanimator83 yes
[0:32:38] <SolumFuturae> I like how it fades out parts close to the cam
[0:32:38] <+RhysClark97> i dont like sword and shikled gameplay but as long as theirs an optiont to not then im good
[0:32:38] <medoodoo> PAT SOUNDS SO CIVIL
[0:32:39] <ECRead> jump attacks are dead, long live jump attacks
[0:32:40] <nabs96> @plagueofgripes Yeah I hope that remains. Challenge is more fun when it comes from skill rather than us losing most of our health with one hit lol
[0:32:43] <NewWillinium> The idea of a Attack out of a succesful block is getting me so hype.
[0:32:43] <%SpcOpsBear> The Kick is gone on the default moveset. It's now even STRONGER when bare-handing though as a weapon art.
[0:32:43] <%barrakuta371> Jump attacks replaced by jump attacks
[0:32:44] <BlueSpartan119> @Valdorick nothing iirc
[0:32:46] <@PeachSaliva> Pat is in Business Pat Mode.

[0:33:08] <@Moobot> @Valdorick "If you *ever* have the opportunity to sell out you sell out as hard as you can it will be the best thing that ever happened to your fucking life! No one ever regretted selling out, except for 'artists' who care about their 'integrity' 'n shit." ~Pat 2016
[0:33:08] <LoneFonte> oooh

[0:33:25] <slix3431> Jump attack looks dumb
[0:33:25] <+mechslayer71> guys, I applied for a code but didn't get in. I'm in America, is it just first come first serve here or did it also work only off codes for the states?
[0:33:26] <%blastyoboots> that feels AMAZING
[0:33:29] <MelfinaStarwind> can anyone who has access to the test stream it?
[0:33:31] <+izanagi22> Takes up a LOT of Stamina though
[0:33:32] <%g0atmeal> sekiro did that too
[0:33:33] <%RayReborne> Literally Zelda jump attacks lol

[0:40:08] <TheButtravage> @Louie_Salmon It's looking like DS3 mechanically again.
[0:40:14] <%sporeian94> WHAT ABOUT THE LORE, WHAT IS THE ELDEN RING?

[0:41:11] <Archmortal> Spellcasting definitely is not a bust if the full charge doesn't go off in time
[0:41:12] <$CrownlessKitty> stamina management looks pretty forgiving in lieu of the more complex combat mechanics, i like it, i like it a lot
[0:41:13] <T_Sasquatch> I have the stream on audio only. Is it worth waiting to see for myself or should i just say fuck it

[0:46:23] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @PatStaresAt From a story perspective, is there an aspect of the world building or plot that makes it unique from Dark Souls, or is this really just Dark Souls 4?

[0:51:05] <Majin_Kuum> we need open world bloodborne after this
[0:51:09] <SuperJellyFrogEx> Is there still horrid action queueing like in DS3?
[0:51:11] <personalityoverload> Is there a good, mid, and fat jump based off weight like there is with rolls?
[0:51:15] <%Divryne> Divryne subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months! Yo is two handing a toggle or a button hold? Were there any super great swords in the network test that you found?
[0:51:15] <Rao2357> @SaphronBlackbourne Last Giant like boss; power stance back at the very least

[0:51:57] <%bread_assassin> @PatStaresAt What does Arcane do? Is it just a third casting stat? What separates it from INT and FTH?
[0:51:57] <GarbageNirvana> I really wish I enjoyed Souls-style games cause this sounds like stuff I'd be into
[0:51:58] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> @PatStaresAt So are there any towns or settlements like Firelink or the Chapel?
[0:51:59] <digaogrunge> use the whole animal
[0:51:59] <%valriot> How plausible do you it is to start new game, and b-line to a specific area for a specific spell/weapon/art? That was the best part of Dark Souls 1

[0:56:00] <@QueequegTheater> 0/10
[0:56:00] <willsin4fun> no kick?!
[0:56:00] <%TwistParabola> oof
[0:56:01] <%justcallmebobplease> How many [BIG MAGIC SWORD] spells and skills did you find - enough to make a playstyle?
[0:56:01] <DaKnightWarrior> NotLikeThis
[0:56:02] <scht3v3> 0/10 no horse petting
[0:56:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> POISE
[0:56:05] <%chiazam> Jumping attacks have replaced jumping attacks
[0:56:05] <+terry_quest> apparently your kick is not a thing you can do when using bare fists
[0:56:06] <ovan20> rooD no pets? 0/10
[0:56:06] <dan_g_v> do we get to kill Dannerys or Jon Snow?
[0:56:07] <+Arnoldoaad1> NO PET HORSE!!
[0:56:07] <%Aleate> No Pet PoroSad
[0:56:07] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype SICK

[0:56:11] <$thesickestzak> Get good if you want to do that
[0:56:11] <%Frost_Quill> 0/10 let me pet the horse.
[0:56:12] <OneThousandTomatoes> is kick on empty hand?
[0:56:13] <+DeadlyPeaks> Horse immortal, or horrible death screams?
[0:56:15] <+BignanasTheGawd> new defensive options?

[0:56:17] <susukouhai> 0/10‚Ä¶
[0:56:18] <+VincentBrouillons> like nioh ?
[0:56:18] <+tactician0> yeah its cool af
[0:56:19] <+purps26> wait does that mean there's no kicking opening shields?
[0:56:20] <%FemmeAndroid> Are there plunging attacks?
[0:56:23] <%Dingus_Tickler> Can‚Äôt pet the horse? THIS GAME SUCKS
[0:56:24] <thebestesttrashpanda> @bread_assassin its basically just the ds3 luck stat reskinned
[0:56:25] <%animaturgy> @willsin4fun Kick is the weapon art for being unarmed
[0:56:25] <EphideII> @willsin4fun The kick is in the unarmed moveset now
[0:56:29] <+polothegreatest> Does GRRM told you in detail how the food looked? doodOK
[0:56:29] <scht3v3> Counter? I hardly know her
[0:56:30] <%blastyoboots> according to IronPineapple's vid, Horse posture knockdowns knock you down for A LONG FUCKING TIME, and that's the balance for being able to use your horse in combat because there's that risk
[0:56:31] <+NiktenKing> attack jumping replaced jumping attacks
[0:56:33] <%SWFanatic> are the horses testicles fully rendered in 4K?
[0:56:46] <+tentavision> This is a place of pain, no love allowed
[0:56:47] <illtima> what stops you from spamming guard attack?
[0:56:57] <%g0atmeal> Does the game pause?
[0:56:59] <bone_reaper69> did you find any NPC's/quests?
[0:57:00] <skolacic> I assume blocking with a weapon still does chip damage?
[0:57:04] <T_Sasquatch> @patstaresat does the horse have realistic testicles that react to weather ?
[0:57:05] <heartlesshealer> fucking shut up this is the stream title
[0:57:06] <$thesickestzak> Large Marge
[0:57:08] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt do the horse balls dynamically respond to the weather and climate?
[0:57:11] <%valriot> Is there still an equip weight? I saw you could equip 3 weapons
[0:57:13] <%RayReborne> So invisible Posture Meter?????
[0:57:13] <%bread_assassin> @thebestesttrashpanda So Item Discovery and all that?
[0:57:14] <+terry_quest> i recommend watching iron pineapples video it has a lot of mechanical features
[0:57:16] <%notsoy> guard attack is NOT invincible so you can get hit out of it if you do it too early, right?
[0:57:17] <+griffball13> thats fine
[0:57:24] <drawerinkshow> Wish we could see it like Sekiro
[0:57:25] <kingjobber08> Item weight being tied to STR sounds damn good for all the fellow STR chads out there with how poise seems to work
[0:57:25] <dw420_dylan> What was the coolest looking armor set?
[0:57:25] <+ZodiacWars> are the weapon art items consumables? how do they work with respect to upgrading weapons? @PatStaresAt
[0:57:27] <%Valdorick> They will NEVER Gywn us again.
[0:57:29] <RubberFistFight> @T_Sasquatch bahahah we both asked the exact same thing
[0:57:30] <moonbearbacon> can you change the horse's appearance?
[0:57:30] <%0dokuro> Also like Sekiro to an extent
[0:57:30] <Fro5tburn> interesting
[0:57:35] <Visorak6> Does parry still protect you completely?
[0:57:42] <Drusain> Did dungeon exploration remind you or chalice dungeons?
[0:57:46] <+Ataerus> Did i miss the vid?
[0:57:46] <$CrownlessKitty> @kingjobber08 big poise 4 big boyz
[0:57:47] <bone_reaper69> NPCs?
[0:57:48] <%Dingus_Tickler> @patstaresat Does your horse poop in real time? Like Metal Gear Solid V
[0:57:52] <heartlesshealer> Is parry still friend?
[0:57:53] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:57:54] <irontatsumi> Any roll alternatives?
[0:57:55] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> From a story perspective, is there an aspect of the world building or plot that makes it unique from Dark Souls, or is this really just Dark Souls 4?

[1:03:08] <RubberFistFight> @FanServ There's already articles written about how empty the world feels and how it's disappointing and you probably shouldn't buy it, as if the network test is the final state of the game. People are unrelentingly fucking stupid./

[1:05:44] <%AgniBrandt> I've always had issues in DS3 where (prior to cinders) I couldn't bring myself to use weapon arts because FP felt finite. Would you say it feels more plentiful now, with the flask restores from group fights?
[1:05:44] <%hax_metatron> Deltarunes

[1:06:02] <peyodogo> are there spiders?
[1:06:04] <mexsystem> Are there transforming weapons similar to Bloodborne?
[1:06:04] <+Tsumikiro> does the stellar level design from older DS games suffer from the game being open world?
[1:06:05] <%StebTheVee> No fire?
[1:06:08] <%JamesCorck> Is it all a single sandbox or are there areas like in Monster Hunter?

[1:09:10] <kazadaz> Does armour appear to matter much?
[1:09:11] <RubberFistFight> @bearman414 it's a network test, GRRM helped with the lore worldbuilding. There's not enough of the game in this to "feel his influence".
[1:09:12] <LorcaNomad> that's so cool
[1:09:16] <+bearman414> @QueequegTheater makes sense i still wasnt sure of his involvement, like if he helped design enemoes
[1:09:16] <@ssjklyco> So pick your scaling lie?
[1:09:17] <Dova573> Get that Uchi and summon swords
[1:09:18] <+BignanasTheGawd> so spell sword builds are finally here
[1:09:18] <+MihriChan> THATS SO GOOD
[1:09:19] <Bearheart223> Can you have a lightning weapon art with the weapon itself not having faith scaling?

[1:09:23] <%JoshManVGH> Oh... oh that's good if it's not a lie!
[1:09:23] <%skizzuto> Does that change the scaling on the whole weapon or just the weapon art?
[1:09:23] <%SWFanatic> Are there Skeletons for Paige to date?
[1:09:26] <+SnorlaxBud> YOOOO
[1:09:27] <+Majkir> Nice, good bye to infusions.

[1:09:31] <Treasure_Vault> Can you swap midfight?
[1:09:31] <notabrobro> sounds very anti-goblin
[1:09:32] <%RayReborne> and you can un equip it and equip it to something else as many times as you want?
[1:09:36] <JonnyJug> Can you have ashes on multiple weapons at the same time?
[1:09:38] <jorniev> DO THE NUMBERS LIE IN THIS ONE?
[1:09:39] <+midnightmeatman> AWESOME I was wondering if ash of war was reusable

[1:09:46] <Vivirmos> Am I going to get as addicted to this as I did to Dragon's Dogma?
[1:09:47] <bone_reaper69> See any NPC's/quests?
[1:09:49] <+Xanadir> Any easier to respec in Elden Ring vs older souls games?
[1:09:50] <stranger59> SUCC
[1:09:51] <kazadaz> Do clothing stats matter, or are we Fashion Ring?
[1:09:51] <slippery_arms> how were invasions handled? does it tell you when you get invaded?

[1:10:35] <+polothegreatest> 16 times the detail KomodoHype
[1:10:38] <+Aikao> Can you swap these on the fly?
[1:10:40] <@QueequegTheater> Don't worry, they'll be nerfing lightning before launch Kappa
[1:10:48] <+mecha_11> So you still have to work if you want a specific build.
[1:10:51] <%0dokuro> interesting
[1:10:51] <AllenDeadman> huh
[1:10:51] <%WhereIsWill> thats SICK
[1:10:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> HOLY SHIT

[1:10:56] <zerointelligence000> that's rad
[1:10:57] <%Vextalyst> does Elden ring let you rebind controller like DS3?
[1:10:57] <dan_g_v> options!
[1:10:57] <+Fefe41> How was the level design and enemy placements in the overworld? Souls-esque or like MGS5
[1:10:58] <grumblybunnys> did you find any shortcuts?
[1:11:02] <+tactician0> makes sence
[1:11:04] <%barrakuta371> Please no nerf lightning please FromSoft
[1:11:06] <%hax_metatron> @patstaresat How much are you salivating at the prospect of a Cinders-style mod for Elden Ring?
[1:11:09] <Treasure_Vault> So, attuning spells
[1:11:10] <+midnightmeatman> imagine ash of war quick swapping midfight
[1:11:12] <%Faustgesicht> so lightning sword that has fire special move?
[1:11:17] <+MihriChan> God thats gonan be so good
[1:11:24] <+PrimalDweeb> Cool

[1:11:37] <Fro5tburn> Clap
[1:11:38] <grumblybunnys> should we avoid the pc build on launch or do we trust from soft this time?
[1:11:38] <Srthunda> great!
[1:11:38] <KnifeyMcEdge> NICE
[1:11:39] <%0dokuro> PvP sounds so diverse now with this
[1:11:39] <Bearheart223> YOOO THATS SICK
[1:11:39] <kazadaz> Does clothing offer meaningful protection?
[1:11:40] <KaironFortressKnight> Nice.
[1:11:40] <Qsmash_> seems like they really want you to experiment with builds this time
[1:11:40] <Drusain> Is it a PITA to level up this time? No fire keeper?
[1:11:41] <OneThousandTomatoes> can you pause the game easily? or just general do menu stuff without being afraid of dying
[1:11:41] <AllenDeadman> oh okay

[1:12:14] <Hypnotoad0823> @PatStaresAt Is there an equivalent to being hollowed/unkindled?
[1:12:15] <+griffball13> do you know the lore reason why you always come back after you die
[1:12:16] <%Vextalyst> did you find any good fire spells
[1:12:16] <Bearheart223> Did you shoot a meteor?
[1:12:17] <$theshadowproducer> what are incantations really tho?
[1:12:17] <Chatterbox1991> How much potential does this have to be the best souls game?
[1:12:17] <Vivirmos> Dragon's Dogma Souls?
[1:12:18] <%hax_metatron> The eventual Cinders mod for Elden Ring will be insane
[1:12:18] <%Sotetsu> Does mana regen naturally?
[1:12:19] <muetank> Can you upgrade your armor like back in DS1??
[1:12:22] <%0dokuro> Increase the number of pages in your head
[1:12:23] <%aBlueWizard> aBlueWizard subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 17 months! Man so many good games coming out early next year. gonna be crazy! excited to watch you bumblefuck your way through elden ring. Every one of your soulsbourne playthroughs has been gold.
[1:12:24] <Raz_Pataz> do the mini-dungeon bosses have the same boss music?
[1:12:26] <%SWFanatic> Bork
[1:12:26] <FloppytoKey> Can you block with your weapons?
[1:12:28] <@Ranryu692> so May, got it
[1:12:33] <+tactician0> I'm going dex/magic build for for sure
[1:12:37] <%bassoontyphoon> How are the starting kits?
[1:12:39] <Mattmandx1> 3-4 slots was the standard and required over a 20 point commitment to attunement. Always felt bad
[1:12:40] <Bearheart223> Pat did you shoot a meteor
[1:12:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> so if pyro and miracles are mixed, are they all cast with the same talisman or something simlar?
[1:12:43] <bone_reaper69> See any NPC's/quests?
[1:12:46] <+midnightmeatman> Leveling attunement was extra painful when you can't even get a new slot with the levels you have
[1:12:47] <%Broand> I heard equip load is STR based this time around
[1:12:47] <scrambledxeggz> Did you play the game in stream?
[1:12:49] <@QueequegTheater> You said earlier that it's like a greatest hits. What's the most notable influence from each game that you saw?
[1:12:55] <Daniel_Is_I> What.
[1:12:55] <Kalcom> does mind do anything else
[1:12:57] <%JamesCorck> Oh man, I don't mean to be an asshole because I mean this question sincerely and with a modicum of concern, is the dev team being crunched to get this game done?
[1:12:58] <T_Sasquatch> Wut
[1:12:58] <+Axellogic> I appear
[1:12:59] <+antpantz> WHAT?!
[1:12:59] <Vivirmos> Is the stability on two handed block better?
[1:13:05] <Hypnotoad0823> @PatStaresAt Is there an equivalent to being hollowed/unkindled?
[1:13:05] <jorniev> WHAT!?
[1:13:06] <$thesickestzak> Can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre changing all this stuff as Pat speaks because of „ÄåCRAZY TALK„Äç
[1:13:07] <+Fefe41> HIGH BOLIDE

[1:13:10] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> RAD
[1:13:10] <Punisherprime> @patstaresat how are the faith spells?
[1:13:10] <+Tsumikiro> @PatStaresAt does the tight level design hold up in a big open world?
[1:13:11] <JonnyJug> coxSteven
[1:13:11] <AllenDeadman> did you find the monkey?
[1:13:12] <+ZodiacWars> GOTY
[1:13:13] <+spartankzar> Pat did you dual wield and was it good
[1:13:15] <ferretking131> fuck yeah
[1:13:16] <%bread_assassin> @PatStaresAt How strong do you think a pure INT playthrough would be?
[1:13:18] <Crowroost> WHERE is the hidden sorcery vendor? :O
[1:13:18] <@QueequegTheater> SUCH DEVASTATION
[1:13:18] <%Faustgesicht> Did you use archery and if so, how did it feel?
[1:13:20] <+mecha_11> Everybody who's not going big daddy strength build is going dex/magic.
[1:13:20] <Fro5tburn> casual meteors LUL
[1:13:23] <CircleofSpines> Wow
[1:13:24] <%bassoontyphoon> oh thank god
[1:13:25] <blazekken> @patstaresat  does is the bloodborne?
[1:13:26] <+paladinstarbuster> LIKE MADARA
[1:13:26] <RubberFistFight> They've more than likely got the absolute bulk of the development finished, at this state it's just ironing out bugs, giving it polish and balance, and stabilising the various ports.
[1:13:26] <TigerClaws12> hey chat do we know if parry is active on frame 1? My stream keeps cutting out :(
[1:13:28] <AllenDeadman> you are "Maidenless"
[1:13:30] <+Freakin_Wolfy> Wasn't there some kind of Sekiro parry mechanic?

[1:13:36] <Seth_Tek> Pat Did you see the trailer for the new "Always sunny" season?
[1:13:37] <Tracazoid> "Your state of suckage is constant"- Elden Ring
[1:13:38] <jorniev> UNKINDLE THIS
[1:13:41] <Yamchadassist> pvp cosplay builds are gonna go crazy
[1:13:41] <%dekkitout> "Made of problems"?
[1:13:43] <%gupple_> Are there spell stat requirements?
[1:13:44] <jmft2000> Did You find NPC?
[1:13:44] <%barrakuta371> sick
[1:13:45] <+JaseAdrift> they are describing BOTW
[1:13:45] <@Ranryu692> oh, so it doesn't steal a chunk of your health bar if you don't want to play online?
[1:13:47] <iteruq> LUL
[1:13:50] <LorcaNomad> sounds lake a gamer complaint
[1:13:50] <medoodoo> I usually get lost in these types of games, in terms of navigation, linear aspects, is it less difficult to go from one place to another? And also, are there alot of npcs to interact with?
[1:13:51] <%chiazam> sephiroth
[1:13:53] <@QueequegTheater> They're farming hate clicks
[1:13:54] <cuckholdberry_finn> who even listens to journalists?
[1:13:55] <KnifeyMcEdge> OOOOOO
[1:13:55] <%bugz_munny> YEAH

[1:18:39] <Treasure_Vault> What's the biggest strength weapon you found?
[1:18:40] <%NeoCre> NeoCre subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 24 months! Will this game be called ‚Äúthe Dark Souls of Elder Scrolls‚Äù by game journos? A Dark Scrolls if you will?
[1:18:40] <ThePlayerHater> @PatStaresAt  were there any designated  pvp arenas?
[1:18:41] <%endyfilter> does it seem very shield heavy or can dex players enjoy it as well?

[1:19:18] <jacobknight13> are weapon arts A one time consumable
[1:19:18] <Bearheart223> Does gathering ingredients for crafting feel natural or like a chore
[1:19:19] <Teras_ode> spin 2 win

[1:19:26] <+bearman414> id ual wielding like ds2 or ds3
[1:19:27] <+midnightmeatman> Did you mess around with duel wielding? Do weapon arts swill work while power stancing?
[1:19:27] <jackistpayne> What about two handing? Did you test the move set using that?
[1:19:28] <@QueequegTheater> BORK
[1:19:29] <Capn_Bilge> do you share a hitbox/dmg with the horse when you're mounted?
[1:19:30] <Visorak6> @PatStaresAt were they any memorable/gimmick weapons?
[1:19:30] <%ouroborowski> good boy
[1:19:31] <conchthechimera> Are there still weapon stat requirements for wielding?

[1:19:34] <+polothegreatest> BegWan
[1:19:34] <+tentavision> Does the game straight up tell you what the stats do or did you have to figure it out yourself; ie, is it possible the stats do things you aren't aware of

[1:19:40] <+foomaster22> "speak!" "glflflf"

[1:20:05] <%JamesCorck> Is this game crunch free?
[1:20:08] <ThePlayerHater> @PatStaresAt  were there any designated  pvp arenas like D2?

[1:29:34] <%Smokebanshee> @patstaresat Did the game make much use of the fancy Dualsense controller stuff?
[1:29:37] <KaitlynnHere> I have a feeling that this isn‚Äôt my kind of game
[1:29:40] <%Sirtimbob> Anything jump out at you saying ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs George RR Martin‚Äù
[1:29:45] <Profmcstevie> Every number is gonna change FER SUUURE
[1:29:45] <topiodonk> yea, i thought so too
[1:29:51] <Press_X_ToJASON> progression based attunement slots PogChamp
[1:29:53] <%dekkitout> How many numbers will lie
[1:30:00] <heartlesshealer> yeah they will absolutely change boss stats after letting people see this network change
[1:30:06] <supergoblinpunch> Did it seem likely that the Feb release date is real?
[1:30:07] <DrFacilier> demons souls level?
[1:30:12] <Bearheart223> Which incantation
[1:30:15] <KaitlynnHere> @press_x_tojason x
[1:30:17] <+midnightmeatman> I hope they don't get nerfed into the dirt
[1:30:20] <heartlesshealer> network test, not change
[1:30:22] <jackistpayne> Yeah, the numbers never stay the same
[1:30:23] <DarthFreeman> @PatStaresAt Favorite little thing so-far?
[1:30:24] <$0ddeye> Overall impressions seems super high. As a Dark souls and high fantasy fan in general, I'm super pumped.  Does it feel like it might dethrone Bloodborne as the goat?
[1:30:24] <@QueequegTheater> HONEY IT'S 8 OCLOCK TIME TO NERF MIRACLES
[1:30:25] <%robotoken> Would you recommend Elden Ring or Sekiro for a first time souls game? I have never played a souls game but these have my interest.
[1:30:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> incantations is miracles/pyro right?
[1:30:26] <Raz_Pataz> you may have answered already, but could you see what level your premade character was?
[1:30:29] <Treasure_Vault> If they delay it, FINE
[1:30:32] <+Gorgodrn> @bearheart223 Beast Claw is the name. it is insane
[1:30:33] <%ChrisPlaysThing> december 20th the latest
[1:30:35] <%greasypete00> or marh 24/25
[1:30:38] <jetpack_rorschasch> I'm fine with that.
[1:30:42] <jackistpayne> At least we have monster hunter in jan
[1:30:42] <%hax_metatron> The last minute before the game goes out, Miyazaki shouts ‚Äî ‚ÄúNERF THAT ONE SPELL!‚Äù
[1:30:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> was the frame rate  consistent
[1:30:44] <mexsystem> did any boss have a unique gimmick that stood out?
[1:30:45] <%Kaask> elden ring
[1:30:49] <%WhereIsWill> play DS3
[1:30:50] <%FacetiousAF> FacetiousAF subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months, currently on a 35 month streak! congrats on doing some big influencing. speaking of hope you still have some hype in your heart for monster hunter rise on Steam
[1:30:52] <%SvenHolgersson> So Dark Souls 2?
[1:30:55] <topiodonk> god i hope this game runs at least a little good on the base ps4
[1:30:55] <Bearheart223> @Gorgodrn Oh they start with that, sheesh, yeah, seen some Iron Pineapple footage of it
[1:30:56] <%JoshManVGH> Has he already discussed what FP regeneration looks like outside of Flasks?
[1:30:57] <Vivirmos> Sekiro's really really like actually hard
[1:30:57] <+bearman414> were there any repeat enemies from other games or references to other from stuff
[1:30:59] <lemon_lover28> sekiro is the least soulsy souls game
[1:31:00] <Jrocy247> Start with DS3 honestly
[1:31:01] <%JamesCorck> Thank you for your honesty, Pat <3
[1:31:02] <jackistpayne> YET
[1:31:02] <%ChrisPlaysThing> marketing will have a SHIT, if the game isn't out for christmas
[1:31:03] <cuckholdberry_finn> does feet?
[1:31:05] <Profmcstevie> Sekiro and Elden Ring will NOT prepare you for anything souls, these are very freeing looking games
[1:31:07] <jackistpayne> HOW WOULD YOU KNOW
[1:31:12] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Do you think this is a "Paige friendly" game?
[1:31:14] <OneThousandTomatoes> Sekiro is the only souls game I've played and it was fun, and not too frustrating
[1:31:15] <%SvenHolgersson> Having a jump makes it so much easier at parts
[1:31:24] <fojidoj> I wouldn‚Äôt start with Sekiro, demands too much
[1:31:24] <jamsbybetty> Start with Dark Souls 1
[1:31:25] <+The_Death_Owl> They'll make it harder to spite pat before it releases doodScrub
[1:31:29] <fragdar> hoooooooow the hell bloodborne is the hardest
[1:31:30] <Archmortal> Sekiro is a tough recommend with no experience unless you really love the idea of sword clashing and like, maybe Ninja Gaiden for lack of a better comparison point
[1:31:31] <T_Sasquatch> Gascoigne is a BITCH
[1:31:31] <%WhereIsWill> over sekiro?
[1:31:32] <+swesterly> Sekiro is harder
[1:31:32] <%RayReborne> weird Bloodborne ia the only soulsborne game ive beaten lmao
[1:31:32] <%Sirtimbob> Harder than Bloodborne?
[1:31:33] <%FacetiousAF> @cuckholdberry_finn does feet is bad
[1:31:34] <%cobalt_phoenix_> really? interesting
[1:31:34] <bulgerwastaken> how does pyromancy/fire magic work?
[1:31:36] <Prevot> nah BB is the easiest
[1:31:36] <lemon_lover28> I haven't placed DLC but didn't find bloodborne very hard
[1:31:37] <Midnight188> Were there any invasion mechanics that you saw/encountered?
[1:31:37] <%endyfilter> sekiro I'd the hardest one
[1:31:39] <%Sirtimbob> Nvm, you just said
[1:31:39] <jamsbybetty> DS1 is broken but beautiful
[1:31:40] <ragasquid> sekiro is so hard wtf
[1:31:40] <%JoshManVGH> Thank god
[1:31:40] <Bearheart223> Does the jump have I-frames in pve?
[1:31:40] <%KnifeyMcEdge> I love everything about Bloodborne but i suck at it. I was FINE with Sekiro
[1:31:42] <heartlesshealer> I guess, since bloodborne is the fastest combat
[1:31:42] <%AncelDeLambert> Sekiro does'nt count, tho
[1:31:43] <%blaccbird914> bloodborne tries to kill you after the first door
[1:31:44] <+griffball13> I 100% bloodborne
[1:31:44] <+Ryandesu> Did you preorder the Premium Collectors Edition?
[1:31:45] <+Gorgodrn> I'm completely on the opposite end. Bloodborne was the easiest for me
[1:31:46] <RubberFistFight> Sekiro's WAY harder than Bloodborne, dude LUL
[1:31:46] <TheotherKristian> I just want bloodborne 60fps, that's all I want
[1:31:46] <@QueequegTheater> Depending on your definition of hard, DeS, DS2, BB, Sekiro, or DS3 could be the hardest
[1:31:46] <%MooseIsGoose> It was for me
[1:31:47] <+polothegreatest> buy all you coward LUL
[1:31:48] <pillworth> gun parries are too easy lmao
[1:31:48] <+purps26> sekiro is hardest for me
[1:31:48] <Treasure_Vault> I wish I got past the first ten minutes of Sekiro
[1:31:48] <+imadoc91> DS3 dlc was fucking hard, Bloodborne is probably the hardest across the board
[1:31:49] <%hax_metatron> Sekiro bruh
[1:31:49] <+Daedalus119> sekiro was way harder than bloodborne for me. I kicked the shit out of bloodborne but gave up on sekiro
[1:31:50] <faldin> sekiro is balls hard
[1:31:51] <Vivirmos> How did you find bloodborne harder than sekiro?
[1:31:51] <Shwepie> The hardest one is the first one you played.
[1:31:55] <Press_X_ToJASON> @lemon_lover28 dlc is the hardest part of the game
[1:31:55] <%AncelDeLambert> but yeah, BB is the hardest if only because of its DLC
[1:31:56] <Bearheart223> Does the jump have I-frames in pve
[1:31:58] <T_Sasquatch> Sekiro absolutely is harder
[1:31:59] <+extradopeness> sekiro is just punchout
[1:32:00] <+midnightmeatman> Sekiro is fun but it was basically a rhythm game. Def not the hardest.
[1:32:01] <ovan20> people who think it's like sekiro, send me what video you were watching LUL
[1:32:03] <fojidoj> Orphan of Kos intensifies
[1:32:03] <+MosesUnspoken> The end boss in Sekiro is the hardest thing in any souls game.
[1:32:03] <Archmortal> Sekiro is the hardest by default and the easiest to break wide open with tools it gives you
[1:32:06] <%Frost_Quill> Are fire spells just magic or a miracle or is it a separate thing?
[1:32:06] <TallYoda08> Sekiro for sure
[1:32:07] <+imadoc91> RIP
[1:32:09] <%Starotter70> More like Baby Borne psaDab BabyRage
[1:32:09] <+Arnoldoaad1> Sekiro is not the hardest
[1:32:10] <%Sotetsu> Sekiro was waaaay harder than Bloodborne
[1:32:11] <VioletRosefall> do invasions lock you in a room-area?
[1:32:11] <cuckholdberry_finn> Imma be real, i think BB is harder than sekiro
[1:32:12] <+DeadlyPeaks> Good, cuz I couldn‚Äôt beat seikiro
[1:32:12] <+griffball13> thats fair
[1:32:13] <Punisherprime> @PatStaresAt any really weird weapons?
[1:32:17] <%JoshManVGH> How quickly does FP regenerate without the use of Flasks?
[1:32:17] <vVAstrAVv> get fukd sekiro
[1:32:17] <heartlesshealer> oh no
[1:32:18] <Khester824> Did you find any trick weapons?
[1:32:19] <OneThousandTomatoes> sekiro is hard, but theres much more QoL
[1:32:20] <+alphonseisbest> oof
[1:32:20] <%greasypete00> based
[1:32:21] <%Kaask> sekiro isnt the weakest game of their souls-like games.
[1:32:22] <Vivirmos> Faiiiiiiiir enough
[1:32:22] <%AncelDeLambert> ugh...
[1:32:23] <+polothegreatest> oof
[1:32:23] <NeonBleu> Did you invade? Was it possible?
[1:32:24] <+Sindellah> Were Paired weapons in the game or are we Powerstancing now?
[1:32:28] <%hax_metatron> LUL
[1:32:28] <@QueequegTheater> DS3 is way harder than BB, chat is crazy
[1:32:30] <cuckholdberry_finn> SNAKE SHIELD
[1:32:30] <DrFacilier> the ape and isshin were the only real struggles
[1:32:31] <%cvp5127> @PatStaresAt was there weapon lore?
[1:32:31] <OneThousandTomatoes> well, theres QoL
[1:32:32] <%JoshManVGH> Oof
[1:32:33] <TREEMAN9999> snake shield weapon
[1:32:34] <%WhereIsWill> oof
[1:32:34] <Bearheart223> There's a shield thats a living snake in the network test
[1:32:35] <%Sotetsu> Sekiro isn't a Souls game.
[1:32:36] <Sarakin2> snake shield was cool. In iron pinnaples video i think it was.
[1:32:36] <TheButtravage> @PatStaresAt I've heard that invasions can only occur with a summon in your game, have you heard about this?
[1:32:37] <%AncelDeLambert> didn't learn anything from Cinders, huh?
[1:32:37] <+superchronicc> its a miracle that i can burn my enemies with holy fire
[1:32:38] <+tsamxxx> Did you fight George R R Martin?
[1:32:39] <%JoshManVGH> Neat!
[1:32:40] <+BignanasTheGawd> is there any way to get boss weapons?
[1:32:41] <Jrocy247> @PatStaresAt Does your Horse take damage and/or does it stay dead until you sit at bonfire.
[1:32:42] <LoudmicRPG> Sekiro is its own game, its not a DS game
[1:32:43] <RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt also Bloodborne is way harder if you go "Nah don't bother leveling strength or skill it's pointless." Kappa
[1:32:44] <+imadoc91> Snake shield
[1:32:45] <bulgerwastaken> did you find the snek shield?
[1:32:47] <lemon_lover28> @lemon_lover28 I have heard that but I still found the main game to be like not very hard
[1:32:48] <neekocheeko> im sure theres an mp regen ring
[1:32:50] <supergoblinpunch> Is the lore still in item descriptions
[1:32:50] <Daniel_Is_I> How frequent were those groups?
[1:32:50] <%delilah4you> Did you find the shield that was just a coiled snake that attacked dudes at range?
[1:32:51] <ovan20> @NeonBleu pat did no multiplayer
[1:32:52] <cuckholdberry_finn> Did u find snake sheild?
[1:32:53] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> so it's Dark Souls 3
[1:32:54] <Saltmeisterr> theres a snake whip shield
[1:32:56] <%KnifeyMcEdge> nice
[1:32:57] <Archmortal> Bloodborne only has one thing that makes anything in it harder than DS3 or Sekiro, and that's cursed chalices
[1:32:58] <Treasure_Vault> Can you kick?
[1:32:59] <+midnightmeatman> Did you mess around with the customizable flask?
[1:33:01] <+the_hidden_yeti> were there tons of weapons like DS3 or a smaller number of more meaningful, unique weapons like DS1?
[1:33:02] <LoudmicRPG> people shouldnt compare Sekiro as a DS game, because its not
[1:33:02] <%JoshManVGH> Oh that's pretty cool
[1:33:14] <%cvp5127> @PatStaresAt did the weapons have lore?
[1:33:15] <%Ynkubus_> Sekiro should be grouped with Froms other fuedal fantasy games not the souls games
[1:33:18] <+bearman414> were there any repeat enemies from other games or references to other fromsoft stuff
[1:33:18] <g0rgeousfreeman> @Sindellah powerstance is back and it looks crazy
[1:33:21] <jamsbybetty> Can you cut grass with your sword  or knock over pillars or other environmental collateral?
[1:33:21] <Visorak6> Do you pick the ratio of health to mana flasks you have like DS3?
[1:33:22] <dyllustrate> Do open world enemies repopulate?
[1:33:27] <vVAstrAVv> do flasks heal a percentage or need upgrades????

[1:37:41] <+tentavision> Goats are great climbers dude

[1:38:46] <$realm_forge> APPLY HORSE PASTE

[1:38:53] <@ssjklyco> Can you name him Roach
[1:38:53] <conchthechimera> How much more "BERSERKish" was this compared to DS?
[1:38:54] <Tracazoid> Not yet, someone might find a way
[1:38:55] <+doug_famous> Does Torrent have any upgrades/equipment?
[1:38:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I too would like to pet my steed.
[1:38:57] <qaaj> Did you encounter a Fromsoft poison swamp?
[1:38:57] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[1:38:58] <Raz_Pataz> does it automatically comsume the flask to bring Torrent back?
[1:39:01] <%Frost_Quill> Can't wait for the mandatory poison swamp.
[1:39:05] <%MooseIsGoose> Awesome
[1:39:10] <DirtyMerlin> noice
[1:39:11] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I saw Vatii Yoshi him up
[1:39:12] <+extradopeness> hes more like a goat than a horse i think
[1:39:14] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Any big DS2 references
[1:39:17] <cuckholdberry_finn> ya like minors pat?
[1:39:17] <robintact> @PatStaresAt Is having an actual jump button change combat enough for a souls hardcore?
[1:39:18] <Vivirmos> Oh god
[1:39:21] <+Axellogic> Any Phalanx boys?
[1:39:22] <digaogrunge> Chances for a BoW style glider? @PatStaresAt
[1:39:23] <graemecrackers2> Miner? I hardly know her
[1:39:25] <SoulKingCrazzmatazz> @PatStaresAt did you hear about the new repentance patches in binding of isaac?
[1:39:29] <SoulKingCrazzmatazz> lottttt of great fixes
[1:39:29] <qaaj> Were you allowed to traverse the obligatory poison swamp?
[1:39:31] <%WhereIsWill> How does this fit in with the rest? @PatStaresAt
[1:39:31] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> How much you gonna bet that The Moonlight GreatSword exists somewhere in Elden Ring
[1:39:32] <%DovaDude29> @patstaresat what are the pc requirements? My pc is only a year old but I worry
[1:39:39] <DirtyMerlin> See any Pot Guys??
[1:39:39] <captain_kirkhammer> Did you try sliding down a ladder wearing the dumb helmet thing to see if you go clink clink clink like that meme video?
[1:39:39] <Hypnotoad0823> @PatStaresAt Is summoning Torrent a usable item or a dedicated button?
[1:39:39] <OneThousandTomatoes> status effects builds the same way as always right?
[1:39:39] <Pyon84> Max said the game is quite dark, this true?
[1:39:41] <+BloodyBurney> do you feel like damage types will be more important generally or just in side areas?
[1:39:47] <slipdog> patches too
[1:39:48] <+BignanasTheGawd> what do you get after beating a boss?
[1:39:50] <primaryfire> it wasnt in sekiro
[1:39:51] <dmtjinni> NOOOO
[1:39:54] <Drusain> Did you get hit by a rolling ball?
[1:39:55] <+Roundelay11> only a thousand?
[1:39:55] <cureneckbeard> Crazy Talk activate
[1:39:56] <%Tearonex> It's going to be in there
[1:39:56] <Raz_Pataz> only that much?
[1:39:57] <@Ranryu692> how much would you bet that it's actually good this time?
[1:39:59] <personalityoverload> Was there any healing outside of miracles and flasks, like life gems in ds2?
[1:40:00] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> True
[1:40:00] <AphelocomaC> is armor defense important like in dark souls, or is it more like bloodborne
[1:40:02] <Dr_Mooose> they'll find a way
[1:40:03] <slipdog> LUL
[1:40:05] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt So 200 subs then
[1:40:05] <%TwistParabola> were they in sekiro though?
[1:40:06] <Baeltyr> moonlights  even in armoured core
[1:40:06] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I bet it'll have a rad moveset this time too
[1:40:08] <LoudmicRPG> Sekiro is not a DS game, cmon guys
[1:40:08] <+Tucker0603> IT WAS IN SEKIRO
[1:40:09] <senfood> @PatStaresAt Any lore implications you discovered that you found particularly interesting?
[1:40:10] <%Bluwizard21> could u have?
[1:40:11] <%Frost_Quill> Oh shit I can't wait to take the Moonlight's weapon art and putting it on a spear or something.
[1:40:11] <%asgard147> But WHO will you have to kill to get it this time?
[1:40:11] <Vivirmos> Patches wasn't in DS2, so maybe
[1:40:11] <@QueequegTheater> Do it pussy
[1:40:13] <LoudmicRPG> stop saying Sekiro is a DS game
[1:40:16] <%itsKrisD> @primaryfire dragon boss has it
[1:40:17] <vile_brand> what about covenants?
[1:40:17] <+SkitsofRandom> wheel skeletons?
[1:40:17] <Archmortal> here's the wrinkle to betting on MLGS: you have to wait till DLC is all out before confirming if it isn't
[1:40:17] <+Namillus> there's one shield weapon art
[1:40:17] <%ConLin_Arts_> where there skeletons????
[1:40:18] <Press_X_ToJASON> wouldnt be souls without patches (stares at DS2)
[1:40:18] <%delilah4you> Were there any crystal lizards?
[1:40:19] <%MooseIsGoose> If you can tell a dev let them know the goat mount is awesome and we love him
[1:40:20] <+Arnoldoaad1> are there traps?
[1:40:20] <%codedoomboy> Just follow the moonlight
[1:40:21] <+griffball13> @PatStaresAt would you say them mini dungeons you find are like challice dungeons from bloodborne
[1:40:21] <Daniel_Is_I> Did you get kicked off a cliff by a skeleton?
[1:40:23] <%tank7013> Nah it wont be the moonlight greatsword it'll be the greatmoon lightsword or some shit
[1:40:28] <primaryfire> @LoudmicRPG the moonlight greatsword is not a souls thing, it's a fromsoft thing
[1:40:30] <@QueequegTheater> @Vivirmos Pate was basically Patches, and 2 wasn't Miyazaki anyway
[1:40:30] <Bearheart223> Dung Beetles!
[1:40:31] <vivaciouseff> @primaryfire i had always assumed the divine dragon was wielding a moonlight greatsword equivalent
[1:40:33] <LoudmicRPG> Sekiro is its own thing and wants to be its own thing
[1:40:34] <dmtjinni> SKELETONS????? @PatStaresAt
[1:40:34] <+SnorlaxBud> yay lizards
[1:40:34] <icefireinfinite> Did you get hit by rolling skeletons?

[1:59:43] <+Schlager087> Schlager087 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! Hey Pat, sorry if I missed this answer, but would you recommend PC or PS5?
[1:59:44] <Bearheart223> @TheRossySauce Drop currency and respawn at "bonfire" or close to boss if died to boss
[1:59:46] <cureneckbeard> SKELETON WARRIORS
[1:59:47] <+EonKain> weapon skills but actually good.
[1:59:51] <+TheRossySauce> where do you respawn lol qwq
[1:59:56] <+paladinstarbuster> Dragons dogma is pretty big too
[1:59:56] <dan_g_v> very Zelda
[1:59:59] <%asgard147> Double Tap
[2:00:33] <+EonKain> Goblin Slayer darkness
[2:00:34] <Jerp> @TheRossySauce so you respawn close to the boss instead of at a bonfire?
[2:00:38] <%asgard147> MOSS
[2:00:40] <Prevot> the DS2 that we didn't get
[2:00:44] <heartlesshealer> MOSS
[2:00:50] <graemecrackers2> silky
[2:00:55] <%Schlager087> hooooooolay that weapon is making me want to do a dex run through the series
[2:01:13] <@QueequegTheater> Scholar definitely got it closer but not all the way
[2:01:25] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Holy shit
[2:01:25] <%Gamblitz> I know its kind of the Appeal, but can From Software update the its HUD to give it its own Identity
[2:01:28] <Bearheart223> @TheRossySauce Bosses have shrines nearby them, whenever you pass by one you'll get respawned on it instead of on a bonfire. Makes the runback to the boss much quicker
[2:01:31] <James_Quivers> GOONED

[2:01:54] <%Dakuu75> JESUS
[2:02:13] <+TheRossySauce> rip horse
[2:02:14] <Prevot> those bars on the hud look pretty basic
[2:02:20] <baltazar758> RaccAttack
[2:02:37] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Damn
[2:02:41] <Bearheart223> @Prevot Possibly W.I.P as its not the final product
[2:02:45] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, the colors are pretty flat on the hud
[2:02:48] <ToneBacas> the bars are bars, yes
[2:02:55] <Solar_Pancake97> i thought that said Linga cave
[2:02:55] <+Kiaayo> i forgot how cool pat is when he actually has time to think about the words coming out of his mouth
[2:02:59] <heartlesshealer> the bars are okay
[2:02:59] <Khester824> So there's no more carry weight in this?
[2:03:05] <%WhereIsWill> so many xbows
[2:03:19] <heartlesshealer> making the green of bar not blend with all the other greens of the game is important
[2:03:25] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> DAMN LUL
[2:03:36] <%AncelDeLambert> ... so we're gonna need multiple weapons like it's D&D
[2:03:46] <majdsaade1> guys be honest with me, is this 30 mins of pat dying over and over again?
[2:03:48] <+Dumb_Parrot> Even the You Died is Dark Souls heh
[2:03:48] <ToneBacas> if anything, i wonder if the colors on the bars are ok for color-blind people
[2:03:52] <stub_master> havel zentrePOGZ
[2:03:59] <+TheRossySauce> thats rad
[2:04:04] <BionicPulga> kimreiLUL
[2:04:04] <%AncelDeLambert> you're first mistake was second-handing the staff
[2:04:05] <Bearheart223> oh that death was bullshit
[2:04:06] <NeonBleu> death by shield
[2:04:09] <+twohitgood> @majdsaade1 no. just 15 minutes.
[2:04:09] <%mostbrokenrobo> That's a really well trained horse
[2:04:14] <PwnyB> @Prevot Normally this is a bullshit statement, but in this case, it's fair. lol I don't expect them to change (they look fine to me) but, bars are very easy to stylize. lol
[2:04:14] <+NobuuNobuu> is this pre recorded or lice commentary?
[2:04:16] <%Schlager087> Reminds me of the literal 2nd enemy of Nioh 2
[2:04:17] <+HuoShengdi> wow that last one
[2:04:21] <@QueequegTheater> That is straight up Havel with the Pursuer shield and Gyoubu's moveset

[2:05:18] <heartlesshealer> changing targets before the spell finishes casting changes spell target, cool
[2:05:23] <+paladinstarbuster> Everybody should play dragons dogma
[2:05:30] <@QueequegTheater> @heartlesshealer That's always been true

[2:06:16] <@QueequegTheater> @Shwepie >he thinks DD2 is real
[2:06:16] <+LevelUpSlick> wedder
[2:06:18] <PwnyB> @Schlager087 No, but magic seems to be reasonably balanced and viable. You can also regain flasks by clearing overworld mobs.
[2:06:18] <+Dives__> Long may the Burger King reign
[2:06:19] <TheRealNumberJ42> the jank is real
[2:06:20] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> so basically Teostra armor, I'm sorry I said it, Teostra armor is a Burger King employee outfit I'm sorry
[2:06:20] <graemecrackers2> promotion with BK and ER in the future ?
[2:06:23] <Bearheart223> @Shwepie more like 2024 century NotLikeThis
[2:06:25] <+hey_an0n> burger King dad
[2:06:30] <+Kango234> Did he already answer if there is a questline to follow or do you just do whatever like Breath of the Wild?
[2:06:32] <+twohitgood> r2 strikes up...noted.

[2:06:33] <@QueequegTheater> Elden Onion Rings
[2:06:36] <graemecrackers2> BK Edition

[2:06:52] <Blastotron> The deer gets guns at night
[2:06:54] <@QueequegTheater> Carthas caverns
[2:06:59] <Prevot> wonder if you can see the great deku tree from all the areas in the game
[2:06:59] <%Schlager087> @PwnyB Thanks for the reply, i figured passive regen would make magic way too busted
[2:07:01] <+zaishade> DS3 catacombs
[2:07:03] <%Gamblitz> BIG HEAD MODE!
[2:07:13] <stub_master> skeleton ball incoming
[2:07:15] <@QueequegTheater> I bet there will be a Shrine of Amana dungeon

[2:07:45] <PwnyB> @Schlager087 NP. I'd rather a SUPER slow passive regen, but, eh, split your estus and just don't get hit. :>
[2:07:45] <%AncelDeLambert> hey, you can block flamethrowers with your shield enough to squeeze past, that's good
[2:07:50] <Maya_Hett> curse lizards inc

[2:07:59] <%Nope80808> Larry Bundy Jr. Flame

[2:08:23] <rcand9> thats sick
[2:08:23] <%AncelDeLambert> game big
[2:08:25] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> yo these lil guys are the lil thieves from DS3
[2:08:26] <DracaenaLeaf> oh hey it it the burger king
[2:08:40] <+zaishade> Is that headpiece gonna be part of the new giant dad build?
[2:08:42] <%AncelDeLambert> hopefully game not DS2 big, though. That's too big
[2:08:56] <%AncelDeLambert> ugh
[2:08:59] <@QueequegTheater> They both held up way better than a lot of other 2010/2011 games
[2:09:07] <rcand9> hell yes
[2:09:09] <Khester824> It's like Skyrim with Dark Souls
[2:09:14] <%AncelDeLambert> hello dragon
[2:09:15] <%Gamblitz> The Red Dead Redemption of Dark Souls
[2:09:15] <Maya_Hett> Dwagon time

[2:09:24] <ConflagrationsGaming> DRAGUN
[2:09:28] <$realm_forge> I recently played Skyrim with DBZ power mods
[2:09:29] <+zaishade> The Dark Souls of Skyrim
[2:09:30] <%AncelDeLambert> dragon jousting sounds good
[2:09:31] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> why do video game companies suddenly think male and female don't exist?
[2:09:32] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Fatalis
[2:09:33] <rcand9> he cool
[2:09:34] <PwnyB> That dragon coming in is such a solid moment. lol

[2:09:42] <+OneGorillionDollars> "It's skyrim but without the heart" - IGN
[2:09:57] <+zaishade> Of course it's lightning as the weakness
[2:10:00] <+eanscrale> LiiiiIIGHTNing!
[2:10:14] <%Schlager087> So my only question about this game is PC or PS5?
[2:10:16] <@QueequegTheater> HOW'S IT FEEL, SEATH?
[2:10:19] <%AncelDeLambert> I just wanna give my poor brain a break and successfully pelt my enemy with magic from a distance
[2:10:20] <@QueequegTheater> TO BE A BIIITCH
[2:10:21] <+amUusTV> How's it feel, Agheel?
[2:10:22] <WizardofWazz> 1.05 patch save us

[2:10:47] <%AncelDeLambert> god can you IMAGINE what Cinders will look like for this?
[2:10:52] <Dave_VD> The real question is can you just go straight to the last boss
[2:10:56] <+zaishade> Plague of Gripes is a cultural treasure
[2:10:58] <%ErikFeral> Strafing while in menus givin me kh2 flashbacks
[2:11:00] <Jrocy247> I can't wait to use that Twinblade
[2:11:00] <Prevot> hope they get some BB trick weapons in this game
[2:11:01] <%AncelDeLambert> a shit-ton of what Cinders is will probably carry over to this, too
[2:11:02] <+thecowpow> dogs are so fluffy!
[2:11:09] <%studleydoorite> good ole Dog Souls
[2:11:10] <KyaputenFarukon> these enemies are cute

[2:11:20] <0cash> god this game seems so fun. fuck
[2:11:29] <%AncelDeLambert> wait, you can ad-hoc apply lightning to your weapon as a physical build?
[2:11:37] <@QueequegTheater> yes
[2:11:50] <+marquezpsp> this Rise PC port looking great
[2:11:56] <+zaishade> Daaaang, that will save so much menu management overhead
[2:11:59] <%AncelDeLambert> like, not as an item eg lightning pine?
[2:12:05] <@QueequegTheater> yes
[2:12:09] <rcand9> whats the biggest thing that sekiro brought to elden ring if anything at all?
[2:12:12] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Damn holy shit Fatalis already on Rise PC port?
[2:12:13] <PwnyB> @marquezpsp Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:12:13] <%AncelDeLambert> huh
[2:12:13] <cureneckbeard> dunno if it's a good idea for a game to name a mount after a piracy tool
[2:12:14] <+itsgundamu> !uptime
[2:12:14] <+Arnoldoaad1> There is the katana, i didnt notice it before
[2:12:14] <@Moobot> @itsgundamu I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 12m.
[2:12:15] <+zaishade> Or maybe add more of it, depending on implementation...
[2:12:20] <shockmaster3> can you cut the tail off the dragon?
[2:12:30] <@QueequegTheater> @AncelDeLambert You can also apply the scaling to JUST the weapon art if you want
[2:12:32] <%AncelDeLambert> I wonder how builds will look...
[2:12:40] <+AlucardX60> @rcand9 jump button
[2:12:47] <+zaishade> @cureneckbeard Lmao
[2:12:56] <%Gamblitz> use Quen to defend yourself
[2:12:57] <Prevot> @cureneckbeard you wouldn't download a horse
[2:12:58] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, there it was
[2:13:03] <+smacksfenton> Seeing a lot of old assets/moves again. This guy reminds me a lot of Nameless Kihg's mount. Don't know how I feel about it.
[2:13:04] <xxshadowxx416> I wish they would make a mmo
[2:13:12] <bear_breaker20> oh damn dragons fights look like THAT now?!
[2:13:12] <+gitgouda> cant wait to see what we can do with those twin swords
[2:13:17] <%AncelDeLambert> dude, that was just the Charge Blade sheath attack LUL
[2:13:29] <PwnyB> @shockmaster3 People have been trying but so far the answer has been "No, but maybe just not in the Network Test b/c they might want to keep lore hidden"
[2:13:36] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Damn Lightning fucked him up
[2:13:49] <rcand9> oh hes an angry boy
[2:13:49] <+zaishade> Definitely seeing a lot of recycled moves. I mean, it's not unexpected, but still.
[2:14:04] <Profmcstevie> recycling is good for the planet
[2:14:16] <+NobuuNobuu> dude carries the sword just for show
[2:14:19] <%AncelDeLambert> moonlight wave, fuck ye
[2:14:30] <+zaishade> reduce, reuse, recycle
[2:14:35] <Shwepie> Recycling helps prevent crunch.
[2:14:36] <%optimasmaximas> Pat getting bodied here
[2:14:40] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, so sorcery has options for damage types, that's... weird
[2:14:42] <shockmaster3> is it just me or does it seem like the magic looks better in this game?
[2:14:48] <rcand9> ohh
[2:14:49] <%Schlager087> Ah, you were beside me all along
[2:14:54] <%AncelDeLambert> the magic is very pretty
[2:15:02] <Profmcstevie> special effects do look nice overall
[2:15:05] <+zaishade> particle effects are nice
[2:15:08] <%AncelDeLambert> soul arrows have that shadow show up above you, that's nice
[2:15:12] <0cash> more importantly, magic looks more useful
[2:15:16] <%Nope80808> Poisebois are back yall
[2:15:17] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> this mfker pulled out the sword liike that bloodborne boss
[2:15:20] <Profmcstevie> Strong lighting and particle competence
[2:15:26] <%Schlager087> oh man, the Camera clips through enemies? peeeeeeeeeeeeerfect
[2:15:30] <PwnyB> Hoping for a Quarter-staff or Fist Weapons being useful ;w;
[2:15:34] <%AncelDeLambert> it'll be nice to not beat my own brain to death fighting bosses
[2:15:38] <rcand9> horn dude
[2:15:40] <BrownMcgee> miyazaki classic
[2:15:44] <+Dives__> Magic is looking much more interesting. I think I'll choose a Prophet. Wheel neck gang rise up!
[2:15:57] <jorniev> OK THIS gives me dragons dogma vives
[2:15:59] <%AncelDeLambert> man, Cinders spoiled the fuck out of us with some of its battle staff weapons
[2:16:00] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> omg

[2:17:45] <@QueequegTheater> @0cash block attack
[2:17:46] <PwnyB> Rurikhan also confirmed that shield kicking is the weapon art of unarmed combat. Hoping there's some robustness there.

[2:19:03] <@QueequegTheater> @PortableBoredom They haven't changed it since DeS, why would they start now
[2:19:14] <%BinaryFireball> also that bullshit on twitter about the jumping horse is bullshit, that was a wind well
[2:19:15] <%G_Thunders> His moves remind me of Gael but just slowed down some
[2:19:29] <+tactician0> thats a sekiro boss
[2:19:33] <+amUusTV> Mans using main character combos on you
[2:19:36] <PortableBoredom> I thought Elden Ring was it's own thing and not a Dark Souls 4.5 HD Remix
[2:19:37] <%AncelDeLambert> ... FUCKING HAMMER OF THE GODS!
[2:19:40] <stub_master> dank spirits, not dark souls Kappa
[2:19:42] <lealea4> literally DS4 and that's PERFECT
[2:19:45] <+zaishade> was that the hammer/sword thing from bloodborne?!
[2:19:45] <%AncelDeLambert> I CALL UPON THE POWER OF THOR!

[2:19:52] <+beardy_foxbear> I bet you can cut his tail
[2:19:54] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> Holy shit man you can block again in this game, unlike Ds3 where your stamina gets fucked
[2:19:59] <+itsgundamu> bro this guy's moveset is fucking sick
[2:20:08] <rcand9> imagine getting mad about more dark souls
[2:20:08] <@QueequegTheater> @PortableBoredom This company makes one game, and will keep making it
[2:20:16] <+cdrom321> Later, you fight his brother, Fugit.
[2:20:17] <%BinaryFireball> its weird but Im kinda done with wanting to fight bosses in souls like games
[2:20:19] <%WhereIsWill> these MIXUPS
[2:20:26] <0cash> the light weapons are so cool
[2:20:30] <ConflagrationsGaming> and the new coats of paint and new monster designs? fine by me, beautiful
[2:20:32] <%tanarath> It's a good game
[2:20:34] <%Nope80808> Ds4/Kingsfield 3
[2:20:42] <Prevot> this is actually the 5th game in the Demon's Souls series
[2:20:42] <+zaishade> @BinaryFireball I feel that way too
[2:20:46] <%AncelDeLambert> @BinaryFireball it's not weird you're not alone, it's become torture in a very real sense
[2:20:48] <%mostbrokenrobo> time 4 gangbang
[2:20:48] <stub_master> the jobber summoning
[2:20:59] <Shwepie> @BinaryFireball Yeah, I'm more excited for the open world fighting and exploration.
[2:21:01] <PortableBoredom> Fair enough. I've never been interested in Souls since all my experiences with them were awful, so I'll doing my best to ignore the internet freaking out about this for the next year or two.
[2:21:04] <%BinaryFireball> good to know im not alone lol
[2:21:06] <@QueequegTheater> Less than 20 seconds lmao

[2:21:51] <%BinaryFireball> or just some magic?
[2:21:56] <@QueequegTheater> @AncelDeLambert No. You learn to fight him.
[2:21:57] <%AncelDeLambert> I hope so
[2:21:59] <@QueequegTheater> Kappa
[2:22:01] <shockmaster3> do you think they will make the defensive strike take stamina so people don't abuse it?
[2:22:07] <+trackles_64> Can he jump off the edge?
[2:22:12] <%AncelDeLambert> psaPat
[2:22:13] <%BinaryFireball> I wanna snipe bosses and laugh
[2:22:20] <PwnyB> @BinaryFireball I've heard Archery is okay, but I've yet to actually see footage of it.
[2:22:25] <@QueequegTheater> @AncelDeLambert nagYou git gud
[2:22:27] <+zaishade> @shockmaster3 It might be like Sekiro... R2 dance
[2:22:31] <%BinaryFireball> ahh
[2:22:32] <%AncelDeLambert> NEVER
[2:22:35] <%AncelDeLambert> YOU CAN'T MAKE ME!
[2:22:37] <%BinaryFireball> maybe pat will show some then
[2:22:38] <stub_master> but does it have tarkus?
[2:22:39] <roobanguy> i really like the longsword animations
[2:22:39] <junekoj> need gameplay that isn't holding up your shield and circlestrafing all day
[2:22:40] <%AncelDeLambert> I DEMAND TO BABY!
[2:22:40] <Profmcstevie> The basic archery in the Bamco 19 minutes of gameplay seemed competent
[2:22:41] <roobanguy> they look good
[2:22:51] <+N0LimitBreak> so cool
[2:22:52] <@QueequegTheater> @AncelDeLambert nagMe cant, but Miyazaki can LUL
[2:22:59] <@QueequegTheater> NO BABY
[2:23:05] <Shwepie> @BinaryFireball Pat never used a ranged weapon sadly.
[2:23:08] <PwnyB> @BinaryFireball Nope. This is the second running of a pre-recorded segment. :> Sorry bud.
[2:23:12] <Dave_VD> How much of the summoning mechanic have they shown? Does anyone know how it works?
[2:23:14] <%AncelDeLambert> I've played your games, From, now have mercy on me
[2:23:18] <%MrChapwhit> death by 1000 cuts isn't quite as entertaining as "Bonk, Smash, Crash"
[2:23:21] <%BinaryFireball> ah no worries
[2:23:21] <%mostbrokenrobo> Pat advice: don't let enemy hit you
[2:23:22] <%G_Thunders> It‚Äôs kinda weird that you can‚Äôt see a stagger gauge like in Sekiro, but it works exactly like Sekiro
[2:23:28] <willyfreshness> its so weird to not have Pat playing off of anyone
[2:23:29] <TioXyco> huh, it's archer with Tracing

[2:24:21] <PwnyB> @Dave_VD Summoning is limited to bosses and specific encounters if I'm not mistaken but, not in simpler basic encounters. It takes a chunk of FP but is pretty worth for what I've seen.

[2:33:56] <%blastyoboots> hehe
[2:33:57] <@QueequegTheater> @BinaryFireball But cowboys don't use swords
[2:34:02] <%DiscoMatador> Dargon Soulgma
[2:34:11] <%ThirdWelles> I want bigger, more horrid mimics
[2:34:13] <Nootyman> @BinaryFireball the word you're looking for is Hunt:Showdown
[2:34:15] <%ThirdWelles> I'm sorry
[2:34:22] <%ThirdWelles> ARMORED CORE had a moonlight greatsword?
[2:34:29] <Profmcstevie> I hope the Moonlight Greatsword is in a giant tree

[2:34:38] <@QueequegTheater> @ThirdWelles Dude, King's Field had one
[2:34:39] <dimensaur> it's gonna be hard to beat the Bloodborne MLGS reveal
[2:34:40] <primaryfire> yeah it's a recurring from soft thing, not just souls
[2:34:43] <dinnydanny777> Armored Core has a Moonlight laser blade

[2:35:05] <majdsaade1> do you think elden ring is gonna be the witcher 3 of the open world dark souls breath of the wild type games?
[2:35:07] <%RayReborne> i kinda want to see how Fromsoft does at making a game that is Radically different or a completely different genre of game than Soulsborne. it would be interesting
[2:35:08] <%ThirdWelles> @QueequegTheater THAT'S RAD! I  didn't realize it was more than just the souls series
[2:35:10] <ralphfromdk> PS4 for those glorious 15 fps...
[2:35:14] <rcand9> i cant wait for them to tie framerate to everything
[2:35:21] <%BinaryFireball> I need to get past 3...
[2:35:22] <%thedankestmeeme> Here's  the hard hitting question @PatStaresAt does it look worst than Demon souls?atleast top of it's genre?
[2:35:28] <%texaporte> word is 60fps lock on pc :(
[2:35:29] <@QueequegTheater> My choices are this middling laptop or a PS5, gee I wonder which one I'm buying it on KappaHD
[2:35:32] <%BinaryFireball> yakuza 3 is fucking hard after yhou play the remasters
[2:35:33] <%ThirdWelles> Sekiro
[2:35:37] <%baka_sugoi> x 2 jup
[2:35:49] <%Cozy90> X PS or xobx?
[2:35:51] <%blastyoboots> yeah, but it doesn't need to
[2:35:55] <Profmcstevie> Technically yes, artistically hell no
[2:35:55] <Coystick> Artstyle>>>>>>>raw graphics
[2:35:56] <%ThirdWelles> Does it PLAY better than Demons Souls tho?
[2:36:02] <rcand9> but demon souls looks bananas good tbf

[2:36:25] <%G_Thunders> I was just a little disappointed that they didn‚Äôt use DeS Remake‚Äôs heavier sound effects for magic
[2:36:27] <%SaiyanShoto> My one complaint is that Elden Ring graphically just looks like dark souls 3
[2:36:27] <dan_g_v> yeeyeye
