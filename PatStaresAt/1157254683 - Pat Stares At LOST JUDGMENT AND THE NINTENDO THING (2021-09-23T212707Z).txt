[0:53:58] <superchunk121> Fusion or zero mission
[0:53:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> why are they calling everything "the ___ game"
[0:53:59] <%DianaTheAscian> You are
[0:53:59] <sjcodan> FUSION
[0:54:00] <Galacta_Pieta> Super metroid is understandable to a degree cause its controls are bad
[0:54:00] <HirsuteBrute> Super Metroid but with a QoL mod to make it play more like the GBA ones
[0:54:01] <+Scevda> FUCK OFF
[0:54:01] <+0neReeler> FUSION
[0:54:02] <+pectusumbra> Fusion would be the answer in this case I assume
[0:54:02] <+ATorL> Samus Returns was pretty good
[0:54:03] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> just play whatever you feel like
[0:54:03] <%Th0ms0nStuart> that hard cut to a website address vo line was weird
[0:54:03] <%Ipsenscastle> the jumping will always feel horrible regardless

[0:54:04] <hearingthenseeing> 3ds was fun

[0:54:07] <+SmartAssPawn089> If you like Hollow Knight, you're good with the 2D ones
[0:54:07] <BoneofMalkav> Zero Mission and Fusion are always good places to start

[0:54:10] <PanicSwytch> GBA PLEASE
[0:54:11] <%TrafficCohen> Fusion but don't emulate iit on your phone
[0:54:11] <+PettyFunk> I think they're pushing a bunch of trailers because they assume a lot of kids with Switches have never played the old mainline Metroid games
[0:54:11] <cbdhempwraps> here it comes, y’all

[1:31:08] <devanmuse> kick the pope in his balls. that'll get you excommunicated
[1:31:09] <chimeraxmachina> So chatolisism is a blood curse
[1:31:11] <willyfreshness> This has nothing to do with the mystery of the sugar baby
[1:31:12] <nickjura> CATH-19
[1:31:13] <icefireinfinite> Definitely Pat first, but then Paige trips into his grave while mourning.

[1:32:02] <Pt_Kamen> No
[1:32:03] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Spanish Catholicism was fucked up.  Most of us don't even go to Church
[1:32:03] <@Ranryu692> the Catholic Church has perpetrated more evil than any other organization in history
[1:32:04] <+paladinstarbuster> no
[1:32:05] <Astrophizz> it's by birth
[1:32:06] <%MidnightBurst12> real life rts conversions
[1:32:07] <gespenst25> It's a LOT more complicated
[1:32:07] <+vaderxyz1970> Mother has to be Jewish
[1:32:08] <+Vigonept> it takes time but eventually
[1:32:09] <nickjura> DID YOU LEARN THIS FROM MARK TWAIN PAT?
[1:32:10] <DatAsuna> judaism is famoously hard to convert to
[1:32:11] <+Arxel1> no
[1:32:11] <%ElectricEmissary> Judaism you need to be rejected three times
[1:32:14] <%brave_the_earth> you can convert to judaism
[1:32:15] <teefpal> It's a lot tougher to convert
[1:32:15] <%Monkeyweed21> this is Catholic exclusive tech
[1:32:17] <%deadbeat34> nope, conversion takes a year and a half
[1:32:17] <TravinoEXE> nonconsentual catholicism, good god
[1:32:20] <%RealThiele> Catholicism says no
[1:32:20] <Treasure_Vault> None of it is real so whatever you like
[1:32:20] <+BIumen> is this about chris pratt
[1:32:23] <%ElectricEmissary> and then the rabbi will accept on the fourth time
[1:32:27] <$lotharrio> It was only really recently that they even "accepted" converts.
[1:32:27] <%FunkyStreams> mom
[1:32:27] <teefpal> Nah conversions count
[1:32:30] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Judiasm is VERY difficult to convert into

[1:32:33] <%FunkyStreams> yes
[1:32:34] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Judaism is from the moms side
[1:32:34] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Jew-Gate
[1:32:34] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Converted Catholics are still considered Catholic under the Church
[1:32:36] <%akscully> always know who your mom is, not necessarily your father
[1:32:37] <OneThousandTomatoes> religion is stupid, the end
[1:32:37] <%RealThiele> i failed my conversion class :(
[1:32:39] <%ElectricEmissary> like, the point is you really have to want to convert
[1:32:39] <DatAsuna> judaism says you have to be turned away 3 times
[1:32:43] <%deadbeat34> Judaism is non-evangelical
[1:32:43] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Just how it is
[1:32:44] <%stantheman_97> Judaism is more exclusive and sometimes ethnic, depending on who you ask
[1:32:44] <Yukai_Yami> "Lost Judgement", talk of Catholicism and Judaism. I mean, it's not WRONG...
[1:32:45] <+Vigonept> whyd he marry a non jew

[1:32:55] <%Piemono> You can't guarantee you know your dad, its easier to know who your mom is
[1:32:55] <+SommenRider> it's easier to trace maternity because a kid can only come out of one possible mother
[1:32:55] <%ThomasOfTroy> @PatStaresAt Fathership couldn't be proved, pregnant women are pretty sure their kid is theirs
[1:32:59] <Clawsze> Judaism is X-Chromosome recessive

[1:35:01] <nickjura> you need to be buried son god can bring you back to life when earth becomes paradise
[1:35:03] <%Pappajimbo> the valley of the dead
[1:35:04] <Pt_Kamen> There's no jew heaven, just stay nonconcious on the dirt
[1:35:06] <$lotharrio> No cremation. Keep your organs.
[1:35:09] <+SommenRider> it's called "Sheol"
[1:35:10] <neraren> Saint Peter outside Jewish heaven is like the security guard at the parking garage for google saying he works at google
[1:35:11] <%RealThiele> sentient ashes
[1:35:12] <%stantheman_97> afterlife isn't a big focus in Judaism, from what I understand
[1:35:12] <teh_Question> they also get buried standing up
[1:35:13] <+SommenRider> it just means after
[1:35:14] <+twohitgood> no cremation and NO TATTOOS
[1:35:15] <%deadbeat34> afterlife in intentionally vague
[1:35:15] <blackbaron98> The rapture?
[1:35:16] <+trackles_64> so no paige?
[1:35:16] <%ElectricEmissary> yeah Judaism doesn't got no hell, it's just deliberately ambiguous
[1:35:18] <%ClericOfSparda> It's some weird shit. You hang out until Armageddon and then come back for the final battle as a cheerleader, then you end how it ends
[1:35:18] <+SommenRider> everyone goes to it

[1:35:23] <+dylin456> Hey will you or paige do a snowgrave run of deltarune
[1:35:23] <%RigmaroleHM> He's gotta work his 9-5
[1:35:23] <Pt_Kamen> but mormons and converting the dead
[1:35:28] <%ThomasOfTroy> Historically, Judaism doesn't have an afterlife
[1:35:29] <+twohitgood> if you have tattoos, you're not included.
[1:35:30] <%Ipsenscastle> What if your grave gets obliterated by an asteroid
[1:35:30] <%justcallmebobplease> So St. Peter's got a defunct job?
[1:35:30] <NorthGrizzly> It is why Jewish does not allow Tatoos

[1:35:34] <+SommenRider> sheol is just where you go and its nature is unclear

[2:12:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt New DBD update - Spirit nerfed Trapper buffed and third seal now works on all attacks
[2:12:54] <jorniev> I JUST JOINED BECAUSE BAYO 3
[2:13:00] <jorniev> I DINT KNOW
[2:13:06] <nickjura> WOULD YOU PLAY DIABLO 2 PAT?
[2:13:07] <jorniev> IM LOSING MY MIND

[2:13:40] <teefpal> Bayos new hairstyle is great
[2:13:49] <+Pinkiefan> What’s the nerf for Spirit?
[2:13:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pig items to be buffed
[2:13:57] <+Das_Prints> Buffed a few survivor perks too.
[2:13:57] <RyuuAoi> @teefpal FUCK YEAH.
[2:14:01] <billcozbi> ah I'm just in time
[2:14:02] <@tizz86> hic
[2:14:03] <%amaranthos> Nice sound
[2:14:07] <thelonechris> The fuck
[2:14:08] <nickjura> dolphine
[2:14:09] <NireFuster> Oh good I'm not the only one that gets hiccups like that
[2:14:10] <%SinnerEbru> pat wtf was that noise??
[2:14:18] <OneThousandTomatoes> oh yeah
[2:14:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Spirit kicks up dust while phasing and makes a noise if your in her terror radius
[2:14:21] <nickjura> dolphine hic
[2:14:23] <NireFuster> I thought there was something wrong with me
[2:14:28] <@tizz86> big Ame energy on that one
[2:14:41] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt also theres hard locks on the school story stuff that require story progress, but either way i'll keep an eye out for any standout side cases, the one you left off on last night is S+ for example
[2:14:43] <%captain_thickthighs> dude I there was a retro game shop that was charging over $200 for Chrono trigger on the DS
[2:14:59] <%Garthunox> @tizz86 big smol ame
[2:15:06] <+FutaSnek> That's like a constantne plotline
[2:15:08] <RyuuAoi> @captain_thickthighs Fucking pirates
[2:15:17] <@QueequegTheater> Constantine basically does that
[2:15:18] <+NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt did you ever watch legends of the guild
[2:15:19] <@tizz86> @garthunox o7 teammate
[2:15:19] <@Ranryu692> we only just finished the last crusade like a month and a half ago
[2:15:20] <OneThousandTomatoes> pretty sure an auction house owner baught a game at a price high enough to make headlines from themselves
[2:15:21] <pajamerslammer> I remember in Netflix Castlevania they had priests bless an entire moat around a town to protect it from Vampires
[2:15:21] <%Ynkubus_> did you not see the water pistol baptism or was that just me?
[2:15:27] <jorniev> was bayo 3 the only news ?
[2:15:29] <%Faustgesicht> Any Survivor within 24m of The Spirit will now hear a directional phase sound. Spirit footsteps kick up dust while invisible; tall grass can block it
[2:15:32] <jorniev> something else?
[2:15:39] <%Monkeyweed21> the conversion only really matters if the Catholic Church has tons of power in that community or time period
[2:15:56] <@QueequegTheater> Pig buffs never FeelsBadMan
[2:16:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its a patch
[2:16:11] <%lumporr> is there a new smash man yet
[2:16:13] <%lumporr> did i miss it
[2:16:16] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Phase sounds are now directional
[2:16:16] <@tizz86> @garthunox more of a takodachi/shrimp but love all Myth
[2:16:22] <pajamerslammer> Bayo 2 on Wii U looked how it probably would have on any console. Bayo 3 looks to have been very deliberately designed around Switch hardware
[2:16:36] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Phase sounds are now directional and Spirit now kicks up dirt while invisible
[2:16:40] <+FutaSnek> @lumporr Oct 05 there will be an announcment

[2:59:51] <BackflipCharm> This is all part of intimidation strats too. Show them how good you are with a bat
[2:59:58] <keatiestofthegribbles> i miss the expos
[3:00:04] <%arizenarkana> RGG games become 10x more fun when you imagine EVERYTHING is canon, including the minigames.
[3:00:05] <fIashman92> The pitches are preset
[3:00:09] <$lotharrio> The crime is the lack of DINGERS
[3:00:11] <RyuuAoi> This is PLOT
[3:00:19] <vonmaultke> Yea i just memorise it
[3:00:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> isn't that just memorization then
[3:00:19] <%amaranthos> Worn out rubber
[3:00:23] <%amaranthos> excuse me?
[3:00:26] <BoneofMalkav> Best Smile :)
[3:00:26] <thelonechris> Ew, a worn-out rubber
[3:00:29] <KingSwansJamboree> yeah thats how i cheesed it
[3:00:36] <%notsoy> they kinda are, considering how many substories reference previous substories
[3:00:37] <+twohitgood> @RyuuAoi deepest plot
[3:00:38] <%edibleskeleton> pat wishes he could be a baseball one day
[3:00:41] <%TheAdMerlin> Is that a claw machine for Calorie mate?
[3:00:51] <Zeif00> Yeah Purikura
[3:01:07] <%Mr_Pylon> pocket racers is cannon
[3:01:10] <$lotharrio> Did you give yourself cat ears, Pat?
[3:01:12] <thelonechris> Kiryu really did hire a chicken
[3:01:17] <DSD24> Like the micromachines bit in Zero?
[3:01:21] <Krisaeron> All Yakuza is Canon, yes
[3:01:26] <%edibleskeleton> Kiryu canonically says trans rights psaUp
[3:01:26] <%tigerfang86> that was CANON
[3:01:31] <Brandon__Brando> LUL
[3:01:31] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:01:33] <brunoberserk> this game is 2 years after yakuza 7 , right ? wtf ichiban and his friends  are doing ?
[3:01:34] <%notsoy> for example, characters in 0 reappear in both k1 and k2
[3:01:38] <$lotharrio> It IS canon.
[3:01:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> speaking of which, is pocket racer in this?
[3:01:38] <+CherteuseKapibara> hey man Mini 4wd are sick
[3:01:40] <RyuuAoi> Grind, Pat!
[3:01:40] <%tigerfang86> remember when Kiryu became the MASCOT ONO-MICHIO
[3:01:40] <@ssjklyco> Multiple days in one evening
[3:01:45] <%tigerfang86> cause THAT'S CANON TOO
[3:01:51] <$KaosMachina> could be post-game Platinum Adventure is the canon version of events.
[3:01:54] <%Ipsenscastle> Kiryu canonically wrote 'B O O B I E S' to that camgirl
[3:01:54] <Krisaeron> CRIME
[3:01:56] <Shirousuke1989> Wait you go to Yokohama in Lost Judgement!?
[3:01:56] <xbb1024> completionist is cannon
[3:01:59] <Shirousuke1989> Dang
[3:02:00] <%KaiserMario> Pocket Racer is Pat's favorite mini-game, right?
[3:02:00] <KingSwansJamboree> @brunoberserk dude rocking
[3:02:02] <$lotharrio> That racer dude is canon.
[3:02:02] <roobanguy> or when kazuya literally became a multi billionaire over the course of a day
[3:02:04] <JunkyardCrow> Or there is just continuity between the omake 🤔
[3:02:06] <+KUYAmoPESh> Is Yakuza7 in the same timeline as Lost Judgement?
[3:02:09] <Krisaeron> Time for Parkour!
[3:02:10] <%TheAdMerlin> Does that include the buisness dimension?
[3:02:28] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt Suzi just came up with a galaxy brain theory about the Bayo voice acting thing
[3:02:32] <BigFingerRo> @tigerfang86 which one is it, the one with a hassaku head?
[3:02:48] <smoothwood07> tape a carpet over the cables
[3:02:49] <BigFingerRo> and onomichi ramen hat?
[3:02:49] <%JoshManVGH> Cereza!
[3:02:50] <JunkyardCrow> Venom Bayo
[3:02:52] <%RealThiele> 2x bayos
[3:02:54] <%SveriSageAdvice> its that she's Alternate Cereza
[3:02:54] <%Tman451> Costanza?
[3:02:58] <+JustToWatch> multiple bayonetta's
[3:03:00] <DSD24> Its Cereza cause her hair is similar
[3:03:00] <LordOfThePoultry> yeyeye
[3:03:03] <%polothegreatest> or V plot
[3:03:04] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt its that its takes place before 1 and 2
[3:03:05] <%tigerfang86> Punished Bayo
[3:03:05] <BoneofMalkav> Punished Bayo
[3:03:06] <ExpressNode> Can't you get one of those cable liner things for the ground?
[3:03:07] <+pectusumbra> punished Bayo
[3:03:08] <$lotharrio> Detective mode.
[3:03:08] <BigFingerRo> trendy and bold shirt?
[3:03:10] <%blankwaffle> can you trick off that mound thing?
[3:03:11] <%JoshManVGH> Time Lost Cereza
[3:03:13] <%greasypete00> I was wondering if it was like a younger bayo or something because she looks like bayo but slightly different
[3:03:14] <%juxtest> Mayonetta
[3:03:16] <+MauriceFaurron> punished bayo
[3:03:17] <extradopeness> no voice acting news can be more distressing than crisp rat
[3:03:19] <BigFingerRo> boots essential to every fisherman?
[3:03:21] <MisoScoots> aint cereza get her ass beat in the teaser?
[3:03:24] <+TheBitingIrish> They super got me with the Astral Chain Jebaited
[3:03:24] <+Kyma1020> Either alt timeline Cereza or Bayo split in two and we're playing the Cereza half
[3:03:27] <+CherteuseKapibara> its actually astral chain
[3:03:27] <+KUYAmoPESh> Are we going to meet some secret Koreans?
[3:03:31] <$KaosMachina> "The last Lumen and Umbran have been dead for millenia, these are their descendants"
[3:03:35] <ErikFeral> Yakuza has ghosts, aliens and busniess dimensions
[3:03:43] <@ssjklyco> Bayo has a lot of time travel, so this could just be Bayo: Enter the Multiverse
[3:03:45] <%tigerfang86> a beehive AND ammunition
[3:03:50] <$lotharrio> It's Jeanne pretending to be Bayo, making fun of her.
[3:03:51] <%captain_thickthighs> that's a decent theory might have explain new hair style
[3:03:56] <vonmaultke> Isn't this Secret Korean territory?
[3:04:01] <%tigerfang86> trapped in buisiness zone
[3:04:06] <Krisaeron> Park - Our
[3:04:07] <%SilvaChariot0133> HARDCOOOORE
[3:04:08] <RyuuAoi> And who was dude at the end of Bayo trailer with katana?!
[3:04:13] <%stickislaw> Gotta learn how to wall run so you can beat up even more kids
[3:04:13] <%edibleskeleton> GHOSTS ARE CANON
[3:04:14] <%RealThiele> PARKOUR
[3:04:17] <Krisaeron> Poggers Pat!
[3:04:20] <%arcadianskypirate> hardcore parkour
[3:04:20] <$KaosMachina> PRINCE OF PERSONA TECH
[3:04:20] <TheotherKristian> I'm gonna make an ARMCHAIR THEORY, accompanied with no evidence or further thought!: They probably couldn't fly Helena Taylor to Japan due to covid flight restrictions.
[3:04:21] <thelonechris> And there's just an earthworm
[3:04:21] <%blankwaffle> prince of Persia?
[3:04:22] <$KaosMachina> OR WHATEVER
[3:04:23] <%notsoy> ERI is a demonstration why optional party members don't totally work
[3:04:24] <LoneFonte> possibly alt Jeanne
[3:04:24] <KingSwansJamboree> i love psychonauts 2
[3:04:32] <Ardailec> Man I thought this area just had a fire, this looks like a warzone
[3:04:34] <+BlackStarAura> Delicious earthworm
[3:04:35] <Ner234> Is wall running like that actually possible?
[3:04:38] <+Raven_In_A_Tree> I hate the new bayo design personally. but i think it's a prequel like DMC3 so she's younger cereza not bayo, also why they add totally not vergil
[3:04:39] <+TheBitingIrish> And Yagami takes Silver!
[3:04:40] <%Ynkubus_> @RyuuAoi i'd be surprised if its not just Jeanne but more Vergil
[3:04:45] <xbb1024> I mean, it's a better dimension then the one where there are roaming fights on the streets everywhere
[3:04:47] <Zeif00> -
[3:04:48] <BoneofMalkav> "If you know how to wall run, You can dodge a ball!" LUL
[3:04:55] <%polothegreatest> a shame astral chain almost never on sale
[3:05:01] <AMajorTom> He didn’t yell Parcour!
[3:05:02] <%captain_thickthighs> what is the sword guy was just a young Virgil?
[3:05:04] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Do you think for the next "Judgement" type game they'll create a new char, instead of using a real person again?
[3:05:05] <+twohitgood> @TheotherKristian voice actors can normally just record in home studios for most gigs.
[3:05:13] <Teras_ode> must consoom
[3:05:14] <+KaguraRaion> God all that bird shit
[3:05:15] <SuperFightinRobot> Cause he fat

[3:05:29] <AwesomeInABox> idk about touching mysterious fruit thats growing on moldy pipes outside
[3:05:38] <RyuuAoi> @ynkubus_ Those soldiers could see what ever the fuck those monsters were so something is UP.
[3:05:38] <%tigerfang86> nice DUNGEON
[3:05:45] <%Xevtes> @AwesomeInABox thats paige's job
[3:05:51] <%arizenarkana> I just remembered that a main story quest in Yakuza 7 segways directly into the Eri sidequest line so the business chickens are super canon.
[3:05:56] <thelonechris> Uh oh

[3:06:47] <$KaosMachina> and they team up with Demifiend
[3:06:49] <MarvelousMrD> Is yagami like, a tougher fighter than ichiban?
[3:06:49] <%arcadianskypirate> that arrow is a red herring
[3:06:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Just treat Yagami like the Warriors of Light in 2.0
[3:06:50] <%Ynkubus_> @RyuuAoi that'll be cool to find out whats up about that
[3:06:54] <Krisaeron> Give up Pat! Its impossible!

[3:15:22] <RyuuAoi> Let him run in the backyard.
[3:15:32] <%juxtest> Take him for a walk in the Ham Pits
[3:15:35] <+ekodrop> we talking about uncooked pasta? and not just cooked unflavored pasta...

[3:16:23] <%Mr_Pylon> Do you have anything they can use
[3:16:25] <+Delenay> he wants something he doesnt know
[3:16:25] <+JustToWatch> info that they don't have
[3:16:26] <+MrMcCrabby> you have to tell him something he doesn't know
[3:16:47] <tanarath> Pat's 100% right, you have to actually give companions real care & interesting trips or they cause mischief.
[3:17:20] <%polothegreatest> salary cutting noises

[3:20:02] <%GuilKato> that cop is too powerful
[3:20:05] <@Spydurman> why does everyone pretend the arrest is an alibi? Didn't he get arrested 2 months after the guy died??
[3:20:06] <ghosrevan> it's almsot like its a dirty plot
[3:20:09] <%chiazam> OKAY, But why tell people he knew where Mikoshiba's body is, WHAT DOES HE GAIN
[3:20:35] <@Spydurman> ohhhhhh
[3:20:37] <%chiazam> @Spydurman it was the same day apparently
[3:20:43] <+MauriceFaurron> i mean it's a pretty convulted plan to get an alibi
[3:20:46] <%twoto858> The body went undiscovered for 2 months
[3:20:50] <Admiral_PopnFresh> its kinda fun imagining that everytime someone dies in the Yakuza world, a murder investigation game is happening concurrently to the main Yakuza plot
[3:20:54] <@Spydurman> ok that'd been confusing me for ages
[3:20:56] <%captain_thickthighs> yeah in Japan they can hold you indefinitely if they wanted before your trial there's no limit
[3:20:57] <+kewlmyc> Is he eating dry spaghetti noodles?
[3:21:18] <ghosrevan> what
[3:21:27] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @kewlmyc i have a close friend who does that as a tic
[3:21:32] <RyuuAoi> That's fucked. His court date need to be the next day or if it's the weekend, on Monday.
[3:22:12] <+KaguraRaion> Get slutted
[3:22:18] <OneThousandTomatoes> he got slut
[3:22:19] <studleydoorite> he was mansluttered
[3:22:20] <%GuilKato> the decomp alone should give you a good time frame of how long the body was rotting though?
[3:22:31] <%justcallmebobplease> Left handed fingerprints, got it!
[3:22:39] <%captain_thickthighs> Japan has a 99 conviction rate so nooo way innconcent people get jailed or forced to admit...
[3:22:45] <@ssjklyco> If the guy was gonna get away with murder, why even bother telling the court there is a body?
[3:22:49] <%Monkeyweed21> @RyuuAoi thats the tip of the bullshit iceberg, just wait until you learn about pre-written confessions the police try to make you sign
[3:22:57] <%LeiaSkynoober> Yo
[3:23:00] <Admiral_PopnFresh> maybe a killer had a change of heart?

[3:24:02] <%captain_thickthighs> or Ehara would be safe in jail

[3:36:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> considering that he made a program that monitors the city through social media this is kinda weird
[3:36:06] <%captain_thickthighs> trusting an otaku to place cameras dang voice to type
[3:36:24] <%captain_thickthighs> I think China already has that
[3:36:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> also the bathroom camera
[3:37:06] <%castlerock42> Pat, your team seems extemely incompetent.
[3:37:06] <Oxybe> Tsukumo, stop acting like the creepo depot and maybe you won't be grabbed by every cop

[3:37:29] <%laserbeaming> It only detects Suspicious Signals, it ignores Legit signals. Somehow
[3:37:48] <%chiazam> Wow this game still has tutorial prompts huh
[3:37:52] <OneThousandTomatoes> how do they know if the badge is fake or not?
[3:38:03] <%hat_under_bread> @captain_thickthighs It ignores legit ones because video games.
