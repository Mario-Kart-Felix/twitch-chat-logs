[0:05:34] <%umbranviking> psaGiefstare
[0:06:24] <DensityD> I bet it will be a gritty side story of survival and hunting without a good smithy to back a lone hunter up
[0:06:41] <DensityD> (don't tell me otherwise, I want to dream)
[0:06:44] <%umbranviking> I'm conflicted cause all my friends are playin rise on PC, but I have it on switch, and if I can get my BF to play with me I'd need another switch copy... dont really wanna triple dip cause I ain't made of money

[0:19:49] <%dadudewitdadragontattoo> Beware of But holes
[0:19:52] <+charp35> Hopefully they can patch it out by the time Elden Ring comes out
[0:19:52] <%Bailey__Gaming> Oh
[0:19:53] <Profmcstevie> Now that makes me hollow
[0:19:54] <%GinAndRoses> consider my head up
[0:19:54] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Good thing i had no plans to play any of them

[0:19:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE ULTIMATE DARK SOULS FINAL BOSS.......HACKERS
[0:19:56] <%VashyronM> that sucks
[0:19:56] <%XelanArdel> fan patch was released recently with blue sentinel i heard
[0:19:58] <%cartakus> That is a big no no
[0:19:58] <%IamGrapes> oh lawdy
[0:19:59] <sirtommygunn> yeah extremely fucked
[0:20:00] <%InternetShis> New World 2
[0:20:01] <+gatdragon> Hackers NotLikeThis
[0:20:02] <+Caidezes> I'm playing Elden Ring solo anyway.
[0:20:04] <%CalderGaming> psaOrb Hunter
[0:20:07] <randomlyalwaystired> Just PC right? Consoles not affected?
[0:20:07] <sheepymcsheeperton> but that just ups the risk of being invaded Kappa
[0:20:09] <%dadudewitdadragontattoo> Be wary of but hole
[0:20:10] <%KeiganOfAstora> Just curious, not saying I know it's better
[0:20:10] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Only a bit harder
[0:20:11] <DensityD> Kreygasm it's hard Kreygasm
[0:20:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> There's less they can do with that
[0:20:14] <+resogami> That sounds like some shit they're gonna race to patch out before Elden Ring releases
[0:20:15] <%cartakus> Oh shit
[0:20:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> Okay gotcha
[0:20:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> Unless you do your banking on your PS5
[0:20:25] <mike2hands> damm you phone, im late
[0:20:27] <CollinsOfBodom> so fuck online for now, got it
[0:20:30] <%umbranviking> all for bitcoin goddamnit
[0:20:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> Hopefully they mention something about patches for Elden Ring
[0:20:34] <%ChrisPlaysThing> considerign what I know of playstation shit
[0:20:34] <randomlyalwaystired> Oh damn.
[0:20:36] <$joylent_blue> just don't have card info saved on your ps5 i guess
[0:20:37] <+Peacefrog7> @patstaresat so this is just for all online players even if we don't connect to these players?
[0:20:38] <%vehementvadr> nothing is impossible with the power of play
[0:20:46] <%Dakuu75> are you still vulnerable if you play without invasions~?
[0:20:51] <%TheHateFish> If it's the Log4j exploit, it's possible to set up Windows Firewall to block the relevant stuff so people can't get in. It'd be a goddamned nightmare, and probably kill your connectivity anyway, but it'd be doable.
[0:20:51] <%SaiyanShoto> Just don’t play online on DS3 in general then?
[0:20:51] <%cartakus> Well rip co-op covenant uf there is one
[0:20:52] <@Ranryu692> delay incoming
[0:20:56] <SamuraiEdgeplay> where's my sweet Elden Ring delay, Bandai?
[0:20:58] <%dekkitout> @ReallyBigRocks I'm getting tired of this PS5 injoke thing. What is a PS5?
[0:21:01] <%Dakuu75> -at all? damn, ok.
[0:21:01] <Mattais88> I never give sony my card info. Gift cards every time
[0:21:02] <+RedKazoo> We're DELAYING Elden Ring another 6 months guys LUL
[0:21:03] <+Peacefrog7> fuck
[0:21:09] <%KeiganOfAstora> You're connected to the servers, period.
[0:21:15] <alaskanbullwurm> apparently the DS3 blue sentinel watch released a patch already
[0:21:17] <sirtommygunn> Thought they had to invade you, damn
[0:21:17] <%Bailey__Gaming> did pat shave his eyebrows?
[0:21:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> @dekkitout vibo gam
[0:21:19] <%dadudewitdadragontattoo> That’s not cool
[0:21:24] <%umbranviking> @saiyanshoto for the time being
[0:21:24] <%dadudewitdadragontattoo> Totally unfair
[0:21:25] <%GinAndRoses> unplug the damn cable
[0:21:27] <%ChrisPlaysThing> It probably HAS gone gold! But right now should be where they are doing Cert/QA on the DAY 1 Patch
[0:21:28] <Tracazoid> I feel like it has been an issue for a while, last time I wanted to play Dark Souls 3 a few months back and heard it was hacker city
[0:21:40] <SilverFaustX> chat a headsup, do NOT go online in dark souls 3 invaders can hack your pc

[0:38:44] <Estwilde> They should use it, because it's very good
[0:38:44] <Mattais88> I do!
[0:38:45] <GMKGoat> There's a lot more HH users in Rise
[0:38:46] <+KngJester> hunting horn best weapon

[0:38:54] <ohno58> time for dick dragon
[0:38:54] <%barrakuta371> new Hunting Horn is cool though
[0:38:58] <%GinAndRoses> tons more people as of this game tho
[0:39:01] <Estwilde> Folks that don't use Hunting Horn are really doing themselves a disservice
[0:39:03] <%FacetiousAF> earplugs are real big good
[0:39:07] <%GinAndRoses> HH got such a glow up
[0:39:12] <+Pachi3000> y load so long

[0:39:16] <%baka_sugoi> JAM OUT
[0:39:16] <%cartakus> But music
[0:39:18] <%FacetiousAF> but also it bonk
[0:39:18] <+TestAnon> I played Hunting Horn before it was cool
[0:39:22] <Profmcstevie> Earplugs? I think you mean "I will simply block/counter the roar"
[0:39:22] <%patriotrenegade> patriotrenegade subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 43 months, currently on a 43 month streak! 
[0:39:24] <+Mrbaconator> i loved HH in world and it's even better in rise
[0:39:25] <%GinAndRoses> very baller weapon
[0:39:29] <owensleftfoot> @octotasty It's just 90% AOE's, it's just not fun at all
[0:39:43] <%FacetiousAF> must be the rollback netcode
[0:39:44] <DensityD> the thing about HH that i miss is the multiple songs for each horn, now it's less. I respect Plague's work to study each sound
[0:39:48] <Coystick> Huge crash
[0:39:48] <%patriotrenegade> It’s not as cool as hammer.
[0:39:49] <%valriot> Its loading all of Khezus foreskin

[0:40:12] <Dova573> lol never seen that even in the switch
[0:40:12] <%patriotrenegade> I bet it’s Eli’s fault.

[0:40:24] <MillaMoks> @PocketBearIllustrator Quite fun, especially the new buzz saw mode
[0:40:24] <+Pachi3000> Even Switch this would be too long
[0:40:24] <%cade_calrayn> yeah it's probably Eli's internet
[0:40:28] <%Brassnarwhal> Brassnarwhal subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Had to pause Woolie's latest dark souls video to get into this stream but it's so worth it, so happy to see a fellow hunting horn main out here dooting the big horn, love the streams Pat

[0:55:54] <SlimeSlimeSlime> He coomin!
[0:55:59] <+Heart0fInk> Use gun to fight penis
[0:56:01] <sirtommygunn> Peach's turn to jump in while he is pulsing with electricity
[0:56:07] <artificiallynatural> fought him in high rank today and he did that like 5 times in a row
[0:56:13] <rayning_> Pat don’t forget the S Axe has a fade slash for the sword mode
[0:56:17] <+Heart0fInk> I'm glad they kept the penis monsters classic music.
[0:56:18] <Radioactivetaco9> Insect glaive gets it for free
[0:56:20] <Coystick> Mass Produced Eva looking asshole
[0:56:33] <Aussie_Manny> Oh no, he can't hear me! He's got earplugs in!
[0:56:33] <sirtommygunn> its a very good skill
[0:56:35] <KellBeII> paige feeling better?
[0:56:35] <%patriotrenegade> If this was Dark Souls the water would be conducting the electricity
[0:56:38] <owensleftfoot> Tbf in rise it's not nearly as useful since most weapons have some way of negating roars
[0:56:38] <Profmcstevie> I simply block the roar and laugh
[0:56:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> I hate his little fingernails

[0:57:20] <+Shoosler> lol Paige's character sounds a lot like her
[0:57:21] <kazadog> so what weapon does plague play?
[0:57:24] <fairore> @mattais88 nice
[0:57:25] <Aussie_Manny> gross
[0:57:32] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> Khezu also have booba
[0:57:33] <%GinAndRoses> premature?
[0:57:34] <Jetsfantasy> Blood in the dishcarge
[0:57:38] <GudoXIII> so if I'm not mistaken, the game didnt fix that thing where the music disappears when you fight Khezu
[0:57:38] <owensleftfoot> I call Red Khezu the Red Rocket
[0:57:43] <bippityjones> The Khezu theme music is always so intense
[0:57:44] <%ChrisPlaysThing> It was supposed to be filling, instead it was a Glaze Kappa
[0:57:48] <%octotasty> is Pat letting Paige handle stuff or is he just bad at Switch Axe?
[0:57:52] <drawie_holly> khezy does Not Have booba
[0:57:54] <+yuribo26> Pat became a pirate for a second
[0:57:58] <Aussie_Manny> AROOOOO
[0:57:58] <IIVELIISCHPFULII> khezu denied your discharge
[0:57:59] <kazadog> khezu looks like a raw turkey in the freezer section
[0:58:00] <%FunkyStreams> oh its back
[0:58:03] <GMKGoat> Maybe a little of both

[0:58:17] <+JupiterDjin> He finished his Refractory period
[0:58:17] <+rbakervv> @GudoXIII it's not a bug, music kicks in when the monster sees you, Khezu is blind
[0:58:19] <Ardailec> It's throbbing with rage D:
[0:58:20] <%BinaryFireball> is that a dicken? the dick chicken?
[0:58:21] <owensleftfoot> @GudoXIII It's intentional, since music only plays when a monster spots you, which khezu can't do since it's blind

[0:59:10] <Shardlab> It's just the tip....
[0:59:16] <GudoXIII> @owensleftfoot @rbakervv I mean, I get it, but its still odd that you fight him in dead silence
[0:59:19] <Aussie_Manny> DIE, WING!
[0:59:19] <sirtommygunn> Is Peach's hammer nice and sharp, she's bouncing off the wings
[0:59:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> who knows

[0:59:51] <%blastyoboots> I love how Pat lets Peach take the credit for breaking it when it was the instant his Zero Sum Discharge went off
[0:59:52] <+rbakervv> @GudoXIII it just adds to the creep factor of this monster
[0:59:54] <%JustToWatch> still never quite got why you need to sharpen a hammer

[1:01:04] <Darthkitten_Prime> Switch axe is so good though
[1:01:05] <%Agami23> pat seems to have a weird tendency of not healing
[1:01:05] <tacotaskforce> does the game have auto-translate phrases?
[1:01:07] <%vehementvadr> DUNG
[1:01:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @chrisplaysthing Mine is: Have you actually tried getting good?

[1:01:56] <Minorou> Khezu, then Cooler Khezu
[1:02:02] <%blastyoboots> oh god the head is busted!

[1:02:11] <Jetsfantasy> The penis is tired
[1:02:14] <Shardlab> A khezu with poison and eggs. Ana parasites babies... It WAS gross
[1:02:14] <mike2hands> giginox armor was better too
[1:02:19] <tacotaskforce> Darn, too bad you don't get auto-translate options. Guess it's not worth putting custom stuff in there then
[1:02:22] <SlimeSlimeSlime> He's going limp!
[1:02:27] <Aussie_Manny> Get back here, coward!
[1:02:28] <+lewd_sister_of_battle> always thought gigginox was the grosser of the two

[1:02:39] <%tank7013> Khezy will always hold a special place as my first wall in monster hunter. That one in freedom unite kicked my ass

[1:18:11] <Aussie_Manny> They BOTH fell?! D:
[1:18:13] <Ipsenscastle> @Xfire_exe it's definitely much easier than the previous ones, but i'm fine with that
[1:18:25] <Zombrocom> Shoot some LASERS
[1:18:25] <Aussie_Manny> Pat, solo this muddy bitch.
[1:18:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> fun fact: if you took a bunch of ants and lined them up end to end until they reached the sun, most of them would probably die
[1:18:28] <%TrafficCohen> Basarios sucks
[1:18:30] <%dekkitout> @grand_nelson From the launcher with shield bash yeah

[1:19:08] <Aussie_Manny> PogChamp doodBeamL doodBeam doodBeam
[1:19:10] <Saltmeisterr> that reminds me
[1:19:11] <DaKnightWarrior> Hope Gravios makes it into sunbreak
[1:19:16] <Zombrocom> @tank7013 I think odds are pretty good
[1:19:16] <rasamune> God I hope we get to fight Zamtrios again
[1:19:17] <%TrafficCohen> >Non Oils based SnS
[1:19:24] <%Puhff> oh COME ON MH

[1:19:44] <%king_wragles> It 200% is
[1:19:44] <%notsoy> it definitely is
[1:19:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It is pretty weird that Zamtrios isn't in, considering Zamites are
[1:19:46] <@Ranryu692> if it's still moving it is
[1:19:47] <Coystick> Because we're all monsters inside
[1:19:48] <Aussie_Manny> YES IT IS
[1:19:48] <owensleftfoot> @tank7013 Zam should come back, Gravious can rot in hell
[1:19:49] <tigerfang86> YES it IS

[1:20:25] <sheepymcsheeperton> Nice pat
[1:20:28] <%tank7013> @owensleftfoot I don't disagree LUL . Still weird to see Basarios without it though
[1:20:29] <%MidnightBurst12> oh no, she's crazy
[1:20:30] <+TheBitingIrish> A skeleton without it's flesh-mech is 100% a monster
[1:20:30] <Coystick> GLASSES
[1:20:30] <+bassforte123> Skeletons are Zombies on a diet
[1:20:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> skeletons are like the most classic monsters ever
[1:20:31] <%barrakuta371> Skele momsties
[1:20:32] <zzNamttamzz> Real skeletons aren't monsters
[1:20:33] <%notsoy> she can't read, the map won't help
[1:20:35] <%RoninRorinth> RoninRorinth subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 60 months, currently on a 60 month streak! good to see paige still in denial
[1:20:37] <%TerpanderLux> theyre the funny arrow
[1:20:38] <Erodeas> what are zombies and other undead creatures then?
[1:20:38] <%Monkeyweed21> just wait until Paige sees the skeleton monster
[1:20:42] <Zeif00> Kappa
[1:20:43] <DensityD> Pat's fighting style is oldschool and seems strange to me
[1:20:45] <%TrafficCohen> I guess this is Low Rank?
[1:20:48] <vonmaultke> a living skeleton is a monster, it appears at holloween
[1:20:50] <fairore> @valentinius_anodyne hes probably coming in sunbreak
[1:20:54] <DensityD> I'm not even a power gaming hunter...
[1:20:55] <+other_badger> humans are the real monsters, but only becuase they have skeletons inside
[1:20:56] <thebreadlord20> THERES A SKELETON INSIDE YOU RIGHT NOW.
[1:20:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> I love democracy
[1:20:57] <Zombrocom> Shame radobaan isn't in this game
[1:21:01] <+gatdragon> I love democracy
[1:21:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @chrisplaysthing I more like Woolie:  We dont kink shame.....EXCEPT WHEN WE DO
[1:21:03] <+Sirius_6> @TrafficCohen Yeah, 2* Hub
[1:21:03] <+gatdragon> LUL
[1:21:07] <%Puhff> Yeah Undertale doesn't count cuz it's bad and the characters are stupid Keepo
[1:21:07] <%blastyoboots> shoulda used that switch axe
[1:21:08] <@SoFarFetched> that mean's we're all monsters inside
[1:21:08] <Zombrocom> Pat needs the leaping switch skill for SNS
[1:21:12] <%TheDullaMAN> Try Sun and Moon, instead.
[1:21:12] <Profmcstevie> Then hit the feet and knock it over
[1:21:15] <TheQuadrupleS> She was fantasizing about Skeletons LUL
[1:21:19] <%TrafficCohen> Thanks
[1:21:22] <super_ej8> Great Sword SUPREMACY!
[1:21:24] <+SilverDevilfish> Oh god Pat is using the sword part
[1:21:26] <%TheDullaMAN> We are the monsters on the inside.
[1:21:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O the real monster was MAN ALL ALONG
[1:21:29] <%Axellogic> @Sirius_6 Bow has healing arrows Eli
[1:21:30] <@Spydurman> there's a monster in everyone and it's a skelly ton
[1:21:31] <sirtommygunn> Yeah, PAIGE is the one who needs better gear
[1:21:38] <%Axellogic> why did that do a reply
[1:21:40] <Shadowanroid> Orb
[1:21:42] <sirtommygunn> not the guy who carted twice
[1:21:42] <%TrafficCohen> Pat just sharpen on your doggo
[1:21:44] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @BallerSwagBro9k "Adult Baby men? THE FUCK WE DON'T!"
[1:21:46] <vonmaultke> Bow is OP
[1:21:46] <MillaMoks> @PatStaresAt IF you want to hit the tail with SnS reliably, use the wirebind skill that has you swinging the sword all around you while it is attached to the string. ITs great for tailing and part breaking
[1:21:46] <%TrafficCohen> SWAXE RULES
[1:21:53] <vonmaultke> better to avoid it
[1:21:54] <DensityD> fantastic 8 jumping slash
[1:21:59] <%TerpanderLux> Swax.
[1:22:00] <+Mrbaconator> SWAXE MY WETS
[1:22:01] <GMKGoat> It is the swaxe
[1:22:03] <EASrake> it is swaxe
[1:22:03] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Swussy
[1:22:05] <%legendfather_of_giants> swaxe is the term tho
[1:22:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @fairore Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if the mature versions of monsters in Rise come in Sunbreak
[1:22:05] <+the22cstomp> swaxe
[1:22:06] <%king_wragles> Swackity Swaxe
[1:22:07] <spinbel> everyone calls it swaxe
[1:22:08] <%Monkeyweed21> SWUSSY
[1:22:08] <+macnmoe> swax
[1:22:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEY SWAX
[1:22:08] <%TrafficCohen> I will continue
[1:22:08] <owensleftfoot> That's literally what everyone calls it Pat
[1:22:08] <GMKGoat> Or Swagaxe
[1:22:09] <+yuribo26> Swax is just the abreviation, lol
[1:22:09] <%barrakuta371> swaxe
[1:22:09] <%Agami23> the switchaxe has certain switchskills that work good for khezu
[1:22:11] <%hairtoday> swussy

[1:22:16] <@Ranryu692> Swiggedy swiggedy swaxe
[1:22:17] <Darthkitten_Prime> @PatStaresAt You can change weapons at the tent if you need a different weapon.
[1:22:17] <Ipsenscastle> swussy then
[1:22:17] <thebreadlord20> its always been the swaxe
[1:22:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> hit em with the swussy
[1:22:18] <%tank7013> The term SwAxe has been around since 3 I think
[1:22:20] <+PunkZedB> swuss
[1:22:21] <%Axellogic> Swaxe is a very jank weapon
[1:22:21] <+TheBitingIrish> Swaxe is what people call it, fool
[1:22:24] <+marquezpsp> swag axe
[1:22:25] <%valriot> Pat the community decided on Swaxe for over a decade
[1:22:31] <%SaiyanShoto> That’s what it’s called though
[1:22:32] <thecrazyestminer> But it is swaxe
[1:22:33] <Aussie_Manny> Yes, skeletons are a type of monster. 💀
[1:22:34] <K1llingEdge> swaxe
[1:22:36] <%JoshManVGH> Glances are cooler
[1:22:43] <Saltmeisterr> mud is basically ground doodoo
[1:22:44] <sheepymcsheeperton> Use your switch skills to hit tail easier pat
[1:22:45] <Laecerelius> Don’t step in da poopoo
[1:22:45] <grand_nelson> its such a swaxy weapon
[1:22:49] <%Monkeyweed21> is your Swussy power or elemental type
[1:22:50] <JonnyJug> Are you enjoying Swonshi, Pat?
[1:22:53] <Treasure_Vault> gotta tar your handle
[1:22:55] <Coystick> They're called beaks
[1:22:58] <DensityD> oh it's a glance, I get it
[1:23:00] <%SodiumPatrol> gunlance is funlance
[1:23:05] <square__1> Skeletons are swaxey
[1:23:09] <Treasure_Vault> That's one of the coolest hammers
[1:23:10] <tacotaskforce> swaxe sounds like a music festival that costs $8,000 to get into, and lasts for 12 days
[1:23:11] <%JoshManVGH> Growrs are ok
[1:23:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> he runnin
[1:23:12] <sirtommygunn> yeah but they're hammers
[1:23:17] <+ArceusStarDestroyer> ArceusStarDestroyer subscribed with Prime. 
[1:23:17] <%tank7013> @Monkeyweed21 Impact
[1:23:18] <fairore> @valentinius_anodyne I'm still holding  out hope my bug bois come back in sunbreak
[1:23:19] <DensityD> Barrotthh just wants to Mud
[1:23:25] <zodiark26> back to the mud pit?
[1:23:29] <yukichocomilk> gotta sharpen my shield cause I blocked too much!
[1:23:30] <vonmaultke> Dunno why you don't tune your HH instead of sharpening
[1:23:37] <sirtommygunn> this barroth knows some maneuvers
[1:23:43] <%TerpanderLux> NOT THE MUD
[1:23:43] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "Who's talking"
[1:23:49] <DensityD> mudneuvers
[1:23:49] <TehMud> WHAT DO YOU WANT
[1:23:54] <+Sirius_6> @vonmaultke You sharpen the horn when the notes are flat Kappa
[1:23:59] <DensityD> Who's Hunt is it anyway?
[1:24:02] <+rdark_ksu> he needed a rejuvenating mud mask, dont we all
[1:24:08] <@Spydurman> LUL
[1:24:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> jump in that hole
[1:24:11] <Ipsenscastle> jeez
[1:24:11] <%Dakuu75> yeah, we seen you play Dark SOuls, you're good at falling off cliffs and into holes
[1:24:12] <%barrakuta371> psaGotcha psaLol
[1:24:14] <%YakumoYomi> Thank you, Eli
[1:24:20] <lethallylactic> OMEGALUL
[1:24:22] <owensleftfoot> Man Pat kinda sucks with SnS
[1:24:29] <Zeif00> LUL
[1:24:30] <%TrafficCohen> With the doggos and the bugs I never let the mons eat. I legit thought they took out the sleeping mechanic until I saw it at HR 60
[1:24:31] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "Thanks for dropping in Paige"
[1:24:33] <DensityD> He just remembered
[1:24:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Barroth needed to reapply his shoe polish
[1:24:40] <vonmaultke> Your joke was out of tune Kappa
[1:24:41] <Ipsenscastle> sick move
[1:24:42] <Waffle_Stache> plagueTaps plagueTaps plagueTaps
[1:24:48] <%YakumoYomi> Does Pat not have Shoryuken yet?
[1:24:49] <%GinAndRoses> oh right my MOVES
[1:24:58] <sirtommygunn> Take egg
[1:25:09] <winner_92> flipping around with the dual swords is so fun
[1:25:14] <Treasure_Vault> Monster Hunter has too many weapon styles to master in a reasonable timeframe
[1:25:15] <%TrafficCohen> Yeah but SnS gets you Akuma's fist weapons
[1:25:17] <Profmcstevie> I like to stab the monsters feet relentlessly like a pest
[1:25:17] <%brisk_dacat> Pat you ever tried lightbow gun
[1:25:19] <okkinraia> alright but SnS perfect rush is the shit though
[1:25:20] <Treasure_Vault> Pick one, maybe one and a half
[1:25:25] <yukichocomilk> sns is so fun
[1:25:29] <+Sirius_6> @YakumoYomi That's from the High Rank weapon quests, he's still in low rank
[1:25:30] <sheepymcsheeperton> SnS is great, the aerial switch skill is pretty good for catching tails
[1:25:36] <Cosairen> god i love the aerial addition to sns since world
[1:25:38] <%TheDullaMAN> Break his FAAAAAAAAAAACE
[1:25:44] <DensityD> good poll
[1:25:46] <vonmaultke> Big and slow preferably with a shield for me. Lane Glance and GS
[1:26:09] <%TheDullaMAN> 7 of you are wrong
[1:26:11] <fairore> @sheepymcsheeperton it is?
[1:26:19] <%YakumoYomi> @Sirius_6 Thank you.
[1:26:21] <%TrafficCohen> I used SA and Lance in Rise. Charge blade and Great Sword in World
[1:26:21] <Mattais88> hammer senpai
[1:26:23] <Ipsenscastle> i hate how barroth's charge sucks you in from behind it somehow
[1:26:32] <TehMud> Goddammit
[1:26:36] <DensityD> sonic bomb a barroth?
[1:26:45] <Make_me_mad> Lance is my favorite weapon in Rise. The wirebug gives you some much needed mobility, and that charging stab wirebug attack is incredible.
[1:26:45] <Cosairen> barroth is the hakan of monhun
[1:26:48] <%BinaryFireball> hit him his buttttt
[1:26:53] <%blistexthief> Hold on girl, I gotta mud it up
[1:26:55] <owensleftfoot> @Ipsenscastle That's been a problem in this series for years
[1:26:59] <Profmcstevie> His elemental weakness changing from mud to no mud makes it a chore to ever go for, raw damage all the way
[1:27:10] <+ParryLurr> wish i could play games with a girlfriend and a farmer
[1:27:20] <sirtommygunn> if you try the flashy move enough times you'll get it eventually
[1:27:23] <RedHotBoss> P P P stream
[1:27:23] <GMKGoat> same
[1:27:27] <%Axellogic> Use gun
[1:27:33] <+Vigonept> just be better pat ez
[1:27:34] <Estwilde> Gunlance is the way
[1:27:35] <Jim_Placebo> Charge Blade?
[1:27:36] <Darthkitten_Prime> Does Paige know about elemental statuses yet?
[1:27:37] <winner_92> eg
[1:27:39] <Radioactivetaco9> "fun"
[1:27:40] <%GinAndRoses> bow time
[1:27:42] <Blank9> switchaxe is always good
[1:27:44] <koffeemancer> Hey pat, x+a in the air for a downward thrust
[1:27:44] <Cosairen> "fun
[1:27:45] <vonmaultke> Gunlance? blast dash in
[1:27:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I just play Charge Blade, it does it all B)
[1:27:46] <Cosairen> "
[1:27:51] <yukichocomilk> the other y+b skill for sns is amazing because of all the easy jumps and shield bashes
[1:27:53] <Treasure_Vault> fun
[1:27:53] <Dzikka> "fun"
[1:27:57] <winner_92> is charge blade the one where you need a PhD in order to play it properly
[1:28:04] <Aussie_Manny> Can I offer you a nice egg in this tryin' time? 🥚 TakeNRG
[1:28:09] <%tank7013> Yea
[1:28:10] <Zeif00> egg n chegg
[1:28:13] <Cosairen> eggs arent so bad in rise atleast
[1:28:14] <sheepymcsheeperton> Yeah x + a downward aerial thrust good
[1:28:14] <DensityD> GrEgg
[1:28:20] <RedHotBoss> Lance or Gunlance. everyone else is a coward who rolls away from the monsters
[1:28:26] <Ardailec> @winner_92 Nah, just a Bachelors
[1:28:26] <%YakumoYomi> Man, playing the PC version from the start made me remember how silly Evade Extender is in Rise.
[1:28:29] <Profmcstevie> Who cares about playing properly, Charge Blade can be as easy as "BUILD JUICE, INJECT JUICE, BIG JUICE SLAM"
[1:28:30] <fairore> @winner_92 what no......
[1:28:37] <Lagzlot> Recently picked up SnS in Rise. I've been using so many shield bash combos that the "sword" part seems to just be a suggestion. Rise's secret monk class?
[1:28:38] <JackaxeAM> Isn't SnS a stun weapon in this one?
[1:28:43] <+Vigonept> if ya do the rush combo you get a big damaging aerial attack
[1:28:47] <%tank7013> @RedHotBoss As opposed to the coward that hides behind a shield?
[1:28:56] <%brisk_dacat> A long sword will get that tail.
[1:28:57] <+doinksinparadise> yoooo a horn homie
[1:28:58] <GMKGoat> Tail cut on Barroth with only a sns is pretty rough
[1:28:59] <Cosairen> his stun threshold is so fuckin high
[1:29:02] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Is it still worth it to play World? I have it but haven't gotten around to it.
[1:29:05] <RedHotBoss> @tank7013 who holds his ground you mean
[1:29:05] <Thunder_Lariatto> Has paige seen khezu yet?
[1:29:08] <tanarath> Should have gotten a big knife.
[1:29:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, people think Charge Blade is complex but it's just a big ungabunga weapon weapon really
[1:29:23] <Profmcstevie> No education, only smack
[1:29:23] <DensityD> tail damage is tail damage, just need a cutting damage to finishing blow
[1:29:26] <+Sirius_6> @essence_of_lariatto That was their previous hunt, they triple-carted
[1:29:29] <%octotasty> can you cut this guys' tail? I think you can just break it
[1:29:34] <Make_me_mad> @SaphronBlackbourne I'm replaying world on PC right now. It's still fantastic.
[1:29:37] <%dekkitout> @Valentinius_Anodyne I still miss SAED spam
[1:29:38] <+Sirius_6> @essence_of_lariatto By "they" I mean Pat twice and Paige once
[1:29:39] <Blank9> insect glaive coolest
[1:29:41] <+AWr00tBear> Pat should use Sns Perfect Rush move more
[1:29:44] <Profmcstevie> The tail do come off
[1:29:48] <%IamGrapes> lol little Pat can't reach
[1:29:51] <Treasure_Vault> As a hammer main, I slapped a gold rathian's tail for 30 minutes with a katana until he died and it still didn't fall off. I only understand break face.
[1:29:52] <owensleftfoot> @YakumoYomi Yea, EE1 in Rise has like the same distance as EE3 in World
[1:29:54] <sirtommygunn> Pat trying to hit this tail is really sad
[1:29:56] <+NobuuNobuu> short arms can't reach the tail
[1:29:56] <%king_wragles> @octotasty You 100% can
[1:29:59] <vonmaultke> @RedHotBoss As a GL & Lancer i whole heartily agree.

[1:31:12] <+TQuick101> basically poachers
[1:31:16] <Profmcstevie> can always sell mats from monsters you don't need, quick cash
[1:31:16] <%tank7013> @RedHotBoss Hell no I'm terrible at it. I'm just playing around as well anyway LUL
[1:31:18] <%Monkeyweed21> MURDER FOR ENVIRONMENT
[1:31:19] <DensityD> MDK
[1:31:22] <owensleftfoot> BTW tell Paige skeletons are monsters
[1:31:24] <+Sirius_6> @MidnightBasker Yeah, click in the right stick to pick a monster then RB/R1 to snap the camera in its direction
[1:31:25] <%tank7013> And no I don't use dbs
[1:31:32] <+AWr00tBear> Plague Dog probably has Para
[1:31:33] <%dekkitout> What does lady barroth hear look like?
[1:31:34] <Thunder_Lariatto> it's not as good as diablos
[1:31:35] <Mattais88> Jyradotus is the coolest
[1:31:36] <Aussie_Manny> good job everyone doodShake
[1:31:40] <Estwilde> I mean, yeah
[1:31:42] <vonmaultke> Barroth set looks dumb as hell till the G version

[1:31:44] <Estwilde> obvs
[1:31:45] <tanarath> CORRECT
[1:31:45] <sirtommygunn> cool as shit is very accurate, because shit is not cool
[1:31:45] <owensleftfoot> @DensityD That game was awesome
[1:31:45] <%hairtoday> humans are the real monsters
[1:31:46] <GMKGoat> You have a monster inside you just waiting to pop out
[1:31:48] <sheepymcsheeperton> It’s like cool mud rook knight armor
[1:31:49] <DianaTheAscian> YEAH
[1:31:49] <%king_wragles> She's so close to figuring it out
[1:31:49] <Cosairen> barroth hammer has reverse crit :(
[1:31:52] <Profmcstevie> deep down, yeh
[1:31:52] <+MidnightBasker> @Sirius_6 Do you have to do that every time to lock on or does it stay on the monster?
[1:31:53] <Aussie_Manny> yeh
[1:31:54] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I'm a meat puppet, piloted by a skeleton
[1:31:54] <Treasure_Vault> Does Rise have a boss as bad as Alatreon?
[1:31:55] <%TrafficCohen> Humanity is the biggest monster: All fiction ever
[1:31:55] <%baka_sugoi> E AR TH
[1:31:58] <@QueequegTheater> No, that's not how it works paige
[1:31:58] <+Vigonept> HUmAns are the real monsters
[1:32:02] <mortificent> Yeah
[1:32:03] <valstriam> Yeah, that moral has been run to the ground by movies and games
[1:32:05] <Zeif00> every time you sit down, a skeleton sits down
[1:32:07] <+CptCreampuff16> Female Radobaan armor from world was my favorite
[1:32:15] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I am also, a monster
[1:32:16] <%TrafficCohen> @Treasure_Vault They're all pretty decent
[1:32:16] <EASrake> The skeleton inside me is a separate entity
[1:32:17] <%zarkazeon> they need to bring my boy Agnaktor  back. THATS an amazing looking set
[1:32:21] <0mnis_edge> Kulu hammer is good for now.
[1:32:25] <%tank7013> @RedHotBoss doodShake
[1:32:26] <%TheDullaMAN> Shoot a gun
[1:32:33] <%Axellogic> Lance is fun
[1:32:37] <+JupiterDjin> We're a brain, stuck in a skeletal cage that is constantly wet and layered with meat.
[1:32:38] <Blank9> tether up
[1:32:38] <Profmcstevie> Time for counters
[1:32:38] <DensityD> Conga La La La La La
[1:32:39] <@QueequegTheater> >HR105 holy shit Plague
[1:32:41] <%Axellogic> The lance dash is amazing in Rise
[1:32:41] <Cosairen> bring nerscylla back you cowards
[1:32:45] <fairore> I love using dual blades x Paralyzed is my favorite  combination
[1:32:48] <vonmaultke> Lance got the boot in this one
[1:32:48] <+JinjaBreadMan757> it's pretty good tho
[1:32:49] <+TestAnon> I'm loving Lance right now
[1:32:50] <%Agami23> yeah
[1:32:51] <+Sirius_6> @MidnightBasker Depends on your camera settings. Default is tap R1 to snap the camera, but you can set the camera to always follow the focused monster'
[1:32:53] <%ElkRiverDog> If we want to get existential about it the earth is basically one giant boneyard
[1:32:55] <+DrTribal> i like gunlance alot but ive never played lance
[1:32:57] <DensityD> power creeeeeeeeep
[1:32:57] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:32:59] <%Agami23> it felt way better in world
[1:33:02] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Plague is a whole 100 hunter ranks above me
[1:33:03] <Profmcstevie> Hopefully Sunbreak retools Lance a bit
[1:33:03] <sheepymcsheeperton> Plague is super right
[1:33:03] <JonnyJug> Lance gets a lot better with switch skills
[1:33:07] <DaKnightWarrior> Yeah, Lance is off in Rise.
[1:33:08] <RedHotBoss> Lance re-fit is awkward but I am stubborn so I make do
[1:33:09] <%tank7013> I've seen some fucked up stuff you can do with lance but you have to kinda go wild with it. Not really what you'd expect from it
[1:33:14] <+TestAnon> booo this man
[1:33:21] <+SilverDevilfish> Teach her the big slam
[1:33:21] <Hellhound90008> They looked at World lance and decided to completely ruin it
[1:33:21] <%TheDullaMAN> Uh huh.
[1:33:23] <DensityD> just jackin off
[1:33:24] <@QueequegTheater> How does the glaive feel? I loved it in World
[1:33:24] <Treasure_Vault> I love advanced hammer tricks! Teach her the ledge spam attack.
[1:33:24] <%GinAndRoses> calm down
[1:33:25] <Aussie_Manny> calm down, woman
[1:33:26] <sheepymcsheeperton> Lance is good in rise but playing it optimally is super not normal Lance
[1:33:31] <+MidnightBasker> @Sirius_6 thank you so much! That might be whats stopping me from liking MHR!
[1:33:34] <square__1> hammer high
[1:33:37] <%ChrisPlaysThing> 8:30 PM, tiem for your Dick Flattening
[1:33:40] <heli0hso> Cool it
[1:33:43] <DaKnightWarrior> Nargi hammer is super good.
[1:33:44] <+Vigonept> i love how wild paige is acting only to be met with "uh huh and ye"
[1:33:52] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I mean, they basically have a skeleton ready to go for Nerscylla, so it seems like a shoe-in for Sunbreak
[1:33:53] <Lagzlot> I used to play lance in 3 and 3U until brachydios taught me that some turtling weapons will just screw you against certain monsters.
[1:34:07] <JackaxeAM> That's the little izuchi
[1:34:10] <fairore> @hellhound90008 stop using  your dark soul brain
[1:34:11] <+SilverDevilfish> Remember when they nerfed Lance in Iceborne for absolutely no good reason? Good times Kappa
[1:34:11] <+AWr00tBear> Gun Hammer Gun Hammer!
[1:34:11] <%ArceusStarDestroyer> Why did you shave your glorious beard??
[1:34:12] <Cosairen> i got the hr narga hammer today that thing is nuts
[1:34:19] <sheepymcsheeperton> World Lance is perfect
[1:34:29] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Kulu hammer 2 is good
[1:34:33] <+kujofire990> kujofire990 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 50 months! 
[1:34:33] <%TrafficCohen> Damn, Hr105 on PC?
[1:34:38] <%TrafficCohen> That's some grinding
[1:34:39] <+Akanesasusora> paige might need to check to see if she's missing parts for forging it, as opposed to upgrading to it
[1:34:41] <%ChrisPlaysThing> ore is also good
[1:34:56] <+Sirius_6> @QueequegTheater They made some changes to Kinsects. World's style is now one bug type called Powder. There's also kinsects that augment some attacks (Assist), ones that fly a lot faster (Speed). They also get a neat Silkbind attack to dive directly downward for massive damage
[1:35:05] <vonmaultke> Lance does have the shield bash which is nice but the other changes were counter to my idea of lance (Guards, hops and pokes)
[1:35:41] <+Fetrigon> FUZZY EGG BOY
[1:35:41] <rasamune> Letters
[1:35:46] <vonmaultke> Swipes and launches feel stupi for the Lance
[1:35:48] <@QueequegTheater> @Sirius_6 Can I still unga bunga with the spin attack tho nagHmm
[1:35:49] <+Fetrigon> majinoNeko dolphinPls majinoNeko dolphinPls majinoNeko
[1:35:51] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> LeRouch_the_Rebel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! Hey Pat, just wanted to say that I personally like R6 extraction, and Doc Squiddy does as well, so that's at least 2 people! Keep up the good work.
[1:36:01] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Does Paige just need a ps4 controller? i have like 3, i could just give you one
[1:36:04] <%tank7013> Some late game kinsects can grab two extracts at once yea?
[1:36:12] <owensleftfoot> @QueequegTheater IG is fucking amazing in rise, probably the best it's ever been in the series
[1:36:12] <Lagzlot> Too bad seltas isn't in Rise. RIP it's hammer.
[1:36:21] <sheepymcsheeperton> @vonmaultke Agreed
[1:36:30] <Cosairen> wait did they make the old dragoon dive a silkbind?
[1:36:33] <+Fetrigon> @queequegtheater You'll still try anyway. So why ask? LUL
[1:36:34] <Darthkitten_Prime> Wow if only someone managed to cut the tail during that last hunt
[1:36:34] <GarbageNirvana> More weird bugs in MH dammit
[1:36:37] <fairore> @lagzlot RIP is cool amor
[1:36:39] <%tank7013> I miss Seltas so much. Those weapons were sick
[1:36:41] <TrollKing96> I want these 3 to go through the Lost Planet 2 campaign.
[1:36:49] <+Vigonept> its wild to me how popular mh is now
[1:37:02] <+Sirius_6> @QueequegTheater The aerial helicopter feels better in Rise, has the same "only 3 times before landing" restriction but does more damage than it did in World
[1:37:11] <Cosairen> all the bug monsters from the old gens were so cool their gear is so cool
[1:37:17] <%tank7013> I miss nerscyilla too but if it means getting gypceros back that shit can stay gone
[1:37:30] <@QueequegTheater> @Fetrigon But big number tho
[1:37:32] <Daemyx> didn't she already made an izuchi hammer on the first time she played?
[1:37:34] <@QueequegTheater> @Sirius_6 Nice
[1:37:34] <%TrafficCohen> They lay eggs
[1:37:35] <thesoldierofjoy> he speaks the truth.
[1:37:36] <+Vigonept> SHE IS THO
[1:37:38] <Cosairen> fuck gypceros
[1:37:46] <owensleftfoot> @Sirius_6 Also the Assist type kinsects that let you gather two extracts at once, great QOL change
[1:37:47] <@QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater nagGasm
[1:37:48] <%MidnightBurst12> he's right tho
[1:37:51] <Mattais88> Rakna Kadachi is such a fun fight
[1:37:53] <Hellhound90008> Rondines sister tho
[1:37:55] <sold515> shes got them halo elite legs
[1:37:57] <%cvp5127> thats hot
[1:37:58] <Ardailec> Hinoa is cute tho
[1:37:59] <JonnyJug> Minoto also uses a lance
[1:38:00] <%TrafficCohen> She likes drawings
[1:38:05] <fairore> @tank7013 come on man hes not bad
[1:38:08] <+Vigonept> plague spitting facts
[1:38:09] <%octotasty> she's not doing paperwork. She's drawing
[1:38:10] <JackaxeAM> Plague is correct/
[1:38:10] <$SGrim> Plague is correct
[1:38:10] <RedHotBoss> Minoto best Waifu
[1:38:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> get you a girl that eats
[1:38:13] <+Pachi3000> it's relatable
[1:38:13] <Blank9> one big thing that helps with IG is you can cancel out of the end of attack animations by sending/recalling kinsects
[1:38:14] <+2DSuperiority> all beaten by moon cat m2kAY
[1:38:17] <DianaTheAscian> Plauge is right
[1:38:18] <%TerpanderLux> women who eat 🙄
[1:38:18] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Some just lie
[1:38:20] <+Romuken> eat the orb
[1:38:20] <%YakumoYomi> Not surprised Eli prefers Mikoto
[1:38:22] <%tank7013> @fairore I hate them so much
[1:38:23] <Hellhound90008> well she gets angry at her shitty art
[1:38:24] <%baka_sugoi> woolieGIRLS woolieGIRLS woolieGIRLS
[1:38:24] <%FunkyStreams> some girls eat themselves
[1:38:28] <%cade_calrayn> not Paige, she can only eat when Pat isn't talking
[1:38:28] <%TrafficCohen> I like one of those eating girls
[1:38:28] <%IamGrapes> Plague is super right
[1:38:30] <Aussie_Manny> dooder
[1:38:31] <%dekkitout> I am become doot, dooter of worlds
[1:38:31] <+Pachi3000> yeeeep
[1:38:34] <sheepymcsheeperton> Minoto screaming randomly is funny but gets annoying
[1:38:35] <sold515> minoto>hinoa
[1:38:36] <+Pachi3000> you'd be in already otherwise
[1:38:39] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Minoto get's upset cause her drawings aren't as good as she wants.... it's not paperwork!!
[1:38:52] <Cosairen> if hinoa says bunny dango is a little taste of heaven to me again im gonna scream
[1:38:54] <+Pachi3000> Monster Hunter HATES Plague
[1:38:55] <thesoldierofjoy> kinda funny how the two previous gen's quest girls were one who liked to draw and one who liked to eat. now we got both
[1:38:55] <%TerpanderLux> what if the cutscene forced him into the instance lol
[1:38:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> that's some wack shit
[1:38:59] <fairore> weird

[1:39:10] <+Fetrigon> Does plague have access to starlink?
[1:39:11] <+AWr00tBear> maybe its online Snow Map?
[1:39:17] <+Vigonept> @zeif00 coward
[1:39:18] <owensleftfoot> DOES SHE?
[1:39:19] <%Agami23> it might be this map. this was the same map as the khezu
[1:39:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> training wheels off
[1:39:23] <GrimAngel01> is it the map? it was the second time it was the ice area
[1:39:24] <+Sirius_6> @owensleftfoot Yes, the dual extract kinsects are very nice. Helps with the issues some monsters have for collecting essence (like getting orange from Tobi-Kadachi)
[1:39:43] <Cosairen> west tn is the same way
[1:39:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> what's california?

[1:41:33] <Estwilde> Channel your inner skeleton
[1:41:36] <JonnyJug> Maybe the ice map is causing loading issues?
[1:41:42] <%cade_calrayn> isn't it against ToS to doot yourself on stream, Pat?
[1:41:49] <%tank7013> It doesn't matter if you're from the US or Canada, we all live in the cum zone together
[1:41:49] <GMKGoat> I love how easy Izuchi is to stun
[1:41:49] <thesoldierofjoy> America is a bunch of nonsense, cars, and hearty pies
[1:41:50] <vonmaultke> California is a blight on the map, why the fuck do you move to a place that has to pump in all of its water
[1:41:50] <Aussie_Manny> Play us the song of your people, Pat! lytJIVE
[1:42:04] <artificiallynatural> I love the way izuchi spins when it topples

[1:42:51] <%TrafficCohen> These animals do not properly dispose of their car batteries
[1:42:52] <yukichocomilk> izuchi commits tax evasion
[1:42:52] <Cosairen> you gotta have the 3 main melodies played iirc
[1:42:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I am Trash Man
[1:42:56] <%GinAndRoses> don't forget your infernal melody
[1:42:56] <GMKGoat> It's R2 after a Mag Trio for Infernal Melody iirc?
[1:43:00] <artificiallynatural> did plague disconnect?
[1:43:07] <%cooldude69xx> Izuchi jaywalks
[1:43:17] <%GinAndRoses> after mag trip or slide beat yeah
[1:43:24] <owensleftfoot> Do they disappear? I thought that was only in Old games
[1:43:29] <Cosairen> izuchi walked within the punishers zone of crime
[1:43:30] <%GinAndRoses> trio even
[1:43:48] <Treasure_Vault> Plague must learn to constantly uppercut Pat whenever possible with hammer. Consider it accuracy training.
[1:43:50] <+Pachi3000> I think smaller mob corpses will disappear eventually
[1:43:52] <Treasure_Vault> Paige*
[1:44:16] <%cherryburnout> did plague die?
[1:44:36] <+Pachi3000> Plague's internet is being poopy

[1:44:53] <Cosairen> i like how spin horning was so powerful they made it a super
[1:44:58] <+rbakervv> @cherryburnout something in his system and/or network is causing his game to lockup everytime he tries to join a game
[1:45:28] <Aussie_Manny> yoink
[1:45:37] <%ChrisPlaysThing> GrEgg would probably be best in the top right, no one really needs to see the focus icons
[1:45:57] <TIME_PUNCHER> This Brutal Legend mod looks sick
[1:46:03] <Manwad> cant believe they gave hunting horn a fucking install
[1:46:05] <Cosairen> the counter corner horner meter
[1:46:13] <+SuichiTanaka> I find Magnificent Trio has to be canceled out of from other attacks. And Infernal Melody provides an Attack Up buff.
[1:46:20] <DensityD> that's a KO
[1:46:23] <YamChop> you can do it after you Wirebug Triangle attack too
[1:46:31] <DensityD> that's an Infernal Melody
[1:46:35] <DrkJP520> You can also press R2 after the R2+triangle wire skill iirc
[1:46:47] <GMKGoat> Earthshaker so good
[1:46:55] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Damn that's a sick HH combo. Guess it's time to buy this game.
[1:46:58] <Afterman_> hunting horn is super good late game
[1:47:00] <DensityD> s t r e a m l i n e d
[1:47:01] <sfah_tham> did Pat do the black dragons in World??
[1:47:06] <Estwilde> I enjoyed HH a lot in World
[1:47:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hunting Horn feels great in this
[1:47:12] <+Skypepper1> Apparently ALOT of people had the thought "THIS will be the MH I try hunting horn on."
[1:47:15] <GMKGoat> It's not quite the old version
[1:47:16] <Cosairen> old horn was jank
[1:47:20] <+TestAnon> It's not the same smh
[1:47:24] <+Sirius_6> It's a Switch Skill to use the older HH style, yeah
[1:47:24] <Afterman_> correct
[1:47:25] <YamChop> its good for a pure healing build
[1:47:25] <+NotaryRotary> I loved the jank of World HH but rise is cool too
[1:47:26] <sfah_tham> oh hh in world is ok
[1:47:27] <+Pachi3000> it's true
[1:47:32] <+SuichiTanaka> The new HH is so easy you can just mash it to win.
[1:47:33] <tigerfang86> shit is LAME sometimes
[1:47:38] <%RetroCop87> but Japan game developement, tho
[1:47:42] <DensityD> Jebaited
[1:47:42] <Fenlig> Like those really dumb looking guns and animations
[1:47:42] <$Emperor_Machinus> what if they brought back underwater combat though?
[1:47:42] <%GinAndRoses> lmao
[1:47:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> wait you HUNT the monsters?
[1:47:43] <%shurtal> quelle surprise
[1:47:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> wtf
[1:47:47] <+TestAnon> you should see HH in FU THAT shit was jank
[1:47:47] <%Vyskus> I still miss Unite :sadge:
[1:47:50] <owensleftfoot> MH fans have stockholm syndrome
[1:47:57] <%TerpanderLux> i dont like the follow up moves horn got but im a crazy person so
[1:48:06] <yukichocomilk> OG players tend to be idiots
[1:48:12] <%RoninRorinth> pat really loves long things'
[1:48:14] <+Pachi3000> When you whiff on hammer you're wide open for like 10 minutes
[1:48:16] <DensityD> yay
[1:48:17] <usuallysleepy> yeah lets turn monster hunter into a 1 button boss basher lol
[1:48:18] <GarbageNirvana> long hammer
[1:48:23] <%blistexthief> Pat is a size queen confirmed, only likes it because it's longer
[1:48:23] <sfah_tham> but did he do the black dragons yet?
[1:48:25] <%GinAndRoses> HH is that good shit
[1:48:26] <%FacetiousAF> also buffs
[1:48:28] <thesoldierofjoy> HH in World actually out-DPS's hammer, it just doesnt seem like it because you have to stop to perform.
[1:48:29] <%TrafficCohen> THE MACE
[1:48:30] <Lagzlot> For some reason I thought the complaint was that the new hh was TOO good and an all HH team could stunlock a monster to death spamming the finisher.
[1:48:31] <Aussie_Manny> 2020Victory 2020Victory 2020Victory
[1:48:32] <%Monkeyweed21> Iceborne solved the range with the clutch claw followups
[1:48:35] <%skeletonmilk> that "mine now" sounded actually like paige irl
[1:48:37] <+HarryWizard> thats why i like THE GUN
[1:48:43] <%RetroCop87> look at that 15FPS fish in the BG
[1:48:44] <JonnyJug> New HH is just a completely different playstyle
[1:48:51] <%IamGrapes> LUL
[1:48:54] <Afterman_> that doesnt even make any sense
[1:48:58] <Afterman_> a one button basher lol
[1:49:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> no
[1:49:00] <%Agami23> remember when the attack moves were on the analog stick?
[1:49:01] <%TrafficCohen> No
[1:49:01] <%ChrisPlaysThing> nope, we can't
[1:49:04] <rasamune> Hunting Horn :V
[1:49:05] <%baka_sugoi> Its a fun and confusing game
[1:49:06] <twoah> Horn doesn’t play songs through attacks now, kinda defeats the concept of the weapon. Why even have notes and a staff anymore?
[1:49:10] <%Kaask> what a goofy take
[1:49:11] <DensityD> "father, please give treats"
[1:49:12] <Blank9> a good thing with HH is R2 -> Moving A loops, when all your songs are already up
[1:49:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> what's a dog?
[1:49:16] <%TrafficCohen> @Agami23 Disgusting
[1:49:21] <+TestAnon> I liked how methodical the move set of HH used to be, and the effects of the songs used to be a lot more varied
[1:49:30] <fairore> I will say I do not like the chaos horn they made chaos horn useless
[1:49:31] <DensityD> hurry and craft full Royal Ludroth set
[1:49:43] <Treasure_Vault> Can you teach Paige how to roll of a ledge and use her jump attack to get back on the ledge? It's powerful and good for movement.
[1:49:46] <GarbageNirvana> floppy dooog
[1:49:49] <Afterman_> @twoah  some of the playing animations are also attack animations, no? I mean its been months since i touched switch rise
[1:49:54] <%TerpanderLux> testosterone
[1:49:57] <+SuichiTanaka> The switch skill for Horn turns it back so you have to perform to get the songs out. So you can swap it back to the old way.
[1:50:01] <%Monkeyweed21> nO hAvInG tO sCaVeNgE FoR wHeTsToNeS iS coMpLeXiTy
[1:50:02] <sfah_tham> aerial hammer is the shit
[1:50:03] <%RetroCop87> Cosmo?
[1:50:03] <Lagzlot> Armored bullfango.
[1:50:05] <+Pachi3000> Tetrahedron
[1:50:10] <%MegadBlitz> we SHOULD get a new game with the old system just for us to realize collectively "oh god go back to rise"
[1:50:19] <%TrafficCohen> Tetranodon
[1:50:19] <Cosairen> hh has always been that weapon that has a cult behind it and they sacrifice goats to get good at it then when it gets changed cause no one but them like it they start making the voodoo dolls
[1:50:29] <%skeletonmilk> there's only two spacedogs and their names are Argos and Cosmo
[1:50:34] <%Shonen_hero> more like hammer that bone amirite Paige?
[1:50:54] <%Kaask> izuchi has crit right
[1:51:01] <%Kaask> but yeah, probably not use that one
[1:51:05] <Cosairen> crit and green
[1:51:11] <SwindlerOfProgress> @Kaask It does, yeah
[1:51:34] <+AWr00tBear> you always want to upgrade unless you can't
[1:51:41] <+KUYAmoPESh> Go to upgrade tab
[1:51:43] <%zarkazeon> tell her about the box icon
[1:51:51] <%Kaask> true, she may as well work through all the trees she can
[1:51:54] <+Akanesasusora> izuchi hammer one can either be crafted or ugraded, which is probably what's causing the confusion
[1:51:56] <EASrake> Paige may be able to upgrade the to the hammer but not forge it
[1:51:57] <+RAWPowerStudios> Is it just me or is the stream lagging/repeating a lot?
[1:52:02] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> YEA GUNLANCE!!! LETS FUCKING GO!!!
[1:52:03] <%TrafficCohen> Even the Izuchildren
[1:52:09] <sfah_tham> just u
[1:52:10] <+AWr00tBear> upgrade or forge is a drop down menu now
[1:52:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @RAWPowerStudios Try a refresh
[1:52:25] <sfah_tham> pokeBOOMpokeBOOM
[1:52:28] <Lagzlot> You could also check if she's trying to forge or upgrade, because the recipe defaults to forge most of the time and you need to go out of your way to find the upgrade recipe.
[1:52:38] <+Pachi3000> My favorite hammer from my Switch playthrough was the Nova Crystal
[1:52:39] <owensleftfoot> THEY'RE MONSTERS, AND I SLAUGHTERED THEM LIKE MONSTERS
[1:52:39] <+TestAnon> New HH is still missing an expansive song list and the old recital moves, I'm still getting used to the move set
[1:52:42] <%baka_sugoi> psaBig psaBig number
[1:52:42] <owensleftfoot> I HATE THEM
[1:52:47] <%FunkyStreams> dead air
[1:52:49] <DensityD> LUL Guard 2 LUL
[1:52:59] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Distant yoinking
[1:53:07] <sfah_tham> ''we are the real monsters''
[1:53:24] <vonmaultke> I'm surprised Peach didn't try Greatsword first.
[1:53:34] <vonmaultke> The biggest number
[1:53:47] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Wyvern Stake still slow as the eventual heat death of the universe I see...
[1:53:51] <+Pachi3000> Pardon, I meant Super Nova
[1:53:58] <owensleftfoot> @vonmaultke Greatsword is a lot harder to use than hammer
[1:53:58] <yukichocomilk> YOINK
[1:54:02] <Treasure_Vault> Can you ask Plague to teach Paige the ledge attack spam trick for hammer? Unless he hates it for Plague reasons, which would also be interesting to listen to.
[1:54:12] <+Pachi3000> You really should be able to trade items
[1:54:12] <%TerpanderLux> belts
[1:54:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's that desire sensor
[1:54:16] <+Pachi3000> Why we can't do that
[1:54:25] <thesoldierofjoy> Barroth armor is pretty good early on. If she wants armor with Slugger for better bonk later, Anjanath has it.
[1:54:29] <sfah_tham> nah
[1:54:29] <+TestAnon> yeah but at least you can fast stake after the wirebug guard and charged shots, that's really the best way
[1:54:45] <%sidneymiller> sidneymiller subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Why do you hate the crunchy peanut butter its the best one
[1:54:54] <+TestAnon> one of the hardest things I've learned with GL is not trying to stake after every combo because you WILL be punished
[1:54:59] <%RetroCop87> YOU GOT BOOST POWER
[1:55:05] <+AWr00tBear> Hammer is easier than Great Sword as soon as you unlock Meteor impact wireart
[1:55:11] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @TestAnon Yep
[1:55:22] <+Pachi3000> She'll almost assuredly get some in quest rewards lol
[1:55:25] <+Pachi3000> Potassium
[1:55:30] <%TrafficCohen> Sick?
[1:55:31] <Lagzlot> 20 of these AND the quest rewards.
[1:55:34] <%TerpanderLux> banbabas
[1:55:35] <%FacetiousAF> maybe she didn't do the wishlisting??
[1:55:41] <%BinaryFireball> patassium
[1:55:45] <DrkJP520> i guess whatever level hammer she needed to upgrade wasn't on the wishlist
[1:55:46] <%FacetiousAF> YEAH GL
[1:55:47] <%dekkitout> @TestAnon Swinglance > staking
[1:55:49] <%RetroCop87> watch him disconnect before he gets to them
[1:55:51] <%IamGrapes> more like PATtassium
[1:55:53] <JonnyJug> Or the ice map!
[1:55:55] <+Pachi3000> Even the hunters are happy!
[1:55:57] <Treasure_Vault> Eyyyyy
[1:56:11] <+AWr00tBear> Plague has to try onlin
[1:56:15] <%Treuan> It feels so much like boar drifting
[1:56:19] <+BigWayneX> @AWr00tBear So Immediatey, cause you have it when you start the game
[1:56:20] <sheepymcsheeperton> Hope it works Eli
[1:56:30] <%Bailey__Gaming> I'm not sure Eli wants to HUNT the monsters per say
[1:56:32] <DensityD> must capture
[1:56:44] <DensityD> negative affinity
[1:56:44] <Ardailec> Aren't all Barroth weapons High raw, negative affinity?
[1:56:47] <owensleftfoot> God the kamura hammer looks so fucking sick
[1:56:48] <%TerpanderLux> go ahead :)
[1:56:48] <+TestAnon> I LOVE barroth HH
[1:56:54] <%MegadBlitz> there's SOME exceptions
[1:56:56] <ZweihanderSteve> iirc barroth stuff in general is good for low rank
[1:56:56] <%RetroCop87> JESUS
[1:57:01] <SaltyAzteca> Electrochemistry, GO
[1:57:08] <+TestAnon> the songs it has in Rise kinda suck unfortently
[1:57:10] <+The_creepiest_man_in_chat> affinity doesn't matter with GL, right?
[1:57:11] <sheepymcsheeperton> LOL
[1:57:14] <DensityD> it's about Pat kissing the Tall, slim Homie
[1:57:35] <+ALazo> o wow, small monster location is synched. In what game did that get sorted out?
[1:57:42] <sfah_tham> if you use the gun part it doesnt
[1:57:44] <Aussie_Manny> Yay, materials! brodayPOG
[1:57:56] <%Nekros4442> You dont need to charge to 3
[1:58:12] <owensleftfoot> @The_creepiest_man_in_chat  nah not really. affinity doesnt affect shelling so it's not worth it for GL
[1:58:27] <%TerpanderLux> and that dash has i-frames its so cool
[1:58:36] <Treasure_Vault> Need to let you hold the swap button as the level starts to start in the other mode, like Zelda in smash
[1:58:40] <%Bailey__Gaming> Bonk those monsters to Horny Jail Paige!
[1:58:51] <%Nekros4442> yep, the stance switch lets you do two level 3 moves back to back
[1:58:53] <sfah_tham> tho some slashing combos are high damage so affinity is good
[1:58:59] <DensityD> hunting helpers
[1:59:31] <Cosairen> just go into sword oath you dont need the extra aggro LUL
[1:59:42] <Profmcstevie> The BIGGEST bonk
[2:00:16] <sfah_tham> if only they could implement the  controlled riding into World..
[2:00:21] <%Agami23> RT??
[2:00:42] <+ALazo> the reticle when she has her weapon sheathed
[2:00:47] <sheepysenka> she's getting confused by the sheathed targeted one again
[2:00:51] <+AWr00tBear> hold LT
[2:00:52] <Zombrocom> She is talking about the aimed wirebug dash
[2:00:55] <Cosairen> its just the tutorial
[2:00:56] <%TerpanderLux> RT
[2:00:58] <DensityD> what does the Full thing say, paige?
[2:00:58] <%Agami23> oh. she is aiming with LT
[2:00:58] <koffeemancer> I think she means the reticle that pops up when you have your weapon sheathed
[2:01:00] <Zombrocom> With the sheathed weapon
[2:01:02] <+Jaromero435> the wirebug targeting
[2:01:03] <%skeletonmilk> i think she's referring to wirebug latching points?
[2:01:03] <Daemyx> The aiming reticle
[2:01:05] <%Focant> you get tutorial popups sometimes
[2:01:06] <Manwad> oh its when you have like a kunai or a throwable out
[2:01:07] <JonnyJug> Tutorial popup
[2:01:09] <%Focant> can be confusing
[2:01:10] <DensityD> press RT to charge?!!? what's the full sentence
[2:01:10] <Manwad> in your inventory
[2:01:13] <Darthkitten_Prime> When you hold LT and aim, it says RT
[2:01:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Are ya moving a mouse?
[2:01:15] <Cosairen> OH she means with the bug out
[2:01:17] <%FacetiousAF> Reticle
[2:01:20] <%Nekros4442> I assume she means the silkbind reticle
[2:01:21] <sheepysenka> she gets confused by the aimable every single time she strems
[2:01:25] <sfah_tham> YOU DONT KILL YOUR FAIMLY?!
[2:01:29] <%TerpanderLux> thats to spiderman around
[2:01:29] <sfah_tham> oh man
[2:01:40] <DensityD> JEEEEEZ
[2:01:44] <%Bailey__Gaming> Big Atits
[2:01:45] <Zombrocom> Wirebug button does something different if weapon is out or not
[2:01:51] <%FunkyStreams> try talking to your family, about killing them.
[2:01:57] <+DizzyGunner> chat be nice
[2:01:59] <DensityD> the -itis
[2:02:00] <+TestAnon> what if I need to kill them to upgrade my great sword?
[2:02:17] <%notsoy> the character looked like majima for a second there lol
[2:02:28] <DrkJP520> Wire jump with your face buttons instead of R2, and the wirebug will recover faster
[2:02:42] <%Dakuu75> Plague is HR105 jesus christ
[2:02:43] <%Nobrev> does paige have auto sheathe turned on?
[2:02:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> Greg your character looks like what anime thinks a badass pirate would look like
[2:02:56] <twoah> Can’t wait to hear them explain valor style when she unlocks it
[2:03:09] <sfah_tham> did Greg do the black dragons in world?
[2:03:09] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:03:14] <%notsoy> how is insect glaive these days anyway? that was my main in 4u
[2:03:29] <+Pachi3000> That means you're upgrading from the previous weapon
[2:03:32] <Cosairen> valor style sucks
[2:03:49] <%Nekros4442> Just upgrade Paige
[2:03:53] <+Pachi3000> Some weapon upgrades take extra scraps
[2:04:04] <%Nekros4442> Just gotta tape on some extra monster bits
[2:04:05] <twoah> @cosairen I agree, in this game it’s annoying to use
[2:04:10] <Daemyx> Just generic materials
[2:04:11] <%TerpanderLux> :)
[2:04:20] <Zombrocom> Its too reduce material RNG
[2:04:26] <%blastyoboots> nobody wants to know pat 8)
[2:04:29] <sfah_tham> but will he tell them?
[2:04:38] <DensityD> does the insect glaive have quote-unquote long reach?
[2:04:40] <Zombrocom> So any material you get works to upgrade your stuffs
[2:04:48] <%TerpanderLux> uh ohhhh
[2:04:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> bone go up
[2:04:51] <Darthkitten_Prime> It's for the parts that you get a lot of
[2:04:53] <Ris_Eltrut> Only Pat will know
[2:04:58] <%TheWinged7> yeah you can downgrade
[2:05:02] <+AWr00tBear> @Plague it's solution for an old upgrade mechanic
[2:05:02] <Darthkitten_Prime> helps smooth out RNG
[2:05:05] <Cosairen> @DensityD 1not really
[2:05:08] <square__1> she now has 4 bone hammer
[2:05:14] <Coystick> PANIC
[2:05:15] <+Shoosler> you upgrade the bone weapon to other stuff tho
[2:05:24] <Aussie_Manny> doodMash
[2:05:28] <+Pachi3000> you can revert upgrades anyway
[2:05:31] <%zarkazeon> go up and help her?
[2:05:32] <%TerpanderLux> to get to barroth hammer
[2:05:40] <Lagzlot> It's more convenient than having a convoluted checklist of items like some previous MH games, like when you have a billion of items 1-5 but item 6 won't drop.
[2:05:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> its a tree

[2:05:47] <yukichocomilk> NotLikeThis mind goblins
[2:05:51] <simplyvince15> Shouldn't Paige just switch over to the other tabs for upgrading?

[2:08:12] <%thedankestmeeme> pat's belly
[2:08:12] <%IamGrapes> @PatStaresAt also I'm pretty sure she didnt have two bone hammers, she just crated an Izuchi hammer from scratch instead of upgrading the bone hammer
[2:08:20] <sfah_tham> they got the dude who detailed the RDR2 horse balls
[2:08:23] <+Fetrigon> creepy49Porpchamp creepy49Uhhh
[2:08:59] <%TerpanderLux> its fine whatever
[2:09:06] <$Galeont> Yoooo, Gunlance is sweet!
[2:09:14] <%blastyoboots> it DOES tell you the icons are just VERY SMALL
[2:09:14] <Treasure_Vault> If only she could see
[2:09:18] <+Pachi3000> There's a symbol next to the weapon if you own one
[2:09:19] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Pat, you're saying this to the woman who just takes the first train she sees in Japan
[2:09:20] <%blastyoboots> and hard to see when you are blind
[2:09:22] <+Jaromero435> tell her there are little icons on the tree
[2:09:24] <Zombrocom> If you already have it, there will be a little box icon on it
[2:09:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[2:09:25] <%TerpanderLux> paige hasnt played a weird freakazoid game like this before so its a bit daunting
[2:09:31] <+Ophill> Theres a chest icon if you aready have one
[2:09:32] <%Axellogic> Theres a little box next to weapons you have crafted already
[2:09:41] <%blastyoboots> she WHAT D8
[2:09:42] <Treasure_Vault> Monster Hunter has dumb mechanics? NO
[2:09:46] <+Pachi3000> There's two like right at the tree at the start, Pat
[2:09:47] <Treasure_Vault> impossible can't be
[2:09:49] <sheepymcsheeperton> Yay!
[2:09:53] <%blastyoboots> @ChrisPlaysThing she WHAT? D8
[2:09:59] <%TerpanderLux> that one :)
[2:09:59] <%luckysteak> there are literally 2 east of the camp
[2:09:59] <+Pachi3000> If you go straight
[2:10:02] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Paige loves her Hussy
[2:10:02] <+Pachi3000> from the camp
[2:10:05] <+UbiquitousLost> there is a small red box inthe corner of the weapon icons in the weapon upgrade tree that tells you if you own it or not
[2:10:09] <DrkJP520> no, the other tree
[2:10:12] <Lagzlot> The menu is a little annoying that way. If it's a craftable weapon, it defaults to forge instead of upgrade. Same for the parts list (shows forge recipe and you need to dig into the menu for the upgrade parts).
[2:10:12] <%BubbaRands> Horsey go Bark Bark
[2:10:17] <+Pachi3000> this tree
[2:10:17] <%baka_sugoi> based tree
[2:10:19] <thesoldierofjoy> zone 2
[2:10:20] <+CptCreampuff16> If theres a little chest symbol by the weapon that means you already have one
[2:10:22] <Coystick> The dinner bell in the restaurant sound exactly like the emergency shutdown bell in my building's elevator, which is super unstable so you get trapped often, so every time a meal is ready in game I get super anxious.
[2:10:26] <+Pachi3000> There are always 2 here
[2:10:39] <%IamGrapes> @TerpanderLux yeah i have to remind myself about that. you can get overwhelmed with everything on the screen
[2:10:40] <%blastyoboots> you're always the BIGGEST arrow
[2:10:44] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @blastyoboots She just takes the first train, no matter where it's going, so she get's lost often.
[2:10:48] <Cosairen> really wish it would stay consistent yeah

[2:10:53] <sheepymcsheeperton> Rhenopopopadopoleseses

[2:15:40] <+Pachi3000> The map does have filter but you can't use it to search small mobs
[2:15:44] <+Pachi3000> I think there are some around Area 8
[2:15:49] <Blank9> oh, I think they're in area 8
[2:15:54] <Cosairen> theres a bunch in that lil cave

[2:16:02] <+Sirius_6> @Brassnarwhal It does for map resources like mining, plants, and endemic life, but I don't think there's a filter for small monsters

[2:19:39] <%dekkitout> @Cosairen Dauntless has that funnily enough
[2:19:40] <+DizzyGunner> i thought GS was maximum unga
[2:19:41] <Lagzlot> And she's playing hammer so does that mean her bad brain day is contagious?
[2:19:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> just konk em
[2:19:48] <DensityD> I think Switch Axe is the maximum unga now, not to downplay hammer but.....
[2:19:50] <sfah_tham> HBG not ungabunga in rise?
[2:19:52] <%Fooguwu> Do you ever wonder if Paige is real
[2:19:53] <%Sotetsu> Pat, can you pay charge blade?
[2:19:55] <buerdo> greatsword is bigger Unga, bigger whiff
[2:19:59] <+AWr00tBear> I watched Max just mine for an hour in MHRise because he ran out of money. I'll watch anything Pat
[2:20:00] <%Sotetsu> I mean play...
[2:20:05] <%ChrisPlaysThing> big bunga, strong unga
[2:20:11] <%luckysteak> anyone else getting skips in the stream?
[2:20:14] <+Pachi3000> Switch Axe's main attacks are unga but there IS a meta to it, it's not like thoughtless

[2:20:35] <+DizzyGunner> ive played charge bade up to HR6 then realized how hard it actually is
[2:20:39] <%DovaDude29> @patstaresat if you had to write a 6-10 page essay on either Chocolate or Napoleon, which subject would you choose? Any idea what you’d do as a thesis?
[2:20:42] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @Peacefrog7 yes
[2:20:48] <+TestAnon> I'm currently maining 4 weapons at the same time but can't figure out CB to save my life
[2:20:53] <Darthkitten_Prime> Swaxe is do unga, get even more unga
[2:21:02] <Cosairen> theres jaggi and zamites but no great jaggi or zamitrios it sucks
[2:21:05] <Raven_In_A_Tree> Greatsword is not Unga, im a unga bunga and dont understand Greatsword wtf even is a tcs
[2:21:11] <+Peacefrog7> SICK
[2:21:15] <sfah_tham> Hammer is the Dempsey roller of MH
[2:21:16] <+Pachi3000> Switch Axe is unga to charge extra unga
[2:21:21] <%tank7013> I wish the SwAxe unga skill didn't remove zsd
[2:21:28] <Magick_Man> GS is "GOTCHA B****"
[2:21:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> nice
[2:21:34] <%BubbaRands> yeah Pat lance that ass
[2:21:36] <Lagzlot> Just as long as it's not MH3 barroth. Nothing I know is as op for a beginning monster as MH3 barroth.
[2:21:36] <Magick_Man> Swaxe is Big Unga Big Bunga
[2:21:39] <Blank9> a lot of things are unga when you know what you're doing
[2:21:42] <+Anime_Flux> ...wut
[2:21:42] <+Pachi3000> I can't Swatch without ZSD, it's my baby
[2:21:52] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @Peacefrog7 sent you the link
[2:21:59] <$Cthulos> !uptime
[2:21:59] <@Moobot> @Cthulos I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 22m.
[2:22:02] <%tank7013> You can just stand there with a monster. It would be easy cheese
[2:22:07] <Cosairen> you could also just stand there for free uptime
[2:22:07] <JonnyJug> And you could just hold the monster still while all teammates went hog on it
[2:22:09] <Shwepie> It's because the rider can just stand there and do nothing for almost 30 seconds.
[2:22:12] <DrkJP520> Oh man, remember when you could knock off a mounting pleyer off of a monster?
[2:22:15] <+TestAnon> that was a big problem in 4U
[2:22:17] <%SmiteKnight> What HR are they all at?
[2:22:21] <Cosairen> i kinda miss old mounting
[2:22:23] <Zombrocom> Because then you could just have the monster stand still and have every one just hit it for free
[2:22:28] <Zombrocom> Super boring and cheesy
[2:22:30] <sheepymcsheeperton> Yeah it’ sucked
[2:22:36] <%Agami23> why does pat not reload?

[2:22:41] <JonnyJug> "I'm gonna flash it!"
[2:22:41] <%FacetiousAF> plague is like hr106, paige is 2, pat is 5
[2:22:42] <sfah_tham> thats in a normal mount tho no?

[2:23:15] <Cosairen> shovel boi
[2:23:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Barroth is a cutie
[2:23:16] <%BubbaRands> BARROTH IS THE SHIT

[2:23:28] <%IamGrapes> i had a friend that drew a baby Barroth
[2:23:31] <TheDrown> Time to preorder the Barroth plush
[2:23:34] <OneThousandTomatoes> i really like the desert fight theme
[2:23:44] <Treasure_Vault> How's Paige doing with her blue wirebug attack task?
[2:23:48] <%SmiteKnight> I've been playing longsword for solo and hunting horn for groups.
[2:23:49] <sfah_tham> In lore any hunter who can solo a barroth is an insanely good hunter
[2:23:50] <%Dakuu75> Odogaron was my fave in MHW
[2:23:57] <Profmcstevie> I hope eli talks like this playing solo
[2:23:57] <%TheDullaMAN> Toot toot
[2:24:07] <%SodiumPatrol> @Namillus neeed urgent snek pls

[2:24:34] <+Pachi3000> time to die?
[2:24:34] <+Anime_Flux> perfect timing
[2:24:37] <%dekkitout> Whoever had the call on the second gl switch skill was a damned aint
[2:24:37] <+Pachi3000> oh man
[2:24:37] <Ralfclogs> LUL
[2:24:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> but he still hits like a bulldozer
[2:24:46] <sfah_tham> estus up
[2:24:49] <Treasure_Vault> The biggest lie Pat ever told was making the Monster Hunter lore sound cool.
[2:24:51] <Lagzlot> "He's fair." Except for Tri barroth.
[2:24:52] <Cosairen> im so glad clutch claw is gone

[2:25:10] <DeathByPoke7> LUL
[2:25:11] <CollinsOfBodom> I was wondering where Gief was, unusually quiet
[2:25:12] <Profmcstevie> 3U Jade Barroth at G rank was a HOOT
[2:25:21] <Blank9> the real monster hunter lore is the explanation for every super power like breathing fire being "they eat rocks, shut up"
[2:25:26] <%Sotetsu> Sir! Sir!
[2:25:37] <sfah_tham> two hammers and a gunlance and he wants the tail
[2:25:39] <sfah_tham> yeah ok
[2:25:40] <%FacetiousAF> blast dash go brr psaGib
[2:25:44] <SulfurousAcid> how is lance in rise?
[2:25:45] <+Pachi3000> lol
[2:25:47] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Desire sensor, activated
[2:25:50] <DensityD> an maybe you're a halfwit, who values style over substance!
[2:25:53] <+DizzyGunner> barroth is basically a giant muddy dog
[2:25:56] <+Pachi3000> yeah if you want to cut off a tail, gunlance and two hammers ain't gonna do it
[2:25:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's Greg's first time playing, dontcha know
[2:26:00] <Cosairen> they fart really hard cause they eat everything- congalala lore
[2:26:02] <%Sotetsu> Nice burst
[2:26:08] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I would kill for a good MH tv anthology or book
[2:26:10] <+Pachi3000> no, Rathian
[2:26:10] <%TheDullaMAN> Why not just use Bowgun?
[2:26:11] <DensityD> ACTUAL FIREBLIGHT
[2:26:15] <+Pachi3000> mah queen
[2:26:23] <%BubbaRands> HERS OUR GURL
[2:26:24] <vonmaultke> Maybe because Gunlance has the slowest speedrun of all weapons and terrible DPS Kappa
[2:26:26] <%ChrisPlaysThing> huehuehue
[2:26:26] <+Pachi3000> LUL
[2:26:30] <sfah_tham> ?? she dropped in all tired like
[2:26:35] <SulfurousAcid> give us the fliiiip
[2:26:35] <%YakumoYomi> LUL
[2:26:40] <+AWr00tBear> I think Pat has Blast Dash but Charge shell into Wyrmstake can cut tails quickly
[2:26:42] <%Sotetsu> Do a barrel roll!
[2:26:44] <+Pachi3000> poison flip@
[2:26:52] <Cosairen> i love that you actually get the blight procs from monster finishers
[2:26:54] <commanderapathy> ya gotta weeb that tail off with your katahna
[2:26:56] <%BubbaRands> CLEVER GIRL

[2:27:00] <illtima> Whiffed everything
[2:27:01] <sfah_tham> how
[2:27:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> LUL
[2:27:01] <%Kaask> 5 whiffs
[2:27:01] <+Pachi3000> big whiffage
[2:27:02] <DensityD> poison damage makes it harder to confirm a tail cut
[2:27:04] <SulfurousAcid> LUL
[2:27:04] <JonnyJug> laaapoLul
[2:27:04] <%Agami23> its ok pat
[2:27:06] <%TheDullaMAN> Good tail cut, Pat

[2:27:11] <Blank9> hahaha
[2:27:12] <Darthkitten_Prime> Nice tail cut pat, you did so good on that fight
[2:27:13] <%brisk_dacat> Wiff city
[2:27:13] <sfah_tham> half the hunt was whifs
[2:27:14] <OneThousandTomatoes> i feel sympathy paints pat
[2:27:16] <%YakumoYomi> I would use LS or IG for tailcutting
[2:27:19] <%notsoy> man gunlance is doodoo
[2:27:21] <%RealThiele> brute smarts
[2:27:24] <+Namillus> oh no poor gief
[2:27:24] <%WeLucklessJacks> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[2:27:27] <%Monkeyweed21> You can really tell Pat is a GS main by all the whiffs
[2:27:30] <%brisk_dacat> Whiff in 60seconds
[2:27:34] <+bittahjuri> Hey Pat, how do you like the Sword and Shield?
[2:27:34] <Blank9> IG is best tailcutter
[2:27:34] <%Agami23> she might get a tail from the mission rewards
[2:27:37] <ergulor> just play greatsword
[2:27:37] <+Pachi3000> Gunlance is great, but it is NOT a severing weapon
[2:27:38] <susukouhai> Aww giefy
[2:27:39] <%Sotetsu> Just use your best. psaSun
[2:27:39] <thevoiceofcheese> Show pup!
[2:27:40] <ergulor> who cares
[2:27:43] <Treasure_Vault> no we will always watch this
[2:27:44] <+Namillus> If you want to cut tails, go CB
[2:27:47] <%Ironbuttz> lance is very fun
[2:27:48] <sfah_tham> true
[2:27:48] <%baka_sugoi> psaBig sword MAINS
[2:27:49] <+antpantz> lance p fun in this game
[2:27:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> ive been having a lot of fun with swaxe in rise
[2:27:53] <Cosairen> gs is all whiffing till you get that one big ass hit
[2:27:53] <+Namillus> axe mode vertical coverage really helps
[2:27:55] <Cosairen> its great
[2:27:56] <Treasure_Vault> Play Greatsword, show us your cool big dick
[2:27:57] <%Axellogic> Eli have you gotten the Lance thrust dash yet? Its super strong
[2:27:59] <DensityD> tremendous energy in this trio, who cares about hunt performance
[2:28:04] <JonnyJug> Lance can cut
[2:28:04] <%notsoy> GS is more or less the signature weapon of the series, no?
[2:28:12] <DensityD> carve it
[2:28:13] <SulfurousAcid> I've decided to use swaxe first in rise
[2:28:16] <+UbiquitousLost> Pray for it in the rewards
[2:28:17] <+Pachi3000> Greatsword, Switch Axe, Twin Blades, Long Sword
[2:28:19] <sheepymcsheeperton> Spiral dash Lance is fun and strong, but it’s a super weird Lance play style
[2:28:19] <Cosairen> longsword is now
[2:28:22] <bathesinrust> "OK,thank you about the baby"
[2:28:22] <sfah_tham> tail is part of the hunt always
[2:28:27] <Daemyx> capture and quest rewards can get you tails
[2:28:32] <sfah_tham> an objective all on its own
[2:28:36] <%Sotetsu> The baby
[2:28:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> @notsoy for the most part yes but for rise its ls because japan
[2:28:39] <+Pachi3000> Crap Ace
[2:28:44] <%YakumoYomi> RF Slicing shot it my tail-cutter of choice
[2:28:44] <+Anime_Flux> the Crapface
[2:28:52] <sheepymcsheeperton> Crap ace
[2:28:52] <EASrake> cara pachay
[2:28:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> crapiss
[2:28:53] <%GinAndRoses> crap face hammer
[2:28:53] <+Namillus> Tail cutting is just generally helpful
[2:28:57] <Lagzlot> No, "crap-ace" is a different brute wyvern.
[2:28:58] <+ChocolateMoofin> Harbulary batteries!
[2:28:59] <%Agami23> greatsword seems great if you know how to use it
[2:28:59] <%TamsynRRD> Crap Ass

[2:29:19] <%FacetiousAF> chat does rise have weapon layers?
[2:29:21] <%RetroCop87> isn't crap face a Batman villain?
[2:29:22] <+Pachi3000> There's no way she can

[2:29:48] <%SmiteKnight> Lemme think about it cwapface.
[2:29:49] <sfah_tham> carpaccio?
[2:29:51] <+Pachi3000> There is
[2:29:52] <%FacetiousAF> hammer build
[2:29:56] <+Pachi3000> It's like just made of wood
[2:29:57] <%dekkitout> What helmet is bludgeon, the hog one?
[2:29:59] <%RealThiele> armoire
[2:30:02] <DensityD> you love it
[2:30:17] <+Pachi3000> Barroth stuff is good defense, low affinity
[2:30:20] <sfah_tham> ....no cutscene for making weapons
[2:30:28] <sfah_tham> thats cool
[2:30:34] <Cosairen> thank god
[2:30:38] <DensityD> I also miss the cutscene for making armor or weapons
[2:30:41] <+Pachi3000> You're blue now
[2:30:42] <+ChocolateMoofin> Strong is big. Big is strong.
[2:30:52] <Lagzlot> I usually avoid barroth weapons  because of their negative affinity and low sharpness but that's because I usually use weapons that are slicey and/or pokey.
[2:30:53] <+Pachi3000> bone piles
[2:30:58] <%octotasty> Bonepiles in the Shrine
[2:30:58] <EASrake> in da desert
[2:30:59] <+Pachi3000> in the desert I think
[2:30:59] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Sandy Plains Bone Piles
[2:31:00] <%Animatic_> eroded skeleton's in the sandy plains
[2:31:02] <+Pachi3000> yep
[2:31:03] <zodiark26> @FacetiousAF only ramp-up weapons can be "layered"
[2:31:04] <DensityD> sandy plains
[2:31:13] <%RealThiele> erotic skeletons
[2:31:17] <DrkJP520> barroth armor looks ridiculous
[2:31:27] <%W1nterTitan> poor gief
[2:31:28] <+Pachi3000> Oh man that is a goofy ass blade
[2:31:29] <DeathByPoke7> Barroth set always looked like a chess piece to me
[2:31:38] <Lagzlot> Barroth armor: I AM GROOT.
[2:31:39] <sfah_tham> chestpiece could really do with a  makeover

[2:32:19] <%tank7013> Get him a coloring book
[2:32:24] <Profmcstevie> He's a puzzle god, and a tank of a dog

[2:35:49] <+Pachi3000> Paige's does too
[2:36:02] <%RetroCop87> This looks like a good spot to find some ingredients!
[2:36:08] <Aussie_Manny> "Yoink!" is way better.
[2:36:12] <+Pachi3000> that's for everyone
[2:36:19] <+Pachi3000> It's an item you have to find
[2:36:24] <DaKnightWarrior> voice 9 is the best.
[2:37:01] <Aussie_Manny> 🦖 khadBonk
[2:37:11] <+Pachi3000> Barroth is also a good boy
[2:37:21] <%BubbaRands> AWWW HE BIG YAWN
[2:37:23] <TheDrown> Oooh yeah brother we're gonna be puttin the avalanche of pain on this here monstar oh ye lytSHADES
[2:37:41] <JonnyJug> You got a lucky twig
[2:37:42] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Whatever you say, Paige
[2:37:45] <%BubbaRands> Monster Hunter :)
[2:37:47] <+Vigonept> the bird had gold and diablos horns
[2:37:52] <+aBoner89> uh oh stinky
[2:37:56] <+Pachi3000> You're bashing him with his OWN bones
[2:37:56] <%dekkitout> It must be doo doo
[2:37:57] <+Pachi3000> So rude
[2:38:16] <%RetroCop87> Pat with the whiffs
[2:38:23] <+Pachi3000> There's a counter
[2:38:27] <+Pachi3000> And a charge forward
[2:38:28] <+SuichiTanaka> The counter will fill all your phials
[2:38:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> One's a counter, one's a charge forward
[2:38:42] <%TerpanderLux> g u a r d p o i n t s
[2:38:46] <%Sotetsu> Thanks for playing charge blade!
[2:38:50] <sfah_tham> Paige is somewhere in the house, denied her spaghett and the loving affection of dog
[2:38:55] <%dekkitout> Y pulls you in and morphs, B is block to fill phial on successful block
[2:38:55] <Shwepie> One is defend for max vials.
[2:38:55] <yukichocomilk> once you learn it you never forget though
[2:38:56] <%Agami23> there have been a few changes to charge blade since then, but nothing too confusing
[2:38:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> once you learn it once its fine
[2:39:03] <Blank9> gotta attack and charge a sword and charge a shield and charge a sword and spent an axe
[2:39:03] <+Pachi3000> If you connect with the counter your phials get filled and you can link into an elemental roundslash or the big pizza cutter
[2:39:12] <Sakhasa> Took my time learning the CB, now I have a PhD and seven published academic papers
[2:39:18] <%Kaask> while it may be the "most complicated" of the weapons, it's by no means difficult to learn or use.
[2:39:28] <%TheDullaMAN> Flippies
[2:39:40] <Raven_In_A_Tree> Axe mode CB is super fun but sword mode fuckin SUCKKKSSS
[2:39:51] <thesoldierofjoy> the block wirebug fills phials to full immediately
[2:39:52] <yukichocomilk> the L2 + circle parry is bonkers
[2:39:53] <sheepymcsheeperton> Uhm, ACTUALLY, she’s a wyvern
[2:39:56] <+SinisterBroccoli> why was plague saying hell yeah hot?
[2:40:04] <dont_call_me_steve> pat running Evade Extender at all? also hello
[2:40:08] <simplyvince15> @Kaask thats a great way to describe the weapon. Once you learn the flow its easy to play
[2:40:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, Charge Blade was the weapon I learned most easily when I was a noobie, it's not super hard to learn
[2:40:37] <+Pachi3000> tuckered out
[2:40:55] <zodiark26> i think someone's doggo has a para weap
[2:41:00] <+AWr00tBear> CB wire bug block makes the weapon very Unga Bunga
[2:41:09] <+Pachi3000> dirty boy
[2:41:19] <%BubbaRands> NICE TIMING
[2:41:23] <%Sotetsu> Is friendly fire on if your share any weapon with someone else?
[2:41:26] <SwindlerOfProgress> @zodiark26 Yeah, Plague said his dog has the jelly weapon, which does para
[2:41:30] <TurtlesAndTentacles> SWAXE
[2:41:35] <%ChrisPlaysThing> # or nothing
[2:41:39] <%ChrisPlaysThing> 3
[2:41:41] <sfah_tham> not quite friendly fire
[2:41:43] <$Cthulos> So why didn’t Pat cheat himself up to max rank like he did in World PC?
[2:41:47] <sfah_tham> just a flinch
[2:42:14] <sfah_tham> ooo
[2:42:16] <koffeemancer> @PatStaresAt you can use amped elemental discharge of the wire bug counter btw
[2:42:19] <+Vigonept> rad
[2:42:19] <SwindlerOfProgress> @Sotetsu Nah, I think he just means that since they're both using hammer, they're both near the head and hammer has quite a few moves that knock your allies around
[2:42:24] <%Monkeyweed21> is the axe mode buff still in or did they remove that in rise
[2:42:24] <%YakumoYomi> LUL
[2:42:25] <%cooldude69xx> good block pat!
[2:42:26] <dont_call_me_steve> tanked that shit like a champ
[2:42:27] <DrkJP520> pat fighting barroth, eli and paige looking at birds
[2:42:55] <+BootyFriend> Guardpoint his ass
[2:43:31] <sfah_tham> thats why you stun it harder eli
[2:43:33] <stormhawk9891> @Monkeyweed21 Still in but you have to give up sword buff if you want to use it
[2:43:34] <simplyvince15> @Monkeyweed21 Yeah its in here, but it works a little differently. You have to hold the attack button on hit to get the multihits
[2:43:36] <%BubbaRands> BIG BOI DAMAGE
[2:43:36] <sfah_tham> go ham-mer

[2:43:50] <%Blackmage9999> Blackmage9999 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[2:43:53] <%TamsynRRD> @Monkeyweed21 There is an axe buff.  Also, one of the switch skills makes the axehead spin like a buzzsaw until the phials drain
[2:43:58] <Lagzlot> Benny Hill monster moments are one big reason that lockon isn't really a thing in this series.
[2:44:01] <SwindlerOfProgress> Very good mount message, Plague
[2:44:09] <+Vigonept> WIFF
[2:44:11] <TheeRabbi> Pat using half of Chuck Noland's raft as a shield
[2:44:15] <MuFuzzy649> pat really wants that tail
[2:44:15] <%dont_call_me_steve> here it comes
[2:44:19] <+Pachi3000> rawr
[2:44:20] <xhodocto385> hiya pat
[2:44:29] <sfah_tham> tail is want
[2:44:31] <+Pachi3000> he going to the mud
[2:44:34] <ZweihanderSteve> BUT HE IS
[2:44:36] <%Sotetsu> Pat's chasing tail.
[2:44:36] <Lagzlot> Did Pat just Passage Of Arms that barroth?
[2:44:38] <%RealThiele> get that Barrussy
[2:44:39] <TurtlesAndTentacles> you're killing it Eli
[2:44:43] <sfah_tham> finally
[2:44:52] <xhodocto385> it's the japanese styled monhun game PogChamp and i see the barroth
[2:44:57] <DensityD> je suis monte
[2:44:58] <+Pachi3000> it does
[2:45:01] <Darthkitten_Prime> It's super annoying with switch axe too, it's why I hate fighting tigrex in world. Thankfully the wirebug skills help me catch up to the monster
[2:45:08] <sfah_tham> is they go easy on barroth you migth get your chance
[2:45:12] <%dekkitout> Gunlance aint the way for tail cuts brudda
[2:45:14] <EASrake> all damage contributes to damaging the tail. It just needs cutting damage to finish cutting it
[2:45:15] <stormhawk9891> I thought GL used piercing damage
[2:45:20] <xhodocto385> those mud balls look gross
[2:45:21] <%dont_call_me_steve> gunlance is so much fun in this game, you get a counter that sharpens
[2:45:35] <Shwepie> Do blunt weapons contribute to cutting tails off just can't actually finish?
[2:45:40] <VallerinTerra> You don't need all slashing to break a tail, just the last hit has to be
[2:45:47] <%dekkitout> @dont_call_me_steve Connecting that feels like sex
[2:45:51] <sfah_tham> yes but they dont do the final cut
[2:45:52] <%dont_call_me_steve> @shwepie yup
[2:46:25] <%dont_call_me_steve> @dekkitout the follow up into fast wyrmstake is psaDabb psaDabb psaDabb
[2:46:29] <%BubbaRands> she's all tuckered out
[2:46:33] <sfah_tham> milk?@
[2:46:36] <%Agami23> greatsword and switchaxe would be good for cutting the tail through the health increase
[2:46:38] <EASrake> @stormhawk9891 Gunlance does slashing damage. Its shelling attack is the same damage type as barrel bombs
[2:46:46] <xhodocto385> milk to what? monkaS
[2:46:48] <%YakumoYomi> Why milk? I've heard of warm water...but milk?
[2:46:57] <+Pachi3000> he's limpin
[2:47:00] <%dekkitout> Time to break out the long sword for boneless tails?
[2:47:01] <+Vigonept> you were too close?
[2:47:03] <%Sotetsu> psaGib otzSleep1
[2:47:06] <sfah_tham> monster runs like a titan
[2:47:07] <+cursedwithadhd> more goblins
[2:47:08] <karl_rex> ugh just had a turbo tax ad about crypto
[2:47:19] <KnifeyMcEdge> what a pussa
[2:47:24] <zzNamttamzz> You had one job Greg NotLikeThis
[2:47:25] <+Pachi3000> nope, he's just muddin
[2:47:25] <%GinAndRoses> maim the monsters
[2:47:28] <xhodocto385> uh oh crypto is now omnipresent
[2:47:50] <Profmcstevie> Always beat ass
[2:47:55] <%Fooguwu> so no head?
[2:47:58] <sfah_tham> welp
[2:48:01] <+Pachi3000> hammer can't cut off tails since they don't do slashing damage
[2:48:02] <Darthkitten_Prime> Wait, doesn't he sleep under the mud anyways? Wouldn't it be impossible to hit the tail while he's sleeping?
[2:48:05] <xhodocto385> he rollin in the muddy water until his last breath
[2:48:06] <Cosairen> apa
[2:48:09] <%Agami23> so greatsword?
[2:48:14] <%TheDullaMAN> You...did it.
[2:48:15] <KnifeyMcEdge> Plague gettin in there
[2:48:19] <xhodocto385> GG
[2:48:20] <JonnyJug> Show off your GS tailcutting abilities
[2:48:21] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Blunt weapons CAN damage the tail.... Slashing is just needed to SEVER it once it's taken enough.... Also monsters in Rise wont go to sleep if you follow too closely I think
[2:48:22] <sfah_tham> lance?
[2:48:24] <%Sotetsu> There will always be more tail
[2:48:26] <T_Sasquatch> I had to kill barroth so much for my switch axe in mhw NotLikeThis
[2:48:37] <%FacetiousAF> cap for tail?
[2:49:01] <Profmcstevie> With Eli? Oh baby the ruby weapon power hour with a farmer assist
[2:49:03] <+SuichiTanaka> Tails can be in the capture rewards
[2:49:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Actually yeah, capture might have a better rate'
[2:49:17] <%TheDullaMAN> Pity drop
[2:49:21] <%dont_call_me_steve> Eli you don't need to do the combo anymore for full burst just blast dash and it's free
[2:49:24] <+Pachi3000> they're different for sure
[2:49:26] <%FacetiousAF> good enough
[2:49:28] <+AWr00tBear> Pat need GS
[2:49:40] <sfah_tham> sometimes you just get 4 tails in rewards
[2:49:44] <sfah_tham> or carves even
[2:49:46] <Darthkitten_Prime> Switch Axe and Greatsword are great at cutting tails
[2:50:00] <%Anime_Flux> Bone Chonker
[2:50:03] <%FacetiousAF> chonky
[2:50:04] <JonnyJug> Greg Groot
[2:50:11] <+Pachi3000> Feels so good to sever the tail with a ZSD
[2:50:20] <%captain_thickthighs> looks like walking rook
[2:50:28] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Tetranadon armor also has a delightfully goofy look to it, but it's more a Gunner armor
[2:50:29] <sfah_tham> SnS too no?
[2:50:30] <+Pachi3000> Big Fin are from Delex
[2:50:34] <+TestAnon> delex
[2:50:35] <Darthkitten_Prime> Those are from the sandfish in the desert
[2:50:36] <TrollKing96> When are we gonna get an owlbear?
[2:50:36] <%TerpanderLux> the sandfish maybe?
[2:50:39] <+Pachi3000> The fish enemy in the Sandy Plains
[2:50:40] <+Jaromero435> comes from the monsters swiming in the sand
[2:50:40] <Darthkitten_Prime> Yeah Delex
[2:50:42] <BepBepAmShep> the sand sharks have them
[2:50:43] <T_Sasquatch> Feels so good to zsd in general LUL
[2:50:43] <%octotasty> Big Fins are from the sand fish in the desert
[2:50:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> sand fish
[2:50:46] <%FacetiousAF> sandfish, north end of the desert
[2:50:47] <%TheDullaMAN> Sand fish
[2:50:48] <diontmack> those are from delex
[2:50:53] <susukouhai> Delex fish
[2:50:56] <%GinAndRoses> yuuuup
[2:50:57] <%TerpanderLux> pee right back
[2:50:58] <sheepysenka> pee right back
[2:51:00] <%octotasty> Pee Right Back
[2:51:04] <Vermillion129> It’s from delex small monstee
[2:51:09] <Treasure_Vault> prb
[2:51:15] <%GinAndRoses> psaBig fin
[2:51:15] <thesoldierofjoy> They come from Delex, the sand fish
[2:51:22] <+Pachi3000> They can be kinda obnoxious to kill because they jump around
[2:51:22] <%Sotetsu> psaGiefstare Pee
[2:51:35] <Darthkitten_Prime> The Delex are a lot easier to kill if you use your dog to chase them down
[2:51:42] <sfah_tham> no egg quests in rise?
[2:51:43] <%TerpanderLux> pipi
[2:51:48] <OneThousandTomatoes> are they weak to sonic bombs?
[2:52:11] <+SuichiTanaka> Yeah, a sonic bomb will make them all pop out
[2:52:14] <+Pachi3000> rise has egg quests
[2:52:14] <OneThousandTomatoes> @sfah_tham there are
[2:52:16] <zodiark26> sonic bombs will also stun and pop the delex out of the sand
[2:52:22] <%baka_sugoi> psaDabb psaDabb psaDabb
[2:52:26] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @sfah_tham there are, just not as many I think
[2:52:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> but you can use wirebugs while carrying eggs
[2:52:32] <susukouhai> And it makes them flop around
[2:53:12] <+SuichiTanaka> The egg deliveries are annoying because the other camps don't have boxes. You always need to deliver them to primary spawn
[2:53:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Wirebugs are very useful for eggs indeed
[2:53:31] <sfah_tham> cant believe they give you a kulu helmet at the end of the base world where they dont give out egg quests
[2:53:37] <sfah_tham> just lugging canon balls
[2:54:07] <xhodocto385> ResidentSleeper
[2:54:16] <zodiark26> i hope they bring back sootstone deliveries
[2:54:19] <%bustawof> bustawof subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[2:54:46] <Mattais88> Apex hunts are a pain in the ass
[2:55:31] <sfah_tham> is it me or is rise not as ''gripping'' as world?
[2:55:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Eh, I think Rise is pretty gripping, personally
[2:56:16] <yukichocomilk> @sfah_tham it's you
[2:56:43] <Mattais88> I'm at 250 hours on switch, so I think I'm pretty gripped
[2:56:59] <+Pachi3000> I don't know what you mean by "gripping" but I have over 100 hours in this game across both versions
[2:57:02] <+Pachi3000> so,
[2:57:19] <+SuichiTanaka> They're just different games. Rise is easier to get into and starts faster. World has more emphasis on the level.
[2:57:25] <automatom125> I think Rise is hella fun, but I think Rise feels more arcadey than world
[2:57:29] <Sakhasa> I have to set boundaries for myself, otherwise I just would be playing rise 24/7
[2:57:31] <sfah_tham> mmm
[2:57:52] <automatom125> the camera and movement in World is lower and slower, so monsters feel more emposing
[2:58:01] <Cosairen> rise def feels more akin to classic mh than world did
[2:58:06] <Verdantree> Rise is definitely a return to the 'traditional' monster hunter formula with the QoL from world
[2:58:09] <xhodocto385> this is a cliche question, but why humans are the real monsters in MH?
[2:58:10] <sfah_tham> i think arcadey the feeling i got too
[2:58:23] <+Shoosler> @sfah_tham I know what you mean. it's because rise feels lower budget compared to world.
[2:58:36] <Cosairen> @xhodocto385 super strength
[2:58:46] <xhodocto385> they seem to like hunting too much instead of balancing the ecosystem from those invasive species
[2:58:50] <automatom125> one of the big things is movement with the wire bugs and riding the dogs
[2:58:58] <sfah_tham> would be higher budget because its a different engine
[2:59:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> World did have the whole focus on ecology too, which made it feel real immersive
[2:59:06] <automatom125> in world you just gotta chase on foot after monsters which makes things more urgent
[2:59:17] <+Shoosler> like the dango vs. elaborant food porn in world it's a cost cutting method
[2:59:30] <Colombian_Escobar> This is an awesome BRB screen
[2:59:38] <Cosairen> world was great till i had to have 5 minutes of downtime to get to where the monster went
[2:59:40] <sfah_tham> ikr
[3:00:03] <xhodocto385> i like MHW but the soundtrack felt like a hit or miss
[3:00:08] <Sakhasa> god I miss the food porn of world, even tho I do like the dangos
[3:00:16] <+SuichiTanaka> I would have given up some of the elaborate environments and food from World, to have more weapon variety. The weapon visuals in World were piss poor
[3:00:20] <%KineticZen> Hey Greg
[3:00:24] <%YakumoYomi> I was alright with the chasing in World, but fuck deco grinding
[3:00:29] <%cooldude69xx> HAHA

[3:00:31] <Coystick> PLAIGE THE UNHOLY
[3:00:31] <yukichocomilk> world did have a lot more story which i guess felt more immersive but the story sucked so.. i kinda prefer this way

[3:01:03] <kill_lazaro> good thing tech issues earlier were fixed
[3:01:05] <+Shoosler> @xhodocto385 the best mod I have on world replaces the soundtrack with songs from FFXV, FFVIIR, nier automata etc. Battles felt so much more epic thanks to the music

[3:11:42] <Lagzlot> I called mine "dogmobile."
[3:11:52] <%baka_sugoi> gief should of been Pizza
[3:11:53] <Treasure_Vault> If Pat goes back to the hunting horn, we can call him Greg of Pipes
[3:11:55] <xhodocto385> Khezu is more like a unholy demon than a traditional monster
[3:11:57] <EynoStiles> i like how some monster are just sliding across the terrain. lol
[3:12:03] <%RetroCop87> I have a toy sized dauchsand named Butch
[3:12:03] <Cosairen> i just called mine baseball

[3:13:27] <xhodocto385> why does Khezu have lips, now that is wrong
[3:13:28] <fatalDestiny> @fatalDestiny I can't rename them, that'd be admitting defeat.
[3:13:35] <sheepysenka> I wonder if Paige still has music turned down low
[3:13:39] <%hewlettfan96> That Dog needs  attention

[3:13:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Truly the perfect weapon
[3:13:50] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Shout out to Plague for being a fellow Lance main
[3:13:51] <sheepysenka> I bet she can't even hear Khezu's theme
[3:13:54] <%RetroCop87> I know the most common joke is that he's a giant dick, but he looks more like a mass produced Eva unit to me
