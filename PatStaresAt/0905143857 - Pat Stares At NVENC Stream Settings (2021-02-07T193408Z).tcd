[0:00:02] <sweetestbeefs> ES6 will come out when todd coward dies
[0:00:04] <%shurtal> Doin' Namazu beast tribe quests and i just really like his whiskers
[0:00:18] <%WhereIsWill> nvenc (final)
[0:00:41] <%SomeSageAdvice> that'd be interesting
[0:00:46] <+Sendrak70> reloaded, no 1080 available :(
[0:00:49] <%AyotoCorp> Might as well for your own purposes if anything
[0:00:50] <%Arweynn> I'm not seeing 1080 source as an option on twitch atm
[0:00:50] <jamox1> There‚Äôs like 6 vods so far rn I think
[0:00:52] <sweetestbeefs> looks so much better holy shit
[0:00:54] <%AyotoCorp> Also I still only see 720
[0:00:59] <Tampaoster> But it still stutters
[0:01:01] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> still 720p
[0:01:01] <+Gamblor69> No 1080 for me
[0:01:01] <%SomeSageAdvice> wow this looks really smooth and i can see a bunch of the detail
[0:01:02] <jamox1> That‚Äôs smooth
[0:01:06] <+Sendrak70> There we go, 4 reloads did the trick
[0:01:08] <Jetsfantasy> Reloaded after you came live, 1080P source is up
[0:01:09] <+Midashu> always seems to take 5 minutes from start of stream for it to get back to 1080p60
[0:01:15] <%Arweynn> this time it's smooth as butter though
[0:01:18] <+Ominnous> bitrate: killl meeeeeeeeee
[0:01:25] <+Gamblor69> Now ive got 1080
[0:01:27] <%SomeSageAdvice> like its a little blurry but like i can tell what stuff is now
[0:01:30] <%Arweynn> looks like shit in 720 with artifactin though
[0:01:36] <%AyotoCorp> Bit of stutter just then but much better
[0:01:39] <sweetestbeefs> theres no 1080p option though pat
[0:01:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> yeah that mountain pan was rough
[0:01:54] <%its_just_coach> refresh for 1080
[0:01:59] <+Sendrak70> @sweetestbeefs Reload, it will pop up. Its there
[0:02:01] <sweetestbeefs> it looks better overall
[0:02:03] <jamox1> I can‚Äôt tell if that was stutter or weird camera
[0:02:05] <%Ne1son> @sweetestbeefs need to refresh multiple times
[0:02:10] <TurtlesAndTentacles> No Pat Face?
[0:02:11] <%Arweynn> ok NOW I reload and 1080 is in the options
[0:02:12] <%SomeSageAdvice> ahhh for some reason it started lagging when it was crossing the ocean
[0:02:14] <+shry7> some stutter yeah
[0:02:17] <+Sovspot> you should stop being a pussy and give this game another shot.
[0:02:19] <%AyotoCorp> It seems like it drops when the camera rotates
[0:02:25] <%Livelinne> Livelinne subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 9 month streak! 
[0:02:26] <%AyotoCorp> If the camera moves in a straight line it's fine
[0:02:29] <Jetsfantasy> Source looked good, but yeah stutters were rough
[0:02:31] <%LegendGHT> total warhammer?
[0:02:44] <sweetestbeefs> okay yeah just had to refresh lol
[0:02:46] <sweetestbeefs> thanks chat
[0:02:52] <%SomeSageAdvice> he already has a schedule set lol @Sovspot
[0:02:56] <jamox1> üëç
[0:02:58] <knotsundownsyndrome> @PatStaresAt hope your day's been good fella
[0:03:05] <+Midashu> NVENC overall does a better job at lower cost. From my understanding you'd need a beefier CPU and higher image quality encoding settings to get better x264 quality.
[0:03:07] <%Treuan> So far so good
[0:03:17] <%SomeSageAdvice> this is a game that if he does go back to, it would have to be during a lull in videogames coming out
[0:03:25] <%AyotoCorp> I can make out individual units, so it's a huge step up
[0:03:26] <%TrafficCohen> So Pat, who do you like between Slaanesh and Nurgle? Are you a weird creepy sex pest or a Slaanesh fan?
[0:03:28] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Wow
[0:03:33] <%Arweynn> yeah this looks the best by far so far
[0:03:38] <%LegendGHT> gatdamn your computer does good
[0:03:42] <%baka_sugoi> oWo
[0:03:46] <Jetsfantasy> Do you have x265 support or does twitch not support that
[0:03:46] <jamox1> Yeah this looks a lot better
[0:03:49] <%SomeSageAdvice> huh the pan there didnt drop below 60
[0:03:49] <+cgreene64> what is this game?
[0:03:50] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Oh wow
