[0:08:11] <%legendfather_of_giants> @cartakus if you're in free trial, you'ren not allowed to queue when the world is full,  so you can't play at all until it calms down
[0:08:16] <+Urgotfantasy> Controller wiggle to the rescue
[0:08:16] <%watts121> @wmeldrum granted he would be playing EW either way. I've played an unhealthy amount and finally finished MSQ this morning.

[0:09:08] <%KineticZen> Clearly he's been staring at the queue for the podcast's duraton
[0:09:09] <%strugglepunk2> strugglepunk2 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months, currently on a 36 month streak! Heya Pat, just finished the MSQ last night/this morning. Endwalker's great, and I'm really excited to be able to watch you go through it while I start to prep for EX and Raid.
[0:09:16] <+Akizea> this expac is nothing short of immaculate
[0:09:24] <Zeppelee> I was able to get to this ONE dungeon the other night, and I immediately began to cry like a little bitch once the vocals kicked in the BGM.
[0:09:26] <MikeyxStyles> Free Trial players like myself have to wait til about midnight-1 am to play
[0:09:33] <%Kevlar_Caviar> hey remember yesterday when pat was fighting a big MUV-LUV lookin ass monster and its ass turned out to be a face? because i sure do
[0:10:11] <+brightman42> he's not in queue he logged in early in the morning and has just been wiggling the controller every 5 minutes since
[0:10:19] <~PatStaresAt> yup
[0:10:26] <TioXyco> @Kevlar_Caviar that enemy sure talks outta its ass
[0:10:35] <Psyramics> nice 2002 dropped my queue by a thousand
[0:10:56] <%zyberion626> I think the queues are somehow even worse today
[0:11:07] <+tr1ps_ax1om> it just dumped me. yourre welcome
[0:11:07] <%Alazull> I love the fact that all these FF10 summons are getting in
[0:11:14] <KnivesEve> where did pat leave off yesterday? what quest lvl?
[0:11:18] <+johnny_scissors> The music in zone 4 I think it was was rad
[0:11:19] <+brandonsbetow> eh, que is average honestly
[0:11:23] <KatabolicRage> that feel when I'm a britbong and got on when the queu was like, 300 and have never had any problems
[0:11:25] <Zeppelee> @zyberion626 I couldn't get in at all today.
[0:11:32] <thecrazyestminer> What level is pat?
[0:11:33] <TioXyco> but Magus Sisters was FF4 before it was FF10
[0:11:38] <%legendfather_of_giants> @zyberion626 nah i guarantee Sat/Sun was worse, it logged in later but got almost the same queue number
[0:11:39] <+johnny_scissors> Also the tank Drip from the questing gear is out of control
[0:11:40] <%JoshManVGH> @psyramics "Blessed 2002, strike down my enemies that login time might be bolstered"
[0:11:41] <%KineticZen> Queue was half an hour when I got home, not bad
[0:11:58] <ForlornHunter> Ya’ll see that Grub Hub FFxiv pizza emote promotion?
[0:12:11] <+tr1ps_ax1om> yeah lol
[0:12:11] <Ids560> Are we gonna see the tank role quests on stream?
[0:12:15] <%Valask> why do people take days off to play on launch day? surely it's a subpar experience that way
[0:12:15] <Blank9> took me an hour to log in starting at 3pm central

[0:29:43] <Calamity2007> Why is this music fitting
[0:29:45] <%VictorVonLouche> People should STOP giving impressions of endwalker, else you are going to raise expectations and RUIN IT for others.
[0:29:46] <Zeppelee> Where is Elmo?
[0:29:51] <%RealThiele> and then he gets logged out

[0:31:58] <%Grustamar> @legendfather_of_giants I've done no crafting at all yet, wondering if it's something I should do much later or if it matters when I start
[0:31:58] <%Divryne> Sharlyan has a bunch of Undertale Home vibes.
[0:32:01] <+Shoosler> the music is good but weak compared to shadowbringers music
[0:32:02] <Reanimator83> It's super relaxing SeemsGood
[0:32:05] <@QueequegTheater> It's very pointy
[0:32:07] <%RealThiele> Soken earns his paycheck
[0:32:16] <Zeppelee> DRG gear is amazing.

[0:35:13] <%THATGUY_789> all I here is Rats at Hand
[0:35:20] <gaelic_otaku> This music slaps
[0:35:21] <%VictorVonLouche> Zodiark just dies out of nowhere lol
[0:35:29] <%JokerNewby> You have coffers that are better
[0:35:30] <dan_g_v> well, he is the one who lies, no?
[0:35:31] <%SinnerEbru> is ff14 better on m+k or controller?
[0:35:32] <+ALazo> boxes?
[0:35:35] <dan_g_v> what did you expect?
[0:35:36] <+blastazoid00> I cant believe zodiark was such a bitch
[0:35:37] <%Birdigalore> Check your coffers
[0:35:43] <VioletRosefall> I started replacing the cryptlurker gear until level 87-ish
[0:35:48] <MeImoth> I got some from the dungeon thats better then the 530
[0:35:59] <+tr1ps_ax1om> why save them?
[0:36:11] <$realm_forge> Loving this pillar men ambience
[0:36:12] <dan_g_v> so, how does the bunny boys look with 2b's thong?
[0:36:16] <%legendfather_of_giants> the 84 and up coffers are better than augmented cryptlurker @PatStaresAt
[0:36:22] <%JoshManVGH> you're gonna omnicraft
[0:36:24] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah
[0:36:30] <%JokerNewby> yes
[0:36:31] <%legendfather_of_giants> not quite
[0:36:35] <TioXyco> weapon will carry you to 86
[0:36:38] <Sydin18> The scariest thing to see during the end times...a giraffe
[0:36:38] <VioletRosefall> Bozja relic lasts till 88 or so
[0:36:38] <+blastazoid00> no
[0:36:39] <%chiluzza> its not until 86
[0:36:41] <%legendfather_of_giants> 2 IL lower than relic
[0:37:03] <%legendfather_of_giants> btw this set is pretty nice too
[0:37:06] <%JokerNewby> oh how I love the skallic set
[0:37:07] <%Monkeyweed21> relic will last until 87 dungeon
[0:37:17] <+tr1ps_ax1om> lol
[0:37:26] <%JoshManVGH> Can confirm, 86 better than cryptlurker
[0:37:27] <%shurtal> you didn't put the gloves on
[0:37:29] <%SinnerEbru> the hat looks wack but its fine
[0:37:29] <TioXyco> skallic gear mode is nice
[0:37:30] <%MidnightBurst12> perfect
[0:37:31] <gespenst25> you look like you're done up as a present.
[0:37:38] <%JohnAtDawn> LOOK AT THAT BLUE
[0:37:42] <%kid_flashionable> Ooh that looks nice!
[0:37:46] <%Cactuskris> yeah they recolored a lot of gear
[0:37:47] <%Delenay> not bad
[0:37:48] <Zeif00> yea, but darker
[0:37:50] <%AnIcedCoffee> It's skallic but with better dye patterns
[0:37:51] <%legendfather_of_giants> purple
[0:37:58] <heartlesshealer> hooray for dyes
[0:38:01] <gaelic_otaku> I think the red boots make it clash too much
[0:38:07] <Sydin18> I also use a hella ton of wine red dye lol
[0:38:07] <%Eaglestrike117> what were the gloves on your glam by the way?
[0:38:11] <+Havictos> music's going hard huh?
[0:38:22] <TioXyco> thank god this gear dyes better than skallic, because the way that dyed was ass
[0:38:25] <Zeppelee> DMC2 Dante much?
[0:38:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> at least it isn't the ugly purple
[0:38:30] <%legendfather_of_giants> either the 84 or 86 weapons are just grayscale Scaeven as well @PatStaresAt
[0:38:39] <+REDtheBEAST> SeemsGood
[0:38:45] <heartlesshealer> the clashing is probably why Pat was checking if he had black dye on him
[0:38:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> also why are you a rabbit
[0:38:49] <%JokerNewby> Not having to grind for that set anymore is great
[0:38:57] <%livlinn> kyoryuSHOOK kyoryuSHOOK kyoryuSHOOK
[0:39:12] <%JokerNewby> oh me too

[0:45:04] <SaltyAzteca> Dont get spooked out

[0:45:32] <%Nekros4442> JUST DONT LET IT SET IN
[0:45:44] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt It's a fighting chance versus no chance at all
[0:45:45] <engineboi> Neither did ever figure out the cause tho
[0:45:45] <dan_g_v> survuve the first wave

[0:48:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Makes your bun look like Vincet
[0:48:11] <heartlesshealer> so that's why gotta have stylish goggles in the game
[0:48:11] <karl_rex> Au Ra horns
[0:48:12] <+razielhex> just want a cowboy hat with two holes for the ears to poke through in the brim
[0:48:17] <%Nekros4442> I have horns gong back as an Au Ra
[0:48:18] <%Bt_Robot> Didn't you wear a beret forever?
[0:48:23] <heartlesshealer> more full hats would distract from the ears
[0:48:25] <Mildly_Eccentric> the slutty little hat
[0:49:14] <+Vampireinarm> yo thats spooky, are the screams the monsters or the people dying?
[0:49:15] <%RealThiele> settle down or youll kill us all
[0:49:34] <karl_rex> Hundreds
[0:49:37] <$StrawberryPantsu> Ye.
[0:49:38] <Sydin18> /shrug
[0:49:39] <+encouraging_voice> I'd believe it
[0:49:39] <+Vampireinarm> yeh
[0:49:40] <bloopmainbtw> yeah
[0:49:40] <TioXyco> probably
[0:49:40] <%Nekros4442> Yes
[0:49:40] <%Alazull> Not all
[0:49:41] <MKII> they GOT THIS
[0:49:41] <%shurtal> there is an army
[0:49:41] <+blastazoid00> Apparently
[0:49:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> maybe
[0:49:42] <FatalEYES> Yes, they did.
[0:49:43] <%Alazull> But a lot
[0:49:43] <%AHomeschoolDropout> yea basically
[0:49:44] <TioXyco> they are OP
[0:49:46] <Daxalog> He Jump good
[0:49:47] <%Reilata> Obviously, no problem.
[0:49:48] <%VictorVonLouche> ye
[0:49:48] <KatabolicRage> maybe?
[0:49:48] <%Nekros4442> THEY GOT THIS
[0:49:50] <+solomonpun> Either that or the monsters flew off to other places in the world
[0:49:50] <$StrawberryPantsu> Course they did
[0:49:50] <tanarath> Uh. Maybe? Hopefully?
[0:49:51] <+vaderxyz1970> Solo one v one
[0:49:51] <%BlueLunecy> Estinien IS kind of a freak
[0:49:52] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Yall see that grub hub pizza emote?
[0:49:55] <@goose_attack_almanac> Listen, Estinien has a really big murder boner.
[0:49:55] <$StrawberryPantsu> Estenian is that good
[0:49:56] <%RealThiele> ye
[0:49:58] <+Cybercobra2> guess so, but it is a elder wyrm and a superpowered dragoon
[0:49:58] <%JoshManVGH> I think so. Einsteinan loves BIG murder
[0:49:58] <$EsotericOdyssey> afaik they're uhh
[0:49:59] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt that scene from the trailer is happening RIGHT NOW
[0:49:59] <peachyprimrose> Estinien's useful when he actually has something to do
[0:50:01] <$EsotericOdyssey> still in the sky
[0:50:02] <%solracc25> maybe
[0:50:03] <jubejube56> just spam AoE a bit
[0:50:03] <+Vampireinarm> both of them can one shot them tbh
[0:50:06] <%Nekros4442> Estinien wentsuper mario on them mfers
[0:50:07] <%Ynkubus_> Our party and allies power level is nuts rn
[0:50:08] <$EsotericOdyssey> they're getting them as you speak
[0:50:09] <SweetCuppingCake> Is it just me or is the music distorted?
[0:50:15] <%UvBenServed> "I'll take the ones on the left, you take the ones on the right" - Estinien, probably
[0:50:16] <+vaderxyz1970> Estinian might as well be LV 91 Dragoon at this point
[0:50:17] <%baka_sugoi> look COOL
[0:50:18] <%Rigid_Iguana> ancient wyrm power level is high
[0:50:30] <KatabolicRage> I'm glad, cos that dungeon even before the expansion dropped was a pain to even get into
[0:50:31] <%JokerNewby> you can buy it on the moon
[0:50:41] <TioXyco> bast part about this one version is that is DYES completely, not just some straps
[0:50:47] <+extantCadence> I'm using the caster one and I'm kind of in love with this ridiculous coat
[0:50:49] <%AnIcedCoffee> You mean blue? Kappa
[0:50:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> you mean blue
[0:50:52] <VioletRosefall> yay
[0:50:53] <+Cybercobra2> purple is best colour
[0:50:54] <+MarkoTolstov> it's pain because as a Hrothgar, your entire nose and mouth clips through it, it's so painful
[0:50:54] <karl_rex> blue
[0:50:55] <tanithmagnus> what about Purple?
[0:50:56] <%Cactuskris> no you like red
[0:51:01] <%valriot> and these are actually purple too
[0:51:02] <+johnny_scissors> What if it was PURPLE! - Eric Andre
[0:51:03] <+acridpaladin> tahts what we're calling a+. that looks like what should be the norm
[0:51:06] <+Shady_Zaku> Purple is my faaaAAVE colour
[0:51:13] <%Alazull> That gear set makes you look like a present undyed
[0:51:15] <peachyprimrose> That's such a fucking phrase lmao. "You mean the blasphemy?"
[0:51:25] <%TheAntiNihilist> purple is death in Japan
[0:51:35] <%trancecarlito> you would never be the biggest dick dragoon in canon
[0:51:39] <dan_g_v> white is death in Japan
[0:51:42] <+vaderxyz1970> My childhood was purple
[0:51:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> WHITE is death in japan
[0:51:48] <%Nekros4442> THATS NOT GOOD
[0:51:50] <+Angrec> oh boy sure reminds me of shb
[0:51:56] <%Alazull> Yeah
[0:52:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> Purple is the rarist color in nature
[0:52:10] <%valriot> sky debuff
[0:52:11] <%NeonLight> so now it doesnt telegraph
[0:52:11] <ape_hawk> hey, the sky's fucky
[0:52:11] <%TheAntiNihilist> @dan_g_v then what is black and Purple?
[0:52:13] <+Vampireinarm> if the sky dosent cause it then you dont know where it might happen next
[0:52:16] <jorniev> the sky burning is something else?
[0:52:16] <+johnny_scissors> But what if sky up
[0:52:18] <+Cybercobra2> sky is a symptom, not the cause it seems
[0:52:19] <+MarkoTolstov> and that's what everyone else thought too
[0:52:21] <HeroToxiko> You could almost say the problem went heavensward
[0:52:22] <karl_rex> Makes sense the noise came from the earth
[0:52:30] <%kyh9> I assumed it was FF8’s lunar cry.  Maybe the burning sky is a hallucination
[0:52:31] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Did you look at what it says the weather is?
[0:52:32] <peachyprimrose> Some dude in Amaurot had a pebble fall on his head during the Final Days and imagined a meteor shower into being huh
[0:52:34] <+REDtheBEAST> Think of it as how lightning forms, it starts from the ground.
[0:52:35] <HeroToxiko> And brought the shadows
[0:52:39] <%Reilata> First despair, then death sky?
[0:52:49] <Calamity2007> Emet said himself in the Amaurot dungeon that the firey sky was due to the First Doom right?
[0:52:56] <%Monkeyweed21> was this whole thing caused by a bad trade deal?
[0:52:57] <wiDOPANos> dis pear?
[0:52:57] <dan_g_v> purple is royalty in msot places, no?
[0:52:59] <peachyprimrose> Are we Dangan Ronpa now
[0:52:59] <%valriot> DIS PEAR
[0:53:01] <%trancecarlito> its 2020 despair, then cali sky red
[0:53:01] <gespenst25> zetsuboshita
[0:53:01] <%Divryne> This pear.
[0:53:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> I knew ears would be the death of us
[0:53:04] <+Vampireinarm> Ultra Despair Girls?
[0:53:06] <%kyh9> So the sky is maybe a hallucination?
[0:53:06] <ape_hawk> i thought it was capitalism?
[0:53:08] <dan_g_v> that pear?
[0:53:08] <%Alazull> And what does Zenos want to bring?
[0:53:10] <%Nekros4442> god damnit pear
[0:53:11] <gespenst25> Shall I give you dis pear?
[0:53:12] <%AHomeschoolDropout> This is way worse than what the Sin Eaters could do holy shit

[0:53:17] <Eger007> we danganronpa now?
[0:53:20] <cartakus> The ntr emotion
[0:53:20] <%Monkeyweed21> So is this Danganronpa?
[0:53:20] <%JoshManVGH> Immediate freakbeast
[0:53:29] <%Nekros4442> Sin Eaters at least had to get a hit in
[0:53:29] <bloopmainbtw> imagine getting fired from work and turning into a huge monster
[0:53:34] <$EsotericOdyssey> not just instant monsters
[0:53:35] <$EsotericOdyssey> but
[0:53:36] <bloopmainbtw> rough out here
[0:53:37] <%RealThiele> immediate teeth monster
[0:53:37] <Daxalog> Danganronpa taking notes. Then folding those notes into a paper airplane. Then lighting it with a lighter.
[0:53:38] <dan_g_v> Final Fantasy is just a Magical Girl story made into rpg, like Precure fighting against the embodiment of despair
[0:53:38] <$EsotericOdyssey> your soul is gone
[0:53:40] <$EsotericOdyssey> forever
[0:53:40] <%solracc25> Sephiroth?
[0:53:42] <+johnny_scissors> big hmm
[0:53:43] <%Mr_Pylon> Kinda like RE Rev 2

[0:53:46] <+chase959> taste the despair ghost of the horororo lady from OP
[0:53:46] <%ChocolateMoofin> Is that what kingdom hearts kept trying to tell us?
[0:53:46] <%Alazull> @bloopmainbtw Yeah...imagine
[0:53:47] <$EsotericOdyssey> like, no afterlife
[0:53:48] <%afronooch> hmmmm
[0:53:53] <%cappyd33> :)
[0:53:54] <%JohnAtDawn> Don't all ancients?
[0:53:55] <Psyramics> Venat
[0:53:55] <Eger007> :)
[0:53:56] <tanarath> :)
[0:53:56] <%Maids4lyfe> why wouldn't she?
[0:53:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Nekros4442 The FLOOD OF LIGHT is the same way as this could of dark
[0:53:59] <heartlesshealer> hmmm
[0:54:02] <%valriot> ??? cos she was Venat no?
[0:54:02] <@goose_attack_almanac> Wasn't Hydaelyn created by Venat.
[0:54:03] <%Cactuskris> guess you´ll find out
[0:54:04] <gespenst25> Venat was there?
[0:54:04] <schiester420> venat
[0:54:05] <karl_rex> elpis
[0:54:06] <+Havictos> why wouldn't she?
[0:54:10] <$EsotericOdyssey> elpis
[0:54:11] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt She was an Amaroutine
[0:54:12] <dan_g_v> is she holding the Noise back?
[0:54:12] <Mildly_Eccentric> shall I give you this pear?
[0:54:13] <%RealThiele> :)
[0:54:18] <+blastazoid00> Hydaelyn is sus
[0:54:21] <+Havictos> I don't understand Pat
[0:54:27] <%shootbang_exe> it's really fun seeing pat run through a similar thought process to what I had around here
[0:54:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> IF we run into a mosnter named pandora
[0:54:33] <%JoshManVGH> Isn't Azem also a big nerd?
[0:54:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> I am gonna flip a table
[0:54:37] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt Do you remember why the flower reacts the way it does
[0:54:45] <tanithmagnus> @PatStaresAt Pat they were all nerds.
[0:54:49] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> Once again it's the classic fight between Zetsubo and Kibo
[0:54:53] <+Havictos> @dan_g_v no Zodiark was and without him we get whatever this is
[0:54:54] <%KuroStardust> Yup

[0:56:42] <dan_g_v> the one who was with the elephant man iirc
[0:56:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> IS THIS JUST DARKSOULS/DEMON SOULS
[0:56:46] <tanarath> Hmmmmm
[0:56:51] <$EsotericOdyssey> worse than hollowing
[0:56:59] <%RealThiele> the dark souls of final fantasy games LUL
[0:57:02] <+JustToWatch> isn't getting your soul atomized something that can be survived in this world?
[0:57:06] <peachyprimrose> As they should be
[0:57:07] <%afronooch> twinks
[0:57:08] <+REDtheBEAST> LUL
[0:57:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> because BACKLASH
[0:57:11] <KatabolicRage> the FIRST bunnyboy I saw ingame was wearing a maid outfit

[0:57:13] <+Cybercobra2> becouse bunny boys are born to fuck
[0:57:14] <+Vampireinarm> that means youre gay Kappa
[0:57:15] <%valriot> LUL well Pat...
[0:57:16] <tanarath> bishi
[0:57:16] <%AnIcedCoffee> because you made him so twinky
[0:57:17] <HeroToxiko> All a matter of perspective
[0:57:18] <%Axellogic> the nose?
[0:57:18] <heartlesshealer> bunny girls built for savagery and POWER
[0:57:19] <+JustToWatch> twinks
[0:57:19] <+Spawnbroker> dont hate!
[0:57:19] <+Mrbaconator> it's the man whores time to shine
[0:57:20] <%Alazull> I wonder if you become a bigger monster if you fall to despair if you're the one more people rely on
[0:57:21] <AlexDaGr8> pat a big gay
[0:57:21] <karl_rex> Amazon women vs fem men
[0:57:22] <+Havictos> for breeding purposes
[0:57:23] <$StrawberryPantsu> Cause bunny girls have 1 good face
[0:57:23] <Sydin18> Femboi power
[0:57:23] <17sevens> latent homosexuality
[0:57:23] <rReizs> do not use the teleporter while g'raha is following you or you will have to backtrack
[0:57:24] <%Monkeyweed21> designed for Breedability
[0:57:25] <%NeonLight> this is the way
[0:57:26] <+acridpaladin> because bunnies are always girls. even when boys
[0:57:26] <vicar_anat> ah yes the "Astolfo" effect
[0:57:26] <+BlubRobe> They have the spice
[0:57:27] <wiDOPANos> cuz ur gay? idk
[0:57:28] <wolverinewaswrong> why wouldn't they?
[0:57:29] <%Cozy90> THEY HAVE TO ATTRACT THE MATES
[0:57:29] <%legendfather_of_giants> that's because of your hair Pat
[0:57:31] <%Nekros4442> yo made him that way pat
[0:57:31] <+johnny_scissors> Because they're cute fem bnuys
[0:57:32] <MKII> because bunny girls look like Fran and she uggo
[0:57:32] <dan_g_v> because the girls are tough, while the guys are submissive and breedable
[0:57:32] <%JoshManVGH> Cause Bunny Girls were modeld after Frans weird face model, right?
[0:57:34] <+MightyDuckShoes> the girls are like tough some mommies
[0:57:34] <%Ynkubus_> WE GOT ANOTHER ONE
[0:57:34] <%kyh9> The bunny boys are sluttier
[0:57:35] <%AHomeschoolDropout> I made my bunboi look like griffith
[0:57:36] <%cappyd33> matriarchal society
[0:57:39] <%MidnightBurst12> not a bug but a feature
[0:57:39] <$EsotericOdyssey> @JustToWatch it's not just being torn apart, the soul and the energy that made it up does not exist anymore
[0:57:40] <MillaMoks> @PatStaresAt Its how their races sexual dimorphism plays out
[0:57:40] <%afronooch> nah for real I had the exact same though
[0:57:40] <RossMirage> I mean, CANONICALLY they are indistinguishable at a young age.
[0:57:41] <+rdark_ksu> only the prettiest bunnies
[0:57:41] <17sevens> no hate dick is awesome but
[0:57:43] <%RealThiele> look who they have to attract
[0:57:44] <tanithmagnus> that's why they live alone in the woods, to avoid the thirst
[0:57:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> Droped a Bridget on pat
[0:57:48] <Mildly_Eccentric> cause twink magic
[0:57:49] <+extantCadence> The girls are also super pretty, but yeah the boys are super pretty
[0:57:51] <Psyramics> didn't yu deliberately make the sluttiest bunbon possible?
[0:57:52] <cartakus> God there is going to be do much hentai of them
[0:57:55] <jorniev> YOU KNOW WHY
[0:57:56] <dan_g_v> but really, female viera are more fierce looking by default
[0:58:01] <+BlubRobe> @Monkeyweed21 Unironically. It's the only reason they go home to the forest after all.
[0:58:02] <%BeingTheVictor> @PatStaresAt is it ok to play a lady if you are guy
[0:58:09] <+johnny_scissors> Well of course he would make a character look like the biggest hero in Berserk
[0:58:11] <heartlesshealer> sweet black-haired griffith
[0:58:13] <+Havictos> you're a bad person
[0:58:18] <+MightyDuckShoes> come on. Griffith is objectively beautiful
[0:58:21] <%Alazull> Fellas is it gay to be prettier than a lady?
[0:58:26] <AlexDaGr8> aura jenny LUL

[0:58:32] <+JustToWatch> aren't male viero still like 6'3 on average
[0:58:35] <jubejube56> tiny fists of RAGE
[0:58:36] <+MightyDuckShoes> it's part of why he's unforgivable
[0:58:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Alazull No, Work it boy
[0:58:40] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> Asmongold literally made his bunny boy look like Griffith
[0:58:41] <%trancecarlito> Griffith did nothing but wrong but Bunny Griffith is a war criminal
[0:58:41] <+RowenCleric> how people liking this companion walk around stuff
[0:58:57] <+johnny_scissors> So female Viera are like 7'0?

[0:59:02] <%AHomeschoolDropout> @PatStaresAt You can actually guess what's causing the Final Days right now if you think about it hard enough
[0:59:03] <+Angrec> makes it really feel like a rpg

[1:00:09] <+johnny_scissors> Plenty of people already had that for Zenos
[1:00:10] <@CreepyPorpoise> Pat is on a journey of self-discovery right now.
[1:00:10] <peachyprimrose> Possibly but on the other end I saw people bitching about male Viera looking "feminine" before they even came out
[1:00:10] <riiloseah> yes.
[1:00:14] <+acridpaladin> I think thats just a furry.
[1:00:15] <%Ynkubus_> And awakenings
[1:00:15] <vicar_anat> this is the best addition ever
[1:00:17] <cartakus> YOU THINK?

[1:00:25] <$EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt if girl Hrothgar aren't huge and muscly we riot

[1:00:26] <%baka_sugoi> Caught THE GAY
[1:00:28] <Kenyuki4> like you Pat?
[1:00:29] <%YakumoYomi> "I hope this doesn't awaken something within me..."
[1:00:30] <dan_g_v> they are going to strip the bunnies down to nothing and then have an epiphany
[1:00:32] <+wunp_fxs> always with the furries
[1:00:32] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I'm only gay for fictional characters
[1:00:35] <%Alazull> @MKII Increase the budget by a couple million?
[1:00:35] <Daxalog> Fem hrothgar aint  shit though
[1:00:35] <%emperordread> That actually happened to me, but just not in FF14 LUL
[1:00:36] <MKII> what if they're hot
[1:00:36] <%kyh9> I have a girlfriend-to-be-wife and I’m mostly straight but If I found someone as twinky as a viera boy, I’d fuck them

[1:00:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> The Furries have always been there
[1:00:44] <peachyprimrose> Like weirdos getting VISCERALLY upset because of the thought of Limsa full of bunny boys wearing maid outfits
[1:00:48] <+Havictos> @peachyprimrose those are sad people I don't care to know
[1:00:49] <%MidnightBurst12> furries are never in low supply
[1:00:54] <KatabolicRage> female hrothgar already exist, go look at female ronso in ffx
[1:00:54] <a90minfacial> It's furries all the down from here.
[1:00:55] <%Chichen> They're just gonna be furry femroes but hunched over
[1:00:55] <cartakus> Dragon age inquisition did it for me

[1:00:57] <MKII> @MKII they got the cash now
[1:00:58] <%kyh9> I want them to be BaalBuddy tier
[1:00:59] <%AHomeschoolDropout> It starts off as dressing up your catgirls then you BECOME the cat girl
[1:01:00] <+MightyDuckShoes> it's Japan. they will just be girls with cat ears
[1:01:02] <BattlexQueen> they'll be ~toned~
[1:01:02] <RossMirage> I can see them being more panther-like instead of lion-like.
[1:01:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> Except Paige
[1:01:04] <+Vampireinarm> just import the females from FFx
[1:01:08] <%Reilata> Not beef enough.

[1:01:18] <+ALazo> How is plague going to feel?
[1:01:19] <@CreepyPorpoise> but its fine, only like 1% of players were going to use 'em anywaY
[1:01:19] <heartlesshealer> there's enough cute races now that the bunny boys are here
[1:01:20] <MKII> Hey, just make it a clan option. Do both
[1:01:21] <%Chichen> Make them BIGGER than the males
[1:01:22] <%Birdigalore> I'm fine with a furry femroe

[1:01:36] <peachyprimrose> Make them BIGGER THAN THE MALES
[1:01:36] <%kyh9> MUSCLE GIRLS
[1:01:37] <%Alazull> BUT I WANT A TIGER LADY!
[1:01:37] <Warbot40> They'll probably be slightly sleeker than femroe
[1:01:39] <%VictorVonLouche> They will just be the FFX super tall beast females
[1:01:41] <+ALazo> They looked rad
[1:01:41] <vicar_anat> and?
[1:01:42] <%RealThiele> Hi porp
[1:01:43] <Blank9> they're only going gay for completely unattainable twink standards, may as well get a 2d waifu at that point
[1:01:43] <%Chichen> THE ORIGINAL AU'RA females are so good
[1:01:43] <@goose_attack_almanac> And the FemRoe while big are still beautiful
[1:01:44] <heartlesshealer> HELL YEAH POWER WOMEN
[1:01:45] <Calamity2007> @kyh9 Nah we have M'quotes for that
[1:01:45] <%Birdigalore> Yeah less catgirls, more cat women
[1:01:45] <%SveriSageAdvice> YES WE WERE ROBBED
[1:01:46] <dan_g_v> need feral girls
[1:01:47] <+extantCadence> Make female Hrothgar built like Hildryn, the warframe
[1:01:47] <%AnIcedCoffee> I mean they'll just cheat and use the Fem Roe skeleton for Hroth ladies anyway so
[1:01:47] <Blu_C> But Pat, you're forgetting. Japan.
[1:01:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> and Cute potato gir- I can't finish that sentence without the FBI kicking down my door
[1:01:48] <PainterOfMiniatures> I want that!
[1:01:49] <%Tearonex> Why can't I get Miriko level muscles on my girls in game!?
[1:01:49] <HeroToxiko> HELL YEAH BROTHER
[1:01:53] <dan_g_v> like rip you in half girls
[1:01:53] <gespenst25> That wasn't the original design, that was one of several concepts
[1:01:54] <SweetCuppingCake> The concepts for Auri ladies was awesome
[1:01:54] <%livlinn> When do we get proper buff gurl woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:01:54] <BattlexQueen> scary panther women p
[1:01:55] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> We have cat girls but not cat furry girls psaUp
[1:01:57] <%ClericOfSparda> I wanted The demon dragon women
[1:01:59] <%RealThiele> Scaroused
[1:01:59] <PainterOfMiniatures> why couldn't we have the demon au ra women?
[1:01:59] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Concept Au Ra are way better
[1:02:00] <cartakus> Too much body types are neccessary
[1:02:00] <%Alazull> I want a tall muscular tiger lady to dominate me just a little
[1:02:01] <$realm_forge> I demand and a 9 foot tall cheeta Amazon
[1:02:03] <dan_g_v> like Tera's Castanic girls?
[1:02:04] <%whyskeywolfe> I need to know from one glance that a female Hrothgar can crush my skull with her thighs.
[1:02:05] <%Ynkubus_> Those designs were sick but would be clipping nightmres
[1:02:08] <%Alazull> And also in the game
[1:02:08] <Mildly_Eccentric> split the difference so NO ONE is happy
[1:02:09] <MKII> They're gonna look like Cheetara
[1:02:25] <VioletRosefall> Plague will for sure
[1:02:28] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Chances Plague hops on as soon as fem hrothgar comes in
[1:02:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> Paige is gonna be buff cat lady
[1:02:30] <%JokerNewby> buff girl supremacy
[1:02:31] <%legendfather_of_giants> Au Ra are scalies Pat
[1:02:32] <jmft2000> So bearded women are your favorite ha
[1:02:32] <%Reilata> Too much pretty, not enough beef scary lady.
[1:02:32] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Fucking Horathgar females arent femroe or we riot
[1:02:34] <+nivlac_555> need?
[1:02:35] <heartlesshealer> but you definitely wanna see it, even if you won't play it

[1:29:55] <%Alazull> Oh what's that? Chaos and bedlam?
[1:29:56] <okuriskyles> to the people saying "just kill them before they turn", DO YOU THINK THAT'LL MAKE PEOPLE ANY CALMER
[1:29:56] <%MidnightBurst12> it's a chain reaction too
[1:29:57] <Noponis> surely they wouldnt show a child die

[1:33:38] <SaltyAzteca> @Spydurman Thats the million gil question
[1:33:46] <%watts121> I love how they show how bad the situation can spiral out of control just from a SINGLE person transforming.
[1:33:50] <%Deft_Thought> Graha fucking rules
[1:33:54] <peachyprimrose> Imagine not liking G'raha, couldn't be me

[1:34:11] <%kyh9> The Mob Psycho effect
[1:34:11] <Louie_Salmon> @spydurman Surely not. If this was permanent even on another star, they might as well be dead
[1:34:16] <+Vampireinarm> Rauban has it on fucken lock
[1:34:17] <peachyprimrose> @cimturry Why the fuck is this so funny
[1:34:20] <%Agami23> even lyse is good in this situation
[1:34:21] <%ChocolateMoofin> @cimturry they're already demons lol
[1:34:22] <%valriot> unless youre estinien i guess LUL
[1:34:22] <ape_hawk> lets get weed for everyone
[1:34:23] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Damn, that's a great observation
[1:34:24] <%shootbang_exe> suddenly everyone under lyse's command turns into a monster
[1:34:25] <Blank9> aymeric
[1:34:27] <+Shockrates20XX> Raubahn: "dont' fucking be scared" You got it chief.
[1:34:27] <Daxalog> Give a bunch of Warhammer speeches and theyll be fine
[1:34:28] <gespenst25> No Sephiroth, we do not want dis pear.
[1:34:29] <@goose_attack_almanac> I wanna see Nanamo slap a monster

[1:34:43] <Sydin18> @stevenellis386 multi
[1:34:45] <umbraawitch> @stevenellis386 black mage i think
[1:34:45] <+Havictos> @patstaresat Where's Cid in all this?
[1:34:46] <Warbot40> Raubahn for sure after the patch content of SB
[1:34:48] <%watts121> Lyse's dumb punch-girl antics will keep people from being afraid
[1:34:49] <%cooldude69xx> @stevenellis386 catboy
[1:34:51] <%OneGorillionDollars> so what you are saying is ishgard is not totally fucked because Ameyric is a HUGE CHAD
[1:34:51] <AlexDaGr8> raubahn's literal first story act in ARR is making a big bombastic nationalism speech, he's got this shit on lock
[1:34:53] <+MrWrann> Ya, keep that giant elephant man hidden
[1:34:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat...smash...
[1:34:54] <%Birdigalore> Patron..smash
[1:34:54] <umbraawitch> nevermind LUL
[1:35:00] <rReizs> in trust dungeons graha will adapt to what role you're missing
[1:35:02] <+Havictos> @patstaresat Couldn't he somehow help?
[1:35:10] <jorniev> 🍐🍐🍐 VS HOPIUM
[1:35:13] <+Cybercobra2> but what is Palaka's stand? and what is its ability?
[1:35:13] <%livlinn> Saved by populism NotLikeThis
[1:35:22] <%JoshManVGH> This game askes "imagine a world where panic attacks kill you and everyone around you" and that's fucking terrifying
[1:35:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> OHBOY HERE I GO KILLING AGAIN
[1:35:29] <IntenseNerdRage> @cybercobra2  lmao
[1:35:29] <heartlesshealer> tres pear

[1:35:37] <%KuroStardust> Man this music is so dire I love it
[1:35:37] <%Monkeyweed21> is that a boss
[1:35:40] <penitentpendant> @rReizs The legendary power... OF FILL
[1:35:41] <%JoshManVGH> No wonder Amarout was fucked
[1:35:42] <%watts121> doing stuff like this as SMN sucked cuz half our abilities are AOE.
[1:35:46] <%Nordguy> what'd you pop besides gysahl greens?
[1:35:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> PAtron is happy as slong as he has a monster to fight
[1:35:50] <%Kevlar_Caviar> god i love the terminus enemies designs so much
[1:35:51] <%watts121> I would pick up like everyone's mobs
[1:35:52] <SaltyAzteca> YO SNATCHER
[1:35:55] <%Kevlar_Caviar> love this weird ass shit
[1:35:56] <$realm_forge> I feel the past 2 ish years had an effect on the story…could be wrong, but this seems rather topical
[1:36:01] <%Screwdatguy> His ability is called "What is right" Yo
[1:36:10] <peachyprimrose> "Terminus' as a word (for obv reasons) is so fucking dire
[1:36:19] <%RealThiele> yeah the extra large teeth motif def adds some horror
[1:36:19] <%MelBrooksKA> That little dog is so cute psaDogchamp
[1:36:24] <penitentpendant> I do like they override the zone music for this quest
[1:36:33] <%watts121> Chaotic Cyclone is so satisfying
[1:36:40] <%watts121> and why is he running
[1:36:45] <%watts121> cowardly PLD
[1:36:46] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @peachyprimrose yep, reminds me of kirby star allies' final boss being called termina
[1:36:46] <ArmadaGeddra> aww he missed it
[1:36:49] <%strakillias> Hey Pat when you get the bulldog mount you showed on twitter what will you name him? I vote for Gief Supreme (since you already have a smaller Gief)
[1:36:50] <gaelic_otaku> I did not like that doggy sound
[1:36:52] <%KuroStardust> LUL
[1:36:55] <Ahack13> Wow lol
[1:36:55] <%NeonLight> LUL
[1:36:59] <Sydin18> For some reason, quest mobs can be pulled by other ppl
[1:37:03] <gespenst25> Oh yeah I saw something similar
[1:37:04] <%ClericOfSparda> He probably voked as he ran by
[1:37:04] <bloopmainbtw> huh
[1:37:05] <+Havictos> @peachyprimrose isn't one definition "an end point"?
[1:37:08] <Blu_C> XD
[1:37:14] <%Monkeyweed21> forgot Tank Stance lol
[1:37:16] <rReizs> tank stance was enough
[1:37:18] <heartlesshealer> oof griefing potential
[1:37:24] <umbraawitch> i thought you weren't allowed to interfere with someones quest mobs
[1:37:27] <Ahack13> what a dick. You helped kill his and he just fucked off
[1:37:30] <ArmadaGeddra> First monster was the grandson
[1:37:44] <%watts121> I put on tank stance cuz getting Fate recognition is easy
[1:37:54] <gaelic_otaku> Terminus is an end point for trains or other types of transports
[1:37:55] <+MrWrann> If a city with an uncharasmatic leader all turn to demons then you basically have the start of a domino falling apocalypse.
[1:37:55] <IntenseNerdRage> @ahack13 never help people in a mmo.  let them die, take their quest npc for your own credit
[1:37:56] <%Kevlar_Caviar> OH GOD THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
[1:37:59] <%Kevlar_Caviar> UH OH
[1:38:01] <peachyprimrose> @Havictos A couple different things that mean "the end" yeah
[1:38:02] <%watts121> look at this nice INDEFENSIBLE town.
[1:38:04] <Sydin18> @umbraawitch they are in this expansion for some reason, since everyone is near the same level so they can help out here and there
[1:38:19] <%RealThiele> literally just a pit for a town
[1:38:23] <%MelBrooksKA> Is Pat still a Warrior?
[1:38:36] <AlexDaGr8> yup
[1:38:36] <ForlornHunter> Man that town must have flooding issues with it literally being a pit.
[1:38:45] <Ahack13> Its in a fucking pit
[1:38:50] <gespenst25> They have diplomatic neutrality
[1:38:53] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> @MelBrooksKA yes
[1:38:53] <%AHomeschoolDropout> In fact it's designed in such a way as it's a literal death pit
[1:39:01] <%Kevlar_Caviar> "horizontal hyur" LUL
[1:39:02] <gespenst25> Dead. OK
[1:39:04] <+MrWrann> Way to aid the corpse
[1:39:07] <%watts121> horizontal hyur sounds like a sex move
[1:39:10] <cimturry> you saved them!
[1:39:22] <%watts121> he's gonna transofrm
[1:39:30] <%RealThiele> 2 saved LUL
[1:39:34] <%Reilata> Should probably stab that guy.
[1:39:36] <+Pleblu> you save the pepoles
[1:39:39] <%Kevlar_Caviar> nah he'll be fine Kappa
[1:39:47] <jubejube56> dead.....dead......wants to dead
[1:39:47] <karl_rex> Rather die then turn into a monster and become nothing
[1:39:47] <AlexDaGr8> literal deaths of despair
[1:40:19] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> "Save" the viliagers
[1:40:23] <$EsotericOdyssey> this music whips ass
[1:40:24] <%Kevlar_Caviar> yeah the worst part about this is that when you turn in to a monster your soul is immediately obliterated
[1:40:27] <%RealThiele> Alphi give a good speech or somethin
[1:40:31] <Ahack13> The triumphant quest music feels a bit out of place right now lol
[1:40:32] <+Cybercobra2> dispair as plague
[1:40:34] <%Kevlar_Caviar> meaning there's literally no saving you once you turn
[1:40:35] <%Reilata> Save them like Arthas did.
[1:40:39] <+Havictos> @patstaresat any guess on how we're supposed to solve this shit?
[1:40:51] <umbraawitch> @Ahack13 we did it patrick! we saved the city
[1:40:57] <cimturry> give everyone a hug
[1:41:00] <AlexDaGr8> @Reilata GOD if they set up Alphinaud to be another Arthas I will shit my whole ass

[1:41:14] <Zombrocom> You know actually
[1:41:16] <%the_pzp> the_pzp subscribed with Prime. 
[1:41:18] <%Reilata> @Reilata LUL
[1:41:19] <Zombrocom> TONS OF WEED is genuinely a great idea
[1:41:20] <%Spawnbroker> We have to kill sadness! With swords!
[1:41:21] <+JustToWatch> gotta kill Sephiroth
[1:41:22] <%cooldude69xx> Super Satan

[1:41:37] <$EsotericOdyssey> STAB THE FREUDIAN DEATH DRIVE
[1:41:39] <%Kevlar_Caviar> inb4 zenos gets so upset that he can't fight you that he turns into a monster LUL
[1:41:41] <gespenst25> Defeating the negative space wedge is direct action
[1:41:41] <penitentpendant> You must kill... DESPAIR ITSELF! (Probably some manifestation or something.)
[1:41:42] <+polothegreatest> AGAIN? LUL
[1:41:44] <bloopmainbtw> double satan LUL
[1:41:45] <%Nordguy> Kill Suicide, Patron!!!
[1:41:46] <%RealThiele> Stab the Despair
[1:41:50] <%solracc25> Kill chaos again
[1:41:53] <Warbot40> Oh god Emmanelain might actually be useful during this apocalypse. He has a little bit of Haurchefant in him.
[1:41:56] <umbraawitch> SATAN......2!
[1:41:57] <%Monkeyweed21> LETS JUST GO TO HELL AND KILL SATAN-Plague of Gripes
[1:41:57] <Ahack13> @Zombrocom Until you get an anxiety attack from it and turn into a demon
[1:42:23] <Blu_C> Is it just me, or does dwelling on the horrible happenings seem like EXACTLY the wrong thing to be doing?
[1:42:28] <wolverinewaswrong> can't believe they put heartless into this
[1:42:38] <+JSebz> does cringe from dealing with emmanelain count as despair?
[1:42:39] <%Kevlar_Caviar> yeah that seems to be a horrible idea
[1:42:39] <cimturry> why do all of these elephant bros have chode faces?
[1:42:41] <+transporterthesequel> MSQ done and dusted, now I can FULLY ORB UP.
[1:42:41] <+Havictos> well the voice sounded female right?
[1:42:54] <%MelBrooksKA> When Nobodies spyCappa
[1:42:55] <+MrWrann> It's fine, they can dwell on it now because the story says they can't turn
[1:43:00] <+Havictos> that said finally
[1:43:12] <%Cozy90> Blow your snout at them elephant man
[1:43:18] <%Nordguy> @cimturry explain
[1:43:20] <%RealThiele> this MSQ is dense def will be hitting up NG+
[1:43:22] <gespenst25> Something horrible?
[1:43:23] <jubejube56> Hey remember these incredibly kind people? Well they might die before your eyes
[1:43:27] <artoflec> is that a chocobo what is that it looks awesome
[1:43:28] <jubejube56> Really is a no win situation huh
[1:43:28] <+Ryaotz> we did

[1:43:31] <%Dregon_Azure> you did already
[1:43:35] <rReizs> the dungeon had the family
[1:43:36] <Zombrocom> We totally did
[1:43:36] <%Dregon_Azure> in the dungeon
[1:43:36] <KatabolicRage> I mean do the elephant guys count cos you saw them turn in teh dungeon
[1:43:37] <+zuzuxiv> no you already did
[1:43:39] <%watts121> I mean do you consider the elephant people beast tribe?
[1:43:40] <heartlesshealer> ?
[1:43:40] <%AHomeschoolDropout> They're probably gonna call in the primals and double fuck everything
[1:43:41] <+ragermister> Their tempering probably doesn't allow them to feel sad
[1:43:42] <%Monkeyweed21> it was in the dungeon
[1:43:42] <%Reilata> Wasn't one like a giant elephant face? Maybe that was one.
[1:43:42] <%Kevlar_Caviar> some of the dungeon monsters had elephant faces
[1:43:42] <%SveriSageAdvice> they did turn in the dungeon
[1:43:44] <rReizs> but you probably missed it doing something
[1:43:46] <umbraawitch> @artoflec well sort of its a shadowbringers mount
[1:43:48] <Zombrocom> Remember the big inside out elephant head
[1:43:49] <karl_rex> Nor animals
[1:43:50] <dan_g_v> huh, good point
[1:43:54] <rosemon5001> 10bucks on their kalimaaaaahing the baby
[1:43:55] <Zourath> The elephant scorpion, remember?
[1:43:56] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Damn, this music fire
[1:43:57] <+JustToWatch> So Zenos probably doesn't even notice this shit right
[1:43:57] <%JoshManVGH> Wasn't there an elephant head like thing in the 85 dungeon?
[1:44:01] <Zombrocom> I don't actually know man
[1:44:02] <%RealThiele> the elephants were in your dungeon just unrecognizable as such
[1:44:07] <Zombrocom> I haven't seen anything past you
[1:44:09] <umbraawitch> the goopy human meatiness of temple of zot is really gross
[1:44:10] <Warbot40> So if the trigger is despair, is there another prerequisite for turning that we know already?
[1:44:11] <%SveriSageAdvice> no worries, you hopped from the podcast right to here lol
[1:44:14] <ForlornHunter> @artoflec Chocobo equivalent in Shadowbringers. Acquired by leveling every job to 80
[1:44:20] <+Havictos> @joshmanvgh it used to be one of these guys
[1:44:25] <Zombrocom> Nah we get it
[1:44:30] <artoflec> oh cool
[1:44:31] <%Alazull> Yeah you did
[1:44:31] <@Velyndra> oh shit hes almost at the tiger fist fight QTE
[1:44:35] <%Alazull> The second boss
[1:44:40] <%SinnerEbru> i do like how the podcast gave u like an extra 400 viewers tho lmfao
[1:44:40] <+transporterthesequel> It really is. I watch in SILENCE, and then explode when the spoiler happens.
[1:44:43] <+MrWrann> Gonna come back to a corpse
[1:44:49] <+Havictos> @velyndra I'm sorry?
[1:44:49] <@Velyndra> :)
[1:44:55] <%JoshManVGH> Vel playing with fire
[1:44:57] <%Kevlar_Caviar> this is the second time pat's almost accidentally had someone banned due to misreading their comment LUL can't say i blame him for being paranoid tho
[1:44:59] <thehelminator> have you checked the weather?
[1:45:01] <%RealThiele> dont do anything sad while we are gone dude
[1:45:06] <Sydin18> "Haha..this sucks man"
[1:45:12] <umbraawitch> its a yakuza joke
[1:45:14] <%Reilata> there it is
[1:45:14] <%RealThiele> @thehelminator he has
[1:45:15] <%Nordguy> Can't Wait until par has to fight cyber-shoto
[1:45:15] <%Kevlar_Caviar> speaking of elephant scorpions there's one now
[1:45:19] <Zombrocom> Oh hey, speaking of giant elephant head
[1:45:19] <karl_rex> Why don't animals turn?
[1:45:22] <+transporterthesequel> Hi inside out Elephant face scorpion
[1:45:31] <Warbot40> The Wrecker was a boss
[1:45:38] <jubejube56> Has elephant scorpion been done in other things before?
[1:45:40] <artoflec> yeah its fantastic
[1:45:41] <%RealThiele> ye THATS an elephant jesus
[1:45:42] <+transporterthesequel> It is, and it's fuckin HORRIFYING.
[1:45:53] <%JoshManVGH> Fucking nightmare shit all-over
[1:45:54] <okuriskyles> because animals aren't capable of feeling despair
[1:45:54] <+extantCadence> Yeah the elephant scorpion really got me
[1:45:57] <cimturry> squorpians are the elephants natural enemy
[1:45:59] <%Kevlar_Caviar> OH NO
[1:45:59] <Srthunda> its like the opposite of a face hugger
[1:46:00] <ForlornHunter> Those chicken monsters I find most unsettling
[1:46:00] <peachyprimrose> Oh no
[1:46:04] <Ahack13> ALl of the Blasphemy designs are fucking sick
[1:46:05] <%Kevlar_Caviar> PLEASE NOT MATSYA
[1:46:07] <%Reilata> Uh
[1:46:16] <%watts121> man they really did the eyes on the elephants good
[1:46:20] <+REDtheBEAST> NotLikeThis tomatoPain BibleThump
[1:46:23] <umbraawitch> please not matsya
[1:46:24] <%Kevlar_Caviar> oh thank god this random dude is alive, if matsya turns i will actually die
[1:46:25] <penitentpendant> Oof
[1:46:26] <%Kevlar_Caviar> OH NO
[1:46:31] <%JoshManVGH> "So I came to witness the horrors which could turn me at any moment" good plan.
[1:46:38] <Zombrocom> Fuuuuuccckkk
[1:46:39] <%JoshManVGH> Oh...
[1:46:43] <dan_g_v> get angry man, avenge them!
[1:46:44] <%RealThiele> as a healer: "bruh i can heal him?"
[1:46:46] <HeroToxiko> just two weeks from retirement..
[1:46:47] <%JoshManVGH> Ooh
[1:46:49] <FirewallStorm> dont be a bitch
[1:46:50] <Daxalog> These scenes must be so weird fi your playing a healer.
[1:46:51] <Zombrocom> That's super not great
[1:46:52] <%Nordguy> @umbraawitch :)
[1:46:56] <umbraawitch> PHEWWW
[1:46:58] <$EsotericOdyssey> this fucking piano music tears my heart out
[1:47:00] <$EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt
[1:47:09] <%Mr_Pylon> well that fucking got me
[1:47:12] <peachyprimrose> Why would they be weird for healers?
[1:47:13] <therossz> Dudes a white mage cant heal depression lmao
[1:47:18] <%Kevlar_Caviar> wait so even if you're 2 seconds from death you can still turn? jesus christ
[1:47:19] <%cooldude69xx> @Daxalog I would RP a healer as really bitchy to justify it
[1:47:19] <%legendfather_of_giants> @RealThiele FFXIV healers just accelerate natural healing, they can't do anything about mortal wounds
[1:47:24] <%ClericOfSparda> @Daxalog It gets frustrating as a WHM, yeah
[1:47:28] <peachyprimrose> Healers can't bring people back from the dead, just from being "knocked out"
[1:47:32] <Sydin18> @therossz or trauma
[1:47:39] <SaltyAzteca> @therossz The biggest mood of them all
[1:47:42] <umbraawitch> just use a phoenix down on aertih 4Head
[1:47:44] <%Snoothulhu> thelad49Screm
[1:47:48] <%Birdigalore> Esuna doesn't remove crippling depression
[1:47:50] <dan_g_v> man, there are going to be tons of compilations of people crying at the whole thing
[1:47:52] <%Deft_Thought> People die when they are killed
[1:47:55] <+transporterthesequel> Yes, any overwhelming despair gets you
[1:47:56] <dan_g_v> I'm not tearing up
[1:47:56] <+Shockrates20XX> I think it's despair in general. Fear of others dying too.
[1:47:58] <%Reilata> Excessive bad emotions in general?
[1:47:59] <+Pleblu> brownMOOD
[1:48:04] <$EsotericOdyssey> @Kevlar_Caviar and if you turn before you die your soul is gone forever and nothing of you exists ever again
[1:48:05] <%Kevlar_Caviar> OH GOD IT'S A LEMUR KILL IT
[1:48:08] <Sydin18> nah, that monkey attacked me too during this part :/
[1:48:08] <%Arweynn> so this is just the nier expansion isn't it?
[1:48:10] <%RealThiele> Seto <3
[1:48:10] <%Gasgrave> Fear of death, but people still die when they are killed, Pat.
[1:48:10] <nechronia> The issue with healing is that you cant make the healer that good at it or the story gets suuuper broken
[1:48:12] <ForlornHunter> You think if a person was put to sleep mid transform they wouldn’t fully transform
[1:48:13] <%Kevlar_Caviar> POWERFUL JUNGLE BEAST
[1:48:17] <KatabolicRage> it has an unfortunate tendancy to snowball
[1:48:20] <jubejube56> End of the world and a friggen monkey starts smacking ya
[1:48:21] <+Cybercobra2> oh god this better not take place before exam week, or every teenager is about to turn
[1:48:22] <rReizs> sephiroth: yo this despair transformation shit is awesome how do i get it on my world
[1:48:30] <%watts121> which might as well just be death cuz most people don't wanna die. You lay there bleeding out alone and will probably change
[1:48:31] <cimturry> haunted houses would be such a problem right now
[1:48:34] <%Monkeyweed21> Everything will be fine as long as no one spills the beans about the transformation causing your soul to rot away into nothingness
[1:48:37] <+transporterthesequel> Pat here's a spoiler bigger fell cleave is REALLY RAD.
[1:48:37] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @EsotericOdyssey real fun way to go!
[1:48:37] <@goose_attack_almanac> @ForlornHunter depends on how asleep you are if that would even work.
[1:48:38] <%Spawnbroker> All of the music in this expansion has been bangers. Praise Soken
[1:48:39] <penitentpendant> @Arweynn This is the expansion Yoshi P gets to show off what he learned from Yoko Taro, apparently
[1:48:40] <%Arweynn> evil music that destroys the world and turns everyone into monsters, a magic flower...
[1:48:40] <peachyprimrose> @ForlornHunter Then they might just have fucked up depression dreams that make them turn anyway
[1:48:44] <%chance_h> Is horny a negative emotion?
[1:48:46] <Grunkle_Dan_> this music is an absolute banger, one of my favourites of the entire expansion
[1:48:48] <+MrWrann> Call someone a nerd to hard right now and they'll turn into a demon to kill you.
[1:48:49] <+SargentToughie> NGL this might be the most dire apocalypse situation I've ever seen in a video game
[1:49:01] <%watts121> yeah but it isn't an arid shithole like Gyr Abania
[1:49:07] <+Katohearts> Upper?
[1:49:08] <%SveriSageAdvice> except it has an actually interesting landscape this time lol
[1:49:09] <Calamity2007> The better Fringes
[1:49:11] <therossz> gamers see any media using emotional metaphors and is like "this is Kingdom Hearts hehe"
[1:49:14] <ForlornHunter> The fringes but cooler
[1:49:18] <quigley_plays> The only way to stall it would be to replace zodiark, anyone got cloud of darkness's number so she can cover his shift?
[1:49:19] <+transporterthesequel> It's like zombies but it spreads by DESPAIR.
[1:49:24] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Monkeyweed21 OH FUCK I DIDN'T EVEN THINK OF THAT. "don't be afraid or your soul will literally be erased" is just gonna make people panic even more
[1:49:24] <%Mantorok06> Hiya Pat, I finished the MSQ so now I'll be able to watch!
[1:49:24] <@goose_attack_almanac> @chance_h what kinda horny. Desperate horny, or the type that makes you want to see space and other peoples in the universe
[1:49:26] <jubejube56> oh it's the lorax
[1:49:26] <%cooldude69xx> Is this or Reaper Invasion a more dire armageddon?
[1:49:33] <penitentpendant> @ForlornHunter I dub this place: "Better Fringes"
[1:49:33] <%lucky_icarus> @patstaresat Whats up with the 2 thrill of battles(I think thats what it is) and infuriates next to each other?
[1:49:38] <+iheartmota> Junko would come seeing this event
[1:49:39] <+Havictos> this by far
[1:49:40] <KatabolicRage> I mean yeah, we're talking about the thing that had amaraut at a complete loss at how to deal with beyond a TERRIBLE stopgap
[1:49:43] <+transporterthesequel> More dire, WAY more
[1:49:57] <%watts121> if being sad indoctrinated you
[1:49:58] <%Deft_Thought> This is also written better
[1:50:02] <%chance_h> Reaper because you have to endure mass effect 3
[1:50:04] <luciluxlu0> it kinda like ffxv but with emotions
[1:50:18] <Zombrocom> At least the reaper invasion had the obvious solution of "Kill the reapers" we solve this... how?
[1:50:24] <therossz> The Amouratines also knew more in advance and had more means to deal with it
[1:50:31] <%legendfather_of_giants> why isn't reprisal there then?
[1:50:32] <%watts121> also better paced then FFXV
[1:50:35] <+Havictos> Imagine if being scared turned you into a Reaper and it just cascaded from there
[1:50:36] <Warbot40> How did daemons work in XV again?
[1:50:37] <%Dregon_Azure> im 89 pld now, so close to the end
[1:50:37] <%lucky_icarus> @patstaresat Ah okay, fair enough. I just usually leave them empty
[1:50:40] <+iheartmota> yea despair is a emotion constantly being held in check is too much to bear for any longer period of time
[1:50:48] <%cooldude69xx> @Zombrocom Kill the despair boss
[1:50:56] <+wizard_of_diamonds> MEANWHILE
[1:51:00] <+Havictos> meanwhile bad shit
[1:51:00] <peachyprimrose> ESTINIEEEEEEN! (He's the Azure Dragoon!)
[1:51:01] <ape_hawk> meanwhile, more death!
[1:51:02] <%Kevlar_Caviar> just kill despair 4Head
[1:51:11] <%MidnightBurst12> sky boys
[1:51:13] <%JoshManVGH> "Meanwhile, in Garlimald..."
[1:51:13] <ForlornHunter> I’m surprised the meteor rain isn’t actually damaging weather type
[1:51:22] <luciluxlu0> @warbot40 evil night particles or something
[1:51:22] <okuriskyles> i think the amorauntines also had the disadvantage of literally never having anything go wrong in their lives though
[1:51:23] <%chance_h> Lol best bros
[1:51:23] <+JustToWatch> "gotta be honest not great"
[1:51:24] <+Havictos> oh wow they just took them all out huh?
[1:51:25] <%watts121> remember at the end of the last dungeon where the freaking monsters looked like the squid robots from the matrix?
[1:51:26] <dan_g_v> this sounds like self sacrifice music
[1:51:26] <cimturry> airdrop a shitload of weed
[1:51:30] <+Pleblu> evrybody ded
[1:51:30] <+MrWrann> You can't say things are bad anymore, he might turn
[1:51:45] <peachyprimrose> What happens if a dragon feels despair
[1:51:46] <%Kevlar_Caviar> ...what happens if vrtra gets overcome with despair?
[1:51:48] <42nfl19> CHAOS?
[1:51:53] <Metii_Morst> Hes so tired
[1:52:00] <okuriskyles> from what emet-selch described, it sounded like they literally couldn't imagine a society that wasn't utopian
[1:52:01] <AngryAsian5> "Shit's fucked dude."
[1:52:01] <%JohnAtDawn> "he fell" sounds much more generous than "he got eaten like a bitch"
[1:52:08] <therossz> Its not just sadness its panic, its not like you cant convey information
[1:52:08] <+chimaera24> So can a dragon turn?
[1:52:11] <Sydin18> Grief stricken father? More like traumatized for life father
[1:52:11] <+Akizea> @Metii_Morst not tired, sad
[1:52:21] <jubejube56> oh geez can a dragon get despaired?
[1:52:21] <gaelic_otaku> Imagine if Vrtra turned
[1:52:26] <%chance_h> Things are alight, we’ve only lost 80% of the world
[1:52:30] <+MrWrann> But they just say it anyway, no time was saved
[1:52:35] <+Havictos> Midgardsormr better wake the fuck up real soon.
[1:52:47] <artoflec> uh so what was it that turned people into the Bayonetta angels in Shadowbringer? wasn't it just some big evil forcing it?
[1:52:48] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> sad dragon : c
[1:52:50] <%Kevlar_Caviar> PLEASE DO NOT WALLOW
[1:52:53] <+Solutha> i mean the dragons came here after the sundering so
[1:52:57] <%Kevlar_Caviar> NO SERIOUSLY AVOID WALLOWING
[1:53:00] <+Akizea> @Havictos whatchu mean, he aint sleep hes hella dead, just has a strong spirit
[1:53:04] <%ClericOfSparda> Estinien: Stop being such a bit*h
[1:53:06] <gaelic_otaku> Just be happy fivehead
[1:53:07] <Metii_Morst> Also its very good that they didnt use the dragon language for Vrtra
[1:53:07] <%Kevlar_Caviar> monkaS
[1:53:09] <ForlornHunter> His two giant tusks seem more ornamental then actually useful
[1:53:09] <%legendfather_of_giants> @artoflec too much light mana
[1:53:10] <okuriskyles> @artoflec yeah they just got bit, basically
[1:53:22] <artoflec> okay got it
[1:53:23] <BattlexQueen> dont despair vrtra
[1:53:25] <okuriskyles> it was more of a regular zombie type mechanic
[1:53:26] <%Reilata> Well there might be a lot less of men to be at war with.
[1:53:27] <ape_hawk> vrtra, dont be getting depressed now
[1:53:29] <quigley_plays> @artoflec It was an imbalance of aether, it'd be like if you took too many iron supplements (like 30 pounds) and turned into a transformer
[1:53:33] <+transporterthesequel> Anyone already point out that Vrtra speaks mortal? Because that's super rad.
[1:53:34] <rReizs> ishgard has leadership that isn't pants on head now so it would be fine
[1:53:34] <HeroToxiko> Seasonal depression is wildly successful as a status effect
[1:53:35] <+Havictos> @akizea after the omega raids he went back to sleep
[1:53:36] <Zombrocom> FF14 sure likes their zombie-style apocalypses
[1:53:38] <%Kiyosuki> Dragons might follow a different set of rules cause they come from another world
[1:53:41] <artoflec> nice i wanna be a transformer
[1:53:42] <SaltyAzteca> NO YOURE COOL THO
[1:53:51] <+Pleblu> I guess he doesnt realize how hype he is
[1:53:55] <+slidshockingkrow> Vritra's just a good dude
[1:53:56] <+Akizea> @Havictos you mean the young one from the past we fought? lol
[1:53:59] <+Havictos> @akizea which is why he hasn't been around
[1:54:03] <cimturry> i hope the moral of this story is "just stop being depressed"
[1:54:05] <%Birdigalore> I'm glad they brought back Gosetsu's VA
[1:54:13] <+natjen8> the estinien char growth Pog
[1:54:20] <+slidshockingkrow> did we ever find out where dragons originally came from?
[1:54:21] <peachyprimrose> Look how much Estinien has groooooooooown
[1:54:34] <%Monkeyweed21> @slidshockingkrow space
[1:54:39] <ForlornHunter> Oh shit is that actually Gosetsu’s va?
[1:54:42] <peachyprimrose> Another planet, not much more than that afaik
[1:54:44] <ohno778> Heavensward was awesome yes
[1:54:44] <KatabolicRage> I mean shit man, he started as a side story character for the dragoon job quests
[1:54:45] <rReizs> i still call lance charge blood for blood
[1:54:49] <Metii_Morst> @slidshockingkrow we have a general idea from the Omega raids
[1:54:49] <%legendfather_of_giants> @slidshockingkrow they're aaaaaliens
[1:54:50] <KatabolicRage> in ARR
[1:54:51] <+fishmonger555> i kinda miss brooding edgelord, but himbo can stay
[1:54:53] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt When asked in times of danger, 9/10 citizens responded they preferred dragon leadership. The tenth citizen is a fucking moron.
[1:54:55] <+zuzuxiv> did vrtra just pog
[1:54:55] <%NeonLight> at least he admits how edgy he is
[1:54:55] <penitentpendant> Estinien's been hanging out with Alphy too long. The heroic speeches have rubbed off on him.
[1:54:58] <%Kiyosuki> From Dragon Hunter to Dragon Knight.
[1:55:01] <@QueequegTheater> FeelsBadMan
[1:55:02] <%MelBrooksKA> Is this the back story of that Dragonsong song?
[1:55:03] <%RealThiele> Estinien gaining all those extra dimensions <3
[1:55:07] <okuriskyles> y'all, depression is not the problem, it's having acute panic attacks
[1:55:09] <+Havictos> @akizea didn't Vritra say he's asleep still?
[1:55:11] <+JSebz> Estinien learned moral debate from alphi for sure
[1:55:15] <%Buttlo> atpFeelsBeardMan
[1:55:22] <%Reilata> LUL
[1:55:27] <gaelic_otaku> Hey look it's the trailer
[1:55:28] <jorniev> damn estinien
[1:55:28] <okuriskyles> if "being sad" was a trigger literally everyone but zenos would turn
[1:55:30] <@QueequegTheater> I'm so glad Estinien got to actually matter in the story instead of just sorta being there
[1:55:41] <Metii_Morst> trailer moment
[1:55:41] <+fishmonger555> HE SAID THE LINE
[1:55:41] <%NeonLight> He said the thing!!
[1:55:41] <%Solareon_> DEVOUR HIS CUM
[1:55:41] <nechronia> Thank fuck we built the Firmament before this happened
[1:55:42] <%JoshManVGH> So does Uldah
[1:55:43] <peachyprimrose> HE SAID THE THING
[1:55:45] <%valriot> DEVOUR HIS CUM
[1:55:45] <+JSebz> he said it
[1:55:48] <Daniel_Is_I> HE SAID THE THING
[1:55:48] <rReizs> in one of the side stories estinien finds out that dragoons used to ride dragons to battle before the betrayal
[1:55:49] <Ahack13> Do depressed animals transform too?
[1:55:51] <SaltyAzteca> YEYEYEYEYE
[1:55:51] <+slidshockingkrow> he said it boys
[1:55:52] <gaelic_otaku> He did the thing!

[1:57:20] <%NopeBadguy> How does it feel to have chat thirsting over your character Pat
[1:57:23] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt There has to be a range limit to the transformation right? Cause even if you run away then, you can still transform?
[1:57:24] <+zuzuxiv> i wasnt expecting pat's bun to be hot :^)
[1:57:26] <heartlesshealer> because pat color-coordinated his outfit
[1:57:39] <%Kiyosuki> yeah and a lot of the Dragoon job quest stuff in Stormblood adds more to Estinien's development too
[1:57:39] <+JustToWatch> there is no village left
[1:57:44] <penitentpendant> @Torenology It's their evolutionary defense mechanism. Too hot to kill.
[1:57:45] <+transporterthesequel> last stream pats bun looked like a coke dealer. this is MUCH better
[1:58:00] <%Reilata> LUL nice

[1:58:18] <LunarRemix> I think it did got an updated rating
[1:58:18] <%JoshManVGH> I'LL SAY!
[1:58:19] <HeroToxiko> MURDER unlocked
[1:58:19] <Daxalog> Tasteful violance. You didnt see that guy get crunched in twain.
[1:58:23] <%Kiyosuki> I like to see it as the transition from dragoons being used to hunt dragons and steal their power to fighting with dragons and sharing it.
[1:58:24] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @trackles_64 well that one kid got literally squished to death so yeah
[1:58:24] <+zuzuxiv> yeah the facial hair didnt look great tbh
[1:58:24] <FirewallStorm> fuck yeah
[1:58:25] <%watts121> FF16 is gonna be dark, I'm telling you. Yoshi P is off the chain
[1:58:26] <%RealThiele> like a dude getting Vored
[1:58:28] <+Cybercobra2> that one kid did get stomped on just on screen
[1:58:29] <%justacrow84> This whole thing felt like I was watching the Eclipse
[1:58:30] <%AHomeschoolDropout> It's actually boarding on Beserk-tier
[1:58:31] <%JoshManVGH> That Train is NEVER getting cleaned...
[1:58:33] <Ids560> oh yeah we did have a dude eat a bullet
[1:58:40] <+Havictos> @sverisageadvice but I might fantasia one of my retainers
[1:58:40] <gespenst25> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[1:58:42] <%SveriSageAdvice> @Havictos im still attached to my miqote, she's a qt lol, so i just made an alt
[1:58:44] <%Alazull> Yeah
[1:58:49] <+Solutha> they should redo the sin eater transform to be more graphic like they wanted LUL
[1:58:57] <jorniev> and now the dude I liked a lot got ate
[1:59:12] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Technically we didn't see or hear that, the gunshot was just implied
[1:59:14] <%RealThiele> ye RIP Satrap
[1:59:16] <+transporterthesequel> Two children literally bled out in the cold rather than be tainted by MAGIC
[1:59:17] <%Alazull> A man got ate
[1:59:22] <KatabolicRage> god, limsa still has FLINTLOCKS while garlemald have revolvers with cased ammunition, tahts all I can think of when I think of that garlemald scene
[1:59:25] <ForlornHunter> Man I still have my ARR free fantasia I don’t know what to do with it.
[1:59:27] <+transporterthesequel> Endwalker is throwin DARK
[1:59:27] <penitentpendant> @Kiyosuki To the inevitable fan fiction end: Dragon Dragoon Hybrids
[1:59:33] <+iheartmota> pretty intense to see a child get murdered in any fiction
[1:59:45] <%Kevlar_Caviar> the first couple seconds of this song sounds like rajang's theme
[1:59:48] <gespenst25> splat
[1:59:49] <+Havictos> it was fucked
[1:59:50] <+ALazo> went pop
[1:59:51] <%RealThiele> happy quest theme
[1:59:55] <+MrWrann> He was a monster by then, doesn't count
[1:59:59] <Sydin18> OMG I AM A HUGE FAN
[1:59:59] <%Kiyosuki> @penitentpendant I mean the Firmamment story brings us one step closer to that lol
[2:00:03] <@goose_attack_almanac> Nah we saw a child dissolve into a monster and then get crushed.
[2:00:03] <%ShawnTK_> Ardbert yet lives
[2:00:03] <KatabolicRage> I wander if the midlander male population surged cos of that face

[2:00:14] <%RealThiele> Tesleen tho
[2:00:21] <%Ebonyglow> cohhBongos
[2:00:22] <%JohnAtDawn> I'm honestly surprised Ardbert hasn't shown up. Is he just watching everything?
[2:00:27] <dan_g_v> wow!
[2:00:33] <+iheartmota> monsterfied is pretty much death anyway
[2:00:36] <%Alazull> I mean maybe?
[2:00:37] <+slidshockingkrow> now that I think about it, is Ardbert a Vergil?
[2:00:41] <%watts121> @JohnAtDawn completely absorbed now
[2:00:44] <Zombrocom> Isn't ardbert stuck in the first?
[2:00:50] <Srthunda> we absorbed him
[2:00:54] <Daniel_Is_I> We ATE HIM
[2:00:54] <KatabolicRage> yeah he kinda rejoined with you
[2:00:55] <%MidnightBurst12> oh
[2:00:56] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> We are him
[2:00:56] <%yendoria> You absorbed his soul
[2:00:56] <+transporterthesequel> yes
[2:00:57] <rReizs> they gattai'd
[2:00:59] <+Cybercobra2> we absorbed aardbert
[2:00:59] <+JivetheSuperTurkey> is the audio supposed to be offkey at parts?
[2:01:00] <%Gasgrave> He can still talk to you though
[2:01:00] <Grunkle_Dan_> he is firmly inside you
[2:01:00] <@TheYellowcouch> Ardbert is doing EVERYTHING technically
[2:01:00] <%shurtal> he got osmosed
[2:01:02] <%shootbang_exe> we are-dbert
[2:01:04] <gaelic_otaku> Is Ardbert the Warrior of Darkness?
[2:01:05] <+Havictos> no ardbert is us
[2:01:05] <%JoshManVGH> We ate him
[2:01:06] <gespenst25> I am thou thou art me, we're a happy family
[2:01:07] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> he is Us
[2:01:09] <Tracazoid> We are Ardbert and he is us
[2:01:10] <%Monkeyweed21> we ate him
[2:01:11] <%Spawnbroker> We schlorped his soul
[2:01:12] <%RealThiele> Ardbert is you
[2:01:12] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You could probably bring him out like in 5.3 though
[2:01:12] <RushUnplugged> he un-alived a bit
[2:01:15] <Torenology> I wish I was ardbert
[2:01:16] <%Monkeyweed21> like Ross from Friends
[2:01:21] <%valriot> I wish he'd hang out inside me
[2:01:21] <%MidnightBurst12> consumed
[2:01:22] <Ids560> yeah we have 1/13th more of our soul than everyone else
[2:01:22] <Grunkle_Dan_> its kind of hot tbh
[2:01:22] <%JoshManVGH> He made us dense!
[2:01:22] <heartlesshealer> He's Roxas now
[2:01:23] <penitentpendant> @shootbang_exe Terrible pun, good work!
[2:01:24] <%Alazull> We combined souls with him
[2:01:24] <+JustToWatch> Namekian fusion
[2:01:27] <%Axellogic> He gave us an ascian powerup
[2:01:27] <+MrWrann> Did he get "I have no mouth and I must scream"ed?
[2:01:27] <KonekoSilvertail> he chills with fray now. its all good.
[2:01:27] <HeroToxiko> THOU ART I
[2:01:28] <%Deft_Thought> Ardbert is... AMONGUS
[2:01:29] <ChinMusicTwo> ardbert is amongus
[2:01:29] <+BIumen> i mean he was already dead in HW
[2:01:30] <+iheartmota> kinda like Nail and Piccolo
[2:01:31] <%JohnAtDawn> I'm well aware, but why doesnt he speak up? We know he can, like in 5.3
[2:01:32] <%Dregon_Azure> we should go to the other shards and eat more souls
[2:01:36] <%kid_flashionable> we Are-dbert
[2:01:37] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:01:38] <%RealThiele> he left it to you
[2:01:39] <peachyprimrose> He's probably just taking a big sleep in our brain
[2:01:47] <+Havictos> @queequegtheater there might be some ardbert juice still in there
[2:01:48] <%JokerNewby> they let you dye the 90 gear after role quests
[2:01:49] <+Akizea> the ninja job gear is super sick too. im really happy with it
[2:01:51] <%NeonLight> except NIN
[2:01:51] <%watts121> That's actually why our WoL got a power boost, cuz we're rejoined 8 times over most people's 7
[2:01:52] <%Kiyosuki> My GNB is real close to getting that
[2:01:52] <@TheYellowcouch> yeah it's all really slick
[2:01:53] <rReizs> yiiss dapper gunbreaker gear
[2:02:03] <Ahack13> Eve if we didnt absorb him. Hes from another freakin dimension!
[2:02:04] <%Kiyosuki> and DRG, I'm stoked they both look great.
[2:02:04] <Grunkle_Dan_> my lvl 90 samurai skirt flies up when i ride rathalos and shows off my booty
[2:02:07] <+Akizea> @NeonLight lol you trippin
[2:02:27] <%watts121> NIN looks good on my Bunny Boi

[2:04:55] <Daxalog> Tiny Tank
[2:04:55] <@TheYellowcouch> other games exist?
[2:04:56] <penitentpendant> Thanks for saving MSQ progression for stream
[2:05:02] <penitentpendant> For those stuck in QueueWalker
[2:05:06] <%Kiyosuki> I don't know what the answer is but I bet its giant Cheese Borger
[2:05:07] <%watts121> ah I notice Pat also prefers the Shadowbringers relic without the crappy glowing bits.
[2:05:08] <+Solutha> Only the Bozjan earing 10% working in Bazja / Zadnor
[2:05:09] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah it's kinda terrifying, actually
[2:05:11] <%GallowsDrop> there's just so much to do
[2:05:12] <+Akizea> @KatabolicRage nvm i was wrong
[2:05:14] <Calamity2007> Hopefully this game has good post game content
[2:05:16] <+transporterthesequel> There are SIX jobs I need to unlock.
[2:05:23] <%croutonian> and we're finally gonna be back to a consistent patch schedule again thankfully
[2:05:47] <rosabellamelantha> no bozja doesn't take the earrings into account, dungeons ARE better if you get fast queue
[2:05:50] <Calamity2007> Pandamonium is not being released till later right?
[2:06:08] <ForlornHunter> Panda is in 2 weeks
[2:06:22] <tanarath> That's smart
[2:06:24] <%shootbang_exe> and yet dumbasses rush anyway
[2:06:25] <VioletRosefall> when is the first Alliance raid? till .5?
[2:06:27] <+MooseIsGoose> is that a freaking elephant spider
[2:06:31] <+transporterthesequel> It's a fucking banger, yeah
[2:06:31] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Are you gonna take a crack at Pandaemonium Savage?
[2:06:37] <ForlornHunter> They still rush though
[2:06:37] <peachyprimrose> It's so dire
[2:06:41] <Calamity2007> I have no interest in savage but normal I will love
[2:06:45] <%GallowsDrop> all of these creatures are so fucking GROSS
[2:06:45] <+Kalentan> oh my god somehow I didn't notice that. o.o
[2:06:46] <%Dakuu75> cursed as fuck, enemies
[2:06:58] <Grunkle_Dan_> my static cleared our first savage just last week
[2:06:59] <penitentpendant> It's a better design when you look at it from behind. Which can be hit or miss
[2:07:00] <haisho> oh yeah they're all cursed af
[2:07:01] <%Arweynn> i've seen something similar in aanother game but i don't remember where
[2:07:08] <%watts121> I got high hopes for Pandaemonium after the stinger
[2:07:11] <Calamity2007> @GallowsDrop And the fact that they were all people makes it worse
[2:07:20] <+Akizea> @VioletRosefall nah its 6.1
[2:07:30] <Treasure_Vault> So how do solo quests work if you're a squishy mage main?
[2:07:32] <%valriot> Could always prog it when gear is better n proper guides are out
[2:07:38] <Grunkle_Dan_> I just hope Panaemonium has its amazing theme. Pretty safe bet it does.
[2:07:45] <Saltmeisterr> What's pandemonium?
[2:07:53] <+transporterthesequel> @Treasure_Vault You blow it up before it kills you.
[2:07:53] <Grunkle_Dan_> raid
[2:07:53] <Calamity2007> @watts121 I just wonder if we will either wait till the end of it to deal with Laha or take him down like a bitch early on
[2:07:58] <+Havictos> we don't really know
[2:08:01] <ForlornHunter> The Raid 8 Mans
[2:08:03] <Calamity2007> @Saltmeisterr The alliance raid for this expansion
[2:08:06] <Sydin18> @Saltmeisterr Big final dungeon from ff2, getting turned into a raid
[2:08:14] <+Havictos> oh is it?
[2:08:19] <Calamity2007> Wait is Panda going to be alliance or 8 man?
[2:08:20] <haisho> Squishy mages aren't THAT squishy thankfully
[2:08:24] <VioletRosefall> @Akizea ah gotcha
[2:08:28] <+Havictos> nevermind me then
[2:08:28] <Saltmeisterr> ah
[2:08:30] <Grunkle_Dan_> its not the alliance raid is it? its 8 man
[2:08:40] <Calamity2007> Oh okay
[2:08:42] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Just beat EW wasn't expecting the gratuitous sex scene with Zenos at the end. A bold move by Squeenix
[2:08:46] <+RojanBo> Does this game allow for any mechanical expression?
[2:08:50] <ForlornHunter> Alliance raid is the Twelve apparently from media tour stuff awhile back
[2:08:50] <@QueequegTheater> @Grunkle_Dan_ There is no savage for Alliance raids
[2:08:51] <+Pleblu> Make the daytime stream a vod. Id watch it
[2:08:52] <%watts121> I'm just worried that queues aren't gonna get better, and playing when I have to go back to work will be impossible.
[2:08:56] <%NeonLight> alliance raid is about the twelve
[2:08:59] <@QueequegTheater> @RojanBo What do you mean?
[2:08:59] <Calamity2007> @AHomeschoolDropout Make love not war
[2:09:00] <%shootbang_exe> there are so many voice acted cutscenes this time around
[2:09:01] <ape_hawk> we're still only like 2/3 done with this, right?
[2:09:11] <%RealThiele> 2/3 LUL
[2:09:12] <%watts121> All weekend I logged in at 6am, but when I go back to work that's gonna be impossible.
[2:09:12] <Calamity2007> @NeonLight That would be great
[2:09:21] <SaltyAzteca> despair, my net is dying at the worst time
[2:09:27] <%JoshManVGH> Hey did they ever announce when HrothGals were coming?
[2:09:39] <%Axellogic> This also explains why the Ascians that did survive had such strong convictions cause the rest got despair'd
[2:09:39] <Warbot40> What happened to the Alchemist lady? She turn?
[2:09:47] <penitentpendant> @SaltyAzteca Don't transform! ...it makes it harder to hit your rotation
[2:09:47] <Calamity2007> I wish there was an option to have it so that it always does auto advance in voiced dialogues but not in non voiced
[2:09:49] <jorniev> blasphemers!?
[2:09:50] <Sydin18> @JoshManVGH later in the middle of the expansion from what it seems
[2:09:51] <+Havictos> sometime later as far as I know
[2:09:59] <+JustToWatch> MOON
[2:10:05] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Never played FF7, why were you guessing Jenovah in the past stream?
[2:10:06] <Zombrocom> THE MOON!
[2:10:06] <ape_hawk> KISS
[2:10:07] <+Havictos> the MOON
[2:10:08] <+MightyDuckShoes> @saltyazteca  Same NotLikeThis
[2:10:08] <42nfl19> omg stop that doomer talk,
[2:10:12] <%Kevlar_Caviar> uh oh
[2:10:14] <+Pleblu> Dang girl
[2:10:15] <jorniev> MOON!?
[2:10:15] <+wizard_of_diamonds> GIRL
[2:10:16] <+zuzuxiv> DONT BE A DOOMER
[2:10:17] <Blu_C> Kill her now.
[2:10:19] <+RojanBo> Like are you choosing how to do your moves and developing a style? Or are you more shooting for efficiency?
[2:10:20] <+Havictos> get her now!
[2:10:21] <KatabolicRage> doomer talk kills, literally
[2:10:22] <%watts121> 6.3 seems likely.
[2:10:24] <+slidshockingkrow> quick twist his head off
[2:10:25] <+wizard_of_diamonds> ...maybe sad's okay
[2:10:26] <ForlornHunter> That’s a cute au ra.
[2:10:28] <niko_fredman> LITERALLY DONT WORRY ABOUT IT
[2:10:28] <Calamity2007> @jorniev That's the in story name of the Terminal monsters the Final Days brings
[2:10:29] <%whyskeywolfe> ah bloo bla bloo
[2:10:31] <%JoshManVGH> Launch these peasants to the not at all depressing moon!
[2:10:33] <%Reilata> Sad is fine?
[2:10:36] <%cooldude69xx> QUICK. Death! That'll calm everyone
[2:10:36] <ape_hawk> crying isnt a panic attack
[2:10:37] <haisho> sad's okay it seems
[2:10:37] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AHomeschoolDropout will of the Planet bullshit is all over in FF7
[2:10:37] <SaltyAzteca> DOOMER TALK
[2:10:42] <cimturry> i guess its just fair
[2:10:42] <heartlesshealer> despair isn't fear
[2:10:44] <%Mr_Pylon> quick, do a magic trick
[2:10:45] <cimturry> fear*
[2:10:45] <@TheYellowcouch> it's not until it sets in
[2:10:45] <42nfl19> QUICK GIVE THEM THE WEED
[2:10:46] <+MrWrann> No, can't turn now even though everything done so far reasons she should. Story says no.
[2:10:46] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @ForlornHunter The female au ra models are cute as heck
[2:10:46] <+JustToWatch> Sorrow is not despair I guess
[2:10:48] <%MidnightBurst12> the beatings will continue until morale improves
[2:10:48] <xxshadowxx416> @PatStaresAt did tetsuya nomura write this
[2:10:48] <Blu_C> This calls for beer.
[2:10:50] <@TheYellowcouch> don't let it set in
[2:10:51] <%yendoria> You're allowed to be normally sad
[2:10:51] <+zuzuxiv> hell yeah matsya
[2:10:53] <penitentpendant> Despair spiral seems to require an initial transformation, it seems
[2:10:53] <+zuzuxiv> ily
[2:10:54] <Warbot40> FORGE AHEAD
[2:11:01] <%watts121> she's upset but not completely freaking out like the grandma
[2:11:01] <jorniev> SADNESS ISN'T DESPAIR
[2:11:05] <+ALazo> my friends, this is a wendy's
[2:11:05] <haisho> praise this chunky lad

[2:11:16] <ape_hawk> YEAH BUT THIS IS KINDA DIFFERENT, DUDE
[2:11:16] <42nfl19> TALK NO JUTSU
[2:11:19] <%RealThiele> jesus says no crying
[2:11:20] <%Monkeyweed21> Matsya is coming in with the save
[2:11:22] <+transporterthesequel> ...don't...kill god?
[2:11:24] <%Mantorok06> Elephant bro...
[2:11:25] <Calamity2007> I didn't watch it but what did Pat think of the moon rabbits?
[2:11:25] <peachyprimrose> He's sweet
[2:11:26] <+Havictos> you go tell 'em!
[2:11:28] <%watts121> oh no not the piano
[2:11:31] <+wizard_of_diamonds> The power of Talk it Out
[2:11:33] <%Kevlar_Caviar> hey what the fuck man
[2:11:38] <ape_hawk> horn lady is cute
[2:11:38] <jorniev> IS IT THAT DIFFERENT?
[2:11:40] <%solracc25> kinda hard to pray with the sky on fire
[2:11:43] <VioletRosefall> just summon Primals, problem solved
[2:11:47] <+MrWrann> Life sucks lmao
[2:11:50] <+Pleblu> "Life always sucks"
[2:11:50] <%NitronStreams> this stuff is like the opposite of the primals. you need to have faith to keep from turning.
[2:11:50] <ForlornHunter> Fucking Old Gods yeah that’ll help
[2:11:52] <jorniev> DRAGON!?
[2:11:53] <%RealThiele> Au Ra lady is p.cute
[2:11:53] <%canonness> man, I'm sad
[2:11:58] <peachyprimrose> Y'all hurry up and get to the good part because this ain't helping fjdmfnf
[2:11:58] <+REDtheBEAST> NotLikeThis BibleThump
[2:12:04] <%JohnAtDawn> This religion kinda sucks
[2:12:07] <42nfl19> BUT?
[2:12:12] <Calamity2007> @PatStaresAt Are you going to get all the aether currents before you beat the game or after?
[2:12:14] <%Reilata> Think about god. Don't summon! Just think.
[2:12:15] <%Kevlar_Caviar> JUST MAKE OUT ALREADY
[2:12:16] <SaltyAzteca> RUIN, HAS COME TO OUR FAMILY
[2:12:17] <cimturry> ngl life sucking ass and shit is pretty cool
[2:12:18] <KatabolicRage> I mean, it's helping aint it?
[2:12:21] <+natjen8> @JohnAtDawn its realistic at least
[2:12:21] <%RealThiele> this is like a warhammer religion
[2:12:24] <+Pleblu> "Stare at the horror"
[2:12:25] <karl_rex> Couldn't the remaining dragons of the First Brood create a primal equal to Zodiark? Just Tiamat was able to create Bahamut
[2:12:27] <%Mantorok06> BibleThump
[2:12:29] <+slidshockingkrow> have we considered doing drugs about it?
[2:12:36] <%legendfather_of_giants> THATS A GOOD LINE
[2:12:36] <Calamity2007> @JohnAtDawn I mean in a way I kind of like how it isn't trying to treat death as something that can be overcome
[2:12:41] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Defeat despair with the power of HATE
[2:12:47] <Daniel_Is_I> Fear is the mind-killer and all that.
[2:12:48] <42nfl19> no kith
[2:12:55] <+wizard_of_diamonds> And/or spite
[2:12:56] <@QueequegTheater> @RojanBo MMO gameplay is finding the highest DPS rotation and attempting to perfect adhere to it at all times
[2:12:56] <+transporterthesequel> so, DON'T kill god?
[2:12:57] <heartlesshealer> no-name lady got the good line
[2:12:58] <+zuzuxiv> god rewatching this makes me wanna cry
[2:13:04] <@QueequegTheater> There's no freestyling
[2:13:07] <%cooldude69xx> @wizard_of_diamonds Get mad! Dying sucks, why should you do it?
[2:13:08] <+Pleblu> Stare at the horror, the agony that is life. LOOK AT IT
[2:13:09] <penitentpendant> @wizard_of_diamonds Quick! Someone summon Doom Guy!
[2:13:13] <+JustToWatch> and then a big rock falls on them
[2:13:14] <cimturry> get sad so you can get HUGE
[2:13:14] <+EdgyOnPorpoise> Reason to live #1: Spite those who say you can't
[2:13:23] <%legendfather_of_giants> I mean there is freestyling, but those people are assholes
[2:13:25] <%MidnightBurst12> E D G E
[2:13:33] <+Havictos> @patstaresat gotta admit you're right.
[2:13:33] <%watts121> how could we lose hope with this hot bunny boi saving us?
[2:13:34] <+transporterthesequel> SAD LEADS TO GAINS
[2:13:40] <+slidshockingkrow> if you let Khorne into your heart, there's no room for despair!
[2:13:42] <+transporterthesequel> GET SAD GET BIG
[2:13:42] <%justcallmebobplease> You look like a Maple Story character that shops at Hot Topic.
[2:13:44] <%Reilata> @transporterthesequel Didn't killing god cause this in the first place?
[2:13:46] <ScrapSentinel> i am thoroughly enjoying playing a lalafell in these scenes
[2:13:47] <%Spawnbroker> WoL posing: "god I look so god damn cool right now"
[2:13:48] <$Pompadourius> Just don't be a freestyle SAM, for the love of god
[2:13:48] <peachyprimrose> LMAO the crunchy footsteps
[2:14:02] <%cooldude69xx> @transporterthesequel Killed the wrong god is all
[2:14:06] <+Pleblu> The ground was made of cheetos
[2:14:07] <+EdgyOnPorpoise> the sadder you are the easier it is to smack a bitch
[2:14:11] <ape_hawk> "yeah, you didnt create another freakout like last time"
[2:14:11] <haisho> Is that the Vatsapati fending gear?
[2:14:12] <%AHomeschoolDropout> It's probably a good thing that Garlemald guy shot himself else he would've probably turned into a boss or something
[2:14:20] <Warbot40> This guy reminds me of Runar
[2:14:20] <Daniel_Is_I> I REALLY like Matsya
[2:14:21] <%Monkeyweed21> doing this entire expansion in a playboy bunny costume sure hits different
[2:14:22] <@QueequegTheater> "Oh hey, I know that guy"
[2:14:24] <+slidshockingkrow> this boy is a top shelf boy
[2:14:25] <%NeonLight> God hes too good
[2:14:32] <42nfl19> so is it a range thing @PatStaresAt or can you transform at anytime and anywhere? What does running away do?
[2:14:37] <peachyprimrose> Matsya is too good for this world
[2:14:40] <@QueequegTheater> @Monkeyweed21 Gotta keep morale up somehow
[2:14:43] <+Havictos> @ahomeschooldropout oh yeah he would've been a problem with all this
[2:14:49] <+transporterthesequel> Fuck Matsya is goddamn great
[2:14:51] <rReizs> lot of temperamental hands trying to catch Cinder Surprise, the bastard
[2:14:54] <+MarkoTolstov> @AHomeschoolDropout the fact that someone shooting himself is a GOOD thing just shows how fucked up this situation is LUL
[2:15:03] <+MrWrann> Seek seek lest
[2:15:04] <peachyprimrose> @42nfl19 It seems to be brought on mostly by panic as opposed to just despair
[2:15:08] <+Solutha> booo hydaelyn
[2:15:09] <LunarRemix> Why is this so much louder than the rest of the dialogue
[2:15:11] <+Pleblu> Magic
[2:15:12] <Daniel_Is_I> :)
[2:15:12] <ForlornHunter> Where’s a Happiness Primal when you need one?
[2:15:13] <%afronooch> hmmmm
[2:15:15] <%Reilata> Just in case info?
[2:15:15] <@QueequegTheater> :)
[2:15:17] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i mean wasn't that the plan from the beginning
[2:15:20] <%JohnAtDawn> She believes in you BibleThump
[2:15:20] <%MelBrooksKA> It's fine
[2:15:20] <+R_BChe> :)
[2:15:21] <%AHomeschoolDropout> It gets explained
[2:15:21] <%JoshManVGH> I don't understand why this is so loud!
[2:15:21] <peachyprimrose> @LunarRemix Because mommy
[2:15:22] <+BIumen> wasnt it just a contingency
[2:15:23] <+MarkoTolstov> she's god, bro
[2:15:24] <penitentpendant> @42nfl19 It looks like a tuning fork resonance thing? Someone has to be really REALLY down. But once the first person transforms, it radiates outward.
[2:15:25] <%Spawnbroker> :)
[2:15:27] <%watts121> cuz she's a pri...Goddess with a capital G
[2:15:28] <peachyprimrose> What the fuck was that
[2:15:29] <heartlesshealer> :)
[2:15:30] <EndCrawler> :)
[2:15:31] <@TheYellowcouch> This really is just the extension of the drk job quests
[2:15:32] <+Havictos> @patstaresat she didn't know she planned for that way before we camile into the picture
[2:15:33] <%RealThiele> Nerrrrrd
[2:15:35] <%UvBenServed> Oh shit, Bigfoot
[2:15:35] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Is Hydalyn just Q
[2:15:41] <%NeonLight> wasnt that the goal back in ARR?
[2:15:42] <%Monkeyweed21> she's been prepping for Zodiarks possible death for 12,000 years with the Lopporits
[2:15:42] <@TheYellowcouch> in emotional theme at least lol
[2:15:42] <ape_hawk> another one
[2:15:42] <%blankwaffle> your twink bunny boy fits perfectly in final fantasy
[2:15:44] <Blu_C> When you go out in the woods today, you better go in disguise
[2:15:45] <+Havictos> @patstaresat came
[2:15:47] <dan_g_v> time for some monstah huntah
[2:15:49] <KatabolicRage> less resonate and more everone freaks out about the big monster that just appeared
[2:15:50] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Sorry, I mean is Hydalyn just Q-Anon
[2:15:50] <EndCrawler> i finished the story so i have a smiley certificate now :)
[2:15:54] <%MelBrooksKA> Yeah I saw, let just stand he and watch
[2:15:56] <karl_rex> So are Cid and Nero just not showing up?
[2:15:59] <Blu_C> When you go out in the woods today, prepare for a big surprise
[2:16:02] <%Reilata> LUL
[2:16:05] <Sydin18> Its the chest armor
[2:16:06] <peachyprimrose> The goggles look like hearts
[2:16:07] <+MrWrann> Soft face
[2:16:07] <%watts121> cuz the chin is masculine
[2:16:07] <%Deft_Thought> I wish this game pulled some Mortal Kombat shit and Hydaelyn started saying "ZODIARK MUST WIN"
[2:16:07] <+zuzuxiv> i like the helmet on honestly
[2:16:10] <%Buttlo> The way it frames your face.
[2:16:10] <%MidnightBurst12> hides the manly chin
[2:16:10] <heartlesshealer> framing
[2:16:11] <+R_BChe> cute femboi
[2:16:11] <Zourath> I mean, Hydalyn just seems to plan for every contingency. Like crystaline batman.
[2:16:11] <%legendfather_of_giants> it is
[2:16:12] <jubejube56> You can see the neck
[2:16:12] <Psyramics> chin strap?
[2:16:13] <%watts121> so when you cover it
[2:16:13] <+Angrec> softens the jaw
[2:16:14] <+MosesUnspoken> damn, she hot
[2:16:15] <%yendoria> It makes you face look rounder
[2:16:15] <cimturry> peggable
[2:16:16] <jubejube56> I think that's why
[2:16:17] <Blu_C> For ever a doom a doom there was is gathered together there because
[2:16:17] <penitentpendant> The helmet shadows accentuate his lack of cheek bones?
[2:16:17] <heartlesshealer> it's entirely framing
[2:16:17] <CryoByjorne> narrows your face maybe?
[2:16:18] <+Havictos> @karl_rex I've been wondering where they are
[2:16:18] <haisho> it hides the definition of your chin
[2:16:18] <%justcallmebobplease> It's framing in your jawline more narrowly
[2:16:19] <+Angrec> hides the jaw
[2:16:20] <@goose_attack_almanac> bunny boys are twunks.
[2:16:22] <+Pleblu> I straight up though it was a lady yes
[2:16:23] <%cooldude69xx> It de-emphasizes your penis
[2:16:23] <%canonness> the prettiest boys look like girls
[2:16:24] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt nah the helmet has a chinplate
[2:16:25] <Blu_C> today is the day that the doomers have their picknic.
[2:16:26] <%strakillias> Its cause it hides your jaw line
[2:16:26] <+zuzuxiv> femboy hooters
[2:16:27] <haisho> and jaw
[2:16:27] <peachyprimrose> Wrong Hooters, pat

[2:16:37] <%Cozy90> femboy hooters?
[2:16:38] <%Aeoneth> Chin Strap looks like it's hiding your chin and thus giving youa  more rounded face
[2:16:41] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> Hides the jawline I think
[2:16:47] <tanarath> Male Viera Hooters
[2:16:48] <KonekoSilvertail> bunboy hooters
[2:16:55] <%shootbang_exe> pat struggling to accept femboy status

[2:19:46] <haisho> Welcome to water tension. There's a reason high-altitude diving was at the Olympics
[2:19:47] <quigley_plays> Is there an inventory description for the baby?
[2:19:49] <%cvp5127> weak neck

[2:26:08] <%cephalon_nyt> tears man, super real
[2:26:10] <%whyskeywolfe> Not gonna lie that was better storytelling than just about anything I saw in 10 years of WoW.
[2:26:11] <haisho> it hurts because it's super relatable via Matsya
[2:26:11] <Saltmeisterr> GOD THIS GAME IS GOOD
[2:26:11] <+transporterthesequel> Seriously, I was in tears doing this, like, PLEASE, let me save at least this goddamn baby.
[2:26:14] <ammobasket> Shadowbringers taught us to be afraid for npcs
[2:26:15] <%Alazull> Daddy Vrtra
[2:26:16] <Psyramics> i played through this bit yesterday and I was still super tense
[2:26:19] <Calamity2007> I've never felt this dread and tense with a game in a long time
[2:26:19] <%kid_flashionable> I'm already in tears
[2:26:20] <17sevens> they kill off so many characters, the baby being saved isn't certain at all
[2:26:20] <peachyprimrose> Because Stardiver is bright as fuck, Alisaie
[2:26:25] <heartlesshealer> devs already showed they were unafraid to do horrendous story stuff, so it was real worry
[2:26:27] <%chiluzza> GOD ESTINIEN WHY YOU SO COOL
[2:26:27] <+EdgyOnPorpoise> Matsya's VA sold that super well!!
[2:26:42] <Bigbossman91> @ammobasket naw HW did that long before
[2:26:42] <Calamity2007> @chiluzza Character development
[2:26:43] <ArmadaGeddra> I had my head in my hands going No no no during this part.
[2:26:49] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt I did cry at that part
[2:26:51] <Grunkle_Dan_> Mayor Dragon, sounds great to me
[2:26:53] <%trancecarlito> Reverse Ishgard
[2:26:53] <$EsotericOdyssey> @EdgyOnPorpoise very relatable
[2:26:55] <%Reilata> Big hope dragon.
[2:26:56] <$EsotericOdyssey> just
[2:26:57] <%JoshManVGH> Oh thank dragon
[2:27:00] <cimturry> we need to get people hype as fuck
[2:27:03] <Vermillion129> Vrtra is such a good character
[2:27:05] <Sydin18> Our president is a cool, chill ass dragon? Hella
[2:27:05] <%RealThiele> id be super down with mayor dragon
[2:27:07] <$EsotericOdyssey> screaming and trying not to be scared
[2:27:07] <%AHomeschoolDropout> I think the bit that got me was the elephant man realizing he was turning and started freaking out more
[2:27:08] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt Matsya's VA deserves a raise for that scene
[2:27:12] <+ThomasOfTroy> I'm so confused, what happened to the moon being an ark? Is this still the apocalypse or weird side stuff?
[2:27:14] <%Dakuu75> Would be nice if SOMETHING finally went our way. (story wise)
[2:27:15] <+MrWrann> I wanted to see that baby turn into a little baby demon
[2:27:19] <+transporterthesequel> For real though
[2:27:22] <heartlesshealer> alaise can't swim
[2:27:23] <%Agami23> at least one person in the village has to be like "is it weird that i find our new dragon mayor hot?"
[2:27:29] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @ThomasOfTroy this is BIG apocalypse
[2:27:30] <+FinetiSonata> I wish my country was run by a nice dragon
[2:27:37] <%legendfather_of_giants> @heartlesshealer nah thats Alphinaud
[2:27:42] <jorniev> LOTS OF BURRYING PEOPLE IN THIS EXPANSION
[2:27:43] <Bigbossman91> @heartlesshealer yes she can
[2:27:46] <peachyprimrose> @Agami23 [ Dragonsong playing in the distance ]
[2:27:47] <%RealThiele> @ThomasOfTroy moons still an ark, we came back cause after big Z died final days were happening
[2:27:53] <%Nekros4442> @ThomasOfTroy the Moon is still the ark. What you're seeing is the reason that Ark is needed
[2:27:53] <dan_g_v> @heartlesshealer oh yeah, the twins couldn't swim before, no?
[2:27:54] <+transporterthesequel> Like HOW CAN YOU STOP PLAYING THIS GAME!?
[2:28:00] <Daniel_Is_I> It's really sad that it's literally better to DIE than to be turned
[2:28:01] <KnivesEve> yep
[2:28:01] <%Screwdatguy> Ignore the hollowing and its fineee
[2:28:03] <IntenseNerdRage> IM SWEATING AGAIN FROM HAVING RE WATCHED THIS SCENE AGAIN
[2:28:04] <%Alazull> That lady's neck got SNAPPED
[2:28:06] <+transporterthesequel> For the record, I didn't.....
[2:28:09] <heartlesshealer> @heartlesshealer I mix up the names, sorry
[2:28:17] <Grunkle_Dan_> theyre way easier in this expansion
[2:28:25] <%Nekros4442> oh thats what you were doin lol
[2:28:33] <@QueequegTheater> anti-content
[2:28:36] <Saltmeisterr> Jay Saighal is the name of Mastya's VA for those who want to know
[2:28:39] <Calamity2007> I got the aether currents in garlemald, not the moon yet
[2:28:43] <%Alazull> Bro for real
[2:28:45] <%RealThiele> just make Vel ferry you around
[2:28:49] <Daniel_Is_I> Sch set is really good
[2:28:55] <Calamity2007> The moon is kind ashitty to navigate
[2:28:56] <%GallowsDrop> This game will only get more and more tense btw
[2:29:01] <ape_hawk> is there another new map area after this?
[2:29:04] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah its good, actually
[2:29:04] <+Shikari21> clean
[2:29:04] <KnivesEve> nice
[2:29:04] <%ClericOfSparda> Looks good
[2:29:05] <%Kevlar_Caviar> DAMN
[2:29:06] <%GallowsDrop> SICK COAT
[2:29:07] <Grunkle_Dan_> it looks even better in red
[2:29:07] <penitentpendant> My friend likes the SCH set this expansion
[2:29:09] <%Mr_Pylon> fancy!
[2:29:10] <citerel> it looks too cool to be sch gear
[2:29:10] <Grunkle_Dan_> sucks on female
[2:29:11] <Daniel_Is_I> SCH got one of the best sets
[2:29:12] <%Nekros4442> yeah it's good
[2:29:12] <+transporterthesequel> the drip in the expac is INSANE
[2:29:13] <heartlesshealer> oooh
[2:29:13] <@QueequegTheater> 2 Wait how the
[2:29:13] <KnivesEve> i actually like it
[2:29:14] <+JustToWatch> Bloodborne Bunny
[2:29:14] <%JokerNewby> you can dye at 90
[2:29:15] <+Akizea> all of em look good
[2:29:15] <IntenseNerdRage> This expac has really used tension great
[2:29:16] <+Nomenanza> I really like how they approached artifact gear in this one
[2:29:17] <AllenDeadman> god DAMN that looks nice
[2:29:17] <%Kiyosuki> Scholar gear is one of the slickest looking I agree
[2:29:18] <%Solareon_> i was gonna lvl DRG next but maybe SCH is the move
[2:29:19] <%VioletHeart> Got that professor drip.
[2:29:20] <MKII> better than the ARR one for sure
[2:29:21] <+FinetiSonata> for like the first time ever
[2:29:21] <%MelBrooksKA> Look at all those frills
[2:29:22] <+MooseIsGoose> I love the black gold and red
[2:29:22] <luciluxlu0> so cool
[2:29:23] <+polothegreatest> SICK
[2:29:23] <penitentpendant> Gotta get the dyeable version
[2:29:25] <%Alazull> I mean technically the flying means the zone is "done"
[2:29:26] <%RealThiele> its all great
[2:29:26] <+razielhex> don't forget the tiny hat with it
[2:29:27] <%justcallmebobplease> LOOK AT THAT FOPPY BUNNY
[2:29:29] <Calamity2007> Man that is awesome. Shame I care not for Scholar
[2:29:29] <%Kiyosuki> Which is nice for once they always seem to get the short end of the stick with AF
[2:29:30] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Wait how tf do you preview more than one piece of gear?
[2:29:35] <jorniev> THIS EXPANSION IS THE DRIP EXPANSION
[2:29:38] <%Screwdatguy> They got some good style this expansion
[2:29:39] <+Solutha> they had to make it nice for once
[2:29:41] <%Agami23> its because its black and purple
[2:29:43] <%GallowsDrop> Scholars may not get cool buttons but they get COOL COAT
[2:29:50] <+ALazo> It's swallow's compass stuff
[2:29:51] <$Pompadourius> I've loved EVERY single reaper scythe so far, it's wild
[2:29:56] <+polothegreatest> Edgeworth gear
[2:30:00] <Vermillion129> @queequegtheater the fifth button
[2:30:05] <%Dakuu75> oh... good to know
[2:30:06] <@QueequegTheater> Oh that's what that does
[2:30:07] <Grunkle_Dan_> 50 days in this game and i didnt know about that...
[2:30:07] <+razielhex> Can you preview the fancy new coat with the tiny hat?
[2:30:07] <%ElkRiverDog> Whoever the gear designer for this expansion is IS ON FIRE
[2:30:08] <penitentpendant> It helps make glam sets without having to own the composite parts
[2:30:08] <KatabolicRage> that save delete button is not intuitively named it has to be said
[2:30:09] <Calamity2007> I need to see how the Zot gear looks like as a set
[2:30:11] <+Nomenanza> and once you turn it off you become naked again
[2:30:14] <+SeventhVice> @PatStaresAt can you show off the new summoner hotbar??
[2:30:16] <@QueequegTheater> NotLikeThis how have I not known this
[2:30:20] <%RealThiele> ooooh
[2:30:22] <+ALazo> hate getting cool gear that can only be used for 1 class. I don't have enough glamour slots to keep them separate like that
[2:30:23] <@QueequegTheater> I have like 1500 hours
[2:30:25] <MillaMoks> @PatStaresAt Don't examine folks gear if you can avoid it. EX weapons are already out and their names themselves are huge spoilers
[2:30:27] <%RealThiele> i didnt know either
[2:30:30] <+Havictos> @pompadourius the chainscythes are my favorite
[2:30:32] <%Kiyosuki> I dunno there's some AF designs that hit it out of the park but there's some duds too imo
[2:30:35] <Calamity2007> Because I would normally throw away the Zot gear since it is sub Augmented Cryptlurker
[2:30:39] <%Dakuu75> hey, was the map-view always there, when your using aethrites in town?
[2:30:42] <GandhiTheTerrible> gimme nuts
[2:30:43] <%Kiyosuki> Like the AST AF Feels hella phoned in to me
[2:30:43] <%MelBrooksKA> @QueequegTheater Git fashion gud
[2:30:52] <dan_g_v> awww yeah, nuts!
[2:30:59] <+blackjack45> hows war so far? reaper kind of reminds me of it
[2:30:59] <%Screwdatguy> Thats a p-boy summoner
[2:30:59] <+Nomenanza> oh god 3 lucid dreamings
[2:31:04] <penitentpendant> @QueequegTheater The old streamline of thought, don't look at buttons when initial thoughts only care about one part of the function
[2:31:06] <%RealThiele> level 86  for SMNis POPPIN
[2:31:08] <peachyprimrose> @Dakuu75 No, that was added with 6.0
[2:31:08] <%Nekros4442> Pat doesnt have the big boys unlocked yet
[2:31:09] <Calamity2007> @Kiyosuki As there always are. As long as the end game sets are good looking I don't mind
[2:31:09] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Dakuu75 no thats new
[2:31:10] <zhukis> ...are those all the buttons?
[2:31:14] <Daxalog> Oh. Other classes have to do the switch thing too?
[2:31:19] <+Solutha> minihamut
[2:31:21] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @MillaMoks ffxiv team try not to name gear after huge spoilers challenge minute 1
[2:31:22] <%kid_flashionable> oooh pretty
[2:31:22] <+transporterthesequel> PFFT straight into BAHAMUT
[2:31:24] <%EynoStiles> @patstaresat Is that a tiny bulldog?
[2:31:26] <@QueequegTheater> @MelBrooksKA I'm really bad at fashion I usually just wear full sets because I can't make anything that looks good and it makes me feel self conscious FeelsBadMan
[2:31:28] <Ids560> hey grandpa
[2:31:41] <Calamity2007> I shouid pay more attention to sets that aren't just a blue or purple background
[2:31:41] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:31:45] <%RealThiele> also for those that play SMN /petsize can adjust your bois
[2:31:46] <%Screwdatguy> That looks so slick damn
[2:31:51] <@QueequegTheater> @EynoStiles Yes
[2:31:52] <%JoshManVGH> @zhukis For Summoner you mean?
[2:32:05] <+Nomenanza> nugget rage
[2:32:08] <+MarkoTolstov> i really wish i could petglam the carbuncles into full sized primals and not the egis. I wanna ball around town with Ifrit
[2:32:11] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt what's the best way to get company seals? (if I don't wanna craft)
[2:32:13] <+zuzuxiv> I levelled SMN to 90, I personally prefer ShB SMN over this one :(
[2:32:17] <dan_g_v> you need to say badadaba badadaba TITAN!
[2:32:18] <zhukis> @JoshManVGH Yup
[2:32:19] <ForlornHunter> Lvl 90 Smn is what I originally thought the class was gonna be like when I started originally
[2:32:19] <Vermillion129> Always set pet size to maximum Kappa
[2:32:19] <MrMagicConch> Just started Dark Knight today
[2:32:20] <%cooldude69xx> @QueequegTheater There should be a Band T-Shirt+Jeans glam combo for us fashionless
[2:32:20] <%Monkeyweed21> 86 is a big pop off for SMN
[2:32:26] <%ClericOfSparda> @QueequegTheater Honestly I mainly just use Facebook groups and that Eorzean fashion site to make glams
[2:32:27] <%Kiyosuki> I feel like WHM Af could have been better too and I'm iffy on NIN and MNK. Rest look great though.
[2:32:34] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Dakuu75 buy turnins off the MB
[2:32:42] <+Shikari21> @Kiyosuki I love my NIN
[2:32:43] <+SeventhVice> cool
[2:32:44] <%Nekros4442> @PatStaresAt Every Titan slap replenishes Astral Flow. Unless that's a level 90 thing
[2:32:45] <%Kiyosuki> The SMN AF is awesome I agree.
[2:32:45] <+blastazoid00> looks really simple
[2:32:46] <%Agami23> i should really level up summoner
[2:32:47] <%JoshManVGH> 86 is amazing for SMN, it's so damn good
[2:32:49] <$Pompadourius> I wanna wear the RPR 90 so bad but as a catgirl, the tail clipping through the cape sucks.
[2:32:49] <TranquiloArman> @PatStaresAt Would you say Summoner is more streamlined now?
[2:32:53] <+Shikari21> NIN feels amazing to play
[2:33:00] <%Kiyosuki> I get what the appeal for the NIN AF could be
[2:33:06] <Sydin18> I need to try Black Mage since enochian is a passive now
[2:33:07] <%RealThiele> 86 makes the rotation feel very complete
[2:33:14] <%Kiyosuki> I'm like on the fence about it.
[2:33:15] <%watts121> 86 and 90 are the big
[2:33:17] <%silentblast93> pat what's the exp of 89 to 90?
[2:33:19] <+Solutha> its a ogcd weave
[2:33:20] <%Logoth_> heh, flow.
[2:33:30] <%Dakuu75> @legendfather_of_giants I'm embarrassed I didn't think of that. Cheers~
[2:33:32] <+Shikari21> i think the NIN af gear looks the best on Bun boys
[2:33:33] <Calamity2007> Not really a spoiler but I love how the achievement names for MSQ progress in this expansion are the lyrics to the Sharliyan theme
[2:33:34] <%Nekros4442> It's the ogcd weave for Titan rotation
[2:33:37] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat at 86 titan will be throw rocks followed by clap rocks
[2:33:39] <Vermillion129> @silentblast93 10m
[2:33:41] <ape_hawk> ass flow
[2:33:42] <+zuzuxiv> @PatStaresAt they meant every time you use gemshine during titan, it refreshes astral flow at 86
[2:33:44] <%RealThiele> im 90 ill go check
[2:33:46] <+zuzuxiv> so you can spam slaps
[2:33:58] <+Solutha> yes u weave mountain buster
[2:33:58] <%Kiyosuki> Yeah the NIN mask is my least favorite part of it so maybe without it the outfit is better
[2:33:59] <%Nekros4442> ah it's 86
[2:34:01] <%Nekros4442> my apologies
[2:34:09] <penitentpendant> SMN has the problem that it triggers a lot of buffs you don't have the tooltips for
[2:34:10] <%JoshManVGH> 86 IS SO GOOD
[2:34:11] <rReizs> you also need it on your hotbar so you can deathflare during bahamut
[2:34:15] <+zuzuxiv> @PatStaresAt meaning everytime you use Topaz Rite, you get a Mountain Buster
[2:34:15] <Daxalog> Wait. Summoner gets 4 new skill each tier? What the hell man.
[2:34:20] <%watts121> at 86 Ifrit gets gap closer, Titan gets OGCD between all his spells, and Garuda gets ground AOE
[2:34:20] <dan_g_v> so is that disguistingly good?
[2:34:21] <%Dakuu75> FFXI had such better summons. here they all look like elementals
[2:34:23] <MKII> it's crazy
[2:34:28] <+Figleafplays> christ there are so many buttons for summoner
[2:34:30] <+MarkoTolstov> The ShB tomestones convert to Poetics, right? What should I spend those on to avoid capping?
[2:34:32] <+Nomenanza> hell ye the controller jump spin
[2:34:34] <+Akizea> @Kiyosuki same, i just dont wear the mask
[2:34:35] <citerel> does that mean titan phase becomes like another phoenix
[2:34:37] <penitentpendant> One of those classes you can't really read on paper and have to feel
[2:34:39] <%JoshManVGH> Ifirits astral flow is a two button combo
[2:34:40] <%EynoStiles> Do you have sage yet?
[2:34:44] <%Kevlar_Caviar> NICE
[2:34:48] <%watts121> at 90 your spells become the flashiest in the entier game
[2:34:49] <%RealThiele> titan becomes slap slap clap clap
[2:34:50] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt OH~! well that's ok then
[2:34:51] <%kid_flashionable> wowie zowie
[2:34:52] <Daniel_Is_I> They become the real summons and BLOCK OUT YOUR PARTY'S VIEW
[2:35:02] <%Dakuu75> dope
[2:35:06] <@QueequegTheater> You will never take my Chicken Nugget Titan away from me
[2:35:08] <%watts121> damn Soken and his sad piano
[2:35:10] <%trancecarlito> BibleThump BibleThump
[2:35:11] <%Alazull> It is
[2:35:20] <%RealThiele> @Daniel_Is_I you can adjust their size for yourself
[2:35:24] <%Dakuu75> fuck the party. I wanna see shiva's ass all over my camera
[2:35:26] <%Alazull> There's a lot of nice buttons to touch on SMN
[2:35:28] <MKII> they look like babies
[2:35:31] <+zuzuxiv> I actually dont know, I prefer my summons BIG
[2:35:33] <%Chichen> ye
[2:35:34] <%Aeoneth> @QueequegTheater Now you can have eternaL NUGGET
[2:35:37] <%SveriSageAdvice> YES
[2:35:37] <+Solutha> prob
[2:35:38] <penitentpendant> You can glam the small ones
[2:35:38] <MKII> they are carbuncle sized primals
[2:35:40] <%JoshManVGH> Not sure yet.
[2:35:43] <%watts121> the real problem is their effects are still big
[2:35:44] <penitentpendant> I have nugget up 24/7
[2:35:46] <%Chichen> i believe so
[2:35:46] <+the22cstomp> YES
[2:35:47] <%VioletHeart> When do we get the option to make the summons twice as big?
[2:35:49] <%LeiaSkynoober> I dunno, I summon a ton of different Carbuncles myself
[2:35:50] <%RealThiele> theya re small
[2:35:51] <%Alazull> The fact you saved even one of that family is a miracle
[2:35:51] <%Aeoneth> EGIs are glams for carbie
[2:35:51] <+MarkoTolstov> i'm sure /petsize Ifrit small is a command
[2:35:53] <%RealThiele> YES
[2:35:55] <%Kiyosuki> Like I said earlier GNB and DRG AF look incredible, glad I'm taking them up to 90 first.
[2:35:57] <dan_g_v> Tinyfrit?
[2:35:59] <%watts121> like the attack itself is still huge like a boss move
[2:36:01] <+zuzuxiv> Tiny Titan
[2:36:03] <%RealThiele> smol titan
[2:36:03] <+zuzuxiv> :^)
[2:36:04] <haisho> I might have to play Summoner to see it for myself
[2:36:05] <%silentblast93> hey is it me or dose the Almaty  serge coat of aiming look like the shirer chest piece?
[2:36:08] <%Screwdatguy> Hey, this game might be good!
[2:36:09] <+the22cstomp> little ifrit gnawing at your ankles
[2:36:11] <MKII> I had to change it to small because large was unplayable
[2:36:15] <haisho> but I'm at like 50
[2:36:17] <%Dakuu75> so you can choose the big or mini version summon?
[2:36:18] <$EsotericOdyssey> this fucking PIANO
[2:36:19] <%Kiyosuki> I really love how Summoner really might as well be the third new job lol
[2:36:23] <Warbot40> Wish we could glam to other summons outside the 3 in ARR
[2:36:24] <$EsotericOdyssey> it TEARS my HEART out
[2:36:30] <penitentpendant> @silentblast93 They reuse a lot of previous set models
[2:36:32] <%Monkeyweed21> Titan becomes like miqote size or some shit
[2:36:32] <dan_g_v> I'm sure fur sites will have a blast with this idea
[2:36:33] <%watts121> large got me killed during Trial 2
[2:36:35] <%RealThiele> its  /petsize "Rube ifriit" small
[2:36:39] <Zourath> Ittybittybit ittybittybit ittybittybit titan!
[2:36:39] <%RealThiele> err ruby
[2:36:49] <ForlornHunter> I always make my summons large. Vision be damned
[2:36:53] <%Aeoneth> @silentblast93 Probably is.  A lot of the crafted stuff is recolours.  86 Gear is a recolor of Neo ishgard for tanks for ex
[2:36:54] <dan_g_v> @Zourath good one X3
[2:37:02] <peachyprimrose> THE MUSIC CUT LMAO
[2:37:31] <Vermillion129> Oh hey elephant lady how u doing
[2:37:38] <%trancecarlito> What do Indian people think about this zone?
[2:37:42] <%Kiyosuki> I'm not complaining about the Skallic armor recolors at least
[2:37:54] <%Dakuu75> these guys should be a new race we can be
[2:38:04] <dan_g_v> yeah, scientists focused on working sound like a good choice to not turn to despair
[2:38:16] <penitentpendant> "We guessed like 80% of it."
[2:38:17] <%RealThiele> live boy uh oh
[2:38:19] <%ClericOfSparda> 2 hours to login. GDI
[2:38:37] <penitentpendant> "That last 20% is cool though."
[2:38:37] <$EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt the elephant people fuckin' rock I love 'em
[2:38:56] <%Kiyosuki> yeah the Elephant people are pretty awesome.
[2:39:00] <penitentpendant> @EsotericOdyssey I look forward to their Beast Tribe quests
[2:39:12] <%Dakuu75> they remind me of the big yetti dudes from Samurai Jack
[2:39:22] <%watts121> are they the best tribe, or the moon rabbits?
[2:39:37] <%watts121> cuz they don't seem "beast tribey" they seem like normal citizens
[2:39:39] <%cooldude69xx> @Dakuu75 The jump good guys?
[2:39:39] <quigley_plays> Both will be
[2:39:46] <@QueequegTheater> @watts121 both
[2:39:47] <dan_g_v> ah, the drink huh
[2:39:48] <Vermillion129> Playable matanga when square Kappa
[2:39:48] <penitentpendant> @watts121 Their are multiple tribes per expansion
[2:39:50] <ForlornHunter> We have Both anti primal scales and a cure for tempering, they’ve really made primals a non-issue it feels like at least.
[2:40:06] <%ClericOfSparda> Well, we killed a god and destroyed the aetheric balance on this planet, which may cause an apocalypse.
[2:40:07] <%Reilata> Mm chai.
[2:40:13] <%Dakuu75> @cooldude69xx Nah, the other guys. they looked like woolie mammoth and got enslaved by the little blue guys
[2:40:15] <sullivansbizarreadventure> So what’d I miss?
[2:40:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> Chai tea
[2:40:25] <%shootbang_exe> mmmm tea
[2:40:30] <@QueequegTheater> @ClericOfSparda "But I also made these coffee biscuits for you"
[2:40:30] <$Pompadourius> God, remember when the biggest threat was "We gotta make a feast and go fight Titan"? How times have changed.
[2:40:32] <%ElkRiverDog> Now I'm jealous
[2:40:32] <Calamity2007> Add that to the cookbook
[2:40:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> Are you gonna Dumb bunny starbucks
[2:40:36] <%Kiyosuki> Well "Beast Tribe" seems pretty flexible a term, like how the Dwarves were considered one one the first
[2:40:37] <dan_g_v> so, we stop for now?
[2:40:38] <%Aeoneth> @ForlornHunter tbf they've also upped the scales for primals too with Sin Eaters and now these Things
[2:40:40] <TrollKing96> @Dakuu75 The Woolies.
[2:40:53] <goosematty> WOOOOO
[2:41:01] <$EsotericOdyssey> if the problem is bad vibes giving people nice drinks isn't a terrible way to address it
[2:41:05] <%ClericOfSparda> @QueequegTheater LUL
[2:41:05] <penitentpendant> @Pompadourius Now we fight godless monstrosities, THEN feast
[2:41:11] <@QueequegTheater> @ForlornHunter Sin Eaters weren't primals
[2:41:17] <@QueequegTheater> The last primal was Shinryu
[2:41:19] <haisho> Sit down and drink your damn chai!
[2:41:31] <%cooldude69xx> @Dakuu75 Right, I remember now. God that show was good
[2:41:32] <$EsotericOdyssey> Sin Eaters were like, basically the same problem as tempered people
[2:41:34] <$EsotericOdyssey> just uh
[2:41:36] <$EsotericOdyssey> advanced
[2:41:45] <$Pompadourius> @penitentpendant Hell yeah
[2:41:47] <KatabolicRage> sin eaters were closer to voidsent than anything else
[2:41:48] <%Dakuu75> Anima should've been a primal *pouts*
[2:41:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> pat almost got his leg snapped
[2:42:11] <@QueequegTheater> @Dakuu75 No, the three trials all deserve the spots more
[2:42:18] <@QueequegTheater> trust me
[2:42:31] <@TheYellowcouch> Couldn't agree more
[2:42:36] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Dakuu75 they they're all way better than Anima
[2:42:42] <%cvp5127> just make a new baby
[2:42:44] <AllenDeadman> the very definition of shit's fucked
[2:42:45] <AllenDeadman> to the max
[2:42:47] <+transporterthesequel> Queequeg is CORRECT
[2:42:48] <$Pompadourius> I'm gonna say that if the 83 trial is what it was and they're only going to UP THE ANTE from there? Anima can go, if the other trials are even more severe.
[2:43:02] <+transporterthesequel> Also, keep in mind, that child is STILL AN ORPHAN
[2:43:04] <%shootbang_exe> saw someone in shout chat saying the tonal whiplash is wild in this expac and someone immediately replied with "this dude never played a yakuza game"
[2:43:07] <+transporterthesequel> It's STILL awful!
[2:43:16] <AllenDeadman> maybe
[2:43:20] <quigley_plays> until someone has a panic attack
[2:43:21] <+BIumen> that would be like the angry birds movie plot
[2:43:25] <%ClericOfSparda> LUL good comparison
[2:43:33] <%RocketBarrel> but everyone feel sad sometimes
[2:43:37] <AllenDeadman> and the moment one panic outburts happens
[2:43:38] <%Kiyosuki> Its so funny to think that one day the 83 trial is gonna be seen as the Titania of Endwalker
[2:43:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> @shootbang_exe Its true
[2:43:41] <+Edrem> or we psychopass it, and kill anyone that gets a bit sad LUL
[2:43:42] <@QueequegTheater> But you're fighting against the concept of sadness
[2:43:42] <%Alazull> Ain't nobody on this island not having a rough day
[2:43:42] <rReizs> shoulda just shouted "SUNAONI I LOVE YOU
[2:43:43] <AllenDeadman> shit can go sideways
[2:43:52] <+solomonpun> The issue is keeping things under control until the heroes and figure out how to fix the issue permenantly.
[2:43:53] <%cooldude69xx> @shootbang_exe He aint wrong tho
[2:43:54] <$Pompadourius> This final days shit makes the sin eaters look like puppies and kittens by comparison. Good god.
[2:43:56] <%Alazull> @RocketBarrel You can feel sad, but it's giving in to despair
[2:43:59] <+solomonpun> can* figure
[2:43:59] <@QueequegTheater> Oh yeah, this is how PsychoPass happens
[2:44:01] <%Cozy90> This is like 1 step away from a berserk crossover
[2:44:10] <%Dakuu75> Stream title should've been "Pat sads at Endwalker"
[2:44:18] <haisho> oh man how fast would Alisae turn if a Tesleen moment happened HERE
[2:44:52] <+transporterthesequel> Yes they are the tippy top tier
[2:44:56] <Daniel_Is_I> I ended up liking Thavnair way more than I expected
[2:44:58] <Warbot40> I would still like Anima getting some higher end battle in like a raid or something. I was really looking forward to anima so It's a little dissapointing that it's just a dungeon boss.
[2:45:07] <+zuzuxiv> awww mastya...
[2:45:13] <+zuzuxiv> >mastya
[2:45:19] <cimturry> elephant dads pog
[2:45:24] <BreakfastSampler> @haisho would have if it didn't already happen. past suffering is current strength
[2:45:25] <+transporterthesequel> @QueequegTheater whisper me how far are you so I don't spoil you.
[2:45:28] <OmegaWeltall> yea this part is fuggen rough man BibleThump
[2:45:30] <%watts121> now have lil elephant babies to be siblings with your adopted human daughter
[2:45:56] <$Pompadourius> That baby they saved is gonna grow up to be an anime protagonist guaranteed
[2:46:00] <+Solutha> yeh the intro to thav felt lackin and then this was amazing
[2:46:04] <%Alazull> The fact that dude is just like, yeah, I'm adopting her is awesome
[2:46:15] <%Alazull> That kid gets to grow up with cool elephant parents now
[2:46:18] <+transporterthesequel> They SOLVED TEMPERING
[2:46:21] <SaltyAzteca> the cooler elcor
[2:46:25] <%Divryne> Second trial is fucking dope yo.
[2:46:32] <%Dakuu75> is it hard to change your chocobo mount's color?
[2:46:32] <haisho> have to say the set-up for escalation in this place was done WELL
[2:46:39] <+Ryaotz> Shame you can't be any of the beastmen
[2:46:43] <$Sasha_conyst> oh Pat playing a Bun
[2:46:47] <penitentpendant> I'mma guess they'll be the 'combat beast tribe'. Although I suppose they could be the gatherers?
[2:46:49] <Calamity2007> So are they or the moon rabbits going to be the crafting race?
[2:46:50] <+Havictos> @transporterthesequel no alisae did
[2:46:54] <+vaderxyz1970> Why be tempered when you can drink some delicious chi tea
[2:46:54] <+Ryaotz> I wanna be an elephant man
[2:46:55] <%watts121> @Solutha I love how Zodiark is just the first arc. Like oh the dark god we've built up as the greatest evil? Yeah he's nothing
[2:46:56] <penitentpendant> Hmm
[2:46:57] <%livlinn> 🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘🐘
[2:47:05] <Vermillion129> @dakuu75 not hard but need some gil and planning
[2:47:05] <jorniev> that kid is gonna grow up to show up in an expansion
[2:47:12] <tanarath> I can't believe that the hunt mount us JUST Zangief
[2:47:12] <$Pompadourius> EW has been masterful about setup, tension building and release. As long as you're okay with a slow build-up at the start of the expac anyway.
[2:47:26] <Vermillion129> Cos you need to buy certain food and feed it in certain order
[2:47:31] <+transporterthesequel> She did half, the Raz alchemists solved the ability to not get tempered in the first place.
[2:47:31] <%Solareon_> @PatStaresAt how much longer you thinking about going. I knew you said you might stream today, but wasnt sure
[2:47:33] <%shootbang_exe> weather: apocalypse
[2:47:36] <ammobasket> "if you think Zodiark is Evil, take a look at what we made him to fight!"
[2:47:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> THAT KID GROWS UP TO BE LIGHTNING
[2:47:37] <Vermillion129> And some of them are expensive
[2:47:41] <haisho> I didn't see what the hunt mount is. Is it an imperial Pugnax?
[2:47:41] <jorniev> the monsters are attracted to fear too?
[2:47:44] <penitentpendant> (He's the Azure Dragoon!)
[2:47:53] <%watts121> and hiding the true depth of the story, like I remember people saying they revealed everything in the launch trailer...they didn't reveal shit
[2:47:53] <dan_g_v> kinda crazy how we went from wacky frog shenanigans to this
[2:48:11] <%Dakuu75> @Vermillion129 what's "expensive" in this context?
[2:48:22] <$Pompadourius> I almost get the vibe that they decided to put all the funny meme stuff at the start because they knew it'd get real dire in the latter half.
[2:48:23] <%MelBrooksKA> Jesus Alphinaud and Alisas are smol compared to the others
[2:48:27] <+transporterthesequel> Nightmare
[2:48:28] <Therusher> Not good
[2:48:28] <%trancecarlito> 4k
[2:48:29] <+Shikari21> 2.5k on Faerie
[2:48:29] <+Nomenanza> the weather type is hype
[2:48:31] <penitentpendant> 6437
[2:48:32] <Jackalope322> lmao imagine not being in game
[2:48:32] <%watts121> my server's queue is 5000 right now
[2:48:33] <%livlinn> Omg lil chokobo
[2:48:33] <%GallowsDrop> bad I assume
[2:48:33] <+Shikari21> started at 5k
[2:48:33] <%ClericOfSparda> It took me 2 hrs to get into Lamia
[2:48:34] <%Gasgrave> 1726 for me now
[2:48:34] <+blastazoid00> shit
[2:48:34] <@QueequegTheater> At 1025
[2:48:35] <$Pompadourius> I'm in queue 2219 on Hyperion right now
[2:48:35] <%Agami23> its slightly better, but still long
[2:48:38] <penitentpendant> So I'll be here for 2 hours
[2:48:39] <+fishmonger555> im at 1932, got DC'd about 2 hours ago
[2:48:39] <%shootbang_exe> ssaryn strugglin with the queue rn
[2:48:39] <+natjen8> 5.4k on gilgamesh
[2:48:40] <haisho> I just want to know what's gonna be the gil-sink mount
[2:48:41] <jorniev> WALKING IN THE END
[2:48:42] <StrangeCoincidence> how is endwalker so far?
[2:48:42] <TranquiloArman> over 4000 for me. I wanna cry
[2:48:43] <Sydin18> 2000+ On midgarsormr :>
[2:48:44] <+transporterthesequel> 4.8k as of 30 minutes ago on Sarg
[2:48:45] <%watts121> I don't even try to log in
[2:48:50] <Psyramics> coming up on 4 hours trying to get in
[2:48:51] <+Solutha> i now understand why the put the silly disney bunnies after zodiark b4 this lmao
[2:48:53] <haisho> sitting at 2.5k
[2:48:59] <%Agami23> mine was at about 4800, and its going relatively fast
[2:49:05] <jorniev> 4.8K!?!?
[2:49:06] <ammobasket> was around 3k on Mateus, got kicked twice so far. 827 now
[2:49:07] <+transporterthesequel> Endwalker is the best expansion. Of anything. Ever.
[2:49:10] <$Pompadourius> It's wild. The game runs like a dream when you're inside, the queue is just nightmarish.
[2:49:10] <%watts121> @Solutha they do that to release tension
[2:49:14] <%Kiyosuki> its a pallete cleanser
[2:49:16] <Calamity2007> What is happening?
[2:49:29] <%watts121> he's probably pissing
[2:49:34] <%Kiyosuki> too much doom and gloom all at once without a break leads to acid reflux
[2:49:34] <Calamity2007> @Pompadourius the monkey's paw. Then again I think I would rather have this than the other way around
[2:49:36] <Therusher> I keep getting to 2-3k or so, then get 2002 error chained to the back of the queue
[2:49:48] <%Agami23> @jorniev yeah but its only been like 30 minutes and im down to 2.9k
[2:49:51] <ArkSeaside> @PatStaresAt thanks for the assist, lol
[2:49:53] <Therusher> At least they're comping everyone a few days though
[2:50:10] <%watts121> good story pacing has drops in the tension so we don't become desensitized to the drama
[2:50:18] <%watts121> EW is paced really well.
[2:50:20] <$Pompadourius> @Calamity2007 Oh, for sure. And as long as I don't disconnect, I don't mind a long queue, I can do other things while I wait too.
[2:50:21] <haisho> my dumb decision to make a character on the US server despite being on the other side of the world is paying off
[2:50:22] <ForlornHunter> I really like how Endwalker acknowledges the players time that is put into side content and jobs in context to the side characters that show up
[2:50:27] <Vermillion129> @dakuu75 depend on the server marketboard but when i did it some time ago it was about 200k total?
[2:50:41] <%VioletHeart> I tapped out for a sec and everyone's talking about queues. Did Pat DC and have to requeue?
[2:50:51] <Vermillion129> Im in elemental tho so price is usually low
[2:50:59] <$Pompadourius> @VioletHeart Nah, he's taking a piss but asked how everyone's queue is
[2:51:01] <Therusher> @VioletHeart nah he just asked about them then went for a bio break
[2:51:01] <penitentpendant> @ForlornHunter Had a friend not have certain classes to 80. We compared and contrasted who showed up in the 83 cutscenes.
[2:51:03] <+Havictos> just asking how they were
[2:51:08] <%Dakuu75> @Vermillion129 oh, yeah that's a bit but, I was expecting much worse
[2:51:10] <haisho> nah he asked how everyone's queue was doing then he went to pee
[2:51:14] <%VioletHeart> Ah fair. Neat.
[2:51:18] <%snugglepuggs> Endwalker legitimately feels like a stand-alone game gameplay wise
[2:51:39] <xxshadowxx416> was in queue for most of the podcast
[2:51:43] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I logged out right at the 90 trial and can't get back in LET ME IN LET ME IN LET ME INNNNNNNNN
[2:51:50] <%shurtal> any revelaitons?
[2:51:53] <ForlornHunter> @penitentpendant any changes?
[2:51:53] <Blu_C> "succeeded"
[2:51:54] <$Pompadourius> I've had only one disconnect while inside the game since EW dropped, and I got back in with a queue of like 20, so that's good at least.
[2:51:54] <Blu_C> Yes.
[2:51:58] <Blu_C> That is what I saw happen too
[2:52:00] <artoflec> i really am curious where the hell this is all going
[2:52:00] <Vermillion129> @queequegtheater F
[2:52:07] <wolverinewaswrong> ominous
[2:52:10] <+Nomenanza> @QueequegTheater boy that is very unfortunate
[2:52:11] <haisho> OOF
[2:52:14] <@QueequegTheater> IT WAS 5 AM I HAD TO SLEEP
[2:52:15] <%shurtal> @QueequegTheater RIP
[2:52:15] <%watts121> A bit, but it is the culmination of nearly all the older storylines.
[2:52:21] <@goose_attack_almanac> Wizard of Oz, but the wizard is a fuckin dragon
[2:52:28] <haisho> Big Fs for Queequeg
[2:52:37] <penitentpendant> @ForlornHunter Certain NPCs aren't there. BRD NPCs were there for him during the big powow cutscene. Neither of us could find the PLD NPCs
[2:52:38] <$Pompadourius> We doing Ishgard 2?
[2:52:39] <+JustToWatch> @PatStaresAt did you see the "review" of endwalker that Gene retweeted?
[2:52:41] <+transporterthesequel> yeah, rip
[2:52:45] <ForlornHunter> @queequegtheater Sleep is for the weak
[2:52:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @goose_attack_almanac so the opposite of the wizard of oz?
[2:52:48] <tanarath> @queequegtheater that's why you log off at 12 & wake up at 6
[2:52:49] <%watts121> I'm glad I didnt try to stay up last night and finish. I got up at 8am this morning and the last zone took me until 1pm
[2:52:58] <%trancecarlito> @penitentpendant no one wants them
[2:53:03] <penitentpendant> Keep him spoiler free
[2:53:04] <+Havictos> @queequegtheater you're weak queequg
[2:53:11] <%JoshManVGH> Also reviews can have big spoilers
[2:53:12] <$Pompadourius> I ain't looking up a single EW-related thing until I'm done. lol
[2:53:17] <+transporterthesequel> @QueequegTheater That's why you 5d chess and wake UP at 4am
[2:53:18] <+JustToWatch> "how's endwalker" i feel like a medieval peasant who's been given a cool ranch dorito
[2:53:18] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt "how's endwalker" i feel like a medieval peasant who's been given a cool ranch dorito
[2:53:23] <@QueequegTheater> That's the tweet
[2:53:24] <Calamity2007> @PatStaresAt What did you think of the moon rabbits
[2:53:37] <xxshadowxx416> just got a healer how ask me first time tanking first time in that boss
[2:53:37] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah
[2:53:38] <+Shikari21> true
[2:53:39] <$Pompadourius> LUL
[2:53:40] <%yendoria> So poisoned?
[2:53:42] <+transporterthesequel> No that tracks
[2:53:42] <$Pompadourius> IT MEANS IT'S GOOD
[2:53:43] <+Akizea> mind blown is what it means
[2:53:45] <VioletRosefall> wut
[2:53:46] <@goose_attack_almanac> FLAVOR BLASTED
[2:53:47] <DracaenaLeaf> ????
[2:53:47] <General_Terro> ??? LUL
[2:53:50] <%Agami23> their mind has been blown
[2:53:50] <%Chichen> flavor to someone who has never tasted flavor
[2:53:51] <%MidnightBurst12> ???
[2:53:51] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt something fare beyond his understanding?
[2:53:51] <+zuzuxiv> ?????? WHAT?
[2:53:52] <%yendoria> Fcuk cool ranch Endwalker fucks tho
[2:53:52] <%SveriSageAdvice> mind has been blown
[2:53:54] <+transporterthesequel> I have beaten Endwalker. That fuckin tracks
[2:53:56] <%watts121> a medieval peasant would spit that shit out
[2:53:58] <haisho> it means Endwalker...is sorcery?
[2:53:58] <@QueequegTheater> It makes sense to me
[2:53:59] <Vermillion129> Uh… how is cool ranch dorito
[2:54:00] <%afronooch> its 100% accurate
[2:54:00] <jorniev> THEY made this place into a paradise so you really felt they didn't deserve all of this shit coming their way
[2:54:00] <luciluxlu0> I get it
[2:54:02] <AllenDeadman> flavorful?
[2:54:06] <$Pompadourius> Zesty doritos are more my thing
[2:54:08] <%shurtal> after eating boiled beef for your entire life, you're given a spicerack and a cook book
[2:54:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> rabbit twink isn't out for ...flesh  yet
[2:54:12] <cimturry> fuck you
[2:54:12] <+JustToWatch> you don't know about the medieval peasant dorito tweet?
[2:54:14] <%snugglepuggs> We don’t deserve such a good an expansion
[2:54:17] <%MidnightBurst12> wait, that makes sense
[2:54:20] <%notsoy> sour cream and onion gang
[2:54:21] <+Shikari21> it means its mind blowing
[2:54:25] <jorniev> I like the cool ranch
[2:54:27] <OmegaWeltall> god i love this sitar playing
[2:54:29] <+embranz> hes saying his eyes have been opened
[2:54:30] <$EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt the joke only works if you like cool ranch
[2:54:33] <$Pompadourius> Cool ranch good. I said it.
[2:54:33] <Daxalog> What came first? Ranch or Cool Ranch?
[2:54:35] <%trancecarlito> official expansion tier list 1.0>Stormblood>ARR>HW>SHB>EW
[2:54:38] <AllenDeadman> I'd like to see him try
[2:54:42] <@goose_attack_almanac> Mans been eating boiled turnips and potatoes for his entire life and was handed a nice montreal bagel with cream cheese
[2:54:42] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt something super flavorful after eating bland stuff their whole life?
[2:54:43] <$EsotericOdyssey> the idea is that cool ranch dorito flavor would kill a medieval peasant from shock
[2:54:43] <jorniev> sour cream and onion tastes so good
[2:54:45] <$Pompadourius> LUL
[2:54:46] <tanarath> It's probably that he had little to no context for how intensely good it was.
[2:54:49] <+unhuggable1> lmao
[2:54:50] <DracaenaLeaf> LUL
[2:54:53] <%Mr_Pylon> That review sounds like it's 2 memes deep and I don't get the first one
[2:54:55] <%JoshManVGH> I saw fucking PLAIN Dorietos on sail the other day! A fucking nightmare bag
[2:54:58] <%cooldude69xx> You're disgusting
[2:54:58] <artoflec> mmm bagels
[2:55:02] <%Kevlar_Caviar> LUL
[2:55:05] <xxshadowxx416> healer really are very salt
[2:55:06] <%Agami23> did you know that the average person these days gets more nacho cheese flavor in one dorito than most peasents saw in their life time?
[2:55:06] <@goose_attack_almanac> o7
[2:55:09] <%legendfather_of_giants> ugh
[2:55:12] <%trancecarlito> It's like if you go to quebec and give them carton milk
[2:55:16] <+zuzuxiv> this music REALLY reminds me of undertale
[2:55:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Maybe it means that its nitche and only for a specific taste?
[2:55:18] <$Pompadourius> IT REALLY DOES
[2:55:18] <%kujofire990> 2442 in queue kill me pls
[2:55:20] <+Shikari21> I HATE IT
[2:55:27] <+Nomenanza> now that you mention it
[2:55:28] <+Shikari21> IT SOUNDS TOO CLOSE FUCKS ME UP
[2:55:28] <+blastazoid00> i thought the same
[2:55:30] <penitentpendant> Yeah, that 'not Undertale' song keeps popping up
[2:55:30] <snowmanse> I thought I was crazy for this. There is even one that sounds like Toriel's house theme
[2:55:33] <Daxalog> The motif is similar
[2:55:34] <+transporterthesequel> Yes
[2:55:35] <dan_g_v> well, we need Determination!
[2:55:38] <citerel> cant believe theres more than one track that sounds like undertale
[2:55:39] <OmegaWeltall> i think Soken got some inspiration from Toby Fox
[2:55:39] <%Chichen> WHERE PAPYRUS THO
[2:55:39] <%Kevlar_Caviar> 👉 LOOK SOMEONE'S COMING
[2:55:41] <+transporterthesequel> Paige cannot handle Endwalker
[2:55:43] <nechronia> Endertale
[2:55:43] <@goose_attack_almanac> would Paige dress like a skeleton
[2:55:43] <+JustToWatch> Inspired by the original tweet "We take it for granted today, but a single Dorito has more extreme nacho flavor than a peasant in the 1400s would get in his whole lifetime."
[2:55:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> Paige would have turned ages ago
[2:55:45] <$EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt this piano song tears my heart out and stomps on it
[2:55:46] <+ALazo> don't worry Pat, she'll never make it this far
[2:55:48] <$EsotericOdyssey> so I can relate
[2:55:48] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[2:55:49] <$OranHexthief> a couple of themes in the expansion give me undertale vibes all with this motif i think
[2:55:50] <penitentpendant> May she enjoy her feels
[2:55:51] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[2:55:52] <+MetroidHunter26> This plays earlier pat so She would be crying the entire time
[2:55:53] <dan_g_v> oh yeah, I'm almost bursting into tears as it is
[2:55:53] <%Gasgrave> They even lied about the theme music and leit motif of this game in the trailers
[2:55:54] <%kujofire990> is just want to play ff14: sceneviewer
[2:55:54] <haisho> I think she'd burst into tears at very many points
[2:55:59] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt She would be doing that for the entire back half of the MSQ anyway
[2:56:00] <jorniev> add skeleton race
[2:56:05] <%RealThiele> oh man paige would die in seto part 2
[2:56:06] <Louie_Salmon> There's a different song that deadass opens with the chord progression of Home, it's wild
[2:56:07] <penitentpendant> @ALazo I mean... Oof. But fair.
[2:56:08] <%Reilata> please don't freak out
[2:56:09] <%Maids4lyfe> cool ranch is good though with choco milk
[2:56:18] <Vermillion129> Has paige been playing ff14 after that first stream?
[2:56:20] <%trancecarlito> SO THE PRESIDENT IS A DRAGON
[2:56:21] <Blu_C> Omnious start.
[2:56:22] <wolverinewaswrong> ??????
[2:56:23] <AllenDeadman> "be not afraid"
[2:56:28] <OmegaWeltall> yea Page would be a blubbering mess playing this
[2:56:28] <+transporterthesequel> What's the money that Paige would survive SHADOWBRINGERS.
[2:56:31] <heartlesshealer> it was elmo
[2:56:32] <+JustToWatch> you know what fair enough
[2:56:33] <OmegaWeltall> Emlo!!!!
[2:56:33] <+polothegreatest> His theme
[2:56:33] <@goose_attack_almanac> I dunno Vtra is pretty snaggletoothed
[2:56:34] <+BIumen> itr could get much worse
[2:56:34] <wolverinewaswrong> yo careful on getting people's mood down
[2:56:35] <+transporterthesequel> Much less Endwalker
[2:56:45] <penitentpendant> @trancecarlito Wait. Which setting are we in again?
[2:56:47] <peachyprimrose> GOOO VRTRA
[2:56:50] <%AHomeschoolDropout> I just want to salute our brave brother and sisters who called out sick for experiencing "Covid-like symptoms" and put themselves into quarantine to play this expansion. o7
[2:56:50] <+CherteuseKapibara> rock the dragon
[2:56:50] <%snugglepuggs> I wish every president was a dragon
[2:56:53] <%Dakuu75> "ISAIDBENOTAFRAID~!"
[2:56:54] <%Reilata> LUL
[2:56:56] <jorniev> IT COULD ALSO BE COOLER
[2:57:01] <+MightyDuckShoes> peach must have felt so cockteased when WoW came out and the undead just had bone hands and elbows
[2:57:01] <@goose_attack_almanac> wait so does Vrtra have one of his eyes in the child?
[2:57:02] <%Mr_Pylon> See kids love dragons!
[2:57:03] <+transporterthesequel> KIDS FUCKIN LOVE DRAGONS
[2:57:06] <+ragermister> KIDS LOVE DRAGONS
[2:57:09] <Louie_Salmon> Wow~!
[2:57:10] <%barrakuta371> The kids love dragons
[2:57:12] <+transporterthesequel> AN IMMUTABLE FACT, ACROSS DIMENSIONS
[2:57:21] <+ThomasOfTroy> Dude, this dragon is HOT
[2:57:21] <%asakura_ayase> I wish my country was ruled by a dragon
[2:57:23] <%MidnightBurst12> DRAGONS ARE FOR THE CHILDREN
[2:57:28] <AllenDeadman> does he always start with that?
[2:57:32] <+MightyDuckShoes> Plague is seething
[2:57:35] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Does Vrtra not know dragonspeak because he's the youngest?
[2:57:35] <%Reilata> I was actually your boss, sick yeah?
[2:57:38] <+transporterthesequel> Fuck I wish we had a dragon for a president
[2:57:39] <Calamity2007> What is the name of this track
[2:57:39] <Vermillion129> Oh yea right these people believe dragon is good for their whole life unlike ishgard
[2:57:44] <+transporterthesequel> Not like, a sentient dragon
[2:57:45] <Vermillion129> This will be ez lmao
[2:57:49] <+transporterthesequel> Just like, a normal dragon.
[2:57:51] <$EsotericOdyssey> @ThomasOfTroy he's also good with children. great stepdad material
[2:57:52] <%snugglepuggs> @transporterthesequel Except in Ishgard during Dragonsong
[2:57:52] <+transporterthesequel> I'
[2:57:57] <+transporterthesequel> I'd take that.
[2:57:57] <%Alazull> So...funny story. I've been secretly ruling you for generations...
[2:57:59] <+Mrbaconator> that dragon has the face of a goblin shark
[2:58:12] <tanarath> I mean, Ishgard sucks, it rejects Dragons.
[2:58:16] <ForlornHunter> @queequegtheater He speaks human because he literally lived around as a shadow ruler his entire life
[2:58:17] <+Havictos> @goose_attack_almanac it's not a real child it's a Au Ra homunculus he used to move around freely
[2:58:26] <@goose_attack_almanac> @Havictos dank
[2:58:32] <jorniev> I wish my president was a dragon... but like this one not like shadow runner
[2:58:35] <%Cozy90> YES CHILD STOP MASTERBATING
[2:58:37] <+transporterthesequel> It's a GREAT detail that he speaks human
[2:58:41] <Louie_Salmon> I kinda can't believe how many slow and emotional moments the game has had time for in the middle of the end of the world
[2:58:49] <%MrP33Ps> @tanarath it rejected* dragons
[2:58:54] <+transporterthesequel> He speaks human because he LIKES HUMANS
[2:58:59] <%strakillias> I love seeing "crowds" in MMOs
[2:59:08] <%MrP33Ps> they're cool with dragons now
[2:59:09] <shadepman> why am i crying
[2:59:12] <%ElkRiverDog> *Looks at the current political climate in my country*  Yeah I'll take a dragon F it

[2:59:27] <Saltmeisterr> :(
[2:59:30] <+ThomasOfTroy> @EsotericOdyssey tfw you will never have a hot dragon husband to help raise your kids and breed more into you NotLikeThis why even live
[2:59:30] <KatabolicRage> he's kindof the most down to earth dragon amongst the first brood really, he just stayed out of shit and lived on his island
[2:59:36] <@QueequegTheater> @MelBrooksKA Just here for now
[2:59:40] <jorniev> yeah .... like the pandemic
[2:59:50] <$EsotericOdyssey> @MelBrooksKA it's on the island right now because of the magic equivalent of a hole in the ozone layer
[2:59:53] <Zombrocom> Yeah vrtra is pretty chill
[2:59:54] <tanarath> Oh, did they finally decide that healing the injured & that helping the poor weren't signs of weakness? @mrp33ps
[2:59:59] <$EsotericOdyssey> @ThomasOfTroy ikr
[3:00:00] <%RocketBarrel> I never expected them to spin Vrtra to be like this. He's such a good boi

[3:00:29] <%MelBrooksKA> @MelBrooksKA Man, magic global warming sucks
[3:00:31] <KnivesEve> Vrtra is the dragonheart
[3:00:39] <%trancecarlito> my favorite son- midgar
[3:00:51] <+transporterthesequel> Must proteec list: Matsya, Nidihana, and Vrtra. If anyone comes near my children I will HARM THEM.
[3:00:57] <AllenDeadman> the youngest of the first brood is so cool
[3:01:04] <%ElkRiverDog> Normally I joke at the lack of people in "crowds" during cutscenes but I'm willing to bet that this is actually that is left
[3:01:06] <Vermillion129> Stupid global warming destroying our magical ozone layer
[3:01:06] <%ramielthe5th> fus ro dah!

[3:02:29] <$EsotericOdyssey> @Blu_C the forum doesn't yet
[3:02:31] <AllenDeadman> nice, I thought they'd just... save themselves
[3:02:34] <Zombrocom> Uh. The satrap is right there.
[3:02:35] <penitentpendant> I mean. You need genetic diversity for long term plans.
[3:02:35] <%JoshManVGH> How surprisingly alright of The Forum
[3:02:40] <%Dakuu75> OH, ok... they are sharing.
[3:02:44] <%VioletHeart> Yeah Sharlayan seems to have chilled out a bit since revealing their plan.
[3:02:47] <AllenDeadman> oop
[3:02:49] <Sol_Install> oh shit endwalker
[3:02:50] <Calamity2007> They aren't forcing people thankfully, just giving them the option
[3:02:51] <Daxalog> Imagine if they showed up here just to say "your not coming". Then they left.
[3:02:52] <%barrakuta371> LUL his face
[3:02:54] <%snugglepuggs> Awkward
[3:02:56] <stevenellis386> "da fuck"

[3:03:06] <%cooldude69xx> @Daxalog Power move
[3:03:09] <@QueequegTheater> APOLOGIZED TO HIM BEFORE APOLOGIZING TO HIS OWN CHILDREN
[3:03:10] <%solracc25> so who wants to go to the moon
[3:03:10] <haisho> "oh fuck it's the dragon"
[3:03:12] <tanarath> Welp. Ishgard being dicks wont have any negative consequences.
[3:03:16] <OmegaWeltall> yea the Sharlayans came across as assholes but they mean well
[3:03:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> but he can't be blamed for ignorance
[3:03:17] <peachyprimrose> Roll up like "look at all these losers that are gonna die. lol. lmao"
[3:03:18] <+JSebz> they're not unreasonable tbh
[3:03:21] <Louie_Salmon> I would have thought, with all this time to prepare, they would have set up some way to tell everyone at once "Hey we have an ark, first come first serve"
[3:03:25] <Calamity2007> Elf dad is surprisingly open minded now.
[3:03:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> Stagnance yeup these are nega sin eaters
[3:03:30] <@goose_attack_almanac> oh no, facts and knowledge here to give people fear

[3:03:48] <karl_rex> I hope these Forum fuckers had to deal with aether sickness to get there
[3:03:49] <+chimaera24> Maybe don't lead with "We knew this was gonna happen years ago"
[3:03:51] <%RocketBarrel> Sounds kinda mad...

[3:04:26] <+CherteuseKapibara> ZEIG ZEON

[3:04:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> MOON IS ANTI HAUNTED
[3:04:38] <Calamity2007> moon rabbits
[3:04:41] <HeroToxiko> raw raw ight the apocalypse?
[3:04:43] <$Pompadourius> I like how he's not just pure evil, he's got his own morals about this.
[3:04:45] <+transporterthesequel> Moon's Magic
[3:04:46] <+Havictos> fuck aßhole you don't get to act like a hero
[3:04:48] <%snugglepuggs> So this planet doesn’t have a REAL moon?
[3:04:51] <%Deft_Thought> Final Boss: Neil Armstrong
[3:04:52] <%Mr_Pylon> wait is this turning into SHADOW RAIDERS?!?!
[3:04:54] <stevenellis386> like some sort of deathstar replica?
[3:04:56] <@QueequegTheater> @snugglepuggs nope
[3:04:56] <+transporterthesequel> Prepares broom, "Moon's Magic."
[3:05:01] <VioletRosefall> wouldn't they still become monsters on the Moon?
[3:05:03] <+Havictos> @snugglepuggs no
[3:05:03] <%trancecarlito> "SOMEONE had to go and kill God" *looks at wol*
[3:05:03] <dan_g_v> who needs real moon
[3:05:07] <%watts121> I mean we been to the moon and there were slendermen there....FFXIV's moon is definitely haunted.
[3:05:12] <Zombrocom> I mean, might as well shelter on the moon for the time being right?
[3:05:17] <%GallowsDrop> we went to the Moon but we didn't see Golbez Where's Golbez I want Golbez
[3:05:19] <jorniev> SO RAHA LIED IN THE TRAILER TOO
[3:05:20] <+JSebz> yoshi-p: the real Moon is fake too LUL
[3:05:21] <penitentpendant> @snugglepuggs Signs point to no. Tides musta been real weird.
[3:05:21] <Bigbossman91> @Pompadourius he was never evil, an asshole yes but not evil
[3:05:22] <karl_rex> Not as big assholes as they could be
[3:05:22] <Blu_C> I foresee no potential problems with this plan to cut and run like the biggest of cowards.
[3:05:24] <Ahack13> @snugglepuggs It was a real moon. It was turned into the ark
[3:05:28] <@QueequegTheater> @VioletRosefall Unless they find a stable planet
[3:05:29] <%Kevlar_Caviar> how the fuck is vrtra gonna fit?
[3:05:29] <%solracc25> Who wants to board the moon-ship
[3:05:29] <+zuzuxiv> midgardsormr
[3:05:32] <%MelBrooksKA> "I'm going to the one place that hasn't been corrupted by dis pear... the moon"
[3:05:35] <+transporterthesequel> Last stream Pat realized The First has NO MOON.
[3:05:38] <jorniev> THERE'S NO MORE SECRETS ON THIS START
[3:05:41] <$Pompadourius> @Bigbossman91 true, I guess that's more what I mean, yeah
[3:05:46] <Calamity2007> I mean that is for some to decide on their own
[3:05:48] <+zuzuxiv> @PatStaresAt no
[3:05:50] <+Akizea> :)
[3:05:51] <%watts121> hmm, one wonders
[3:05:53] <+mortalitas87> thought he was running from omega
[3:05:53] <%MrP33Ps> good question
[3:05:53] <%JohnAtDawn> :)
[3:05:55] <Darkrenai> MegaDooter
[3:05:55] <%yendoria> Omega chased him away
[3:05:56] <%valriot> he was running from Omega
[3:05:56] <+BIumen> hmmm
[3:05:57] <Warbot40> I think it was something else
[3:05:57] <heartlesshealer> :)
[3:05:58] <%GallowsDrop> Who knows?
[3:05:58] <%solracc25> @kevlar_caviar the moonship was made for giant people
[3:05:58] <+BennyBiscuits13> No, still sleeping after Omega
[3:05:58] <%snugglepuggs> So that Endwalker logo is just the moon/pizza ship going to another planet, NOT the moon?
[3:06:00] <+Havictos> @queequegtheater we still don't know how long it would take
[3:06:01] <@QueequegTheater> :)
[3:06:02] <Psyramics> no
[3:06:02] <VioletRosefall> no he was running from Omega and the nation that created it
[3:06:03] <%watts121> darn don't just say no out of hand
[3:06:04] <%Eaglestrike117> Nah he ran from omega, remember? I think thats what came up in that raid
[3:06:05] <schiester420> :)
[3:06:06] <KnivesEve> i thought he was running due to endless war
[3:06:07] <+Havictos> we don't know that
[3:06:08] <penitentpendant> Midgarsomr was running from an ancient civilization with magitech. This doesn't match that MO.
[3:06:08] <+FinetiSonata> did you do the omega story?
[3:06:09] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt didnt he say he was running from wars?
[3:06:11] <%VioletHeart> He was running from Omega.
[3:06:13] <+JSebz> midgarsormr was running from Omega
[3:06:13] <%snugglepuggs> no he was running from Omega
[3:06:15] <$EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt he was running from the war with Omega on his homeworld or something to that effect
[3:06:17] <karl_rex> He ran from Omega
[3:06:19] <$EsotericOdyssey> Omega chased him here
[3:06:25] <%JoshManVGH> Jesus I really need to do the Omega content...
[3:06:28] <Calamity2007> I think Midgardsomer's world was ended by something else
[3:06:30] <Vermillion129> He ran from omega. It’s the storyvof omega raid
[3:06:40] <%Deft_Thought> Drink deep on COPIUM so that we may persist
[3:06:44] <%watts121> there is no need to PANIC
[3:06:44] <%ElkRiverDog> We never learned what prompted Omega's creators to attack Middy's home........
[3:06:51] <@goose_attack_almanac> Mario party is banned for your good
[3:06:53] <+Akizea> :)

[3:07:31] <penitentpendant> This is one of those apocalypses where handing out weed would legitimately fight the problem.

[3:09:25] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt So much for my prediction lel
[3:09:26] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatchTheSquid the opposite, they become 100% emotion
[3:09:28] <HeroToxiko> Mankind Blamed The Beasts
[3:09:30] <%Dakuu75> ppl with depression... YOU'RE DESTROYING THE PLANET~!
[3:09:35] <Vermillion129> Bring out the flower “That’s alot of despair bro”

[3:09:41] <wolverinewaswrong> @PatchTheSquid Heartless time baby
[3:09:44] <%Maids4lyfe> wow
[3:09:48] <Thenuclearwalrus> Just dont be sad 4Head
[3:09:49] <jubejube56> So is there literal depression in the air?
[3:09:54] <@TheYellowcouch> Don't doomscroll. you'll destroy the world
[3:09:54] <%watts121> So Mists of Pandaria had a similar concept...but it was lame.
[3:09:56] <$realm_forge> Spirit bomb the sad away
[3:09:59] <%snugglepuggs> Theme of game: sad bad
[3:09:59] <BreakfastSampler> @Dakuu75 sorry NotLikeThis
[3:09:59] <%Divryne> Lol stop being depressed easy.
[3:10:01] <%watts121> While this is terrifying
[3:10:02] <+Shikari21> @jubejube56 yep
[3:10:03] <OmegaWeltall> @OmegaWeltall pffft you tellin me
[3:10:04] <%OneGorillionDollars> "Don't be alarmed but the air may be LITERALLY poisoned with sadness"
[3:10:07] <heartlesshealer> so all the war is killing the planet
[3:10:07] <nochejunior> WutFace this game is so scary now
[3:10:11] <%Solareon_> god imagine Twitter during the final days
[3:10:15] <+transporterthesequel> @jubejube56 Nah, it's if you catch depression you're fucked
[3:10:16] <$EsotericOdyssey> @jubejube56 yep, there's concentrated Grade X Bad Vibes
[3:10:17] <$realm_forge> So are therapists like ultra powerful mages?
[3:10:17] <%solracc25> Where is Sora? We need the light from Kingdom Hearts right now.
[3:10:21] <+transporterthesequel> DOn't catch depression.
[3:10:23] <+Akizea> wait a fuckin minute..... ARE they technically heartless? fuck man
[3:10:39] <+Ryaotz> I wonder if some of this was influenced by the pandemic
[3:10:40] <%RealThiele> its all kingdom hearts
[3:10:41] <Thenuclearwalrus> Also if you get sad and turn into those monsters, your soul is GONE, no afterlife in a world where an afterlife exists
[3:10:41] <+transporterthesequel> Just don't do it. Get vaccinated against depression.
[3:10:51] <+JSebz> it's soon
[3:10:53] <fran031> You're almost there
[3:10:53] <%UvBenServed> SOON
[3:10:55] <gespenst25> It's in a bit I bet
[3:10:55] <%chiluzza> You passed the stopping point

[3:11:00] <GandhiTheTerrible> it's soon
[3:11:00] <%Metii_Morst> you're like 1 quest away
[3:11:01] <%shootbang_exe> there is a natural stopping point coming up
[3:11:03] <%yendoria> Big soon
[3:11:04] <+transporterthesequel> If you're vaccinated from depression you'll never be sad again.
[3:11:04] <VioletRosefall> think its right after this quest
[3:11:05] <Thenuclearwalrus> You'll know
[3:11:05] <%watts121> yeah it's soon cuz if you don't stop you won't stop
[3:11:05] <%JoshManVGH> Coming up on a good one shortly
[3:11:05] <nechronia> I the game makes it VERY clear when to stop
[3:11:05] <%shootbang_exe> it'll be super obvious
[3:11:05] <xxshadowxx416> @solracc25  disney have him
[3:11:06] <dan_g_v> wasn't the tea the part?
[3:11:07] <ForlornHunter> Oh it’s soon

[3:11:19] <%legendfather_of_giants> very soon
[3:11:21] <%GallowsDrop> it wasn't the chai tea
[3:11:22] <%Alazull> Yes
[3:11:23] <OmegaWeltall> that sitar Kreygasm
[3:11:24] <jorniev> SOMETHING ABOUT A DRINK

[3:11:33] <%snugglepuggs> Maybe
[3:11:36] <%solracc25> @xxshadowxx416 He's busy in the smash dimension
[3:11:38] <%watts121> Zepla didn't stop and her stream ran over like another hour.
[3:11:38] <+JSebz> you'll know lol
[3:11:42] <%Deft_Thought> I could go for a BURGER
[3:11:45] <%CalderGaming> can his excellency the satrap offer you an egg in these trying times
[3:11:47] <%Metii_Morst> you will absolutely know the stopping point when it happens
[3:11:54] <+Nomenanza> there is so much focus on food in this expansion
[3:12:07] <%watts121> Her chat told her to keep going, the fucks.
[3:12:09] <%Monkeyweed21> EAT A GOOD MEAL OR YOUR SOUL EXPLODES
[3:12:10] <dan_g_v> that sounds like it's going to be a lot of story
[3:12:12] <%CalderGaming> @Nomenanza simple pleasures
[3:12:26] <+transporterthesequel> This is 100% a stopping point.
[3:12:35] <+transporterthesequel> If you don't stop, prepare to go for 3 more hours
[3:12:35] <BreakfastSampler> @Nomenanza make sure to sleep too
[3:12:43] <+transporterthesequel> I'm not kidding, you don't have a choice.
[3:12:48] <%snugglepuggs> When  did Pat change his last name?
[3:13:04] <+BIumen> ??
[3:13:04] <fran031> No, you can have the feast first
[3:13:06] <%shootbang_exe> eh, he could conceivably stop after the quest that follows this one
[3:13:06] <%GallowsDrop> No????
[3:13:09] <%trancecarlito> you would pull an all nighter
[3:13:10] <%UvBenServed> You'll know when
[3:13:11] <%shootbang_exe> it'd just be a big cliffhanger
[3:13:11] <GandhiTheTerrible> ???
[3:13:11] <%Kevlar_Caviar> YEAH 3 MORE HOURS
[3:13:12] <@TheYellowcouch> It's not like that
[3:13:12] <%watts121> No if you don't stop the cutscenes will just keep going
[3:13:14] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt you won't WANT to stop for 3 hours if you go too far
[3:13:14] <%UvBenServed> It's fine
[3:13:14] <+Edrem> no
[3:13:15] <%GallowsDrop> idk what they're talking about
[3:13:16] <dan_g_v> wait what?
[3:13:17] <BreakfastSampler> I mean you could stop whenever
[3:13:17] <%watts121> after the feast
[3:13:19] <Thenuclearwalrus> ??? NO LUL
[3:13:19] <KnivesEve> eat first then you can stop
[3:13:19] <+transporterthesequel> I mean emotionally, not physically. Have feast
[3:13:21] <gespenst25> What happens after the feast is compelling
[3:13:21] <BreakfastSampler> but Shit Is About To Go Down
[3:13:25] <@TheYellowcouch> Have the dinner then stop
[3:13:25] <@goose_attack_almanac> Muted is the favourite lie
[3:13:28] <%ShawnTK_> It's fine to keep going
[3:13:29] <AllenDeadman> one guy?
[3:13:31] <+extantCadence> Pat you could just jump down from that walkway
[3:13:36] <+JustToWatch> it is fun to lie to you
[3:13:51] <%solracc25> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[3:13:53] <%GallowsDrop> like, you'll prolly wanna keep going out of intrigue but the game gives you a break
[3:13:58] <%snugglepuggs> It’s not a lie it’s just there is gonna be a plot element that will hook u in
[3:14:03] <%watts121> hell I physically couldn't stop after that point. The story just goes into overdrive.
[3:14:09] <%legendfather_of_giants> after the feast is the correct place to stop, or else you won't want to for a LONG while @PatStaresAt
[3:14:09] <%snugglepuggs> For hours
[3:14:12] <@TheYellowcouch> The game won't force you to do anything
[3:14:14] <$EsotericOdyssey> @PatStaresAt if you get to the next zone you will not want to stop until you are finished with the WHOLE zone, stopping before then is advisable unless you wanna go until like 2 or 3 in the morning
[3:14:17] <%Kevlar_Caviar> oh so you CAN stop but do you want to tho
[3:14:33] <+Akizea> @EsotericOdyssey this is the one right here
[3:14:42] <%RealThiele> yea i guess it depends on how tired pat is
[3:14:43] <penitentpendant> Stopping immediately before or after the feast should be fine. The post feast cutscenes builds some hype.
[3:14:47] <%snugglepuggs> @theyellowcouch Then why does it constantly point a gun at me while playing
[3:14:54] <@TheYellowcouch> Cool lighning knows what's up
[3:14:58] <+Jakeofalco> wow just finished off here aswel
[3:15:00] <@Velyndra> @PatStaresAt check dm

[3:15:17] <%Kevlar_Caviar> well at least pat's starting really early tomorrow so we won't have to wait too long for the pog moments
[3:15:19] <+transporterthesequel> @snugglepuggs That's because you installed the GUN plug in.
[3:15:23] <%GallowsDrop> that man has a gun Pat
[3:15:28] <+extantCadence> I happened to stop last night after the feast and I'm really glad I didn't push it further cause I would have been tormented at work today
[3:15:39] <%watts121> yep I can't wait to see Pat react, hell most peole
[3:15:46] <penitentpendant> @snugglepuggs Are you playing MCH, perhaps?

[3:18:46] <%RocketBarrel> Worst salue
[3:18:47] <haisho> that's a nice coat
[3:19:02] <%GallowsDrop> look at all these JUST stand out enough dudes to not fall into the background
[3:19:26] <%AHomeschoolDropout> You REALLY want to do the Ala Mhigo one
[3:19:26] <Vermillion129> Wao that elf looks like 14 years old with a man body
[3:19:52] <%trancecarlito> i was mad which one i had to do as tank
[3:20:06] <%trancecarlito> havent done it yet but its like this is the one i wanted the least
[3:20:15] <%GallowsDrop> I just realized I'm at level 88 and haven't touched the Role Quests yet I should probably do them tomorrow
[3:20:29] <+lightobliven> lightobliven subscribed with Prime. 
[3:20:36] <%watts121> Casters/Healers god the lions share for the Role Quests.
[3:20:41] <%watts121> got*
[3:20:42] <$EsotericOdyssey> @trancecarlito same
[3:20:43] <%legendfather_of_giants> @GallowsDrop I don't think they're required for MSQ, just to die the job gear
[3:20:48] <tanithmagnus> Of Course it burns over Corvos
[3:20:55] <jorniev> what quest is this?
[3:20:56] <+owo_uwu_owo_my_dude> does the endwalker fight Michael Jackson the Moonwalker in this one?
[3:20:59] <%Archmortal> @GallowsDrop lol I decided to farm the level 85 dungeon for a whole set and ended up at 88 as I was unlocking them
[3:21:07] <$scallycap> wtf is with this music?
[3:21:29] <%trancecarlito> look at how productive this meeting is
[3:21:30] <+DontMindMee> hyped discussions
[3:21:31] <%watts121> it's from ARR, it's like their "military action" music for Grand Companies
[3:21:33] <$Pompadourius> It's the SHB "battle plans are happening" music
[3:21:41] <Vermillion129> @watts121 time to play SMN to get both role quest Kappa
[3:21:47] <$Pompadourius> Or at least, I remember it most fondly from SHB lol
[3:21:53] <+transporterthesequel> I know right?
[3:21:59] <%watts121> @Vermillion129 that's what I did lol
[3:22:07] <AllenDeadman> I mean yeah
[3:22:09] <%CalderGaming> so many NPCs are as smart as you'd hope they'd be in this expansion, it's great
[3:22:10] <karl_rex> Just empty the coffers and give to everyone
[3:22:10] <Darkrenai> Come deal with our problems please, thanks
[3:22:11] <+Akizea> im doing the melee dps role quest rn and its really good. i like it WAY better than the SHB role quest
[3:22:18] <%Reilata> Nice that not just the player can figure out what is wrong.
[3:22:22] <%trancecarlito> *wol breathes in* goddamnit
[3:22:23] <jubejube56> What if we just had a group of clandestine hunters that went around killing all those that turn into beasts
[3:22:26] <+Havictos> Elmo!
[3:22:32] <AlexDaGr8> the most important thing about the apocalypse: the PR battle!
[3:22:33] <jubejube56> and then they like....drank blood or something
[3:22:33] <dan_g_v> Emlo
[3:22:35] <Calamity2007> It is after the tower stuff but this is still cool
[3:22:35] <AllenDeadman> amlo
[3:22:45] <%OneGorillionDollars> can I just say that the fact that we call these monsters "Blasphemies" IS SUPER COOL
[3:22:52] <%watts121> tanks get robbed by having to deal with the most boring city/leader
[3:22:55] <%Kevlar_Caviar> A HOONTER MUST HOONT
[3:22:57] <penitentpendant> Did somebody say... ROLE QUESTS!?
[3:22:58] <%Archmortal> do they even leave blood to drink the way they kinda just dissolve into black smoke?
[3:23:06] <Saltmeisterr> wait enemies have weapon resistences?
[3:23:14] <haisho> physical got split between melee and ranged too
[3:23:15] <Saltmeisterr> oh

[3:23:37] <BreakfastSampler> accept Halone tiddy
[3:23:37] <+Kalentan> yes
[3:23:37] <$MinoMiushi> Gridania rekt

[3:23:40] <%ElkRiverDog> Pat, I don't know why but that whispered voice you just used freaked out my cat LUL
[3:23:41] <%JokerNewby> yee, it's a chain
[3:23:41] <%ShawnTK_> yea
[3:23:42] <GandhiTheTerrible> yes
[3:23:43] <Major_Lee_> THE BEST CITY
[3:23:45] <+Nomenanza> Was so disappointed I had to go to limsa as melee dps and not to my bois at uldah
[3:23:45] <Vermillion129> LUL get fucked
[3:23:46] <%Metii_Morst> at least it's not the ala mhigo on
[3:23:47] <@CreepyPorpoise> ha ha sucker
[3:23:47] <karl_rex> Yeyeyeye help the forest racists
[3:23:48] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt yeah I'm on the 90 quests and havent done them
[3:23:49] <+Havictos> Gridania is probably the worst area in terms of of plot development
[3:23:50] <+DontMindMee> Tanks stuck with Gridania. Unfortunate
[3:23:50] <%GallowsDrop> Tanks get Gridania even though there's only one tank that gets unlocked in Gridania
[3:23:50] <%watts121> I would probably just get them all done at once at 90
[3:23:54] <%CalderGaming> are these required for MSQ this time
[3:23:56] <%kujofire990> its what we tanks get for ez queue
[3:23:56] <IveGotALaserFace> Yes
[3:23:58] <%Agami23> gridania doesent even have any tanks. its funny that they go there
[3:23:58] <$Pompadourius> As a melee DPS I got sent off to Limsa but I was like "NOOO I WANTED TO HANG OUT WITH THE DOMA PEOPLE" lol
[3:23:58] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU HAVE TO SAVE THE TREE RACISTS
[3:24:00] <%Archmortal> I absolutely love which role they gave to Limsa
[3:24:01] <Calamity2007> TOO BAD TANKS GO TO GRIDANIA
[3:24:02] <$MinoMiushi> It's only needed to dye artifact gear anyways
[3:24:02] <Ids560> but pat they only have floor tanks there, they need the help
[3:24:02] <Chaos_Aether> Not mandatory to complete for the end
[3:24:02] <+JSebz> healer chads get uldalamhigo
[3:24:05] <Vermillion129> Yes you can save it for later
[3:24:13] <%ShawnTK_> @CalderGaming No, but there is something else they are required for
[3:24:19] <%watts121> @CalderGaming nope, it unlocks dyable Artifact armor
[3:24:22] <%Ynkubus_> You need to complete one of these to progress later
[3:24:24] <Onamar> pretty much
[3:24:25] <%watts121> kinda yea
[3:24:25] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> yes
[3:24:27] <%Archmortal> @Pompadourius this must be why they give us Sadu so much in Garlemald
[3:24:27] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt not mandatory this time, just to dye job gear
[3:24:27] <+transporterthesequel> YUUUUPPPPPPP
[3:24:27] <%Ebonyglow> yep
[3:24:28] <%JoshManVGH> Seems like!
[3:24:28] <+DontMindMee> That WOULD make sense
[3:24:30] <heartlesshealer> ye
[3:24:31] <KnivesEve> never thought of that
[3:24:32] <+Nomenanza> interesting reason
[3:24:32] <haisho> YEP
[3:24:33] <PainterOfMiniatures> Yep
[3:24:34] <penitentpendant> To a degree
[3:24:35] <%Nekros4442> yeah you generally go where you're needed
[3:24:36] <%JoshManVGH> Mage was Ishguard so makes sense
[3:24:37] <%CalderGaming> @ShawnTK_ thx
[3:24:40] <Vermillion129> Yes
[3:24:42] <+ThreeStrikes_> @Ynkubus_ No you don't.
[3:24:43] <dan_g_v> huh, nice
[3:24:52] <+embranz> They kinda pair you with an NPC that’s a complimentary to your role
[3:24:59] <%chance_h> Dancers to Ishgard?
[3:25:03] <haisho> Radovan?
[3:25:05] <Calamity2007> Interesting a different take
[3:25:07] <%watts121> He left to stand around and do nothing with his bunwife
[3:25:11] <%GallowsDrop> Radovan
[3:25:11] <+lord_sykos> Radovan
[3:25:19] <%Metii_Morst> fordola lul
[3:25:23] <%watts121> my favorite was the healr
[3:25:28] <Warbot40> clever
[3:25:28] <+Nomenanza> oh they put Fodrola here?!
[3:25:46] <%Monkeyweed21> and Astro is in Ishgard
[3:25:48] <%JoshManVGH> Enpi!
[3:25:50] <%watts121> @Nomenanza yep and it's such a good cap to her arc
[3:25:51] <Srthunda> as a healer, why do I have to deal with Fordola
[3:25:54] <+Havictos> Sam has one ranged attack
[3:25:58] <FlamingLambChops> Forgetting FILTHY RATS?
[3:25:59] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Ninja
[3:26:00] <+zuzuxiv> limsa has rogue
[3:26:01] <%kujofire990> monk
[3:26:01] <+BIumen> rogue kinda?
[3:26:02] <%CalderGaming> rogue....
[3:26:03] <%UvBenServed> Just rogue
[3:26:05] <KnivesEve> ninja
[3:26:06] <penitentpendant> They have NIN
[3:26:06] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Rogues, that's it
[3:26:08] <%ShawnTK_> Ishgard has Rogue
[3:26:08] <%yendoria> rogue?
[3:26:09] <Warbot40> rogue
[3:26:11] <Calamity2007> Interesting approach
[3:26:12] <%ShawnTK_> Limsa*
[3:26:12] <$Pompadourius> Limsa has Rogue and thats about it
[3:26:12] <wolverinewaswrong> Rogues
[3:26:13] <haisho> Pirates with muskets!
[3:26:15] <%trancecarlito> drk
[3:26:16] <%Archmortal> Limsa has a shit ton of guns and cannons is I think what they were going for
[3:26:17] <Vakojin> Gotta find something for each
[3:26:17] <heartlesshealer> Limsa
[3:26:18] <%Agami23> rogue barely counts
[3:26:19] <AlexDaGr8> they had to give limsa something
[3:26:20] <%BlueLunecy> It's still mostly guns there
[3:26:22] <+Akizea> rogues are more for subterfuge
[3:26:26] <Warbot40> close enough
[3:26:33] <%yendoria> God I NEED that radiant host armor
[3:26:36] <+ThreeStrikes_> rogue is a support class, don't @ me
[3:26:38] <gespenst25> ishgard is drk and much and AST?
[3:26:40] <%JoshManVGH> Do they have a melee class outside of theives?
[3:26:42] <+lord_sykos> Limsa has it all, clearly it's the best
[3:26:56] <citerel> nin may be more doman
[3:27:00] <%Monkeyweed21> wtf will the final role quest be then?
[3:27:00] <%watts121> It's cuz Merlwyb just wants a twinky bunny boi dps
[3:27:02] <haisho> Limsa has it all, much to its detriment
[3:27:03] <Darkrenai> oh
[3:27:07] <Vermillion129> @threestrikes_ trick attack bot reporting fir duty sir
