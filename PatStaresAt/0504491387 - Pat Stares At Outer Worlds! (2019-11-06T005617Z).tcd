[0:14:16] <dekkitout> @ape_hawk Indeed
[0:14:16] <MasterDecoder> What's a throw?
[0:14:18] <osiris1260> You missed out on some gold stream clips by not going to Cascadia (Monarch) as soon as you got a quest to go there

[0:14:28] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> @UberKingKai is that a Boomer that moves fast?
[0:14:32] <1matheuw> touching your cats belly after they show it ot you is the equivalent of someone showing you some prized possession they have, because they trust you, and you trying to steal it immediately afterwards

[0:15:56] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> It's just glue, pat, geeze
[0:15:56] <Mr_Strut> What grouting? It's not shower tiles.
[0:15:56] <devanmuse> but you're good with gouting
[0:15:58] <$boxboten> but how will you ever know the joy of slamming down that cpu hinge
[0:16:00] <%TaifuDragon> the fans come with that already attached
[0:16:01] <StromkoPenguin> How has the age range for 'boomer' suddenly expanded like four decades? It's weird.
[0:16:02] <%TaifuDragon> you just stick it on
[0:16:02] <%UberKingKai> That’s fair
[0:16:03] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> grouting is boomer for thermal paste

[0:16:20] <%honeyman18> CUNO spooked yah?
[0:16:20] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat What are your PC specs anyway?
[0:16:23] <shurtal> I like how everyone has a way to apply thermal paste, and every way that isn't "THEIR" way is wrong, but NO ONE CAN AGREE so you just panic and hope
[0:16:28] <%UberKingKai> Moon gang 🌚🌚
[0:16:36] <%Admiral_PopnFresh> Is this Grout fiasco worthy of a 1 ?
[0:16:36] <%Razputin217> GOON MANG
[0:16:41] <Mr_Strut> What the shit is grouting?
[0:16:50] <$fabulousgaybear> hey maybe wools could help? @angriestpat
[0:16:51] <%simulationbard> Just remember to smother everything in thermal paste Kappa
[0:16:55] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Nearly everyone agrees that a simple dab is enough for paste

[0:25:16] <%bettysharkface> Sharks are so smooth.
[0:25:17] <%GarbageNirvana> That's all there is to get
[0:25:24] <Fien111> The secret trick of Pat stream is that if your donation makes pat stroke out you get a full refund. Not subs, though
[0:25:30] <+griffball13> SO FANCY
[0:25:31] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Is it good?
[0:25:31] <dekkitout> Sharks smell fine- everyone's just mean PunOko
[0:25:35] <%depressed_skeleton> Fancy fancy

[0:25:42] <%umbypokochan> ass paddles
[0:25:45] <%honeyman18> Eww
[0:25:45] <Nina96> what are those for?
[0:25:46] <Cobaltor_252> now Pat can be extra SWEATY
[0:25:46] <%SvenHolgersson> thats fucking stupid
[0:25:47] <%AncelDeLambert> an OBSCENELY ovepriced controller, some might say
[0:25:48] <%GarbageNirvana> yaaay jackass paddles
[0:25:48] <%ghostofreznov> I swear if you drop it
[0:25:50] <%bettysharkface> Do not like this shark racism
[0:25:51] <%BenWuArt> BenWuArt subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:25:54] <%depressed_skeleton> Ass paddles!
[0:25:55] <Jontman42> The price tag makes it fancy
[0:25:55] <1matheuw> wow that controler is pretty fancy AND overpriced
[0:25:59] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> PAT
[0:26:00] <+griffball13> controller whale
[0:26:01] <oktavia_von> but why
[0:26:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> jackass paddles are pointless
[0:26:03] <Monkeyweed21> what are those even for?
[0:26:05] <+2DSuperiority> I can't not think of the Crowbcat video with all the controller defects
[0:26:11] <dekkitout> That thing almost costs $200. Does it come with a cock warmer?
[0:26:13] <KingGoblodyte> Is that the $180 controller?
[0:26:15] <%UberKingKai> It is your copy of gigantic asses weekly
[0:26:16] <%depressed_skeleton> @AngriestPat Does this mean you're an Elite Pro now?
[0:26:17] <PirateMike_> @AngriestPat Why for the love of god would you play a shooter with a controller
[0:26:20] <peanutandbuttershow> wow
[0:26:20] <Monkeyweed21> exprain
[0:26:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> it's so you can accidentally press buttons
[0:26:21] <%bettysharkface> Oh boy, efficiency
[0:26:22] <%Yukasmarvin> Pat is an asshole confirmed, for like the 100th time xD
[0:26:38] <peanutandbuttershow> I want one
[0:26:44] <osiris1260> Just Crab Claw. It’s clearly superior
[0:26:52] <+NitronStreams> turn those face buttons into ass buttons
[0:26:53] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Is Pat a normal human being?
[0:26:54] <%bettysharkface> It has...a special case
[0:26:54] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Cool, I can relate to that!
[0:26:55] <oktavia_von> tomatoDisgust
[0:26:57] <ミュウレ4242> but does it have a reloadable battery in the shape of a clip?
[0:27:01] <%cvp5127> nerd

[0:27:11] <MasterDecoder> @PirateMike_ Why would you not? For some of us, it's easier/better
[0:27:12] <%MightyMaxT> nliL1 nliL2 nliL3
[0:27:17] <peanutandbuttershow> Bring out the ps4 controller
[0:27:21] <+Ell1ot> so you flex your ass cheeks and you jump and stuff?
[0:27:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat is your front door open?
[0:27:35] <osiris1260> ! CRAB GANG !
[0:27:38] <PirateMike_> @MasterDecoder Because aim is so much more accurate with a mouse
[0:27:39] <dekkitout> Face down/ass up, that's the way we like to do some grinding off screen
[0:27:43] <%derap41> that's bullshit those rechargable ones burn out way to fast
[0:27:46] <%depressed_skeleton> Who's Talking?!
[0:27:46] <Fien111> Wire the controller into your nervous system, chummer!
[0:27:48] <+Ell1ot> hi Paige!
[0:27:48] <%linSP> hes talking about his penis zipper
[0:27:48] <%SvenHolgersson> DONT ANSWER
[0:27:50] <+griffball13> thats not a yes
[0:27:50] <%Typhaeon> Should be like the Cerberus +1, just whack it to change battery from red to green
[0:27:52] <benjiFG> but WOULD you

[0:27:57] <MasterDecoder> @PirateMike_ My point still stands
[0:27:59] <SilverFaustX> now he has to look
[0:28:01] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat pat, if you think jackson pollock is bad, look up mark rothko. the dude just painted shitty rectangles
[0:28:02] <%bettysharkface> Nice controller and case Pat, looking forward to seeing you fight that space capitalism

[0:28:08] <Fien111> Don't worry Pat, I closed it behind me

[0:28:12] <wholewheat420> Hello Paige, I hope you're feeling okay!
[0:28:16] <Nina96> but what if though
[0:28:16] <Mr_Strut> At least you remembered to turn the stove off, right?
[0:28:23] <%Big_Dream> Pat smells
[0:28:25] <PirateMike_> huehuehuehue
[0:28:26] <lloyddboy> one collective bitch
[0:28:27] <MasterCosmic> Im sure someone closed it for you.
[0:28:32] <oktavia_von> the controller seems Convoluted,
[0:28:34] <%depressed_skeleton> Dab dab dab
[0:28:36] <$shurtal> cheer500 Had to babysit a lady at work doing long exposure photography. Bascially just stood around for 6 hours with only one bathroom break and no lunch. Happy B-day Elmo.
[0:29:01] <Ion_Laser> Diablo 4 will probably have The Microtransactions dumped in later
[0:29:03] <%depressed_skeleton> I'd laugh if Fuggins just came in and was like "Hey guys"
[0:29:07] <%SvenHolgersson> so its a WIN/WIN
[0:29:24] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I like how Diablo 4 is what we wanted visually a decade ago.
[0:29:26] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 I'm becoming increasingly worried about my BUS/PHL class, business ethics, as my professor has forgone a class of what constitutes ethical behaviour, or multiple points of view, in favor of "Unethical because unhappy! Meditate and think happy thought to make your thoughts come true! THIS IS A UNIVERSAL LAW!" discount "The Secret"

[0:30:23] <%simulationbard> Pat can't shove the drug in his mouth fast enough
[0:30:25] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat why don't you store your unique weapons so they don't clutter up your inventory and weigh you down
[0:30:30] <%Kirby_Sauce> in space, no-one can hear your BGM

[0:31:33] <Monkeyweed21> are you?
[0:31:36] <PirateMike_> People prefer to play these sorta games then watch

[0:31:38] <deviljhojho_> lik me smile
[0:31:39] <Dementedpenguin> I usually do it because I don't want to be spoiled on the game.
[0:31:39] <%bettysharkface> I have a big concern about the poopy cows
[0:31:42] <1matheuw> was that french?
[0:31:43] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I'll always be here... always
[0:31:43] <%PROUD2beGINGER> They're probably playing it themselves
[0:31:43] <Badgerconda_> That's so weird. These are my favorite playthroughs.
[0:31:45] <jinshiroi> I'm only not watching cuz I'm still playing the game
[0:31:46] <dekkitout> Buckle in for DS

[0:31:52] <%GarbageNirvana> Selling garbage becomes a big part of these sorts of games
[0:31:53] <%bread_assassin> Or scrap it for parts.
[0:31:53] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat it could also be because they want to play it themselves
[0:31:57] <%depressed_skeleton> @AngriestPat True fans / Friends watch every single Episode.

[0:32:03] <$Echlir> I think paying the rent is more important than knowing the true fans
[0:32:04] <%pectusumbra> not for nothing most of it is just you go too late. On that note, good night!

[0:32:44] <Fien111> I guess that's the danger of streaming? "Oh shit, this looks great! Better stop watching so I don't ruin the play experience. Thanks pat!"

[0:33:22] <Fien111> I imagine the keyboard has a button
[0:33:24] <%derap41> omg they dropped the sort on the controller XD
[0:33:26] <1matheuw> pristine shotgun
[0:33:34] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat You should buy in bulk garbage bargain bin games and have a stream called "Dumpster diving" with just trash cheap games
[0:33:38] <+Darren716> Yeah dont use a controller, you lose a ton of function
[0:33:45] <%Ner234> Space Crime. Reminds me of that Astronaut lady who was the first person to commit a crime while in space. That was weirdly funny
[0:33:50] <PirateMike_> @derap41 lolololol
[0:33:55] <flyingavocad0s> How far is he?
[0:33:57] <%derap41> btw pat stat wise the mk II are the same as they're just higher level
[0:34:08] <+Finch_9001> Go to YOUR inventory, sort, then go back to companion’s screen.
[0:34:10] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> But you might need it.
[0:34:18] <%SvenHolgersson> Shoot it our the airlock
[0:34:19] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!

[0:34:45] <%derap41> They're just higher level
[0:34:54] <+Darren716> Well theyre the last weapons youll get in the game
[0:34:55] <cham52> Did I walk into Inventory problems? Are the gobbos making a mess again?
[0:34:56] <%depressed_skeleton> mk2 better than mk1
[0:34:58] <+spiceyweasle> I have watched a few people play outer worlds and every time they are messing with their inventory. is this game mostly based off of min maxing your gear?
[0:34:59] <+Darren716> Nothing new from here
[0:35:03] <Djinnazz> kiss?
[0:35:03] <%derap41> if you tinker a normal one to the same level they're exactly the same
[0:35:03] <%Lizard0TM> @angriestpat the pause button sorts

[0:35:53] <Cybersoul666> @angriestpat Mk2. , Ultra , etc. are overall upgrades. and keep in mind. tinkering cost more the more you do it. so if there's a weapon you like there may be just an overall better version to have.
[0:35:54] <This_is_Marco> put everything into 2-handed Kappa

[0:44:12] <leinadtonu> so, who brushed pat so much?
[0:44:16] <Ion_Laser> OH SIHT
[0:44:24] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat What if MODOK is the main villain in the Squeenix Avengers game?
[0:44:25] <PirateMike_> Babushka Pat
[0:44:27] <%Razputin217> DO A FLIP
[0:44:30] <%torontototoro> the lines for no-damage combat are a nice touch
[0:44:30] <%TenderBabyBacon> Elmo must be Clean
[0:44:34] <benjiFG> i looked back for a second and because pat was crouching it looked like ellie was huge
[0:44:36] <cham52> How is pat killing things with 1 sneak shot? Did he go full on long weapons?
[0:44:36] <Zebroneath> Good thing mantisaurs are super weak to corrosion
[0:44:50] <flyingavocad0s> Should have played on hard
[0:44:53] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Does this game have sweet ass sniper rifles? I like sweet ass sniper rifles.
[0:44:58] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Moon gang
[0:44:59] <ScreamLord> Looks like a bit of Bethesda rubbed off on Obsidian after all LUL
[0:45:02] <+zed11111111> haven't heard many good things about this game. is it gud?
[0:45:06] <%Stevennapalm> ew
[0:45:07] <PirateMike_> Kappa
[0:45:08] <%derap41> btw you're not getting any bonus damage with acid against rapto's
[0:45:10] <KaiserMario> GROSS
[0:45:11] <%SvenHolgersson> We tried that Pat died like 4 times in a row
[0:45:12] <Ion_Laser> ???
[0:45:13] <+griffball13> he stared on hard, died 5 times in a row and switched it to normal
[0:45:13] <cham52> Oh this is normal, that answers my question i guess
[0:45:14] <%torontototoro> pat is objectively not hard. he's short, soft, and squishy
[0:45:17] <Seraphile> Hard on controller is ugh
[0:45:17] <KaiserMario> ! REPORT !
[0:45:17] <Mr_Strut> You're about as hard as a jelly roll
[0:45:29] <%barkon345> barkon345 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 3 month streak! 
[0:45:30] <islancerdead> What is he doing now, exactly?
[0:45:30] <osiris1260> Raise difficulty
[0:45:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> you look pretty soft Pat.
[0:45:32] <%Stevennapalm> elmo very yell
[0:45:32] <PirateMike_> Get paige to help with the... "swelling"
[0:45:35] <%Tredecian> @zed11111111 yea its pretty good
[0:45:38] <%MightyMaxT> I keep laughing at the sudden moon faces, they're great
[0:45:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> HE SCREM
[0:45:41] <%grifgrifter> apatPorgmo
[0:45:42] <This_is_Marco> enemy weakness LUL I just used Vermin the entire run
[0:45:42] <Seraphile> theres a 90 picklock door
[0:45:43] <%honeyman18> Wonder Why
[0:45:48] <%UberKingKai> He’s angy
[0:45:50] <mark_collins45> Elmo likes it harder!
[0:45:50] <%derap41> Japanese soda bottles !
[0:45:51] <Seraphile> it has something good
[0:45:52] <leinadtonu> Pat's hard on the inside. like in his arteries.
[0:45:54] <%realm_forge> Pat is stale candied ginger hard
[0:46:01] <%derap41> its non unique and crap
[0:46:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> RATSLAYETR
[0:46:03] <%AncelDeLambert> it's a generic gun
[0:46:03] <This_is_Marco> its trash
[0:46:05] <%Stevennapalm> Ratslayer when tho
[0:46:05] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> It has KO effect
[0:46:09] <%ape_hawk> the vermin is common
[0:46:09] <%honeyman18> Marty Robbins
[0:46:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> just a normal gun
[0:46:11] <+zed11111111> @tredecian only pretty good?
[0:46:12] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat don't sell this one like you sold the Ratslayer
[0:46:14] <%torontototoro> Vermin is a decent magnum. Not unique.
[0:46:15] <%derap41> it sucks because it looks cool
[0:46:18] <osiris1260> It’s a type of gun
[0:46:18] <%juxtest> Elmo will take the hair by force if he has to
[0:46:19] <%DSD24> Rah Rah Rah
[0:46:19] <dekkitout> Pat, you sold the- ah forget it...
[0:46:20] <flyingavocad0s> @seraphile I didn’t have problems. Can’t turn off aim assist tho
[0:46:21] <%SvenHolgersson> Rizzo the Rat
[0:46:25] <moistborne> the vermin is one of the best pistols tho
[0:46:27] <%lionmanguy> !uptime
[0:46:27] <%DSD24> Rizzo's is the worst
[0:46:27] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 46m 29s.
[0:46:28] <%realm_forge> Elmo likes it rough
[0:46:32] <cham52> YOU SOLD RATSLAYER??
[0:46:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> you can buy it from all the vending machines
[0:46:34] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> RIP Ratslayer
[0:46:36] <hntronium> rip ratslayer the sold
[0:46:36] <%lionmanguy> OOOOH RIGHT
[0:46:38] <jellssssss20> We knew you kept your controller on your crotch for a reason, Mr. “I’m always hard”
[0:46:39] <SaltyDavid> I'm playing on hard and once I got a Dead Eye rifle everything dies easy and my long guns skill is in the single digits
[0:46:39] <%lionmanguy> Daylight savings
[0:46:39] <%AncelDeLambert> EVERYONE BETRAY ME I FED UP WITH ZIS WORYLD
[0:46:40] <%derap41> he sold Ratslayer wtf
[0:46:41] <Mr_Strut> Did you think we'd let you forget?
[0:46:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat sold ratslayer
[0:46:44] <%Ner234> Time is convoluted
[0:46:45] <%lionmanguy> Which we don't do down here. That's the delay
[0:46:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> EDE HAS RATSLAYER YOU FUCKS
[0:46:50] <%Big_Dream> Sold rat slayer
[0:46:52] <TurbulencE413> @AngriestPat I would seel ratslayer
[0:46:52] <%torontototoro> too bad scaling your weapons up is so bad if you don't have high engineering
[0:46:55] <dekkitout> The flow of time is convoluted in chat
[0:46:55] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Very Fallout
[0:46:56] <1matheuw> rip ratslayer gone but not forgotten
[0:46:56] <cham52> I can't believe Pat ruined the whole LP by selling Ratslayer what a madman
[0:47:01] <mankeyfigh> @angriestpat Are you actually having fun with this difficulty? It seems too easy
[0:47:05] <Seraphile> @AngriestPat you missed the 90 lockpick door
[0:47:06] <$WackyXmand> We on Monarch?
[0:47:13] <%derap41> @torontototoro you mean science?
[0:47:14] <%AncelDeLambert> @mankeyfigh it's DEFINITELY too easy
[0:47:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pats missing so many useless items muh gawd
[0:47:18] <osiris1260> This seems way too easy
[0:47:18] <Monkeyweed21> this IS edgewater after what you did
[0:47:20] <hntronium> he cowarded out on first stream he can't brave up now
[0:47:21] <%MightyMaxT> Funny enough, Pavarti says that when she's in the party
[0:47:25] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat that is why he likes paige so much Kappa
[0:47:26] <Djinnazz> oh hey Paige
[0:47:29] <dekkitout> "IF Edgewater got fucked?"
[0:47:29] <%foreverN2dust> Like what if edgewater lost power Kappa
[0:47:31] <Seraphile> parvati+felix can boost you
[0:47:32] <%SvenHolgersson> @AngriestPat Is that why you love Paige so much?
[0:47:37] <Seraphile> to 90 lockpick
[0:47:38] <%torontototoro> @derap41 yeah, that one. I played a low INT build. Tinkering was prohibitively expensive
[0:47:38] <%StaceMcGate> I wanted to try the higher difficulty but the idea of having to go and sleep every hour sold me off
[0:47:39] <%linSP> dont make fun of paige pat
[0:48:00] <cham52> "What's that noise?" Asks Pat, with a face full of alien bees.
[0:48:01] <%Agami23> oh lord, its the pat stares at community!
[0:48:02] <%AncelDeLambert> I haven't checked the game to see how often it wants you to sleep, so I can't say
[0:48:05] <PirateMike_> @foreverN2dust watchu mean
[0:48:05] <%UberKingKai> If you kill people and chose the dumb options parvati will stay with you because it would be irresponsible to leave you alone
[0:48:07] <jellssssss20> Why would you have to sleep every hour?
[0:48:08] <allanmiri> Turns out this game does have a few bugs
[0:48:09] <+Neale2theMusic> Be me and made my character addicted to drugs and nicotine, have to inahle drugs every 2 minutes
[0:48:11] <%derap41> @torontototoro yeah and its bugged if you start tinkering before 100 you don't get the bonuses once you get to 100
[0:48:19] <%logoth_> The bachroom
[0:48:27] <hntronium> because there was a demon in it taking a shit
[0:48:29] <Mr_Strut> It's a bathroom. You're supposed to lock it.
[0:48:29] <This_is_Marco> @Neale2theMusic thats the true hardmode
[0:48:30] <%honeyman18> Pat got his Lotion
[0:48:36] <%derap41> Just don't tinker unique weapons before you get 100 science
[0:48:39] <Djinnazz> @Neale2theMusic Speedrun starts
[0:48:40] <%StaceMcGate> @jellssssss20 The highest difficulty requires the character to sleep, like Fallout 4 Survival mode
[0:48:47] <%torontototoro> @AngriestPat tinkering is bad and expensive if you're a dumbass low int build :(
[0:48:52] <osiris1260> Your going to get invincible real fast, I’d advise you raise the difficulty
[0:48:53] <%grifgrifter> why have large animals overran this town?
[0:48:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> I found a bathroom in this game where there was a guard pooping
[0:48:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 100 science
[0:48:59] <Monkeyweed21> you already have 100 science
[0:49:10] <%AncelDeLambert> I read it as constiple, so it's okay, Pat
[0:49:10] <PirateMike_> Kim Possible?
[0:49:10] <dekkitout> You too eh
[0:49:12] <%SilvaChariot0133> Sarcasm Detected
[0:49:14] <%honeyman18> FurFest?
[0:49:14] <+Neale2theMusic> @This_is_Marco thats when you learn where every vending machine to cop smokes every second your alive
[0:49:21] <%SvenHolgersson> Con Stoppable and Pro Possible
[0:49:21] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[0:49:23] <%StaceMcGate> It's cheaper to just respec into engineering/science each time you wish to tinker @AngriestPat
[0:49:26] <Seraphile> its worth putting felix and parvati in your party, take drugs to boost yourself to 90 lockpick, the unique item behind that door is worth it
[0:49:28] <%marvel877> Con Stoppable? Don't remember that Kim Possible character...
[0:49:31] <%depressed_skeleton> Pet the doggo\
[0:49:31] <MasterDecoder> You sure that's a dog Pat?
[0:49:35] <%linSP> go to saw con pat
[0:49:36] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat you can't get in yet Pat
[0:49:47] <cham52> Use your moon jumps to boost yourself up pat
[0:49:49] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> you wish
[0:49:51] <Seraphile> you have to make an entire loop around the map
[0:50:02] <%Piemen99> It's their kid @marvel877
[0:50:07] <%honeyman18> Yay
[0:50:08] <%Undenizen> no way across the bridge :< gotta go around the loooooong way
[0:50:14] <%grifgrifter> or not
[0:50:14] <This_is_Marco> @Neale2theMusic when I saw that condition I noped on it, but I like to imagine how it would go LUL
[0:50:18] <%StaceMcGate> I think you get into the constable via Rizzos ircc
[0:50:19] <SaltyDavid> The Constoppable can only be entered through a bunch of bullshit
[0:50:19] <cham52> How did Pat even get to Cascadia without finding anything else on the map?
[0:50:22] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Can only be opened from the otherside
[0:50:22] <%SilvaChariot0133> Classy AF
[0:50:24] <%DSD24> Yeah you gotta go the long way around
[0:50:25] <%depressed_skeleton> Sealed to keep the flavour good
[0:50:25] <%hazzy_o7> The other side is too easy, it has roads.
[0:50:28] <dekkitout> Nice
[0:50:28] <ミュウレ4242> follow me. set me free. trust me and we can escape from the city.
[0:50:33] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat trust us, man, use the "proper" landing site first
[0:50:38] <Monkeyweed21> this is what you get for going to the shitty landing pad
[0:50:41] <%bread_assassin> @cham52 He landed there.
[0:50:43] <+BrotherOrin> I just jumped in, is Pat playing as Pops from Regular Show?
[0:50:46] <%StaceMcGate> @cham52 you can fly straight to cascadia but the game recommends you do as the enemies are 10 levels higher than what you would be
[0:50:47] <%Razputin217> Gotta go through the quarry
[0:50:50] <osiris1260> Cascadia is the first port you unlock on Monarch, it’s where most people go first
[0:51:00] <%honeyman18> It's a long walk man, and that's not till thursday
[0:51:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> buffering...
[0:51:01] <%derap41> This part really feel like they tried to recreate the cazadors valley and Deathclaw sanctuary
[0:51:01] <%hazzy_o7> It's super easy to just sprint to stellar bay though
[0:51:01] <%grifgrifter> wild blue yonder ahoy
[0:51:04] <%AncelDeLambert> it's the same map, so whatever
[0:51:04] <%Undenizen> hey pat, do you like RUNNING YOUR ASS OFF?
[0:51:07] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Mantiqueen Gang
[0:51:08] <%starotter70> What up?
[0:51:12] <%AncelDeLambert> BIG deathclaws
[0:51:12] <%Razputin217> Who's ready for DEATHCLAWS?!
[0:51:12] <cham52> I must've completely forgotten about that, thanks.
[0:51:13] <Seraphile> yep
[0:51:17] <Fujiwara_92> nah, I waited and when to stellar bay
[0:51:20] <Seraphile> mechanically they are death claws
[0:51:21] <%SilvaChariot0133> Jobberclaws
[0:51:23] <%derap41> Like using strong enemies to stop the player but balance is fucked
[0:51:25] <PirateMike_> POINTS
[0:51:25] <Fujiwara_92> *went
[0:51:27] <+Neale2theMusic> these mfers are awful on hard
[0:51:28] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, I waited for the proper one, too
[0:51:29] <%derap41> so it doesn't
[0:51:30] <Djinnazz> LVL UP!
[0:51:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> fucking Manticores
[0:51:32] <%CrabSlacks> deathclaws that barf fire I guess
[0:51:32] <%StaceMcGate> Mantiqueens come nowhere as close as deathclaws, they still just jobbers
[0:51:32] <%grifgrifter> yay
[0:51:32] <Kinteka> They're not really deathclaws at all since they die super fast
[0:51:36] <%bread_assassin> @AngriestPat If you were just going to take the long way anyways, why'd you pay 10k for the Nav key?
[0:51:39] <dekkitout> Virgin Mantisaur, Chad Deathclaw
[0:51:39] <jellssssss20> Never fast travel ever again, gotta prepare for Death Stranding!
[0:51:41] <Seraphile> in hard its actuallly really hard to get thru their meatwall
[0:51:41] <%Kiiper> Oh man they are so weak on normal
[0:51:42] <+Neale2theMusic> I was the same level going in, wait for a queen gl
[0:51:43] <osiris1260> WOOOOOOOW. Is he playing on easy?
[0:51:44] <%TheStarvingGood> too easy not deathclaws
[0:51:44] <cham52> Keep going straight north for BIG BOYS
[0:51:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> gun
[0:51:53] <1matheuw> go for GUN
[0:51:54] <%unclekulikov> sneaky moon boy
[0:51:57] <Seraphile> hard difficulty i just snuck/ran past them
[0:52:02] <%derap41> Shit you got 100 science tinker all you want
[0:52:08] <%hazzy_o7> I just sprinted and healed on hard lol
[0:52:09] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> 2 clips to takedown 4 Mantiqueens... Hard
[0:52:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> sweden
[0:52:18] <SaltyDavid> Don't put any more points in combat skills the game is already too easy
[0:52:19] <%Undenizen> lockpicking and persuation is OP.
[0:52:27] <Fujiwara_92> they shoot plasma
[0:52:28] <jellssssss20> Lockpick, lockpick!
[0:52:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> mantisaurs barf plasma at you
[0:52:35] <osiris1260> Those are supposed to be tough, your difficulty is WAY too low
[0:52:41] <%UberKingKai> It’s because elmos b-day is lit
[0:52:54] <%grifgrifter> apatHat
[0:52:54] <%StaceMcGate> Is this easy or normal?
[0:53:02] <%derap41> Those trees are pretty
[0:53:04] <%AncelDeLambert> oddly enough, Pat has the counter element equiped currently
[0:53:05] <%SilvaChariot0133> Cease and continue Ceasing
[0:53:06] <This_is_Marco> these guys were easy on hard you all just suck
[0:53:10] <%AncelDeLambert> LITERALLY the quarry
[0:53:10] <%Jrocy247> @AngriestPat These are some weak ass Deathclaws
[0:53:14] <+Neale2theMusic> Hahaha I wish I ran into them like this, and yea its straight up the quarry
[0:53:14] <+Darren716> It really isnt though
[0:53:14] <%Stevennapalm> I don't like those cutaways for companions
[0:53:20] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I'm playing on hard and those mantiqueens go down in two hits from my science hammer
[0:53:20] <dekkitout> Good ol Quarry Junction...
[0:53:20] <jellssssss20> Those are *so* mass effect
[0:53:27] <cham52> They weren't hard but the acid stuff was annoying
[0:53:29] <%bread_assassin> Well, normal IS easy. Hard mode feels like normal.
[0:53:36] <%MightyMaxT> It's Normal, iirc. That acid machine gun tears through everything
[0:53:36] <%happyface699> Hey boys. Happy burpday to the elmo.
[0:53:41] <%grifgrifter> apatBig moon jumps
[0:53:42] <%StaceMcGate> No enemy in this game is particular hard, you can run away easy peasy and they won't chase far
[0:53:43] <ItIsSky> now where are the cazadors?
[0:53:48] <cureneckbeard> it seems easy because pat is very good at video games.
[0:53:50] <trueherobappo> @AngriestPat Might this perhaps be Monarch?
[0:53:50] <%SirFancySwank> Hop for Speed Strats
[0:53:51] <%foreverN2dust> Raptidon meat is 1lb each, shit weighs you down quick.
[0:53:51] <%AncelDeLambert> They're in the walls, it's a bughunt, man!
[0:53:53] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm playing on Supernova right now and the hardest thing about the game are the shitty autosaves
[0:54:02] <%Jrocy247> So I like how Monarch is literally just your Fallout setting world. Down to the t
[0:54:07] <Djinnazz> Stop exsisting
[0:54:25] <osiris1260> Science hammer does like 8k damage per swing, so that means he’s apparently doing around 6k do’s with his party or something unless he’s playing on easy
[0:54:27] <Djinnazz> oh shit
[0:54:28] <Seraphile> grounded, sweet
[0:54:28] <1matheuw> wow
[0:54:30] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, this game has a difficulty problem. It's too easy in general and the weapon power curve is borked
[0:54:31] <%grifgrifter> WHOA
[0:54:32] <1matheuw> what a big number
[0:54:34] <+MoonObscure> holyshit
[0:54:35] <%SirFancySwank> ultra medicore
[0:54:35] <%happyface699> You guys like my new peach qoute I put on twitter?
[0:54:37] <%derap41> Best assult rifle you're gonna find
[0:54:37] <%CrabSlacks> Tinker that shit
[0:54:41] <%honeyman18> ARU for short
[0:54:41] <jellssssss20> Have other planets/places felt like other games as much as this feels like fallout?
[0:54:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> pretty sure this is mostly just a "gear is bigger than the area" issue. but even at harder difficulties, the right weapon elements make things go down fast.
[0:54:47] <%derap41> or is it
[0:54:48] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> higher level though
[0:54:51] <%Jrocy247> Also, Hope you have been using all your bits for upgrading your early weapons
[0:54:52] <SaltyDavid> Just tinker it a bit
[0:54:56] <%derap41> check the levels
[0:54:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> PLUS ULTRA
[0:54:56] <Fujiwara_92> it's not upgraded pat
[0:54:59] <cham52> That's what happens when you TINKER
[0:55:01] <Seraphile> this game is gonna be great with mods
[0:55:02] <%grifgrifter> apatBig ULTRA apatCaw
[0:55:04] <%hazzy_o7> it has no mods
[0:55:04] <%derap41> shit you're right
[0:55:07] <%CrabSlacks> You tinkered that gun
[0:55:08] <1matheuw> you also leveled and tinkered it
[0:55:10] <sirrice77> yes but the tinker will be cheaper
[0:55:11] <%honeyman18> meh
[0:55:18] <allanmiri> Did you tinker that gun?
[0:55:19] <SaltyDavid> It also has no mods on it
[0:55:19] <42nfl19> @angriestpat will you finish all the side quests before the main quest? just the companion quests? or wing it?
[0:55:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> no mods
[0:55:21] <%CrabSlacks> it's level 26
[0:55:28] <%derap41> what's the mods?
[0:55:29] <%linSP> go number go
[0:55:31] <Fujiwara_92> it will be cheaper to tinker pat
[0:55:33] <osiris1260> It’s a lower level and doesn’t have mods equipped
[0:55:33] <%CrabSlacks> TINKER
[0:55:33] <%fallen92x> did your gun have mods?
[0:55:34] <sirrice77> just tinker it and slap some mods
[0:55:34] <PrinceSpacezero> 21 doodKen doodFive
[0:55:34] <Seraphile> NUMBERS
[0:55:37] <%Piemen99> That's a destiny gun for sure
[0:55:38] <dekkitout> Yep- that is a gun
[0:55:38] <flyingavocad0s> It has higher damage
[0:55:40] <%linkster291> You also haven't modded teh gun yet.
[0:55:41] <%StaceMcGate> New gun will be cheaper to tinker
[0:55:43] <Seraphile> un modded
[0:55:44] <+Nanocomputer> The cost to upgrade will be lower
[0:55:46] <%happyface699> @angriestpat Pat should Paige eat the baby?
[0:55:46] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> the gun that is level 20 appeared to be 26 on stream
[0:55:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> tinker, get mod, biiiiig numbers
[0:55:52] <SaltyDavid> Pat you don't know how to make NUMBERS BIGGER
[0:55:55] <%linkster291> That Number will also jump up because it's DPS.
[0:55:56] <%CrabSlacks> TINKER YOU FUCK +% LEVELS
[0:55:58] <$fabulousgaybear> not upgraded though
[0:56:00] <%honeyman18> Science helps but not that much, always use elements
[0:56:03] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Hios science is 100 everything is cheap
[0:56:07] <%UberKingKai> They are big
[0:56:08] <moistborne> damage per bullet is higher
[0:56:08] <osiris1260> Pat, you don’t know how mods work
[0:56:10] <sirrice77> @AngriestPat Tinker cost is not based on level, its based on how much you have already tinkered the gun
[0:56:12] <This_is_Marco> tinker cost is something. stuff gets expensive
[0:56:14] <moistborne> just has less bullets
[0:56:18] <1matheuw> it aint modedd either
[0:56:28] <%happyface699> Tinker tink
[0:56:30] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat do armor/weapon mods incite the mind goblins?
[0:56:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> start high lvl = go big number
[0:57:00] <%CrabSlacks> He has 100 science so tinkering is dirt cheap
[0:57:12] <%fallen92x> yeah if you nput the mag num mod on the gun it's dps goes up so it would be better
[0:57:27] <+Darren716> Trust me you wont for long
[0:57:28] <%happyface699> Haven’t watched any of this game and first thoughts is it’s literally fallout but better
[0:57:29] <Djinnazz> @AngriestPat is a melee build viable in this game?
[0:57:31] <This_is_Marco> time to hoard
[0:57:31] <VERDAXY> missed a BODY
[0:57:34] <%StaceMcGate> stupid rapidon meat is heavy and fills you limit so fast
[0:57:40] <+Darren716> You'll hover around 2k of each
[0:57:41] <%UberKingKai> Wow apatLiz
[0:57:43] <%derap41> 100 science means he should tinker uniques to get broken strong weapons
[0:57:48] <Seraphile> its not cold its SULFUR IN THE AIR
[0:57:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> @djinnazz yes.
[0:57:51] <%honeyman18> Stinky Planet
[0:57:54] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> It might be chilly in the mornings, like with a cool breeze.
[0:58:00] <Seraphile> FEEL THE BURN IN YOUR LUNGS
[0:58:00] <%foreverN2dust> nope, just acidic and stinky
[0:58:02] <1matheuw> i mean its full of insects so it couldnt be cold
[0:58:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeah
[0:58:04] <%happyface699> @seraphile LIKE BREATHING IN SULFUR
[0:58:08] <jellssssss20> Chat:It’s too easy! Pat:I’m actually using up ammo, nice!
[0:58:08] <trueherobappo> I'm assuming you just got here.. @AngriestPat
[0:58:09] <SaltyDavid> It's a planet full of farts Pat. Farts aren't cold
[0:58:13] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Raptidon meat is heavy, watchout for your capcity
[0:58:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> monarch is a weeping sore of a planet
[0:58:17] <PirateMike_> Take a sulfur bath it's relaxing
[0:58:19] <%StaceMcGate> this is indeed the fart gas planet
[0:58:23] <Monkeyweed21> missed another body
[0:58:28] <$rekinom> Those moon helmets haunt my dreams
[0:58:40] <tinypouf> moon husband
[0:58:42] <osiris1260> He should use the science hammer if he wants REAL BIG NUMBERS. He has the build for it, he just needs 40 in two-handed to one-shot every enemy in the game
[0:58:42] <+fugatlas> I still don't actually understand what tinker does
[0:58:50] <Monkeyweed21> youve barely USED uniques @AngriestPat
[0:58:54] <SaltyDavid> Tinker just makes the number bigger
[0:58:55] <%UberKingKai> I unironically want one of those moon helmets
[0:58:58] <This_is_Marco> @fugatlas just upgrades damage
[0:58:58] <%hazzy_o7> Do uniques actually do more? Can't a lot of them not be modded?
[0:58:59] <sirrice77> @fugatlas just boost the damage by raising the item level
[0:59:00] <%StaceMcGate> Tinker increases gear or weapons level, making the number go up
[0:59:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> there's one on this planet that's awesome.
[0:59:03] <Seraphile> theres a unique on this planet which is a glob gun
[0:59:05] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> the corrision gun you gave Ellie is a fantastic unique to tinker
[0:59:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> it's a top hat.
[0:59:08] <%happyface699> Pat you should tinker yourself and ascend past existing
[0:59:08] <Seraphile> its the only one i liked
[0:59:11] <%derap41> @fugatlas just increases the level so pretty much only increases damage
[0:59:20] <jellssssss20> Will there ever be another hat Pat will ever wear?
[0:59:22] <%honeyman18> Heavy Machine Gun Gang for me
[0:59:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> BRRRAAAAAP
[0:59:30] <%derap41> its only level 10 image if its 20
[0:59:35] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> level 10 at that damage
[0:59:36] <1matheuw> ellie is imune to sulfur
[0:59:37] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat the science weapon on this planet is busted, it's a mortar
[0:59:38] <SaltyDavid> Ellie lol
[0:59:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> also there's a shotgun that's sweet.
[0:59:48] <osiris1260> ITS LEVEL 10
[0:59:48] <%penguinsarefly> Ellie just burning her legs off in that acid
[0:59:54] <%happyface699> WAIT THeRe IS A ELLIE IN THID
[0:59:57] <%MightyMaxT> I ran with a Shotgun, Magnum and a Scythe
[1:00:01] <Seraphile> @StaceMcGate that gun was the only unique i liked
[1:00:22] <%happyface699> GARBAGE RETURN
[1:00:24] <%StaceMcGate> @Seraphile Mind control gun is a good CC too, I made mantiqueens kill all their babies
[1:00:32] <%LodiFrostbeard> !uptime
[1:00:32] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 34s.
[1:00:34] <%TubeMan642> They Science weapon on this planet is an anti-gravity grenade launcher
[1:00:37] <%derap41> He was a prison guard right?
[1:00:37] <Animal_Farm4> Learned it in prison from the moon gang
[1:00:50] <+Creggamonsta> is anyone else playing on normal difficult and just shredding enemies?
[1:00:53] <%happyface699> Those faces freak me out
[1:00:57] <This_is_Marco> @StaceMcGate tha- thats so mean FeelsBadMan
[1:00:57] <%derap41> That on a heavy machine gun is so good
[1:00:58] <SaltyDavid> @derap41 No he was a prisoner
[1:01:02] <osiris1260> If you have 100 science and 40 Two-handed, you can two-shot almost every boss in the game
[1:01:03] <1matheuw> is that a gun with 1k dmg?
[1:01:04] <jellssssss20> I’ve heard ridiculous things about a science hammer, and I hope it’s just a small little hammer-n-nails hammer lol
[1:01:07] <flyingavocad0s> @angriestpat raptidon meat will fill up your inventory super fast
[1:01:09] <%StaceMcGate> Did Max ever tell us why he went to prison? I did his companion quest and still have no clue
[1:01:15] <%AncelDeLambert> here
[1:01:18] <%derap41> yeah on monarh
[1:01:20] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat there's no good unique sniper I ever encountered
[1:01:26] <%LodiFrostbeard> @Creggamonsta it's not that hard on hard even, i'd try supernova but i want to use my companions
[1:01:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> there's one at Devils Peak
[1:01:35] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah
[1:01:35] <Seraphile> honestly non unique sniper rifles are good enough
[1:01:36] <Futurecity10> Natural
[1:01:38] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Monarch is a big fucking zone
[1:01:39] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Pat has no pts in melee so f the hammer build
[1:01:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> like ratslayer?
[1:01:46] <jellssssss20> Devils peak?
[1:01:47] <%derap41> its a bit out of the way but people will scream when you get close
[1:01:48] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The goo gun is kind of a grenade launcher
[1:01:51] <%Piemen99> boooo
[1:01:54] <SaltyDavid> PAT THE GAME IS TOO EASY
[1:01:58] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Pat is looking extra bald today.
[1:02:02] <%Piemen99> i expected more
[1:02:03] <Zebroneath> There should be a better hunting rifle somewhere on this planet.
[1:02:06] <%happyface699> This game is very pretty
[1:02:07] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> You got im, Max
[1:02:08] <%StaceMcGate> I found assault rifles better than snipers, Whenever I sniped from a distance enemies would hit their barrier and go back and heal
[1:02:09] <%honeyman18> That was the second strongest enemy in the game byw
[1:02:12] <1matheuw> he just shot a dead body
[1:02:14] <%Dylveryn> I mean he IS playing on normal
[1:02:16] <1matheuw> what a savage
[1:02:20] <thegreenbenis> LAW
[1:02:25] <thegreenbenis> I AM THE LAW
[1:02:26] <+Creggamonsta> I'll try hard and see how it goes
[1:02:26] <osiris1260> @jellssssss20 He already has the hammer, but he doesn’t have 40 two-handed so he can’t use its main ability
[1:02:30] <%happyface699> LAW
[1:02:44] <%derap41> sell don't scrap!!
[1:02:54] <Seraphile> he's junking
[1:02:59] <%derap41> ah
[1:03:00] <%CrabSlacks> do you get persuaion bonus's to sale prices when you sell to a vending machine?
[1:03:09] <Seraphile> no
[1:03:19] <%StaceMcGate> I had like 3000 armor/weapon points by this point, Pat hasn't done much tinkering has he?
[1:03:35] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Whats weird is the best melee build actually only needs 20 melee
[1:03:39] <%Undenizen> fun fact: Pavati's romance was written by an asexual writer.
[1:03:49] <%StaceMcGate> @CrabSlacks Only perks affect vending machines, and you need hacking 40 to sell to them
[1:03:57] <jellssssss20> Imagine Pat just killing the biggest baddest things, and then standing there and throwing a bunch of guns out on to their dead bodies
[1:04:01] <VERDAXY> loot loot steal
[1:04:03] <osiris1260> Broken melee build has 40 in two handed and 100 in science
[1:04:05] <Seraphile> Pavarti's romance was so well done
[1:04:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 100 wew
[1:04:18] <%derap41> shotgun is on a mission sniper is on a roof on monarch
[1:04:21] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat I believe you need to do the sublight quest for an assault rifle
[1:04:25] <+Darren716> Unique rifle is on next planet for now just rock the ultra
[1:04:25] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!

[1:09:20] <osiris1260> God, I’m so upset he has a perfect hammer build yet he’s using a gun
[1:09:26] <%derap41> This is where you get a uniqie shotty
[1:09:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Gas giants are wads of matter too small to actually begin fusion under their own gravitational force
[1:09:33] <%StaceMcGate> Honestly this quest has the most important decision on the planet
[1:09:36] <osiris1260> I still love him tho
[1:10:02] <Saltima> pat are you on hard?
[1:10:03] <%Ner234> G U N
[1:10:04] <ミュウレ4242> fruit_pie_the_magician, could you nuke them to ignite a small sun?
[1:10:05] <%honeyman18> I trust him to ruin this place Too.
[1:10:08] <%SvenHolgersson> Guns are for cowards and cannot be trusted
[1:10:08] <%CrabSlacks> Guns make the bang bang
[1:10:08] <nb45yes> fun for schools
[1:10:09] <Seraphile> G U N
[1:10:09] <%Stevennapalm> guns > melee losers
[1:10:09] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> He has no points in meleee
[1:10:10] <%derap41> Prismatic hammer is so busted its not even fun to use
[1:10:11] <%MightyMaxT> What about a Scythe
[1:10:11] <%SvenHolgersson> UNLIKE YOUR FISTS
[1:10:13] <MasterDecoder> @fruit_pie_the_magician Like I said, they peaked early
[1:10:15] <%Ner234> @Saltima Normal
[1:10:20] <nb45yes> in ur mom
[1:10:21] <+Darren716> Youre way away
[1:10:21] <Monkeyweed21> the wall
[1:10:23] <%ape_hawk> the wall
[1:10:27] <+Darren716> You started on the opposite side of it
[1:10:30] <nb45yes> yep
[1:10:32] <%RupanSen> "the gun is good, the penis is eeevil"
[1:10:33] <%fallen92x> the other end of the map
[1:10:34] <+Darren716> The other space port was the city
[1:10:35] <nb45yes> ur mom
[1:10:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> a scythe is just a knife on a stick
[1:10:43] <@lewdskeletor13> Howdy y’all, what have I missed
[1:10:49] <%derap41> You spent 10 000 to not have to do this
[1:10:49] <%Ner234> It's just acid jeez crybaby
[1:10:53] <%happyface699> The city starts when it’s built on rock and roll
[1:10:55] <MasterDecoder> @lewdskeletor13 Ellie dying but not really
[1:10:55] <%depressed_skeleton> Acid hurts
[1:11:02] <%Piemen99> everything @lewdskeletor13
[1:11:06] <%honeyman18> Max's Balls were melting Pat.
[1:11:09] <dekkitout> Max has a high ph balance, no shit he hates acid LUL
[1:11:13] <%derap41> Yeah but you didn't need to spend the money
[1:11:16] <+brightman42> oh Jesus, did he start at casscadia? the fuck
[1:11:19] <Saltima> I noticed that wen I killed a mega mantiqueen in half a clip that normal wasn't the best challenge.
[1:11:22] <1matheuw> he says it but hes actively tanking the acid shot
[1:11:24] <RamirezGloom> Im here on my Birthday! I get to spend it with Pat! Huzzah!
[1:11:25] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> He missed the gave of the Hero, there are 2 uniques there
[1:11:26] <%UberKingKai> Do it out of spite
[1:11:31] <@lewdskeletor13> Oh my god did he start at Cascadia LUL
[1:11:32] <SaltyDavid> Wait Pat already bought the Nev Key to not do this shit?
[1:11:39] <Monkeyweed21> every second you waste on this crap is another second towards Death Stranding
[1:11:41] <Seraphile> @dekkitout are you implying that Max is ...*basic*
[1:11:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I doubt it, jupiter allegedly has massive unending lightning storms that have some kind of super lightning in them, and that isnt setting anything off
[1:11:44] <%Ner234> @lewdskeletor13 Yup
[1:11:50] <%StaceMcGate> Pat went out of his way to start at the wrong area since the game tells you over and over not to go there first
[1:11:53] <dekkitout> Mostly salty, really
[1:11:56] <%derap41> Man Vicar is a baby when it comes to acid
[1:11:56] <1matheuw> oh no the vicar died
[1:12:05] <%juxtest> Too much acid, not enough Max
[1:12:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> likewise direct strikes by comets and, presumably, actual rocky planet strikes
[1:12:08] <%happyface699> I can’t wait for death stranding holy shit
[1:12:20] <+Darren716> Yeah this is just gonna waste time because there are a ton of quests in the city that send you right back out into the wastes
[1:12:21] <@lewdskeletor13> Now that he’s on Monarch he can do Max’s quest
[1:12:22] <%CrabSlacks> just rub some dirt into those chemical burns
[1:12:29] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Feath Stranding will be interesting
[1:12:31] <RamirezGloom> Norman Reedus and the Funky Fetus!
[1:12:45] <%StaceMcGate> I have no clue how the game will respond with Pat entering through the gates instead of the starport
[1:12:52] <+brightman42> it's like a useless sequence break
[1:12:55] <%happyface699> I hope we see Conan o Brian
[1:12:55] <gekizenbu> Norman Reedus and the death by dehydraton by only chugging Monster Energy
[1:12:55] <%SvenHolgersson> YAY
[1:12:56] <%Ner234> We did it
[1:12:58] <%depressed_skeleton> Especially me?
[1:12:59] <%Piemen99> really?
[1:13:00] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> He made it
[1:13:00] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> DOUBT
[1:13:01] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I did nothing, as per usual
[1:13:02] <%honeyman18> You have a lot of Raptadon Meat Pat.

[1:13:17] <%SvenHolgersson> You streaming Norman Reedus Piss Simulator? @AngriestPat
[1:13:19] <%derap41> This is my favorite town its nice but not too nice
[1:13:21] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Pat, raptadon meat weighs 1 lb each, so you should get rid of it
[1:13:23] <RamirezGloom> If Conan O'Brien isn't DLC I'm gonna loose it.
[1:13:28] <%depressed_skeleton> Man this planet has dirty looking air, it must be made of Stinky Riders!
[1:13:34] <%happyface699> @ramirezgloom I swear man
[1:13:38] <1matheuw> burn it down
[1:13:40] <+Darren716> Aww man i just realized Pat isnt going to get the dialoge with the security gaurd
[1:13:42] <@lewdskeletor13> Stinky Elmo spores in the air
[1:13:44] <Seraphile> monarch is honestly the nicest place
[1:13:50] <%depressed_skeleton> Elmo isn't stinky
[1:13:50] <%SilvaChariot0133> Probably fine
[1:13:52] <Seraphile> in all of halcyon
[1:13:53] <%depressed_skeleton> Only Rider is stinky
[1:13:54] <dekkitout> Hot damn, it does
[1:13:54] <+brightman42> is he still losing money by selling everything to vending machines?
[1:13:55] <ItIsSky> monarch's trying its best
[1:13:56] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Heated arguments on the number of ladders to bring on missions
[1:14:00] <%derap41> This whole game pretty much is Pandora before it was completely fucked

[1:15:06] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @AngriestPat I don't think there's a unique weapon on any rooftops in Stellar Bay. I've been looking around for like 20 minutes and it looks like a big 3.
[1:15:06] <SaltyDavid> What about Piderman
[1:15:07] <%SvenHolgersson> I also want Spiders-Man
[1:15:10] <%StaceMcGate> Now the question is: Did Pat sequence break the game by not entering through the space port?

[1:16:03] <ミュウレ4242> last i heard, marvel maintains that every liscenced spider-man tie-in happened in some comic universe, in case they suddenly want to sell a crossover.

[1:17:20] <TheOneUpWarrior> tossball seems to get more complicated everytime I hear about it. there are backers and tossers hitter and front bench. It seems like a weird mix of like lacrosse and baseball.

[1:33:46] <%derap41> Oh and this city actually produces Saltuna and not Sprattuna
[1:33:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> So this guy actually cares
[1:33:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> Sanjar is a corporate stooge but this planet nails home a point that was kinda missed earlier on.
[1:33:53] <%grifgrifter> outcome hazy please try again
[1:33:56] <Djinnazz> lol
[1:33:56] <%AncelDeLambert> YEP!!!!

[1:43:06] <%StrifeZubia> I worked with Sanjar and still got through Byzantium nooo probs
[1:43:06] <%honeyman18> On BYZANTIUM
[1:43:06] <%grifgrifter> dangerous information apatSmug
[1:43:08] <Djinnazz> @AngriestPat This reminds me of that board group Hermes is in in Futurama.
[1:43:10] <Archmortal> wait TWO factions fuck up Byzantium?
[1:43:13] <%ape_hawk> if you side with the iconos
[1:43:15] <RushUnplugged> not a single quest, a series of bad Board karma
[1:43:25] <%PaladinDupre> I went to Byzantium with 100% negative board
[1:43:25] <Seraphile> many factions fuck up byzantium
[1:43:35] <+FearEngine> The quests for Lilya in groundbreaker hit hard
[1:43:36] <%Tearonex> NYOKA BEST WAIFU
[1:43:46] <VERDAXY> soo bang celia Robbins yay or nay?
[1:43:46] <%honeyman18> NYOKA 4 LIFE
[1:43:47] <%Stevennapalm> the graphics cards?
[1:43:48] <Seraphile> its almost like the boards motivations are opposed to nearly everyone else in the system
[1:43:48] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Ohhhh everyone shut it
[1:43:55] <%AncelDeLambert> fucking Nyoka bug, goddammit
[1:44:00] <+Darren716> I was able to get the compromise on Monarch and Bzantium was fine
[1:44:00] <%derap41> They played it by they book
[1:44:06] <@lewdskeletor13> @angriestpat you don’t have to chose one faction here, there is a peaceful outcome btw
[1:44:09] <%Stevennapalm> @VERDAXY yes, pls
[1:44:35] <Seraphile> the peaceful option is super easy to f*ck up
[1:44:37] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> This guy is talking such sense I am so nervous
[1:44:46] <%derap41> They made fart gas everywhere
[1:44:51] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> alright no one give him advice, I wanna see which outcoe he gets naturally
[1:44:58] <%RiceeFTW> @Seraphile I disagree, but there's a caveat to that peace route
[1:45:00] <42nfl19> So with 6 companions, you could have 30 unique interactions when talking to NPCs.
[1:45:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> They pulled out and made a big mess
[1:45:04] <Seraphile> me two rainmaker
[1:45:05] <%ape_hawk> yes, you can
[1:45:14] <dekkitout> In short "No one wanted the garbage, so we capitalized on it"
[1:45:15] <+griffball13> WHAT A CONCEPT

[1:46:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> this dude stole a planet.

[1:48:18] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> What if indeed
[1:48:19] <%ape_hawk> thing about monarch is that its not a solely sustainable planet thanks to the terraforming fuckery, so they kinda need outside help
[1:48:20] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> BIG MURDER
[1:48:21] <dekkitout> He'd probably b line off the deep end somehow

[1:49:32] <%nekodelic> @rosa_buttsemburg tbf Sanjar sounds more like an union leader forced into a corporate system than bourgeoisie

[2:35:59] <%lotharrio> "Gail's erotic adventure" written by Abigail.
[2:35:59] <StromkoPenguin> It's a really dumb meme and is applied pretty much entirely to people who aren't boomers.
[2:36:01] <doctor_be> Again, boomer is a state of mind
[2:36:02] <dekkitout> As each day passes 'ok boomer' loses meaning
[2:36:03] <%Jrocy247> I'm surprised no one is using it's counter, Ok Zoomer.
[2:36:06] <ALazo> It sounds really silly to me
[2:36:06] <%linSP> if the boomers keep calling themselves boomers and saying ok boomer it wont be fun so please stop
[2:36:06] <+DazedCookies> ok boomer
[2:36:08] <%derap41> Its so perfectly dismissive like "ok grandpa"

[2:36:15] <AbysmalWulf> I like how certain people are trying to make it the new N-word
[2:36:17] <bear_breaker20> "ok boomer" is so zoomer tho

[2:50:31] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> i kinda want to believe... even if it is foolish
[2:50:32] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat I guess Woolie Will Never Figure it Out, huh?
[2:50:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat so are you saying the big number payoff is with Woolie or should I do combo with Octo?
[2:50:46] <Sokumotanaka> I can't believe punch mom is single Kappa
[2:50:46] <$Tarcanist_> woolie will figure it out, pat! don't shoot him down so easily squilCringe

[2:51:03] <+SleazyShell> Oh yeah this quest
[2:51:06] <doctor_be> Lets hope for the most epic crazy talk
[2:51:18] <dekkitout> I now am imagining Woolie like a certain character at the end of a certain movie being told "You can rest now"
[2:51:18] <megaminimechamocha> Hey is this that bad game?
[2:51:21] <%derap41> fucking Outworld looking
[2:51:24] <%Undenizen> it smells of sulphur and fish :3
[2:51:24] <%GarbageNirvana> It's predominantly sulfur
[2:51:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> one thing I dislike is that a lot of the quest names are spoilery.
[2:51:26] <%foreverN2dust> Max is the best
[2:51:29] <Sokumotanaka> Nah but I honestly think woolie knows it's all in good fun
[2:51:33] <@lewdskeletor13> Monarch is a real shithole
[2:51:37] <+DashXero> The Moon Gang has moseyed into town. Gonna shoot everyone they see...
[2:51:39] <doctor_be> Wait... I see your plan @AngriestPat , If he loses you can say you called it, if he wins you can say it was all to activate crazy talk!
[2:51:40] <%derap41> so many morel mushrooms tho
[2:51:43] <superd4v3> @dekkitout But love is just chemicals ok?
[2:51:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> @megaminimechamocha the only thing bad about it is that its an epic exclusive
[2:51:49] <bear_breaker20> nice dogs
[2:51:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> there is a unique hat in the church
[2:51:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> @lewdskeletor13 With the least shitty management
[2:51:54] <Sokumotanaka> So when octopimp as castle super beast guest? @AngriestPat
[2:51:56] <+brightman42> is he avoiding a new companion cause he actually hates purple dreads?
[2:51:57] <+weaster4> From far away, "Vicar Max" looks like "Your Mom"
[2:51:58] <megaminimechamocha> @doc_ock_rokc That IS pretty bad, though
[2:52:17] <@lewdskeletor13> @generalscpatton True, it’s a nice contrast
[2:52:17] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Will he find the hat.....
[2:52:19] <StromkoPenguin> I think you can also get this game on the Microsoft store? So you have a choice of real bad stores.
[2:52:30] <doctor_be> Gamepass is worth it
[2:52:37] <%honeyman18> Pat has a knack for Tiny Hats
[2:52:40] <reiju_22> the xbox beta app is awful
[2:52:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> srsly though. there is fancy skellington in the church
[2:52:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its endlessly ironic that a game with such scathing commentary on capitalism is on the worst platform ever
[2:52:57] <doctor_be> I used steam during its beginning, I can handle horrible betas
[2:52:58] <+brightman42> that is a nice hat
[2:52:59] <megaminimechamocha> I knew Outer Worlds would make liars out of all of you Epic Store boycotters LUL
[2:53:01] <%AncelDeLambert> "A save"
[2:53:03] <doctor_be> In before Ok boomer
[2:53:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> big locky
[2:53:06] <%AncelDeLambert> a SAVE
[2:53:14] <%AncelDeLambert> A saVe?
[2:53:16] <@lewdskeletor13> @doc_ock_rokc Tim Cain even said that it was ironic in an interview LUL
[2:53:17] <dukenux> its ironic that yhe game doesnt force you to rely on stuff SC sells
[2:53:19] <+DashXero> A corpse and its sprat.
[2:53:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> @megaminimechamocha You can get it on gamepass for a dollar
[2:53:20] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> yo that dude is hugging a sprat
[2:53:20] <Seraphile> i got it physical on ps4
[2:53:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I haven't had any problems myself.
[2:53:21] <%derap41> Did Pat ever notice the windows?
[2:53:21] <%MightyMaxT> Spooning his sprat
[2:53:29] <%GeneralSCPatton> @megaminimechamocha I'm still boycotting
[2:53:30] <+griffball13> is that guy sleeping with a sprat @AngriestPat
[2:53:32] <%MelBrooksKA> @megaminimechamocha Not a lair yet, I'm an honest liar
[2:53:33] <+SleazyShell> @angriestpat Just a PSA, Raptidon meat is heavy and it's a consumable so it doesn't show up as junk so it can encumber you quickly
[2:53:34] <+trustycoyote> There is a good side though. At least it's not Google Stadia
[2:53:35] <%lotharrio> Microsoft is forcing all these restart-required updates. It's maddening. The last one took like 6 hours to finish.
[2:53:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Tags: Forced, Ahegao, Heart Pupils
[2:53:41] <%honeyman18> Died snuggling his pet Sprat, cute
[2:53:43] <StromkoPenguin> I'm still holding out on EGS, but mostly because I'm filled with universal apathy.
[2:53:50] <$RubberFistFight> is anybody else getting a bunch of buffering every now and then? Seems independent of quality options, and my internet is otherwise fine.
[2:53:50] <Seraphile> @SleazyShell that happened to me
[2:53:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @megaminimechamocha also I am not buying the game until it finally comes out on a normal platform
[2:54:00] <doctor_be> Its attempts to integrate the x-box app with windows is actually annoying
[2:54:12] <doctor_be> it would probably be more stable if it was its own thing
[2:54:22] <Seraphile> search church thoroughly
[2:54:26] <doctor_be> HAT
[2:54:27] <+ausl0> Top hat time
[2:54:27] <+griffball13> TOP HAT

[2:55:09] <viciousgrim> chat is the n-ray mod better on the LMG mk2 or HMG 2?

[2:55:27] <superd4v3> @AngriestPat Will you be playing Death Stranding when it comes out?
[2:55:31] <%MelBrooksKA> It's not great
[2:55:37] <%lotharrio> @viciousgrim Whichever has higher DPS. N-ray will ignore armor, so high initial damage doesn't matter.

[2:57:18] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat heads up, I'm gonna dm you on twitter when you're done re: a bitrate thing. Nothing to panic about, just a thing that OBS does that's a pain in the ass for high-bitrate streams.
[2:57:23] <TheMorilo> THAT'S STRONG
[2:57:23] <doctor_be> Its an old build in DnD and Shadowrun
[2:57:24] <mankeyfigh> @AngriestPat So, you actually could peacefully resolve that situation with that lady you killed, but that'll be for another playthrough
[2:57:26] <dukenux> Thats a good one
[2:57:27] <%Ner234> That's good
[2:57:28] <Daxalog> Diplomancer sounds like a class in Dredmor
[2:57:29] <+Grayhammatter> do the dip
[2:57:29] <+DashXero> That's a good word.
[2:57:30] <%Lost_Zombie> You're an eyeball wizard?

[2:57:44] <dekkitout> "I cast parlay, bitch"
[2:57:44] <@lewdskeletor13> That’s very strong
[2:57:46] <dukenux> Thats every of my Fallout character's class
[2:57:57] <doctor_be> You would have high enough diplomacy to make anything friendly
[2:57:59] <fruit_pie_the_magician> He practices Diplomancy

[2:58:05] <42nfl19> Diplomancer is a common build in tabletop games like Pathfinder, Shadowrun, and DnD @AngriestPat
[2:58:05] <+Grayhammatter> uh oh
[2:58:06] <doctor_be> this is why you never do rules as written
[2:58:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> Well you are a dip

[3:03:01] <+DashXero> Homegirl is creepy as fuck.

[3:03:16] <+ThunderZebraKing> Hey pat, try to leave B)
[3:03:16] <%Piemen99> Super cannibals
[3:03:17] <+Darren716> Pat try to leave
[3:03:17] <LeauxAyeQueue> BLAT BLAT 😡
[3:03:19] <+brightman42> why are cannibals never subtle?
[3:03:22] <dukenux> theyre so obvious
[3:03:23] <+Darren716> See what happens
[3:03:26] <%JohnAtDawn> This is the third middle age woman we've seen that looks almost the same
[3:03:27] <+SleazyShell> Pat try to go out the front door now
[3:03:27] <DrFacilier> she thinks you're a snack LUL
[3:03:30] <mor3gan> CALLED IT
[3:03:33] <flyingavocad0s> Upstairs
[3:03:33] <$RubberFistFight> @nekodelic cannibalism in itself alone isn't enough to cause prion diseases. Whatever you're consuming has to contain them. Meaning if you eat a healthy person, you'll be fine, but if you eat a person sick with prion disease, you're fucked. Same reason only some cows caused mad cow disease, not all of them.
[3:03:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> Cheer1000 In D&D 3.5, the Diplomacy DC for changing someone's attitude was a static number depending on their current attitude. The target's level is not a factor. And rushing Diplomacy as a full-round action has a large, but manageable, penalty. So a hyper specialized build lets you turn a group of murderous foes of any strength into your best friends in 1 turn, like magic, but with words. *jazz hands* DIPLOMANCY!
[3:03:39] <SpaceGuntank> does everyone here have a unibrow? jesus christ
[3:03:44] <TheApeGatsby> I loved the second episode of the walking dead game!
[3:03:45] <@lewdskeletor13> @brightman42 Because if you’re crazy enough to be a cannibal you’re not gonna be able to hide it very well
[3:03:46] <%SvenHolgersson> Oh they fucking ate his shit hard
[3:03:51] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> KIMMY SCHMIDT

[3:05:45] <+DashXero> Please shoot them all.
[3:06:03] <mankeyfigh> @AngriestPat Honestly these NPC's having the same faces is fucking with me
[3:06:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> why must every frontier have canibals
[3:06:06] <ALazo> It seems really easy to get away with theft
[3:06:08] <%SvenHolgersson> God I wonder how the big dumb run would go
[3:06:13] <ALazo> More than usual
[3:06:19] <%derap41> Nice place to be honest
[3:06:20] <@lewdskeletor13> @svenholgersson It’s very funny
[3:06:21] <mankeyfigh> Also maybe pickpocket?
[3:06:32] <JittersCaffeine> Door's locked

[3:07:00] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Fallout 3!? WutFace
[3:07:04] <ShoggothLord> @doc_ock_rokc Because the Donner Party decided to eat each other rather than take the food the Native Americans left for them. That dumb fuckery alone made it a trope.
[3:07:14] <tinypouf> big cannibal energy
[3:07:15] <+DashXero> Put something sharpened in his throat.
[3:07:16] <WeebFever> Kill him
[3:07:16] <ALazo> I'm still waiting for someone to bring up long pig
[3:07:17] <WeebFever> now

[3:07:36] <mayorrev> ATTACK
[3:07:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ShoggothLord that is extremely innaccurate
[3:07:37] <%SGrim> Big Cannibal Energy
[3:07:39] <abakkus> youre either gonna get poisoned or down some familiar longpig and idk which is worse
[3:07:42] <+AnsonSioux> yep

[3:07:45] <+SleazyShell> YEP
[3:07:49] <%Ner234> Yup
[3:07:51] <%Daniel_Is_I> Why is it ALWAYS cannibals?
[3:07:52] <%darcfowler1995> man I must be really smart because I got this as soon as I went through the door and did something very drastic very quickly
[3:07:53] <%Parapattern> Yep that's about the size of it
[3:07:54] <mayorrev> yep
[3:07:54] <ShoggothLord> @doc_ock_rokc How so?

[3:08:21] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> it sucks
[3:08:23] <JittersCaffeine> Why not just set her to pistols only?
[3:08:26] <mankeyfigh> Don't play with YOUR FOOOD
[3:08:26] <Rosy_Joan> TIME TO STAB EVERYONE HERE
[3:08:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it's supper tiiiiiiiime
[3:08:29] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> THE ANATHAME

[3:08:33] <Djinnazz> wow, it's not even closed.
[3:08:33] <%linSP> i didnt have enough speech for this one
[3:08:38] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Why is it in these games whenever you find cannibals trying to hide being cannibals it's always super obvious?
[3:08:39] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> THE FUCKING SWORD THAT KILLED HORUS
[3:08:41] <+SleazyShell> MURDER
[3:08:41] <mor3gan> Make a RE7 joke
[3:08:42] <@lewdskeletor13> Cannibal weapons good
[3:08:43] <+DashXero> Weapon at the ready, please.
[3:08:43] <%AncelDeLambert> who needs speech? Kill'em
[3:08:48] <+brightman42> guns out
[3:08:49] <@lewdskeletor13> Welcome to the family son
[3:09:03] <%AncelDeLambert> we can't leave, there's killin' to do
[3:09:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> @screamlord The prions make them not smart
[3:09:10] <abakkus> unibrow cannibal cult
[3:09:11] <%AncelDeLambert> YOU TOLD ME TO WALK AROUND
[3:09:14] <dukenux> oh dear you gonna die
[3:09:17] <JittersCaffeine> I think I just snuck out of the house
[3:09:30] <%linSP> now EAT THEM
[3:09:33] <ScreamLord> @GeneralSCPatton Oh yeah, that actually makes sense
[3:09:35] <%AncelDeLambert> AIM, Pat
[3:09:40] <TheMorilo> based max
[3:09:41] <+AnsonSioux> oof
[3:09:41] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> YEEEAH
[3:09:42] <%SvenHolgersson> JESUS
[3:09:43] <%Parapattern> PFFFT
[3:09:44] <Djinnazz> Nice one Max
[3:09:45] <%AncelDeLambert> HOLY SHIT
[3:09:45] <misterspotswood> i went to the bathroom, were they cannibals?
[3:09:45] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> GO MAX
[3:09:46] <Zebroneath> That was amazingly shot
[3:09:46] <heartlesshealer> that's a good fight ender!
[3:09:46] <SpaceGuntank> DESTROYED
[3:09:46] <SleepyMaribo> Moon Gang!
[3:09:47] <+brightman42> nice
[3:09:47] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> told
[3:09:48] <AbysmalWulf> niiiice
[3:09:52] <%SvenHolgersson> SUPPER TIMEEE
[3:09:52] <$RubberFistFight> NOW EAT THEM TO GAIN THEIR CANNIBAL POWER
[3:09:52] <Rosy_Joan> YEEAAAHH MAX
[3:09:55] <dekkitout> That was a pretty well positioned shot
[3:09:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> MOON GANG
[3:09:58] <mor3gan> how cliche
[3:09:59] <Balsty> MEET MY RELIGION, A SHOTGUN
[3:09:59] <%derap41> Good deed for the day done
[3:10:00] <mankeyfigh> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[3:10:00] <%lotharrio> "Sometimes the true violence is the MOON GANG we got along the way."
[3:10:03] <+brightman42> the gang murders a family
[3:10:05] <%honeyman18> NOW EAT THEM!
[3:10:06] <JittersCaffeine> I remember velma being a bitch
[3:10:08] <GlassesFreek> Man, I talked to him for WAY longer than that after I found the body
[3:10:09] <@lewdskeletor13> I talked my way out of it and promised them I’d bring more people for them to eat LUL
[3:10:15] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Do you think they serve kosher in this place?
[3:10:16] <dukenux> cannibal perk would be handy
[3:10:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ShoggothLord they didn't really meet much native americans. They traveled a path that a smooth talker theorized would be faster but went through uncharted and terrible terrain got lost because of a snow storm and then their lead expert on the area got snow blindness
[3:10:18] <heartlesshealer> yes, @misterspotswood
[3:10:24] <%SvenHolgersson> LUL
[3:10:28] <GlassesFreek> @lewdskeletor13 same
[3:10:30] <dekkitout> SWEET
[3:10:31] <dukenux> WTF is that WoW sword
[3:10:31] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> yeah you can do that
[3:10:32] <%Parapattern> "To shreds, you say?"
[3:10:33] <%SvenHolgersson> No thats genius
[3:10:35] <+SleazyShell> Yeah and then I shot them
[3:10:35] <TheMorilo> But did you bring more people?
[3:10:36] <%linSP> snuck out missed out on xp
[3:10:36] <%Ner234> @lewdskeletor13 You madman
[3:10:47] <%Undenizen> @AngriestPat what are your thoughts on cannibalism while people are in desperate circumstance?
[3:10:50] <GlassesFreek> This game's got nothing on Disco Elysium tho
[3:10:51] <JittersCaffeine> What IS Disco Elysium? I keep hearing the name but no one has given me a description yet
[3:10:52] <%SvenHolgersson> WRPGs Aint dead yet
[3:10:56] <%Mr_Pylon> Going through Disco now, can't wait to Outer Worlds
[3:10:56] <+BlockingDisabled> I'm playing Fallout 2 right now
[3:11:00] <mor3gan> Yes, mailman-sim is my favorite RPG
[3:11:00] <+G_Thunders> Well half of Edgewater probably turned to cannibalism by now, so...
[3:11:01] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I do like htat
[3:11:05] <%honeyman18> ELYSIUM is more a talking simulator, no combat
[3:11:05] <%Ner234> No Max
[3:11:07] <+brightman42> disco is a crpg
[3:11:14] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Not sure if you've heard of Hazbin Hotel, but a funny bit of lore for that is that there is a designated area in Hell specifically for Canadians and all Canadians in hell are cannibals
[3:11:17] <%SvenHolgersson> Max is such a dad I love him
[3:11:18] <dekkitout> First it was back to back astral bs, now it's back to back nerdy rpgs
[3:11:18] <%simulationbard> @JittersCaffeine Pat did a stream of it the other daym it's a crpg
[3:11:18] <+SleazyShell> I fuckin love dumb nerd crap and so do you
[3:11:23] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Would you consider this an AA title?
[3:11:42] <mor3gan> and thats a good thing
[3:11:42] <@lewdskeletor13> This game was made by like a 70 person team
[3:11:47] <%GeneralSCPatton> @screamlord That's great. Also, Angel Dust is best waifu
[3:11:49] <KaiserMario> It's great
[3:11:49] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I didnt even think about that AA is back! I missed it
[3:11:52] <Seraphile> i really hope this game gets a Old World Blues level expansion
[3:11:53] <ScreamLord> We need more good AA, A, and B titles
[3:11:56] <%AncelDeLambert> remember the days of "Midware"? yeah, this is midware
[3:11:57] <%derap41> Are these games still called immersive sims/451 games or has the name changed
[3:12:05] <%Undenizen> @ScreamLord there was way too much hype over that thing. it was good, but not THAT good.
[3:12:12] <%SvenHolgersson> YOU SHOULD
[3:12:13] <@lewdskeletor13> @seraphile Me too, I think it will
[3:12:15] <osiris1260> she's cranky because your killing the town
[3:12:17] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> yeah don't you biiiitch
[3:12:18] <viciousgrim> you still have Divinity: Original Sin 2 to play pat
[3:12:23] <$Tarcanist_> i built my character like dolph lundgren(all int and str) and named him space lundgren
[3:12:39] <+trustycoyote> She's really torn up about it
[3:12:40] <dekkitout> I get pretty apathetic too when I'm sweepy
[3:12:45] <JittersCaffeine> Did Pat get the poster from her yet?
[3:12:47] <KaiserMario> @ScreamLord We got Metal Wolf Chaos XD, and Deadly Premonition 2 is coming out soon
[3:12:51] <Monkeyweed21> Why does pat hate new companions
[3:12:54] <ScreamLord> @Undenizen True, but I really hope to see more someday
[3:12:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @JittersCaffeine yes
[3:12:55] <Seraphile> D:OS 2 isnt as strong on the narrative front
[3:13:03] <%derap41> Parvati quest
[3:13:06] <%honeyman18> Thieves and Communists on this planet
[3:13:06] <%around_40_jobbers> let me just say that doing a psycho run is WAY faster than legit
[3:13:09] <Seraphile> but probably the best CRPG mechanically
[3:13:32] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Parvati cake
[3:13:38] <+brightman42> d:os2 is great, second that sentiment
[3:13:40] <JittersCaffeine> @doc_ock_rokc cool. I think I completed that part and this quest all at the same time and got some different dialogue
[3:13:44] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Asexual munchies
[3:13:49] <+brightman42> casserole
[3:13:50] <dukenux> why theres so much piss talk in this game
[3:14:11] <%derap41> Hire this guy to cook
[3:14:21] <%honeyman18> @dukenux David Cage's influence on Modern Games
[3:14:22] <dukenux> ship cook
[3:14:51] <%Ner234> 3000?!
[3:14:55] <%MelBrooksKA> yes
[3:15:00] <dukenux> aw ye, birscht
[3:15:04] <%derap41> Make him shit himself
[3:15:05] <%MaddyCaddy> What if it's really good?
[3:15:08] <dekkitout> It's for Vati tho....
[3:15:11] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> people have died for less
[3:15:18] <DrFacilier> wow Pat, typical boomer complaining about food prices
[3:15:19] <ShoggothLord> Oof, that was a wall-o-text.
[3:15:21] <+brightman42> it's an amazing casserole
[3:15:24] <dukenux> reminds me of 9000 gold jerky from Chrono Trigger
[3:15:24] <mor3gan> I'd spend 3000 for a night with your MOM
[3:15:26] <%MightyMaxT> I paid 3000 for them because Pavarti
[3:15:27] <%foreverN2dust> he just pawn stared you
[3:15:28] <%Undenizen> a suit of armor is like 400.
[3:15:31] <%derap41> you could buy like 3 guns for that
[3:15:36] <osiris1260> I get the feeling you shouldn't have messed with the factory boss, since they are kinda the only thing keeping the planet alive and the workers can skip whenever they want now
[3:15:37] <JittersCaffeine> Does Pat have the option on that shows you speech options even if you don't have the skill to complete them?
[3:15:44] <+SleazyShell> That is how cooking works, thanks
[3:15:47] <TheApeGatsby> Parvati gets mad at you if you intimidate there lol
[3:16:00] <42nfl19> Will @AngriestPat be the best wingman?
[3:16:01] <%derap41> They're just marking their territory
[3:16:05] <%Undenizen> this man talks about piss a lot.
[3:16:19] <mor3gan> 10 hours, kek
[3:16:21] <%CrabSlacks> double the oven temp for half the cook time
[3:16:24] <Seraphile> this guy has the same hat as greasy
[3:16:25] <Solidnick18> man i don't like monarch...
[3:16:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @CrabSlacks that isn't how chemistry works
[3:16:37] <$RubberFistFight> @Undenizen you know they used to piss on leather to harden it up?
[3:16:44] <%Undenizen> @CrabSlacks 9 women can make a baby in 1 month.
[3:16:47] <tinypouf> remy from ratatouille would kick this man's ass
[3:16:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> Enclave?
[3:16:54] <%derap41> Edgewater was way worse
[3:16:54] <JittersCaffeine> @Solidnick18 I still appreciated solving the place diplomatically
[3:17:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> Anyone else want fish
[3:17:07] <%derap41> These people actually have fish
[3:17:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> I want fish now
[3:17:11] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Send him to edgewater
[3:17:13] <Zebroneath> Doesn't sound goo, coming from Max's religious viewpoint.
[3:17:16] <Monkeyweed21> Why does Pat hate Nyoka?
[3:17:17] <Zebroneath> good*
[3:17:20] <heartlesshealer> bin?
[3:17:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> at least they had ACTUAL fish to turn into saltuna
[3:17:25] <Seraphile> greasy straight out murdered a man but was still a more pleasant chef
[3:17:29] <%Kiiper> Nyoka is the actual worst
[3:17:36] <Futurecity10> Nyoka sucks
[3:17:38] <%Undenizen> @RubberFistFight I did not! I might try it next time I'm tanning something
[3:17:39] <@lewdskeletor13> apatWrong
[3:17:39] <%honeyman18> WOO
[3:17:42] <JittersCaffeine> Nyoka is fine. I just don't use her much
[3:17:42] <%derap41> I don't think any one likes her
[3:17:44] <+SleazyShell> New companion? Nyo kan do
[3:17:45] <Futurecity10> I left Nyoka there to rot
[3:17:52] <%honeyman18> Drunk Bitch Time
[3:17:54] <%Piemen99> !uptime
[3:17:54] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 17m.
[3:18:01] <+griffball13> bitchy red head time
[3:18:01] <%derap41> She has one funny scene at least
[3:18:04] <Seraphile> Nyoka has a lot of good dialouge for monarch
[3:18:06] <mor3gan> Nyoka more like gnocchi
[3:18:06] <%Kiiper> I used her for her quests and then sent her off to drink herself to death
[3:18:14] <%SvenHolgersson> GIRL WOOLIE
[3:18:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Jesus you have enough bullets for every man woman and child in this planet
[3:18:22] <Sokumotanaka> BEST GIRL
[3:18:24] <Seraphile> Nyoka+S.A.M is great
[3:18:29] <SnakeVash> I normally wait for these on YouTube
[3:18:38] <+brightman42> girl woolie indeed
[3:18:41] <@lewdskeletor13> @snakevash Glad you’re here!

[3:25:51] <%Bane_Kaikyo> every time
[3:25:54] <dukenux> no-knees Patron
[3:26:01] <%SvenHolgersson> MY SHINS
[3:26:06] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> This is how Pat got short isnt it
[3:26:08] <%derap41> You're gonna need Forrest braces in a month
[3:26:08] <@lewdskeletor13> Patron is gonna get Arthritis
[3:26:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat isn't used to having Normal legs
[3:26:19] <%honeyman18> Sam killing %44 of all germs on the ship
[3:26:21] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Wait, does the Robot have a little moon face on his face place?
[3:26:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> new flaw: baby legs
[3:26:32] <+shamchimp> Always inspiring to see the captian blow his fucking knees out
[3:26:46] <JittersCaffeine> You're in the wrong tab
[3:26:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> did u upgrade ellies handgun?
[3:26:53] <%MightyMaxT> You just unequipped your mods
[3:26:54] <mankeyfigh> Ah message was too spoilery, my bad
[3:27:12] <%derap41> ol reliable maxes out at like 2500 dps
[3:27:16] <Solidnick18> i found the raptdon't big machine gun and it's been doing work
[3:27:16] <%Ner234> Are there any major differences between Male or Female player characters in terms of interactions/scenaios?
[3:27:34] <JittersCaffeine> Maybe if you tinker it
[3:27:34] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Please, Did the robot fave a Moon Goon Face Place?
[3:27:36] <@lewdskeletor13> @ner234 Not really
[3:27:36] <$Tarcanist_> yes
[3:27:42] <%honeyman18> Low DPS
[3:27:43] <JittersCaffeine> It's probably pretty low level
[3:27:43] <RushUnplugged> uniques don't get mods, don't they
[3:27:45] <%derap41> more damage slower firerate
[3:27:55] <%Ner234> @lewdskeletor13 I see. Thanks
[3:28:00] <+sixcubit> are you running a pissbaby with all possible flaws?
[3:28:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> You can't mod any unique stuff
[3:28:06] <%lotharrio> Named weapons don't get mods, and because they spawn in at fixed levels, tinkering them up can be more expensive.
[3:28:10] <%honeyman18> Pat HEAVY MACHINE GUN
[3:28:10] <LeauxAyeQueue> uniques get upgrades but no mods
[3:28:13] <%derap41> Best damage outside of prism hammer is heavy machine gun with firerate mod
[3:28:13] <sire_nukerre> tinkering levels them up, but if you don't specc in size it's gonna deprecate real fast
[3:28:18] <%conradical> uniques have mods already built into them
[3:28:25] <sire_nukerre> *apec in science
[3:28:30] <Solidnick18> you can up the damage that's about it
[3:28:31] <%nekodelic> some uniques get mods
[3:28:39] <mankeyfigh> Uhh, can you take clothes off your crew?
[3:28:40] <Monkeyweed21> BLIND
[3:28:42] <sire_nukerre> oh god the typos sbfpSetIn

[3:29:28] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Japanese Spider-Man is confirmed for Spiderverse 2

[3:29:47] <%lotharrio> ...which Japanese Spider-Man, @QueequegTheater ? The one with the mecha?
[3:29:49] <%Kiiper> 80 weight? how
[3:29:49] <%MightyMaxT> I do it too, it's annoying
[3:29:59] <%QueequegTheater> @lotharrio the original live action one
[3:30:14] <%lotharrio> Nice. I hope he calls himself the Emissary of Hell.
[3:30:18] <JittersCaffeine> @Kiiper He's techinically running solo right now since he's on the ship
[3:30:20] <SnakeVash> Inventory is a mess
[3:30:22] <KaiserMario> YES the one with the giant robot leopardon
[3:30:27] <Kiiper> Oh, I'm a dumbass
[3:30:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> Supaida-Man!
[3:30:37] <%derap41> Mark 2 and ultra is as high a level as weapons get so feel free to tinker them
[3:30:39] <Djinnazz> Because you're a hoarder
[3:30:51] <asurite_warrior> @AngriestPat I just beat the game an hour ago. Pretty good overall. I hope they do some DLC or announce a number 2
[3:30:52] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat Just sell literally every weapon you aren't using
[3:30:53] <+MysteriousDrX> stims have weight
[3:31:04] <%derap41> @MysteriousDrX only on nova
[3:31:05] <sire_nukerre> Mark 2, 2.0, Gold and Ultra isn't it
[3:31:13] <JittersCaffeine> @QueequegTheater Right?
[3:31:17] <@lewdskeletor13> I sincerely hope this game gets New Vegas style DLCs
[3:31:23] <%QueequegTheater> Wait who's that third companion and where do I get them

[3:34:17] <JittersCaffeine> Companions are just grenades with action barks
[3:34:18] <dekkitout> She's what I like to call a 'functioning alcoholic'- like Archer
[3:34:24] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Fashion Worlds
[3:34:27] <Seraphile> shes got lots of good dialogue for monarch

[3:38:27] <+trustycoyote> Love touches like that
[3:38:28] <sire_nukerre> and that's why French is banned
[3:38:31] <%derap41> But french is ancient dead language
[3:38:31] <%lotharrio> It's a dead language for hippies.
[3:38:33] <@lewdskeletor13> French? I can’t read fucking french!

[3:55:50] <42nfl19> This is like Hermes Conrad.
[3:55:52] <%Ner234> BLACKMAIL IS COOL TOO
[3:55:56] <dekkitout> Even better!
[3:55:57] <%derap41> Just a little bit of black mail
[3:55:58] <JittersCaffeine> "Hooray! Negotoations!"
[3:56:04] <Nyemmers> yeah! blackmail!
[3:56:10] <Djinnazz> Yeah! Blackmail!
[3:56:31] <%derap41> That smirk
[3:56:38] <+griffball13> hooray for blackmail
[3:56:38] <%JohnAtDawn> When he says Bolt it sounds like vault and I can't imagine that's unintentional.
[3:56:47] <%Ner234> Blackmail is such an ugly word. I prefer extortion.
[3:56:51] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Date Sanjar
[3:56:57] <xGeneralDOOM> Bruh
[3:56:59] <dekkitout> I prefer 'finessing'

[3:57:30] <TheMorilo> Sanjar is awesome
[3:57:36] <%WackyGear> I second that romance him
[3:57:40] <42nfl19> But is it MOON MAN WORTHY?
[3:57:41] <%Neo_Kaiser> But he's got a new hat!
[3:57:41] <42nfl19> no
[3:57:44] <+griffball13> RACIST
[3:57:49] <%derap41> Think you can buy MSI weapons now
[3:57:52] <%AncelDeLambert> Please, it's not "kidnapping"! It's "indefinite detainment of personnel." Heavens.
[3:57:57] <+blitzrush1200> Robotism
[3:58:00] <+griffball13> robots rise up
[3:58:03] <Seraphile> SAM has so much sass for nyoka
[3:58:04] <%Ner234> SAM monkaS
[3:58:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ROBO RACISM
[3:58:07] <Edible_Enthusiasm> they both have robophobia
[3:58:09] <@lewdskeletor13> Don’t bulli SAM
[3:58:13] <TheMorilo> vending machine
[3:58:13] <%derap41> the lady there
[3:58:14] <%bread_assassin> This is clear robophobia.
[3:58:15] <%GarbageNirvana> Vending machines have em
[3:58:17] <+griffball13> prob a vending machine
[3:58:18] <%AncelDeLambert> hey cutie
[3:58:20] <%Jrocy247> At MSI shops.......
[3:58:24] <dekkitout> I think Max has been hitting Nyoka's stash...
[3:58:29] <CrypticMochi> It’s not blackmail, it’s financial advice
[3:58:37] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> HATS
[3:58:40] <%derap41> those are the MSI ines
[3:58:43] <%AncelDeLambert> Wrench Wenches forever
[3:58:51] <%honeyman18> Any MSI vending machine, also the RIZZOS sells Candy!
[3:58:54] <misterspotswood> TOSSBALL CAP, PAT
[3:59:08] <%derap41> She was selling them
[3:59:10] <@lewdskeletor13> Baseball? What a fake fan, it’s tossball
[3:59:10] <BlacSoul> lookin for a Tam'o'Shanter?
[3:59:16] <%honeyman18> CURDS
[3:59:18] <@lewdskeletor13> cryShrug
[3:59:20] <%lotharrio> I remember Rizzo armor being really good at this point.
[3:59:26] <Dakuu75> bioshock vibes
[3:59:26] <%derap41> weapons on the top
[3:59:39] <@commanderclaw> Better stats
[3:59:44] <+Maleicus> the brand
[3:59:44] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> but its made my msi
[3:59:45] <Zinax7> geez the weapon variety is not much huh
[3:59:46] <%derap41> they're worse than mark 2 -_-*
[4:00:05] <%cmdrmobium> I don't think I ever bought a gun in this game
[4:00:22] <Zinax7> what's the use of unique weapons then?
[4:00:28] <Edible_Enthusiasm> but. brand recognition, or whatever
[4:00:28] <RushUnplugged> shotgun are sadly pretty disappointing
[4:00:30] <Dakuu75> i think Pat might've stolen more guns, than you bought~
[4:00:31] <CurrySauseBandit> Unique effects.
[4:00:31] <%honeyman18> C&P is basically Canada, they have curds and Maple Syrup
[4:00:36] <JittersCaffeine> I believe Felix has dialogue in Amber Hights
[4:00:38] <Dakuu75> he*
[4:00:42] <Crashtronaut> I only bought a heavy machine gun II because it showed up first
[4:00:44] <buffn99> Is this Pat's first playthrough?
[4:00:51] <Crashtronaut> Yes
[4:00:53] <@lewdskeletor13> Yes
[4:00:58] <%WackyGear> hi Pat
[4:00:59] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> hi
[4:00:59] <%derap41> @Zinax7 some have special effects but they don't say explicitly what they are sometimes
[4:01:02] <+griffball13> pat was a saw once
[4:01:04] <+Maleicus> why hello pat
[4:01:09] <+Maleicus> didnt see you there
[4:01:23] <Zinax7> @derap41 so they'll get easily outclassed even with the effects?
[4:01:23] <$SuperiorDelta> Pat are you excited to see the Terry news tomorrow?
[4:01:43] <+griffball13> why indeed pat
[4:01:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> in case you go Iconoclast
[4:01:51] <TechDragon_Z> For reasons
[4:01:51] <Edible_Enthusiasm> terrycloth
[4:01:52] <+blitzrush1200> Just cause
[4:01:56] <%Maids4lyfe> because some people need to sneak in
[4:01:57] <%derap41> @Zinax7 not if you tinker them to be the same level but sometimes mods make the normal ones better so it kinda depends
[4:01:59] <+theotherkristian> EVERYONE shut up
[4:02:04] <+theotherkristian> jk love
[4:02:13] <JittersCaffeine> You're on the other side
[4:02:15] <@commanderclaw> South, not north
[4:02:22] <%juxtest> That entrance is for people who dont like saltuna
[4:02:34] <Djinnazz> the spread on that gun is awuful.
[4:02:43] <Seraphile> max casually feeling himself
[4:02:48] <%honeyman18> WEAK
[4:02:56] <%Maids4lyfe> is there a carry weight limit in this game?
[4:03:00] <@lewdskeletor13> Yes
[4:03:06] <+theotherkristian> mY e
[4:03:07] <Zinax7> @AngriestPat do you like that the loot drops are random?
[4:03:12] <%Maids4lyfe> dang
[4:03:14] <%MightyMaxT> Yes but you can upgrade it multiple times
[4:03:21] <%cmdrmobium> It's pretty forgiving though, especially if you use companions
[4:03:32] <Djinnazz> Kickin ass for the lord!
[4:03:32] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> boy got smited
[4:03:34] <+AnsonSioux> smited
[4:03:37] <sire_nukerre> get smote
[4:03:42] <Edible_Enthusiasm> why does he always need to turn around
[4:03:43] <+theotherkristian> smitten
[4:03:44] <+griffball13> burned by rightest fire
[4:03:47] <JittersCaffeine> "I'll smite you in the name of the Law" sounds like something from a D&D game
[4:03:51] <%derap41> looks cool
[4:03:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> SMOTE
[4:03:52] <@lewdskeletor13> @edible_enthusiasm Cause it’s cool
[4:03:58] <dekkitout> How hath Law smitted Pat
[4:04:00] <%honeyman18> I meant the marauders, but every weapon is okay at max level.
[4:04:01] <+theotherkristian> smeet
[4:04:09] <Zinax7> kinda wish companion characters have more than one special move
[4:04:22] <Crashtronaut> I mean, max is literally a paladin
[4:04:37] <grimrjak> he turns te other checks and blasts them
[4:04:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> The Law is very fuzzy on the subject of kneecaps
[4:04:44] <Nyemmers> your name: john law, corporate marine
[4:04:45] <Zinax7> is pat playing on normal?
[4:04:50] <@lewdskeletor13> Yes
[4:04:53] <NeroInfinite> yes
[4:05:03] <+HeyBoston> lmao
[4:05:03] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[4:05:05] <Zinax7> welp
[4:05:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> Some fucking lookout
[4:05:06] <sire_nukerre> lmao
[4:05:07] <+AnsonSioux> dead huh?
[4:05:07] <JittersCaffeine> good job "lookout"
[4:05:10] <Djinnazz> where the fuvk he come from?!
[4:05:11] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[4:05:15] <%GarbageNirvana> Hey
[4:05:16] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Pat. lookout
[4:05:19] <%GarbageNirvana> Look out kappa
[4:05:21] <Zinax7> looks too easy for normal
[4:05:23] <$RubberFistFight> Hahah that's happened to me so many times.
[4:05:24] <Paperware> That happens ALOT in this map
[4:05:25] <%torontototoro> has Pat picked a side on Monarch yet?
[4:05:29] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat oh no pat look out Kappa
[4:05:31] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Do you not care for the game difficulty because it's just an increase in numbers, or you just like cruising?
[4:05:33] <DecuScrub69> That guy was a lookout
[4:05:38] <%CrabSlacks> had his earpods in
[4:05:42] <%lotharrio> @torontototoro He likes Sanjar, and hasn't met the other side.
[4:05:43] <sire_nukerre> Look out, a lookout!
[4:05:44] <xGeneralDOOM> is this easy mode
[4:05:46] <JittersCaffeine> @torontototoro He hasn't met both sides yet
[4:05:46] <%cmdrmobium> @torontototoro he just left Stellar bay for the first time
[4:05:47] <%penguinsarefly> Supernova playthrough when??
[4:05:50] <%GarbageNirvana> dang kappatalization
[4:05:52] <Djinnazz> @CrabSlacks lol
[4:05:56] <+Curse7781> Dude didn’t see/hear his buddies getting shot
[4:05:58] <+AnsonSioux> @KaiserMario translation hes a chump LUL
[4:06:01] <%torontototoro> @lotharrio thanks. who couldn't love Sanjar?!
[4:06:11] <Zinax7> sanjar is a tool
[4:06:16] <KaiserMario> @AnsonSioux LUL
[4:06:29] <Edible_Enthusiasm> weren't one of those your fancy new helmet
[4:06:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> Sanjar is a good tool though
[4:06:31] <%derap41> Sanjar is trying his best
[4:06:33] <%torontototoro> Sanjar is by far the best charact-ar
[4:06:35] <%Kiiper> Sanjar is great and Graham is useless to everyone
[4:06:43] <%torontototoro> on Monarch at least
[4:06:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> Sanjar is best boi
[4:06:53] <+YEAHJEETS> ResidentSleeper this game is digital melatonin
[4:06:54] <Seraphile> graham is [redacted]
[4:06:54] <TheMorilo> sanjar is a hero
[4:07:01] <%torontototoro> Best boi and best girl in this game are both south asian. coincidence?
[4:07:05] <Seraphile> i have very little positive to say about graham
[4:07:06] <+Curse7781> @angriestpat How is the gun play in your opinion?
[4:07:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Sanjar is a SLIGHT tool, but all of the people to compare him to are basically eating babies
[4:07:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @YEAHJEETS I wish then I might be able to get some sleep
[4:07:20] <ShoggothLord> Sanjar is wellmeaning but misguided, which I can at least respect
[4:07:24] <Crashtronaut> @yeahjeets Not wrong, at least most of it is good
[4:07:31] <Zinax7> graham's aide is where it's at
[4:07:34] <JittersCaffeine> What horrible accident must have happened?
[4:07:46] <Zinax7> graham was made to be hateable
[4:07:48] <@lewdskeletor13> Who killed Hannibal?
[4:07:54] <Djinnazz> Lookouts skill checks are lacking
[4:07:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> Sanjar is a person who got to a good idea via the wrong method but he still thinks the idea is good
[4:07:58] <%derap41> Yeah they wanted trees but got mushrooms
[4:07:58] <%torontototoro> Graham is a cracker!
[4:07:58] <%GarbageNirvana> Phineas said it was terraformed badly when he called you on Edgewater
[4:08:00] <%honeyman18> How agonizing must it be to have your brain eaten by an acid bullet as you slowly die, I prefer radiation that melts their guts.
[4:08:03] <illTemperedSeaBass> Does Spacer's Choice make good explosives? I would imagine so, given how many shapes they make them in. The gun-shaped explosives are particular neat.
[4:08:08] <JittersCaffeine> nope
[4:08:10] <%foreverN2dust> yeah, no way
[4:08:10] <+HeyBoston> absilutely not
[4:08:12] <LeauxAyeQueue> It's Spacer's Choice.
[4:08:13] <%Jrocy247> NOPE
[4:08:14] <illTemperedSeaBass> *particularly
[4:08:14] <+griffball13> ya probably not
[4:08:16] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat not even close
[4:08:16] <%MaddyCaddy> If you rush it you can
[4:08:17] <+HeyBoston> absolutely
[4:08:17] <Edible_Enthusiasm> I guess you'll have to take a break
[4:08:18] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> oh yeag
[4:08:19] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Stream harder, bitch
[4:08:19] <Seraphile> i mean
[4:08:19] <+DashXero> Not with that attitude.
[4:08:19] <%derap41> It speeds up after Monarch
[4:08:22] <Zinax7> you can rush the quests tho
[4:08:23] <%MaddyCaddy> You're pretty close to the end
[4:08:24] <+JacktheMan18> Just do a 24hr stream 4Head
[4:08:25] <dekkitout> Instead of edenic colony, someone set the terraformer to sulfuric hellscape
[4:08:26] <Seraphile> if you piss of byzantium
[4:08:26] <%Kiiper> You have a solid 10-15 left
[4:08:28] <KaiserMario> Does anyone know what percentage he's at? Whisper me for not spoilers
[4:08:29] <+Vanillabeanwonder> Did this guy get the early pass for Outer Wilds?!
[4:08:30] <Seraphile> that will cut some time off
[4:08:31] <Crashtronaut> It dawns on him
[4:08:31] <%lotharrio> Monarch is the longest planet/arc.
[4:08:32] <+korth367> just skip all the side quests PogChamp PogChamp
[4:08:32] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat Without spoilering anything, You're halfway there
[4:08:33] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you got no choice then man, 24 hour streams, GO
[4:08:35] <TheyCallMeVawn> Stream harder pussy
[4:08:35] <$RubberFistFight> :P
[4:08:35] <%MaddyCaddy> about 60%
[4:08:37] <%Parapattern> Unless you motor it through the main mission, no
[4:08:38] <Zinax7> so much for finishing it before ds
[4:08:41] <EuropanLamprey> 10 hour stream
[4:08:41] <%torontototoro> @AngriestPat you can always pull a DS3 and grind off-stream. Game takes 20-30 hours to beat
[4:08:41] <+griffball13> 24-hour stream lets go
[4:08:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Does doing super long streams count as rushing it?
[4:08:50] <+HeyBoston> that man is _dead_
[4:08:50] <TheMorilo> 24 hour stream
[4:08:50] <%honeyman18> It's a good one, take your time. Slow week comming.
[4:08:51] <+blitzrush1200> Byzantium is pretty fast if you only do main story missions
[4:08:51] <Seraphile> i really hope you talk to graham today
[4:08:54] <+Curse7781> @angriestpat you are better off not playing Death’s Stranding given the mixed opinions
[4:08:59] <%derap41> Monarch is the longest section and you're like 50% trough
[4:08:59] <JittersCaffeine> It must really suck to be killed with acid bullets
[4:09:00] <%penguinsarefly> I kinda wish this game had a telltale like results screen at the end
[4:09:02] <Zinax7> any idea when they're gonna make an expansion for the game?
[4:09:02] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat Pat, do you want an actually legit progress point you're at?
[4:09:13] <%MightyMaxT> Do we have an estimated length of Death Stranding?
[4:09:16] <+blitzrush1200> 60ish to 70
[4:09:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> @dekkitout I like that. I'm gonna use sulfuric hellscape the first chance I get.
[4:09:19] <%cmdrmobium> @Curse7781 No I really want Pat to play DS so I don't have to
[4:09:19] <%MaddyCaddy> IMO 60%
[4:09:21] <%derap41> that place is super shrot
[4:09:21] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat You're at the 75% mark
[4:09:23] <TheMorilo> 60
[4:09:23] <Zinax7> I NEED the microsoft bucks polished expansion
[4:09:23] <%torontototoro> Yeah Monarch is the biggest, best area. Byzantium onwards is like 25% of the game, maybe less
[4:09:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah.
[4:09:31] <+Curse7781> @mightymaxt Supposedly 40-50 hours
[4:09:33] <%lotharrio> Byzantium is like Groundbreaker-length.
[4:09:34] <Seraphile> monarch content wise is 40% of the game
[4:09:35] <+theotherkristian> 65%
[4:09:35] <@lewdskeletor13> If you rush it you could beat it, but if you want to take your time I’d definitely say you won’t finish before Death Stranding
[4:09:41] <%honeyman18> I bet Hephestus, it screams good story. Miner Planet that never gets used.
[4:09:42] <KaiserMario> @Curse7781 I think it's worth at least a quick look
[4:09:43] <@commanderclaw> Once you finish off monarch you're at like, 80%
[4:09:49] <%AncelDeLambert> wait, so all the other planets in the solar map are just red herrings? Well that fucking blows!
[4:09:49] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat Monarch is the last big area like this, and Byzantium is a city
[4:09:51] <TheMorilo> graham incoming
[4:09:54] <%torontototoro> so many pointless, skippable sidequests on Byzantium too. You can totally rush to the finale
[4:09:57] <+griffball13> CULT
[4:09:58] <+HeyBoston> lmao\
[4:10:00] <%derap41> Whole game you're at like 70-80%
[4:10:02] <%honeyman18> DLC maybe
[4:10:03] <Dakuu75> @MightyMaxT "a lot" is all I can gather. Maybe a upwards of 60-80+ hours, one of those big chunky type things if you do everything
[4:10:03] <Seraphile> god i cant wait to see pats reaction to graham
[4:10:05] <+Kurvera> KILL HER
[4:10:07] <+Kurvera> BIG MURDER
[4:10:07] <%1buckboom> 1buckboom subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! Yo I'll have to watch you play this later my dude as I'm also playing through but this game is amazing!
[4:10:07] <%MightyMaxT> Pamphlet = BAD
[4:10:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ehhhh...scylla...didn't have much on it from my experience
[4:10:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is a cult
[4:10:08] <Djinnazz> Jehova's Witnesses! RUN!
[4:10:09] <%AncelDeLambert> these people are... they're okayish
[4:10:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> THIS IS A CULT
[4:10:13] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> LORGAR
[4:10:13] <%lotharrio> Scylla only has about two story things involved in them, and they're both over quick.
[4:10:14] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat IF Death Stranding is not stream poison, RIGHT?

[4:11:32] <%rumtumtugnutz> Graham is a character for true.
[4:11:33] <+MisterRockett> @AngriestPat I am SO GLAD you brought Vicar here you're in for a treat when you meet their leader.
[4:11:37] <KaiserMario> @Curse7781 I'm considering doing just that, but I also believe Kojima deserves some support for his first post-konami project... So I'm getting some mixed feelings...
[4:11:37] <Zinax7> vicar and sam makes this place more interesting
[4:11:39] <Seraphile> @torontototoro i never did that
[4:11:39] <+HeyBoston> that's how I signed my journal when I was ten

[4:14:02] <Seraphile> @AngriestPat you can fix the terminal
[4:14:03] <%torontototoro> @AngriestPat please, please for the love of god talk to Graham with Max in your party
[4:14:07] <Dakuu75> this place seems very Cult-y. Mind your Shooreh Pippi
[4:14:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> For real, though. Graham sure is a guy in this game.
[4:14:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> They are Board Cultists!
[4:14:17] <%cmdrmobium> I always wonder who the hell is supplying these vending machines
[4:14:19] <+korth367> video games
[4:14:21] <%derap41> Cause they're posers
[4:14:22] <+rdark_ksu> question not the vending machines as they are as gods to us
[4:14:32] <leinadtonu> A Rick and Morty death stranding ad... Oh boy.
[4:14:36] <@lewdskeletor13> For gameplay reasons
[4:14:41] <%honeyman18> It's like an abandoned gas station with a stocked snack machine.
[4:14:48] <Djinnazz> Ok, lets eat the baby
[4:14:50] <sire_nukerre> I mean, you see vending machines everywhere
[4:14:54] <sire_nukerre> most of them broken

[4:15:00] <dekkitout> @leinadtonu That really exists?
[4:15:02] <sire_nukerre> so they just have lots
[4:15:08] <illTemperedSeaBass> Is he saying "Philosophists"? Denoting "Philosophy" as some kind of religion?
[4:15:09] <%Tucker0603> SICKASS ARMOR
[4:15:11] <osiris1260> read Grahams terminal when you meet him
[4:15:11] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I wish we had vending machines everywhere Japan style in the states. Anything to avoid clerk interaction
[4:15:13] <@commanderclaw> Agitator, Rioter, Revolutionary
[4:15:16] <%torontototoro> their armour honestly is the coolest looking in the game
[4:15:19] <%derap41> Go buy it
[4:15:21] <%torontototoro> the corporate armour is laaaaame
[4:15:24] <Crashtronaut> It’s what they call themselves
[4:15:42] <%juxtest> They have a flag and a logo? I thought they were supposed to oclast icons like that.
[4:15:47] <leinadtonu> @dekkitout yup, just saw it.
[4:16:02] <%honeyman18> Good Muisc here
[4:16:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @illTemperedSeaBass Yeah philosiphy has become a religion and deterministic philosophy in particular has become the dominate corprate religion
[4:16:13] <Dakuu75> display-bar
[4:16:24] <Seraphile> @illTemperedSeaBass the philosphists are like socialist/anarchists cross morman/LDS religious split off cult

[4:21:00] <mayorrev> It's not a phase mom! I'M AN IDEALIST NOW
[4:21:01] <@lewdskeletor13> Joining the anarchists to own your mom
[4:21:02] <dekkitout> Tucker just wanted to go to Tashi station to get power converters...
[4:21:03] <natscazz> you'll kill her ;)
[4:21:03] <Djinnazz> CONVERT HER!
[4:21:06] <sire_nukerre> ikr 42 and rebelling
[4:21:16] <%torontototoro> yes, convert the 90 year old shut in to the militant cult lolol
[4:21:17] <$RubberFistFight> @sire_nukerre IT'S NOT A PHASE MUM
[4:21:18] <%derap41> 42 and joining a cult
[4:21:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> @RubberFistFight It's everything, right? but that big reveal just nailed it home that that icky feeling I got from him was super justified.
[4:21:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> he is gonna get fucked
[4:21:23] <+theotherkristian> Its not a phaze ma, It's a MIDDLE age crisis!!!
[4:21:24] <%mintyrobo> Watch Tucker go die now

[4:21:36] <Dakuu75> @doc_ock_rokc on multiple levels

[4:21:43] <Zinax7> life is a tragedy

[4:22:01] <+TONYOO101> btw its really recommended you do the sidequests for the msi and the iconoclasts before doing the main quest
[4:22:07] <+rdark_ksu> oh yea
[4:22:16] <+theotherkristian> wat he said
[4:22:17] <%derap41> Pat missed the giver for this quest
[4:22:21] <Seraphile> take drugs boost stats
[4:22:26] <@lewdskeletor13> Yes you should definitely do the faction quests before the main quest
[4:22:28] <+griffball13> parvatii help
[4:22:32] <Zinax7> you basically need to do the side quests to continue the main quest right?
[4:22:48] <ShoggothLord> These people don't seem very anarchist, what with the apparent social hierarchy in which one person runs the community. "No rulers" my ass.
[4:22:54] <+rdark_ksu> parvati can do machines
[4:22:55] <%derap41> @Zinax7 not really
[4:23:00] <@commanderclaw> Can't you get Parvati with you and wear the right gear for it?
[4:23:03] <asurite_warrior> If you find it you can fix
[4:23:06] <Seraphile> @Zinax7 if you don't consider murdering everyone an option, then yes
[4:23:12] <%lotharrio> Or do some druuuuuuugs.
[4:23:13] <%cmdrmobium> Monarch forces you to do the MSI and Iconoclast quests
[4:23:16] <Zinax7> i mean in this case
[4:23:20] <heartlesshealer> this isn't Bethesda, Pat
[4:23:21] <TechDragon_Z> Pat there's a path up
[4:23:32] <Zinax7> in the monarch main quest
[4:23:42] <heartlesshealer> steam is hot!
[4:23:44] <+rdark_ksu> denied by the steam

[4:24:04] <%torontototoro> hmmm. so this game has steam but steam doesnt have this game
[4:24:09] <+ThunderZebraKing> I dunno if turning it off is fixing it
[4:24:18] <%derap41> its not the unique one
[4:24:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> The shotgun people were talking about is called the Euthanasia Kit
[4:24:19] <%nekodelic> @torontototoro timed exclusive for epic
[4:24:24] <%derap41> its just a mark 2
[4:24:24] <asurite_warrior> special ones
[4:24:30] <asurite_warrior> You get it off a medic

[4:24:38] <+blitzrush1200> You'll get it later hard to miss
[4:24:41] <Glass_Muffin> Just beat the game. Ending was interesting
[4:24:52] <@lewdskeletor13> Euthanasia Kit rocks
[4:24:52] <+ThunderZebraKing> Has he found the unique heavy machine gun?
[4:24:55] <asurite_warrior> Did the old fallout thing
[4:25:09] <@commanderclaw> "I stole your food and sold it for five dollars"
[4:25:10] <Zinax7> ending was a bit underwhelming imo
[4:25:18] <Glass_Muffin> i agree @Zinax7

[4:28:42] <%cmdrmobium> gottem
[4:28:43] <Zinax7> 1 hour later
[4:28:45] <%lotharrio> It feels like two people arguing the same thing with a small difference, and one is super salty over the use of, "of" instead of "by" in a definition of a term.
[4:28:45] <%AncelDeLambert> both these ideologies are astroturf as hell and need to die
[4:28:47] <%torontototoro> oooooooh apatDab

[4:29:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> no u
[4:29:11] <sire_nukerre> that no u was subtle tho
[4:29:12] <%AncelDeLambert> this is literally a fight between Deism and Pantheism
[4:29:12] <suikudo> that was the most interesting exchange between 2 non characters about religion ever
[4:29:13] <+griffball13> holy fuck
[4:29:22] <Zinax7> max didnt want to admit that he got a hardon for graham

[4:29:28] <VigilantShield> oh god is it a option to shoot him right now
[4:29:31] <%AncelDeLambert> LITERALLY a fight between Deism and Pantheism
[4:29:35] <AMaidIndeed> @GeneralSCPatton 10 points for you
[4:29:36] <KlorikonWilds> How is that ANY different of the Plan? both have roles to fill
[4:29:38] <Zinax7> your body betrays your degeneracy
[4:29:40] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat wait can you explain the exact opposite?
[4:29:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> determinism vs philosophism
[4:29:46] <%ChaosAethr> @AngriestPat So a Crusade Pat?
[4:29:47] <leinadtonu> I didn't see this interaction with Max. My max was different when I got here.
[4:29:49] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god Max shut up
[4:29:53] <asurite_warrior> Pat Don't shit on peoples attempts to explain the universe.
[4:29:54] <BlacSoul> OOOOHHH
[4:29:55] <%torontototoro> "that's just, like, your opinion man!"
[4:29:57] <%mintyrobo> Believe in the power of placebo!
[4:30:00] <+rdark_ksu> fuck off muttonchops
[4:30:05] <%cmdrmobium> Existentialism vs Deism
[4:30:07] <%AncelDeLambert> this is so college town coffee shop, my god
[4:30:13] <sire_nukerre> max calling him out like that is spicy.
[4:30:17] <+ThunderZebraKing> Everyone in this game is a big dumb idiot
[4:30:17] <Dakuu75> wake me up inside
[4:30:19] <%Taglog7> LUL
[4:30:26] <%Taglog7> You like apples?
[4:30:27] <Zinax7> oh you'll feel cold death
[4:30:28] <%SGrim> If he says the word communism, I'm out.
[4:30:31] <%torontototoro> you won't even need to kill Graham. He'll suffocate sniffing his own farts
[4:30:40] <+griffball13> SANJAR IS A SAINT
[4:30:40] <Seraphile> dont shit talk sanjar
[4:30:44] <Frostydough1> I can FEEL the chakras coming off this guy
[4:30:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah, these two have beef
[4:30:45] <CrypticMochi> I need a squad with MIRVs
[4:30:48] <%AncelDeLambert> OH SNAP HE DISSIN OUR BOI SANJAR!
[4:30:49] <+rdark_ksu> they prob dont talk much anymore
[4:30:50] <Frostydough1> some needs to vibe check this man
[4:30:50] <Dakuu75> wow...
[4:30:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> college town coffee shop rejects
[4:30:54] <+ThunderZebraKing> Sanjar is actually a good boss, he gives them like, actual lives instead of just being slaves
[4:30:55] <%miguelrod777> ID SUCK SANJARS DICK
[4:30:56] <Seraphile> sanjar cares more for his people than you ever have
[4:30:58] <%derap41> Maybe they just built Sanjar up to knock him down for you
[4:31:00] <MasterDecoder> Nice Pat
[4:31:02] <sire_nukerre> I really am a fan of sanjar
[4:31:04] <%linSP> yo this is THAT guy
[4:31:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> graham believes the plan is interperative, Max believes its to be taken exactly
[4:31:06] <%AncelDeLambert> everyone in here is wearing a barret
[4:31:10] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> teeth grinding repulsion
[4:31:10] <%derap41> Maybe he is a total bastard and tricked you
[4:31:13] <+griffball13> this is just order vs chaos
[4:31:18] <leinadtonu> fuck this guy... and this isn't even the worst of him.
[4:31:23] <%MightyMaxT> Have you ever met someone who talked like that?
[4:31:26] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat this guy just doesn't want to work. He wants his cult to pay him for jerking off into the void.
[4:31:30] <%AncelDeLambert> shut UP Max
[4:31:30] <%torontototoro> you tell im Maxy!
[4:31:33] <%CopperTucker> this guy has made me vomit all over the place
[4:31:34] <%ChaosAethr> So Chaos Reign All?
[4:31:36] <Dakuu75> the Big Bang is my god
[4:31:36] <%derap41> Theory of everything and all htat
[4:31:38] <+ThunderZebraKing> I wonder if he has a voice line that says "the mind is just chemical reactions" B)
[4:31:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> I've had this conversation before
[4:31:43] <VigilantShield> ugh i hate them all just wanna get the game and end them all right now
[4:31:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> @griffball13 It's interpretation vs literalism.
[4:31:44] <%AncelDeLambert> oh fuck Graham is right about something my god
[4:31:45] <Seraphile> max is just as wrong but i hate him less
[4:31:47] <sire_nukerre> 2 religious people arguiing
[4:31:48] <%honeyman18> Punch him in the DICK
[4:31:51] <eanscrale> That's a BIG leap
[4:31:54] <+TechnicolorNinja> "It just works"
[4:31:54] <BlacSoul> Theyre both insufferable
[4:31:59] <sire_nukerre> this is pretty accurate
[4:32:00] <Djinnazz> i mean, I KINDA get it.
[4:32:01] <%lotharrio> Philosophism, "Science but it's religion though." Scientism, "Religion but it's science though."
[4:32:02] <+RowenCleric> twist his dick!
[4:32:03] <$arcielardor> this is straight-up East versus West thought
[4:32:03] <asurite_warrior> Be honest how many times did you say Burn it all fucking down during emerald vale?
[4:32:04] <%AncelDeLambert> they ARE both insufferable
[4:32:05] <Dakuu75> Iconaclast was a good game, ya'll should look it up on Steam
[4:32:07] <$RubberFistFight> WE DO NOT KNEEL
[4:32:11] <%derap41> Which is why they all follow you
[4:32:12] <%Daniel_Is_I> This guy is just Work Is Slavery: The Character
[4:32:22] <MasterDecoder> -handjob motions-
[4:32:24] <%AncelDeLambert> @asurite_warrior just the once, but it was after I read that everyone had scurvy
[4:32:25] <Monkeyweed21> free to starve
[4:32:26] <dekkitout> Hey! We live in one of those...
[4:32:27] <%cmdrmobium> BREAK THE CHAINS
[4:32:31] <%ChaosAethr> So Space JW
[4:32:35] <sire_nukerre> it does, actually
[4:32:38] <$RubberFistFight> WaKE uP sHeEpLE
[4:32:50] <%AncelDeLambert> Yeah, I hate Graham more too
[4:32:52] <sire_nukerre> same, pat
[4:32:54] <%derap41> Hippie shit is annoying
[4:32:59] <Frostydough1> look at this boomer hating hippies
[4:32:59] <%lotharrio> Pat really just wants someone to laugh at his dick. That's all he needs in a religion.
[4:32:59] <%cmdrmobium> @AngriestPat you sided with the hippies on Edgewater tho
[4:33:00] <%bread_assassin> Join the Board just to spite him.
[4:33:02] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> test shotgun
[4:33:02] <%Taglog7> NORMIES MAN
[4:33:03] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> It's like they found my off-switch
[4:33:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat is that because of aliens pat?
[4:33:06] <s_snowball> sounds like you're part of the problem, maaaaan CiGrip
[4:33:07] <+rdark_ksu> ah that spite for hippies feeling
[4:33:10] <Seraphile> cant feed people with just ideals
[4:33:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> this is how Pat started playing this game.
[4:33:15] <%torontototoro> the funny thing is the game somehow manages to get you to hate Graham MORE later. amazing stuff
[4:33:15] <osiris1260> TEST SHOTGUN
[4:33:16] <sire_nukerre> lmao he did side withh the hippies in edgewater
[4:33:16] <%cylish> Cant they both be asshats?
[4:33:21] <tusk102> @AngriestPat At least Max KNOWS he's an asshole
[4:33:22] <+ThunderZebraKing> Quasi atheistic bandit hippies
[4:33:23] <CrypticMochi> Orange chops wants a rim job while he jerks off into the void
[4:33:24] <Monkeyweed21> you seem to be dying like a bitch
[4:33:36] <Dakuu75> knowing the system exists and that you're apart of it... doesn't mean you can do anything about it.
[4:34:03] <Seraphile> @AngriestPat its gets super cartoonish again on byzantium
[4:34:04] <ShoggothLord> Okay, Obsidian just doesn't know what anarchism is. Shit.
[4:34:04] <+blitzrush1200> How about you print some pamphlets
[4:34:07] <%torontototoro> print media! hooray
[4:34:10] <Djinnazz> fuck this guy
[4:34:10] <sire_nukerre> lmao
[4:34:11] <%derap41> Zora keeping it real
[4:34:11] <+ThunderZebraKing> Well the board hasnt been here in a long time
[4:34:11] <asurite_warrior> One is we are parts of a machine and the other is we are all part of god
[4:34:13] <ShoggothLord> There's my hope dead.
[4:34:13] <%GarbageNirvana> Zora just straight up "Yes"
[4:34:14] <%lotharrio> Remember in Edgewater, when Reed showed he was human and flawed and full of regret for how he let things get so bad? You left and told the guy he'd be eaten.
[4:34:15] <+griffball13> WORDS OVER FOOD
[4:34:17] <%Tucker0603> FUCK THIS GUY
[4:34:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> do the printing press quest
[4:34:21] <%honeyman18> FEEL HER PAIN PAT
[4:34:22] <sire_nukerre> 1 word answer, good old zora
[4:34:23] <+arancet> why eat food when we can eat our words
[4:34:24] <%linSP> FUCK food, PAMPHLETS MAN
[4:34:26] <tusk102> "sir we're dying" "no no it's fine tho just keep spreading the word"
[4:34:27] <VigilantShield> let's not feed everyone let's just spread our beliefs more what could go wrong
[4:34:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> you get big good shotty
[4:34:31] <pmtriox> immediate priorities out of wack
[4:34:32] <asurite_warrior> They are definatly formed from the same original line.
[4:34:34] <twan22> Way to much talking in this game.
[4:34:34] <42nfl19> OH GOD YOU ARE RIGHT, HE IS A MILITANT AND HIPPY BULTIST
[4:34:35] <Dakuu75> this dude has some half-assed wolverine mutton-chops. no buenus
[4:34:37] <+blitzrush1200> Get those rollers, they are critical
[4:34:37] <@lewdskeletor13> @shoggothlord Yes they do. He just said they aren’t anarchists
[4:34:39] <%torontototoro> Distribute the food, eat the pamphlets!
[4:34:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Zora is very practical
[4:34:55] <%GarbageNirvana> Zora is extremely tired
[4:34:55] <%ChaosAethr> @AngriestPat Pat I think his Brain Needs an introduction to a Shell
[4:34:58] <%nekodelic> Zora should rule Halcyon
[4:35:01] <%Tucker0603> Zora is a.good girl
[4:35:03] <pmtriox> I smell a side quest where you out the party leader and insert scars in his place
[4:35:05] <+MisterRockett> Wait when? Who's Huxly?
[4:35:05] <%derap41> fucking hypocrites too
[4:35:07] <Seraphile> Zora is the one sane woman
[4:35:07] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[4:35:15] <tusk102> OH MY GOD he's literally the board with the "work will fortify the body" but it's "spreading the word will fortify the body"
[4:35:15] <%miguelrod777> fuck him
[4:35:17] <%AncelDeLambert> poor Zora. Especially given some logs I just read, poor fucking Zora
[4:35:27] <%AncelDeLambert> look at this shit she's putting up with
[4:35:28] <%derap41> Man these shits really are hippies
[4:35:33] <%nekodelic> @misterrockett Huxley is the girl that was trapped in the door
[4:35:35] <Seraphile> Zora deserves better
[4:35:36] <%torontototoro> Monarch should be Zora's Domain!
[4:35:36] <Dakuu75> @AngriestPat these seem like, they might be your most disliked NPC so far, eh?
[4:35:38] <BlacSoul> What the FUCK is wrong with Graham
[4:35:47] <sire_nukerre> the irony in this
[4:35:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is a complete counterculture
[4:35:56] <sire_nukerre> sanjar who looks corprate fuck, isn't
[4:35:58] <AncelDeLambert> @BlacSoul Savior's Complex
[4:36:00] <asurite_warrior> This game often follows the idea that being a moderate is the best answer.
[4:36:03] <+griffball13> MORE ADS
[4:36:05] <ShoggothLord> @lewdskeletor13 Sorry, I'm getting sleepy, mistyped. What I meant to say is that I likely won't be getting a proper anarchist group to side with.
[4:36:10] <+ThunderZebraKing> He's bacisally the polar opposite of the board . Two extremes of the same spectrum
[4:36:14] <osiris1260> MAYBE don't do this quest yet?
[4:36:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> @BlacSoul Moral Relativism, just like everyone else.
[4:36:20] <@commanderclaw> "Sacrifice food for more ad space"
[4:36:24] <Seraphile> always help zora
[4:36:26] <VigilantShield> can we kill him and put her in charge she seems the most sensible of the bunch
[4:36:27] <BlacSoul> @AncelDeLambert i hate him so much
[4:36:28] <%ChaosAethr> Yeah this guy needs a hole in his head
[4:36:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> Do it now. You get big good gun.
[4:36:32] <%cmdrmobium> Obsidian supports horseshoe theory?
[4:36:34] <CrypticMochi> Time to jump on Zora’s Blackwood
[4:36:37] <sire_nukerre> this post sponsored by thhe Spacer's Choice!
[4:36:39] <tusk102> "sir we're running out of food" "no no it's fine tho"
[4:36:43] <%lotharrio> Also, not medbay or the hospital or clinic. It's triage. They don't expect anyone to live.
[4:36:43] <+arancet> fucking SPAAAACE HIPPIES
[4:36:43] <%Parapattern> Pat, you might want to hold off on taking sides until you see what the Board is up to in [Redacted].
[4:36:45] <Dakuu75> @commanderclaw sacrifice your children for more time ont he clock, lmao
[4:36:49] <osiris1260> Its really important you pick a side before you do that quest
[4:36:50] <%derap41> this is where you get the shotty
[4:36:51] <pmtriox> someone's about be demoted from the poliburo real hard
[4:36:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ThunderZebraKing yet both are uncaring about the needs of the people. Its amazing how two extremes are so similar
[4:36:56] <sire_nukerre> It's not the best choice, it's Spacer's Choice!
[4:36:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> Graham is the sludge.
[4:37:00] <%nekodelic> the Iconoclasts are great people, Graham is the stupid piece of shit
[4:37:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[4:37:10] <%Daniel_Is_I> Graham: "THE BOARD IS KILLING US!" Also Graham: "Who needs food? Eat these words!"
[4:37:14] <%derap41> no wait my mistake
[4:37:16] <@lewdskeletor13> I love the Iconoclasts, just not Graham
[4:37:16] <sire_nukerre> ye im glad we identified the idiot
[4:37:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> And you evven have the badge!
[4:37:22] <Seraphile> everyone ive talked to about this game has been "fuck graham"
[4:37:30] <asurite_warrior> Pat the best option is not to be a pawn in anyones game and take hold
[4:37:32] <%AncelDeLambert> the Iconoclasts are outcasts of the predominant culture in the system, they're fine. But Graham is an abuser with aspirations to sainthood, fuck him.
[4:37:35] <Dakuu75> pull the stick outa your ass, friend.
[4:37:38] <%derap41> ew
[4:37:45] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Do the main quest, you're locking yourself off from options if you keep doing side quests
[4:37:49] <Djinnazz> If not kill him, put him in a position TO be killed.
[4:37:51] <BlacSoul> @rumtumtugnutz I can deal with relativism, not self agrandizing
[4:37:53] <%Saltmeisterr> oh pat still strimming
[4:37:55] <asurite_warrior> Abuser?
[4:37:57] <$RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc and just think, both of them would stand there shrieking "fUcKInG cEnTRiST mOdEraTEs" if they met someone who rejected both sides. Funny how well this game reflects reality, isn't it.
[4:37:58] <pmtriox> big fucking guns
[4:38:13] <VigilantShield> what a bright lad he is
[4:38:16] <%lotharrio> Pack it up, pack it in.
[4:38:17] <pmtriox> or that
[4:38:20] <sire_nukerre> THAT SHRUG
[4:38:20] <+BurkeBigsby> Huh. thought you would've beaten this by now. Game's not that expansive....or good.
[4:38:22] <%torontototoro> Surprised Pat hasn't done any Sublight quests yet
[4:38:24] <+rdark_ksu> hey man i aint risking getting vored by insects
[4:38:30] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s not surprising that Graham became a cult leader given his corporate review said he was a great at marketing and slogans. Good at manipulation
[4:38:31] <Seraphile> they avoided being murdered by you
[4:38:31] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Moongang is just a roving nightmare
[4:38:33] <Seraphile> thats smart
[4:38:36] <%honeyman18> Moon Gang haunts my dreams
[4:38:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RubberFistFight or "Milktoast fence sitters"
[4:38:39] <%Saltmeisterr> MOON GANG
[4:38:45] <sire_nukerre> you can totally murder and massacrre them
[4:38:51] <Seraphile> @AngriestPat save
[4:38:52] <tusk102> does the moon gang believe in "Gravity"
[4:38:56] <%hazzy_o7> oh no
[4:38:57] <$RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc actually it's spelled "milquetoaste" for some fucking reason. No idea why.
[4:38:58] <sire_nukerre> oh no
[4:38:59] <%CrabSlacks> everyone trusts the moon gang
[4:39:00] <%derap41> oops
[4:39:01] <+blitzrush1200> oh no
[4:39:02] <sire_nukerre> this is that
[4:39:05] <Djinnazz> oh, other option to get them out.
[4:39:09] <VigilantShield> well then
[4:39:09] <Djinnazz> hehe

[4:39:52] <%nekodelic> @rubberfistfight tbf centrism is 90% bs
[4:39:52] <MattDemers> I had the same issue with this specific part; you don't know what you're doing, and if you get the people out beforehand the venting doesn't make any sense.
[4:39:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> oops
[4:39:55] <Monkeyweed21> they ran away
[4:39:55] <suikudo> holy shit did you just pull a gas chamber but with sulfer?

[4:40:05] <Djinnazz> little further.
[4:40:06] <%cmdrmobium> look at the objective marker
[4:40:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> they disintegrated
[4:40:14] <pmtriox> intercom dude
[4:40:14] <%derap41> Yeah that game assumes you'll kill them
[4:40:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> you killed everyone
[4:40:16] <$zackalan> the button next to the door
[4:40:18] <%lotharrio> Looks like your own people yelled?
[4:40:18] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Go tell Graham they were a no sho
[4:40:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> intercom
[4:40:19] <%kewlmyc> GHOSTS
[4:40:20] <@commanderclaw> They disintegrated cause acid
[4:40:31] <Djinnazz> 2!
[4:40:35] <sire_nukerre> omg lol
[4:40:37] <TheApeGatsby> Sublight are jerks anyway lul
[4:40:37] <asurite_warrior> um I thought they died?
[4:40:38] <suikudo> holy hell
[4:40:39] <Djinnazz> 2! do it!
[4:40:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[4:40:43] <%hazzy_o7> It was fine, it was your party that yelled
[4:40:45] <$RubberFistFight> @nekodelic not really, since calling it BS implies that you can only ever have views ascribing to one extreme or another. But that's not a conversation I want to have here.
[4:40:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> YOu can do a Johova's witnesses joke
[4:40:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> why?
[4:40:47] <+griffball13> awww pat is too kind
[4:40:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> Oh my god
[4:40:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> such a kind soul
[4:40:55] <%lotharrio> Better than NAAA-ture!
[4:40:55] <%LewLewLew> LewLewLew subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! m6kwHeart
[4:40:58] <%derap41> they're criminal scum
[4:41:00] <pmtriox> leaky generator leaks everywhere but the generator
[4:41:02] <asurite_warrior> oh no that was for killing the goons
[4:41:02] <suikudo> is it to late?
[4:41:03] <sire_nukerre> ye pat, don't randomly vent gasses outside next time
[4:41:06] <Djinnazz> 2
[4:41:16] <%torontototoro> @derap41 they're saviors of humanity from aliens!
[4:41:24] <based_versauen> they left before you hit the gas. You disintegrated nobody. Just triggered a sound cue by turning it on.
[4:41:29] <%cmdrmobium> The problem is assuming that if there's two extremes, the best solution must be in the middle
[4:41:34] <%cmdrmobium> Sometimes it is, often it isn't
[4:41:42] <%AncelDeLambert> "The Hammer of Olympus"... okay, thanks, game.
[4:41:44] <%derap41> @torontototoro shit I forgot about that shit
[4:41:55] <%derap41> she shiny
[4:42:00] <@lewdskeletor13> She cute
[4:42:05] <%torontototoro> @derap41 they also give you the second best armour in the game imo
[4:42:08] <%Taglog7> hey look short hair
[4:42:13] <%AncelDeLambert> Woolie bait
[4:42:29] <%Saltmeisterr> she orange
[4:42:38] <%Taglog7> representation
[4:42:40] <%honeyman18> She look like a glazed Yam.
[4:42:44] <%AncelDeLambert> *gasp* She's a Naruto!
[4:42:45] <illTemperedSeaBass> @cmdrmobium the counter to that is radical centrism. Moderatism isn't always the answer, but neither is rigid partisanship.
[4:42:48] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> surprise
[4:42:48] <%Taglog7> for us orange folk
[4:42:55] <%AncelDeLambert> we stan Zora in this hizzy
[4:43:02] <+ThunderZebraKing> carlotta pretty hotta
[4:43:08] <Seraphile> Zora deserves better
[4:43:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> I forgot about the helmets and that scared me
[4:43:37] <%GarbageNirvana> I do wish more of these moral choices weren't just "sensible vs. crazy"
[4:43:47] <%nekodelic> @rubberfistfight it's more like there is more than three points in the spectrum, and being in the North American idea of centrism is to put a blind eye on the extremes, which usually favors the right wing due to the fact that every progressive change is, in a way, risky in the establishment perspective
[4:43:49] <Zinax7> why does all the women here have short hairs?
[4:43:49] <%GarbageNirvana> But what can you do
[4:43:58] <McCune> Almost every woman has short hair kinda a similar thing in the fallout games, engine can’t do long hair
[4:44:00] <Zinax7> most of them anyways
[4:44:06] <%AncelDeLambert> My friends, no politics in chat
[4:44:07] <Zinax7> oh
[4:44:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Zinax7 so that monsters can't grab the hair
[4:44:11] <sire_nukerre> they're not
[4:44:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> eeh
[4:44:19] <Zinax7> like superheros with capes?
[4:44:29] <%cmdrmobium> There is long hair you can pick for the player character. The short hair is a stylistic choice
[4:45:13] <%AncelDeLambert> "subversion"?
[4:45:13] <+ThunderZebraKing> Subversion B)
[4:45:15] <%torontototoro> more pamphlets!
[4:45:17] <tusk102> "we just lost half our food supply. let's spread the religion more"
[4:45:20] <%lotharrio> Its not subversion. He doesn't work with you.
[4:45:22] <%AncelDeLambert> He tasks me, he tasks me!
[4:45:28] <Zinax7> i wish i could see a blond chick in the ow expansion
[4:45:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> calm down bitches
[4:45:33] <+blitzrush1200> But Pamphlets
[4:45:36] <%AncelDeLambert> Round the moons of Antari I'll chase him
[4:45:48] <mayorrev> THESE PEOPLE ARE DEAD GRAHAM
[4:45:50] <%Tucker0603> SHOTGUN GRAHAM
[4:45:52] <BlacSoul> Thats a lie
[4:45:59] <%torontototoro> apatWrong
[4:46:00] <%AncelDeLambert> feck, I gotta watch Wrath of Khan again now
[4:46:02] <Paperware> Sacrifice bodies for more pamphlets
[4:46:08] <%honeyman18> Snap that bitch like a Cracker.
[4:46:08] <Seraphile> graham doesn't give a shit about his people
[4:46:09] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Just let Graham run this into the ground, I am sure they are going to eat him for it before the end
[4:46:10] <%derap41> Truth Zora
[4:46:19] <%torontototoro> pamphlets> people because pamplets = more people?
[4:46:25] <CrypticMochi> They are our faithful red shirts
[4:46:25] <%kewlmyc> Zora seems she has to put with a lot of stupid shit
[4:46:27] <Zinax7> zora be my mama
[4:46:39] <%derap41> so you want hippie commune or militant milita
[4:46:46] <illTemperedSeaBass> There was a thing that said Graham was really good at manipulation? He definitely seems like the kinda guy who fell hook line and sinker for his own shit.
[4:46:46] <@lewdskeletor13> We stan Zora
[4:46:48] <tusk102> Graham is clearly a dipshit who knows how to say words good and literally not much else
[4:46:48] <Seraphile> yeah i know right :^)
[4:46:49] <misterspotswood> can you talk to her in her room so to plot to get this dude out?
[4:46:54] <%AncelDeLambert> I mean, they're militant either way
[4:46:58] <osiris1260> BE VERY CAREFULL, YOURE PICKING A SIDE
[4:47:03] <%honeyman18> save them
[4:47:03] <Djinnazz> So tossball = Lecross?
[4:47:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> Spacers chosen is a good team name
[4:47:11] <misterspotswood> that armor is coooool
[4:47:14] <@lewdskeletor13> @osiris1260 No he isn’t
[4:47:16] <%GarbageNirvana> @osiris1260 Eh, not really
[4:47:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> cool
[4:47:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> tossball is lacross
[4:47:34] <Seraphile> @AngriestPat this is where you get shotgun
[4:47:34] <%torontototoro> yeah send them home
[4:47:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Zora's thinking about you, xoxoxoxo
[4:47:46] <BlacSoul> HOME
[4:47:47] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 3
[4:47:49] <%honeyman18> Zora is the best choice
[4:48:07] <%torontototoro> I wonder if having Ellie here would let you skip this
[4:48:09] <%CrabSlacks> how did there people stay alive so long with grahams leadership skill
[4:48:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> he ded
[4:48:21] <%AncelDeLambert> you guys like raptidons? Course you love raptidons, why'd I ask
[4:48:24] <%nekodelic> @torontototoro unfortunately not
[4:48:25] <Seraphile> @torontototoro I had ellie, no skip
[4:48:27] <+LiveStreamOnyx> @crabslacks good question
[4:48:30] <%AncelDeLambert> RAPTIDONS FOR EVERYONE!
[4:48:36] <Futurecity10> only 10 more rathalos scales T_T
[4:48:42] <%torontototoro> darn. I love when companions let you skip stuff. Like Nyoka and the rapts
[4:48:42] <%honeyman18> Right Turn
[4:49:04] <%derap41> @Futurecity10 you mean for the outfit?
[4:49:16] <%AncelDeLambert> it Big Bertha
[4:49:19] <dekkitout> Why was everything green for a sec
[4:49:21] <Djinnazz> got any grenades?
[4:49:22] <Seraphile> save maybe
[4:49:45] <%GarbageNirvana> Alright give him the stick DON'T GIVE HIM THE STICK
[4:49:58] <misterspotswood> they have shotguns in prison?
[4:49:59] <sire_nukerre> that's some brutal prison trick
[4:50:00] <Futurecity10> @derap41 mount
[4:50:02] <MattDemers> "Here's a little trick I learned in prison! It's called... shoot them with a gun!"
[4:50:17] <%MightyMaxT> `What team is everyone rocking? I have Ellie/Pavarti; tired cynic and naive optimist
[4:50:17] <@Moobot> Hey, if you guys feel like checking out The Outer Worlds on account of this stream or cause you think I'm cool, go ahead and use this link https://bit.ly/2JmpB3Q to grab it off Greenman Gaming, and I'll get a few bucks kicked back. Thanks!
[4:50:19] <%juxtest> He didn't even find the printing press
[4:50:20] <%derap41> Bonus headshot damage it doesn't say on thje stats
[4:50:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I call this move "PRISON TRICK"
[4:50:35] <%honeyman18> HEADSHOTS
[4:50:35] <%GarbageNirvana> Pretty tight spread on that shotgun
[4:50:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> Thats a good name for a shotgun
[4:50:47] <sire_nukerre> get euthanised
[4:50:49] <%nekodelic> fun thing is that if you use the science hammer, you would probably one-shot all of them at this point in the game LUL
[4:50:50] <illTemperedSeaBass> "Here's a little trick I learned in prison!" *camera cuts to creature flinching in pain as something hits it in the ass*
[4:50:55] <@lewdskeletor13> I used that shotgun for awhile
[4:51:00] <%derap41> science hammer is no fun
[4:51:13] <sire_nukerre> I just nade everything
[4:51:14] <%Kiiper> that was a really bored "oh, fuck."
[4:51:16] <%GarbageNirvana> I found a lot of the science weapons to be underwhelming honestly
[4:51:40] <%lotharrio> It seems you have to hyper specialize for science weapons.
[4:51:45] <%torontototoro> none of the science weapons were that fun imo. too gimmicky and don't scale well
[4:51:53] <osiris1260> Science Hammer is OP, so its a little repetitive
[4:51:55] <Zinax7> i want a crew hangout event
[4:51:59] <%derap41> Strong alcohol gives you the shits.
[4:52:00] <Seraphile> blob gun is fun
[4:52:00] <@lewdskeletor13> Science Weapons and flaws are both good ideas that I hope the eventual sequel will make better
[4:52:00] <Zinax7> too bad there is none
[4:52:04] <%honeyman18> It's a looping list.
[4:52:04] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Big poops happen every day Pat... for most people
[4:52:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> haa
[4:52:04] <sire_nukerre> the baton on companion is not bad
[4:52:05] <%Taglog7> Max taking a max dump again
[4:52:05] <+rdark_ksu> weak wobbly bitch ankles
[4:52:06] <+blitzrush1200> Yeah they loop, only one interaction with each crew pairing
[4:52:10] <tusk102> Patron "Glass Ankles" Hawthorne
[4:52:14] <%nekodelic> the only good one is the hammer imo (for now)
[4:52:24] <TheApeGatsby> @torontototoro The Mind Control gun is absolutely broken, especially on humans with guns
[4:52:32] <misterspotswood> a JO in a shared bathroom shouldnt take more than 10 minutes, its common courtesy
[4:52:39] <Seraphile> @blitzrush1200 felix+ellie has multiple, vicar+ellie has multiple
[4:52:40] <%torontototoro> I wish there were more fun gimmick weapons to use if you don't spec into science
[4:52:42] <Zinax7> guys have pat played divinity original sin 2?
[4:52:50] <@lewdskeletor13> Yes
[4:52:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> a bit
[4:53:06] <Seraphile> Nyoka+SAM
[4:53:09] <+claudesavegely> sound about right
[4:53:09] <asurite_warrior> oh no 1 bullet
[4:53:10] <Zinax7> with woolie?
[4:53:12] <%GarbageNirvana> He hasn't done a full stream of it but mostly because folks tend to wander away when he plays CRPGs like that
[4:53:16] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Bad trigger dicipline
[4:53:24] <+claudesavegely> that super beast game sure was rad
[4:53:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nah
[4:53:29] <%Kiiper> It was him and Paige right?
[4:53:32] <KaiserMario> !uptime
[4:53:32] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 53m.
[4:53:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yea
[4:53:49] <Balsty> hey pat what do you think of diablo 4?
[4:54:00] <@lewdskeletor13> cryShrug
[4:54:04] <%nekodelic> pat has the trigger discipline of a 15 year old gangster in a shitty Hollywood movie
[4:54:07] <tusk102> what's the moongang's slogan. is it "we do it" or is it "moon gang x48"
[4:54:11] <misterspotswood> is the meat useful?
[4:54:15] <KaiserMario> I just realized Pat is in kinda of a sexy pose, showing off his T&A
[4:54:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> JESUS
[4:54:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> Knockback is fuuuuun
[4:54:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> The headshot damage is nearly double!
[4:54:39] <Djinnazz> LVL UP!
[4:54:42] <Gustave_XIII> Gratz
[4:54:44] <@lewdskeletor13> Euthanize them all
[4:54:48] <+claudesavegely> 100 persuade
[4:54:49] <%DraxTD> wow pat is STILL going eh
[4:54:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 100!!!!!!!!! YEYYE
[4:55:00] <%honeyman18> it's a sound medical practice!
[4:55:13] <%torontototoro> has pat been taking flaws or ignoring them?
[4:55:15] <sire_nukerre> they cute
[4:55:23] <%foreverN2dust> 100 science and 100 persuade, the perfect OSI evangelical.
[4:55:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> law have mercy
[4:55:28] <+MisterRockett> God these guys are so much more of a problem on Hard.
[4:55:44] <lordsdb> I was just about to ask if there is a hard mode
[4:55:56] <+MisterRockett> Oh there's an Ultra Hard.
[4:56:00] <@lewdskeletor13> I still have to do my Supernova playthrough
[4:56:06] <%foreverN2dust> but sunk cost though
[4:56:08] <%honeyman18> The knockout bar freaks me out cause there is no indication is a freaky Science Tumor Food.
[4:56:13] <lordsdb> Oh sweet Ultra hard it is then
[4:56:13] <$pyrotherian> Honestly? Upgrading weapons aren't really worth it more often than not.
[4:56:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> heavy guns have more range too
[4:56:21] <$pyrotherian> Outside of SCIENCE ones
[4:56:28] <+ThunderZebraKing> I hope he explores this region a bit more
[4:56:37] <%nekodelic> supernova is literally unbalanced hell
[4:56:42] <KaiserMario> He only has the one flaw, right?
[4:56:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> canadian aboots are stupid
[4:57:01] <$pyrotherian> God, Flaws are such a hindrance.
[4:57:06] <%GarbageNirvana> Why would you wanna fuck a boot
[4:57:18] <dekkitout> Why would you not?
[4:57:22] <%nekodelic> some flaws are worth it
[4:57:28] <Djinnazz> Diet toothpaste?
[4:57:52] <$pyrotherian> It's toothpaste, but diet.
[4:57:55] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Kill Max
[4:57:58] <JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> moon gang
[4:58:04] <%AncelDeLambert> STOP PUTTING WILL TO HAPPENSTANCE
[4:58:10] <sire_nukerre> death standing
[4:58:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> max is right
[4:58:20] <%torontototoro> I wish the diet toothpaste figured in more to the endgame (seriously, it could make sense)
[4:58:34] <Seraphile> it does figure into end game
[4:58:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wait wtf zara???
[4:58:45] <%honeyman18> Keep with ZORA, it pays off.
[4:58:52] <%torontototoro> really? i didn't see anything about it or auntie cleo in the epilogue
[4:59:02] <%lotharrio> Shoot pamphlets out into space!
[4:59:10] <VigilantShield> god i hate him
[4:59:11] <dekkitout> Not just the men...
[4:59:13] <lordsdb> Okay I can really understand why Pat doesn't like this guy
[4:59:18] <Seraphile> the epilogues are underweight compared to other obsidian games
[4:59:23] <%torontototoro> coup! coup! coup!
[4:59:32] <mr_ESB> This voice is chris redfield?
[4:59:39] <Djinnazz> COOOOL
[4:59:42] <Seraphile> @torontototoro akande will talk about it
[4:59:42] <Monkeyweed21> give it to nyoka
[4:59:43] <@lewdskeletor13> Yes it’s Roger Craig Smith
[4:59:44] <%honeyman18> She literally has to walk back to her clinic to start her quest.
[4:59:48] <%Tucker0603> SEXY ARMOR
[4:59:52] <jamesofn> @AngriestPat that iconoclast armor is important for a quest later, dont sell it
[4:59:53] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> moon mang
[4:59:53] <mr_ESB> Ah alright
[4:59:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YOO
[4:59:57] <@commanderclaw> Best armor in the game for a melee build
[4:59:58] <%torontototoro> I forced Max to wear that armor, since he hates everything that faction stands for
[5:00:05] <+blitzrush1200> Pairs well with prismatic hammer build

[5:00:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @torontototoro I like you
[5:00:23] <%torontototoro> @Seraphile good to know! will make sure to keep an eye out if I get around to a corporate playthrough
[5:00:23] <osiris1260> Pat, did you forget to tinker your armor?

[5:00:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> rebel butt
[5:01:04] <undercoverbarber> And let me play among the stars
[5:01:11] <%torontototoro> let's see if Pat's prophesizing works again
[5:01:18] <%nekodelic> !exposition
[5:01:59] <Hanyusha> Why do we care about pirates who killed a bunch of CEO's?
[5:02:07] <braaklyn> So what’s the deal with the planets that have their names greyed out in the navigation menu?
[5:02:14] <illTemperedSeaBass> Is Pat's prophesizing ability part of his stand?
[5:02:23] <%lotharrio> Because they also killed the CEO's families, and the result was the companies pulling out of Monarch, which lead to a lot of deaths.

[5:02:46] <braaklyn> Just beat the game by the way. Didn’t realize I was about 25 hours in
[5:02:48] <sire_nukerre> pat's crazy talk requiem ability is at work here
[5:02:48] <Seraphile> honestly when i did this quest i was so terrified that the traitor was gonna turn out to be sanjar
[5:02:49] <Hanyusha> @illTemperedSeaBass his ability is to be wrong regardless of how right he sounds.
[5:02:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> food = good
[5:02:57] <%lotharrio> Mantisaurs resist plasma damage, Pat. Have fun.
[5:02:59] <sire_nukerre> it's doing its job and pat don't even know
[5:03:10] <Djinnazz> Plz be Graham
[5:03:15] <ireliaismaiwaifu> i think he knows
[5:03:17] <%torontototoro> @DesuDesuDokiDoki how can you say something so controversial, yet so brave?
[5:03:21] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> If there is an option, lie and say it was Graham
[5:03:22] <jamesofn> i bet it would be great-ham
[5:03:24] <42nfl19> @angriestpat wait the pirates snuck in to town? I wonder who would be willing to give ANYONE a code.

[5:04:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> @illTemperedSeaBass Crazy talk has two forms Normal and requiem Normal makes anything he predicts wrong. Requiem, makes people reject the truth that he accurately predicted
[5:04:33] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> I do like one touch obliteration

[5:09:01] <%torontototoro> Paige, specifically
[5:09:05] <dekkitout> Phrasing
[5:09:06] <KaiserMario> An EYEPATCH that increases sneak damage??? Is that a MGS refference???

[5:09:44] <Wall1ce> this game is a lot like vampyre the masquerade, it's somewhat short and sweet but the replayability is about making human choices that affect the colony
[5:10:20] <KaiserMario> Colony? Like the Nosferatu?
[5:10:29] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> It is after 1, I think I am going to head to bed soon, does anyone know if this will wrap up shortly? Like are we getting to a stop point in the quest?
[5:10:45] <KaiserMario> !uptime
[5:10:46] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 10m.

[5:11:24] <Hanyusha> What did you find on the old datapad? Is there a notes section?
[5:11:39] <%nekodelic> vampire's hacking is a little more relevant to the gameplay than in this game, and with more focus given to unique areas rather than the overworld, otherwise it's the closest Bloodlines fans will get until the sequel
[5:11:46] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Thanks @KaiserMario I will have to catch up in the VODs
[5:12:11] <ireliaismaiwaifu> oh no, it was graham? what a twist!
[5:12:14] <jamesofn> D: what a shock
[5:12:15] <Djinnazz> Kill him'
[5:12:15] <%Daniel_Is_I> WHO COULD HAVE KNOWN
[5:12:22] <+rdark_ksu> yea this was not terribly subtle to me
[5:12:23] <%honeyman18> WHAT A TWIST!
[5:12:35] <Seraphile> i was so glad it wasnt sanjar
[5:12:39] <Seraphile> or cassandra
[5:12:48] <42nfl19> Wait it wasn't the gate dude who just gave @AngriestPat the gate code freely?
[5:12:48] <Hanyusha> I think he's a Guilty Gear fan, LIVE AND LET DIE
[5:12:54] <+TONYOO101> hey pat, you really want to consider doing the sublight mission before starting the main quest
[5:12:54] <42nfl19> I thought that would of been the twist
[5:12:56] <jamesofn> yeah it comes back later
[5:12:59] <asurite_warrior> Talk to grahm
[5:13:00] <@lewdskeletor13> @angriestpat you have to do the main quest before you can do the coup
[5:13:02] <+xBolts4Lifex> THAT IS BULLSHIT CRAZY
[5:13:03] <%GarbageNirvana> Wonder what'd happen if you did
[5:13:03] <VigilantShield> i mean you could shoot him right now just saying

[5:15:08] <%nekodelic> @kaisermario I've never been so glad that a game that I am expecting for a long time got a delay. Bloodlines 2 was looking pretty rough in the released footage
[5:15:09] <Djinnazz> I wanna snitch!
[5:15:10] <asurite_warrior> god pat is one hell of a goblin snitch
[5:15:16] <%torontototoro> Sanjar is best boy. Strange that you can't immediately snitch to him

[5:16:16] <Seraphile> visit fallbrooke
[5:16:18] <%torontototoro> @AngriestPat finish Monarch at least. best part of the game imo
[5:16:21] <%derap41> If you have 2 sessions left you could if you ignore some crap missions
[5:16:22] <%MightyMaxT> I'm also getting sleepy but it wss a good time

[5:18:03] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> dat class is fuckered right up the pooper
[5:18:22] <KaiserMario> @AngriestPat Will podcast be at 13h as usual?
[5:18:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> Very fuckered up
[5:18:26] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah maybe just do the work to get the A and don't listen to a word that fucker says
[5:18:27] <%nekodelic> @kaisermario the animations were ROUGH with full caps, I'm still excited for the game (even more now). You just convinced me to buy Dishonored, it was already on my wishlist, but I'll make it a bigger priority now
[5:18:31] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Awesome! I cant wait to see Pat's reactions to everything!
[5:18:43] <%bread_assassin> I'm not gonna lie. DS seems like it'll be stream poison.
[5:19:20] <+Elky3> we can see his tummy RPGAyaya
[5:19:38] <KaiserMario> @nekodelic Good! Dishonored is great! I'm sure you'll enjoy it
[5:19:47] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I hope we can power thru DS, I REALLY wanna see Pat react to all the sick shit in the game
[5:19:55] <Dakuu75> lol
[5:20:15] <%XeroSigmaPrime> ohfff
[5:20:22] <MasterDecoder> @nekodelic Enjoy Dishonored, hope it doesn't poison you like it did PAt, I managed, but my Goblins aren't as bad as his

[5:21:58] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Shit hasn't really changed since then either. Epsecially in Pathfinder

[5:23:26] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @GeneralSCPatton Pathfinder was made by the 3.5 ed folks. You can also get all the stuff for free, from the folks who made it.
