[0:31:14] <%deathscythe122887> @patstaresat they accidentally switched the steam card descriptions for Achilies and Artemis

[0:31:45] <%Ranryu692> Divine Dash <3
[0:31:48] <%misha_kastrilevich> WHY DOES EVERYONE IN THIS GAME LOOK SO HOT?
[0:31:52] <penitentpentwitch> Divine D-nevermind
[0:31:53] <%Calek> @smacksfenton 10 seconds into playing it you'll know it's a good game
[0:31:57] <PatchySouls> Yes :D
[0:31:57] <Vaun0x> based cousin
[0:32:04] <peyodogo> hades is bisexual culture
[0:32:06] <rufus2k2> @Saltmeisterr I bet you can't pet Cerberus either >:(
[0:32:07] <%Ranryu692> it makes your defensive move more defensive
[0:32:07] <%Tenchi_G> Nice intro btw
[0:32:08] <Vashido22> its a dash with reflect, literally perfect
[0:32:10] <filialpails> they made a goddess out of aigis's persona?
[0:32:13] <%DappercatEsquire> i always liked going Ares/Doom when possible
[0:32:22] <bronzeaxe> in greek legend it is not Amoral to fuck your family
[0:32:27] <+Plus_On_Black> aight, what is the premise of this game?
[0:32:30] <%TheWinged7> furst ran
[0:32:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Athena is canonically Ace though
[0:32:40] <%ssjklyco> @misha_kastrilevich because it takes place in hell
[0:32:40] <%holydeviant1> Butterfly best trinket
[0:32:48] <%Daniel_Is_I> Pat of PatStaresAt
[0:32:49] <jacknerik> @Plus_On_Black the plot will be explained once he dies
[0:32:56] <AFlyingTaco1> Who?
[0:32:58] <%Calek> @Plus_On_Black you're Hades' son and you want to escape hell
[0:32:59] <+Arkfyre> Pat Looks At
[0:32:59] <%BoxNavy> pat quicklooks at
[0:32:59] <SirKeigan> Hi PT
[0:33:00] <%DappercatEsquire> @Plus_On_Black son of Hades wants to stop being in leave the underworld
[0:33:02] <SirKeigan> Hi Pat
[0:33:02] <+pectusumbra> things have changed again anyway so it's all good
[0:33:04] <+flexin_apex> Ok I’m sold I’m getting it on switch
[0:33:04] <penitentpentwitch> It mostly depends on weapons for me. I like Doom on slow weapons, I like DoTs and Stacking effects on fast weapons.
[0:33:10] <spawnzie> Sword good
[0:33:16] <penitentpentwitch> I put Crits on every build though
[0:33:19] <jacknerik> @Plus_On_Black all you need to know right now is this guy is in hades and the Olympian gods are helping him escape
[0:33:25] <%CrematedCube> Everyone in the Greek pantheon is crazy sexy, and that is canon
[0:33:26] <%Saltmeisterr> @flexin_apex get it on pc
[0:33:26] <SirKeigan> I'm Sir Keigan. It's the first three letters of my first and last name combined to make a new name
[0:33:27] <Lophostrix_> did he start a new save or is this his first time playing???
[0:33:28] <%BoxNavy> i left to get food did his progress get scrubbed?
[0:33:28] <%Dementedpenguin> You know.... if I blur my eyes, Zagreus looks like Seiya LUL
[0:33:28] <%misha_kastrilevich> @ssjklyco Ha ha
[0:33:30] <%Nordguy> it works great on the switch!
[0:33:35] <%holydeviant1> When I use fists, I like charm and frost, because I do Privelidge builds
[0:33:48] <SirTrae> I love the lance, but that's probably because I always love polearms in games
[0:33:51] <%Saltmeisterr> is the switch port good?
[0:33:54] <Vashido22> @patstaresat fun fact: same engine as Bastion
[0:33:55] <spawnzie> Supergiant has 1 (one) perspective
[0:33:57] <JustYudha> The pretty art
[0:33:57] <%Saltmeisterr> it seemed doo doo
[0:34:02] <penitentpentwitch> A lot of the QoL problems from Bastion and Transistor are solved in this game, which is nice
[0:34:02] <extradopeness> When my check hits I’m buying this immediately
[0:34:03] <%BoxNavy> The bastion
[0:34:07] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt don't forget your B move
[0:34:09] <+AYAYABaron> Bastion Kreygasm
[0:34:10] <Calek> @Saltmeisterr been playing it all day and it's been perfect
[0:34:12] <+Plus_On_Black> thank ya'll for the answers.
[0:34:13] <%Zabrewulf_X> Poseidon dash is op. My favorite build is Artemis /Poseidon trident. Criticals and knockbacks ftw.
[0:34:14] <PatchySouls> HE'S A CHAD NOW
[0:34:15] <bronzeaxe> Karen
[0:34:15] <reonome> charon has a face now
[0:34:17] <%Regigangster> It feels like you were gearing up for this game
[0:34:18] <%BoxNavy> he aint lookin so good
[0:34:25] <ShichiNoBushi> Charen
[0:34:26] <rufus2k2> remember hwen he had no model?
[0:34:28] <hot_take_jake> I like to pronounce it as Sharron
[0:34:28] <%Saltmeisterr> @Calek hows the framerate?
[0:34:28] <+AYAYABaron> I still have Build The Wall as my alarmtone
[0:34:30] <+oda_flobunaga> Karen? KAREN? Fuck this dude
[0:34:30] <%Daniel_Is_I> I love the names Supergiant gives the enemies in their games. Windbags, Jerks, Louts, etc.
[0:34:31] <+Solutha> Skeleton for paige
[0:34:35] <%DappercatEsquire> my best runs were always with the bow
[0:34:35] <extradopeness> Pay this man
[0:34:45] <sanslogic> Is that the Death you can fuck?
[0:34:46] <%Calek> @Saltmeisterr it's a solid 60
[0:34:57] <reonome> yes
[0:35:00] <spawnzie> Be sure to look at the shinies
[0:35:05] <reonome> it is him
[0:35:05] <JaydenSai> Man the art of the gods is so good
[0:35:07] <count_bob> Don't forget to look at the golden glowy spot.
[0:35:09] <jacknerik> That's me :)
[0:35:10] <%Ranryu692> that's not Hades, that's Zagreus
[0:35:13] <AoiRob> you mean Lord Hades or Zag
[0:35:14] <Vashido22> Darren Korb voices Zagreus and Skelly. He also does all the music of course
[0:35:14] <hot_take_jake> Kar-Ron doesn't want to wear a mask, and DEMANDS you bring their order our RIGHT THIS SECOND
[0:35:16] <%ssjklyco> He is charon for you
[0:35:18] <penitentpentwitch> Always activated those yellow Lore Dots, so you can snark at the narrator
[0:35:18] <Vashido22> dude's talented

[0:39:25] <rbakervv> @arcielardor just hit 1.0 today
[0:39:25] <%arcielardor> oh holy shit!
[0:39:26] <%iamnolionheart> Godmode makes you stronger each time you die so the story is still accessible to people who don't gel with the gameplay
[0:39:29] <s1rcuit> did you see how one of the heads was shadowed and ominous looking?
[0:39:30] <Vashido22> @aflyingtaco1 ye
[0:39:30] <arkv01> the voice distortion is always cool

[0:41:44] <%arcielardor> makes sense Pat would choose the most shit weapon first.
[0:41:47] <+dmtjinni> Pat Stares at Soulslikes? Perhaps?.. In Future?
[0:41:48] <%mike2hands> that name is a little unoriginal
[0:41:48] <s1rcuit> I'm of the impression that Skelly was hired by Hades himself
[0:41:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @waltzqueen I am uncertain. I've been holding off on getting this until 1.0, so perhaps I'll know soon enough. Dialogue does bring up Achilles though
[0:41:51] <Vashido22> @patstaresat zagreus and skelly are voiced by the same dude btw
[0:41:51] <+yoshkosh20> if you have enough time to beat up the denizen of the underworld, you got enough time to clean your room!
[0:41:51] <PatchySouls> BTW
[0:41:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> the great thing about being Greek dead is that you never know if it's real.
[0:41:53] <%CrematedCube> Paige, it's another boyfriend for you
[0:41:54] <reonome> skelly is great
[0:41:54] <%Fooguwu> she loves his BONES

[0:42:21] <LeRouch_the_Rebel> Can you pick up the sword?
[0:42:23] <hot_take_jake> EY DONT DROP THOSE PIASANOS
[0:42:24] <VritraReiRei> @l3sovikk bow is very good in cast builds and the rapid fire hammer upgrade
[0:42:24] <%waltzqueen> @Valentinius_Anodyne i hope reuniting them gets you an Aphrodite related achievement
[0:42:24] <s1rcuit> @PatchySouls Really?
[0:42:25] <rufus2k2> what happens when you drop him to zero HP?
[0:42:28] <$NS120> Zag and Skelly are both Darren Korb
[0:42:31] <+dmtjinni> im taking break from pat brb

[0:43:22] <reonome> @hot_take_jake hades himself
[0:43:24] <rufus2k2> just woulda liked to hear more of his bony wit
[0:43:24] <AFlyingTaco1> So who is Zagreus' father?
[0:43:25] <@JustinianKnight> Zeus is probably worse than Hades lol
[0:43:27] <LordOfThePoultry> 2
[0:43:27] <SchroedingersFerret> It's goose dad
[0:43:27] <$NS120> Logan Cunningham is Hades, Achilles, and the Narrator

[0:43:37] <%holydeviant1> Early runs really demonstrate how important all the mirror buffs are
[0:43:38] <Psyramics> Zeus: I like the look of you. I think an ostrich will be good for you, yes

[0:43:53] <s1rcuit> Zeus has no business complaining about other's being difficult
[0:43:57] <aero160h> has Pat said which roguelikes he would be playing or is it all a surprise?
[0:44:03] <jacknerik> He's a god
[0:44:03] <AoiRob> yeah Zag the protag boy is Hades' son
[0:44:05] <%Ranryu692> he got better
[0:44:05] <$joylent_blue> hence Zeus and Poseidon being Zag's uncles
[0:44:12] <%Regigangster> He's a god, Pat. He cant die
[0:44:13] <%waltzqueen> Zeus is a FuckBoi
[0:44:16] <xxshadowxx416> no hade his stepdad

[0:44:22] <@JustinianKnight> Gungeon and Star Renegades tomorrow
[0:44:23] <sanslogic> Zeus: Yeah all these monsters are tough, have you tried fucking it?
[0:44:25] <%misha_kastrilevich> Zeus has had the clap so much it sounds more like an applause
[0:44:27] <reonome> hades is his dad
[0:44:29] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @aero160h He has eluded to a few, but I believe it's mostly a surprise
[0:44:36] <axelkaspar> Greed
[0:44:39] <penitentpentwitch> Heart increases Max Health
[0:44:43] <$NS120> According to the Wiki Logan is ALSO Asterius, Poseidon, and Charon
[0:44:48] <ShichiNoBushi> Don't worry, Money.
[0:44:48] <CrystalLightPeachTea> So is this a roguelite then?
[0:44:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @aero160h Could totally be wrong though
[0:44:57] <aero160h> @reonome okay thanks for the info
[0:45:03] <+Double_Tap_That> @crystallightpeachtea Yes
[0:45:07] <%Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[0:45:07] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[0:45:08] <AoiRob> yeah the godlike rougelike
[0:45:10] <spawnzie> I think pat doesn't even know about the aspects
[0:45:11] <AFlyingTaco1> I mean isn't this game just the evolution of Bastion?
[0:45:21] <peyodogo> this music is fuckin incredibe
[0:45:21] <penitentpentwitch> @CrystalLightPeachTea Yup. Darkness is 'experience points' between runs
[0:45:23] <%Ranryu692> you can dash that gap
[0:45:30] <%BoxNavy> pyre is ded
[0:45:34] <PatchySouls> LUL
[0:45:34] <Vashido22> Pyre is still great tho
[0:45:37] <+dmtjinni> psaGiefrail
[0:45:40] <+Minorou> I was wondering why Pyre was skipped
[0:45:44] <+pectusumbra> pyre is a totally different game so I think it'll be okay
[0:45:45] <AFlyingTaco1> Hey Pyre is still great
[0:45:45] <rufus2k2> pyre has so much good damn lore
[0:45:46] <axelkaspar> Pyre has some godly characters
[0:45:47] <Louie_Salmon> Pyre is rad in it's own way
[0:45:48] <k_af> Reading is pretty cool
[0:45:49] <s1rcuit> I like that the doors tell you what the prize is
[0:45:52] <spawnzie> pyre is mostly a visual novel
[0:45:53] <suikudo> forgot about pyre
[0:45:55] <%sporeian94> I can';t believe I wasted all day trying to get a 3080. I wanna blow my fucking brains out
[0:45:55] <hot_take_jake> Charles Barkley DLC for Pyre
[0:45:56] <%waltzqueen> Pyre has the best Story tho
[0:45:57] <+crackheadcontrol> I could never get into Pyre. The "sport" part was just uninteresting as a fan of sports and sports-adjacent games
[0:45:58] <lucas18293> @patstaresat how much do you intend to play this game?
[0:45:58] <Vashido22> Pyre still has the best lore and story free
[0:46:02] <%CrematedCube> They learned a lot about lore-building from it
[0:46:02] <AoiRob> bc this game shadowdropped today
[0:46:09] <lucas18293> pyre is amazing
[0:46:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> NBA 2K20 taught kids hoe slot machines work.
[0:46:11] <LorcaNomad> how's the 1.0 patch been so far pat?
[0:46:17] <%holydeviant1> Pyre is cool, but I can't get a handle of the sportsy ball
[0:46:18] <arkv01> nice nice
[0:46:26] <%BoxNavy> no
[0:46:30] <%Broand> Rogue lite!
[0:46:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so, is Pat NOT testing the Switch version?
[0:46:32] <wibbwobbler> !!!
[0:46:33] <penitentpentwitch> So question for chat? Should Hades be pushed until he finishes it once or just one set for tonight and move on to next Roguelike?
[0:46:35] <JaseAdrift> nO
[0:46:45] <%holydeviant1> Get out of here, Berlin Interpretation stans
[0:46:48] <Robot_Nixon_> CoolStoryBob go on
[0:46:51] <AFlyingTaco1> Yup
[0:46:51] <spawnzie> that's Like/Lite
[0:46:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> hades is not a roguelike.
[0:46:53] <%Zabrewulf_X> @PatStaresAt I just got a 4k monitor. It is now easier to see you in the corner.
[0:46:55] <cyb3r_demon> its sugur free
[0:46:58] <%DappercatEsquire> roguelite big metaprogression
[0:47:01] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Have you read about the convention on roguelikes?
[0:47:02] <suikudo> spelunky 2 is coming out soon
[0:47:04] <+Double_Tap_That> Nope
[0:47:06] <AoiRob> thanks professor pat
[0:47:07] <Daxalog> Likes are like Angband and such.
[0:47:07] <cyb3r_demon> diet rogue
[0:47:10] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt in what order are your favorite SuperGiant Games?
[0:47:10] <LeRouch_the_Rebel> Slay the Spire is gonna be good
[0:47:10] <+crackheadcontrol> there's also the "Roguelikes are only turn based and ascii" crazy people
[0:47:13] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt I didn't know the difference, thanks!
[0:47:14] <%Ranryu692> Boons are 150
[0:47:15] <spawnzie> Hades is big Lite
[0:47:17] <%Saltmeisterr> hades has so much meta progression
[0:47:20] <%Spydurman> what's a rogue game then?
[0:47:20] <RayMan799> knaaawwwwleggg
[0:47:22] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Think you and/or Woolie will stream the new content for DMCV SE?
[0:47:27] <%ssjklyco> 00.
[0:47:30] <raikagelord1> Hate to ask but is this the beginning of the game?
[0:47:34] <Louie_Salmon> I think a true roguelike would gain you literally nothing, but that would be kinda boring nowadays
[0:47:40] <%crimsonharvest> Rogue is the game that came before Moria, nethack, and angband
[0:47:41] <k_af> haha oh Charon
[0:47:41] <jacknerik> @Spydurman an old game from like the 80s
[0:47:41] <dungpie64> Where did the rogue part originate from pat ?
[0:47:41] <s1rcuit> he looks rad!
[0:47:42] <%SWFanatic> Next on Boomer Pat: Boomer Pat explains the history of beep bloops
[0:47:43] <penitentpentwitch> A good tip for Charon: Don't go to Charon unless you have over 300 coin or under 40% HP.
[0:47:48] <%Daniel_Is_I> SourPls
[0:47:49] <%holydeviant1> Berlin Interpratation is the most common identifier for the split between like/lite, and the split is because it's a pretty big difference
[0:47:50] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[0:47:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> most games that call themselves roguelikes aren't even really roguelikes.
[0:47:51] <JaseAdrift> love the art SO MUCH
[0:47:54] <%CrematedCube> They made those god pickups so fancy now
[0:47:54] <+pectusumbra> @raikagelord1 it's like first 30 miniutes or so
[0:47:54] <Louie_Salmon> @raikagelord1 Basically, there's a tutorial run before this
[0:47:55] <coracor> @raikagelord1 if he's getting that dialogue, it's a very early run
[0:47:56] <$joylent_blue> ScreamLord i'd be willing to bet they will both check it out separately
[0:47:57] <Vashido22> SourPls
[0:47:58] <LordOfThePoultry> SourPls
[0:48:01] <%DappercatEsquire> @dungpie64 the original game Rogue
[0:48:02] <AFlyingTaco1> @Spydurman The original roguelike was a game called Rogue that essentially created the genre IIRC
[0:48:04] <anAngryHamster> WTF is Woolie playing???
[0:48:06] <+Double_Tap_That> Roguelikes are pretty much anything that plays like Rogue. Stuff like Nethack and Adventure mode Dwarf Fortress.
[0:48:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt for explaining the difference, I really never knew and originally had been avoiding most "rogue" games. I guess I prefer Roguelites starting off.
[0:48:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> @dungpie64 A game from the 1980s called Rogue.
[0:48:17] <%crimsonharvest> if anyone wants to know about classic roguelikes i'll be over here decaying into ancient age
[0:48:19] <ScreamLord> @joylent_blue Probably

[0:48:59] <cyb3r_demon> drank
[0:48:59] <Louie_Salmon> HIMBO
[0:49:00] <Jontman42> Dionysus isn't fat enough
[0:49:02] <%misha_kastrilevich> DIONYSUS!
[0:49:02] <wibbwobbler> SICK
[0:49:02] <AoiRob> ASS
[0:49:02] <Vashido22> @patstaresat Pyre is basically where they got the gang of a lot of text and lore. It will still be a nice experience
[0:49:03] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Dionysus, fantastic
[0:49:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I like how Roguelikes are very pick-up-and-play
[0:49:06] <%Regigangster> It's Himbos all the way down
[0:49:06] <penitentpentwitch> Premium-
[0:49:07] <LorcaNomad> Love this version of Dion
[0:49:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> the last real Roguelike that got any press was Dungeons of Dredmoor
[0:49:07] <Blank9> Turns out Pat has really good timing for a rogue marathon, World of Horror's getting a huge update in a week
[0:49:09] <JaseAdrift> WHY IS EVEYRONE SO HOT
[0:49:09] <AFlyingTaco1> Hello beautiful
[0:49:09] <$joylent_blue> LIFT THE LEG A LITTLE BIT MOR- damn

[0:49:16] <%Zabrewulf_X> psaUp
[0:49:22] <+Rada150> still no Pan, or hestia, cmon
[0:49:22] <Blank9> and Cadence of Hyrule's getting a new skull kid campaign in 2 weeks
[0:49:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so Slay the Spire is Roguelite? because you have some permanent upgrades?
[0:49:24] <AoiRob> that ass looks pretty fat to me
[0:49:26] <Vashido22> BOOM, EVERYONE IS HOT
[0:49:31] <LeRouch_the_Rebel> Dionysus should look more like John Belushi than John Stamos
[0:49:32] <+Rada150> or herculese
[0:49:34] <jacknerik> I always love peopel discovering how fucking rad the character designs in this are the first time
[0:49:34] <%Garthunox> its refreshing to play a game based on greek myth where the gods.are HELPING YOU!
[0:49:39] <+Rada150> herakles*
[0:49:40] <%Bearjewpiter> @ShinobiPhoenix I was thinking that as well
[0:49:40] <s1rcuit> so Dionysus is also known as the mad god because he make mortals go crazy and kill each other
[0:49:42] <%codycurry52> is this the switch version?
[0:49:43] <%Garthunox> gods are*
[0:49:48] <%SWFanatic> are ya winnin son?
[0:49:52] <jacknerik> @codycurry52 no
[0:49:56] <%Zabrewulf_X> CRIT
[0:49:56] <%Saltmeisterr> BEST GIRL
[0:49:58] <penitentpentwitch> Artemis, all the crits!
[0:49:59] <+Rada150> also i know hestia is an aspect but she needs god boons
[0:50:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> BEST GIRL
[0:50:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Speaking of Roguelikes, I found out that Shiren the Wanderer 5 PC has a real release date now, so I'm looking forward to that
[0:50:05] <%CrematedCube> I think Bacchus is the fatter wino man
[0:50:06] <$joylent_blue> codycurry52 no this is pc
[0:50:06] <%Ranryu692> Artemis is best girl
[0:50:07] <%waltzqueen> HUNTING LESBIAN YAY
[0:50:08] <JaseAdrift> A game where the gods arent being dicks
[0:50:08] <Parapattern> I LOVE U ARTEMIS
[0:50:09] <Vashido22> BEST GIRL FREE
[0:50:12] <@JustinianKnight> thats the Roman one
[0:50:14] <LordOfThePoultry> artemis PogChamp
[0:50:17] <+Rada150> Diana is roman artimes
[0:50:18] <%Ne1son> Dianan is roman
[0:50:19] <%Saltmeisterr> diana is her roman name
[0:50:19] <@JustinianKnight> yes
[0:50:23] <Mr_Rakjo> Diana Roman, Artemis Greek @PatStaresAt
[0:50:26] <Vashido22> Cute AND WITH CRITS. PERFECT GIRL
[0:50:28] <AoiRob> @ShinobiPhoenix not really. you dont really start your run more powered up than before. you just find more shit throughout runs
[0:50:28] <+pectusumbra> Diana is her roman name yeah
[0:50:28] <Louie_Salmon> @shinobiphoenix Nah that's closer to roguelike, the only unlocks are additional cards and relics to a pool. Certainly arguable
[0:50:29] <UnfilteredComic> Dash shot is really good
[0:50:31] <The_Nightmare_Emperor> Yeah I believe Diana is her roman name
[0:50:32] <%codycurry52> @joylent_blue thanks
[0:50:32] <%iamnolionheart> I think the biggest thing I shoot for is circumventing armor in some way
[0:50:34] <+Rada150> also no apollo
[0:50:36] <+Double_Tap_That> Artemis is best because she deliver those crits.
[0:50:36] <spawnzie> Best girl is either Artemis or Euridice
[0:50:40] <sanslogic> it's Link!
[0:50:41] <anAngryHamster> Artemis Fowl, now on Disney Plus
[0:50:41] <axelkaspar> TOMBOY
[0:50:43] <PatchySouls> Kappa
[0:50:46] <+ImpHelpSingIt> im not like other girls
[0:50:47] <ergulor> the tsundere
[0:50:47] <%Treuan> Best girl
[0:50:47] <stormhawk9891> BEST GIRL
[0:50:49] <+Solutha> cute
[0:50:49] <%SirGO0SE> shes not like those other girls
[0:50:49] <s1rcuit> @Rada150 she needs to be a god that bestows boons
[0:50:51] <@JustinianKnight> the moon on her design
[0:50:52] <penitentpentwitch> Pressure Points! Yeah!
[0:50:54] <@JustinianKnight> a very nice touch
[0:50:54] <JaseAdrift> Kreygasm
[0:50:55] <%valriot> C R I T
[0:50:55] <%Typhaeon> Best girl is obviously the one we're going to see in a few rooms
[0:50:57] <+yoshkosh20> awkward hunting nerd
[0:50:58] <+pectusumbra> True shot is one of my favorite casts
[0:50:59] <penitentpentwitch> Guh
[0:51:05] <ScreamLord> @waltzqueen More like a Hunting Ace. Artemis thinks sex is gross
[0:51:12] <CrystalLightPeachTea> what was that pomegranate?
[0:51:15] <+Double_Tap_That> I feel like pressure points was nerfed.
[0:51:19] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I used to avoid the whole rogue thing, I still don't think I'm great at it and haven't beaten any, but I have more of them now then I ever thought I would. Hades (twice now), Cadence of Hyrule, Slay the Spire, Sword of Ditto
[0:51:21] <+LordSkitzleton> Money isn't really worth it in this game
[0:51:26] <%SirGO0SE> @Typhaeon the step on me queen
[0:51:28] <%waltzqueen> @ScreamLord Even Better
[0:51:37] <%BoxNavy> psaCrazyhand
[0:51:42] <%holydeviant1> For good Roguelikes, I personally rec Stone Soup, Caves of Qud, and Dungeons of Dredmor, along with DoomRL and Incursion (Halls of the goblin king)
[0:51:42] <rufus2k2> crazy talk
[0:51:43] <+queaks> Artemis has sex with her wood nymph friends
[0:51:43] <%SWFanatic> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaHoldon
[0:51:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and Dead Cells is Soulslike Roguelite?
[0:51:48] <AoiRob> Pom lets you increase ATK on one move
[0:51:50] <@JustinianKnight> gemeralds
[0:51:54] <%Saltmeisterr> money is defintely worth it
[0:51:55] <%kknutson4> best weapon = spear
[0:52:01] <andresisant> Should I buy it on steam
[0:52:02] <jacknerik> @holydeviant1 Qud fucking rules
[0:52:03] <%CrematedCube> Pomegranite = Ability-up
[0:52:09] <andresisant> I cave nad bought in epic
[0:52:09] <AFlyingTaco1> @ShinobiPhoenix Moreso just a roguelike
[0:52:10] <+LordSkitzleton> Best weapon = fists
[0:52:14] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt jewels are for house upgrades/cosmetics
[0:52:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Tales of Maj'Eyal is also a good (classic) roguelike I recommend :)
[0:52:19] <%holydeviant1> (But, uh, get an older version of Stone Soup, they seem hell-bent on removing features)
[0:52:20] <%DappercatEsquire> getting the daedalus upgrade for the bow that increases damage per hit of the special, then more arrows, and then just annihilate shit
[0:52:29] <Louie_Salmon> @shinobiphoenix Yup, exactly, you get objective upgrades for more heals and stuff
[0:52:33] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt the gems are money for in between runs
[0:52:41] <+Double_Tap_That> I dunno, I've had my best runs with GUN.
[0:52:46] <%BoxNavy> 🔑
[0:52:55] <%logoth_> Munney
[0:53:00] <%Daniel_Is_I> Gun is good
[0:53:01] <%holydeviant1> @jacknerik Hell, yeah! Esper for easy wins
[0:53:04] <AoiRob> well Deadcells lets you upgrade healing and weapon levels so it falls more in Lite
[0:53:05] <Vashido22> my best runs are always sword
[0:53:07] <Vashido22> I love it
[0:53:08] <+pectusumbra> different weapons like different gods is all
[0:53:10] <%Daniel_Is_I> But fists murder everything
[0:53:21] <Vashido22> fists are OD
[0:53:22] <AoiRob> Shield best weapon
[0:53:26] <%waltzqueen> LUL
[0:53:31] <@JustinianKnight> welcome to the BONE ZONE
[0:53:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I haven't played for a while, even though nothing is stopping me from playing my Steam version, but I was doing well with Bow

[0:53:44] <k_af> romance the skeletons
[0:53:47] <%SWFanatic> psaUp
[0:53:51] <jacknerik> Its the land of the dead you *weren't* expecting skelly boys cryptThink
[0:53:51] <%emperordread> is skeletonism like racism but for creatures with carapaces?
[0:53:56] <Vashido22> @s1rcuit not a fan of the shield
[0:53:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Well, yeah
[0:53:59] <%ssjklyco> Aren't all the gods family?
[0:54:05] <+Double_Tap_That> Shield with the right upgrades means you're basically invincible
[0:54:06] <@JustinianKnight> most are
[0:54:07] <%CrematedCube> Her dad is Zeus, so yeah

[0:54:33] <+pectusumbra> shot or discharge are both solid
[0:54:33] <%Ranryu692> jolted is pretty good
[0:54:36] <%CrematedCube> Chain lightning is a personal fav
[0:54:37] <Louie_Salmon> A shop is like, the opposite of money

[0:55:13] <axelkaspar> TSUN
[0:55:13] <%goose_attack_almanac> @ssjklyco All the gods are family technically. Though Aphrodite wasn't really conceived more that she took shape out of the bloody mixture of a castrated titan scrotum and salt water
[0:55:14] <%Ranryu692> @Valentinius_Anodyne lol
[0:55:16] <AFlyingTaco1> It's so weird hearing the Narrator not be a smarmy shit like he is in Pyre

[0:56:51] <%TheWinged7> @ShinobiPhoenix yes, very much so it is ok to be intimidated, just try some of the weapons you think you will like early on, take your time, and enjoy the gameplay
[0:56:51] <%Saltmeisterr> yes
[0:56:51] <+pectusumbra> yes, that's what athena does

[0:57:19] <andresisant> @l3sovikk You are correct
[0:57:19] <+ReiDuran> Zagreus actually used to be a form of Dionysus, actually the first one who was a son of Zeus and Persephone. He was born early and then sewn into Zeus's leg to be born later "properly"
[0:57:34] <+michingmallecho> I can’t see SourPls
[0:57:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @dmtjinni You got BTTV enabled? You need it for that

[0:58:43] <%CrematedCube> Greek myths were basically a thousand fanfics stitched together
[0:58:44] <aeonicvector> Its pronounced TEEDUS, like the company of champions killed

[0:59:52] <%Typhaeon> No, not those gamer words
[1:00:06] <%Regigangster> Why is the game super horny?
[1:00:18] <Louie_Salmon> Pat going on a roguelike Pissventure, not even he knows where the stream will go this time
[1:00:23] <%ShawnTK_> because greek was very horny
[1:00:26] <+callowbrodie> What if he accidently kisses the toilet
[1:00:29] <BiologicGases> oh no if they kiss Paige will get pragernat
[1:00:33] <%ShawnTK_> Greek said "Everything is sex"
[1:00:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Regigangster It's accurate to the source material
[1:00:52] <AoiRob> stream over ;A;
[1:00:55] <+michingmallecho> Zeus turned into an ant and had a son named Myrmidon (ant-man). Let that sink in
[1:00:56] <Make_me_mad> The greek gods are great and remain the most realistic depiction of a godlike pantheon that humanity has ever created.
[1:01:05] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Hello
[1:01:06] <%emperordread> What if on the way to the bathroom, Pat picks up the spreadshot piss powerup, and pisses all over the everywhere?
[1:01:06] <%Jay_Squirrel> what toilet perks did you pick up
[1:01:12] <%mike2hands> did you wash yah hands?
[1:01:13] <blitzmentalist> Void of Piss
[1:01:15] <Make_me_mad> Because they're all fucking terrible and petty jerks who never face consequences for their actions.
[1:01:17] <JaseAdrift> pat didnt wash his hands
[1:01:20] <ScreamLord> Piss fuels you tho
[1:01:22] <%linSP> holy SHIT when is the 3080 coming our

[1:01:50] <sanslogic> TIME FOR F I R E
[1:01:51] <+Promessa_EX> [retty fire
[1:01:52] <InaccurateLad> Just bought hades today. This game is super fun!
[1:01:56] <devanmuse> narrator is probably Homer
[1:01:57] <+michingmallecho> I thought the Greek gods were cool from Disney’s Hercules, imagine watching the Kevin Sorbo Hercules and seeing a bunch of dicks then reading the Iliad and odyssey and well, you kinda get it
[1:01:58] <%Typhaeon> I got to a point where I sort of softlocked myself in this game, couldn't clear the entire thing, couldn't get more resources
[1:02:01] <ShichiNoBushi> Is the narrarator's voice diagetic?
[1:02:02] <+Promessa_EX> now it's rad
[1:02:19] <coracor> scintillating is a good word
[1:02:19] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt when was the last time you played this game if you dont mind me asking
[1:02:22] <+pectusumbra> so yeah, don't stand in the fire
[1:02:26] <AoiRob> yeah Zag banters with narrator
[1:02:30] <%Saltmeisterr> what does diagetic mean?
[1:02:31] <blitzmentalist> LUL
[1:02:32] <@SSaryn> VERY COOL
[1:02:34] <Vashido22> zagreus hears the narrator yeah
[1:02:44] <Vashido22> @Saltmeisterr basically that its part of the world itself
[1:02:45] <@SSaryn> Oh wow new room for Skull Crushers
[1:02:45] <Reisadan> AND THEN you decided to test that.
[1:02:51] <otakon17> and nearly killed before he even STARTS the damn stage
[1:02:56] <%Saltmeisterr> ah
[1:03:07] <%Saltmeisterr> i learned a new word today
[1:03:07] <%SWFanatic> Eekum Bokum?
[1:03:12] <%Saltmeisterr> thanks hades!
[1:03:13] <%Tearonex> Tearonex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Wooo 2 years of bald orb man! Glad you're playing Hades today, I just beat the final boss twice today hoping you get to see the new stuff they've added!
[1:03:18] <+Double_Tap_That> Eh, fire/lava levels are always my least favorite in any game. They typically have a palette of black and red.
[1:03:20] <AoiRob> rip run

[1:03:40] <derekwst3> i have to be at work in 6 hours....
[1:03:40] <+ReiDuran> Zagreus and Dionysus are so closely related, mythwise, that they might as well be the same person. As in the modern god we know as Dionysus is really just Zagreus with the edges filed off.
[1:03:46] <+michingmallecho> And that’s the end of my story
[1:03:49] <ret1357> with athena dash, dash into projectiles
[1:03:50] <otakon17> Taking The Floor Is Lava to the LOGICAL extreme
[1:03:51] <ShichiNoBushi> @Saltmeisterr Diagetic means it is in the real world and not just what the audience sees or hears.
[1:03:54] <0rond> did pat do it yet? did he beat the game?
[1:03:54] <%JD_Lars> So what do you keep after runs?
[1:04:03] <0rond> oh guess not
[1:04:03] <JaseAdrift> sorry meg
[1:04:04] <+michingmallecho> I like his little quote after dying

[1:04:38] <Louie_Salmon> Mom and dad are fighting BibleThump
[1:04:42] <reonome> missing
[1:04:44] <%Dementedpenguin> Influencers WutFace
[1:04:51] <Vashido22> you'll see
[1:04:51] <+michingmallecho> but daddy’s not drunk
[1:04:54] <%weissguard> Confirmed Hades hates Influencers.
[1:04:56] <@SSaryn> Yes.
[1:04:56] <%Jeemukun> also god of gold
[1:04:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Morbidmort That's a bit of a big plot point, I believe
[1:04:59] <aeonicvector> Primoridals are stronger
[1:05:01] <@SSaryn> Also you'll see.
[1:05:03] <AFlyingTaco1> Oh man you can just see the influences of all their other games oozing into this one and it's wonderful
[1:05:04] <+linSP> Remember when nxy was organization XIII
[1:05:05] <$personmanthingg> probably higher
[1:05:05] <+Shacklebox> low, like real low
[1:05:06] <s1rcuit> pretty high
[1:05:12] <+pectusumbra> In Greek, it's before the Titans
[1:05:16] <+yoshkosh20> hades sounds like an angry hermit dad
[1:05:16] <+Shacklebox> fuck
[1:05:17] <+Double_Tap_That> Or, you know, primordial Chaos.
[1:05:18] <penitentpentwitch> "Death"

[1:05:23] <%Treuan> Booze!
[1:05:24] <OperatorJo_> yeh
[1:05:25] <Vashido22> sure, fuck it
[1:05:25] <+ReiDuran> Hades isn't a BAD GUY. He's actually a pretty sane god compared to the others in the Greek pantheon.
[1:05:26] <+goose_attack_almanac> Nyx is one step down from *creation*
[1:05:26] <otakon17> The Moon
[1:05:27] <coracor> hey its an important part of the human experience
[1:05:28] <%UvBenServed> LUL
[1:05:31] <%Broand> Getting wasted is extremely important
[1:05:31] <%Jeemukun> WINE'S IMPORTANT PAT
[1:05:34] <LordOfThePoultry> yup
[1:05:34] <sanslogic> The Greeks really loved their wine
[1:05:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Getting wasted, AND Divine Madness
[1:05:37] <otakon17> oh hey exclamation point
[1:05:38] <+Promessa_EX> kero-chan
[1:05:41] <@SSaryn> We all need a drink every now and then after all
[1:05:41] <+pectusumbra> Wine is literally divine
[1:05:44] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt he's at work
[1:05:45] <$Aitch971> I mean he is also madness and revelry is he not
[1:05:48] <raikagelord1> Hephaestus is the god of forge and fire.
[1:05:48] <otakon17> they look like Mets!
[1:05:48] <+yoshkosh20> hades was manly taciturn and kinda lonely
[1:05:50] <AoiRob> out on a walk
[1:05:56] <JaseAdrift> wine dood its great
[1:05:58] <%blastyoboots> If you rank them in terms of their "impact to the lives of mortals", getting wasted and love&jealousy are SUPER POWERFUL
[1:05:58] <KaiserMario> Many things have been accomplished by drunks and drunkness
[1:06:01] <%MelBrooksKA> Ancient people really liked getting kronkl
[1:06:01] <%BravelySegfault> Drunk god of pathfinder forgot how he became a god
[1:06:04] <ShichiNoBushi> Primordial Deities are concepts that are very basic such as light, darkness, void. Titans represent more natural aspects. Olympian gods represent things more associated with humanity and civilization.
[1:06:10] <$realm_forge> Gettin krunk is a force of nature
[1:06:14] <+Snorlax321> he might have been a death god a one point
[1:06:16] <%blastyoboots> also under that criteria Night is super OP
[1:06:17] <+Shubreaker> a key point to remember always is that the "god of death" and the "god of the dead" are NOT the same person
[1:06:19] <%RyTYoung> huh
[1:06:29] <0rond> they added achievements too
[1:06:30] <%fairore> hows hades guys
[1:06:32] <%Saltmeisterr> FIND DUSA
[1:06:32] <raikagelord1> This game released on steam yet?
[1:06:34] <+ReiDuran> @PatStaresAt The concept of "getting wasted" is due to a connection with an old cult dealing with the concept of rebirth, which is central to the connection between Zagreus and Dionysus. Wine was said to let the spirit of Dionysus into you and get you closer to godhood.
[1:06:44] <OperatorJo_> VERY true story
[1:06:44] <%full_circle> this game seems perfect for switch
[1:06:47] <+pectusumbra> Overly Sarcastic Productions has a fantastic video on Dionysus for anyone interested
[1:06:48] <@SSaryn> Steam, EGS and Switch.
[1:06:52] <otakon17> welp there's where the pupper went
[1:06:53] <%Regigangster> It's on switch too! :D
[1:06:56] <%Tearonex> Oh, Pat hasn't even opened the lounge yet
[1:06:58] <%ssjklyco> It has Cross save with the switch

[1:07:02] <JaseAdrift> lets fuck meg
[1:07:07] <0rond> did he start a new save file?

[1:07:16] <rekinom> She sounds like the voice actress from hercules
[1:07:16] <Vashido22> he did @0rond
[1:07:17] <penitentpentwitch> @PatStaresAt Do you want to play this until you beat this once on stream? Or just do one stream and move on to the next Rogue game?

[1:09:15] <%Broand> Try using a weapon stand you're equipped with already
[1:09:15] <lucas18293> @PatStaresAt when you and woolie were talking about unlimited hades content... there's two additional systems that change the game up equally as much as the mirror that you hadn't seen.
[1:09:16] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt you'll see after beating the game for the first time
[1:09:17] <1matheuw> ye and its awesome

[1:10:04] <%BoxNavy> sure?
[1:10:05] <LordOfThePoultry> makes sense
[1:10:08] <0rond> there isn't a lot of pretty green
[1:10:08] <%full_circle> that makes perfect sense
[1:10:09] <JaseAdrift> no one uses that green
[1:10:10] <Daxalog> What the fuck?
[1:10:10] <Robot_Nixon_> CoolStoryBob yea sure
[1:10:11] <Morbidmort> Radioactive green is a good sign
[1:10:12] <+JavaManJoJo> Ah yeah it means that the artist know what they're doing
[1:10:13] <+michingmallecho> But why green
[1:10:15] <AoiRob> totally
[1:10:15] <PatchySouls> ***
[1:10:19] <Make_me_mad> I like the way this game looks, but I think Pyre's the best looking thing they ever made. It's gorgeous.
[1:10:20] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt oh bouy you're gonna love pyre's visuals
[1:10:21] <@SSaryn> HE'S DEAD FOREVER not really

[1:10:27] <0rond> there are only like 2 pretty shades of green
[1:10:29] <KaiserMario> It's not just one green, they are using a gradient from a dark blue-green to a bright yellow-green
[1:10:30] <%BoxNavy> Jebaited
[1:10:34] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[1:10:36] <OperatorJo_> I mean, if you think of it art direction-wise it kind of makes sense?

[1:12:25] <%Dementedpenguin> I love it.
[1:12:28] <+Pomer> i'm so glad this game isn't trapped on epic anymore
[1:12:31] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt this game's "story excuse" on why is a roguelike is my favourite of any of the genre
[1:12:38] <%Saltmeisterr> i hove we get ares
[1:12:41] <otakon17> wait NYX is the mom?!
[1:12:43] <%Saltmeisterr> he cool

[1:12:49] <%Saltmeisterr> no
[1:12:50] <reonome> yes
[1:12:50] <artificiallynatural> underworld gods
[1:12:50] <count_bob> Underworld.
[1:12:51] <%Bailey__gaming> Yo peoples
[1:12:51] <aeonicvector> underworld
[1:12:53] <LordOfThePoultry> nope
[1:12:53] <%Ranryu692> yeah
[1:12:54] <Ids560> death ones
[1:12:55] <Tisaric> I really hope the cross saves come to switch soon and they work both ways
[1:12:55] <blitzmentalist> they're the gods beneath the earth
[1:12:56] <otakon17> The primordial aspects of reality
[1:12:56] <%Saltmeisterr> those are titans
[1:12:56] <+Pomer> @otakon17 allegedy
[1:12:59] <Vashido22> underworld
[1:13:00] <$NS120> yep, like Hypnos, who is sleep
[1:13:00] <lucas18293> @patstaresat Cthonic gods are underworld gods
[1:13:02] <LordOfThePoultry> yes
[1:13:04] <Vashido22> underworld gods
[1:13:05] <+pime_cone> Just means like underworld gods
[1:13:06] <CrematedCube> The ones that live in the underworld, not Olympus
[1:13:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> underworld gods (hell gods)
[1:13:07] <filialpails> cthonic means of the earth
[1:13:08] <+pectusumbra> cthonic gods are gods under the earth
[1:13:09] <The_Nightmare_Emperor> Yeah. Nyx and Thanatos are big ones
[1:13:12] <%NecDW4> Lit is lit fam
[1:13:13] <%Regigangster> It means subterranean
[1:13:13] <1matheuw> use it more
[1:13:14] <+Wizardism> lit dude
[1:13:15] <%misha_kastrilevich> I thought Persephone was Zagerus's mom
[1:13:15] <aeonicvector> Cthonic means underworld, primordials are primordial
[1:13:17] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt Cthonic are "dark" gods, Titans are pre-Olympian
[1:13:17] <+ImpHelpSingIt> straight yoted
[1:13:17] <ShichiNoBushi> Pre-Olympus. Pre-titans.
[1:13:18] <LeRouch_the_Rebel> I dont mind it
[1:13:18] <blitzmentalist> so Hades, Zagreus, Megaera and the other Furies, etc. are the Chthonic Gods
[1:13:19] <%Dementedpenguin> psaSmug
[1:13:20] <%SWFanatic> I prefer eekum bokum
[1:13:20] <%BoxNavy> you always pick on words when theyre outta style jermaOld
[1:13:20] <%ssjklyco> They LITerally hate it
[1:13:23] <SaltyAzteca> lit fam
[1:13:26] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Did your twitch manager tell you to say it more?
[1:13:30] <otakon17> I think Pat found his new favorite weapon
[1:13:30] <penitentpentwitch> They're 'gods of the underworld' quite a few of them branching from Nyx's family tree
[1:13:32] <+michingmallecho> Very lit, patrick
[1:13:32] <BiologicGases> I think you using it is lit
[1:13:42] <%CrematedCube> The undergods not the overgods
[1:13:46] <+FlubbedPig> Cthonic gods are just underworld gods. Hades isn't actually an olympian, he's cthonic.
[1:13:55] <%Monkeyweed21> more like Fartamis
[1:13:56] <otakon17> wee explodey lads
[1:14:05] <+michingmallecho> Pat is trying to get into the 18-49 demos. I respect it psaUp
[1:14:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> fun fact, in Yu-Gi-Oh english dubs and TCG, they used Chthonian as a replacement to avoid using the word "Hell" from the Japanese card names. Censorship!
[1:14:13] <0rond> it slaps
[1:14:15] <otakon17> man I should pick this up
[1:14:17] <+Thomzzz> I... LOVE the art for ur stream layout omfg
[1:14:19] <1matheuw> the underworld is pretty lit fam
[1:14:20] <0rond> YEYEYE ARTEMIS
[1:14:20] <Vashido22> it is indeed, as they say, lit
[1:14:21] <ShichiNoBushi> There are three tiers of Greek deities. The Primordial Deities are the ones that are associated with baser aspects.

[1:16:40] <otakon17> Dying Lament!
[1:16:42] <penitentpentwitch> Shotgun cast is decent
[1:16:42] <ergulor> some of those are great
[1:16:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> ayyy if it isn't the horniest pantheon in existence
[1:16:44] <Vashido22> cast is a fucking shotgun
[1:16:46] <%Calek> I'm so bad at using Cast
[1:16:49] <%iamnolionheart> Pat they're actually really strong
[1:16:51] <wibbwobbler> ON PRINCIPLE
[1:16:52] <T_Sasquatch> APHRODITE IS THE UGLIEST IN THE GAME
[1:16:53] <%NecDW4> Girthy cast
[1:16:54] <otakon17> yeah but it's SUPER short
[1:16:54] <%Tearonex> Ye, shotgun cast
[1:16:54] <@SSaryn> Pretty good cast and applies weak, can't go wrong
[1:16:57] <0rond> the are cousins, aphrodite is a daughter of zeus
[1:16:57] <Make_me_mad> Get that width
[1:16:59] <PatchySouls> It's a good thing Aphrodite was born from the cut-off dick from some Titan and reincarnated from sea foam
[1:17:00] <aeonicvector> 63 revenge damage is S Tier given the zeus "auto revenge"
[1:17:02] <1matheuw> you could say the cast is pretty thicc
[1:17:03] <%iamnolionheart> There's a boon that does a thing
[1:17:03] <Morbidmort> Wait, if she's the daughter of Uranos, then you aren't related at all
[1:17:08] <Louie_Salmon> This cast is just good for damage
[1:17:10] <+ClericOfSparda> ClericOfSparda subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! Hell yeah, my subversary! Glad it's during such a kick-ass game.

[1:17:10] <+ClericOfSparda> ClericOfSparda subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! Hell yeah, my subversary! Glad it's during such a kick-ass game.
[1:17:14] <Ids560> the revenge ones are fine once you've filled out the mirror a bit
[1:17:15] <Louie_Salmon> 100 is a LOT
[1:17:15] <%Saltmeisterr> those revenge boons are good with ares/zeus duo
[1:17:17] <PatchySouls> so she may or may not be biologically related to anyone??
[1:17:20] <coracor> WutFace
[1:17:23] <Klarrann3> @PatStaresAt There's an Ares boon that makes Revenge boons activate without taking damage
[1:17:25] <%weissguard> Jesus, what the heck?
[1:17:26] <otakon17> goddamn WHALLOPED man what a good combo you got going
[1:17:26] <%ClericOfSparda> well, twitch mobile is weird
[1:17:31] <+FlubbedPig> The "When you take damage" boons are useful with the duo that makes them just go off automatically.
[1:17:31] <%CrematedCube> It is... complicated.
[1:17:33] <+Solutha> casts are pretty meh til you get more stock
[1:17:39] <%ssjklyco> Time to fight Twerkiles, the god of jiggly butts

[1:18:11] <penitentpentwitch> Bounce shield is great against hordes of foes, and rarely are you not fighting hordes of foes
[1:18:14] <Make_me_mad> Did Supergiant include Priapus in this game or were they COWARDS?
[1:18:15] <%Daniel_Is_I> Well all the weapons can be nuts really
[1:18:15] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt the revenge ones work the best with Ares+Zeus because they have a Boon that *auto triggers* revenge skills without taking damage

[1:18:23] <ultimatemegahero1> Did Pat do any reaction vids to the PS5 and Nindo Direct streams?
[1:18:24] <blitzmentalist> oh wow
[1:18:25] <Klarrann3> @PatchySouls yeah, it just activates the effect when near enemies
[1:18:27] <%BonewheelVanguard> @PatStaresAt All the bot 3080 purchases are get their orders canceled and possibly IP banned
[1:18:30] <%Calek> there's upgrades that make your Special 10% faster which is a lie, it feels like twice as fast
[1:18:42] <PatchySouls> @Klarrann3 lmao that's definitely a Legendary boon
[1:18:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> Does BestGirl Persephone make an appearance?
[1:18:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so when you donate through the Streamlabs link for a message, how long does it take to show up?
[1:19:14] <Vashido22> good ass shield
[1:19:15] <otakon17> Special boost!
[1:19:18] <ultimatemegahero1> Cos I thought Pat would be excited for Monster Hunter Rise
[1:19:20] <penitentpentwitch> Nectar
[1:19:20] <%Saltmeisterr> @GarbageQueenEllie spoilers
[1:19:24] <Vashido22> SourPls
[1:19:30] <@SoFarFetched> Pat didn't stream the nintendo direct
[1:19:32] <otakon17> You've barely taken any damage this run to boot.
[1:19:34] <LordOfThePoultry> nectar
[1:19:35] <AoiRob> that mf shield is zip zoomin all over
[1:19:36] <+michingmallecho> Zeus transformed into a dragon to seduce Persephone, the first time, and out popped Zagreos...a motherfucking dragon
[1:19:36] <Klarrann3> @PatchySouls I don't remember if it is a Legendary one, but you can pay to see the requirements for boons now
[1:19:40] <Aydarkzero> he's doing it
[1:19:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Saltmeisterr Oooh that must mean there's some good shit coming up
[1:19:57] <otakon17> and I jinxed it!
[1:19:57] <%Calek> my current build has doom on special, and hangover with 6 damage every 0.3 seconds on attack, it's ridiculous
[1:20:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I donated, but my message hasn't showed up yet
[1:20:08] <%full_circle> full_circle subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! 4 months, hooray. I heard Zangief has learned to snort? Pretty soon he'll give hickeys, too. Have fun with that.
[1:20:10] <Vashido22> this game is easily my favourite adaptations of greek gods
[1:20:11] <%Andrizzleton> playing on the 3080? psaWhat
[1:20:12] <Vashido22> they're so good
[1:20:19] <The_Nightmare_Emperor> Charging Star!
[1:20:21] <$Aitch971> jesus this shield is nasty
[1:20:23] <Vashido22> SOCIAL LINK GO
[1:20:29] <stabbityrabbit> Pat beat the game yet?
[1:20:31] <@SoFarFetched> @ShinobiPhoenix Donations are read before and after the stream as long as it's a minimum of 5 dollars.
[1:20:39] <AoiRob> nope
[1:20:40] <Vashido22> @stabbityrabbit no
[1:20:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> But srsly tho it's almost as if the Greek mythos INVENTED horny
[1:20:55] <stabbityrabbit> Shid.
[1:20:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @SoFarFetched right, but I didn't even see my message come up at all
[1:21:02] <otakon17> needs the heals
[1:21:03] <ExpressNode> I didn't even know Pat was streaming because I didn't get a notification
[1:21:11] <otakon17> only enough for oNE
[1:21:14] <ultimatemegahero1> This game looks like Diablo if Diablo was actually fun Kappa
[1:21:16] <Klarrann3> a really fun build is to have the shield variation where the throw attack makes it so the shield spins in place and to have Zeus' boon to make special attacks deal lightning damage
[1:21:20] <%Tearonex> BEST GIRL ALERT
[1:21:26] <otakon17> more special!
[1:21:28] <aeonicvector> mark

[1:21:53] <%misha_kastrilevich> I'm so going to be using music from this game for D&D games
[1:21:56] <Aydarkzero> neat

[1:21:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Good old Charon
[1:21:59] <%Andrizzleton> everybody has a face now PogChamp
[1:21:59] <@SoFarFetched> Probably have to wait and see if the donation went through at the end.
[1:22:00] <Ids560> the gods can't hear him
[1:22:05] <%Regigangster> LUL
[1:22:07] <penitentpentwitch> Item get!
[1:22:11] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt i suggest giving your next Nectar to Skelly
[1:22:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @SoFarFetched so it's confusing because I've never donated before, so I don't know if it worked.
[1:22:15] <%Regigangster> HRRRRRNNGGGG
[1:22:18] <Vashido22> @misha_kastrilevich Pyre's ost also works great for that btw
[1:22:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Charon is a good friend
[1:22:18] <ShichiNoBushi> Confidant Rank Up!
[1:22:20] <$Dakuu75> Bro-mance
[1:22:20] <+pectusumbra> @Regigangster the blessings are like letters, it's one way talking, they don't hear back from him often
[1:22:22] <%Treuan> lewd
[1:22:27] <%BoxNavy> :)
[1:22:28] <%Saltmeisterr> keepsake pat
[1:22:30] <KaiserMario> A TIME BONER?
[1:22:31] <Klarrann3> hold L1 to view the codex
[1:22:36] <VritraReiRei> Skelly Trinket is an extra Death Defiance
[1:22:37] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt You can use it yet till you get back to the start
[1:22:39] <Vashido22> sup meg
[1:22:39] <otakon17> here we go, round 2
[1:22:48] <+JavaManJoJo> @PatStaresAt You should give nectar before you talk most of the time. Sometimes an NPC will leave once you talk to them, but only some of em just a good habit.
[1:22:49] <rbakervv> @Klarrann3 he has to be given the codex first
[1:22:50] <@SoFarFetched> @ShinobiPhoenix Yeah usually a notification at the bottom shows up just saying " ----- has donated $-.--"
[1:22:56] <@SoFarFetched> on the OBS layout
[1:22:59] <Vashido22> SourPls
[1:23:02] <k_af> That voice Kreygasm
[1:23:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> Shaaddup Meg. Go tell Heracles he's a biyatch
[1:23:07] <LordOfThePoultry> SourPls
[1:23:18] <otakon17> so what DOES Weak do?
[1:23:22] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[1:23:23] <otakon17> reduce the damage they do?
[1:23:29] <Klarrann3> @Klarrann3 oh, I just got here. I didn't realize he started a brand new save
[1:23:31] <Vashido22> yeah
[1:23:35] <AoiRob> lower enemy atk
[1:23:35] <Aydarkzero> pretty cool
[1:23:39] <fluffyprinceralsei> @otakon17 yep
[1:23:42] <Vashido22> you can make it so weak also makes them take more damage, but thats another boon
[1:23:43] <Storm_Samurai> this music slaps
[1:23:44] <%Saltmeisterr> @otakon17 yes
[1:23:45] <%Monkeyweed21> Speen
[1:23:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @SoFarFetched right, I never saw that, unless it happened while I was still on the Streamlabs screen, but isn't there usually an alert sound with it and all?
[1:23:58] <Aydarkzero> aoe spells PogChamp
[1:24:08] <%Typhaeon> Yeah this is why I so often overlook the shield throw, flimsy damage output
[1:24:09] <@SoFarFetched> @ShinobiPhoenix nope no sounds are played when donations are done. Those were turned off.
[1:24:18] <@SoFarFetched> Just an animation at the bottom of the layout plays when a donation happens.
[1:24:35] <otakon17> c'mon you can do it Pat!
[1:24:44] <Klarrann3> you got this, Pat!
[1:24:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> Plz forgive her, she's a little bi-furious
[1:24:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @SoFarFetched so... it's possible I just missed it while I was on the streamlabs page?
[1:24:49] <ScreamLord> Wait, I thought Megaera was one of Heracles' wives not a Fury
[1:24:51] <Storm_Samurai> can he clutch it out?
[1:24:52] <@SoFarFetched> Possibly yes.
[1:24:59] <Aydarkzero> d e t h
[1:25:00] <%king_wragles> Greed!
[1:25:00] <otakon17> GODDAMMIT
[1:25:06] <penitentpentwitch> You can now equip the hourglass
[1:25:06] <%CrematedCube> The shield is amazing in crowds but tough 1v1
[1:25:08] <%Typhaeon> He had a shield folks
[1:25:08] <%bhp_99> f
[1:25:09] <stormhawk9891> No he can't
[1:25:10] <Storm_Samurai> good thing you can't really die
[1:25:10] <+jacintafor> she got you
[1:25:13] <LionShard> Does Pat know how the shield works?
[1:25:13] <blitzmentalist> Megara and Megaera are different characters
[1:25:14] <Klarrann3> @GarbageQueenEllie ha. nice
[1:25:15] <+ALazo> MORTIS
[1:25:17] <@SoFarFetched> Once the streamlabs donation goes through,the animation plays within like the next two seconds or so.
[1:25:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> ok, I just wanted to understand. so much of Twitch I am new to understanding
[1:25:21] <ultimatemegahero1> Cool game over screen
[1:25:26] <AoiRob> f
[1:25:27] <Aydarkzero> thats pretty cool how he comments on the boss
[1:25:27] <otakon17> and Hypnos has a crush
[1:25:32] <penitentpentwitch> Hypnos, don't hit on your sister
[1:25:37] <Freeb0rne> Literally his sister.
[1:25:38] <Ids560> Woolie was right Hypnos is chat
[1:25:38] <$personmanthingg> PET THE DOG
[1:25:41] <Esparsenior> @patstaresat holding attack in the direction of an attack blocks all the damage
[1:25:48] <+braziliansunshine> @patstaresat you can hold the attack button with shield to block the projectiles
[1:25:51] <ShichiNoBushi> Simp.
[1:25:55] <@SoFarFetched> @ShinobiPhoenix Yeah some twitch streamers keep the donation sounds,others don't. Each streamer handles donations/messages differently.
[1:25:57] <%Monkeyweed21> pet dog
[1:25:59] <%Typhaeon> He's such a passive-aggressive dick, I love it
[1:26:02] <wibbwobbler> awww
[1:26:02] <%SWFanatic> tsk tsk tsk, the shreds you say
[1:26:05] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "Yes"
[1:26:07] <%TheWinged7> PET THAT DOGGO

[1:26:20] <JaseAdrift> ITS YOUR DOG TOO DAD
[1:26:21] <rufus2k2> yeah shitkid I'm blaming YOU
[1:26:25] <Aydarkzero> Parents am i right? Kappa
[1:26:25] <%weissguard> The Chad Hades, I see.
[1:26:28] <+michingmallecho> Hades is such a dad
[1:26:35] <otakon17> Triple Pupper
[1:26:40] <%angel949> Best pupper
[1:26:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Spot is a good boi
[1:26:45] <AoiRob> he's such a cunt
[1:26:46] <%42nfl19> Why does Zag's voice sound so familiar?
[1:26:46] <s1rcuit> LOOK AND THE EVIL THIRD HEAD
[1:26:46] <rufus2k2> Chades
[1:26:55] <stabbityrabbit> God I love Hades' depiction in this game. He's not evil, he's just a bitter asshole.
[1:26:56] <AMaidIndeed> Spot is best boi
[1:27:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> ooooooh Brad Pitt Achilles~!
[1:27:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> have sex with Achilles, Zag is PANsexual
[1:27:03] <%MechArch> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:27:05] <+Double_Tap_That> Pet the dog!
[1:27:12] <%Monkeyweed21> DRINK IT
[1:27:24] <%Typhaeon> Every lazy depiction of Hades as a bad guy in popular media is dead wrong
[1:27:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @stabbityrabbit no of the Gods are evil, just amoral
[1:27:36] <%Calek> @stabbityrabbit if I was hades in this game I would be too
[1:27:37] <Vashido22> She does
[1:27:40] <Funky_Honkey> would you guys believe it if I told you I somehow managed to get the very last RTX3080 card in stock in my country?
[1:27:42] <%angel949> Nyx is Morally Gray
[1:27:45] <otakon17> Hades was ALWAYS a bitter asshole, he got fooled into ruling the dead while his brothers got you know, ALL creation and the oceans.
[1:27:47] <Aydarkzero> @Typhaeon wasn't Hades like a huge nerd?
[1:27:47] <Storm_Samurai> Yo they updated Nyx look damn
[1:27:48] <rufus2k2> ayyyyyyy
[1:27:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> Nyx is morally GAY
[1:28:01] <rufus2k2> Athena the jock and Nyx the goth huh
[1:28:04] <$VintageSpiffy> Why is everyone so hot in this game?!
[1:28:06] <%angel949> heyyoooo
[1:28:08] <%bhp_99> I'm gonna buy the game rn
[1:28:09] <Psyramics> Nyx is the Night and Artemis is the Moon
[1:28:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Hades is quite whatever and bitter, but he's not evil, just busy and tired and hates he's in the dark while his brothers get to be in the sunlight
[1:28:26] <%Typhaeon> @Aydarkzero Resentful that Poseidon got control over the seas instead of him, more of a grudging bureaucrat
[1:28:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> like what does Zeus's lazy ass actually do
[1:28:40] <AoiRob> @ShinobiPhoenix still an arse of a dad tho
[1:28:43] <Aydarkzero> @Typhaeon makes sense
[1:28:43] <otakon17> No spear for
[1:28:50] <ScreamLord> I wonder how high up Sleep is on the totem pole?
[1:28:51] <+pectusumbra> It's also worth noting that in myth in general has Hades being fairly chill
[1:28:58] <%Monkeyweed21> Are darkness drops technically Mommy's Milkies?
[1:29:02] <%CrematedCube> The Greeks didn't like Hades because he was evil, but instead that he was unyielding and couldn't be bargained with
[1:29:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ShinobiPhoenix he's busy and his son is making a mess of things
[1:29:20] <%Typhaeon> Pretty tame in his fucking with mortals compared to his family, just that one time
[1:29:20] <otakon17> Hades is generally the chillest of the Gods due to his station and workload
[1:29:23] <%Calek> if I'm not mistaken Hades is pretty chill but his wife is the one you have to watch out for
[1:29:23] <rufus2k2> athena's tiny owl is cute
[1:29:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hades is probably the most reasonable Olympian
[1:29:27] <rufus2k2> an Owlette
[1:29:33] <otakon17> that's Bubo!
[1:29:36] <tattleworm> it's absurd how much conditional dialogue is in this game
[1:29:40] <otakon17> the wisest of Owls
[1:29:40] <Vashido22> hades literally just vibes
[1:29:53] <%the22cstomp> hades only does his job, he isnt evil
[1:29:56] <rufus2k2> @otakon17 and the most adorable
[1:29:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I mean he did still KIDNAP Persephone, but yeah
[1:30:08] <Ids560> deflect on special with bow is funny
[1:30:11] <otakon17> yes and the most adorable
[1:30:17] <Morbidmort> Hades is also the only Olympian who never tried to rape a mortal or force himself on another god
[1:30:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's not like Zeus hasn't kidnapped half a million people
[1:30:21] <%the22cstomp> yeah but in the setting of greek mythology, that's like pinching someone
[1:30:30] <otakon17> you know what those arrows need? Ricochet
[1:30:31] <stabbityrabbit> I mean, Hades in the myths is actually a better person than shown here. Never abused his son unlike this depiction. It's neat to see a different deiction than normal.
[1:30:31] <Make_me_mad> Every one of the greek gods is an asshole. Even Hades kidnapped his wife. The fact that even with that in mind Hades is still probably the nicest of the gods says a lot about them.
[1:30:32] <Klarrann3> For better results, you want to almost always try to do a dash attack
[1:30:32] <%the22cstomp> what hades did was super light
[1:30:35] <%Calek> he only kidnaps her in some interpretations, there's others where she is very willing
[1:30:39] <Klarrann3> with the bow, I mean
[1:30:40] <%Daniel_Is_I> In some myths didn't Hades not actually kidnap Persephone but rather took her away as part of a deal?
[1:30:40] <GarbageQueenEllie> In one version of the story, Persephone stages the kidnapping to get away from her bitch mom and becomes a Trap Queen
[1:30:43] <+pectusumbra> @ShinobiPhoenix It's up for debate on whether he kidnapped her or if that's just the story but Perspheone was just into him
[1:30:47] <%RedMageRebel> man I really want this but probably gonna wait for a holiday sale
[1:30:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Morbidmort I think Persephone might have something to say about that...
[1:31:01] <therealtacopancakes> do you get something extra if you have all boons from the same god?
[1:31:02] <Vashido22> its on sale tho
[1:31:04] <%Monkeyweed21> Persephone is cool, it's just her mom is a bitch
[1:31:04] <Vashido22> 20%
[1:31:08] <%CrematedCube> Brb, gotta check on the cat real quick
[1:31:10] <%Typhaeon> Despite the whole kidnapping thing he never overtly mistreats Persephone
[1:31:10] <%Monkeyweed21> @RedMageRebel its on sale
[1:31:14] <%RedMageRebel> oh shit
[1:31:17] <%RedMageRebel> didnt know that
[1:31:18] <%RedMageRebel> WELP
[1:31:21] <otakon17> I think there's a syngery bonus if you have boons from all the same god
[1:31:30] <+Promessa_EX> at this point a holiday sale would be like 25% vs 20% now
[1:31:31] <@SoFarFetched> yeah like 20% off I think for it?
[1:31:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and I don't think Hades is abusing his son here either
[1:31:37] <+michingmallecho> Zeus made Hades into a cuckold, Zeus transformed himself into hades and well you know
[1:31:44] <mellorolo> get those astrology crystals!
[1:31:44] <penitentpentwitch> @therealtacopancakes Certain boons are only available if you have boons from that god. Legendary boons generally require 3 boons from that god to unlock.
[1:31:46] <Vashido22> 20% on both steam and switch
[1:31:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Hades is just telling him NOT go to through hell
[1:31:54] <ScreamLord> @ShinobiPhoenix that was a fairly common practice in Ancient Greece. But at least Hades actually wanted to be ina long term relationship, unlike Zeus. And depending on the version of the myth you like most Hades and Persephone even have a healthy relationship
[1:31:57] <+pectusumbra> @therealtacopancakes there are tiers of boons, basically, so the more you have the better boons you can get
[1:31:58] <Morbidmort> @ShinobiPhoenix He never forced himself on her. He romanced her after tricking her into coming around on a semi-regular basis
[1:31:58] <+peanutbutterdemise> peanutbutterdemise subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:32:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> he's also not stopping him
[1:32:06] <+pectusumbra> Poms are a lot better these days though
[1:32:07] <1MadLadd> im rich biatch
[1:32:09] <rufus2k2> lol interest rates
[1:32:10] <+Promessa_EX> is the framerate okay on switch?
[1:32:11] <otakon17> HEY you gave Charon a gift maybe you'll get a discount?
[1:32:15] <%Monkeyweed21> spent too much on Ps5's and graphics cards
[1:32:16] <%Daniel_Is_I> I haven't played since the update where they gave Nyx her sprite. Did they add dual boons for every combo?
[1:32:31] <+pectusumbra> Yes
[1:32:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> the power within (x24)
[1:32:36] <Daxalog> Windbags in hell
[1:32:39] <%Saltmeisterr> @Daniel_Is_I yes
[1:32:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's hell itself that's attacking Zag, Hades isn't sending these guys to get in his way
[1:32:52] <%Daniel_Is_I> Sweet
[1:32:56] <stabbityrabbit> @ShinobiPhoenix He's the one who set the shades upon Zag. He also belittles Zagreus every chance he can. I'd qualify that as abuse.
[1:32:57] <otakon17> damn
[1:33:03] <%neroforte177> are literally half the greek myth Zuez fucking somebody/thing he shouldn't have?
[1:33:19] <+Keiyum> oh shit pat's doin roguelikes, is bpm on the list?
[1:33:20] <OperatorJo_> yes?
[1:33:23] <+queaks> gems
[1:33:23] <Klarrann3> you almost always want to get gems whenever possible
[1:33:29] <otakon17> trading Gold for Gems doesn't seem like a bad idea
[1:33:29] <%Arxel1> @neroforte177 70%
[1:33:40] <%Calek> right now keys are blocking my progression
[1:33:40] <@SoFarFetched> Don't think pat will play BPM since he thinks it looks dumb.
[1:33:43] <otakon17> anyway have fun I need to head to the doctors, toodles
[1:33:46] <%Saltmeisterr> bpm is a roguelike?
[1:33:51] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt its weird to know that THIS is the game now. No more updates or anything, after playing so much early access its a weird feeling
[1:33:57] <+Keiyum> absolutely is
[1:34:00] <%blastyoboots> @neroforte177: Greek mythology in five words: "Unfortunately, Zeus was feeling horny."
[1:34:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> Could someone summarize what makes a roguelike for a basic bitch like me to understand?
[1:34:05] <+lordericter> MIDBOSS
[1:34:07] <%JD_Lars> Are there permanent health upgrades?
[1:34:08] <penitentpentwitch> Miniboss found!
[1:34:08] <+lordericter> heck yeah
[1:34:12] <%Daniel_Is_I> Oh this one is new
[1:34:12] <%Typhaeon> I don't remember this sprite
[1:34:17] <Vashido22> @JD_Lars yes
[1:34:20] <reonome> oooh that thing is new
[1:34:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @stabbityrabbit because Zag is rather defiant and he's a parent who is tired of his son smarting off on him. He still cares and loves him
[1:34:23] <Vashido22> not a lot, but there are
[1:34:31] <Vashido22> its from the last update
[1:34:32] <+lordericter> Doomstone here to end pat's career
[1:34:33] <%Typhaeon> This looks a little overhelming
[1:34:37] <LordOfThePoultry> F
[1:34:39] <@Mechz71> @PatStaresAt how your temp buffs lookin'
[1:34:43] <%Tearonex> i've never died to that boss LUL
[1:34:45] <otakon17> well THAT was close
[1:34:48] <%kyh9> BAKA
[1:34:51] <+conradical> did pat start from zero?
[1:34:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I know WAY too many parents who are like that with their kids
[1:34:51] <%weissguard> B-baka
[1:34:52] <+Aeriqui> just can't let him get started
[1:34:54] <%kyh9> YOU BETTER APPRECIATE THIS, BAKA DEUS
[1:34:57] <%Saltmeisterr> cast it up
[1:34:57] <penitentpentwitch> Oh la la
[1:34:57] <%the22cstomp> hades is a sarcastic dad and zagreus fires back in kind for every remark hades does
[1:34:58] <@absolute_weapon> Don't forget to use the Bow Special when dealing with crowds
[1:34:59] <%Daniel_Is_I> 1
[1:35:06] <rufus2k2> Artemis thighs ifcWow
[1:35:06] <+pectusumbra> True shot is super good though
[1:35:08] <%the22cstomp> they're just riffing on each other
[1:35:13] <WanderingSwordsman> Way to scum it out
[1:35:24] <AFlyingTaco1> @GarbageQueenEllie Roguelikes have procedurally generated levels, and if you die, you start over from square one. Roguelites also have procedurally generated levels, but you usually get to keep something after death.
[1:35:40] <mellorolo> wooo
[1:35:49] <s1rcuit> what's interesting about the fountain room is that you can't leave until you use it
[1:35:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if Zag was just doing his hell job, Hades would give him less shit. Probably wanted Zag to replace him so he could retire, now he's stuck doing this job
[1:35:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> @AFlyingTaco1 I see. Thank you.
[1:36:07] <@SSaryn> Bow Special pairs pretty well with Zeus as well
[1:36:10] <%Typhaeon> Love getting boons for a shotgun bow build
[1:36:37] <@absolute_weapon> Boy does it SSaryn
[1:36:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Hades and Super Mario 3D are both out on Switch now and my Switch is still in for repairs, that's my life...
[1:37:00] <otakon17> key?
[1:37:09] <%Saltmeisterr> zeus with Luci is fire
[1:37:11] <%Laecerelius> I mean he has meat arms
[1:37:14] <reonome> only his face is a skeleton
[1:37:15] <tattleworm> this skeleton vapes
[1:37:15] <%Ne1son> Thats a zombie not a skeleton
[1:37:22] <+pectusumbra> To be fair he's hard to see and has flesh arms
[1:37:23] <+Snorlax321> too much flesh
[1:37:24] <otakon17> go with key and food!
[1:37:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> OOOO, so that's the complete Chiron design., I haven't seen it. He had a placeholder before
[1:37:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> He's a Skeletor
[1:37:33] <wibbwobbler> peach is saliva
[1:37:42] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt She's not your cousin she's your Grandpa's penis
[1:37:47] <LordOfThePoultry> you fool!
[1:37:47] <reonome> Kreygasm
[1:37:50] <Klarrann3> This time for sure
[1:37:55] <%walternatorz> ??
[1:37:56] <+conradical> always hot cousin
[1:37:56] <rufus2k2> Maybe it will~
[1:37:57] <%Typhaeon> That's correct
[1:38:01] <%Saltmeisterr> its true!
[1:38:02] <sanslogic> horny
[1:38:05] <penitentpentwitch> Aphrodite? Yeah.
[1:38:07] <%Jeemukun> balls, but yes
[1:38:08] <stormhawk9891> @wibbwobbler Saliva is you?
[1:38:08] <%luftraumm1> actually the balls
[1:38:08] <+Tyonidus> WHAT atpSpiner atpSpiner atpSpiner
[1:38:09] <%Chimeraelite> top vs power bottom
[1:38:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> Artemis is top-tier, but she's not into relationships. Last time she tried that, it ended poorly.
[1:38:12] <artificiallynatural> she was born from Kronos's ball juice hitting the sea
[1:38:12] <Manwad> hot
[1:38:13] <stabbityrabbit> @ShinobiPhoenix I'm just going to agree to disagree with you. You and I seem to have different standards for abuse.
[1:38:14] <+FlubbedPig> Isn't that Venus, not Aphrodite?
[1:38:14] <+FoolsArcade> @PatStaresAt Aphrodite is Zags AUNT
[1:38:15] <Morbidmort> *Great-Grandpa's penis
[1:38:15] <Yrefe> Oh right
[1:38:18] <KaiserMario> That's right, penis and balls and some sea foam
[1:38:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Testes, but yeah
[1:38:21] <raikagelord1> It’s true
[1:38:22] <OperatorJo_> Oh Greece
[1:38:22] <TheAdMerlin> She's not your grampa's penis, she's foam from your grampa's left testical
[1:38:22] <arkv01> well ok but I'm still horny
[1:38:24] <%Piemen99> yo the greek gods are wild
[1:38:25] <+braziliansunshine> meg's voice is atpGasm
[1:38:26] <Yrefe> greek mythology sure is horny
[1:38:34] <%AncelDeLambert> this is me going bow and arrow in Mon Hun
[1:38:36] <ShichiNoBushi> Uranus's dismembered penis was thrown into the ocean, and its semen turned into seafoam which formed into Aphrodite.
[1:38:37] <%WorldSoup5> what a banger
[1:38:37] <+Aeriqui> bro i know i'm late but i am realizing how HORNY this game is
[1:38:47] <raikagelord1> Though yeah it is more like Grandpa’s balls.
[1:38:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> @TheAdMerlin "I'd give my left nut for a night with her, eh?"
[1:38:58] <%CrematedCube> Imagine a mythos woven out of fanfics, it explains a lot that way
[1:39:00] <%Chimeraelite> It involves the Greek Gods. It's a prerequisite
[1:39:09] <stabbityrabbit> This game is beautifully horny. Like a true modernization of greek myth.
[1:39:09] <Morbidmort> Uranus was father of the Titans, not the Olympians guys
[1:39:10] <%AncelDeLambert> wait, why is Megaera a Fury? I thought she was an oracle?
[1:39:13] <Morbidmort> So Great-Aunt
[1:39:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @stabbityrabbit different upbringing, different generations. I've definitely seen real abuse
[1:39:14] <%Tearonex> it's kinda bugging me pat's not using the special attack more
[1:39:26] <arkv01> greeks WHY WERE YOU HORNY
[1:39:29] <otakon17> noicely done
[1:39:33] <%RedMageRebel> I still need to play transistor, I loved Bastion
[1:39:33] <rufus2k2> Awww :(
[1:39:37] <%Monkeyweed21> Furry defeat
[1:39:38] <%ssjklyco> Meg sure like to call for help from mobs depsite talking about how good she is.
[1:39:44] <tales_911> Listen to this music by Tool
[1:39:58] <wibbwobbler> psaUp
[1:39:59] <spacecatstreams> i can't decide whether I want to start a new save or not
[1:40:06] <@SSaryn> WOW
[1:40:06] <@SSaryn> OK
[1:40:14] <@commanderclaw> Centaur Souls is the Grecian Dark Souls
[1:40:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> the overall design of this is really cool.
[1:40:15] <%za7az> Hey, just got here. Has Pat beat REDACTED yet?
[1:40:15] <@SSaryn> Centaur Soul pretty fucking ok
[1:40:15] <Aydarkzero> working out well
[1:40:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> If I had to choose between Hades or my mother, I'll take Hades...
[1:40:18] <rufus2k2> oh that map is slick
[1:40:20] <+michingmallecho> I have transistor from ps plus, I never touched it. I don’t know why
[1:40:22] <tales_911> That is such a Dope map
[1:40:25] <rufus2k2> great transition
[1:40:26] <%walternatorz> all those levels of BRD have paid off
[1:40:31] <+Aeriqui> i started a new save on switch and continuing my old save and getting BOPPED by Hades
[1:40:35] <%Saltmeisterr> @ssjklyco yeah i was always weirded out by that
[1:40:39] <%Daniel_Is_I> Okay Centaur Souls were not in when I played
[1:40:49] <%king_wragles> Who was that joke FOR?
[1:40:50] <+Aeriqui> bro Hades phase 2 has been kicking my ass for months
[1:40:50] <%SWFanatic> #Lit
[1:40:52] <%Arxel1> haHAA
[1:40:58] <ScreamLord> "Dry Heat" just means you burn instead of steam
[1:40:59] <%misha_kastrilevich> Where is the voice coming from?
[1:41:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Aeriqui I thought PC/Switch cross saving wasn't available at launch?
[1:41:15] <%CrematedCube> They were centuar hearts back in ma' day
[1:41:20] <DrFacilier> So is the 3080 the only one available right now? is the 3070 coming later?
[1:41:22] <$GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> imagine Dark Souls but everyone's a centaur
[1:41:40] <%Saltmeisterr> @ShinobiPhoenix yeah its not
[1:41:41] <+FlubbedPig> @PatStaresAt Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, Demeter and Hestia are your aunts and uncles. Your cousins are Dionysus, Hermes, Hephaestus, Apollo, Ares, Athena, Artemis, Aphrodite.
[1:41:43] <otakon17> Hammer!
[1:41:44] <Klarrann3> hammer every time
[1:41:46] <+Aeriqui> @ShinobiPhoenix its not, which is why i'm doing 2 separate saves
[1:41:47] <count_bob> Tough choice actually.
[1:41:47] <Bigyanno> always hammer
[1:41:49] <Klarrann3> never not the hammer
[1:41:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @DrFacilier pretty sure no one has gotten a 3080 thanks to Scalpers
[1:41:52] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Always hammer
[1:41:52] <tattleworm> never not hammer
[1:41:54] <%waltzqueen> BEST TRACK TIME
[1:41:54] <penitentpentwitch> Hermes good! Side hustle is great the sooner you get it.
[1:41:57] <count_bob> Hermes gives you more dashes.
[1:41:58] <watts121> hope for twin shot
[1:42:30] <%Ranryu692> it's why Divine Dash is the best dash move
[1:42:36] <penitentpentwitch> Hermes can give you the Nier Automata dodge animation
[1:42:41] <DrFacilier> @ShinobiPhoenix ah fuck
[1:42:42] <%Saltmeisterr> 3
[1:42:42] <watts121> Point blank
[1:42:46] <%Saltmeisterr> snipe it up
[1:42:47] <otakon17> Go Sniper!
[1:42:50] <LordOfThePoultry> 3
[1:42:53] <televisedrevolting> This bass is fucking hot.
[1:42:55] <@SSaryn> All pretty good
[1:42:56] <Klarrann3> you ALWAYS want to get hammer
[1:42:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Neat
[1:43:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> STOP. Hammatiem
[1:43:09] <%Typhaeon> All-rounder at this point
[1:43:10] <watts121> you just turned the slowest weapon even slower
[1:43:12] <%Saltmeisterr> DOUBLE
[1:43:15] <Bigyanno> those were some basic ass options
[1:43:17] <+lordericter> oh no
[1:43:18] <OperatorJo_> This a good bass
[1:43:21] <%RedMageRebel> thats a really good baseline damn
[1:43:23] <+pectusumbra> Trial of the gods
[1:43:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @DrFacilier Pat was already pissed about it on twitter and several of my friends are very upset...
[1:43:25] <penitentpentwitch> It's time to mediate a family argument! ...that you start.
[1:43:28] <reonome> uh oh
[1:43:33] <spacecatstreams> is it wrong to flirt with artemis? she's my cousin but she's so cute
[1:43:35] <LordOfThePoultry> rip this run
[1:43:39] <stabbityrabbit> Oof. Wrong choice Pat.
[1:43:39] <penitentpentwitch> Holy Shield is I-frames!
[1:43:45] <%Daniel_Is_I> ATREMIS UPSET
[1:43:49] <%Daniel_Is_I> Artemis*
[1:43:51] <+lordericter> oh artemis enemies are not fun
[1:43:51] <+EmptyPenguin> but the revive T.T
[1:43:55] <KaiserMario> SHUT UP VIRGIN
[1:43:55] <@Mechz71> HAD TO DO IT TO EM
[1:43:56] <%Arxel1> He had to do it to em
[1:43:57] <%angel949> Artemis is so hot
[1:43:58] <spacecatstreams> it's fine he's fine guys
[1:44:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I'm mad for everyone who couldn't get a 3080 due to scalpers and bots
[1:44:08] <reonome> athena enemies are worse so its fine lol
[1:44:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> D'awww. She's showing her baby cousin how to shoot.
[1:44:17] <otakon17> Artemis Yamete!
[1:44:27] <%Typhaeon> Pat engages BLM mode and stands in all the puddles
[1:44:28] <%Ne1son> Get off the little island
[1:44:29] <wibbwobbler> k
[1:44:32] <+FlubbedPig> @PatStaresAt Weirder part about Dionysus is that he actually replaces Hestia (goddess of warmth and fire) in the pantheon. Greeks chose alcohol over fire.
[1:44:33] <LordOfThePoultry> use the special
[1:44:36] <+Jaysky> Artemis is cute though so forgive her
[1:44:38] <VritraReiRei> why fight on the tiny island LUL
[1:44:39] <%misha_kastrilevich> Wait, is that what happens when you choose a different upgrade?
[1:44:40] <Bigyanno> Artemis is the worse in small areas
[1:44:41] <%misha_kastrilevich> Fucking sick!
[1:44:46] <reonome> F
[1:44:47] <watts121> damn they buffed Aretmis' trial
[1:44:51] <%misha_kastrilevich> It really shows how petty the gods are
[1:44:52] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Pat's finally playing touhou
[1:44:52] <PatchySouls> WOAH
[1:44:53] <otakon17> ...next time pick Artemis
[1:44:54] <rufus2k2> Washed
[1:44:54] <%Monkeyweed21> bitch
[1:44:54] <penitentpentwitch> Snark!
[1:44:57] <blitzmentalist> vineMortis
[1:44:57] <@SSaryn> Just be gud ez Kappa
[1:44:58] <%Chimeraelite> Yes ma'am
[1:44:59] <GodGoshDarnIt> NO MR SIMPSON NO
[1:45:00] <PatchySouls> Either that's new or I never died to a god in a trial
[1:45:01] <rufus2k2> You got hunted by the huntress
[1:45:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> Yeahhhh never go against Artemis
[1:45:03] <OperatorJo_> F
[1:45:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> Arti has no chill
[1:45:06] <PatchySouls> WOW THAT'S SO COOL
[1:45:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the bow just made that harder than it would have been. no space to move
[1:45:09] <tattleworm> oh, i've never seen them trash talk before, that's dope
[1:45:10] <lucas18293> those rooms are real rough lmao
[1:45:11] <LordOfThePoultry> yes ma'am
[1:45:15] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Goin' for an angry pee
[1:45:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it was jsut bad luck
[1:45:16] <+lordericter> Artemis is one of 2 gods you don't want to piss off
[1:45:17] <JaseAdrift> Shouldnt have pissed off Artemis
[1:45:19] <+EmptyPenguin> Yeah I remember Arte being one of the harder one's to go against
[1:45:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> Tags: cute family bonding, major character death, NTR
[1:45:20] <VritraReiRei> @PatchySouls its been changed
[1:45:28] <%fairore> wow its like that
[1:45:31] <penitentpentwitch> Like a victory scene from a fighting game round
[1:45:33] <1MadLadd> "i am here for you ok?" also artemis: " i'll shoot you dead"
[1:45:36] <+braziliansunshine> pro tip: always pick not athena. all she does is give enemies shield
[1:45:50] <stabbityrabbit> The only god harder than Artemis is (SPOILERS). Any small space with that one is a bitch.
[1:45:50] <+Jaysky> Don't get her upset tho
[1:45:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @lordericter who's the other? are you only talking about in this game?
[1:45:56] <dinnydanny777> So when do we fight James Woods?
[1:46:10] <dinnydanny777> I assume that's what this game is about
[1:46:34] <+AnthraxJohnson> Anyone know the song name?
[1:46:45] <%Saltmeisterr> @ShinobiPhoenix i would assume athena?
[1:46:49] <+lordericter> @lordericter yeah the other is Aphrodite and yeah just for Hades
[1:46:59] <%YakumoYomi> @dinnydanny777 "Feel the heat!"

[1:47:45] <Ell1ot> peeing on your hands doesn't count as washing your hands
[1:47:46] <PanicSwytch> You need your prostate and your colon checked

[1:48:53] <%RedMageRebel> the character art is so endearing, wow
[1:48:54] <%BinaryFireball> so is Pat gonna sell 2 ps5s to buy a marked up 3080?
[1:48:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> Fictional Contractors make the BIGGEST Bank
[1:49:01] <%LouieRouie> You have ALL THE JEWELS Hades!
[1:49:01] <%emperordread> Well THERE'S your problem chief, got god juice flowing behind this load bearing pillar
[1:49:02] <%YakumoYomi> Korone's "English only" Super Mario Bros. stream is a treasure. Everyone should go see it
[1:49:06] <Meekest> Fucking Hell unions
[1:49:10] <$Aitch971> good ole defias. Defias best contractors
[1:49:12] <%kyh9> The best part of Hades in this game is that the main reason Nyx welcomed him is because he's SO DAMN GOOD AT LOGISTICS and sorted out the chaos of the Underworld
[1:49:16] <%Laecerelius> Seems ya got a displacer beast infestation! That'll cost extra.

[1:51:10] <%kyh9> @RedMageRebel She sounds like she works in Fashion
[1:51:12] <%DakotaMacDoodle> @PatStaresAt The Curse was Ligma
[1:51:14] <LoneFonte> no minus
[1:51:16] <@SoFarFetched> nope
[1:51:23] <%Ranryu692> eventually you can respec for a key
[1:51:24] <%misha_kastrilevich> Supergiant games better release a plush of Cerberus
[1:51:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @LandOfTheWay Started over for 1.0, not too far in
[1:51:25] <+FlubbedPig> Resetting the mirror now costs keys
[1:51:26] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Steve Jobs
[1:51:26] <@Mechz71> What's ligma
[1:51:26] <%kyh9> LCK MY BALLS

[1:51:29] <%kyh9> HAHAHA
[1:51:32] <%kyh9> AHAHAHAHAHHA
[1:51:37] <stabbityrabbit> @PatStaresAt It now costs one key to reset your darkness. Which sucks, but whatever.
[1:51:38] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt I think you unlock key-to-reset later with the mirror
[1:51:39] <%GohanHitsugaya> GohanHitsugaya subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hey Pat, sorry I haven't been able to catch your streams in awhile; there was a serious chance my family and I were going to be homeless, luckily our landlord offered us a deal to move into one of the homes he was keeping; for less than what it's worth.
[1:51:40] <TioXyco> @Mechz71 LIGMA BALLS

[1:52:11] <%kyh9> free dosh
[1:52:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> Paige loves coinpurse too
[1:52:18] <+pectusumbra> it's a good one
[1:52:20] <%BubbaRands> thword
[1:52:20] <T_Sasquatch> Spear is best
[1:52:22] <reonome> coin purse is great early game
[1:52:22] <@SoFarFetched> well he's BALDING since the skeleton somehow has hair.
[1:52:22] <maverickdrifter> I love that I can tell that’s the merchant guy from pyre
[1:52:22] <%UvBenServed> psaBougie psaBougie psaBougie
[1:52:28] <OperatorJo_> someone in chat got got NotLikeThis
[1:52:30] <dinnydanny777> Coin purse is also a word for something else :)
[1:52:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> huuruahgah
[1:52:32] <%blastyoboots> old special animation was just a floating T-pose to intimidate

[1:52:35] <%Saltmeisterr> CRUSTY UNCLE
[1:52:36] <%waltzqueen> with what lips tho
[1:52:38] <scrumbotime> then when you get the ability to swap between floors, you take the free cash at the start, then swap out to an actual buff later
[1:52:41] <%kujofire990> BROSIDEON
[1:52:48] <%Agami23> i love the poseidon buffs
[1:52:52] <%Ranryu692> his hair is so cool
[1:52:53] <$realm_forge> No teeth this time bro
[1:52:55] <benjiFG> hoy
[1:52:59] <Make_me_mad> Poseiden is a fuckin' dirtbag.
[1:52:59] <%UvBenServed> King of the Brocean
[1:53:00] <+lordericter> Just steal from Charon Pat Spelunky taught me paying shopkeepers is for nerds
[1:53:00] <+Pinkiefan> What's the death mechanic in this game?
[1:53:02] <dinnydanny777> Poseidon is just constantly wet :)
[1:53:02] <%Tearonex> DASH
[1:53:02] <reonome> stinky seaweed uncle
[1:53:04] <%weissguard> Broseidon, eh.
[1:53:05] <%Saltmeisterr> Special
[1:53:07] <+paladinstarbuster> OPPA
[1:53:08] <VritraReiRei> Dash
[1:53:09] <%RedMageRebel> Posiedon and Artemis were always my faves as a kid
[1:53:10] <%Agami23> the dash is real good
[1:53:13] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Stir things up a bit to cover your nuts Kreygasm
[1:53:14] <%linSP> number go up
[1:53:15] <penitentpentwitch> Cast or special are decent
[1:53:15] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt DASH IS BROKEN
[1:53:16] <dinnydanny777> King of being wet :)
[1:53:17] <agrael50> poseidon is better whit the shield
[1:53:18] <LordOfThePoultry> special
[1:53:18] <+Jaysky> Zeus is the dirtbag
[1:53:19] <+pectusumbra> flood shot is basically a grenade
[1:53:21] <%WorldSoup5> D A S H
[1:53:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> Broseidon must be great at parties
[1:53:25] <wibbwobbler> PogChamp
[1:53:29] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Very good
[1:53:32] <blitzmentalist> Splish Splash I was taken a bath
[1:53:35] <%Ranryu692> Poseidon boons hit hard
[1:53:40] <CrystalLightPeachTea> It is poseidon, makes sense
[1:53:42] <+FlubbedPig> Heavy damage for knocking enemies into terrain
[1:53:47] <dinnydanny777> Poseidon is kind of a shit too if I recall correctly
[1:53:50] <rafaelba93> this one is VERY strong
[1:53:51] <s1rcuit> pretty sure it also ups the dmg from hitting walls
[1:53:52] <tattleworm> special would've been decent on the sword but dash is good
[1:53:53] <%Agami23> the dash smacking enemies into walls is HUGE
[1:53:53] <%SovPho> I didn't really like Transistor or Bastion because I have shitty taste, would I like this game instead?
[1:54:00] <rafaelba93> can be your main weapon
[1:54:03] <CrystalLightPeachTea> DOUBLE UP
[1:54:05] <+amurter19> I dont like weaken
[1:54:07] <%Arxel1> BROseiden
[1:54:11] <Morbidmort> He really wants to be the favorite uncle
[1:54:16] <reonome> @SovPho it plays a lot better so maybe?
[1:54:17] <%Tearonex> Posiden's dash turns your dash into a weapon
[1:54:18] <+LandOfTheWay> @SovPho depends, do you like rogue-likes?
[1:54:29] <%Saltmeisterr> ew no
[1:54:30] <%Ghetto_Sithlord> Hmmm
[1:54:32] <GarbageQueenEllie> Is there a chain weapon in this game? That'd be hella dope. Like some kinda fish hook getup
[1:54:32] <+Jaysky> @SovPho Do you like roguelikes and difficulty? Do you like the art and the way the gameplay looks rn? If so then yeah prob.
[1:54:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SovPho its bastion gameplay in rougue lite form
[1:54:44] <stabbityrabbit> @SovPho Maybe, it's like a better faster version of Bastion.
[1:54:45] <%Saltmeisterr> u never want poseidon attack on sword
[1:54:45] <+braziliansunshine> @sovpho i didn't like those either but i love this game
[1:54:48] <+dmtjinni> Did Pat talk about playing MGS again since early sep?
[1:54:49] <%SovPho> Thoroughly as long as they don't overpursue difficulty
[1:54:56] <dinnydanny777> Poseidon is the Ocean Man :)
[1:55:03] <+Jaysky> Btw did Pat talk about that new Monster Hunter at all?
[1:55:10] <+FlubbedPig> Razor Shoals would be very nice for this build
[1:55:16] <rafaelba93> get that with 5 dashes, never use your weapons again
[1:55:26] <CrystalLightPeachTea> But, if you save up for 1 more key, you can expand your mirror!
[1:55:27] <%Ranryu692> today's update added 3000 voice lines
[1:55:30] <+LandOfTheWay> oh yeah, since i just got here, did pat mention whether he'd still play pyre?
[1:55:30] <+Jaysky> There's tons ye it's nice
[1:55:30] <%Ghetto_Sithlord> Hmmm
[1:55:31] <lucas18293> @patstaresat I have 800 hours in this game and I'm still running into new dialogue
[1:55:32] <penitentpentwitch> They worked their voice actors to the bone
[1:55:40] <$realm_forge> Is this on PlayStation?
[1:55:42] <penitentpentwitch> Yet not in a bad way
[1:55:46] <%RedMageRebel> i like how kind of dispassionate main guy is
[1:55:47] <%Ranryu692> they added 3000 new voice lines just today
[1:55:52] <LoneFonte> all these fucking specific lines
[1:55:54] <%SovPho> @stabbityrabbit That'll probably be good, then. I really didn't like the narrator format of Transistor or Bastion and this one has the PC talking so maybe that'd go better for me.
[1:55:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'll buy this game full price three times for the full Voiceover alone
[1:56:04] <%Saltmeisterr> @Ranryu692 wtf
[1:56:23] <LoneFonte> Today i got a line from Ares congratulating me for killing 1000 enemies
[1:56:27] <%AzureGale> This one's a pain
[1:56:29] <%CrematedCube> Oh this thing is new to me
[1:56:30] <KnightAsteran> thats a new dude
[1:56:30] <+AbnormalVoid> yawwwwwwww
[1:56:31] <artificiallynatural> the dashes can be really hit and miss
[1:56:31] <%Ranryu692> @Saltmeisterr this game has so much work put into it
[1:56:32] <+AbnormalVoid> das hawt
[1:56:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @GarbageQueenEllie PC, Switch, and PS/XB?
[1:56:39] <tolloponik> OOOH this ones new!
[1:56:40] <VritraReiRei> @realm_forge only PC and Switch
[1:56:48] <%SovPho> Looks like it plays a lot like HLD
[1:56:51] <penitentpentwitch> Flawless!
[1:56:58] <LordOfThePoultry> SourPls
[1:56:59] <%Saltmeisterr> @Ranryu692 i know man. thats just insane
[1:57:00] <+Jaysky> Oh hey it's the shitlord
[1:57:08] <tattleworm> oh wow, knockback trivialises him
[1:57:08] <%king_wragles> You look like you're controlling Zag with the sword a lot better than with the other weapons, @PatStaresAt
[1:57:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> @ShinobiPhoenix ALL the consoles! Full voice work deserves its pay
[1:57:11] <%CrematedCube> The power of uncles
[1:57:11] <tattleworm> neat!
[1:57:14] <LoneFonte> ps4/xbo should come later
[1:57:14] <%Saltmeisterr> SEA STORM
[1:57:18] <+Turkweiss> Kinda want to start a new game now that this is in 1.0
[1:57:19] <dinnydanny777> Is Zeus gonna tell us how to become a Donkey?
[1:57:19] <+icekept> That was new
[1:57:28] <Klarrann3> you can dash right after using special to land a special at your dash location
[1:57:32] <dinnydanny777> And do creepy shit on Earth?
[1:57:36] <tattleworm> there's an amazing zeus/poseidon duo
[1:57:37] <%Agami23> just like final fantasy
[1:57:38] <%Saltmeisterr> sea storm is like my favorite duos
[1:57:38] <%SovPho> How much of a roguelike is it? Is there still a core/.linear story?
[1:57:56] <$realm_forge> I love that he gets sassy with the narrator
[1:58:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yeyeye Percy Jackson it
[1:58:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I think i prefer the Spear to the Sword
[1:58:18] <+chiazam> Did Pat start the game over from the beginning?
[1:58:20] <+Jaysky> The story is getting out of hell to reach the surface and your dad is telling you no don't or I'll kill you a bunch.
[1:58:22] <blitzmentalist> SourPls
[1:58:22] <+pectusumbra> speed test!
[1:58:22] <%Kiwami_gaim> I personally really like the shield
[1:58:29] <%RedMageRebel> god this actually makes me want to reread the percy jackson books
[1:58:35] <%luftraumm1> malphon os the best weapon bar none, but it's very hard
[1:58:35] <%RedMageRebel> I fell off after a bit but they were good
[1:58:46] <Klarrann3> @SovPho yeah, there's kind of a story
[1:58:47] <%shyguysupreme> how is the full release?
[1:58:51] <+chiazam> @RedMageRebel I already re-read them lmao
[1:58:54] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Longer you take, lesser your prize. Intriguing.
[1:58:59] <blitzmentalist> Loadsa money!
[1:59:00] <%fairore> man this ost is great
[1:59:01] <%luftraumm1> s tier excalibur a tier gilgamesh and guan yu
[1:59:16] <President_valentine> Hey Charon
[1:59:24] <%AncelDeLambert> Percy Jackson is so middle of the road, it might as well be a made for tv Disney movie
[1:59:25] <penitentpentwitch> "No. I have work ethic man."
[1:59:31] <OperatorJo_> that was a no
[1:59:32] <+Pinkiefan> So is this only on Epic store?
[1:59:33] <LoneFonte> ooooh
[1:59:33] <%Saltmeisterr> DEWIT
[1:59:34] <%AncelDeLambert> and that's just the BOOKS
[1:59:34] <tolloponik> Charon Looks Awesome Damn!
[1:59:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> just remember, Charon is a Soul Reaper
[1:59:37] <+chiazam> Charon said "no"
[1:59:38] <+pectusumbra> In the last area there are 1000+ items in the shop
[1:59:38] <%Ranryu692> I hate when they do this
[1:59:39] <%l3sovikk> I'd pass
[1:59:40] <+LandOfTheWay> yeyeye
[1:59:42] <%Saltmeisterr> TAKE IT
[1:59:43] <dirtyh4rr1> yes
[1:59:44] <LordOfThePoultry> NICE
[1:59:44] <%Ranryu692> @Pinkiefan it's on steam
[1:59:44] <%king_wragles> @Pinkiefan steam too I believe
[1:59:45] <0rond> @PatStaresAt that's not drowning, there are things that cost 1200-1500 gold
[1:59:46] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Interations, neat.
[1:59:48] <%blastyoboots> DO IT :D
[1:59:49] <penitentpentwitch> The temptation
[1:59:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Pinkiefan its now on Steam
[1:59:49] <%Arxel1> yeyeyey
[1:59:49] <+pectusumbra> up to you, but that's 1 of 2 ways to get heroic level boons
[1:59:51] <VritraReiRei> SeemsGood
[1:59:51] <LoneFonte> 20% CHANCE FOR 400 DAMAGE
[1:59:56] <%Xooler67> Xooler67 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! Wow 19 months... Woo!
[2:00:03] <%Ghetto_Sithlord> He said “I don’t do layaway”
[2:00:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> @AncelDeLambert I lost interest after the first book series ended. There's so freaking much of it now
[2:00:11] <%RedMageRebel> @AncelDeLambert I just wanna have something easy/familiar to read but LMAO to re-reading HP anymore
[2:00:12] <%CrematedCube> Those WoW colors. Blues, purples, oranges.
[2:00:20] <Klarrann3> @PatStaresAt Eurydice boons
[2:00:23] <+FlubbedPig> @PatStaresAt Are you aware of what Rarity means? Basically effects how the boon scales with Pom upgrades.
[2:00:23] <lucas18293> there's 3 ways but thd other 2 are spoilery
[2:00:28] <%Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt a demeter boon upgrades ur boons
[2:00:29] <%kknutson4> There's boons higher than heroic
[2:00:33] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt From a [SPOILER] Character
[2:00:34] <+Pinkiefan> I may get this then. Havne't played a roguelike for a while. Looks like a fun game.
[2:00:35] <penitentpentwitch> Heroic boons are simply low chance to spawn boons, LEGENDARY boons require several boons from a single god
[2:00:35] <PatchySouls> EuryDEEZ NUTS
[2:00:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> EuradeezNUTS
[2:00:36] <%king_wragles> @Pinkiefan just bought it on Steam actually, for a discount too!
[2:00:36] <%Daniel_Is_I> Yur-ih-dih-see
[2:00:38] <EternalJedi> Yur-ih-di-cee
[2:00:39] <%SirGO0SE> Eurydice nuts
[2:00:40] <+pectusumbra> In the 2nd area you can have a special interaction like with Sisyphus.
[2:00:41] <%linSP> ur a deez
[2:00:41] <dinnydanny777> Fuck yeah, now we're getting into the obscure deities
[2:00:42] <tattleworm> eu-ri-di-see
[2:00:45] <Meekest> EuraDEEZ
[2:00:46] <%waltzqueen> Wife of Orphyus

[2:00:48] <+LandOfTheWay> eur-i-de-cee
[2:00:48] <%AncelDeLambert> @RedMageRebel the Alanna series by Tamora Pierce, still good
[2:00:48] <artificiallynatural> that was the worst pronunciation I've ever heard
[2:00:49] <%neroforte177> URA DEEZ NUTZ thank you
[2:00:49] <dinnydanny777> When do we meet Deimos
[2:00:49] <%SovPho> what's the deal with airline greeks?
[2:00:50] <President_valentine> Orpheus wife
[2:00:52] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt Orpheus' Wife
[2:00:52] <%Arxel1> Eurydice is Odysseus waifu
[2:00:58] <+pectusumbra> She's the wife of Orpheus. The one he went to hades to try and get back
[2:01:02] <popcultureaficionado> we cool
[2:01:03] <%luftraumm1> euridice is orpheus's wife
[2:01:03] <The_Nightmare_Emperor> Wife of Orpheus I believe
[2:01:03] <%RedMageRebel> I got super fucking depressed years ago and ever since I've had trouble sitting down and reading, I used to read all the time. Figure if I start with what I used to like, it'll be easier to focus on new stuff
[2:01:04] <stabbityrabbit> @PatStaresAt A wood nymph. She's the second area's Sisyphus.
[2:01:04] <%kknutson4> A mirror upgrade increase chances of epic/heroic boons
[2:01:09] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Orpheus, not Odysseus
[2:01:20] <%ElkRiverDog> Chick with a flaky rock star husband, nbd...
[2:01:22] <%RedMageRebel> @AncelDeLambert ohh ill look that up
[2:01:23] <%CrematedCube> Greek is so hard to pronounce
[2:01:32] <+chiazam> YURIDACEE
[2:01:33] <+pectusumbra> there are diminishing returns on leveling with poms
[2:01:33] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Level 2 Boons?
[2:01:36] <%Agami23> orpheus morpheus go get some walruses
[2:01:37] <%SovPho> jerry seinfeld is so iconic even his shittiest jokes are quintessential
[2:01:42] <+amurter19> Hows the switch port? Assuming this is pc
[2:01:49] <dinnydanny777> Guys who is the Greek God of Sleep I forgot
[2:01:52] <Klarrann3> @PatStaresAt She's a hidden character in the lava zone
[2:01:53] <0rond> @FlubbedPig It doesn't, all qualities scale the same, the rarity only affects the starting value and sometimes a value that doesn't scale (artemis rarity will determine the crit chance but poms will upgrade the damage)
[2:01:55] <Ids560> Eurydice is sisyphus for floor 2
[2:02:00] <%SWFanatic> interior crocadlie alligator

[2:06:24] <+chiazam> The visual effects have definitely improved
[2:06:31] <%SovPho> So far this game has less overbearing narration than Transistor which is a plus

[2:09:07] <tolloponik> Wish I could watch the stream
[2:09:08] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Treuan I prefer Pizza Hut to literally any other chain pizza. Papa John is bad and I didn't want John to get more money, Domino is terrible and donates to Anti-LGBT, Donatos is cheese on a cracker
[2:09:08] <Psyramics> Pat Stares At! No Game! Just Pat!
[2:09:09] <+Pinkiefan> How would you guys say this is compared to enter the gungeon?

[2:09:46] <%blastyoboots> I have run this game SO MANY TIMES and I do NOT REMEMBER HEARING THIS MUSIC IN ASPHODEL DID THEY ADD NEW TRACKS???
[2:09:48] <+klooswep> lousy flying enemies not getting burned in lava
[2:10:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and now I have made a near $40 pizza order
[2:10:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> for myself to eat alone and watch The BOys later
[2:10:25] <@SoFarFetched> @blastyoboots yeah they added new tracks since 1.0 released today,along with a bunch of other additions and fixes.
[2:10:31] <+dmtjinni> !HEAL
[2:10:37] <SomeAsianDood> that sounds like a good time phoenix

[2:10:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @RedMageRebel I am old enough to remember when Little Caesar was a real pizza chain and not some weird insta pizza service
[2:10:52] <%CrematedCube> Dangerous greed
[2:10:55] <CrystalLightPeachTea> 10 gems pat, was it worth it?
[2:10:58] <+chiazam> gift
[2:11:01] <mellorolo> @redmagerebel little Caesars is delicious and cheap.. i suspect it helps feeds communities fairly well on those two factors alone.
[2:11:01] <%AzureGale> You just delayed your demise by one room
[2:11:03] <+Jaysky> This game looks like waaay too much to me. So many flashing lights and enemies and projectiles to keep track of
[2:11:05] <%KoiRedd> Commander Zavala??
[2:11:07] <LordOfThePoultry> big F
[2:11:08] <%SovPho> how quickly can you dodge in succession

[2:11:19] <%SWFanatic> psaDogchamp

[2:11:53] <+chiazam> On a run like that? Worth it
[2:12:00] <mellorolo> =)
[2:12:01] <%bevyrage> Remember that money is lost on death and doesn't carry over between runs. All other resources do though!
[2:12:02] <+chiazam> Oh that's not worth it
[2:12:04] <+Krando> hey Pat

[2:15:48] <%AzureGale> Hades is great because of its depiction of the underworld as a beuracracy
[2:15:50] <%chiazam> Can you look at it?
[2:15:53] <%Jeemukun> he is the god of death after all, he keeps hades in business
[2:16:13] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Can trade keys for nectar, great idea for when all weapons are unlocked.

[2:16:46] <%blastyoboots> @PatStaresAt in the changelog for 1.0 they said they made it so you can listen in to these conversations from further away so it doesn't sound/look like you're just invasively creeping straight in and theyre talking unnoticing
[2:16:55] <%CrematedCube> No-one prayed to Hades because he simply won't be bribed
[2:16:58] <%PR0swagonist> PR0swagonist subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:17:01] <Oxybe> Hades must be good friends with DBZ's king Yema. both have fine desks.
[2:17:05] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Go back, you can unlock the mirror more

[2:17:23] <JinjaBredMan> NotLikeThis
[2:17:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> spppeennn
[2:17:34] <%AzureGale> Penetrate your foes with your long pointy shaft
[2:17:37] <%RedMageRebel> the animations are so damn endearing
[2:17:39] <Louie_Salmon> Spear is probably the best feeling one
[2:17:40] <%Piemen99> what kind of magical girl bullshit was that
[2:17:41] <$realm_forge> Don’t let Paige neat that guy
[2:17:48] <%BinaryFireball> think that dude gets paid well?
[2:17:50] <SomeAsianDood> I always fine the spin attack too slow without some bonuses

[2:17:58] <Oxybe> Spear: when when you want to sword someone but they juuuuuust out of reach

[2:18:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oh, it's that guy who got stuck in a jar for like a month :)
[2:18:36] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Blade Dash sounds neat
[2:18:37] <%chiazam> DOOOOOM
[2:18:39] <dinnydanny777> Appropriate for the God of fire
[2:18:39] <%PR0swagonist> DOOM
[2:18:41] <%misha_kastrilevich> Did I just hear Kratos's scream?
[2:18:43] <%SWFanatic> DOOOOM
[2:18:44] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> they're all pretty good
[2:18:45] <%Broand> Doom is strong if you invest in it
[2:18:48] <SomeAsianDood> @ShinobiPhoenix it has an aspect with a snatch and has an uppercut cancel. IT'S AMAZING
[2:18:49] <Louie_Salmon> Doom is so good
[2:18:51] <%CrematedCube> Doom is crazy strong on the right weapons
[2:18:54] <Louie_Salmon> Just free damage
[2:18:54] <%TheWinged7> *HEAVY METAL INTENSIFIES*
[2:18:56] <Sundaysmiles01> lol
[2:18:57] <ScreamLord> It's hilarious how much shit Ares gets. Everyone but Aphrodite hates him for no particular reason lol
[2:18:59] <%GohanHitsugaya> Lol
[2:19:03] <%Saltmeisterr> AREA
[2:19:05] <+zachbat13> blade rift dash is so good

[2:19:12] <%chiazam> big damage
[2:19:26] <Sundaysmiles01> I like the escalating soundtrack
[2:19:32] <Morbidmort> Doom on the shield throw though
[2:19:39] <dinnydanny777> Is Ares here to serve the purpose he served in real Greek Myth, which is to be made into a joke when he gets beaten and humiliated by Athena?
[2:19:42] <%blastyoboots> @ScreamLord well the concept of war IS kind of dickish. but the rest of the gods are hypocrites glorifying it usually so yeah i dunno what their problem is
[2:19:44] <%SWFanatic> Flawless VIctory
[2:19:48] <%waltzqueen> @ScreamLord if Athena is military wisodm and the glory of war, Ares is the panic, pain and suffering-the loss and despair of War. look up the Overly Sarcastic Productions video about Ares' kidnapping

[2:20:41] <%waltzqueen> @CrematedCube Aphrodite is married to Haphestus not Ares
[2:20:42] <reonome> holy shield is ok once you get to bosses
[2:20:46] <President_valentine> not fan of Athena outside of her dash
[2:20:47] <%SWFanatic> Pat used [Smooch Cat]. It's super effective!
[2:20:52] <Meekest> Thats how I feel about almost all of Athena's boons
[2:20:57] <Manwad> holy shield is mercy frames
[2:21:21] <SomeAsianDood> I mean the death defiance bonus and her aid are pretty good
[2:21:26] <ScreamLord> @waltzqueen I've seen that one, lol. And that is one theory for it but the actual reason is never outright specified in any of the myths
[2:21:35] <President_valentine> Ares
[2:21:41] <+FlubbedPig> I still find it weird that Apollo, Hera and Hephaestus are missing.
[2:21:44] <Sundaysmiles01> In a weird way, this game reminds me of Legacy of Kain - Soulreaver
[2:22:01] <dinnydanny777> Is Apollo the one who holds up the Earth? I always forget
[2:22:08] <SomeAsianDood> They name drop Hera and Apollo I think
[2:22:14] <President_valentine> That's Atlas
[2:22:14] <SomeAsianDood> And say they can't be bothered
[2:22:16] <%AzureGale> The Doom effect rips and tears your enemies apart
[2:22:21] <Make_me_mad> Apollo is the god of the sun. Also, weirdly, disease.
[2:22:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dinnydanny777 thats atlas
[2:22:27] <%waltzqueen> Apollo drags the sun around in a chariot
[2:22:30] <CrystalLightPeachTea> @dinnydanny777 Apollo is Sun. Atlas holds planet
[2:22:32] <Meekest> I assume Hera and Apollo will be in later updates
[2:22:33] <%blastyoboots> @FlubbedPig why would you find it odd that Apollo is missing he's sort of busy moving the whole SUN
[2:22:33] <%chiazam> wow 11 damage
[2:22:34] <%CrematedCube> The family ties between gods are super vague sometimes
[2:22:42] <SomeAsianDood> Apollo's also the god of music
[2:22:44] <dinnydanny777> @make_me_mad That's weird I was thinking he had something to do with fire tbh
[2:22:52] <%chiazam> wow 4 damage
[2:22:54] <Oxybe> Apollo is the guy who trailer hitched the sun to his celestial dirtbiie
[2:22:57] <ScreamLord> @Make_me_mad Well, the sun can give you cancer
[2:23:03] <stabbityrabbit> That blade dash is so good when you get extra dashes. It's crazy.
[2:23:04] <Sundaysmiles01> they just loved to assign random attributes and hobbies to their gods huh
[2:23:06] <LodBackUp> I thought Helios was the one that drags the sun around
[2:23:08] <Make_me_mad> Apollo's got a lot under his belt. No euphemism implied.
[2:23:12] <mellorolo> ha stinky
[2:23:16] <$realm_forge> AOEs are really fuckin good in this game
[2:23:24] <SomeAsianDood> Phalanx though
[2:23:35] <%TIME_PUNCHER> This game looks like hell psaSmug
[2:23:39] <%linSP> karen is a cool dude
[2:23:39] <%AzureGale> I agree Charon
[2:23:45] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Remember that time in the Illiad when Diomedes clowns on Aphrodite and Ares and has to be persuaded to not do the same to Apollo? :)
[2:23:58] <dinnydanny777> The Titans are all supposed to be monstrous looking right?
[2:24:03] <ScreamLord> @Make_me_mad Isn't Helios ALSO God of the Sun?
[2:24:08] <%KoiRedd> Nice to see some normal British accents in a game for once
[2:24:20] <artificiallynatural> Heeeey Guuuurl
[2:24:31] <President_valentine> Horny
[2:24:34] <anAngryHamster> @screamlord That's the Roman equivalent
[2:24:39] <+pectusumbra> yeah dying lament is really good. gives you lots of crowd control
[2:24:46] <Make_me_mad> My favorite part of the Illiad is when the Gods decide they're imitating humanity and going to war with each other, too. And they just have an embarrassingly tame slap-fight and then go back to Olympus.
[2:25:00] <KnightAsteran> fun fact, Aphrodite was born from Cronus' severed ballparkbeing tossed into he ocean
[2:25:01] <Oxybe> wow
[2:25:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dinnydanny777 in traditional texts titans had 2 heads 4 arms and 4 legs much like man used to have
[2:25:12] <%chiazam> THE BOI
[2:25:13] <%CrematedCube> All the goddesses are such crazy bitches to one another
[2:25:16] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> well, its great for already weak enemies

[2:26:00] <%chiazam> You can't
[2:26:01] <penitentpentwitch> Need to give Sisyphus some juice first
[2:26:01] <+FlubbedPig> Maybe he has to introduce you first?
[2:26:02] <President_valentine> Athena was born from Zeus getting his head split open
[2:26:03] <+queaks> they lied
[2:26:03] <reonome> later i think
[2:26:04] <@SSaryn> Probably after a while
[2:26:04] <Sundaysmiles01> cant pet boulder? game ruined
[2:26:05] <%KoiRedd> Cheers, Geezer

[2:26:09] <SomeAsianDood> you have to get to a certain point
[2:26:10] <ScreamLord> @anAngryHamster No I'm pretty sure they are both Greek Gods of the Sun. Tho apparently Appolo is more of a God of Light than the Sun
[2:26:14] <ergulor> you have to become BBF with sisyphus
[2:26:20] <%Saltmeisterr> Ssaryn is a bitch liar
[2:26:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dinnydanny777 nope titans are the creation myth they made the world and sea and more the greek gods then stole them and run the world
[2:26:26] <%za7az> You need to love it more
[2:26:27] <%chiazam> @alwayspronking He makes do with what he has, like his buddy Bouldie

[2:27:29] <Morbidmort> Yes
[2:27:33] <%Saltmeisterr> i would never besmirch bouldy's name @SSaryn
[2:27:37] <MisterArcanine> if you have a status effect it'll apply each one
[2:27:39] <+Tonystarx90> does pat have auto aim on lol
[2:27:39] <chocobodundee> Is this pats first time playing this?
[2:27:45] <CrystalLightPeachTea> @CrematedCube how do I do quick replies like that?
[2:27:45] <%chiazam> nah
[2:27:50] <+klooswep> *Kratos voice* ZOOS
[2:27:58] <SomeAsianDood> @Tonystarx90 he's on controller so i think it's automatic
[2:28:00] <dinnydanny777> @doc_ock_rokc I thought that there were two pantheons, there's Gods like Zeus, Poseidon, etc, and Titans, who are supposed to be lesser and attempted to overthrow the Gods
[2:28:05] <%AzureGale> Electric Shot is p rad
[2:28:07] <Klarrann3> 1
[2:28:08] <+pectusumbra> heavens vengence is a lot of damage
[2:28:10] <%chiazam> reflexes?
[2:28:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Apollo and Helios are BOTH Greek Sun Gods. Helios' Roman name is Sol
[2:28:23] <Sundaysmiles01> this is gonna combo like fuck
[2:28:25] <%CrematedCube> @CrystalLightPeachTea The little reply arrow appears when you mouse over the msg
[2:28:28] <penitentpentwitch> @chocobodundee He's played it before, but the farthest he got was Asterius
[2:28:28] <+Tonystarx90> its tickable
[2:28:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> hence both Apollo and Helios are in God of War
[2:28:30] <SomeAsianDood> @dinnydanny777 titans were before gods and got smashed by them leading to the Olympians
[2:28:34] <+Tonystarx90> but cool though
[2:28:39] <%SharkMissile> Whip me :>
[2:28:39] <MisterArcanine> This game has so much tech I love it
[2:28:43] <popcultureaficionado> nah now a days it's *Kratos Voice* OOOOOOOODAN
[2:28:44] <CrystalLightPeachTea> @CrystalLightPeachTea ah, that must be new
[2:28:45] <chocobodundee> Titans gave birth abuncha the gods
[2:28:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @dinnydanny777 Other way around. Plympians like Zeus and the gang are descebded from the Titans, and overthrew them
[2:28:50] <MisterArcanine> You can just do so many wild combos
[2:28:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dinnydanny777 quite the opposite The Titans were the powerful ones but one got vision that his son a god would overthrow him which lead to chronos eating his children
[2:28:55] <lucas18293> I think they forgot to take that line out
[2:28:56] <chocobodundee> @penitentpentwitch cool, thanks!
[2:28:57] <KnightAsteran> @dinnydanny777 three actually. First was Ouranus and Gaia, they sired the Titans, then the Titans sired the Olympians
[2:28:59] <Meekest> Strong start
[2:29:08] <%Calek> when can you use titan blood? after you unlock all the weapons?
[2:29:15] <Sundaysmiles01> we bullet hell now?
[2:29:17] <+Cacti_Israphe> Meg = Mai from atla
[2:29:20] <anAngryHamster> Remember Chronos eating his children? Shit's wild
[2:29:21] <MisterArcanine> Titans blood is post game*
[2:29:26] <SomeAsianDood> I think you have to make it to the top with a weapon @Calek
[2:29:29] <+vexion_smh> i love how there's constant new lines every now and then even after you died
[2:29:32] <%chiazam> Too small for TV?
[2:29:36] <MisterArcanine> After you clear it you use titan blood to upgrade weapons
[2:29:37] <%Calek> oh I see
[2:29:38] <+queaks> they're the things that look like traps
[2:29:43] <s4lty__lad> so is this a hades only stream or a variety of roguelikes
[2:29:53] <JonEWorldbeater> One-Winged Fury is a strong waifu
[2:30:02] <blitzmentalist> this song reminds me of Schism
[2:30:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Just Hades tonight, more Roguelikes to come
[2:30:10] <+Tonystarx90> @s4lty__lad think its a different game a day
[2:30:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @s4lty__lad hadies only tonight
[2:30:26] <%AzureGale> gj
[2:30:28] <%chiazam> dooooom
[2:30:29] <MisterArcanine> Athena reflect dash is broken as hell
[2:30:30] <s4lty__lad> ight
[2:30:32] <+vexion_smh> pog
[2:30:35] <1MadLadd> DOOM op
[2:30:36] <%chiazam> blud
[2:30:37] <+AbnormalVoid> Furry Vanquished
[2:30:39] <blitzmentalist> ITS BLUD
[2:30:45] <AnonomousGolem> bluhd
[2:30:45] <%AzureGale> Frank, that's blood
[2:30:46] <%emperordread> It's blud
[2:30:48] <+callowbrodie> Thanks Ares
[2:30:52] <%Calek> is there a ton of post game content or is it just a grind
[2:30:53] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> meg has set places she stays at, so your rift can be very effective on her
[2:30:54] <LeRouch_the_Rebel> ADS WHY
[2:31:00] <+Tonystarx90> @MisterArcanine I love attack deflect so much better
[2:31:33] <JonEWorldbeater> Hope this is not CHRIS' blud
[2:31:37] <MisterArcanine> I like the i frames you basically get on your dodge too much but it is sick batting shit back to people
[2:31:37] <SomeAsianDood> @Calek they literally released the full game today. We don't really know LUL
[2:31:39] <%chiazam> I never use the well buffs, are they any good?
[2:31:41] <+Cacti_Israphe> welcome to the bone zone
[2:31:43] <penitentpentwitch> @Calek Beating the final boss is not the end, by a long shot
[2:31:45] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> @Calek both?
[2:31:52] <%Calek> good to know
[2:31:58] <popcultureaficionado> HOW MANY LEVELS?
[2:32:10] <%Saltmeisterr> 4 levels
[2:32:24] <penitentpentwitch> Basically beating the Final Boss starts the final act, which only progresses every time you beat the final boss
[2:32:29] <MisterArcanine> I've been playing this game since early release and was so pumped to see it finally release
[2:32:39] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt whats the farthest you've ever gotten in this game?
[2:32:39] <%Broand> I've not beaten said boss yet
[2:32:56] <%chiazam> Oh wow really?
[2:32:56] <%Saltmeisterr> beating the final boss also unlocks hard mode
[2:32:57] <BLVCKHEART> whats the replay value on this?
[2:33:03] <@SoFarFetched> COME ON AND SLAM
[2:33:10] <+Cacti_Israphe> very high
[2:33:10] <%AzureGale> Minit Tar
[2:33:12] <+Tonystarx90> very replayable
[2:33:14] <chocobodundee> originally I wasnt gonna watch too much of this but I dont think ill ever beat it sooo
[2:33:15] <Sundaysmiles01> minotard?
[2:33:16] <%TheWinged7> what about the normal sized taurs?
[2:33:17] <popcultureaficionado> AND WELCOME TO THE AJ,
[2:33:18] <penitentpentwitch> Hopefully he'll meet the boss of Elysium on stream, though that depends on how long he'll stream
[2:33:19] <%Saltmeisterr> AND WELCOME TO THE JAM
[2:33:23] <SomeAsianDood> It's a roguelike. Replayability is nuts
[2:33:34] <BLVCKHEART> nice!!! thats all i was worried about
[2:33:34] <%chiazam> @PatStaresAt So not the final boss of Elysium?
[2:33:37] <$realm_forge> Are the boons random?
[2:33:38] <%AzureGale> COME ON AND SLAM
[2:33:40] <%Broand> loads of replay value because every run has good variance, unlike a lot of roguelikes
[2:33:44] <BLVCKHEART> ive never played a roguelike tbh
[2:33:45] <MisterArcanine> @BLVCKHEART the game is a lot longer than you'd think for one, and two its made to replay and experience new runs and unlock new side quests and stories with your companions
[2:33:50] <+Cacti_Israphe> boons are semi random
[2:33:54] <popcultureaficionado> AND WELCOME TO THE JAM
[2:33:55] <%byuniart> Wait did I miss Pyre?
[2:33:56] <SomeAsianDood> miniboss of elysium @chiazam not final boss
[2:33:56] <VritraReiRei> @BLVCKHEART near infinite. after you beat the game, you unlock ways to make the game harder and unlock more NPC side quests, essentially like NG+
[2:34:01] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> you're too good at video games, it took me a long time to get to the second level
[2:34:02] <+Cacti_Israphe> or rather mostly random
[2:34:03] <CrystalLightPeachTea> >How bad could it be Kappa
[2:34:09] <@SoFarFetched> @byuniart he's skipping pyre because Hades 1.0 released today.
[2:34:13] <chocobodundee> @byuniart he jumped to this instead cause of the full release
[2:34:13] <%waltzqueen> @byuniart hes skipping for now and coming back to it
[2:34:17] <BLVCKHEART> holy shit. im buying it rn
[2:34:22] <%Monkeyweed21> Does Pat know how to get free money from Charon?
[2:34:30] <%byuniart> Oh word?
[2:34:31] <+Jaysky> Confirmed Pat hates Pyre what an animal
[2:34:32] <@SoFarFetched> Pyre will probably be at a later date TBD
[2:34:33] <%byuniart> kk
[2:34:34] <%xcompleasedad> xcompleasedad subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 11 month streak! Oh, hey. A year. Not the best $60 I've ever spent, but not the worst.
[2:34:37] <SomeAsianDood> @Monkeyweed21 "free"
[2:34:50] <%chiazam> Charon at 127?
[2:34:53] <@SoFarFetched> Just like Pat is doing FF7 on PS1 later Kappa

[2:35:04] <%chiazam> @Monkeyweed21 Eh?
[2:35:05] <%AzureGale> Phlegethon is a good name for a marathon :x
[2:35:06] <%Monkeyweed21> yea there's free gold behind charon
[2:35:07] <%Saltmeisterr> Yes "free" money
[2:35:08] <%byuniart> pfft sure
[2:35:10] <penitentpentwitch> Not a phrase you should say in public...
[2:35:16] <MisterArcanine> Its a fairly forgiving Roguelike you get stronger constantly, and you get so much overpowered bullshit to counter their overpowered bullshit
[2:35:37] <MisterArcanine> sometimes you just get those set ups that want you to win the game lol
[2:35:41] <+Cacti_Israphe> @PatStaresAt romance Dusa
[2:36:19] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> wheel better
[2:36:22] <penitentpentwitch> Speaking of Dusa
[2:36:30] <+Jaysky> Fake dusa

[2:37:21] <penitentpentwitch> Eekum Bokumed
[2:37:23] <CrystalLightPeachTea> What is it that decides whether or not you'll defy death? Is it a visible stat, a hidden one, or pure chance?
[2:37:25] <MisterArcanine> Pat give a nectar to Cereberus
[2:37:28] <%KoiRedd> psaDown
[2:37:28] <blitzmentalist> vineMortis

[2:37:35] <%RyTYoung> LUL
[2:37:36] <Oxybe> LUL
[2:37:42] <%kknutson4> Death Defiance is a mirror upgrade
[2:37:47] <SomeAsianDood> @CrystalLightPeachTea you get one for free it's an upgrade and you can buy some from a shop someimes
[2:37:48] <chocobodundee> @CrystalLightPeachTea its an upgrade, with a finite amount
[2:37:52] <MisterArcanine> noooo
[2:37:52] <+Cacti_Israphe> isn't defy death a token counter? like starts at 1
[2:37:54] <+callowbrodie> thabToxic thabToxic
[2:37:55] <penitentpentwitch> @CrystalLightPeachTea It's an upgrade you can unlock. Some boons will refund it if you used it during a run.
[2:37:56] <MisterArcanine> doggy isn't there
[2:37:57] <%kknutson4> You can get 3 + 1 from a keepsake
[2:37:57] <+AbnormalVoid> ooohhh

[2:38:16] <Oxybe> PUPPER IS MISSING!
[2:38:24] <%Monkeyweed21> @chiazam there's a sack of free gold you can find behind Charon if you need a little more to afford a boon or pomegranite
[2:38:27] <penitentpentwitch> @Cacti_Israphe Death Defiance starts at zero, but it's a cheap unlock
[2:38:30] <%linSP> dangit bobbeh
[2:38:30] <generalve> @PatStaresAt Does Zangief have a bag ?
[2:38:33] <dinnydanny777> It's kind of funny how Hades really isn't that much of a shit as far as I know
[2:38:35] <MisterArcanine> @Cacti_Israphe you upgrade it via the mirror and you basically get 3 extra lives when you max it out
[2:38:40] <%AzureGale> Thank Kratos
[2:38:42] <%anticrust> ACHILLIES!!!!!!!!!
[2:38:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Zangief is a bag
[2:38:46] <dinnydanny777> By comparison to someone like Zeus at least
[2:38:46] <%byuniart> God the art design is always so nice
[2:38:47] <%kknutson4> Give gift to Skelly
[2:38:47] <ShichiNoBushi> Shake the bag.
[2:38:47] <%CrematedCube> Death defy works a lot like resurrections in Sekiro
[2:38:51] <%iamnolionheart> Zangief got wrankles
[2:38:59] <ChungusQuest> Dog is all bag
[2:39:03] <+Cacti_Israphe> >simping meg
[2:39:05] <+Jaysky> Hades is actually one of the nicer Gods as far as I'm aware
[2:39:06] <SomeAsianDood> I like how Logan Cunningham does zeus, poseidon and hades. Thematically appropriate
[2:39:13] <%chiazam> Heyyyyy gurrrrl
[2:39:22] <%RyTYoung> Most doggos have saggy necks so the mother doggo can pick them up by the scruff of their neck
[2:39:23] <boardscanada> this looks quite good, and I normally don't like western indie games much
[2:39:28] <Sundaysmiles01> so tsundere
[2:39:30] <+Cacti_Israphe> in this underworld palace we simp Dusa
[2:39:32] <%iamnolionheart> It's not like she likes you or anything
[2:39:33] <%AzureGale> BURN
[2:39:34] <%Saltmeisterr> wait is is elmo's stomach is bag? i also thought u guys where referring to his balls
[2:39:35] <%chiazam> SICK BURN
[2:39:35] <s1rcuit> @Jaysky He kidnapped Persephone
[2:39:35] <%BubbaRands> kiiiiiiiissssssss
[2:39:36] <%TheWinged7> oof LUL
[2:39:36] <rbakervv> tsundare!
[2:39:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Nice!
[2:39:39] <+3amsoda> meg tsundere?
[2:39:43] <%Tenkay> shes tsundere
[2:39:43] <%linSP> yayyy
[2:39:44] <MisterArcanine> its my game of the year tbh
[2:39:46] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I want Meg to grind me into a puddle
[2:39:46] <%AzureGale> b-baka
[2:39:50] <+Cacti_Israphe> Cerberus best employee
[2:40:02] <%iamnolionheart> We simp Thanatos and his dumb Trunks haircut
[2:40:03] <+Jaysky> @s1rcuit As opposed to his brother who went about raping folks?
[2:40:23] <SomeAsianDood> @s1rcuit not totally true. He was told by zeus that he had a marriage with persephone and zeus just kinda forgot to inform demeter about it
[2:40:26] <MisterArcanine> Thanatos is Zag's true love , Meg is his dom
[2:40:29] <%chiazam> They actually can't see what Zagreus looks like
[2:40:41] <+Cacti_Israphe> Cerberus employee of the aeon, every aeon
[2:40:44] <penitentpentwitch> Oh boy! Plot advancement!
[2:40:44] <Oxybe> @cacti_israphe every month all months
[2:40:47] <%kyh9> So basically the Olympians are sending text messages, they're not actually directly present in Tartarus
[2:41:03] <%iamnolionheart> It's more like a pager
[2:41:15] <chocobodundee> I love when zag defies the narrator
[2:41:16] <%linSP> dang it zag you're breaking the 4th wall again
[2:41:17] <spacecatstreams> did pat start new save?
[2:41:25] <%weissguard> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[2:41:44] <%chiazam> I WANT TO MEET THE OLD MAN SO BAD
[2:41:59] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt You would've been fine continuing
[2:42:00] <chocobodundee> isnt the narrator another god?
[2:42:05] <s1rcuit> @Jaysky That doesn't excuse him and @SomeAsianDood I didn't know that
[2:42:05] <spacecatstreams> i just started my new save. feels like the right move but I really miss my stuff already
[2:42:06] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Ah, that explains why you're so good at the game already despite having just started.
[2:42:09] <%AzureGale> whoooooooooooooo are you. who who, who who
[2:42:32] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah cause pat stopped playing at a certain point until it fully released.
[2:42:33] <%chiazam> I'm pretty sure they didn't add anything to the beginning Pat
[2:42:37] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> New game makes sense for 1.0
[2:43:02] <@SSaryn> Yeah there's tons even from just the new 1.0 patch alone.
[2:43:02] <%Calek> WHAT A TWIST
[2:43:04] <@SoFarFetched> psa1guy at it again
[2:43:09] <reonome> this was in pretty early on
[2:43:10] <ergulor> remember that pat played a long time ago
[2:43:16] <lazygertt> let pat have fun lol
[2:43:16] <%Daniel_Is_I> Just ignore the psa1guy
[2:43:21] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> What timing.
[2:43:25] <tattleworm> this was in like patch 1
[2:43:25] <%iamnolionheart> Pat this isn't new lol psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaCrazy
[2:43:26] <donkymagooterson> damn I would rather die than be near you
[2:43:26] <+MadWolf1290> Persephone - welp.
[2:43:27] <%Tearonex> This stuff has been here for months but, I know he hasn't played for a while
[2:43:29] <%chiazam> Is that new? Becuase I've seen that
[2:43:29] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Pat literally didn't even see Nyx's character thing until today.
[2:43:29] <penitentpentwitch> So the plot of the game literally started because the Narrator spoiled the plot and the main character heard him.
[2:43:34] <%CrematedCube> Pat played a much older version
[2:43:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> mom isn't mom, hot persimmon lady is mom
[2:43:35] <@SSaryn> Also keep in mind guys, he literally hasn't played like, almost any of the newer patches since like last year.
[2:43:36] <%kyh9> Narrator, what the fuck
[2:43:37] <%AzureGale> HEAVEN OR HELL. DUEL 1. LET'S ROCK!
[2:43:38] <%Calek> I like how the narrator just spoils it for Zag
[2:43:38] <%Daniel_Is_I> Spoiled by the narrator LUL
[2:43:40] <+Cacti_Israphe> honestly, I'd take Nix over Persphone
[2:43:44] <SomeAsianDood> goddamnit narrator
[2:43:47] <ShichiNoBushi> Aaawww... Poor Cerberus.
[2:43:49] <reonome> narrator spoiled the plot LUL

[2:44:05] <s1rcuit> good job Narrator!
[2:44:06] <+CatsEyeBlind> Overly-reliable narrator
[2:44:06] <@SoFarFetched> Time to ban the narrator LUL
[2:44:10] <%za7az> LUL
[2:44:11] <1MadLadd> snitch narrator
[2:44:13] <chocobodundee> narrator is persephone, calling it now
[2:44:13] <OperatorJo_> Narrator caused all of this
[2:44:14] <%ElkRiverDog> Mud is your great grandma
[2:44:14] <+3amsoda> what a great inciting incident
[2:44:16] <Morbidmort> Is Zagreus just combat Shinji?
[2:44:17] <dinnydanny777> The narrator is the chat :)
[2:44:20] <%chiazam> The narrator won't shut up
[2:44:22] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I love that the narrator is diagetic, it's so good
[2:44:24] <%RyTYoung> Narrator is the one guy Lul
[2:44:26] <%weissguard> Narrator is being a psa1guy
[2:44:27] <Make_me_mad> On-brand for a greek god to abandon their child, but still Persephone, dick move.
[2:44:29] <%Calek> there's a great Hades x Persephone comic by Sigeel who's exploring the romance between the two
[2:44:29] <spacecatstreams> i wonder if 1.0 reveals the true identity of Skelly
[2:44:34] <+Cacti_Israphe> Narrator is literally dad tho
[2:44:36] <%Calek> not related to this game though
[2:44:41] <Oxybe> Nyx just trying to be a good stepmom.
[2:44:42] <reonome> oh shit i've never seen this portrait
[2:44:43] <popcultureaficionado> lol 4th wall breaking narrator
[2:44:45] <%weissguard> God, Nyx is super hot.
[2:44:47] <%za7az> @PatStaresAt Are you going to ban the narrator for spoilers? KappaHD
[2:44:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's only cause you're a douche, Zag
[2:44:48] <penitentpentwitch> Bonus points if the Narrator ends up being Daedalus.

[2:45:53] <%Monkeyweed21> but you can suck death's dick
[2:45:55] <%za7az> @CrematedCube but they sound completely different
[2:45:55] <donkymagooterson> epic stache
[2:45:55] <@SoFarFetched> Thanatos? more like Fan of TOES
[2:45:56] <%AzureGale> Is Hades an edgelord
[2:45:58] <%angel949> I think he means the concept
[2:45:59] <%Saltmeisterr> SPHEED
[2:45:59] <artificiallynatural> he's def gonna be if I can have my way
[2:46:00] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt they're actually homies
[2:46:02] <dinnydanny777> Is the main character Dante now?
[2:46:05] <LordOfThePoultry> death as in dead dead
[2:46:07] <%Daniel_Is_I> Eyyy Hermes
[2:46:08] <aeonicvector> HEY god of theives and roads
[2:46:12] <penitentpentwitch> 35 Win Streak going strong, boy do the higher pact levels make it hard
[2:46:12] <%kyh9> They introduced him earlier
[2:46:13] <JaseAdrift> SCHPEED
[2:46:17] <%iamnolionheart> Fun fact: Zagreus doesn't know what birds are
[2:46:18] <%kyh9> @dinnydanny777 no, Hades' son
[2:46:19] <count_bob> ONE MORE DASH
[2:46:24] <Make_me_mad> I like that he compares it to a bat wing, because he's presumably never seen a bird.
[2:46:25] <SomeAsianDood> I love that than's never seen a bird. Of course he wouldn
[2:46:37] <%AzureGale> Always get the bonus dashes upgrade when you can
[2:46:42] <chocobodundee> zag is himbo
[2:46:45] <$realm_forge> Gotta go fast!
[2:46:48] <%chiazam> @SomeAsianDood No demon birds?
[2:46:51] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Hades can eat a dick
[2:46:52] <%Broand> Hermes is has only speed options iirc
[2:46:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> The narrator has to be the skeleton.
[2:46:54] <aeonicvector> btw @PatStaresAt the hermes trinket is p good
[2:46:58] <Aydarkzero> they're weird
[2:47:02] <%AzureGale> Witches got the raddest hats
[2:47:03] <%chiazam> They're witches
[2:47:04] <%Monkeyweed21> they ruined the new Mulan
[2:47:05] <+conradical> i like the faster cast when you get 3 casts
[2:47:10] <Decarcassor> Did they buff Hermes ? I tend to avoid him as his gifts don't do much on their own. :/
[2:47:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> what's the deal with airline food
[2:47:12] <SomeAsianDood> @chiazam only thing with wings are furies/bats
[2:47:14] <Oxybe> "What is a bird, and why do i want to eat one deep fried?"
[2:47:16] <ShichiNoBushi> They're sometimes hot.
[2:47:17] <KaiserMario> witches are magic wenches
[2:47:19] <SomeAsianDood> at least in hell apparently
[2:47:20] <penitentpentwitch> I still follow the logic that Paige IS a witch. But she's untrained and keeps cursing herself.
[2:47:43] <donkymagooterson> paige got that wolf curse
[2:47:45] <%waltzqueen> @penitentpentwitch you.....make a lot of sense
[2:47:49] <@SoFarFetched> instead of "stop hitting yourself" it's "stop cursing yourself"
[2:47:53] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt pretty sure witches are worshipers of Hecate, dark goddess of magic or something like that
[2:47:55] <+Cacti_Israphe> witches in tartarus are just white girls who "aren't like other girls"
[2:47:59] <%chiazam> Damn I want some hot fried chicken
[2:48:00] <Morbidmort> @Decarcassor Well he is the god of those why live by their wits
[2:48:04] <%WholesomeSandwhichPeddler> Hey Pat y’all mentioned on the podcast cheaters getting their comeuppance, and I wanted to mention a amazing Dark Souls video called “I am Invincible” where you get to experience a salty cheater saying some real scrubquotes like “There’s a difference between me dying and you killing me”
[2:48:06] <%Daniel_Is_I> Nah Paige was cursed by a witch AKA a crazy person
[2:48:12] <+alphonseisbest> is this out fully now?
[2:48:17] <@SoFarFetched> yup
[2:48:20] <@SoFarFetched> just today
[2:48:21] <chocobodundee> ya
[2:48:23] <SomeAsianDood> yup 1.0 dropped today
[2:48:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Paige's WIS is too low and that's why her spells keep backifiring
[2:48:27] <+alphonseisbest> dope!
[2:48:31] <penitentpentwitch> @alphonseisbest 1.0 released today
[2:48:32] <cascadepersona> Man, I sure do love Stars and Stripes
[2:48:46] <%chiazam> They have so much frickin' dialogue
[2:48:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> @penitentpentwitch Naw, Paige is a werewolf. That's why she's afraid of night time
[2:48:55] <+Tonystarx90> did this release on ps4 then or will be soon?
[2:49:08] <@SoFarFetched> not yet
[2:49:08] <Vashido22> they haven't confirmed a ps4 release yet
[2:49:22] <+Tonystarx90> ah sadness, thanks
[2:49:28] <%Calek> turns it into a mark
[2:49:28] <%Piemono> Having only 1 cast isn't great either
[2:49:33] <%TheWinged7> you also only have the one cast
[2:49:34] <%AzureGale> Pat doesn't have the things that make the cast good
[2:49:35] <penitentpentwitch> Still gotta buy that cast upgrade first
[2:49:38] <+alphonseisbest> does anyone know how thks runs on the switch?
[2:49:40] <%chiazam> @rumtumtugnutz Her being a werewolf doesn't account for her hatred of wahmen tho
[2:49:41] <@SoFarFetched> yeah its only pc and switch for now
[2:49:43] <chocobodundee> default cast pretty weak
[2:49:43] <%Monkeyweed21> If Pat was a cthonic god would he be "Goblins Incarnate"
[2:49:44] <%CrematedCube> It needs upgrades before it is worth using
[2:49:47] <@StridentSong> As someone who's cleared this game 100+ times, I still forget I have Cast like 90% of the time
[2:49:53] <+conradical> cast ends up being so good
[2:49:57] <CrystalLightPeachTea> So the promethean stone is the Cast, right
[2:49:57] <$autcetera> God Supergiant is so good
[2:49:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> I didn't like cast much in this game. Payoff is rarely wiorth the effort.
[2:49:59] <@StridentSong> No time to cast when blending the enemy with dash-attacks
[2:50:02] <Ids560> yeah having 1 that you have to go pick up sucks
[2:50:12] <Decarcassor> Base level cast without any gift or mirror upgrade is not great.
[2:50:16] <%chiazam> Cast is so good with the buffs
[2:50:26] <@StridentSong> DASHING WALLOP
[2:50:27] <%Calek> you piercing shot though
[2:50:29] <aeonicvector> 3
[2:50:30] <stabbityrabbit> I'm always fond of Wallop.
[2:50:34] <%za7az> 3
[2:50:35] <+conradical> dashing
[2:50:37] <@StridentSong> Dash-Spin to Win
[2:50:40] <%chiazam> dash or flight
[2:50:40] <Ids560> wallop is sick
[2:50:42] <%Bearjewpiter> no cast, only hit SMOrc
[2:50:45] <chocobodundee> these all seem cool
[2:50:46] <SomeAsianDood> so long as not charged shot
[2:50:49] <%chiazam> holy shit
[2:50:50] <penitentpentwitch> The big ole backhand
[2:50:50] <+conradical> then get a good dash skill
[2:50:51] <aeonicvector> YUP
[2:50:54] <@StridentSong> Now hope you get Artemis for her Dash-Attack boon
[2:50:55] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Go for Aphrodite
[2:50:57] <%koolaid_kevster> ELMO!
[2:50:58] <%za7az> YEAH
[2:50:59] <KaiserMario> WHOA BIG
[2:50:59] <+alphonseisbest> is this worth picking up if switch is ur only option? @PatStaresAt
[2:51:00] <%LailahQueenx> psaBig
[2:51:02] <%linSP> dude this game wrecked my thumb after playing 3 hours of it
[2:51:05] <+conradical> athena
[2:51:06] <@StridentSong> And just ride to victory
[2:51:13] <TurtlesAndTentacles> so he changes abilities everytime?
[2:51:16] <@StridentSong> Yea, Athena's Diving Dash would also be good
[2:51:25] <@StridentSong> Divine^
[2:51:40] <%chiazam> OOF
[2:51:47] <+Jaysky> Well it doesn't like you
[2:51:54] <@StridentSong> Come on Divine Dash
[2:52:02] <+conradical> don't forget you can dash over the gaps
[2:52:05] <@StridentSong> YEYEYEYE
[2:52:06] <VritraReiRei> PogChamp
[2:52:08] <@StridentSong> BLENDER STRATTS
[2:52:11] <stabbityrabbit> This is the crowd clear boss. If you don't have good crowd clear, get fucked.
[2:52:13] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Oh boy
[2:52:13] <%RyTYoung> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:52:14] <%chiazam> OH YEAH
[2:52:14] <%l3sovikk> Artemis has the best dash in the game
[2:52:16] <count_bob> Pat, you know if you you hold the charge on the bullrush, you are immune to those beams?
[2:52:24] <Oxybe> Beyblade time!
[2:52:24] <OperatorJo_> THE RUN BEGINS
[2:52:29] <%Jeemukun> wonder where demeter is, she's your grandma aunt
[2:52:29] <@SSaryn> Yo Strident
[2:52:31] <%chiazam> literal best dash in the game
[2:52:34] <@SSaryn> Some of these new boons are fucking kickass
[2:52:47] <@SSaryn> Even the new items are actually worth running Bone Hourglass
[2:52:50] <SomeAsianDood> @Jeemukun gotta get to the last boss and youll meet her
[2:52:52] <%Badass_Hobo> Badass_Hobo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Nice hades, how has our favorite orb been handling hell and all of zags crazy family?
[2:52:53] <+conradical> Athena's call and dash is probably my favorite in the game
[2:52:53] <+coshmack> is this transistor 2?
[2:52:53] <%Jeemukun> god thinking about the greek gods family tree is, disconcerting
[2:53:03] <%chiazam> @SSaryn New boons?
[2:53:07] <penitentpentwitch> Gyro and Crits!
[2:53:13] <@SSaryn> New boons from Gods.
[2:53:24] <%Monkeyweed21> get the free gold and you can get everything in the shop @PatStaresAt
[2:53:28] <Vashido22> crazy how artemis is the best girl and it isn't even a debate
[2:53:31] <SomeAsianDood> BEST GURL ARTEMIS
[2:53:33] <%CrematedCube> I really do like this game, but it also terribly ruins my sleep patterns, it makes my dreams super fidgety
[2:53:35] <%RyTYoung> @patstaresat Would you play Spelunky 2 this month? I would say it falls under the rogue-lite category of game
[2:53:47] <%CrematedCube> Otherwise I'd play it a lot more
[2:53:50] <%Sausious> look at all those Vauthrys
[2:53:53] <%za7az> Welcome to psaBig damage
[2:54:07] <aeonicvector> i would also be interested in see you play spelunky 2
[2:54:17] <penitentpentwitch> Rematch!
[2:54:24] <%Badass_Hobo> double god room is always worth it
[2:54:25] <penitentpentwitch> Choose Artemis first this time
[2:54:25] <%FacetiousAF> yeah athena dash PogChamp
[2:54:26] <%Daniel_Is_I> Now what did we learn last time, Pat?
[2:54:27] <Morbidmort> Trial time
[2:54:31] <%Daniel_Is_I> Don't go against Artemis
[2:54:34] <+Tonystarx90> Dionysus is the major bro
[2:54:37] <LordOfThePoultry> artemis
[2:54:47] <%Monkeyweed21> @CrematedCube look at this coward not having constant nightmares from all your trauma
[2:54:53] <penitentpentwitch> Support fire or pressure!
[2:54:53] <+Tonystarx90> oh this track slaps hard
[2:54:55] <+pectusumbra> support fire!
[2:54:56] <stabbityrabbit> SUPPORT FIRE
[2:54:56] <+FlubbedPig> Support Fire
[2:54:57] <+queaks> 2
[2:54:57] <+pectusumbra> super good
[2:54:58] <%Badass_Hobo> support fire is pretty good
[2:54:58] <VritraReiRei> SUPPORT FIRE PogChamp
[2:54:58] <Vashido22> support fire is fun
[2:54:58] <artificiallynatural> support fire is badass

[2:55:02] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> suppotr firre
[2:55:02] <%za7az> 2
[2:55:02] <%Daniel_Is_I> 2
[2:55:04] <+FlubbedPig> Absolutely Support Fire
[2:55:07] <+pectusumbra> 2 for sure
[2:55:09] <%linSP> 2% is like 1 out of every 50 hits
[2:55:10] <+conradical> 2
[2:55:16] <+arvan599> support fire rules
[2:55:18] <%AzureGale> She mad
[2:55:20] <Vashido22> Support fire on the gun is fucking dumb and I loveit
[2:55:21] <+pectusumbra> one of the best boons on anything but the slowest weapons
[2:55:23] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Support Fire seems real good
[2:55:30] <SomeAsianDood> athena malding
[2:55:34] <%linSP> why are gods such shits
[2:55:34] <OperatorJo_> almost like
[2:55:39] <Decarcassor> Support fire is nice, but not great for the shield
[2:55:51] <Decarcassor> Now support fire on the Adamant Rail... Ooooh boy.
[2:55:52] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Like we said, Hades is the most reasonable Olympian
[2:55:53] <+Jaysky> Better Athena mad than arrow cute
[2:55:56] <Aydarkzero> gods being assholes? say it aint so
[2:56:02] <%MelBrooksKA> @linSP probably the incest
[2:56:04] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Y'know who we haven't seen in awhile? Dionysus.
[2:56:04] <+conradical> yo don't dash onto traps
[2:56:05] <%CrematedCube> @Monkeyweed21 Funnily enough, the antidote is MonHun. It completely fixes the problem
[2:56:05] <%Chimeraelite> how fickle the gods are
[2:56:14] <donkymagooterson> too much power turns you into a big shit I guess
[2:56:15] <1MadLadd> athena loses: i see no reason to be angry LUL
[2:56:19] <%za7az> 2
[2:56:22] <%Chimeraelite> Trying to kill you one moment, seeing the error only after you manage to survive
[2:56:26] <stabbityrabbit> Support Fire is super good in general. It is significantly better on fast hitting weapons though.
[2:56:27] <%Chimeraelite> SALTY
[2:56:28] <penitentpentwitch> Mystery god
[2:56:35] <aeonicvector> ?!?
[2:56:36] <%waltzqueen> Pat, if you had to pick one god and stay loyal, who would you shoose?
[2:56:36] <%Saltmeisterr> random boon
[2:56:37] <chocobodundee> neat
[2:56:40] <+KingofTwitchTV> is this a new game?

[2:57:09] <%za7az> dunno tbh
[2:57:12] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> they're all okay
[2:57:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @kingoftwitchtv if by new, you mean "out of early access"
[2:57:33] <penitentpentwitch> "Let her go. Let her go~"
[2:57:39] <+conradical> meg lemme smash

[2:57:53] <+KingofTwitchTV> ah ok thx @someasiandood
[2:57:57] <Vashido22> a lot
[2:58:03] <huskarl_zap> Peter "Shut up Meg."
[2:58:03] <%Calek> decent handful, then you fight her sisters
[2:58:03] <$autcetera> I love when Kristen Stewart-level voice acting fits a character
[2:58:07] <+Jaysky> @donkymagooterson As many times as she wants
[2:58:11] <SomeAsianDood> meg... telling people that their mom is gone is not how you flirt
[2:58:12] <$realm_forge> God her voice is gorgeous
[2:58:18] <Oxybe> Girl is just doing her nine-to-infinity. its her job.
[2:58:26] <%hq_residential_house> soundtrack so good
[2:58:34] <penitentpentwitch> Every time into that spike trap
[2:58:41] <Sundaysmiles01> Spindash
[2:58:46] <donkymagooterson> @Jaysky LUL
[2:59:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> careful, you are half dead
[2:59:04] <OperatorJo_> Dash to victory!
[2:59:11] <Aydarkzero> bodied LUL

[2:59:17] <MisterArcanine> Support fire is busted good
[2:59:17] <%hq_residential_house> LUL
[2:59:23] <%chiazam> GG EZ
[2:59:24] <Vashido22> PAT
[2:59:25] <Vashido22> LUL
[2:59:25] <%Typhaeon> I want to give her some honeyed tea for that broken voice
[2:59:28] <MisterArcanine> Free damage constantly
[2:59:30] <+FlubbedPig> Wow spoilers Zag, he doesn't even know that yet
[2:59:41] <LordOfThePoultry> secrets out LUL
[2:59:49] <penitentpentwitch> The bracer seems doofy, but it's really good the more HP you have
[2:59:51] <%SWFanatic> Momento Mori
[3:00:09] <+conradical> you should probably get a bunch of nectars and start collecting your keepsakes
[3:00:14] <Aydarkzero> Ace
[3:00:30] <Decarcassor> Cerberus Keepsake is great for early game.
[3:00:38] <%chiazam> Is getting Well of Charon items worth it?
[3:00:38] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat, can you pat your pet on his butt for a bit?
[3:00:39] <penitentpentwitch> The whole "Effective HP" argument and such
[3:00:51] <kingra> <3
[3:00:56] <Vashido22> good
[3:01:02] <MisterArcanine> yeah Cerb and skelly have really really good beginner keepsakes
[3:01:03] <Sundaysmiles01> Elmo appreciates the buttpats
[3:01:04] <%Monkeyweed21> can you pet your Pat on the butt for a bit?
[3:01:06] <%GohanHitsugaya> <3
[3:01:26] <Sundaysmiles01> Will it Blend?
[3:01:29] <chocobodundee> does athena dash make you invulnerable or just deflect projectiles
[3:01:34] <%SWFanatic> is that like mixer?
[3:01:49] <Ids560> both
[3:01:53] <%Saltmeisterr> key
[3:01:55] <%chiazam> @chocobodundee Deflect, you're already invulnerable during dash
[3:02:01] <+KingofTwitchTV> gotcha @shinobiphoenix thx
[3:02:04] <Oxybe> Will it Beyblade?
[3:02:12] <chocobodundee> gotcha
[3:02:16] <%AzureGale> Get more darkness like the chunni you are
[3:02:17] <Virokwet> lil babu
[3:02:43] <%Saltmeisterr> remember when the dash used to be super stiff?
[3:02:44] <%CrematedCube> I don't remember these kickboxer guys
[3:02:56] <%Saltmeisterr> at like the launch of the game
[3:02:56] <SomeAsianDood> They were added last patch
[3:03:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Don't be rude
[3:03:16] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt the enemies can get hurt in lava so try to knock 'em in it
[3:03:16] <%Saltmeisterr> yeah the blue guys are new
[3:03:29] <Meekest> I never got Thanatos to show up when I played
[3:03:50] <+Tonystarx90> did they remove the stone head + madusa mini boss room? i havent been seeing it lately
[3:03:54] <+jjjkopf> this a fresh save?
[3:04:00] <SomeAsianDood> I think you have to at least beat the third stage for him to start showing up? @Meekest
[3:04:05] <SomeAsianDood> nope still there @Tonystarx90
[3:04:07] <Vashido22> @Tonystarx90 no, its still there
[3:04:07] <MisterArcanine> Thanatos shows up at some point in the 3rd area
[3:04:08] <stabbityrabbit> It's still in there.
[3:04:10] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Hermes!
[3:04:10] <Grandma_Amari> HERMES
[3:04:10] <%Saltmeisterr> SPHEED
[3:04:10] <count_bob> MORE DASH
[3:04:11] <%chiazam> Hermes
[3:04:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Tonystarx90 Pat died to it a few runs ago

[3:04:20] <VritraReiRei> Artemis, it's upgraded @PatStaresAt
[3:04:20] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> hermes is super rare
[3:04:20] <%chiazam> SPEED
[3:04:20] <KaiserMario> There's a skull on that one
[3:04:24] <Meekest> @SomeAsianDood Thats the weird thing, I beat the last boss twice and various runs, never saw Thanatos once
[3:04:25] <tolloponik> DASH! DASH Dam dam danam
[3:04:28] <%Saltmeisterr> YEAH FAST
[3:04:28] <Grandma_Amari> YES
[3:04:28] <%blastyoboots> you're at pretty low health for a challenge room yeah hermes is safer
[3:04:29] <penitentpentwitch> Hermes has a chance for "Side Hustle" or "Nier Automata Dodge"
[3:04:29] <+FlubbedPig> Anyone know what the skull icon on the door means?
[3:04:29] <+pectusumbra> hermes since it's easier fight
[3:04:29] <%za7az> hermes
[3:04:30] <LeRouch_the_Rebel> Yay Mercury

[3:05:31] <SomeAsianDood> I mean it's just money right? hammer=200g boons=150. Of course hammers better
[3:05:33] <Vashido22> I'm sad about no Pyre, but still todaythaving fun
[3:05:35] <%Saltmeisterr> 2
[3:05:39] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt Hermes is GUARANTEED to show up twice per run, regardless if you ignore him or not so it's not always necessary to grab right away, just like the Daedlus Hammer
[3:05:41] <%Saltmeisterr> DOOM
[3:05:43] <+JVolfram> The Hermster
[3:05:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Pyre soon at least
[3:05:49] <count_bob> I hate the new vignetting they have when you get low health.
[3:05:50] <KaiserMario> Marte

[3:06:17] <MisterArcanine> I once got a Hermes Side Hustle boon my first room and was like "oh im gonna be rich as fuck"
[3:06:21] <LordOfThePoultry> SourPls
[3:06:25] <%KoiRedd> Good music is good
[3:06:37] <penitentpentwitch> Strangely, an appropriate number of bones on The Furry Barge
[3:06:52] <chocobodundee> i wanna get off this boat
[3:06:59] <%chiazam> @VritraReiRei Although up to two Hammers will always be offered, it is not guaranteed they will be offered again, should Zagreus choose to not take it.
[3:07:11] <%Saltmeisterr> DOOM
[3:07:12] <1MadLadd> DOOM
[3:07:16] <penitentpentwitch> Curse of Pain!
[3:07:16] <Vashido22> DOOM
[3:07:19] <kingra> AREEEEESSS
[3:07:21] <%afronooch> DOOM
[3:07:21] <Morbidmort> DOOM
[3:07:23] <%CrematedCube> Rage is great
[3:07:23] <%SWFanatic> DOOOM
[3:07:24] <%bevyrage> doom
[3:07:26] <+boybyfresh> DOOM
[3:07:26] <+queaks> 1
[3:07:27] <aeonicvector> 3 or 1
[3:07:27] <%bevyrage> 1 is the best
[3:07:28] <%chiazam> DOOM
[3:07:28] <penitentpentwitch> Every enemy your bounce touches gets Doom
[3:07:29] <MisterArcanine> doom
[3:07:30] <reonome> both are good
[3:07:30] <+CourageTheCat> DO OO O M
[3:07:30] <jeffishype> RAGE
[3:07:30] <%AzureGale> DOOM ETERNAL
[3:07:30] <%Tearonex> ALWAYS DOOM
[3:07:31] <%FacetiousAF> TRUST YOURSELF
[3:07:33] <+Tonystarx90> battle rage tho
[3:07:33] <Morbidmort> DOOOOOOOM
[3:07:34] <%Typhaeon> Battle Rage will not help against bosses though
[3:07:35] <+FlubbedPig> Shield bounce with Doom is good
[3:07:37] <+pectusumbra> doom is good. Battle rage is kind of finiky
[3:07:38] <CrystalLightPeachTea> IT'S DOUBLE DAMAGE
[3:07:38] <%bevyrage> 1 helps against bosses
[3:07:38] <%FacetiousAF> trust yourself
[3:07:38] <%Saltmeisterr> doom is eternal pay
[3:07:39] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt if you whiff it you lose the battle rage
[3:07:40] <tolloponik> Rage
[3:07:42] <chocobodundee> DUSK
[3:07:43] <+pectusumbra> because it will wiff
[3:07:44] <%weissguard> Rip & TEAR! Until Zagreus has seen Persephone.
[3:07:53] <+queaks> both were good
[3:07:54] <%misha_kastrilevich> Battle rage
[3:07:54] <+Jaysky> [heavy metal stops]
[3:07:55] <%blastyoboots> a hundred damage for one bouncing shield is p incredible. and battle rage is only gonna net you about 35 extra damage every once in a while as opposed to 100
[3:07:58] <%SWFanatic> RageStaresAt
[3:08:03] <MisterArcanine> I mean each boss does have adds so its useful
[3:08:07] <Morbidmort> Battle rage is temporary, but DOOM IS ETERNAL
[3:08:12] <%SWFanatic> ! Life at Risk !
[3:08:12] <MisterArcanine> but not as consistent
[3:08:15] <+NickyDynamite> Battle rage depends on the weapon
[3:08:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Return of AngriestPat
[3:08:22] <penitentpentwitch> The problem with battle rage in this build: His dash is likely to eat the buff
[3:08:27] <%Saltmeisterr> @Morbidmort u mother fucker
[3:08:33] <$autcetera> Y'all debating Battle Rage vs Doom as if he's going to survive Asph
[3:08:45] <%bevyrage> yeah, battle rage on deflection runs is a bit meh
[3:08:50] <+Tonystarx90> lmaooo
[3:08:52] <%Saltmeisterr> wait did pat pick doom?
[3:09:00] <+TylerRich117> this game looks like the tits! love Supergiant!!!
[3:09:01] <+NickyDynamite> No
[3:09:01] <Vashido22> no
[3:09:03] <Vashido22> battle rage
[3:09:04] <%bevyrage> he took the buff on kills
[3:09:09] <penitentpentwitch> @Saltmeisterr He picked battle rage
[3:09:12] <OperatorJo_> oh Pat.
[3:09:13] <Grandma_Amari> DooM will never steer you wrong
[3:09:17] <%Saltmeisterr> damn
[3:09:21] <penitentpentwitch> Food!
[3:09:22] <aeonicvector> nah battle rage is great, but your low on hP
[3:09:23] <%CrematedCube> ?
[3:09:28] <%chiazam> What's in the bag?
[3:09:28] <penitentpentwitch> Red Zagreus needs food badly
[3:09:29] <Morbidmort> Heal, my man
[3:09:29] <Valentinius_Anodyne> We always are, except when we're not :)
[3:09:31] <aeonicvector> so you cant take as many risks
[3:09:32] <%bevyrage> doom is also super good after you break through this zone
[3:09:33] <%Tearonex> Hydra gunna kill him
[3:09:35] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> its not like you dont get to respec every time you die
[3:09:37] <TurtlesAndTentacles> that's on you not listening

[3:09:40] <$autcetera> vineMortis

[3:10:30] <$autcetera> I stand correct! He can do this!
[3:10:36] <%SWFanatic> In time you will know the extent of my failings
[3:10:38] <+NickyDynamite> Has pat not touched this game yet?
[3:10:41] <%hypermike88> hypermike88 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak!

[3:11:06] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> arrows are great at this boss
[3:11:13] <%FacetiousAF> gyro sounds bomb
[3:11:14] <%chiazam> Oh he hasn't even seen Calls in this save
[3:11:15] <Vashido22> remember when this fight took fucking forever?
[3:11:21] <+NickyDynamite> The arrows seem to be always good
[3:11:23] <MisterArcanine> the Elysian boss fight feels way stronger now
[3:11:30] <$autcetera> vineMortis vineMortis
[3:11:31] <penitentpentwitch> Lernie wins!

[3:11:35] <Vashido22> BONK
[3:11:35] <%afronooch> rip
[3:11:35] <SomeAsianDood> remember when there were health pickups in this fight LUL
[3:11:36] <MisterArcanine> They give them so much more health and i'm like omg why
[3:11:37] <%bevyrage> i remember seeing speedruns of the hydra fight that still took 4 minutes
[3:11:37] <%chiazam> @Typhaeon Lasts forever?
[3:11:39] <%l3sovikk> Lernie's tough the first few times
[3:11:39] <OperatorJo_> F

[3:11:40] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> D:
[3:11:41] <VritraReiRei> yeah, 2 updates ago they made it 3 phases down from 4
[3:11:45] <+CourageTheCat> Clonk
[3:11:47] <donkymagooterson> never played this - are there no healing items in this game?
[3:11:47] <madmurl0c> What's Hades actually about
[3:11:50] <madmurl0c> Also, cat cat
[3:11:57] <%FacetiousAF> dusa PogChamp <3

[3:12:15] <+BrogorkTheFork> Bone that Hydra Pay
[3:12:26] <blitzmentalist> DOG
[3:12:28] <VritraReiRei> @donkymagooterson there are but they drop rarely. there are other ways to heal but it's not too common
[3:12:35] <+Tonystarx90> i bet dusa can give some good neck amirite >:]
[3:12:38] <+NickyDynamite> There’s healing fountains occasionally and items you can buy to temporarily make enemies drop health, and sometimes you can buy health restores. Lot of randomness.
[3:12:45] <Grandma_Amari> TAKE PUPPER WITH
[3:12:45] <donkymagooterson> thanks @VritraReiRei
[3:12:46] <%bevyrage> @donkymagooterson there are healing items but they're super rare and tend to be pretty weak in potency. you can boost your health with buffs, and visit a spa but they have to be built so no good healing methods by default
[3:12:54] <%za7az> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[3:12:55] <+Jaysky> For now
[3:13:00] <MisterArcanine> Pat should collect gems so he can get the dungeon upgrades they are so useful
[3:13:06] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt give Hades an ambrosia
[3:13:13] <%afronooch> i still cant get over how rad these designs are

[3:13:46] <%notgarza> psaDogchamp
[3:13:56] <1MadLadd> why u have to be mad hades, it's just a game

[3:14:00] <%Tearonex> Fated list is way more worth
[3:14:01] <%FacetiousAF> fated list 👀
[3:14:02] <MisterArcanine> The list is resources fountain
[3:14:03] <%bevyrage> fated list can net him some resources but pretty sure he hasn't unlocked any of htem
[3:14:04] <%chiazam> It was fated to happen
[3:14:09] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> you just unlocked a highly addictive upgrade tree, congrats
[3:14:16] <penitentpentwitch> I just like the major selling point of this game could be summarized as "Screw you dad, I do what I want!"
[3:14:23] <%GohanHitsugaya> It is.
[3:14:26] <ElectricHoodie> it is tho
[3:14:28] <%LouieRouie> It is actually

[3:15:15] <SomeAsianDood> One of them basically goes "At least I got some good hits right?"
[3:15:18] <%SovPho> In an RPG situation, do we prefer speechboxes like this or like how a classical JRPG would do them?
[3:15:19] <%Chimeraelite> I don't really blame Hades tbh considering he's the only responsible one of his siblings. They all fuck off and do whatever
[3:15:21] <Oxybe> Yubi yubi

[3:19:23] <+Jaysky> Have confidence!
[3:19:26] <penitentpentwitch> Remember, you can switch items mid run, so you can start with Chthonic Purse and switch to Collar/Tooth next run

[3:31:43] <%weissguard> And then along CAME ZEUS!
[3:31:59] <%linSP> do it again
[3:32:02] <@SoFarFetched> and then he does
[3:32:03] <+wolfofsound> the floor is lava ones are easier once you beat the furies enough times, then the weird ones trip ya
[3:32:06] <+JonJonRequiem> And he's over it lol
[3:32:07] <the_vainglory> Oh hey, this just left Early Access, I keep hearing good things about it.
[3:32:11] <%AzureGale> "I just tried to kill you but let's move past that okay"
[3:32:12] <braincraft> SPURNED
[3:32:16] <%bevyrage> 1
[3:32:18] <LordOfThePoultry> 1
[3:32:19] <%chiazam> This is all bad
[3:32:21] <%SWFanatic> 1
[3:32:21] <penitentpentwitch> I like Jolted
[3:32:21] <%SharkMissile> psa2guy
[3:32:22] <KaiserMario> Jolted is good...
[3:32:22] <%Saltmeisterr> jolted for status curse
[3:32:22] <%za7az> 2
[3:32:23] <+JonJonRequiem> 1
[3:32:24] <+wolfofsound> 1
[3:32:25] <braincraft> Which is worse, spurning or scorning?
[3:32:26] <%preeeow> 6th run on a clean save just beat it:)
[3:32:28] <+mostbrokenrobo> DASH DASH DASH
[3:32:31] <artificiallynatural> 1 or 2
[3:32:32] <tattleworm> 2
[3:32:32] <%linSP> i never get jolt to proc
[3:32:37] <%Tearonex> 1
[3:32:39] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> 1 or 2
[3:32:40] <IminyourBase> 2
[3:32:41] <VritraReiRei> I dont think he has the Status Curse yet?
[3:32:42] <RushUnplugged> any dash
[3:32:43] <+wolfofsound> jolted would be good if he had zooz on attack
[3:32:44] <Oxybe> zipzapzoop
[3:32:46] <IminyourBase> 2 is your cast
[3:32:47] <RushUnplugged> just free damage on dash
[3:32:47] <%Monkeyweed21> dash them doors
[3:32:50] <tattleworm> a lot of later boons can proc off of jolted
[3:32:50] <Morbidmort> Your cast works with that
[3:32:52] <%Tearonex> choas
[3:32:54] <%Saltmeisterr> CHAOS REIGNS
[3:32:55] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> decent choice
[3:32:55] <%Tearonex> MORE CHOAS
[3:32:55] <penitentpentwitch> Mmm, the greed
[3:32:56] <Oxybe> JUMP
[3:32:58] <%Tearonex> WOooooooooo
[3:32:58] <penitentpentwitch> Good
[3:33:01] <%Ne1son> Yes Daddy Chaos
[3:33:03] <zazzera01> @linSP jolt procs when enemies attack after hitting them
[3:33:04] <%za7az> good choice
[3:33:04] <Ids560> reminder that this curse will probably be for meg
[3:33:04] <Morbidmort> CHAOS TIME
[3:33:04] <%bevyrage> jolted requires the enemy to be near someone while they attack. it's good way later on when you're getting swarmed but it otherwise isn't that helpful
[3:33:07] <%Daniel_Is_I> CHAOS CHAOS
[3:33:13] <%SWFanatic> Heeeey kiiid. Wanna see some magic?
[3:33:14] <LordOfThePoultry> C H A O S
[3:33:15] <+wolfofsound> chaos is my favorite design
[3:33:26] <OperatorJo_> Chaos is happy with this run
[3:33:26] <tattleworm> welcome to the chaos garden
[3:33:27] <%Saltmeisterr> 3
[3:33:31] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> chaos is always worth it early on, unless there's a hammer to get; laqter on the challenges are a lot harder
[3:33:32] <penitentpentwitch> As a person who has stupided himself into 10 HP going into a boss fight, CHAOS REIGNS
[3:33:36] <CrystalLightPeachTea> This sounds like Chaos is the narrator, since he's talking him up a lot
[3:33:36] <aeonicvector> 1s GREAT
[3:33:41] <%Saltmeisterr> 3 is easy
[3:33:42] <VritraReiRei> 2 is good
[3:33:44] <penitentpentwitch> Pauper is actually great
[3:33:45] <%SWFanatic> 1
[3:33:47] <%bevyrage> first one is solid for resource building
[3:33:48] <%DetroitSentai> 1 is great tho
[3:33:48] <Morbidmort> Remember, no special
[3:33:53] <+wolfofsound> @cereal_box_conspiracy hammers will always show up later so don't prioritize them
[3:33:53] <aeonicvector> good for "i wont win" runs
[3:33:55] <%Daniel_Is_I> 1 is good if you're later in the game
[3:34:00] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt they aren't if you're trying to farm gems
[3:34:05] <1MadLadd> porn power?
[3:34:20] <@SoFarFetched> poor meg
[3:34:23] <%bevyrage> what? @Daniel_Is_I 1 is better the earlier you get it in a run, and it pays forward to future runs
[3:34:26] <%Daniel_Is_I> If you're late enough that you've beaten the game multiple times, pauper's is fantastic
[3:34:32] <SomeAsianDood> the fight fucking is real
[3:34:34] <RushUnplugged> the flirt SO much
[3:34:38] <FrostedZaibatsu> Her voice is fucking Kreygasm
[3:34:42] <%Daniel_Is_I> Later in the GAME bevy
[3:34:42] <%Typhaeon> Man she is the best
[3:34:44] <%Ranryu692> Don't be mean to Lernie psaPat
[3:34:49] <%Daniel_Is_I> When you get gems from multiple bosses
[3:34:56] <the_vainglory> This looks RAD.
[3:34:58] <penitentpentwitch> The Poke Hard Counter
[3:35:04] <+wolfofsound> @Daniel_Is_I also that new update gives you more
[3:35:05] <%linSP> aw god this game is constantly gushing
[3:35:07] <Sundaysmiles01> I mean, Dusa is up there, but I'm growing on Meg
[3:35:14] <+JonJonRequiem> Long deflect busted
[3:35:16] <%SovPho> This background music sounds like Separate Ways by Journey lmao
[3:35:24] <%Saltmeisterr> EASY
[3:35:29] <+FlubbedPig> Christ that deflect damage
[3:35:29] <%chiazam> that was quick
[3:35:33] <+JonJonRequiem> Sheesh...
[3:35:34] <%SWFanatic> rekt
[3:35:36] <Oxybe> long deflect is hilarious
[3:35:39] <IminyourBase> took so much dmg tho
[3:35:40] <1MadLadd> deflect was doing so much damage LUL
[3:35:46] <donkymagooterson> no match for the long shaft
[3:35:47] <RushUnplugged> Deflect is consistently the strongest thing in the game, even after nerfs lol
[3:35:48] <Sundaysmiles01> uh oh
[3:35:53] <%bevyrage> pretty sure we'll see a rotation after next run
[3:35:54] <Sundaysmiles01> Meg's in a spot of bother
[3:36:00] <$tuifuiegoeris> Hullo pat
[3:36:03] <Ozavic> Hey Pat and Chat and Cat, this game is good, I'm glad you seem to be enjoying it
[3:36:15] <Grandma_Amari> How many floors are there?
[3:36:17] <braincraft> Anything that lets you defend and attack at the same time is great.
[3:36:20] <$tuifuiegoeris> Elmo is backseating
[3:36:21] <%Saltmeisterr> time
[3:36:22] <+wolfofsound> @PatStaresAt it'll make a sound
[3:36:23] <@StridentSong> The icon changes
[3:36:23] <Ids560> it has a counter
[3:36:25] <penitentpentwitch> It's listed on the boon
[3:36:26] <Ozavic> It will tell you @PatStaresAt
[3:36:26] <%AzureGale> Number below it
[3:36:29] <%Saltmeisterr> timer at the bottom pat
[3:36:30] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> it will tell you
[3:36:32] <Ids560> it's 3 fights
[3:36:34] <%Ranryu692> the icon changes, and it makes a noise
[3:36:36] <Ids560> not including troves
[3:36:37] <%Tearonex> Bosses don't count towards the timer
[3:36:37] <SomeAsianDood> 4 stages. ~75 flooors @Grandma_Amari
[3:36:38] <Sundaysmiles01> Elmo demands backseat scritches
[3:36:39] <%SovPho> how freaked out would SuperGiant fans be if they made a game that was omnidirectionally isometric
[3:36:40] <%linSP> mmm chraos
[3:36:40] <popcultureaficionado> 4 floors apperently.
[3:36:41] <+jjjkopf> an encounter has to ahve enemies
[3:36:42] <@StridentSong> Yea, it only counts encounters that involve fights
[3:36:45] <%bevyrage> shop rooms don't count towards it. you have to clear hazardous rooms, trove encounters, etc
[3:37:01] <%SWFanatic> here I am uncle moe while you eat
[3:37:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> here I am uncle moe, while you eat
[3:37:07] <Ozavic> "My Chaos boon has evolved a new effect" or something like that
[3:37:09] <%Saltmeisterr> SPEED
[3:37:12] <penitentpentwitch> You have to be careful with Chaos Boons. Some expire 'Per Number of Rooms' some expire 'Per Number of Encounters'
[3:37:21] <Bigyanno> HERmes? What about HISmes?
[3:37:24] <aeonicvector> vtw GIVE HERMES SOME SODA
[3:37:27] <aeonicvector> his is really good
[3:37:33] <popcultureaficionado> fuck yeah
[3:37:41] <@StridentSong> The ones that affect Rewards (hiding them) are Per room. The ones that fuck up your abilities are Per Encounter
[3:37:41] <%SovPho> @Bigyanno #notallmes
[3:37:45] <%Ranryu692> WAIT SINCE WHEN DOES IT SAY THE CHAMBER NUMBER IN THE UPPER CORNER???
[3:37:51] <%CrematedCube> I just noticed it now tells you the room number on the top now
[3:37:58] <@StridentSong> And he doesn't always say the Chaos Boon evolved line unfortunately. The sound does play every time though
[3:38:04] <+wolfofsound> attack!
[3:38:14] <cobalt_phoenix_> SPEEEEED BOOST
[3:38:18] <tolloponik> Become a GUN
[3:38:19] <%chiazam> @Ranryu692 Didnt it always?
[3:38:21] <braincraft> I love all the tiny effects from each boon.
[3:38:25] <+wolfofsound> no money*
[3:38:25] <Bigyanno> Could you though?
[3:38:25] <%SovPho> We as a society have decided that Disney's epiction of Hermes is correct and it propagates.
[3:38:28] <%SWFanatic> gotta go chili dog
[3:38:29] <braincraft> You can see little feathers when you stab now.
[3:38:34] <+wolfofsound> baby pom

[3:39:09] <+wolfofsound> this mini boss is pretty easy with this build LUL
[3:39:09] <%Ranryu692> @chiazam I put 102 hours into this game in the past 3 months and never noticed lol

[3:39:31] <cobalt_phoenix_> holy shit 3 sounds insane
[3:39:31] <+JonJonRequiem> 3
[3:39:34] <RushUnplugged> 2 and 3 are both real good
[3:39:37] <Meekest> Always prophecies
[3:39:38] <+wolfofsound> it's good for bosses and mini bosses
[3:39:43] <$RealThiele> 3 doesnt work on bosses tho
[3:39:51] <GenericTwitchAcc1> do we even have any doom applier?
[3:39:54] <cobalt_phoenix_> ah
[3:39:58] <aeonicvector> 3 is good, but his build dosent oneshot alot at this mirror level
[3:40:01] <RushUnplugged> it does if they have minions, and almost all do
[3:40:16] <+wolfofsound> I said 2 was good for that
[3:40:25] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt You can use your special again

[3:48:03] <$RealThiele> chaos is paige cause she steals your health
[3:48:04] <%linSP> it took me three runs to beat the game
[3:48:05] <%bevyrage> @Mendin bull of minos is the furthest he's gotten
[3:48:08] <%Chimeraelite> Far in "progress" but not in completion.
[3:48:08] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt his trinket lets you in without the health loss
[3:48:09] <+wolfofsound> choosing chaos in Elysium ........ballsy
[3:48:13] <+JonJonRequiem> Gud job
[3:48:13] <%Saltmeisterr> grasp it up
[3:48:13] <penitentpentwitch> Third one is the least Debuffing
[3:48:14] <tolloponik> 2 or 3
[3:48:14] <%Ranryu692> we'll see what Asterius has to say about that
[3:48:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Well, you do have the Orb, so of course you're baller
[3:48:17] <%Typhaeon> That first one is so terrible
[3:48:18] <Sundaysmiles01> No Risk. No Reward
[3:48:19] <LordOfThePoultry> 3
[3:48:28] <penitentpentwitch> The second one actually reduces I-frames on dodge
[3:48:31] <+JonJonRequiem> 1 is so awful

[3:49:56] <$RealThiele> red crystals are bloodstone which are darts that cause debuffs and other effects based on spec
[3:50:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots Fun Fact: The guy who made the soundtrack is also the VA for the protagonist
[3:50:03] <%bevyrage> @devanmuse red crystals are casts, which are what lets him use certain abilities. unless you're talking about the egg looking ones, those explode

[4:01:43] <PerrinGoldeneyes> f
[4:01:43] <@SoFarFetched> that was a pretty good first run of that boss
[4:01:44] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt They're probably the hardest boss in the game
[4:01:44] <SomeAsianDood> good try
[4:01:44] <aretos1> theseus is the fucking worst
[4:01:44] <penitentpentwitch> Also, Theseus is a salty winner
[4:01:45] <%SWFanatic> thats tough
[4:01:45] <tolloponik> so close
[4:01:45] <%waltzqueen> RIP
[4:01:45] <$Teh_Un> F
[4:01:46] <%bevyrage> one of my favorite fights in the game
[4:01:47] <+cappyd33> good job
[4:01:47] <donkymagooterson> it was fate
[4:01:47] <sanslogic> f for fuck that guy
[4:01:48] <OperatorJo_> oof great run tho
[4:01:48] <BeNiceImShy> Y'know, considering that's a first attempt, coulda been worse
[4:01:48] <Captain_Joe1911> cakee5Tuntun
[4:01:50] <+lordericter> Dang losing to Theseus blows
[4:01:51] <%chiazam> Get Theseus'd
[4:01:53] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Good try though
[4:01:53] <%FacetiousAF> that shit is ROUGH for a while
[4:01:53] <$ButtStuff_n_CoffeePots> Oh well
[4:01:54] <%Ranryu692> I walked away, was that the real boss or just Asterius?
[4:01:54] <leinadtonu> that looks difficult
[4:01:56] <%Reaped_Psyche> Damn good run while it lasted.
[4:01:57] <lordzaskez> now imagine the harder version
[4:01:58] <leinadtonu> but cool
[4:02:00] <%I_chose_Rapture> I_chose_Rapture subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Woo almost 2 years!
[4:02:00] <Jflaskd13> rip
[4:02:01] <+bobocrunch1> is this a harder difficulty? mobs seem pretty tanky in this
[4:02:02] <%linSP> orensteen and smoff
[4:02:02] <$realm_forge> Good run tho
[4:02:02] <braincraft> You did okay, you just got to a new boss with low health. Probably should have gone to the shop for healing.
[4:02:04] <%Saraceal> Pretty good try tbh
[4:02:05] <RushUnplugged> for sure the biggest hurdle to pass on the first runs
[4:02:07] <penitentpentwitch> Oof
[4:02:07] <sanslogic> thanks hypnos
[4:02:10] <SomeAsianDood> goddamnit hypnos
[4:02:12] <+lazysaiyajin> ha

[4:02:28] <%YakumoYomi> Your ship sucks, Theseus!
[4:02:34] <%Mendin> MUTHER
[4:02:35] <%Daniel_Is_I> I can't tell if Hypnos is savage or just stupid
[4:02:37] <%AzureGale> STEALTH BURN
[4:02:37] <%Ranryu692> Speaking of minotaurs, I really hope we get to fight one in the Miles Morales game
[4:02:38] <GenericTwitchAcc1> BibleThump
[4:02:39] <penitentpentwitch> I think the strongest point of this game is that a 'loss' is still 'rewarded' by plot progression. So it doesn't feel that bad.
[4:02:47] <andresisant> Theseus it's an asshole
[4:02:47] <SomeAsianDood> yes @Daniel_Is_I
[4:02:51] <$RealThiele> stepmom i broke my arms
[4:02:55] <%FacetiousAF> OH YEAH

[4:03:01] <%Saltmeisterr> its supergiant
[4:03:01] <BeNiceImShy> Oh it's barely even begun
[4:03:03] <%Chimeraelite> fuck
[4:03:04] <+wolfofsound> they added a shit ton on this last update
[4:03:04] <%SovPho> *coughroguelite*
[4:03:06] <%Tearonex> the story is awesome in this game
[4:03:08] <%Mendin> Thaaaaaaaaaaaaat's Supergiant!
[4:03:10] <%Saltmeisterr> story is what they do
[4:03:10] <kingra> It's a good rougelike
[4:03:11] <RushUnplugged> no run is "wasted", it's very rewarding
[4:03:15] <%FacetiousAF> cerberus deserves a treat
[4:03:20] <@SoFarFetched> its true
[4:03:26] <%CrematedCube> Chat is a curse
[4:03:26] <%Saraceal> Mom and Dad no please
[4:03:27] <%ElkRiverDog> Pet dog
[4:03:28] <%Ranryu692> I put in over 100 hours and still hadn't heard all of it, and then they added 3000 more lines today
[4:03:29] <popcultureaficionado> BIG STORY
[4:03:31] <%chiazam> Fountains
[4:03:32] <%za7az> psaGiefrail
[4:03:33] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt every patch they add like, 3000 new voice lines and they have done that MULTIPLE times. So. much. dialogue.
[4:03:33] <donkymagooterson> go pet the demon dog
[4:03:33] <tattleworm> there's so much dialogue that they even removed from some from the game because it related to early access lore
[4:03:34] <%FacetiousAF> Fountains
[4:03:37] <Edtango> This is barely the tip, there's so much lore to be found
[4:03:38] <sanslogic> the top one!
[4:03:40] <Morbidmort> Goald
[4:03:41] <LordOfThePoultry> 1
[4:03:41] <%Ranryu692> Urn money!
[4:03:41] <RushUnplugged> you get story, you get currencies, upgrades etc, it's never a waste even if you die
[4:03:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> Not a roguelike, it's a roguelite.
[4:03:47] <andresisant> Nyx has big Ara Ara energy jajaja
[4:03:49] <CrystalLightPeachTea> What are the upgrades for the Great Hall & Lounge about?
[4:03:54] <%SovPho> omg i love contractor ghost
[4:03:56] <%iamnolionheart> Underworld construction efforts and all that
[4:04:04] <Grandma_Amari> Oh god I just noticed those are ghosts with hard hats
[4:04:04] <%Mendin> Never not pet dog
[4:04:04] <$RealThiele> most upgrades are fashion
[4:04:06] <$Teh_Un> Pet that doggo
[4:04:10] <%Ranryu692> @CrystalLightPeachTea aesthetic changes
[4:04:10] <SomeAsianDood> mainly cosmetic. Though they work for fated list @CrystalLightPeachTea
[4:04:17] <%ElkRiverDog> coxHypers coxHypers coxHypers
[4:04:26] <CrystalLightPeachTea> alright
[4:04:34] <+wolfofsound> @PatStaresAt They added more than 3,000 new voice lines for this version 1 patch
[4:04:34] <$RealThiele> hot lore
[4:04:40] <sanslogic> stab them in their pride
[4:04:45] <$RealThiele> BOILED LORE VAPORS
[4:04:45] <%AzureGale> Pride is one of the seven deadly sins
[4:04:45] <VritraReiRei> @CrystalLightPeachTea most is cosmetic, one is the soundtrack, but some are help you in future runs.
[4:04:46] <turf_wind_and_fire> Seriously, I can't get over how gorgeous this game is
[4:04:51] <Make_me_mad> Achilles telling anyone they're too prideful is a hoot.
[4:04:53] <%SovPho> Wait can you make the minotaur run into achilles?
[4:04:54] <%Daniel_Is_I> Their Achilles' Heel, if you will
[4:04:57] <penitentpentwitch> You can pay to repair it
[4:04:57] <%SovPho> err theseus
[4:04:59] <butthurtdave> Hey Pat, did you see the Dragon's Dogma anime yet?
[4:05:01] <%SharkMissile> Where's Dusa? psaGib
[4:05:09] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt check the trader, he has some good deals occasionally
[4:05:16] <GenericTwitchAcc1> dorkness
[4:05:19] <%AzureGale> Kingdom Hearts... is LIGHT
[4:05:19] <lucas18293> how far has pat gotten now
[4:05:20] <%FacetiousAF> man dusa's great
[4:05:31] <%Saraceal> Darkness is Power
[4:05:36] <Morbidmort> Key
[4:05:37] <eldritchmouse> It's Theseus not Achilles
[4:05:38] <%chiazam> Always check
[4:05:40] <%Daniel_Is_I> @lucas18293 Theseus + Minotaur
[4:05:44] <%Mendin> 100 gems for a diamond is really good actually.
[4:05:45] <$RealThiele> holy shit its pouring rain here guys
[4:05:49] <%Saltmeisterr> unlock le fist
[4:05:50] <lucas18293> ooh
[4:05:52] <Maleicus> blood and darkness
[4:05:52] <%za7az> Well it is a good deal
[4:05:54] <%Mendin> well, decently good
[4:05:54] <penitentpentwitch> The Trader has a 'daily deal' that changes every run. So it's never a bad idea to check.
[4:05:55] <+remdiel> Hah! Patrick! We meet again, you buffoon! XD
[4:06:07] <+remdiel> is this 1.0?
[4:06:11] <%linSP> skelly's talking about your dick
[4:06:13] <braincraft> Theseus is basically the same as Achilles, if you replace every bit of him with another guy.
[4:06:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> The real Kingdom Hearts was the friends we made on the way.
[4:06:15] <butthurtdave> oh shit did they add new weapons?
[4:06:17] <$RealThiele> yea hades 1.0
[4:06:18] <%Typhaeon> Buy an RTX 3090, cehck

[4:07:06] <%Broand> Woo I just beat my first game of Hades
[4:07:06] <Morbidmort> poison time
[4:07:08] <rbakervv> shot is amazing
[4:07:08] <%Daniel_Is_I> 2 is good
[4:07:09] <penitentpentwitch> It stacks to 5 base
[4:07:15] <%CrematedCube> Hah, they changed 'poison' to 'hangover'
[4:07:16] <aretos1> fog is insane
[4:07:16] <penitentpentwitch> It's great for quick hitting weapons
[4:07:17] <%mike2hands> seriosly man what up with tha you know im so chad in here you didnt even know dude
[4:07:20] <aretos1> especially at start
[4:07:21] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt 3 synergies with a LOT of boons
[4:07:23] <butthurtdave> attack seems best since you'll be using it the most?
[4:07:25] <lucas18293> 2 and 3 are both good
[4:07:27] <%Saltmeisterr> @SomeAsianDood ah thanks. i was wondering what the trigger is
[4:07:28] <$RealThiele> fog is insane but cast is meh
[4:07:30] <%Broand> Using two Dual blessings
[4:07:32] <+spacetaost> how long has Pat been paying??
[4:07:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> Drunken Strike seems like the best choice
[4:07:37] <VritraReiRei> @butthurtdave what was the last weapon you saw they added, they added quite a few over the past few patches. also different types of each weapon
[4:07:39] <+zzNamttamzz> it's festive
[4:07:45] <%bevyrage> !uptime
[4:07:46] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 7m.
[4:07:48] <%chiazam> I think that cast is one of the two worst ones
[4:07:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> @spacetaost He's been streaming for 4 hours
[4:07:53] <%bevyrage> ah damn
[4:07:54] <$RealThiele> the time loss on launching those is bleh
[4:07:54] <SomeAsianDood> @Saltmeisterr hard to meet snow mama until zag knows what snow is
[4:07:54] <%Saltmeisterr> @VritraReiRei fist

[4:08:07] <%SWFanatic> Cheer500 Thanks for the great stream. Gotta sleep. Have a good one.
[4:08:12] <Maleicus> its an ok cast imo
[4:08:15] <lucas18293> poms upgrade the cast damage by a lot
[4:08:16] <%MelBrooksKA> Pat has become the clucker
[4:08:21] <+spacetaost> @rumtumtugnutz thanks
[4:08:30] <$RealThiele> personally im not a cast fan at all
[4:08:37] <+remdiel> How to make a game like this when you have no talent, knowledge or money wait this is not google
[4:08:47] <+mechslayer71> Has pat beaten it yet?
[4:08:48] <%Saltmeisterr> the stun is good too
[4:08:48] <%Saraceal> So I’ve been at drug rehabs like all year and now I’m at a halfway it feels so good to be back on this
[4:08:51] <CrystalLightPeachTea> So, are the Hammers permanent upgrades to each weapon?
[4:08:52] <RushUnplugged> the cast also has a stun so it's pretty good
[4:08:54] <%chiazam> @RealThiele but the buff
[4:09:08] <SomeAsianDood> just a run upgrade CrystalLightPeachTea
[4:09:11] <+mechslayer71> @crystallightpeachtea no, just for the run
[4:09:13] <penitentpentwitch> @CrystalLightPeachTea They last the run
[4:09:15] <$RealThiele> yea i know its really good and thats what i end with with
[4:09:16] <CrystalLightPeachTea> right
[4:09:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @remdiel Take the time to get the knowledge and talent

[4:13:15] <ancrest_tant> Big scary boi
[4:13:15] <%LouieRouie> He understands
[4:13:17] <%AzureGale> Zagreus is running away
[4:13:18] <Maleicus> my favorite person bouldy
[4:13:19] <%linSP> he's a broseidon
[4:13:19] <penitentpentwitch> This is absolutely chillest version of him
[4:13:19] <Mr_Strut> The dude with the boulder
[4:13:20] <%Saltmeisterr> no he's a king
[4:13:20] <%Broand> now get more zeus buffs so your lightning hits do more cool stuff
[4:13:21] <+wolfofsound> he was a king..........
[4:13:22] <+mechslayer71> Duos have been a thing for a while
[4:13:22] <Morbidmort> He's learned his lesson then
[4:13:22] <+remdiel> not a deity at all
[4:13:23] <Mr_Strut> Also he was a king
[4:13:24] <%CrematedCube> He tied Death to a tree one time
[4:13:27] <$RealThiele> him and prometheus
[4:13:29] <%Chimeraelite> He's just a boulder dude.
[4:13:34] <%Nekros4442> Sisiphyus was a mortal that's cursed to push a boulder up a hill only to do it again once he does
[4:13:34] <SomeAsianDood> I mean he's been doing this for a couple centuries of course he's chill at this point
[4:13:35] <Grandma_Amari> Sisyphus looks swole as fuck, but that's to be expected
[4:13:36] <%Saltmeisterr> health
[4:13:37] <waltzqueen> SYSPHUS Was a dick and totally earned what he got
[4:13:38] <%bevyrage> HEAL
[4:13:39] <%kyh9> Did you ever get the summons?
[4:13:39] <%Chimeraelite> Well known, but boulder
[4:13:40] <%Saltmeisterr> hp
[4:13:41] <sanslogic> nah he was a mortal king who pissed off all the gods and got the worst punishment
[4:13:42] <aretos1> cash
[4:13:42] <%NovaKnightmare> He fed the gods his son
[4:13:42] <%CrematedCube> Death wasn't happy about that
[4:13:43] <lucas18293> heal
[4:13:44] <Meekest> He was the guy who put Thanatos in a sock drawer
[4:13:45] <Morbidmort> heal
[4:13:46] <%tanarath> $ or darkness
[4:13:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> Sisyphus was the one that ripped off one of the gods and had to push a rock up a hill for eternity, right?
[4:13:48] <+lazysaiyajin> money heals man
[4:13:48] <%averyoddjew> darkness
[4:13:48] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt He's cursed to forever roll boulder up a cliff, that always rolls down
[4:13:49] <%Monkeyweed21> heal your money
[4:13:50] <$RealThiele> money
[4:13:51] <%SovPho> @RealThiele No, Prometheus was a lesser god
[4:13:53] <+its_a_mimic> nope
[4:13:53] <LordOfThePoultry> heal
[4:13:53] <braincraft> Sisyphus literally does nothing but lift all day.
[4:13:55] <+wolfofsound> @waltzqueen totally, they touch on it in the game
[4:13:56] <$RealThiele> can buy heal
[4:13:56] <lucas18293> you need health
[4:13:57] <%kyh9> Sisyphus? He's the king who was forced to push the boulder up forever
[4:13:58] <Morbidmort> gyro and fries
[4:13:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> I want a gyro
[4:14:00] <%Broand> geero
[4:14:01] <JaseAdrift> PET ROCK
[4:14:02] <%Ne1son> Yee-Ro
[4:14:03] <%Aztec50> Sisyphus has to push the bolder up the hill for eternity
[4:14:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Sisyphus was a king that cheated death so much that when he finally died, Hades forced him to eternally push a boulder up a hill to represent the futility of escaping death.
[4:14:03] <%Mendin> Hi Bouldy
[4:14:04] <%Agami23> he has to push the boulder up a hill endlessly. its where the term "sisyphian task" comes from
[4:14:04] <Grandma_Amari> Is that a fucking gyro and fries
[4:14:04] <%maskofmichael> Heal your money
[4:14:04] <%kyh9> monay
[4:14:05] <+pectusumbra> He was an asshole king that also tricked and imprisoned death. Also I just beat the game
[4:14:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt ITS PRONOUCED HERO
[4:14:07] <penitentpentwitch> I need a Gyro! Holding out for Gyro until the morning light~
[4:14:07] <%Mendin> bye Bouldy
[4:14:08] <%Typhaeon> Paige pronouncing words correctly?!
[4:14:08] <$RealThiele> i thought he was a tian not a god
[4:14:11] <1MadLadd> ah yes, my greek french fries and hamburger
[4:14:12] <popcultureaficionado> HEAL
[4:14:12] <%Chimeraelite> oh
[4:14:13] <SomeAsianDood> SHHHH don't think about potatoes existing at ancient greece yet
[4:14:15] <%Chimeraelite> OK
[4:14:23] <%mike2hands> that is so broken
[4:14:24] <%Aztec50> whenever he gets to the top it rolls back down
[4:14:27] <lucas18293> those provide a great defensive wall now
[4:14:28] <$RealThiele> ngl i also dont like survive maps
[4:14:33] <%Broand> Sisyphus's true punishment is that he's known for his punishment, rather than his deeds
[4:14:33] <%bevyrage> best thing about this cast is it can never get locked into enemies
[4:14:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @penitentpentwitch nobody does a proper Lamb gyro around here! allways beef and chicken
[4:14:36] <%waltzqueen> @wolfofsound hades in myth amost never punished anyone who didn't totally earn it
[4:14:36] <%linSP> that's some shocking fart gas
[4:14:40] <+pectusumbra> oh, pat got a duo boon, nice!
[4:14:41] <%TamsynRRD> A healro sandwich
[4:14:43] <ancrest_tant> That fart cloud is nuts
[4:14:43] <butthurtdave> does it stop at Duos or can it go to Trios and higher?
[4:14:52] <lucas18293> i love when you get dem, dio and zeus all in one run
[4:14:55] <SomeAsianDood> duos only
[4:14:56] <%bevyrage> only Duos
[4:15:01] <+mechslayer71> Wonder if he can run into than yet
[4:15:06] <%Mendin> A "Sisyphian Task" is a $10 term for one that is impossible
[4:15:07] <%Saltmeisterr> just duos
[4:15:11] <$RealThiele> chest!
[4:15:16] <+pectusumbra> no Duos are the top, but you can have multiple duos if they don't contridict
[4:15:21] <%Saltmeisterr> theres also legendary boons
[4:15:25] <Grandma_Amari> Watch Zagreus get to the surface and it's MODERN DAY.
[4:15:32] <%kyh9> quick asf
[4:15:38] <%kyh9> duo boons are the fucking best
[4:15:41] <RushUnplugged> also the rarity buffs them up a lot, a legendary duo is strong as hell
[4:15:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Mendin not impossible but endlessly difficult and repretitive
[4:15:43] <+pectusumbra> Man the fists feel so good. Fantastic for speed running
[4:15:44] <%bevyrage> MODERN DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!?
[4:15:47] <Frogwash> @Grandma_Amari Funny you should mention that
[4:15:51] <%GohanHitsugaya> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[4:15:55] <$RealThiele> the darkness buff option is so good
[4:16:06] <%Daniel_Is_I> Did they buff festive fog? I seem to remember it being worse than I played.
[4:16:10] <SomeAsianDood> I love the uppercut of the fists so much
[4:16:10] <%Saltmeisterr> looks like we got a cast build going
[4:16:19] <+wolfofsound> @pectusumbra yup they are my favorite, if you get the good hammer and hermes upgrades it's the best
[4:16:20] <SomeAsianDood> you can cancel a dash upper into a true upper it's insane
[4:16:31] <RushUnplugged> @Daniel_Is_I it's flat damage with stun now, but it doesn't stack poison anymore
[4:16:44] <butthurtdave> Is Pat that good or is that combo that broken
[4:16:53] <+pectusumbra> That works for you
[4:16:53] <%Broand> SICK
[4:16:54] <$RealThiele> meh
[4:16:56] <kingra> NICE
[4:16:56] <%mike2hands> YOOOOHHH

[4:17:02] <%FacetiousAF> FOOL
[4:17:04] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[4:17:10] <%Broand> it's temp but it's there
[4:17:11] <%tanarath> big number
[4:17:11] <%SovPho> Are the percentage buffs multiplicative?
[4:17:12] <%AzureGale> How to make things tempting: stick them in a mystery box
[4:17:12] <GenericTwitchAcc1> LUL
[4:17:14] <%DedlokPM> @butthurtdave rooYes
[4:17:14] <+pectusumbra> this game does a great job of the temp buffs really being worth it
[4:17:20] <$RealThiele> oogy boogey
[4:17:29] <%bevyrage> remember to hold attack to block hits incoming
[4:17:41] <+pectusumbra> I admit I like ice wine more but this is a good one

[4:19:27] <braincraft> She's like a pokemon, she can only say the one word.
[4:19:28] <@SoFarFetched> I died to her on my first try
[4:19:30] <Maxicqwe> she has a nice body
[4:19:30] <%FacetiousAF> the other one is the weird one
[4:19:34] <+wolfofsound> @Ranryu692 really? I find the other two easier

[4:22:24] <+pectusumbra> NOTE: LAVA COUNTS AS A TRAP
[4:22:24] <scrumbotime> Just don't step on spikes
[4:22:26] <butthurtdave> does lava count as trap
[4:22:29] <tranquilturnip> does lava count tho
[4:22:30] <lucas18293> pat needs to be tankier tbh

[4:22:38] <popcultureaficionado> 2
[4:22:41] <lucas18293> it does
[4:22:43] <%bevyrage> LAVA AND FIRE POOLS ARE GONNA BE TREATED AS TRAPS
[4:22:48] <GenericTwitchAcc1> lava counts as trap dmg, remember
[4:23:18] <%FacetiousAF> one more key
[4:23:25] <+lordericter> Sharon has wares if you have coin

[4:24:00] <Grandma_Amari> TAKE ME BY THE HAND
[4:24:10] <penitentpentwitch> Witch coven
[4:24:13] <$RealThiele> LUL
[4:24:14] <+wolfofsound> @lucas18293 they still can basically with heat
[4:24:14] <%FacetiousAF> i hate this room
[4:24:18] <LordOfThePoultry> THE HEALTH YOU FOOL
[4:24:19] <tranquilturnip> I find posidons boons to be the worst tbh
[4:24:22] <Dg10262> This is the most polished game I’ve ever seen.
[4:24:26] <$RealThiele> pride and accomplighment UP++
[4:24:33] <+mechslayer71> Poseidon is support, his offensive boons are largely trash
[4:24:41] <butthurtdave> OH NO
[4:24:43] <Grandma_Amari> Welp, run over
[4:24:44] <KaiserMario> OH, almost...
[4:24:47] <CrystalLightPeachTea> magic pixel
[4:24:50] <LegitBarnacleBoy> just put the shield up my dude
[4:24:50] <%bevyrage> his offensive boons are more on knockbacks and slams
[4:24:51] <%Saltmeisterr> MonkaS
[4:24:51] <penitentpentwitch> Wow
[4:24:52] <lucas18293> nice
[4:24:53] <VritraReiRei> 1 monkaS
[4:24:55] <+wolfofsound> poseidon is good for rupture and the wall stuns that's about it
[4:24:55] <%Mendin> Pat enemies take bonus damage when knocked back into the wall or a pit, Poseidon's KB is STRONK
[4:24:57] <GenericTwitchAcc1> 1
[4:24:59] <Morbidmort> HP BAYBEEE
[4:25:00] <$RealThiele> lava bath
[4:25:03] <%Tearonex> 1
[4:25:04] <+lazysaiyajin> shield up
[4:25:04] <aretos1> YES
[4:25:05] <%Saltmeisterr> 1
[4:25:06] <penitentpentwitch> Bouncy doom
[4:25:07] <%PR0swagonist> DOOM
[4:25:07] <lucas18293> 1.
[4:25:10] <lucas18293> so good
[4:25:12] <butthurtdave> watch your step
[4:25:13] <$RealThiele> DOOOOM
[4:25:14] <%iamnolionheart> Posideon's offense stuff really suffers from not being able to knock back bosses
[4:25:16] <GenericTwitchAcc1> DEWM
[4:25:21] <Grandma_Amari> Just don't get hit Kappa
[4:25:23] <%maskofmichael> Cheer500 Pat what would you do if one day Paige cut her hair super short and dyed blue?
[4:25:26] <+wolfofsound> oh god these guys
[4:25:30] <+pectusumbra> @mechslayer71 no way, poisdon does have fantastic boons. His cast is not bad, and the stuff that keys into knockback can get nuts like rupture
[4:25:54] <+pectusumbra> also those fucking guys, just doing the dark souls flail and IT WORKS
[4:25:59] <%Mendin> The final area can get absolutely comedic bumpercars if you've gone heavy poseidon
[4:26:00] <%bevyrage> poseidon's call is also one of hte best
[4:26:04] <tattleworm> poseidon and bow is how i beat max heat
[4:26:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat would fight the skeleton of kobe
[4:26:11] <RushUnplugged> I just saw the poseidon/ares cast duo, it's insane
[4:26:14] <butthurtdave> NAILED IT
[4:26:17] <lucas18293> health woo
[4:26:19] <%Saltmeisterr> shop pat
[4:26:19] <+wolfofsound> @Mendin yeah poseidon is great for the last area
[4:26:20] <%bevyrage> if you can just stick onto a boss during the full duration you can bypass phases
[4:26:20] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Transformed?

[4:53:58] <%AzureGale> CHOOSE YOUR NEXT DESTINY
[4:53:58] <%Piemono> You're looking for something
[4:54:00] <andresisant> use the fountain
[4:54:05] <%Mendin> The Skull Rooms pay double

[4:55:21] <%chiazam> Pat's probably going to reach the surface
[4:55:23] <+jjhoho> except that time he steals
[4:55:35] <@SoFarFetched> Just reminder,no spoilers on stuff Pat hasn't seen yet.
[4:55:37] <$RealThiele> im guessing the next boss kills him

[4:55:59] <MisterArcanine> definitely won't one shot the next boss but he can probably learn
[4:56:01] <@SoFarFetched> Since this is pretty much as far as Pat as gotten. So no saying what's coming up.

[5:05:58] <oOZtkOo> hes pretty tough
[5:05:58] <Grandma_Amari> I wouldn't be surprised if there was more after Hades honestly
[5:05:59] <Manwad> yes very true
[5:05:59] <lucas18293> there's well over 100 hours of game
[5:06:00] <AhmCha> oh yeah
[5:06:03] <LoneFonte> LIKE A SHITTON
[5:06:05] <%Chimeraelite> Imagine Binding of Issac
[5:06:05] <+mechslayer71> Yep
[5:06:09] <$RealThiele> skelly best s-link
[5:06:10] <%CrematedCube> I believe there is more now, but I stopped after beating him
[5:06:11] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> beating the game is just the begining.
[5:06:12] <AhmCha> Beating Hades is like....step 1 of 50
[5:06:13] <penitentpentwitch> There is, you unlock the 'last act' which only progresses every time you win. It takes several victories to earn the true ending.
[5:06:15] <%za7az> @PatStaresAt Do you plan to have more Hades streams until you beat it? (Full playthrough?)
[5:06:15] <%Totally_Not_Toby> like weapons you haven't seen yet and weapon types that change the way you use them
[5:06:15] <+wolfofsound> @PatStaresAt I've played for over a year and after this last patch I have hours still left LUL
[5:06:17] <+Cryptotheus> 17,000 LINES OF DIALOGUE

[5:06:49] <%BubbaRands> Now THAT was a line read! PogChamp
[5:06:51] <+TheCoobie> missed talking to dusa

[5:06:54] <%Fooguwu> ass pecs
[5:06:54] <%Chimeraelite> holy fuck that's a lot of pairings
[5:06:55] <%Daniel_Is_I> With blood
[5:06:55] <+wolfofsound> @PatStaresAt when you beat daddy
[5:06:56] <%CrematedCube> Check the weapon twice
[5:06:57] <+pectusumbra> click the empty space
[5:06:58] <tolloponik> Killing Hades
[5:07:00] <lucas18293> there's 50+ difficulty levels
[5:07:00] <MisterArcanine> you gotta beat him
[5:07:00] <ergulor> After you beat hades
[5:07:00] <+jjhoho> gotta beat a hades I think Pat
[5:07:01] <%FacetiousAF> titan blood does aspects
[5:07:03] <Godzillaahh> you have to have all weapons
[5:07:03] <%linSP> beat dad
[5:07:03] <penitentpentwitch> I believe you have to unlock all weapons/beat hades once
[5:07:04] <oOZtkOo> beat hades
[5:07:04] <$RealThiele> BLUD
[5:07:05] <VritraReiRei> do more runs and more things unlock @PatStaresAt
[5:07:06] <AoiRob> beat the game
[5:07:09] <%Laecerelius> You haven't even unlocked all the weapons yet
[5:07:10] <+wolfofsound> so uh good luck
[5:07:10] <tranquilturnip> Foit more
[5:07:11] <%DedlokPM> When you get a Titan's Blood
[5:07:11] <MisterArcanine> the game isn't over after you beat him
[5:07:13] <Mr_Rakjo> YOu need BLUUD
[5:07:15] <+pectusumbra> no way, I know it's not that
[5:07:15] <%bevyrage> you can unlock aspects before beating hades
[5:07:16] <%Totally_Not_Toby> check the weapon again
[5:07:18] <%TheWinged7> the god not the game
[5:07:18] <%kknutson4> check the empty space where the sword was
[5:07:19] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> no, you can unlock them before that
[5:07:21] <%tanarath> Talk to Dusa
[5:07:21] <%CrematedCube> I don't... think that's right
[5:07:21] <%iamnolionheart> When you unlock all the weapons
[5:07:22] <+pectusumbra> I think you have to unlock all weapons
[5:07:22] <%Broand> DO you? I got aspects earlier than that
[5:07:24] <%linSP> beat dad for as pects
[5:07:24] <LoneFonte> all weapons
[5:07:27] <%PR0swagonist> beat hades with your shit defualt weapons
[5:07:29] <$RealThiele> you can get blud without beating hades but its harder
[5:07:30] <Godzillaahh> beat hades or unlock all weapons
[5:07:30] <%Mendin> Get the Woolie Fists
[5:07:31] <%bevyrage> equip a weapon then hit RB again while near it
[5:07:31] <+pectusumbra> check the shadows of the weapons and see
[5:07:31] <%Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt Grab a weapon then check it again?
[5:07:32] <%Totally_Not_Toby> after you pick it up check the weapon again
[5:07:33] <+jjhoho> there's honestly more than twice the post game content there is game
[5:07:34] <%Fadedblank247> i think its after u unlock all the weapons
[5:07:34] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt You also may need to unlock all weapons
[5:07:36] <%Totally_Not_Toby> if you can
[5:07:36] <+Grizwaldus> dont spend it then
[5:07:37] <Corvan> no, you dont need to beat hades to use the blood
[5:07:37] <lucas18293> @patstaresat check the same weapon twice, pat
[5:07:38] <sanslogic> go buy 1 more key to get the FISTS
[5:07:40] <%FroggoPrince> Bow w/ the explosive upgrade is by far my fave
[5:07:43] <%za7az> Things get uh... weird once you beat him
[5:07:45] <AoiRob> you also need Gun
[5:07:45] <+pectusumbra> I think it's you have to unlock them all first
[5:07:47] <penitentpentwitch> Not unlocked yet~
[5:07:48] <%Daniel_Is_I> Can't do it then
[5:07:48] <%iamnolionheart> Unlock all the weapons
[5:07:48] <%Totally_Not_Toby> okay, so that doesn't trigger now i guess
[5:07:49] <%FacetiousAF> 🤔 i know i got aspects before beating hades at least
[5:07:49] <%Fooguwu> masochist skeleton
[5:07:50] <+mechslayer71> Do a run with all weapons @patstaresat
[5:07:52] <lucas18293> ah dang it's not there then
[5:07:52] <MisterArcanine> its not unlocked yet
[5:07:53] <%Nekros4442> Think you have to unlock all the weapons first
[5:07:56] <Reaganball_Z> Shield is definitely easiest to beat the game with unless they nerfed it for 1.0. Block blocks EVERYTHING.
[5:07:56] <VritraReiRei> he hasnt unlocked it yet guys
[5:07:58] <%Tearonex> He hasn't unlocked aspects yet
[5:07:58] <KaiserMario> Gotta search for "hmm... mother..."
[5:07:58] <ergulor> Yeah you also need all your weapons
[5:07:59] <%FacetiousAF> gun sucks
[5:08:00] <tolloponik> oh My bad
[5:08:03] <$Teh_Un> 🔫
[5:08:03] <penitentpentwitch> Gg
[5:08:03] <%TamsynRRD> @patstaresat You’ve got enough gems to get a key and unlock the fists
[5:08:05] <$RealThiele> he hast done all the base weapons
[5:08:06] <%charp35> oh you might have to unlock them all first
[5:08:07] <RushUnplugged> just gotta get multiple runs in, it's gonna happen
[5:08:09] <+mechslayer71> Do a run with all weapons to unlock upgrades
[5:08:10] <%FacetiousAF> GOOD GAME
[5:08:11] <+pectusumbra> Alright, I stayed up super late, I gotta get to bed, good night!
[5:08:13] <%BinaryFireball> thrilled
[5:08:14] <%CrematedCube> Yeah that's the trigger, unlock all weapons
[5:08:18] <SchroedingersFerret> gun gang is coming

[5:08:34] <$KnivesEve> so should i buy this game?
[5:08:43] <@SoFarFetched> if the game looked fun for you,buy it
[5:08:43] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Cool, I'm gonna play Hades myself now :) Have a good night, chat
[5:08:44] <+wolfofsound> @KnivesEve yes
[5:08:46] <VritraReiRei> @Reaganball_Z even without the block its just very good not counting the other aspects. it just attacks so fast
[5:08:46] <%Monkeyweed21> Is this as good as the 12/10 masterpiece that is Transistor?
[5:08:47] <%za7az> @FacetiousAF the gun shines with the triple special
[5:08:47] <%Mendin> yes
[5:08:47] <+mechslayer71> @kniveseve Yes
[5:08:48] <%linSP> star renegade reminds me of enter the breach
