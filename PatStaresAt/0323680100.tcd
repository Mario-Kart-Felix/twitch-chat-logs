[1:08:34] <+Cervarian> The new Training mode they added is great for learning the mechanics - like other fighting game tutorials @AngriestPat
[1:08:34] <MasterDecoder> Twitch is also being fucky, buffers and says I'm offline
[1:08:36] <AlasterAngelo> you're a Resident Evil stan Pat
[1:08:36] <+TsunamiPoro> stando powah

[1:09:08] <lemon_lore> oh youtube back online
[1:09:09] <+mechslayer71> Nicki Minaj Stan‚Äôs are the worst
[1:09:12] <+bobfriskit> left+X +heavy, Back Square
[1:09:13] <al0nem0nster> never really liked the idea of spinning attacks in "realistic" combat games, always feels like you should get stabbed in the back.
[1:09:18] <beatie_g> ah okay, cool
[1:09:18] <therealbl33pbl00p> eat his ass
[1:09:23] <+Kaprosaha> Pat you gotta cancel your dodge attack into a dodge into a dodge attack into a kick which you cancel into a dodge
[1:09:25] <+SparkAfterDark> Palm strike against plate armor... What?
[1:09:27] <Chipshandon12> do these guys got any chi powers
[1:09:30] <beatie_g> I hope my boy Raider got buffs
[1:09:30] <+Thelovelybison> this game isnt realistic, just inspired
[1:09:32] <NoirePanzer> PogChamp
[1:09:32] <+RichardRasmus> how much will ubisoft get off of the chinese from this alone
[1:09:32] <%PipIV> how old/new is Stan's?
[1:09:33] <element_of_loyalty> PMS
[1:09:34] <%Ninestempest> @SparkAfterDark he's hitting VERY HARD
[1:09:35] <+mimikyu92> the kick is only really good for ledging and creating some breathing room tho
[1:09:35] <$GohanEgret> @AmericanaRed i get that reference
[1:09:37] <+theKingRamses> the monk has chi powers
[1:09:39] <+dodge_and_dust> oh wow he actually started
[1:09:39] <+Thelovelybison> literal anime magic in executions now

[1:09:49] <element_of_loyalty> BABE

[1:09:54] <beatie_g> oh shit PogChamp
[1:09:55] <%pennykettle_> I dislike the new hero selection, its all so small
[1:09:55] <Josef_Stryker> @AngriestPat U can cancel ur dodge heavy with another dodge heavy and u can just keep cancelling as long as u got stamina
[1:09:57] <mrsandmando> Where's her dumb mask??
[1:09:57] <Xelhesia> NUXIA IS AWESOME

[1:10:06] <talisign> Shujinko
[1:10:08] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @AngriestPat the after battle shit can still take forever to finish, but yeah menu is awesome now
[1:10:08] <+SparkAfterDark> @Ninestempest So his hand should be VERY broken
[1:10:09] <%Rngiddion> Valk and Warden
[1:10:10] <Commander_Spyke> raider did
[1:10:11] <beatie_g> Raider apparently
[1:10:12] <dekkitout> deeznutz?
[1:10:16] <chza> For Honor was always meant to be a fighting game, no?
[1:10:18] <+Thelovelybison> warden and valk had reworks a while back
[1:10:18] <+mimikyu92> Valk and Warden are the most recent
[1:10:18] <gorillahandz> warden buffs woooo
[1:10:27] <element_of_loyalty> HER VOICE IS SO CUTE
[1:10:29] <Arek_1> How is Warlord?
[1:10:31] <mrsandmando> These new characters have good designs.
[1:10:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> rock paper scissors
[1:10:32] <sosuke5> Why does Woolie think every "summonable entity that stays close to you" constitutes a STAND?
[1:10:33] <%crimsonharvest> its basically PunchOut
[1:10:35] <+Thelovelybison> warlord is good
[1:10:43] <+Thelovelybison> not as busted as he was
[1:10:43] <+ABadIdea> @AngriestPat Oh man I love Tiger Hook Swords. I wish they had those in Soul Calibur yandHappy
[1:10:44] <Admiral_PopnFresh> oh, she's like orochi and can't maintain gaurd
[1:10:44] <gorillahandz> because he's a fuckin nerd @sosuke5
[1:10:49] <Lastname_Firstname> Does nuxia's gimmick shit still not do anything if you're not guarding in that direction?
[1:10:53] <+mimikyu92> WELCOME TO NEW MECHANIC
[1:10:59] <%deviljhojho94> hmmmmmmmm
[1:11:00] <element_of_loyalty> tank controls

[1:11:03] <joeshmoethejohndoe> man...
[1:11:04] <SilverInferno3> @sosuke5 To be fair, he's hardly the only one
[1:11:04] <Arek_1> Can Warlord still grab and drag you anywhere?
[1:11:05] <Estuko> @sosuke5 because the concept stands out to him the most as a STAND and thats prob what he's most hype about anything being lol
[1:11:09] <%ECRead> backward facing blades are so fuckin stupid but i kind like em
[1:11:10] <%Meme_Platinum> why is she backwards wielding this had been proven throughout history to be a terrible fighting style
[1:11:11] <Josef_Stryker> Warlord is good but he could do with a slight buff here and there
[1:11:20] <+Kaprosaha> She big weird. You can only do a successful trap on the side they're blocking. If trap fails can follow with a light to prevent gb
[1:11:22] <%DedlokPM> @ABadIdea same reason that some people think all tissues are a kleenex or all adhesive badages are a band-aid.
[1:11:22] <element_of_loyalty> Peach has no glasses
[1:11:27] <HeadsHeldHigh> Which Wu Lins are gender locked. Can I play a rule 63 guan yu

[1:11:43] <+SparkAfterDark> Bald power
[1:11:47] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat he's actually the coolest
[1:11:48] <deviljhojho94> for honor lore states that the cooler your fighting style is, the bigger the favor the gods bestow upon you. Read your crikLore you fucking lorelet
[1:11:48] <element_of_loyalty> QUIT

[2:17:06] <OwlLightningMage> I love having dreams about failing. I have those all the time
[2:17:14] <+SparkAfterDark> Next faction should seriously just be something full on magic though. Or maybe after one more real life culture, because I feel like at this point "hey this regular guy has a mildly different kind of pointy stick" is going to get dead boring. Give fantasy bullshit after that.

[2:20:53] <+SuichiTanaka> Shotgun in the face is best quest.
[2:20:56] <MasterDecoder> @Ell1ot You have to have another dog ready to make, then drain the zit into the genetics
[2:21:01] <+Mekhet09> Isn't there a practice mode?
[2:21:04] <Xenioplate> The meme quest, every BL2 quest
[2:21:10] <+CallMeB> the jump off the cliff one is fun
[2:21:10] <+SparkAfterDark> Either that or they just go full on generic "light medium heavy, sword dual wield spear" and crank out dozens of factions with only vague differences. They're already approaching sameyness with only 4 factions.
[2:21:18] <archxeno> pat WILL die of gout
[2:21:24] <%vaporousTippler> I switched from soda to water and gout went away.

[2:32:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Paige is one of those toads with the holes in their backs for the babies to live in
[2:32:50] <+GuelermeDias> makes sense
[2:32:53] <+Blargimazombie> @SuichiTanaka I like the way you think

[2:33:28] <peachsaliva_isa_man> @angriestpat how does it feel to be a royal subject of her majesty the queen?
[2:33:29] <+rabidclone> dspat
[2:33:32] <+ApparentReality> DSPat strikes again NotLikeThis
[2:33:33] <Your_Friendly_Futa> PAT DOES IT FOR FREE
[2:33:33] <+SparkAfterDark> This man has a perfectly good stick why does he block with his hands?
[2:33:39] <%ThatGuyfromMars> !raffle
[2:33:39] <@Moobot> Added one or more users to the raffle
[2:33:43] <+mistersokar> Pat would first need hair to dye
[2:33:45] <+GuelermeDias> the stick is for hitting
[2:33:49] <+theKingRamses> i think the monk's side triple light attack is supposed to be a good move out of the things you're doing
[2:33:50] <+rabidclone> the raffle is real
[2:33:51] <$Niney_Who> "Shaymin"
[2:33:52] <$Niney_Who> stop it
[2:33:52] <jeecay> where's lord elmo?
[2:34:02] <zal_silverfang> wait what happened?
[2:34:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> His name is Emlo
[2:34:07] <A_Zealous_Retort> you lose mana per second for existing
[2:34:08] <zamzoph> What's the OP self-inserts?
[2:34:09] <Glacierstorm> they borked mana regen for shamans so their mana just constantly drains for no reason
[2:34:11] <Glacierstorm> its goofy
[2:34:11] <+JenovasPuppet> What if Maireeo were a shaymin?
[2:34:11] <Chipshandon12> they nerfed mana regen in pvp at max level but just did -4000 mp at all levels instead of a %
[2:34:11] <%Divryne> EMLO.
[2:34:12] <+Aleate> Isnt Shayamin a pokemon? LUL
[2:34:13] <%wreckramsez> Wow you got my name right
[2:34:13] <Xelhesia> NEGATIVE MANA SOUNDS NONSENSICAL
[2:34:14] <KaiserMario> Its mana but negative
[2:34:14] <+SparkAfterDark> Mayrio
[2:34:16] <Xenioplate> He slep
[2:34:16] <wsintai> Shaymin is a pretty neat Pokemon. What about the Shamans though? @AngriestPat
[2:34:17] <MasterDecoder> "Shah-min"
[2:34:18] <+Diet_z_dan> Shaman In wow OMEGALUL
[2:34:19] <peachsaliva_isa_man> @angriestpat also it's physically impossible for Paige to have ovaries
[2:34:21] <%Ferakin> I think it's in PvP? Most of the ranting is about the horrific writing of Nathanos
[2:34:22] <MelaninMonsta> @SparkAfterDark listen we dont do logic in for honor LUL
[2:34:24] <yendoria> @AngriestPat under certain scenarios in dungeons and battlegrounds shaman will literally lose mana by existing
[2:34:24] <jeecay> and in that sleep even death will die
[2:34:28] <%koolaid_kevster> Ily pat!!
[2:34:30] <$Niney_Who> Don't worry guys it'll be on the backburner. Like Female Worgens
[2:34:36] <Xelhesia> THATS TRASH'
[2:34:39] <$Niney_Who> Because those will totally be fixed soon haHAA
[2:34:41] <talisign> @peachsaliva_isa_man Wow. Already in there.
[2:34:42] <isntit> so the joke is that enhancement sucks so bad that they now just lose mana for existing
[2:34:47] <juxtest> Typical for Shaman
[2:34:48] <jeecay> Elmo is an elder god. PRAISE HIM YOU PEONS!!!
[2:34:48] <Rhonne> @angriestpat I'm pretty sure Blizzard just personally hates all shaman
[2:34:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Only WoW I need is of the SFM variety
[2:34:52] <Run44forrest> elmo sleeps?
[2:34:54] <%Kazooki_Kazami> no wonder wow's sub numbers are really low right now
[2:34:59] <yendoria> Were shaman EVER good?
[2:35:07] <arkv01> gurrrl i'll show me my negative mana regen
[2:35:07] <eldritchmoeblob> sometimes
[2:35:21] <%Jpdodds> Can we see the Nuxia again?\
[2:35:21] <FstSergeant8595> PogChamp
[2:35:22] <element_of_loyalty> Blame Gout
[2:35:24] <Guntanks_in_Space> maybe yeah you're mashing it out
[2:35:26] <IminyourBase> i have headphones on and i can hear you sucking ghost dicks and i hate it
[2:35:26] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat timing like peacekeeper's guard break stab
[2:35:27] <%Fedgle> don't do it too fast
[2:35:29] <snnore> timing
[2:35:29] <velemi> resto shamans were good sometimes
[2:35:30] <Glacierstorm> shaman were fun in bc when you could use a twohander and oneshot kids with windfury
[2:35:30] <%TaifuDragon> gotta be tap tap tap
[2:35:31] <%skizzuto> i think it's timing
[2:35:33] <%Fedgle> you gotta time it in a rhythm
[2:35:33] <%Aitch971> @Rhonne I'm pretty sure they hate their entire playerbase
[2:35:33] <eldritchmoeblob> from what i can see is this reminds me a lot of brad wong in doa
[2:35:40] <Guntanks_in_Space> oh so the timing is like PK GB stab?
[2:35:44] <Run44forrest> out of stamina sounds like android phone battery notification
[2:35:44] <egggggggggggggggggggggg> it has to come out one after another from the same side. it cant be from top tho
[2:35:45] <%TaifuDragon> yeah
[2:35:47] <Xelhesia> I THINK ITS A HIT CONFIRM OR A RAPID PRESS?
[2:35:48] <%TaifuDragon> you can't mash it out
[2:35:48] <%Fedgle> yea
[2:35:51] <+SparkAfterDark> Shamans are good when they are cute draenei girls with lil hooves and cute goat horns
[2:36:01] <%TaifuDragon> but it's all confirmed so it's pretty stronk besides
[2:36:03] <arkv01> i'm fairly certain in a real life scenario shaolin boy cannot afford to take any hits from medieval knight swings
[2:36:08] <Chipshandon12> draenei girls have huge dongs
[2:36:09] <$Niney_Who> Remember when female worgens looked good
[2:36:11] <snnore> you need to watch your stamina
[2:36:13] <Guntanks_in_Space> Shamans in this game though, they're highly deadly murder machines
[2:36:17] <+SparkAfterDark> That too
[2:36:23] <yendoria> @Niney_Who they never did
[2:36:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I can't unhear the ghost blowjobs smacks now. Paige's were worse though @IminyourBase
[2:36:32] <%TaifuDragon> Draenei girls are the men in the relationship
[2:36:32] <AlasterAngelo> in a real life scenario this fight would never be happening
[2:36:46] <FstSergeant8595> @TaifuDragon Blood elve females > draenei females
[2:36:51] <%TaifuDragon> Wow get out
[2:36:52] <IminyourBase> @Sphincter_Spelunker i'm sorry to have ruined your evening
[2:36:52] <+dodge_and_dust> oh my god. he didn't realize he had a reflex block?
[2:36:59] <$Niney_Who> @yendoria They used to be better than they are now after they outsourced the "new" model to some chinese team that just... fucking ruined it. And it looks out of place compared to every other model. And armor doesn't even look right half the time.
[2:37:07] <%DedlokPM> WOO WOO WOO
[2:37:07] <%TaifuDragon> and take your druggy waifu with you
[2:37:08] <eldritchmoeblob> nice

[2:37:21] <Run44forrest> havent played this game in so long i miss getting 4v1d shaman shoved off cliffs
[2:37:22] <%Remery_> He's a hybrid, with a reflex guard, deflect, qi stance, and crushing counter
[2:37:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @IminyourBase Nah. Like I said, Paige's were worse. This is fine. coxWat
[2:37:32] <%il_barbiero> sometimes i forget how good pat is at videogames

[2:38:09] <VeryTricky> Has this warden shoulder bashed once
[2:38:11] <%Mikatonic> ps4 turned off?
[2:38:11] <$Niney_Who> @yendoria b a c k b u r n e r cryUh
[2:38:12] <+BopBeep> Wow he must be cheating right Pat
