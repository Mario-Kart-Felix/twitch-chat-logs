[0:11:04] <notsoy> Pat Luthor
[0:11:08] <%Brunty1234> fuck Kingdom hearts
[0:11:08] <%YakumoYomi> Luthor legitimately thinks Superman is a threat and hates him. Pat just hates Superman.

[0:29:06] <dabuurd> Superman totally says the nword
[0:29:07] <%Frost_Quill> Get a super strong villain to mug Clark Kent in front of a bunch of witnesses, he can't defend himself without revealing his identity.
[0:29:18] <%ahomeschooldropout> lmao

[0:29:43] <@Spydurman> Superman - "My mom made this suit" Pat - "Superman uses his mom as slave labor"
[0:29:43] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Pat, you'd deffo be all "casual reminder, Superman, that this isn't a good look."
[0:29:47] <%JumboCrunchies> Superman was born in Rural Kentucky. There is a solid chance he is at least a little homophobic.
[0:29:58] <%megadblitz> pat is like one of those EARLY early superman one-off villians with one gimmick
[0:29:59] <godzookylives> @PatStaresAt the old explanation for why no one recognizes Superman as Clark Kent is that he vibrates his face anytime a camera is near
[0:30:01] <$hewlettfan96> Cheer500 would you destroy Superman’s house on Minecraft and call it shit? Also go to the store and steal all his favourite snacks not cause you like them just to spite him??

[0:30:23] <+JustToWatch> do we actually KNOW that superman can read?
[0:30:24] <knight_verse> let's be honest... Poetry does suck and most of the people who do it are bad at it.
[0:30:28] <+Qooley> @PatStaresAt hey pat hows the stream going
[0:30:36] <dabuurd> i can't get over the mental image of superman doing his best blaccent and calling everyone his n----a
[0:30:37] <%moonmintparadise> If Superman is so strong and fast, why can't he build himself a better reputation???
[0:30:39] <scrumbotime> pat is REJUVINATED by hating superman
[0:30:42] <%IDTheftVictim> Why are we comparing Pat to Lex Luthor when this is clearly J Jonah Jameson behavior
[0:30:45] <%Frost_Quill> Man giggles to himself over his anti-Superman fantasies.
[0:30:50] <%strakillias> Would you donate $5 to Superman's stream so he has to read a recommendation for Lex Luthor's better stream?

[0:31:46] <%CzeekyTV> i love KH and that diaper shit is hilarious
[0:31:46] <ErikFeral> You Don't Want to Know.
[0:31:47] <%Agami23> ventus is not roxas in birth by sleep
[0:31:48] <%GIGA255> Roxas needs two keyblades. one for each house of his divorced parents. it's aaaaall an allegory
[0:31:49] <%Kyma1020> the guy that Roxas is based off of
[0:31:50] <sydowoodo> don't forget vanitas
[0:31:50] <%megadblitz> this feels like important lore, someone should put this in the wiki

[0:32:08] <insertedgynamehere___> the not Roxas? Noxas
[0:32:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> Basically yeah
[0:32:09] <%Frost_Quill> They never explained why Vanitas looked like Sora.
[0:32:11] <%Garthunox> Thats right Jay
[0:32:12] <%Monkeyweed21> everyone forgot vanitas
[0:32:13] <%cvp5127> light
[0:32:13] <draca23> Ventus is not Roxas, but Roxas is based off Ventus because Nomura likes to piss me off
[0:32:15] <wolfen091> can we go back to superman and coconuts, i really don't care about KH
[0:32:17] <dabuurd> Sonic would froth roxas' diaper for sure. brb working on an unrelated fanfic..
[0:32:17] <ErikFeral> Bully Woolie into making a KH Lore video
[0:32:18] <%Agami23> the explanation for why vanitas looks like sora is so dumb
[0:32:19] <matsu_me> vanituhs
[0:32:20] <+BigNerdSam> Ventus is the kid that the newborn Sora fused hearts with, which is why Roxas looks like Ventus and Vanitas looks like Sora
[0:32:23] <%NitronStreams> its vuh neetus
[0:32:24] <gespenst_mr_ghost> Sounds about right
[0:32:27] <sydowoodo> it's edgy sora
[0:32:28] <%MidnightBurst12> yes
[0:32:32] <+blaze__drag> but kingdom hearts lore is so simple and straightforwards!
[0:32:33] <knight_verse> Google Vanitas real face.
[0:32:34] <%MugenSandan> Pat I highly recommend the JustaPancake Kingdom hearts summary
[0:32:35] <%ahomeschooldropout> Kingdom Heart's Lore reminds me of Paige's Undertale Fanfiction she wrote
[0:32:38] <%Kyma1020> Vanitas looks like Sora because Roxas went in Sora's heart when he was born
[0:32:41] <%THATGUY_789> anime edgelord #

[0:36:12] <ErikFeral> Superman: I feel like I live in a world made of cardboard.
[0:36:12] <+BigCoffee> lex could be an amazing human if he wasn't a petty dumbass
[0:36:19] <Parapattern> He fights Shazam over it. It's great
[0:36:21] <%Kyma1020> The Kent's having to wrap Christmas presents in lead foil so supes couldn't see

[0:36:31] <%Kyma1020> "You mean Santa did that"
[0:36:31] <%SaiyanShoto> Sometimes I can't watch Justice League because of how they write Wonder Woman in that, she's done dirty in that show

[0:38:03] <%Frost_Quill> @PatStaresAt One time Lex went back in time and got Superman's parents to divorce so he could get with his mom and he'd become his step-dad.  I am not kidding.

[0:40:00] <%Frost_Quill> Roxas can only dual-wield buttholes because Xion gave him hers.
[0:40:00] <knight_verse> DMC V is just a Kingdom Hearts game in disguise.
[0:40:03] <PanicSwytch> Go for it
[0:40:04] <%RealThiele> its pretty dumb even if you do know
[0:40:06] <@Spydurman> Superman hate coming down? Rev up on KH hate

[0:40:21] <@Ranryu692> none of it?
[0:40:22] <+Your_heals> the end
[0:40:24] <%RetroCop87> When Goofy got fucking killed
[0:40:25] <%cvp5127> @PatStaresAt do you know about girl sora?
[0:40:27] <%Pookiedaexzile> Lion King 2
[0:40:31] <%Agami23> when xemnas threw that building at you and you zantetsukened it?
[0:40:33] <%CzeekyTV> the combat of kh2
[0:40:33] <%blankwaffle> when sora blew cloud?
[0:40:33] <Kefkaisnotamused> Throwing it away?
[0:40:34] <%THATGUY_789> Kingdom Sharts
[0:40:36] <Masamune84> You don't have to play it?
[0:40:38] <%Puhff> goofy getting hit on the head with a rock
[0:40:40] <marvel877> When Goofy got killed?
[0:40:41] <%Bailey__gaming> getting a refund on it
[0:40:42] <boof_abroad> Guess that's the end of my summer vacat
[0:40:45] <PanicSwytch> The opening song?
[0:40:46] <sydowoodo> hell yeah she is
[0:40:48] <Blank9> when sora went into the closet with the big S on his chest as riku and yensid kissed
[0:40:51] <$hewlettfan96> Kingdom shafts
[0:40:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> u mean the hot one
[0:40:54] <%Treuan> Hardest route
[0:40:54] <%RealThiele> until she is dumb
[0:40:54] <%Ne1son> Aqua sucks
[0:40:55] <+TEHMIKEMCCANN> TEHMIKEMCCANN subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:41:01] <%logoth_> lol
[0:41:03] <cvp5127> himbo and child
[0:41:05] <%RetroCop87> My favorite part was when Donald fucking showed up Realm Reborn Bahamut with a Zettaflare
[0:41:09] <knight_verse> Pat, we already know you didn't play it.
[0:41:10] <%Kyma1020> yeah that was weird
[0:41:21] <%LordSDB> I did Aqua last funny enough
[0:41:22] <mr_saturday93> The order is Terra, Ven, Aqua in how it should be played
[0:41:23] <dabuurd> Gorsh Sora I didn't know i could swell so large with your waste! A Hyuk!
[0:41:23] <%jinking79> Aqua was easy mode
[0:41:26] <%CzeekyTV> Yeah every game made by the B team sucks (BBS, KH3)
[0:41:27] <%SaiyanShoto> That's the game though, they have different storylines that converge
[0:41:28] <JoeBecomesJoe> You're not wrong
[0:41:30] <%Kyma1020> on paper you are supposed to swap between the three
[0:41:31] <%THATGUY_789> I liked their song Barbie Girl
[0:41:32] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt It's because Aqua had the least buildup. Ventus looks like Roxas and Terra was a superboss, so they assumed you would go off that.
[0:41:39] <draca23> Aqua is really bad in BBS, in terms of story and character. If you actually pay attention, she comes across as inconsistent at best.
[0:41:40] <+bugz_munny> Remember when Aqua got stuck in KH hell forever
[0:41:40] <%RetroCop87> the unbirthed
[0:41:43] <%Pookiedaexzile> Jay?
[0:41:44] <%Treuan> They are literally just blue heartless
[0:41:46] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt are KH games even fun games?
[0:41:51] <%Monkeyweed21> so did everyone else
[0:41:51] <mr_saturday93> You forget a lot of things
[0:41:52] <+CharmSovereign> dream eaters
[0:41:53] <PanicSwytch> Yeah the unversed were dumb
[0:41:55] <+BigCoffee> Birth by sleep controls like fucking ass compared to Kh1 and 2
[0:42:00] <%RealThiele> and then KH became pokemon with DDD
[0:42:01] <%kingofasgard> Leonard Nimoy voiced Xehanort
[0:42:02] <%NopeBadguy> 1, 2, RECoM and 3 are fun @DianaTheAscian
[0:42:03] <%linSP> The unbirthed
[0:42:06] <@ssjklyco> There can only be one Keyblade wielder Sora, except for these times when we had a school
[0:42:09] <%anAngryHamster> The original Japanese name was the Unbirth
[0:42:12] <%Vextalyst> @PatStaresAt Aqua is the only female character in Kingom Hearts NOT to get Naruto'd
[0:42:14] <%spitelite> so did square enix
[0:42:14] <ErikFeral> Birth By Sleep had the same narrative problem as the Star Wars Prequels. Where all the main cast have to be hit with the Stupid Stick for the Original Story to happen.
[0:42:20] <ErikFeral> Yes.
[0:42:21] <%RealThiele> LUL
[0:42:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> AQUA GOT NORTED
[0:42:24] <%Kyma1020> Still owns
[0:42:25] <%NopeBadguy> Kingdom Hearts 2 is second only to DMC3 on the PS2
[0:42:26] <%Frost_Quill> Oh Paige played FFXIV???  I gotta watch that.
[0:42:27] <Profmcstevie> KH2 Final Mix is an outstanding action RPG
[0:42:27] <%DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL
[0:42:30] <Dova573> I dont believe you
[0:42:33] <%Agami23> kingdom hearts 3 is shit and plays badly unless you play the hardest difficulty
[0:42:35] <%CzeekyTV> KH2 is like one of the best action adventure games
[0:42:37] <%JoshManVGH> Games are great, cutscenes are nonsense
[0:42:37] <%CatRidder> THATS A LIE A YOU KNOW IT
[0:42:37] <+bugz_munny> Crit mode KH2 is like one of the best action games ever
[0:42:38] <JoeBecomesJoe> Remember when Micky Mouse decided not to help aqua out of the dark zone for years?
[0:42:40] <%Monkeyweed21> KH3 is amazing with Remind
[0:42:43] <Blank9> norted
[0:42:45] <Flame_Water> it was fun when i was 14
[0:42:46] <%Monkeyweed21> gameplay wise at least
[0:42:46] <%Garthunox> yup
[0:42:48] <%RealThiele> Gummi ships is garbage
[0:42:48] <%SaiyanShoto> They all are, the only one I would say aren't fun are Chain of Memories and Coded that you played on a cell phone
[0:42:52] <%Frost_Quill> KHII FM is honestly one of the best games ever made in my opinion.
[0:42:52] <%Garthunox> you mean platforms?
[0:42:53] <ErikFeral> Yes.
[0:42:53] <%barrakuta371> yeah
[0:42:55] <$hewlettfan96> It’s amazing why
[0:42:58] <%MidnightBurst12> facts
[0:43:03] <%MugenSandan> This is an ice cold take
[0:43:07] <Man_in_the_Red> it was fun before the combat boiled down to QTEs and canned animations
[0:43:09] <mr_saturday93> easier to catch up than nier/drakenguard
[0:43:09] <%DoubleRrico> the answer is watch videos i guess
[0:43:10] <knight_verse> @ssjklyco You do know that KH1 literally hints at there being more Keyblade wielders, right?
[0:43:18] <Profmcstevie> They straight up admitted to nerfing Sora after 2 cos he was so fucking BALLER they had nowhere to challenge him
[0:43:35] <$hewlettfan96> Which kingdom hearts games do i need to play for it to make sense??
[0:43:35] <ErikFeral> You get 1.5+2.5... on PS3.
[0:43:36] <%NopeBadguy> AND THEY WERE
[0:43:40] <%Frost_Quill> Kingdom Hearts 2 is the third game in the series.
[0:43:41] <Flame_Water> agreed
[0:43:41] <%Treuan> Including 3
[0:43:43] <%Pookiedaexzile> Correct
[0:43:44] <%CzeekyTV> THEY ALL PLAY LIKE ASS AFTER 2 it's so disappointing
[0:43:46] <%maskofmichael> Just Wiki-Dive the story
[0:43:49] <ErikFeral> yeeeh.
[0:43:50] <SkinnyRite> Oh, hey, I see Pat is still talking about Kingdom Hearts
[0:43:53] <+BigCoffee> The series peaked at 2
[0:43:53] <%DianaTheAscian> interesting
[0:43:54] <knight_verse> Sora is literally the most overpowered Square Enic character bar none.
[0:43:55] <Blank9> chain of memories, birth by sleep, 358/2 days, just not good
[0:43:56] <+BigCoffee> and then 2 final mix
[0:43:59] <HotMafia81> Timeless classics
[0:44:02] <+bugz_munny> 3 RE:Mind brings it back imo
[0:44:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> i don't need friends, im part of the darkness
[0:44:05] <%kingofasgard> BBS was the best
[0:44:07] <%Pukenasty> chain of memories is doodoo
[0:44:08] <Aeroallways> I don't think the KH2 dev team even worked on any of those
[0:44:09] <%Pookiedaexzile> Star Wars problem: Great Series, Most of its Trash
[0:44:11] <+bugz_munny> the data fights there are great
[0:44:11] <%SaiyanShoto> Nah I had fun with all of them
[0:44:12] <$hewlettfan96> What hell no there are so many great ones what u on about
[0:44:16] <+BigCoffee> BBS plays like SHIT
[0:44:16] <%Frost_Quill> And you gotta learn about the phone games to learn the SUPER IMPORTANT backstory of like everything.
[0:44:16] <marvel877> No one hates Kingdom Hearts more than Kingdom Hearts fans.
[0:44:17] <%Monkeyweed21> it took like a year for them to make KH3 combat up to par
[0:44:20] <WTFOliver> you have any interest in FIST forged in shadow torch?
[0:44:21] <SkinnyRite> Now all someone needs to do is mention Clark Kent and watch him really go off
[0:44:22] <%Agami23> so does 3
[0:44:25] <%Fooguwu> I recently finished Eva 3.33. No spoils but is it supposed to seem like fanfiction?
[0:44:26] <%linSP> Don’t RE:mind me about the other games
[0:44:28] <%MoguManda> MoguManda subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 10 month streak! if months were years my sub could be drafted into the military
[0:44:28] <%SaiyanShoto> Except the cell phone game
[0:44:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> KH is such wholesome cringe
[0:44:34] <%Arek_1> How did KH survive after 2?
[0:44:36] <Kefkaisnotamused> KH is not cool. It's never been cool. It's never going to BE cool.
[0:44:40] <%CzeekyTV> Wait does Re:Mind go back and fix the base KH3 combat?
[0:44:45] <%Frost_Quill> That Eva ending was WILD.
[0:44:51] <+bugz_munny> MGP
[0:44:54] <+BigCoffee> you need 250k MGP
[0:44:56] <+BigCoffee> for it
[0:44:57] <%Garthunox> You buy it with MGP
[0:44:57] <%Pookiedaexzile> It's Fuck you fiction
[0:44:59] <%Treuan> Stock up on Gold Saucer MGP
[0:45:00] <%SaiyanShoto> @Kefkaisnotamused To you.

[0:45:02] <%afronooch> wait did i farm mgp for no reason?
[0:45:06] <%Garthunox> you need 250k mgp
[0:45:07] <%JoshManVGH> 200k MGP
[0:45:10] <%Pookiedaexzile> It's "Stop asking me for shit" fiction
[0:45:11] <Profmcstevie> Remind fixes KH3 a LITTLE bit, definitely a more tolerable game afterwards
[0:45:11] <knight_verse> Eww Evangelion.
[0:45:15] <%Monkeyweed21> @CzeekyTV yea it came with a free patch that fixed the floaty combos and animation lock and other stuff like that

[0:46:00] <%Sotetsu> Show feet before you shoot them off.
[0:46:01] <%Bailey__gaming> what if they have mecha in that war?
[0:46:01] <%Frost_Quill> @BigYanno Women might be part of the draft by then.

[0:46:10] <$hewlettfan96> Too gay for war
[0:46:12] <AMajorTom> Soon the draft will be the last starfighter, and they’ll draft you based on vidya skills
[0:46:12] <%Gogogolem> Pat you don't have to shoot your foot.

[0:47:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'm always glad to hear about ppl being happy
[0:47:57] <%CzeekyTV> @Monkeyweed21 The pacing combined with the "enemies are health sponges unless you use the same reaction command every time" makes it such a slog. But if Re:mind is worth it...

[0:52:53] <%THATGUY_789> it's part of the charm
[0:52:55] <%ValHollaYoloson> the voice acting reminds me of RE1
[0:52:57] <dabuurd> Yooooooo this voice acting is PERFECT
[0:53:02] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt FUCK THE ACTOR WHO PLAYED OMAR DIED
[0:53:02] <%Cerabret100> There's one puzzle i think needs changing but other than that, y eah game good

[0:53:04] <%RealThiele> thw lawrd
[0:53:04] <studleydoorite> there's no way this bad voice acting isn't intentional
[0:53:05] <TioXyco> Bad Voice Acting is the ultimate love letter to Resident Evil, honestly
[0:53:06] <SaltyAzteca> Amnesia?! gasped
[0:53:08] <%JoshManVGH> Oh this is the past
[0:53:10] <kikoeru_san> HOLY SHIT, no kidding on the voice acting. why would you change this

[0:56:50] <ergulor> he ded
[0:56:53] <+TheWiggly> good enemy design
[0:56:58] <%Cerabret100> It took me 8+ hours to beat though i smooth brained some puzzles
[0:56:59] <+MisterAvry> @DSD24 I was gonna say the same thing.

[0:57:12] <BlackStarAura> WARIO
[0:57:13] <+tomdwarf> So, whats the consesus on this game, first time hearing about it. Looks like a RE throwback.
[0:57:18] <KeiPrime> its blood
[0:57:20] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Wario emblem?
[0:57:20] <%RealThiele> WAH
[0:57:23] <Parapattern> Wumbo Blood
[0:57:33] <%MoguManda> strawberry popsicle hell yeah
[0:57:43] <%deviljhojho_> how tormented are we talking
[0:57:51] <DSD24> @MisterAvry I got the vibe before last stream but that enemy is super on point
[0:57:54] <rosysyntax> this popsicle sure tastes strange
[0:57:55] <Kefkaisnotamused> This game is basically Resident Hill Within.
[0:58:05] <DSD24> As tormented as your toast landing butter side down
[0:58:07] <%Monkeyweed21> @tomdwarf its like a 7 or an 8 which makes it better than almost every other RE clone
[0:58:08] <%Frost_Quill> She looks like a Fatal Frame protagonist.
[0:58:08] <ExpressNode> Shit I worked 12 hours today  I'm tired
[0:58:12] <@Ranryu692> the wrong cross-shaped emblem
[0:58:21] <rosysyntax> aw man I miss Seabass Constapapadapalos
[0:58:29] <%kingmemelord97> yep
[0:58:31] <DogDadJenkins83> He's not staring hard enough
[0:58:32] <%AJ_Cherenkov> I'm assuming there will be some content in the mansion grounds or the like
[0:58:36] <+MisterAvry> This game is like a mishmash of every horror game since 97
[0:58:37] <Profmcstevie> Streaming always adds on like 2 hours every 10 expected hours lytUMMA
[0:58:37] <%RealThiele> She do have that anime face and ass
[0:58:40] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> I think "Big Charge-O" would have been a better puppy name than Zangief. Just saying.
[0:58:53] <LilacsandFreedom> that little flip they do is hilarious
[0:58:55] <%kingofasgard> it's downstairs and a cop
[0:59:14] <%Frost_Quill> Wait this is a HOSPITAL?

[1:04:41] <%BubbaRands> That’s a puzzle and a half
[1:04:41] <HotMafia81> It's super cool that the examine screen dims the game juuuust enough so that you can't see the sockets

[1:05:55] <+ZoltanBMagnus> shove the VHS in there
[1:06:03] <Kefkaisnotamused> The heck. That looks like a floppy drive.
[1:06:06] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt the computer in the warehouse took floppy's
[1:06:06] <+turtoh> it's for the second floor hallway next to the sewing room

[1:06:51] <stormhawk9891> @Ranryu692 I'm familiar with VHS's and everything after that, I was born in 98 for reference BTW
[1:06:52] <%RealThiele> write only bitches
[1:06:57] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt so you do realize the disk with yoour name on it won't work right?
[1:06:59] <%Faustgesicht> Age

[1:07:14] <Grethe_B> oh, finally I am being awake during one of your streams xD;;, also tormented souls looks so cool!
[1:07:17] <Teyaric> So, MUCH denser/smaller than an RE mansion, but lots more puzzle back and forth
[1:07:18] <%ValHollaYoloson> lol
[1:07:21] <%seththeslime> no pat you are not stupid, this game can be a bit obtuse at times
[1:07:22] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt uh...nothing, go for it champ lol
[1:07:26] <wannabemoogle> Omg the UI is giving me Silent Hill/Resident Evil vibes
[1:07:33] <%JoshManVGH> Your database is a disaster! You're waxing your modem, trying to make it go faster!
[1:07:45] <%RealThiele> yea this feels more like the police station from RE2 with amount of stuff going on
[1:07:55] <%HotSauceFiend> IT cracks me up when I think of movies where a floppy disk in the wrong hands could cause world wide devastation.
[1:08:03] <HaroldDonchee> I want those knights to swing one time. just once
[1:08:09] <%Faustgesicht> @wannabemoogle this game is a silent hill/ RE love letter
[1:08:33] <greenmoose11915> maybe undo the switch
[1:08:37] <%RealThiele> is the disks slider broken ?
[1:08:41] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt i think its a letter removal puzzle
[1:08:43] <@Ranryu692> @stormhawk9891 basically the ZIP disk was a failed competitor to the floppy disk. It was actually better than the floppy, but it came around later and before it could get cheap enough to really catch on CD-R drives and USB storage took over

[1:27:34] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt oh boy I went full dumbass on this puzzle
[1:27:44] <%THATGUY_789> that fact he says commited suicide and not killed yourself makes me laugh so much
[1:27:46] <%Bailey__gaming> Quarter past 10!
[1:28:00] <%ahomeschooldropout> I fucking love neil breen
[1:28:01] <meggogan> How long have you been playing this tonight? I missed the start of it
[1:28:04] <wannabemoogle> I can hear it in his voice
[1:28:10] <studleydoorite> aw fock, I can't believe you've committed suicoide
[1:28:10] <Badgerconda_> Don't forget to smear blood on yourself as you say that
[1:28:12] <+kewlmyc> Good ole Neil Breen
[1:28:19] <Ids560> I do enjoy being exasperated over my friend's fresh corpse
[1:28:20] <Madinki> Neil Breen AKA American Tommy Wiseau
[1:28:24] <%Broand> It's a reference to guilty gear strive, where it's everyones win quote vs nago
[1:28:26] <%kingmemelord97> time puzzle
[1:28:27] <%ValHollaYoloson> I had to look it up

[1:28:31] <dukenux> *Canadian
[1:28:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt THE ANGLE OF THE SWORDS
[1:28:35] <jman13131313> the hand
[1:28:36] <terrible35> Neil Breen is an alien
[1:28:40] <+CaptainDonk> Look at size of da wepon
[1:28:40] <wannabemoogle> And run aruound in the dessert
[1:28:43] <%RealThiele> ooooh clock hands
[1:28:47] <%Dr_Angelic> Is it the position of the hands of the clock? no way
[1:28:51] <PanicSwytch> Shadow puzzlesssss
[1:28:52] <%kingmemelord97> a sort sword and long sword and a spear
[1:28:55] <%Broand> Get it it's an angle
[1:28:56] <%Raikouija> Ohhhh
[1:28:58] <%saadi90> Yup. I think clock hands
[1:29:05] <Profmcstevie> I can be your angle
[1:29:07] <%Dr_Angelic> that's insane even for a RE-style game
[1:29:11] <%Frost_Quill> Or 7.
[1:29:16] <%Broand> they can be yuor angle or youyr debl
[1:29:20] <terrible35> 8
[1:29:20] <dukenux> this is the almost exact same clock puzzle as in REmake
[1:29:27] <dukenux> cmon man
[1:29:28] <%Frost_Quill> Was the one sword pointing the other way though?
[1:29:37] <BeerDestroyer> sh2 clock
[1:29:40] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt pointy ends is where the hands should point
[1:29:45] <+Xenoska> is it 6:15:25?
[1:29:47] <wannabemoogle> A faint circle around the sword would have helped in my opinion
[1:29:48] <rReizs> is the angle based on the handle or the tip
[1:29:48] <GarettLefebvre> 7:15:35
[1:29:50] <+Xenoska> 7*
[1:29:52] <Kefkaisnotamused> This puzzle isn't that insane.
[1:30:01] <%anAngryHamster> Pat, did you forget how clocks work?
[1:30:06] <+CaptainDonk> You gotta set the date too
[1:30:12] <%Bailey__gaming> Big hand little hands and seconds in the painting
[1:30:15] <%Pappajimbo> When big j born
[1:30:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you can do it Pat
[1:30:20] <%Broand> maybe the length of the blade plays a part
[1:30:20] <%Faustgesicht> Length of arms probably matters too
[1:30:20] <%CapnBeefs> Spear is the longest hand
[1:30:22] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt spear is second hand, longsword is minute, gladius is hour
[1:30:25] <%Frost_Quill> Oh the date too.
[1:30:25] <+Xenoska> small sword point, spear point. sword pointing
[1:30:32] <dyllustrate> The seconds hand is the spear

[1:34:29] <GarettLefebvre> long sword
[1:34:32] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt short fat sword is hour, normal sword is minute
[1:34:32] <Mister_McDerp> short is hour, long is minute
[1:34:34] <%strakillias> revrse 3 and 7 hands. Painting one is a long sword. Painting 2 is a short sword

[1:34:54] <Maids4lyfe> hour is small hand
[1:34:55] <%kingmemelord97> no its short pat
[1:34:58] <%Frost_Quill> Hour hand is girthy but it's shorter.

[1:38:24] <ToneBacas> maybe mute ingame music
[1:38:27] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt this is the one puzzle i do think should be changed
[1:38:32] <Profmcstevie> Least it's in the same room
[1:38:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> THESE are my slide puzzles
[1:38:34] <%NitronStreams> oh great music puzzles... this couldnt possibly go wrong

[1:38:41] <%Broand> This is the worst
[1:38:44] <tengel66> psaWink
[1:38:57] <dukenux> is it Fraire Jaques
[1:38:58] <akitanito> music puzzles are my bane
[1:38:59] <%rbakervv> omg, this is a horrible idea for a puzzle
[1:39:05] <%strakillias> Just fucking google the solution on this one. Seems like an effort in frustration
[1:39:05] <%kingmemelord97> oh chat the puzzles keep going
[1:39:13] <notsoy> PLAY FREE BIRD
[1:39:15] <Profmcstevie> Why did it have to be such an awkward input system LUL
[1:39:16] <%rbakervv> i'm tone deaf you fucking asssholes
[1:39:21] <%ValHollaYoloson> it's like 1 2 6 6 2 1?
[1:39:21] <dukenux> why not a piano keyboard
[1:39:22] <%Broand> I'm super bad at tone discernment
[1:39:25] <ChungusQuest> I think note #3 is repeated
[1:39:26] <%Faustgesicht> Song puzzles are the actual worst

[1:39:41] <%Raikouija> Why no piano?!?
[1:39:42] <%Dakuu75> an audio puzzle with 7 unmarked buttons... not the best idea, dev-O's
[1:39:46] <+KingNoodleWalrus> It's 1, 2, 6, 6, 1, 2
[1:39:48] <ToneBacas> mute ingame music for better comprehension
[1:39:52] <%ValHollaYoloson> 126612
[1:39:56] <%DoubleRrico> at least this one plays pleasant notes at you while you're confused
[1:40:02] <%DianaTheAscian> how do we know which one is which?
[1:40:04] <GarettLefebvre> may need to back out before entering the right code
[1:40:15] <tengel66> psaBlep_SG
[1:40:21] <Profmcstevie> That needed many more passes
[1:40:22] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt its literally the only puzzle i couldn't solve on my own
[1:40:28] <%Raikouija> LUL
[1:40:29] <studleydoorite> I think I'm good enough at tones to do this, but not be a musician.  What a useless talent
[1:40:31] <%SirGO0SE> bit cheap
[1:40:32] <IgniSeth> mini music exam LUL
[1:40:33] <+KingNoodleWalrus> It's easier if you have headphones on, but yeah, still annoying

[1:40:57] <rReizs> ah yes there are people who can't music and pitch
[1:41:04] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt I really hope the devs take all this critism and either patch the game to make some of these puzzles better or for their next game.
[1:41:06] <ChungusQuest> was just thinking, I have at least two totally tone-deaf friends
[1:41:10] <%THATGUY_789> adding a playback of the music would be an improvement
[1:41:10] <%Cerabret100> @kingmemelord97 yeah, other than that though, I LOVED having to tank on some and the light bulb popping
[1:41:10] <ChungusQuest> I guess fuck them?
[1:41:24] <%vaporousTippler> Pathfinder has a puzzle with sound, but it's also solved with lore knowledge. I chose sound.
[1:41:25] <%maenos2> itchy tasty

[1:45:04] <Profmcstevie> Didn't need this dude in a poorly lit area, he's more annoying than spooky
[1:45:07] <%athuramn> huge collision, narrow walkway, seems like it
[1:45:11] <%kingmemelord97> @Dakuu75 yes
[1:45:12] <Goatllama> There's got to be at least some difficult bitss
[1:45:13] <%DoubleRrico> it's the spirit of yo mama jokes here to take vengeance on our crude humor!
[1:45:13] <xbb1024> or that fat is extra scary
[1:45:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Pat remembers what it's like to play one of these games blind
[1:45:15] <%Monkeyweed21> you mean like you're supposed yo?
[1:45:26] <%THATGUY_789> I like how the floating ghost mustnt float over the water

[1:46:08] <%kingmemelord97> bedroom next right ?
[1:46:09] <%arcaderabbit48> @PatStaresAt If you hit the enemy hard enough to get past him and knock him out, its not a waste.
[1:46:12] <%Bailey__gaming> load?
[1:46:13] <+TaylOctopus91> Is it a waste if you survived though?
[1:46:20] <Gorgs7> shoulda used ammo to prevent damage huh
[1:46:22] <%Dakuu75> All the armor in this how has Parkinson's
[1:46:23] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt isnt using limited resources  to fix mistakes the whole point of survival horror?
[1:46:25] <%tamale_senpai> @gluttonousmimic almost 2 hours in my dood!
[1:46:47] <%arcaderabbit48> @PatStaresAt The other option was "stay trapped a die"
[1:46:49] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> what if
[1:46:49] <%CatRidder> but you do
[1:46:51] <%aishman> OH NO MIND GOBLINS
[1:46:54] <notsoy> trust that the game designers wouldn't fuck it up that badly
[1:46:55] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpSetIn
[1:46:59] <coreyyotto> since you just saved you might wanna check to see if he's an instant kill or if you can survive a grab
[1:47:00] <%SinnerEbru> patrick your goblins
[1:47:01] <%Pookiedaexzile> That should be a Game
[1:47:03] <+Aikao> You should start the whole game over. POGGERS
[1:47:03] <%RealThiele> L_O_|
[1:47:06] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt have you ever run itno that problem in the last 20 years
[1:47:08] <%kingmemelord97> and now we enter pre end game
[1:47:08] <%G_Thunders> psaGoblin
[1:47:09] <Profmcstevie> Then don't play a single game with limited resources :)
[1:47:09] <%aishman> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[1:47:10] <terrible35> Cheat engine solves all problems pat
[1:47:11] <%Pookiedaexzile> One Boss Fountain, but they don't tell you
[1:47:11] <%DianaTheAscian> THE GOBLINS ARE STARTING
[1:47:12] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, these games are always SWIMMING in ammo on any setting below "excrutiating"
[1:47:13] <GarettLefebvre> Then it's a Half Life crowbar run
[1:47:16] <%NopeBadguy> KNIFE ONLY RUN
[1:47:18] <%tamale_senpai> This character would have looked fine if she was just in the dress or had a better jacket. :/
[1:47:18] <Tracazoid> Best dodge everything or else the mind goblins will take over
[1:47:19] <crimeagentalpha> What if there’s a debuff that eats your ammo?
[1:47:20] <%Garthunox> What if you died there and had to reload the save
[1:47:22] <gluttonousmimic> Damnit!
[1:47:25] <%chrispunchesboulder> just mind goblins
[1:47:28] <BigYanno> You've been using ammo when you could have been not wasting it? tut tut
[1:47:30] <rReizs> pat have you ever run out of ammo on finishing a game
[1:47:32] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt i did the same thing
[1:47:37] <%RealThiele> shitty memory
[1:47:38] <%NopeBadguy> So what's the verdict on this game?
[1:47:40] <%NopeBadguy> Good or bad?
[1:47:45] <gluttonousmimic> Well, at least I'm here for the end.
[1:47:46] <%RayCSmooth> It's no longer mind goblins when you say it out loud Kappa
[1:47:52] <IgniSeth> LUL

[1:47:52] <%NopeBadguy> KNIFE ONLY
[1:47:53] <%kingmemelord97> i loved it
[1:47:56] <%Agami23> thats not true, you always have melee weapons
[1:48:00] <xbb1024> you could just do a knife run
[1:48:01] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt hey...go check out that other directhing *hint hint*
[1:48:05] <%Rumbutt> running completely out of ammo after using the very last bullet to kill the boss would be fucking amazing tho
[1:48:07] <+ScrapKingKeita> Doesn't Silent Hill 1 actually automatically kill the boss if you run out of ammo?
[1:48:11] <%Dakuu75> RE Village was really good about balancing ammo drops. and adjusting them
[1:48:11] <Tracazoid> Crowbars have unlimited ammo
[1:48:11] <studleydoorite> okay then, Pat have you ever not been able to finish a game cause you ran out of ammo?
[1:48:13] <%Mattais88> How about used your last bullet to kill the final boss?
[1:48:15] <%Rumbutt> *last boss
[1:48:16] <%THATGUY_789> you still have ol crowy
[1:48:16] <draca23> @PatStaresAt Knife only runs beg a differ
[1:48:18] <GarettLefebvre> melee weapon it unlimited ammo
[1:48:27] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Dear @PatStaresAt , what do you feed Emlo to keep him so young and healthy? How many kisses do you give him?
[1:48:34] <%kingmemelord97> guess what time it is chat
[1:48:35] <stormhawk9891> Then get good lol
[1:48:38] <%ValHollaYoloson> I think I finished with just enough ammo, and I killed everything.
[1:48:38] <%Monkeyweed21> when in the last 20 years have you actually run out of ammo in a survival horror game
[1:48:38] <%Puhff> then git gud
[1:48:38] <%Agami23> you'll need to get good
[1:48:40] <%DianaTheAscian> are you?
[1:48:42] <%Cerabret100> I will never be good enought o do a knife only run
[1:48:42] <Tracazoid> Get Paige to do it, she can kill anything
[1:48:53] <HaroldDonchee> what

[1:57:25] <gluttonousmimic> Pat's taking his frustration out on the lethal-abled.
[1:57:26] <+MisterAvry> seagulls are kinda bullshit when I see them in Colorado
[1:57:26] <$sleepystardewfarmer> If it makes you feel better, in Japanese they're called "Sea Cats"... they don't live on the sea and they're not even cats :/
[1:57:27] <+CharmSovereign> fish fly in the ocean tho
[1:57:29] <rReizs> flying fish are in the water more than the air
[1:57:29] <lbrownthedestroyer> Sealions are related to bears
[1:57:30] <%epide> what about flying squirls then

[1:57:38] <@Spydurman> @EySoyCoco weird good, if you play it get a guide for the puzzles. Insanely difficult
[1:57:43] <scrumbotime> how do you feel about them calling what is clearly a bread bowl tomato soup a deep dish pizza
[1:57:43] <%Broand> Pats internal list of things which fly and live in the ocean is being heavily rewritten today it seems

[1:57:49] <%asgard147> limesHmm
[1:57:49] <%Puhff> Pat there's a whole Futurama bit about this exact thing with sea land lions
[1:57:50] <%Piemono> Does Pat know Australian Shepards aren't from Australia?
[1:57:50] <%RealThiele> Seagulls are just flying rats they follow trash and water sources

[1:58:12] <BigYanno> Also most "seagulls" aren't seagulls, they're various different species of gull, most of which live by the sea
[1:58:20] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt its your Not Shit Ending area
[1:58:21] <+KingNoodleWalrus> It's not

[1:58:24] <+CharmSovereign> yea lets blame superman
[1:58:26] <%DianaTheAscian> Pat hates the ocean so it makes sense he dons't know much about it

[2:13:02] <%DianaTheAscian> WERE NOT CALLED LANDMANS
[2:13:02] <Omenaire> sealands
[2:13:04] <Man_in_the_Red> and that shit's purple
[2:13:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> how about this: you're stupid and wrong
[2:13:06] <%THATGUY_789> I guess Sea Otters only live in the sea
[2:13:06] <Treasure_Vault> Why not just Gull?
[2:13:06] <Chester_goes_Berserk> But sailors see them hanging out over the sea
[2:13:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> by that logic every bird is a land gull because it's on land
[2:13:07] <Tracazoid> or Trashgull
[2:13:07] <%kingmemelord97> they hunt in the sea pat
[2:13:08] <+MisterAvry> "landgull" doesn't roll off the tongue very well
[2:13:08] <%SwdVengeance> Water Buffalo don't actually live in the water.
[2:13:08] <Profmcstevie> I'll submit your whining to Oxford dictionary
[2:13:08] <%arcaderabbit48> @PatStaresAt But when you look at them from land, they are pointed towards the sea
[2:13:09] <%Axellogic> Seagulls cant Swim
[2:13:09] <%SaiyanShoto> And you're never gonna convince me the name shouldn't be seagulls
[2:13:09] <%Garthunox> Can we go back to bitching about Supes?
[2:13:09] <%CatRidder> seagoal sounds better
[2:13:13] <+FelIian> Hot Dogs ARE sandwiches MiniK
[2:13:13] <%tamale_senpai> Hard to see... Gulls
[2:13:14] <%asgard147> That doesn't roll off the tongue tho Pat limesThink
[2:13:15] <+skm742> It'll really blow your mind that they can't swim either.
[2:13:17] <%anAngryHamster> Strange hill to choose to die on
[2:13:17] <+idyota> Most gulls are by the land tho
[2:13:18] <%SveriSageAdvice> what about Shoregulls since you use them as indicators of nearby shore?
[2:13:18] <xeros720> this is the stupidest argument
[2:13:19] <%SWFanatic> Ty for the poll
[2:13:19] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt examine the stature hand
[2:13:20] <$sleepystardewfarmer> but so many birds live on land
[2:13:21] <theshillman> time to blow out pats ass
[2:13:23] <$realm_forge> Everyone knows seagulls live In highly advanced dilating cities
[2:13:23] <%SuckerPunchSyd> When people see seagulls when they sail they say “Land Ho”
[2:13:23] <+Prism_Zet> @CatRidder seagoal
[2:13:25] <+ladomania> Take the L pat
[2:13:27] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt back by the grave
[2:13:30] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt is the seagull purple Pat?
[2:13:30] <%zarkazeon> to be 100% fair they ARENT called seagulls. just gulls. it's one of those things that got twisted over time.
[2:13:33] <DrStinkers> Are birds at the bay called Bagels then??
[2:13:35] <studleydoorite> I voted No to egg him on :)
[2:13:36] <%Aeoneth> Nono Pat,  the name seagull is a misunderstanding.  It was originall called the C-Gull since it was the 3 version of that particular model
[2:13:37] <akitanito> those 7 votes lol
[2:13:40] <+Nkbzodiac> they exclusively live near the sea, landgull is not descriptive enough
[2:13:40] <AdmiralButtloaf> Are catacombs made from cats or combs Pat
[2:13:43] <+SinisterBroccoli> Have you ever thought that Landgull sounds dumb tho?
[2:13:48] <%arcaderabbit48> I have it on good authority that Superman loves seagulls
[2:13:48] <Blank9> no when they see land they say land ho
[2:13:50] <theshillman> who are the 7 people who are WRONG?
[2:13:53] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt all gulls are land gulls but seagulls go furthest out to sea
[2:13:53] <+3d_pbandj> Anyone know what Seagulls are called in any other language?
[2:13:54] <%Pookiedaexzile> @PatStaresAt What do you call New York From your Perspective, North or South
[2:13:58] <KnightOfTrousers> Boy I can't wait for this topic to come up on the podcast in a couple weeks
[2:13:59] <HaroldDonchee> pat is going to mod those 7 people
[2:14:04] <xeros720> you can tell when people don't watch pat regularly on twitter when they argue with him
[2:14:09] <gluttonousmimic> But they're birds and their main means of travel is flying. Shouldn't they be called Skygulls?
[2:14:09] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt the memo mentioned the statue behind this
[2:14:12] <%Deekman> @patstaresat they’re just called “Gulls” seagulls is a colloquialism
[2:14:15] <%BubbaRands> Pat, does this mean Zangief is British because of his breed?
[2:14:15] <%seththeslime> pat seagulls don't live in caves thats crazy
[2:14:16] <%maenos2> seagulls, stop it now
[2:14:19] <%SpoonheadInExile> @KnightOfTrousers YUP
[2:14:20] <cyb3r_demon> those darn land gulls
[2:14:23] <%asgard147> psaGoblin "Fuckin' Seagulls!"
[2:14:23] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt the finger
[2:14:26] <%kingmemelord97> kiss the statue
[2:14:27] <+Prism_Zet> @xeros720 it is fun to watch those people
[2:14:33] <+idyota> They are called seagulls to differentiate them from gulls that don’t live by the sea
[2:14:34] <%baka_sugoi> pull it
[2:14:36] <%Pookiedaexzile> Wings are shaped like Vs
[2:14:39] <%Pookiedaexzile> V Gulls
[2:14:41] <%kingmemelord97> not just touch it
[2:14:42] <%jinking79> where that Yoda song bout Seagulls
[2:14:44] <%THATGUY_789> this is almost the Dogs don't talk segment
[2:14:48] <%TDotGoat> TDotGoat subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! for your continuing education
[2:14:48] <%arcaderabbit48> I thought you'd put a ring on him or something
[2:14:50] <zerointelligence000> is pat just ghiaccio?
[2:14:53] <theshillman> NOW THERE ARE 9 PEOPLE WHO DONT KNOW WHAT SEAGULLS ARE
[2:14:54] <%MajorCrasher> this poll LUL
[2:14:54] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt that one seems like a bit of a translational iffy true
[2:15:04] <%Pookiedaexzile> Zangief isn't Even half Cow
[2:15:08] <%cooldude69xx> The Gulls win again!
[2:15:08] <%SuckerPunchSyd> 7:1 odds LUL
[2:15:08] <+Nkbzodiac> crazy how landgulls don't live in any landlocked countries
[2:15:08] <%Pookiedaexzile> This is bullshit
[2:15:09] <+Prism_Zet> Pat did you know seagulls are actually amphibious and live underwater most of their lives before they hatch their pupae and emerge into the air flying
[2:15:10] <coreyyotto> @zerointelligence000 yes
[2:15:11] <+battle_of_the_meat> OLD MAN YELLS AT SEAGULLS
[2:15:12] <%PyroOptional> just blame everything on the appropriately named seagulls
[2:15:12] <@ssjklyco> This is how Superman beats Pat in a fight
[2:15:13] <HaroldDonchee> I still think it's dumb they gave you a staple gun when you have a nail gun
[2:15:14] <GarettLefebvre> that's a good poll
[2:15:15] <%toastybites> Mankind knew that they cannot change society. So, instead of reflecting on themselves, they blamed the beasts.
[2:15:21] <akitanito> on a scale of 1 to 10, how mad are you about seagulls
[2:15:25] <%asgard147> no limesOwo
[2:15:31] <gluttonousmimic> Spooky sewer sections!
[2:15:31] <+Prism_Zet> @ssjklyco by knowing about fish organs?
[2:15:38] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt well you aren't getting one for the rest of the areas so make peace with that now
[2:15:38] <%faldin> are maps a consumable?
[2:15:39] <MsYakumo> You do know that Woolie is going to eviscerate you for this, right Pat?
[2:15:40] <TioXyco> pat, do'nt blame the birds because you're mad and wrong
[2:15:40] <%Agami23> because you missed the silent hill 1 sewer map?
[2:15:41] <lostvayne91> makes u nervous doesn't it. sounds like a good choice :3
[2:15:44] <%Bluwizard21> jsut keep it in your head
[2:15:44] <%THATGUY_789> somewhere Seagulls are yolking it up over Pat
[2:15:47] <$realm_forge> Does pat think all rats that swim are otters?
[2:15:49] <%CatRidder> superman named the seagulls to fuck with you
[2:15:55] <wannabemoogle> It's Martha's fault
[2:16:01] <%Garthunox> THAT SEWER HAS A MAP! YOU FOUND IT IN THE LP!"
[2:16:04] <%asgard147> Oh hi buddy! limesKnife
[2:16:04] <$sleepystardewfarmer> woolie's going to get a call on his honeymoon from an irrate pat asking him about sea birds
[2:16:08] <%Arek_1> How hath taxonomists blighted Pat this week?
[2:16:10] <%Starotter70> psaDogchamp

[2:16:16] <zerointelligence000> seagulls won this round

[2:16:58] <%cooldude69xx> You won the poll pat, good work
[2:16:59] <notsoy> there's probably a reason they keep giving you lance ammo
[2:17:01] <%maenos2> @kingmemelord97 a bat
[2:17:06] <+Prism_Zet> @kingmemelord97 otherwise known as SkyRats
[2:17:08] <%hrbeck_> how did Pat vote 11 times in this poll?
[2:17:09] <+CharmSovereign> wtf is a gull
[2:17:10] <+MisterAvry> hehe
[2:17:11] <%Cerabret100> Don't worry about it
[2:17:11] <gluttonousmimic> That 11 people were pity votes.
[2:17:13] <%SWFanatic> Everyone said you were correct
[2:17:15] <@ssjklyco> Are seagulls named right
[2:17:20] <wannabemoogle> No cult calls them selves a cult
[2:17:20] <%THATGUY_789> @kingmemelord97 giant fruit bat
[2:17:22] <notsoy> LOL no, it's so you can keep using it
[2:17:24] <%arcaderabbit48> Why
[2:17:26] <%asgard147> limesThink boss fight?
[2:17:26] <%Deft_Thought> Don't call it a cult on paper, yah idiots
[2:17:27] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt nah its fine
[2:17:29] <@goose_attack_almanac> guys please don't upset the mind goblins
[2:17:30] <%arcaderabbit48> Why would you say that to him
[2:17:30] <%SveriSageAdvice> the poll asked if Seagulls were properly named
[2:17:32] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt whether or not seagulls are named properly, and yes they are
[2:17:37] <%kingmemelord97> no you good
[2:17:38] <+Rofiarf> naah, you are playing efficiently
[2:17:40] <Profmcstevie> "Ammo?...... this must mean not to use this"
[2:17:40] <+CharmSovereign> why arent they just call seabirds
[2:17:41] <%NopeBadguy> YOU'VE BEEN GOBLINED
[2:17:41] <notsoy> when was the last time you fought something that wasn't one of those big claw guys
[2:17:44] <%Piemono> Guys you've activated his mind goblins
[2:17:46] <+ProfessorMorrigan> save for tormented souls 2
[2:17:47] <@goose_attack_almanac> ONE GUY'D
[2:17:48] <DrStinkers> mind goblins in overdrive
[2:17:54] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt the final boss is one of the sorta puzzle just need the basic gun type deals
[2:17:56] <%Monkeyweed21> THAT WAS THE OPPOSITE MESSAGE
[2:17:58] <+Prism_Zet> @goose_attack_almanac they will summon the can eating centipedes if they get upset
[2:18:06] <%Pookiedaexzile> Penguins must Assume the title Seagull
[2:18:07] <KnightOfTrousers> @kingmemelord97 flying foxes are big fruit bats and they're fucking adorable, look up a clip of one eating a banana slice :)
[2:18:10] <coreyyotto> I mean they could be named better but it's common knowledge that they can be used to find nearby land
[2:18:12] <%kingmemelord97> your getting ready to clean house anyone
[2:18:13] <notsoy> THEY KEEP GIVING YOU AMMO SO YOU CAN KEEP KILLING THE BIG GUY
[2:18:17] <%Pookiedaexzile> Ice is Frozen Sea
[2:18:30] <%bassoontyphoon> Pat, there is no such thing as a seagull. The correct term for the species is just “gull “ Seagull was just a term given to them like “Canada Goose”. You’re super right
[2:18:32] <coreyyotto> it's a common trope in books and whatnot
[2:18:35] <+Prism_Zet> water ice
[2:18:48] <DomunDomunDomun> sus
[2:18:57] <wannabemoogle> Fruit bats have big ol long snouts! its adorable to see them eating bananas
[2:19:01] <%kingmemelord97> @bassoontyphoon but it lives by the sea
[2:19:03] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt they're giving you lots of batteries cuz the stun lance counters all the big guys you're running into
[2:19:07] <%moonmintparadise> psaWhat imposter amogus ?
[2:19:14] <Goatllama> "she asked for... sewer water."
[2:19:18] <%THATGUY_789> @charmsovereign that's a generalization
[2:19:20] <%Monkeyweed21> @notsoy this is your fault
[2:19:22] <notsoy> they keep giving it to you BECAUSE you keep running into big guys
[2:19:24] <+KingNoodleWalrus> @PatStaresAt it's fine to use it
[2:19:27] <Profmcstevie> He's reverting back into maximum goblin
[2:19:30] <notsoy> yeah i fucked up LOL
[2:19:30] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt shotgurn or lance, whatever kills it its fine
[2:19:32] <+Rofiarf> pat use your ammo
[2:19:35] <akitanito> don't they die in cattle prod?
[2:19:36] <%bassoontyphoon> @kingmemelord97 not necessarily most have migrated inland along side human settlements
[2:19:47] <notsoy> ZAP HIM
[2:19:48] <akitanito> *in one cattle prod hit
[2:19:56] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt use the ammo
[2:20:00] <%arcaderabbit48> USE THE ZAPPING SYSTEM
[2:20:15] <DracaenaLeaf> deaf enemy
[2:20:18] <%Monkeyweed21> you completely misread that message lol
[2:20:18] <%bassoontyphoon> Zip zap
[2:20:53] <%arcaderabbit48> Wow, that crowbar is useless
[2:20:58] <HaroldDonchee> that could have gone worse
[2:21:05] <notsoy> they keep giving you lance ammo so you can keep killing these big guys
[2:21:06] <%NopeBadguy> You've been one guy'd
[2:21:12] <+Rofiarf> the reason was to use it
[2:21:13] <%tank7013> Pat the guy that said that was trying to tell you that they were giving you the tools to keep fighting, not hint that you needed it for a boss
[2:21:15] <Profmcstevie> You took away the EXACT opposite meaning
[2:21:18] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt he's saying they're giving you the spark for killing these
[2:21:19] <+Prism_Zet> LOL
[2:21:26] <%arcaderabbit48> @PatStaresAt They keep giving you lance ammo because it should be your new primary weapon
[2:21:28] <@goose_attack_almanac> One Guy'd
[2:21:28] <%NopeBadguy> You're being one guy'd
[2:21:31] <+Rofiarf> the reason is to use it!
[2:21:32] <%NopeBadguy> Stop being one guy'd
[2:21:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> as in - the reason is to use it
[2:21:34] <+Prism_Zet> Yeah to not hoard it
[2:21:34] <%Monkeyweed21> they keep giving you lance ammo because they keep throwing big guys at you @PatStaresAt
[2:21:35] <%Agami23> the reason is all the big mother fuckers around
[2:21:37] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt It was a "Hey man, get ready for some FIGHTIN'"
[2:21:38] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt I can promise you you don't need the spark thing for a boss
[2:21:41] <%AncelDeLambert> no the reason was to delete normal enemies so you have IN GENERAL the resources to handle the boss fight
[2:21:42] <Treasure_Vault> Does this game seem as replayable as the classic REs?
[2:21:42] <%SpoonheadInExile> ...so that you'll use it.
[2:21:43] <xbb1024> yeah, so you can use it
[2:21:51] <terrible35> To use
[2:21:51] <+RoByte2> You can't fight the goblins guys
[2:21:51] <coreyyotto> Chat is usually wrong with respect to how to play the game
[2:21:54] <BurdRightsActivist> Is this like a scuffed hills? A Silent Scuff?
[2:21:56] <+CharmSovereign> there's a reason why no game no life wont have a season 2
[2:21:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaWink psaWink psaWink psaWink psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:21:57] <%SinnerEbru> that isnt the worst brain goblin
[2:21:58] <%AncelDeLambert> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:22:02] <Maids4lyfe> yes it does
[2:22:08] <%Monkeyweed21> its the thing you use to counter the big guys
[2:22:12] <%Garthunox> yes it does
[2:22:14] <%MidnightBurst12> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:22:17] <%SpoonheadInExile> Game Devs give you Items so that you will Use them when you play the Game
[2:22:19] <%saadi90> Pat brain bad today
[2:22:24] <+Prism_Zet> There's a reason why they called them Seagulls and not Land gulls
[2:22:30] <@goose_attack_almanac> ICP graffiti
[2:22:36] <%Garthunox> Pat you're a bit stuck in your ways
[2:22:36] <akitanito> befuddled by gulls
[2:22:39] <+Prism_Zet> EXACTLY
[2:22:41] <%MidnightBurst12> they expect you to use it
[2:22:48] <%Pookiedaexzile> We were on land
[2:22:54] <%SWFanatic> Sailors come in every port
[2:22:58] <%SveriSageAdvice> and get horny for manatees
[2:22:59] <%Agami23> why do you sea gull the land when you land gull the sea gull?
[2:23:00] <+Prism_Zet> and fuck mermaids/sea cows
[2:23:00] <+CharmSovereign> hummingbirds hum
[2:23:05] <Profmcstevie> Who do you think named them, early man or the sea faring people
[2:23:06] <bigben01> Is that how fishing works?
[2:23:09] <xeros720> you already busted, but sure, keep doubling down
[2:23:10] <%Kouseo> all of chat is sailors
[2:23:13] <wannabemoogle> Compared to us they are more Sea than we are
[2:23:15] <GarettLefebvre> save room music run
[2:23:15] <WebmanJax> That was a save room.
[2:23:15] <BurdRightsActivist> We're arguing between landgulls and seagulls, so why don't we come to a good middle ground and call them Coastgulls?
[2:23:17] <%BubbaRands> All sailors do is eat hot fish and lie
[2:23:19] <%Cerabret100> the seagulls are in his mind
[2:23:22] <%saadi90> Sailors have cute uniforms though
[2:23:23] <HaroldDonchee> save though
[2:23:24] <+idyota> Why do they call the coast the seaside and not the landslide?
[2:23:28] <DracaenaLeaf> Pineapple is a stupid name Anana is so much better.
[2:23:34] <coreyyotto> Mind Seagulls
[2:23:35] <%arcaderabbit48> Sea goblins
[2:23:35] <%GIGA255> it's a boss fountain. why isnt the boss using it?
[2:23:37] <%Cerabret100> the stairs are back by the other bridge
[2:23:42] <%arcaderabbit48> Mind Gulls
[2:23:44] <+Prism_Zet> @BurdRightsActivist too reasonable!
[2:23:49] <%bravebravesrobin> Pat, help, I have friends that think vaccines hurt your immune system 😐😐 Cheer500
[2:23:53] <%NopeBadguy> @PatStaresAt Get a pen and paper and make your own
[2:23:53] <%SpoonheadInExile> Wish we could turn back time...to the good o'daaaays, when seagulls live on the sea, but now we're stressed out
[2:23:56] <+Prism_Zet> i like Mind Gulls
[2:23:58] <Man_in_the_Red> @BurdRightsActivist because its not worth renaming government drones for the sake of semantics
[2:24:00] <%MugenSandan> Mind Gullblins
[2:24:01] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> I like the ideas of some sailors sitting around and going "Yo lets call them seagulls to fuck with some streamer in 400 years time"
[2:24:03] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Hall wug it
[2:24:09] <BurdRightsActivist> @bravebravesrobin They're not you're friends, stab them.
[2:24:18] <cyb3r_demon> GUN
[2:24:21] <coreyyotto> Mind Gulls are there to help you find your sanity. If you see one in the sky, your sanity is nearby.
[2:24:29] <@goose_attack_almanac> I haven't been in here for a live stream in a while. I keep getting distracted by the flashlight mounted on her jacket being a few frames out of sync with the motion of her steps.
[2:24:30] <%logoth_> the wildburger
[2:24:41] <Gloppie> @bravebravesrobin At least it's not your family like me :(
[2:24:57] <+Prism_Zet> @goose_attack_almanac the shadows are bonkers too, but i like the feel of this a lot so far
[2:24:58] <%SWFanatic> Use your special eyes
[2:25:01] <%arcaderabbit48> Retina scanner????
[2:25:06] <%faldin> shoulda just used twin seagulls
[2:25:13] <+RowenCleric> MY BRAND
[2:25:13] <GhostBrand> @MugenSandan I like the term Mind Gullblins
[2:25:14] <%tank7013> Oh damn
[2:25:17] <%bravebravesrobin> @gloppie 😭
[2:25:19] <@goose_attack_almanac> Use the Wesker twins.
[2:25:29] <%kingmemelord97> OH
[2:25:34] <%kingmemelord97> oh boy
[2:25:36] <cyb3r_demon> goes directly to vault
[2:25:45] <akitanito> emma, pls, sthap
[2:25:47] <+Prism_Zet> She does the opposite of the notes eh
[2:25:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> god this voice acting is so trash lol
[2:25:49] <%logoth_> its morphine time
[2:25:52] <+Rofiarf> save
[2:25:53] <%kingmemelord97> pats gonna love this
[2:25:55] <%PyroOptional> was that a person strung up on the wheel?
[2:25:56] <%NopeBadguy> that voice acting just like completely ripped me out of the atmosphere
[2:25:56] <@goose_attack_almanac> was the voice delivery in direct reference to RE1s quality
[2:25:59] <%tank7013> So who's that flayed corpse on the wheel there? Some dude?
[2:26:02] <cyb3r_demon> reverse psychology real
[2:26:04] <%XzileGaming> Dont tell wakka, I GOTTA TELL WAKKA
[2:26:08] <%GIGA255> that VA really breaks the immersion
[2:26:09] <Aoworth> Reminds me of that Garfield meme "Wonder who that's for :) "
[2:26:10] <%Deft_Thought> She talks like a guard from Metal Gear Solid
[2:26:10] <%SveriSageAdvice> the voice acting is very much an homage to old RE
[2:26:14] <notsoy> yeah the voice acting ABSOLUTELY has to be terrible on purpose
[2:26:15] <%logoth_> DONT NOT TELL WAKKA
[2:26:16] <wannabemoogle> I can't tell if the voice acting is on purpose or not
[2:26:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> It actually sounds like AI text to speech
[2:26:32] <+Rofiarf> why not save though?
[2:26:36] <akitanito> but then you'll know whether you need those ammo
[2:26:37] <notsoy> i extremely doubt they would have let such bad voice acting rock
[2:26:41] <%arcaderabbit48> Quick! Make the level layout even MORE complex!
[2:26:48] <+KaguraRaion> @GIGA255 Guess they wanted to replicate old RE and SH
[2:27:32] <%Monkeyweed21> ah yes the ancient aboriginal retinal scanner
[2:27:40] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt thats just a shortcut back to the office, where you saw the ghost last
[2:28:03] <%arcaderabbit48> Oh yeah, where is that ghost anyway?
[2:28:07] <%logoth_> scrambled by seagulls
[2:28:09] <DracaenaLeaf> and seagulls
[2:28:15] <notsoy> you have generally only needed one zap per big guy, you'll be OK
[2:28:21] <%Monkeyweed21> 7 shots
[2:28:22] <%NopeBadguy> SUPERMAN DID THIS
[2:28:27] <%NopeBadguy> SUPERMAN SCRAMBLED YOUR BRAIN
[2:28:29] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt its purely for big boy enemies don't worry about it
[2:28:29] <%logoth_> That's the true terr-ror. Ammo management
[2:28:34] <%arcaderabbit48> The seagulls made you waste ammo, Pat. It was them, Pat! It was the seagulls all along!!
[2:28:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> 4
[2:28:38] <%Monkeyweed21> you have 7 zap ammos
[2:28:43] <Mister_McDerp> damn you superman!
[2:28:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> you wasted 4 shots on ghost
[2:28:50] <Profmcstevie> How can you be so rocked by the core component of the very genre
[2:28:59] <wannabemoogle> I can't believe Seagulls have done this
[2:29:05] <%saadi90> Superman used his new Mind-drain power on Pat
[2:29:05] <notsoy> at least he used shotgun instead of zapper on the ghost
[2:29:13] <@goose_attack_almanac> mind goblins
[2:29:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> OCD
[2:29:26] <%baka_sugoi> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin

[2:29:41] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt I was the same way man, i underrstand
[2:29:41] <%faldin> why is it called the zapping system when it isnt eletrical?

[2:30:13] <%arcaderabbit48> Is Crazy Talk taller than Pat, or is he Pat-sized but with regular human proportions
[2:30:37] <%kingmemelord97> yes
[2:30:57] <Man_in_the_Red> depends on what power's being used
[2:30:58] <Jetsfantasy> Depends on how wrong Pat is at the time
[2:31:08] <+FelIian> nah he's Gief sized
[2:31:20] <%maskofmichael> [CRAZY TALK] now looks like a Seagull in a Superman costume
[2:31:37] <%Arek_1> atpDance SourPls
[2:31:40] <notsoy> after superman and seagulls, i can't believe i was the straw that broke his back smfh
[2:31:50] <wannabemoogle> I think cray talk is quiet then all of a sudden goes on a rant
[2:31:56] <+Prism_Zet> I like that crazy talk gets larger the BIGGER the lie being corrected is
[2:31:59] <%G_Thunders> For any FFXIV players, is it better to just wait to 80 to try the EX and Savage stuff?
[2:32:03] <Man_in_the_Red> wait, it just occurred to me Crazy Talk made Seagulls into a real entity to spite pat

[2:33:38] <%CatRidder> a milk soup
[2:33:38] <%Bluwizard21> its made with milk
[2:33:38] <matsu_me> milk is just dressing
[2:33:40] <akitanito> but what if you don't pour in milk
[2:33:41] <ocellairs> IS IT FUCKING BAD TAKE PAT DAY
[2:33:41] <Virokwet> salad?
[2:33:41] <%SirGO0SE> a salad? who?
[2:33:42] <%livlinn> psa3guy
[2:33:42] <wannabemoogle> It's cold soup.
[2:33:43] <%TDotGoat> it is obvious
[2:33:43] <Man_in_the_Red> oh, he agrees then
[2:33:43] <StaceMcGate> but what if I eat cereal without milk, then its a salad @PatStaresAt
[2:33:44] <%RigmaroleHM> Never heard the salad argument
[2:33:46] <DusK_The_Stray> I think you meant soup or stew?
[2:33:47] <%faldin> who tf calls cereal a salad
[2:33:47] <%Caped_Eggy> Is coffee juice though?
[2:33:47] <cyb3r_demon> cereal is a chowder
[2:33:49] <%Arek_1> LUL
[2:33:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> OH GOD DAMNIT
[2:33:51] <ocellairs> HOW IS IT EITHER
[2:33:51] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> both are wrong, but i guess soup is closer
[2:33:54] <%KeiganOfAstora> HOT DOG ISA SANDWICH
[2:33:57] <%THATGUY_789> how is it a salad
[2:34:00] <%SWFanatic> You're doing great pat
[2:34:02] <HaroldDonchee> if you put ranch on coco puffs then what is it?
[2:34:03] <+idyota> Cereal is a milkshake
[2:34:05] <%Ynkubus_> And Pat says its okay to flush cereal down the toilet
[2:34:05] <%SirGO0SE> @StaceMcGate then its chips
[2:34:09] <Profmcstevie> Anxiety is stored in the piss
[2:34:09] <wannabemoogle> No with out milk its just dry croutons
[2:34:11] <HotMafia81> Then eat soup without broth.  Go on.  Try it out.
[2:34:11] <%Monkeyweed21> gaspacho is a soup and its cold
[2:34:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> How is cereal a salad?
[2:34:17] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> a hot dog is an American Taco
[2:34:20] <%Fooguwu> it's a taco
[2:34:21] <DusK_The_Stray> In what world could cereal be called a salad?
[2:34:22] <%SveriSageAdvice> its a thing fit between bread
[2:34:29] <@goose_attack_almanac> @HotMafia81 then you have stew
[2:34:30] <%ElkRiverDog> Honestly I've known people who put enough dressing on their salad to make it a soup
[2:34:31] <Madinki> We need art of Superman in a seagull suit And a seagull in a Superman suit.
[2:34:32] <%SveriSageAdvice> it counts as a sandwich
[2:34:33] <+ZoltanBMagnus> considering I don't use milk in my cereal, I consider cereal is trail mix
[2:34:33] <%pokefan9956> agreed. a hot dog is a taco
[2:34:34] <Brostress> I say that SOUP is cereal, and not the other way round!
[2:34:35] <@Spydurman> can a hot dog swim tho?
[2:34:37] <%SpoonheadInExile> My GF tried to tell me that Spaghetti was Pizza.
[2:34:38] <%KeiganOfAstora> meat between two pieces of bread
[2:34:40] <+Prism_Zet> @robosqueeb LOL don't worry, pat didn't think fish had organs, and didn't think they named seagulls correctly cause he thinks sailors lie
[2:34:43] <%SWFanatic> Wait, so is a taco a hotdog?
[2:34:45] <%kingmemelord97> what color is the moon tho
[2:34:45] <%Cn_alpha_02> Hotdog is the poor mans meatball sub.
[2:34:47] <%Cerabret100> the game gets a little wild from here on out
[2:34:47] <Ids560> like when you start getting to pop-tarts being sandwiches is where most cowards will fall off
[2:34:53] <%RigmaroleHM> I think cereal can only be a salad if it has the dried strawberries or something
[2:34:53] <%pokefan9956> a bologna sandwich is the sandwich version of a hotdog
[2:34:57] <%maenos2> pat still harping on seagulls huh
[2:34:58] <+Deadlymuffin5> Luigi's mansion teleportation up in here.
[2:34:58] <HotMafia81> @HotMafia81 Let me rephrase: eat dry soup
[2:35:03] <%SWFanatic> masaka
[2:35:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt I always thought Cerial is a stew as it has more chunks
[2:35:05] <wannabemoogle> What about hot cereal?
[2:35:09] <Profmcstevie> Oh look, the plot finally turned up
[2:35:11] <cyb3r_demon> now your thinking with portals
[2:35:13] <mr_saturday93> magic bullshit
[2:35:15] <%OrangeMDT> Spaghetti is an open-faced sandwich
[2:35:21] <%kingmemelord97> oh it gets better
[2:35:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> A hotdog is meat in a roll. It's totally a sandwich
[2:35:27] <%SirGO0SE> hot cereal, like a sexy lucky charms guy
[2:35:28] <%maenos2> remember guys pat drains cereal in the toilet
[2:35:31] <Man_in_the_Red> @kingmemelord97 depends on what mission your on, could be red, blue, green, etc
[2:35:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> YOU MEAN SHE IS PART OF THE CULT

[2:52:52] <%Mattais88> wait, if she stole her own eye, where'd it go the first time?
[2:52:55] <%ace_cfa44> ace_cfa44 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months! hey pat. Since you're doing an evangelion re watch, I was thinking. For all the praise anno gets for the themes and overall quality, Sadamoto's character designs are super good, like I saw Eva when I was around 5 and remembered them until high school
[2:52:58] <Srthunda> did you just make a keychain out of your own eye?
[2:53:01] <Blank9> but why tho
[2:53:03] <M0untain_wolf> Eye see...
[2:53:06] <%kingmemelord97> @Mattais88 she stole it
[2:53:09] <HaroldDonchee> why would you do that? if you didn't steal it in the first place you would have always had it
[2:53:17] <HotMafia81> Awful lotta waves in that bathtub
[2:53:24] <Parapattern> Your Special Eye
[2:53:28] <luftraumm1> a keychain for a keyblade?
[2:53:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> GRANDFATHER PARADOX
[2:53:38] <%Monkeyweed21> @HaroldDonchee there are 2 retinal scanners you can only be in front of one at a time
[2:53:40] <%Cerabret100> Also you need two eyes very far apart which is hard if they're both in your head
[2:53:43] <%Seyren1986> its like in wow
[2:53:44] <WebmanJax> You need to be in two places at once.
[2:53:50] <%kingmemelord97> AHHH MY MIND
[2:53:51] <+battle_of_the_meat> Bootstrap paradox
[2:53:53] <%Bane_Kaikyo> That's stupid tho?
[2:53:57] <GarettLefebvre> plus you need an eye in front of each scanner
[2:53:59] <%Seyren1986> you have to steal the hat off of the one dude because somebody stole his hat in the past
[2:54:04] <luftraumm1> kairi
[2:54:05] <MechanizedGentleman> unless you didnt steal it and someone ELSE stole it and you just created an alternate timeline
[2:54:08] <%seththeslime> so there is not a timeline where you had both eyes?
[2:54:11] <Manwad> My MIIIIND
[2:54:11] <%moonmintparadise> also its two sensors far away from eachother which is why you attached a hook and line to the eyeball
[2:54:12] <HaroldDonchee> ok that makes sense with the 2 scanners
[2:54:46] <%faldin> but how can you zap them then
[2:54:50] <%logoth_> T H E  W E T
[2:54:51] <%Cerabret100> nope, honestly this game is more SH than RE even though RE gets more billing
[2:54:52] <Profmcstevie> Endless box begone, we have endless pockets

[2:55:43] <vicar_anat> Huh?
[2:55:47] <Parapattern> Who could these girls be???
[2:55:52] <%Cerabret100> The games indie budget jank will not be defeated entirely
[2:56:08] <+KingNoodleWalrus> that's Large Humor, for sure
[2:56:10] <%Mattais88> they probably assume you save every time you get a new roll
[2:56:12] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Hmmm this game is dark
[2:56:13] <notsoy> the michael jordan approach of "fuck them kids" would be well-advised
[2:56:14] <horse_disguised_as_horse> This is some retro vibe jank people are doing
[2:56:20] <MechanizedGentleman> is this the end of the game? feels like it
[2:56:23] <StaceMcGate> Is it time for Pat to scream like a girl?
[2:56:42] <shadowstep1998> so i havent seen the beginning of this game, how did she escape dank sewers as a child
[2:56:42] <+KingNoodleWalrus> you gotta hit the button

[3:02:31] <%Romuken> game reminds me of an oooold game about a girl that inherited an estate after her parents died in a car crash, but evil people are like KILL HER FOR THE HOOOOOUSE.  Includes a fat dumb cannibal, a woman that wants your skin i think, and a man covered in burns that wants...things.
[3:02:31] <Ardailec> These types of games always end in The Lab

[3:45:24] <%Dakuu75> My favorite part of the bible is when Noah dropped a giant drill on Jesus
[3:45:26] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt It's incomplete?
[3:45:29] <greatspaceadventure> did you not play Dead Spac
[3:45:31] <Pyrocitor92> maybe it summoned wrong since he used his own blood?
[3:45:31] <AzureGale> Three times, just like mario
[3:45:33] <%baka_sugoi> DED
[3:45:34] <%watts121> LOL

[3:45:37] <%Ne1son> He's got 2 heads though
[3:45:39] <%silvery_cricket> LIKE A LANCE OF LOGINOUS
[3:45:41] <CrazyMedicine> "You want stars, i'll show you stars"
[3:45:46] <xbb1024> It's doing more then most deities
[3:45:48] <%watts121> Drill Head
[3:45:49] <TioXyco> maybe it's not as powerfull as it should be since it got only one sacrfice
[3:45:51] <%Raikouija> my drill is da drill that will pierce the bio weapon!
[3:45:53] <%arcaderabbit48> And now he has a nice hat
[3:45:54] <%asgard147> RUN
[3:45:56] <ergulor> drillhead
[3:45:58] <zerointelligence000> you guys worshiped a pretty trash god
[3:45:58] <+KingpinLarry> I feel a second form coming
[3:46:00] <%baka_sugoi> But JESUS
[3:46:00] <BurdRightsActivist> Dialogue KEKW
[3:46:00] <%silvery_cricket> CHRISTIANITY GOES BRRRRRRR
[3:46:03] <+Pendragwn> OH NO IT'S THE FINAL DRILL ULTIMATE FORM
[3:46:07] <moe_rondo> wow, is this the secret evangelion ending?
[3:46:08] <AdmiralButtloaf> its not even spinning
[3:46:09] <BurdRightsActivist> CHRISTIANS OH NOOO
[3:46:10] <someyounguy1> did the drill fall out?
[3:46:11] <%Faustgesicht> Where'd the drill go?
[3:46:11] <+RowenCleric> 5 minutes to reach safe minimum distance
[3:46:11] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Where is the drill ?
[3:46:12] <%Dakuu75> what... where drill?
[3:46:13] <+King9k> Whered the drill go?
[3:46:16] <$ImExtremelyManly> wheres the drill
[3:46:16] <BaslerJones> i like that the shotgun is just a pipe shotgun
[3:46:16] <susukouhai> The eldritch boss is nice enough to let u do ur puzzle in peace
[3:46:19] <roundmanhiggins> cut bolt
[3:46:24] <SaltyAzteca> KICK IT
[3:46:24] <%GIGA255> longinus
[3:46:30] <%Dakuu75> if you says so
[3:46:33] <Profmcstevie> Probably a fence around the estate
[3:46:36] <zerointelligence000> maybe for the escape sequence?
[3:46:38] <%anAngryHamster> It feels like like modern takes on RE or SH can nail the gameplay or the story but not both
[3:46:40] <%Faustgesicht> I'm worrying
[3:46:45] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> The mythical drill bit of Longinus and Cassius
[3:46:47] <%watts121> PS1 Spiderman ending
[3:46:48] <%silvery_cricket> Wouldn't the air in this place be like totally unbreathable
[3:46:49] <xeros720> yeah, was thinking about the bolt cutter too
[3:46:53] <Basic_Birch_> Drill of Longinus went home
[3:46:57] <DeusXLogic> I do really like the vocal track of this main theme.
[3:47:07] <CrazyMedicine> no escape sequence? 0/10 LUL
[3:47:09] <%Monkeyweed21> if you dont cut the bolt superman will poop his pants
[3:47:10] <Clyderso> bolt cuttin time
[3:47:12] <%Raikouija> fuk dis shit im out
[3:47:20] <%silvery_cricket> Now back track through the entire game
[3:47:26] <someyounguy1> i do like having to walk all the way out. its a neat and contemplative experience
[3:47:31] <%asgard147> Tell me those bolt cutters arn't for the front door
[3:47:35] <%watts121> her jiggle physics is so funny
[3:47:41] <+KingpinLarry> I usually don't get off work in enough time to see Pat stream, but I'm glad I was able to catch the end of this.
[3:48:03] <%Seyren1986> you probably aren't done yet
[3:48:04] <Profmcstevie> The part the movies always skip, walking out
[3:48:08] <%watts121> if this was a DMC game this would be a timed enemy rush
[3:48:11] <%SWFanatic> pats right, this is metroid
[3:48:12] <%Raikouija> Earthbound did it first
[3:48:12] <%Faustgesicht> Yeah, not just a cutscene
[3:48:12] <$ImExtremelyManly> victory lap
[3:48:13] <zerointelligence000> this feels like it went too well
[3:48:15] <%Dakuu75> -because they're like, basic-ass SFM jiggle physics
[3:48:16] <%turtoh> there's an ending choice here
[3:48:17] <%linSP> what are you gonna do after you kill the monstar, tp out? nah you aint magic
[3:48:23] <%ValHollaYoloson> don't leave through the front door of the house just yet
[3:48:24] <AzureGale> 'cause it's boring
[3:48:28] <%turtoh> I'
[3:48:29] <xbb1024> Or maybe it indicates there are multiple ways to end
[3:48:30] <xeros720> earthbound too as well, but i repeat myself
[3:48:31] <Man_in_the_Red> the escape section of metroid too, but escape scenes arent exactly walking
[3:48:31] <%Bluwizard21> its not over?
[3:48:32] <+Pendragwn> They forgot to have the dramatic countdown so you have to run through it like a jackass
[3:48:33] <Gray_LoFi> Man imagine you got murked by one of those armor suits right at the end
[3:48:44] <%saltenergy> @PatStaresAt does Dark Souls Count for walking out?
[3:48:47] <%MugenSandan> Pat do you want the good ending
[3:48:48] <+ChancellorOfLights> you will love and hate it
[3:48:49] <%silvery_cricket> Its not as great as people say
[3:48:51] <+nivlac_555> you've never played earthbound?
[3:48:52] <%linSP> yeah play earf bun
[3:48:53] <%turtoh> wait
[3:48:53] <Aoworth> I think you need to be really confident about the impression your game made to do a victory lap thing like that
[3:48:54] <%Raikouija> D:
[3:48:59] <+KingNoodleWalrus> Pat the game isn't over
[3:49:00] <$ImExtremelyManly> how dare

[3:49:02] <%NateyBeak> I mean thats fair
[3:49:04] <%aishman> Wait THE GOOD ENDING?!
[3:49:04] <Profmcstevie> Mother 3 is the better game but Earthbounds cool
[3:49:05] <%Dakuu75> I thought Undertale was jsut a better Earth Bound?
[3:49:05] <xeros720> i mean, you like dragon quest alright yeah? it's pretty much dragon quest
[3:49:05] <HeroToxiko> fANS OF muther
[3:49:06] <tuesti> LUL
[3:49:06] <%silvery_cricket> Earthbound is a really good 7.1/10

[3:49:10] <%ValHollaYoloson> welp
[3:49:13] <+Rada150> to be fair beating the monster with a drill isn't that far off, they beat cthulhu by ramming a boat into him
[3:49:15] <%baka_sugoi> FREEDOM
[3:49:16] <%Zebroneath> Played it fairly recently.  Still pretty good.
[3:49:20] <%Bluwizard21> It's not a bad game at all, it just has some crazy mechanics that can be frustrating and confusing
[3:49:20] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Bolt cutter?
[3:49:22] <Man_in_the_Red> Eathbound was very much a time n place thing, Mother 3 however is is still incredible

[3:49:35] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I didn't like Earthbound but liked Mother 3
[3:49:35] <$Quinn_Carter> The bolt cutters were forthe tentacles
[3:49:37] <%luckyturtelle> mother 3 is incredible
[3:49:40] <roundmanhiggins> bolt cutter unlocks ng+?

[3:50:49] <WebmanJax> The bolt cutters were in the first room.
[3:50:53] <%asgard147> What are the bolt cutters for? limesThink
[3:50:53] <Profmcstevie> What's the well done ending
[3:50:57] <%ZephynM> I bought this game and so glad I missed most of it.
[3:50:57] <%watts121> we want Inferno Spicy ending
[3:50:58] <%anAngryHamster> I can't wait for the rare ending
[3:50:59] <Treasure_Vault> Do you need the bolt cutters in the time travel zone?
[3:51:04] <plaest2k> all game endings should be categorised and medium, well done or rar
[3:51:05] <WebmanJax> You probably have to put them back in there.
[3:51:05] <%baka_sugoi> TRUE ENDING MUST GET
[3:51:06] <HaroldDonchee> well you wouldn't be able to get the bolt cutters if you didn't change her back right?

[3:53:17] <%Seyren1986> probably shitty chains
[3:53:18] <someyounguy1> pat do you have the experimental tape?

[4:00:53] <%WutangchickeN> @patstaresat the devs would appreciate you letting em know any issues you find
[4:00:54] <%Raikouija> im so buyinng this
[4:00:54] <AngryAsian5> That was fun
[4:00:55] <%SWFanatic> good game
[4:01:04] <GarettLefebvre> the quick map button was a good addition
[4:01:06] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh my god it is another timeloop game
[4:01:08] <%ValHollaYoloson> especially for the price

[4:01:28] <%Monkeyweed21> now they need to fix the seagull puzzle
[4:01:29] <susukouhai> My soul have been thoroughly tormented by this stream
[4:01:45] <%Raikouija> good shit devs, we made our own resi evil, with blackjack and hookers
[4:01:55] <Profmcstevie> It took some seagulls, ammo goblins and some GAS but we did it
[4:02:12] <GarettLefebvre> weapon quick select would be a nice quality of life addition
[4:02:21] <+Vensha> vargDuane
[4:02:30] <%Bluwizard21> @susukouhai Ikr? how could he still not understand the reasoning behind seagulls being named such
[4:02:35] <+FelIian> maybe have the sound puzzle gramophone repeat whilst you are still in the puzzle? seems annoying and hard to go back and forth
[4:02:48] <$An_Aimless_Avocado> im always an advocate for updating tank controls. but thats just my preference

[4:04:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> But the tank controls are optional.
[4:04:43] <$An_Aimless_Avocado> ^
[4:04:49] <@Ranryu692> @Profmcstevie isn't that a gundam?
[4:04:55] <$An_Aimless_Avocado> @rumtumtugnutz they ARE????

[4:05:41] <+Pendragwn> hi
[4:05:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> @An_Aimless_Avocado Yeah, right at the beginning it shows you how to either double stick or use tank controls
[4:05:48] <%SWFanatic> you did good job
[4:05:59] <$An_Aimless_Avocado> My life is a lie
[4:06:08] <+CarissMcbober> Bad ending you get by just ignoring your sister and leaving to fight the main boss without interacting with her.
[4:06:16] <Profmcstevie> remorse is goofy
[4:06:37] <HaroldDonchee> that would have been cool to see
[4:06:40] <%Mattais88> emma shes anna
[4:06:40] <%peyodogo> that was real fun
[4:06:41] <%faldin> your patrick
[4:06:41] <%Bluwizard21> you're emma
[4:06:56] <%Agami23> that game was super cool, i might buy it just to support the devs

[4:07:04] <Basic_Birch_> you're popola
[4:07:06] <%ValHollaYoloson> another way to get the neutral is by slitting Anna's throat with the knife
[4:07:25] <%livlinn> psaUp psaUp psaUp
[4:07:33] <%rkbinder> what happens if you dont use the antidote but do get past Anna?
[4:07:46] <%ZephynM> ValHollaYoloson That's just full Red Wedding right there.
[4:07:58] <%faldin> dont be friends with the,
[4:08:02] <%faldin> *them
[4:08:06] <+CarissMcbober> Yep, please buy it if you want to see more good quality classic survival horror style games.
[4:08:08] <+RowenCleric> dont be friends with them
[4:08:10] <%SWFanatic> hurts your immune system how?
[4:08:14] <%Raikouija> maybe you can only get the bolt cutters if you slit her throat
[4:08:20] <%ValHollaYoloson> @zephynm I think it's supposed to be a mercy killing, but still not wrong.
[4:08:22] <%Monkeyweed21> slap them until they stop being stupid
[4:08:24] <%ZephynM> @PatStaresAt You being awesome helps make it look extra-awesome. psaDab
[4:08:34] <%ValHollaYoloson> you don't get the bolt cutters killing her
[4:08:37] <%Mattais88> good sundress
[4:08:49] <@SoFarFetched> now Im thinking to The Medium where the protagonist was like "ICutters.....Bolt Cutters"
[4:08:49] <%SWFanatic> oh no

[4:08:57] <Man_in_the_Red> the fact the game suceeded in feeling of a time gone by its worth price of admission alone
