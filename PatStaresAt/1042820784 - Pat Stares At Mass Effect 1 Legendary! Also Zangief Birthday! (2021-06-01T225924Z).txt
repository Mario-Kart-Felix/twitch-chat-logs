[0:18:15] <%AncelDeLambert> that man is LYING to you
[0:18:22] <+even_the_yuenglings> the version in this game is really good
[0:18:22] <deviljhojho_> it still has bad shit in it
[0:18:23] <MarvelousMrD> Objectively wrong
[0:18:26] <+Shockrates20XX> ME3 is *fine*.
[0:18:29] <Meltgar> LUL
[0:18:29] <Ipsenscastle> I'm looking forward to him playing it

[0:18:36] <%AncelDeLambert> ooooh, baby want throw
[0:18:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @anceldelambert ME3 is good except the ending
[0:18:40] <%fat_burtreynolds> The multiplayer was fun
[0:18:40] <Teras_ode> hi gief
[0:18:41] <cannibalskul> It's not great, I didn't even finish it
[0:18:43] <%DJFakie> They certainly did some goofs
[0:18:43] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Story bad game good woolieONEGUY
[0:18:48] <Profmcstevie> And everyone who called us whiny for NOT liking the ending was terrible
[0:18:49] <%toastybites> THE CHILD PAT
[0:18:53] <%Mr_Pylon> Shepard has to save the Indigo Child
[0:18:54] <stealthfart> Multiplayer was good, but it deserved criticism. Well deserved criticism
[0:18:55] <+DizzyGunner> the best thing about ME3 was the MP....
[0:18:58] <aiutare47> Ending bad, rest is fine IMO
[0:19:02] <Archmortal> Red and the fourth extended cut ending both can be argued to have value but holy shit
[0:19:03] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Goddamn star child
[0:19:03] <Sotetsu> I was so pissed off that the beginning of ME3 had you gathering a crew. I just spent an entire game doing that!
[0:19:04] <RedPlasticCup> heres the plan: we fight or we die
[0:19:04] <dauver> ME 3 is 70-75 % good
[0:19:06] <+Shockrates20XX> I also don't like how much Shepard speaks for themselves, without the player choosing the dialogue.
[0:19:07] <%AncelDeLambert> @BallerSwagBro9k Don't you try to lie to me, I remember the Asari homeworld!
[0:19:07] <stantheman_97> i agree 3 is really great until the last, like, hour
[0:19:09] <%FacetiousAF> Choo Chooo HypeBeard
[0:19:09] <GustauveVIII> gameplay first impression is great
[0:19:10] <balthazar758> hey pato
[0:19:14] <%sporeian94> ME3 is good up until the end of the Krogan arc, then you can tell they got pressed for time, then when the quarian arc ends the game falls the fuck apart
[0:19:15] <deviljhojho_> but pat didnt that kid that got his ass kicked by the reaper beam tug at your heartstrings
[0:19:17] <+yunngin> yea I thin mass effect 3 is like majority good
[0:19:19] <28moogles> ME3 works better as a finale to a trilogy playthrough than a standalone game.
[0:19:20] <cgreene64> Dragon Age 2 was fun :(

[0:19:24] <Ipsenscastle> The prologue and ending are the only really terrible bits of the game
[0:19:25] <+YabbaTroll> THE MULTIPLAYER WAS RAD YTHO
[0:19:26] <%valriot> ME3 is a genuinely great game, and they tie up alot of the plot and characters quite well, its a very character focused game
[0:19:26] <peanutdot007> ME3 is mostly good but when it sucks it sucks
[0:19:27] <AthenaAegis> Marauder Shields, never forget Kappa
[0:19:30] <%DJFakie> Multi is good, thank god the Readiness is gone
[0:19:31] <BlindGato> ME3 Multiplayer was GOOD tho
[0:19:38] <%toastybites> ME3 is like climbing Everest and then jumping off a cliff halfway
[0:19:39] <%walternatorz> the good news is the parts you haven't played are better than what you've experienced
[0:19:39] <%blastazoid00> Whats a melonlunch
[0:19:40] <officialpetercetera> Happy BDay Gief!!!
[0:19:42] <%JoshManVGH> Two shitty pieces of bread, it makes the whole sandwitch look bad.
[0:19:42] <xeros720> pretty much vanguard gameplay
[0:19:47] <tanarath> Multiplayer was completely optional. it was also the best part of ME3 by far.
[0:19:48] <%valriot> Genophage and Geth storyline is the best
[0:19:49] <Ipsenscastle> the genophage resolution is so good
[0:19:50] <CrypticMochi> The pay off for several things suck, like that Tali photo or Renegade decisions regarding certain companions.
[0:19:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> AND RANNOCH
[0:19:52] <%AncelDeLambert> Genophage is good, Quarian Homeworld is good. Everything else is ass.
[0:19:55] <%fat_burtreynolds> Melange o shite jaja
[0:19:55] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> the ME3 multiplayer was like unironically good

[0:37:27] <deviljhojho_> @DJFakie oh right...
[0:37:30] <Archmortal> The closest comparison is New Vegas, but that's way more broken than DA2 because of being stuck in a shit engine

[0:41:20] <%JoshManVGH> part of a crazy eugenics program too
[0:41:21] <%ssjklyco> And yet she's less racist than Ashely

[0:41:46] <%Ravioli_Ronin> But she’s hot so it’s morally grey
[0:41:46] <deviljhojho_> the black friend is also a space racist
[0:41:50] <+wizard_of_diamonds> And it takes Miranda and entire another game to be uncomfortable of the fact that reviving Sheperd and trying to control hit a little too close to her homelife
[0:41:50] <Archmortal> Wait, was it you or Woolie saying Earth First about Gundam and Mars
[0:41:53] <%afronooch> her gigantic space ass makes her misunderstood instead of evil tho
[0:41:54] <deviljhojho_> just not racist against humans tho
[0:41:56] <%Strumthund> ME2 made me like a lot of the crew a whole lot less for that reason.
[0:41:57] <donell324> Wait I never new Cerberus was an anagram of neo-nazi's
[0:41:57] <+even_the_yuenglings> miranda unironically has the best power set to take out on missions
[0:42:00] <peanutdot007> She's working for the space neo nazis and somehow not as bad as Ashley
[0:42:06] <deviljhojho_> Evil is stored in the ass
[0:42:07] <wasdsf> @afronooch morally gray

[0:48:44] <deviljhojho_> they would rather have nothing
[0:48:44] <%coreyyotto> FF13 looks stupid good even on a PS3 I don't actually understand how they did it
[0:48:48] <%ScottishMadJacko> I never even thought about that
[0:48:50] <+TheBitingIrish> Yea lol
[0:48:52] <%BigCoffee> 13 is a pretty gorgeous game with no substance

[0:51:12] <%justcallmebobplease> Pat, stop being so off-brand - add like, 90% more gremlin to your take
[0:51:13] <AlphaRayAllen> Imagine fighting a developer's deliberate intention to stop you from taking a game seriously and traveling to majors solely to be a pedophile
[0:51:14] <%MidnightBurst12> of course
[0:51:15] <%BigCoffee> @ChungusQuest So you're saying they're like water or sand? get's in everywhere?
[0:51:17] <%ScottishMadJacko> It makes sense that they don't have voice chat

[0:51:18] <wolfen091> pat knows a little too much about this... major sus
[0:51:22] <+NYCrownlessKing> nothing will end

[0:51:28] <$RealThiele> business as usual
[0:51:29] <Archmortal> The lack of chat interaction is one part of Nintendo's otherwise archaic shit that actually is perfectly justified
[0:51:31] <%Dementedpenguin> People will still buy their games. The end.
[0:51:32] <+NYCrownlessKing> yep
[0:51:38] <xeros720> what's the analogy for that
[0:51:43] <Ipsenscastle> LUL

[0:51:56] <%coreyyotto> *Far Cry
[0:51:56] <+Manband20> Assassin's Creed: Civil War is definitely going to be a thing

[0:51:58] <%fat_burtreynolds> NO RANDY
[0:51:59] <%derpy_platypus> then the hydra's head will regrow with 2 predators
[0:51:59] <%FacetiousAF> boats AND hoes?!

[0:52:14] <%DJFakie> Are you a far seer
[0:52:16] <stealthfart> They will continue to make mid-tier games and I’ll never get Splinter Cell again
[0:52:18] <%einterblathnir> down with Assassin's Creed, bring back Prince Of Persia
[0:52:21] <%ExpressNode> I havent touched Assasin's creed since Unity because of that broken shit at launch

[0:52:52] <+yoshkosh20> COWARD
[0:52:59] <AlphaRayAllen> Just play on easy, fuck it
[0:53:02] <28moogles> The funny thing is all of the Assassin's Creed games have had boats for years but nobody I know plays them long enough to find out or remember.
[0:53:09] <%BigCoffee> Kingmaker is literally the pathfinder 3.75 ruleset
[0:53:12] <ChungusQuest> Ah yes, Mandalore recommendations...that worked so well with Kenshi.
[0:53:13] <$RealThiele> spam that random stat roll button kids
[0:53:14] <deviljhojho_> gimped characters are cursed as fuck
[0:53:23] <stealthfart> @busterrepukken Why must you hurt me with this knowledge?
[0:53:26] <%wembleyttv> Ubisoft games: ctrl v ctrl c
[0:53:26] <+Manband20> Kingmaker is actually pretty easy once you figure it out. Some classes are harder than others, but I'm doing well with it
[0:53:29] <Teras_ode> just play on easy
[0:53:33] <deviljhojho_> the kenshi stream was very entertaining but not for the right reasons
[0:53:37] <%AncelDeLambert> just put respec in your game. Just do it. Having to start over because your build sucks is the worst feeling, just put respec in
[0:53:37] <%Mrbaconator> if you look at guides for pathfinder characters you will pretty much find out how to make characters for kingmaker
[0:53:42] <Dunmarkh> @ChungusQuest mandalore didn't reccomend kenshi
[0:53:43] <%BigCoffee> You can't fail in Kingmaker if you make a regular character without trying to meme
[0:53:43] <deviljhojho_> just play on story mode for extra humiliation
[0:53:43] <+Hannahsmay> hi pat, how are you?
[0:53:45] <who_cares_123> dinner is nearly ready. gonna sit back, get fat and chill watching this
[0:53:48] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt Kingmaker and Wrath of the Righteous have retraining
[0:53:51] <%MisterRockett> Just make a Fighter. Hit stuff.
[0:53:51] <+yoshkosh20> you can build some pretty good characters, but at low lvls anything can basically oneshot ya.
[0:53:56] <deviljhojho_> who the fuck is sseth
[0:53:58] <%Eilocke> same person
[0:53:59] <$RealThiele> 13 str vs 18 100/100
[0:54:02] <TheTakkster> @PatStaresAt What if someone helps you like they did before
[0:54:02] <deviljhojho_> wait, who is mandalore?
[0:54:02] <trianglehat> hey hey people
[0:54:03] <MarvelousMrD> simple answer just get summoning and drown the world in magic wolf corpses
[0:54:04] <Archmortal> ah yes, the good old days when 18 Strength was actually kinda bad, but 18.2 was fantastic
[0:54:04] <%MidnightBurst12> that man is insane
[0:54:05] <%BigCoffee> @AyotoCorp Ohhhh that's good

[0:54:30] <%TIME_PUNCHER> I've never seen Sseth and Mandalore in the same room
[0:54:35] <%StrawberryPantsu> ALL OF THEM ARE UGLY
[0:54:36] <Ipsenscastle> Caves of Qud looks fucking stupid insane
[0:54:37] <%BigCoffee> the DRG one looks like a crap skewr
[0:54:39] <+CammerTime21> sseth got me into Cataclysm
[0:54:40] <%WhereIsWill> these relics look like GARBO
[0:54:40] <$RealThiele> book relics suck
[0:54:43] <Lefanque> SCH is betetr than SMN one
[0:54:44] <$apolitenoob> Wait, the scholar relic is broken?? How??
[0:54:47] <$Ziegsy> Im 24/25 million mettle. the end is in sight
[0:54:48] <%Eilocke> Mandalore covers games I look at and think "this looks weird, but possibly good." Sseth covers games I have never seen in my life
[0:54:50] <Dunmarkh> Qud is pretty good, reccomend waiting for the ui overhaul though
[0:54:50] <%DianaTheAscian> the DRK one is pretty ugly
[0:54:51] <Lefanque> at least their book itself is shiny
[0:54:51] <rampagingcanuck> got my first covid shot today, if I get any super powers ill let you know
[0:54:51] <deviljhojho_> all obscure game guys sound the same to me
[0:54:58] <+alphonseisbest> as a DRK main the DRK's one sucks T_T
[0:54:59] <28moogles> Paladin is good
[0:55:02] <$Ziegsy> the black mage one is sexy
[0:55:03] <Finakala> RDM and DNC are pretty decent
[0:55:07] <$RealThiele> BLM yawn

[0:55:16] <@CreepyPorpoise> Astro one is great matte
[0:55:16] <+GingerStrawhat> I'm a Warrior Pat, Hows the Warrior one?
[0:55:18] <SirVante115> Mch = Double Barrel Focking Shotgun
[0:55:18] <@CreepyPorpoise> >:C
[0:55:19] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> NigelSchnauzerpug subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 52 months, currently on a 52 month streak! Great to finally catch a stream, and happy birthday Zangief. Also, which Mass Effect companion is the best and why is it Garrus?
[0:55:22] <vVAstrAVv> gnb and pld are good
[0:55:27] <%BigCoffee> Good broken or bad broken?
[0:55:30] <Basch71> the monk one looks like a ME3 style Omniblade
[0:55:34] <%Ascethetic> GNB is garbage
[0:55:35] <+alphonseisbest> WHEN WILL DRK GET A RELIC AS GOOD AS HW'S?!!!

[0:55:51] <%DianaTheAscian> Personally I've hated the all the DRK resistance weapons
[0:55:55] <%StrawberryPantsu> Never
[0:55:56] <%BigCoffee> The gunblade one is the first gunblade that isn't tiny
[0:55:59] <%JoshManVGH> RDM looks cool
[0:56:05] <%EmanXLR> ye thats accurate for drg
[0:56:09] <Finakala> When will BRD get a bow as good as the Yoichi Bow Zeta? The answer is never
[0:56:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> Kingmaker has psaBig time-limit-based mind goblins, comparable to Persona deadlines I think, but with D&D travel & rest times.
[0:56:11] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> did e3 really ban the word canada? LUL
[0:56:13] <vVAstrAVv> drg ones cool but like not any cooler than its first phase
[0:56:24] <deviljhojho_> Laughter is the best medicine. Right after the reccomended pills
[0:56:28] <$RealThiele> that bard bow is stupid as hell
[0:56:29] <%DianaTheAscian> are the stormblood relics hard to get?
[0:56:40] <deviljhojho_> its wrex
[0:56:43] <xeros720> (it's wrex)
[0:56:43] <+pre10cious_1> hi Pat, I can hear Zangief snoring lol nickkmUwughost
[0:56:49] <Tracazoid> Wrex
[0:56:50] <%DianaTheAscian> like how bad is the grind on them?
[0:56:51] <%Nekros4442> its wrex
[0:56:53] <stantheman_97> wrex then garrus
[0:56:55] <ape_hawk> liara is the best
[0:56:58] <Wolfstriker121> wrex is super bro
[0:56:59] <%StrawberryPantsu> Garus is space Yosuke
[0:57:03] <%MonkeyTimelord> Mordin.
[0:57:03] <RaidenRising> wrex
[0:57:05] <%patriotrenegade> he's a cop tho
[0:57:05] <MarvelousMrD> yeah but whose the best romance
[0:57:06] <+GingerStrawhat> What about Grunt?
[0:57:06] <%BigCoffee> Legion?
[0:57:07] <AlphaRayAllen> Correct
[0:57:07] <deviljhojho_> ok yeah mordin is fantastic
[0:57:10] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> me3 wrex is a bitch tho
[0:57:10] <%ScottishMadJacko> mordin kicks ass
[0:57:13] <wasdsf> mordin is the turbo bro
[0:57:14] <xeros720> Mordin is real good
[0:57:15] <TheTakkster> Tali
[0:57:16] <%Nekros4442> I would accept mordin
[0:57:17] <Finakala> @DianaTheAscian It's Eureka, and Pagos sucks
[0:57:18] <deviljhojho_> he sings gilbert and sullivan!
[0:57:20] <Ipsenscastle> Mordin is best for 2, Wrex is best in 1
[0:57:20] <tanarath> They're both super solid
[0:57:21] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Wrex is so cool and Mordin supports your desire to fuck
[0:57:21] <%MaraSmug> mordin is amazing
[0:57:23] <%MonkeyTimelord> Gilbert and Sullivan.
[0:57:27] <GustauveVIII> mordin has two different voices actors for each game
[0:57:28] <$RealThiele> mordonally grey
[0:57:43] <%Ravioli_Ronin> They did a good job with all the characters except Kaiden & Ashley
[0:57:45] <+flexin_apex> Wrex is solid
[0:57:46] <%DianaTheAscian> @Finakala oh no
[0:57:48] <dd44dostivei> wrex feels too smart in 2 and too dumb in 3
[0:57:49] <TheTakkster> Imagine playing mass effect and sleeping with a human
[0:57:59] <+SpeedWagonFDN> SpeedWagonFDN subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[0:58:02] <%coreyyotto> o hai doggie
[0:58:05] <%IamGrapes> I think Garrus is my favorite romance becuase the way he bumbles his words and tries hard to figure out the whole cross-species relationship and safety
[0:58:06] <%derpy_platypus> time for war crimes
[0:58:08] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[0:58:10] <%OrangeMDT> Oh no... did Pat finish?
[0:58:11] <+DeadlyPeaks> Totally sums up why I love Tali & Garrus, but never romance them
[0:58:12] <Dunmarkh> ass effect
[0:58:13] <+GingerStrawhat> It's time to actually fly the normandy somewhere
[0:58:20] <AthenaAegis> No Signal Shepard
[0:58:21] <ape_hawk> My favorite pal is Scam Likely

[0:58:25] <%IMDRanged> More Alcove shit
[0:58:25] <$RealThiele> did i miss the cruella recap?
[0:58:28] <Erdrick117> Wait, pat has never played ME3, right? so he's never felt the pain of making the wrong choice and getting his favorite characters killed, has he? that's going to be fun to watch.
[0:58:28] <%lockhead45> Jack is surprisingly one of the best in terms of character especially if you romance her as paragon shep
[0:58:30] <+pre10cious_1> just started ME3, is James gay?🤔
[0:58:31] <s1rcuit> SUPEEDOWAIGON
[0:58:33] <AlphaRayAllen> Wrex is one of those characters that already had his adventure

[1:15:32] <+pre10cious_1> Debrief me Kaidan
[1:15:36] <tanarath> He could have been so much better
[1:15:40] <%blutzwavedave> EH ENGLISH BAY, COMMANDER
[1:15:41] <%EsotericOdyssey> so where do the rest of the crew fuck if Shepard gets his own sexnasium?
[1:15:42] <%Robot_Nixon_> monkaS 👉 👀
[1:15:43] <HollowMan190> wat
[1:15:48] <%cvp5127> cowards
[1:15:49] <sendart> space carth is boring
[1:15:49] <%Mr_Pylon> unfortunately, he's still a boring space carth
[1:15:51] <+HefestoForges> get out of here Carth
[1:15:51] <+GingerStrawhat> It still happens in 3
[1:15:52] <%ItalianWaifu> that would be work though
[1:15:53] <+YabbaTroll> oh did Ashley die yet?
[1:15:53] <knight_verse> GO TO HELL KAIDAN.
[1:15:55] <%Wallabri> YET
[1:15:55] <AlphaRayAllen> Isn't all the dialog in there too?
[1:15:55] <$RealThiele> too much effort
[1:15:55] <trianglehat> no hanar romance :(
[1:15:55] <%derpy_platypus> Lore locked behind sex
[1:15:56] <+GingerStrawhat> yeah that's true
[1:15:56] <Blank9> you can in 3
[1:15:57] <+SinnerEbru> yuuuup
[1:15:58] <+mel0dica> true
[1:15:58] <Gorshum> They really should have.
[1:15:58] <peanutdot007> Wait you have to fuck Carth to talk to him?
[1:15:59] <AlphaRayAllen> For mods?
[1:15:59] <tengel66> Hey, Pat! Enjoying the stream per usual. Have a great afternoon.
[1:15:59] <$lotharrio> ...oh yeah, they should have just unlocked all the sex stuff.
[1:16:01] <%sunsetdisc0> THANK YOU
[1:16:02] <+JaseAdrift> TRUE
[1:16:03] <Broken_Sonex> They gave his face some scruff in this version. Nice shadow.
[1:16:03] <%sporeian94> That would require them to put a lot of effort into the remaster though
[1:16:04] <+robosqueeb> meh
[1:16:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Theres mods
[1:16:06] <%barkon345> wasnt that just Carth?
[1:16:08] <ape_hawk> GMILF
[1:16:08] <AlphaRayAllen> Dr. Booba
[1:16:08] <+HefestoForges> guys carth is a space carth
[1:16:09] <Ipsenscastle> the voice stuff is all there, it seems like a trivial fix
[1:16:09] <Psyramics> then they'd have to make new sex scenes and that would take effort
[1:16:12] <BlueBiscuitGT> TOTALLY, its makes him better than Ashley "they look like animals" Williams
[1:16:13] <ChaosedStar> Playersexual is the way to go
[1:16:14] <+Midashu> do those voice lines even exist in the game?
[1:16:15] <AmuserName> Remember Kaiden's famous post-sex quote, "Joker's waiting for you on the bridge!"
[1:16:17] <coreroma> tru dat
[1:16:19] <Zalapski> can we kill both of them on virmire
[1:16:20] <%BigCoffee> Chakwas is like 50 right?
[1:16:20] <%sporeian94> I should go
[1:16:21] <+senfood> Chakwas is cute! CUTE!
[1:16:21] <Essixian> I'd smash.
[1:16:24] <mikeriffic> There is actually VA lines for same sex stuff in ME and ME2
[1:16:24] <+Twinmin> Found out after I finished ME1 that you cant romance Tali as Femshem.
[1:16:26] <+GingerStrawhat> Don't you wanna bone Carth
[1:16:29] <+FelIian> they didn't change a lot of the actual content tbh, kind of disappointing
[1:16:29] <dero45> i wanna bang the doc
[1:16:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah I don't think Chakwas ever gets new dialogue
[1:16:33] <mikeriffic> That was never used for one reason or another
[1:16:34] <radioamnesiac> happy pride, now touch dicks GayPride
[1:16:34] <+pre10cious_1> Mass Effect: Pansexual Edition
[1:16:36] <stealthfart> So subverse is what Pat wants to play?
[1:16:36] <%EsotericOdyssey> isn't her VA the same voice as the locust queen from gears of war????????
[1:16:40] <%ScottishMadJacko> quick
[1:16:42] <%CoffeeKaiju> pat male shep can romance him tho
[1:16:42] <+FelIian> @Twinmin that's the only reason I didn't go femshep LUL
[1:16:42] <%DiscoMatador> let me romance hot docter you cowards
[1:16:43] <%ItalianWaifu> filled with beer? those purple can are used for alcohol arnt they
[1:16:43] <%EsotericOdyssey> Chakwas, that is
[1:16:44] <GustauveVIII> what alien is pat gonna bone
[1:16:45] <Ipsenscastle> it's way faster now
[1:16:46] <+PenmanLupine> I guess
[1:16:46] <+DeadlyPeaks> Trust me it would be awful. Kaiden is an HR disaster
[1:16:48] <+Punchasaur> Are biotics the force
[1:16:48] <+GingerStrawhat> It's much faster though
[1:16:48] <wasdsf> check out the unit patch on liaras arm when you find her, its literally just gibberish
[1:16:48] <Oxybe> ifn they touch dicks, do they also touch balls?
[1:16:49] <MarvelousMrD> do we get to kill ashley today
[1:16:52] <TheSphereHunter> nice shadow
[1:16:52] <BlueBiscuitGT> SHADOW POWERS
[1:16:53] <BeezusHrist> @EsotericOdyssey Ok, I was just saying that because humans re all the same race/species, what differs is our ethnicities. Cerberus is a racist organization and its members are racists
[1:16:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its crazy how fast Liara goes for the dick
[1:16:55] <%blutzwavedave> Oh that's SO much better
[1:16:55] <%sporeian94> WHERE THE FUCK IS THE GODDAMN TOLIET ON THE SR1
[1:16:55] <%logoth_> its TIME
[1:16:55] <coreroma> I believe they record all the voices
[1:16:56] <+HefestoForges> shadow LUL
[1:16:57] <mikeriffic> There is a mod being worked on that uses the unused dialogue to make same sex stuffs in ME 1 and 2 and carry into 3
[1:16:57] <AlphaRayAllen> TALK TO WREX
[1:17:00] <Wolfstriker121> FUCK OFF ASH
[1:17:00] <Chibean> Shadow? imaMad
[1:17:03] <ChungusQuest> Pat, thanks for teaching me about that crazy Liara alternate dialogue. That shit was bananas.
[1:17:04] <%AbnormalVoid> that
[1:17:06] <Sotetsu> They wanted to keep it true to the original
[1:17:08] <%Lizard0TM> Dr Chawkwas is so weirdly hot
[1:17:08] <+Pequod1> @sporeian94 ashley
[1:17:09] <Ipsenscastle> it used to go slower than a basketball through a snake, in the words of Penny Arcade
[1:17:10] <%Lizard0TM> god damn
[1:17:14] <%RetroCop87> EY
[1:17:14] <%NateyBeak> oh hey its guy! with hat!
[1:17:16] <knight_verse> Kaidan is a council apologist, that alone is more than enough to make my choice.

[1:17:17] <$RealThiele> gimme free stuff
[1:17:17] <+GingerStrawhat> Hey it's the guy that LITTERALLY breaks the economy everytime I play this game

[1:17:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:17:46] <xbb1024> They should have invented a future accent
[1:17:47] <HollowMan190> WE GOTTA PAY?!
[1:17:47] <%EsotericOdyssey> SPACE CAPITALISM
[1:17:47] <knight_verse> NEVER BUY FROM HIM, JUST SELL, BUY FROM THE ACTUAL STORES.
[1:17:48] <hat_under_bread> One of my greatest regrets in gaming was saving Ashley instead of Kaidan.
[1:17:49] <+GingerStrawhat> See I actually really like Engineer Adams
[1:17:50] <+SilverDevilfish> Shouldn't the ALLIANCE pay this man then?
[1:17:50] <CyberKN> This guy never made sense to me
[1:17:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> You are in my ship tho Kappa

[1:17:58] <Chibean> He has to open up his job board

[1:18:02] <MarvelousMrD> thats still such a weird excuse, arent you supposed to have big money connections as a spectre too
[1:18:02] <$RealThiele> im smelling unlocks

[1:18:05] <+even_the_yuenglings> oooohhhh thats what the licenses are for LUL
[1:18:06] <+mai_waifu_> Guys it's space, you bathroom in your pants duh!
[1:18:09] <BlueBiscuitGT> MY BRAND
[1:18:12] <AngryAsian5> Man, Shepard in ME1 really was born yesterday.
[1:18:14] <FightningX> Why does the music sound off pitch?
[1:18:15] <Momofukku> NIKE
[1:18:15] <+GingerStrawhat> Adams always kinda came off as the O'brian or something, just a really nice guy on the ship
[1:18:16] <%captainpodock> Jenkins?
[1:18:16] <twohitgood> space capitalism...but not quite. the licenses need to expire.
[1:18:17] <Ipsenscastle> Alliance Requisitions is so nonsensical
[1:18:21] <Archmortal> it's fun that to make it easier to get the best gear you want to NOT buy licenses except like, one
[1:18:22] <televisedrevolting> Can we replace this guy with the Duke from Resident Evil Village
[1:18:23] <%CalderGaming> @SilverDevilfish not while you're a spectre, maybe
[1:18:26] <AlphaRayAllen> Is this FFXII?
[1:18:27] <+PenmanLupine> buying licenses was so annoying
[1:18:28] <%dankjerri> Fuck beurocracy
[1:18:29] <stantheman_97> shepard what the fuck do you mean "what's a license"?
[1:18:33] <UncleMcgoo> The license mechanic suuucked
[1:18:34] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Wait, I don't remember this. Is this a new edition?
[1:18:35] <%ItalianWaifu> this guy is just running a scam he didnt buy anything himself
[1:18:36] <%jaggstar2020> License peddler, I wish to aquire the loot box license.
[1:18:43] <%dankjerri> shep cant drive
[1:18:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> Why the fuck don't you have a black budget of 1 billion credits?
[1:18:44] <Archmortal> also one level up at a time
[1:18:46] <tanarath> @patstaresat Originally, getting more than the best licenses actually made vendor loot worse, so be careful
[1:18:47] <BeezusHrist> @mai_waifu_ they have element zero, they don't need to wear pressurized suits
[1:18:59] <+Calek> I like how money in this game becomes trivial
[1:19:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> how does he move items quickly if he's always on this ship, you stay in space for so long
[1:19:01] <%garagon31> This weird quasi legal arms dealer on a navy vessel
[1:19:02] <%EsotericOdyssey> WHY THE FUCK IS IT JUST SHOWING YOU BOXES

[1:19:13] <+valiard> that man deserves a name his hustle is Impecable

[1:20:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pat are u gonna go 100% Paragon?
[1:20:34] <Ipsenscastle> Garrus needs to become a Batman

[1:40:43] <Sigma_190_Beta> SING THE SONGS OF THE ROBOTS!
[1:40:44] <PanicSwytch> THEY DIDN'T WANT TO FIGHT
[1:40:44] <AXL808> geth , yes. but is Skynet people?
[1:40:46] <Meekest> Why does the caged robot sing
[1:40:46] <tanarath> 'We had no choice to maintain our slave-based economy, shepard'
[1:40:47] <omglaserbeamspewpew> Step 1: Figure out if AI is sentient. Step 2: Genocide
[1:40:47] <%blutzwavedave> RANNOCH: BECOME HUMAN
[1:40:50] <SaltyAzteca> Something something ELECTRIC SHEEP
[1:40:51] <peanutdot007> Tali defending genocide at a record pace
[1:40:52] <CappuccinoGuil> "Millions upon millions of white people died"
[1:40:53] <%TheMattman1313> ONLY THE QUARIANS DIED
[1:40:53] <%delilah4you> delilah4you subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! Hello Pat you are PAt hello Geif Happy Beefday
[1:40:54] <%joodatious> @Ziegsy what about cows?
[1:40:55] <%JoshManVGH> They HAD to attempt a genocide
[1:40:55] <+Pequod1> "My people have the right to preemptive self defence"
[1:40:59] <%derpy_platypus> Shoulda genocided harder, oops
[1:40:59] <%Ravioli_Ronin> JUST BE FRENS WITH ROBOT
[1:41:00] <BlueLunecy> Tali's probably running off a LOT of revisionist education here
[1:41:01] <nuane> SEVERS YOU RIGHT
[1:41:02] <+Doombarr> who's worse, the quarians or salarians
[1:41:03] <$hattrick61> "hey am i alive?" VERGE OF REBELLION
[1:41:03] <%maskofmichael> Isn't this kind of the plot of the Matrix?
[1:41:04] <+titansloth93> THIS CANNOT CONTINUE
[1:41:05] <T_Sasquatch> @heartlesshealer don't compare that 😂. That's just a fucked mentality
[1:41:07] <%MidnightBurst12> Isn't this just the matrix?
[1:41:07] <Goraka91> MrDestructoid Lucky for your bitch ass we're not petty
[1:41:09] <%wibbwobbler> Too late no longer just machines
[1:41:09] <CappuccinoGuil> Quarians were killed, Geths just died Kappa
[1:41:09] <%Spydurman> they totally left the Quarians alone
[1:41:10] <%Eilocke> "millions of Quarians and an irrelevant number of Geth"
[1:41:13] <wolverinewaswrong> geth did nothing wrong
[1:41:13] <%ScottishMadJacko> yeah they let them go
[1:41:16] <twohitgood> geth won their independence.
[1:41:20] <dero45> they suck
[1:41:24] <xbb1024> they refused to settle on another planet because they wanted their old one back
[1:41:28] <%Ravioli_Ronin> OH NO the Quarrians are the IDF LUL
[1:41:28] <$Ziegsy> @joodatious Oh cows 1000% fear death. bastards are smarter than they look
[1:41:29] <DensityD> geth were purely defensive
[1:41:29] <%dekkitout> "This effort is no longer profitable"
[1:41:30] <ape_hawk> it was
[1:41:31] <$RealThiele> geth ended their capacity for warmaking
[1:41:34] <%Spydurman> Geth won the war
[1:41:35] <T_Sasquatch> Yea definetly
[1:41:37] <%Mr_Pylon> mah home planet tho
[1:41:37] <Sigma_190_Beta> DO YOU HEAR THE ROBOTS SING? SINGING A SONG OF ANGRY ROBOTS? IS IT THE MUSIC OF A PEOPLE
[1:41:37] <Broken_Sonex> Yeah the Geth let them go
[1:41:38] <morningmoondude> Geth super earned their planet
[1:41:39] <%Spydurman> 100%
[1:41:39] <+PenmanLupine> you can see Tali's face a lot more clearly in this version. in the original, her face mask was completely black. I kind of miss that
[1:41:41] <twohitgood> geth won their freedom and defended themselves against genocide.
[1:41:45] <%Order_of_Mystery> @BlueLunecy Absolutely.
[1:41:46] <stealthfart> Elmo
[1:41:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> SERVES YOU RIGHT
[1:41:51] <AlphaRayAllen> STOP DOING ILLEGAL SHIT
[1:41:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> DO IT
[1:41:57] <$RealThiele> any time someone says that its wrong
[1:41:57] <%Monkeyweed21> you had so many other choices
[1:41:58] <wolverinewaswrong> this is why Miranda beats Tali
[1:41:58] <+FelIian> This is all she was told by her people so
[1:41:59] <Erdrick117> I really don't know how anyone can defense the quarians after even this first conversation.
[1:42:00] <Angry_Ev1L> NO U ARE WRONG STARCHILD SAID SO Kappa
[1:42:00] <morningmoondude> Tali is British
[1:42:01] <%barristerofthebar> I mean, I'd fight my roomba if it tried to kick me out of my house
[1:42:01] <SaltyAzteca> They defended themselves
[1:42:02] <%bread_assassin> @PatStaresAt How much of ME3, do you know?
[1:42:02] <+ThomasOfTroy> There were fucking protests
[1:42:03] <Goraka91> Some quarians even sided with the geth and got killed with them
[1:42:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:42:03] <%joodatious> doesn't the geth try to kill lots of other people outside the geth? they aren't innocent they literally attack colonies
[1:42:03] <%SwdVengeance> I really can't wait for Pat to ME3 for this stuff
[1:42:04] <%BigCoffee> ok but its been 300 years, clearly the children where taught badly
[1:42:05] <DensityD> only Commander Shepard can make choices
[1:42:06] <+FelIian> she wouldn't know
[1:42:07] <dero45> many choices and many opportunity
[1:42:08] <TioXyco> no, there was no other choices
[1:42:08] <SlippedDisco> YES YOU DID
[1:42:10] <stantheman_97> quarian propaganda
[1:42:11] <Essixian> THAT IS TOO RAW PAT
[1:42:11] <+CursedNobleman> WRONG
[1:42:11] <BlindGato> ????????
[1:42:12] <tanarath> Pat, did you know that a flotilla is a MILITARY TERM? So they still have an authoritarian government.
[1:42:12] <%captainpodock> Legion best character
[1:42:13] <+fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[1:42:14] <AngryAsian5> Yes you did Tali
[1:42:14] <%JoshManVGH> Communication is the key to good communicating.
[1:42:14] <%shadowsofpain> I do like that Tali learns from Mass effect 1 dialog unlike Garrus
[1:42:16] <Goraka91> UH HUH
[1:42:17] <%derpy_platypus> Stop fighting for your freedom slaves... psaHoldon
[1:42:17] <SmartAssPawn089> Hehehe
[1:42:17] <+rancherobill> nah AI dont have any rights
[1:42:20] <balthazar758> THE CAT agrees
[1:42:21] <Shade075> The Quarian qovernment likely controlled the narative and taught their children
[1:42:25] <Sigma_190_Beta> WHAT?
[1:42:26] <wasdsf> cuz reapers
[1:42:27] <$hattrick61> To be fair to Tali she has been listening to 300 years of propaganda
[1:42:29] <%CalderGaming> of course, Tali will only learn the truth when you do
[1:42:30] <+Pequod1> oh man I forgot how bothsides lib these games can get lmfao
[1:42:31] <Zalapski> ok tali plunging down the rankings here
[1:42:31] <Deasmeister> They almost did anyway
[1:42:31] <%Order_of_Mystery> Bad first impressions.
[1:42:32] <mikeriffic> Tbf she is repeating all the BS he race has raised her with over centuries
[1:42:32] <hat_under_bread> Yeah. Though for Tali in particular she's been fed this propaganda her entire life.
[1:42:33] <SlippedDisco> yeah that'll do it
[1:42:33] <DensityD> in mass effect universe, only commander shepard has the ability to make choices
[1:42:34] <dero45> they just wanted to lurk
[1:42:34] <%sporeian94> Thank god the whole Syntehtic V Oraganic theme isn't some kind of main theme that is horribly mistreated in ME3...
[1:42:35] <$Spydurman> BECAUSE THE GALAXY WOULD KILL THEM
[1:42:35] <+yoshkosh20> BECAUSE YOU TRIED TO MURDER THEM DEAD.
[1:42:35] <nuane> bad first impressions go a long way
[1:42:39] <ChungusQuest> The entire Quarian race was some panicked dude in the kitchen throwing water on a grease fire and thinking "oh man, the Council's gonna kill me!"
[1:42:39] <%whyskeywolfe> Pat if you like an exploration of these kind of topics I cannot reccomend Stellaris enough.
[1:42:40] <%Wallabri> so no one? would try to kill them Tali?!
[1:42:40] <heartlesshealer> I WONDER WHAT THEIR ONLY ORGANIC EXAMPLE IS?
[1:42:43] <ToneBacas> D:
[1:42:43] <DensityD> THE ENEMY
[1:42:43] <%jaggstar2020> can't trust the meatsacks
[1:42:43] <%barristerofthebar> Not a great look for the Geth tho
[1:42:44] <%GarbageNirvana> The quarians were reactionary to every extreme imaginable
[1:42:44] <%JoshManVGH> what does the use of organics play into this?
[1:42:44] <+CyanDeadEye> Geth still decided to have a kill-on-sight policy for organics.
[1:42:46] <%king_wragles> Probably because they only get contacted by Quarians?
[1:42:47] <$lotharrio> "My only regret, is that we didn't kill all the slaves, sooner."
[1:42:47] <%joodatious> Saren is super evil reaper man tho
[1:42:49] <tanarath> WHOPS, I MADE A MISTAKE WITH THE GENOCIDE, IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN
[1:42:49] <SlippedDisco> that's also on you
[1:42:51] <morningmoondude> oh man, Tali is robotcist
[1:42:52] <iosephe> THOSE ROBOTS WERE TERRORISTS
[1:42:52] <+rancherobill> #NOTALLMEATBAGS
[1:42:52] <%afronooch> hmmmmmmm
[1:42:52] <SomeAsianDood> Because they wanted to make their own society?
[1:42:53] <Goraka91> KILL 'EM ALL
[1:42:54] <atema128> ITS ALMOST LIKE SOMEONE TRIED TO GENOCIDE THEM
[1:42:55] <balthazar758> tell em elmo
[1:42:58] <+CursedNobleman> WRONG
[1:42:58] <%Monkeyweed21> NO THEY DONT
[1:42:59] <Louie_Salmon> Literally what could they be other than victims
[1:42:59] <Archmortal> lady I think they mostly wanted to just be alive
[1:43:02] <%barristerofthebar> "we're cool with that one guy who wants to kill all organics too"
[1:43:03] <Yakobro> @PatStaresAt not really, half of them did join sov
[1:43:03] <+even_the_yuenglings> dirty meatsacks MrDestructoid
[1:43:04] <$KnightAsteran> Gonna use a quote from 3 here "the creators have attacked us every time they believeed they had the upper hand"
[1:43:07] <Sigma_190_Beta> DO MORE GENOCIDE SHEPARD
[1:43:07] <BlueBiscuitGT> I wonder, in a timeline where the Geth-Quarian doesn't turn bloody, what the Citadel's response would be.
[1:43:08] <mr_saturday93> Tali sounds like Nier
[1:43:13] <TioXyco> I take this is a renegade run?
[1:43:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> No Inbred babies
[1:43:17] <heartlesshealer> Tali I love you, but you're stupid and indoctrinated
[1:43:19] <CappuccinoGuil> Remember, chat: YOU ARE *NOT* immune to propaganda
[1:43:19] <morningmoondude> Damn is there no one you can dick without getting racist pussy juice??
[1:43:22] <%JoshManVGH> Seems like organics could help answer and learn more about this new "life" thing.
[1:43:23] <Dunmarkh> Tali is just purple ashley fuck!
[1:43:27] <+Ploobie> shut up and agree with the hot alien.
[1:43:33] <+GingerStrawhat> What I like about Tali is that belief and that view point is less built out of Stupidity and more built out of Ignorance
[1:43:35] <%toastybites> @TioXyco he's trying his best but paragon is winning right now
[1:43:35] <SaltyAzteca> @TioXyco Only for Ashley I think
[1:43:37] <T_Sasquatch> Also guys the geth can literally just be rewritten to be bad or good. Is that the type of thing you want running around in your galaxy ??
[1:43:38] <wolverinewaswrong> tali is wayyyy more racist than ashley
[1:43:41] <+FelIian> @KnightAsteran that's in 2 too, if you take Legion to Tali's loyalty mission
[1:43:45] <%Lizard0TM> @Dunmarkh How dare you
[1:43:50] <hat_under_bread> Man, I just want to see a Mass Effect take on the Horatio "species" from Endless Space.
[1:43:52] <AlphaRayAllen> Ashley is a human supremacist, Tali is a Geth racist, totally different
[1:43:54] <Sigma_190_Beta> @Dunmarkh At least Tali is only racist to one race.
[1:43:58] <+yoshkosh20> Tali is morally grey. commits horrible crimes, but she's hot.
[1:44:01] <morningmoondude> Wait a minute, this is just racist ashley pussy juice with purple coloring
[1:44:08] <%ScottishMadJacko> I like talis viewpoint of the geth progressing each game
[1:44:11] <Broken_Sonex> @Dunmarkh But she's got a great ass so it's fine
[1:44:11] <%AzureGale> Crew size = e-peen size got it
[1:44:12] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Not Zionist Tali
[1:44:17] <wolverinewaswrong> yes
[1:44:17] <CappuccinoGuil> Ashley is the "cross the street when an alien is walking her way" racist. Tali is full on Phrenology racist
[1:44:17] <+wah_ha_ha> can't be racist when it's not a race LUL
[1:44:18] <T_Sasquatch> Alot of robo sympathizers in this chat mikkaaOof mikkaaStab mikkaaBonk
[1:44:18] <Dunmarkh> YES
[1:44:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:44:20] <%barristerofthebar> Is it purple?
[1:44:21] <%afronooch> Tali hates geth exclusively, Ashley "has misgivings" about all aliens
[1:44:21] <Essixian> NO
[1:44:22] <%shadowsofpain> Love Tali post ME1, she learn most of this is bullshit
[1:44:22] <%GinAndRoses> yes!
[1:44:22] <Goraka91> @AlphaRayAllen Actually Ashley is just stupid, she hates Cerberus for the supremacist thing
[1:44:22] <%BigCoffee> Robotcism
[1:44:23] <Zalapski> NOT WRONG
[1:44:25] <%ClericOfSparda> PogChamp
[1:44:25] <%Spydurman> YES
[1:44:25] <ergulor> more like just for robots
[1:44:25] <SlippedDisco> sure. but still.
[1:44:25] <SaltyAzteca> SHE GOT HIPS TOO
[1:44:26] <RaidenRising> but hot
[1:44:26] <%justcallmebobplease> She's racist against one race, not a supremacist of her own race
[1:44:26] <%walternatorz> and fewer fingers
[1:44:26] <+FoolsArcade> yes
[1:44:26] <BlueBiscuitGT> And a better character arc
[1:44:27] <+REDtheBEAST> Maybe? LUL
[1:44:27] <$hattrick61> AND HIPS FOR DAYS
[1:44:28] <RLT917> atpRtsd
[1:44:28] <%ssjklyco> And better character design
[1:44:28] <%king_wragles> Why not Liara?
[1:44:29] <Yakobro> evil but cute so who knows?!
[1:44:29] <olaksi> MORALLY GREY
[1:44:29] <+alphonseisbest> YES
[1:44:30] <%justcallmebobplease> So not purple Ashley

[1:44:31] <tanarath> YEP
[1:44:31] <%jaggstar2020> psaUp
[1:44:32] <+Ancopro> morally ambiguous!!!
[1:44:32] <hat_under_bread> Tali has more of an excuse than Ashley.
[1:44:32] <%thedankestmeeme> SHE SOUNDS KAWAIII THO
[1:44:33] <%ClericOfSparda> psaBig psaHoldon
[1:44:33] <+FelIian> She changes though
[1:44:33] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Liara Rise UP
[1:44:35] <%king_wragles> Actually, ya not Liara...
[1:44:35] <ChungusQuest> and a thign gap you could sail the Normandy through
[1:44:36] <Essixian> DON'T YOU DARE COMPARE HER TO ASHLEY YOU HEATHEN
[1:44:37] <%Maids4lyfe> but Tali learns to get better
[1:44:37] <$RealThiele> mystery ashley
[1:44:37] <%joodatious> the modern quarians have every reason to hate the geth as the geth hate the quarians thats LITERALLY THE POINT
[1:44:37] <+GingerStrawhat> I mean I think I would be pretty pissed about a race of robots that I believed chased us off our home world
[1:44:38] <+alphonseisbest> MOSTLY YEH
[1:44:38] <AlphaRayAllen> I SHOULD GO
[1:44:40] <BlueLunecy> And the fat alien ass

[1:44:42] <$SGrim> Asari mad that the frogs are hotter
[1:44:43] <Archmortal> sure is a fucking good thing she gets a character arc
[1:44:43] <Sigma_190_Beta> AND SHE CHANGES HER OPINION HARDER!
[1:44:43] <BeezusHrist> @AlphaRayAllen being a human "supremacist" IS racism. Literally so
[1:44:44] <%DizzyGunner> no, at least tali learns
[1:44:45] <+Pequod1> ZIONIST TALI O NO
[1:44:47] <%Eilocke> Tali's at least racist in an interesting way. she's our lucky racist
[1:44:48] <scrumbotime> It's not RACISM, they're ROBOTS it's roboracism
[1:44:50] <+D00msDayDan> i should go
[1:44:50] <+GingerStrawhat> Again it's something that's built less out of stupidity and more out of Ignorant
[1:44:51] <%Mr_Pylon> The third racist will be Shepard's lucky racist.

[1:45:40] <AngryAsian5> Doesn't Liara explain that her people hate her cause she's "pureblood"?
[1:45:40] <Dabrikishaw> Kaiden in 3 as well
[1:45:40] <+CursedNobleman> morinth is kinda a supremacist
[1:45:41] <hat_under_bread> You just don't talk to Morinth long enough to find out how she's racist
[1:45:42] <+crimson_echidna> Honestly everyone in this series is pretty fucking racist.
[1:45:42] <wolfen091> but morinth is all about that atari genetic destiny shit
[1:45:45] <+black_pariah> That one pilot from 3

[1:45:54] <%toastybites> @Monkeyweed21 you cant bang kasumi tho
[1:45:55] <+FelIian> At least Tali can get out of being a racist
[1:45:55] <+PenmanLupine> Freddie Prince Jr.?
[1:45:55] <%BigCoffee> Liara is like that ivy league girl who's super smart but knows nothing else
[1:45:55] <chancho4tierra> Kasumi have no opinions
[1:45:58] <%Lizard0TM> You can't fuck Kasumi tho
[1:45:58] <%Tman451> Hows the remaster so far?
[1:45:59] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Kaidan tho
[1:46:00] <balthazar758> PixelBob
[1:46:00] <%joodatious> its easy to be racist when your species are so different and live on different planets
[1:46:02] <+Pequod1> not keen on the asari reverse bigotry either
[1:46:03] <dd44dostivei> you know samara is billie eilish'es mom, right?\

[1:46:13] <%sandrews> Kelly? The Psychologist and pa to shep?
[1:46:14] <AXL808> oh no, my WHOLE crew is BIG racist!!!
[1:46:16] <+GingerStrawhat> Actually your SO in Mass Effect 3 Samantha is pretty good
[1:46:16] <$hattrick61> Specifically a sterile vampire supremicist
[1:46:17] <+D00msDayDan> oops! all spacism!
[1:46:19] <%Monkeyweed21> what about Ashley?
[1:46:22] <Sigma_190_Beta> Tali can grow out of being a racist though. And she does it harder than any of the other people @PatStaresAt
[1:46:26] <ChaosedStar> @SlippedDisco 100% doodSad doodBarf
[1:46:28] <+crimson_echidna> Morinth is a literal Fundamentalist if we're being real.
[1:46:29] <chancho4tierra> dont delete 14
[1:46:30] <%afronooch> oh yeah Kelly!
[1:46:31] <$Memdosu> I recently romanced jack for the 1st time in millions if playthroughs, it was awesome
[1:46:35] <Dabrikishaw> "I AM ThE GENETIC DESTINTY OF THE ASARI! NOW LETS TALK ABOUT ALL THE BABIES I CANT HAVE!"
[1:46:36] <+CursedNobleman> @walternatorz yes, unsure why you would though
[1:46:37] <scrumbotime> "We've assembled this multicultural team of racists to save the galaxy"
[1:46:38] <%DizzyGunner> @Monkeyweed21 ashley is the MOST racist
[1:46:38] <%joodatious> @DizzyGunner nah she big racist
[1:46:41] <+crimson_echidna> I mean, Samara. Samara is a literal Asari Fundamentalist
[1:46:45] <%aishman> Why save 14?
[1:46:46] <atema128> Jack’s the best as long as you go Paragon.
[1:46:48] <+PenmanLupine> CODEX TIME
[1:46:53] <Broken_Sonex> Tali is a racist but the hips on these Quarian women though! Look at all that ASS!
[1:46:55] <ape_hawk> TIME TO SAVE THE BLUE LESBIAN
[1:46:55] <%wembleyttv> Question Pat Edi or P3 Aigis? *really easy answer this*
[1:46:56] <+alphonseisbest> why/
[1:46:56] <dd44dostivei> BEFORE YOU TALK TO COUNCIL
[1:46:57] <+alphonseisbest> ?
[1:47:00] <$hattrick61> You cant fuck kelly tho she just shakes her ass in your face for a sec
[1:47:04] <vVAstrAVv> pat deleting saves? i don't understand this world
[1:47:08] <xbb1024> piss like a fuc?
[1:47:09] <%AzureGale> Mass Piss
[1:47:12] <tanarath> @aishman to sidestep a spectre weapon buying bug
[1:47:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pat Pisses At
[1:47:17] <+DeadlyPeaks> I think back in 2007 we all just want to fuck aliens. Garrus being a cop & Tali being racist are just as bad as Ash & Kaiden
[1:47:17] <%wibbwobbler> Never liked the liara romance for some reason
[1:47:18] <Archmortal> @aishman Save 14 is right before becoming a Spectre, to circumvent the Tier VII spectre weapon bug
[1:47:20] <%aishman> Aaaa
[1:47:20] <+zeraux_> fuck piss
[1:47:22] <%walternatorz> @CursedNobleman for the non racist bang of course, but they're probably racist somehow
[1:47:25] <Profmcstevie> Can you leave it on the game off the menu? It's got a great vibe
[1:47:27] <%aishman> Thanks @tanarath
[1:47:30] <SaltyAzteca> Eloquence in that sentence, "piss like a fuck" LUL
[1:47:33] <%barrakuta371> welp just had power outage. Thanks PG&E.
[1:47:35] <Ipsenscastle> well now we all know how much pat needs to piss i guess
[1:47:40] <%lockhead45> jack has the best romance tbh
[1:47:45] <%AzureGale> Piss Effect
[1:47:47] <%afronooch> @wibbwobbler it always felt a bit "forced" to me
[1:47:55] <%joodatious> Tali isn't a racist. she hates the geth for the actions that she was taught about not because of the geth as a "Race" its like saying someone is racist for not liking a specific nation because a past conflict
[1:48:03] <+zeraux_> Fuck Effect
[1:48:03] <+crimson_echidna> Mordin commits borderline genocide but he got a lot of "ha, he sings Gilbert and Sullivan, he's so awesome." lol
[1:48:18] <%dekkitout> So Kaiden- what's his dirty laundry in comparison to the companions
[1:48:23] <+crimson_echidna> @joodatious I mean, that's exactly like Ashley if we're being real.
[1:48:29] <Twin_Hallow> @joodatious aint that the same as ashley
[1:48:33] <%barristerofthebar> @dekkitout He's boring
[1:48:38] <$lotharrio> Non racist HJs for Shephard... Jack, Morinth, Kaidan... that gay mechanic in 3... Liara to a small degree, but I find Asari objectionable due to my own space-racism.
[1:48:41] <+Pequod1> @dekk
[1:48:41] <fritz_dacat> psaDogchamp
[1:48:51] <%dekkitout> @barristerofthebar I can deal with that
[1:48:57] <Therusher> Kaiden got salty and killed one of his trainers I guess?
[1:48:59] <%joodatious> no ashley literally hates aliens as a whole
[1:49:15] <$lotharrio> He doesn't hold it against all Turians though.
[1:49:17] <%joodatious> also the first contact was was like barely a blip of history compared to what happened to the geth.
[1:49:18] <+Pequod1> kaidens like a child soldier or somehing too
[1:49:19] <+DeadlyPeaks> @dekkitout Kaiden makes you wish HR was aboard the Normandy if you’re fem Shep
[1:49:20] <%mield916> yeah but thats fucked up for tali to do all the same
[1:49:20] <Twin_Hallow> nah she was ify on them because the first contact war
[1:49:26] <Twin_Hallow> and the stuff with her family
[1:49:28] <+zeraux_> i wonder what the back of liaras head feels like. it looks moist
[1:49:30] <olaksi> arguing whose space grandpa is least racist
[1:49:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> Space Racism to Asari is tottally justifiable. I dont trust species that can't produce hybrids
[1:49:32] <%joodatious> the turians didn't exile all of humanity off earth
[1:49:39] <+FelIian> as Pat completes more of the game, you'll also she Ash is also just a bitch
[1:49:41] <%AncelDeLambert> The first contact war killed her dad, or something
[1:49:44] <+Pequod1> all those early biotics were pressganged into service
[1:49:44] <+FelIian> see*
[1:49:45] <%afronooch> I think the funniest thing about mass effect is that we'll tolerate specism, but being boring is a death sentence
[1:49:47] <+even_the_yuenglings> ashley "I cant tell the aliens from the animals" williams
[1:49:53] <%lockhead45> space racism is what would happen to like every race realistically tho
[1:49:58] <%dekkitout> So he's Atton at a 4, out of 20
[1:50:21] <%joodatious> Ashley probably compares the skulls of turians to humans to show turians lack of creativity
[1:50:22] <+crimson_echidna> @even_the_yuenglings I mean, forget the floating jellyfish and the elcor looking like space hippos
[1:50:22] <Twin_Hallow> yeah space racism is pretty realistic defiantly with the turians and human
[1:50:23] <+FelIian> it's realistic, doesn't mean I like it
[1:50:27] <Twin_Hallow> first contact war and ect
[1:50:28] <SomeAsianDood> Unless you're asari where you're viewed as bangable by all sentient races
[1:50:29] <Broken_Sonex> @afronooch Hey man, being boring just worse. It just is
[1:50:43] <%MugenSandan> okay but space FETISHISM WHEN
[1:50:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> Ashley"If you come in peace I will make you into Pieces"Williams
[1:50:47] <kikoeru_san> Ash is just racist through and through, if she makes it to 3 she doesn't change at all
[1:50:49] <+zeraux_> he is pissing like a fuck
[1:50:59] <Teras_ode> it's almost like the game is trying to make a point that being a racist isn't exclusive to just one particular group/species
[1:51:10] <%sporeian94> I'm honestly worried pat has diabetes he pisses so much
[1:51:10] <Twin_Hallow> she isnt the same in 3
[1:51:10] <%AncelDeLambert> he's probably letting Zang out to pee
[1:51:11] <+zeraux_> hey wait cant you totally cuck joker?
[1:51:17] <BlueBiscuitGT> I think there's also Thane, I can't remember if he's racist too or not
[1:51:21] <%MugenSandan> there's gotta be someone who is like "I need to get in bed with a salarian"
[1:51:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> Ashely'No space for the Alien Race'Williams
[1:51:28] <+FelIian> @Twin_Hallow Yea she bimbo'd up
[1:51:33] <%DizzyGunner> @kikoeru_san that's what im saying! at least if you save both quarians and geth tali learns!
[1:51:39] <%joodatious> @kikoeru_san EXACTLY, literally everyone elses problems get resolved in some manner even wrex and mordin for gods sake but ashley literally gets worse over time
[1:51:41] <%sporeian94> If you're femshep you can hit on joker in 3 and he just goes "Nah I don't think of you like that"
[1:51:46] <%joodatious> ashley ages like milk
[1:51:53] <Broken_Sonex> @FelIian Like look at her lips in 3 Jesus lady
[1:51:53] <%lockhead45> Salarians arent overly racism they just sorta are mostly insensitive due to the oure logical thinking 9/10 times
[1:51:55] <theredfox930000> pat really knows how to get down
[1:51:56] <SaltyAzteca> Heya No Signal HeyGuys
[1:51:57] <%HairballCT> psaBig NO SIGNAL

[1:54:14] <+smuggleruncle> well fuck me sideways
[1:54:16] <Jaysky> Perhaps we are all but sovereigns on the inside
[1:54:18] <%sporeian94> Top right Pat
[1:54:19] <%JamesCorck> Hey Pat, are you going to try and glitch the tank through the crevase?
[1:54:20] <mesamus> athens
[1:54:21] <Teras_ode> Look at these greek names
[1:54:23] <ivanmistwalker> Liara <3
[1:54:23] <+D00msDayDan> save liara for last so she goes crazy in that prothean jail
[1:54:24] <Samurai_Tchan> FINDA LIARA
[1:54:27] <stantheman_97> the reapers are such assholes
[1:54:27] <$lotharrio> Pick up Liara for some internalized racism tentacle-jobs.
[1:54:28] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Is sovereign the Mephisto of mass effect
[1:54:28] <%joodatious> Baterians literally just suck shit
[1:54:29] <%templar010> Game confirmed for a Reaper
[1:54:32] <BlueBiscuitGT> MAKO TIME!
[1:54:35] <%sporeian94> THE GREATEST VEHicle iN THE ENTIRE SERIES
[1:54:35] <DensityD> Joker is such a good helmsman
[1:54:35] <SlippedDisco> oh hell yeah krogan warlord. best boy.
[1:54:36] <SaltyAzteca> And fight the Maws
[1:54:37] <$lotharrio> MAKO! MAKO! MAKO!
[1:54:39] <ToneBacas> the Mako with the old controls?
[1:54:40] <%afronooch> isn't she sleeping if save her last?
[1:54:40] <+brandonsbetow> knosos
[1:54:45] <Profmcstevie> The Mako.... yay~
[1:54:46] <%wibbwobbler> So indoctrinated
[1:54:46] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt Apparently the council room is also Shaped like Sovereign
[1:54:47] <SomeAsianDood> Mako so much fun LUL
[1:54:48] <Samurai_Tchan> LIARA is the only alien that i need
[1:54:49] <%sporeian94> THe Mako is better than the hammerhead and both those are vastly superior to the Nomad
[1:54:50] <%DJFakie> Fighting enemies in the Mako doesn't reduce XP anymore
[1:54:54] <%joodatious> the best baterians in mass effect are in ME3 multiplayer when you can beat up dudes with your shotgun
[1:54:55] <BlueBiscuitGT> A part of me really misses the MAKO
[1:54:57] <ioci2112> "after every cycle we spend decades erasing our presence from the galaxy, but we also shaped a nebula like us because somebody is gonna freak the fuck out when they see that"
[1:55:00] <%JamesCorck> If you glitch the Mako through the crevase halfway through the level, the final boss of said level bugs out XD
[1:55:03] <+FelIian> that map in ME1 is annoying because of no completion % or quest markers, ME2 is annoying because of the probing and controls (on PC)
[1:55:08] <%AzureGale> Uh-oh, better get Mako
[1:55:09] <+JaseAdrift> if her name ain't Tali I dont wanna talk
[1:55:14] <%sporeian94> Pat it's the top right system
[1:55:15] <%toastybites> I can
[1:55:26] <BlueBiscuitGT> IIRC its either Knossos or Athens
[1:55:27] <+zeraux_> the load times are fucking astounding
[1:55:29] <%captainpodock> Knossos
[1:55:30] <Teras_ode> I remember farming more xp from maws by doing the killing blow on foot
[1:55:30] <%toastybites> I can't wait till Pat shoots drones obsessively
[1:55:32] <omglaserbeamspewpew> It would be fun if a space game took into account time dilation from everyone travelling at different speeds. "There's an invasion coming!" "When? Are you in my future or my past?" "I dunno. I know Henry is in my past. Are you in Henry's present?"
[1:55:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> Reading DansGame
[1:55:39] <%Treuan> I love the lore
[1:55:41] <tanarath> It is!
[1:55:42] <+brandonsbetow> Knossos
[1:55:44] <%JoshManVGH> @djfakie this has made the Mako so handy
[1:55:46] <$lotharrio> Space is cool.
[1:55:48] <%sunsetdisc0> i hope bioware doesnt just sweep andromeda under the rug going forward. i really like drack and jaal
[1:55:51] <+JaseAdrift> I never read a single one of thosw
[1:55:51] <stantheman_97> unnecessary but well appreciated
[1:55:51] <BlueBiscuitGT> An intern wrote that I bet
[1:55:52] <+PenmanLupine> that planet is shaped like Sovereign
[1:55:54] <Profmcstevie> The information a space faring species would know
[1:55:59] <Teras_ode> SMOrc but why read?
[1:55:59] <%AzureGale> But what if you could shoot probes at the planet
[1:56:00] <Samurai_Tchan> why the music have those 80s distortion w
[1:56:09] <%templar010> I love reading all the planet entries
[1:56:19] <CrypticMochi> So I was looking up the changes they did for LE. For the mako lava isn’t an instant death and they removes the xp penalty for mako kills, also made it less bouncy.
[1:56:23] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Carbo and Nitro?
[1:56:25] <%lockhead45> this the Thresher planet?
[1:56:38] <BlueBiscuitGT> Reminds me of ES2 planet descriptions
[1:56:43] <$lotharrio> Mehka-lehka-hi?
[1:56:44] <+brandonsbetow> yes
[1:56:58] <+CyanDeadEye> Therum
[1:56:59] <+black_pariah> @Samurai_Tchan  I think that's because of the stream
[1:56:59] <tanarath> IT REALLY IS
[1:57:04] <DensityD> are you on ligma, candice?
[1:57:05] <%dekkitout> I'm now thinking of all gas giants as dork stars
[1:57:05] <AmuserName> @lockhead45 LOTS of planets are Thresher Planets! :)
[1:57:06] <$lotharrio> Therum sounds right.
[1:57:16] <%DJFakie> Unknown planet in the cluster for bonus stuff
[1:57:17] <televisedrevolting> @crypticmochi As someone who has only played LE, it was MORE bouncy in the original?
[1:57:18] <Samurai_Tchan> she appears in the map
[1:57:18] <RedPlasticCup> he knows
[1:57:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> @crypticmochi Thank fuck. I remember getting out of the Mako for every kill to quell the mind goblins
[1:57:23] <%sporeian94> Fun fact Therum was suppose to be a big mining colony hub world that got cut and just repurposed into a mako level
[1:57:32] <+zeraux_> this is the equivalent of
[1:57:34] <+FelIian> @PatStaresAt don't forget to check the asteroid belts
[1:57:38] <T_Sasquatch> There's a place in one of the games that has a gigantic sun. Its rad
[1:57:39] <SaltyAzteca> This mission was rough for me when I first played it
[1:57:39] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Fly to Bo-Fa
[1:57:41] <$RealThiele> makes me miss star control
[1:57:44] <%UvBenServed> Heavy Metal? PogChamp
[1:57:44] <Broken_Sonex> It as a picture. That's how you know you can land there
[1:57:57] <%sporeian94> They removed the sparkle from the remaster
[1:57:58] <%DJFakie> Inner belt
[1:58:01] <dd44dostivei> @televisedrevolting it was like driving a hot air baloon
[1:58:05] <%lockhead45> survey the planets
[1:58:06] <seancbo> I'm pretty sure surveying is free, no?
[1:58:07] <CrypticMochi> You kinda bounced so much you would sometimes lose speed
[1:58:08] <mesamus> inner
[1:58:11] <%sporeian94> the asteroids that you can scan all got the sparkle removed
[1:58:13] <Archmortal> it's like nearly every belt, except when there are two and then it's only one of them
[1:58:15] <Samurai_Tchan> no asteroids, stop the mind goblons
[1:58:18] <%twistedj3ster> Couldn't you just send down a probe?
[1:58:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> All of Them Kappa
[1:58:23] <$lotharrio> Potassium!
[1:58:26] <televisedrevolting> @dd44dostivei Christ I can't imagine how it could be worse.

[1:58:59] <AmuserName> What a beautiful OST.
[1:59:04] <SaltyAzteca> YEYEYEYEEY
[1:59:12] <%ScottishMadJacko> the boost is nice
[1:59:13] <T_Sasquatch> I don't think og mako was that bad
[1:59:18] <auraofdawn> DO A FLIP
[1:59:21] <Samurai_Tchan> imagine having a car like this
[1:59:22] <+athuramn> Liara indeed @stantheman_97
[1:59:24] <%JoshManVGH> Boost!
[1:59:26] <%DJFakie> You can shoot through the Mako while you're zoomed in
[1:59:27] <CrypticMochi> Oh right they also added boosters that have a separate cooldown from the jets
[1:59:29] <%dekkitout> Sick burnouts plz
[1:59:30] <stantheman_97> i love the mako i wish it was done a bit better
[1:59:31] <SomeAsianDood> Man what is seth green doing nowadays
[1:59:31] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> theres some light autoaim on the mako guns now, though i dont remember if that was in the original
[1:59:31] <Broken_Sonex> We are gonna get the best Wrex line in this entire game after we rescue Liara
[1:59:32] <iosephe> JUMP JETS
[1:59:34] <%ScottishMadJacko> L1
[1:59:34] <Teras_ode> hey secondary fire actually sounds better now
[1:59:36] <SomeAsianDood> Getting high with Rogen?
[1:59:40] <morningmoondude> they changed nothing but a few stats and the PC keys
[1:59:45] <%ScottishMadJacko> yeah
[1:59:49] <fritz_dacat> its a landmaster
[1:59:49] <AmuserName> THAT'S ALL THAT WAS NEEDED LUL
[1:59:49] <%templar010> @PatStaresAt Sorry, sprint. No those boosters werent in the original
[1:59:50] <+TheotherKristian> Which handles better: This mako or Andromeda Mako??
[1:59:51] <$SGrim> So they ruined it
[1:59:51] <%JamesCorck> Sick Nasty!
[1:59:55] <%Ynkubus_> Now rove around and park the mako on your enemies!
[1:59:55] <+Punchasaur> Big effect
[1:59:57] <tanarath> that's bad
[1:59:59] <dd44dostivei> boosters are new
[2:00:01] <+MightyDuckShoes> !uptime
[2:00:02] <@Moobot> @MightyDuckShoes I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 20s.
[2:00:05] <ioci2112> also the boost is now
[2:00:07] <turtlegryphon> pat please show me your characters face I just got here and saw it for a second it looks fabulous
[2:00:07] <%Ranryu692> tank controls?
[2:00:08] <%sporeian94> YES TURN IT OFF PAT WE NEED OG CONTROLS
[2:00:09] <$lotharrio> Pat is instantly attracted to calibration. Kappa
[2:00:10] <Broken_Sonex> It's all that was needed, really
[2:00:10] <%ScottishMadJacko> I prefer old mako
[2:00:11] <ioci2112> new
[2:00:17] <+D00msDayDan> i always used the dev console to give the mako infinite jump juice
[2:00:18] <$SGrim> @dd44dostivei the original had jump jets too
[2:00:18] <%DJFakie> That's only good for M+K controls
[2:00:19] <%joodatious> it does seem heavier which is nice
[2:00:21] <%JoshManVGH> Bottom heavier too. boosters yeah it's good stuff.
[2:00:22] <CrypticMochi> They made actually shoot where it aims now
[2:00:22] <Teras_ode> try to jump with it
[2:00:23] <mesamus> this song reminds me of the ancients city in ff7
[2:00:27] <Shatterthought> LUL
[2:00:32] <%Monkeyweed21> TANK CONTROLS
[2:00:32] <korolev787> Oh the Mako. I’m sort of happy that Bioware kept most of its weird physics. It’s objectively terrible, but it’s a nostalgia-inducing terrible
[2:00:33] <%sporeian94> it really did
[2:00:35] <SaltyAzteca> Where are my Thresher Maws
[2:00:37] <AShinyVagikarp> Tank controls FeelsAmazingMan
[2:00:39] <%joodatious> this actually looks pretty nice
[2:00:40] <BlueBiscuitGT> I remember the lava
[2:00:41] <Ipsenscastle> the lava looks so much better now
[2:00:43] <Therusher> Pat doesn't like tank controls confirmed
[2:00:43] <+D00msDayDan> it's not halo if you're not steering with the camera
[2:00:44] <QuestlordJake> it might've been the same before but the auto cannon is absolutely pinpoint
[2:00:47] <+FierceDeityGabe> No more instant kill
[2:00:49] <Teras_ode> LUL
[2:00:50] <Ipsenscastle> they fixed it
[2:00:50] <%AzureGale> DED
[2:00:52] <%templar010> LUL
[2:00:52] <%JoshManVGH> Flipping it IS still possible, but it seems like it's harder to do.
[2:00:54] <TioXyco> LUL
[2:00:54] <+CursedNobleman> LUL
[2:00:55] <Enajy314> LUL
[2:00:56] <seancbo> I wish this had a Halo style reversion button
[2:00:57] <$Memdosu> they changed it
[2:00:58] <+ThomasOfTroy> You also won't die if you flip over
[2:00:59] <%templar010> Yeah it was instadeath
[2:01:02] <SaltyAzteca> I remember that LUL
[2:01:06] <Samurai_Tchan> you could walk on lava
[2:01:15] <Mattais88> Wow virmire looks pretty good
[2:01:21] <+ThomasOfTroy> It was half
[2:01:21] <T_Sasquatch> That lens flare
[2:01:22] <%templar010> NOT ANYMORE
[2:01:24] <%ScottishMadJacko> you get proper xp now
[2:01:29] <%AncelDeLambert> Let's go get the mousey one that's inexplicably kill crazy despite being a HISTORIAN
[2:01:33] <televisedrevolting> That's awful.
[2:01:34] <Mattais88> On foot Thresher maw kills
[2:01:35] <Teras_ode> yeah I always killed maws on foot because of that
[2:01:38] <%joodatious> is legendary edition worth getting?
[2:01:43] <Profmcstevie> So they made it annoying, and now it's fun
[2:01:45] <CrypticMochi> 50%
[2:01:47] <Profmcstevie> cool designers
[2:01:55] <%JamesCorck> Yepp.
[2:01:57] <%sporeian94> Pat you better do the glitch that allows you to clip the mako through that whole in the wall at the end here
[2:01:58] <ape_hawk> i mean, this IS a charted planet
[2:02:01] <BlueBiscuitGT> Yeah
[2:02:02] <CrypticMochi> 40% on high difficulties
[2:02:02] <%templar010> @PatStaresAt I did all of the survey assignments, the uncharted worlds look way better
[2:02:07] <%Varlinator> Fuck! I'm late - how much have I missed gang?
[2:02:14] <televisedrevolting> @joodatious As someone whose sole experience with Mass Effect is the Legendary Edition, it's been pretty fun.
[2:02:14] <seancbo> The forward boost is sweet
[2:02:18] <%joodatious> it always looked so ugly i hated it. so much nicer now
[2:02:24] <+MightyDuckShoes> Hey, yall. I'm too much of a broke bitch to have a good pc for this. Is the Xbox One version look alright or would it be entirely pointless to get it on the platform?
[2:02:32] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> I KNEW i wasnt imagining it, i had a harder time climbing mountains with the mako than i remembered
[2:02:32] <%Varlinator> !uptime

[2:02:46] <stantheman_97> oh fuck they totally look like covenant ships i never noticed
[2:02:46] <+D00msDayDan> i don't like the new sounds on the mako's guns
[2:02:47] <Broken_Sonex> They also changed the sound of the gun. I like it

[2:03:57] <%Order_of_Mystery> the mako is so much fun
[2:03:59] <+even_the_yuenglings> side path
[2:04:00] <Teras_ode> Elmo wants to play
[2:04:01] <%toastybites> what if the Geth turret was sentient
[2:04:01] <%sporeian94> you have to go around
[2:04:02] <wolfen091> damnit
[2:04:02] <+Calek> you have to run into it real hard
[2:04:04] <%ScottishMadJacko> from inside
[2:04:05] <$RealThiele> elmo is trying to post racist tweets again
[2:04:07] <iosephe> wrex
[2:04:13] <Sigma_190_Beta> Have to go around.
[2:04:17] <CrypticMochi> Mako also has faster shield regen and you can repair while moving
[2:04:18] <%SveriSageAdvice> @wolfen091 he just mentioned they fixed it so you get the same exp as on foot
[2:04:18] <+D00msDayDan> wrex just told you to go around
[2:04:21] <peanutdot007> Why isn't he wearing his helmet on this alien lava planet?
[2:04:21] <Samurai_Tchan> TALI IS INSANE
[2:04:23] <omglaserbeamspewpew> She can't wait to genocide
[2:04:24] <%DJFakie> Damn, gettin' loud Tali
[2:04:26] <xbb1024> everyone is hostile to Tali
[2:04:27] <Teras_ode> but thou must take this route
[2:04:28] <SaltyAzteca> ehhh medium sized
[2:04:28] <+brandonsbetow> Wait, Mako has boost!?
[2:04:29] <%MidnightBurst12> fat?
[2:04:30] <$lotharrio> Tali is unable to stop talking about killing Geth, even when they're all dead.
[2:04:30] <seancbo> Jesus, I forgot how much Tali sounds like a japanese 8 year old in the first game
[2:04:33] <AmuserName> DEXTRO-MILKIES
[2:04:38] <+MightyDuckShoes> She's more ass than tits
[2:04:40] <+athuramn> she's talking about the toaster
[2:04:40] <balthazar758> it's the purple power
[2:04:41] <%GinAndRoses> meow

[2:04:43] <%furiousfurioso> psaGib
[2:04:43] <%AzureGale> MEOOOOOOOW
[2:04:46] <%DJFakie> Elmo's saying "go around dude"
[2:04:47] <BlueBiscuitGT> Screming kitty
[2:04:47] <%DianaTheAscian> are they purple?
[2:04:47] <BlackIronClam> He has spoken!
[2:04:47] <%Blackmage9999> psaPorgmo

[2:05:04] <Mattais88> Are quarians even mammals?
[2:05:07] <$lotharrio> Never not the most Charming.
[2:05:09] <AmuserName> nyannPOG DEXTRO UDDERS nyannPOG
[2:05:10] <+Calek> DO YOU EVEN LIFT BRO
[2:05:13] <tanarath> Get cool powers
[2:05:13] <%Treuan> Pat lifts
[2:05:16] <%joodatious> tali sounds the worse in ME1, people really only started loving her in 2 because of the better VA work and uh "design"
[2:05:17] <SilverFaustX> switch pro might get shown tomorrow
[2:05:18] <BlackIronClam> Elmo has many opinions about the mass effect
[2:05:27] <%cvp5127> now you lift bro
[2:05:31] <%DJFakie> Spectre Training gives revives
[2:05:35] <+D00msDayDan> now you can fuck around with crates in non-combat areas
[2:05:36] <Archmortal> Adrenaline Burst is so good
[2:05:42] <KNYGHT87> why is he balding 🤣
[2:05:46] <Sigma_190_Beta> Spectre Training is pretty good.
[2:05:50] <tanarath> Unity is ok
[2:05:51] <CrypticMochi> Does master lift still work on a colossus?
[2:05:53] <%Order_of_Mystery> god this music is Aces
[2:06:00] <tanarath> @knyght87 it's pat
[2:06:11] <%DJFakie> ME3 let you revive without kits, it's really nice
[2:06:26] <%Dakuu75> why does she wear that helmet all the time?
[2:06:28] <$Ziegsy> what happens if you go full intimidate?
[2:06:40] <+D00msDayDan> yeah i just set squadmates to autolevel in ME1
[2:06:44] <+even_the_yuenglings> the combat in me3 is so much fun
[2:06:48] <BlueBiscuitGT> ME1 is the easiest one by far true
[2:06:48] <%DJFakie> Yeyeyeyeye
[2:06:48] <+FierceDeityGabe> Now that's the mako
[2:06:49] <$lotharrio> YEAH!
[2:06:51] <Shatterthought> @Dakuu75 Quarians have a very weak immune system
[2:06:54] <%Dakuu75> shreed that half-pipe bruh~
[2:06:57] <%GinAndRoses> eXtreme mako
[2:06:58] <+Alopekis> I really just focus on Decryption and Electronics. Everything after that I kind of just let the game auto-level for my squad.
[2:06:59] <satans_finest_millennial> Half pipe!
[2:07:02] <SaltyAzteca> Like a ballerina brick!
[2:07:02] <CrypticMochi> You still want the unlocking skills though
[2:07:08] <+athuramn> nailed it
[2:07:10] <%DJFakie> You also don't have to stay still while you repair the Mako
[2:07:11] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> aww yeah, ragdoll those geth
[2:07:12] <%Treuan> ... There's a forward boost?
[2:07:15] <%joodatious> ME3 combat wise is actually pretty fun mainly because of how they changed cooldowns and equipment. so much more fun turning yourself into a biotic supernuke with ultralight materials and just a locus smg
[2:07:15] <+even_the_yuenglings> BULLY THE COLLOSUS
[2:07:16] <RLT917> LUL
[2:07:19] <+yoshkosh20> I honestly wanna know what the interior of the mako looks like.
[2:07:19] <%Ranryu692> the removal of ME3's multiplayer dropped this from an instant buy to a "maybe someday" for me
[2:07:20] <%Varlinator> Love the extra boost they added - If only it was there in the OG
[2:07:24] <DensityD> SPLATTERED
[2:07:24] <+ThomasOfTroy> "It's so easy" - I can't wait for Pat to get to the rocket drone spam on the moon
[2:07:25] <+athuramn> the hero of the galaxy
[2:07:25] <%DJFakie> @Treuan Now there is!
[2:07:30] <BrOOnoh> nah man you need to level their decription and electronics to open containers and shit
[2:07:32] <Lamokmok> Wow, you can actually shoot shit near you now lol
[2:07:32] <%AncelDeLambert> alright, who let Pat drive? He doesn't have a license!
[2:07:33] <Deasmeister> Running the mako into armitures is the best
[2:07:34] <Samurai_Tchan> THERES A CANNISTER OUTSIDE
[2:07:35] <SomeAsianDood> You don't get reduced xp for killing people in the mako anymore right?
[2:07:37] <Archmortal> getting full XP inside the Mako is the fucking best
[2:07:38] <xcompleasedad> RIP in peace, ya filthy synthoids LUL
[2:07:46] <Samurai_Tchan> i think
[2:07:55] <%joodatious> @Ranryu692 seriously though not enough people know of the majesty that is ME3 multiplayer
[2:07:55] <+Alopekis> Is the music audio weird for anyone else?
[2:07:56] <Broken_Sonex> "You know those Red geth are kinda sus Shepard" - Tali
[2:07:58] <$lotharrio> Keep on RIPPing, space bots.
[2:08:08] <tanarath> best power ever
[2:08:12] <%joodatious> play as a korgan witha a hammer or a giant geth prime
[2:08:16] <+even_the_yuenglings> wait biotics work even if they have shields?
[2:08:17] <+yoshkosh20> @AncelDeLambert Pat's a spectre. He's above the law!
[2:08:19] <%DJFakie> Marksman used to be completely broken before LE
[2:08:22] <+brandonsbetow> Wait, are those boxes no longer exploadable?
[2:08:31] <dan_g_v> you're wild
[2:08:35] <%Dakuu75> "bitch i'm WILD"
[2:08:36] <+Alopekis> You're very wild
[2:08:37] <T_Sasquatch> Yes and yes
[2:08:37] <Archmortal> no, it's very bad at early levels
[2:08:38] <BlueBiscuitGT> Yes ye're wild Pat
[2:08:38] <+ThomasOfTroy> Nah it sucks
[2:08:38] <ape_hawk> yes, pat, you are playing an rpg
[2:08:39] <%JamesCorck> Nah, the early loot sucks.
[2:08:41] <%ScottishMadJacko> thats how it starts
[2:08:41] <%Varlinator> @PatStaresAt ABS - Always. Be. Saving.
[2:08:42] <%Treuan> Pat you wyllin, as the kids say
[2:08:42] <$lotharrio> I dunno, but your character's ass looks terrible.
[2:08:42] <%joodatious> you could play as  a biotic VOLUS in ME3 multiplayer for fucks sake
[2:08:43] <+robosqueeb> isnt this still pretty early game?
[2:08:45] <%SaiyanShoto> SaiyanShoto subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! Happy Birthday to the fattest and cutest boy! May he get all the treats he wants
[2:08:46] <%DJFakie> Yeah, there's some real winners and losers in the gear list
[2:08:47] <SomeAsianDood> yes
[2:08:48] <%IamGrapes> nah early gear in ME1 is always weak sauce
[2:08:48] <%Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 it was so much fun and opened my eyes to so many ability combinations that I hadn't thought of playing single player
[2:08:49] <%JamesCorck> also Pat, you are very wild.
[2:08:49] <Mattais88> Have yu even done anything outside the citadel yet/
[2:08:50] <%Order_of_Mystery> no, it will be terrible for a good long while. then you get the good shit
[2:08:53] <SaltyAzteca> Good to sell
[2:08:53] <heartlesshealer> gear kinda sucks early
[2:08:53] <Samurai_Tchan> THERES a chest outside
[2:08:53] <%JamesCorck> That's why we love you.
[2:08:54] <asurite_warrior> @PatStaresAt are you ready for plague number 2. The new bird flu?
[2:08:55] <xcompleasedad> Why tho
[2:08:55] <AmuserName> @PatStaresAt the starting pistol you get, the Stinger 2, is REALLY OP in the early game.
[2:08:55] <Virokwet> omni gel fodder
[2:08:56] <+Alopekis> It's pretty bad.
[2:08:58] <%DizzyGunner> nope, i ran the same pistol until the last mission
[2:08:58] <balthazar758> wild af
[2:09:00] <CrypticMochi> Early gear sucks ass
[2:09:01] <dan_g_v> so, why isn't Gief playing for his bday stream?
[2:09:01] <tanarath> @patstaresat it's aweful tier 4. also, losing your mind
[2:09:01] <%twistedj3ster> Who killed Pat?
[2:09:05] <%DJFakie> Some manufacturers just give you straight up garbo stuff
[2:09:07] <T_Sasquatch> Loot in this game sucks in general
[2:09:08] <+yoshkosh20> good shit don't come til later
[2:09:12] <%IamGrapes> thats why every NG+ you automatically have access to Spectre gear which is amazing
[2:09:14] <+ThomasOfTroy> How's the FOV for you Pat?
[2:09:20] <Mattais88> Shotgun dat ass
[2:09:23] <%twistedj3ster> how embaressing for his butt
[2:09:24] <%joodatious> I still hate ME1's armor so much its so ugly.  do you guys like muddy muted colors!??
[2:09:28] <+Alopekis> It's like it doesn't account for the fact that you aren't at the very beginning anymore, so it just gives you a ton of started gear.
[2:09:29] <+yoshkosh20> that made me laugh harder than it should've
[2:09:31] <dan_g_v> so, the girl with the helmet already told us these guys are super evil?
[2:09:33] <%Dakuu75> Pat looks like he's having way more fun than Simmons
[2:09:41] <+even_the_yuenglings> ME1 armor sucks
[2:09:47] <+athuramn> part of the reason I never enjoyed the shotgun was because the pistol is way stronger than it should be xx
[2:09:48] <%DJFakie> They stop giving you armor piercing drops at gear level 7 so save some, it's 40%
[2:09:57] <Archmortal> The pistol you can get off Eden Prime is the only weapon you're really likely to get from a non-shit manufacturer
[2:09:57] <%ScottishMadJacko> yeah, it's his first time
[2:09:59] <%Dakuu75> He did, he beat ME 1
[2:10:01] <CrypticMochi> I don’t think you get decent stuff until the  2nd planet
[2:10:01] <%Kitafin> yes he is
[2:10:03] <DracaenaLeaf> Simmons rushed through it
[2:10:04] <%logoth_> Whenever Pat is enjoying himself, Elmo comes to get comfy
[2:10:05] <morningmoondude> Simmons only likes anime RPGs, but he hates anime.
[2:10:05] <%doomunderthestairs> yeah Simmons first time
[2:10:12] <dan_g_v> first time in 10 years?
[2:10:15] <mr_mister0> shit run
[2:10:20] <Radioactive_Jam > oh boy
[2:10:21] <ioci2112> shepard is a elite alliance commando and specter, but he can only run for 10 meters before getting tired
[2:10:22] <BlueBiscuitGT> YEYEYE
[2:10:23] <dan_g_v> wait, 100 percento?!
[2:10:29] <Blank9> yeahhhh
[2:10:30] <+robosqueeb> doubt Kappa
[2:10:31] <+HelloImTom08> the perfect playthough
[2:10:31] <%JamesCorck> OMG yes! So good to hear you say that!
[2:10:33] <$lotharrio> FULL PLAYTHROUGH CONFIRMED
[2:10:34] <Ipsenscastle> playing ME1 without being able to throw your mind back in time must be difficult
[2:10:34] <%DianaTheAscian> is that hard?
[2:10:34] <ape_hawk> pat, that means keeping miranda alive
[2:10:35] <Mattais88> Dosen't that take every romances and class?
[2:10:36] <+even_the_yuenglings> RUN IT OVER
[2:10:37] <ape_hawk> MIRANDA
[2:10:38] <%JamesCorck> 1005 Baby letsgo!!
[2:10:39] <RetributionP> x to doubt
[2:10:39] <+FelIian> ME2 100% is long with the probes
[2:10:40] <+Alopekis> I've beaten ME1 3 times already. About to completely a 100% then move on the ME2. Having a ton of fun, even playing it over and over. lol
[2:10:42] <%DJFakie> Including all the planet surveys? Check the wiki, friend!
[2:10:43] <dd44dostivei> 170 hour playthrough
[2:10:45] <%joodatious> they where smart in turning the ME1 armor into the games actual under armor it was a smart move you can see alot of where the old armor is in ME2 and 3
[2:10:52] <+mixmastermoody> Even achievements? This game is rough
[2:10:54] <%shadowsofpain> No the Giraffe robot!
[2:10:54] <%JamesCorck> 100% XD thank you keyboard.
[2:10:55] <%Order_of_Mystery> THWOMP THE COLLOSSUS
[2:10:55] <%IamGrapes> always have omnigel to repair the Mako
[2:10:56] <+even_the_yuenglings> LUL
[2:10:56] <%YakumoYomi> psaWink psaWink psaWink
[2:11:03] <Rei_Dsoto> Going for the MadLad playthrough eh?
[2:11:03] <Deasmeister> Uncharted worlds are ROUGH if you do them back to back I find
[2:11:07] <Teras_ode> stun and gun
[2:11:09] <dan_g_v> why is Pat killing the space giraffes?
[2:11:19] <+yoshkosh20> @Javi9563 it's all the thresher maw acid he breathed in at akuze.
[2:11:25] <BlueBiscuitGT> Same, ME1 was a Christmas gift from a friend who literally, out of nowhere, rang up my apartment the week before x-mas, shoved this game in my hand and said "You gotta play this"
[2:11:25] <Ipsenscastle> it surprised me how fast ME1 was to 100%, compared with my memory
[2:11:34] <%RonaldMcDownload> The giraffes know what they did.
[2:11:38] <CrypticMochi> Oh, does that glitch to get the mako through those rocks still work?
[2:11:41] <SilverFaustX> nintendo is opening a art gallery in japan
[2:11:43] <+even_the_yuenglings> YOU CAN LOCK ON?
[2:11:43] <Samurai_Tchan> this species are the CONNECTOIDS
[2:11:43] <%dekkitout> Do the robo zebras have their own hopes, dreams and ambitions too, to is that a bipedal geth only feature?
[2:11:44] <%DJFakie> What sucks about 100% on stream is you can't listen to a podcast while you're streaming
[2:11:46] <auraofdawn> could you zoom in like that in OG?
[2:11:46] <%shadowsofpain> Pat those robot giraffes are endangered how could you
[2:11:49] <%joodatious> you think the geth would just bombard the mako with the ship. they have orbital bombardments after all
[2:11:51] <Teras_ode> wee goes the geth
[2:11:53] <RedPlasticCup> uh oh
[2:11:55] <Mattais88> Remember in ME2, where these things become an actual threatening enemy?
[2:12:05] <Samurai_Tchan> WOW
[2:12:07] <SaltyAzteca> Colossus, more like dead
[2:12:12] <SomeAsianDood> what a ragdoll
[2:12:12] <Lamokmok> Colossus delayed death
[2:12:13] <dan_g_v> dang, I had forgotten they are called Geth
[2:12:14] <xcompleasedad> God, the Mako is the best vehicle in the universe LUL
[2:12:15] <Ipsenscastle> blowing up geth infantry with the Mako cannon is always so satisfying
[2:12:19] <%RonaldMcDownload> Boo
[2:12:23] <%DJFakie> @Mattais88 There's a slightly tough fight at the end of this on high difficulties
[2:12:25] <+athuramn> nailed it @saltyazteca
[2:12:30] <xcompleasedad> Like, imagine a tank battalion of MAKOS
[2:12:31] <+Alopekis> At what point am I supposed to unlock Spectre gear? I've maxed out my money and I'm level 26 but it still isn't showing.
[2:12:34] <+samiscoolbro> I feel like they made the mako more durable in this version I barely used Omni gel when I played through LE
[2:12:40] <+FierceDeityGabe> That's a jjabrams
[2:12:41] <%twistedj3ster> do sick burnouts on its corpse
[2:12:41] <seancbo> @Mattais88 Theyre pretty threatening in this when you have to fight on foot
[2:12:42] <dan_g_v> ... is there music, or Pat muted it?
[2:12:46] <%DJFakie> @Alopekis It's a bug
[2:12:47] <SaltyAzteca> @athuramn Kappa b
[2:12:49] <+yoshkosh20> do some donuts on that geth's corpse. tali would love that.
[2:12:50] <Teras_ode> very 2007
[2:12:51] <Samurai_Tchan> MASS effect willl return
[2:12:52] <+tamoose_aruse> I'm still trying to figure out how to play this game and not romance garrus
[2:12:52] <dero45> best fukn skyboxes
[2:12:58] <dan_g_v> oh, there IS
[2:13:02] <%joodatious> I always wished we could of drove the Tonka trucks in ME2 they are YUGE
[2:13:03] <Deasmeister> @Mattais88 They become thretening in five minutes without your tank
[2:13:03] <CrypticMochi> @samiscoolbro It has faster shield regen
[2:13:13] <+Alopekis> @DJFakie Aw, that sucks. I saw it at the very beginning of the game but I didn't have money to get it. So am I locked out completely?
[2:13:16] <Samurai_Tchan> I wish we had a Mass Efect tv series on netflix
[2:13:19] <Lamokmok> It's no Nomad, but the Nomad is in a shitier game.
[2:13:19] <+even_the_yuenglings> the audio mixing is odd in this game
[2:13:19] <%shadowsofpain> I miss ME3's multiplayer the N7 sentinel and the krogan warlord where so much fun to play
[2:13:21] <%Dakuu75> music in this game is a VERY Ratchet & Clank sounding. I dig it.
[2:13:24] <%TacosGrande> psaGib
[2:13:25] <ShudMirelurk> HahaCat
[2:13:26] <%GinAndRoses> psaGib
[2:13:26] <SaltyAzteca> Elmo nooo
[2:13:28] <stantheman_97> baby grandpa
[2:13:29] <dan_g_v> I was wondering, this looked like the usual badass vehicle segment with the badass music
[2:13:30] <%Order_of_Mystery> elmo is getting banned
[2:13:32] <ioci2112> @Alopekis there's a bug in the LE, the vendor loses it forever, there's a workaround but you gotta reload a save BEFORE you become a specter
[2:13:35] <SomeAsianDood> @tamoose_aruse just accept your fate. It's inevitable to romance the space birb
[2:13:37] <%shadowsofpain> plus playing a volus biotic was hilarious
[2:13:37] <%Ranryu692> stop leaving cans in Elmo's path
[2:13:39] <%DJFakie> "Elmo NO" supercut
[2:13:41] <Samurai_Tchan> I want a Mass Effect Netflix show
[2:13:42] <%Varlinator> cheer500 Hey Pat, Great Stream! - Got a couple of Fun Nilus Facts for you: 1) You can have Garrus wear his armour (Phantom by Serrice) 2) His voice actor is the same guy who voiced Armstrong in Metal Gear Rising. ANCIENT MACHINES, Son!
[2:13:43] <+even_the_yuenglings> me3 multiplayer was the shit. adept volus FTW
[2:13:55] <BlueBiscuitGT> I wonder if they where making a point when they made every single non-human companion in ME1 better than the human ones
[2:14:04] <+Alopekis> @Javi9563 Oh, well I can't do that. lol Oh well. Sucks, but I've still got some good gear right now.
[2:14:08] <Samurai_Tchan> @even_the_yuenglings theres volus ? you kiidding me
[2:14:09] <%Dakuu75> YEET~!

[2:14:14] <SaltyAzteca> Dayum Geth went flyin
[2:14:14] <+ryuguitarfreak> Yeah. The Nomad was good, but it didn't have the fun weapons and was on a way worse game
[2:14:17] <%weissguard> Launched, by god. LUL
[2:14:22] <%DJFakie> You only have to have companions for five missions for the achievement instead of "majority of the game"
[2:14:26] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Can get past that bit
[2:14:30] <%Ranryu692> no you don't
[2:14:33] <%joodatious> the N7 sentinel is so cool its a crime they never gave Shepard alot of those awesome abilities
[2:14:34] <Samurai_Tchan> batarians are the ugliests
[2:14:34] <+Alopekis> I don't remember there being Volus characters in ME3 multiplayer.
[2:14:38] <BlueBiscuitGT> LUL Wrex was posing
[2:14:39] <morningmoondude> i wish you could dick wrex
[2:14:42] <%SaiyanShoto> Only one is drowning and you have to choose one
[2:14:44] <%JamesCorck> you can glitch through here tho.
[2:14:44] <+samiscoolbro> @alopekis spectre guns are good but you still be op by endgame
[2:14:46] <%sporeian94> GET PAT DRIVE THAT MAKO THROUGH THE CRACK RIGHT NOW
[2:14:46] <T_Sasquatch> @bluebiscuitgt i think its more of the fact that Ashely or kaiden can die so they didn't put much effort into them
[2:14:47] <thebalticguy1> ME 1's checkpoints are TRASH
[2:14:47] <%joodatious> running up to dudes and shield bashing or slashing with your sword is so cool
[2:14:48] <Samurai_Tchan> I WANT VOLUS shootout
[2:14:49] <tanarath> Tali is spacist, it's ok pat.
[2:14:50] <%Order_of_Mystery> @PatStaresAt who you romancing in this series?
[2:14:50] <%Varlinator> ALWAYS. BE. SAVING.
[2:14:51] <%DJFakie> Yeah, there's a couple extra saves in LE
[2:14:54] <PunishedVenomWolf> who's pat planing to romance?
[2:14:54] <+yoshkosh20> gotta slip wrex 5 bucks to let him know he's the favorite.
[2:14:54] <%SaiyanShoto> Wait I fucked that sentence up
[2:14:55] <+athuramn> Sheppard is making very liberal use of his spectre authority
[2:14:55] <+JaseAdrift> Tali and Wrex...good team
[2:14:55] <%DJFakie> They know the rough parts
[2:14:56] <Samurai_Tchan> i mean
[2:14:56] <dd44dostivei> human silohuette shaped rocks
[2:14:56] <+ryuguitarfreak> There was a volus
[2:14:59] <brexdq> crazy talk
[2:15:00] <AmuserName> SourPls
[2:15:03] <s1rcuit> @SaiyanShoto LUL
[2:15:04] <+ryuguitarfreak> There was geth too
[2:15:04] <Teras_ode> SourPls
[2:15:05] <BlueBiscuitGT> @T_Sasquatch Fair, but still
[2:15:07] <Samurai_Tchan> I WANT A HANNAR fps
[2:15:07] <%Varlinator> catJam
[2:15:10] <%joodatious> @BlueBiscuitGT it was later in the games life cycle, they had ALOT of free DLC packs
[2:15:13] <%DJFakie> Keep that keyboard nearby and you get quick saves!
[2:15:18] <balthazar758> Jebaited
[2:15:23] <+even_the_yuenglings> volus in me3 multiplayer was fuckin sick
[2:15:26] <%joodatious> you could play as a collector or geth and even Vorcha
[2:15:31] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh damn, nobody told me the Geth had thighs for days O_O
[2:15:35] <%DJFakie> F5!
[2:15:37] <Aleate> @samurai_tchan Blasto FPS when
[2:15:39] <aiutare47> @Samurai_Tchan There are collectors, drell, volus, even turian cabal, which are iirc just a lore thing
[2:15:42] <%dekkitout> Lemme guess, quicksave is f5
[2:15:42] <%DJFakie> Or one of those F keys.
[2:15:43] <%king_wragles> So the guns just seem faster and more effective than the space magic
[2:15:45] <%shadowsofpain> a lot of my love for Sentinel was due to the N7 one. I loved shield bashing geth
[2:15:53] <auraofdawn> oh man i should be playing my vanguard like this lol
[2:15:54] <+ryuguitarfreak> There was like a year or two of support for ME3 mp
[2:15:54] <+JaseAdrift> Please dear god pat remember that button
[2:15:55] <+Alopekis> If I do Virmire before saving Liara, will it still boot me back to the Citadel and then lock me out? Or do I have to do all 4 of the main missions before it does that?
[2:15:57] <%DJFakie> YB!
[2:15:57] <SomeAsianDood> They were modeled after quarians. The best parts had to transfer @CappuccinoGuil
[2:15:58] <tanarath> Geth are literally quarians but not spacist
[2:16:04] <ioci2112> @Alopekis it also works if you do it with another playthrough, some dude uploaded a save in nexus mods and you can use that I think
[2:16:07] <PunishedVenomWolf> I do hope they somehow bring back me3 co op id like to try it
[2:16:08] <+ryuguitarfreak> They added A LOT
[2:16:17] <aiutare47> @shadowsofpain the vanguard n7 with the sword was sick as hell
[2:16:21] <thebalticguy1> REMEMBER SNIPER SWAY
[2:16:21] <$renegade_blade> I liked the infiltrator from me3 multiplayer with the sword
[2:16:23] <CappuccinoGuil> @SomeAsianDood Daaaamn, they did a good job on that for sure
[2:16:24] <$lotharrio> Tali just face tanking and doing fine.
[2:16:25] <%Cykron> Sniping is like legit now
[2:16:26] <Samurai_Tchan> @aiutare47 hmmm wishh there has hannar
[2:16:28] <%joodatious> the Quarian commandos where also really fun
[2:16:28] <Dabrikishaw> You need to get iLiara Apoekis
[2:16:36] <%DJFakie> The pistol is really good in this game TBH
[2:16:37] <+yoshkosh20> man she has a giant butt.
[2:16:39] <thebalticguy1> It used to sway pat
[2:16:41] <s1rcuit> why would geth have medi gel?
[2:16:44] <%DJFakie> Marksman used to be broken
[2:16:44] <%dekkitout> Shotguns and snipers, the absolute ends of the spectrum
[2:16:51] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt who you gonna romance?
[2:16:54] <thebalticguy1> Spectre training for moral poitns boost
[2:16:56] <BlueBiscuitGT> Combined with biotics, nothing, although Pistols are very good in ME1
[2:16:56] <+D00msDayDan> armor these nuts
[2:16:59] <CappuccinoGuil> Can you max out all skills in this?
[2:17:03] <%Order_of_Mystery> shotty sniper playstyle, i respect it
[2:17:04] <tanarath> @thebalticguy1 so good that they removed it
[2:17:04] <Dabrikishaw> @Alopekis You need to complete all 4 worlds before that
[2:17:06] <+FierceDeityGabe> Garrus
[2:17:14] <+Alopekis> Alright, cool. Cause I want to do Virmire first cause I've never done it before saving her but I didn't want to get locked out from the Citadel yet. Thanks! lol
[2:17:14] <%shadowsofpain> @aiutare47 The entire N7 character where incredible I don't think there was a bad one among the
[2:17:18] <%twistedj3ster> I like how Tali has the toggle helmet prompt
[2:17:20] <%shadowsofpain> them
[2:17:21] <yourliteraldog> sup homiea
[2:17:22] <%bread_assassin> Ash -> Tali -> Tali
[2:17:23] <%DJFakie> @CappuccinoGuil No, in later levels you get 2 skill points
[2:17:25] <%dekkitout> Ha
[2:17:25] <%Dakuu75> lol
[2:17:28] <+even_the_yuenglings> nice
[2:17:30] <%whyskeywolfe> "A Poly Thing"
[2:17:31] <%cvp5127> coward
[2:17:33] <%afronooch> LUL
[2:17:34] <+FierceDeityGabe> Win
[2:17:35] <dan_g_v> so, we know what the plan is now
[2:17:35] <BlueBiscuitGT> Truly aliens do it better
[2:17:36] <SaltyAzteca> WEAK
[2:17:36] <%Order_of_Mystery> Ash is WEAK
[2:17:36] <iosephe> may be worth it just for that
[2:17:37] <+MightyDuckShoes> Liara is a fucking doormat
[2:17:37] <SlippedDisco> what a party pooper
[2:17:37] <Lamokmok> You could chose no one lol
[2:17:37] <Broken_Sonex> AND LIAR IS LIKE OKAY SURE
[2:17:37] <%Varlinator> Yep LUL
[2:17:38] <SomeAsianDood> Ashley hates it but liara's down to clown of course
[2:17:38] <morningmoondude> he can fuck Racist, Purple Racist Lil Sister, Mommy who's just a tad racist
[2:17:38] <8th_nel> do it
[2:17:38] <+Gespens> Ashley is not only a racist, but a COWARD
[2:17:38] <%Dakuu75> VERY nice
[2:17:39] <%NateyBeak> booo ashley get with the times
[2:17:39] <tanarath> Liara is legit chill
[2:17:40] <$xXRealGamerThaigeXx> thats fucking hilarious
[2:17:40] <SaltyAzteca> SHE'S A WEAK CHGOPPA
[2:17:41] <$lotharrio> It would explain some things that happened to me in ME2.
[2:17:42] <%DizzyGunner> but that means tryna bang a space racist in the first place
[2:17:42] <%GarbageNirvana> Ah, so Ashley is Woolie
[2:17:43] <dero45> more reasons to hate ash
[2:17:43] <softbirby> Liara is the superior choice
[2:17:44] <%joodatious> I cucked ashley as well its great
[2:17:44] <BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt LIARA IS CANON!
[2:17:46] <heartlesshealer> Yeah Ashley hates it
[2:17:46] <%Puhff> Liara best girl
[2:17:47] <T_Sasquatch> This game series refuses to let you have multiple romances
[2:17:49] <%afronooch> just furthering Liara supremacy
[2:17:49] <AngryAsian5> So obviously Liara is the best waifu
[2:17:49] <+JaseAdrift> HUGE COWARD
[2:17:49] <MarvelousMrD> tali just to see the new night stand photo
[2:17:50] <+D00msDayDan> that's the option i tried to choose in my first playthrough
[2:17:50] <+even_the_yuenglings> cant believe you cant romance tali in ME1
[2:17:50] <SlippedDisco> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[2:17:51] <%Order_of_Mystery> although Liara isn't into Poly in later games, she gets pissed
[2:17:52] <$RealThiele> her racism beats her horny
[2:17:52] <Dabrikishaw> For Female Shepard I like to got Kaiden > Thane > Kaiden
[2:17:53] <xcompleasedad> She is not a fan of da pussi
[2:17:54] <CappuccinoGuil> What about Tali and Ashley? Feel like they'd have a lot in common Kappa
[2:17:54] <s1rcuit> @Gespens same thing
[2:17:54] <Dunmarkh> romance ashley just to cuck her
[2:18:00] <Broken_Sonex> LIARA IS SO OKAY WITH IT
[2:18:01] <SlippedDisco> splat
[2:18:02] <morningmoondude> Liara gets HUGE MOMMY MILKERS in 3
[2:18:02] <%dekkitout> Wow...
[2:18:03] <heartlesshealer> could go chaste first game and then Jack later
[2:18:04] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Do that and then blow Ashley up woolieFABRICATION
[2:18:05] <$xXRealGamerThaigeXx> my favorite romance is tali just for the flirting in the geth drednaught mission in 3
[2:18:06] <%Cykron> I saved my body for my pure trad Tali relationship in ME2
[2:18:07] <%DJFakie> Since you did Tali before, maybe Liara > Liara > Liara psaSmug
[2:18:12] <dero45> melted
[2:18:14] <%Robot_Nixon_> That's because Ashley is Trashley :)
[2:18:16] <tanarath> Ashley wants to be a tradwife
[2:18:16] <BeezusHrist> Liara is Canon boo
[2:18:18] <yourliteraldog> When did shepherd become a hockey dad
[2:18:19] <CrypticMochi> Apparently all enemies now take proper headshot damage, probably one of the reasons for the pistol marksman nerf. Also some pistols seem to have different rates of fire.
[2:18:20] <+even_the_yuenglings> liara is best girl anyways
[2:18:20] <QuestlordJake> God I love the sound of the sniper rifles
[2:18:22] <+HelloImTom08> asari are so open minded yea know
[2:18:23] <hat_under_bread> That's a satisfying particle effect.
[2:18:24] <+yoshkosh20> Pat HATES jack
[2:18:30] <%Dakuu75> That has to be the MOST unexpected-response when you catch your significant other, in the middle of the cheat. "Mind if I join you?"
[2:18:31] <%Wallabri> Ahhh Liara, the only Asari with regular human eyebrows
[2:18:32] <Samurai_Tchan> man LIARA IS A GOD in this game, she lifts people like magneto
[2:18:34] <heartlesshealer> ah
[2:18:34] <+RealMichaelPhelps> hardest boss in the game
[2:18:35] <+JaseAdrift> This is a Tali Household
[2:18:37] <+even_the_yuenglings> this fight monkaS
[2:18:39] <%barkon345> wow he gets a phase lock ability in this game?
[2:18:39] <SlippedDisco> ohhh noooo
[2:18:41] <aiutare47> this FIGHT
[2:18:43] <%DizzyGunner> qucik saves is what makes RPGs so much better on pc
[2:18:43] <dero45> lucky pc bastards and ya quicksaves
[2:18:44] <aiutare47> FUCKED ME UP
[2:18:44] <heartlesshealer> then iunno blue ladies
[2:18:48] <%IamGrapes> Tali is okay
[2:18:48] <%DJFakie> I think they autosave here in LE cause they know
[2:18:49] <+ryuguitarfreak> I can't wait
[2:18:51] <%Varlinator> FROGGERS
[2:18:52] <SaltyAzteca> I HATE THESE THINGS
[2:18:55] <%joodatious> Liara romance throughout the trilogy is arguably the best choice and has the best standing as being the canon choice honestly
[2:18:56] <%weissguard> Spider Geth, Spider Geth.
[2:18:56] <%IamGrapes> not as good as Garrus or Wrex
[2:18:56] <+even_the_yuenglings> this fight on insane NotLikeThis
[2:19:00] <%Dakuu75> was that a space-doggo?
[2:19:00] <$lotharrio> Ceiling Geth was watching you masturbate.
[2:19:01] <$RealThiele> spoderman
[2:19:01] <s1rcuit> that seemed pointless
[2:19:03] <%Piemen99> long boy
[2:19:04] <yourliteraldog> geth
[2:19:05] <hat_under_bread> Look at that 2007 animation.
[2:19:05] <RetributionP> a licker?!
[2:19:09] <%GinAndRoses> that's a big boy
[2:19:10] <SomeAsianDood> oh god
[2:19:11] <%shadowsofpain> The more I talk about the Multiplayer the more I remember how underrated it actually was
[2:19:12] <$hattrick61> imagine not forcing the mako through the gap
[2:19:12] <+ryuguitarfreak> I can’t wait for Matriarch Liara in the new game
[2:19:12] <yourliteraldog> Geth are so fucking rad
[2:19:13] <Lamokmok> I couldn't romance Liara because she sounds like Lightning and Lightning sucks
[2:19:15] <%Cykron> Tali is MAH WIFE
[2:19:16] <%Treuan> This is the wall for me
[2:19:16] <+D00msDayDan> wrex looks so awkward holding human guns
[2:19:21] <dero45> no fight is harder than 2 krogans on insanity
[2:19:22] <+MightyDuckShoes> Every romance option in ME1 was trash. I ended up assaulted by Liara simply because I wasn't enough of a dick about refusing the blue pussy. Bioware took my Shepard by force.
[2:19:23] <T_Sasquatch> Og me1 on normal is so brutal
[2:19:26] <%barristerofthebar> I remember this death trap
[2:19:35] <%DJFakie> The geth overheat your guns
[2:19:36] <+samiscoolbro> This scene with the mako is hilarious
[2:19:40] <$lotharrio> You got EMP'd or something.
[2:19:41] <Samurai_Tchan> the SHIELDRILIONS
[2:19:41] <Dabrikishaw> @Samurai_Tchan Biotcs never get stronger than the first game because of the low cooldowns on all their crowd control powers, yeah
[2:19:43] <pth88> you got hit by dampening
[2:19:44] <BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt Who retrieves your body from the shadowbroker and gives it to Cerberus? Who would go through the danger of doing that and why? That's why she's canon
[2:19:50] <thebalticguy1> Power specific COOLDOWNS
[2:19:51] <+even_the_yuenglings> it feels like they nerfed insane in the legendary edition
[2:19:51] <%Varlinator> you got damped
[2:19:52] <xbb1024> why are your shits fucked?
[2:19:58] <heartlesshealer> wish there were a gay/bi option besides Kaiden. Humans are boring in this setting
[2:20:01] <Draco_Renegade> I always used the Mako for this fight
[2:20:01] <SaltyAzteca> WREX BibleThump
[2:20:04] <yourliteraldog> what class is pat playing
[2:20:06] <heartlesshealer> (I have not played 3)
[2:20:10] <+WeLucklessJacks> What class is he?
[2:20:12] <hat_under_bread> Just slap his shit
[2:20:12] <Samurai_Tchan> @Samurai_Tchan hummmm
[2:20:13] <thebalticguy1> WREX IS DEAD
[2:20:14] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Wait is the stalker that flying thing in ME3 the reapers have?
[2:20:17] <%joodatious> biotic combos are very fun and satisfying.
[2:20:18] <%DJFakie> @yourliteraldog Vanguard, by popular vote
[2:20:18] <Dunmarkh> @yourliteraldog vanguard
[2:20:19] <+PenmanLupine> got hacked or something
[2:20:21] <+yoshkosh20> Wrex died. tali is clearly the superior squadmate.
[2:20:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> I could never aim the sniper, so I grinded the achievement by modding it into a hitscan rocket that knocks dudes 100 ft in the air.
[2:20:24] <$RealThiele> LUL
[2:20:27] <Lamokmok> Bye Wrex, didn't need to get shot by Ash for that one
[2:20:28] <%sporeian94> this oss fight sucks as
[2:20:28] <%twistedj3ster> he was on roller skates
[2:20:29] <%sporeian94> ass
[2:20:30] <+FierceDeityGabe> Pat went to the woolie school of shooting the stomach
[2:20:33] <+athuramn> shotgun would be wildly more effective at this range
[2:20:35] <%Dakuu75> Man, I can never tell if enemies get hit because they have zero-flinch

[2:21:16] <heartlesshealer> THAT SPIN
[2:21:16] <%joodatious> the lack of flinch in ME games is probably its biggest issue in the series.

[2:21:25] <+MightyDuckShoes> @heartlesshealer  Yeah, all the gay is in 3, sadly. Even Kaiden actually. He's fully straight in ME1. They just retconned him after because... kind of a dickmove to have the only lesbian option be a "nonfemale" alien.

[2:22:14] <+even_the_yuenglings> its a fucking tank
[2:22:16] <thebalticguy1> Its too strong
[2:22:17] <%Rumbutt> your barrier was already gone
[2:22:18] <iosephe> big damage
[2:22:18] <$lotharrio> Hit too hard I guess.
[2:22:19] <%Eilocke> because it's a tank
[2:22:20] <satans_finest_millennial> it ate the barrier
[2:22:20] <%twistedj3ster> because your barrier is smelly
[2:22:21] <+ThomasOfTroy> Because you tried to face fuck a boss
[2:22:22] <%Puhff> Shoulda popped TBN
[2:22:23] <dashmatt> Tali noooooo
[2:22:26] <heartlesshealer> @MightyDuckShoes Damn. At least it's there in the end, but damn.
[2:22:26] <Sigma_190_Beta> It broke your barrier.
[2:22:28] <korolev787> I’d just stay back and snipe it.
[2:22:28] <s1rcuit> @ghostfaceninja_ don't you mean get WREKT?

[2:22:31] <%shadowace2400> !uptime
[2:22:31] <@Moobot> @shadowace2400 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 22m.
[2:22:32] <ShudMirelurk> What barrier ? lol
[2:22:32] <Broken_Sonex> Man it was so crazy how okay Liara was with having a threeway. Asari are very openminded I guess.
[2:22:33] <%ScottishMadJacko> some attacks do, but I also think it destroyed your barrier and health in ond
[2:22:33] <%joodatious> bashees in ME3 still scare me.
[2:22:33] <%Ranryu692> because fuck you
[2:22:36] <%sporeian94> Tali is dead fyi
[2:22:36] <%barristerofthebar> Don't face tank a literal tank?
[2:22:37] <tanarath> @patstaresat it tank, tank kill person
[2:22:37] <Samurai_Tchan> I managed to get the mako HERE one day and i used its weapon to deal with these guys
[2:22:45] <Psyramics> you put a bunch of points in barrier and that shit makes you invincible
[2:22:46] <%DJFakie> Health regen armor slotting is important in this game
[2:22:47] <Deasmeister> Barrier takes 700 damage and goes
[2:22:49] <+alphonseisbest> Shoulda popped TBN
[2:22:52] <+PenmanLupine> you had no barrier
[2:22:54] <+even_the_yuenglings> man shields aint shit in this difficulty
[2:23:01] <mikesumusprime> no joke, this part took me like 5 tries to beat :(
[2:23:03] <%Eilocke> i honestly forgot this game had a cover system
[2:23:06] <%SvenHolgersson> DID I MISS ASHLEY BEING RACIST
[2:23:09] <aiutare47> Holy shit snipers are extremely good in LE. literally no drawbacks here
[2:23:11] <+brandonsbetow> it does more dmg then your barrier
[2:23:17] <%barristerofthebar> @SvenHolgersson Never
[2:23:20] <+brandonsbetow> meaning barrier doesnt block
[2:23:20] <xcompleasedad> Tali is unconscious
[2:23:21] <+samiscoolbro> What is this hardcore?
[2:23:23] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> What class did Pat end up choosing?
[2:23:23] <SomeAsianDood> No we're still in ME1
[2:23:29] <Sigma_190_Beta> @SvenHolgersson Not yet.
[2:23:32] <%IamGrapes> Fun Fact: The song that played when you die is called Saren. It's funny to think that when you die, his theme is playing and he just laughs at your failure
[2:23:39] <+FelIian> Vanguard iir
[2:23:45] <dero45> lol
[2:23:45] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL

[2:23:50] <+athuramn> half gang
[2:23:51] <%joodatious> man the basic roll in ME3 was such a good edition even with the wonky cover system. nothing feels more stiff then shepard running to cover still
[2:23:51] <+even_the_yuenglings> wheres tali?
[2:23:52] <%DJFakie> Your throw is too weak, it gets more force with more levels
[2:23:52] <%Spydurman> ITS A TANK
[2:23:52] <+JaseAdrift> LUL yeah throw the big robot
[2:23:53] <Lamokmok> Jeez, you don't even need to specialize in snipers to use it decently.
[2:23:54] <Sigma_190_Beta> It's a tank.
[2:23:59] <Broken_Sonex> @IamGrapes THAT'S funny
[2:24:00] <xcompleasedad> You NEED to rez Tali
[2:24:01] <dashmatt> Sniper the face
[2:24:05] <dero45> fire everything
[2:24:05] <+JaseAdrift> Tali is down
[2:24:10] <8th_nel> if only you had tali
[2:24:11] <%templar010> @PatStaresAt Tali
[2:24:12] <Sigma_190_Beta> You need to bring the shield down.
[2:24:12] <%Puhff> Grenaaade

[2:24:14] <%Cykron> TALI NEEDS GELL BADLY
[2:24:16] <heartlesshealer> guys, plural
[2:24:19] <%Ranryu692> why don't YOU just shoot it?
[2:24:20] <%AncelDeLambert> and this is why you need electric attacks
[2:24:21] <RedPlasticCup> gun
[2:24:25] <%Eilocke> if you did any less damage you'd be healing it
[2:24:27] <+FelIian> this is why Stasis is broken late game as a Sentinel
[2:24:30] <%IamGrapes> use grenades
[2:24:31] <%sporeian94> He doesn't have unity he can't revive
[2:24:31] <%joodatious> the armature has cute animations. look at those adorable feets
[2:24:34] <Dabrikishaw> Man, according to all the dev commentary over the years, Miranda, Jacob, Tali, Thane, and Jack were all meant to be bisexual or pansexual. Would it have really been so hard to put that all back into the remaster?
[2:24:35] <tanarath> LITERAL TANK
[2:24:35] <%ScottishMadJacko> shame tali is down
[2:24:35] <ioci2112> snipers wobbled like crazy in ME1, they are just perfectly accurate in LE, it's insane

[2:25:27] <logothete2401> Geth use phasic rounds, which penetrate barriers

[2:25:31] <+MightyDuckShoes> God that gameover theme is my nightmares
[2:25:32] <Deasmeister> Barrier has 700 hp base
[2:25:33] <+Totally_Not_Toby> i think it does more damage tahn your barrier can protect from at this point
[2:25:35] <%ScottishMadJacko> it's basically an extra layer of shield
[2:25:35] <korolev787> Don’t get hit by the big ball of energy

[2:27:05] <AngryAsian5> I think this section is the reason why I do Feros first to get level ups.
[2:27:05] <Lamokmok> I though you could position the party in LE?
[2:27:05] <+Totally_Not_Toby> they have an ability that overheats your gun

[2:27:10] <adustconstant> This is possibly the second hardest fight in the game
[2:27:11] <%justcallmebobplease> Tali dying is causally required to be step 1 of a reload
[2:27:12] <heartlesshealer> I wonder what status effects are
[2:27:12] <+ThomasOfTroy> Honestly, just drop the difficulty, there's no reason not to
[2:27:12] <%Ranryu692> Tali get behind cover LUL
[2:27:13] <Archmortal> might I humbly suggest ordering your companions to seek cover instead of following you into the line of fire
[2:27:17] <+robosqueeb> Can you tell your teammates to specifically target enemies or was that in ME2?
[2:27:19] <%Rumbutt> he's getting worse every time oroLUL

[2:27:22] <%JamesCorck> Yeah, this area of the game is real tough really early on.
[2:27:24] <%DJFakie> Adrenaline just resets power cooldowns
[2:27:24] <%Varlinator> This is going well Kappa
[2:27:26] <+ghostfaceninja_> so does this tank enemy move around in later fights or?
[2:27:29] <srv4254> the final boss is unbearable because of the way he moves
[2:27:30] <%Cykron> It's called poison
[2:27:30] <%ScottishMadJacko> poison
[2:27:31] <+even_the_yuenglings> radioactive rounds

[2:31:30] <%afronooch> its hard if do Liara first

[2:31:36] <dd44dostivei> thorian might be woorse
[2:31:37] <%sporeian94> Yeah it's probably the hardest next to the korgan coming up
[2:31:41] <%Varlinator> Top 3 hardest yeah
[2:31:42] <SlippedDisco> hm.
[2:31:42] <AmuserName> MAYBE Thorian is harder, but not much
[2:31:43] <+athuramn> LMAO what a great moment to see tali just staring off with her scope in the sky

[2:31:59] <+samiscoolbro> Just wait pat
[2:31:59] <%bevyrage> if you don't have revive that fight is always hard. once you've cleared out all the ads you can revive your team and the grind at the end is easy and safe
[2:32:00] <%DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:32:00] <twohitgood> it looks so unnatural.
[2:32:02] <%AncelDeLambert> and you may ask yourself, where's my beautiful house?
[2:32:02] <Mattais88> Record scratch
[2:32:02] <korolev787> Having played ME1 about 8 times over, that fight is the hardest for me. The other fights tend to have more enemies but you are more well equipped to deal with them.
[2:32:02] <SaltyAzteca> WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK
[2:32:05] <%Eilocke> krogan battlemaster is the true reaper
[2:32:07] <%DJFakie> Tali is voiced by Ash Sroka, according to the Wiki, for those asking.
[2:32:08] <twohitgood> his knees are in a weird position.
[2:32:09] <satans_finest_millennial> ya this krogan is a brick shithouse
[2:32:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> Girl getting her suit breached left, right and center
[2:32:16] <dero45> ilol thats why u save insanity that would have been death
[2:32:19] <%barristerofthebar> Matriarch was always harder for me, since there was no where to hide
[2:32:25] <+mlow44> Upcoming Krogan fight is harder
[2:32:27] <%sporeian94> I like how the get grab their chest when they die
[2:32:31] <%DJFakie> It's just the one shot
[2:32:31] <Broken_Sonex> "YEP! THAT'S ME!"
[2:32:32] <%barristerofthebar> Now that there's actual cover systems, it might be better
[2:32:32] <%IamGrapes> to be continued [Roundabout playes]
[2:32:33] <+robosqueeb> out the end of your gun is where it went
[2:32:35] <+D00msDayDan> hit the railing lmao
[2:32:44] <Sigma_190_Beta> It hit the railing.
[2:32:46] <MonsterGills> carnage is shotgun only
[2:32:53] <%OrangeMDT> There was railing
[2:32:58] <%Varlinator> Carnage/Assassination go away if not fired after 5 seconds @PatStaresAt

[2:33:25] <+Gregmeyer> and now for an hour of me1 reloading glitch for max xp
[2:33:26] <%NateyBeak> did the carnage use toxic and he hit himself with it so he toxic'd himself?

[2:33:30] <%dankjerri> he get blue lady yet?

[2:33:42] <%Cykron> @even_the_yuenglings Tali is standing right there lol
[2:33:57] <+flexin_apex> @dero45 Noted lol
[2:33:57] <Sigma_190_Beta> You need to bring their shields down Pat.
[2:34:04] <+athuramn> look at those death tripods
[2:34:09] <%twistedj3ster> Wrex is also sterile, so he feels at home
[2:34:10] <%DJFakie> This DOT is brutal. Do soldiers recover from it faster?
[2:34:23] <%ScottishMadJacko> thats only in me2 and 3 I thought
[2:34:23] <%JamesCorck> Biotics are good against armor.
[2:34:24] <joodatious> krogens know alot about sterile things Kappa
[2:34:24] <%bread_assassin> @PatStaresAt In 1, they do.
[2:34:26] <+Totally_Not_Toby> that's a lie that's mass effect 2
[2:34:32] <%JamesCorck> Electronics are good against shields.
[2:34:34] <Deasmeister> In one they do
[2:34:36] <BeezusHrist> @Sigma_190_Beta That actually is not true in mass effect 1
[2:34:36] <+FelIian> ^
[2:34:40] <+Totally_Not_Toby> biotics work fine against shields in me1
[2:34:48] <%dankjerri> GIEF, GUN
[2:34:49] <%DJFakie> Armor-piercing is good for all geth
[2:34:51] <CappuccinoGuil> So what is gonna be this next girl's deal? She kicks puppies or something? We got some real winners so far LUL
[2:34:53] <+even_the_yuenglings> use tali to overload everything
[2:34:56] <%Varlinator> Kaiden says they look like bathroom tiles. When he did I said out loud "FFS Kaiden, why are you like this?!"
[2:34:56] <tanarath> @djfakie they get immunity, which gives your % dr.
[2:34:57] <+FelIian> yea they are kind of bad in me2
[2:34:58] <$lotharrio> I think the shields preventing biotics is an ME2/3, thing. Your problem this time was that you were trying to "throw" something that was flying. Which is resistant/immune to that.
[2:34:59] <Sigma_190_Beta> @BeezusHrist Really, that's weird.
[2:35:02] <+FelIian> unless you mod it like me
[2:35:09] <peanutdot007> How can you have different ammunition types when your gun shoots magic space dust?
[2:35:11] <tanarath> 75% to 95 or 100% for the duration
[2:35:16] <+SinnerEbru> wish me luck chat, im about to go have a sex
[2:35:18] <dero45> the three burst pistol is so sexy
[2:35:18] <Lodestarrobot> why do the lalafell walk like cotton hill does anyone know
[2:35:24] <BeezusHrist> @Sigma_190_Beta those mechanics are not introduced until 2

[2:35:32] <%RoggleJr> Bubble girl.
[2:35:33] <%DJFakie> Yeyeyeyeyeye
[2:35:35] <dero45> pistol is pretty much a sniper
[2:35:37] <TomFrancis_> BLOOBA
[2:35:38] <AthenaAegis> I seem to remember pistols becoming op in ME1
[2:35:42] <CrypticMochi> Biotics work on everything in 1, it’s why Bastion Adept turn insane into a ragdoll circus
[2:35:44] <%hrbeck_> hrbeck_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! 35 months! That's almost three years! Which is almost 5 years, that's half way to a decade! That's when all this shit started going down hill. Anyways- could you say, in a clean rip  "Hail to me, the king babby!"
[2:35:45] <ape_hawk> liara looks WORSE, omg
[2:35:45] <%barristerofthebar> Man she sounds so weird
[2:35:46] <+Totally_Not_Toby> shut up, Lightning
[2:35:46] <%AncelDeLambert> and then just WALK AWAY
[2:35:48] <SaltyAzteca> This fight is a challenge I think
[2:35:49] <%sporeian94> This scene is super funny if liara is literally the last thing you do in the game because she goes crazy and thinks you're a hallucination
[2:35:50] <SlippedDisco> hey cutie rooAww
[2:35:55] <%IamGrapes> I like the milf alien chick more from ME2 then Liara
[2:35:56] <+FelIian> Liara gets so much cooler in ME2
[2:35:57] <+mel0dica> step shepard
[2:36:00] <ioci2112> liara has massive milkers in me3, if you compare her to her model in me1 the difference is insane
[2:36:01] <Lamokmok> Hi Blue Lightning

[2:36:19] <%sporeian94> STEP-SHEPARD I'M TRAPPED
[2:36:28] <%joodatious> ME1 its pistols, ME2 its SMGs, ME3 its shotguns
[2:36:28] <Broken_Sonex> @Javi9563 She had a growth spurt after 2 years!
[2:36:31] <trianglehat> help me step-Shepard, I'm stuck
[2:36:33] <korolev787> Liara was a pretty rubbish character in ME1, far too milquetoast to be interesting. She gets much better in ME2 and ME3.
[2:36:34] <yourliteraldog> Stuck in wall
[2:36:45] <+Big_Hudson> wait wtf shes LIGHTNING
[2:36:49] <%unstablebeast19> @patstaresat do you plan to romance tali? or are you going liara this game and skipping tali in 2?......we all know you're not choosing ashley
[2:36:53] <%joodatious> Liara becomes
[2:36:59] <+even_the_yuenglings> oh no the krogan room monkaS
[2:37:00] <+ghostfaceninja_> I bet she has to pee super bad

[2:37:09] <SaltyAzteca> He Wrex stuff :3
[2:37:09] <SlippedDisco> monkaS krogan warlord
[2:37:12] <+FelIian> @korolev787 agreed, a lot of characters get way better in ME2, Garrus only becomes a bro in 2
[2:37:14] <%Eilocke> this krogan is pretty good though
[2:37:16] <%JamesCorck> Gief is your own personal Krogan, Pat <3
[2:37:18] <CurrentQuiet> !uptime
[2:37:18] <@Moobot> @CurrentQuiet I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 37m.
[2:37:19] <dero45> idk ur krogan dont have immunity
[2:37:22] <Kizza360> The best krogan

[2:37:35] <%DJFakie> Pistol is SUPER GOOD in ME1, Pat.
[2:37:37] <SaltyAzteca> wow the pistol owns
[2:37:37] <gralho> bang bang
[2:37:37] <AmuserName> STINGER 2 IS A GOD
[2:37:38] <%joodatious> @FelIian Garrus then becomes the absolute best in ME3
[2:37:39] <Mattais88> I just realized that there's no krogan party member in Me3...
[2:37:42] <%jaggstar2020> don't be fooled, that's a house plant playing human
[2:37:49] <%DJFakie> As a soldier, I use the pistol 95% of the game.
[2:37:52] <Broken_Sonex> So are we just gonna start calling Asari tits BlOOBA's? Just so it's clear.
[2:37:54] <ape_hawk> that geth had a family, family, family
[2:38:12] <BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt PISTOL + MARKSMAN in ME1 until you get plasma rounds for the endgame.
[2:38:12] <+FelIian> as a Sentinel, pistols in ME2 are kind of sad
[2:38:13] <yourliteraldog> Engineer squad rise up
[2:38:19] <+MightyDuckShoes> You think Bioware regrets how they handled Wrex?
[2:38:21] <%unstablebeast19> I'm so glad I played infiltrator, snipers is legendary 1 are busted
[2:38:30] <dero45> raikov pistole is the best imo
[2:38:38] <+FelIian> in LE Snipers are busted in general
[2:38:39] <dero45> pistol
[2:38:40] <+even_the_yuenglings> sentinel all the way

[2:38:44] <xcompleasedad> EDGE
[2:38:49] <$lotharrio> More and better goo for your bullets.
[2:38:54] <%DJFakie> That laser sight pistol is pretty rad in 2
[2:39:00] <%Varlinator> So much faster/easier than the PS5 version

[2:51:06] <%transporterthesequel> Wasn't she just goin on that 50 years aint shit
[2:51:08] <$SGrim> It's time to share the uncomfortable math again. Asari regularly live to 1000 before age wears them down. Humans, without intervention, usualy die from age at about 75 to 80. Bye that logic, Liara has lived a little more than 10% of her life span, and is 8 at best in human terms.

[2:52:24] <$SGrim> @ScottishMadJacko hence "without intervention," also, she'd just be 12. That's not better,.

[2:57:28] <+CptBritches> Ah yes, """"""reapers"""""
[2:57:29] <GandhiTheTerrible> The Council is terrible
[2:57:31] <Lamokmok> Especially the bird one
[2:57:33] <Mattais88> It really makes you want to let them die
[2:57:33] <+Punchasaur> GRAPPLE AWAY
[2:57:33] <+OmegaWeltall> Ahh yes, "Reapers"
[2:57:35] <Teras_ode> good
[2:57:37] <%Dakuu75> no? Worth it.

[2:57:42] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt Fun fact: The Salarian Councillor is voiced by Armin Shimmerman aka Quark from DS9

[2:57:42] <stantheman_97> "uh oh im going through a space tunnel"
[2:57:44] <ketchuo13> Ahh yes, "Reapers"

[2:57:48] <Dabrikishaw> Sparatus exists solely to bust your balls
[2:57:51] <wolfen091> salarian one isn't bad, he always agrees for the mission.  other two suck
[2:57:51] <%JoshManVGH> Just every time!? for free!?
[2:57:52] <sgtbloopface> noooooooooo
[2:57:52] <%joodatious> sadly its still probably best to save them in the end due to later things
[2:57:54] <TioXyco> you're a spectre, you can do whatever you want
[2:57:55] <%ScottishMadJacko> I save them to keep the destiny ascension
[2:57:56] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Do they ever get better? Or do they ever get replaced to not assholes?
[2:57:56] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Thank you so much Joker, Icing their comms is super great
[2:57:56] <Drunkengen> Ahh Yes "Reapers"
[2:57:57] <ShudMirelurk> ahh yes, """""" Reapers """"""
[2:57:59] <+InternetShis> Awww cmoooon
[2:58:01] <HollowMan190> WAT
[2:58:03] <aiutare47> But it gets funnier every single time
[2:58:05] <%jaggstar2020> muted council on space twitter
[2:58:06] <dero45> presley u bitch

[2:58:08] <$hattrick61> NO
[2:58:08] <%ScottishMadJacko> that ship is too cool to let die
[2:58:10] <aiutare47> 2-3 make them way better
[2:58:11] <+JaseAdrift> THEY STILL SUCK THOUGH
[2:58:11] <%sporeian94> They are barely in 2
[2:58:12] <%DJFakie> "Are you calling again just to hang up?" "You know it!"
[2:58:13] <asurite_warrior> @PatStaresAt I mean I kinda see it as their job to be assholes. Still it's a bit off how they keep up the reaper denial in the future
[2:58:13] <iosephe> Your arms look extremely silly when walking
[2:58:14] <%joodatious> because the other option basically all die immediately in 3
[2:58:18] <%sporeian94> POLITICIANS ARE ALL ASSHOLES
[2:58:24] <GandhiTheTerrible> they improve EVER so slightly
[2:58:27] <+Punchasaur> Left them on read
[2:58:28] <T_Sasquatch> Honestly i feel like the game over does trying to make players hate the Council.  They're dicks but from their perspective they aren't particularly wrong
[2:58:30] <CrypticMochi> The replacement council in 2 sucks way more
[2:58:34] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> That's bullshit, no way hanging up mid call doesn't give renegade points
[2:58:35] <%joodatious> literally save the council because the ship is so awesome
[2:58:35] <%AzureGale> LUL
[2:58:36] <%dekkitout> "Ya know, it kinda makes no sense that I'm functionally capable to hang up on yall- anyways I'm hanging up..."

[2:58:41] <peanutdot007> Oh man that beard after seven weeks is sad yeah
[2:58:42] <dero45> they not really assholes they just making sure you doing the right thing
[2:58:46] <%sporeian94> He's a pathetic beta male and can't grow a beard
[2:58:46] <SaltyAzteca> BEARD GAME WEAK JOKER
[2:58:47] <%Jeemukun> look man, some of us can't grow a beard
[2:58:48] <+Alopekis> I mean, they aren't that bad. Part of the problem is just that Shepard keeps telling them shit and not giving them any actual reason for them to believe him aside from "I saw it" which is pretty bad evidence to go off of when the decision they make can affect a shit ton of people.
[2:58:48] <jorniev> JUST showing up and i still cant stand that weird run pat teached me to hate
[2:58:50] <+even_the_yuenglings> pat he has boneitis
[2:58:52] <%Monkeyweed21> thats like 1 week
[2:58:53] <ketchuo13> Hey man, I cant grow a beard unless it's 2 months
[2:58:54] <%ScottishMadJacko> yeah, the replacement council is even worse somehow
[2:58:55] <+SilverDevilfish> "I have to go now, the galaxy needs me"
[2:58:57] <%zyberion626> individually the councillors are okay, as a whole though they suck
[2:58:57] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Humblebrag
[2:58:58] <%Maids4lyfe> space makes beards grow slow
[2:58:59] <+HefestoForges> that's like 3 months for me
[2:58:59] <8th_nel> stop flexing your hair pat
[2:59:01] <+FelIian> that's like 26 years for me
[2:59:01] <+HefestoForges> LUL
[2:59:01] <+JaseAdrift> Pat people grow hair at different times
[2:59:02] <ShudMirelurk> Joker isn't balding though. Hair resources are harder to come by.
[2:59:02] <SweetCuppingCake> you leave him alone, his bones are weak
[2:59:02] <+ghostfaceninja_> yes Pat, you're the very image of testosterone
[2:59:08] <dero45> maybe the turian guy is a asshole
[2:59:08] <+black_pariah> thats about a week for me
[2:59:08] <%IamGrapes> @dero45 nah they assholes
[2:59:09] <%dankjerri> KISS THAT MAN
[2:59:11] <%shadowsofpain> wow, you can take your good beard genes Pat I'm still tall
[2:59:13] <jorniev> uuugh that weird run
[2:59:14] <%Monkeyweed21> seth green was well used
[2:59:15] <%joodatious> council is rarely wrong in ME1 though, all of this stuff does sound like bullshit
[2:59:16] <Latija> why does he have a big head and little tank arms?
[2:59:16] <%Order_of_Mystery> Joker's got weak bones and weak beard game, not his fault
[2:59:19] <GandhiTheTerrible> gooooooood the normandy theme is stuck in my head
[2:59:21] <Drunkengen> Is it bad i like the New verison of the Normandy?
[2:59:23] <Teras_ode> I need two days and I'll have a full bandit beard by then
[2:59:23] <+OmegaWeltall> i NEVER talked to kaiden
[2:59:23] <%baronouroboros> Imagine if Shephard was a literal shepherd of sheep, but since he's also the chosen one his name is also symbolic.
[2:59:25] <%jaggstar2020> already sweating
[2:59:33] <+JaseAdrift> Pat Shepard looks longingly into Kaidan's eyes

[2:59:45] <+Alopekis> The Turian councilor is a bit of a prick, but the other two aren't that bad. They just haven't actually been good reason to believe the stuff Shepard is telling them.

[3:07:25] <BlueBiscuitGT> Pat go UP
[3:07:28] <%IamGrapes> i think Liara is the most boring romance to achieve. its so easy to do
[3:07:29] <%hrbeck_> alussy if you will
[3:07:30] <%walternatorz> pat's normal approach to talking to women for the first time
[3:07:32] <KaiserMario> Don't you always?
[3:07:34] <%dankjerri> ha
[3:07:36] <+razielhex> isn't she like 17 or some shit?
[3:07:39] <SiameseSneeze> I don't HATE Carth, he's just boring
[3:07:40] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> This LIGHTING
[3:07:40] <GandhiTheTerrible> Chakwas is great
[3:07:42] <Jaysky> I'd romance the doc
[3:07:46] <%transporterthesequel> she knows what's she's doing, EVEN WHEN SHE DOESN'T
[3:07:47] <Samurai_Tchan> HER EYES ARE WEIRD
[3:07:54] <dd44dostivei> @D00msDayDan man liara would suck on twitter
[3:07:57] <Broken_Sonex> @razielhex By Asari standards, so it's fine
[3:07:58] <%IamGrapes> @razielhex nah she's a hundred and somthin
[3:07:59] <+JaseAdrift> Chakwas would be  good romance
[3:07:59] <%twistedj3ster> "I never got to blow you for saving me"
[3:08:01] <+Punchasaur> I want kaidan's giant yaoi hand to grab Shepard’s face from off screen
[3:08:04] <aiutare47> @razielhex shes like 100 in dog years though so its fine
[3:08:05] <iosephe> even sex?
[3:08:06] <jorniev> imagine how crazy good a doctor you have to be to work on MULTIPLE SPECIES
[3:08:09] <+FelIian> 106
[3:08:10] <%Monkeyweed21> Chakwas has that hot old lady feel
[3:08:13] <Dabrikishaw> @42nfl19 Liking Carth is a very unpopular opinion, yes.
[3:08:13] <%shadowsofpain> @bigcoffee I get that but the animals=aliens comment is the fucking worst
[3:08:13] <%transporterthesequel> She's like EIGHT, who worked on a thesis for like six months Asari time.
[3:08:13] <$RealThiele> whatever she can
[3:08:15] <dero45> what ever you can ?
[3:08:17] <KeiPrime> thats Lightning.

[3:08:20] <%valriot> SEX UP THEM RIDGES
[3:08:21] <arkv01> they do not trust her but they want to dick her
[3:08:28] <+FelIian> my biggest issue is the romance happens SO QUICK in this game
[3:08:29] <%jaggstar2020> remote what?
[3:08:30] <James_Quivers> It's true, she isn't interesting
[3:08:32] <%CalderGaming> @jorniev i mean, vets,
[3:08:32] <%AzureGale> Liara WILL get interesting later
[3:08:33] <8th_nel> diggs you say
[3:08:34] <arkv01> trust = sex
[3:08:35] <%Undenizen> I once had the best glitch in ME2 where Shepherd's torso elongated by 2 meters mid-conversation, but the facial tracking still worked so the lady i spoke to was craning her neck casually.
[3:08:35] <+FelIian> like an hour after meeting Liara
[3:08:36] <%StrawberryPantsu> HEY LIKE HIS HELMET IN THE NEW TRAILER!?

[3:14:52] <%Arancet> Arancet subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! I can't believe it didn't take ten minutes after recruiting Liara that the starship commander is arguing with his subordinate over who gets fuck rights. For how tame the romances are its amazing how hard and fast it pushes the pros and cons of each on you
[3:14:52] <Samurai_Tchan> NOT A KROGAN ?

[3:14:54] <%shadowsofpain> oh yeah her dad's fucking cool
[3:14:57] <arkv01> from today on you'll call me daddy too
[3:14:57] <MagmaRam> Asari obviously don't actually take any traits from the other species, that's an evident load of bunk. They're just using the mental link as an RNG.

[3:15:27] <%JoshManVGH> We can brain fuck with anyone and have babies. but you can fuck amongst yourselves!?
[3:15:28] <ScreamLord> They fucked Space Dogs
[3:15:29] <+D00msDayDan> maybe the asari mated with animals all the time they were on their home planet
[3:15:29] <willyfreshness> CHICKENS HAVE EGGS?
[3:15:29] <ape_hawk> yes
[3:15:30] <%Dakuu75> this confuses me
[3:15:31] <dashmatt> Banging their local animals
[3:15:32] <James_Quivers> Yes
[3:15:33] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Thats a 2007 ass question

[3:16:54] <%Undenizen> Pat, Asari are CANONICALLY sleeping around with other species. They could be doing it with those verren.
[3:16:54] <MagmaRam> yeehaw
[3:16:54] <feralspidey> Believing that mating with your own species makes you weaker feels like the most extreme future alien prejudice...
[3:16:55] <%BigCoffee> Nah it's not that bad
[3:16:55] <T_Sasquatch> being "pure" is considered a bad thing

[3:17:17] <stantheman_97> i guess?
[3:17:17] <%facto905> KKona
[3:17:18] <%bread_assassin> Liara's GRANDfather was a Krogan.
[3:17:20] <%Varlinator> That's a stretch, Pat
[3:17:23] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Ehhhhh psaWrong
[3:17:26] <%SvenHolgersson> How WOULD incest affect Asari kids
[3:17:28] <+MightyDuckShoes> So it just makes Uncle Pat more natural for her
[3:17:28] <%joodatious> the main reason purebloods being taboo for asari is because of that one disease
[3:17:29] <%SvenHolgersson> Would it even?
[3:17:32] <+razielhex> H.T. PAT!  H.T. PAT!

[3:17:53] <%JoshManVGH> 1yeah okay thats a very "i fucked my cousin" sort of answer.
[3:17:54] <%joodatious> uncle pat just wants to sit all the pretty girls on his lap
[3:18:01] <+theedom> too much blue in you? Uncle pat can fix that!
[3:18:01] <asurite_warrior> Isnt it 2 you find out why asari really dont mate with another asari
[3:18:02] <CappuccinoGuil> So Asari are oops, all milfs?
[3:18:02] <heartlesshealer> xenophilic space elves

[3:18:15] <dero45> lol
[3:18:15] <Hassleglass> quantum marriage
[3:18:17] <xcompleasedad> @karl_rex It takes a couple of generations. But, they had to get to space somehow
[3:18:19] <+razielhex> @shadowsofpain Not necessarily; it just makes it more likely that recessive traits will manifest and that common mutations in chromosomes aren't repaired.
[3:18:20] <%JoshManVGH> So what's linking with a solarian like for them?
[3:18:20] <+CursedNobleman> @bread_assassin :(

[3:19:37] <%logoth_> your first conversation with liara is her explaing how her species bones
[3:19:39] <%MugenSandan> Her mom had ONE FINAL NUT

[3:21:05] <%JoshManVGH> i want a mod that replaces every shepard "I should go" conversation ender with JK Simmons saying "We're done here!"
[3:21:05] <Jaysky> oh.
[3:21:06] <%ScottishMadJacko> wow
[3:21:08] <+yoshkosh20> creepy uncle or leather daddy? we may never know.
[3:21:13] <+ThomasOfTroy> I think that locked out that dialogue branch now
[3:21:13] <+Alopekis> Rude
[3:21:13] <SiameseSneeze> oh... goodbye commander...
[3:21:14] <%DJFakie> Jeeez, never bailed out early from a Garrus talk
[3:21:15] <Lamokmok> Shut up Garrus!
[3:21:19] <tanarath> @brandonsbetow is it 1 mil creds + lvl 50?
[3:21:19] <Mattais88> I love the world building of telling you who makes each weapon
[3:21:21] <%baronouroboros> Based Wrex.
[3:21:23] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> I love how Garrus was all like "Oh, ok. I thought we were having a moment"
[3:21:26] <stantheman_97> oh...
[3:21:28] <%ScottishMadJacko> poor garrus
[3:21:36] <ScreamLord> ME1 was being EXTREMELY stingy with me as far as good medium human armor went. Not a single store ever had anything better than Scorpion VII. And yet I was alway getting Colossus armor for Wrex and Garrus
[3:21:39] <Mattais88> He sounds so combatative
[3:21:40] <BlockingDisabled> I like this story
[3:21:51] <%JohnAtDawn> FORESHADOWING
[3:21:57] <feralspidey> @RetroCop87 no, toliets don't have minds to meld with... unless it's the toliet in dbz abridged.
[3:22:00] <SaltyAzteca> Am I the only one who gets a John Goodman feel from Wrex?
[3:22:03] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> His sexy, sexy face
[3:22:06] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Wrex & this shep get drunk at a shitty bar and reminisce on their high school football days
[3:22:09] <balthazar758> wrex is ready to throw down 24/7
[3:22:20] <$Captainahab_37> why is wrex the BEST character?
[3:22:20] <Samurai_Tchan> Space Based
[3:22:21] <xcompleasedad> @SaltyAzteca You are right. Spot on
[3:22:22] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> I feel it too @SaltyAzteca Totally
[3:22:28] <%Undenizen> Wrex is KINDA a shitbag
[3:22:43] <DefaultSettiings> looking at your Shepard has killed my ability to perceive beauty anymore
[3:22:46] <$Captainahab_37> shitbags are the BEST
[3:22:48] <dero45> lol
[3:22:49] <%IamGrapes> @Undenizen yeah but he's OUR shitbag
[3:22:56] <Samurai_Tchan> wrex is the fusion of king kong with godzilla
[3:23:04] <%dekkitout> Wrex seems pretty (reasonably) based
[3:23:05] <karl_rex> I'm surprised they didn't make a new pre-geth arm model for Saren when they meant to originally
[3:23:22] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> I thought Wrex was a Gamera
[3:23:26] <Broken_Sonex> @Samurai_Tchan And the dog that wanted his turn on the xbox
[3:23:27] <%bread_assassin> Do side materials ever explain WHY Saren was doing this?
[3:23:35] <$Captainahab_37> Saren was after tons of Krogan porn
[3:23:37] <bonechamp4lyfe> is this a space ghost video game?
[3:23:41] <arkv01> good gut
[3:23:53] <Samurai_Tchan> @Samurai_Tchan why xbox ?
[3:23:54] <%sporeian94> @bread_assassin  I believe he was looking for Reaper artifacts are some shit
[3:23:54] <KaiserMario> You need to do some Cerberus shit for the good stuff, and then there's spectre stuff
[3:23:56] <%dekkitout> @BlowFireThroatTotem I wouldn't think of him as a friend to children, he probably tolerates their existence at best
[3:23:58] <%Undenizen> @bonechamp4lyfe yeah Zorac is coming soon
[3:24:02] <omglaserbeamspewpew> Mako look
[3:24:02] <$Captainahab_37> yeah you interview Conan in this game
[3:24:06] <%DJFakie> B-but Garrus...
[3:24:09] <heartlesshealer> I forgot, did you give Tali armor?
[3:24:09] <Mattais88> Get that team heal
[3:24:11] <+GuilKato> Shepards new way of saying goodbye to the crew is 'I love you' ?
[3:24:13] <%sporeian94> UNITY PAT
[3:24:19] <$Captainahab_37> Wrex is just buff Zorac
[3:24:23] <+even_the_yuenglings> unity is good
[3:24:25] <DefaultSettiings> he doesnt look like someone who would stop the reapers. he looks like someone who would deny me a loan at the bank
[3:24:27] <tanarath> Better throw
[3:24:28] <EldritchNeko> Hey pat just wanted to say i love VF 5 ultimate i picked it up because of you and its amazing

[3:26:01] <%Spydurman> LUL
[3:26:01] <+yoshkosh20> wasn't the normandy a joint project between the turians and the alliance?

[3:26:04] <%Ravioli_Ronin> TALI’S IN THE ENGINE RIGHT NOW

[3:27:10] <+even_the_yuenglings> OH YEAH
[3:27:15] <+Totally_Not_Toby> yeah but HUMANS are the pet dogs
[3:27:17] <asurite_warrior> @PatStaresAt I remember when I was in highschool I romanced Ashley because I kinda liked mean girls.
[3:27:18] <+samiscoolbro> Omg
[3:27:21] <+TheBitingIrish> Wow...
[3:27:22] <%GalacticaPhanto> GalacticaPhanto subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 27 months! 27 months lessgoooooo! First time celebrating Pride after coming out last year as Bisexual! Pat be super cool and say Gay Rights and make sure to give Giefy the most love on this special day!
[3:27:26] <+MightyDuckShoes> I remember that!!!
[3:27:27] <peanutdot007> Does the bear steal your bike?
[3:27:28] <+Punchasaur> She’s a fucking catty high school bitch
[3:27:28] <+redthebaron> she sucks
[3:27:30] <GandhiTheTerrible> jesus fucking christ, i remember
[3:27:30] <tanarath> LESSER
[3:27:31] <SaphronBlackbourne> Shepard needs some chapstick
[3:27:31] <+GuilKato> has pat plugged in the consorts ball to the random ruins
[3:27:33] <%Varlinator> SHE'S SO SPECIEST!
[3:27:36] <%JoshManVGH> Holy shit.
[3:27:36] <+Jack8274> Would you save your wife or dog?
[3:27:38] <%AzureGale> The Normandy is a Human-Turian collaboration, you fool
[3:27:40] <%sunsetdisc0> new drinking game: take a drink every time you see something that's aged poorly
[3:27:42] <SiameseSneeze> Is she insinuating they're pets
[3:27:43] <+robosqueeb> shes right...but
[3:27:44] <dashmatt> I saw a video today of  lady saving her dogs from a bear
[3:27:45] <+OG_M_Bison> I wish Ashley went on the suicide mission in 2 so you could kill her in many different ways
[3:27:45] <wasdsf> the other races that are literally more advanced
[3:27:45] <%Mr_Pylon> A Bear: "Ah yes, Reapers"
[3:27:46] <blue8moon> she also acts like the other species are basically animals
[3:27:46] <$Captainahab_37> i romanced tali cuz i wanna see her fucking faaaaaace
[3:27:46] <%Ravioli_Ronin> WOW
[3:27:46] <+Totally_Not_Toby> wha, no?
[3:27:48] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Can you even romance her without turning into a massive racist or something? Is there a way to change her for the better?
[3:27:48] <iosephe> Other sapient, communicating races no less
[3:27:53] <+Jack8274> Well yeah, humans are more important, that's how we eat meat
[3:27:54] <+CursedNobleman> @GalacticaPhanto BisexualPride
[3:27:54] <RushUnplugged> yes, Ashley, a sapient species that makes spaceships is 100% exactly like a dog, you RACIST
[3:27:57] <GandhiTheTerrible> GOD she is genuinely the worst
[3:27:57] <blackjack8182> Humans are the pet
[3:27:58] <%SvenHolgersson> God she's so awful
[3:27:59] <%shadowsofpain> to be fair the council would sell you out in a heart beat
[3:28:00] <%GarbageNirvana> She's really just a cunt the whole way through
[3:28:02] <asurite_warrior> @PatStaresAt I would be like that women that pushed the bear over the fence
[3:28:02] <+Totally_Not_Toby> that's literally the opposite of what she does
[3:28:02] <Mattais88> I always took it as "throw all those xenos in the woodchipper for human gain"
[3:28:04] <+even_the_yuenglings> DO IT
[3:28:06] <%SvenHolgersson> How likes her for real
[3:28:07] <%JoshManVGH> Isn't Citadel space aupposed to be a galactic community, like the United Federation of Planets?
[3:28:07] <%Reaviar> also she wouldnt 1v1 a bear for her dogs...what a loser
[3:28:10] <s1rcuit> also she assumes that everyone would pointlessly send the dog to its death so you can get away
[3:28:10] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> She's technically correct because the council are a bunch of selfish dweebs, but she's somehow completely wrong at the same time. It's an achievement.
[3:28:11] <+flexin_apex> Dog>humans
[3:28:12] <%AzureGale> Asking if she has time to talk, after you told her to fuck off. lol
[3:28:13] <James_Quivers> BYE
[3:28:14] <wasdsf> take her out to dinner and then NUKE HER
[3:28:15] <+objectivefailure> Oh, Ashley is still alive?  Well, something to look forward to I guess.
[3:28:15] <+Totally_Not_Toby> and also the council fucks you every chance they get
[3:28:15] <Alzero83> If you decide to bang ashley, You Rough her up ALOT while you pound that ass, Pat
[3:28:15] <%Dakuu75> take her out to dinner than run and stick her with the bill
[3:28:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Dumb you AND leave her with the bill
[3:28:19] <%Undenizen> EVERYONE hates Ashley. She only exists because racism.
[3:28:20] <%maskofmichael> She sounds so horny when she says "talk to you later"
[3:28:20] <ScreamLord> Bitch I am your Commander and if I want to talk we're gonna fucking talk.
[3:28:21] <tanarath> @42nfl19 yes, you can blunt her open racism.
[3:28:22] <SaltyAzteca> Bang the aliens and make her watch
[3:28:25] <%sporeian94> @42nfl19 Yes by the end of the game you can convince her to change her view, same with Kaiden. You can make Kaiden a council skeptic than an apologist
[3:28:27] <dero45> 3 more main missions
[3:28:28] <%StrawberryPantsu> COP
[3:28:29] <peanutdot007> "Shoot dudes"
[3:28:29] <%DJFakie> I like how it's not "Hey, Garrus" and just "Answer this question"
[3:28:29] <Profmcstevie> Call her the morning after your dinner date and TELL HER IT WAS AWFUL
[3:28:31] <%Dakuu75> HE'S BATMAN
[3:28:31] <+yoshkosh20> nah. you gotta sit through the whole meal. then bail and leave her with the bill.
[3:28:32] <%StrawberryPantsu> FUCKIN COP
[3:28:36] <%transporterthesequel> he wanted to legally murder people, like all police
[3:28:38] <%Deft_Thought> "I wanted to help people"
[3:28:42] <%IamGrapes> Taker her out to dinner and not show up, even tho you're both on the same ship
[3:28:43] <+ThomasOfTroy> On the citadel, Ashley literally says "I can't tell the aliens from the animals"
[3:28:47] <tanarath> Shell probably never totally change, but she wont be an open bigot.
[3:28:47] <%Deft_Thought> Then be a mechanic
[3:28:51] <%JoshManVGH> Idealized hero cop.
[3:28:52] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt Isn't the Normandy a human and turian collaboration project?
[3:28:53] <Zulrez> so pat, is ashley going to live up to her nickname?
[3:28:59] <+redthebaron> yeah the garrus got a job because his daddy plotline
[3:29:00] <%GalacticaPhanto> Wait so he's like Ashley where he comes from a family of cops?
[3:29:01] <$Faustgesicht> Wish you met his dad
[3:29:04] <+mai_waifu_> "I wanna help people by murdering people."
[3:29:06] <+Punchasaur> I would throw myself in front of a bear for my dog. He’s a sweet boy who never hurt anybody
[3:29:06] <$Captainahab_37> Garrus is one cool asshole
[3:29:10] <pmk4609> man i never realized ashley was such a shithead, i only got a weird intro to her through the ME 2 comic lol
[3:29:10] <%Dakuu75> YEAH, remember kids. If you try and fail, it means you shouldn't have tried at all
[3:29:11] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Garrus “the pigs” vakarian
[3:29:14] <aiutare47> Ashley was always weird like that, I almost agree with her on the military intelligence thing, especially with people like the Salarians and the Turians who would stab you in the back without hesitation. But she always has to add racism into it.
[3:29:17] <BlueBiscuitGT> To be fair, Garrus does become Sniper Batman in ME 2
[3:29:22] <Mattais88> Hes worried you'll go on a vigilante crusade and eat a rpg in a last stand
[3:29:22] <dd44dostivei> i think your dad's right, man
[3:29:27] <%luckysteak> Garrus' dad is right
[3:29:29] <SiameseSneeze> Garrus, I will fuck your dad
[3:29:30] <stantheman_97> understandable
[3:29:30] <+even_the_yuenglings> LuL
[3:29:32] <dero45> i never talked to garrus until 2 he was my boi then
[3:29:35] <%dekkitout> Your dad sounds alright for a pig
[3:29:39] <SaltyAzteca> Lawful Turians are lawful
[3:29:41] <tanarath> @galacticaphanto I mean, everyone serves in the turian military one way or another
[3:29:42] <Vantesla> What she said was extreme, but taken out of context. Ashley mention of pets is in general saying if Council races lost use in humans they be abandoned. Also saying in same humans to the council races. at least that was the meaning a dev way back gave I recall.
[3:29:47] <%AzureGale> UNLIMITED POWER *zaps with lightning fingers*
[3:29:50] <+yoshkosh20> I wouldn't trust my impressionable children around uncle shep either.
[3:29:51] <%zyberion626> Ashley may have points but they're obfuscated by her bluntness
[3:29:52] <asurite_warrior> The only humans I liked in these games were jack, Miranda, Zaeed and Kasumi
[3:29:54] <%sunsetdisc0> garrus likes to think of himself as dirty harry, but really he's more like george zimemrman
[3:29:55] <%shadowsofpain> on the micro scale she's super right, the council would leave humans to die. On the macro scale she's so nihilistically wrong
[3:30:00] <peanutdot007> Saren being unrestricted is in fact the big problem yeah
[3:30:04] <+GuilKato> Tell Garrus he's adorable!
[3:30:06] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Yeah but Garrus wants to murder
[3:30:06] <Alzero83> Be a BRo, Garrus
[3:30:07] <%Dakuu75> awww, he a good lad
[3:30:09] <RushUnplugged> also "this is the best ship in the Alliance" but the Turians built half of it, they KNOW how it works
[3:30:09] <+senfood> Garrus, you're so hot please stop being a bad cop.
[3:30:15] <%JoshManVGH> You're BETTER than that Garrus!
[3:30:16] <+JaseAdrift> And then he will ignore it
[3:30:18] <%Varlinator> You're a loose canon, Garrus!
[3:30:22] <+robosqueeb> I don't need to be bad! Or ally myself with mysterious black market people in the future, no way
[3:30:23] <GandhiTheTerrible> LUL
[3:30:24] <%barristerofthebar> WOW
[3:30:24] <%transporterthesequel> So we got a cop, a speciest, and a child.

[3:30:44] <Sp3ctre48> He came into this talk so aggressively LUL

[3:30:56] <$DeeJayOkay> the baaaaaaaaaby
[3:30:57] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Garrus "I'll think about what you said" Ashley "Whatever "
[3:30:58] <%valriot> "Space Week huh, good job your into Tampon Suit"
[3:31:02] <+Ropcord> ELMP

[3:31:09] <James_Quivers> @PatStaresAt You better bang Tali in 2, she's the best
[3:31:10] <%Ravioli_Ronin> psaBlep psaBlep psaBlep
[3:31:10] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt So how does Garrus start as a Boyscout into a renegade vigilante in 2?
[3:31:16] <$Captainahab_37> what the FUCK is it this time Tali?
[3:31:17] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> "you see I have this really fat dog"
[3:31:28] <Mattais88> Too used to being poor
[3:31:30] <+Daigrey> Their flotilla is a fucking Chevy
[3:31:31] <Alzero83> Tali is the BEST
[3:31:32] <dd44dostivei> humans are apparently less racist to quarians than council species
[3:31:33] <%Varlinator> I love that this comes back in 3 if you romance her
[3:31:35] <%immortanjoestar> pat why do you always make yourself in the char creator?
[3:31:40] <asurite_warrior> I wish we got to see more of the flotilla.
[3:31:40] <%IamGrapes> its like when you live in the city and then stay at a relative that live in the country, and you cant sleep without the sound of traffic
[3:31:42] <SaltyAzteca> homesick, awwww
[3:31:46] <aiutare47> @42nfl19 he always wanted to be a vigilante, he just decided to stop pretending without Shepards good influence
[3:31:59] <%Deft_Thought> NO! Find good shit and come home, idiot!
[3:32:01] <arkv01> @immortanjoestar its not quite him, its pat but rapier
[3:32:06] <%shadowsofpain> I do feel bad for Tali and her people, but they brought it on themselves
[3:32:07] <dero45> i feel that i cant have it be too quite i start to focus on every sound like im superman
[3:32:08] <%JoshManVGH> Why do Quarian suits have a blinking light on their mouthpiece that draws your attention to their mouths, instead of their very obvious eyes?
[3:32:08] <42nfl19> "We regret to inform you that we do not have the power to render more crewmates"
[3:32:09] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> Tali best waifu though
[3:32:09] <%CalderGaming> like with the amish, maybe
[3:32:12] <James_Quivers> Like the Amish
[3:32:14] <$Captainahab_37> there's like 10 dudes doing space ship work on the deck
[3:32:15] <asurite_warrior> Mass Effect universe would be really cool without a ever closing in disaster.
[3:32:15] <+Alopekis> Garrus isn't a boyscout. He couldn't be more open about his disdain for rules and regulations getting in the way.
[3:32:15] <+Punchasaur> Does space even have night time
[3:32:19] <+NeonLight> LUL
[3:32:19] <+even_the_yuenglings> LuL

[3:32:24] <+CursedNobleman> LUL
[3:32:26] <Alzero83> but we need Toast, Pat
[3:32:29] <SaltyAzteca> "Are we the baddies?"
[3:32:30] <balthazar758> ahh, oh fuck
[3:32:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Don't murder your toasters
[3:32:32] <%Deft_Thought> @PatStaresAt Your toaster doesn't shoot at you, Pat
[3:32:32] <James_Quivers> tbf, those toasters have guns
[3:32:33] <dero45> happens to the best of them
[3:32:43] <%Ranryu692> every time I see @PatStaresAt's Shepard I can't help but think of that one guy from the Past Tense episodes of DS9
[3:32:45] <Broken_Sonex> MAKES YOU THINK EYY, TALI
[3:32:45] <%Order_of_Mystery> Toasters? Pat c'mon, Geth are lamps
[3:32:45] <%dekkitout> You think humans are the only culture in the ME universe that have cautionary tales of rogue AI?
[3:32:46] <Jaysky> I should go
[3:32:47] <%W1nterTitan> Tali is so sweet
[3:32:47] <+megaman_sentinel> I think my toaster is evil though Pat
[3:32:54] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> Yeah I’d leave Ashley on a random exploding planet
[3:32:54] <Vantesla> @dd44dostivei There is a story reason. Humans weren't part of galactic society till way after the Geth war.
[3:32:57] <Zeif00> "good luck with that"
[3:32:58] <heartlesshealer> I just fucking noticed, you can see eyes and a nose behind her faceplate
[3:32:59] <balthazar758> that huffing cracks me up lol
[3:33:01] <+JaseAdrift> Tali is the best
[3:33:05] <aiutare47> Not in ME
[3:33:05] <Lamokmok> What toaster has artificial intelligence
[3:33:07] <%AzureGale> I don't
[3:33:08] <blue8moon> I never do
[3:33:08] <Alzero83> this game is a Lie, Pat could never run that far without stopping
[3:33:08] <+GlassesFreek> Not true
[3:33:08] <thetunnelhomer> Aaaand back. Hope I didn't miss anything good.
[3:33:09] <xcompleasedad> @Deft_Thought The Quarians literally tortured the geth when they started to become sentient
[3:33:09] <FennecZephyr> I used the default Femshep
[3:33:10] <%StrawberryPantsu> Yeah... Sure...
[3:33:11] <+TheBitingIrish> I just used default :)
[3:33:12] <ne0bunny> I always make an OC
[3:33:12] <Mattais88> Unless you go opposite gender
[3:33:12] <+even_the_yuenglings> abominations get old
[3:33:12] <%shadowsofpain> a toaster picked up a widowmaker it was over
[3:33:13] <%afronooch> I wanna play Me in space sometimes
[3:33:13] <%zyberion626> if my toaster asked me if it had a soul, I'd just shrug and ask it to not burn my sourdough
[3:33:13] <aiutare47> ME is the best example of default only for me
[3:33:13] <James_Quivers> or a horrible fleshbeast
[3:33:14] <+FelIian> I don't
[3:33:14] <%Mr_Pylon> huh, never done that actually
[3:33:14] <%MisterRockett> I don't, I make a dark skinned black woman named Rhonda.
[3:33:15] <%barristerofthebar> Not my mixed ass!
[3:33:15] <%Nekros4442> Thats why the most popular character is always white male
[3:33:15] <Shardlab> I don't
[3:33:16] <RetributionP> nope
[3:33:16] <Samaugsch2> In me3, i sided with the toasters over the quarians
[3:33:16] <xbb1024> I never make myself in character creator
[3:33:17] <+JaseAdrift> You always start with a character that is just you
[3:33:17] <+OG_M_Bison> Imagine playing chode head Shepard LUL
[3:33:17] <+yoshkosh20> I don't. I wanna be hawt.
[3:33:17] <%JoshManVGH> Like they don't even suffer a mass kill off like Battle Star Galactica. Why has finding a planet been so hard for them?
[3:33:17] <$TallYoda08> same
[3:33:17] <+Rekinsinn> is there a study for that
[3:33:17] <+MrSuplexArt> I always play the opposite sex
[3:33:18] <+FoolsArcade> I play femshep cause, maleshep sucks
[3:33:18] <%AzureGale> My created characters are hot, for starters
[3:33:18] <Broken_Sonex> I dunno HOW to
[3:33:19] <+Philoceraptors> that is false
[3:33:19] <illtima> lol no
[3:33:19] <%immortanjoestar> i dont make myself, thats weird
[3:33:20] <%Monkeyweed21> I dont thats fuckin lame
[3:33:21] <%Dehlome> I like the default shepards in ME better
[3:33:21] <+D00msDayDan> i always play default shepard
[3:33:22] <dd44dostivei> i dont
[3:33:22] <T_Sasquatch> well i cant because games have shit options for black people hair
[3:33:22] <%dekkitout> @Lamokmok The Brave Little Toaster
[3:33:23] <%twistedj3ster> I make a better version of myself
[3:33:23] <+trizetacannon44> I make hotter me
[3:33:24] <TomFrancis_> first playthrough i always make myself
[3:33:24] <Profmcstevie> I flick through RANDOM till I like what I see
[3:33:25] <CappuccinoGuil> Bro, what, I played as a bearded lady with green hair in Saints Row IV, what are you talking about? LUL
[3:33:25] <Sigma_190_Beta> Not in ME, the default looks good.
[3:33:26] <%Dakuu75> everyone does that, dude. sometimes Rule 63
[3:33:26] <%Order_of_Mystery> I would've, but default male Shepherd looks good
[3:33:26] <%Ranryu692> @Lamokmok the Brave Little Toaster
[3:33:27] <Zeif00> I make a character I want to fuck
[3:33:28] <moony_stream> nope
[3:33:28] <BlueBiscuitGT> I don't, most of the time. In ME I played basic MaleShep
[3:33:28] <stantheman_97> i used to then realized i could make someone cool
[3:33:28] <sgtbloopface> ive never done that lol
[3:33:29] <+Epic_Fubar> not me
[3:33:29] <dero45> i try but games never have afros
[3:33:30] <%IamGrapes> Quarians are the race who deserved the situation they are in more then anything in any fiction
[3:33:30] <viewtifulr> pretty much yeah or a cooler varient youWISHED
[3:33:30] <BenLanBen> not in this game, this game's CC sucks, deafult shopardo ftw
[3:33:31] <Lodestarrobot> i always make sexy pink haired lady and I'm a chubby brown haired man
[3:33:31] <s1rcuit> most of the time I don't even touch the character creator
[3:33:33] <asurite_warrior> I got a bunch of DND characters I usually pick from in character creators.
[3:33:33] <tanarath> Pat does it because he does it & it's funny in this instance
[3:33:34] <roboyuji> I almost never do
[3:33:34] <%RaziWraith> and even if you don't make yourself, you probably make an idealized version
[3:33:35] <%Order_of_Mystery> Mark Meer is a handsome man
[3:33:37] <Slim_Lipid> sure but why would you choose to be bald
[3:33:40] <mr_saturday93> narcissism
[3:33:40] <HiggsV> "If I can't make me, make an OC"
[3:33:40] <+FelIian> ME character creator isn't great
[3:33:40] <%Deft_Thought> I tried to make myself in the character creator but the game had a hard time not making you look like a grandpa if you wanted to be black
[3:33:41] <+Punchasaur> Uhhhh
[3:33:42] <nevan_44> i dont
[3:33:42] <+Philoceraptors> i dont play games to look at myself
[3:33:43] <Deasmeister> Nope I always role play as someone else usually a different gender too
[3:33:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> God I forgot how much of an absolute shit Ashley is.
[3:33:47] <xbb1024> I play games to be someone else. I don't need to play as space IT support
[3:33:47] <+GuilKato> do you go back to the citadel or do you scrape every single planet for dialgoues?
[3:33:48] <%sporeian94> IS IT VIOLATE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS TIME!?!?!
[3:33:48] <$Captainahab_37> what you DONT want to be a space captain?
[3:33:48] <%SvenHolgersson> That cut!
[3:33:49] <Shardlab> Remember, Pat. You don't excercise your imagination. Most of the rest of us DO
[3:33:49] <$ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Even the Salarians, War Crime lovers who definitely have AI, don't do stupid shit like the Quarians did
[3:33:50] <dd44dostivei> why would i play as myself. i suck
[3:33:51] <%Deft_Thought> @xcompleasedad Oh I know
[3:33:52] <+ghostfaceninja_> I tend to go opposite gender and species myself
[3:33:53] <+black_pariah> i always make a tan girl with green eyes
[3:33:53] <%JoshManVGH> Humanity has been in space way less time than they have and we've settled like what? 19 planets? What's the quarians deal?
[3:33:54] <%Order_of_Mystery> THIS BITCH
[3:33:59] <BlackIronClam> I've never been good at creating characters so I just make MONSTROSETIES
[3:34:00] <ape_hawk> nassana dentist, got it
[3:34:01] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Always go for OCs
[3:34:01] <%SvenHolgersson> Ah yes "Blussy"
[3:34:03] <+GingerStrawhat> Aw yeah dis bitch
[3:34:04] <%HairballCT> oh hey it's grey delisle
[3:34:05] <%DJFakie> @Lamokmok Aegis
[3:34:05] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> Lol yeah ME is one game where I don’t mess with the character creator.
[3:34:11] <%embranz> is that Azula's VA
[3:34:13] <+melanthia_> I made me in ME but it was ugly so I became a girl IRL so character creators would suck less
[3:34:13] <$Captainahab_37> the citadel is fuckin cool
[3:34:17] <%logoth_> Absorb the blussy
[3:34:18] <%JoshManVGH> Also isn't that what the Citadel is for?
[3:34:18] <%Deft_Thought> Hey commander, your ship is ON FIRE
[3:34:20] <SaphronBlackbourne> Meanwhile here I side with the Quarians in 3 if I have to
[3:34:24] <thetunnelhomer> Why does the Normandy always look on fire when going FTL?
[3:34:29] <+FelIian> I never got that message, did the quest by accident before LUL
[3:34:29] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> The created characters don’t look as good as the default
[3:34:31] <%zyberion626> @joshmanvgh aquarian biology is very sensitive
[3:34:33] <Dunmarkh> BLUSSY GANG BLUSSY GANG
[3:34:36] <%SvenHolgersson> I show you some fast loads- Space Pat
[3:34:37] <aiutare47> @JoshManVGH Existence outside the suit is toxic and Quarian politics prevent colonization in short
[3:34:38] <%sporeian94> The best load screen are ME2 elevator because it's instant and skips the entire animation they made for it
[3:34:39] <+even_the_yuenglings> I remember reading all the little descriptions of the planets when I first played this
[3:34:42] <$Captainahab_37> i never played 3 is it worth a playthrough
[3:34:43] <%saiko2208> That Joker message coming in sound used to be my ringtone for like 5 years
[3:34:43] <+GingerStrawhat> Alright Pressley watch the ship
[3:34:44] <%DJFakie> @Lamokmok Or, I guess Aigis
[3:34:47] <%Varlinator> It's great on the PS5's SSD too
[3:34:49] <+ThomasOfTroy> I always genderswap, specifically because when I played femshep she threatened to beat the shit out of harkin for hitting on her
[3:34:53] <%JoshManVGH> "Hey space government, we're in exile, could you help us ID some possible planets?"
[3:34:54] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> BREAKING NEWS!!: The Citadel is SUPER-Cool!
[3:34:54] <%DJFakie> :D
[3:34:56] <%W1nterTitan> Oh yeah my A-Team
[3:34:56] <%dekkitout> Garry and Larry
[3:34:57] <Dunmarkh> NICE
[3:35:01] <BenLanBen> liarus
[3:35:02] <+even_the_yuenglings> BEST SQUAD
[3:35:03] <thetunnelhomer> @Captainahab_37 Just one, and only if you really care.
[3:35:03] <%IamGrapes> that's not Wrex, Pat, what you doing
[3:35:04] <dero45> time to float some fools
[3:35:07] <+OG_M_Bison> @Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1 Imagine unironically thinking Chode Shepard looks better than Pat Shepard
[3:35:07] <zachpaladin> Garrus and Liara were my go-to crew
[3:35:10] <satans_finest_millennial> this is the correct squad
[3:35:11] <heartlesshealer> give liara armor
[3:35:12] <Samaugsch2> @zyberion626 If my toaster asked, i’d tell it that it had multiple souls in it like ermac from mortal kombat
[3:35:12] <dero45> she stole it
[3:35:12] <brexdq> team blue
[3:35:17] <%Varlinator> It's a spare
[3:35:17] <thetunnelhomer> Red oni blue oni
[3:35:17] <+GingerStrawhat> The most based of armor: the base armor
[3:35:20] <%Deft_Thought> A lot of games don't give good options if you want to make a dark-skinned character so sometimes I won't mess around with the character creator at all
[3:35:21] <+FelIian> Tali and Garrus all the way
[3:35:21] <%Dakuu75> what's "XO" stand for here?
[3:35:29] <+even_the_yuenglings> tfw no biotic explosions in me1 FeelsBadMan
[3:35:30] <AmuserName> SINGULARITY Kreygasm
[3:35:30] <BenLanBen> gaiara
[3:35:32] <%JoshManVGH> @aiutare47 but they are actively looking for a home planet after losing their home planet.
[3:35:33] <RushUnplugged> S I N G U L A R I T Y
[3:35:35] <+GuilKato> a fine selection - like Garrus & Wrex or Garrus & Tali, you can't go wrong
[3:35:36] <dero45> my team in ! was tali and liara or wrex
[3:35:36] <$Captainahab_37> Xtra Oxygen
[3:35:36] <%ingman112> Executive officer
[3:35:36] <+megaman_sentinel> what's the build
[3:35:39] <Vantesla> @joshmanvgh  all original spa e they owned that include settled worlds went to Geth. Also Council Races kinda don't want them. Also they need very specific ecosystems to live outside suits. They kinda screwed themselves unintentionally
[3:35:39] <%king_wragles> @Dakuu75 executive officer
[3:35:40] <heartlesshealer> oh, pat just does auto leveling
[3:35:41] <AmuserName> MORE SINGULARITY
[3:35:41] <+Daigrey> electronics for shields
[3:35:42] <James_Quivers> @Dakuu75 Hugs and kisses
[3:35:43] <%shadowsofpain> I always go for Toaster/Quarian peace myself. It feels the most complete from Legion to Tali
[3:35:43] <+even_the_yuenglings> singularity is very good
[3:35:45] <+FelIian> Executive Officer
[3:35:45] <GandhiTheTerrible> MAX SINGULARITY
[3:35:45] <thetunnelhomer> Stasis tho
[3:35:46] <%sporeian94> @Dakuu75  Executive Officer
[3:35:48] <xcompleasedad> You need to mainline abilities more.
[3:35:49] <+GingerStrawhat> But Singularity tho
[3:35:49] <Sigma_190_Beta> That's not great.
[3:35:49] <%bread_assassin> I'd move points into Singularity.
[3:35:50] <heartlesshealer> =T
[3:35:50] <Deasmeister> Singularity reall good
[3:35:53] <heartlesshealer> I guess it works
[3:35:53] <%DJFakie> Should be OK, First Aid is good cause they all stack
[3:35:54] <sgtbloopface> um
[3:35:54] <%Varlinator> Build up Singularity + Stasis
[3:35:55] <Sigma_190_Beta> Singularity needs to be higher.
[3:35:56] <asurite_warrior> @PatStaresAt Old ass RPGs make me want to play other Old ass RPGs, Gonna grab the neverwinter nights RPGs off GOG not
[3:35:56] <tanarath> LIFT
[3:35:57] <%Dakuu75> lol, thank you chat. <3
[3:35:58] <xcompleasedad> Get the powers stronger.
[3:35:58] <RedPlasticCup> looks good to me pet
[3:36:00] <dero45> u might want high electronics for hacking
[3:36:02] <Dabrikishaw> I don't put Stasis on party members
[3:36:04] <sgtbloopface> singularity best skill in the game tho
[3:36:05] <SaphronBlackbourne> That's pretty bad
[3:36:10] <+OneGorillionDollars> Start pouring points into singularity now
[3:36:11] <dero45> and decrypt
[3:36:26] <thetunnelhomer> Garrus is no longer squish
[3:36:27] <%AzureGale> Tech Armor
[3:36:29] <%logoth_> Make garrus damp
[3:36:33] <aiutare47> @JoshManVGH They arent, they want Rannoch back. Quarian culture has so ingrained the return to Rannoch that they refuse to settle any other habitable worlds, even if they could find them.
[3:36:36] <dero45> singularity so op
[3:36:43] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Do party member level individually? Or do they also level in the background? Cause I would hate if they only get XP if active.
[3:36:45] <Sigma_190_Beta> More Sniper is important.
[3:36:50] <$Captainahab_37> the sounds in this game are so good
[3:36:51] <%IamGrapes> stack Sniping Rifle on Garrus and he one shots everything in a hallway
[3:36:53] <%sporeian94> THIS ASSHOLE!
[3:36:53] <+even_the_yuenglings> oh no
[3:36:54] <QuestlordJake> this fuckn guy
[3:36:56] <dd44dostivei> garrus looks a lot better with textures
[3:36:58] <%DJFakie> @42nfl19 Everyone levels together
[3:37:01] <%immortanjoestar> is this game good?
[3:37:06] <AngryAsian5> THIS BITCH
[3:37:07] <MagmaRam> Roast his ass
[3:37:09] <viewtifulr> So how often is it that people who eat Krogen food just get ER or just pronounced dead
[3:37:09] <Jaysky> I always built into their character so I maxed sniper for Garrus
[3:37:10] <AthenaAegis> In my first play of ME1, Liara and Tali would DESTROY everything in combat. Ridiculously op lol
[3:37:12] <%Varlinator> Tell this prick to shove off
[3:37:12] <$Captainahab_37> the graphical jump from 1 to 2 made me like, shit myself back in the day
[3:37:16] <trianglehat> LUL
[3:37:18] <+even_the_yuenglings> LUL
[3:37:20] <Sp3ctre48> Oh god

[3:37:30] <dero45> @Dabrikishaw it great idk if they change it but now u actually dmg frozen ppl
[3:37:30] <Broken_Sonex> STILL not as bad as Ashley
[3:37:32] <GandhiTheTerrible> WOW
[3:37:33] <%Varlinator> Oh HI ASHLEY'S DAD!
[3:37:34] <$Faustgesicht> Hey! The third Racist! He'll grant some wishes
[3:37:36] <+flexin_apex> I always be a jerk to this guy
[3:37:36] <%IamGrapes> wow
[3:37:38] <%shadowsofpain> fuck this guy
[3:37:41] <Mattais88> Green, like all humans
[3:37:43] <dero45> another racist
[3:37:44] <%AzureGale> Throw this man out of the airlock
[3:37:44] <%JoshManVGH> @aiutare47 That gets really frustrating after 2 though. Like it's not even a Geth issue at that point.
[3:37:44] <BenLanBen> my blood is alien green sir
[3:37:45] <+NeonLight> "What a piece of junk!!"
[3:37:48] <+Totally_Not_Toby> and that's saying... a lot?
[3:37:48] <MagmaRam> TALK SHIT ON MY SHIP AND YOU CAN LEAVE IT THE SHORT WAY
[3:37:49] <%RaziWraith> Jelly of the ship, really?
[3:37:50] <%IamGrapes> I'd fuck this ship before you
[3:37:50] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Lol cry more
[3:37:51] <Vantesla> Ya this guy was an ahole. Pretty much going full paragon or renegade is only way to humble the douchebag LUL
[3:37:53] <$Captainahab_37> if you're a specter cant you just, punch this guy
[3:37:54] <%NopeBadguy> can we throw this dude out the airlock

[3:37:58] <dd44dostivei> alliance is hyper racist in me1
[3:37:59] <ahaegotrigger> its not a fighter LUL
[3:38:00] <%zyberion626> dont you DARE shit talk my ship
[3:38:00] <arkv01> this lad never had asasi booty
[3:38:01] <AngryAsian5> You're a Spectre Shepard, tell this dude to get bent.
[3:38:02] <viewtifulr> god damn there are so much space racists
[3:38:03] <SaltyAzteca> saaaaalt
[3:38:06] <Archmortal> "She's useless, that's why I'm so pissed I don't have it in my fleet"
[3:38:08] <%justcallmebobplease> How on earth does he not grasp the value of spec ops vessels, he's a high-up officer!?

[3:38:15] <+vaderxyz1970> Shes so hot my pilot will fuck it in the next couple of games
[3:38:16] <tanarath> A stealth frigate is useful!

[3:38:20] <aiutare47> @JoshManVGH yeah but its there thing. Just like the Salarians and being degenerate war criminals
[3:38:20] <%zyberion626> EVERYONE is racist in ME1
[3:38:21] <%JoshManVGH> But you wouldn't have had a Normandy which is way cooler
[3:38:21] <dero45> damn right
[3:38:22] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> shove him out the airlock
[3:38:24] <$Captainahab_37> imagine disliking the normandy

[3:38:51] <%templar010> @PatStaresAt You dont have the charm for this sadly
[3:38:55] <ketchuo13> okay, that's fair
[3:39:00] <PanicSwytch> Off topic, KOF XV got delayed for 2022
[3:39:04] <%JoshManVGH> But it's not a front line ship
[3:39:09] <Vantesla> Pretty much he had an agenda before meeting. He even admit as much if you persuade him... Political Military ahole.
[3:39:10] <%machshop> [points]

[3:39:22] <+ThomasOfTroy> You don't, that guy is right
[3:39:22] <Sigma_190_Beta> IT IS NOT A FRONTLINE SHIP! IT'S A STEALTH SHIP!
[3:39:26] <%king_wragles> @templar010 He has max charm??
[3:39:27] <%justcallmebobplease> How the fuck does an Admiral not know this?
[3:39:31] <%SvenHolgersson> No evil Space Pat?
[3:39:34] <%SvenHolgersson> Darn
[3:39:34] <%DJFakie> There's one at the end that's an endgame charm
[3:39:34] <ketchuo13> Charm is so useful
[3:39:37] <%logoth_> Its not a warship dipshit
[3:39:38] <%bread_assassin> They get more difficult.
[3:39:38] <+ghostfaceninja_> a military commander not understanding the usefullness of FUCKING STEALTH LUL
[3:39:39] <MusouMiko> this guy is goalpost moving real hard
[3:39:41] <$Captainahab_37> why would a frontline ship be capable of STEALTH
[3:39:42] <Sp3ctre48> Why would anyone want a stealth ship? BabyRage
[3:39:43] <James_Quivers> biggest ship nerd of all time
[3:39:43] <%JoshManVGH> The next one needs a beefy paragon rate I think.
[3:39:43] <peanutdot007> That's absolutely the job of proper warships
[3:39:43] <+NeonLight> KILL KILL KILL!
[3:39:44] <Essixian> MORE SPACISM

[3:39:48] <%machshop> oh great another space racist
[3:39:49] <SlippedDisco> sure we can
[3:39:49] <Sigma_190_Beta> IT IS NOT A WARSHIP IDIOT!

[3:39:51] <%AzureGale> OUT THE AIRLOCK
[3:39:52] <BlueBiscuitGT> Intel is super useful you dolt

[3:40:05] <%JoshManVGH> Well fuck me.
[3:40:06] <asurite_warrior> @PatStaresAt Being honest he has a point. If Shepard wasnt the protagonist this would not be worth it. Historically stealth ships were not known to be cost effective
[3:40:06] <dd44dostivei> TURIANS???\
[3:40:07] <Mattais88> Not quarians though, they got too thick asses to boot of a ship
[3:40:07] <+senfood> HEARTS AND MINDS
[3:40:08] <+even_the_yuenglings> JESUS
[3:40:09] <%Bluwizard21> If a single ship can disable the entire supply line of the enemy with stealth attacks I'd say that beats a big gun ship

[3:40:11] <iosephe> this fucking guy

[3:41:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, have you ever spoken to anyone in the military?
[3:41:26] <%DJFakie> That's more real than you think, Pat.
[3:41:26] <%AncelDeLambert> someone should tell the squib that ONE SHIP WILL NEVER WIN A WAR!

[3:44:22] <QuestlordJake> AGAIN BAYBEEEEE
[3:44:22] <dd44dostivei> it's an interrupt in 2
[3:44:22] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt its way more justified in 2 and 3
[3:44:25] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> Punch her again
[3:44:25] <$Captainahab_37> how is she still concious
[3:44:27] <+flexin_apex> Back to packing bags Shepard
[3:44:27] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Just like Picard would’ve done woolieFABRICATION

[3:44:27] <Vantesla> Glass him was more clear if you knew the lingo LUL
[3:44:29] <%Dakuu75> i like how he goes back to hist standing spot, like an RPG turn based battle
[3:44:30] <nuane> why did he even do that, the questions were fine?
[3:44:31] <Lamokmok> Will you just keep punching her?
[3:44:32] <$Captainahab_37> his arm is covered in armor
[3:44:33] <+Daigrey> this girl and her fucking Star Wars camera

[3:44:37] <asurite_warrior> Like Why? she did even say anything accusatory
[3:44:38] <Dunmarkh> @dekkitout she learns to dodge after the second punch
[3:44:38] <%AncelDeLambert> it's pretty cool, my dick is super huge now
[3:44:39] <KeiPrime> be nice THEN punch her
[3:44:39] <+even_the_yuenglings> they do it better in the other games
[3:44:39] <%Dehlome> say all the blue things then punch her anyways @PatStaresAt
[3:44:40] <arkv01> the best, huh...
[3:44:45] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> The first time I played this game I didn't know that was going to happen and I had to live with that, because I had spent maybe an hour looking for all of those keepers
[3:44:52] <dero45> she ate that punch tbh seeing how everyone else takes a sheperd right
[3:44:53] <%Ravioli_Ronin> psaFist psaFist psaFist psaFist psaFist psaFist psaFist psaFist
[3:45:00] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> I’d punch her again
[3:45:10] <ape_hawk> AXUALLY
[3:45:15] <+Ropcord> if you never punch her in the first 2 and do it in 3 she still ducks, implying shepard isn't the only one doing it
[3:45:16] <$Captainahab_37> in that save is a reality where she lives a loop of being decked
[3:45:21] <%justcallmebobplease> Did Shephard just ACHTUALLY?
[3:45:22] <%AncelDeLambert> ... isn't it even being a joint effort classified?
[3:45:25] <Essixian> SHE IS SUCH A SNAKE OH MY GOD

[3:46:29] <viewtifulr> Professional Pat
[3:46:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> I love how, in this situation, she is just a LITTLE snide and passive aggressive.
[3:46:30] <asurite_warrior> @PatStaresAt You know being fair there was a massive war before the begining of their war between turians and humans that seemed to almost wipe out the Earth. It makes sense that human would dislike aliens
[3:46:31] <JetpackMcQuack> Imma good boy
[3:46:31] <Archmortal> nah the real answer is totally talkin' shit about Saren.  It makes the Council mad
[3:46:31] <+robosqueeb> She looks like one of those hairless chihuahuas

[3:46:35] <%wibbwobbler> doodWat

[3:46:39] <arkv01> just fist right up her ass cmon just one
[3:46:39] <$Captainahab_37> i said "council are BITCHES"
[3:46:39] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> I like how punching her was NOT a renegade option, just a regular one
[3:46:41] <Erdrick117> Shoot her!
[3:46:41] <dero45> lol
[3:46:43] <$Captainahab_37> ay yo FUCK the council

[3:46:59] <Archmortal> You do NOT wanna buy shit from shops for a whiiiiile
[3:47:00] <+titansloth93> I know they had a lot of characters to model, but it's hilarious how many women have the exact same hair/body type
[3:47:02] <%DJFakie> License, that's it
[3:47:04] <Vantesla> I will say she takes a good punch. In 3 she even ducks one LUL
[3:47:06] <DSD24> No its trash
[3:47:07] <%ScottishMadJacko> just play and loot
[3:47:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> You are.
[3:47:10] <aiutare47> Its all late game
[3:47:14] <heartlesshealer> Pat, Garrus can have Medium Armor now, set him UP
[3:47:15] <+Daigrey> not till endgame
[3:47:16] <+even_the_yuenglings> theres so much loot theres no reason
[3:47:16] <%DJFakie> Buy licenses and med upgrades, get all gear from drops
[3:47:17] <Psyramics> better shit will drop
[3:47:18] <Alzero83> Loot will always be better
[3:47:20] <dashmatt> You pick up stuff all the time
[3:47:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Just play video game
[3:47:21] <%BigCoffee> Just get the license
[3:47:21] <aiutare47> Shops only have good stuff towards the end of the game
[3:47:22] <%W1nterTitan> yeah
[3:47:22] <tanarath> @patstaresat none but the best licenses
[3:47:24] <%barristerofthebar> !uptime
[3:47:24] <@Moobot> @barristerofthebar I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 47m.
[3:47:24] <%Monkeyweed21> you just save up for the spectre stuff
[3:47:24] <%ScottishMadJacko> you'll find huge amounts of shit
[3:47:25] <JetpackMcQuack> It all sucks
[3:47:25] <+ThomasOfTroy> Buy nothing but the specter gear
[3:47:28] <+FelIian> you get a LOT of trash
[3:47:30] <%strugglepunk2> Just hoard money for spectre master gear
[3:47:32] <+Daigrey> special shit at endgame in shop
[3:47:36] <DiabeticCat> Only buy the spectre gear tbh
[3:47:37] <%strugglepunk2> and upgrades and licsences
[3:47:38] <mar_krow> They level up later
[3:47:39] <+even_the_yuenglings> buy upgrades but thats it
[3:47:41] <AthenaAegis> Yeah, it's pretty much better to loot than buy in ME1
[3:47:41] <%Monkeyweed21> Until the Specter gear yea
[3:47:41] <dd44dostivei> loot is always better, except for spectre gear
[3:47:42] <%ingman112> The only stuff you should buy are the licenses. The equipment you find on missions scales and is good enough
[3:47:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> Only buy Spectre Gear.
[3:47:43] <42nfl19> Is it like most RPGs where you get good loot randomly while playing instead of buying stuff? @PatStaresAt
[3:47:43] <dero45> yea shes just pistols
[3:47:43] <heartlesshealer> get licenses to use the crap you pick up off the floor
[3:47:44] <arkv01> yeah commander hobo shepard
[3:47:44] <%ScottishMadJacko> liara has no weapon training
[3:47:44] <Archmortal> Loot will be better until you get the Licenses that cost 30k, that's when good gear starts showing up in shops
[3:47:47] <Deasmeister> Specter stuff is the only worth it thing
[3:47:48] <$Captainahab_37> loot is cool and all but consuming product is nice too!
[3:47:48] <%templar010> @PatStaresAt The Spectre stuff appears after virmire at level VII., When you are at the equivalent of 55 and with at leat 1 million credits you can buy level X
[3:47:49] <+brandonsbetow> you have to get like, a million credits to buy spectre gear
[3:47:50] <Essixian> *Shepard walks into the requisitions office, dumps a box of credits on the desk, and just screams "GUNS GUNS GUNS"*
[3:47:53] <Vantesla> Is the Remaster still have possible bug with Spectre Gear not showing once unlocked/level?
[3:47:56] <dd44dostivei> get cheap upgrades
[3:47:57] <+brandonsbetow> like in your wallet
[3:47:58] <%shadowsofpain> buy licenses and med upgrades other than that save for Specter stuff
[3:47:58] <+Ropcord> only buy cool looking armor so you aren't stuck in a neon orange shell for half the game
[3:47:58] <+brandonsbetow> at once
[3:48:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Elevator Time
[3:48:08] <%W1nterTitan> There's one or two high priced armors that are better than normal loot.
[3:48:10] <+brandonsbetow> thats ME!
[3:48:12] <Archmortal> @templar010 Virmire is for tier X
[3:48:16] <+brandonsbetow> not legendary
[3:48:18] <%ScottishMadJacko> yeah, spectre gear is one of the only items worth anything
[3:48:19] <dd44dostivei> that's for max spectre gear
[3:48:23] <+FelIian> @PatStaresAt if you press in Right Stick on a piece of equipment you will mark it as junk, so you can sell all junk at the same time
[3:48:23] <$hattrick61> yeah it do
[3:48:24] <+PenmanLupine> upgrade your companions armor so a stiff breeze doesn't kill them immediately
[3:48:25] <%DJFakie> Spectre X costs around 6 million but by that time you should be capped on money
[3:48:26] <DSD24> Yeah its just to pick up Blue Lady
[3:48:28] <%strugglepunk2> Nah only unlock for Spectre X gear is getting locked down in the pre-endgame
[3:48:30] <AmuserName> It does though? You get new sidequests.
[3:48:30] <+spartanghost004> It unlocks a bunch of side quests
[3:48:30] <+shapeforn> ya know, I didn't like me2 gear very much, Andromeda kinda got that right, even if it was a shitfire
[3:48:33] <%Varlinator> It's like a baby main mission
[3:48:34] <Ultimatefool> Pat-Shepard freaks me out, not sure why
[3:48:40] <%ingman112> You sure? I think it does
[3:48:40] <%Bluwizard21> laser corridor
[3:48:42] <%Dakuu75> look at this RE movie hallway
[3:48:47] <+megaman_sentinel> that cameraman suck at his job
[3:48:49] <$Captainahab_37> did andromeda have anything going for it at all in the slightest
[3:48:50] <%BigCoffee> cant you sell them?
[3:48:51] <%strugglepunk2> Spectre X gear generally drops for like 1.2mil
[3:48:51] <%Bluwizard21> re or metal gear laser corridor
[3:48:52] <%DJFakie> You can omni all garbage
[3:48:55] <aiutare47> @Ultimatefool Its the overwhelming aura of a creepy uncle
[3:48:56] <%DJFakie> Yes
[3:48:57] <zachpaladin> Is the really rediculous early pistol still in the game?
[3:48:57] <%ScottishMadJacko> it's easy enough to max out credits anyway thougb
[3:48:57] <dashmatt> yes
[3:48:58] <%strugglepunk2> nah sell it
[3:48:58] <Archmortal> yes
[3:48:58] <%dekkitout> Gel gel gel
[3:48:58] <+spartanghost004> also if you bring tali and garrus on here you get to hear racist garrus
[3:48:59] <+Daigrey> yes
[3:49:01] <tanarath> YES
[3:49:01] <wolfen091> why gief no bark with gun point now?
[3:49:02] <viewtifulr> Oh pat, whould you rather live on a station or colonized planet? lytHI
[3:49:03] <%twistedj3ster> Omni Gel Ashley
[3:49:05] <+Vijuani> ye
[3:49:08] <Archmortal> Selling it is only worth it at like tier IV and above
[3:49:09] <FennecZephyr> Onigel low level crap
[3:49:10] <%ScottishMadJacko> yeah, early gear is worth shit for credits
[3:49:14] <FennecZephyr> Sell anything above rank 5
[3:49:16] <%DJFakie> Omni all low level, sell high level
[3:49:22] <Vantesla> If I recall one dev on Remaster said ME1 should be possible to max level in one playthrough now if you do pretty much everything available
[3:49:32] <Mattais88> nassicaa dantalleus too
[3:49:34] <+spartanghost004> your big huff and puff
[3:49:35] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Set up Garrus and Michele on a date!!
[3:49:43] <%Dakuu75> she looks like a Grandma
[3:49:53] <%Monkeyweed21> thank me with your mouth
[3:49:55] <$Faustgesicht> Ooof she got hit with a stick
[3:49:56] <DSD24> French people exist Pat
[3:50:02] <+Daigrey> No way the french made it to space
[3:50:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Why are you French?" Everyone who joins this stream.
[3:50:05] <$Captainahab_37> i used to watch the flying cars a lot
[3:50:12] <Laecerelius> PAAAAT!  You can't just ask someone why they're French!
[3:50:13] <+CursedNobleman> is this leilana? LUL
[3:50:16] <Mattais88> anti chakwas
[3:50:16] <$Captainahab_37> they LET the french into space
[3:50:16] <DSD24> Its probably Neo France like in G Gundam
[3:50:18] <%DJFakie> These are good, health regen is important
[3:50:19] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Imagine thinking that the french could go to space
[3:50:19] <%AncelDeLambert> God, Yahtzee Croshaw is so fucking right about the faces, it's like I'm talking to a fish
[3:50:22] <+spartanghost004> I love this game so much
[3:50:24] <aiutare47> those are great
[3:50:25] <Psyramics> health regen is good
[3:50:26] <%Dakuu75> oh man, I thought she was selling Loot Boxes for a second there
[3:50:31] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> Space French
[3:50:34] <%DJFakie> Health regeneration, super important
[3:50:35] <dashmatt> armor add ons
[3:50:36] <%ScottishMadJacko> armour upgrades
[3:50:37] <Psyramics> armor mods?
[3:50:38] <Botman_R> Armor mods
[3:50:38] <$hattrick61> armor upgrade
[3:50:39] <aiutare47> They are armor upgrades, pretty handy ones
[3:50:40] <Mattais88> health regen i think
[3:50:41] <+CursedNobleman> @DSD24 PogChamp what about the statue of liberty cannon
[3:50:41] <$Faustgesicht> Armor Upgrades
[3:50:42] <%Treuan> armor upgrades
[3:50:45] <zachpaladin> Really happy to see Pat playing ME
[3:50:46] <Archmortal> The Doctor's store is static, permanently
[3:50:48] <$lotharrio> Yeah, REGEN!
[3:50:51] <$Captainahab_37> @AncelDeLambert I think you mean a frog
[3:50:52] <GrooovinMagic> She's just a Ouiaboo.
[3:50:57] <tanarath> @patstaresat michelle is the best place to sell in the game, ONLY SELL TO HER
[3:50:57] <Psyramics> buy and use these
[3:50:58] <%sporeian94> none
[3:51:00] <AmuserName> Yeah, medical Interfaces are great late-game.
[3:51:02] <aiutare47> I usually use these
[3:51:02] <%DJFakie> Buy 2+3
[3:51:02] <Psyramics> no, get good ones
[3:51:04] <+Daigrey> none
[3:51:05] <+spartanghost004> sure why not
[3:51:08] <DSD24> @CursedNobleman That was pretty hype not gonna lie
[3:51:11] <Archmortal> but when you complete her sidequest, she gives you like 50% or double what anyone else gives you if you sell shit to her
[3:51:12] <%twistedj3ster> 3
[3:51:14] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Get the best ones you can buy
[3:51:17] <%templar010> @PatStaresAt Other people were right, level VII spectre stuff is available once you hit a million credits. Just stick to drops; you get tons of mods from side mission chests
[3:51:17] <%ScottishMadJacko> low level is shit, you'll never regen a decent amount of health
[3:51:18] <+brandonsbetow> get good opnes that don't break bank
[3:51:21] <+Daigrey> you can find this shit
[3:51:22] <Archmortal> 50% extra that is
[3:51:23] <Psyramics> you only need one, everyone can watch you kickass from the floor
[3:51:23] <%AncelDeLambert> mitigation is probably better right now than regen
[3:51:24] <$lotharrio> Any amount of regen is useful for preserving medipacks.
[3:51:25] <%DJFakie> 2+3, give one to someone else
[3:51:29] <%ingman112> Maybe wait on these
[3:51:36] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Wait, can't you get a discount from her later on?
[3:51:37] <GandhiTheTerrible> save monies for now
[3:51:41] <Vantesla> The Remaster did somehow make many faces look worse. Not just in ME1, but a couple in 2&3.... I doubt they will be fixed. So if want less bleh faces gotta play originals...
[3:51:47] <%DJFakie> A party of Ashley and Kaiden has unique dialogue here
[3:51:47] <aiutare47> tox resist and health regen help a lot with longer fights, especially on the harder difficulties
[3:51:50] <+Fooguwu> @Captainahab_37 FYI pat will sometimes ban for that "light" slur
[3:51:57] <DSD24> Kelly looks off in ME2
[3:52:02] <%Undenizen> man, exploring the citadel was the BEST. Why did they get rid of it?
[3:52:07] <DSD24> Aww yeah Keepers
[3:52:09] <tanarath> @plaidisthenewplaid yes, best place to sell stuff in the whole game
[3:52:10] <BlueBiscuitGT> Ah the "Thugs on Da Floor" room, so nostalgic
[3:52:27] <+SinnerEbru> does the citadel BGM sound crazy sometimes for anyone else
[3:52:27] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Fuck palace flux
[3:52:28] <Alzero83> Breath with your nose when you run, Pat
[3:52:32] <Alzero83> Kappa
[3:52:36] <DSD24> Oh cool Pat's a Earthborn
[3:52:37] <Vantesla> @dsd24 Supposedly they changed her to the ME3 model, but changed the ME3 model as well...
[3:52:40] <$Captainahab_37> Keepers are weird
[3:52:41] <%sporeian94> SHEPARD WAS A BLOOD ON EARTH
[3:52:43] <%BigCoffee> wow what a loser
[3:52:44] <%Ranryu692> Tunnel Snakes Rule!
[3:52:50] <%MidnightBurst12> erf

[3:53:00] <%Dakuu75> go for it, dude
[3:53:04] <James_Quivers> WE'RE THE TUNNEL SANKES
[3:53:11] <%JoshManVGH> Punch this man!
[3:53:12] <+NeonLight> Blackmailing a spectre, bold move
[3:53:15] <%AncelDeLambert> well, "for old time's sake" go get bent
[3:53:17] <DSD24> @Vantesla She kinda does like the Blonde version of her in ME3 so I see it
[3:53:20] <%Ranryu692> TUNNEL SNAKES RULE
[3:53:22] <%SirGO0SE> Punch should always be an option
[3:53:22] <AngryAsian5> This man's a snitch
[3:53:23] <JetpackMcQuack> I ran that shit go ahead
[3:53:23] <DSD24> Blue Magic?

[3:53:46] <@Moobot> @JudgeParadox I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 54m.
[3:53:53] <DSD24> Was Red Ice in Deadly Premonition ?
[3:53:54] <JetpackMcQuack> Punch and walk away should be dedicated buttons
[3:53:59] <%SirGO0SE> importer exporters?
[3:54:03] <+Daigrey> Red sand feels like a cowboy bebop reference
[3:54:04] <DSD24> No that was Red Seeds!
[3:54:04] <%Puhff> Wow I have never seen this npc
[3:54:05] <Alzero83> The Drugs are RED, the Asari are BLUE and the money is GREEN
[3:54:06] <%Dakuu75> they sound like space pirates and drug dealers
[3:54:07] <$Captainahab_37> would you guys do space drugs?
[3:54:09] <JudgeParadox> fuck that guy
[3:54:14] <Vantesla> @dsd24 I get some reasoning, just in my opinion ME3 made some faces worse even in original.
[3:54:17] <+chestertonfencer> That's the voice of a trustworthy man
[3:54:18] <+yoshkosh20> you didn't punch the reporter. punch that dude instead.
[3:54:19] <+BIumen> @DSD24 Detroit. DP was the Seeds
[3:54:20] <Mattais88> we're gonna screw him over, right?
[3:54:21] <%BigCoffee> @Captainahab_37 yes
[3:54:21] <%AncelDeLambert> "talking" in this case translating into: "lemme read his wrap-sheet"
[3:54:31] <+D00msDayDan> @Alzero83 i choose the money ending

[3:55:28] <Vantesla> If I recall the Gang Shepard was part of on Earth was ok for a gang. Till it started getting xenophobic and more violent. Shepard left prior to join military if recall.
[3:55:31] <%AzureGale> wtf
[3:55:34] <%BigCoffee> the Asari dancer in the back makes it the best
[3:55:40] <Mattais88> right as a stripper goes in the background
[3:55:41] <%king_wragles> The stripper in the background sells the gravity of the situation
[3:55:42] <Alzero83> especially Talis bed
[3:55:42] <Blank9> I'm not in bed with anyone, I'm a virgin
[3:55:48] <%BigCoffee> that was.....easy
[3:55:48] <%JoshManVGH> Arguing in front of the stripper seems like a mood killer.
[3:55:48] <+yoshkosh20> Jokes on you. Uncle shep is into that shit.

[4:12:48] <ioci2112> shepard is a highly trained spectre and alliance commando, but aparently military training doesn't include running more than 10 meters
[4:12:50] <Vantesla> The couple I remember. had to do with the baby and a rare disease. Choosing to get an experimental cure or not.

[4:17:40] <ScreamLord> I wonder if Conrad is still bugged to to appear in ME2 and act like you were a dick to him?
[4:17:45] <%Lion_kun> Hey Pat, I know I shouldn't have bought the PS5 from a scalper but I was very frustrated after being screwed over by my retailer twice and I didn't want to wait anymore especially with the new exclusives coming out. I know I was ripped off but I am having so much fun in Des with a faith/magic hybrid build I don't care, the PS5 feels so good to play, that haptic feedback is for real.

[4:19:05] <%scaryboisupreme> Thanks Bishop
[4:19:09] <+redthebaron> it is wild that they don't have chairs in this room in space
[4:19:09] <+RahuHordika> hackett my man
[4:19:10] <DSD24> Man I love the Normandy music
[4:19:11] <Alzero83> Why does Hackett get to call the shots, He aint a spectre
[4:19:12] <%hrbeck_> You did deck her
[4:19:12] <JetpackMcQuack> Public opinion go up
[4:19:13] <%shurtal> Hackett's the BEST
[4:19:14] <thetruenicster> Thanks Lance Hendrickson
[4:19:14] <Dunmarkh> @Punchasaur amy rose blussy
[4:19:16] <AngryAsian5> Lance Henrickson is mah dude!
[4:19:20] <Vantesla> That is the vice of Lance Hendrickson!
[4:19:22] <+SynnerGee> but he just had treats!
[4:19:23] <ThatGuyThere03> @Ravioli_Ronin I just think it's funnier that way, because it implies that he always wears a hat
[4:19:23] <asurite_warrior> @PatStaresAt Being fair those were a 1 on 50 chance and a 1 in 300 chance. Vaccines are a 1 in a million chance for a minor adverse effect
[4:19:24] <%walternatorz> the treats aren't enough
[4:19:26] <$Captainahab_37> the galactic map music is so fucking good
[4:19:30] <Vantesla> voice... ironmouseSTARE
[4:19:30] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> You dabbed on her SO hard Commander. Good job, Hackett out.
[4:19:31] <%BigCoffee> @ScreamLord it would depends on how you are with the treatment
[4:19:32] <+TheBitingIrish> ewwwww
[4:19:33] <Wolfstriker121> lance is still alive right?
[4:19:35] <$Captainahab_37> my dog fucking LOVES cat shit
[4:19:39] <%AncelDeLambert> animals are gross
[4:19:39] <FishSkeleton> Hey, Pat, longtime fan.  I don't know if off-topic questions are alright, but if they are, how do you feel about the current mass WoW exodus taking place?  WoW streamers and content creators are jumping ship for FFXIV left and right due to the WoW content drought and the devs telling players they're wrong to not like homework systems.  I swapped from WoW myself a week ago and am currently now a level 51 Dragoon, having fun with it.
[4:19:40] <%dekkitout> Dope- wait.. not dope!
[4:19:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Feeding Zangief only made him HUNGRIER
[4:19:42] <Mattais88> Must consume all
[4:19:43] <heartlesshealer> .....
[4:19:44] <ScreamLord> Now he's infected with Elmo SPores
[4:19:44] <+MisterAvry> "but father, what if its food?"
[4:19:44] <MagmaRam> we don't know how severe the adverse effects of gene therapy would be
[4:19:51] <%king_wragles> Have you considered that Elmo's hair is delicious? I mean, even you had some
[4:19:52] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Elmo must be delicious
[4:19:56] <%walternatorz> Pat, I'm concerned that he has ingested too many elmo spores. He must be at critical elmo now
[4:20:01] <capjordo> Just 100% Andromeda, why does everybody hate it?
[4:20:03] <%hrbeck_> Elmo has tasty hair- we know this
[4:20:04] <$lotharrio> But Pat, Elmo loves himself, that's why he wants to eat everything his body produces!
[4:20:21] <Goraka91> @FishSkeleton Ah enjoy Heavensward my man
[4:20:21] <Hillthugsta> I never found a legit reason to wanna punch that reporter other than shits and giggles
[4:20:28] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @capjordo It's garbage
[4:20:31] <kifflomdolphin> @capjordo Because everyone in Andromeda's face is tired.
[4:20:37] <asurite_warrior> Andromeda isnt the worst game in the world but it is the worst mass effect game
[4:20:38] <+MisterAvry> he's looking at ghosts
[4:20:40] <James_Quivers> @PatStaresAtIf humanity only joined this society 30 years ago, while are all these ancient systems and star clusters named after human cutural artifacts?
[4:20:44] <$Captainahab_37> i punch the reporter cause the animation is fuckin great
[4:20:44] <%Lion_kun> Lion_kun subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 41 months! Hey Pat, just wanna say I know I was ripped off buying that PS5 but I am having so much fun playing Des, I don't care, I made a faith/magic hybrid build and it feels so good, that haptic feedback is for real.
[4:20:54] <Vantesla> Lance actually had voiced many Bioware games outside Mass Effect. He is in the SWTOR MMO. Also I think one of Dragon Ages, but can't recall LUL
[4:20:54] <%walternatorz> he's riding a treat high
[4:20:57] <%Dakuu75> all that treat-chewing is exhausting
[4:20:58] <%afronooch> Andromeda is bad mass effect, but meh game
[4:21:13] <Hillthugsta> @asurite_warrior The combat is the one redeeming feature
[4:21:14] <%BigCoffee> you're encouraging scalpers, you're part of the problem
[4:21:17] <MagmaRam> @James_Quivers these are their names in whatever the dominant human language is (English, probably?), presumably aliens have their own names in their own language
[4:21:20] <+Punchasaur> @lotharrio zangief is the one eating the hair
[4:21:21] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @James_Quivers That's the Alliance name for them? Human navigation system?
[4:21:24] <capjordo> I love them all but I thought andromeda was refreshing and it also has enough tie-ins with these games for the loyal fans
[4:21:27] <$Captainahab_37> i just dont like new bioware's writing
[4:21:28] <%W1nterTitan> gas gas
[4:21:29] <%Ranryu692> is it fart gas?
[4:21:30] <ioci2112> it's pat's bathroom
[4:21:31] <+Daigrey> need to harvest these farts
[4:21:33] <$Captainahab_37> inquisition was just weird idk
[4:21:34] <%SirGO0SE> jermaGrin GAS
[4:21:35] <HiggsV> WENS FART GAS PLANET
[4:21:36] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Arglebargle
[4:21:38] <%blutzwavedave> NERVE AGENT
[4:21:40] <FishSkeleton> @Goraka91 I'm looking forward to it!  I just dealt with Ramuh for the first time earlier today, still working on the post-ARR content and enjoying it.
[4:21:43] <Jaysky> GAS
[4:21:44] <%twistedj3ster> Did you find that out by sending down a probe?
[4:21:47] <asurite_warrior> The Idea I get is ME3 is the man who shits himself at the end of a marathon and andromeda is the man that shits himself at the begining
[4:21:48] <$Captainahab_37> i cant tell you a single thing that happens in inquisition and i beat it 2 times
[4:21:52] <DSD24> I like this song
[4:21:53] <Goraka91> @Captainahab_37 It's very...I don't know, ''twitter?''
[4:22:01] <FightningX> Why are all the humans minus James so fucking boring?
[4:22:01] <SlippedDisco> the only teammates
[4:22:01] <+MisterAvry> All planets are fart gas planets if you eat enough beans and corn
[4:22:02] <ARobotFromtheFuture1> jermaGrin GYAS
[4:22:06] <%Daxalog> Thats Fair
[4:22:06] <%Mekhet09> But what about kaiden.
[4:22:08] <DSD24> There was that cool party in Inquisition
[4:22:12] <%Mekhet09> I mean fuck it's not kaiden is it.
[4:22:12] <Mattais88> Thesher?
[4:22:12] <%scaryboisupreme> Mass Effect 2 it's a lot harder to pick teammates imo
[4:22:14] <Vantesla> Current Bioware is just EA. All original staff of Bioware that help create Bioware are long gone...
[4:22:15] <$Captainahab_37> @Goraka91 it just doesnt flow right to me
[4:22:19] <+TheBitingIrish> @asurite_warrior But do they finish the marathon?
[4:22:23] <$Captainahab_37> like idk its not how people talk
[4:22:24] <asurite_warrior> @PatStaresAt Jack is really the first human character I like. Miranda grows on me
[4:22:24] <%shurtal> use the boost to get through!
[4:22:25] <%Dakuu75> this music is SO ratchet & clank it hurts... so-good~
[4:22:27] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> OH yeah!
[4:22:28] <Goraka91> @FishSkeleton Takes a bit but the end of ARR is when it sunk it's claws in LUL
[4:22:29] <%Grimlockfly> holy shit
[4:22:30] <xcompleasedad> The original was SHIT
[4:22:33] <%Daxalog> I never noticed how funky the music was in this game
[4:22:33] <%Grimlockfly> that does look good
[4:22:34] <LunarRemix> It still controls like shit tho
[4:22:36] <theshillman> awww yeah, mako time
[4:22:37] <capjordo> @asurite_warrior  fair point lmao
[4:22:39] <James_Quivers> The stretched textures were laughable even back then
[4:22:41] <%ArCielArDor> It looked like you were driving on God's turd
[4:22:42] <Mattais88> not one texture anymore
[4:22:44] <+D00msDayDan> still looks boring as shit though
[4:22:46] <Hillthugsta> Kaiden got better by the 3rd game
[4:22:47] <capjordo> That plus daddy issues
[4:22:47] <%Monkeyweed21> its not eye searing orange and green
[4:22:49] <Profmcstevie> Oh I saw it plenty of times, it looked real.....I wanna say Steam asset flippy
[4:22:55] <+MisterAvry> the skyboxes were still good in the original
[4:22:55] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> These still aren't great, but better than they were
[4:22:56] <%Daxalog> Do you think Advent Rising will ever get a remaster?
[4:23:02] <%scaryboisupreme> wait there's a boost???? I went through this whole remaster without knowing that
[4:23:06] <%walternatorz> what? just throwing a single texture across the entire surface wasn't enough?
[4:23:06] <JetpackMcQuack> Most planets are shit
[4:23:08] <AmuserName> Bonus loot PogChamp
[4:23:09] <+Punchasaur> The only people who pick liara are the ones who wanna fuck sonic
[4:23:09] <Psyramics> I wish these planets were procedural, holy shit that would be cool
[4:23:09] <+NeonLight> tbf, most planets would be boring as shit
[4:23:10] <+flexin_apex> They all look better now
[4:23:12] <+CookieCutter007> make me suffer
[4:23:13] <asurite_warrior> No because Andromeda left some cliff hangers
[4:23:14] <%RaziWraith> but now it's GOOD LOOKING boring piece of shit
[4:23:15] <%Monkeyweed21> god the color of orange they used for the planets damaged my eyes
[4:23:15] <$renegade_blade> I like how in me1 each party member represents one of the 6 classes
[4:23:17] <$Captainahab_37> planets are boring pieces of shit yeah
[4:23:21] <%Dakuu75> @scaryboisupreme oh you poor thing. lol
[4:23:23] <+F0u1Play> when I first played this I did not know you could use the map until late game
[4:23:28] <dd44dostivei> mars looks like shit
[4:23:29] <ammobasket> Guess what most planets look like
[4:23:31] <theshillman> amazing
[4:23:33] <Goraka91> @walternatorz Doesn't matter if you cover it all in bloom
[4:23:34] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> You could tell it was the first kind of game like this made by a purely traditional rpg company. It's ok.
[4:23:42] <MagmaRam> What the fuck, the Mako doesn't jump anymore?
[4:23:47] <%dekkitout> Skyriming up a mountain, eh?
[4:23:48] <MagmaRam> OH SHIT IT STILL DOES
[4:23:51] <Hillthugsta> The writers Did Kelly dirty
[4:23:54] <+redthebaron> doing stunts
[4:23:55] <%templar010> Night and day
[4:23:58] <dragon_ab> Happy Birthday Zangief PartyHat
[4:24:01] <MagmaRam> I don't want the Mako to play better.
[4:24:03] <+CookieCutter007> OH SHIT SKYRIM HORSE
[4:24:06] <$Captainahab_37> is "way better" good tho?
[4:24:10] <%templar010> HACK THE PLANET
[4:24:11] <MagmaRam> isn't thorium radioactive
[4:24:11] <James_Quivers> hack the minerals
[4:24:12] <%RaziWraith> hack the thorium LUL
[4:24:13] <JonKhan> It Frogger
[4:24:14] <%ONotation> Hack the mineral deposit
[4:24:15] <%walternatorz> you gotta hack the thorium
[4:24:16] <Goraka91> Hack that...thorium, yeah
[4:24:17] <%W1nterTitan> The MAKO doesn't handle like a drunk mountain goat anymore
[4:24:17] <+KingRipoff1> thorium not thorian
[4:24:19] <%Monkeyweed21> even Earth is like 90% boring nothingness
[4:24:19] <%Rumbutt> YOU SURE HACKED THAT ROCK REAL GOOD
[4:24:21] <+Daigrey> yeah, he should pick up a big stupid pickaxe
[4:24:21] <dd44dostivei> just hold up
[4:24:21] <%twistedj3ster> Yeah, should've just sent down a probe
[4:24:24] <+senfood> ...Did you just hack a boulder?
[4:24:29] <Hillthugsta> The Mako has shitty jumps
[4:24:29] <capjordo> Plus Andromeda had best cover shooter mechanics imo
[4:24:31] <asurite_warrior> I miss all the equipment management that ME1 has. I understand why its gone but I miss it all the same
[4:24:34] <%Dakuu75> Did you just play a hacking mini-game on the rock? wtf. lol
[4:24:36] <ScreamLord> Andromeda had potential. If only it wasn't so buggy at launch and the writing was better.
[4:24:39] <+MisterAvry> unlock the rock
[4:24:44] <$lotharrio> You'd go fully insane.
[4:24:47] <+Nephilim895> please roll the mako
[4:24:49] <ScreamLord> Combat was cool tho
[4:24:53] <capjordo> It is really buggy lmao
[4:24:55] <theshillman> mako gang mako gang
[4:24:59] <%Monkeyweed21> but why tho
[4:25:02] <AmuserName> I've done all the side missions FIRST, can confirm.
[4:25:02] <$Captainahab_37> new bioware character design also is just, idk rough to look at
[4:25:04] <%dekkitout> RPG Rule #2 - Always stock up on side quests
[4:25:06] <James_Quivers> But they're totally worth the extra 5 lines of dialogue they give you in ME3
[4:25:08] <FutureFranklinRichards> Most of them carry nothing into the future games.
[4:25:12] <$Captainahab_37> its like their eyes dont belong in their head
[4:25:13] <%W1nterTitan> you have to try to not roll it to roll it
[4:25:13] <%bread_assassin> I would've expected Past Pat to do all the side quests immediately.
[4:25:15] <+Punchasaur> Earth is 66% cool fish
[4:25:19] <Vantesla> The Moon one should be done early on a fresh game in my opinion LUL
[4:25:21] <ahaegotrigger> the moon one does
[4:25:33] <Hillthugsta> @screamlord Combat was the best on franchise
[4:25:35] <Goraka91> @Captainahab_37 You don't like every Asari in Andromeda having the exact same face?
[4:25:37] <%Taisuru> Pat you've given him so many treats he's gonna blow
[4:25:38] <+MisterAvry> bummer
[4:25:38] <%templar010> @PatStaresAt If you can flip it down a mountain you slide super fast, its hilarious
[4:25:38] <+SynnerGee> pugA
[4:25:39] <AShinyVagikarp> LUL
[4:25:39] <%ingman112> The Cerberus ones are cool
[4:25:41] <heartlesshealer> I hated so much that there were lots of invisible walls on these empty nothing planets
[4:25:41] <dashmatt> huh
[4:25:43] <%dekkitout> D:
[4:25:44] <AmuserName> Dreams and hopes: SHATTERED
[4:25:45] <%Daxalog> k
[4:25:46] <%Monkeyweed21> LUL
[4:25:46] <%templar010> NO TALI
[4:25:47] <FutureFranklinRichards> Hah.
[4:25:47] <+sermittens> @PatStaresAt Do you prefer me1 exploration with the mako or ME2-3
[4:25:50] <Zantetzuken> well
[4:25:51] <+MisterAvry> not good enough at beep boop
[4:25:53] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[4:25:54] <%Rumbutt> and that's why you level electronics oroLUL
[4:25:56] <tanarath> Requires better shit
[4:25:58] <%Monkeyweed21> YOU FORGOT THE TALI
[4:25:59] <FutureFranklinRichards> This is why Tali  is on every mission.
[4:26:01] <Vantesla> LUL
[4:26:04] <$Captainahab_37> i wonder how rare it'd be to actually find grass on a planet at all
[4:26:05] <%Dakuu75> Pat: "This has never happened to me before"
[4:26:05] <$lotharrio> ...Garrus how do you see out of that?
[4:26:08] <%W1nterTitan> time to swap Tali in.
[4:26:10] <%templar010> Same
[4:26:12] <heartlesshealer> Garrus has Decryption, not Electronics
[4:26:15] <capjordo> But PeeBee 🥺
[4:26:19] <+PenmanLupine> need Tali
[4:26:20] <%Monkeyweed21> THIS IS WHY YOU ONLY LEVEL SUPPORT SKILLS FOR YOUR PARTY MEMBERS
[4:26:20] <%Taisuru> Squad
[4:26:21] <tanarath> THIS IS WHY ELECTRONICS & DECRYPTION ARE GOOD
[4:26:23] <%W1nterTitan> You have to go up and come back down
[4:26:25] <Alzero83> Tali is the best after all
[4:26:26] <heartlesshealer> is that also why you don't give armor to Tali?
[4:26:29] <%MrBorisMakarov> return to Normandy and re land?
[4:26:30] <+MillionStabz> Uh ohhh, Tali best girl confirmed AGAIN
[4:26:31] <theshillman> because tali is best girl
[4:26:32] <+MisterAvry> "I swear this never happens to me!"
[4:26:32] <ioci2112> gotta return to the normandy and come back down
[4:26:33] <TechnicalCultist> happy birthday to the fat boi
[4:26:33] <%scaryboisupreme> What about PeeBee
[4:26:34] <%ingman112> Kaidan could do it :P
[4:26:36] <+Punchasaur> This is why tali > a liar
[4:26:39] <bluespams7> Talk is mandatory
[4:26:42] <$Captainahab_37> this is basically Xenoblade Chronicles X
[4:26:43] <bluespams7> Tali
[4:26:44] <Vantesla> Never had such problems given I play a lot of Sentinel ironmouseKEK
[4:26:46] <%scaryboisupreme> Vetra and the Krogan are the only good squadmates
[4:26:53] <Hillthugsta> @ingman112 co-sign
[4:27:08] <ScreamLord> @Hillthugsta I also liked the new reload animations. Like the Avenger physically opened up, ejected a clip, and you put in a new one. Rather than slapping it outta the gun like in ME2 and 3
[4:27:09] <FightningX> oh my god that looks terrible
[4:27:12] <%Dakuu75> Oh so, just turn your party into huge-nerds so you don't have to be one.
[4:27:17] <Hillthugsta> @scaryboisupreme Peebee has her moments
[4:27:22] <$Captainahab_37> those explosions are super good!
[4:27:26] <$Captainahab_37> from like 2006
[4:27:28] <$lotharrio> Man, how do humans ever lose wars?
[4:27:33] <FutureFranklinRichards> Remember when you had to get out of the Mako to kill these guys to get exp. Not anymore!
[4:27:34] <capjordo> PeeBee is best girl
[4:27:37] <Teras_ode> it's efficient is what it is Kappa
[4:27:40] <+SynnerGee> poor guy gets vaporized, prolly just eating his lunch
[4:27:42] <+Rekinsinn> LUL
[4:27:43] <%templar010> Jesus just RUN INSIDE
[4:27:43] <+MisterAvry> home run!
[4:27:44] <heartlesshealer> shout outs to the delete key
[4:27:52] <%Dakuu75> Super Effective
[4:27:55] <capjordo> Got sick of coras hopeless romantic bullshit
[4:27:56] <Goraka91> I like how you go to Andromeda and the aliens are still just humans, I assumed most of the milky way stuff was the Protheans fucking around
[4:28:02] <DSD24> Mako is so powerful and controls like shit
[4:28:02] <asurite_warrior> What your doing is technically a war crime
[4:28:03] <Vantesla> quick death at least LUL ironmouseKEK
[4:28:10] <Teras_ode> the side quest barn
[4:28:14] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Good thing they took out the EXP pentalty for Mako kills
[4:28:22] <DSD24> Future noises
[4:28:22] <+MisterAvry> look at that birthday pig boy
[4:28:26] <Profmcstevie> Look at this side quest supply closet
[4:28:33] <capjordo> @patstaresat  thoughts on andromeda?
[4:28:38] <$Captainahab_37> is it "technically" a war crime because he's using a technical
[4:28:43] <%AbnormalVoid> yo ho ho
[4:28:45] <%Ranryu692> oh I remember this room
[4:28:49] <Teras_ode> where's the "I WILL DESTROY YOU" ?
[4:28:49] <+Punchasaur> It’s not a war crime if you’re not at war
[4:28:52] <%MrBorisMakarov> nice
[4:28:58] <%twistedj3ster> every time
[4:28:58] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> You can't war-crime a pirate!
[4:29:07] <$Captainahab_37> its not a war crime if they arent citizens
[4:29:07] <DSD24> Weakening their integrity!
[4:29:12] <Goraka91> @Teras_ode They removed it :(
[4:29:18] <DSD24> Oh wait that's ME2
[4:29:23] <%embranz> Spectres can’t commit war crimes, chat
[4:29:30] <Vantesla> A lack of I will destroy you! is sad ironmouseSTARE
[4:29:31] <Teras_ode> @Goraka91 FeelsBadMan
[4:29:42] <%Taisuru> @Goraka91 WHAT
[4:29:47] <Goraka91> FeelsBadMan Enemy is not everywhere
[4:29:50] <ScreamLord> All of the ammo mods would count as war crimes. Especially the radioactive and incendiary ammo
[4:29:55] <+MisterAvry> you shot the shit out of her hip
[4:30:03] <$Captainahab_37> @embranz i dont like this defeatist attitude, im sure if they tried hard enough, they could commit a war crime
[4:30:11] <MagmaRam> @ScreamLord Hammerhead rounds aren't, at least.
[4:30:12] <FutureFranklinRichards> Her sister is going to be pissed in ME2.

[4:45:03] <teefpal> Neither
[4:45:12] <%Monkeyweed21> asshole
[4:45:17] <capjordo> That’s paiges stand
[4:45:18] <aiutare47> @PeachSaliva Why do you tack on longer syllables in proportion to your mental state?
[4:45:18] <$Captainahab_37> neither isnt an option the spider MUST bite
[4:45:20] <%Monkeyweed21> as in, bit on my asshole
[4:45:24] <@PeachSaliva> @sofarfetched is the only me me? are you sure the only you is you?

[4:45:42] <@SoFarFetched> Shit Paige is dropping knowledge on me
[4:45:46] <aiutare47> That makes sense
[4:45:55] <+Fooguwu> if it bit INSIDE you would never kno tho
[4:45:59] <%SMuffinMan> sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm sipsipGasm
[4:46:06] <$Captainahab_37> i know tons of people that add uh to words
[4:46:08] <battlexqueen> I now have to check every room for spiders thanks paige lol
[4:46:11] <@SoFarFetched> @Samurai_Tchan Oh yeah Meowri knows Paige and I seperately.
[4:46:17] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> What if I am a spider and I never knew??
[4:46:22] <%TheLakinessMonster> @PeachSaliva What is it like to communicate with the vortex of souls that is the general public at this scale?
[4:46:31] <capjordo> Spiders can’t kill mold powers
[4:46:33] <@SoFarFetched> But Meowri refers to me as Farfetched
[4:46:34] <Samurai_Tchan> @SoFarFetched huuuh
[4:46:38] <@SoFarFetched> and Paige as peachsaliva or Paige.
[4:46:39] <teefpal> fuck a locust got in my room, the plague is spreading
[4:46:47] <@SoFarFetched> Since there's also PeachJars
[4:46:48] <$Captainahab_37> I cant deal with spiders but Tarantulas are cool
[4:46:48] <@PeachSaliva> @thelakinessmonster feels good man
[4:46:59] <%TheLakinessMonster> nice
[4:47:00] <%GalacticaPhanto> I forgot how good the bass is with headphones y'all it's hype
[4:47:01] <teefpal> PepeLaugh
[4:47:13] <aiutare47> Yes people add uh to words but Paige specifically uses it like a linguistic mood ring and I think thats interesting
[4:47:23] <Samurai_Tchan> @SoFarFetched so youre male or female ? lol
[4:47:26] <%Puhff> catJAM
[4:47:30] <@PeachSaliva> @aiutare47 do I really? I didn’t know that about me!
[4:47:32] <%Bluwizard21> @TheLakinessMonster Pat is pretty low for a streamer. There are insane people that get 5-6k viewers
[4:47:38] <%Dakuu75> @teefpal aren't those things huge-as-fuck? like the length of a standard #2 pencil?
[4:47:42] <@SoFarFetched> @Samurai_Tchan Female,but I'm whatever on the he/she stuff. geefBlank
[4:47:56] <$Captainahab_37> locusts are crazy ass grasshoppers right?
[4:47:58] <Samurai_Tchan> @SoFarFetched hum
[4:47:59] <@SoFarFetched> Is there a concern with me and meowri? geefThink
[4:48:00] <%Monkeyweed21> pat-uh, why-uh, die-uh, etc
[4:48:03] <capjordo> My pronouns are mold/mold
[4:48:04] <$Captainahab_37> fuckin just pissed off hungry grasshoppers
[4:48:29] <aiutare47> @PeachSaliva Ive just noticed that the more upset you are the longer the syllable seems to be. Like that seemed like a longer "Paaaaatuuh" than usual
[4:48:36] <%TheLakinessMonster> @Bluwizard21 That's crazy to conceptualize. So many eyes tied into a small webcam.
[4:48:42] <Samurai_Tchan> @SoFarFetched no no ,I Just heard her saying farfetch a bunch of times
[4:48:44] <+Fooguwu> paige is skully/molder
[4:48:45] <@PeachSaliva> @aiutare47 I’m glad you told me!! That’s so funny!
[4:49:12] <@SoFarFetched> @Samurai_Tchan ooooh okay that's fair. It's because Im usually in the chat when she streams or we hang out off st ream.
[4:49:16] <@PeachSaliva> @thelakinessmonster it’s weird, like you often can feel the weight of eyes sometimes like when you do public speaking
[4:49:21] <Samurai_Tchan> @Captainahab_37 whats a grasshopper ?
[4:49:38] <$Captainahab_37> @Samurai_Tchan a locust in beta

[4:50:07] <@SoFarFetched> @Lodestarrobot thats how it actually goes,you make the run as fast as possible
[4:50:22] <@SoFarFetched> you're not supposed to fight "everything" only when you need to
[4:50:23] <%LeiaSkynoober> @Lodestarrobot Oh like, people cheating to cutscene lock you?
[4:50:26] <%GalacticaPhanto> @lodestarrobot Yo I'm sorry for that it happens because people run it so many times they want out

[4:50:49] <Samurai_Tchan> @Captainahab_37 well yeah.  so its not a slang for anything here then

[4:50:54] <%LeiaSkynoober> well not fast, but do it enough times and you learn how to optimise it

[4:51:21] <$Captainahab_37> @Samurai_Tchan im not sure if theres another word for them its just what i've called them ever since i was a kid
[4:51:48] <%TheLakinessMonster> @PeachSaliva How much does the nature of polite communication change at that level? How do you read a room if there isn't a face?

[4:52:41] <@SoFarFetched> @Lodestarrobot yeah if you're still watching cutscenes and it g oes "the area will close off soon" they probably changed the language or did other things to escape the cutscenes. Because Prae is a run people have done 100+ times.
