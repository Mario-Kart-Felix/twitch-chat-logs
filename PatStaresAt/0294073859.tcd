[0:13:08] <+Valentinopersona> what about 1200 on 24 hookers or 8 high tier hookers
[0:13:10] <reiju_22> it just took way too long
[0:13:13] <blackbaron98> hes on the echo fox team
[0:13:13] <+TeethMuncher> He's being doing that strats for quite some time
[0:13:15] <%SuperCasualBoom> Spell error
[0:13:16] <JDRK> It makes sense, he's just a bitch for actually doing it lol
[0:13:18] <Tropicalhazard> its the meta to seat switch
[0:13:20] <Shiranui24> yes
[0:13:20] <%patriotrenegade> He's gay and he's also the #1 DBFZ player in America
[0:13:21] <+CaptainJax> sonicfox did nothing wrong
[0:13:22] <Gnapalm> I can't believe the smash audience at evo. They spent the whole time chanting "We love bayo! we love bayo!" that they had to postpone the tournament
[0:13:22] <Leebrownie> can't play from the right side kappa
[0:13:23] <roboguy2k> Displaying your fetish publicly is not a substitute for personality
[0:13:23] <CNExoSoul> wooooo \o/
[0:13:24] <$GohanEgret> it's in the rules, it's up to tourney organizers to be ready for it
[0:13:28] <CNExoSoul> time for Poopy bronze!
[0:13:32] <%bluetocho13> its legal but it was still iiky
[0:13:33] <%Ragnarok_Flames> so sonicfox was only good as p1
[0:13:34] <SatansDick1> the reason wesker can teleport is because of the biocurse
[0:13:37] <Shiranui24> yes they did
[0:13:38] <fairore> @jdrk you cant be serious cmonBruh
[0:13:38] <+BGN_Spiral> Sweep cancel is -22 on quickrise, and you can't cancel command grab. 214P is +6 at level 1 though, so that's probably the best one to confirm into. I'll quit backseat labbing, good luck @angriestpat
[0:13:39] <oruandrew> you guys admitting that Go1 lost from a seat switch wut???
[0:13:39] <Flyrant> SonicFox said on twitter he legit wanted to switch sides because he does better on p1 side, wasn't trying to stall
[0:13:44] <Hybrid_Niji> not sonic's fault they were idiots about it
[0:13:44] <+Vulji> I agree
[0:13:47] <%konekoryugamine> FUCKING MADE IT AND I HAVE BITS
[0:13:50] <%konekoryugamine> FOR YOU
[0:13:54] <%psychodave1234> man all these people mad sonicfox is a coolguy deviant in public
[0:13:59] <%Pitagirl_6> goichi even said yes lol
[0:14:01] <marvel877> They needed to translate for Go1
[0:14:01] <yuribo26> @Flyrant he was right
[0:14:02] <MyNameIsRasus> The best part about the whole smash thing is the melee community trying to get the fuck away from the whole situation
[0:14:07] <GamerWorlock> Every tournament Sonic attends now he gonna be counter seated.
[0:14:07] <+ApplePoe> T R A N S L A T I O N
[0:14:07] <Gnapalm> Who asked for the switch?
[0:14:10] <FatDragonQuest> That said Sonicfox needs to learn how to play on the p2 side but happy he won
[0:14:11] <+KgKid51> Lol what pat is saying is sonic cheated LUL
[0:14:11] <+biggysweet> Best player 1 side player
[0:14:12] <prime_name> They took like 10 minutes
[0:14:14] <%konekoryugamine> They are, dude. They fucking are
[0:14:15] <+KingLlama1> everyone is saying it wrong ... its not a seat switch, its randoming for sides , and at after a set reset they should automatically do it
[0:14:15] <Flyrant> @yuribo26 yes he was
[0:14:21] <%Ragnarok_Flames> sonicfox is a babby that wanted to switch sides because Go1 bodied his furry ass
[0:14:21] <%konekoryugamine> Meh
[0:14:23] <Mattmandx1> So Sonicfox only won because G01 was on his bad side?
[0:14:24] <+TheBimbollo> Translation apparently
[0:14:24] <EMP_SaltyMan> shake hands with the president
[0:14:25] <%konekoryugamine> XD
[0:14:26] <Saturdaythe14th> Making somebody cool down is a legit tactic, that ain't cheating
[0:14:26] <tejediego> GO1 was winning game 1 set 2 but he had a missinput that costed him the set
[0:14:27] <+McSoliace> agreed
[0:14:27] <+Bustamente> @Gnapalm Sonic fox asked to switch sides
[0:14:29] <Caivyre> Are you telling me EVO has poor organization?!?! WHAT
[0:14:29] <Fynale> play blazblue akihikos in you coward
[0:14:30] <Shiranui24> rules say loser just get to switch if he wants I think?
[0:14:31] <YungestYuri> @KgKid51 Its not cheating if its in the rules tho...
[0:14:34] <+Jacknzack27> It was about 5 minutes
[0:14:34] <NYCrownlessKing> no pat - sonic admitted the sides didn't matter @AngriestPat he just wanted to waste time.
[0:14:34] <silverback129> translation and bad TO
[0:14:35] <corn_on_fire> no rules broken Jebaited
[0:14:35] <Saturdaythe14th> You fucks know nothing about competitions
[0:14:36] <DrNiles> there should be a 90 second rules for any disruptions like that and if it hits that mark, ignore it and continue as normal
[0:14:36] <$GameOverDeo> Pat coming to EVO 2019
[0:14:36] <CertainlySyrix> That's completely legal to do.
[0:14:37] <+CaptainJax> @AngriestPat in the rules if the guy in the winner's bracket loses he can switch sides if he wants to for the second set
[0:14:40] <%konekoryugamine> Say what you want, but this is one of the better EVos
[0:14:40] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat reminder that it's TECHNCIALLY A RULE that youc an change after literlaly every single game if you lose
[0:14:41] <mercado94> fighting games are dum holy shit
[0:14:44] <NYCrownlessKing> ~ no pat - sonic admitted the sides didn't matter @AngriestPat he just wanted to waste time.
[0:14:44] <%konekoryugamine> FIGHT ME BRAH
[0:14:48] <+ApplePoe> He don't speak ENGLISH brew. takes a min\
[0:14:49] <FatDragonQuest> it's sorta like how in football refs fuckin take like the length of every marvel movie to get back to game
[0:14:51] <fairore> @ragnarok_flames its the tos fault man
[0:14:52] <Rngiddion> It just classic arcade strats anyway
[0:14:53] <%Ragnarok_Flames> he got Bodied
[0:14:54] <SubliminaIMessages> No rules were broken, but that shit was grimey
[0:14:54] <+Bustamente> To be fair, They both did pretty bad in the player 2 seat
[0:15:02] <+xpakeo> pat is evo 2019
[0:15:02] <%GameOverDeo> apatWhat
[0:15:03] <%konekoryugamine> DBZ was fucking awesome though
[0:15:03] <+chief413> At least it wasn't Smash finals bad
[0:15:03] <sponsoredviewer910> do you worry woolie will smell like a smash player when he comes back for the podcast?
[0:15:05] <NYCrownlessKing> no pat - sonic admitted the sides didn't matter @AngriestPat he just wanted to waste time.
[0:15:08] <+biggysweet> SonicFox vs my Negan then we see who is better Kappa
[0:15:09] <Leebrownie> player 2 seat needs a buff
[0:15:10] <@SSaryn> Objectively
[0:15:12] <%Ragnarok_Flames> sonicfox is the golden child and gets whatever he wants
[0:15:12] <CountMeowingtonn> @AngriestPat Now that season 3 is done will there be a Fisticuffs for SFV?
[0:15:14] <WisdomHat> @AngriestPat TALK ABOUT SMASH 4! I like Sonic and Go1. I'm happy and sad.
[0:15:14] <+KingLlama1> also doesnt stop him from being a dirty furry deviant
[0:15:15] <$GohanEgret> cant believe shenron came out
[0:15:16] <arcadeking48> The matches were really solid either way
[0:15:18] <$RubberFistFight> I came in at "sonic cruised to the grand finals", what'd i miss
[0:15:19] <%konekoryugamine> Woolie already smells like a Smask player XD
[0:15:22] <%konekoryugamine> SMASK, SURE
[0:15:24] <Quantus_201> Wasting time is within his right @NYCrownlessKing
[0:15:24] <+gael_jebidibah> Player 2 seat has magic powers
[0:15:26] <+KgKid51> You gonna stream cooler when he comes out?
[0:15:26] <SwindlerOfProgress> It wasn't the most honest win, but it's totally legal. I wouldn't do it, but I don't hold it against him too much.
[0:15:27] <%Pitagirl_6> you right
[0:15:28] <arcadeking48> Like its not as if Go1 just rolled over dead
[0:15:28] <Solideva> go1 smoked him at an exhibition the day before I heard
[0:15:30] <$RubberFistFight> 8 at minimum
[0:15:31] <$birdfella> @NYCrownlessKing It's a legit strat
[0:15:32] <+McSoliace> @NYCrownlessKing that's litterally not true check his twitter
[0:15:32] <+UberWolfman> FGC sounding like Smash players LUL
[0:15:32] <tejediego> Sonic is a fighting game prodigy
[0:15:33] <+Valentinopersona> do it!
[0:15:36] <ValidVenasaur> even with 2 shenron summons
[0:15:37] <+GuelermeDias> is pat already getting smashed
[0:15:38] <EMP_SaltyMan> tryna see some sagoot
[0:15:39] <NYCrownlessKing> yeah, im not arguing against it @Quantus_201 @birdfella @McSoliace
[0:15:41] <+5ofnines> at this point I feel like the logical next step is for Sonic to just like. Turn into his Fursona for real
[0:15:42] <Captain_Joe1911> i got a picture with woolie at EVO :D
[0:15:43] <Serge_12> Yay!!!
[0:15:44] <Flyrant> SonicFox's ability to win scrambles is just too good. I wish the game rewarded defense better, because GO1's defense was incredible.
[0:15:44] <ivansonic08> hello patt
[0:15:46] <+5ofnines> just be the beerus

[0:16:25] <%OfficerBaeJ> Proach you with our Co tips
[0:16:25] <$portabledingus> OF THE WORLD
[0:16:25] <@SSaryn> Hey Pat, play Q good
[0:16:26] <talfurt> Did you see those smash player get fussed at for messing around during the match
[0:16:26] <ThePuddingDead> Why does the "Training" icon look like his dick is hanging out?
[0:16:26] <%ECRead> i got no pro tips
[0:16:28] <+biggysweet> Protip #1: Get a hitbox
[0:16:28] <RedPlasticCup> pro tip: punch the other guy
[0:16:29] <+Gooniekorn> do combo
[0:16:30] <EMP_SaltyMan> G Unit
[0:16:30] <oishiizou> wake up super
[0:16:30] <%PapaSatanSangLouie> My only tip is to randomly press buttons like a Blanca player.
[0:16:31] <%Lolicon_Jon> apatWink
[0:16:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> PRESIDENTIALITY
[0:16:31] <%Ragnarok_Flames> why are you switching sides pat? like everyones favorite furry
[0:16:32] <%SuperCasualBoom> If anything TO should had ask the one going into Winner bracket final and choose the side.
[0:16:33] <+xpakeo> only jump in, true bronze tactics
[0:16:34] <IminyourBase> do at least one raw super
[0:16:34] <FatDragonQuest> here's my pro tip: play G's story mode
[0:16:35] <JDRK> Just AFK and hope they let the idle play out Kappa
[0:16:35] <+blewbeary> MAXIMUM PRESIDENT
[0:16:36] <jojodemi> tip dont get hit
[0:16:36] <%skizzuto> hit punch good
[0:16:37] <%Bustamente> Why arent you pressing every button on wake up!!!!!
[0:16:37] <KTDelgado> hey, dont suck
[0:16:38] <Caivyre> 5 bucks pat loses the first 3 matches
[0:16:38] <Dio_TR> PRO TIP git Gud
[0:16:38] <energywarning> now pay special attention to pat's face as he plays
[0:16:40] <Rngiddion> Is G not just the president from Metal Wolf in fighting game form?
[0:16:40] <crimsonharvest> Pat when is Paige gonna be home to do strims? @AngriestPat
[0:16:40] <Jman409> Hit them more than they hit you
[0:16:41] <ancrest_tant> Just do frame perfect inputs
[0:16:41] <MarylandJutsu> @AngriestPat How is the SWEET BABY today?
[0:16:42] <yuribo26> DANGEROUS Kreygasm
[0:16:43] <Revan122800> DO COMBO
[0:16:43] <YungestYuri> @AngriestPat Remember: Wake-Up Supers work everytime
[0:16:45] <MAX116030> WHY?
[0:16:46] <+Answer_Moose> I got nothing. I'm bad at fighters so I don't play them.
[0:16:46] <prime_name> DANGEROUS PRESIDENT is so good
[0:16:47] <%breakfastmagepowers> COUNTDOWN to PERFECTED
[0:16:47] <+redanimator> snk heronies getting a steam release
[0:16:48] <Dovakhin573> But Maximum Pressident sounds cool
[0:16:49] <Flyrant> why is G trying to steal Chipp's gimmick of being the president?
[0:16:49] <powerprotoman> maximum presidant is better
[0:16:50] <%psychodave1234> protip: hit him but dont let him hit you @AngriestPat
[0:16:50] <Nemesisnick33> AngriestPat protip: dont get hit
[0:16:53] <tejediego> Have you tried Sagat?
[0:16:54] <+fFailureatlife> BUT ITS MAXIMUM
[0:16:54] <+Templar15> that's baffling, it seemed so much better
[0:16:55] <full_metal_n003ie> they should add glenn too so negan has something to hit
[0:16:57] <%konekoryugamine> Go with Bison first
[0:17:00] <BakedCheeseMan> Ultra COMBOOOOO
[0:17:02] <+KingLlama1> DANGEROUS , MOST DANGEROUS
[0:17:03] <+Emperor_Derp> DP
[0:17:05] <$OmegaWeltall> I like Maximum President
[0:17:05] <marvel877> Pro tip: DON'T TOUCH YOUR NOSE.
[0:17:05] <CountMeowingtonn> VT2 has more damage potential
[0:17:06] <EMP_SaltyMan> dangerous president you can tick throw with his command grab @angriestpat
[0:17:06] <$GohanEgret> protip: you'll lose a round if you lose all your health
[0:17:06] <Twoiis> 0 execution
[0:17:08] <%skizzuto> lower their hp before they lower yours
[0:17:08] <Solideva> go to training mode and do the match search there so you can practice a bit @angriestpat
[0:17:09] <Gnapalm> HERICY
[0:17:11] <+KingLlama1> better call MD Geist
[0:17:11] <ultimate_Gohan_Blanco> what kind if inputs does G use ?
[0:17:13] <metaphase72> I’ve never played street fighter, should I give it a try, I’m mainly a tekken player
[0:17:13] <rainsh0wsm3rcy> ello Patrick
[0:17:14] <Captain_Joe1911> notekMilk
[0:17:14] <pede2011> @AngriestPat Is G any similar to Q?
[0:17:15] <MarylandJutsu> HERE WE GO
[0:17:16] <sparrrow_> so it's pretty much confirmed that G is Q right?
[0:17:17] <%konekoryugamine> YOO
[0:17:17] <FatDragonQuest> oh by the way @AngriestPat thanks for causing me to start playing grapplers for about a year now
[0:17:20] <CountMeowingtonn> G uses motion
[0:17:20] <+BGN_Spiral> Maximum President isn't great due to damage scaling and Presidentiality is pretty easy to get
[0:17:20] <TomCrimson> if you end your specials with G charge then yeah vt2 is fine @angriestpat
[0:17:21] <+blewbeary> His presidency is MAXIMUM
[0:17:21] <CertainlySyrix> @pede2011 extremely so
[0:17:21] <@SSaryn> Any significant differences between the two? Mainly just more grabs with Dangerous?
[0:17:21] <MAX116030> Dangerous president allows you to have only to move and 2 bars for it
[0:17:23] <%Bustamente> @AngriestPat Pro tip: pressing the buttons harder makes you do more damage
[0:17:24] <Saturdaythe14th> That's a good color
[0:17:24] <Nemesisnick33> playing games off stream DansGame
[0:17:24] <blackbaron98> G

[0:17:36] <sparrrow_> Red Q

[0:17:37] <DrNiles> You get Dangerous President sooner, it's more versatile and if you can theoretically keep your charges without VT, you don't need that feature of Maximum President

[0:18:35] <Xelhesia> @AngriestPat All androids are forever against you
[0:18:39] <Revan122800> About as good as my fight record
[0:18:39] <Hybrid_Niji> So is he related to Q or what?
[0:18:42] <+TheShal> Here we see classic Ryu. DOMINANT. Shoving his throbbing dick down Pat's baby throat
[0:18:42] <AncelDeLambert> why controller?
[0:18:44] <%psychodave1234> leg so hot hot hot leg leg so hot u fry a egg
[0:18:44] <$RubberFistFight> Wish I could afford SFV

[0:18:52] <yuribo26> President level GO DOWN
[0:18:53] <%breakfastmagepowers> How much more of a Future does SFV have? Lookin at it now that it has decent content but if its on the way out I'd want to know
[0:18:53] <arcadeking48> What is G's gimmick exactly?
[0:18:55] <%konekoryugamine> @TheShal You said that and now fan art exists of it
[0:18:55] <blackbaron98> beat his ass pat!
[0:19:00] <%Agami23> G uses Q's attacks, the story outfit is similar, and he uses Q's buffing mechanic
[0:19:02] <YungestYuri> you can't teach "Don't drop the combo"...
[0:19:05] <+Linearlinera> G gathering energy completely reminds me of Q taunting for big damage
[0:19:06] <Leebrownie> @AngriestPat you can only go over fireballs with the one move if your president gauge is full
[0:19:07] <CNExoSoul> F

[0:22:34] <+gloppie> Is it me or is the game skipping/lagging occasionally?
[0:22:34] <im_backing_down> does eating projectiles with vskill build v meter?
[0:22:35] <something282> Terry Bogard in Flex or fighting layer
[0:22:35] <+SirRoyco> G's only cross up is his down+mp jump attack

[0:24:09] <Hybrid_Niji> SaddestPat
[0:24:09] <+AncientToco> Just don’t get hit 4Head
[0:24:09] <oishiizou> switch to player 1
[0:24:09] <Dovakhin573> You should do training mode while you search for matches
[0:24:10] <+ApplePoe> GET IN THE LAB

[0:24:27] <+TehPryceIsRight> Pat if you win I will subscribe. Use money as a motivator to WIN

[0:26:00] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat for real though, play more aggressively and less conservatively. Instead of waiting for them to do something, bait attacks and press them into opening themself up. I base this on my quite frankly miserable level of fighting game knowledge.

[0:31:49] <TerraWraith> NEAT.
[0:31:51] <Flyrant> I don't think G is actually related to Q, but I'm not 100% sure
[0:31:51] <%konekoryugamine> THis guy's just jumping and spinning like my sister on sugar! Block his ass and parry anything you can!
[0:31:51] <Saturdaythe14th> More questions were added
[0:31:53] <cascadepersona> Roundhouse Eagle Spike is Sweep punishable on block
[0:31:54] <lightsinx98> Pat when is the rant on melee
[0:31:54] <CountMeowingtonn> eagle spike is punishable on block right
[0:31:56] <Mattmandx1> @TerraWraith Nope he's just a street fighter. Literally
[0:32:01] <Arek_1> @terrawraith G's story doesn't touch Q at all.

[0:34:49] <%Verd_254> Bipson time
[0:34:49] <$OmegaWeltall> Don’t touch your nose LUL
[0:34:53] <WisdomHat> Don't let it sink in
[0:34:53] <CertainlySyrix> @lightsinx98 He is not, Q was a black guy.
[0:34:57] <Sedrelic> Dangerous Dab/Maximum Dab
[0:34:58] <%GarbageNirvana> They really upped the presentation for this game didn't they
[0:35:09] <WisdomHat> I thought Q was a robot
[0:35:09] <%konekoryugamine> PARRY WHEN YOU FUCKING CAN
[0:35:09] <MyNameIsRasus> Dabidyne
[0:35:10] <+TheShal> President vs Dictator
[0:35:11] <im_backing_down> @AngriestPat it really doesn't, loads almost instantly since AE
[0:35:13] <CountMeowingtonn> oh no pat doesn't know any CC combos
[0:35:14] <lightsinx98> Oh shit really?? I didnt know Q was black
[0:35:15] <+Weeewer> Hey this guy isnt terrible
[0:35:16] <Ashratcliffe1992> @garbagenirvana Yeah. It's actually a full game now.
[0:35:19] <Flyrant> since when was Q a black guy and not just some freak robot man
[0:35:19] <+TsukuYOMI0> Does G and Q have the same movesets?
[0:35:19] <$RubberFistFight> @OmegaWeltall man I don't know about Pat but every time I start a stream my nose starts itching within like 5 minutes. I have no idea why.
[0:35:21] <something282> does G plays anything like Q
[0:35:27] <faegbeard> BIG JUMPS
[0:35:27] <AlasterAngelo> the upped presentation unfortunately doesnt make the game good
[0:35:27] <%PapaSatanSangLouie> Man... look at all those fucking delicious sheep.
[0:35:29] <%konekoryugamine> Probably
[0:35:30] <Colelegante> You can cancel a sweep into the VT2 command grab to catch a sweep punish
[0:35:31] <Arcana_Magician> he plays a lot like q apparently
[0:35:31] <Ashratcliffe1992> @something282 Some very similar stuff yeah.
[0:35:32] <prettypatties97> Beat Bison just like how Nash did Kappa
[0:35:34] <TheyCallMeVincenzo> Negan is the future.
[0:35:34] <%breakfastmagepowers> Remember the basics of CQC

[0:35:38] <$OmegaWeltall> LUL

[0:35:38] <Shiranui24> Wait I'm in one of those weird past time zones right now. Isn't it late where pat is?
[0:35:41] <Arek_1> @ashratcliffe1992 Nah, the SF1 Sagat costume has a pupil in his eye and no chest scar.
[0:35:43] <ThePuddingDead> god i cant stand bison
[0:35:44] <CertainlySyrix> I think Q was a cyborg. That's my theory.
[0:35:45] <$birdfella> Bison is plus on almost everything. His wakeup options are his weakness.
[0:35:45] <+th3madness> bison is crazy plus
[0:35:46] <%PapaSatanSangLouie> Stupid sheep, be mutton now!

[0:42:13] <im_backing_down> X Doubt
[0:42:14] <TheImmortal70> It's clearly meant to strictly be a punish
[0:42:14] <wsintai> Pat was great at fighting games; 33 Years ago
[0:42:14] <%President_Miyazaki> Does Pat know about G's idle animation attack?
[0:42:19] <clockworkParzival> Pat honestly just needs to figure out a reliable antiair and then he has a free ticket to silver
[0:42:20] <troxcree> @craig_t He was really good at 3rd Strike.
[0:42:20] <%konekoryugamine> @RubberFistFight For a second I thought he harnessed Crazy Talk. But I guess I was off.
[0:42:25] <Crankthulhu> @trevin3dimensions I haven't played G but looking at him, he's nothing like Q
[0:42:27] <element_of_loyalty> KAPOW DETONATE THE DIRTY BOMB AND LEAVE DETROIT TO DROIDS
[0:42:27] <$GohanEgret> Paige vs Pat is 10-0
[0:42:28] <Saturdaythe14th> Holy shit
[0:42:30] <CutCombo> :|
[0:42:32] <phreal95> isnt pat good at 3rd srrike?
[0:42:32] <+keksisblyat> It would be really cool to see you play fighting games more often @angriestpat
[0:42:34] <$birdfella> aa
[0:42:34] <+Weeewer> Pat you back yourself into a corner alot, gotta work on that
[0:42:35] <prettypatties97> Remember kids, all people good at fighting games are dorks, but not all dorks are good at fighting games
[0:42:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ded
[0:42:37] <Captain_Joe1911> notekFeels

[0:42:51] <element_of_loyalty> Matt looks great in this game
[0:42:52] <lightsinx98> how is Sagat?
[0:42:52] <Dovakhin573> What the fuck is that voice
[0:42:52] <pennykettle_> Is For Honor a fighting game
[0:42:53] <ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat I keep thinking he's saying "I have the power of God AND ANIME!"
[0:42:53] <hellinahipflask> dude I'm pressing the button
[0:42:54] <%Jorgon_Skylisk> THAT BOI IS PACKING YOU LUNCH PAT

[0:43:01] <+MONSTRx_x> yeah more fighter games
[0:43:02] <+Eithi007> How does that one earth move work
[0:43:02] <+CaptainJax> it'd be cool to see you play chaos legion more often
[0:43:02] <WisdomHat> I like watching Pat play fighting games
[0:43:03] <KTDelgado> JUST SWITCH TO FOR HONOR
[0:43:03] <EddieBrock> Gief is speaking too real right now in that win quote.
[0:43:04] <+ApplePoe> get good again
[0:43:04] <pede2011> @AngriestPat That's the point, we want to see you suffer
[0:43:04] <OkamiDude15> 4Head just pick a top tier
[0:43:05] <lsandoval2020> Crazy talk strikes again
[0:43:05] <%Nirokahn> Russia is part of earth Zangief...

[0:43:07] <%OdysseyKnight> Just git gud again
[0:43:09] <element_of_loyalty> :D Pat had a soul?

[0:43:13] <full_metal_n003ie> you cant fool the crazy tal
[0:43:14] <$RubberFistFight> Too many FPS for your old man eyes, eh?
[0:43:14] <TheIronBrass> DOOD I WAS BLOCKING
[0:43:15] <InfiniteSwagbito> #MakePatGreatAgain
[0:43:15] <%konekoryugamine> NOPE
[0:43:16] <%skizzuto> play a less gimmicky character maybe?
[0:43:16] <MyNameIsRasus> KUREIJI TAAKU
[0:43:16] <prettypatties97> Hit more buttons
[0:43:17] <Shiranui24> But if you play more
[0:43:18] <Caivyre> Don't worry guys, he knows gief
[0:43:19] <clockworkParzival> @AngriestPat You'll have a much easier time in Bronze if you just find a reliable antiair
[0:43:21] <Crankthulhu> @trevin3dimensions He's no tank like Q, he seems like a weird momentum character
[0:43:22] <+unfoldingchoas> Why not warframe anymore PAT
[0:43:24] <+MONSTRx_x> road to evo 2019
[0:43:24] <%simpo98> Who do you main @angriestpat
[0:43:25] <liliiiiiiiiiiiiil> Street Fighter ResidentSleeper
[0:43:25] <Huntercd> Imagine if Pat Got gud though
[0:43:27] <troxcree> That weird kick not being an overhead upsets me.
[0:43:33] <%breakfastmagepowers> You should play a competitive party game instead of a fighter. Like Smash
[0:43:34] <blockedL> dont you play fighting games every friday tho
[0:43:35] <element_of_loyalty> Pat has
[0:43:36] <%GameOverDeo> maybe Road to Evo 2020
[0:43:38] <antthefool> “NOTHING IS COMPARED TO THE POWER OF MOTHER RUSSIA”
[0:43:38] <%konekoryugamine> How the hell do you anti-air?!
[0:43:40] <sanoblaze> Pat, you just need to use his tools. The fireball helps in general
[0:43:43] <%Jorgon_Skylisk> SEND HIM TO SCHOOL GIEF
[0:43:44] <CutCombo> that's sick
[0:43:44] <+RowenCleric> @AngriestPat because I really enjoy watching someone around my skill level, and not someone who is waaaaaay above me or a place I can realistically get like most
[0:43:44] <+TeethMuncher> @Huntercd i have no time for dreams
[0:43:49] <+trevin3dimensions> @Crankthulhu i just got here too, has he touched tigerman?
[0:43:54] <AlasterAngelo> THE HUMAN CYCLONE'S ABOUT TO BURST
[0:43:54] <Flyrant> lol
[0:43:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nice
[0:43:58] <element_of_loyalty> phew
[0:43:58] <Crankthulhu> @trevin3dimensions Nope

[0:44:00] <corn_on_fire> he DO it
[0:44:00] <+SirTerribleh> That
[0:44:01] <pennykettle_> is that rank # literal? Like pat is the 220,668th best player?
[0:44:01] <clockworkParzival> SeemsGood
[0:44:03] <full_metal_n003ie> i fkn love the drop kick of zangief
[0:44:04] <OkamiDude15> about to BURST woopsGasm
[0:44:06] <%konekoryugamine> This is literally turning into Salty Belt
[0:44:06] <+Answer_Moose> As we get older, the reaction time we have gets worse, time to resign ourselves to Binding of Isaac.
[0:44:06] <lightsinx98> I love G's voice
[0:44:13] <something282> 🍸🍹🍷
[0:44:18] <Sochin_Iitsu> Huge props to Problem X tho
[0:44:18] <$RubberFistFight> oh
[0:44:19] <CutCombo> no. . .that's just his rank
[0:44:19] <ThirdStrike_Alex> Vskill AA
[0:44:19] <im_backing_down> @pennykettle_ yep, barring multiple accounts of course
[0:44:20] <+JayEarly> As a complete casual it’s hard to get into SF after playing ArcSys games
[0:44:24] <+GuelermeDias> you need to figure out his good aa and a punish combo and you're ready for bronze
[0:44:25] <AlasterAngelo> daigo's like 40 and he's got decent reaction times
[0:44:28] <element_of_loyalty> "Like that"?
[0:44:29] <pennykettle_> @im_backing_down right, ty
[0:44:31] <DSD24> Wow that throw was cool
[0:44:33] <$RubberFistFight> you gave this Zangief player his first win, Pat
[0:44:34] <$RubberFistFight> look
[0:44:35] <goddamndavid> Who won SFV at EVO?
[0:44:37] <clockworkParzival> Daigo also has ADHD
[0:44:38] <InfiniteSwagbito> @Answer_Moose I still find it amazing that someone designed a game based off Woolie's childhood
[0:44:40] <clockworkParzival> @goddamndavid Problem X
[0:44:40] <EddieBrock> Good to see G isn't as stiff as Cody animation wise.
[0:44:41] <$RubberFistFight> it says "1 win" and he just beat you
[0:44:43] <+gwanzan> @AlasterAngelo but not Top8 reaction times
[0:44:44] <prettypatties97> We're getting out of this corn- [CRAZY TALK]
[0:44:45] <%YungestYuri> @AlasterAngelo I mean fighting games is his jon as well
[0:44:47] <Sochin_Iitsu> @goddamndavid Problem X from UK
[0:44:50] <+king_of_beggars> @AngriestPat Tell Max to Tell Capcom to get us some Goku and Vegeta costumes for Ryu and Ken.
[0:44:50] <Crankthulhu> The "older men can't play competitve games" thing is a myth for whiny babbies
[0:44:51] <Rellim80> Have you seen Sagat's story? It's great.
[0:44:51] <calder87> the older you get, the more you lean on experience and anticipation and less on raw reaction
[0:44:51] <blockedL> FailFish
[0:44:52] <element_of_loyalty> DEATH
[0:44:52] <%konekoryugamine> SCRUB-BA LUBBA SCRUB-SCRUB!
[0:44:52] <+ApplePoe> Get back into fighting games
[0:44:52] <$CharlesRobinJr> L
[0:44:53] <Captain_Joe1911> notekFeels
[0:44:54] <Flyrant> honestly reaction time isn't all that important in fighting games
[0:44:55] <kingdomkey92> mashing on the super
[0:45:00] <+fFailureatlife> you just got balls to your face
[0:45:02] <xemeas> The jumping is way to frequent
[0:45:05] <%simpo98> G’s Voice actor seems Familiar @angriestpat
[0:45:06] <goddamndavid> @Sochin_Iitsu @clockworkParzival ah cool thanks
[0:45:09] <BimboBagging> As we get older we trade reaction time for experience TPFufun
[0:45:09] <full_metal_n003ie> stop talking pat crazy talk will always win over you
[0:45:10] <+SirTerribleh> Does he have an antiair at all?
[0:45:12] <%PapaSatanSangLouie> The real answer here is to start playing Blanca.
[0:45:15] <@SSaryn> Gief is so fucking good.
[0:45:16] <+JayEarly> @clockworkparzival does he really?
[0:45:17] <ThePuddingDead> Is it just me or does Gief's costume the same shape as Jason X?
[0:45:18] <CutCombo> yes, b.HP
[0:45:20] <Crankthulhu> Your natural reaction times get lower, but practice is practice, just look at Ryan Hart or Alex vaille
[0:45:21] <TheMilhouseExperience> Pat play faster. He found your rhythm.
[0:45:21] <Saturdaythe14th> Holy shit, the dash punch into charge on block
[0:45:22] <element_of_loyalty> Whats the underss cheat code?
[0:45:27] <%bluetocho13> Punish his wiffs more
[0:45:33] <EddieBrock> Nice.
[0:45:33] <CountMeowingtonn> the amount of times Pat is getting away with charging in front of somones face is amazing LUL
[0:45:34] <%konekoryugamine> BIFF
[0:45:34] <%craig_t> @everyone else in chat who know fight games @AngriestPat what do peeople mean when they say "X is a plus"?
[0:45:41] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat do you play for honor? if yes what faction?
[0:45:44] <xemeas> Feet on the ground man
[0:45:45] <+GuelermeDias> PAT WON!
[0:45:45] <%NovaKnightmare> Pat's still got it, Its deep down and buried under his OLDNESS, but its in there.
[0:45:45] <TheImmortal70> Nice
[0:45:46] <+ApplePoe> Just get back into fighting games
[0:45:46] <A_d3adly_zambo> dont choke
[0:45:47] <+KgKid51> Yea I think I love G
[0:45:49] <+zamatermort> Pat and I have the same rank. Dunno if I should be proud of myself or disappointed with Pat
[0:45:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yay
[0:45:50] <pennykettle_> I get sad when they talk about how they are past their prime at games because Im in my prime and I suck at a lot of things
[0:45:51] <DrDialUp> aren't footsies like a forever skill?
[0:45:51] <ThePuddingDead> good job
[0:45:52] <Xelhesia> good shit
[0:45:52] <%lessclams> wew
[0:45:53] <+Weeewer> G is awesome
[0:45:54] <%breakfastmagepowers> Hey a Win
[0:45:55] <%konekoryugamine> Nice
[0:45:56] <DrNiles> LOOK AT ALL THAT METER
[0:45:56] <+MONSTRx_x> six
[0:45:56] <%superc37> @AngriestPat also how tf do you acess the sub discord i never got an invite
[0:45:56] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Hey Pat will we see a Divinity stream from you on the 31st?
[0:45:57] <element_of_loyalty> PAT MASK
[0:45:59] <CutCombo> Wish the coat was longer
[0:46:00] <MyNameIsRasus> VERY GOOD
[0:46:00] <$CharlesRobinJr> that was a close one
[0:46:02] <shadic7700> Fuckin nice
[0:46:03] <Arek_1> @element_of_loyalty Huh?
[0:46:03] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat "Old man barely secures victory."
[0:46:07] <Huntercd> tied up
[0:46:08] <%breakfastmagepowers> @AngriestPat HAXX
[0:46:09] <pennykettle_> :(
[0:46:10] <DSD24> I want you to mash DP
[0:46:11] <+NWR_James> it's all downhill from here
[0:46:12] <im_backing_down> @craig_t they probably mean it's plus on block, which means they get to move before you do
[0:46:15] <clockworkParzival> @craig_t "Being plus" means you can move before the other guy
[0:46:16] <Caivyre> Pretty convincing wins, keep it up
[0:46:20] <calder87> @craig_t plus on block means that when you block a move that's plus, the opponent can start a new move before you can
[0:46:20] <+Weeewer> Do it Pat
[0:46:20] <Twoiis> Rose teased in so many story modes D:
[0:46:20] <$RubberFistFight> ooh he read my thing
[0:46:21] <%konekoryugamine> How old IS Pat?
[0:46:21] <+Elexius> @pennykettle_ everyone feels that way, dont sweat it
[0:46:21] <+fFailureatlife> DO IT
[0:46:22] <TheImmortal70> So real talk, the power of HUMANITY being G's ability is crazy cool
[0:46:22] <InfiniteSwagbito> PAT YOU CAN DO IT
[0:46:23] <Bonbie> I still just play for honor because this stuff looks so intimidating
[0:46:24] <+Weeewer> Just play like once a week
[0:46:25] <corn_on_fire> you have to practice things to be good at them, even if you're in your prime
[0:46:27] <+Weeewer> and youll get a lot better
[0:46:29] <%breakfastmagepowers> 37
[0:46:31] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> I have faith in you Pat
[0:46:32] <+GuelermeDias> i think it's more everything
[0:46:32] <element_of_loyalty> PAT IS PEACH STRONG
[0:46:33] <%craig_t> thanks
[0:46:34] <wsintai> More like the dementia
[0:46:35] <+SlugNut> I've struggled with fighting games for 15 years, can you be past your prime if you never hit your prime?
[0:46:36] <Sochin_Iitsu> Tokido was fighting an uphill battle last night. He had to play and win 3 matches straight just to make it to Grand Finals, and won a 4th to reset the bracket. It would've been a miracle for him to beat Problem X after the reset
[0:46:36] <%Agami23> a lack of muscle memory?
[0:46:38] <Hacerous> you have no reads
[0:46:39] <Caivyre> Pat is 80
[0:46:40] <Hacerous> prob
[0:46:40] <OkamiDude15> BELIEVE IN THE SHIT LORDS THAT BELIEVE IN YOU! woopsG
[0:46:40] <%simpo98> Thoughts on Negan in TEKKEN 7
[0:46:41] <+keksisblyat> @angriestpat I don’t mind, and I’m sure other people don’t mind, that you’re not evo lvl of player. It’s enjoyable to watch people learn fighting games and get good
[0:46:43] <%konekoryugamine> HE'S 37?!
[0:46:44] <+MONSTRx_x> stream it more we give all the good advice
[0:46:44] <+TheShal> You need to play more than twice a year.
[0:46:45] <Flyrant> pat just give up, giving up takes a certain kind of resolve
[0:46:46] <Mr_Strut> The muscle memory is gone.
[0:46:48] <TheImmortal70> I definitely think you should be aiming for more grabs
[0:46:48] <Crankthulhu> Pat's nerves aren't strong enough because he hasn't played enough, that's it
[0:46:49] <+TeethMuncher> Peace has softened Pat
[0:46:51] <+HannibalBeerus> Pat is about ready to be sent to the farm and breed for the feeble life he has left /s
[0:46:53] <%konekoryugamine> To be honest, I thought he was like, 30!!
[0:46:53] <%MisterCrimson> So how is Q?
[0:46:53] <+IHATREID> its more like pat doesnt have the same drive for FIGHTING as he used to
[0:46:54] <$RaikenTB> We need a salt stream with you and Woolie
[0:46:55] <+twohitgood> does pat know what a v-skill is?
[0:46:57] <TheImmortal70> LIGHT IT UP
[0:46:59] <InfiniteSwagbito> Instincts are part of it, but Instincts are derived from experience
[0:46:59] <@SSaryn> It's more like the drive and muscle memory isnt there.
[0:46:59] <+ApplePoe> the just G E T B A C K I N
[0:47:00] <+GuelermeDias> what
[0:47:01] <pennykettle_> @simpo98 Oh boy I cant wait to play as AMC's The Walking Dead's Negan PogChamp
[0:47:01] <+zerokingkh3> LULO
[0:47:02] <frankyxm> LUL
[0:47:02] <DSD24> Damn G lifting Zangief likes its nothing
[0:47:02] <AlasterAngelo> its over
[0:47:03] <%breakfastmagepowers> @konekoryugamine Nah but just say he's 39
[0:47:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ohh
[0:47:03] <Hispanacomida25> @AngriestPat and dont forget you can cancel sweep into command grab so it's good against punishes and you can close range tick command grab
[0:47:03] <+Weeewer> Good stuff Pat
[0:47:04] <+king_of_beggars> Choke.
[0:47:04] <chokingasuka> ooof

[0:47:06] <+ItsBabyrider> You just are out of the loop cause you haven’t played for so long, lost the touch
[0:47:06] <%NovaKnightmare> NOT MY DAY
[0:47:06] <Zinectrik> PAT PLEASE
[0:47:07] <OkamiDude15> choke LUL
[0:47:08] <CutCombo> NotLikeThis
[0:47:09] <ha2ken> Lol. It's over huh
[0:47:09] <+Answer_Moose> you say that now, but go play Mega Man X and then wonder if your reflexes aren't what they used to be.
[0:47:09] <goddamndavid> i have the power of gun!
[0:47:09] <element_of_loyalty> LUL
[0:47:10] <+Fictionalskill> I think a large part of it is that as you get older you have less time for practicing so your skills deteriorate
[0:47:10] <Caivyre> LIT UP
[0:47:11] <Sochin_Iitsu> @AngriestPat So when's SGV?

[0:47:21] <Arek_1> Wakeup Lariat, a 200 IQ move.
[0:47:24] <%konekoryugamine> Well he looks good then!
[0:47:26] <ckbooks> It's all about experience. Unless you're a top player losing your reflexes doesn't matter much when you have tons of game knowledge still to gain.
[0:47:26] <TopLeftCenter> @AngriestPat Pick Sagat and throw tiger shots, no one in SFV know how to deal with real zoning. Low tiger shot, high tiger shot, DP them for jumping

[0:47:40] <%YungestYuri> @Fictionalskill Pat does have the time to practice though, he just plays other games rather than just fighting games.
[0:47:40] <%breakfastmagepowers> Pat is doing good for a 40 year old man
[0:47:41] <Huntercd> Oh shit that was almost a comback

[0:49:38] <WisdomHat> @AngriestPat I'm the same age as you and I'm just getting into fighting games. If you're past your prime I missed mine entirely.
[0:49:38] <Flyrant> @AngriestPat yo pat do you still play FFXIV? just wondering if it's worth getting into.
[0:49:38] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat people are talking about reaction times and stuff, and they do increase with age, but your unfamiliarity with the game is going to be working against you way harder than anything like reaction times or reflexes. If it's been a while since you played last, it'll take some time to get back into the groove. Remember dying to Pinwheel? Same thing.
[0:49:39] <CountMeowingtonn> PAT PLEASE ANTI AIR AAAAAAHHHHH

[0:58:36] <$RubberFistFight> @valachi she could probably just snap it off using her cunt muscles, to be fair.

[0:59:29] <valachi> Boobs are a basic bitch answer. Legs and thighs are way better.

[1:00:46] <A_d3adly_zambo> come on pat be more excited
[1:00:49] <EddieBrock> G doesn't have ultimate defense. Q deconfirmed.
[1:00:51] <yuribo26> ESPN VERSION
[1:00:52] <President_valentine> The jacket is back on
[1:00:54] <DSD24> So the main costume is that she doesn't wear pants?
[1:00:55] <Sochin_Iitsu> It's even hotter when it's just pants missing
[1:00:56] <Velkin999> Ignore the poo poo
[1:00:56] <%CaptainPileDriver> he has 2 projectiles with the v-trigger 1
[1:01:02] <Huntercd> This looks better
[1:01:04] <+MinimumPayne> juri's theme so bad
[1:01:04] <prettypatties97> For some reason I don't mind the boots when the jacket is on
[1:01:08] <clockworkParzival> but the whole point of Q is that his normals were dookie
[1:01:12] <+Weeewer> These obvious anti airs man
[1:01:14] <+Castlemyastle> SFV doesn't have good normals in general
[1:01:15] <+Answer_Moose> Juris move set reminds me of pulum pirna (or however it's spelled)
[1:01:15] <+LordDudeTheFirst> But why is she wearing leather over a swimsuit? doogTrash
[1:01:16] <+Weeewer> It hurts
[1:01:16] <President_valentine> Yeah they fucked up her theme bad
[1:01:27] <@SSaryn> Yeah one thing I see is that G's normals are not the good kind of weird.
[1:01:31] <Ashratcliffe1992> @answer_moose EX Layer. PogChamp
[1:01:31] <%PapaSatanSangLouie> "Not my day!"
[1:01:31] <ThirdStrike_Alex> How can you not like his normal more??? They’re so much BETTER now!
[1:01:31] <element_of_loyalty> SHEEP TAUNT
[1:01:32] <KungFooMaen> juri's theme SourPls SourPls SourPls
[1:01:34] <Saturdaythe14th> G waving at the camera on walking forward is the best
[1:01:34] <%MisterCrimson> G is the President of Earth and gets his power from the Earth. Goku is the Guardian of Earth and gets his power from the Earth. G is Goku.
[1:01:34] <Sochin_Iitsu> steponme
[1:01:41] <+ItsBabyrider> Pat just meaty with cr mp
[1:01:41] <valachi> Cammy > Juri. Prove me wrong.
[1:01:42] <Flyrant> they fucked up all of Juri, she was a way better character in 4
[1:01:43] <%Makototruth> Does G have any invincible reversals?
[1:01:45] <antthefool> Juri’s theme is trash
[1:01:52] <President_valentine> Tue
[1:01:54] <+fFailureatlife> juri will never step on you
[1:01:55] <+ItsBabyrider> On a knockdown, meaty with cr mp
[1:01:56] <+Fictionalskill> I miss Juri being a sadistic sociopathic villain, instead of the edgelord antihero she is now :/
[1:01:58] <President_valentine> *true
[1:02:01] <xemeas> Her theme s awful
[1:02:02] <antthefool> I love Balrogs theme in this one tho
[1:02:04] <%simpo98> Does G have the Q taunt mechanic where he gets Super Armour
[1:02:05] <Huntercd> "Step on me prease"
[1:02:05] <+MONSTRx_x> does G have a reversal dp?
[1:02:13] <Ashratcliffe1992> @fictionalskill She's always been terrible though.
[1:02:14] <prettypatties97> @fFailureatlife Not with that attitude!
[1:02:14] <+fFailureatlife> you arent worth her time
[1:02:15] <im_backing_down> he doesn't
[1:02:16] <dsauce999> Wowee look at this skill
[1:02:16] <Saturdaythe14th> He builds meter instead of buffing his defense
[1:02:19] <Hispanacomida25> I actually love her theme
[1:02:20] <+GuelermeDias> you'd think the juri would've learned to block when pat has full meter
[1:02:24] <element_of_loyalty> WHY PAT
[1:02:25] <Prevot> the worst thing about SFV juri is her default costume
[1:02:28] <+GuelermeDias> considering he never ever reversals otherwise
[1:02:28] <Sochin_Iitsu> Pat, stop getting hit
[1:02:29] <ThePuddingDead> dang
[1:02:29] <+Linearlinera> THE JUMP INS
[1:02:30] <CutCombo> are you really going to CA on wakeup everytime
[1:02:31] <Flyrant> Q didn't get super armor he got more defense
[1:02:32] <+PBJammy> jump
[1:02:32] <Arcana_Magician> WHY DID YOU JUMP IN TWICE
[1:02:33] <%flying_hipp0> stop jumping so much
[1:02:33] <+th3madness> stop jampin
[1:02:34] <$RubberFistFight> @Fictionalskill these days, given enough time, even the coolest characters eventually become shitty angsty edgelords. It's frustrating as hell.
[1:02:34] <InfiniteSwagbito> Pat you jump too much
[1:02:35] <Quantus_201> He's DPing like crazy
[1:02:35] <darkpipboy> My dik is so hard from her...

[1:03:00] <+ItsBabyrider> Go into training mode
[1:03:01] <+GuelermeDias> mike ross jumps worked
[1:03:03] <+Weeewer> I think more important than Pat not jumping in is Pat anti airing

[1:03:28] <ThirdStrike_Alex> G seems to have a lot of what Q had just crazier. Crazier rush juggles and such
[1:03:30] <reiju_22> waxl PogChamp
[1:03:31] <%YungestYuri> Mike looked like he had just come back from the shadow realm
[1:03:32] <grayjammer> No, you're stuck at "horrible" and your opponents vacillate between "okay" and "worse"
[1:03:34] <Copperama> I have the original Street Fighter 5, do I have to rebuy the game fro the new content?
[1:03:37] <%lessclams> spicy

[1:03:45] <Gehtingsberg> Kappa
[1:03:47] <+MONSTRx_x> waxl is a legend i tell you
[1:03:47] <Arek_1> Wow, Mike Ross play Guilty Gear? Cool.
[1:03:48] <Saturdaythe14th> Instead of jumping in, he should really be staying back to charge and space with fireballs
[1:03:49] <%PapaSatanSangLouie> Now put the jacket back on.
[1:03:51] <Saturdaythe14th> and then punish or something
[1:03:52] <CutCombo> @grayjammer Yep
[1:03:52] <AlasterAngelo> Street Fighter V caused Mike Ross to retire in anger. For good reason too this game sucks
[1:03:54] <+GuelermeDias> mike got top 24 in Xrd
[1:03:55] <Ashratcliffe1992> @logothx Hasn't he played 3rd Strike?

[1:04:27] <Copperama> ok, that's good! I thought I seriously had to rebuy everything, I wouldn't put it past them...

[1:21:44] <DSD24> @arcadeking48 That I am not sure of last thing I saw of ARMS was a anniversary for its 1 year since release

[1:34:56] <+Frankyzappa> Good shit Pat
[1:34:57] <ShimmerFairy> Elmo approach!
[1:34:58] <%Da_Big_Mac> apatElmo
[1:35:00] <%Agami23> a better artstyle
[1:35:00] <TheMilhouseExperience> You gave him the biggest gun: the rocket launcher.
[1:35:01] <xeros720> Elmo hitting this stream from the back
[1:35:02] <cosmictrashcan> OOF
[1:35:03] <+S3XYG4MS> elmo being cute behind you
[1:35:03] <knomad2b> can we trust matt with the good ammo tho!?
[1:35:04] <deviljhojho94> lurking elmo
[1:35:05] <Serge_12> Wow
[1:35:05] <ha2ken> The baby
[1:35:05] <+MONSTRx_x> SFV.
[1:35:05] <+Weeewer> All I want from SFV is just a few better normals and more Supers
[1:35:05] <cajjunb> OOF
[1:35:06] <+nathandiel> I love Pat as a greedy item monger
[1:35:06] <NonAddictiveSlurm> HERESY
[1:35:08] <$RubberFistFight> Elmos now upgraded from EAT to CLEAN mode
[1:35:09] <cerberuscarmine> he wiggle
[1:35:11] <+TeethMuncher> uh oh
[1:35:11] <element_of_loyalty> Pat move
[1:35:11] <Gehtingsberg> Look at the Elmo he’s so precious
[1:35:12] <Divryne> HE LURKS.
[1:35:14] <SatansDick1> better art style
[1:35:14] <Flyrant> which bad mechanic do you like best in SFV?
[1:35:17] <mister_z_1994> He's right you know
[1:35:19] <Mnightshyamallama> Just make 3rd strike again
[1:35:19] <Sochin_Iitsu> @AngriestPat You gonna train up 3rd strike for your Eyepatch Wolf match?
[1:35:19] <+zuxen> hey pat does elmo ever chew cables?
[1:35:20] <+TendrilsTwitch> ken was fixed via rathalos
[1:35:21] <element_of_loyalty> BABY
[1:35:21] <dadeaner> a good art style
[1:35:22] <+redstonej> sloppy elmo
[1:35:22] <TheyCallMeVawn> I think V Trigger and V Skill are some of the worst things about SFV. It literally locks out older moves characters used to have behind a meter.
[1:35:22] <+DrunkenDice> @AngriestPat do you want to see Makoto back?
[1:35:25] <Klayton119> Give Canada its own character!!
[1:35:25] <drfaustisdead> I came for SALT not Talk!
[1:35:26] <AlasterAngelo> is Pat the embodiment of the boomer meme
[1:35:26] <+keksisblyat> “Wow you have nothing!” “Yeah I sure don’t...”
[1:35:26] <TheyCallMeVawn> SFV literally has no defense.
[1:35:29] <+S3XYG4MS> awww
[1:35:29] <Mrbaconator> @AngriestPat who from street fighter 4 would you like to come back in 5 personally i want hakan again

[1:35:32] <+Answer_Moose> HERE COMES ELMO!
[1:35:33] <killerking> @angriestpat thoughts on G. He seems really good so far.
[1:35:34] <+TheShal> More costumes for Chun Li would be nice
[1:35:34] <%aishman> @AngriestPat Oh Pat, I asked you this on Twitter but here it is agian! Since you're getting into Tabletop Sim, are you gonna get that Pillars of Eternity dlc for it?
[1:35:36] <%breakfastmagepowers> Makoto should be in ALL games
[1:35:36] <cajjunb> SFV is ugly as hell man
[1:35:36] <Copperama> I want a different art style... some people like it, but ehhhhh
[1:35:37] <knomad2b> sfv has some of my fave footsies tbh
[1:35:39] <Serge_12> i really thought you liked SF4 more than SF5. Thanks For Answering!

[1:36:46] <knomad2b> a bunch of sfv's problems have been ironed out now
[1:36:47] <pandangerous> crosstag's pretty easy to get into I'd think
[1:36:48] <Serge_12> Plzzz more fighting games PAT!
[1:36:50] <%MisterCrimson> @AngriestPat Do you prefer FLEX Terry or girl Terry?
[1:36:53] <Flyrant> don't get SFV
[1:36:55] <Supershadowfan2000> WHENS NEXT SPOILERCAST
[1:36:55] <killerking> @sochin_iitsu SFV is a great place to start
[1:36:55] <NonAddictiveSlurm> @sochin_iitsu skullgirls and GG Xrd are both great imo
[1:36:56] <+Weeewer> SFV actually has good amounts of single player now
[1:36:58] <element_of_loyalty> BABY
[1:37:02] <+Frankyzappa> G might be the best new character in this game so far
[1:37:03] <cajjunb> Just DON't
[1:37:03] <thepardack> Capcom needs to bring back the true money maker. Darkstalkers. I just want hot monster people and weirdos.
[1:37:04] <prettypatties97> I'm not weird, now if you'll excuse me, I have to go cuddle my cat while calling him a piece of shit!
[1:37:05] <ThePuddingDead> hey kitty
[1:37:06] <Flyrant> play Guilty Gear
[1:37:07] <+Templar15> Someone I watch still gets mad about the rootkit @AngriestPat
[1:37:08] <%olliedelosa> it's the BABY
[1:37:08] <%GarbageNirvana> @Sochin_Iitsu Depends on what kinda fightgames you wanna get into really
[1:37:18] <+S3XYG4MS> @Sochin_Iitsu skullgirls is not the best starting point, SF4 or 5 is a good option
[1:37:18] <Huntercd> Rule 63 Terry looks great
[1:37:21] <Gehtingsberg> BABY PEEPEE
[1:37:23] <CountMeowingtonn> @AngriestPat Which characters do you want to see added for Season 4? I'm hoping for makoto
[1:37:24] <element_of_loyalty> GIBZMO
[1:37:25] <Copperama> I bought SFV on launch and it was fucking empty for a casual player like me
[1:37:27] <+Blargimazombie> It's funny how much you were anti-cat in the early TBFP days, been watching some older videos and the difference is astonishing
[1:37:33] <tmix1600> Arcade Edition made it a game not just a fighter
[1:37:35] <Supershadowfan2000> @thepardack sadly those games wont sell for casuals
[1:37:39] <%breakfastmagepowers> I think I'm going to get into Smash, lovely group and proffesional crowd
[1:37:40] <+Answer_Moose> Not related by any means, but seeing as you are a star trek fan, did you see that Patrick Stewart is going to be playing Jean-Luc Picard again?
[1:37:40] <lightsinx98> SNK Heroines for EVO 2019!
[1:37:41] <+Blurryblurton> did I miss the street fighter?
[1:37:41] <+MONSTRx_x> @angriestpat what do you think about BBtag
[1:37:43] <bloodypurpledog> When's Superbestfriends arcade edition
[1:37:49] <+Noni321> @AngriestPat Have you tried playing GoW on Give Me God of War difficulty?
[1:37:50] <Spydurman> suuuuuuure
[1:37:51] <%bootysteve> oh shit did I miss pat reading my comment

[1:37:54] <element_of_loyalty> :D
[1:37:55] <+TsunamiPoro> UH HUH
[1:37:55] <TheyCallMeVawn> I wish SFV was more consistent with the quality of their characters. Like with animations and gameplay. Sagat and G look fucking sick, but Falke and Cody were awful.
[1:37:55] <%SaltyDongs> sad
[1:37:56] <thepardack> @Supershadowfan2000 I'm casual as fuck and I want that game more than anything.
[1:37:57] <%Da_Big_Mac> !uptime
[1:37:57] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 37m 59s.
[1:37:58] <spiegspikel> I got SFV at launch and was disappointed beyond words. I’m seriously considering giving AE a chance, though.
[1:37:58] <+capnbeeb> and I perfected the first dungeon tonight

[1:39:02] <tmix1600> YES
[1:39:05] <Mnightshyamallama> So is G anything like Q?
[1:39:05] <+MONSTRx_x> @angriestpat pro tip:drink water every hour
[1:39:05] <+Weeewer> At least learn 1 crush counter combo
[1:39:06] <KTDelgado> just stop jumping
[1:39:10] <Sochin_Iitsu> Learn the BnBs, loser
[1:39:13] <NonAddictiveSlurm> ..... wait @angriestpat were you playing G when Sagat was available or has my stand powers activate
[1:39:14] <+Sticky80sbaby> yeah unfortunately
[1:39:16] <+Blurryblurton> @cajjunb There really isn't much story
[1:39:18] <tacostarvedbeast> yup charges make a big difference, gonna make it take a lil longer to learn his frame data
[1:39:23] <blockedL> Get in the Lab
[1:39:23] <dsauce999> the Air BnBs

[1:39:24] <+Aztec50> where can i find this google doc of G bread and butters
[1:39:27] <Saturdaythe14th> Basic combo into charge, substitute charge with meter taunt if you're max level
[1:39:30] <Saturdaythe14th> ez
[1:39:31] <tmix1600> HIS CHARGE MATTERS PAT
[1:39:32] <+Blurryblurton> He's some viral guy and nobody really knows where he came from
[1:39:33] <cajjunb> He's just crazy?
[1:39:34] <CountMeowingtonn> Sagat's got the kara cancels and i can't handle it lol
[1:39:35] <%breakfastmagepowers> Pro Tip, take a shower often so you don't get stinky
[1:39:36] <DrNiles> the trick is to get solid with all his no-charge stuff first
[1:39:37] <+TsunamiPoro> play the spooky lady

[1:41:48] <Arek_1> @rubberfistfight WHAT?!
[1:41:51] <Twoiis> Capcom nerfed my Laura.
[1:41:51] <%GarbageNirvana> I honestly think they're keeping him like this to spite Ken mains
[1:41:52] <Flyrant> that's because they out sourced a lot of the 3d assests
[1:41:52] <Clinnamon> superimpose Cody's face onto Ken's body
[1:41:52] <Sochin_Iitsu> So is Dragon Ball literally worse than Naruto? Yes. But do more people like Dragon Ball cuz it came out when they were kids? Also yes.
[1:41:54] <Wobuzhidao> but later characters have a 50/50 to has awful animations too
[1:41:54] <Copperama> A SFV mod that just puts a censor bar over Ken's face
[1:41:54] <corn_on_fire> "we figured out the face technology" -sfv crew
[1:41:55] <MrBotchamania> Ken's ugly, working as intended.

[1:42:00] <+SagatAteMyCornFlakes> LUL
[1:42:02] <$RubberFistFight> @prettypatties97 yeah, they claim it's to stop child exploitation. The logic is so unbelievably fundamentally broken.
[1:42:02] <something282> because they want people to like Abigail
[1:42:05] <spiegspikel> Ken doesn’t deserve a decent looking face
[1:42:06] <%Iplatypusprime> man kens theme is the shit tho
[1:42:08] <+king_of_beggars> IT IS HIS DUTY TO PRESIDE OVER THAT BOOTY
[1:42:15] <+GuelermeDias> b-cups are perfectly acceptable

[1:42:31] <+Sticky80sbaby> can you lose his charge at all?
[1:42:35] <%Keeble24> Has Pat ever played Cody?
[1:42:35] <Sochin_Iitsu> A cups and B cups are best tiddy, don't @ me
[1:42:36] <NerevaRising> so whats the deal with G? is he related to Q?

[1:43:14] <tacostarvedbeast> something about kens drags people down to his level, unless your actually good
[1:43:16] <Supershadowfan2000> @sochin_iitsu it can be argued that natuto has better story and chatavters but i grew up with dragonball shouldn't be hard to find out where my allegiance lies
[1:43:18] <Flyrant> @yuribo26 is that too few for you?

[1:47:54] <+SaltySnax> @AngriestPat That's definitely +8 on hit my dude.
[1:47:57] <Clinnamon> yeah it takes a minute, its just a fun gag that will never happen in a real match
[1:47:58] <Sochin_Iitsu> Mmm, Cammy~
[1:47:59] <President_valentine> Cammy
[1:48:05] <clockworkParzival> Cammy DansGame
[1:48:07] <RAAAAAINMAKER> command throw is 12f startup
[1:48:08] <NonAddictiveSlurm> dude... i'd actually buy SFV if they brought back Dudders
[1:48:08] <+Belakitu> doodLewd Cammy
[1:48:14] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat So we know Paige's crazy mcdonald order but what do you tend to buy?
[1:48:14] <knomad2b> mmm my main cammy here to wreck
[1:48:15] <%IKilledADeadGuy> @answer_moose It’s frame data
[1:48:16] <+S3XYG4MS> CAMMY Kreygasm
[1:48:16] <startadevy> itmejpSALT
[1:48:19] <SirTerribleh> He bout to get bodied
[1:48:20] <Flyrant> they need to bring back Makoto
[1:48:22] <Copperama> Time for impossibly tight clothes
[1:48:24] <DSD24> I like Cammy's theme
[1:48:24] <+SirRoyco> CAMMY'S THEME
[1:48:24] <SolidusSeby> CAMMY
[1:48:26] <Saturdaythe14th> G looks soooooooo much better with this costume than his default
[1:48:26] <Huntercd> Did they ever fix her intro?
[1:48:28] <%Remery_> Cammy did nothing wrong
[1:48:43] <Copperama> How does the cloth go so far into her belly button? It makes no sense!
[1:48:44] <+Sticky80sbaby> @saturdaythe14th you take that back!
[1:48:46] <vampireinarm> ***
[1:48:53] <NonAddictiveSlurm> Cammy did nothing LUL
[1:48:56] <RAAAAAINMAKER> Has great range and damage and ca combos though so 12f is fair... I guess
[1:48:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> T H O T B E G O N E
[1:48:57] <%Keeble24> Makoto is cool I guess, but i need my original brawler boxer back haha
[1:48:57] <$Smolkupo> can of sprite, can of sprite
[1:49:01] <Saturdaythe14th> I don't like scraggly SFV hair, and his beard is huge
[1:49:03] <%Jpdodds> apatBig apatFist
[1:49:03] <crimsonharvest> So is this new dude like the japanese interpretation of the shift in american diplomacy?
[1:49:06] <+preppyposs> WOW
[1:49:07] <$RubberFistFight> @Copperama there are actually certain fabrics that will do that, it's weird but awesome.
[1:49:11] <+preppyposs> THATS A LOTTA DAMAGE
[1:49:12] <+DrunkenDice> The power! PogChamp
[1:49:14] <Flyrant> Makoto is the coolest
[1:49:15] <Gehtingsberg> Oh man this person is way higher rank than pat NotLikeThis
[1:49:15] <+Weeewer> @AngriestPat you should try out ex command throw. I imagine its faster
[1:49:20] <%Jpdodds> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[1:49:21] <knomad2b> bad call
[1:49:23] <Caivyre> STOP CHARGING LOSER
[1:49:24] <%YungestYuri> REmember: Whoever came up with the idea of teh boxer is retarded
[1:49:29] <Sochin_Iitsu> Cammy with pants is like Rey Mysterio without his mask
[1:49:31] <+SirRoyco> You coulda thrown her
[1:49:35] <mjama12> Don’t jinx it
[1:49:35] <+Soul_Bruce_Lee> Cammy ResidentSleeper
[1:49:42] <+SWindleFeD> @Answer_Moose ok so imagine your opponent blocks your punch, if your punch is say +3 on block, then that means you go back to neutral status 3 frames faster than the opponent goes out of blockstun
[1:49:44] <%GarbageNirvana> Oh hey Cammy
[1:49:48] <startadevy> wwtvPRAISE
[1:49:51] <%GarbageNirvana> Hardly ever see Cammy in this game
[1:49:59] <$RubberFistFight> @Copperama I take that back, I just saw a shot of it front-on, and that shit is impossible. You'd be able to make out all the detail of her tits and pussy if the fabric was capable of conforming that tightly to her navel.
[1:50:00] <knomad2b> cammy lives her life with an everlasting wedgie
[1:50:06] <+GuelermeDias> that super seems really bad for combos in the corner
[1:50:06] <Flyrant> you must not watch or play the game often
[1:50:12] <+Soul_Bruce_Lee> Cammy is top tier LUL
[1:50:12] <%Jpdodds> She draws strength from it
[1:50:13] <DSD24> Power of the god Hand

[1:50:58] <Arek_1> @guelermedias G' CA can land all 3 hits in the corner, but maybe not in a juggle.

[1:58:17] <startadevy> why?
[1:58:17] <mister_z_1994> @RubberFistFight Funny you should say that, cuz G actually says "It's Super Tuesday" for some of his attacks
[1:58:19] <%HanPaul> He's Steve but a tryhard
[1:58:25] <+DeaconBluesClues> is he losing to that red pand that is actually not a red panda but a 30 year old japanese accountant woman
[1:58:26] <%Fenrirlives> so what's G's Story? Does he have Urian Powers?
[1:58:28] <Sulliman34> so IS G actually Q?
[1:58:28] <startadevy> wwtvPLOT

[2:06:03] <Sochin_Iitsu> Pat is basically Fuudo with all these input errors
[2:06:06] <%DevinMayCry> Aha
[2:06:08] <$GohanEgret> @Eternal_Nihilism they just did vanilla sf5, not AE

[2:06:42] <$CharlesRobinJr> gave em the two piece no biscuit
[2:06:42] <%PapaSatanSangLouie> Canadian combos are just a pretzel stuffed with poutine.
[2:06:43] <RurouniGeo> Light it up theandHAHA
[2:06:47] <%Electrorgasm> American reset is when you just plain fuck up and then get a hit

[2:07:39] <%Iplatypusprime> all ryus are beautiful. share if u agree
[2:07:41] <+sayaman012341> @AngriestPat Could be worse, could be australian resets, where you drop a combo and lose because you got bitten by a brown snake and died
[2:07:43] <prettypatties97> All you gotta do is get some hits in
[2:07:45] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @Crippl3 It gives him an armored command grab, and some combo-extension... But mostly an armored command grab
[2:07:51] <RAAAAAINMAKER> this guy plays a lot of ryu to earn that colour
[2:07:52] <WackyXmand> Man G is tall.
[2:07:56] <%HanPaul> his walk cycle is slick
[2:07:56] <+Crippl3> @MainMan_Jonadiah neat
[2:07:58] <%ssjklyco> Ryu looks a little like Naruto
[2:08:00] <wsintai> @Iplatypusprime If he Hadoukens, HE'S A THOT
[2:08:01] <AlasterAngelo> i really feel for ryu mains because their character is both boring and bad
[2:08:03] <Mnightshyamallama> G's walking animations look really goofy

[2:09:28] <Aleate> He cri for his daddy D:
[2:09:29] <CaramelThvnder> I could never get into SF V fully. Should I go at it again with stick instead of a controller
[2:09:30] <+Ziryuri> karaCry karaCry karaCry
[2:09:31] <IminyourBase> elmo is concerned for how much exposure your balls are getting
[2:09:33] <+Blurryblurton> elmo is the cutest at ever
[2:09:35] <startadevy> the game just puked you out eh?
[2:09:43] <Copperama> back from bathroom, did Pat keep his win streak?
[2:09:47] <Saturdaythe14th> Nope
[2:09:48] <%Jpdodds> nopr
[2:09:48] <Arek_1> @yuribo26 Respect the fact that this Ryu took him to level 50 for that color. Dayum.
[2:09:49] <ikea_recliner> @CaramelThvnder That wouldn't matter at all
[2:09:51] <Flyrant> @CaramelThvnder no a stick won't really make a difference
[2:09:53] <NonAddictiveSlurm> @copperama not by long shot
[2:09:59] <+sayaman012341> so do you have to block low for his fireball?
[2:10:00] <Sochin_Iitsu> The man who just had an 11 win streak, everybody
[2:10:03] <arcadeking48> So does a different V-Trigger completely change how a character plays? Cause Im seeing throws and moves I didnt see before even outside of the new Trigger
[2:10:03] <%PapaSatanSangLouie> See, this is what happens when you get cocky, kid.
[2:10:09] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @Crippl3 Timing an attack as soon as the opponent is waking up, so that it catches them if they try to counter attack.
[2:10:10] <IminyourBase> your balls must do art for free because SO MUCH EXPOSURE
[2:10:11] <reonome> git gud pat
[2:10:23] <%DevinMayCry> This ryus the real deal
[2:10:23] <prettypatties97> @IminyourBase Fuck that's good
[2:10:24] <RurouniGeo> that man has been struggling with ryu for 3 seasons by now
[2:10:28] <%Remery_> always dick punch
[2:10:29] <%ssjklyco> Right in the thigh
[2:10:29] <Saturdaythe14th> If you're gonna rock Maximum Prez you gotta use the specials
[2:10:31] <CaramelThvnder> @ikea_recliner @flyrant I use both. Any tips for getting settled into it? It jus feels way off to me
[2:10:33] <$CharlesRobinJr> come on pat you got it
[2:10:34] <+SWindleFeD> @arcadeking48 a lot of them do, some don't change much
[2:10:36] <Saturdaythe14th> Throw barriers at em
[2:10:43] <cerberuscarmine> starring ryu from monster hunter world
[2:10:49] <StrawberryPantsu> Why would anyone wake up DP
[2:10:58] <+xpakeo> it seems like pat is enjoying himself :)
[2:10:59] <StrawberryPantsu> Unless
[2:11:02] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Pat no
[2:11:02] <%ssjklyco> Starring Ryu from Power Rangers
[2:11:03] <StrawberryPantsu> UNLESS
[2:11:03] <+Ziryuri> The more u jump the more he reads
[2:11:04] <NonAddictiveSlurm> @strawberrypantsu instinct Kappa
[2:11:10] <%Keyd00d> hadoken tho
[2:11:12] <Sochin_Iitsu> And this is why Pat couldn't make top 8 in EVO if he tried.
[2:11:12] <+sayaman012341> For the exact same reason you asked. Because wakeup DP is stupid
[2:11:15] <StrawberryPantsu> You do it the first time to bait them
[2:11:21] <+Weeewer> @StrawberryPantsu agreed, hope he plays more often he'd enjoy it even more if he got consistent
[2:11:25] <Caidezes> Pat's losing to the mind games.

[2:13:15] <prettypatties97> Tiger PogChamp
[2:13:15] <yuribo26> Sagat's model looks amazing, the thinner look is great for a muay thai fighter
[2:13:16] <+Crippl3> sagat should be able to use the tiger as a striker
[2:13:16] <%Remery_> kitty

[2:13:42] <+Blurryblurton> makes me look at his older stuff in disdain
[2:13:42] <ThePuddingDead> oh well
[2:13:44] <+sayaman012341> So is this just sf4 sagat?
[2:13:45] <%Agami23> does sagat look weird to anyone else? like, not muscley enough?
[2:13:47] <%Keeble24> dumb question
[2:13:57] <Sochin_Iitsu> Bob Sagat
[2:14:00] <Baconrath> @AngriestPat are they going to bring back the vanilla sagat costume
[2:14:01] <+RowenCleric> why would anyone not use cool new Sagat
[2:14:05] <CaramelThvnder> My fighting game skill goes Tekken SF Mahvel
[2:14:06] <Mnightshyamallama> this is really a battle of the big boys
[2:14:10] <yuribo26> @Agami23 he is thinner in comparison to his SF4 model. But most muay thai fighters are thin like that
[2:14:12] <+Linearlinera> is G v-skill invincible on startup or nah?
[2:14:13] <marzedwin> Dat Sagat damage tho
[2:14:20] <Aleate> This... is honestly the first time i have seen Sagat in game. he looks kinda... skinny? idk
[2:14:21] <startadevy> 50
[2:14:25] <ThePuddingDead> i've never lost to sagat
[2:14:26] <%HanPaul> Not Pat's day> rip
[2:14:27] <ThePuddingDead> ever
[2:14:27] <Axonn1018> Maybe it's SF2 Sagat? He was thinner there
[2:14:29] <%SuperCasualBoom> Like two slim Jim’s fighting each other
[2:14:29] <Doc1790> NOT MAH DAY

[2:14:39] <Mattmandx1> @Aleate He was skinny back in SF2
[2:14:39] <+Weeewer> I like how Sagat looks skinny ripped
[2:14:41] <Flyrant> sagat looks smaller than in SFIV
[2:14:41] <%HanPaul> Sagat toned down the roids
[2:14:42] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I was just looking at it: Sagat is 7'5", but he only weighs 216 pounds. He's actually just a really skinny boy.
[2:14:43] <+Weeewer> He looks like a lean mother fucker
[2:14:43] <TerraBranfordStrife> use D4C
[2:14:44] <Sochin_Iitsu> Sagat hasn't been eating well, guys.
[2:14:45] <+Weeewer> He looks great
[2:14:47] <troxcree> I can't believe that Sagat's fireballs aren't part of his V trigger, I figured they'd do something like that to screw him over.
[2:14:49] <startadevy> later
[2:14:50] <Clinnamon> I mean everyone was on roids in SF4
[2:14:54] <vingadivo> STOP SKINNY SHAMING

[2:19:57] <Valask> oh wow Sagat is finally here?
[2:19:58] <Flyrant> damn I really like the new sagat look
[2:19:59] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Eat projectiles with it, block jump-ins with it, and use jumping light kick into v-skill for dank combos
[2:20:01] <%Remery_> That Tiger's been eating people!
[2:20:01] <IncredibleMeh> So does G play similar to Q at all?
[2:20:02] <editorsebas> Use the V skill when you feel you don't need reversals
[2:20:02] <+KgKid51> Tiger
[2:20:03] <tmix1600> V skill non ex fireballs and cross ups
[2:20:05] <Quantus_201> On tall characters you can get an instant overhead into vskill
[2:20:05] <$RubberFistFight> @TheShal worse than french - french-CANADIAN :P
[2:20:08] <%IKilledADeadGuy> His v skill is a good anti air
[2:20:10] <%Agami23> wait. if sagat has a tiger, why does he genocider them?
[2:20:12] <+RowenCleric> that Sagat costume is s cooooooool
[2:20:13] <SuperSaiyanSora> TIGER
[2:20:13] <+chozo_55> Use the V Skill for projectiles.
[2:20:14] <Sochin_Iitsu> Look at those ghost blowjobs!!
[2:20:15] <%HanPaul> Maan, punsihed Sagat looks cool
[2:20:17] <AlasterAngelo> my fav sagat costume is still mafia sagat from 4
[2:20:18] <lightsinx98> so the shield just nullifies the attack or is it like M.Bison?
[2:20:19] <Delror> ey boys just got here, how's Pat doin
[2:20:20] <+kukadin> This dude loves jump in, pop those anti airs
[2:20:22] <Clinnamon> no no, its the tigers that are doing the genociding

[2:20:30] <+Crippl3> I love G's walk cycle

[2:32:16] <Doc1790> Suffer like G did. Kappa
[2:32:18] <Flyrant> it wasn't even to put Go1 on ice, it should have take 30 seconds but the refs were idiots
[2:32:18] <Eternal_Nihilism> There are brakes on the Sagat train!
[2:32:22] <@Pandora_Prime> Rub belly to increase Presidentiality.
[2:32:23] <+Psyco6> It's not cheating,but he did it to throw off the momentum of GO1,but wont admit it
[2:32:24] <$GohanEgret> ewww
[2:32:24] <%SuperCasualBoom> Fun fact: Rosa Parks gave up her seat for Sonic Fox. 🤣

[2:32:28] <cerberuscarmine> big bag
[2:32:29] <Arek_1> @valask Sonic Fox asked for a side switch knowing the TOs wouldn't know if it's legal and would waste a lot of time to ice Go1.
[2:32:30] <%Keyd00d> TIGER
[2:32:30] <+Belakitu> TIGER, TIGER
[2:32:32] <FrenchTact1cs> Sagat Fighter V
[2:32:36] <Valask> oh god pat don't talk about your cat's loose skin god dammit
[2:32:42] <%PatNTheHat> He's wearing pick boxers that's how you know you're fucked
[2:32:42] <$GohanEgret> @SuperCasualBoom strong
[2:32:44] <RAAAAAINMAKER> Oh its not like everyone's been complaining about Sagat for 3 seasons or anything
[2:32:44] <%Keyd00d> Play TIGER TIGER to level up Poppi
[2:32:45] <%Linearlinera> shoot him before he can shoot you
[2:32:52] <Flyrant> lol he did not know the refs wouldn't know the rules
[2:32:57] <marzedwin> pink equals high rank
[2:32:58] <+boosh5> Fiber
[2:32:59] <+Crippl3> @Arek_1 dude it's literally in the rules, why would the refs not know
[2:32:59] <A_d3adly_zambo> U got this now. Belly luck skill activated
[2:33:05] <Saturdaythe14th> If he wanted to ice him he would just take a break
[2:33:06] <Valask> @Arek_1 now you're gonna have to explain what icing is
[2:33:07] <Saturdaythe14th> which is also legal
[2:33:12] <%finaltrinity5> I mean he definitely iced goichi but he also beat him fair and square
[2:33:18] <Saturdaythe14th> also who cares about icing, this is also in the rules
[2:33:20] <Valask> what the hell is icing
[2:33:21] <Saturdaythe14th> just be good at the game
[2:33:22] <%TheGershon> What does iceing mean?
[2:33:23] <$Sayie> @Crippl3 Probably because not bamy people do it
[2:33:25] <Flyrant> it's a totally legit thing to do, fuck he can just ask for a break after a reset, it's totally legal to do so
[2:33:27] <troxcree> @Flyrant Even so they're obscure rules intended for back when they still used cabinets.
[2:33:27] <%bevyrage> yeah looks like the major problems i can see are derived from not having a proper feel for the range of your attacks
[2:33:32] <Tuskor13> this guy likes that fireball
[2:33:33] <%Keyd00d> chocolate icing
[2:33:36] <+Psyco6> It's something thats hardly ever used,especially in Grand finals
[2:33:36] <%bevyrage> also holy crap does G have reach
[2:33:37] <+MONSTRx_x> guys its all legal but remember being a furry is not RISEUP
[2:33:40] <$GohanEgret> @TheGershon cool down a player who is seen to be on a hot streak/playing well
[2:33:40] <Arek_1> @valask Cooling down Go1's momentum.
[2:33:41] <+Crippl3> @Valask it's a football term, it means taking a timeout or break right before an important play like a kickoff to get in your opponents head and hurt their momentum
[2:33:42] <Saturdaythe14th> "icing" is cooling somebody down, like they're on a roll so you take a break
[2:33:42] <TheyCallMeVawn> Icing is just killing momentum by stalling pretty much
[2:33:48] <%Keyd00d> NOICE
[2:33:49] <%HanPaul> SonicFox wanted that extened ice
[2:33:49] <+Weeewer> YEAH DO IT
[2:33:50] <%Linearlinera> THE FLIPKICK

[2:34:04] <GreatestGuess> G’s sweep isn’t actually safe is it? Haven’t seen anyone punish it yet.
[2:34:06] <Copperama> I just told myself it was over, Pat coul
[2:34:06] <RAAAAAINMAKER> Play the game or you're both dq'd
[2:34:11] <Aleate> What does Sagat say guys? I am not hearing it very much Keepo
[2:34:17] <%PatNTheHat> PUNCH HIM IN THE BALLS
[2:34:18] <ObsidianDragon86> pat stop jumping you are not a rabbit1
[2:34:19] <@Pandora_Prime> TIGER TIGER TIGER TIGER TIGER TIGER TIGER TIGER TIGER TIGER
[2:34:19] <+Crippl3> Reminder that SonicFox could have just requested a break if he actually wanted to ice Go1, which would have taken more time
[2:34:20] <cgmerryo> TIGER!
[2:34:22] <+Psyco6> Sonic wouldn't have won unless he did that and he knows it since Go1 was mopping the floor with him
[2:34:24] <Copperama> Pat couldn't make it to him with that much health! BUT HE DID IT
[2:34:30] <marzedwin> kick him in the ear
[2:34:30] <$eisigerR> whats with that weird gold dog on the car
[2:34:33] <%Linearlinera> give em the ol' walk up grab
[2:34:34] <Saturdaythe14th> He lost literally one set the entire tournament
[2:34:34] <+Weeewer> Remember command grabs
[2:34:37] <FrenchTact1cs> If "icing" made GO1 lose he didnt deserve it. Thats johns.
[2:34:37] <Flyrant> people saying SonicFox was trying to ice GO1 are moron's. The dude can literally just ask for a break after a bracket reset within the rules
[2:34:37] <Valask> I mean I didn't see what happened but I'm glad there's salt. Means people actually care.
[2:34:39] <%Keyd00d> that's a ram
[2:34:49] <$eisigerR> what ram?
[2:34:56] <$Sayie> SonicFox just wanted to switch to the seat he was most comfortable with and the people behind the scenes took way too long to actually get it happening
[2:34:56] <+Weeewer> Risky!
[2:34:58] <marzedwin> that's a chinchilla sir not dog
[2:34:58] <+Weeewer> VTRIGGER
[2:35:01] <cgmerryo> @AngriestPat he's baiting your jump every time

[2:35:07] <MainMan_Jonadiah> "I wish that was longer." Heh, I bet that's what Paige says too!
[2:35:09] <cerazor01> Power Through the Earth!!! Light it up!
[2:35:11] <+Crippl3> People are just mad that a gay furry won their anime game lmao
[2:35:12] <%bevyrage> decent combo but feels like a waste
[2:35:15] <%bevyrage> OH

[2:35:23] <RAAAAAINMAKER> Balrog punched through the walls while breaking into the bank in the story
[2:35:25] <StrikeTheErf> I mean, just because it was totally legal doesn't mean he wasn't trying to ice him
[2:35:25] <%bevyrage> damn
[2:35:28] <+MONSTRx_x> you guys do know Sonic was waiting for his GF for like 30mins while Go1 was cooking.
[2:35:28] <marzedwin> lmao
[2:35:29] <Valask> JUST GO FOR THE CROUCHING SWEEP PAT
[2:35:34] <blockedL> couldve cancel low dash into trigger
[2:35:34] <Valask> THEY NEVER SEE IT COMING
[2:35:37] <Valask> THEY NEVER
[2:35:39] <%PapaSatanSangLouie> I wonder if Sagat likes tigers?
[2:35:40] <marzedwin> pat learning????
[2:35:40] <Valask> SEE IT COMING
[2:35:41] <+SlugNut> He's pretty good even without depth perception
[2:35:41] <Sochin_Iitsu> @MainMan_Jonadiah You almost got me tho. Major props
[2:35:45] <+Weeewer> Man thats a GOOD low
[2:35:48] <+Psyco6> He could have asked for a break,but he didn't,and with seat switching it's done even if one person doesn't want it to
[2:35:51] <%GarbageNirvana> I always forget how huge Sagat is
[2:35:52] <Arek_1> Remember, just because a tactic is legal, doesn't mean it can't be disgusting.
[2:35:52] <Flyrant> People are just mad that SonicFox is better at a game they like
[2:35:58] <Saturdaythe14th> Hey he's using the moves
[2:36:03] <JuniperWizard> Came here thanks to Paige twitter response of the year because I’m not getting notification...

[2:36:23] <%Remery_> Pat, fight like Elmo's life is on the line!
[2:36:24] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @Sochin_Iitsu I hesitated for a second thinking "should I say this? Is this too mean? nah!" And that made all the difference.
[2:36:26] <WackyXmand> Good Match thought.
[2:36:26] <Sochin_Iitsu> "I tried" you fucking didnt

[2:36:55] <Arek_1> @fairore lolhegaytho
[2:36:56] <FrenchTact1cs> Hey, maybe sonicfox is actually good
[2:36:56] <+Crippl3> Ah yes, Dragonball FighterZ, that super dead game that he only wins because there's no participants
[2:36:59] <%HanPaul> is his fireball really just a low
[2:37:02] <fairore> god dam
[2:37:02] <marzedwin> Don't feel it, taste it Pat
[2:37:05] <Tuskor13> TIGER! Tiger!
[2:37:05] <Valask> I'm glad people are salty, better than a lukewarm grand final
[2:37:13] <+harris2210> Maybe use vskill to stop fireball
[2:37:23] <$Sayie> Why can't Pat just be good at this game he hasn't touched in maybe months Kappa
[2:37:23] <RAAAAAINMAKER> walk back and stay full screen against a zoner.... brave strat
[2:37:27] <+Crippl3> @Valask dude it was fucking hype, sonicfox beat 2 SHENRONS
[2:37:28] <Valask> THEY NEVER SEE THE CROUCHING SWEEP COMING
[2:37:29] <+Psyco6> DBFZ is the only game he's good at that has a big player base,the other games he plays dont
[2:37:30] <ikea_recliner> @Crippl3 "Super Dead", ok
[2:37:37] <+Tapt58> Grand final was hype, everything you could hope for
[2:37:37] <Flyrant> SonicFox's ability to win scrambles as well as his offensive pressure are just gdlk. You can't discredit him for that no matter how much you try
[2:37:42] <%Keyd00d> FUCK IT
[2:37:43] <+Weeewer> LOL

[2:39:19] <%bevyrage> yeah low rush should be a good follow-up to the command grab unless it can't cancel from recovery frames

[2:45:51] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I missed a perfect?! Dang it! That's what I get for PLAYING SFV, instead of WATCHING SFV!!!
[2:45:51] <AncelDeLambert> I swear, Pat, if you had choked that....

[2:46:14] <SquiglyBattleOpera> @Tapt58 Pad is a fine option for playing fightgames (pad players myself), but if you really really want to use a stick I would recommend the Drone
[2:46:14] <+MONSTRx_x> atpFeelsBeardMan
[2:46:15] <+operator_san> @chozo_55 right i go to get water come back and i see a perfect on the board lol
[2:46:17] <+sayaman012341> Canadian Gatekeepers
[2:46:17] <+th3madness> I've only scraped super silver at my best
[2:46:18] <BakerBrute> @Tapt58 To my understanding, people only use sticks because its what they grew up with. Use whatever is comfortable
[2:46:20] <WackyXmand> Tooooo much work honestly
[2:46:22] <+StrangeCoincidence> Evo is for lovers
[2:46:23] <WallStGerbil> TWO MONTHS FROM SOULCALIBUR VI GET HYPE
[2:46:24] <CountMeowingtonn> ROAD TO GOLD
[2:46:24] <@SSaryn> Gold is where the Killers start to ERUPT OUT OF THE PLACE.

[2:46:38] <StrikeTheErf> back HP is good anti-air
[2:46:39] <NonAddictiveSlurm> @angriestpat so, about that Guilty Gear X2 fisticuffs your going arent going to do
[2:46:40] <%ssjklyco> Dodge
[2:46:41] <%SuperCasualBoom> Pat’s V-Trigger 1: Crazy Talk, V-Trigger 2: I Can’t Stop Jumping!!!
[2:46:42] <+Worldbrand> intentionally drop your combos and run away to unnerve your opponent
[2:46:43] <+OnTheDonner> I sit at super bronze and silver
[2:46:45] <+StrangeCoincidence> stop doing the mike ross
[2:46:45] <Copperama> At the same time, I hear sticks are good for wrist problems...
[2:46:47] <GreatestGuess> Jump more.
[2:46:47] <Mr_Strut> Gain skills
[2:46:50] <@StridentSong> Use joystick movements and button combinations to perform special moves
[2:46:50] <+SagatAteMyCornFlakes> Suffer like G did Pat
[2:46:52] <Sochin_Iitsu> How do I steal Woolie's apartment, stuff, and girl?
[2:46:53] <$Sayie> @AngriestPat Play more!
[2:46:54] <CountMeowingtonn> Stop randomly giving up pressure when they're in the corner
[2:46:55] <%finaltrinity5> how the fuck does anyone have good day 0.5 g tech lmao
[2:46:56] <+MONSTRx_x> watch streams of good players
[2:47:00] <WackyXmand> The rush move looks really good for characters who try to wall like Sagat.
[2:47:03] <%bevyrage> @AngriestPat chop to low kick looks like a good pressure and poke check on block
[2:47:03] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I got to silver once, then I got stomped back into bronze, and I've never recovered
[2:47:04] <+SaurianCrash> Get G Pat, you can only Get G with G V:
[2:47:04] <@Pandora_Prime> Trufax
[2:47:11] <umm_idunno> @AngriestPat b+hard punch canceld into qcf hard kick is a good anti air
[2:47:16] <Mr_Strut> Lots of people never get DP, pat. Don't worry.
[2:47:17] <StrikeTheErf> @AngriestPat might be canceling it too fast honestly, I had that problem
[2:47:18] <+sayaman012341> @Sochin_Iitsu Beat him in melty blood
[2:47:19] <+StrangeCoincidence> Can deaf people cry?
[2:47:21] <%finaltrinity5> clean up your execution you trash goblin
[2:47:26] <+OnTheDonner> Desk has good day 0.5 G tech
[2:47:30] <RAAAAAINMAKER> Like only 2.5% of PS4 players have the Make Gold Rank achievement
[2:47:30] <jojopizzapasta> pretty sure standing medium punch cannot be special cancelled
[2:47:35] <+chozo_55> @angriestpat Only Crouching Medium Punch is cancelable.
[2:47:36] <Saturdaythe14th> max level kick is safe on block
[2:47:37] <Aleate> Woolie? PogChamp Kappa
[2:47:39] <MainMan_Jonadiah> A Nickely?!?
[2:47:39] <%bevyrage> they don't have invincibility BUT THE LOW PUNCH DODGES HIGH?

[2:47:53] <+StrangeCoincidence> Devon the legend
[2:47:54] <%IKilledADeadGuy> You get a lot of crush counter HPs so I suggest trying to hit confirm those into the dp
[2:47:55] <%HanPaul> Turn this man into goo
[2:48:01] <+MONSTRx_x> wools on stream
[2:48:05] <editorsebas> crouching medium punch can be special cancelled
[2:48:05] <CountMeowingtonn> goo this man pat
[2:48:11] <+VanaSkiller> Oh look Max is on, bye Pat
[2:48:13] <%finaltrinity5> woolie plays blanka dont front
[2:48:14] <Copperama> Oh, it's the villain of Street FIghter Fi- Ahahaha... nevermind, what a joke
[2:48:15] <WackyXmand> Hmm. I don't have much experience just going off from what i've seen so far. I would say less jumping more rush ins.
[2:48:16] <+kinghats> All of your specials are negative by at least -4
[2:48:16] <Clinnamon> just a reminder that Necalli is the biggest jobber in the story mode
[2:48:18] <JuniperWizard> DEVOUR OUR HOUR
[2:48:19] <%Keyd00d> devou
[2:48:20] <APsaull> Crouch m.p can be cancelled
[2:48:20] <editorsebas> you're supposed to link standing medium to crouching medium
[2:48:25] <+kukadin> Why's Q look all weird
[2:48:26] <+SaurianCrash> heh
[2:48:29] <+Crippl3> dude nekali looks so fuckin cool
[2:48:31] <NonAddictiveSlurm> granny swamp coming in for the job
[2:48:32] <%finaltrinity5> is he even the villain? or is he just a random ass 3rd party
[2:48:32] <%SuperCasualBoom> Necalli...yeah I remember that dude...
[2:48:35] <%Higgsworth> Take my money and dance for me, funny man.
[2:48:40] <+th3madness> what is this dude doing
[2:48:42] <jojopizzapasta> stand medium punch combos into crouch medium punch which is in fact special cancelable
[2:48:44] <Copperama> I forgot Nac even existed...
[2:48:46] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Necalli's the fuckin' coolest! It's a shame Capcom apparently disagrees.
[2:48:46] <%SaltyDongs> Slobber knocker
[2:48:46] <DesDavis> i dont like playing tall characters because it makes me insecure
[2:48:48] <+sayaman012341> Does woolie EVER stream?
[2:48:50] <+th3madness> I am dying inside
[2:48:53] <+chozo_55> As someone playing G in plat. It's hell. I'll tell ya.
[2:48:54] <JuniperWizard> @kukadin I think he looks like a G...I’ll leave
[2:48:56] <%finaltrinity5> @sayaman012341 no
[2:49:02] <%Remery_> No but if he did it would just be mostly Kirby
[2:49:05] <%HanPaul> Neccali is some weird as Neutral Evil noname
[2:49:09] <+StrangeCoincidence> I legit don't know the character Pat is playing, I thought it was Cody but the proportions are wrong
[2:49:13] <Clinnamon> he tries to set himself up to be a villain eating people's souls, except he loses to everyone
[2:49:21] <+Crippl3> @StrangeCoincidence G, just came olut today
[2:49:22] <Mr_Strut> He's blanka now?
[2:49:22] <+sayaman012341> I wouldnt even be mad about that. Kirby is dope
[2:49:22] <+FlamingNarwhal> @StrangeCoincidence it's G
[2:49:23] <+Crippl3> *out
[2:49:25] <+th3madness> vtrigger makes that safe
[2:49:25] <+StrangeCoincidence> ooh
[2:49:28] <sanslogic> noodle time
[2:49:29] <%finaltrinity5> how is G's synergy with Base Goku and Lei Wulong?
[2:49:29] <+Weeewer> Its his VT2
[2:49:30] <+th3madness> Season 2 change
[2:49:36] <umm_idunno> @AngriestPat punish with *** and lk
[2:49:42] <RAAAAAINMAKER> yeah its new his projectile
[2:49:42] <+th3madness> boy this necalli is ass
[2:49:43] <$Metal_Slime_King> b
[2:49:43] <WackyXmand> Hmm i thought G had like a punch forward or something.
[2:49:45] <%SuperCasualBoom> Necalli have them ropes on his head I see at fitness workout centers
[2:49:45] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @StrangeCoincidence He's playing G, new character that just came out today along side Sagat.
[2:49:48] <+th3madness> raw discs guidances
[2:49:52] <AncelDeLambert> CHOKE
[2:49:52] <+th3madness> just throwing shit out
[2:49:53] <Revenantreaver> hey teleporting is fcheating necalli
[2:49:54] <+NWR_James> thats a good button
[2:49:55] <+StrangeCoincidence> noo not sagat
[2:49:57] <%IKilledADeadGuy> Oh god the lag
[2:50:13] <+SoftButtCheeks> Bruh
[2:50:14] <%finaltrinity5> necalli's character design is top tier, his vtrigger activation might be my favorite design of sfv
[2:50:16] <NonAddictiveSlurm> @finaltrinity5 not very good, from an entirely different franchise Kappa
[2:50:16] <MainMan_Jonadiah> @StrangeCoincidence Yeah, I know how ya feel.
[2:50:17] <+Crippl3> put in the bus lmao
[2:50:23] <%HanPaul> back o the bus.
[2:50:24] <+th3madness> >urp
[2:50:25] <+rorschachsjournal505> They need to introduce a new net code to this game....FAST
[2:50:27] <+th3madness> HAHAHAHAHA
[2:50:32] <%Remery_> The Shame Bus
[2:50:36] <%finaltrinity5> @nonaddictiveslurm that's not stopping tekken sajamSegue2
[2:50:36] <Valask> how's it feel to lose to the bad character that woolie thinks is cool
[2:50:41] <+StrangeCoincidence> isnt this p2p though?
[2:50:48] <+th3madness> necalli can't handle the taste of G
[2:50:52] <%finaltrinity5> sajamSaint never forget my man saint didnt make top 8
[2:50:53] <count_bob> So uh. Is SF3 still canon?
[2:50:54] <Sochin_Iitsu> Connection Johns
[2:50:55] <+yomachaser> GQ tag team when?
[2:50:57] <+FrostedZaibatsu> new net code LUL
[2:50:57] <GreatestGuess> Rematch if WiFi warriors NotLikeThis
[2:50:59] <+Crippl3> @Valask I don't know if he's good but this is the first time I've seen him and he is cool
[2:51:08] <Delror> @count_bob SF3 is after this
[2:51:09] <Clinnamon> SF3 is still canon, SFV takes place before it
[2:51:13] <AncelDeLambert> Woolie thinks this Baki reject is cool?
[2:51:18] <count_bob> Just checking.
[2:51:20] <NonAddictiveSlurm> @finaltrinity5 all we need is Thannos and Stanley from the Stanley Parable and Season 2 is complete LUL
[2:51:25] <JuniperWizard> @angriestpat not joking have you tried rushing in more? I feel like G has a lot of “start up” that would be covered by rushing in and putting in constant combo pressure.
[2:51:28] <@Pandora_Prime> What you didn't know Necali has 0-frame instant transmission?
[2:51:29] <%finaltrinity5> for all who dont know, G's v trigger is called MAXIMUM PRESIDENT
[2:51:30] <Valask> @Crippl3 I'm just talking about his moves
[2:51:33] <Clinnamon> I think the story might eventually progress to retcon some of 3 though
[2:51:35] <+yomachaser> Is there a safe way to president levels yet?
[2:51:36] <prettypatties97> He would be cooler if he didn't job super hard in the story mode
[2:51:36] <count_bob> I'm trying to brush up on my SF lore and SF3 seems to be...rather depressing.
[2:51:43] <+OnTheDonner> @Crippl3 He's president of Earth
[2:51:43] <+MONSTRx_x> PANDA PLAYERS THOUGH
[2:51:44] <%finaltrinity5> @nonaddictiveslurm sajamWut
[2:51:48] <Valask> uh
[2:51:49] <MainMan_Jonadiah> Necalli's covered in "V's," everything pointed to him being the big-bad of sfV, but then Capcom just made him boring, even though it was the easiest slam dunk possible
[2:51:51] <AlasterAngelo> tekken 7 dlc thanos from fortnite where he dabs
[2:51:53] <frankyxm> what a game this is
[2:52:00] <Valask> man you guys both suck
[2:52:03] <%IKilledADeadGuy> @yomachaser You get them after ending combos
[2:52:05] <WackyXmand> Hmm i thought he had a rush in move. Guess I was thinking of the V trigger.
[2:52:09] <+th3madness> this dude is just doing all the moves
[2:52:09] <Valask> like that Tekken grand final
[2:52:10] <NonAddictiveSlurm> @frankyxm Clay Fighters 5
[2:52:13] <KillJayKill> still hate this game?
[2:52:14] <%SuperCasualBoom> This Necalli player connection needs a....REBOOT!!! 😎
[2:52:15] <%finaltrinity5> this game had like 90k less viewers than dbfz grand finals
[2:52:19] <SsHomes> lol salty
[2:52:20] <%finaltrinity5> feelsbadman
[2:52:21] <+yomachaser> @IKilledADeadGuy Oh THX
[2:52:32] <Valask> @SuperCasualBoom boo this man
[2:52:35] <umm_idunno> sfv was on a midnight though
[2:52:35] <+Crippl3> only 40k less from what I saw
[2:52:42] <+MONSTRx_x> go pat give him that salty run back
[2:52:42] <AlasterAngelo> because this game is much less exciting than dbfz
[2:52:47] <Clinnamon> the top 8 was pretty late at night
[2:52:50] <+Crippl3> PogChamp
[2:52:50] <+th3madness> nice

[2:53:08] <%PatNTheHat> +1 to self-esteem for Pat
[2:53:10] <WackyXmand> Yeah I was thinking of the V trigger for rush in.
[2:53:10] <AncelDeLambert> now take your ball and go home
[2:53:11] <KillJayKill> pat could not give two shits
[2:53:14] <KillJayKill> lol
[2:53:15] <+th3madness> G's lines are the best
[2:53:15] <+MONSTRx_x> PLAY FOREVER
[2:53:18] <+yomachaser> G looks amazing IMO
[2:53:19] <+Crippl3> Time to go out on top

[2:53:28] <+kinghats> @admiral_of_crunch hes FANG TIER but cool
[2:53:31] <%ssjklyco> You should just play someone in chat just to get an easy win
[2:53:34] <admiral_of_crunch> Rad
[2:53:36] <Partrap> Is G related to Q if so how?
[2:53:38] <%finaltrinity5> yeah dbfz goes so late that I think 3/5 dbfz is wack
[2:53:45] <AncelDeLambert> Pat... you were done. FOR WHAT REASON?!
[2:53:50] <Valask> why do people fret so much about EVO viewership numbers if all games were 150k+?
[2:53:52] <%bevyrage> they're both rounded letters with a sharp bit on 'em
[2:53:54] <prettypatties97> I'd be willing to get bodied by Pat, but I would first need to actually buy the game
[2:53:55] <%SuperCasualBoom> @valask Can I switch boos? I prefer them the left side. 😬

[2:56:50] <@thenefftw> You could've ended it on a win
[2:56:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> !uptime
[2:56:52] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 56m 54s.
[2:56:53] <Valask> please keep going
[2:56:56] <%finaltrinity5> shout outs to Lost Soul, repping USA for Guilty Gear?
[2:56:58] <Chumblago13> that feels bad.
[2:57:00] <+LogothX> Its not Jons, the game ADDS ARTIFICIAL DELAY
[2:57:01] <WackyXmand> This match up was working for Pat since Nicalli has to get in close and all of G's normals have good range.
[2:57:04] <%IKilledADeadGuy> Should’ve winquit on this laggy bs
[2:57:05] <prettypatties97> That lag was atrocious
[2:57:06] <+RenoDeGeneric> Rollback can totally be one sided
[2:57:06] <cerberuscarmine> rip
[2:57:09] <$Bncbck> its real bad
[2:57:10] <+StrangeCoincidence> it's online
[2:57:11] <+RenoDeGeneric> You ain't crazy
[2:57:16] <Caivyre> hard johns
[2:57:16] <%Jorgon_Skylisk> Its bad
[2:57:17] <jojopizzapasta> that lag looked fuckin rough
[2:57:20] <+StrangeCoincidence> online garbo
[2:57:21] <@SSaryn> evoUSA G for 2020 evoUSA
[2:57:21] <Valask> what is crazy is john?
[2:57:22] <%MeowFyre> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[2:57:23] <%SuperCasualBoom> Nope
[2:57:25] <Clinnamon> yeah sometimes the other person sees something pretty different
[2:57:28] <%IKilledADeadGuy> Both johns and understandable
[2:57:28] <Daxalog> There was a video explaining it. On his end it could be nothing.
[2:57:29] <NonAddictiveSlurm> DSPat johns LUL
[2:57:29] <Chumblago13> Lets he supportive and encouraging to Pat. like actually
[2:57:33] <%finaltrinity5> rollback can def be one sided
[2:57:34] <SquiglyBattleOpera> This game's netcode is mad fucked so you can have one sided rollback where one guy lags but not the other
[2:57:35] <+OnTheDonner> I really love SFV theme song now
[2:57:36] <JuniperWizard> No that lag was a problem
[2:57:37] <%badchoice5> I WANT it to be johns, but no, that's shit
[2:57:39] <%RubberFistFight> No, he straight-up wasn't where you were aiming your punches, like, the game was just putting him back or forward whenever needed
[2:57:44] <%RubberFistFight> the fireballs made that obvious
[2:57:45] <+RenoDeGeneric> A dude recently made a vid breaking it down, I can go find it if you'd like
[2:57:49] <Caivyre> the johns are increasing every second
[2:57:51] <Copperama> This is exactly why I oppose roll back, cause this is exactly what I was thinking it was going to be.
[2:57:53] <%finaltrinity5> I just choose training stage and never crossplay
[2:57:54] <Clinnamon> Cyclops Cammy PogChamp
[2:57:55] <%goose_attack_almanac> oh no she's hot
[2:57:57] <bragokingeternal> that's how the net code works the better internet gets all the rollback
[2:57:57] <@SSaryn> Man, Cammy's battle outfit is still amazing.
[2:57:58] <Valask> Brunette cammy Kreygasm

[2:58:21] <SatansDick1> cyclops cammie??
[2:58:22] <NonAddictiveSlurm> does this cammy have pants
[2:58:22] <%MeowFyre> do you guys think G just folds up his beard over and over so it fits under his mask
[2:58:25] <JuniperWizard> Best cammy, hot damn
[2:58:25] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat like, you aimed a fireball at him, but all of a sudden he was like 2 feet back without moving through the intervening space. Shit was dodgy.
[2:58:27] <StrikeTheErf> as in you get rolled back
[2:58:30] <+Crippl3> oh my god she IS cyclops

[2:58:36] <%SuperCasualBoom> It basically Cyclops Cammy so Pat gonna love beating this up this one.
[2:58:37] <+chozo_55> My connections only ever mess up maybe 2/10 matches. Does that mean the other person is having a bad match?
[2:58:45] <Mr_Strut> He's mastered Plague's technique of lag combat.

[2:59:06] <+gwanzan> what does that "one Earth" move do?
[2:59:07] <%RubberFistFight> is that a fucking Cyclops Cammy?
[2:59:13] <MainMan_Jonadiah> I usually have good matches on SFV... But when it's bad, this game is UNPLAYABLE!!!
[2:59:17] <%MeowFyre> @Stol3nheart oh fuck thats strong
[2:59:18] <+clack14> sometimes I get connections with canda actually
[2:59:28] <%finaltrinity5> yeah when sfv connection is bad it is BAAAAAAAD
[2:59:29] <+Crippl3> I mean, if they aren't gonna put cyclops in MvC, might as well put him in SF
[2:59:31] <Clinnamon> yeah I get good matches like 7/10 times. The other times, its horrendous
[2:59:33] <+yomachaser> @gwanzan2 It raises his president level so his specials improve
[2:59:35] <Valask> most games are unplayable with lag though

[2:59:45] <+chozo_55> Cammy needs pants like a blind person needs glasses.
[2:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
