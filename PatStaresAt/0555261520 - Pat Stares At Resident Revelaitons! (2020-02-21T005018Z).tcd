[0:02:37] <%theotherkristian> I want Megan Man
[0:02:42] <%D3rrtyD4n> its all prep for re6 atpRtsd
[0:02:43] <%SirGO0SE> psaDab
[0:02:48] <%happyface699> I too want a megan
[0:02:51] <%C0baltCrusade> I was going to say "we got past most of the bad ones" but then remembered, "oh no, after this is 6"
[0:02:54] <%JZPotter> Revelations is one of the worst subtitles ever. It's so gimmick-y and overused
[0:02:57] <%Stuzilla21> psaBlep
[0:02:58] <%xUmbraNinja> I’m ready for that phat ass psaDab
[0:03:00] <etnoika> Wait does this mean they'll do REvelations 2 coop later?
[0:03:05] <%D3rrtyD4n> im looking forward to re6 tho
[0:03:06] <Pwgregory> Revelations. Resident Evil with 89 percent less ethnic cleansing!
[0:03:07] <%SoFarFetched> Probably
[0:03:13] <%SoFarFetched> He's definitely not doing this one co-op
[0:03:20] <%happyface699> They definitely won’t get to rev 2
[0:03:20] <%SirGO0SE> RE6 is the one I've been looking forward to the most
[0:03:22] <%SoFarFetched> wait I mean RE6 he's not
[0:03:24] <%C0baltCrusade> im starting to think there might not be time, even if we only do one campaign of re6
[0:03:25] <%mMayrro> He's doing this one blind isn't he
[0:03:32] <%D3rrtyD4n> @SirGO0SE for reals
[0:03:41] <%JZPotter> Leon's campaign of RE 6 is alright
[0:03:41] <%happyface699> No he’s played a lot of this
[0:03:55] <Shonen_hero> That RE6 playthrough sounds like it's gonna be a slog. Pity for Pat
[0:03:55] <%AmericanaRed> oh shiiiiiii
[0:03:55] <%marvel877> Will we find out the fate of a one PeachSaliva after her attempt to become a skeleton from eating pineapple?
[0:03:59] <%D3rrtyD4n> nobody plays re6, so its gonna be like "wtf is this game?" atpRtsd
[0:04:00] <%linSP> is this better than 6
[0:04:00] <%DensityD> panicBasket panicBasket panicBasket panicBasket panicBasket panicBasket panicBasket panicBasket panicBasket panicBasket panicBasket panicBasket panicBasket
[0:04:02] <%SoFarFetched> yeah he's played them,its more of how much did he forget or remember.
[0:04:02] <%Alpha8087> AW HERE WE GO
[0:04:04] <%happyface699> @jzpotter Until the last few hrs which is absolute shit
[0:04:10] <%j0ustar> Revelations was dumb but fun at least
[0:04:14] <alliudmla> Re6 is so much better than both Revelations
[0:04:17] <%JZPotter> @happyface699 You're not even wrong.
[0:04:20] <TwistyReptile> Hi, guys! First time watcher. c:
[0:04:21] <%C0baltCrusade> I feel like Leon's campaign of RE6 is the most like older RE games but as a result lacks the total stupidity of the other campaigns which makes it more lackluster
[0:04:22] <Pwgregory> Hope Paige is doing a lot better today...
[0:04:23] <Shonen_hero> Any of the two Revelation games are better then 6
[0:04:25] <~PatStaresAt> alliu you are fucking insane
[0:04:26] <%xUmbraNinja> psaGib
[0:04:26] <iamnotaparrot> crazy how between the 2 resident evil games released in 2012, the 3DS spinoff was the better one than the ps3/360 numbered title
[0:04:32] <KeiPrime> RE6 doesn't have Grinder and Jackass, i'll just leave that bit of info
[0:04:40] <alliudmla> dude, i'm gonna be RE6 apologist forever
[0:04:45] <seniortrump> WHERE IS HELENA
[0:04:46] <%Alpha8087> @PatStaresAt Yeah that sounds about right.
[0:04:47] <%D3rrtyD4n> @PatStaresAt we'll see about that atpCap
[0:04:50] <alliudmla> had a lot o fun with it (despite it's flaws)
[0:04:53] <%General_Terro> psaDab psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[0:04:57] <MichaelOGCleaver> you guys hear that? sounds like Pat had a seizure
[0:04:57] <%JZPotter> I did actually like Helena.
[0:04:58] <+SlappyMeats> Leon's campain in RE6 STARTS ok, but then rapidly degenerates into dull nonsense then culminates in some real bullshit with the Simmons fight
[0:05:01] <%happyface699> @patstaresat Pat I’m on your side don’t worry, I also hate rev 1 even though it’s a fine game
[0:05:02] <%StaceMcGate> Paige and Pineapple, name a more iconic duo
[0:05:09] <%mMayrro> RE spin off with Helena and Sheva fucking when psaDab

[0:05:15] <%spiritofmojave> REVALAYATONS
[0:05:17] <%C0baltCrusade> dont you remember iconic resident evil villain, Senator Derek C. Simmons????
[0:05:17] <%TheDullaMAN> Pat and CHocolate Easter Bunny
[0:05:21] <%JZPotter> @mMayrro I would actually dig that
[0:05:29] <%happyface699> REVALAYATONS LETS GO
[0:05:32] <cochramd1992> EAT THE BUNNY PAT
[0:05:35] <alliudmla> @PatStaresAt are you gonna do Raid Mode per chance?
[0:05:35] <KeiPrime> man all those simmons transformations eachone would make a cool final boss, but together its like theres 3 forms too many
[0:05:37] <%JZPotter> @C0baltCrusade DON'T FUCK WITH THIS SENATOR
[0:05:39] <%spiritofmojave> yeyeye
[0:05:50] <KeiPrime> bone tiger, bone trex, giant fly
[0:05:50] <%D3rrtyD4n> we might yet look at re6 with eyes unclouded by hate

[0:07:27] <%EndlessScrapper> I've never actually played or even looked at the first revelations

[0:08:33] <etnoika> God I still hate how RE7 is canon to the rest of the series. it feels so dumb. It's the one time in history that a reboot would have been better.

[0:16:35] <%rytyoung> WHUT
[0:16:37] <%Sir_stride> Basically
[0:16:38] <%chambatron> You can only have 1 download of the back ever and then it's fucking gone
[0:16:38] <%MoonObscure> mew
[0:16:39] <%krawtch> Nintendo is like a boomer and think the internet is just a passing fad

[0:16:56] <%marvel877> They also don't do cloud saves for Splatoon, either.
[0:16:57] <Royalguard22> That's not true

[0:17:11] <@commanderclaw> commanderclaw subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 25 month streak! I've been playing Pathfinder: Kingmaker, and even in it's current state, it's still buggy and unfriendly with multi monitor setups. It's also kind of frustrating structurally. Imagine a CRPG with an XCOM 2 style Doom Clock. Only play if desperate for CRPG

[0:17:28] <DrkJP520> What a bunch of fucking nonsense
[0:17:28] <reonome> theres 1 cloud save lmao
[0:17:28] <%Alpha8087> PAT DETECTIVE TIME
[0:17:30] <+goldenwerewolf> You get one personal copy of your cloud save unless you eat nintendo's ass
[0:17:31] <cochramd1992> oh boy, more podcast material
[0:17:31] <mobiusnightshade> Thanks, I hate it. :)
[0:17:32] <%skizzuto> There WILL be cloud saves....implemented sometime after launch
[0:17:33] <etnoika> Ehy
[0:17:38] <%valriot> I dont think ive ever used cloud saves in like 10 years, people just like losing their shit over nothing
[0:17:38] <%mMayrro> THANKS DOUG BOWSER
[0:17:39] <iamnotaparrot> it has 1 local save and it's switch unit dependent, not user dependant. so if 2 people want to play AC you need 2 switches
[0:17:39] <%spiritofmojave> ONE GUY IS A VERIFIED SOURCE
[0:17:40] <reonome> who the fuck said there wasn't local
[0:17:40] <%connos_procrastination> animal crossing more like...shit
[0:17:40] <%XeroSigmaPrime> IT HAS LOCAL, NO CLOUD EXCEPT THE ONE CLOUD SAVE
[0:17:44] <%logoth_> Resetti is keeping us down
[0:17:45] <jerocus> That sounds sooo stupid
[0:17:45] <%rytyoung> but only one save slot?
[0:17:45] <etnoika> Why are they so bad at online God!
[0:17:46] <DavidSanChan> when you die in the game you die irl
[0:17:47] <%Helmed> @PatStaresAt every animal crossing had a dupe method with save games. nintendo going in HARD
[0:17:50] <%Calek> @commanderclaw yeah I loved Pathfinder Kingmaker until I got to the kingdom management, it was way too much at once
[0:17:51] <%krawtch> if you need 2 backups you gotta sell ass to Tom Nook
[0:17:54] <%jorniev> YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE!?
[0:17:56] <%ssjklyco> the rocks behind Pat is a green screen. h
[0:17:59] <Bailey__gaming> Sherlock Pat and Doctor Peach Watson
[0:18:00] <%spiritofmojave> where's Resetti
[0:18:00] <%cvp5127> gotta pay up for extra slot Kappa
[0:18:01] <%BalloniWright> @fairore this one
[0:18:09] <reonome> 1 save slot is pretty standard for AC
[0:18:13] <ShoMibu> Were going to get to the point were more saves slots = more money. Then well talk about the good ole days of having +8 saves and such.
[0:18:16] <Royalguard22> Eh, it's okay
[0:18:19] <DrkJP520> It's a pretty fun game
[0:18:20] <%rytyoung> I played rev 1 on the 3ds my first time too!

[0:18:36] <Royalguard22> Pat, remember when you liked the Nintendo 2DS? Me too.
[0:18:38] <%connos_procrastination> doom eternal has many saves play that instead
[0:18:39] <%j0ustar> Now Pat will see Jill in 4k taking the whole screen

[0:18:41] <%pectusumbra> wait, is this NOT the co-op one you've already played in the past?
[0:18:43] <%rytyoung> yeah I got a circle pad pro for it and it helped alot
[0:18:48] <%OwlLightningMage> Does Pat hate handhelds because they are short?
[0:18:48] <$shadow1man9> 3DS had a bunch of good games on it at least
[0:18:50] <%fairore> @balloniwright mmmmm doubt but how did come that conclusion?
[0:18:51] <%D3rrtyD4n> is it all fucked up?

[0:18:57] <%fairore> fuck
[0:18:59] <Shonen_hero> I think Pathfinder King Maker modded is a pretty good experience, but the kingdom management does suck. Lesson I learned? Never build anything but dice dice roll boosting buildings or teleportation circles. All other building are a waste in investment

[0:39:07] <%kingbaconcrispy> I like the fact that Pat will never let go of the typo in revelations. Certain gags never die. At least that's one thing that wasn't outlived by DSP
[0:39:07] <derekwst3> this is why you feed the stray cats on your neighbors lawns

[0:39:45] <%Xooler67> @bevyrage agreed, pat keeps her sane
[0:39:50] <ShoMibu> Maybe they need to put the litter in the basement where he peed, but then i bet elmo still does it to get even LUL
[0:39:51] <+Remery_> the stray cats smelled Elmo's musk on Paige and was desperate to mate

[0:54:12] <%Madbearv> Jill so hot
[0:54:12] <%cdrom321> No. The giant improvement is the size of the dat ass.
[0:54:13] <Firesparks> did all the OROBOS go to her ass?

[0:54:18] <+dmtjinni> Sit on my face plz
[0:54:19] <%ospreyworks> Jill looks like she's having an allergic reaction
[0:54:19] <%TheMattman1313> Why is Michelle Ruff voicing Jill in this game?
[0:54:22] <+goldenwerewolf> Pat can you just pack up against the wall with the camera for like 5-15 minutes
[0:54:22] <+SlumberMan> There is a dodge.
[0:54:22] <%MrDonTacos_> God Bless that ass Kreygasm
[0:54:23] <MrLily> AIM WALKING? POG PogChamp
[0:54:23] <Firesparks> is this before or after re 5?
[0:54:24] <b_ikki> no dodge
[0:54:24] <KeiPrime> its just mashing the stick to dodge
[0:54:25] <KingVantq> @PatStaresAt the dodge in this game is terrible
[0:54:25] <+FrenchTact1cs> calebGasm doodMaxhype calebGasm doodMako
[0:54:25] <%Sir_stride> keep going I'm nearly there
[0:54:26] <+trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt its an re3 dodge
[0:54:26] <AxelCezar> keep the camera low all the time, we want ass
[0:54:27] <%SWFanatic> the blonde hair went to her butt?
[0:54:28] <+Malchiah_Tenabre> That ass is going sink the boat.
[0:54:28] <%KeystoneA1> the dodge is....tempermental
[0:54:28] <lukegv> super thicc Jill is my favorite
[0:54:29] <munchkay> DAMN DEM CHEEKS!!
[0:54:31] <+Remery_> Scott Stiener would be proud
[0:54:31] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> I remember when AH Michael played this and Monty showed up FeelsBadMan
[0:54:33] <%baronblank> if you press forward before being hit you dodge
[0:54:34] <Royalguard22> Booty booty booty booty rockin everywhere!
[0:54:34] <SulfurousAcid> Dodge is forward or quick turn before getting hit
[0:54:35] <%ssjklyco> the 3ds adds 10lbs to the ass
[0:54:35] <%TheActuallyGuy> Parker looks like a Saint Bernard.
[0:54:36] <dabirSA> giant improvement, yeah you already mentioned her ass
[0:54:36] <%PauliusMaximus> play tank coward
[0:54:36] <%Dragon_Batman> If there is one they would have a tutorial no?
[0:54:37] <DrkJP520> Flick the stick to dodge when you're attacked
[0:54:38] <$lotharrio> Revelay-atons.
[0:54:39] <DeaconTNR> I remember a RE3 style doge
[0:54:39] <KeiPrime> its more like re3 dodging?
[0:54:39] <+luketrapwalker> JILL GOT DEM YEEKS
[0:54:39] <R3c0n31> IT GOT DODGE
[0:54:40] <%GalacticaPhanto> Blessed be that ass Jill
[0:54:40] <+professormorrigan> I found the dodge confusing in this game
[0:54:41] <%baronblank> there's a tutorial later on the dodge
[0:54:41] <+Toblo1> @PatStaresAt Thre *IS* a dodge, but its very finicky
[0:54:42] <%Helmed> @PatStaresAt its got an RE3 QTE dodge
[0:54:42] <DeaconTNR> dodge
[0:54:42] <ShoMibu> You know people always say "Sit on my face" But i don't think you know how that feels on a bony ass. IT HURTS!
[0:54:42] <%Ziegsy> So thats FAR too shiny to be a simple wet suit, think its rubber? and if so think shes squeakin?
[0:54:42] <%krawtch> this game has dodges but you have to press a direction when you are about to be hit. Sort of like RE3 dodges.
[0:54:43] <%SolidusRex> You think this ass is big now, imagine this ass in glorious 3D popping out at you
[0:54:44] <jerocus> There is a dodge but you can’t have weapon ready to do it
[0:54:44] <%connos_procrastination> PORNO JILL
[0:54:44] <spacechannel4> Dodge is parry like pat
[0:54:46] <%Modren83> You can dodge by pushing up right before getting hit
[0:54:47] <Zaphire_Saucypants> there IS a dodge, but it's situational based on attack
[0:54:49] <Shonen_hero> Jill's cheeks are dummy thicc. She's gonna get caught for sure
[0:54:49] <%linSP> i cant see the rest of jill its ALL ass

[0:55:06] <%tiaramaki> LUL

[1:00:07] <Monkeyweed21> WHAT A GOOD IDEA
[1:00:08] <%j0ustar> Jill's ass in this game is literally 20% of the screen at all times
[1:00:09] <%Dragon_Batman> I wonder if she was featured in the magazine copy of Gigantic asses

[1:00:46] <HeroSolaire> not molded
[1:00:46] <Aydarkzero> i always thought these enemies looked stupid
[1:00:46] <+RenoDeGeneric> These designs are better than the molded
[1:00:47] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Looks like the molded
[1:00:48] <%marvel877> Nah, this is more interesting than the molded.
[1:00:49] <biomegabear> REGENERATOR?
[1:00:52] <%bevyrage> god this looks like a bootleg of the RE series what the shit
[1:00:53] <%SWFanatic> looks like xcom 2 faceless

[1:01:05] <%ShichiNoBushi> It's that thing from Pan's Labrynth.
[1:01:05] <+TenguGemini> how important are the revelations games to the lore?
[1:01:06] <Aracon_> that thing was pretty strong
[1:01:08] <hntronium> oh lawd he comin for that booty

[1:01:14] <DareTheJackal> @PatStaresAt Is REV 1 as good as REV 2? Raid Mode is awesome.
[1:01:14] <CrimsonFox777> I impulsively change my gloves at work, how do these people not have gloves here with all the bio-goo!?
[1:01:15] <DeaconTNR> wasn't there damage numbers? or is that only the mercs mode?
[1:01:15] <%logoth_> There might be an option to turn it off
[1:01:15] <%MonsieurHedge> man that default gu nsucks huh
[1:01:16] <+abrupt_abe> 3DS remains
[1:01:16] <Dreigun> @SWFanatic was thinking the same thing
[1:01:17] <+kauze12> I thought claire was in revelations
[1:01:17] <%marvel877> Probably a holdover from the 3DS controls.
[1:01:17] <%Afterman_> it snaps like the original re games do
[1:01:20] <+Skelegroove> These are some real uncanny valley models
[1:01:20] <+CptCreampuff16> why do i remember this game looking way better?
[1:01:20] <%Meidolaon> If you're playing PC, switch to mouse
[1:01:20] <%Ganerumo> the lack of laser sight and hard crosshair really messes with me
[1:01:20] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt can't wait for terigrigia Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:01:22] <alexandrecau> non canonly important

[1:01:24] <%moogleboy1984> why is he so THICC?
[1:01:24] <ha2ken> The crew became goo
[1:01:25] <Royalguard22> Oy, that mouth movement
[1:01:26] <%fallen92x> gotta shoot both arms
[1:01:26] <%kingbaconcrispy> The lock on is aggresive indeed.
[1:01:27] <lloyddboy> WHAT IS THIS LIPSYNCH
[1:01:27] <%StaceMcGate> LEON
[1:01:27] <FreeFuzeIcedTea> man jill's ass is one thing but what about RACHEL
[1:01:28] <Pwgregory> How does that explain the missing crew?
[1:01:29] <%krawtch> she has a really square jaw in this game
[1:01:31] <stranger59> Game over
[1:01:32] <Judeknight> Wow, the faces in this game look bad.
[1:01:34] <%rytisone> turn off auto aim?
[1:01:36] <%ospreyworks> She looks bland as oatmeal
[1:01:36] <Aracon_> why would chris be on a boat???
[1:01:37] <Psych_man13_13> Seriously this makes me think this is a Chinese knockoff Resident Evil game
[1:01:37] <KeiPrime> theres a shitload of guns in this game its pretty cool about that
[1:01:38] <%Afterman_> into the deep cheeks of jill
[1:01:39] <%Mr_Pylon> How many games have the plot be "Find Chris" or "Chris finds someone"
[1:01:39] <trianglehat> can't handle Carlos's hamster cheeks
[1:01:40] <sothatsprettybrutal> what a limp title card
[1:01:41] <Divantae> god I played thid game for the first time recently and hoo boy why
[1:01:41] <HeavyManaBeast2> yup 3ds holdover
[1:01:42] <%SvenHolgersson> the depths of BAD GAME
[1:01:43] <%TheActuallyGuy> why does parker look like a saint Bernard?
[1:01:43] <%mMayrro> ... of Jill's ass
[1:01:45] <%connos_procrastination> i think the chapter structure really hurts this game
[1:01:45] <trulythedude> show balls
[1:01:46] <DareTheJackal> @PatStaresAt Is REV 1 as good as REV 2? Raid Mode is awesome.
[1:01:47] <islandoasis> plays alright, but the weapon customization could have been better
[1:01:47] <%Rngiddion> why was with the ps3 gen and every dude being a slab of beef

[1:09:47] <+Diabetic> I swear Jill sounds like Paige
[1:09:48] <%bevyrage> so that only bursts when you try to scan it, and it damages you from max scan range too
[1:09:48] <%jorniev> great you are infected now
[1:09:49] <%ShichiNoBushi> Scanning is what players liked about Metroid Prime, right?
[1:09:50] <derekwst3> @PatStaresAt you didn't scan the crows
[1:09:52] <ahaegotrigger> the "sub" weapon
[1:09:52] <+Buzzkill983> What if the biogas infected them?
[1:09:52] <%Estuko> I loved Peace Walker, the side missions were a lot of fun
[1:09:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> It's a miracle that I finished this game despite the thalassophobia and the water sections
[1:09:54] <a_c_chirns> oh cool like holy water or crucifix?
[1:09:54] <$lotharrio> @Afterman_ I was just thinking about that.

[1:11:31] <derekwst3> @PatStaresAt all racoon city was a wild party of BOOMERS
[1:11:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> It was a complete fabrication
[1:11:33] <+UrielCobalt> They carpet bombed Tulsa, I could see it
[1:11:34] <+Skelegroove> It was just a random virus and not a bioweapon in any way.
[1:11:34] <%Ran196> the explanation was "My Bad"
[1:11:35] <%StaceMcGate> Conan O'Brien
[1:11:36] <+CptCreampuff16> racoon was covered up
[1:11:37] <%studleydoorite> city voted for Sanders so the DNC nuked it
[1:11:38] <stranger59> Raccoon City fell out a window
[1:11:39] <%kingbaconcrispy> Racoon City was called as a bio chemical attack
[1:11:39] <%OwlLightningMage> Poor Man's Rose
[1:11:39] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> More like Hoax City
[1:11:41] <faithless_zealot> A weather baloon flew into some electrical wires
[1:11:42] <Monkeyweed21> No cares about Montreal

[1:11:44] <%kingbaconcrispy> Operaation terminate basilus
[1:11:45] <Futuretimetraveller> It's a hoax. They were actors
[1:11:45] <%SolidusRex> THE MORMONS DID RACCOON CITY
[1:11:47] <%MelBrooksKA> I thought it was covered up as a nuclear reactor going off
[1:11:47] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt jet fuel can't melt Raccoon City
[1:11:48] <%krawtch> Raccoon City was a fantasy location, like Atlantis or Seattle
[1:11:48] <%inz0mbiac> Racoon City is Fake News
[1:11:48] <%SilverJakler> The RE cast sure do switch Voice Acotrs a lot
[1:11:48] <CrimsonFox777> Raccoon city didn't happen, but we wish it did
[1:11:52] <+CptCreampuff16> wasnt RE6 about how the president was gonna come clean about everything
[1:11:53] <%cureneckbeard> You mean Raccoon Crater?
[1:11:53] <%rytisone> There always was just a giant crater
[1:11:55] <Psych_man13_13> Oh wait, didn’t umbrella cover it up by saying it was a nuclear meltdown @patstaresat
[1:11:57] <%Shacklebox> Alex Jones told everyone raccoon city was all crisis actors
[1:11:57] <leinadtonu> racoon City is on the edge of the flat earth.
[1:11:57] <%NovaKnightmare> RACCOON CITY SURVIVORS ARE SHILLS OF THE GOVERNMENT
[1:11:57] <%connos_procrastination> "we made it up"
[1:11:57] <CrimsonFox777> I can't take these blobs seriously
[1:11:57] <%cureneckbeard> Racoon Lake
[1:11:58] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt how the fuck did Luis know about raccoon city if it wasn't public knowledge
[1:11:59] <Royalguard22> Reccon City = Animal Crossing. Thanks Tom Nook.
[1:12:00] <%MonsieurHedge> Spencer Did Raccoon City
[1:12:00] <%honeyman18> isnt Racoon city like if Chicago got nuked?
[1:12:01] <+Buzzkill983> Isn't 6 about the president telling Leon he is going to tell people what happened at Raccoon City?
[1:12:01] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> sleeping on the boat
[1:12:02] <%MrDonTacos_> raccoon city was an inside joob
[1:12:04] <+Diabetic> It's Biomeat
[1:12:05] <phatballlz54> this game has so much filler it hurts...
[1:12:06] <%Mr_Pylon> Raccoon City was a government op. The main RE characters are all crisis actors
[1:12:08] <s1rcuit> wasn't the official story a reactor failure?
[1:12:10] <+Buzzkill983> And then he dies super hard?
[1:12:11] <%D3rrtyD4n> this is a dumb monster LUL
[1:12:12] <%Afterman_> pat only likes auto-aim in tank control RE
[1:12:12] <$lotharrio> It's like the Simpsons movie. They just used Tom Hanks to say that the Raccoon Crater was always there and you should just enjoy it.
[1:12:15] <%Gogogolem> Racoon city had a spider infestation
[1:12:16] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Luis was a spy, no?
[1:12:17] <ahaegotrigger> can you turn those menu sounds down too
[1:12:22] <+omglmao> this game is so beige
[1:12:24] <stranger59> aim controls?
[1:12:26] <DrkJP520> Maybe aiming controls
[1:12:26] <KeiPrime> can you?
[1:12:26] <%InugamiTheHound> because of Terragrigia the world knows the truth about bio-weapons
[1:12:27] <%Sir_stride> hmm
[1:12:27] <%rytisone> but Luis knows about Raccoon City incident
[1:12:27] <%kingbaconcrispy> No raccoon citry was on the news, it was just claimed as some form of fungus
[1:12:27] <+SlumberMan> Wasn't Revelaitons after 6?

[1:20:28] <+AngelYoumou> Oh, look at this mechanic that was improved in Rev2
[1:20:30] <$PleasantLeech> I played so much of this on my 3ds
[1:20:31] <%olwe123> you start with the samurai Edge
[1:20:34] <biomegabear> the scanning seems fun to me
[1:20:35] <CrimsonFox777> Ok, wtf is this game? We've got blob monsters and meat machines. What's next?
[1:20:37] <%tigerspath> pat can you do the RE Spin in this game?
[1:20:37] <Ultimatefool> This scanning thing makes me despise this game

[1:20:51] <+LeroyOctopus> because 3ds gyroscope
[1:20:51] <SulfurousAcid> it's really useful
[1:20:52] <%OwlLightningMage> This game needs Joe Baker
[1:20:52] <+trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt the one with 8 is jills
[1:20:53] <Psych_man13_13> Gotta use that 3ds tech
[1:20:53] <+SaltySombrero> @Aracon_ tsbLK
[1:20:53] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> the white gun is stronger pat, lower fire rate
[1:20:53] <b_ikki> gotta use those gyro controls
[1:20:55] <hat_under_bread> Because just picking up ammo is too easy.
[1:20:55] <sothatsprettybrutal> this metroid prime ass scanner and map
[1:20:56] <a_c_chirns> scan that glowing key item Kappa
[1:20:58] <stranger59> So you could use the 3DS motion controls

[1:21:01] <Ralfclogs> 3DS 3D

[1:21:36] <Psych_man13_13> Why would they live him up?
[1:21:37] <sothatsprettybrutal> unfortunately they used a door instead of a boulder or he'd be out already
[1:21:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> MASTER OF UNLOCKING, MY ASS
[1:21:40] <%LaughingCatt> These doors are not boulders, thus Chris is powerless
[1:21:41] <%radda343> but she's the master of unlocking
[1:21:43] <Darren716> SHouldnt she be able to pick the lock?
[1:21:44] <Pwgregory> TRAPPED ya dingus!
[1:21:44] <%templar010> But you're the master of unlocking Jill
[1:21:44] <Psych_man13_13> Lube

[1:22:10] <%maskofmichael> It was stupid to begin with
[1:22:11] <%segonian> this is unrealistic. Jill would just will the lock off.

[1:25:01] <%KeystoneA1> @PatStaresAt There is melee, you just have to stagger them. And in this game you can charge your melee attacks for more damage.

[1:25:18] <%tank7013> @PatStaresAt You should be able to cause a big stun for melee. People are saying to shoot their arms which sounds about right from what I can remember
[1:25:20] <%rytyoung> What chat said scan the enemies before killin them for more %
[1:25:22] <ha2ken> How silly it would be to eat something you are clearly remembered you are allergic to
[1:25:22] <Ultimatefool> Nice empty lockers

[1:26:04] <%InugamiTheHound> where's parker, shouldn't he be with you all the time
[1:26:04] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt smaller gun mag=bigger damage number so you using the 12 shot one means you're using the weakest per bullet gun
[1:26:05] <Zaphire_Saucypants> This was actually designed by the same dude who designed teh Spencer Estate. @PatStaresAt
[1:26:05] <%solidousstream> YOU GOTTA KEEP YOUR SHIT SECURE
[1:26:07] <@absolute_weapon> Don't you lock the doors in your house with specialized sword keys, Pat?

[1:26:30] <mobiusnightshade> It's this planet's version of Real Fake Doors.
[1:26:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Terrorists did the Door
[1:26:35] <%KeystoneA1> @PatStaresAt you can charge your melee attacks in this game
[1:26:37] <%OwlLightningMage> This boat is the same Stand made by that monkey

[1:28:52] <%xUmbraNinja> psaBig psaBig psaBig psaDab
[1:28:53] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt smaller amount of bullets held per mag means bigger damage number so you using the 12 shot pistol means you're using the weakest per bullet gun
[1:28:53] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I never bothered with melee in this game.
[1:28:55] <+Toblo1> Because your kick has AoE
[1:28:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[1:28:55] <%Muzzle131> poor Rachel

[1:29:04] <spacechannel4> Knife works too
[1:29:05] <KaseKaizer> but then RE6
[1:29:06] <%bread_assassin> Then she's NOT a survivor.
[1:29:07] <SulfurousAcid> Not really when you get used to it
[1:29:07] <stabbityrabbit> Are these supposed to be barnacle dudes? If that's the case then then what does that make the "tongue"
[1:29:07] <+Toblo1> They made it harder but made it *so much more statisfying*
[1:29:08] <%goose_attack_almanac> NOOO TIDDY CHAN

[1:29:53] <%cureneckbeard> sploosh
[1:29:54] <%MonsieurHedge> EXCEPT THE FAT GUY
[1:29:54] <oniwahoo> People playing this game were big horny

[1:29:57] <%goose_attack_almanac> the giant ass powers her kicks
[1:29:59] <+joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> I like how they widened the FOV and lowered the camera just to show off Jill's sweet ass
[1:30:01] <%SWFanatic> never change japan
[1:30:01] <%tank7013> Now you're getting it. Play it like Dead Space
[1:30:01] <%Dragon_Batman> You wouldn't go on a boat with normal clothing? of course not
[1:30:02] <%SaiyanShoto> And Chris has to be a sexy sailor!
[1:30:04] <%Muzzle131> there's not enough R34 of rachel!

[1:30:05] <%xUmbraNinja> psaBig psaBig
[1:30:05] <%lutefiiisk> even the monsters are wet
[1:30:06] <DuoScratch> god though, it must be super uncomfortable to wear a skin tight suit on the level of it WEDGES PERFECTLY UP YOUR ASS CRACK!!!!!
[1:30:06] <stabbityrabbit> But...why would you make the dead people sexy? It's just kinda gross.
[1:30:07] <+DatGuyJimbo> one of Jessica's outfits later is rediculous
[1:30:08] <%Maids4lyfe> why are hands the weak point?
[1:30:10] <godzookylives> oozing sticky white stuff
[1:30:10] <KeiPrime> man i feel like reinstallin this badboy now
[1:30:10] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> someone was horny for the red head guy. and this disturbs me
[1:30:11] <+CutCombo> 3DS best version Kappa
[1:30:11] <Aracon_> Jill looks mighty fine
[1:30:12] <%ssjklyco> In RE6, Melee is technically OP, but the fucking stamina system
[1:30:12] <+CptCreampuff16> pat just let me beat off to my video games
[1:30:12] <%Jekado> she's make me wet suit!
[1:30:13] <stranger59> 3DS makes people horny
[1:30:14] <%KeystoneA1> Be honest -- you'd all plow Ooze Rachel
[1:30:15] <Monkeyweed21> HOW DID HE FIT IN THERE
[1:30:18] <ammobasket> gotta keep that BIO in there
[1:30:19] <%ScreamLord> Especially with BROWN hair
[1:30:20] <%ospreyworks> There is a highlight on her ass. They put a light on her butt.
[1:30:21] <ha2ken> That laundry came out dirty...
[1:30:21] <TwistedVerse> :ddddddd
[1:30:21] <shandytowne> That’s correct
[1:30:23] <Ultimatefool> WHY WAS HE IN THE LAUNDRY
[1:30:23] <Fenlig> I think he needs atleast another spin cycle :D
[1:30:26] <KeiPrime> ooze rachel even BEtter
[1:30:26] <%MonsieurHedge> why was he just chilling in a washing machine
[1:30:27] <Jolnir> BRRRRRAAAPPPPP
[1:30:30] <sothatsprettybrutal> i see the bsaa has equipped its agents with... ballistics
[1:30:31] <etnoika> You know, it occurs to me that the only reason these enemies are so challenging is because of the limitations on the aiming controls. If you had RE4 Wii controls they would just be moderately ough.
[1:30:34] <%D3rrtyD4n> shoot his floppy arm LUL
[1:30:35] <sellyourselfshort> Well at least we know this monster is clean
[1:30:35] <DrkJP520> Wetsuits, the boat is leaking cum, the monsters have penises coming out their mouths
[1:30:36] <+professormorrigan> I could never dodge reliably why :(
[1:30:38] <%코코꾸라> "I'm washing me and my clothes"
[1:30:39] <@absolute_weapon> Your gun feels like a weak piece of shit unfortunately
[1:30:40] <%MonsieurHedge> is this the sequel to Oven Guy form RE4
[1:30:43] <@absolute_weapon> or sounds like
[1:30:44] <@absolute_weapon> rather
[1:30:45] <seaechiowai> just another day in Japanese game dev life
[1:30:46] <cochramd1992> gooooo
[1:30:47] <%LiveStreamOnyx> LiveStreamOnyx subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 2 month streak!

It's sweeping across the nation...It started in Raccoon City~ Called the Biohazard Turnaround in Japan!
[1:30:51] <%SilverJakler> The wetsuits really do something for me, man
[1:30:51] <KeiPrime> might knock em down it hink
[1:30:51] <%lutefiiisk> goo
[1:30:52] <+Zerodyne90> sound effects are pretty unsatisfying
[1:30:52] <SulfurousAcid> it can make them crawl
[1:30:53] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> yea
[1:30:55] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> makes their legs have bullets in them
[1:30:56] <%cr0wdcontrol> Umbrella Corps when
[1:30:56] <eco419> yes it hurts
[1:30:56] <b_ikki> not sure i always went for the arms
[1:30:57] <%lionandfox21> This is one hell of a phallic nightmare
[1:30:58] <%cr0wdcontrol> jk
[1:31:01] <%KeystoneA1> Doesn't stagger, but it does knock down
[1:31:02] <%Shadowpint> Holy fuck that bottle on the table is so polygonal
[1:31:04] <+joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> It makes you loo stupid, so there's that
[1:31:04] <+trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt btw your using a dlc gun
[1:31:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> Makes their legs hurt?
[1:31:07] <spacechannel4> Yes, fall over
[1:31:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I always went for the head. Never really hurt for ammo in this game, cuz of the scanning.
[1:31:11] <Arek_1> LUL
[1:31:12] <%j0ustar> I mean
[1:31:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> Nope
[1:31:12] <faithless_zealot> LUL
[1:31:13] <sothatsprettybrutal> well first off, the wounds, they will not heal
[1:31:13] <+gryffon95> no
[1:31:15] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the less bullets the gun holds in a mag the more damage each bullet does, so you're using the weakest weapon rn
[1:31:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> that is not inaccurate
[1:31:15] <%cdrom321> @PatStaresAt Do you have to let the button go when charging or is it automatic when it maxes out.
[1:31:17] <%connos_procrastination> If i was a japanese game dev i would simply not be horny
[1:31:18] <%OwlLightningMage> It makes them eat pineapples
[1:31:20] <$PleasantLeech> scan
[1:31:22] <SuperChumps> @PatStaresAt How much would I have to donate for you to play Dead Aim?
[1:31:22] <%cylish> If JoJo taught me anything. Posing first makes you hit harder.
[1:31:23] <%ScreamLord> It'll go SPLAT

[1:31:24] <oniwahoo> "It makes their legs have bullets in them" that's awesome
[1:31:24] <%chambatron> You have to shoot their prolapsed Anus
[1:31:25] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> if you listen Paige is splooshing happily because of a dead woman
[1:31:25] <%cureneckbeard> Pat is safer from being knocked down because his legs are a smaller target.
[1:31:25] <b_ikki> the boring looking one
[1:31:26] <+goldenwerewolf> The bad one
[1:31:29] <%rytyoung> Umbrella corps multiplayer with subs when tho
[1:31:30] <%ssjklyco> It gives you a leg up on the enemy
[1:31:31] <%ospreyworks> Question: wouldn't you smell awful if you spent all day in a wetsuit?
[1:31:33] <sothatsprettybrutal> just embrace the cheating
[1:31:33] <%SWFanatic> Welcome to the SS Bullets EVERYWHERE boat

[1:31:52] <+MrAtheGreat> DLC gun? Don't think there are
[1:31:52] <%connos_procrastination> 8
[1:31:53] <%KeystoneA1> Jill's Samurai Edge DLC gun isn't that much better than the starter

[1:32:11] <%terminallyCapriciousz> pat missed the glowy
[1:32:14] <%Essixian> So is this the game where Jill's ass is the hugest it's ever been?
[1:32:15] <+MrAtheGreat> What, did you buy the DLC gun with play coins?
[1:32:16] <+DatGuyJimbo> 12 is Jessica's gun I think
[1:32:17] <+trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt your coming up on a item box soon

[1:32:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> *asks chat* also: *ignores chat*
[1:32:21] <%CalderGaming> @ospreyworks yes, but anything you wear as a Resident Evil Protagonist would still result in you smelling terrible by the end of the day
[1:32:22] <cochramd1992> flex that booty girl
[1:32:23] <+Omegaconker> item in hallway
[1:32:23] <VoidBeam> Then I pull out my beretta

[1:32:28] <%chhdez> They're just wet socks
[1:32:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> 8 Rounds
[1:32:29] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the 4 rounds gun does the most damage per bullet, the 8 is medium, and the 12 does the least amount per bullet
[1:32:30] <HeavyManaBeast2> 4 is strong, 8 normal 12 weak but fast
[1:32:34] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @PatStaresAt ANGRIEST PAT wouldn't have missed the sparklies
[1:32:35] <eco419> EleGiggle
[1:32:38] <%ospreyworks> @joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo But what about Chris' sweaty balls?

[2:01:40] <%tusk102> @Zombrocom he doesn't have a weapon
[2:01:41] <%CaptainKarite> Fuck these bombos

[2:02:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> DLC Magic
[2:02:42] <Hydrapissed> SLORB
[2:02:43] <DrkJP520> There was a weapon part right outside the door
[2:02:44] <gordieda20> LUL
[2:02:46] <%cdrom321> What gun do you start with?
[2:02:46] <%SWFanatic> I wish my gun had average performance
[2:02:50] <KeiPrime> i think jill starts with her samurai edge
[2:02:53] <%AdamTheJaggi> is sheva even mentioned after RE5?
[2:02:55] <%KeystoneA1> I like this menu's tune so much
[2:02:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[2:02:56] <KeiPrime> chris starts with m9
[2:03:04] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the gun with 4 bullets is the highest damaging gun because it has the least bullets
[2:03:07] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> yo the modding is DOPE
[2:03:07] <+textandnumbers> man, just watched old shitstorms where pat says sailor jupiter sucks for the ponytail. how times change
[2:03:13] <%Bt_Robot> PUT THAT SHOTGUN INTO YOUR PISTOL
[2:03:15] <myriad_truth> I want a Samurai Edge!!!
[2:03:17] <SulfurousAcid> just use the best one
[2:03:18] <KaseKaizer> that fucking silverballer
[2:03:23] <$PleasantLeech> the moding is pretty good
[2:03:24] <%xUmbraNinja> Dump the trash
[2:03:27] <%SirGO0SE> the M92F is the default gun
[2:03:31] <%SolidusRex> Sheva was mentioned in a file in RE6
[2:03:32] <dukenux> "Sailor Jupiter sucks" HAS TO BE one of Pat's worst takes, and that says something
[2:03:33] <%KeystoneA1> Parker's 1911 is shit because of the low ROF
[2:03:35] <KeiPrime> parker and jessicas are the bonus ones
[2:03:37] <dan_g_v> i totally forgot about these upgrades
[2:03:38] <%jemeralddragoon> @textandnumbers he actually said he hates Jupiter because he hates her color scheme of brown and green
[2:03:40] <%connos_procrastination> id like to put my gun in jills box
[2:03:42] <Aydarkzero> makes sense that Jill & Chris would keep the Samurai Edge
[2:03:44] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Jill is Jill, so it makes sense she would have the Jill's Samurai Edge.
[2:03:46] <SulfurousAcid> Government has too low of a firing rate
[2:03:47] <iamnotaparrot> samurai edge, government, and g18 are all DLC
[2:03:49] <%DatGuyJimbo> parkers gun with burst and charge is dope
[2:03:51] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt there's a mod part outside the room
[2:03:53] <+Remery_> Sailor Jupitor was the best tho wtf
[2:03:53] <twistedj3ster> M( is the best
[2:03:54] <KeiPrime> oh ok
[2:03:55] <+professormorrigan> Samurai Edge isn't default
[2:03:59] <KeiPrime> w/e
[2:04:00] <+trekkie11041> M92F is the base gun
[2:04:01] <%SirGO0SE> yeah the M9 is the default
[2:04:03] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> if you are beast, you can mod a magnum that has auto fire, no reload, and used pistol ammo
[2:04:04] <%tusk102> @professormorrigan he doesn't care
[2:04:06] <KeiPrime> that makes more sense
[2:04:11] <trianglehat> now shoot dog
[2:04:14] <+CptCreampuff16> you missed weapon parts
[2:04:15] <%jemeralddragoon> Pat thinks Sailor Mars is the best because she's an uppity bitch
[2:04:15] <+MrAtheGreat> Samurai Edge sounds like a DLC
[2:04:17] <%D3rrtyD4n> now we get the fuck out
[2:04:17] <%Dragovus> @PatStaresAt there was a mod right outside this room
[2:04:20] <iamnotaparrot> they were paid DLC on the wiiu 360 ps3 and free on the ps4 xbine switch release
[2:04:22] <+CptCreampuff16> out the door to the right
[2:04:22] <%tusk102> gross
[2:04:22] <Pwgregory> Wait Canada sells bags of milk?
[2:04:23] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Sailor Venus you plebians
[2:04:24] <evbites> wesker kept the samurai edge
[2:04:28] <Zombrocom> "default"
[2:04:29] <+professormorrigan> @tusk102 and neither do i. worth mentioning regardles ;)
[2:04:29] <%connos_procrastination> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:04:29] <%tank7013> Just on a shelf
[2:04:30] <%jemeralddragoon> Venus sucks
[2:04:31] <SulfurousAcid> go back to samurai eeedddgeee
[2:04:31] <KeiPrime> its not like you dont end up swimming in guns
[2:04:32] <+glgzephyr> scan his dick
[2:04:37] <%rytisone> default for normies
[2:04:37] <+Remery_> Venus was also a bitch
[2:04:38] <Fro5tburn> LUL
[2:04:39] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @jemeralddragoon exactly
[2:04:40] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea
[2:04:40] <KeiPrime> or is that only raid mode i dont recall
[2:04:44] <%tusk102> @professormorrigan psaHoldon
[2:04:44] <dukenux> It's Jupiter, then Mercury, then all the rest
[2:04:45] <myriad_truth> They changed Jill's face and voice only to never use it again...
[2:04:48] <%SWFanatic> thank you for number
[2:04:48] <trianglehat> damage go up
[2:04:49] <cochramd1992> NUMBER GET BIGGER
[2:04:49] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Good shit
[2:04:50] <+textandnumbers> well he did mention mars being superior because her hair was down
[2:04:51] <%D3rrtyD4n> nice
[2:04:55] <%jemeralddragoon> @Sphincter_Spelunker did you just...
[2:05:02] <+jamsbybetty> Do you think Wesker Samurai Edges himself when he's alone?
[2:05:03] <stranger59> BIG numbers for BIG asses
[2:05:06] <Jetsfantasy> Why 10% on the 150 gun and not the 190?
[2:05:13] <a_c_chirns> anyone else keep 5 9mm rounds on their painting?
[2:05:14] <%tank7013> It's fucking EVERYWHERE but you go through it pretty fast
[2:05:17] <bestwaifuritsu> You can just push Parker around and he slides lol
[2:05:19] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> you get ammo pouches to hold more
[2:05:22] <+glgzephyr> casual conversation
[2:05:27] <%connos_procrastination> wesker just has excella do it
[2:05:28] <+Micalica> fucking gross oh my god
[2:05:29] <sothatsprettybrutal> that ass pouch has... ample capacity
[2:05:33] <%j0ustar> it was a 3DS game. You try aiming right with that thing
[2:05:33] <%tusk102> @Jetsfantasy it's not default. it also fires slow as fuck and only holds 4 bullets
[2:05:35] <%코코꾸라> Let us open the zombie fridge
[2:05:38] <+AngelYoumou> Don't you get more % for scanning living enemies?
[2:05:40] <dukenux> So WHAT'S THE DEAAALL with guy in a gas mask?
[2:05:40] <theamazingroberto> are they going to co-op revelayitons 2?
[2:05:44] <+HyperCharge_Sam> I think the amount you pick up is dependent on how much you have
[2:05:48] <%Lion_kun> Lion_kun subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 25 month streak! Hey Pat, Writing to say that this is the first stream I'm watching live after catching up on your VODs. I've been trying to catch up since DS2 way back when. Super happy to finally have caught up in time for Jill's thicc ass wooo
[2:05:49] <+glgzephyr> it's fine the game is throwing ammo at you
[2:05:50] <%kingbaconcrispy> There's a limit to the ammo, but there's lot indeed
[2:05:51] <cochramd1992> luxurious
[2:05:52] <%tusk102> @AngelYoumou dead and living enemies have different scans
[2:05:55] <%connos_procrastination> friendly reminder that wesker fucked
[2:05:58] <daemos123> some of the pouches and custom parts need to be scanned first
[2:05:58] <Jetsfantasy> @tusk102 Ah, that's fair.
[2:05:59] <b_ikki> he has no tv tho
[2:06:01] <dukenux> Does this game have coop?
[2:06:12] <+glgzephyr> @connos_procrastination Turkey baster
[2:06:14] <KeiPrime> i think you can coop raid mode? it s been a while
[2:06:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @connos_procrastination he could have a test tube thing going
[2:06:20] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> does the C-stick even work? I'm convinced it's just a stiff nipple button
[2:06:21] <trianglehat> aww shame
[2:06:26] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> raid more is SOOOO GOOD
[2:06:27] <+glgzephyr> it finally worked
[2:06:28] <%tusk102> @Jetsfantasy it actually fires at nearly half the speed of the default gun
[2:06:30] <Aydarkzero> i always wanted to try out the Raid feature here
[2:06:32] <mak0t0yukii> It was like Co op was an original idea for this game
[2:06:33] <dukenux> Damn, if only there was some Master of Unlocking here.
[2:06:34] <%studleydoorite> Paige excels at raiding things!
[2:06:35] <TyrantSlime> I like the raid modes
[2:06:35] <+AngelYoumou> LAMPREYED
[2:06:36] <%j0ustar> S U C C
[2:06:38] <%SoFarFetched> I mean it wtas on a 3DS so makes sense why no CoOp LUL
[2:06:39] <iamnotaparrot> do you think Excella Gionne is Jake Wesker's mom?
[2:06:40] <trianglehat> boink
[2:06:41] <dukenux> Useless LUL
[2:06:41] <%connos_procrastination> nobody who dresses in a matrix bdsm suit doesnt fuck come on guys
[2:06:43] <%D3rrtyD4n> parker you ignorant slut
[2:06:46] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt when will we get Stone Ocean Wesker kids where they are all super losers
[2:06:47] <KaraRedgrave> played raid mode a shitload in rev 2, i like it a lot more then mercs
[2:06:54] <BlackMage66652> Are these things proto-molded?
[2:06:58] <StarlitStunner> Gross Lampreys
[2:06:59] <KaseKaizer> not much
[2:07:00] <dukenux> DID PARKER JUST AIM AT YOUR HEAD THER E
[2:07:01] <AxelCezar> yeah! scan for points yay!
[2:07:04] <%KeystoneA1> @Aydarkzero Most levels are fun. Others not so much.
[2:07:06] <%코코꾸라> Parker is a headass
[2:07:09] <sothatsprettybrutal> he pointed the gun directly at jill
[2:07:10] <Aydarkzero> @iamnotaparrot wouldn't be surprised by that honestly
[2:07:13] <myriad_truth> They Feel like Proto molded
[2:07:17] <Fenlig> Wait is her health gauge on her left bicep? :D
[2:07:23] <dukenux> wtf Parker, basic gun security?
[2:07:31] <a_c_chirns> these are definitely just molded
[2:07:31] <%jemeralddragoon> @Pendragwn that's RE6
[2:07:39] <Clu_Flynn> @iamnotaparrot Jake was 6 in 98, Excella was around 25 in 2009
[2:07:40] <KeiPrime> its the call of duty health meter
[2:07:41] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt they even dissolve into the floors and walls
[2:07:41] <Aydarkzero> can you give Parker weapons?
[2:07:42] <+glgzephyr> nah they're just knockoff amnesia monsters
[2:07:48] <sothatsprettybrutal> in that the molded are like nothing, i guess
[2:07:51] <+Pendragwn> @jemeralddragoon No, RE6 is Golden Wind. I want Stone Ocean Wesker kids
[2:07:51] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> Pat, over time the same enemies are worth less scan data, ALSO they are worth more when they are alive
[2:07:56] <%KeystoneA1> dig up dumbo
[2:07:58] <$PleasantLeech> there's more variety than the molded tho
[2:08:06] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the corpses and living versions are two different scans
[2:08:08] <sothatsprettybrutal> "proto molded" is any blobbo boring ass enemy
[2:08:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @glgzephyr Why not both?
[2:08:10] <%jemeralddragoon> @Pendragwn ah i guess you're right
[2:08:11] <BlackMage66652> Look at Jill's skin tight ass pants
[2:08:11] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> molded after these. that's why they're called molded
[2:08:13] <b_ikki> yeah this game has distinct designs
[2:08:15] <DickChapyGaming> for how much I love RE7, there's really nothing I can do to defend the molded
[2:08:19] <%depressed_skeleton> Dummy thicc
[2:08:21] <gunzerkingdunce> Rev 2 enemies are the same iirc
[2:08:33] <%Hammerknife> wait revelations isn't a fangame? i thought it was a mod of re4
[2:08:34] <Hellarussian> Steve Burnside would have found it
[2:08:35] <dukenux> what nationality is Parker?
[2:08:37] <iamnotaparrot> Excella was 25??? she looked 40 with plastic easy. I'll have to reread resident evil archives II. I think that has canon ages amd stuff
[2:08:43] <%valriot> Why are these monster stop motion
[2:08:43] <%miguelrod777> shoot the goo my dude
[2:08:44] <GiygasDrillBreak> italian
[2:08:45] <+AngelYoumou> @Hammerknife Nope, it was on the 3DS
[2:08:45] <Clu_Flynn> enemies in Rev 2 are totally different from this
[2:08:46] <+glgzephyr> @doc_ock_rokc I just don't really agree with the molded comparison except for the animations
[2:08:47] <+Pendragwn> @Hammerknife How did you think that???
[2:08:47] <savagedeviljayho> revelations jill Kreygasm
[2:08:48] <cochramd1992> mmmm, tiny turkey
[2:08:52] <+professormorrigan> Molded remind me of Regenerators, but not scary
[2:08:56] <myriad_truth> Excella was supposed to be some super genius
[2:08:57] <GiygasDrillBreak> Parker "Lucky" Luciani
[2:08:58] <%Shadicara> Resident scanevil
[2:08:58] <%tusk102> @dukenux his nationality is "expendable"
[2:09:00] <%rytisone> so much mist in this room
[2:09:00] <b_ikki> you're doing it
[2:09:01] <%D3rrtyD4n> yeah
[2:09:03] <Royalguard22> So, you mean the whole game?
[2:09:06] <islandoasis> BIOSHOCK DID IT
[2:09:07] <%MajorCrasher> the whole game is dull
[2:09:10] <%D3rrtyD4n> its like constant batman vision
[2:09:12] <Clu_Flynn> @iamnotaparrot she didn't even look remotely close to 30... lmao
[2:09:13] <%SirGO0SE> yeah itd be way more rad if you were shooting invisible hunters
[2:09:14] <%jemeralddragoon> i guess it kind of does look like a RE4 mod
[2:09:14] <sothatsprettybrutal> iamnotaparrot remember that 25 is steps from the grave in japan though
[2:09:15] <transporterthesequel> Rev Jill's bodysuit is TOO STRONG
[2:09:16] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> It's dull, but I think it's kinda interesting.
[2:09:18] <%connos_procrastination> excella was in her 30s
[2:09:18] <islandoasis> SO WE NEED IT TOO
[2:09:22] <twistedj3ster> I think it was a DS gimmick
[2:09:22] <stranger59> If I look away and then back I just get lost in Jill's ass
[2:09:22] <+Remery_> that's why the ass is there. to always entertain and tease you. :)
[2:09:23] <%D3rrtyD4n> oof
[2:09:24] <%Shadicara> Anything to avoid 6 Kappa
[2:09:26] <oniwahoo> @myriad_truth Not genius enough to know injecting yourself with a virus is a bad idea
[2:09:29] <dukenux> It's less dull than 0 or CVX TBH

[2:09:50] <%SirGO0SE> i wish jill would parker ass on my face
[2:09:55] <Louie_Salmon> Well the moira thing is just the RE4 treasures, but there's more and it's harder, but only one character is worried about it.
[2:09:58] <Clu_Flynn> @myriad_truth Wesker was 48 in 2009

[2:10:23] <$Literal___Nobody> Claws are for latching on Pat

[2:10:34] <dukenux> Ah yes bite claws, also know as "teeth" to biteclawdontistst
[2:10:34] <%sleepy_coffee> Moira was a weird addition like why have a child who can point
[2:10:34] <+BubbaRands> Teeth shall now be known as "Bite Claws"
[2:10:40] <stranger59> I'm stealing Bite Claws
[2:10:41] <bleugh> so was there a reason the guy gassed you and then just left you in a room

[2:10:47] <BoneofMalkav> "Why would you... yeah... you know?" Pat 2020
[2:10:48] <oniwahoo> Those guys are maniacs, why won't they bite you?
[2:10:48] <%InugamiTheHound> can you play as parker or other characters besides chris and jill?
[2:10:52] <%tusk102> @sleepy_coffee moira was barrys daughter
[2:10:55] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> in raid mode
[2:10:55] <MicrotonalMatt> Bite claws for toothing your prey
[2:10:56] <%MakotoPB> teeth not for chewing. It's to keep prey from escaping
[2:11:00] <%TheDullaMAN> I was feeding my cat, did Pat just say "bite claws"?
[2:11:00] <iamnotaparrot> you play as Parker in flashbacks
[2:11:02] <%kingbaconcrispy> They clamp on you to suck better, like my dick.
[2:11:04] <%tusk102> @sleepy_coffee and not the point child
[2:11:05] <b_ikki> theres another playable character
[2:11:09] <BlackMage66652> @TheDullaMAN Yes
[2:11:11] <%cureneckbeard> How dry do you want it
[2:11:11] <jeffishype> those melee attacks are actually bad
[2:11:11] <dukenux> this feels like... haunted house + shooting gallery
[2:11:14] <%jemeralddragoon> @TheDullaMAN he did indeed
[2:11:16] <Lewdyhat> Like a hook maybe?
[2:11:19] <%umbypokochan> i feel like this game would be way better if it was way darker
[2:11:19] <%Shadicara> So in this game you shoot their hands?
[2:11:20] <jeffishype> this entire game looks and feels like watered down re5
[2:11:22] <stranger59> There are a few more playable characters, actually
[2:11:23] <islandoasis> shit, my finger teeth are too long
[2:11:24] <%connos_procrastination> i hope we see gun moira in future games
[2:11:27] <%tusk102> @jeffishype it is
[2:11:28] <Clu_Flynn> @inugamithehound In campaign not really, except yes but nobody cares about that one character
[2:11:28] <Lewdyhat> keep em there for the suck
[2:11:31] <dukenux> which im sure IS a theme park attraction somewhere(and if not, it should be)
[2:11:31] <$PleasantLeech> you play as parker in a flashback
[2:11:32] <tactician0> forwhen they want to add a little teeth y'know
[2:11:39] <Royalguard22> Smellmo sleeping
[2:11:39] <twistedj3ster> Just have Jill's ass mold into the circle
[2:11:41] <sothatsprettybrutal> get a crest
[2:11:42] <BlackMage66652> @PatStaresAt Did you brush your bite claws this morning?
[2:11:44] <%Bt_Robot> THE MONSTERS ARE AFTER YOUR MADMAN'S KNOWLEDGE
[2:11:50] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> 3pcs
[2:11:56] <b_ikki> big hands
[2:11:58] <%Shadicara> Big boi
[2:12:00] <Hellarussian> who is Pat playing as?
[2:12:01] <islandoasis> now THOSE are bite claws
[2:12:02] <KeiPrime> crab battle
[2:12:02] <%코코꾸라> CRAB
[2:12:03] <dukenux> oh shit, claw teeth boy
[2:12:03] <$frankthetank285> yeah they did a better job than pokemon did

[2:12:06] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> grenade?
[2:12:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> head
[2:12:09] <%ComboDogeX> oh my
[2:12:10] <daemos123> shoot butt
[2:12:10] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> ok google, remind me to buy a finger teeth filer
[2:12:10] <Clu_Flynn> @hellarussian ugliest Jill
[2:12:11] <%Bt_Robot> HED?
[2:12:12] <%SirGO0SE> the way they move is so unsettling
[2:12:13] <dukenux> ass
[2:12:13] <stranger59> Crotch
[2:12:14] <MrFoodski> those moves
[2:12:17] <Jetsfantasy> Those are just barely big enough to grab Jill's ass with
[2:12:18] <primarch_lupercal> wow the molded really were inspired by these guys
[2:12:19] <BlackMage66652> AIM FOR THE BITE CLAWS
[2:12:22] <dukenux> shoot. mouf
[2:12:23] <%tank7013> I thought it was pretty cool how in Rev 2 raid mode even THESE guys showed up
[2:12:23] <%connos_procrastination> hes got parkinsons
[2:12:24] <%Mr_Strut> Giant enemy crab
[2:12:26] <+trekkie11041> CLAWS PAT
[2:12:27] <myriad_truth> So Wesker is older than Barry???
[2:12:30] <%Shadicara> LUL
[2:12:34] <dukenux> and yeah, actual bite claws
[2:12:35] <+glgzephyr> really handy to have the enemies just completely ignore your ai partner
[2:12:37] <%rytisone> Crab people
[2:12:40] <%Laecerelius> Maybe Pat should do the Resident Evil Spin
[2:12:40] <%Jekado> OTG!
[2:12:44] <cochramd1992> HEADSHOT
[2:12:44] <islandoasis> just walks pass your buddy
[2:12:44] <%D3rrtyD4n> thats a shitty mechanic LUL
[2:12:45] <%bread_assassin> The enemy designs in this game look awful, imo.
[2:12:46] <Clu_Flynn> @myriad_truth same age, one must be a few months older than the other
[2:12:47] <%Shadicara> Get crabbed
[2:12:48] <BlackMage66652> HENTAI IMMINENT
[2:12:48] <silverira> !uptime
[2:12:48] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 12m.
[2:12:49] <stabbityrabbit> He got arm teeth.
[2:12:53] <oniwahoo> How lenient does the dodge seem to be?
[2:12:53] <+AngelYoumou> You have grenades for the next one
[2:12:58] <myriad_truth> Oh okay
[2:13:00] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt it's literally the molded. same enemy but with big spike arms is the same thing the molded do in re7
[2:13:02] <%MajorCrasher> this game is awful
[2:13:05] <Fenlig> Those enemies are animated so poorly, their limbs look weightless!
[2:13:09] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Knees and mouth are red, so shoot there I guess
[2:13:10] <%Ran196> Why do Jill and Chris keep going into these areas with regular guns? They should know by now to carry bigger guns with BOW killing ammos
[2:13:11] <%connos_procrastination> claw man bodied you
[2:13:15] <myriad_truth> Yep, Proto molded
[2:13:17] <Clu_Flynn> @majorcrasher yet better than 6 and Rev 2
[2:13:18] <oniwahoo> Hmm ok
[2:13:25] <$elaineybo> Cheer250 Hey Pat! Been watching your shit for a good couple years at this point, figured I’d finally contribute something more than my eyeballs. Out of all the resident evil dudes, who do you think best embodies the word “himbo”?
[2:13:28] <trianglehat> melty bois
[2:13:33] <oniwahoo> Goo monsters
[2:13:37] <%MajorCrasher> @clu_flynn honestly I'd say rev 2 is better
[2:13:40] <dukenux> take a picture of Parker
[2:13:43] <%realm_forge> If you’re the nocturnal partner shit’ll just walk by you apparently
[2:13:44] <KaseKaizer> Ricardo
[2:13:46] <dukenux> for the happy memories :)
[2:13:50] <Clu_Flynn> @ran196 Jill upgraded to assault rifles and Jill pretty much retired LUL
[2:13:51] <BlackMage66652> When did this game come out? Might have actually been inspired by Molded designs
[2:13:54] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Ran196 they know they will find bigger guns once they see the stiarcase layout of where ever they end up
[2:13:56] <%Shadicara> Went from zombos to ugly aliens
[2:13:57] <%InugamiTheHound> I think pat missed something in the room before tis one(it was on the wall)
[2:13:58] <b_ikki> no lol
[2:13:58] <%kingbaconcrispy> @Ran196 Gotta respectthat early game
[2:13:58] <dukenux> ew, his succ organ hanging out
[2:14:00] <Lewdyhat> So that one is just nothing but teeth and no suck
[2:14:04] <Melchior_the_Wise> Is this worse than Silent Hill Homecoming?
[2:14:04] <b_ikki> this came out in like 2012
[2:14:04] <%asgard147> monkaS
[2:14:04] <%heartlesshealer> am I supposed to be bored of ship music?
[2:14:05] <%realm_forge> *npc partner
[2:14:06] <Clu_Flynn> @majorcrasher in terms of story and some characters yes, much better
[2:14:06] <%jemeralddragoon> @Ran196 because no matter what organization you work for, there is always a budget, and more powerful ordinance needs to be requisitioned, so its easy to go in with minimum firepower
[2:14:09] <twistedj3ster> HE'S A GHOST
[2:14:11] <myriad_truth> I wish Jill kicked like that in RE3...
[2:14:11] <b_ikki> maybe earlier
[2:14:14] <stranger59> You imagined him
[2:14:18] <%Punchasaur> These CW beep boop sound effects
[2:14:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> try looking up?
[2:14:23] <BoneofMalkav> But You're pat :)
[2:14:30] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you can scan them while they're alive and the corpse for more points pat
[2:14:31] <cochramd1992> shotgun?
[2:14:31] <amused_platypus> pat have you beaten the new eden stuff
[2:14:31] <%realm_forge> The fat blocks the scanner
[2:14:34] <SLVRBAKSLPZ> gotta love open-source computer sounds
[2:14:34] <%xUmbraNinja> I’m pat
[2:14:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> sometimes its on the floor above or below you
[2:14:44] <%ForlornCarton> The problem with the scanner is that it can detect thing near you in other rooms.
[2:14:46] <%Punchasaur> ENHANCE
[2:14:47] <silverira> @PatStaresAt isn't better to scan them when they are alive?
[2:14:47] <ricky12k> Alright so seems things going well pat.
[2:15:01] <KeiPrime> he was scanning a few alive ones
[2:15:05] <IndoorSitup> Hey, anyone know if Pat's gonna play Revelations 2 and 6 with Paige in co op?
[2:15:12] <kite1haseo> Did she just break chains with a knife?
[2:15:15] <+rascalrebel> people are really obsessed with scanning everything
[2:15:16] <+glgzephyr> re6 is solo
[2:15:16] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> rev2 coop, 6 single
[2:15:17] <transporterthesequel> Look at that chunko dude
[2:15:21] <myriad_truth> He said he was but no RE6 coop
[2:15:22] <%connos_procrastination> if you think about it all of jills designs are horny wuth the exception of REmake 3s wich is just shit
[2:15:25] <%Typhaeon> The Fat Good?
[2:15:25] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt push him out of the elevator
[2:15:29] <%heartlesshealer> Pat
[2:15:31] <%tusk102> @silverira its better to scan both. you can do both cuz you can can them after they die too
[2:15:32] <b_ikki> ...
[2:15:34] <%jemeralddragoon> @IndoorSitup Pat absolutely REFUSES to do RE6 coop
[2:15:36] <Darren716> Pat its another level
[2:15:39] <%MajorCrasher> I legitimately got lost so many fucking times on this boat. the map is incomprehensible and the corridors are like a maze
[2:15:40] <%heartlesshealer> It erases the current floor from the elevator menu
[2:15:41] <%cdrom321> Why does the elevator have a button for the floor that I'm already on?
[2:15:43] <+glgzephyr> master of unlocking
[2:15:45] <%tusk102> @silverira aka scan while alive then scan the corpse also
[2:15:47] <b_ikki> it doesnt
[2:15:48] <%realm_forge> I’d hit her lower cabins BOOM
[2:15:50] <%heartlesshealer> no pat stop
[2:15:51] <BlackMage66652> Hey, they were working on RE7 during the time this came out. The enemies might have ACTUALLY been using a proposed Molded design
[2:15:53] <Hellarussian> gosh bless
[2:15:53] <derekwst3> elevator loards, a really good game idea
[2:15:54] <IndoorSitup> @jemeralddragoon lol why
[2:15:55] <%nofestu2> good job me. thanks me
[2:15:56] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> plump good > fat evil
[2:16:02] <%xUmbraNinja> @IndoorSitup RE6 is solo. Rev2 is with beige
[2:16:04] <myriad_truth> So is this before or after Russia?
[2:16:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> pee feet
[2:16:10] <$elaineybo> this game is too clean
[2:16:11] <%cureneckbeard> beep beep
[2:16:12] <%asgard147> psaWink limesAw
[2:16:15] <b_ikki> someone already videogamed this lock
[2:16:16] <%tiaramaki> That explains some aesthetic aspects that looked suspiciously like the Baker house
[2:16:19] <%jemeralddragoon> @IndoorSitup because the AI is more manageable than a person and the coop partner cannot die
[2:16:21] <Clu_Flynn> so Paige is coming back for Rev 2? klinkWah
[2:16:22] <%Punchasaur> I’m excited for 6 simply because I haven’t seen hardly any of it for obvious reasons
[2:16:23] <+The_Proud_Canadian> oh yay im not too late to stare at Jill's sweet ass
[2:16:24] <%tusk102> @elaineybo just wait till later
[2:16:28] <IndoorSitup> @xumbraninja Ah yes, Beige
[2:16:31] <%jemeralddragoon> at least i think on the dying thing
[2:16:34] <%Dragon_Batman> Oooh yea, Genesis is in Teppen, totally forgot
[2:16:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> pretty much
[2:16:43] <+HyperCharge_Sam> sounds about right
[2:16:45] <daemos123> accurate
[2:16:45] <Aydarkzero> why did they build it that way?
[2:16:46] <%connos_procrastination> more or less
[2:16:46] <twistedj3ster> They're right
[2:16:46] <+rascalrebel> i agree with that sentiment
[2:16:46] <Coystick> Yeah because butt
[2:16:47] <%heartlesshealer> sounds right
[2:16:49] <b_ikki> dunno about trash but pretty eh yeah
[2:16:51] <%tank7013> I wouldn't go THAT far, but yea
[2:16:51] <wrydiculous> yes
[2:16:51] <oniwahoo> Is it because of the booty?
[2:16:52] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> At least that is easy to remember
[2:16:53] <DatAsuna> I like the one Chris level on the ship
[2:16:53] <%Sir_stride> huh
[2:16:56] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> AND RE7
[2:16:56] <%InugamiTheHound> you missed the shotgun
[2:16:57] <%XeroSigmaPrime> HOLY SHIT
[2:16:57] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> crazy
[2:16:58] <Hellarussian> sure is
[2:17:00] <%TheMattman1313> ehhh it's pretty different
[2:17:00] <CrowbarFacelift> oh wow
[2:17:01] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Holy shit
[2:17:01] <%tiaramaki> GEEZ LUL
[2:17:03] <Clu_Flynn> no the game is good as as Chris but you barely play as him anyhow
[2:17:03] <%kingbaconcrispy> Pretty acurate
[2:17:05] <%XeroSigmaPrime> ITS EXACTLY FROM RE7 AND RE5
[2:17:06] <YakumoYomi> I'm an ass man, so this game is relevant to my interests.
[2:17:06] <gordieda20> LUL
[2:17:07] <BlackMage66652> @tiaramaki They had a prelim gameplay demo for RE7 a year after the original release of this. So they might have been kicking designs around.
[2:17:07] <sothatsprettybrutal> it's pretty similar
[2:17:09] <wrydiculous> oh shit it is
[2:17:11] <%Valdorick> To be fair, boats are standarized.
[2:17:11] <IndoorSitup> N O S T A L G I A
[2:17:11] <myriad_truth> I like Chris cockblocking Jessica
[2:17:12] <MrFoodski> holy shit you're right atpCap
[2:17:13] <%kingbaconcrispy> Wait until you get the comic relief characters
[2:17:15] <%Dragon_Batman> It is really similar ya
[2:17:15] <dadeaner> its like shipping bridges are similar
[2:17:16] <%jemeralddragoon> ASSets
[2:17:16] <sothatsprettybrutal> this is just how ships look
[2:17:19] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Punchasaur you're not gonna think that when it's done. only seen it twice because I forgot the 1st time. it's enough
[2:17:20] <$Literal___Nobody> Standard boat design I guess
[2:17:21] <LixFury> because its a boat LUL
[2:17:21] <etnoika> I mean, to be fair,apparently ship bridges usually look very similar
[2:17:21] <+glgzephyr> ships have bridges man
[2:17:21] <derekwst3> yep this is re7 bridge

[2:49:25] <%SvenHolgersson> What other animes have you two been watching?
[2:49:27] <agadejobi> But my body doesn't like the gluten anymore, so I can't have wheat anymore
[2:49:30] <%JJCheeker> Customer farts

[2:49:38] <Psych_man13_13> Still trying to push pathouse
[2:49:43] <%heartlesshealer> goopy enemies
[2:49:45] <+Remery_> chat is fine, it's either horny or arguing over waifus
[2:49:48] <stranger59> This lovely boat mansion
[2:49:48] <trianglehat> this game is kinda bland
[2:49:48] <daemos123> hey pat whose your favorite RE villain?
[2:49:49] <%GraceTBM> they look like ass and they're not responsive
[2:49:50] <natebud> Wasn't Trevor already dead when this boat was made?
[2:49:53] <thelonechris> They're like weird fish zombies
[2:49:54] <twistedj3ster> OH yeah, Pat you should visit the Solarium
[2:49:55] <%DracaenaLeaf> they remind my of silent hill monsters
[2:49:56] <%InugamiTheHound> did pat skipped the shotgun?
[2:49:58] <%GalacticaPhanto> I know my eyesight is shit so I read that as BOW Decay
[2:49:58] <dukenux> Kappa
[2:50:00] <42nfl19> Can't you scan them live for weekpoint?
[2:50:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You would B)
[2:50:02] <myriad_truth> I'm glad I never played this game...
[2:50:03] <%D3rrtyD4n> yeah
[2:50:04] <Darren716> Did pat get lost?
[2:50:06] <+loukemia83> Dead Space did limb damage better
[2:50:06] <KeiPrime> you just got the helm key
[2:50:07] <dadeaner> helm door?
[2:50:09] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> go back
[2:50:09] <%segonian> The small hat instrumentality project went horribly wrong on that island City.
[2:50:11] <%Typhaeon> There are definitely similarities between the Molded
[2:50:11] <%D3rrtyD4n> they dont look great
[2:50:12] <daemos123> go back
[2:50:13] <%kingbaconcrispy> psaBougie
[2:50:14] <C24U> They are really unique looking though
[2:50:15] <dukenux> They're poor mans necromorphs
[2:50:17] <daemos123> you need the shotgun medal
[2:50:18] <b_ikki> they are pretty generic
[2:50:18] <gade177> Yeah they're too ordinary.
[2:50:19] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> go back!
[2:50:21] <%sleepy_coffee> Just shoot em in their head faces to do more damage
[2:50:22] <TwistedVerse> crazy talk
[2:50:23] <%InugamiTheHound> jerk and twerk dat ass
[2:50:24] <%MajorCrasher> Pat is lost
[2:50:25] <myriad_truth> Zombies represent people
[2:50:25] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Dead Space, more like Dead Studio
[2:50:26] <+professormorrigan> molded are more generic
[2:50:30] <%DakotaMacDoodle> DakotaMacDoodle subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! Why is conan o'brien in resident evil also 4 weeks till Eternal so close,
[2:50:31] <natebud> I don't like that they're unaffected by the shotgun
[2:50:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> It is wierd how zombies are A-Tier in this series
[2:50:37] <Mexrage> this is making me want to replay re 2 remake, then i am reminded i have completed it like 14 times in a month (getting S rank to unlock infinite smg)...and now i want RE3 remake even more
[2:50:40] <oniwahoo> Plus zombies are effectively a staple of the series
[2:50:46] <%mankeytennis> Moulded got really boring
[2:50:48] <Man_in_the_Red> @sphincter_spelunker dont remind us how close Bioware is to getting shut down
[2:50:58] <evbites> jack was the best as centipede man
[2:50:59] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you can scan their corpses even if you scanned them while alive
[2:51:00] <%SvenHolgersson> You think Jill rips mad farts in that wetsuit? I hope so
[2:51:01] <Sjotyme_> carciBee carciBee carciBee
[2:51:06] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Does scanning enemies give you weaknesses like in REV2?
[2:51:10] <gade177> Did you know that The Walking Dead is still on? Yeah me neither.
[2:51:11] <daemos123> What's the deal with RE villains and always having loyal butlers?
[2:51:12] <TwistedVerse> zombies are only as original as the clothes they wore when alive
[2:51:13] <C24U> Weird how the best RE game is one with no zombies
[2:51:14] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Man_in_the_Red nah, it's fine. then the talented people can go to obsidian
[2:51:19] <%SirGO0SE> @SvenHolgersson brap gang
[2:51:21] <KeiPrime> scanning enough gives you healing items
[2:51:21] <%JJCheeker> Is PAIGE excited for the new McDonald's scented candles??? @PatStaresAt

[2:56:25] <%rytisone> don't schcrew up again
[2:56:27] <%Shadowpint> Barry is legit my fave RE character

[2:56:45] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 56m.
[2:56:47] <%Shadowpint> A huge reason I love Rev 2 so much is cuz he's playable
[2:56:47] <TheOrganTrail> Ty im blind

[2:56:53] <anAngryHamster> gotta get some sleep for work tomorrow, good night y'all

[2:56:55] <%D3rrtyD4n> im a fan of the classic tyrant
[2:56:55] <natebud> This game's tryant might be in the running
[2:56:56] <%xUmbraNinja> BILLY
[2:56:57] <Psych_man13_13> So how confused would people be if blonde Jill was in RE8 after seeing brunette Jill in REmake 3?
[2:56:58] <%realm_forge> Barry is the Master Roshi of the resident evil universe
[2:56:58] <%SirGO0SE> billy pls
[2:56:58] <OToole42> barry's my favorite RE character
[2:57:04] <hntronium> Pat wants to take the long tunnel home
[2:57:04] <+Zereaux> how come hunk isnt a main character in RE games like isnt he like the big boss of that universe?
[2:57:06] <daemos123> I love that Barry makes dad jokes in Rev 2
[2:57:10] <%heartlesshealer> billy would be great too
[2:57:12] <%InugamiTheHound> @PatStaresAt do you think capcom should make resident evil outbreak file 3?
[2:57:18] <KeiPrime> Theres a game called OPERATION RACOOON CITY you can play
[2:57:18] <%D3rrtyD4n> billeh
[2:57:21] <%tusk102> @Zereaux cuz he's a side character
[2:57:21] <%xUmbraNinja> Need more Billy
[2:57:23] <%NekoUrabe> apatHoldon
[2:57:24] <%jemeralddragoon> @PatStaresAt are you ready for the big retcon about Billy being Nemesis in 3make?
[2:57:26] <C24U> Billy + Sheva team
[2:57:27] <+Remery_> @king_wolf_rigger LuvBlush
[2:57:32] <natebud> you're gonna like this part
[2:57:33] <+Zereaux> so was barry
[2:57:36] <neVan0> LUL
[2:57:38] <%Laecerelius> Filled to burst
[2:57:39] <%Dragon_Batman> Ethan was pretty neat
[2:57:39] <daemos123> I want a Leon and Chris teamup game
[2:57:39] <KeiPrime> i mean i wouldnt
[2:57:40] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> Is this game still alright on the 3Ds or better off on Console/PC?
[2:57:40] <cochramd1992> @jemeralddragoon the what now?
[2:57:40] <%heartlesshealer> so relatable to the audience
[2:57:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Ethan was more like a bland FPS man to me. Basically someone for the player to step into his shoes.
[2:57:42] <gade177> Yeah Ethan was fine.
[2:57:42] <42nfl19> no one likes to get stabbed?
[2:57:43] <%RowenCleric> I like being stabbed :)
[2:57:44] <+UnpronounceableName> yes
[2:57:45] <twistedj3ster> NO
[2:57:45] <%SvenHolgersson> Not like a real man who just hurls boulders at his enemies
[2:57:48] <@commanderclaw> The most relatable motivation
[2:57:48] <black_pariah> @PatStaresAt there's a beta going on for a character action battle royale
[2:57:49] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt he also would kill the bakers and be like "FUCKING STAY DEAD FUCKS SAKE"
[2:57:49] <+Zereaux> no
[2:57:49] <evbites> hopefully more training and becomes less generic
[2:57:49] <RevolverBobkat> not on that
[2:57:49] <%Laecerelius> Ehhh
[2:57:50] <KeiPrime> Console/PC way better
[2:57:50] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Put burst on the shotgun
[2:57:51] <$RetroCop87> I think we need at least a one-game gap before Ethan 2.0
[2:57:52] <DeliciousPears> Maybe
[2:57:52] <TwistedVerse> MAYBE
[2:57:53] <%Punchasaur> Bimmy tho
[2:57:53] <+SlumberMan> Ethan also fucks,
[2:57:54] <%MajorCrasher> Ethan was way too ok with fighting weird monsters
[2:57:54] <%lionandfox21> @Zereaux He isn't, the big bad was always Wesker, HUNK is just some cool op guy who can't die
[2:57:55] <%AmazingBlanket> no
[2:57:55] <natebud> Worth it
[2:57:58] <%ospreyworks> eh, Ethan was plainer than wonder bread
[2:57:58] <KitsuneManami> @PatStaresAt Does Jill want Chris?
[2:58:02] <%Faustgesicht> What if the next protagonist liked being stabbed?
[2:58:04] <%kknutson4> Sure
[2:58:04] <%realm_forge> He got all kinds of fucked up
[2:58:06] <+AngelYoumou> @PatStaresAt Damage on Shotgun?
[2:58:08] <cochramd1992> @daemos123 "Fine Chris, I'll knock up your sister, now let's focus on killing these zombies"
[2:58:10] <+WeepProphet> Get Claire and Leon back together
[2:58:11] <%Laecerelius> Do you care about potentially wasting ammo in exchange for higher DPS?
[2:58:16] <daemos123> wish the re6 confrontation between Leon and Chris was a boss fight
[2:58:18] <%tusk102> @KitsuneManami no because sex is not allowed in this universe
[2:58:20] <+ZephynM> I wanted to like this game so much, but the first boss fight was a hard no for me.
[2:58:22] <natebud> One guy says no
[2:58:26] <tactician0> if joe is it'll be fine
[2:58:34] <daemos123> first boss is a bit tough
[2:58:36] <+Remery_> not even a dry hump in this universe
[2:58:36] <%Shadowpint> Ethan was the weakest RE protag in the mainline games IMO
[2:58:37] <cochramd1992> behind portrait?
[2:58:39] <%tusk102> @daemos123 Chris challenged Leon to fuck his sister! Leon ran away!
[2:58:41] <%D3rrtyD4n> wtf
[2:58:41] <trianglehat> wait a minute that card
[2:58:42] <C24U> Doesn't this game have the most absurd monster names ever?
[2:58:46] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ranged bois now
[2:58:53] <%D3rrtyD4n> shits poppin off out here
[2:58:59] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> this game is dumb
[2:58:59] <%Laecerelius> This is some tyranid shit right here
[2:59:00] <%Jekado> BONE SAW?
[2:59:01] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Da fuck is this guy?
[2:59:05] <gade177> Man that looks like shit.
[2:59:06] <KeiPrime> this game has like Dante's Inferno names for all the monsters
[2:59:07] <%chambatron> I can do that shit with my boogers
[2:59:07] <MicrotonalMatt> In this world sex is a threat worse than death
[2:59:11] <TwistedVerse> call him CROSSBONE
[2:59:12] <+ShadowRiida> !uptime
[2:59:13] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 59m.
[2:59:13] <%Estuko> These enemy designs are just not fun FeelsBadMan
[2:59:13] <%MajorCrasher> these things are so fucking stupid, what do they even shoot at you?
[2:59:14] <KeiPrime> so like FarFarello and shit like that
[2:59:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I'd just shoot them in the head. The ranged guys are weak.
[2:59:17] <+CryptusMaximus> RE Universe so starved for character development that "Doesn't like getting stabbed" is admirable.
[2:59:18] <natebud> These guys are a headshot
[2:59:19] <%SvenHolgersson> I hate how like 50% of RE enemies are just goo things
[2:59:20] <daemos123> these look sort of like silent hill monsters
[2:59:26] <%Jekado> is this a anti paige molded?
[2:59:30] <%Jekado> it shoots bones at you
[2:59:31] <graemecrackers1> her butt looks great in that suit
[2:59:35] <daemos123> Pat will you ever play Silent Hill 4?
[2:59:46] <%xUmbraNinja> Beige asleep?
[2:59:50] <DatAsuna> coward
[2:59:53] <b_ikki> gambling deanGasm
[2:59:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> uh huh
[2:59:54] <%ssjklyco> What if we gave you money
[2:59:54] <gollygee> Can we talk about how RE is a universe where people turning into giant freak monsters is literally a fact of daily life? BOW outbreaks just happen everywhere LUL
[3:00:04] <twistedj3ster> These were SO LONG on the 3DS
[3:00:04] <+AngelYoumou> It's not worth it at all, SH4 is bullshit hard
[3:00:07] <C24U> Can beat Silent Hill 4 in like 3 hours
[3:00:09] <+waltzqueen> God, I want tos ee you tackle that. It's so good and so bad at the same time
[3:00:10] <evbites> i hope re 8 is a hybrid science experiment i.e werewolf, snake lady,vampire,black lagoon, and bugs
[3:00:10] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That's actually a good tho
[3:00:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Get ready for the REAL "What a Boat Mansion!" upcoming.
[3:00:14] <KitsuneManami> @PatStaresAt Wil you play ALL Silent Hill games if a Sillent Hill 3 Remake came out?
[3:00:18] <%Laecerelius> YEAH!
[3:00:22] <natebud> Pat was lied to about how hard SH4 was.
[3:00:26] <+waltzqueen> @C24U you're a mad lad. it's been four years and i just game up
[3:00:27] <%D3rrtyD4n> lol
[3:00:32] <KeiPrime> who wants to play downpour or homecoming again
[3:00:34] <%SvenHolgersson> FAKE FAN
[3:00:37] <red_blaster> Play Book of Memories
[3:00:43] <enby_shout> Pat do you like poutine, I used to live in northern maine and now i can't get poutine
[3:00:44] <%Estuko> @evbites snake lady please. god fuck
[3:00:46] <dukenux> Play The Room you coward
[3:00:47] <black_pariah> @PatStaresAt there's a beta going on for a character action battle royale Hunters Arena
[3:00:47] <%Shadowpint> Also who would trust Konami to remake SH well
[3:00:49] <%rytisone> Silent Hill 3 Remake only on a pachinko
[3:00:49] <%srkAres> what do you mean, dont you enjoy HOMECOMING
[3:00:49] <assman1234> Then just play the good ones
[3:00:49] <daemos123> I find the peak of Silent HIll is better than Resident Evil, but overall its worse than resident evil
[3:00:51] <natebud> Did you know Henry's charge attacks give him complete invincibility?
[3:00:51] <babo____> thats the same with RE tho lol
[3:00:52] <SoySocks> that pendulum is MASSIVE
[3:00:52] <KitsuneManami> @PatStaresAt what are the 3?
[3:00:53] <tactician0> I remember beating 4 and thought it was fine
[3:00:54] <%SolidusRex> 4 is fine
[3:00:55] <mattynezz> Shattered Memories is not "pretty bad", fuck you
[3:00:58] <%lionandfox21> I miss when Konami didn't suck
[3:00:58] <+textandnumbers> i dunno 4 is alright
[3:00:58] <%SoFarFetched> the true joke is there ACTUALLY being a remake LUL for Silent Hill
[3:00:59] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> The Downcomming was good tho
[3:01:01] <$RenegadeHatter> So why did you put up with the Garbage that is Homecoming?
[3:01:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it's so faaancy
[3:01:06] <dukenux> Also, you were saying the same about RE
[3:01:08] <Psych_man13_13> I don’t think you could survive playing homecoming again
[3:01:11] <%AnIcedCoffee> 4 and shattered memories are fine
[3:01:11] <%SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:01:11] <C24U> @waltzqueen World record run is like 48 minutes
[3:01:13] <ShinTeach> zero is good too
[3:01:14] <daemos123> Silent HIlls on Pachinko exclusive
[3:01:14] <DickChapyGaming> he's not wrong
[3:01:14] <TheOrganTrail> My favorite angry canuck
[3:01:14] <dullvivid> pretty much
[3:01:15] <Belutima> @PatStaresAt then maybe just play those 3 good ones should there be a second woopsISee no need to do the same like re
[3:01:17] <%D3rrtyD4n> ....4... atpRtsd
[3:01:18] <%xUmbraNinja> @PatStaresAt Your fav silent hill?
[3:01:19] <dan_g_v> even the light gun silent hill?
[3:01:19] <+AngelYoumou> 4 is not fine
[3:01:19] <Aracon_> true
[3:01:20] <%Hammerknife> would you play a silent hill gacha card game
[3:01:20] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> BUT DOWNCOMING THO
[3:01:22] <%bread_assassin> 4's bad, but at least it's better than what came after.
[3:01:23] <Ranger747> 4 rulz
[3:01:23] <%RowenCleric> this some castlevania music
[3:01:24] <KitsuneManami> @PatStaresAt Well then just replay 1 2 and then do 3 RE :P
[3:01:25] <enby_shout> 4 is good
[3:01:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yup
[3:01:25] <C24U> I hate how Silent Hill 3 treated Harry
[3:01:25] <KeiPrime> 4 has some moments in it but its so fuckin weird
[3:01:26] <Aracon_> 4 is hyper garbage
[3:01:26] <evbites> @Estuko they know what people like plague want
[3:01:26] <%MajorCrasher> Downcoming LUL
[3:01:27] <%Mr_Strut> Pat confirms RE4 is terrible
[3:01:27] <%DracaenaLeaf> 4 is fine but gets annoying with ghosts
[3:01:27] <dukenux> 4 is honestly good, for a one playthrough
[3:01:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it is
[3:01:31] <+Press_X_ToJASON> THATS WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT RESI
[3:01:31] <Fep3> downpour is my favorite
[3:01:33] <KeiPrime> not just story but how it plays too
[3:01:34] <natebud> 4 is fine, not that hard either
[3:01:36] <%trustycoyote> Or Castle Greyskull
[3:01:36] <%SolidusRex> Silent Hill 0 is NOT good
[3:01:37] <+trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt dont forget to do the water purifier right now
[3:01:37] <+Zereaux> did you ever finish off the game guy cihi talked about on the friendcast all those years ago?
[3:01:38] <gollygee> 2 > 3 > 1 > 4 > Downpour > Homecoming > others
[3:01:42] <%TheMattman1313> "Oh look, that cliff I'm gonna fall off of later!"
[3:01:42] <%InugamiTheHound> "one more soul to the call" from homecoming is pretty good though
[3:01:43] <TwistedVerse> this music is so dramatic LUL
[3:01:43] <dukenux> No, i think that's Anor Londo
[3:01:44] <daemos123> Is Wesker or Alfred a better villain?
[3:01:46] <%SvenHolgersson> I don't like RE or Silent Hill games so I can't be mad by any of these opinions no matter how wrong they might be
[3:01:46] <%tusk102> @Mr_Strut hes talking about silent hill tho
[3:01:54] <bigdumbidiotguy> did he fight Scagded already?
[3:01:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mmmhm
[3:02:01] <+AngelYoumou> Look at this loading screen!
[3:02:01] <MicrotonalMatt> I love my opera houses the way I like my cruise ships: full of Jill’s clapping cheeks and puddle monsters

[3:02:19] <dukenux> 2>3=1>4>Downcoming
[3:02:20] <+Zereaux> man parasite eve was so fucking good
[3:02:22] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Alfred is a way better villain. He's actually fun and interesting.
[3:02:23] <mattynezz> 2 > 1 > 3 >>> SM > 4 >>> Origins >>> Rotten Trash >>> The Rest
[3:02:23] <enby_shout> eat the slime
[3:02:23] <%NekoUrabe> Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 I just saw a billboard for WestWorld is that a good or a bad

[3:02:57] <+Press_X_ToJASON> @CalderGaming oh, i know, I just think it was really funny how hard he needed to walk that one back. I know everything after 4 was bad minus maybe shattered memories

[3:03:11] <%AdamTheJaggi> is this boat in drydock or something, where's the sway? it'd be cool is stuff in the boat levels moved with the ships tossing in the rough seas
[3:03:12] <%Hammerknife> even before all the goo this has to be like the least appealing swimming pool ever

[3:07:13] <CrypticMochi> I need a case study for this
[3:07:14] <%PanicSwytch> When are getting Elmo stares as?
[3:07:14] <+waltzqueen> ELECTIRCAL CURRENTS
[3:07:15] <Monkeyweed21> THATS HOW THE PUZZLE WORKS PAT

[3:07:17] <+Zereaux> videogarms pat
[3:07:17] <%NekoUrabe> Woolie pool
[3:07:17] <%shurtal> puzzle solution is to untangle them, that's it
[3:07:18] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt it wanted you to make sure all the nodes were in the edges without them crossing the wires
[3:07:19] <%asgard147> "Father! Mother! I can see everything." psaPorgmo
[3:07:19] <%arsonistdaria> WHY WOULD IT MATTER IF WIRES ARE TANGLED?!

[3:07:33] <%ElkRiverDog> Can’t cross the streams!
[3:07:33] <SoySocks> @PatStaresAt it would make more sense if the wires had a visual effect like sparks if the wires were crossing and shorting out

[3:07:55] <%cursedwithadhd> yea and why does sun puzzles work in a cave
[3:07:56] <%tusk102> @SoySocks they literally light up yellow when he has the wires in the right place

[3:08:04] <saiduq25> Do you remember which part of the game made you stop playing it?
[3:08:04] <%xUmbraNinja> How

[3:08:11] <yourliteraldog> Expecting comon sense in a RE puzzle/ progression obstacle. Really Pat.
[3:08:11] <%PanicSwytch> WE WANT CLEAVAGE PAT
[3:08:13] <%realm_forge> THE ORB IS REVEALED
[3:08:15] <%Dragon_Batman> The lines glow orange when your doing it right
[3:08:15] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @SoySocks They do have a visual cue. The wires light up when they aren't crossed, and are dull when they are crossed.
[3:08:15] <ammobasket> doesn't make physical sense, no
[3:08:15] <dan_g_v> shot the eggs on the ceiling?
[3:08:16] <%SvenHolgersson> Bless your heart Pat
[3:08:16] <%ForlornCarton> The wires crossing each other shorts them out
[3:08:17] <%GraceTBM> it's a puzzle in an RE game you dumbass, sense isn't relevant
[3:08:17] <natebud> just stop
[3:08:18] <%SolidusRex> NO THEY WEREN'T PAT
[3:08:18] <mobius_won> what's a short circuit lol
[3:08:19] <nademonkey1100> THATS THE PUZZLE
[3:08:19] <RevolverBobkat> The fact that Pat can tie his shoes is a miracle. I can only imagine how hard of a time it gives him
[3:08:20] <b_ikki> its okay pat dont worry bless your heart
[3:08:20] <C24U> Who playing the organ?
[3:08:21] <+trekkie11041> YEAH BUT THEY WERE CROSSED
[3:08:22] <TwistedVerse> Pat, you ignorant slut!
[3:08:22] <%Modren83> Pat you're dumb
[3:08:23] <enby_shout> TTours TTours TTours TTours

[3:08:23] <gade177> Pat just move on.
[3:08:24] <Monkeyweed21> it's literally just untangle the wires pat
[3:08:25] <%Shadowpint> Remember RE3's gear puzzle where you had an arbitrary number of moves for no reason
[3:08:25] <%D3rrtyD4n> WHAT A CRUISE SHIP
[3:08:25] <leinadtonu> don't worry about it
[3:08:28] <Skelex> what resident evil puzzle has ever made sense
[3:08:29] <%asgard147> "Father, why must you strip infront of me?" psaPorgmo
[3:08:29] <mattynezz> Remember when Paige was the one who was bad at puzzles?
[3:08:30] <+Press_X_ToJASON> literally heated LUL
[3:08:31] <%trustycoyote> The wires were causing a short. Game version of fixing a circuit
[3:08:31] <%tank7013> Pat why do you translate not getting the reason for the puzzle into not getting the puzzle?
[3:08:32] <AnacondaVirtue> Listen to this fucking Dracula music
[3:08:32] <twistedj3ster> I love this rooom
[3:08:35] <b_ikki> shhhh
[3:08:36] <%Punchasaur> “Why would I have to solve the puzzle to do it right”
[3:08:36] <+CryptusMaximus> *steamy music as eggman attempts to fight physics*
[3:08:36] <redrins> nodes have to be on the lights and all the wires must glow, therefore they cant be crossed and have to be on top and bottom
[3:08:37] <hlreiku> Be like Elsa
[3:08:37] <yourliteraldog> Dame those some dummy thick cheeks
[3:08:37] <trianglehat> let it go Pat
[3:08:37] <%shadowace2400> They're always connected, but they can't be crossed
[3:08:38] <enby_shout> SHORT CIRCUT
[3:08:38] <SoySocks> @PatStaresAt they could be shorting out
[3:08:38] <wrydiculous> pat imagine those were exposed cables
[3:08:38] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> short circuit
[3:08:39] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt why does it matter if it makes sense about the tangling???
[3:08:39] <+Zereaux> let it go
[3:08:39] <Manwad> EMI
[3:08:39] <%SirGO0SE> psaWink
[3:08:39] <%SvenHolgersson> IT WAS A PUZZLE

[3:08:42] <+waltzqueen> BUT BABA
[3:08:42] <%nofestu2> WHO CARES
[3:08:42] <mobius_won> bare wires will short out
[3:08:42] <%GraceTBM> cause it's a fuckin videogame
[3:08:43] <+trekkie11041> YOUR IOVERTHINKJNG IT
[3:08:43] <+Brandonxman> how many of those puzzles are in this game since i want to see him do more
[3:08:45] <%shadowace2400> CAUSE THAT'S THE PUZZLE
[3:08:45] <Psych_man13_13> Why must pat be at constant war with chat?
[3:08:46] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> music is very MediEvil

[3:08:47] <%arsonistdaria> You're not an electrician are you
[3:08:49] <%SvenHolgersson> WHY WOULD YOU MAKE A SHADOW OF A BIRD TO OPEN SOMETHING
[3:08:49] <+Skelegroove> It is barely a puzzle
[3:08:49] <gade177> OH MY GOSH PAT!
[3:08:50] <mattynezz> Pat knows the answer, he's playing it up to hide his regular levels of dumb
[3:08:50] <%discozombi> Omg he's still on this LUL
[3:08:51] <yourliteraldog> MAGNETIC FEILDS
[3:08:51] <nademonkey1100> just give up chat
[3:08:52] <C24U> That isn't how electrical circuits work Pat
[3:08:52] <TwistedVerse> do puzzle, shoot dog
[3:08:52] <%SvenHolgersson> IT MAKES NO SENSE
[3:08:52] <%Dragon_Batman> HAve you ever played with a tangled remote, it's annoying as fuck
[3:08:53] <SoySocks> short circuit if they aren't insulated
[3:08:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> because it's a puzzle.
[3:08:54] <hlreiku> Ghost boat
[3:08:54] <natebud> It's acalled a short circuit
[3:08:54] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt just do the puzzle who CARES if wires don't make sense in the game
[3:08:54] <%lionandfox21> Its the difference between an DC system and an AC system
[3:08:55] <leinadtonu> that's what makes it a puzzle.
[3:08:56] <%shurtal> cause it's a DUMB VIDEO GAME THAT WANTS YOU TO SOLVE IT THE CORRECT WAY
[3:08:56] <mobius_won> not bare wires
[3:08:57] <YourOpinionSucks> THIS IS A BAD BIT
[3:08:57] <%JackKrauser> 2 hours from now: BUT WIRES!
[3:08:57] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> yours were insulated, those werent
[3:08:57] <sothatsprettybrutal> this is a very stupid argument
[3:08:58] <enby_shout> did the coating exist
[3:08:58] <%Estuko> just discovered I had a "vintage" 1995 ronin warriors ryo toy just hanging out and I never realized it the past 15 years.
[3:08:58] <YakumoYomi> Johnny Five, alive!
[3:08:59] <Manwad> Special wires
[3:08:59] <%TheMattman1313> Not bare-sopper ones
[3:09:00] <42nfl19> WERE THEY LIVE WIERES?
[3:09:00] <+sham_> CROSS THE STREAMS AND DIE
[3:09:02] <%sleepy_coffee> Video game logic, buddy
[3:09:02] <gade177> IT'S RE NOTHING MAKES SENSE.
[3:09:02] <startstoprepeat> why does making a line of tetris blocks make them disappear
[3:09:02] <%SvenHolgersson> WHY ARTE THESE CROCODILE PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND
[3:09:02] <%trustycoyote> Well apparently these had no insulation!
[3:09:03] <freelancebabymaker> GOD is DEAD
[3:09:04] <%Jekado> wired tangled can't understand BOW's total fine science
[3:09:04] <twistedj3ster> these are unshielded
[3:09:04] <%asgard147> Elmo so cute limesAw psaWink
[3:09:05] <%rytisone> cause they were insulated
[3:09:05] <%Karglin> Of anything in resident evil, wires being tangled and shorting makes the most sense pat
[3:09:05] <%SvenHolgersson> I DONT GET IT
[3:09:05] <%shadowace2400> the tangled wires were insulated
[3:09:06] <%Typhaeon> The sun doesn't work right in this world
[3:09:06] <Drivershaft> what tangled ass wires you be workin
[3:09:08] <Monkeyweed21> NOT IF THE WIRING IS EXPOSED JACKASS
[3:09:08] <%discozombi> Pat it's just the game, it's fine
[3:09:11] <+theotherkristian> SPRITI of the CompetTion
[3:09:11] <%jemeralddragoon> i went to pee, is Pat seriously still on about crossed wires?
[3:09:11] <%D3rrtyD4n> all the wires in my pc are tangled atpCap
[3:09:14] <$PhantomMiG> The interior detailing is pretty nice
[3:09:14] <%mankeytennis> Remember this was a 3ds game with the stylus
[3:09:15] <%Typhaeon> Why should electricity not working right be a surprise
[3:09:16] <Skelex> these are wire puzzle locks with tangle detectors
[3:09:17] <frozenottsel> Because an electrician was cheap and bought uninsulated wires.
[3:09:19] <+trekkie11041> PAT BRAIN DONT GET SIMPLE PUZZLE
[3:09:19] <The7thCrownLessKing> stop trying to justify it pat
[3:09:19] <wrydiculous> video game wires
[3:09:24] <gamezerox> Emblem puzzle in games : makes sense.

[3:09:48] <%Arazien> @patstaresat Spencer or someone made the wire puzzle and that is why it's absurd I guess
[3:09:49] <saiduq25> Is this room a recreation from dead aim?
[3:09:51] <+Press_X_ToJASON> "these puzzles" says man who has failed puzzles in every game in this series so far

[3:10:05] <%lionandfox21> DEAD AIM
[3:10:07] <+trekkie11041> dead aim was first\
[3:10:07] <%Dragon_Batman> Dead aim probably
[3:10:08] <+TheDeadpoolDash> The first mistake was using real world logic vs video game logic to solve a video game puzzle.
[3:10:09] <KeiPrime> dead aim came out way before its on the ps2 for chrissakes
[3:10:12] <%SnapIntoaTimJim> Dead aim was ps2..
[3:10:12] <%rytisone> dead aim 2003 i think
[3:10:13] <tactician0> pat & paige are junior jumble and crossword puzzles
[3:10:13] <%GraceTBM> uhhh, dead aim came out before revelations
[3:10:13] <Drivershaft> dead aim was on ps too
[3:10:16] <BoneofMalkav> Pat, A man has fallen into the river of Lego City. LUL
[3:10:18] <%D3rrtyD4n> dead aim is hot garbage

[3:10:35] <dukenux> LUL
[3:10:36] <%tusk102> THAT WOULD BE THE TITS
[3:10:36] <tigerfang86> T I T S
[3:10:37] <twistedj3ster> Dracula called, he wants his Castlevania soundtrack back
[3:10:41] <SoySocks> "It's just a puzzle" is such a weak mindset
[3:10:41] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> those are the worst 2 characters hands down
[3:10:41] <hlreiku> This is jill butt the game
[3:10:42] <natebud> The character's name is literally "Jackass"
[3:10:43] <%RobotPancake> I love that someone takes to the time to make a not like "Damn all these monsters is crazy! I'm outta here"
[3:10:43] <black_pariah> THE TECH SUPPORT DUO SUCKS
[3:10:44] <%discozombi> puppHaha
[3:10:45] <%jemeralddragoon> Dead Aim is PS2, i own it

[3:10:47] <%Ranryu692> I like that her wetsuit has a built in thong
[3:10:50] <C24U> That made you give up yet you could stand Steve?
[3:10:50] <+SlumberMan> That character's codename is literally Jackass.

[3:10:59] <%mankeytennis> Oh yeah the chucklefucks
[3:10:59] <DrkJP520> Dead Aim had very satisfying zombie headshot animations though.
[3:10:59] <%SvenHolgersson> And yours doesn't have a thing?
[3:11:03] <%TheMattman1313> Why does that sound like Steve?
[3:11:04] <%connos_procrastination> those guys are national heroes to be honest
[3:11:06] <+CryptusMaximus> Boy were you not ready for Moira then...
[3:11:09] <%asgard147> limesS
[3:11:11] <%tusk102> "Why does crossing matter?" is such a weak mindset.
[3:11:12] <%sleepy_coffee> Oh god the other two playable characters are the not good
[3:11:12] <%PauliusMaximus> oh this boss
[3:11:13] <natebud> Now fight itchy tasty in boss form
[3:11:15] <%KeystoneA1> MAY. DAY.
[3:11:18] <SkyPirateArcane> And that, boys and girls, is why you don't put a dynamic object in baked lighting
[3:11:18] <%GraceTBM> like re4's boxes that barely interacted with the lighting
[3:11:20] <bigdumbidiotguy> Scagdead is such a cool monster

[3:11:40] <SoySocks> Pat's OCD doesn't immediately kick in upon seeing crossed wires
[3:11:41] <enby_shout> uncrossed wires you pleb
[3:11:41] <TwistedVerse> IT'S CROSSBONES
[3:11:42] <%GraceTBM> 3d sniper scopes instead of overlays is so sick
[3:11:43] <+trekkie11041> MAAAAY DAAAAY
[3:11:44] <natebud> Gonna be wishing he put on that burst fire
[3:11:45] <tactician0> do I hear a cult chant?
[3:11:45] <islandoasis> this fight was a bit clunky, but it was fun
[3:11:48] <%D3rrtyD4n> endless supply of bones
[3:11:48] <%JackKrauser> I sense a Chainsaw man thing coming..
[3:11:48] <%KeystoneA1> BONES

[3:12:15] <yourliteraldog> BONE BALISTA
[3:12:21] <%GraceTBM> i'm probably gonna keep saying it but fuuuuuuck pulling out the scanner to pick up shit and get herbs
[3:12:22] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Chainsaw man? Power worst girl. Therefore, best.
[3:12:24] <bigdumbidiotguy> apparently this guy still is somewhat drifting out of consciousness and doesn't know he's mutated. kinda creepy.
[3:12:25] <TwistedVerse> pat's in the bone zone
[3:12:26] <saiduq25> Personally i loved dead aim dont get the hate for it.Then again it has been more than a decade since i played it
[3:12:26] <%Estuko> LUL
[3:12:27] <%tank7013> This boss used to creep me the hell out

[3:12:37] <KaseKaizer> monkaS
[3:12:38] <%DracaenaLeaf> who's talking
[3:12:40] <SomeAsianDood> @Puhff you should feel ashamed of yourself
[3:12:41] <Coystick> All 10 of those dollars were spent on the ass
[3:12:41] <enby_shout> i wish i could build this for 10 dollars
[3:12:43] <natebud> less than that'
[3:12:45] <%Laecerelius> Gotta save money somewhere to shape that massive ass
[3:12:46] <%connos_procrastination> this bit is cool tbh
[3:12:47] <%asgard147> limesS monkaS
[3:12:48] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> worldbrand is right, that is NOT a ten dollar ass

[3:13:10] <%ForlornCarton> Fire rate for rifle
[3:13:14] <bigdumbidiotguy> I would say honestly this is probably the best part of the game. or at least my favorite. very atmospheric
[3:13:14] <enby_shout> guys how many hours do you think went into that ass
[3:13:20] <C24U> I wish it told you what the parts did when you pick them up
[3:13:21] <TwistedVerse> 25h

[3:15:35] <%arancet> @PatStaresAt pro tip, when scanning, if theres something to scan in range the circle in bottom right will be yellow
[3:15:37] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> platinum games is actually named such because they had a stash of 200 metric tonnes of platinum hidden under the dev studio. All of that platinum was sold to pay the army of people who worked on designing 2B's ass
[3:15:37] <natebud> escape LUL
[3:15:37] <gollygee> for some reason Jill's face and hair in this game reminds me a lot of Sheba

[3:16:19] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> invisible walls

[3:18:17] <Psych_man13_13> So how did we get from this trash to the good game rev 2 is
[3:18:19] <%GraceTBM> @ThanksVideogames9 in my opinion, it's a game with moderate strengths and weak weaknesses
[3:18:19] <KeiPrime> or fuckin bear traps even
[3:18:19] <+trekkie11041> I WANT LIFE
[3:18:22] <gade177> Everyone needs cum.

[3:18:52] <alexandrecau> lot of health when you miss
[3:18:53] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the normal head is the weakpoint
[3:18:54] <DashXero> You and me both. That's where I quit.
[3:18:54] <%NekoUrabe> I believe
[3:18:55] <Crit_Chance> yeah, this guy gave me some trouble
[3:18:56] <%GraceTBM> and he barely responds to your actions

[3:19:06] <%tank7013> I forgot the sheer ridiculous number of adds the fight has
[3:19:09] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> looks like you're not CUT out for this
[3:19:10] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> pat, use the window
[3:19:14] <%kingbaconcrispy> Shoot the head, run, use the canisters. This boss kinda sucks.
[3:19:14] <%baronblank> I somehow missed the rifle and shotgun on the way to him and he was literally impossible to kill
[3:19:17] <trianglehat> good start
[3:19:22] <neVan0> SUCC
[3:19:23] <%rytyoung> it's funny hearing these enemies barks through quality audio instead of a 3ds speaker
[3:19:24] <%Dragon_Batman> Your like Paige with the trapping your self in the corner thing
[3:19:26] <MayorRev> why did you walk forward?
[3:19:27] <%JackKrauser> This boss was much harder on the 3DS.
[3:19:27] <SilverFaustX> this game looks terrible
[3:19:30] <natebud> Yeah, back into that corner
[3:19:31] <gade177> Why even open the door?
[3:19:32] <%kingbaconcrispy> Cheese him with the window also.
[3:19:32] <yourliteraldog> CUMMS OFFICER
[3:19:36] <TwistedVerse> WACK
[3:19:42] <%GraceTBM> chargin melee was a cool idea, but it makes the moves feel less snappy

[3:19:47] <enby_shout> officer cumms at yoru service
[3:19:47] <%RowenCleric> ....did he say "I need hug"?

[3:20:21] <+UnpronounceableName> LUL LUL
[3:20:22] <%D3rrtyD4n> the adds are annoying as fuck
[3:20:28] <%GraceTBM> also you gotta love the ENORMOUS hitbox on the enemies cause it was a handheld
[3:20:29] <+MrAtheGreat> Dodging works on him
[3:20:30] <gade177> All these guys need a hug.
[3:20:31] <%patriotrenegade> damn her butt tho
[3:20:35] <%Estuko> that's that.. RE5 animation when the character gets electricuted
[3:20:40] <Captain_Joe1911> Go Pat! BloodTrail

[3:20:50] <%rytyoung> Pat no stahp he's a hooman
[3:20:51] <+MrAtheGreat> keep mashing forward and a or back and a
[3:20:51] <%XzileGaming> "he looks like a monster to you?"
[3:20:52] <TwistedVerse> "im a huge man"
[3:20:54] <+MrAtheGreat> iirc
[3:20:59] <gade177> I like that it says stop.
[3:21:02] <Monkeyweed21> Capcpom just released the patch notes for the Netcode fix
[3:21:03] <%GraceTBM> isn't this dodge the one where you like, move at the same time the enemy attacks?
[3:21:11] <gade177> Makes it a little disturbing.
[3:21:12] <%Dragon_Batman> yea
[3:21:13] <enby_shout> 25 - 100 ass hours [Source ~ Chat ]
[3:21:16] <natebud> This is not a save your ammo boss, this is a shoot constantly boss.
[3:21:17] <trianglehat> Pat stop, he's a human
[3:21:22] <%GraceTBM> do the melee attacks hit more than one target?
[3:21:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> itchy, tasty hooman

[3:21:51] <Coystick> why dies he have a fish themed buzz saw?
[3:21:51] <%GraceTBM> if the dodge move was a button I absolutely would have completed this game
[3:21:53] <%mankeytennis> This guy spongier than a destiny boss
[3:21:54] <%rytyoung> @gracetbm they can, but it's hard since the enemies are huge
[3:21:54] <TwistedVerse> so many adds
[3:21:57] <gade177> @RavishingRiza The boss is. I don't know about the rest.
[3:21:58] <%jemeralddragoon> man fuck this part

[3:22:30] <%D3rrtyD4n> damn he's fast for a big boy
[3:22:34] <C24U> so it's easy to back and forth him on second floor

[3:23:21] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Parker knows what's up, damn.
[3:23:24] <%RowenCleric> is there no quick turn in this?
[3:23:28] <MayorRev> Is there no Quick Turn?
[3:23:29] <KeiPrime> there is a quick turn
[3:23:29] <%GraceTBM> for a 3ds game it was pretty impressive, but only while you were playing ON the 3ds
[3:23:31] <+superkeaton> These guys look like Vampire Coast units from Total Warhammer

[3:24:13] <%darthfodder> Not gonna lie, this game looks like dogshit to me. Would rather they went all in on a decent 3PS or survival horror, not worst of both worlds.

[3:42:07] <%thebeargoesHONK> thebeargoesHONK subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 14 month streak! Any plans to play the new Toejam and Earl game?
[3:42:09] <hlreiku> Pat? How played up was your fear during the shitstorm?
[3:42:10] <+Andrizzleton> good box music
[3:42:11] <%ShichiNoBushi> These doors open quickly from one way but take forever from the other. (I know they are loading doors, but it's pretty ridiculous.)
[3:42:18] <%Laecerelius> Is that gun you unlocked any good?
[3:42:20] <rilou501> "Evacuate ship!" * Waits for wheel lock*

[3:42:38] <BlackMage66652> How does this ship stay afloat with Jill's cheeks on board?
[3:42:40] <%Neo_Kaiser> Remember when that creepy cop walked up to Pat and asked what he was doing there and Pat screamed?
[3:42:40] <%Ronaxsis> @PatStaresAt have you heard of Kindred Fates? It's a monster-catcher rpg on kickstarter, it looks like its offering alot of what people have been asking from pokemon for tha last 10 years.
[3:42:41] <%ssjklyco> Oh, you should play PT on a stream
[3:42:41] <%connos_procrastination> @evbites depends on the BOW tbh

[3:44:53] <%Binary_Fireball> these doors are atrocious
[3:44:55] <rilou501> This is a weird room in ReR2

[3:45:14] <+Andrizzleton> atpSuspect
[3:45:15] <eldritchmoeblob> solarium is the room where you keep your solaire
[3:45:15] <+Zereaux> does it really
[3:45:15] <%Binary_Fireball> a pool in the basement just isn't as impressive
[3:45:18] <%worldbrand> as we all know
[3:45:21] <+metalsiren31> pvpHmm
[3:45:21] <natebud> sun room
[3:45:23] <DrkJP520> the room where you get high
[3:45:23] <+Stripe_dog> Is the ship still on reserve power?
[3:45:24] <enby_shout> whats the fish equivalent of small hat in terms of sexual prowess
[3:45:24] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> solar, from the Greek "high"
[3:45:24] <TwistedVerse> sun down, fish up
[3:45:25] <%Neo_Kaiser> I wonder if this cruise ship has a pornography store. For buying pornography.
[3:45:25] <mobiusnightshade> Solarium means PRAISE THE SUN! \[T]/
[3:45:25] <%Admiralpoosh> Admiralpoosh subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! 
[3:45:26] <%DarkestDawn64> Praise the Sun!

[3:45:29] <%NekoUrabe> Paige would be in there
[3:45:29] <%Punchasaur> pat r dum
[3:45:29] <+rascalrebel> it comes from the latin word rheaum which means sky-shit
[3:45:32] <YakumoYomi> I too wish to be grossly incandescent
[3:45:34] <+timmc916> sol means pool in latin
[3:45:35] <%dalishprince> the weed room
[3:45:35] <%Binary_Fireball> not like... sun room
[3:45:36] <hlreiku> This is why i hate video games because they feed into the male FANTASY
[3:45:36] <%Taisuru> It means "Solaire's Bedroom"
[3:45:37] <%SoFarFetched> NO SUN IS DOWN
[3:45:38] <tactician0> Is this the Persona 5 Ship as well?
[3:45:39] <TwistedVerse> you know who else is high
[3:45:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> it's where you go sunbathing on a cruise, of course.

[3:45:48] <%shurtal> The sun is taking that dank government weed
[3:45:48] <%tusk102> @Stripe_dog it's on "whatever amount we need" power
[3:45:48] <%darthfodder> Solarium is where you imprison the sun
[3:45:49] <trianglehat> but it's night in space
[3:45:49] <%dalishprince> the sun is just far away

[3:53:07] <Aydarkzero> this music is nice though
[3:53:08] <%Binary_Fireball> or are we in shitsville?

[3:54:17] <gade177> Fuck it got bigger!
[3:54:20] <%Jekado> charge can only be on handguns
[3:54:22] <+trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt charged shot goes and stays on mugnum

[3:54:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> Charge Shot Magnum could kill God
[3:54:31] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt put that shit on the magnum and it'll be the blue rose
[3:54:35] <Shion963> is it a Devil's Ruin now?
[3:54:39] <%SolidusRex> Charge Shot works for Magnum
[3:54:40] <startstoprepeat> unless i remember wrong, higher level charge shots can be used on other guns
[3:54:42] <%GraceTBM> tusk that's such a cool way to put it
[3:54:43] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt also it can only go on pistols or the magnum
[3:54:44] <%D3rrtyD4n> wow

[3:54:49] <C24U> Star Wars sound
[3:54:50] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That's pretty good
[3:54:51] <%sniffy77> Pat, if you could say one thi g to elmo, and he could understand everything perfectly, what would you say?
[3:54:51] <natebud> charge shot magnum is the way to go.
[3:54:52] <%srkAres> thats how guns work
[3:54:52] <%SolidusRex> That was a Star Wars sound effect
[3:54:54] <yourliteraldog> Thats fucking stupid I love it
[3:54:54] <%Dragon_Batman> It also makes a dum laser sound
[3:54:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> 's pretty gud
[3:54:58] <dullvivid> oh hewwo OwO
[3:54:59] <@commanderclaw> That's some Half Life 2 shit
[3:55:01] <%D3rrtyD4n> its kind of neat sounding, hope its powerful
[3:55:01] <KingVantq> Did pat get the machine gun ammo case at the pool?
[3:55:05] <+Zereaux> pull my devil trigger
[3:55:09] <%GraceTBM> you hold down the trigger for LONGER
[3:55:10] <%Typhaeon> It totally coils the spring more guys
[3:55:13] <+trekkie11041> there is magnus version you get later
[3:55:13] <%Jekado> if you hold down the trigger the bullet shoots harder
[3:55:13] <%croxeye> yes he did King
[3:55:13] <Run44forrest> idk about the damage increase
[3:55:15] <natebud> It makes a cod mosin sniper noise LUL
[3:55:17] <KaseKaizer> duh
[3:55:17] <%Typhaeon> Shoots more better faster
[3:55:19] <%Jekado> its illegal in california tho
[3:55:19] <enby_shout> wat
[3:55:19] <Aydarkzero> it's true
[3:55:20] <KeiPrime> you negative edge the shot, like an oicho throw
[3:55:20] <gade177> Seems legit.
[3:55:21] <%Laecerelius> That's how gun work
[3:55:22] <%WhereIsWill> these are the hard facts chat
[3:55:22] <stranger59> That's just science
[3:55:23] <C24U> Ever hold down a water hose?
[3:55:25] <%GraceTBM> lol jek
[3:55:26] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That is how it works, I am a gun man and I would know.
[3:55:26] <%misterspotswood> i wish my guns worked like that
[3:55:26] <%baronblank> he did get the ammo case at the pool
[3:55:30] <%mh9s> that's what they taught us in the boy scouts
[3:55:31] <scoopyoopydoo> Negative edge trigger lol
[3:55:33] <%Oxybe> MEGAMAN WAS CORRECT ALL ALONG
[3:55:33] <KingVantq> @croxeye looked away for a bit and missed it thanks
[3:55:34] <%Binary_Fireball> just like peepee
[3:55:34] <yourliteraldog> Paige has been revied from her overdose
[3:55:35] <+ALazo> I do that every time I go to the range
[3:55:36] <+Toblo1> Aw damnit, did I miss Scagdread?
[3:55:38] <Arek_1> Paige, what did you shoot?
[3:55:40] <%Hammerknife> that's just barret's L1 limit break. that's literally all he does in big shot
[3:55:43] <qo_op> did paige say words about beastars this strim?
[3:55:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and yeah, I forgot this one doesn't go on shotgun. I think there was one that did in Rev2, tho.
[3:55:44] <%srkAres> but sometimes you have to hold your hand infront of the gun to test if it actually shootsd
[3:55:47] <+Andrizzleton> Last of Us 2 ain't got shit on RE Rev customizations
[3:55:47] <%darthfodder> Pretty sure demolition ranch did a video on it.
[3:55:52] <YakumoYomi> You have to make a charging noise with your mouth for it to work in real life.
[3:55:52] <%NekoUrabe> @toblo1 yes
[3:55:56] <b_ikki> gambling deanGasm
[3:55:57] <Nekros4442> can you imagine a negative edge gun?
[3:55:59] <%Typhaeon> As evinced by the welcome mat reading "Casino"
[3:56:03] <%GraceTBM> to be fair, i do kinda appreciate that ammo cases do normalize a certain amount and type of weapons

[4:05:41] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It wasn't shrink wrapped in a shiny wetsuit either
[4:05:41] <%Crunchy_the_clown> Crunchy_the_clown subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Do you prefer blonde Jill or brunette Jill?
[4:05:42] <+AngelYoumou> It's the wetsuit accentuating the ass
[4:05:43] <@commanderclaw> I wanna be able to see myself in that ass
[4:05:43] <evbites> just that noise brings the game down
[4:05:44] <%Binary_Fireball> the butt crack is disturbing
[4:05:45] <%D3rrtyD4n> pew pew
[4:05:46] <BlackMage66652> I want this Jill to sit on my face
[4:05:46] <+thackattack00> when I played this game I was sorely dissapointed. her ass is absolutely not as humongous as the internet had me believe

[4:05:50] <%GraceTBM> so these guys ar only fun to fight once you have the charge shot??
[4:05:52] <+theotherkristian> The designers of the wetsuit did that KNOWING it was for her ass
[4:05:52] <%Binary_Fireball> not a real buttcrack
[4:05:53] <enby_shout> dude fanny pack covering 50 percent of the ass, and it's still enough to smother a whole nursery
[4:05:53] <%Frodiddly> why does that gun make the same noise as the rebel blasters in Star Wars
[4:05:53] <Manwad> shiney and vacuum sealed Kreygasm

[4:10:16] <saiduq25> Like really thinking about the whole Veltro cutscene. They could have easily just went ahead and unleashed the virus. No one knew it was them and they didnt even have an idea what the plan was or what was going on. They would have got away with it

[4:10:25] <+CutCombo> smg bb :gasmm
[4:10:29] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt since you're using the charge shot anyway, would using the more powerful 4 bullet mag gun+magazine upgrade+charge shot be more worth it?
[4:10:30] <$Dakuu75> dude, I hate it when you get the AMMO for the new gun... BEFORE the new-gun lol
[4:10:31] <%ForlornCarton> pick your handgun back up

[4:10:35] <Run44forrest> i dont think jill got paid for re3
[4:10:38] <%JD_Lars> There’s a radar when you scan. If it’s yellow it means a hidden item is nearby, I think
[4:10:39] <%Binary_Fireball> holy shit my mind is blown
[4:10:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> does not work on machine guns
[4:10:45] <%Laecerelius> make the charge faster?
[4:10:45] <%heartlesshealer> fire rate affects your rate of fire
[4:10:45] <%GraceTBM> goooodddd fuck not being able to have all 4 major gun types!
[4:10:46] <scoopyoopydoo> It ups your fire rate
[4:10:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> does it?
[4:10:49] <%Typhaeon> It seems to
[4:10:50] <+CutCombo> ehhh
[4:10:51] <%DensityD> firerate can suck my dick
[4:10:58] <%SirGO0SE> like 2.5
[4:11:05] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> rate your fire. 7, not quick enough
[4:11:05] <%Hammerknife> it probably doesn't affect charge shot time
[4:11:05] <evbites> @Punchasaur binary domain
[4:11:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oooh I see what your doin here
[4:11:13] <%Binary_Fireball> it's RE why would that be good?

[4:11:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> nice
[4:11:37] <%GraceTBM> fire rate is great on machine guns in RE games
[4:11:40] <%Punchasaur> @evbites I would agree if binary domain had a universe

[4:11:55] <Run44forrest> wait it does?
[4:11:58] <startstoprepeat> charge shot only applies to the first shot if you use burst, i tested it @PatStaresAt
[4:11:59] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt would it be more worth it to use the more powerful 4 shot variant of the pistols since you're gonna be charging anyway so the low fire rate wouldn't matter?
[4:12:00] <natebud> I think I saw some people hating on burst earlier, those people got anything to say?
[4:12:01] <%GraceTBM> isn't the machine gun pretty good?
