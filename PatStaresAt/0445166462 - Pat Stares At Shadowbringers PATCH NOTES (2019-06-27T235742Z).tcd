[0:23:51] <TheDiddlerz> Both the male and female reproductive organs are at the rear of the abdomen, but spiders don't mate by coupling these organs. Instead, the male deposits some sperm onto a small web and picks it up on the end of his pedipalps. When the female is in position, the male deposits the sperm in the female's genital opening.

[1:29:15] <Zafnick> Maybe they will actually integrate interrupting into bosses now.
[1:29:15] <xeros720> the interrupt is different than a stun
[1:29:17] <Thenuclearwalrus> Shield Swipe is 🦀
[1:29:18] <%Mekhet09> shield bash is a stun.
[1:29:19] <%Farples> Sheild bash is still there
[1:29:23] <ChoculaUltra> kinda expecting the Gunbreaker teacher being a Garlean tbh.

[1:29:39] <+metalsiren31> That was always a fun one. "Hey let's see if I can stun thi- OH NOPE I'M DEAD"
[1:29:40] <+chronopaladin> charge is dope

[1:30:37] <pmtriox> good riddance
[1:30:38] <Thenuclearwalrus> @TerryTheTurret When you heal a target below a certain amount of hp (like 5%) you get a bunch of LB gauge, so groups would use healer LB after a big hit and gain a bunch of LB, some fights you could get 6 LB3s during the fight
[1:30:41] <%crowsloft77> no more petting Carbuncles

[1:31:08] <+metalsiren31> Nerf parrying. Give Gunbreaker a parry cooldown
[1:31:08] <bashful_bard> The biggest thing with high ping nin is just to make sure your ninjutsu input registers before hitting a gcd
[1:31:09] <Thenuclearwalrus> @AngriestPat Its because Tanks have a constant 20% damage reduction as a trait
[1:31:10] <TerryTheTurret> @Thenuclearwalrus Dang okay I see why they'd fix that.
[1:31:11] <%ESP_ROOT> hehh
[1:31:12] <+metalsiren31> pvpSass
[1:31:13] <A_Red_Robot> Shelton got better at least

[1:35:08] <%spiritofmojave> copied fucking city
[1:35:09] <wirblewomble> hey I just saw there's a dragoon class in monster hunter world, can i play that instead of ff14?
[1:35:09] <+chronopaladin> that's some dang SMT shit
[1:35:10] <%thebeargoesHONK> Temple of the Sun
[1:35:14] <%zedreamcast> That looks like an SMT dungeon
[1:35:16] <xeros720> just in dungeons
[1:35:17] <+TombstoneTTromboners> NANI
[1:35:19] <%HiroTSK5> When's FFIII's World of Darkness?
[1:35:19] <haisho> chain bonus in instanced dungeons only
[1:35:21] <Calamity2007> It looks like the lead up to Innocense
[1:35:23] <%QuadraticGravity> Because mass pulling the entire dungeon is a bad habit you ass
[1:35:24] <Ultimatefool> BLAME ALPHINAUD
[1:35:26] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat What do you think about the six area being Garlea?
[1:35:26] <bashful_bard> It's the shadowlord's castle Pat
[1:35:27] <+hazzy_o7> Cause ppl would pull to first boss and leave
[1:35:27] <%Mekhet09> chain bonus is shit.
[1:35:27] <%MisterTylerrr> I love this system
[1:35:31] <wirblewomble> FF14 IS FF11 NOW
[1:35:31] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat it's cuz ppl were just spamming the first room of dungeons to level
[1:35:32] <%ESP_ROOT> alphinaud is just a baby
[1:35:33] <Reddhero12> they already added that @HiroTSK5
[1:35:34] <Calamity2007> Fuck you Alphanud
[1:35:38] <Reddhero12> it's a 24 man dungeon in ARR @HiroTSK5
[1:35:39] <inksmears> love u alphainud ;_;
[1:35:39] <Alanprotocol> Baby boy
[1:35:39] <+TheImmortal70> Mass pulling is a bad habit if your party can't handle it
[1:35:40] <%Laecerelius> WoD was in the first alliance raid
[1:35:43] <%yeknomlive> you have to complete it first to do it
[1:35:45] <Monkeyweed21> Alphinaud adjust
[1:35:48] <inksmears> NOT LESS EXP
[1:35:49] <%Innocuous_Goat> And each character has unique interactions and dialogue with the dungeon
[1:35:49] <Calamity2007> But Dialogue tho
[1:35:51] <chris_babaganoosh05> Alphinaud is a big gay baby and Ilberd did nothing wrong
[1:35:51] <inksmears> THAT'S NOT TRUE PAT
[1:35:52] <%MisterTylerrr> That's fine just to get through msq
[1:35:52] <+sanoblaze> "I sure love everyone TOTALLY not wanting to fuck my sister"
[1:35:55] <+metalsiren31> Pull all the things
[1:35:55] <%DedlokPM> I think the 2.6 GB one is for base game and the 7 GB one is for those that have all the expansions/shadowbringers because I restarted my Free Trial launcher and it is still the 2.6 GB
[1:35:55] <Tucker0603> WRONG
[1:35:56] <+Masutasodo> THE MOON
[1:35:58] <ColRedyx> The removal of xp chains and exp buff probably normalized exp gain no matter how long a dungeon takes, to remove an incentive for speed running. Which doesn't matter, people will still speed run, but chains punished slow players.
[1:35:58] <pmtriox> it should be
[1:35:58] <blackbeaking> less exp and gear? fuck that shit
[1:35:59] <xeros720> is it worth doing Command missions at all?
[1:36:01] <%Mekhet09> That's not true Pat.
[1:36:02] <%QuadraticGravity> COLORS WEAVE
[1:36:03] <+Karasseram> Yoship said all zones are on the first
[1:36:05] <%spiritofmojave> it's only less gear rolls I think Pat
[1:36:05] <%crimsonharvest> i want that fuckin FF4 moon music
[1:36:05] <+chronopaladin> oh dang, alphi is wearing my favorite mage shirt
[1:36:06] <%ESP_ROOT> great
[1:36:06] <Finakala> The Moon 6th area
[1:36:07] <%MyDarkStorm> Fuck .34mb
[1:36:08] <$OmegaWeltall> i dont wanna go in dungeons with other players, they'er bad
[1:36:09] <Calamity2007> CRAZY TALK
[1:36:10] <A_Red_Robot> The First is the World of Light, though
[1:36:11] <Tucker0603> NOT LESS EXP
[1:36:14] <%orihsnek> moon is 7.0
[1:36:17] <xeros720> oh shit yeah, FF4 type stuff
[1:36:20] <AcidicHorizon> 4 MB YEET
[1:36:22] <chris_babaganoosh05> Ready to ERP in dungeons with Alisaie boys
[1:36:24] <%zedreamcast> So minfilia is now a rogue
[1:36:25] <Ultimatefool> Minfillia has her own class? wtf??
[1:36:25] <Latija> Zodiark is technically the moon, would make sense
[1:36:26] <+TheImmortal70> It's not less exp and it's less gear because the current amount of gear is with 4 player parties in mind
[1:36:28] <ChoculaUltra> when did Urianger become UrianBAE tho
[1:36:30] <%Fatmanjoggin> It's gonna be the sun
[1:36:31] <@mothmandraws> dark knight tataru
[1:36:32] <+sanoblaze> is it Hildy?
[1:36:32] <+SirBearic> you get the same EXP in trusts, you do get fewer gear drops though
[1:36:32] <laughingsquid> wha wha WHO
[1:36:32] <bashful_bard> Players will be better than trusts
[1:36:33] <%MisterTylerrr> Someone pm me who the other 2 are plz
[1:36:33] <%Straylightgg> Give me Cid you cowards
[1:36:35] <%Laecerelius> Moon’s haunted
[1:36:37] <+213372bu> botany and fishing endgame on the moon PogChamp
[1:36:38] <%Gogogolem> oh and the thing with the increase to over xp. Is because people would do massive pulls and get themselves killed to get better chains. So its to stop that.
[1:36:38] <laughingsquid> HILDY??
[1:36:40] <+TheImmortal70> It'd be stupid to get the same amount of gear and just get free gear
[1:36:42] <%ESP_ROOT> rad

[1:57:01] <haisho> party finder linking is gonna be great for S ranks
[1:57:02] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@arcaderabbit48) (warning)
[1:57:05] <+Edrem> Because then you can't see if they alos need healing

[1:57:21] <%Craytonex> thats goofy thats gonna get fixed
[1:57:23] <+hazzy_o7> You need to see the HP for stuff like White Hole
[1:57:27] <+TheImmortal70> You can make a transparent shield bar
[1:57:27] <Bailey__gaming> ELMO IS SPOOK
[1:57:27] <+oOZtkOo> the shield could block health if the shield was higher
[1:57:29] <Nina96> so whats replacing protect? or is there nothing?

[1:58:16] <%Typhaeon> The color scheme isn't bad
[1:58:16] <%ElenaManetta> Why
[1:58:16] <+DrYay> Was the highlight color of the buttons on the bottom of the launcher hot pink before or did they just change that for some reason?

[1:59:27] <Latija> wait what was that? actualy dialogue
[1:59:29] <+Edrem> can never go above 90fps
[1:59:30] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat the fps cap is now 90
[1:59:32] <%SpcOpsBear> what about the FPS cap pat
[1:59:35] <chris_babaganoosh05> Job guide!
[1:59:37] <+Edrem> Hard cap of 90
[1:59:39] <SomersaultJustice> pets have ascended
[1:59:45] <@mothmandraws> NEW MUSIC CONFIRMED HOLY SHIT
[1:59:50] <%Gogogolem> scholars dead
[1:59:58] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> burn in hell gauss barrel
[2:00:02] <+TheImmortal70> This is the same as with Stormblood
[2:00:04] <Thenuclearwalrus> @AngriestPat Stuff breaks past 90 fps like Physics
[2:00:04] <%sshen> should be capped at 60 for jiggle physics
[2:00:08] <Afroperonista> WTF
[2:00:09] <+StrawberryPantsu> dont nee144fps
[2:00:12] <%doggettxalex> reee
[2:00:13] <Calamity2007> FPS cap isn't really an issue
[2:00:15] <BinaryShuffle> not 144 PunOko
[2:00:16] <@mothmandraws> 12 billion fps
[2:00:16] <+StrawberryPantsu> 60 is fine
[2:00:17] <GMKGoat> Rip 144hz users
[2:00:18] <xeros720> heard some people having trouble with the fps caps on their rigs, so be ready
[2:00:21] <thelaughingjakal> Oh shit patch is up?

[2:00:22] <+Promessa_EX> unlock the frames plebs
[2:00:23] <+UberWolfman> OH NO
[2:00:24] <+smevvster> Game physics broke past 90fps bruh.
[2:00:25] <%arcaderabbit48> Why would you even need it at 90?
[2:00:26] <+TheImmortal70> FPS cap is only important for reducing input lag
[2:00:28] <SilentGaming49> 13 billion dead fps
[2:00:28] <+hazzy_o7> Their fps cap adds input lag
[2:00:42] <+Delror> holy crap the xpac install is slow as hell
[2:00:42] <%spiritofmojave> Good, kick the lala that stands in place for 6 days in a spot
[2:00:44] <+junks2300> FC is reporting their patchers just crashed. Mine did too.
[2:00:45] <NemokillerV> dangit launcher died again
[2:00:45] <%sshen> People will still clip out of world using speed hacks or cheat engine, fps cap changes nothing there
[2:00:46] <+UberWolfman> Check ur download for real
[2:00:46] <+junks2300> Time to check
[2:00:55] <+Zxtole> Hopefully they fix it someday for higher frame rates

[2:01:04] <%OdysseyKnight> Bye Plague
[2:01:04] <chris_babaganoosh05> Get fucked trial babbies
[2:01:06] <xeros720> stuff i saw had the 60 fps cap knocking them down to 25 or so, so you might want to set up something to limit it besides ff14 itself
[2:01:08] <%Craytonex> woooooo
[2:01:12] <SilentGaming49> Thank god I bought those 60 days
[2:01:12] <vonmaultke> FeelsBadMan

[2:01:34] <%arcaderabbit48> @Macfine Usually they don't have to
[2:01:34] <Calamity2007> I love the whole splitting the light sky aesthetic
[2:01:34] <%crowsloft77> jesus this patch's girth is increasing
[2:01:35] <+TheImmortal70> My patch is literally less to download now
[2:01:40] <+TheImmortal70> What the fuck is happening
[2:01:40] <Thenuclearwalrus> MAC SUCKS
[2:01:42] <Thenuclearwalrus> LUL

[2:01:52] <+valkuma> @AngriestPat Check patcher it crashed again
[2:01:53] <Derkinstacker> Patch crashes, but you keep progress even though you start at 0%
[2:01:54] <+EmperorWeeb> my patch actually got smaller
[2:01:55] <%Schrodingers_Box> 208 Minutes.
[2:01:56] <KnivesEve> just crashed on me
[2:01:57] <%spiritofmojave> ???
[2:01:57] <suikudo> wat
[2:02:07] <%demegodz> Okay...
[2:02:07] <+StrawberryPantsu> Ha
[2:02:08] <+UberWolfman> Patch crashed
[2:02:09] <%BudaBryan> @AngriestPat Should I get into FF 14 now, even though I dont have that much free time or is it too much of a time commitment like most MMOs Cheer1000
[2:02:10] <Afroperonista> like moonwalk in wow?
[2:02:10] <%BudaBryan> reward A Cheer shared Rewards to 25 others in Chat!
[2:02:11] <+Kise77> Yes
[2:02:11] <Thalchampz> i imagine it's legacy camera
[2:02:12] <+213372bu> Yeah,
[2:02:12] <pmtriox> shouldn't be jumping anyway
[2:02:13] <+StrawberryPantsu> cant check
[2:02:13] <%MysteryFaceX> I wonder if they'll add Player versus Scions now that the Trust system has been implemented?
[2:02:13] <SolidScorpion> yes
[2:02:14] <%MyDarkStorm> YES
[2:02:14] <%QuadraticGravity> Legacy is the one for bad people
[2:02:14] <Otatoptohami> will probably face forward after jumping
[2:02:14] <indig0bird> The one that you use
[2:02:14] <%Taisuru> Yes
[2:02:16] <+Vostroyan1> yeah it is
[2:02:17] <ColRedyx> That's the one smart players use. You use it.
[2:02:17] <SolidScorpion> Thanks for the PridePan @budabryan
[2:02:17] <+Rose_Silver> yes
[2:02:17] <%skizzuto> yes
[2:02:18] <+BlancoRico> yes
[2:02:18] <+213372bu> Legacy is the best
[2:02:19] <laughingsquid> i dont use legacy
[2:02:19] <NemokillerV> Yes
[2:02:20] <+TombstoneTTromboners> legacy is free movement
[2:02:20] <+Koagz> my patch also crashed
[2:02:21] <%yeknomlive> yeah legacy is instead of back pedaling you turn
[2:02:21] <%SpcOpsBear> @AngriestPat This is the control type where moving with the left stick actually reorients the player
[2:02:21] <%Halowood> Pat that's what you use
[2:02:22] <+Edrem> Thanks for the PrideAsexual @budabryan
[2:02:22] <Fujiwara_92> yes
[2:02:23] <%Hobojo153> Legacy lets you walk towards camera
[2:02:23] <Nina96> legacy
[2:02:23] <+TheImmortal70> Yeah but when it kept progress before, it showed the progress being the same instead of downright removing the download stuff from the bar
[2:02:23] <Brannax> Yeh except me
[2:02:24] <+hazzy_o7> Legacy is for cool ppl
[2:02:25] <undagi> i don't
[2:02:25] <+TombstoneTTromboners> the other is tank controls
[2:02:25] <+2DSuperiority> You need a Mac Pro Stand to play XIV now
[2:02:25] <saulic1234> dont us it
[2:02:27] <pmtriox> patch pat
[2:02:27] <%tinyswampthing> Thanks for the PrideGive @budabryan
[2:02:27] <Pallion_> Legacy good. Standard bad.
[2:02:28] <+Rose_Silver> legacy is the good one on controllers

[2:02:30] <ColRedyx> Legacy is the correct style, you do use it.
[2:02:31] <+TheSaintJohn> Legacy is the default console control scheme
[2:02:31] <+Spiralofvertigo> It's the one I use
[2:02:33] <ColRedyx> But read the next line
[2:02:35] <+Stereotreme> Legacy is the one that doesn't screw you with backstepping
[2:02:37] <@mothmandraws> pat you should watch your guide to FF controls to find out
[2:02:38] <+213372bu> legacy= all ways run new = slow back movement
[2:02:39] <%Schrodingers_Box> Am i being silly or is there a way to get on the discord? Not sure what else to do now linked
[2:02:40] <%Taisuru> It's just jumping puzzles
[2:02:42] <+TombstoneTTromboners> F
[2:02:44] <Brannax> Ya'll aint taking away my backpedal
[2:02:45] <+StrawberryPantsu> M&K is the only way
[2:02:45] <%MyDarkStorm> Pat you use Legacy
[2:02:46] <suikudo> Launcher crashes are making me nervous
[2:02:47] <+Blackmage9999> weird
[2:02:47] <%Craytonex> f
[2:02:47] <chris_babaganoosh05> Legacy is where you turn around to run if you try to go backwards instead of backpedalling
[2:02:48] <%spiritofmojave> yeah.. :(
[2:02:52] <%elxinon> keeps crashing omegalul
[2:02:52] <@mothmandraws> mine crashed
[2:02:53] <bashful_bard> It's amazing on controllers, y'all nerds are dumb
[2:02:53] <Thalchampz> yeah...
[2:02:56] <xeros720> feels like it's something they put in to stop some of the bots
[2:02:56] <%Taisuru> AngriestPatch
[2:02:56] <+diazflak> I prefer Vintage controls
[2:02:56] <Calamity2007> Mine hasn't crashed yet :)

[2:03:07] <%Taisuru> PansexualPride
[2:03:08] <%Fidel_Castbro> its Paige and Pat
[2:03:08] <ColRedyx> "As this is not considered to have a major impact on gameplay..." Sounds like it's mainly a visual bug.

[2:03:12] <KnivesEve> just download it tomorrow
[2:03:13] <+DrYay> Why is it called legacy anyway? Wouldn’t the other one be called legacy since it’s closer to older MMOs
[2:03:14] <%Derbisol> 3 hours left for me
[2:03:15] <%puhff> I hope they never fix it
[2:03:15] <FrozenMonkey> rbzSmrt

[2:04:13] <Nina96> wtf is happening?
[2:04:14] <suikudo> It takes into account how much you downloaded
[2:04:15] <%QuadraticGravity> Maybe wait for it to finalize before you DDOS them
[2:04:15] <%templar010> It did
[2:04:15] <%Hobojo153> But it's less this time
[2:04:15] <+robobeau> Isn't there a maintenance window happening RIGHT NOW?

[2:09:29] <BappoSama> @AngriestPat What would be the best Ranged DPS class that's not an Archer?
[2:09:30] <r_Foeburden87> its a stun not an interrupt
[2:09:45] <JaeStereo> wait a tank stance BEFORE dungeon levels? this changes EVERYTHING
[2:09:51] <+Darren716> Best sci fi movie ever made
[2:09:54] <%MaddyCaddy> Woo!
[2:09:55] <%TombstoneTTromboners> nice
[2:09:56] <%QuadraticGravity> THAtS SO EARLY

[2:10:03] <A_Red_Robot> Nice. PLD gauge getting more use earlier
[2:10:03] <ScrubTheNerd> Yeah but it's not good now
[2:10:08] <%ESP_ROOT> damn
[2:10:08] <arbiduck> Shields UP
[2:10:08] <%spiritofmojave> man that's a drastic shift in level req
[2:10:08] <%skizzuto> they did nerf blocking tho
[2:10:09] <indig0bird> Wow, that's fantastic
[2:10:09] <%crowsloft77> Truly the best thing FF ever produced doodSteve
[2:10:10] <haisho> BIG MITIGATE
[2:10:10] <%MaddyCaddy> Time to have a button to press in low level dungeons to lower the gauge
[2:10:10] <xeros720> blocks and parries are weaker now though, right?
[2:10:12] <%MisterTylerrr> Mmnn
[2:10:12] <%spiritofmojave> good
[2:10:16] <Boxbunnytheliar> God I don't know if I want to level paladin or Dark Knight first
[2:10:17] <%hussdogrob> hey I'm having trouble with Discord mods who can help an eyeball out
[2:10:20] <greendino12345> where can i find these changes?
[2:10:24] <%zedreamcast> yup blocks and parries are weaker
[2:10:26] <+Vostroyan1> yeah blocks are "weaker" now though. however much that is
[2:10:27] <indig0bird> AoE combo yay!
[2:10:30] <xeros720> although, there's the standard 20% damage reduction on tanks, so i wonder if that adds upt o more or less
[2:10:31] <+StrawberryPantsu> @boxbunnytheliar PLD
[2:10:32] <%MysteryFaceX> I wonder what happens to job quests with skills that are part of the story?
[2:10:37] <OvaryPunch123> I looked at the Bard Changes. 90% of it was hella buffs and I'm a happy boy.
[2:10:43] <+StrawberryPantsu> or WAR
[2:10:44] <%Bigdrifter210> Great now i gotta redo my hotbar and relearn PLD
[2:10:45] <%Gogogolem> paladins are so boring
[2:10:48] <%MaddyCaddy> Gun has a hallowed ground lite
[2:10:53] <thetyrantcbass> If nothing else, getting utility early will be great for Palace
[2:10:53] <%Divryne> Goring more like BORING.
[2:10:55] <%MaddyCaddy> The 1 hp thing still sucks
[2:10:57] <JojoPiero> Block used to scale, Parry was a auto20, so maybe they pushed both to 15?
[2:11:01] <$valriot> BIG DOT
[2:11:02] <indig0bird> GNB has shitty Hallowed Grond
[2:11:05] <Zafnick> Hallowed ground is the worst invuln though
[2:11:10] <%MysteryFaceX> @OvaryPunch123 But Dancer took all the fun of support out of Bard.
[2:11:17] <indig0bird> After 60
[2:11:31] <+StrawberryPantsu> Hollowed ground is the best invul
[2:11:34] <MoulesFritz> good lord he's actually reading every patch note
[2:11:42] <MoulesFritz> i thought it was a joke
[2:11:42] <OvaryPunch123> @MysteryFaceX Ya that's true
[2:11:59] <SnapKick> @AngriestPat Hallowed is by no means the most powerful, with a 7 minute CD you can use it maybe once a fight, or like 3 twice a dungeon, where you shouldn't be needing invlun anyways
[2:12:03] <Zafnick> @StrawberryPantsu No it isn't, Holmgang is because you can plan to use it multiple times in a fight
[2:12:07] <%MaddyCaddy> Nearly 2000 people enjoying watching a man read
[2:12:08] <%MaddyCaddy> yay
[2:12:09] <indig0bird> Blocking was nerfed overall
[2:12:10] <Nina96> @MoulesFritz pat never jokes about 14
[2:12:24] <xeros720> that Cover type cone is really cool
[2:12:33] <r_Foeburden87> p0ally bubble
[2:12:33] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> @MysteryFaceX Dancer seduced Bard and took its utility
[2:12:40] <+Fenris_Alexius> Holmgang will continue to be the best ultimate tank CD
[2:12:41] <saulic1234> 3 min left
[2:12:41] <%Finaldragoon> CHARGING STAR
[2:12:47] <%DavidSanChan> i loved that in wsg in wow
[2:12:47] <%MaddyCaddy> They nerfed Holmgang
[2:12:51] <%Reanimator83> Listening while playing Judgement
[2:12:51] <%MysteryFaceX> Now Bards are just idiots who sing to encourage themselves.
[2:12:54] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Paige has become the hudge
[2:12:58] <jackythefrost> They hard nerfed Halmgang dude
[2:12:58] <%demegodz> Nice SFX
[2:13:00] <%Mekhet09> Even nerfed it still has the best CD.
[2:13:01] <soliammurr> omg he did the animation
[2:13:08] <Ziginski> 100% accurate
[2:13:11] <xeros720> yeah, it looked like bards' self buff a lot more
[2:13:12] <Nitaino> lol
[2:13:15] <Afroperonista> confettior
[2:13:20] <Thalchampz> BIG damage
[2:13:22] <+smevvster> 1200 when buffed by Requiescat
[2:13:23] <Reireizei> elmoooo
[2:13:23] <JojoPiero> It does 1200 with Req up
[2:13:23] <+Hertzeil> 1200 if you do it right
[2:13:25] <%QuadraticGravity> Contiteor does the same damage as Midare Setsugekka
[2:13:25] <Nitaino> @AngriestPat hello how are you
[2:13:26] <%hussdogrob> @mekhet09 hey who should I talk to about Discord issues?

[2:13:44] <+smevvster> AOE with no falloff too
[2:13:44] <Tsarwerewolf> Hi Paige
[2:13:45] <%SvenHolgersson> MMOS are filled with losers lmao
[2:13:46] <+Vostroyan1> WAIT. do I no longer have to remember to switch to shield oath?
[2:13:48] <JojoPiero> NO Falloff, 1200 AoE, fuckov Dam Age
[2:13:48] <ScrubTheNerd> Shield Swipe was the best, what are you talking about?

[2:14:11] <%yeknomlive> what are you talking about drk got the most
[2:14:12] <arbiduck> @xstormyone You use it as a finisher after a few Holy circle casts at the end of Requiescat's buff window
[2:14:15] <Thalchampz> @A_Red_Robot what you mean, DRK gets a goddman stand

[2:17:32] <CurrySauseBandit> @Mekhet09 I agree, it's pretty numbing.
[2:17:33] <hotsu_doggsu> all the validness to aoes for melee reminds me of Hevansward
[2:17:44] <%MysteryFaceX> @smevvster Oh, I know. I just thought Interrupt might be superior as so many bosses are immune to Stun. Though I don't know how often Interrupt works on bosses either.
[2:17:53] <%TykoWeisz> TykoWeisz subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:17:59] <pmtriox> so darkside is a thing you unlock with stuff instead of a set it and forget it
[2:18:01] <%Gogogolem> Is it useful now?

[2:18:14] <Calamity2007> Ow the edge
[2:18:15] <+metalsiren31> Blood Weapon was amazing what are you talking about
[2:18:20] <+Stereotreme> DRK is Dragoon now
[2:18:22] <Zafnick> Wait, is edge and flood of darkness an oGCD?
[2:18:27] <+smevvster> Darkside also doesn't disable your mana regeneration.
[2:18:28] <xeros720> yup
[2:18:30] <pmtriox> cool
[2:18:31] <SnapKick> @MysteryFaceX It's the same thing as magic damage mit vs straight damage mit. They seem to think having very niche skills makes classes cooler
[2:18:36] <%Divryne> Think Blood of the Dragon.
[2:18:36] <xeros720> it really is a melee dps class that tanks
[2:18:37] <%Taisuru> @Stereotreme No, it's NIN, it's NIN's pinwheel
[2:18:38] <ColRedyx> Darkside is now a buff like Heavy Thrust and Dark Arts is a stacking buff that gets consumed on use.
[2:18:39] <%crowsloft77> yeah, drk looks like it's just tank drg now
[2:18:52] <haisho> you're just a tank dragoon
[2:18:54] <Fien111> It's FINE, Pat.
[2:18:57] <Derkinstacker> Heavy thrust was a weapon skill though.
[2:18:59] <%DavidSanChan> playing baba irl
[2:19:00] <xeros720> so is gunbreaker, i think, but gunbreaker has a weird combo gimmick
[2:19:04] <Zafnick> I thought they where GCDs, I was like "god this sucks now" but if they are oGCDs thats sweet

[2:19:29] <Mastigias> why!?
[2:19:29] <%spiritofmojave> oof
[2:19:30] <+smevvster> Likely to reduce it's use in single target scenarios.
[2:19:31] <hotsu_doggsu> D E L E T E altey earth
[2:19:31] <%Craytonex> life of the dragoon is really fun to use
[2:19:32] <xeros720> a lot of the floor aoes are weaker across the board, i'm not sure why
[2:19:33] <haisho> because salt

[2:19:35] <jackythefrost> Ouch

[2:19:51] <%spiritofmojave> well unleash is way better now
[2:19:51] <ScrubTheNerd> AOE bad, I guess
[2:19:51] <+Moaradin> probably because AOE in general is better now
[2:19:51] <Monkeyweed21> salty DoRKs
[2:19:52] <%MysteryFaceX> No Blood Gauge either!
[2:19:54] <ColRedyx> Because DRK has a lot more AOE now, keeping old SE might have been overkill?
[2:19:55] <JojoPiero> Free AoE is why
[2:19:56] <+metalsiren31> Salted Earth BibleThump
[2:19:57] <Basch71> before had to use mp for abyssal drain

[2:20:01] <oceanmatt> screm

[2:28:37] <+CynicalCobalt> Pile Bunker!
[2:28:38] <tetriata> What's the point of writing "UPDATED" beside each class when every class is updated?
[2:28:39] <CastellanVon> Don't worry Square doesn't give a shit about healers as well
[2:28:42] <%Unlimited_> GUN
[2:28:45] <+SlowLikeThunder> Machinist, the third new class added by Shadowbringers
[2:28:47] <+Greywyn00> the wall of revisions LUL
[2:28:47] <Monkeyweed21> DoRK
[2:28:53] <TheWildOnion> It feels like Dragoon should just say "We made everything hit harder. You're welcome."
[2:28:58] <xeros720> ahaha, the new class jokes are hilarious
[2:29:05] <@mothmandraws> thats on aa few
[2:29:07] <%kewlmyc> apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo
[2:29:07] <+TheImmortal70> Yeah it's great
[2:29:07] <Mastigias> It's just a new job now
[2:29:09] <%ESP_ROOT> great
[2:29:09] <%yeknomlive> it's a combo now
[2:29:11] <+Icenrose> wow, that's an overhaul, then
[2:29:11] <DjFrostBite95> 👏
[2:29:11] <indig0bird> GOOD
[2:29:12] <torgairon> @tetriata because people are married to their classes, and will take great offense if they don't think they are new and shiny
[2:29:15] <ColRedyx> Ehhhhhh.......
[2:29:16] <xeros720> instead of the dumb ammo mechanic, it goes straight to heat and battery gauage
[2:29:21] <bashful_bard> Now dnc has them LUL
[2:29:22] <%Craytonex> is McH viable now
[2:29:29] <Afroperonista> all revisions
[2:29:33] <haisho> that's just Life Surge without a heal!
[2:29:37] <xeros720> dancer builds them up and spends them, so it makes more sense
[2:29:39] <pandangerous> it was already viable what do you mean
[2:29:42] <A_Red_Robot> MCH seems like less of a mess, but I still don't know how I feel about it
[2:29:44] <SomersaultJustice> it looks like reassemble applies to all of the aoe move now?
[2:29:44] <+mik255> heavy thrust was the worst move
[2:29:46] <%ESP_ROOT> great
[2:29:47] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> PFFFT LUL
[2:29:47] <%Laecerelius> Hey DRG lost a combo starter. That’s something I guess
[2:29:49] <%elxinon> level jump?
[2:29:50] <%spiritofmojave> MCH won't be the hipster class now, good
[2:29:52] <%ESP_ROOT> 54?
[2:29:52] <ColRedyx> No combo branches, no procs... cool spell effects, but the gameplay looks extremely boring.
[2:29:57] <Thenuclearwalrus> @Craytonex MCH was always viable it was just the most annoying thing to play, but a good MCH was actually good dps
[2:29:58] <%ESP_ROOT> was the move that useless at 54?
[2:29:59] <%sshen> I wish I didnt have 170 ping so I could play MCH
[2:30:08] <+TheImmortal70> DRG got bar cleanup and had a bunch of damage increases
[2:30:14] <@mothmandraws> im trying to work out what my new combo will be in dragoon button wise
[2:30:16] <%zedreamcast> heat and battery
[2:30:26] <@mothmandraws> still seems wierd not doing heavy thrust
[2:30:33] <+TheImmortal70> I mean you still do heavy thrust
[2:30:33] <Thenuclearwalrus> Looks like SE is letting people Download in waves
[2:30:35] <%ESP_ROOT> rad
[2:30:35] <%yeknomlive> well kinda. you wanna weave gauss rounds and ricochet
[2:30:36] <@mothmandraws> or impulse drive
[2:30:40] <+TheImmortal70> It's just a part of your other rotation
[2:30:41] <%Craytonex> @thenuclearwalrus i've only ran with a few good McH so i kinda just saw them as whatever
[2:30:47] <@mothmandraws> feels like im missing first 2 moves
[2:30:48] <+LiveStreamOnyx> Heatblast? The alien from Ben 10?
[2:30:51] <Reireizei> pew pew pew :3
[2:31:01] <%ESP_ROOT> i really wanna play this class. i need my potato to be a cowgirl
[2:31:02] <ColRedyx> @mothmandraws You'll start with True Thrust and do the rest of the combo normally.
[2:31:06] <+TheImmortal70> Instead of being a single hit positional that isn't a combo
[2:31:10] <xeros720> hooray, Wildfire
[2:31:13] <+Ace5335> 120 SECONDS
[2:31:15] <@mothmandraws> ye it just seems wierd
[2:31:28] <%MysteryFaceX> I wish they kept the Bishop turret and the Rook and Bishop gattais in the Queen!
[2:31:32] <torgairon> auto crossbow? LUL
[2:31:34] <%hussdogrob> hussdogrob subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Howdy! I'm from Chicago and work with the Murder Mystery Company it's not Pat's bag but if Paige ever wants to check it out and is coming to town lemme know and we can have a comp ticket for her. its a three course meal as well (being dinner theatre)
[2:31:40] <%galaxyswirl> i see the bow!
[2:31:40] <torgairon> sounds like a tech downgrade
[2:31:41] <xeros720> god, that'd be sick
[2:31:42] <ColRedyx> @mothmandraws DRG just has the same combo structure now that tanks have had forever.
[2:31:45] <@mothmandraws> as ive spent 60% of game when heavy was like 1/3 of the buttons I used in game
[2:31:47] <%galaxyswirl> and a bio
[2:31:53] <JojoPiero> She took the pen is
[2:31:54] <Calamity2007> YEAH EDGAR
[2:31:58] <blackbeaking> mothman same it's gonna be weird not having heavy or impulse
[2:32:02] <%galaxyswirl> DRILL
[2:32:07] <Reireizei> wait these are edgar moves from FF6 :D
[2:32:09] <@mothmandraws> heavy-true-full or whatever it was
[2:32:10] <%MoraMiarty> has he gone over the drg changes yet
[2:32:10] <ColRedyx> @mothmandraws Yeah for sure but you're still low level. Heavy Thrust is 1/11th of the rotation at 70.
[2:32:12] <%DavidSanChan> pats pen is being grabbed by peach

[2:41:49] <suikudo> if they ask what type of coke it better be diet or fucking cherry
[2:41:49] <%Schrodingers_Box> Pepsi Max with Rasberry
[2:41:50] <$Thatghostpepper> @anarchywolves it works great on all of them
[2:41:50] <%Derbisol> Drinking Pepsi < Eating literal paper

[2:42:10] <%Wallabri> carbonated beverage
[2:42:11] <+2DSuperiority> All soda is Dr.Pepper because that's the only good one
[2:42:13] <StripedBlackTie> Lemonade isn't a cola
[2:42:16] <haisho> Coca Cola is jumping into the Energy Drink business here in Hong Kong. We now got COKE ENERGY

[2:43:12] <OldDarkwraith> @AngriestPat Only people in the south and mid west call all soda coke
[2:43:14] <Futurecity10> From what I've seen of crafting, its nothing really bad or good

[2:51:45] <Reddhero12> @Futurecity10 dark knight is getting some cool changes so I think you'll like it in Shadowbringers. the quest line for it is also amazing. But seriously, don't unsync boss battles. They're the only cool parts of the base game, at least enjoy them lol

[2:52:31] <Nina96> same
[2:52:32] <%spiritofmojave> Garuda is an enjoyable fight, but most the stuff comes close end of post ARR stuff
[2:52:35] <+hoenhime344> @jackythefrost you can if you are strictly speaking about MY individual time played. and how I view fun. hence warframe is the better game.
