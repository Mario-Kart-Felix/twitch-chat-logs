[0:06:19] <$Pompadourius> I love Fire Emblem, but not warriors games LUL
[0:06:19] <%machshop> i'm tired of seein it
[0:06:19] <$ringabal> THEY'RE GONNA AGE OF CALAMITY THE TIMELINE

[0:06:20] <Blank9> fire emblem warriors had good framerate though
[0:06:21] <%MegadBlitz> okay so play this game when it's on a console that can HANDLE THE FPS
[0:06:21] <+TopTieramisu> people love husbandos and waifus
[0:06:22] <+justianxix> Hell yeah
[0:06:22] <@Ranryu692> it's one of the oldest Nintendo franchises
[0:06:22] <%Monkeyweed21> One Piece, Gundam, and Zelda are the good ones
[0:06:22] <+HexForest> I like actual Fire Emblem, not this
[0:06:22] <phatmac16> No
[0:06:23] <DXLelouch24> chat are you insane?

[0:06:24] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Fire Emblem is Bleach
[0:06:26] <Shwepie> Wasn't only the first Hyrule Warriors a hit and everything else was meh?
[0:06:27] <Weeabooninja> I like FE, fuck Musou thogh
[0:06:27] <wifishine> Apparently

[0:06:28] <%Monkeyweed21> LOOK AT THAT OC
[0:06:28] <+vexingsruzz> Yes, just not Warriors.
[0:06:29] <+abrupt_abe> Fire Emblem  7 is my favorite game :(
[0:06:29] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> Fire Emblem Warriors was good, it had a 60fps mode
[0:06:29] <+gargoylecube> fire emblem is for npcs
[0:06:29] <thebalticguy1> three houses was great
[0:06:30] <agadejobi> I'd care if it was new!
[0:06:30] <+Rofiarf> feheroes made a billion dollars
[0:06:31] <%baka_sugoi> i like da gurl
[0:06:31] <+DGenerator> Always held onto the belief people who don't like musuo pretend it's good when Nintendo does it.
[0:06:32] <@Fuggins4U> someone's happy about that
[0:06:32] <mattdaddyd365> this one has a great ass

[0:06:34] <boofybaps> I LOVE fire emblem.... not warriors...
[0:06:35] <%JoshManVGH> Hyrule Warriors 2 was great AND it ran like ass. How's that fit in the formula?
[0:06:37] <djblue_shift> did the direct just start?
[0:06:38] <+pectusumbra> Lot of people care about Fire Emblem. Their FE gacha hit 1 billion in revenue this year
[0:06:39] <%Monkeyweed21> LOOK AT P4A OC MAN WITH TWO SWORDS
[0:06:39] <$PinkertonDanPie> why are the licensed spinoff Musou games so much better than the mainline Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors entries
[0:06:41] <neraren> 4 months, good turnaround
[0:06:42] <%sniffy77> how many war crimes will you do to be the fire emblem
[0:06:42] <thebalticguy1> WHERE DOROTHEA

[0:06:50] <raknikmik> Fire Emblem is fantastic. Warriors was also the best musou game
[0:06:52] <+historybowler89> I like Persona strikers but I thought fire emblem warriors was a bit of a flop
[0:06:53] <+pectusumbra> @djblue_shift yes
[0:06:53] <+MechaGoblin> How do the Warrior switch games work emulated?
[0:06:54] <%Hobojo153> Strikers was great so hopes are high

[0:33:04] <+0neReeler> ringfit was like the balanceboard.. a thing for a while
[0:33:04] <StoicMoogle> Ring Fit Adventure already does the job with fitness/weight loss but its no Sports
[0:33:04] <boofybaps> Ringfit was arguably more successful at it
[0:33:05] <+justianxix> because ring fit sold out
[0:33:05] <phatkat1454> this makes volleyball look so boring
[0:33:07] <%kyh9> RING FIT IS BETTER
[0:33:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's cuz it didn't have a scale that told you when you were fat

[0:46:25] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> doesn't the Chrono Cross cancel out the Front Mission?
[0:46:25] <+Prism_Zet> front mission, is great,  nothing else particularily exciting, BUT they did feed the furry porn machine instantly
[0:46:25] <%legendfather_of_giants> also a promise about FM 2

[0:47:35] <+saltpiggu> into a much cooler outfit
[0:47:36] <deviljhojho_> just sandbag the sub pajamas
[0:47:36] <$Pompadourius> XC2 is one of the best games I've ever played, but the start of it sucks
[0:47:37] <TurtlesAndTentacles> but sword boobs
[0:47:37] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> He does get a costume upgrade at the like 85% mark iirc but yeah

[0:47:42] <Solidnick18> slept like a baby
[0:47:42] <$Futurecity10> I will not be supporting xb3, fuck Xenoblade for selling out
[0:47:43] <rosemon5001> the XUSSY
[0:47:43] <%Hamborgini> If he just had normal pants, it'd be 1000x better
[0:47:44] <%AncelDeLambert> I gave XBC2 about 15 hours before dropping it, but that's because I hate offline MMO design
[0:47:45] <JobbedBone> ME?

[1:34:00] <%Bailey__Gaming> DANTE
[1:34:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Women do martial arts differently
[1:34:02] <%Aeogard> warrior and gunner are solid choices, i went assassin tho
[1:34:04] <+transporterthesequel> don' t listen to chat, servers only matter for guild and open world grouping. otherwise you can play with anyone for instance stuff

[1:35:35] <%SABiscotti> Oh that's just a GUNLANCE
[1:35:36] <Sunstalker> wo'olwind

[1:35:39] <Teyaric> that's not an homage. That's just THEFT
[1:35:39] <%AoiRob> THAT WAS WYVERN FIRE FUCK OFF
[1:35:40] <%HarmonicArsenal> that's blatant
[1:35:42] <%JoshManVGH> Neat! can it rocket jump?
[1:35:42] <wqorst> MH copied this game?
[1:35:42] <%ElMaestroChoque> theres also a dungeon system that is basically MH
[1:35:43] <heartlesshealer> oh wow
[1:35:43] <%strakillias> That looks stolen as shit.
[1:35:44] <%Nobrev> IT'S JUST MONSTER HUNTER
[1:35:44] <%redthebaron> oH
[1:35:45] <fatalDestiny> This game has so much that looks ripped straight from monhun.
[1:35:46] <jmepik> it even has the triple stab lmao
[1:35:47] <%Sora20030c> that's like straight ripped
[1:35:48] <%redthebaron> OH MAN
[1:35:48] <Tomschiii> i had so look up so many things to choose my class, tier lists, popularity, diffculty...and still cant choose
[1:35:50] <%Aeogard> @PatStaresAt Shadowhunter is just a WoW Demon Hunter
[1:35:50] <+transporterthesequel> oh yeah its mmo gunlance. straight up
[1:35:50] <+crazyspartan214> IT THE SAME\
[1:35:52] <$newtmcgoot> Diablo with juggles gg ez best diablo game
[1:35:54] <+killer_squid1990> GUNLANCER OWNS TOO IT'S TOP TIER
[1:35:54] <+Grayhammatter> that's just monster hunter
[1:35:54] <IwishIwasTaylorSwift> gunlance is cool
[1:35:54] <+twenty112> But ALSO a dragoon
[1:35:54] <%Aeoneth> Was that just Superbolide?
[1:35:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> is that legal?
[1:35:55] <+FirstFireKeeper> yeah warhammer 40k totally dident invent it
[1:35:55] <+alphonseisbest> ALSO CHARGE BLADE ALL DAY EVERY DAY
[1:35:55] <tcosmiclatte> it even has a counter stab
[1:35:56] <+DrifterRonin> Gunlance users are not bound by silly things like  "separate franchises".
[1:35:56] <%JoshManVGH> Good enough!
[1:35:57] <+teh_rawk> more games need a gunlanced
[1:35:59] <rasamune> Oh my god that was literally just Wyvern's Fire
[1:36:03] <%Agami23> gun lance but was that gun metal soul it just used?
[1:36:04] <Pookiedaexzile> But I thought Pat Said MMOS can't have Hit Stun
[1:36:04] <+セビー> gunlance is chads
[1:36:04] <zerointelligence000> the spread of classes for this game is the weirdest
[1:36:05] <%Sora20030c> Berserkers also just makes me think of Garen from league of legends
[1:36:07] <+transporterthesequel> its op as shit too
[1:36:10] <+Rachet20> Apparently Paladin has very little support?
[1:36:13] <jackistpayne> This doesn’t play like an MMO chat, it plays real time and feels GOOD
[1:36:13] <%MegadBlitz> even the animations are basically the same
[1:36:15] <%LorcaNomad> yup thats a paladin
[1:36:17] <lyzejag> BREAKDOWN
[1:36:19] <+NecDW4> Paladin does NOT play like paladin in Diablo, holw hell
[1:36:19] <%AoiRob> did i hear a bloodborne sound effect
[1:36:23] <%OrangeMDT> Man, why are some classes gender-locked…
[1:36:25] <%Nekros4442> good, take more cool shit from other games
[1:36:25] <+pectusumbra> So another stolen game game got it
[1:36:28] <heartlesshealer> Are those the only 3 advanced classes, or does the Mage have different ones?
[1:36:29] <$newtmcgoot> IT HAS JUGGLES
[1:36:33] <yourliteraldog> That actually makes huge sense
[1:36:34] <%Broand> It looks like dungeon and fighters only in top down view
[1:36:35] <jackistpayne> I’m playing Paladin, it’s good good but very support
[1:36:36] <%Birdigalore> @PatStaresAt Goes this game use the holy trinity?
[1:36:37] <+FirstFireKeeper> animations
[1:36:39] <%BubbaRands> Because Korea
[1:36:39] <%Aeogard> literally korean diablo mmorpg
[1:36:40] <%Birdigalore> *Does
[1:36:41] <jmepik> is there a pugilist
[1:36:43] <%LorcaNomad> fuck that
[1:36:44] <%Rumbutt> Korean MMOs love to gender lock
[1:36:44] <+buttdirt> isometric action-as-fuck MMO
[1:36:47] <LunarRemix> So shit?
[1:36:47] <BettyMwwaahh> sexism
[1:36:49] <+alphonseisbest> COOL
[1:36:49] <%AoiRob> so the ladies can do chun li poses
[1:36:50] <yourliteraldog> Gender Roles
[1:36:51] <%Brassnarwhal> i just want armored lady
[1:36:55] <+demon1103> because screw you thats why
[1:36:55] <Insectorbass> Korea doesn't care about gender politics
[1:36:56] <$newtmcgoot> they're genderlocked because dungeon fighter online
[1:36:56] <%MegadBlitz> meh give me manly women and femboys
[1:36:57] <%Brassnarwhal> give armor lady
[1:36:58] <zerointelligence000> it's a bit annoying that I can't be a big buff lady
[1:37:00] <+polothegreatest> like black dessert or tera
[1:37:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> 👀
[1:37:07] <Dr_Mooose> i
[1:37:10] <fatalDestiny> Oh nice
[1:37:11] <%Bailey__Gaming> what do that mean?
[1:37:11] <%redthebaron> oh
[1:37:11] <%JonathLP> YES
[1:37:13] <%LorcaNomad> THATS A GOOD FETURE
[1:37:14] <heartlesshealer> Info button shows NUMBERS
[1:37:14] <%sandrews> that's cool
[1:37:14] <tubit> pretty neat
[1:37:15] <%blastyoboots> very good
[1:37:15] <+transporterthesequel> holy shit!
[1:37:15] <@Ranryu692> oh shit!
[1:37:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> huh, lokk at that
[1:37:15] <+NecDW4> OHHH, i wondered what that would be
[1:37:15] <+teh_rawk> neat
[1:37:17] <+Grayhammatter> 👀
[1:37:18] <%JonathLP> I MADE IT HOME IN TIME
[1:37:19] <Maids4lyfe> that is neat
[1:37:20] <dan_g_v> because Asia
[1:37:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Women can't Be Warriors says Korea
[1:37:21] <%redthebaron> that is like server wide?
[1:37:21] <scempriss> Are they gendered but slightly different gameplay wise?
[1:37:22] <%BubbaRands> I REALLY LIKE THAT
[1:37:22] <+Deekman> SabaPing
[1:37:22] <+nikoloas_> oh damn thats nice
[1:37:24] <+pectusumbra> Let's be real it's locked for cheaper
[1:37:24] <+NecDW4> I figured it was just basic info on the class
[1:37:25] <%Bailey__Gaming> Explain?
[1:37:26] <jackistpayne> They even show advanced class
[1:37:27] <danraven> more male gunners than female, that's a lie
[1:37:31] <+Grayhammatter> i like that
[1:37:32] <no123450n> is that currently playing or characters created?
[1:37:36] <%cobalt_phoenix_> I really hate to be that guy but idk why i get the feeling this is one of those games that most people will try for a few weeks then never touch it
[1:37:36] <$ItsRatman> Male martial artists in dire need of love
[1:37:37] <%Sotetsu> Bards are cool
[1:37:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if im wrong then good
[1:37:52] <%LorcaNomad> why so?
[1:37:52] <Srthunda> looks fun
[1:37:53] <LunarRemix> Like players's class distribution?
[1:37:54] <+supersonic21> deadeye gunner is just devil may cry
[1:38:00] <jackistpayne> LUL
[1:38:00] <OldManDeckardCain> pat hates helping other people LUL
[1:38:04] <%LorcaNomad> ew
[1:38:04] <%Aeogard> @cobalt_phoenix_ likely because a lot of people will do that, but imo it has enough to attract a good core audience
[1:38:08] <Ipsenscastle> Hunting horn
[1:38:08] <+buttdirt> it is a support class
[1:38:11] <%Aeoneth> @cobalt_phoenix_ Same tbh.
[1:38:12] <+killer_squid1990> Bard is entirely support yea
[1:38:14] <%Mr_Pylon> Is that Bard just saying "Bard" when they activate abilities?
[1:38:16] <+FirstFireKeeper> @Pookiedaexzile but men cant assassinate so its swings and roundabouts
[1:38:18] <+NecDW4> Bard and Paly are HARD support classes
[1:38:21] <jackistpayne> You get WAY more moves
[1:38:21] <%redthebaron> i know diablo
[1:38:23] <%Aeogard> @PatStaresAt bard is the only one with a heal LUL
[1:38:24] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> megumin mode
[1:38:26] <fatalDestiny> That's just megumin.
[1:38:27] <jmepik> Meteor
[1:38:30] <Maids4lyfe> sorceress looks good
[1:38:31] <%debugdrawray_> love wizard combos
[1:38:35] <mrtanaka111> wow pat, you have more viewers than asmongold right now
[1:38:35] <+teh_rawk> do you get mega beefers like in dragons crown?
[1:38:38] <%Wyrmspirit> Wyrmspirit subscribed with Prime. 
[1:38:39] <zerointelligence000> when does this get released?
[1:38:40] <+IanDaKnight> Yo how censored is this game tho?
[1:38:41] <Pookiedaexzile> @Pookiedaexzile Our Big Dicks would get in the way
[1:38:45] <%JonathLP> Can't wait for him to check out SOULFIST
[1:38:45] <%LorcaNomad> that's alright I guess
[1:38:45] <$newtmcgoot> it's a warriors game
[1:38:49] <Tomschiii> truly difficult between artilary man, wardancer and soulfist...ugh
[1:38:50] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[1:38:51] <aubelechy> yeah enemies come in massive waves
[1:38:56] <vuetyris> its a BIG DAMANGE game

[1:39:09] <Frostydough1> It’s legit Diablo dude, its crazy
[1:39:09] <+FirstFireKeeper> well its a arpg
[1:39:11] <jackistpayne> The mobs do, the elite are elites
[1:39:17] <Maids4lyfe> warriors or gauntlet legends
[1:39:17] <%JonathLP> @PatStaresAt Tell me if you can figure out what inspired SOULFIST when you get there
[1:39:17] <%AoiRob> it's almost just a top down Musou game
[1:39:17] <+gerenago> big damage > do combo
[1:39:22] <%TacoFunBox> Yea this just looks like a better diablo
[1:39:24] <%KineticZen> Extra grindy
[1:39:25] <jmepik> notoriously grindy
[1:39:27] <BettyMwwaahh> extra and filled with micro
[1:39:28] <tubit> as in, you pay extra?

[1:40:03] <$newtmcgoot> korean mmo's are unusally most fun around level 40 and then devolve into one hit kill everything in the room as fast as possible

[1:41:42] <AllenDeadman> I don't really know what this game is
[1:41:42] <+Comtrya> Comtrya subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months!

[1:41:46] <%Birdigalore> Get rekt, penises!
[1:41:46] <%BubbaRands> So thats why no one plays male MA
[1:41:46] <%LorcaNomad> men can't punch says korea
[1:41:47] <+teh_rawk> probly why its population is so low
[1:41:47] <doster504> wait this game does gender locked classes gross
[1:41:47] <heartlesshealer> all punchboys are carbon copies
[1:41:48] <NireFuster> Boys get a singular (1) Goku
[1:41:49] <%legendfather_of_giants> because titties Pat

[2:05:41] <bearablepuns> 6 inch heels in sand. Ez
[2:05:44] <+Grayhammatter> that is just a machinist move
[2:05:45] <T_Sasquatch> @korean_random sigh
[2:05:46] <+BoboDaHobo> @theerabbi he said he'd never play it

[2:05:56] <+Grayhammatter> settings?
[2:05:58] <MayShip> do combo
[2:05:58] <doster504> do combo
[2:05:59] <%Aeogard> settings?
[2:06:05] <+Shady_Zaku> @mynameisrasus yea kinda!
[2:06:05] <NireFuster> I'm assuming that slow orb is just like the spinning move you can do with Force Edge where it's there to complement other moves?
[2:06:06] <%AnthroMetal> do combo
[2:06:10] <+Deosier> finally do combo
[2:06:11] <tanarath> @cobalt_phoenix_ Can't wait to see how he interprets that into established canon.
[2:06:12] <+Grayhammatter> DO COMBO
[2:06:12] <+aWanderingKaivo> it probably explodes when it actually hits an enemy or something.. it would be hilarious if it didn't though
[2:06:12] <TheeRabbi> why is this Nintendo Direct character so sexy
[2:06:22] <jackistpayne> Combo means you press the button multiple times and can cancel out
[2:06:22] <bearablepuns> do combo 4Head
[2:06:37] <%Aeogard> @PatStaresAt combo's are the same button pressed multiple times is all
[2:06:37] <jackistpayne> Mash for combo
[2:06:37] <%Aleate> She must stand there in that pose at all times
[2:06:48] <+Grayhammatter> pat, press the combo button again
[2:06:56] <mar_krow> Pose is life
[2:06:59] <Izendale> combo actually asks you to mash the button to do a followup
[2:07:08] <MayShip> another one

[2:07:37] <+TheAdMerlin> What was the point of spawning with ag un then?
[2:07:39] <+aWanderingKaivo> man this REALLY wants you to not use a controller
[2:07:41] <%Aleate> Why do item levels start at 50? Is there even anything under that? Why START at 50?
[2:07:43] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> @Aleate Menacingly.
[2:07:44] <+FirstFireKeeper> @ElMaestroChoque nah
[2:07:53] <%Wyrmspirit> is pat trying to make this game look bad or is it just a bad game?

[2:11:55] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Killing spree
[2:12:04] <DXLelouch24> @louie_salmon theres a stagger system
[2:12:04] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Louie_Salmon it almost makes me think of like stagger but without an animation for it

[2:12:39] <Daxalog> is this #sponsored?
[2:12:42] <$ItsRatman> He's never seen a gun before, go easy on him
[2:12:43] <%Aeogard> english VO for this game is so weird
[2:12:46] <What_Up_Duck> He's obviously referencing your sharp wit.
[2:12:51] <SilverFaustX> FF 6 pixel comes out in 2 weeks !
[2:12:52] <fragdar> do you think wools would like this game since its an MMO that monster have actually feedback from you hitting them? @PatStaresAt
[2:12:53] <+aWanderingKaivo> this all reeks of "this was designed for an earlier version of the game before you selected a class"
[2:12:53] <%OrangeMDT> I thought his arm was missing??
[2:13:04] <%Chichen> which founder pack did pat buy
[2:13:05] <+Vigonept> Coward
[2:13:11] <+KennyKRool> Was that Ichiban's VA?
[2:13:14] <+FirstFireKeeper> @Louie_Salmon well your fighting hordes, and eventually they will kill you in half a dozen hits, so its needed
[2:13:15] <DXLelouch24> Yea prob using the KR voicepack
[2:13:18] <%Wyrmspirit> pat just press RB + start to close windows...
[2:13:23] <TheLegendofNate> That gun animation feels very familiar
[2:13:24] <%MyNameIsRasus> It's real weird that only the first line is voice acted
[2:13:30] <%Rumbutt> Did Morpheus just give you a red potion
[2:13:30] <Tomschiii> you will need them
[2:13:32] <doster504> @Chichen every seperate one clogged up my steam store it was so annoying
[2:13:43] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Tough times ahead?
[2:13:44] <+Grayhammatter> you'll prolly need them
[2:13:47] <SilverFaustX> wow xenoblade is trending
[2:13:52] <yourliteraldog> So there is no dedicated healer class?
[2:13:55] <doster504> the oil keeps the sweat in
[2:13:57] <%cvp5127> dolls can sweat?
[2:13:59] <+Shady_Zaku> noice!
[2:14:08] <+KBGuilty> Buttchug 50 health potions
[2:14:22] <+FirstFireKeeper> @yourliteraldog bard is pretty close
[2:14:29] <%TerpanderLux> good
[2:14:30] <+aWanderingKaivo> @FirstFireKeeper just looks odd because they just stop entirely instead of having a stagger animation
[2:14:34] <Louie_Salmon> Boy, these are some menus
[2:14:34] <DXLelouch24> @yourliteraldog bard and pally
[2:14:35] <+Shady_Zaku> What did you think of the Front Mission news Pat?
[2:14:39] <$yeknomlive> no holy trinity. dps with diff utilities
[2:14:48] <+killer_squid1990> you have no skill points
[2:14:50] <%TerpanderLux> do it
[2:14:57] <CruxAustralis> talk to him
[2:14:59] <%Aeogard> you can drag and drop the skills on the left to your hotbar to change order and skills
[2:15:05] <CruxAustralis> just talk to the guy
[2:15:07] <%TerpanderLux> good
[2:15:13] <%Wyrmspirit> someome please tell him he can close windows with RB + start... he doesn't need to click the X every time
[2:15:17] <Louie_Salmon> This makes me appreciate the PoE sphere grid nightmare more, since at least it's all on one screen
[2:15:23] <%TerpanderLux> no
[2:15:25] <doster504> god I didn't even notice that was his name
[2:15:28] <%Birdigalore> Morpheus dorpheus

[2:15:37] <%Valdorick> Heard about the Arks? Nah, I'm lost about them.
[2:15:38] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I get the sense that the voice direction in this game is weak.
[2:15:38] <%TerpanderLux> the orcs
[2:15:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> where is it
[2:15:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> where ark

[2:16:02] <%Aeogard> @PocketBearIllustrator yeah sadly the KR VA is a lot better, but it has some audio issues rn
[2:16:03] <ShadeTheNovice> they wouldn't possibly be lost would they?
[2:16:05] <+FirstFireKeeper> @aWanderingKaivo you end up staggering them like ten times a second its to faced pace for an animation, think like a fighting game
[2:16:09] <%angryoptimist> I wasn't paying attention to literally any text in this game--this doofus is named MORPHEUS?!
[2:16:10] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Like Ark of the Covenant?
[2:16:10] <%Birdigalore> Go eat some walruses
[2:16:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> are those the arks?

[2:17:03] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @Aeogard It's a shame, but I've noticed some familiar voice actors who's done much better work elsewhere.

[2:19:07] <CarOden> Yeah, this looks like a MKB game
[2:19:11] <%ElMaestroChoque> 'partial controller support'
[2:19:16] <+noilkaizen> is pat liking this?
[2:19:19] <%Aeogard> im usually a big story/lore nerd but this is the first game ive really ignored it and just enjoyed the gameplay for
[2:19:21] <$yeknomlive> I also heard they controller support wasnt grest
[2:19:23] <+grenberr1> yeah, i tried doing it, decided to just learn keyboard
[2:19:44] <%HotSauceFiend> so is this fun?
[2:19:45] <%Aeogard> yeah its not worth controller, xbox controllers are also the only ones "supported" too
[2:19:47] <Chaoko99> someone explain to me quickly if this game is good or not
[2:19:48] <%ElMaestroChoque> blue arrow mean good
[2:19:52] <Chaoko99> I get big weird vibes from this
[2:19:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> lvl 60 this early on?
[2:19:58] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:20:03] <+aWanderingKaivo> it seems like it would be hard to not ignore the story in this so far
[2:20:05] <xbb1024> I would have thought an MMO is best played with mouse and keyboard
[2:20:08] <%TerpanderLux> yes
[2:20:11] <+FirstFireKeeper> they do
[2:20:13] <%NopeBadguy> this IS a diablo
[2:20:13] <%StaceMcGate> this game looks like the biggest gumbo of different genres ever
[2:20:15] <%BinaryFireball> so are you?
[2:20:19] <%BinaryFireball> oh he is
[2:20:22] <+Fetrigon> @chaoko99 it's good go watch a video
[2:20:27] <+alphonseisbest> @Chaoko99  no, make your own choices, will u die like a dog or FIGHT?
[2:20:31] <Zeif00> time to whip out the powercube
[2:20:32] <YamChop> yeah it breaks when you try to go to M&K after using controller, you have to go in to the settings and disable controller
[2:20:40] <%Aeogard> @Chaoko99 its weird and janky but has some real fun diablo  combat and some interesting mmorpg progression./mehchanics that will definitely garner an audience
[2:20:40] <%TerpanderLux> G
[2:20:43] <%StaceMcGate> LUL
[2:20:45] <doster504> @Chaoko99 gameplay might be good idk everything else looks like ass slime

[2:22:09] <+aWanderingKaivo> @Birdigalore wack
[2:22:19] <%MegadBlitz> when are we getting Crazy Talk caked up?
[2:22:32] <$yeknomlive> I think my fav hannibal skit is when his brother shows up
[2:22:56] <Chaoko99> @Fetrigon Personally I'd like to never seen as anything but honest.
[2:23:01] <%ElMaestroChoque> Some garbage is ok
[2:23:08] <Chaoko99> I'm willing to be wrong if it's actually super good and just looks like something I hate.
[2:23:23] <Chaoko99> Like I SUPER didn't like PSO2 when I first started playing it 9 years ago
[2:24:16] <%Aeogard> this game will be a super hit and miss for some people i find, but i think thats okay too
[2:24:26] <%Broand> I'm not sure if I'd call it diablo combat
[2:24:41] <%Birdigalore> I'm getting a Warriors vibe from the gameplay first impression: Fun for the first few hours but mind numbingly repetitive after that
[2:24:45] <+FirstFireKeeper> do you like arpgs you will probably like it, if not its not for you
[2:24:48] <%Broand> it looks like if you took some other korean mmos and just placed the camera over it like diablo
[2:24:51] <Chaoko99> Yeah that's fine. My reasoning is that there's a dude in one of my discords shitting it up with nothing but " O, thine lost ark mine only hope" lmao
[2:25:12] <Chaoko99> @Broand and this is exactly the impression I get
[2:25:32] <%Aeogard> yeah lost ark is cool but it is nowhere near perfect nor an mmo savior
[2:25:39] <%Aeogard> but mmo market is pretty sad right now, so LOL
[2:26:03] <%ElMaestroChoque> the environments and combat are pretty great. this early leveling period is insanely repetitive.
[2:26:07] <Chaoko99> I like PSO2, that's an ARPG but it'ss not a diablo for sure.
[2:26:09] <%Aeogard> anything even remotely fun automatically gets past the WoW barrier and has people frothing
[2:26:18] <%Birdigalore> Don't worry!  Riot's on its way to save us all...in like 10 years
[2:26:18] <%TheGreatSkenardo> TheGreatSkenardo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 48 months, currently on a 48 month streak! 4years wtf am I doing with my life and my munney
[2:26:19] <Chaoko99> Not much of a diablo guy either so I don't imagine I'd like it personally.
[2:26:24] <%Broand> It's closer to say, that Mabinogi side game. Or Dungeon and fighters
[2:26:36] <Chaoko99> at this point it's less about lost ark and more about the guy being annoying
[2:26:37] <Chaoko99> lol
[2:26:52] <%Broand> Yo real talk the wildest F2P mmo I played was Age of wushu
[2:26:57] <%Broand> that had some wacky stuff in it
[2:27:03] <%TerpanderLux> hi
[2:27:10] <Chaoko99> what's the "lets go" sample in the waiting track from?
[2:27:11] <%ElMaestroChoque> hey
[2:27:12] <Chaoko99> sounds familiar.
[2:27:19] <%TerpanderLux> monkaS
[2:27:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> did u find the ark?
[2:27:22] <%PocketBearIllustrator> psaElmostare psaElmostare psaElmostare psaElmostare
[2:27:42] <Chaoko99> that is WEIRD
[2:27:43] <+killer_squid1990> Some skills have what you're talking about, but not all
[2:27:59] <DXLelouch24> ok that sounds much better than PoE combat where you have to click
[2:28:06] <+UltraViolet371> that guy's grunting in monster hunter language
[2:28:15] <%ElMaestroChoque> some bindings are locked which sucks
[2:28:18] <boatzndhoez> dang this game looks like a 2012 game
[2:28:35] <Chaoko99> at least the frame rate apppears to be good
[2:28:44] <Chaoko99> the trailers gave me the feeling of like "this looks like it's gonna run at 29fps"?
[2:28:52] <Chaoko99> it has that sort of look to it
[2:29:02] <Insectorbass> This Divinity mod looks good
[2:29:07] <%Aeogard> yeah ive noticed very little frame dips and lag lately, tho its only early access rn
[2:29:09] <%Valdorick> Set them up the bomb
[2:29:17] <mrtanaka111> this looks boring af
