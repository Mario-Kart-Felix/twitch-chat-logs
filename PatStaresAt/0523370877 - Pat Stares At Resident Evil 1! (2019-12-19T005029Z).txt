[0:15:46] <Aydarkzero> 6
[0:15:46] <ajgilmore1> PS classic has it baybeee
[0:15:47] <HyperBomb21> RE1 is pretty primitive
[0:15:47] <SummonerMagno> no need to play the game, ive seen all the Milla Jovovich movies
[0:15:48] <Jkhmn12> I did have dino crisis which is way cooler when your ages 3-5
[0:15:48] <jcflyguy> "borderline"
[0:15:48] <Cosairen> jokes on you Midwest America is 20 years behind so I played it in its second heyday
[0:15:49] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> BakiinPlaysStuff subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! Damn near two years of this weird ginger orb and cube show almost down. I can smell that slightly more disgusting eyeball already. Thanks for the quality shit entertainment as always. Now get me hype for Re:3make like you did for 2 you wonderful person
[0:15:49] <+griffball13> RE1 is trying it's best
[0:15:50] <cureneckbeard> is skelmo cosplaying sailor moon
[0:15:50] <zaptar13> It's not THAT old just like you Pat. Slightly crusty.
[0:15:50] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> @AngriestPat OH THE JANK IS COMING SIR
[0:15:50] <%wannabemoogle> Its very rough
[0:15:51] <nbvewq> GameCube version
[0:15:51] <AMajorTom> well, RE2 just came out
[0:15:52] <Jacobpilk95> Used to watch my dad play it when I was 5.
[0:15:55] <+botchdogg> the colors are awful
[0:15:55] <vonpimpenstein> you are primitive pat
[0:15:56] <%vaporousTippler> RE1 was amazing when it came out, because Alone in the Dark looked like shit.
[0:15:56] <Snektor> Well yeah its a WELL AGED SANDWICH
[0:15:56] <+blondie_ow> RE1 is one of my favorites. I love how campy and cheesy it is.
[0:15:58] <Cerabret100> @AngriestPat the sterile empty simplicity of the prerendered backgrounds is striking
[0:16:01] <%NovaKnightmare> @angriestpat u doing original or director's cut?
[0:16:02] <Tracazoid> Yeah the environments are quite plain by comparison with RE2 and RE3.
[0:16:02] <%Laecerelius> I watched my 16 year old brother play it when it came out and the first zombie reveal scared the fuck outta me
[0:16:03] <deviljhojho_> right right
[0:16:03] <thedank> But OG RE1 definitely has it's charms
[0:16:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> Oh, Your almost a Jill sandwich
[0:16:04] <DracaenaLeaf> Jill Sandwich time
[0:16:05] <SvenHolgersson> Yea just like your opinion not toe play OPERATION RACCON CITY

[0:16:18] <%trustycoyote> Totally. Made the original game obsolete.
[0:16:20] <$8BitDsx> honestly I prefer Deadly Silence over REmake.
[0:16:22] <CyprienCole> @AngriestPat RE1 reminds me of alone in the dark
[0:16:23] <lionandfox21> THE MUSIC DON'T FORGET THE MUSIC
[0:16:23] <deviljhojho_> THE POLYGONS, WHAT DO THEY MEAN
[0:16:24] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat when are you playing Zero?

[0:16:46] <LethalPlacebo> @Th3SmartAlec That version only uprezzed the backgrounds, they weren't new or made from scratch
[0:16:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat You dont have to justify playing the REmake man its defnitively better

[0:21:53] <Graxe_> It's still RE6, so your opinion on it won't change all that much, but the PC version is the best version.
[0:21:55] <flyingtentaclemonster> I've been binge watching the old RE videos from the SBF channel but I guess Im doing this now lmao

[1:21:37] <+GeneralHysterics> no shit
[1:21:38] <+MrAtheGreat> Looks like Ace Attorney
[1:21:38] <Froyuken> Yeah. Wonder why that was taken out of 2 and 3.
[1:21:38] <jacksawjack> Instruction manual said she was Ex-Delta Force
[1:21:38] <Dhurkst> I love this feature!
[1:21:39] <derap41> So freaking neet
[1:21:39] <flyingtentaclemonster> MASTER OF UNLOCKING!!
[1:21:40] <+el_thag> Jill is a Lupin LUL

[1:21:41] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat It's like Phoenix Wright PogChamp

[1:21:47] <%TONYOO101> master of 3d models
[1:21:47] <residentfunko> OH that's the fucking game notification it sounds like steam just going the fuck off and freaking out
[1:21:48] <+jake_protagonist> I was actually really dissapointed when i got to 2 and that was gone
[1:21:49] <+botchdogg> Like apollo justice
[1:21:50] <+WarbossMetal> Isnt there a dead body with a note in there usually in remake?
[1:21:52] <Supervyxen> I know people who used to boot up Resident Evil whenever they had to draw a gun
[1:21:52] <@SSaryn> That is pretty nice for a PS1 full render.
[1:21:52] <rufus2k2> hmmm
[1:21:53] <AutechreTwinAphex> it came back in Code Veronica and RE2 Remake
[1:21:54] <grimm_hatter> cool but really dumb
[1:21:55] <+houseofnonsense> Yeah, I'm glad RE2 remake brought that back
[1:21:56] <derap41> Skyrim stole that
[1:21:57] <%TheMattman1313> tbh RE7 is full of that.
[1:21:57] <+el_thag> Also official gun names
[1:21:59] <+Deko_> PogChamp
[1:21:59] <42nfl19> Is @AngriestPat doing both runs?
[1:22:03] <+C24U> Is this the clown fart version of RE?
[1:22:06] <%Guardiansaiyan> @AutechreTwinAphex and RE7
[1:22:06] <cureneckbeard> pat controls
[1:22:06] <spoonbruh> No
[1:22:07] <rytisone> And that's why I got super stuck towards the end of the game first time I played it
[1:22:08] <+dheng1> Nah
[1:22:11] <Ion_Laser> @C24U nope
[1:22:11] <mayorrev> dong
[1:22:11] <Roz_Lynd> @AngriestPat so fun fact: shinji mikami, the guy who made this, also made a video game called "Sweet Home" which served as this game's main inspiration
[1:22:12] <rufus2k2> @C24U nope thankfully
[1:22:13] <+jake_protagonist> I miss the fixed cameras man I hope we get another one
[1:22:13] <%ClaudeMcGarren> its not
[1:22:16] <ohgodscorpions> came back in 4
[1:22:16] <%Guardiansaiyan> @AutechreTwinAphex I think
[1:22:22] <%Ranryu692> will you do Chris for REmake?
[1:22:26] <spoonbruh> Takes forever to go through doors though
[1:22:28] <FalseEyeD> Jill is EZ MODO
[1:22:30] <Froyuken> @botchdogg Holy crap, Ace Attorney did do that (at least the DS version of the first game).
[1:22:31] <AutechreTwinAphex> @Guardiansaiyan yeah I think you're right
[1:22:31] <SulfurousAcid> mansion Key
[1:22:32] <OlavOlavsson> i think in remake you can cycle the weapons in the preview
[1:22:34] <%genowyn> Bbbut the zapping system
[1:22:34] <spoonbruh> Takes up so much time
[1:22:42] <grimm_hatter> jill best girl
[1:22:44] <42nfl19> So does that mean Jill is the faster route for speed runners or something?
[1:22:47] <rufus2k2> Capcom should do demakes, or make the dead aim shit into proper REs
[1:22:48] <Froyuken> Interface is nearly the same.
[1:22:48] <%Birdigalore> What does Chris get in place of the lockpick?
[1:22:51] <rufus2k2> that'd be nuts
[1:22:53] <Supervyxen> Jill here's a sword key
[1:22:56] <%averyoddjew> did i miss jill sandwich?
[1:22:56] <$Remery_> but rebecca tho
[1:22:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> She's the master of unlocking BECAUSE she's a pianist. Something something master key
[1:22:59] <%Guardiansaiyan> @AngriestPat what is your speedrun record in this game?
[1:23:00] <hntronium> sword and shield
[1:23:01] <supportlesbian> muscles
[1:23:02] <cureneckbeard> did you drop your shield
[1:23:02] <rcand9> no zapping system yet kids
[1:23:04] <agadejobi> I don't know how you got Tank controls down so well, that was half the difficulty for me playing this game
[1:23:07] <%Laecerelius> Never save!
[1:23:09] <Supervyxen> Wait what? Why not pick up the ink ribbon?
[1:23:09] <%JJCheeker> I miss the painting of the duel
[1:23:11] <AutechreTwinAphex> what I dislike about RE1 Remake is the extra backtracking - having to waste an extra slot on the keroseen
[1:23:15] <%CappuccinoGuil> Today is a good day, lads
[1:23:15] <peachy996> lol "ink ribbon"
[1:23:17] <%Taisuru> NO DEATHS
[1:23:20] <BTRNDL> bawkLul
[1:23:20] <extradopeness> When’s Lisa Trevor
[1:23:22] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat does this have the zapping system or is that for RE2
[1:23:23] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Complete play-through tonight?
[1:23:23] <$insaneintentionsyo> bawkHm
[1:23:23] <AutechreTwinAphex> and some of the puzzles seem obtuse for no reason
[1:23:24] <officerodoherty> my favorite room!
[1:23:28] <majima666> i think if you're used to them the tank controls arent that bad
[1:23:30] <%blondie_ow> I used to be able to speedrun this game and get to hunters within 30 minutes, but that was like 6-7 years ago.
[1:23:30] <+Shadowpint> I can't remember the layout of 1
[1:23:31] <joylent_blue> the k n o w l e d g e
[1:23:32] <OlavOlavsson> @Birdigalore Chris needs to pick up one use small keys instead
[1:23:39] <+GeneralHysterics> The aughts is a great name, I just wanna say
[1:23:39] <FriendlyCheer> Good thing you saw this part in the demo
[1:23:40] <Graxe_> For speedrunning, I think you can skip the side room
[1:23:40] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat How long does it take to play these games as a total noob?
[1:23:41] <rytisone> hope it doesn't crash on this legit ps1
[1:23:41] <majima666> i mean i grew up with these games so im fine with them
[1:23:42] <SoySocks> why did they call it "zapping"?
[1:23:43] <+botchdogg> @extradopeness only in remake
[1:23:43] <dukenux> @AngriestPat did you play this or Remake more?
[1:23:46] <$insaneintentionsyo> bawkAy
[1:23:52] <+jake_protagonist> Did you watch that one RE speedrunner stream RE2 with Kamiya recently? Hearing hsi reason for intentionally picking the bad take of the DMC LIIIGHT line killed me
[1:23:52] <BTRNDL> bawkAYAYA
[1:23:53] <derap41> Well he's dead
[1:23:55] <BoneofMalkav> bawkAy
[1:24:02] <%Jekado> get rekt son
[1:24:03] <%blondie_ow> That was a waste of ammo since you could have ran by him haha
[1:24:03] <+C24U> Which scenario of RE1 is canon?
[1:24:07] <Graxe_> wooooooo
[1:24:08] <rcand9> re make is better in every way but you don't get the true voice acting.
[1:24:10] <%Zombino924> apatSmug_RD
[1:24:11] <$insaneintentionsyo> soup troop bawkHyper
[1:24:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> Quick! He's dark, Jill, shoot him!
[1:24:12] <Graxe_> Zombie noises
[1:24:14] <%Zombino924> neat
[1:24:17] <Mendin> So when is the Zapping System?
[1:24:17] <%JaydenSai> @AngriestPat Would this game work without auto-aim? Or would it just be WAY harder?
[1:24:19] <Cooksey89> Dose Clair have it easier in RE2 compared to Leon?
[1:24:23] <extradopeness> dang REmake really is the beast game of all time
[1:24:26] <Loarfy> fuck i keep thinking im getting a notification somewhere cuz of that sound
[1:24:30] <absdaddy> @jaydensai original release has no auto aim
[1:24:32] <majima666> i never completed the original re1. only remake
[1:24:34] <%MegboyManuel> wheres the dodge mechanic though, or is that 3?
[1:24:37] <+MrAtheGreat> Doesn't Jill start with a knife while Chris doesn't?
[1:24:40] <AutechreTwinAphex> I don't think everything in remake is better - having to burn all the zombies and wasting an extra two slots on a lighter and keroseen is a huge drag
[1:24:43] <@SSaryn> Dodge is in 3
[1:24:44] <TafferAA> dodge is 3
[1:24:44] <+Ilpala> there's also the blood puddle
[1:24:45] <%the_mental_punk> the auto aim is basically a snitch button to the camera angles
[1:24:45] <%JJCheeker> 3 has the Dodge mechanic
[1:24:46] <%Birdigalore> Aren't all zombies dead? Kappa
[1:24:47] <+Freelance7> Dodge mechanic is in 3
[1:24:48] <+dustingunn> and when they're offscreen
[1:24:48] <+junkyardpixel> aiming at enemies off screen
[1:24:48] <godzookylives> @C24U Technically both but it's a little confusing
[1:24:49] <residentfunko> @Loarfy i thought it was steam too it was freaking me the fuck out it's just the game
[1:24:50] <ngb1423> it just works
[1:24:53] <Admiral_Apathy> its so interesting to think about a time when "zombies" was a fresh exciting topic
[1:24:54] <Graxe_> Chris doesn't start with a gun
[1:24:56] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat Looks like the game is running great!
[1:24:59] <+boki_86> is there any real deifference between this and the HD Remake
[1:25:00] <%MegboyManuel> oh okay so Jill learned to dodge after the mansion
[1:25:01] <MSCanyon> so cheating essentially
[1:25:02] <deviljhojho_> thats dumb
[1:25:03] <rcand9> duh
[1:25:03] <%GarbageNirvana> Would you say RE1 is a solved game
[1:25:05] <Graxe_> He finds and takes Jills
[1:25:06] <%SvenHolgersson> w-wait
[1:25:07] <FirearmsInstructor> Itchy. Tasty.
[1:25:08] <+C24U> Explain the zombies that came out of graves in RE3 than
[1:25:08] <zedravan> did you increase the internal resolution in your legit ps1 pat? Or do you not like that option?

[1:25:11] <%unclekulikov> What about resident evil film canon?

[1:30:10] <FalseEyeD> "You can tell because of the blood."
[1:30:10] <Froyuken> No crimson heads here.
[1:30:11] <deviljhojho_> They are just chilling
[1:30:11] <Torivore> Them zambambos got WIDE chests
[1:30:11] <spoonbruh> Wait for that blood pool
[1:30:12] <PsychoFlash1> @spoonbruh remake explains why, spencer didn't want people getting into the lab so he hired a guy to make a bunch of puzzles and them killed him and his family
[1:30:13] <%ClaudeMcGarren> the weakest zombie noise ever LUL
[1:30:13] <Fujiwara_92> uhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[1:30:13] <%13ry4n93> 13ry4n93 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 4 month streak! Can we talk about the noise the zombies make as they get shot?

[1:30:23] <%Alazull> god damn how was this scary?
[1:30:24] <%Shady_Squid> i actually feel bad for them.
[1:30:24] <PhiZeroOne> I recall RE1 being unusually easy?

[1:30:33] <%blaggablag> 10 hours RE1 zombie lullaby
[1:30:34] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat FunFact: "Barry Burton" is voiced by Greg Smith, a retired school principal.
[1:30:34] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> I liked RE back when it was a haunted house adventure game.
[1:30:34] <officerodoherty> @Shady_Squid its bc they want a hug but jill won't give them one :/

[1:38:28] <+ar4ndomblackguy> atpSuspect
[1:38:29] <Jtf374> when will you do League streams?
[1:38:29] <%IMDRanged> @AngriestPat Which version of RE is this? Is this the one with the Clowns Farting in the Basement music one?
[1:38:31] <Torivore> Can you mix Gerbs with Yerbs or Rebs, or was that added in later games?
[1:38:38] <zafooru> there were earlier games than 1?
[1:38:38] <homurau> i can't wait to see nemesis-kun in april.
[1:38:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> that explains it @ar4ndomblackguy
[1:38:42] <DashXero> Wasn't the clown fart composer pretending to be deaf or some shit?
[1:38:43] <allanmiri> Feels weird to not have to worry about burning the zombos
[1:38:44] <Froyuken> This music gave me so many chills in 96.
[1:38:45] <+el_thag> Composer guy was a Giant Fraud!
[1:38:45] <%13ry4n93> how many versions of RE1 are there?
[1:38:47] <derekwst3> apatRaffle

[1:39:09] <rcand9> the ds remake was pretty good too
[1:39:13] <majima666> if resident evil taught me one thing its that everything is FINE as long as you have your green herb
[1:39:14] <%Jekado> weird blue herb that exsist only in the arclavie mountains
[1:39:15] <+IrishWeegee> @Torivore yellow was added in 4 to make your hp bar bigger
[1:39:15] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> vineAlien
[1:39:15] <scottishwolf> I totally forgot that the herbs were why umbrella did all this shit

[1:39:33] <Higaraishi> do these herbs acctually get names in any game?
[1:39:33] <+C24U> Wasn't the clown fart song actually shown that at certain melody's or instrument's it actually sounds good and creepy?
[1:39:34] <+WarbossMetal> it can put body parts back together and make them work using magic, we know
[1:39:38] <Graxe_> Three red herbs, let's go
[1:39:43] <Froyuken> Oh wait, 5. I forgot the DS game.

[1:47:03] <%Kataguro> Where she's a stripper cop

[1:47:04] <%Vikken141> Remake is better imo
[1:47:05] <Afroperonista> Kappa
[1:47:05] <Rotabrutsama> @AngriestPat in the DS version you can touch jills butt and she reacts
[1:47:05] <+dustingunn> the DS version's knifing minigame fucking sucks though
[1:47:05] <majima666> not all the remixed songs are stinkers
[1:47:05] <rytisone> I wanna make sweet sweet love to this music
[1:47:05] <hlreiku> Whaddabout the GBC version?

[1:47:09] <BTRNDL> the DS version VA is so incredibly worse than this one bawkLul
[1:47:09] <peachy996> Now this aged beautifully
[1:47:11] <%JaydenSai> @AngriestPat Didnt Deadly Silence have a First Person mode?
[1:47:11] <%Jekado> i love how a lot of DS games do that
[1:47:11] <+C24U> RE2 Custom Shotgun had the best gun sound effect ever
[1:47:12] <%13ry4n93> It's like the Bioshock port to the Wii
[1:47:13] <joylent_blue> ForneusAtSeaWorld have a safe flight!
[1:47:17] <absdaddy> @cerabret100 a zombie right next to you as you open the door with almost no time to react
[1:47:17] <+IrishWeegee> Nintendo has the best version, yet again rooEZ
[1:47:17] <spoonbruh> Fighting yawn with a knife 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
[1:47:18] <rcand9> remake is easily the best

[1:56:45] <%SoFarFetched> @Chryses_ are you talking remake between RE1 and RE1 Remake? There's quite a few differences with new stuff
[1:56:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> Elmo Orb
[1:56:50] <Rotabrutsama> ew
[1:56:52] <Milo_Oda> is this the version with the hilarious basement theme?
[1:56:54] <%Guardiansaiyan> ...why are you looking at ELMO's dick pat?
[1:56:54] <ZeeJiggle> Girthy boi
[1:56:55] <$RetroCop87> sell it to the merchant
[1:56:55] <$Remery_> I knew it!!!!
[1:56:55] <%comfyman12> comfyman12 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Listening to last podcast and boy you're gonna be really crazy excited for the new star wars since it's exactly what you wanted.
[1:56:56] <%legendscar01> Rich Bitch
[1:56:56] <deltakuma009> which re has the best save room music?
[1:56:59] <%Birdigalore> Does Elmo inflate with saline?
[1:57:01] <rytisone> get paid, get laid
[1:57:03] <+necrocannibal2> @deltakuma009 2
[1:57:04] <RubberFistFight> @Sphincter_Spelunker there's plenty of animals that are poisonous, not venomous. Poison dart frog is a good example - they produce some pretty awful toxins in their bodies that get exuded through their skin. You touch em, it's game over.
[1:57:07] <+richuyo> The chaos emerald
[1:57:08] <$Remery_> I knew they were just giving it handjobs
[1:57:11] <MattDemers> Is Jill's portrait different in the PAL version? Like her menu icon is a white woman
[1:57:14] <+cjl1991> cats are the best
[1:57:16] <Jane_Lo> @deltakuma009 re3
[1:57:18] <Froyuken> RE1 remake can be considered a different game with all the changes and additions.
[1:57:23] <%Dutchpotato> That’s just a chaos emerald
[1:57:28] <zafooru> it was the style at the time
[1:57:28] <%Ranryu692> so everyone who has ever had wallpaper?
[1:57:32] <SomersaultJustice> this mansion sure is a sweet home
[1:57:35] <%Kataguro> Maybe it is
[1:57:36] <mirfosevik> Anyone else find the quick turnaround between announcement and release of RE3make kinda odd? It was almost four years between the announcement of RE2make and its release
[1:57:36] <+NickLeeVee> The poor taste in wallpaper is the true horror.
[1:57:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> this one does
[1:57:38] <%Birdigalore> This tiger is an anime protagonist!
[1:57:39] <+PA_Raiden333> but... What a mansion
[1:57:39] <+necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat what's your favorite save room theme?
[1:57:40] <+Dr_Mooose> cool tigers do
[1:57:41] <lotharrio> Most tigers are deviant art OCs.
[1:57:41] <officerodoherty> wasnt the mansion made in like the early 50s?
[1:57:42] <%replicantj49gr> but great taste in human flesh ;)
[1:57:43] <%honeyman18> We need more hallucinogen secreting animals.
[1:57:43] <%SvenHolgersson> Like the game would lie about something Pat
[1:57:44] <13ry4n93> I feel like that's not even really a puzzle
[1:57:46] <+el_thag> Doesn’t Barry saving Jill affect a note later on?
[1:57:46] <anAngryHamster> Well maybe one did
[1:57:46] <%SvenHolgersson> SCOFF
[1:57:48] <officerodoherty> like, lore-wise
[1:57:48] <$RetroCop87> "some tigers have fucking DIAMONDS for eyes"
[1:57:50] <+Punchasaur> its the 90s so yeah
[1:57:52] <TonberryCrunch> tigers can have a little heterochromia
[1:57:54] <FriendlyCheer> WIND!
[1:57:54] <ZeeJiggle> What, you gonna argue with a statue?
[1:57:54] <CoffeeSlice> OOF plaque
[1:57:55] <Supervyxen> If I ever strike it rich I'm gonna build the Spencer Estate as my new house.
[1:57:56] <zettig> Thanks for the HahaHide @comfyman12
[1:57:57] <+stooooo22> stooooo22 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months! 
[1:57:58] <%Jaxnos> the mansion was built to the trendiest of specifications, i'll have you know SIR
[1:57:58] <+ahdurian> have you ever seen a real tiger pat? ya right
[1:58:00] <%mh9s> have you met every tiger?
[1:58:01] <%Takreth> It could be an anime tiger
[1:58:01] <$thatoneicebear> It was the late 80s/early90s, just be glad there's no popcorn ceilings @ Pat
[1:58:02] <Froyuken> @necrocannibal2 I like the CVX save room theme.
[1:58:05] <Milo_Oda> can tigers not get heterochromia?
[1:58:05] <valriot> @angriestpat Yes, the wallpaper. Not the ceiling that lowers and crushes you with unnecessary spikes
[1:58:12] <rytisone> anime heterochromia tigers
[1:58:12] <+necrocannibal2> @Froyuken that one is great too
[1:58:13] <+el_thag> How dare you Pat! Spencer has impeccable taste
[1:58:16] <+Punchasaur> SANS UNDERTIGER
[1:58:18] <$0ddeye> Thanks for the HahaHide @stooooo22
[1:58:18] <Bagelborn> @zettig is that freaking homie
[1:58:20] <+necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat your favorite save room theme?
[1:58:20] <extradopeness> You don’t know!
[1:58:20] <+paladinstarbuster> TIGERS CAN HAVE HETEROCHROMIA THO
[1:58:21] <%SvenHolgersson> Naruto Eye Jutsu Tiger
[1:58:23] <officerodoherty> @thatoneicebear we dont see the ceilings . . .for all we know there could be
[1:58:23] <%13ry4n93> So question, pat.
[1:58:24] <%ThatGuyfromMars> what doesn't drive you crazy, pat
[1:58:27] <lotharrio> Pat, tigers have a red eye, a blue eye, a dark miasma of power, hate religion, love blood, and think sports are lame.
[1:58:32] <+ahdurian> of course he does mind goblins
[1:58:32] <cureneckbeard> but what if you need them later
[1:58:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Yeah, I'm watching you

[1:58:47] <Storm_Samurai> @AngriestPat Several of the Resident Evil mansion's pre-rendered backdrops were inspired by The Overlook Hotel, the setting for the 1980 horror film, The Shining.
[1:58:47] <%bread_assassin> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[1:58:48] <rytisone> for all the damage you take

[1:59:19] <%Jekado> not sure which is worst
[1:59:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> eat all the health items as you encounter them, then you'll NEVER have to carry them
[1:59:21] <+necrocannibal2> time to /sip/
[1:59:21] <+kaiju7544> At what time does RE1 take place in relation to the others?
[1:59:22] <%Birdigalore> Tickle the beans!
[1:59:25] <%isolex_> I finally got 680 points. I need to be smart with what i spend it on. um...elmo is cute. Shake his bag
[1:59:27] <$Tuskor13> If you have to ask your audience if you're stupid you're seriously out of touch with us, we are a hivemind with a combined IQ of 37
[1:59:27] <+GeneralHysterics> no one

[1:59:41] <%Taisuru> Pat Stares At Resident Evil 1 and Pets Elmo
[1:59:42] <hlreiku> not me
[1:59:49] <+C24U> Several rooms of hunters?
[1:59:49] <DCGR10G> a boss
[1:59:49] <rytisone> big bees
[1:59:49] <Supervyxen> I don't watch Pat stream often but when he's playing a game he knows front to back it's super entertaining.
[1:59:52] <+el_thag> RE1 is after RE0 few months before RE2 whoever asked!
[1:59:53] <+ahdurian> but what if
[1:59:54] <tripessolides> you don't remember re3 huh
[1:59:55] <+KNYGHT87> 📝
[1:59:55] <waifoong98> carry no weapons, just carry ammo Kappa
[1:59:57] <lotharrio> It's becuase of his goblins that he likes it rcand9
[1:59:57] <+magusdraco> 4 lickers
[1:59:59] <theredfox930000> I never thought about that
[2:00:00] <%dekkitout> Everything else, ofc tajC
[2:00:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> Drink the shotgun
[2:00:08] <Froyuken> Like flame rounds!
[2:00:09] <%Jekado> heat the shotgun
[2:00:10] <%Birdigalore> Heat the shotgun
[2:00:12] <DrkJP520> Does this game colour the rooms on the map so you know which ones you're done with? Can't remember
[2:00:13] <%Birdigalore> DAMMIT
[2:00:15] <%Jekado> cool the shotgun
[2:00:15] <$zero_g_toad> YOU KNOW WHAT'S A REAL GOD DAMN WASTE TIME!? WATCHING YOUR STREAM, LATER!
[2:00:16] <warmnoid> i was going to say headshot zombos but i forgot crimson heads aren't in the original
[2:00:17] <graemecrackers1> zoneMash
[2:00:18] <Fujiwara_92> carry nothing that way you have even more room Kappa
[2:00:19] <%Jekado> hahaha
[2:00:20] <+necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat favorite save room theme?
[2:00:26] <kingbaconcrispy> Well if you're only carrying the shotgun or grenade launcher do carry ammo.
[2:00:27] <%Chryses_> When does Chris hook his boulder wife in this game?
[2:00:27] <%XzileGaming> Insanity Shotgun
[2:00:32] <majima666> i killed most things i came across in re2 remake
[2:00:33] <+necrocannibal2> correct answer
[2:00:34] <%Jekado> @Birdigalore LUL
[2:00:34] <+Shadowpint> RE3's is the best
[2:00:35] <%comfyman12> You can avoid the last 2 lickers if you hug the wall
[2:00:36] <%Erimos> dip the shotgun in acid to get the acid shotgun
[2:00:39] <%Nina96> 2 easy
[2:00:40] <rytisone> you don't HAVE to fight them
[2:00:41] <zafooru> ombinus
[2:00:41] <flyingtentaclemonster> but what if Im bad and I miss every shot though?
[2:00:41] <%blondie_ow> My favorite save room theme is CV
[2:00:41] <VariousOminousDrones> Sure is
[2:00:41] <MSCanyon> remake for me
[2:00:42] <+magusdraco> @angriestpat eh you can skip those two too if you run past them and reset 'em by going a bit of the ways to the stairwell or something
[2:00:42] <Taberner1604> big agree
[2:00:44] <RubberFistFight> OMBANOUS
[2:00:44] <Fujiwara_92> RE2 easy
[2:00:44] <%isolex_> @necrocannibal2 Implying that the answer is anything other than 2's save theme
[2:00:45] <happyfunt1me> 2 deff and 7 is good.
[2:00:46] <majima666> being chased through the station by zombies, lickers and mr x is not fun
[2:00:47] <%SvenHolgersson> Omnibus
[2:00:47] <outis94> clown shoes in basement?
[2:00:47] <$Sir_stride> 4s is p good
[2:00:48] <+houseofnonsense> 1's still my favorite
[2:00:48] <%Jekado> INSANITY SHOTGUN
[2:00:49] <%kyh9> President just got impeached by the way
[2:00:51] <+kikilalaa> 3s is so good
[2:00:54] <+St33l_Titan> 2 was always going to be the correct answer
[2:00:55] <DrkJP520> RE4 music tho
[2:00:56] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> RE7 isa good to sleep to
[2:00:57] <Strider222> Sometimes, I dream about cheese.
[2:00:57] <VariousOminousDrones> Ominous?!
[2:00:58] <Fujiwara_92> 4 is good yeah
[2:00:59] <+Shadowpint> 3's save theme >>>>>> 2's
[2:01:01] <cureneckbeard> Is there ever a Resident Evil game where the player's trust in the save room is betrayed?
[2:01:01] <+TungstenViper> code veronica is the best
[2:01:02] <+GeneralHysterics> what is this, death stranding?
[2:01:13] <dukenux> I miss Barry
[2:01:14] <RubberFistFight> @kyh9 can't wait for the senate to do absolutely nothing with that outcome.
[2:01:16] <iWBstovetop> Which is the hardest RE game for you, Pat?
[2:01:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Strider222 what kinda cheese. better not be no basic ass cheddar
[2:01:20] <$AtomicExperience> @AngriestPat Are you ever gonna test out the Stadia one day just to see how bad it is?
[2:01:22] <ManfredA> @cureneckbeard RE2
[2:01:25] <Froyuken> @cureneckbeard Don't think so.
[2:01:26] <%arsonistdaria> "don't carry ammo" "I NEED ALL THIS HEALING FOR THIS GAME THAT I SOLVED"
[2:01:27] <majima666> i think they flirt with the save room in re3
[2:01:27] <%Jekado> yeah that nuts here watching some canadian playing a spook game why my country is exploding
[2:01:31] <+ahdurian> let us see the dogs

[2:01:48] <tripessolides> no it's here too

[2:01:54] <+St33l_Titan> @cureneckbeard yes, RE2Make police station lobby after you activate Mr X betchFINE
[2:01:55] <Supervyxen> Hey @AngriestPat, did you ever play REmake 2 on Hardcore? I did for ink ribbon saving and it was fucking rough. Ran out of ammo fighting the first boss and had to use the knife.
[2:01:56] <+TungstenViper> @cureneckbeard no, Nd I'm still waiting for the game that does it. maybe RE3?
[2:01:59] <+el_thag> Try the front door!

[2:02:10] <+Amperture> PAT PASSED UP A GREEN HERB
[2:02:12] <+Shadowpint> RE games aren't long, especially if you know what you're doing
[2:02:12] <%SoFarFetched> @Higaraishi like possibly 7 hours ish depending if you know where to go?
[2:02:13] <Froyuken> @Higaraishi 2 hours if you know what you're doing.
[2:02:14] <Hellarussian> thats just fucking crazy
[2:02:17] <Strider222> @Sphincter_Spelunker Gouda
[2:02:18] <extradopeness> I don’t believe the lies
[2:02:18] <%lethallunacyx> pretty sure dogs come in
[2:02:19] <$Dakuu75> damn it, I been playing MHW all day. i don't think i've drunk ANY water in 24 hours

[2:02:34] <extradopeness> Get them keys out
[2:02:34] <+the_vedo_show> some RE hggShaq
[2:02:38] <%Chryses_> Are any side games canon? Revelations 1 or 2 for instance? HahaDreidel
[2:02:39] <graemecrackers1> Is Paige there?
[2:02:41] <+skyheys> Why can't keys disintegrate on use like in real life
[2:02:41] <+MrAtheGreat> Speaking of doors how about that Door in RE2 that spawned three zombos?
[2:02:42] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> etalPsycho
[2:02:43] <+zabemareu> you get the cutscene of the dog getting crushed in the door
[2:02:43] <Froyuken> Herbs should stack.
[2:02:47] <tripessolides> yes @Chryses_
[2:02:47] <%AgniBrandt> Don't you remember the experiment?
[2:02:56] <rcand9> pat need the herbs to never use them guys
[2:03:03] <Bagelborn> why do I keep thinking the menu noises are dicord
[2:03:03] <duskrush> there goes the speedrun world record
[2:03:07] <+trekkie11041> @Chryses_ they are for sure
[2:03:07] <kingbaconcrispy> I like how to puzzle tells you where to place the emblems but it doesn't matter.
[2:03:16] <+MrAtheGreat> To be fair you are cutting through this game.
[2:03:18] <ManfredA> @Chryses_ afaik except for certain games most are canon, even outbreak
[2:03:19] <+skyheys> I heard this was a zombie game why is this lady running around an empty house
[2:03:23] <disister1201> Dogs totally come through the front in og re1
[2:03:24] <%Erimos> @Chryses_ Outbreak is at least somewhat canon considering the note by the reporter in RE7
[2:03:26] <%Jekado> gotta save all those mega heal alls for the end game credit scene
[2:03:27] <Higaraishi> @SoFarFetched dang, a friend of mine recommended me to play old RE games and i was thinking about it, but Pat took that bullet for me apparently
[2:03:31] <risenlp2> @AngriestPat describing my anxiety problems to my therapist as 'mind goblins' got them to change my medication.. so thanks? maybe?
[2:03:32] <tripessolides> RE7 confirmed that outbreak is canon
[2:03:36] <+necrocannibal2> man, Outbreak was great
[2:03:45] <%XzileGaming> stroke.
[2:03:46] <$milhousego> @angriestpat how hyped would you be for a Remake of RE 1, similar to 2 and the upcoming 3?
[2:03:47] <$AtomicExperience> Inventory Management is the name of the game
[2:03:48] <+WhiskeyInTheJamJar> Oh shit, I’m glad I could catch the first one!
[2:03:48] <ManfredA> @Erimos RE2make references it too
[2:03:49] <%arsonistdaria> @AngriestPat You ever play RE1 and think about how it resulted in DMC5
[2:03:50] <zepelinnn1> MY LIFER IS SHIT
[2:03:50] <Supervyxen> fucking plant 42
[2:03:54] <+el_thag> Outbreak remaster when Capcom?
[2:03:55] <majima666> i played a little of outbreak 2 offline. all i remember is a zombie elephant lol
[2:03:56] <%SoFarFetched> @Higaraishi It's good,it depends if you want to do remakes and/or play the originals. It's pretty straight forward I'd say for some puzzles.
[2:03:58] <+TungstenViper> @tripessolides RE2 remake confirmed it too
[2:04:00] <+GeneralHysterics> For a long time I didn't really appreciate sandwiches. But holy shit, they put in work.
[2:04:01] <+ahdurian> half of them
[2:04:02] <PsychoFlash1> @milhousego not pat but i'd be hyped as fuck
[2:04:03] <%Jekado> Pat is taking the bullet for me by playing LoL because now i don't have to play it
[2:04:04] <extradopeness> Is outbreak the one with the zombie elephant

[2:14:49] <+jake_protagonist> @hyperbomb21 that’s remake not RE1 Classic I think
[2:14:50] <@StridentSong> Channel Points are awarded every couple minutes for watching a stream. Every ~5 minutes, a envelope will appear next to your points that you can click for bonus points. You also get extra points for watching multiple streams in a row. They allow you to: Unlock a sub emote for 24 hours, Highlight a message in chat, or modify one of the existing sub emotes for 24 hours (example below). Pat can alternative add other custom options if he chooses as well.
[2:14:51] <Graxe_> Yeah, this one holds only 6
[2:14:52] <%Validuntil2077> aww no infinite capacity
[2:14:52] <kurejichi> Rope doesn't matter I think for the classic. It's in the sewers you can get him killed when he goes ahead

[2:16:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> poison snake bite
[2:16:13] <+Freelance7> IT'S POISONOUS

[2:16:18] <Tracazoid> It's just a flesh wound

[2:16:24] <%13ry4n93> this shit is bananas
[2:16:25] <@ShockzNDrawe> can't remember, can you even save richard in this version or was that added to REmake
[2:16:26] <corepercentlives> huge
[2:16:27] <kingbaconcrispy> This cutscene is also one of the sillier ones.
[2:16:27] <%LiquidShake83> snakes in space
[2:16:30] <tripessolides> Hey it's the best puzzle
[2:16:31] <%CappuccinoGuil> @dickbuttwoman It's VENOMOUS
[2:16:32] <$StarlitStunner> Richard Aiken is very strong
[2:16:32] <%LiquidShake83> morty
[2:16:32] <%13ry4n93> b a n a n a s
[2:16:35] <stabbityrabbit> @SoFarFetched But Capcom has a history of keeping hold of IPs they have no interest in using. It seems like people are just setting themselves up for disappointment.
[2:16:40] <+blademaster247> GIVE UP
[2:16:40] <waifoong98> the snake inject Monster instead of poison? Kappa
[2:16:44] <Froyuken> Boy is it.
[2:16:44] <$draugrix> @residentfan1 after gun survivor 100% no death speedrun
[2:16:44] <tripessolides> it's the worst in the remake
[2:16:45] <Fujiwara_92> it's actually venomous, poison you eat, venom you contract
[2:16:46] <@commanderclaw> Fuck this puzzle in the remake
[2:16:50] <+dheng1> It’s abnormally large
[2:16:52] <%blaggablag> it's impuzzlebleee
[2:16:54] <Milo_Oda> "puzzles" Kappa
[2:16:59] <@ShockzNDrawe> I THINK this puzzle is just trial and error in REmake
[2:17:02] <+xBolts4Lifex> puzzle good
[2:17:03] <+MurlinDurl> poozlay
[2:17:05] <+xBolts4Lifex> god*
[2:17:06] <Dhurkst> They're doing their best!
[2:17:06] <officerodoherty> i love the little dust particles texture
[2:17:07] <@ShockzNDrawe> because for as many times as I've played it
[2:17:11] <%13ry4n93> what even
[2:17:12] <+Ilpala> if you push the statue off now do you just die?
[2:17:12] <$thatoneicebear> angery sun
[2:17:12] <%Laecerelius> ANGRY SUN
[2:17:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @CappuccinoGuil nah, they clearly absorb the poison from around the bite wound Kappa
[2:17:14] <+nictron90> That looks kinda like the angry sun from Mario
[2:17:14] <tripessolides> I always do it randomly in the remake
[2:17:16] <@ShockzNDrawe> I have never once figure out any hints or clues
[2:17:18] <Tracazoid> The only puzzle worse in the REmake IMO is the strain glass puzzle/age puzzle.
[2:17:22] <Neo_Kaiser> lol just cover the gas holes.
[2:17:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> Remember kids, if it sounds like a snake, IT'S A MISTAAKE
[2:17:27] <+Rivet95> how did u solve that so quick it was so complicated
[2:17:29] <%Jekado> its the angry sun from mario 3?
[2:17:31] <godzookylives> It's the sun From Super Mario Bros. 3
[2:17:34] <+joekuta71> Even Paige could solve these puzzles?
[2:17:47] <%13ry4n93> @joekuta71 let's not be hasty here
[2:17:48] <%Jekado> BUT BABA
[2:17:48] <PsychoFlash1> @ShockzNDrawe the only puzzles I absolutely had to use a walkthrough were this and the paintings one in remake
[2:17:50] <%SoFarFetched> @stabbityrabbit yeah it's why some people aren't getting excited because it could be they are just having it,and not make anything out of it. Or worse they take those and turn them into mobile games LUL
[2:17:54] <KellBeII> that must be a really well chiseled floor for it to block the vents like that
[2:17:57] <$draugrix> @joekuta71 well they aren't shadow.puzzles so
[2:18:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> In our hearts <#
[2:18:03] <marvel877> MEMORY AT RISK
[2:18:06] <+MurlinDurl> i could never remember what door is what so id run around trying all of them
[2:18:08] <+necrocannibal2> @AngriestPat when will Paige play RE1? Kappa
[2:18:10] <@ShockzNDrawe> paintings felt easy to me since they just tell you what you have to do
[2:18:12] <%Jaxnos> find the doors, save the world
[2:18:14] <%Jekado> wow they do give you a lot of healing
[2:18:15] <Fujiwara_92> in your mind palace?
[2:18:16] <kingbaconcrispy> Terrible demons
[2:18:17] <+Shadowpint> I was afraid that puzzle would kill me in REmake so I used a guide
[2:18:18] <Snektor> Hey pat what are you playing this on, a pc?
[2:18:23] <%SvenHolgersson> Did Paige ever pick Baba is You back up?

[2:19:46] <+MurlinDurl> he's gonna be fine SeemsGood
[2:19:46] <Higaraishi> heve you ever seen a snake pat?
[2:19:47] <%honeyman18> Get a Phoenix
[2:19:47] <+necrocannibal2> he just needs to rest a bit
[2:19:48] <+el_thag> It’s a giant mutant snake pat...
[2:19:49] <darcfowler1995> actually there are some species of snake that have fangs and teeth
[2:19:49] <bluebiscuit94> Naturally, as you do.
[2:19:50] <+MrAtheGreat> He’s actually kinda tough
[2:19:50] <Froyuken> It's a biologically advanced snake. Who's to say it wouldn't have more teeth?
[2:19:51] <Higaraishi> they big
[2:19:51] <%starotter70> Shhhhhh
[2:19:53] <Higaraishi> sometimes
[2:19:53] <3Xgilly> what about a primordial serpent
[2:19:54] <%Teintstein> but but shut up
[2:19:54] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat, Snakes venom cauterizes wounds.
[2:19:55] <YourFalloutCompanion> Remember Kevin in Outbreak goes OW from getting bit
[2:19:55] <SpellCatty> but what if the snake had a gun, a gun that shot coke cans. poison coke cans
[2:19:55] <Snektor> WELL YEAH NOT THIS ONE BUT NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE 2 YOU DWARF
[2:19:55] <%Jekado> multiple bites i think
[2:19:57] <ANGRYHAWK178> so he was bit five times
[2:19:57] <DrkJP520> it looks like he was gunned down lol
[2:19:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> Okay, but think about it: Either the snake has anger issues and bit him 5-10 times, or the snake has MULTIPLE FANGS. Fucking metal.

[2:31:55] <stabbityrabbit> I'm glad to find out that RE has always had stupid action-movie bullshit. Here I thought it was added in later games.
[2:31:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> you're actually doing Code Veronica?
[2:31:58] <%13ry4n93> would you recommend playing the original game and then the remake, pat?
[2:31:59] <peachy996> What about Gun Survivor and ORC
[2:32:00] <$RetroCop87> When's the part when Wesker summons the heartless and unlocks the keyhole

[2:32:51] <kurejichi> Gaiden!!!
[2:32:55] <+Rivet95> He sees all of our questions. He just ignores most of them.
[2:32:56] <@ShockzNDrawe> This game has aged better and worse than I thought
[2:32:57] <Snektor> @WarbossMetal Thank god someone besides me wants one
[2:32:58] <therealtacopancakes> you're playing

[2:33:04] <+trekkie11041> @rerun131 my bad its april 3
[2:33:06] <garbageheaphound> Hey Pat are you going to do the Chris campaign in this?
[2:33:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 6 will take longer than Paige's Dark Souls 2 run
[2:33:09] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat should become an RE speed streamer
[2:33:10] <+MurlinDurl> speedruns on REmake2 are fun to watch
[2:33:13] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat is the item box infinite?
[2:33:14] <Bagelborn> @ShockzNDrawe better in what ways?
[2:33:15] <iWBstovetop> RE2 any% WR inc?

[2:33:40] <%Ranryu692> because video game contrivances
[2:33:41] <countgaculatv> Question, why the fuck does RE0 not have item box technology?
[2:33:41] <%Nina96> magic
[2:33:42] <Neo_Kaiser> Fun fact, the base game didn't share item boxes.
[2:33:42] <+Rivet95> The mansion is a series of elaborate conveyor belts behind the walls
[2:33:43] <+cjl1991> I wish I had a magic box
[2:33:44] <DrkJP520> What's your speedrun time on Umbrella Chronicles?
[2:33:45] <lionandfox21> Item box tech would literally revolutionize the world if it were real lol
[2:33:48] <%Gogogolem> Teleporting Items, fuck yeah
[2:33:48] <+WutangchickeN> carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED carciBLOCKED
[2:33:48] <Froyuken> Play beta mode in REmake where all item boxes aren't shared.
[2:33:50] <%Jekado> @AngriestPat Do you think you can beat your RE2 best friends Lets play time when you play.
[2:33:54] <%SoFarFetched> WITH PAIGE
[2:33:54] <+berserker_103> I'd buy a subscription for one
[2:33:54] <%blondie_ow> Unless you play real survival in RE1 remake
[2:33:55] <%13ry4n93> you'd think umbrella'd just sell the teleportation tech
[2:34:02] <CheshireP> Burn
[2:34:02] <%Chichen> Play with Paige im sure thatll go well
[2:34:02] <Ianrazz> Man the remake of one is so fucking good, i didn't like the original that much
[2:34:03] <%SvenHolgersson> FUCKED UP
[2:34:03] <+GeneralHysterics> should play revelations with paige
[2:34:04] <owo_uwu_owo_my_dude> @angriestpat so like the postal box from New Vegas except infinitely more useful?
[2:34:04] <@commanderclaw> Fuggins cannot be controlled
[2:34:04] <dukenux> SHEVA
[2:34:05] <lionandfox21> SHEVA IS COOL
[2:34:06] <dukenux> HURRY

[2:34:14] <%D00msDayDan> pat is a lefty confirmed

[2:34:18] <+Shadowpint> Did they fix her AI
[2:34:18] <xxmagonx> Are the boxes just the stands for RE protags?
[2:34:20] <+MurlinDurl> criz....oroboros criz.....
[2:34:21] <+RedKazoo> Sheva Hot
[2:34:22] <%Ranryu692> Paige needs to be your co-op partner in Revelations 2
[2:34:23] <%BayowolfTerra> Its how the tyrants keep gettin ahead of ya
[2:34:23] <@ShockzNDrawe> Fuggins would steal the spotlight anyways cuz he's too cool
[2:34:24] <Neo_Kaiser> You can solo play as Sheva in RE5 Pat
[2:34:24] <+MachigattaLT> LEON MY SISTER
[2:34:25] <lotharrio> The idea that you aren't going to play RE5 with Paige is sad.
[2:34:28] <%Ranryu692> so she can point items out for you
[2:34:28] <%13ry4n93> IT IS REGRETFUL THAT WE WILL NEVER SEE SHEVA AGAIN
[2:34:29] <RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat my headcanon is that the entirety of racoon city has a underground sorting center full of robots, and the "bottoms" of all the boxes are actually hinged and feed into/out of said giant robot sorting center. That's Umbrella's TRUE achievement - all the bioweapons is just a garnish on top.
[2:34:29] <Trabnaxes> If the Item box is so great, how come Umbrella didn't use it to get the G Virus out of Raccoon city?
[2:34:30] <+Jolnir> CMON CMON CMON
[2:34:30] <+ratreborn> RE5 is best played co-op, singelplayer shouldnt even be allowed

[2:34:36] <DrkJP520> Sheva I'm coming
[2:34:38] <+Shadowpint> Cuz the AI put me off getting 5 cuz I have nobody to play with
[2:34:38] <%Erimos> Schrodinger's box. The items are simultaneously in the box and every other box. It makes total sense, really.
[2:34:38] <+Order_of_Mystery> Sheva is a leftie, and therefore better
[2:34:40] <owo_uwu_owo_my_dude> wait sheva is a lefty? finally another one found
[2:34:40] <homurau> i've finished packing, chat! HandsUp
[2:34:41] <%starotter70> Has Sheeva appeared since?
[2:34:42] <Monkroot> I love that we have JILL PLEASE now too
[2:34:43] <Froyuken> What's in the room with the busted doorknob in this game?
[2:34:44] <42nfl19> is there any person who you would want to coop with? @angriestpat
[2:34:45] <+WarbossMetal> thank god that doornob thing isnt there
[2:34:45] <$Blackgaver> donk donk donk donk
[2:34:46] <%Guardiansaiyan> Will you play Deadly Premonition 2 on stream when it comes out next year?
[2:34:46] <stabbityrabbit> @el_thag I was just talking about that earlier. The fact that Darkstalkers is also updated makes me think nothing is coming. Would love to be wrong though.
[2:34:47] <$StarlitStunner> Fuggins are known for being difficult to control
[2:34:59] <scrashman> tbf they already did an LP of RE5 co-op
[2:35:00] <@ShockzNDrawe> well she HAS
[2:35:02] <%starotter70> Shame
[2:35:03] <+spodebroker> She isn't even RE Mercenaries, which SUCKS
[2:35:04] <$8BitDsx> I couldn't finish re5 solo because the ai was too bad. my friend and I ended up playing locally and getting the platinum after 2 days. fun times
[2:35:05] <Pallid_Ranger> I remember beating that game with my buddy and at the NG+ or whatever he got a fuck-mothering minigun and I had a damn bow. I was so angry lol
[2:35:07] <officerodoherty> @owo_uwu_owo_my_dude im a lefty! theres clear art in DMC3 of vergil playing bass left-handed also!
[2:35:07] <%Validuntil2077> what about my boy josh???
[2:35:07] <@ShockzNDrawe> but only in the cgi films
[2:35:08] <%Guardiansaiyan> yeyeyeyeyeye
[2:35:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> In apatCrazyhead_SG
[2:35:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> She does nothing. She's just there
[2:35:10] <%13ry4n93> I'm a sucker for any accent that's not a generic american accent
[2:35:10] <goddamndavid> she should have been in been in RE6
[2:35:11] <+RowenCleric> I need a HEEEERRRB
[2:35:11] <TonberryCrunch> "Does Wesker even know her name" LUL
[2:35:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> being hot
[2:35:16] <$thatoneicebear> Is this the version of RE that has the clown fart basement music?
[2:35:17] <%SvenHolgersson> So shes the Lucia of RE?
[2:35:17] <%Birdigalore> yPOU CAN SEE ALL THE sHEVA YOU WANT ON pORNHUB
[2:35:21] <Neo_Kaiser> When is Pat going to stream Galarians?
[2:35:21] <+Shadowpint> I like Sheva but don't get her accent
[2:35:23] <%BayowolfTerra> Lotta 1 n done protags in re
[2:35:23] <$Blackgaver> diablo 4 on stream? in 2024? KEKW
[2:35:25] <Pallid_Ranger> The bow sucked
[2:35:30] <XelGel> :)
[2:35:30] <+spodebroker> cuz they use all the other RE5 assets, and without her there to balance it out, the unintentional(?) racism becomes uncomfortable
[2:35:30] <HyperBomb21> Because Deadly Premonition kinda sucks tbh. you may as well just watch the cutscenes on youtube
[2:35:30] <peachy996> Sheeva > Sheva
[2:35:31] <tigerfang86> awww
[2:35:33] <%Validuntil2077> god damnit

[2:35:41] <%Birdigalore> Sheva is big on Pornhub
[2:35:44] <%13ry4n93> you gonna play that new half life game pat
[2:35:45] <Fujiwara_92> Friendly reminder: Wesker indeed does not know Sheva's name
[2:35:47] <%Validuntil2077> @Shadowpint colonialism
[2:35:48] <+el_thag> @stabbityrabbit Probably shouldn’t get any hopes up but ya never know...
[2:35:51] <DHB05> is this director's cut or vanilla
[2:35:53] <%legendscar01> Jill must be blind as fuck
[2:35:57] <Supervyxen> director's cut
[2:35:59] <haisho> sadly it's vanilla
[2:36:00] <iWBstovetop> Are you mentally prepared to play through RE6?
[2:36:02] <+Ilpala> They're really powerful, especially against living things
[2:36:05] <%13ry4n93> @Shadowpint she was from an area that was colonized by the british
[2:36:06] <DHB05> ok cool
[2:36:07] <+lugraylucid> Pat what are Acid Rounds good against?
[2:36:13] <rytisone> no floor creaking in original
[2:36:14] <Ranger747> no clowns farting in the basement
[2:36:15] <Gruntini> RE6 is a goddamn nightmare
[2:36:17] <Froyuken> Is Yawn still in that room at this point?
[2:36:18] <Alseid> Why is Deadly Silence the best?
[2:36:18] <%13ry4n93> @Shadowpint I guess
[2:36:21] <Bagelborn> @HyperBomb21 I don't agree with you at all but I respect that opinion

[2:36:36] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> What things that are dead inside, like me?
[2:36:37] <dukenux> What do you THINK of it?
[2:36:37] <Graxe_> While a bad descriptor, that is an important distinction
[2:36:38] <+el_thag> Remember kids: Duel Shock = Clown Farts!
[2:36:39] <$Blackgaver> but everything is dead though LUL
[2:36:39] <Neo_Kaiser> Acid rounds kills Yawn in a couple of hits
[2:36:40] <Froyuken> Especially!
[2:36:42] <danielmorn> But how powerful are they against doors?
[2:36:42] <lionandfox21> That line is the weirdest hint
[2:36:42] <allanmiri> Basically use them on Yawn
[2:36:43] <goddamndavid> but zombies are DEEAAAD
[2:36:44] <%nofestu2> HE SAID THE THING
[2:36:44] <%legendscar01> Why does pat have a huge penis?
[2:36:45] <%13ry4n93> @Shadowpint or maybe she went to a british university
[2:36:45] <simulationbard> Bu aren't you fighting the undead
[2:36:45] <+skyheys> Nobody gives Deadly Silence enough respect
[2:36:47] <Graxe_> Because Hunters are not zombies
[2:36:47] <@ShockzNDrawe> ur so stupid that line is great
[2:36:47] <zenith0111> Guys Donald Trump just got impeached
[2:36:47] <%Captain_Joe1911> apatOrange
[2:36:50] <DHB05> how is your cat doing?
[2:36:52] <+Jolnir> I want to put my ass in shevas ass
[2:36:54] <HyperBomb21> @Bagelborn I love the story and characters, but those survival horror sections are jsut tedious
[2:36:55] <theangryguyofde> Resident Evil DS LUL
[2:36:55] <Dhurkst> A CAN OF FIZZ. IT OUGHT TO YELLOW AND MELLOW THOSE GHOULIES.
[2:36:57] <+Shadowpint> RE 5 makes me cringe cuz of how obnoxiously sexist it is tbh
[2:36:59] <rytisone> Barry is STARS. He knows what he's saying
[2:36:59] <danielmorn> or other inanimate objects
[2:36:59] <+WarbossMetal> hunters and snakes are living things :0
[2:36:59] <@ShockzNDrawe> I love the VAing in this game
[2:37:00] <%comfyman12> Are you gonna play on the superior PC version of RE3? I managed to find a "legitimate" copy of it and got it to work flawlessly
[2:37:01] <$Blackgaver> @zenith0111 MAN who gives a fuuuudge
[2:37:01] <mirfosevik> @zenith0111 radical
[2:37:01] <majima666> i wouldnt have it any other way though
[2:37:02] <Neo_Kaiser> Guys we gotta fight Misty!
[2:37:05] <Ultimatefool> Chat, did we get to OH MY COD yet
[2:37:07] <Fujiwara_92> BARRY IS RIGHT THO, YOU CAN'T SAY HE'S LYING
[2:37:09] <peachy996> @zenith0111 trial has to happen first
[2:37:14] <%rasterman> doesn't that imply they're better for hunters rather than zombies?
[2:37:15] <%BayowolfTerra> Do you prescribe to the theory the track was just given the wrong MIDI instrument?
[2:37:16] <%13ry4n93> so is pat going to play the best version of RE:2?
[2:37:20] <waifoong98> acid round is strong against alkaline metal obviously Kappa
[2:37:20] <Froyuken> Time for the guest house.
[2:37:27] <+ShazBo2000> Duh tank controls 😂😂😂
[2:37:28] <lionandfox21> @rasterman Yeah, but its a dumb hint
[2:37:30] <%legendscar01> Pat's golden rule......NO HEALTH
[2:37:33] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @peachy996 Trump IS impeached. Just not removed out of office.
[2:37:36] <%13ry4n93> I'm talking, of course, about RE:2 on the ***
[2:37:38] <@ShockzNDrawe> aka things that aren't dead zombos
[2:37:44] <%13ry4n93> or gamecom
[2:37:52] <Graxe_> Nothing rotting
[2:37:53] <Monkroot> zombies aren't "zombies" ?
[2:37:54] <deviljhojho_> it is
[2:37:56] <peachy996> @Zaphire_Saucypants Neat.
[2:37:56] <lotharrio> Just infected... until RE6, where the zombies are crawling out of graves for some reason.
[2:37:57] <天使42199> @Zaphire_Saucypants Yeah but him being impeached... does that not now limit his power ?
[2:38:00] <Bagelborn> @HyperBomb21 oh absolutely. I wish there was a mod that made those sections WAY shorter
[2:38:01] <HyperBomb21> @Zaphire_Saucypants tumpint IS NOT impeached until senate passes it
[2:38:06] <+Shadowpint> Play the N64 version of RE2 Pat
[2:38:06] <majima666> game com version of re2 stream confirmed
[2:38:08] <$Blackgaver> maybe because it's a strong enough acid to boil up the bones..
[2:38:10] <+el_thag> Zombies technically aren’t dead sorta
[2:38:10] <+windsoc> hey pat, how far into the game exactly is the guard house, for those of us who havent played RE1?
[2:38:11] <Make_me_mad> There were zombies crawling out of graves in code veronica, also.
[2:38:12] <Graxe_> Zombies are still rotting and falling apart even if they aren't technically dead
[2:38:16] <%TIME_PUNCHER> I feel like highlighted messages for channel points are a mistake because people can ramble on for as long as possible with a veritable wall of text that doesn't actually say anything, but takes up a huge amount of space with an obnoxious highlighted colour. Perhaps the best bet is to either raise the point cost or to simply remove highlighted messages altogether. Am I writing this ironically? Or am I accurately showing the problems with this feature? I'll leave that for you to decide. But yes.
[2:38:17] <%13ry4n93> yeah
[2:38:19] <Froyuken> I think it did.
[2:38:21] <+cjl1991> guys, lets not talk politics. I came here to relax
[2:38:23] <grimm_hatter> trump is the senste
[2:38:25] <+skyheys> Yes, it's horrifying.
[2:38:28] <FriendlyCheer> Game com Active
[2:38:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @TIME_PUNCHER hey alright
[2:38:28] <majima666> yeah, it did
[2:38:29] <+Jolnir> Re5 remake when
[2:38:32] <tripessolides> yeah it did
[2:38:33] <peachy996> Can we finally stop talking about that presidential attention whore and go back to the videogames
[2:38:35] <lionandfox21> @Monkroot In this game, "zombies" are people who have been infected with the T virus via water exposure
[2:38:36] <%Chichen> incredible
[2:38:37] <Bagelborn> @TIME_PUNCHER well done
[2:38:37] <Dhurkst> BIG THINK
[2:38:38] <AMajorTom> There’s no death because they are all cursed
[2:38:38] <TurtlesAndTentacles> WAIT WHEN DID WE START?! OhNo! I'm Late!
[2:38:38] <+el_thag> Y’all check the wiki on the clay virus
[2:38:39] <%13ry4n93> the gamecom was the mobile game system made by Tiger Electronics
[2:38:40] <%legendscar01> Are these "Walkers or Zombies"
[2:38:40] <$Blackgaver> wtf LUL
[2:38:42] <Tracazoid> A real brain teaser
[2:38:42] <42nfl19> WHAT DOES IT MEAN
[2:38:43] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> @HyperBomb21 NO, Senate can REMOVE him from office, but the impeachment stays next to his name in history. Like Clinton.
[2:38:44] <RubberFistFight> fuck yeah full cream milk is delicious. Fuck this 2% shit, 3.8% full cream is where it's at. And if there's EXTRA cream available? fucking bonus.
[2:38:45] <deviljhojho_> top tier

[2:38:47] <%starotter70> @TIME_PUNCHER Either way, I respect it
[2:38:47] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 38m.
[2:38:47] <DrkJP520> What about the zombies that literally rise from their graves in Code Veronica for example? wouldn't they be considered undead?
[2:38:47] <deviljhojho_> really!
[2:38:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> Who knew that organic material became acid-resistant after necrotic enhancement by a bioweapon
[2:38:49] <@ShockzNDrawe> Stop talkin about politics

[2:50:14] <%smugjorgen98> @guardian_collin you are crazy this game looks great
[2:50:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> Only way to test, save right before the end of the game, beat it and get score, reload save, use first aid spray, beat the game the same exact way.
[2:50:15] <lionandfox21> That was true in RE2 but I'm not sure in RE1
[2:50:17] <+Shadowpint> It depends on how many you use in RE2
[2:50:18] <+trekkie11041> @XeroSigmaPrime nope
[2:50:19] <%13ry4n93> anyways, I'm currently playing through reach again
[2:50:20] <navarroguard> in re2 it does

[2:50:48] <%legendscar01> I have 1k points
[2:50:49] <tripessolides> It's even worse in silent hill 2. You get insane amount of ammunition
[2:50:58] <kingbaconcrispy> @Sphincter_Spelunker Nemesis is the one they send when they want someone to get whacked.
[2:50:58] <navarroguard> G+R and sprays affected rank in 2
[2:50:58] <dukenux> *notebook
[2:51:00] <Froyuken> @kingbaconcrispy You sure? I thought all the classic REs had the F.Aid Spray reduce your rank.
