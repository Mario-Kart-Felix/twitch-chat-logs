[0:18:35] <%doctordinkus> we gotta catch him tweeting during one of these poo breaks
[0:18:37] <+farrellcityking> That’s what he gets for letting the dog lick him in the face. Now he has worms

[0:18:39] <PanicSwytch> I imagine Pat also pisses and shits the bed
[0:18:47] <%saadi90> He will do it at his wedding
[0:18:50] <%RealThiele> Pat would poop someone elses butt
[0:18:57] <+Fabpsi_> but a little bit more serious: I hope you feel better / things are doing good right now. Take your time

[0:55:56] <mattdaddyd101> for like 5 secs
[0:55:56] <Estuko> You know, with this universe kind of being the opposite it makes sense that she probably hasn't beaten her badguy once because he's so competent and dangerous

[0:59:55] <s1rcuit> it was in 3 as well
[0:59:56] <DublinRage> @raikagelord1 I was *just* thinking that

[1:00:15] <%StaceMcGate> Blaster, Flamethrower, Arc Tesla, Rocket Launcher, Bomb Glove, Glove of Doom
[1:00:21] <raikagelord1> Wait when did he upgrade the cold snap and what does it do?
[1:00:23] <Laseki> you can lock it on to multiple targets
[1:00:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> instantly dead lol
[1:00:49] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @PatStaresAt you're supposed to do a lock-on to hit multiple targets with the Drillhound (half-pull)
[1:00:50] <raikagelord1> Yeah it can lock on to multiple targets
[1:00:55] <%doctordinkus> until it is done
[1:01:07] <%brisk_dacat> Still got funguy
[1:01:14] <+Hyphixsys> they actually call out the weapons in this LUL
[1:01:17] <s1rcuit> more Geifier
[1:01:27] <mattdaddyd101> BEEF
[1:01:29] <+Hyphixsys> that selfie LUL
[1:01:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so Drillhound isn't the best against bosses unless they have multiple attack points

[1:01:39] <%RealThiele> mortis beefer
[1:01:46] <+Hyphixsys> PUMPED UP

[1:01:56] <%CappuccinoGuil> HELL YEAH OVERCHARGE!
[1:01:58] <dan_g_v> phuckd
[1:02:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you sort of have to use Fungal, because it's the ASs-saver
[1:02:01] <MechanizedGentleman> so much juice your heart will never stop
[1:02:03] <Dunmarkh> pat will never lock on with the drillhound
[1:02:04] <brachydios777> MONEY
[1:02:04] <ToneBacas> absorbing juice cans straight into his body
[1:02:04] <JonnyJug> Getting that Red Bull sponsorship

[1:02:09] <samwantsham> psaWrong
[1:02:11] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Do you think Pig will ever get a buff in DBD
[1:02:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Fungal and Doompup
[1:02:12] <%brisk_dacat> Collect can like a homeless lombax
[1:02:15] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt you have enough for a gun
[1:02:18] <%Robot_Nixon_> CHAOS?
[1:02:18] <+Hyphixsys> @s1rcuit that's really good attention to detail
[1:02:20] <raikagelord1> Your being showers in energy drinks. LUL LUL LUL
[1:02:29] <satans_finest_millennial> ah stinky lombussy of power, anointed by the dimentionator
[1:02:29] <%RealThiele> rocket jump?
[1:02:38] <s1rcuit> @Hyphixsys it's the little things
[1:02:41] <MechanizedGentleman> use it though
[1:02:49] <StarMechV> IT's from a previous game
[1:02:55] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the EARLY Warmonger isn't as good, but MAXED OUT it fucks
[1:02:55] <mattdaddyd101> gun to murder
[1:03:10] <StarMechV> Zurkon Jr. Says Fuck the Police
[1:03:12] <%Faustgesicht> but the xp tho
[1:03:26] <+Hyphixsys> @s1rcuit I'd want a game, that you can use a rubber shoe, and NPCs will yell that you're using a rubber shoe LUL
[1:03:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you want to Max out Warmonger
[1:03:45] <%StaceMcGate> squishy
[1:03:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> YES
[1:03:59] <%legendfather_of_giants> you REALLY want to max out Warmonger
[1:04:02] <MechanizedGentleman> make weapon stronger, pat
[1:04:03] <Profmcstevie> Level up weapons? Are you suuuure
[1:04:09] <StarMechV> you still need to buy it tho Pat
[1:04:10] <Psyramics> yeah, you gotta max it out so you can never use it again
[1:04:12] <gslayer14> you don't want to max it out actually
[1:04:14] <vVAstrAVv> u can break boxes by p dashing through them
[1:04:14] <RiverBirch> no you dont Kappa
[1:04:16] <gslayer14> then you wont use it
[1:04:17] <+ScrapKingKeita> idk, not sure if worth Kappa
[1:04:19] <s1rcuit> @Hyphixsys while being indignant about it, like "he's killing us with a rubber shoe?! seriously?!"
[1:04:33] <+Hyphixsys> @s1rcuit LUL
[1:04:34] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt also remember your hoverboots
[1:04:35] <+Totally_Not_Toby> you can use the rocket boots to get around faster
[1:04:43] <mattdaddyd101> lombussy juice
[1:04:44] <+Totally_Not_Toby> that's how i beat the challenge
[1:04:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> one thing I did learn about this game is its actually BAD to use your wrench, because you lose the Weapon EXP
[1:05:05] <%StaceMcGate> the juice is loose...wait
[1:05:12] <%legendfather_of_giants> yes
[1:05:15] <s1rcuit> probably
[1:05:16] <+SocialMisfitGamer> yep
[1:05:43] <%ssjklyco> When you fight the boss during the Arena, you get a ton of Gun XP per hit and you can repeat it. Its the level 5 silver challenge
[1:05:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yes after beating and Platinuming the game, it does feel too short and not nearly enough enemy variety
[1:05:50] <MechanizedGentleman> pat just firing rockets into the audience LUL
[1:06:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you fight THAT guy like 12 times
[1:06:02] <s1rcuit> it does an extra 2% to bosses
[1:06:23] <+SocialMisfitGamer> @ssjklyco it would be best for Pat to to grind that challenge either on or offscreen
[1:06:30] <avidneptune> Rocket boots pat
[1:06:49] <mrpotatohead0312> Hey Pat, is this game better than the remake of 1? Unless this is the first one you've played in which I say thats neat I hope you are enjoying it!

[1:07:13] <+vaderxyz1970> Shove it up the Lambussy

[1:11:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> Dad Bod Kreygasm
[1:11:59] <s1rcuit> so are you though
[1:12:01] <rosemon5001> dad boss
[1:12:32] <%asgard147> limesOmg
[1:12:32] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I suppose right from Super Mario 1, we were repeating bosses
[1:12:34] <%Monkeyweed21> lol Pat forgot about perfect timing
[1:12:37] <%greasypete00> yeyeye
[1:12:38] <%xmetalicdemonx> and it looks amazing
[1:12:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and things like Mega Man
[1:12:43] <+Totally_Not_Toby> all ratchet and clank gimmick weapons always work on bosses
[1:12:46] <+Totally_Not_Toby> it's the best
[1:12:53] <%ssjklyco> Look at that XP
[1:12:54] <Marpolo13> wtf
[1:12:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> giratina?
[1:12:55] <StarMechV> All weapons work with ALL enemies
[1:12:57] <StarMechV> even the final boss
[1:12:58] <+Totally_Not_Toby> think groovitron
[1:13:02] <%asgard147> I love these games limesLove
[1:13:04] <s1rcuit> @Monkeyweed21 did he even know about it in the first place?
[1:13:08] <+BIumen> groovitron flashbacks
[1:13:20] <%brisk_dacat> All weapons work in all bosses apparently
[1:13:21] <mark1247> @s1rcuit she got bored but love the last 6 hours, but dont know if she played the DLC with the 13 new bosses & secret bosses
[1:13:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> did they fix the cold snap/Lightning glitch cheat?
[1:13:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Buzz Blades are great on him and Warmonger
[1:13:49] <%SolidusRex> Remember the games where the morphing weapons worked on bosses, and you could turn them into chickens/sheep/ducks?
[1:13:51] <%toolofparanoia> Its neato
[1:14:01] <s1rcuit> @mark1247 is that when the trolls came in?
[1:14:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Buzz Blades seek out targets and tehn do damage over time
[1:14:29] <$Ziegsy> @ShinobiPhoenix cheat?
[1:14:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> cold into lightning into cold
[1:14:55] <%xmetalicdemonx> might as well use the sprinkler

[1:15:14] <%Shubreaker> COLLIDER
[1:15:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> does Pat not have Buzz Blades?
[1:15:26] <s1rcuit> the glove of doom might work, and the warmonger
[1:15:32] <%Mattais88> Dance, Fern!
[1:16:11] <s1rcuit> it's just melting now
[1:16:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Buzz Blades, Sprinkler, Fungal, and Warmonger are my loadout for repeating this boss for Raritarium
[1:16:55] <mark1247> @s1rcuit somethin else
[1:16:59] <+brightman42> Ratchet/Rivet have like over 30 adds if you toss out everything, shit gets crazy
[1:17:06] <+kullumanati> Could of had infinite ammo Reno 8 with all collectibles at this point
[1:17:27] <%toolofparanoia> thats pretty stylin
[1:17:28] <%athuramn> this is so visually satisfying
[1:17:32] <%Mattais88> Cyrax?
[1:17:33] <rosemon5001> you dont have to worry about raritanium in this game you get an overflow of it so you can upgrade to your hearts content
[1:17:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I did that color scheme on Ratchet
[1:17:36] <Pyon84> Damn it, this game seems really fun man.
[1:17:41] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I went Red Ranger for Rivet
[1:17:53] <%bravebravesrobin> Hey Pat, I have a unique/niche game request. Could you play the recent remake of computer game Outcast (1999) called Outcast: Second Contact. Besides the Zork series and the Myst series, it was my favorite game from the era; plus, it still has some of that Euro-jank you love so well. Oh yeah, kiss Gief and Elmo and pet Mustard Lady. Cheer1000

[1:33:51] <+bmj614> Would Ratchet getting with Rivet be like getting with your twin sister?
[1:33:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I HATE Fidelity on this game
[1:33:55] <DartAran> Rivet actually does have bigger arm muscle than Ratchet if you look close
[1:33:57] <%toolofparanoia> its a curse
[1:33:59] <%Skelefellah> Fun fact - we almost just did 60 FPS only with no RT, but we found some good solutions for it.

[1:41:12] <%Skelefellah> There will be no goopification
[1:41:14] <+Totally_Not_Toby> kzxBald KEYBLADE kzxBald
[1:41:16] <Saltmeisterr> man tropical freeze is a good game
[1:41:17] <Dunmarkh> flatten that bussy
[1:41:17] <RickyRelucent> would feel somewhat appropriate too, there's a sly cooper reference, you're wielding a keyblade
[1:41:17] <mattdaddyd101> 0/10 ign
[1:41:21] <%xmetalicdemonx> I wanted a lara croft death but for ratchet
[1:41:21] <%SolidusRex> @AdmiralButtloaf Rivet is the 8th light, didn't you know?
[1:41:23] <RickyRelucent> inb4 sony cinematic universe
[1:41:25] <KeiPrime> is that a keyblade or THE X-blade
[1:41:26] <+MightyDuckShoes> @totally_not_toby And that just makes me think of Beetlejuice
[1:41:32] <gslayer14> [pirate ASMR 2 hours]
[1:41:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> they didn't come out and make it clip through
[1:41:41] <%joodatious> jesus this game is gorgeous

[1:42:28] <%SolidusRex> Tako Tuesday, but Wednesday
[1:42:30] <notsoy> ricochet pls
[1:42:36] <%Skelefellah> S'cuz you're using fewer weapons - the game's built to try and get you to use more variety.
[1:42:38] <gslayer14> if only you had 10+ guns with full ammo.....
[1:42:39] <+ScrapKingKeita> Ricochet crying
[1:42:40] <RickyRelucent> feels like alphabet propaganda
[1:42:46] <Dunmarkh> ammo pool widens everytime you buy a gun
[1:42:52] <%SolidusRex> You can level the Ricochet still
[1:42:58] <ididstuff666x> EARNED THAT LEVEL LUL
[1:42:59] <nuane> what is going on

[1:43:34] <ScreamLord> PS5 is beefy
[1:43:34] <%QueequegTheater> B A N A N A S
[1:43:47] <RickyRelucent> The game looks very pretty, but it did take a entire console before this came out
[1:43:56] <RickyRelucent> or did i miss something inbetween this and quest for booty
[1:44:01] <jorniev> what would nack look on ps5?
[1:44:03] <+redthebaron> become pirate
[1:44:08] <RickyRelucent> oh.....right...q force
[1:44:10] <mattdaddyd101> big money
[1:44:18] <RickyRelucent> and the remaster!
[1:44:20] <%Skelefellah> @PatStaresAt The game almost came out in 60 non-RT mode since we encountered a lot of issues with optimizing for combat scenarios... But let's just say our core team were godlike in helping solve that.
[1:44:20] <+MightyDuckShoes> My God. Imagine Dynasty Warriors on this system.... No? Imagine!
[1:44:26] <wolfen091> see, French evil
[1:44:34] <Dunmarkh> @RickyRelucent don't talk about q force

[1:47:45] <%CappuccinoGuil> If you buy a new gun, that's the same as buying ammo.
[1:47:47] <RickyRelucent> >bombadier sucks? But buzzblades have such horrible rep!
[1:47:47] <BigFingerRo> it's DIFREEEEENT
[1:47:48] <s1rcuit> fair enough
[1:47:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I didin't like using it at all
[1:48:02] <RetributionP> yes and buzz blades is a weapon that hasn't run out of ammo
[1:48:03] <rosemon5001> bombadier is more of a crowd control one
[1:48:06] <andrewofbob> Money spent on ammo is money you can't spend on guns
[1:48:12] <vVAstrAVv> thats why you buy ammo.... to keep leveling them
[1:48:16] <MechanizedGentleman> yes, I too love electromagnetic radiation
[1:48:16] <%legendfather_of_giants> @RickyRelucent not because they're bad, but because they've been in a LOT of the games

[1:51:05] <BigFingerRo> huh, never have seen the cans up close
[1:51:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ladydimitres using the keyblade would eat up his EXP
[1:51:09] <%Mattais88> Symetra Gun

[1:51:12] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt pat these enemies are all dying in 1, why are you wasting ammo?

[1:51:59] <RickyRelucent> tHAts the booty of it, ratchet
[1:52:07] <RickyRelucent> the treasure is inside the eye of the beholder
[1:52:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ladydimitres or to be exact: using the wrench means you aren't using a weapon, and weapons make contact to get EXP from usage, so using a wrench means the weapon isn't growing
[1:52:47] <+xilmarinenx> The booty was the Jaffe's that we owned along the way
[1:52:53] <ididstuff666x> "Protect th-BOOM"

[1:54:34] <%ShinobiPhoenix> now the Warmonger can fuck
[1:54:38] <rosemon5001> finally one streamer that isnt afraid to upgrade the pixelizer
[1:54:51] <RickyRelucent> not sure how clank expect a pier to be
[1:55:02] <RickyRelucent> usually pretty boaty and seaweedy
[1:55:08] <vVAstrAVv> whys upgrading pixelize4 bad?
[1:55:12] <nuane> I thought they were packaging peanuts
[1:55:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Pixelizer is a different effect shotgun, the executor is faster and stronger, but Pixelizer can heal
[1:55:30] <$Ziegsy> its not monster, its four loko
[1:55:31] <Dunmarkh> @vVAstrAVv preorder gun or something
[1:55:35] <RickyRelucent> atleast your catching it now
[1:55:35] <Manwad> member when you got the box breaker in rachet 3, you use it on the ship, and the framerate fucking dies
[1:55:42] <RickyRelucent> *but i'm so use to pitching*
[1:55:58] <s1rcuit> A RADIO, GET AWAY FROM IT
[1:55:58] <%Vyskus> I honestly didn't think the cans had a texture until we got a freeze frame on weapon change
[1:56:01] <%Skelefellah> SPEETLE TIME WOO
[1:56:03] <RiverBirch> quietly *called it*
[1:56:09] <vVAstrAVv> @dunmarkh thats dumb then cus i didnt preorder and you still get pixelizer for new game plus
[1:56:09] <$Ziegsy> FUN FACT: Grog is any alcohol watered down to make it last longer! usually rum
[1:56:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> right is treasure, left is mission
[1:56:14] <%Crookedspiral> is this a Slurm reference?
[1:56:19] <RickyRelucent> I like how they literrally lifted this from the precurser legacy
[1:56:30] <ladydimitres> I need to go need to complete KHBBBS have a great stream Pat and chat
[1:56:31] <RetributionP> how does he know to hop on that thing?
[1:56:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> mission it is
[1:56:37] <ladydimitres> KonCha
[1:56:43] <RickyRelucent> never see someone reach that far back for a mechanic anymore
[1:56:44] <gslayer14> can you just use the boots on water?
[1:56:46] <%Skelefellah> @You miiiiighta missed a gold bolt takin' the fast way off the speetle there
[1:56:47] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt you went in the direction of mission instead of treasure
[1:56:51] <Dunmarkh> @vVAstrAVv you get it early with preorder
[1:56:53] <%Skelefellah> Oop nice job me
[1:56:54] <%Vyskus> @RickyRelucent if we're never getting aa new Jak game they might as well

[1:58:26] <StarMechV> Love that they recorded Ratchet¿s "What?" thinking its his name
[1:58:26] <ididstuff666x> DIDNEY WORL

[2:03:30] <RetributionP> pat had no idea in his head

[2:16:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @MechanizedGentleman you sir are a liar
[2:16:04] <ididstuff666x> Wow crazy how I immediately despise this Qwark too
[2:16:05] <%DianaTheAscian> Paige is existing again
[2:16:06] <%Rookie_Balboa> Rookie_Balboa subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 18 months thats two whole babies wowzah. Hope you have/had a good stream, been replaying ME1 with my gf and I feel like she's judging me for being a Tali liker. There's just something about the mask, y'know?
[2:16:24] <RickyRelucent> letshope she just bumped into something head first.
[2:16:29] <+fetrigon> paige is summoning the end of the world oh boy
[2:16:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> he just tries to Han Solo his way out of stuff
[2:16:39] <teefpal> i just got here so I have no opinion yet on red quark
[2:16:41] <RickyRelucent> GO TO THE OPTOLOGIST PAIGE
[2:16:50] <%StaceMcGate> Paige tried to open the peanut butter and started an electrical fire
[2:17:05] <BigFingerRo> @RickyRelucent paige only goes to the oppatamahowajist
[2:17:11] <%Skelefellah> Paige's existence once again challenging and defying life's struggles
[2:17:14] <RickyRelucent> Maybe its a random hater throwing bricks at the windows
[2:17:25] <RickyRelucent> for paige being paige
[2:17:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but he actually earns his respect and admiration, the opponent of Green Qwerk
[2:17:32] <%MosesUnspoken> MosesUnspoken subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Take Jeff Bezos money.
[2:17:41] <%Monkeyweed21> Qwark would commit a sex offense, not because he's a sex pest but because he's hanging out with Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey and wants to seem cool
[2:18:05] <$Ziegsy> R E L O A D
[2:18:08] <+fetrigon> @rickyrelucent it's nothing to do with sight. Just impulse control I think.
[2:18:18] <raikagelord1> Hope Paige is and am I the only one who actually likes Qwark?
[2:18:24] <RickyRelucent> lack thereof
[2:18:29] <%StaceMcGate> Ferengi are just living, breathing sex offenses. Big plot that a progressive Ferengi leader no longer made it mandatory for Ferengi females to be naked when outside
[2:18:36] <+fetrigon> @rickyrelucent yep
[2:18:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Quantum is legit great, Qwark, not so much
[2:18:47] <RickyRelucent> Some ppl just start they're first run of life on extra hard
[2:18:49] <JittersCaffeine> @raikagelord1 I appreciate him as a part of the games and story.
[2:19:10] <RickyRelucent> >they're, my europoor is showing
[2:19:19] <%StaceMcGate> I saw Qwark and immediately went to Deep Space 9
[2:19:30] <raikagelord1> I mean Qwark is a terrible person but makes a decent villain and good side character. But yeah Quantum seems great.
[2:19:34] <penitentpendant> Could be worse(?) could have been a FemQuark
[2:19:49] <%Dakuu75> pls no
[2:19:55] <raikagelord1> I just like the Captain Space hero guy stchick
[2:20:00] <%StaceMcGate> FemQuark would be a super competent muscle girl
[2:20:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> not sure why a Female Qwark would be bad
[2:20:37] <%HairballCT> HairballCT subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! psaBig 3 months psaUp
[2:20:37] <%Dakuu75> if we got a femQwuark, I want a male Helga~ "Hanz"
[2:20:41] <s1rcuit> @ShinobiPhoenix because it'd end up exactly like in 3
[2:20:48] <penitentpendant> @ShinobiPhoenix Ye olde gag of "Oh no, other me is HOT"
[2:21:04] <RickyRelucent> Female quark: Commandate Queef
[2:21:16] <teefpal> You could still have that with male quark you coward
[2:21:19] <RickyRelucent> Commandante*
[2:21:21] <%StaceMcGate> so its been multiple minutes, should we worry?
[2:21:42] <mattdaddyd101> did Paige die
[2:21:45] <raikagelord1> I have been worrying.
[2:21:47] <+withguac> No offense but how often does Pat take breaks? It seems like a bit much
[2:21:51] <%Magewart> yeah i was just thinking about that
[2:21:59] <RickyRelucent> I'm sure we'll know by the time the next hour rolls by
[2:22:03] <%baka_sugoi> gief murdered paige
[2:22:04] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @StaceMcGate Paige could've just spilled honey mustard everywhere
[2:22:20] <$Ziegsy> @withguac depends. I mean its not really an issue, is it?
[2:22:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @teefpal if Qwark was narcissist bisexual, I wouldn't even be mad
[2:22:23] <%Magewart> geif got into paiges mustard
[2:22:26] <RickyRelucent> prolly just cut her finger
[2:22:26] <teefpal> I dont want to say anything, hope its not actually bad
[2:22:29] <%StaceMcGate> @withguac often, he lives in a fucking zoo. Gief will interrupt the stream at least 8 times per night
[2:22:30] <+FoolsArcade> @withguac No offense, but this question seems like a bit much.
[2:22:45] <%Dakuu75> @withguac I mean, he does live in a zoo and with a Paige
[2:22:55] <raikagelord1> @withguac well something is going with his fiancé so this time is an exception. Could be nothing could be something.
[2:23:02] <%robotoken> Paige got into the hurty sand again

[2:32:34] <%Dakuu75> that super dynamic hero-standing-up moment lol

[2:33:57] <%toolofparanoia> The Quantum leaped to hell LUL
[2:34:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> because you would assume he got thrown into a black hole, which Emperor N is KNOWN for doing to his enemies
[2:34:04] <RickyRelucent> new nefarius isn't shit, he just has an easymode ratchhet
[2:34:13] <RickyRelucent> now, old nefarious on the other hand
[2:34:13] <ScreamLord> The Buzz Blades have always been busted
[2:34:37] <RickyRelucent> You need to spec it for maximum bounce
[2:34:38] <%Kurgash> I love that the TF2 medic voices emperor nefarious
[2:34:40] <Dunmarkh> probably better after upgrade
[2:35:00] <RickyRelucent> I miss the throw animation from 2

[2:41:30] <%QueequegTheater> Guys it's a sports team Pat actually knows the name of, OF COURSE it's hockey
[2:41:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> Montreal Tampa isn't 1-1, it's 1-0 for Tampa. The game is smack dab in the middle right now

[2:42:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I haven't decided to do Challenge Mode, but do you still need Raritarium in Challenge Mode?
[2:42:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat is telling you if you're canadian and the habs win, you can flip a cop car in his honor.

[2:42:17] <%QueequegTheater> @captainpodock fair
[2:42:24] <%RonaldMcDownload> destroying cop cars is a waste. Steal, repurpose as battle wagons
[2:42:26] <%bread_assassin> It's really a win for everybody.
[2:42:27] <mattdaddyd101> Sassy Baka
[2:42:33] <chrishansen69_> cop cars suck.. they wanna lead instead of pat..

[2:43:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @legendfather_of_giants I bought the post game weapons (or weapon because pre-order) for the Plat, and stopped playing there
[2:43:34] <Saltmeisterr> Man path of pain was somethin
[2:43:38] <%StaceMcGate> Shovel Knight was nearly 7 years ago, Hollow Knight was nearly 5 years ago @PatStaresAt
[2:43:39] <chrishansen69_> canada dodged a bullet
[2:43:45] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> When sequel?
[2:43:46] <teefpal> damn why does it take so long to get back to the ship
[2:43:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> my platinum was VERY anticlimatic

[2:44:24] <%Skelefellah> Burger time psaDogchamp
[2:44:24] <chrishansen69_> burger on toilet is win
[2:44:26] <teefpal> @StaceMcGate no i feel old
[2:44:28] <mattdaddyd101> Burger Juice
[2:44:47] <%pandapeeps> HEY! It's my favorite streamer! How's the gang?
[2:45:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Skelefellah since I assume they were worked on at the same time, you didn't work on Miles Morales too right?
[2:45:53] <%Monkeyweed21> @pandapeeps Zangief set the house on fire and Pat has a big case of the stupids today
[2:46:00] <%Skelefellah> @Skelefellah I did! I worked on Miles' Venom, Roxxon, Holo-Training and Prowler's stuff.
[2:46:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> did you move right to Ratchet soon as Miles was about to hit manufacture?
[2:46:51] <%StaceMcGate> Pat needs a special BRB menu for Gief
[2:46:51] <%pandapeeps> @Monkeyweed21 Fantastic, was wondering if he was really eating borgors on the toilet. Geif just be vibin tho.
[2:47:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I now know who to direct my anger at for the SOFTLOCKING I got in Miles Morales because of buying my suits early
[2:47:36] <%NocturneNovember> Wait, is there an Insomniac dev here?
[2:47:38] <%Skelefellah> Granted that meant coming to Ratchet later in development, but I was still able to work on weapons like the Shatterbomb, Black Hole Gun, and the Ryno. I did a few other things, but that's spoilery.
[2:47:44] <%StaceMcGate> if anyone eats burgers on the toilet, it is Paige. Pat eats his coward candy in the closet
[2:47:47] <Profmcstevie> Dev is in chat yes
[2:48:19] <%NocturneNovember> Oh nice!
[2:48:24] <%QueequegTheater> Devs are watching
[2:48:34] <%Skelefellah> The nice thing with being a VFX Artist is you're later in the pipeline for the development process, so coming in later's totally fine.
[2:48:35] <%Dakuu75> Twitter is fucking BUSTED as fuck for me right now. can't post or read comments on tweets
[2:48:39] <%StaceMcGate> @Skelefellah Just curious on why so few enemy variants? Were more planned but scrapped?
[2:48:40] <%QueequegTheater> Is it that dev that said Rivet was specifically designed to create furries?
[2:48:59] <%Ranryu692> oh cool
[2:49:00] <%Skelefellah> @PatStaresAt Oh shoosh I've been watchin' yer jazz for years, man. Don't stress it.
[2:49:08] <tcosmiclatte> confirmed, Zangief is a Predacon
[2:49:09] <%asgard147> I don't wanna
[2:49:09] <%StaceMcGate> @QueequegTheater I'm pretty sure the official twitter straight up said that
[2:49:09] <%Dakuu75> that's the secret goal of any furry art
[2:49:13] <%SaiyanShoto> Can’t wait for terrible twos with Zangief

[2:49:38] <%NocturneNovember> Gief is a secret krogan
[2:49:42] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt He's basically the bulldog equivalent of an eight year old
[2:49:48] <Profmcstevie> He needs a battle cohort
[2:49:49] <$Ziegsy> Bug fables makes me SO motion sick
[2:49:54] <SilverFaustX> get a big wheel like a hamster
[2:50:01] <%Skelefellah> @Skelefellah I can't specify state the hows'n'whys, but there WAS a reason for that for the greater good.

[2:50:34] <RickyRelucent> getting in there is wha he dislikes
[2:50:36] <%SaiyanShoto> He looks so squishy in the face
[2:50:39] <%Skelefellah> He's such a child - a really strong muscle child
[2:50:41] <no123450n> peta!
[2:50:43] <%pandapeeps> Pat, please. I have been wondering for so long. Are those rocks behind you natural or like is that a wallpaper?
[2:50:44] <%RyTYoung> @patstaresat are you playing more Ratchet tonight or nah?
[2:50:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I was starting to try out Returnal for a quick one run to use my new Midnight Black Dualsense, but then Pat came on
[2:51:02] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Downloading Judgement right now, dub orsub

[2:51:14] <$Ziegsy> At what part of a games development do they test to make sure its accessible? Like so many games recently have not been epileptic friendly its WILD
[2:51:15] <%Dakuu75> he fucking RUNS with that shit. lol
[2:51:18] <JonnyJug> Almost lost a finger
[2:51:20] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so now,I am watching Pat and writing development notes for my game
[2:51:23] <%Skelefellah> @PatStaresAt Enjoy one of the biggest pains in the arse for optimizing 60 FPS RT mode
[2:51:30] <%GarbageNirvana> BORK GODDAMMIT
[2:51:31] <AthenaAegis> *BARK* IMGONENOW lol

[2:52:11] <BigCoffee> Oh shit the girls are finally together?
[2:52:17] <BigCoffee> since when
[2:52:18] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it can be
[2:52:20] <%Monkeyweed21> GET THAT CLUSSY
[2:52:21] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt it actually is this time tho
[2:52:32] <umbraawitch> aww
[2:52:33] <NickHatesSnow> Kit with harsh reality
[2:52:36] <Profmcstevie> Kit and Ratchet were a more fun dynamic
[2:52:39] <%QueequegTheater> Pat your degree is in psychology
[2:52:39] <%toolofparanoia> I want a Rivet & Kit game now
[2:52:42] <%CappuccinoGuil> @BigCoffee a bit earlier, the 4 met up, shit went down and they swapped bots
[2:52:48] <%Dakuu75> I wonder if she wass about to say like, "Maybe this is jsut the start" but Kit has self-esteem issues and shuts it down
[2:52:48] <$Ziegsy> so like, was the reason their dimension was so fucked just pure bad luck that rivet and kit never partnered up?
[2:52:52] <BigCoffee> Where is emperor nefarious? We know the doctor took over, but where's the emp?
[2:52:55] <Saltmeisterr> oh no the morts
[2:52:56] <+SocialMisfitGamer> @Profmcstevie Well Rivet and Kit JUST met
[2:53:01] <ergulor> Monster
[2:53:04] <BigFingerRo> @toolofparanoia they're totally setting it up
[2:53:04] <%DianaTheAscian> that looks like a halo ship
[2:53:05] <RickyRelucent> But Pat both anywayy
[2:53:11] <%toolofparanoia> they are just Canadians
[2:53:13] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> He's sooo evil.
[2:53:13] <%sjay662> Lemonade is great
[2:53:21] <%asgard147> FUCK YOU I LOVE LEMONADE! limesHeck
[2:53:22] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Skelefellah I call this the Rise of Skywalker stage, that wasn't actually inspiration, right?
[2:53:22] <andrewofbob> Also, sweet and sour chinese food
[2:53:23] <BigFingerRo> Lemonade rules yeah
[2:53:24] <%ape_hawk> so does that mean nefarious doesnt like pineapple on pizza?
[2:53:24] <raikagelord1> Not the Morts.
[2:53:28] <RickyRelucent> depends what you call lemonade
[2:53:28] <%MidnightBurst12> 10/10 drink
[2:53:29] <BigCoffee> wtf paige doesn,t like lemonade?
[2:53:31] <$Ziegsy> american lemonade is a TRAVESTY FIZZY LEMONADE SUPREMACY
[2:53:32] <BigFingerRo> sour drinks are Top Tier
[2:53:34] <BigCoffee> but she loves sour shit
[2:53:35] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Ziegsy it's implied to be half that and half Nefarious being competent
[2:53:36] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Paige you suck
[2:53:37] <RickyRelucent> We talking ice water and lemons, or fanta
[2:53:40] <%toolofparanoia> yeah purple!
[2:53:42] <RetributionP> yellow accesorys
[2:53:42] <%Skelefellah> @ShinobiPhoenix Everything's derivative if you look deep enough~
[2:53:46] <%QueequegTheater> @ape_hawk he's got to be right some of the time
[2:53:53] <churropoppa> It has to be unsweetened SOUR ass lemonade.
[2:54:00] <%StaceMcGate> I'm not weak-uh
[2:54:04] <Ryanlupe> You're the best Pat :)
[2:54:06] <%RyTYoung> it's GOOD
[2:54:09] <%Skelefellah> YEYEYEYEYE THE LEVEL 5 FOR THIS WAS SO FUN TO WORK ON
[2:54:13] <RickyRelucent> y'all like agrumes
[2:54:15] <+SocialMisfitGamer> BLACK HOLE MINIGUN
[2:54:16] <RickyRelucent> :O
[2:54:19] <%cvp5127> this gun fucks
[2:54:24] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt THIS GUN IS GREAT
[2:54:27] <%Dakuu75> oh-fucking-sic. a litteral Mini-gun
[2:54:31] <%QueequegTheater> @Skelefellah was Ardolis based on any Sly Cooper levels, because it felt like Sly 1
[2:54:32] <%toolofparanoia> its a damn minigun!
[2:54:34] <KUYAmoPESh> Heavy machine gun
[2:54:36] <Profmcstevie> ....so no black hole doodSad
[2:54:43] <%AncelDeLambert> Black Hole Storm, won't you come, and wash the bots awayyyyy
[2:54:46] <%RyTYoung> I've platinumed the game before I got this to LV 10 omega and now I'm sad BibleThump
[2:54:49] <%ape_hawk> wheres the black hole?
[2:54:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ShinobiPhoenix oh I am definitely not saying it's a bad thing, just wondering if I was just crazy for seeing the Death Star Ships in the situation
[2:54:52] <andrewofbob> Minigun with spin-up and heat mechanic
[2:54:58] <%legendfather_of_giants> @QueequegTheater Ardolis is in earlier games, too
[2:55:05] <raikagelord1> I love Zim just Ziming it up.
[2:55:08] <RickyRelucent> @RyTYoung Play it again
[2:55:10] <%SolidusRex> Heavy Weapons Lombax
[2:55:10] <%pandapeeps> @Profmcstevie Breaks skateboard*
[2:55:12] <%StaceMcGate> dakka dakka dakka
[2:55:19] <%QueequegTheater> @legendfather_of_giants oh
[2:55:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> especially since you would have been making the game around the time the movie was released
[2:55:30] <%toolofparanoia> DAKKA DAKKA DAKKA DAKKA
[2:55:30] <%QueequegTheater> @legendfather_of_giants they might not knwo, but I bet it was
[2:55:32] <%Skelefellah> @QueequegTheater Ardolis was actually based on our older entries with the robo pirates! I can't say specifics other than it's something we've wanted to do for a LONG time.
[2:55:34] <%StaceMcGate> this robot needs to install some self-confidence drivers
[2:55:40] <%legendfather_of_giants> @QueequegTheater the PS3 ones, so it could still be one
[2:55:44] <%Skelefellah> What, noooooo
[2:55:47] <%RyTYoung> @rickyrelucent I think I will 100% complete it at some point, but I did a challenge run right after my first run to get all the trophies
[2:55:49] <%QueequegTheater> @Skelefellah that's cool
[2:55:50] <%Skelefellah> You're not even at the hard part yet
[2:55:51] <teefpal> what happened to old nefarious?
[2:55:52] <%Dakuu75> have you guys seen that youtube video of a dude dubbing guns with his own noises. then it ends with a mini-gun? lol
[2:55:57] <%Skelefellah> LUL
[2:56:08] <$Ziegsy> @Skelefellah I would Like to be your friend, and hear more stories of working on this and other games
[2:56:19] <%QueequegTheater> @Skelefellah you do realize your suffering makes him enjoy it more
[2:56:21] <RickyRelucent> I like going back and doing tons of runs with different rulings etc
[2:56:21] <StarMechV> that Mort was running in place
[2:56:22] <Saltmeisterr> @Dakuu75 link plz
[2:56:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I will say this stage fights fuck, it was intense and fun
[2:56:34] <%YakumoYomi> @Dakuu75 Well now I HAVE to see it
[2:56:41] <RickyRelucent> I loved nothing more then running deadspace just with a plasma cutter and a contact beam, for example
[2:56:42] <BigFingerRo> I don't like this weird not-accent the morks have
[2:56:42] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Help stepbro!
[2:56:43] <%Skelefellah> @QueequegTheater Oh man I've been following this dweeb since Machinima, I know his game LUL
[2:56:47] <%toolofparanoia> Oops all Morts
[2:57:00] <%Skelefellah> He hasn't seen the PROBLEM areas yet
[2:57:03] <raikagelord1> @teefpal probably just standing in the corner of Emperor Nefarious while he does the real work.
[2:57:18] <%ape_hawk> nooo, not condescending derision!
[2:57:26] <ididstuff666x> HOLY SHIT
[2:57:27] <%Skelefellah> @Ziegsy Hey fam, you do whatcha like, s'all good
[2:57:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yes, it's an orgy of fuck
[2:57:31] <%joodatious> Kreygasm
[2:57:33] <%topendbuzza> shit that fucks
[2:57:37] <%toolofparanoia> it fucks hard
[2:57:40] <+Buzzkill983> So many ways to MURDER
[2:57:55] <teefpal> It would have been a nice detail to add wilting grass or a fucked up skybox
[2:57:56] <%Monkeyweed21> HE'S TALLER
[2:58:22] <BigFingerRo> ban dr nefarious
[2:58:23] <%QueequegTheater> @RickyRelucent Plasma cutter only is legit one of the most viable ways to play the first playthrough
[2:58:24] <Saltmeisterr> BOOOO
[2:58:34] <BigCoffee> Oh did the nefariouses meet up too?
[2:58:37] <NickHatesSnow> I'm happy they get along
[2:58:46] <%toolofparanoia> God they're insufferable together
[2:58:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Skelefellah oh, since I can actually ask, what's with all the assets you can reach but they have nothing on them, so much of the map that leads no where and you can't escape without reloading the checkpoint
[2:58:47] <RetributionP> frizea and cooler
[2:58:49] <%Skelefellah> AND NOW THE PROBLEM AREAS START
[2:58:49] <%ape_hawk> with robotongues?
[2:58:51] <+Buzzkill983> The Oppressors must die! Down with GDI!
[2:58:57] <%joodatious> robo kisses
[2:58:58] <ididstuff666x> Emperor is less funny and therefore should die first
[2:58:58] <+vaderxyz1970> Well Ones a dom and ones a sub
[2:59:01] <%Monkeyweed21> why is Pat ignoring all the ammo boxes?
[2:59:02] <%toolofparanoia> worst power couple
[2:59:07] <andrewofbob> Rivet fights Ratchet's Nefarious, and then Ratched gets owned
[2:59:08] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt the only real difference is probably Emp's confidence, since our Nefarious was bullied by Quark in high school
[2:59:10] <%joodatious> down with the false gods
[2:59:11] <teefpal> they bond over shared interests
[2:59:14] <BigCoffee> Now I want to make lemonade, but with honey instead of white sugar
[2:59:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> this stage in particular, I got into 3 areas I couldn't escape from on the map
[2:59:16] <mephium> does the freeze also boost damage?
[2:59:21] <%QueequegTheater> Emperor is far less fuckable than Rivet IF YOU'RE A COWARD
[2:59:24] <%luftraumm1> don't let paige near those nefarious they are skeletons enough to jostle her
[2:59:25] <RickyRelucent> I know contact beam wasn't considered very meta, but i just loved making out charge speed first on that.
[2:59:37] <%toolofparanoia> Death to the False Emperor
[2:59:37] <RickyRelucent> Made hitting shots alot easier, less over correction
[2:59:42] <andrewofbob> Freeze has an upgrade for more damage
[2:59:44] <Profmcstevie> I wonder if the emperor went metal out of choice or had an incident like the dr
[2:59:47] <%Skelefellah> @ShinobiPhoenix That's something for a designer to answer I'm afraid hahaha I'm just a VFX Artist, and while I do care a lot about gameplay in what I make, I don't really have much control over layout hahaha
[2:59:52] <%shurtal> Twitter's fucked again!
[2:59:55] <mephium> oh I see

[3:00:33] <StarMechV> REMEMBER THIS WAS WITH NO CRUNCH
[3:00:33] <%QueequegTheater> @RickyRelucent for first time players it's legit better to just sell everything but the cutter so you can afford more upgrade nodes to up your health ASAP
[3:00:38] <%Dakuu75> and not a jpeg to be seen, anywhere
[3:00:39] <RickyRelucent> Most people just stuck to the force gun second fire tho
[3:00:40] <%StaceMcGate> nah I'm sure it was super simple, no one in chat can attest otherwise
[3:00:43] <%shurtal> @BigFingerRo But how will i know if paige ate poison, or broke something?
[3:00:46] <RickyRelucent> for the same effect
[3:00:49] <%Skelefellah> No one's got time for that, Pat. Crunch away~
[3:00:56] <%pandapeeps> Is he collecting energy drinks?
[3:00:59] <teefpal> Crazy that this was done wo crunch

[3:01:19] <JittersCaffeine> How long has it been since upgrading happened? There's been wuite a few level ups recently
[3:01:21] <mephium> yeah energy drink cosmetic for bolts
[3:01:32] <teefpal> uh oh

[3:02:09] <%shurtal> BORK
[3:02:09] <%HairballCT> i mean, you're still live so...
[3:02:10] <Sol_Install> yes
[3:02:12] <%Dakuu75> I was kinda expecting the stream to die, after Paige said that
[3:02:14] <andrewofbob> I dunno, are you LANning it up to Twitch?
[3:02:15] <%MelBrooksKA> No
[3:02:16] <BigFingerRo> it is

[3:02:20] <%Ranryu692> yes, but mine just stopped lol
[3:02:21] <%shurtal> @PatStaresAt yeah, but twitter's fucked up
[3:02:22] <Sol_Install> I can see the stream but i know what paige talking about

[3:02:37] <%Mattais88> Chuggs occasionally
[3:02:39] <%bhp_99> All is well
[3:02:47] <andrewofbob> Pat's void stream is on Wednesdays
[3:02:48] <%Skelefellah> This is a pre-recorded chat message
[3:02:48] <%bread_assassin> Could we see you if it weren't?
[3:02:49] <teefpal> Strange I can still see everything
[3:02:52] <Overloard> maybe because twitter is down she thinks internet is down LUL
[3:02:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @ShinobiPhoenix I definitely write the twitter account "sometimes"
[3:02:54] <akitanito> did it just flip the bird at you?
[3:02:54] <ididstuff666x> Chat is going through packet loss
[3:02:55] <%YakumoYomi> I don't know about your internet, but I can't seem to send you any brain messages
[3:02:57] <BigFingerRo> @rumtumtugnutz how'd you know to respond that huh? hah gottem facts and logit

[3:03:50] <%Skelefellah> SAVE NATURE PAT
[3:03:51] <JittersCaffeine> Those guys look like a LOT of experience
[3:04:06] <%MidnightBurst12> KILL EVERYTHING
[3:04:07] <%StaceMcGate> NATURE DIED
[3:04:08] <BigCoffee> Save the angry nature!
[3:04:12] <@commanderclaw> You need nature for dinosaurs tho
[3:04:13] <akitanito> save nature so you can destroy nature for more XP
[3:04:13] <JittersCaffeine> Think of it as ADVANCED Litters
[3:04:15] <RickyRelucent> save it just so u can fuck it up urself
[3:04:16] <%Skelefellah> Oh right nature's scary, nevermind.
[3:04:16] <%brisk_dacat> Nature boy Pat woohoo
[3:04:19] <teefpal> wow this part is actually challenging
[3:04:20] <andrewofbob> Kill the animals
[3:04:22] <Saltmeisterr> SAVE THE ANIMALS
[3:04:22] <%Tearonex> they killed it nvm
[3:04:22] <+MrWrann> Save nature to kill it yourself, more xp
[3:04:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> litter everywhere, but also you can't leave Earth: The Pat MO
[3:04:27] <%AncelDeLambert> oh well, nature is for nerds
[3:04:29] <%topendbuzza> you killed it anyway
[3:04:37] <%AncelDeLambert> We did it, Patrick, we saved the city
[3:04:39] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You see that Cosby's conviction got overturned
[3:04:39] <%Dakuu75> lotta Orange on this level
[3:04:50] <%Skelefellah> yeeeeeup
[3:04:55] <teefpal> Dont worry were gonna patch nature out next expansion pack
[3:05:04] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @QueequegTheater oh a technicality
[3:05:10] <%ShinobiPhoenix> on a^
[3:05:12] <StarMechV> GARY!
[3:05:12] <%Dakuu75> @teefpal lol
[3:05:25] <%Skelefellah> Don't worry aboot it
[3:05:28] <Overloard> brain time
[3:05:31] <RickyRelucent> can't nature just start a new save
[3:05:37] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt She's technically Clank
[3:05:38] <NickHatesSnow> It makes sense if you played the ps3 games
[3:05:49] <%Maids4lyfe> Maids4lyfe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months, currently on a 9 month streak! 25 months, wow.
[3:05:53] <teefpal> Thats neat how every playable character has an arc
[3:06:05] <lKaleidoscopel> thats how they get around it she already has training in this
[3:06:21] <%topendbuzza> right next to you
[3:06:21] <mephium> you can do it pat PogChamp
[3:06:21] <%QueequegTheater> @ShinobiPhoenix procedure is important. I hate it, but the courts essentially forced him to admit guilt under oath (gave up his 5th amendment right to remain silent) in exchange for a promise of not prosecuting
[3:06:22] <RickyRelucent> the wheel of autism
[3:06:23] <JonnyJug> Right
[3:06:24] <teefpal> What do you mean climate change wrecked my save file?
[3:06:24] <BigFingerRo> BOOST THAT SHIT
[3:06:25] <StarMechV> to your right pat
[3:06:27] <%luftraumm1> speen!

[3:06:28] <%Monkeyweed21> PAT
[3:06:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Skelefellah now I am curious if devs also follow the Youtuber rule of not reading comments or "reviews". now I am wondering how you guys felt about Dunkey's comments
[3:06:28] <%QueequegTheater> The accused have rights
[3:06:29] <Overloard> are they really gonna roll with rivet being a couterpart instead of her own person?
[3:06:40] <$Ziegsy> @RickyRelucent gross
[3:06:41] <mephium> pat can figure it out
[3:06:41] <Profmcstevie> Paige is alive, she diiid it

[3:07:12] <%Skelefellah> @Skelefellah Oh dude, criticism and reviews are fine - it's not our place to speak for the team is all. It's not like when we read a review we turn to dust hahaha
[3:07:21] <RickyRelucent> Kit and rivet come into their own
[3:07:24] <vVAstrAVv> blind
[3:07:26] <%brisk_dacat> Yay
[3:07:26] <akitanito> a "fast learner"
[3:07:28] <mephium> hurray PogChamp
[3:07:29] <RickyRelucent> their friendship is established differently
[3:07:30] <%Skelefellah> Big brain, Pat. You found the spinny thingy.
[3:07:30] <%QueequegTheater> @Skelefellah then perish
[3:07:36] <%QueequegTheater> Wait
[3:07:37] <%QueequegTheater> whoops
[3:07:50] <$Ziegsy> this galaxy effect on the characters is very pleasing

[3:08:29] <%Dakuu75> chat knows what's up
[3:08:29] <%Ranryu692> it IS a Western game after all
[3:08:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Skelefellah cool, it's something I am being told to be ok with as I get into game development myself, what criticism matters and what doesn't
[3:08:37] <%SaiyanShoto> Pat you’re engaged to the female version of you
[3:08:37] <%za7az> Wait, is it incest or masturbation?
[3:08:41] <ScreamLord> Is it incest or masturbation to fuck your dimensional clone?

[3:09:27] <mephium> you can do it PogChamp
[3:09:38] <%Dakuu75> look at that ZERO load time on death though
[3:09:39] <%Axellogic> The spinner
[3:09:39] <%joodatious> oh my god

[3:09:48] <%Monkeyweed21> why are you like this
[3:09:49] <%RyTYoung> uhh
[3:09:49] <%Faustgesicht> NotLikeThis
[3:09:49] <%Skelefellah> NICE
[3:09:53] <mephium> oh god the camera
[3:09:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I like just being in a chair and writing and learning to make things and get my work into form
[3:09:54] <%Axellogic> it spins
[3:09:56] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> PUZZLE GOD PAT

[3:10:17] <akitanito> yer a genius
[3:10:21] <mephium> he does it again PogChamp
[3:10:27] <%Skelefellah> This guy plays Lemmings.
[3:10:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> good job
[3:10:32] <ididstuff666x> HOW DOES HE DO IT
[3:10:40] <%MidnightBurst12> 1st try PogChamp
[3:10:41] <%Faustgesicht> sure
[3:10:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I forgot who it was that brought up Lemmings before
[3:10:52] <%Dakuu75> I don't mind when characters give you hints or reminds. But, i'm playing through KH3 atm and Donald'n Goofy NEVER STFU~!!!
[3:11:03] <%RyTYoung> Gary gets it
[3:11:21] <JittersCaffeine> They really don't seem to be handling the concept of predetermination very well
[3:11:24] <BigFingerRo> So hey, why's Rivet not want Kit ?
[3:11:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I rather like this puzzle
[3:11:31] <%Skelefellah> You have the light~
[3:11:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the solution is cute
[3:11:34] <%ape_hawk> @Dakuu75 donald voice: "this looks like a good place to find some in-gre-di-ents"
[3:11:42] <ididstuff666x> Boy it sure is good that Rivet met Clank or this duo chemistry with Kit would collapse
[3:11:42] <%CappuccinoGuil> Kit thinks it's destiny or something, but Gary is like "wait, THAT'S what you think this is?" I love it
[3:11:42] <Overloard> pat crazy talking again
[3:11:42] <$Ziegsy> @Dakuu75 I THINK I SEE SOME MORE INGREDIENTS
[3:11:43] <%Skelefellah> Time for the think tank to do work
[3:11:48] <%legendfather_of_giants> @BigFingerRo she's understandably not fond of robots and is a loner
[3:11:49] <RetributionP> small brain pat
[3:11:56] <mephium> rivet didn't properly meet kit like ratchet did I guess
[3:11:58] <%GarbageNirvana> @BigFingerRo Robophobia or something
[3:12:06] <RickyRelucent> think tank controls out of order
[3:12:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's weird to call a solution and formula "cute" but that's my personality
[3:12:09] <%Dakuu75> @ape_hawk @Ziegsy fuuuuuuck, NOOOOOOOO~! lol
[3:12:11] <RickyRelucent> he can't reach the panel
[3:12:19] <%greasypete00> is that a crocodile star platinum
[3:12:23] <no123450n> it's kinda weird that this kids game is also for adult fans
[3:12:28] <%za7az> @Dakuu75 "ThIS lOOkS lIkE a GoOd pLaCe tO fINd sOmE ingREdiENts!"
[3:12:29] <BigFingerRo> @BigFingerRo Oh I thought we had overcome that with Clank

[3:14:13] <+Buzzkill983> Kill em All, Rivet
[3:14:24] <vVAstrAVv> guys lets ditch pat and hang out with his sister
[3:14:33] <%RyTYoung> I tried to get into this area coming up early for the longest time LUL
[3:14:34] <raikagelord1> I like Ratchet and Clank so I will be here.
[3:14:52] <+megadblitz> why migrate to Paige when you can watch both streams simoultaniously
[3:15:01] <teefpal> Its funny hearing ppl want the "edgy ratchet" from the PS2 games and Im like "why?"
[3:15:03] <%Skelefellah> SPIN THE MINIGUN
[3:15:14] <%greasypete00> OH YEYEYE
[3:15:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Skelefellah I will also say I had wished it was easier to force a checkpoint, so I could leave the game when I needed to.
[3:15:22] <iosephe> MCH hell yeah
[3:15:25] <%StaceMcGate> this feels final level-ish
[3:15:25] <BigFingerRo> @teefpal because edgy is COOL and SCARY
[3:15:32] <%SolidusRex> Ratchet was only edgy in the first game
[3:15:47] <%RyTYoung> @stacemcgate It's building up to that
[3:15:57] <Profmcstevie> Ratchet was just an idiot in the first game
[3:15:58] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the game is still literally one of absolute best of the game, period
[3:16:07] <%Skelefellah> Go commit bullet kill
[3:16:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> year^
[3:16:16] <RickyRelucent> shoot a bigger gun
[3:16:28] <%asgard147> sounds good limesGun
[3:16:29] <+aj380> Ratchet in rac 1 was so cringy
[3:16:37] <Overloard> good thing theyre robots and not people
[3:16:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's literally a game I wished did have DLC to I could get more game
[3:16:46] <BigFingerRo> some people only specc'd into the edgy skill tree, so they want emo shit to make a comeback so their build is still relevant
[3:17:02] <%Dakuu75> did Pat max-out the fungi and glove of doom? is that why he's not using those? (jsut noticed no minions on screen)
[3:17:07] <mephium> dakka PogChamp
[3:17:14] <%RyTYoung> So far we've had P5 strikers, Returnal, Ratchet and Clank, Scarlet Nexus and so many more I've probably forgot, it's been insane
[3:17:17] <ididstuff666x> I have a slight impression Pat might like TF2 Heavy
[3:17:18] <JittersCaffeine> There's a surprising amount of neat crows control options in this game
[3:17:27] <%RyTYoung> Intergrade too
[3:17:31] <$SGrim> EXTERMINATUS
[3:17:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> games I WANT to give more money to for more content don't have a way for me to give more money
[3:17:33] <%Dakuu75> damn naruto, words
[3:17:34] <%topendbuzza> team rocket?
[3:17:38] <+SocialMisfitGamer> NARUTOOO
[3:17:40] <gslayer14> they're glassing the planet?
[3:17:41] <KUYAmoPESh> Panzer Dragoon
[3:17:46] <%DashXero> "Planetary Devastation" sound problematic.
[3:17:54] <%DashXero> *sounds
[3:17:55] <StarMechV> PAnzer freakin' Dragoon
[3:17:57] <%ape_hawk> wow, nefarious, youre just going for it, huh?
[3:18:08] <%RyTYoung> @shinobiphoenix I'm like that with Rift apart, I need MOAR
[3:18:13] <%greasypete00> does this play like og battlefront 2
[3:18:18] <+senfood> Lombussygard
[3:18:21] <%MrMegaJackpots> where is this in the nier lore
[3:18:28] <Overloard> i cant believe clemps is trying to destroy sargasso
[3:18:29] <%c00lbeans1999> c00lbeans1999 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:18:34] <%ape_hawk> thanks, space fargos!
[3:18:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @RyTYoung that's what I am talking about. I would actually have paid money for DLC with this
[3:18:40] <%RyTYoung> @mrmegajackpots The stage play I'm sure
[3:18:45] <%topendbuzza> we star wars now?
[3:18:49] <+MrWrann> If a couple of these cruisers can destroy a planet, why not just deploy them all around the planet not in one spot?
[3:18:51] <%toolofparanoia> is he trying to exterminatus the planet?
[3:18:57] <akitanito> that's a weakass shield
[3:18:57] <%CappuccinoGuil> Yeah, this looks like the part the dev mentioned was hard
[3:18:57] <%Dakuu75> Does Nefarious not have his own Death star? he jsut enjoys sending minions out? lol
[3:19:00] <+Buzzkill983> We fly now?
[3:19:02] <%CappuccinoGuil> LOOK AT THIS SHIT
[3:19:03] <%RyTYoung> @shinobiphoenix Even if it's more Zurkon arena missions that'd be fine for now
[3:19:04] <JittersCaffeine> Turns out, their shields don't like it
[3:19:11] <teefpal> I feel like the Emperor is riding that line between competent scary villian and kids show "we cant make the baddie too competent/smart"
[3:19:13] <BigCoffee> This is some star wars battle of endor shit
[3:19:39] <ScreamLord> I swear I've heard Emp Nefarious voice before
[3:19:47] <%toolofparanoia> oh he is trying to do an exterminatus
[3:19:48] <RickyRelucent> Nah you'll know when you got him
[3:19:51] <huskarl_zap> LAIR POG

[3:19:54] <%Skelefellah> Don't worry 'bout it
[3:19:54] <gslayer14> well that was convenient

[3:20:00] <+Buzzkill983> If I ever get a PS5, I know what I am getting
[3:20:01] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @Skelefellah the best compliment I can give is that I wish I could give you and the team more money for more of this
[3:20:02] <%RyTYoung> Did you fly Trudi earlier in the game @patstaresat ?
[3:20:05] <%ape_hawk> a better movie than rise of skywalker
[3:20:05] <%Dakuu75> because these devs knew wtf they were doing
[3:20:07] <%CappuccinoGuil> THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN MAKE WITH NO CRUNCH
[3:20:08] <%sjay662> @ScreamLord it's Rowan Atkin Downes (Kaz Miller, Travis Touchdown)
[3:20:13] <morningmoondude> NO CRUNCH, ALL COOL

[3:20:56] <JittersCaffeine> Man, a teleporting villain kind of sucks

[3:20:58] <morningmoondude> Emperor Nefarious probably has a huge robo dick
[3:21:03] <+MrWrann> Why didn't he do that earlier?
[3:21:03] <teefpal> Why doesnt the Emperor doesn't just kill Rivet?

[3:22:15] <%Mattais88> Makes sense
[3:22:17] <%Skelefellah> Nah not really LUL
[3:22:18] <JittersCaffeine> Building yourself a robot arm when you're down an arm is pretty impressive
[3:22:23] <BigCoffee> @teefpal clank is

[3:22:26] <BigCoffee> so ye

[3:22:30] <RickyRelucent> c :
[3:22:32] <intestinal_bleeding> that was the exposition dimension
[3:22:34] <NickHatesSnow> clank was a warbot too
[3:22:38] <%GarbageNirvana> But was she THE warbot
[3:22:39] <+zuzuxiv> meet at zurkies and get CRUNKED
[3:22:40] <Sol_Install> She did say it wasn't gonna slow her down

[3:22:50] <%topendbuzza> yes you were
[3:22:51] <%asgard147> limesYay LEMONADE FOR ALL!
[3:22:54] <RickyRelucent> Clank totally blew off ratchet's arm
[3:22:55] <%CappuccinoGuil> but was Clank capable of transforming into a giant warbot?
[3:23:04] <NickHatesSnow> Mort's Hard Lemonade
[3:23:07] <RickyRelucent> Also, Clank was "failed" warbot

[3:23:13] <%Dakuu75> @AthenaAegis if it was the hand, they'd actually be dead lol
[3:23:14] <Profmcstevie> Clank is a warbot, he transforms in the first games
[3:23:18] <RickyRelucent> he only got big on the quanto planet
[3:23:20] <mephium> clank did in one of the games
[3:23:22] <technical_tf> @CappuccinoGuil After a scientist gave him an upgrade in the first game
[3:23:28] <RickyRelucent> only on certain platforms
[3:23:30] <%legendfather_of_giants> @CappuccinoGuil yeah, there used to be "Giant Clank" levels. he just couldn't do it at will cuz he was defective
[3:23:35] <andrewofbob> Clank has that transformation (and ratchet swaps places and rides on Clank's back)
[3:23:36] <RickyRelucent> not on command
