[0:14:05] <DianaTheAscian> oof
[0:14:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> I actually played Kotor 2 before I even knew 1 existed. Great experience
[0:14:14] <%Promessa_EX> yeah windows 10 more or less makes reaaaly old stuff dificult
[0:14:19] <%DeadManProp> I've played KotOR 1 on GOG and had no problem with it @PatStaresAt
[0:14:20] <%slimmixrp> Mac version too
[0:14:21] <%mikessdd> It is. Very difficult. To get Kotor 1 working well on modern systems
[0:14:22] <%slimmixrp> Works well
[0:14:23] <ShichiNoBushi> "Coder 1"?
[0:14:24] <owazowski> KOTOR is our word, but you can use KOTA

[0:15:22] <XenoDandelion> maybe it means there are two knights

[0:15:25] <%cvp5127> sf starts at 2
[0:15:30] <bob900000> what!?
[0:15:30] <+zeraux_> that sounds correct
[0:15:31] <%MrPedrovsky> @patstaresat Jedi academy is 4 but it is the only action star wars

[0:15:39] <ShichiNoBushi> It could be like Final Fantasy and most numerical iterations have nothing to do with the previous ones.
[0:15:42] <+Over_ninek> damn it why is casting twitch to tv ass
[0:15:42] <MassConnect> but that was a joke
[0:15:43] <+Regigangster> If Street Fighter 2 is so good, why isn't there a Street Fighter 2 2?
[0:15:44] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Street Fighter 1 basically never happened lul
[0:15:45] <%Kirby_Sauce> Idk man, the two was in the background, behind the name. He could have thought it was a decal
[0:15:46] <%AzureGale> So street Fighter V would be a 5-player game
[0:15:46] <1matheuw> @Visorak6 that doesnt exist bro

[0:16:22] <mantraman97> Seriously, what does "It got old" mean for the PC version? what's better about the android/Xbox version?
[0:16:23] <bob900000> street fighter 1 ai is bullshit
[0:16:23] <%Ipsenscastle> Street Fighter 1 is a lie propagated by the karate industry
[0:16:24] <stfnotguilty> I remember a Sega Genesis game called "Test Drive 2: The Duel" I'm 100% there was never a Test Drive 1, and the game was made with a sequel name tacked onto it to seem like it was cooler than it was.
[0:16:25] <BluffRainbow> Kotor is back compatible on Xbox live so and as cheap as it is on steam last time I checked
[0:16:30] <%BoxNavy> @Kirby_Sauce he thought it was KOTOR II (eye eye)
[0:16:30] <+WizoSavage> again with the Wells
[0:16:31] <MassConnect> Star Wars being Star Wars maybe it's not surprising to think that it was just a government called Old Republic II

[0:31:29] <+DiOniFioni> reality is grey, that's why gta4 is the best gta
[0:31:31] <Coystick> Fallout the Pitt is Grey A+
[0:31:31] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Grey morality is dope in that it's actual good person morality most of the time
[0:31:38] <%Visorak6> Chaos World
[0:31:40] <Paciboyy> SMT doesn't have grey morality, lawful and chaotic are just both awful

[0:39:00] <%mikessdd> You are a Karen after all. Go full Karen.
[0:39:08] <Javi9563> if everybody hates you you still unlock their backstory and can make them a jedi, just be consistent
[0:39:17] <%Medrex> Pat please be a nice person. it's the right thing to do. for the children
[0:39:20] <DatAsuna> But also mical's voice actor is a huge mens rights weirdo
[0:39:21] <shadowboss89> Is pat on the other side?
[0:39:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> @DatAsuna Ewww no wonder he's a simp in this
[0:39:45] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Who has time for thinking when you have twitter to fester on
[0:39:55] <%Ipsenscastle> Kae'ryn's eyes are fucking terrifying
[0:39:56] <+chase959> big boy cyborg with no big boy words to say
[0:40:03] <+Soliloquy123> IIRC doesn't influence in this game work kinda like Dragon Age 2, where negative influence is still good or am I crazy
[0:40:07] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[0:40:09] <%AzureGale> HE STARTED IT
[0:40:10] <@SoFarFetched> "he started it!" LUL
[0:40:17] <%SirGO0SE> LUL

[0:40:27] <%Alazull> Yeyeyeyeyeye
[0:40:28] <JoshyJay> BIG JERK
[0:40:28] <%Aeoneth> Bring me solutions, not complaints is a very managerial Karen response
[0:40:30] <%troxvon_the_lesser> God this is perfect for Kay'ryn
[0:40:35] <%Alazull> Get it Darth Kae'ryn
[0:40:38] <%AzureGale> GET READY FOR THE NEXT BATTLE. Battle. battle.
[0:40:55] <%Alazull> Look at that face, that's a face that doesn't believe science
[0:40:58] <%Theycallmenerf> Drift? No Drip
[0:41:02] <%troxvon_the_lesser> I want your whole team to turn on you and become the heroes trying to defeat you
[0:41:04] <SaltyAzteca> @Alazull is that the canon name
[0:41:09] <MassConnect> this is the only one that actually matters
[0:41:18] <%Promessa_EX> i like your straight katana
[0:41:21] <%baka_sugoi> WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[0:41:23] <Javi9563> @Soliloquy123 exactly, but if they have low influence and you're dark side they will go light side and vice versa, but for the purpouse of unlocking conversations or making them jedi low influence unlocks that too
[0:41:24] <%Promessa_EX> there's proabbly a word for that
[0:41:25] <ape_hawk> JOHN WILLIAMS, NO
[0:41:26] <+KaijuUltimax> Yeah, fuck that contrarian witch
[0:41:27] <Coystick> Something about Kriea having a gun is realpy funny to me
[0:41:27] <%Alazull> @SaltyAzteca Pretty sure
[0:41:28] <+SilverDevilfish> PogChamp
[0:41:29] <%Xevtes> EVIL NOISES

[0:41:42] <%Alazull> Pat did you just do a little dance to the Dark Side stinger?
[0:41:43] <%Theycallmenerf> HOES MAD

[0:41:46] <Paciboyy> kreia's gonna be so pissed near the end, thats gonna be fun
[0:41:48] <%BoxNavy> jermaChomp
[0:41:54] <%Dunmarkh> @Promessa_EX it's a vibro mining katana
[0:41:54] <+canseesea> @Coystick arm the elderly and the blind, all at once!
[0:41:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nope.
[0:41:56] <%DeadManProp> I went for a bio-break, what epicness did I miss?
[0:41:58] <DatAsuna> No combat issue no
[0:41:59] <jtsoppy137> dont think so no
[0:42:03] <+Assaultpanda> don't think so
[0:42:03] <%SolidusRex> There are a ton of bonuses for influence
[0:42:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's a stun baton
[0:42:04] <ape_hawk> pat, you gonna watch the yak6 speedrun in a few hours?
[0:42:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> Wait, does this mean Darth Karen has reversed the Exile's canonical powers of magnetic personality?
[0:42:10] <%Medrex> Pat please. be nice to the old lady. she seems wise
[0:42:10] <%SirGO0SE> its for negotiation
[0:42:15] <%Puhff> Pat gonna get DMCAd for the level up stinger
[0:42:15] <subjectg> No issues in gameplay
[0:42:17] <laserbeaming> Nope, you can go full negative or full positive, it'll work
[0:42:17] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Well I mean they'll be bad at darkside shit
[0:42:19] <%mikessdd> That party members try to kill you at the end of kotor1 if you’re full darkside is pretty cool.
[0:42:23] <notsoy> it doesn't affect stats or anything like that, but there are lots of dialogue options that yield big XP/stat boosts but need high influence
[0:42:25] <jtsoppy137> Piss Blaster
[0:42:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> Thats one sexy gun
[0:42:26] <Daxalog> Did you do some offscreen grinding?
[0:42:28] <%BoxNavy> it looks like cold piss
[0:42:28] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpOmg psaBig GUN
[0:42:29] <LVL1_Scumbag> lukewarm piss
[0:42:29] <%Aydarkzero> PogChamp
[0:42:29] <%honeyman18> I mean doesn't it lock their story crap like their backstory
[0:42:30] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Yay!
[0:42:31] <%Ipsenscastle> lukewarm piss
[0:42:32] <+necrocannibal2> I piss like that sometimes
[0:42:34] <ape_hawk> it looks like pretty piss now
[0:42:36] <+b_aleph> it lloks like hot beer
[0:42:38] <+Assaultpanda> Your CHA helps your companions though
[0:42:40] <%GalacticLatte> GalacticLatte subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 15 month streak! 
[0:42:42] <+canseesea> It's crazy how many people love this game but didn't know you can go full negative influence for benefits
[0:42:44] <%Theycallmenerf> Big Piss
[0:42:51] <+canseesea> Game full of surprises
[0:42:52] <%Promessa_EX> why does the hilt on your ninjato go past the hilt
[0:42:54] <%luftraumm1> i cant avoid feeling that the glee you get with dark side choices almost justifies the first game's cartoonish tone
[0:42:58] <Javi9563> low influence also unlocks conversations, the point is being consistent with being a dick or a nice guy
[0:43:05] <+SilverDevilfish> Not so sneaky sneaky men PogChamp
[0:43:07] <%BoxNavy> is that just a regular ass sword?
[0:43:08] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Darth Kae'Ryn is a White Hole in the Force :)
[0:43:14] <%Puhff> Post the MOD L I S T !!!!
[0:43:16] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Zap!
[0:43:20] <laserbeaming> MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM
[0:43:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @canseesea There's been studies about this sort of thing. People generally play video games trying to make everyone like them and feel uncomfortable having their party dislike them.
[0:43:28] <mihokspawn> There is more of where that came from
[0:43:29] <%Puhff> I neeeeeed it
[0:43:31] <HairballCT> lytALRIGHT

[0:44:06] <%DemonOfSalt> 10/10
[0:44:07] <+necrocannibal2> fine
[0:44:08] <%cache_22> Audio is fine all around for me.
[0:44:08] <%troxvon_the_lesser> I min maxed the shit out of the influece stuff in Dragon Age and it felt great
[0:44:08] <%AzureGale> It was good
[0:44:11] <abelincoln_catpuncher> no ear rape here
[0:44:12] <%toolofparanoia> ALL GOOD
[0:44:12] <%Puhff> Fine
[0:44:13] <+b_aleph> loud and big
[0:44:13] <%SomeSageAdvice> seemed fine
[0:44:15] <%barrakuta371> Why dont jedi just use Force speed more?
[0:44:16] <laserbeaming> fine

[0:44:18] <%Nobrev> much good
[0:44:19] <%za7az> psaUp
[0:44:19] <Daxalog> Are my ears sensitive or are you talking louder than normal?
[0:44:21] <%Puhff> I guess
[0:44:21] <%VoidBaronJules> not death
[0:44:22] <%baka_sugoi> yeah

[0:44:28] <%DemonOfSalt> 10/10, would tweet Deep State conspiracy theories again
[0:44:29] <scrublordsamurai> hey pat if you want to maximize xp gain dont shoot anyone during the turret section
[0:44:29] <%BoxNavy> it was good
[0:44:34] <%AzureGale> @ape_hawk Gotta go for the full Karen look
[0:44:39] <%TinyLittleDancer> It had deep rolling bass with sparkly highs and a well defined midrange
[0:44:42] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt the sound is fine so far over all
[0:44:46] <%troxvon_the_lesser> It is perfect
[0:44:49] <%Promessa_EX> i think my issue might be the bitrate of the audio in game? it is old
[0:44:52] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @barrakuta371 cause the addiction is real, man. Jedi on their 4th day of a Force Speed bender is not a pretty sight
[0:44:53] <+b_aleph> PogChamp is online brb
[0:44:56] <ape_hawk> brrrrrrrrrrr
[0:45:08] <%Ipsenscastle> i mean its buzzing like fuck now but it seems intentional
[0:45:13] <+necrocannibal2> @tinylittledancer anthony fantano here
[0:45:32] <+SilverDevilfish> We only have 21 ships PogChamp
[0:45:40] <Huntercd> The Republic sucks

[0:46:11] <%Promessa_EX> i can see his eyeball cups
[0:46:16] <%troxvon_the_lesser> I never watch these all the way through so it's interesting to hear it
[0:46:37] <%Ipsenscastle> when are we gonna get to the fireworks factory?
[0:46:41] <carrion_king_> Just got here. Are we going evil or good?
[0:46:48] <ShichiNoBushi> Akbar: "It looks fine."
[0:47:00] <%Eaglestrike117> oh look its Darth
[0:47:07] <%Ipsenscastle> what's wrong with your faaaaaace?
[0:47:11] <%Puhff> Haha Carth dead
[0:47:15] <laserbeaming> I see Carth is dead. Good
[0:47:24] <+necrocannibal2> HIS EYES
[0:47:24] <thetruenicster> No Carth's Here
[0:47:28] <%Promessa_EX> yeah it sounds different
[0:47:35] <%troxvon_the_lesser> My friend thinks I'm a weirdo for playing games like this while listening to podcasts
[0:47:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> God I love HK
[0:47:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SMUG EVIL IS THE BEST
[0:48:01] <%Nobrev> 🦀 CARTH 🦀
[0:48:22] <thetruenicster> I SEE AI
[0:48:24] <laserbeaming> MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM
[0:48:26] <%Monkeyweed21> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:48:27] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Man fuck Carth
[0:48:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yaaaay
[0:48:36] <laserbeaming> good
[0:48:47] <%Blank9> atton is SO much better
[0:48:52] <+necrocannibal2> what is carth
[0:48:54] <ancrest_tant> Pat, what kind of settings are you using the compressor and limiter?
[0:48:55] <%Mr_Pylon> boring bitchy and whining is Carth
[0:48:55] <+SilverDevilfish> Yukiko syndrome
[0:48:57] <%Ipsenscastle> Carth is Kaiden is oatmeal
[0:48:58] <+Regigangster> Tell us how you really feel
[0:49:00] <+necrocannibal2> is he good evil or wjat
[0:49:03] <+necrocannibal2> what*
[0:49:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ATONN IS SO MUCH BETTER
[0:49:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> I kept Carth around to troll him and for the eye candy. Then when Bastila showed up he gotta go
[0:49:18] <%Alazull> Your worst sin Carth? You bore me.
[0:49:29] <Javi9563> atton at least has a personality
[0:49:30] <El_GhostV1> best thing about carth is that you can kill his son
[0:49:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Most of what makes Atton interesting is a spoiler.
[0:49:38] <jtsoppy137> like a brain tumor
[0:49:41] <%Puhff> Atonn is a great character
[0:49:41] <%Ipsenscastle> Kaiden at least has headaches he can whine about
[0:49:41] <thetruenicster> Which is funny cause they both have the same VA
[0:49:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> KAIDEN LUL LUL LUL
[0:49:51] <LVL1_Scumbag> Wait, Carth is worse than Kaiden?
[0:49:52] <olm46> A spaceist
[0:49:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah but Space Racism is funny
[0:49:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Atton is cool but you can't explain why early on
[0:49:57] <%GarbageNirvana> At least Kaiden killed that one guy
[0:49:58] <%Puhff> ASHLEY OMG
[0:49:58] <+necrocannibal2> I do
[0:50:03] <+Soliloquy123> Kaiden gets better in ME3 imo
[0:50:04] <%Xevtes> she gets less racist in 3
[0:50:07] <%Alazull> Hey she comes around
[0:50:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Kaiden has the personality of cardboard
[0:50:12] <%YakumoYomi> But she's hot, tho!
[0:50:13] <1matheuw> @El_GhostV1 even better: you can make HIM kill his son whilst you watch
[0:50:13] <%Xevtes> like they knew
[0:50:20] <+pally_din> LUL
[0:50:20] <StarlitStunner> Kaiden is a protagonist forced to play side character to Shepard
[0:50:21] <tattleworm> ashley became ash
[0:50:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ashley mellows out in 3 tho
[0:50:23] <%BTR_NOODLE> thanks for getting nuked Ashley :)
[0:50:24] <%coreyyotto> Kaiden X Kae'Ryn
[0:50:25] <Meekest> LOL
[0:50:25] <abelincoln_catpuncher> but Pat, she has tittieds
[0:50:25] <El_GhostV1> racist or boring who do you kill
[0:50:26] <%AzureGale> LUL
[0:50:26] <%Arkfyre> LUL
[0:50:27] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[0:50:27] <+Raiden_Breaker> LUL
[0:50:27] <Dragovus> Ash sucks. Why she gotta hate on all my cool alien friends
[0:50:27] <%Bt_Robot> Kaiden is all like MY MIND!!!
[0:50:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[0:50:31] <%barrakuta371> LUL
[0:50:32] <abelincoln_catpuncher> lfmao
[0:50:32] <%Nobrev> atton is at least kinda interesting. carth is just a blank slate soldier man who pretends to hit on fem revan
[0:50:32] <Javi9563> I mean she gets a lot better, that's her whole arc
[0:50:35] <abelincoln_catpuncher> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:50:37] <+Nohamforsam> All my homies hate ashley
[0:50:41] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Why are all the human party members in mass effect so fucking bad
[0:50:41] <%Xevtes> theyre both terrible
[0:50:42] <+Kurt_0> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:50:43] <%Ipsenscastle> The only people who save Ashley are blinded by her being the only sexable human female
[0:50:43] <%baka_sugoi> psaBig LUL
[0:50:44] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt that smear is still pretty racist.
[0:50:51] <+Kaiserzelcor> Fuck Ashley all my hommies hate Ashley
[0:50:55] <DatAsuna> Carth isn't a blank slate but yes he is boring
[0:50:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BIT BIG TITTOS THO
[0:50:59] <jtsoppy137> nani
[0:51:01] <%Undenizen> You don't understand Pat. She has a VERY tragic backstory. So she HAS to take it out on people who look different.
[0:51:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I think you have to move closer.
[0:51:02] <+b_aleph> kay, I PogChamp ed enough, back now
[0:51:08] <DatAsuna> Kaidan is a homie in ME3
[0:51:14] <DatAsuna> Mr canada man
[0:51:19] <tattleworm> on top of all that kaidan unlocks reave in me3 so he's the best choice
[0:51:20] <+canseesea> I saw that Policenauts playthrough, Pat has admitted he'd be space racist against space humans if they left earth intentionally
[0:51:21] <%Puhff> Even romancing Carth is boring
[0:51:28] <%Xevtes> @Ipsenscastle people who romance ash are also space racists
[0:51:31] <abelincoln_catpuncher> they tried dolling her up in MS3 and just ended up a lamer, less interesting Miranda
[0:51:34] <subjectg> it’s really a shame that the human party members in ME are also the most boring
[0:51:34] <DatAsuna> He's also way less agrro to you about the the cerberus stuff
[0:51:36] <%DeadManProp> Why do people like Wrex so much? Garrus and Legion for life CurseLit
[0:51:37] <+pally_din> Why would you even romance Carth
[0:51:44] <DatAsuna> Ash gets way more in your face about it
[0:51:45] <Broken_Sonex> @Ipsenscastle Hey man, I know I'm shallow for liker her just for her plump lips.
[0:51:49] <%Puhff> Carth's son is worse tho
[0:51:53] <+necrocannibal2> Wrex
[0:52:02] <reasonance> just heavy rain that shit
[0:52:04] <%Blank9> wrex is like "what if worf DIDN'T job?"
[0:52:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Shepard
[0:52:05] <DatAsuna> Andromeda continued that tradition by making Cora meh and Liam the WORST ONE YET
[0:52:06] <+Kurt_0> What
[0:52:07] <%YakumoYomi> @DeadManProp Because Krogans are rad.
[0:52:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pop quiz: What is Carth's son's name?
[0:52:21] <%Blank9> Barth
[0:52:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> Hmmm what if kill both Kaiden AND Ashley?
[0:52:25] <abelincoln_catpuncher> wrex is my bro how can you not love that ball of anger lol
[0:52:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> @too_much_nukie Is it Dumbass?
[0:52:30] <subjectg> Dustin Echoes
[0:52:31] <LVL1_Scumbag> Narc
[0:52:33] <%troxvon_the_lesser> I really wish you could romance Bastilla as both genders and tell Carth to go die
[0:52:33] <bloody0t> Darth?
[0:52:36] <abelincoln_catpuncher> @too_much_nukie dustil lmao
[0:52:39] <subjectg> because that’s all that’s left of em
[0:52:39] <+necrocannibal2> yeah Wrex is awesome
[0:52:43] <%Ipsenscastle> @DatAsuna i played the first hour of Andromeda and Liam's dialogue alone drove me away
[0:52:43] <%Nobrev> @Too_Much_Nukie trick question nobody cared enough to learn
[0:52:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @abelincoln_catpuncher You got it!
[0:52:53] <Sapphire_Breeze> monkaS
[0:53:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Too_Much_Nukie Easy, it was Shitpan
[0:53:15] <%Ipsenscastle> Wrex is awesome, Garrus and Legion are also awesome. They can all be awesome
[0:53:18] <%troxvon_the_lesser> The Carth chart is very accurate
[0:53:20] <%Nobrev> I thought that guys hat was a bad pompadour LUL
[0:53:21] <%MidnightBurst12> then who was ship?
[0:53:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Bastilla is a strong-willed female character who would never compromise her principles. Unless there was good dick.
[0:53:40] <Broken_Sonex> I always kill Kayden because Ashley's nice to look at.
[0:53:47] <subjectg> Reminder that Dustil shares the same VA with Rosh motherfucking Penin
[0:53:52] <jtsoppy137> Held together by pure hate
[0:53:57] <+arumz> fractured but whole
[0:54:00] <Pyrrhus90> too angry to die
[0:54:00] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Almost every character in Mass Effect who isn't human is great
[0:54:00] <+pally_din> haha fucking Rosh
[0:54:02] <%DeadManProp> @YakumoYomi I find Krogans to be one dimensional characters
[0:54:04] <olm46> Unusual
[0:54:06] <%Maids4lyfe> Ashley is a screaming karen
[0:54:10] <%AzureGale> Lamest scream evar
[0:54:13] <Coystick> A ZOMBIE??
[0:54:14] <Broken_Sonex> Never bring her with me on any mission tho
[0:54:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> "Fractured in several places"?! That man is made of dust! sbfpSetIn
[0:54:21] <%SolidusRex> I HAVE CUM FOR THE JEDI

[0:54:32] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Ashley totally is a Karen fuck
[0:54:40] <%Xevtes> @PatStaresAt do you think they will make Ashley less racist in the announced remake?

[0:54:52] <MassConnect> Nihilus?
[0:54:54] <ancrest_tant> Does this look like the Endire Spire or is that just me?
[0:55:01] <olm46> These sith are conceptually the best.
[0:55:04] <+b_aleph> like like uuuhhhh
[0:55:04] <%Maids4lyfe> Pockets!?
[0:55:07] <OldManDeckardCain> kreia's tier 3 sub is cooler? LUL
[0:55:08] <ancrest_tant> Endar
[0:55:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NIHLUS THO
[0:55:09] <TourettesPlays> use your big boy words pat
[0:55:09] <1matheuw> atris?
[0:55:11] <thetruenicster> Words, Pat
[0:55:12] <%Monkeyweed21> he's a lame mommy's boy
[0:55:24] <+arumz> cooler than count dooku
[0:55:26] <%Nobrev> you talk for a living pat
[0:55:28] <+hmgirlpopuri> I think it's supposed to be the same class of ship as the Endar Spire so they've got an excuse
[0:55:29] <+Kurt_0> Give me moar sith
[0:55:35] <%BoxNavy> that would NEVER happen
[0:55:42] <1matheuw> @Monkeyweed21 this answer is kinda cringe ngl
[0:55:43] <jtsoppy137> LUL
[0:55:43] <%Ranryu692> they'd be a hit at parties
[0:55:45] <+ThomasOfTroy> Rocket punch with flesh hand
[0:55:47] <%SolidusRex> "Your right hand comes off?"
[0:55:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's too cool and violent for the movies.
[0:55:47] <+b_aleph> sick
[0:55:47] <%Ipsenscastle> You want Star Wars Monsoon
[0:55:48] <%KeiganOfAstora> suuuuure
[0:55:50] <+chase959> be the change you want to see in the world
[0:55:50] <Sapphire_Breeze> so you want RE4 Salazar in Star Wars
[0:55:50] <%Aeoneth> You mean like Captain buggy from one Piece?
[0:55:50] <TourettesPlays> There's a [arty member in this game thats like that
[0:55:51] <%Promessa_EX> they could like rocket punch
[0:55:52] <%TinyLittleDancer> Like Knack?
[0:55:52] <%Seraphlul> I think there is a character that's done that in legends LuL
[0:55:52] <+canseesea> There was that weird tentacle monster in gendy's clone wars
[0:55:53] <Coystick> Why didn't Vader have a Rocket Punch
[0:55:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:55:56] <Broken_Sonex> @Xevtes No make her MORE racist. Make scream Karren noises at every alien in the game
[0:55:56] <olm46> The trick is to not attack the arms of the guy with stapled-together arms.
[0:55:57] <+hmgirlpopuri> What if they wore their own hand as a mask like the guy in MHA?
[0:55:57] <%KeiganOfAstora> smoke more weed?
[0:55:58] <Decahexa> PogChamp
[0:55:58] <%kozboz96> sith based buggy the clown
[0:55:58] <%Promessa_EX> actually it's just the stand metallica
[0:55:59] <LVL1_Scumbag> Wouldn't a prosthetic be more practical to that end?
[0:56:00] <1matheuw> i follow
[0:56:03] <%Puhff> Well theyre both Republic battleships
[0:56:04] <nzrai> pat...
[0:56:06] <%Ranryu692> why stop at just one lightsaber?
[0:56:08] <%Blank9> why not have lightsaber fin funnels??
[0:56:08] <Javi9563> I mean kreia does
[0:56:11] <DublinRage> So: Jedi Rocket PUNCH?!
[0:56:11] <%NovaKnightmare> KREIA DOES THAT PAT IN THIS GAME
[0:56:11] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Gee Pat it sure would be cool if a character did that IN THIS VERY GAME.
[0:56:13] <+necrocannibal2> but don't some characters do that
[0:56:14] <Noktifer> That uses a lot of energy
[0:56:14] <KeiPrime> thats just monsoon
[0:56:14] <%StaceMcGate> hmmmm
[0:56:14] <+chase959> that was a thing
[0:56:14] <subjectg> you say that...
[0:56:15] <%TheLemuroid> Pat...
[0:56:15] <%AzureGale> Someone probably does that
[0:56:15] <%BoxNavy> true
[0:56:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> Hmmm.....
[0:56:16] <jtsoppy137> cuz its hard
[0:56:18] <Sapphire_Breeze> it sure would
[0:56:18] <DatAsuna> Revan does round trip in SWTOR
[0:56:18] <%KeiganOfAstora> Because that uses too much mental power
[0:56:19] <+ThomasOfTroy> Have you beat this game?
[0:56:19] <%illtima> Gee Pat I wonder who does that
[0:56:20] <+Regigangster> Someone does that
[0:56:20] <ItsJustThatSimp_le> that's an actual thing
[0:56:20] <+hmgirlpopuri> Pat what if you just made a crossbow that shot lightsabers
[0:56:20] <ShichiNoBushi> Because that would be too cool.
[0:56:22] <%NovaKnightmare> or are you being facetious
[0:56:24] <s1rcuit> I've been thinking that for years
[0:56:24] <%shurtal> Why don't everyone in the world learn how to juggle
[0:56:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HMMMM
[0:56:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> Metnally exhausting
[0:56:25] <%GarbageNirvana> do you want a force-based rocket punch
[0:56:25] <+Raiden_Breaker> why don't you force their heart to blow up
[0:56:26] <Coystick> Why not just nukes?\
[0:56:26] <%Aeoneth> So Jedi Summon Swords?
[0:56:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Hmmm
[0:56:27] <Yakobro> LUL
[0:56:28] <%StaceMcGate> that joke wooshed over some peoples heads

[0:56:29] <LVL1_Scumbag> Do you tho?
[0:56:29] <%coreyyotto> no u
[0:56:30] <%Gogogolem> precise control is really hard.
[0:56:30] <Pyrrhus90> thats the joke chat LUL
[0:56:31] <1matheuw> i hope we see something like that in vidya games
[0:56:31] <%AzureGale> LUL
[0:56:31] <%rekinom> Why not have some sort of way to shoot light sabers at your enemy from a distance
[0:56:31] <%GarbageNirvana> is that what that is
[0:56:33] <%Puhff> Cuz that's hard af lol
[0:56:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DO YOU THO?
[0:56:34] <Sapphire_Breeze> ...

[0:56:49] <%KeiganOfAstora> Paaaaat-uh
[0:56:50] <%Gogogolem> It would be more effective to just crush their brains with you push powers.
[0:56:53] <DatAsuna> @Aeoneth in swtor, revan actually uses it as round trip instead lol
[0:56:53] <nzrai> Pat...

[0:57:13] <mihokspawn> @PatStaresAt have you heard of jedi fast travel: Jedi A uses force push on Jedi B, and Jedi B uses pull on Jedi A.
[0:57:13] <%Undenizen> perhaps one day, once technology advances, they can put lightsaber technology as a projectile from some sort of mechanized crossbow
[0:57:15] <%Bt_Robot> OH NO, PAT IS TALKING ABOUT GRIEVOUS AGAIN
[0:57:15] <olm46> Feet.
[0:57:21] <%SirGO0SE> vineYes

[1:02:48] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Any idea what lightsaber color you're gonna go for, cause basic red is for edge boy losers
[1:02:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah the saving throw cuts damage in half. If they didn't save it would be killing them outright.
[1:02:55] <subjectg> If you wanna see the nitty gritty of combat, there’s a menu for that @patstaresat
[1:02:55] <OldManDeckardCain> UNLIMITED DRIP
[1:02:57] <%umbypokochan> is this the zapping system?
[1:02:58] <%shruke> Is the saving throw for more damage or a stun?

[1:04:06] <+Soliloquy123> haha why does she have that i wonder haha
[1:04:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> Well yeah b/c she a Consular they dont get feats
[1:04:08] <%VoidBaronJules> @subjectg Noice
[1:04:09] <+Spoonsire> Lightning is kinda busted in 2, the damage wasn't capped or something so proper specs allowed you to kill most anything with a few casts
[1:04:11] <+b_aleph> it is funny
[1:04:14] <TheRadIdeaMan> "Well I mean I've only got the one so...."
[1:04:17] <+b_aleph> Im laughing out loud
[1:04:20] <+b_aleph> hahahahahaha
[1:04:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> She can't even get two-weapon fighting.
[1:04:21] <ShichiNoBushi> It's as if she's foreseen something.
[1:04:21] <subjectg> Notice you can’t actually take the feat you’re looking for
[1:04:22] <+cdrom321> Give her two-handed.
[1:04:24] <%SirGO0SE> oh my, such smelly feets you have
[1:04:24] <Conky89> Blasters are at least worth a damn unlike the first game.
[1:04:24] <+b_aleph> So funny
[1:04:27] <Paciboyy> heal duh
[1:04:43] <%baka_sugoi> FEETSIES
[1:04:56] <%Ipsenscastle> remember how Wynne was basically a required party member in Dragon Age Origins and it sucked
[1:05:02] <jtsoppy137> Buff
[1:05:06] <rsg220> I assume this is a dark side run?
[1:05:07] <Paciboyy> funny to have the conflict obsessed grandma just have support power
[1:05:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That fits the lore.

[1:05:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You mean Reaver not Berserker.
[1:05:39] <%Ranryu692> would you ever stream DA:O?
[1:05:41] <lambishly> That first game was good too bad about the rest of DA LUL
[1:05:41] <%Monkeyweed21> blood magic knight was the SHIT
[1:05:41] <tattleworm> that stuff was an account unlock, you could just reload after getting it
[1:05:42] <%cylish> Oh Fuck I forgot that classes were locked behind character deaths
[1:05:44] <Kiraklene> Dragon age oregano
[1:05:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> Wow you killed Leliana? Must've been going for the big evil
[1:05:45] <%justcallmebobplease> Is there any Dragon Age character more fun to interact with than the homocidal golem in the first game?
[1:05:52] <%Blank9> no one wants to play as a healer as the main character
[1:05:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You could've just saved after getting the class then loaded the save too lol
[1:05:57] <subjectg> Jokes on you because reaver kind of sucked anyway
[1:05:58] <huskarl_zap> You dont need them dead to get berserker
[1:05:59] <+Kurt_0> Don’t do it pat
[1:06:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah that's Reaver.
[1:06:02] <Yakobro> coward

[1:06:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> But the Dragon Glory tho
[1:06:19] <%Monkeyweed21> BLOOD MAGE FOR LIFE
[1:06:24] <%GreGHWiggy> GreGHWiggy subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[1:06:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Dragon Age Origins is a good game mate.
[1:06:29] <huskarl_zap> reaver sucks tho
[1:06:30] <Javi9563> pretty much one of the best rpgs of all time, pretty alright
[1:06:31] <subjectg> I had to cheese that dragon super hard with Shale
[1:06:31] <%captain_thickthighs> those golems were pretty metal
[1:06:31] <Coystick> I really need to play Origins
[1:06:34] <ShichiNoBushi> If you pee in the Holy Grail, does it make it holy urine?
[1:06:36] <StarlitStunner> Reavers drink dragon juice to gain big strong
[1:06:36] <lambishly> 3 is really bland
[1:06:40] <OldManDeckardCain> 3 was meh
[1:06:40] <MassConnect> what about Andromeda?
[1:06:42] <fuji_92> second is good tho
[1:06:43] <tattleworm> da2's friendship/rivalry system's cool as hell and it sucks it's stuck in da2
[1:06:46] <LVL1_Scumbag> Bioware really went downhill, didn't they?
[1:06:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> I just realized the Dragon Age tie-in flash game is dead
[1:06:51] <+ThomasOfTroy> I couldn't play more than a few hours of 3
[1:06:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> DA 2 is like if DA 1 went to Rehab after a 12 week meth bender
[1:06:53] <+bear_breaker20> DAo is a classic
[1:06:55] <ape_hawk> 3 had Iron Bull in it, so its good in my book
[1:06:57] <Broken_Sonex> DA 2 is not bad, it's boring, which is way fucking worse.
[1:06:58] <%Monkeyweed21> 2 would be good if they got more than a year to make it
[1:07:00] <%Puhff> 3 was JUST aight
[1:07:00] <+Kurt_0> They should remaster origins just cause
[1:07:05] <alroy900> i really liked origins, but the 2 others kinda sucked
[1:07:05] <+vaderxyz1970> Still at Peragus?
[1:07:07] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Ehh Dragon Age 2 is bad, but I had fun with it
[1:07:08] <Coystick> Wasn't Origins the last universally beloved Bioware game?
[1:07:12] <SilverFeng> 3 was alright but too much mmo style stuff
[1:07:14] <MassConnect> what about Jade Empire?
[1:07:15] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat, if Zangief's so heavy, are you growing more powerful everytime you lift him off Paige?
[1:07:16] <lambishly> I should re play DA:O
[1:07:17] <%Monkeyweed21> DA2 had less dev time than Kotor 2 btw
[1:07:18] <%Ipsenscastle> 2 is half an excellent game glued together with spit and leaves
[1:07:22] <%DeadManProp> First Dragon Age has a surprisingly tough last boss compared to other BioWare games
[1:07:30] <Conky89> Eh, I thought Templar was the class to go for soldiers. Makes mage enemies irrelevant.
[1:07:35] <ShichiNoBushi> 5 / 10 < 1 / 10
[1:07:39] <+Kurt_0> 2 feels like me2 in dragon age
[1:07:41] <%za7az> Mandaborian, coming this summer
[1:07:46] <+kraftium> PogChamp
[1:07:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> lol
[1:07:47] <olm46> DA2 is like half a game
[1:07:52] <Coystick> Jade Empire was fucking awesome Closed Fist threesome fo' life
[1:07:53] <tattleworm> 12 months if i remember right, totally insane
[1:07:53] <+cdrom321> 3 years vs 14 months.
[1:07:58] <subjectg> Dragon Age 1 final boss was just a resource sink
[1:07:58] <%Monkeyweed21> it was a little under 12 months iirc
[1:08:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Get that stupid armband.
[1:08:05] <%PauliusMaximus> they were also making an mmo and me3 at the same time
[1:08:06] <%GarbageNirvana> I think you had like 10 environments in that game tops
[1:08:20] <Conky89> One city. The whole game takes place in ONE city and nothing of value happens till the last third of the story...
[1:08:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Damn, I'm an hour late and we're still on Paragus
[1:08:28] <+bear_breaker20> @subjectg it had mechanics like the ballista
[1:08:28] <lambishly> was DA:O the last good bioware rpg?
[1:08:34] <DeadManProp> @Coystick Jade Empire is a legit classic
[1:08:37] <TrollKing96> So the lesson here is if you succeed the first time, quit while you're ahead.
[1:08:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I hate this armband because it's not even that good but it stays on my character the whole game anyway because it's just a free point in CON.
[1:08:42] <jtsoppy137> LUL
[1:08:42] <olm46> It'd be cool if the city was neat.
[1:08:42] <Paciboyy> what kind of karen willingly takes injections?
[1:08:45] <+Assaultpanda> tunneler
[1:08:50] <Big_Dream> @PatStaresAt you know the plasma toech can open anything right
[1:08:51] <+Kurt_0> Dragon age games tent do have pretty bad endings
[1:08:51] <thelonechris> Get out of the way
[1:08:52] <%Dunmarkh> MISS
[1:08:53] <%Czar_Kazem> miss
[1:08:58] <Pillagius> Aton like "dude, what are you doing?"
[1:09:00] <Big_Dream> @PatStaresAt you know the plasma torch can open anything right
[1:09:00] <+Assaultpanda> Use a security spike
[1:09:01] <Coystick> You should play Bound By Flame, absolute jank imitation Bioware RPG with a completely off the wall bullshit asshole final boss
[1:09:03] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean Inquisition was okay
[1:09:06] <ShichiNoBushi> How high do they expect your Skill to be at at this point in the game? Do you have access to Security Spikes?
[1:09:09] <%za7az> Almost like you're trying to cut down a metal door with a sword
[1:09:09] <subjectg> @bear_breaker20 i guess, but actually hitting the thing was not very fun for melee
[1:09:10] <Yakobro> how do you miss a door
[1:09:14] <%AzureGale> First try!
[1:09:17] <%justcallmebobplease> That's right Atton
[1:09:20] <SilverFeng> me2 came out after da1
[1:09:20] <%Ipsenscastle> Shivs can open anything
[1:09:20] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Man I wish Kotor 1 and 2 didn't have these long as first areas/tutorials
[1:09:23] <%justcallmebobplease> Stare, awkwardly, at her shitty door-breaking
[1:09:28] <%justcallmebobplease> Karen deserves to be stared at
[1:09:28] <%GarbageNirvana> Inquisition actually gets a lot better if you download a mod to fix the AI bugs
[1:09:30] <bloody0t> @Yakobro You run past it
[1:09:32] <%Monkeyweed21> more like super power shield
[1:09:33] <%Blank9> for the future
[1:09:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Remember that if you use Force Valor it boosts attributes and can help you pass skill checks like locked containers.
[1:09:34] <%baka_sugoi> ASS
[1:09:34] <%Big_Dream> Big_Dream subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! 
[1:09:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> assassino
[1:09:41] <subjectg> You can actually check the DC of security doors in the logs @patstaresat
[1:09:44] <notenoughgirls> MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM
[1:09:49] <%GreGHWiggy> didnt some dev admit that it basically pure luck that DA3 didnt turn out a complete shit show like Andromeda? seem to recall something like that
[1:09:51] <%AzureGale> ASSASSINO
[1:09:52] <1matheuw> donde esta?
[1:09:53] <KaiserMario> Give him the succ
[1:09:54] <conwaybearkiller> !TSLRCM
[1:10:01] <%Alazull> Kreia what the hell?
[1:10:08] <1matheuw> detrás de ti imbécile
[1:10:09] <%troxvon_the_lesser> I wish Dragon Age Inquisition didn't have all the padding and bloat
[1:10:10] <conwaybearkiller> what is the RCM part?
[1:10:10] <%VoidBaronJules> is she gonna donald the heals
[1:10:11] <ShichiNoBushi> "ASSASSIN!!" [commercial break] "For the future!"
[1:10:12] <olm46> The battle never ends, exile.
[1:10:14] <Coystick> Buffing you after the fact is Grey AF
[1:10:19] <%GarbageNirvana> Andromeda didn't have the leadership that Inquisition had and so when they needed to come through in the clutch they just ended up floundering
[1:10:25] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's kind of cute this ship is named the harbinger.
[1:10:29] <%baka_sugoi> SPOOC ASS ASS I NZ
[1:10:30] <%GarbageNirvana> which as it turns out is how most BioWare games ended up getting made anyway
[1:10:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Considering its function in the story.
[1:10:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> I wish inquisition didn't look like a goddamn greased up nightmare
[1:10:35] <%Garthunox> FOR THE FUTURE!
[1:10:43] <%RetroCop87> kreia is the donald of star wars
[1:11:08] <%GarbageNirvana> basically the moment Casey Hudson left everything went to shit
[1:11:12] <1matheuw> get yourself some drugs
[1:11:13] <Paciboyy> That survived alright
[1:11:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> hey, Inquisition has best boy Cole tho
[1:11:25] <%Ipsenscastle> @GarbageQueenEllie did you make the mistake of putting the lip glossiness slider up from zero and blinding yourself?
[1:11:26] <+Kurt_0> I wish inquisition was fun to play
[1:11:47] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah...
[1:11:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Ipsenscastle Bruh I couldn't even run the demo without my pc having a stroke
[1:12:04] <%baka_sugoi> space drugs PogChamp
[1:12:06] <subjectg> @ipsenscastle man do i hate when character creators do not reflect what you look like in game
[1:12:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Sphincter_Spelunker Cole is the kind of guy who talks about chivalry at the bar then goes home and beats his wife.
[1:12:38] <+projectmanatees> So Karen got better sleep then pat
[1:12:42] <%Ipsenscastle> @subjectg that game is like the worst offender for that. Lots of pasty slimy motherfuckers
[1:12:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Too_Much_Nukie ? Do you mean Cullen? Cole was the literal child
[1:12:55] <ape_hawk> god, her eyes
[1:13:00] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Man too angry to die
[1:13:00] <ape_hawk> she looks EXHAUSTED
[1:13:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah I meant Cullen, woops.
[1:13:05] <Coystick> Cenobite shit
[1:13:07] <rsg220> perhaps that fissure rife evilest looking sith lord in the tank is responsible
[1:13:09] <%shurtal> Is this dude just Shadwo from that one comic?
[1:13:13] <SilverFeng> HATE
[1:13:13] <%MrPedrovsky> Does that mean Sith Assasisns watched her shower?
[1:13:17] <Huntercd> Do you get naked to heal in pod? @PatStaresAt
[1:13:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Cullen just needs a hug
[1:13:21] <+projectmanatees> Man too angry to die
[1:13:21] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Through the force all things are possible.
[1:13:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> and therapy
[1:13:34] <KaiserMario> With all the negative press EA gets by making shitty SW games, I wonder why they never tried to remakes these two... Seems like a sure bet...
[1:13:36] <+megaman_sentinel> nano machines
[1:13:42] <1matheuw> that looks kinda like pocketz
[1:13:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Kolto can go through clothes but you need to wear something thin and breathable.
[1:13:49] <1matheuw> except for the eyes ofc
[1:13:51] <LVL1_Scumbag> Why do the sith always gotta be so butthurt?
[1:13:55] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpSetIn oh no
[1:13:57] <TheRadIdeaMan> "Man this dude was FUCKED"
[1:14:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That's why your character wears their weird underwear.
[1:14:03] <OldManDeckardCain> oh hey, it's kreia's tier 3 sub LUL
[1:14:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> yea he ded
[1:14:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh no
[1:14:12] <1matheuw> the dude is made from crumbled crackers
[1:14:13] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Because anger leads to the Dark Side
[1:14:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I've come for the jedi
[1:14:18] <Conky89> KOTOR with DLC that gives paid for level ups... *shudders*
[1:14:18] <%Ipsenscastle> That dude needs sanding down
[1:14:19] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Especially manbaby tantrums
[1:14:23] <ape_hawk> its capn crunch!
[1:14:24] <subjectg> @oldmandeckardcain it’s YOUR tier 3 sub
[1:14:25] <danpc5> too angry to die
[1:14:25] <%baka_sugoi> D R U G S
[1:14:26] <%GarbageNirvana> my guess is anything EA does with Star wars now has to go through Disney first just to make sure they're not conflicting with whatever internal narrative they've got going
[1:14:28] <%honeyman18> I would shit my pants if I was that dude
[1:14:29] <olm46> Light side looking pretty dumb right about now.
[1:14:30] <%DakotaMacDoodle> The Sith of Spite

[1:14:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Just change them up frequently then.

[1:15:00] <%Alazull> Mira and Mandalore
[1:15:02] <mihokspawn> Mandalore and HK
[1:15:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> Bring Mira and Visas so they can make out in the background during dialogue cutscenes
[1:15:03] <ape_hawk> YOURE not very hard!
[1:15:04] <+IJspegels> Yeah, the bender-bot
[1:15:04] <+Soliloquy123> I don't think this game has a party member I outright dislike.
[1:15:05] <slix3431> Pat did you hear they finally caught Florida man?
[1:15:05] <Paciboyy> and mandalore's super out of place in this game
[1:15:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Do what I do and role with a different crew for every planet.
[1:15:11] <+cdrom321> V-Souce
[1:15:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @GarbageQueenEllie nice
[1:15:19] <mihokspawn> @Paciboyy ????
[1:15:20] <slix3431> They arrested him at the Capitol
[1:15:22] <KaiserMario> He gives me certain "Metal Gear" boss vibe... Something like Gray Fox and Volgin. I really like him
[1:15:26] <Javi9563> pat can't get mira, he's going dark side
[1:15:32] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Evil is forced on you if you are Angry in the Star Wars universe because fuck god is also satan
[1:15:32] <OldManDeckardCain> they catch florida man daily, he just escapes
[1:15:33] <+projectmanatees> Do people like mira?
[1:15:40] <%DakotaMacDoodle> there are more Flordia men out there
[1:15:43] <+Kurt_0> Oh shit
[1:15:48] <mihokspawn> @projectmanatees in general no
[1:15:50] <%Ipsenscastle> Florida Man is the true opposite of Batman
[1:15:52] <Zebroneath> Also, less influence all around
[1:15:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt You could just grind up offscreen to max level using the mine glitch
[1:15:58] <%SirGO0SE> yeah I kind of wish this game was a little more...adversarial?
[1:16:02] <ManfredA> party members are just flavor after a certain level
[1:16:04] <%DeadManProp> Is Florida man the one with bison horns on his head and American flag on his face?
[1:16:06] <%Blank9> the levels scale in exp requirements though, so 80% of a level 20 character is probably level 19 anyway
[1:16:11] <Paciboyy> @mihokspawn he doesnt have a place in this story, just during dxun and onderon
[1:16:15] <%SirGO0SE> like, there isnt really any combat puzzles ever
[1:16:26] <slix3431> @DeadManProp He isn't weird enough to be Florida man
[1:16:27] <%Monkeyweed21> @DeadManProp no thats the Q shaman
[1:16:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> too cool
[1:16:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> D:
[1:16:39] <+Kurt_0> Yeah
[1:16:40] <%AzureGale> Is there also a character named Ian
[1:16:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> yeah and?
[1:16:43] <Pyrrhus90> hes too cool
[1:16:50] <Paciboyy> Its fun during onderon
[1:16:57] <ManfredA> he's more interesting in a LS playthrough
[1:16:57] <subjectg> If there’s something I’ll give to Kotor 1 over 2 is that it had way better encounter design
[1:17:00] <KaiserMario> Actually, now that I think about it a little bit... Colonel Volgin is just a Sith, isn't he?
[1:17:03] <tattleworm> because mandos are kinda central to your character?
[1:17:03] <+Kurt_0> I ain’t saying no to cando the mando
[1:17:05] <rsg220> cause revan was like it'd be sick
[1:17:07] <%Alazull> Because you might get him to Revan
[1:17:10] <Coystick> For me it's Kriea and HK
[1:17:10] <%Blank9> influencing atton to be EVIL is fun
[1:17:10] <%DeadManProp> @Monkeyweed21 The Q shaman, right. Pardon me lol
[1:17:18] <%Ipsenscastle> Remember when Mass Effect 2 just had Canderous again in that DLC?
[1:17:24] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Cause Revan told him too Probs
[1:17:25] <SilverFeng> mandalore's supposed to be not psychotic evil isnt he?
[1:17:25] <mihokspawn> @Paciboyy Dunno I found him more interesting in this one than 1, with the quest around the galaxy to gather the Mandalorians
[1:17:38] <rsg220> mandalore is lawful evil
[1:17:45] <%Bt_Robot> This is the way.
[1:17:46] <Pillagius> Accidentaly...
[1:17:46] <%bread_assassin> Hanharr is pretty good.
[1:17:54] <%toolofparanoia> Canderous/Mandalore rules
[1:18:14] <Javi9563> hanharr can give you a pretty big boost and it's a cool conversation with kreia if you fuck him up
[1:18:16] <DatAsuna> I like zaeed but he's no canderous
[1:18:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I liked the Mass Effect Canderus in the horde mode of 3. The omnibow was fun
[1:18:29] <+BigCoffee> BigCoffee subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! Thanks for being the fun ginger lump during the shit show last year and this year too!
[1:18:30] <%Ancopro> ohno
[1:18:32] <%baka_sugoi> DA PEE PO
[1:18:33] <GarbageQueenEllie> If Pat hates Carth for being boring, I wonder what he thinks of Disciple.
[1:18:33] <%Ipsenscastle> What was Mass Effect 2 Canderous even called? I just remember him as Canderous 2
[1:18:34] <+pally_din> Hey that's me
[1:18:34] <Huntercd> HK? Human killer?
[1:18:34] <%Bt_Robot> A Mandalorian will follow anyone if they promise a good combat.
[1:18:36] <%MrPedrovsky> @patstaresat Why doesnt everyone know that HK is Hunter Killer model for sale for work?
[1:18:37] <+Kurt_0> That’s us
[1:18:38] <Zebroneath> that sounds danerous
[1:18:38] <MassConnect> by chat do you mean money?
[1:18:40] <%Too_Much_Nukie> YABAI
[1:18:40] <DatAsuna> I say use no party members
[1:18:42] <%king_wragles> First party decision: pet elmo
[1:18:44] <DatAsuna> solo the game
[1:18:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Hunter Killer

[1:19:13] <%Ipsenscastle> that was quick
[1:19:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The game has sensed what is in your heart Pat and it found the dark side.
[1:19:17] <+Kurt_0> Dark jedi is best jedi
[1:19:19] <%troxvon_the_lesser> LUL

[1:19:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Or ribbons that go crazy.
[1:19:52] <%mikessdd> the random nature of the loot makes repeat playthroughs more interesting at least
[1:19:54] <%Bt_Robot> The rise of Darth Karen

[1:29:44] <dinnydanny777> T3 is a Sith Lord.

[1:29:50] <+Kurt_0> Droids don’t have free will do they
[1:29:56] <s1rcuit> @BulbasaursCry because no one taught them to emotion properly
[1:29:58] <%Ipsenscastle> T3 is basically a photocopier on treads
[1:29:59] <nzrai> this droid is for headpats
[1:30:00] <SilverFeng> t3 is deviant
[1:30:08] <dinnydanny777> T3 is the manager of KOTOR2.
[1:30:09] <Coystick> Darth T3, the 3 Ts are Terrify, Tyrant, and Torture!
[1:30:14] <%Blank9> Do you get like, 1 per level?
[1:30:14] <%threeheadedwalrus> is karen pro-droid?
[1:30:30] <%Undenizen> DROIDS ARE TOOLS.
[1:30:31] <s1rcuit> @Coystick nice
[1:30:33] <%mikessdd> T3 is the goat
[1:30:37] <%toolofparanoia> No, droid is for kicking. It is just a magic trashcan
[1:30:38] <MassConnect> if you don't have X, he gives you up to X
[1:30:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> Wait, so Droids can't feel the Force, but the Force can feel Droids, so are they alive or what
[1:31:00] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I got into investing recently, i'm mad i didn't start 10 years ago. would be stupid rich
[1:31:07] <Coystick> @GarbageQueenEllie yes
[1:31:07] <mgotacon> I wonder why....

[1:31:12] <%xcompleasedad> Why?
[1:31:12] <%SirGO0SE> DansGame
[1:31:13] <nzrai> I actually love him and am unable to hate him
[1:31:14] <%Undenizen> @GarbageQueenEllie droids are canonically invisible to the force.
[1:31:18] <krin_x> karen is pro anything that can make a pumpkin spice latte
[1:31:19] <%illtima> He's a robot what the hell
[1:31:20] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Droids are weak
[1:31:20] <%chiazam> wow fuck you pat
[1:31:20] <subjectg> @garbagequeenellie i don’t think that’s true, since kreia can’t sense them
[1:31:20] <%Ranryu692> the most wrong Pat has actually ever been
[1:31:21] <ape_hawk> because its reminds you of... you?
[1:31:22] <Badgerconda_> Pat you suck
[1:31:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> But he's the good skill-monkey!
[1:31:23] <%mikessdd> You got T3 HK and MF Canderous. The best peepo

[1:31:25] <%Seraphlul> Robotist FeelsBadMan
[1:31:27] <%BulbasaursCry> r2 d2 trash can robot
[1:31:27] <%CatastropheCorvid> I'm sure renaming him to EL-M0 might help.
[1:31:28] <TheRadIdeaMan> PAT ITS SO EASY TO NOT HATE THINGS
[1:31:29] <%illtima> you're R2D2 Fantasy insert
[1:31:30] <%threeheadedwalrus> karen is an anti-droid then

[1:31:37] <%MechArch> don't bully robut
[1:31:39] <%SirGO0SE> ALL of the none speech droids are R2D2s

[1:31:43] <+cdrom321> HK is just C3PO.
[1:31:45] <%ssjklyco> What abut the wookie from the first game?

[1:31:47] <%mikessdd> BUT PAT T3 IS SO USEFUL
[1:31:47] <s1rcuit> @GarbageQueenEllie probably because the Force has to do with energy and droids technically have electrical energy
[1:31:48] <%NovaKnightmare> You're playing a Star Wars game, Pat
[1:31:49] <%radda343> it's just a robot pat
[1:31:49] <Paciboyy> thats fair

[1:31:55] <%troxvon_the_lesser> Go-to is great actually
[1:31:58] <nzrai> And T3 shit talks all of them
[1:31:59] <%threeheadedwalrus> update the wiki real quick
[1:32:00] <%cosmicgoatee> Pat is pretty much the closest irl equivalent to a Jawa so LUL
[1:32:02] <mgotacon> He has good utility stats tho
[1:32:02] <%chiazam> It's just a robot Pat
[1:32:03] <%Undenizen> don't forget the birthing robot in episode 3
[1:32:08] <%CatastropheCorvid> Fun Fact! You can make T3 evil.
[1:32:08] <MassConnect> ermagerd
[1:32:11] <s1rcuit> @captainpodock he was born
[1:32:13] <MassConnect> I forgot GOTO existed
[1:32:13] <%Dunmarkh> @cdrom321 c3po should kill more people clearly
[1:32:15] <+Kurt_0> Hk is miles better than c3po
[1:32:16] <%SirGO0SE> FEET
[1:32:19] <olm46> Only the two
[1:32:21] <ne0bunny> is it because hes short?
[1:32:21] <Conky89> Darth Karen always complained about her fellow Sith to the Sith Lord.
[1:32:23] <mgotacon> >subvert the robot
[1:32:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> @CatastropheCorvid Yeaaaah make T3 evil!
[1:32:30] <%chiazam> T3 is an amazing skill monkey you lay off him
[1:32:31] <Coystick> T3 has so many girlfriends you're just jealous
[1:32:37] <DatAsuna> Pat hating on t3?
[1:32:37] <fuji_92> feet
[1:32:40] <%king_wragles> @AncelDeLambert Pat hates T3 apparently
[1:32:40] <%NovaKnightmare> C3po lost his family twice
[1:32:41] <%toolofparanoia> Who's the other droid, there's HK. T3 and who else?
[1:32:44] <%captainpodock> So the asshole enjoys other assholes?
[1:32:45] <ManfredA> yeh
[1:32:45] <%mikessdd> Yes Pat
[1:32:47] <subjectg> T3 gets all the robot puss
[1:32:48] <%damienlunas> It is absolutely better for everyone.
[1:32:49] <%Blank9> c3po has a personality based on the fact he sucks, it's good
[1:32:51] <%chiazam> ehhhhhhh
[1:32:52] <s1rcuit> sure
[1:32:53] <ManfredA> two weapons means twice the buffs
[1:32:53] <+Kurt_0> Do it
[1:32:54] <%Ipsenscastle> remember when everyone forced C3-PO to kill himself in that last movie?
[1:32:54] <%mikessdd> Everyone should have 2 weapons
[1:32:55] <dinnydanny777> Would a Karen dual wield?
[1:32:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I normally go for it for almost everyone.
[1:32:56] <%SirGO0SE> its better than 1 weapon you get 2
[1:32:56] <%Alazull> More damage, more equipment for stat bonuses
[1:32:56] <Zap_Rowsdower32> GOTO, technically
[1:32:57] <scrublordsamurai> except krea
[1:32:57] <%TinyLittleDancer> Drizzt wannabe
[1:32:57] <mgotacon> DPS monster
[1:32:57] <%BulbasaursCry> 2 weapons = more bang
[1:32:57] <%depressed_skeleton> double the sword double the stab stab
[1:32:58] <brachydios777> I don’t think I can get a solid read on Pat
[1:32:59] <asylumkon> best feat line in the game
[1:33:01] <Coystick> Two weapon fighting is for memers
[1:33:02] <%Blank9> 2 weapon fighting is great for anyone that's not pure mage
[1:33:02] <%CatastropheCorvid> @GarbageQueenEllie You can also make HK both a Light Side droid and a pacifist.
[1:33:05] <%AncelDeLambert> @king_wragles wuhoh
[1:33:05] <%damienlunas> Two Weapon Fighting is mathematically the best option. Toughness is not necessary.
[1:33:07] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt "That's a Star Was" says the man playing the Star Wars game.
[1:33:08] <notsoy> from a purely mechanical perspective, two weapons is better
[1:33:08] <%Monkeyweed21> better unless they use a heavy weapon
[1:33:12] <%Visorak6> Isnt toughness garbage in D&D?
[1:33:16] <DasFreekman> would you like two stat sticks or one?
[1:33:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> For HK and Mandalore I don't go two-weapon fighting because heavy blasters and blaster rifles don't benefit.
[1:33:17] <%VoidBaronJules> 2 weapon death squa
[1:33:18] <%BulbasaursCry> pat is a meme queen
[1:33:18] <mgotacon> If you have a party to fit it, go for it.

[1:33:38] <scrublordsamurai> t101Big t101Oof

[1:34:18] <%Ipsenscastle> Darth Memer
[1:34:24] <%captainpodock> Indeed Pat has become one with the meme.
[1:34:28] <mgotacon> lucky find

[1:34:49] <%troxvon_the_lesser> So Pat what are your plans for lightsaber type and color?
[1:34:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> Flurry is better in this game too
[1:34:56] <%toolofparanoia> dual wield is the true badass way
[1:35:02] <s1rcuit> I'm gonna swing my arms in this direction and if you get hit it's your fault
[1:35:02] <%CatastropheCorvid> @Dunmarkh Wicked luck
[1:35:05] <knoth_> flurry + multple weapons + force speed is amazing.
[1:35:05] <Broken_Sonex> @captainpodock Unlike Woolie, who still thinks he's a real person.

[1:36:32] <%troxvon_the_lesser> He's pretty lame
[1:36:33] <dinnydanny777> Bad English accent man?
[1:36:35] <DatAsuna> His actor is a mgtow
[1:36:36] <notenoughgirls> one time i completed his story in the first convo with him
[1:36:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Disciple is boring, the lore he gives you is interesting.
[1:36:39] <%Blank9> he likes books, that's the character
[1:36:40] <Badgerconda_> Blandmaiden is SO GOOD
[1:36:42] <+PkSilent01> He's a Tier 3 Sub
[1:36:45] <wembleyttv> Just remember asking that to a friend and getting told WTF WHY DO YOU LIKE THE 1ST GAME
[1:36:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> LUL
[1:36:47] <GarbageQueenEllie> @dinnydanny777 You have won the internet. Congrats
[1:36:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt If you hate Carth you will hate Disciple. He's Carth but with a valid connection to the protagonist. And he loves you.
[1:37:00] <%captainpodock> Who is Disciple?
[1:37:01] <+pally_din> Damn that's a good one
[1:37:03] <%Monkeyweed21> his only interesting moment is at the VERY END of his storyline @PatStaresAt
[1:37:04] <Conky89> Disciple is the typical bland dude found in all Bioware games.
[1:37:23] <%mikessdd> yeah no the first game isn't really made worse by kotor2 existing
[1:37:38] <%Alazull> He'd probably let you peg him
[1:38:02] <%Dunmarkh> @Alazull based
[1:38:03] <mihokspawn> No love for big tiddy Sith GF?
[1:38:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> Disciple is such a pussy-ass simp. Take him along with you and traumatize him with your Sithness
[1:38:05] <%captainpodock> So Diciple is Carth?
[1:38:12] <%AzureGale> sudo get me a soda
[1:38:17] <Broken_Sonex> Blandmaiden is the REAL Carth of this game.
[1:38:19] <dinnydanny777> Oh ffs he's voiced by the Cullen dude from Dragon Age that guy sucks NotLikeThis
[1:38:21] <PanicSwytch> gief will bodyslam paige for putting up the gate

[1:40:02] <+gespenst25> hey, who likes to be not healed? No one that's who.
[1:40:13] <Badgerconda_> Kotor 2 makes you so powerful it basically doesn't matter what your alignment is... I ran a full lightside guy that was just force-storming everything to death after a couple planets.
[1:40:21] <%Captainahab_37> hello everyone how goes the star war
[1:40:23] <%FacetiousAF> good evening friends of elmo and gief
[1:40:27] <subjectg> @grander76 i just don’t understand how this nobody from the first game became so important
[1:40:28] <Valentinius_Anodyne> If you're going big Force powers than it's fine taking the opposite alignment abilities
[1:40:36] <%mikessdd> Yeah you get so many force points it doesn't matter
[1:40:37] <DickieWoodsmall_279> force screm is elmo's dark side power
[1:40:42] <subjectg> whoops i meant @garbagequeenellie
[1:40:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> Kae'ryn needs tha Scream
[1:40:42] <Broken_Sonex> Force scream seems PERFECT for Karen

[1:42:14] <@SoFarFetched> I hope everyone is doing good.
[1:42:17] <%Bt_Robot> Shred your enemies with force powered screams!
[1:42:20] <Broken_Sonex> Elmo is Brock Lesnar and Geif is Goldberg. Every time they encounter is Survivor Series 2016
[1:42:24] <%SirGO0SE> lets put all the points into Force Kin :)
[1:42:24] <%s_xylocalsingles> watching STAR_ video saying Fans are the problem
[1:42:25] <secret_npc> I'm sure it's been brought up, but has Pat tried the Rise demo yet?
[1:42:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> wcdonnos
[1:42:29] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @SoFarFetched horny and scared of the future
[1:42:31] <Coystick> The gate keeps Pat out
[1:42:33] <+OmegaWeltall> So steve buchemi, how do you like KOTOR2?
[1:42:34] <@SoFarFetched> he did yesterday @secret_npc
[1:42:35] <%mikessdd> I thought the gate is to keep Pat in?
[1:42:39] <+OmegaWeltall> oh nm he's back
[1:42:41] <Clundy> Open the gates to Helm Deep! Release the Elmo!
[1:42:42] <%Zeroblazex> He is so fast because of his closeness to the floor
[1:42:42] <s1rcuit> @SoFarFetched I'm ok, my brother surprised me with a pizza
[1:42:52] <s1rcuit> @SoFarFetched how are you?
[1:42:53] <PanicSwytch> Don't say the F word around Gief
[1:43:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @GarbageQueenEllie I wouldn't say that. Disciple is hung up on the exile because they represent a missed path in life he wishes he had the chance to take. You were the master he wanted and by leaving for war you denied him the opportunity to be a jedi. Which made him doubt the Jedi as a whole.
[1:43:05] <secret_npc> MH Rise is...really bad
[1:43:13] <%SirGO0SE> What about Force Kin
[1:43:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Disciple is in love with the idea of the exile.
[1:43:26] <PanicSwytch> One Guy
[1:43:31] <%Alazull> @secret_npc Your bad
[1:43:37] <%Zeroblazex> Is it really?? @secret_npc

[1:43:49] <wembleyttv> jermaOneguy
[1:43:50] <%mikessdd> Rise is good
[1:43:50] <%AzureGale> wat
[1:43:52] <secret_npc> It's biggest departure the series has ever taken, Wire Bug is the centrepiece
[1:43:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Too_Much_Nukie Hate when that happens. Usually when you never get to know somebody and their flaws.
[1:43:55] <%walternatorz> keep us abreasted
[1:43:55] <LVL1_Scumbag> The marriage titty?
[1:43:56] <%Nobrev> go back to MHFU

[1:44:10] <%Bailey__gaming> I love present but no get
[1:44:18] <%SaiyanShoto> It is NOT bad it’s so good
[1:44:20] <%SirGO0SE> chat pls help me get pat to fall for force kin, ty :)
[1:44:27] <Broken_Sonex> When he comes back, he's probably gonna have Paige's bra on
[1:44:28] <$kingoftrashep> im digging that new animation
[1:44:29] <%radda343> boobies are temporary, star war is eternal
[1:44:29] <+krispen_wa> remember when shaggy was a jedi in the gennedy series
[1:44:36] <%captain_thickthighs> door dash can now send boobs
[1:44:38] <%TinyLittleDancer> Its OK not to like it, I can see the possible *sticking points*
[1:44:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> mark off the mid-stream sex square of your bingo cards
[1:44:40] <@SoFarFetched> I've so far only seen two people say monhun is bad. With one guy yesterday only saying it was bad cause his switch couldn't handle it.
[1:44:47] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @SoFarFetched it's not so bad, I'm trembling from fear so hard that it stimulates the prostate
[1:44:48] <echobee_tv> Genndy wars is so strong
[1:44:48] <@SoFarFetched> well monhun rise* in chat
[1:44:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> @SirGO0SE Just got that. We're all behind you lad
[1:44:51] <secret_npc> It's genuinely the worst experience I've ever had playing the MH series
[1:44:52] <%mikessdd> I mean. The wirebug is just a different version of things that already existed in the series soooo
[1:44:53] <Clundy> Buber @captain_thickthighs
[1:44:53] <%Zeroblazex> Not if Disney execs have any say in it!!
[1:44:57] <s1rcuit> @SoFarFetched np, it's easy for people to forget to check on others, especially after talking about themselves
[1:45:18] <%Bt_Robot> Gennedy made Mace Windu the coolest
[1:45:22] <secret_npc> No, the Wire Bug is completely baked into the game in ways other gimmicks in the past weren't
[1:45:23] <%captain_thickthighs> @Clundy buber?
[1:45:42] <%SaiyanShoto> Wirebug is so good and makes the gameplay so much more fun
[1:45:42] <s1rcuit> @Bt_Robot he made EVERYONE the coolest
[1:45:44] <Clundy> @captain_thickthighs it’s Uber but for boobs
[1:45:44] <DickieWoodsmall_279> WAS IT TITTOS

[1:46:52] <Sad_Badger> you gotta eat it in the closet for old times sake
[1:46:53] <%rekinom> clutch claw gave tenderize, it was only optional if you wanted to do less damage
[1:46:54] <%SirGO0SE> excuse me
[1:46:54] <Broken_Sonex> The word Cake for me. It's just makes me think about women's fat asses
[1:46:57] <%Zeroblazex> It does indeed
[1:46:59] <%BinaryFireball> til of the puppicino
[1:47:02] <s1rcuit> @Bt_Robot he took Star Wars in directions that both Lucas and Disney are too cowardly and unimaginative to go
[1:47:03] <secret_npc> I cleaned up Iceborne and almost never used Clutch Claw
[1:47:05] <jtsoppy137> sounds legit
[1:47:08] <Coystick> I physically can't eat cake without a coffee to dunk, it's a waste otherwise

[1:49:26] <%Alazull> Gotta talk to the manager fast!
[1:49:28] <TheRadIdeaMan> THE MOST OBNOXIOUS NERDS, HEDI
[1:49:32] <TheRadIdeaMan> JEDI*
[1:49:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "I need to speak to the manager!" *Force Speed*
[1:49:40] <%BinaryFireball> ok ok!
[1:49:41] <Nix_Abyss> space Karen PepeLaugh
[1:49:46] <%BinaryFireball> so if jedis are nerds...
[1:49:52] <%Zeroblazex> I mean hey man, pat hates rare so you’re in the right stream
[1:49:54] <%jessyg920> I'm late to the party here. Did Pat really make a Sith Lord named Karen?
[1:49:59] <%rekinom> It's okay to be wrong
[1:50:01] <%YakumoYomi> @Zeroblazex We'll have to wait for the full game. If the Wirebug is necessary to get to some areas, then that could be a problem.
[1:50:04] <%Alazull> Ruining days at the speed of sound got coupons to redeem so follow my rainbow!
[1:50:04] <%BinaryFireball> does that mean that they like ... like
[1:50:10] <%Zeroblazex> OH MY GOD
[1:50:10] <%BinaryFireball> nerd stuff?
[1:50:23] <%BinaryFireball> like anime
[1:50:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The customer service here on Peragus is unacceptable.
[1:50:34] <%BulbasaursCry> *force choke* I want to speak to your manager
[1:50:34] <$RealThiele> maybe wirebug gauge can get higher too than demo value
[1:50:35] <%FacetiousAF> pat you gotta be more evil
[1:50:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Kae'Ryn Drippo
[1:50:39] <TheRadIdeaMan> Bruh what do you think they had those libraries for lmao
[1:50:39] <%FacetiousAF> Greater Goods and Services
[1:50:44] <LoudmicRPG> Oh, still on Paragus?
[1:50:45] <%Bt_Robot> Pat, do you feel the need to shout Lightning Bolt?
[1:50:45] <%BinaryFireball> is yoda a naruto fan?
[1:50:49] <%Zeroblazex> @YakumoYomi Oof true true that would just be terrible level design
[1:50:52] <+TheotherKristian> I want to speak to ypue
[1:50:53] <%Alazull> Kae'ryn is on the drip
[1:50:53] <austinj24> Sith watch dub
[1:50:57] <+TheotherKristian> fuck
[1:50:59] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Too_Much_Nukie It really is tho.
[1:51:01] <$BinaryFireball> I mean like libraries are extinct though
[1:51:02] <Broken_Sonex> @BinaryFireball Probably
[1:51:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no
[1:51:15] <%BinaryFireball> ok ok so if yoda is a weeb
[1:51:19] <%Zeroblazex> @binaryfireball he did do that faux rasengan once..
[1:51:20] <%BinaryFireball> does that mean
[1:51:20] <TheRadIdeaMan> Why do you think Jedi keep their holocrons secre?
[1:51:25] <TheRadIdeaMan> All the anime tiddies
[1:51:27] <secret_npc> I just hope MH World 2 is more of the same, I despite gimmicks being introduced that completely change how a game is played
[1:51:36] <secret_npc> despise*
[1:51:38] <%Zeroblazex> I think Boba was weeb
[1:51:39] <Klefth> Run like the manager's at the other end of that hallway, Kaer'yn
[1:51:42] <+TheNewZealandStory> does mental illness exist in star wars
[1:51:46] <$RealThiele> she will trample your ass for a sale
[1:51:46] <%BinaryFireball> ok so yoda IS into vore
[1:51:51] <%BinaryFireball> alright got all my questions answered
[1:51:52] <%Ixiah> @PatStaresAt did you ever play the old republic ? how is the story ?
[1:51:53] <%BinaryFireball> thanks guys
[1:51:55] <%Zeroblazex> You can tell he was a huge fucking closet nerd
[1:52:06] <Javi9563> more where that came from
[1:52:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> don't ask Pat about TOR
[1:52:09] <%chiazam> THERES MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM
[1:52:23] <TheRadIdeaMan> Force Storm makes every encounter a joke lmao
[1:52:27] <abelincoln_catpuncher> hey Pat, what do think of TOR?
[1:52:29] <wembleyttv> Lighting and heal is all you need
[1:52:31] <%Ixiah> "so i grinded sith points offscreen"
[1:52:31] <%Alazull> 2nd Tier Force Lightning is the drip
[1:52:33] <+Ryuuken1789> Just commenting for the Kenny PogChamp. Let's go! doodCrazy
[1:52:41] <%Zeroblazex> that’s when the psaBig crunchy zaps happen
[1:52:42] <$RealThiele> once i get the CEOs email its all over
[1:52:44] <%chiazam> oh man
[1:52:46] <%BinaryFireball> pat doesnt think he acts
[1:52:48] <Javi9563> force storm trivializes the whole game and it's not even funny
[1:52:49] <DickieWoodsmall_279> RIP the TORtanic
[1:52:52] <+Spoonsire> I don't think there's an encounter that needs more than 2 force storms, at least non-boss encounters
[1:52:53] <@SoFarFetched> @secret_npc Would MHW2 bring Clutch Claw 2.0?
[1:52:54] <%BinaryFireball> pure raw execution
[1:52:55] <randomahole> just like Jerma's build, LUL
[1:52:56] <%SirGO0SE> Pat you know about Booba Fett? He was a clone of Bobba Fett in the extended universe
[1:53:01] <s1rcuit> @TheRadIdeaMan no it makes encounters nonexistent, jokes are funny
[1:53:02] <%DothMyNugsBequeathMe> tor isnt real :)
[1:53:06] <%BinaryFireball> he's watching
[1:53:11] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt because it's where he belongs

[1:53:23] <austinj24> Social Distance
[1:53:24] <%king_wragles> "if you were closer you'd hear him Atton"
[1:53:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "the help"
[1:53:34] <TheRadIdeaMan> @s1rcuit I mean Lightning Go Brrr is always funny to me lmao
[1:53:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Are you going to treat T3 like a sapient being or a trash can?
[1:53:55] <dinnydanny777> Does the game actually explain this? LUL
[1:53:56] <%BinaryFireball> that dude looks like nerdy future peter parker
[1:53:59] <chhdez> Both
[1:54:02] <Broken_Sonex> I bet Mace Windu LOVES Naruto
[1:54:03] <+SinisterBroccoli> Why are telos and peragus so awful?
[1:54:08] <%mikessdd> WHAT ABOUT CANDEROUS
[1:54:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> but darkside Mira

[1:54:30] <DickieWoodsmall_279> BELIEVE IT MUTHAFUCKA
[1:54:31] <jackeroff3> anakin enjoys attack on titan
[1:54:32] <Nix_Abyss> I hate that that makes so much sense
[1:54:33] <%Promessa_EX> the purple lightsaber is pimp
[1:54:35] <+rainlily1245> Mace Windu hated Anakin, who's basically evil Naruto
[1:54:35] <Nix_Abyss> LUL
[1:54:35] <%chiazam> oh come on pat, make em your evil subjects

[1:54:46] <%BinaryFireball> mace windu totally love naruto
[1:54:50] <%maenos2> mace windu big fan of hentai though
[1:54:51] <%YakumoYomi> Mace Windu secretly wishes he were Killer Bee
[1:54:53] <abelincoln_catpuncher> how fucked is y
[1:54:54] <%toolofparanoia> Mandalorian are the most fuck most things up dudes
[1:54:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Anakin was the coolest guy
[1:54:55] <subjectg> The purple lightsaber is a sendup to his best girl, ino

[1:55:04] <abelincoln_catpuncher> what is chat talking about lmao
[1:55:10] <mihokspawn> If you like eVil, the BigTiddySithGF like eVill too
[1:55:10] <%BinaryFireball> BobaFett simps Gintama
[1:55:13] <%Bt_Robot> He does ninja run
[1:55:13] <%Zeroblazex> Nah Mace windu liked BESERK
[1:55:14] <+TheotherKristian> Darth Vadet should be a legit fan of sailor moon
[1:55:15] <%BinaryFireball> also a fact
[1:55:20] <%RetroCop87> Naruto, from this day you will be a Hokage, but we do Not grant you the rank of chuniin
[1:55:24] <%Ixiah> do animals have force powers too ?
[1:55:28] <%Zeroblazex> @binaryfireball that was pretty spot on
[1:55:32] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @BinaryFireball HE SAID THE WOOOOOOORD
[1:55:35] <Broken_Sonex> Oh dude Anakin would LOVE Obito!
[1:55:36] <+bear_breaker20> naruto is dookoo's domain
[1:55:40] <%BinaryFireball> i have knowledge
[1:55:41] <TheRadIdeaMan> @Ixiah SOME, but rarely
[1:55:45] <scrublordsamurai> t101Noot t101Noot
[1:55:49] <subjectg> That’s outrageous, how can you be a member of Anbu and not be a Jonin?
[1:55:50] <mihokspawn> @Zeroblazex So does Vrook
[1:55:51] <dinnydanny777> @ixiah Kind of but not really
[1:55:52] <%maenos2> @Ixiah i believe so. there at least used to be space dragons with force powers
[1:55:53] <%BinaryFireball> THE WOOOORD
[1:56:01] <chhdez> I can tell Pat's excited by all these numbers and min maxing
[1:56:16] <%SirGO0SE> uh oh u in trooouble
[1:56:24] <+SinisterBroccoli> @PatStaresAt are you going sith marauder?
[1:56:26] <%Ixiah> and yet he refuses to play path of exile LUL
[1:56:31] <%Zeroblazex> Man..I forgot about vrook..he literally can’t die fast enough
[1:56:33] <s1rcuit> dude he lives there, he should be asking you that
[1:56:34] <TheRadIdeaMan> Theres a few animals in the Legends that just use Force as part of their bodily function
[1:56:37] <subjectg> Never should’ve come here!
[1:56:42] <%BinaryFireball> I dont think he actually likes big numbers just big feels
[1:56:43] <%DothMyNugsBequeathMe> a sith lawd?
[1:56:45] <scrublordsamurai> oh no its karen kill her with fire before she gets to our robomanager
[1:56:46] <%ssjklyco> Oh Lord, he sithin
[1:56:47] <+projectmanatees> I bet GOTO reads tails gets trolled
[1:56:50] <$ThatOneIceBear> I dunno what Pat is doing but number go up so it has to be good
[1:56:50] <%BinaryFireball> EVE players like big numbers
[1:56:59] <%Bt_Robot> Monster closet.
[1:57:00] <%BinaryFireball> rpeegeee love big feel
[1:57:00] <%Zeroblazex> Victory cake
[1:57:17] <%StaceMcGate> how does this game feel on controller?
[1:57:18] <%SirGO0SE> GOTO loves ghost in the shell
[1:57:21] <mgotacon> That cake looks fucking great.
[1:57:24] <DickieWoodsmall_279> all mmo ners love big number
[1:57:36] <+SinisterBroccoli> StaceMcGate feels like it did in 2005
[1:57:44] <KaiserMario> I thought you were doing the opposite Woolie did? Cause space wizard with force lightning is exactly what Woolie did...
[1:57:46] <%Ixiah> put it all into pyro LUL
[1:57:46] <%Zeroblazex> Damn these anime choices have been pretty good tonight gents and ladies
[1:57:48] <subjectg> GOTO has an Aigis bodypillow
[1:58:00] <%BinaryFireball> do it
[1:58:04] <+SinisterBroccoli> it's worth it
[1:58:04] <jtsoppy137> yeah
[1:58:04] <%BinaryFireball> make him ultra
[1:58:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> If you do that you don't get his sneak attack feats though.
[1:58:08] <mgotacon> Dew it
[1:58:12] <%BinaryFireball> make him the ultra nerd
[1:58:12] <+thegostofjon> thats what wolie did
[1:58:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And sneak attack triggers on stunned enemies.
[1:58:14] <%Undenizen> this was a woolie strat
[1:58:14] <+projectmanatees> GOTO loves Gantz
[1:58:16] <%StaceMcGate> thats what I always did
[1:58:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> just like the MC in Kotor 1. Don't level up past 2
[1:58:22] <%StaceMcGate> stopped levelling them at lvl 4
[1:58:24] <+SinisterBroccoli> just don't make him a jedi
[1:58:25] <Broken_Sonex> BUT.....
[1:58:28] <+canseesea> I do that with all of my characters, they stay children until they're ready to be a jedi
[1:58:29] <mgotacon> woolieMIRIN
[1:58:30] <%ssjklyco> waht you eating?
[1:58:31] <s1rcuit> now I'm reminded of how mad I am that Gendy didn't do more Star Wars shit
[1:58:37] <%BinaryFireball> why it suck?
[1:58:38] <%Bt_Robot> Obi-Wan is deep into Cowboy Bebop lore
[1:58:44] <Coystick> RESTART
[1:58:45] <mgotacon> Soiled it
[1:58:46] <%BinaryFireball> sunk cost flaccid
[1:58:47] <%Zeroblazex> Mandalore liked Kamen rider but only Black and the W movie
[1:58:49] <s1rcuit> @ssjklyco cake
[1:58:50] <chhdez> Pat will become the borg cube
[1:58:51] <amonimis> what kinda cake is that anyway @patstaresat
[1:58:51] <+balkonas1> Are you eating dog food?
[1:58:56] <%Bt_Robot> Anakin cannot get enough FATE.
[1:58:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Woolie gave the characters _some_ levels pre-jedi so they could get specific feats.
[1:59:01] <+Soliloquy123> You end up OP in this game no matter what you do, it could not matter less imo
[1:59:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Or skills.
[1:59:03] <subjectg> C3P0 secretly watches Chobits while no one’s looking
[1:59:03] <%Ranryu692> it's super worth it
[1:59:05] <Coystick> Yes, Pat is eating dog food cake
[1:59:08] <%StaceMcGate> @BinaryFireball you basically can't upgrade non-force user party members until midgame
[1:59:10] <$RealThiele> any food is dog food if gief reaches it
[1:59:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> A level 2 Bendak kill in the first game was so fucking hard
[1:59:15] <+SinisterBroccoli> I KNEW IT
[1:59:16] <abelincoln_catpuncher> ahhh, I always knew Pat ate the dog food
[1:59:16] <+Ryuuken1789> Dog food cake? doodBait
[1:59:17] <%ssjklyco> That's why he mad
[1:59:17] <RamenRiderZ> Disney should stop being cowards and make a gun jedi
[1:59:18] <%AzureGale> LUL
[1:59:21] <mgotacon> That why gief was eyeing it up
[1:59:22] <%walternatorz> I always knew Pat got a dog to hide his dog food eating habits
[1:59:23] <Coystick> He borks
[1:59:23] <%Alazull> I mean if the dog food is tasty who cares?
[1:59:26] <scrublordsamurai> make sure not to shoot anybody in the upcomeing turret sequence for most exp
[1:59:28] <%AzureGale> Gief is like "GIVE ME CAKE"
[1:59:29] <%toolofparanoia> The boi cries
[1:59:32] <s1rcuit> @ssjklyco Paige gave it to him when her Uber gave it as a special or something like that
[1:59:34] <Zeif00> just another day huh
[1:59:34] <ravioli_ronin> Can’t wait for Kreia to tell you how apathy is poggers
[1:59:35] <DatAsuna> light later
[1:59:38] <dinnydanny777> Light side later
[1:59:38] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Yes
[1:59:40] <%Monkeyweed21> light side later
[1:59:40] <%Visorak6> He spent loads of mana
[1:59:40] <%SirGO0SE> light later :)
[1:59:41] <%Zeroblazex> See Gief is mad you’re devouring all his food
[1:59:41] <theanora1> you drink redbull, so it's not much different
[1:59:41] <+SinisterBroccoli> jedi master doesn't matter
[1:59:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Light later
[1:59:43] <%StaceMcGate> light later
[1:59:43] <jtsoppy137> you can
[1:59:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> DS powers just cost more
[1:59:43] <%DeadManProp> light LATER
[1:59:44] <abelincoln_catpuncher> yeah but he had so much force he could spam it for days
[1:59:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Alignment doesn't matter when you reach high level because you have so many force points.
[1:59:44] <Badgerconda_> It's Kotor 2?
[1:59:44] <Klefth> LIGHT LATER
[1:59:44] <LoudmicRPG> Not being nice to Kreia? Man, you gonna let down best grandma like that? @PatStaresAt
[1:59:45] <+thegostofjon> light side evil powers
[1:59:45] <%MalekDracarus> Still a good move
[1:59:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> HE HAD EBOUGH FP TO NOT CARE ABOUT THE PENALTY sbfpSetIn
[1:59:46] <%MidnightBurst12> ungodly amounts of force points
[1:59:48] <mgotacon> woolieYE
[1:59:48] <MassConnect> V was a weird coach
[1:59:48] <dinnydanny777> :)
[1:59:49] <%SolidusRex> You can use Force Lightning as a light sider EASILY
[1:59:49] <asylumkon> nothing stops you from using it
[1:59:49] <%radda343> all food is dog food if you ask dog
[1:59:49] <$RealThiele> evil then redemption
[1:59:49] <%Zeroblazex> I mean
[1:59:50] <+canseesea> I think he had super high wisdom and charisma
[1:59:52] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It worked fine, he had force points out the wazoo
[1:59:52] <Badgerconda_> You can still use darkside powers if you're lightside pat.
[1:59:53] <subjectg> It doesn’t even matter late game
[1:59:53] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt he started dark and moved to light
[1:59:54] <DatAsuna> Woolie picked a ton of dark side choices and did the bare minimum of major choices light side
[1:59:55] <Javi9563> just start as a consular and you get a shit ton of force points anyway
[1:59:57] <dinnydanny777> Twerka industries
[1:59:59] <+CaptainJax> EVIL NOW LIGHT LATER
[2:00:01] <%Ranryu692> yeah, and?
[2:00:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You'll have enough FP too.
[2:00:04] <%TheLakinessMonster> He went with the force storm. Light side can still use it at higher cost
[2:00:04] <$RealThiele> evil = lightning
[2:00:04] <austinj24> MAYBE IF U WATCHED
[2:00:05] <ManfredA> FP is like candy in this game
[2:00:07] <+LionKagura> @PatStaresAt they did dark side shit to get certain things
[2:00:09] <Broken_Sonex> You have so much for points by the end of the game, it doesn't matter
[2:00:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Because you're going Sith Lord.
[2:00:13] <scrublordsamurai> light later gave him big power
[2:00:14] <%chiazam> YEAH AND?
[2:00:14] <%CatastropheCorvid> High Wis+Cha also means less penalty
[2:00:16] <DatAsuna> Basically he only made the essential major choices light and did every smaller choice dark
[2:00:19] <mgotacon> UNLIMITED POWAHHHH!
[2:00:23] <%StaceMcGate> a Sith LORD?
[2:00:27] <Klefth> It's like stats in this game are FUCKING BUSTED
[2:00:29] <%honeyman18> Always take the money, and it's "for the kids"
[2:00:32] <%Monkeyweed21> see if you murder those people and steal their gear now, then you can save the galaxy later
[2:00:36] <ravioli_ronin> A SITH LORT?
[2:00:37] <DatAsuna> E.g. pick the ithorians over czerka but then do every other dark side thing on telos
[2:00:39] <Psyramics> Light Side Later literally just means doing bad things now that make things better later, like going back in time and killing Hitler
[2:00:42] <%chiazam> Woolie was busted
[2:00:43] <abelincoln_catpuncher> hehehe fingers go zappy zapp
[2:00:46] <%Ranryu692> light side later was doing evil stuff for good rewards/content, and then using a cheat engine to maximize light side points
[2:00:48] <%Fooguwu> "Light later" is when you sell 10 slaves for enough money to save 1000 lives later
[2:00:50] <+canseesea> Woolie also hacked his save before the final mission because his plan went bad
[2:00:51] <+AnthraxJohnson> Builds don’t matter it’s all gonna end in Force Storm anyway
[2:00:58] <+GrassCannon> For the Greater Good(s and services)
[2:00:59] <GarbageQueenEllie> coward
[2:00:59] <+SinisterBroccoli> like he kept the twilek slave
[2:01:01] <+CaptainJax> get that slave girl to fill your fannypack
[2:01:03] <jtsoppy137> V held his had LUL
[2:01:05] <DickieWoodsmall_279> maybe if you cared enough to watch your friend's LPs you would know these things PAT
[2:01:07] <%honeyman18> heh
[2:01:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> thanks DatAsuna
[2:01:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah he had to cheat to get his light back up.
[2:01:11] <%Ranryu692> yeah, Little V sucks
[2:01:12] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt He only did dark side when it benefited him @PatStaresAt
[2:01:15] <KaiserMario> Yeah LittleV fucked up
[2:01:15] <%Zeroblazex> Save states were indeed a thing
[2:01:19] <ravioli_ronin> Death T3 was pretty good
[2:01:22] <%honeyman18> was darth T3 though
[2:01:22] <asylumkon> thats not true

[2:01:25] <$ThatOneIceBear> OhMyDog
[2:01:26] <Gallhint> Woolie didn't play V did LUL
[2:01:27] <%Garthunox> light side later sounds stupid
[2:01:30] <+SinisterBroccoli> hey don't rag on LittleV
[2:01:38] <abelincoln_catpuncher> I think they wanted to see everything and get full light side
[2:01:38] <tattleworm> he was trying to max out influence with everyone which is basically impossible unless you perfectly follow a guide
[2:01:39] <DatAsuna> Well the save hack was just because they shit talked mira too much to max her influence
[2:01:41] <%Zeroblazex> Idk about sucking shit just went awry at the last second
[2:01:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Do you remember how to use solo mode? That would've been the smart move.
[2:01:47] <%Ranryu692> nah, V fucking sucks
[2:01:49] <DatAsuna> And they ignored g0t0 too much
[2:01:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> @DatAsuna lol
[2:01:53] <%RetroCop87> Little V screwed up, but saying he sucks is just you being salt for him telling you to shut up
[2:01:59] <%BinaryFireball> man remember when bluetooth headsets made you look cool?
[2:02:01] <%Monkeyweed21> Light side later means that if you kill those people and steal their stuff now, then you can save the galaxy later @PatStaresAt
[2:02:01] <Badgerconda_> does Pat hate Woolie now too? I don't know the newest lore.
[2:02:09] <Gallhint> little v is rad but nah he definitely held woolied hands super tight
[2:02:18] <DickieWoodsmall_279> you guys are mean, V is the Ultimate Top Tier Backseat Gamer 2020
[2:02:18] <DatAsuna> So light later didn't actually screw them, wanting to do an all influence run without a guide did
[2:02:19] <AMUSERNAME> I wouldn't say it was bad. Little V did a good Sherpa job making sure that Woolie would get to see the most important/memorable content out of a single playthrough.
[2:02:20] <Klefth> Little V was great and is great during the Yakuzies LP as well
[2:02:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Why are you not having T3 disarm mines?
[2:02:26] <stardustcrusad3r> whats a little v
[2:02:26] <%chiazam> V was great
[2:02:27] <RamenRiderZ> Chat's butthurt because V told them to STFU about Halo spoilers Kappa
[2:02:27] <+SinisterBroccoli> V is great
[2:02:31] <%maenos2> wasn't a fan of how hand-holdy V was honestly
[2:02:32] <%Zeroblazex> Ok I’ll agree to that I’ve the hand holding was much
[2:02:34] <KaiserMario> I don't hate LittleV, I just think he doesn't let Woolie play
[2:02:43] <+krispen_wa> Is Pat planning to do da EVUL playthrough or is this a good guy playthrough
[2:02:45] <Broken_Sonex> @Ranryu692 I bet your one of the people mad because they didn't like Mira
[2:02:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> But she doesn't have nearly the same INT modifier.
[2:02:50] <ravioli_ronin> Lmao it was a fine LP; if you don’t like it, go play the game how you want to instead of crying about it 😂
[2:02:52] <%dekkitout> V being a heel to chat is the stuff of dreams

[2:03:14] <vehementvadr> no grenade the pregnant women, double kill
[2:03:14] <%BinaryFireball> V is a great cohost you dumbos
[2:03:14] <+Huskylluvr> im only getting one kotor game. should I get one or two?
[2:03:15] <%radda343> he mad about somthing
[2:03:15] <+SinisterBroccoli> well that's because we all know Woolie will never play the game ever again so why not hold his hips
[2:03:18] <+krispen_wa> V being a heel to chat makes the VODs insufferable
[2:03:19] <%chiazam> @dekkitout Him walking up to the camera was GOLD
[2:03:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> As long as you don't fist the grenade into them. That's going too far

[2:03:25] <DickieWoodsmall_279> Chat angry because V does the backseat gaming for them Kappa

[2:03:34] <ravioli_ronin> Babies: the ultimate explosives delivery device
[2:03:38] <%Zeroblazex> Oh snap
[2:03:40] <abelincoln_catpuncher> Did Kylo Ren name himself after the dreaded, galaxy wide known Darth Kay'ren?
[2:03:41] <MattchoManYe> LittleV hand held a lot, talk over major moments, and was super condescending to a lot of the chat
[2:03:47] <Gallhint> @dickiewoodsmall_279 LUL
[2:03:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> Why didn't V and Woolz like Mira again?
[2:03:49] <%Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 Nah, it was the general lack of being funny or interesting
[2:03:49] <scrublordsamurai> time to go full COULTER
[2:03:54] <KaiserMario> @RetroCop87 That is also true, but I like that part
[2:03:54] <AMUSERNAME> Little V's role was effectively that of a tour guide for the game, showing off the highlights. If you dislike that sort of playstyle, that's fair, but not an objective flaw.
[2:03:57] <%barkon345> @Huskylluvr get part 2 for pc and use the restore content mod

[2:04:24] <ravioli_ronin> @abelincoln_catpuncher nah he named himself after just some guy
[2:04:25] <DatAsuna> @GarbageQueenEllie just a clash of personality
[2:04:26] <%chiazam> AHAHAHAHAHAHA
[2:04:27] <%BinaryFireball> because i forget what T3 is
[2:04:30] <mgotacon> casul gloves
[2:04:32] <%Monkeyweed21> would you rather have sex with Paige or a robot
[2:04:33] <%BigCoffee> Just think of T-3 as robo gief or robo elmo and it's a lot more adorable
[2:04:38] <%jessyg920> Darth T3 making a comeback?
[2:04:38] <%chiazam> You forgot
[2:04:42] <DatAsuna> imagine hating T3
[2:04:42] <%StaceMcGate> I liked LittleV co-streaming, and lets be real, Woolie needed the hand holding
[2:04:44] <abelincoln_catpuncher> is Darth T3 your Sith Lord, Pat??
[2:04:48] <Gallhint> ain't t3 one of them john Connor movies
[2:04:52] <+highlordspectra> @PatStaresAt fun fact I'm getting both KOTORs on pc
[2:04:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> @krispen_wa But doesnt the rpg protagonist do that like all the time?
[2:04:56] <%Alazull> Kae'ryn has a little Pam energy
[2:05:00] <%BinaryFireball> should pat get a giant hamsterball for zangief?
[2:05:02] <DatAsuna> At this point in the story T3 literally spent like 5 years alone on nathema rebuilding the ebon hawk to escape lol
[2:05:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> sbfpSetIn
[2:05:04] <%brickwall35> T3 is a lil pogchamp
[2:05:05] <%maenos2> uh oh
[2:05:06] <%barkon345> @Huskylluvr seriously do not play the game without the mod. its damn near unplayable without it
[2:05:06] <+krispen_wa> V was fine for KOTOR II because there was SO MUCH missable content
[2:05:07] <DatAsuna> T3's seen some shit
[2:05:09] <+SinisterBroccoli> woolie also wanted the hand holding
[2:05:10] <%Wallabri> uh oh

[2:06:07] <%brickwall35> IT'S OVER ZANGIEF, I HAVE THE HIGH GROUND
[2:06:10] <RiverBirch> He only cheated for narrative shit?
[2:06:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> Btw what's the policy on spoilers here? Can we blab or imply or nah?
[2:06:18] <%Alazull> It's what happens when you shove your head up your own as
[2:06:21] <%arancet> so what horrible thing did paige order that she had to buy you off with cake?
[2:06:22] <%barkon345> yea teh reason Woolie orginaly brought on Little V was becasue he knew he would get him to not miss anything in the game
[2:06:24] <ravioli_ronin> Lmao @ everyone crying about V
[2:06:24] <abelincoln_catpuncher> hating LittleV when chat literally spoils everything is so ironic and hilarious
[2:06:25] <%RetroCop87> no spoil
[2:06:25] <tattleworm> he was trying to max out influence with everyone which is basically impossible unless you perfectly follow a guide
[2:06:26] <%BinaryFireball> oh did he have to cheat to fix his alignment?
[2:06:28] <Broken_Sonex> @Ranryu692 To be fair, he WAS an asshole to the chat
[2:06:29] <asylumkon> woolie didnt screw anything up they just saved edited high influence to see the conversations
[2:06:29] <DatAsuna> @RiverBirch Yeah for the mira/g0t0 influence checks
[2:06:32] <DickieWoodsmall_279> V is just based and redpilled and nerds in chat can't handle being put in their place
[2:06:33] <%Monkeyweed21> V made a very convincing arguement that fall damage isn't a thing in Star Wars @PatStaresAt
[2:06:33] <+LionKagura> @Alazull Facts LUL
[2:06:35] <%brickwall35> @garbagequeenellie he's played this before
[2:06:40] <highfivesquash> spoilers this games ending involves LIGHT SABERS
[2:06:45] <AMUSERNAME> @PatStaresAt It was a fair mix of decisions. He basically did a mixed alignment playthrough to max out plotlines / alignments.
[2:06:49] <TourettesPlays> FINALLY leaving Peragus
[2:06:52] <%Zeroblazex> He was warned about his dialogue choices but wanted to play it how he would actually respond
[2:06:57] <Coystick> Why is she whining?
[2:07:01] <austinj24> Imagine hating V
[2:07:02] <AncelDeLambert> YOU WANTED THE DOG
[2:07:02] <+SinisterBroccoli> this is why I don't read chat
[2:07:07] <SaltyAzteca> oof
[2:07:09] <Klefth> @Ranryu692 Kinda for good reason
[2:07:12] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Pat said fuck it to looking at what choices to make cause he didn't wanna keep looking at the guide to make sure he didnt miss shit.
[2:07:16] <+Huskylluvr> spoilers: this game is based on the popular movie series, "Star Wars"
[2:07:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> I mean, chat is gonna chat, if you wanna not spoil yourself you should consider sub only mode or not look at it
[2:07:17] <+krispen_wa> Karen just waving at nothing
[2:07:20] <$RealThiele> paaaaa tuuhhhhh
[2:07:25] <DatAsuna> Yeah I think a lot of the complaints are over the top

[2:08:48] <Klefth> Oh he is THE BIGGEST hack
[2:08:48] <%orcstr16> I don't get the v hate. Yeah he condescended to the people that were spoiling the game because those people were ruining it for any newbies in the chat AND Woolie, wo it felt earned really. I thought his banter and discussions were good.
[2:08:49] <ravioli_ronin> Did anyone else break a terminal in the next area and make progress impossible?

[2:20:14] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @supra_nightmare Pat's Shit, coming *when it's ready*
[2:20:16] <%Zeroblazex> I think about that way too often. It haunts me
[2:20:29] <%BinaryFireball> @Zeroblazex I dont not tell me more
[2:20:30] <+Huskylluvr> i dont know that fact.
[2:20:31] <dinnydanny777> Do you think the Jedi force the poo away like in Harry Potter
[2:20:48] <dinnydanny777> Maybe they use lightning to dispose of the poo
[2:20:49] <%BinaryFireball> is that a real HP fact?
[2:20:56] <mgotacon> You mean like force grab the shit?
[2:20:56] <%BinaryFireball> that the old wizards just magicked their shit away?
[2:21:04] <dinnydanny777> @binaryfireball Yes LUL
[2:21:05] <$RealThiele> they commit their shit to the living force so it disperses like vapor
[2:21:07] <%BinaryFireball> like they would just poop their pants wherever they were
[2:21:10] <$ThatOneIceBear> Yes
[2:21:10] <%BinaryFireball> and just fuckin
[2:21:11] <%dekkitout> That is actual HP lore
[2:21:15] <%TheLakinessMonster> Yup, JK rowling made it canon with her tweets
[2:21:17] <DickieWoodsmall_279> oh yeah, a lot of people who go to times square wear diapers because of the crowds being impossible to escape from
[2:21:23] <%BinaryFireball> WHERE DID IT ALL GO THOUGH?
[2:21:23] <%Zeroblazex> Yeah..in Times Square everyone watching the ball drop is wearing adult diapers because they’re packed in like sardines
[2:21:29] <%Zeroblazex> Can you imagine the smell
[2:21:29] <%BinaryFireball> where is wizard shit mountain???
[2:21:29] <RamenRiderZ> Yup, it was when Rowling went silly
[2:21:31] <%dekkitout> JK said that shit leaving everyone to just ruminate tajWHY
[2:21:35] <+Huskylluvr> @dickiewoodsmall_279 sorry what
[2:21:43] <+canseesea> Harry Potter's twitter lore is the best part of harry potter since the books/movies ended
[2:21:45] <mgotacon> u wot
[2:21:55] <mgotacon> Whew lad
[2:22:02] <%Zeroblazex> Thousands of adults. Hundreds of gallons of piss and Poo by New Year’s Day
[2:22:03] <%BinaryFireball> like there's gotta be a dragon guarding some gold up on wizard shit mountain
[2:22:05] <%SirGO0SE> @Zeroblazex their diapies are packed in too
[2:22:07] <%BinaryFireball> all those rich wizards
[2:22:09] <+canseesea> JK Rowling is clearly batshit insane and at least that was entertaining for a while
[2:22:11] <%BinaryFireball> with their golden flakes
[2:22:20] <+Huskylluvr> yall still talking about HP and ignoring people shitting themselves in time square
[2:22:45] <%dekkitout> @canseesea Until the transphobia thing, then it was gauche
[2:22:51] <%Zeroblazex> @sirgo0se the thought of that is awful. No amount of money in the world would make me wanna be in the middle of that
[2:22:52] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @Huskylluvr I mean let's be honest, that happens every day
[2:22:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Fill those diapies up.
[2:23:10] <DickieWoodsmall_279> FILL UP THOSE DIAPIES GAMERS
[2:23:11] <%Zeroblazex> Sadly, it’s true..
[2:23:17] <%baka_sugoi> po po
[2:23:17] <%BinaryFireball> oh I figured it out... all the wizard shit went inside her mouth
[2:23:19] <+canseesea> @dekkitout yeah, the while ended.
[2:23:28] <%Zeroblazex> Some people treat everyday like New Years
[2:23:35] <%BinaryFireball> and thats when the transphobic shit started spewing
[2:23:40] <%Zeroblazex> Has a whole new meaning
[2:23:43] <+Huskylluvr> @dekkitout I mean lets be honest. tons of jewish people talked about how her books were antisemitic.

[2:24:19] <%BinaryFireball> @DickieWoodsmall_279 it's called pig play .... I think?
[2:24:31] <%Zeroblazex> Appropriate
[2:24:32] <%BinaryFireball> I had a friend who did work in the industry and had to research shit
[2:24:34] <+freelancer_960> PogChamp
[2:24:36] <owazowski> Pat's really taking his time changing into a new diaper
[2:24:37] <$RealThiele> yoshi eggs probably have quite the smell hahaha

[2:24:45] <+Huskylluvr> why would they call it pig play
[2:24:53] <%BinaryFireball> can you eat yoshi eggs?
[2:24:53] <%SirGO0SE> crinkling really got me laughing the other night
[2:24:56] <Ozavic> Scat play =/= pig play, but the two have intersection
[2:24:58] <RamenRiderZ> Pat fell in the toilet
[2:24:59] <%BinaryFireball> because it gets messy
[2:25:02] <mgotacon> Rolling around in your own filth maybe?

[2:25:35] <$RealThiele> there is no bottom to our drip
[2:25:36] <%Zeroblazex> Is that done in their own home? Outside? A studio?
[2:25:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Crinkling is when you wear an adult diaper.
[2:25:42] <%BinaryFireball> no he's meditating
[2:25:43] <+Huskylluvr> ever think about how monkeys/apes love playing with their own shit. and how humans also do that sometimes
[2:25:44] <%Zeroblazex> Pat is unloading

[2:30:50] <%W1nterTitan> Why we change the overlay?

[2:34:54] <Broken_Sonex> Woolie is.......doing fine as a coach.
[2:34:55] <alroy900> it was pat's plan to overtake woolies body through crazy talk
[2:34:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Bring Me To Life and Crazy Talk are the same type of Stand

[2:35:03] <Sulliman34> CRAZY TALK REQUIEM SPREADS TO ALLIED STANDS
[2:35:03] <%AzureGale> Rocky is in this game, what?
[2:35:07] <%AkronymCLT> How did you finally trick Woolie into looling at your back?
[2:35:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Karen you can't just blow up Wal-Mart!
[2:35:09] <ravioli_ronin> Is Woolie telling Reggie to drop his shield you know what I mean?
[2:35:10] <%Zeroblazex> While we’re here I need to vent
[2:35:10] <%Alazull> Paige is Pat's Requiem
[2:35:15] <Ozavic> Karen commits a warcrime
[2:35:19] <%Zeroblazex> That tower knight fight was..a little rough
[2:35:22] <%orcstr16> Crazy talk requim will one day make the whole world wrong. This may, in fact, cause pat to be RIGHT sometimes. That's CRAZY
[2:35:22] <%walternatorz> can we quarantine woolie?
[2:35:25] <%Undenizen> how the hell could this asteroid field EVER exist if it's that unstable?
[2:35:25] <%Alazull> Cray Talk: All The Things She Said
[2:35:26] <%dekkitout> Cut to next week where Pat assimilates Woolie's body from the neck down
[2:35:26] <DickieWoodsmall_279> unless you just activated it thus taking it back
[2:35:29] <%baka_sugoi> pat the anti stand user
[2:35:37] <RamenRiderZ> Crazy Talk affects the others because Pat is an *INFLUENCER*
[2:35:41] <+krispen_wa> Ka'Ren NEVER killed anyone

[2:35:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Undenizen The asteroid field is the result of an explosion that already happened on the planet.
[2:35:56] <%chiazam> Pat no
[2:35:56] <%BinaryFireball> do it

[2:36:08] <%AzureGale> The STFU option
[2:36:08] <%Maids4lyfe> YES
[2:36:09] <%dekkitout> Response: Apathy
[2:36:09] <Ozavic> @abelincoln_catpuncher Atton is legit funny IMO

[2:36:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah you idiot
[2:36:33] <ravioli_ronin> Lmao just play the whole game as beginning Cloud
[2:36:37] <+krispen_wa> Her "wound" pains her
[2:36:42] <%chiazam> THATS WHAT IT ALWAYS DOES
[2:36:44] <%Undenizen> @Too_Much_Nukie no i know, but this is a universe where doors can be operated by guns. that place should have blown up in 5 seconds.
[2:36:44] <%AzureGale> What a shame
[2:36:45] <PinkSocks> Kreia just standing
[2:36:52] <%MechArch> she just standing back there
[2:36:53] <%brickwall35> of course it's just skips dumb dumb
[2:36:53] <huskarl_zap> now for the other tutorial world
[2:36:54] <+Soliloquy123> The problem is options like that never get funny responses, just the "Conversation over" part of the flowchart
[2:36:56] <MassConnect> you missed an opportunity to dunk on T3
[2:36:58] <DickieWoodsmall_279> isn't it weird how Kreia and Atton have the same dynamic as Theresa and Hammer from Fable and the VA is the same
[2:37:00] <RamenRiderZ> "Granny please"
[2:37:03] <mgotacon> @Zeroblazex Is was when they were doing their run for Dex Weapons on 4-1
[2:37:06] <%dekkitout> That line reads different knowing Atton
[2:37:06] <Ozavic> Just standing in the background
[2:37:14] <%SirGO0SE> kick em in the mynocks
[2:37:20] <dinnydanny777> Ok I looked up Kreia's image on IMDB and there's an image of Sean Connery in a mankini LUL
[2:37:22] <%AzureGale> Yeayeayeayeyaeay
[2:37:28] <Broken_Sonex> BUT T3 IS COOL
[2:37:29] <%chiazam> the bottom answer is always, fuck off I don't care about any of these conversations
[2:37:33] <dinnydanny777> Actor not image my brain is dumb today*
[2:37:33] <owazowski> LUL LUL LUL
[2:37:33] <+krispen_wa> Theresa's VA ain't Kreia
[2:37:34] <Ozavic> @dekkitout Good RPGs should be played twice
[2:37:39] <GarbageQueenEllie> "Boy, that droid sure is making a lot of noise." (Kicks T3)
[2:37:44] <%BinaryFireball> T2 was better
[2:37:47] <Broken_Sonex> YOU HATE HIM BECAUSE HE'S YOU
[2:37:50] <%Zeroblazex> @mgotacon nice, think I stopped right before they were heading there ‘Preciate ya

[2:39:16] <+krispen_wa> hmmm, watching a DS playthrough isn't as fun when you aren't personally killing the orphans. might have to start a new KOTOR II playthrough myself to kill some Orphans
[2:39:18] <%AzureGale> I wanna be sedated
[2:39:24] <subjectg> which is a shame, because she’s good
[2:39:35] <DickieWoodsmall_279> but they sound the same, and the character is also exactly the same
[2:39:39] <%dekkitout> The adults are talking T3
[2:39:42] <Rawklobstah88> Today's a somewhat better day, I think.

[2:46:13] <PanicSwytch> Become the most karen a karen can ever karen
[2:46:14] <%threeheadedwalrus> eh we all know the story
[2:46:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It doesn't "derail" it but it definitely changes the trajectory to be something else.
[2:46:18] <%AgniBrandt> Wait, so you're making Vaan?
[2:46:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> that's why Woolie only went with a little evil. As a treat
[2:46:27] <RamenRiderZ> Apathy is death
[2:46:31] <%BigCoffee> The game should never have let you be dark side
[2:46:31] <%BinaryFireball> ah game design
[2:46:34] <+megaman_sentinel> yep
[2:46:34] <%MidnightBurst12> yep
[2:46:39] <%BigCoffee> kotor 1 and 2 should just be light side
[2:46:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Spoilers: Apathy isn't evil.
[2:46:45] <%mikessdd> Yeah whether Light or Dark the game is constantly going. But why though?
[2:46:46] <olm46> The game denied me content because I wanted nuance...
[2:46:48] <%chiazam> Being grey in this game is fun as shit
[2:46:49] <%Zeroblazex> Wasn’t implemented well at all
[2:46:53] <Broken_Sonex> That's why V created the Light Later system
[2:46:55] <%dekkitout> Balancing the books do be a struggle
[2:46:55] <%Zeroblazex> But again 14 months
[2:46:59] <%Blank9> my favorite part of the game is how much the party just hates each other
[2:47:00] <Teras_ode> who might that be 🤔
[2:47:10] <%orcstr16> If you act like an apathetic dick, the game HATES you with a burning passion. It's fantastic.
[2:47:18] <%SirGO0SE> @BigCoffee youre hardly playing a roll then. and since the gameplay itself is piss easy, whatd be the point? idk
[2:47:21] <Broken_Sonex> I feel bad for every nice girl named Karen.
[2:47:23] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There's ways to go light or dark and have grandma be proud of your choices.
[2:47:24] <PinkSocks> It does suck that that one part is locked away if you're not an extreme
[2:47:25] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> holy shit, does dark side corruption affect Karen's hair band too?
[2:47:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> But for dark side it requires not going pure dark.
[2:47:39] <%manwhoisacat> manwhoisacat subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:47:41] <Teras_ode> we phantom pain now
[2:47:42] <%BinaryFireball> you must invest your soul and body into an ideology
[2:47:42] <%Fooguwu> force ghosts and shit pat
[2:47:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Force powers yo
[2:47:44] <%Ranryu692> the open wound
[2:47:44] <%BinaryFireball> or suffer
[2:47:45] <CrimsonFox777> Yes, she can grow a new one.
[2:47:45] <+pally_din> She wants the stump
[2:47:45] <%Maids4lyfe> robot hands
[2:47:47] <+tpizle> Karen Sith Lord is mighty scary monkaS
[2:47:49] <bubbli97> they got robo hands though
[2:47:50] <%nobleclonetrooper> It just comes off as less authentic. It's like your character is from a 80s serial with a mustache twirling villain. It doesn't feel like Star Wars.
[2:47:50] <%chiazam> Can you no longer equip stuff in her left hand?
[2:47:51] <%dekkitout> You can get replacement limbs- it's Star Wars
[2:47:54] <%Ynkubus_> You dont know that
[2:47:54] <+TomDanksEGOT> FORCE HAND!
[2:47:57] <+Ryuuken1789> She can get a cool robot hand! PogChamp
[2:47:58] <%AkronymCLT> Your hand comes off?
[2:48:00] <%Zeroblazex> She’ll just feel shit thru yours
[2:48:04] <chhdez> Ribs grow back, right?
[2:48:06] <Clundy> With Force Ghost Arm
[2:48:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> She does figure out that whole tele-wielding technique
[2:48:09] <%dekkitout> Even clone limbs if you got the money
[2:48:09] <Clundy> Sith*
[2:48:10] <%TheMattman1313> just force-wield the lightsaber you'd have in that hand anyway
[2:48:13] <%BinaryFireball> yoshimitsu hand???
[2:48:16] <%Blank9> kreia can eat it you are a war veteran
[2:48:19] <mgotacon> More intense than your arm being cut off?
[2:48:19] <+Kurt_0> Yes
[2:48:20] <%BinaryFireball> can she helicopter now?
[2:48:20] <%Zeroblazex> When you wipe with your left hand , so does she
[2:48:25] <+Kurt_0> Force
[2:48:26] <Teras_ode> the sass LUL
[2:48:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> Losing the hand helped her find her ghost hands
[2:48:35] <%Maids4lyfe> PAT NO
[2:48:37] <RamenRiderZ> Carbonara Hand
[2:48:37] <DickieWoodsmall_279> would you cum twice?
[2:48:38] <jtsoppy137> pat
[2:48:39] <+gaemjurnalist> new sith power unlocked: hand re-growth
[2:48:41] <+pally_din> double sex
[2:48:41] <Broken_Sonex> I WONDER.....
[2:48:41] <mgotacon> Mass Defect
[2:48:43] <%Fooguwu> just kidding... unless?
[2:48:46] <%SGrim> 4
[2:48:47] <%AzureGale> Follow Fate rules
[2:48:48] <%MidnightBurst12> hell yeah
[2:48:48] <%dekkitout> Something something feeedback in a tank
[2:48:53] <+pally_din> Literally sex 2
[2:48:55] <%AzureGale> Mana transfer
[2:48:56] <%BinaryFireball> suck it wrinkle bags
[2:49:03] <%SirGO0SE> explain how do scissor work
[2:49:03] <PinkSocks> Imagine being tired to Karen
[2:49:09] <DickieWoodsmall_279> would you cum two times or just twice as hard?
[2:49:11] <+Huskylluvr> a karen statement at best
[2:49:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> so when I smash Atton, you're smashing him too? Nice
[2:49:13] <%Maids4lyfe> haha you're bonded to bean lady
[2:49:15] <%za7az> "I DEMAND to speak to the manager!"
[2:49:20] <dinnydanny777> So what happens if you don't become a Jedi or a Sith and just play a neutral random gunman
[2:49:22] <%Maids4lyfe> omg you're right
[2:49:23] <jtsoppy137> yep
[2:49:24] <%wibbwobbler> yuuuup
[2:49:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Force bonds did exist before this game in the EU.
[2:49:31] <DickieWoodsmall_279> if you cum at the same time would it be more intense or would they cancel out
[2:49:35] <%Maids4lyfe> Last Jedi is just a shitty remake of Kotor 2
[2:49:36] <%AzureGale> Hawt
[2:49:44] <+Huskylluvr> anti cum
[2:49:47] <%Blank9> you'll be a jedi no matter what, even if you gun
[2:49:53] <%dekkitout> Nothing is new for Star Wars, there's probably 3 other forms of time travel if I look hard enough
[2:49:54] <dinnydanny777> @dickiewoodsmall_279 If you fuck would you both feel it?
[2:49:57] <Broken_Sonex> "Suck it Wrinkles." - Darth Kay'Ran
[2:50:04] <Teras_ode> it's as if they ripped off things from the good EU stuff but without consturcting a good story around those elements
[2:50:09] <+gaemjurnalist> yeah but instead of getting tied to a hot guy you get tied to a grumpy old hag
[2:50:13] <HealingMind> does dark side actually get healing, or was palpatine bullshitting?
[2:50:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Clown from Ace Combat 7's voice actor passed away today
[2:50:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I TOLD OYU
[2:50:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> YOU*
[2:50:19] <MassConnect> remember when people complained about force powers that were in these games?
[2:50:20] <%dekkitout> @DickieWoodsmall_279 Cyberpunk 2077 answers that Kappa
[2:50:21] <%BinaryFireball> Karen's hair band was ALWAYS evil
[2:50:21] <+gaemjurnalist> therefore last jedi is better
[2:50:22] <%Nekros4442> Dont your inner clothes become evil too?
[2:50:26] <%Ranryu692> it looks spikier
[2:50:26] <%BinaryFireball> its a hair band
[2:50:30] <%BinaryFireball> bluetooth hairband
[2:50:34] <+TomDanksEGOT> it totally flipped you off pat!
[2:50:40] <%nobleclonetrooper> @HealingMind It gets Drain Life which is bassically what Palps did.
[2:50:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it has skull crossbones on it
[2:50:48] <+Huskylluvr> @gaemjurnalist hot?
[2:50:50] <Broken_Sonex> And of course it's a fucking scrunchy
[2:50:52] <DickieWoodsmall_279> if karen fucked atton would kreia just have to deal with it?
[2:50:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Guys V's voice actor Brad Venable is dead.
[2:50:59] <RamenRiderZ> Alignment Adaptive Hairband
[2:51:21] <+Huskylluvr> @too_much_nukie when did that happen?
[2:51:23] <%luftraumm1> its kind of what aang did to Ozai
[2:51:25] <%BinaryFireball> the first gen of alignment rpgs were....
[2:51:27] <Manipulator98> he was griffons va
[2:51:28] <%BinaryFireball> well
[2:51:28] <%dekkitout> @DickieWoodsmall_279 I guess that's why she constantly tells you to keep it in your pants
[2:51:35] <$Afterman_> It's so fucking sad to see how batshit crazy Reuben Langdon is
[2:51:35] <HealingMind> @nobleclonetrooper ah, okay. I didn't know they got big drainage stuff. neat.
[2:51:36] <+gaemjurnalist> @Huskylluvr i said what i meant and i meant what i said
[2:51:38] <Manipulator98> not V's
[2:51:46] <DatAsuna> "what they have done"
[2:51:48] <+Kurt_0> That’s a real threat
[2:51:52] <Teras_ode> I'm my own master nowwwww~~ SourPls
[2:51:52] <%wibbwobbler> i think, given their respective budgets, the new trilogy are the worst movies of all time imo
[2:51:55] <%BinaryFireball> ok real question are there any games that actually do alignment well?
[2:52:02] <%AzureGale> THAT PASSIVE AGGRESSION
[2:52:08] <+xemnahort> Tell me he’s dark side af
[2:52:09] <$Afterman_> @BinaryFireball pathfinder kingmaker kinda
[2:52:09] <%ghostofsolomon> Pat why not just kill this person
[2:52:13] <+TomDanksEGOT> Im calling the police on you old lady, this is harrasment
[2:52:17] <star_feline> oh fuck off
[2:52:18] <+megaman_sentinel> other Jedi lol
[2:52:33] <+NateGRS117> hahaha bitterLOL you are my servant now rooKek
[2:52:33] <%BinaryFireball> @Afterman_ oooo thanks, I have that one but I havent gotten too far
[2:52:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> She's totally just tolerating you rn
[2:52:43] <%dekkitout> Echo- drink
[2:52:43] <subjectg> “You will be my Caster, Kreia”
[2:52:50] <%ghostofsolomon> no echoes in space
[2:52:51] <+xemnahort> Darth Karen truly the most insidious of all sith
[2:52:52] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @BinaryFireball no because objective morality isn't real and the dev's bias will always seep through
[2:52:53] <Coystick> Don't be rude to best geandma
[2:52:57] <+megaman_sentinel> u r such a Jedi Granny lol
[2:53:02] <$Afterman_> @BinaryFireball it is very fun just go into it with an open mind, and if needed make the kingdom building shit easy via options
[2:53:16] <Teras_ode> maybe the real force was the friends we made along the way Kappa
[2:53:18] <%za7az> Liberating?
[2:53:19] <mgotacon> Space Babushka
[2:53:19] <%BinaryFireball> i love kingdom building shit
[2:53:24] <$FilthyHippie> moocha chaka paka
[2:53:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> a true Karen
[2:53:26] <Broken_Sonex> Did Woolie ever take the time to change his layout so we could see the dialog?
[2:53:30] <DickieWoodsmall_279> remember that part in RDR2 where you can gain honor by murdering an unarmed old man because he used to be a slave catcher?
[2:53:31] <owleyet> don't be mean to old ladies who don't care about getting hands cut off is my play style
[2:53:38] <%MidnightBurst12> lame
[2:53:41] <+Ryuuken1789> But it's not you Pat... It's KAREN shotoEww
[2:53:42] <%TinyLittleDancer> It seems like they still let basically everything slide in the name of plot
[2:53:43] <Teras_ode> drink
[2:53:44] <%Blank9> more games need to just let you not give a fuck
[2:53:49] <%BinaryFireball> @DickieWoodsmall_279 truth but I think you can still make a decent system even if there are biases one way or the other
[2:53:57] <$Afterman_> @BinaryFireball i will give you a hint for getting the good ending: research curses. that is all i will say. and dont let the time limit on some quests scare you, you generally have plenty of time to do what you want
[2:54:05] <%BinaryFireball> thicc plot
[2:54:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> did karen's hair tie get more goth?
[2:54:20] <+Huskylluvr> its sad that griffons va died cri
[2:54:27] <%dekkitout> Aw man, that first Jedi schism was something else
[2:54:29] <%BinaryFireball> @Afterman_ I like curses, damn you for selling me hard
[2:54:32] <%FacetiousAF> jedi civil war sounds pretty poggers
[2:54:43] <$Afterman_> @Huskylluvr i know, i was super sad when i found out. he was so great as grifofn
[2:54:44] <%TinyLittleDancer> is Karen a goth Karen?
[2:54:53] <mgotacon> good old outer rum
[2:54:55] <%king_wragles> Man, that sounds like the grounds of a cool MMO that would die almost immediately if it didn't have a dedicated machine with a clear plan!
[2:54:55] <%BinaryFireball> nah
[2:54:56] <mgotacon> rim*
[2:54:59] <%BinaryFireball> not gothy enough
[2:55:08] <%king_wragles> *dedicated team
[2:55:24] <chhdez> Jedi Capn America and Jedi Black Panther
[2:55:31] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> that's totally a Hot Topic hair scrunchy
[2:55:31] <$Afterman_> @BinaryFireball you will def love the game i think. i would also recommend looking up some mods for extra portrait options for ur characters
[2:55:37] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @king_wragles yeah like some kind of long-term 10-year plan or...I don't know, road map?
[2:55:38] <mgotacon> Foreshadowing???
[2:55:44] <%jessyg920> @Teras_ode What was the drinking game for this? I don't remember.
[2:55:52] <$Afterman_> @BinaryFireball personally i love rogue classes and the knife master is strong AF
[2:55:56] <%hrbeck_> How do we give karen a big ass?
[2:56:03] <%cylish> I love the concept of sith dedicated to the dark side and not necessarily to being in charge
[2:56:04] <+Huskylluvr> @afterman_ he was in a lot of other games I like too and Im just finding out now :(
[2:56:07] <%BinaryFireball> @Afterman_ I'm gonna mod it so I can role play professor oak
[2:56:12] <Teras_ode> @jessyg920 every time someone says 'echoes' you drink
[2:56:13] <AMUSERNAME> H U N G E R
[2:56:16] <huskarl_zap> already has
[2:56:22] <%dekkitout> Not even force alchemy can help that
[2:56:24] <+megaman_sentinel> so Jedi found real sith an went crazy lol
[2:56:25] <%BinaryFireball> @Afterman_ prof.oak the necromancer
[2:56:27] <$Afterman_> @BinaryFireball there is a beast master class so you can have animals
[2:56:35] <%BinaryFireball> oooo
[2:56:36] <KaitlynnHere> So is there such a thing as a grey sith?
[2:56:41] <%jessyg920> @Teras_ode Got it. Let's do this!
[2:56:44] <Broken_Sonex> @hrbeck_ Actually the female models in this game have missive dump trucks
[2:56:45] <$Afterman_> @Huskylluvr DMC5 was the first time I ever heard him, now i wanna check out his other work, any suggestions?
[2:57:04] <mgotacon> I remember reading the old Star Wars novels, pity Disney dumped the Expanded Universe. Although the fist of Darth Vader was dogshit.
[2:57:05] <%dekkitout> Ventress and Maul post Clone Wars @KaitlynnHere
[2:57:11] <Teras_ode> @jessyg920 Good luck!
[2:57:14] <%hrbeck_> Finally
[2:57:19] <star_feline> "Hey I know I went to Iraq in 2005 but can you tell me about the Iraq War?"
[2:57:23] <DickieWoodsmall_279> man I cna't wait for disney to completely fucking destroy the canon verison of kotor
[2:57:52] <%wibbwobbler> revan is such a cool naaaame
[2:57:57] <+megaman_sentinel> i enjoyed the rule of two
[2:57:57] <Teras_ode> rad af man
[2:57:59] <mgotacon> Shit was lit
[2:58:02] <%BinaryFireball> starwars ended long ago for me, the new stuff is just fanfic
[2:58:05] <dinnydanny777> Are the Sith and the Jedi both cults?
[2:58:09] <%BinaryFireball> makes it more enjoyable
[2:58:12] <subjectg> if anything, what will happen is that kotor 1 will get some play, while they’ll just silently skip over 2’s content
[2:58:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Afterman_ I gotta say, I was only tangentially watching your conversation but that was enough to sell me on the game too. LUL
[2:58:16] <+Huskylluvr> @afterman_ itd be best to check his imdb page. the only roles I know him from are minor
[2:58:17] <%MidnightBurst12> malachor was fucked
[2:58:21] <KaitlynnHere> I smoked so much weed Kreia, you don’t even know
[2:58:22] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Considering the Mandolorians were using a blockade to bait out the Jedi to war, I could see Kae'ryn getting involved because it was inconveniencing her
[2:58:27] <$Afterman_> @BinaryFireball have you seen the clone wars cartoon? if not def watch it, it is the best star wars media
[2:58:28] <DickieWoodsmall_279> I never played kotor 1 as a female, how do they explain revan's spontaneous lack of penis?
[2:58:30] <dinnydanny777> Would Star Wars be better off putting people who aren't religious fanatics in charge of stuff come to think of it LUL
[2:58:42] <Teras_ode> @dinnydanny777 a big YES
[2:58:47] <Broken_Sonex> I wish Disney stopped Star Wars-ing
[2:58:48] <$Afterman_> @Valentinius_Anodyne lmaoo. well its a great crpg. i couldnt recommend it enough.
[2:58:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Hey, if you think force users suck. You should play an Imperial Agent in TOR
[2:58:51] <%dekkitout> Sith is pretty culty- one time a Sith emperor convinced a planet's inhabitants to off themselves
[2:58:51] <%BinaryFireball> @Afterman_ i hear that one is super good!
[2:59:03] <+Kurt_0> Did he have drip
[2:59:05] <KaitlynnHere> I wanna see a Star Wars story where a force user struggles with drug addiction
[2:59:15] <$Afterman_> @BinaryFireball it gets good after the first 2 and a half seasons. It has some of the best fights in all of the series
[2:59:17] <subjectg> @dinnydanny777 when you think about it, almost all of the galaxy’s troubles came from the jedi and sith having pow wows
[2:59:25] <+xemnahort> @dickiewoodsmall_279 there’s nothing to contradict revan always being female since revan is a gender less name
[2:59:26] <$Afterman_> @Huskylluvr ill check it out ty
[2:59:38] <%BinaryFireball> oh really the best fights eh?
[2:59:40] <Clundy> Sith technically deal with power addiction
[2:59:52] <$Afterman_> @xemnahort well i think the devs said canon wise revan is male and the exile is female
[2:59:55] <mgotacon> This plot vs modern bioware rpgs...
[2:59:57] <Teras_ode> wha'happun
[3:00:09] <$Afterman_> @BinaryFireball yea. if you dont mind spoilers i can link you 2 of my all time favorites
[3:00:12] <+xemnahort> @afterman_ I meant in the games themselves
[3:00:18] <%dekkitout> Da wur
[3:00:21] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @xemnahort but don't they specifically refer to revan as male during flashbacks and shit?
[3:00:23] <$Afterman_> @xemnahort ah fair enough
[3:00:28] <%BinaryFireball> @Afterman_ hit me daddy
[3:00:35] <+xemnahort> @dickiewoodsmall_279 nope
[3:00:35] <%Alazull> Do you fuck wit de war?
[3:00:35] <Broken_Sonex> He's off somewhere being poorly written
[3:00:38] <%vaporousTippler> Canon Revan kinda looks like Keanu Reeves.
[3:00:40] <%Blank9> I ignore the dev canon because man, the stuff set after this in TOR sucks
[3:00:47] <%wibbwobbler> from a certain point of view perhaps
[3:00:47] <subjectg> @xemnahort the only piece of definitive evidence would be satele shan in the mmo, if that counts
[3:00:50] <%AzureGale> KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM
[3:00:54] <notenoughgirls> it's insane that this game came out before episode 3
[3:01:02] <mgotacon> EVEN THE YOUNGLINGS
[3:01:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Why ask to see the manager when I can kill everyone who can become a manager
[3:01:09] <Huntercd> The Republic sucks
[3:01:20] <%dekkitout> Especially the younglings
[3:01:21] <%Alazull> Especially the younglings
[3:01:21] <%twistedj3ster> especially the younglings
[3:01:25] <%TheMattman1313> "stagnation is death"
[3:01:26] <Broken_Sonex> Holy shit Revan DOES look like Keanu Reeves......
[3:01:26] <+xemnahort> @dickiewoodsmall_279 well in 2 I think there are some lines that use male pronouns despite you choosing female but those are clearly mistakes
[3:01:30] <mgotacon> Oof
[3:01:35] <$Afterman_> @BinaryFireball messaged them to u
[3:01:38] <DickieWoodsmall_279> isn't there a rumor that the reason ewan turns his head during that line is because he couldn't say it without smiling?
[3:01:42] <Ausk> the kid from the youngling scene did an interview, apparently he steps back in that scene cause Hayden suddenly shooted "BOO" at him
[3:01:42] <Teras_ode> nice combo guys LUL
[3:01:47] <dinnydanny777> Burn it all down I say
[3:01:48] <GarbageQueenEllie> haha get rekt
[3:01:51] <%dekkitout> Their supple skin is quite flammable
[3:01:53] <mgotacon> Are the optics good on this child burning.
[3:01:56] <ShichiNoBushi> ESPECIALLY the younglings.
[3:01:57] <dinnydanny777> "Burn what down?" "Space"
[3:02:00] <%Blank9> HEY... you doing some cool ass shit that's what you doing
[3:02:07] <$DocMadfox> Yeah, fuck them kids! Shit, phrasing.
[3:02:09] <%blankwaffle> Maga kae'ryn
[3:02:10] <+Kurt_0> Not the youngalingos
[3:02:14] <%BinaryFireball> man like these long convos must make their legs tired, jedi dont like to sit down and chill
[3:02:21] <PinkSocks> YEP
[3:02:22] <%dekkitout> Tons
[3:02:22] <%TheMattman1313> "kindling"-garten
[3:02:25] <+DakotaMacDoodle> yes
[3:02:25] <mgotacon> YES
[3:02:27] <+RedKazoo> true
[3:02:28] <jtsoppy137> yeah
[3:02:31] <%BTR_NOODLE> it does
[3:02:31] <Teras_ode> crazy isn't it?
[3:02:31] <$DocMadfox> Yeah basically
[3:02:33] <%twistedj3ster> yeah just about
[3:02:34] <dinnydanny777> Yeah there's more in the comics too
[3:02:35] <subjectg> pretty much
[3:02:35] <%SirGO0SE> its like, half an episode of Star Trek
[3:02:37] <%orcstr16> True facts
[3:02:39] <MassConnect> yeah, it feels longer than Peragus
[3:02:43] <+Huskylluvr> thats not hard but yeah
[3:02:43] <%MidnightBurst12> that'a what kills me about this series
[3:02:43] <%FacetiousAF> that's a DAMN SHAME isn't it
[3:02:44] <%Blank9> yeah but uhhhh what about trade tariffs
[3:02:44] <+zeraux_> love is a battlefield?
[3:02:48] <DickieWoodsmall_279> SW is a weird franchise where the big budget stuff is shit and the supplementary material is the only top-tier on offer
[3:02:48] <%wibbwobbler> actually yes
[3:02:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it also a story beforehand to bounce off of.
[3:02:51] <+xemnahort> @subjectg well swtor removes any sort of ambiguity as to the canon genders of revan or the exile but in terms of KOTOR 1 and 2 there is nothing to suggest a canon gender
[3:02:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> This one goes great with the one where Visas talks about Kataar
[3:02:55] <%dekkitout> THIS, power gap, Maul v Ashoka, everything else
[3:02:55] <%jessyg920> My girlfriend just asked me why is Pat drunk and screaming about burning children.
[3:02:55] <dinnydanny777> I liked the comics with the two Imperial soldiers I forget what it was called
[3:02:57] <+Kaiserzelcor> What's funny is only the 8th movie even to bother to try and approach the themes of this game
[3:02:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> also has*
[3:03:04] <+Kaiserzelcor> tried*
[3:03:05] <%MidnightBurst12> it could be so good, but fuck it tho
[3:03:06] <PinkSocks> and this is 1 of like 30 Kreia conversations
[3:03:13] <ravioli_ronin> Fr; the fact that they had all this EU content and didn’t bother to borrow from ANY of it for the sequels js actually insane
[3:03:14] <AEnemyStandUser> well to be fair if you asked what Star Wars means to someone you're going to get a different answer from everybody
[3:03:20] <Teras_ode> DUU DUU DUUUUN
[3:03:21] <KaiserMario> "Have you ever been in a cockpit, billy?" "Have you ever seen a grown man naked?"
[3:03:21] <Broken_Sonex> Man.....it's crazy how all the live action Star Wars stuff kinda sucks.
[3:03:24] <mgotacon> DUUU DUU DUN
[3:03:29] <%MidnightBurst12> evil over influence
[3:03:29] <subjectg> @kaiserzelcor i’d argue they didn’t even try
[3:03:30] <+TomDanksEGOT> EVIL STINGER!
[3:03:38] <$DocMadfox> @xemnahort LucasArts declared the canon genders way before SWTOR.
[3:03:39] <+Huskylluvr> to me, star wars is kylo ren in his goofy shirt
[3:03:41] <%Alazull> Pat's going to get full cancelled by the end of this
[3:03:47] <+TomDanksEGOT> I feel like Karen is Virgils dream girl
[3:03:51] <+Huskylluvr> *shirtless outfit
[3:03:52] <+ithirstforfreddurst> just like in IRL?
[3:03:53] <%BinaryFireball> they should just make a starwars movie where there are only drone characters
[3:03:54] <%za7az> Man why didn't they just copy this plot in the sequel films
[3:03:54] <mgotacon> Abrasive AF
[3:03:55] <%MidnightBurst12> as it should be
[3:03:57] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @ravioli_ronin they've pseudo re-canonized some stuff through retellings
[3:03:57] <+zeraux_> EVIL
[3:03:59] <%blankwaffle> I want the Darkside music to play after I do anything
[3:04:03] <+xemnahort> @patstaresat can’t imagine why you’ve been so nice and understanding so far
[3:04:04] <OldManDeckardCain> should be easy LUL
[3:04:04] <$DocMadfox> So you're roleplaying yourself, Pat? Eeeeey
[3:04:08] <JonnyJonstar> Is pat using mods to play this game? Also does he explain what mods he is using?
[3:04:12] <%dekkitout> Fallen Order tries to go this tangent, but it doesn't have any weight
[3:04:19] <leinadtonu> I don't get it, why not just hire these guys to write you a movie or tv show?
[3:04:29] <%Xevtes> aww
[3:04:30] <+Huskylluvr> @tomdanksegot Virgil and Karen would be a power couple
[3:04:31] <mgotacon> :<
[3:04:43] <+Kaiserzelcor> @subjectg It's the only movie that genuinely told the audience that everything's not so cut and try. And then backpedalled to appease it's stupid as shit fans
[3:04:45] <+xemnahort> @docmadfox I am specifically referring to in game stuff
[3:05:05] <dinnydanny777> I like how Kylo Ren is shirtless in Episode 7 and they don't even explain why he takes his shirt off LUL
[3:05:06] <ravioli_ronin> @leinadtonu nah we gotta crank those movies out ASAP to cash in on the star war
[3:05:11] <+AnthraxJohnson> Electronic farting intensifies
[3:05:14] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @Huskylluvr it's virgel with an E dumbass
[3:05:17] <DickieWoodsmall_279> shit
[3:05:17] <dinnydanny777> It's just funny to me LUL
[3:05:31] <subjectg> @kaiserzelcor argues that everything’s not so cut and dry while ending on the most black and white shit ever, i’d call that not trying
[3:05:33] <KaitlynnHere> Punch him in his lenses socket
[3:06:02] <+Kaiserzelcor> @subjectg I'd thank Disney for that
[3:06:08] <%dekkitout> T3: tajWHY
[3:06:09] <%Ynkubus_> D:
[3:06:09] <Teras_ode> okay FeelsBadMan
[3:06:11] <%twistedj3ster> wow, that was harsh even for you
[3:06:12] <+Huskylluvr> @dickiewoodsmall_279 I feel like im missing a joke
[3:06:13] <%AzureGale> Harsh, dude
[3:06:14] <%vexion_smh> So mean LUL
[3:06:17] <owleyet> don't be mean to the bot mastergirTired mastergirTired
[3:06:21] <MassConnect> lose influence with the workbench
[3:06:22] <%Broand> so who is pat gonna be cool with
[3:06:29] <mgotacon> Massive crits
[3:06:30] <leinadtonu> that's so mean BibleThump
[3:06:33] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt You sound like your ten seconds off of coming up with a slur for droids
[3:06:33] <KaitlynnHere> @owleyet it deserves it
[3:06:40] <Clundy> @broand nobody LUL
[3:06:42] <%dekkitout> Tig ol critties
[3:06:43] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @Huskylluvr that's okay it wasn't very funny anyway
[3:06:45] <%Broand> oh that explains it
[3:06:46] <%twistedj3ster> Pat's lightsabers will hate him
[3:06:49] <%W1nterTitan> My son...
[3:06:52] <Badgerconda_> look how they massacred my boy!
[3:06:53] <%baka_sugoi> child
[3:06:55] <+xemnahort> Doesn’t this game treat influence like da2 in that you can get influence checks for equivalent negative influence?
[3:06:56] <%FacetiousAF> hear me out: everyone hates you EXCEPT hk
[3:06:57] <Teras_ode> compronents
[3:07:00] <%NovaKnightmare> @PatStaresAt use cheats to give urself all the stuff now
[3:07:04] <mgotacon> So... the whole droid then?
[3:07:13] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> HK BEST BOI
[3:07:16] <%TheMattman1313> Take the rest from T3
[3:07:29] <%jessyg920> yeah, I'm pretty sure we were just looking at his chassis
[3:07:30] <+Huskylluvr> demolish T3
[3:07:34] <+xemnahort> @novaknightmare I can’t even imagine hk from the start
[3:07:34] <%NovaKnightmare> Nah
[3:07:36] <%DeadManProp> My son, the day you were born, the very forests of Lordaeron whispered the name HK
[3:07:37] <DickieWoodsmall_279> woah dude this blue spinning texture tube is trippy as hell
[3:07:39] <subjectg> @xemnahort ye pretty much
[3:07:40] <%NovaKnightmare> it'd be funny tho
[3:07:42] <mgotacon> *Obligitory Dr Who reference*
[3:07:52] <%CatastropheCorvid> Reactions, but IIRC nothing specific
[3:07:54] <%FacetiousAF> that bitch ages like milk Kappa
[3:07:58] <subjectg> It’s not like Legion, sadly
[3:08:01] <Nix_Abyss> da air
[3:08:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He's air-typing
[3:08:06] <%twistedj3ster> he's using the force
[3:08:07] <%Nekros4442> What are you typing on Atton
[3:08:07] <%wibbwobbler> ooh boy
[3:08:08] <dinnydanny777> Finished game Kappa
[3:08:09] <%shurtal> Let him play at being pilot
[3:08:13] <%dekkitout> He WOULD know that
[3:08:14] <%AzureGale> gdi
[3:08:15] <%GarbageNirvana> He's doing improv
[3:08:19] <mgotacon> GILF
[3:08:20] <+Huskylluvr> hes not typing hes free styling
[3:08:25] <%DemonOfSalt> Jokes on us, Atton is just air-typing for the same reason he plays Pazaak.
[3:08:26] <KaitlynnHere> Tell him he’s an idiot
[3:08:27] <dinnydanny777> Spacing huh
[3:08:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's canon that Kreia was beautiful when she was young.
[3:08:32] <Daxalog> Red sector?
[3:08:32] <+canseesea> "If we had a decent navicomputer, I'd be typing on it here like this"
[3:08:36] <leinadtonu> I played this ages ago, but isn't this the game where if you are an asshole everyone becomes assholes too?
[3:08:51] <dinnydanny777> "Spacing" implies that it's something so common in this universe that it has a name
[3:08:53] <Teras_ode> not gilf YET Kappa
[3:09:06] <%snow_bush> WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME YOUNG MAN?
[3:09:06] <dinnydanny777> People routinely yeeted out of space ships midflight
[3:09:10] <+xemnahort> Atton just likes to mime typing, it makes him feel useful
[3:09:15] <Teras_ode> milf perhaps
[3:09:26] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @Too_Much_Nukie it's also canon that the gross corpse guy wants to nut inside your character
[3:09:37] <mgotacon> Cool
[3:09:40] <+Huskylluvr> does his hair have physics?
[3:09:43] <KaitlynnHere> Crusty nut
[3:10:01] <mgotacon> Crunchy nut cornflakes
[3:10:14] <Broken_Sonex> Crusty crusty nut.....
[3:10:19] <%MisterTylerrr> DROID RACIST
[3:10:22] <Ausk> foreshadowing
[3:10:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @DickieWoodsmall_279 Only if you're female, but yes.
[3:10:22] <KaitlynnHere> @dickiewoodsmall_279 I bet it comes out like curdled milk
[3:10:30] <highfivesquash> pat yell penis into your ps5 it can hear you
[3:10:30] <%TECHNO_OUTLAW> TECHNO_OUTLAW subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months! 
[3:10:33] <%dekkitout> I think it'd be curdled, not crusty
[3:10:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And it's canon that Atris loves the Exile, regardless of the Exile's gender.
[3:10:43] <%SirGO0SE> DansGame
[3:10:45] <highfivesquash> the more you yell penis at your new ps5 the faster it goes -sony
[3:10:46] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @Too_Much_Nukie you are female canonically
[3:10:46] <+Huskylluvr> dick cheese
[3:10:48] <highfivesquash> -kaz hirai
[3:10:52] <jtsoppy137> WHAT COLOR PAT
[3:10:59] <$DocMadfox> "If you don't memory wipe a droid, the start to think they're people."
[3:11:00] <s1rcuit> I love that the only thing stopping the Matrix from happening in this universe is pc maintenance
[3:11:07] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @DickieWoodsmall_279 And named Meetra Surik, I know.
[3:11:09] <%FacetiousAF> can you mod it to be a darksaber??
[3:11:22] <+canseesea> If you don't beat your slave every now and then they start to think they can do anything
[3:11:23] <Teras_ode> no Kappa
[3:11:25] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can.
[3:11:29] <pognotgop> Text is so small
[3:11:30] <%dekkitout> So red, that it bled
[3:11:40] <owleyet> sozanHYPERS party
[3:11:40] <Meekest> "It wasn't red, was it" I mean actually
[3:11:43] <%wombatlime> Not evil red
[3:11:49] <Broken_Sonex> @Too_Much_Nukie It kinda sucks if that means Handmaiden ain't canon
[3:11:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> But Paaaaaat that's your OLD lightsaber.
[3:11:50] <mgotacon> Text is small to stop cut-off.
[3:11:51] <KaitlynnHere> Red Jedi
[3:11:55] <%JJCheeker> i <3 kotor
[3:11:58] <%RetroCop87> that conversation was fun
[3:12:07] <mgotacon> Really?
[3:12:11] <ShichiNoBushi> What are you typing on, Atton?
[3:12:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Broken_Sonex She is canon tho. In canon Handmaiden still comes along for the ride.
[3:12:23] <DickieWoodsmall_279> pat how do you feel about Darth Sion wanting to bust a curdled nut inside you?
[3:12:23] <owleyet> doesnt it scale with UI or something weird
[3:12:23] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt There is. But it looks like garbage if you do.
[3:12:24] <mgotacon> I suppose odler resolutions that text would be bigger.
[3:12:25] <%za7az> @wombatlime I thought red indicated the stone was taken by force and corrupted
[3:12:28] <mgotacon> older*
[3:12:28] <%RetroCop87> what are you playing on, a PC for ants!?
[3:12:30] <+Huskylluvr> oh thank god I thought I was blind. text is so tiny
[3:12:32] <KaitlynnHere> I’m sure the Jedi council saw your red lightsaber and thought “yup. Nothing wrong there”
[3:12:35] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can use a couple mods to make the game as close to canon as possible.
[3:12:39] <subjectg> the one thing that sucks about not having handmaiden is you lose out on one of the best feats in the game
[3:12:55] <dinnydanny777> I like that if you pick the Red option in that conversation Atton doesn't even acknowledge it
[3:12:56] <ShichiNoBushi> Does the text just look smaller because of your larger TV?
[3:13:18] <Broken_Sonex> @Too_Much_Nukie Well, regardless, I prefer male Exile
[3:13:21] <%dekkitout> ThankEgg
[3:13:23] <mgotacon> Higher res means if the ui isn't set to scale to that res it'll be small af.
[3:13:24] <%CrowbarFacelift> \o/
[3:13:24] <%za7az> PogChamp
[3:13:24] <%Deano8817> did we though?
[3:13:25] <%BinaryFireball> what!?!?
[3:13:26] <s1rcuit> roll credits
[3:13:27] <%DeadManProp> I'm spending 2000 chat points on Gengar PokGengar yes
[3:13:28] <%RetroCop87> now Broly will go ssj
[3:13:31] <$DocMadfox> Welcome to Peragus 2.0!
[3:13:35] <DickieWoodsmall_279> WE MADE IT TO TARIS GUYS
[3:13:41] <subjectg> Onto a longer and shittier planet!
[3:13:46] <Nix_Abyss> I got all the items and stuff
[3:13:47] <%FacetiousAF> hmm. PokGengar
[3:13:49] <%FacetiousAF> damn
[3:13:50] <KaitlynnHere> Nothing
[3:13:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Depends on the mod.
[3:13:53] <$RealThiele> pee smells better
[3:13:53] <krin_x> @PatStaresAt I love your dog thats it
[3:13:55] <%Futurecity10> The mod gives you a lightsaber
[3:13:56] <+canseesea> skip peragus mod asks you a few questions and drops a bunch of items in your inventory
[3:13:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You always get the items though.
[3:14:00] <%chiazam> How do you skip Peragus????
[3:14:02] <MassConnect> oh, a mod skip?
[3:14:02] <Broken_Sonex> You get the levels i think
[3:14:02] <%baka_sugoi> KILOL
[3:14:06] <MassConnect> was gonna say you can't
[3:14:09] <subjectg> You lose out on the random loot though
[3:14:10] <KaitlynnHere> You skip it and pick a couple dialogue questions
[3:14:14] <mgotacon> Did we do a terrorism?
[3:14:14] <Nix_Abyss> I never play it so idk what is much the difference other than the items
[3:14:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I don't think you get the influence.
[3:14:29] <%Futurecity10> The mod gives you the influence as well
[3:14:30] <Javi9563> you chose if you want the kreia or atton influence
[3:14:30] <KaitlynnHere> You get influence too
[3:14:39] <+canseesea> The mod I played asked how kreiea and atton like me
[3:14:41] <dinnydanny777> This is the perfect time to ask for the manager
[3:14:43] <%Broand> don't forget the Ka'ren characterization
[3:14:46] <KaitlynnHere> Chat lie
[3:14:48] <%TinyLittleDancer> Karen would choose #1
[3:14:49] <+TomDanksEGOT> Karen would think what she did was right

[3:32:30] <Teras_ode> nice, thanks 👍
[3:32:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> She's obviously manipulative that's not the same thing.
[3:32:36] <+EnergyMax> KOTOR II?? Let's go!!!
[3:32:52] <%Monkeyweed21> Force cummies
[3:33:12] <mgotacon> uwot
[3:33:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> I miss writing quality like in this game. It seems so rare, now.
[3:33:18] <Teras_ode> that's a lot of red
[3:33:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Wait could you give a handjob with the force?
[3:33:22] <SoftLusca> Love to do a star war
[3:33:24] <Broken_Sonex> Screams "Betrayal" every time she uses it
[3:33:29] <DickieWoodsmall_279> if kreia is evil, explain her lignment meter. checkmate
[3:33:31] <mgotacon> forcejob?
[3:33:33] <notsoy> give her all the light side stuff since you're dark side
[3:33:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You don't see fine manipulation often.
[3:33:41] <Teras_ode> @Too_Much_Nukie consult the fanfics
[3:33:42] <subjectg> @too_much_nukie just pushing and pulling, nothing too fancy
[3:33:43] <%MidnightBurst12> @too_much_nukie no reason why you can't
[3:33:46] <Laycas49> They could probably just pull the nut right out of you
[3:33:48] <Clundy> @too_much_nukie You ever see Ghostbusters? It’s like the scene in that...
[3:33:50] <kipperxl> forcepush someones shit in
[3:33:50] <Grandma_Amari> You have to yell at the paperwork first
[3:33:53] <%Puhff> Kreia scream at own ass
[3:33:56] <Broken_Sonex> @Too_Much_Nukie Totally
[3:33:58] <dinnydanny777> @too_much_nukie Force choke takes on a different meaning NotLikeThis
[3:34:12] <subjectg> You can totally use the force to tickle someone’s prostate
[3:34:19] <DickieWoodsmall_279> Force chokejerking has got to be THE BEST
[3:34:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> You could use the "force" on yourself, Jedi probably do that all the time to stay "pure".
[3:34:25] <Teras_ode> from the manager
[3:34:26] <%Ranryu692> security office
[3:34:32] <%justcallmebobplease> The Karen energy Pat's character exudes is pretty darn strong.
[3:34:35] <notenoughgirls> the manager
[3:34:35] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Police area
[3:34:36] <highfivesquash> use the force
[3:34:38] <%dekkitout> We need to unpack Force pegging SeriousSloth
[3:34:38] <Clundy> The Star Wars universe must have a lot more deaths from autoerotic asphyxiation...
[3:34:43] <+EnergyMax> ahh, the post-tutorial section...
[3:34:44] <Broken_Sonex> @mgotacon We call that Dark Later
[3:34:50] <donstylo> Go to the police station and talk to the andoid.
[3:34:53] <%Ranryu692> basically the other side of the station
[3:34:55] <+xemnahort> @patstaresat stuff back from the cops
[3:34:56] <Javi9563> go to the tsf office
[3:35:03] <owleyet> i love both kotors but hate replaying them myself
[3:35:05] <subjectg> So David Carradine was fighting off Sith Assassins the entire time?
[3:35:10] <owleyet> So this is amazing
[3:35:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat just go get your items first.
[3:35:17] <SoftLusca> The door will only open with the correct porg
[3:35:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> This will take forever.
[3:35:21] <%JJCheeker> Can't wait until Visas shows up... She has the sexiest voice! Kreygasm
[3:35:27] <Clundy> @subjectg I was waiting for someone to bring him up LUL
[3:35:29] <dinnydanny777> LUL
[3:35:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> Never stop punching and kicking those trees
[3:35:30] <highfivesquash> use the force
[3:35:32] <%AzureGale> PUSH IT REAL GOOD
[3:35:36] <%dekkitout> Do what no sole Karren could
[3:35:37] <Broken_Sonex> "GOD, where is the manager in this place? I swear they make them hard to find on purpose!"
[3:35:41] <Teras_ode> "why is this woman kicking the door down?"
[3:35:44] <highfivesquash> jedi door punch
[3:35:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I like Karen's powerful stance.
[3:35:51] <dinnydanny777> This IS something a Karen would do LUL
[3:36:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You have to use the elevator
[3:36:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> @JJCheeker the KOTOR series has the best ladies, I swear.
[3:36:25] <%JJCheeker> Very true
[3:36:25] <MassConnect> Juhani?
[3:36:28] <subjectg> yo, kill that rodian for shits and giggles
[3:36:43] <+EnergyMax> ah that sound dithering KreyGasm
[3:36:44] <%JJCheeker> Maybe not so much her
[3:36:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Juhani would've been hot if she wasn't a flat texture.
[3:36:47] <DickieWoodsmall_279> watching someone hold their hand up and then run at the speed of a normal human has real naruto run cringe vid vibes
[3:36:49] <PirateMike_> use the force to zoom everywhere
[3:36:50] <%honeyman18> Karren off at knight speed to find the manager
[3:36:59] <Clundy> What about Force Pee? It’s like force push, but with piss.
[3:37:08] <Teras_ode> "You wouldn't download a map!"
[3:37:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Too_Much_Nukie This is true.
[3:37:15] <Dhafo> PogChamp
[3:37:20] <Broken_Sonex> Juhani would've been hot, if she didn't have her face
[3:37:26] <+canseesea> I love the idea of a subway system that only takes you to places that you've walked before
[3:37:36] <+skeletonmilk> Hi Pat if you had to eat a Star Wars creature, which would you eat
[3:37:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Broken_Sonex This is ALSO true.
[3:37:51] <PirateMike_> when hot albino gf
[3:37:53] <%JJCheeker> I will be your doooom
[3:37:55] <notenoughgirls> i feel like modern graphics could make juhani more palatable
[3:37:57] <highfivesquash> how about a subway system that only takes you to places where there are angry hobo
[3:37:57] <donstylo> If i remember correct if you go to the terminals you can later fast travel via terminal.
[3:37:59] <highfivesquash> s
[3:38:05] <Clundy> @canseesea It’s Streetpass but for public transport
[3:38:14] <%twistedj3ster> I would eat a Jabba Pig Guard
[3:38:15] <Broken_Sonex> @GarbageQueenEllie Find a mod that replaces it, or just a paper bag mod
[3:38:16] <%Xevtes> bulldog face
[3:38:22] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah you can fast travel through the terminals on this planet after you've been to an aera.

[3:43:14] <%dekkitout> He sounded so defeated saying that
[3:43:17] <donstylo> Man, the TSF deserves to be called police.
[3:43:18] <Dragovus> SPEAK TO THE ROBOTS MANAGER!
[3:43:25] <Grandma_Amari> I WOULD LIKE. TO SPEAK. TO YOUR MANAGER.
[3:43:32] <dinnydanny777> Atton is so insecure holy shit LUL
[3:43:33] <Broken_Sonex> "OH, YOU PEOPLE ARE SO SUED!"
[3:43:35] <ravioli_ronin> T3 came from space to laugh at you
[3:43:37] <KaitlynnHere> yes Atton, that small droid is laughing its ass off at you
[3:43:38] <Teras_ode> I DEMAND A NEW SHIP
[3:43:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I refuse to leave until someone fixes this.
[3:43:53] <%0dokuro> Always blame the robot
[3:44:00] <%doomunderthestairs> the Kaa'Ryn is stron within pat
[3:44:02] <%dekkitout> You WILL reimburse me!
[3:44:05] <%Teintstein> My husband knows a lawyer!
[3:44:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> I NEED TO TALK TO YOUR KERNEL
[3:44:26] <PirateMike_> imagine threatening a robot
[3:44:30] <kipperxl> i would like to talker to your manage
[3:44:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> Guys. It was the Snow Hoes
[3:44:46] <+popcorntacomon> Oh god pat is making Darth Karen
[3:44:48] <Ozavic> Imagine threatening a cash register
[3:44:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Get me a real person to talk to, I'm not leaving.
[3:44:54] <Grandma_Amari> TSF seems like total chumps I dunno man
[3:44:55] <%toolofparanoia> The Exchange huh?
[3:45:01] <Broken_Sonex> MY HUSBAND IS A LAWYER! YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM HIM
[3:45:08] <kipperxl> this robot needs more power, unlimited power, give him a boost!
[3:45:08] <%toolofparanoia> Lets go talk to the space mafia!
[3:45:13] <DickieWoodsmall_279> hey guys any advice to quit smoking? my throat hurts and I want to enjoy food again
[3:45:16] <jtsoppy137> the cops say hey the mob might now where your shit is
[3:45:16] <Huntercd> kill them all
[3:45:18] <kipperxl> make him think better
[3:45:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Imagine threatening a self-checkout register because you can't see that it's already given you your receipt.
[3:45:19] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Sounds like the Exchange better find themselves a lawyer
[3:45:24] <highfivesquash> Your light saber was fired into space
[3:45:26] <%Puhff> Snow Hoes, you say? Go on...
[3:45:30] <dinnydanny777> Hmm why does this droid know about the Exchange LUL
[3:45:32] <Teras_ode> @popcorntacomon little does he know the game already has a Darth Karen in hiding Kappa
[3:45:36] <Clundy> There should be a “remove voice module” to threaten droids option
[3:45:38] <%0dokuro> Ya
[3:45:39] <dinnydanny777> Crimelord droid?
[3:45:40] <donstylo> Androids in star wars are like british people, they hate you but still being polite.
[3:45:40] <%toolofparanoia> Of course the exchange is helping with the re-construction of Telos
[3:45:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Seems like engine limitations.
[3:45:48] <Ozavic> Because you can skip the previous section
[3:45:56] <Ozavic> I assume at least
[3:45:57] <Broken_Sonex> @dinnydanny777 Hey, yeah.....
[3:46:07] <%arancet> Kae'ryn needs her double whipped venti mocha latte NOW or something WILL die
[3:46:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Puhff There's like six of them, and the youngest one is the Hot One. They wear matching Uggs and North Face.
[3:46:12] <%dekkitout> That stance tho monkaS
[3:46:15] <Grandma_Amari> I honestly would prefer it if they just completely stripped you of all that garbage outside maybe medpacks, and you just had to get new gear.
[3:46:27] <PirateMike_> you gonna be sleeping with the space fishes
[3:46:36] <%dekkitout> Oh, those snow hoes
[3:46:49] <notsoy> vibroblade is modifiable, vibrocutter is not
[3:46:51] <%0dokuro> I wanna feel the slice~
[3:46:53] <RandyFistburgers> Space vibrators
[3:46:54] <subjectg> @grandma_amari hey now, some of that garbage can be sold for cash
[3:46:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Vibrosword is from Kreia's cutscene. It's why you take her weapons before the Sion fight.
[3:46:54] <%Alazull> Why no vibro great sword?
[3:46:54] <+pally_din> looks like blades are upgradeable, swords are not
[3:47:02] <Broken_Sonex> Can't even get a decent spice late in this SHITHOLE?!
[3:47:03] <Clundy> @grandma_amari if this got remade they would force you to become a mandatory an so you say “yay I got the armor from the show!”
[3:47:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> No swords are upgradable too.
[3:47:12] <%ssjklyco> You will pew pews
[3:47:15] <Clundy> Mandelorian*
[3:47:18] <%Theycallmenerf> Vibro ultra great sword?

[3:48:29] <Grandma_Amari> She sensed the twirl
[3:48:30] <kipperxl> do a murder
[3:48:32] <Huntercd> She wants you to start killing
[3:48:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Every time you equip a new weapon you go into combat for a split second.
[3:48:33] <%DemonOfSalt> Kreia can't *not* buff.
[3:48:34] <subjectg> @patstaresat any time kreia is in combat stance she does that
[3:48:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Don't ask me why.
[3:48:36] <%Blank9> because you love it
[3:48:36] <Valentinius_Anodyne> She just wants to see you grow strong, Pat :)
[3:48:37] <PirateMike_> looking cool karen

[3:49:04] <Broken_Sonex> ATTON WITH THE NOTHING PERSONAL KID
[3:49:06] <%ssjklyco> That looked great
[3:49:15] <%vexion_smh> bitch is ready to fight 24/7
[3:49:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It really feels like they intended the fuel sidequest to have multiple solutions instead of just one.
[3:49:31] <%dekkitout> D-does Atton have the coveted timestop?
[3:49:38] <Teras_ode> just print more credits 4Head
[3:49:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> It is. Just print more credits. The government does it all the time

[3:50:19] <PirateMike_> i wish more games would let you flourish your weapons
[3:50:19] <%Alazull> You bet your sweet ass if there are credits to be made Imma be doing it
[3:50:25] <OldManDeckardCain> just the usual
[3:50:30] <%vexion_smh> evilest pat
[3:50:31] <%Teintstein> ya purty evil
[3:50:33] <Broken_Sonex> Well, he's already demanding to speak to the manager
[3:50:33] <donstylo> They have technology to travel faster than the speed of light but they still rely on fuel.
[3:50:34] <+crunchygrl> how did you even manage to get so evil so fast
[3:50:35] <%king_wragles> I guess platinum blondes are just evil motherfuckers
[3:50:36] <KaiserMario> Have you spoken to many managers yet?
[3:50:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Puhff They are, they love to fight. But they always want to make love to "Ice Ice Baby". It gets old after a while

[3:50:42] <%ssjklyco> He's currently at Activision, but gunning for EA evil
[3:50:44] <ThatGuyThere03> But are you comically evil or like just extremely efficient?
[3:50:47] <%Dunmarkh> hey that's also after you killed that alien
[3:50:47] <%Medrex> I could imagine a general under pockets being a psychotic Karen
[3:50:48] <+crunchygrl> ive never seen an evil this fast!
[3:50:54] <Broken_Sonex> YEAH, FUCK WOOLIE.
[3:51:10] <Grandma_Amari> Pat's gonna be maxxed out Dark Side (now) by likethe middle of the next planet lol
[3:51:12] <ravioli_ronin> You look like you’re gonna go listen to The Cure and cry
[3:51:18] <Ice_Ventura549> @Alazull the Win-Du Clan
[3:51:21] <%Teintstein> @crunchygrl I dunno, he did do some space racism earlier so maybe that contributed
[3:51:35] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @ssjklyco Idk man, activision has been pretty fucking evil lately, I think they passed EA but no one's even close to ubisoft
[3:51:40] <%Dunmarkh> The cops didn't care when you killed that unarmed alien
[3:51:53] <%Medrex> shopping-based thuggery
[3:51:55] <+LionKagura> YES
[3:52:02] <donstylo> Just like in real life.

[3:52:50] <ThatGuyThere03> Wait is Kenny the pogchamp emote now?
[3:52:52] <+pally_din> Fuck principles
[3:53:03] <Clundy> I just got very sad because we never got a Star Trek game in this style mikeliveKirk
[3:53:05] <DickieWoodsmall_279> you gotta make the crystal red by hurting its feelings
[3:53:07] <Grandma_Amari> I don't think you can get a lightsaber until the next planet at the earliest, unless I missed something.
[3:53:07] <Ice_Ventura549> fuck principals
[3:53:07] <subjectg> fuck the code
[3:53:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Don't forget this guy has the smuggling quests.
[3:53:30] <highfivesquash> star trek generations for the pentium is this
[3:53:32] <%Dunmarkh> Is Karen morally gray?
[3:53:35] <highfivesquash> get good chat
[3:53:36] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You get a discount for doing his quests.
[3:53:41] <%dekkitout> Time for dark (robes) later
[3:53:44] <Grandma_Amari> Gray Jedi robes get a buff because they lose out on the fucking light side/dark side reduction to force powers.
[3:53:50] <%Alazull> Full of the power of neutral
[3:53:53] <Grandma_Amari> Gray jedi do I mean
[3:53:57] <%DemonOfSalt> You need the gun first.
[3:53:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You have to talk to Grenn after getting the droid for Czerka/Ithoria
[3:53:59] <CrimsonFox777> Bronze lightsabers? Wonder if there are any silver ones because that seems awesome.
[3:54:03] <+crunchygrl> the power of centrism
[3:54:03] <rsg220> need the modified hold out blaster and bring it to him
[3:54:13] <%dekkitout> Witness the true power of the fence sitter
[3:54:14] <%0dokuro> Ironic that youre doing the quest for gray jedi robes

[3:54:29] <David_Bowie_Sensei> @CrimsonFox777 Silver exists yes. This game went crazy with the colors.
[3:54:30] <Clundy> @highfivesquash shit seriously? I’ve honestly never heard of it.
[3:54:33] <CrimsonFox777> Aww yiss
[3:54:35] <DickieWoodsmall_279> let the Swede flow through you
[3:54:36] <subjectg> we gonna play some PAZAAK

[3:54:42] <jtsoppy137> wait what
[3:54:43] <+canseesea> These clubs have the least star wars music ever
[3:54:43] <PirateMike_> fighting in that huge robe must be soooooooo comfortable Kappa
[3:54:51] <jtsoppy137> oh
[3:54:57] <ThatGuyThere03> @SaiyanShoto ...
[3:54:58] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I prefer 1 myself.
[3:55:00] <%SirGO0SE> its going well, but would be better with Force Kin
[3:55:03] <%Alazull> It's nice to watch this and not have someone screaming at chat to shut the fuck up every hour or so
[3:55:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The trappings of power, I love that.
[3:55:21] <%dekkitout> "Because you're the player character, duh"
[3:55:28] <highfivesquash> there are three star trek generations from that era and basically only one of them was good but it's the one htat's hard to find, so many people published star trek games
[3:55:29] <DickieWoodsmall_279> what she means is that the NPCs don't have schedules or pathfinding code
[3:55:31] <+xemnahort> I like a good Bronze and purple lightsaber combo
[3:55:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> "You dumb bitch."
[3:55:35] <dinnydanny777> @sirgo0se I agree, Force Kin is the best ability
[3:55:37] <%baka_sugoi> D E A T H
[3:55:38] <marcomatame> why is this lipsync just as good as andromeda's
[3:55:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Alazull I could tell you to shut up if you want, but it wouldn't be the same.
[3:55:43] <highfivesquash> and the liscence holders refused to let them name them differently because that would imply new episodes
[3:55:52] <robotman37> "These...fetch quest you weaklings call it"
[3:55:53] <+skeletonmilk> The slurping in the background adds a good element to this conversation.
[3:55:55] <DickieWoodsmall_279> YES, WE GOT BEAN KREIA
[3:55:56] <%twoto858> B E A N S

[4:01:09] <SoftLusca> Let the rage flow through you
[4:01:10] <Ozavic> Pat is going for a 'Scorched Earth' playthrough where he tries to get as many companions as possible to hate him
[4:01:11] <%Medrex> Basically Jedi Jesus now
[4:01:15] <$DocMadfox> Dark Side later points
[4:01:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> Kreia likes: Subtlety, Independence, listening to her teachings. Just do the opposite of that stuff
[4:01:16] <darkrevan362> use a guide at this point
[4:01:17] <%slaughtedlamb> so, pat has to choose between krea and dark side
[4:01:22] <socratetris> mamoru all the nakamas
[4:01:22] <+pally_din> That would be the Karen move

[4:01:38] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Pat it's ok if you cheat influence
[4:01:40] <EasternEagle21> Is Pat aware that there is no difference in dialogue for Kreia between high influence and low influence?
[4:01:41] <%baka_sugoi> too klill
[4:01:43] <%FacetiousAF> that's a dumb question i need it for big murders

[4:02:21] <+xemnahort> @easterneagle21 yeah but if he keeps getting influence gains and drops then he won’t be high or low enough for all the conversations
[4:02:26] <ThatGuyThere03> Oh my god you're turning into exactly the kinda sith Kreia HATES
[4:02:30] <PirateMike_> bitch just give me the laser sword
[4:02:35] <%dekkitout> "You'll get the parts as you play, doofus"
[4:02:37] <subjectg> Fun fact, Kreia has extra dialogue here if your male, talking about how it has much more importance to dem boys
[4:02:39] <+gespenst25> (co-incidentally this is why the fights in the Prequel trilogy aren't as cool as the vader vs luke fights.)
[4:02:41] <marvel877> I don't know, man, I've never seen a Jedi go ham on anyone with just their bare hands.
[4:02:41] <highfivesquash> pat as angry padawan batman is the best concept so far
[4:02:46] <highfivesquash> angry patman for summerslam
[4:02:46] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Yeah but kreia is a bitch anyway
[4:02:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> Blaster Jedi are cool, but give me fucking Slugthrower Jedi

[4:07:59] <+clockworkblues> tell him bad dog
[4:08:01] <%FacetiousAF> you put his nose in it and say BAD
[4:08:01] <Ice_Ventura549> poop in his house
[4:08:04] <%Taisuru> @walnutcast Call borkbusters
[4:08:06] <%Ranryu692> Poop on the street. That'll confuse him
[4:08:07] <%AzureGale> Hire Ivan Drago
[4:08:07] <subjectg> @walnutcast view him as disposable
[4:08:09] <%justcallmebobplease> Woolie's casual tone of voice on saying he was just gonna keep multi-button pressing was what made that the most insane and infuriating, IMO - like at least acknowledge your (admittedly viable) approach is trash, don't get smug!
[4:08:11] <%AzureGale> He will break you
[4:08:18] <%CalderGaming> actually do not rub his nose in it
[4:08:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> I always loved the minigames in this, the sound design was fantastic.

[4:08:50] <%justcallmebobplease> Pat text Woolie and ask him which button is the go button in Swoop
[4:08:52] <%Taisuru> @walnutcast Rub your nose in it
[4:08:55] <Broken_Sonex> @justcallmebobplease I know, Woolie likes to be a smug fuck about lots of stuff

[4:09:43] <Ice_Ventura549> Jizz is in every cantina. Jizz central
[4:09:45] <%Nobrev> rather than trying to get the dog to not shit in the house turn it around and actively train them where it is ok to shit
[4:09:52] <%Medrex> Anyone with the name "Slusk" does not matter. anyone who works for them matters less

[4:21:38] <Grandma_Amari> Influence is literally your influence over them, not necessarily that they like you.
[4:21:38] <%0dokuro> Honestly playing the game as you would normally play would probably make them actually hate you.
[4:21:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Atton loving murder is part of his backstory.
[4:21:39] <alroy900> he just can't help himself but like anything you do it seems

[4:23:00] <subjectg> @grandma_amari pretty sure you can come back and accept
[4:23:05] <%DemonOfSalt> Nihilus representing the sum of being nothing but evil intent. Not even the worst version of the Exile is worse than Nihilus.
[4:23:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> mur canary
[4:23:27] <%Monkeyweed21> you know Woolie owned that slave too right?
[4:23:39] <%DemonOfSalt> No matter how much you let Kreia down, you will always be more than Nihilus.
[4:23:40] <Grandma_Amari> Alright that's cool, was worried it was like a 'quest unavailable now' entry. or whatever.
[4:23:55] <subjectg> the difference here is that pat is honest about being all about slavery
[4:23:58] <%radda343> "thank you pay me"
[4:24:03] <Darkfire346> you know Woolie taught the slave to main Blanka, right?
[4:24:11] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @Monkeyweed21 but when woolie does it he's fulfilling revenge fantasies Kappa

[4:24:29] <Grandma_Amari> She really does

[4:24:35] <+rainlily1245> @DemonOfSalt tbf tho, a Dark Side Exile essentially becomes a Nihilus by letting their Force Succ get out of control, just like Nihilus did
[4:24:37] <%JJCheeker> 17 years ago I was probably playing this game
[4:24:40] <%0dokuro> ye
[4:24:42] <%Teintstein> this sounds like a mod voice
[4:24:47] <%dekkitout> Echo- drink
[4:24:55] <Broken_Sonex> Woolie likes to think he was in the right to make that girl dace for money.
[4:24:55] <Teras_ode> drink
[4:24:55] <%0dokuro> it like someone edited it it mid-way.
[4:24:56] <%Teintstein> is this modded KOTOR 2
[4:24:59] <Coystick> Please fix her voice specifically.
[4:25:08] <%Dunmarkh> @Teintstein yes
[4:25:15] <Darkfire346> She looks like a Data ripoff
[4:25:15] <%AzureGale> Amaters
[4:25:15] <+pally_din> can't unhear the echo
[4:25:32] <%DemonOfSalt> @DemonOfSalt You can get close to him, but you still bond with Dark Side party members. Nihilus doesn't even get to have a meaningful relationship with Visas.
[4:25:33] <GarbageQueenEllie> Actually, good intentions DO end up saving the planet
[4:25:38] <Coystick> It's very loud
[4:25:41] <+ThomasOfTroy> It's on the plosives
[4:25:43] <Teras_ode> sooo, another?
[4:25:44] <%Maids4lyfe> I'm hearing it kinda
[4:25:45] <%radda343> it's very quiet
[4:25:57] <%SirGO0SE> czerking off
[4:25:58] <Darkfire346> I can hear it
[4:26:02] <%Nobrev> it's on like every S sound she makes
[4:26:05] <Darkfire346> its very Boomy
[4:26:05] <Coystick> It could be louder
[4:26:09] <%0dokuro> Its the very start of the sentence when it happens. Its like somone fixed the echo for the rest of the sentence except the start.
[4:26:10] <Grandma_Amari> It's very minor, maybe it's locational thing, like it's echoing because of her office?
[4:26:10] <DickieWoodsmall_279> bathroom recording
[4:26:13] <jkfd> there is an echo in the high mid to high freqs. you may not be able to hear it
[4:26:15] <+xemnahort> I think her voice is echoing off the room
[4:26:24] <%radda343> it's fine, she recorded her lines in a tin can
[4:26:42] <+Dova573> Do you pay in Beskar?
[4:26:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> psssh you could make 500 by selling mines
[4:26:46] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's so nice to FINALLY talk to a manager.
[4:26:47] <%Medrex> The ATM makes more than that in an afternoon
[4:26:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And a reasonable woman as well.
[4:26:56] <%0dokuro> Honestly with how fast this was made I wouldnt doubt this was voice lined in a tin can.
[4:27:06] <Jonny_Uppercut> 4 and a half hours late to the stream I missed so much ayaSAD
[4:27:14] <Darkfire346> also dont forget about that line at the top
[4:27:22] <+xemnahort> It still baffles me that czerka pays less than the hippies
[4:27:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> That is pocket change for helping secure a planet-sized contract
[4:27:29] <%Nobrev> I dont think its a sound problem, just her lines specifically @PatStaresAt
[4:27:34] <Coystick> I love that line
[4:27:36] <%0dokuro> the screen is off by 1 centimeter.

[4:29:29] <+paladinstarbuster> he wanted to feel the kill
[4:29:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Ranged behavior switches to melee at close range.
[4:29:34] <%Taisuru> He wants to feel them die
[4:29:35] <Daxalog> he was in melee range
[4:29:55] <%RetroCop87> does it deal the same damage as ranged?
[4:30:03] <subjectg> Leave him on aggressive
[4:30:04] <%radda343> it's because ranged gets a penalty in melee don't you d&d

[5:06:03] <ChungusQuest> you'll be dead!
[5:06:07] <%Madbearv> Madbearv subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! Are you winning Pat?
[5:06:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Use the terminals you've been downloading the maps from.
[5:06:17] <+SinisterBroccoli> you have to talk to them and you unlock them
[5:06:19] <+xemnahort> @too_much_nukie so kind of wrinkly or dark eyeshadow and yellow eyes
[5:06:20] <+SinisterBroccoli> where you get the area maps

[5:10:22] <%MisterTylerrr> He singin?
[5:10:23] <%Ranryu692> it's a veil
[5:10:24] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @TapAtoLive She won't actually show up on the ship until after you leave Telos.
[5:10:24] <TapAtoLive> Like, if this triggers before you leave Telos, then when does the Visas encounter trigger?
[5:10:26] <+xemnahort> @ranryu692 ikr
[5:10:26] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> what could it be?
[5:10:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> They account for this.
[5:10:27] <HotMafia81> Darth Flusho

[5:10:56] <RandyFistburgers> Choke me daddy
[5:10:57] <HotMafia81> He speak the language of the toilet
[5:10:58] <%Alazull> Visas is absolutely a PAWG
[5:10:58] <%DemonOfSalt> Nihilus: Fight forever! *clap clap clap clap clap*
[5:10:59] <%AzureGale> What a dick
[5:11:00] <%TheBensonator_> Nihilus: bro. Nihl: no.
[5:11:04] <Broken_Sonex> @Broken_Sonex I mean, look at that dump truck.
[5:11:07] <+xemnahort> @tapatolive well considering it needs a ship the earliest is on the first real planet
[5:11:07] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Not even Obsidian understands Cthulu-speak
[5:11:08] <%ArchimerCXV> a black hole incarnate
[5:11:13] <CursedNobleman> tags, breathplay, blindfolds, ntr
[5:11:15] <%Blank9> nihilus is the only sith that is as much a threat as the emperor should be
[5:11:16] <mattymcfilth> is he gonna fuck her?
[5:11:16] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> what's his main power again? Big Force Hungry or something?
[5:11:18] <ThatGuyThere03> Darth Traya is a contender to me personally
[5:11:19] <%dekkitout> Abaloth
[5:11:20] <%CaptainPileDriver> he speaks eldritch horror
[5:11:22] <Broken_Sonex> HE FEELS LEGIT
[5:11:24] <huskarl_zap> pawgers
[5:11:25] <mishraharad> Nihilus is really 40k-y
[5:11:26] <%CaptainPileDriver> he's awesome
[5:11:27] <%Madbearv> he's an eldritch abomination
[5:11:28] <ChungusQuest> He feels like something out of a really good EU novel
[5:11:30] <%TheBensonator_> Nihilus is way up there for me, but Malgus is just cool as FUCK
[5:11:32] <%Visorak6> he is the shape of a person
[5:11:33] <@SoFarFetched> get your choke sex out of here geefStahp
[5:11:34] <Valentinius_Anodyne> He's an eldritch horror, and it's great
[5:11:35] <%CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt Per the lore, he isn't.
[5:11:36] <$Afterman_> hes no maul but hes cool
[5:11:36] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @ThatGuyThere03 Agreed, she better
[5:11:38] <%DemonOfSalt> @Blank9 Nihilus would eat Palpatine and Valkorian instantly.
[5:11:38] <KaiserMario> Darth "Bitch, where's my sandwich? Nvm, I'll munch on you instead" Nihilus
[5:11:39] <%Alazull> His main power is being a tear in the fabric of reality
[5:11:45] <+ThomasOfTroy> He's an eldritch horror
[5:11:49] <HotMafia81> And that mask is rad as hell.
[5:11:49] <%dekkitout> Good.
[5:11:50] <%Visorak6> there is not
[5:11:51] <+Pyroclase> and that's awesome
[5:11:53] <%Monkeyweed21> not anymore
[5:11:54] <%CaptainPileDriver> just evil dark side energy?
[5:11:56] <%CatastropheCorvid> There isn't. It's alluded to.
[5:11:56] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> @Alazull I thought Sion was the force woudn
[5:11:57] <dinnydanny777> Spirit
[5:11:58] <RiverBirch> Nihilus is JUST the armor
[5:11:58] <%VoidBaronJules> it's midichlorians in a trench coat
[5:11:59] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There is according to the EU but in the game there is not.
[5:12:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> He's just a big pile of sentient black goo
[5:12:01] <CrypticMochi> He a person turned into a living calamity
[5:12:01] <%Blank9> he's scary enough that the idea that there should be only 2 sith makes sense if that's one of them
[5:12:02] <%ssjklyco> It was Palpatine the whole time
[5:12:03] <Grandma_Amari> Yeah that's a good way to look at it
[5:12:04] <Broken_Sonex> HE'S JUST A HUNGRY PHANTOM AND IT'S GREAT
[5:12:06] <dinnydanny777> Would that make him a force ghost?
[5:12:07] <%Maids4lyfe> it's mostly dust at this point I think
[5:12:08] <%MidnightBurst12> it is inconclusive
[5:12:08] <$Afterman_> the best part of him is his mask for sure
[5:12:11] <TapAtoLive> @Admiral_PopnFresh Yeah, that makes sense. I was wondering if it'd mean you fought Visas as soon as you boarded the Hawk to leave Telos LUL
[5:12:16] <%CatastropheCorvid> Essentially.
[5:12:18] <subjectg> The Hungry Hungry Sith Lord
[5:12:19] <%TheLemuroid> He reminds me of a D&D larva mage
[5:12:22] <%JJCheeker> im a simp for VISAS
[5:12:22] <%TheBensonator_> He's a literal wound in the Force, it's so fuckin metal
[5:12:24] <%dekkitout> "Nobody cared who I was till I put the mask on"
[5:12:25] <ChungusQuest> A man-shaped hole in the Force.
[5:12:27] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt A HUNGRY PHANTOM BOI
[5:12:37] <knotsundownsyndrome> if i recall, the mask is all that's keeping him?
[5:12:37] <HotMafia81> Honestly all the sith in the KOTOR games are cool as hell, even by their designs alone.
[5:12:46] <%JJCheeker> oh no don't ban me
[5:12:46] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> nothing is as cool as the guy who's so fucking pissed he just keeps holds his decaying corpse together with his brain thoughts
[5:12:52] <%Alazull> @DickieWoodsmall_279 I think the implication is that all the Sith Lords in this are wounds in the force. Nihilus is just an actual tear that consumes the Force, sucking it to who knows where
[5:12:54] <%DemonOfSalt> Darth Nihilus is a Dark Souls boss in a world that is not hardcore enough to handle anything related to Dark Souls.
[5:12:57] <Whtevrhpnd2mary> He reminds me of Armus, the Skin of Evil
[5:13:03] <%JJCheeker> I forgot
[5:13:05] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Ehh Malak is kinda dumb, but everyone else I love in Kotor
[5:13:08] <%Ranryu692> that waas one
[5:13:08] <TapAtoLive> Five?
[5:13:09] <+xemnahort> Is there a mod to hide head gear?
[5:13:13] <%Ranryu692> the information terminal
[5:13:14] <dinnydanny777> Isn't Sion literally too angry to die
[5:13:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> LUL
[5:13:16] <%Ranryu692> was a fast travel point
[5:13:17] <CursedNobleman> Darth Traya with a soft A LUL
[5:13:17] <%SolidusRex> Five?
[5:13:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> Well, when you kill him, Mando asks Visas what she sees under his mask, and she says "A man... nothing more."
[5:13:24] <knotsundownsyndrome> sion is too angry to die
[5:13:25] <+SinisterBroccoli> You should check out Darth Bane
[5:13:27] <+Pyroclase> Wait, do you mean to tell me you don't like the new quirky droid from TROS????
[5:13:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Five is correct.
[5:13:29] <+SinisterBroccoli> he's cool
[5:13:30] <%linSP> i HATE star wars now
[5:13:32] <olaksi> They are high budget franchise movies, of course they are boring
[5:13:33] <%MidnightBurst12> I can think of four
[5:13:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> 3 + 2./
[5:13:35] <%dekkitout> The canon Darth Bane SUCKS
[5:13:35] <Admiral_PopnFresh> yyyyyyup
[5:13:35] <%JJCheeker> you are correct
[5:13:37] <$Quiet__Viking> Kotor is the best star wars will ever be
[5:13:37] <+xemnahort> @xerosigmaprime Malak is pretty basic for a Sith Lord
[5:13:39] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> LOCAL SITH LORD TOO PISSED OFF TO DIE
[5:13:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> adam driver literally carries those movies more than any other character
[5:13:41] <%Blank9> the movie siths are ALL lame
[5:13:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's by the cantina exit.
[5:13:46] <%Ranryu692> cantina entrance
[5:13:46] <Darkred28> Are we still on world record pace?
[5:13:47] <knotsundownsyndrome> @GarbageQueenEllie visas is miraluka, she speaks metaphorically since she doesn't have actual vision
[5:13:49] <%Mr_Pylon> I had some brief hope in Snoke being a literal giant fucked up looking guy but then
[5:13:51] <KaiserMario> But Pat, they brought back the Emperor! THE EMPEROR PAT
[5:13:57] <notenoughgirls> malak is basic but he serves his purpose
[5:14:00] <%Ranryu692> to the right of the cantina entrance right here
[5:14:01] <subjectg> @garbagequeenellie you could say she was speaking metaphorically, as a capstone to her arc
[5:14:05] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Bane_Kaikyo subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[5:14:06] <olaksi> that's like saying an AAA game is boring, of course it is
[5:14:08] <fuji_92> when are u not blind , is the better question
[5:14:09] <Broken_Sonex> They're all legit. All of them
[5:14:13] <CrypticMochi> Malak exists to be the basic bitch
[5:14:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> @knotsundownsyndrome This is true, it always confused me
[5:14:15] <%XeroSigmaPrime> God it so stupid how Darth Bane STIL HASNT BEEN BROUGHT BACK (outside of some stupid out of place cameo)
[5:14:16] <%MidnightBurst12> passed it again
[5:14:16] <%dekkitout> Held up with the glue of hate
[5:14:16] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> and he wants to bust his curdled nut inside your character don't forget, it's canon
[5:14:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt It's by the cantina exit.
[5:14:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The one by TSF
[5:14:19] <%Blank9> I guess the Emperor's broken superpower is his canonical force field that makes people stupid and unable to think clearly
[5:14:21] <%TheMattman1313> In retrospec I honestly think if The Last Jedi was the start of the new trilogy there would be a lot more cool lore stuff, especially with the Force kids
[5:14:21] <%Alazull> Sion has to be convinced to give up to beat him. You literally cannot kill him. It is a great idea
[5:14:24] <%Bane_Kaikyo> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[5:14:27] <%Monkeyweed21> Nihilus is just a black hole in the force
[5:14:27] <%JJCheeker> the writing was bad
[5:14:34] <dinnydanny777> Isn't it implied Sion was a Jedi before all this too?
[5:14:34] <%TheMattman1313> Minus the other parts of the casino
[5:14:35] <knotsundownsyndrome> @GarbageQueenEllie actually she has different dialogue depending on your force alignment
[5:14:41] <%barkon345> with that force Nah
[5:14:41] <%CatastropheCorvid> @GarbageQueenEllie After that, it's alluded to that Visas either lied or misunderstood, and that the ship was being held together by sheer will, as was Nihilus
[5:14:46] <%Ranryu692> they do save time once you have them lol
[5:14:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> @knotsundownsyndrome oooo, nice
[5:14:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nihilus is a black hole in the force.
[5:14:50] <Coystick> A black hole
[5:14:56] <%Ranryu692> sorry, just trying to be helpful
[5:14:57] <$Quiet__Viking> A Void in the Force
[5:14:58] <Broken_Sonex> HUNGRY GOST BOI
[5:15:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It makes him very powerful but he only exists to feed his hunger.
[5:15:04] <Broken_Sonex> GHOST*
[5:15:04] <%Maids4lyfe> he's somehow barely held together a personality
[5:15:05] <timdtoolmantaylor> qtsCrack qtsCrack qtsCrack qtsCrack qtsSnacc qtsSnacc qtsSnacc
[5:15:05] <knotsundownsyndrome> if you're dark side, visas just says "i see nothing"
[5:15:08] <knotsundownsyndrome> or something
[5:15:08] <HotMafia81> As far as binary evil/good shit goes, these games made it super compelling.
[5:15:09] <%Blank9> he wanted so much that he just sucked all the force, forever
[5:15:11] <%dekkitout> Tldr a bunch of people died so hard the echo shocked a couple of holes in the force
[5:15:14] <%DemonOfSalt> Force Vampiricy for the win.
[5:15:17] <i_am_therydon> death incarnate?
[5:15:18] <Ice_Ventura549> Sith are meant to be metal while they make them more emo now
[5:15:23] <Coystick> Nihilus is the Dark Souls of Sith Lords
[5:15:28] <CrypticMochi> He’s like the dead end to the dark side path
[5:15:33] <bettysharkface> I don't like that worm man
[5:15:38] <KaiserMario> Very LOTR, very Witch King
[5:15:40] <%CatastropheCorvid> Side room
[5:15:43] <%CatastropheCorvid> In hanger
[5:15:49] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> nihilus is literally the nihilus of sith lords, there is no comparison
[5:15:53] <%CatastropheCorvid> Passed it
[5:15:55] <knotsundownsyndrome> once you get his mask, if i recall that's him in his entirety
[5:15:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> LUL
[5:16:07] <%CaptainPileDriver> yeeeeeeAAAAAH SELL OUT TO THE MAN
[5:16:15] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah Nihilus IS his mask.
[5:16:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Wrong :)
[5:16:21] <%CaptainPileDriver> big corporate sellout all day
[5:16:27] <Broken_Sonex> Darth Nihilus is the most hungry it's ever been
[5:16:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> But if you kill him as a lightside person Visas says she sees him as "Just a man"
[5:16:33] <orphancrippler_> nihilus vs kirby who wins?
[5:16:37] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> why didn't they get pat to write the dialogue choices for this game?
[5:16:37] <fuji_92> sellout time
[5:16:37] <+Pyroclase> holy shit those statues
[5:16:41] <+landmammal> big corpo
[5:16:41] <+Cowboy_Static> Cowboy_Static subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[5:16:46] <Coystick> Nice monocle idiot
[5:16:47] <dinnydanny777> She kind of sounds like an Alexa
[5:16:53] <%JJCheeker> kirby obviously
[5:16:59] <%CatastropheCorvid> @orphancrippler_ Definitely not the Cosmos...
[5:17:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> you took his jerrrb
[5:17:26] <%TheMattman1313> And then you shoot the droid in the back
[5:17:32] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> *twiddles fingers until the droid just works*
[5:17:34] <%CatastropheCorvid> "Doing what, Executive Lorso?"
[5:17:38] <Coystick> HAHAHAHA
[5:17:39] <KaiserMario> LUL
[5:17:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> in my game he bugs out and doesn't make it in the room
[5:17:44] <blue8moon> LUL
[5:17:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> like he clearly didn't
[5:17:45] <+firelink_dweller> Pat, thoughts on Mando season 2?
[5:17:46] <moonmintparadise> did the door just close before he walked in ???
[5:17:47] <%SGrim> That door just shut on him LUL
[5:18:03] <%CaptainPileDriver> the door shut on the droid
[5:18:08] <Broken_Sonex> @orphancrippler_ That's like saying which black hole will eat the other.
[5:18:19] <%king_wragles> @CatastropheCorvid I like to imagine he's just gonna plug into the mainframe and do nothing until someone realizes he's been giving a shit command
[5:18:30] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt I wish more of the lines were, "Oh, you don't get it. The only reason I am not painfully killing you is the promise of a reward."
[5:18:32] <+pally_din> Man you can't trust someone named SLUSK
[5:18:35] <orphancrippler_> is there a mod that just puts mermaid man screaming EVILLL everytime you gain a dark side point because I want one
[5:18:57] <RandyFistburgers> More big murder
[5:18:58] <%CatastropheCorvid> @king_wragles Sounds like some of my Co-workers...
[5:19:00] <%FacetiousAF> Every. Villain. Is. Lemons.
[5:19:02] <+SinisterBroccoli> that name is vile sounding
[5:19:03] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @orphancrippler_ It'd be easy to make one
[5:19:06] <MildMannered_Creighton> Every villain is lemons
[5:19:07] <olaksi> organized crime, famous for temporary agreements
[5:19:09] <+SinisterBroccoli> please stop saying slusk
[5:19:13] <%thatfeel> Fuck Czerka, but the DS points are nice tho
[5:19:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Just replace a .wav file
[5:19:20] <medril07> can you be a good sith? can you be an evil jedi?
[5:19:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Oh my god.
[5:19:28] <huskarl_zap> S L U S K
[5:19:36] <dinnydanny777> She doesn't sound like anything would make her happy LUL
[5:19:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> that's called gray
[5:19:40] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You're like 75% dark.
[5:19:40] <+xemnahort> @medril07 in this no, in swtor yes
[5:19:44] <knotsundownsyndrome> oxymoronic
[5:19:46] <%Alazull> This isn't TOR
[5:19:46] <+Kilik_> is your character name....Karen?
[5:19:47] <%CalderGaming> it's still star wars, sadly
[5:19:49] <%FacetiousAF> can you be a sith lady with a big butt?
[5:19:53] <+SinisterBroccoli> You are an evil jedi technically
[5:19:54] <Broken_Sonex> It's only thing TOR does that's neat
[5:19:57] <subjectg> we’re 100% BLACK
[5:19:59] <medril07> right. never played these games
[5:20:00] <%CatastropheCorvid> Technically you can be a good Sith, if you count Sith as a real race, a la SWTOR
[5:20:00] <$Afterman_> not necessarily. there was that one sith who only wanted knowledge and did nothing evil
[5:20:05] <orphancrippler_> jedi is a religion you can probly be a bad light side user tho
[5:20:06] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> can't you do a mace windu and be a jedi trained in the dark side?
[5:20:06] <+SinisterBroccoli> can we agree Bao dur is the coolest?
[5:20:13] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Be like "Gooooood. Goooooooood."
[5:20:13] <medril07> was wondering why he had katanas
[5:20:17] <Admiral_PopnFresh> To be fair, Bao Dur always wants to suck your dick
[5:20:19] <fuji_92> will can?
[5:20:20] <%Alazull> Bao-Dur, use the arm please
[5:20:25] <%Alazull> You know the one
[5:20:27] <dinnydanny777> Bao Dur got poochied
[5:20:27] <Admiral_PopnFresh> A love him
[5:20:30] <%Blank9> bao dur is cool
[5:20:33] <%Blank9> but understated
[5:20:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Bao-Dur is simultaneously the best and worst party member. Depending on whether you're using restored content or not.
[5:20:37] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Bao is my favorite party member
[5:20:37] <%soulphantom44> soulphantom44 converted from a Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[5:20:37] <%luftraumm1> this game aludes to break in that dichotomy, but doesn't take it far
[5:20:37] <$Afterman_> @DickieWoodsmall_279 he wasnt trained in the dark side, his fighting style, vaapad (sp?) just was prone to pushing people over.
[5:20:38] <fuji_92> bao dur is ok
[5:20:41] <orphancrippler_> I'd suck remotes dick
[5:20:43] <%Monkeyweed21> he's amazing with the restored content
[5:20:44] <%thatfeel> Bao-Dur: PTSD the companion
[5:20:44] <%dekkitout> "General I must say, in that Sith get up you got hella drip"
[5:20:44] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt If you think he feels incomplete, that's because he IS.
[5:20:46] <+xemnahort> @alazull doodSteve doodInjury
[5:20:47] <%XeroSigmaPrime> His voice is so calming
[5:20:48] <medril07> dogs are the best
[5:20:52] <subjectg> bao dur’s a cool dude, but i wish he would stop recording his lines in the bathroom
[5:21:02] <KaiserMario> Technically by killing all the Jedi hypocrites, and killing the Sith Lords, you're doing the galaxy a service, so in the end even if you are a Sith, you still do some good...
[5:21:02] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> but he blocked the lightning, no one can do that
[5:21:07] <knotsundownsyndrome> @Afterman_ no, he had dark side abilities. force crush is a dark side ability and he uses it to crush grievous' chest
[5:21:08] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Bao-Dur is cool, but the game kinda forgets about him near the end. That's alleviated a little with the mod, but there's only so much it can restore
[5:21:09] <+SinisterBroccoli> he just likes to whisper
[5:21:19] <%CatastropheCorvid> @Broken_Sonex Literally missing content. It sucks
[5:21:25] <+firelink_dweller> I go on stupid adventures with my cat, does that count?
[5:21:25] <ShichiNoBushi> A "best friend" if you will?
[5:21:28] <$Afterman_> @knotsundownsyndrome is that even canon? didnt it only happen in the old cartoon
[5:21:40] <knotsundownsyndrome> @Afterman_ good point. i actually don't know.
[5:21:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Valentinius_Anodyne That's because the planet where Bao-Dur made his heroic sacrifice was cut from the game entirely
[5:21:46] <+Pswoofer> @patstaresat what kind of dog? It looks a lot like mine from what I can see
[5:21:52] <%averyoddjew> averyoddjew subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! UNLIMITED POWER (probably)
[5:21:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> So he just stops existing.
[5:21:56] <+xemnahort> @knotsundownsyndrome I forget their name but there is a Jedi who uses light side force lightning
[5:21:56] <%Dunmarkh> LUL
[5:21:57] <knotsundownsyndrome> it did only happen in the genndy cartoon
[5:21:58] <medril07> remember that cool brown alien jedi one of these things? he had a sonic scream
[5:22:10] <fuji_92> LUL
[5:22:10] <Broken_Sonex> If you think Bao-Dur is missing something to his character, that's because he literally is.
[5:22:18] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Too_Much_Nukie I'm aware actually! Real shame too
[5:22:26] <%cvp5127> like that one henchmen in batman
[5:22:37] <huskarl_zap> @medril07 that was clone wars
[5:22:41] <+SinisterBroccoli> this one is NOT smart
[5:22:46] <%thatfeel> @xemnahort Plo Koon uses an ability called force judgement which is basically just lightning
[5:22:47] <Darkred28> FeelsBadMan He was only doing his job
[5:22:47] <RiverBirch> jesus christ
[5:22:47] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> don't you need dark side knowledge to block force lightning? sheev is the only other person that can do that
[5:22:48] <%Blank9> he stopped you
[5:22:49] <Grandma_Amari> LUL
[5:22:52] <%CatastropheCorvid> Missed a Dark Side option

[5:22:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Nice try, Corpse (Nothing)
[5:23:01] <%Monkeyweed21> Ithorians aren't people
[5:23:02] <RiverBirch> This is why I, as a cashier, fear the Karen.
[5:23:02] <ChungusQuest> Ithorians don't count as people, I guess
[5:23:09] <%DemonOfSalt> Nope
[5:23:09] <%CatastropheCorvid> Have to say you're taking everything
[5:23:13] <%DemonOfSalt> woolieONEGUY
[5:23:13] <Grandma_Amari> There's not enough stuff like that in SWTOR, where some idiot tries to stop you and you can MURDER HIM.
[5:23:15] <+Pyroclase> Pat freaking out he wasn't evil enough lmao
[5:23:16] <medril07> Pat put him to sleep with force lightning
[5:23:17] <%CatastropheCorvid> IIRC
[5:23:18] <%AzureGale> panik
[5:23:21] <%DemonOfSalt> You get the reward at the end.

[5:23:30] <fuji_92> DARK SIDE? SoonerLater
[5:23:32] <huskarl_zap> SilverSuffer
[5:23:33] <%CatastropheCorvid> I might be wrong, but I just played this, so I'm fairly sure
[5:23:45] <%Dunmarkh> SHOULD HAVE STOLEN MORE
[5:23:46] <%Alazull> More Dark
[5:23:51] <G03933> remember chat, if someone trys to stop you from stealing, its ok to kill them
[5:23:56] <CursedNobleman> Zagreus?
[5:23:56] <%luftraumm1> ok tyshiphone
[5:23:57] <ChungusQuest> No, you didn't revel enough in that murder. Wasted opportunity
[5:23:57] <%DemonOfSalt> You get Dark Side when you turn in the stolen property.
[5:24:02] <CursedNobleman> Zaaaagreeeeeus?
[5:24:03] <medril07> Hey Majima your dancing sucks, I'll kill you
[5:24:05] <fuji_92> didnt steal enough to be dark
[5:24:08] <%CatastropheCorvid> Plenty more opportunities. You're already doing very well, DS point wise.
[5:24:12] <Broken_Sonex> "I gotta - but- but - i don't how to...!"
[5:24:13] <%RaziWraith> but if you say that you are going to do it first, then it's premeditated murder. That's worse right? :)
[5:24:28] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He's an upstanding business man.
[5:24:29] <medril07> Pat is playing as a yakuza npc
[5:24:32] <%SirGO0SE> this guy speaks our language
[5:24:39] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> @RaziWraith only if you aren't politically motivated
[5:24:53] <+xemnahort> @grandma_amari I remember one moment in swtor where I try to leave a planet with someone and the race police complain about him ever leaving the planet alive, so my character literally sighs while facepalming and then casually points lightning at them to kill them
[5:24:57] <Broken_Sonex> HE IS A LEGIT BUSNESS MAN. NO BULL
[5:25:08] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Why is it so easy and fast to be evil in this game? You clear quests ten times faster evil
[5:25:19] <+xemnahort> @grandma_amari race police may have been the wrong wording
[5:25:24] <%Alazull> Big fan of money and opportunities to evil
[5:25:33] <%linSP> haha lightning go brrrr
[5:25:33] <%DemonOfSalt> @XeroSigmaPrime Because that's the Dark Side.
[5:25:35] <%logoth_> Is that the zapping system?
[5:25:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> LUL
[5:25:38] <knotsundownsyndrome> race police is the exact right wording in SWTOR's context
[5:25:44] <%Too_Much_Nukie> LET ME SEE YOUR PASSPORT
[5:25:46] <Broken_Sonex> @XeroSigmaPrime That's the point.
[5:25:47] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> because the default design for morality games is that bad=do shit faster and get more money
[5:25:49] <medril07> You rebel scum
[5:25:52] <Commander_Spyke> Because being a good guy is genuinely difficult
[5:25:59] <huskarl_zap> i hate mmos
[5:26:05] <%thatfeel> The Dark Side is the quick and easy route to more power..

[5:44:13] <%Futurecity10> never
[5:44:16] <%XeroSigmaPrime> We wont get an RPG, we will probs get something like Fallen Order
[5:44:18] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> fallen order is really dang cool but it's a different genre
[5:44:19] <%king_wragles> Keep saying that Pat, I'm hoping Crazy Talk will help us out
[5:44:30] <olaksi> @Broken_Sonex I was about to say once Disney dies, so both are true
[5:44:30] <%Davion_Salkovich> go play tabletop rpgs if you want this
[5:44:31] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Kreia says: Save your game
[5:44:33] <%Ranryu692> I'd be content with a Fallen Order sequel (though I'd prefer Titanfall 3)

[5:45:15] <dinnydanny777> The Karen thing to do would be to ask questions
[5:45:15] <%thatfeel> The door is open again
[5:45:29] <Broken_Sonex> @DickieWoodsmall_279 Fallen Order is the Star Wars game i didn't want.
[5:45:29] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> unfortunately FO2 will probably be tainted by the hand of EA since the last one actually did well
[5:45:35] <+reallybigrocks> That's so sad, fallen order was real good but a deep RPG like this but with modern polish would get my dick so hard
[5:45:41] <+MisterAvry> "see, you say that..."
[5:46:04] <+Spoonsire> So anyways, I started zappin
[5:46:27] <%thatfeel> I just want EA to lose the Star Wars license
[5:46:31] <%Ranryu692> wow look how evil Atton already is
[5:46:43] <ChungusQuest> "I smell burnt meat. Did we just make money?"
[5:46:47] <%Ranryu692> I forgot how quickly he can fall lol
[5:46:51] <Coystick> Heh, she's casting that with her stump
[5:47:09] <+reallybigrocks> @thatfeel even just letting other studios at it would be enough, no reason for it to be totally exclusive
[5:47:13] <%AzureGale> I GET IT
[5:47:14] <+LionKagura> FailFish
[5:47:19] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> @thatfeel they won't they already have it and they're just as willing as any other publisher to milk it by any means
[5:47:25] <+LionKagura> Booo
[5:47:29] <Broken_Sonex> Unless....EA...Disney....and whoever go under, there won't be good Star Wars stuff anymore
[5:47:29] <olaksi> Karen would have complained
[5:47:43] <%thatfeel> @reallybigrocks Exactly
[5:47:59] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> why would disney give it to someone who would potentially make compromises to profits in the interest of making a good game
[5:48:24] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it's free money
[5:48:35] <%TheMattman1313> YEYEYE
[5:48:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> buh boh
[5:48:38] <dinnydanny777> Atton HATES gambling and LOVES murder
[5:48:40] <olaksi> jeez atton, use some moisturizer

[5:48:41] <RiverBirch> ATTON
[5:48:42] <+pally_din> Lookin a little crusty there
[5:48:45] <RiverBirch> YOU NEED MOISTERIZER
[5:48:45] <+MisterAvry> get some vitamin D buddy
[5:48:45] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> no, loot boxes and dlc are free money
[5:48:47] <%thatfeel> Why is being a Star Wars fan suffering these days
[5:48:48] <%DemonOfSalt> woolieKICKDAD woolieSHOOK
[5:48:50] <Broken_Sonex> Looking a little crusty, man...
[5:48:53] <%Davion_Salkovich> Davion_Salkovich subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! lack of control more like lack of not eating candy
[5:48:55] <huskarl_zap> atton got Sion beat
[5:49:01] <+reallybigrocks> Disney has the money it's just a matter of sending it to the right people. The series they have lined up seem like they're gonna be good, I can only hope they'll see the same success with their games
[5:49:07] <%DemonOfSalt> @thatfeel Too true.
[5:49:10] <RiverBirch> Atton needs some Aloe
[5:49:12] <MagusTheSleepy> Get this man some lotion!
[5:49:14] <%TheMattman1313> You ready for the hate-fuck where two gross dust piles just shift on each other @PatStaresAt ?
[5:49:20] <%MidnightBurst12> atton's hitting that dark side hard
[5:49:23] <MildMannered_Creighton> Get Atton a bag for his face
[5:49:24] <%DemonOfSalt> @reallybigrocks EA is more of the problem than Disney IMO.
[5:49:28] <%bread_assassin> Pat's playing like he's a random enemy in a Yakuza substory.
[5:49:30] <huskarl_zap> flintstones chewables
[5:49:41] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> they literally don't care about making star wars shit that's quality, they want star wars shit that makes money and ea knows exactly how to exploit the fans
[5:49:42] <subjectg> @thatfeel pretty much how being a fan of any of the big sc fi franchises these days is like. star wars, mass effect, halo, star trek....
[5:49:46] <olaksi> steady cracking sounds
[5:49:50] <%DemonOfSalt> @reallybigrocks EA is responsible for TOR in the first place.
[5:49:57] <Broken_Sonex> @reallybigrocks Man, I'm WATING for The Mandalorian to fucking flop.
[5:49:57] <%Monkeyweed21> does Kae'ryns puss just full of lightning?
[5:50:01] <Darkred28> Agreed
[5:50:09] <Coystick> Paradong or Gaterade
[5:50:10] <ChungusQuest> so you want to be Nihilus
[5:50:11] <%SirGO0SE> PsychoPat
[5:50:20] <+canseesea> You should check out Tyranny, it gives you multiple flavors of psychotic
[5:50:23] <%cylish> yeah in mass effect you were just a racist dick
[5:50:24] <%DemonOfSalt> @reallybigrocks Disney didn't do TOR, EA did that along time ago.
[5:50:25] <%Maids4lyfe> I love eating orphans!
[5:50:29] <+reallybigrocks> @DemonOfSalt EA now is a different beast from when these game came out
[5:50:32] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> ME2 did it better than ME
[5:50:40] <$RealThiele> rob from the rich, and give to myself
[5:50:42] <AEnemyStandUser> Pat doesn't like anti-heroes confirmed
[5:50:44] <olaksi> i'll start watching the mandalorian when they kill baby yoda
[5:50:48] <Ids560> Renegade is just so weird and inconsistent across the games
[5:50:52] <Broken_Sonex> Renegade was just not being an idealistic idiot
[5:50:53] <%RaziWraith> Badass for the greater good? Maybe in Mass Effect 1 and 2. Mass Effect 3 Renegade Shep is a fuckin idiot sometimes LUL
[5:50:56] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt Did you ever play Pyre on stream? (just got into it, it's really good)

[5:51:25] <Commander_Spyke> I have one bullet, where do you want it?
[5:51:26] <+reallybigrocks> *can't go wrong
[5:51:31] <Coystick> The set up for ME2 incentivises renegade
[5:51:33] <Commander_Spyke> Best line from ME2
[5:51:33] <%Davion_Salkovich> way of the fuck it up
[5:51:44] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Renegade in 1 and 2 is smart. Renegade in 3 makes some fucking idiotic decisions
[5:51:51] <olaksi> ME1 is weird in that the game will still suck your dick for being a racist asshole
[5:51:55] <+reallybigrocks> They genuinely care about making something that the fans will like because they're fans themselves
[5:51:56] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> ME2 pushing a dude out a window is the best Renagde
[5:52:03] <Darkred28> We'll bang, okay?
[5:52:05] <dinnydanny777> I hope that when you get to negative influence with Kreia there is an underflow glitch

[5:54:07] <Broken_Sonex> @Monkeyweed21 That sounds like an insult.
[5:54:23] <%murdock_465> I dunno
[5:54:24] <highfivesquash> oh my god this fucking music
[5:54:24] <+reallybigrocks> What do yall think was the last really good RPG that came out, I feel like I've been starved for a game that gives you real freedom to play your own character
[5:54:36] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> @Broken_Sonex and one that's deserved
[5:54:38] <huskarl_zap> keep saying slusk
[5:54:57] <subjectg> I’m also partial to when you take Legion aboard the quarian ship and shep’s all like “When I take Tali aboard council stations they sometimes call her ‘that thing’”

[5:55:10] <+pally_din> Slusk is almost as scummy of a name as Dog-eyes
[5:55:12] <Commander_Spyke> Divinity 2 is great

[6:00:54] <+reallybigrocks> @Broken_Sonex I think it's more a matter of not feeling like I'm truly in control of the character. I definitely prefer a 1st/3rd person perspective like fallout/elder scrolls even if they aren't 'hardcore' rpgs

[6:10:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can't ask her anything important until you reach the ship though.
[6:10:34] <CursedNobleman> umadkreia? LUL
[6:10:37] <Commander_Spyke> Why are you making Kreia so mad? pvpLUL
[6:10:46] <+reallybigrocks> Honestly Star Citizens end goal is like my ideal if so much of it wasn't reliant on mutiplayer, just a game where the progression is mainly based on your personal goals rather than an overarching plot. Altho that's probably a bit unrealistic in terms of development
[6:10:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Level 15
[6:11:00] <cronos0101011> how can u out karen the boss of karens
[6:11:00] <%thatfeel> 15
[6:11:06] <subjectg> @patstaresat you may need to wait til she’s on the ship
[6:11:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> The level cap is 50. Most people end the game around 30.
[6:11:16] <Commander_Spyke> @reallybigrocks Sounds like you wanna play Runescape
[6:11:25] <olaksi> LUL
[6:11:27] <%Ranryu692> what did you think would happen?
[6:11:29] <%MidnightBurst12> eww
[6:11:30] <huskarl_zap> psure lul
[6:11:31] <subjectg> oops
[6:11:32] <fuji_92> NOOOOOOO
[6:11:33] <%cvp5127> LUL
[6:11:33] <Commander_Spyke> WHAT A NICE GUY
[6:11:37] <Broken_Sonex> GOTTA KILL EM
[6:11:39] <ygtidal> LUL
[6:11:57] <i_am_therydon> you leave him to starve
[6:11:57] <subjectg> iirc there’s no way to kill him, you can call him names though
[6:11:58] <Broken_Sonex> I think that's a mod
[6:12:00] <fuji_92> u can't I guess
[6:12:01] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> more evil to let ihm starve and die in his own shit and cum
[6:12:10] <+reallybigrocks> @Commander_Spyke Like I said before though, I just have an issue with the isometric perspective. I don't feel like I'm really in control of the character
[6:12:18] <%TheMattman1313> Let him starve in the cage I guess
[6:12:21] <+lucidrush> Anybody here know anything about wasteland 2?
[6:12:27] <+xemnahort> Really I could’ve sworn killing him was a thing
[6:12:29] <%Ranryu692> yeah, I think you just kinda... leave him there
[6:12:30] <moonmintparadise> shit and die himself
[6:12:33] <%Monkeyweed21> die himself?
[6:12:43] <%king_wragles> "I guess he's just going to shit and die himself then" @PatStaresAt , 01/09/21
[6:12:51] <+xemnahort> Oh I was thinking of the guy in KOTOR 1
[6:12:51] <%Dementedpenguin> bless
[6:12:53] <ammobasket> dye himself?
[6:12:55] <%miguelrod777> snore go brr
[6:13:02] <+LionKagura> The fuck was that noise WutFace
[6:13:09] <%DemonOfSalt> cheer500 You're ability to roleplay in this game is excellent due to all the shades of light, grey, & dark. During Woolie's LP and after, I played three distinct characters: A "Light Side" Sith Lord, a Sith Assassin that was a jerk to everyone except for party members, and a Jedi punchgirl who was good to a fault. And now after watching Woolie's unique lightside character I get to watch your unique darkside character too! It's great!
[6:13:09] <Commander_Spyke> @reallybigrocks You really only see other players in Runescape, but you can do just about everything solo
[6:13:10] <+reallybigrocks> @PatStaresAt what was that fuckin sneeze yo haha
[6:13:16] <Broken_Sonex> Get some cream for your face, man. Jesus...
[6:13:19] <+firelink_dweller> Hey pat how much longer you going tonight?
[6:13:28] <ApeDb3> SeemsGood
[6:13:28] <%FacetiousAF> cool big man with cool big hands
[6:13:29] <cronos0101011> atton belongs on the ship, not freedom
[6:13:33] <+reallybigrocks> @PatStaresAt you're the coolest biggest man Pat
[6:13:35] <+pally_din> Name 1 person who looks cool when they sneeze
[6:13:39] <%justcallmebobplease> A cool big man with the most macho of sneeze-squeaks.
[6:14:19] <+reallybigrocks> @Commander_Spyke I just prefer a first/third person perspective over point and click fixed camera gameplay
[6:14:22] <fuji_92> TIME TO FUCK CZERKA
[6:14:27] <dinnydanny777> Asking a Karen to be reasonable LUL
[6:14:47] <Broken_Sonex> You're the biggest little man ever Pat.....besides Rey Misterio
[6:14:54] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> do you guys think shinji washed his hand after the opening scene in EoE or is he the kinda shithead that would just wipe it on his pants or something?
[6:15:13] <dinnydanny777> Anyone who uses "do-gooders" as a pejorative is evil
[6:15:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He totally wiped it on Asuka's hair.
[6:15:17] <+reallybigrocks> Like Skyrim minus the main plot with more fleshed out side stories would be my favorite game of all time
[6:15:18] <%justcallmebobplease> What reasonable capitalism, here.
[6:15:19] <@SoFarFetched> Probably washed his hands in shame.
[6:15:24] <%justcallmebobplease> Clearly, Czerka is a good guy.
[6:15:33] <Broken_Sonex> Wait.....is Rey Misterio taller than pat?
[6:15:35] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> hey why'd my icon change?
[6:15:48] <Commander_Spyke> ???
[6:15:48] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> twice?
[6:16:02] <CursedNobleman> man, that is some seriously evil statuary
[6:16:05] <%justcallmebobplease> Pat, make a manly voice to counterbalance the squeaking.
[6:16:07] <fuji_92> KILL EVERY FUCKING ITHORIAN
[6:16:11] <%justcallmebobplease> A gutteral utterance will suffice.
[6:16:13] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> it turned into a little star up there. is it because i talked about cum?
[6:16:22] <huskarl_zap> the statues are from Korriban
[6:16:56] <+reallybigrocks> @justcallmebobplease Pat's a solid tenor though, IDK if a gutteral utterance is in his biology
[6:17:24] <%Alazull> Sold your soul to the corps, for profit and evil fun!
[6:17:33] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Which planet are you going to first/
[6:17:37] <%dekkitout> Need or want?
[6:17:38] <cronos0101011> has pat played jade empire? id love to see that
[6:17:42] <huskarl_zap> youll get one soon
[6:17:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> dawn too een
[6:18:01] <Broken_Sonex> Not Nar Shaddaa?
[6:18:04] <Rocko72> PogChamp
[6:18:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Also you'll get Mical.
[6:18:10] <@SoFarFetched> You still doing good Pat? At 6 hours for streaming.
[6:18:11] <%FacetiousAF> 👀 darksiders?
[6:18:27] <fuji_92> wait really... I always go to nar shadaa first... that will b cool to see
[6:18:28] <huskarl_zap> pretty sure this mod gives you one on telos
[6:18:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's space Michael.
[6:18:33] <Commander_Spyke> Nar Shaddaa is probably the best planet
[6:18:37] <%FacetiousAF> fine
[6:18:38] <+pally_din> SeemsGood
[6:18:39] <%Blank9> good sound
[6:18:42] <fuji_92> ok
[6:18:43] <%Dementedpenguin> It's fine.
[6:18:44] <%AzureGale> It's been good
[6:18:45] <%VoidBaronJules> nah sounds been good all stream
[6:18:46] <%king_wragles> Sound has been consistent the entire stream @PatStaresAt
[6:18:46] <%Dakuu75> Sound has been perfect.
[6:18:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> youve been on mute for the last few hours
[6:18:49] <%Alazull> It's been good

[6:19:01] <ApeDb3> 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
[6:19:02] <%Ranryu692> game dialogue is a little low, but otherwise everything is perfect
[6:19:05] <%StaceMcGate> good sound, you don't have the same sound issues woolie did the remastered version
[6:19:10] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> the mic audio is kind of irritating but I don't think that's because of a bug
[6:19:13] <amonimis> !uptime
[6:19:14] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 6h 19m.
[6:19:45] <%king_wragles> DAMN

[6:20:08] <%MidnightBurst12> gottem
[6:20:12] <Coystick> The mic audio will never recover
[6:20:29] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt I think you can also get a lightsaber fast on Nar Shaddaa, if you kill that one guy like Woolie did.
[6:20:32] <+reallybigrocks> @PatStaresAt I can tell lmao
[6:20:36] <leinadtonu> What is a compressor?
[6:20:42] <TofuNyan> @PatStaresAt I appreciate you, Glad you've been streaming today. And I hope you've had a fun stream so far <3
[6:20:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You don't have to kill that guy.
[6:20:52] <%thatfeel> Sounds good
[6:20:54] <HorribleHog> there's like the faintest crackle
[6:20:56] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can get a lightsaber from any planet, Dantooine is fastest for evil characters.
[6:21:05] <%Ranryu692> no
[6:21:07] <Broken_Sonex> @Too_Much_Nukie Yeah, but Dark Side.

[6:21:25] <Coystick> Mic audio go burrrrrr
[6:21:27] <+reallybigrocks> @PatStaresAt exactly. As soon as NPCs stop talking the background sound comes way up and you're audible above all of it
[6:21:27] <%Ranryu692> we're assholes
[6:21:28] <%Dakuu75> "there's a weird line on the left side of the screen though"

[6:22:13] <olaksi> there must always be a one guy
[6:22:20] <Beatless_Rain4998> pat, do you see the line at the bottom of your screen?

[6:22:41] <KaitlynnHere> Flab
[6:22:42] <Grandma_Amari> She looks viably disgusted.
[6:22:51] <huskarl_zap> why the fuck would they tell
[6:23:01] <%Dakuu75> also, why did Pat flip the stream-layout?
[6:23:01] <KaitlynnHere> Ly
[6:23:04] <+reallybigrocks> @PatStaresAt You could maybe ease up on the compression a bit but the levels are fine
[6:23:06] <+Lunchb0xx> damn I miss this game
[6:23:08] <subjectg> There’s a really good set of em coming up
[6:23:11] <%VoidBaronJules> flavoured yes/no
[6:23:18] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt What's more upsetting, game audio slightly louder than you, or a gray line at the corner of the screen?
[6:23:25] <%VoidBaronJules> tassty tasty yes/no
[6:23:26] <+zeraux_> its fine
[6:23:27] <fuji_92> yes; yes (lie); no; no (lie)
[6:23:32] <ChungusQuest> "lol sure" is always a superior option to a simple "yes"

[6:23:36] <%thatfeel> Pat the Lier
[6:23:38] <+xemnahort> @broken_sonex ok so the only game I can think of after much deliberation is overlord 2

[6:24:14] <KaitlynnHere> This is ok
[6:24:18] <%debugdrawray_> this fucking camera angle
[6:24:19] <+reallybigrocks> @PatStaresAt I'm just being nitpicky at this point, the most important thing is that the game isn't overpowering your voice and isn't so quiet that you can't hear it
[6:24:21] <+Lunchb0xx> steal all his shit
[6:24:24] <+ChainsawBees> burn em all
[6:24:25] <%debugdrawray_> screaming at eachother
[6:24:36] <KaitlynnHere> I’m going to sue you to death! How dare you!

[6:27:30] <+GuilKato> the ithorians who talk soooooo bloodyy slowly
[6:27:33] <+xemnahort> @patstaresat the ithorians hired them to kill you and czerka

[6:30:14] <KaitlynnHere> You need to go Karen her
[6:30:17] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt So NORMALLY you go to the docks and Jana Lorso calls you to let you know Czerka HQ is under siege by mercs, asking you to come back and save her.
[6:30:25] <subjectg> @too_much_nukie it’s also worthless because it’s bugged, sadly
[6:30:31] <%FacetiousAF> gonna karen the whole goddamn station at this rate
[6:30:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @subjectg Not in restored content it's not.
[6:30:44] <+reallybigrocks> So chat, back on the finding me an RPG i'll like discussion. What's the persona gameplay like? fairly standard turn based JRPG fare or is it different?
[6:30:52] <KaitlynnHere> Fuck
[6:31:01] <subjectg> @too_much_nukie oh they fixed it, didn’t know that
[6:31:03] <KaitlynnHere> She was excited about that

[6:32:06] <Teras_ode> nintendo ninjas
[6:32:10] <ammobasket> -_-
[6:32:10] <Broken_Sonex> @reallybigrocks The thing with Persona combat is that you have to finish the fight in as little terns as possible.
[6:32:15] <+DrFacilier> @Dunmarkh as horrible as that is thats my fuckin favorite
[6:32:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I don't remember if this changes the reward.
[6:32:25] <%bread_assassin> Fun Fact: Coca Cola once hired assassins to kill off union leaders.
[6:32:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I assume it doesn't?
[6:32:33] <%logoth_> lol
[6:32:37] <+xemnahort> @reallybigrocks the combat gets much more streamlined as you go on with the main gameplay loop being to find out the enemy weakness and exploit it to prevent their turns and give you more opportunities for attacks with disabling all enemies in this way allowing for a free full team attack
[6:32:56] <KaitlynnHere> @bread_assassin I mean like, they were just doing their job kappa
[6:33:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Fun fact: the pinkertons fired into crowds of civilians to break up protesting workers.
[6:33:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> dog loud
[6:33:22] <%XeroSigmaPrime> How do you think Disney acquired Fox? Guarantee atleast 5 people got beheaded
[6:33:26] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's about half of the intended end level.
[6:33:27] <+ChainsawBees> wheres zangief
[6:33:28] <Grandma_Amari> Is the dog PURRING?
[6:33:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Game is designed so you end around level 30.
[6:33:38] <bigcatryan> Pat has played this correct?
[6:33:47] <+xemnahort> @reallybigrocks as you go on as in games the games don’t really change gameplay much during the playthrough except in the case of making new personas though p5 does add some extra mechanics later on
[6:33:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He has but it was years ago.
[6:34:06] <+zeraux_> NO KILL HER
[6:34:11] <%debugdrawray_> doing business
[6:34:12] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> she looks like an alien doing what she thinks facial expressions are SUPPOSED to look like
[6:34:15] <+zeraux_> murder them all
[6:34:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> 2006 was 15 years ago.
[6:34:19] <bigcatryan> 2006 wasn't 15 years ag- wait...
[6:34:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> orz
[6:34:21] <$Quiet__Viking> I was 8 in 2006
[6:34:28] <Coystick> >2006 was 15 years ago AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
[6:34:29] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Wait you can kill all of em at Czerka?
[6:34:30] <Darkred28> I was nine in 2006
[6:34:31] <@SoFarFetched> time to feel old
[6:34:33] <RandyFistburgers> Thats a whole persons worth of time
[6:34:34] <%ssjklyco> oh god, 2006 is 15 years ago ow
[6:34:35] <+UnabashedGarbage> Fuck, don't tell me that. It's only been like 5 years in my head.
[6:34:36] <bigcatryan> I was 13
[6:34:37] <+reallybigrocks> @xemnahort sounds interesting but not really my thing. I might give it a shot at some point but it seems like a big commitment for something I won't enjoy that much
[6:34:43] <fuji_92> if he kills her theres a risk he'll get lightside
[6:34:43] <Broken_Sonex> IWAS 7 IN 2006
[6:35:01] <fuji_92> BUT THE ITHORIANS? KILL EM ALL IF U CAN
[6:35:08] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> I was getting ready to transfer my soul into my next young taut victim
[6:35:09] <+zeraux_> glory kill them all
[6:35:18] <+xemnahort> @reallybigrocks I mean it sounds more interesting than I’m making it sound but I can’t make you play it or anything
[6:35:26] <+reallybigrocks> Youtube is now older than the internet was when youtube started
[6:35:30] <+zeraux_> sweep the legs and punchem on the way down
[6:35:45] <%Ranryu692> @reallybigrocks fuck
[6:35:58] <fuji_92> time to leave this hellhole I assume
[6:35:58] <+xemnahort> @reallybigrocks though I should say that combat is not the main time spent in persona it’s mainly spent socializing with characters
[6:36:01] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> there has been a longer gap of time between now and skyrim's release than morrowind's and skyrim's release
[6:36:02] <%Too_Much_Nukie> 1 of 3
[6:36:29] <%Monkeyweed21> the smuggle
[6:36:30] <%Ranryu692> Skyrim's 10 year anniversary is this November
[6:36:30] <%AzureGale> But for me, it was Tuesday
[6:36:33] <+projectmanatees> do people like the ebon hawk as a ship? or is it just another star wars ship
[6:36:38] <akitanito> is that dio's line of not remember how many breads you've eaten?
[6:36:49] <%SirGO0SE> i think the ebon hawks p rad
[6:36:55] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I've seen a lot of people praising the ebon hawk's design.
[6:36:56] <fuji_92> the ebon hawk is fine
[6:36:58] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> it's just a cool name for a ship
[6:37:03] <%Monkeyweed21> I prefer the Ebonics Hawk, it has better music
[6:37:03] <+xemnahort> @projectmanatees not even top 5 in Star Wars
[6:37:04] <T_Sasquatch> @projectmanatees as long as its a named ship , people will like it
[6:37:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Plasma torch instantly bashes doors.
[6:37:11] <Broken_Sonex> I like that. "Oh. yeah....i forgot i kill someone in here."
[6:37:15] <%Ranryu692> it's fucking great, though

[6:38:19] <+reallybigrocks> @xemnahort fair enough, although character interactions aren't what really draw me to RPGs, seems like my best bet at this point is to wait for the next elder scrolls and mod the fuck out of it

[6:39:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> For Atton you HAVE to do the event on Nar Shadaa where you learn about his past.
[6:39:11] <rsg220> be on the safe side and murder more innocents
[6:39:11] <$DocMadfox> """Jedi"""

[6:44:53] <Moffin23> punch boy
[6:44:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> he punch
[6:45:01] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Bao-Dur is the best unarmed fighter you will get.
[6:45:02] <huskarl_zap> He maxes out his skills
[6:45:06] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Because you can't get Handmaiden.
[6:45:07] <+xemnahort> @fuji_92 one of 2 skill dump characters
[6:45:09] <fuji_92> he punches and is a skill dump
[6:45:14] <Broken_Sonex> He's a guardian if you make him a Jedi
[6:45:18] <cronos0101011> stronk punch
[6:45:19] <%DemonOfSalt> No need for weapons
[6:45:23] <huskarl_zap> Max out his int
[6:45:55] <Moffin23> so would he have an extendo arm or a rocket punch with that funky thing attached to his stump?
[6:46:18] <huskarl_zap> He cant wear alot of armors in the gane
[6:46:25] <+xemnahort> @moffin23 sadly neither but he does break barriers with it
[6:46:30] <Coystick> There should be light saber knuckle dusters
[6:46:30] <%logoth_> Alright give em the stick- DONT GIVE EM THE STICK
[6:46:30] <T_Sasquatch> extendo
[6:46:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He can also instantly destroy enemy shields.
[6:46:49] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt He does more damage unarmed.
[6:47:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat. Look at him
[6:47:06] <%Blank9> yeah
[6:47:07] <RiverBirch> HE'S A PUNCH BOY
[6:47:08] <MildMannered_Creighton> hes a true punchboi
[6:47:09] <%Blank9> he's unarmed expert
[6:47:10] <T_Sasquatch> @Coystick thats not how the FORCE works Kappa
[6:47:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> his metal arm
[6:47:11] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> he doesn't get joint cramps
[6:47:13] <akitanito> he's got a force power fist
[6:47:14] <$DocMadfox> He has a power fist, Pat.
[6:47:14] <Moffin23> he is a punch boy
[6:47:15] <Grandma_Amari> He's got a robot arm
[6:47:15] <%Blank9> and has a special punch command
[6:47:18] <%Dunmarkh> HE HAS A GIANT GLOWING ROBOT ARM
[6:47:18] <Moffin23> we told you this already
[6:47:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And he'll only do more unarmed damage as he levels up.
[6:47:26] <Gruhunchously> Big robot fist
[6:47:26] <Broken_Sonex> Also he can't use a lot of force powers since all he wear is armour. No robes. @PatStaresAt
[6:47:30] <Teras_ode> punch boi
[6:47:30] <Grandma_Amari> His arm has a special effect I think
[6:47:35] <%ssjklyco> He's ARMED to the teeth
[6:47:36] <ChungusQuest> Big iron on his stuuuuuuuump
[6:47:40] <T_Sasquatch> also to be fair having lightsaber gauntlets is a very dumb idea versus any regular light saber
[6:47:44] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> it's no wife arm but it'll do
[6:47:46] <%Blank9> he's cool
[6:47:57] <+zeraux_> HOW DOES BAO NOT HAVE A ROCKET PUNCH
[6:47:59] <El_GhostV1> His giant Woolie arm
[6:48:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> wtf was that noise
[6:48:14] <Gruhunchously> Granny has a gun
[6:48:22] <Broken_Sonex> HIS BIG GROSS WOOLIE ARM
[6:48:22] <%Blank9> I love that he whispers too
[6:48:24] <huskarl_zap> UUUauaghh
[6:48:25] <Moffin23> just one more piece of gear you don't have to worry about
[6:48:40] <+xemnahort> @t_sasquatch gauntlets yes but light saber brass knuckles sounds like a great idea
[6:48:55] <Gruhunchously> Nice skybox textures
[6:49:05] <+xemnahort> @zeraux_ 14 months
[6:49:08] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> pat has engaged GAMER POSTURE
[6:49:30] <+zeraux_> what?
[6:49:36] <Gruhunchously> Oh dear, they are not saving AT ALL
[6:50:06] <Gruhunchously> The enemies, that is.
[6:50:18] <+gWrath89> gWrath89 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[6:50:23] <+trackles_64> is this a remaster or something?
[6:50:24] <crocodiddler> What the fuck? Why didn’t anyone tell me Pat was playing KOTOR?!
[6:50:28] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> @zeraux_ he's predicting how long you have left to live maybe
[6:50:28] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt Would you be surprised to know Bao-Dur is Woolie's favourite character?
[6:50:34] <+xemnahort> I think I will start up a dark playthrough of this too and I’ll do something I’ve never done before and do onderon first
[6:50:39] <%logoth_> WHY
[6:50:40] <Gruhunchously> There's a hidden cache behind the shuttle
[6:50:52] <+GuilKato> baodur is everyones favourite character
[6:50:55] <+zeraux_> maybe
[6:51:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I'm partial to Visa Card
[6:51:13] <owazowski> Can confirm I fucking love baodur
[6:51:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> There's 3
[6:51:26] <Gruhunchously> Visa or MasterCard
[6:51:29] <+xemnahort> Another fun fact the iOS version of kotor 2 is compatible with the restored content mod
[6:51:29] <+zeraux_> 14 months is generous though
[6:51:32] <WaitHowDidIGetHere> Force gottagofast
[6:51:34] <Moffin23> funning that fast with both weapons out makes them look like they got a stick up their ass
[6:51:36] <crocodiddler> I am fast. I am very fast.

[6:53:42] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @Moffin23 He missed an evil opportunity lol
[6:53:46] <%logoth_> Baodur is the pub guy in a group who stands in the fire
[6:53:47] <+xemnahort> @zeraux_ game was made in 14 months
[6:53:47] <crocodiddler> Who the fuck is that horny guy following you around?
[6:53:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> low wisdom or whatever
[6:53:56] <+zeraux_> oh
[6:54:00] <+zeraux_> HAHAQHAHAH
[6:54:01] <Broken_Sonex> Yeah, he'll do that....run into mines.....
[6:54:04] <%vexion_smh> yeah run toward the mine WHAT COULD HAPPEN
[6:54:09] <huskarl_zap> this was taken out because there no way bao dur doesnt know about the galaxy wide jedi bounty
[6:54:09] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You can get maxed alignment before finishing your first planet.
[6:54:17] <Coystick> 14 isn't 18
[6:54:18] <+zeraux_> i thought it was some thing else entirely
[6:54:18] <Gruhunchously> "Never has there been a part of a game so dedicated to showing off it's own flaws than this section of Telos"
[6:54:24] <+xemnahort> @zeraux_ basically the reason for most of not all problems in the game which is why it’s an absolute miracle the game is still great
[6:54:24] <%FacetiousAF> @crocodiddler Bao-Dur, he's the same species as Darth Maul
[6:54:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> iunno
[6:54:30] <Coystick> Nvm

[6:54:32] <NeroInfinite> RNg isn't fair
[6:54:52] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You'll want force forms though.

[6:56:48] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You should load a save so you can get that conversation.
[6:57:04] <Gruhunchously> Yeah, there's a cutscene that's supposed to paly here but the combat interrupted it.
[6:57:06] <owazowski> God yes bao's VA is soooo smooth
[6:57:18] <Coystick> SEA GO BUURRRRRRRR
[6:57:19] <cronos0101011> not impotant
[6:57:24] <huskarl_zap> He talks about how good the ithorians are at restoring
[6:57:29] <olaksi> swooooosh
[6:57:32] <lessthanhuman_tv> speak up bao I can't hear you over the fucking 1000 decibel ocean sounds
[6:57:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> can you speak up, can't hear you over the crashing waves
[6:57:52] <cronos0101011> he just tells u to be careful cuz guys ahead
[6:57:58] <Broken_Sonex> The sea is eating his voice
[6:58:01] <Gruhunchously> SPLOOSH go the waves
[6:58:03] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> holy shit this is hilarious

[6:58:13] <+nirvana227> LUL
[6:58:19] <Gruhunchously> It's like it's being recorded on a cheap camcorder.
[6:58:29] <%SirGO0SE> i wonder if he can get that arm wet
[6:58:30] <HotMafia81> Soft, horni boi
[6:58:32] <%logoth_> This reminds me of that time you get to kill mission
[6:58:32] <+GuilKato> I think we have found that baodur believe *OCEAN* and that *OCEAN*
[6:58:36] <owazowski> SWOOOSH SPLASH
[6:58:40] <%SirGO0SE> or if he has to bag it like a cast
[6:58:46] <olaksi> that's not the ocean splooshing, it's half the chat reacting to bao
[6:58:49] <Broken_Sonex> BECAUSE ASMR
[6:58:51] <+trackles_64> His fighting style is DISCo
[6:58:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @SirGO0SE 😳

[6:59:10] <%FacetiousAF> slorp slorp slorp slorp slorp
[6:59:13] <HotMafia81> They turned his mic gain up way too high as a joke and he was too nervous to call them out on it
[6:59:16] <DianaTheAscian> WutFace WutFace WutFace
[6:59:16] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> holy shit the glowing part of his arm doesn't cast a shadow, is this game next gen?
[6:59:17] <huskarl_zap> slobberknocker
[6:59:21] <%justcallmebobplease> Getting sloppy with them jowls, is he?
[6:59:30] <+GuilKato> Red Rocket!
[6:59:30] <Broken_Sonex> They like to do that....
[6:59:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt There's another cash by the northern edge of this part of the map. Near a chasm.
[6:59:34] <+trackles_64> Remmber this isnt canon
[6:59:34] <ThatGuyThere03> I'd imagine his dispassioned speech could be like a Rambo thing
[6:59:40] <lessthanhuman_tv> gumjob Pog
[6:59:44] <+reallybigrocks> @PatStaresAt everyone talking about the ocean sounds is renewing my compression BS. Could probably do with lowering it to -8 or -6, as long as the limiter is set lower than your average voice mic level you should be fine no matter what
[6:59:50] <%justcallmebobplease> Do you think he has a preferred side of his jowls to put his red rocket in? ...I should go die now.
[6:59:52] <ThatGuyThere03> Yeah of course this isn't canon, it's good
[7:00:14] <owazowski> Canon doesn't deserve this greatness
[7:00:34] <lessthanhuman_tv> I think the sound mixing in this game is just absolutely fucked and there's nothing pat could do LUL
[7:00:40] <owazowski> Fuck it, we'll make our OWN CANON
[7:00:49] <NeroInfinite> is this a 24 hour stream? pogchamp
[7:00:52] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 🎺
[7:01:00] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> there's some cool shit in canon, like leia and huldo going to the 4th level on coruscant
[7:01:04] <%logoth_> DUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNnnnnnn
[7:01:07] <%Ranryu692> 14 months
[7:01:08] <cronos0101011> canon has Ma'Rey...this is too good for canon
[7:01:14] <CaptainKarite> 🎺
[7:01:43] <CaptainKarite> Alright we need one stock trumpet blast and that should cover a lot of it
[7:01:44] <%FacetiousAF> definitely over level 5
[7:01:45] <Gruhunchously> There this bit coming up with a minefield with turrets behind it. For minimum headaches you might want to just set everyone to stationary and give them ranged weapons.
[7:01:52] <fuji_92> 50 I guess
[7:01:59] <Broken_Sonex> I'm pretty sure Bao-Dur is supposed to be always having a quiet "NOTHING IS OVER, YOU DON'T JUST TURN IT OFF." thing going on
[7:02:04] <%DemonOfSalt> Go back, you only got one.
[7:02:06] <+reallybigrocks> @lessthanhuman_tv @PatStaresAt if the background sounds are drowning out NPCs then the compressor is probably too high, if the game is drowning out Pat then the limiter is probably too low
[7:02:11] <%DemonOfSalt> There were two.
[7:02:17] <%Futurecity10> pat knows to stop leveling at 15 right?
[7:02:19] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> ahsoka getting white lightsabers by healing red kyber crystals is also pretty dope and in canon
[7:02:30] <+AnthraxJohnson> Damn he’s still going
[7:02:30] <El_GhostV1> What *DUUUUUUuuun* makes you think this was rushed
[7:02:38] <owazowski> I'll drink to that
[7:02:40] <%FacetiousAF> pat knows how to stop dabbing but he doesn't
[7:02:47] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's just the audio of this game being like that.
[7:02:56] <%DemonOfSalt> Bao "ASMR" Durr.
[7:03:06] <owazowski> LUL it's just how this game is
[7:03:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Unfortunately there's turrets.
[7:03:16] <subjectg> i mean, have you been near to the ocean?
[7:03:20] <Gruhunchously> Careful, there are turrets on the other side

[7:03:33] <+reallybigrocks> @PatStaresAt fair enough lmao. I wish games put more effort into sound design, seems like it's low on the list of dev time but it's more important than a lot of people realize

[7:06:49] <%FacetiousAF> yeah moon is the ending Thank Yous next
[7:06:50] <%DemonOfSalt> @moonmintparadise He'll be back shortly.
[7:06:55] <huskarl_zap> thank you money
[7:07:17] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> my point is that the movies suck and all the good parts of star wars happen outside the movies in both legends and canon, it's not that one is just better because it predates the sequels
[7:07:35] <+reallybigrocks> @moonmintparadise gameplay over tho, just reading donos n shit at this point
[7:08:13] <cronos0101011> true but the sequels are a special kind of ass
[7:08:49] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> even the original trilogy is just "okay" though, extremely overrated at least
[7:08:54] <DianaTheAscian> Hey chat do people like that speed racer live action movie?
[7:09:03] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> I honestly can't sit through any of them anymore
[7:09:20] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Sir_Gawain_Lotsson subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months, currently on a 27 month streak! Glad Pat is streaming the KOTORs. I'm gonna go catch the VOD, have a good stream goblin man and various animals and mustard beings!
[7:09:29] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> but the SW games and comics are fucking killer, even clone wars and rebels are pretty good
[7:09:43] <+reallybigrocks> @DickieWoodsmall_279 the movies are mid-tier star wars for sure. Personally my favorite shit has all been touched by the amazingly dorky hand of Dave Filoni, granted I'm not much of a reader these days so I'm probably missing out on a lot of EU novels
[7:09:59] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> it works as literally everything except a movie franchise
[7:10:08] <+reallybigrocks> You have to respect the films for being the framework of the world though
[7:10:10] <%VoidBaronJules> @DianaTheAscian i wasn't particularly a fan of it even if it tried something different with the visuals
[7:10:26] <%FacetiousAF> i really don't think you people get it.

[7:10:33] <%FacetiousAF> this is your god now
[7:10:34] <cronos0101011> the originals did the heroes journey well tho. sequels were just hurr durr i can do anything cuz i feel like it and no growth

[7:15:59] <%TheMattman1313> It's all about those photons
[7:16:06] <%Monkeyweed21> just stick the microphone up your butt
[7:16:08] <@SoFarFetched> You can tell when someones shitty at audio vs someone really good at audio
[7:16:09] <%VoidBaronJules> Dry Sad but true
[7:16:11] <+reallybigrocks> For sure, it requires the ear of a musician and the brain of an IT specialist @PatStaresAt
[7:16:13] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> do you guys have any idea how hard it is to recreate the authentic sound of asscheeks clapping?
[7:16:20] <@SoFarFetched> as Ive personally seen someone at my work as an AV be shitty at audio
[7:16:26] <%SirGO0SE> thats what i say about good hockey defenseman- if you dont notice them all night theyre doing a good job
[7:16:32] <DianaTheAscian> galaxy eyes photon dragon
[7:16:47] <%FacetiousAF> oh fetched you're here. i gotta say you look nothing like a duck.
[7:16:56] <@SoFarFetched> geefBlank
[7:17:04] <%FacetiousAF> depressedSkeleton aka a delicious meal
[7:17:05] <@SoFarFetched> why would you say that
[7:17:18] <i_am_therydon> that shot was fuckin dumb
[7:17:21] <ChungusQuest> And like five planets exploding, all visible at once
[7:17:21] <+reallybigrocks> But it looked cool tho
[7:17:21] <%FacetiousAF> @SoFarFetched ducks can't type, silly
[7:17:24] <%Monkeyweed21> the shot that makes no sense
[7:17:25] <%TheMattman1313> Ye that's not how light works
[7:17:37] <%TheMattman1313> "BUT WHAT IF WE MADE IS BIGGER"
[7:17:38] <ChungusQuest> "Vulcan has no moon."
[7:17:51] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> bro you can hear the death star explode this shit ain't new
[7:17:54] <@SoFarFetched> @FacetiousAF geefHypers
[7:17:58] <i_am_therydon> it's literally just an upgraded uninspired death star
[7:18:06] <%Maids4lyfe> it's a "hyperspace" laser
[7:18:09] <%Ranryu692> we talking about Starkiller base?
[7:18:16] <%TheMattman1313> @PatStaresAt It takes light like an hour and a half just to get to Saturn
[7:18:16] <%Maids4lyfe> but it's still dumb
[7:18:22] <+GuilKato> it also doesn't ignite the planets atmosphere either
[7:18:23] <ChungusQuest> AND THEY COULD ALL SEE IT
[7:18:24] <RandyFistburgers> fuckin sun takes 8 min
[7:18:27] <+reallybigrocks> I hate that they had to wreck Iilum to make Starkiller base happen but whatever, Star Wars is dumb as fuck
[7:18:28] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> play space engine for a better idea
[7:18:32] <AEnemyStandUser> you remember when it destroyed that planet and force awakens that everyone thought it was Coruscant but it wasn't
[7:18:40] <%cvp5127> death star go pew
[7:18:44] <+GuilKato> firing that beam through the planets atmosphere
[7:18:45] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> space engine is free and will expand your mind
[7:18:48] <%SirGO0SE> light 2 slow
[7:18:49] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt doesn't the death star break as well by this logic?
[7:18:52] <ShichiNoBushi> It takes 8 minutes for sunlight to reach Earth.
[7:18:55] <cronos0101011> the sequels were uninspired wastes of time
[7:18:57] <T_Sasquatch> you didnt like the FLEET OF DEATH STARS ? LUL
[7:19:16] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> but how can you hear it explode in space though?
[7:19:24] <+UnabashedGarbage> @PatStaresAt Not to mention predicting the movement of the base itself and the planet they're aiming at along with the expansion of space in general.
[7:19:25] <%Maids4lyfe> yeah the death star moves
[7:19:31] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Death Star moves to where it needs to, Starkiller is a planet stuck in an orbit XD
[7:19:33] <DianaTheAscian> cool i never knew that
[7:19:39] <SoftLusca> Ho does it hyperjump
[7:19:46] <+reallybigrocks> @DickieWoodsmall_279 Space engine is wild, the crazier part is that the dev team was one guy for years and only recently became like a few guys
[7:19:48] <%TheMattman1313> Granted Lucas probably wasn't thinking about light time delays and orbital mechanics but eh
[7:20:02] <%Maids4lyfe> it has hyperdrive engines @SoftLusca just like everything else
[7:20:09] <SoftLusca> Wait, wouldn
[7:20:11] <+Tredecian> It would have made more sense for it to pop that systems star, but they need that dramatic shot of multi planet genocide
[7:20:11] <%FacetiousAF> psaGib
[7:20:14] <%whyskeywolfe> Eyes?
[7:20:18] <%TheMattman1313> Don't forget, you're here forever!
[7:20:21] <%FacetiousAF> the answer? Strident
[7:20:22] <%SirGO0SE> "ill never keep someone along that long"
[7:20:22] <%VoidBaronJules> shows run for 6 easy
[7:20:26] <+reallybigrocks> @SoftLusca Hyperdrives, Star Wars is space FANTASY, never forget
[7:20:31] <%NopeBadguy> @whyskeywolfe the sub eyes
[7:20:34] <%FacetiousAF> wolfe he means the sub icons
[7:20:35] <DianaTheAscian> do u have a 4 year eyeball?
[7:20:41] <DianaTheAscian> 4
[7:20:47] <%ElkRiverDog> Eh, just add tentacles or horns
[7:20:52] <%whyskeywolfe> Really good commentary too.
[7:20:53] <T_Sasquatch> 2 , 5 , 7 Best jojo parts , donnt @ me
[7:20:53] <%AzureGale> Damn son
[7:21:01] <CrypticMochi> Making some force astroid thrower would probably be better
[7:21:06] <+reallybigrocks> 2 1/2 hours?!?!
[7:21:27] <%Maids4lyfe> @CrypticMochi that was a super weapon in the expanded universe
[7:21:38] <cronos0101011> "the force is female" -hurr durr kenedy
[7:21:39] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> thanks again for the gift sub avkid
[7:21:42] <+reallybigrocks> that's wild and I've only ever watched playthroughs of Yakuza
[7:21:43] <CrypticMochi> Huh cool
[7:22:07] <%DemonOfSalt> woolieYE
[7:22:27] <%whyskeywolfe> There isn't really a "middle" when the Force empirically tells you if you're being evil.
[7:22:29] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Because apathy is death
[7:22:46] <%VoidBaronJules> SMT does it well
[7:22:48] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> you have to bounce back and forth constantly
[7:23:00] <%whyskeywolfe> Neutral is Become A Toilet.
[7:23:02] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> neutral is "tell my wife I said...hello"
[7:23:02] <%Futurecity10> I went neutral in kotor 1, it was pretty alright
[7:23:03] <%VoidBaronJules> cause its a choice between law and order
[7:23:05] <Djinnazz> it's not neutral, it's just not giving a fuck.
[7:23:09] <%VoidBaronJules> and chaos
[7:23:16] <Nootyman> true neutral
[7:23:20] <+Caidezes> But I like being chaotic.
[7:23:22] <DianaTheAscian> thats sounds fun
[7:23:38] <SoftLusca> Rescue the orphans and then make half of them kill the other half
[7:23:39] <DianaTheAscian> TRUE CHAOS
[7:23:40] <Nootyman> grey Jedi?
[7:23:45] <%AncelDeLambert> because "True Neutral" isn't neutral in NV, it's the personal freedom option
[7:23:50] <%FacetiousAF> god fuck real las vegas, especially with covid around
[7:23:50] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> who's the good faction in NV?
[7:23:53] <%MelBrooksKA> does smt count?
[7:23:56] <%DemonOfSalt> Best New Vegas end: Me, myself, and I
[7:23:57] <%Monkeyweed21> is he jerking off?
[7:24:07] <DianaTheAscian> prob
[7:24:08] <%DemonOfSalt> @DickieWoodsmall_279 New California Republic, kinda
[7:24:12] <+GuilKato> @SoftLusca ???? Don't you mean kill & EAT the the other half?
[7:24:24] <ChungusQuest> I can't think of any examples, but there's got to be an advantage to going True Neutral in Planescape Torment
[7:24:24] <%DickieWoodsmall_279> they're assholes though, they just don't do slavery
[7:24:24] <%AncelDeLambert> I had another game in my head that did neutral right, but I lost it
[7:24:30] <%AzureGale> Good night, folks
[7:24:32] <+reallybigrocks> @DickieWoodsmall_279 None of them because it's NUANCED
