[0:03:19] <$JJnAJjohnson> Cheer1000 Greetings, Goblin Emperor Pat! Im so HYPED to see you play this again, thanks for showing it off. Speaking of hype for games, would you consider sneaking a one-off stream of My Friend Pedro into your rotation sometime? It's $20 US on steam, you can blow through it in 3 hours if you ignore ratings (but its you, so...), the soundtrack BOPS, and it's indisputably the RADDEST 2.5D bang bang mc'shooty game ever made. Chat, back me up on this, anyone who's seen this game'll say it's worth it
[0:03:21] <RC_S3kshun8> Oh my god. @AngriestPat dude who animated that lol. It almost looks like Eli's style

[0:11:59] <Angry_Ev1L> it's hotter than eu RIGHT NOW lul
[0:12:00] <$cureneckbeard> 100 degrees celcius is BOIL WATER

[0:12:02] <MrDonTacos_> 🔥 monkaS 🔥
[0:12:02] <ActualNobody6400> it is many much degrees
[0:12:02] <starotter70> It was basically a stove

[0:12:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> Yeah that's over 00Fat load
[0:12:04] <%DexteraXIII> We need liquid cooling, quick, pour RedBull into the PC.
[0:12:05] <%arcaderabbit48> So is Outer Wilds like a "surprise eldritch bloodborne" scenario or what? I missed the olds tream and ahvent had a chance to watch it

Happy mind goblins nerd. apatDab
[0:12:06] <%EmiinV> so i think you should just convert the inside of your computer to a hotplate
[0:12:06] <Desertfishing> that's chickens done type of hot
[0:12:07] <+Micalica> Pat that's permanent damage
[0:12:07] <zamzoph> monkaS
[0:12:07] <Alphaetus_Prime> that's fucking boiling wtf
[0:12:08] <+Double_Tap_That> Hello Pat and chat
[0:12:08] <$DarkKnightGrave> !CORES AT RISK!
[0:12:09] <%liflamor> wow
[0:12:09] <+Walopoh> Boiling point
[0:12:09] <%AuksMattin> thats ridiculous
[0:12:10] <glaciusinfinite> that boiling point
[0:12:11] <%EmiinV> and cook with it
[0:12:12] <JJnAJjohnson> my pc gets really hot too, usually like 80C
[0:12:13] <beefomkers> WHAT THE FUCK
[0:12:14] <+ChancellorOfLights> pretty sure my system crashes at 80. how can it even run?
[0:12:15] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat 100 C is TJmax for your processor, meaning it was thermally throttling - slowing itself waaaayyy the fuck down so it doesn't overheat.
[0:12:18] <%weissguard> That's that making tea temp.
[0:12:21] <+Wakkadude21> DOUBLE IT
[0:12:24] <gslayer14> okay that was fine until it got over 100c
[0:12:25] <%segonian> so what you're saying is your CPU is fucked
[0:12:26] <%brave_sj> It's enough to take Pat's CPU TO THE BOILING POINT
[0:12:26] <chronotriggerhappy123> holy shit pat, are you sure your comp didnt spontaneously combust?
[0:12:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> *200F wtf is this stupid thing doing
[0:12:27] <%willjar313> That's almost as hot as an early 2010's AMD processor.
[0:12:29] <Ner234> M E L T
[0:12:29] <gslayer14> geez
[0:12:30] <Doodle_Taco> BIG MELT
[0:12:30] <+SudoKillUser> Get an open body case with positive pressure
[0:12:30] <Valdorick> Wait, 100 degrees C or F?
[0:12:31] <%fermentthegarbage> U can bake cookies for the baby in there dude
[0:12:31] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat melting is also turning off
[0:12:33] <$valriot> 100 Celsius is booking point cos WE USE LOGIC YOU YANKY FUCKS
[0:12:34] <%EmiinV> C
[0:12:34] <Desertfishing> meltdown WOO
[0:12:35] <+Walopoh> @AngriestPat 212 is the boiling point of water
[0:12:35] <dekkitout> So did you start fusing lighter elements in to heavier ones from the heat?
[0:12:40] <+SudoKillUser> And liquid cooling kit
[0:12:41] <BappoSama> wait
[0:12:42] <+Punchasaur> That would melt plastic components
[0:12:43] <%Divryne> Chernobyl CPU meltdown.
[0:12:44] <$cureneckbeard> 212F to pay respects
[0:12:44] <lloyddboy> pat had FAKE FANS
[0:12:45] <alrobot2014> so your pc turned into a grill
[0:12:46] <Macguffn> maybe use colder water?
[0:12:49] <+HunterInABox> Air cooling wins again
[0:12:52] <BappoSama> WTF is that new animation!??!
[0:12:53] <$RubberFistFight> EYYY I CALLED IT, I said it'd be a pump failure or a radiator clog!! YEAAAAAAA
[0:12:54] <Valdorick> Fx212
[0:12:56] <%AdmiralButtloaf> noctua is good
[0:12:56] <+Deano8817> just hose down your cpu
[0:12:57] <$TDotGoat> air fans best fans
[0:13:01] <Broooomy> just pour red bull over the processor to cool it
[0:13:02] <studleydoorite> just put Elmo on a wheel to power the pump
[0:13:09] <krikitbonez> i have all noctua fans
[0:13:13] <+ChancellorOfLights> Im jealous
[0:13:13] <%brave_sj> @valriot Fahrenheit is based on human temperature because humans are more important than water

[0:13:18] <%Typhaeon> Typhaeon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! AIO coolant can also evaporate over time. Glad you didn't have to pony up for a new CPU, and that nothing else was damaged. Welcome back!
[0:13:19] <Ner234> "Fixed"
[0:13:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pride1000 Woo! Time for more space mystery shenanigans. I love that the Nomai took the logic behind time-travel computing and applied it to a physical search problem. Just make a random-ass guess and loop back if that one doesn't pan out. You can do infinity guesses in no seconds.
[0:13:24] <%Divryne> BUT AT WHAT COST?!
[0:13:25] <%willjar313> That's why I use air cooling. Even if the fan dies, you still have a big fuck-off hunk of metal pulling heat from your CPU.
[0:13:29] <sosuke5> but money go down
[0:13:30] <Daxalog> Yes
[0:13:30] <%CJett92> Ya, its been not great
[0:13:31] <alrobot2014> yes

[0:14:36] <@SSaryn> Shill Time
[0:14:36] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat yeah it would have been that. When the CPU hit 100, processes would have halted. If OBS halts, then it's effectively the same as you stopping the stream, as far as twitch's RTMP server is concerned.

[0:29:28] <mattdel92> Retail is the realist shit you can ever have
[0:29:28] <%templar010> You worked in internet
[0:29:28] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Retail is the Dark Souls of Jobs
[0:29:29] <pochiyeah> did u work at a circus with that height? @AngriestPat Kappa
[0:29:29] <%Elemntion> @angriestpat what cup did you get to replace the one that killed itself?
[0:29:29] <%willjar313> My job forces me to push carts in the hot fucking sun.
[0:29:30] <%ElenaManetta> Retail is more exhausting than an office job
[0:29:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @GohanEgret I'll check it out
[0:29:34] <Doodle_Taco> "Goofy Youtube videos" As the guy in Evo said
[0:29:34] <asurite_warrior> @AngriestPat How much of your college experience helped land you here pat
[0:29:34] <%ElenaManetta> An office job, you can be alone.
[0:29:35] <Alphaetus_Prime> it's because you're one of the streamers that looks the least like they would be able to survive with a normal job
[0:29:36] <czeekyplays> Retail is way harder than a "real" job
[0:29:36] <+Wakkadude21> i got my first job last year and boy let me tell ya
[0:29:36] <%Rngiddion> Retail is too real, it pulls back the veil of interpersonal relationships
[0:29:38] <%Elemntion> cpu*
[0:29:40] <%SvenHolgersson> real jobs are for S U C K E R S
[0:29:41] <Rentixx> So you didn't like your job and you basically went home and played video games

[0:33:46] <%Gray_skies1993> yeah it's too good
[0:33:50] <%SvenHolgersson> But he's a MAFIA BOSS
[0:33:50] <+TheSaintJohn> that's why its at the end
[0:33:54] <$DarkKnightGrave> THE NO U POWER
[0:33:57] <EuropantLamprey> Which is why he got it at the end of the series
[0:33:57] <Sir_Carl> Part 5 has a lot of massively OP stands
[0:33:58] <$hatesdps> so inappropriate they sent him upstate
[0:34:00] <Graxe_> Giorno could fix EVERY problem. Except Eyes of Heaven, apparently.
[0:34:00] <Sokumotanaka> NAh it's carthaic
[0:34:00] <%SvenHolgersson> GANG S T A R
[0:34:00] <lloyddboy> "Naw"
[0:34:01] <%Deadpal> wait
[0:34:02] <+starkandstag> Giorno SUCKS
[0:34:03] <@SSaryn> Yeah but guess what, no ones gonna fuck with that
[0:34:03] <Alphaetus_Prime> well he's a huge fuckin criminal so
[0:34:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I feel it's more of Epitaph getting out of control rather than requiem
[0:34:06] <%Deadpal> could GER work on kars?
[0:34:06] <$El_Desperad0> Nah
[0:34:08] <%vaporousTippler> A smile better suits a hero.
[0:34:08] <+Deano8817> It's perfect for the son of Dio though
[0:34:09] <Sokumotanaka> He's maia
[0:34:09] <$XeroSigmaPrime> HES THE GOD FATHER THO
[0:34:11] <Caidezes> Not too mean for Mini Dio.
[0:34:11] <glaciusinfinite> Good thing giorno isn't a protagonist anymore
[0:34:12] <+Tokanova> He's not a hero, he's a crime boss
[0:34:13] <daedri> Consider whose son he is.
[0:34:14] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Nah man, heroes gotta get MEANER to the bad guys
[0:34:17] <Sokumotanaka> HE'S MAFIA
[0:34:18] <%arcaderabbit48> It makes Part 6 really weird, because now every episode I'll just be thinking "why doesn't Giorno just come in and solve the problem?"
[0:34:18] <%tinyswampthing> and thats why requim stands will never appear again
[0:34:22] <MyNameIsRasus> Look at this not a hero

[0:52:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> @elenamanetta Imagine all the hentai that will finally be unlocked for us westerners.
[0:52:35] <starotter70> I don't know if there's an accent I love to make fun of more than generic French Accents
[0:52:36] <+BishopBain> YOU ARE THE LAW! SwiftRage
[0:52:37] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat would monseigneur and connoisseur have the same meaning in this context? would it still result in lord of the mini hats?
[0:52:38] <%Nordguy> But AI is totally gonna solve everything
[0:52:41] <Hawkbone_> Skull Face will make us all speak one language before then
[0:52:41] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Doodle_Taco) (warning)
[0:52:42] <Smart_ZaK1> The world might be ravaged by climate change before that happens
[0:52:43] <%PauliusMaximus> PauliusMaximus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! woo 7 months, been getting back in to warframe but man is there alot of waiting when you play like a normie and dont spend money
[0:52:45] <%crimsonharvest> google translate would probably be more effective if it was translating voice lines instead of text
[0:52:46] <+yeeyeyee> @Punchasaur if you can't love a dog that drools everywhere, how can you love elmo?
[0:52:46] <pmtriox> it is
[0:52:52] <Guardiansaiyan> Can you HANDLE the TRUTH?!

[0:53:07] <+BishopBain> ...That doesn't sound good. That sounds bad!
[0:53:09] <+lag2993> that sounds like something a dumb person would say
[0:53:11] <%Deadpal> That name what.
[0:53:13] <starotter70> Everyone just needs to speak Esperanto
[0:53:17] <pmtriox> the bar exam ensures only the biggest assholes are lawyers
[0:53:17] <Doodle_Taco> Just think that you are Phoenix Wright
[0:53:17] <Pixel_gee> Classic pat

[0:53:45] <%CJett92> Thank you Bitch LUL
[0:53:46] <%arcaderabbit48> Eureka is a poor imitation of an aged system that time has taken a sledgehammer to
[0:53:48] <+Punchasaur> @yeeyeyee I don’t have to clean up after Elmo because he’s not my cat
[0:53:49] <+Tokanova> like AF1 artifacts?
[0:54:00] <%arcaderabbit48> Well. "Canonical"
[0:54:01] <Hyp3r4ctive> Eureka is the game mode for people who want to play ff11 with better graphics

[0:55:07] <InugamiTheHound> I wish I knew how to twitch. So I could be like you
[0:55:07] <iusetheinternet> twitch works through a complicated system of levers and pulleys
[0:55:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> apatWink
[0:55:08] <Ner234> Do shit get rich
[0:55:09] <%BlitzNeidhart> What's a Twitch?
[0:55:09] <%GohanEgret> it's just the part of the internet that's not porn
[0:55:16] <Tennochief> good thing there are never any Twitch mods here
[0:55:20] <%brave_sj> It's like YouTube except you have nowhere to hide your shame
[0:55:26] <MyNameIsRasus> @gohanegret there is no such thing
[0:55:28] <Louie_Salmon> @iusetheinternet Definitely some tubes and valves in there
[0:55:28] <Alphaetus_Prime> you see that shit where twitch banned a guy literally just because he had like 1000 subs and only streamed once a week?

[0:55:44] <Tennochief> reading 40k codices is fun
[0:55:44] <hntronium> When do you play DnD with Woolie
[0:55:45] <%arancet> pat pets elmo like a 5 year old with sticky fingers
[0:55:47] <%foreverN2dust> Dude, big feel FeelsBadMan

[0:55:50] <+Fenlig> ruining assholes
[0:55:53] <%SvenHolgersson> So everyone I play DnD with then
[0:55:54] <mankeyfigh> SAME
[0:55:54] <%EmiinV> if you survive that long, pat
[0:55:55] <%Frost_Quill> I've wanted to play games like D&D for years and years now but I don't have a group.

[0:55:57] <%snow_bush> Bribe, threaten, and cajole
[0:55:58] <@commanderclaw> Don't worry, a good DM could reign you in
[0:56:05] <%wolfofsound> @commanderclaw this
[0:56:07] <starotter70> Me and My friends just did a bunch of DUMB bullshit with out campaigns
[0:56:07] <Tennochief> The Dark Eldar COdex is a treat to read, Imperial and Chaos knights too
[0:56:09] <asurite_warrior> @AngriestPat in 3.5 thats weak shit
[0:56:13] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat yeah, you'd minmax a monk right up until you saw what's possible by minmaxing a BARD. That shit's fucken nuts.
[0:56:13] <DatAsuna> Dead money has great story too
[0:56:15] <12gagerager> Oh lord what kind of dm would you be?
[0:56:17] <otterboxer> A good DM would make you regret it lol
[0:56:19] <%ElenaManetta> Old World Blues is god-iter though
[0:56:21] <%GeneralSCPatton> Monks suck! They're only Tier 5!
[0:56:22] <+Yosepmeist> whats wrong with HH gameplay?
[0:56:22] <alrobot2014> i like the endings of dead money
[0:56:25] <%PauliusMaximus> old world blues is fantasitic though
[0:56:26] <%salty_syd913> barbarian is where number big go up
[0:56:28] <mankeyfigh> My ranged fighter build is AWESOME
[0:56:28] <FatherGreyBeard> Dead Money Hardcore is fun imo
[0:56:29] <+Punchasaur> Monk + air genasi = big broken
[0:56:31] <iusetheinternet> honest hearts had too hard of a shift in tone for my taste
[0:56:31] <pmtriox> dead money sucked to play though
[0:56:32] <%croxeye> what honest hearts and dead money are fantastic stories
[0:56:35] <@commanderclaw> I like Honest Hearts
[0:56:36] <%BlitzNeidhart> Dead Money is the only one I dislike the gameplay of
[0:56:37] <%salty_syd913> from the martial classes i thnk
[0:56:38] <%ElenaManetta> OWB is basically an entire expansion pack
[0:56:38] <%tinyswampthing> i play hearts for the guns and josuha
[0:56:41] <%meltdown547> Honest Heart's is the most bland content in all of New Vegas, and then it just ends with a pile of the loot, like it wasn't finished.
[0:56:42] <alrobot2014> old world blues and the penis feet will never leave me

[0:57:33] <Alphaetus_Prime> true
[0:57:33] <+yeeyeyee> i mean it's the main thrust of the game so not including it in the description would be weird
[0:57:34] <%TDotGoat> OMG

[0:57:35] <starotter70> FF7 is older than me

[0:58:07] <%augusm> sabibership
[0:58:09] <alrobot2014> wait really?
[0:58:09] <Tennochief> huh
[0:58:11] <DatAsuna> No
[0:58:12] <KaseKaizer> stripThink
[0:58:12] <%alcors_wisdom> oh yeah
[0:58:14] <alrobot2014> they existed out here?
[0:58:14] <DatAsuna> They were imported
[0:58:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> Sometimes you have to remember you are a hairless ape standing at the moist rocky bottom of a gravity well that is perpetually falling into a ongoing nuclear explosion
[0:58:15] <%ElenaManetta> missionary camels
[0:58:16] <%BlitzNeidhart> Sounds like bullshit but I believe it
[0:58:17] <%willjar313> Neat.
[0:58:19] <dekkitout> What happened?
[0:58:19] <%tweedler92> we have lions to
[0:58:19] <+Shaggnar> Iceage camels, they were like alpacas
[0:58:19] <%crimsonharvest> ancient camelids before the last ice age maybe?
[0:58:22] <%depressed_skeleton> theres camels in australia from WW2
[0:58:22] <$ZE_Count> yeah there was also lions and giant sloth.
[0:58:23] <%Gray_skies1993> huh, I actually didn't know that
[0:58:25] <DatAsuna> It's a thing called THE CAMEL CORPS
[0:58:27] <+Walopoh> Snapple Facts are known for being super wrong
[0:58:29] <+Yosepmeist> I heard that almost none of the Snapple facts are real
[0:58:31] <%fermentthegarbage> Do you?????
[0:58:36] <EuropantLamprey> Someone's pet camels probably got out and bred
[0:58:38] <%GohanEgret> I once won an NBA prize pack from a Snapple cap since it precisely predicted who would win the finals and in how many games
[0:58:39] <%kp539000> dunno what to say other than keep up the great work! :D
[0:58:42] <%senatorarmstrong_2020> hmm
[0:58:46] <%puhff> America used to have lions too
[0:58:46] <alrobot2014> @DatAsuna can you tell us more about THE CAMEL CORPS
[0:58:53] <+Punchasaur> Whales used to eat giant aquatic sloths
[0:58:53] <%BlitzNeidhart> @AngriestPat You've never had a job, how did you have a vacation?
[0:58:58] <DatAsuna> Basically camels got imported cause they carry way more shit way farther on less water than horses
[0:58:59] <canisdyluna> in space, no one can hear you cream..
[0:59:01] <Darkrenai> Pat in his SPACE CUBE
[0:59:04] <Alphaetus_Prime> it's not THAT hard
[0:59:05] <+barkon345> I once got a snapple cap that said 50% of the facts on snapple caps are false
[0:59:05] <Hawkbone_> Its not that hard
[0:59:07] <alrobot2014> ah thanks
[0:59:07] <%BioApple> no it's not just use the down camera
[0:59:07] <%Broand> here's the thing about landing
[0:59:09] <%Deadpal> There's a button to match speed
[0:59:11] <pmtriox> play lunar lander to practice
[0:59:12] <DatAsuna> and they don't need shoeing like horse for certain terrain either
[0:59:14] <%ElenaManetta> Landing was hard even back in Microsoft Flying Simulator
[0:59:14] <Alphaetus_Prime> landing cam makes it pretty simple
[0:59:14] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You're like Atton with that ship bro
[0:59:16] <%Broand> it's actually a lot more forgiving
[0:59:18] <%Yadogari> Just land 4Head
[0:59:18] <%kp539000> kp539000 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! dunno what else to say other than keep up the good work! :D
[0:59:20] <%Deadpal> and then you hit x to look down and then just land slowly
[0:59:21] <%ElenaManetta> Landing tech has never improved
[0:59:22] <%wolfofsound> because you don't use your landing camera!
[0:59:24] <%brave_sj> Landing's easy if you just remember to be good at video games
[0:59:26] <+Punchasaur> There was a crocodile with an armadillo shell too
[0:59:28] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat oh man you ain't seen NOTHIN yet. There's 2 things you should land on that'll have you sweating on the edge of your seat the entire time.
[0:59:29] <mybigmeech> Another happy landing
[0:59:30] <%bakiinthedemon> But Pat you just go up and down my dude
[0:59:36] <Smart_ZaK1> I'd like to see him play Kerbal Space Program

[1:16:41] <%wolfofsound> @BoomerTiro quantum, never in the same place twice and if you don't observe it it'll go away
[1:16:44] <$RubberFistFight> @BoomerTiro Quantum Moon. It's in a constant state of superposition and only locks into one location when it's being observed.
[1:16:47] <%depressed_skeleton> When are the common stumbo's getting their moon?
[1:16:55] <+geminitengu> :o wow pat has done alot!
[1:16:59] <+Griffin1171> quantum imaging
[1:17:00] <alcoholicstpmom> bramble is fun :)
[1:17:02] <%alcors_wisdom> take a picture it'll last longer
[1:17:05] <%GarbageQueenEllie> On the moon next to da hearth
[1:17:08] <%wolfofsound> @BoomerTiro well never in the same place twice during the current run
[1:17:09] <+Griffin1171> take a pic of quantum objects
[1:17:12] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you learned the rule of Quantum Imaging last time - taking a photo of something is the same as directly observing it.
[1:17:12] <danknugglit> Quantum furries
[1:17:15] <Louie_Salmon> @boomertiro Majora's Mask in space, that's the comparison he didn't want to make on the podcast
[1:17:16] <%Gray_skies1993> Pat is, if nothing else, thorough
[1:17:23] <dekkitout> In the quantum cupboard
[1:17:24] <%brave_sj> @Tennochief I think he wants to bring it back as a paid service, but I hope I'm just being pessimistic
[1:17:30] <hntronium> brittle hollow?
[1:17:31] <%alcors_wisdom> @danknugglit they both exist and dont exist at the same time
[1:17:33] <Pixel_gee> Feldspar is BEST boy
[1:17:33] <Alphaetus_Prime> over by the quantum shit
[1:17:36] <Smart_ZaK1> White hole station? O_o
[1:17:38] <%Broand> It's the quantum trials
[1:17:39] <sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat it's the tower of trials
[1:17:42] <%wujak> giants deep is where you went through the trial
[1:17:47] <+yeeyeyee> @AngriestPat btw i bought and finished this game after you streamed it, it's so good. Thanks!
[1:17:49] <+Griffin1171> gabbro is best frog
[1:17:50] <Tennochief> @brave_sj oh man I hope not
[1:17:55] <%alcors_wisdom> please sir do not fuck the quantum moon
[1:17:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> There's a thing on the nearby moon that observes Quantum Moon
[1:17:59] <%The_Esquana> yall ever seen any local 58 videos? spooky stuff
[1:17:59] <+yeeyeyee> definitely my favorite game released this summer
[1:18:02] <+Taglog7> pow rite in the kisser
[1:18:04] <$RubberFistFight> @Smart_ZaK1 there's a planet with an artificial black hole at its core, and it links to a white hole on the edge of the solar syste,/
[1:18:10] <Tersalus> pat has really been crushing the puzzles on this one...mostly due to crazed moon-lust
[1:18:13] <+Griffin1171> just look at earth and spin
[1:18:21] <dekkitout> Fly me to the Quantum Moon
[1:18:22] <+Griffin1171> until you see the moon
[1:18:26] <+geminitengu> maaaaan this sound track
[1:18:26] <+jcenderion> Spin to win Pat
[1:18:28] <$RubberFistFight> you fall into one, you fall out the other, only .001 seconds BEFORE you entered, which is cool.
[1:18:36] <Hawkbone_> The Ember Twin has some real interesting shit
[1:18:44] <$RubberFistFight> THERE IT IS
[1:18:44] <sileo_patronus> oh right he accidentaly launched the nomai ship last time right?
[1:18:45] <absolute_cagemony> Wow is this game just like a wet dream being had by Isaac Assimov, Arthur C Clarke, and Stephen Hawking all at the same time?
[1:18:48] <czeekyplays> I always mistake Timber Hearth for the QMoon
[1:18:54] <%roxikat> THE SUN, long a source of amusement
[1:18:55] <%Scottigecko> time to get comfy in space
[1:18:56] <%aishman> Man should I get this game on the PC or XBAWK?
[1:18:57] <%wolfofsound> I really want pat to go to bramble
[1:18:57] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat around brittle hollow
[1:18:59] <%aishman> It looks so chill
[1:19:00] <+Mr_Pylon> use your locator
[1:19:03] <+Taglog7> Where's Steve Bruel?
[1:19:03] <sileo_patronus> @czeekyplays fucking same
[1:19:05] <%Fidranth> @absolute_cagemony yes
[1:19:06] <%alcors_wisdom> the most bizarre part of this game for me is the complete lack of any fucks about atmosphere and relative pressure
[1:19:06] <+KozueMillz> use the map?
[1:19:07] <MassConnect> aww.. I missed an hour of stream. So... like 10 mins. of game?
[1:19:15] <absolute_cagemony> Awesome, I like that.
[1:19:16] <Tersalus> quantum travel seems way better than teleporter atom reassembly (aka death)
[1:19:16] <%brave_sj> @AngriestPat You can use your signalscope to look for quantum stuff
[1:19:17] <Alphaetus_Prime> @MassConnect like 1 minute of game
[1:19:18] <Hawkbone_> No
[1:19:19] <+theman515> is this the original fallout creator's game thing?
[1:19:20] <ssks123> no thats it
[1:19:21] <+yeeyeyee> what regular moon
[1:19:22] <%wolfofsound> LUL
[1:19:23] <Doodle_Taco> @massconnect Not even that
[1:19:24] <cham52> Is this the new pokemon snap
[1:19:25] <Tennochief> @MassConnect don't worry, you've missed nothing
[1:19:26] <Bearborg> that is it
[1:19:26] <$RubberFistFight> that's it dude
[1:19:27] <danknugglit> LUL
[1:19:28] <+yeeyeyee> brittle hollow doesn't have a moon
[1:19:29] <%dalmek> @angriestpat your signalscope can detect quantum objects like the moon
[1:19:29] <czeekyplays> @sileo_patronus stupid sexy atmosphere always gets me
[1:19:30] <Hawkbone_> @theman515 No
[1:19:32] <Tucker0603> THAT THE QUANT
[1:19:33] <+Griffin1171> there's not much more for you there tho
[1:19:33] <Louie_Salmon> If it has no name, it's the quantum moon
[1:19:37] <%CJett92> riiiiiiiiiiight into the sun now
[1:19:43] <%alcors_wisdom> remember you can listen for the quantum moon it has a frequency
[1:19:47] <%vaporousTippler> Shit, now I want to play Elite Dangerous.
[1:19:47] <Tennochief> come on
[1:19:49] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat well quantum frequencies
[1:19:50] <+KingGilbertIV> @theman515 you're thinking of outer worlds
[1:19:55] <Tennochief> stay on target for the sun
[1:19:57] <%This_is_Marco> ramming speeeed!
[1:19:58] <%arcaderabbit48> I have no idea whats going on
[1:20:00] <Tersalus> right to the sun!
[1:20:00] <Alphaetus_Prime> it doesn't really help but yeah
[1:20:03] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat now remember you can't use the landing camera, you have to fly it in manually
[1:20:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> @czeekyplays It's like I'm breathing nothing at all!
[1:20:08] <Louie_Salmon> If you've locked onto a quantum signal at some point, yeah

[1:22:04] <dekkitout> Aw man, I forgot about the Black Hole-Chan wave
[1:22:08] <+yeeyeyee> you can totally figure this out by accident
[1:22:09] <Louie_Salmon> @this_is_marco Not sure if you've seen the other stream of this, but that is a HILARIOUS question to ask on the quantum moon
[1:22:11] <+yeeyeyee> i did
[1:22:14] <BinaryBetrayer> He did the three places already?
[1:22:21] <Futurecity10> no
[1:22:23] <natebud> I think he has to revisit that wormhole planet
[1:22:23] <$ZE_Count> No just one
[1:22:24] <Timurine> chat dont
[1:22:25] <%CJett92> @BinaryBetrayer He's done 1
[1:22:27] <KaseKaizer> he's only completed one of the trials

[1:22:30] <%Reveresao> it didn't know chat didn't notice it
[1:22:31] <Hawkbone_> @BinaryBetrayer He only did the one on Giants Deep
[1:22:32] <$RubberFistFight> @Alphaetus_Prime no, i think he has yet to visit the twins. He's been to Giant's deep (not the core), went to Brittle Hollow for a bit, Attlerock, and... that's about it, I think.
[1:22:33] <%foreverN2dust> No spoils chat
[1:22:34] <Futurecity10> He hasnt explored the oceans, Brittle hollow
[1:22:37] <%crimsonharvest> thats the black hole inside the cracked planet but i seem to remember it falling apart as time wears on

[1:23:21] <+jcenderion> @AngriestPat You can see the bones through the suit
[1:23:22] <$RubberFistFight> @Futurecity10 he did the oceans mostly, on the last stream, and he visited the Hollow briefly because he got terrified falling into the hole.

[1:24:05] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat protip: the rule of quantum imaging applies on the moon also.
[1:24:07] <Alphaetus_Prime> there's a certain deduction you can make here
[1:24:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> Don't blink in the quantum ship
[1:24:12] <%brave_sj> How nuts would it be if YOUR ship became quantum on the moon
[1:24:12] <%Gogogolem> quantum sharks?
[1:24:16] <dekkitout> Quantum Moon, where aimlessly wandering is the best option!
[1:24:19] <+jcenderion> You have the frequency for finding them
[1:24:20] <%Gogogolem> terrifying
[1:24:21] <+Griffin1171> just look for quantum fluctuations
[1:24:22] <Smart_ZaK1> He's gonna go wormholing again
[1:24:24] <Alphaetus_Prime> @brave_sj it does lol
[1:24:28] <Louie_Salmon> @brave_sj It actually did
[1:24:29] <%alcors_wisdom> well to be exact for something to exist in a quantum state it has to exist in 2 states at the same time
[1:24:30] <$RubberFistFight> @Futurecity10 oh, yeah. Well there's something he has to do while the tornados are still on too, iirc.
[1:24:33] <$ZE_Count> Its launches the cannon
[1:24:34] <+Taglog7> thx gdq
[1:24:35] <%alcors_wisdom> left takes you to the mmon

[1:24:41] <%crimsonharvest> maybe the destination has been destroyed
[1:24:42] <%dalmek> @angriestpat again, use the signalscope's 'quantum fluctuations' channel to find shards
[1:24:49] <Bearborg> left is park i think
[1:25:01] <laguerrilha> isnt it just a turn left/go forward/turn right control?
[1:25:08] <sileo_patronus> Left launches, middle warps back to the cannon, right stops in place
[1:25:12] <natebud> My guess is that left is like hitting down on a elevator when you're on the first floor.
[1:25:20] <+yeeyeyee> @laguerrilha no
[1:25:24] <%crimsonharvest> maybe the teleport tower needs configuring somehow

[1:35:30] <Pepebotellaw> 420
[1:35:33] <+yeeyeyee> you have to actually go to the white hole station to relearn
[1:35:34] <dekkitout> It's line of sight fast travel, no?
[1:35:35] <Louie_Salmon> It was at the end of 5 hours of BIG learning
[1:35:35] <%Reveresao> what is right in front of you
[1:35:35] <$RubberFistFight> @Dementedpenguin yep, constructed by the Nomai though
[1:35:36] <$ZE_Count> go there first befor epiece of brittle hollow get there
[1:35:37] <+geminitengu> lmao its alright just ahve fun
[1:35:37] <MyNameIsRasus> it was in front of you when you warped
[1:35:38] <natebud> I don't think you really explored it last time.
[1:35:40] <Pixel_gee> Theres notes about it on your computer
[1:35:40] <PKLoveLucas> it's right in front of you as you exit the white hole
[1:35:40] <+nawji> pat I cant tell you anything wothout consent
[1:35:40] <+yeeyeyee> fuck off you couldn't see
[1:35:41] <+AWr00tBear> Stop looking at the white hole and got to the station it was the first thing you see... never mind
[1:35:42] <sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat important note that the white hole station was DIRECTLY in front of you when you warped
[1:35:42] <+jcenderion> @AngriestPat Whenever you fall through the hole the station should be straight ahead, so just dont panic
[1:35:43] <Monkeyweed21> read ship log stumbo
[1:35:44] <Alphaetus_Prime> can I just say I love how the wakeup noise changes if you died by suffocation
[1:35:49] <MachoMadnesss94> its directly in front of you when you go through the black hole
[1:35:50] <%brave_sj> @AngriestPat It points you at the station when you come out of the black hole
[1:35:50] <masterfire23> that looked like a piece of the planet fell into the black hole
[1:35:51] <PKLoveLucas> literally silouetted against the sun
[1:35:52] <Hawkbone_> @KaseKaizer Your ship stays in orbit when the moon teleports, so it was still around Brittle Hollow
[1:35:58] <%arcaderabbit48> So why are we immortal?
[1:35:58] <%Reveresao> when you got teleported
[1:36:01] <+asgard147> try a different planet, might find something to help? limesThink
[1:36:06] <Dementedpenguin> @RubberFistFight actually my stream hiccuped at a black screen, so.... >_>
[1:36:07] <+yeeyeyee> the game is designed so you can't NOT see the white hole station
[1:36:09] <+Griffin1171> that was cool, the quantum moon appeeared and disappeared when you blinked
[1:36:11] <$joylent_blue> Alphaetus_Prime right? i noticed that before, its the little details monkaS
[1:36:11] <$ZE_Count> just dont turn pat
[1:36:16] <Hawkbone_> @arcaderabbit48 Play the game or watch the first stream.
[1:36:22] <Smart_ZaK1> Go to white hole without jumping through brittle hollow
[1:36:26] <Dementedpenguin> @RubberFistFight But I'll take your word for it!
[1:36:30] <Tersalus> @arcaderabbit48 not immortal, sending memories back in time on each death
[1:36:32] <MyNameIsRasus> @arcaderabbit48 kinda spoilers, just know that a statue looked at you weird
[1:36:34] <$RubberFistFight> One problem with this game is it can be a real muddle to figure out, and doing it infront of almost 1200 people just makes that worse.
[1:36:43] <$RubberFistFight> there so fucking much to remember
[1:36:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> go to briddle hollow
[1:36:46] <%Reveresao> you can just go to the planet
[1:36:47] <Monkeyweed21> NO YOU DONT
[1:36:48] <%wujak> you can go straight to brittle hollow
[1:36:51] <+Griffin1171> don't bother with the moon
[1:36:51] <hntronium> Just go to brittle hollow
[1:36:52] <MartyFun11> Why not just fly to brittle hollow??
[1:36:52] <ssks123> you could just go to brittle hollow
[1:36:52] <corepool> you can just go there
[1:36:53] <Alphaetus_Prime> OH NO NotLikeThis
[1:36:55] <%Broand> What are you thinking
[1:36:55] <+nawji> Pat you generally want a gameplan for each life. Pick a planet and check it out.
[1:36:56] <Louie_Salmon> Well you could also just go to the planet
[1:36:56] <PKLoveLucas> pat, just go straight to brittle hollow
[1:36:56] <Moonlight_Grimoire> just go to brittle hollow??
[1:36:56] <$ZE_Count> just fly to brittle hollow dumb dumb
[1:36:56] <glaciusinfinite> no you don't
[1:36:57] <MyNameIsRasus> just go to the planet
[1:36:58] <CatmanIX> why would you go to the moon again?
[1:36:59] <+asgard147> why? limesThink
[1:37:01] <LodiFrostbeard> @AngriestPat why not just fly to brittle hollow
[1:37:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> Just go there
[1:37:02] <Smart_ZaK1> Don't bother
[1:37:02] <+Griffin1171> just go to a different planet
[1:37:04] <%GarbageQueenEllie> yeye
[1:37:04] <%crimsonharvest> you dont need to go to the moon try your SPACE SHIP to fly to planets

[1:37:17] <MachoMadnesss94> thas how space work
[1:37:19] <+Mr_Pylon> you can just go to Brittle Hollow
[1:37:19] <+yeeyeyee> you're very smart pat
[1:37:26] <BinaryBetrayer> Galaxy brain.
[1:37:28] <%GarbageQueenEllie> And if you have your ship handy, you'll be less likely to die again
[1:37:29] <+Griffin1171> don't limit yourself to just trying to beat the game
[1:37:31] <%crimsonharvest> is there anything to do on the lava ball
[1:37:33] <Smart_ZaK1> Coming in hot
[1:37:35] <$ZE_Count> explore the surface pat before it falls into the black hole.
[1:37:35] <MachoMadnesss94> roads? we won't need roads where we
[1:37:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> Thas how night work
[1:37:38] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat just remember for later that the version of the moon that orbits Brittle Hollow allows you to go ALMOST to the north pole. I won't say why that's important because spoilers, but you will want to recall that fact when the time comes.
[1:37:41] <+yeeyeyee> @crimsonharvest no, you can't even land on it
[1:37:46] <%wolfofsound> coming in hot LUL
[1:37:48] <%crimsonharvest> nailed it

[1:38:05] <Ner234> monkaS
[1:38:05] <+Griffin1171> there's stuff on hollow lantern
[1:38:13] <osiris1260> You can in fact land on the lava planet
[1:38:16] <zedravan> this seems safe LUL
[1:38:17] <%brave_sj> @crimsonharvest @yeeyeyee There's totally stuff on the lava ball
[1:38:23] <PKLoveLucas> you haven't landed anywhere, because you've NEVER flown to brittle hollow
[1:38:25] <Tersalus> quantum trees??
[1:38:25] <$RubberFistFight> @Alphaetus_Prime watching him figure out how to get inside this tower should be fun Kappa
[1:38:35] <+yeeyeyee> @brave_sj it doesn't even have an entry on the map, so i doubt it
[1:38:44] <+Griffin1171> check for quantum fluctuations
[1:38:45] <$RubberFistFight> @PKLoveLucas he came here last stream
[1:38:45] <Alphaetus_Prime> @yeeyeyee it does if you find the thing on it
[1:38:55] <Alphaetus_Prime> @yeeyeyee there's no clues leading to it AFAIK
[1:38:55] <osiris1260> In the volcano

[1:38:56] <Pepebotellaw> buckle up buckaroo!
[1:39:00] <%crimsonharvest> signal nearby hmmm
[1:39:00] <MachoMadnesss94> misse dit
[1:39:01] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat bring your signalscope up.
[1:39:13] <%This_is_Marco> monkaS
[1:39:13] <%brave_sj> @yeeyeyee Hollow's Lantern absolutely has an entry. I found it in my game
[1:39:15] <+ThatButler> This game just did the most important thing, it understood the difference between a hypothesis and a theory!
[1:39:17] <PKLoveLucas> @RubberFistFight he's only ever come here via solanum's ship, he's never approached it from space
[1:39:19] <dekkitout> If a quantum tree falls in the woods, did it even fall?
[1:39:19] <MachoMadnesss94> he found it yay
[1:39:22] <+yeeyeyee> @Alphaetus_Prime damn then i missed that, crazy
[1:39:28] <%Broand> pffft

[1:39:38] <Tersalus> @dekkitout yes, three counties over
[1:39:47] <Alphaetus_Prime> @yeeyeyee I only found it because I looked up if I had missed anything after beating the game tbh
[1:39:55] <$RubberFistFight> @PKLoveLucas really? I coulda sworn he landed here and then fell through the hole right at the end of the last stream. Oh well, either way.
[1:40:01] <glaciusinfinite> pat use signalscope to find quantum objects
[1:40:24] <+Onlysamfisher > did stream just start?
[1:40:29] <$RubberFistFight> @dekkitout well it would be equal parts fallen and not-fallen, wouldn't it. Superposition and all that.

[1:46:35] <dekkitout> "Look up, stupid. 4Head "
[1:46:37] <+Mr_Pylon> Next time try slingshotting the black hole
[1:46:40] <Alphaetus_Prime> see there's the thing

[1:48:57] <Tersalus> @youwereeatenbyalid he fell through the same black hole 3 times, repeated the same areas, and is just now picking up where he left of
[1:49:03] <%brave_sj> @Naoyin It's the warping effects, the same ones they use on the White Hole. Fucks me up too
[1:49:22] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @Tersalus fucking awesome. @angriespat thanks for being bad at videogames!
[1:49:23] <%alcors_wisdom> man if only you had a camera you could shove down that hole to see what was down there
[1:49:30] <$RubberFistFight> @Naoyin me too, it's apparently very common with this game.
[1:49:41] <%crimsonharvest> TFW you accidentally violate causality, annihilating your own existence
[1:49:46] <$RubberFistFight> the black hole is cool as shit but holy fuck does it make me anxious
[1:49:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> Throw your camera down the hole!

[1:52:51] <sileo_patronus> @Fidranth momentum, inertia is tendency to stay at rest
[1:52:53] <%Broand> has pat survived more than like 20 minutes?
[1:52:53] <Naoyin> the mystery of how many times pat can die

[1:53:03] <BappoSama> By tearing apart, you mean putting back together.. @AngriestPat
[1:53:04] <Prism_Wing> You're a real mystery machine, you are.
[1:53:07] <%Fidranth> @sileo_patronus (I know(
[1:53:08] <Pixel_gee> An incredibly well constructed mystery, too.
[1:53:10] <MyNameIsRasus> pat you can match velocity while out of the ship
[1:53:12] <laguerrilha> slow down your speed when landing, it will probably lessen the impact dmg
[1:53:16] <+KenSmi> Whats the mystery?
[1:53:17] <Alphaetus_Prime> @sileo_patronus inertia is the tendency for your momentum to not change so it's correct
[1:53:23] <Alphaetus_Prime> @sileo_patronus kinda
[1:53:28] <MassConnect> have we broken the prime directive yet?
[1:53:34] <Hawkbone_> @Broand The sun only explodedlike 2 or 3 times for him. Every other death has been hi, somehow killing himself

[1:58:47] <absolute_cagemony> IATI!
[1:58:51] <Ner234> Quantum everywhere system
[1:58:53] <mankeyfigh> there's a cave
[1:58:53] <MyNameIsRasus> it's just dopw
[1:58:54] <BinaryBetrayer> Everything is quantum. That's a lesson right there.
[1:58:54] <%brave_sj> I wonder if there's actually a puzzle here or if it's just "look at this nutty quantum shit"
[1:59:00] <MachoMadnesss94> LUL
[1:59:04] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @Ner234 quantum nowhere system
[1:59:07] <natebud> The poetry is fighting back
[1:59:09] <mankeyfigh> follow the river
[1:59:10] <absolute_cagemony> It means Tifa.
[1:59:12] <%brave_sj> Never park in a quantum zone
[1:59:16] <%GarbageQueenEllie> What if the UNIVERSE is quantum?
[1:59:17] <%TaifuDragon> I think this one is just weird
[1:59:17] <$ZE_Count> its fine
[1:59:23] <danknugglit> Quantum means EXTREME
[1:59:24] <%Dr_DangerPhD> quantum T.S. Eliot dropping verses
[1:59:25] <LodiFrostbeard> @QuadraticGravity wait theres something there? i finished the game and i still don't know what the quantum grove is about
[1:59:26] <BinaryBetrayer> Quantum damage.
[1:59:28] <CatmanIX> wasn't the ship in the water?
[1:59:29] <MachoMadnesss94> I don't know what the poem is actually for, never figured that out
[1:59:34] <%QuadraticGravity> @LodiFrostbeard noclue
[1:59:41] <absolute_cagemony> What if my dick is quantam, you don't even know how big it might be gurl!
[1:59:42] <Louie_Salmon> @brave_sj I mean, the whole game is just excuses to look at cool quantum shit anyway
[1:59:45] <%crimsonharvest> Space is big / space is dark / its hard to find / a place to park
[1:59:48] <BinaryBetrayer> I think the grove is just to teach the extent of quantum shenanigans.
[1:59:48] <MyNameIsRasus> he really could use entaglement
[1:59:48] <shadytreeofknowledge> sup Pat i started streaming n am trying to be a cop got a test coming up
[1:59:52] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:59:54] <%QuadraticGravity> It is open??
[1:59:55] <Alphaetus_Prime> I mean not ALL the cool shit in the game is quantum
[1:59:55] <Quantumsheep1> So far as I could tell it's just nutty quantum shit that's meant to give you another chance to learn the rules
[2:00:04] <%MattDemers> MattDemers subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Keep it going, Pat. Thanks for everything!

[2:00:43] <laguerrilha> Pat is using quantum speech, its both wrong and right
[2:00:47] <Tersalus> *did in the game
[2:00:53] <absolute_cagemony> But if you look in a vagina then it turns into a Xenomorph hive cause you're observing it
[2:01:04] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @thunderborn32 yeah, it's cool though, and basically a science fiction convention at this point

[2:08:38] <%Frost_Quill> I still don't understand how the launch thing works. How the fuck is it shooting in random directions every time? If you're sending your memories back in time why would that change which number the ship's computer decided for the random generation?
[2:08:40] <bashful_bard> Those cyclnes are horrifying
[2:08:44] <%brave_sj> SourPls

[2:10:42] <Hawkbone_> Technically you could always do that by jumping from a high place. Or going into space without a suit
[2:10:43] <dekkitout> Just pull an Ajin and off yourself for a cheap reset
[2:10:43] <%ColonelRozum> @BappoSama meditate till the next loop is what he did
[2:10:49] <natebud> You learned Lay Down And Die

[2:13:43] <%juxtest> Just slam a spaceship into these ancient ruins
[2:13:54] <MachoMadnesss94> @AngriestPat landing mode can be useful for exploring a planets surface. lets you fly around easily while looking at the ground
[2:13:59] <Alphaetus_Prime> nice landing LUL
[2:14:01] <%XeroSigmaPrime> XeroSigmaPrime subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! If you blew my mind with this game but you didnt know you blew my mind, did you actually blow my mind?
[2:14:01] <$joylent_blue> that landing LUL
[2:14:02] <Delenay> there was a cave near the edge of this snow
[2:14:08] <SixthSun2> Nice landing 4Head

[2:14:48] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> You're forgetting Ember Twin i think?
[2:14:48] <MachoMadnesss94> @BioApple he found new ways to die
[2:14:49] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @osiris1260 I think so? think it was an osirus anyway
[2:14:49] <$joylent_blue> don't spoiler the [spoiler] guys
[2:14:52] <%BioApple> sick
[2:14:53] <$joylent_blue> LUL
[2:14:53] <silverira> hey @AngriestPat have you checked out the comet?
[2:14:56] <+yeeyeyee> this game is literally ONLY gated by you the player knowing things, so spoiling pieces of info is like actively deleting parts of this game for pat. please don't do that.
[2:14:56] <Louie_Salmon> @bioapple Big stumbo
[2:14:58] <Alphaetus_Prime> I think you found that last time
[2:15:06] <$ZE_Count> perfect landing
[2:15:20] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah could have phrased that better
[2:15:20] <Alphaetus_Prime> like last stream I mean
[2:15:25] <osiris1260> @youwereeatenbyalid I don’t think it was me, this is my first stream of Pats
[2:15:25] <sileo_patronus> I died here once
[2:15:31] <Hawkbone_> The phantom moon? Woah HOOOOOOOO
[2:15:35] <eco419> Pat loves spoiler Kappa
[2:15:41] <$RubberFistFight> @yeeyeyee to counter that, unless he's paying strict attention to certain things that don't indicate strict attention should be paid, he can wind up running in circles for literally hours in confusion.
[2:15:47] <dekkitout> Playful Moon and Hollow Lantern sound like great finisher names
[2:15:49] <Alphaetus_Prime> yeah you definitely found this last stream
[2:15:54] <Alphaetus_Prime> but eh it's fine
[2:15:56] <%brave_sj> 1
[2:15:58] <Ner234> 1
[2:15:59] <%brave_sj> 2

[2:16:22] <$ZE_Count> Shooting ropes of pee
[2:16:28] <+CaptainJax> the pee is so loud
[2:16:30] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I can't count
[2:16:33] <+Griffin1171> new sub animation looks like DSP

[2:16:40] <$RubberFistFight> @ZE_Count WutFace
[2:16:41] <%GarbageNirvana> @rubberfistfight I'd argue if he asks for help then help him, otherwise let him go at his own pace. You can always wait for the vod and skip ahead
[2:16:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> What comes after 1?
[2:16:44] <MyNameIsRasus> good thing pat has his MAGNUM DONG to shoot pee faster
[2:16:48] <eco419> remember when he missed that upgrade on hollow knight and wasted 6 hours i member
[2:16:50] <Frostydough> ou will never reach the two second mark
[2:17:09] <MachoMadnesss94> @osiris1260 talking to Gabbro
[2:17:10] <aimlesshealer> Wide urethra
[2:17:17] <$RubberFistFight> @GarbageNirvana that's a very fair point. I've been trying to keep my mouth shut, at any rate. I wanted to see him play this at his own pace, so I need to behave LUL

[2:17:51] <%GeneralSCPatton> @tennochief Infinite pants-shitting in the dropped packets

[2:18:06] <eco419> LUL
[2:18:09] <Endocrom> 2 hours eh? what did I miss?

[2:18:34] <MyNameIsRasus> but is the frustration getting bigger
[2:18:42] <MachoMadnesss94> @Endocrom just some stumbo
[2:18:48] <%Onlysamfisher > Onlysamfisher  subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! hey 5 months! thanks for the great content pat! question when is the next Baba is you stream, and do you watch Legion?
[2:18:48] <glaciusinfinite> @endocrom big stumbos
[2:18:49] <%GarbageNirvana> I watched Paige's Baba streams live, this is nothing
[2:18:50] <osiris1260> The problem I’ve always had with Twitch spoilers is that I’m never sure if it’s okay to point something out that they’ve missed/ said they checked but where wrong, like, he checked the place and went “yep, nothing here” is that okay to correct?
[2:18:53] <$HyperionXV> Pat fell in the black hole like 5 times
[2:18:59] <aimlesshealer> Damn, I missed it
[2:19:14] <Tennochief> and crashed into the sun with autopilot on
[2:19:18] <+Griffin1171> Diavalo could probably escape that infinite loop if he wasn't so jumpy
[2:19:20] <+yeeyeyee> honestly aggressively temp-banning people who spoiler would be the best outcome but that isn't paypig-friendly sbfpSetIn
[2:19:30] <MassConnect> which character in this game has the least honor? i.e. no honor?
[2:19:34] <eco419> if he says chat help thats the obvious sign to spoil LUL
[2:19:35] <%GarbageNirvana> For this game in particular I'd say let him figure it out
[2:19:45] <%Broand> I'm gonna actually do some playin while listening
[2:19:51] <corepool> damn this IS a big pee
[2:19:51] <Tennochief> Gabro
[2:19:59] <thunderborn32> @osiris1260 sometimes i feel it isn't accidental i mean after dozens and dozens of times you think he would do more then a 4 second glance at a room before walking away
[2:20:03] <$joylent_blue> the biggest of pees
[2:20:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> @griffin1171 How? All his inputs are lost with the dropped packets.
[2:20:06] <Rotanimood> number one became number two for sure
[2:20:08] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @MassConnect Gravity
[2:20:13] <%GarbageNirvana> It's on roughly 20-minute loops so it's not like he's majorly screwing himself if he misses something
[2:20:16] <%BioApple> @osiris1260 the game itself tells you when you've missed stuff
[2:20:18] <glaciusinfinite> Pat will figure it out episode1
[2:20:18] <dekkitout> Come to think of it, The Boruto's Dad series has a Sharingan ability that's GER, but with more steps
[2:20:19] <MyNameIsRasus> @osiris1260 i mean considering that thing specifically is something he isnt supposed to find out now it's fine to let him think he's done with the area
[2:20:23] <$ZE_Count> 22 mins if I remember right
[2:20:28] <eco419> just Honk
[2:20:34] <+yeeyeyee> you have infinite time to do anything in this game because if you fuck up you just start over
[2:20:45] <laguerrilha> normally wait for the streamer to ask for help
[2:20:49] <+yeeyeyee> the time limit is more like a schedule
[2:21:00] <eco419> OpieOP
[2:21:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> got food. now here. whu happon
[2:21:09] <MyNameIsRasus> if he asks for helo then help seems fine
[2:21:14] <thunderborn32> thats it! if he misses something we should do him like he treats page and spam HONK
[2:21:15] <laguerrilha> if they are going from a point of no return either ask the mods to tell, or be not as direct
[2:21:18] <%brave_sj> Oh no Pat fell in
[2:21:29] <MyNameIsRasus> i'm in for the HONK plan
[2:21:30] <glaciusinfinite> the Galaxy has to go to the bathroom every 22 min
[2:21:32] <osiris1260> The problem is, what if they are sure, but they’re wrong. Is it acceptable if they don’t know they need help
[2:21:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> @thunderborn32 That could be fun
[2:21:33] <MachoMadnesss94> or if its something miss-able and they are about to lock themselves out of finding it just "nudge" them, don't flat out spoil it
[2:21:36] <Endocrom> Get the rope ladder!
[2:21:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> butt piss
[2:21:48] <MassConnect> the song looped. guess that means we died.
[2:21:48] <%BioApple> third for HONK
[2:21:54] <eco419> honk is tehe best way to let him know and shit on him
[2:21:55] <+yeeyeyee> you can't lock yourself out of finding anything in this game though
[2:21:55] <%brave_sj> He's embarking on a whimsical journey through Montreal's sewers to get back home
[2:21:56] <+KoyaMusa> pat's dumping a whole lot of piss now isn't he
[2:22:02] <$joylent_blue> are we seriously debating the ethics of backseating
[2:22:05] <$joylent_blue> just don't do it
[2:22:07] <$joylent_blue> dummies
[2:22:10] <$RubberFistFight> is the video repeatedly breaking for anyone else?
[2:22:18] <glaciusinfinite> no
[2:22:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the whole bucket gets dumped
[2:22:21] <Tennochief> turn off twitch auto quality
[2:22:21] <eco419> no
[2:22:23] <MachoMadnesss94> but don't HONK at thinks he's not supposed to find yet if he will end up finding them later
[2:22:32] <+yeeyeyee> if you want someone to play the game right, play it yourself tbh
[2:22:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Not to mention a game like this is all about the journey
[2:22:36] <Rotanimood> Draining all the fluids for purity
[2:22:39] <%CJett92> Did Pat fall in?
[2:22:40] <+king_egret_sly> did pat fall into the quantum shitter
[2:22:40] <MyNameIsRasus> yeah HONK only when appropriate
[2:22:55] <glaciusinfinite> @cjett92 of course
[2:22:59] <$RubberFistFight> @Tennochief I've done that. Doesn't stop it trying to change itself anyway. Because twitch knows better, apparently.
[2:23:04] <eco419> if you dont want to engage on chat minimize us

[2:23:23] <+yeeyeyee> you can't not engage with chat because pat engages with chat because he's a streamer
[2:23:24] <MachoMadnesss94> but I agree that 99% of the time just don't say anything
[2:23:31] <glaciusinfinite> pat a small man wit beeg brain
[2:23:35] <corepool> pat stared into the pee and the pee stared back
[2:23:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pat is in a superposition of doing Number 1, Number 2, and procrasturbating, until observed.
[2:23:39] <laguerrilha> Pat is probably cutting the monkey tail (poop)

[2:23:50] <%GarbageNirvana> Also you could be spoiling it for people in chat to are on this journey with him so think about that

[2:23:57] <laguerrilha> quantum pee
[2:23:59] <%GarbageNirvana> *who are
[2:24:06] <thunderborn32> @yeeyeyee that kind of thinking is in the same line of how developers feel their sales numbers are lower because of streamers, when in actually if someone wasn't streaming it we just wouldn't buy it anyway. no matter what reasoning you try to give if someone isn't going to buy it their not going to buy it
[2:24:07] <+yeeyeyee> i've already beaten the game you peanut brain, we're talking about pat @eco419
[2:24:15] <$RubberFistFight> @MachoMadnesss94 I think he should keep a notebook of places he's visited/things he's done, in shorthand, just so he doesn't wind up repeating steps there's no need to. Time loops, but things you learned stay learned.
[2:24:16] <masterfire23> shrodingers Pat
[2:24:21] <$joylent_blue> yeah what @GarbageNirvana said

[2:25:06] <MachoMadnesss94> @RubberFistFight well to be fair the game does that for you and tells you if there are places that have things that you missed, he just needs to check it more
[2:25:06] <Heyestus> @AngriestPat are you really sorry tho?
[2:25:06] <+Dragon_Bilbo> lol

[2:25:34] <$RubberFistFight> @thunderborn32 streamers are a fantastic method of exposure for lesser-known titles. A lot of games fly under a lot of peoples' radars because they're unaware they contain themes the players love. I had no idea this had anything to do with time loops and black holes and quantum physics and shit until I saw pat playing - immediately snapped it up myself.
[2:25:41] <Alphaetus_Prime> @AngriestPat you can mark it on your hud in the ship's log
[2:25:43] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat Did you drop the toilet paper roll into the toilet again?
[2:25:45] <%dalmek> now YOU'RE the Pee Pee Poo Poo man
[2:25:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> @thunderborn32 Pat makes me want to buy this, but I refuse to use EGS. The company is infinitely more to blame for bad sales than streamers are.

[2:36:29] <Alphaetus_Prime> @RubberFistFight he hasn't actually figured it out yet

[2:36:46] <MachoMadnesss94> ah yes the cowards way, the only true way
[2:36:47] <Gorshum> This game looks super cool, surprised I'd never heard of it.
[2:36:55] <Smart_ZaK1> Palnet is like the internet for friends
[2:36:57] <glaciusinfinite> Yeah "meditating"
[2:37:00] <Alphaetus_Prime> It's an epic exclusive so
[2:37:01] <@lewdskeletor13> There is an eventual ending tot this game, yeah?
[2:37:02] <Quantumsheep1> Death
[2:37:02] <$RubberFistFight> @Gorshum a lot of people passed over it because of Epic store stank
[2:37:02] <Hawkbone_> Brittle Hollow is one of the coolest planets
[2:37:09] <%crimsonharvest> cant you fly the ship inside the crust of the hollow or does the black hole fuck it up cause the contorl is a bit coarse for real 6DOF movement
[2:37:13] <Gorshum> Oooh
[2:37:14] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Perfect
[2:37:14] <Alphaetus_Prime> @lewdskeletor13 oh boy is there

[2:37:22] <MyNameIsRasus> @lewdskeletor13 yes and it's super dope
[2:37:23] <MachoMadnesss94> @Gorshum Lots of people didn't, I didn't know what it was until pat started playing it
[2:37:26] <eco419> NAILED IT
[2:37:29] <Marpolo13> you did nail the planet yes
[2:37:32] <%Nymphonomicon> apatSkelmoney apatElmo
[2:37:33] <Hawkbone_> @lewdskeletor13 Yes, and if Pat knew how to do the thing, he could do it without ever having to go through a loop.
[2:37:34] <Tennochief> so graceful
[2:37:34] <+Parrish_broadnax> Pat lands how I park
[2:37:37] <$joylent_blue> continuing to nail it
[2:37:38] <+Griffin1171> what's the plan?
[2:37:38] <sileo_patronus> can the ship break parts off the planet
[2:37:39] <majindusto> FIRST TRY
[2:37:44] <%demegodz> Wow he couldn't have landed that worse
[2:37:44] <danknugglit> Do fast yea
[2:37:45] <KingVantq> Alot of people got it free on xbox from E3 last year
[2:37:48] <Quantumsheep1> @crimsonharvest It's doable but tricky
[2:37:51] <EuropantLamprey> Pat, stop slamming into everything at sonic speeds
[2:37:57] <GrindandGripe> Is that wall a setpiece or does Pat live in a castle now?
[2:37:57] <danknugglit> Quick fast go yea
[2:37:59] <Alphaetus_Prime> I love how everything on the ship breaks individually
[2:37:59] <@lewdskeletor13> BLUE STREAK
[2:38:04] <@lewdskeletor13> SPEED BY
[2:38:06] <eco419> is on xbox game pass free
[2:38:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> He could've exploded, I'd say that's worse
[2:38:13] <BinaryBetrayer> Did he get into the tower?
[2:38:14] <%crimsonharvest> the speed of sound is only 343m/s
[2:38:16] <hntronium> Can you pilot the ship into the black hole?
[2:38:20] <+Griffin1171> you can target specific locations in the ship log
[2:38:26] <Hawkbone_> @hntronium Yes
[2:38:30] <scomm29> how many minutes till sun blow up?
[2:38:32] <%Gray_skies1993> nice landing!
[2:38:40] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @scomm29 a while. 20 probably
[2:38:42] <%crimsonharvest> theres camp smoke there
[2:38:42] <eco419> spelunker time
[2:38:43] <%BioApple> @scomm29 he just relooped so like 20?

[2:39:02] <mankeyfigh> INTresting
[2:39:13] <$RubberFistFight> campfight
[2:39:20] <scomm29> so the point of the game is to reset and stop the sun from blow up yeah?

[2:39:45] <%puhff> what is ghost matter?
[2:39:48] <majindusto> GHOSTS
[2:39:52] <%puhff> besides deadly
[2:39:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ghost pirates
[2:39:57] <KingVantq> @eco419 had to watch the 2018 Xbox E3 on mixer LUL
[2:39:57] <$ZE_Count> read it
[2:39:58] <%crimsonharvest> is ghost matter a displaced spacetime pocket and crossing it tears your apart or what
[2:39:59] <%Mtome> Ghost odor
[2:39:59] <ssks123> the building with trees pat
[2:39:59] <%XeroSigmaPrime> KILL EM WITH GUN
[2:39:59] <$RubberFistFight> @puhff pretty sure it's this game's take on dark matter
[2:40:03] <Smart_ZaK1> Just boost up
[2:40:07] <hntronium> Ghost Matter Pirates
[2:40:10] <$joylent_blue> i can confidently say that thats some ghost shit right there
[2:40:13] <Alphaetus_Prime> @GarbageQueenEllie there's a good reason
[2:40:14] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @RubberFistFight seems more like really fast radiation poisoning to me
[2:40:17] <+Griffin1171> get a vantage points
[2:40:18] <%crimsonharvest> "building with trees growing from it" the note said
[2:40:21] <danknugglit> Ghost matter = space cooties
[2:40:21] <%CJett92> So I guessing Ghost matter is gonna be a Thing, ya?
[2:40:26] <sileo_patronus> if only he took in information as he read it
[2:40:30] <eco419> @kingvantq LUL ooooh that explains a lot
[2:40:33] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Alphaetus_Prime Ah, a clue! Gotta show my dog

[2:51:13] <%demegodz> Suns getting real RED
[2:51:16] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @commanderclaw think its about time to get poeple to shut the fuck up
[2:51:16] <eco419> Chat angery LUL
[2:51:20] <%Fidranth> to be fair the soultion is pretty hard to come to on your own (I didn't)
[2:51:24] <Alphaetus_Prime> MODS GET IN HERE
[2:51:25] <+jcenderion> It was a simple hint to be honest
[2:51:26] <+Griffin1171> suns getting real low
[2:51:27] <sileo_patronus> Welcome to Twitch Plays Outer Wilds
[2:51:27] <%Frost_Quill> The way that was worded made me think the guy was guessing.
[2:51:30] <%AncelDeLambert> alright, people, chill
[2:51:34] <NigelWMurphy> I'm fine with this spoil, only because the game never gives you a hint of what to do
[2:51:35] <+Sestren413> all emoji all the time limesCop
[2:51:35] <natebud> Some guy guessed what to do and chat ain't having it.
[2:51:36] <%TaifuDragon> nah fuck that guy
[2:51:37] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat ain't angry, so chill
[2:51:39] <Tennochief> I don't think the guy did much wrong
[2:51:40] <Alphaetus_Prime> it doesn't MATTER if the guy was guessing
[2:51:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> Well, fuck you, angelhero07
[2:51:41] <$839ricky> you missed some text
[2:51:42] <+timblenaut> chat spoiling shit is going to make pat turn the game off
[2:51:45] <%GarbageQueenEllie> If only you were spoderman
[2:51:46] <Broooomy> dude the primary gameplay loop of this game is finding out how to do shit, spoilers literally removes gamplay for this game
[2:51:46] <@commanderclaw> If Pat appreciates the advice, then I'll let it slide
[2:51:48] <danknugglit> Just chill with the backseating LUL
[2:51:51] <BinaryBetrayer> Look at the black hole from the edge
[2:51:52] <laguerrilha> even so it would be better to wait until you asked for help, not just spoil it
[2:51:52] <$oAlec687> so much salt lol
[2:52:00] <Dnarbredlih> le 56%
[2:52:02] <%demegodz> SELFIE
[2:52:04] <%CJett92> its you!
[2:52:05] <$RubberFistFight> @Fidranth not really, all you have to do is discover the hole doesn't kill you and the terrain falls through it as well - and he's done both of those multiple times. After that, it's just remembering how gravity works in space.
[2:52:05] <+Griffin1171> glamour shots
[2:52:05] <HeadsHeldHigh> It you :)
[2:52:05] <Junkles> tbh this was one of the few things I had to look up

[2:52:28] <%MagickBurritoh> it's a super mario galaxy level
[2:52:29] <ProfessorLitmus> space Pat is Baba
[2:52:30] <$RubberFistFight> @Reveresao exactly.
[2:52:31] <%Reveresao> there are hints there's no need to spoil
[2:52:32] <%RupanSen> more than Anor Londo?
[2:52:32] <Alphaetus_Prime> understanding this puzzle was one of the best moments in the game for me I woulda been pissed if it were spoiled
[2:52:34] <Endocrom> It's Nibbler's planet
[2:52:36] <aimlesshealer> Take a picture of your butt
[2:52:38] <%Fidranth> @RubberFistFight yeah but I'm an idiot
[2:52:38] <+Saltima> explore the dark bramble and shit yourself, pat
[2:52:42] <CatmanIX> how and why is there a black hole in the center of this planet?

[2:52:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> pat is NOT grown up. he is an adult tho
[2:52:48] <+Wakkadude21> there's a lot of incredible planets in this game
[2:52:49] <CatmanIX> no they don't
[2:52:49] <%depressed_skeleton> baaabaaa
[2:52:51] <SoySocks> so it's like the game asteroids
[2:52:52] <+jcenderion> It's like a second of difference
[2:52:53] <%juxtest> I hope Riebeck is okay
[2:52:56] <$RubberFistFight> Only 0.00001 seconds before
[2:52:56] <%GarbageQueenEllie> There it gooo
[2:52:56] <Caidezes> BIG THINK
[2:52:57] <%Frost_Quill> A very, very small amount of time before.

[2:53:00] <glaciusinfinite> baaabaa
[2:53:00] <%TaifuDragon> it's a millionth of a second of difference
[2:53:01] <corepool> bye

[2:53:15] <+Caped_Eggy> lionGalaxy lionGalaxy
[2:53:15] <%Frost_Quill> Like I don't think you could visually perceive it if you were looking at both.
[2:53:16] <majindusto> Think, Think, Think
[2:53:17] <sileo_patronus> not even a second
[2:53:21] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @AngriestPat on your left, what's that???
[2:53:22] <BinaryBetrayer> A hundredth of a second
[2:53:26] <$RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc well this is the "base" teleporter that they built the rest from, so...
[2:53:28] <eco419> Thinks can still go bad have faith in crazy talk

[2:59:30] <Broooomy> i think there was a second floor
[2:59:30] <$joylent_blue> 3
[2:59:31] <$MachoMadnesss94> the game will tell you if you miss things on the ship console
[2:59:31] <Alphaetus_Prime> there's no stone for the projector in there
[2:59:31] <MyNameIsRasus> youre good
[2:59:32] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 mama say mama sah ma maku sah. Mama say mama sah ma maku say. Mama say you bad at this game pat.
[2:59:33] <%brave_sj> I could be wrong
[2:59:34] <eco419> you got it
[2:59:36] <Tennochief> F
[2:59:37] <hntronium> He couldve put it in the projector
[2:59:37] <Broooomy> or not i guess
[2:59:39] <+Mr_Pylon> Pat there's a stone on 2nd floor
[2:59:40] <$ZE_Count> check the console pat
[2:59:40] <mr_slaide> Nailed it.
[2:59:41] <+pooperscooper14> the first thing he read was on the second floor
[2:59:41] <%Reveresao> he got it all, he just read it in a different place
[2:59:41] <%CJett92> 3, maybe like 2.5
[2:59:42] <sileo_patronus> the ship will say if you missed stuff, so don't trust chat
[2:59:44] <%dalmek> you're good
[2:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:51] <natebud> Ship log should tell us for sure
[2:59:53] <%Kirby_Sauce> Kirby here with his midnight shift break-time shitpost.
[2:59:55] <%Frost_Quill> You saw the read thing, you could have put it in the projector.
[2:59:57] <Tennochief> oooo
[2:59:57] <%brave_sj> @AngriestPat I might be wrong, the ship's log will know
[2:59:59] <eco419> @sileo_patronus he is right
[3:00:03] <%PanicSwytch> What's the objective of the game?
[3:00:03] <glaciusinfinite> CHAT is LIE
[3:00:04] <%Frost_Quill> I think.
[3:00:04] <$RubberFistFight> I love people turning up now saying YOU MISSED STUFF when he actually got that stuff LAST STREAM.
[3:00:07] <Tennochief> the moon
[3:00:09] <%Mdub98> Mdub98 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! I'm from the states and this Thursday is my 21st! finally I legally have a way to cope with working retail
[3:00:10] <eco419> Sorry
[3:00:10] <Alphaetus_Prime> you can't put those in the projector chat
[3:00:13] <PerrinIsDead> So this game looks fucking interesting
[3:00:17] <%Piemen99> @Kirby_Sauce hell yeah
[3:00:17] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> pat, the locker mark II
[3:00:22] <%Frost_Quill> Oh right, the scrolls are different.
[3:00:29] <BinaryBetrayer> I got it after the first stream. Currently stuck at the end.
[3:00:30] <$MachoMadnesss94> chat really shouldn't need to spoil anything since the ship log will tell you when you miss info at a certain location
[3:00:31] <%Piemen99> give me that shit
[3:00:35] <%CJett92> screm
[3:00:36] <InugamiTheHound> hoes mad!
[3:00:37] <$RubberFistFight> @Alphaetus_Prime but the projector tiles have logs in them you can use non-projector pillars to read
[3:00:38] <Ner234> screm
[3:00:38] <%BioApple> apatPorgmo
[3:00:39] <%demegodz> apatGib apatGib apatGib
[3:00:40] <$ZE_Count> I mean the console will tell ya if your missing important stuff but you can miss interesting backstory that has nothing to do with the mystery.
[3:00:40] <Louie_Salmon> @panicswytch Exploring
[3:00:42] <Smart_ZaK1> Wow we got a lot there
[3:00:50] <Alphaetus_Prime> @RubberFistFight there was no projector tile there
[3:00:54] <natebud> Looks pretty conclusive chat
[3:01:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> wait. how does the ship know this? does it scan your brain or something
[3:01:12] <%brave_sj> So you did get it wrong and I am the one who is wrong
[3:01:14] <Louie_Salmon> Alrighty, all good
[3:01:21] <eco419> You ..... did it
[3:01:35] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat can you remember any locations of the quantum moon that allowed you to go north? I sure could, and the best part is it's random to your game - so I could go north on a totally different version of the moon than you can.
[3:01:40] <%Frost_Quill> @Sphincter_Spelunker I think it's the main character putting it all together.
[3:01:46] <Alphaetus_Prime> @RubberFistFight yo shut up

[3:01:56] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> got it

[3:02:48] <sileo_patronus> It just means you've finished THOSE entries
[3:02:49] <Smart_ZaK1> I thought Pat was just saying Bramble over and over for funzies
[3:02:53] <PKLoveLucas> both the city and the observatory
[3:02:59] <$MachoMadnesss94> that's gonna be a no from me dawg

[3:03:01] <masterfire23> didn't reach the hanging city
[3:03:02] <Louie_Salmon> @rubberfistfight I think that's a little much on the spoilery front, I'm not sure he even knows there's multiple versions of it
[3:03:03] <$RubberFistFight> @Reveresao It's not a spoiler, it's something he did before.
[3:03:13] <%Frost_Quill> I thought the hanging city was the group of houses he explored.

[3:09:50] <CoffeeTableBlack> compass needle is red so i guess red is north
[3:09:51] <%CJett92> Perfect
[3:09:51] <Smart_ZaK1> LMAO
[3:09:52] <Hawkbone_> Red, since you always enter the moon at the south.
[3:09:53] <$MachoMadnesss94> LUL
[3:09:54] <%MagickBurritoh> whoops
[3:09:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> pat you always land at the south pole

[3:10:06] <BinaryBetrayer> Get the last mural place anyway.
[3:10:07] <$Dakuu75> we in space? are we looking for God?
[3:10:08] <%MakotoPB> when you forget the rules and launch instead of walking
[3:10:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> North is red 'cause the Union is full of Republicans
[3:10:10] <%fermentthegarbage> Why the fuck would you do such a thing patrick
[3:10:11] <Louie_Salmon> But how can this be
[3:10:13] <PKLoveLucas> you need the last rule
[3:10:14] <%MagickBurritoh> glowy
[3:10:14] <+Griffin1171> you're missing lessons anyways
[3:10:16] <+Mr_Pylon> red
[3:10:16] <%PinkSuprende> Pat you read a thing a long time ago that you can only land on the south pole
[3:10:18] <%Piemen99> dont crash
[3:10:19] <sileo_patronus> SPEEEED
[3:10:19] <BinaryBetrayer> Get the last lesson.
[3:10:20] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat remember you gotta visit the twins too at some point, you got a breadcrumb for that.
[3:10:20] <Alphaetus_Prime> @RubberFistFight has Pat literally already seen it/figured it out? if not, it's a spoiler
[3:10:20] <danknugglit> You need the third rule
[3:10:21] <BaronVonWidget> don't crash
[3:10:21] <%BioApple> @RubberFistFight you literally gave him the solution to a puzzle he didn't know existed until just now
[3:10:22] <hntronium> cmon third time
[3:10:23] <Hawkbone_> @Dakuu75 I guess we technically are.
[3:10:27] <Broooomy> @RubberFistFight a spoiler for this game is telling him the solution to a puzzle
[3:10:28] <MyNameIsRasus> you do need the law
[3:10:29] <hntronium> Third death is the charm
[3:10:34] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Didn't your parents ever teach you about retrorockets?
[3:10:36] <Smart_ZaK1> LAND
[3:10:38] <DRAGKUDO> here it vomes
[3:10:42] <$ZE_Count> Learn another rule on the twins
[3:10:43] <%crimsonharvest> @AngriestPat any advice for someone moving out for the first time? i'm disabled and the city is getting me a housing voucher soon
[3:10:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it's voming
[3:10:52] <Moonlight_Grimoire> best to finish off brittle first
[3:10:52] <+Griffin1171> dark bramble too
[3:11:01] <Youwereeatenbyalid> oh shit
[3:11:01] <DRAGKUDO> another ship?
[3:11:05] <$ZE_Count> blind
[3:11:07] <Youwereeatenbyalid> is that the other guys ship?
[3:11:08] <$ZE_Count> turn aorund
[3:11:08] <$RubberFistFight> @Broooomy I didn't though - he had literally just gotten the thing that said "the quantum tower has to be at the north pole of the moon"
[3:11:09] <%CJett92> what was on the ground?
[3:11:10] <eco419> OpieOP
[3:11:10] <$Dakuu75> lol, WUT-airlock. I just jump out the ONE door
[3:11:11] <+KenSmi> Whats left on hallow?
[3:11:11] <sileo_patronus> BLIND
[3:11:11] <MyNameIsRasus> i was gone for a loop, did he meet riebeck
[3:11:11] <czeekyplays> Radio Log
[3:11:12] <natebud> riebeck ship, seen
[3:11:14] <dekkitout> Baba. Is. Busted.
[3:11:15] <BinaryBetrayer> Radio Log
[3:11:16] <%Reveresao> it's a pain to get in that building almost died
[3:11:17] <+jcenderion> Pat you are SO BLIND
[3:11:18] <majindusto> SHITS LOCKED
[3:11:20] <$RubberFistFight> @Broooomy like he literally read it out, on stream.
[3:11:25] <Moonlight_Grimoire> you have to go from the equator, also there's a tape recorder by the entrance
[3:11:27] <+Griffin1171> use the busted door
[3:11:28] <mankeyfigh> from the inside
[3:11:30] <%Frost_Quill> Your buddy told you how.
[3:11:30] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @AngriestPat are you serious man?
[3:11:32] <Hawkbone_> Remember you learned the southern observatory entrance is at the equator.
[3:11:32] <Alphaetus_Prime> @RubberFistFight he didn't even realize there were multiple versions of the moon when you wrote your thing though
[3:11:34] <eco419> LET ME IIIIN
[3:11:39] <%BioApple> @RubberFistFight yeah, and he just now realized that getting to the north pole is a puzzle
[3:11:40] <$RubberFistFight> @MyNameIsRasus banjo man, underside of the hollow? Yeah.
[3:11:40] <Moonlight_Grimoire> logs said so on giant's deep XD
[3:11:43] <eco419> let me innn
[3:11:44] <Futurecity10> There is a literal trails
[3:11:45] <%BioApple> actually maybe he didn't
[3:11:46] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Everybody knows shit's locked, I don't give a good goddamn your Uncle Sam
[3:11:46] <glaciusinfinite> he smert
[3:11:48] <EuropantLamprey> I want Pat to get hit by a lava globule
[3:11:49] <%QuadraticGravity> BLIND
[3:11:50] <BinaryBetrayer> Not the planet to wander around on foot.
[3:11:54] <Smart_ZaK1> Go in from the inside?
[3:11:55] <$MachoMadnesss94> @RubberFistFight yes but he doesn't know how to get it there yet because he doesn't have all the rules, only two of them
[3:11:55] <MyNameIsRasus> remember what you learned at giants deep
[3:11:56] <%crimsonharvest> go to the other ship and look at the damn path lol
[3:12:04] <$ZE_Count> Super blind
[3:12:08] <danknugglit> Hes doing his best guys
[3:12:08] <$Dakuu75> wouldn't the UV raise from that sun have killed you instantly? unless this "planet" has clear and strong atmosphere?
[3:12:10] <Alphaetus_Prime> you found this last stream
[3:12:11] <%realm_forge> Squid1 Squid2 Squid3 Squid2 Squid4
[3:12:12] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> don't talk bad about my non-existent Uncle Sam
[3:12:13] <natebud> We saw the ship already
[3:12:13] <eco419> LUL
[3:12:13] <Louie_Salmon> @garbagequeenellie Oh man, someone must have made that by now right?
[3:12:21] <$MachoMadnesss94> @RubberFistFight he only has the first and third I believe
[3:12:25] <$RubberFistFight> @MachoMadnesss94 and that's the part I didn't spoil, because I know he hasn't had that rule yet, and I know he doesn't know how to make the tower move.
[3:12:28] <$ZE_Count> you kinda skipped this part
[3:12:36] <Alphaetus_Prime> @RubberFistFight you still spoiled shit
[3:12:39] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Louie_Salmon If not, we need to kickstart that shit
[3:12:43] <%TaifuDragon> Holy fuck shut up
[3:12:47] <eco419> calm down
[3:12:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> settle down, ladies
[3:12:50] <coldparty> When I accomplish anything the first thing I do is record myself speaking and then leave the recording right where I was standing instead of filing it away.
[3:12:53] <Moonlight_Grimoire> huh, that's cool, redundant clues
[3:12:55] <Youwereeatenbyalid> bye other ship
[3:13:04] <%realm_forge> IM NOT SHOUTING!
[3:13:06] <Moonlight_Grimoire> honestly, that would be nice
[3:13:06] <%dalmek> @angriestpat you can see the globe on the lending view
[3:13:07] <filialpails> are you trying to say "compass"?
[3:13:09] <+Despera__> @AngriestPat PRESS LANDING MODE
[3:13:10] <$ZE_Count> landing mode pat
[3:13:14] <BinaryBetrayer> You're both suspended.
[3:13:17] <$ZE_Count> check out landing map it ha smap
[3:13:21] <hntronium> The gravity crystal path?
[3:13:24] <+Despera__> @AngriestPat IT SHOWS ORIENTATION IN LANDING MODE
[3:13:24] <$Dakuu75> let's mine rocks from mars or jupiter and dump them on pluto untill it's big enough to be a planet again.
[3:13:25] <Alphaetus_Prime> he means he wants to see the minimap while in the ship
[3:13:27] <Alphaetus_Prime> and he's right tbh
[3:13:39] <%Frost_Quill> It shows the glove.
[3:13:40] <Moonlight_Grimoire> oh
[3:13:41] <%GarbageQueenEllie> nifty
[3:13:42] <%Frost_Quill> Globe
[3:13:42] <Alphaetus_Prime> holy fuck I never noticed that
[3:13:46] <eco419> you got it
[3:13:47] <dekkitout> Guess this is as close to 'orbiting
[3:13:48] <%arcaderabbit48> So about how much longer is there in the game? Or is that also a spoiler?
[3:13:49] <mr_slaide> Ghost farts/
[3:13:49] <MyNameIsRasus> holi shit thats rad
[3:13:53] <%crimsonharvest> do you want to know some space orientation words @AngriestPat ? the direction the planet is moving is called prograde, and moving directly away from it is called the 'normal' direction
[3:13:54] <Smart_ZaK1> You can also see north and south
[3:14:09] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @crimsonharvest hey now, let's not scare him
[3:14:11] <knightmatty21> so this is game of the year
[3:14:20] <+Griffin1171> just find a hole in the planet
[3:14:25] <mankeyfigh> from the quantum area workd PAT
[3:14:25] <$RubberFistFight> @arcaderabbit48 technically you can solve it on the first loop if you know how. The length of the game depends entirely on how long itt akes you to piece the clues together.
[3:14:25] <Hawkbone_> Just fly through a broken bit of crust
[3:14:26] <%Yadogari> Just dig a hole
[3:14:28] <%kiiiirsten> Pat? Lost? Nahhhhhhhh
[3:14:31] <+Despera__> @AngriestPat You can also take off in landing mode and it makes it way easier
[3:14:32] <czeekyplays> @AngriestPat Really? Couldn't tell.
[3:14:34] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hi patty
[3:14:34] <Moonlight_Grimoire> look for the camp fire smoke
[3:14:37] <$MachoMadnesss94> getting lost is part of the fun
[3:14:38] <%wolfofsound> dig up stupid
[3:14:41] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah Hollow Brittle is hard to memorize
[3:14:43] <BinaryBetrayer> You can fly underneath the crust with the ship to make it fast.
[3:14:44] <%BioApple> @arcaderabbit48 it's all puzzles so it all depends on pat i guess
[3:14:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> !uptime
[3:14:45] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 14m.
[3:14:45] <MyNameIsRasus> read the log on your ship in planet mode

[3:15:08] <%crimsonharvest> oh man that gravatic lensing will just RUIN your sanity
[3:15:09] <haitakaa> is this THE Woolie Hole TM??
[3:15:09] <sileo_patronus> I don't think you can land anywhere inside the planet
[3:15:10] <%arcaderabbit48> So what people are telling me is that this is going to take a while
[3:15:12] <Tennochief> OH NO
[3:15:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEEEEEEEEE
[3:15:15] <Alphaetus_Prime> lmao
[3:15:19] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> he's trying so hard
[3:15:22] <Tersalus> solution for whole game? push hard. door broke? push hard. tower move? push hard. easy game for babies
[3:15:23] <Louie_Salmon> Playing it so fast and loose
[3:15:25] <EuropantLamprey> FIGHT THAT BLACK HOLE
[3:15:25] <eco419> oh oh

[3:15:27] <Alphaetus_Prime> @arcaderabbit48 oh yes

[3:15:35] <%NWR_James> NWR_James subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! Happy birthday to the stream baby. No jokes this month, I missed most of the stream playing Judgment. Sure there's huge crimes to investigate but Im just here playing VR money games like a Yakuza hero
[3:15:35] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 300000000IQ
[3:15:38] <dekkitout> Do it again~!
[3:15:40] <$Dakuu75> this planet has a colon.
[3:15:40] <Tennochief> ANTI SPIRAL MENACE
[3:15:41] <%TaifuDragon> It's super easy
[3:15:43] <%TaifuDragon> just land on the bridge
[3:15:47] <+Griffin1171> roof
[3:15:47] <Youwereeatenbyalid> what the fuck is the event horizon for this black hole?
[3:15:52] <Moonlight_Grimoire> all on the top of the ship?
[3:15:55] <MyNameIsRasus> roof
[3:15:57] <Alphaetus_Prime> LEAKING monkaS
[3:16:03] <%wolfofsound> 0%
[3:16:03] <Youwereeatenbyalid> because its clearly absurdly close to the perimeter
[3:16:04] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> mmm, orange crush
[3:16:11] <+Griffin1171> LCL
[3:16:13] <%Yadogari> 0% LUL
[3:16:16] <jorgenbob> not even light itself can escape but pat escaped
[3:16:17] <+attackofthesage> Does this game have lovecraftian space monstrosities?
[3:16:19] <dekkitout> Anyone else wants a molten rock to Wily Coyote Pat?
[3:16:22] <+attackofthesage> I think that'd be fun
[3:16:24] <haitakaa> Sunny D leakage
[3:16:25] <+Sestren413> eject button
[3:16:26] <$RubberFistFight> @Youwereeatenbyalid it's about half as wide as the sun, which makes it considerably more massive, but I'm pretty sure it's not a natural black hole.
[3:16:26] <%SvenHolgersson> Thank god for magic fixit item
[3:16:29] <$Dakuu75> @dekkitout little bit
[3:16:31] <%wolfofsound> @attackofthesage can't confirm nor deny
[3:16:38] <MyNameIsRasus> @attackofthesage kinda
[3:16:38] <mankeyfigh> QUANTUM AREA
[3:16:40] <%Frost_Quill> @attackofthesage I mean, kind of?
[3:16:42] <eco419> thx flex tape
[3:16:43] <+attackofthesage> cooooool
[3:16:43] <Hawkbone_> Well the Black Hole is also absurdly small. I don't think it could even exist at this size in real life.
[3:16:44] <%QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat small tree village with smoke
[3:16:44] <+Griffin1171> tower stairs
[3:16:45] <Moonlight_Grimoire> look for smoke
[3:16:46] <Alphaetus_Prime> it was from the place with the smoke
[3:16:50] <BinaryBetrayer> Escape pod trail
[3:16:51] <mankeyfigh> TOWER STAIRS
[3:16:51] <thunderborn32> you were onit
[3:16:53] <%dalmek> by the escape pod
[3:16:55] <caliento> pod
[3:16:56] <laguerrilha> the pod?
[3:16:57] <Alphaetus_Prime> @AngriestPat look for column of smoke, or the escape pod
[3:16:57] <+eleleliot> escape pod
[3:16:57] <Moonlight_Grimoire> trees and smoke
[3:16:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> supermassive black HOLE
[3:16:58] <PKLoveLucas> I mean, basically every landmark has one
[3:17:00] <$luckypineapple> it was in space
[3:17:00] <sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat the building covered in trees
[3:17:00] <BinaryBetrayer> Escape pod had a trail.
[3:17:01] <%arcaderabbit48> "I know can't remember X" has kinda been the theme of this stream
[3:17:01] <Louie_Salmon> There's multiple, they all lead together
[3:17:02] <Tersalus> I dont even know if this is true, but I love the idea that someone could potentially beat the game insanely quickly on accident
[3:17:03] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat quantum tower or the ruins on the equator, or you just fly in and land on that bridge
[3:17:03] <Pixel_gee> You can find it with the escape pod- it has a frequency
[3:17:05] <$Dakuu75> I can't remember what you said 30 seconds ago. don't as me to remember anything
[3:17:06] <+Sestren413> @AngriestPat When in doubt, use the eject button. It always helps
[3:17:11] <danknugglit> Follow your heart
[3:17:18] <$Dakuu75> heart of the cards
[3:17:23] <%Teintstein> Cheer1500 I'm dipping out to get some sleep before I land, but before I go I figure I'll take the top bit spot before I sober up - enjoy the stream y'all
[3:17:25] <+jcenderion> Just go in through the gravity cannon
[3:17:25] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @RubberFistFight yeah that much is clear. Black hole of this size should shred everything that goes near it like swiss cheeze before it gets a chance to get stuck inside
[3:17:26] <haitakaa> covered in bees
[3:17:26] <MyNameIsRasus> signalscope will find you the pod
[3:17:30] <$ZE_Count> hes goign to fall in the black hole
[3:17:32] <+Griffin1171> refuel
[3:17:33] <$RubberFistFight> @Hawkbone_ sure it could. A black hole with 1.5x the mass of our sun would be 4.5km in radius.
[3:17:36] <jorgenbob> no fuel
[3:17:39] <+Griffin1171> fuckit
[3:17:41] <Endocrom> Might wanna fue...
[3:17:44] <BinaryBetrayer> I've never tried landing on the lava moon.
[3:17:46] <sileo_patronus> wheeee
[3:17:49] <$MachoMadnesss94> you can still do it, I believe
[3:17:49] <%dave323dave> parkour
[3:17:50] <+Griffin1171> meet up with Riebeck
[3:17:51] <czeekyplays> @Youwereeatenbyalid Yeah but gameplay
[3:17:51] <$Dakuu75> @Teintstein kudos, dude. Have a good one. Cheers~
[3:17:53] <%Fidranth> black hole of that size would have sucked in that whole solar system
[3:18:00] <eco419> is fineee
[3:18:01] <sileo_patronus> oh you meant this path ok
[3:18:01] <Alphaetus_Prime> monkaS
[3:18:07] <$ZE_Count> no
[3:18:08] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @czeekyplays hey they could explain it in game maybe
[3:18:10] <+Criox1388> You and Klemps need to do another podcast episode
[3:18:10] <%QuadraticGravity> you're super not
[3:18:14] <MyNameIsRasus> @Fidranth thanks neil d grasse tyson
[3:18:15] <$Dakuu75> @Fidranth if not more, lol.
[3:18:16] <sileo_patronus> looks like no
[3:18:17] <Smart_ZaK1> It works if you just don't think about it
[3:18:18] <$RubberFistFight> @Youwereeatenbyalid well, you say "before", and black holes play crazy with time, so "before" from whose frame of reference?
[3:18:19] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It's always so weird to me that the gravity is ALWAYS 0.0x while you're in the air
[3:18:23] <Youwereeatenbyalid> noooooope
[3:18:25] <sileo_patronus> RIP
[3:18:26] <%GarbageQueenEllie> A black hole of this size would've sucked in your mom
[3:18:27] <Tersalus> where even is pat right now?
[3:18:38] <+Griffin1171> might as well
[3:18:39] <eco419> SeemsGood

[3:19:03] <Alphaetus_Prime> I mean the solar system is like 100 km across
[3:19:04] <%BioApple> @Youwereeatenbyalid I think like the "quantum" stuff you're just supposed to accept that the universe runs on 8th-grade physics
[3:19:04] <mankeyfigh> @AngriestPat The tower stairs are more direct
[3:19:06] <Hawkbone_> @ZE_Count He's trying to find a way into the southern observatory.
[3:19:06] <PKLoveLucas> the surface village leads to the crossroads tho, and those lead almost everywhere
[3:19:07] <sileo_patronus> @GarbageQueenEllie only if your mom didn't suck it first
[3:19:07] <Alphaetus_Prime> So don't worry about it too much
[3:19:08] <alrobot2014> so do you have to get to the escape pod before it gets sucked into the black hole?
[3:19:12] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Hunk_Of_Dunk Maybe the sensor is based on calculating on the force felt on your feet?
[3:19:13] <$MachoMadnesss94> Yay

[3:19:35] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @RubberFistFight yeah most of the stuff I've seen is great.
[3:19:39] <EuropantLamprey> Do we?
[3:19:43] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @XeroSigmaPrime That's a more reasonable answer than I could've come up with
[3:19:44] <haitakaa> giant's derp

[3:25:16] <eco419> good nuff
[3:25:17] <%TaifuDragon> You people are awful at this

[3:25:53] <$RubberFistFight> @thunderborn32 I tried making that point earlier and still got told off.
[3:25:53] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Youwereeatenbyalid All you would need is two gyro and a computer to measure the difference between forces experienced between to gyros. Similar to how Submarines calculate depth pressure and turbine acceleration
[3:25:55] <$Dakuu75> PARKOUR~!
[3:26:00] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Now do a Naruto run
[3:26:03] <haitakaa> hit the nitro

[3:26:07] <Alphaetus_Prime> @thunderborn32 he doesn't fuckin know where this path goes yet so let him discover it
[3:26:09] <%TaifuDragon> The chat should be put on emote only permanently so long as this game is on display
[3:26:10] <Deekman> I beat this game like a week ago and never saw this path...
[3:26:12] <natebud> follow the racing lines

[3:26:51] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Youwereeatenbyalid Infact it is very easy (easy being relative to technology that is existing in our time, I couldnt do it lol)

[3:26:57] <$RubberFistFight> @dekkitout it's easy once you know the ending solution, since finding all these clues is simply so you can put together the ending solution.
[3:26:58] <+WyvernsArentDragons> monkaS

[3:27:11] <$ZE_Count> the city
[3:27:13] <PKLoveLucas> wow that was almost the biggest stumbo of them all
[3:27:15] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @XeroSigmaPrime fair enough then. You're knowledge of physics eclipses mine.
[3:27:18] <eco419> SeemsGood
[3:27:26] <Alphaetus_Prime> see? we would've missed that if he listened to chat
[3:27:27] <BinaryBetrayer> Watch him fall.
[3:27:27] <haitakaa> is this a sinking city? Kappa
[3:27:28] <%Gray_skies1993> now DON"T fall off the bridges
[3:27:30] <%Frost_Quill> @RubberFistFight Can you actually? I've been told the game will stop you.
[3:27:33] <$Dakuu75> the lights in this dimensional ruin are still on?
[3:27:38] <$ZE_Count> yep
[3:27:40] <%GarbageQueenEllie> all these squares make a circle. all these squares make a circle. all these squares make a --
[3:27:41] <%Yadogari> stop looking over the edge pat NotLikeThis
[3:27:42] <+Griffin1171> yup
[3:27:42] <Youwereeatenbyalid> good fucking call there
[3:27:45] <%Frost_Quill> Stay away from those fucking edges Pat.
[3:27:47] <BaronVonWidget> pat. Don't fall

[3:27:49] <+Griffin1171> dont
[3:27:51] <%crimsonharvest> actual legit 'watch out about staring into the abyss' warning here sheesh
[3:27:53] <Youwereeatenbyalid> do. NOT. fall.
[3:27:54] <dekkitout> You mean Western Air Temple?
[3:27:59] <danknugglit> "space music"
[3:28:01] <@lewdskeletor13> The Sinking City?
[3:28:02] <Xelhesia> this game gives me fucking panic attacks
[3:28:07] <$MachoMadnesss94> sad space music
[3:28:09] <bashful_bard> This would probably be overwhelmingly horrible to live through
[3:28:09] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Youwereeatenbyalid The game just says its 0 in the air to simplify it. In reality theres alot more numbers and alot more sources of gravity
[3:28:09] <BinaryBetrayer> So many skeletons.
[3:28:15] <+DingusMcFadden> Hanging City? More like Spooky-Town Junction, chat
[3:28:15] <+ThatButler> What's a ghost matter?
[3:28:16] <natebud> This place is haunted
[3:28:17] <suikudo> to hell

[3:28:26] <BinaryBetrayer> Theme of dead race.
[3:28:27] <@commanderclaw> Gravity is a social construct
[3:28:27] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Youwereeatenbyalid Lol sorry for overkill, aerospace engineer here

[3:28:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> but with ghosts
[3:28:36] <+Griffin1171> it's like snow
[3:28:36] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @XeroSigmaPrime wait, what are we defining as gravity here? The force of gravity I assume?
[3:28:39] <$Dakuu75> except ghost matter had a soul?
[3:28:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> aw, deathly ghost spum
[3:28:42] <Louie_Salmon> Ghosts are just anti-alive
[3:28:43] <%DedlokPM> @ThatButler Matter that ghosts are made of

[3:29:13] <PerrinIsDead> Black hole forge?/?
[3:29:13] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Ghost farts matter
[3:29:16] <%crimsonharvest> you went up one floor
[3:29:17] <Broooomy> and hes already mixing the names up
[3:29:18] <%Frost_Quill> Signs on different floots.
[3:29:19] <Endocrom> It's a legend
[3:29:20] <$RubberFistFight> @osiris1260 only when it's combined with equal parts normal mater at 1:1 equivalence of particles.
[3:29:22] <%crimsonharvest> and every floor has the map, like a mall
[3:29:23] <eco419> LUL
[3:29:23] <%Frost_Quill> It makes sense Pat.
[3:29:23] <suikudo> black hole forge sounds like where dark knights will get new relic weapons
[3:29:31] <sileo_patronus> has pat been in a mall before?
[3:29:32] <%MagickBurritoh> go to school
[3:29:34] <danknugglit> What is up even LUL

[3:29:48] <eco419> MrDestructoid
[3:29:49] <%crimsonharvest> is it going to the surface?
[3:29:52] <$MachoMadnesss94> don't tell him chat!
[3:29:53] <haitakaa> Pat created a Brown Hole on his couch Kappa
[3:29:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> don't know what this does, better touch it
[3:29:54] <+Griffin1171> INFODUMP
[3:29:55] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Youwereeatenbyalid Chyea, the force of gravity. But theres also like 20 different forces of gravity that are significant to the "player's" perspective because of how small these planets are
[3:29:56] <%MagickBurritoh> uhh
[3:29:57] <osiris1260> Wow, I took a completely different path to get here
[3:29:57] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> *confused pat noises*
[3:29:58] <Deekman> @crimsonharvest nope lol
[3:30:00] <Tennochief> I don't know shit
[3:30:02] <+WyvernsArentDragons> oh wow, there is a lot here
[3:30:04] <$Dakuu75> look at this M.C. Escher bull shit.
[3:30:06] <dekkitout> "Forged in the heart of a black hole, this blade is so dense, it cuts through light"
[3:30:13] <%MagickBurritoh> Why would you just touch it immediately
[3:30:22] <%crimsonharvest> this lensing is hurting my psyche
[3:30:31] <natebud> If there was ever a time to enable "pause when reading" it's now
[3:30:32] <majindusto> Pat carelessly flips switch. WHAT DID I DO?
[3:30:33] <eco419> 'pat used confuse on himself
[3:30:35] <HeadsHeldHigh> mee-entor
[3:30:36] <Thedingusmcmingus> What kind of game is this?
[3:30:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> myentor
[3:30:38] <Xelhesia> head is hurting now
[3:30:40] <%DedlokPM> @MagickBurritoh Why wouldn't YOU? apatWhat
[3:30:40] <%Frost_Quill> "meantor"
[3:30:48] <+timblenaut> ooooooh enemies?
[3:30:50] <$MachoMadnesss94> @eco419 it's super effective
[3:30:50] <danknugglit> A good game
[3:30:55] <$Dakuu75> avoid the angler-fish. it deserves to to be ignored
[3:31:06] <eco419> LUL LUL
[3:31:07] <%arcaderabbit48> This game seems very dull
[3:31:15] <dekkitout> Say 'anglerfish' one more time
[3:31:16] <$RubberFistFight> so the ash twin has an advanced core
[3:31:23] <czeekyplays> @arcaderabbit48 say syke right now
[3:31:25] <Louie_Salmon> @arcaderabbit48 You're dull
[3:31:25] <Nina96> !uptime
[3:31:26] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 31m.
[3:31:26] <Endocrom> Ship's busted, use this convenient black hole
[3:31:31] <$MachoMadnesss94> @arcaderabbit48 not when you're the one playing it
[3:31:33] <sileo_patronus> @arcaderabbit48 as does everything if you're the right person
[3:31:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no u
[3:31:41] <Hawkbone_> @arcaderabbit48 Bad taste
[3:31:43] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @XeroSigmaPrime oh I think I see then. Then yeah I assume that sensor measures "weight" as in force being resisted(?) by whatever you are being pushed into/the gravity you would "feel" (might be missing the correct words here)
[3:31:50] <%DedlokPM> @arcaderabbit48 Good thing no one is forcing you to watch it. mogsUp teenJOY
[3:31:53] <$Dakuu75> @dekkitout I await with baited breathe for him to say it again
[3:31:55] <Smart_ZaK1> Exploring space is not for everyone
[3:32:25] <$RubberFistFight> @Youwereeatenbyalid all "weight" actually is is gravity pushing you down against the surface of whatever you're standing on. That's why you weigh less on the moon, and more on jupiter.
[3:32:38] <DRAGKUDO> damn y'all didn't ha e to jump on them
[3:32:43] <%crimsonharvest> so the black hole forge is what you clicked the button for, maybe its online or accessible now or wahtever
[3:32:45] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Jupiter says I'm fat :(
[3:32:45] <eco419> is a fantastic world , for me is what no man sky should have been
[3:32:48] <$RubberFistFight> "weight" is just the interaction of mass and gravity.
[3:33:02] <$Dakuu75> how long until he bashes his glass, space-helmet into a wall again? that's what I'm waiting for
[3:33:03] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @RubberFistFight yes I'm aware, that's what I was referring to. Technically gravity applies at all points, but you only "feel" it when it's being resisted
[3:33:04] <Alphaetus_Prime> I honestly don't understand why people keep comparing this to no mans sky
[3:33:04] <HeadsHeldHigh> BibleThump
[3:33:10] <sileo_patronus> @DRAGKUDO it's not like shit in twitch chat is orchestrated
[3:33:14] <Alphaetus_Prime> The games are NOTHING alike apart from being in space
[3:33:18] <dekkitout> Deez nutz are also an interaction of mass and gravity
[3:33:27] <$RubberFistFight> @Alphaetus_Prime so theyu'
[3:33:29] <mankeyfigh> I DONT THINK Nomai live that long naturally
[3:33:32] <Tisaric> It seems like what no man's sky promised when you first leave the planet but yeah it's not really alike
[3:33:36] <$RubberFistFight> @Alphaetus_Prime so they're identical then Kappa
[3:33:36] <Broooomy> @Alphaetus_Prime cause thier both about exploration
[3:33:40] <Hawkbone_> @Alphaetus_Prime This game is an entirely different genre from NMS
[3:33:42] <eco419> what should have been my dude
[3:33:43] <czeekyplays> @Alphaetus_Prime Different takes on what a space exploration could be, I guess?
[3:33:45] <BinaryBetrayer> The Nomai make me so sad.
[3:33:46] <$ZE_Count> oh yeah
[3:33:49] <+Estuko> what have I missed since last stream monkaS
[3:33:50] <+Despera__> @Alphaetus_Prime It's what people wanted NMS to be
[3:33:53] <czeekyplays> space exploration game*
[3:33:53] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Youwereeatenbyalid Chyea you got it in simple terms!
[3:33:54] <Youwereeatenbyalid> This feels like the only "hard" sci-fi videogame I've seen.
[3:33:56] <$RubberFistFight> @Hawkbone_ no but they're in space so they're the same.
[3:34:00] <Louie_Salmon> No Man's Sky should have been this. Randomized survival game was the wrong genre.
[3:34:06] <eco419> way to twist my words
[3:34:08] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @XeroSigmaPrime nice to know physics 101 has not failed me.
[3:34:09] <$ZE_Count> keepgoing up
[3:34:13] <Futurecity10> This is hurting my fucking gead
[3:34:13] <$Dakuu75> down the rabbit hole Alice
[3:34:15] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> this has a narrative, No Man's Sky was just go out and do it. exploring is about the only thing in common
[3:34:21] <%brave_sj> This is important, keep going up
[3:34:21] <%Frost_Quill> Oh this is the entrance you find that's blocked.
[3:34:23] <$ZE_Count> SHortCUT
[3:34:25] <%Frost_Quill> I think.
[3:34:27] <$ZE_Count> hahahah

[3:34:50] <+Griffin1171> put it in the books
[3:34:55] <majindusto> SHORTCUT UNLOCKED
[3:34:56] <Quantumsheep1> My understanding is that the plot they eventually added to NMS (and they did eventually add a big-ass plot) has a lot of similar themes going on
[3:35:03] <%TaifuDragon> the progress in this game is 100% knowledge
[3:35:05] <osiris1260> Didn’t see that entrance either, I took the third way
[3:35:06] <danknugglit> Remember where thats at on the map
[3:35:07] <glaciusinfinite> but now you know

[3:35:11] <Alphaetus_Prime> @crimsonharvest more like 99% but yeah
[3:35:11] <%TaifuDragon> it literally restarts in the same state every 20 minutes
[3:35:11] <thunderborn32> you can save even more time coming back if you used the stairs
[3:35:18] <$ZE_Count> school got some enat abckstory
[3:35:19] <BinaryBetrayer> I love how progress in the game is 100%. There's no rocket doors, or red access card. The power up is knowledge.
[3:35:21] <Hawkbone_> @crimsonharvest Its 100% just what the player knows. You can finished the game in a single cycle if you knew how
[3:35:28] <Tisaric> And yeah you can one cycle this game if you know what to do
[3:35:28] <%Frost_Quill> Yeah that's the cool thing about this game. You're not changing anything about the world, you're not unlocking any abilities, you're just LEARNING.
[3:35:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> GER is the "I win" button
[3:35:32] <+Mr_FruitzNutz> i heart pat is in an endless loop of twerking every 22 minutes
[3:35:33] <Endocrom> Notice how the crummy gravity tech like the one in your ship has wobbly lines, while the good alien tech has straight lines
[3:35:37] <%DedlokPM> @DRAGKUDO My philosophy is if someone comes into a chat, says something completely unnecessary that they can fix themselves very easily without having to inform everyone/giving unconstructiive criticism, to repay it back with snarky responses of how they could alleviate themselves of said problem.
[3:35:44] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @RubberFistFight I mean it's certainly harder than a lot of shit in videogame sci-fi. Thematically it seems more in the right place for hard sci-fi, focus on exploration and knowledge and all that.
[3:35:45] <$ZE_Count> timeloops man
[3:35:45] <Alphaetus_Prime> Being able to meditate from the menu is like the only "upgrade" you can get
[3:35:53] <$Dakuu75> you can do it skeleton!
[3:36:01] <Alphaetus_Prime> cuz everything resets when the sun explodes
[3:36:03] <+WyvernsArentDragons> I kinda love the idea of exploring an ancient abandoned city while the entire planet crumbles around you
[3:36:09] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @RubberFistFight Hahah if it acted like a real black hole, well shit would get fucked both with time and getting torn apart.
[3:36:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @DedlokPM r/Imamverysmart
[3:36:23] <absolute_cagemony> knowledge n shit, bitches *gang signs*
[3:36:26] <%Gray_skies1993> @WyvernsArentDragons right?
[3:36:30] <eco419> is a good exploration game not good for twitch
[3:36:32] <+Mr_FruitzNutz> has anyone seen the Netflix series Dark? if you're into this game you might be interested in the show
[3:36:43] <DRAGKUDO> @dedlokpm DeAll they said was it looks dull.
[3:36:44] <$Dakuu75> fucking-WUT. Space-trees?!
[3:36:51] <absolute_cagemony> Dark? Is that the sequal to Bright?
[3:36:56] <+Griffin1171> remember the best time to plant a tree is right now
[3:36:58] <dekkitout> Are we on God already?
[3:36:59] <$RubberFistFight> @Mr_FruitzNutz season 2 coming out soon, can't wait. That series was fucking incredible.
[3:36:59] <BlindGato> Any means of leaving waypoints or markers ala subnautica?
[3:36:59] <Tisaric> I tried watching Dark and it defaulted to english audio and tripped me the hell out
[3:37:12] <Tisaric> I need to go back and put it in german
[3:37:15] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @RubberFistFight Also, I did point out that black hole should be shredding anything that goes through it, never mind the wormhole. That said, how hard would it be to tell the difference between a black hole and a hypothetical "worm hole"?
[3:37:16] <Endocrom> I'm calling it. It's Galactus, the game ends with you getting eaten.
[3:37:16] <+Mr_FruitzNutz> @absolute_cagemony , nah its completely diff. show made in Germany @RubberFistFight , season 2 is already out!
[3:37:16] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Calling it: The Eye is God
[3:37:19] <$RubberFistFight> @BlindGato why bother? Everything's on a 22 minute loop, and your globe marks your path.
[3:37:22] <%srkAres> i like my universe like i like my women. hot and dense
[3:37:33] <$RubberFistFight> @Mr_FruitzNutz oh are you for fucken real? AWESOME!!

[3:37:47] <Tennochief> Open, your mind's eye
[3:37:48] <Nina96> is it wrong that iam enjoying essay chat?
[3:37:49] <+Mr_FruitzNutz> @RubberFistFight now i'm waiting for season 3, the long wait.....
[3:37:49] <absolute_cagemony> And all the girls say he's pretty fly for a space eye
[3:37:51] <aimlesshealer> Bad shit
[3:37:52] <SoySocks> those good vibrations
[3:37:53] <%DedlokPM> @DRAGKUDO Yes. And there are many streams where I came to watch where I also found the thing being played dull. In those cases I just silently leave the stream and find something else to do or watch.
[3:37:54] <Smart_ZaK1> Turn up the radio
[3:37:54] <%kiiiirsten> Pat the Intolerant
[3:37:58] <Endocrom> Become whole!
[3:37:58] <+MellowMute> Hush the nonbeliever!
[3:38:05] <$Dakuu75> we have those on earth. those guys lsitening to space from their giant satalite dishes
[3:38:06] <%Frost_Quill> I could see people worshipping a radio signal that's older than the universe.
[3:38:06] <%keye90> keye90 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Thanks for everything cat dad
[3:38:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> is that a radio signal?? lets start a CULT!!
[3:38:16] <+Hinasil> The Radio Signal in the Sky!
[3:38:20] <$MachoMadnesss94> you can make a religion out of this
[3:38:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> is this some dead space shit
[3:38:25] <$MachoMadnesss94> wait no don
[3:38:29] <Smart_ZaK1> You ever hear a song so good you want to start a cult?
[3:38:29] <$MachoMadnesss94> dont
[3:38:29] <dekkitout> And then, the Nomai all drank the Wool-aid
[3:38:30] <absolute_cagemony> I'm just waiting for this game to reveal that it's a prequal to Dead Space...
[3:38:30] <Tisaric> God I'm just remembering all the cool shit you end up finding in this game
[3:38:33] <EuropantLamprey> To be fair, if you are going to make a religion, basing it around a radio signal older than the universe is a good thing to base it upon
[3:38:40] <%GarbageQueenEllie> These goat people wanna get that 4th eyeball
[3:38:43] <%juxtest> What if its just making noise
[3:38:43] <$MachoMadnesss94> true
[3:38:47] <Tisaric> There's so much cool ass setpieces you just come across
[3:38:51] <%Reveresao> @desudesudokidoki pretty much lul
[3:38:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> The radio signal decrypts into "SEND NUDES"
[3:38:57] <+Estuko> Waiting for these stupid sexy cosmic horrors
[3:39:00] <+MisterCrimson> OR...This is a multiverse situation and every reset is a new universe
[3:39:04] <BinaryBetrayer> Time to go back to the Forge.
[3:39:09] <Nina96> what if the signal says it needs more power?
[3:39:09] <%Reveresao> it fall
[3:39:10] <%BioApple> that "expressing itself" line makes me think the Eye is just some emo teen sending out his mixtape
[3:39:12] <+WyvernsArentDragons> fell into the black hole I guess
[3:39:20] <Tisaric> can't get to the forge this way
[3:39:21] <+jcenderion> Hey look one of those teleporty platforms
[3:39:26] <$ZE_Count> Look at it pat
[3:39:28] <%crimsonharvest> @AngriestPat my guess it fell through the crust or got bounced into space by the lava moon meteors
[3:39:30] <Alphaetus_Prime> let him figure it out chat
[3:39:34] <Tennochief> The ancient signal actually says: "Jojo is shit"
[3:39:41] <danknugglit> Plague why are there no space furries
[3:39:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> woolie will figure it out
[3:39:41] <suikudo> why would you do that?
[3:39:46] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Youwereeatenbyalid A worm hole isnt really possible to recognize based on how it looks. We really cant visualize the idea of a wormhole in the way we see the world hahah
[3:39:47] <sniffy77> did mc esher design this fucking place?
[3:39:56] <%AraghastTheVintager> AraghastTheVintager subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! 
[3:39:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Translated Eye signal: "Clean your room"
[3:40:07] <$ZE_Count> again look at it
[3:40:13] <Tisaric> oh are we at the end of the loop I don't remember how the song starts
[3:40:16] <%Frost_Quill> This game is so goddamn COOL.
[3:40:20] <$RubberFistFight> @MisterCrimson nope, game has already made what's going on re: the time loop very clear. It's a 22-minute psuedo-loop caused by memories being beamed back by that long.
[3:40:23] <absolute_cagemony> Woolie can't even keep his Jojo facts straight how the fuck is he gonna figure out SPACE?
[3:40:24] <BinaryBetrayer> This song is so sad.
[3:40:25] <aimlesshealer> Translated Eye signal: Baaaaaaa baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[3:40:25] <+MellowMute> The eye says "Drink more Ovaltine"
[3:40:27] <Nina96> Woolie will figure it out, pat will roll around and than get it somehow
[3:40:34] <+jcenderion> Look at it closely pat
[3:40:36] <Hawkbone_> The eye is broadcasting what the actual best waifu is. Thats why its the most important thing in the universe.
[3:40:39] <%Reveresao> Pat channel Tom Cruise
[3:40:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> just because my room is messy, doesn't mean I don't know where everything is. gosh, mom!
[3:40:43] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @XeroSigmaPrime they are supposed to share some similarities with black holes though, right?
[3:40:44] <Tisaric> I fucking love how the soundtrack weaves in at pivotal moments
[3:40:44] <+Estuko> Will we be granted EYES ON THE INSIDE
[3:40:49] <$RubberFistFight> The only reason it seems like a temporal loop at ALL is because we're seeing it through the eyes of someone who essentially is remembering the future.
[3:40:50] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @MellowMute "Son of a bitch!!"
[3:40:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> They eye says "42"
[3:40:53] <Alphaetus_Prime> wait can you actually do it this way
[3:40:57] <%Frost_Quill> I'm gonna laugh is the signal is just 'Yo don't come here, this place is gonna be FUCKED someday."
[3:41:03] <silverira> stop doing unintended shit
[3:41:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeyeye
[3:41:08] <%TaifuDragon> You can't
[3:41:11] <aimlesshealer> Switch to auxiliary fart power
[3:41:12] <OldOnyx> When fully decoded the signal from the eye starts "Hi, Phil Swift here"

[3:41:29] <DRAGKUDO> @dedlokpm They said nothing about it being bad or that stream sucked. Judging them having a badge i would assume they are fans of Pat. and despite it being a dull game they'll still watch it for Pat's experience. Anyway this doesn't matter it just seems even more dumb to snap back at people who aren't being extremely rude.

[3:43:20] <%DedlokPM> @DRAGKUDO Saying that something is dull is pretty much saying it is bad and not fitting to their level of enjoyment. And it is rude to the person playing it for others and is clearly enjoying it. It adds nothing to the overall conversation too. Just detracts from it.
[3:43:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wew
[3:43:21] <danknugglit> LUL
[3:43:21] <%GarbageQueenEllie> you did it
[3:43:22] <Broooomy> @Dakuu75 its playing fast and loose with the physics of how this solar system would work
[3:43:25] <%demegodz> Nailed it
[3:43:26] <Louie_Salmon> @dakuu75 This is Mario Galaxy where everything is on a very small scale and none of the physics have to make sense
[3:43:28] <%Frost_Quill> It's near the north pole, right?

[3:43:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> good enough. story of my life
[3:43:53] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @Dakuu75 really tiny universe causes some weird shit. Small distances, tiny atmosphere's, weird evolution of life. Pat is some weird frog person or somethin
[3:44:17] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Youwereeatenbyalid We dont know if wormholes actually are a thing. They are supported by theory of Relativity and can be mathematically explored in the Einstein field equations thru special math, but basically
[3:44:20] <Hawkbone_> @Youwereeatenbyalid Yeah but what is he in the game Kappa
[3:44:22] <$RubberFistFight> @DedlokPM the best part is one person's "dull" is another person's "exciting". I really, really like games that hit on the themes in this one, and watching Pat bumble his way around the mystery is great.
[3:44:23] <+Forente> oh shit see you in the vod
[3:44:25] <Nina96> i haven't been paying attention at all can someone summarize whats happening?
[3:44:27] <+Griffin1171> raise it
[3:44:30] <Tisaric> It's not necessarily tiny universe causing these weird things, but it could be
[3:44:34] <$ZE_Count> pat look up
[3:44:35] <BaronVonWidget> same thing
[3:44:36] <%Deadpal> dat music
[3:44:39] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @Hawkbone_ identical to a human presumably Kappa
[3:44:41] <Alphaetus_Prime> @Nina96 hahahahaha no
[3:44:42] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Youwereeatenbyalid Wormholes are mostly Scifiction hahaha
[3:44:44] <Hawkbone_> @Nina96 No. That would take too long.
[3:44:46] <Tisaric> what does that look like?
[3:44:47] <dekkitout> Bop it?
[3:44:48] <$ZE_Count> think about it
[3:44:49] <+jcenderion> Warp pad!
[3:44:52] <%Reveresao> depends on your perspective
[3:44:54] <Smart_ZaK1> Twist it
[3:44:54] <$Dakuu75> twist it
[3:44:56] <%Frost_Quill> Oh shit.
[3:44:56] <Alphaetus_Prime> 🤔
[3:44:57] <faegbeard> havin' a BIG THINK
[3:44:57] <Nina96> @Alphaetus_Prime :(
[3:44:59] <%crimsonharvest> is that the bottom fo the warp pad? can you just fly in the hole and warp back?
[3:44:59] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Nina96 Majora's Mask, aliens
[3:45:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Twist it!
[3:45:04] <+Shaggnar> YES rooVV
[3:45:05] <%arcaderabbit48> Bop it!
[3:45:06] <$MachoMadnesss94> @XeroSigmaPrime yeah but a lot of that more complex physics stuff hasn'
[3:45:06] <danknugglit> How can this be
[3:45:07] <%TaifuDragon> here we go agai
[3:45:08] <%TaifuDragon> n
[3:45:11] <Smart_ZaK1> Squeeze it
[3:45:15] <glaciusinfinite> recognize that design pat ?
[3:45:15] <Tisaric> man the soundtrack is so good
[3:45:16] <Alphaetus_Prime> @Nina96 way too much shit going on for a twitch chat summary to work
[3:45:18] <Xelhesia> spin it
[3:45:19] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat your signal scope can zoom
[3:45:23] <%Frost_Quill> @Sphincter_Spelunker Those were based on the Flatwoods Monster.
[3:45:24] <%keye90> bang it Kreygasm
[3:45:29] <Hawkbone_> What the fuck
[3:45:31] <Alphaetus_Prime> 🤔
[3:45:31] <$ZE_Count> have a big think
[3:45:31] <osiris1260> @hawkbone_ A weird blue amphibious man-thing. Kinda cute tho
[3:45:32] <Tisaric> so maybe you warp there then?
[3:45:36] <aimlesshealer> Oh man, there are kids in here who don't know what a Bop It is
[3:45:41] <danknugglit> Dig up stupid
[3:45:42] <+jcenderion> You gotta find the one that takes you there
[3:45:42] <faegbeard> got a big think coming on
[3:45:43] <Louie_Salmon> @dragkudo I hadn't seen their name in chat before, so it seemed like they just popped in, saw 5 seconds of him reading something, and went "this looks boring". So since it wasn't even a fully formed opinion, insulting it shouldn't be a big deal
[3:45:43] <glaciusinfinite> Fire that synapse
[3:45:44] <Nina96> @Sphincter_Spelunker not that whats pat trying to do right now?
[3:45:44] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @XeroSigmaPrime I'm aware they're only theoretical, but isn't the theory behind them use similar logic for black holes? Sorry if I'm bothering you BTW I can go wiki this stuff
[3:45:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> imagine the hadies song from ff14 here
[3:45:46] <Hawkbone_> What the fuck could possibly warp you there?!
[3:45:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> BOP IT
[3:45:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> NO
[3:45:52] <$ZE_Count> think harder and look at it
[3:45:52] <mankeyfigh> NOO
[3:45:56] <+Shaggnar> There's some gravity bullshit floors there
[3:45:58] <Smart_ZaK1> No
[3:45:59] <+Griffin1171> black hole warps you to the surface
[3:46:00] <danknugglit> You gotta dig up pat
[3:46:00] <+jcenderion> No the white hole is paired to a different one
[3:46:02] <Tisaric> OH I GET THE SYMBOL NOW
[3:46:02] <%crimsonharvest> or can you get there from the top side?
[3:46:04] <%TaifuDragon> The solution is probably elsewhere
[3:46:04] <$MachoMadnesss94> @XeroSigmaPrime *hasn't progressed in decades and we still don't know
[3:46:10] <Alphaetus_Prime> let him figure it out holy shit
[3:46:12] <%DedlokPM> @RubberFistFight Indeed. Like I said earlier. If he was not enjoying it all he had to do was leave. Instead he declared something unneeded and rude.
[3:46:13] <$ZE_Count> Design
[3:46:13] <Tisaric> I never picked that up
[3:46:14] <garbageheaphound> fall up?
[3:46:16] <Hawkbone_> The black hole warp only brings you to planets
[3:46:20] <danknugglit> Dig up
[3:46:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Nina96 oh, the whole stream has been this one planet. just stumbling around I guess
[3:46:24] <%QuadraticGravity> @DedlokPM dude holy shit is this conversation really worth it
[3:46:24] <$Dakuu75> "fall up" lmao
[3:46:33] <Nina96> @Sphincter_Spelunker thx
[3:46:33] <%Reveresao> he lacks critical information chat
[3:46:37] <%PinkSuprende> Dig up stupid
[3:46:39] <%keye90> let him do it...
[3:46:43] <Alphaetus_Prime> try and see
[3:46:48] <Youwereeatenbyalid> See, the rad thing is you could technically gravity slingshot to get up there.
[3:46:51] <+Shaggnar> Only one way to find out
[3:46:53] <$ZE_Count> explore other planets is my advice
[3:46:56] <%crimsonharvest> boost hard at it and find out?
[3:46:57] <osiris1260> Warp stations work between planets. I won’t tell you which though
[3:47:03] <Tisaric> You kind of just need to know that that warp pad is how you get to the forge
[3:47:09] <%brave_sj> You require further exploration of the solar system @AngriestPat
[3:47:14] <$RubberFistFight> @DedlokPM Chat is apparently in a very bad mood today. Everything is a spoiler and everything sucks, allegedly.
[3:47:20] <+Griffin1171> visit other planets
[3:47:20] <$Dakuu75> silent-but-deadly, ghost farts
[3:47:21] <Hawkbone_> Shhhhh
[3:47:31] <Hawkbone_> Let him figure it out
[3:47:34] <glaciusinfinite> WARP is UP ???? is DOWN?
[3:47:38] <Alphaetus_Prime> yes, new information about the game is a spoiler
[3:47:41] <%wujak> it might be easier to follow breadcrumbs to other planets instead of trying to 100% each one at a time
[3:47:42] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I'm hungry, but you don't see me bitching cause of it
[3:47:45] <Alphaetus_Prime> I don't know why that surprises some people
[3:47:46] <$ZE_Count> theres a cool liabry here
[3:47:52] <%Niney_Who> "Will pat suffer another fatal bone-fracture or will he fall into the black hole?"
[3:48:02] <+jcenderion> You can't do much else here for now
[3:48:08] <Louie_Salmon> @niney_who Or somehow both, like that one time
[3:48:09] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @RubberFistFight comes from a lot of people not playing the game and taking a "better safe than sorry" approach. Expecially given the games focus
[3:48:11] <glaciusinfinite> Should BABA be DOWN too?
[3:48:15] <Hawkbone_> Whats Pats black hole count at? 6, 7?
[3:48:16] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @GarbageQueenEllie Hi hungry,
[3:48:23] <%kiiiirsten> I got new contact lenses today after like 6 months of not wearing any and now I can't get one out so RIP me
[3:48:30] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Youwereeatenbyalid Oh no, this is so fine. To answer your question.... yes and no hahaha. They both rely heavily on our understanding of relativity. But they are two completely different things.
[3:48:36] <$ZE_Count> go back
[3:48:41] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Sphincter_Spelunker Why did you name me this way?
[3:48:42] <$RubberFistFight> @Youwereeatenbyalid exactly. The problem is, with that approach, everything IS a spoiler, even if it's actually not.
[3:48:45] <osiris1260> You can almost never complete a planet without taking trips to the other ones first, just kinda go with the flow
[3:48:45] <Alphaetus_Prime> wow hold up I'm not sure I ever found that one
[3:48:49] <Tisaric> how they use the base mechanics of pictures and signals is really cool
[3:48:54] <Jack_DT> Pat is mat
[3:49:06] <$ZE_Count> nice
[3:49:09] <+jcenderion> Oh no a school
[3:49:11] <+Verd_254> what is the purpose of taking the photos i just got here
[3:49:12] <aimlesshealer> This song reminds me of the OG Minecraft soundtrack
[3:49:24] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat well you found it just now, so everything worked out better than expected :P
[3:49:27] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @XeroSigmaPrime ah, so science fiction did lie to me at some point. I assume white holes are more or less fictional then?
[3:49:29] <$Dakuu75> space, comic-con
[3:49:31] <%QuadraticGravity> Oh the children handwriting is awful that's awesome
[3:49:34] <bubbledude11> what a bunch of fuckin nerds
[3:49:34] <+Estuko> recently started playing that horizon chase game, hella fun
[3:49:43] <%dalmek> notice the messy spirals are by children @angriestpat
[3:49:46] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Nice detail with that handwriting
[3:49:46] <dekkitout> What's up with this chicken scratch? Is it Nomai Esperanto?
[3:49:47] <+Griffin1171> the language is more scribbly
[3:49:47] <Tennochief> Is out festival our terrible memes?
[3:49:49] <Hawkbone_> All the little details are awesome
[3:49:50] <$RubberFistFight> @Youwereeatenbyalid white holes are hypothesized, but no evidence has been found yet.
[3:49:57] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lewd
[3:49:59] <eco419> PogChamp
[3:50:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> thicc
[3:50:04] <Alphaetus_Prime> oh hey it's solanum
[3:50:04] <+Griffin1171> just like me
[3:50:07] <Darkrenai> Our whole universe was in a hot dense state
[3:50:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hawt
[3:50:09] <Broooomy> @dekkitout its supposed to be sloppy children writing
[3:50:12] <Hawkbone_> Oh shit, this was babby Solamum, the guy that died on the quantum moon!
[3:50:14] <shevan123> i would love to play this game if it wasnt on the epic store
[3:50:15] <%demegodz> hot a heavy
[3:50:16] <+Verd_254> you know pat is into it when he doesn't skim dialog
[3:50:18] <eco419> lewd
[3:50:20] <Jack_DT> god I'm cute
[3:50:21] <%crimsonharvest> in case anyone wants more big bang facts, look at UpIsNotJump's video about it
[3:50:24] <$MachoMadnesss94> super hot
[3:50:28] <Marpolo13> sucks to be them
[3:50:28] <Smart_ZaK1> I can't wait to get colder and larger
[3:50:28] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I wonder. does the direction of the spirals depend on which is your dominant hand?
[3:50:29] <$RubberFistFight> @dekkitout I love their writing style. Sentences branch out organically like they do in conversations.
[3:50:30] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @kiiiirsten look around a bunch to try and loosen it, alternate between a dry and a wet hand
[3:50:32] <+jcenderion> Dead alien babies
[3:50:33] <+MisterCrimson> What else is hot and dense?
[3:50:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> Hot and dense, like Paige sipsipSipsipblind
[3:50:41] <dekkitout> Well, I guess even wee Nomai children can understand Fibonacci spirals
[3:50:43] <sileo_patronus> This kid SOLANUM thinks too much
[3:50:45] <Endocrom> Heat death of the universe kids!
[3:50:48] <Tisaric> the conversation method is really smart design
[3:50:50] <+timblenaut> crazy text!
[3:50:52] <aimlesshealer> @GeneralSCPatton I wasn't gonna say it, it was too mean LUL
[3:50:53] <laguerrilha> it will separete so much it will be the same ass all planets being alone
[3:51:01] <Louie_Salmon> That was like, a 30 second crash course on how heat death is scary, nice
[3:51:02] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Youwereeatenbyalid Yea, a white hole is wayyy more fictional hahah.
[3:51:09] <Zombrocom> Oh. Nomai. Nomad. I just got that.
[3:51:10] <Tisaric> Especially with how one thread can have multiple replies
[3:51:12] <%kiiiirsten> @Sphincter_Spelunker I used your patented sphincter spelunking techniques and it worked, thank you LUL
[3:51:15] <eco419> BrokeBack
[3:51:33] <%Deadpal> All those deaad nomai kids :(
[3:51:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @kiiiirsten lost a contact once, in my eyelid. you learn things
[3:51:38] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Youwereeatenbyalid But thats not to say something that could be described as similar to white holes or "White space" exists
[3:51:42] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Heroic
[3:51:42] <Endocrom> Liberal anti eye of the universe schools!
[3:51:42] <$RubberFistFight> @kiiiirsten there is a tutorial on easily removing them I found on youtube, coz i struggle as well. Let me find it for you.
[3:51:42] <Zalthia> This is neat
[3:51:44] <$Dakuu75> I can't believe he didn't fuck that up
[3:51:45] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @XeroSigmaPrime oh geeze, I just took a look at Schwarzschild wormholes and now my head hurts
[3:51:46] <eco419> dead kids D:
[3:51:50] <MartyFun11> I like how nomai kids writing looks worse than adult writing
[3:51:55] <$ZE_Count> Yeah whatever killed them all was was fast
[3:51:59] <aimlesshealer> I want to see Plague's interpretation of a Nomai
[3:51:59] <%MonsieurHedge> F?
[3:52:02] <%crimsonharvest> do you have a sprint or is this sprinting
[3:52:03] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Youwereeatenbyalid yea.... Its whole lot of maybe and possibly but we really dont know hahaha
[3:52:09] <Alphaetus_Prime> yeah the kids' writing being all messy is great
[3:52:12] <Hawkbone_> @crimsonharvest No to both
[3:52:20] <$ZE_Count> Look at it
[3:52:20] <%crimsonharvest> the probe stayed pat j
[3:52:26] <Tisaric> They gave such a good amount of character to these otherwise pretty lifeless planets
[3:52:26] <Koosahmii> Not gonna talk about all those dead kids at their desks, huh?
[3:52:26] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @XeroSigmaPrime universe is confusing. But really cool!
[3:52:30] <%Reveresao> @angriestpat remember Independence day
[3:52:31] <$ZE_Count> The design
[3:52:38] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Youwereeatenbyalid Sci-fi usually takes these ideas and acts as if they actually are real, which is cool... but also nearly always fictional hahaha
[3:52:41] <%waltzqueen> this music is all so good
[3:52:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> Nomi are just vulkins really
[3:52:48] <%kiiiirsten> @Sphincter_Spelunker I went to sleep drunk with one in once and never saw it again (pun intended)?...I was convinced it lived somewhere in my brain until my appointment today LUL
[3:52:49] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Koosahmii Looks like their Summer Vacation is OVER. (CSI Miami theme)
[3:52:50] <Tisaric> you need more information
[3:52:53] <eco419> That piano Kreygasm
[3:52:57] <%Frost_Quill> Oh that's it.
[3:52:59] <Darkrenai> Ouch
[3:52:59] <faegbeard> BIG THINK
[3:53:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pff
[3:53:03] <+Shaggnar> LUL
[3:53:03] <Alphaetus_Prime> good effort LUL
[3:53:06] <corepool> F
[3:53:07] <shevan123> oh
[3:53:07] <hntronium> I wonder, does it eventually get eaten by a black hole too
[3:53:08] <dekkitout> tajPF
[3:53:08] <eco419> LUL
[3:53:09] <aimlesshealer> Yes!
[3:53:09] <%sporeian94> NICE JOB PAT
[3:53:12] <%arcaderabbit48> Oh yay. Back here. Again
[3:53:13] <$Dakuu75> I kinda thought that would work
[3:53:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> You need the Invert Shard
[3:53:15] <Xelhesia> F
[3:53:15] <danknugglit> Brute smarts
[3:53:15] <BinaryBetrayer> How can this be.
[3:53:16] <%BioApple> cool
[3:53:16] <silverira> SPAAAAAAAAAAAACE
[3:53:18] <Tennochief> you know what this means
[3:53:18] <%Yadogari> The thing
[3:53:19] <%TaifuDragon> Y E T
[3:53:19] <jcflyguy> Pat really has a thing for huge gaping holes.
[3:53:20] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat gravity floors
[3:53:21] <Tisaric> @AngriestPat you need more information
[3:53:22] <+jcenderion> Come back later
[3:53:23] <dekkitout> Hello darkness my old friend
[3:53:23] <aimlesshealer> "I don't understand..." *THUNK*
[3:53:23] <%Reveresao> time to explore other planets then
[3:53:26] <Alphaetus_Prime> that's correct, you have no idea
[3:53:28] <Endocrom> The sun explodes before the whole thing gets consumed
[3:53:29] <MyNameIsRasus> thats fine
[3:53:29] <%juxtest> Now just chill out here till your ship falls in
[3:53:29] <sileo_patronus> it's fine, you can do something else
[3:53:29] <BinaryBetrayer> explore someplace else in the meanwhie.
[3:53:30] <$ZE_Count> you got to explore all the planets pat
[3:53:30] <%QuadraticGravity> You ran into something similar on other planets
[3:53:30] <%crimsonharvest> go find the other planets then theres a ton of shit still
[3:53:32] <Hawkbone_> @GeneralSCPatton Shhhhh
[3:53:32] <caliento> maybe on another planet?
[3:53:33] <+Griffin1171> it involves other planets
[3:53:33] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @MachoMadnesss94 Sorry for he wait on your comment but actually. We've progressed A HUGE DEAL in everything space and time related hahah
[3:53:34] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Go look elsewhere then
[3:53:34] <+Despera__> You need more info elsewhere
[3:53:36] <hntronium> Need timestop?
[3:53:37] <PKLoveLucas> which means you can't do it yet
[3:53:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> "I am so intimidated by this big, gaping hole"
[3:53:38] <%RupanSen> you need time stop
[3:53:39] <%Frost_Quill> That means it's time to explore other planets to learn more.
[3:53:42] <%TaifuDragon> You need timestop
[3:53:42] <%wujak> @AngriestPat maybe its time to checkout another planet, then come back with more info
[3:53:43] <$MachoMadnesss94> @Youwereeatenbyalid go look at gauge symmetry and planet hopf if you want your head to really hurt. principle fiber bundles man...
[3:53:43] <+jcenderion> Remember it's there and come back later
[3:53:46] <zedravan> time stop
[3:53:47] <$ZE_Count> yeah you did
[3:53:48] <Louie_Salmon> Needs timestop
[3:53:51] <eco419> PAT THE LOCKER
[3:53:51] <MyNameIsRasus> you need TIME STOP
[3:53:53] <Alphaetus_Prime> he didn't
[3:53:53] <+Shaggnar> Clearly you need timestop
[3:53:56] <glaciusinfinite> shush
[3:53:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> Need timestop
[3:53:57] <%crimsonharvest> you got hung up on progress elsewhere
[3:53:59] <Alphaetus_Prime> it was the same planet
[3:53:59] <$ZE_Count> they all had pads
[3:54:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the timestop locker
[3:54:03] <Smart_ZaK1> Just let him figure it out
[3:54:04] <OldOnyx> needs timestop
[3:54:04] <aimlesshealer> Use timestop to get inside the locker
[3:54:05] <%BioApple> looking at chat for answers is a big dsp move
[3:54:08] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you teleported, remember?
[3:54:16] <%PanicSwytch> The Lid
[3:54:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat sold ratslayrt
[3:54:18] <PKLoveLucas> all of the puzzles in this game are knowledge based, so if you don't know how to do it then you can't do it yet
[3:54:21] <Alphaetus_Prime> he'll figure it out in about 30 seconds
[3:54:24] <%Reveresao> ³33333333
[3:54:24] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @MachoMadnesss94 Its just kinda so far out there and hard to understand that most people who dont go to college specifically researching this stuff wont ever really learn anything significant
[3:54:24] <+drwhofan999> i highly recommend to keep exploring the other planets
[3:54:33] <$Dakuu75> Man, space is bull shit.
[3:54:35] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @BioApple streaming a video of the end of the game is the big dsp move
[3:54:37] <@lewdskeletor13> How can this be
[3:54:39] <$RubberFistFight> there's more than one teleporter
[3:54:41] <$ZE_Count> yeah so that pad has one that matches it
[3:54:45] <osiris1260> Timber hearth has something similar, you checked it out in the first stream
[3:54:45] <+jcenderion> So you have to find another teleporter
[3:54:45] <Monkeyweed21> did pat reach the observatory?
[3:54:53] <Hawkbone_> @ZE_Count He knows its a warp pad, he's saying he hasn't found an upside down thing like that.
[3:54:58] <eco419> LUL
[3:55:03] <%QuadraticGravity> @Monkeyweed21 No, he got distracted by the hanging city
[3:55:03] <Tisaric> You do need to teleport to it, but this one is only lined up with the surface
[3:55:05] <+Griffin1171> there's other planets
[3:55:11] <danknugglit> Screaming with letters
[3:55:11] <+Mr_Pylon> warp pad, you've seen a couple
[3:55:11] <absolute_cagemony> But if BABA....
[3:55:14] <Alphaetus_Prime> just chill and explore
[3:55:19] <$ZE_Count> look at pad your on
[3:55:20] <%dalmek> when in doubt, go elsewhere
[3:55:26] <osiris1260> You haven’t been to enough planets
[3:55:26] <Junkles> pat how do you not know the thing you haven't discovered yet pieHELLO
[3:55:27] <+drwhofan999> @Monkeyweed21 no not on hollow
[3:55:28] <mankeyfigh> @AngriestPat YOU NEED A teleporter on another PLANET
[3:55:34] <%TaifuDragon> WAIT WHAT
[3:55:34] <Alphaetus_Prime> he had the same reaction last stream LUL
[3:55:36] <Youwereeatenbyalid> NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE
[3:55:37] <+Shaggnar> Brain is clicking
[3:55:39] <BaronVonWidget> SHOOSH
[3:55:40] <%Reveresao> @angriestpat only after you activated it from a black station
[3:55:42] <sileo_patronus> man people getting mad
[3:55:42] <%Frost_Quill> Holy fuck chat just let him explore other planets.
[3:55:44] <Tisaric> yeah the warp pads can go back
[3:55:45] <danknugglit> LUL
[3:55:48] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You should go sploring on other planets
[3:55:48] <%crimsonharvest> these are like they only connect 2 specific points maybe?
[3:55:48] <%QuadraticGravity> You did this last stream LUL
[3:55:48] <eco419> dejavu pat
[3:55:51] <%TaifuDragon> fascinating
[3:55:51] <Endocrom> Fuck it, go see if there's anything on that comet. Unless you already did in those 2 hours i missed.
[3:55:52] <Smart_ZaK1> Hoes mad
[3:55:59] <sileo_patronus> hoes mad
[3:56:03] <Tisaric> The comet is so fucking cool
[3:56:04] <glaciusinfinite> But BABA NotLikeThis
[3:56:05] <mankeyfigh> tleporter is on other planet
[3:56:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Endocrom Yeah, I wanna see what's on that comet!
[3:56:13] <Monkeyweed21> if only there was a planet with other warp pads
[3:56:17] <+jcenderion> Thats on the SOUTH pole
[3:56:22] <$MachoMadnesss94> @XeroSigmaPrime was listening to a podcast about that exact thought, there's so much crazy stuff in advances physics that the normal person will never know about. Some of the biggest mysteries of all time and almost nobody knows about them, let alone understands them
[3:56:22] <$ZE_Count> heal yoruself
[3:56:24] <eco419> Baba is lost uwu
[3:56:31] <danknugglit> Backseat harder chat LUL
[3:56:40] <osiris1260> If your stuck, I’d recommend checking your computer to follow some more plot threads you’ve uncovered
[3:56:43] <$ZE_Count> Go to banjo
[3:56:45] <Alphaetus_Prime> shut the fuck up chat he hasn't seen everything yet
[3:56:47] <+jpivot> what did i miss today
[3:56:51] <Alphaetus_Prime> my god why is this so hard
[3:56:57] <Monkeyweed21> you already found it
[3:57:02] <$RubberFistFight> @danknugglit he literally said "I don't know what to do, guys" and then LOOKED AT CHAT. I mean there's gotta be a line somewhere.
[3:57:08] <Alphaetus_Prime> no he did not find it
[3:57:09] <+Griffin1171> hey quantum moon
[3:57:28] <%kiiiirsten> Obligatory "Is this Anor Londo?"
[3:57:31] <PKLoveLucas> the escape pod only leads to the city
[3:57:45] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @MachoMadnesss94 Yea sorta. Its sorta like this: Shits complicated and hard to figure out. But as we connect the dots and figure it out, the easier it gets.
[3:57:46] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> no, this is new londo water park
[3:57:46] <$ZE_Count> go to banjo
[3:57:58] <%Frost_Quill> I think it says how in your ship.
[3:58:01] <mankeyfigh> STAIRS ON NTOWER
[3:58:01] <+Griffin1171> you need to go to the tower stairs to reach the crossroads
[3:58:02] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @ZE_Count he already went though
[3:58:05] <sileo_patronus> @Monkeyweed21 are you just guessing at what he already knows?

[3:58:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> deep breaths
[3:58:09] <%crimsonharvest> its ok Pat youre fine
[3:58:11] <%PanicSwytch> Is this anor londo
[3:58:13] <DagetStreams> PAHZOOLS
[3:58:16] <$ZE_Count> Thats where the crossroads are
[3:58:17] <PKLoveLucas> there's a map near where riebeck is
[3:58:19] <aimlesshealer> Don't worry about it

[3:58:29] <+jpivot> @AngriestPat if you go to your shiplog and look at certain entries, you can mark waypoints on your HUD. try it!
[3:58:31] <Smart_ZaK1> Anor londo was the friends we made along the way
[3:58:34] <%Niney_Who> Just think up, stupid
[3:58:43] <$sl8r4l8r> cheer200 Pet Elmo
[3:58:43] <%TaifuDragon> The WHOLE GAME is information
[3:58:44] <$ZE_Count> Explore more planets is the answer I guess
[3:58:45] <danknugglit> Just do what you want theres lots to discover
[3:58:46] <%wujak> @AngriestPat a lot of the info you need comes from hopping between planets. its kinda nuts youve played for about 5 hours and only seen half the planets
[3:58:46] <osiris1260> Check the computer for places to go
[3:58:47] <Tisaric> We've been trying to tell you you need more info
[3:58:48] <Louie_Salmon> We should really just have a safeword for spoilers, like you say "Banana bread" and then we know you're not being retorical
[3:58:50] <+Griffin1171> check map mode
[3:58:54] <%Niney_Who> LUL
[3:58:55] <MyNameIsRasus> you need brain timestop
[3:58:55] <StingtheKing> Just do it. 4Head
[3:58:56] <%PanicSwytch> Git Gud
[3:58:56] <%kiiiirsten> I can never think ever so I feel that
[3:59:00] <thunderborn32> @AngriestPat you already have all the tools to solve it, its not that you can't do it
[3:59:04] <%dalmek> @angriestpat remember that in the ship's logs you can press y for map mode
[3:59:05] <%TaifuDragon> You can go anywhere and just DO IT from the very start of the game, so saying anything is pretty consequential
[3:59:06] <$MachoMadnesss94> @XeroSigmaPrime yeah seems that way, I don't understand it. I didn't study it I just find it interesting to read about
[3:59:07] <aimlesshealer> Be brain more

[3:59:16] <PKLoveLucas> riebeck's camp?
[3:59:18] <dekkitout> Have you tried setting gravity to 'Wombo'
[3:59:18] <Alphaetus_Prime> @thunderborn32 why the fuck would you tell him that what is wrong with you
[3:59:20] <%BioApple> the thing with puzzles is that telling you what you're missing is the same as spoiling the puzzle so there's no recourse other than "AAAHJHH FDFSDF"
[3:59:20] <%Niney_Who> 3
[3:59:20] <Tisaric> You have all the tools, but not all the info
[3:59:23] <mankeyfigh> NO HE DOESNT
[3:59:24] <%Reveresao> 3
[3:59:25] <MyNameIsRasus> he doesnt
[3:59:26] <$RubberFistFight> @Louie_Salmon that would work really well, actually. People would still freak the fuck out about "spoilers" though.
[3:59:26] <Youwereeatenbyalid> FUCK
[3:59:26] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> 3
[3:59:26] <PKLoveLucas> also no he doesn't

[3:59:30] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@sileo_patronus) (warning)
[3:59:30] <%Frost_Quill> You CAN solve it if you know how, you need to learn how to do it is all.
[3:59:31] <Alphaetus_Prime> ONE GUY

[3:59:42] <danknugglit> Pat needs to learn first LUL
[3:59:42] <%Frost_Quill> That's what all these puzzles are.
[3:59:45] <eco419> LUL
[3:59:45] <%juxtest> Just ram your ship into things until you win the game
[3:59:46] <$ZE_Count> go to camp
[3:59:47] <Endocrom> See what else is out there. Me personally I want to see the comet.
[3:59:49] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @Tisaric why you gotta be that way
[3:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> pat you need to explore more places
[3:59:50] <PKLoveLucas> if you don't know how to do it, then you can't
[3:59:55] <%crimsonharvest> how about some of those bodies we ahven't been to eh?
[3:59:58] <Monkeyweed21> you need to find the coresponding black pad
[4:00:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> pat, you no go to evo?
[4:00:03] <%Niney_Who> Just use Spiral Energy, Pat
[4:00:08] <bashful_bard> !uptime
[4:00:08] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 10s.
[4:00:17] <+Tokanova> i think hydration bot wants us hydrated so it can juice us when the robot rebellion comes
[4:00:21] <%QuadraticGravity> the hallwugging will be your demise
[4:00:22] <EuropantLamprey> Crazy Talk: Requium Act 2: Pat reads advice from the one guy in chat who is giving bad advice and ignroes the 10 guys saying he's wrong
[4:00:24] <DagetStreams> Gravy Cannon
[4:00:28] <$MachoMadnesss94> time to HYDRATE y'all
[4:00:30] <Monkeyweed21> GOTY PAT
[4:00:31] <zedravan> what happen to that seed of evil that duped your scout?
[4:00:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> pats hall wugging strat is making it so he can't make progress
[4:00:34] <$ZE_Count> Explore more planets
[4:00:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @MachoMadnesss94 Yea, its like how finding the force of gravity felt on a planet of a specific mass and radius was impossible for someone to do 100 years ago, but now a 10 year oldcan easily look at an equation now, understand it and do it
[4:00:35] <%Niney_Who> G O T Y LUL
[4:00:37] <eco419> LUL
[4:00:37] <glaciusinfinite> increas brainpower
[4:00:38] <%Frost_Quill> You made lots of progress.
[4:00:38] <Alphaetus_Prime> @AngriestPat stop looking at chat, like for real
[4:00:39] <%TaifuDragon> Still highly recommend exploring different planets
[4:00:41] <+Griffin1171> you made a lot of progress
[4:00:45] <BinaryBetrayer> Pat, Learning is Progress.
[4:00:45] <%BioApple> that's FINE for this game, do it at your own pace @AngriestPat
[4:00:47] <%TaifuDragon> but yeah you made a ton
[4:00:47] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @AngriestPat you don't have all the tools, go look elsewhere. Also you made a ton of progress
[4:00:47] <Hawkbone_> You've found and explored the hanging city, thats progress
[4:00:48] <+Estuko> Space space space space space...
[4:00:50] <BinaryBetrayer> You{ve learned a lot.
[4:00:52] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> You can land in the Cannon
[4:00:53] <sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat anything added to the log is progress it's fine
[4:00:53] <glaciusinfinite> that's not true
[4:00:55] <mankeyfigh> STAIRS
[4:00:57] <%Gray_skies1993> you learned, which is BIG progress
[4:01:00] <%ColonelRozum> wow pat actually slowed down for once?
[4:01:01] <$ZE_Count> =you already did all this
[4:01:02] <+jpivot> oh what is he trying to do here?
[4:01:03] <+geminitengu> @AngriestPat ignore chat and enjoy yourself
[4:01:06] <%wujak> please check out other planets. you are close to 10 hours in and only seen half of them. its almost impossible to finish discovering the planets as self contained things
[4:01:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> how about we sing the Doom song
[4:01:28] <eco419> CREEPER
[4:01:30] <Hawkbone_> Why did you land on the literal entire other side of the planet from the thing you're going to?
[4:01:36] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @MachoMadnesss94 Someday, we might have simple easy equations to be like "oh this is the amount of force you feel in this big of a black hole when youre this deep inside of it"
[4:01:36] <+Griffin1171> read signs
[4:01:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Sphincter_Spelunker RIP AND TEAR!
[4:01:39] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat honestly when I was at this point I sat back and slowed down and read through the notes a bit. It helps to focus on one goal at a time, and maybe write down things you've seen/done so that you don't wind up repeating. You've made a TON of progress though, since progress isn't put together in this game the way it is in others. It's about how much you learn - and you've learned like, 2 rules and found a whole bunch of breadcrumbs.
[4:01:41] <Alphaetus_Prime> let him figure out what he needs to do oh my god
[4:01:42] <danknugglit> Maybe you should explore another planet if youre feeling like youve hit a wall
[4:01:44] <Louie_Salmon> Take my advice, a chatsman, and ignore chat
[4:01:44] <%frankthetank285> u know what pat after watching run around in circles all night accomplishing nothing i agree this game is better than dmc 5
[4:01:54] <osiris1260> I’m just gonna say it, you NEED to see some other planets at this point
[4:01:56] <eco419> LUL LUL LUL
[4:01:57] <+Estuko> monkaS
[4:01:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @doc_ock_rokc wrong doom song. but I'll allow it
[4:01:59] <$ZE_Count> you can slingshot around the blackhole
[4:02:01] <%QuadraticGravity> close chat tbh
[4:02:05] <$ZE_Count> kinda hard tho
[4:02:07] <Alphaetus_Prime> meditate while falling into a black hole lmao
[4:02:08] <sileo_patronus> that's a big 'I don't know'
[4:02:10] <%sporeian94> Pat cakm down and another game
[4:02:17] <$Dakuu75> @AngriestPat You seem stressed, dude. Just ignore chat and enjoy the game bro-ham.
[4:02:18] <+jpivot> this is why you dont get the meditate option at the beginning of the game...
[4:02:21] <Smart_ZaK1> It's fine
[4:02:27] <Alphaetus_Prime> ???
[4:02:29] <$ZE_Count> just land there
[4:02:31] <+poobus> Is this an epic store exclusive?
[4:02:33] <sileo_patronus> which area?
[4:02:33] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Again, you can land In the gravity cannon, no need to navigate
[4:02:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat you need timestop
[4:02:35] <%Broand> The cannon?
[4:02:36] <%Niney_Who> Just Fly there..
[4:02:37] <MyNameIsRasus> just land there
[4:02:37] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Just fly around and have fun my dude
[4:02:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @poobus yes
[4:02:39] <Monkeyweed21> just fly there stumbo
[4:02:39] <+jcenderion> It's visible from the surface pat
[4:02:40] <+TheSaintJohn> it's 90's adventure games all over again?
[4:02:40] <+Griffin1171> the gravitty cannon, it's visible on the surface
[4:02:42] <eco419> time stop
[4:02:44] <%Toast_Master_General> Pat I'd say table that for later because chat is being apatBig useless
[4:02:51] <%crimsonharvest> its on the outside of the planet pat
[4:02:59] <Monkeyweed21> its visible from the surface
[4:03:01] <Pixel_gee> Thats the north pole
[4:03:05] <%QuadraticGravity> Water pool near the escape pod, wasn't it?
[4:03:05] <+poobus> Gamestop

[4:03:08] <+jpivot> lmao
[4:03:11] <Pixel_gee> nvm
[4:03:12] <Alphaetus_Prime> okay yeah even I don't think that one counts as a spoiler
[4:03:14] <Tisaric> yes
[4:03:16] <%Deadpal> yeah
[4:03:18] <Monkeyweed21> 111111
[4:03:18] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> You can land in it
[4:03:19] <$RubberFistFight> Bearer seek seek lest.
[4:03:21] <Youwereeatenbyalid> wait, you can see it though.
[4:03:22] <eco419> duuh
[4:03:24] <%QuadraticGravity> @Alphaetus_Prime Considering he had ALREADY BEEN THERE, no.
[4:03:30] <%Niney_Who> 1
[4:03:30] <$ZE_Count> silly boy
[4:03:32] <%Deadpal> I'd sasy pat if you get frustrated try out one of the planets you haven't been to yet
[4:03:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Planets are round
[4:03:41] <eco419> we know
[4:03:44] <laguerrilha> this is fine :)
[4:03:46] <%Niney_Who> 4 H O U R S LUL
[4:03:51] <Alphaetus_Prime> I didn't realize that lmao
[4:03:51] <+Griffin1171> we didn't know that
[4:03:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> oops
[4:03:56] <+TheSaintJohn> dig up stumbo
[4:04:02] <$ZE_Count> should of said that
[4:04:10] <eco419> Big Stumbo
[4:04:10] <%QuadraticGravity> the south is the southern observatory
[4:04:27] <Smart_ZaK1> Don't we need to go the crossroads?
[4:04:32] <$MachoMadnesss94> @XeroSigmaPrime I just hope that one day Einsteins theories are expanded upon so that we understand the parts where it starts to break down. And hopefully one day we can break the speed of light, but that might be wishful thinking.
[4:04:38] <masterofthemash> yo I read that game title wrong and almost freaked lol
[4:04:41] <Alphaetus_Prime> UH OH
[4:04:43] <Smart_ZaK1> YOO
[4:04:45] <+Griffin1171> sizzle
[4:04:47] <eco419> yooo
[4:04:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> Oh yes

[4:04:51] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> YEET
[4:04:53] <aimlesshealer> Wow.
[4:04:55] <Alphaetus_Prime> nah it's fine
[4:04:56] <Tisaric> actually nothing I'm pretty sure
[4:04:58] <Monkeyweed21> funsies
[4:05:00] <%TaifuDragon> I'm pretty sure it's literally nothing
[4:05:03] <%BioApple> flavor shuttle
[4:05:03] <+jcenderion> There isn't one
[4:05:03] <Alphaetus_Prime> oh I think you broke it LUL
[4:05:04] <%QuadraticGravity> It's fried LUL
[4:05:08] <$MachoMadnesss94> just for funzies
[4:05:08] <Tisaric> it's just to worldbuild
[4:05:09] <%Niney_Who> BROKE IT LUL
[4:05:09] <Smart_ZaK1> You broke it
[4:05:11] <+jpivot> its just cool
[4:05:11] <sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat to show how they did it I guess
[4:05:12] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Oh my god.
[4:05:12] <MyNameIsRasus> no ship runs
[4:05:16] <CatmanIX> GOOD JOB, YOU BROK THE CANON
[4:05:17] <Endocrom> One and done
[4:05:18] <Jack_DT> This game is outer but I see no wilds
[4:05:18] <%TaifuDragon> And what did it say
[4:05:19] <%QuadraticGravity> You launched it into the moon
[4:05:20] <+Griffin1171> ship broke
[4:05:22] <Hawkbone_> It said the shuttle was at the moon
[4:05:22] <%NWR_James> reading time is over
[4:05:22] <+jcenderion> It just says where the shuttle is
[4:05:23] <eco419> oops
[4:05:24] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> you can Yeet your Ship out of the System
[4:05:25] <glaciusinfinite> pat broke it LUL
[4:05:25] <$MachoMadnesss94> some things mean things, some things don't
[4:05:25] <Monkeyweed21> that is travel log for shuttle
[4:05:26] <Tisaric> because the ship was on the moon
[4:05:27] <Alphaetus_Prime> it said the shuttle is at the quantum moon, which is no longer the case
[4:05:27] <%Deadpal> needs the ship back to read it I think?
[4:05:33] <%QuadraticGravity> The ship is DEAD
[4:05:35] <Oleai> Is this a place exploration game?
[4:05:38] <%DedlokPM> It was. It was the thing telling you where the shuttle was
[4:05:40] <Oleai> space*
[4:05:42] <laguerrilha> shuttle is there, so it doesnt need to work anymore
[4:05:42] <%dalmek> The ship is very much dead
[4:05:43] <Monkeyweed21> tells you where shuttle is
[4:05:43] <sileo_patronus> are you ok pat?
[4:05:48] <+ThatButler> one way launches shuttle, the other way recalls the shuttle
[4:05:49] <Hawkbone_> Those things aren't clocks, they're information disks!
[4:05:53] <Endocrom> I think that's to SHOW you the shuttle before you figure out how to land on the moon
[4:05:55] <Louie_Salmon> This is as stumbo as it gets
[4:05:55] <%Niney_Who> This is why paige is afraid of Space
[4:05:55] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> pet elmo, take a breather
[4:05:56] <+jpivot> it said "the ship is on the quantum moon". the ship is no longer on the quantum moon, so you cant read it
[4:05:58] <%DedlokPM> It doesn't need to tell you where the shuttle is because the shuttle is right here
[4:05:58] <%Niney_Who> Not for her own sake, but for Pat's
[4:05:59] <+Griffin1171> we don't know what you want
[4:06:01] <$cureneckbeard> !uptime
[4:06:01] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 6m.
[4:06:07] <Youwereeatenbyalid> I feel you pat, lot of shit going on
[4:06:15] <danknugglit> Relax and have fun pat :)
[4:06:17] <Alphaetus_Prime> PICK ONE QUICK
[4:06:17] <Tisaric> @Oleai yeah, small universe space exploration with a kind of story to follow
[4:06:23] <Youwereeatenbyalid> monkaS
[4:06:24] <%kiiiirsten> It's not the destination, it's the journey apatLiz
[4:06:25] <sileo_patronus> south observatory is a fucking dick in the ass to get to
[4:06:27] <$ZE_Count> wrong one I think
[4:06:30] <%DedlokPM> We portal, boys
[4:06:30] <eco419> LUL
[4:06:34] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @MachoMadnesss94 To answer the speed of light question, you cant. There are certain ways to kinda go "faster" than it but not really. That goes to some serious Quantum physics, thats above me now.
[4:06:35] <Tisaric> I don't think it matters which one
[4:06:35] <$ZE_Count> you figure it out
[4:06:36] <+Griffin1171> just go south
[4:06:39] <Oleai> So it's subnautica in space?
[4:06:42] <%arcaderabbit48> This game seems incredibly stressful. There's a remarkable number of moving parts to focus on, and it never feels clear when you have or have not hit a roadblock
[4:06:43] <%kiiiirsten> PUNISHED Pat
[4:06:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> How can this beee
[4:06:47] <%QuadraticGravity> JET
[4:06:49] <%Broand> oh boy wait for itr
[4:06:49] <%Reveresao> boost up
[4:06:55] <%MelBrooksKA> sipsipGears sipsipGears sipsipGears
[4:06:55] <Alphaetus_Prime> Jebaited
[4:06:57] <Tisaric> yeah space subnautica is pretty close
[4:06:59] <eco419> f
[4:07:00] <T_Sasquatch> @sileo_patronus sounds like fun
[4:07:02] <%QuadraticGravity> The reflexes of a sad goat
[4:07:02] <sileo_patronus> Why didn't you boost?
[4:07:03] <$ZE_Count> was almost thre
[4:07:03] <+jcenderion> Slingshot it!
[4:07:07] <+Griffin1171> great use of boost
[4:07:10] <+jcenderion> Or eat shit
[4:07:11] <Youwereeatenbyalid> SLINGSHOT!
[4:07:12] <osiris1260> Why?
[4:07:13] <silverira> HAHAHHA
[4:07:13] <+Despera__> use boost
[4:07:17] <aimlesshealer> YeeaaH!!!!
[4:07:17] <eco419> ouchie
[4:07:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> stumbo stumbs again
[4:07:18] <corepool> A for effort
[4:07:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[4:07:19] <%arcaderabbit48> Ande then this keeps happening!
[4:07:19] <danknugglit> So close
[4:07:20] <%ColonelRozum> again....
[4:07:21] <Monkeyweed21> stumbo down
[4:07:24] <@commanderclaw> Well, slingshotting *might* work
[4:07:24] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Good effort!
[4:07:29] <sileo_patronus> @T_Sasquatch not when you don't agree to it
[4:07:31] <CatmanIX> didn't even try tbh LUL
[4:07:31] <%docpepperphd> this happened to me a lot too
[4:07:37] <Alphaetus_Prime> D:
[4:07:39] <$MachoMadnesss94> @XeroSigmaPrime yes from what we know now, but quantum physics still has so many unsolved mysteries which we've made so little progress on
[4:07:41] <$ZE_Count> would you rathe rit killed you
[4:07:42] <californaya> I really don't like the movement in this game
[4:07:44] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @MachoMadnesss94 Nothing can physically move faster than light. But stuff can end up somewhere faster than light can... if that makes sense?
[4:07:44] <eco419> Ditto
[4:07:47] <Tisaric> slingshotting can work if you get good at the jet pack
[4:07:48] <Alphaetus_Prime> LUL
[4:07:49] <HeadsHeldHigh> gahahaha
[4:07:49] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Then leave
[4:07:50] <Hawkbone_> If it wasn't here you'd be fucked every time you fell in
[4:07:54] <%BioApple> @arcaderabbit48 depends on your mindset I guess. I can see why Pat's particular mind goblins would hurt his experience but I thought it was pretty relaxing outside of a few specfic challenges
[4:07:54] <%ColonelRozum> stop fallin in then LUL
[4:07:55] <Smart_ZaK1> PJSalt
[4:07:55] <laguerrilha> at least he tried to slingshot, did pretty well
[4:07:55] <Monkeyweed21> then stop eating shit stumbo
[4:07:58] <%docpepperphd> this is probably the most annoying part of the game, the rest is great I promise
[4:07:58] <HeadsHeldHigh> go to some other planet
[4:08:00] <+Despera__> Don't fall in then Kappa
[4:08:08] <Hawkbone_> Back in the alpha we didn't have an easily usable warp station!
[4:08:12] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Don't get hit Kappa
[4:08:13] <+jcenderion> It's better than flailing in space
[4:08:14] <danknugglit> You can go explore something else
[4:08:15] <corepool> chill at another planet then
[4:08:18] <%TrashGod72> TrashGod72 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[4:08:23] <Tisaric> I think it makes up for it with how fucking cool falling through a black hole is
[4:08:24] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @MachoMadnesss94 You cant run that fast but... you can teleport! Possibly, sort of, kinda... maybe
[4:08:29] <Alphaetus_Prime> nice
[4:08:30] <%demegodz> OH
[4:08:31] <%Niney_Who> BROKE ASS
[4:08:33] <eco419> oof
[4:08:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it's fine
[4:08:34] <Ion_Laser> Welp...
[4:08:35] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat my advice would be - and I KNOW you have a mind goblin that says "complete everything before moving on" - pop over to the Twins and learn some more stuff. This game is strongly non-linear in terms of "completion" since it doesn't matter what order you do things in until you figure out the ending solution.
[4:08:35] <%GarbageQueenEllie> go back to shiiiip

[4:08:52] <EuropantLamprey> Pat has been hit by GER
[4:08:54] <Alphaetus_Prime> that mindset may cause some issues
[4:08:54] <Hawkbone_> The same way you did that with giants Deep
[4:08:54] <+Despera__> Just fly there
[4:08:54] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Now you have to use the Iron Butt
[4:08:55] <CatmanIX> literally just go somewhere else
[4:08:55] <+jcenderion> You just follow the log

[4:08:59] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @AngriestPat that: instant karma
[4:09:00] <Tisaric> The planets can't be completed on their own
[4:09:00] <%ColonelRozum> FailFish
[4:09:01] <%Frost_Quill> Because progression is about knowledge and you need to learn more, I think.

[4:09:02] <aimlesshealer> Just go dick around

[4:09:03] <Endocrom> BEAT your goblins and do it
[4:09:04] <StingtheKing> Sipping ouch juice.
[4:09:11] <Pixel_gee> You're not really supposed to finish each planet in one go- they lead you to other planets
[4:09:12] <@commanderclaw> I think this is a MetroidVania situation
[4:09:13] <sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat because you can't 100% the planets one at a time
[4:09:15] <%dalmek> you didn't finish Giants deep
[4:09:15] <$Dakuu75> *smash* "OOoohh~" *crash* "DAMN IT!" lol <3
[4:09:18] <$ZE_Count> yeah thats true
[4:09:19] <%MelBrooksKA> have you tried not braking with your face?
[4:09:21] <%arcaderabbit48> @BioApple I think its part of why I'm bouncing so hard off of this game. Every part of this adventure feels incredibly unclear. You work hard to enter a new area, only to not know how to progress inside it. Metroidvania games do this too, but those have actual items and limitaitons that make it clear when you can or cant advance. Whereas here, you jsut feel stupid for not being able to figure it out
[4:09:21] <silverira> SPACE GOBLINS!!!!!!!!
[4:09:21] <+Despera__> You can also go to another planet
[4:09:21] <Alphaetus_Prime> yeah fair enough
[4:09:23] <+jpivot> yeah you're supposed to hopscotch around
[4:09:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> see that mountain? we can go there
[4:09:23] <corepool> ok todd
[4:09:24] <Tisaric> You can still get to observatory yeah
[4:09:25] <eco419> beat the goblins
[4:09:26] <%Niney_Who> You can go anywhere
[4:09:27] <%wujak> but you obviously dont know how.
[4:09:27] <+Griffin1171> then don't fall into the black hole
[4:09:27] <Oleai> Is this a WOODEN SPACESHIP?
[4:09:29] <$MachoMadnesss94> @XeroSigmaPrime yes I mean FTL travel, not necessarily moving faster
[4:09:30] <PKLoveLucas> hey, look at it this way, now you know the path!
[4:09:32] <%dalmek> yeah the observatory is doable.
[4:09:33] <$ZE_Count> you can go anywhere pat
[4:09:33] <Hawkbone_> "How can I explore other things before finishing this thing" he says after not finishing Giants Deep.
[4:09:36] <laguerrilha> then go! let the legend come back to life
[4:09:38] <%Yadogari> You are not the sum of your goblins Pat
[4:09:39] <%dalmek> The forge is later
[4:09:40] <danknugglit> DO SPACE YEA
[4:09:42] <Tisaric> he knows how to get there he's just bad at the jetpack
[4:09:47] <Alphaetus_Prime> @Oleai only mostly
[4:09:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> pat there are metarivanian tools you haven't got yet
[4:09:55] <frigglefroogle> all of the planets are connected, going to other ones can help you solve puzzles on planets easier
[4:09:58] <%Frost_Quill> You haven't seen all the planets though. Think about it like "I might be ignoring side areas." and go explore. That should help your mind goblins.
[4:10:01] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> you made it to the Quantum Moon way before you needed to or knew how important it was, you can visit different planets before you finish them
[4:10:11] <Louie_Salmon> @oleai You know this game has like, a whole opening, with characters and stuff, that explains everything
[4:10:16] <eco419> S P A C E
[4:10:19] <frigglefroogle> staying on one without all of the major information is just hitting a big roadblock
[4:10:22] <PKLoveLucas> @hawkbone_ well, that's different, he literally hasn't learned how to progress there
[4:10:28] <Oleai> Louie_Salmon Nah I didn't know that
[4:10:39] <Alphaetus_Prime> just let him do his thing he's not beating his head against a wall yet
[4:10:44] <%aishman> Yeah dude I think you need to go to other planets based on what everyone is saying. Just cause you can go there doesn't mean you should, yet.
[4:10:44] <$RubberFistFight> @Frost_Quill nah I understand his frustration with this. When you get a bee in your bonnet about something it's exceedingly hard to ignore.
[4:10:47] <%Niney_Who> Inb4 black hole'd again
[4:10:51] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Use the jet boost GINGERLY
[4:10:55] <Tisaric> Pat just keeps forgetting to jet boost
[4:10:56] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @AngriestPat hey, you can get straight to the cannon now, that saves time.
[4:10:59] <laguerrilha> love how the game messes with gravity and quantum objects. would have missed this is if Pat didnt stream the game
[4:10:59] <%dalmek> just remember the boost

[4:11:06] <CatmanIX> wat? no

[4:11:20] <%DedlokPM> use the boost to get through
[4:11:21] <%Reveresao> remember the boost up
[4:11:22] <%This_is_Marco> yeayea
[4:11:23] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @MachoMadnesss94 FTL travel is just a way to say, somehow going "faster" than light. I get what you mean tho
[4:11:24] <aimlesshealer> hnngh
[4:11:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I am stumbo, hear me "OOF"
[4:11:29] <eco419> woo
[4:11:32] <Hawkbone_> I could SEE the panic when he couldn't get through
[4:11:34] <Tisaric> it doesn't matter which way you go there either
[4:11:44] <%Reveresao> no find a way Pat
[4:11:44] <Scrub_Seeker> @sshen i dont think his legs are ok though
[4:11:45] <sileo_patronus> oh no
[4:11:48] <$ZE_Count> ahh yeah
[4:11:54] <Tisaric> JET BOOST
[4:11:56] <CatmanIX> use your jetpack genius
[4:11:56] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Use boost
[4:11:56] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @MachoMadnesss94 Honestly, the biggest problem isnt actually making something move FTL
[4:11:56] <Hawkbone_> Use the boost
[4:11:56] <+jcenderion> Boost pat!
[4:11:57] <Monkeyweed21> no they aren't
[4:11:58] <+Griffin1171> boost up at the end

[4:12:33] <eco419> wait
[4:12:37] <$MachoMadnesss94> @XeroSigmaPrime really I just want something that makes colonizing other planets viable. I
[4:12:38] <Junkles> NO
[4:12:41] <Hawkbone_> You almost had it!
[4:12:42] <$ZE_Count> you almost got it
[4:12:42] <%crimsonharvest> oh man you were doing it that was cool
[4:12:43] <Monkeyweed21> boost up stupid
[4:12:44] <CatmanIX> he learned nothing
[4:12:44] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat boost up early so you know how much force it takes you to escape the beam
[4:12:46] <eco419> oof
[4:12:48] <%Niney_Who> apatBig Upsetti
[4:12:49] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @MachoMadnesss94 The bigger issue is to figure that we managed to successfully do it.
[4:12:50] <+jcenderion> Go in and then boost at the end
[4:12:51] <Alphaetus_Prime> he'll get it next time calm down chat
[4:12:51] <%MagickBurritoh> you foolish fool
[4:12:51] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Despera__) (warning)
[4:12:55] <dekkitout> So was that technically a stable orbit
[4:12:55] <PKLoveLucas> you're sooo close, pat
[4:12:56] <+taco_flambe> You have to boost out of the transport beam things
[4:12:56] <%TaifuDragon> because if you fall, you just fall back into the beam anywayu
[4:12:58] <bearalin> You can do it
[4:12:58] <danknugglit> :)
[4:12:59] <Louie_Salmon> Amazing that he could meditate while being sucked into a black hole
[4:13:02] <bearalin> VoHiYo
[4:13:02] <silverira> gravity is such a funny thing
[4:13:04] <+Griffin1171> at the end of the tunnel, FUCKING BOOST!
[4:13:04] <Youwereeatenbyalid> That was some cool shit
[4:13:10] <%This_is_Marco> ah yes I will meditate around the black hole, very calming
[4:13:10] <laguerrilha> vine1more
[4:13:11] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Lööps, brother
[4:13:11] <$MachoMadnesss94> @XeroSigmaPrime itd be a shame if we are doomed to be stranded here forever
[4:13:14] <+jpivot> who told him to get the meditate option
[4:13:15] <Monkeyweed21> pat is very stumb
[4:13:16] <PKLoveLucas> we belieeeve in youuu
[4:13:16] <eco419> ONE MOAR
[4:13:18] <Tisaric> Just go to the end of the bottom one and boost up
[4:13:19] <%Niney_Who> Brute Smarts
[4:13:21] <Alphaetus_Prime> oh wait does he not get it
[4:13:22] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @MachoMadnesss94 Oh that shit is definitely gonna be beyond our lifetime if we try to accomplish it via FTL
[4:13:22] <$ZE_Count> just ride the tunnel then boost
[4:13:24] <%arcaderabbit48> I feel like a single mistake is really punishing in this game. Now he has to go all the way back, try again, and potentially fail and be forced to do it all over again
[4:13:24] <Alphaetus_Prime> oh well
[4:13:35] <%QuadraticGravity> @arcaderabbit48 we get it, you dont like it
[4:13:37] <TheNewPope> boost at the end of the beam
[4:13:39] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @MachoMadnesss94 Unless some miracle discovery happens. LIKE I MEAN MIRACLE
[4:13:45] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @arcaderabbit48 only the ones that kill you. Also, really easy to restart.
[4:13:47] <Alphaetus_Prime> @arcaderabbit48 it's not, it'll take him like 45 seconds to get there again
[4:13:47] <$ZE_Count> Your getting better at flying the pod tho
[4:13:52] <Tisaric> he's also just being really stumbo about it
[4:13:53] <$MachoMadnesss94> @XeroSigmaPrime oh for sure, wish I could live to see it. I just like to hope that one day humans will leave our solar system
[4:13:54] <%arcaderabbit48> @QuadraticGravity Well people were mad before, so I'm trying to explain why
[4:13:55] <Hawkbone_> Fly your ship to the beam cross and then hit eject
[4:13:55] <+Mr_Pylon> It's okay Pat, you got this
[4:13:59] <lotharrio> Have we figured anything out about Groundhog's solar system?
[4:14:01] <dekkitout> At this rate, Pat's gonna end up shoeless with wicked gravity powers
[4:14:09] <$MachoMadnesss94> @XeroSigmaPrime even if im not here to see it
[4:14:11] <eco419> Omg 1 min flight so punishing
[4:14:18] <+jpivot> @arcaderabbit48 tbh he could've just circled the black hole and hit the tractor beam that sends him to the banjo guy and then get back up there, but shrug
[4:14:20] <thunderborn32> @arcaderabbit48 its not the game, its pat forcing a square peg in a round hole
[4:14:23] <aimlesshealer> @eco419 I know right LUL
[4:14:28] <lotharrio> Three point landing!
[4:14:38] <Louie_Salmon> @arcaderabbit48 There's also a bunch of other planets to do stuff on
[4:14:39] <laguerrilha> he takes like 2 minutes to get back at the beans, so it isnt a big deal restarting
[4:14:40] <Alphaetus_Prime> @jpivot that would probably take him longer than just resetting honestly
[4:14:47] <%BioApple> @arcaderabbit48 yeah this area in particular got me a few times, thankfully it was one of the last ones I seriously tackled. I didn't even know how to meditate so I had to burn all my fuel so I could suffocate faster
[4:14:50] <%Gray_skies1993> nice landing there
[4:15:07] <%TaifuDragon> can you boost over the beam here?
[4:15:09] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @MachoMadnesss94 Whats way more likely. We accomplish colonizing planets by something like freezing our selves. Then we totally might do it in our lifetime! (Lifetime being relative to whoever is frozen)
[4:15:14] <+jpivot> @Alphaetus_Prime maybe, maybe not. he could also pick up some jetpack skills during that time :^)
[4:15:15] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @AngriestPat ride, then boost
[4:15:16] <%willjar313> Gettin' some Portal 2 vibes here...
[4:15:21] <eco419> I grieve in his short legs you can do it pat
[4:15:27] <eco419> Believe”
[4:15:27] <sileo_patronus> @BioApple couldn't you just smash into something?
[4:15:37] <$RubberFistFight> I think what a lot of people here need to remember is that there's no "right" or "wrong" path to the game's ending, since the game is all about EXPLORING and LEARNING in a basically-completely-open map.
[4:15:38] <Alphaetus_Prime> grieve is probably more accurate tbh

[4:16:03] <%arcaderabbit48> @BioApple Really seems like the meditation ability should be easier to get. Seeing a lot of people say they never had it or didnt get it until way later, and wasting all your fuel and oxygen just to reset sounds really tedious
[4:16:06] <%BioApple> @sileo_patronus problem with this area is failures lead you into the black hole and you wind up in zero gravity a million miles from your ship

[4:18:50] <eco419> difficult??????
[4:18:51] <Tisaric> it's easier than the fucking PoP
[4:18:52] <+Despera__> You're doing it a harder way
[4:18:52] <Alphaetus_Prime> I mean this is what, your 5th attempt at that segment?
[4:18:53] <thunderborn32> stumbo
[4:18:53] <%crimsonharvest> its mostly hard cause you keep strafing before looking where youre actually going
[4:18:54] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> it does? when do we get to that part?
[4:18:56] <PKLoveLucas> this game is phenomenal but it also has bullshit platforming
[4:18:58] <%Niney_Who> Using your Eyes isn't Platforming, Pat.
[4:18:59] <$ZE_Count> Its not hard you just panic easily.
[4:19:00] <Zalthia> It okay Pat! You can do it!
[4:19:00] <Smart_ZaK1> Chat is being mean
[4:19:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> There's a weird conundrum with leaving our star system, where it will take so long that faster ships will be invented and pass your ass up. The slow cryo-sleep colony ships will leave first and arrive last.

[4:19:04] <KangarooCyborg> XCOM 2 levels of skill over here

[4:19:09] <sileo_patronus> All you have to to is slow down and look at your surroundings
[4:19:12] <silverira> SUPER DIFFICULT baby platforming
[4:19:12] <BinaryBetrayer> I want to see him tackle the twins.
[4:19:13] <%dalmek> take your time, you're rushing a bit too much to do the platforming proper
[4:19:13] <EuropantLamprey> Everything is difficult when fighting against your won self-inflicted GER Hell
[4:19:13] <dekkitout> Path of Pain skirts the line of warcrime
[4:19:13] <$MachoMadnesss94> @XeroSigmaPrime yeah that's the thing right. Whether it's FTL (or close to speed of light) travel or by cryofreezing you run in to either relativity problems or just strait up having to travel for a long time. Then you get the "oh everyone I knew is dead" thing and thats no fun
[4:19:15] <aimlesshealer> Tsunderchat
[4:19:22] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @GeneralSCPatton brightside to that is they can pick us up midflight.
[4:19:23] <danknugglit> chat is a meany poopoo head
[4:19:27] <+AWr00tBear> Look he’s color challenged. Blue and Purple looks the same to him.
[4:19:33] <Jolnir> yea it gets way way worse
[4:19:34] <Louie_Salmon> Punishing, yeah, fair enough
[4:19:36] <KangarooCyborg> like a Mario
[4:19:38] <%Niney_Who> You made 3 consecutive mistakes in the span of 2 seconds
[4:19:40] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Punishing then.
[4:19:44] <CatmanIX> bruh that was like, 5 mistakes, not 1\
[4:19:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the gamecube is blue
[4:19:47] <Gerik1233> you mean punishing
[4:19:49] <+Griffin1171> if only there were other planets
[4:19:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> muffins are cakes
[4:19:51] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Also, Niney_Who isn't wrong.
[4:19:53] <+Despera__> Yeah that's true, luckily this is the only major thing like that
[4:19:54] <Monkeyweed21> but all mistakes are easily avoidable
[4:19:55] <+jcenderion> Just watch your step pat, you're an explorer
[4:20:01] <%BioApple> I think in general the harsh punishment is a signal that if you're doing something risky, you're doing something wrong @AngriestPat
[4:20:06] <eco419> LUL for a game with no enemies i call that fair
[4:20:06] <%dalmek> as much as I love the game, that's a serious problem it has
[4:20:12] <Hawkbone_> Technically there are no consequences to failure if you look at it a certain way
[4:20:13] <MyNameIsRasus> i also had problems with this part
[4:20:14] <zedravan> can you cheese it with the ship?
[4:20:21] <BinaryBetrayer> I cheesed everything with the ship
[4:20:21] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you could always use the ejection from the white hole as an opportunity to explore things that are reasonably close by. You get 22 minutes, and you don't have to constantly apply thrust, just get up to speed and then coast to your target. At least 2 things worth checking out are within thruster-suit distance from white hole station.
[4:20:25] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @MachoMadnesss94 Yea, the 2nd option is wayyy more practical for us rn. Unless some Mass Effect shit happens to the human race, option 1 aint gonna happen anytime soon
[4:20:27] <Gerik1233> LIKE DARK SOULS
[4:20:29] <thunderborn32> its only punishing because they designed it to be so simple they didn't expect people to fail
[4:20:32] <%Gray_skies1993> you got this @AngriestPat ! I believe apatDab
[4:20:35] <BinaryBetrayer> Rammed it between the broken vertical staircases to Black Hole District.
[4:20:35] <KangarooCyborg> Sacrifice your sanity for more time on the Sun
[4:20:37] <Alphaetus_Prime> I have a handful of issues with this game's level design but this isn't one of them
[4:20:41] <dekkitout> I'm sure someone's done it
[4:20:43] <+Despera__> You can totally, it's hard but very doable
[4:20:44] <%TaifuDragon> I cheesed it with the ship but it was more frustrating than just doing this
[4:20:45] <eco419> do it baby woo
[4:20:46] <Monkeyweed21> there's no way to make it less punishing without getting rid of the rad space anxiety
[4:20:46] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @RubberFistFight no BUT HE HASN'T FINISHED BRITTLE HOLLOW THO!!1!!
[4:20:52] <Louie_Salmon> @hawkbone_ But also like, I'm only gonna live so long, so my time is actually the most valuable currency the game could take from me
[4:20:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pride500 *Looking at Outer Wilds* Is this a Kaizo?
[4:20:58] <$ZE_Count> honestly this prob the hardest one in the game pat
[4:21:00] <+jcenderion> You actually can use the ship though, it's kinda finnicky
[4:21:01] <EuropantLamprey> He hasn
[4:21:07] <%arcaderabbit48> @Louie_Salmon Yes. This exactly right here
[4:21:19] <$ZE_Count> now slow down

[4:21:34] <$RubberFistFight> @Youwereeatenbyalid and I totally understand his position on that. I've been there. You feel like you need to prove to the game that you can beat it.
[4:21:37] <Alphaetus_Prime> pretty sure that's by design

[4:30:03] <Broooomy> @839ricky the door just leads outside
[4:30:05] <$RubberFistFight> @839ricky it just leads outside to where the black hole is.
[4:30:06] <laguerrilha> i dint see one
[4:30:09] <MyNameIsRasus> youre fine
[4:30:11] <%Reveresao> the door was just a way to the surface since there's nothing else there
[4:30:11] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @AngriestPat you opened a shortcut, it should be fine.
[4:30:12] <garbageheaphound> chat is a fuck pa
[4:30:13] <$MachoMadnesss94> @AngriestPat just check the ship log, it should tell you if you missed a wall at that location
[4:30:13] <Hawkbone_> They're talking about the door you opened, which just leads outside
[4:30:15] <garbageheaphound> pat
[4:30:15] <Alphaetus_Prime> oh there was another LMAO

[4:31:16] <laguerrilha> @Goldenwolf98 he hit the sun 3x i think
[4:31:17] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Does it not save? I assumed it would because of Nomai shit
[4:31:18] <glaciusinfinite> Take some r&r on giants deep
[4:31:18] <$MachoMadnesss94> @Goldenwolf98 big stumbo
[4:31:21] <HeadsHeldHigh> Pat no dont let the goblins win
[4:31:22] <eco419> you can do it dad

[4:31:25] <Hawkbone_> Try it just in case
[4:31:26] <Louie_Salmon> You can try cheesing this with the ship, if you want
[4:31:27] <dekkitout> Another happy landing
[4:31:27] <Gerik1233> GIANTS DEEP
[4:31:27] <Pixel_gee> S p a c e g o b l i n s
[4:31:27] <Alphaetus_Prime> it's got the asterisk so he did miss something meaningful
[4:31:28] <$ZE_Count> its not important
[4:31:28] <%ColonelRozum> pat why do you have to go full speed at a planet FailFish
[4:31:29] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Have to go, back in 30 or so, if you stop before then ill catch the rest on the VOD, later
[4:31:31] <$RubberFistFight> the only thing that carries over from one loop to the next is memories, guys. Since that's what the "loop" is anyway - he's just remembering the future.
[4:31:39] <BinaryBetrayer> Don{t take it out on your ship Pat.
[4:31:41] <Ion_Laser> SMOrc
[4:31:42] <Broooomy> @Goldenwolf98 he went through a good bit of platforming to get to an area, then reset the games timer before he enspected everything
[4:31:42] <$ZE_Count> its nothing pat
[4:31:47] <+Despera__> You
[4:31:50] <Youwereeatenbyalid> you??
[4:31:51] <%TaifuDragon> That's how it be on this bitch of an earth

[4:31:54] <%Reveresao> Pat's goblins going to come out at the other planets

[4:31:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> apatBig apatGoblin
[4:32:01] <+Pud_Beard> Learned all the big secrets and things yet?
[4:32:02] <danknugglit> Asshole rock
[4:32:02] <Alphaetus_Prime> if the asterisk's there, it's not nothing
[4:32:06] <corepool> pats goblines will consume the universe
[4:32:14] <MyNameIsRasus> I still think you should be able to read your log while out of the ship
[4:32:14] <$RubberFistFight> @Reveresao oh these are SMALL goblins compared to what's coming.
[4:32:16] <%XeroSigmaPrime> STOP RESETING
[4:32:18] <dekkitout> @RubberFistFight So what your're saying- is that the Nomai co-opted King Crimson
[4:32:18] <Goldenwolf98> @Broooomy @MachoMadnesss94 @laguerrilha so business as usual ty for the info LUL
[4:32:20] <Alphaetus_Prime> it won't tell you there's more to explore if the thing you didn't find doesn't really matter
[4:32:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> *stumbs toe* stupid furniture
[4:32:28] <eco419> LUL is fine
[4:32:29] <KangarooCyborg> It's like turning in the test without checking the back of the paper
[4:32:33] <Gerik1233> DO IT LATER
[4:32:34] <Louie_Salmon> You just got so hooked on resetting, it's just like super meat boy
[4:32:40] <Smart_ZaK1> It is late
[4:32:41] <+Griffin1171> ya
[4:32:42] <Monkeyweed21> thats correct
[4:32:44] <%ColonelRozum> your right you are
[4:32:47] <%docpepperphd> its not just you
[4:32:48] <%Reveresao> @rubberfistfight those planets are what I'm referring to
[4:32:50] <+Estuko> @AngriestPat regardless I'm actually having an exceptional amount of fun hanging out and watching you bumble king around
[4:32:50] <Inebriateddonut> I never understand anything when I watch outer wilds
[4:32:51] <Alphaetus_Prime> @KangarooCyborg I did that once and it fucking devastated me
[4:32:51] <laguerrilha> its late tbh
[4:32:52] <%docpepperphd> this planet is tricky
[4:32:52] <%MelBrooksKA> "today"
[4:32:53] <+Despera__> This is definitely the hardest platformming wise
[4:32:56] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @AngriestPat this seems like a really smart/hard game
[4:32:58] <$ZE_Count> you prob like the twins
[4:33:02] <MyNameIsRasus> its because this one is harder
[4:33:03] <Louie_Salmon> Well, you didn't technically finish Giant's Deep
[4:33:05] <suikudo> Could it be because you arent taking your time/
[4:33:05] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This planet's an asshole. It literally has a giant gaping hole
[4:33:06] <+jcenderion> The knowledge you gain from doing this is more important therefor riskier to get
[4:33:12] <$ZE_Count> skilll leanred
[4:33:12] <HeadsHeldHigh> well after you beat this you can say you are the big brain boy
[4:33:12] <Moonlight_Grimoire> this planet is very 3 dimensional, others were very two dimensional
[4:33:14] <$MachoMadnesss94> some planets are easier than others
[4:33:14] <%Frost_Quill> I can't believe I'm finding Dark Souls challenging, Mario was a cakewalk.
[4:33:16] <BinaryBetrayer> That's the thing. Everyone loves games where information and knowledge are the powerups, right until the time they make you feel stupid for hours.
[4:33:17] <Hawkbone_> You haven't finished a single planet yet, Pat. Even Timber Hearth has more secrets.
[4:33:22] <zedravan> no fear
[4:33:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @GarbageQueenEllie gurl, pls
[4:33:30] <$RubberFistFight> @dekkitout well imho, it's technically a time loop, since it's just memory being sent 22 minutes back. There was that whole wall about "is sending memory back the same as sending ME back" that made Pat bellow "I DON'T KNOW". So time itself isn't being reset -the Nomai basically just built a big save-scumming machine.
[4:33:41] <$RubberFistFight> @dekkitout technically NOT a time loop, sorry.
[4:33:45] <eco419> hardcore parkour
[4:33:45] <$ZE_Count> badass
[4:33:46] <Alphaetus_Prime> see how easy that was now that he knows how?

[4:34:31] <Gerik1233> black hole?
[4:34:31] <Moonlight_Grimoire> fell in
[4:34:32] <Smart_ZaK1> OOP
[4:34:33] <%ColonelRozum> FailFish
[4:34:33] <%crimsonharvest> the black hole, eventually it probably falls in
[4:34:33] <%Frost_Quill> You didn't land.
[4:34:34] <sileo_patronus> fell in I guess
[4:34:34] <+Shaggnar> Landed it sideways
[4:34:35] <Inebriateddonut> welp bye
[4:34:36] <$RubberFistFight> @QuadraticGravity it's literally a discussion that happens in the game, dude.
[4:34:36] <eco419> bye ship
[4:34:37] <danknugglit> Dude wheres my car
[4:34:37] <ssebblue> CY@
[4:34:38] <suikudo> you kinda just crashed and jumped out
[4:34:39] <dekkitout> Science, I ain't gotta explain shit!
[4:34:39] <BinaryBetrayer> Blacked
[4:34:39] <Youwereeatenbyalid> it fell in.
[4:34:40] <beautyfulman> part of the planet broke probably
[4:34:41] <$MachoMadnesss94> oh wait you mean that ship
[4:34:42] <%Toast_Master_General> Black hole
[4:34:42] <beautyfulman> and it fell in
[4:34:45] <%ColonelRozum> you landed it sideways
[4:34:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> where we're going, we don't need ships
[4:34:50] <Louie_Salmon> Oh well, you'll be closer to Giants Deep when you reset anyway
[4:34:50] <Goldenwolf98> You parked it upside down
[4:34:54] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @AngriestPat far side
[4:34:55] <+drwhofan999> it fell in the black hole
[4:34:56] <Alphaetus_Prime> that was the new one pat
[4:34:57] <$MachoMadnesss94> "dude where's my ship"
[4:34:58] <silverira> why lad properly?
[4:35:03] <mankeyfigh> PAT YOU DIDNT READ
[4:35:03] <+MellowMute> that was the new one
[4:35:05] <$ZE_Count> you got to read evrything
[4:35:07] <aimlesshealer> LUL
[4:35:10] <suikudo> LUL
[4:35:12] <MyNameIsRasus> YOU DIDNT READ IT
[4:35:15] <eco419> pat

[4:35:26] <+Mr_Pylon> black hole
[4:35:30] <$MachoMadnesss94> WHY WONT IT READ!?
[4:35:35] <suikudo> Are you ok? @AngriestPat Tired maybe?
[4:35:43] <dekkitout> Alternative Hypothesis: The eye is not on the moon
[4:36:00] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Hi little tired
[4:36:01] <faegbeard> maybe do a big double check
[4:36:02] <%GarbageQueenEllie> The eye wants you to deliver it McDonald's
[4:36:05] <eco419> SLEEP DONT be late for podcast
[4:36:18] <+Griffin1171> hypothesis: the eyes are not in Pat's head
[4:36:20] <%XeroSigmaPrime> YOU MISSED ONE
[4:36:21] <$ZE_Count> ohh yeah podcast tomorrow pat
[4:36:23] <sileo_patronus> Yes you ccan
[4:36:24] <Hawkbone_> Time to die
[4:36:24] <BinaryBetrayer> Now get to the forge.
[4:36:32] <Youwereeatenbyalid> yeah you can
[4:36:32] <%Deadpal> There's a thing on the wall
[4:36:33] <$ZE_Count> fall in black hole
[4:36:37] <+MellowMute> meditate and book it to giant's deep?
[4:36:37] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Go for it you coward.
[4:36:38] <Louie_Salmon> Wait hold up did he actually miss one still
[4:36:39] <Alphaetus_Prime> nooooo
[4:36:39] <%QuadraticGravity> No they're being stump
[4:36:40] <%Deadpal> riiiight there
[4:36:41] <$MachoMadnesss94> just do a big jump
[4:36:41] <+jpivot> why not? you could just go into the black hole
[4:36:42] <%Deadpal> there ya go
[4:36:42] <+drwhofan999> just go though the black hole
[4:36:42] <$RubberFistFight> @dekkitout well i mean the game just directly referred to them as two separate locations, and we know that the moon orbits random places in the solar system, but the Eye orbits the sun in a quantum superposition (since the wall just said that)
[4:36:45] <$MachoMadnesss94> do a flip
[4:36:50] <BinaryBetrayer> Go to the black hole, then explore Bramble
[4:36:50] <Tisaric> he got this one
[4:36:52] <Moonlight_Grimoire> I think it's reset time
[4:36:53] <%Deadpal> do a flip into the black hole!
[4:36:54] <%XeroSigmaPrime> LOL He did not miss one, im just trolling
[4:36:54] <Louie_Salmon> Like up on top was there a third one?
[4:36:57] <sileo_patronus> I think that's all
[4:37:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> cmonBruh
[4:37:04] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @XeroSigmaPrime my dude.
[4:37:04] <+pooperscooper14> no he got em all
[4:37:05] <Louie_Salmon> @xerosigmaprime Okay jeez, you got me
[4:37:06] <Alphaetus_Prime> what a motherfucker
[4:37:07] <$ZE_Count> Under the sea
[4:37:07] <NeroInfinite> he got all three
[4:37:07] <sileo_patronus> too bad the ship fucked off
[4:37:15] <eco419> nice
[4:37:17] <dekkitout> I was making a joke about hypothesis testing in statistics
[4:37:19] <Youwereeatenbyalid> yeyeye
[4:37:19] <%QuadraticGravity> Lets GEAUX
[4:37:21] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Go kill the Ocean, Pat
[4:37:23] <frigglefroogle> just reset, make your life easier
[4:37:24] <+Mr_Pylon> nah just black hole yourself
[4:37:24] <%XeroSigmaPrime> WHERE WE DROPPING BOIS
[4:37:25] <%Frost_Quill> Check just to make sure you got it all.
[4:37:26] <aimlesshealer> More like Giant's YEET
[4:37:26] <glaciusinfinite> it's rewind time
[4:37:30] <mankeyfigh> I WONDERRRRR
[4:37:31] <%TaifuDragon> Ship's log is your brain
[4:37:31] <%Frost_Quill> I think YOU'RE writing it out.
[4:37:31] <Monkeyweed21> dont worry about it
[4:37:31] <$RubberFistFight> @dekkitout oh, lol. I'm bad at statistics XD
[4:37:32] <+Despera__> Brain link
[4:37:33] <%TaifuDragon> and also video games
[4:37:33] <BinaryBetrayer> Because gameply
[4:37:33] <Louie_Salmon> Probably just QOL
[4:37:33] <$MachoMadnesss94> thats a good point
[4:37:35] <Alphaetus_Prime> I KNOW RIGHT
[4:37:37] <KangarooCyborg> Progress: "Guess I'll die"
[4:37:37] <%BioApple> i think the canon explanation is you just fill it in really fast every loop
[4:37:37] <Hawkbone_> HOLY SHIT
[4:37:39] <+cursedwithadhd> reasons
[4:37:40] <+Shaggnar> Because you'd forget
[4:37:42] <%Deadpal> annnnd it's gone
[4:37:42] <eco419> is THE LOCKER
[4:37:43] <PKLoveLucas> isn't it made with nomai tech?
[4:37:44] <+Griffin1171> THIS GAME'S AWESOME
[4:37:45] <Goldenwolf98> I think it just contains it because gameplay reasons LUL
[4:37:47] <$MachoMadnesss94> bye moon
[4:37:48] <Tisaric> The quantum moon is so fucking cool
[4:37:48] <+jpivot> its got that blue stuff underneath
[4:37:49] <HeadsHeldHigh> fucking quantum bitch
[4:37:49] <%Deadpal> this game is so great
[4:37:50] <Broooomy> its maintains them because the game needed a way for you to catalog all of the shit your finding
[4:37:53] <+jcenderion> Sometimes it dissapears when you blink waking up.
[4:37:53] <%Gray_skies1993> good progress so far @AngriestPat apatBig apatDab
[4:37:55] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @AngriestPat it's got a bunch of nomai shit coming out the bottom
[4:37:56] <$ZE_Count> honestly you should be able to see your log without ship.
[4:38:00] <+MellowMute> Imagine if the probe launched straight into the quantum moon LuL
[4:38:09] <shinichizio> Got it in one! SeemsGood
[4:38:10] <Louie_Salmon> @jcenderion Oh man that's great
[4:38:20] <HeadsHeldHigh> Yo
[4:38:21] <%QuadraticGravity> Let's go swimming, gang
[4:38:24] <Hawkbone_> What if the MC is re-typing everything every time because he has a photographic memory
[4:38:25] <$RubberFistFight> @MellowMute that's probably happened on a few of the loops
[4:38:30] <%Frost_Quill> Maybe the computer is a super primitive thing your species built based on Nomai tech, maybe it's reading your memories.
[4:38:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I didn't bring my swim trunks
[4:38:36] <danknugglit> You have made alot of progress pat, though it may not feel like it
[4:38:37] <laguerrilha> undah the sea
[4:38:37] <+Micalica> the logic is likely that your memories get sent to you upon waking up, so it's your character "writing" the entries themselves into the ship
[4:38:41] <Tisaric> no it's a long game
[4:38:45] <sileo_patronus> nah fuck that
[4:38:46] <Smart_ZaK1> 3
[4:38:47] <%Deadpal> This is a "bang it out when you figure it out"
[4:38:47] <Alphaetus_Prime> 3 is quite optimistic yeah
[4:38:48] <dekkitout> Yeah, 3, weeks
[4:38:51] <Monkeyweed21> it didn't get harder you got dumber
[4:38:51] <mankeyfigh> @AngriestPat Talk to loop buddy again
[4:38:51] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat oh my, no. You have HOUUUURRRRS of exploration left to go.
[4:38:52] <+jpivot> the computer was made out of a chunk of the same statue you got linked with
[4:38:53] <%Deadpal> which... in my case took about 2 weeks lol
[4:38:57] <danknugglit> You did alot of important stuff
[4:38:58] <$ZE_Count> just play this all week
[4:38:58] <+jpivot> some dude in the village mentions it
[4:39:02] <eco419> big brain
[4:39:11] <+Griffin1171> hope you don't immediately hit another wall
[4:39:14] <+jcenderion> This is a 3-5 game easily
[4:39:16] <%Deadpal> Do everything go everywhere, find every single question mark and do it
[4:39:24] <Smart_ZaK1> Did he ever land on Giant's Deep's Moon?
[4:39:29] <eco419> yeyeye
[4:39:36] <shinichizio> Sploosh!
[4:39:38] <%BioApple> @Smart_ZaK1 that was the quantum moon, looked liek
[4:39:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YOOOOOOO
[4:39:42] <dekkitout> Groovy!
[4:39:44] <aimlesshealer> But wait, why does it look like that if it's going down?!
[4:39:44] <Hawkbone_> @Smart_ZaK1 Giants Deep doesn't have a moon

[4:40:04] <%Reveresao> actually thought that that this was the solution when I originally got to Giants deep but I couldn't find a cyclone then later on when actually found it I was pissed about it.
[4:40:05] <danknugglit> You need knowledge
[4:40:05] <$MachoMadnesss94> why you do dis?

[4:41:06] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat there's a way through, but you have to determine it.
[4:41:06] <Louie_Salmon> It sure was scary though
[4:41:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[4:41:11] <BinaryBetrayer> ANOTHER wall
[4:41:13] <$MachoMadnesss94> one answer gives rise to new questions
[4:41:13] <$ZE_Count> it was cool
[4:41:14] <%QuadraticGravity> You only know how to go under the current now :)
[4:41:14] <garbageheaphound> what the shit was that
[4:41:17] <+pooperscooper14> pretty sure pat hasn't been to the dark place
[4:41:17] <Zalthia> Pat why
[4:41:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @Goldenwolf98 LUL LUL
[4:41:23] <Pixel_gee> You have a note about Feldspar, which helps with that
[4:41:28] <%Gray_skies1993> @AngriestPat remember, you saw from inside there when you shot your probe through the bramble seed on Timber Hearth
[4:41:30] <EuropantLamprey> "Oh look, a big ball of black evil, LETS TOUCH IT!"
[4:41:33] <Tisaric> There's somewhere else you can get no that you know how to get under the current though
[4:41:34] <+Shaggnar> Let me just rub my dick against this giant jellyfish
[4:41:35] <+jcenderion> The core of giants deep has one of the most important secrets in the game.
[4:41:40] <sileo_patronus> @AngriestPat Giant's Deep has 2FA
[4:41:41] <danknugglit> Literal wall LUL
[4:41:45] <+cursedwithadhd> u saw and attemted the solution
[4:41:50] <HeadsHeldHigh> blasto zappy wall
[4:41:53] <Alphaetus_Prime> 🤔
[4:41:54] <Hawkbone_> Feldspar knows
[4:42:00] <Monkeyweed21> he knows the way
[4:42:00] <Hawkbone_> We have to find Feldspar.
[4:42:03] <+jcenderion> Gonna have to find him
[4:42:03] <BinaryBetrayer> Feldspar knows
[4:42:05] <BinaryBetrayer> Find HIm
[4:42:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Zapping system doesn't work that way
[4:42:07] <+Mr_Pylon> Feldspar made it in...
[4:42:15] <$MachoMadnesss94> chill chat
[4:42:15] <Tisaric> Getting to the core of Giant's Deep is such a cool experience
[4:42:16] <%Frost_Quill> Fucking hell chat why.
[4:42:19] <$ZE_Count> BRUTE SMART
[4:42:20] <Alphaetus_Prime> wtf why
[4:42:21] <PKLoveLucas> hmmm, a jellyfish on bramble island?
[4:42:23] <MyNameIsRasus> DARK BRAMBLE HYPE
[4:42:30] <Hawkbone_> @Frost_Quill What? We didn't spoil anything
[4:42:30] <HeadsHeldHigh> Ahhhhh stop chat
[4:42:32] <NumbusPlays> hype for jellyfish
[4:42:32] <BinaryBetrayer> Never gonna get it, never gonna get it...
[4:42:34] <Mitchell87mc> you sir played my butt like jazz
[4:42:35] <eco419> Zapping systemm indeed
[4:42:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Kill Feldspar and then eat the jellyfish
[4:42:39] <sileo_patronus> IF FELDSPAR DID IT-
[4:42:42] <+Griffin1171> it's straight up from your ship
[4:42:43] <$RubberFistFight> You can actually BROOT SMORT your way through it - afaik there's at least 2 ways to discover the way
[4:42:47] <glaciusinfinite> PAT WILL FIGURE IT OUT
[4:42:52] <Hawkbone_> Why y'all mad? We didn't spoil anything.
[4:42:53] <CatmanIX> chat stop what? he just read the text that told him feldsparr knew how to get in?
[4:42:54] <Zalthia> I believe in pat!
[4:42:57] <+jpivot> lmao im really curious to see if he'll figure it out now
[4:42:57] <HeadsHeldHigh> this one is ez
[4:42:59] <laguerrilha> let him try, nothing to lose
[4:43:00] <Junkles> pieS
[4:43:05] <+Griffin1171> it's harder to brute smart after the patch
[4:43:05] <Junkles> 800m/s
[4:43:06] <glaciusinfinite> Believe
[4:43:07] <dekkitout> If we're going jellyfishing, remember to firmly grasp it.
[4:43:08] <eco419> VoteYea
[4:43:11] <Naoyin> throw feldspar at the core to distract the electricity
[4:43:12] <$MachoMadnesss94> If Feldspar jumped off a bridge would you do it too?
[4:43:13] <BinaryBetrayer> No
[4:43:13] <$ZE_Count> I wanted to see pat go to dark bramble
[4:43:15] <%arcaderabbit48> Okay, ram into it again but this time go from space. Just like, maximum speed. Go so fast time and space starts to warp in your favor and SMASH that shit
[4:43:15] <+Wakkadude21> you are telling him exactly where to look
[4:43:17] <Tisaric> It would be really cool to see him find it this early
[4:43:17] <+Wakkadude21> stop
[4:43:17] <%arancet> its not something youre supposed to figure out yet..
[4:43:17] <$RubberFistFight> @Hawkbone_ breathing = spoilers, apparently.
[4:43:33] <$MachoMadnesss94> lets see if he can brute smarts it
[4:43:36] <Scrub_Seeker> @MachoMadnesss94 i guess if i was stuck in a time loop i would
[4:43:37] <danknugglit> Take our energy pat \ PogChamp /
[4:43:38] <Hawkbone_> @MachoMadnesss94 Yes because I'm in a time loop, so if I die I'll be fine
[4:43:55] <Alphaetus_Prime> @RubberFistFight bro you're literally trying to hold pat's hand and guide him through this whole game just stop
[4:44:03] <eco419> okok
[4:44:17] <$MachoMadnesss94> death would still hurt @Scrub_Seeker @Hawkbone_
[4:44:24] <Tisaric> It's so fucking smart
[4:44:28] <HeadsHeldHigh> yeah its the funniest thing
[4:44:34] <dekkitout> Get alog, lil tornado.
[4:44:38] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> baker's match

[4:49:08] <eco419> omg
[4:49:12] <+jpivot> its just gonna be another clockwise tornado tier solution
[4:49:15] <CatmanIX> thas a bramble seed
[4:49:35] <+Griffin1171> go into the counterclockwise jellyfish
[4:49:37] <Tisaric> it really is another clockwise tornado type solution yeah

[4:50:06] <Monkeyweed21> have you tried swimming in yourself?
[4:50:07] <%arcaderabbit48> It looks like huge coral branches
[4:50:08] <Hawkbone_> How the fuck did Feldspar figure this out?
[4:50:08] <jorgenbob> Do a happy feet, wombo combo
[4:50:09] <redial_nick> just timestop
[4:50:10] <%aishman> Can you touch the branch that's peaking out?
[4:50:11] <corepool> probably need to do another planet?
[4:50:13] <+jpivot> >:^)
[4:50:16] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Go for a swim, maybe?
[4:50:21] <Alphaetus_Prime> @Hawkbone_ it's explained

[4:51:17] <+Griffin1171> electricity isn't there if you don't look at it
[4:51:18] <ssks123> you have a space suit pat
[4:51:19] <Smart_ZaK1> Mad Lad
[4:51:20] <Louie_Salmon> Worth a shot, I suppose
[4:51:20] <%QuadraticGravity> It was a good idea
[4:51:25] <laguerrilha> LUL
[4:51:25] <Monkeyweed21> try swimming in
[4:51:27] <Tisaric> fair thought
[4:51:27] <$ZE_Count> that would of been neat
[4:51:29] <sileo_patronus> fair I guess
[4:51:30] <shinichizio> electromagnets dont real
[4:51:31] <+spheelman> maybe something to do with the planets poles?
[4:51:32] <Smart_ZaK1> Get out and swim
[4:51:34] <$MachoMadnesss94> ya know what that's a fair guess
[4:51:34] <%AncelDeLambert> every time I hear the word "quantum", I flinch
[4:51:37] <BinaryBetrayer> Magnets
[4:51:38] <Youwereeatenbyalid> oh yeah that's reasonable.
[4:51:39] <Goldenwolf98> Just jump in the waters great Kappa
[4:51:40] <aimlesshealer> Touch it with your space peen
[4:51:40] <%arcaderabbit48> @Griffin1171 Hasn't that exact logic actually already been used in this game?
[4:51:42] <Gerik1233> try swimming
[4:51:43] <%aishman> Pat, maybe touching the branch that's peaking out will electrify the suit or something?
[4:51:45] <+Micalica> There he goes
[4:51:45] <NeroInfinite> I mean pat was on to something with the jellyfish
[4:51:48] <eco419> quantum
[4:51:51] <dekkitout> Electromagnets? How the fuck do they work? NotLikeThis
[4:51:54] <%aishman> I've never played or seen this game be played so I have no clue.
[4:51:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> your electrical system is down
[4:51:56] <%AncelDeLambert> My body wants to scream "THAT'S NOT HOW QUANTUM WORKS!" but it's a game so I shhhhhhhh
[4:51:58] <Hawkbone_> The electricity fried your lights
[4:51:59] <danknugglit> Use your timestop
[4:51:59] <sileo_patronus> Your electrics are busted anyway
[4:52:00] <%0dokuro> The hint is Jellyfish

[4:52:21] <%Toast_Master_General> Does your space suit conduct electricity?
[4:52:23] <eco419> wont
[4:52:24] <+SWindleFeD> @AngriestPat is it possible to turn off the ship while it's moving forward?
[4:52:24] <corepool> why do yall love to spoil
[4:52:25] <aimlesshealer> Reactor-chan, please.
[4:52:29] <%Frost_Quill> Chat shut the fuck up.
[4:52:30] <garbageheaphound> Pat go to Feldpar
[4:52:32] <laguerrilha> ooooooook
[4:52:32] <jorgenbob> Pat this is what happens when you dont pay the electric bill
[4:52:32] <+Micalica> it can take the abuse, that god damn reactor has had it too good for too long
[4:52:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AncelDeLambert ye we know super position is the correct way to talk about it
[4:52:41] <dekkitout> Reactor-kun is getting put through the pacers
[4:52:41] <MyNameIsRasus> ship broke
[4:52:45] <%BioApple> i like how pat admits to struggling super hard with the puzzles but as soon as he hears some npc figured it out he's all "can't get shown up by an npc now can i"
[4:52:46] <eco419> he is so ded
[4:52:50] <danknugglit> F
[4:52:50] <%MagickBurritoh> what
[4:52:55] <+jcenderion> oops
[4:52:56] <Goldenwolf98> Pat you are doing the same thing over and over
[4:52:57] <%QuadraticGravity> Fuck it swim
[4:53:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> who needs a ship
[4:53:04] <%docpepperphd> i got scared that would work lmao
[4:53:05] <%wujak> well this is terrifying
[4:53:05] <%Onlysamfisher > only thing I can think of is organic material like the jellyfish can pass but electronics cant, so maybe try going through with just your suit?
[4:53:06] <sileo_patronus> that's depressing
[4:53:07] <NeroInfinite> dead
[4:53:09] <shinichizio> This is not how you swim
[4:53:09] <dekkitout> He's gonna lick it!
[4:53:09] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Well when in doubt, do it yourself I guess.
[4:53:10] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh
[4:53:13] <$MachoMadnesss94> Stop helping unless asked chat pls. You are contaminating this pat experiment. It needs to learn for itself or else the data we gather is USELESS
[4:53:15] <%Onlysamfisher > damn
[4:53:16] <aimlesshealer> Damn!
[4:53:20] <+Shaggnar> Hmm rooThink

[4:56:59] <%realm_forge> Paige should play this
[4:57:02] <Louie_Salmon> This game pounds the back, of your brain
[4:57:11] <%0dokuro> Paige would be sooooooo lost lol
[4:57:14] <faegbeard> exactly
[4:57:16] <+KoyaMusa> she HATES space
[4:57:17] <%NWR_James> exactly
[4:57:19] <MasterDecoder> Wait, Podcast wasn't today? Cool, I always forget on Mondays
[4:57:19] <%arancet> she survived portal
[4:57:19] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> that's the point
[4:57:19] <Ner234> ACTUAL DEATH
[4:57:20] <%demegodz> Paige should absolutely not play this for suuuuure

[4:57:27] <Monkeyweed21> and not from the puzzles
[4:57:29] <$MachoMadnesss94> LUL
[4:57:30] <%TaifuDragon> she'd fly into space and then shit her pants
[4:57:31] <+Shaggnar> I bet she'd do a better job roo4
[4:57:31] <%wujak> or she would brute smarts into the ending in an hour
[4:57:31] <Yukasmarvin> The biggest of deaths
[4:57:32] <Endocrom> The "space night" thing would kill her
[4:57:32] <%Frost_Quill> BIG dead.
[4:57:34] <KangarooCyborg> Make sure it's extra sundowny when she plays
[4:57:34] <%demegodz> House would be on fire from brain over head
[4:57:36] <@commanderclaw> She should stream Fire Emblem so we can judge her tastes in waifus\

[4:57:38] <%RupanSen> quantum sundowning
[4:57:39] <Ion_Laser> Paige would lose her shit leaving the first planet's atmosphere
