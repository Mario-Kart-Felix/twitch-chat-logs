Enjoy the game!!

[0:05:01] <~PatStaresAt> I do adhere to a schedule and have for a while double tap but if I get review codes for shit before public release Im going to play them dumbass

[0:28:06] <+Pengers> agreed
[0:28:06] <LoreKeeper_Thal> 4U
[0:28:06] <LordOfThePoultry> story in mh LUL
[0:28:06] <+McSoliace> all of the mh stories suck except 4
[0:28:06] <+TenKaiHunter> Valor was gross. Easy, powerful, and gross.
[0:28:07] <%YakumoYomi> And it had unskippable cutscenes\
[0:28:08] <blackbookalpha> monke brain just hunt monsters

[0:28:12] <rReizs> oh no this monster oh no it wasnt this monster oh it was an elder dragon, no it was this other elder dragon!
[0:28:13] <Kaji04> MH4 is the best story
[0:28:14] <+Shishi1205> Ace commander
[0:28:15] <OwlLightningMage> The only good Hunting game story is Soul Sacrifice
[0:28:18] <%BoxNavy> you can skip cutscenes now :)
[0:28:18] <+alphonseisbest> 4U BABY

[0:28:24] <cyb3r_demon> oh no large lizard time to kill it
[0:28:24] <%JoshManVGH> Monster Hunter story: There monster, go make hat.

[0:28:25] <penitentpendant> Also base World had too much 'waifu' in your partner
[0:28:26] <+thelonechris> I always assumed the MH story was "Monster bad. Kill monster."
[0:28:28] <Kaji04> then there's the scarred kush
[0:28:29] <+panlakes> MHW has the same story intro as the OLD Final Fantasy XIV
[0:28:30] <+Pengers> do we know if the online is good?
[0:28:31] <red_fox_zero> For real. Just want to slap the beasts.
[0:28:31] <raveous> HELL YEAH
[0:28:32] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Soul Sacrifice is great
[0:28:32] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt the one with the best story is one The Witcher
[0:28:33] <%WhereIsWill> 4U is the truth
[0:28:34] <+Ristwach> 4U ALL DAY
[0:28:35] <+AWr00tBear> I hope Rise G gives HBG sprinting siege fire lol that would be busted
[0:28:37] <+TenKaiHunter> Freedom Wars?
[0:28:37] <+wizard_of_diamonds> MHW Had a perfectly good story I don't get all the hate
[0:28:38] <+McSoliace> mh4 story actually got me kinda hype
[0:28:39] <%YakumoYomi> And it's trapped in Vita jail
[0:28:42] <simplyvince15> SOUL SACRIFICE!!!
[0:28:44] <%ConLin_Arts_> Sagaru Magala is my favorite monster
[0:28:46] <$Dakuu75> MHW's story was litterally: This big monster is fucking up the ecosystem, no wait it was actualy THIS big monster, NO WAIT- it was THIS BIG MONSTER. and it never stopped
[0:28:48] <Manwad> too bad you can never play soul sacrifice
[0:28:48] <arisato98> maybe god eater, maybe.
[0:28:50] <skagtheprinceofhell> I was never able to play Soul Sacrafice... why aren't they porting that off the Vita to something else again?
[0:28:51] <%Grimlockfly> SwiftRage500 shaddup story, we got Monsters to hunt!
[0:28:52] <Crimson_helm> Vita means death
[0:28:52] <%pearsnickety> Rise seems to be similar, oh shit the rampage, gotta go stop it, oh shit Wyverian Waifus.
[0:28:52] <%ConLin_Arts_> 4U was also my first MH
[0:28:53] <Ultimatefool> Vita hell

[0:29:09] <yourliteraldog> TDOT Weed
[0:29:14] <bear_breaker20> freedom wars is unfinished...
[0:29:15] <%captain_thickthighs> vacation
[0:29:18] <OwlLightningMage> Freedom Wars had potential. That's it
[0:29:20] <Discount_CJ> Why wouldn't the story for every MH be just "Monster bad, kill monster?"
[0:29:20] <%MidnightBurst12> fucking gottem
[0:29:28] <%captain_thickthighs> I don't see the point of vacationing to Toronto if that same time I could just go to New York
[0:29:33] <yourliteraldog> Drake is from Toronto
[0:29:41] <%ExpressNode> I have freedom wars but never really played it

[0:29:54] <%valriot> Isnt there like 2
[0:29:55] <+Shishi1205> dlc is going to be elder dragon fiesta
[0:29:58] <jcflyguy> So far
[0:29:59] <%AlteisenReiseZ> At least there's no Kushala Daora
[0:30:00] <Mattais88> DLC
[0:30:01] <%TrafficCohen> DLC next month
[0:30:01] <rei0> all dlc
[0:30:02] <Shin_goob> are you guys ready for mario's public execution on march 31st
[0:30:02] <UnfilteredComic> Theyre gonna have the Apex versions though
[0:30:02] <%chance_h> Something something darkside
[0:30:04] <%YakumoYomi> The game seems like it's literally unfinished
[0:30:04] <%pearsnickety> DLC1 seems to be loading up the Elder Dragons.
[0:30:05] <%debugdrawray_> the DLC delivery is gonna be huge, theres a leaked list
[0:30:06] <TheAlmostBlind> my vision gotten too bad 4 reading, shooting at games and driving at games, wonder if I would be able to play a Monster Hunter
[0:30:08] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[0:30:09] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Honestly i like it, World had way too many.
[0:30:09] <hairtoday> switch can't handle more than 2 elders
[0:30:12] <Vaunno> gee i wonder if they will expand it
[0:30:14] <%TheWinged7> I want Lunastra back
[0:30:14] <%bevyrage> so you don't want the WORLD style of updates huh
[0:30:14] <bear_breaker20> @ExpressNode its fun but its not worth beating since they ran out of time and money
[0:30:17] <%CalderGaming> BOO KUSHALA
[0:30:17] <Ultra_Pancake> That's probably exactly what the updates will be like lol.
[0:30:17] <+blaze__drag> I think it's confirmed that that is literally exactly what's going to happen
[0:30:17] <%Agami23> just dont have teostra or lunastra
[0:30:17] <blackbookalpha> What if it was Lagiacrus?
[0:30:18] <+Shishi1205> Pray hard then
[0:30:19] <+Das_Prints> Apparently COVID had something to do with that.
[0:30:19] <%TrafficCohen> This game came out at the end of the fiscal year, it's a month early
[0:30:23] <oedocontroller> why can you play it an nintendo tells me to fuck off
[0:30:24] <$RealThiele> dlc waiting for switch pro
[0:30:25] <+BettyMwwaahh> the first update said it would add Chamelos and "several monsters"
[0:30:30] <+SpaceHobo55> Its not great on endgame as I hear so its gonna be a bit
[0:30:32] <+TenKaiHunter> I like the idea of grappling giant robots and hacking their parts off. Its like carving mid fight.
[0:30:33] <pitsuji> What if they bundled em
[0:30:34] <SFdvus> Are you John titor?
[0:30:34] <KaiserMario> Zorah Magdaros
[0:30:34] <%maenos2> leak - there's monsters
[0:30:35] <skagtheprinceofhell> Well, the first monster we know of is Chameleos
[0:30:35] <%CalderGaming> DAMMIT
[0:30:37] <Vaunno> chameleos woooo
[0:30:38] <+Shishi1205> Several implies that
[0:30:39] <+GrandmasterBFunk> My wish would be that they add multiple monsters, one new one, and one returning one
[0:30:39] <+abrupt_abe> Boooo, windy boy is back
[0:30:41] <%BoxNavy> april is lizard boy
[0:30:41] <%valriot> The generally endgame here is err... hmmm
[0:30:42] <+HotSnake1989> World 1.2
[0:30:42] <%Ghufufin> i thought lunastra plus teostra was fun
[0:30:43] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Doesn't that make sense tho? The main reason World had a metric fuck ton of Elders because they go to the New World to die
[0:30:44] <%CalderGaming> yup

[0:31:31] <OneThousandTomatoes> which is why theres a lot of world mons in rise
[0:31:31] <mike2hands> WHERE'S MY MH ONE GANG!!!?
[0:31:32] <%baka_sugoi> yee

[0:31:46] <+CookieCutter007> what a deal
[0:31:47] <+jofrankii> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:31:48] <BaronVonProlix> its also why so many monsters look similar i imagine, like Nargacuga and tigrex etc
[0:31:49] <+abrupt_abe> Wut
[0:31:50] <%debugdrawray_> @PatStaresAt  *** this is from a datamine so it might be changed from now till then
[0:31:51] <+Shishi1205> a lot of banger tho
[0:31:51] <Cynical2DD> I started with the one on 3DS and didn’t get anywhere because I had no idea what to fucking do
[0:31:51] <Vaunno> Oh god i forgot
[0:31:53] <OwlLightningMage> 18 LUL
[0:31:53] <penitentpendant> Monster Hunter feels a bit like Persona. Whichever game you start at you want to go forward, because the QoL you lose going backward can be PAINFUL.
[0:31:53] <%TrafficCohen> LOL
[0:31:53] <%Wulfphelz> 18 YALL!!!
[0:31:54] <%superc37> HO BOI
[0:31:55] <%YakumoYomi> Underwater combat, tho
[0:31:55] <%pearsnickety> MOST OF WHICH WERE UNDERWATER FIGHTS
[0:31:55] <%ssjklyco> In the wrong hands, Monster Hunter could become the most effective gatcha game.
[0:31:57] <%Mantorok06> psaBig
[0:31:58] <+Shishi1205> And Ceadeus @PatStaresAt
[0:32:00] <%Azurism_> was Ceadeus in the original Tri?

[0:32:00] <%sleeplessmetro> Tri was Abysmal
[0:32:03] <jorniev> WHOLE 18 WOWIE
[0:32:05] <skagtheprinceofhell> Still kind of wish they brought back Plesioth given they fixed the hitboxes so much.
[0:32:05] <+blaze__drag> Tri was technically my first game, and shockingly, I didn't get into the series at the time till I tried 4 lol
[0:32:06] <%ExpressNode> Was there ever a monster Hunter on the PS3?

[0:32:50] <+TenKaiHunter> World 2 should get Frontier monsters.
[0:32:51] <%JoshManVGH> Jesus that's a lot of monsters.
[0:32:54] <%ssjklyco> EA developed Monster Hunter: Micro transaction Nightmare

[0:33:06] <+FattimusSlime> Zinogre is a new model
[0:33:08] <+Pars_Librum> @PatStaresAt So speaking of the "HDness" of World. Are you assuming that the PC release of Rise is still going to look worse than World?
[0:33:10] <%BoxNavy> Kreygasm
[0:33:11] <$RealThiele> RE engine is a workhorse
[0:33:12] <skagtheprinceofhell> Unless they fuck up the port again
[0:33:12] <blackbookalpha> And new Nintendo servers
[0:33:15] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> cant wait for that pc release
[0:33:15] <jorniev> WILL THE HD MONSTERS CARRY OVER IN THE FUTURE?
[0:33:15] <Jashter18> Almost like MH Team knows how yo future proof unlike some other devs
[0:33:15] <bear_breaker20> gotta hunt them alll
[0:33:18] <+abrupt_abe> Doesn't it sing on Switch anyway?
[0:33:19] <+Catpurnicus> yeah I'm waiting for steam
[0:33:20] <PanicSwytch> Production for rise started when icebourne came out
[0:33:20] <+GrandmasterBFunk> It runs crazy good on Switch, the RE Engine is amazing
[0:33:21] <+Shishi1205> @PatStaresAt Actually Zinogre design is different, looks more like old world zinogre rather than new world (MHW)
[0:33:21] <%YakumoYomi> MT Framework was old and busted
[0:33:24] <aqua_mashu> very excited for 2022
[0:33:24] <%neroforte177> @BettyMwwaahh with the Japanese aesthetic prolly
[0:33:26] <ExistentialSteak> Does rise have the SoS system like MHW?
[0:33:28] <penitentpendant> Please, PLEASE have them work on their netcode.
[0:33:30] <OneThousandTomatoes> its even gonna be able to run on my shitty pc
[0:33:37] <+TestAnon> I wonder how much they upgrade the graphics in the PC version
[0:33:43] <+TenKaiHunter> World 2 = more weapons?

[0:34:31] <bear_breaker20> yo me too!! Kappa
[0:34:32] <%zeroarturia> Thank you for being a friend!!!
[0:34:33] <PortableBoredom> Laughtracks hit a part of my brain that doesn't like being hit.
[0:34:33] <skagtheprinceofhell> I thought it was older.
[0:34:34] <penitentpendant> Good writing can be TIMELESS
[0:34:35] <radiosanchezz> i've played 20 hours of the game through nefarious means, and i can say the game is sooooooo much fun and all the weapons feel amazing
[0:34:36] <red_fox_zero> Are you a Blanch?
[0:34:36] <Devbob98> I can’t believe you haven’t watch it yet
[0:34:36] <%Lion_kun> They're all dead except Betty White
[0:34:36] <+seiyaofabyss> and one of them is STILL LAIVE
[0:34:38] <+froduck42> did you know the guy who wrote the theme song for golden girls also wrote spooky scary skeletons?
[0:34:39] <%solracc25> That party died long ago
[0:34:40] <VirtuaRailith> I hate being as old as Pat.
[0:34:41] <+seiyaofabyss> ALIVE*
[0:34:42] <+thelonechris> Remember when Rose fucked a guy to death?
[0:34:42] <TheAlmostBlind> I'm going to things like Bleach, Saint Seiya and One Oiec lol
[0:34:44] <%Jamejarrs> Are you a Blanche, Sophia, Rose, or Dorothy?
[0:34:45] <%pearsnickety> World 2 I would say is likely the game to introduce more weapons to keep the new crowd entertained. Fingers crossed for boomerangs.
[0:34:45] <%chance_h> Who’s best girl?
[0:34:45] <%miguelrod777> LUL
[0:34:49] <blackbookalpha> haha
[0:34:51] <KaiserMario> Those bones are cold already, that's how old that show is
[0:34:53] <%twoto858> @PatStaresAt Considering how much of a dinosaur Nintendo is, do you think that data transfers from Switch to PC will happen?
[0:34:53] <ScreamLord> The actress that played Sophia was the youngest in the group BTW
[0:34:56] <$RealThiele> betty white has absorbed power from the rest
[0:34:57] <%Starotter70> Hell ye
[0:34:57] <+froduck42> fortnut
[0:34:58] <%BoxNavy> thats enough kh
[0:35:00] <%Ne1son> wait really
[0:35:01] <OneThousandTomatoes> my condolences
[0:35:01] <%Agami23> and can you describe the plot?
[0:35:03] <dereksbales> betty white is 99
[0:35:05] <Ultimatefool> Yeah but can you try out KH please
[0:35:06] <%BoxNavy> 3 is terrible
[0:35:06] <%MrBorisMakarov> STREAM IT THO
[0:35:06] <%ClericOfSparda> Kingdom Hearts LP when?
[0:35:07] <PortableBoredom> The finish line is when you get the Ultima Weapon you coward.
[0:35:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat is a Sophia
[0:35:08] <blackbookalpha> Pat a true Tetsuya Nomura fan
[0:35:08] <+JudeKnight14> 2 is the best one
[0:35:10] <+CookieCutter007> Pat doesn't like card games
[0:35:10] <%the38bandit> betty white still alive right?'
[0:35:11] <penitentpendant> Fair for skipping the portables
[0:35:12] <%cache_22> Playing KH doesn't count unless you play it on stream.
[0:35:12] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Yeah, that's enough
[0:35:12] <+Tigeroovy> I'm curious to actually watch Golden Girls sometime, I remember it on TV growing up but as a kid I had no interest in a show about 4 old ladies. But I'm sure it's actually very good.
[0:35:13] <Louie_Salmon> Well there you go
[0:35:14] <%Starotter70> Now it's DDD
[0:35:17] <Mattais88> yep
[0:35:17] <yourliteraldog> Norted
[0:35:17] <+seiyaofabyss> You never played 3?
[0:35:17] <%BoxNavy> it sure is
[0:35:18] <+alphonseisbest> THAT DOESN'T COUNT
[0:35:19] <%Starotter70> IT IS
[0:35:19] <+GrandmasterBFunk> yeah
[0:35:19] <$Dakuu75> agreed
[0:35:19] <+TheBitingIrish> @pearsnickety 4U's giant boomerang concept Kreygasm
[0:35:20] <%twoto858> Yeah that's right

[0:35:26] <%ExpressNode> It's the only one Kappa
[0:35:26] <+alphonseisbest> yea
[0:35:27] <%YakumoYomi> BBS is my favorite, though
[0:35:28] <+FancyFishies> I'm not sure if that explains anything pat
[0:35:28] <frostyjay3> Dream Drop Distance was meh

[0:35:38] <radiosanchezz> do you guys remember what happened the last time a kingdom hearts lp happened?
[0:35:40] <%blastyoboots> Chain of Memories was pretty fun
[0:35:41] <+TenKaiHunter> But that phone game tho....
[0:35:41] <%TubeMan642> KH3 is fun
[0:35:42] <%Agami23> KH2 holds up even now
[0:35:43] <%MidnightBurst12> kh2 stream when
[0:35:44] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah it just got too complicated
[0:35:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I will never be able to take that series seriously holy shit
[0:35:44] <Warbot40> KH2 is still great. KH3 is okay with dlc.
[0:35:45] <SharpestEnsign> yup
[0:35:47] <FrostyKaze> Damn right  it is
[0:35:47] <%Wulfphelz> Two will never be topped
[0:35:48] <+FancyFishies> 3 is garbo
[0:35:48] <+hatok> 3's DLC is some of the best boss fights in the franchise
[0:35:48] <frostyjay3> KH II fucking rules
[0:35:49] <Aydarkzero> it's monster hunting time!
[0:35:50] <%BoxNavy> yea

[0:35:52] <+FancyFishies> too easy
[0:35:53] <+GrandmasterBFunk> 3 Has improoved, but like, 2 is probably the best PS2 game ever
[0:35:53] <OneThousandTomatoes> yes
[0:35:56] <%NoirePanzer> 3 has DMC animation cancels with item use now so I mean
[0:35:56] <BiologicGases> 2 the huge gap 1 lol

[0:35:59] <%MugenSandan> BIG CORRECT
[0:36:00] <+JudeKnight14> 3 comes pretty close
[0:36:00] <penitentpendant> Aw ball, 5.5 is in april
[0:36:02] <%twoto858> @twoto858 I didn't even know that! Thanks for the info
[0:36:03] <Cynical2DD> Kingdom Hearts 1 should only be played on the hard difficulty
[0:36:03] <Vaunno> KH II goated
[0:36:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> I only played CoM and 3. 3 felt like the most lackluster letdown ever.
[0:36:06] <+Metrick_92> KH2 still holds up imo and I hate Kongdom Hearts
[0:36:09] <%BoxNavy> endwalker aint droppin till the fall my man

[1:01:18] <jcflyguy> Oh wow not SnS
[1:01:19] <+AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Katana is local flavour after all.
[1:01:19] <OmnipotentTrevor> Sword and shield isn't nearly as Japanese
[1:01:20] <%Monkeyweed21> Dango? how dreadful
[1:01:20] <+Geograffy> Embrace the way of the weeb
[1:01:21] <yourliteraldog> Hunting Horn Gang
[1:01:21] <FlamingNarwhal> long sword fits the japan look more

[1:01:26] <%WhereIsWill> weeb sword lets goo
[1:01:26] <+TestAnon> Long sword is the teacher's pet this game
[1:01:28] <ScreamLord> Because the LS is the REAL noob weapon
[1:01:28] <%captain_thickthighs> they finally learned no one likes sword and shield
[1:01:28] <simifu> sword and shield in japan theme land? why would they do that
[1:01:29] <waffleandman> it is the easiest weapon

[1:13:37] <+TheBitingIrish> @YakumoYomi Owls are popular as pets in Japan, I believe
[1:13:42] <+MisterAvry> all at once
[1:13:43] <+Dova573> My Hunter out here singing baka mitai while looking at a picture of Guild Marm
[1:13:49] <simifu> they also play Dark souls 2 for 2 years straight
[1:13:50] <dan_g_v> I miss Neko (it means Cat)
[1:13:58] <BiologicGases> no scoutflies just big red arrow
[1:14:00] <Giztech> did you just get a new armor set?
[1:14:01] <Reisadan> Palico with that gangster kneel
[1:14:03] <%FacetiousAF> SourPls but at a respectful speed
[1:14:04] <FlamingNarwhal> never liked guild marm very much tbh
[1:14:06] <%AzureGale> Unlocked the Influencer Bribe Pack
[1:14:06] <%logoth_> Moooo (moo means moo)
[1:14:07] <iosephe> holy shit yes
[1:14:11] <kyong_few> People believe owls are wise but in reality they are actually quite dimwitted
[1:14:13] <+adelym0> pat do we know if this game has the same shitass deco system that world did
[1:14:16] <%Monkeyweed21> PET THE DOG

[1:14:35] <%barkon345> @adelym0 no you get to craft decos in this game
[1:14:36] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> AEUG_Ace_Kamille subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 36 months! 
[1:14:40] <+Shishi1205> @patstaresat  btw heads up, don't need to use kiranico anymore, the game has hitzone values of the monsters and also drop %. At last wikis are not necessary
[1:14:40] <SpiffySmithy_> Decorations are craftable again in Rise
[1:14:42] <WeebFever> @adelym0 Nope! Decos are craftable again! (but charms are more RNG random than ever)
[1:14:44] <%the22cstomp> this hub theme absolutely slaps
[1:14:49] <+MisterAvry> k I've reach my limit for over-weebery. have fun everyone!

[1:16:07] <+AWr00tBear> You’ll probably have to go to the training room to configure all your options. Like FOV and auto sheath
[1:16:11] <$Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt what's worse, the "mew" puns or speaking with "rrrrrreally" roalling R's?

[1:21:10] <%AzureGale> DO COMBO
[1:21:10] <Aydarkzero> that's a big bug

[1:21:24] <DasFreekman> YESSSSS good as training room
[1:21:28] <%TrafficCohen> @PatStaresAt For hunting, great wirebugs are an item you use
[1:21:29] <lets_be_friendos> that's alotta shut on screen
[1:21:33] <Sotetsu> I have never been able to get past the tutorial in MH games. They are just so long.
[1:21:39] <BiologicGases> does anyone know if the moveset will stay on screen in hunts?
[1:21:39] <ergulor> Knife dog
[1:21:43] <+sixcubit> pat's leaving the voices on? he's a stronger man then i
[1:21:46] <LordOfThePoultry> oh no the voices

[1:21:56] <FlamingNarwhal> wait wait wai
[1:21:58] <rReizs> there's a tutorial? i just run straight to quests
[1:22:02] <BlueSpartan119> @BiologicGases no I don't believe it does
[1:22:04] <%barkon345> you can make the statue attack you
[1:22:04] <%the22cstomp> is it just me or is the eng voice acting cool
[1:22:05] <FlamingNarwhal> can you turn hunter voices off???
[1:22:07] <simifu> did you customize your voice?
[1:22:09] <jcflyguy> Can you disable/turn down hunter callouts?
[1:22:09] <%Broand> Can't wait to get my gunlance rockin
[1:22:10] <%AzureGale> The palamute is Repede on steroids
[1:22:12] <Aydarkzero> this game has an fov also?
[1:22:22] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @rReizs this is the training room
[1:22:26] <OneThousandTomatoes> pat you mentioned you like the voice lines right?
[1:22:33] <Srthunda> can you turn hunter voices up?
[1:22:37] <dan_g_v> armored
[1:22:40] <+RoeDeerRootie> @jcflyguy I believe so
[1:22:42] <Aydarkzero> this is a good training room
[1:22:45] <%tusk102> that's rad!
[1:22:48] <%Cykron> Fine Pat but have you considered Zoidberg?
[1:22:51] <FlamingNarwhal> ill be so glad if you can turn hunter voice off cause that means i dont have to switch to Japanese to ignore them
[1:22:51] <%AzureGale> Heh, "hard" bit
[1:23:05] <BiologicGases> @BiologicGases oof thanks its not for me just i know some people who liked it
[1:23:05] <rReizs> yeah but its a training dummy not "how to play"
[1:23:09] <Aydarkzero> practice your sleep bombing distance LUL
[1:23:12] <$JojoPiero> or a percentile
[1:23:12] <OneThousandTomatoes> @azuregale thats so low hanging fruit
[1:23:14] <simifu> meh it needed the SF4 background for the training room
[1:23:17] <%tusk102> god this training room is so much better than worlds
[1:23:20] <%Cykron> LONGSWORD
[1:23:22] <+TestAnon> boooooooooo
[1:23:23] <Saltmeisterr> YEAH WEEB
[1:23:24] <%BoxNavy> the poopsword
[1:23:24] <%FacetiousAF> pat nooooo
[1:23:24] <blackbookalpha> K-Tana
[1:23:25] <+blaze__drag> I mean for low rank that is a good bit of power
[1:23:25] <%BubbaRands> HAH! WEEB
[1:23:26] <LordOfThePoultry> COWARD
[1:23:28] <Ultimatefool> Does Power Sheathe only affect first Charged slash or all of them?
[1:23:32] <RaidenRising> weeb
[1:23:36] <lets_be_friendos> even though the director is a HH main
[1:23:39] <%AzureGale> @OneThousandTomatoes Heh, "low hanging" fruit :p
[1:23:44] <%Cykron> Monster Hunter Rise more like Metal Gear Rise
[1:23:55] <RedKrimzon> @rReizs yeah, and he's training lol
[1:23:57] <+AWr00tBear> Make that frog attack
[1:24:00] <+blaze__drag> like that's an 8% power increase, if that remains true that'll be super great at high/g rank
[1:24:02] <BinaryShuffle> longsword booooo, don't lump us weebs with longsword users stripMad
[1:24:12] <simifu> are we gonna spend an hour here? monkaS
[1:24:13] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[1:24:13] <DasFreekman> I was so sad the cart from the iceborne demo never made it to the training room
[1:24:16] <FlamingNarwhal> big counter
[1:24:17] <LoreKeeper_Thal> big counte
[1:24:18] <%BoxNavy> after the roundslash you can use special sheathe with zr+b
[1:24:18] <nakpack> iai slash from iceborne is here too
[1:24:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> ls is a counter weapon
[1:24:23] <+AWr00tBear> Go to training room options
[1:24:31] <RaidenRising> virgil shit
[1:24:41] <$JojoPiero> @DasFreekman The big Monster Cart in the Training room?
[1:24:54] <%Deft_Thought> Does the meter build on Longsword work the same?
[1:24:55] <%debugdrawray_> oh holy shit
[1:24:58] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:25:00] <+OneTrueAsshat> how is fps on switch?
[1:25:01] <%debugdrawray_> that fucking rules
[1:25:04] <rusell4> I'm late. Pat hear about the greatness that is Melty Blood?
[1:25:09] <jcflyguy> Dosukoi
[1:25:10] <%demiiluna> How great is it that the training dummy is a big Karakuri monster
[1:25:11] <Ner234> We labbing now?
[1:25:23] <DiagunAquila> counter
[1:25:24] <+GrandmasterBFunk> that counter window is enourmouse
[1:25:25] <+MacDatAss> can you cart to the training dummy?
[1:25:28] <blackbookalpha> counter
[1:25:29] <Ultimatefool> White gauge
[1:25:38] <%YakumoYomi> Counter that gives white gauge
[1:25:39] <$Dakuu75> I wish MHW had this kind of training. we use to ignite the bomb and try to parry the explosion
[1:25:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> both wirebugs
[1:25:56] <FlamingNarwhal> its a counter. bigger damage you counter bigger damage it does. also the counter window is HUUUUGE
[1:26:06] <rReizs> @rReizs some guy was talking about how complex the tutorial is, learning to hit things by yourself isn't the tutorial
[1:26:10] <blackbookalpha> Does this have Spirit Helmbreaker yet?
[1:26:18] <AoiRob> wait you can vergil in mh??
[1:26:20] <OkamiDude15> @rusell4 he'd probably dunk on it as per the usual but im sure woolie and reggie will check it out
[1:26:21] <+jofrankii> zr during sheathe
[1:26:22] <simifu> elmo's getting messed up LUL
[1:26:25] <%ExpressNode> Special seth
[1:26:26] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt why does the longsword lose sharpness so fast? Also the counter works on damage taken. bigger damage taken=bigger damage dealt
[1:26:35] <YakumoYomi> Helmbreaker is a Silkbind attack, I think
[1:26:38] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> After 500 hours in World, I could use one weapon correctly.
[1:26:41] <LoreKeeper_Thal> because at lost of hits
[1:26:44] <+blaze__drag> cause hit fast
[1:26:45] <blackbookalpha> ok good to know
[1:26:48] <rufus2k2> >english dub
[1:26:50] <Vendigear> "In World, the fade slash was too strong as a counter, so we nerfed it" *adds special sheathe*
[1:26:53] <rufus2k2> turn on the simlish!
[1:26:53] <%Garthunox> its accurate, cos katanas are pieces of shit
[1:26:59] <ScreamLord> Because it's a basic ass lvl1 iron LS?
[1:27:03] <OneThousandTomatoes> cause katanas were shitty swords
[1:27:04] <Ultimatefool> @tusk102 Well it is only at yellow sharpness
[1:27:07] <%Garthunox> @rufus2k2 ok simaboo
[1:27:08] <TrollKing96> Are we ever going to get info on the monster's health value given that we have damage numbers now?
[1:27:14] <DiagunAquila> need meter
[1:27:16] <%Cykron> I AM THE STORM THAT IS APPROACHING
[1:27:17] <nakpack> it is a counter
[1:27:23] <+jofrankii> it's a tight window
[1:27:26] <Vendigear> we are never getting health
[1:27:28] <%Taisuru> It is, gotta time it
[1:27:29] <rufus2k2> @Garthunox DAS RITE Kappa
[1:27:29] <%Monkeyweed21> need good timing
[1:27:35] <+blaze__drag> it's a really tight but powerful counter
[1:27:35] <ghoulspan> pat please stop button mashing and try to learn the combos
[1:27:37] <jumpyhugs> This training dummy is AMAZING
[1:27:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> at least when it came to durability
[1:27:40] <+SpaceHobo55> What do you mean now?
[1:27:40] <%baka_sugoi> frame 1?
[1:27:44] <FlamingNarwhal> @TrollKing96 probably not. tracking a monster's health based on its actions and the way it moves is a big part of MH
[1:27:44] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt new Hunting Horn feels like a Devil May Cry weapon
[1:27:45] <$JojoPiero> @TrollKing96 The Hunters Notes in this game are the most descriptive they've ever been. You won't need Kiranico
[1:27:46] <Aydarkzero> you'll get it once and look cool
[1:27:47] <%the22cstomp> just frame counters hell yeah
[1:27:52] <%bevyrage> You can buffer into it pat
[1:27:52] <%AzureGale> Pat can't handle tight spaces
[1:27:52] <BlueSpartan119> royal guard
[1:27:53] <%Taisuru> Start of the animation pat
[1:27:54] <simifu> yup we are spending hours here FeelsBadMan
[1:27:59] <+blaze__drag> the timing is like, right exactly when you draw is when you need to get hit
[1:27:59] <%Valdorick> Just dodge, 5head
[1:28:03] <Ner234> Dying to training dummy LUL
[1:28:04] <OneThousandTomatoes> the blue part is counter
[1:28:05] <$Dakuu75> nailed it
[1:28:07] <+bustawof> nice
[1:28:11] <%Cykron> SCUM
[1:28:11] <%BoxNavy> labbings part of the fun
[1:28:16] <+AWr00tBear> Do it again. You can see your glow blue that’s the counter
[1:28:18] <mrshazboto> What was that...like...5 frames?
[1:28:19] <%logoth_> Can palamutes talk?
[1:28:19] <rufus2k2> 5head, nah Pat's a Tenhead
[1:28:25] <follyofjolly> Right when that blue spark is when the counters work with weapons I've noticed.
[1:28:27] <%isolex_> easy mode is now selectable
[1:28:27] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the counter wirebug's damage increased depending on how much damage you take. so bigger damage taken by the wire shield=bigger damge to monster
[1:28:29] <+AWr00tBear> You got it
[1:28:31] <+The__Strongest> apparently the LS is super dependent on that one counter
[1:28:36] <rufus2k2> he's a teasing master even
[1:28:40] <FlamingNarwhal> @rufus2k2 nope they just woof and bark
[1:28:43] <$Dakuu75> you guys think it'll have cross play with PC when it comes out on that?
[1:28:46] <%Monkeyweed21> its in there
[1:28:52] <%newtype89> page three of the controls
[1:28:52] <%BoxNavy> no
[1:28:52] <DiagunAquila> no
[1:28:54] <OneThousandTomatoes> @logoth_ I think its more that they speak in meows but everyone can understand them
[1:28:58] <blackbookalpha> I think you CAN helmbreaker with the silkbind, just need meter
[1:29:08] <simifu> is pc even going to be a thing?
[1:29:14] <+AWr00tBear> For the helm splitter tap zR right after soaring Kick
[1:29:14] <FlamingNarwhal> @Dakuu75 no world still doesnt have crossplay
[1:29:16] <%YakumoYomi> @Dakuu75 Absolutely not
[1:29:17] <OneThousandTomatoes> pc in 2022
[1:29:22] <%BoxNavy> theyre serious
[1:29:25] <DiagunAquila> yeah pc is 2022

[1:29:27] <NeroIscariot12> @simifu next year yeah
[1:29:29] <FlamingNarwhal> pc confirmed in 2022
[1:29:31] <+D00msDayDan> yeah you can use wirebug to skip the lunging part
[1:29:34] <blackbookalpha> there you go
[1:29:42] <%MisterRockett> I like Long Sword. It's like Great Sword but faster.
[1:29:43] <+jofrankii> its crazy busted
[1:29:44] <%tusk102> The more damage you counter the more damage the counterattack does with that other wirebug thing
[1:29:46] <butthurtdave> Oh shit how long has Pat been streaming
[1:29:47] <%hermitsen> hermitsen subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 26 months! monhun get hype
[1:29:49] <BlueSpartan119> Rise LS is just Iceborne but better
[1:29:49] <$SGrim> Longsword = Strongsword
[1:29:57] <%YakumoYomi> Can you Special Sheath after Spirit Roundslash?
[1:30:00] <simifu> well, expect a rough pc port fellas. unless they learned from world
[1:30:08] <butthurtdave> I think it's still in the game as another silk bind art?
[1:30:08] <%Monkeyweed21> spirit thrust has been replaced by the kick
[1:30:08] <ASleepySnek> the lunge is gone
[1:30:17] <ASleepySnek> ^

[1:30:57] <$Dakuu75> keeping the combo going from helm breaker, to sheath, to continue attack was always fun as hell
[1:30:58] <+Dova573> LS is the same nice
[1:30:59] <%AzureGale> IF there is a PC port
[1:30:59] <RocketBarrel> I hope the PC port won't be behind a year like World PC was

[1:33:35] <+Shishi1205> @patstaresat tip so you don't waste time in online low rank, complete the village quests and high rank gets unlocked
[1:33:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> cool dog
[1:34:07] <OneThousandTomatoes> that's cool
[1:34:09] <+Shishi1205> @patstaresat  village is only low rank I think
[1:34:14] <+TheBitingIrish> I'll be upset if Palamutes don't get an Amaterasu costume

[1:43:42] <dexdestroyazz> wait, can i still fill my house-room with a bunch of freaky cactaurs?
[1:43:52] <+Shishi1205> @patstaresat fun fact there is now an endemic life blue bird that increases your quest rewards
[1:43:53] <+ShitLord> that killed so much time for me @follyofjolly
[1:43:58] <butthurtdave> I like the idea of the endemic stuff but having to devote the first five minutes of a hunt to scavenging the map for boosts kinda seems counterproductive
[1:44:03] <Whytemane> Is the game released, or is this the demo?
[1:44:05] <+jordy_j_s> you guys think rise is worth waiting for PC or nah?
[1:44:14] <blackbookalpha> and MONEY OWL
[1:44:19] <%BoxNavy> thank the lord
[1:44:23] <LordOfThePoultry> BOOOOOOOO
[1:44:25] <%psidefx> oh nice

[1:44:33] <+ShitLord> ill for sure wait for PC release
[1:44:35] <SpiffySmithy_> that's good cuz I like using every weapon
[1:44:37] <%the22cstomp> @Whytemane influencer copy
[1:44:40] <OneThousandTomatoes> @butthurtdave you get most of them by running by them
[1:44:48] <FlamingNarwhal> @jordy_j_s personally nah cause the fps/res increase doesnt matter to me much. but i also played all the DS monster hunter so im used to it
[1:44:48] <+the___moustache> This is by the Portable team so people can play it on trains and buses.
[1:44:50] <+TestAnon> toned down to craft, upgrading takes about the same I hear @patstaresat
[1:44:52] <dexdestroyazz> Any idea if theres gonna be crossplay with PC?
[1:44:53] <$Dakuu75> BLOOD
[1:44:54] <%BoxNavy> @jordy_j_s if you have the money just get it. no real sense in waiting
[1:44:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> ninja guy is a surfer bro

[1:45:23] <@JustinianKnight> 0 chance theres crossplay
[1:45:24] <EynosStyles> @dakuu75 I really feel like they where trying to make kakashi.
[1:45:28] <butthurtdave> Does changing the voice frequency affect people in multiplayer as well?
[1:45:30] <%BoxNavy> that noise is gone forever jermaPluto
[1:45:34] <+adelym0> aaagh the hunter voices
[1:45:36] <%AlteisenReiseZ> NOTHIN PERSONELL BUDDY
[1:45:37] <FlamingNarwhal> i REEAALY dont expect crossplay
[1:45:38] <follyofjolly> @ShitLord It made me want to fish WAY more, just to fill the aquarium up
[1:45:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> @butthurtdave yes
[1:45:40] <+adelym0> D:
[1:45:42] <FlamingNarwhal> world never even got it
[1:45:45] <$Dakuu75> @EynosStyles lol, seems like it, eh.
[1:45:45] <%debugdrawray_> im not even sure cross save will even make it in
[1:45:53] <wolfen091> haha you're here
[1:45:54] <+ShitLord> that fkin drift looks so bad because you can do it while going straight
[1:45:57] <%BoxNavy> crossplay aint happening even a one bit
[1:46:01] <FlamingNarwhal> @debugdrawray_ that DEFINITELY wont
[1:46:08] <simifu> I nothing personal'd my dinner today
[1:46:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> @butthurtdave actually its more that you can just turn multiplayer voices off entirely
[1:46:11] <+TheIntellectional> what a hero
[1:46:20] <+the___moustache> I hope we get more skills in updates. Not as crazy as GU though.
[1:46:22] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[1:46:22] <+Minorou> you saved the village!
[1:46:24] <gslayer14> can't say i'm a fan of the sound design
[1:46:28] <%AzureGale> Pat is da mastah
[1:46:36] <%AzureGale> Roll credits!
[1:46:40] <dan_g_v> hard work, but honest work
[1:46:44] <BiologicGases> wow cant believe you finished the game already
[1:46:47] <$realm_forge> Those lizards were the last of their species.......yay!
[1:46:48] <%debugdrawray_> its a shame, id buy both switch and pc if i could take my progress, but no way im restarting 400+ hr savefiles
[1:46:50] <%walternatorz> pat is the smartest and best hunter ever
[1:46:51] <butthurtdave> I really hope the endgame encourages a lot of different builds.  Everybody was running the same skills in World and it was so boring
[1:46:51] <@JustinianKnight> do you mean in game or for real
[1:46:56] <wolfen091> was gonna say, why does pat look hispanic
[1:46:58] <FlamingNarwhal> @PatStaresAt pre order layered armor doesnt have a helmet does it?
[1:47:00] <simifu> perfect for pat

[1:47:15] <%Broand> Looking forward to gunlancin
[1:47:16] <+the___moustache> The Eastern theme is really reminding me of Portable 3rd and I love it. Still my favorite game.
[1:47:17] <+EternalInquisitor> S-ranked the fuck outta that nothing
[1:47:21] <%walternatorz> do they have baseball caps?
[1:47:37] <+Kenzo2000> Why is Pat able to play this already? did he mess with the time on his switch?
[1:47:43] <thetruthofyourbeing> so this is only on switch?
[1:47:44] <$Dakuu75> this is some Okami-ass monster hunter. I dig it.
[1:47:46] <dexdestroyazz> Just imagine how this will run on the New(tm)NintendoSwitch(tm)
[1:47:46] <Discount_CJ> The real monster hunter rise was the friends we made along the way
[1:47:51] <+JakeOfalco> anyone reminded of nier?

[1:49:01] <+the___moustache> It looks like a better version of the Yukumo set.
[1:49:02] <%debugdrawray_> @Broand basically but its with specific armor, you cant just apply any armor as layered
[1:49:03] <Discount_CJ> Does this game have transmog?
[1:49:03] <FlamingNarwhal> @Broand its visual only armor sets so pretty much yee
[1:49:24] <dan_g_v> This is Pat after Zangied wakes hiim up in the morning, before he gets out of his Pajamas

[1:52:53] <LoreKeeper_Thal> Arena quests are good
[1:52:58] <+ShitLord> Diamond dogs can now be in MH too
[1:53:00] <%LeRouch_the_Rebel> Balan Wonderworld's final boss has a potentially seizure inducing effect that's broken and appears multiple times throughout the bossfight
[1:53:00] <+GrandmasterBFunk> it runs at a more solid framerate than world did on base ps4
[1:53:00] <%BoxNavy> arena quests 🤢
[1:53:03] <+TheIntellectional> I hate arena with every fiber of my being
[1:53:03] <FlamingNarwhal> yeeeeeah

[1:53:14] <dan_g_v> well, world was in an inferior consoles anyways

[1:53:19] <Zombrocom> Eh, I had a rock solid locked 60 on world, on PC
[1:53:22] <butthurtdave> Fighting Lunastra turned my PC into a fukkin space heater
[1:53:26] <+the___moustache> I wouldn't mind Arena quests if they scaled to 1 player.
[1:53:26] <%Monkeyweed21> but you have to do 20 arena quests to get the best in class long sword/lance
[1:53:26] <%Taisuru> Solid 30 > 60 Max

[1:53:43] <PanicSwytch> Has Pat done any hunts?
[1:53:46] <butthurtdave> Yeah the load times on this are infinitely better than World's load times on console

[1:59:56] <+Big_Hudson> @FlamingNarwhal really?? thats awesome
[1:59:57] <Vendigear> and that's saying something, they added a ton of nonsense
[2:00:02] <butthurtdave> I do kinda miss the clutch claw due to the weakening/softening stuff, but yeah this is way cooler
[2:00:02] <%BubbaRands> Arzuros good Honey Badger
[2:00:04] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt did you kill a magnamalo?
[2:00:04] <FlamingNarwhal> its mounting but actually interesting
[2:00:06] <dan_g_v> Use a Rathian to hit a Magnamalo, to hit a Mizutsune to hit a Magnamalo to hit a Rathian
[2:00:06] <%FacetiousAF> who had "war bears" on their bingo card
[2:00:21] <+Shishi1205> @patstaresat  Oh fun fact, Rajang is MH Rises invader monster in high rank

[2:00:29] <AoiRob> YEET
[2:00:31] <winner_92> i used the monster to kill the monster
[2:00:31] <simifu> why was I imagining a monster yeet?
[2:00:32] <blackbookalpha> If Bazelgeuse is in the game can you do a bombing run when riding it? lol
[2:00:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> try some attacks while holding back
[2:00:45] <butthurtdave> Right, I forgot that it anchors the monster to the ground for a bit
[2:00:53] <%joodatious> mounting was still fun after iceborn but this is obviously way more fun
[2:00:55] <jorniev> I WISH THIS WAS POKEMON
[2:01:04] <@SoFarFetched> @Discount_CJ I say its on par, MonHun world when it came out did about 5-6 million on PS4,and when DQ11 came out,also did around the  same numbers.
[2:01:04] <OneThousandTomatoes> holding back shoukd give differnt attacks
[2:01:08] <dan_g_v> so it has normal and specials along with Supers?
[2:01:09] <+Fiiib> skin the pokemon
[2:01:19] <%Monkeyweed21> Directions give different attack
[2:01:21] <%joodatious> the best thing about monster hunter is that is just gets better for the most part so you dont gotta be mad when it just improves off the last one
[2:01:26] <AoiRob> make the bear do a stinger
[2:01:26] <dan_g_v> oh that counter was so anime!

[2:01:51] <DonHindiJohn> Monster moveset lab
[2:01:52] <+Shishi1205> don't forget to tilt the control back + attack to get different attacks
[2:01:53] <+GrandmasterBFunk> @butthurtdave i hated the softening mechanic tbh, it added another thing you needed to do to be efficient
[2:01:54] <%ShitLord> i cant WAIT for this to come out on PC
[2:01:55] <BlueSpartan119> I hope we get a wyvern ride only event quest

[2:02:41] <LoreKeeper_Thal> IT WAS SO DUMB
[2:02:42] <$Dakuu75> I liked flinch shotting monsters intop walls and other monsters though
[2:02:42] <rufus2k2> also the lack of OOOOOOOOOOOHs
[2:02:44] <penitentpendant> "Oh thank god! I'm being invaded by a Rajang! Wait."
[2:02:45] <%joodatious> i felt bad because i was thinking why pat made his character so ugly then remembered he always makes himself

[2:03:21] <+Calamity2007> @Monkeyweed21 That would be interesting. I imagine it would probably be an armor skill

[2:03:26] <%Monkeyweed21> wtf this loads faster than Iceborne on PS4

[2:11:32] <OkamiDude15> folded over 10 thousand times that steel is
[2:11:33] <Oxybe> you could always buy the base tho
[2:11:35] <andimustmask> do you have to mag-feed them after purchasing them?
[2:11:35] <+Calamity2007> Starter weapons are already cooler cooking than most weapons in world WTF
[2:11:35] <FlamingNarwhal> u can i world too pat

[2:11:39] <%Monkeyweed21> still need to upgrade them in the tree
[2:11:40] <Fabzzster> o no more bug food and upgrade?

[2:11:44] <josemoya95> You bought them in world too, then upgraded
[2:11:47] <dan_g_v> @JakeOfalco seems they have a classic look
[2:11:51] <FlamingNarwhal> you could always buy base kinsects
[2:11:52] <spawnzie> no you just need higher level glaives
[2:11:53] <blackbookalpha> Folded 10,000 times to fit in your inventory
[2:11:53] <%BoxNavy> you dont upgrade kinsects now you just buy them
[2:11:57] <follyofjolly> Only the base starters which has been that way for a while
[2:12:01] <%BoxNavy> no kinsect upgrading whatsoever now

[2:25:21] <butthurtdave> This endemic stuff is weird
[2:25:24] <follyofjolly> It also kinda makes sense, there's a poison toad nearby that area. So why not a anti-poison snake
[2:25:28] <dan_g_v> Nature sounds soo good
[2:25:30] <+Grayhammatter> did it say those cobras actually cause poison as well?

[2:26:12] <MyNameIsRasus> is this only on switch or will it come to other shit? looks dope
[2:26:14] <%stickygumbolee> But when can you romance the monster?
[2:26:20] <garbageheaphound> So you have a bird, a cat, and a dog?
[2:26:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> does paige have any interest in mh?

[2:26:56] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah nintendo paid for the exclusivity for monhun on Switch
[2:26:58] <%TamsynRRD> QWorld was clunky because its engine was held together with bubble gum, paper clips and hope.
[2:26:59] <%BoxNavy> 1
[2:26:59] <wierus> I wish this would come out on PC sooner
[2:27:04] <+Grayhammatter> these quips are so silly, i love it

[2:27:56] <wierus> @hrbeck_ yeah but not until 2022
[2:28:01] <follyofjolly> What kinda sucks is I know a friend whose going to complain about that one hit mining thing

[2:28:53] <%ssjklyco> Yet,  your friend will probably still buy and play this for hours
[2:28:55] <%Mythicalbrit> Your friend is the reason red dead is the way it is

[2:31:21] <dan_g_v> short cut area?
[2:31:22] <MyNameIsRasus> feels very dense
[2:31:23] <%Mythicalbrit> I'd be ok if he talked like 10-30% of the time but every time will drive me nuts
[2:31:27] <butthurtdave> I wonder if you can monster mount one into that area and completely fuck them over
[2:31:28] <%FlamingNarwhal> @boardscanada pat's real dog is named zangief
[2:31:31] <dan_g_v> hey this  is the trailer area!

[2:31:40] <follyofjolly> But now he's just as hammy as everything else in MH
[2:31:42] <%BestTeaMaker> it feels like they designed maps for you to create routes to pick up buffs and items on the way to the monster
[2:31:43] <$realm_forge> Why is your character a 40 year chain smoker?
[2:31:46] <+Shishi1205> well monsters shoot you if you try to cheese them in those areas so that's how it's balanced

[2:35:48] <%Cykron> @PatStaresAt Would you consider this the Sekiro of Monster Hunter?
[2:35:49] <+Shishi1205> gorbs are objective points
[2:35:52] <spawnzie> the carving lines makes me wish there was an Arthur Morgan or John Marston type voice
[2:35:55] <+Shishi1205> @seraphile

[2:36:11] <dan_g_v> we have been exploring for half an hour and I just want to keep seeing more and more of this single map
[2:36:12] <butthurtdave> like character builds
[2:36:13] <@SoFarFetched> That's a weird comparison,plus isn't sekiro just parrying?
[2:36:17] <sweettalker_> more anime?
[2:36:18] <s1rcuit> I liked Sekiro
[2:36:22] <andimustmask> thems fightin words

[2:36:25] <%Master_Van> Master_Van subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! 
[2:36:29] <andimustmask> i'd say sekiro is plenty interesting
[2:36:29] <blackbookalpha> ride dog, sharpen on the go
[2:36:30] <Zombrocom> Sekiro is a different beast
[2:36:30] <+GrandmasterBFunk> I did not care for Sekiro
[2:36:30] <boardscanada> the Japan setting is more interesting than World
[2:36:30] <koffeemancer> *throw
[2:36:31] <MyNameIsRasus> i really hope elden ring has a jump button
[2:36:32] <%코코꾸라> Was that Sekiro slander?
[2:36:33] <+BusterRepukken> the dmc5 of monster hunter

[2:36:46] <%FlamingNarwhal> @alphonseisbest except for sword oils
[2:36:48] <spawnzie> except ceadeus, that one gets cut
[2:36:50] <butthurtdave> Imagine if Elden Ring is another Sekiro with no character building
[2:36:52] <Vendigear> @alphonseisbest THEN WHERE IS MY SWIMMING
[2:36:57] <Zombrocom> You can do a free airdash after a wirebug
[2:37:01] <%hrbeck_> Is this after world? or a prequel?
[2:37:04] <%Cykron> The Persona 5 Strikers of Monster Hunter, if you will

[2:37:22] <kamenspidey> elden ring is the sekiro of dark souls
[2:37:25] <blackbookalpha> blinded by OLED bug
[2:37:25] <boardscanada> might be the first Switch game in a long time I buy again after the last game I bought in 2017
[2:37:27] <butthurtdave> oh god look at how bright and shiny those item drops are
[2:37:28] <EynosStyles> aim for the horns
[2:37:29] <$Dakuu75> throw the NET at their head to break the HORNS
[2:37:35] <+Grayhammatter> nice, a horn
[2:37:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pokemon is the peepee in Monhun's coke
[2:37:39] <%hrbeck_> @FlamingNarwhal they are, but go on
[2:37:39] <%FlamingNarwhal> @butchi1025 rock steady 30. pats expressed a lot of times how impressive it is
[2:37:40] <elicoy> I feel like wirebugs will be a Rise only thing. Feels very local

[2:40:38] <BlueSpartan119> the new equipment box is so much better
[2:40:39] <dan_g_v> maybe it's weapon based?
[2:40:42] <wierus> the dog just goes ham during combat
[2:40:44] <BlueSpartan119> buddy board maybe?
[2:40:44] <%solracc25> no red

[2:41:01] <+xendless_xurbia> I'm so sad this is only on switch where I refuse to pay for horrible online this is hurting my resolve
[2:41:03] <spawnzie> it's the posts with the doggy head on it
[2:41:07] <+RealPT1> I think it depends on weapon
[2:41:07] <+blastazoid00> Music Kreygasm
[2:41:09] <%Cykron> Hell yeah time for a real weapon
[2:41:12] <%cylish> this music has a kinda combo 14/nier vibe.

[2:41:36] <$Dakuu75> for MHW were you able to move your character from consol to PC? or no?
[2:41:36] <+NerevaRising> Do the other MH games have music like this?
[2:41:40] <dan_g_v> ninja scarf is always pretty good
[2:41:40] <%BoxNavy> did you get Real Dog?
[2:41:47] <spawnzie> it's in palamute gear

[2:42:02] <%Cykron> wasn't sword and shield OP in world? I'm new to this stuff
[2:42:10] <+Grayhammatter> jesus
[2:42:10] <wierus> monster hunter is such a great franchise
[2:42:11] <%demiiluna> This music kind of gives me Nier vibes
[2:42:15] <+Shishi1205> @patstaresat  seems like one of the new monsters that's coming with chameleos is apex rathalos for the rampage quests
[2:42:16] <%solracc25> pet armor
[2:42:17] <andimustmask> oh sweet jesus is GENs cat management again

[2:42:49] <rReizs> essence of dung bomb
[2:43:00] <s1rcuit> the bgm sounds like something that'd play during the end credits
[2:43:00] <$Dakuu75> @Cykron I mean, to say one weapon was more OP than another is kinda wrong, imo. it all depends on the situation and what you wanna do. there's no bad-weapon.
[2:43:05] <+Grayhammatter> yes, yes you are
[2:43:25] <outsidedoubtside> artful dodger is clearly a yakuza reference and now a charles dickens thing
[2:43:31] <+Alpacarok> So how is this compared to world?
[2:43:35] <+shadoke> Isnt Artful Dodger a character in Oliver Twist?
[2:43:40] <andimustmask> dissmissing cats in gen and 4u was made as heartwrenching as possible
[2:43:43] <%Cykron> @Dakuu75 Tell that to /v/ lol

[2:44:33] <terrorengine> dude, thats a dope hat
[2:44:38] <DarkestDom> calebBruh
[2:44:40] <%FlamingNarwhal> @jofrankii yes
[2:44:43] <andimustmask> @jofrankii yes
[2:44:45] <spawnzie> SnS is so fuckin fun now
[2:44:51] <+Shishi1205> only for ramapages tho
[2:44:57] <%Cykron> It kicks ass is what it does
[2:44:59] <+TheIntellectional> its an extremely fussy guard point
[2:45:00] <Blank9> sns rules
[2:45:02] <%Tallie> Tallie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 32 months! 
[2:45:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Will this come out on pc
[2:45:12] <andimustmask> sns combo's back, good to see
[2:45:12] <wierus> @spawnzie SNS isn't just constant flying head bashes?
[2:45:14] <%Cykron> Ew a leftie
[2:45:14] <+The__Strongest> that stab has some weight to it
[2:45:15] <%Readytoeat> Readytoeat subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! time sure flies by
[2:45:15] <+Akizea> Jesus sns is crazy too
[2:45:15] <+Grayhammatter> oh, they kept that
[2:45:15] <%FlamingNarwhal> @Shishi1205 wait... chameleos is rampage only??
[2:45:19] <Aydarkzero> oh yeah SnS time
[2:45:19] <Blank9> perfect rush totally has dragon's dogma animations in it
[2:45:19] <Vendigear> what
[2:45:22] <follyofjolly> Parry, if you time it right you get a full charge leap back attack instantly from what I read. COULD be wrong but I know its a gaurd point
[2:45:23] <%FlamingNarwhal> @doc_ock_rokc confirmed for pc in 2022
[2:45:25] <Vendigear> what the what
[2:45:26] <BlueSpartan119> perfect rush is the best
[2:45:27] <boardscanada> better combat than Souls LOL
[2:45:27] <framewindowcleaner> How's Pat liking the game?
[2:45:33] <AllenDeadman> no oil needed, we got combos
[2:45:35] <%solracc25> doge combo
[2:45:35] <+Shishi1205> no, apex rathalos is rampage only
[2:45:46] <Blank9> you can perfect rush straight out of guard slash
[2:45:47] <Aquatic_Lotus> @patstaresat You can press a in midair to stall yourself in the air as well as jump without using a wirebug point
[2:45:50] <%FlamingNarwhal> @Shishi1205 aaaaah okay that makes more sense
[2:45:51] <Blank9> and guard slash has a guard point on it now
[2:45:52] <+Shishi1205> he is coming in the April update
[2:45:53] <dan_g_v> do combo
[2:45:54] <blackbookalpha> no oil, I think there's coatings later?
[2:45:58] <%Cykron> Dog is trying his best
[2:45:59] <+Grayhammatter> dog do combo
[2:46:13] <inpaladin> @blackbookalpha whaaaaat
[2:46:15] <blackbookalpha> secret tunnel
[2:46:25] <+Shishi1205> coatings are for bow
[2:46:26] <+MisterTylerrr> SECRET TUNNELLLLL
[2:46:31] <framewindowcleaner> Hey chat, is Pat liking the game so far?
[2:46:32] <+NeonLight> through the mountain
[2:46:32] <dan_g_v> they ranked your jump, badass!
[2:46:32] <andimustmask> throguh the mountain
[2:46:33] <Blank9> there's no oil
[2:46:33] <+Grayhammatter> oh?
[2:46:34] <+Shishi1205> sns oils are gone
[2:46:39] <spawnzie> sonic rings
[2:46:40] <blackbookalpha> @inpaladin don't quote me on that lol
[2:46:44] <%solracc25> Secret tunell
[2:46:45] <Blank9> sns is stupid KO damage now with shield combo
[2:46:49] <+jofrankii> good
[2:46:50] <wierus> I'm glad to see the zones are still super large and open
[2:46:57] <Aydarkzero> nice
[2:46:57] <Aquatic_Lotus> You can press a in midair to stall yourself in the air as well as jump without using a wirebug point
[2:47:01] <+DrGlendale> Watching dog do combo while I cut grass in bravely  default 2 because it won't stop giving me huge lootl sbfpRichard
[2:47:18] <follyofjolly> We will likely never get coatings back but they gave back the round slash with RIDONK i-frames as a wire move
[2:47:23] <+Grayhammatter> spider-manning around
[2:47:24] <+RealPT1> stam oil was the GOAT
[2:47:30] <+Shishi1205> I member
[2:47:30] <follyofjolly> get oils back*
[2:47:36] <blackbookalpha> nvm yeah its just bow for coatings
[2:47:37] <dan_g_v> ah mah gawd, you don't have to stand up, mah gawd
[2:47:40] <%Cykron> This game seems a lot more accessible
[2:47:42] <+Shishi1205> are farming sets usable anymore
[2:47:52] <+RealPT1> SnS became a hammer with stam oil
[2:47:56] <butthurtdave> dont forget crouching speeding up carving time
[2:47:59] <Blank9> I never liked oils for sns because fuck more consumables
[2:48:03] <inpaladin> honestly surprised with all of the gen stuff in this game that we didn't get oils back
[2:48:04] <dan_g_v> burd
[2:48:18] <rReizs> yeah they take up inventory space
[2:48:20] <+TheBitingIrish> Oils were busted AF
[2:48:27] <%FlamingNarwhal> @Blank9 same here lol. same reason i dont like the ranged weapons
[2:48:30] <+Shishi1205> I remember having to crouch to carve jhen Moran so you didn't miss any carve
[2:48:31] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:48:34] <boardscanada> did you have a dog you can ride on in World too?
[2:48:35] <wierus> D:
[2:48:38] <%BoxNavy> you love that piece of shit on the floor
[2:48:42] <WeebFever> hell yeah points
[2:48:45] <blackbookalpha> elemental and status damage might be in for certain SnS weapons (confused it for coatings)
[2:48:50] <framewindowcleaner> Oils weren't busted at all, SNS has been mid tier since MHF1
[2:48:56] <%Cykron> Look at him scrawling out
[2:48:56] <butthurtdave> didnt sliding down ramps use stamina in World?
[2:49:02] <dan_g_v> and there's likely more shit on top of that tunnel
[2:49:22] <wierus> @boardscanada not a permanent pet dog that you could ride, but eventually you could ride some lesser monsters
[2:49:24] <dan_g_v> that felt heavy
[2:49:24] <+Shishi1205> Iceborne gave sns the sauce
[2:49:24] <%BoxNavy> @framewindowcleaner sns is oddly stupidly strong in iceborne
[2:49:35] <%Cykron> Walking up behind a raptor and stabbing it in the ass
[2:49:50] <+DrGlendale> would it be better if there were auto item pick ups if you already have a few of said item?
[2:49:52] <+TheBitingIrish> @Cykron Kappa
[2:50:02] <Blank9> it's pretty good here too
[2:50:09] <butthurtdave> best thing is that you still keep your dog in multiplayer with 4 people
[2:50:10] <framewindowcleaner> @BoxNavy But is it top tier stuff? Because being broken isn't the same as being great
[2:50:26] <Blank9> 3 hit shield combo -> spin slash -> backhop -> perfect rush
[2:50:27] <%solracc25> big monster where
[2:50:30] <Blank9> is too fun a loop
[2:50:31] <dan_g_v> oh we are here again
[2:50:35] <WeebFever> Payattentiontoyourstamina
[2:50:38] <dan_g_v> don't forget the bad cats
[2:50:53] <+Shishi1205> oh man, the stupid MHFU vespid queen and the other gajalaka like king were hard to hit
[2:50:53] <%BoxNavy> i mean sns wasnt outdamaging the guns but it was pushin big numbers
[2:51:05] <dan_g_v> tiny chicken turkey burd
[2:51:06] <butthurtdave> Can you turn off the interjections from other characters?
[2:51:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> why do you sound like a street shark
[2:51:23] <+Kiaayo> i know literally nothing about sns because it seemed like the most boring weapon, should i try it out?
[2:51:24] <DasFreekman> oooo yeah
[2:51:31] <dan_g_v> @rumtumtugnutz Pat wanted him dumb sounding
[2:51:33] <Blank9> You can also perfect rush out of ZR + A
[2:51:34] <framewindowcleaner> @BoxNavy Fair enough. To me, broken is IG or CG in MH4U, not just being very good
[2:51:39] <%BoxNavy> yea sns is fun
[2:51:46] <Blank9> ZR + A also has a guard point so you can no-show roars and attacks.
[2:51:47] <%FlamingNarwhal> @Kiaayo sns is a ton of fun
[2:51:47] <+Akizea> @kiaayo all the weapons are good now tbh so play whatever you want
[2:51:48] <spawnzie> and you havent even hit the silkbinds yet
[2:51:57] <+RealPT1> SnS is super valid
[2:52:01] <jorniev> spoken like a wifi warrior
[2:52:02] <spawnzie> as a counter
[2:52:02] <follyofjolly> If you get hit when it flashes blue
[2:52:02] <%Cykron> So uh when do you fight the monsters?
[2:52:03] <+D00msDayDan> @Kiaayo it's lowkey cranked once you learn the combos, building wide-range and healing/buffing your teammates is pretty nifty too
[2:52:04] <%solracc25> boomerand
[2:52:06] <+Shishi1205> king shakalaka that was it's name
[2:52:11] <Blank9> yeah just x after it counters
[2:52:11] <butthurtdave> I just hope Lance gets the advancing shield and corkscrew blow back so I actually can feel cool playing Lance again
[2:52:13] <%BoxNavy> @framewindowcleaner ah. by that standard sns wasnt busted then just really really good lol
[2:52:14] <+AWr00tBear> In World you could side roll into back hop into perfect rush
[2:52:14] <dan_g_v> dog and cat are imitating you behind your back XD
[2:52:17] <+TheBitingIrish> What're the specials for SnS? Is one the shield uppercut?
[2:52:19] <Rotten112> good ol sns
[2:52:23] <+Akizea> dual blades are absolutely RIDICULOUS now
[2:52:25] <%WhereIsWill> WHAT
[2:52:25] <EynosStyles> no number pops out monster dead got it
[2:52:32] <blackbookalpha> I still lol at Team Darkside using infinity short-range coating by using bow as a melee weapon
[2:52:38] <%solracc25> do the pals come with on a 4 player quest?
[2:52:42] <dan_g_v> hardest quest so far
[2:52:44] <+Shishi1205> yes biting
[2:52:48] <+Akizea> @solracc25 yup
[2:52:49] <Blank9> Everything feels ridiculous, except IG is just base World version and Lance is zzz
[2:52:50] <%Valdorick> You collected shroom - EPIC MUSIC
[2:52:50] <rReizs> i was told shoryugeki was back where is my rising shield uppercut
[2:52:52] <framewindowcleaner> @BoxNavyNothing is as broken as IG and CGB in MH4U anyway LUL
[2:52:52] <wierus> is greatsword just pretty much the same?
[2:52:52] <%primarch_lupercal> jp twitter just released trailer for version 2.0
[2:52:53] <+TheBitingIrish> Fuck yea
[2:52:53] <+Akizea> 4 hunters 4 pals

[2:53:08] <Blank9> Shoryu's a skill you swap in
[2:53:10] <%Broand> Oh hey you can set your in game language to monster hunter language instead of Japanese or English
[2:53:13] <%Cykron> Same relative size and everything
[2:53:15] <dan_g_v> we need an animation where the Palamute just knocks you down on your back
[2:53:19] <+Akizea> @primarch_lupercal 2.0 for what?
[2:53:20] <butthurtdave> oh it's either? well dog all the way for the speed

[3:15:19] <supra_nightmare> why did i always think that MH was always just a paid version of Dauntless?
[3:15:20] <rReizs> didn't stop yian kut ku from murdering new players
[3:15:22] <+Maxthetics> Honestly the way these games take SO long to just build back into the REAL game is part of what makes me not wanna go in on this again
[3:15:25] <%alcors_wisdom> @Kain5707 everytime you lose consiousness that one is destroyed and a new one is made when you awake so is anyone truly the same person they were yestarday?

[3:16:36] <+impressionistcowboy> the film grain in the intros are really doing it for me
[3:16:38] <supra_nightmare> @Shishi1205 i know this is going to sound crazy but i have not seen this game until just now. someone told me once it was basically dauntless so i never wasted my time
[3:16:38] <+Grayhammatter> honey badger bear
[3:16:39] <%Nekros4442> Time to go ham and never stop
[3:16:42] <pitsuji> please respect him hes BLOODLUST INCARNATE

[3:16:52] <+datmegamandeeeee> bloodlust? arzuros??? wtf? lol
[3:16:52] <jorniev> THESE DESINGS ARE AMAZING
[3:16:53] <Discount_CJ> Why are you using duel blades?
[3:16:54] <blackbookalpha> demon mode activate
[3:16:55] <%alcors_wisdom> straight up thought pat was going to say "its been a long time since ive hunted a bear"
[3:16:58] <%stickygumbolee> That's just a digimon
[3:16:58] <%BoxNavy> i hope raw and status dual blades are viable this time around
[3:17:00] <%Treuan> There's the demon dance
[3:17:08] <+Shishi1205> that someone did you a shitty advice
[3:17:16] <DasFreekman> Goal of Dual Blades: SPEEEEEEEEN
[3:17:16] <OneThousandTomatoes> dauntless is bargain bin monster hunter
[3:17:19] <jorniev> EDGELORD
[3:17:31] <Aydarkzero> Dauntless was pretty bad
[3:17:31] <Rawbone_saw> be in demon mode to build meter
[3:17:32] <%alcors_wisdom> imagine not using a hammer
[3:17:33] <deviljhojho_> i liked that one beaver monster
[3:17:36] <Klefth> Fucking doggu drifto, man. I need it
[3:17:42] <+datmegamandeeeee> good boi just wants snacks, he ain't dangerous
[3:17:42] <%Nekros4442> Dauntless tried to make it to market before the next MH came out (MHW) and it failed
[3:17:45] <+D00msDayDan> i remember when it looked like dauntless might have been not bad
[3:17:48] <Rawbone_saw> u want beter filled all time, to use the bug move stab and then attack asap
[3:17:49] <+Akizea> dualblades are nutty
[3:17:55] <Kain5707> Daunltess is just fortnut monster hunter
[3:17:58] <ScreamLord> Some of the weapons are cool tho. Like the Gun Hammer
[3:17:58] <%BoxNavy> what if monster hunter had a battle pass
[3:17:59] <+Maxthetics> Dauntless would have had a purpose but then MH became a PC series as well and suddenly there was legit no reason Dauntless should exist lol
[3:18:01] <supra_nightmare> yea my experience with Dauntless was horrible and i was told this was similar so i stayed away from it but this looks compltely different
[3:18:02] <Evendrag> holy shit u go fast
[3:18:03] <Blank9> It got a big damage stab and an adept counter
[3:18:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> dauntless has some ok creature animations thats it
[3:18:26] <dan_g_v> that was a Peach Bomber!
[3:18:27] <%asgard147> Eat the Bear Pat limesEvil
[3:18:27] <$Dakuu75> why wouldn't they let us ride mounts like this MHW, gees.
[3:18:34] <dan_g_v> super strong butt!
[3:18:36] <Frostydough1> Dauntless Is good entry point for monster hunting games, very simplistic but you pick up the basics quick
[3:18:41] <%alcors_wisdom> is it just me or does this monster seem really small after MHW
[3:18:42] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah this ks much better than dauntless
[3:18:42] <+Maxthetics> I liked the big owl from Dauntless.
[3:18:43] <Kain5707> limesEvil
[3:18:43] <+AWr00tBear> The stab is really short range
[3:18:46] <+Goblinz_3> Numbers go smol
[3:18:47] <Evendrag> dauntless doesnt have the right feel to it
[3:18:48] <Frostydough1> I enjoyed my time with it since i couldnt afford world and iceborne
[3:18:49] <fjordicjordic> Starting dual blades look cool, I like the asymetry
[3:18:57] <%Nekros4442> Why do many small number when big number feel better ;p
[3:18:58] <Scott_Steiner2> nugiP
[3:19:04] <$Dakuu75> Look at this big-ass tutorial bear, lol
[3:19:10] <Blank9> The stab does more damage the more you hit before it explodes.
[3:19:12] <DasFreekman> lot numbers.many dmg
[3:19:24] <ioriac> how is it pat?
[3:19:31] <dan_g_v> aww let him hug you

[3:19:40] <Saltmeisterr> CatJAM
[3:19:42] <+BigbysOffice> can you disable the talking?
[3:19:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> big number is morally superior
[3:19:45] <follyofjolly> Finally we have an appropriate setting for naruto running about with the db
[3:19:47] <+RealPT1> is real zangief getting confused you keep calling his name for game gief?
[3:19:50] <Xenioplate> I tried playing Dauntless and got bored within the first part of it because it lacks the interesting things from MH
[3:19:50] <blackbookalpha> get hugs lose honey
[3:19:55] <%Treuan> H-he's fast!
[3:19:55] <BlueSpartan119> @BigbysOffice yes

[3:20:47] <%BoxNavy> adept dodge jermaVenus
[3:20:52] <+BusterRepukken> you interrupted the pooh bears honey time
[3:20:56] <OneThousandTomatoes> did he just say "weapon get dull"
[3:21:01] <blackbookalpha> Sharpening on dog is such a game changer
[3:21:04] <$Dakuu75> WTF was that ONE sharp-animation sharpen
[3:21:12] <OneThousandTomatoes> what a himbo voice
[3:21:12] <+Shishi1205> wow straight up adept
[3:21:16] <+Akizea> honestly I wonder how nutty world 2 is gonna be if rise is already this wild
[3:21:20] <inpaladin> sad the valor run didn't make it
[3:21:28] <rReizs> no double dash after?
[3:21:35] <Evendrag> now he is just a shit-talking sponge
[3:21:37] <DublinRage> @onethousandtomatoes "Weapon's gettin' dull"
[3:21:43] <+Goblinz_3> This is truly the love child of world and gen ultimate
[3:21:46] <+Shishi1205> there is no way they name it world 2
[3:21:55] <supra_nightmare> how long does it take to beat the game?
[3:21:58] <blackbookalpha> blind with OLED flies

[3:22:03] <+Goblinz_3> World ultimate Kappa
[3:22:19] <%FlamingNarwhal> @Shishi1205 monster hunter new worlds
[3:22:22] <+BusterRepukken> @Shishi1205 World: New Frontier
[3:22:28] <%alcors_wisdom> the real question is when is this game coming to PC
[3:22:30] <Zombrocom> Iceborne was world ultimate
[3:22:32] <+Akizea> we're gonna tentatively call it world 2 lol
[3:22:37] <+Shishi1205> beating MH story is kinda just the beginning
[3:22:38] <%BoxNavy> @alcors_wisdom 2022
[3:22:40] <rReizs> that bear will dab on him eventually
[3:22:42] <Zombrocom> @alcors_wisdom Early 2022
[3:22:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> @alcors_wisdom 2022
[3:22:44] <%Ynkubus_> The 6th gen MH game will just have a thematic subtitle since theyre apparently dropping numbers
[3:22:47] <%FlamingNarwhal> @alcors_wisdom 2022
[3:22:48] <+Shishi1205> it has infinite endgame
[3:22:50] <Kain5707> monster hunter a realm reborn KEKW
[3:22:50] <DasFreekman> "beating" MonHun games LUL
[3:23:00] <DublinRage> I hope the DB weapon for this guy is just Bear Arms
[3:23:06] <Xenioplate> @alcors_wisdom next year, no word yet when but they're working on it
[3:23:07] <%alcors_wisdom> oh fuck they actually gave a date? i was joking bitchen
[3:23:08] <BlueSpartan119> Monster Hunter Portable 5th
[3:23:16] <blackbookalpha> carve ass
[3:23:18] <+Shishi1205> yeah numbers are gone for mainline MHs now
[3:23:23] <+Kiaayo> you knocked him over like 3 times
[3:23:25] <%BoxNavy> you got him one time
[3:23:26] <AllJoeShow> its cus your using butter knives
[3:23:27] <%FlamingNarwhal> Gief swingin the knife around on a rope is fucking sick
[3:23:28] <supra_nightmare> @Shishi1205 oh i see! how long does the story part take roughly?
[3:23:32] <nuane> baby numbers
[3:23:33] <+Goblinz_3> Because he's a bear pat
[3:23:41] <BlueSpartan119> ride?
[3:23:44] <%BoxNavy> oh
[3:23:57] <%ClericOfSparda> mounted?
[3:23:57] <$Dakuu75> stagger?
[3:23:57] <%alcors_wisdom> the opposite of enraged
[3:23:58] <redapache> Pat attack the ass stick it in his ass for more damage
[3:24:00] <Slim_Lipid> mounted😈
[3:24:00] <Zombrocom> "Wirebound" I guess?
[3:24:02] <+Shishi1205> Rough estimate less than 20 hours
[3:24:05] <Blank9> you really have to spam the kunai stab if you want that
[3:24:06] <OneThousandTomatoes> @bluespartan119 you'll see
[3:24:09] <$Dakuu75> exhaust?
[3:24:14] <%BoxNavy> hit more blue number
[3:24:18] <AllJoeShow> theres a spider at the 5 that just puts them in that state...
[3:24:18] <+zanzibar_junker> Butt slam
[3:24:23] <+Kiaayo> you're not doing enough blue damage
[3:24:28] <BlueSpartan119> @OneThousandTomatoes oh I know, I was guessing at the word
[3:24:30] <supra_nightmare> oh 20 hrs is not bad
[3:24:34] <%extradopeness> great job hunting the monstars, going to buy this after I beat final cut because I promised myself that I wouldn’t buy any other games until it dropped! Anyway, here’s hoping for more Rise streams in the future! (and maybe less fortnite lol)
[3:24:35] <+Shishi1205> 15 or so? depends on your tendency to play around
[3:24:37] <+Goblinz_3> Need more air damage
[3:24:39] <follyofjolly> I thought it was the blue damage that lead to mounts
[3:24:41] <Blank9> each hit you do while the kunai's stabbed in does more mount damage until it's exploded
[3:24:42] <OneThousandTomatoes> unless you meant...yeah
[3:24:50] <%Ynkubus_> Story will probs take 15-30 hours depending how good you are
[3:24:55] <+Shishi1205> if you beeline it 8 hours
[3:24:58] <kr3b5> I'm so sad PC has to wait another year for this. :(
[3:25:10] <+datmegamandeeeee> you got the arms, they should be a soft spot, along with his butt
[3:25:10] <$Dakuu75> duel blades are a fucking stamina-sink. holyl crap
[3:25:26] <Blank9> wait until you see bow
[3:25:29] <butthurtdave> I recommend going HH for your next fight
[3:25:33] <%BoxNavy> really hope the next monster hunter doesnt get stuck with an exclusivity deal
[3:25:33] <%alcors_wisdom> @Ynkubus_ more like depending on how much fashion hunter you want to play
[3:25:41] <%FacetiousAF> the baby
[3:25:42] <%BoxNavy> amazing!
[3:25:42] <+BusterRepukken> amaz-ing
[3:25:43] <butthurtdave> EMLO
[3:25:45] <SiegmundCG> so much 1 dmg it's like you're playing paper mario
[3:25:45] <rReizs> go in order, its hammer time next
[3:25:55] <Blank9> launching a monster into another monster lets you instantly mount the other monster
[3:25:57] <Rotten112> @BoxNavy isn't this coming to pc later?
[3:26:02] <%BoxNavy> ELMO
[3:26:05] <+Left_Justified> Awesome!
[3:26:07] <+Kiaayo> in like a year
[3:26:09] <kr3b5> in like a year
[3:26:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> 2022 pc
[3:26:13] <%BoxNavy> @Rotten112 yeah. i meant timed exclusivity oops
[3:26:16] <%Ynkubus_> @alcors_wisdom oh no, you fool, thats on an entirely seperate time scale
[3:26:20] <+Maxthetics> What are these crowd sounds
[3:26:23] <+Neku054> i dont think ive payed attention but when you slam them on walls are they taking damage?
[3:26:25] <+bravodavo> 2!
[3:26:33] <%alcors_wisdom> @Ynkubus_ fair
[3:26:35] <+bravodavo> alkGuku
[3:26:36] <+Kiaayo> 2022 isn't real, monster hunter rise pc and splatoon 3 aren't real
[3:26:37] <$Dakuu75> look at his big "come at me bro" taunt, lol
[3:26:42] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:26:44] <%Nekros4442> Just Strider this shit

[3:27:28] <OneThousandTomatoes> @maxthetics what do you mean?
[3:27:37] <+Left_Justified> @Nekros4442 Kuma atpHarada
[3:27:38] <Vendigear> lookit those dinky numbers
[3:27:40] <follyofjolly> Is it me or is Azruos's move set a little more aggresive when mad now?
[3:27:41] <Zombrocom> Aww poor bear is injured
[3:27:56] <$Dakuu75> @FlamingNarwhal really? You don't think "naruto-running"? lol
[3:27:57] <%Monkeyweed21> Remember when Whetstones were consumable and you had to look for more mid hunt @PatStaresAt
[3:27:57] <+Goblinz_3> Because you're a baby right now
[3:27:59] <butthurtdave> getting a critical hit for 1 damage is funny
[3:28:00] <+Goblinz_3> Baby hunter
[3:28:02] <follyofjolly> Nice
[3:28:11] <%extradopeness> Ninja Gaiden
[3:28:17] <BlueSpartan119> accounting for the increased fluidity

[3:28:27] <akitanito> that ass is ruiined by the thousand cuts
[3:28:30] <%asgard147> Carve the bear!
[3:28:34] <Saltmeisterr> He ded
[3:28:39] <%FlamingNarwhal> @Dakuu75 i straight up think "what does the fortnite guy have to do with this" like 80% of the time
[3:28:41] <$Dakuu75> SMOKIN SEXY STYLE

[3:30:10] <DasFreekman> NUMBER BIG
[3:30:13] <%FacetiousAF> MORE
[3:30:15] <+Gespens> I'm a vanilla lance person, so you know I love my water room temperature, my bread white and consider pepper spicy
[3:30:20] <Giztech> how about that hunters horn?
[3:30:23] <%FlamingNarwhal> pat check armors pleeease
[3:30:25] <%drabberfaun535> @Vijuani YO
[3:30:28] <+Maxthetics> Charge Blade and Switch Axe are the sickest because they're basically bloodbourne trick weapons
[3:30:29] <butthurtdave> I just want Lance to have some fancy big damage moves again.  The arts from 4 made me so happy but then they were stripped away
[3:30:29] <Blank9> I use a different handful of weapons each game
[3:30:31] <blackbookalpha> I discovered melee ARROW since it doesn't use up coatings
[3:30:32] <kr3b5> @Vijuani just kite the monster to a ledge and spam ledge move 5Head
[3:30:33] <%extradopeness> Big pink flower

[3:30:38] <%FlamingNarwhal> many thanks!
[3:30:41] <%Nekros4442> I imagine Lance will be alot more fun in this version. YOu just have so much more base mobility
[3:30:42] <OneThousandTomatoes> armoire
[3:30:46] <follyofjolly> Gunlance is apparently much better in Rise with some of the new guard points and moves you can put in
[3:30:48] <+datmegamandeeeee> you got parts for the thing you wanna make, not that you can finish it
[3:30:50] <+Vijuani> @Monkeyweed21 lmao

[3:35:41] <+Grayhammatter> baggi time
[3:35:42] <%BoxNavy> great izuchis armor seems ok for low rank
[3:35:45] <follyofjolly> @Monkeyweed21 Don't worry they made up for it with some nice buffs
[3:35:45] <%extradopeness> You just do a big swing and then a big shoot and a big reload and a big repeat
[3:35:47] <%Monkeyweed21> the loss of Wrymstake mine is a big nerf from Iceborne
[3:35:55] <DasFreekman> Gunlance is my romance language
[3:35:56] <therealtacopancakes> fuck the last MH I played was on the psp, I now want a switch :(
[3:36:00] <+datmegamandeeeee> oh, she's cute

[3:36:12] <%FacetiousAF> @Blank9 on fuckin god????
[3:36:13] <+cowkid222> that mochi stretching makes me very uncomfortable
[3:36:15] <Blank9> You can also do a fast wyvernstake by pressing back + A after any charged shell.
[3:36:15] <OneThousandTomatoes> pat go look at the gathering hub canteen scene
[3:36:17] <Sotetsu> Is this still the tutorial?

[3:37:30] <+BigChiefBear> chat
[3:37:33] <jorniev> DONT BLINK
[3:37:33] <boardscanada> the game seems to have much more style to it than World
[3:37:34] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Pat  got early copy
[3:37:34] <%baka_sugoi> Nature is WILD
[3:37:36] <%extradopeness> This is hard
[3:37:36] <LordOfThePoultry> F
[3:37:40] <+Pachi3000> snow!
[3:37:42] <%Monkeyweed21> sleepy boi
[3:37:44] <%FlamingNarwhal> @BigChiefBear pat has a code from capcom
[3:37:45] <+BigChiefBear> fuk
[3:37:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> so stupid i love it
[3:37:46] <BlueSpartan119> CUNNING USURPER
[3:37:49] <+ALazo> he is so angry
[3:37:50] <%newtype89> okay baggi never sounded more nafareus
[3:37:50] <+yoshkosh20> your dude sounds like white barret.
[3:37:51] <+datmegamandeeeee> this guy is a legitimate bully
[3:37:52] <%BoxNavy> after that wirebug move you can do a full burst
[3:37:53] <+Grayhammatter> this goes hard
[3:37:53] <+jpizzle777> wow this hits diff
[3:37:56] <butthurtdave> WHY DOES CAPCOM HATE THE REGULAR LANCE SO MUCH
[3:37:57] <kr3b5> oh its a gunlance
[3:37:59] <%BestTeaMaker> YOUR STARTING GUNLANCE IS A SCYTHE
[3:38:03] <theincrediblerick> great grappler baggi
[3:38:03] <NeroInfinite> Why's it scythe? LUL
[3:38:03] <%neroforte177> aight now take off like a rocket
[3:38:07] <$KnivesEve> it may be a great baggi. but its not the greatest jaggi
[3:38:09] <follyofjolly> You can do so sick aerial shelling with that but I don't know how
[3:38:12] <%Broand> God I haven't gunlanced in years
[3:38:12] <+Grayhammatter> wtf, A SCYTHE!
[3:38:14] <tattleworm> you can do full bursts in the air now
[3:38:16] <+datmegamandeeeee> you chose a bad monster to pick up gunlance.
[3:38:17] <Oxybe> 20 minutes and it's midnight in Atlantic Canada... C'MON AND HURRY I WANT TO PLAY THE GAME
[3:38:18] <%Broand> I picked it for this game tho
[3:38:19] <Tooniearcade> gunlance looks cool
[3:38:19] <Vendigear> @PatStaresAt Try shelling in the air and GO TO SPACE
[3:38:26] <%FacetiousAF> one wirebug is a shield that regens sharpness??
[3:38:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> lance players want lance to be simple yet deep
[3:38:28] <Blank9> X+A then mash X to do the slam into full burst
[3:38:28] <blackbookalpha> Lance's got mobility now in Rise. Silkbind just lets you JUMP into the monster
[3:38:28] <+aaropoll> if I never played World should I get this or play world
[3:38:34] <+datmegamandeeeee> watch out for the bois
[3:38:36] <+yoshkosh20> can you couch your lance while riding the dog?
[3:38:38] <Aydarkzero> wasn't expecting a snow area
[3:38:39] <risenlp2> Felyne needs it's own dog
[3:38:41] <butthurtdave> Hot Drinks are no longer required
[3:38:43] <BlueSpartan119> hot and cool drinks dont exist anymore
[3:38:45] <Kain5707> get rise
[3:38:45] <butthurtdave> Cold is no longer a afactor
[3:38:46] <+bobfriskit> I dont think you need it
[3:38:47] <%newtype89> hot and cold drinks are no more
[3:38:50] <%FacetiousAF> @aaropoll if you already have a switch then world. if you have a good pc then world and wait for this.
[3:38:55] <%FlamingNarwhal> drinks are gone
[3:38:58] <Aydarkzero> good
[3:39:00] <%Monkeyweed21> DRINKS ARE GONE
[3:39:00] <Vendigear> I cant decide if I like that
[3:39:01] <+AWr00tBear> Charge shot then hold back and A for Quick Wyrmstake
[3:39:02] <UnfilteredComic> Excuse me
[3:39:02] <%BoxNavy> yeah dude
[3:39:02] <blackbookalpha> no more drinks just hunt
[3:39:03] <+D00msDayDan> THANK GOD
[3:39:03] <LordOfThePoultry> they gone
[3:39:05] <+GrandmasterBFunk> yeah they had said that before, hot and cold drinks are gon
[3:39:06] <TheRealNumberJ42> thank god
[3:39:08] <DovaDude29> no hot coco?
[3:39:08] <+Grayhammatter> oh, that's interesting
[3:39:08] <$yeknomlive> how can this be
[3:39:12] <Zombrocom> Hot Drinks are dead
[3:39:13] <DublinRage> but then how do we deal with Lunastra?
[3:39:14] <OneThousandTomatoes> @aaropoll inthink they meant if you have a switch then this
[3:39:14] <+Goblinz_3> Turns out your clothes keep you warm Kappa
[3:39:16] <Aydarkzero> 🦀 drinks are gone 🦀
[3:39:17] <huskarl_zap> todd strikes again
[3:39:23] <butthurtdave> They realized everybody always forgot them on quests and decided to drop them.  That's literally the exact phrasing
[3:39:23] <kamenspidey> lukewarm drinks only
[3:39:24] <Oxybe> Kamura Ninjas come with long underwear. they warm and snuggly
[3:39:33] <%Monkeyweed21> yea it didnt add anything to the game i;m happy its gone
[3:39:35] <%neroforte177> thank god thyat was a needless mechanic
[3:39:35] <DovaDude29> bruh you need the hot and cold when your in a desert or ice map though?
[3:39:39] <blackbookalpha> Director Ichinose took it out since people kept forgetting it before hunts
[3:39:42] <kr3b5> damn the hunter talks a lot
[3:39:43] <Blank9> A after the slam to shoot all shells at once
[3:39:46] <DSD24> Because its a gunscythe
[3:39:51] <+TheBitingIrish> All the starter weapons look pretty rad
[3:39:52] <DovaDude29> no its realistic to need water in the desert tho
[3:39:54] <DovaDude29> makes sense
[3:39:56] <wdga> the starting gear is always sick and then you immediately replace it with trash
[3:39:59] <DSD24> @kr3b5 You can set the dialogue to off if you want
[3:40:03] <%FlamingNarwhal> @kr3b5 you can turn down the frequency or mute it all together
[3:40:03] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> its a stupid resource so im fine with it
[3:40:09] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you can upgrade the Kamura weapons through the whole game
[3:40:11] <DSD24> and also adjust the frequency of Hunter barks
[3:40:13] <Grzy514> no drinks is a nice QoL change
[3:40:15] <kr3b5> oh neat
[3:40:18] <Ashecroft> @PatStaresAt At full charge the starting hammer is basically an anchor, starting weapons shouldnt be this cool but Im glad they are
[3:40:19] <kr3b5> thats very cool
[3:40:22] <+TheBitingIrish> Khezu hole monkaS
[3:40:24] <%Monkeyweed21> like the Defender gear they added to World
[3:40:27] <Aydarkzero> [Low]
[3:40:31] <+Goblinz_3> Kill it Kappa
[3:40:34] <blackbookalpha> Hope Pat finds the giant skeleton
[3:40:37] <ergulor> hug it
[3:40:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> big chungus
[3:40:40] <DSD24> Khezu is cool
[3:40:41] <rasamune> bunny!
[3:40:42] <+TheNommad> Hi Pat
[3:40:44] <+yourfriendtusks> cant wait to bop to khezu's theme
[3:40:44] <+Grayhammatter> khezu monkaS
[3:40:45] <DSD24> He got the long neck
[3:40:46] <AllenDeadman> wait... we don't need hot drinks?
[3:40:57] <butthurtdave> Also one thing I disliked about World is how I always got lost in certain spots on certain maps.  Fukkin Vale and Ancient Forest kept tripping me up in G Rank
[3:40:57] <+datmegamandeeeee> idk how i feel about the hunter talking so much :/
[3:41:04] <%FacetiousAF> hmm. bet barioth is around somewhere.
[3:41:04] <redapache> @patstaresat You miss Gigginox? Kappa
[3:41:06] <%TheWinged7> wait you can carve on the  dog?
[3:41:06] <Aydarkzero> all these monsters feels like World barely scratched the surface
[3:41:18] <DSD24> @datmegamandeeeee You can set the dialogue to off if you want
[3:41:20] <stormhawk9891> I just realized there might be people here who don't know Khezu
[3:41:22] <Ner234> @datmegamandeeeee You can turn it off
[3:41:32] <blackbookalpha> lol Skull
[3:41:33] <Aydarkzero> @stormhawk9891 dat me
[3:41:40] <Slim_Lipid> i wonder why LUL
[3:41:41] <%BoxNavy> they cut down heavily on the verticality this game i like it
[3:41:47] <WeebFever> That's probably because 2 of the 5 are actually maps from Tri and the rest are styled after it.
[3:41:47] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Isn't this based on the 3 ice map?
[3:41:48] <OneThousandTomatoes> ,orah skull
[3:41:54] <OneThousandTomatoes> zorah*
[3:41:55] <butthurtdave> Remember how the only Water monster in World before Iceborne was Jyuratodas?
[3:42:09] <DSD24> I like how dark it is
[3:42:10] <blackbookalpha> zorah skull has a shrine built on top of it
[3:42:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> @grandmasterbfunk no
[3:42:15] <+cade_calrayn> Pat.... your character is such a dudebro, I just can't
[3:42:19] <%Monkeyweed21> @Aydarkzero every odd generation starts with a game that focuses on new additions at the expense of returning monsters, i.e. Tri and World
[3:42:23] <%squidking96> @butthurtdave and jagras
[3:42:30] <dan_g_v> a crystal lizard!
[3:42:33] <%TheWinged7> its a crystal lizard
[3:42:36] <Aydarkzero> @Monkeyweed21 makes sense
[3:42:40] <BlueSpartan119> from what I've seen Jyura got a glow up in rise
[3:42:42] <ergulor> stinky
[3:42:54] <+GrandmasterBFunk> @OneThousandTomatoes ahh, i couldn't remember which ones were based on 3 maps
[3:43:04] <Blank9> X+A -> X -> A for big boom
[3:43:05] <+rDAKODAc> Hey Pat what weapon do you recommend for a beginner?
[3:43:08] <butthurtdave> Hey Pat, get airborne and hit the shell button
[3:43:13] <OneThousandTomatoes> flooded forest is a 3u map
[3:43:14] <%squidking96> i hope konchu are back
[3:43:25] <%BoxNavy> baggy...
[3:43:29] <Aydarkzero> i really hope Nergigante is in this

[3:44:05] <Grzy514> the jukes
[3:44:06] <+dekker21> dekker21 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! Hay pat, Thank you and Woolie for all the podcasts, they kept me sain as i was cutting down my fence to burn for warmth when that ice storm fucked Texas!
[3:44:06] <OneThousandTomatoes> oof

[3:44:08] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:44:10] <Oxybe> i love the woodwinds
[3:44:11] <%BoxNavy> you block during wyverns fire now btw
[3:44:16] <nuane> LU
[3:44:19] <nuane> LUL
[3:44:20] <Blank9> guard + X +A is wyvernfire too
[3:44:27] <+kubozuka27> OH DAMN, the starter gun lance is a freaking Halberd/scythe? Fuck I love this game.
[3:44:33] <DSD24> @dekker21 Man that storm was the god damn worst
[3:44:34] <Aydarkzero> sleep status monkaS
[3:44:50] <WeebFever> Losing to baggiwheel
[3:44:59] <DublinRage> my god, I just noticed they made it easier to see if your Wyvern's Fire was on cooldown!
[3:45:06] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[3:45:07] <+AWr00tBear> Guard edge into Wyrmstake with A
[3:45:07] <dan_g_v> @dekker21 eesh, sounds rough. Hope you're doing better
[3:45:19] <%FlamingNarwhal> @WeebFever is this the streamer that beat darksouls 2 on stream?
[3:45:19] <Vendigear> waitaminue, those are Anjanath moves
[3:45:24] <DSD24> I think you need to do a input Pat
[3:45:27] <+TheBitingIrish> Pat, RELOAD
[3:45:31] <+yourfriendtusks> one of your silkbinds reduces your wyvernfire cooldown
[3:45:32] <$Stari> That move restores sharpness when you get hit
[3:45:34] <+The__Strongest> you need to reload the stake pat
[3:45:35] <%Nekros4442> Same skeleton
[3:45:35] <BlueSpartan119> you can slam after the counter, also it refills sharpness
[3:45:37] <UnfilteredComic> Reload ya stake
[3:45:41] <+cade_calrayn> gief sniff
[3:45:41] <blackbookalpha> mon needs to hit
[3:45:45] <+bobfriskit> @PatStaresAt the counter sharpens
[3:45:49] <+cade_calrayn> look at that blep
[3:45:56] <LordOfThePoultry> reload for stake
[3:46:10] <+yourfriendtusks> sleepy boy
[3:46:16] <Aydarkzero> haha
[3:46:21] <DSD24> Elmo with the assist
[3:46:21] <Vendigear> Elmo coming in clutch
[3:46:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> you can set the health and stamina bars so they minimalize when youre not in combat or using stamina
[3:46:24] <+Grayhammatter> sleep more?
[3:46:26] <akitanito> elmo cut your ankles
[3:46:29] <+bobfriskit> The other wirebug shortens the cooldown
[3:46:33] <+cade_calrayn> He looks like such a doofus in that shirt, lol
[3:46:34] <butthurtdave> Wyrmstake is still in this right?
[3:46:34] <SpawnConnery> "Yeah the answer is more sleep" - Zangeif
[3:46:40] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[3:46:48] <TheRealNumberJ42> :(

[3:47:13] <%walternatorz> zangief is jealous of newzangief
[3:47:19] <+thechungiestofbois> Why did you give yourself the creepo voice pat
[3:47:21] <follyofjolly> he sounds like a dude bro yoda a bit when he says that
[3:47:35] <Devbob98> WhAt’S ThIS?
[3:47:42] <+rbakervv> @thechungiestofbois he thinks it's funny
[3:47:45] <butthurtdave> You['ve got wyvern fire ready again
[3:47:47] <%neroforte177> hey @chat anybody know any good monhun discords??
[3:47:59] <DSD24> Bringing the heat!
[3:48:01] <OneThousandTomatoes> @thechungiestofbois cause it sounds like macho man randy savage
[3:48:04] <+Freakgurru> Break his butt
[3:48:05] <%TigerCatGo> I remember this Monster from the Stories RPG! My only exposure to MH lol
[3:48:07] <TallPixels> those blood effects looks straight out of deadly premonition 2
[3:48:09] <akitanito> range seems super short
[3:48:14] <DSD24> Man I love Pat's hunter! he's so energetic!
[3:48:21] <Ner234> Fucking Remobra
[3:48:25] <+Left_Justified> atpBird
[3:48:43] <Devbob98> God I love the steam effect
[3:48:49] <+kubozuka27> You’re gonna “remobra” this attack you piece of trash monster!
[3:49:04] <%twoto858> I guess no need for a hot drink or something?
[3:49:07] <%ThirdWelles> Just tuned in. This music is fucking rad
[3:49:21] <Zombrocom> Yeah hot drinks and cool drinks are gone
[3:49:27] <%BoxNavy> you can full burst after that move
[3:49:31] <+datmegamandeeeee> boy, they nerfed baggi. when he used to be in danger he'd move at around twice the speed
[3:49:39] <%neroforte177> @twoto858 no need to drink at al in this game
[3:49:42] <%TallPixels> epic
[3:49:43] <follyofjolly> You can do a follow up slam after the counter, but yeah its not as impressive as the other which lets you sky shell
[3:49:48] <Slim_Lipid> oh shit zangief with the B E A N B U F F
[3:50:00] <Blank9> charge shells -> back A for wyvernstake is great damage
[3:50:05] <Aydarkzero> big mad
[3:50:10] <Manwad> can't you stake right after the overhead burst?
[3:50:13] <EynosStyles> press a after the steam
[3:50:15] <+yourfriendtusks> nice
[3:50:15] <%GinAndRoses> BOOM
[3:50:17] <Aydarkzero> nice finish

[3:50:30] <+BoltWarden> nooice
[3:50:32] <Oxybe> DRAMATIC FINISH!
[3:50:32] <butthurtdave> Wait you guard during Wyvern Fire now?
[3:50:35] <+AngriestAngryArtist> They should have a slow mo cinematic camera when you do that last hit for kill
[3:50:35] <DSD24> Daddy needs a new pair of boots!
[3:50:36] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> BODIED
[3:50:37] <+datmegamandeeeee> that did 60, make sure to use it as it's up

[3:50:57] <%ThirdWelles> Monster hunter man just acknowledged the existence of viscera
[3:51:00] <DSD24> The planet's dying brrrrt
[3:51:10] <+bobfriskit> i think that move lowers wyrfire cooldown
[3:51:11] <Blank9> the aerial slam move also makes wyvernfire recharge faster
[3:51:11] <+yourfriendtusks> monster hunter is good!!!!
[3:51:15] <$StrawberryPantsu> Lance>>GunLance
[3:51:15] <+SimplyRandy> pat, thoughts so far?
[3:51:16] <Kain5707> 1 hour and 10 minutes PogChamp
[3:51:19] <+TenKaiHunter> Hi Baggi, bye Baggi
[3:51:21] <ExemplarKyle> The starting gunlance has a goddamn scythe on it? WHY IS THAT SO COOL
[3:51:22] <%ThirdWelles> Which means monsters are freaks for not bleeding
[3:51:24] <OneThousandTomatoes> bloods back in this game
[3:51:25] <TheRealNumberJ42> the ancient forest is so bad
[3:51:27] <+thechungiestofbois> I HATE THE ANCIENT FOREST
[3:51:27] <$StrawberryPantsu> They're taller
[3:51:29] <%newtype89> smaller but filled with more shit
[3:51:29] <%BoxNavy> ancient forest was designed by methheads
[3:51:29] <Oxybe> Agreed. AF is trash to traverse
[3:51:30] <+rDAKODAc> What is a good starter weapon?
[3:51:33] <DSD24> Look at that image
[3:51:35] <Blank9> welcome to the tree maze
[3:51:36] <Frostydough1> @PatStaresAt So is it better to wait for this one to come to other consoles or just buy it on switch if you have one?
[3:51:38] <dizimous> Oh I kind of like it
[3:51:39] <%czeekytv> idk I thought the Ancient Forest was okay. Too many skinny tunnels tho
[3:51:40] <%alcors_wisdom> spend half an hour alone running up and down the damn tree
[3:51:41] <@SoFarFetched> I get lost in there so hard even with the map
[3:51:42] <+Gespens> I thought all the vanilla world maps were horseshit tbh
[3:51:42] <%JoshManVGH> it's a series of tubes
[3:51:42] <DSD24> @rDAKODAc Hammer
[3:51:43] <%stickygumbolee> Not crazy about this series, but goddamn, do they have some incredible art books
[3:52:02] <kr3b5> stop doing hype shit this game is a year off for me :'(
[3:52:02] <%alcors_wisdom> still waiting for that switch pro tho
[3:52:06] <BlueSpartan119> I had to compartmentalize Ancient Forest as like 3 connected maps to make sense of it
[3:52:07] <%ThirdWelles> I have like 200 hours in world and I still get fucking lost in ancient forest
[3:52:08] <%Broand> It's stable so far on switch on handheld mode
[3:52:09] <Blank9> a good starter weapon would be hammer for simple/strong, sword and shield if you want fast
[3:52:12] <+CrazyVonBlazey> sup pat long time youtube watcher good to see you doing gods work here lol
[3:52:13] <Kain5707> did the new Nintendo server go up today?
[3:52:14] <BlueSpartan119> that shit is awful
[3:52:19] <Devbob98> It’s pretty wild how good it looks
[3:52:20] <+datmegamandeeeee> it's a console capcom game, most of the time they make an effor for performance
[3:52:23] <tmo200> i am very tempted to cave in and buy the game since I have at least one friend who is gonna get it
[3:52:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> pat are you gonna do multiplayer when the games out to everyone?
[3:52:30] <%Monkeyweed21> the game will be getting SIGNIFICANT post launch support for anyone who wants to wait
[3:52:36] <blackbookalpha> They should be using the new servers for Rise
[3:52:40] <Manwad> does heavy bowgun still have the wyvernfire stuff?
[3:52:43] <%ThirdWelles> This is kind of Nier-esque music
[3:52:44] <+bobfriskit> Are we still able to save item "sets"?
[3:52:45] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA HAMMER
[3:52:46] <butthurtdave> I'd say just buy the game physically and sell it when the PC release drops
[3:52:46] <%ThirdWelles> just a little
[3:52:46] <Blank9> Yeah, the only change since the demo is LS getting a slight slap on the wrist in motion values. Like, 3% it's nothing.
[3:52:49] <blackbookalpha> and not the busted Microsoft 2000 one
[3:52:50] <BlueSpartan119> yup
[3:52:52] <+BoltWarden> lookin a bit like a friggin gundam x3
[3:52:53] <rasamune> What's the character limit on names, btw?

[3:59:59] <%Nekros4442> THAT WICKED
[3:59:59] <+GrandmasterBFunk> I feel like it was only popular when there were less skimpy armour for female hunters, 4 our of 5 armours have a thigh window so it does not matter
[4:00:03] <+yourfriendtusks> OOOOH
[4:00:05] <TheRealNumberJ42> yo that hammer though
[4:00:07] <DSD24> That's sick as fuck!

[4:00:11] <Devbob98> It killed a camera, now you have to murder it
[4:00:13] <+N1netbattler> that looks pretty cool for a low rank hammer
[4:00:13] <%BestTeaMaker> IT'S A PICKAXE
[4:00:14] <blackbookalpha> Hammer so good
[4:00:18] <%captain_thickthighs> are those supposed to be haikkus?
[4:00:20] <+D00msDayDan> if starter weapons look this cool and are animated what the hell are the endgame weapons going to be like
[4:00:21] <%JoshManVGH> @thirdwelles I fucking hope so! This is great!
[4:00:22] <+Pachi3000> FLEEP
[4:00:22] <%ThirdWelles> This game kicks ass
[4:00:23] <UnfilteredComic> A fucking plus
[4:00:24] <%patriotrenegade> You beat the game yet
[4:00:24] <rasamune> I appreciate that they stick to the Japanese-style meter
[4:00:26] <+datmegamandeeeee> world hammer. interesting
[4:00:26] <%ThirdWelles> I'm so excited for PC release
[4:00:26] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> SICK
[4:00:30] <+GrandmasterBFunk> THAT IS SICk
[4:00:30] <OneThousandTomatoes> there tail cuts aren't there
[4:00:32] <+TheBitingIrish> It's a giant grappling hook
[4:00:34] <butthurtdave> it's a mace that turns into an anchor?
[4:00:34] <blackbookalpha> Sonic Spindash all over
[4:00:37] <dan_g_v> now that's a Monster Hunter weapon
[4:00:39] <+ATorL> all these starter weapons look great
[4:00:44] <%BoxNavy> slopes moon2W
[4:00:45] <%ThirdWelles> Stop moving, pat
[4:00:45] <Devbob98> That’s my favorite type of weapon style
[4:00:47] <%alcors_wisdom> for a big bang do a full charge and stand still
[4:00:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> its a anchor....wow
[4:00:57] <%FlamingNarwhal> wtf is the hammer gauge/icon for
[4:00:58] <+Goblinz_3> It's a style change now Kappa
[4:00:59] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @rasamune Nerd! But thanks for pointing that out, I appreciate that now.
[4:00:59] <%ThirdWelles> You're welcome
[4:01:00] <+yourfriendtusks> damn i might have to play hammer.....
[4:01:03] <+TheBitingIrish> They gave it GS tackle?
[4:01:06] <Oath_Othelio> It feels like a last second dodge
[4:01:08] <%BestTeaMaker> STORE YOUR HAMMER CHARGE
[4:01:09] <+Grayhammatter> i have no idea, that's whack
[4:01:09] <blackbookalpha> moveset change
[4:01:09] <UnfilteredComic> Yellow Stance/ Blue Stance
[4:01:10] <Kain5707> full charge
[4:01:10] <%patriotrenegade> I USED TO BE A WIMP BEFORE ANCHOR HAMMER
[4:01:10] <DSD24> Public Domain Wind Noises
[4:01:14] <Slim_Lipid> style down is inst-charge
[4:01:14] <%captain_thickthighs> time to smash
[4:01:14] <+AWr00tBear> All Kamura weapons are gonna be endgame weapons
[4:01:15] <+BoltWarden> I shitted
[4:01:16] <Kain5707> from purple to yellpw
[4:01:24] <OneThousandTomatoes> style switch
[4:01:29] <%patriotrenegade> NOW IM A JERK AND EVERYBODY LOVES ME
[4:01:33] <+TheBitingIrish> Time
[4:01:33] <dimensaur> you get a full charge when you switch
[4:01:35] <TheRealNumberJ42> instant charge
[4:01:42] <%BoxNavy> switch to the first one for an instant level 3 charge
[4:01:43] <Kain5707> range
[4:01:44] <%FlamingNarwhal> gotchaaa
[4:01:46] <Blank9> yellow is weaker but kinda faster
[4:01:49] <DSD24> Sometimes you just need to get a quick hit in
[4:01:51] <NenaFan101> Reggie Miller moved into March Madness, but he's not doing any of the TNT broadcasts
[4:01:51] <%Monkeyweed21> faster
[4:01:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> because you can skip chages by switching styles
[4:01:56] <UnfilteredComic> Switching to yellow is a dodge and a refresh
[4:01:56] <follyofjolly> Speed?
[4:01:57] <%alcors_wisdom> costs time to set up you may not have
[4:02:01] <Slim_Lipid> style-down to insta-charge into wirebug
[4:02:02] <Manwad> You get knocked out of blue on hit
[4:02:05] <blackbookalpha> quick hits as monster recovers
[4:02:05] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[4:02:06] <+jofrankii> if you switch from purple to yellow, you automatically get full charge for big damage
[4:02:22] <Blank9> personally I kept blue and used the ZL+A super slammer while charged
[4:02:22] <%Monkeyweed21> Hammer is king of hit and run you need the faster weaker versions sometimes
[4:02:24] <Holycow8498> Hello
[4:02:25] <Blank9> that does so much damage
[4:02:35] <Holycow8498> How far have you gotten Pat?
[4:02:37] <TheRealNumberJ42> it's the same as world they just added an icon
[4:02:47] <%BoxNavy> switching down to get the instant level 3 charge lets you charge your wirebug moves faster
[4:02:52] <+AWr00tBear> Switch mode give you instant charge for Impact crater
[4:02:52] <+SimplyRandy> hot drink!
[4:02:52] <+BlakeLocked> Does this unlock at midnight EST, or midnight PST?
[4:03:05] <Holycow8498> Midnight EST i think
[4:03:06] <Oath_Othelio> 8pm JST afaik
[4:03:08] <%FlamingNarwhal> est @BlakeLocked
[4:03:11] <%ThirdWelles> The global buffs are like the best-feeling design
[4:03:11] <Holycow8498> So an hour
[4:03:11] <+Kiaayo> it unlocks in one hour
[4:03:23] <UnfilteredComic> Can Charge thatsecond one
[4:03:24] <%FlamingNarwhal> us eshop is based on est
[4:03:27] <Oath_Othelio> Then I seem to be wrong lmao
[4:03:29] <Manwad> oh shit you can fucking force the spindash
[4:03:30] <+BlakeLocked> Oh God. Guess I'm not sleeping tonight then.
[4:03:32] <%BoxNavy> switching from blue to yellow gives you an instant level 3 charge
[4:03:34] <Blank9> Your charge carries over to the wirebug attacks.
[4:03:39] <%BoxNavy> so it charges your wirebug moves
[4:03:50] <OneThousandTomatoes> you can make it so the health and stamina bars disappear if you aren't in combat
[4:03:50] <%alcors_wisdom> you can hit Y durring a spin to do a finishing attack
[4:03:54] <+Grayhammatter> nice hit
[4:03:56] <huskarl_zap> Somehow weapons shrink
[4:03:59] <Slim_Lipid> note how you go from blue to yellow, and not blue to RED
[4:04:01] <Aydarkzero> wonder how soon you can hunt a Rathalos
[4:04:02] <%baka_sugoi> BUNNY
[4:04:03] <Oath_Othelio> Do we know how many environments there are in the game?
[4:04:06] <+Left_Justified> BOP
[4:04:09] <+jofrankii> so do that switch when using your second silk bind attack for big fast damage
[4:04:09] <Oxybe> just confirmed i can't play yet, but it's 12am atlantic time
[4:04:14] <+yourfriendtusks> bonk bonk bonk
[4:04:28] <%BoxNavy> so 1 hour est
[4:04:28] <OneThousandTomatoes> at least 5 areas
[4:04:32] <DublinRage> Lagombi sounds kinda like Banbaro.
[4:04:37] <+Grayhammatter> he bonked you
[4:04:38] <ergulor> Go lagombi kill the pat
[4:04:42] <%BoxNavy> iceblight monkaS
[4:04:42] <jotabranded> thats cool, idk Lagombi was in this game
[4:04:46] <%alcors_wisdom> while running hit Y to do a quick draw attack
[4:04:48] <%FacetiousAF> fuck now i want brachy back
[4:04:48] <+D00msDayDan> wirebug status effects
[4:04:48] <follyofjolly> Oh fuck thats not good
[4:04:51] <Aydarkzero> it's slow down on cooldown?
[4:04:52] <DublinRage> ... or vice-versa
[4:04:56] <+AWr00tBear> You definitely want to engage fights in Blue then switch to yellow for max power impact crater.
[4:04:58] <AllenDeadman> oh shit
[4:05:01] <%BoxNavy> oh yeah the spin move leads into the big bang combo now
[4:05:06] <mostundesired> Oh hey Baggi
[4:05:07] <Blank9> chameleos better eat your wirebugs
[4:05:15] <%ThirdWelles> Oh so you can dodge the ice buff off now like you can with fire
[4:05:17] <+yourfriendtusks> hi baggi
[4:05:17] <akitanito> Fight fight fight!
[4:05:28] <$JojoPiero> That's Baggi not Wroggi
[4:05:33] <Oath_Othelio> Was that cutaway a subtle loadscreen or am I crazy
[4:05:48] <Zombrocom> Changing to yellow stance from blue stance instant charges to level 3, which you can carry over to a wirebug move
[4:05:51] <Aydarkzero> i like how it just becomes a goddamn anchor
[4:05:51] <Blank9> launch a monster into another monster to instantly be able to ride them
[4:05:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> i think if you dash into another monster it downs it for mounting
[4:05:59] <butthurtdave> It does seem like the mount timers are a little /too/ lenient
[4:06:00] <Devbob98> Is this assault?
[4:06:02] <+wholehole> Has anyone tried the mulitplayer yet? With 4 Hunters and 4 Doggos, the tripping is REAL
[4:06:02] <+D00msDayDan> @Oath_Othelio it's just to teleport you onto the monster's back, it's not loading anything
[4:06:06] <blackbookalpha> They're sucking up all the Mako now excuse me while I kill this rabbit
[4:06:08] <%hrbeck_> wraggi is a cowboy
[4:06:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> *launch
[4:06:12] <%Nekros4442> NUMBER
[4:06:16] <p_squid> does anyone know if rise is going to have live service stuff like world?
[4:06:21] <+Grayhammatter> big number
[4:06:22] <Blank9> The mount timers go down when you're hit mainly.
[4:06:24] <%BoxNavy> yeah you can carry the insta level 3 charge over to the wirebug move or do the spin -> big bang combo
[4:06:36] <Blank9> Lets you sprint all across the map to track down another monster.
[4:06:38] <%captain_thickthighs> do combi
[4:06:39] <rasamune> All Monster Hunter games are technically live service games
[4:06:40] <%FlamingNarwhal> @p_squid you mean like updates and events and stuff? yes most monster hunter games do
[4:06:42] <+SimplyRandy> p_squid most likely, every mh has
[4:06:45] <Slim_Lipid> @p_squid they've just announced title update 2 LUL
[4:06:46] <DublinRage> Now that's what I call Big Damage!
[4:06:52] <+yourfriendtusks> BONK
[4:07:01] <DublinRage> *for low rank
[4:07:03] <%FlamingNarwhal> they already announced an update yeah
[4:07:07] <OneThousandTomatoes> @p_squid the title updates are free through
[4:07:14] <Oxybe> Bun Cannon!
[4:07:24] <+yoshkosh20> is that the hammer? that's pretty slick
[4:07:27] <Devbob98> This monster feels like something out of avatar
[4:07:27] <Aydarkzero> his ears are broken!
[4:07:34] <jotabranded> poor Lagombi
[4:07:38] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeye, big bang
[4:07:39] <TheRealNumberJ42> why does this starting hammer look so cool
[4:07:45] <%Das_Bass> Hammer pat?
[4:07:47] <blackbookalpha> Deaf Chungus
[4:07:47] <%BestTeaMaker> i felt that hit
[4:07:48] <%FlamingNarwhal> man I was SHOCKED lagombi wasnt in iceborne
[4:07:49] <%BestTeaMaker> ouch
[4:07:50] <Blank9> hammer is so cool
[4:07:54] <%MisterRockett> Hammer is so fucking good.
[4:07:56] <%WhereIsWill> psaBig bonks
[4:07:57] <DSD24> "I'm just getting started!"
[4:07:58] <%FlamingNarwhal> when they announced ice update i figured it was a shoo in
[4:08:11] <%BoxNavy> no theyre the same
[4:08:12] <UnfilteredComic> No
[4:08:28] <Blank9> They're the same in each stance
[4:08:29] <Devbob98> The sound effects are A+
[4:08:38] <UnfilteredComic> Its just a panic option if you wanna switch to yellow
[4:08:40] <%BoxNavy> the dodge is really tight. you can use it to get thru roars
[4:08:40] <%Monkeyweed21> switching to yellow lets you get to max charge instantly
[4:08:45] <rasamune> @FlamingNarwhal It was a real shame they never put the beast frame into World :<
[4:08:49] <%ThirdWelles> Vespoid stun incoming
[4:08:50] <+AWr00tBear> No
[4:08:51] <ExemplarKyle> Reject humanity, become monke and go full unga bunga with the hammer.
[4:08:51] <%ThirdWelles> I can feel it
[4:08:55] <Oxybe> Lagombi missing out on Icebone feels like a "we can only fit in so many mons and Lagombi is more early game" decision
[4:09:01] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah
[4:09:02] <butthurtdave> HAMMER CANCELS
[4:09:03] <TheRealNumberJ42> and it gets a dodge
[4:09:05] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[4:09:07] <%Nekros4442> now he's got it
[4:09:14] <ScreamLord> I'm so glad we have more than just Wyverns in this game
[4:09:20] <+Grayhammatter> now he's got it
[4:09:22] <Zombrocom> and you can cancel that into Impact Crater
[4:09:23] <%ThirdWelles> Pat you literally read that out loud to us when you were reading the tooltips
[4:09:26] <Blank9> it's way more fun than power charge
[4:09:27] <GengarUsedCut> good button
[4:09:28] <%Monkeyweed21> there are times you want the faster weaker yellow version too
[4:09:28] <Devbob98> It’d not clear tbh so easy to miss
[4:09:33] <%BoxNavy> @PatStaresAt the spin move leads into the big bang combo now after like 2-3 spins i think?
[4:09:34] <DublinRage> So what is that glowing thing by Pat a firefly?
[4:09:35] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Now he's thinking with hammers.
[4:09:41] <Lynxystem> FlamingNarwhal same but im glad they are back for rise chwT chwHype
[4:09:43] <butthurtdave> The variety is so nice.  I just hope we can get the really goofy ones like Zamtrios back
[4:09:44] <%FlamingNarwhal> @ThirdWelles reading doesnt always mean comprehending
[4:09:48] <%FlamingNarwhal> i know from experience
[4:09:49] <blackbookalpha> Eddie Gordo move out of nowhere
[4:09:55] <Zombrocom> He is healing himself
[4:09:58] <BentArcher> HareBear Drifting!?
[4:10:05] <%Monkeyweed21> @DublinRage holds all the little bufs you pick up in the field
[4:10:10] <Psyramics> @Oxybe It's more they didn't want to make the skeleton for it, when they could add the skeleton for Tigrex, Narca, Barioth
[4:10:10] <%FlamingNarwhal> im so glad to go back to older style MH just for the variety and craziness back
[4:10:11] <DovaDude29> Do you need to mount the dog to get the heals?
[4:10:16] <Devbob98> Just like the real gief
[4:10:18] <+BoltWarden> reading doesn't always convert directly to understanding
[4:10:23] <DublinRage> Oh ok ty
[4:10:23] <yoush03> this game has very nice music :)
[4:10:28] <DovaDude29> hes got a heal buff looking aura on himself atm, mount the dog?
[4:10:53] <Blank9> the wirebug spin attack launches you forward enough to kinda chase
[4:11:01] <butthurtdave> For real, if the music is this hype for regular monsters just imagine what the final boss monster's theme is gonna be like
[4:11:03] <%primarch_lupercal> did u accidently pick the self heal scroll
[4:11:22] <DovaDude29> mood
[4:11:25] <Oxybe> @Psyramics that also makes sense
[4:11:38] <Devbob98> Is was in fact, not the end
[4:11:39] <%Monkeyweed21> oh cool you dont get the spin attack in power charge
[4:11:39] <%WhereIsWill> did i already miss CB?
[4:11:43] <DovaDude29> doggy is eating up all the crunchy heals all to himself
[4:11:52] <ScreamLord> Man, I'm so used to using the clutch claw spin attack after the lvl 3 standing R2
[4:11:59] <+rottingpastry> elmo attac from rear
[4:12:01] <DSD24> He do be swinging
[4:12:08] <Vendigear> I think I'm starting to see the appeal of hammer
[4:12:11] <mostundesired> I'm waiting for this KO something fierce.
[4:12:13] <butthurtdave> Nah, he's done GS, GL, SnS, and DBs so far
[4:12:15] <GengarUsedCut> sorta wild how good this game looks graphically, which shouldnt be surprising for the switch but they never capitalize on its hardware capabilities
[4:12:15] <%BoxNavy> dont tell him what to do
[4:12:27] <+rottingpastry> the appeal of big heavy is broad
[4:12:28] <Devbob98> I love how he holds the ground when he slides
[4:12:38] <Blank9> the slam hits twice on impact if you get it right on
[4:12:42] <+mgoodinthehood> Is the hammer in this game just like the new Ultra Longsword in World?
[4:12:44] <Blank9> once for the hammer, once for shockwave
[4:12:44] <+Grayhammatter> hare drifting
[4:12:46] <rasamune> He swing he ass at you
[4:12:47] <%alcors_wisdom> aim for the head thats where all the stun is stored
[4:12:47] <sonicblade38> the gimick of the blades poping out is rad
[4:12:49] <%BoxNavy> @Vendigear hammers never been this in-depth before its seriously so cool now
[4:13:04] <%ThirdWelles> Did Rise get rid of the item wheel or is it still in?
[4:13:13] <rasamune> It's till in
[4:13:15] <DSD24> Its still in
[4:13:16] <Vendigear> still in
[4:13:16] <%BoxNavy> no thats still in
[4:13:18] <ScreamLord> He don't wanna
[4:13:18] <rasamune> *still
[4:13:18] <frostyjay3> @GengarUsedCut Capcom usually brings out the best in Nintendo consoles
[4:13:19] <Blank9> item wheel's still in
[4:13:19] <Oxybe> item wheel still there
[4:13:20] <DublinRage> Do you guys think Woolie's gonna name his Palamute "Friender"?
[4:13:20] <%ThirdWelles> rad
[4:13:24] <+Grayhammatter> still in, but you also have radial
[4:13:25] <Holycow8498> Lagombi will initial d on you rather than fall down
[4:13:26] <%YakumoYomi> Lagombi: "No u"
[4:13:34] <%ThirdWelles> That ping from the hammer reaching max is so fucking good
[4:13:40] <GengarUsedCut> @frostyjay3 very true
[4:13:45] <%YakumoYomi> No, he's limping
[4:13:45] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[4:13:46] <OneThousandTomatoes> SourPls
[4:13:49] <Blank9> it's so goofy but hammer might be the best mounting weapon in the game
[4:13:51] <UnfilteredComic> OOo i like that chase theme
[4:13:59] <%ThirdWelles> What the fuck why is this music so good
[4:14:06] <Oxybe> I wonder if you can rename your hired cats and dogs
[4:14:11] <Devbob98> That limp run makes me sad
[4:14:23] <EynosStyles> @oxybe you can, yes
[4:14:25] <juicycoldsteak> A bladed edge hammer should be illegal and be made into its own weapon class
[4:14:26] <%shinigami40297> shinigami40297 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[4:14:26] <DSD24> @Oxybe Yeah you can
[4:14:37] <+OnTheDonner> I hate how big the UI is, so that it can be played handheld. It's way too big for tv tho
[4:14:38] <DublinRage> Uh-oh, look out for Baggi back there

[4:18:26] <blackbookalpha> Parasol Bird
[4:18:30] <$JojoPiero> Aknosom has the best armor

[4:18:35] <Oxybe> aknosom is bird gang rep
[4:18:36] <Mojomoud> I think Aknosom is the Crane monster @PatStaresAt
[4:18:36] <Holycow8498> You'll see
[4:18:38] <koffeemancer> has cool armor too
[4:18:38] <%ThirdWelles> oooooooo
[4:18:38] <$JojoPiero> I'm aware it was only that one Frontier
[4:18:39] <OneThousandTomatoes> I love a lot of world but so much of the mh flavor just wasnt in that game
[4:18:40] <@SoFarFetched> geefBlank
[4:18:42] <+Grayhammatter> burb up
[4:18:43] <%ThirdWelles> Big Crane
[4:18:44] <pabloelenano2> BIRD UP
[4:18:44] <Slim_Lipid> wasn't ☂️ the one of the first they showed off
[4:18:46] <$JojoPiero> Frontier is still an earlier title
[4:18:49] <+The__Strongest> thats the one that gives you the cool knight armor I think
[4:18:49] <%solracc25> New Monster new Big number
[4:18:51] <@SoFarFetched> LEON!
[4:18:53] <+Left_Justified> atpBird
[4:18:54] <DovaDude29> @JojoPiero they were frontier only. same with i think the magnet spike
[4:18:55] <DublinRage> I am still salty about Brachy weapons in Iceborne
[4:18:58] <+Kduff89> This game looks so pretty compared to XX
[4:18:59] <+Akizea> based off of the umbrella you
[4:19:00] <%alcors_wisdom> has to hide from chris somehow
[4:19:01] <Holycow8498> Is the trading ship in every game called the Argosy?
[4:19:02] <+Grayhammatter> ADA!
[4:19:03] <+Goblinz_3> World just gave you lumps of metal with feathers on it for weapons
[4:19:03] <+Akizea> yokai*
[4:19:03] <yoishbedoish> shit guys am i about to lose hours to a new monster hunter game again
[4:19:06] <ScreamLord> It's based off of that goofy Japanese Umbrella demon
[4:19:11] <%YakumoYomi> @BoxNavy Apparently the lazy designs still exist for monsters that originated in World, but the other monsters
[4:19:13] <sonicblade38> how is the argosy still floating!?
[4:19:18] <%FlamingNarwhal> @OneThousandTomatoes ive always said world has a different soul than other monster hunters. its not ALL bad just different
[4:19:18] <Holycow8498> LEON I NEED YOU TO
[4:19:28] <blackbookalpha> Where's the big tree Pat can climb to get free items?
[4:19:29] <butthurtdave> I want to fight the sumo platypus so badly
[4:19:31] <Holycow8498> The Kamarou village theme is nice
[4:19:31] <DovaDude29> i wished that frontier wasnt so stingy with their contents. the game was closed down in 2018, they should bring some of its stuff tothe main game so its not forgotten
[4:19:32] <Oxybe> I took a week of vacation for this game. the hype is real
[4:19:34] <DSD24> Its so fuzzy!
[4:19:35] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:19:36] <%Monkeyweed21> THERE ONCE WAS A MAN NAMED CHRIS REDFIELD
[4:19:40] <butthurtdave> look at lagombi dog tho
[4:19:44] <+yourfriendtusks> wait, the baggi armor was cool
[4:19:45] <Blank9> just put a different hat on and it's good
[4:19:45] <yoishbedoish> does anyone know if the low rank in this feels as much of a grind as worlds? that was the main thing keeping me from replaying world on PC
[4:19:46] <+GrandmasterBFunk> The lagombi cat armour is real friggin cutte
[4:19:56] <OneThousandTomatoes> world is a lot more pragmatic in spirt
[4:19:57] <+Grayhammatter> lagom dog though?
[4:20:01] <%solracc25> Leon, Claire, and Ada cats soon
[4:20:02] <+datmegamandeeeee> arzuros set looks so comfy
[4:20:10] <%Monkeyweed21> Jaggi looks the best
[4:20:11] <iam_acasual> god I'm stoked to watch MHR for hours on end
[4:20:13] <Psyramics> is this the same skill system as World?
[4:20:16] <DublinRage> @PatStaresAt Aknosom is that bird from the first trailers
[4:20:17] <UnfilteredComic> Kulu had a decent lowrank set too
[4:20:22] <Zourath> Bleetzbol armor
[4:20:22] <%JoshManVGH> Is layered armor a thing right out the gate in the game?
[4:20:23] <Holycow8498> I am curious as to what the Izuchi weapons look like
[4:20:27] <Holycow8498> Kulu did have a good low rank set
[4:20:29] <Mojomoud> I deeply appreciate how much less materials it takes to make stuff in Rise
[4:20:35] <Mojomoud> I AM SO EXCITED FOR TOMORROW
[4:20:43] <%ThirdWelles> Aknosom do fire, btw

[4:30:30] <butthurtdave> He's giving me big quropeco vibes
[4:30:30] <HeWhoMonologues> Cheer500 The true reason this will surpass MHW is the ability to dress up a cat AND a dog. Thus fulfilling all possible fantasies a human could have.
[4:30:40] <%PettyFunk> I heard that the horn was way better in Rise? But I haven’t played it at all yet
[4:30:42] <DirtyMiser> Pat rolling HH? What a patrician

[4:31:03] <Kain5707> time to gear up
[4:31:05] <sonicblade38> or an SSJ YKK
[4:31:11] <Blank9> horn's only busted in the demo
[4:31:11] <DSD24> @BrickhouseArsh No classes just the weapon you pick

[4:31:18] <FatherGreyBeard> SourPls
[4:31:24] <HeWhoMonologues> Does being a solo horn main mean the self buffs are worth it?
[4:31:28] <%ThirdWelles> I googled Qurupeco spelling it wrong and got a bunch of gross furry shit
[4:31:35] <Zombrocom> Breakdance attack has I frames
[4:31:36] <%ThirdWelles> Time to uninstall chrome

[4:33:06] <tacostarvedbeast> this music reminds me of onimusha, love it
[4:33:08] <HeWhoMonologues> @Slim_Lipid And excellent point.
[4:33:16] <Vendigear> lots of unique animations on this bird
[4:33:23] <%solracc25> Song up?
[4:33:24] <Kain5707> thats a lot of Rath moves if you pay close attention
[4:33:25] <%FlamingNarwhal> MAN i hope malfestio is in this game
[4:33:28] <+Grayhammatter> uh oh, pissed bird
[4:33:28] <rReizs> horn has always been a weapon first and support second, SnS is by far the better "healer" weapons
[4:33:38] <akitanito> Swipe actually seems safe if you hug it
[4:33:38] <%moonmintparadise> What do you think your Main Weapon will be ?
[4:33:42] <blackbookalpha> health plant
[4:33:46] <%BoxNavy> or yian kut ku even
[4:33:48] <%alcors_wisdom> he kind of reminds me of puki puki
[4:33:51] <+skwerley> No such thing pat you can't modify the word "Unique"
[4:33:52] <butthurtdave> YEah, bouncing of Quro was the worst thing about it
[4:33:53] <%cvp5127> pat do your recovery
[4:33:55] <$JojoPiero> That was Yian Garuga
[4:33:58] <%Monkeyweed21> He's using crane stance martial arts @PatStaresAt
[4:34:00] <OneThousandTomatoes> yep that what I was thinking of queropecko
[4:34:05] <Zombrocom> He's like if yian kut ku was interesting
[4:34:06] <Sol_Install> pat hates healing
[4:34:08] <blackbookalpha> activate health plant
[4:34:12] <tacostarvedbeast> does this game kill old switches?
[4:34:13] <Vendigear> flying wyvern skeleton, nothing new there, but so many unique animations
[4:34:19] <HeWhoMonologues> Has switch axe been tried yet?
[4:34:28] <%BoxNavy> you dont remember kut ku? for shame
[4:34:28] <rReizs> does this guy deploy the konchu squad
[4:34:31] <Kain5707> an awful bird
[4:34:33] <tacostarvedbeast> that was rad
[4:34:38] <rasamune> @butthurtdave No, the worst part of Qurupeco was when he went "meow, meow, meow"
[4:34:39] <RGBgamesinc> i wanna see that face plate BUST
[4:34:39] <Zombrocom> Derpy fire chicken that breathes fire
[4:34:47] <Blank9> don't forget wirebug attacks
[4:34:47] <+Grayhammatter> that's pretty rad
[4:34:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> cool
[4:35:00] <tacostarvedbeast> gief just wants to show u he loves u
[4:35:01] <+Sw3g_J> gief with a foot fetish oh no
[4:35:02] <+rottingpastry> Paige, don't lick his feet
[4:35:05] <+N1netbattler> its kinda like a punch out boss
[4:35:05] <Blank9> zl+a is big damage
[4:35:08] <%asgard147> "Dad, gimme food" psaDogchamp
[4:35:11] <butthurtdave> god the infernal melody charges so fast
[4:35:15] <%WhereIsWill> I know theres a super crazy move HH does after that spin move but idk the button combo
[4:35:18] <%SenorCounter> Do it later Geif
[4:35:20] <VirtuaRailith> don't lick his feet paige
[4:35:20] <BlueSpartan119> ZL+A is super good
[4:35:21] <+Das_Prints> He’s helping.
[4:35:26] <%walternatorz> zangief is jealous
[4:35:32] <coracor> how big are the maps compared to world?
[4:35:34] <RGBgamesinc> 25 more minutes!!!
[4:35:40] <butthurtdave> I think you do the pefformance and hit ZR after immediately
[4:35:49] <HeWhoMonologues> So fan art of pat riding gief, exist already or no?
[4:36:00] <tacostarvedbeast> oh man gonna have to buy a pro controller to play this, my joy cons already garbage status
[4:36:06] <OneThousandTomatoes> smaller than world maps but bigger than old portable i think
[4:36:15] <+Sw3g_J> at least real gief doesnt have a knife... yetr
[4:36:18] <+Kiaayo> "gotta"
[4:36:18] <maglebeast> Sup Pat. how you liking Rise so far?
[4:36:22] <OneThousandTomatoes> theres also a lot more vertical mobility
[4:36:24] <%vaporousTippler> At least a Mayflash.
[4:36:30] <butthurtdave> Sharpen your horn, it sounds a little flat
[4:36:33] <%czeekytv> omg the song playing is so much faster
[4:36:42] <%czeekytv> @butthurtdave boooooooo good one
[4:36:45] <%SenorCounter> Really hope they announce a PC release sometime soon.

[4:37:02] <+lostdayz9> local baby man once again biffs it
[4:37:02] <+D00msDayDan> @SenorCounter it's already been announced for early 2020
[4:37:02] <%WhereIsWill> the OMNISHAMBLES
[4:37:05] <rReizs> PC was already confirmed a year later right
[4:37:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> @SenorCounter thay did, early 2022
[4:37:06] <+D00msDayDan> 2022 i mean fuck
[4:37:06] <BlueSpartan119> @SenorCounter PC 2022
[4:37:07] <maglebeast> I thought they already did announce a PC release?
[4:37:08] <koffeemancer> Pc release is next year
[4:37:08] <+Grayhammatter> the megabotch
[4:37:11] <iam_acasual> I'm so glad you're using the HH
[4:37:11] <Zombrocom> @SenorCounter They annoucned it for early 2022
[4:37:12] <%SaiyanShoto> I’m considering getting a converter for my PS4 controller only cause I kinda don’t like the pro controller
[4:37:12] <Mundkipz> any suggestions for a budget controller for this?  pro controllers so expensive and mine is drifting after a year of use
[4:37:13] <cosmicgoatee> this fight music is REALLY good
[4:37:15] <+Sw3g_J> pc wont be for like a year after at the least
[4:37:18] <blackbookalpha> almost there
[4:37:23] <%SenorCounter> Thank god
[4:37:27] <+rottingpastry> so you do specific attacks to build meter, then one move uses the meter to do thing?
[4:37:31] <+Sw3g_J> just pray for cross save
[4:37:32] <+Goblinz_3> LUL
[4:37:32] <Vendigear> dang this things animations are just fascinating to watch
[4:37:37] <+Sw3g_J> hades did it why cant monster hunter
[4:37:38] <%cvp5127> god the slinger sucked
[4:37:41] <+rottingpastry> but you have to build in a specific order?
[4:37:50] <%BoxNavy> oh right pat remember you can tech out of being hit with zr+b
[4:37:54] <iam_acasual> god this looks so fun
[4:37:55] <maglebeast> pretty much
[4:37:57] <Animal_Farm4> I actually really dislike the new moveset
[4:38:00] <Discount_CJ> @maglebeast they didn't accounce it, it was leaked that it would come to PC
[4:38:03] <EynosStyles> @mundkipz buy a wired hori one. $20
[4:38:03] <%JoshManVGH> Looks like the lead composer for this game was Satoshi Hori, who was the composer for RE7. This is all live orchestra stuff with coruses
[4:38:08] <Animal_Farm4> I like the slow deliberate horn feel more than the slipperiness of this one
[4:38:15] <Sol_Install> It's nice to see Lord Shen making a come back
[4:38:16] <tacostarvedbeast> i could never figure out what to play in world, now that hunting horn looks more fun gonna dabble in literally all weapons
[4:38:18] <Mundkipz> any suggestions for a budget controller for switch?  my pro controller is drifting after a year of use
[4:38:18] <%Monkeyweed21> I miss encores but its way smoother
[4:38:21] <Zombrocom> They HAVE offically announced the PC version of rise now
[4:38:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> they did anounce a pc realease officially, just a while after the leak
[4:38:30] <%SaiyanShoto> Watching this just makes think how RE Engine is so good
[4:38:33] <Zombrocom> The breakdance attack has I frames btw
[4:38:35] <Discount_CJ> Oh really?
[4:38:36] <Slim_Lipid> it's kinda weird not having all of your moves accessible all the time on horn
[4:38:37] <%killsareFALL0UT> aye yo get em pat
[4:38:41] <HeWhoMonologues> Well, I feel like cross save is a no brainer but... Nintendo...
[4:38:49] <maglebeast> RE Engine is doing good work
[4:38:55] <%solracc25> Big horn
[4:38:56] <+Sw3g_J> again hades did it
[4:38:59] <blackbookalpha> best use when monster is down
[4:39:01] <Blank9> I don't like new hh at all
[4:39:03] <%BoxNavy> @Mundkipz uhh the sn30pro is supposedly good. you can also get a mayflash or whatever its called and use that with a ps4 or xbox controller
[4:39:06] <Sol_Install> NICE
[4:39:09] <butthurtdave> I wonder if we'll ever get that Dragon's Dogma 2 announcement :(
[4:39:09] <tacostarvedbeast> why would break dance have I frames? is it counting it like dodging in place?
[4:39:10] <Vendigear> nice shot elmo!
[4:39:12] <blackbookalpha> time to go ham
[4:39:14] <Zombrocom> I can't believe this is the same engine as RE2
[4:39:17] <%crazyspartan214> hell yeah elmo
[4:39:18] <+necrocannibal2> the good thing about this being a Switch game, it'll run fine in my potato PC
[4:39:27] <%TigerCatGo> Back from Dinner and he's STILL PLAYING!! SWEET!! PogChamp PogChamp
[4:39:27] <RGBgamesinc> i dont think cross save is gonna happen cause thats a feature of the nintendo online i doubt they'd want to cross contaminate that
[4:39:42] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt "RIP Fortnite" is trending on Twitter right now. I think you killed it
[4:39:44] <connerhozer> Also same engine as DMC 5, it’s incredible
[4:39:47] <%WhereIsWill> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[4:39:47] <akitanito> Gief and Elmo confirmed to be better hunters than Pat
[4:39:50] <+Sw3g_J> rip dragons dogma 2 id rather wait longer for a dmc 6 to get it but i doubt thats gonna happen
[4:39:51] <LiulfrJ> divinity os2 had cross save with switch and steam
[4:39:51] <maglebeast> Really hoping they add an Amaterasu costume for your pup. would be so cool in this game
[4:39:53] <+necrocannibal2> anyone still remembers Pantha Rei? lol
[4:39:55] <+Left_Justified> gotta B sharp atpRtsd4

[4:40:13] <+CapnClassix> @BoxNavy @Mundkipz I use the SN30 Pro+. Fantastic controller. Works great with Switch
[4:40:14] <+bobfriskit> @RGBgamesinc who knows? Hades on switch had cross play
[4:40:15] <+Sw3g_J> proved the game is for babies
[4:40:18] <%BoxNavy> yeah. youre too old for the game and youre cramping everyones style
[4:40:20] <%walternatorz> yes, pat. it's your fault.
[4:40:24] <tacostarvedbeast> or maybe its rip since u cant get the chun li butt anymore?
[4:40:24] <%WhereIsWill> probablly
[4:40:26] <karovus> did pat kill fortnite?
[4:40:28] <+thechungiestofbois> #deadgame

[4:40:59] <butthurtdave> Jeez this guy has a lot more breakable parts than I expected
[4:41:00] <DSD24> Didn't Chun Li always had a big ass?

[4:41:24] <tacostarvedbeast> did pat mess with nioh 2 much? couldn't get into nioh 1, but nioh 2 def doing it for me right now

[4:41:36] <+Kiaayo> @CurrySauseBandit it's basically a brand new weapon
[4:41:36] <Blank9> it's unga
[4:41:39] <@SoFarFetched> think he did two streams or so of Nioh 2
[4:41:45] <@SoFarFetched> but I dont know if he's messed with it since
[4:41:46] <HeWhoMonologues> So mounting a monster in Rise is only possible via wire bug and not jumping now?
[4:41:51] <Blank9> you don't have all your moves available at all times, it has canned combos now
[4:41:52] <coracor> yeah you dab on that not!velociprey
[4:42:08] <CurrySauseBandit> @Kiaayo Oh...i'm not sure if that's good or bad. Old HH was fun.

[4:56:14] <thesubgenius912> I thought this was going to be like the first episode of the MHW LP, all training all day
[4:56:22] <Vendigear> ooooh
[4:56:29] <+TheBitingIrish> wut
[4:56:35] <Oxybe> some of the switch skills are dope AF.
[4:56:38] <dan_g_v> nice
[4:56:39] <DSD24> That's rad
[4:56:39] <WeebFever> more of just a guard than a guard point, really
[4:56:39] <butthurtdave> does it eat sharpness?
[4:56:43] <Vendigear> shoulder check looks easier to use, but that's still great
[4:56:46] <+lostdayz9> YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH  YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
[4:56:50] <tacostarvedbeast> seems solid, timing that shoulder tackle was tricky in world
[4:56:54] <blackbookalpha> Rocket Lance is BACK
[4:56:56] <rReizs> eeeh regular tackle is defensive enough and faster
[4:56:57] <sonicblade38> @butthurtdave its a block u dope
[4:57:03] <%KineticZen> That is ipretty incredible
[4:57:08] <%Jekado> can you get... carted here?

[4:57:15] <DSD24> Looks cool too
[4:57:15] <OneThousandTomatoes> I thought that some of the datamined switch skills were weird

[4:57:47] <%JoshManVGH> so....you can customize for monsters even further
[4:57:48] <WeebFever> @Jekado You could also technically cart yourself in the MHW training area using the bombs. All it does it set you back to the are entrance.

[5:11:14] <+Grayhammatter> wait a minute... what
[5:11:14] <+BlakeLocked> wait what
[5:11:14] <ScreamLord> Some of these basic bitch weapons look like mid to end game for other games
[5:11:16] <%FlamingNarwhal> classic HH
[5:11:18] <Blank9> it's just press ZR after a single note to get song effects
[5:11:20] <Saltmeisterr> HUH?
[5:11:21] <+Vigonept> wait what
[5:11:23] <%charp35> its just old hunting horn
[5:11:24] <%Taisuru> Hm?
[5:11:25] <+Vigonept> ah
[5:11:25] <Blank9> not at all classic hh
[5:11:26] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt I just beat Magna in the demo for the first time. It was dirty, and it was my 137th attempt, but I got him PogChamp
[5:11:31] <BlueSpartan119> it's like 3rd HH i think?
[5:11:32] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah this is what I thought, its more like old hh
[5:11:33] <Zombrocom> Ohh, it just straight up goes back to old hunting horn
[5:11:39] <%WhereIsWill> waht
[5:11:39] <%TheWinged7> its clasic horn
[5:11:43] <%FlamingNarwhal> its classic HH
[5:11:43] <%JoshManVGH> Is digital release not accounting for DST?
[5:11:43] <%Taisuru> Classic HH
[5:11:47] <Oxybe> Neat
[5:11:48] <+BlakeLocked> Oh! Classic horn!
[5:11:49] <+yourfriendtusks> ohhhhh
[5:11:52] <Mattais88> WHY?!
[5:11:53] <+yourfriendtusks> no one has any reason to be angry anymore
[5:11:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> Nice
[5:11:57] <Vendigear> interesting. and appreaciated
[5:11:58] <Oxybe> That's actually cool
[5:12:07] <Blank9> you have a lot of reason to be angry
[5:12:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> @snaggletusks oh we'll find something
[5:12:11] <butthurtdave> i dont see a difference, am i stupid
[5:12:11] <@SoFarFetched> Capcom just put out a tweet saying " For North, Central and South America regions, Monster Hunter Rise will be available on the Nintendo eShop in a few hours." LUL
[5:12:11] <tacostarvedbeast> they will find a way to be upset
[5:12:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> this is what the datamine was talking about
[5:12:13] <Blank9> it's a single note song and the recital's still gone
[5:12:21] <Oxybe> HH isn't my jam but it's nice for peeps who like it
[5:12:21] <DublinRage> Were ppl angry before?
[5:12:22] <danknugglit> Doot Doot
[5:12:32] <$SGrim> If chord still has I-frames, then that's a straight upgrade
[5:12:39] <dan_g_v> it just works
[5:12:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> Enchore is gone but still nice
[5:12:55] <%JoshManVGH> @sofarfetched psaWhat
[5:13:02] <ScreamLord> Rise HH feels like a goddman DMC weapon
[5:13:04] <%isolex_> @SoFarFetched Why do you do this to me
[5:13:07] <Bloxus> no armor dance that I can see though
[5:13:16] <+koroshi60> can you sitll get 2 onte and a
[5:13:18] <%JoshManVGH> But... want play. Now!
[5:13:19] <mostundesired> It's also more sick styling sadistic.
[5:13:20] <%Monkeyweed21> encores and long recitals are still gone @PatStaresAt
[5:13:20] <@SoFarFetched> geefPoint look you go to capcom for them shenanigans, I aint holding Monhun Rise hostage
[5:13:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt ACTUALLY PAT that is a hunting horn play its just hard to get
[5:13:34] <tacostarvedbeast> not gonna like, no zilch about HH
[5:13:34] <Blank9> it used to be recital where you had at least 6 variations of it.
[5:13:40] <@SoFarFetched> or am I? geefThink
[5:13:42] <+Vigonept> theres the kick
[5:13:54] <+AcidRelic> They made hunting horn more damaging to get more people to use it
[5:13:56] <%isolex_> @SoFarFetched your the bearer of bad news, i'm shooting the messenger sajamStreet sajamStreet
[5:13:56] <%JoshManVGH> psaGib
[5:13:59] <$OfficerMods> Ok so how do we destroy the west coast guys?
[5:14:01] <%Taisuru> I'll be sticking with NewHorn personally :V
[5:14:02] <butthurtdave> I feel stupid cuz I dont see a difference
[5:14:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt There is some surprising depth to old hh
[5:14:08] <%YakumoYomi> @SoFarFetched SUS
[5:14:09] <@SoFarFetched> geefChair I will fight back
[5:14:11] <+koroshi60> now there's 2 hunting horns
[5:14:20] <Vendigear> swaxe isnt that different from World
[5:14:21] <@SoFarFetched> geefChair geefChair geefChair geefCahir
[5:14:23] <CurrySauseBandit> Guy that didn't play Hunting Horn, says stuff about Hunting Horn.
[5:14:23] <@SoFarFetched> geefChair *
[5:14:26] <@SoFarFetched> almost dropped my chair
[5:14:30] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeye, wild swing
[5:14:30] <danknugglit> The combat and mobility in this look so fun
[5:14:32] <CurrySauseBandit> Classic.
[5:14:36] <Blank9> HH's not been made better in the main game, it was just overtuned for the demo.
[5:14:38] <EynosStyles> NA game releases at 2am eastern time.
[5:14:47] <+RogueCrocodile> Capcom won’t let me in
[5:14:55] <EynosStyles> they seriously lied about 12 am fml
[5:14:59] <+bobfriskit> axe use to auto switch after wild swing
[5:15:01] <+Grayhammatter> capcom why do you do this!?
[5:15:02] <blackbookalpha> This some Bleach Bankai shit
[5:15:07] <Blank9> The big thing for SA this time around is in sword mode, your elemental discharge while holding down does insane damage and fires fast.
[5:15:10] <%JoshManVGH> @eynosstyles TearGlove
[5:15:12] <tacostarvedbeast> u just never stop
[5:15:12] <rReizs> 12AM my time
[5:15:15] <mostundesired> The flow is unreal.
[5:15:16] <OneThousandTomatoes> thats a sick swax
[5:15:22] <+the___moustache> No midnight unlock makes me pissed.
[5:15:25] <Vendigear> @bobfriskit I'm so glad they removed that
[5:15:27] <+GrandmasterBFunk> YOu get elemtal attacks in axe mode now
[5:15:32] <DublinRage> heyjayBirdup
[5:15:32] <%Ghufufin> PHIAL CHARGE
[5:15:34] <%Taisuru> They added phial to axe mode
[5:15:36] <+Vigonept> discharge?
[5:15:37] <+tigerfang86> ZERO SUM
[5:15:41] <Vendigear> @PatStaresAt amped sword mode. Phials discharge twice
[5:15:45] <tacostarvedbeast> switch axe user plus a hammer user, a match made in heaven
[5:15:45] <%YakumoYomi> Probably want it to be the 26th for all of NA, so 12am PST/3am EST
[5:15:47] <%WhereIsWill> HYPE
[5:15:50] <+Vigonept> phial to axe?!
[5:15:50] <%Dapper_Cactuar> PHIAL EFFECT IN AXE FORM
[5:15:51] <%Ghufufin> zero sum discharge yay
[5:15:51] <Blank9> zero sum discharge is actually worse than regular discharge
[5:15:53] <Zombrocom> Both modes get the power up now
[5:15:54] <BlueSpartan119> well looks like it will be 4am EST
[5:15:54] <blackbookalpha> Ceaseless Discharge
[5:16:01] <Blank9> regular discharge you can cancel out of
[5:16:03] <+bobfriskit> @Vendigear i kind of liked it, made switching faster for me. but I've only play world so
[5:16:08] <+koroshi60> watching pat lab while loosing my mind like eric andre
[5:16:16] <%WhereIsWill> silk moves?
[5:16:18] <EynosStyles> It's also for the north, south and central America no game till 2am. capcom you clowning us
[5:16:34] <%JoshManVGH> Whelp... goonna get up in a handful of hours to play before work then
[5:16:49] <+xemnahort> Ftr Nintendo is the one who unlocks games iirc
[5:17:04] <+GrandmasterBFunk> You fill up two meters Pat, one is the Sword meter, that is raised by attacking with the axe, that lets you use the sword, then when you attack with the sword you raise your amped state gauge, which when filled lets you use the zero sum discharge, and all of your attacks get an extra attack to it
[5:17:16] <+BlakeLocked> Well, guess I am going to bed for a while. Later!
[5:17:25] <millionstabz> Game is still not unlocked, goddammit Nintendo
[5:17:25] <+the___moustache> Might as well just go to sleep and wake up a few hours before work to get some playtime in.
[5:17:26] <LordOfThePoultry> criss cross slam boosts the charge rate
[5:17:37] <EynosStyles> @yakumoyomi even tho they had everyone say it was going to release 12am est. then like 8 minutes they decided to change their minds.
[5:17:38] <Blank9> it's a lot easier than you'd expect
[5:17:48] <+Shubreaker> oooooooooo
[5:17:48] <RyanGelatin> is this a good monhun to get into since itll be the zeitgeist or should iplay another one
[5:17:54] <DublinRage> How is it a gambit if you're invincible?
[5:17:54] <%JumboCrunchies> Im assuming they just forgot Daylight Savings time existed.
[5:17:55] <+the___moustache> It's a fucking dive kick.
[5:17:58] <Blank9> just get in sword and AAX, AAX
[5:18:02] <+GrandmasterBFunk> it's literally just "hit with thing until thing get better\
[5:18:06] <%WhereIsWill> thats dope!
[5:18:07] <Saltmeisterr> COOL
[5:18:08] <+Grayhammatter> whoa
[5:18:08] <+tigerfang86> did you just fuckin DIVEKICK
[5:18:09] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Just finished a online tournament. so glad to see Pat still on
[5:18:20] <millionstabz> "A midnight release would be good, so lets not do that" Some Nintendo fucker, probably
[5:18:23] <+senpairiq> im so frustrated I can't play til 3
[5:18:26] <Zombrocom> Switchaxe is actually a pretty straight forward weapon. You unga and bunga. No defense is only thing that makes it hard to use
[5:18:32] <%Monkeyweed21> dont forget to buff the axe
[5:18:39] <Blank9> Try elemental discharge before your gauge is filled up, and hold back while mashing it.
[5:18:47] <$Afterman_> i cant believe monhun doesnt unlock until like 3 am est in america region
[5:18:48] <KingVantq> Capcom screwing the America launch completely got us waiting til its the 26th in Alaska or something tdogTrigger
[5:18:57] <LiulfrJ> you can do it after launching yourself off of a zero sum discharge, too
[5:18:57] <+Vigonept> after wild swing do an x right?
[5:18:58] <Blank9> damn
[5:18:59] <LordOfThePoultry> axe gets the buffs as well
[5:19:02] <+Kenzo2000> AAAA X to buff axe
[5:19:03] <%Monkeyweed21> A A A X
[5:19:06] <Blank9> you still have the zero sum thing messing with it
[5:19:06] <+bobfriskit> Wild swing axe then overhead
[5:19:06] <rasamune> @RyanGelatin All Monster Hunter games except like, Dynamic Hunting are good to play
[5:19:08] <Vendigear> swaxe has no "defense option" but it gives you that sweet sweet short hop
[5:19:08] <+GrandmasterBFunk> Do the wild swings, then use the finisher on X, it makes you gain amped meter better
[5:19:10] <Zombrocom> In world it was three wild swings into a normal attack
[5:19:16] <rasamune> And I don't know if you can even play Dynamic Hunting anymore
[5:19:17] <%kyh9> How's Gunlance?
[5:19:22] <KingVantq> @Afterman_ fr shit released midnight everywhere else
[5:19:23] <EynosStyles> @jumbocrunchies I don't think that the case since capcom na that made the announcement.
[5:19:27] <+the___moustache> Have to swing at least 3 times though.
[5:19:30] <+Kenzo2000> now the meter charges faster
[5:19:34] <%Dapper_Cactuar> the Overhead Slam was added in Iceborne
[5:19:35] <+GrandmasterBFunk> That buff just increases how fast you fill up the amped gauge
[5:19:40] <$Afterman_> @KingVantq  i am very very annoyed tbh
[5:19:49] <koffeemancer> I think you can dive kick off a zero sum discharge @PatStaresAt
[5:19:52] <EynosStyles> same here
[5:19:58] <+G0rdian> what did i miss so far? is GS cool/better??
[5:20:09] <Zombrocom> Advancing slash can go into discharge I think
[5:20:20] <+SteinsApprentice> So the dive kick should do more than 23 damage this time
[5:20:23] <Vendigear> I actually don't like the amped axe, it gives me analysis paralysis on which mode to use when
[5:20:25] <+MK_Ineptitude> can anyone confirm if cutscenes are skippable?
[5:20:25] <koffeemancer> like use the silk bind while youre flying through the air
[5:20:26] <+Shubreaker> oh boy here we gooooo
[5:20:28] <+Grayhammatter> pizza cutter time?
[5:20:29] <+the___moustache> My main!
[5:20:30] <%WhereIsWill> CB yeyeye
[5:20:32] <EynosStyles> literally watch pat play the game in Canada but everyone else in the Americas not for us
[5:20:32] <PleaseCallMeSugar> "this fuckin thing" is right, pat
[5:20:39] <%MisterRockett> Time for the real weapon!
[5:20:42] <OneThousandTomatoes> I think theres a pizza cutter
[5:20:44] <rasamune> The Weapon of Kings
[5:20:52] <LordOfThePoultry> didn't they get rid of chainsaw mode?
[5:20:59] <Vendigear> hold A from the reload animation
[5:21:00] <+xemnahort> @eynosstyles pretty sure pat got an early copy
[5:21:01] <OneThousandTomatoes> charge vials the x?
[5:21:05] <%TheWinged7> IIRD cancel elemental discharge in axe mode?
[5:21:05] <%FlamingNarwhal> hold x during charge
[5:21:06] <OneThousandTomatoes> then*
[5:21:09] <sonicblade38> @PatStaresAt hold X while chargeing philes
[5:21:10] <+Vigonept> hold...x? after charging the shield right?
[5:21:10] <%Monkeyweed21> hold X while reloading
[5:21:12] <+Kenzo2000> The new axe basically requiring a buff to get into amped gets me killed because I feel like can't take a break to heal or
[5:21:13] <Botman_R> Hold X after loading Phials
[5:21:13] <EynosStyles> hold the charge
[5:21:14] <KingVantq> @LordOfThePoultry its a skill now
[5:21:16] <%MooseIsGoose> You charge it in the axe mode I thought
[5:21:18] <Vendigear> oh, X whoops
[5:21:22] <%RyanGelatin> RyanGelatin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Hey pat, been watching your stuff since elementary school and now im 19 working on a compilation of all of the podcast stuff. thanks for making dumb videos and getting me into like half the games i play today (yakLAD, FFXIV, p4g etc.) Hope gief gets treat
[5:21:23] <DovaDude29> Ey yo it’s midnight, but I can’t play the game?
[5:21:25] <koffeemancer> hold x when charging phials
[5:21:28] <%Monkeyweed21> X
[5:21:30] <Zombrocom> uh, I don't know switch controls, but hold the light attack while doing a charge
[5:21:31] <sonicblade38> @PatStaresAt only works if shield is charged
[5:21:33] <+Grayhammatter> yeyeye
[5:21:35] <+FranKu360> IS THE GAME OUT RN?????
[5:21:38] <rReizs> west coast midnight

[5:21:59] <%MadPretty> I want to get this but only have a switch lite and I am worried it's gonna destroy my hands
[5:22:06] <+spades3> i singlehandedly hate this weapon and yet love it as well

[5:22:14] <@SoFarFetched> on their twitter
[5:22:15] <%FlamingNarwhal> im so upset they made us wait till midnight eastern
[5:22:17] <+the___moustache> The best weapon when you need to break and cut everything!
[5:22:18] <KingVantq> @rReizs Seems they're using Alaska time since its gonna be 1am west coast for launch
[5:22:19] <%JumboCrunchies> According to a countdown on Nintendo's page
[5:22:27] <+Kenzo2000> Guess I'll put three more hours into the demo lol
[5:22:27] <+yourfriendtusks> @MadPretty put pop sockets on the back, it helped me a lot
[5:22:28] <BlackMage66652> WHY THE FUCK IS AMERICA DELAYED
[5:22:31] <%FlamingNarwhal> guess im waking up early and playing before work

[5:23:04] <%Dapper_Cactuar> savage axe mode from Iceborne
[5:23:04] <+D00msDayDan> oh it's a shortcut to savage axe
[5:23:04] <%MadPretty> @snaggletusks Thanks for the tip. Good shit
[5:23:06] <rasamune> Savage Mode is the Switch Skill babyyyyyyyyyyy
[5:23:06] <%toastybites> savage axe from iceborne
[5:23:06] <%TheWinged7> BB leaking into MH
[5:23:07] <+G0rdian> SAWBLADE?!
[5:23:09] <%YakumoYomi> That was in Iceborne as a regular part of the moveset
[5:23:11] <blackbookalpha> fidget spinner shield
[5:23:14] <+yourfriendtusks> OOOOOH BOY
[5:23:15] <%JoshManVGH> Oh they kept it
[5:23:16] <%Monkeyweed21> buff the axe mode instead of the sword
[5:23:17] <%MisterRockett> You didn't see it spinning when you had both charged and was doing your elemental discharge?
[5:23:18] <Ner234> YOO
[5:23:18] <+Das_Prints> Ah that’s the stuff from Iceborne.
[5:23:18] <dan_g_v> hee hee, axe goes brrr
[5:23:22] <%isolex_> CUT ME A PIECE A PIE PAT
[5:23:22] <$OfficerMods> thats how it was in world
[5:23:23] <stormhawk9891> WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT
[5:23:27] <%JoshManVGH> im so happy
[5:23:38] <+D00msDayDan> do it when you have phials
[5:23:40] <%Monkeyweed21> Fake MH fan
[5:23:43] <blackbookalpha> full phials go BOOM
[5:23:44] <+Kenzo2000> OH that sticks
[5:23:45] <+the___moustache> Charge Blade got a buzzsaw move way back in GU.
[5:23:46] <+Grayhammatter> oh my god
[5:23:53] <%FlamingNarwhal> its a bit different than world where oyu buffed shield then sword then into chainsaw mode. but nice to see chainsaw mode is still here
[5:23:54] <Reborn2killu> it add tick damage to the attacks
[5:23:54] <%TheWinged7> turns axe from big hit into buzzsaw on stick
[5:23:57] <Psyramics> it regens phials in axe mode, wtf
[5:23:57] <+Kharinite> that thing fucks pretty hard
[5:23:57] <JaerHQ> this looks so sick
[5:23:58] <%WhereIsWill> its charging phials too!
[5:23:59] <+D00msDayDan> GOD THAT HITSTOP
[5:24:00] <$StrawberryPantsu> What a Secondary lol
[5:24:02] <+Nautilus_Bot> It runs on phials
[5:24:05] <BlueSpartan119> in IB it drained phials but now it builds them up
[5:24:06] <rReizs> it was the biggest thing in iceborne, shat on alatreon elements
[5:24:07] <%YakumoYomi> Pizza cutter was mainly for elemental damage in Iceborne
[5:24:07] <+Das_Prints> Big Pizza Cutter
[5:24:08] <%JoshManVGH> axe big buff, do SED
[5:24:09] <%MooseIsGoose> what is the point of the saw does it break parts easier
[5:24:10] <rasamune> What's there to be confused about. You have a buzzsaw. Saw shit
[5:24:12] <Ner234> Kreygasm
[5:24:13] <+Nautilus_Bot> OHHHHH
[5:24:13] <%Dapper_Cactuar> it was added so people used axe form for attacks other than amped elemental discharge
[5:24:16] <+ALazo> this weapon is so cool
[5:24:17] <+emoprawn> bayonetta
[5:24:19] <Virokwet> sick af
[5:24:33] <%Monkeyweed21> You lose the sword buff but get pizza cutter on axe mode
[5:24:45] <AmuserName> Is that the Dante motorcycle swords?
[5:24:48] <+Sw3g_J> bummer that u can only get saw blade axe or light saber sword tho
[5:24:49] <BlueSpartan119> Iceborne it ran on phials, Rise it builds them up
[5:24:50] <danknugglit> THATS RAD
[5:24:59] <+Sw3g_J> having both in iceborne was wild
[5:25:00] <+Vigonept> it makes it so that aed isnt the end all right?
[5:25:01] <Zombrocom> It regens phials over time in savage axe mode
[5:25:01] <+bobfriskit> are vials coming back??
[5:25:05] <PleaseCallMeSugar> this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen
[5:25:05] <danknugglit> Pizza cutter mode
[5:25:06] <diontmack> that hitstop is so CHUNKY
[5:25:07] <+D00msDayDan> oh god it's charging phials as it attacks i'm gonna bust a nut
[5:25:10] <%MisterRockett> I like Charge Blade it's all about managing resources to do the big hits but it CAN get exhausting as your "main" weapon to constantly be managing vials.
[5:25:11] <%bevyrage> BLOODBORN AW YEAH
[5:25:11] <kentrix11> Pizza cutter from bloodborne
[5:25:12] <rReizs> iceborne version ran on vials but this is different
[5:25:13] <blackbookalpha> you can discharge all phials for big damage
[5:25:14] <Reborn2killu> in iceborne the phials where a timmer
[5:25:15] <OneThousandTomatoes> it builds phials wtf
[5:25:20] <+Grayhammatter> super chunky hitstop
[5:25:24] <%zv1neda> It regenerates phials on the chainsaw hits
[5:25:24] <%JoshManVGH> oooooooh that's tasty
[5:25:25] <+the___moustache> The buzzsaw Hunter Art in GU was fucking nuts.
[5:25:27] <+xemnahort> Oh shit time to pick up swaxe
[5:25:33] <WeebFever> the smelliest weapon
[5:25:34] <%FlamingNarwhal> @MisterRockett CB is a good pocket weapon imo
[5:25:37] <BlackMage66652> @PatStaresAt How's Gunlance?
[5:25:41] <%FlamingNarwhal> like you said it can be a pain sometimes
[5:25:42] <+the___moustache> Charge Blade
[5:25:44] <blackbookalpha> the floor is lava
[5:25:45] <sonicblade38> i wanst gunna use cb kuz didnt like silk binds,...changed my mind now
[5:25:45] <%JoshManVGH> So fucking cool
[5:25:47] <@SoFarFetched> This was capcoms apology for making the weapons look ugly in MHW and Iceborne geefSmugAF
[5:25:47] <$Afterman_> hahah rise doesnt come out until ACTUALLY 4 AM est in NA
[5:25:47] <+Grayhammatter> get that goo
[5:25:55] <+ALazo> slow bug :(
[5:25:55] <DudeDern> !uptime
[5:25:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 26m.
[5:25:56] <OneThousandTomatoes> I think the jump back changes if the datamines were correct
[5:25:57] <PleaseCallMeSugar> the perfect Quebecois weapon
[5:25:57] <Saltmeisterr> what about BULLET?
[5:25:59] <+Das_Prints> It’s all blade
[5:26:00] <tattleworm> head red, belly yellow
[5:26:07] <+xemnahort> Oh wait that was charge blade not swaxe lol
[5:26:10] <danknugglit> All the weapons are way more stylish than world
[5:26:12] <%Monkeyweed21> the loss of kinsect feeding is a big nerf
[5:26:22] <ECRead> did they nerf the glaive in this one too?
[5:26:22] <OneThousandTomatoes> head, body, limbs
[5:26:33] <+the___moustache> I've hated Insect Glaive since it came out in 4U.
[5:26:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> or was it head, body, tail?
[5:26:36] <Zombrocom> Yeah, that sure is IG alright
[5:26:38] <Blank9> IG's still ok but it's just literally the same thing as base world
[5:26:53] <+Grayhammatter> that's an IG alright
[5:26:57] <Blank9> they didn't add shit but a forward jump and backwards jump
[5:26:58] <BlueSpartan119> YUP
[5:26:58] <%FlamingNarwhal> insect glaive got fucking lame ass wirebug moves
[5:27:03] <%FlamingNarwhal> it sucks
[5:27:04] <+koroshi60> you can use it in air any direction
[5:27:04] <Zombrocom> IG pretty much only lost things from iceborne
[5:27:05] <%YakumoYomi> Yeah, IG didn't get much in Rise
[5:27:08] <%JoshManVGH> what is "gravity"
[5:27:16] <BlueSpartan119> it get's the dragoon dive as a switch skill later tho
[5:27:19] <OneThousandTomatoes> stamina regent also is faster with the jump back
[5:27:20] <DublinRage> Question: If i pre-order digital Rise, does it auto DL or do i have to open Nintendo shop?
[5:27:23] <%TheWinged7> it heals your team too
[5:27:23] <connerhozer> Literally nothing new for insect Glaive
[5:27:27] <yuber_> wait till later loool
[5:27:31] <Blank9> the dive was part of the normal moveset in IB
[5:27:32] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt You can stick the insect glavie into the wall
[5:27:33] <$Sdeje> Support Kinsect
[5:27:35] <%Monkeyweed21> IG lost moves from Iceborne
[5:27:36] <+zzNamttamzz> team player now
[5:27:39] <%FlamingNarwhal> @DublinRage mine downloaded without me doing anything
[5:27:42] <OneThousandTomatoes> i was wrong
[5:27:44] <%FlamingNarwhal> but i bought it ages ago
[5:27:44] <DublinRage> I've never pre-ordered on Switch b4
[5:27:55] <+FranKu360> love ya chat thanks for showinng me twitter
[5:27:58] <%YakumoYomi> With Red
[5:28:00] <%FlamingNarwhal> might be trouble now with switch server being hammered from people trying to play
[5:28:01] <Zombrocom> You swap out tornado slash? Wild
[5:28:13] <Aydarkzero> has he checked SnS changes yet?
[5:28:17] <sonicblade38> mindnight EST my ass still gotta wait for midnight here
[5:28:17] <Vendigear> fancy, but not much of a change
[5:28:17] <%isolex_> its just a lightsaber
[5:28:26] <+the___moustache> Can't play the digital copy for another 4-5 hours though.
[5:28:27] <Zombrocom> ...meh?
[5:28:31] <Vendigear> it looks cool, but isnt it just the same?
[5:28:33] <%Monkeyweed21> it marks like the ZR attack
[5:28:33] <+Grayhammatter> launch your kinsect
[5:28:36] <rReizs> tornado moves you forward and tetra stays in place
[5:28:37] <Blank9> it's a weaker attack combo that takes longer but marks the enemy
[5:28:42] <+koroshi60> its suppose to comomb with kinsects later on once you upgrade the bug
[5:28:44] <OneThousandTomatoes> not as shocking
[5:28:44] <+Shubreaker> see the cloud it makes
[5:28:45] <BlueSpartan119> @sonicblade38 it's gonna be 4am EST, so 1am if your pacific
[5:28:47] <Blank9> but you could have just pressed ZR to mark them with melee anyway
[5:28:51] <%Monkeyweed21> Still worse than the diving stab from Iceborne
[5:28:53] <Zombrocom> Man they sure did IG dirty huh
[5:28:54] <+the___moustache> It's a real letdown after the buzzsaw.
[5:29:00] <UPTONOGOOD18> it look like the kinsect mark mechanic
[5:29:01] <%JoshManVGH> i wonder how that playes into the infinit combo
[5:29:01] <+Shubreaker> hit it w kinsect
[5:29:04] <Blank9> your kinsect will home in on the cloud
[5:29:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> there are still more switch moves though arent there?
[5:29:10] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt That's a kinsect mark
[5:29:12] <Blank9> yes
[5:29:12] <sonicblade38> @BlueSpartan119 central
[5:29:17] <Blank9> it's a bad switch skill
[5:29:24] <+xemnahort> According to Nintendo website rise unlocks in 2 hours and 30 minutes
[5:29:26] <+Grayhammatter> yeah... seems kinda lame
[5:29:26] <blackbookalpha> @PatStaresAt secret feature: Insect Glaive lets you wall-hang
[5:29:28] <+koroshi60> they revamped the incesct so differnt bugs act diffrently
[5:29:28] <DovaDude29> It marks for the kinsect
[5:29:38] <+koroshi60> i assume the starter bug wont do anything
[5:29:40] <DovaDude29> So you  don’t ya awe to aim
[5:29:40] <Blank9> it a spot is marked and the kinsect is out, the kinsect will autoattack that spot
[5:29:46] <%JoshManVGH> it was l2 and x i think
[5:29:56] <%JoshManVGH> sorry ZL
[5:30:00] <rReizs> time for GUN
[5:30:03] <Blank9> light bowgun's the shit
[5:30:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> If there are more switch skills theres still a chance
[5:30:06] <Zombrocom> Point and shoot
[5:30:07] <$StrawberryPantsu> JUST SHOOT STOOPID
[5:30:10] <DovaDude29> GUN GUN
[5:30:11] <%Monkeyweed21> IG LOST moves from Iceborne
[5:30:11] <Saltmeisterr> SHOOT
[5:30:11] <BlueSpartan119> @sonicblade38 so 3am
[5:30:13] <+Grayhammatter> time for GUN
[5:30:14] <DovaDude29> GANG GANG
[5:30:14] <Blank9> A lays mines that explode when they're hit
[5:30:34] <+yourfriendtusks> brrrap brrrap
[5:30:34] <%SaiyanShoto> Yeah I was very disappointed with IG since I was an ig main in World
[5:30:43] <DasFreekman> SMOrc DAKKA SMOrc
[5:30:56] <Blank9> you can lay the mines from your wirebug jump
[5:31:00] <+genepark> GIEF! Nice
[5:31:09] <Saltmeisterr> Haha goblins
[5:31:11] <AshmanFTW> I'm actually planning on using Light/Heavy BG in Rise
[5:31:11] <Blank9> and sticky the monster
[5:31:14] <thesubgenius912> gyro aim is so nice for the guns
[5:31:23] <%Monkeyweed21> Ammo is super cheap and easy to stock up on @PatStaresAt
[5:31:29] <yuber_> just give ig some time later in the game as you progress in game same with bow lol
[5:31:30] <%Dapper_Cactuar> mines are charges not ammo
[5:31:31] <Giztech> do the jump move and plant the darts in the monsters head
[5:31:40] <+D00msDayDan> @Monkeyweed21 yeah but what if i need it later
[5:31:47] <+Dragon4234> @PatStaresAt for balance
[5:31:53] <PleaseCallMeSugar> how easy is it to play a facefuck shotgun playstyle in Rise?
[5:31:53] <%YakumoYomi> Why do blademasters have to sharpen?
[5:32:00] <BlueSpartan119> only 3 and a half hours left now :)
[5:32:01] <Blank9> gens had a great idea with internal ammo, it was way better
[5:32:04] <blackbookalpha> Do that move and press A to drop a mine
[5:32:05] <%JumboCrunchies> Fire while you're vaulting
[5:32:14] <dan_g_v> you gotta shoot manually?
[5:32:15] <+yourfriendtusks> youre out of mines
[5:32:16] <$Afterman_> @Monkeyweed21 thats why you make 100000000 bullets
[5:32:19] <dan_g_v> on the big jump, I mean
[5:32:21] <%Monkeyweed21> hit a whhile vaulting
[5:32:28] <dan_g_v> big bonk
[5:32:28] <DovaDude29> Blast while ya vault over it
[5:32:29] <$Afterman_> oops meant to @D00msDayDan
[5:32:30] <+xemnahort> @bluespartan119 according to Nintendo website it’s 2 and a half hours
[5:32:35] <%YakumoYomi> @PleaseCallMeSugar If the demo is any indication, pretty easy. HBG has a counter Silkbind attack
[5:32:46] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> Does releasing charge attack midair with hammer still give you a little hop?
[5:32:52] <PleaseCallMeSugar> hell yeah
[5:32:58] <Zombrocom> Ah, strafe shot
[5:33:02] <DovaDude29> YOU DID IT WRONG

[5:33:42] <blackbookalpha> glowy arm buff
[5:33:49] <+Grayhammatter> dorifto
[5:33:52] <DovaDude29> PLEASE redo the wire bug vault
[5:33:59] <Giztech> wyvernblast while vaulting is the key to the light bowgun
[5:34:04] <DovaDude29> Do the wire but vault right
[5:34:06] <noirxgwen> thanks been trying to play with joy cons and hate the game
[5:34:14] <PleaseCallMeSugar> man I love the design for this one
[5:34:16] <Saltmeisterr> beeg gun
[5:34:19] <Blank9> HBG has charge shots now, hold fire before shooting
[5:34:20] <Devbob98> So is Pat done Hunting ?
[5:34:20] <%kyh9> this game looks so good
[5:34:20] <+Grayhammatter> DAKKA

[5:34:35] <%YakumoYomi> Hold the fire button to charge shots
[5:34:39] <blackbookalpha> that vault wyvernblast gets easier if you set camera turning speed to Very Fast
[5:34:42] <koffeemancer> you can charge normal shots now btw

[5:36:21] <blackbookalpha> succ the juice, squirt
[5:36:28] <%BestTeaMaker> fucking sniper
[5:36:31] <sonicblade38> @PatStaresAt note that the alt to the big snipe is a gatling gun so that would be a healing minigun
[5:36:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> make it step on you first
[5:36:39] <+Grayhammatter> that's wild
[5:36:48] <%Monkeyweed21> HEALING MINIGUN
[5:36:49] <Blank9> bow may as well be a melee weapon
[5:36:54] <DovaDude29> THE WIREBUGS PAT
[5:36:57] <Saltmeisterr> u missed the silkbinds pat
[5:37:02] <blackbookalpha> try melee attack with close-range coating, doesn't use coat
[5:37:14] <DovaDude29> SILKBINDS FOR HEAVY PAT
[5:37:16] <Blank9> A still does followup attacks of the same charge level
[5:37:26] <Saltmeisterr> for heavy bowgun
[5:37:29] <yuber_> its cuz its using the old shot types and their lvls
[5:37:32] <rReizs> close-range coating is infinite anyways
[5:37:33] <+xemnahort> Pat Fucked Up
[5:37:48] <Blank9> can do multiple power shots in a row to eat your stamina but do big damage
[5:38:08] <AshmanFTW> Does dodge charging still exist?
[5:38:12] <WeebFever> why does da bow make a bang sound
[5:38:20] <Blank9> You also get an attack boost by dodging while aiming
[5:38:25] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah
[5:38:30] <rasamune> Everything makes a bang sound in Monster Hunter
[5:38:31] <AshmanFTW> Nice
[5:38:39] <%Ixiah> wirebugs
[5:38:39] <OneThousandTomatoes> silkbind
[5:38:51] <%solracc25> bug
[5:38:58] <blackbookalpha> that silkbind replenishes stamina quicker
[5:38:58] <Caivyre> bow LUL
[5:38:59] <OneThousandTomatoes> thats the one that recharges your stamina while squating
[5:39:13] <amonimis> !uptime
[5:39:13] <%Broand> Handheld mode eats battery but maintains the framerate
[5:39:13] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 39m.
[5:39:14] <koffeemancer> you recharge stamina quicker
[5:39:18] <DovaDude29> Coating
[5:39:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> drain your stamina then do it
[5:39:29] <$D4C_Trice> that the stamina reduction ability?
[5:39:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> and buffs
[5:39:57] <+seaearthandsky> its just a "fuck this shit I'm out" limesLUL
[5:40:01] <blackbookalpha> Herculean Draw + Melee + Close Range Coat = OP
[5:40:10] <$Fairy_princess77> Fairy_princess77 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 36 months! 
[5:40:16] <OneThousandTomatoes> thats an attack buff on yout arm
[5:40:35] <+Grayhammatter> oh?
[5:40:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> interesting
[5:40:38] <sonicblade38> so now the bow turn u into baynetta?
[5:40:42] <Blank9> It's a counter
[5:40:44] <rasamune> Graze mode?
[5:40:44] <Blank9> like adept
[5:40:47] <%TamsynRRD> Pat gives off big Arin energy when trying out the gunner weapons.
[5:40:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> counter
[5:40:59] <+yourfriendtusks> witch time
[5:41:02] <+rottingpastry> Look at that Kappa
[5:41:05] <%TheWinged7> too early
[5:41:12] <ECRead> What did the heavy bowgun's wirebugs do?
[5:41:16] <PleaseCallMeSugar> LUL
[5:41:24] <%JumboCrunchies> The timing window might be a little tight
[5:41:25] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:41:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> pat
[5:41:41] <+yourfriendtusks> you keep dodging into it i think?
[5:41:42] <+seaearthandsky> god is it royal guard timing or something?
[5:42:07] <theanora1> Sweet the Play at Home games are finally on the PSN!
[5:42:07] <OneThousandTomatoes> can you look at the description again?
[5:42:09] <Blank9> weird, blue flashes usually mean guard points
[5:42:11] <ChungusQuest> negative i-frames LUL
[5:42:12] <%JumboCrunchies> So no i-frames, just an active dodge?
[5:42:16] <Caivyre> It's Dodgebolt, not Parrybolt
[5:42:31] <OneThousandTomatoes> ooooh
[5:42:37] <+seaearthandsky> no i frames just get out the way then?
[5:42:38] <%TheWinged7> royal guard with quick charge
[5:42:43] <+TheIntellectional> you probably need to iframe through the attack but also be out of it by the time the dodge ends
[5:42:52] <+TheIntellectional> so start at the edge of it
[5:42:59] <Blank9> it makes the dodge do damage
[5:43:07] <Blank9> only 17 though
[5:43:09] <blackbookalpha> hit plant get heals
[5:43:14] <%sumrand0> YO FUCK THIS RELEASE SCHEDULE BULLSHIT ITS 1AM LET ME IN. LET ME INNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN

[5:44:02] <+theballad_tft> meanwhile waiting for pc port feels like MHW all over again sadge
[5:44:21] <+D00msDayDan> @theballad_tft can't wait to wait an extra year for bugfixes
[5:44:21] <EynosStyles> @onethousandtomatoes you have my condolence
[5:44:21] <PleaseCallMeSugar> god I feel you
[5:44:23] <%sumrand0> ppl waiting for PC releases aren't real ppl tho so.....fuck em?

[5:44:39] <%sumrand0> lol
[5:44:39] <Saltmeisterr> cool
[5:44:42] <%sumrand0> jk
[5:44:45] <blackbookalpha> You can just let go. Holding the button lets you aim
[5:44:47] <Giztech> aiming and not shooting also does a auto block
[5:44:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> D:
[5:44:51] <%WhereIsWill> a counter AND a GTFO
[5:44:52] <+Grayhammatter> what the hell was that?
[5:45:07] <Blank9> yeah no need to hold it long
[5:45:15] <blackbookalpha> @PatStaresAt No damage boost when you charge it. Holding the button lets you aim before firing the shot
[5:45:16] <AshmanFTW> If you have a shield attachment on your HBG though
[5:45:26] <DudeDern> God the one liners are the best
[5:45:40] <EynosStyles> I can't wait for the armour that turns you into gundam
[5:45:59] <%sumrand0> considering the release schedule for PC i should be at least about HR 500 by then unless Master Rank/G rank gets added sooner
[5:46:00] <Blank9> I feel like they may have gotten rid of shield attachment on hbg
[5:46:08] <Blank9> they got rid of siege mode for sure
[5:46:08] <$D4C_Trice> how does one use the light bowgun silkbind attack work?
[5:46:11] <EynosStyles> @ashmanftw don't need it as long as you stand still you get a natural guard
[5:46:18] <OneThousandTomatoes> time to kill a KappaHD
[5:46:31] <BlueSpartan119> Wirebug move, minor move, major move

[5:47:08] <inpaladin> some of the tweak moves change entire combos
[5:47:14] <%YakumoYomi> I wonder why Tetsucabra didn't make the cut. Seems like its aesthetic (sumo frog) would fit right in
[5:47:20] <blackbookalpha> @D4C_Trice Fanning Vault lets you drop mines from the air. Other one is a charged shot using free slicing ammo
[5:47:20] <EynosStyles> @d4c_trice if you see an opening slide forward use big attack. see attack coming quick dodge out of the way. that's it

[5:54:55] <BlueSpartan119> @lets_be_friendos seems like it but that could be because wirebugs

[5:55:02] <blackbookalpha> healing plant next to Pat

[5:55:39] <%solracc25> sumo
[5:55:41] <%YakumoYomi> @Pnutz409 DLC is just cosmetic stuff, so it's only worth it if you like how they look
[5:55:43] <+xemnahort> Man sfv gave E Honda some real love
[5:55:43] <blackbookalpha> @PatStaresAt use Elmo's healing plant
[5:55:47] <Mattais88> REPUKEN

[5:55:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> @Pnutz409 modesly aesthetic stuff with maybe a very minor buff item
[5:55:51] <+NickNackProductions> man the game looks real solid for a switch game
[5:55:54] <Link232> I just notice wirebugs recharge independent of one another, that's pretty neat
[5:55:59] <+Shubreaker> this is like late-game monster patterns holy shit

[5:56:30] <blackbookalpha> Khezu arena

[6:00:02] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt this gonna be your GOTY 2021?
[6:00:07] <Aydarkzero> would be nice but it will prob only be switch and pc
[6:00:14] <EynosStyles> they confirmed on they're Twitter
[6:00:17] <lets_be_friendos> too much money to keep it just on switch and pc
[6:00:20] <DublinRage> Are there stll Arena quests? And are they unlocked by cappin mosters?
[6:00:22] <%saltenergy> Bring Back Big Zam
[6:00:25] <+identitydisc> @patstaresat which is better great sword or switch axe?
[6:00:25] <GrandMazterNelson> is it just me or do you hear Barret in the background ? is that pat's character?
[6:00:26] <+campasino> MHW was so much better on PC
[6:00:27] <%YakumoYomi> @czeekytv Because Switch is dominating in Japan
[6:00:27] <%Ranryu692> that's not a new game, though; that's an update
[6:00:38] <DublinRage> *capping monsters
[6:00:41] <%ThirdWelles> Official statement is "early 2022"

[6:00:52] <Aydarkzero> the armor has been looking solid
[6:00:54] <%Ghufufin> teenage mutant ninja hunter
[6:00:55] <+yourfriendtusks> master chief
[6:00:55] <%PettyFunk> Nier is coming out soon too, but that’s not really a new game
[6:00:56] <blackbookalpha> Jin-Roh armor
[6:00:56] <Pnutz409> cybernator!
[6:00:57] <%solracc25> DOOM GUY
[6:01:00] <nuane> doom guy set
[6:01:04] <%ThirdWelles> "Alternate Duran Duran armor"
[6:01:05] <Mattais88> Space Marine
[6:01:12] <ChungusQuest> looks kinda like a Zaku
[6:01:20] <$D4C_Trice> wait the armour has faster gunshots?!?
[6:01:21] <DublinRage> Reminds me a bit of Jin-Ro
[6:01:21] <battlexqueen> Loooks like s xenogear mech
[6:01:22] <%PettyFunk> Looks like a Zaku
[6:01:27] <+Sir_Dolphinian> i have a decent PC but the past month of playing ps5 on a new 4k tv makes we want EVERYTHING on console now
[6:01:28] <%YakumoYomi> Yo...I'm glad someone else remember Cybernator. That game was rad.
[6:01:29] <%Ynkubus_> Its a swamp footballer
[6:01:30] <%PettyFunk> Oh hive mind @chungusquest
[6:01:33] <+Snektor> I would get this game, but not a fan of the bug system (wire bug I think). Probably just stick to World and Generations for now
[6:01:35] <+QuesoFM> wow not gonna unlock till 4am rough
[6:01:37] <+campasino> This main song is a little much
[6:01:39] <PleaseCallMeSugar> that's some early blast
[6:01:46] <%ThirdWelles> the duck is, indeed, a water boy
[6:01:48] <blackbookalpha> Buster Sword ha
[6:01:49] <BlueSpartan119> Aknosom
[6:01:50] <Devbob98> The main song is vibes
[6:01:54] <ChungusQuest> @PettyFunk we are the smarted ones
[6:01:57] <%Monkeyweed21> DOG TURTLE
[6:01:59] <$D4C_Trice> the spooder
[6:02:01] <inpaladin> rathalos has a greatsword so yeah
[6:02:02] <peyodogo> main song is great
[6:02:03] <+Grayhammatter> cool
[6:02:06] <%BestTeaMaker> that's a goddamn great looking sword
[6:02:07] <%solracc25> dmn
[6:02:15] <+xemnahort> Why does everyone say it’s coming out at 4 the timer from Nintendo ends in 2 hours
[6:02:15] <%PettyFunk> This sounds like it would play at the climax of an anime’s first season LUL
[6:02:19] <OneThousandTomatoes> dog and cat armor?
[6:02:21] <Devbob98> That sword is stupid sick
[6:02:28] <sonicblade38> its as if giveing more weapon modles was a good idea
[6:02:29] <+Grayhammatter> palico and dog armor?
[6:02:34] <%sumrand0> PC fans we get your thirst but console fans aren't concerned with performance differences (as long its functional) .....at least I'm not. I prefer hunting with 100% legit save files
[6:02:36] <+Nautilus_Bot> That fire GS looks like Roys sword from FE
[6:02:38] <+QuesoFM> the timer im looking at say 3 hours
[6:02:42] <%Monkeyweed21> they have more than 1 guy making weapon models
[6:02:48] <$Falilth> Ok, but where's the USJ missions i already miss them
[6:02:50] <DublinRage> I hope the Rathalos Hammer comes back
[6:03:00] <%Monkeyweed21> why here
[6:03:11] <%VashyronM> is it running well?
[6:03:25] <Saltmeisterr> @sumrand0 what are u talking bout man
[6:03:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> runs great
[6:03:28] <%JoshManVGH> man weapons aren't 1 of 2 models with paint. that's awesome
[6:03:31] <Devbob98> @vashyronm Haven’t seen any serious issues
[6:03:35] <%SWFanatic> Is Pat cosplaying as Pyramid Head?
[6:03:35] <%sumrand0> USJ will probably be gone by the time NA gets the game.......jk obviously
[6:03:38] <+DragonsVanguard> how does the game feel undocked have you tried it?
[6:03:53] <inpaladin> the damage come out way earlier
[6:04:15] <inpaladin> you still get the damage on the shield charge but it's at the end of the animaiton
[6:04:17] <$D4C_Trice> the guard hits too
[6:04:17] <%Monkeyweed21> guard tackle has more startup
[6:04:22] <%JoshManVGH> guard seems better
[6:04:29] <%sumrand0> Switch lite user: pray for me to get decent framerates that's all I want......
[6:04:31] <%Monkeyweed21> regular tackle is instant startup
[6:04:36] <BlueSpartan119> can you roll into guard tackle?
[6:04:42] <BlueSpartan119> w/ weapon unsheathed
[6:04:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> did he look at the cat and dog tertonadon armor?
[6:04:49] <+Nautilus_Bot> Seems like tackle is better if you wanna set up a TCS
[6:04:54] <koffeemancer> Guard tackle also eats up a lot of stamina if you take a hit it seems
[6:04:57] <+xemnahort> If I actually used gs I’d use the guard tackle but I don’t so I won’t
[6:05:22] <+xemnahort> @koffeemancer that’s probably because he doesn’t have guard skills
[6:05:23] <DublinRage> The text "True Charged Slash (Power)" implies there are variants :O
[6:05:25] <%ThirdWelles> It closes a little bit of distance too
[6:05:27] <%JoshManVGH> but the guard point takes effect once the sword is up right? not just the forward motion?
[6:05:40] <$D4C_Trice> I'm going to have to use gs
[6:05:41] <AshmanFTW> I wonder if it cuts into more sharpness too if you guard tackle
[6:05:43] <koffeemancer> Yeah probably
[6:05:49] <$SGrim> That's for knockdowns
[6:05:53] <%MadPretty> GS is life
[6:06:02] <+Grayhammatter> it probably does
[6:06:08] <EynosStyles> tackle is counter attack. guard tackle is counter guard
[6:06:09] <inpaladin> it has a TON of Iframes
[6:06:11] <sonicblade38> @AshmanFTW its a guard so sharp go down

[6:09:57] <+max_radical> does rise have a lot of the quality of life changes from world or is it still archaic for monhun boomers?
[6:09:59] <%SirGO0SE> more like fartnight
[6:10:00] <%solracc25> Fortnit died?
[6:10:04] <+CarissMcbober> I just don't watch if it's a game I'm gonna play myself. Like, I'll totally go back and watch your RE8 playthrough on youtube, but probably not live assuming you get early access.
[6:10:10] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> competitive fortniters are mad
[6:10:10] <%SaiyanShoto> I still have no clue and I was looking at the hashtag earlier LUL
[6:10:11] <timdtoolmantaylor> ktkPRO ktkPRO ktkPRO ktkPRO ktkPRO
[6:10:11] <%YakumoYomi> To be fair, FF7 Remake was sent out early intentionally to offset COVID delays

[6:12:02] <%ABakedDemon> Well pat I'm glad I was able to catch you after work goodnight my awesome big angry ginger man
[6:12:03] <%czeekytv> CoM is the worst game with the most plot setup ever
[6:12:04] <%solracc25> watch boss videos
[6:12:05] <%SaiyanShoto> I enjoyed it, it felt better on gameboy though
[6:12:06] <frostyjay3> Chain of Memories is garbage
[6:12:12] <blackbookalpha> That was the only KH game I played since someone at Disney just left it at the lunch table
[6:12:14] <dan_g_v> Max just finished making his character :3
[6:12:17] <%Ranryu692> it was bad, but the worst part was that it would require you to sacrifice cards to open doors
[6:12:19] <%sumrand0> ok good someone good is playing lolol
[6:12:21] <+Grayhammatter> yep

[6:12:35] <%MadPretty> @blackbookalpha you fell into their trap
[6:12:35] <%SaiyanShoto> CoM is definitely my least favorite KH though
[6:12:45] <%sumrand0> I'm not your buddy Pal!
[6:12:49] <+Grayhammatter> i was gonna be hyped, but i ain't gonna play at fricking 3am

[6:12:52] <$D4C_Trice> Buddy Buddy upper
[6:12:53] <$Falilth> @PatStaresAt  looks like the fortenite is because epic said to not gamble on matches anymore
[6:13:04] <EynosStyles> Aren't the buddies just automatic farming
[6:13:21] <Devbob98> Isn’t that kicking your own ass then
[6:13:28] <DublinRage> WtH is with Square and ruining series with time travel?
[6:13:35] <blackbookalpha> CoM felt like a test product to build TWEWY

[6:15:22] <%justcallmebobplease> Pat being real
[6:15:25] <%sumrand0> it is
[6:15:27] <frostyjay3> @EynosStyles Nah just some of the games suck
[6:15:29] <%justcallmebobplease> He's right tho
[6:15:31] <+koroshi60> you dont like underwater combat
[6:15:32] <%AzureGale> Tri blows
[6:15:34] <%MadPretty> MH1 is fucking awful. I remember me and a buddy busting our ass trying to play that bullshit
[6:15:35] <%AzureGale> Tri is awful
[6:15:40] <+Gespens> tri did have lagiacrus though
[6:15:41] <blackbookalpha> Was this the crab claw game?
[6:15:43] <%AzureGale> Tri is not good
[6:15:50] <ytwitchmeng> You cant say tri was bad if you didnt ....TRY...
[6:15:57] <karovus> mh1 makes me wonder how the series is still here
[6:15:57] <DublinRage> I'd rather see Pat stream and talk about Xenogears. I loved his Chrono Trigger LP
[6:16:00] <+Grayhammatter> underwater fights were trash
[6:16:07] <%czeekytv> How does World stack up in the series?
[6:16:14] <$KnivesEve> the less monsters and underwater i agree tho
[6:16:16] <Mattais88> New Gen to Third Stirke?
[6:16:19] <+Gespens> I hope you're not a gunlance, dual blades, or bow fan
[6:16:20] <rasamune> Tri was my first Monster Hunter and I liked it :>
[6:16:21] <%Aeoneth> Low Monsters count, underwater combat
[6:16:25] <rasamune> Doubt I could go back to it though
[6:16:27] <Devbob98> Where’s rise at in your mh rankings?
[6:16:29] <EynosStyles> @grayhammatter Arekkz say he miss the underwater lol
[6:16:30] <%sumrand0> ppl who say tri is good is PROOF some people have TERRIBLE opinions that can't be trusted
[6:17:15] <%Mrbaconator> swimming is trash
[6:17:22] <DublinRage> Are we getting Lagiacris in Rise?
[6:17:25] <+koroshi60> i like quropecco flint wings
[6:17:28] <%BubbaRands> fuck swimming
[6:17:31] <+Grayhammatter> ceadeus... yikes
[6:17:33] <+Gespens> Cedeus is still, somehow not the worst Elder Dragon in the franchise
[6:17:35] <%YakumoYomi> Hard disagree. Lagi, Gobul, and Royal Ludroth are boring on land.
[6:17:36] <$thomassolorio> yo pat I see you rocking the wedding ring it suits you keep those skanks from fondling your yumyums cupcakes I see
[6:17:40] <%Aeoneth> Ceadus had a RAD fucking design though
[6:17:42] <%Mrbaconator> bring jhen moran back!
[6:17:44] <blackbookalpha> silkbind feels like a problem solver for underwater combat
[6:17:45] <EynosStyles> @dublinrage signs point to yes, but eh?
[6:17:48] <%sumrand0> U want sum Blu
[6:17:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> Ceadeus is the slowest most annoying shit
[6:17:50] <rasamune> Ceadeus' theme is really good, at least
[6:18:01] <%sumrand0> Becky used to like my tail....
[6:18:20] <%MadPretty> WOOF
[6:18:34] <%sumrand0> that's trash and so are tri fans
[6:18:44] <%BubbaRands> Ceadeus is one of the best looking monsters...I never want to see again
[6:18:50] <EynosStyles> they put a cap on High rank.
[6:18:56] <BoomerSqueaker> HE DID THE THING PogChamp
[6:18:58] <%GeneralSCPatton> Imagine not even having the hardware for multiplayer

[6:19:15] <%Mrbaconator> EAT FOOD PAT
[6:19:29] <%JoshManVGH> RIP Fortnite: looks like people also hate a crafing system that was introduced. Competitive players are pissed about balance or something, and the gambling thing.

[6:19:36] <+Grayhammatter> yeah, big bad choices
