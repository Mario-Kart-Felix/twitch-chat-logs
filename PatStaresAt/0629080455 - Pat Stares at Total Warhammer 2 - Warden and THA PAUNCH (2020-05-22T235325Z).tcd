[0:13:32] <Monkeyweed21> Peasants DONT MATTER
[0:13:33] <%TrafficCohen> @PatStaresAt If you don't like units being disposable, play Dwarfs
[0:13:33] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt They are orcs and goblins. They don't matter.

[0:13:40] <BliVru> You should play skaven then!
[0:13:41] <%Binary_Fireball> then make more

[0:13:51] <countgaculatv> If they're dead, then they weren't good
[0:13:51] <Esparsenior> Playing on a lower difficulty is really helpful. It makes the AI way less aggressive which makes the game perfect for new players
[0:13:51] <%TaterBurglar> Try real hard to make the less experienced ones die first
[0:13:51] <@mothmandraws> they gobbos
[0:13:52] <%madskull456> but theyre not there expendable lol

[0:17:52] <%maenos2> tabletop? that shit is expensive.
[0:17:52] <SGrim> Because Games Workshop has the market cornered.
[0:17:52] <%QuadraticGravity> @voremommy69 momoooo
[0:17:53] <+oda_flobunaga> Because PUBLISHERS SUX
[0:17:53] <Zombrocom> There should be a big sale soon TBH wait for that

[0:18:06] <bolero765> buy on sale for the love of god

[0:18:07] <%thelonechris> Goddamn you Games Workshop
[0:18:09] <@mothmandraws> because they put out dlc every 3-4 months for $10
[0:18:10] <%ssjklyco> It's mimicking warhammer
[0:18:10] <SGrim> About the cost of a starter 2000 point army for tabletop
[0:18:10] <%legendscar01> Child's play haha
[0:18:10] <kazadog> train simulator OP

[0:18:22] <%marsantas> Compared to crusader kings it's baby mode
[0:18:23] <%Binary_Fireball> $300 tabletop is one medium army
[0:18:27] <%Binary_Fireball> without paint
[0:18:29] <+failingyeti> Its not expensive if you buy it as it comes out like a huge nerd
[0:18:33] <%Alazull> Enough for a 1500 point army
[0:18:35] <gunnzier> hello to everyone from Russia

[0:28:50] <$ItsRatman> cheer500 Hey Pat. On the most recent podcast you guys briefly mentioned how spears were the dominant weapon in warfare and swords are garbo.

[0:30:53] <+rowboat_girlyman> slomo is the best way to do battles
[0:30:54] <+ishouldfeelbad> Meatshields for the grinder
[0:30:54] <Zombrocom> @MisterRockett Yeah, blood bowl is a tabletop game

[0:32:11] <%MaddyCaddy> Swords beat spears one on one though
[0:32:12] <dinnydanny777> Bows were the best weapon in warfare
[0:32:14] <@mothmandraws> oh btw pat
[0:32:14] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt Considering any other Total War like games?
[0:32:15] <Lazyturd> spearmen are important
[0:32:15] <+failingyeti> I WANT SHOGUN 3
[0:32:16] <dinnydanny777> Bows were the best
[0:32:16] <zamzoph> Horses HATE them!
[0:32:17] <%marsantas> You gotta have that distance
[0:32:18] <%crimsonharvest> any creature with two hands can use a spear you better watch out
[0:32:18] <@mothmandraws> gobbos spears dont have anti large
[0:32:19] <%king_wragles> Ya, they're the best answer to calvary
[0:32:19] <%spiritofmojave> spears = STYLE POWER
[0:32:19] <+rowboat_girlyman> spears wreck cavalry
[0:32:20] <Ell1ot> big pointy sticks
[0:32:20] <%MonsterEnvy> Spears were super imortant.
[0:32:20] <@mothmandraws> they too puny
[0:32:20] <%Pappajimbo> just like real lfe
[0:32:21] <derap41> Spear is the best weapon in history
[0:32:23] <+rowboat_girlyman> and anything big
[0:32:23] <OvaltineDream> even better is long yari ashigaru
[0:32:24] <Zombrocom> Spear infantry are the core of any army
[0:32:24] <KyroDragon> gotta have the yari ashigaru
[0:32:24] <+Ace5335> good thing orcs dont have them
[0:32:26] <+Remery_> Bows are bullshit, fuck archers, cowards
[0:32:27] <%MaddyCaddy> You need a formation of spear dudes to be good
[0:32:29] <Robot_Nixon_> The long pokey stick meta
[0:32:30] <+oda_flobunaga> Fall of the Samurai is the SHIT
[0:32:31] <%SpcOpsBear> You heard of spears, and you've heard of axes
[0:32:32] <%thegreenbenis> Horses don't like stabby.
[0:32:33] <dinnydanny777> Bows were the best, Samurai literally used to use bows
[0:32:35] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Swords don't mean shit if you can't get close
[0:32:35] <%SpcOpsBear> Now get ready for FUCKING HALBERDS
[0:32:35] <BallerSwagBro9k> Thats why DS Spear builds are the most OP
[0:32:35] <%miguelrod777> occasional
[0:32:36] <%Kataguro> You can get bonuses that make gobbo spearman Anti-large though
[0:32:36] <Mister_McDerp> archers > everything else

[0:32:37] <+TitaniumDragoonNeo> Horses suck actual ass IRL
[0:32:37] <%MonsterEnvy> Spears were really important in the real world.
[0:32:39] <+Skwizgarr> big fuck off monsters
[0:32:41] <+ishouldfeelbad> ??? just have mammoth or dino stacks
[0:32:42] <derap41> Bonus vs large is king
[0:32:43] <PROUD2beGINGER> But does the stick beat the rope?
[0:32:44] <%WhereIsWill> spear all time best weapon in history
[0:32:45] <+MidnightBurst12> Spears > Other melee weapons
[0:32:45] <RetributionP> miwitawe woola of oool Japan
[0:32:45] <+xeros720> bows are just long range spears
[0:32:48] <%Alazull> The Warhamlet
[0:32:48] <%ArcanumMBD> or a larger rat homunculus
[0:32:48] <derekwst3> so pokemon?
[0:32:49] <Lazyturd> tercios kinda reckt the spearwall
[0:32:49] <%crimsonharvest> or a lava spider
[0:32:50] <Heyestus> BIG GATOR BOIS
[0:32:50] <+shinichizio> Occasional
[0:32:51] <%Kataguro> Or a box that shoots screaming skulls
[0:32:52] <+eossg1> spear > rocks
[0:32:53] <%ArcanumMBD> or an even larger rat homunculus
[0:32:54] <+CatastropheCorvid> Nah, Pat, Spearmen are some of the most effective bronze age infantrymen.
[0:32:55] <+oda_flobunaga> Ironclad Sea battles are the BEEZ KNEEZ
[0:32:56] <+Skwizgarr> or a giant undead hermit crab
[0:32:59] <dinnydanny777> Javelin were good too
[0:32:59] <CrimsonFox777> The Hell-Pit Abomination monkaS
[0:33:01] <RevolverBobkat> or an undead ship monster

[0:33:02] <+PleasantLee> Hey Pat, if you could have any arcade cabinet, what would you get?
[0:33:03] <Dfreddy8> Depends how long the stick is.
[0:33:03] <rafaelba93> irl spears and polearms were the
[0:33:03] <kazadog> or a big stone kitty
[0:33:03] <%Aztec50> or a big fuck off daemon
[0:33:04] <Zombrocom> Groms gobbos get nuts when you give them a bunch of buffs. 75 armour, regeneration, anti large
[0:33:05] <%SpcOpsBear> The spear is the best weapon. All of the other good weapons are just spears with extra shit on them.
[0:33:11] <Lazyturd> or some spellcaster
[0:33:12] <+SinisterBroccoli> is a rat homunculus just a bunch of rats?
[0:33:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> Dude imagine if you rode a dragon and wielded an AK. Shit would be OP
[0:33:17] <Esparsenior> Doomstack army > Missile Units > Spear Units > Everything Else
[0:33:22] <yourliteraldog> You will never be milked to death by darkelder wych
[0:33:23] <%Pappajimbo> thats why savage orks made the BIG STABBA
[0:33:32] <%crimsonharvest> magnifying lens

[0:33:33] <%thebetterbard> Focus?
[0:33:35] <%Kataguro> Using Grom makes me super overconfident when it comes to using goblins in other armies. I keep forgetting they're normally shit
[0:33:35] <lilredmage> rosaries are divine lightning rods GOT IT
[0:33:36] <rafaelba93> swords are just sidearms
[0:33:39] <Thewoodentree> @SinisterBroccoli Nope, just a big Hulk Rat
[0:33:39] <VigilantShield> a focus
[0:33:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> There's a reason spears got used so much until guns got *really* good

[0:45:55] <%nikoloas_> KNIFE-EARED PIECES OF SHIT
[0:45:56] <%SpcOpsBear> Warpstone is not uranium. It's just concentrated Chaos energy that has crystallized into a physical form. But yeah, I guess it's radioactive like uranium.

[0:46:06] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Given what we know about stereotypical Dwarves. Dwarves would either be the first race to go to space or they'd NEVER go to space, or even airplanes
[0:46:09] <lilredmage> Magical Racism
[0:46:09] <%king_wragles> That's really annoying, but not worth a riot imo
[0:46:10] <@mothmandraws> and the goblin doom diver can be steared midflight

[0:54:57] <Zombrocom> Running is fine

[0:54:57] <%WhereIsWill> music is pretty hype tho
[0:54:58] <%Piemono> It's fine for now
[0:54:58] <derap41> Guys its fine
[0:54:58] <+xXjuffelXx> Can you pause and order in this game?
[0:54:58] <%VashyronM> You can have them walk
[0:54:58] <Mister_McDerp> runnings okay in this game
[0:54:59] <%Binary_Fireball> @PatStaresAt default is run
[0:55:00] <huskarl_zap> Runnings not a big deal
[0:55:01] <+Remery_> Naked ratties
[0:55:01] <%marsantas> They auto run now
[0:55:02] <mattynezz> Double clicking runs, single click walks
[0:55:03] <%GabeSweetMan> psa1guy
[0:55:03] <+eggstyr0ne> dont worry about running
[0:55:05] <RevolverBobkat> you should turn off auto run
[0:55:06] <%legendscar01> Running is fine
[0:55:07] <HazaTheRaider> the invincible horde forms yes-yes!
[0:55:07] <Charronia> "You fight for me now" rooH
[0:55:07] <+Solutha> Running is fine
[0:55:07] <bolero765> @zamzoph doesn't really matter in tw warhammer, does is historical tw
[0:55:08] <@SoFarFetched> It's also just tutorial LUL
[0:55:09] <derap41> Running is fine 90% of the time
[0:55:10] <+Skyebaker> running wont matter in tutorial
[0:55:11] <@mothmandraws> running doesnt matter guys hes not on legendary
[0:55:11] <yourliteraldog> Do the skaven have a slavery thing or is that another faction in this game
[0:55:13] <+Skyebaker> stop bitching
[0:55:13] <%MisterRockett> They might re-group somewhere else on the map and regain health tho.
[0:55:14] <Bek_359> @gutlesscoward Skaven call all non-Skaven "things"
[0:55:14] <$ItsRatman> Run is on by default, but it's fine
[0:55:17] <%MaddyCaddy> Control draging makes them walk
[0:55:17] <%starotter70> It begins!
[0:55:20] <%Valdorick> Press R to make them walk (or issue the command while holding CTRL)... (But also IT DOESN'T FUCKING MATTER FOR THIS FIGHT)
[0:55:22] <CrimsonFox777> HE'S LEARNING
[0:55:22] <%Kataguro> He's learnding
[0:55:24] <%thebonebard> running doesnt cause exhaustion in this game
[0:55:24] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt running is okay
[0:55:24] <%Manwad> What does running do that's so negative?
[0:55:28] <Mister_McDerp> jermaOneguy trying to backseat movement speed
[0:55:32] <+Skyebaker> drain there stamina manwad
[0:55:33] <+ishouldfeelbad> I always run. especially with expendables
[0:55:35] <+oda_flobunaga> Control click and set them to a number key
[0:55:36] <+Skyebaker> its fine
[0:55:37] <@mothmandraws> they have energy meter
[0:55:38] <+rowboat_girlyman> put the slings in front then have them retreat
[0:55:38] <+ishouldfeelbad> or hit r
[0:55:39] <Drigoooooo> it takes a long time for them to get tired from running it's fine
[0:55:40] <jackeroff3> most tw games, running can exhaust your troops and make them slower in combat
[0:55:42] <@mothmandraws> get tired eventually
[0:55:45] <rafaelba93> backseat will be strong with this one
[0:55:46] <%BoomerUnchained> It's fine for now
[0:55:46] <mattynezz> Running makes them tired, tired units suck more
[0:55:48] <%maskedriderhero> hit the elves with rocks
[0:55:50] <Thewoodentree> @Manwad In the older games it made them tired
[0:55:52] <%Dementedpenguin> Look at this glorious rat party
[0:55:53] <%greyknight1575> running DOES cause exhaustion in this game, but it doesn't matter in these tutorial battles
[0:55:55] <derap41> @oda_flobunaga Maybe stay out of the deep end for at least a few minutes
[0:55:56] <%ssjklyco> Is Chat the tutorial or the game the tutorial?
[0:55:57] <Arisato_II> Pat Tsu, master of warfare
[0:55:58] <Bek_359> @yourliteraldog Skaven are far more likely to eat you than to enslave you. They have other Skaven for slave labor.
[0:56:00] <%SirGO0SE> haha rats go
[0:56:00] <huskarl_zap> Use alt lmb to move them whilst staying in formation
[0:56:00] <lilredmage> The rats rallying cry is sick
[0:56:00] <%arcaderabbit48> Screw orcs, just play rats
[0:56:01] <ha2ken> The rats will sling their excrement at the elf things
[0:56:03] <RetroCop87> The angry Warhammer backseaters START
[0:56:03] <%thebonebard> @mattynezz running doesnt do that in this game
[0:56:04] <dinnydanny777> Pebble > Elf Thingies
[0:56:06] <%Mr_Pylon> Does this game have unit formations like the other total wars?
[0:56:09] <%Punchasaur> stop playing not my way BabyRage
[0:56:10] <%BoomerUnchained> rocks PogChamp
[0:56:11] <KingVantq> tdogRock tdogRock tdogRock tdogRock
[0:56:12] <coracor> that's what they sling, pat
[0:56:13] <%spiritofmojave> There's gonna be a lot of yelling at the way Pat control rat
[0:56:13] <VigilantShield> see that fast forward button by default your guys run just means they get tired faster and that's it
[0:56:15] <zamzoph> rocks can kill you!
[0:56:16] <BallerSwagBro9k> ROCC
[0:56:17] <RetributionP> wait running will matter later then?
[0:56:17] <KingVantq> tdogRock tdogRock
[0:56:18] <%maskedriderhero> rat rocks
[0:56:19] <Firststrike_OW> let him play the game guys
[0:56:20] <dinnydanny777> Rocks > Elf Thingies
[0:56:22] <+ishouldfeelbad> if you really want to, press r to change if a unit is walking or running
[0:56:22] <+Skyebaker> yes
[0:56:23] <derap41> Ah yes Skaven technology a rock and a thong
[0:56:23] <%MaddyCaddy> @Mr_Pylon Only like Bretonian Cav
[0:56:23] <%legendscar01> PAT big PP
[0:56:24] <%Kataguro> The Advisor really is a simp
[0:56:24] <KingVantq> tdogRat
[0:56:24] <%TimetodiveLTX> that fixed z axis movement is pretty smart
[0:56:26] <lloyddboy> THROW ROCK-STONE, YES YES
[0:56:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Even the Skaven know the value of Boulder Heave
[0:56:27] <lilredmage> ITS OVER HIGH ELVES, I HAVE THE RIDGE
[0:56:27] <+Skyebaker> running will matter later
[0:56:28] <zamzoph> HOOOOOLD
[0:56:28] <mattynezz> @thebonebard Really? Jesus, I spent a LOT of time walking for no reason then
[0:56:30] <+xmetalicdemonx> Get super tempted.
[0:56:30] <+UberWolfman> DS LP all over again LUL
[0:56:33] <%Valdorick> Who would win? A trained archer with a bow crafted from a blessed wood harvested by a treant; or some rat with a rock?
[0:56:36] <KingVantq> tdogRat tdogRock tdogRat
[0:56:36] <RetributionP> well tell pat now it's fine
[0:56:37] <%queaks> @PatStaresAt The order of your units on the bottom bar is the order they are right-click dragged into place
[0:56:39] <+Excelumin> ridged for rat pleasure
[0:56:42] <derap41> Its the resolution scale that fucks it
[0:56:42] <%Mr_Pylon> @MaddyCaddy ah, thanks
[0:56:44] <yourliteraldog> @Bek_359 right right
[0:56:52] <Charronia> Just keep camping until the enemy moves esaGood
[0:56:56] <+oda_flobunaga> actually what you want to do is set the individual behavior of the different units... some ranged guys should be on skirmish mode some should be on stand ground etc. Kappa
[0:56:58] <lilredmage> @Valdorick one ratty boi
[0:57:04] <dinnydanny777> Are the elves even moving?
[0:57:05] <Reanimator83> Take a shot every time they say my lord
[0:57:08] <+pistachio_the_nut> Why are the health and stuff blinking? Doesn't happen in my game
[0:57:10] <lloyddboy> NEITHER DID I
[0:57:12] <@mothmandraws> ye I do spears on side and 1 spear in middle
[0:57:12] <+LtSquid> I have 200+ hours in this game and i didnt know you could do that
[0:57:12] <+oda_flobunaga> that was a joke
[0:57:12] <%l3sovikk> psaDab_BW
[0:57:14] <%Binary_Fireball> spread the front line a bit more
[0:57:15] <%MaddyCaddy> If you shift click mutliple units you can press G to group them
[0:57:16] <Personified134> @PatStaresAt The most important function that the game isn't bothering to explain is the fact that you can group multiple units to single hotkeys
[0:57:18] <%BoomerUnchained> shoot elf things
[0:57:19] <coracor> they totally are
[0:57:21] <%SilvaChariot0133> They creepin on up
[0:57:21] <%Alazull> When you have them highlighted hit R, it will make them move at normal speed
[0:57:22] <+Remery_> Too scared
[0:57:23] <Mister_McDerp> they're just sitting there menacingly
[0:57:25] <yourliteraldog> this game would be cool with 49k units
[0:57:27] <OvaltineDream> do slingers still have the flat firing arc they had in the historic games?
[0:57:27] <%thebonebard> @pistachio_the_nut resolution bug, its fine
[0:57:29] <Personified134> @PatStaresAt so you cam make it so pressing 1 selects all your melee guys if you wanted
[0:57:31] <tacu_master> Put some long range units on the trees
[0:57:32] <KNWatcher> is that OBS messing with the health bars?
[0:57:33] <derap41> I don't know why pat change the internal resolution scale like its how the game renders it
[0:57:34] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt If you select your army, you can hold alt and left click drag your army in formation
[0:57:35] <%Kataguro> Use arrow keys to move your whole formation
[0:57:35] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt Spears in middle Swords on flanks
[0:57:35] <Arisato_II> they're shitting their elf pants
[0:57:37] <dinnydanny777> If you move behind the trees do you get some advantage?
[0:57:42] <zamzoph> Pat's impatient
[0:57:47] <tacu_master> Yeah
[0:57:47] <+oda_flobunaga> Hotkeys are kind of necessary for large army control
[0:57:49] <lilredmage> SKREE SKREE
[0:57:53] <%Valdorick> Everything has a faily flat firing arc - Warscape engine is a shit.
[0:57:54] <+Skyebaker> uhm no
[0:57:56] <%thebonebard> he already adressed the blinking ui, its just a resolution ug
[0:57:57] <+oda_flobunaga> no
[0:57:58] <RetributionP> pat gives up the highground
[0:57:58] <+Skyebaker> spears on flans
[0:58:00] <derap41> that's backwards
[0:58:00] <%legendscar01> Their all spears
[0:58:01] <+Skyebaker> alwauys
[0:58:02] <lloyddboy> PAT THEY'RE GETTING SHOT
[0:58:02] <jackeroff3> spears good against cavalry
[0:58:02] <%thebonebard> spears on flanks
[0:58:02] <%Valdorick> fairly*
[0:58:03] <Perky_EDF> Trees apply penalties to ranged attacks. Both ways.
[0:58:03] <ha2ken> Your rangers need to attack
[0:58:04] <Zombrocom> Spears on flanks
[0:58:07] <%Retinolgaming> Who said that? LUL That's wrong
[0:58:07] <%marsantas> Tutorial "don't push ahead" Pat " I'm gonna push ahead"
[0:58:14] <Charronia> Tactical genius
[0:58:14] <+Skyebaker> spears always on flanks ignore that one guy
[0:58:16] <+MidnightBurst12> reverse that
[0:58:17] <kazadog> thats the opposite of what you want
[0:58:19] <%Dementedpenguin> LUL
[0:58:20] <mattynezz> Spears on flanks is USUALLY better, since the enemy tries to flank with Calvary
[0:58:21] <dinnydanny777> There's arrows being fired
[0:58:21] <Firststrike_OW> LUL
[0:58:24] <klx5> fuck that guy in particular
[0:58:25] <Thewoodentree> WOOPS
[0:58:26] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt hold space bar to see the range of your missile units
[0:58:27] <%Kataguro> Oh no, the rats are throwing rocks at me
[0:58:27] <%Valdorick> Bad trade, weaken units, not lords.
[0:58:28] <huskarl_zap> throw at no shielded infantry
[0:58:28] <LegendGHT> is there normally a fast forward
[0:58:30] <%Binary_Fireball> that guy can pack a lot ofrocks
[0:58:31] <StromkoPenguin> Most ranged units are terrible against individuals such as heroes.
[0:58:34] <%thebonebard> no spears on flanks
[0:58:34] <lilredmage> Wow. Guess you could say your rock strategy was BOLDER than the elves strategy
[0:58:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> The lord is like "HA these rats are OH GOD WHAT THE FUCK
[0:58:37] <%MisterRockett> You might wanna just charge em
[0:58:41] <%thebonebard> i mean put spears on flanks
[0:58:42] <dinnydanny777> Shouldn't you attack the archers in the back?
[0:58:42] <Daxalog> Why is the ui flashing? Are you holding down a key?
[0:58:42] <%Kataguro> White Lions of Chrace LUL LUL

[0:58:44] <Mister_McDerp> White Lions of Crap
[0:58:51] <%MisterRockett> Or put em in guard mode
[0:58:53] <%ckangaroo15k> No pat, those projectiles shouldn't go for the lord.

[0:58:57] <+razielhex> White Lions were super fun to play in WarHammer: Age of Reckoning

[0:59:16] <+razielhex> Queek Headtaker is like the most powerful goddamned assassin in end-times.

[0:59:17] <kulmoth> ????
[0:59:18] <+eggstyr0ne> @PatStaresAt you can move your unit selection by holding alt and dragging them
[0:59:18] <+Remery_> Queek is the anime protagonist
[0:59:26] <mach01_> look at how fast queek melts this simp
[0:59:27] <+eggstyr0ne> in formation
[0:59:35] <scrublord009> Man I miss For Honor
[0:59:35] <lilredmage> @BallerSwagBro9k Well okay, but youre gonna have to wait in line behind Ed Boon and whoever wrote the Special Zone jingle in Sonic 2
[0:59:37] <%Binary_Fireball> Queek is hawt
[0:59:38] <%Kataguro> Yeah but Queek
[0:59:39] <coracor> yeah so you need to abuse queek
[0:59:43] <mattynezz> HElves are super strong
[0:59:46] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Let he who is without Elves cast the first stone
[0:59:49] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt use your missiles to shoot their missile
[0:59:49] <%TrafficCohen> @PatStaresAt When armys are in hand to hand, archers aiming at enemys can cause friendly fire. It matters less for Skaven but I would say to try and flank with the archers or aim for enemy archers
[0:59:51] <lloyddboy> YEET-YEET
[0:59:52] <%Alazull> Have slingers fire on his ranged
[0:59:52] <%Estuko> @scrublord009 it's so fun but I don't have any drive to return to it FeelsBadMan
[0:59:55] <%VashyronM> One of the slingers isn't shooting
[0:59:56] <Arisato_II> A GLORIOUS VICTORY WILL SURE BE YOURS
[1:00:02] <%Binary_Fireball> focus archers on losing battles
[1:00:03] <dinnydanny777> The ranged seem like they're a problem
[1:00:06] <derap41> Pat why did you change the internal resolution scaling?
[1:00:06] <yourliteraldog> Do you have the blood dlc
[1:00:10] <%Punchasaur> their archers are pelting you
[1:00:10] <%Valdorick> If the enemy commits their entire melee line to your melee line, either use your missiles on their missiles, or run your missiles behind their line and hit them in the back.
[1:00:12] <+theKingRamses> turn off skirmish mode
[1:00:14] <+Solutha> shrimish mode wont let them
[1:00:14] <kulmoth> skirmish mode

[1:00:20] <%Piemono> His slingers don't have the range and they're in skirmish mode

[1:00:22] <mattynezz> Protip: Your missles have Friendly Fire, and your dudes suck ass at aiming
[1:00:22] <Perky_EDF> Skirmish mode is active. They avoid getting too close to enemies.
[1:00:24] <Zombrocom> Oh god turn off skirmish mode
[1:00:25] <+Rofiarf> turn of skirmish mode on the ranged units
[1:00:26] <%MonsterEnvy> Oh they are in Skirmish mode so they won't get close to enemies
[1:00:30] <HazaTheRaider> circle around the side and fire missiles into the flank?

[1:05:34] <Mister_McDerp> for tutroial clanrats, but normally go for skavenslaves
[1:05:34] <@mothmandraws> you choose pat you are the big rat who makes the rules
[1:05:34] <+razielhex> The White Dorf Grombrindal and Malekith are still buddies.
[1:05:34] <Esparsenior> Skavenslaves are literally the worst units in the game. Only get them for artillery armies
[1:05:36] <derap41> Clan Rats because they generally better
[1:05:36] <%Metballs> I know literally nothing but take the 2nd because of reasons
[1:05:37] <%MonsterEnvy> Clanrats are best with queek cause of queek
[1:05:38] <huskarl_zap> KLAN RATZ
[1:05:39] <j0ustar> it's a tutorial. explore.
[1:05:40] <VigilantShield> that is perfect reflection of how the rats actually work none agree and they just squabble
[1:05:41] <+eossg1> oh ya do clanrats for queek
[1:05:41] <+p4ntless> 2x slingers 1x clanrat spears
[1:05:42] <+Remery_> Queek buffs
[1:05:43] <Perky_EDF> Clanrats hold enemies down and Slingers can hit them.
[1:05:44] <%legendscar01> Yeah
[1:05:45] <%Kataguro> Good picks
[1:05:46] <$Caped_Eggy> They are also better units
[1:05:47] <+carltonnzz> clanrats if you got cash to spend slaves if you need cash
[1:05:47] <+theKingRamses> good spread
[1:05:48] <+oda_flobunaga> Good
[1:05:48] <lilredmage> The War Marches On!
[1:05:49] <Thewoodentree> SUCK UP
[1:05:49] <%Binary_Fireball> good
[1:05:50] <%StaceMcGate> Slaves suck, but you can easy stack 20 of them
[1:05:52] <%DukeMoose> Queek!
[1:05:52] <Zombrocom> Well advisor likes it
[1:05:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> 20th century demorats
[1:05:59] <mach01_> DEFENSE SPENDING
[1:06:00] <%StaceMcGate> get 2 armies with 20 slaves
[1:06:02] <%MaddyCaddy> Both units suck, slaves just cost less
[1:06:02] <Klarrann3> psaUp psaUp psaUp psaUp
[1:06:02] <%MisterRockett> What are you lacking?
[1:06:06] <twoto858> I didn't know this game had LOTR giant beast fights
[1:06:07] <%YakumoYomi> Is Pat the giant rat, that makes all of da rules?
[1:06:09] <%Pappajimbo> Skaven are John Calhoun's Rat Utopia becoming an empire
[1:06:10] <+Remery_> Why do rats care about money?
[1:06:11] <%MisterRockett> Take what you have less of.
[1:06:12] <+razielhex> He's against Teclis' area? With the Slaan just north?
[1:06:12] <+theKingRamses> more food = good
[1:06:13] <+lag2993> does pat have the warp firearms dlc
[1:06:22] <%Madbearv> So are you Jerma now Pat?
[1:06:23] <yourliteraldog> Slaves are the most disposable of cannon fodder
[1:06:26] <derap41> @lag2993 he has all dlc
[1:06:28] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Remery_ Money shiny
[1:06:33] <Arisato_II> rats learn how to invest
[1:06:36] <+razielhex> Looks like south Lustria to me
[1:06:36] <Pookiedaexzile> What button is too eat cheese
[1:06:36] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt It's a pretty good strategy with skaven to have a second army follow your main army around loaded with nothing but skavenslaves to act as meat shields
[1:06:39] <+lag2993> yes the fire teams are the best
[1:06:43] <+Remery_> @Valentinius_Anodyne oh super forgot

[1:22:59] <%Valdorick> Yeah, but VALUE
[1:22:59] <+theKingRamses> but you lost only rats
[1:23:00] <%Binary_Fireball> Terrain is super important keeping hills is a must
[1:23:00] <%Kataguro> But you're rats

[1:23:02] <EASrake> yeah but they shitty rats
[1:23:03] <Thewoodentree> thats skaven for ya
[1:23:04] <coracor> rats are infinitely more replaceable
[1:23:05] <twgrb06> rats are cheap and replacable
[1:23:05] <%Piemono> Rat units have lot of models
[1:23:05] <%SirGO0SE> a VICTORY
[1:23:06] <bolero765> glorious victory
[1:23:07] <Monkeyweed21> you broke formation and gave up high ground immediately cumbo
[1:23:07] <Wondabarrapa> skaven casualties don't matter at all
[1:23:07] <+rowboat_girlyman> you can recover them faster though
[1:23:07] <+scarman125> it's a win cause they ran away
[1:23:08] <+NitronStreams> A STUNNING VICTORY
[1:23:08] <%ckangaroo15k> You deployed more.
[1:23:08] <%Valdorick> Rats are about VALUE TRADING
[1:23:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> They ran, so you win by default
[1:23:08] <Mister_McDerp> high casualties is a big win for skaven
[1:23:08] <%baronblank> you had more guys
[1:23:08] <+bugz_munny> Skaven
[1:23:08] <+eggstyr0ne> most battles will be close victories. dont worry about it
[1:23:09] <Arisato_II> honorable victory
[1:23:09] <HazaTheRaider> you're rats, they're elves
[1:23:09] <LeBlanc233> thats how the rats win
[1:23:09] <%bluescreen1988> because rats
[1:23:10] <Ser_Randal> Skaven
[1:23:11] <lilredmage> YOU BROKE EVEN
[1:23:11] <SilentEric> You had more to lose
[1:23:12] <+oda_flobunaga> More left standing
[1:23:12] <apupupu> its ok rats breed 1000x faster
[1:23:12] <+theKingRamses> RATS ARE DIRT CHEAP, GOOD WIN
[1:23:12] <+Wizbiz_McBrix> What is this an army for ants?
[1:23:12] <PROUD2beGINGER> You lost units better than they did
[1:23:13] <Arisato_II> WIN IS WIN
[1:23:13] <%SirPickelchips> your units arent worth anything haha
[1:23:13] <%xShenzi> Their units are worth more
[1:23:14] <Soginha> Win Gives XP
[1:23:14] <sendart> your units are cheap as fuck
[1:23:14] <Pookiedaexzile> VERMINTIDE
[1:23:14] <%IDTheftVictim> Why we still on rats? Weren't we gonna Paunch
[1:23:14] <+Deus_ExNihilo> one elf is worth like ten skaven
[1:23:15] <@mothmandraws> "acceptable losses"
[1:23:16] <+bugz_munny> Skaven slaves die
[1:23:16] <+Rofiarf> your rats fighting elves
[1:23:17] <bellegrio> they pussed out first
[1:23:17] <%arcaderabbit48> Because they lost people, and you lost rats
[1:23:17] <%marsantas> Because they ran and you didn't
[1:23:18] <dinnydanny777> Win by attrition
[1:23:20] <%BeatH7> @PatStaresAt because yours are 100x less worthy
[1:23:21] <frankavich> You didn't win, the other guy lost!
[1:23:22] <%Nekros4442> Cus Rats cost less
[1:23:23] <derap41> How this game calculate victory rating is all kinds of fucked Pat don't trust it
[1:23:23] <+eggstyr0ne> yeah
[1:23:24] <%TaterBurglar> Did they flee the field? Then you won
[1:23:25] <%BoomerUnchained> ye
[1:23:26] <Twistedwolfie> yes
[1:23:27] <%Mr_Pylon> Yeah you gave up the hill to charge to flat ground
[1:23:29] <+oda_flobunaga> OH yeah
[1:23:31] <+MidnightBurst12> yes
[1:23:31] <skykingcrow> They ran away is why you won
[1:23:32] <Mister_McDerp> units suck fighting uphill
[1:23:32] <dinnydanny777> You won by attrition
[1:23:33] <GarbageQueenEllie> I have the HIGH GROUND Ani!
[1:23:33] <+bugz_munny> Rats slaves are just that, fodder
[1:23:33] <camelwizard> Because rats have loads of cheap units, each individual of yours is worth less than theirs
[1:23:34] <%legendscar01> Potion of healing nice
[1:23:34] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> haven't you watched fucking star wars
[1:23:34] <%thelonechris> Eat ass
[1:23:34] <%Binary_Fireball> High ground SUPER BIG DEAL
[1:23:36] <RetributionP> okay pat the worst thing that you did was you ran down the hill for some reason
[1:23:36] <+eggstyr0ne> units fighting down hill get buffed
[1:23:37] <yourliteraldog> You dont want to loose it like anakin
[1:23:37] <%GabeSweetMan> nom
[1:23:37] <EASrake> Yeah fucking EAT EM
[1:23:38] <derap41> If you heal your units the game doesn't couunt that
[1:23:40] <%Binary_Fireball> TERRAIN SUPER IMPORTANT
[1:23:40] <Thewoodentree> HAS OBI WAN TAUGHT YOU NOTHING???
[1:23:41] <+MorelK> star wars taught you nothing
[1:23:41] <kazadaz> getting shelled sucks, there was no perfect play there
[1:23:43] <OToole42> never listen to the victory screen, it's racist against the swarm armies
[1:23:43] <$ItsRatman> dont worry about the victory types, a win's a win
[1:23:43] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[1:23:45] <%Valdorick> Rats are cheap, and punch above their value.
[1:23:45] <Monkeyweed21> the tutorial told you to stay put and defend the hill @PatStaresAt
[1:23:45] <Heartless_01> obi wan wasnt just saying that line for the memes
[1:23:47] <bolero765> 🐀 🐀 🐀
[1:23:47] <Wondabarrapa> an elf is worth like 10 skaven slaves
[1:23:48] <%Nekros4442> Terrain in general is a huge deal
[1:23:49] <rafaelba93> the BIGGEST deal
[1:23:50] <HazaTheRaider> oh my god that's so fast.... wonderful
[1:23:50] <%ckangaroo15k> You killed the same amount of 500 year old elf nobles as they killed your 5 year old rat trash.
[1:23:54] <OvaltineDream> eat the rich pat
[1:23:55] <Perky_EDF> Firing downhill gives a range boost and uphill a penalty.
[1:24:08] <+Rofiarf> it was fine, rats are hard
[1:24:10] <Bek_359> Skaven have HUGE overpopulation problems, troop losses mean literally nothing to them
[1:24:12] <+olliedelosa> Rat lives are worth substantially less than elf lives, pat
[1:24:12] <kazadaz> defending the hill sucks when the enemy has more arty
[1:24:13] <lilredmage> Rat Town here we come

[1:27:11] <%Binary_Fireball> nuculor ganz
[1:27:11] <$Caped_Eggy> Ikit got nuclear bombs
[1:27:13] <%SilvaChariot0133> Uranium-Fucking Guns 🤔
[1:27:13] <dinnydanny777> The rats have figured out how to make people expendable
[1:27:14] <Wondabarrapa> should have played rat tony stark
[1:27:15] <Badgerconda_> GUN GUN GUN GUN GUN
[1:27:15] <%starotter70> Rats go BANG BANG
[1:27:16] <%Valdorick> RAILGUN SNIPERS
[1:27:18] <+atin2000> That is also the plan for the empire
[1:27:21] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> they habe machine guns nukes snipers etc
[1:27:22] <kulmoth> its not just guns its fucking energie weapons
[1:27:25] <%Shadicara> Do you have rats in planes though??
[1:27:26] <%plus_on_black> Rat Bastard is hand
[1:27:26] <%Nekros4442> Rats also have literal ninjas
[1:27:29] <RevolverBobkat> not just fire, but warp fire
[1:27:29] <%Kataguro> Pat, you're in an Ambush. Surround them
[1:27:34] <%Valdorick> RAT MEN CAN INTO SPACE
[1:27:34] <HazaTheRaider> chat, what's the setting to make forests seethrough?
[1:27:34] <kazadaz> Pat try pressing K again in this battle
[1:27:36] <dinnydanny777> The rats have figure out how to make rats expendable
[1:27:38] <%Binary_Fireball> It's funny because queek is khorne and khorne hates guns
[1:27:43] <%plus_on_black> Rat Bastard is gang gang
[1:27:43] <+oda_flobunaga> SURROUND THEM
[1:27:46] <twgrb06> you can double click units to jump to them
[1:27:49] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @Nekros4442 better than ninjas they actually kill other assasins
[1:27:49] <+Blackjackal95> They are a swarm and missiles/artillery race, even with huge damage ninjas
[1:27:50] <Firststrike_OW> You can spawn on the otherside as well pat
[1:27:51] <kazadaz> get super close
[1:27:52] <+scarman125> after over 500 hours in this game and just as much in the previous game i learned there are premade formations
[1:27:52] <derap41> Your favorite units so far
[1:27:55] <Perky_EDF> @scarman125 they require you to be in close range and have flanking. Hard not to erase a unit in that situation, but there's plenty of other "Hammer" units that don't require as much effort.
[1:27:57] <%Punchasaur> RAT-A-TAT-TAT MOTHAFUCKA
[1:27:57] <Pookiedaexzile> The Rats are truly the ones who make all da rules
[1:27:59] <l33tc4k3> way playing fall of the samurai and wow guns in that are something else
[1:28:00] <Mister_McDerp> go on the other side so trees don't block your shots
[1:28:03] <JackalKing> If you double click on the unit card it will jump your camera to their location
[1:28:03] <dinnydanny777> Do the trees protect you from ranged attackers?
[1:28:03] <Wondabarrapa> how much friendly fire do you guys think pat is gonna commit with the warpfire throwers
[1:28:06] <%Pappajimbo> they made a hamster wheel of death
[1:28:06] <%Kataguro> Get them from both sides
[1:28:07] <derap41> Not in the woods
[1:28:08] <CuttleCrow> two fronts?
[1:28:08] <RetributionP> just click on the picture to find units
[1:28:09] <%Kataguro> Ambus
[1:28:10] <%Binary_Fireball> a lot
[1:28:13] <Perky_EDF> There is no friendly fire
[1:28:13] <%QuadraticGravity> Try putting the warpfire throwers on the opposite side
[1:28:14] <kazadaz> AMBUSH, surround them
[1:28:15] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @dinnydanny777 yes
[1:28:17] <%Shadicara> Pincer them
[1:28:19] <+rowboat_girlyman> use the time controls
[1:28:20] <+Rofiarf> its an ambush so you can surround em if you want, not necessarry.
[1:28:21] <+rowboat_girlyman> top right
[1:28:21] <yourliteraldog> Korne hates mages guns are okay so long as your not a pussy
[1:28:21] <Thewoodentree> PINCER THEM
[1:28:24] <%Valdorick> The answer is "It doesn't matter, fuck those bitch-bitches
[1:28:24] <lloyddboy> humping the spawn door
[1:28:24] <+p4ntless> they're anti-dwarfs, they're the tech race that lives in clans underground but their backstabbing dickbag ways, verminous growth and complete lack of regard for convention and tradition means they have the craziest bullshit and do not care if it kills more of them than it does whoever they're pointing it at
[1:28:24] <tetriata> @Wondabarrapa acceptable amounts
[1:28:27] <$ItsRatman> DP THEM PAT
[1:28:28] <Arisato_II> SPLIT
[1:28:28] <%Binary_Fireball> They're not going to advance on you
[1:28:29] <$Caped_Eggy> There is friendly fire
[1:28:30] <%Shadicara> No survivors
[1:28:35] <+idols_of_idols> im guessing pat hasn't gotten the expansion with clan skryre?
[1:28:36] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt watch out for friendly fire with warpfire
[1:28:36] <Arisato_II> Divide and conquer
[1:28:38] <Perky_EDF> It's why Warpfire throwers are painful. You have toflank in order to hit or they wont fire.
[1:28:39] <%Kataguro> Yeeeeeah, now you're getting it
[1:28:39] <+theKingRamses> there we go
[1:28:40] <$Caped_Eggy> For range units
[1:28:41] <derap41> Ranged units should be in the open and melee fast in the woods
[1:28:44] <+Valask> which has cooler lore, Warhammer or Warhammer 40K?
[1:28:44] <+Blackjackal95> Snikch is amazing
[1:28:45] <dinnydanny777> They seem extremely outnumbered
[1:28:46] <+oda_flobunaga> There you go!
[1:28:47] <CuttleCrow> there we go
[1:28:50] <%Valdorick> There is friendly fire... there's also SKAVAN-fire, which is "who gives a fuck, those units cost nothing"
[1:28:54] <JackalKing> Now you're thinking with warpstone
[1:29:00] <%legendscar01> lol
[1:29:01] <RetributionP> put them in trees
[1:29:09] <%Binary_Fireball> do you think they snort warpstone?
[1:29:18] <JackalKing> They ABSOLUTELY snort warpstone
[1:29:25] <%Binary_Fireball> ah good
[1:29:27] <%Valdorick> They do snort it, ITS IN LORE THAT THEY SNORT IT
[1:29:27] <derap41> @RetributionP ranged units should not be in trees
[1:29:28] <%legendscar01> they just use it for everything
[1:29:31] <+scarman125> @Perky_EDF i usually try to use elevation more than flanking you can get some pretty nice shots with the right terrain. i usually use irondrakes more admittedly but they're very similar.
[1:29:31] <Arisato_II> damn, 3 groups
[1:29:32] <%Binary_Fireball> oh is it!??!?!
[1:29:33] <%thebonebard> @Valdorick still need them to survive enough to hold them down
[1:29:33] <Mister_McDerp> so many control groups NotLikeThis
[1:29:35] <+Blackjackal95> They eat it
[1:29:37] <+oda_flobunaga> this is good yesssss yesssssss
[1:29:37] <Firststrike_OW> These poor elves LUL
[1:29:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Skaven are the Methheads of Warhammer

[1:29:49] <+rowboat_girlyman> top right
[1:29:50] <%Shadicara> Fuck the elves
[1:29:52] <bolero765> RIP elves
[1:29:52] <+rowboat_girlyman> goooood
[1:29:52] <CuttleCrow> gonna get swarmed before they have a chance to do anything
[1:29:53] <Zombrocom> I usually have 4- 6 control groups
[1:29:59] <%Punchasaur> yo queek you wanna get hella warped
[1:30:00] <Bek_359> On tabletop, you're not allowed to shoot at a unit that your dudes are in melee with. UNLESS you're Skaven, because Skaven don't give a fuck.
[1:30:02] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> if i recall one skaven enemy os queek snorted a shit ton of warpstone to fight
[1:30:07] <%MaddyCaddy> You have them locked
[1:30:13] <HazaTheRaider> he's getting it Pogchamp
[1:30:15] <Perky_EDF> @scarman125 Irondrakes are what I wish Warpfire throwers were. Or atleast just let them fire into melee.
[1:30:19] <+p4ntless> skaven are basically what if a meth head figured out how to make a meth powered gatling gun
[1:30:19] <RetributionP> ranged it more likely to be attacked by ranged. it's better to be in trees then out in the open vs ranged
[1:30:20] <KingVantq> tdogWL
[1:30:23] <%MaddyCaddy> If they're in a locked group they automatically pick a different target
[1:30:26] <%TaterBurglar> I left for a bit, how is the campaign going?
[1:30:31] <Heyestus> Try to leave one block of melee rats free so they can circle around and hit from the side @PatStaresAt
[1:30:33] <lilredmage> the rats march victoriously
[1:30:34] <%Binary_Fireball> finishing up tutorial
[1:30:38] <%Binary_Fireball> then on to campaing
[1:30:41] <%Binary_Fireball> campaign*
[1:30:44] <JackalKing> When you have their control group selected and its "locked" you can just right click on any unit and they will all automatically pick the target in front of them.
[1:30:45] <%Bane_Kaikyo> bois?
[1:30:51] <%legendscar01> Its interesting seeing a beginner play this lol
[1:30:52] <yourliteraldog> Would you rather lick a nurgle cultist or leave your drink unattended at slanneshi house party.

[1:35:11] <%YakumoYomi> Praise be to Yevon, brudda.
[1:35:13] <+Remery_> Rats are brave cowards
[1:35:17] <%Valdorick> Its not that much
[1:35:17] <laguerrilha> eat the whole city, no survivors
[1:35:19] <Heartless_01> LUL
[1:35:21] <%Binary_Fireball> take your time
[1:35:21] <%Kataguro> They all suck. Kill them all
[1:35:22] <%Ner234> stab stab LUL
[1:35:22] <Perky_EDF> Don't forget to use The Menace Below.
[1:35:24] <%Binary_Fireball> Pause often
[1:35:24] <Arisato_II> ohno
[1:35:25] <Twistedwolfie> its fineeeeee
[1:35:25] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> siege
[1:35:26] <+oda_flobunaga> Siege and build shit
[1:35:26] <dinnydanny777> Burn the city
[1:35:28] <%arcaderabbit48> DEVOUR-our-our
[1:35:30] <Mister_McDerp> put some food into menace from below if you need it
[1:35:31] <yourliteraldog> WORLD IS A FUCk
[1:35:31] <Monkeyweed21> THE MENACE BELOW
[1:35:31] <GameOver_Here> Scout the map
[1:35:31] <Klarrann3> eat the elf-things
[1:35:32] <derap41> warp Fire is your killer make sure to flank with it
[1:35:32] <JackalKing> I believe in your, Ginger Goblin
[1:35:33] <%heartlesshealer> bite-feast man-things!
[1:35:33] <%Shadicara> Fuck it burn the town and eat the kids
[1:35:33] <%legendscar01> Menece below, free clanrats units
[1:35:34] <Azathotic> ***
[1:35:37] <zamzoph> pillage-burn!
[1:35:37] <Perky_EDF> It's free units that can screw over the AI
[1:35:38] <bolero765> x4 menace below summons is good
[1:35:39] <$ItsRatman> Uh oh he didnt menace below
[1:35:39] <HazaTheRaider> Rat Ogres smash the gates down and bumrush
[1:35:41] <+oda_flobunaga> Maintain siege
[1:35:43] <Zombrocom> Send rats in first, get stuck in, summon rats behind them and flank
[1:35:49] <%StaceMcGate> don't have to defend under city
[1:35:50] <%Kataguro> Heroes can make undercities without having to fight
[1:35:51] <%StaceMcGate> and it can expand
[1:35:53] <kazadaz> Some land is not worth owning/defending
[1:35:54] <mach01_> because undercity allows you to do crazy shit like make nukes
[1:35:55] <+pistachio_the_nut> You can make a ton of money
[1:35:55] <yourliteraldog> you get cool shit
[1:35:55] <%DukeMoose> because you steal from them
[1:35:55] <%Piemono> Cities cost food for skaven
[1:35:56] <%MaddyCaddy> Free money no food cost
[1:35:56] <%lassieme> Food
[1:35:57] <SGrim> Resources over time mostly
[1:35:57] <Mister_McDerp> normally you use agents to create the undercities
[1:35:58] <derap41> There is Hostile climate that makes the place worthless
[1:35:58] <bolero765> don't have to feed an undercity
[1:35:59] <Perky_EDF> Undercity for cities not in your line of conquest. Also free food like crazy
[1:35:59] <Klarrann3> food, money, expansion
[1:36:01] <+scarman125> @PatStaresAt you can establish under cities with agents
[1:36:01] <%marsantas> Because you can spread them to other cities from them
[1:36:03] <$Salty3acon> undercities have buildings for food and big money
[1:36:03] <%heartlesshealer> Surfies will find them more easily if not undercity lore-wise
[1:36:04] <%street_sign> it can spread
[1:36:04] <Soginha> agents can make undecity
[1:36:04] <JackalKing> You can put under cities ANYWHERE. You could put them all the way across the map. It also generates more food
[1:36:06] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt put an undercity into a strong factions capital, and leech off their money
[1:36:07] <%Kataguro> Like the Wood Elf shit
[1:36:07] <CrimsonFox777> They're whole empire is underground. Only makes sense.
[1:36:08] <Veluren> You can also plant a nuke in an undercity to instantly destroy a city
[1:36:08] <+eossg1> some land isn't hospital
[1:36:08] <VigilantShield> because you don't need an army and the map is huge you could just send one hero out to spam them
[1:36:09] <%GabeSweetMan> Like Detroit!
[1:36:09] <+Wizbiz_McBrix> I thought Pat was saying Waaagh-tek, and was very confused since he's not playing orks.
[1:36:09] <+bestcup> don't have to defend it and makes money
[1:36:10] <Wondabarrapa> the undercity can expand everywhere
[1:36:10] <%king_wragles> Undercities don't have to be defended, and they lead to nukes iirc
[1:36:13] <Bek_359> also, DOOMSPHERES
[1:36:13] <%SirPickelchips> send agents to set up undercity in far away cities youre not gonna fight for a while
[1:36:13] <+ishouldfeelbad> its free income
[1:36:14] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt you can also build nukes in undercities
[1:36:15] <$ItsRatman> you dont undercity someone you were gonna kill. undercity someone far awat or even an ally
[1:36:19] <+Remery_> No one is going underground to fight mutant rats
[1:36:19] <%Shadicara> That's a big rat squad
[1:36:22] <+rowboat_girlyman> you won't see them until the game starts
[1:36:22] <derap41> As you attack you deploy first
[1:36:23] <$grotto_kein> Under citys can spread by themselves
[1:36:24] <+idols_of_idols> don't have to defend it can expand and you can... do some stuff with it
[1:36:25] <+oda_flobunaga> Defender advantage
[1:36:27] <+Rose_Silvers> you can't see defenders as attackers
[1:36:28] <neraren> Its Free Real Estate
[1:36:28] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt You can use warlock engineers to place undercitys without attacking, letting you start under citites deep in enemy territory
[1:36:29] <Klarrann3> research speed, construction cost reduction, campaign movement
[1:36:30] <HazaTheRaider> oh sick, not even walls
[1:36:31] <dinnydanny777> You should probably use the trees or something
[1:36:32] <%ryome> BIG RAT POSSE
[1:36:33] <JackalKing> @king_wragles Only Ikit Claw can make the warp bomb under city building
[1:36:36] <Perky_EDF> Personally, I prefer dropping a Vermintide under the entire empire all at once.
[1:36:36] <+ishouldfeelbad> plus undercities can spread on there own
[1:36:42] <%wolfofsound> of course he's a rat boy
[1:36:42] <Thewoodentree> PLUS FREE FOOD FROM ANY STUPID HUMI THAT WANDERS IN
[1:36:45] <%heartlesshealer> People are saying undercities lead to nukes. Perhaps made of warpstone
[1:36:45] <HazaTheRaider> slam the rats in front, rat ogres around the sides, slingers in the gaps
[1:36:51] <%Valdorick> Yeah yeah yeah! Roman it up! Strong center, fuck the flanks!
[1:36:52] <HazaTheRaider> and throw Warp Piss on them
[1:36:53] <%king_wragles> @JackalKing that adds up, I've only cared about Ikit tbh
[1:36:55] <+oda_flobunaga> TRY FORMATIONS
[1:36:59] <%king_wragles> Skaven wise that is
[1:37:03] <%FallenAngelZelos> Oh no this looks like a game I could really get into
[1:37:08] <%Shadicara> Make it look bigger for intimidation
[1:37:09] <%Binary_Fireball> create groups?
[1:37:12] <%legendscar01> The nuke of undercities is only for Clan Skyre guys
[1:37:12] <+ishouldfeelbad> the doomsphere is pretty long term for undercities
[1:37:15] <%VashyronM> Do not have the Ogres in the front line
[1:37:20] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> i think you can only get nukes when you habe kitclaw
[1:37:24] <derap41> Ogres should be on the flanks
[1:37:25] <zamzoph> stretch more!
[1:37:27] <JackalKing> @king_wragles Honestly, there is no reason to play any other skaven after ikit was release, except possibly for Snikch
[1:37:29] <%Binary_Fireball> ogres on the side yea
[1:37:43] <+oda_flobunaga> I have only played the Historical ones in the past but this looks like the shit!
[1:37:46] <Zombrocom> Snikch is almost as good as ikit, he can literally Delete factions
[1:37:49] <%heartlesshealer> there's roleplay funsie reasons
[1:37:49] <Sundaysmiles01> do we have warpstone nukes yet?
[1:37:50] <tmanner> I thought pat was goin to play pauch?
[1:37:52] <%Kataguro> This is extensive micro

[1:39:10] <OvaltineDream> Breathe lord captain patron
[1:39:10] <Heyestus> @PatStaresAt you can lock groups to stop that happening
[1:39:14] <%wolfofsound> @legendscar01 wouldn't you?
[1:39:16] <derap41> You're moving into their firing range
[1:39:16] <+rowboat_girlyman> all melee infantry grouped, all ranged infantry grouped, then group the rest by category
[1:39:19] <+Remery_> He panics just like the rat boys
[1:39:20] <%baronblank> the more the watch this and read chat, the more I realize I have no idea how to play and think I probably won't ever
[1:39:24] <JackalKing> You picked a god time to screw up. It could have been worse. You could have done that when you were within range of the enemy
[1:39:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> Formations what are those
[1:39:28] <%legendscar01> @wolfofsound yeah lol
[1:39:28] <Mister_McDerp> unlock it
[1:39:29] <+oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Now, look at what they have and react accordingly
[1:39:30] <+Partialrecall2> this reminds me of when i bought cities skylines: it looked awesome until i actually played it cause the 'depth' just makes it a goddamn headache to play
[1:39:31] <%Kataguro> Groups really aren't that important. YOu don't have to worry about them
[1:39:32] <lilredmage> Breathe and squeak
[1:39:33] <Zombrocom> Unlock it
[1:39:35] <CuttleCrow> just ask the other army if you can retreat, just had a formation oopie

[1:42:16] <kazadaz> Summon rats on top of their archers
[1:42:17] <%Valdorick> Yeah, High elves has A LOT of archers, even when it doesn't seem like they do.
[1:42:18] <@mothmandraws> pat look at button on right hand of screen

[1:42:43] <%Binary_Fireball> spears will come up in front of archers
[1:42:44] <Perky_EDF> @PatStaresAt You can use your ability on the right to spawn a unit of Clanrats. It's great for dropping right on top of Archers.
[1:42:44] <%VashyronM> You can summon rats on the archers so they'll stop shooting
[1:42:44] <%optimasmaximas> mothman i doubt he will see what you said
[1:42:45] <+rowboat_girlyman> remeber the ALT+ click move
[1:42:47] <twgrb06> Not fun? This is super fun
[1:42:48] <Wondabarrapa> imagine training with a bow and arrow for 100 years only to get burned alive by a drugged up rat with a flamethrower
[1:42:49] <derap41> Pat the lock means that you're locking their formation not that you're locking the group
[1:42:51] <Monkeyweed21> menace below Pat
[1:42:52] <tmanner> your commander has spells aswell pat
[1:42:53] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt you can summon more rats with the ability on the right

[1:43:05] <+scarman125> i almost never use groups
[1:43:06] <RantingRavager> afaik, if you have their formation locked, you can right click the enemy to auto-target groups
[1:43:08] <$grotto_kein> Hit the rat party button

[1:44:02] <kazadaz> Pat you gotta surround and flank, there's HUGE combat debuffs to flanked units
[1:44:04] <%maskedriderhero> theyre slaverats, its actually better that they are dying
[1:44:06] <derap41> Pat you can double click the unit card to have the camera move to the unit
[1:44:06] <%wolfofsound> playing in slow mo is the way to go
[1:44:08] <Perky_EDF> Shock Cavalry too

[1:45:27] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt Lock formation only locks the positions the units take on the map, not locks the formation so it wont change, I recommend not locking for formations to make micro easier
[1:45:30] <Heyestus> summon the vermintide
[1:45:30] <+scarman125> i think his warpfire throwers melted his own units

[1:45:43] <%xShenzi> you can rotate menace from below btw
[1:45:47] <Mister_McDerp> you can turn the menace from below around
[1:45:53] <yourliteraldog> can you pop inside a formation

[1:50:51] <$ItsRatman> nothing look a good goresplosion
[1:50:51] <+oda_flobunaga> Now that is some Peter Jackson shiiiiit!
[1:50:51] <HazaTheRaider> oh god save that fleeing rat ogre unit
[1:50:52] <%Kataguro> But like it's fine
[1:50:52] <%scifimisc> Nah you did great
[1:50:54] <BakerBrute> Its a GREAT Mess
[1:50:54] <kazadaz> all skaven fights are messes
[1:50:54] <Twistedwolfie> its fineeee
[1:50:54] <Mister_McDerp> but you won, and thats all that matters
[1:50:55] <Zombrocom> Warface IS a mess
[1:50:55] <@mothmandraws> all skaven fights are like this
[1:50:56] <%MonsterEnvy> You just won
[1:50:56] <zamzoph> I'd prefer a clean fight
[1:50:57] <%SilvaChariot0133> They are running
[1:50:58] <derap41> eh
[1:50:58] <+Remery_> like all Skaven fights
[1:50:58] <bolero765> a win is a win
[1:51:01] <HazaTheRaider> you can replenish them but don't let them be wiped out
[1:51:01] <+Sendaar> You did alright
[1:51:01] <+scarman125> a win is a win
[1:51:02] <Parapattern> Get Outta MAH SWAMP
[1:51:02] <+theKingRamses> that is how rat fights generally are
[1:51:02] <%ckangaroo15k> That's how all battles end.
[1:51:04] <Onmi_Khaos> And who cares?
[1:51:05] <derap41> you're learning shit is gonna show
[1:51:06] <%VashyronM> You won
[1:51:07] <OvaltineDream> Not the cleanest operation
[1:51:07] <%Valdorick> All Skaven fights go EVERYWHERE.
[1:51:07] <Heartless_01> but your rats cannot be stopped!
[1:51:07] <twgrb06> Remind Pat to set units on Guard so they don't chase and get tired, and also not to run units everywhere
[1:51:07] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> feels appropriate for rats
[1:51:11] <$ItsRatman> This is war.
[1:51:12] <%schlager087> This is like watching daily life in New York
[1:51:13] <%silverira> WELL WAR IS A SHITSHOW
[1:51:14] <%MonsterEnvy> You won
[1:51:14] <Zombrocom> Welcome to Skaven
[1:51:15] <yourliteraldog> thats skaven
[1:51:15] <@SoFarFetched> You already won Pat
[1:51:18] <lilredmage> youre a bunch of rats! its supposed to be a messy shit show
[1:51:18] <Perky_EDF> Just doomstack Ratlings and watch the enemy never get within melee range haha
[1:51:18] <EASrake> Just keeping you units from chasing cleans up this fight a lot
[1:51:21] <+Sendaar> As long as you dont completely lose units its a pretty solid win
[1:51:22] <%Punchasaur> Patboy Genius
[1:51:23] <Onmi_Khaos> Pat. I have 1400 hours on Warhammer 1, i have 300 hours on Warhammer 2
[1:51:26] <Zebroneath> I would imagine that's what a fight with a rat army would look like
[1:51:27] <+oda_flobunaga> But you are winning. Ashina Strats
[1:51:27] <Onmi_Khaos> my fights are STILL a mess
[1:51:28] <yourliteraldog> they work best when they are a shit show
[1:51:29] <%scifimisc> Your only valuable units made it out fine
[1:51:33] <derap41> Guard mode means your units won't chase the enemy
[1:51:39] <Arisato_II> Shameful display
[1:51:43] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[1:51:43] <%MonsterEnvy> Guard means they won't chase enemies

[1:51:57] <%legendscar01> Pat is now ready for legendary
[1:51:58] <@mothmandraws> u did it
[1:52:01] <derap41> 7/10
[1:52:01] <twgrb06> The bar at the top will show who is winning
[1:52:02] <+rowboat_girlyman> you got a D
[1:52:02] <yourliteraldog> play gobos
[1:52:02] <%GohanHitsugaya> Congrats LUL
[1:52:06] <lilredmage> SUPREME VICTORY
[1:52:07] <%thebonebard> i like to have guard mode off because frequently my guys will end up behind the enemy open for flanking
[1:52:08] <%Kataguro> But you're a bunch of shitty rats
[1:52:08] <Mister_McDerp> a close victory is still a victory
[1:52:10] <+theKingRamses> now you're getting it
[1:52:11] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[1:52:13] <Zombrocom> You lost shitty rats who cares
[1:52:13] <+rowboat_girlyman> you'll make the losses back faster too
[1:52:14] <%scifimisc> Even losses for rats is super good
[1:52:15] <derap41> Loses for skaven don't count
[1:52:17] <Perky_EDF> That's the right mindset
[1:52:20] <Monkeyweed21> 800 to 200 lol
[1:52:21] <tmanner> don't listen to the game the game lies
[1:52:21] <@mothmandraws> skaven, undead and orcs kinda want "close" and "phyrric" victories as they can just rebuild fast
[1:52:21] <%QuadraticGravity> FOOD
[1:52:22] <Onmi_Khaos> Are all your units alive? Yes? Then you won!
[1:52:22] <Heyestus> This is the rat way!
[1:52:23] <+Dfreddy8> Dfreddy8 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:52:23] <%VashyronM> @PatStaresAt That's Warhammer baby
[1:52:23] <%Kataguro> Skaven society is about throwing everyone else in the trash
[1:52:26] <+Remery_> Queek untouched
[1:52:27] <yourliteraldog> Losses don't mean anything for skaven
[1:52:28] <%TaterBurglar> They're even numerically, but you're a bunch of rodents, so it's okay
[1:52:30] <%NovaKnightmare> Skaven die all the time
[1:52:31] <dinnydanny777> That was a ratastrophe for them
[1:52:33] <EASrake> THey lost dudes in armor, you lost some rats with sticks
[1:52:36] <%Valdorick> Their center flees, and your center chases
[1:52:43] <lilredmage> @dinnydanny777 nice!
[1:52:43] <derap41> Guard mode is to keep lines in shape
[1:52:44] <Perky_EDF> Technically didn't lose a single unit.
[1:52:45] <%thebonebard> they run behind the enemy line when retreating
[1:52:47] <%Valdorick> ... of course, you have to pay attention.
[1:52:48] <+The_Protagonist> Kill them all, Pat-er
[1:52:48] <%MonsterEnvy> They won't chase dudes in guard mode when they run
[1:52:48] <%optimasmaximas> queek prevails
[1:52:48] <+Rose_Silvers> i would reccomend going into game settings turning guard mode default on
[1:52:52] <Mister_McDerp> its useful sometimes to have your guys run fleeing dudes down
[1:52:52] <%Valdorick> So Guard mode for training wheels
[1:52:56] <Twistedwolfie> they kite you
[1:52:56] <%thebonebard> its preference
[1:52:59] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt So, with guard mode on, if the enemy runs away you units will not chase, so they can end up standing around
[1:52:59] <%legendscar01> Guard mode is good
[1:53:01] <%thebonebard> do what you want
[1:53:06] <yourliteraldog> Skaven are the empitomy of Might Makes Right
[1:53:08] <@mothmandraws> honestly I wouldnt worry pat go guard mode until you get used to when you dont want it
[1:53:11] <derap41> But turn it of for Cav and dogs
[1:53:12] <%thebonebard> my way isnt for everyone
[1:53:12] <%scifimisc> The only units you dont want on guard are cavalry
[1:53:16] <+oda_flobunaga> The only reason to keep pursue on is that it prevents morale healing
[1:53:20] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt So you turn it off when you DO want to chase
[1:53:21] <%heartlesshealer> then pause and redirect more
[1:53:21] <%BoomerUnchained> Eh, find the Set that works for you
[1:53:25] <$ItsRatman> They both have their benefits TBH
[1:53:26] <Monkeyweed21> this is helpful since Pat is very bad at strategy
[1:53:26] <Mister_McDerp> guard mode is good for ranged units especially
[1:53:27] <Klarrann3> Friendly fire exists, so try not to shoot from behind your troops if you don't want to slaughter your own
[1:53:28] <%QuadraticGravity> is there a mode of "When target flees, fight nearest target"
[1:53:31] <Heyestus> Guard mode should be toggled off for high mobility units, because they can chase quickly and mop up units fast
[1:53:33] <+rowboat_girlyman> use cavalry to chase units off the map
[1:53:34] <%MonsterEnvy> Guard is great for ranged
[1:53:36] <Onmi_Khaos> I turn on Guard mode for my ranged and leave it off for my flankers, but keeping my frontline with it on
[1:53:38] <%Valdorick> Note though that for high value units you route off the field, they have a lower chance of rallying if a unit is chasing them.
[1:53:39] <Mister_McDerp> pump that up to 3
[1:53:40] <+rowboat_girlyman> because they move faster
[1:53:40] <+theKingRamses> TIER 3
[1:53:40] <derap41> There are some units that you want to be chasing enemies but mostly Guard is better of on
[1:53:41] <tonfirean> I just came in, is this the giant rat that makes All Of Da Rules
[1:53:41] <Fien111> Guard mode is good when you're starting out, you can rely on them chasing later when you get a good rhythm of command going
[1:53:42] <Soginha> but your cavalry have to chase
[1:53:45] <+oda_flobunaga> use pause more or always play at 1/2 speed
[1:53:55] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt first sack then occupy
[1:53:55] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @QuadraticGravity you ask or you are sayin?
[1:53:58] <%Kataguro> Sack captures the city but fucks it up
[1:54:01] <%QuadraticGravity> I'm asking
[1:54:03] <derap41> Eat everyone
[1:54:03] <%TaterBurglar> Raze is burning it the fuck down
[1:54:04] <OvaltineDream> nliLUL
[1:54:07] <+theKingRamses> JUMP IT TO 3
[1:54:08] <%Estuko> EAT
[1:54:08] <kazadaz> don't sack, too little money
[1:54:09] <yourliteraldog> Plunder
[1:54:10] <+Sendaar> You can sack and then occupy if you want but it damages buildings
[1:54:10] <Zombrocom> Occupy at three seems good
[1:54:10] <Mister_McDerp> the tier pumping is a great mechanic unique to skaven
[1:54:11] <%scifimisc> Occupy!
[1:54:12] <%Kataguro> Loot and Occupy
[1:54:12] <kazadaz> this time anwyay
[1:54:14] <%thelonechris> Blow it the fuck up
[1:54:14] <$ItsRatman> occupy
[1:54:15] <yourliteraldog> 3
[1:54:15] <+eggstyr0ne> sacks also lower the citys lvl
[1:54:15] <alwayspronking> Sack breaks and takes money, Raze destroys the settlement to nothing
[1:54:16] <+rowboat_girlyman> occupy
[1:54:17] <%Shadicara> Loot them
[1:54:17] <+idols_of_idols> lvl3 good stuff
[1:54:19] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> loot and occupy wit ll
[1:54:21] <kazadaz> NO
[1:54:24] <%legendscar01> Occupy
[1:54:25] <%MaddyCaddy> Yes
[1:54:26] <+rowboat_girlyman> loot and occupy
[1:54:26] <%Valdorick> ITS YOUR HOME PROVICE, DON'T BURN IT
[1:54:26] <%MonsterEnvy> No Occupy
[1:54:27] <Zombrocom> Not with skaven
[1:54:28] <zamzoph> Sack-raze, yes-yes!
[1:54:28] <%thebonebard> occupy
[1:54:29] <Mister_McDerp> yeah sacking is great for farming levels
[1:54:29] <%TaterBurglar> That takes two turns, btw
[1:54:31] <Heyestus> sack, raze and underempire mean you don't get the settlement
[1:54:32] <bolero765> yes!
[1:54:33] <Drigoooooo> Sacking is good for farming exp
[1:54:36] <derap41> Sure why not
[1:54:39] <%MaddyCaddy> You want the food
[1:54:40] <Klarrann3> sack first, then occupy
[1:54:41] <%scifimisc> Yeah occupy
[1:54:41] <BakerBrute> Occupy Pretty much everything habitable as queek
[1:54:42] <Onmi_Khaos> Loot and occupy in your home settlement
[1:54:44] <$Salty3acon> sack wait a turn then raze if you want it gone, otherwise occupy
[1:54:45] <Zombrocom> Sacking takes a turn
[1:54:46] <%MaddyCaddy> Food is hard to get
[1:54:49] <%heartlesshealer> sacking is more for exp
[1:54:51] <derap41> Got Good loot
[1:54:55] <laguerrilha> we ate that whole city
[1:54:55] <%TaterBurglar> Sack -> raze or Sack-> Occupy will take two turns
[1:54:58] <Klarrann3> you can sack and occupy on the same turn
[1:54:59] <%SirGO0SE> RAT HOUSE PAT HOUSE
[1:55:12] <BakerBrute> Sacking a settlement drops the level of all the buildings by 1
[1:55:15] <+theKingRamses> very juicy
[1:55:16] <%MaddyCaddy> Now you're at -23 food
[1:55:19] <+oda_flobunaga> NOICE
[1:55:21] <+theoneGalen> Wat, Pat is trying this again?
[1:55:22] <lilredmage> so juicy
[1:55:22] <derap41> Check lightning strike Pat
[1:55:23] <%terminallyCapriciousz> j u i c y
[1:55:23] <yourliteraldog> Woe to the vanquished bitches
[1:55:23] <%MaddyCaddy> Hoongry rats
[1:55:23] <%QuadraticGravity> I think people said red line now
[1:55:24] <%wolfofsound> he seems nice :)
[1:55:25] <%VashyronM> You can occupy the same turn you sack. You can't raze the same turn you sack
[1:55:26] <alwayspronking> Having a teir 3 settlement this early is real good
[1:55:28] <Mister_McDerp> cunnig
[1:55:29] <OvaltineDream> Cheese for days boss
[1:55:29] <Zombrocom> Go down the redline
[1:55:29] <%heartlesshealer> negative food?
[1:55:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> Rats rats we are the rats. And eh is the big pat who makes all of the rules
[1:55:33] <Arisato_II> Queek city
[1:55:34] <%scifimisc> The blue skills are the best
[1:55:34] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> go for the red
[1:55:36] <+eggstyr0ne> yes
[1:55:37] <derap41> Lightning strike is something you really want
[1:55:39] <alwayspronking> that's fair. take red clanrat bonuses
[1:55:40] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt ancient cunning
[1:55:40] <Mister_McDerp> cunning is good
[1:55:42] <%whiskey_wolfe_> It wont matter
[1:55:42] <%MaddyCaddy> Queek is a duelist, so the yellow tree is better
[1:55:42] <%StaceMcGate> go for ancient cunning
[1:55:43] <%xShenzi> Lightning strike is hands down the most useful thing in the game
[1:55:43] <+eggstyr0ne> NO
[1:55:43] <Onmi_Khaos> You want to get Lightning Strike ASAP
[1:55:44] <+theoneGalen> that's anti-rattist
[1:55:45] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> hm...
[1:55:45] <%ckangaroo15k> NO
[1:55:46] <%thebonebard> no
[1:55:46] <BakerBrute> THE ONE GUY
[1:55:47] <%thebonebard> NO
[1:55:48] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> no
[1:55:49] <Zombrocom> Lightning strike is good, but much later
[1:55:49] <+eggstyr0ne> some of them are good
[1:55:50] <%Piemono> Lighting strike is great
[1:55:51] <BakerBrute> Blue is for suckas
[1:55:51] <derap41> check the second blue line
[1:55:52] <%scifimisc> Lighting strike is a blue skill
[1:55:52] <Heyestus> Depends how you like to play, my man.
[1:55:52] <+Rose_Silvers> @PatStaresAt lightning strike is a blue skill
[1:55:53] <Zombrocom> Do red first
[1:55:53] <Noctred192> RED IS BETTER
[1:55:53] <Mister_McDerp> down blue line
[1:55:53] <%StaceMcGate> LIGHTNING STRIKE IS BEST
[1:55:53] <yourliteraldog> ONE GUY
[1:55:54] <alwayspronking> 2nd tier blue
[1:55:54] <%Kataguro> You want Lightning Strike at some point
[1:55:55] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt MAKE QUEEK A MELE GOD
[1:55:55] <%MonsterEnvy> Farther on blue
[1:55:55] <%heartlesshealer> scroll through your skill tree
[1:55:57] <%StaceMcGate> INVEST IN AMBUSH
[1:55:57] <@mothmandraws> different trees depend on what you want
[1:55:57] <%Piemono> towards end of blue
[1:55:58] <kazadaz> Lightning strike is tier 2 blue
[1:55:59] <+Deschain212> lightning strike is usells as skaven
[1:55:59] <Perky_EDF> Lightning Strike is the best by far against the AI.
[1:56:00] <%Pappajimbo> cowards to the rat
[1:56:02] <%marsantas> Red makes army better
[1:56:02] <%thebonebard> BLUE SKILLS ARE MOST IGNORED
[1:56:03] <Jay444111> Hey Pat. How ya doing? Yay or nay on this game?
[1:56:04] <%bizmarkribeye> Blue skills suck
[1:56:04] <%ckangaroo15k> Queek is a fighter lord
[1:56:05] <derap41> That one is super important
[1:56:06] <%TaterBurglar> Pat just do whatever color you want
[1:56:08] <$ItsRatman> For the purposes of THIS session, start to dabble in red
[1:56:09] <%Valdorick> Blue Skills are semi-useful, but in this throw away game, who cares.
[1:56:12] <Mister_McDerp> blue skills are best
[1:56:14] <@mothmandraws> basically when 2 armies show up you can take them on 1 at a time
[1:56:15] <%legendscar01> Ancient Cunning
[1:56:18] <+scarman125> @PatStaresAt there is no better or worse. each tree has their own uses
[1:56:19] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt I always go for Lightning strike first
[1:56:22] <%Kataguro> Eh, that's fine
[1:56:27] <+theKingRamses> cheap to repair
[1:56:28] <darkodargon_2> :p
[1:56:29] <Drigoooooo> It depends on the lord
[1:56:29] <%scifimisc> Yellow makes the guy better, red makes the units better, blue makes your campaign easier
[1:56:32] <+p4ntless> lightning strikenlets you 1v1 enemy stacks without getting roped into bullshit 3v1 scenarios
[1:56:35] <%A0N33> Hey Pat, just wanted to let you know that I finally got through the post ARR quests and picked up Dark Knight! Thanks for convincing me to get into FF14, and for your tutorial streams.

[1:58:49] <Thewoodentree> IS PAUNCH BASED ON THE GOBLIN KING IN THE HOBBIT?
[1:58:54] <%Dfreddy8> Grom is just an Ork version of Pat SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc
[1:58:55] <%Kataguro> Yeah probably
[1:58:55] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I like how Grom has an orb, just like Pat :)
[1:58:56] <Ell1ot> that is not a belly. that is an orb or a large bag
[1:58:56] <SilentEric> @derap41 Vortex has a story to it.
[1:59:12] <SilentEric> @Ell1ot That is a PAUNCH
[1:59:29] <Ell1ot> whatever it is, someone needs to shake it
[1:59:35] <+sunriser101> the story on warhammer is simple, things are fucked, and they are getting worse
[1:59:45] <+lag2993> and then it was the end times
[1:59:50] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> ^
[1:59:53] <+Wizbiz_McBrix> And they never stop getting worse
[2:00:07] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> untill tey go to space...to do worst for the universe
[2:00:10] <SilentEric> Grom has a goblin sidekick named Niblet who is there to wave his banner, drive his chariot, and shake his paunch @Ell1ot
[2:00:11] <Thewoodentree> Warhammer is the best at dark comedy
[2:00:23] <huskarl_zap> WARBOSS PORBTRICK THE REDBEARD only hunts redbeared stunties

[2:01:06] <Arisato_II> Some say huge
[2:01:15] <Thewoodentree> @thebonebard Does this Warhammer have a book series?
[2:01:17] <+lag2993> if you want op just give tyrion the sword of khane
[2:01:19] <Monkeyweed21> Paunch must cook gud grubbinz n git dat elfy batman
[2:01:24] <privatesargent> you can cook troll meat to get rid of the regeneration since trolls are weak to fire, but Grom was too impatient to wait

[2:13:25] <Mister_McDerp> chariots
[2:13:25] <%MaddyCaddy> No
[2:13:26] <@commanderclaw> Chariots
[2:13:26] <Firststrike_OW> Theyre charriots
[2:13:27] <+Skwizgarr> cheap shock cav
[2:13:27] <BakerBrute> Chariots
[2:13:28] <Onmi_Khaos> chariots
[2:13:28] <%MaddyCaddy> They're chariots
[2:13:28] <%Piemono> Chariots
[2:13:29] <Zombrocom> Roller pump wagons are pretty decent in melee actually
[2:13:30] <SilentEric> They are good, against infantry
[2:13:31] <SGrim> They are chariots
[2:13:31] <%MonsterEnvy> Pump Wagons are Chariots kind of cave
[2:13:33] <derap41> Chariots
[2:13:39] <$ItsRatman> Chariots, do not use them like cavalry
[2:13:39] <+Lost_Zombie> They're expendable
[2:13:39] <%scifimisc> Chariots are tanky cavalry
[2:13:40] <%MaddyCaddy> It go vroom
[2:13:41] <+oda_flobunaga> BEN HUR
[2:13:41] <kazadaz> get in a battle and see what they do
[2:13:41] <+rowboat_girlyman> same thing
[2:13:42] <+eggstyr0ne> chariots for shock attack
[2:13:42] <Mister_McDerp> chariots are cav that you cycle charge
[2:13:43] <%SilvaChariot0133> A thing with wheels Kappa
[2:13:44] <Thewoodentree> IT THICC
[2:13:44] <@commanderclaw> Run them through the enemy, always keep them moving
[2:13:45] <%MaddyCaddy> Armor
[2:13:46] <@mothmandraws> chariot is beefier cav that ride through stuff
[2:13:46] <+eggstyr0ne> they are hammers
[2:13:47] <Firststrike_OW> Theyre hard hitting cav basically
[2:13:47] <%Piemono> Chariots are only really good for charing
[2:13:47] <Fien111> Better charge, worse in extended melee
[2:13:47] <BakerBrute> Less Units but they are heavier and better at charging
[2:13:49] <+ishouldfeelbad> Chariot has masss
[2:13:49] <%GohanHitsugaya> Wheels
[2:13:50] <klx5> chariots have weaker stats than cavalry usually but have a much better charge bonus
[2:13:50] <zamzoph> Chariots are cooler
[2:13:50] <%linkster291> Takes hits better.
[2:13:50] <derap41> Cavelery is horse chariots have a box behind it
[2:13:50] <+theKingRamses> chariots keep charging in to units
[2:13:51] <alwayspronking> chariots have good charge bonus but shit long fights
[2:13:53] <Wondabarrapa> Cycle charging
[2:13:53] <SilentEric> Chariots hit harder, but there are usually less of them.
[2:13:53] <%Punchasaur> seriously
[2:13:53] <$Caped_Eggy> Chariots are attach with wagons
[2:13:55] <+Skwizgarr> you use them for charging
[2:13:55] <kazadaz> Cavalry but heavier and shit in a long fight
[2:13:57] <%scifimisc> Yes
[2:13:58] <lloyddboy> chariots need lotsa micro
[2:13:58] <%arcanemacrocosm> chariot got bucket
[2:13:59] <derap41> Yeah
[2:13:59] <SGrim> Chariots have much better charg
[2:13:59] <+eggstyr0ne> yes
[2:14:00] <%Piemono> yeah
[2:14:00] <+rowboat_girlyman> yep
[2:14:00] <$thesickestzak> psaWrong
[2:14:01] <$Salty3acon> they have good weight
[2:14:01] <privatesargent> chariots are heavier so they are able to charge through the enemy
[2:14:02] <$correctedsun117> Ye
[2:14:02] <Fien111> cycle that shit
[2:14:03] <Onmi_Khaos> cavalry can remain stuck in a fight, chariot is for just going straight through
[2:14:03] <%MonsterEnvy> Tougher but weaker in a prolonged fight
[2:14:03] <+rowboat_girlyman> cycle-charging
[2:14:06] <Firststrike_OW> Yeah cycle charge em dont keep em in a fight
[2:14:06] <Mister_McDerp> micro intensive units
[2:14:06] <Dhurkst> IF YA KNOW WHAT I MEAN
[2:14:07] <kazadaz> in n out
[2:14:08] <SGrim> charge* rooDerp
[2:14:11] <alwayspronking> The lingo for that process is called "cycle charging" @PatStaresAt
[2:14:13] <vaderxyz1970> Cycle Charge
[2:14:13] <+ishouldfeelbad> yea, like shock cav but heavier
[2:14:13] <+oda_flobunaga> FLANKS ETC
[2:14:13] <$MemnonV> always pull out
[2:14:17] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt Cavalry are meant to charge and cycle charge, chariots are meant to charge and go THROUGH because they turn like shit
[2:14:18] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @PatStaresAt yup perfect for the hammer and the anvill
[2:14:22] <%bevyrage> vehicle versus steed units
[2:14:23] <+theKingRamses> that settlement is weak
[2:14:26] <%VashyronM> Grom is the only one who can stay in a fight and do well
[2:14:27] <VigilantShield> cav is one guy on a horse chariot is a wagon pulled by one or more horses or replacement and ridden by one or more guys
[2:14:30] <+AJ_Cherenkov> Chariots can force their way through units, but (normally), bad in combat. These aren't that bad, actually.
[2:14:32] <+eggstyr0ne> they have high mass and can move past enemies better then cav
[2:14:33] <derap41> That Propa Orky name
[2:14:38] <@commanderclaw> Boy is it
[2:14:41] <kazadaz> Smorbitz Badax has subbed for 31 months

[2:15:16] <@commanderclaw> Gamble is a reroll on starting magic
[2:15:17] <Mister_McDerp> don't gamble over 15
[2:15:19] <lloyddboy> GAMBLE
[2:15:19] <+oda_flobunaga> Steve Cavalry & Chad Chariots
[2:15:20] <OvaltineDream> What a great portrait, Grom
[2:15:22] <%scifimisc> Gamble takes a chance on getting you more magic or less to start
[2:15:23] <+eggstyr0ne> magic reasource

[2:15:23] <$Caped_Eggy> Mana, for magic casting

[2:15:40] <derap41> Check the spell on the troll ha
[2:15:48] <+rowboat_girlyman> troll lady is magic
[2:15:55] <gastherobots> @VashyronM Hey man, I remember Grail knights just fucking melting any large unit when they first came out. Getting stuck in and poking works really good.
[2:15:56] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt Press I for detailed unit info
[2:16:00] <@commanderclaw> River trolls stink so bad they make the enemy miss more often
[2:16:01] <@mothmandraws> id recomend putting your river trolls in middle of army
[2:16:04] <@mothmandraws> they have aoe debuff
[2:16:12] <+rowboat_girlyman> look at the troll models
[2:16:14] <Saltmeisterr> are we orkin it up?
[2:16:16] <+Rose_Silvers> thats not grom
[2:16:26] <OvaltineDream> We slumming with the gobbos
[2:16:32] <kazadaz> that's da fishy tiddlemuncha
[2:16:35] <%Valdorick> Useful Trolls!
[2:16:35] <kiso52> WAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH
[2:16:36] <derap41> Pat Trolls are more of an Augment than a stand alone unit they should be inside another unit
[2:16:40] <%MonsterEnvy> The Troll hag also has magic
[2:16:42] <Onmi_Khaos> So a general basic line is Gobbo's up front, Archers in the back, trolls and chariot's on the flank, lord and wizards with the Gobbo's
[2:16:43] <%GohanHitsugaya> LUL
[2:16:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> seems legit
[2:16:50] <KingVantq> Big ORBs
[2:16:51] <huskarl_zap> Does he know how to cycle charge and move in formation?
[2:16:55] <Sunstalker> Just like Smash players rooPog
[2:16:56] <%bluescreen1988> its paige!
[2:16:56] <%Valdorick> THAT'S REALLY GOOD VS LORDS
[2:17:00] <Thewoodentree> GRANDMA SWAMP!!!
[2:17:00] <%Shadowthedigger> She's fucking amazing.
[2:17:01] <%Piemono> Good for killing single units
[2:17:01] <Mister_McDerp> troll hag has titty physics
[2:17:01] <%Dfreddy8> Paige?
[2:17:01] <j0ustar> I'll believe that
[2:17:02] <gastherobots> Imagine the Nurgle debuffs.
[2:17:04] <@mothmandraws> spirit leach is for killing characters
[2:17:05] <twgrb06> No, @huskarl_zap , no he doesn't
[2:17:06] <%ryome> They are smellmos
[2:17:06] <@commanderclaw> Spirit leech is better the less number of dudes in a unit
[2:17:07] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt Spirit leech is a single target DPS spell, good for enemy characters
[2:17:08] <%Shadowthedigger> Swamp spit and death magic
[2:17:08] <%MonsterEnvy> Grom has a Charoit
[2:17:12] <%Left_Justified> My kinda lady Kreygasm

[2:17:40] <@SoFarFetched> you mean the WAAAAAAGHons
[2:17:42] <Zombrocom> Go WIDE
[2:17:44] <Mister_McDerp> turn on unit cards
[2:17:44] <derap41> Trolls should be inside smaller units to not fight alone
[2:17:47] <@mothmandraws> WE IZ GOBBOS
[2:17:48] <+rowboat_girlyman> WEZ GOBBOS
[2:17:53] <Zombrocom> WE ES GOBBOS
[2:17:54] <kiso52> WE IZ GOBBOS
[2:17:56] <%Valdorick> INFO
[2:18:00] <derap41> Trolls get scared easily
[2:18:01] <@mothmandraws> ye shows all info
[2:18:03] <+pistachio_the_nut> 5Head
[2:18:03] <Thewoodentree> DAT DATA
[2:18:04] <%Valdorick> Yes
[2:18:08] <Mister_McDerp> yep
[2:18:08] <huskarl_zap> hold alt +left click to move all units while staying in formation
[2:18:08] <derap41> Like that yea
[2:18:09] <+linSP> :o
[2:18:10] <%scifimisc> Yeah it helps both
[2:18:10] <Onmi_Khaos> No normal trolls get scared easily
[2:18:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> eww
[2:18:12] <+eggstyr0ne> yup
[2:18:13] <@mothmandraws> ye let the shitters eat the charge
[2:18:14] <+pistachio_the_nut> Yes, they can attack together
[2:18:14] <Pookiedaexzile> mmmmm
[2:18:15] <%Piemono> Yeah, they are harder to hit like that
[2:18:16] <%lastsonofodinn> lastsonofodinn subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 41 months! 
[2:18:17] <gunsrlove> Kreygasm
[2:18:18] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, they won't get focus fired that way
[2:18:18] <klx5> trolls have bad leadership so if they take sustained damage they run away
[2:18:18] <%SirGO0SE> hot
[2:18:18] <%Valdorick> They fight just as well, and don't have entiies gang up on them
[2:18:19] <+AJ_Cherenkov> Yeah, they don't defend too well, so the support will help
[2:18:19] <dipstere> @PatStaresAt if you hit ctrl+g your units will keep formation
[2:18:20] <kazadaz> yes, enemy units
[2:18:23] <klx5> put meatshields around them and they do work
[2:18:27] <%Aztec50> bubblewrap
[2:18:27] <+oda_flobunaga> IMPREGNATING THEM
[2:18:28] <+Rose_Silvers> @PatStaresAt you can hold alt and click and drag all your army in formation
[2:18:30] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt If you combine them like that the gobbos will protect the trolls flnaks
[2:18:31] <Mister_McDerp> you do that to lessen the damage they take
[2:18:33] <+theKingRamses> smaller units help clog anti-large units
[2:18:34] <+oda_flobunaga> Impregnating them
[2:18:41] <derap41> otherwise trolls gets swamped and scared away fast
[2:18:43] <alwayspronking> and lock them in that formation
[2:18:48] <+p4ntless> yup, they can push through the gobbos and attack but the gobbos will absorb hits and protect the trolls
[2:18:49] <%VashyronM> Just be careful, cause trolls move faster than goblins
[2:18:51] <@mothmandraws> makes them a little weaker to ranged shots but better in melee
[2:18:52] <%Punchasaur> middle is best for river trolls
[2:18:55] <%jetjagger222> that advantage meter
[2:18:55] <kazadaz> Press V to turn camera up a little
[2:18:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> take no prisoners
[2:19:01] <+AJ_Cherenkov> DLC trolls are better than most for morale, mind you
[2:19:03] <+scarman125> honestly the stone and river trolls are so much better than regular trolls they have WAY better staying power even on their own
[2:19:05] <huskarl_zap> good enough for now
[2:19:14] <%WhereIsWill> get em pat!
[2:19:14] <+ishouldfeelbad> they do alright with leadership, plus the debuffs
[2:19:18] <+p4ntless> works for quite a few monstrous infantry/shit garbage disposable unit combos
[2:19:21] <huskarl_zap> HOLD ALT THEN RIGHT CLICK THE ARMY TO CHARGE ALL
[2:19:22] <Zombrocom> Fuck em up
[2:19:23] <Monkeyweed21> put the wagons in their own group to flank
[2:19:26] <Thewoodentree> @mothmandraws Does he know how to order a formation attack?
[2:19:28] <@commanderclaw> Smash their green dicks
[2:19:29] <+rowboat_girlyman> use the pump wagons to flank and rear-charge
[2:19:33] <derap41> just focus on managein your chariot micro
[2:19:35] <%BubbaRands> Lahrge an' en chahrge!

[2:20:37] <%scifimisc> Right click an enemy unit
[2:20:38] <%Piemono> It's an attack
[2:20:39] <+Rose_Silvers> target an enemy
[2:20:39] <klx5> it targets enemies
[2:20:40] <kazadaz> They don't have a lord, so one unit is arbitrarily designated as a lord
[2:20:40] <VigilantShield> settlements t6hat don't have proper lords just have one of their guys assigned to beiing a lord
[2:20:41] <derap41> target an enemy

[2:31:12] <%Piemono> more recruit cost
[2:31:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> I have NO CHILLLL
[2:31:14] <Mister_McDerp> you have 2 recruitment towns
[2:31:15] <%maskedriderhero> all the boys gotta be in it together
[2:31:15] <+theKingRamses> more expensive but useful if you're in a hurry
[2:31:17] <%FusRoDom> DA BOYZ
[2:31:18] <Monkeyweed21> orc boyz local, gobbos global
[2:31:18] <Zombrocom> Recruit gobbos with global, get some pumps with local
[2:31:19] <Onmi_Khaos> him being the Goblin king means he's a Goblin who's king, not king of the Goblins!
[2:31:19] <Noctred192> more expensive
[2:31:20] <+rowboat_girlyman> 6 units in 1 turn
[2:31:21] <kazadaz> pump wagons also good
[2:31:21] <derap41> Its good
[2:31:22] <gastherobots> YEYE
[2:31:23] <+bugz_munny> mind blown
[2:31:25] <%juxtest> Keep in mind that Global costs more
[2:31:28] <huskarl_zap> Global is more exspensive though
[2:31:32] <+eggstyr0ne> but it cost more and takes longer
[2:31:32] <Onmi_Khaos> That's Skasnik you bitches
[2:31:32] <Monkeyweed21> Do gobbos global
[2:31:36] <GameOver_Here> Global can take longer
[2:31:37] <%Broand> hey pat watcha think of serious sam
[2:31:39] <Wondabarrapa> global is so fucking expensive
[2:31:39] <huskarl_zap> Globalist grom
[2:31:40] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> WAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHH
[2:31:43] <Onmi_Khaos> Except Gobbo's always take 1 turn
[2:31:49] <Zombrocom> 3?
[2:31:50] <%scifimisc> 3-4 is good
[2:31:51] <Monkeyweed21> Global is for gobbos
[2:31:51] <+rowboat_girlyman> 1 more
[2:31:52] <huskarl_zap> 3
[2:31:53] <$Slimshazbot> Global is stupid expensive and time consuming
[2:31:53] <%MonsterEnvy> 2 should be good
[2:31:53] <Mister_McDerp> only do the 1 turn global units tho
[2:31:54] <ryderbootz> Big Thinkin'
[2:31:55] <Onmi_Khaos> So 3 Gobbo Archers from Global and 3 Orc Boyz from Local
[2:31:55] <kazadaz> 18-19
[2:31:55] <%MelBrooksKA> I love that chat's being a bunch of back seaters and Mothman is just screaming "WAAAGH"!
[2:31:56] <klx5> I'd get 2 pump wagons 1 ork
[2:31:56] <EdictEngine> MANY
[2:31:56] <Sarcastastic> I'm so glad to see you really giving this game it's fair shake. Also, super excited to see more.
[2:31:57] <%Punchasaur> 69
[2:32:01] <huskarl_zap> only cav yoou got right now
[2:32:01] <derap41> Don't think you can manage more than 1
[2:32:01] <%Diana869> 3
[2:32:02] <%TaterBurglar> 3 is good
[2:32:02] <+Rose_Silvers> 4 is what i used
[2:32:05] <Zombrocom> You are going to need those pumps for the dwarfs down south
[2:32:05] <%jetjagger222> play it like khemri; all chariots, all the time
[2:32:05] <%THATGUY_789> is this Paunch Stares At. looks interesting
[2:32:07] <Monkeyweed21> 2 pumps 1 ork
[2:32:09] <%MonsterEnvy> 2 more I think
[2:32:10] <gastherobots> 2 or 3
[2:32:11] <JiggyWithIt74> Usually global is for recruiting stuff you don't have access to in the local region
[2:32:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Think wit ye ORb, WaahBoss
[2:32:14] <Mister_McDerp> don't do too many they're micro intensive @PatStaresAt
[2:32:14] <Onmi_Khaos> Depends, do you feel comfortable micro managing them?
[2:32:18] <+bugz_munny> would you say woooooosh 10 million?
[2:32:19] <huskarl_zap> get global boy
[2:32:22] <camelwizard> All these reveleatons are sweet
[2:32:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Think wit Ye ORB
[2:32:26] <+rowboat_girlyman> more wagons is more micro
[2:32:29] <%TaterBurglar> No stupid questions
[2:32:29] <+MisterBoneitis> Maybe some Boyz from the local , then gobbos from global?
[2:32:30] <Onmi_Khaos> Because if you don't, don't worry about them
[2:32:37] <gastherobots> Yes.
[2:32:37] <+eggstyr0ne> yeah
[2:32:38] <%scifimisc> Yes they do
[2:32:39] <%MonsterEnvy> Yes
[2:32:39] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt Yes
[2:32:39] <Onmi_Khaos> Yo
[2:32:39] <huskarl_zap> yes
[2:32:42] <derap41> Yeah but they can get in each other way
[2:32:42] <jackeroff3> depends
[2:32:43] <+theKingRamses> yes
[2:32:44] <Mister_McDerp> cavalry sandwiches are good
[2:32:44] <BakerBrute> Depends
[2:32:44] <Man_in_the_Red> it helps
[2:32:44] <klx5> they each get their individual charge bonuses
[2:32:44] <%TaterBurglar> Yes, individual charge values
[2:32:45] <$ItsRatman> Front and back? Yes
[2:32:46] <gastherobots> It is doubled, two charges.
[2:32:46] <%Piemono> both get charge bonus
[2:32:47] <alwayspronking> if you need that thing extra dead
[2:32:47] <huskarl_zap> it depends if they can fit
[2:32:47] <%MaddyCaddy> Not if they hit each other on the way
[2:32:48] <@mothmandraws> I think spread is better for mass moral damage
[2:32:48] <count_bob> Depends.
[2:32:50] <%SirPickelchips> can knock down more units
[2:32:51] <%jetjagger222> that's bretonnia 101
[2:32:53] <+oda_flobunaga> MORE CAVALRY MORE BETTERER
[2:32:53] <kazadaz> Depends. COncentrating makes it more likely the unit will insta-break
[2:32:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> Jill Sandwich them
[2:32:54] <Coltongrundy> you want to stagger them
[2:32:58] <Man_in_the_Red> if you can keep them going straight, all the better
[2:32:59] <+ccwettr123> they both get charge bonus, but you lose out on the moral malus from attacking the rear
[2:33:00] <Monkeyweed21> cavalry sandwiches
[2:33:01] <Onmi_Khaos> you can DP enemies with cavalry
[2:33:04] <%scifimisc> No
[2:33:04] <BakerBrute> The units have to make contact, so It could be rough with MANY cavaly, but a few should be fine
[2:33:04] <%wolfofsound> Cav wreck archers
[2:33:05] <Mister_McDerp> pincer attacking with cav is good
[2:33:08] <+theKingRamses> if you want to try and steamroll a unit for a morale hit
[2:33:08] <+eggstyr0ne> attacking multiple flanks is better
[2:33:08] <$correctedsun117> Pat, remember, this is almost more physics based than rules based
[2:33:10] <+ishouldfeelbad> there are penalties for being surrounded and overpowered
[2:33:10] <klx5> the pump wagons are really small unit numbers so they don't have that issue
[2:33:10] <Zombrocom> It's usually better spread out yeah
[2:33:11] <%scifimisc> Positioning is important
[2:33:13] <%MelBrooksKA> Thicc cavalry = bad?
[2:33:15] <derap41> no you do not want that
[2:33:15] <Monkeyweed21> cavalry want to do sandwiches
[2:33:15] <gastherobots> As long as their models can hit an enemy model.
[2:33:16] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> WAAAAAAGH
[2:33:17] <huskarl_zap> You dont want alot of units to bloch up anyway
[2:33:19] <alwayspronking> yeah, that's good advice. If they fit
[2:33:20] <gastherobots> And not get bunched up.
[2:33:21] <%Mr_Pylon> no you want to click, click, then boom
[2:33:21] <+Rose_Silvers> having your cav flank both sides is better
[2:33:21] <+oda_flobunaga> From each side and the back if possible
[2:33:23] <%SirGO0SE> haha cavalry go patoo
[2:33:27] <%MonsterEnvy> Also the difference between Chariots and Cav is that Chariots are tankier, but are not as good in a prolonged fight
[2:33:27] <+oda_flobunaga> lots of micro
[2:33:29] <%TaterBurglar> You can always do hammer/anvil, have the infantry hold them in place and the cav/chariots flank them for big damage
[2:33:32] <Onmi_Khaos> it's better for the team to spread out, but you can also use them as just this massive spear
[2:33:32] <ShichiNoBushi> Cntrl+A, Attack
[2:33:33] <Pookiedaexzile> This is how I imagine Real ORK meetings go
[2:33:38] <huskarl_zap> Make food
[2:33:39] <+eggstyr0ne> more archers instead
[2:33:40] <Zombrocom> Woo
[2:33:43] <%wolfofsound> GET HUGE
[2:33:43] <huskarl_zap> MAKE FOOD
[2:33:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> Big orb with big army
[2:33:45] <Pookiedaexzile> random screams with little info passed
[2:33:45] <%GohanHitsugaya> Waaagh! psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:33:46] <Heyestus> You want cav to hit from naked sides of enemy formations @PatStaresAt
[2:33:47] <+theKingRamses> big army
[2:33:47] <Mister_McDerp> archer spam yo
[2:33:50] <Onmi_Khaos> THE PAUNCH
[2:33:54] <@mothmandraws> greenskins and undead can max armies super fast
[2:33:58] <huskarl_zap> four is enough
[2:33:58] <%SirPickelchips> archers usually perform better than infantry
[2:34:02] <%maskedriderhero> make sure to get some boys later then, the boys wanna get some FOITIN
[2:34:04] <Zombrocom> Archers are insane once they get explosive arrows
[2:34:09] <derap41> They're kinda crap archers tho
[2:34:11] <%jetjagger222> VLAD INTENSIFIES
[2:34:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Boyz
[2:34:14] <+rowboat_girlyman> FOOD
[2:34:14] <huskarl_zap> MAKE FOOD
[2:34:15] <lilredmage> When looking up more lore for the warhammer series, I stumbled upon a theory that believes the movie Event Horizon is somehow a prequel to 40K. What a time to be alive
[2:34:16] <%Punchasaur> but ork
[2:34:16] <%juxtest> Does Grom have an upkeep penalty for Orc units?
[2:34:18] <derap41> So fast
[2:34:20] <%MonsterEnvy> Good turn one
[2:34:25] <Onmi_Khaos> I always archer spam myself, but I also don't like charging in, I like sitting back and letting the enemy come into range of my artillery and then whoops, turns out there's more guns when they get in close!
[2:34:25] <derap41> that used to take like 5 minutes
[2:34:26] <huskarl_zap> MAKE FOOD!
[2:34:27] <gastherobots> @mothmandraws Undead is kind of broken honestly. I beat the forces of chaos with just a FUCKLOAD of skele bois.
[2:34:34] <Man_in_the_Red> they even got the Big WAGH that rummages the map for new units
[2:34:35] <Mister_McDerp> very strong start @PatStaresAt
[2:34:37] <JiggyWithIt74> daaaamn thats a fast end turn hahaha
[2:34:41] <huskarl_zap> OKAY FILL UP ON UNITS
[2:34:44] <%MonsterEnvy> Gong to get a super awesome items
[2:34:50] <seth45er> GROM DA PAUNCH!

[2:35:04] <%Piemono> You can't cook shit
[2:35:06] <huskarl_zap> OH HE CANT FOOD
[2:35:11] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Grom demands soup
[2:35:11] <+rowboat_girlyman> double troll meat?
[2:35:22] <@mothmandraws> troll meats back on the menu
[2:35:23] <%MonsterEnvy> Beat Archnos and you should get stuff
[2:35:27] <derap41> pat the Gear in the lower right corner
[2:35:30] <kazadaz> bullshit that Civ 6 doesn't have a cooking mechanic
[2:35:35] <huskarl_zap> @rowboat_girlyman damn it your supposed to be a genius primark
[2:35:40] <derap41> Gear in the lower right corner
[2:35:40] <%MaddyCaddy> What?
[2:35:42] <%scifimisc> What do you mean?
[2:35:45] <PROUD2beGINGER> Why can't we have some meat?
[2:35:53] <klx5> it'll only prompt you for settlement upgrades
[2:35:59] <twgrb06> the gear in bottom right allows you to change notifications
[2:36:00] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt You can turn those on with that gear in the bottom right
[2:36:01] <Man_in_the_Red> you turned off that notification
[2:36:01] <Tucker0603> @PatStaresAt not sure if you saw but i think you can rename the troll-hag
[2:36:01] <Mister_McDerp> you can set that
[2:36:02] <%Piemono> Oh you have to choose to prompt that
[2:36:02] <+rowboat_girlyman> that's what the gear wheel is for
[2:36:03] <%MaddyCaddy> I guess
[2:36:03] <%wolfofsound> @PatStaresAt it's up to you what you prioritize
[2:36:06] <%MonsterEnvy> It warns you, but won't stop you
[2:36:07] <+eggstyr0ne> yeah only main settle chains ask you if you want to upgrade
[2:36:07] <gastherobots> I think you can turn that on.
[2:36:09] <alwayspronking> if the main building can upgrade, it will
[2:36:10] <%thebonebard> what
[2:36:11] <derap41> There is an end turn report
[2:36:12] <huskarl_zap> get more boyz
[2:36:13] <dyslexsam> dyslexsam subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:36:15] <+theKingRamses> you can turn on a prompt for that maybe
[2:36:21] <%Retinolgaming> @PatStaresAt You can customize what alerts you get in that gear you were just in.
[2:36:23] <%QuadraticGravity> DA PAIGE
[2:36:24] <@mothmandraws> also pat buildings only need 1 per zone, so wont need growth in other areas
[2:36:24] <%Punchasaur> looks like meats back on the menu boyz
[2:36:26] <derap41> in the upper right corner you can get a report of the previous turn
[2:36:28] <huskarl_zap> DA PAIGE
[2:36:29] <%scifimisc> The little gear beside the end turn button
[2:36:29] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> dA FiShY
[2:36:30] <%TaterBurglar> I think you can make it a notification setting in the gear to the bottom right of the end turn button
[2:36:32] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:36:34] <%SirGO0SE> COWARD
[2:36:35] <+Rose_Silvers> bottom right there is a setting button next to end turn button, can cusomize there what you want end turn button to remind you

[2:37:07] <%juxtest> Thats a lot of Goblin archers
[2:37:07] <%maskedriderhero> GO KRUMP EM BOSS
[2:37:08] <Onmi_Khaos> My current strategy, for Empire, is using The Bordermen, Hellstorm Rocket Batteries and then Handgunners/Crossbowmen/Huntsmen depending. The battle starts, and oh look, it's grenade launchers right in your face. while the enemy is scrambling with the shock of explosions, oh look, the sky is now on fire. as the enemy fails to chase down dickheads on horses with grenade launchers, getting melted by rocket batteries, the ones who make it to the front line discover that, surprise, MORE GUNS!
[2:37:08] <%scifimisc> Krump sum gits
[2:37:13] <Mister_McDerp> attack before they can recruit
[2:37:15] <Zombrocom> Recruit more gobbos
[2:37:18] <+eggstyr0ne> GO KRUMP SUM GITS
[2:37:20] <gastherobots> GET THOSE SHOOTA -- I -- I MEAN ARCHAS

[2:37:23] <%maskedriderhero> recruit some boys
[2:37:23] <Monkeyweed21> more spears
[2:37:25] <+rowboat_girlyman> BOYZ
[2:37:26] <@SoFarFetched> Damn that's like a story
[2:37:27] <huskarl_zap> BOYZ
[2:37:27] <derap41> Orcs have large armies of shit
[2:37:33] <%juxtest> You want melee fighters
[2:37:33] <huskarl_zap> NEED MORE CQC INFANTRY
[2:37:34] <kazadaz> You can march into their land and make a raiding camp
[2:37:35] <+MisterBoneitis> Get some melee boyz I reckon
[2:37:35] <Pookiedaexzile> HURT EM UP GOOD MAKE EM FEEL IT
[2:37:35] <%MonsterEnvy> You can beat Arachnos now before they get more dudes too
[2:37:37] <%QuadraticGravity> Man these guys are cheap.
[2:37:44] <Monkeyweed21> TOO MANY ARCHERS
[2:37:45] <+dawsfloss> it's been awhile since we've seen the CUBE Pat aeyviThinking
[2:37:49] <huskarl_zap> EIGHT ARCHERS
[2:37:59] <%maskedriderhero> but...but the boys
[2:38:03] <%wolfofsound> blot out the sky
[2:38:03] <derap41> Pat shoudl play elfs with this many archers
[2:38:04] <%maskedriderhero> they want some foitan
[2:38:07] <+badbloodbear> keep the enemy army to lure the drawrfs out of their keep
[2:38:08] <Zombrocom> Boys will come
[2:38:09] <Pookiedaexzile> LESS DAKKA MORE CHOPPA
[2:38:09] <%QuadraticGravity> You've got seven archers and five melee boys
[2:38:10] <kazadaz> nothin wrong with big archer
[2:38:11] <+Lost_Zombie> Can't wait for pat to go bankrupt
[2:38:14] <huskarl_zap> I mean its fine if you watch if they're obstructed
[2:38:15] <+rowboat_girlyman> hows the WAAAGH bar doing?

[2:39:50] <%juxtest> Oh yeah this settlement doesn't have walls so its just a field battle
[2:39:50] <+rowboat_girlyman> CHOKEPOINTS
[2:39:50] <Zombrocom> Use your archers to focus fire the enemy trolls
[2:39:50] <Pookiedaexzile> NEEDS A LEARNIN IN WHOSE BOSS
[2:39:51] <%scifimisc> Choke points are good for the defender
[2:39:52] <TheBestBadIdea> I think gamble is bugged now

[2:39:55] <%maskedriderhero> CAUSE GREENSKINS FIGHT
[2:39:58] <Drigoooooo> It’s bugged
[2:40:03] <JiggyWithIt74> yeah I jeard gambling is bugged
[2:40:06] <Thewoodentree> PLUS AUTO RESOLVES ARE FUCKY IN TOTAL WAR GAMES
[2:40:11] <derap41> Having a shit ton of archers is actually pretty good for a chokepoint
[2:40:14] <bolero765> choke points are great with all these archers
[2:40:24] <%wolfofsound> yeah he's lucky with this terrain
[2:40:24] <koolkatdq> it's my birthday in an hour and 30 minutes
[2:40:35] <%MonsterEnvy> you just ungrouped them
[2:40:39] <%thebonebard> if you hold control and double click on a unit card it will select all of the same type of unit
[2:40:40] <%MonsterEnvy> They were in a group already
[2:40:41] <huskarl_zap> LOCK
[2:40:43] <huskarl_zap> lock

[2:40:52] <%dyslexsam> @koolkatdq happy early bday dude!
[2:40:52] <gastherobots> Remember that archers get a really big bonus from shooting in the flank if you feel brave enough to maneuver them.
[2:40:53] <%spiritofmojave> @koolkatdq happy early birthday! LuvPeekL
[2:40:55] <+rowboat_girlyman> charge the pump wagons through
[2:40:59] <kazadaz> Often the AI will only defend 1 of the chokepoints
[2:41:03] <+rowboat_girlyman> cause chaos
[2:41:08] <koolkatdq> thanks
[2:41:09] <%juxtest> Hes got the high ground too, those Orcs over there are screwed
[2:41:10] <Tucker0603> should the trolls be with the infantry?
[2:41:10] <huskarl_zap> should archers stay in skirmish?
[2:41:13] <%maskedriderhero> ERE WE GO ERE WE GO
[2:41:17] <huskarl_zap> They'll run away
[2:41:24] <%Dfreddy8> Dats alot of BOYZ
[2:41:34] <Pookiedaexzile> Paige sounds ready to fuck some shit up
[2:41:34] <derap41> This chokepoint is in the AIs advantage but you have more ranged so you should be able to force them
[2:41:35] <%scifimisc> Skirmish is more annoying than it is helpful
[2:41:36] <+rowboat_girlyman> unlock
[2:41:38] <%wolfofsound> @huskarl_zap only if the enemy pushes in
[2:41:39] <Mister_McDerp> its cause theyre locked
[2:41:40] <huskarl_zap> relock
[2:41:46] <%wolfofsound> I always turn skirmish off tho
[2:41:50] <%spiritofmojave> @pookiedaexzile ain't she always LUL
[2:41:51] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt That's what locking a group does
[2:41:57] <JiggyWithIt74> You dont see enemy placment until the battle starts
[2:42:08] <ZhaoMura> lunpekWave
[2:42:09] <%juxtest> Haha embedded Trolls
[2:42:17] <twgrb06> Locking a group locks them relative to themselves, not to other groups
[2:42:18] <alwayspronking> Clap am so proud
[2:42:21] <+rowboat_girlyman> he's gettin it lads
[2:42:23] <Mister_McDerp> learning!

[2:42:41] <Tucker0603> ER WE GO ER WE GO ER WE GO
[2:42:41] <%WhereIsWill> mannn this looks so damn stressful
[2:42:42] <derap41> Ok you have to force them into the chokepoint with your ranged
[2:42:43] <%scifimisc> You can hold the chokepoints yourself, you can wait for them to come to you, or you can send the wagons in and charge
[2:42:44] <%wolfofsound> YUP
[2:42:44] <OvaltineDream> Fight in the shade, Bossman Pat
[2:42:49] <kazadaz> no you don't
[2:42:50] <%wolfofsound> Plug those gaps
[2:42:52] <+rowboat_girlyman> focus on one chokepoint
[2:42:52] <kazadaz> they don't have arty
[2:42:55] <gastherobots> You have more archers.
[2:42:58] <camelwizard> Hell yeah Pat, you're doing great
[2:43:04] <+rowboat_girlyman> use archers to whittle them down
[2:43:06] <Zombrocom> You have the ranged advantage, you can force them to come to you
[2:43:08] <ZhaoMura> Battle starts: Instant Retreat LUL
[2:43:08] <gastherobots> You can kill theirs and then force them to either get pelted to death or come to you.
[2:43:13] <JiggyWithIt74> usually they don't charge you through the chokepoint
[2:43:14] <@mothmandraws> hit R to make them walk
[2:43:16] <chrishansen69_> Who this new legend of total war?
[2:43:16] <derap41> Those pump waggons are unlocked
[2:43:17] <twgrb06> Set their speed to walk at the beginning of battle
[2:43:17] <Thewoodentree> not locked
[2:43:18] <twgrb06> R
[2:43:19] <kazadaz> You've got ranged advantage; you can force them to come to you
[2:43:22] <Mister_McDerp> they'll get in formation when they arrive
[2:43:23] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> F
[2:43:25] <%juxtest> Stupid Snotlings, get with the program

[2:44:06] <gastherobots> HE WANT'S DA TO START DA FIGHTEN
[2:44:06] <+oda_flobunaga> Pat is a fast boy
[2:44:07] <derap41> He is moving at full speed the other are moving as fast as the slower units
[2:44:08] <+rowboat_girlyman> use archers to bait them into charging your frontlines
[2:44:08] <+Rose_Silvers> if you want them all to run at the same speed, you have to lock them all in one group
[2:44:14] <huskarl_zap> they might flank
[2:44:16] <%maskedriderhero> lead with the wagons, smash them lines up REEEEEAL tiny like, lots of easy to chew bits
[2:44:17] <JiggyWithIt74> GROMS GOT THAT NITROUS BUTTON
[2:44:18] <%SilvaChariot0133> they defending
[2:44:19] <+eggstyr0ne> nuke their trolls with all your archers
[2:44:19] <huskarl_zap> dem boyz is dum

[2:44:21] <+oda_flobunaga> Page is Slow
[2:44:23] <derap41> They are holding the choke point Pat
[2:44:26] <Mister_McDerp> defenders don't advance first
[2:44:26] <kazadaz> Shoot them and force them to come to you
[2:44:26] <+theKingRamses> pick off their units with gobbos then
[2:44:26] <Thewoodentree> THEY MIGHT WHEN THEYRE IN ARTILLERY RANGE
[2:44:28] <+eggstyr0ne> their troll are the biggest threat
[2:44:28] <Monkeyweed21> thats what defenders are supposed to do @PatStaresAt
[2:44:29] <%MonsterEnvy> You are the attacker they win if you don't beat them in an hour
[2:44:30] <chrishansen69_> Idle, best defense
[2:44:33] <Zombrocom> Shoot em up to make them come to you
[2:44:35] <%jamesvdv12> bait them with spells and range theyll move
[2:44:36] <count_bob> Would you move Pat?
[2:44:38] <Pookiedaexzile> @oda_flobunaga shes just disabled
[2:44:38] <twgrb06> Holding a chokepoint? That's not very Orky of them, now is it?
[2:44:39] <%THATGUY_789> it's a Trap
[2:44:46] <+rowboat_girlyman> timer at the top
[2:44:48] <@commanderclaw> 60 minutes, yeah
[2:44:49] <squirtkitten> no it counts as a draw
[2:44:50] <derap41> Pat you have to force them out of the choke point
[2:44:53] <VigilantShield> yeah attackers have a time limit
[2:44:54] <gastherobots> Pelt them with arrows and force them to attack you or die.
[2:44:56] <%wolfofsound> He just needs to get up close enough to get archers to rain down
[2:44:57] <Mister_McDerp> they're the defenders, its on you to attack them
[2:45:01] <squirtkitten> i waited out an attacking force once and it said i lost but lost nothing
[2:45:02] <+oda_flobunaga> I am talking about ingame Paige
[2:45:02] <GameOver_Here> Ive done the same before. Just sit and wait.
[2:45:03] <JiggyWithIt74> if you have artillery you can force them to come to you up on the high ground
[2:45:05] <@commanderclaw> Like Persona says, Take your Time
[2:45:10] <Onmi_Khaos> No it's a draw
[2:45:12] <kazadaz> I have never, ever seen the time run out in this game
[2:45:12] <gastherobots> Or just go all in because that's the ORKY WAY
[2:45:15] <+rowboat_girlyman> perfect
[2:45:18] <+oda_flobunaga> Take thy time
[2:45:18] <%jamesvdv12> I have never ran out the clock playing this total war game
[2:45:19] <squirtkitten> WAAAAAAAAAAAGH SMOrc NO WAITIN'
[2:45:21] <JiggyWithIt74> but defenders dont usually charge through
[2:45:23] <derap41> That is good
[2:45:30] <+Sendaar> Ive ran out the timer once, and that was just memeing

[2:45:46] <+R_BChe> nice
[2:45:47] <Pookiedaexzile> BOSS I HEARD ABOUT THIS BEFORE DEYS DOING A 300 hundread
[2:45:48] <%QuadraticGravity> I think you can shove those wagons right through the formation to break their shit
[2:45:49] <%wolfofsound> well he's covering flank

[2:46:13] <%SilvaChariot0133> They blinked
[2:46:15] <derap41> Pump wagons can hold that flank easily
[2:46:17] <+Kiaayo> still trying to make warhammer happen?
[2:46:17] <%QuadraticGravity> normal speed?
[2:46:25] <gastherobots> I think undead vs chaos are the some of the longest battles I've had.
[2:46:26] <%wolfofsound> lol they are going back
[2:46:27] <kazadaz> THEY'RE RETREATING ON THE LEFT
[2:46:28] <%MonsterEnvy> Pumps can for sure hold the flank
[2:46:29] <+rowboat_girlyman> unlock melee troops
[2:46:30] <RC_S3kshun8> Needs more Dakka
[2:46:32] <%Punchasaur> snailhammer
[2:46:38] <Zombrocom> Focus your archers on those trolls, get em dead quick
[2:46:40] <%maskedriderhero> THEYZE RUNNIN BOSS
[2:46:40] <chrishansen69_> This tactic has crazy talk all over it
[2:46:43] <Mister_McDerp> they're scared of grom
[2:46:43] <%wolfofsound> he could get those archers on the hill to the left and shoot at the flanks
[2:46:43] <%maskedriderhero> BUNCHA PANSY GITS

[2:46:54] <%juxtest> Thats an open flank
[2:46:54] <%scifimisc> You can send the wagons through the gap they just made
[2:46:56] <+rowboat_girlyman> *WAGONS
[2:47:00] <%MonsterEnvy> The enemy is all grouping up on one flank
[2:47:01] <Daxalog> Sounds like an Invader Zim character
[2:47:05] <%MonsterEnvy> You can send the wagons around
[2:47:09] <+eggstyr0ne> nuke them with all your archer fire
[2:47:13] <@mothmandraws> focus archers on trolls
[2:47:15] <+rowboat_girlyman> unlock archers

[2:47:36] <%Punchasaur> is that psychicpebbles as the lady troll
[2:47:36] <Zombrocom> Locked groups forces them to stay in that shape
[2:47:36] <+rowboat_girlyman> formation lock
[2:47:37] <gastherobots> It's a narrower space.
[2:47:39] <thwak> ah yes the classic total war mistake of misclicking movement on archers
[2:47:40] <%Nekros4442> Pat...

[2:48:24] <%jamesvdv12> @lwpabloelenano2hc I dont even know how thats possible u have basically have unlimited vortex nukes, what happens?
[2:48:25] <%MonsterEnvy> Don't forget to have your troll barf on them
[2:48:26] <Arisato_II> I dont like this
[2:48:26] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL LUL LUL
[2:48:28] <%KnivesEve> this is new, so how is pat doing?
[2:48:29] <tonfirean> So is the first campaign orcs because the devs know it'll be a big mess no matter what?
[2:48:30] <+eggstyr0ne> you can path a unit by holding shift and dragging a path for them
[2:48:32] <%maskedriderhero> fancy formations is for gits and pointy 'eads, we rush em up, smash em down, and eat whats left over
[2:48:36] <Mister_McDerp> weak frontline is not a good idea
[2:48:41] <Pookiedaexzile> WES GOTTA HOLD EM BOYS
[2:48:48] <%MonsterEnvy> Hold shift to make them go around areas
[2:48:52] <gastherobots> Archers are still going to do real good but the melee might be a clusterfuck. But I mean it is the Orks.
[2:48:53] <Pookiedaexzile> CAVI-RE is COMMIN
[2:48:56] <OvaltineDream> HOLD TEH CENTER GOBBOS
[2:48:57] <+Rose_Silvers> you can hold shift and drag right click to give a unit a trail to follow
[2:49:10] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @jamesvdv12 i fucked up and went there with half army 0 dinosaurs and tired units
[2:49:13] <%jamesvdv12> get some spells off my guy this is the time

[2:49:24] <Tucker0603> GO PAIGE
[2:49:25] <@mothmandraws> btw your hag is strong in combat so be aggressive
[2:49:28] <%thebonebard> @PatStaresAt if you click on a units, hold shift and drag your mouse with left click you can draw a pathway for your guys to take but it does take a bit of time to actually do the attack without doing it manually because they set themselves up
[2:49:29] <Zombrocom> Spam spirit leech on their lord
[2:49:30] <@commanderclaw> Trolls are cowards
[2:49:30] <+oda_flobunaga> Bring Paige into the fray
[2:49:40] <chrishansen69_> they hate rivers
[2:49:42] <%thebonebard> @PatStaresAt i mean right click
[2:49:43] <%Punchasaur> borked
[2:49:45] <%wolfofsound> @oda_flobunaga LUL
[2:49:46] <gastherobots> BTW what is everyone's opinion on the best learner faction? I'd have to go Vlad.
[2:49:46] <Mister_McDerp> BIG cowards
[2:49:48] <shamblerhero> Does Pat know he's playing in halfspeed LUL
[2:49:53] <%maskedriderhero> remember that Grom is a fat dude on a motor scooter, use him to run people over
[2:49:54] <Zombrocom> Trolls regen so they will be back
[2:49:56] <@commanderclaw> They regen though, so they might come back
[2:49:57] <%jamesvdv12> @lwpabloelenano2hc bruh thats a big goof
[2:50:00] <derap41> Paige has a good spell against their lord
[2:50:00] <JiggyWithIt74> they might come back
[2:50:02] <@mothmandraws> ye its his first time
[2:50:07] <%jetjagger222> @gastherobots dorfs or vamps
[2:50:07] <Thewoodentree> How bad is friendly fire in this?
[2:50:08] <@mothmandraws> the more you play the less you use half speed
[2:50:15] <%scifimisc> Really bad with explosives
[2:50:16] <bolero765> that flank is going to hurt them bad
[2:50:16] <%wolfofsound> @shamblerhero I think he does, it's very good to play like that for newer people
[2:50:16] <ihatemylifeitsux> @PatStaresAt your spell spirit leech is very good against other enemy heros and lords
[2:50:19] <NeroInfinite> DEM BIG GITS ARE COWARDS. SMOrc
[2:50:22] <Zombrocom> Pump wagons should focus infantry
[2:50:27] <chrishansen69_> This is like special needs mode
[2:50:28] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @jamesvdv12 yeah and i lost the fight anny way...then reloaded and went there with a propper army and won on 10 mins
[2:50:33] <Man_in_the_Red> friendly fire and spells are very likely to kill friends
[2:50:40] <@commanderclaw> She already puked, it's on cooldown
[2:50:41] <huskarl_zap> CA makes all games half speed so people stop bitching against being too fast
[2:50:44] <Man_in_the_Red> Artillery and spells*
[2:50:50] <JiggyWithIt74> yeah she had to get closer to activate spells
[2:50:56] <derap41> Its a good 1st level spell
[2:50:58] <+oda_flobunaga> Oh no Paige is being sick all over the enemy army
[2:50:59] <%juxtest> Pats Goblins are really holding up
[2:51:03] <shamblerhero> I never once touched half-speed when I was new. My potato computer was slow enough LUL
[2:51:09] <JiggyWithIt74> thats why when you clicked it, the arrow was red
[2:51:17] <huskarl_zap> Paige is throwing her clostomy bag at those peepol
[2:51:21] <Onmi_Khaos> Slam the goblin's into the side, crack those flanks!
[2:51:21] <Zombrocom> RUN OVER THOSE SHITTY ARCHERS YEYEYE
[2:51:24] <derap41> @juxtest its because the trolls are helping
[2:51:28] <Pookiedaexzile> FOR BOY VEINS
[2:51:28] <dinnydanny777> War, war never changes
[2:51:28] <chrishansen69_> Paige is good at draining morale
[2:51:32] <gastherobots> This actually turned out really good. Nice.
[2:51:32] <%wolfofsound> @PatStaresAt some of your guys are chasing north
[2:51:41] <@commanderclaw> Ar arrerz will blot out da sun!
[2:51:44] <huskarl_zap> Spirit leech is a Paige ability IRL
[2:51:45] <derap41> Got em in a pincer now
[2:51:49] <OvaltineDream> Paige pukes poison onto enemy generals for the waaagh
[2:51:50] <%QuadraticGravity> Up left
[2:51:55] <Mister_McDerp> troll hags can handle melee pretty well for casters

[2:52:49] <chrishansen69_> It will knock you out
[2:52:50] <+Rose_Silvers> i think pat might like dwarves, they are very defensive faction, letting the enemy come to them
[2:52:51] <Monkeyweed21> Why are my troops doing exactly what I told them to, what are they stupid?
[2:52:53] <%SirPickelchips> elces are the bestest

[2:53:00] <Zombrocom> Elves got dragons though that's cool
[2:53:07] <+rowboat_girlyman> unlock them
[2:53:10] <Mister_McDerp> unlock the archers
[2:53:11] <%wolfofsound> does he have fire at will on?
[2:53:13] <derap41> fyi chariots and cav should not be on guard mode since they should be running down enemies
[2:53:13] <Zombrocom> Unlock your archers its fucking with their movement
[2:53:21] <$Slimshazbot> Pat would get on well with dwarves. They're tiny, spiteful, and murderous. Pat's most of those things
[2:53:21] <ShichiNoBushi> Shoot-twangs.
[2:53:22] <Onmi_Khaos> Turn off the lock on the archers Pat
[2:53:25] <+pistachio_the_nut> Malekith the Eternity King 4EVER BABY
[2:53:28] <%jamesvdv12> use the chariot units to hit the rear of his flank pull in and out it will fuck with their leadership

[2:54:57] <%PerrinIsDead> Shit pc
[2:54:59] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt The formation lock was kinda fucking with your archers there, maybe turn it off once they start shooting?
[2:55:00] <JiggyWithIt74> it's a settlement battle so no need to chase them down to whittle down their numbers
[2:55:01] <KNWatcher> work work. job complete
[2:55:02] <+oda_flobunaga> Are there naval battles in this ?
[2:55:03] <Man_in_the_Red> @FirearmsInstructor Total Warhammer its about total war, and warhammer
[2:55:03] <%Axellogic> So I assume this means Pat has figured things out
[2:55:03] <Roach3s> RAT GANG SKAVEN ON TOP RAT GANG
[2:55:04] <Pookiedaexzile> WEz DA BIGGEST
[2:55:07] <derap41> Doesn't give XP
[2:55:08] <JiggyWithIt74> they all auto die
[2:55:08] <huskarl_zap> not needed in settlement battles
[2:55:10] <@mothmandraws> ye its best to keep going if you need to kill a hero
[2:55:11] <apupupu> u dont want to kill em u confederate and steal units
[2:55:11] <Onmi_Khaos> More. Corpses.
[2:55:13] <+rowboat_girlyman> Aim for the lord when you do run them down
[2:55:13] <%TrafficCohen> Don't do that
[2:55:14] <+eggstyr0ne> if its a settlement battle you kill all their troops
[2:55:15] <KingVantq> 2080 too weak for Rats
[2:55:15] <%Aydarkzero> doesn't Pat do a single stream setup?
[2:55:17] <%FallenAngelZelos> Having more fun this time, Pat?
[2:55:18] <%TrafficCohen> Confederate
[2:55:18] <Roach3s> Annihilated LUL
[2:55:18] <gastherobots> Another good use for cav, running down routed units and lords.
[2:55:19] <Mister_McDerp> running them down doesn't matter in settlement battles @PatStaresAt
[2:55:19] <derap41> Its a settlement so they couldn't run
[2:55:19] <%PerrinIsDead> Jk pat
[2:55:20] <+Skwizgarr> was a seige
[2:55:20] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[2:55:21] <%wolfofsound> @PatStaresAt it's what cav is really good at killing them off,
[2:55:21] <%SirPickelchips> they all die anyway when you attack a settlement
[2:55:21] <%scifimisc> All enemies die if you win a settlement battle
[2:55:22] <klx5> if defenders lose a settlement battle they're done
[2:55:22] <%xcompleasedad> EAT DEIR BODIEZ
[2:55:24] <%Ner234> DED
[2:55:24] <+theKingRamses> worth killing extra enemies if you want to make sure an expensive unit dies

[2:55:28] <chrishansen69_> Pat never meant to kill them
[2:55:29] <kazadaz> Siege defense, if they lose they all die
[2:55:29] <+Sendaar> If you win a siege all defenders die
[2:55:33] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Dem gits had it comin'
[2:55:34] <Onmi_Khaos> Yeah they were in a city
[2:55:35] <%thebonebard> yea you kill them all if they are in a settlement i believe
[2:55:35] <BabyNaBackbrace> Hearing Ork voices always makes me talk like them
[2:55:37] <Onmi_Khaos> It's victory or death in a city
[2:55:38] <Arisato_II> People die
[2:55:41] <%jamesvdv12> yeah dont keep the battle going if u are taking a settlement bc they all die automatically
[2:55:41] <+MisterBoneitis> Grom got 157 kills holy shit
[2:55:42] <shamblerhero> It's a seige so they all die anyway

[3:06:32] <%jamesvdv12> just get one batterin ram and tower
[3:06:34] <%maskedriderhero> jsut smack em
[3:06:34] <%ckangaroo15k> Seiges suck
[3:06:36] <%scifimisc> You can besiege them and they might come out to attack you
[3:06:37] <%maskedriderhero> smack em hard
[3:06:38] <alwayspronking> build towers and 1 ram
[3:06:39] <Mister_McDerp> dwarves overperform in autoresolve
[3:06:39] <derap41> First Propa fight its not unwinnable
[3:06:40] <+rowboat_girlyman> just wait 9 turns
[3:06:40] <+gruff_gridof> you should run
[3:06:41] <gastherobots> Dwarf sieges are the fucking worst. You can do it, but they're assholes.
[3:06:42] <%MaddyCaddy> Starve them out
[3:06:42] <+gutlesscoward> towers and rams
[3:06:42] <+unstableshiba> auto resolve is skewed for dwarves, you arent that disadvantaged
[3:06:43] <%Retinolgaming> Towers and rams
[3:06:43] <%Binary_Fireball> DONT
[3:06:44] <%jamesvdv12> thats all u need
[3:06:45] <%Nekros4442> Stave em out
[3:06:45] <Man_in_the_Red> hey man, you gotta practice for that sick ass final battle
[3:06:47] <copyritetm> I just tried it and I'm new too and it was fine
[3:06:47] <$Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt You want more anti-armor for dorfs
[3:06:47] <derap41> You also have that Mork Statueu
[3:06:48] <+oda_flobunaga> Maintain the siege for a few turns
[3:06:49] <+Rose_Silvers> if you wait 9 turns, they will run out of food
[3:06:49] <Monkeyweed21> starve them out
[3:06:49] <%Binary_Fireball> DONT DO IT PAT
[3:06:49] <kazadaz> Build towers, hope for them to attack you
[3:06:50] <huskarl_zap> Yeah build rams
[3:06:50] <%NWR_James> LAY SIEGE
[3:06:51] <Essixian> What?! What is this?! You're playing TW2?`! What?!
[3:06:51] <%SirPickelchips> id pull back and try to ambush their army
[3:06:52] <NeroInfinite> GOOD LUCK PAT LUL
[3:06:54] <$ItsRatman> if it were me i would lame it out, but you have a stream to do
[3:06:55] <Soginha> Mantain the siege
[3:06:56] <%jetjagger222> if you assault this it will be painful
[3:06:56] <%Auctorian> WAAAAAAAGHHHH!
[3:06:57] <@mothmandraws> rock golem will break open door ez
[3:06:57] <%MaddyCaddy> 14 turns to starve them
[3:06:57] <%bevyrage> YOU DO NOT NEED TOWERS OR RAMS
[3:06:59] <+MisterBoneitis> Keep the siege up till they attack you
[3:06:59] <Ks201> So what do the weved red and yellow line mean?
[3:06:59] <JiggyWithIt74> Yeah it's their walls that give them the advantage
[3:07:00] <+Sendaar> Towers >>> Rams imo
[3:07:01] <%thebonebard> i think you will die get a second lord or better units
[3:07:04] <huskarl_zap> This is winnable
[3:07:05] <kazadaz> trolls and wagons are anti-armour
[3:07:06] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt Bash down the gates with your trolls and rush the victory point it's fine. Pump wagons and trolls are anti armour
[3:07:06] <%scifimisc> The new item you got will help a lot
[3:07:06] <+unstableshiba> your trolls can bust down the gate
[3:07:07] <Heyestus> that's why you want more
[3:07:07] <Monkeyweed21> just strave em out
[3:07:09] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> he cant starve them out eleves coming too
[3:07:11] <Mister_McDerp> its fine, dwarves get bullshit autoresolve
[3:07:12] <zamzoph> Good luck, I'm behind seven walls
[3:07:12] <derap41> Charge the gate with trolls and
[3:07:13] <JiggyWithIt74> continue the siege by building stuff, theymight go out and attack you
[3:07:13] <+rowboat_girlyman> starve them out
[3:07:13] <$Slimshazbot> @PatStaresAt Get pump wagons with spiky rollas, armor piercing AND armor sundering
[3:07:16] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> You have regen for 15 turns, Attacking something is a good way to use it
[3:07:16] <+oda_flobunaga> starve them out
[3:07:17] <huskarl_zap> Just siege untill their numbers go down
[3:07:17] <+eggstyr0ne> you can attack right away by having the trolls attack the gates
[3:07:20] <%Binary_Fireball> this is bad idea
[3:07:21] <%juxtest> The wagons and trolls can smash the gates and let the goblins in
[3:07:22] <Man_in_the_Red> you can zerg rush the gates, assuming the AI doesnt open it for you
[3:07:24] <%bevyrage> towers and rams are slow and easy to get destroyed, while your units inside the towers will DIE FOR FREE
[3:07:24] <Soginha> if you wait 8 turns they die of atrition
[3:07:25] <Onmi_Khaos> So, you can besiege them, and while they're unable to build up their troops, recruit a second lord and start building up his troops
[3:07:25] <+eggstyr0ne> but building towers is good
[3:07:25] <+oda_flobunaga> the longer yuo siege, the weaker they get
[3:07:26] <apupupu> they will sully out next turn
[3:07:27] <gastherobots> Think they might sally forth at this ratio?
[3:07:31] <KNWatcher> risky fight
[3:07:34] <%jamesvdv12> its not fully necessary but they are some armored lads
[3:07:35] <%Punchasaur> this fight is literally pat vs pat
[3:07:35] <GameOver_Here> IT's okay to lose
[3:07:36] <bolero765> rogue idol isn't accounted for in autoresolve + you got the save if it goes pear shaped
[3:07:38] <derap41> Grom and the trolls can attack the gate and you can fire a shit ton of arrows
[3:07:38] <+unstableshiba> @PatStaresAt Dwarves get autoresolve bonuses, you arent that behind
[3:07:40] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> @PatStaresAt you cant wait the turns elves are coming
[3:07:41] <@mothmandraws> tough fight but is dooable
[3:07:42] <%scifimisc> The item you gave the hag will crush the walls
[3:07:43] <huskarl_zap> can you make scrap arrows
[3:07:44] <%MaddyCaddy> They might attack you too if you end turn
[3:07:44] <+rowboat_girlyman> you only need to wait 9 turns before they start dying of starvation
[3:07:45] <%Binary_Fireball> It's better to know when you would lose
[3:07:45] <Mister_McDerp> you could just keep them under siege
[3:07:47] <+scarman125> @PatStaresAt you can try to set up an ambush and trick them out of their fort
[3:07:47] <%Binary_Fireball> and not fight
[3:07:47] <kazadaz> Pat's brain vs pat's body
[3:07:51] <%MaddyCaddy> So you don't have to siege battle
[3:07:51] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> siege a bit
[3:07:52] <%Binary_Fireball> YOU DONT NEED TO FIGHT
[3:07:53] <privatesargent> you can always retreat, and set up and ambush to bait the dwarfs out
[3:07:54] <Riccto> get nasty skulkers
[3:07:57] <huskarl_zap> The balance bar is wrong
[3:07:58] <+Rolandknight> just bulid towers and get another army
[3:07:59] <SGrim> Another one
[3:08:00] <tactician0> Hitt em hard hit em bigga
[3:08:00] <%SirGO0SE> PogChamp
[3:08:03] <%Shadowthedigger> Build towers
[3:08:03] <bolero765> SMOrc SMOrc SMOrc
[3:08:06] <NeroInfinite> You trolls are anti armor you'll be fine
[3:08:06] <%jamesvdv12> just make sure u have a tower otherwose they will get a fuck ton of penalties to their endurance
[3:08:06] <%Shadowthedigger> Neglect rams
[3:08:07] <huskarl_zap> Its like 60% your favor
[3:08:10] <%Binary_Fireball> NEVER FIGHT A FAIR FIGHT
[3:08:10] <+rowboat_girlyman> the one next to it
[3:08:13] <apupupu> if u stay they will fiight u in the open
[3:08:14] <%jamesvdv12> one tower one ram
[3:08:16] <Mister_McDerp> build some towers if you wait
[3:08:17] <+unstableshiba> @PatStaresAt your trolls and grom can also bust down the gates, you dont need a ram
[3:08:18] <GameOver_Here> Build a siege engine then continue siege
[3:08:18] <%jetjagger222> towers; you will get the shit shot out of you by dorfs
[3:08:19] <+eggstyr0ne> you dont need rams
[3:08:20] <%thebonebard> @mothmandraws is it dooable for him though psaSkelmo psaSkelmo
[3:08:20] <+rowboat_girlyman> just make towers
[3:08:22] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> ye
[3:08:23] <+Rolandknight> yeah
[3:08:23] <alwayspronking> yes!

[3:08:25] <bolero765> yes
[3:08:26] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> ye
[3:08:27] <derap41> You could put goblins in towers but the gate will break before they reach the wall
[3:08:27] <%scifimisc> No rams, yes towers
[3:08:28] <apupupu> stay for a turn to build
[3:08:29] <+rowboat_girlyman> towers yes, rams no
[3:08:30] <+Functional_Platypus> Towers and a ram
[3:08:31] <%jamesvdv12> just one
[3:08:32] <kazadaz> towers for your gobbos, trolls go through the doors
[3:08:32] <%juxtest> No rams the trolls are a ram
[3:08:33] <Thewoodentree> YOULL WANT TO FIGHT THEM ON AS MANY FRONTS AS POSSIBLE
[3:08:33] <gastherobots> Build stuff, also the might come out to fight you while you build which would be great.
[3:08:34] <+oda_flobunaga> TOWERS FOR THE BLOOD GOD
[3:08:35] <+rowboat_girlyman> 4

[3:08:38] <Mister_McDerp> as many as you want
[3:08:38] <%DEETRz> 2
[3:08:38] <%jetjagger222> dwarfs have lots of GUN
[3:08:39] <Monkeyweed21> all towers
[3:08:39] <+scarman125> 2

[3:08:45] <$MemnonV> no tower
[3:08:45] <huskarl_zap> it only depends if someone else comes
[3:08:46] <GameOver_Here> 2-4
[3:08:47] <derap41> Never make a ram rams are pointless
[3:08:48] <+MisterBoneitis> Build a couple towers, then continue the siege
[3:08:48] <+oda_flobunaga> All the towers
[3:08:50] <Mister_McDerp> rams suck\
[3:08:51] <%Dfreddy8> All of them

[3:09:11] <kazadaz> Only cost is time
[3:09:11] <derap41> its siege money not real money
[3:09:11] <privatesargent> its free but it takes turns to make
[3:09:14] <apupupu> numbers = turns
[3:09:15] <@mothmandraws> doesnt need trolls just needs rogue idol to mess the walls up
[3:09:18] <GameOver_Here> Thats 5 turns
[3:09:19] <Mr_Rakjo> He doesnt need Rams he has the summoned golem of the hag
[3:09:19] <Man_in_the_Red> i mean, it cost time to build
[3:09:19] <+Sendaar> You must construct additional pylons
[3:09:20] <+scarman125> @PatStaresAt each one is 2 towers so don't over do it
[3:09:21] <%jamesvdv12> they be super tired if u scale the wall without towers and theyll get wrecked

[3:10:20] <%TaterBurglar> It's no big deal, your trolls can knock down the gates really easily. You really don't need the rams or towers
[3:10:21] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt you really don't need towers

[3:10:57] <TheMorilo> IT'S SUPER CLEAR
[3:10:59] <Heyestus> Yeah the turn timers under the siege equipment are real obfuscating.
[3:11:01] <Onmi_Khaos> For fucks sakes Chat stop triggering the man
[3:11:04] <+Rolandknight> no your just not look at everything.
[3:11:05] <Mister_McDerp> you have to hit maintain siege
[3:11:06] <+rowboat_girlyman> not attack until the towwers are built
[3:11:07] <derap41> You spend time building the siege stuff
[3:11:07] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> you didnt build them
[3:11:08] <gastherobots> Because they need to be built like units.
[3:11:09] <%Binary_Fireball> You good Pat
[3:11:09] <huskarl_zap> this isnt medievil
[3:11:11] <@SoFarFetched> Let's calm down now chat LUL
[3:11:12] <gastherobots> Like how some units take two turns
[3:11:13] <%Dfreddy8> Poor Pat
[3:11:14] <$correctedsun117> Building seige equipment takes time
[3:11:18] <%thebonebard> you attack when the towers are built
[3:11:18] <Monkeyweed21> Sieges take time cumbo
[3:11:21] <%scifimisc> You told your gobbos to build towers, you didnt actually let them do it
[3:11:22] <%Punchasaur> @DesuDesuDokiDoki bro its BREATHE
[3:11:23] <%StaceMcGate> You do not have to build towers, don't worry. They are there only if you need them
[3:11:24] <kazadaz> If you don't have arty, then sieges take a few turns to pull off
[3:11:28] <$MemnonV> you can win without siege things
[3:11:30] <%Nekros4442> You have to actually build them first like actual units.
[3:11:34] <Thewoodentree> Yeah Pat never yells at anyone for doing something wrong
[3:11:34] <%jamesvdv12> build a ram too
[3:11:34] <$correctedsun117> HOORAY
[3:11:35] <%Binary_Fireball> yup
[3:11:37] <%Binary_Fireball> :D
[3:11:40] <derap41> and wait 3 turns
[3:11:41] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> very good
[3:11:43] <DXLelouch24> Just like rl building take time to build,who knew?
[3:11:43] <gastherobots> Ye
[3:11:44] <+the_arthman> all infantry have ladders in their back pockets, I wouldn't waste the time
[3:11:44] <%SilvaChariot0133> yup
[3:11:44] <+rowboat_girlyman> the number under the towers shows how long it is until they've been built
[3:11:45] <$correctedsun117> yes
[3:11:46] <derap41> yup
[3:11:47] <%jamesvdv12> end the turn
[3:11:52] <@mothmandraws> wait or build 2nd army if you can afford it
[3:11:53] <%thebonebard> maybe make a second lord for backup
[3:11:54] <+oda_flobunaga> yarp
[3:11:55] <%scifimisc> Yes
[3:11:56] <derap41> What menu?
[3:11:57] <Mister_McDerp> they can't recruit or build while under siege @PatStaresAt
[3:11:59] <%terminallyCapriciousz> man this chat makes this game sound like the most unfun game ever made
[3:12:01] <twgrb06> Make a second lord
[3:12:02] <illicitdonut> Is pat playing as his avatar, tha Paunch?
[3:12:03] <+MisterBoneitis> Yeah, wait a couple turns
[3:12:04] <+eggstyr0ne> you can hire a lord to get to the hag merchant
[3:12:14] <%jamesvdv12> which menu?
[3:12:15] <Onmi_Khaos> I would raise another lord and start building a second army
[3:12:17] <%StaceMcGate> You do not need towers if you have trolls or artillery, just rush dem fuckers
[3:12:17] <derap41> You can look at a list of cities in the top right corner
[3:12:18] <@mothmandraws> you have 3 options
[3:12:18] <KNWatcher> good move
[3:12:19] <gastherobots> Second army time?
[3:12:20] <%thebonebard> can he teleport to the merchant
[3:12:23] <OvaltineDream> Or jsut send paige back to her
[3:12:23] <+rowboat_girlyman> save money
[3:12:26] <huskarl_zap> Hold me closa tiney dancer

[3:12:33] <+oda_flobunaga> @illicitdonut yes and he brought Paige along for the ride
[3:12:36] <derap41> Bad idea with your current income
[3:12:37] <%ryome> Hire a lord, sillybilly
[3:12:37] <gastherobots> War boss would be a good backup to fight the Dwarfs.
[3:12:39] <%scifimisc> You can hire the lord to talk to the tussy, then disband him after
[3:12:40] <%jamesvdv12> yeah u dont have enough rev for another army
[3:12:48] <%jamesvdv12> this siege will help tho
[3:12:48] <illicitdonut> @oda_flobunaga noice
[3:12:54] <Heyestus> Whenever I catch sight of the URL for this stream all I see is PastaReset
[3:12:56] <%thebonebard> still a second lord wouldnt hurt
[3:12:59] <apupupu> upgrade ur goblins wih scraps so they get ap damage

[3:13:21] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Excellent
[3:13:26] <huskarl_zap> forgget it
[3:13:26] <%Binary_Fireball> You can recruit an army to burn for the siege. They'll mostly die in the siege so you wont be stuck paying for them after
[3:13:30] <derap41> Look at the beast them they're trying
[3:13:32] <huskarl_zap> forget it for now

[3:18:21] <Onmi_Khaos> It's fine, they stack
[3:18:22] <derap41> @mothmandraws You should always stack growth on your main province to get that high level gear early
[3:18:22] <gastherobots> @StaceMcGate They're still useful to avoid the arty.
[3:18:23] <Onmi_Khaos> Shut up chat

[3:18:51] <Thewoodentree> growth is regional not city based
[3:18:52] <kazadaz> Growth stacks across the whole province
[3:18:53] <%BeatH7> @PatStaresAt they mean that it's fine to build more growth buildingss because the growth stacks,, those cities are part of the same region
[3:18:53] <%scifimisc> All growth buildings affect everything in the area
[3:18:53] <JackalKing> Growth applies across the entire province.
[3:18:54] <derap41> You should

[3:25:11] <derap41> Choose a gate and storm it
[3:25:12] <stormydaysz> god this game has such a UI overload
[3:25:13] <Thewoodentree> Why did the seige equipment stay if he left the seig?
[3:25:22] <%NWR_James> Each tower is 1 unit. A unit has 2
[3:25:23] <+eggstyr0ne> use your trolls to smash the gates
[3:25:23] <+rowboat_girlyman> focus on one part of the wall
[3:25:25] <Onmi_Khaos> he didn't leave the siege he continued the siege
[3:25:25] <Mister_McDerp> right click wall with the siege towers selected
[3:25:29] <+rowboat_girlyman> don't spead your forces out
[3:25:33] <huskarl_zap> ALL ON THE LEDT SIDE
[3:25:34] <apupupu> go down middle
[3:25:34] <Man_in_the_Red> zerg rush one gate
[3:25:36] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> left
[3:25:37] <@mothmandraws> overwhelm one side
[3:25:38] <kazadaz> stack up all your siege towers on the left side
[3:25:39] <Monkeyweed21> focus on 1 gate
[3:25:39] <%SirGO0SE> how the hell did they get those lights up wow
[3:25:40] <NeroInfinite> you just need to focus on one gate
[3:25:42] <+SimplyRandy> focus all on one side
[3:25:42] <%Binary_Fireball> all on one side gate
[3:25:43] <%thebonebard> left
[3:25:43] <%BeatH7> @PatStaresAt put you army on the left side
[3:25:44] <%scifimisc> On both sides of one gate
[3:25:44] <%TrafficCohen> Left
[3:25:47] <%Dfreddy8> That way
[3:25:47] <%Imperial_Madman> Overwhelm one side
[3:25:47] <Mister_McDerp> all in the same general area
[3:25:48] <huskarl_zap> WHOLE ARMY ON ONE SIDE
[3:25:50] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> consensus seems to be one side
[3:25:50] <%Binary_Fireball> the wall
[3:25:51] <+FennecZephyr> Overwhelm one spot
[3:25:51] <%Imperial_Madman> Then rush the gate
[3:25:52] <$MemnonV> pick one gate and send everything there
[3:25:52] <%DonFrancisco34> yes
[3:25:53] <%jamesvdv12> just send the towers on one gate and have archers support
[3:25:53] <gastherobots> Yes.
[3:25:54] <derap41> yes
[3:25:54] <Onmi_Khaos> It's good to go to one side of the map
[3:25:54] <%scifimisc> Left click a tower, right click the wall
[3:25:55] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt Use your trolls to bash down the gate, and then use your trolls and pump wagons to take the victory point, put the seige towers on the wall
[3:25:56] <%DonFrancisco34> the wall
[3:25:57] <Mister_McDerp> you click the wall
[3:25:58] <+rowboat_girlyman> set them up opposite from that gate
[3:25:58] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> yeah the wals
[3:25:58] <roguestormtrooper> the wall
[3:25:58] <huskarl_zap> less towers shooting
[3:25:59] <%Imperial_Madman> Go left
[3:25:59] <jackeroff3> click wall with tower
[3:26:00] <%thebonebard> click on wall with tower selected
[3:26:01] <+SimplyRandy> overwhelm on one side
[3:26:02] <@mothmandraws> so deploy them like normal then tell them to attack the wall
[3:26:02] <Mister_McDerp> yes
[3:26:03] <+R_BChe> yes
[3:26:03] <%Binary_Fireball> ya
[3:26:04] <derap41> Exactly
[3:26:05] <%Dfreddy8> DA WALL BOSS
[3:26:08] <%BoomerUnchained> pick gate, then go, yes
[3:26:08] <SilentEric> Yes. Click on the tower, then click on the wall
[3:26:09] <%BeatH7> @PatStaresAt you'll move the towers when the battle starts
[3:26:09] <+oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt The same area, focus your units in one place
[3:26:09] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> ye
[3:26:10] <+FennecZephyr> @PatStaresAt Onece the battle starts, order the tower onto a wall segment likea unit
[3:26:11] <SilentEric> One at a time
[3:26:11] <huskarl_zap> WHOLE ARMY ON ONE SIDE
[3:26:11] <%thebonebard> the wall not the platform
[3:26:12] <+SimplyRandy> once in battle you can target wall with toeer
[3:26:12] <derap41> and troll attack the game with grom
[3:26:14] <%Binary_Fireball> Minis Tirith
[3:26:14] <%scifimisc> yes
[3:26:14] <+Rose_Silvers> order them to attack a wall
[3:26:15] <%DonFrancisco34> yes
[3:26:15] <%Imperial_Madman> When you start battle then you can tell them to move
[3:26:16] <twgrb06> You might want to set them closer during deployment
[3:26:16] <gastherobots> When you hover over the wall with them selected it will show a ghostly kind of thing of where they will go.
[3:26:16] <+rowboat_girlyman> yeah
[3:26:16] <huskarl_zap> in a square
[3:26:16] <%Binary_Fireball> yup
[3:26:17] <Man_in_the_Red> very
[3:26:17] <Mister_McDerp> yeah
[3:26:18] <%MaddyCaddy> Very
[3:26:18] <Zombrocom> Very slow
[3:26:18] <+R_BChe> yes they are
[3:26:18] <roguestormtrooper> yes
[3:26:18] <%Binary_Fireball> slow
[3:26:20] <derap41> yes
[3:26:21] <%thebonebard> very
[3:26:21] <CuttleCrow> protec
[3:26:22] <Monkeyweed21> Focus EVERYONE on the left side
[3:26:22] <@mothmandraws> yep, trolls can attack gate, as can rogue idol your troll can summon
[3:26:22] <+MisterBoneitis> BREAK THE WALLS DOOOOOWN
[3:26:22] <%DukeMoose> yes. theyll stack the sides usually 2 abreast
[3:26:24] <Latija> place the towers close to where you want them to be, once the fight starts select them and right click the wall
[3:26:26] <%jamesvdv12> not too slow
[3:26:27] <NeroInfinite> Very
[3:26:28] <%miguelrod777> TO THE WINDOW
[3:26:28] <+eggstyr0ne> yes but they protect your units
[3:26:29] <+R_BChe> bumrush the gate
[3:26:30] <%juxtest> Very slow but they wont fall down easy
[3:26:31] <%SirGO0SE> so probably do walk?
[3:26:33] <%Imperial_Madman> Yep
[3:26:33] <%jamesvdv12> send the archers
[3:26:34] <%Binary_Fireball> behind
[3:26:34] <Onmi_Khaos> They'll be fine.
[3:26:34] <+oda_flobunaga> vveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy slllllllllllllloooooooooooooooowwwwwwww
[3:26:35] <+lwpabloelenano2hc> behind
[3:26:36] <%QuadraticGravity> you'll probably win before the towers get there.
[3:26:36] <gastherobots> Behind.
[3:26:37] <+rowboat_girlyman> have them keep pace with the towers
[3:26:37] <%Piemono> The towers are slow, but they probably wont die
[3:26:37] <@mothmandraws> just send in towers
[3:26:38] <twgrb06> keep melee behind
[3:26:38] <Mister_McDerp> have them trail behind towers
[3:26:39] <%BeatH7> @PatStaresAt ye but their defensive towers aren't strong enough to kill yours this early in the game
[3:26:39] <+MisterBoneitis> bEHIND
[3:26:42] <Man_in_the_Red> zerg rush the gate, the archers cant hit them close to the wall
[3:26:42] <Klarrann3> you can line up troops behind towers to protect them from the opposing tower shots
[3:26:43] <+FennecZephyr> Behind towers
[3:26:44] <+SimplyRandy> average slowness, send towers first
[3:26:45] <NeroInfinite> Just send in the towers
[3:26:47] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> b r e a t h IN b r e a t h OUT
[3:26:48] <Onmi_Khaos> behind, let them absorb the shots
[3:26:49] <%Aydarkzero> monkaW
[3:26:49] <squirtkitten> SEND EM IN SMOrc
[3:26:50] <SilentEric> Behind the towers. But have the trolls attack the gates
[3:26:51] <Thewoodentree> The towers have stupid range theyll be shooting as soon as you start
[3:26:52] <%jamesvdv12> dont send the foot soldiers until the towers reach the wall
[3:26:57] <+MisterBoneitis> Could use trolls to destroy the gate tho
[3:26:57] <twgrb06> siege monsters can attack the gate as well
[3:26:59] <%DukeMoose> trolls are ranged resistant so they can smack the door open. too
[3:26:59] <gastherobots> Towers can take the hit way better than inf with no cover.
[3:26:59] <%thebonebard> have the rest of the infantry at gate at least thats what i do
[3:27:01] <+eggstyr0ne> Paige is useing her vomit attack in the back ground
[3:27:03] <%Ner234> Paige LUL
[3:27:06] <apupupu> u want them shooting towers. they shoot closest targets
[3:27:12] <SilentEric> @PatStaresAt Have the trolls attack the gate. They are too big for tower.
[3:27:14] <kazadaz> Deploy your WHOLE force on one side. Move towers up to walls, then send trolls and wagons (and Grom) sideways to attack one of the other, undefended gates and get into the town.
[3:27:14] <derap41> you could send you pump wagons to break the right gate
[3:27:17] <+SimplyRandy> trolls can break gate as well
[3:27:18] <+RowenCleric> is chat actually being helpful with this game or annoying?
[3:27:18] <Arisato_II> Archers with towers, melee behind
[3:27:22] <%BoomerUnchained> Guess he could also smash the gate using the big boys
[3:27:22] <gastherobots> Great.
[3:27:28] <Onmi_Khaos> Yup
[3:27:29] <%DonFrancisco34> have your trollls ram the gate since they can't get on the seige towers
[3:27:29] <twgrb06> That's pretty good
[3:27:33] <%Binary_Fireball> Trolls attack gate
[3:27:34] <%QuadraticGravity> Trolls and rock summon @ gate
[3:27:37] <derap41> on the gate

[3:27:42] <%thebonebard> gate
[3:27:52] <derap41> All large unitsshould smash the gate
[3:27:52] <%Aydarkzero> this is nuts
[3:27:52] <Onmi_Khaos> Put your trolls parallel to the gate and send them there with the chariots.
[3:27:54] <%Binary_Fireball> both
[3:27:55] <%DonFrancisco34> all
[3:27:55] <+rowboat_girlyman> both
[3:27:56] <$MemnonV> get your heros under the arch of the gate so they cant get shot at
[3:27:56] <%QuadraticGravity> yes
[3:27:59] <Thewoodentree> Wont Gorm have to go through a gate since hes a chariot?
[3:27:59] <%scifimisc> Both
[3:28:00] <+SimplyRandy> heroes and trolls to attack the gwte
[3:28:00] <roguestormtrooper> both
[3:28:00] <Mister_McDerp> both
[3:28:00] <@mothmandraws> both can do it
[3:28:01] <gastherobots> Large units in general.
[3:28:01] <%thebonebard> both
[3:28:02] <derap41> whatever does most damage
[3:28:02] <+MisterBoneitis> Both
[3:28:03] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt Send your towers to the wall, bash down a gate with trolls and grom, take the victory point
[3:28:05] <%BoomerUnchained> Both
[3:28:05] <+eggstyr0ne> as long as they fit
[3:28:06] <%jamesvdv12> both they wont be able to get up the tower
[3:28:06] <NeroInfinite> both
[3:28:08] <%Binary_Fireball> bolth
[3:28:11] <Onmi_Khaos> all of them
[3:28:11] <+rowboat_girlyman> leave pump wagons behind for now
[3:28:14] <l33tc4k3> but will you pay the troll toll to get this boy's hole?
[3:28:14] <%Imperial_Madman> Both
[3:28:17] <+oda_flobunaga> all
[3:28:17] <apupupu> lords and trolls attack gate
[3:28:18] <NeroInfinite> since they can't use towers yeah
[3:28:22] <Man_in_the_Red> @Thewoodentree he'll just climb up a ladder Kappa
[3:28:27] <@mothmandraws> pump wagons wont be able to do much until gates are open
[3:28:28] <%BeatH7> @PatStaresAt the reason why they tell you to move the army on the side is because that way you won't get shot by as meny of their artillery that is inside their towers in the walls. rush the gate with trolls and take the walls with the 4 towers, get in, ez win
[3:28:30] <stabbityrabbit> @RowenCleric So far, both.
[3:28:37] <Onmi_Khaos> Monstrous units can't use towers, on accounta bein big
[3:28:39] <+rowboat_girlyman> chunky gang
[3:28:48] <+Rose_Silvers> locked groups ruin their pathing,would not reccomend
[3:28:51] <+SimplyRandy> big bois
[3:28:52] <+rowboat_girlyman> melee and arrows behind towers
[3:28:55] <+oda_flobunaga> OH LAWD ITS COMIN
[3:29:05] <@mothmandraws> when you get close to walls summon rogue idol
[3:29:05] <%thebonebard> pat why are you locking the trools
[3:29:09] <Zombrocom> Don't lock your trolls
[3:29:09] <+rowboat_girlyman> leave pump wagons behind until you've breached the games
[3:29:12] <%SirPickelchips> bunch them up to the side so only 1 tower can shoot at them
[3:29:12] <%PerrinIsDead> Gonna start callin my dick the Pump Wagon
[3:29:18] <%jamesvdv12> ur hero wont have great health so if they get hit by missiles hes gonna take some big damage
[3:29:18] <Arisato_II> Beautiful
[3:29:19] <+SimplyRandy> locked group has better enemy targeting but worse movement
[3:29:20] <gastherobots> Dorfs watching the greenskins set up "The fuck they doin over there?"
[3:29:25] <%Binary_Fireball> looks good
[3:29:26] <%SilvaChariot0133> Used to Shogun Mechanics, can you climb walls with infantry here? or is that what the towers are for?
[3:29:29] <twgrb06> you're doing great, Pat
[3:29:30] <Onmi_Khaos> And chariots behind the group
[3:29:30] <+MisterBoneitis> Leave pump wagons behind till the gate's down, then send 'em in

[3:41:29] <derap41> Yeah
[3:41:29] <apupupu> u need to protect trolls flank or they will route
[3:41:30] <Zombrocom> Yeah
[3:41:30] <%BeatH7> yes
[3:41:31] <Misterjablez> lmao this is my first time coming to a Pat stream and of course I see him playing The Goblin Lord

[3:41:39] <%Punchasaur> chat play the game for me
[3:41:39] <+SimplyRandy> ye
[3:41:40] <derap41> But trolls need to have goblins with them
[3:41:40] <%QuadraticGravity> That's how siege towers work, they have stairs inside to get forces over walls.
[3:41:42] <Onmi_Khaos> Yup
[3:41:42] <%maskedriderhero> just climb the walls, all units can climb
[3:41:44] <+rowboat_girlyman> send grom throuhg the gate
[3:41:44] <thehighdrated1> Sometimes Twitch chat isn't helpful Pat remember
[3:41:45] <+oda_flobunaga> better
[3:41:49] <+Rose_Silvers> send the trolls in
[3:41:51] <$MemnonV> you broke the gate already, dont waste time climbing walls now
[3:41:52] <%thebonebard> @PatStaresAt all units also have ladders its not just the seige towers
[3:41:54] <%Binary_Fireball> trick is to not get bunched up behind your own units
[3:42:00] <%maskedriderhero> turn off slow mo
[3:42:01] <+SimplyRandy> she needs to get in range
[3:42:07] <apupupu> u need goblins with trolls or they will route fast

He told the chaos gods to suck his dick after they offered him everything he wished for and more for eternity because they wanted him to work for them. Settra does not follow, Settra rules.

[4:01:49] <%Axellogic> fuck you I didnt help
[4:01:49] <%spiritofmojave> That was really enjoyable, as someone who's never seen Warhammer/this game
[4:01:50] <Thewoodentree> WE REALLY WANT YOU TO KEEP PLAYING
[4:01:50] <+Invaderjaymz> when u play again goblin man

[4:01:51] <zamzoph> We did it, Chat! PogChamp
[4:01:51] <%TaterBurglar> We can do both at the same time
[4:01:51] <+Qits> That's why were so good at goblins, we're stupid, smelly and dumb just like them.
[4:01:53] <+oda_flobunaga> Well, you actually needed help soooooooo
[4:01:54] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> u smel
[4:01:54] <+eggstyr0ne> total war has a steep learning curve
[4:01:56] <%TheHeroAppears> today you smelled useful
[4:01:56] <%DukeMoose> yay we're appreciated
[4:01:57] <%LaughingCatt> that is the stench of knowledge
[4:01:57] <Mirrorcatch> character development
[4:01:58] <$MemnonV> i am a stupid moron who smells and plays warhammer
[4:01:58] <boriss96> True
[4:01:59] <@SoFarFetched> Chat just needs to try and be more specific when explaining things or else it gets confusing.
[4:02:00] <%spiritofmojave> Good stuff!
[4:02:02] <+eggstyr0ne> everyone needs help
[4:02:02] <%Binary_Fireball> I hope you can have more fun with it now
[4:02:02] <%madskull456> no you
[4:02:05] <Zombrocom> We had too many generals
[4:02:05] <+Blackjackal95> @PatStaresAt Do you have Clan Esshin?
[4:02:05] <Monkeyweed21> Dont pull out impregnate me
[4:02:06] <SilentEric> You can't go wrong with DA WAAAGH!
[4:02:07] <%DukeMoose> psaUp
[4:02:07] <%Mister_McDerp> Mister_McDerp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! you did great pat, the game gets way easier with time
[4:02:10] <@commanderclaw> It's a learning cliff
[4:02:14] <%depressed_skeleton> aw
[4:02:17] <stormydaysz> i think i might finally play TW shogun 2
[4:02:21] <NeroInfinite> There were less pepegas in chat today too.
[4:02:22] <Arisato_II> You made me blush
[4:02:24] <%heartlesshealer> it's a learning overhang
[4:02:25] <%jamesvdv12> been playing this game for years its really not too bad tho its more daunting than it seems
[4:02:25] <%SilvaChariot0133> Shogun 2 is the shit
[4:02:27] <+eggstyr0ne> oh yeah
[4:02:29] <JDebss> I've been struggling with TWW2 as well
[4:02:31] <%Valdorick> Shogun 2 is amazing
[4:02:32] <derekwst3> i was not paying to much attention, but yeah looks a little confusing
[4:02:33] <%weissguard> I absolutely got a bit overwhelmed just watching.
[4:02:34] <l33tc4k3> i only really care about real history stuff so id probably not play this one ever but its good to see it
[4:02:35] <Wondabarrapa> elves are for coward babies
[4:02:36] <gastherobots> It's weird in that it's like most strat games, at first you're like "oh god of fuck" for HOURS then it all just kind of clicks one time when you don't think about it.
[4:02:36] <%MonsterEnvy> It's a curve
[4:02:37] <j0ustar> elves? there's your problem
[4:02:39] <+oda_flobunaga> there is still much to learn young padawan
[4:02:41] <%scifimisc> Yeeeeah
[4:02:43] <Monkeyweed21> It helps when you know how to siege
[4:02:44] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> wooo
[4:02:44] <bolero765> YES
[4:02:45] <%Binary_Fireball> YAAAYY
[4:02:45] <Zombrocom> @PatStaresAt I think locking your formations is kinda fucking with you
[4:02:45] <%SirGO0SE> ah :)
[4:02:45] <Thewoodentree> YES YES
[4:02:45] <%MaddyCaddy> ye
[4:02:45] <+SimplyRandy> The learning curve is rough, but people who are into this series have 500 hours across 6 games and have forgotten
[4:02:46] <Man_in_the_Red> the best practice is the skirmish mode thats all battles
[4:02:46] <zamzoph> yeyeyeye
[4:02:47] <OvaltineDream> Ayyy
[4:02:48] <%spiritofmojave> Totallyyyyy
[4:02:48] <l33tc4k3> shogun 2 is great but the AI is no joke
[4:02:49] <+eggstyr0ne> YAY
[4:02:50] <%juxtest> Siege battles always meant huge casualties to me
[4:02:51] <%thebeargoesHONK> thebeargoesHONK subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Hey i know Woolie is the bigger Fighting game fan, but i had a question for you. Do you think in game timers should continue to run during supers/in game cut scenes/ etc.... even if that means the game ends while the super is still going on?
[4:02:53] <@SoFarFetched> one offs are fine
[4:02:53] <+Nothing_Wild> Probably got people who really want you to do well, so you do more.
[4:02:54] <zamzoph> @PatStaresAt What race do you REALLY want to play as?
[4:02:54] <Onmi_Khaos> Until I learned to cheese Siege battles, I basically just autoresolved them
[4:02:55] <brutalgenie> Yes!
[4:02:55] <+Redeyes_NI> Once you're into one you're into them all
[4:02:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> Orb Warrrs
[4:02:57] <@SoFarFetched> here and there
[4:02:59] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I don't mind.
[4:03:01] <Thewoodentree> GOOD ENOUGH
[4:03:02] <Onmi_Khaos> Once I learned how to cheese, it became easy
[4:03:05] <%SirGO0SE> thats fun :)
[4:03:05] <Zombrocom> Yeah that's cool
[4:03:06] <%scifimisc> That works great
[4:03:06] <+oda_flobunaga> Learn other factions by doing custom battle
[4:03:07] <%Binary_Fireball> hell yea
[4:03:11] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, probably better for "why not?" streams
[4:03:17] <+Lost_Zombie> Yeah I'd watch it
[4:03:18] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> I'm excited for that.
[4:03:20] <%DukeMoose> that'd be fun. just hop in take a peek stream
[4:03:31] <Man_in_the_Red> i've played too much assassin's creed to care about Tsushima

[4:03:33] <%Diana869> second son is fun
[4:03:33] <Monkeyweed21> Second Son really?
[4:03:37] <gastherobots> It looks like it does Batman better than Batman.

[4:04:00] <dinnydanny777> Second Son definitely isn't bad
[4:04:02] <JDebss> I think it's looking worse every time I see more :(
[4:04:08] <zamzoph> 40k doesn't do rank armies. Except if you're guard
[4:04:18] <+ryujinran> i wish there was another legit dawn of war
[4:04:19] <%thebonebard> dawn of war is basically the tabletop but with buildings
[4:04:19] <%Shadowthedigger> 40k wouldn't work for Total War.
[4:04:20] <derap41> They keep saying 40k wouldn't work with total war frame work
[4:04:20] <@SoFarFetched> yes
[4:04:21] <%MaddyCaddy> Total war games don't usually do modern firearms
[4:04:24] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[4:04:25] <%Shadicara> LUL
[4:04:26] <%NovaKnightmare> Pat's beating off to 40k total war
[4:04:27] <@SoFarFetched> No he's messing with his balls
[4:04:27] <gastherobots> I never thought 40k would work with Total War, but then someone pointed out how in a bunch of art space marines and orks are just in a fucking line formation charging at each other.
[4:04:28] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:04:29] <%heartlesshealer> LUL
[4:04:29] <gastherobots> So fuck it.
[4:04:29] <@SoFarFetched> cause they're huge
[4:04:30] <Man_in_the_Red> 40K would be hard to make a total war of what with all the guns
[4:04:31] <@mothmandraws> they might do a game but it wouldnt be same style system"
[4:04:33] <%spiritofmojave> Fat phantom penor
[4:04:33] <%Ner234> BANNED
[4:04:35] <Zombrocom> Total warhammer has done really well
[4:04:35] <%DukeMoose> Three Kingdons also güd
[4:04:35] <+Remery_> The Phantom Peen
[4:04:35] <%SirGO0SE> sipsipGasm sipsipDab
[4:04:37] <+Nothing_Wild> Even guard, it doesn't fit.
[4:04:39] <%Valdorick> RIP DAWN OF WAR
[4:04:39] <%DukeMoose> much HONOR
[4:04:40] <%scifimisc> They could make it work
[4:04:41] <+oda_flobunaga> 40K Sanktus REACH
[4:04:41] <JDebss> dawn of war is pretty close
[4:04:42] <%Mister_McDerp> they might do an age of sigmar total war, to try to increase its popularity
[4:04:42] <+SimplyRandy> The likelihood of 40k is hit or miss. engine / gameplay formula not built for like all ranhed
[4:04:44] <Man_in_the_Red> or, you know, Starcraft Kappa
[4:04:45] <%Binary_Fireball> Dawn of War 3 was the biggest disappointmnet
[4:04:46] <VigilantShield> now I'm sad because of dawn of war
[4:04:48] <Zombrocom> I miss dawn of war :(
[4:04:52] <%thebonebard> give me dawn of war without building management\
[4:04:54] <TCDerps> dude 40k but with gameplay SW: Empire at War
[4:05:01] <gastherobots> THIS IS TRUE
[4:05:04] <Saltmeisterr> why was dawn of war 3 bad?
[4:05:09] <%Valdorick> Fair
[4:05:10] <Saltmeisterr> i wanna know
[4:05:10] <+eggstyr0ne> True
[4:05:12] <JDebss> Dawn of war 1 with ever expansion is great
[4:05:13] <%Binary_Fireball> Meeeeeh
[4:05:13] <Man_in_the_Red> 40K would make for a good Xcom
[4:05:14] <%spiritofmojave> It's tru
[4:05:14] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> is it?
[4:05:14] <OvaltineDream> RIP my old indian army after unlocking sikhs
[4:05:16] <huskarl_zap> Crusaders with Dane axes
[4:05:17] <Monkeyweed21> 40k would need to be 1 super planet with no space stuff for Total War
[4:05:17] <%Shadowthedigger> Yup, any post-Napoleonics warfare doesn't work in TW
[4:05:19] <stormydaysz> a total war style game for 40k would be awesome , this company doesnt really go into that
[4:05:22] <camelwizard> Warhammer adds so much to the Total War formula, glad it's popular
[4:05:23] <Man_in_the_Red> Mordheim was alright
[4:05:23] <l33tc4k3> yeah i mean im a history guy but this looks fun
[4:05:25] <+eggstyr0ne> Yeah history is stupid
[4:05:25] <+PenmanLupine> gonna be tasting that pepperoni for days
[4:05:27] <pmtriox> all i got was that DoW3 was all hero units and shit
[4:05:27] <kindashagg> Can't make all the nerds happy
[4:05:29] <gastherobots> Three Kingdoms got it right by having a historical mode and a, well, Three Kingdoms Book mode where Lu Bu is a god.
[4:05:31] <%SilvaChariot0133> Indian Elephants marching through Paris Kappa
[4:05:31] <%Valdorick> Also, as a Historical Total War player, Warhammer is fine (and infact amazing)
[4:05:35] <%DukeMoose> playing India in Total war empire was fucking GOOD
[4:05:37] <+Nothing_Wild> Maybe something like End War? But it'd have to be different.
[4:05:37] <%Binary_Fireball> is Pat any good at RTS games?
[4:05:38] <%trustycoyote> But cold pizza is good!
[4:05:39] <%scifimisc> You could do tw 40k buy making the campaign map a galactic map
[4:05:40] <gastherobots> DO NOT PURSUE
[4:05:40] <+SimplyRandy> as a historical can warhammer 2 is best total war game
[4:05:43] <@SoFarFetched> she ate the WHOOLLLLE thing
[4:05:45] <%pilgrimsayswhat> put oven on stick and SWING
[4:05:47] <%thebonebard> i have never actually met a total war fan be angry with warhammer
[4:05:51] <%Imperial_Madman> Cold pizza is good
[4:05:52] <%SirGO0SE> pizza gets cold fast why is this
[4:05:55] <%trustycoyote> Fair
[4:06:05] <%WhereIsWill> room temp? WutFace
[4:06:08] <pmtriox> 40k could work but they'd have to rework almost everything about it
[4:06:12] <%MaddyCaddy> Join an FC
[4:06:12] <%jamesvdv12> I wish warhammer 2 had the naval battles like shogun 2
[4:06:13] <%SilvaChariot0133> no, go full toxic Kappa
[4:06:13] <%spiritofmojave> Read your tooltips!
[4:06:14] <+linSP> be HONEST
[4:06:15] <+Grayhammatter> get past the filler
[4:06:17] <Man_in_the_Red> @SirGO0SE flat surface for heat to escape from
[4:06:19] <pmtriox> so may as well just make a whole new game at that point

[4:06:24] <gastherobots> @thebonebard Total War Center was fucking SALT CENTRAL when it got announced. But that site has been dying for years now. Grognards are the worst.
[4:06:24] <stormydaysz> TELL PEOPLE THEY DONT PAY YOUR SUB WHEN YOU FUCK UP
[4:06:28] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> 40k being planet locked for total war is fine, if I get to play Nids
[4:06:37] <+Remery_> Yea the starter pack for FF14 is free on playstation
[4:06:43] <%SirGO0SE> @Man_in_the_Red thonk
[4:06:44] <+Nothing_Wild> It'd need a new engine, for sure.
[4:06:49] <%Aydarkzero> one day i'll have the courage to play that game instead of just making a character and then stop playing right away LUL
[4:06:53] <%thebonebard> huh, guess i didnt see that meltdown @gastherobots

[4:12:52] <NeroInfinite> Tau are trash FIGHT MENERDS
[4:12:53] <huskarl_zap> DISSAVOW!
[4:12:56] <Zombrocom> Sure why not
[4:12:56] <Monkeyweed21> bingo
[4:12:57] <%MaddyCaddy> Depends on you
[4:12:58] <%Mister_McDerp> yeah generally
[4:13:01] <%MaddyCaddy> I wouldn't
[4:13:02] <%Retinolgaming> YEP
[4:13:02] <+Nothing_Wild> TAu bAd.
[4:13:02] <+eggstyr0ne> yeah you can
[4:13:03] <Man_in_the_Red> thats the plan with Vampire lords
[4:13:03] <%Piemono> Depends
[4:13:04] <%heartlesshealer> if you wanna
[4:13:04] <+linSP> what are pawns
[4:13:05] <gastherobots> Canon fodder army is real and legit
[4:13:06] <%thebonebard> depends on how rich you are
[4:13:09] <+Remery_> Tau good
[4:13:11] <%DukeMoose> depends yea.
[4:13:13] <%Mister_McDerp> depends on income
[4:13:13] <+ishouldfeelbad> not unless you can't afford better
[4:13:13] <derap41> Ifyou're playing orcs skaven or vampires then yes
[4:13:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> Encourage the gobalins to breed to raise more soldiers
[4:13:16] <%MaddyCaddy> That's bad for your economy IMO
[4:13:20] <+eggstyr0ne> but the more armys the more you pay for them
[4:13:20] <Visorak6> 40k is expensive as FUCK
[4:13:21] <%scifimisc> More territory means more armies
[4:13:24] <ShichiNoBushi> Here comes doze boyz!
[4:13:24] <huskarl_zap> Wagghs are free
[4:13:25] <%DukeMoose> WAAAUGH armies are that too
[4:13:26] <+SimplyRandy> depends, you might need a solid comp if you have them somewhere else
[4:13:30] <Man_in_the_Red> get a full stack of skelebois and have Kammler command all the flying units
[4:13:30] <Zombrocom> Early game trash stacks are good meantshields, late game you can make multiple doomstacks
[4:13:31] <%FaderPotater> FaderPotater subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! New to this whole twitch prime thing, glad it lets me support the weird ginger man.
[4:13:31] <JDebss> I have 3 armies
[4:13:33] <lloyddboy> DA BOYZ ARR BACK IN TOWN
[4:13:36] <+SimplyRandy> upkeep scales with army count
[4:13:36] <VigilantShield> yes more armies get bigger upkeep penalties
[4:13:37] <%DukeMoose> you get 20 boys tacked onto your 20 stack
[4:13:40] <%thebonebard> yea but your money is big then you can get big good units in 40 stacks
[4:13:40] <Onmi_Khaos> Yeah but you get richer with more land
[4:13:41] <%MaddyCaddy> Have two good armies and get more settlements
[4:13:42] <gastherobots> The undead can have a FUCKLOAD of skeletons. 4 armies full of nothing but skeletons and like one with dragons is great.
[4:13:44] <Onmi_Khaos> More land mean more armies
[4:13:45] <kindashagg> There's an old Rome strat of throwing peasants at the enemy before sending the actual guys in. Super effective
[4:13:47] <Onmi_Khaos> more armies means more land
[4:13:53] <%Piemono> For Skaven a 2nd trash army is super legit
[4:14:20] <Man_in_the_Red> Skaven LOVE meatshields
[4:14:26] <Zombrocom> Cinematic supers should pause the timer
[4:14:28] <%Valdorick> If you made the input, you should not get fucked over because of the timer.
[4:14:30] <umm_idunno> time scam super is hype tho
[4:14:34] <%OopsyDoops> hey Pat hope stream was good
[4:14:48] <+Nothing_Wild> "TAU Bad." "Surely Tau not as bad as you pruport?" ">:("
[4:14:49] <@SoFarFetched> It hit it

[4:14:57] <+Grayhammatter> that's fine
[4:14:59] <Man_in_the_Red> Cinimatic supers should freeze the timer, fireball supers or stuff that chips dont though
