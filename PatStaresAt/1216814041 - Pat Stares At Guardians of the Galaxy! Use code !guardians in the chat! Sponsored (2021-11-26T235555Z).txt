[0:04:40] <%infinitelyungodly> Same here. Heard it was fun.
[0:04:43] <%ennui_on_me> People are saying it's got some really good writing
[0:04:44] <%BinaryFireball> ahhhhhh
[0:04:47] <%Nope80808> Combat is a 5/10 at best but everything else is a pretty solid.
[0:04:51] <%GalacticaPhanto> Doc seems to like it a lot so it has to be at least somewhat fun
[0:04:52] <idrinkmoxie> I wonder if Pat will enjoy the game or his Spite will make him not enjoy it
[0:04:52] <SocialMisfitGamer> It’s surprisingly a really fun game
[0:05:05] <%RealThiele> yea combat is just grab the black hole bomb and succ
[0:05:09] <%BinaryFireball> nice, GotG is like the only marvel stuff I actually enjoy

[0:06:35] <%THATGUY_789> how much copyrighted music is in this game
[0:06:46] <~PatStaresAt> A LOT
[0:06:49] <%KineticZen> The combat looked really limp in the trailer, hope it's more interesting in game
[0:06:50] <%RealThiele> the overall story is fine guardians of the galaxy work better when they are trying to ignore all the galactic marvel stuff
[0:06:52] <%Nope80808> @THATGUY_789 Yes
[0:06:53] <%BinaryFireball> probably all of it lol
[0:06:53] <OldManDeckardCain> Hey Pat, how do you feel about the fitting sequel of Omikron that came out recently? Kappa

[0:38:32] <Mistloop> MCU Drax has a problem where he turns into lolrandum man in the second movie and his character stops making much sense

[0:41:52] <Slimshazbot> @TonyBStreaming Pleasantly surprised to hear that, may have to look into playing this.
[0:41:53] <MyNameIsRasus> they got the mcu voice actors for the brazillian dub of this game, i might buy this now
[0:41:55] <%hereiam407> This game is very funny, very fun, and very good
[0:41:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> God this game is good
[0:41:56] <SilverFaustX> close the fridge
[0:41:59] <+allups> thats like mine in my room
[0:42:00] <+TopTieramisu> it looks like a big pill
[0:42:03] <frankiesworld> you can read it in photo mode
[0:42:03] <stote44> the goblins are in the negative zone
[0:42:06] <%valriot> The art direction in this is real good
[0:42:07] <%HotSauceFiend> a New Goblin has been discovered: Fridge-Goblin.
[0:42:11] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god they're gonna pull the entire field down
[0:42:14] <ape_hawk> that looks like a red blood cell
[0:42:15] <%twistedj3ster> into the giant prilosec!
[0:42:15] <+titansloth93> minor gripe, the stars not moving is kinda weird
[0:42:18] <%Nope80808> Do the fridge at least once everytime you go back to ship pat. There is dialog.
[0:42:19] <%hereiam407> A giant space bacteria looking thing
[0:42:22] <%JamesCorck> There's a bit too much dialogue, I think.
[0:42:23] <TheShockVox> wish they got the actors from the Telltale game but it seems cool so far
[0:42:27] <+allups> pat this game did look bad
[0:42:36] <ScreamLord> That fucking fridge is the most relatable thing ever put in a video game
[0:42:44] <+johnnychopsocky> I have the Fridge Goblin in real life.  It's not fun

[0:44:46] <quantras6> @commanderapathy I believe so
[0:44:49] <%hereiam407> It has a purpose
[0:44:50] <@Ranryu692> the music isn't off, it's replaced with non-licensed music
[0:44:51] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Team Rocket
[0:44:52] <+Mrbaconator> they should use a real curse word like PECK
[0:44:54] <+Vigonept> this seems good so far
[0:44:55] <+Goku01899> Big League Chew
[0:44:55] <%Frost_Quill> Team Rocket's blasting off again?

[0:44:59] <%VictorVonLouche> @VictorVonLouche no like poor quality.
[0:45:01] <heartlesshealer> is it me does Rocket's voice here conjure up mental images of tech nerds like Billy Power Rangers?
[0:45:05] <$Grimlockfly> Cheer500  This entire game is 'that part' of Control and Alan Wake for the entire game
[0:45:07] <retrosadness> his skin is not teal
[0:45:08] <%chiazam> This music is too loud
[0:45:09] <%THATGUY_789> or turk wise
[0:45:10] <%Bailey__Gaming> team rocket's blasting off again
[0:45:11] <The_Forgotten_Alligator> so what music would be playing if streamer mode was off
[0:45:21] <MyNameIsRasus> Music do be kinda loud
[0:45:23] <%commanderapathy> okay so they did the spiderman thing
[0:45:23] <%hereiam407> Probably this music
[0:45:24] <@Lion_kun> something cooler and less generic I bet
[0:45:27] <+izanagi22> @VictorVonLouche If it's off-note, it's may be your stream trying to catch up without buffering, it's a feature of Twitch
[0:45:27] <%solracc25> not green

[0:45:41] <Ghostduck01> still not a fan of the designs in this tbh

[0:46:00] <AngryPumpkin1995> I like the character designs. I kinda thought I'd hate them

[0:46:03] <TonyBStreaming> @The_Forgotten_Alligator still this, but licensed music plays in the huddle mode and the hub ship

[0:46:44] <Blank9> mass effect
[0:46:54] <leinadtonu> Normally I hate "talky" games but the banter in this seems fine.

[0:46:56] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> the sequel to the oasis song
[0:46:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> that jump looks like it feels bad

[0:47:03] <%twistedj3ster> is this a metroid prime?
[0:47:07] <TonyBStreaming> LORE IS EVERYWHERE
[0:47:11] <%PrimalDweeb> But it's mostly unimportant.
[0:47:19] <$StrawberryPantsu> @PatStaresAt They never shut up
[0:47:20] <heartlesshealer> at least this game knows how to do round shapes going by the environment

[0:48:27] <+Vigonept> pat why were people shitting on this again

[0:49:08] <%valriot> Yeah the art is super good
[0:49:12] <+johnnychopsocky> and nobody asked for GOTG
[0:49:13] <rytisone> looks like a bunch of bubblegum
[0:49:14] <emil_hunter1> I hate the red flash everytime you search in this game
[0:49:16] <%CoffeeKaiju> @Ghostduck01 They're based on alternate/previous designs

[0:51:11] <%shurtal> you need to wait for a crafting bench
[0:51:13] <Astrophizz> at the bench
[0:51:15] <+Extrallent> what you use the componenets for
[0:51:20] <SaltyAzteca> did we make the flark jokes already
[0:51:21] <SomeStrangeBroad> I am groot
[0:51:24] <+MisterAvry> is that Arkham like combat or have I just played Arkham too recently?
[0:51:29] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> IMO I wish they could get the guy doing this Star Lord to replace Chris Pratt in the MCU.
[0:51:35] <Ghostduck01> @coffeekaiju Thats actually pretty cool
[0:51:39] <+BrickleBork> its roorii live! PogChamp
[0:51:49] <TonyBStreaming> @MisterAvry closer to DMC than Arkham imo
[0:51:51] <%hereiam407> Yep
[0:51:52] <+MisterAvry> neat
[0:51:53] <+SuichiTanaka> Yeah, there's tons of contextual dialog
[0:51:55] <$Grimlockfly> Rocket and quill bros
[0:51:58] <@ssjklyco> There' a LOT of diaolog
[0:51:59] <%hereiam407> They comment when you leave the main path
[0:52:06] <%AHomeschoolDropout> God I wish they'd make a new Deus Ex
[0:52:06] <Slimshazbot> Like holy shit this environment art is incredible
[0:52:07] <+MisterAvry> @TonyBStreaming gotcha
[0:52:10] <+critikal_bit> The context dialogue is some of the best I've seen
[0:52:10] <AngryPumpkin1995> they have a LOT of dialogue it seems
[0:52:11] <+johnnychopsocky> I like the Oxenfree-esqe banter system
[0:52:12] <$Grimlockfly> Yeah they’ll shit talk u wandering around all day
[0:52:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I like that Quill has been hanging with Rocket and Groot for several years b4 Drax and Gamora join
[0:52:21] <pillowwasp> There’s so much contextual dialogue
[0:52:21] <heartlesshealer> they seem to have path-tracking dialogue, neat
[0:52:25] <%GarbageNirvana> Crazy what you can do with a game when you have both time and money
[0:52:33] <skeletonkingofmanlets> this lvl design reminds me of FFVII remake
[0:52:33] <@Moobot> Check out Guardians of the Galaxy here! tinyurl.com/ypfpymjc
[0:52:38] <%PrimalDweeb> They'll talk about you every time you wonder off.

[0:53:30] <%Frost_Quill> This looks really good so far actually.
[0:53:32] <emoonimoo> This is already waaaay more appealing than Avengers
[0:53:33] <amiavamp> The answer should've been "but every other game would put a treasure chest there"
[0:53:37] <%Mister_McDerp> I love a game that shames you for your choices
[0:53:38] <+SuichiTanaka> The PR for this game failed it so badly. It's a fantastic story game.
[0:53:41] <%JamesCorck> NGL, Rocket shittalking you and dunking on you is pretty great.
[0:53:46] <+TheDandyVtuber> Does Pat want to know when he's missed costumes and stuff?

[0:54:48] <ITechedDat> something about the jump animation looks jank
[0:55:03] <+allups> @dekkitout lmao fuk that got me
[0:55:04] <+johnnychopsocky> Rocket is an accurate representation of the levels of shade a raccoon would throw at you if it could talk
[0:55:10] <%NocturneNovember> So do SE sponsors still require you to thank them 3 times an hour like they did with Nier earlier this year?
[0:55:20] <%cooldude69xx> @ITechedDat It does look like someone went "good enough"
[0:55:20] <%hereiam407> @johnnychopsocky He's not a raccoon
[0:55:22] <%JamesCorck> It's seems they've kept their GotG characterisation from the movies rather than from the comics.
[0:55:27] <RUDEBEAR> @ITechedDat camera is super jumpy
[0:55:29] <SomeStrangeBroad> that pink goop is odd looking
[0:55:32] <%PrimalDweeb> Hurry kill it Pat!
[0:55:39] <%hereiam407> Get ready for comeptition
[0:55:47] <+johnnychopsocky> I said "representation".  Still cool.

[0:56:37] <%chiazam> @ssjklyco sprites are universal
[0:56:38] <+allups> Rocket love the sounds of his own voice, which is funny cuZ he also hates himself
[0:56:40] <%PrimalDweeb> I mean, you don't have too but; do you really wanna owe Rocket money?
[0:56:42] <%hereiam407> @quantras6 Yeh
[0:56:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @quantras6 yeah it was meh
[0:56:49] <TonyBStreaming> @quantras6 yeah, it was ok, nothing too crazy
[0:56:51] <+johnnychopsocky> Rocket would be the worst friend to have if you had mind goblins
[0:57:13] <+johnnychopsocky> especially if he learned them
[0:57:14] <californaya> Honestly? The Telltale game was one of the better Telltale games
[0:57:25] <martinhadameme> Rocket and Groot christmas special is gonna be so fun
[0:57:29] <%BlackStarAura> BlackStarAura subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Just bought the game through your link. Thanks, Pat!

[1:02:39] <@Ranryu692> @TonyBStreaming that we've seen so far this stream, that is
[1:02:43] <Make_me_mad> Honestly the game part is okay, but I think the gameplay is the weakest part of this thing. Chapter 2 is where I got super impressed by it, and it was all in the story and characters.
[1:02:44] <%Puhff> git rekt
[1:02:52] <Ghostduck01> @Omegaanimus Ah okay
[1:03:01] <ape_hawk> i havent seen dialogue for failure options since new vegas
[1:03:02] <SomeStrangeBroad> groot is groot
[1:03:12] <TonyBStreaming> @Ranryu692 I figured, thank you for confirming
[1:03:19] <notToph> fluffy_sauce the game is like 90% dialogue and you want an option to reduce it? lol
[1:03:24] <ape_hawk> drax says FUCK THE POLICE
[1:03:26] <%Monkeyweed21> NARC PAT
[1:03:27] <BarnYardFiddler> In life there is always dialogue for failure LUL

[1:03:40] <%Puhff> Everybody Disliked that
[1:03:41] <+TopTieramisu> LUL
[1:03:45] <+SuichiTanaka> The gameplay isn't fantastic, but it's serviceable. It gets a lot better as the upgrades and story unlocks happen
[1:03:52] <%KetsuoTaberu> oh look, an arena
[1:03:54] <%greasypete00> big fight time
[1:03:54] <%hereiam407> What? No..

[1:04:11] <+Brokenothello> @barnyardfiddler whats the dialogue for russian roulette?
[1:04:24] <%jackythefrost> @fluffy_sauce Most of the game is dialogue, even moreso than shooting
[1:04:29] <%hereiam407> Kickball time
[1:04:29] <quantras6> from what I saw gameplay is just okay, it's you running around shooting and dodging while you order guardians to use abilities
[1:04:30] <%jackythefrost> its kinda the draw
[1:04:32] <Make_me_mad> The gameplay feels almost like filler between dialogue and cutscenes, but the story's shockingly well done.
[1:04:37] <%KineticZen> psaBlind
[1:04:37] <BarnYardFiddler> @brokenothello Привет
[1:04:37] <%VictorVonLouche> Missed the goo lol
[1:04:41] <%hereiam407> Its like 60% dialogue, and 40% combat
[1:04:46] <%PrimalDweeb> I know you have a time limit, so I'm just going to tell you. It's up!
[1:04:57] <fluffy_sauce> @notToph games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age did background chatter between the characters great......this game seems like there isn't even 1 second without someone talking

[1:07:58] <ape_hawk> oh
[1:07:59] <Slimshazbot> @SinnerEbru It actually seems super legit so far
[1:08:00] <sirtommygunn> been here for 2 seconds and man i do not like the sounds this game is making

[1:13:55] <mr_saturday93> kill those nasty things
[1:14:02] <Make_me_mad> It's definitely a combo of comics and MCU, but it leans much more heavily on the comics. Drax is probably the thing that's most like the movies.
[1:14:03] <%PrimalDweeb> Noice
[1:14:05] <@Ranryu692> comics Drax once wielded the Power stone via a saxophone
[1:14:10] <%Omegaanimus> This game actually plays around with stuff to make a more distinct canon that only works for this game and not the comics or movies
[1:14:15] <AngryPumpkin1995> Space maggots
[1:14:16] <%PrimalDweeb> But he can still catch up
[1:14:24] <+MisterAvry> Rocket's quick draw is no match for hall wugging

[1:15:03] <%Nope80808> He's you but engineer.
[1:15:03] <Make_me_mad> He is SUCH an asshole.
[1:15:05] <xiccy> But Pat you like cheaters

[1:15:25] <%FingaLights> @ssjklyco 👍
[1:15:28] <californaya> no, he likes cheating. very important difference.

[1:15:33] <Dr_Mooose> dayum
[1:15:34] <fluke_LKZ> It's like Pat is looking at a mirror and seeing a space talking raccoon.
[1:15:40] <%hereiam407> Rockets powers are so satisfying
[1:15:41] <ape_hawk> Rocket casted Fireball!

[1:16:41] <+r4ndom_villan> @MisterAvry you get more
[1:16:47] <Spiralpower1620> I think they should go crazier with the combat and team attacks in a sequel
[1:16:58] <+TopTieramisu> it's ike dmc2
[1:17:01] <+SuichiTanaka> Combat slowly unlocks moves as the game goes on. It gets more interesting later.
[1:17:02] <%greasypete00> what if the final tier of the style meter was just poggers
[1:17:03] <%GarbageNirvana> gross

[1:17:11] <californaya> I would probably love this more if you could actually just play as the other Guardians
[1:17:15] <quantras6> @misteravry it is the start of the game but yeah, it overall seems fairly basic
[1:17:17] <TheBadoe> makes sense
[1:17:19] <Profmcstevie> There's also an active reload super shot, so do just overheat your guns for fun
[1:17:20] <%furiousfurioso> oh its like monhun bows
[1:17:21] <Make_me_mad> Combat gets better when you unlock your actual moves, but yeah it's pretty boring at the start. I don't think it ever gets good but it stays serviceable.

[1:17:59] <%coward_man> rocket cheated even harder
[1:17:59] <+SuichiTanaka> For a game this focused on story, the best thing the action can do is just not bring the game down.
[1:18:00] <SomeAsianDood> @Slimshazbot he got 5 points for that fight of course

[1:28:06] <%JonathLP> @PatStaresAt And what did you learn?
[1:28:06] <%NitronStreams> SICK
[1:28:08] <%Frost_Quill> This game looks REALLY good so far.
[1:28:08] <DusK_The_Stray> Absolutely played
[1:28:09] <Voidvas> WOAH GAME DESIGN
[1:28:10] <+ALazo> would've have been rocket otherwise anyway
[1:28:12] <Slimshazbot> Oh that's neat
[1:28:13] <ape_hawk> i feel like rocket woulda shot it anyway
[1:28:13] <Make_me_mad> If you don't then Rocket shoots it and then you get to give him shit about it the entire game. It's great.
[1:28:14] <+johnnychopsocky> shit, never even considered that
[1:28:14] <Astrophizz> conditioned
[1:28:16] <%hereiam407> You know what, this game is pretty good
[1:28:21] <tanklets> Oh god I forgot theres a journal in this game
[1:28:23] <SomeAsianDood> Movie skin Pog
[1:28:25] <scrumbotime> da moovie
[1:28:29] <tanklets> I should read that lol
[1:28:30] <cartakus> Best groot
[1:28:31] <AngryPumpkin1995> I am so far, impressed with the game
[1:28:33] <%MidnightBurst12> set up to fuck up
[1:28:33] <californaya> Naked Groot
[1:28:34] <%dekkitout> I like how it cites the costume origins
[1:28:36] <AngryAsian5> Does that mean there's a Chris Pratt skin? LUL
[1:28:37] <Slimshazbot> I like the other one more tbh
[1:28:38] <AngryPumpkin1995> game groot looks better :P
[1:28:40] <TonyBStreaming> Just one I think
[1:28:40] <%FingaLights> I clapped when I saw it
[1:28:41] <+Extrallent> Just the rocket movie one
[1:28:41] <%notsoy> hope there's one of gamora's old-timey outfits
[1:28:42] <%ShawnTK_> you havent
[1:28:42] <TheBadoe> it feels like probably
[1:28:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> nope
[1:28:44] <+Cobaltor_252> I kinda like buff Groot better
[1:28:45] <+johnnychopsocky> Each costume has a write up about it
[1:28:45] <$velgaduere> eh, you'll find a lot more
[1:28:46] <+Count_Graagh> A couple
[1:28:47] <tanklets> You found your first wayyy before I did
[1:28:48] <%valriot> No, also this game is pretty long tbh
[1:28:49] <SunsetJack> You might have a costume already for Rocket but not sure.
[1:28:49] <%Dakuu75> imo: all of groot's costume's sucked in this. his default was suprisingly good, and the best
[1:28:50] <dmtjinni> missed an item upstaires
[1:28:50] <Wanhangidyilinya> 37
[1:28:52] <%Axellogic> Drax ones are easy to miss
[1:28:53] <mental_mashup> is there a mario skin?
[1:28:56] <%greasypete00> movie groot looks weird in not-movie instance
[1:28:58] <%MisterRockett> I'm honestly surprised Paige isn't here since the only Marvel content she consumes is ones with Rocket in it.
[1:29:00] <SomeAsianDood> Naw you're fine
[1:29:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat one per level
[1:29:03] <$realm_forge> I bet none of them matter
[1:29:06] <%PrimalDweeb> I wish they had Baby Groot, but no such luck.
[1:29:08] <quantras6> @angryasian5 it's properly the same face just wearing Pratt's outfit
[1:29:10] <IntrepidEye> oh no streamer modes on. Understandable but unfortunate
[1:29:19] <Slimshazbot> How long is this game?
[1:29:21] <Voidvas> Chris- san is so cool
[1:29:23] <Make_me_mad> Yeah Groot's the only one with not-great costumes in the game. Everyone else has some rad shit.
[1:29:25] <%FingaLights> This looks way better than I thought
[1:29:26] <+johnnychopsocky> Dang, Movie Groot looks small
[1:29:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @realm_forge the Apocalypse ones look sick as hell
[1:29:32] <%PrimalDweeb> Very long
[1:29:33] <cartakus> I wonder if they had the idea of letting you play as the others
[1:29:35] <%hereiam407> @Slimshazbot About 20 hours
[1:29:38] <jbrachob> you missed all of them, that was the final costume
[1:29:39] <%jackythefrost> @Slimshazbot 25-ish hours
[1:29:40] <%Dakuu75> @Slimshazbot pretty long, like a good 30+ hours

[1:30:22] <%Nope80808> Rocket also botches words alot.
[1:30:26] <heart_ablaze> !guardians
[1:30:27] <@Ranryu692> @mcjimbo12 he can understand. Groot is actually speaking a language that others can learn
[1:30:31] <+Cobaltor_252> uh the sponsor link doesn't lead anywhere
[1:30:47] <@Ranryu692> @mcjimbo12 unless this version is just making it up, but I doubt it
[1:30:48] <+mcjimbo12> Ranryu692 lol that's dumb i like it
[1:30:49] <AngryAsian5> I wonder how much dialogue there would be between them if he let the game keep playing.
[1:30:53] <%hereiam407> Rocket speaks Goots language, but not at a professional level
[1:30:54] <$velgaduere> Rocket legitimately understands Groot's language. can't remember what it's called tho

[1:57:58] <%hereiam407> Can anyone guitar solo over text?
[1:58:08] <+nightwing1936> Didn't they have their own band to do music for this? I figured that meant they did music for the streaming mode?
[1:58:10] <%greasypete00> the framerate is holding up very well for how much is going on
[1:58:12] <%PrimalDweeb> Yep
[1:58:16] <irisluv333> this game is the most structurally anti-streamer friendly game I've seen in a long while
[1:58:16] <Make_me_mad> Streamer Mode is a crime.
[1:58:19] <%HotSauceFiend> when dmca is the real thanos
[1:58:21] <amiavamp> medley medley medley trogdor
[1:58:28] <Dr_Mooose> still kinda cool, even though there's no music

[1:59:47] <+MrSammichMan> It's really such a shame, cause this scene was great with the music on. Really wish streamer mode populated the song list with duplicates of the Star-Lord songs rather than just turning it all off.

[2:27:56] <$Grimlockfly> I love Himbo Starlord
[2:27:56] <quantras6> @toptieramisu Drax is apparently a chad in the comics
[2:27:57] <$realm_forge> Wow this game got too real
[2:27:57] <@Ranryu692> It's astonishing how difficult a time people are having grasping that this game is in its own universe
[2:27:59] <%Valdorick> "That cop grabbed a spare unit laying around."

[2:28:32] <%greasypete00> this game is genuinely seeming interesting tho
[2:28:34] <nuane> is contraxia space weed?
[2:28:44] <NateyBeak> I hold things like that too
[2:28:46] <%kyh9> “CHECK THE COUCHES”, what is this Mégas XLR logic
[2:28:50] <%captainpodock> play more pls
[2:28:50] <Bigbossman91> @nuane it's a planet
[2:28:51] <Make_me_mad> This game is way better than it has any right to be. I hope more people give it some attention. It's no masterpiece but the writing is much better than most things that come out lately.
[2:28:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Will u do a full LP?
[2:29:08] <TonyBStreaming> @nuane Contraxia is space Vegas I think
[2:29:12] <%PrimalDweeb> You are Groot!
[2:29:19] <DXLelouch24> Pat its only 9 something, damn your old
[2:29:24] <rosemon5001> couldnt groot technically pollunate to make more of his race?
[2:29:30] <%PrimalDweeb> You get to hear both
[2:29:39] <quantras6> Like does Rocket actually understand what he's saying or is it just Rocket hangs out with him so much he can just figure it out?
[2:29:39] <+MackFighters> Groot clearly speaks Spanish
[2:29:39] <SomeAsianDood> @DXLelouch24 contracted to stream for a certain amount of time by square
[2:29:42] <+Rare_Ruiz> @DXLelouch24 I think the sponsorship only covers a certain amount of time.
[2:29:43] <+TopTieramisu> yo soy groot
[2:29:43] <%dekkitout> I mean, conjugations of irregular verbs are hard...
[2:29:55] <%MisterRockett> btw the reason Rocket is the only one who can understand groot is because most of it is lost in a high frequency only he can hear.

[2:31:27] <thenomad177> @saltmeisterr noooooooo
[2:31:32] <fishgul69> I like this bit. I live for story peppered in dialogue and stuff
[2:31:32] <%kyh9> “You’re a valuable member of the team, Spot”, “Bork Bork”

[2:32:18] <%Dakuu75> no idea
[2:32:18] <%PrimalDweeb> Yes
[2:32:19] <%kyh9> It has a name?????
[2:32:20] <TheBadoe> Yes
[2:32:23] <+ScrapKingKeita> They are Groot
[2:32:23] <+embranz> Yes
[2:32:24] <+TopTieramisu> LLAMA
[2:32:25] <scrumbotime> LLAMA
[2:32:27] <%dekkitout> I mean, sometimes he just strait up talks
[2:32:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yes
[2:32:29] <+foomaster22> What if his name isn't even Groot
[2:32:31] <+EdHeng> his name probably isn't even groot
[2:32:33] <%PrimalDweeb> You can, just not now.
[2:32:33] <%hereiam407> Eventually you can
[2:32:33] <%Anime_Flux> that llama is vibin
[2:32:34] <HeroToxiko> groot is a piece of yggdrasil so idk prolly
[2:32:35] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> The whole language sounds like that becuase of wood vocal cords
[2:32:36] <+Photonicfab> hes just vibing
[2:32:36] <%shurtal> you CAN pet it, eventually
[2:32:38] <ape_hawk> can... can you fuck it?
[2:32:38] <scrumbotime> This is where you cook the llama
[2:32:38] <TheBadoe> Yeah in the comics they're all named Groot
[2:32:40] <rytisone> microwave hallway
[2:32:40] <%Axellogic> The Llama is dancing to the Music that isnt playing
[2:32:41] <%chiazam> YES
[2:32:41] <SomeAsianDood> ITS THE SAVIOR OF THE LP
[2:32:42] <TonyBStreaming> You can pet him later
[2:32:42] <+Greenkap> theres a joke in x-men where jean grey can understand groot and hes incredibly well spoken
[2:32:42] <ape_hawk> i mean, it IS blue
[2:32:44] <@goose_attack_almanac> The explanation in the comments is that as Groots species matures their vocal cords harden so that's all they can audibly say.
[2:32:45] <JetpackMcQuack> Pure coincidence
[2:32:47] <ScreamLord> Watch the Llama be the final boss
[2:32:48] <+mcjimbo12> yeah i mean he's not actually saying "I am groot" right he's just making a noise that sounds like what we would right as "i am groot"
[2:32:48] <Dr_Mooose> just vibin lama
[2:32:49] <%Anime_Flux> awwww
[2:32:49] <rosemon5001> space toilet?

[2:36:16] <%NovaKnightmare> Square Enix clearly doesnt know what its doing regarding Marvel games
[2:36:17] <Arancet> gameplay still looks super meh, but dialogue is ok
[2:36:19] <%kyh9> THIS THING WAS WEIRDLY MARKETED PRE RELEASE

[2:36:34] <%AHomeschoolDropout> Is Boivan French for Marketing
[2:36:35] <%Dabrikishaw> Dabrikishaw subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! I get you Pat. I choose to stream Life is Strange True Colors with the music because it was a much lesser experience without it. The copyright hits to those videos was worth it.

This is one of those rare times where they shoved a thing in your face for 30mins @ E3 & everyone groans saying "OMG, GO AWAY!". Only for it to come out and it's actually pretty awesome. Have a great weekend!
