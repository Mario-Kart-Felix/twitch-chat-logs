[0:14:45] <%Mendin> Gief is doing the running bear suplex on Paige
[0:14:49] <%Frost_Quill> @VictorVonLouche That means they could have done that the whole time, they were just choosing not to.

[0:16:10] <scrumbotime> Yeah but a 14 year old won't try to unionize
[0:16:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> 14 year olds are NOT to be trusted
[0:16:13] <%CheesesSliced> I feel like the fact that cats eat earwax isn't getting enough airtime
[0:16:14] <$DocMadfox> Pat, that will not stop it.
[0:16:17] <+TheMilkiestShake> I think I've always been really smart and really cool also
[0:16:18] <%TheAntiNihilist> Wisconsin has low crime

[0:16:59] <%KineticZen> We need more wealth concentrated in the working class, which is why we need to tax capital gains as income
[0:17:00] <DomunDomunDomun> You can't stop us, Canadian man.
[0:17:00] <%Deekman> "don't be british"
[0:17:03] <scrumbotime> Run from england, that's the advice

[0:17:04] <%KineticZen> And institute a financial transcation tax
[0:17:06] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> The time to mock the British is upon us again!!
[0:17:06] <%VictorVonLouche> nah child labors only good if you continually abuse and condition them into basically robots from birth. You normally arrest those pedos that do this.

[0:18:12] <captain_elsewhere> @PatStaresAt ever heard of the giant worm monster from D&D called the riftmaw ? its got a portal to hell in its stomach causing unrelenting pain and the only way to stop it is for the creature to keep eating, i think gief may be a mini riftmaw in a dogs body
[0:18:13] <%blastyoboots> there we go
[0:18:14] <pennykettle_> My manager called me on Christmas Eve and I had to wait on the line to call them back for half an hour instead of hanging out with my family to tell them fuck off
[0:18:17] <Treasure_Vault> Pat would make an excellent prime minister
[0:18:20] <%CheesesSliced> Did you know that the British are a you hoax orchestrated by the government to help false the moon landing?
[0:18:20] <@CaptainPileDriver> my phone has a robot that scans the call
[0:18:22] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Then moon-walk out of the room
[0:18:24] <%dekkitout> "Fuckin yo hoe and stacking dough"
[0:18:26] <slix3431> Pat I got fired because my boss was stealing form the company and I asked too many questions
[0:18:30] <$realm_forge> My old boss used to time my bathroom breaks
[0:18:45] <pillowwasp> Just tell your boss you’ve been reading up on your french history
[0:18:46] <Daskolin> I just watched the worst case of mind goblins ever. Jesse Cox not using dagger in Inscription until game started throwing him cut-scenes with guy drawing a dagger. And he still didn`t use it lol
[0:18:51] <Mothraken> how long till we get a V-minister, or V-president?
[0:18:53] <+michingmallecho> "Can you come?" "Am I getting double pay?" "...so you want to lose your job" , and so on
[0:18:55] <ExpressNode> I wish I could not answer the phone but lets just saying not doing so actually fucks things up for a lot of people
[0:19:07] <+Frost_Trow> After sending my 2 week notice. They continued to call me after quitting for 4 weeks asking why I didn't show up to my shift LUL
[0:19:17] <%Valdorick> Act 3 is super weak.
[0:19:22] <%Treuan> Third act does fall kind of short
[0:19:22] <%Taisuru> Just beat Inscryption, I like the third act well enough
[0:19:25] <+metalicblackcherry> me too pat
[0:19:26] <theanora1> is Inscyption coming to PS4 or Switch?
[0:19:28] <+Re_Volta> mechanically?
[0:19:29] <%Mendin> It makes sense considering the context of act 3
[0:19:31] <LunarRemix> Yeah it's the least liked one
[0:19:31] <tanarath> That sucks
[0:19:31] <GhoulishCripple> @realm_forge sing him the old rhyme "you get a dollar, I get a dime. so i shit on company time"
[0:19:31] <Daskolin> Act 3 sucks =\
[0:19:33] <@Spydurman> I've 100% given up on it

[0:19:35] <%HollowedIdjit> Well that's disappointing
[0:19:35] <LucasTheDrgn> IIRC Pony Island also had a kinda weak ending as well
[0:19:35] <Manwad> 3rd act sucks its a real shame
[0:19:37] <insomniac_doze_> It grows on you
[0:19:38] <%Mendin> But the finale is worth it'
[0:19:38] <captain_elsewhere> gremlins elaS
[0:19:40] <$chance_h> It’s so tough
[0:19:41] <@CaptainPileDriver> when the game kills itself in the third act and ruins the whole game
[0:19:42] <+reaver93> Act 3 is the worst part, Act 4 is better
[0:19:43] <Man_in_the_Red> just the 3rd act, really now
[0:19:43] <@CaptainPileDriver> that suuuucks
[0:19:43] <+Kyma1020> that sucks. sorry man

[0:20:05] <fattydragon> I liked the demo and realized that I'm not into meta games so I stopped
[0:20:08] <%Treuan> There were a few places I got a little stuck
[0:20:09] <%holydeviant1> I want them to release, like, just act one as the card game on its own with more items, bosses, creatures, etc
[0:20:12] <Treasure_Vault> I hated act 2 because i chose poorly at the get go

[0:23:02] <%TheAntiNihilist> Golden Age Arc vs post GAA
[0:23:05] <%DedlokPM> Man the mob stuff is the best part of the Gungrave anime. The part that covers the actual game is nowhere near as good
[0:23:05] <MrPandastic> Oh god, Pat's going to try to play DD2. This might kill him.
[0:23:06] <%dekkitout> @vVAstrAVv The gang did steal some ww2 stuff like one time

[0:29:19] <pennykettle_> I've literally never wanted to damage my own property

Looking forward to all the new things it has in store! I sliced my fingers twice trying to cook Tika Masala today after saying "I take care of myself when I cook" to my friend. Feeling the embarrassment for real….
[0:29:26] <ExpressNode> I don't play fighting games but I have only tossed my controller twice ever
[0:29:30] <+Frost_Trow> JohnTron is the perfect example of not having friends to check your behavior
[0:29:31] <niddron> we talking about "rich black people commit more crime than poor white people?" Tron
[0:29:31] <@CaptainPileDriver> pat that's a lie
[0:29:32] <%Alazull> Remember that it's $200?
[0:29:32] <%Frost_Quill> God damn it I was convinced the "Jontron is racist" thing was a huge terrible joke since it came out of nowhere and he never said anything like that again.  But holy shit why.

[0:29:47] <niddron> That shit cost money
[0:29:47] <scrumbotime> Leave Jontron alone, in some sort of cave preferably.
[0:29:48] <Man_in_the_Red> i play a game like TF2, which kicks my ass into not caring

[0:30:11] <%SirGO0SE> you can shit your pants and cum but throw something, cmon
[0:30:12] <%CappuccinoGuil> People who do that were spoiled as kids and had the shit they broke replaced by their parents INSTANTLY.
[0:30:18] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Good advice. Thank you, Pat.
[0:30:20] <T_Sasquatch> @ghoulishcripple he's doing the exact same shit with covid
[0:30:23] <%CheesesSliced> *Leave Britney alone reference

[0:30:28] <@GeneralSCPatton> Throwing objects << Seething at the very concept of existence woolieFABRICATION
[0:30:34] <Xpisirage> Jontron has 400 broken controllers I bet

[0:30:48] <$velgaduere> @CheesesSliced you could not have made that less clear
[0:30:49] <%MegadBlitz> always take breaks. even from being cool
[0:30:49] <%TheMonstersDen> I played Mario kart with a guy who hurled his 3ds across the room when he got blue shelled. this man was in his twenties
[0:30:50] <%ConLin_Arts_> is Gief brave or does he get scared of silly stuff?
[0:30:51] <+Aniki_Tony> Zangeif is friendshaped
[0:30:51] <deviljhojho_> who, me
[0:30:55] <%Frost_Quill> The worst I do is hit my own thighs and scream when I'm home alone if I get that angry playing a game.  I can't imagine destroying something valuable holy shit.
[0:30:56] <+Allymac96> PLD looks so good in endwalker
[0:30:58] <MrPandastic> Gief looks like he's just about to pass out.
[0:30:59] <+Pendlez> chat you should also take breaks

[0:31:14] <slix3431> Pat what number do you hate the most?
[0:31:15] <tranquilturnip> @MrPandastic He always looks like taht
[0:31:15] <RushUnplugged> can I add people that waste food to the spoiled shitpeople to hate? as in, actually wasting food for dumb reasons (like making stupid videos)
[0:31:18] <deviljhojho_> i like how rotund zangief is
[0:31:19] <@CaptainPileDriver> i just love the big muscle gremlin sitting next to pat so much
[0:31:25] <%TheEvilOmega> I've gotten every class in FF14 up to 50. Kinda burned myself out on it a bit doing that in, like, two weeks. Already have a few at 80 and a couple at 70.
[0:31:30] <deviljhojho_> that should work perhaps
[0:31:33] <GhoulishCripple> @t_sasquatch so that's why he explicitly tweeted saying he's not saying to not get vaxed but that Fauci has been wrong? I'm not saying he did it well but he's not spouting anti vax shits he's against fauci being deified for being the face of the shot
[0:31:36] <MrPandastic> @tranquilturnip True.
[0:31:40] <tranquilturnip> like 31 I bet
[0:31:41] <deviljhojho_> YEAH FUCK EM
[0:31:41] <SergeMeist> it's just game, why you haff to be mad.  take a momentx leave the game and come back later

[0:31:47] <scrumbotime> 3
[0:31:48] <%Valdorick> IS ONE A PRIME NUMBER!?
[0:31:49] <+Pendlez> prime numbers are great
[0:31:49] <@CaptainPileDriver> 31 is great
[0:31:49] <%Frost_Quill> Because of the FFXIV raid?
[0:31:50] <%SlackerAlex> Is that just because of the ROBOT
[0:31:50] <homestylewaffles> you're just mad that One's not prime
[0:31:51] <$ItsRatman> 5
[0:31:51] <CivHistory> not even 5?
[0:31:51] <+D00msDayDan> dirtbag numbers
[0:31:52] <%twistedj3ster> prime numbers suck
[0:31:52] <%Puhff> ....but 5 is Prime????
[0:31:54] <deviljhojho_> Finally some sensible opinions
[0:31:55] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Mathbot loves you, huh.
[0:31:55] <$velgaduere> prime numbers killed my family
[0:31:56] <%afronooch> no
[0:31:56] <%TheEvilOmega> You hate those numbers, Pat? That's just PRIME.
[0:31:56] <lloyddboy> 1
[0:31:56] <+michingmallecho> Well isn't that just prime.
[0:31:58] <tranquilturnip> 53
[0:31:58] <$chance_h> 17 boo
[0:31:58] <+projectmanatees> No
[0:31:59] <tanarath> Prime numbers are alright
[0:32:01] <%SlackerAlex> No 1 is not
[0:32:02] <pennykettle_> If you played on separate PCs for House of Ashes, you'd explicitly have to not speak with eachother while you play because thats how the twist of Man of Medan is spoiled in the first 5 minutes, faster than Little Hope
[0:32:03] <%Frost_Quill> According to FFXIV no.
[0:32:03] <@Lion_kun> No
[0:32:03] <+barrakuta371> But I like number 117 becauze John Halo man
[0:32:04] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> 13 tho D:
[0:32:07] <%Garthunox> COMMENCING BOOT CAMP ROUTINE!
[0:32:07] <+Pendlez> prime numbers are why we can do encryption
[0:32:08] <+D00msDayDan> 1 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1
[0:32:08] <SaltyAzteca> Prime numbers are great. Theyre to the point, no variables. Just that one prime number
[0:32:08] <%furiousfurioso> that fucking 14 robot doesnt think so
[0:32:08] <homestylewaffles> according to Construct 8, 1 is not prime
[0:32:08] <@GeneralSCPatton> One is not prime, for complicated reasons ahving to do with Group Theory
[0:32:08] <joso_grando> sure
[0:32:09] <%justcallmebobplease> how about 2?
[0:32:09] <Psyramics> no? the answer is no
[0:32:10] <%afronooch> its not acording to my sticky note for FFXIV mechs
[0:32:11] <ExpressNode> A number that can only divide itself and by one?
[0:32:11] <@Lion_kun> It is not.
[0:32:11] <oda_flobunaga> No its not complicated at all
[0:32:14] <LucasTheDrgn> 1 is definitively not a prime number by any definition
[0:32:14] <+projectmanatees> in lighthouse its not a prime
[0:32:14] <CommanderFoxButt> Is zero an even number?
[0:32:15] <%Shikari21> Ffxiv told me it's not
[0:32:15] <+セビー> what has 11 ever done for me
[0:32:16] <%Deekman> Google says it's not
[0:32:18] <%BlackMage66652> MATH IS FOR DICTATORS
[0:32:18] <+transporterthesequel> Yeah but 7 is rad tho
[0:32:20] <T_Sasquatch> Its not. By definition of prime numbers
[0:32:21] <+Nkbzodiac> well yes, but actually no
[0:32:26] <AMajorTom> It’s not complicated. And no it’s not.
[0:32:29] <%Shikari21> Owww

[0:39:01] <Brandon__Brando> @Mendin oh yes

[0:39:08] <+RJay80> The first flame
[0:39:08] <tranquilturnip> we fucked up
[0:39:09] <tigerfang86> I mean killing an ancient god isn't generally A GOOD THING
[0:39:10] <Baljhet> this is canonically after a victory, I believe
[0:39:11] <%CappuccinoGuil> Have you even BEATEN DD1 Pat?
[0:39:11] <+aWanderingKaivo> sounds about right
[0:39:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> shits all fuckerd
[0:39:15] <LunarRemix> Yeah just keep repeating over and over again until DD2
[0:39:16] <+aWanderingKaivo> genre appropriate
[0:39:18] <Parapattern> Success was failure in the first game
[0:39:18] <deviljhojho_> i mean at least the world isnt over right now, right? tomatoSmile
[0:39:19] <slix3431> That's good lovecraft
[0:39:19] <%laserbeaming> You killed a new god, big deal. You're still doomed.
[0:39:23] <%lumporr> @MrPandastic i can't even imagine limmyTeeth
[0:39:23] <cheapdoc> The world's gonna end regardless
[0:39:23] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> You didn't win, you just postponed the loss
[0:39:24] <tanarath> Shit is ABSOLUTELY FUCKED
[0:39:24] <Treasure_Vault> This is the best timeline from Darkest Dungeon 1.
[0:39:26] <SaltyAzteca> Success? There's no success in madness LUL
[0:39:28] <RushUnplugged> shit's, as they say, fucked
[0:39:32] <Brandon__Brando> its basically what xcom did of lol you didnt win

[0:39:37] <%solracc25> Not good times
[0:39:41] <deviljhojho_> at least that jackass form the last game got a righteous asskicking tho
[0:39:41] <+ThePich> maybe the real Darkest Dungeon II was the friends along the way
[0:39:42] <Man_in_the_Red> i kinda assumed its a Xcom 2 senario where the vast majority of people failed their playthroughs and that became the canon events
[0:39:46] <cheapdoc> Man, this game is dark

[0:39:52] <+trizetacannon44> Is the game sound messed up for anyone else?
[0:39:52] <+aWanderingKaivo> Darkest Dungeon 2 is secretly a carriage racing game
[0:39:52] <MrPandastic> @lumporr Those fuckers always cheat. Salty bastards.
[0:39:53] <Treasure_Vault> Beating the entirety of 1 allows you to try a 2.
[0:39:54] <%dekkitout> Now THIS is cart racing
[0:39:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> none of these roads sound good
[0:40:00] <+lordericter> I mean the end of DD1 is very much a, you didn't win and cannot win.
[0:40:00] <Saltmeisterr> MY BOI
[0:40:01] <tigerfang86> HELL YES
[0:40:02] <Saltmeisterr> DISMAS
[0:40:04] <SaltyAzteca> IT LOOKS SO GOOD
[0:40:05] <Toni_Master43> It's 3d now
[0:40:05] <Questiy> It feels like the presentation comparison of Silent Hill 1 to Silent Hill 2; one is more literal while 2 is metaphorical
[0:40:07] <%TheEvilOmega> Wow, whoever made that crossroads sign must really hate the cities in every direction.

[0:40:20] <tigerfang86> don't SET HIM ON FIRE tho
[0:40:22] <$dmdyne99> BEING ON FIRE IS BAD
[0:40:24] <SaltyAzteca> HE LOVES FIRE
[0:40:24] <%bevyrage> early riser gives him a pseed bonus on first turn?
[0:40:26] <Brandon__Brando> thats a good fear
[0:40:26] <slix3431> He has the irrational fear of being burned alive
[0:40:27] <tigerfang86> he LOVES fire but not that much

[0:42:07] <ralphfromdk> HOW did he live?
[0:42:08] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Is Reynauld still a bastard kleptomaniac?
[0:42:11] <BlindGato> He's a GIGAchad
[0:42:12] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Dismas can step on me
[0:42:13] <%CheesesSliced> I just want everyone to know in advance that Pat is probably going to some something stupid
[0:42:13] <tigerfang86> I mean he made it but I don't think that's a good thing
[0:42:13] <moonmintparadise> AND REYNAULD IS NOT EVEN IN THE GAME YET 11
[0:42:13] <%holydeviant1> @Tennochief Maybe, but I hold out hope that the horny holds on
[0:42:15] <deviljhojho_> Dismas is a prince
[0:42:16] <%HollowedIdjit> Reynauld didn't make it
[0:42:16] <DomunDomunDomun> DILD
[0:42:17] <%Alazull> I like the idea that instead of Crusader you start with Man at Arms
[0:42:17] <Saltmeisterr> Reynauld is the one who died
[0:42:18] <%redthebaron> reynauld too
[0:42:18] <%CappuccinoGuil> All of them survive, don't they?
[0:42:19] <cheapdoc> This is a very wolf among us aesthetic for the shading
[0:42:20] <%Ipsenscastle> Dismas is a badass
[0:42:22] <SaltyAzteca> Reynauld and Dismas survived the final Dungeon
[0:42:24] <+lucaslaw2001> Reynauld is big dead btw
[0:42:24] <%baka_sugoi> Looks REALLY NICE
[0:42:25] <Meekest> Crusader and Vestal are gone
[0:42:27] <%Deft_Thought> @SaltyDavid Somebody had to be sacrificed in the last act
[0:42:29] <%Mendin> Reynaud is... why Dismas is alive
[0:42:29] <Sunstalker> Dismas? Dis Massive nuts kinamaHappyW
[0:42:30] <deviljhojho_> they really did find redemption
[0:42:30] <%Reaviar> reynauld sacrificed himself
[0:42:32] <Frogwash> Might wanna put yourself in the upper left for this one
[0:42:33] <pennykettle_> I barely know the lore for this game besides "lovecraftian"
[0:42:34] <%Taisuru> RIP Reynauld
[0:42:34] <%Deft_Thought> Reynauld is a true homie
[0:42:35] <WakeUpThrow> I'll miss hearing a whistle and my stuff disappearing right after  : (
[0:42:35] <%CappuccinoGuil> Dismas is RIPPED now
[0:42:37] <slix3431> F's in Chat for Reynault
[0:42:38] <SaltyDavid> damn it
[0:42:42] <$realm_forge> Is this Dark souls Oregon Trail?!
[0:42:42] <Brandon__Brando> OOOoooOOOoh fancy
[0:42:42] <%VictorVonLouche> Seems like there are no Knights in this game.
[0:42:43] <Tennochief> @holydeviant1 I want The Tusk too, friend
[0:42:46] <%baka_sugoi> Goth gf
[0:42:46] <SaltyAzteca> But then Reynauld died as he lived.
[0:42:49] <revoltingimp> F
[0:42:50] <lloyddboy> MAKE HER PAIGE
[0:42:50] <tranquilturnip> you would be too, in this reality
[0:42:53] <captwolfaroo> Lunge: the character
[0:42:53] <MarylandJutsu> YOOOO plague doctor got an UPGRADE
[0:42:54] <deviljhojho_> my wife
[0:42:56] <drunken_lemur> She
[0:42:58] <Baljhet> she
[0:42:59] <anAngryHamster> *she
[0:42:59] <Tennochief> she
[0:42:59] <+Arnoldoaad1> The animation is great with this style
[0:43:00] <%Mendin> Grave Robber just needs red hair and you could have Peach
[0:43:01] <tigerfang86> F for Reynault, stole his last treasure in the darkest dungeon
[0:43:01] <Essixian> SHE
[0:43:02] <axelkaspar> That's a she
[0:43:03] <%CappuccinoGuil> Where's my horny bi disaster vestal?
[0:43:05] <%laserbeaming> best girl
[0:43:06] <%CheesesSliced> Pat gets p0wnd
[0:43:08] <CatRidder> look pat more dishonored
[0:43:08] <Zebroneath> Lady Plague Doctor
[0:43:10] <Tennochief> yes
[0:43:10] <pennykettle_> booba
[0:43:10] <SunsetJack> Yes
[0:43:12] <@GeneralSCPatton> Yo, that is a fucking name for a physician
[0:43:12] <%dekkitout> Plague Doc was a lady in 1
[0:43:13] <%Alazull> Plague Doctors are women
[0:43:14] <slix3431> Is Plague doc a guy?
[0:43:14] <televisedrevolting> PD is your new healer now.
[0:43:15] <cheapdoc> I wonder why the crusader is not around
[0:43:15] <@MistyMntns> The Unusual Suspects
[0:43:16] <MarylandJutsu> Paracelsus does.....well was a male name
[0:43:17] <@MistyMntns> Jesus
[0:43:18] <%vivaldiva> graverobber waifu zoneGasm
[0:43:20] <%baka_sugoi> Gurl!?
[0:43:20] <%redthebaron> paracelsus the default name weird
[0:43:22] <SaltyAzteca> True, but PD is best doc
[0:43:22] <%lumporr> audrey seems out of place as a name
[0:43:23] <@MistyMntns> I love the crew names
[0:43:24] <deviljhojho_> yeah most people didnt know either back when DD launched
[0:43:24] <lloyddboy> SUS
[0:43:25] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Plague Doc is a lady
[0:43:25] <%holydeviant1> Maybe? It's less clear that the PD is fem this time
[0:43:26] <Treasure_Vault> Can you drift?
[0:43:28] <ralphfromdk> The change from "2d" to 3d is... kinda weird feeling
[0:43:33] <+actualemu> i never got into the first game, but the aesthetic going on right now is making me want to try again
[0:43:36] <captwolfaroo> Here's hoping Blinding Gas is still busted
[0:43:37] <%SharkMissile> @patstaresat yeee so stoked to see you play this!
[0:43:37] <wolfen091> this looks fantastic
[0:43:39] <Tennochief> Did you guys not look at the comics?
[0:43:41] <scrumbotime> Automatic Horse
[0:43:42] <Saltmeisterr> yes
[0:43:44] <SunsetJack> Yes, they drop loot
[0:43:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, get the Banana
[0:43:44] <%lumporr> BARRISTAN, DISMAS, PARACELSUS, and audrey
[0:43:45] <Saltmeisterr> they drop loot
[0:43:46] <+Pendlez> drift
[0:43:48] <%kainhighwind1990> This looks so great
[0:43:48] <televisedrevolting> Yes, they might have items.
[0:43:50] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> How does it control though?
[0:43:51] <+KingRipoff1> what mind goblin are we trying to kill today
[0:43:54] <%ScrapKingKeita> I recall hearing you're encouraged to hit them
[0:43:55] <+Pixel_Matt> monkaS
[0:43:56] <Brandon__Brando> I wonder if the abomination will be useful class at all this time
[0:43:59] <%thedankestmeeme> 24 Hour stream LETS GO PAT
[0:44:00] <+WeLucklessJacks> DEJA VU I'VE JUST BEEN IN THIS PLACE BEFORE

[0:44:24] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> How do you type with boxing gloves on
[0:44:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> I love that out of all the actual useful information in chat, Pat dials in on my bullshit.
[0:44:26] <captwolfaroo> Wayne sounding more quiet and reserved, and I'm into it
[0:44:40] <SunsetJack> So, are we allowed to share known info or let Pat be blind?
[0:44:47] <%CappuccinoGuil> Consumibles?
[0:44:49] <%bevyrage> are those AUTO USE ITEMS
[0:44:50] <TOONFOOD> hen party
[0:44:56] <%CoffeeKaiju> let pat be blind :)
[0:44:56] <%Taisuru> consumables

[0:45:18] <SaltyAzteca> Oh man stress counter is up to 10?
[0:45:19] <+mechslayer71> anyone know what the experimental version of DD2 does?
[0:45:21] <$ItsRatman> these new skill arts look great too
[0:45:26] <Saltmeisterr> its a self heal
[0:45:26] <@Velyndra> pat is always blind
[0:45:27] <%CoffeeKaiju> aaaaah now i sounds like a villain

[0:45:40] <cheapdoc> Pat Blinds At
[0:45:43] <Tennochief> should try out that Black Reliquary mod later
[0:45:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm still tripping that this game has legit driving controls
[0:45:52] <joso_grando> the game isnt out yet how are people backseating lol
[0:45:58] <Tenebrae94> i hope pat gets shambled
[0:46:09] <%holydeviant1> @joso_grando Actually...

[0:46:14] <Brandon__Brando> @joso_grando they find a way
[0:46:19] <SunsetJack> Throw shit out is good which is hilarious.
[0:46:21] <SaltyAzteca> Paid for in blood :)
[0:46:24] <royb2> Trinkets and baubels
[0:46:27] <doster504> @joso_grando cause someone did a 24 hour stream early so everyone already knows how to suck the fun out of it
[0:46:28] <tranquilturnip> Pat I have to pee can we hit a gas station
[0:46:29] <%dekkitout> Now I'm driving the bus!
[0:46:31] <%SharkMissile> Trinkets are used to purchase knick knacks
[0:46:32] <%Mendin> Good old Byrgenworth U
[0:46:33] <Tennochief> @joso_grando we've had years of sufferring to go through, we can inflict it on Pat
[0:46:35] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Never shake hands
[0:46:36] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Got it
[0:46:36] <arronash91> No crusader and vestel
[0:46:42] <%SharkMissile> knick knacks trade in for keepsakes
[0:46:46] <%RAWPowerStudios> God I'm so glad they kept the narrator. It would be so different.
[0:46:46] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Spit on them!
[0:46:47] <tranquilturnip> a lad

[0:47:31] <+leontalon> Eat mold
[0:47:33] <%Dkun4> Dkun4 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Hey Pat, man it's been a while since I had a chance to catch you guys live! If you have fun with Darkest Dungeon 2 would you consider going back to the original and downloading the mod to let you fight your wife live on stream?
[0:47:44] <MarylandJutsu> Your party said its my turn on the xbox
[0:47:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Can you crash?
[0:47:59] <+aWanderingKaivo> Audrey the space racist, except instead of aliens its lovecraftian monsters?
[0:48:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> The new style is probably gonna make modding a LOT harder, though
[0:48:03] <%Taisuru> are combat items consumed or reusable?
[0:48:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> You should try and crash
[0:48:11] <%SharkMissile> I wonder if there is gonna be traps in the leaves :o
[0:48:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> SOCIAL LINKS!?
[0:48:18] <Sunstalker> Dkun, he can do that already without installing the mod kinamaEz
[0:48:19] <joso_grando> now i drive the stagecoach
[0:48:21] <Brandon__Brando> im glad its a new spin on the game rather then just copy pasting it
[0:48:23] <ralphfromdk> we persona now
[0:48:24] <vavilonica> Social Lniks???
[0:48:24] <@Velyndra> wait do you get to drive the bus into the dungeon?
[0:48:27] <@Velyndra> heck yeah
[0:48:31] <@PlagueOfGripes> I hope this one is less assholish about trying to force you into losing no matter what
[0:48:31] <pennykettle_> @CappuccinoGuil Now that I see the game in action, I love the art, this is my only concern still
[0:48:35] <+secondkoan> @CappuccinoGuil I was thinking the same thing.
[0:48:38] <Essixian> DATING SIMULATOR LET'S GO
[0:48:39] <%solracc25> fire low?
[0:48:40] <%dekkitout> It's always about FAMILY
[0:48:41] <%Mendin> You get 5 skills now instead of 4, neat
[0:48:43] <televisedrevolting> Now I drive the stage coach to my death, children!
[0:48:43] <MarylandJutsu> Make out in the stage coach
[0:48:47] <scrumbotime> that's pretty neat
[0:48:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Time to make everyone kiss
[0:48:52] <$velgaduere> oh no, now he's writing fanfic of his doomed party
[0:48:56] <pennykettle_> It's like you're in a dungeon 100% of the time now
[0:48:58] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> What if they kissed under the carriage? Haha, jk, jk...unless?
[0:48:58] <SilverFaustX> u can breed now like ck3
[0:49:00] <Hydrapissed> ther is an option for the steering pat
[0:49:03] <SolidusA> drift
[0:49:05] <Baljhet> your party members can do a lot more than kiss in that thing
[0:49:07] <+the22cstomp> well yeah they're horses
[0:49:07] <%SharkMissile> When this stage coach is rocking, don't come a knocking
[0:49:08] <$chance_h> Can you drift?
[0:49:10] <MarylandJutsu> But what if you are the bad controls pat
[0:49:13] <pennykettle_> "your valley" I guess that answers your question
[0:49:15] <SilverFaustX> monkaSTEER
[0:49:20] <%Lizard0TM> you can just hold foward for the most part
[0:49:23] <TOONFOOD> is there zombie Oregon mechanics?

[0:50:01] <MarylandJutsu> doubel tap to AUTODRIVE
[0:50:03] <Hydrapissed> loathing make da fights harder
[0:50:04] <%holydeviant1> The best tip is to manage stress carefully, it's crippling

[0:52:24] <PwnyB> I saw it get suggested, but I never expected Pat to tackle the game that even I rage quit.
[0:52:25] <$ItsRatman> um is it just me or stress is out of ten not 100
[0:52:26] <%bevyrage> tiny pat should be moved to the top left for combat UI to not get blocked

[1:01:07] <%Mr_Pylon> Foetor one of those english words designed to trick people
[1:01:12] <$ItsRatman> Aw man look at dem nodes
[1:01:13] <LunarRemix> Holy shit this map is huge
[1:01:15] <cheapdoc> The first game was Xcom, this game is a roguelike
[1:01:16] <MarylandJutsu> dats a BIG MAP
[1:01:16] <+lucaslaw2001> Pretty sure that denial thing is a chapter select, so there will be like 5 chapters
[1:01:17] <LunarRemix> So many nodes
[1:01:18] <%baka_sugoi> PAD UP
[1:01:18] <Manwad> oh fuck a map, hell yeah
[1:01:21] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @drunken_lemur FTl is very overrated
[1:01:21] <SaltyDavid> Ayy Slay the Spire map
[1:01:22] <%TheGreatSkenardo> "fetor'
[1:01:23] <alxnotorious> omg that map
[1:01:25] <@GeneralSCPatton> That's a Slay the Spire right there
[1:01:25] <%Tarage> N O D E S
[1:01:25] <+WarbossMetal> huh, the map is like inscryption now
[1:01:28] <sirtommygunn> that's a long road
[1:01:29] <%StaceMcGate> the nap?
[1:01:35] <BlindGato> Wow this place looks like shit
[1:01:35] <drippinduckie> how long has he gotten in the game? how much is left?
[1:01:39] <nauskills> @drunken_lemur Maybe you're just bad at it Kappa
[1:01:43] <Baljhet> pat that's a bug
[1:01:44] <+queaks> I think Foetor is pronounced feetor
[1:01:50] <SilverFaustX> foetor means bad breath
[1:01:51] <fragdar> @PatStaresAt do you always prefer a controller because you are in a couch or do you genuinely prefer over mouse/keyboard in any game?
[1:01:53] <moonmintparadise> @drippinduckie he just started
[1:01:53] <%XelanArdel> slay the spire really inspired a lot of roguelites huh
[1:01:57] <%Tarage> Big left
[1:02:07] <HkxantII> I’d say since the two games are now rather different both can exist without replacing one another.
[1:02:08] <connieetc> Blue road mean road battle
[1:02:10] <%TheGreatSkenardo> It's all shitholes pat
[1:02:13] <MarylandJutsu> Is there any place in this game that ISNT A SHIT HOLE
[1:02:15] <%Taisuru> that seems like a input bug
[1:02:16] <tigerfang86> they all seem like shitholes pat
[1:02:19] <Sternieliscious> That's the One Piece Grand Line map.
[1:02:23] <Haarute> is it the "center on stagecoach" button that does that?
[1:02:23] <drippinduckie> @moonmintparadise  gotcha, thanks:)
[1:02:24] <Baljhet> the inns are nice
[1:02:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> Barristan is way too old for this shit.
[1:02:32] <%CheesesSliced> It's pronounced "fee-ter". It means stinky
[1:02:32] <+aWanderingKaivo> what is this the eastern plaguelands?
[1:02:34] <@GeneralSCPatton> I think it's pronounced like fetter and derived from fetid
[1:02:40] <Estuko> Mooom I'm hungryyyyyyy -Old veteran warrior and slayer of eldritch horrors.
[1:02:40] <bleugh> is this oregon trai
[1:02:42] <Zeif00> Big meat wall gotta eat

[1:03:45] <%CheesesSliced> By the way, that was a missed opting to call it the Paddy Wagon
[1:03:53] <+Dustwalker44> Damn it. I wasnt planning on buying this early access but now I am super tempted too.
[1:04:04] <chancho4tierra> DD1 has all the dept
[1:04:08] <%horsesaredumb> the artstyle will definitely make it harder to mod
[1:04:14] <@CreepyPorpoise> How are the gobobolins
[1:04:16] <captwolfaroo> DD1 is amazing, I'm glad they're not trying to do it again
[1:04:24] <moonmintparadise> @Dustwalker44 EGS has a coupon thing going on if you throw them some email for their newsletter. I got the game for 15 bucks lmao

[1:06:28] <captwolfaroo> I guess the stuff in the Dungeon got out
[1:06:29] <@CreepyPorpoise> this is a really strange aesthetic, but its good
[1:06:29] <%redthebaron> shit got fucked in the between the games
[1:06:30] <Manwad> the old gods has granted them WONDROUS GIFTS

[1:06:58] <joso_grando> holy shit dude
[1:06:58] <%Mendin> The tutorial wasn't kidding when it said Cultist Fights are High Risk High Reward
[1:06:59] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Party wipe time?
[1:07:00] <%SharkMissile> Narrator: Total misplay
[1:07:01] <%baka_sugoi> BIG mis
[1:07:02] <Estuko> @holydeviant1 They've been doing this cultist stuff for a VERY long time.
[1:07:02] <$realm_forge> Total misplay
[1:07:03] <kingra> Flesh angels? PogChamp
[1:07:06] <$ItsRatman> oh no they're reading our sins!
[1:07:08] <+FadingEmber> backseatting roguelite week LUL
[1:07:11] <%Mendin> Look at those evil flesh cherubs
[1:07:12] <Run44forrest> Run over
[1:07:14] <+BigbysBebop> why does it look like a mobile game now?
[1:07:14] <%bevyrage> are you sure?
[1:07:15] <nauskills> I love how the first enemy's sword is clipping through Man At Arms
[1:07:19] <%UvBenServed> psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab
[1:07:20] <+aWanderingKaivo> Barristan rocking it
[1:07:30] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> The world is going to hell, it makes sense that the cultists would be doing great
[1:07:31] <$realm_forge> I’d kill for a warhammer 40k mod of this
[1:07:38] <+pectusumbra> medicine
[1:07:39] <Visril> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[1:07:41] <SaltyDavid> Get enfebbled
[1:07:48] <fragdar> slice doesn't do bleed anymore??
[1:07:49] <Estuko> I love that their crowns look like the stress icons from the prior game.
[1:07:54] <%TheGreatSkenardo> or just warhammer
[1:07:57] <%Ipsenscastle> I'm really not a fan of the switch to 3d, it seems like a downgrade
[1:07:57] <+WarbossMetal> can't wait for dark souls/anime waifu mods for characters
[1:08:00] <%Jeemukun> why 40k and not just Fantasy
[1:08:07] <captwolfaroo> I'd kill for a DD mod of a Warhammer game
[1:08:07] <%Jeemukun> or Age of Sigmar
[1:08:10] <%SharkMissile> @estuko oh cool!
[1:08:11] <+セビー> the fartbus didnt prep them for miasma somehow, huh
[1:08:11] <Thomzzz> Wait did the game release!?
[1:08:12] <MrPandastic> @fragdar You're thinking of the other move.
[1:08:12] <WakeUpThrow> THe corrupted holy imagery makes me fear for Crusader and Vestal NotLikeThis
[1:08:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> Now THIS is Darkest Dungeon.
[1:08:17] <joso_grando> this looks amazing
[1:08:17] <olm46> If it was worse 3d, yes.
[1:08:18] <tranquilturnip> isn't this early access? it'll probably just get better
[1:08:18] <%afronooch> I didn't like it at first, but nah this rules
[1:08:20] <@SpaceCapnCrone> these models look great
[1:08:22] <+pectusumbra> It does look a bit different but I still dig it
[1:08:23] <%bevyrage> yeah it's a straight improvement with how they handled it
[1:08:25] <%CheesesSliced> Pat’s playing Darkest Dumbgeon
[1:08:25] <%HollowedIdjit> 40K mod of what?
[1:08:25] <moonmintparadise> @Thomzzz early access
[1:08:26] <$realm_forge> @jeemukun I’m a sucker for power armor
[1:08:26] <%dekkitout> There's a lot more character in this one
[1:08:28] <+froduck42> the only reason I'm not a fan of the 3d is that it's going to be harder to mod
[1:08:28] <%Ipsenscastle> it's just my opinion obviously
[1:08:32] <%anticrust> it seems likely
[1:08:33] <+lucaslaw2001> Now DD 1 looks weird with how little the characters are
[1:08:34] <brassmichaelmonkey> yeah this is amazing 2d to 3d
[1:08:35] <+Shaggnar> That's the fun part
[1:08:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> NOW we're playing Darkest Dungeon, baby
[1:08:36] <ZeeJiggle> Yeah I didn't even realize it was 3d until like, rotational movement.
[1:08:37] <cheapdoc> Dismas is 100% dying
[1:08:38] <PeteyMcPickle> I agree I think it's worse
[1:08:38] <+BigbysBebop> I dont like the ui
[1:08:38] <%baka_sugoi> he gonna be scared
[1:08:40] <%SharkMissile> C'moooooon heroic
[1:08:40] <Questiy> @Estuko They seem like mutated female cultists from DD1
[1:08:43] <+aWanderingKaivo> what if corrupted Reynald is a boss

[1:08:46] <TOONFOOD> dopest dungeon
[1:08:46] <MarylandJutsu> Maybe we should have run away Pat
[1:08:49] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> this game got an arc system works injection
[1:08:50] <Hydrapissed> TIME TO CRIT THE BED
[1:08:50] <+pectusumbra> well somebody gotta go
[1:08:50] <fragdar> tbh, a warhammer fantasy game in this style of gameplay in the end times period is a no brainer
[1:08:54] <Parapattern> I just liked the scetchy 2D style a lot more
[1:08:57] <ZeeJiggle> THAT DRAG ON HIS MACE, DUDE
[1:08:59] <SaltyDavid> This is the best transition to 3D i've seen from an indie game
[1:09:05] <%redthebaron> maybe dismas was wrong as shit
[1:09:06] <scrumbotime> oh no
[1:09:09] <+Shaggnar> HOW
[1:09:09] <MarylandJutsu> THEY HAVE DEATHS DOOR?
[1:09:09] <%Mendin> CRUSH, KILL, DESTROY. AEGIS REFLECTOR

[1:09:44] <+lucaslaw2001> ahhh the kill stealing begins
[1:09:45] <tranquilturnip> @セビー that's a pretty low bar
[1:09:45] <scarman125> yeah  she's a jealous bitch
[1:09:46] <Run44forrest> Yeah cause she likes murder
[1:09:46] <%Deft_Thought> High stress does that

[1:09:54] <%Ipsenscastle> @セビー haha you won't get any argument from me
[1:09:54] <%Axellogic> All I know about this game is that Absinthe is OP
[1:09:55] <%lumporr> @セビー i mean nothing compares to that. they completely ruined any chance that game had

[1:10:13] <cheapdoc> It's actually not going as bad as I imagined
[1:10:14] <%Mendin> 12 points of healing at level 2 is strong shit damn
[1:10:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> She's doing a scrubquotes
[1:10:15] <%Ganerumo> Ganerumo subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! man the 3D stuff is really well used
[1:10:19] <SunsetJack> High stress causes them to be iratated lol
[1:10:26] <%SharkMissile> Battlefield medicine now limited uses tomatoDisgust
[1:10:31] <%redthebaron> big stress

[1:12:52] <SunsetJack> High Stress = Bad Mood

[1:12:54] <%SharkMissile> Friendship ended with AUDREY. Dismas is my new bro
[1:12:54] <%Mendin> Oh right she loves death, so the fact that she isnt causing it is miffing her I guess
[1:12:58] <fragdar> literally the only reason someone could argue this 3d is bad, is because now its harder to make waifu mods for the game like in dd1
[1:12:58] <%baka_sugoi> Goth GF need KILL
[1:13:02] <+FadingEmber> Oh good, shipping too. Didn't think DD could get more toxic. Kappa
[1:13:06] <Saltmeisterr> YOU
[1:13:09] <Hydrapissed> wow rare trink
[1:13:11] <Saltmeisterr> YO
[1:13:12] <Hydrapissed> WOW got both
[1:13:14] <dubstep_paladin> the cherub was holding a scroll like Reynauld in DD1
[1:13:15] <moonmintparadise> @Tarage because the grave blocks the position, which makes enemies stay in certain spots and resistant to certain attacks
[1:13:15] <%lumporr> "ch'yeah bro you saw how i killed that thing?" "ch'yeah bro that was so hot"
[1:13:17] <+ewigengeist> Nice!
[1:13:18] <Saltmeisterr> LUCKY DROP
[1:13:20] <Hydrapissed> 40 perent hp holy shit
[1:13:21] <%TheGreatSkenardo> music seems good
[1:13:25] <Man_in_the_Red> @fragdar that sounds like a positive to me
[1:13:26] <MarylandJutsu> Except or Tank is SO STRESSED
[1:13:28] <Hydrapissed> thats huge
[1:13:32] <@GeneralSCPatton> They're basically Johnathon and Speedwagon. Full-on bromosexuals
[1:13:34] <%SharkMissile> Dude totally worth it
[1:13:37] <%Mendin> So Dark Impulse basically means a Cultist Trinket is 2-slots for Big Buff
[1:13:38] <%Tarage> Big wounded
[1:13:41] <drippinduckie> old pat kinda looks like that guy
[1:13:46] <anAngryHamster> @fragdar Some of those horny mods were more distressing than anything in theactual game
[1:13:46] <%redthebaron> that is a lot
[1:13:48] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> the loathing abides
[1:13:50] <%Mendin> Big & Strong
[1:13:55] <Rionxgarland> is this still 2d cause it looks like pseudo 3d
[1:13:55] <moonmintparadise> he is grooving
[1:13:57] <Hydrapissed> that is a lot

[1:14:04] <%Mendin> Can you feed him some moss right now to heal?
[1:14:06] <scrumbotime> 40% but you can't equip anything else
[1:14:07] <$ItsRatman> 40% means nothing if he dies of heart attack :(

[1:16:54] <%VictorVonLouche> He's bantering he lost stress there
[1:16:56] <LunarRemix> I think this system is so that you don't keep heroes at 9/10 Stress and try to keep it as low as possible
[1:16:56] <anAngryHamster> Remember to try out the buffing moves
[1:17:05] <Hydrapissed> DEATHS door

[1:17:40] <Essixian> PAT PLEASE HEAL NotLikeThis
[1:17:41] <%CappuccinoGuil> @PatStaresAt You were timed in DD1 as well, it just wasn't like this.
[1:17:41] <scrumbotime> if fights go on too long, its probably like DD 1, stresses you out so you can't farm healing skills
[1:17:47] <Haarute> "we'll DIE before we use a healing ability"
[1:17:48] <%Esparsenior> HEAL
[1:17:49] <LunarRemix> Pat you can heal him
[1:17:56] <Goergorion> What happens at the end of the time?
[1:17:59] <@GeneralSCPatton> I guess the timer is to prevent strats where you spam heals and torch boosters
[1:17:59] <SolumFuturae> richkidMentor mentors in chat
[1:18:01] <cheapdoc> I'm guessing he wants to test the limits of the game?

[1:23:40] <Chaossheep> that's protection, it shows you how much damage it would have done (grey number) and how much damage you did (red number)
[1:23:43] <%Tarage> @PatStaresAt You coulda done 7 but it went down to 4.
[1:23:44] <%MelBrooksKA> What gobos is Pat slaying?

[1:28:48] <Baljhet> "misses the mark" is a trait that has a chance to apply Blind.

[1:36:22] <+braincraft> Aurey is a Karen.
[1:36:26] <%animaturgy> this sequel looks FANCY
[1:36:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh Pat, you are only going to WISH this was the end. Time for 3 more Battles of slowly crawling toward your death.
[1:36:29] <Hydrapissed> DONT KS
[1:36:30] <zenith0111> KILL STEALER
[1:36:34] <%SinnerEbru> damn audrey is FULL of salt
[1:36:35] <%Daxalog> How is it easier to understand?
[1:36:40] <%lumporr> how do people do a positive relationship? everything is negativo
[1:36:42] <moonmintparadise> H E A L
[1:36:42] <%Deft_Thought> I think the Plague Doctor has anti-stress skill
[1:36:44] <%CheesesSliced> Just heal your people, Pat
[1:36:45] <moonmintparadise> thanks..
[1:36:49] <%MrUnKnownAlien> they are all like babies

[1:36:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> @lumporr Don't have everyone at maxed stress all the time helps LUL
[1:37:01] <DancesWitBalrog> These ppl are assholes LUL
[1:37:04] <%baka_sugoi> body GONE
[1:37:04] <connieetc> Normally you win and get positive relationships, idk what happened tho
[1:37:07] <%ScreamLord> Darkest Dungeon 2: Everyone is Butthurt
[1:37:09] <%CheesesSliced> HEAL PEOPLE!
[1:37:10] <+chiazam> Audrey has taken like NO DAMAGE
[1:37:13] <Baljhet> there are ways to keep your group positive, and if you do it right, it makes the game way more manageable
[1:37:16] <zenith0111> Now that Dismas died this party will start to be friends
[1:37:17] <HkxantII> If anything 100 stress is easier to manage than 10. More room for messups
[1:37:25] <fragdar> wait.. dismas died??? i look the other way for 3 seconds
[1:37:25] <%lumporr> @CommanderSqueaks just like real life!
[1:37:26] <+aWanderingKaivo> I like how the poison damage makes fart noises.

[1:37:39] <Hydrapissed> she is maid in hell
[1:37:40] <+b_bang_> how do you get new people in this game?
[1:37:49] <%Deft_Thought> @lumporr It's because the characters all have high stress. It compounds by building into negative relationships instead of positive
[1:37:50] <%Ipsenscastle> this guy has a bad case of Ludwig face
[1:37:51] <CoupleAGuys> Nothing is more horrible than a bucket
[1:37:51] <V0LK__> damn, RIP dismas T_T

[1:38:31] <CoupleAGuys> Maybe hell come back
[1:38:31] <%Tarage> BIG STRESS
[1:38:31] <+FadingEmber> DD is all about your party becoming horrible people who are hard to deal with. The shorter runs don't seem to be helping with that.

[1:44:36] <DanThePumpkinman> gotta say, fucking love the idea of adding s links to this game
[1:44:45] <tigerfang86> make your characters DATE
[1:44:49] <%redthebaron> we learned it
[1:44:52] <DanThePumpkinman> makes the characters feel unique
[1:45:03] <the_walkin_dude_19> and they kiss now..? :)
[1:45:04] <+secondkoan> Surprised one of these Darkest Dungeon monsters haven't appeared in Dead by Daylight. The cast of protagonists would be dope in there as playable characters too.
[1:45:07] <tigerfang86> LMAO
[1:45:08] <Hydrapissed> Clap
[1:45:08] <+Shaggnar> LUL
[1:45:13] <cheapdoc> I mean, the characters are unique now
[1:45:14] <%dekkitout> All my homies hate Audrey
[1:45:19] <%baka_sugoi> ye
[1:45:20] <Omiba98> the relationship system makes for some crazy tales
[1:45:21] <%TheGreatSkenardo> What if Audrey'
[1:45:21] <%emMmDeeKay> Girlbosses don't get along
[1:45:27] <%baka_sugoi> THOT SLAIN
[1:45:27] <CoupleAGuys> I dont remember grave robber being that cool in the first game, so thats fine
[1:45:34] <2shidded> reading cant save you now
[1:45:35] <Estuko> @secondkoan a whle ago i held my finger for a Nazghul to be a killer. but eh
[1:45:36] <Hydrapissed> its okay u got flapjacks doe
[1:45:38] <scrumbotime> so full stress is BAD not "maybe bad maybe good"
[1:45:38] <%TheGreatSkenardo> What if Audry's hat was much smaller
[1:45:38] <zenith0111> It also makes the GOOD characters seem WAY better by making the negatives so huge
[1:45:39] <+aWanderingKaivo> what IF Audrey
[1:45:40] <%CheesesSliced> Audrey=Karen
[1:45:43] <Woodywoo0100> are their different character traits each run?
[1:45:43] <captwolfaroo> Can you rename Audrey to pretend she's not a b?
[1:45:46] <sirrice77> @secondkoan DD is just an indie game, a popular one, but it doesn't have the same draw as like all the horror icons
[1:45:52] <Baljhet> it's exp based
[1:45:53] <%Daxalog> So the first 5-20 rounds arent even real then?
[1:45:56] <Goergorion> and characters
[1:45:56] <jmft2000> No Virtue?
[1:45:59] <+pectusumbra> depends on how rougelike they want it
[1:45:59] <WakeUpThrow> Wow that's a lot of unlocks
[1:46:00] <Woodywoo0100> *There, shit
[1:46:06] <%ScrapKingKeita> you can slightly increase your points by abadoning trinkets
[1:46:10] <%Mendin> It said "Hope Restored" which I guess it a mixture of combats and distance and enconters
[1:46:15] <%CheesesSliced> Audrey wants to see the manager
[1:46:20] <zanzibarian_hamster> So there's no "end", you have to die?
[1:46:21] <scrumbotime> ohhh so if your Highwayman dies, you have no more highwaymen that run
[1:46:26] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt Upgrading the plague doc's prep skill lets helps  with managing stress
[1:46:29] <%Aleate> Profile unlocks. Like Flapjacks
[1:46:29] <Baljhet> correct
[1:46:34] <tigerfang86> more Roguelight for sure
[1:46:35] <iacus_> pure
[1:46:38] <SunsetJack> @patstaresat Discarding items also progresses the hope bar so toss unwanted items.
[1:46:41] <@Lion_kun> Wouldn't dying after a longer journey remove hope?
[1:46:42] <+anzelwhite> anzelwhite subscribed with Prime. 
[1:46:46] <+secondkoan> @secondkoan That would have been fire @Estuko. And yeah, I can see that @sirrice77. Audrey for the next monster in Dead by Daylight tho, lmao.
[1:46:53] <iacus_> wasnt the first game a roguelite as well?
[1:46:55] <CoupleAGuys> I like that I dont have to care as much about my party dying, because they'll just be back next run
[1:46:57] <ZeeJiggle> It's a pretty different game, which is great because it doesn't make the first obsolete.
[1:46:58] <+pectusumbra> I mean you still helped people along the way
[1:47:01] <%ScreamLord> But Pancakes tho
[1:47:02] <%redthebaron> they did help a lot of people on the way
[1:47:12] <%Daxalog> First game was just a Tactics game with a Strategy layer
[1:47:12] <@GeneralSCPatton> @lion_kun The hope comes from the perceived possibility of success
[1:47:13] <Hydrapissed> or did u even die O0O0O0O0 spooky
[1:47:19] <Baljhet> the first game was more of a campaign, like XCOM.
[1:47:20] <%Mendin> is Denial the only origoin?
[1:47:25] <doster504> @secondkoan You can't sell NFT's of Audrey tho so dbd doesn't care
[1:47:31] <slix3431> No town?
[1:47:32] <%TheMonstersDen> the true darkest dungeons was the enemies we made along the way
[1:47:32] <%solracc25> stress buildup is too aggressive.
[1:47:34] <tanarath> I like unique characters
[1:47:36] <@Lion_kun> Okay, I just figured spirit ls being broken.
[1:47:40] <+Ellila> The one thing I don't personally vibe with is the lack of a hub you upgrade.
[1:47:44] <PeteyMcPickle> Is there no town in this?
[1:47:45] <+Dustwalker44> ohyou can change their names!
[1:47:45] <the_walkin_dude_19> THOSE ANIMATIONS
[1:47:48] <huskarl_zap> Barristan is like "The Empire."
[1:47:48] <%redthebaron> i liked the dungeon crawling but other that this seems great
[1:47:48] <zenith0111> The improved art helped a lot
[1:47:52] <Hydrapissed> more damage
[1:47:53] <+pectusumbra> It's cool but it's also different so I wouldn't compare them directly
[1:47:54] <captwolfaroo> Very different game, though
[1:48:00] <+reaver93> weakened
[1:48:03] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> I think the first game is gonna have a stronger modding scene
[1:48:05] <iacus_> is it the same character?
[1:48:05] <%VictorVonLouche> Take more damage
[1:48:05] <kingra> This game is definitely early access but It definitely has promise
[1:48:07] <+reaver93> he takes more damage
[1:48:11] <LucasTheDrgn> The Yips
[1:48:11] <Saltmeisterr> +50% dmg taken
[1:48:13] <iacus_> didn't they die?
[1:48:15] <%ScreamLord> The fuck is "The Yips"?
[1:48:17] <%stoatacious> good to see dismas again
[1:48:17] <Chatterbox1991> Is this 3D or 2D? it's hard to tell
[1:48:18] <+Chimeraelite> G pulls it up
[1:48:26] <+aWanderingKaivo> seems like they could do a better job with all the symbols
[1:48:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Holy shit
[1:48:28] <%redthebaron> oh wow
[1:48:28] <@Lion_kun> DD2 is a much purer roguelike huh
[1:48:30] <CoupleAGuys> Wouldve expected crusader to be available at first, considering the first game.
[1:48:31] <tigerfang86> oh man
[1:48:32] <Hydrapissed> yes
[1:48:34] <Mythematical> Are the DLC characters in? Is Flagellant Around?
[1:48:34] <%TheGreatSkenardo> Little mad about how Barristan is constantly short-hafting his morningstar
[1:48:35] <Hydrapissed> dd1 had that
[1:48:35] <%baka_sugoi> cool
[1:48:36] <%ScrapKingKeita> Yep
[1:48:36] <ZeeJiggle> Fun
[1:48:37] <+pectusumbra> First game had things like that as well
[1:48:37] <+sixcubit> that was how it was in the first game too
[1:48:38] <%dekkitout> Which comp was the backstabbers LUL
[1:48:41] <%Ipsenscastle> I'm the exact opposite but that's a good thing, the two games seem aimed for very different kinds of players
[1:48:42] <zanzibarian_hamster> Thats how it was in 1 too
[1:48:42] <PeteyMcPickle> Yeah same in the 1st game
[1:48:43] <Woodywoo0100> @chatterbox1991 Its 3D
[1:48:46] <%ScrapKingKeita> I remember in DD1, if you ran with 4 crusaders, it was "The Last Crusade"
[1:48:49] <%MugenSandan> FF13 eat your heart out psaGoblin
[1:48:49] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt it's something they added later in the original game too
[1:48:52] <iacus_> @Chatterbox1991 looks like 3d with handpainted textures
[1:48:53] <%stoatacious> is the crusader in this as well? I want to see reynauld again
[1:48:54] <captwolfaroo> That was a thing in DD1 too
[1:48:55] <Saltmeisterr> point blank inspection LUL
[1:48:58] <WakeUpThrow> First game didn't have one for EVERY team comp, though
[1:49:03] <AllenDeadman> do we need audrey?
[1:49:03] <%VioletHeart> People already said it but yeah, DD1 had team names too.
[1:49:07] <mrblitzstream> Damn that looks sooo cool
[1:49:09] <+Chimeraelite> First mod that's comingout for this is gonna let you take multiple
[1:49:11] <%Ganerumo> The first game had a combination named RED HOOK but I can't remember what it was
[1:49:14] <Chatterbox1991> @Chatterbox1991 @Woodywoo0100  yoooooooo
[1:49:15] <+pectusumbra> that is true
[1:49:25] <PeteyMcPickle> So is this game basically, the adventurers from the first game failed and the world went to shit?
[1:49:30] <CommanderFoxButt> I love highwayman rank 1 because of point blank shot start
[1:49:31] <Chatterbox1991> @iacus_  thats cool
[1:49:31] <bijushu> whats the other characters in the game
[1:49:33] <%redthebaron> i wish the cart owuld just drive it self unless it needs my input
[1:49:34] <Saltmeisterr> @Ganerumo lemme check
[1:49:36] <Kain5707> it will once its on steam
[1:49:48] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @PeteyMcPickle they won, but it only delayed the inevitable
[1:49:53] <Hydrapissed> Clap HES DED
[1:49:53] <+Ricky_Rexx> ouch
[1:49:54] <Essixian> @PeteyMcPickle The adventurers from the first game SUCCEEDED and the world went to shit anyway
[1:49:54] <AllenDeadman> wat
[1:49:54] <scrumbotime> So he fights harder, but he takes a big hit
[1:49:55] <%baka_sugoi> BIG
[1:49:56] <+Shaggnar> Nice
[1:49:56] <slix3431> @PeteyMcPickle No the adventurers won and the world still went to shit anyway
[1:49:57] <+reclines_obesily> the cart can drive itself if you want
[1:49:58] <%StaceMcGate> REMOVE THIS DUDE
[1:49:59] <WakeUpThrow> @PeteyMcPickle Apparently the first adventurers won, and the world STILL went to shit
[1:50:01] <%redthebaron> he is a peacemaker
[1:50:01] <+Chimeraelite> I mean the Hamlet is only a small slice of the world. They didn't fail, but there's WAY more crazy out there
[1:50:01] <%Mendin> But a permanent +10% damage
[1:50:03] <%MugenSandan> @peteymcpickle Actually the adventurers from the first game SUCEEDED and the world went to shit
[1:50:04] <tigerfang86> His lifestyle DETERMINES HIS DEATHSTYLE pat
[1:50:04] <+aWanderingKaivo> ouch
[1:50:05] <moonmintparadise> better do DEFEND right away
[1:50:06] <+pectusumbra> Use other skills besides crush you ginger goblin man
[1:50:09] <meepes> Oh no Darkest Dungeon got bought by EA Aaaah
[1:50:09] <BlindGato> It's a good thing he has defense options
[1:50:10] <PeteyMcPickle> Ah shit, that's pretty cool
[1:50:12] <+Chimeraelite> Better open with Bolster then
[1:50:12] <cochramd1992> better put defense items on him
[1:50:14] <+Ricky_Rexx> The models look so good!
[1:50:15] <CoupleAGuys> He turned his tank stance off to do more damage
[1:50:19] <+aWanderingKaivo> YIP YIP
[1:50:23] <moonmintparadise> SHE GOT BAD EYES LMAO
[1:50:24] <%Mendin> Give him the +Speed trinket and have him use his block skill turn 1 ezpz
[1:50:26] <%laserbeaming> Looks like Paracelsus is a Kobold

[1:53:19] <%CheesesSliced> Please remember to mediate allies
[1:53:23] <+aWanderingKaivo> swimmingly
[1:53:25] <CoupleAGuys> Okay pat, you should have everyone give each other massages or something so they dont kill each other.
[1:53:29] <Hydrapissed> u shook brah
[1:53:32] <+Huttersson> Or is it an instance where these dudes are stuck in an endless loop of attempts or something?

[1:54:22] <%CheesesSliced> Medication = mediation though...
[1:54:22] <moonmintparadise> it only works on second row
[1:54:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Maybe more heal
[1:54:42] <Demon_chann> is this bloodborne kart?
[1:54:46] <dan_g_v> Dismass is still alive?!

[1:54:50] <%baka_sugoi> H EA L
[1:54:51] <%stickygumbolee> stickygumbolee subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Wish I was better at consistently resubbing, but after 8+hours of staring at screens for work, its the last thing I want to do when I get home. Pet the babbins for me!
[1:54:53] <huskarl_zap> pat in the house without his soul stone kek
[1:54:53] <SunsetJack> Isn't bolster stress relief also or am I thinking of something else lol

[1:55:08] <Baljhet> bolster is a stress heal, yeah
[1:55:10] <Saltmeisterr> Plague's rightmost skill upgraded manages stress very well
[1:55:12] <%afronooch> MILK
[1:55:13] <slix3431> The world is doomed. Capitalism is dead
[1:55:15] <cheapdoc> Cures blindness
[1:55:15] <televisedrevolting> Does Ounce of Preservation heal Stress or am I misremembering?
[1:55:16] <%CheesesSliced> Don't forget to bring a towel
[1:55:16] <Manwad> mmmm malk

[1:55:28] <RokosModernBasilisk> nyannPOG
[1:55:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Milk is a base, it negates Acidity.

[1:55:31] <%baka_sugoi> MILK EYES
[1:55:35] <CoupleAGuys> You need milk for when the enemies tear gas you
[1:55:36] <Parapattern> Can I get an Iced Latte with...
[1:55:37] <+aWanderingKaivo> the eye bones
[1:55:39] <+blue_twitch> milk's a solid investment, it'll never go bad
[1:55:40] <%CheesesSliced> For a lactose crit
[1:55:41] <+AlucardX60> The ancestor sounds a little more depressed in this game.
[1:55:45] <Sternieliscious> I very much misheard the word milk.
[1:55:53] <%Ipsenscastle> all the best adventurers can lactate into their own eyes
[1:56:04] <%CheesesSliced> +10 milk damage

[1:56:57] <+pectusumbra> damn right
[1:57:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> Dismas looks like he's already having a time.
[1:57:09] <Baljhet> cards might be the best way to do that, if you're lucky
[1:57:15] <+Ricky_Rexx> @CoupleAGuys I mean he's been through the most hasn't he?

[1:58:52] <Treasure_Vault> I dunno, FTL is neat cause you can do dumb shit like pause before the missiles hit and pump your engines to max
[1:58:56] <Manwad> making out with the beak

[1:59:02] <+Ricky_Rexx> Friends?

[2:01:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> Stack those DOTs, Pat, stack those fucking DOTs

[2:02:12] <%vivaldiva> DoT stacking in DD1 fucking ruled
[2:02:13] <zanzibarian_hamster> It was the most broken shit in DD1, they REALLY nerfed how busted the plague doctor used to be

[2:02:39] <%laserbeaming> Barristan is adorable
[2:02:43] <%Ixiah> the real Darkest dungeon was the friendship we made along the way
[2:02:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> Having a team member who is good at making friends seems like a MAJORLY beneficial perk in this game, actually
[2:02:45] <sirrice77> For friendship? we shounen now?
[2:02:50] <Carlioo> I love how they fling away the bottom after using it
[2:02:51] <Manwad> wait do they have 5 skills now?

[2:03:20] <Hydrapissed> prob fixed
[2:03:28] <%Mendin> More than directly, even
[2:03:29] <+Rosy_Joan> oh yeah these guys fucking tonight
[2:03:31] <%CheesesSliced> S links are actually the noisy important stat
[2:03:36] <Skeletonmanners> this will directly affect the fishing season
[2:03:54] <+aWanderingKaivo> nice, net of -25% dmg?
[2:03:56] <%CheesesSliced> Dogpile tonight
[2:04:12] <%Mendin> Synergy

[2:04:25] <%baka_sugoi> ZOMBIE PARTY
[2:04:31] <scrumbotime> yep they canceled out nice
[2:04:32] <%TheGreatSkenardo> and then there's these bitches
[2:04:34] <+pectusumbra> sure we take those
[2:04:35] <CoupleAGuys> That works
[2:04:36] <Hydrapissed> they knew
[2:04:38] <%baka_sugoi> NICE
[2:04:42] <%Mendin> Just a quartet of zambinis, kick their asses
[2:04:42] <%dekkitout> Neat
[2:04:42] <tigerfang86> WORKS FOR ME
[2:04:45] <dan_g_v> pro strats
[2:05:06] <+pectusumbra> good hit!
[2:05:07] <%CoffeeKaiju> bonk
[2:05:12] <tigerfang86> VIOLENCE
[2:05:13] <DanThePumpkinman> is the light level still a thing in this one? less light=harder fights etc?
[2:05:13] <%baka_sugoi> BIG DAMG
[2:05:16] <scrumbotime> This is the power of Bros
[2:05:18] <%horsesaredumb> I love the timed mechanic like Xcom Enemy Within, much more interesting
[2:05:20] <moonmintparadise> good run
[2:05:21] <+aWanderingKaivo> look at all these basic zombs
[2:05:22] <slix3431> This is WAAAAAAY easier than the other zone
[2:05:24] <%CoffeeKaiju> why is there a round limit tho
[2:05:26] <%Mendin> I like the flavor too: Daredevil boosts his damage but weakens his defense since he's rushing in blindly, but with the banner, he's rushing in as Leader Vanguard so he's defending
[2:05:30] <Baljhet> light level exists, but less light is objectively bad in this one
[2:05:30] <+Huttersson> I wonder if that is cause they have exactly matching, countering modifiers, or if they would cancel even if they weren't the same?
[2:05:35] <%dekkitout> Yippe
[2:05:35] <olm46> Lucky Joe
[2:05:35] <+Chosington> YIPYIP
[2:05:41] <dashwallkick> it's rad that we can see Pat discovering the cool part of Darkest Dungeon 1 without the Mind Goblins
[2:05:41] <%ScreamLord> WTF is the Yips?
[2:05:51] <Baljhet> I believe Vulnerability and Block directly cancel
[2:05:51] <+Ricky_Rexx> The second you said "He;s got the yips" my dog starting yipping wtf
[2:06:01] <+pectusumbra> @CoffeeKaiju it's to keep you from stalling things out.
[2:06:04] <%TheEvilOmega> I know what the yips is.
[2:06:04] <%CoffeeKaiju> i think it just meants they're jumpy
[2:06:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ScreamLord "The yips are involuntary wrist spasms that occur most commonly when golfers are trying to putt. However, the yips can also affect people who play other sports "
[2:06:05] <+aWanderingKaivo> its how you summon a sky bison
[2:06:08] <+Huttersson> So a +10% would completely cancel a -20%.
[2:06:11] <zanzibarian_hamster> Yips is a baseball thing where people suddenly lose the ability to throw
[2:06:11] <CoupleAGuys> You missed a tombstone
[2:06:12] <%Mendin> The yips are an involuntary wrist spasm disorder
[2:06:13] <%holydeviant1> Baseball turn for getting nerves in early game
[2:06:13] <mrblitzstream> LUL LUL LUL
[2:06:14] <%stoatacious> lotta yips and yiff is in this game
[2:06:14] <zanzibarian_hamster> No known cure
[2:06:15] <%CheesesSliced> Yips is performance anxiety
[2:06:17] <zanzibarian_hamster> Legitimately
[2:06:19] <+SwipperSwapper> basically your afraid of balls in your face
[2:06:19] <%Ipsenscastle> the Yips is performance-based anxiety basically
[2:06:20] <+mczarklesby> The Yips is a thing from darts/other throwing sports. It's like stuttering but for throwing shit.
[2:06:20] <Arancet> involuntary wrist spasms
[2:06:21] <%TheEvilOmega> It's a mental think in sports where a person just kinda... lose the ability to play.
[2:06:24] <TrollKing96> Can you turn off corpses like in DD1
[2:06:36] <%Mr_Pylon> Involuntary wrist movements... huh
[2:06:41] <%ScreamLord> Thank you Chat
[2:06:41] <scrumbotime> PAIGE RISES

[2:07:56] <DanThePumpkinman> LOVE EACH OTHER
[2:08:02] <qo_op> ❗
[2:08:02] <@Ranryu692> woah, this game is in 3D?
[2:08:07] <General_Terro> fambly
[2:08:10] <SilverFaustX> its FE
[2:08:10] <Not_Paladin> So is this just Miitopia + Darkest Dunegon?
[2:08:11] <CoupleAGuys> Renault is a ho
[2:08:12] <%bravebravesrobin> bravebravesrobin subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Sorry I'm late to the stream today, we had to no shows this morning on an already heavily understaffed department, but besides that; hooray for mind goblins!  Also, be sure to let Woolie know that Microsoft is reportedly making a Wu-Tang Klan RPG; GET HYP
[2:08:17] <%lumporr> so what happen when you die, in the canon
[2:08:18] <huskarl_zap> the darkest dungeon was the friends we made along the way
[2:08:20] <+aWanderingKaivo> fuckin audrey
[2:08:21] <SolidusA> It like sex raft experiment LUL
[2:08:30] <slix3431> OMG did you hear what Audrey said?
[2:08:36] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Paige is Audrey?
[2:08:42] <Hydrapissed> as much as hes joking there is a horney duo option lol
[2:08:43] <%TheGreatSkenardo> PeachSaliva Audrey Cosplay when
[2:08:44] <%dekkitout> Audrey sacked the run while everyone was bleeding out their ears
[2:08:44] <%Daxalog> If Renault wanted to be loved theyd have tried harder to live.
[2:08:45] <Baljhet> @lumporr you just...show up again. it hasn't been explained, yet, but time is already pretty broke.
[2:08:49] <Sunstalker> Omg, how did he know Audrey's a bitch?
[2:08:50] <%ScreamLord> Old Audrey was a bitch, I like New Audrey
[2:08:51] <%CheesesSliced> Audrey was the brunch Karen
[2:08:53] <Manwad> Audrey keeps on trying to make "fetch" a thing
[2:08:56] <$chance_h> Dismas x Barristan and Audrey x zombie flu
[2:09:02] <+FadingEmber> okay, unironically the shipping will make each run way more toxic
[2:09:05] <CoupleAGuys> I hope these peasants give us slime again
[2:09:08] <lyzejag> Pee ons deez nuts
[2:09:18] <Vashido22> @PatStaresAt how's the game so far
[2:09:19] <+swesterly> EA like Electronic arts or EA like "Iä fhtagn"
[2:09:21] <%CheesesSliced> Audrey was cockblocking the bros
[2:09:27] <%ScreamLord> Barristan has no strong feelings one way or the other
[2:09:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> @PatStaresAt  I wonder if, when they're more stressed out, they're more inclined to want to tell people to fuck off.
[2:09:35] <@Ranryu692> "I don't want to do this but here you go, peasants" jeez
[2:09:35] <CoupleAGuys> Fuck yeah, more slime
[2:09:37] <%Mendin> flame, dear flame
[2:09:41] <Hydrapissed> and rob them btw
[2:09:43] <%TheGreatSkenardo> I know I am
[2:09:47] <+pectusumbra> The game said as much. Also YO HEAL POTS
[2:09:50] <Hydrapissed> u stressed = evil mode
[2:09:50] <+aWanderingKaivo> morale management
[2:09:55] <scrumbotime> Keep them calm so they'll get along better
[2:10:00] <tanarath> Seems like it, stress gains are from low health.
[2:10:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Unlocking a THERAPIST is the final super class in this game.
[2:10:06] <%lumporr> everyone gets stress relief handdies
[2:10:06] <%CheesesSliced> Yup, stress affects affinities
[2:10:09] <V0LK__> ironically managing stress is stressfull LUL
[2:10:12] <tanarath> So healing is goat.
[2:10:18] <captwolfaroo> You're not you when you're hungry
[2:10:20] <WakeUpThrow> I dig how Dismas is acting more heroic in this one
[2:10:25] <Picia000123> stress mechanic works a little differently this time, I think I like it personally
[2:10:30] <%Ziegsy> good soup?
[2:10:32] <NeoseekerStitch> it's 9:30PM here. :P
[2:10:33] <%CheesesSliced> That's why healing others helps
[2:10:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> PAT
[2:10:41] <royb2> Robert baratheon is back!
[2:10:42] <%TheGreatSkenardo> got ambush
[2:10:44] <+FadingEmber> DD1 was about keeping people positive too. There was just a lot of BS on the way.
[2:10:47] <Demon_chann> Its him
[2:10:48] <moonmintparadise> surpriiiiise
[2:10:48] <CatRidder> ambush
[2:11:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh, you got ambushed
[2:11:06] <+SoySocks> just hopped in, that new art is looking HOT
[2:11:10] <+Ricky_Rexx> DD1 was about keeping yourself positive, no you gotta keep other people positive
[2:11:22] <TrollKing96> So does max Stress guarantee a negative instead of a coin flip?
[2:11:27] <%ScreamLord> Not that blind
[2:11:33] <royb2> these animations are super cooool
[2:11:39] <+aWanderingKaivo> I love the skeleton's animations
[2:11:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Honestly, it's a little thing, but just having the scene of them at the INN fucking DRAPED over their chairs does a really good job of showing just how constantly EXHAUSTED everyone is.
[2:11:44] <Baljhet> yes, max stress is always negative. the Heroics mechanic is now relationship stuff
[2:11:48] <moonmintparadise> @TrollKing96 yeah you basically heart attacked instantly and reset
[2:11:48] <Carlioo> I love how they have to drag their sword back along the ground
[2:12:01] <Demon_chann> kiss
[2:12:02] <%redthebaron> supporting your buds
[2:12:02] <+ALazo> smooch smooch
[2:12:06] <CoupleAGuys> Dismas just patting Barristan on the back, You got this bro
[2:12:13] <+Dustwalker44> it is all brookback mountain up in here
[2:12:28] <Baljhet> friends!
[2:12:29] <+Aniki_Tony> Social Link Go!
[2:12:34] <+pectusumbra> get that little guy out of there
[2:12:37] <captwolfaroo> God, Barristan's animation of dragging his mace back is the best
[2:12:38] <dan_g_v> kiss kiss kiss
[2:12:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> @CoupleAGuys Naw, he's giving him the 'good game' pat. tobide1Sideeye
[2:12:40] <%Mendin> Healer and Tank swapping commends every dungeon, ggwp
[2:12:46] <+Ricky_Rexx> SO is the aim of this game to set up the party 4 way?
[2:12:48] <+ALazo> oh, so now it's not killstealing?
[2:12:49] <%Mendin> And the DPS each other
[2:12:50] <%ScreamLord> Teamwork makes the Dream Work
[2:12:54] <%Mendin> We've got a functional party
[2:12:57] <+swesterly> does this game focus more on building positive traits between the team?
[2:12:58] <+pectusumbra> ahhh but timer
[2:13:03] <homestylewaffles> @Ricky_Rexx that's always the aim
[2:13:08] <olm46> The other classes are still in, right?
[2:13:12] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Not the yips! Not the Yaps!
[2:13:15] <dan_g_v> yiffs?
[2:13:16] <Baljhet> yeah, maintaining relationships makes the game far more manageable
[2:13:18] <+FanServ> absinthe only heals under 25%
[2:13:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Ricky_Rexx Turn this fartbus into a bang bus. LUL
[2:13:23] <+aWanderingKaivo> wow that worked super well
[2:13:24] <+Aniki_Tony> DISMAS!!
[2:13:27] <+Chosington> Absinthe only heals you when you're below 25%
[2:13:28] <AllenDeadman> damn
[2:13:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> DISMAS YOU PIMP
[2:13:29] <%ScrapKingKeita> Advancing Strike grants riposte
[2:13:31] <+pectusumbra> Duelist Advance does that @PatStaresAt
[2:13:32] <ShinyVagikarp> SeemsGood
[2:13:34] <%cooldude69xx> what the hell is Yips?
[2:13:36] <%Mendin> PARRY BBY
[2:13:38] <CoupleAGuys> I think dismas gets riposte from duelist advance
[2:13:39] <%Deft_Thought> Duelist Advance, baby
[2:13:40] <Manwad> DECKED
[2:13:42] <CoupleAGuys> Yeah, there it is
[2:13:43] <%chill_o_wisp> So this is basically just a darker Miitopia, right?
[2:13:44] <captwolfaroo> Dismas has always been the parry king
[2:13:49] <%Mendin> Parry v Royalguard
[2:13:53] <CoupleAGuys> Okay now do point blank shot
[2:13:53] <qo_op> they all like eachother so much they abandon the quest and have an orgy
[2:14:01] <+Ricky_Rexx> @cooldude69xx mental issue makes hands shaky
[2:14:04] <%VioletHeart> Yo a cross counter punch
[2:14:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Imagine if your reaction to getting stabbed was to immediately punch the person in the face.
[2:14:07] <+aWanderingKaivo> I love how his riposte is to just fucking punch you
[2:14:07] <+chiazam> Forgot he was resistant huh
[2:14:08] <+SimplyRandy> Yips is a sports term. It basically is a handwavey / superstitious thing to describe when good players become suddenly mediocre for a time
[2:14:14] <%Ipsenscastle> Dismas has always been my bro
[2:14:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SimplyRandy It's basically performance anxiety.
[2:14:32] <+Ricky_Rexx> Finally, a Darkest Dungeon game with Persona relationship mechanics
[2:14:33] <+SoySocks> woah enemies now have death's door instead of corpse clearing?
[2:14:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SoySocks They have both, it seems.
[2:14:48] <+FanServ> @SoySocks both, but not all
[2:14:49] <CoupleAGuys> Actually, you should let aubrey catch on fire
[2:14:50] <+FadingEmber> Audrey has Paige vibes

[2:15:12] <@Ranryu692> I came in late, did Pat talk about David Lynch's NFT movie?
[2:15:17] <%Mendin> Last run Audrey had Twitter Paige vibes Kappa
[2:15:20] <TheLegendofNate> I mean the yips is basically performance anxiety.

[2:17:37] <HibiscusMist> I love these games so much c:
[2:17:41] <Play_UN_Squadron> theyre missiles if fast enough
[2:17:42] <$chance_h> This is basically a reverse boss fight
[2:17:42] <Demon_chann> true
[2:17:44] <ShinyVagikarp> it really does
[2:17:46] <Lefteron> @Mendin Doctor Doom toots as he pleases!
[2:17:46] <HarmlessCrow> It's a missile when you have guns for arms like Dismas
[2:17:51] <%SinnerEbru> remember how borderlands' art style fucking owned
[2:17:53] <Parapattern> Magic Missile (It's a rock)
[2:17:54] <+Ricky_Rexx> Did he tear off his sleeves to make his face mask?
[2:17:54] <%bevyrage> @Ricky_Rexx missile is a ye olde term for 'projectile' btw
[2:17:56] <joso_grando> goblins are sleeping for now

[2:17:58] <%Nekros4442> Modding in new characters are gonna take way longer to make now
[2:18:03] <+FadingEmber> DD's art style was always great
[2:18:04] <%Agami23> Agami23 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months! hey pat, hope you're having a good day. for some reason seeing the amazing 3d models in darkest dungeon 2 makes me want a darkest dungeon 2 fighting game.
[2:18:05] <+sonofthedeepsouth> There is no consistemcy
[2:18:10] <%X2Eliah> X2Eliah subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Did you know that "Strand" can mean both to a "Beach" *and* "a connection"? And yet "stranding" can be getting beached, or losing all contact with others, as in a loss of connection. #PrincessStrand
[2:18:16] <televisedrevolting> Dismas is fucking cut.
[2:18:18] <%Mendin> Dismas' galactica phantom needs some work
[2:18:22] <General_Terro> this art is fucking rad
[2:18:24] <$apolitenoob> Swap
[2:18:25] <dybia> Dismas is now Cody
[2:18:25] <@Ranryu692> it looks great
[2:18:27] <%Bluwizard21> it looks like the cg in overlord but better shaded
[2:18:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> I love this so much better than the comics from the first game (though the comics were good too).
[2:18:29] <$apolitenoob> Oh phew
[2:18:31] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Tiger Knee
[2:18:31] <%Mendin> You have two turns in a row
[2:18:33] <%Mendin> Ayyy
[2:18:33] <%animaturgy> Is it actually 3D or like.... 2.5d?
[2:18:34] <Saltmeisterr> Its not even cel shaded either
[2:18:38] <sirrice77> @Nekros4442 Don't worry the big tiddie anime waifus will find a way in still
[2:18:40] <%Ipsenscastle> To be fair I got through DD1 keeping all the characters I liked alive the whole time without much trouble
[2:18:40] <scrumbotime> They said YES alarm
[2:18:41] <Saltmeisterr> its handrawn textures
[2:18:42] <%dekkitout> Strands... man!
[2:18:45] <%bevyrage> proper 3D models
[2:18:47] <Baljhet> these are proper models, yeah
[2:18:52] <Hydrapissed> pat get to punching
[2:18:55] <+Ricky_Rexx> Seeing Dismas like this is making me want a Darkest Dungeon Fighter
[2:18:59] <%animaturgy> wow thats rad
[2:19:02] <moonmintparadise> @animaturgy 3D models in a 2.5D screen
[2:19:04] <Hydrapissed> hes YOLKED
[2:19:05] <masheshardest> you don't need rock anymore
[2:19:07] <cochramd1992> yeah punch Pat, it does more damage
[2:19:08] <+Futuretimetraveller> He kinda hot
[2:19:08] <%bevyrage> when you're in jail the only thing to do is work out
[2:19:11] <%X2Eliah> So how is this Dorko Dungo Duo then?
[2:19:11] <AllenDeadman> I can
[2:19:11] <%Deft_Thought> Dismas rules
[2:19:11] <%MelBrooksKA> no tooting allowed
[2:19:13] <+aWanderingKaivo> Dismas the Shredded
[2:19:14] <%redthebaron> dismas got huge
[2:19:15] <CoupleAGuys> Dismas got huge from lifting brickwork all day
[2:19:17] <%SinnerEbru> oh fuck, this style is AWESOME for full rendered 3d models
[2:19:17] <%Mendin> Old-timey jails had a lot of rock breaking
[2:19:20] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Gotta  loicense for These Hands coppah
[2:19:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Seeing how Dismas handles 4 normal humans does 2 GREAT things. It shows you how fucking powerful your team actually is, and how INSANELY powerful the enemies ACTUALLY are and why you're the only people who stand a chance.
[2:19:22] <Sp3ctre48> The way people were mad about the artstyle change, I was expecting something way worse tbh
[2:19:23] <+Ricky_Rexx> Damn Dismas how much you bench dude?
[2:19:27] <+aWanderingKaivo> you must not toot it
[2:19:31] <%baka_sugoi> MOR LORE
[2:19:31] <%Deft_Thought> Does the game still let you change the character colors?
[2:19:34] <%laserbeaming> it's like the Shieldbreaker's dreams
[2:19:37] <kingra> Dismas is badass
[2:19:39] <+FadingEmber> The gameplay here looks less CBT then I thought it would be
[2:19:42] <total_overkill> dude did 10 years hard labour... course hes ripped
[2:19:44] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @Mendin That's how they got their roads paved, and buildings built mostly
[2:19:46] <Lefteron> Wasnt his backstory that he 360d no scoped a woman and child?
[2:19:48] <CoupleAGuys> I wonder if Renault will show up during one of these lore fights
[2:19:49] <moonmintparadise> @Deft_Thought not yet i think
[2:19:58] <+pectusumbra> I think you can just lunge and hit them all now yeah?
[2:20:00] <total_overkill> @Lefteron yes
[2:20:01] <+Ricky_Rexx> I'd imagine summons more dudes
[2:20:05] <%redthebaron> like will one of these lore bits go to the darkest dungeon because dismas went there
[2:20:12] <%dekkitout> @Lefteron Tbf, the kid looked at him funny
[2:20:13] <%SinnerEbru> @FadingEmber less cock+ball torture or less cog behavior therapy?
[2:20:17] <%laserbeaming> @Lefteron I guess that's why he's breaking out of prison
[2:20:31] <+pectusumbra> yeah your lunge can hit 3 so just hit him
[2:20:31] <gespenstkick> Falcon pawnch
[2:20:36] <+Ricky_Rexx> It looked like his fist tore through his chest
[2:20:37] <%CoffeeKaiju> Is Dismas one of Cody's ancestors
[2:20:41] <Mythematical> I wonder if you're supposed to escape from this fight
[2:20:41] <%X2Eliah> oh wow Pat is winning
[2:20:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> YOU WILL NOT DOOT, SIR.
[2:20:47] <%laserbeaming> no tootin'
[2:20:51] <+spaceroyalty> no toot
[2:20:51] <+sonofthedeepsouth> TOOT IT
[2:20:51] <%bevyrage> oh man this is a bad pattern, he's stuck IN A LOOP
[2:20:52] <Mythematical> DO NOT TOOT IT
[2:20:52] <Carlioo> you could stop the tooting with a normal attack=
[2:20:52] <%VictorVonLouche> Just punch him?
[2:20:53] <cheapdoc> @CoffeeKaiju Dismas Traverson
[2:20:53] <Baljhet> NO tooting.
[2:20:53] <Saltmeisterr> yeah these hero stories are based on the comics
[2:20:55] <LVL1_Scumbag> doot

[2:21:04] <@CreepyPorpoise> creepy49Porpkek
[2:21:04] <%Alazull> Lame it out
[2:21:05] <zanzibarian_hamster> Doesn't kneeing him in the face stop the doot?
[2:21:07] <%MelBrooksKA> @sinnerebru less cognitive ball therapy
[2:21:07] <+ALazo> He's been close enough to punch for a minute, though
[2:21:07] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> You can reach him in the front
[2:21:08] <+pectusumbra> I assume if the inhale goes off it summons more guards
[2:21:10] <+FadingEmber> They will definitely call in more if you don't rock him
[2:21:10] <Lefteron> I THREW A ROCK A HIM
[2:21:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Now just don't fuck up and pick the wrong attack
[2:21:15] <%dekkitout> This Dismas costume is pretty rad
[2:21:15] <@GeneralSCPatton> The sentence is stoning

[2:22:01] <%bevyrage> this is a good way to unlock new attacks
[2:22:08] <Lefteron> That and duelist advanse, my bread and butter
[2:22:08] <+eanscrale> Damn I didn't know Dismas was the emperor of Muay Thai

[2:33:22] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Clutch
[2:33:26] <zanzibarian_hamster> duel advance/PBS is the sickest combo in the game
[2:33:28] <LVL1_Scumbag> Nice to see riposte is still obscenely useful
[2:33:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Shwepie I think it's more, the world was 100% fucked, but by beating the 1st game, you now have a .0005% chance of unfucking it.
[2:33:36] <+sonofthedeepsouth> I mean Crutch

[2:33:58] <%Mendin> duelist advance giving you riposte on going in is A+, Dismas got a heck of a glow-up
[2:33:58] <masheshardest> Dismas is a bro
[2:34:01] <Saltmeisterr> BIG NUMBA
[2:34:12] <captwolfaroo> Oh, does Riposte only work once per application now?
[2:34:15] <DanThePumpkinman> so barristan is definitely the bottom to dismas right?
[2:34:17] <%Mendin> Doctor always has an anti-bleed
[2:34:18] <CoupleAGuys> Hellion is rad. I think pat will get her next level up?
[2:34:30] <connieetc> Yea
[2:34:40] <%CheesesSliced> Nice heal!
[2:34:43] <%Nekros4442> so is there a story reason why we dont have the religious characters in the starting roster any more?
[2:34:44] <+Ricky_Rexx> I just can not get over this art style it looks so amazing and such a natural improvement over the first game
[2:34:46] <%Ipsenscastle> @Mendin pretty sure DA always had riposte
[2:34:56] <jmft2000> Is there vitue or is just bad things?

[2:35:07] <nailwind> god this looks amazing
[2:35:17] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Continue
[2:35:18] <tanarath> Maybe heal?
[2:35:18] <%Mendin> Virtue is a positive relationship buildup, at least
[2:35:21] <%skeletonmilk> pat what's your favorite part about 2,2,4-trimethylpentane
[2:35:23] <%CheesesSliced> Friends can help talk down breakdowns
[2:35:24] <+chiazam> UH OH
[2:35:29] <cochramd1992> uh oh, plague girl just complained about kill stealing
[2:35:31] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Audrey is a bitch tho
[2:35:32] <+Rosy_Joan> Pat you have stress heal abilities
[2:35:35] <+ZippZ96> how does this compare to the first? is it good?
[2:35:35] <Demon_chann> doctor is getting stressed
[2:35:36] <SunsetJack> High stress
[2:35:36] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Catfight
[2:35:37] <+Ricky_Rexx> Imagine being so petty you get mad over killstealing in this dire situation
[2:35:38] <AllenDeadman> para being a little stressed
[2:35:40] <%baka_sugoi> csbeastSetIn MORE
[2:35:41] <%TheGreatSkenardo> that's a bug for sure
[2:35:48] <Shwepie> @Nekros4442 Probably died. Canon wise the final boss requires a sacrifice of two characters to defeat.
[2:35:52] <%TheGreatSkenardo> that was the encounter on the other brnach
[2:35:52] <televisedrevolting> That's a bug.
[2:35:52] <Picia000123> If you pick advance, you go to the next round
[2:35:53] <%Tearonex> there's always more LUL
[2:35:56] <%TheGreatSkenardo> somehow you did both
[2:35:57] <+pectusumbra> It's Darkest Dungeon. There is only MORe
[2:36:03] <BackflipCharm> Would you rather have the flesh cart?
[2:36:04] <AllenDeadman> gotta kill that box bastard
[2:36:07] <+chiazam> Paracelsus is getting too stressed
[2:36:09] <Picia000123> it's like that mill thingy in DD1
[2:36:30] <Baljhet> you're not de-stressing her tho
[2:36:31] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:36:35] <+pectusumbra> so if someone's stress starts rising you have to baby them some
[2:36:35] <+xerotwo> MORALE LOW LUL
[2:36:37] <LVL1_Scumbag> How could you betray PD?
[2:36:40] <huskarl_zap> WHENS LEPROSY?
[2:36:40] <SunsetJack> Hahaha
[2:36:40] <the_walkin_dude_19> sommeeeeee bodiessssss jealousssssss
[2:36:41] <CoupleAGuys> When does the guy with the dog show up
[2:36:42] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Bunch of Jealous fucks
[2:36:43] <+Rosy_Joan> Pat you arent stress healing
[2:36:49] <tanarath> Pat, you have stress healing abilities, apparently.
[2:36:53] <+chiazam> Pat you need to prioritize making Paracelsus happy
[2:36:57] <%CheesesSliced> Give defense buffs to Paracelsus
[2:36:57] <+Ricky_Rexx> When are we gonna get a bounty hunter!
[2:37:06] <%dekkitout> Consoom
[2:37:07] <+pectusumbra> Wooo! Fight dat goblin
[2:37:24] <%CheesesSliced> Yup, buff Para A LOT
[2:37:29] <LVL1_Scumbag> He's learned how to use consumables? Can no one stop this madman?
[2:37:35] <%Mendin> Every few levels (gathered at the end of a run via victory or death) unlocks a new character class to recruit into the squad
[2:37:54] <%ScreamLord> You're not healing her stress dude
[2:37:59] <kikoeru_san> this run is going WAY better it seems
[2:38:06] <+FanServ> @PatStaresAt barristan has a good stress heal for the whole squad
[2:38:07] <gespenstkick> Ohhhh consumables are the goblin?
[2:38:13] <%Mendin> This run is fucking Night and Day compared to run 1, I wonder if #1 was intentionally extra-stressful to fuel your spiral loss
[2:38:15] <Saltmeisterr> Btw @PatStaresAt discarding items gives meta progression
[2:38:19] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Heal thou stress
[2:38:26] <gespenstkick> Oh dang
[2:38:29] <gespenstkick> Nice
[2:38:30] <+xerotwo> NOT YET LUL
[2:38:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Heal stress
[2:38:33] <+Ricky_Rexx> DD without the gobbos?
[2:38:36] <%Mendin> Kinda like how the early Inscryption run was Bear Festival and Flying Dogs to try and bop you fast
[2:38:44] <Baljhet> nah, the first run is unaltered, it was just absolute lack of knowledge
[2:38:46] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Cmon Audrey you must bitch
[2:38:46] <%CheesesSliced> What are the stress relief options? Like DD1?
[2:38:48] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> They explode with friendship energy
[2:38:52] <progfix> What does mind goblin mean?
[2:39:03] <%SharkMissile> No 2 people are not on fire
[2:39:09] <+SmartAssPawn089> No dead party the 3rd fight in
[2:39:11] <moonmintparadise> Audrey is really cooperative this time around
[2:39:14] <%dekkitout> Yet she still carries a burning contempt of others
[2:39:15] <%drabberfaun535> Audrey neverburn
[2:39:17] <@GeneralSCPatton> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:39:20] <%SlackerAlex> I really liked the goblin stuff they removed. Rogue-lite feels more fun than grindy xcom regardless of mind goblins
[2:39:26] <%Mendin> Para and Audrey are starting to get a bit cranky
[2:39:27] <SolumFuturae> mind goblin deez nuts
[2:39:30] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> GAH-BO-LIN
[2:39:31] <spectre_shrimp> it is also some kind of ligma disease
[2:39:35] <T_Sasquatch> Brain don't work good
[2:39:41] <%bevyrage> oh that big guy is a kidnapper
[2:39:42] <SilverFaustX> MUST BEAT GAME WITH 50 MEGALIXERS REMAINING
[2:39:45] <LVL1_Scumbag> I wish more games encouraged mindgoblins
[2:39:49] <SilverFaustX> monkaS
[2:39:51] <Chatterbox1991> NGL this run seems way more forgiving than i would have asmed
[2:39:54] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> @spectre_shrimp I thought it was more like hava?
[2:39:54] <the_walkin_dude_19> yeaaaa i havent beaten 1 DD but it's ts superrrrrr grindy
[2:39:54] <%CheesesSliced> How do you relieve stress in battle?
[2:39:56] <kikoeru_san> well here we go, this one feels hardcore
[2:39:56] <+pectusumbra> blinding gas
[2:39:59] <+radok86> radok86 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:40:03] <%mighty_max_t> So when is the Tim Rogers Cyberpunk deal? A Couple hours I'm guessing?
[2:40:07] <$chance_h> This forest is huge, did the early access say if there were more zones available yet?
[2:40:07] <+fresh_foods> damn the animations in this game are so good
[2:40:09] <%skeletonmilk> HOLY SHIT
[2:40:10] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt got a good mind goblin stream, any ff game but you must heal with items only
[2:40:12] <+aWanderingKaivo> those were some big numbers
[2:40:13] <%Mendin> The game showering you with consumables but only being able to use a few per combat is a nice variation
[2:40:20] <%CheesesSliced> Buff Para
[2:40:24] <zanzibarian_hamster> oh those sons of BITCHES are back
[2:40:25] <@GeneralSCPatton> Or "I have to keep quick loading for perfect stealth no kills, because the game says it affects the ending"
[2:40:28] <%Mendin> Do you dont have to be worried about whether or not to use them, just bringing the right tool in advance
[2:40:29] <sirrice77> @mighty_max_t No please i just started watching tokimeki memorial
[2:40:29] <%bevyrage> SHARE THE BUFFS PAT
[2:40:40] <SquiglyBattleOpera> Paracelsus quit being a bitch challenge (IMPOSSIBLE)
[2:40:41] <%Mendin> Especially since items are free-actions to boot

[2:51:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Audrey wants that D, for Dismas
[2:51:12] <nabs96> @deft_thought Doubt it. Game is early access right now. it still needs time to fully develop. A year is the minimum wait time.
[2:51:14] <+sonofthedeepsouth> GET THAT DISMAS DICK
[2:51:19] <%linSP> She wants the D-ismal
[2:51:37] <+pectusumbra> next round blind that music box twit?

[2:51:46] <%Aleate> Para wants the glory
[2:51:52] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> She wants the GLORY
[2:51:56] <muXPerience> paracelsus is a real audrey
[2:51:57] <DigiLapin> Stealing his glory Eh?
[2:51:57] <Picia000123> it's because of stress
[2:51:58] <%Ipsenscastle> Para-medic
[2:52:00] <+chiazam> Paracelsus wants you to use buffs on her
[2:52:00] <%CheesesSliced> Class Dismassed
[2:52:01] <bigb00gi3> you can rename them to something easier to remember, right?
[2:52:07] <%Mendin> Probably just that time of the stress cycle
[2:52:08] <bigshedman> Wow nice kill steal juejuejue
[2:52:09] <joso_grando> she wants deathblow maybe?
[2:52:11] <+DrThroatpunch> I love the animation for Barristan dragging his mace back

[2:52:22] <%CheesesSliced> Buff Para Pat
[2:52:25] <%afronooch> damn :(
[2:52:26] <$chance_h> If a character first hits an enemy, they want to deal the killing blow
[2:52:28] <%dekkitout> No, they just hate fuck eachother
[2:52:28] <zanzibarian_hamster> It is canon that the plague doctor is a smelly misanthrope that no one wants to be around
[2:52:31] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:52:34] <%skeletonmilk> it's not like i wanted that kill b-baka
[2:52:35] <%Ipsenscastle> Every time you talk to Paracelsus you should have to have a ten minute codec conversation about Godzilla
[2:52:38] <+chiazam> 3 STRESS HOLY SHIT
[2:52:42] <Shwepie> @PatStaresAt She doesn't like people killing things she's bled or poisoned. I believe it is superficial rage though.
[2:52:44] <qo_op> pats fucking up their love
[2:52:53] <SquiglyBattleOpera> @PatStaresAt I don't know anything about DD but I noticed that Paracelsus seems to get pissed off when you kill someone after he poisons them. Maybe that's it?>
[2:52:54] <+sixcubit> it is not enough for audrey to succeed. others must fail
[2:52:58] <%CheesesSliced> You HAVE TO BUFF PARACELSUS
[2:53:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Audrey doesn't like kill stealing
[2:53:17] <%dekkitout> Is it so she won't be a bummer?
[2:53:17] <%TheGreatSkenardo> she craves buffs in combat
[2:53:18] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Card games on Horse Carriages?
[2:53:18] <+pectusumbra> I'm guessing put literal buffs on her like with man at arms
[2:53:22] <%CheesesSliced> He’s jelly
[2:53:23] <zanzibarian_hamster> YO WHENS CRUSADER
[2:53:24] <%SharkMissile> Roh noh
[2:53:30] <%ScrapKingKeita> Cultists baby
[2:53:31] <+sonofthedeepsouth> DEVIL
[2:53:31] <Goergorion> run
[2:53:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Maybe fuck off?
[2:53:41] <%bevyrage> just have her finish an enemy off now and then, and toss a buff to jer
[2:53:45] <Vyskus> Is this a prequel
[2:53:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh boy, no round limits
[2:53:48] <%Mendin> Barristan had Fight WitH A Buff, rip
[2:53:48] <%CheesesSliced> Use defense buff on Para when you can
[2:53:53] <BigChiefBear> they look pretty tough >_>
[2:53:58] <sirrice77> @Vyskus sequel
[2:53:58] <CurrySauseBandit> @Vyskus Sequel
[2:53:59] <Picia000123> @Vyskus a sequel
[2:54:00] <Carlioo> para's looking real stressed
[2:54:02] <%TheGreatSkenardo> Para likes it when you use buffs on her in combat
[2:54:02] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt  If your Man-At-Arms buff Para the relationship should improve
[2:54:04] <CoupleAGuys> These cultists are way grosser than the ones in the first game
[2:54:05] <DanThePumpkinman> lmao that was a bad idea
[2:54:11] <+KipTheSmuggler> Pat do you have the inside scoop on when the new tim video is starting
[2:54:20] <Vyskus> oh holy shit, are these 3d models???
[2:54:20] <%VioletHeart> @Vyskus Sequel. I think it takes place literally second after DD1 finishes.
[2:54:28] <$velgaduere> Dismas is having a dismal time
[2:54:37] <kikoeru_san> DO THE BUFF
[2:54:38] <@SSaryn> @kipthesmuggler 6PM Eastern on his Twitch channel. Actual video will be up after its done on Twitch.
[2:54:43] <Shwepie> @Vyskus Yes they are 3D.
[2:54:43] <SquiglyBattleOpera> @Vyskus Yep, it's fuckin crazy
[2:54:44] <Vyskus> @VioletHeart ty
[2:54:48] <CoupleAGuys> These are beefy cultists
[2:54:55] <cochramd1992> because they're women Kappa
[2:54:56] <+KipTheSmuggler> @SSaryn based thank u
[2:55:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> @PatStaresAt It seems that anything above 50% stress causes them to start being snippy babies at each other
[2:55:05] <ebrion> because you are not reducing their stress with bolster
[2:55:16] <Vyskus> @Vyskus this is fucking incredible looking
[2:55:18] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Use Bolster
[2:55:18] <zegram250> all the bullying in my team seems to be directed at the plague doctor for some reason
[2:55:19] <+DrThroatpunch> Higher stress makes a hero more likely to react negatively to others actions
[2:55:35] <@SSaryn> Also I see Pat isn't using Bolstee.
[2:55:38] <@SSaryn> Bolster
[2:55:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> They indeed are not
[2:55:49] <%Deft_Thought> Plague Doc has a stress reducing skill too, I think
[2:55:59] <%ScrapKingKeita> Bolster needs to be upgraded for stress removal
[2:56:00] <nabs96> aw did they remove the resolve portraits?
[2:56:01] <+chiazam> IT CAN
[2:56:07] <Baljhet> you absolutely have to buy a stress heal
[2:56:07] <@SSaryn> Yes it does.
[2:56:17] <Ackolt> Upgraded bolster can, not base bolster.
[2:56:21] <BlindGato> The skills in question need to be upgraded
[2:56:24] <CurrySauseBandit> Need to upgrade it
[2:56:27] <+pectusumbra> looks like it puts on a guard as well
[2:56:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh, needs to be upgraded
[2:56:29] <Saltmeisterr> YOU HAVE UPGRADE IT CHAT
[2:56:30] <%Esparsenior> You have a bunch of mastery points you should of spent Pat
[2:56:31] <+DrThroatpunch> Bolster removes stress when upgraded
[2:56:33] <%ScottishMadJacko> Dumbasses
[2:56:34] <@SSaryn> Oh he hasn't upgraded it. Well.
[2:56:38] <cheapdoc> One guy times 100
[2:56:42] <%Mendin> HE CANT UPGRADE SKILLS YET HE HAS BEEN TO 1 INN WITH 1 LEVEL AT THE START OF THE GAME
[2:56:43] <%ScottishMadJacko> Maybe stop backseating
[2:56:50] <%Arkfyre> chat being mentors right now
[2:56:50] <plaguedoctor_syan> they must be thinking about Bolster in darkest dungeon 1
[2:56:54] <%linSP> pat wins this round
[2:56:55] <%athuramn> the one guy is a mod HypeDerp
[2:56:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Friendship ended with Dismas, Baristan is now my boo, says Audrey
[2:56:58] <%za7az> One guy mod Kappa
[2:57:06] <%Deft_Thought> They do seem quite... Stressful
[2:57:12] <%Mr_Pylon> Mod guy
[2:57:16] <$velgaduere> "my knowledge from DD1 clearly applies to DD2. I am very smart"
[2:57:16] <@SSaryn> Hey, other guy said Bolster and I thought he upgraded, it don't know what to tell ya.

[2:57:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> You know, the last run, these cultists were also what caused the run to start going to shit.
[2:57:47] <Hydrapissed> the cult girls look dope
[2:57:53] <@SSaryn> @scottishmadjacko I see you I'll make you one guy when I riposte ye
[2:57:55] <cheapdoc> It seems that Pat isn't the only one that's blind. Chat can't see what's written on the fucking screen
[2:57:59] <scrumbotime> Milk Eyes
[2:57:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> That stress damage is no joke.
[2:58:02] <kikoeru_san> these fuckers are getting SO stressed
[2:58:05] <%ScottishMadJacko> lol
[2:58:08] <plaguedoctor_syan> What the story for this game? i remember from the taser that there was a mountain
[2:58:10] <+chiazam> Meltdown Imminent
[2:58:15] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt James Sunderland is gonna be in DbD
[2:58:20] <+wizard_of_diamonds> This whole stealing glory mechanic seems like total horseshit tbh
[2:58:22] <@SpaceCapnCrone> Paracelsus unblinded just in time to witness kill stealing smh
[2:58:27] <LVL1_Scumbag> Why you gotta keep stealing their glory?
[2:58:27] <Picia000123> @plaguedoctor_syan end times, basically
[2:58:31] <%linSP> Not gonna lie guys, this game seems pretty stressful
[2:58:34] <cheapdoc> *JoJo music* MELTDOWN MELTDOWN
[2:58:41] <%za7az> @plaguedoctor_syan Evil from first game has gone global, world is ending
[2:58:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> @linSP Welcome to Darkest Dungeon
[2:58:47] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:58:48] <+pectusumbra> gas em
[2:58:51] <joso_grando> paracelsus is getting upset!
[2:58:52] <HibiscusMist> I kinda love how those two flying ones sound like cursed babies
[2:58:56] <plaguedoctor_syan> Oh wow
[2:59:15] <SeeAndShudder> probably because they are cursed babies
[2:59:15] <%redthebaron> cultist are no joke
[2:59:16] <@SSaryn> Para just hitting those Blinds when they should huh
[2:59:16] <CoupleAGuys> Putting the lye on one of your dudes might be a good idea, just to get rid of the corpses quicker.
[2:59:16] <%CoffeeKaiju> what are these anticherubs?
[2:59:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Me thinks that maybe don't fight cultists until you have abilities to negate stress.
[2:59:30] <%extradopeness> hello pat and hello chat
[2:59:35] <%Mendin> Not always optional
[2:59:44] <SquiglyBattleOpera> Paracelsus quit being a bitch challenge (IMPOSSIBLE)
[2:59:46] <Baljhet> it's literally just high stress = bad companions
[2:59:46] <%baka_sugoi> csbeastSetIn
[2:59:47] <gespenstkick> Kill steals
[2:59:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat LITERALLY EVERYONE is stressed out.
[2:59:48] <scrumbotime> It Begins
[2:59:49] <DanThePumpkinman> you're fighting evil flying cult babies. of course it's gonna be stressfull
[2:59:50] <+ALazo> LET THE WORLD FALL TO RUIN
[2:59:50] <$velgaduere> these stress levels are causing them to hate each other
[2:59:53] <@SSaryn> Oh hey is Flashing Daggers not fucking trash anymore..?

[3:00:02] <SunsetJack> Haha
[3:00:03] <Mythematical> @CommanderSqueaks that'd be a really good ideaa if the had the choice to never fight cultists ever, but that's not really an option
[3:00:07] <scrumbotime> Dismas is just fine
[3:00:08] <nabs96> Yoooo relationships???
[3:00:09] <%Mendin> You're getting somewhat close to the next Inn at least

[3:00:23] <%redthebaron> BARRISTAN COME ON
[3:00:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Maybe we avoid fighting cultists, they seem like bad news.

[3:00:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> @CoupleAGuys No
[3:00:33] <+pectusumbra> 7 spd is a lot

[3:00:56] <%Esparsenior> Upgrade? @patstaresat
[3:00:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Hopefully we're close to the inn.
[3:00:59] <CurrySauseBandit> +7 spd may as well just say. You have first turn for 90% of fights.
[3:00:59] <+Count_Graagh> bork
[3:01:00] <%Korzodin> Does the speed remove stress?
[3:01:02] <%ScrapKingKeita> If you're wondering, the whining from characters seems to happen if they are at 4 or more stress
[3:01:03] <@SpaceCapnCrone> yeah, cultists seem to be the turning point for the party going at eachother
[3:01:05] <%strakillias> Man Para was so shitty that she made everybody pissed off
[3:01:06] <$chance_h> Sonic time
[3:01:13] <+FadingEmber> Is the plague doctor a girl? I said Audrey has Paige energy, but that may be more accurate than I thought.
[3:01:14] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Esparsenior Have to be at an Inn to upgrade
[3:01:15] <@SSaryn> Speed can be good on Para honestly for blinds.
[3:01:21] <SVER_Otter> dont the plague doctor have a destress move for the party?
[3:01:24] <+pectusumbra> anything you can equip?
[3:01:25] <%silvery_cricket> goblins
[3:01:26] <%Mendin> Pitch some surplus trunkets?
[3:01:27] <%dekkitout> Dump da moulde
[3:01:28] <%extradopeness> which specific goblin(s) are we battling today
[3:01:29] <Saltmeisterr> slime mode
[3:01:30] <%CheesesSliced> @EbonRed RIGHT?!
[3:01:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SVER_Otter Only on upgrade
[3:01:37] <bigb00gi3> damn, does that say you have 5 mastery? wow
[3:01:38] <gespenstkick> Heh, game caught you hoarding
[3:01:42] <+pectusumbra> clear all corpses looks REAL HELPFUL
[3:01:43] <%Esparsenior> 5 mastery points on hold….
[3:01:44] <Saltmeisterr> slime mode seems worthless
[3:01:45] <%silvery_cricket> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[3:01:52] <%CheesesSliced> Avoid Cultists
[3:01:53] <plaguedoctor_syan> @FadingEmber In the first game i think it was
[3:01:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Esparsenior Can't use until at an Inn
[3:01:58] <SeeAndShudder> per the character intro comic from the first game, Plague Doctor is girl
[3:02:13] <$chance_h> Plague is a girl, her breasts are more pronounced in non default pose
[3:02:24] <SVER_Otter> @SVER_Otter damn upgrades
[3:02:29] <%holydeviant1> Blizzard has announced that the February 2022 BlizzConline event has been cancelled.
[3:02:30] <muXPerience> Plague is a rural boy
[3:02:32] <nabs96> *sigh*
[3:02:33] <PainfulAlternatingCurrent> Maybe the plague doctor is an enby
[3:02:34] <%CheesesSliced> Cultists fuck your fear UP
[3:02:44] <CoupleAGuys> lol blizzcon
[3:02:50] <plaguedoctor_syan> @holydeviant1 Good

[3:03:05] <%dekkitout> Druids?
[3:03:15] <CoupleAGuys> Also, whens modding for this game? We need one that turns plague doctor into plague of gripes
[3:03:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> The floodgates must be released.
[3:03:38] <@SSaryn> @coupleaguys Proper modding probably won't be till full release or close to
[3:03:42] <$chance_h> I really like all those skeleton designs so far
[3:03:47] <%holydeviant1> @CoupleAGuys I want modding for massive, high-definition horny
[3:03:51] <%SaiyanShoto> SaiyanShoto subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! Hey Pat what happens when you text a dead person? They GHOST you
[3:03:54] <+FadingEmber> When's Pat streaming Guardians of the Galaxy? Kappa
[3:03:56] <%CheesesSliced> I’m getting chips. Anybody want anything while I’m up?

[3:04:22] <$chance_h> Can I get a screwdriver @cheesessliced?
[3:04:28] <@SSaryn> @fadingember to be fair apparently it's fine, just definitely not gonna be for everyone considering combat seems fairly simple and straightforward
[3:04:29] <SquiglyBattleOpera> @CheesesSliced Grab me a slice of pizza bro
[3:04:30] <%SinnerEbru> @CheesesSliced if you got queso dip im all in for it

[3:05:40] <%dekkitout> @CheesesSliced Yes sir?
[3:05:50] <%extradopeness> that WAS a quck pee
[3:05:58] <%holydeviant1> Blizzard had to cancel the online part of blizzcon, Pat!
[3:06:01] <$chance_h> I also dig the (semi?) permanent party structure. I kept forgetting party builds and rotations when juggling in the first one
[3:06:11] <%extradopeness> quick, even
[3:06:22] <%skeletonmilk> i swear to god my cats are shitting more than they are eating
[3:06:23] <gespenstkick> Audrey confirmed narcissist

[3:07:54] <%redthebaron> audrey will be the death us again
[3:07:56] <+SoySocks> these snippy fights between characters are GREAT
[3:07:58] <%dekkitout> The adults are talking, Audrey
[3:08:00] <%CheesesSliced> Audrey has a low social stat
[3:08:08] <@SSaryn> Listen. Audrey doesn't like the world ok?
[3:08:10] <Parapattern> Shut the fuck Audrey, I have a PhD
[3:08:12] <%ScrapKingKeita> Fucking Audrey
[3:08:13] <Kasuminoneko> OH SHIT

[3:08:32] <bigshedman> Battlebros!
[3:08:33] <%Mendin> Best Bros
[3:08:35] <olm46> Audrey has a lot of issues and that means you have them too.
[3:08:35] <DigiLapin> Homiesexual
[3:08:36] <Kasuminoneko> too toxic
[3:08:36] <+cyantriton> weren't they just friends?
[3:08:39] <SquiglyBattleOpera> Audrey came from wanting Dismas' Disdick to wanting to stab him in the back what the fuck bitch
[3:08:40] <Parapattern> Lovers to Haters
[3:08:42] <CoupleAGuys> Even through all of this, these two remain bros
[3:08:43] <%holydeviant1> Brothers In Arms!
[3:08:44] <%MugenSandan> BROS BEFORE AUDREYS
[3:08:46] <%strakillias> I swear like 80% of Audrey's stress gain has been from Para being a shithead to her
[3:08:47] <gespenstkick> Dismas left the toxic girl for the bro
[3:08:47] <%dekkitout> This is why you do not fuck the crazies, Dismas
[3:08:55] <%CheesesSliced> Audrey’s cockblocking
[3:09:03] <WakeUpThrow> fucking men of wö
[3:09:13] <@SSaryn> It's not her fault her flashing daggers were trash in DD1 ok
[3:09:14] <lyzejag> Audrey is homophobic fr fr

[3:09:35] <CoupleAGuys> Time ot run
[3:09:36] <NimrodsFailson> christ
[3:09:36] <cheap_turbo> BAIL
[3:09:40] <Picia000123> Pat refuses to heal the grumpy lady
[3:09:46] <slix3431> Pat are there stats causing Audrey to be more likely to be stressed? She may need trinkets to counter that
[3:09:53] <%DSD24> Hey guys is Darkest Dungeon 2 cool so far?
[3:09:56] <%CheesesSliced> I thin Audrey works part-time at my DMV
[3:10:02] <Kasuminoneko> dismas and audrey need couples teraphy
[3:10:04] <cochramd1992> @zanzibarian_hamster hey man, bros before hos is a common phrase for a reason
[3:10:11] <suddenlyscorched> Audrey seems to hate it when someone steals her kills
[3:10:14] <WakeUpThrow> Chat, just got back here. Is this still hte 2nd run? Dismas and Audrey were lovey dovey when I left
[3:10:15] <gespenstkick> @CheesesSliced LUL LUL LUL
[3:10:19] <%CheesesSliced> *think
[3:10:20] <%redthebaron> 6 leagues to the inn
[3:10:22] <Picia000123> @slix3431 the higher your stress, the more likely it is for the char to be grumpy
[3:10:23] <UncleOliver> audrey needs to be kicked for being that guy
[3:10:28] <cochramd1992> audrey needs a lot of therapy to be honest
[3:10:29] <@SSaryn> @dsd24 definitely certain aspects of the game that are not great but overall, they can fix this up real well.
[3:10:41] <$velgaduere> time to destress the fuck out
[3:10:44] <gespenstkick> Audrey already in the back, give her a seat
[3:10:47] <%Ipsenscastle> Hey it's Journey
[3:10:49] <%DSD24> @SSaryn I like the visuals so far
[3:10:50] <+SoySocks> twin peaks, haha get it
[3:10:53] <%redthebaron> the omminous mountain on the background
[3:10:55] <Kasuminoneko> quirks!
[3:10:58] <slix3431> @Picia000123 Is the frequency of those grumpy moments different over chars?
[3:11:02] <Baljhet> ???
[3:11:03] <Saltmeisterr> No
[3:11:09] <@SSaryn> @dsd24 Yeah its easily the biggest part of new game that people are liking.
[3:11:10] <%Mendin> Read that tutorial bit
[3:11:17] <%ScrapKingKeita> Loathing is based off of fighting cultists
[3:11:24] <Picia000123> @slix3431 don't know, I watched Cohh's stream and there it was discussed

[3:13:00] <%Mendin> What does upgraded absinthe do?

[3:17:00] <HarmlessCrow> The Gang Dies of Dysentry
[3:17:12] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt maybe the hospital sells disease res items?
[3:17:18] <%Cykron> Cykron subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Is there a chance you'll stream Metroid Prime 1 or 2 before MP4 comes out?
[3:17:18] <WakeUpThrow> This party will dissolve the instant one of them catches a cold
[3:17:20] <@QueequegTheater> ( ͠° ͟🔴 ͡°) OVERCLOWNFIDENCE IS A SLOW AND HILARIOUS KILLER ( ͠° ͟🔴 ͡°)
[3:17:20] <%Mendin> Are there any stress-reducing consumables?\
[3:17:32] <williamcvolk> So anyway, Dismas started blastin
[3:17:32] <CommanderCOOL> is this game good for fans and first timers @PatStaresAt
[3:17:34] <%CheesesSliced> These bitches gonna die from Strep throat
[3:17:35] <SeeAndShudder> more like Organ Trail, cause they're going to excrete their guts out
[3:17:37] <%MugenSandan> They're playing cards to distract themselves from shitting themselves
[3:17:41] <@SSaryn> New Wayners always a good time.
[3:17:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Mendin Pat literally used like 4
[3:17:42] <%Mendin> WELCOME TO YHARNAM

[3:17:51] <gespenstkick> Oh yeah this is the end of DS3
[3:17:53] <%CoffeeKaiju> old yharnam!!!
[3:17:58] <LuxyDoodle> This game is so happy
[3:17:58] <Chatterbox1991> WHAT'S THAT SMELL
[3:17:59] <$velgaduere> this is Old Yharnam, MID-TORCHING
[3:17:59] <%Mendin> @Mendin No I meant for sale to use mid-trip
[3:18:00] <%hereiam407> Yharnam
[3:18:02] <Chatterbox1991> ITS BLUUUUD
[3:18:04] <$realm_forge> Oh good hunter....
[3:18:06] <HibiscusMist> Aflame means fire debuff?
[3:18:07] <%Mr_Pylon> What does bad digestion do?
[3:18:09] <$chance_h> God damn, we in Detroit
[3:18:14] <$velgaduere> GAMBLING IS THE SOLUTION
[3:18:21] <%kyh9> Playing YuGiOh solves personal issues and mental illness
[3:18:28] <%hereiam407> Always go left
[3:18:34] <$realm_forge> YAY LOOTBOXES
[3:18:37] <%redthebaron> this looks really pretty
[3:18:38] <CatsEyeBlind> This place has fucked me up twice now
[3:18:38] <Kasuminoneko> the power of triple triads
[3:18:53] <AstratesticoMan> @kyh9 I can personally testify that this is a lie
[3:18:58] <$chance_h> Is reminds me of Strathom in WoW
[3:18:59] <%kyh9> What the fuck are you normies doing here?
[3:19:02] <CoupleAGuys> Why are you people still in this burning city
[3:19:07] <+braincraft> I like how the travel minigame is to crash into as many obstacles as possible.
[3:19:10] <%redthebaron> gotta steal
[3:19:16] <bigshedman> @Mr_Pylon Inhibits your ability to gain macro-nutrients, may lead to general discomfort and increased need to visit the toilet.
[3:19:27] <olm46> Such is Audrey's way
[3:19:28] <$velgaduere> @CoupleAGuys also quite apt
[3:19:29] <%hereiam407> Where else is there to go?
[3:19:35] <%CheesesSliced> Give it Audrey
[3:19:37] <$realm_forge> Only child gambling can save Yarnam
[3:19:45] <slix3431> So this is pretty much Warhammer Endtimes?
[3:19:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> I think she gets a black hue, but it's impossible to see with this background?
[3:19:48] <moonmintparadise> it said the opposite of what one wants will negatively affect it
[3:19:50] <%kyh9> @kyh9 Oh shush, threatening to kill yourself to win a match is perfectly mentally healthy
[3:19:51] <@SSaryn> There's definitely many things they need to fix but hey.
[3:19:53] <+sonofthedeepsouth> HOW COULD U
[3:19:53] <AstratesticoMan> some bugs maybe
[3:19:54] <zanzibarian_hamster> Maybe she was just sort of okay with it?
[3:20:02] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  is it basically the apocolypse now?
[3:20:02] <%Mendin> Pat did you ever look at the Loathing tutorial? I might hav emissed it
[3:20:02] <Saltmeisterr> YO
[3:20:03] <Meltgar> DD2 is only EG at the moment right?
[3:20:03] <+pectusumbra> ayyy suspicious cleared
[3:20:04] <Visorak6> Dismas and Audrey got over it
[3:20:04] <+chiazam> Paracelsus is one nervous blighter
[3:20:08] <Saltmeisterr> suspicion is gone
[3:20:09] <+chippracoon> yay there friends now!
[3:20:10] <Picia000123> this is some Berserk shit right here
[3:20:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> I think she's supposed to have a black hue around her, but with this background it's literally impossible to notice it.
[3:20:19] <+pectusumbra> but you don't have supplies
[3:20:21] <reonome> PogChamp
[3:20:23] <%goblincat__> @patstaresat I saw DD2 is on Epic, do you know if they're gonna pull a Hades and put the full release on Steam?
[3:20:33] <Baljhet> backstory is permanent progression
[3:20:35] <%redthebaron> lets learn more lore
[3:20:38] <slix3431> WRONG WAY
[3:20:39] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LORE
[3:20:42] <+sonofthedeepsouth> YAY
[3:20:44] <Picia000123> you have to physically steer into the path Pat
[3:20:44] <Meltgar> Any new characters?
[3:20:47] <@SSaryn> @cactus_gato It is confirmed its only for a year.
[3:20:58] <NephiStreams> they're pulling hades from steam??
[3:21:03] <@QueequegTheater> Everyone point and laugh at chat
[3:21:04] <slix3431> I'm sorry for giving you mind goblins
[3:21:06] <Jaysky> @Meltgar Only one as far as I'm aware atm
[3:21:08] <moonmintparadise> @Meltgar only one but not unlocked yet
[3:21:14] <+FanServ> @Picia000123 the path was straight forward
[3:21:15] <$chance_h> Haha
[3:21:15] <Meltgar> Man at arms looks CHUNKY
[3:21:18] <Ryanlupe> Glad youre playing the game Pat :) I joined someone elses stream that was up for an hour and they were just TALKING THE ENTIRE TIME
[3:21:18] <@QueequegTheater> @NephiStreams No, he means the "real" release is when it drops on Steam
[3:21:19] <%goblincat__> that's a relief lol cuz I really wanna play this
[3:21:25] <Ryanlupe> Love you bro <3
[3:21:25] <%CoffeeKaiju> @NephiStreams noooo no no they were just saying hades started as an epic exclusive
[3:21:26] <Meltgar> @Jaysky @moonmintparadise Thx for info! SeemsGood
[3:21:28] <Jaysky> @QueequegTheater But then I have to point at myself
[3:21:29] <Picia000123> @FanServ ah, my bad then
[3:21:32] <$velgaduere> "conclusion" bro the fight JUST STARTED
[3:21:35] <bigshedman> @NephiStreams No no no, they're pulling 'a Hades', as in doing like HAdes did
[3:21:37] <bigb00gi3> shouldn't it just be used off cooldown most of the time
[3:21:38] <%hereiam407> Absolutely Brillianr
[3:22:01] <CoupleAGuys> Try and push the big guy back, maybe?
[3:22:04] <+Ellila> So. I guess you could say that generally speaking the situation in the world is rather FUCKED in DD2.
[3:22:06] <Meltgar> Thinking about it, Pat, did you ever played MODS for DD1?
[3:22:10] <NephiStreams> ohhh @QueequegTheater @CoffeeKaiju @bigshedman okay i knew i misheard that thank you <3
[3:22:11] <Jaysky> Kill ze child
[3:22:12] <+FanServ> @Ryanlupe tomato always does long intros. he's probably the most similar streamer to pat
[3:22:14] <CoupleAGuys> The urchin seems to want to go to the back row whenever possible
[3:22:17] <%CheesesSliced> TOLD YOU PAT!
[3:22:18] <gespenstkick> Based tank
[3:22:25] <+Local16> look at the stream in time to see tall pat
[3:22:29] <+pectusumbra> blinding gas is the move
[3:22:42] <Meltgar> OH UH
[3:22:43] <$velgaduere> Audrey you lil shit
[3:22:44] <olm46> *wailing*
[3:22:48] <%CheesesSliced> Para loves dem buffs
[3:22:49] <%kyh9> Audrey is always fucking shit up
[3:22:50] <gespenstkick> AT this point I think Audrey is a liability

[3:22:53] <NimrodsFailson> my god audrey just fucking kiss her already
[3:22:54] <Ryanlupe> Damm @FanServ You know what's up lmao; yeah I came form his stream, I really wanted to know the gameplay for this one
[3:23:00] <%DSD24> Oooo the crit
[3:23:01] <%holydeviant1> Goddamn dismas
[3:23:02] <DigiLapin> GOATmas

[3:23:04] <Saltmeisterr> BRUH
[3:23:06] <%redthebaron> dismas mvp
[3:23:08] <Meltgar> Huh, weird that they use gravestones instead of bodies
[3:23:12] <+ALazo> whole party
[3:23:15] <%ScrapKingKeita> Bolster is party wide and has a 50% chance at stress heal
[3:23:18] <isolex_> DISMAS IS GOD
[3:23:18] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> GET HIM DISMAS, KILL
[3:23:21] <%ScrapKingKeita> but it's party wide
[3:23:24] <+Ellila> @Meltgar Early access. Might be placeholder
[3:23:28] <+FanServ> @Ryanlupe tomato and pat are both irritable and insane gingers who do insanely long stream intros
[3:23:36] <Meltgar> Huh, interesting
[3:23:38] <sirrice77> @Meltgar Probably easier to use a gravestone for everyone than unique corpses for every enemy
[3:23:40] <Meltgar> But true
[3:23:44] <%Arkfyre> @Meltgar it mgiht just be placeholder until they make bodies for every monster
[3:23:44] <$mishtershmee> Probably saved them a good amount of effort using generic gravestones instead of individual corpses.

[3:26:09] <dan_g_v> cool
[3:26:09] <%Mendin> Hopefully they're cross-progression
[3:26:10] <%ScrapKingKeita> This is meta progression
[3:26:10] <scrumbotime> I wonder if they're permanent
[3:26:11] <DigiLapin> they do i think
[3:26:13] <Baljhet> they do, yes
[3:26:18] <%VictorVonLouche> They probably do
[3:26:18] <%MonsterEnvy> Wait the Plague Doctor is a lady?
[3:26:19] <%redthebaron> it would make sense
[3:26:19] <Saltmeisterr> they do
[3:26:21] <Meltgar> Yes, plague is a girl
[3:26:22] <televisedrevolting> The Unlocked abilities carry over.
[3:26:22] <zanzibarian_hamster> Wait she was an undergrad?
[3:26:24] <SomeAsianDood> @WakeUpThrow These are based off the 1 page comics from the DD website
[3:26:24] <cochramd1992> YEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
[3:26:26] <%scaryboisupreme> yeah mad scientist girl I lik eher a lot
[3:26:26] <Picia000123> they do

[3:26:29] <%Deft_Thought> I mean they'd have to
[3:26:32] <scrumbotime> makes sense, otherwise you'd have moves you'd NEVER see
[3:26:34] <%DSD24> @MonsterEnvy Yeah she is a lady
[3:26:34] <artificiallynatural> The story stuff is meta progression unlocking the skillset
[3:26:35] <%scaryboisupreme> DO BIG MURDER
[3:26:36] <Estuko> @MonsterEnvy yes
[3:26:36] <+pectusumbra> Awesome!
[3:26:38] <%Deft_Thought> Otherwise you'd never unlock all the character skills

[3:27:14] <%redthebaron> maybe a fight on the second round
[3:27:14] <CoupleAGuys> Hey, still got an upgrade
[3:27:15] <Hydrapissed> gives team DA DAMAGE
[3:27:16] <%Ipsenscastle> i guess early access
[3:27:16] <%Valdorick> TOO GOOD A WAIFU, DON'T EVEN HAVE HER PERFECTED SCENES
[3:27:17] <+pectusumbra> it's a damage buff
[3:27:17] <+Das_Prints> Cool to see the unmasked design.
[3:27:19] <scrumbotime> huff some farts to KILL
[3:27:21] <CoupleAGuys> Vapors is pretty good actually
[3:27:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> She definitely did a murder
[3:27:27] <Jaysky> I always disliked how they hide away all the classes backstory comics. I had to actively dig for some of them
[3:27:29] <%Mendin> Hit em with the old SC Marine Hypospray
[3:27:30] <%kyh9> Huff the Gamer Girl Vapors
[3:27:30] <Saltmeisterr> id take that over incision
[3:27:31] <%ScrapKingKeita> Plague Doctor is a wild support unit
[3:27:34] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Her mentor dies from a condition and she cuts him up. That's in her comic from DD1.
[3:27:37] <Saltmeisterr> make here a full on backline
[3:27:38] <Mythematical> embjöldening vapörs
[3:27:41] <CoupleAGuys> Throw some fart gas in Dismas' face so he can PBD better
[3:27:45] <WakeUpThrow> @SomeAsianDood Oh I know, I meant that, to me, PD's previous backstory didn't show much other than "is smart and crazy"
[3:27:56] <%ScrapKingKeita> I'd take it over blinding Gas myself
[3:27:57] <%DSD24> Paracelsus is gonna find "The Old Blood"
[3:28:01] <+pectusumbra> blinding gas is really strong as well though
[3:28:05] <@SSaryn> Incision is never exactly gonna be a go to but it can still be useful.
[3:28:06] <Jaysky> @AEUG_Ace_Kamille Yep, near live experiments. Perfect for her.
[3:28:09] <royb2> this zone has serious vvulf vibes
[3:28:13] <UncleOliver> ngl i might get this soonish, definitely looks more mind goblin friendly than the first one
[3:28:19] <SomeAsianDood> @WakeUpThrow really. it's implied that she's sick with the same thing that is killing her professor if you look closely
[3:28:20] <Hydrapissed> GHOUL

[3:29:06] <+pectusumbra> ghoul's gotta go
[3:29:09] <CoupleAGuys> That really is just nathan explosion

[3:30:05] <%Alazull> Because he uses knife and pistol
[3:30:06] <Jaysky> @DSD24 Cause he killed a child
[3:30:07] <%Mendin> Probably stressed him out because he got Bit By A Zombie
[3:30:08] <WakeUpThrow> @SomeAsianDood Huh, didn't get that impression at all tbh. Ty, gonna check it out again
[3:30:11] <Parapattern> God that scream ended so many of my runs
[3:30:12] <%Alazull> Dismas is COR
[3:30:22] <+pectusumbra> good choice!
[3:30:22] <CoupleAGuys> Even while stressed, Dismas is a total bro
[3:30:27] <+Emperor_Z> I wasn't here when you started. Do the classes all have default names?
[3:30:27] <%DSD24> @Jaysky Didn't he also kill that kids Mom too?
[3:30:28] <gespenstkick> TANK
[3:30:48] <Jaysky> @DSD24 Sure did. Not on purpose, but still.
[3:30:51] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @DSD24 Yeah, he blew the whole carriage away.
[3:31:10] <+pectusumbra> he's got a dodge buff on him is why
[3:31:14] <$velgaduere> HOW BEEF MAN DODGE SO GOOD
[3:31:15] <%redthebaron> @Emperor_Z yep
[3:31:20] <%Alazull> Men At Arms have mediocre accuracy. Can you buff him?
[3:31:22] <%DSD24> @Jaysky @AEUG_Ace_Kamille I felt pretty bad for him cause he clearly didn't take it well
[3:31:23] <+pectusumbra> only 2 rounds get him
[3:31:25] <NimrodsFailson> @velgaduere hes NIMBLE
[3:31:29] <LuxyDoodle> He's the size of a truck how does he dodge
[3:31:30] <moonmintparadise> When they have aa dodge token, just buff and wait until they trigger the riposte or guard
[3:31:31] <BackflipCharm> Is it just me or is Aubrey kinda bottom tier
[3:31:40] <@SSaryn> MAA has seen a thousand campaigns my dude he can do it
[3:31:44] <$velgaduere> @NimrodsFailson swift AND nimble???
[3:31:46] <%CheesesSliced> Heal before next encounter!
[3:31:46] <slix3431> The freaking meat bog at the beginning was WAY harder than this
[3:31:49] <+Emperor_Z> @Emperor_Z Dismas, canonically living through the entire first game. Good for him
[3:31:57] <%Mendin> Doesnt her pickaxe get a big buff on enemies with a dot on them?
[3:32:03] <CoupleAGuys> Stop throwing skulls at my girlfriend
[3:32:13] <%Mendin> Probably a good time forthe buff vap-welp
[3:32:13] <%kainhighwind1990> Been gone for a bit - did Audrey make up with everyone?
[3:32:17] <%DSD24> Yoooo
[3:32:18] <Hydrapissed> DISMAS MVP
[3:32:18] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Did we see Reynauld at all? Or Crusader not in yet?
[3:32:18] <gespenstkick> WOW
[3:32:19] <Jaysky> @DSD24 Which is why I enjoyed using Highwayman. He's a man of principle despite being a crook, which is always a cool trait.
[3:32:19] <scrumbotime> THAT WORKS
[3:32:20] <%redthebaron> fuck
[3:32:20] <$velgaduere> bwfPog
[3:32:22] <%Alazull> d i s m a s
[3:32:24] <dybia> Jesus
[3:32:24] <WakeUpThrow> I love PBS so much
[3:32:25] <%ScrapKingKeita> NotLikeThis
[3:32:25] <%Mendin> DISMAS YOU'RE THE BEST
[3:32:27] <Carlioo> OWNED
[3:32:28] <slix3431> Lul
[3:32:28] <Hydrapissed> DENIED
[3:32:28] <%redthebaron> oh come on
[3:32:29] <%linSP> boooo
[3:32:29] <Baljhet> scammed
[3:32:29] <%Ipsenscastle> clonk
[3:32:30] <+pectusumbra> damn, took too long
[3:32:30] <%Treuan> close
[3:32:33] <@SSaryn> @kainhighwind1990 lol no
[3:32:33] <+xerotwo> monkaS
[3:32:33] <Jaysky> I can live without the crusader though
[3:32:34] <moonmintparadise> awww that sucks
[3:32:34] <Visorak6> FUCK OFF
[3:32:35] <scrumbotime> well, they at least are friendlier
[3:32:36] <%Mr_Pylon> that suuuuucks
[3:32:36] <%MonsterEnvy> The Ghoul Escaped
[3:32:37] <%kyh9> YOU DIDNT WIN
[3:32:37] <isolex_> DISMAS SO COOL
[3:32:38] <CoupleAGuys> lol owned
[3:32:38] <%Lizard0TM> FUCK
[3:32:39] <Saltmeisterr> boo
[3:32:43] <WakeUpThrow> Aw, that's a shame
[3:32:46] <%DSD24> That was a moral victory for the Ghoul
[3:32:46] <sightlesspyro> really weird choice that you get nothing if theyre on deaths door
[3:32:46] <CoupleAGuys> Ghoulie too strong
[3:32:49] <Saltmeisterr> uh
[3:32:51] <+pectusumbra> also you need need fire
[3:32:51] <ammobasket> Rude
[3:32:52] <sightlesspyro> even if*
[3:32:52] <Saltmeisterr> ur flame pat
[3:32:54] <%SinnerEbru> ooh city layout
[3:32:56] <Saltmeisterr> its a lil
[3:32:57] <Saltmeisterr> small
[3:32:57] <Jaysky> Yo I want Houndmaster back, that fucker and his dog carried me late game
[3:32:59] <%kyh9> dismas
[3:33:01] <cochramd1992> okay now take off the bad traits
[3:33:03] <MittensBroadcast> i aint going to lie, deaths door on the enemies is kind of bull
[3:33:03] <+GrampsGrubberfly> the body requires attention Kreygasm
[3:33:03] <+Emperor_Z> No fair, you're not allowed to use our game mechanics against us!
[3:33:05] <%kyh9> Dismas needs healing I think
[3:33:07] <CoupleAGuys> "You didnt win" says the half dead corpse as it shambles away
[3:33:09] <%Beetlewins> I think the property values on this city would be much higher if it wasn't on fire, personally
[3:33:13] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I realized another downside of it going 3D is increased system requirements, it's not that high but it's less accessible for people with weaker PCs
[3:33:18] <+Chimeraelite> I just got eaten alive by the plague baby
[3:33:20] <Jaysky> Is Bounty Hunter in this (yet)?
[3:33:20] <%Mendin> Yo did you know Wayne June (The narrator/Ancestor) does audiobooks? And he's done SEVERAL HP LOVECRAFT ONES?
[3:33:26] <%DSD24> Is the Leper in this? He was super rad
[3:33:26] <+the_420_dachshund> tis but a flesh wound
[3:33:39] <%CheesesSliced> Cure Audrey's RBF
[3:33:41] <%Alazull> @Beetlewins Perfect time to buy, it's a fire sale
[3:33:41] <Jaysky> @DSD24 He is
[3:33:41] <+GrampsGrubberfly> @SaphronBlackbourne the biggest downside is the hentai mods will be harder to make
[3:33:46] <@SSaryn> @dsd24 he's pretty high up there in the unlockable heroes.
[3:33:46] <sirrice77> @SaphronBlackbourne Yeah i probably can't run this hah, guess i gotta wait for console release
[3:33:48] <WakeUpThrow> @DSD24 He is, but I don't know if he's in the build
[3:33:53] <%Joshbored> @DSD24 he was in the trailer
[3:33:54] <foxenco> Why does DD have better therapy than the real world?
[3:33:58] <%dekkitout> The lights is out!>
[3:34:01] <$velgaduere> catfight in the back seat
[3:34:01] <gespenstkick> Catfight catfight
[3:34:01] <%DSD24> @Jaysky @SSaryn @WakeUpThrow Awesome! thanks guys
[3:34:02] <Picia000123> YEYEYE
[3:34:02] <@QueequegTheater> I WILL TURN THIS CARRIAGE AROUND
[3:34:04] <%MonsterEnvy> No I think Dismas and Paracelees dislike each other still
[3:34:06] <Saltmeisterr> the hoarder might have flame items
[3:34:07] <Picia000123> GUESS WHO'S BACK
[3:34:07] <moonmintparadise> hitting obstacles will put the light out
[3:34:07] <+ALazo> Okay children I'm turning the stagecoach around
[3:34:08] <+froduck42> THAT'S IT BACK TO WINNAPEG!
[3:34:10] <%Ipsenscastle> I miss the town - are there any ways to permanently upgrade your gear?
[3:34:10] <reonome> i will turn this cart around right now!
[3:34:13] <+thetunnelhomer> Oh this guy
[3:34:13] <%redthebaron> it feels like you are doing a really bad family trip with the bickering
[3:34:13] <slix3431> It's the guy!
[3:34:16] <%Lizard0TM> YEYEYEYE CARETAKER

[3:34:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Caretaker is having a rough time
[3:34:27] <%MugenSandan> Is this a Pat?
[3:34:27] <Gutsandlove> THIS GUY
[3:34:29] <+RJay80> rooBobble
[3:34:29] <gespenstkick> He lives
[3:34:29] <@SSaryn> Buy the Caretaker himself
[3:34:29] <%CoffeeKaiju> i love the creepy grinning guy with giant backpack merchant trope
[3:34:29] <notabrobro> IT'S THE DUDE
[3:34:31] <Jaysky> Mom said it's MY TURN to ride shotgun
[3:34:34] <moonmintparadise> oooh its old stagecoach guy
[3:34:39] <sirrice77> @foxenco because they have access to eldritch truths that just make your brain better, or worse but sometimes better
[3:34:41] <WakeUpThrow> Oh god it IS the caretaker!
[3:34:44] <+Emperor_Z> Just baubles? No trinkets or glittering gold?
[3:34:54] <%scaryboisupreme> I really like the direction Darkest Dungeon 2 is going
[3:35:00] <cocobody> There he is! Opulent and imperial!
[3:35:01] <moonmintparadise> yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaa
[3:35:05] <Baljhet> Nope. Just baubles. Paid for in baubles.

[3:37:12] <+reaver93> @linSP It's the medical form of opium
[3:37:12] <Meltgar> How can a zombi dodge.....
[3:37:12] <+Emperor_Z> All this fire makes me think back to The Fanatic and the trauma he caused me
[3:37:13] <%SinnerEbru> YEA PBS THE SUPPORT

[3:37:14] <+Adalore> This animation budget, holyshit

[3:37:44] <$realm_forge> Oh no you’re fighting Arby’s employees
[3:37:56] <Jaysky> God I'm so glad the 3D works so well for this. It looked so jank in the initial reveal trailer but in action it's so fucking smooth
[3:37:56] <slix3431> This team is unstoppable

[3:38:11] <+pectusumbra> don't wait. GIT EM
[3:38:19] <Jaysky> @slix3431 Overconfidence is a blahblah
[3:38:24] <gespenstkick> Dismas used AIGHT BET
[3:38:26] <%Lizard0TM> I miss Vestal and Crusader
[3:38:26] <%Mendin> Did not expect Dismas to become the main character of DD2
[3:38:26] <CoupleAGuys> Only mysterious chemicals can cure fire
[3:38:29] <$velgaduere> oh no, he HATES being on fire
[3:38:36] <%Lizard0TM> I hope they're added in later
[3:39:01] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Are Vestal/Crusader out?
[3:39:02] <Jaysky> I'd like to think all originals will return.
[3:39:04] <%SinnerEbru> yeah friendship points!!
[3:39:05] <%Mendin> NO MORE TSUN, NOW THE DERE
[3:39:06] <%dekkitout> AUDREY REDEMPTION ARC
[3:39:06] <%CappuccinoGuil> LET'S GO LESBIANS, LET'S GO
[3:39:10] <@SSaryn> Listen it's takes a while for Audrey to like people ok
[3:39:12] <%holydeviant1> THEYRE STARTING TO BELIEVE [in each other]
[3:39:13] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Because that'd suck if we lost them.
[3:39:15] <bigshedman> PogChamp When's Leper?!
[3:39:20] <Jaysky> That masochist class was really fun too
[3:39:20] <%linSP> yay friendship!
[3:39:22] <CoupleAGuys> Of course the healer is the only one that gets deaths door
[3:39:35] <bigshedman> Óh shit are you for real?! I loved Leper
[3:39:36] <Baljhet> He's starting to believe.
[3:39:38] <%SinnerEbru> ya did it pat!!!
[3:39:39] <@QueequegTheater> If I remember DD1 right Leper is fucking overpowered
[3:39:42] <%kainhighwind1990> @PatStaresAt Is houndmaster or whatever still in?
[3:39:43] <Gutsandlove> FRIENDSHIP WINS
[3:39:43] <%kyh9> Avengers.jpg
[3:39:43] <%Lizard0TM> I also want to see Bounty Hunter and Hound Master return
[3:39:43] <televisedrevolting> Don't jinx it.
[3:39:43] <%drabberfaun535> now to fight cultists
[3:39:48] <%CappuccinoGuil> POWER OF LESBIANS, YES
[3:39:48] <%CheesesSliced> Buffs are clearly SUPER IMPORTANT
[3:39:49] <%Mendin> Just took a bit of group immolation
[3:39:50] <DigiLapin> FRIENDSHIP jermaChomp
[3:39:50] <gespenstkick> De-stress dismas though
[3:39:50] <+pectusumbra> yeah you start with these 4 and more unlock with runs. Pat will probably get at least 1 new character after this run
[3:39:50] <%okuriskyles> the darkest dungeon is the friends we made along the way
[3:39:51] <BackflipCharm> Feels good too turn relationships around
[3:39:53] <Goergorion> 👏
[3:39:54] <televisedrevolting> Leper is the fucking strong.
[3:39:54] <%ScrapKingKeita> Leper is like... REALLY dumb from what I saw
[3:39:55] <CoupleAGuys> This is going way better than the last run
[3:39:58] <%vivaldiva> Hellion waifu when
[3:40:04] <%dekkitout> Holy hell is this Yharnam
[3:40:04] <Jaysky> @QueequegTheater They hit like a truck but their accuracy is ass
[3:40:06] <+pectusumbra> need the flame
[3:40:08] <%DSD24> Leper had those crits
[3:40:09] <Parapattern> I liked shield maiden a ton
[3:40:13] <Baljhet> Leper is "a gigachad."
[3:40:16] <%linSP> assley
[3:40:18] <%redthebaron> we really need the light
[3:40:19] <%CheesesSliced> Dude, buff before next encounters
[3:40:28] <Saltmeisterr> Hellion, Leper, Occultist, and Runaway are the one's left
[3:40:41] <%DSD24> Occulist was really cool
[3:40:41] <+pectusumbra> gotta use more items for sure
[3:40:45] <%CappuccinoGuil> Vestal is best, because her backstory is that she was super bi and super horny
[3:40:46] <CoupleAGuys> Can you feed plague some slime right now, or only at the inn?
[3:40:46] <%dekkitout> No Jester?
[3:40:55] <%scaryboisupreme> Kill Jester
[3:41:05] <+SoySocks> jingle is our friend
[3:41:09] <%Rehse> Rehse subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[3:41:10] <+Emperor_Z> I wonder if Antiquarian will be in this. So you'd be choosing to use for not just for a single mission, but for the entire game
[3:41:11] <%CheesesSliced> If you buff and heal before the next encounters in battle you’ll boost social
[3:41:11] <slix3431> Arbalest?
[3:41:11] <moonmintparadise> @dekkitout he is in
[3:41:16] <Jaysky> Jester is in yes
[3:41:17] <+GrampsGrubberfly> the devs decided jester was too powerful and deleted him :) Kappa
[3:41:19] <gespenstkick> @scaryboisupreme Jester is our friend!
[3:41:21] <%Mendin> Other Character Classes Unlock As Cross-Run Progression
[3:41:22] <%DSD24> I liked the cool Snake Spear lady I think she was the Dancer?
[3:41:26] <zanzibarian_hamster> Jester was the fucking sickest before his nerf
[3:41:38] <%scaryboisupreme> I don't care, I paid for the game. Kill Jester
[3:41:42] <%Mendin> Shieldbreaker
[3:41:49] <@SSaryn> @dsd24 Shieldbreaker.
[3:41:49] <Meltgar> How bad did they nerf Jester?
[3:41:56] <Meltgar> I remember he being a blood lord
[3:41:58] <gespenstkick> @scaryboisupreme Okay, Jester is dead... Game ovah
[3:42:02] <Meltgar> Bleeding for days
[3:42:07] <Jaysky> Shieldbreaker is dance lady and yeah she was super strong but offset by her dreams
[3:42:07] <%DSD24> @SSaryn @Mendin Thanks for the correction!
[3:42:07] <zerointelligence000> how do you get party members to get along? Is it just luck?
[3:42:09] <+pectusumbra> Dismas: And then I pulled out my Gun!
[3:42:10] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Put Finale through the floor.
[3:42:17] <isolex_> DISMAS SO COOL
[3:42:20] <%SinnerEbru> dumo some shit on the road
[3:42:23] <+DesmondtheOrc> man this game looks absolutely stellar, aesthetically
[3:42:25] <artificiallynatural> @Meltgar prenerf jester could start the fight with finale and instantly kill someone
[3:42:26] <%DSD24> The Overencumbered man
[3:42:31] <isolex_> He's the gigachad
[3:42:33] <%Mendin> Gonna assu,me you can sell trinkets, so pitch some smoke bombs?
[3:42:40] <%linSP> is the game easier or harder now, enemies seem to have more health
[3:42:41] <%dekkitout> @AEUG_Ace_Kamille That was the whole point of Jester- tf
[3:42:49] <Jaysky> So chat, would you prefer they introduce all new classes or ensure all classes return?
[3:42:52] <$velgaduere> HE RETURNS
[3:42:54] <%SharkMissile> Oh dear
[3:42:55] <cochramd1992> BIG BOYS
[3:42:57] <Meltgar> BIG BOIS
[3:42:57] <$velgaduere> REVENGE OF GHOUL
[3:42:58] <%DSD24> Some big bois
[3:42:58] <Visorak6> oh no
[3:43:00] <Estuko> oh big monkaS
[3:43:03] <%CheesesSliced> This had improved on DD1 massively
[3:43:04] <%Deft_Thought> UH OH
[3:43:04] <@SSaryn> @linsp Harder right now overall but at this point, that's probably due to balance at this point.

[3:43:17] <DigiLapin> two big huge burly men block your path
[3:43:19] <CoupleAGuys> We're here with Huge Crew
[3:43:21] <+DrThroatpunch> Those are some larg mans
[3:43:35] <+pectusumbra> absolutely use items here these guys SUCK

[3:43:41] <+DrThroatpunch> Stop interrupting their Huge Quest
[3:43:41] <+GrampsGrubberfly> Men: size large
[3:43:44] <%Mendin> "Our bodies are strong but our friendship is stronger"
[3:43:45] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @Jaysky I'd accept new characters if old ones had their stories canonically ended.
[3:44:03] <Giothegame> These animations are so gooood
[3:44:04] <Jaysky> @scaryboisupreme If the difficulty is what holds you from completing it just mod it or adjust difficulty to your liking.
[3:44:06] <gespenstkick> Yaaaay the bitches are frens now
[3:44:09] <%CappuccinoGuil> How did Pat turn it around with the character relationships?
[3:44:10] <Saltmeisterr> imbolding dismas when he's ready  to PBS seems like the play
[3:44:15] <+DesmondtheOrc> yo why does ghouls actually look kinda cool though?
[3:44:24] <CoupleAGuys> lol

[3:45:32] <Baljhet> "lose" is relative, you're still in a good position.

[3:45:59] <Meltgar> WOW
[3:45:59] <Jaysky> @bigdumbstreams My issue with the animation is when there's the same enemy types lined up and you can see their animations synced up at battle start

[3:53:01] <%Nekros4442> @sporeian94 its Tim Rodgers
[3:53:12] <%Beetlewins> @sporeian94 It's that Tim Rogers is a blowhard who cannot write succintly, so the review will be like 15 hours long
[3:53:15] <sightlesspyro> deaths door on enemies is already rough not making a crit finish them seems a weird choice
[3:53:16] <sirrice77> @sporeian94 The guy who is gonna do the review goes super in depth on stuff, like literal hours of talking about everything possibly related to it
[3:53:16] <Picia000123> this run is done done
[3:53:17] <foxenco> @sporeian94 You just gotta watch one of his reviews to understand how different they are
[3:53:24] <heartlesshealer> Tim Rogers is worth it

[3:53:56] <gespenstkick> That shaman needs to super go
