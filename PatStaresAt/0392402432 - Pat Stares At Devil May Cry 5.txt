[0:04:31] <$DesertPenguin09> 4pm is too early for people with normal jobs. 6 or 7 would be perfect to get home, make dinner and then chill with my favorite streamrr
[0:04:40] <%MarylandJutsu> pffttt the shaaaade
[0:04:43] <%JoltyJ> Using Pat's "Don't get hit" advice rather than trying to stylebeast off the bat was actually really helpful.
[0:04:47] <person181> i need more pizzza time
[0:04:54] <Soulbishop> Nice just found out you can discord overlay in game and watch stream while you stream! Streamception!
[0:04:57] <dsauce999> This assumes that we want competency in the LPs
[0:04:58] <Skatedeandre> Chat it’s vvmyn’s day

[0:05:21] <$cureneckbeard> I still don't understand why Paige can't spell "women" correctly. Is it because of the lupus?

I pushed on it’s horns which is apparently how you challenge a goat to a fight so it started to ram me. I had to use the broomstick to hold it back. It was terrifying and I was pinned in front of a locked door waiting for one of my friends to unlock it. Once I finally got in the house I could hear the goat pounding it’s head on the door.

[0:35:58] <Kaitepaints> @angriestpat I was trying to get this goat to stop eating my shirt, I just happened to have a broom in my hand so I tried to nudge it away with the broom stick. I pushed on it’s horns which is apparently how you challenge a goat to a fight so it started to ram me. I had to use the broomstick to hold it back. It was terrifying and I was pinned in front of a locked door waiting for one of my friends to unlock it. Once I finally got in the house I could hear the goat pounding it’s head on the door.

[0:41:30] <%brickwall35> Pat, I assume people will get into the game files and unlock the special taunts that way, will you look those up or earn them yourself without getting spoiled?
[0:41:30] <dekkitout> Griffon is the Hype
[0:41:34] <Dingo_Eejit> !?!?? - also "fuck yeah" pretty much confirmed
[0:41:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Time To Get ripped and Suck Ghost Dick whose wit me

[0:41:41] <+Salvation122> He is, which is hilarious considering someone was bitching about DmC's swearing being crass in the subreddit earlier today
[0:41:45] <powerprotoman> "the angel that presided voer my birth said I HAVE TO KEEP GOING"
[0:41:47] <Paradocks23> Oh my god he reads poetry as a taunt?

[0:42:18] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Am I crazy, or is Griffon also Johnny Yong Bosch?

[0:43:45] <Artista_AF> LUL
[0:43:46] <yourliteraldog> Sounds like a chello
[0:43:47] <%NopeBadguy> The V stands for Violin
[0:43:56] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat I also like the one where he's orchestrating Rise of the Valkyries
[0:43:57] <stratfel112> He looks like a malnourished Kylo Ren
[0:43:57] <Paradocks23> Okay, V is best boy now.
[0:43:57] <%GeneralSCPatton> @bestwaifuritsu Well, someone better use Cheat Engine then. I need to see that stupid dance, and it better have only 2 frames of animation.

[0:44:20] <Pookiedaexzile> No These characters all are TRendy Bitches with mad swagger, and Only one of them has girlfirned. Dante walked around shirtless in a Trench coat with a gun bra
[0:44:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Yes, V is Kira
[0:44:32] <Parapattern> I can't see that movement animation without thinking that it looks like V is riding on a segway

[0:49:53] <yourliteraldog> 1.) Litter for no reason
[0:49:54] <Artista_AF> why would you EVER avoid the chance of KoolaidNightmare
[0:49:55] <+DeniedPants> So how did you find these secrets?
[0:49:56] <%LokimenD> !uptime
[0:49:57] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 49m 58s.
[0:50:01] <%JayEarly> I like that V's cane transforms into a ghost sword
[0:50:01] <%JenovasPuppet> FUCK YEEEEAH!
[0:50:02] <zedravan> Can't wait for the kool aid mods

[0:50:10] <Gutsandlove> LUL cool aid man
[0:50:13] <+miguelrod777> pat you now have anthem ads running lol
[0:50:14] <+Salvation122> I do wish Nightmare had voice lines
[0:50:15] <%ScreamingMeat> Black Goo Kool-Aid is the best
[0:50:19] <jestrfestr> this game has too little dan tay
[0:50:22] <Pookiedaexzile> So between him, Mr,.X and Kool Aid man, who breaking down more Walls
[0:50:23] <DavidCCK> macho man? is this where you went?
[0:50:23] <dekkitout> This game is packed with Kool-Aid Man-isms, between Nico and Nightmare
[0:50:23] <ShichiNoBushi> Dante might be too cool to say curse words like "FUCK YEAH!!", but that doesn't mean Griffon isn't.
[0:50:24] <T_Sasquatch> @AngriestPat have you been encountering situations where you turn on auto assist accidentally while playing /
[0:50:28] <+tigerfang86> WARRIORSSSS

[0:50:33] <stirlingw17> V: you dear challenge me and my stand, Cool Aid Man!!!!!
[0:50:34] <dukenux> V probably mixes his Kool-aid with fine wine.
[0:50:39] <Gutsandlove> we need the mods to put cool aid man as nightmare
[0:50:40] <bestwaifuritsu> da na na na na

[0:50:58] <hassanico> Like I don't understand why I like this
[0:50:59] <Soulbishop> Curious how this style system works with V and keeping track of 3 pets
[0:51:06] <%JayEarly> @derovell well nightmare was a shapeless mass of goo so it can look like anything it wants to
[0:51:06] <%Niney_Who> But you have to Purp-kill them
[0:51:07] <etalmeta> @derovell the rest is just goo

[0:51:19] <Silverbee> @AngriestPat Nightmare seems to work/look just like a golem from dragons dogma, which would make sence since this is capcom

[0:51:44] <heckingjen> hes such a dork
[0:51:44] <+SparkAfterDark> Griffon got his ass kicked by Dante and so instead of doubling down on being an edgy demon lord he tried to emulate Dante's goofy personality because he acknowledges that he was beat fair and square, meaning Cuh-razey is more powerful than Honor.

[1:06:37] <%JenovasPuppet> SRorbs
[1:06:38] <sileo_patronus> As if stabbing dante is a bad thing
[1:06:39] <blackdragonz> because this is a DMC game and Dante has to be impaled
[1:06:40] <Shishi1205> He's mundus for sure (theory)

[1:22:30] <%dreamfillah> you guys can't stop talking about royalguard, so yes
[1:22:32] <kingbaconcrispy> Woolie guard
[1:22:32] <%JoltyJ> little over an hour @Mrthepastyrider
[1:22:32] <+Austinck> its a woolie thing
[1:22:33] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Don’t assume
[1:22:35] <HeavyC4> gunslinger is acutal viable
[1:22:40] <Dakuu75> @bleugh they are fired seperate now in gunslinger mode only though
[1:22:45] <bleugh> ohhhhh
[1:22:46] <Ahk_90> Is this the best Dante has ever been? YES
[1:22:46] <$nademonkey1100> this is literally the first dmc game i have ever watched and never played them
[1:22:47] <LordOfThePoultry> @angriestpat does dange still have dreadnaught?
[1:22:47] <HeavyC4> in DMC3 they were viable htanks to the gun upgrades but in DMC4 LUL
[1:22:49] <+tigerfang86> royal GUARD

[1:23:39] <+tigerfang86> he can't shave normally
[1:23:43] <+tigerfang86> that's not STYLIN enough
[1:23:45] <%JenovasPuppet> So what happens if you beat Uriel on this mission?
[1:23:45] <dero45> Rolling around at the speed of sound
[1:23:49] <Artista_AF> demons are cheaper than razors
[1:23:50] <MatheusSipolatti> This new live action sonic certainly is better than the last design
[1:23:58] <floatRand> He has slots in his schedule for three things: sleep, pizza and killin'
[1:23:59] <lethallylactic> Yor too slooow
[1:24:01] <floatRand> No time for shaving.

[1:24:48] <$SGrim> @Nikit0sBarb0s old criminal I believe
[1:24:50] <%JoltyJ> oh wow, it does look like a dab from the back
[1:24:50] <%Noponiz> also i am pretty sure you get waaay less royal guard meter
[1:24:51] <@SSaryn> Also gives you really minimal RG gauge.
[1:24:53] <+Landsharks> what if you have no DT
[1:24:53] <+Plankman> oh LOVE how dante gestures in tge d-pad direction of the style
[1:24:55] <%valachi> @AngriestPat What happens when you lost all DT?
[1:25:05] <fmc009> Royal Guard changes PogChamp
[1:25:05] <HeavyC4> @Landsharks if no DT? maybe health
[1:25:08] <+Exyoh> This sounds like the new vocal
[1:25:13] <+Plankman> he snaps his fingers on his right hand for Swordmaster
[1:25:15] <pshuuu> i just finished the game any never used RG cause i didnt try to see if i lost health. damn. pretty good now
[1:25:15] <%px120> So security for DT. Interesting
[1:25:23] <+Exyoh> Since the game's actually out now, it's been patched
[1:25:28] <Finaldragoon> why would they let you buy moves for Rebellion if it gets destroyed in the prologue?
[1:25:46] <@SSaryn> I fucking love Sinscissors so much.
[1:25:48] <MarvelManning> I've never played a Devil May Cry, but I've always thought it looked like something I'd really like, and getting into Best Friends (rip) made me even more interested
[1:25:53] <%Noponiz> watch out, the third one is a fuck
[1:25:54] <SaltiestAlex> Look at these dmc 1 enemies
[1:25:55] <tri3dgE027> I am sad Royal Guard's Dreadnought Mode did not make a return....
[1:25:59] <pshuuu> the clashing mechanic is so good in this
[1:26:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Damn, they really telegraph that insta kill window
[1:26:03] <Dakuu75> @Finaldragoon probably get's replaced wtih another-other sword later maybe?
[1:26:07] <waifoong98> LUL
[1:26:14] <powerprotoman> pat playing his best
[1:26:14] <+mugwugsampoo> LUL
[1:26:16] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Pat you’re fucking up
[1:26:17] <MyDarkStorm> You cant change out subhuman?
[1:26:23] <Neathergrasp> How long has the stream been up?
[1:26:25] <%JoltyJ> Tahts; a lotta damage!
[1:26:26] <MarvelManning> whenever I do end up getting into the series, I at least wanna play 4 before 5, I don't think I would have the patience to play through all of them lol
[1:26:26] <@SSaryn> You can Stinger their Stinger and it counts as an open up to one shot
[1:26:30] <Thalchampz> you can change subhuman later
[1:26:36] <waifoong98> stinger spamming SCHUMM LUL
[1:26:38] <MarvelManning> but I would def go back to 3 at some point
[1:26:41] <fmc009> DT Stinger Kreygasm
[1:26:47] <darcfowler1995> And fuck subhuman it’s such trash
[1:26:58] <etalmeta> @MyDarkStorm pat is leaving default on for the 1st stream
[1:26:58] <@SSaryn> Nah new Subhuman is actually pretty alright.
[1:27:03] <tri3dgE027> Oh yeah...how do you kill these guys in 1 shot again? The DMC1 Timing was kinda changed
[1:27:11] <+Austinck> can't you change it
[1:27:12] <waifoong98> therefore it sucks LUL
[1:27:15] <SaltiestAlex> Little V did it best
[1:27:21] <%Radoh> Good job being wrong, Ssaryn.
[1:27:25] <%sirmackslot> Did you start with Balrog?
[1:27:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Subhuman instrumental was always ok. It was the dumb vocals that ruined it
[1:27:28] <$NocturneNovember> Subhuman doesn't have that "chases teenage girls" vibe to it anymore
[1:27:34] <@SSaryn> But it's not good and it's not bad, it's fine.
[1:27:37] <%ScreamingMeat> It's no Devil Never Cry
[1:27:41] <dickbuttwoman> Can you MGSV it and put in whatever song you want?
[1:27:43] <@SSaryn> Which to be fair, makes it bad.
[1:27:43] <powerprotoman> pats gremlins
[1:27:47] <ovan20> LUL
[1:27:57] <+Plankman> cute bug
[1:28:02] <kingbaconcrispy> I agree, everyone liked subhuman until they released the vocals.
[1:28:02] <HeavyC4> the trick to royal guard is replace it by dodging
[1:28:03] <simpo98> Yooo sup @AngriestPat and chat doodBro doodBro doodBro doodBro
[1:28:04] <fmc009> where's woolie when we need him?
[1:28:07] <HeavyC4> don't stand there and do nothing
[1:28:10] <TyrantBelial> @AngriestPat I wish I could give certain enemies certain songs, like the Proto Angelos always cause Ultraviolet to startt playing.
[1:28:17] <blackdragonz> pat has just join THE ROYAL GUARD
[1:28:19] <missyninjaeris1313> i can feel woolz disappointment all the way from ga
[1:28:20] <%JayEarly> @tri3dgE027 I think they have to be in the state where their face is freaking out before headshots kill them
[1:28:24] <Fien111> I love that I get an Anthem ad when I load in to the stream
[1:28:25] <%JoltyJ> @dickbuttwoman no, there's song packs you can buy with songs from previous games.
[1:28:35] <+Sigmatub> Just switch it with “when devils cry” problem solved @angriestpat
[1:28:40] <waifoong98> are those flying blade from 4 back in this? because playing baseball bat with RG feels great
[1:28:40] <VHLW> is this a new save?
[1:28:45] <Neathergrasp> Is this the second Dante level?
[1:28:53] <kingbaconcrispy> Then everyone got mad because of the controversy. I get it, the guy is a pedo but let's judge the song for what it is. Okay with meh lyrics and poor sound mixing.
[1:28:57] <%Tarcanist_> when is the live action cutscene playthrough? @angriestpat
[1:29:04] <dickbuttwoman> @JoltyJ Oh, I know that. What I mean is, is there an exposed file somewhere that you can just drop songs into and the game will read them?
[1:29:04] <%konekoryugamine> NO
[1:29:05] <Paradocks23> Because it's so incredibly broken?
[1:29:06] <+Plankman> oh the glass shattering/bullet hole on the style select is VERY Good
[1:29:10] <%valachi> @kingbaconcrispy Nah the song is shit
[1:29:11] <%JayEarly> The DMC 1 and DMC 2 songs are rerecorded and they sound really good
[1:29:13] <beefomkers> Boil gard
[1:29:13] <%JoltyJ> not that I know of
[1:29:16] <+tigerfang86> if only pat knew someone who knows how to royal guard well.....
[1:29:18] <+DeRedBaron> i just realized his air taunt or just som eo fhis taunts are just lucifer stuff
[1:29:19] <+tigerfang86> usedThinking
[1:29:25] <iforgottousername> So, uh how do I customize combat tracks? I pre-orderd the game, but I don't see where the option is
[1:29:26] <waifoong98> @kingbaconcrispy it is shit even without the controversy
[1:29:52] <+Sigmatub> Its just a bad sounding song in general
[1:29:55] <Ahk_90> jeeez, the game is generous with the green orbs this time around
[1:29:55] <viridianowl> LUL
[1:29:55] <simpo98> have to say tho V is surprisingly more fun to play as than i thought Pat
[1:29:55] <kingbaconcrispy> Like I said, everyone liked it, until the lyrics dropped.
[1:29:55] <%JoltyJ> @DeRedBaron Lucifer's the best weapon I never figured out.
[1:29:56] <dickbuttwoman> I don't like Subhuman at all, even the replacement one. It just... isn't Dante
[1:29:57] <+Exyoh> They removed his vocals anyway. It's foolish to put *that* down to 'judge the art, not the artist.'
[1:30:01] <%Edgy_Macaroon> LUL
[1:30:02] <%ThePuddingDead> i hate them and the empusa queens
[1:30:05] <dickbuttwoman> Even if it was a good song. it just isn't Dante's style at all.
[1:30:07] <+DeRedBaron> i think mos tpeople haven't figured it out tbh
[1:30:19] <%valachi> @kingbaconcrispy "everyone liked it when it was just a three second sample"
[1:30:21] <floatRand> V just fucks with me on some weird level. It is not as immediate, I suppose.
[1:30:26] <Shishi1205> Best weapon for dante? @AngriestPat

[1:35:08] <+skyheys> I really appreciate that DMC doesn't magnetize you towards airborne enemies. KH2 and especially 3 just make Sora fly up to enemies above him, stripping you of your ability to make mistakes in regard to the Z axis.
[1:35:16] <fmc009> what other DT improved moves does he get, other than Stinger?
[1:35:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @AngriestPat Can you activate DT to get out of command grabs?

[1:36:06] <Gamesalsa > @AngriestPat should i play the other dmcs before this one?
[1:36:14] <dukenux> I expected Subhuman would eventually grow on me. The lyrics don't sound AS terrible as before, and the guitar was always fine, especially for a soundtrack.
[1:36:17] <tri3dgE027> @captainahab_37 sure you can, but that is kinda playing MGS4 without playing thr previous MGS games. This is basically the MGS4 or DMC with the amount of fanservice the game provides

[1:38:53] <Gamesalsa > @Them00n thanks! ive always liked dmc but have never gotten into it
[1:39:00] <%ScreamingMeat> They actually explain out of the games that the reason Dante's DT change appearance with his weapons was because it was still developing and being influenced by the demonic power inside them. So in DMC1 when he's more developed the influence is weaker and by DMC4 Dante's power is fully matured and is strong enough to not be influenced by demonic weapons anymore

[1:51:11] <fattyboy067> wait what was mission 10?
[1:51:12] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Mr. Dante I don’t feel so good
[1:51:18] <Hyphixsys> @dukenux this serves as a prequel-esque, you won't see Trish being a demon you fight
[1:51:22] <KZN02> Sparda stands for "SuPer-Admin Restricted Desktop Access"
[1:51:30] <%madhattergay> that big dude definitely has vergil's VA
[1:51:48] <dukenux> @Hyphixsys Wouldn't he do to Trish what he did to Lady before?
[1:51:50] <nyghtmare42> Aw man. RIP Rebellion for real. :(
[1:51:51] <+DevinMayCry> Give me some fireworks
[1:51:54] <%ScreamingMeat> I just noticed that all of Urizen's powers are variations of Dante's old weapons. The light arrows from Artemis, Quicksilver's time stop, Pandora's lasers, Gilgemesh's vines
[1:51:54] <%ElenaManetta> Did he duck under that
[1:52:01] <%ElenaManetta> Was that a unique animation if you approach it
[1:52:03] <Dingo_Eejit> @ignisacer - yeah me too, maybe I got banned as well?
[1:52:05] <Soulbishop> V: "I don't feel so good Mr. Dante"
[1:52:08] <+stelfury> he did
[1:52:08] <%yoshkosh20> is that his main sword now that rebellion is dead?
[1:52:11] <Hyphixsys> @dukenux who knows what Capcom will do, honestly LUL
[1:52:12] <%ElenaManetta> Neat-o
[1:52:12] <%px120> And with DT too
[1:52:13] <Soulbishop> Can we meme that ^
[1:52:14] <dukenux> yep
[1:52:16] <shevan123> @AngriestPat it was completely different back in DMC 1, right?
[1:52:17] <KZN02> RIP Rebellion
[1:52:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Rebellion, the last remnant of DMC 2
[1:52:23] <mdkcde> Is this place LITERALLy the start of Dark Souls 3?
[1:52:23] <HeavyC4> @ScreamingMeat light arrows are artemis
[1:52:28] <HeavyC4> alongside the giant laser beams
[1:52:34] <%yoshkosh20> the time table is now clean
[1:52:35] <+chaumiester> Is this the subhuman song? It sounds different...?
[1:52:35] <Mrthepastyrider> Nightmare called he wants his sword back
[1:52:44] <+critfumble_> rebellions great i prefer it to the soul caliber
[1:52:49] <%GeneralSCPatton> What happens if you bought Rebellion upgrades?
[1:52:49] <%ElenaManetta> Is this considered a triple A game? Because it certainly has the production value of one
[1:52:50] <dazed_wanderer> I thought you couldn't DT with sparda in 1.
[1:52:52] <%px120> @shevan123 It didn't have DT in 1. So no one really used it.
[1:53:00] <TaurusOxford> @Mrthepastyrider Soul Edge would lose its shit if Dante held it.
[1:53:01] <dukenux> I AM OMEGAAA
[1:53:02] <%JoltyJ> Nightmare called, he said "OH YEA" and broke through a wall.,
[1:53:09] <kingbaconcrispy> No it's a SSS game
[1:53:10] <nicestboi> is it a launcher?
[1:53:10] <SsHomes> subhuman sounds weird as hell
[1:53:15] <+Exyoh> Dante's gotten big huge since DMC1
[1:53:16] <KZN02> You want souls, but I want coke!
[1:53:18] <%ElenaManetta> @kingbaconcrispy apatDab
[1:53:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Wait, did we not even see Dante fight Balrog? I missed the end of last stream
[1:53:27] <%ScreamingMeat> @HeavyC4 I just said the light arrows were from Artemis. I don't remember it having a big fuck off laser in DMC3 though
[1:53:33] <etalmeta> @Sphincter_Spelunker it's in the prequel novel
[1:53:35] <%QaizerArt> !uptime
[1:53:35] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 53m.
[1:53:38] <Hyphixsys> @Exyoh he's even bigger in DMC2, but no one plays that LUL
[1:53:39] <%Niney_Who> Ah now this is the Dante Devil Mission
[1:53:40] <%JoltyJ> @GeneralSCPatton looks like they carry over
[1:53:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> FUCK THAT'S LAME
[1:53:42] <%Niney_Who> *Demo not devil
[1:53:43] <waifoong98> boooo
[1:53:44] <Nina96> Dante in Dark souls 3?
[1:53:46] <LordOfThePoultry> yup LUL
[1:53:47] <hauntingstarfish> subhuman sounds like that song pantera did for that spongebob episode
[1:53:52] <KZN02> He fought the boxer guy?
[1:53:54] <kingbaconcrispy> @ElenaManetta Yeah!
[1:53:58] <kingdomkey92> there's a prequel novel?
[1:53:59] <%madhattergay> 6 minutes until i can play my own copy
[1:53:59] <%ScreamingMeat> Boo, it should have been in the game
[1:54:00] <bleugh> is it just balrog from street fighter
[1:54:00] <+Hertzeil> I think it's kinda lame they said that Dante can find hidden weapons and then it ends up being only one.
[1:54:01] <Megapikman132> That would require lucia to be in the game LUL
[1:54:03] <Soulbishop> I though Sparda pulled all your DT into it like the Thors hammer just being a focus. Or like Inuyasha sword keeping his power from running wild. I got like 3 other nerd references that basically make the same point.
[1:54:07] <kingbaconcrispy> @hauntingstarfish Death Rattle
[1:54:10] <TaurusOxford> @Sphincter_Spelunker Balrog was too much of a jobber. Wasn't worthy of being in the game. LUL
[1:54:11] <powerprotoman> also in the prequel novel lucia
[1:54:12] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Balrog allows Dante to use him as a Devil Arm to him having mad respect for Dante
[1:54:19] <Artista_AF> considering Balrog speaks i would be surprized if he joined willingly
[1:54:20] <SaltiestAlex> But when does dante fight Ryu
[1:54:21] <+Exyoh> DMC2 is canonically before 4 now, so expect the biggest & hugest in this game
[1:54:22] <LordOfThePoultry> CRAZY TALK
[1:54:24] <Hyphixsys> a lot of these games are mostly prequels LUL
[1:54:26] <HeavyC4> @Soulbishop Sparda sword has REAL power. it not a focus like thor hammer where the power is from thor
[1:54:27] <+critfumble_> i love that the parry pose carries over pretty muc hall the capcom properties its so cool
[1:54:28] <kingbaconcrispy> The voice is similar but they sing much faster in that song
[1:54:28] <Artista_AF> *wouldn't
[1:54:36] <dukenux> Is this Spencer Mansion ?
[1:54:42] <AllAccordingToPlan> no castle superbeast playthrough for this game?
[1:54:44] <SnaKemuho> Balrog also broke the old Cerberus that Dante had from 3
[1:54:44] <Nina96> did pat get the hat yet?
[1:54:53] <dukenux> @AllAccordingToPlan LP on Woolie's channel
[1:54:54] <hassanico> No
[1:54:54] <Soulbishop> @HeavyC4 Ty for clarifying
[1:54:56] <TaurusOxford> @AllAccordingToPlan on woolie's channel
[1:54:56] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Dante also tells Balrog to stfu just like he did to Agni and Rudra
[1:54:57] <Neathergrasp> Death scissors vs mephisto

[1:56:03] <%LtSergei> dante's battle theme just doesn't seem to fit him at all

[2:02:11] <AMajorTom> you --- did it
[2:02:11] <+critfumble_> is that from bayo or DmC
[2:02:11] <LordOfThePoultry> pretty sure dmc 3 did that
[2:02:12] <$Corporate_Redeemer> HSWP HSWP HSWP HSWP HSWP
[2:02:18] <PowerWeightedCell> dmc3 did that
[2:02:21] <+d00msdaydan> does that make high fov a handicap
[2:02:24] <+DeRedBaron> i actaully notice that, and i try to use that to my advandage with V
[2:02:24] <%Jackeral> get the secret gun Pat
[2:02:24] <HeavyC4> in DMC3, that was a thing
[2:02:25] <$HentaiSenpai9K> That started in DMC
[2:02:27] <anuchallengertwitch> Not gonna lie, I love Subhuman as a battle theme. Having the Chorus scream "YOU CANNOT KILL ME! I AM OMEGA!" when you have an S rank is pretty badass
[2:02:28] <+peri_d0t> @critfumble_ bayo 2
[2:02:28] <waifoong98> the big scarecrowin 4 works like that
[2:02:29] <bleugh> i don't like that because it let's you cheese...
[2:02:36] <Nikit0sBarb0s> If I don't see it, mb it will go away
[2:02:38] <Soulbishop> Either Pat got a identical couch with a shorter back or he's actually sitting up straight.
[2:02:39] <PowerWeightedCell> enigmas on DMD without screen cheese monkaS
[2:02:40] <DaBigVitus> Bill Burr once said "any job you can do in your pyjamas is not a hard job" @AngriestPat thoughts?
[2:02:42] <kingdomkey92> DmC reboot did it
[2:02:43] <SsHomes> crazy combos are pretty much gone @asuxley
[2:02:44] <+peri_d0t> that shit isn't in bayo 1 let me tell you
[2:02:44] <VorpalSlash> It was the only way to make LDK mode bearable in DMC4
[2:02:45] <+DeRedBaron> i know bayo 2 relaxed it but made it really really obvious for long distance moves
[2:02:54] <+DeRedBaron> DmC turns their ai off basically
[2:02:58] <Nina96> 3 did? oh good
[2:03:01] <+mugwugsampoo> YOU CANNOT KILL ME, I AM Pepega
[2:03:10] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> Its a genuinely great design choice cause no one likes getting hit by shit they couldn't possibly avoid

[2:23:26] <blackdragonz> well someone has to always impale themselfs
[2:23:27] <%RageKingDomo> ohhh so hes Vergils Nobody
[2:23:29] <anuchallengertwitch> So basically, Urizen is Vergil's Heartless and V is his Nobody
[2:23:29] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Nakey Emo Boi D:
[2:23:29] <$NocturneNovember> But how does V have tattoos though?

[2:23:43] <+MrN64> Please tell me I'm not the only one reminded of that Danny Phantom special by this cutscene
[2:23:44] <+FoolsArcade> V is Vergils heartless? Or his Nobody?
[2:23:44] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> THAT is why he goes by V.
[2:23:44] <powerprotoman> suprising "EVERYONE"
[2:23:44] <gigacanuck> and he was Urizen too
[2:23:44] <+The_Lumpy_Walrus> LUL
[2:23:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> so V is technically Trish?
[2:23:45] <indig0bird> Kingdom Hearts is canon!
[2:23:45] <cerberuscarmine> thats cool
[2:23:46] <%dreamfillah> I leave my humanity behind ,JOJO
[2:23:46] <$Corporate_Redeemer> KINGDOM HEARTS MAY CRY
[2:23:47] <+VektorTroika> Kingdom Hearts but the story makes sense
[2:23:47] <+JgarnO> Vergil without POWER
[2:23:47] <Artista_AF> what a tweest
[2:23:47] <+miguelrod777> A NOBODY
[2:23:48] <+peri_d0t> V IS VERGILS NOBODY
[2:23:48] <fakemalegamer> i can't believe DMC is Kingdom Hearts
[2:23:49] <Shishi1205> So that's why he says he was born 2 lives ago
[2:23:49] <deswescappy> o..oh
[2:23:49] <callsigneagle01> But now Vergil is 100% Nelo though?
[2:23:49] <+critfumble_> thats some kingdom hearts bullshit
[2:23:49] <$drbuttss> V ergil
[2:23:50] <Prevot> vergil woke up to injustice
[2:23:51] <%Zamorouskiwhich> "Gee Woolie, why does your mom let you have TWO Virgils?"
[2:23:51] <%Remery_> no shut up tho
[2:23:52] <closetgremlin12> so does that make V a nobody?
[2:23:52] <waifoong98> Here comes the most brutal line
[2:23:52] <$nademonkey1100> is that why he is so fucking edgy
[2:23:52] <shadytreeofknowledge> tom AND JERRY
[2:23:52] <%JoltyJ> He's Vergil's Heartless, Urizen would be the Nobody.\
[2:23:53] <Plague_bagel> LMAO he is his nobody LUL
[2:23:54] <%yoshkosh20> don't bring that KH garbage into this!
[2:23:54] <Shishi1205> days*
[2:23:55] <+Shaggnar> His internal human self is edgy
[2:23:56] <+코코꾸라> So a nobody
[2:23:56] <+GeneralHysterics> This is KH as fuck
[2:23:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Holy shit, this really is Kingdom Hearts
[2:23:57] <%RageKingDomo> Kingdom Hearts V
[2:23:58] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat is the demon vergil now negative edge?
[2:23:59] <+Bad1uck> Always knew Virgil was an edgelord
[2:23:59] <+Ell1ot> wait, so Virgil's humanity is Kylo Ren?
[2:23:59] <Dalkalopagus> Urizen should have just been called Ergil
[2:24:00] <%skizzuto> How has no one rebuild or demolished their old house yet? it's been decades
[2:24:00] <devanmuse> V is Vergirl. And Urizen is Vergil. Everybody's theories were confirmed!
[2:24:00] <NeetKiller> Youre a NOBODY
[2:24:00] <$ooblagis> If Vergil didn't have cool demon powers, he would have emo tattoos
[2:24:03] <%Niney_Who> YEAH VERGIL YOU IDIOT
[2:24:03] <$Corporate_Redeemer> V/ERGIL
[2:24:03] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat so Vergil is a huge closeted Hot Topic fan

[2:24:08] <+FoolsArcade> @JoltyJ makes sense
[2:24:08] <KZN02> So Nero has two dads?
[2:24:09] <joneworldbeater> So this is how Vergil gets character development. Nice
[2:24:09] <+kabuhiro> ture devil??? but he's still omly half
[2:24:09] <Aydarkzero> i can't believe V was a Nobody all this time

[2:26:48] <%yoshkosh20> pizza demon is obligated to make pizza puns
[2:26:49] <OceanGaming94> DIS FOKKEN GAEM
[2:26:54] <indig0bird> A better question would be: how lame would his human part be?
[2:26:56] <+chaumiester> So... how did Human.... Vergil... becoming fully human... become... Goth?
[2:26:59] <fakemalegamer> 🍕 🍕 🍕
[2:26:59] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> His human side and demon side would just be best buds
[2:27:03] <%maskedriderhero> They call me Dante the Pizza Eater, has a nice ring to it, huh?
[2:27:04] <Dingo_Eejit> painfully lame
[2:27:05] <callsigneagle01> Wait Im lost. If V is just Vergil's human side how does he have powers?
[2:27:06] <GreenBrains_> moon2SP
[2:27:10] <KZN02> Maybe Vergil was secretlygoth?
[2:27:12] <$valriot> He'd basically be Shin Sparda
[2:27:16] <dekkitout> Dante, Seeker of Pizza
[2:27:17] <OceanGaming94> GOTY 2019
[2:27:18] <lethallylactic> PogChamp
[2:27:19] <$Corporate_Redeemer> @chaumiester Because Vergil cut himself
[2:27:20] <Aydarkzero> it be like Nega Scott where him and his normal self go out for Pizza
[2:27:24] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat give me one single distinction between Dante and a Ninja Turtle
[2:27:26] <+AlcoholicTarzan> WHAT
[2:27:29] <%JayEarly> Cavaliare fucking rules
[2:27:30] <KZN02> That makes Vergil sound emo
[2:27:32] <lokoangel48> lol
[2:27:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @chaumiester It's the embodiment of his mood in DMC 3 LUL
[2:27:41] <$nademonkey1100> why do they say the moves as they doo them.....
[2:27:42] <gigacanuck> this weapon is just so fuckign cool
[2:27:43] <MrHappyFunshine> His demon side would probably just be sparda 2.0
[2:27:44] <SsHomes> emo is not goth
[2:27:45] <mayorrev> can you ride the bike freely throughout the level?
[2:27:45] <beefomkers> This entire time you were playing as shitty Vergil who could have guessed
[2:27:49] <abakkus> @chaumiester become human, get feelings, get depressed, become goth
[2:27:49] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Tokyo drift these demons to death
[2:27:56] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> Where do you find Kalina Ann Pat?
[2:27:56] <+VektorTroika> If Dante likes pizza, Donte likes pizza with pineapple
[2:27:57] <TioXyco> @nademonkey1100 anime logic
[2:27:57] <Dragon_Batman> V probably tried to hold on to some of the power given to him by Munus is my guess
[2:27:58] <eastmonroe> I love this soundtrack'
[2:28:00] <+chaumiester> That's a good point... How does V have any DT power if he is the pure human split of Vergil,....????
[2:28:05] <$SGrim> How is this not the best weapon? That was incredible!
[2:28:07] <anuchallengertwitch> Vergil is really immature when you think about it, and I kind of like that for his character.
[2:28:08] <Aydarkzero> @nademonkey1100 makes them stronger duh
[2:28:11] <%superc37> basically V is vergils nobody and Urizen is his heartless.
[2:28:11] <Dragon_Batman> Mundus*
[2:28:22] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> V's DT is literally other demons
[2:28:25] <KZN02> I wonder if Nico's van can transform into a weapon
[2:28:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Not himself
[2:28:32] <%dreamfillah> GOD
[2:28:34] <Thalchampz> REAL IMPACT
[2:28:34] <%superc37> Also the nightmare shit DOES get explained.
[2:28:36] <dekkitout> DO lT AGAIN
[2:28:38] <purpuraj> Are Vs powers not just the result of demonic pacts?
[2:28:38] <Aydarkzero> i love that Kingdom Hearts concept is being used in dmc games now haha
[2:28:40] <callsigneagle01> @chaumiester does the human form just have it's own powers to it? Has it always been like that?
[2:28:41] <%px120> Finally we got it
[2:28:43] <abakkus> is he full human or is he just like. vergil's conscience in a body? since he has DT
[2:28:44] <+Shadowthedigger> Fitting that he should have Ken's moves.
[2:28:51] <saltyvest> I haven't got real impact yet, is it busted like in 4?
[2:28:59] <%TenderBabyBacon> @superc37 I think its the other way around. Heartless are the souls and Nobodies are the Body
[2:29:00] <Artista_AF> ok im kinda dissapointed that you can't just ride the bike forever LUL
[2:29:00] <+VektorTroika> @Shadowthedigger and Zero's
[2:29:01] <striderzer0> are there taunts that change with what weapon you have?
[2:29:02] <indig0bird> Probably has still a little bit of Virgil's powers
[2:29:03] <%px120> Did he just die
[2:29:04] <KZN02> Dante spirit attached to Ken in Super Smash Bros
[2:29:04] <+chaumiester> @callsigneagle01 I don't know.... I'm actually more confused....
[2:29:04] <%dreamfillah> it's a demonic motorcycle
[2:29:05] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Cav also gives super armor on attacks
[2:29:06] <+Ninja_Kareca> @angriestpat can you do Distortion Impact with Balrog?
[2:29:06] <+Salvation122> OH NO
[2:29:06] <beefomkers> I live for real impact
[2:29:11] <Negus_Rex> how'd he get kalina ann?
[2:29:15] <hassanico> @saltyvest Pat said it's so strong he can't tell the difference between normal and distorted version
[2:29:18] <%dave323dave> jesus christ motorcycle combos
[2:29:18] <lokoangel48> Dante for smash
[2:29:20] <anuchallengertwitch> Well yes, it's a chainsaw motorcycle
[2:29:22] <TioXyco> @Negus_Rex found on the ground
[2:29:22] <gigacanuck> oh that cheeky lizard
[2:29:23] <dekkitout> He found it- no seriously
[2:29:24] <floatRand> Aerial motorcycle combos
[2:29:25] <Aydarkzero> if Dante split to his devil form his Human half would just be Ken LUL
[2:29:32] <KZN02> That would make a lot of sense
[2:29:39] <%sirmackslot> best weird weapon?
[2:29:39] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Chainsaw Motorcycle is such a cool concept for a weapon
[2:29:42] <LordOfThePoultry> he literally just mcguyvered a devil arm together together LUL
[2:29:43] <pectusumbra> Does KAnn get anything in gunslinger?
[2:29:51] <petiskoide> dante's human part would be leon s. kennedy
[2:29:52] <KZN02> So would the demon half become Violent Ken?
[2:29:56] <hassanico> @pectusumbra HOming lockon volley
[2:29:58] <floatRand> Missile salvo, downward firing and whanot
[2:29:59] <+critfumble_> nah i dont think so dante is lame but hes not as lame as ken

[2:30:13] <+chaumiester> No, Dante's Pure Human Version would be.... Leon S. Kennedy from RE

[2:30:18] <KZN02> Transform and rollout!
[2:30:21] <+timblenaut> it's just a ride-able chainsaw

[2:30:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Valentinius_Anodyne Nearly a reason why DMC 2 was so behind when Itsuno jumped on. The concept was back from then
[2:30:33] <Fujiwara_92> OH

[2:32:47] <dan_g_v> Pat also needs a Nihogg for his Pee Qiplhot
[2:32:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pat doesn't piss. His body directly 3d-prints kidney stones.
[2:32:51] <Pnutz409> DId he bob ross yet?
[2:32:53] <$Corporate_Redeemer> V IS Vergils human half
[2:32:58] <Idon__> Pat needs to replace his bag with a new one.
[2:33:02] <dukenux> So let me get this straight... V is just Vergil, if instead anime he'd discover goth metal.
[2:33:05] <callsigneagle01> What about before that?
[2:33:06] <dan_g_v> V is for Vendetta
[2:33:08] <%FrostMass22> Happy International VVomen's Day
[2:33:12] <beefomkers> @callsigneagle01 V is Vergil, Urine is also Vergil
[2:33:16] <dekkitout> Also there a lot of Kingdom Hearts jokes involved
[2:33:18] <danknugglit> V is kiriye
[2:33:20] <+miguelrod777> v is vergil nobody
[2:33:23] <dukenux> Urinzen
[2:33:25] <%0dokuro> This confirms Vergil's human half is straight up Emo
[2:33:27] <MatheusSipolatti> V is Patty
[2:33:28] <Idon__> What is this Kingdom Hearts shit I see before my very eyes
[2:33:32] <callsigneagle01> That's about it tho?
[2:33:33] <dukenux> KiVVami means Vergil
[2:33:36] <otaku9392> them z targets
[2:33:40] <Pnutz409> His name is V, the irgil is silent
[2:33:40] <%weissguard> OH Jesus. Nero hanging around with V is just a Father-Son outing. LUL
[2:33:40] <+Ninja_Kareca> V is Vergil before his Downfall Kappa
[2:33:41] <+miguelrod777> also trish is back
[2:33:41] <KZN02> SoundwaVe
[2:33:51] <KZN02> V for Victory
[2:33:54] <Idon__> V is Vergil's Heartless and Urizen is Vergil's Nobody, got it.
[2:33:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> That's why the DMC subreddit stole all the KH memes!
[2:33:56] <beefomkers> Vergil is Goofy
[2:34:01] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Urizen is Ergil and V is V. So put them together and you get Vergil
[2:34:03] <danknugglit> V means EXTREME
[2:34:06] <beefomkers> Dante is Donald
[2:34:08] <dukenux> also shout out to "not your mommy" and wacky woohoo pizza bike
[2:34:08] <dan_g_v> V is Vergil if he had awoken to the justice of Goth Anime
[2:34:19] <MatheusSipolatti> @Corporate_Redeemer Ergilv? What a dumb name
[2:34:21] <KZN02> Vergil has a Gothic Lolita fetish?
[2:34:22] <%nanov11> v is made from the literal edge of you know a sword
[2:34:25] <+miguelrod777> nero is sora
[2:34:28] <dekkitout> Next thing you know, Rapunzel is in Beyo 3- actually.... that'd be kinda slick
[2:34:28] <Nina96> @dan_g_v LUL
[2:34:29] <callsigneagle01> No, V is Vergil if Vergil got into Edgar Allen Poe shit instead of Japanese shit
[2:34:37] <+SpaciousWheat> PAT MAY CRYYYYY
[2:34:38] <VRNK> god you're right
[2:34:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> @dan_g_v and Stando Powa!
[2:34:39] <KZN02> Nevermore
[2:34:43] <$Corporate_Redeemer> @matheussipolatti Why do you refuse to humor the joke?
[2:34:45] <dan_g_v> Vergirl probably loves the shit of Lolita fashion. He probably has a folder full of fishnet stockings and choker
[2:34:46] <%MelBrooksKA> V means reading the mind of the opponent
[2:34:51] <callsigneagle01> YOu guys didn't notice that before?
[2:34:52] <beefomkers> V is Vergil but into steam punk goth shit
[2:34:54] <Nina96> Pat May Pee
[2:34:55] <strawberrysyenite> v is vergil but an incel
[2:35:04] <callsigneagle01> Yeah V is EAP to the absolute maximum
[2:35:05] <%0dokuro> You can take the devil out of Vergil, but can't take the Vergil out of the devil.
[2:35:05] <%JoltyJ> @dekkitout Rapunzel would be a super strong Umbral Witch
[2:35:08] <$Corporate_Redeemer> V IS Vergil if he worked at Spencers
[2:35:10] <$SGrim> Real Hot Take: Urizen should be called Ergil. rookek
[2:35:11] <KZN02> The Virgin Vergil and Chad Dante?
[2:35:12] <+SpaciousWheat> V is Virgil if Virgil was cool Kappa
[2:35:12] <TetsujinTiger7> I feel that V could be a prosecutor in Phoenix Wright
[2:35:14] <callsigneagle01> Right down t the book and cane and tap-dance
[2:35:15] <dekkitout> Ikr!
[2:35:16] <pepeDforever> V is Vergil but drawn by a deviantart fangirl

[2:35:43] <$Corporate_Redeemer> V is a gay goth cowboy
[2:35:43] <dukenux> I just realized Vs cane is another nod to DmC WutFace
[2:35:46] <%MelBrooksKA> @0dokuro The Vergil doesn

[2:43:18] <$839ricky> Might be a spoiler: What would Dante’s human half named D be like? Virgel is a prep, but without his confident devil side makes him an insecure sickly goth, then would surfer Dante without his devil confidence side be an overweight man-child? cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 cheer100
[2:43:19] <Dragon_Batman> A good call
[2:43:21] <+CookieCutter007> YEYEYEYEYE

[2:43:35] <%TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat Damn I was away for like 5 mins and missed how you got Kalina Ann.
[2:43:35] <dragoon001914> Making DMC5 after how fans reacted badly to DmC was the smart move.
[2:43:35] <Futurecity10> Seriously how come no one fucking talks about how golith is a literal reskin of Damien
[2:43:36] <wummzy> i still havent beat dd 1
[2:43:38] <wummzy> XD
[2:43:43] <Aonthatguy> But wouldnt true coop due better for a game like dragons dogma
[2:43:44] <dukenux> jesus Cavalier is so Kreygasm
[2:43:44] <dekkitout> You mean true zapping Kappa
[2:43:44] <joniroquai> So its like Rockstar how they prototype and refine mechanics between games?

[2:43:51] <pistofficer> am i watching Torgue?
[2:43:53] <dragoon001914> What would be even smarter would be to release Dragon's Dogma Online to the West.
[2:43:53] <fabo_joyful> !help
[2:43:57] <Bust_ER> nightmare is a reskin of the golem in dd
[2:44:03] <+Ninja_Kareca> @futurecity10 we all mentioned that mang LUL

[2:44:03] <gigacanuck> get styled on nerds

[2:44:05] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Idon__)
[2:44:09] <%flagi64> @angriestpat what's the difference between this and caviler- r?
[2:44:09] <dan_g_v> now if we could only get a remake of Breath of Fire in the near future
[2:44:10] <+Melbogathra> The donuts are maximum "Foolishness Dante"
[2:44:12] <+SpaciousWheat> I won't lie btw I'm dissaponted that the dlc songs are those remixes from the DMC recap
[2:44:13] <Hydrapissed> ooo0o0 man it clashed
[2:44:13] <%Niney_Who> HE PARRIED PogChamp
[2:44:14] <Hydrapissed> wow
[2:44:16] <Shishi1205> How does dt look like with cavalier?
[2:44:17] <pshuuu> was that a bike clash
[2:44:19] <+Austinck> @AngriestPat after mega man 11, RE 2 and now DMC 5 what do you think is next for capcom?
[2:44:20] <@SSaryn> I AM SUBHUMAAAAAAAAAN evoCharge evoCharge evoCharge evoCharge evoCharge
[2:44:21] <alrobot2014> bike parry
[2:44:23] <%DK_Rance> @dragoon001914 duuuude if we got the mmo in the west Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:44:23] <+beany482> Now dante has a stand?/?
[2:44:27] <bashful_bard> This game is dope
[2:44:35] <dan_g_v> hell, I would be happy with a new Darkstalkers... even a Pocket fighters!
[2:44:37] <AzureSkyKnight> Colors
[2:44:38] <HeavyC4> Caliveere R has no super armor and is FASTER
[2:44:39] <strawberrysyenite> cavalier r is red so its cooler
[2:44:48] <@SSaryn> If I remember correctly, I'm pretty sure just faster and no armor.
[2:44:49] <alcors_wisdom> stands were introduced in part 3 @beany482
[2:44:53] <+zaworldo> Can someone fill me in from last time
[2:44:58] <%Afterman_> why give up super arnor
[2:44:58] <TakesGuts> when you DT with cavaliere he has the goggles on
[2:45:00] <+CCCPKi> has pat beaten it already?
[2:45:00] <+zaworldo> I missed the beginning of this stream
[2:45:13] <dan_g_v> Pat beat it, yeah
[2:45:14] <Megapikman132> @zaworldo Dante is back
[2:45:16] <%apostateCourier> ugh the gross goo tubes in mission... 9? are awful
[2:45:21] <Bust_ER> @angriestpat whats the trick to getting those flashy royal guards that do extra damage?
[2:45:23] <+zaworldo> @Megapikman132 h o w
[2:45:24] <kingbaconcrispy> @zaworldo Pat played V and then a bunch of Dante
[2:45:26] <KingVantq> @CCCPKi he beat the game 3 times since last month
[2:45:28] <Megapikman132> Also V is part (half?) of Vergil?
[2:45:29] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @CCCPKi not on stream, off stream he has beaten it 4 times
[2:45:30] <Dragon_Batman> Kinda like Bayonetta's saw weapons in 2?
[2:45:32] <pabblloooot> devils cry
[2:45:33] <dan_g_v> Pat hasn't found out what the super expessive taunts are
[2:45:36] <%DK_Rance> @Megapikman132 yep
[2:45:37] <KZN02> Would it be cool if Cavalier could transform like Joanna / Anat from Pesrona 5
[2:45:39] <NivekMD> like the chainsaws in bayo
[2:45:40] <%TheMattman1313> Oh god that's exactly the same shotgun noise as in REmake 2
[2:45:41] <blackdragonz> so cavalier is basically like the Red Queen?
[2:45:44] <Artista_AF> is beyond nice
[2:45:49] <+Ninja_Kareca> @zaworldo Dante got beaten, Rebelion broke, V is Vergil's human form, Uriel is Vergil's demon form, Pat went to pee
[2:45:58] <+Austinck> In jojo part 5 I haven't wachted much did the muda punch fest happen?

[2:46:14] <%dreamfillah> not yet, next week is Shark and Tongue @Austinck
[2:46:15] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Bayo chainsaws are my favorite weapons in that game

[2:46:33] <gekizenbu> Sparda smacked that ass, its a good motto
[2:46:34] <callsigneagle01> I'm not a fan of Sparda's design, looks too clunky
[2:46:36] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> 7 page muda has not happened yet. come back in like 10 weeks

[2:46:51] <callsigneagle01> But I miss Alastor and Force Edge more
[2:46:51] <Hyphixsys> don't worry, Rebllion gets replaced by Alastor in DMC1 Kappa
[2:46:53] <$839ricky> @angriestpat would Dante’s human half be an overweight man-child named D?
[2:46:54] <%dreamfillah> i am so hype for Metallica fight
[2:46:54] <alcors_wisdom> good thing someone built this at some point for some reason
[2:46:54] <Huntercd> Where is Paige?
[2:46:57] <$birdfella> Dante should get a sword named after himself
[2:46:58] <%PlainSimpleTailor> mmm...grape flavored
[2:47:02] <heckingjen> ok but where are we and why did someone build a giant blood fountain puzzle
[2:47:06] <%ThatGuyfromMars> wait so what was the point of Virgil taking Nero's arm if he was gonna split himself anyway
[2:47:07] <%Agent_For_Hire> THE BLUHD

[2:47:21] <fairore> my cusin just ask why has her name lol
[2:47:22] <$ooblagis> Here's a question. Why does the backdoor to Dante's house need four fucking blood pools to open?
[2:47:26] <%DK_Rance> @ThatGuyfromMars the hand was the sword

[2:47:51] <+GeneralHysterics> Rebellion is such an iconic weapon that it still hasn’t hit me that it’s gone. Like, they’re gonna bring it back right? They have to? I’m cool with either way, I just feel like rebellion has to come back.
[2:47:53] <%0dokuro> Go back to hell lol
[2:47:53] <KZN02> Dante fights the monsters and Layton solves the puzzles

[2:49:46] <+mangomanfred> someone posted the taunts o. the dmc subreddit
[2:49:46] <+GeneralHysterics> Imagine trying to be threatening after you get goofed like that.
[2:49:49] <Amasepyt> this is just those guys from DmC
[2:49:51] <lethallylactic> Nothin' personnel kid
[2:49:52] <+GeneralHysterics> I’d just die of embarrassment
[2:49:53] <mdmzerop> dantes face kind of bugs me

[2:50:23] <%nanov11> that effect is cool as fuck
[2:50:24] <callsigneagle01> Jesus it looks like his moves are glitching and cancelling each-other out
[2:50:25] <%TheMattman1313> That's the masked teleporting swordsman from DmC
[2:50:25] <AutechreTwinAphex> so glad at how DMC5 turned out - DmC is legit trash compared to this
[2:50:25] <+VektorTroika> since when did the arbiter learn to teleport?
[2:50:26] <+zaworldo> yo
[2:50:26] <rosemon5001> the teleporting reminds me a bit of those red and white mask weebs from DmC
[2:50:27] <+zaworldo> YO
[2:50:28] <striderzer0> is this a re-imangine of those fire and ice enemies from DmC?

[2:50:59] <%Trabnaxes> did I miss the cowboy?

[2:53:01] <HeavyC4> is that a statue of SPARDA?
[2:53:02] <+peri_d0t> @parrycat exactly
[2:53:04] <%kiiiirsten> its cummies
[2:53:05] <AutechreTwinAphex> @ParryCat it doesn't play great really - it's a dumbed down Devil May Cry game without taunts or styles
[2:53:06] <+oOZtkOo> i was just thinking that
[2:53:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> who built this
[2:53:11] <%JoltyJ> How does King Kummies Work?
[2:53:13] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> slaves?
[2:53:15] <wsintai> This is my stand; KIN CUMMIES!

[2:53:18] <Prevot> sparda woke up to that smell
[2:53:22] <striderzer0> im surprised that they didnt make real distorted impact an official feature
[2:53:23] <Hyphixsys> @Sphincter_Spelunker probably his worshippers
[2:53:26] <dukenux> She's a Cummies Queeeeeeeen
[2:53:27] <+ChrisAlgoo> HOW DOES IT WORK
[2:53:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> so slaves
[2:53:29] <+Shastafield> PogChamp
[2:53:29] <+jkobe34> sparda just casually having a blood fountain
[2:53:33] <+Ninja_Kareca> @angriestpat you forgot Sparda was into CBT? Jebaited
[2:53:33] <Hyphixsys> @Sphincter_Spelunker LUL
[2:53:34] <tiger_guard> but but but you guys were doing an LP
[2:53:35] <hassanico> Do you think Dante's offended part of Vergil declared himself "king"
[2:53:36] <KZN02> Period blood?
[2:53:36] <tiger_guard> XD
[2:53:48] <+VektorTroika> @jkobe34 "Hey man it's tradition!"
[2:53:53] <Sajallday> Where is this area?
[2:53:56] <tiger_guard> *a
[2:53:58] <%0dokuro> any devil thats anybody needs a blood fountain
[2:54:00] <%dreamfillah> GOD
[2:54:06] <KZN02> Shoryuken!
[2:54:09] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Very cool
[2:54:10] <%mastertwin2> That is disgusting
[2:54:11] <%dreamfillah> real impact
[2:54:14] <waifoong98> But does it oneshot tho Kappa
[2:54:14] <Rosy_Joan> You think Sparda ever had sex in his bug form?
[2:54:16] <%px120> I could FEEL that
[2:54:18] <%maskedriderhero> ye
[2:54:21] <alcors_wisdom> "honey dont you think the blood fountain is a bit much" "but dear i need to impress my demon friends when they come over for poker"
[2:54:22] <Ahk_90> that is a significant amount of damage
[2:54:24] <%nanov11> if you had the tech to have a blood fountain you would
[2:54:24] <dukenux> WOOHOO
[2:54:26] <ParryCat> @autechretwinaphex it's dumbed down a bit that's why you play it on hard
[2:54:28] <%lloyddboy> KlNG KUMMIES NO NORYUKU
[2:54:29] <mdmzerop> has pat already finished the game?
[2:54:36] <%thackattack00> yes
[2:54:39] <Hammerknife> isn't he too old to be riding motorcycles at his age
[2:54:40] <hassanico> @mdmzerop 3 times

[2:54:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> on stream, no

[2:54:45] <Rosy_Joan> hes finished it 3 times
[2:54:48] <AutechreTwinAphex> @ParryCat but that doesn't make the mechanics any more interesting - there's nothing as interesting as Nero's Exceed system in DmC
[2:54:52] <alcors_wisdom> @nanov11 bold of you to assume i dont
[2:54:52] <Huntercd> Why didn't Makoto use her motorcycle like this?

[2:55:45] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @alcors_wisdom I was totally on board with her. Then she joined the party @ThatGuyfromMars

[2:56:14] <+Sigmatub> You dont
[2:56:14] <alcors_wisdom> @Sphincter_Spelunker naw fuck her top to bottom why couldnt we have her sister
[2:56:16] <%lloyddboy> AND FUCK KONAMI
[2:56:17] <dan_g_v> but, good whips, tho
[2:56:21] <+Sigmatub> Konami is fucking dead
[2:56:22] <+VektorTroika> what about BLOODSTAINED
[2:56:23] <qo_op> igavania will save us
[2:56:25] <Hyphixsys> KONAMI BAD
[2:56:28] <AutechreTwinAphex> @ParryCat the pull mechanic is overused and it becomes a continuous repetition of having to use that for the right enemies, on top of all the color coded Simon Says gameplay
[2:56:30] <Hydrapissed> Who said that?
[2:56:30] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @839ricky possible, but unlikely, Bayo is sega/nintendo and DMC is Capcom
[2:56:31] <fattyboy067> except for DaS3
[2:56:33] <anuchallengertwitch> not sure if you already know this, but you can break of the Chao's scales if you shoot/ attack them while spinning.

[2:59:56] <AutechreTwinAphex> @ParryCat I didn't find the fixes/additions in Dmc DE to be enough to salvage the game; my issues with the game were on a gameplay level, the narrative/story is best skipped so for its own sake I don't use that as the main criticism since it's so easy to mark it down for that
[2:59:57] <Ipsenscastle> yeaaahhhh

[3:05:34] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> cheer2500 So, I have a confession to make. I have played this gameplay style before, but it was not ACTUALLY DMC. I, being a poor child with no wider frame of reference, did not know of this game series at all. The movie adaptation of Van Helsing, turns out, was an EXACT rip-off of Devil May Cry gameplay, and I just NEVER knew. Have to say, sexy as Hugh Jackman is, I now know this is the superior version, and I will be playing these games personally very soon, as I actually enjoyed the gameplay.
[3:05:34] <Prevot> monkaS

[3:20:52] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Wow
[3:20:52] <AutechreTwinAphex> fact is that GOW 2018 does not even have one character with gameplay as complex or refined as Dante, and yet DMC5 has three characters - it's pretty evident that Santa Monica puts most of its money into graphics and cutscenes and gameplay gets paid lip service

[3:23:53] <AzureSkyKnight> Want to know what the point of Nero is, keep watching and you'll find out.
[3:23:54] <MyDarkStorm> Just give it a moment

[3:24:18] <MyDarkStorm> ,oh
[3:24:20] <AutechreTwinAphex> @AngriestPat nice job BTW giving CliffyB a taste of his own medicine - that was fun and gratifying to see
[3:24:22] <HeavyC4> R is faster and no super armor
[3:24:27] <Hydrapissed> Super beast super beast something something preist
[3:24:28] <+Exyoh> So Vergil didn't get the memo that being a hybrid is the REAL big huge. Rebellion was made for the hype-ass limit break.
[3:24:29] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> More like cavaliere RAWR XD
[3:24:30] <%PlainSimpleTailor> something something Pat's ass gets greased?
[3:24:34] <Jalexster> @AngriestPat I believe the R variant lacks super armor but gets an air-stinger of some sort
[3:24:36] <%korth367> wat hat gun do
[3:24:42] <blackdragonz> so now i ask; who is the strongest in DMC
[3:24:43] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Something something with a priest
[3:24:44] <42nfl19> This last line involved a priest
[3:24:46] <%Niney_Who> Is it that it looks like the bike from 3?
[3:24:49] <%Niney_Who> Is that it?
[3:24:49] <Fujiwara_92> USE FAUST
[3:24:50] <HeavyC4> @Exyoh so this put to rest that vergil was the favortive son for Sparda Kappa
[3:24:54] <fabo_joyful> When they kiss
[3:24:58] <ParryCat> @blackdragonz Dante
[3:24:59] <bit_guardian> @angriestpat More speed less armor is the difference.
[3:25:01] <OmniSTylez> oh shizz dmc
[3:25:03] <MyDarkStorm> @AngriestPat So you cant get Rebellion back?
[3:25:05] <%Kiyosuki> look at this bloodborne enemy
[3:25:06] <suikudo> We are going to need to make a list of people who can beat SIN DT Dante
[3:25:08] <+Bad1uck> Well that's horrifying

[3:25:17] <$ooblagis> @MyDarkStorm You get it in NG+

[3:25:35] <suikudo> @peri_d0t That is hilarious
[3:25:36] <+Exyoh> @HeavyC4 hey, maybe Vergil could be cool like his bro if he wasn't such a power hound
[3:25:36] <person181> and as we all know, red means fast
[3:25:36] <%nitronLVIII> red = fast
[3:25:39] <Justaer> cavalier R doesnt have super armor i think
[3:25:40] <%nanov11> red = fast color
[3:25:43] <joniroquai> Red wuns go fasta

[3:28:07] <Jalexster> So what's replaced by those inputs?
[3:28:11] <troxcree> So Dante's never gonna be in a DMC game again is what you're telling me.
[3:28:12] <%Niney_Who> NON-AI PogChamp
[3:28:14] <AutechreTwinAphex> @Clyderso yeah I really like Lady's playstyle - hope they are able to fit her in

[3:28:16] <%VantomPayne> thats a hongkong player
[3:28:17] <vergil_angelo> @angriestpat Sin Devil Trigger has Dante fly because Dante is best when he’s in the air
[3:28:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Expectations, Exceeded
[3:28:19] <ReDexuz> where's dancemacabre
[3:28:20] <%Kiyosuki> I'm enjoying the Capcom redemption arc but still sort of cautious, its not the first time they've had a redemption arc

[3:29:19] <%LokimenD> @AngriestPat you forgot dr faust?
[3:29:19] <+DevinMayCry> Free real estate
[3:29:20] <Valentinius_Anodyne> BIGGEST style
[3:29:20] <%Ion_Laser> VoteYea VoteYea VoteYea
[3:29:20] <+stelfury> I'm moist
[3:29:21] <Hyphixsys> Capcom has been doing well, but they need to make anotehr Breath of Fire BibleTHump
[3:29:22] <Ninjagregory98> Show off for the Japanese players
[3:29:22] <%px120> This just feels unfair
[3:29:25] <%superc37> HE SAID IT
[3:29:25] <+ahegotrigger> you make it look easy Pat
[3:29:27] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Not good enough pat
[3:29:32] <+Ninja_Kareca> did Dante just speak japanese?
[3:29:41] <%px120> Like, I feel almost sorry for the demons
[3:29:42] <vergil_angelo> @angriestpat How do you Dance Macabre?
[3:29:44] <+DevinMayCry> Bloody Palace is gonna be amazing
[3:29:50] <LordOfThePoultry> @angriestpat can we get some faust gameplay?
[3:29:50] <%superc37> Dante said "Guts and Honor"
[3:29:50] <Archmortal> Blue Rose is still my favorite gun to use by far
[3:29:53] <+VektorTroika> that's a funny way to say Dante
[3:29:56] <hassanico> Dante stop swearing!
[3:29:58] <+Qsmash_> Dante says bad words now
[3:29:59] <dukenux> This is like when Doomguy obtains BFG
[3:29:59] <anuchallengertwitch> Dante's sss taunt has him say "Guts and honor" like in Dmc1
[3:30:01] <Finaldragoon> DANTE SWORE?
[3:30:03] <buffmurffy> dante has a potty mouth now
[3:30:04] <striderzer0> so he is playing with someones ghost data?
[3:30:04] <thebehatted> Sin Dante is allowed to say shit
[3:30:06] <Supabait> but does dante have an arm lazer cannon? 😡
[3:30:08] <+tigerfang86> SWEARS????
[3:30:08] <%Kiyosuki> unfortunately (or fortunately) we'd probably see another Darkstalkers game before we see another, non phone BOF
[3:30:08] <+Leroytirebiter> by the time you've finished blowing your load with DMC5, Sekiro will be out
[3:30:10] <dukenux> the demons are the underdog now
[3:30:11] <+Pendragwn> @AngriestPat How do you play DMC2?
[3:30:12] <T_Sasquatch> honestly its a super mental gang bang in my head playing different chracters almost every mission
[3:30:13] <+ahegotrigger> Dant never swears
[3:30:14] <suikudo> Eww gross he hasnt flushed the toilets in the devil may cry building in like a month!
[3:30:15] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Isn't this M rated?
[3:30:16] <%Kiyosuki> but hey you never know
[3:30:16] <Ipsenscastle> dante poop jokes
[3:30:16] <+ahegotrigger> Dante
[3:30:17] <FuqBoiSlim> stop gassing him up he doesn't need it
[3:30:17] <+Sigmatub> Dante said a bad word woopsR
[3:30:19] <%0dokuro> not in my christian devil game
[3:30:20] <pshuuu> fost
[3:30:21] <%AbnormalVoid> FAWST
[3:30:27] <Hyphixsys> @0dokuro Kappa
[3:30:28] <mayorrev> Dante swore???
[3:30:28] <TheValiantBob> what style is Pat using, swordmaster?
[3:30:31] <Gogeta957> Capcom: "So we gave Dante his Majin form but balenced it"
[3:30:36] <valentinostand> what about that bay cowboy hat any good combos?
[3:30:39] <SsHomes> he's been swearing since 3. he swore more in this game though
[3:31:01] <theobble> PogChamp
[3:31:04] <bashful_bard> Here we see dante styling on 5 of this massive enemy
[3:31:05] <SsHomes> and used more coarse words
[3:31:06] <anuchallengertwitch> Dante is swearing because he's really upset his brother's staring shit again.
[3:31:12] <waifoong98> abuse that SSSS
[3:31:13] <%0dokuro> He looks tired so I expect for of the swearing
[3:31:17] <+spookeyskeleman> no Quad S
[3:31:18] <SsHomes> not a fan of it either
[3:31:22] <$SleepyMaribo> YOOO
[3:31:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Also Capcom: "Patty is calling Dante to tell him she's 18 now."
[3:31:26] <Hydrapissed> DEAR god
[3:31:27] <shaneok64> PogChamp
[3:31:29] <$SleepyMaribo> Pat is so happy!
[3:31:30] <Shishi1205> This is fucked
[3:31:31] <Hydrapissed> sin real impact
[3:31:34] <Hyphixsys> DEMOLISHED
[3:31:34] <%superc37> THIS IS SO FUCKIN BUSTED
[3:31:38] <+Pendragwn> @Sphincter_Spelunker who is patty
[3:31:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Man, look at Pat just casually styling over here
[3:31:45] <+Judeknight> RIP
[3:31:48] <LordOfThePoultry> pats going crazy with power WutFace
[3:31:49] <kingdomkey92> I think that Demon literally exploded
[3:31:51] <+Ninja_Kareca> SINFUL DISTORTION PogChamp
[3:31:52] <HoIlywood_SN> so you're telling me Dante is going to perform a Sin Devil Trigger on Patty for her 18th birthday
[3:31:53] <+Exyoh> That IS quad S. Maintaining a triple gives you free SDT
[3:31:55] <necrocannibal2> Dante is swearing because this game is clearly inspired in parts by DmC and anyone who says otherwise is lying to themselves
[3:31:58] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Someone report for abuse!
[3:31:59] <SourceHorse> can the sin meter be upgraded?
[3:32:00] <+CookieCutter007> Bonewheel skeletons too op
[3:32:02] <dukenux> oh thank god, he still can get hurt
[3:32:03] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Pendragwn Anime. She's just some girl that hangs out sometimes
[3:32:05] <AutechreTwinAphex> @Sphincter_Spelunker yeah if you read the datalogs in the game and read the one for Patty - it says she is popular with the boys but she turns them all down - probably has a thing for Dante
[3:32:06] <%Kiyosuki> Patty's some girl from the anime, who I'd honestly rather forget and Dante seemed to agree.
[3:32:07] <theteaLordSamurai> b-u-s-t-e-d
[3:32:09] <%0dokuro> Watch the Demons melt!
[3:32:12] <+peri_d0t> @necrocannibal2 for real
[3:32:15] <Toxrockz2k14> use judgement whan SDT bar is low
[3:32:15] <+Pendragwn> @Sphincter_Spelunker yeyeye animu
[3:32:20] <hassanico> Is the Balrog kinda closer to the Gilgamesh in fighting style? @AngriestPat
[3:32:25] <TioXyco> Rev i-- AAAAAAH!
[3:32:27] <SnaKemuho> @necrocannibal2 not in a million years
[3:32:31] <SsHomes> it's inspired by dmc as much as the other games
[3:32:37] <$ooblagis> Dante is so fucking good
[3:32:40] <ReDexuz> what a nice music this section has
[3:32:42] <+tigerfang86> Jesus CHRIST
[3:32:42] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat you make it look easy, until you don't. :)

[3:32:49] <dukenux> SUBALUWA
[3:32:52] <bashful_bard> Dude cavelier is fucking crazy
[3:32:57] <+Exyoh> DmC might not be canon, but Itsuno still got experience from making it, so you're not wrong
[3:32:59] <%Gogogolem> Okay i beat it and i am here now
[3:33:00] <+Bad1uck> Motorcycle prop shredder!
[3:33:14] <%px120> @AngriestPat So, is there a point ot normal DT, or do you just use the gauge to charge up Sin?
[3:33:19] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Pat thats another player
[3:33:20] <$ooblagis> Co-Op time
[3:33:22] <+AndeOneNine> The Japanese have arrived.
[3:33:22] <hassanico> that;s a person right?
[3:33:24] <dekkitout> Ft. V
[3:33:26] <42nfl19> Bro-op time
[3:33:26] <cerberuscarmine> yeee
[3:33:26] <%claudesavegely> yep thats a person
[3:33:30] <Dragon_Batman> This is amazing
[3:33:30] <Nobuwaroo> so does the sin trigger pop only lasts long enough for one action/combo?
[3:33:31] <dukenux> well that one guy was clearly inspired by Monsoon, and the city looks kinda close to the one in DmC so yeah
[3:33:32] <%Ion_Laser> @hassanico yeah
[3:33:33] <%Kiyosuki> The experience we all got from DmC was the Vergil Mobile (tm)
[3:33:34] <waifoong98> WOAH SSS
[3:33:35] <$MetalPanic> put style switching in FF14!
[3:33:38] <Megapikman132> @px120 only normal DT heals
[3:33:39] <irfan_> V is on SSS rn
[3:33:39] <thedrummaestro> wtf is happening
[3:33:42] <Shishi1205> Wait is the spoiler costume a straught up vergil costum for V?
[3:33:48] <FenixSeraph> it's green
[3:33:50] <dukenux> As in, It's just London, but the general vibe is there
[3:34:00] <%Aztec50> oh fuck i should not watch this cause spoilers
[3:34:05] <etalmeta> @Nobuwaroo only the 4S version
[3:34:09] <SsHomes> V meter gain is broken with nightmare or just using shadow and griffon. needs rebalancing imo
[3:34:13] <waifoong98> LUL

[3:34:42] <$MetalPanic> Gold orb is a tetrahedron
[3:34:42] <Prevot> I can't believe V is ACTUALLY just Vergin
[3:34:42] <necrocannibal2> @buffmurffy nothing can look as bad as that, come on
[3:34:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Where's that person in chat who was saying that costumes aren't spoilers? LUL
[3:34:48] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> So as pretty as this game is. The muted colors are starting to blend together now
[3:34:52] <%Kiyosuki> lol Vergin
[3:34:52] <Ahk_90> this was insane
[3:34:53] <%Gogogolem> its super obvious.
[3:34:54] <+Sigmatub> @buffmurffy what do you mean that looked great Kappa
[3:34:55] <ParryCat> Who thinks Virgil will be playable later on?
[3:34:55] <%superc37> Wait, how do you get that costume? is it SoS?
[3:35:00] <SnaKemuho> man, it sucks that this is like the only mission where you can co-op
[3:35:02] <Shishi1205> V is actually virgin vergil, while urizen is chad vergil @AngriestPat
[3:35:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Then yellow shows up. Ow my eyes
[3:35:08] <Hyphixsys> rave music
[3:35:14] <AzureSkyKnight> I didnt realize those spinning enemies are like the one from DmC, where you had to shot to kill them
[3:35:15] <suikudo> Was that about muted color?
[3:35:16] <%Jesseyblack> ORB
[3:35:17] <necrocannibal2> I can't believe V is the aborted fetus in DmC
[3:35:17] <%Gogogolem> gonna have to work to unlock those mega expense taunts though
[3:35:23] <SsHomes> it's the lightning more than the muted color
[3:35:23] <AstralBlad3> DmC5 is great
[3:35:23] <%0dokuro> oh god
[3:35:24] <necrocannibal2> from*
[3:35:29] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[3:35:31] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> So V, being all sweet and stuff, is just because he's missing his power-hungry side? That's a really interesting way to show Vergil's humanity.
[3:35:31] <person181> no wonder i like V more
[3:35:32] <TyrantBelial> the fuck is this beat music?
[3:35:39] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @suikudo who said that. I'm blind now
[3:35:41] <$Corporate_Redeemer> Which one gets to keep the kid though?
[3:35:43] <FenixSeraph> this game's OST is great
[3:35:46] <+Ninja_Kareca> @angriestpat would you eat a red orb irl?
[3:35:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> I just realized V is Neros Dad.
[3:35:48] <$SGrim> He's a DEMON Dante rooBlank
[3:35:53] <OldOnyx> ^
[3:36:01] <suikudo> Whos talking?
[3:36:03] <Shishi1205> that looked strange
[3:36:03] <VRNK> i will say, i love the font design for this game
[3:36:06] <fazoburquina> @AngriestPat does this mean that Vergil was a goth growing up that became a prep boy after he went full I NEED POWER ?
[3:36:06] <Ahk_90> that was goofy
[3:36:06] <person181> if you take the human out of a prep you're taking the goth out of them aprently
[3:36:09] <Erictron4000> Where is Dante’s dad?
[3:36:10] <+alphonseisbest> ^
[3:36:15] <%0dokuro> Looks tasty
[3:36:15] <%El_Desperad0> Nero has 3 daddies
[3:36:17] <Hyphixsys> GROSS
[3:36:18] <dragoon001914> Demon blood
[3:36:19] <+DevinMayCry> Red Orbs are made out of Demon blood
[3:36:19] <anuchallengertwitch> Devil sword Dante is literally powered by revengance.
[3:36:19] <+cursedwithadhd> its like a combo between the inner hollow from GOW2 and the collector base in ME2
[3:36:21] <%PlainSimpleTailor> So Sparda is Big Boss, Dante is Solid and Vergil is Liquid?
[3:36:21] <+DeRedBaron> i thought red orbs were legit demon blood
[3:36:21] <kingdomkey92> Demon Blood
[3:36:24] <42nfl19> So did rebellion further combine the human and demon half of Dante? @AngriestPat
[3:36:24] <$MetalPanic> IRL red orbs are far too crunchy
[3:36:24] <%0dokuro> YES
[3:36:25] <SsHomes> he "died" probably like how v is dying
[3:36:25] <waifoong98> but you like to litter Kappa
[3:36:25] <$SGrim> @rumtumtugnutz you you're saying Nero should call V daddy? KappaPride
[3:36:26] <SnaKemuho> @professor_dr_muffins I think that's just what Vergil is like behind his stoic facade, a nerd who likes poetry and goth
[3:36:26] <Dalkalopagus> Dante's dad is busy with the CBT
[3:36:26] <Enryuan> He didn't say no
[3:36:27] <+Exyoh> Dante's dad is Demon Jesus

[3:49:02] <+Ninja_Kareca> WAKE V UP
[3:49:04] <$ooblagis> There was also a poet called Blake Williams at the same time

[3:49:08] <LordOfThePoultry> tell me more CoolStoryBob
[3:49:10] <+zaworldo> V is unmotivated Vergil
[3:49:11] <+DeRedBaron> and if you played the demo you get extra orbs
[3:49:11] <$birdfella> Billiam Blorb

[3:49:36] <Shishi1205> How do the demo robrs function in the full game? @AngriestPat
[3:49:37] <saltyvest> Those rorbs are for shitty journalists

[3:50:48] <%maskedriderhero> When will they make a game based solely on V's summoning mechanics and combat?
[3:50:50] <Nina96> staring pat!?
[3:50:50] <saltyvest> The nico music makes me feel like I'm playing some creepy ZONE shit

[3:50:59] <zanzibarian_hamster> Hey Pat how you findin V?
[3:50:59] <TheValiantBob> does the entire game take place inside the tree? as cool as it is, I could see it feeling a bit stale if the entire game looks like this

[3:51:17] <necrocannibal2> how can someone named Nicoletta Goldstein be a redneck?
[3:51:23] <KingVantq> @Shishi1205 if you have demo save data depending on if you played both demos you get 30k or 60k orbs at the start
[3:51:24] <necrocannibal2> do they ever explain that plothole? Kappa
[3:51:26] <Timesteel> pc got like 100k rorbs for preordering
[3:51:30] <+Ell1ot> is this the bed of chaos?

[3:51:38] <$GoogleyGareth> Damn right
[3:51:41] <$ooblagis> Enviroment design is the one shortcoming of this game
[3:51:44] <SnaKemuho> yeah it most of these look too similar
[3:51:45] <zecht89> about 80% inside the tree tbh
[3:51:48] <townzzzzz> don't touch the floor part 2
[3:51:49] <$GoogleyGareth> I couldn't do it myself
[3:51:50] <LordOfThePoultry> thats what you said before
[3:51:51] <person181> maybe like 3-4 hours
[3:51:51] <dan_g_v> retry time!

[3:51:53] <dukenux> THose fucking secret mission sigils are so Berserk
[3:51:53] <Tucker0603> you said that on like 3 others
[3:51:54] <%mastertwin2> Gamestop gave 100k rorbs to preorders
[3:51:56] <%dave323dave> i can't believe he got it on his first try
[3:51:58] <+DevinMayCry> The floor is lava!
[3:51:59] <Coylie3> Oh, this one. I watched another streamer struggle with this for 2 hours.
[3:52:03] <dukenux> oooh
[3:52:04] <+Kataiser> You can just sprint off the ledge first, then bird, then use the cane teleport.
[3:52:06] <Toxic_Phazon> So is this tree just that tree from Naruto?
[3:52:07] <+VektorTroika> The floor is BLUDD
[3:52:08] <+Kataiser> EZ

[3:52:19] <Soulbishop> @ooblagis I have been saying this whole stream environment looks like Monster Hunter World missing zones
[3:52:24] <saltyvest> Imma be real, the rorb purchase probably makes the game WAY too easy
[3:52:28] <dukenux> Flashbacks to that DMC 3 airborne mission

[4:30:07] <kingbaconcrispy> @yourliteraldog Iheard about it. A friend of mine worked there.
[4:30:08] <%Trabnaxes> @AngriestPat so is Phantom not in this game so he can show up in DMC2?
[4:30:11] <+zaworldo> HE KNOWS
[4:30:12] <+bubbli97> !uptime
[4:30:13] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 30m.
[4:30:18] <+zaworldo> HE K N O W S IT'S HIM
[4:30:18] <Restainly> How far r we into the stream?
[4:30:19] <ChineseNininga> big evil smirk
[4:30:19] <%hntronium> Nero stands for Dead Weight
[4:30:21] <necrocannibal2> I hate enemy DT, it's literally just anti-fun trigger
[4:30:23] <Supabait> "I only let you take on Sanctus because he was smalltime." -Dante
[4:30:23] <%skizzuto> show off Faust!
[4:30:26] <anuchallengertwitch> Dante in a nutshell: my game
[4:30:26] <Hydrapissed> also lady and trish go help v ya fookers
[4:30:27] <person181> make phantom a stand
[4:30:27] <TioXyco> why is Dante going down the Satan's asshole?
[4:30:27] <+timblenaut> !lies
[4:30:28] <powerprotoman> phantoms too buys workign for bayo
[4:30:29] <+chaumiester> Is Lucia in this game?
[4:30:31] <raimsurion> So what exactly does co-op do in this? Just open up pathways sometimes?
[4:30:31] <SnaKemuho> Man, I hoped V would get more summons
[4:30:33] <mothdude> Phantom got stuck in Bayonetta-verse.
[4:30:34] <vVAstrAVv> fuck phantom
[4:30:46] <+DeRedBaron> sadly if we wanna use phantom in any form we'd have to play bayo
[4:30:50] <vVAstrAVv> hes in bayo now dont overuse him
[4:30:52] <OrochiSheewa> aww
[4:30:57] <dan_g_v> so, this means Phantom is in the game, right?
[4:30:57] <+Strogg> Shadow could've been a mini phantom but instead we got fatto catto @AngriestPat
[4:30:58] <yourliteraldog> @kingbaconcrispy I recommend it if your really high or just want to be closer to the sweet embrace of death
[4:31:01] <%Lithdoran> But Faust is great for RORB farming!
[4:31:02] <%Afterman_> good for making cash
[4:31:03] <%El_Desperad0> Same. It has only 1 use
[4:31:05] <jobbedbone> Featuring Kylo Ren from the Star Wars Franchise!
[4:31:06] <+TomServal> That tree sphincter Dante is on looks so ugly.
[4:31:07] <+Ninja_Kareca> wait, Faust is a gun????
[4:31:09] <+DeRedBaron> i definately like the idea of Faust
[4:31:09] <Superbro64> there always has to be _one_
[4:31:13] <%0dokuro> Hm, I wonder. Getting a feeling of who might of cut Nero's arm off.
[4:31:15] <Dragon_Batman> time for style god
[4:31:16] <tmix1600> Faust is for money
[4:31:18] <Storm_Samurai> is that the necklace jewel in the handle of the sword?

[4:32:30] <%Lithdoran> @hntronium Last stream he said they were about 3/4ths of the way through. If they had a recording session today, they probably finished it
[4:32:33] <ThorW> @AngriestPat Are you playing on PC or console?
[4:32:33] <dan_g_v> so, Pat has finished the game 4 times already, did you know that?

[4:33:02] <yourliteraldog> @kingbaconcrispy Aw a Nobel's End. Respectable
[4:33:05] <+TomServal> @papafleish Yeah he's been around.
[4:33:05] <%hntronium> @OrochiSheewa Not for dante I think
[4:33:07] <+critfumble_> man i super hope they fake us out and they update with some trish and lady playable sections it kinda sucks that they just sit around and get saved by the dudes
[4:33:07] <%skizzuto> @OrochiSheewa he bought it for nero last time
[4:33:08] <+Bad1uck> With the Ghoulies?
[4:33:10] <LordOfThePoultry> monkaS

[4:33:11] <OrochiSheewa> ah
[4:33:16] <VRNK> woolie's bathroom?
[4:33:19] <dan_g_v> one rorbs missed, everything is ruined
[4:33:41] <kingbaconcrispy> @yourliteraldog What's the voice that Clemps uses in the Nier reviews?
[4:33:48] <tmix1600> Nero can get stupid air
[4:33:48] <mayorrev> KIA ;-;7
[4:33:55] <zanzibarian_hamster> The ultimate dante weapon, 2 pizza cutters that turn into a motor bike
[4:34:07] <theobble> CRAZY?!
[4:34:07] <blackdragonz> also might i add how pat hasnt use his gay cowboy hat at all
[4:34:10] <mothdude> Yeah Pizza woohoo
[4:34:12] <yourliteraldog> yes
[4:34:18] <tmix1600> I break segments with Neros taunt and EX High Time
[4:34:18] <+TomServal> Hey Pat, does the motorcycle weapon count as "Muther!" giving him a bike for his birthday?
[4:34:22] <dan_g_v> very true @zanzibarian_hamster
[4:34:25] <SnaKemuho> DSD is what's gonna break this game
[4:34:26] <%Lithdoran> Je sus
[4:34:32] <jobbedbone> I guess you could call that DANTE'S INFERNO
[4:34:34] <lethallylactic> What does the hat do?
[4:34:35] <dekkitout> It should totally count!
[4:34:43] <YndyouSee> @tomserval of course it does
[4:34:48] <AlexanderTheConquerer> did we get the faust hat cutscene yet
[4:34:50] <tmix1600> @lethallylactic more money
[4:34:51] <+Ninja_Kareca> @lethallylactic shoot rorbs as gay cowboy man
[4:34:52] <Hydrapissed> yo do the boxing doges
[4:34:55] <+Bad1uck> Denied!
[4:34:55] <theobble> guts monkaS
[4:34:56] <suikudo> Choke
[4:34:57] <%Lithdoran> @lethallylactic Faust shoots red orbs, but it also lets you farm rorbs more effectively
[4:35:00] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat you ever plan to look at Far Cry New Dawn? It aint Blood Dragon but its got a kinda similar flavor
[4:35:03] <shevan123> @AngriestPat do you think that if someone does a combo mad for this one, it will be the craziest one of the series
[4:35:03] <necrocannibal2> does this game still have distorted real impact?
[4:35:07] <Gorgodrn> What difficulty is this?
[4:35:12] <mothdude> Devil Hunter
[4:35:15] <babyl0nianr3turn3r> ez
[4:35:17] <%hntronium> Devil Hunter
[4:35:19] <%Lithdoran> @Gorgodrn Devil Hunter
[4:35:25] <Shooterboy23> @shevan123 hell no
[4:35:28] <$ooblagis> It should be mentioned that on DH mode, you can totally just pop Sin DT and clear most of the encounters in this level
[4:35:29] <%0dokuro> Gorb
[4:35:31] <shaneok64> gorb
[4:35:36] <%hntronium> Gyramid
[4:35:39] <mayorrev> pat doesnt like using the cowboy hat?
[4:35:44] <lionmanguy> Finally back, how far along are we?
[4:35:46] <$ooblagis> Because you get loads of white orbs
[4:35:47] <Shooterboy23> combat is much more shallow in this but still crazy
[4:35:52] <%hntronium> Gyramorb
[4:35:54] <%Lithdoran> Nah, Faust is really only for farming
[4:36:02] <jobbedbone> GORBS charlsACV
[4:36:03] <42nfl19> what mission number is this?
[4:36:05] <+Exyoh> If it can get as crazy as DMC4 with Sin DT and Quad S, it's gonna be an all-timer
[4:36:07] <%PunishedMimikyu> i keep on seeing that term. what does 'MAD' sstand for?
[4:36:11] <+Ninja_Kareca> @42nfl19 16
[4:36:15] <TioXyco> oh god the sound when you hit the floor

[4:37:24] <kiryuva> !uptime
[4:37:25] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 37m.
[4:37:27] <Shooterboy23> its so unnecessary to JC as dante in this
[4:37:46] <Soman97> @angriestpat hey pat, how do you already have the Kalina Ann? Did I miss a secret location for it or something?
[4:37:46] <SnaKemuho> @waifoong98 Itsuno said til next time
[4:37:48] <%PunishedMimikyu> I know that, but do the letters M-A-D actually mean? like how AMV means Anime Music Video.
[4:37:52] <waifoong98> ehhhh....
[4:37:59] <SiegeJay> @angriestpat Have you seen the DMC5 TV Spot commercial??? PixelBob PixelBob
[4:38:08] <%flagi64> I just realized that we dont have Cerberus yet.....
[4:38:20] <Fujiwara_92> Music Anime Diveo Kappa
[4:38:25] <yourliteraldog> Holy shit it's like the dev team watched a 5 yearold play with a Dante action figure ,a toy motor cycle, and matches. And found away to put that in the game
[4:38:27] <Dragon_Batman> @Soman97 In Dante's first mission you can pick it up off the ground in a secret room apparently
[4:38:37] <@SSaryn> Many much Devil Triggers sipsipGasm
[4:38:41] <%drops50000> Do I need to play the first Dantes Inferno game to understand this?
[4:38:41] <%AbnormalVoid> fuuuuck
[4:38:42] <Shooterboy23> was anyone else disappointed the cerberus theme kicked in only for a wee bit for the fight in this?
[4:38:44] <%PunishedMimikyu> of coursse, what a fool i am
[4:38:45] <+Bad1uck> Red bug just peaced out
[4:38:54] <%Lithdoran> Yeah, Cerberus and Kalina Ann are 'secrets' kinda
[4:38:55] <+TomServal> @mimikyu92 Yes they have meaning but it's niconico based.
[4:39:17] <MyDarkStorm> Omegalul
[4:39:29] <Soman97> @dragon_batman oh shit, well I need to get on that ASAP
[4:39:33] <%0dokuro> @mimikyu92 MAD is just a more a general AMV or broader
[4:39:35] <+chaumiester> Welp, just read up on Lucia... Wow.... They just wrote her off..... Damn
[4:39:38] <SiegeJay> @tomserval just like CP
[4:39:46] <Them00n> What happened after the last bossfight? I was gone.
[4:39:47] <SnaKemuho> @drops50000 only if you want to know the Satan's big dick lore
[4:39:59] <%drops50000> @SnaKemuho Well yeah
[4:40:00] <+peri_d0t> @chaumiester wait she died?
[4:40:00] <+Xenoska> rawket lawnchair!
[4:40:06] <SiegeJay> @chaumiester what happen to Lucia?
[4:40:08] <%Lithdoran> Fuck Furys
[4:40:13] <Dragon_Batman> @Soman97 when this stream is done you can probably use the Vod. I was super surprised it's like that.
[4:40:26] <Sajallday> Was that finishing move drive?
[4:40:26] <scareqrow0107> @chaumiester And nothing of value was lost
[4:40:30] <%Noponiz> which mission is he at
[4:40:31] <+chaumiester> @peri_d0t No.... Lucia just went back to the Island after DMC2....... and stayed there.... That's it
[4:40:45] <waifoong98> gotta take care of Matia Kappa
[4:40:46] <+peri_d0t> ...wtf Lucia was cool
[4:40:50] <+TomServal> Basically is short for "Madness Video". That's the tl;dr explanation.
[4:40:50] <%Gogogolem> what a great enemy
[4:40:56] <Sunditsu> Wow what super lame way to write off a character LUL
[4:41:05] <Hyphixsys> Omegalul
[4:41:13] <SnaKemuho> Lucia pointed Dante towards Balrog, then Dante didn't catch her signals and she left
[4:41:13] <mayorrev> OMEGALUL
[4:41:14] <waifoong98> Lucia was the real XBlade lads Kappa
[4:41:17] <+moondog_> let's get this out onto a tray...nice
[4:41:21] <jobbedbone> PORB
[4:41:22] <Superbro64> [there is a style beast in your area]
[4:41:27] <+cwuzhear> PORB
[4:41:33] <%Gogogolem> Someone told me there is a reference to the Anime in this game is that true?
[4:41:35] <+chaumiester> @peri_d0t Apparently, before DMC5, when Dante gets Balrog, they meet up again, say hello... and thats it......
[4:41:38] <%0dokuro> Generally MAD is used more in Japanese Media, while AMV are more American edited videos of the same kind.
[4:41:42] <@SSaryn> Definitely gonna need to go over and get all these porbs and borbs next playthrough.
[4:41:46] <saltyvest> LUST. GREED.
[4:41:49] <SsHomes> 4Head
[4:41:50] <SiegeJay> @sunditsu You need to play Yakuza 2 and 5. Highest marks on writing off characters
[4:41:54] <T_Sasquatch> maybe im just tired but i swear once that chicken boss happens the game spikes hard in difficulty
[4:41:57] <+zanzibar_junker> Who mad yamato and rebellion?
[4:41:58] <%Lithdoran> @AngriestPat How do you feel about Legendary Blade Dante vs Rebellion or Sparda. I'm talking about aesthetically less than movelist or functionality why
[4:42:00] <KZN02> Such a lust for power, WWHHHOOOO?!?!?!
[4:42:01] <%Lithdoran> wise*
[4:42:01] <+chaumiester> @Gogogolem Yes, it references Patty and Morrison
[4:42:06] <42nfl19> Can't Sin DT fly? or is more of a hover?
[4:42:06] <Sunditsu> @SiegeJay I'm getting around to it LUL
[4:42:07] <+peri_d0t> @chaumiester thats... insanely disappointing. I was hoping she'd be dlc or something
[4:42:10] <%DK_Rance> PogChamp
[4:42:11] <supersparta333> Just beat the game myself. Man what a ride
[4:42:14] <Dragon_Batman> @Gogogolem Yea more than you'd think.
[4:42:17] <+TomServal> @gogogolem This game makes the anime canon in its beginning.
[4:42:22] <Hidashi13> jesus christ
[4:42:23] <Superbro64> @0dokuro mad stands for what now?
[4:42:24] <necrocannibal2> fuck that's cool

[4:42:42] <scareqrow0107> MAJIN DT
[4:42:45] <T_Sasquatch> Gold orbs were a mistake
[4:42:45] <Toxrockz2k14> show judgement with SDT
[4:42:47] <+RogueCrocodile> @gogogolem and Patty is all like “hey I’m 18 and hot come to my birthday party dante”
[4:42:49] <+Ninja_Kareca> Shin Megami DT
[4:42:52] <+Exyoh> The kid has lines, but Morrison is fully in as supporting cast
[4:42:53] <SnaKemuho> Netflix adaptation Morrison
[4:42:57] <+chaumiester> @peri_d0t She is seen in the Japanese Light Novel Prequel. Thats how they wrap up here story..... Welp.... there's always DLC
[4:43:06] <Zebylth> you guys think there will be a costume for unlimited shin ST?
[4:43:13] <Zebylth> DT*

[4:44:05] <mayorrev> USE THE GAY COWBOY HAT
[4:44:08] <%PunishedMimikyu> a DMC novel sounds like some odd nonsense. like, is it just them talking? I don' see how you could describe DMC fights via text.
[4:44:09] <%0dokuro> Its also a lot older and tends to have more editing then a usual AMV
[4:44:21] <+Ninja_Kareca> DansGame
[4:44:21] <Superbro64> @0dokuro whats "douga" ?
[4:44:22] <cerberuscarmine> rip

[4:44:49] <SnaKemuho> thanks Pat
[4:44:50] <Nazgul240> was this a bad time to rejoin?
[4:44:55] <%0dokuro> Its basically a Japanese formated way of saying "AMV"
[4:44:59] <mothdude> Dante is the biggest gay cowboy.
[4:45:01] <%0dokuro> While "AMV" is more Western
[4:45:02] <+Exyoh> You gonna do it offscreen for completion's sake before tomorrow? @AngriestPat
[4:45:05] <+Ninja_Kareca> so there's one blorb fragment left
[4:45:17] <iamtheTwitchghost> DISMAL
[4:45:18] <%DK_Rance> @mimikyu92 and then dante did a sick flip and said "wahoo pizza time!"

[4:45:46] <+VietcongSamurai> Hell bats are pretty annoying.
[4:45:48] <SiegeJay> @yourliteraldog If you consider the novels non-canon. He is a virgin
[4:45:49] <yourliteraldog> God catholic boi
[4:45:51] <42nfl19> I thought you could shotgun them easily?
[4:45:55] <supersparta333> Yeah these bats aren't great
[4:45:57] <Tha_Mik> Dante used Nevan so Kappa
[4:46:00] <%0dokuro> He just wants to eat pizza man
[4:46:02] <%Gogogolem> @yourliteraldog He's been penetrated by multiple people hes not a virigin.
[4:46:02] <+Ninja_Kareca> Dante is a volcel Jebaited
[4:46:06] <yourliteraldog> Are they canon?
[4:46:06] <SnaKemuho> Dante is outside of realm of binary virginity
[4:46:06] <Tsarwerewolf> Hey Pat
[4:46:07] <Make_me_mad> Dante is a virgin for sure, but I bet Tony Redgrave got all kinds of ass.
[4:46:13] <yourliteraldog> So dante fucks
[4:46:16] <T_Sasquatch> bats , behemoth and the queen empusa . fuck em

[4:47:52] <Tsarwerewolf> And does it work well enough on a 360 controller I play mainly on pcc
[4:47:54] <Thors_Left_Nut> @tsarwerewolf he skip 2
[4:47:54] <+Exyoh> All you need from 2 is, maybe, to watch the cutscenes
[4:47:54] <necrocannibal2> @Rezroc oh god
[4:48:09] <alrobot2014> Sonic Dreams Collection
[4:48:10] <Shooterboy23> @px120 "I guess even you were young once"- Dante to Vergil after they have the talk

[4:49:33] <+cwuzhear> BLORB
[4:49:34] <Shooterboy23> Dante's dick is the most wondered about penis in the history of videogames. 2nd place is Kiryu and maybe Chris Redfield.

[4:49:46] <T_Sasquatch> @Dragon_Batman yup, he throws an explosive rose

[4:50:11] <SnaKemuho> wahoo
[4:50:13] <Rezroc> I dont care what anyone says, Gold Orbs are just Meseta and it signals the return of Phantasy Star somehow FeelsBadMan
[4:50:17] <The_Dudde> i just showed up how does he like the game?
[4:50:25] <dekkitout> Did Pat fall into some time vortex?

[4:50:35] <The_Dudde> nice
[4:50:37] <mothdude> Pat thinks it's the best DMC game.
[4:50:47] <SsHomes> pat is too hasty
[4:50:47] <yourliteraldog> @Shooterboy23 It's fucking massive but since dante thinks sex is gross and has never watched porn he just assumes it's average
[4:50:50] <dukenux> TWO Pats WutFace
[4:50:56] <SnaKemuho> wait, is Balrog also the style announcer
[4:50:57] <%Lithdoran> THREE pats
[4:51:00] <%0dokuro> and it "Invalidates" all of DMC games
[4:51:01] <%El_Desperad0> Gunslinger is the weakest style
[4:51:04] <yourliteraldog> Beyond two Pats
[4:51:07] <%0dokuro> per his words
[4:51:07] <+Exyoh> Balrog totally IS the announcer
[4:51:10] <freedomboyz> how did Dante get belrog??
[4:51:12] <waifoong98> stop fucking yourself Pats LUL
[4:51:13] <$ooblagis> Balrog has a different voice from the style announcer
[4:51:13] <Shooterboy23> @yourliteraldog I have no idea where this meme comes from and i wonder if people actually think this
[4:51:16] <+zaworldo> PAT JUST USE THE SIN TRIGGER. i swear
[4:51:18] <T_Sasquatch> Fuck it , its the best character action game , stylish action whatever the genre is ever made
[4:51:22] <Sunditsu> Gunslinger is for people that liked DMC2 Kappa
[4:51:29] <SsHomes> calm down guys cmon
[4:51:31] <Hyphixsys> @Sunditsu Jebaited
[4:51:37] <SsHomes> being too hasty here
[4:51:54] <SsHomes> need a bit more improvement on the common enemies but it's good
[4:51:55] <necrocannibal2> is DT still useful for getting out of grabs and such?
[4:51:57] <FenixSeraph> butthole seals
[4:51:58] <$valriot> Gunslingers fun for rainstorm, thats about it though
[4:52:00] <+DeaconBluesClues> is he hitting that giant plasma uterus with a motorcycle

[4:52:17] <SnaKemuho> I almost unlocked easy mode here
[4:52:19] <+Robopengy> They say "well" so much in DMC
[4:52:20] <Tsarwerewolf> Is Vergil still a big nerd?
[4:52:23] <DublinRage> Cheevos
[4:52:25] <Stillchr> are you trying to get to the top of the tree?
[4:52:27] <%MusouMiko> gotta fight the boss like babby dante did
[4:52:29] <$GoogleyGareth> Dante's run looks so goofy
[4:52:35] <mothdude> Vergil is confirmed the biggest nerd.
[4:52:38] <Dalkalopagus> vergil is two big nerds now]
[4:52:40] <Shooterboy23> I used sin trigger once when the game told me to but i never used it again cuz that shit is just rage mode
[4:52:45] <+GeneralHysterics> Does this lead to ash lake if you go all the way down?
[4:52:46] <Psyramics> Vergil is such a big nerd that he committed seppuku
[4:52:49] <%Blazymaniac> !uptime
[4:52:49] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 52m.
[4:52:55] <%0dokuro> Vergil cut the virgin out of him so now he's a big chad
[4:52:55] <MyDarkStorm> Is it Cerberus time
[4:53:06] <oAznoUta> @AngriestPat you say you beat this 3 times. how many of those were trying for 100%?

[4:53:22] <FenixSeraph> does Pat have both Kalina Anns
[4:53:22] <alcors_wisdom> cant wait to fight some dragon ass
[4:53:23] <spamtrash> I think it's become something of a taboo to make reference to the Best Friends. It's something people avoid mentioning perhaps out of politeness or just not knowing what came before. I get the Rouge reference; but acknowledging it might be a faux pas.
[4:53:27] <Rezroc> Down the vore hole we go

[4:53:54] <Valdorick> DmC V2 - its a DMC game that takes place entirely on a rocket.

[4:54:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> but sexy hobo grandpa is doing his best
[4:54:42] <Valdorick> Too bad Dante sold Cerberus for pizza money.

[4:54:59] <%Dioliciouss> uh plot twist

[4:55:01] <+Ell1ot> Dante is the biggest dork!
[4:55:02] <Tsarwerewolf> I love it
[4:55:02] <Sunditsu> Dante is now MOTIVATED
[4:55:04] <HeavyC4> Cerebus was a better person than KING Cerebus
[4:55:05] <+CookieCutter007> SourPls

[4:55:07] <%0dokuro> THAT was cool
[4:55:08] <Dragon_Batman> This looks great
[4:55:09] <HeavyC4> F this cerebus
[4:55:12] <yourliteraldog> Was that a mushroom cloud?
[4:55:12] <%RageKingDomo> lmao Capcom knows Tekken
[4:55:13] <SnaKemuho> @valdorick original Cerberus was broken by Balrog actually
[4:55:14] <%El_Desperad0> Fanservice done right
[4:55:18] <Hydrapissed> jesus that looked awesome
[4:55:21] <+alphonseisbest> @yourliteraldog that's not a skin, also Dante is 40
[4:55:25] <Hyphixsys> Music Jebaited
[4:55:27] <suikudo> Is this why Lil V did a cover of the Cerberus song?
[4:55:29] <%ElenaManetta> Fear my flames DEMON hunter
[4:55:32] <Tha_Mik> SourPls
[4:55:36] <+ahegotrigger> you say non stop fan service but I see no titties
[4:55:41] <Tsarwerewolf> I have a question, what order do the games take place in?
[4:55:42] <dekkitout> ^
[4:55:43] <FenixSeraph> oh neat they filter battle dialogue if you have DT on
[4:55:45] <DublinRage> So are we going to get Fire nunchucks from this boss?
[4:55:49] <adamisfruit> YOU’VE GOT NOTHING AND NOTHING’S GOT YOU!
[4:55:52] <Nordguy> o shit is that breakcore
[4:55:54] <oAznoUta> @ahegotrigger I'm sure Plague will get on that later
[4:55:54] <MyDarkStorm> welp
[4:55:55] <SsHomes> 3124
[4:55:56] <%crowsloft77> @ahegotrigger well we saw lady remove her towel
[4:55:58] <necrocannibal2> does this game have elemental damage like 3?
[4:56:00] <+Ninja_Kareca> @ahegotrigger I'm pretty sure Cerberus K has dog titties
[4:56:01] <$ooblagis> Dante was too busy playing on his bike LUL
[4:56:01] <lionmanguy> Just parry it tho
[4:56:04] <%0dokuro> huh, okay so it changes the area
[4:56:04] <Hyphixsys> @Nordguy me love some Amen Break
[4:56:05] <Tsarwerewolf> Where does 5 fit in?
[4:56:05] <Jeemukun> zinogre get back to monster hunter
[4:56:05] <+Bad1uck> "Time to leave!" Sits under boss
[4:56:06] <YndyouSee> Pat looks like to me the whole game is fan service to devil may cry fans
[4:56:08] <Shooterboy23> This game has MGS4 level fan service
[4:56:08] <Fujiwara_92> 3,1,anime,4,5
[4:56:12] <$GoogleyGareth> SWORDTRICKSWORD
[4:56:13] <waifoong98> music isn't fitting at all...
[4:56:14] <person181> man pat's on a really pup snuffing crusade
[4:56:15] <bmj614> Does anyone know what system Pat is playing on?
[4:56:17] <Tsarwerewolf> @Fujiwara_92 thanks
[4:56:24] <%Ion_Laser> @bmj614 pc
[4:56:26] <+RadiantBurrito> pc
[4:56:27] <+DeRedBaron> i love how we get the next sword that wasn't even hinted at in the reveal stuff but now the game wasn't fully over and wasn't the last devil arm we get
[4:56:32] <Hyphixsys> LUL this music is probably composed by DJ Technorch LUL
[4:56:38] <SsHomes> this music and the final mission doesnt fit tbh
[4:56:42] <Tsarwerewolf> These graphics PogChamp
[4:56:43] <%MisterRockett> If you're gonna be so far away from them might as well switch to Gunslinger, no?
[4:56:46] <%0dokuro> Flex tape can fix that
[4:56:48] <waifoong98> @SsHomes yeah...
[4:56:48] <+SimplyPandaz> doggo no
[4:56:49] <SsHomes> did capcom lose the rights to suffer?
[4:56:52] <anuchallengertwitch> I love how Cerberus plays along with Dante's shit talking
[4:56:55] <iamtheTwitchghost> can you do distorted real impact in this
[4:56:57] <oAznoUta> @Hyphixsys points for knowing DJ Technorch
[4:56:59] <Dragon_Batman> Niiiice
[4:56:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[4:57:02] <dekkitout> Now THAT'S a lotta damage
[4:57:03] <yourliteraldog> @alphonseisbest know I was pretending that the reboot was actually cool.
[4:57:05] <suikudo> Thats awsome
[4:57:10] <Hyphixsys> @oAznoUta Kappa
[4:57:11] <%Gogogolem> I am curious how unwatcheable is the Lp of this with woolie only using Royal guard.
[4:57:13] <%Dioliciouss> Again, MUCH OMAGE
[4:57:13] <Artista_AF> double reference!!
[4:57:15] <anuchallengertwitch> OOOO the berial callout
[4:57:15] <SnaKemuho> Nero is a DMC4 reference
[4:57:17] <+CookieCutter007> SourPls
[4:57:19] <$Wisconsinite> cut off it's tail so you can craft the weapon
[4:57:20] <+ahegotrigger> this is like a much cooler version of the dmc 3 cerberus fight
[4:57:20] <+moondog_> remember pat...dmc games are self aware
[4:57:22] <$ooblagis> This fight on DMD is probably totally fucked
[4:57:24] <Valentinius_Anodyne> "Berial? I think I left him back home"
[4:57:24] <Shooterboy23> Fight goes on for too long and cerberus starts talking about Bayonetta bosses Kappa
[4:57:29] <%Jackeral> So i feel that its fitting that this boss fight was my first death in DMCV
[4:57:29] <MyDarkStorm> Well hes not wrong
[4:57:33] <Rezroc> THUNDERDOME!
[4:57:38] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Feel the storm?

[4:57:50] <%PunishedMimikyu> how much lightning is there in hell tho?
[4:57:55] <SaltiestAlex> Aw man they didnt use the dmc 3 cerberus theme

[5:16:37] <+DeRedBaron> welp can't have anymore DMC, space is the limit
[5:16:38] <$GoogleyGareth> Dante doesn't like being responsible and Nero doesn't want to deal with a father suddenly existing
[5:16:38] <Shraquet> Cinematic frame rate drop.

[5:16:49] <%BakedPretzels> is that one of those weirdo not Pokemon from sun and moon
[5:16:51] <+Ell1ot> Dante is the kind of person to put off telling Nero about his dad because the pizza delivery guy came

[5:16:53] <+onyxgun> there's hits of that moment in DMC 4
[5:16:53] <+Grey_Frog> Honestly, the fact they never talked about it and there's no reason for Nero to know Dante had a brother, it's actually quite possible Nero thought he was Dante's illegitimate kid up until now.
[5:16:55] <$nademonkey1100> MONOLOGUE
[5:16:55] <+MrTurtleThief> He does sound like Martin Sheen LUL

[5:21:05] <%Niney_Who> Not V As
[5:21:05] <%Shadowthedigger> It looks really weird on Vergil cause his VA is very not white.
