[0:01:30] <Ugato> haven't seen anything dropped so far. That might have fixed it
[0:01:33] <%thekillerkalamari> Paige doesn't want to spend time with us
[0:01:33] <+Blackgaver> what kind of religion
[0:01:34] <%GohanEgret> she's looking at boots
[0:01:34] <wolf_hurricane> @bleugh there is a pistol in this game with a laser sight
[0:01:34] <TafferAA> she's too good for us, I see

[0:09:33] <%konekoryugamine> cheer100 Hey Pat, I got something funny for ya. A guy next door to my house was ticketed for parking the wrong way, and his car was going to get towed. He REMOVED THE TIRES and put it up on CONCRETE BLOCKS. JUST so it wouldn't get towed. How much more petty can you get, eh?
[0:09:33] <oponomo2> You like shattering heads i see.
[0:09:33] <+boomstickery> devil cry, maybe
[0:09:34] <ShichiNoBushi> The opposite of a necro-clone.
[0:09:36] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> Hey, you know... A Battle Royale Resident Evil wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... would it? cmonBruh cmonBruh
[0:09:36] <birchpeninsula> Hunk is a bio weapon, all natural
[0:09:38] <+verelme> Hunk is the ultimate bio weapon
[0:09:42] <%InfamousShephard> Punished Hunk
[0:09:46] <%ThatGuyfromMars> that zombie is a hardy son of a bitch in my playthrough, everytime I put him down he keeps getting back up
[0:09:47] <%Aerkk> If you could live in any Resident Evil building, which would you pick? Arklay Mansion? RPD? Salazar's Palace?
[0:09:48] <%blubbins> is it the same Chris model they used in RE7?
[0:09:49] <Dehlome> more like a bio-clown
[0:09:50] <CosmicKweeblo> Yeeeeehaw
[0:09:51] <gustavozxd> I kinda want either dante/nero or their guns in this game LUL
[0:09:52] <TheEnablerr> Is Hunk the Ul-ti-mate Bio-weapon?
[0:09:55] <+Zerodyne90> noice
[0:09:58] <allanmiri> pop
[0:09:58] <%DirtyGaijin> @AngriestPat Would you like to see them add RE Outbreak or something similar as a DLC for this game?

[0:10:10] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Aerkk uhhh neither? I dunno if you see the situation those were all in
[0:10:16] <TafferAA> It's not the same Chris model from RE7 because the RE7 model wore a helmet and gas mask
[0:10:16] <%konekoryugamine> The funny thing is, it's TRUE.
[0:10:17] <+Meiou> @TheEnablerr nah thats tofu

[0:11:57] <Abecale> You need a head pop counter on the side when you stream run this game .
[0:11:57] <MrHappyFunshine> @AngriestPat Have you noticed that all the zombies that are eating ass never get up unless you interrupt their ass eating?
[0:11:57] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I wish there were clean versions of the latter costumes
[0:12:00] <%lewdskeletor13> Maybe they’ll remake some Outbreak levels as DLC?
[0:12:06] <reddeadwine1277> @ThatGuyfromMars I appreciate that you have to decide what bodies absolutely have to be dropped, and that you can tailor your decisions based upon what playthrough you're going for.

[0:13:58] <%Dungeon00X> Oh, I guess I get them too in since I got the Deluxe Digital edition.
[0:13:59] <AlasterAngelo> when you're sad and old you memorize a lot of things
[0:14:02] <DominoFrancisco> 2234 baby
[0:14:03] <%fattness132> Make little mnuemonics for them
[0:14:04] <+Taglog7> destiny is destiny
[0:14:06] <%Faustgesicht> did they revert to the best squeaky valve sounds too or nah?
[0:14:07] <TrickeyDickey66> "Once you memorize them, they're memorized"
[0:14:08] <%fattness132> helps memorizing theme easier
[0:14:10] <TrickeyDickey66> nice
[0:14:11] <%Aerkk> Oh wow Pat has mastered Right Left Right
[0:14:11] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Toynota10 Deluxe edition was an extra 20$
[0:14:13] <+Blackgaver> @NWR_James i'm CAD like pat.. soooooo 399?
[0:14:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[0:14:17] <%NWR_James> @Blackgaver DLC is $3.99
[0:14:22] <thelilliestoflivers> Pat, do you think the elza walker costume looks out of place?
[0:14:24] <+Blackgaver> oh LUL
[0:14:24] <LustrousEudemon> he memorized them that's why he asked chat
[0:14:27] <oponomo2> Just sell it to a Vendor 4Head
[0:14:32] <lunardrak3> how do you get that outfit?
[0:14:37] <+Blackgaver> @NWR_James thought it was 399$ ... LUL
[0:14:38] <%connos_livereview> all of the characters in this game are old enough to be my parents
[0:14:40] <TakesGuts> just memorize them 4Head
[0:14:41] <DominoFrancisco> beat the game once
[0:14:45] <%ElenaManetta> Do you like it or loathe it when a game is like, EVEN IF YOU KNOW THE COMBO, YOU NEED TO -PICK IT UP- FOR IT TO WORK road blockers
[0:14:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pop
[0:14:49] <%Toynota10> @ThatGuyfromMars no its $70 on gamestop's site
[0:14:50] <%thekillerkalamari> he isn't getting back up
[0:14:51] <+HoloToast> Dungeon00X the soundtrack is the very last option on the audio options menu, it took me a minute to find it myself
[0:14:51] <%connos_livereview> not by much tho
[0:14:57] <%Raxus_Secundus> Got it memorized?? - Axel, the last 87 Kingdom Hearts games
[0:14:57] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @connos_livereview and they still look like they're in their 30s
[0:14:58] <+Zerodyne90> noice
[0:15:00] <%Laecerelius> But they can't be your parents because they're not allowed to fuck
[0:15:00] <%CerberusDriver> its matt walker again
[0:15:09] <%lewdskeletor13> @elenamanetta I hate it when games do that. Luckily this game doesnt
[0:15:12] <+Blackgaver> yeah guys,, of all the things to memorise.. games are so much easier than homework or some stupid presentation in class
[0:15:13] <+verelme> Kinda sounds like Paige
[0:15:13] <Run44forrest> Fire>
[0:15:15] <+valkuma> you must not be on hardcore, slicing the zombies with the knife on hardcore is awful
[0:15:16] <%NWR_James> @AngriestPat STOP SHOOTING MY DUDE
[0:15:17] <TheEnablerr> Yeah Pat shoot that floor
[0:15:19] <+Nekromatik> The fire looks so wonderful in the remake. Kreygasm
[0:15:20] <oponomo2> why call him names? it's just an undead trying to feed SwiftRage
[0:15:20] <+Yokuho> I'll have you know that my mom is a virgin
[0:15:20] <BigHugs> That revolver takes so long to reload it makes Claire 2nd run so annoying to play
[0:15:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> legaless
[0:15:29] <Ser_Randal> it does and i love it
[0:15:31] <%thekillerkalamari> that is the most quiet fire alarm ever
[0:15:32] <%CerberusDriver> is the revolver better though
[0:15:32] <%lewdskeletor13> LUL
[0:15:32] <exploitativity2> EXILHIRATING
[0:15:33] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Toynota10 holy shit you're right. I thought they were 80$ and I thought I got ripped off when I saw the deluxe edition dlc was like 15$
[0:15:34] <%Aerkk> Is the gun supposed to be a single-action colt? Why is claire fanning the hammer on it
[0:15:36] <%stolando_florida> that revolver needs moon clips
[0:15:39] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat yes, single action revolvers tend to be like that
[0:15:42] <+hkey_local_machine> new york reload
[0:15:45] <TheEnablerr> Claire has never felt a tension like this before
[0:15:46] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Aerkk It is a single action
[0:15:48] <arcaderabbit48> @ElenaManetta Depends on context. If the game just flat out will not let you put the code in, that's bullshit. But if the game jsutifies it by saying you need a code AND you need to go retrieve a key, then I can let it slide.
[0:15:48] <%connos_livereview> @ThatGuyfromMars ty unrealistic media beauty expectations
[0:15:50] <Flyrant> @Aerkk yes
[0:15:51] <+Blackgaver> revolver doesn't seem to be really good...
[0:15:53] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> DMC5 is a month and a week away PogChamp
[0:15:54] <JerryUSA> Where is the nenemis?
[0:15:54] <BigHugs> You can also fan the hammer by holding the shoot button
[0:15:59] <BriniestColt27> pat rick how video game
[0:16:02] <Ser_Randal> no
[0:16:03] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat yes actually
[0:16:03] <%GarbageNirvana> You think Capcom has the same guys come in to do the zombie voices with every game? Because I swear some of those zombies sound like the berserkers from RE4
[0:16:09] <realm_forge> Clare sounds waaaay too much like Paige wen she swears
[0:16:09] <%connos_livereview> its gated so you cant
[0:16:09] <+valkuma> A SAA cant be speedloaded only a single chamber is exposed.
[0:16:11] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat just mash it in there
[0:16:11] <oponomo2> now imagine a real life usual not police girl reloading it in a desperate scenario like this one.
[0:16:15] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat NO you cant use a speed loader for a single action because the cylinder doesnt swing out
[0:16:18] <+boomstickery> depends if its a break frame or not
[0:16:19] <zazzblammymatazz27> A lot of revolvers can't use speed loaders because they have loading gates as opposed to a cylinder that swings out
[0:16:20] <TriadOrion> Certain revolvers of that nature don't have a cylinder that can be flipped out to accept a speed loader
[0:16:21] <%MagickBurritoh> fan it
[0:16:21] <+chaumiester> Not with most SAA. Speedloaders don't work with most Single Action Revolvers
[0:16:22] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> @angriestpat any plans for Metro Exodus?
[0:16:22] <arcaderabbit48> @GarbageNirvana They might recycle zombie moans
[0:16:24] <+Bupkis7> You can't use a speed loader on that kind of revolver
[0:16:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> it looks cool tho
[0:16:26] <+valkuma> in an SAA you also have to manually eject each empty cartridge
[0:16:30] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @connos_livereview forreal, Chris is in his forties in RE7 but he doesn't look it at all.
[0:16:30] <+Blackgaver> wet clair Kreygasm
[0:16:31] <%Aerkk> yeah single action loaders use a loading gate
[0:16:34] <%connos_livereview> youd need like a swing out cylinder mod
[0:16:36] <+Nekromatik> Single-action revolver didn't stop Clint Eastwood from dropping baddies left and right. MiniK
[0:16:38] <zazzblammymatazz27> You can only use something like a speed strip, which is a bitch to use most of the time
[0:16:42] <converterv2> Dont forget to read all the Files Pat. My final missing one for the achievement was the scrap of paper with the medallion zolution
[0:16:43] <Abecale> @AngriestPat You've never felt a tension like this before, reloading during a zombie invasion.
[0:16:48] <+Zerodyne90> there's no such feeling as putting bullet into a well greased chamber
[0:16:49] <exploitativity2> did you hear about the epic store thing
[0:16:50] <+valkuma> @AngriestPat the SAA is what Ocelot uses in MGS3 and its why it takes him so long to reload.
[0:16:51] <%lewdskeletor13> RE protagonists are ageless
[0:16:52] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Finish Last light, it has a strong ending
[0:16:52] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat we're talking 1800s technology here
[0:16:52] <%Fenlig> Did you try 2033 Redux? its such a different game!"
[0:16:56] <DominoFrancisco> I went back and I watched some videos of Claire clips from Degeneration and I'm disappointed that they dont want to bring back Alyson Court because shes great
[0:16:58] <%cerazor01> @AngriestPat Metro Exodus doesn't play like the old Metro games at all.
[0:17:00] <BriniestColt27> Pat, what are you playing this on?
[0:17:00] <conflict1914> you'll need to get the epic games launcher though to play Metro Exodus, its not available on steam anymore
[0:17:00] <%DirtyGaijin> Have we got any confirmation on damage values on head vs chest?
[0:17:04] <lloyddboy> but metro or atomic heart?
[0:17:04] <%connos_livereview> @ThatGuyfromMars i hate chris's look in re7

[0:17:28] <%Toynota10> @AngriestPat How many unfinished games you think you got in your steam library?
[0:17:30] <+BlancoRico> should I play 2033 or the redux version?
[0:17:32] <+HoloToast> Claire just solving puzzles in front of a Licker
[0:17:34] <%konekoryugamine> OH THAT'S A LICKER
[0:17:36] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @connos_livereview I'm fine with it but I don't really care about Chris all that much, I didn't really dig Leon's look in RE6 but we don't talk about that game

[0:18:11] <oponomo2> so in RE5 there's a file that say Lickers are almost perfect. how can a blind, noseless almost deaf creature be perfect?

[0:18:46] <lloyddboy> IN
[0:18:46] <%konekoryugamine> IN
[0:18:47] <%Dungeon00X> Is it easier to get headshots in this game then in original 2?

[0:18:56] <exploitativity2> self righteous suicide
[0:18:57] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @oponomo2 Fast a reproduction and they're not deaf btw. They hear and then they see, like Paige
[0:18:58] <Run44forrest> i feel like lickers With Skin would be WORSE
[0:19:02] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat theres a lot I could teach you about guns and gun terminology
[0:19:02] <lloyddboy> I
[0:19:04] <+jjgamez64> @AngriestPat See if this were a hardcore run it'd be no different, you're playing real good right now. You can do it.
[0:19:04] <%stolando_florida> CRY
[0:19:06] <+Blackgaver> oh wait is that the grenade laucher?
[0:19:10] <%Aerkk> @DominoFrancisco its based on letting the reticle go fully closed and distance to the zombie, different guns have different rates, but yes its a RNG roll
[0:19:10] <exploitativity2> when angels deserve to
[0:19:12] <%Zaramoth> paige a licker?
[0:19:13] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> @reddeadwine1277 just like Wesker

[0:19:16] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@lloyddboy) (warning)
[0:19:16] <TafferAA> the lickers still have a bit of skin on
[0:19:16] <yourliteraldog> To surpass metal gear even
[0:19:18] <+NopeBadguy> does knifing corpses reduce durability
[0:19:19] <%stolando_florida> DIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE
[0:19:19] <+boomstickery> somethign onthe wall
[0:19:24] <gerbera01> wow the original soundtrack is lit
[0:19:24] <that_owl_guy> Lickers are sneaky, have giant claws, and have tongues for days. Truly the pinnacle of evolution Wesker was seeking
[0:19:25] <%Laecerelius> Yes, Claire gets the grenade launcher instead of the shotty
[0:19:25] <+zaworldo> ***
[0:19:29] <%lewdskeletor13> Pat is a well known coward
[0:19:30] <lloyddboy> WAKEUP
[0:19:30] <%konekoryugamine> I am so fucking glad we started just typing this in the chat
[0:19:33] <Flyrant> except all the zombies would take about 14 bullets
[0:19:34] <%FrostMass22> Aren't lickers part of the natural T virus progression?
[0:19:35] <oponomo2> @Sphincter_Spelunker oh, thanks for the info. btw i said almost Deaf... i know they hear, but they are very poor at it LUL
[0:19:35] <%MagickBurritoh> Time to do hardcore then
[0:19:43] <TheEnablerr> where stank leg
[0:19:45] <yourliteraldog> Nano Machines vs T-virus who wins
[0:19:47] <%konekoryugamine> SAVE
[0:19:47] <reddeadwine1277> Wait...what if we're currently holding Wesker's dongle?
[0:19:50] <+Blackgaver> @Laecerelius oh,, i thought it was like a double barrel sawed-off
[0:19:54] <birchpeninsula> Damn, are there no upgrades for the army quickdraw like there weren't for Leon's thug gun?
[0:19:55] <Ser_Randal> @AngriestPat you may as well do hardcore for the gamer cred pat
[0:19:57] <%connos_livereview> no youd be more injured and less inclined to save scum cos ribbons
[0:20:02] <%Raxus_Secundus> Explosion time
[0:20:03] <%ElenaManetta> i ate so fast.... now i feel sick
[0:20:03] <%konekoryugamine> PLease, Wesker HAS NO dongle
[0:20:04] <%CerberusDriver> whats his thug gun
[0:20:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Lickrs are RPD and RFD dudes that got horribly burned
[0:20:05] <%DirtyGaijin> Would nano machines work on a Infected body?
[0:20:07] <gerbera01> HOw do you get the original ost
[0:20:09] <DominoFrancisco> @Aerkk yeah im playing on Claire A Hardcore right now and using the infinite samurai edge, after a bunch of playing around I was starting to wonder if even waiting for the reticle changed anything
[0:20:09] <gerbera01> is it dlc?
[0:20:14] <Run44forrest> Albert Wesker just wants a Quiet Life.
[0:20:15] <Cthulos> are the tile puzzles randomized each game or do they have different solutions per route?
[0:20:16] <megaminimechamocha> More like Residump Pee-vil
[0:20:16] <%ser1ousboardgames> Pats breezing through! So S Rank!!
[0:20:17] <%lewdskeletor13> Yeah
[0:20:18] <+zaworldo> ***
[0:20:18] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Along with infected by t virus
[0:20:18] <+Donut42> Done 2nd run of Leon yet?
[0:20:18] <%BioApple> @yourliteraldog fistfight between armstrong and mr x when
[0:20:19] <AlasterAngelo> @yourliteraldog nano machines in MGS are apparently good enough to cure cancer and turn you into Superman and/or a vampire so probably those
[0:20:20] <arcaderabbit48> Yeah, its not like Lickers have super hearing or echolocation or something to balance out the complete lack of eyes. Also the exposed brain? Probably not great
[0:20:20] <Ion_LaserX> @gerbera01 Yeah
[0:20:25] <reddeadwine1277> You're right. It would have morphed into something much more dangerous.
[0:20:28] <Flyrant> Hardcore has much less inventory space as well
[0:20:31] <%Raxus_Secundus> Hi X
[0:20:33] <%Laecerelius> X gonna give it to ya!
[0:20:37] <LustrousEudemon> @yourliteraldog lickers infected with nano curses
[0:20:38] <gerbera01> Any chance anyone knows how much the original ost is?
[0:20:38] <%MagickBurritoh> X GON GIVE IT TO YA
[0:20:39] <DominoFrancisco> Wesker Samurai Edge seems to crit headshot consistently tho
[0:20:39] <%DirtyGaijin> Almost
[0:20:40] <exploitativity2> *DMX softly begins to play
[0:20:41] <%thekillerkalamari> the lack of skin probably is a design flaw as well
[0:20:46] <%stolando_florida> @gerbera01 $3
[0:20:47] <%Tomiko0> apatJpeg
[0:20:47] <+jjgamez64> @AngriestPat It only felt like bosses took more damage. Zombies still pop just as much and lickers take the same amount of nades.
[0:20:48] <%blubbins> x gon give it to ya
[0:20:48] <%konekoryugamine> Yeah, but it's not like he's gonna just pop out of the wall in about five minute
[0:20:49] <Flyrant> yup
[0:20:53] <+Blackgaver> seems pretty harcore
[0:20:53] <exploitativity2> don't get it twisted
[0:20:54] <EmpressMoth> Did Mr.X appear earlier
[0:20:55] <%Aerkk> @DominoFrancisco It does, but given how maths work if you have infinite bullets you are best just firing as quickly as possible to get as many rolls as possible.
[0:20:56] <%konekoryugamine> Someone failed a spotcheck
[0:20:56] <Ion_LaserX> @gerbera01 $3.99
[0:20:57] <that_owl_guy> The fact their brains can survive being exposed to the enviornment tells you all you need to know
[0:20:58] <DominoFrancisco> WHATCHU HEARIN
[0:20:59] <%MagickBurritoh> SICK JACKET
[0:21:00] <yourliteraldog> @BioApple I want to see the Wrestlemania

[0:21:09] <+jjjkopf> 2 less spots I think?

[0:23:06] <Run44forrest> badge usb sounds like some uber nerd shit
[0:23:10] <arcaderabbit48> Pat is an expert at turning a dongle off
[0:23:17] <$urban_hoof> @angriestpat ... so you havnt memorized it all ?
[0:23:17] <%Aerkk> DMX is NOT in jail right now
[0:23:19] <oponomo2> @XxTippoxX good point. i guess a plot hole
[0:23:19] <+jjgamez64> @AngriestPat Leon B is easiest IMO, shotgun pops all zombos for good, and the magnum and Flamethrower Fry the big guys easy
[0:23:21] <%lewdskeletor13> Nemesis is only after Stars, not X
[0:23:24] <lb_cake> X gon' give it to ya!
[0:23:25] <%Raxus_Secundus> @xxtippoxx she is a survivor and Umbrella don't want none of them
[0:23:25] <RichAnvils> Mr. X sounds like he found paige's boots
[0:23:30] <gustavozxd> is mr x is jail though
[0:23:31] <BigZam> I like how those two dead cops are holding hands in the hallway :')
[0:23:31] <ShichiNoBushi> I'll be the ROOOUUND a bout...
[0:23:31] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> these puzzles feel so much more jarring in this modern graphical fidelity.
[0:23:32] <EmpressMoth> He wants that booty
[0:23:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> s t o m p
[0:23:38] <%Laecerelius> Mr. X likes it rustic

[0:23:51] <%Raxus_Secundus> Crazy talk in 3...2...1.
[0:23:53] <+TONYOO101> mr x everywhere system
[0:23:54] <+Nekromatik> While Claire explores the police station, Jill is still plotting her escape from Raccoon City. monkaS
[0:23:54] <that_owl_guy> The worst part of X is that his foot stomps can totally lie about his location
[0:23:55] <%brackboi> WHOS TAKLING
[0:23:57] <Zacheriah138> glad he's DMX and not Xzibit. "Yo dawg I heard you liked stalkers"
[0:23:58] <%DirtyGaijin> This Claire outfit does seem rustic enough for Paige
[0:23:59] <%konekoryugamine> surprise MOTHERFUCKER
[0:24:06] <reddeadwine1277> He smells that butt sweat
[0:24:06] <oponomo2> Mr. X is just 50 Cent on the T virus.
[0:24:12] <gerbera01> @Nekromatik Jill is like asleep right now
[0:24:13] <+psithen> i can't wait to have remastered nemesis jumping through the RCPD widnows and shit
[0:24:13] <%GohanEgret> @zaworldo there's a reference to a "big umbrella" in the message
[0:24:14] <reddeadwine1277> Clap and Sniff
[0:24:14] <%Fenlig> What happens if you stand under that?
[0:24:16] <MarylandJutsu> HERE COMES THE BOOM
[0:24:17] <%Raxus_Secundus> Hello again x
[0:24:18] <TakesGuts> are acid rounds kinda shit in this one?
[0:24:19] <periwnklepaladin> Claire or Leon, who's better?
[0:24:19] <+redanimator> rage 2 confirmed 60fps on consoles
[0:24:21] <%Zaramoth> that looks pretty bad
[0:24:22] <%DirtyGaijin> MR Shakedown on T-Virus
[0:24:24] <gustavozxd> let's hope pat gets the double mr x bug LUL
[0:24:25] <+XxTippoxX> umbrella wanted survivors, just not anybody in authority. she's literally just looking for chris lol
[0:24:27] <AlasterAngelo> hey guys is DMX in jail
[0:24:29] <+stelfury> if you stand there it doesnt knock the shelf over LUL
[0:24:30] <%lewdskeletor13> @zaworldo He’s in Europe under an “Umbrella” with chicks. Aka investigating Umbrella overseas
[0:24:30] <%MagickBurritoh> uhhh
[0:24:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[0:24:34] <+ProfessorHobbes> If you stand where the bookcase falls, it never falls
[0:24:35] <+Blackgaver> he dead son
[0:24:36] <%CerberusDriver> rip matt walker
[0:24:36] <%blubbins> He's dead Jim.
[0:24:38] <+Alig200> @AngriestPat if you go into the library before the explosion, that shelf wont fall.
[0:24:39] <arcaderabbit48> @gustavozxd Excuse me, what
[0:24:39] <%konekoryugamine> WEll, technically speaking, he's a zombie, so he's already dead
[0:24:40] <%InfamousShephard> Yo pat, you can open the door and have it block the bookcase so it doesnt fall
[0:24:42] <gustavozxd> oh my god pat LUL
[0:24:42] <birchpeninsula> Does Pat have a sound system with speakers around his room, or is he just using TV speakers? From the VODs it seemed like he didn't have positional audio at all
[0:24:44] <%connos_livereview> Plague was playing this erlier and also struggled with the electronic circuit puzzle
[0:24:50] <+Nekromatik> @gerbera01 o_o
[0:24:51] <%Aerkk> @ProfessorHobbes good to know, thanks for the info
[0:24:51] <+boomstickery> those knives are made of wood
[0:24:52] <%connos_livereview> i laff
[0:24:54] <+BizarreRevolver> Does Pat think that there is a new RE timeline?
[0:24:55] <%MettPepp> @AngriestPat You can open that door before the explosion and the bookcase won't block it
[0:25:03] <%MagickBurritoh> uh oh
[0:25:08] <oponomo2> monkaS noises
[0:25:08] <%maskedriderhero> i hear something getting frisky
[0:25:13] <%DirtyGaijin> that gave me a panic attack
[0:25:14] <gustavozxd> @arcaderabbit48 yep, no idea how the guy got it but i found it on yt a couple of minutes before this stream
[0:25:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Somebody needs to mod this game so all the zombies are wearing black suits, the MC is Kiryu and Mr X is Saejima
[0:25:17] <arcaderabbit48> Ram heart burn sounds terrible
[0:25:18] <%sobek399> damn you've trivialized this whole room that gave me so much trouble
[0:25:19] <yourliteraldog> Why is X there is he on a mission or did just get loose because Umbrella failsafes amount to send in an Asian Lady or more bioweapons
[0:25:20] <reddeadwine1277> ruh roh
[0:25:25] <%DirtyGaijin> sounded like it was moving in the frozen time
[0:25:26] <%Raxus_Secundus> Big stomp
[0:25:26] <%connos_livereview> oh lawd
[0:25:27] <birchpeninsula> Imagine if time didn't stop when doing puzzles
[0:25:28] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL

[0:25:43] <%Remery_> She likes the pain

[0:25:46] <+RioGascar> Soooooooo i just now know
[0:25:46] <%Archer2150> !uptime
[0:25:47] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 23m.
[0:25:50] <+RioGascar> To get S+
[0:25:51] <gustavozxd> time doesn't stop, mr x is just a big nice dude :)
[0:25:51] <+XxTippoxX> that's a Falcon Punch if i've ever seen one
[0:25:51] <reddeadwine1277> X keeping his biatch in check
[0:25:52] <RAHRAHRAH> Mr. X is so goddamn cool
[0:26:00] <+RioGascar> Can’t use infinite weapons
[0:26:02] <%maskedriderhero> First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
[0:26:03] <%Aerkk> oooh lawddd he comin'
[0:26:05] <LegendaryDorkKnight> how come no black skin tight shirt on this costume?
[0:26:09] <%Raxus_Secundus> Pat, stop.talking shit to the Tyrant
[0:26:10] <oponomo2> is Tyrant the only Umbrela creation that actualy was stable at receiving orders?
[0:26:12] <RAHRAHRAH> Look at him go, like he's on a mission
[0:26:13] <+RioGascar> So if i wanna get claire A harcore S+
[0:26:14] <ShichiNoBushi> Heck yeah, he doesn't like you calling him names. He wears his heart on his sleeve. Well outside his chest, at least.
[0:26:17] <PROUD2beGINGER> You keep tempting fate by calling people names
[0:26:20] <+RioGascar> i gotta do it legit
[0:26:21] <that_owl_guy> Mr. X is basically part of the cleanup crew. Survivors are gonna talk about this shit, and that is bad for Umbrella @yourliteraldog
[0:26:22] <%ElenaManetta> Look, it's the secret HQ from Unfortunate Events
[0:26:23] <%Kahnicus> What's in the clock tower on 2nd run Claire?
[0:26:24] <%blubbins> Mr. X anywhere system when?
[0:26:26] <arcaderabbit48> @gustavozxd He stares at you while you do the puzzle though. Eyes wide, face all melted, silently. Judging you.
[0:26:29] <%Toynota10> @Remery_ lol yeah the characters moan super loud when they get hurt lol
[0:26:31] <%DirtyGaijin> Is MR X woolies training partner for boxing, the only one who can't stand up to his growing power
[0:26:34] <kiryuuva> nemesis was stable
[0:26:34] <%Laecerelius> No infinite weapons and 3 or less saves
[0:26:34] <%connos_livereview> grenade launcher is so good if i was an re man protag id feel slighted
[0:26:35] <+Nekromatik> If Mr. X is this terrifying to face, I can't even imagine how Nemesis will be. BibleThump
[0:26:39] <kiryuuva> he followed orders
[0:26:40] <arkv01> give it to me Mr. X
[0:26:41] <%MagickBurritoh> Has Pat's stand evolved to empower those he insults?!?!
[0:26:42] <+XxTippoxX> Tyrant wasn't stable, just kind of listened because he wanted to kill
[0:26:44] <brambobelurkin> Reminder that less than an hour ago this same man missed 8 shots on a single zombie
[0:26:45] <EmpressMoth> Has anyone tried the red and blue herb
[0:26:47] <Flyrant> I wanna try going for hardcore S+ but I don't know if I'm ready
[0:26:51] <%maskedriderhero> @oponomo2 There are multiple Tyrants
[0:26:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> mhm
[0:26:57] <gustavozxd> @arcaderabbit48 "damn dude you suck its so easy"
[0:26:59] <periwnklepaladin> The only thing that would make this game better is being able to play as Kiryu, with Mr. X being replaced by Majima
[0:27:00] <EmpressMoth> red + blue combination?
[0:27:00] <yourliteraldog> Bio Evil
[0:27:01] <kiryuuva> maybe the tyrants just needed a hug
[0:27:02] <%Prism_Wing> no
[0:27:05] <Ion_LaserX> Nemesis would be terrifying in this graphics engine running at high speed
[0:27:09] <%DirtyGaijin> Kiryu-san!
[0:27:12] <oponomo2> @maskedriderhero are the multiple tyrants the only stable creation from Umbrela?
[0:27:15] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Designer Kush
[0:27:16] <%maskedriderhero> Umbrella also put restraints on Tyrants too right?
[0:27:16] <kiryuuva> @DirtyGaijin !
[0:27:20] <+swiggityswooty4dabooty> Mr. X, but everytime he steps his feet make the bark noises that DMX makes
[0:27:22] <arcaderabbit48> @gustavozxd "This is the worst its ever been. Killing you would be doing you a favor."
[0:27:25] <count_itachi> Just the stream I wanted to see after running some Bloodborne
[0:27:26] <that_owl_guy> The simple fact Nemesis can wield weapons makes him scarier
[0:27:28] <+Zerodyne90> it always scared me how they had several containers when they dropped Mr X
[0:27:32] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> I just got a S+ on hardcore on Claire A
[0:27:33] <%goose_attack_almanac> Claire makes me feel things
[0:27:34] <+Buzzkill983> I will never tire of the X gonna give it to yah jokes
[0:27:34] <%Aerkk> Looking forward to the knife-frame bug speed runs where runners drop the graphics down to PS1-era qualtiy to get more frames
[0:27:36] <reddeadwine1277> X gonna fist ya
[0:27:36] <%PaladinDupre> GUN FACT: The Samurai Edge is a Beretta 92FS (full size). I used to own a compact version but I gave it to a friend and switched to a 1911 (Leon's 45)
[0:27:37] <+Teldrugar> Is the item and menu select sound default or dlc?
[0:27:38] <%Mogmasta> Time to lay some P I P E
[0:27:42] <Cthulos> Hunters are stable
[0:27:43] <conflict1914> RELOAD
[0:27:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[0:27:46] <%DirtyGaijin> I can't get the image of Majima in a hostess outfit out of my head
[0:27:48] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> its not that Hard
[0:27:51] <Heyestus> extended mag
[0:27:53] <%GohanEgret> restart game
[0:27:57] <count_itachi> Glad you’re running Clair B route tonight @angriestpat
[0:27:59] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> just dont get hit
[0:28:03] <%MagickBurritoh> save
[0:28:04] <%lewdskeletor13> HOW CAN THHIS BE
[0:28:07] <%maskedriderhero> @oponomo2 I think so, but honestly I dunno. Just that the Tyrants are like, their best bio soldiers at this point
[0:28:07] <%Raxus_Secundus> Yes, Nemesis all tentacled and stocked up on weaponry will be terrifying
[0:28:08] <%Laecerelius> no extended mag for SMG?
[0:28:10] <KeiPrime> samurai edge is the coolest a beretta ever looked
[0:28:13] <%stolando_florida> 1911s are obsolete boomer bait guns lmao
[0:28:17] <calvinf10> why does pat have eight samurai edges in his item box
[0:28:22] <kiryuuva> i really want to get the Hunter covenant tattoo from Bloodborne, but idk if i should
[0:28:22] <Heyestus> in yourbox
[0:28:23] <%Ell1ot> Twitch didn't tell me you were playing
[0:28:23] <TafferAA> stars box
[0:28:26] <periwnklepaladin> What are the difference between the A and B scenarios? should i just look online?
[0:28:27] <Heyestus> you got it from the safe
[0:28:29] <arcaderabbit48> A giant human monster chasing you is frightening and all, but I feel like nothing in the world can compare to the raw, visceral feeling of staring down a rocket launcher pointed at you. That the rocket launcher is also being held by a human monster certainly helps.
[0:28:30] <%DirtyGaijin> Deluxe reward @calvinf10
[0:28:30] <kiryuuva> rune as a tattoo*
[0:28:31] <%maskedriderhero> [muffled STARRRRRRS in the distance]

I was doing some fight in an alley, and I THOUGHT I had picked up a knife one of the guys dropped, and mashed out it's heat move. Turns out, I had picked up a [MYSTERIOUS SYRINGE]. The heat move being you pick off the cap on the [MYSTERIOUS SYRINGE], and stab the guy in his asshole, which reignited that fear we both have. On that note, Have Paige play Kiwame, THEN 0.

[0:47:01] <%Typhaeon> Clip = M1 Garand

[0:47:06] <StalwartZephyr> Mausers, etc
[0:47:07] <+Gearcase> Mauser / M1 style

[0:47:09] <graemecrackers1> remember when Hannibal fed Paul his own brain
[0:47:09] <%Blankets_and_Tea> a clip holds the bullets together, the magazine houses the clip
[0:47:10] <%Ninestempest> literally a bunch of bullets held together by a like, hair clip-looking thing
[0:47:10] <+boomstickery> a series of bullets
[0:47:10] <%BBQNINJA1292> A clip is just storage

[0:47:11] <+mgskomododragon> clip is just a dumb made up term
[0:47:11] <exploitativity2> a magazine is an enclosed container or box
[0:47:11] <KashPants3> Clips feed ammo into magazines, magazines feed ammo into the chamber.
[0:47:12] <+Mittensbro> a clip is just a piece of metal that holds ammunition, a magazine actually helps to load the ammunition into the gun
[0:47:13] <+d00msdaydan> a clip is a bunch of bullets on a clip
[0:47:13] <%stolando_florida> @AngriestPat A clip is a strip of bullets made to go into a weapon that has an internal magazine such as a Kar 98 or a M1 Garand

[0:47:14] <+Irridium> a clip is when you can see all the bullets. A magazine has the sides

[0:47:15] <%TheDarkendTruth> clip loads a magazine i think
[0:47:15] <+chaumiester> A clip loads magazines, a Magazine load a gun
[0:47:15] <reddeadwine1277> magazine is for reading da words
[0:47:16] <+Rust_Wick> a clip is nonexistent
[0:47:16] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat clips have open sides. Magazines are fully inclosed
[0:47:16] <Dao_Puppy> An opportunity to get pedantic.
[0:47:17] <%lewdskeletor13> Shut up gun nerds
[0:47:17] <%AncelDeLambert> a clip is internal to the device
[0:47:18] <%Raxus_Secundus> A clip is for older battle rifles
[0:47:18] <%cureneckbeard> A clip is what keeps Sherry's hair in place
[0:47:18] <+Gearcase> Bullets "Clip" onto it. Magazine encases bullets.
[0:47:19] <etoir> a mag is a container
[0:47:19] <%Jjrossman> the little metal thing that holds the bullets together
[0:47:20] <Ekdromoi> Oh boy
[0:47:21] <SubjectX07x> When you insert a stripper clip into the top of a rifle a la the M1 garand's En bloc clip or SKS stripper clips or any bolt action clip.
[0:47:21] <%Rngiddion> a clip is what you use for like a Mauser Rifle from ww2 to put 5 rounds in it
[0:47:22] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@DomunDomunDomun) (warning)
[0:47:22] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat a clip either strips away or pops out (ala M1 Garand ping)

[0:47:36] <+sourceofall> the bullets are clipped onto like a rail thing
[0:47:36] <Gregorhasjoined> clip is a plastic little rail you seat bullets into for easy loading magazines. The M1 garand only takes clips through its port.

[0:47:39] <+UmaButtHole> a clip is for speed loading internal mags
[0:47:39] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> @angriestpat magazine is an external box thing
[0:47:40] <%MagickBurritoh> magazines have clips
[0:47:40] <ObsidianDragon86> It's a bit of a big thing
[0:47:40] <+swiggityswooty4dabooty> A clip is a device that holds bullets that is used to insert them into magazines

[0:47:43] <+starzo0> the difference actually does not matter any more
[0:47:43] <+NopeBadguy> @AngriestPat In RE4, Leon reloads the Handgun with a magazine, but the Red9 with a clip.
[0:47:44] <shevan123> its a pit of metal that holds ammo instead of a full bar
[0:47:45] <%nobunagaesq> 3
[0:47:45] <zazzblammymatazz27> A clip is a device used to load magazines more quickly. Even if it appears a firearm is loaded directly using a clip it's actually feeding the rounds from the clip into a fixed internal magazine on the firearm like the M1 Garand
[0:47:45] <+Rust_Wick> you're made up pat

[0:47:55] <%BBQNINJA1292> M1 used En-bloc clips
[0:47:55] <SubjectX07x> @AngriestPat Clips are meant to load singular rounds faster hence stripper clips for bolt action rifles.
[0:47:56] <%RedMaskBandit> Clips are small arms
[0:47:59] <DominoFrancisco> @AngriestPat a clip is what Leon loads into the Red 9 in RE4
[0:47:59] <randomp141> @AngriestPat A "Clip," holds less than 20 round Magazine holds more, at least that/s what wikipedia told me.

[0:47:59] <oponomo2> alright, good night everyone
[0:48:00] <beercules12> The red 9 uses a clip

[0:48:56] <%rdark_ksu> yea what are the options with this piece
[0:48:57] <SubjectX07x> It's still a clip you are using to load the rounds into the Internal magazine, that is splitting hairs. @ThDark
[0:48:57] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat is smelly
[0:48:57] <%Secutus> A clip isn't enclosed, you can see the bullets
[0:48:58] <ShichiNoBushi> From what I've learned about guns is that a magazine is anything in a gun that holds bullets such as a box magazine or internal magazine.
[0:48:59] <+valkuma> a clip is a bracket that holds bullets and loads it into a chamber in the gun like the M1 Garand or the C96 Broomhandle. The clip is disposable. the Magazine is the detachable bullet chamber for a gun like what you see in handguns.

[0:49:44] <+manwithboxonhead> This GUN debate is getting rather CurseLit
[0:49:44] <%BBQNINJA1292> It has nothing to do with amount, its about mechanics. A clip is just a thing of metal that holds ammo. Magazines have springs that feed ammo into a gun. Guns that have clips still have integral magazines, its a matter of whether or not the magazine is internal to the gun (and then loaded using clips rather than loose ammo) or external in the form of a box magazine

[0:51:02] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat if your looking for an example of something you already said: A speed-loader for a revolver is akin to a clip, where the cylinder would be akin to the magazine. In short, clips load bullets, but are not part of the gun. Magazines contain bullets, and are often part of the gun, but are always part of the guns firing operation.

Don't worry Paige, no matter how much of a fuckup you guys get, we'll love you more! Though not as much as Elmo! I've put a random encounter in my dnd d100 chart where a 40k ork leaks into the game. This is understandably a very bad thing, and will start off the "40k ork invasion" main quest. Failure isn't an option there, as it can spiral into a game over, or TWO; Total World Kill.

[1:10:40] <pth88> ralph pootan
[1:10:42] <%CerberusDriver> he wears weighted training clothes basically, hes Piccolo
[1:10:42] <Run44forrest> Mr X= Broly PogChamp
[1:10:43] <%joylent_blue> i love how calm Claire is during this
[1:10:43] <+SuperDeagle> @alrobot2014 latest patch reintroduces previously fixed bugs and more
[1:10:45] <lionmanguy> I wish clair was ripped
[1:10:45] <%ElenaManetta> you guys are fucking with me

[1:10:46] <mustachemufasa> wait you can move all of them at once?!
[1:10:46] <%DirtyGaijin> Mr X "heh, i'm only using 1 percent of my power"
[1:10:48] <taptapmuhgap> @king_wragles Does the Hat become the Ultimate Bio Weapon O.o
[1:10:50] <%Toynota10> never thought Pat the Almighty would back down from a fighting game
[1:10:50] <%MakotoPB> weighted clothing
[1:10:51] <$KnivesEve> hi all
[1:10:52] <+ahdurian> imagine if Big Chungus could fall through that hole
[1:10:53] <%ElenaManetta> The hat literally limits his fucking power level
[1:10:53] <CalderGaming> the hat isn't but the coat is
[1:10:55] <alrobot2014> @SuperDeagle ah we already got that news
[1:10:58] <ScreamingMeat> When his clothes are removed he mutates uncontrollably
[1:10:59] <%lewdskeletor13> @urban_hoof Yeah he’s the only one
[1:10:59] <%king_wragles> @taptapmuhgap it sure does buddy!
[1:10:59] <ShichiNoBushi> You should be able to lure him to fall through the hole.
[1:11:02] <Worldbrand> But do you see why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch?
[1:11:02] <%connos_livereview> hes wearing weighted clothing
[1:11:04] <Shadicara> Get fuuuucked that is not the lore. He's not wearing weighted clothes
[1:11:05] <calamarvelous> We did it!
[1:11:05] <%DirtyGaijin> Weighted clothing
[1:11:06] <Daxalog> 0
[1:11:07] <$Tuskor13> His sick ass jacket is his training weights so that means he gets to throw off his trenchcoat and his training weights at the SAME TIME
[1:11:08] <RAHRAHRAH> He's so ready, just briskly walking after Claire all like "what are you doing here?"
[1:11:09] <that_owl_guy> 100% correct. Its no coincidence that boss Mr. X is buffed AND shirtless
[1:11:09] <DominoFrancisco> I want to see a Mr X edition Tyrant fight like an el gigante or something and completely fuck it up
[1:11:11] <%connos_livereview> number go up
[1:11:11] <%Raxus_Secundus> I thought the tyrants' limiters were chips implanted in their brains..
[1:11:12] <lloyddboy> BALLS UNEXPOSED
[1:11:14] <%DirtyGaijin> the gear
[1:11:16] <+Maddeax> He's only using 10% of his power Kappa
[1:11:17] <StingtheKing> Don't forget the part this time.
[1:11:19] <taptapmuhgap> @AngriestPat Confirmed, X's Hat is the Ultimate Bio-Weapon
[1:11:20] <+headphonesandhandgrenades> Clocktower
[1:11:20] <%kiiiirsten> Oops I was big napping
[1:11:22] <yourliteraldog> Here me out Mr.X is so hueg his Dick looks small in proportion to the rest of his body
[1:11:23] <Yrefe> are you telling me Mr X rocks weighted clothes piccolo style?
[1:11:23] <TafferAA> pat try to to put the big cog in the small spot
[1:11:27] <%king_wragles> @Tuskor13 Yakuza style right?
[1:11:27] <%jiin6> Mr X's hat is the ultimate Choice for the ultimate life form
[1:11:30] <%DirtyGaijin> noice
[1:11:30] <%ElenaManetta> WHY would they suit their OWN WEAPON with POWER SUPPRESSING CLOTHES
[1:11:36] <%Ell1ot> someone put a napkin over Pat's balls?
[1:11:38] <%Corporate_Redeemer> RESET THE RUN
[1:11:38] <ebonifragaria> Balls concealed!
[1:11:41] <reddeadwine1277> I'd buy that jacket.
[1:11:42] <%lewdskeletor13> BECAUSE
[1:11:42] <%ElenaManetta> We wanted to make a nuke, but we wanted to dial it back so as not to cause too much damage.
[1:11:42] <%CerberusDriver> @ElenaManetta so it doesnt go out of control
[1:11:43] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> Mr X: <picks uo hat> "you are overwncumbered and cannot run"
[1:11:43] <Worldbrand> balls wrapped in bandages
[1:11:44] <$birchpeninsula> Balls Hidden in the Pants
[1:11:44] <BIGGIEsmalls987> Could you bait mr x to fall through the floor in he library?
[1:11:45] <+XxTippoxX> why exactly does he have the hat?
[1:11:46] <%stolando_florida> it would be scary if Mr X had an animation where he threw you on the ground and stepped on you haha he could take his shoes off and step on you with his stinky feet haha that would be really scary haha
[1:11:46] <%connos_livereview> whatever nerd we saw you almost die on normal
[1:11:47] <DominoFrancisco> I love when the old janky evil thing fights the new evil thing and the old janky evil thing is WAY stronger
[1:11:48] <%cureneckbeard> *schlorp*
[1:11:49] <$Tuskor13> Complete global Haturation
[1:11:50] <dekkitout> because mr x's power is too huge
[1:11:50] <%DirtyGaijin> Can we get that hat and put it on Birkin?
[1:11:52] <%urban_hoof> how do i take a look at pats stream schedual
[1:11:52] <brambobelurkin> pat has sufficiently recovered his ball coverage
[1:11:53] <dekkitout> think broly
[1:11:56] <+Yokuho> @AngriestPat Get a soundboard with all RE quotes you love
[1:11:58] <%urban_hoof> !schedual
[1:12:01] <%sobek399> or the the T1000
[1:12:02] <%joylent_blue> they know that a shirtless mr x would be TOO POWERFUL
[1:12:05] <Supabait> Mr X vs Q, who wins? 🤔
[1:12:05] <yourliteraldog> So its literally the clothes
[1:12:08] <arcaderabbit48> @ElenaManetta Also because his heart would be exposed otherwise. Literally its just sitting ther eon his chest. Tyrants are dumb like that
[1:12:08] <%joylent_blue> Kreygasm
[1:12:09] <%ElenaManetta> Haha I made you put on a jacket and now I control you
[1:12:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Because withut it he mutates all over the place. Also he looks like less of a freak
[1:12:13] <%jiin6> Q
[1:12:14] <that_owl_guy> Plus, if they grow too strong they might damage themselves too much while fighting
[1:12:15] <%BioApple> Mr. X is basically an S. Link, you buy him gifts and then he does whatever you want
[1:12:15] <%ser1ousboardgames> Mr X is very supple
[1:12:15] <%lewdskeletor13> Shut up Pat this is not real lore
[1:12:17] <OToole42> hence why mr X's arm goes full tyrant near the end
[1:12:20] <yourliteraldog> But his dong looks small
[1:12:21] <%Raxus_Secundus> Naw, the tyrant's a perfectly controllable, ask Wesker
[1:12:22] <brambobelurkin> Shirtless Mr.X is a walking mass of DMX Clones
[1:12:24] <+Troispoint> Mr. X would definitely be a charge character
[1:12:25] <$Tuskor13> Could a Shirtless Mr X take down Jiren
[1:12:25] <reddeadwine1277> Shirtless X would kill all. No one would be able to stop staring in awe.

[1:12:27] <firearmsinstructor> @AngriestPat A clip is a device used to load a magazine. A clip holds individual rounds of ammunition together, to easily and efficiently load the rounds into a magazine. A magazine encapsulates the ammo entirely inside a "box" where rounds are individually fed into the chamber to be and fired.
[1:12:28] <+Jonesman64> is Mr. X terrified of clockwork or something?
[1:12:28] <dekkitout> anyone can be controlled with the right jacket
[1:12:28] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat When are you gonna dress Elmo up to suppress his power

[1:29:39] <%ElenaManetta> If only there was a closet...
[1:29:43] <+MushyCornbread> ze Fat Evil!!!
[1:29:43] <Fien111> Isn't Sherry supposed to be like 12? Cause she seems about 8 her
[1:29:46] <%Tearonex> Does Irons have a classic costume too?
[1:29:48] <Smart_ZaK1> Maybe when you are angrily chasing a child, you might be the baddie
[1:29:48] <%DirtyGaijin> Try pickpocketing him
[1:29:49] <PROUD2beGINGER> THE LIGHTS IS LOCKED

[1:30:02] <%JJCheeker> Pedo
[1:30:02] <%cureneckbeard> She's small because she's underfed at the terrible orphanage
[1:30:02] <+TheKillerStove> If Irons cant catch a child, how'd he ever make police chief?
[1:30:05] <%connos_livereview> irons is custard brained
[1:30:05] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@firearmsinstructor) (warning)
[1:30:07] <reddeadwine1277> Irons needs to die classic, not dress classic
[1:30:08] <+Tokanova> why is irons like this?
[1:30:08] <%pleasenameyourcharacter> Why is Irons after her? I legit forget.
[1:30:09] <+MonsieurHedge> my cat is here and he meows "STAAARS"
[1:30:09] <that_owl_guy> The fact Iron's search pattern is always the same really sucks the tension out of this, lol
[1:30:16] <%poweredscoot> Suplex him Sherry
[1:30:17] <%NovaKnightmare> Whats better, this asshole irons or hammy irons
[1:30:18] <%Prism_Wing> Snap his neck SwiftRage

[1:32:26] <Splatterfest> His ass
[1:32:26] <+lethallunacyx> water to acid makes big spal
[1:32:27] <%Aerkk> Stalking Killers can access the axe-dimension
[1:32:28] <%Fenlig> Irons has a fully upgraded inventory
[1:32:30] <%connos_livereview> its in his inventory
[1:32:31] <%Zaxshimysham> Pat is Sherry's spirit animal confirmed
[1:32:32] <%commanderclaw> Knock Knock
[1:32:32] <+BorinCorran> @that_owl_guy His folds. That's the benefit of the Fat evil.

[1:32:46] <%tyler274> add water to acid and it get real hot real fast
[1:32:47] <reddeadwine1277> He had it inside of the corpse on the table
[1:32:47] <KangarooCyborg> Downpour axe. It is everywhere and nowhere
[1:32:48] <Ion_LaserX> a pocket dimension
[1:32:50] <$birchpeninsula> The reason for acid to water instead of water to acid is to not have acid splash everywhere
[1:32:52] <%Shady_Zaku> It crash landed from Downpour
[1:32:55] <%commanderclaw> Imagine resident evil with stands
[1:32:57] <%DirtyGaijin> the axe dimension

[1:36:49] <%Dingus_Tickler> Hey, I’m extremely late bc I’ve been playing the game. Did you know about zig-zagging vs dogs to avoid damage?
[1:36:53] <Smart_ZaK1> He was waiting to get shot

[1:37:11] <%DirtyGaijin> @AngriestPat have you ever considered a career at PETA
[1:37:13] <THESamGlover> @cerazor01 In the novelization of Resident Evil 2, “City of the Dead,” it’s revealed that Mr. X was able to track Claire and Sherry because Sherry’s necklace was somehow also a homing device of some sort. It’s super dumb.
[1:37:13] <allanmiri> pop
[1:37:15] <TafferAA> that giraffe is tgerrifying

[1:38:15] <CrabSlacks> orphans love SMG's
[1:38:19] <Sinister_Aglet> probably left it when they disposed of the kids
[1:38:22] <jacknerik> This place reminds me of the baker estate
[1:38:22] <+Tacowavable> All good orphanages keep their bathroom stocked with SMG ammunition
[1:38:22] <%ElenaManetta> He also couldn't see Sherry two inches frmo his fucking face.
[1:38:23] <C_S_N_G> Cuz he dumb

[1:38:25] <%jiin6> Irons an idiot
[1:38:25] <Ion_LaserX> You never know when these orphans are packin heat
[1:38:26] <%sobek399> first aid sprays and herbs only work on player characters
[1:38:26] <%stolando_florida> First Aid Sprays don't work on acid thrown by orphans obviously
[1:38:27] <elrey745> Irons was min maxing
[1:38:27] <Estuko> He didn't have it equipped
[1:38:28] <$Chatterbox1991> hey if it aint broke dont fix it!

[1:38:37] <CrimsonFox777> He was saving it for later, like a JRPG fan. Kappa
[1:38:37] <Shadicara> Other people don't heal instsntly from herbs
[1:38:38] <%connos_livereview> @stolando_florida never got that far in diablo cos it put me to sleep sry

[1:39:46] <+TheKillerStove> Its a shame cause RE 6 is trash
[1:39:47] <%Toynota10> And she wears a skimpy sailor outfit
[1:39:48] <%DirtyGaijin> You only need to be faster than the child pat

[1:40:34] <%DirtyGaijin> G-DaDDY
[1:40:34] <%Jetsfantasy> Man, that pimple just grows on his neck, doesn't it?
[1:40:36] <FruitBasketVidya> i am interested to see what claire gives shelly when she is looking for the cure in this costume
[1:40:37] <+lethallunacyx> she said, I'm your Daddy
[1:40:37] <%connos_livereview> @ElenaManetta LUL
[1:40:38] <ShichiNoBushi> THERE she recognized him as her dad.
[1:40:40] <PROUD2beGINGER> Daddy no
[1:40:41] <+Eddy21forsaken> how does MR. X reappear in Leon's story, HE GOT GOT?
[1:40:42] <%ThatGuyfromMars> yoo paige getting spoiled on RE lore
[1:40:42] <%AirlineFood74> @Ran196 he never used it
[1:40:43] <+Blackgaver> this family isin't ok
[1:40:44] <$Big_King_Coconut> X has had worse
[1:40:44] <%GarbageNirvana> So he...doesn't get blown up by a rocket launcher?
[1:40:44] <kiryuuva> Anette is worse than William imo
[1:40:46] <+Jonesman64> its a birken family
[1:40:46] <+cyanide_xz> leon noir skin is dope af when he hold the gun sideways
[1:40:48] <%Blankets_and_Tea> family family family
[1:40:48] <waifoong98> "Birkin Bad" Kappa
[1:40:50] <%Shady_Zaku> MR EX
[1:40:52] <+DeaconBluesClues> Does that cutscenr imply multiple tyrants in the ploice station
[1:40:53] <gustavozxd> RANDY NO *SPLORGE*
[1:40:54] <that_owl_guy> They even run a cooking show called Jerkin with Birkin
[1:40:59] <BigZam> Man, that weird nightmare monster looks just like my dad Kappa
[1:41:05] <%UltraCasualBoom> Infinite Knife Ammo
[1:41:06] <dekkitout> tajWUT what sorcery?
[1:41:06] <%ThatOneGameTester> apatHoldon
[1:41:07] <%DirtyGaijin> I thought he used it in the RPD
[1:41:09] <%CerberusDriver> Mr.X got X'd out
[1:41:11] <%lewdskeletor13> Leon looks like Sebastian from Evil Within with that Noir outfit
[1:41:13] <Ion_LaserX> Randy No Not the USB Dongle
[1:41:17] <%sobek399> i thought it got stuck in a zombo
[1:41:19] <+photas10> how do you get the infinite knife ?
[1:41:20] <%Plague_Nurse> Jerkin with Birkin sounds like a porno
[1:41:20] <Quikanims> How many Mr. X's are there in RE2 canonically?
[1:41:20] <kiryuuva> @AngriestPat who's worse, Annette or William?
[1:41:20] <%AirlineFood74> It took it out then reloaded the save
[1:41:23] <%maskedriderhero> I guess X got it brought to him
[1:41:24] <MegaFangKing23> Infinite Knife PogChamp
[1:41:26] <MrHappyFunshine> @AngriestPat Sherry actually has a burst fire pistol in RE6 but unfortunately it ain't Mathilda
[1:41:26] <THESamGlover> @eddy21forsaken There are multiple Mr. X’s, at least originally.
[1:41:28] <%MelBrooksKA> The initials of their family spell WAS... or SAW
[1:41:28] <%AirlineFood74> he used a regular knife
[1:41:35] <%Dingus_Tickler> Infinite Knife in this game is the most underwhelming reward tbh
[1:41:36] <+Blackgaver> kill them all
[1:41:37] <%Kahnicus> @DeaconBluesClues I believe that there are in fact multiple Tyrants.
[1:41:40] <PaPaSeppuku> X will not give it to us
[1:41:40] <Ran196> my bad, thought pat used it
[1:41:44] <%CerberusDriver> In the original, there's like a helicoptor that drops Tyrants in pods into the city
[1:41:44] <%ThePuddingDead> Annette is the worst
[1:41:45] <%AirlineFood74> william
[1:41:50] <%ElenaManetta> As far as I'm concerned, Will is already dead.
[1:41:52] <%DirtyGaijin> @AngriestPat Does the knife work as an Infinite source of knives?
[1:41:52] <Ser_Randal> William
[1:41:52] <+TheKillerStove> Doesnt saving this much lower your end rank?
[1:41:52] <%connos_livereview> Umbrella left the t virus files at raccon city medieval times
[1:41:53] <Desertfishing> billiam
[1:41:53] <%lewdskeletor13> William for sire
[1:41:55] <%NWR_James> Mr X : Gonna give
[1:41:55] <ScreamingMeat> But Berkin MAKES it happen
[1:41:56] <FackinCrazy> William is a monster most of the time
[1:41:58] <grayjammer> Everything Is Under Control
[1:41:59] <+Blackgaver> smell like poopoo
[1:42:00] <%maskedriderhero> There are multiple Tyrants, Umbrella drops a bunch to clean out Raccoon City
[1:42:02] <$Big_King_Coconut> ha ha poop joke
[1:42:03] <%NovaKnightmare> William is BFFs with fucking WESKER thats pretty evil by association
[1:42:03] <%ElenaManetta> It doesn't matter if he's aware, he may as well be dead.
[1:42:04] <%lewdskeletor13> William is a huge prick
[1:42:04] <yourliteraldog> Why did they have a kid
[1:42:05] <%Dingus_Tickler> Even the infinite Samurai Edge isn’t the crazy OP weapon you’d expect it to be
[1:42:05] <MegaFangKing23> Annette is worst mom. SMOrc
[1:42:07] <%maskedriderhero> Nemesis being one of them I think
[1:42:08] <%Plague_Nurse> @quikanims leon/claire get chased by one the 1, but cannically there's 4
[1:42:08] <+jjjkopf> they drop 8 tyrants
[1:42:11] <%Laecerelius> doo-doo time!
[1:42:11] <%cureneckbeard> Literally!
[1:42:13] <%AirlineFood74> Suffer like G did
[1:42:14] <Fien111> William developed a virus that makes incest-seeking blob monsters, though
[1:42:16] <+photas10> does infinite knife effect s+ rank
[1:42:16] <that_owl_guy> Annette lets everything happen, but William made G to begin with so he is the worst
[1:42:20] <+Eddy21forsaken> @THESamGlover okay got it
[1:42:20] <%Kahnicus> Again, Claire's gonna have one hell of a kidney infection.
[1:42:20] <%UltraCasualBoom> Claire: I’m gonna smell like a Smash player
[1:42:21] <waifoong98> Loen Birkin is the worst Kappa
[1:42:22] <%ThePuddingDead> they're both seriously up there with incompetent evil characters
[1:42:24] <Ser_Randal> SUFFER LIKE G DID
[1:42:24] <%stolando_florida> Imagine all that poo soup getting into Claire's snatch rn
[1:42:24] <+Blackgaver> now claire has a stank butt
[1:42:25] <%ElenaManetta> So going through sewer levels in shorts must be fucking horrible.
[1:42:27] <Caidezes> Annette is an asshole.
[1:42:30] <+Alig200> @Dingus_Tickler yeah, it isnt OP, the infinite LE-5 on the other hand...
[1:42:32] <Desertfishing> who flushed the toilet
[1:42:33] <MasterKoosh> supposedly you lose the knife permanently if you let a body disappear after using it to counter
[1:42:34] <%sobek399> G vitamins
[1:42:35] <%cureneckbeard> Really the most lethal thing in this game is the bacteria in the sewer
[1:42:35] <%PaladinDupre> A HIND D?!
[1:42:37] <%ThePuddingDead> "We didn't know this would happen!" BITCH
[1:42:37] <%DirtyGaijin> I do think they made Annette more redeemable in this one during Claires playthrough
[1:42:39] <forlorncarton> Man the house of the dead 2 was great
[1:42:41] <%connos_livereview> infinite sammy edge is lame and boring to use
[1:42:41] <+DeaconBluesClues> Never a good day for swampass
[1:42:43] <reddeadwine1277> Both are the shittiest parents around these parts.
[1:42:45] <+BorinCorran> I still want to know what umbrella board meetings looks like, who approves all the leather dusters for 6 8 foot tall monsters?
[1:42:46] <beercules12> Dont forget william and wesker having the lamest saturday night known too man
[1:42:47] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> DEAD
[1:42:48] <HeadsHeldHigh> Sewer socks
[1:42:49] <germanmafia23> fucked it up
[1:42:49] <dekkitout> guys, guys, guys- theyre both shite people
[1:42:50] <Splatterfest> You cannot get S+ if you use an unlimited weapon of any kind
[1:42:52] <Desertfishing> you fucked up
[1:42:53] <%BioApple> William's a piece of shit even pre-G, he's basically irons with a phD according to the files
[1:42:54] <%Mr_Turley> SUH
[1:42:55] <Madbearv> pat go up
[1:42:57] <%ThePuddingDead> holy shit...is he ok!?
[1:43:00] <%nmaten> suh dude
[1:43:00] <+jjjkopf> CRAZY TALK
[1:43:01] <Quikanims> @plague_nurse so he just healed from Birkin's assault?
[1:43:04] <%joylent_blue> Claire took that frag to the face like a champ
[1:43:06] <Fien111> Annette fucked Sherry's life, William fucked over RACCOON CITY
[1:43:08] <ChiefSombrero> There's at least a minimum of Two Mr.X's, the RE2 one and the cameo RE3 one
[1:43:11] <%ElenaManetta> I have never been in sewers before but every video game has like... Offices in them. Are those.... real.
[1:43:21] <ebonifragaria> See ya forever?
[1:43:21] <%crimsonharvest> did anyone else see Pat just flawlessly stomp a 2 zombie ambush
[1:43:25] <%Dingus_Tickler> @alig200 Do you get the Infinite Rocket Launcher / Mini-Gun at the start of the game? Or obtain it like you originally did?
[1:43:26] <%NWR_James> sometimes I hear Claire interject and I think Paige is scolding Pat
[1:43:27] <+Spireman> Yep
[1:43:27] <TheHeroAppears> see ya forever later fuckers
[1:43:28] <%ThePuddingDead> I actually missed the last half of Claire's story
[1:43:31] <TafferAA> dumped the empties fro mthe gun twice
[1:43:33] <grayjammer> See You At Forever Later
[1:43:34] <Smart_ZaK1> see you forever!

[1:43:36] <fighterman> synth choir
[1:43:37] <Firesparks> @Fien111 but it was hunk's team that fucked over the city
[1:43:37] <+Spireman> I work in one
[1:43:38] <person181> keep watching
[1:43:39] <jacknerik> @ElenaManetta The offices in this game are because it's a secret base
[1:43:39] <%DirtyGaijin> I like claires story over leons
[1:43:42] <%Stratiotai2> I cant imagine the diseases
[1:43:44] <+Blackgaver> her running animation is a lil weird
[1:43:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[1:43:50] <+TheKillerStove> @ChiefSombrero Arent there 6? The RPD one and the 5 sent to stop the military response?
[1:43:52] <ebonifragaria> LUL
[1:43:54] <Huntercd> !uptime
[1:43:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 43m.
[1:43:56] <LegendaryDorkKnight> her face is a little wierd
[1:43:58] <FackinCrazy> @AngriestPat Infinite knife does not affect rank only the guns
[1:43:59] <%Kahnicus> @ElenaManetta There's got to be some space people can get into in order to perform maintenance work, offices might be overmuch.
[1:44:00] <Huntercd> Damn it
[1:44:03] <$spacehouse> smell ya later forever
[1:44:04] <that_owl_guy> Next question; how many times will Pat get poisoned?
[1:44:05] <%stolando_florida> @Spireman Are the G-Creatures good boys?
[1:44:10] <+Alig200> @Dingus_Tickler they appear just like the infinite weapons after getting the S+'s for Leon/Claire on Hardcore.
[1:44:13] <+EmotionalFatGuy> just wait 2 more minutes for another stupid phrase
[1:44:23] <%DirtyGaijin> more things like plant rooms and machinery
[1:44:24] <%Stratiotai2> like could you imagine wading around in sewage above waist height? there is no way your dick doesnt fall off and you dont get aids
[1:44:27] <%ThePuddingDead> i think they're orphans....
[1:44:31] <Cthulos> Thanks for shooting Birkin, Martinez. You started this, you piece of shit
[1:44:32] <+Blackgaver> there bad bois..

[1:44:47] <%lewdskeletor13> Stupid Martinez PunOko
[1:44:48] <%valriot> the G stands for Gud
[1:44:49] <DaveStrider55> the G creatures are Sherry's sublings
[1:44:50] <%ThePuddingDead> its hard to convince me their not just dumped orphans in the sewer and had time to mutate
[1:44:50] <%JJCheeker> Max had a fun time with G creatures
[1:44:54] <%DirtyGaijin> The ivys are fucking fantastic in this game
[1:45:01] <%ElenaManetta> Man ,this whole game could've been avoided with cell phones!
[1:45:05] <%connos_livereview> j martinez true hero of umbrella
[1:45:06] <%Dingus_Tickler> @alig200 Then those guns would change the game like you expect. Unfortunately the Infinite Knife and Samurai Edge are absolutely ignorable.
[1:45:07] <%joylent_blue> thanks for the note Leon you fuck
[1:45:09] <Splatterfest> Weird I looked it up and yeah unlimited knife is good for S+
[1:45:12] <+Spireman> Dead ass
[1:45:13] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat I missed most of Leon B, did Claire leave him notes too?
[1:45:15] <+DeaconBluesClues> Ivys in this freak me out
[1:45:15] <+BorinCorran> @Stratiotai2 Worse yet, imagine doing it in cut-offs. Claire has no protection for her thighs.
[1:45:15] <+timblenaut> wow look at those GAMS
[1:45:16] <Smart_ZaK1> See you forever, Leon
[1:45:17] <jacknerik> Is getting out of the police station the half way point?

[1:49:23] <%Raxus_Secundus> Does Pat like parties outside of RPGs?

[2:05:09] <THESamGlover> Boomer’s a mindset more so than an age, Pat.
[2:05:12] <%lewdskeletor13> That’s dumb
[2:05:18] <nerdblase> It encourages clean menu tech.

[2:05:48] <dekkitout> in the before times
[2:05:50] <firearmsinstructor> Helpful for that achievement.
[2:05:53] <%jiin6> Pat, that time you yelled at kids to get off the lawn makes you a boomer by default
[2:05:56] <$spacehouse> and we LIKED IT
[2:06:03] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat I had to walk to school, uphill, BOTH WAYS
[2:06:04] <+PenmanLupine> back in the good old days when QoL didn't exist

[2:06:51] <CopperTucker> in my day our resident evils had terrible voice acting and we loved it
[2:06:52] <that_owl_guy> Remember when everything was cheaper and we didn't go into debt just from going to the hospital or college? You damn kids have it so good and you don't even know. t101Shigeru

[2:08:56] <Desertfishing> Elmo needs a wireless lapel mic
[2:08:57] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Elmo has the biggest number
[2:08:58] <%lewdskeletor13> KEEP PRAYING CHAT
[2:08:59] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> He is the STRONG
[2:08:59] <Dakuu75> I think what blew my mind the most watching Max's stream: was seeing him move all the book-shelves at the same time int he library lol
[2:08:59] <%thishere2103> pray harder
[2:09:00] <+Tokanova> elmo could beat shaggy at 2000%
[2:09:01] <that_owl_guy> But we already started making offerings for Elmo!

[2:09:06] <Splatterfest> @swiggityswooty4dabooty what have they been doing on the ps4 and xbone? I still have an empty game shelf for those consoles
[2:09:07] <%ElenaManetta> apatJpeg vs apatBlep
[2:09:09] <$birchpeninsula> What if Elmo is in pain and that's why he screams? He might need to shed this weaker skin soon!
[2:09:09] <%Raxus_Secundus> @swiggityswooty4dabooty It's been 5 ish years so that seems about right
[2:09:10] <%cureneckbeard> beep beep
[2:09:11] <OwlLightningMage> Shaggy petted Elmo once and this was the result

[2:09:20] <FackinCrazy> Why does elmo have a giant eye on his weird bag
[2:09:24] <CrabSlacks> his screams will peel away all known layers of reality! EMLO
[2:09:24] <%tweedler92> Geandpa needs to charge his spirit bomb
[2:09:35] <thelilliestoflivers> how old is emlo?
[2:09:36] <$swiggityswooty4dabooty> Playstation life cycles have been about 6-7 years per console so I guess it makes sense
[2:09:39] <brambobelurkin> GOOOEY
[2:09:41] <%connos_livereview> god i hate the goo room
[2:09:44] <$swiggityswooty4dabooty> Its just hard to believe its been 6 years since PS4
[2:09:46] <beercules12> leave jiren to elmo
[2:09:50] <%DirtyGaijin> Elmo's scream bends time and space
[2:09:51] <%Remery_> all that gamer goo
[2:09:51] <Trillex56> big goo
[2:09:52] <deadredeyez> ruuun
[2:09:53] <Dakuu75> My sister got a new kitten. Little shit is teething. he bites anytime we try to pick him up or pet him atm XD
[2:09:53] <%lewdskeletor13> The goo room is the hardest part of the game
[2:09:54] <%JJCheeker> Elmo gets his strength from eating hair
[2:10:00] <Trillex56> biggest goo
[2:10:02] <%CerberusDriver> id honestly prefer the original G over these assholes, I hate them
[2:10:03] <%DirtyGaijin> Ready for GOO
[2:10:03] <$birchpeninsula> I can't wait for Pat to leave his knife in the goo hallway again
[2:10:04] <%jiin6> what the fuck indeed
[2:10:04] <%Aerkk> What the fuck?! is a good response to seeing a G creature
[2:10:07] <CrabSlacks> ooey gooey
[2:10:10] <%ThePuddingDead> he's a self sustaining economy
[2:10:12] <DracaenaLeaf> "The fuck"

[2:10:14] <%joylent_blue> THE FUCK
[2:10:15] <santystuffs> Even if PS5 becomes a thing soon, i can see many crossgeneration titles for at least 2 years
[2:10:15] <Trillex56> get gooed on pat
[2:10:17] <%Aerkk> really heavy voice acting emphasis on the FUCK part too
[2:10:18] <that_owl_guy> Ok, how many times will Pat get poisoned? Taking all bets!
[2:10:19] <%king_wragles> That's right, Elmo IS a self-voring Sampson
[2:10:21] <LegendaryDorkKnight> boop

[2:10:34] <Dakuu75> @Kahnicus lol oh we DO, we do~
[2:10:36] <%Raxus_Secundus> @that_owl_guy many times
[2:10:38] <%DirtyGaijin> @Aerkk Id say its the appropriate response
[2:10:39] <%BioApple> worst part of goo room is figuring out how much ammo to take with you since there's so much crap to pick up in the storage room but also so many monsters to shoot
[2:10:40] <$swiggityswooty4dabooty> Its likely that TLoU 2 will be on PS5 then
[2:10:44] <person181> he is now
[2:10:46] <Ion_LaserX> @that_owl_guy 3 times
[2:10:49] <+x24sonic> cut his legs off!!

[2:12:02] <%DarthFreeman> @AngriestPat You can't actually shoot through the glass or gaps in the doors.
[2:12:03] <JonKhan> Is the reloading exhilarating?
[2:12:08] <%connos_livereview> damn brutal

[2:13:04] <%DarthFreeman> @AngriestPat Also, the codes for the Laboratory are 3123(drug test), and 2067(dispencer)
[2:13:06] <+lethallunacyx> you can shoot thru windows though
[2:13:08] <%Luna_Ashford> It bugs me so much she doesn't aim down the fucking sights, fuck fanning the hammer.

[2:13:33] <%lewdskeletor13> apatSmug apatSmug apatSmug
[2:13:37] <%cureneckbeard> fed up with these fake shooter girls
[2:13:40] <$birchpeninsula> So I saw some talk about Licker assholes and dog dicks in the last stream, are those confirmed in the game?
[2:13:41] <Splatterfest> @Luna_Ashford I loled when Leon gangster aimed the 1911
[2:13:41] <that_owl_guy> Kittens understand it. They bite a parent too hard sometimes and that yell gets the point across
[2:13:43] <+Meiou> @DirtyGaijin i know right! dude was jus trying to ask pat how to get out and he shot him
[2:13:45] <Jack8274> @Luna_Ashford The real pros don't need to aim down sights
[2:13:52] <Ran196> if you shoot them in the neck will their head falls off? like how their body will split apart if you shoot them in the stomach with the shotgun?
[2:13:57] <%Kahnicus> @Dakuu75 The cat I had when I was a kid was a kitten when I was a human larva so I don't really remember kitten things.
[2:14:02] <+lethallunacyx> @jjcheeker yeah, I saw that earlier!
[2:14:04] <%cureneckbeard> I bet Claire doesn't even know the difference between a clip and a clipazine
[2:14:05] <Lurantis_> I get that it’s a video game but I still hate Claire’s outfit

[2:18:12] <%jiin6> Hydrate your balls
[2:18:14] <$swiggityswooty4dabooty> Honestly, you drinkin diet coke and layin off Red Bull. Diet coke cant be any worse for you than sugar free red bull
[2:18:14] <LegendaryDorkKnight> man f red bull they're dicks anyway
[2:18:15] <%FracturedImage> SHILL TO THE MAX
[2:18:17] <%ElenaManetta> $80 worth of juice i'll send to your house for you to keep living, Pat

[2:18:24] <EdibleNewb> if you are 30 something red bulls can't be good
[2:18:25] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat why not just alternate? for every red bull you drink , drink two bottles of water
[2:18:31] <%joylent_blue> PogChamp
[2:18:38] <brambobelurkin> what are these enemy types called?
[2:18:38] <firearmsinstructor> This one weird trick to fool your sponsors... Fill empty red bull cans with hard liquor.
[2:18:40] <Cthulos> if it's diet coke, you're better off drinking regular coke. Aspartame is bad shit
[2:18:44] <AlasterAngelo> or better yet just stop drinking Red Bull
[2:18:44] <Splatterfest> @that_owl_guy confirmed pat is magic
[2:18:48] <%joylent_blue> brambobelurkin fucking gross
[2:18:49] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Is Pat actually dying? What's going on with his body? What's happening?
[2:18:50] <+lethallunacyx> one more red bull and pat will achieve witch time
[2:18:50] <Dakuu75> @brambobelurkin adult-G
[2:18:50] <that_owl_guy> Pat probably needs to do two or three weeks of only water, honestly
[2:18:51] <%DirtyGaijin> Don't die Pat, i need someone to get me into obscure shit
[2:18:51] <%stolando_florida> @Yokuho I'd drink that nasty recycled sewage water they use for cooking oil in China for the right price
[2:18:52] <%ElenaManetta> Pat can't die. I can't have my virtual friends leave, too!
[2:18:58] <%Kahnicus> Before I realized G Adults were regular enemies I thought I had the easiest William boss fight ever.
[2:18:59] <$birchpeninsula> @42nfl19 pat would drown Kappa

[2:19:02] <OwlLightningMage> Claire and Leon had a baby and its name was Shaggy LUL
[2:19:05] <RetributionP> it sounds more like people freaking out about your health so they can feel good about them selfs being armchair doctors
[2:19:07] <%Aerkk> Pat can't drink a lot of water as a streamer, b/c water + caffeine = repeated bathroom breaks, he has to master the 1 skill of being able to sit in a given location for several hours
[2:19:14] <%Rockgagong> Who said that?
[2:19:15] <%IronPickle> is it cold in Quebec today?
[2:19:17] <+BorinCorran> Can never have too much acid.

[2:19:49] <%CerberusDriver> what are acid rounds for
[2:19:51] <%cureneckbeard> If Pat dies, Paige is promoted to Pat and Elmo is promoted to Paige. Skelmo is promoted to The Baby
[2:19:52] <AlasterAngelo> @DirtyGaijin yeah with her hand up his butt to make him talk
[2:19:57] <%connos_livereview> what
[2:19:59] <%stolando_florida> La Croix tastes like what a memory of a flavor tastes like
[2:20:02] <RetributionP> besides redbull tastes like shit. monster is better
[2:20:03] <%Kahnicus> @DirtyGaijin Like a lever and pulley system?
[2:20:04] <+Reizie_Etherealm> If Pat dies before I do then I'm joining him right after I mourn for him a little
[2:20:07] <%Dungeon00X> Maybe if you followed Red Bull and asked them for an extra huge can of it?
[2:20:09] <%LogothX> It's REALLY powerful
[2:20:11] <Huntercd> @Aerkk He could always wear a diaper
[2:20:11] <%valriot> Cos you can just melt zombies legs off and theyre free
[2:20:11] <%ElenaManetta> HE SAID IT
[2:20:12] <%LogothX> Better take it with you
[2:20:13] <%jiin6> For Killing
[2:20:13] <$saturnianocean> Terrible demons
[2:20:13] <%Corporate_Redeemer> CAN OF FIZZ
[2:20:16] <+ahdurian> but they're zombies
[2:20:19] <%Rockgagong> Aw yeah butt stuff
[2:20:21] <Firesparks> is there actually living thing in this game?
[2:20:21] <%lewdskeletor13> I clapped
[2:20:22] <%DirtyGaijin> Barry GO home
[2:20:23] <Ion_LaserX> Look At This
[2:20:24] <Jack8274> Are zombies living things?
[2:20:25] <LegendaryDorkKnight> guys dont kys
[2:20:26] <jacknerik> everything here is undead tho
[2:20:26] <%connos_livereview> TAKE A LOOKAT THIS
[2:20:28] <person181> but they aren't living
[2:20:29] <that_owl_guy> I'd rather Pat's corpse be turned into a mechanized puppet for Elmo to pilot.
[2:20:29] <+NiktenKing> Who even developed acid rounds?
[2:20:30] <%DirtyGaijin> I CLAPPED
[2:20:33] <nerdblase> I feel as though Red Bull can be cut with something to make a half decent swamp water.
[2:20:36] <%Voidwyvern> I clapped when he said the thing
[2:20:36] <%ElenaManetta> Jill Master of Sandwiches!
[2:20:36] <$birchpeninsula> @cureneckbeard does Steve Buscelmo become the new Skelmo?
[2:20:36] <+Troispoint> If Pat prestiges, he gets to start over as Paige
[2:20:40] <%IronPickle> marshaling area DLC to come out this summer
[2:20:40] <+BorinCorran> Here's a lockpick. It might come in handy if you, THE MASTER OF UNLOCKING take it with you.
[2:20:42] <awalr> i recognize that sequence of words
[2:20:44] <%valriot> Okay, but actually theyre for stunning Lickers and melting zombies limbs off
[2:20:45] <shurtal> We clapped when he said the thing!
[2:20:50] <%Aerkk> @Huntercd thats what NASA astronauts do, surely Pat would want to be COOL like and ASTRONAUT
[2:20:52] <Naho_Saenoki> @Jack8274 No.
[2:20:55] <OwlLightningMage> But who is the master of unlocking if our eyes aren't real?
[2:20:56] <PessimisticOptimism> What about un-unliving things
[2:21:00] <%lewdskeletor13> THAT PATTERN OF WORDS makes sense to me
[2:21:00] <$swiggityswooty4dabooty> Claire McCree
[2:21:00] <SchroedingersFerret> I hope this isn'
[2:21:01] <%stolando_florida> He's a cop, the RPD is his home Pat
[2:21:03] <%Raxus_Secundus> But Pat, since you are now sponsored by Red Bull, shouldn't you have like a case per stream for promotional purposes... juat kidding, please don't do that
[2:21:03] <%Kahnicus> Hope this is not CHRIS'S blood....
[2:21:04] <%MagickBurritoh> fan it
[2:21:06] <Firesparks> in re1, the hunter are actually still living, but pretty sure everything in this game are zombie
[2:21:08] <%connos_livereview> yeah your better off not coming back straight up
[2:21:09] <%cureneckbeard> Yes. And chat is promoted to the new Steve Buscelmo. his photo is replaced with a monitor that just shows chat
[2:21:10] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Look out! It's a monster!
[2:21:11] <+Troispoint> Blue Lives Matter
[2:21:12] <%joylent_blue> his hat FeelsBadMan
[2:21:12] <Dakuu75> zombie bullet dodging skills have come a long way since old games.
[2:21:13] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Nice 12 misses, Pat.
[2:21:16] <SchroedingersFerret> *CHRIS"S blood
[2:21:16] <Guardiansaiyan> Did Marvin Die already?
[2:21:17] <%JJCheeker> Shoot him in the Dick
[2:21:21] <+BorinCorran> Wesker, you're pitiful!
[2:21:23] <+lethallunacyx> it's like - 20f real feel in Ny. so Canada is probably in an ice age right now.
[2:21:24] <Desertfishing> Pat needs to hit the gun range cause he can't shoot for shit LUL
[2:21:25] <+NiktenKing> Grey Lives Matter
[2:21:26] <Splatterfest> lol
[2:21:29] <%JJCheeker> Worked out well for Eli

[2:21:43] <Cthulos> astronauts still need a healthy intake of water and caffeine makes you piss regardless. seriously, drink water
[2:21:47] <Dakuu75> say-wut
[2:21:47] <santystuffs> nah Mr X is ded by now
[2:21:48] <%DarthFreeman> Is Pat playing some weird difficulty where the zombies don't actually die when you think they die?
[2:21:49] <%DirtyGaijin> Makes for some real tense moments
[2:21:50] <firearmsinstructor> @AngriestPat There's a cool animation if you knife something until it breaks (don't use it to save yourself, slash a zombie on the ground until it snaps)
[2:21:53] <%joylent_blue> oh yea hes dead
[2:21:54] <%connos_livereview> unless x chasin you
[2:21:54] <that_owl_guy> Haven't people routed out returning to the station after you go to the clock tower?
[2:21:55] <%joylent_blue> :(
[2:21:56] <%Aerkk> Yeah they did a really good job with Lickers, but there are a couple that getting rid of makes sense
[2:21:58] <%valriot> @angriestpat et sponsored and then mod in Red Bull Rounds
[2:22:02] <ShoHayabusa> zombLove Licky licky.
[2:22:02] <%Aerkk> At least during the Mr X chase segments
[2:22:05] <Guardiansaiyan> @DarthFreeman its every difficulty
[2:22:05] <+Andrizzleton> until X is on your ass
[2:22:08] <%ElenaManetta> Is there any song that can compete with the save room music?
[2:22:11] <Dakuu75> I had to fight lickers because mr X would chase me into them.
[2:22:13] <%ElenaManetta> MAYBE the basement music in the directors cut.
[2:22:15] <%lewdskeletor13> Licky Licky nice and sticky
[2:22:17] <%Kahnicus> @DarthFreeman Yeah, it's called 'Playing the game' difficulty.
[2:22:20] <PessimisticOptimism> X gon give it to ya
[2:22:20] <+BorinCorran> @lethallunacyx Edmonton is actually reasonable for a change actually. It's -1 right now LUL
[2:22:27] <vampireinarm> Hey Pat you see the video where the guys runs into TWO Mr. x's?
[2:22:30] <%DirtyGaijin> Run and find out
[2:22:31] <Timesteel> lickers also get fucked up by knives
[2:22:37] <nukungfukenny> Sort of like Crimson Heads
[2:22:41] <santystuffs> The game needed more lickers tbh, i think there is like 6 in the entire game?
[2:22:43] <+lethallunacyx> you can knife stun lickers
[2:22:43] <+ahdurian> do you not have to fight the Lickers in the C4 room?
[2:22:46] <%DarthFreeman> Damn, I didn't realize. This is my firs time seeing legit gameplay

[2:23:49] <%JJCheeker> Now it's your desktop background
[2:23:50] <Huitzil37> because like acid rounds are much harder to make than incendiary rounds
[2:23:50] <+BorinCorran> Whenever I hear "Magazine", I just think of Adrian Brody from the King Kong game, "Two magazines on backup"
[2:23:51] <OwlLightningMage> What about the porn though
[2:23:54] <EmpressMoth> @AngriestPat We need a medium sized poster to put that rookie in the office :P
[2:23:54] <Huitzil37> so why would you bother?
[2:23:55] <%BioApple> he loves it
[2:23:55] <%Kahnicus> Thus demonstrating that if we whine enough we will get a Rebecca Bromide. @AngriestPat
[2:23:55] <Tracazoid> So third time's a charm then?
[2:23:57] <SchroedingersFerret> You forgot the locker

[2:24:07] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Call them "clips," to spite the chat, or call them "thingamabobs," because it REALLY doesn't matter for you or elmo.
[2:24:09] <LegendaryDorkKnight> thot slayer pat
[2:24:10] <%Raxus_Secundus> We are the best whiners

[2:24:27] <%ElenaManetta> I dont play games more than once. Once I beat, I throw them away
[2:24:30] <%MyDarkStorm> The Cheerleader Photo
[2:24:30] <KeiPrime> thingamabobs? I got plenty
[2:24:30] <EmpressMoth> its pixelated
[2:24:34] <santystuffs> Actually can you check the main hall laptop this late into the game? @AngriestPat
[2:24:36] <%DarthFreeman> IS that Paige I hear typing in the background?
[2:24:37] <%JJCheeker> She looks even younger and it makes it even creepier
[2:24:39] <%ElenaManetta> That includes digital purchases
[2:24:39] <jobbedbone> its hot tho
[2:24:39] <%CerberusDriver> @ElenaManetta like a true games journalist
[2:24:39] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s Rebecca’s face photoshopped onto a real person
[2:24:42] <%Corporate_Redeemer> It isn't even Rebecca's body in the OG photo
[2:24:45] <%valriot> Dont bad mouth Becky like that
[2:24:46] <%MyDarkStorm> oh
[2:24:47] <Dakuu75> who's the girl in that basketball photo that's Jill or Rebeca?
[2:24:47] <+BorinCorran> @Mittensbro It was a pretty solid mashup of shooter and brawler I felt.
[2:24:47] <Rellim80> If you're not going to show us the picture then at least let us see your feet.
[2:24:48] <%Kahnicus> Who's Typing!?!?
[2:24:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> i mean re2 looked like garbage sooo
[2:24:51] <FunkyStreams> no

[2:24:58] <LegendaryDorkKnight> trash waifu
[2:25:02] <%joylent_blue> Dakuu75 rebecca
[2:25:05] <+Eddy21forsaken> The church of Rebecca will never be satiated
[2:25:06] <%Raxus_Secundus> How can you diss Rebecca like that?
[2:25:07] <LegendaryDorkKnight> jill best girl
[2:25:09] <%MyDarkStorm> Nothing
[2:25:11] <+Yokuho> you cant
[2:25:13] <%Aerkk> @DirtyGaijin Yeah Wesker is just doing his job as a supervisor you guys make it sound weird
[2:25:13] <+Yokuho> yeah see
[2:25:16] <%Kahnicus> Not a damn thing
[2:25:18] <PineappleBison> Rebecca is life
[2:25:20] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat have you ever said fuck it and just try and down Mr. X with everything you got? At least stun?
[2:25:22] <KeiPrime> she's the star of Caliban Cove, you cretins
[2:25:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> huh
[2:25:26] <ospreyworks> Kinda wish they'd gone with the Darkside Chronicles version of this costume for Claire.
[2:25:32] <ospreyworks> The pink denim annoys me.
[2:25:33] <%connos_livereview> i feel bad for rebca always getting creeped on
[2:25:33] <%DirtyGaijin> Rebecca dunks on fools
[2:25:34] <%stolando_florida> @42nfl19 he gets downed for 30 seconds.
[2:25:38] <germanmafia23> How is that laptop connected to the network with no wires in 1998?
[2:25:40] <FunkyStreams> total bummer
[2:25:48] <%Kahnicus> These 1998 ass costumes are the most 80s ass costumes
[2:25:48] <FunkyStreams> bum her?
[2:25:49] <%sirmackslot> what's your current run time?
[2:25:52] <firearmsinstructor> Slash a zombo on the ground until your almost-dead knife breaks if you haven't seen the animation for it yet.
[2:25:52] <%connos_livereview> nanomachines
[2:25:54] <+valkuma> in RE2 wasnt he "Killable" though
[2:25:55] <%DirtyGaijin> not really worth it
[2:25:57] <+Eddy21forsaken> No Rebecca, run cancelled
[2:25:58] <%LogothX> He just got a little whiff of it
[2:26:00] <BanSenpai> did you notice that the game spawns 2 MR.X
[2:26:00] <%Aerkk> @AngriestPat If they make a RE2 Remake RE-Novelization would you buy and read it for the Deep Lore
[2:26:04] <%ElenaManetta> You said ON STREAM in the first 30 seconds NOT THAT TOUGH but then on the podcast, you bragged how tough he was
[2:26:05] <Dakuu75> Rebeca looks super short and has a wicked-tiny frame compared to claire
[2:26:07] <42nfl19> @stolando_florida do you get achievos at least?
[2:26:16] <LegendaryDorkKnight> the costume doesnt have the right shirt
[2:26:17] <Mrthepastyrider> Mr X can take infinity bullets but not a single little baby hit from Birken
[2:26:18] <EmpressMoth> @valkuma You just knocked him out to grab some gun pieces.
[2:26:20] <%stolando_florida> @42nfl19 You get the achievement, "Take a Knee" IIRC
[2:26:22] <FunkyStreams> is that the dif between S and A?
[2:26:22] <%Aerkk> Resident Evil RE-Write
[2:26:29] <+conradical> isn't it 2 hours for the B stories?
[2:26:29] <+BorinCorran> Route B is 3 hours flat for S Pat.
[2:26:34] <%sirmackslot> so S rank is possible with that sidetrack

[2:29:15] <%ElenaManetta> Dont look at me, its my job to look at YOU
[2:29:16] <FatherGreyBeard> Perhaps one of them should be killed?
[2:29:22] <%lewdskeletor13> @angriestpat protip: avoid the poison
[2:29:25] <that_owl_guy> It can keep you from running or aiming for very long stretches of time
[2:29:25] <$birchpeninsula> Pat became a pillarman
[2:29:32] <KeiPrime> this time it interrupts your actions to cough randomly, it sucks
[2:29:36] <AlasterAngelo> if Mr. X took that hat off, would he die?

[2:29:39] <+SpookyCarnage> vineLoog vineLoog3
[2:29:41] <Karv3r> Does poison even reduce hp in this game?
[2:29:43] <santystuffs> real talk if he uses a R+B herb combo he can just go and tank all the poison bukkake
[2:29:47] <santystuffs> it does almost no damage
[2:29:49] <%Kahnicus> A vwasah the pwasah bwavah
[2:29:53] <%Ninestempest> The last CSB missed the FO76 news right
[2:29:55] <%valriot> Just shoot it when its hiding and then run by it
[2:29:56] <Twwit2> Uh, any grenades in the black box?
[2:29:57] <alrobot2014> @torontototoro as many as it takes until the clock breaks
[2:29:59] <%MyDarkStorm> We Should just bury Fallout 76 It Cant Recover at this point
[2:30:03] <LegendaryDorkKnight> be cool if X picked up his hat
[2:30:04] <%Ninestempest> or did it cover the leather jacket
[2:30:05] <+XxTippoxX> the poop virus
[2:30:06] <%Laecerelius> FO76 will be mentioned until it finally dies
[2:30:06] <HeadsHeldHigh> Protip: You can use the left analog stick to move, which will allow you to avoid enemy attacks
[2:30:12] <Dakuu75> @Karv3r honestly I have no idea what it does. I assumed it slowly ticks your HP down

[2:35:48] <Ion_LaserX> Bethesda also says to put the lotion in the basket
[2:35:51] <%Aerkk> Nice Pat
[2:35:53] <+x24sonic> splat pat: he does it
[2:35:54] <%Aerkk> Good moves
[2:35:55] <Shadicara> Punishment will continue until morale improves yikers
[2:35:55] <RCtiger0> Just got back from work. How much of this game has Pat completed of this game?
[2:35:57] <viewtifulr> kenny will remember that
[2:35:58] <%DarthFreeman> @AngriestPat Are you feeling Fucking Huge right now?
[2:35:59] <%ElenaManetta> I've had the flu for two weeks but I want to stay up late every night to watch Pat stream
[2:36:01] <%ElenaManetta> Life is suffering
[2:36:10] <Fien111> Bethesda is also being taken to court if folks didn't hear ***
[2:36:10] <dekkitout> suffer like g
[2:36:12] <%joylent_blue> claire is a champ
[2:36:14] <+x24sonic> you have to suffer like g did in order to live
[2:36:16] <%stolando_florida> @RCtiger0 he's beaten the game but he's practicing speed runs
[2:36:17] <%Aerkk> I hope you recover from the F-Virus Elena
[2:36:18] <RetributionP> how is Clare not a ptsd vegetable from that freaky shit
[2:36:20] <%JJCheeker> Max had such a rough time at that part
[2:36:24] <%DirtyGaijin> Big dick Patrick
[2:36:24] <%Dungeon00X> huge quest
[2:36:24] <%Das_Bass> apatBig
[2:36:26] <%stolando_florida> @angriestpat LEFT: Queen, Bishop, King / RIGHT: Pawn, Rook, Knight
[2:36:31] <%MyDarkStorm> @Agami23 Thats a Joke Right
[2:36:31] <%valriot> apatBig
[2:36:32] <%CerberusDriver> @SpookyCarnage People are getting banned for having messed up inventories or something
[2:36:35] <Djinnazz> I never use any, just bait them.
[2:36:37] <torontototoro> getting banned from FO76 = Ban from all Bethesda launcher games!
[2:36:37] <BurdRightsActivist> god I hated this puzzle on B
[2:36:44] <%joylent_blue> look at Claire and her big dead space gun
[2:36:51] <%MagickBurritoh> Claire looks like she's having a heart attack while running
[2:36:51] <that_owl_guy> Alright. Good job, Pat. Only 1 poisoning during the sewers!
[2:36:54] <RCtiger0> @stolando_florida Thanks
[2:36:54] <%CerberusDriver> yes also if you get banned from 76, you're banned from all Bethesda launcher stuff
[2:36:55] <LegendaryDorkKnight> resident evil protags are basically superheroes
[2:37:06] <dekkitout> is the inventory ban from people getting second hand "hacked" items
[2:37:06] <BurdRightsActivist> Imagine using the bethesda launcher. This post was made by steam gang
[2:37:09] <that_owl_guy> Anybody that bet he would be poisoned only once, you win!
[2:37:10] <alrobot2014> oh that's a shitty punishment
[2:37:10] <+SpookyCarnage> @CerberusDriver Yeah they put in some kind of limit now or something didnt they
[2:37:14] <zombiecraze158> Dead space gun/ Aliens gun is so badass lookin
[2:37:28] <ebonifragaria> Good jerb
[2:37:31] <%Dungeon00X> You the man, pat
[2:37:32] <%Kahnicus> I thought 76 was gonna be terrible when the only thing that sounded interesting in the E3 presentation was nukes, which turned out to be way lamer than the premise.
[2:37:33] <%DirtyGaijin> When i first saw the gun I thought it was like a spike launcher to replace the bowgun
[2:37:34] <+x24sonic> you did ittttt
[2:37:43] <Shadicara> Galaxy brain pat
[2:37:45] <%CerberusDriver> i want FO76 to go free to play, just for the cherry on the shit sundae
[2:37:46] <$birchpeninsula> Time to go save Ada from the dumpster!
[2:37:50] <CrabSlacks> the zap gun looks like one of those salt guns you use to kill flies
[2:37:51] <x00Leon> whats the total completions so far?
[2:37:59] <%DirtyGaijin> save that little shit
[2:38:00] <%MagickBurritoh> Bathesda hasn't shot themselves in the foot, they shot themselves in the heart with 76
[2:38:01] <%joylent_blue> jeez you get so much inventory space in standard mode
[2:38:03] <jobbedbone> woah hes stocked on items
[2:38:04] <%BioApple> I want FO76 to go free to play and somehow that introduces additional bugs
[2:38:05] <%afronooch> 6?
[2:38:05] <reddeadwine1277> Where are we now, errybody?
[2:38:08] <%FracturedImage> ADA WAIT
[2:38:08] <zombiecraze158> Looks especially cool with custom part
[2:38:12] <+SpookyCarnage> @x00Leon 3 I think. He did claire a and leon b on his non-steam account
[2:38:13] <+ButtStevens> time for big crates
[2:38:14] <BurdRightsActivist> Is upgrading to the digital deluxe edition even worth it? I like that costume, and that's about it
[2:38:16] <%DirtyGaijin> Sherry wait?
[2:38:16] <that_owl_guy> People that talk shit about the kid puzzle haven't seen people spend 30 minutes of the chess buttplug puzzle
[2:38:20] <%Kahnicus> @reddeadwine1277 Sewers
[2:38:23] <RCtiger0> Oh yeah didn't Bethesda re-release a previous patch as a new patch and are now banning people from talking about it?
[2:38:23] <merrymsa> We are Claire so Sherry
[2:38:28] <LegendaryDorkKnight> is the bowgun in 5he game?
[2:38:32] <reddeadwine1277> Thanks Kahnicus
[2:38:37] <+SpookyCarnage> @BurdRightsActivist Do you want to give capcom more money? and does the digital deluxe come with the classic soundtrack?
[2:38:38] <+Alig200> @BurdRightsActivist the costume hes using isnt DLC, its in the game by default.
[2:38:39] <%stolando_florida> Not just banning, SILENT banning lmao
[2:38:40] <%CerberusDriver> @RCtiger0 yes and no
[2:38:40] <%Kahnicus> @reddeadwine1277 NP
[2:38:46] <Dakuu75> @that_owl_guy I hate both those puzzels lol
[2:38:49] <%DirtyGaijin> how can this be?
[2:38:49] <%CerberusDriver> @RCtiger0 theyre being banned from the reddit i think
[2:38:55] <OkamiDude15> nice
[2:38:56] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[2:38:57] <%Laecerelius> OH NO
[2:39:00] <vampireinarm> imagine RE with long ass Red Dead 2 animations for simple things like combining Herbs
[2:39:02] <FruitBasketVidya> you dont need to shoot it pat
[2:39:05] <RCtiger0> @CerberusDriver Oh okay
[2:39:06] <zombiecraze158> Pat wth
[2:39:06] <jobbedbone> @RCtiger0 there were regressions in the code which implies their source control has little to no oversight
[2:39:07] <%DirtyGaijin> does the damage here count for the whole fight?
[2:39:08] <$birchpeninsula> @spookycarnage he also did claire a and leon b on his own account off-stream, too
[2:39:10] <+SpookyCarnage> Does shooting the hand speed up the room?
[2:39:15] <%stolando_florida> @SpookyCarnage yes
[2:39:15] <+SpookyCarnage> @birchpeninsula Ahhh
[2:39:16] <%Agami23> wait, does shooting in this section do anything??
[2:39:17] <+Shastafield> LUL
[2:39:18] <%Laecerelius> I'm guessing the damage causes him to break down the door faster?
[2:39:25] <ChiefSombrero> LUL Pro Strats
[2:39:28] <etoir> I don't think you need to shoot it
[2:39:29] <zombiecraze158> Wow that actually worked
[2:39:30] <%DirtyGaijin> frames
[2:39:32] <LegendaryDorkKnight> looks like it yeah
[2:39:32] <Dakuu75> @SpookyCarnage apparently... i'm learning that too, lol
[2:39:37] <%stolando_florida> shooting the hand speeds up the area my dudes
[2:39:39] <+BorinCorran> I'm gonna say it. Claire rocks that fanny pack.
[2:39:40] <+SpookyCarnage> That's incredibly useful
[2:39:41] <dekkitout> meanwhile at anthem, something something mtx, something something "Fuck EA"
[2:39:41] <HyperionXV> @Agami23 Shooting the hand makes it skip a few attacks and go straight to breaking in the door
[2:39:42] <LegendaryDorkKnight> speedrun tech
[2:39:42] <Estuko> If you shoot him enough he becomes disgruntled
[2:39:48] <%DirtyGaijin> ooof
[2:39:51] <BurdRightsActivist> I'm guessing the soundtrack makes it worth, I mostly want the Eliza Walker skin
[2:39:51] <%MagickBurritoh> ow
[2:39:54] <%MyDarkStorm> In Birkin's Mind "MATE!!!!!!!! I Need to Fuck Someone!!!!!!!"
[2:39:55] <+SpookyCarnage> I usually just squat in the corner and wait for him to punch the roof until he gets bored
[2:39:55] <torontototoro> seems like everytime I tune into the stream it's for this sequence. crane game baby!
[2:40:00] <%ElenaManetta> How is Sherry so well behaved for the shitty parents she has and not like... a total asshole kid rebel with dyed black hair.
[2:40:05] <+Andrizzleton> sbfpScared spoopy
[2:40:10] <santystuffs> @BurdRightsActivist you can buy each piece of DLC individually too
[2:40:16] <Dakuu75> birkin seems to hate fire more than acid in this fight
[2:40:17] <%lewdskeletor13> Because Sherry is cool
[2:40:17] <zombiecraze158> Because she barely ever saw her parents
[2:40:18] <+atlasbot1> THATS A BIG EYE
[2:40:18] <RCtiger0> Other than the dumpster fire that is Fallout 76 I just got a new graphics card I've been wanting for a while
[2:40:19] <that_owl_guy> Ok, next bet! Will Pat kill himself with the crane? Vote yes or no now!
[2:40:22] <%DirtyGaijin> She a good kid
[2:40:27] <$birchpeninsula> Give William the knife!
[2:40:29] <%MagickBurritoh> nice
[2:40:32] <Scruffy_Neckbeard> @ElenaManetta Kids like to rebel - if your parents are shitheads, you're going to rebel and be a good kid
[2:40:36] <zombiecraze158> She was probably raised be feckin nannies and shit
[2:40:41] <FruitBasketVidya> pat is wasin ammo
[2:40:41] <BurdRightsActivist> But I get more for my money if I get the deluxe, it's basically free.
[2:40:43] <alrobot2014> does berkin still count as living
[2:40:51] <%ElenaManetta> Get UP ON THE HYDRA'S BACK
[2:40:52] <FruitBasketVidya> just use the crane and get out of the way
[2:40:53] <grayjammer> Sherry seems like the type to go "if im well behaved maybe my parents will love me again"
[2:40:55] <OkamiDude15> cwane sfhUWU
[2:40:55] <Dakuu75> is he immune to dmg when knelt down?
[2:40:55] <%Beough> cwane?
[2:41:00] <kiryuuva> !uptime
[2:41:00] <%LogothX> I hate when games give you the answer to a problem.
[2:41:00] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 41m.
[2:41:01] <+Eddy21forsaken> cwane UwU
[2:41:02] <%UltraCasualBoom> Quane
[2:41:02] <reddeadwine1277> The crane Boss! The crane!
[2:41:04] <+Alig200> @BurdRightsActivist you can buy the Elza costume and OST swap separately, so you dont have to pay for the entire upgrade.
[2:41:04] <Angry_Ev1L> @ElenaManetta because she has high intelligence cause of her superior scientist genes
[2:41:04] <%valriot> cwane uwu
[2:41:05] <%DirtyGaijin> Does he even count as Birkin anymore
[2:41:06] <santystuffs> @FruitBasketVidya he is not, if he does enough damage he can get him with the crane in 1 cycle
[2:41:06] <%joylent_blue> Get UP ON THE HYDRA'S BACK
[2:41:07] <+NiktenKing> Gascrane?
[2:41:07] <NameNumber> This fight is so much easier with Leon. Flamethrower wrecks him.
[2:41:08] <%MagickBurritoh> he wants to do it with only one crane hit
[2:41:10] <BurdRightsActivist> Get UP ON THE HYDRA'S BACK!
[2:41:12] <santystuffs> otherwise it requires 2 cycles
[2:41:15] <Estuko> The cwaine might wewk uwu -claire
[2:41:19] <%DirtyGaijin> bye jojo!

[2:41:32] <ChiefSombrero> LUL
[2:41:33] <Dakuu75> you have to down him 3 times I though
[2:41:33] <$SGrim> NOT GOOD ENOUGH rooKek
[2:41:34] <%Laecerelius> Woof
[2:41:34] <torontototoro> I wanted the stuffed bear, not this writhing mass of flesh

[2:41:35] <%DirtyGaijin> you did it?
[2:41:35] <dekkitout> hehehe

[2:41:36] <Estuko> LUL
[2:41:36] <+Walopoh> DOUBLE FAILSTATE
[2:41:36] <+BorinCorran> His eye needs to be red Pat.
[2:41:37] <+rangriz> Down him 4 times
[2:41:39] <Ion_LaserX> LUL
[2:41:43] <jinking79> Eyeball needs to be Red
[2:41:44] <+Ataraxis9> 4 times
[2:41:46] <$birchpeninsula> Didn't give him the knife!
[2:41:47] <+Walopoh> *FAILSAFE
[2:41:49] <dekkitout> its fine, you already got your achievement
[2:41:49] <thedukeofwolves> He needs to have red eyes for a one crane knockdown.
[2:41:50] <%DirtyGaijin> give him the redeye
[2:41:51] <Dakuu75> -it's untill his eye is really red
[2:41:51] <+Andrizzleton> just gotta cuwate him twice
[2:41:52] <%valriot> Cwaire Wedfield UwU
[2:41:54] <%joylent_blue> what is that hitbox
[2:41:55] <%MagickBurritoh> uncomfortably close
[2:41:58] <HeadsHeldHigh> give im the ol pinkeye
[2:41:59] <%cureneckbeard> crazy talk
[2:42:00] <santystuffs> @AngriestPat eyeball needs to be red thats when you can 1cycle him
[2:42:00] <that_owl_guy> Isn't it faster to just do both crane hits?
[2:42:04] <FruitBasketVidya> yea
[2:42:06] <FruitBasketVidya> it is
[2:42:07] <%lewdskeletor13> Give him pink eye
[2:42:08] <agadejobi> How does this monster's legs support his weight?
[2:42:09] <%DirtyGaijin> saves ammo
[2:42:10] <%BioApple> stand in front of the crate to give it more mass Kappa
[2:42:15] <reddeadwine1277> Red?
[2:42:26] <%stolando_florida> @agadejobi biocurse magic
[2:42:28] <%Kahnicus> Wait.... William Birkin saw The Truth?
[2:42:32] <RCtiger0> Gotta give him the pink eye
[2:42:32] <torontototoro> for once I'd love a game where eyeball is the strong point
[2:42:37] <%Rngiddion> you dont even need to shoot him just hit him with the crane twice
[2:42:37] <ScreamingMeat> Eye turns red when he's about to die
[2:42:41] <Hippineapple228> dont you fight him in resident evil 5?
[2:42:43] <%Laecerelius> I love how the giant arm eye is just like "AWW JEEEZE, BIRKIN!"
[2:42:48] <%Jjrossman> red eye
[2:42:48] <%voidthieff> who the fuck berkin?
[2:42:50] <dekkitout> eyes on the inside are a strong point
[2:42:53] <%Jjrossman> try clear eyes
[2:42:53] <BurdRightsActivist> Birkin just wants the fuck
[2:42:55] <%Bane_Kaikyo> what did I miss?
[2:42:57] <ScreamingMeat> She has the Pink Eye
[2:42:59] <that_owl_guy> Well, at least Pat didn't die to the crane. Its quite salt enducing when Birkin manages to grab you and you both eat shit
[2:43:03] <%Blankets_and_Tea> press x to sherry
[2:43:03] <+Eddy21forsaken> you can do that fight in 1 go?
[2:43:05] <%BioApple> Is that Ellie? You found her in the garbage room
[2:43:06] <Dakuu75> @reddeadwine1277 the big eye ball on his shoulder turns a dark-red when his hp is low-enough to be crane-hit once for the win
[2:43:09] <VioletRosefall> Woolie's home?
[2:43:09] <+Gooniekorn> sherry is a garbage child
[2:43:11] <OkamiDude15> SHEROLD!! doodCrazy
[2:43:12] <$birchpeninsula> So, actual serious question: do those eyeballs G-virus so loves actually functiom as, you know, eyes?
[2:43:12] <santystuffs> "this is your home now Sherry" and then tosses her into the dumpster
[2:43:13] <+OmegaTrigun> D:
[2:43:13] <Angry_Ev1L> killing your parents is taking forever, sherry
[2:43:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> where ada belongs
[2:43:13] <%DirtyGaijin> William Birkin has eyes on the inside but can he see why kids love cinnamon toast crunch
[2:43:14] <zombiecraze158> Sherry wait!
[2:43:16] <%UltraCasualBoom> Give her a backbreaker
[2:43:16] <BigZam> smol tired babby
[2:43:17] <reddeadwine1277> Leon would have made a joke about a red eye flight
[2:43:18] <%CerberusDriver> wait a minute.. that card

[2:43:19] <TafferAA> wait a minute that car

[2:43:21] <%Zaramoth> how old is sherry in this
[2:43:22] <%valriot> she got the G
[2:43:26] <agadejobi> Is that even Birkin anymore? He just seems to be apart of the reanimated biomass at this point
[2:43:27] <HeadsHeldHigh> sweet berry garbage sherry
[2:43:27] <%voidthieff> @Bane_Kaikyo so hype as shit with an eyeball man
[2:43:29] <+roach__> sherry ways a feather it seams
[2:43:29] <%MyDarkStorm> She Gets a
[2:43:29] <+jjjkopf> what do you even like about 6?
[2:43:30] <santystuffs> 8 @Zaramoth
[2:43:33] <%Agami23> sherry now has the sharinGan
[2:43:34] <%Zaramoth> oof
[2:43:38] <LyricaShenans> EVERYTHING'S FINE SHERRY
[2:43:40] <that_owl_guy> Sherry is 12, I think?
[2:43:41] <%DirtyGaijin> Dump her in the sewage
[2:43:41] <%MyDarkStorm> Shea get a Regain
[2:43:42] <lionandfox21> He's Birkin no mo
[2:43:43] <+SpookyCarnage> Just dunk her in the sewer water and obliterate RE6 from the timeline
[2:43:45] <agadejobi> I mean, his head is sticking out the shoulder, but can you really call it Birkin?
[2:43:49] <KeiPrime> mercs in 6 is pretty cool
[2:43:53] <zombiecraze158> She gots the healing power
[2:43:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> never seen anything about re6
[2:43:55] <Finaldragoon> RE6 has the best Mercenaries mode, don't @ me
[2:43:59] <merrymsa> I'm just happy Sherry isn't horribly traumatized by RE2
[2:43:59] <+x24sonic> the fact sherry is in 6 as an adult is literally the only redeeming factor of that game
[2:43:59] <%Kravedarknesss> shes the best thing about 6
[2:44:00] <%MyDarkStorm> Fuckin Keyboard
[2:44:01] <Dakuu75> remember, 7 and this RE2 wouldn't exists without 6
[2:44:05] <$MajorCrasher> griss
[2:44:06] <silvcrest> @Finaldragoon
[2:44:06] <reddeadwine1277> It still has Birkin's dick. probably
[2:44:07] <firearmsinstructor> PAT you forgot THE LOCKER D:
[2:44:09] <merrymsa> and in a mental institution
[2:44:11] <%valriot> you see her butt as well
[2:44:12] <%UltraCasualBoom> Ragu City?
[2:44:12] <Trillex56> sherry birkin is deadpool
[2:44:13] <that_owl_guy> Worst part about 6, not counting plot, was that garbo stamina meter imo
[2:44:14] <agadejobi> What was wrong with RE6?
[2:44:14] <%iwishthiswasicq> @Finaldragoon I will @ you, because you're right.
[2:44:19] <%DirtyGaijin> Shame about the rest of i t
[2:44:20] <+Eddy21forsaken> what about Leon and his gunkata skills
[2:44:22] <%Kahnicus> @agadejobi Well, it's spiteful as fuck like Birkin.
[2:44:25] <Clu_Flynn> 5 still has the best mercenaries mode
[2:44:28] <+dickbuttwoman> I should really play 6
[2:44:29] <+BorinCorran> @SpookyCarnage No you'd have to off Ada, since the plot of 6 revolves around her.
[2:44:29] <wolf_hurricane> Do you think Birkin's dick size was affected by the G-Virus?
[2:44:31] <jacknerik> The biohazard games aren't cannon, right?
[2:44:32] <+dustingunn> RE6 actually has controls fitting for its action, unlike 5 which is a much worse game IMO
[2:44:33] <%DirtyGaijin> the locker pat!
[2:44:33] <%BioApple> PAT DA DONGLE
[2:44:33] <%MyDarkStorm> Sherry gets a healing factor
[2:44:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> THE LOCKER
[2:44:33] <%JJCheeker> 6 was a necessary evil
[2:44:34] <%Blankets_and_Tea> the locker, gotta get the locker
[2:44:37] <+lockbreaker> unpopular opinion: I really liked 6
[2:44:37] <+D2_Synua> 6 would be a lot better if the gameplay was tighter
[2:44:39] <+jjjkopf> also Chris riding that pony in the park
[2:44:41] <Clu_Flynn> BUT PAT, THE LOCKER Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:44:42] <pigeontactician> ada's imaginary co-op friend is the best part of 6
[2:44:43] <iamnotaparrot> I think Girl in is in there somewhere, just not in control.
[2:44:47] <lionandfox21> I wonder if the so called "exploration" of the relationship between Claire and Leon is just Sherry asking them if they're a couple lol
[2:44:47] <+lockbreaker> 6 was fun for coop
[2:44:51] <%ElenaManetta> You say I love you to Elmo more than Paige.
[2:44:53] <zombiecraze158> It’s ghost hunk duh
[2:44:54] <santystuffs> Resident Evil 6 was a good game, it was not a good Resident Evil
[2:44:55] <%lewdskeletor13> RE6 has a few redeeming factors, but it’s still garbo
[2:44:55] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> 👀
[2:44:56] <+Reizie_Etherealm> 6's gameplay feels nice as it is for me
[2:44:58] <zombiecraze158> Ada is hunk
[2:44:58] <AsinineWaffle> Agent in Ada's campaign is so dumb, I love it.
[2:44:58] <wolf_hurricane> @jacknerik Biohazard is the japanese name for Resident Evil, so yes, they are canon
[2:44:58] <%Agami23> they should just make RE:mercenaries as its own game
[2:45:04] <Finaldragoon> watching score attack videos of RE6 Mercenaries on No Mercy difficulty is a thing of beauty
[2:45:08] <CrabSlacks> do you think that'a a black tank-top and shorts or a weird onsie thing?
[2:45:08] <+Alig200> @AngriestPat B Scenario Lab codes are 2048 and 5831. I also have the optimal solution puzzle, if you want to get that record.
[2:45:08] <jacknerik> Those are some high tech ass screens for 1998
[2:45:09] <+SpookyCarnage> @BorinCorran I almost forgot about "HaPpY bIrThDaY aDa"
[2:45:10] <suikudo> Elmo said dont look at me
[2:45:11] <%CerberusDriver> @Agami23 they did for 3DS
[2:45:13] <OkamiDude15> @agadejobi wasnt the main antagonist in 6 some dude who just wanted to fuck ada and she was like naw so he made clones which also led to the infection?
[2:45:13] <reddeadwine1277> @wolf_hurricane Yes. It turned into the rest of his body
[2:45:14] <+x24sonic> @Agami23 they did, it's a 3ds game
[2:45:14] <%DirtyGaijin> The only thing I sort of liked was seeing more interaction between RE protags
[2:45:14] <%UltraCasualBoom> KOF plot in Resident Evil?
[2:45:17] <Guardiansaiyan> @Agami23 with Barry
[2:45:19] <torontototoro> gorgon gaze of the ginger raises kitty from slumber
[2:45:31] <ospreyworks> What does Claire give Sherry with the noir costume?
[2:45:35] <sdgundum990> Regenerators when?
[2:45:40] <Firesparks> resident evil end up being a more iconic name for the series, biohard sounds a bit too generic nowaday
[2:45:41] <ospreyworks> Does she have a jacket?
[2:45:41] <santystuffs> @AngriestPat funfact if you skip the shotgun/grenade launcher it will be in the security room in this section
[2:45:42] <%ElenaManetta> me.............
[2:45:43] <ScreamingMeat> Elmo is like a quantum particle. His state of being changes when you look at him
[2:45:45] <wolf_hurricane> alright guys, you can fuck the ass of ONE Resident Evil character, who is it?
[2:45:49] <zombiecraze158> I don’t think sherry gets another costume.
[2:45:50] <%Bane_Kaikyo> RE6 was a good action shoot bang game.... when it camee to the whole "Resident Evil" it kinda lost the plot a bit
[2:45:51] <%Zaramoth> Sherry
[2:45:53] <DracaenaLeaf> Yooooooooooo
[2:45:54] <Ion_LaserX> Ada
[2:45:55] <%joylent_blue> Leon
[2:45:56] <zombiecraze158> Only the original costumes
[2:45:58] <%stolando_florida> @wolf_hurricane Licker
[2:45:59] <PineappleBison> Rebecca
[2:46:01] <iamnotaparrot> like Birkin seems like he's semi concious and in pain. especially in the OG and DSC since he calls out to Sherry.
[2:46:03] <%anusholeboner> how many times do you think is your max you're gonna play this game? like even a superfan has to get tired of it, right?
[2:46:04] <%lewdskeletor13> There are so many RE protags now it’s hard to fit them all into one game
[2:46:05] <+KragPlays> Ashley
[2:46:10] <%DirtyGaijin> almost
[2:46:10] <PSI_Guy95> eat ass in the mess hall
[2:46:12] <reddeadwine1277> Soulja Boi in the lunch room
[2:46:13] <+BorinCorran> Ada though it's close.
[2:46:14] <MaeMae94> LUL
[2:46:14] <wolf_hurricane> Ashley is the objective best choice
[2:46:16] <Huntercd> Is it too much to hope that this game would have removed RE6 from the timeline?
[2:46:17] <Funcokler_Xerow> is ass always on the menu in that cafeteria?
[2:46:19] <wolf_hurricane> that alt costume Kreygasm
[2:46:23] <%joylent_blue> i'm calling the FBI on this chat rn
[2:46:28] <%hadji087> @AngriestPat how are you even able to remember all the safe and locker combos? is your brain as thick as that mad dick you got?
[2:46:32] <+ButtStevens> who has more protags, kingdom hearts or resident evil
[2:46:34] <wolf_hurricane> reminder Ashley is about 20 in RE4
[2:46:34] <Firesparks> I just want a game where leon and chris team up
[2:46:39] <%FracturedImage> !uptime
[2:46:40] <reddeadwine1277> FBi are the true spooks
[2:46:40] <alrobot2014> so ada can come get us @joylent_blue great thinking
[2:46:40] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 46m.
[2:46:41] <wolf_hurricane> so no, fucking RE4 Ashley is not pedo
[2:46:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL

[2:46:45] <firearmsinstructor> Headbang to some good music
[2:46:47] <+BorinCorran> @joylent_blue Ada's twice my age my dude, s'all good.
[2:46:48] <that_owl_guy> That zombie was actually head banging
[2:46:53] <%valriot> SLIPKNOT
[2:46:54] <pigeontactician> kingdom hearts only has one protagonist tho
[2:46:56] <Geno4344> "you asshole" says the girl who shoots a poor zombie in the face with a glorified taser
[2:47:08] <%DirtyGaijin> Ada is good all the time
[2:47:08] <NameNumber> I love sparkshot in this game.
[2:47:13] <CrabSlacks> well done steak is gross
[2:47:14] <wolf_hurricane> god I love how Claire's alt costume shows off her ass so much
[2:47:15] <%CerberusDriver> toasty
[2:47:18] <zombiecraze158> Spark shot is bae
[2:47:22] <reddeadwine1277> Birkin played the steel barrel on Slipknot-Duality
[2:47:22] <Dakuu75> what is sparkshot particularly strong against?
[2:47:22] <ScreamingMeat> Now Clair doesn't look like she in a sleeveless onsie with booty short bottoms
[2:47:24] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I love the minigun in this game
[2:47:25] <+Meiou> whose up for roast zombie!

[2:48:01] <wolf_hurricane> @BorinCorran i have Kreygasm

[2:48:02] <%Bane_Kaikyo> O H N O
[2:48:03] <torontototoro> Pat is currently part of the double S, or SS club
[2:48:04] <%DirtyGaijin> sweet dance moves
[2:48:04] <firearmsinstructor> Funfact: That USS zombie at the door and Elliot are wearing bulletproof / knifeproof armor. You have to hit the head / limbs.
[2:48:05] <%MagickBurritoh> OH NO
[2:48:05] <%Laecerelius> OH NO
[2:48:06] <ScreamingMeat> In the train when she put Sherry down, Pat skipped it
[2:48:08] <%ThePuddingDead> OH YEAH!
[2:48:08] <RCtiger0> Do you get anything other than trophies or achievements when you get S on everything?
[2:48:14] <%CerberusDriver> MURF
[2:48:15] <codesounds> i'm shock there's no spiders
[2:48:22] <%valriot> o h n o. claire the redfield
[2:48:23] <NameNumber> Zombies, G adults, ivies, and G4 are all weak to sparkshot.
[2:48:25] <wolf_hurricane> @RCtiger0 unlimited ammo weapons depending on difficulty
[2:48:33] <+Alig200> @RCtiger0 nope sadly, you do get a special infinite weapon each for S+ing Leon and Claire tho
[2:48:33] <%DirtyGaijin> Metal gear MURF
[2:48:36] <that_owl_guy> The spiders were just decorations anyway
[2:48:42] <CrabSlacks> RE2 really slaps the llamas OSS
[2:48:42] <%DirtyGaijin> YOU KNEW!

[2:49:07] <EmpressMoth> @AngriestPat I miss the crows

[2:49:14] <%JJCheeker> Honestly giant spiders ridiculous
[2:49:14] <FruitBasketVidya> mgs is dead
[2:49:15] <Angry_Ev1L> they're not real re2 fans
[2:49:16] <Geno4344> They need to make the spiders like the monster from Erie so they can be scary again
[2:49:17] <zombiecraze158> I didn’t like he spiders, they weren’t scary
[2:49:19] <firearmsinstructor> @AngriestPat NEST Laboratory Codes (Scenario B): 2048 & 5831

[2:49:51] <balquisa> Hey thats my ssn
[2:49:55] <%ThePuddingDead> Yknow it just occured to me, since this place self destructs and its practically underneathe Raccoon City....wouldnt the foundations just collapse and the city would sink kilometers under ground?
[2:49:55] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I wish the things the character say like "oh no" and such is more contextual, like if you're taking damage then it's negative and if you're doing big damage then it's positive
[2:49:56] <+SpookyCarnage> @Aydarkzero eliminates random shot spread. pretty handy

[2:50:44] <wolf_hurricane> ngl I don't miss Moth Spiders or Crows at all
[2:50:45] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat is it bad that I enjoyed RE6? To me it was a dumb fun bro-op game I could play with a friend. But so many people seem to hate it.
[2:50:51] <lloyddboy> O N O
[2:50:52] <NameNumber> They could've done a cool update for the moth.
[2:50:59] <%ThePuddingDead> so thats insta -.....
[2:50:59] <balquisa> The code is your credit card number, the expiration and the 3 digits

[2:51:06] <+atlasbot1> Hey @AngriestPat i just saw bumblebee today it was pretty RAD
[2:51:07] <that_owl_guy> Who knows. Moth might be in shadow survivors
[2:51:08] <+SpookyCarnage> @42nfl19 Any game, even bad games, can be fun in co-op
[2:51:09] <jacknerik> This is where he died in the RE2 lp
[2:51:09] <zombiecraze158> Feckin creepy
[2:51:12] <Dakuu75> I don't think you can perma put these down right?
[2:51:16] <TafferAA> takes two flame rounds anyways LuL
[2:51:22] <wolf_hurricane> yeah you can, just takes more ammo @Dakuu75
[2:51:22] <ScreamingMeat> 2048 5831
[2:51:23] <%DirtyGaijin> I dont remember it taking two
[2:51:23] <+DrToxicMasculinity> You can move and shoot? That's bullshit
[2:51:23] <zombiecraze158> Yes you can
[2:51:24] <Dao_Puppy> Shou've replaced them with something. This game really only has zombies, lickers, and goo monsters.
[2:51:29] <Geno4344> he should've learned to stop drop and roll
[2:51:30] <%JJCheeker> That is stupid
[2:51:33] <%joylent_blue> Dakuu75 you can with fire
[2:51:35] <%LogothX> What are these omikron numbers
[2:51:38] <gustavozxd> you can kill them with one bullet and then just knife them
[2:51:40] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@lionandfox21) (warning)
[2:51:40] <+BorinCorran> @42nfl19 RE6 to me is the definition of "Perfectly fine". If nothing else you fight a T-Rex in a helicopter.
[2:51:49] <+Reizie_Etherealm> It's not a bad thing to enjoy things that others might not, as long as you stay in your lane about it I don't see it being a bad thing
[2:51:50] <Dakuu75> @wolf_hurricane @joylent_blue ah, cool. very good to know
[2:51:51] <%Kahnicus> @42nfl19 I hear tell it's fun if you don't go in with a hate boner for it not being a good RE game.
[2:51:53] <that_owl_guy> I just use acid rounds on Ivys. But I want to hurry the fuck up past them, lol
[2:51:55] <%Codemaster7777> Oh shit its B not A
[2:51:59] <+Alig200> @AngriestPat Solution Puzzle: Blue Red Green Blue Red Green Blue Red Green
[2:52:00] <derekwst3> i wonder if there is a secret code for that
[2:52:01] <Guardiansaiyan> @LogothX David Cage makes a cameo at the end of this campaign
[2:52:05] <converterv2> Blue, Red, Green, Red, Blue, Red, Blue, Green, Blue, Red, Green
[2:52:08] <wolf_hurricane> I MADE THE BAD GAME
[2:52:13] <gustavozxd> @kahnicus Chris campaing and merc mode is fun but leon and jake are meeeh
[2:52:17] <royal_hyena> There's a hallway blocked off with moths flying around it. Could be a hint to DLC in the future. Something giant moth related.
[2:52:25] <garbageheaphound> holy shit
[2:52:30] <Splatterfest> Ivy killing is a waste of time just run past after a shot to orange
[2:52:32] <HeadsHeldHigh> moth girls dlc confirmed
[2:52:32] <garbageheaphound> i just had a heart attack
[2:52:32] <converterv2> for B scenario
[2:52:33] <Thalchampz> how does this lab not catch on fire with all the plants
[2:52:33] <balquisa> jermaFireman
[2:52:36] <reddeadwine1277> boosh!
[2:52:37] <+valkuma> @AngriestPat if youre not going to shoot their nodes, you dont need to use a needle. 2 flame rounds will do it. THe needle does nothing
[2:52:39] <%JJCheeker> So is you know who coming back?
[2:52:40] <zombiecraze158> Can’t wait for ghost survivors
[2:52:41] <Wan6Saber> sounds like a croc
[2:52:41] <%ThePuddingDead> looks like
[2:52:45] <ZeonAceVS> They could have made the spiders better in this version. Spiders were always a staple of old RE’s. Maybe they’ll show up in the DLC.
[2:52:47] <+DrToxicMasculinity> I liked RE6 a bit' I even liked Raccoon City haha
[2:52:47] <42nfl19> LAMP
[2:52:50] <NameNumber> Best thing to do with ivies is just pop one polyp and run past while they reel
[2:52:50] <%cureneckbeard> 20 48 58 31
[2:52:51] <that_owl_guy> Acid rounds stun the fuck out of them
[2:52:53] <gustavozxd> just shoot their balls
[2:52:56] <+Reizie_Etherealm> FLAME ON!
[2:52:57] <$birchpeninsula> @logothx they are negative numbers. imagine them as a full blue block, then remove the shape of the number
[2:52:58] <+Andrizzleton> i acid shot them and ran
[2:52:59] <Dakuu75> there's an achievment for shooting all the buds off one I hink
[2:53:00] <HeadsHeldHigh> plant testicles
[2:53:04] <ChiefSombrero> Ivy Stir Fry
[2:53:09] <gustavozxd> wasting time and ammo LUL
[2:53:10] <+D2_Synua> Shooting the balls just incapitates them
[2:53:11] <$lolslowking> In my experience, a needle knocks down and one flame round kills
[2:53:13] <+Alig200> @AngriestPat Solution Mix Puzzle: Blue Red Green Blue Red Green Blue Red Green
[2:53:14] <%DirtyGaijin> Claire just tanking that point blank flame
[2:53:15] <%ThePuddingDead> god I hate stir fry
[2:53:17] <KishinGrek> Stop it, hes already dead
[2:53:18] <FruitBasketVidya> @AngriestPat you gotta shoot the bulbs on the plant dudes then set them on fire so you dont waste two grenade ammos

[2:53:56] <%ThePuddingDead> i think it is
[2:54:00] <that_owl_guy> If you are low on ammo, you can also just run into an Ivy and use an item to escape
[2:54:01] <silvcrest> Nice
[2:54:04] <%ElenaManetta> SCIENCE
[2:54:09] <%Aydarkzero> wait what!?

[2:56:56] <Guardiansaiyan> oh
[2:57:04] <Guardiansaiyan> lol
[2:57:06] <Dakuu75> so, are the S ranks and such purely time based? does it matter how much you heal/save?
[2:57:07] <+Andrizzleton> are the grenade launcher upgrades usless?

[2:57:33] <%Dungeon00X> mmmmmmmm, Paige brains
[2:57:33] <%Kahnicus> @gustavozxd I can do action games, horror was what took me time to break into
[2:57:33] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @AngriestPat how much do you want to bet RE2make will get GOTY?
[2:57:33] <%Faustgesicht> goodness
[2:57:38] <%jiin6> you thought about paige's brain taste alot, haven't you pat?
[2:57:38] <%Laecerelius> S+ requires no infinite weapons and 3 or less saves
[2:57:40] <Dakuu75> what-the-HELL that fucking licker attacks me everytime!
[2:57:40] <KishinGrek> Did you get the achievement for knocking Berkin off with the crane only once?
[2:57:42] <gustavozxd> didn't feel scared at all, considering I could parry everything and had dual guns, not scary at all, also cheap jump scares
[2:57:46] <PSI_Guy95> FROSTY NIPS
[2:57:50] <%DirtyGaijin> oh you
[2:57:51] <reddeadwine1277> Damn...Should've worn pants..
[2:57:53] <+Reizie_Etherealm> There are scripted events in RE6 that is supposed to be a scare but after the first time it's like "I have to walk into this obvious trap to trigger this event"
[2:57:54] <+XxTippoxX> shoulda parked my packa
[2:57:54] <Geno4344> Pat would you eat elmo
[2:57:56] <ospreyworks> I can't believe how well the old soundtrack and sound effects hold up.
[2:58:07] <KeiPrime> thought they coulda done more with this part, like having zombies attack you while it cools or something
[2:58:07] <%jiin6> Claire: where my jeans?
[2:58:12] <JonKhan> Does spark work on lickers?
[2:58:12] <%valriot> Wrong
[2:58:14] <$Chimeraelite> Jeez
[2:58:23] <%stolando_florida> @AngriestPat you can use the infinite knife
[2:58:26] <that_owl_guy> So go fast and don't save. Challenge accepted
[2:58:27] <+BorinCorran> @reddeadwine1277 She road halfway across the country on a bike in those cutoffs. Woman has thighs of steel.
[2:58:28] <%Laecerelius> But you can still get an S with infinite weapons
[2:58:28] <MachigattaLT> i already got my S+, its easy on standard
[2:58:31] <MachigattaLT> is this hc?
[2:58:32] <TafferAA> but only if you cheat
[2:58:35] <MachigattaLT> oh no, his inventory
[2:58:37] <Cthulos> !uptime
[2:58:37] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 58m.
[2:58:38] <MachigattaLT> so this is stan
[2:58:38] <lethallylactic> Zap muthafucka
[2:58:40] <lionandfox21> I thought the time was 3:30 for standard ?
[2:58:42] <%DirtyGaijin> Ive time
[2:58:48] <MachigattaLT> its 3h30 on standard yeah
[2:58:53] <%Kahnicus> @gustavozxd Actually, I got RE HD and 0 HD, and Revelations 1 and 2 on Summer Sale last year and have only gotten through 1 HD so far, got a little ways before I move on to others
[2:58:56] <%ElenaManetta> And my eyes
[2:58:57] <TheHeroAppears> dang pat didn't get spooked
[2:58:59] <$iRashonal> cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 some thanks for being my background noise while I jump back into Darkest Dungeon for the umpteenth time. Rock on ya ginger fuck
[2:59:00] <KishinGrek> Ahh muh face
[2:59:03] <that_owl_guy> I heard Leon and Claire have different clear times?
[2:59:04] <%valriot> S+ is just same as S requirement but 3 saves max and no infinite guns
[2:59:06] <+Arbal3st> Its the framerate gun
[2:59:06] <ScreamingMeat> The Spark Shot is a fucked up weapon when you think about it
[2:59:06] <Fuji_Apples> yea my frames disappear during the spark
[2:59:07] <+Alig200> @MachigattaLT you get the infinte rocket launcher/minigun from getting S+ on Hardcore with Leon/Claire respectively, if that floats your boat.
[2:59:12] <+SpookyCarnage> I wonder what kind of god level PC they have at capcom that doesn't hitch a little when you use the sparkshot
[2:59:13] <+Yokuho> The time for S+ is the same as S, the difference is that you can only save 3 times and not use infinite weapons
[2:59:14] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> might be because of the smoke
[2:59:18] <reddeadwine1277> Who wears short jorts? Claire wears short jorts!
[2:59:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> HEADSHOTS MAKE THEM HUMP
[2:59:21] <RCtiger0> So with the RX 580 I just bought, would I be able to run this game pretty good?
[2:59:21] <%Laecerelius> A and B have different clear times, not Claire and Leon
[2:59:24] <MachigattaLT> yeah ive S ranked hardcore but not S+ yet
[2:59:25] <+DamnKrazy> graphics go down
[2:59:25] <%Kahnicus> @gustavozxd And now this one too.
[2:59:29] <MachigattaLT> hunks gun is fucking good though goddamn
[2:59:31] <NameNumber> Not saving any spark for G4?
[2:59:35] <MachigattaLT> S+ just means under 3 saves
[2:59:35] <FruitBasketVidya> @iRashonal where is a good place to read about how to get into darkest dungeon
[2:59:36] <firearmsinstructor> Just has to be 3 saves or less
[2:59:39] <+Andrizzleton> Hardcore S rank is 2:30
[2:59:39] <gustavozxd> @kahnicus rev2 is one of my favorites, sad that people ignored it mostly because it was episodic at the time
[2:59:40] <JeffBoyRDeeee> no its not
[2:59:48] <Ugato> oh interesting
[3:00:01] <ScreamingMeat> Nerf Gun is kinda bad for G4 because of the charge time
[3:00:12] <Desertfishing> S+ requires you to twerk on cam
[3:00:16] <NameNumber> 2:30 for A, 2:00 for B.
[3:00:29] <lilStrife> @RCtiger0 Yeah you should do just fine. My 480 can run it.
[3:00:31] <%Kahnicus> @gustavozxd Yeah, it looks pretty good, and fortunately the episodes were like 99 cents, maybe 75 each.
[3:00:33] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:00:39] <reddeadwine1277> Gotta do that booty scooty for that S rank
[3:00:43] <+freshlemon8> G4 is when you fight him on the elevator right?
[3:00:43] <Ugato> pat loves it because it guarantees a kill
[3:00:45] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat how would you feel if they remade Resident evil Zero with this engine
[3:00:49] <+Andrizzleton> SSS rank is male presenting nipples on stream
[3:00:50] <that_owl_guy> Rev2 is one of the best RE games, easily
[3:00:51] <%MisterTylerrr> Man how does he have this much shit on B run? I didn't have SHIT Leon's B run.
[3:00:53] <%valriot> Do the knife strat on the next boss @angriestpat apatBig NUTS
[3:01:05] <forlorncarton> Hardcore S+ 2:30
[3:01:06] <%valriot> Thats only Hardcore
[3:01:07] <CrabSlacks> Claire is gonna get fired :(
[3:01:08] <TafferAA> because standard is easy as shit
[3:01:17] <JeffBoyRDeeee> knife strat too good
[3:01:26] <+aspirationdeath> @derekwst3 They wouldnt.
[3:01:26] <%ElenaManetta> They have this AMAZING text to speech in 1998 but smart phones have yet to be invented
[3:01:36] <BurdRightsActivist> So i played claire a and Leon b, for my playthrough. I wasn't able to change my ammo for the revolver pistol when I got the good shit, is that a bug? Ps4 btw
[3:01:39] <reddeadwine1277> Get away from my dongle you monster!
[3:01:45] <%MisterTylerrr> @TafferAA I mean..I'm just awful but damn
[3:01:48] <%AncelDeLambert> @BurdRightsActivist it's Patriot tech
[3:01:49] <that_owl_guy> Wow. I have literally never seen an Ivy follow you into that room before
[3:01:53] <vampireinarm> so are these people turned plants, plants turned zombies, or something else
[3:01:59] <+Eddy21forsaken> I got S+ Leon A in 2:50 on Standard 2:30 is hardcore probably
[3:01:59] <+XxTippoxX> man this company really sucks to work for, right?
[3:02:05] <+jjjkopf> why not both
[3:02:07] <+Alig200> @BurdRightsActivist thats normal, Claire's revolver/magnum is able to cycle between her handgun rounds and magnum rounds.
[3:02:09] <$iRashonal> @FruitBasketVidya Darkest Dungeon subreddit does a good job of teaching the basics. I didn't start following it until recently I kinda ran in blind and learned through pain
[3:02:18] <NameNumber> It spawns when you grab the chip.
[3:02:22] <%DirtyGaijin> @BurdRightsActivist did you get the reinforced upgrade for the pistol?
[3:02:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Athletes Foot is no joke.
[3:02:34] <BurdRightsActivist> @DirtyGaijin That explains it, nope.
[3:02:34] <CrabSlacks> the safety rails on those catwalks are really short, not OSHA approved
[3:02:36] <Ugato> people that got planted?
[3:02:37] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Plaaaaaaant people Plaaaaaaant people
[3:02:38] <%ElenaManetta> Who is worse: Umbrella or MOBIUS?
[3:02:38] <DracaenaLeaf> implants
[3:02:39] <OkamiDude15> they got norted by plant 43
[3:02:40] <Guardiansaiyan> Mister X woke up
[3:02:41] <%sirmackslot> Why is this place so big given the amount of actual workspace?
[3:02:42] <that_owl_guy> Its a trifecta of G fuckassery
[3:02:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Show feet btw.
[3:02:43] <ebonifragaria> They got soiled
[3:02:44] <+timblenaut> 2 items there?
[3:02:45] <%jiin6> implanted apatSmug
[3:02:45] <Ugato> like they got power bombed or something???
[3:02:45] <+SpookyCarnage> If thats the case, why was there a completely unaltered human body in the room where you got the ID chip
[3:02:45] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Look like plant, talk like people
[3:02:46] <%lewdskeletor13> MOBIUS
[3:02:49] <HeadsHeldHigh> soylent green
[3:02:54] <+Arbal3st> "Get planted" sounds like weed reference
[3:03:00] <lionandfox21> The memo in Dr. Li's email confirms they're folks who got absorbed by plant 43
[3:03:01] <%Prism_Wing> "i've already been soiled"
[3:03:03] <%DirtyGaijin> @BurdRightsActivist its in the sewers outside the chess puzzle
[3:03:03] <%AncelDeLambert> dangit, I said that joke to the wrong person cuz the chat moved!
[3:03:06] <Ugato> kevin nash is really Mr. X?!?
[3:03:08] <Guardiansaiyan> @sirmackslot Umbrella can afford the FINEST in ego and compensation for tiny dicks money can buy!
[3:03:08] <%jiin6> seeds up the butt
[3:03:11] <manjiclan> theyy got soile by forest kaysen
[3:03:14] <%NWR_James> I like that Umbrella wasn't content with a zombie virus, they needed plant people too
[3:03:14] <ShichiNoBushi> "AWS". That's what happens when Elmo is on screen.
[3:03:17] <%MisterTylerrr> @SpookyCarnage Cause he got hard murdered
[3:03:24] <+dickbuttwoman> How does he have so many flame rounds?
[3:03:26] <Cthulos> There is documents in this game that said people are turning into plants
[3:03:26] <%valriot> KNIFE
[3:03:33] <OkamiDude15> @MachigattaLT links get deleted by nightbot
[3:03:33] <TafferAA> too much ammmo
[3:03:35] <%vincerocmm> apatBig
[3:03:38] <lethallylactic> Standard 2ez
[3:03:39] <firearmsinstructor> S+ requirements: No unlockable / infinite weapons, 3 saves maximum, Standard A: 3 hours 30 minutes Standard B: 3 hours & Hardcore A: 2 hours 30 minutes, Hardcore B: 2 hours
[3:03:40] <that_owl_guy> Ivys are the result of somebody being way too into Poison Ivy
[3:03:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> woof
[3:03:41] <%AncelDeLambert> Umbrella is that executive in the Yahtzee bit talking about "horror happens"
[3:03:47] <+Gooniekorn> birkin is gonna get fucked up
[3:03:49] <Guardiansaiyan> @NWR_James they wanted to appease the market who cares about the environment and so made plant weapons...to reduce green house gasses
[3:03:51] <%AncelDeLambert> just, vaguely waving its hand in the air
[3:03:54] <Geno4344> Can Plant 43 beat Plant 42?
[3:03:59] <ShichiNoBushi> He said before that since the ivies can be perma-killed with the flame rounds to save them for this part of the game.
[3:04:01] <Ion_LaserX> Umbrella wanted to diversify its monster portfolio
[3:04:07] <%AncelDeLambert> "And then bioweapons.... happen" *he said, cheeks puffing out*
[3:04:07] <RCtiger0> You can probably kill all the zombies in the city with all that ammo you got.
[3:04:15] <%Laecerelius> Diversify yo bonds!
[3:04:15] <%valriot> Do the knife strat coward
[3:04:19] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Conservation, Pat. That's the word
[3:04:19] <%ElenaManetta> Wanna brag about it?
[3:04:19] <Ugato> no the 43 series is just 42 but with a critical flaw introduced
[3:04:22] <%Kahnicus> Pat is also impressed by his own hoarding, chat.
[3:04:22] <Guardiansaiyan> @Ion_LaserX they wanted to reduce green house emissions and their carbon footprint
[3:04:24] <that_owl_guy> No kidding
[3:04:29] <%DirtyGaijin> time to use it all
[3:04:29] <%ElenaManetta> Boivin the Braggart
[3:04:29] <Ugato> (I don't actually know)
[3:04:34] <%Ciglossonjr> Pat the locker

[3:06:21] <reddeadwine1277> That's the power of rage for ya
[3:06:21] <MachigattaLT> his voice actor needed more time in the spotlight
[3:06:22] <%Kahnicus> Spite is Birkin's food, rage his water. @AngriestPat
[3:06:24] <digimonda> Wasn't he already infected by the time he was shot though?
[3:06:25] <$Jmann1892> G Virus Regenerates Cells Pat
[3:06:25] <Guardiansaiyan> @DirtyGaijin to transform...yes
[3:06:25] <Angry_Ev1L> he was that mad

[3:06:39] <Guardiansaiyan> @digimonda after being shot he injected himself with the virus
[3:06:42] <+dickbuttwoman> And there's the implantion
[3:06:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> get rekt bitch
[3:06:46] <santystuffs> @ZephynM rip, sorry to hear that
[3:06:48] <+ButtStevens> yeet
[3:06:48] <reddeadwine1277> blamsos
[3:06:49] <The_Cysquatch> There's that big divorce claw at work.
[3:06:49] <+miguelrod777> guess I'll just watch
[3:06:49] <digimonda> eh, close enough
[3:06:49] <+Calderbad> maybe don't monologue near a zombie monstrosity
[3:06:54] <lethallylactic> I love how neither Chris nor Leon even attempt to shoot Birkin there. LUL
[3:06:55] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> hooray for internal bleeding!
[3:06:57] <Huntercd> There were babies in that orphanage too
[3:07:01] <+SpookyCarnage> vine1more
[3:07:01] <dekkitout> so whats the over under on g virus giving you rad powers and not eyes on the inside but outside
[3:07:03] <%rdark_ksu> Man what i always loved about RE is the fact that the G virus just fucking creates mass
[3:07:03] <Guardiansaiyan> @The_Cysquatch so where i the prenup spike?
[3:07:04] <adamisfruit> Yeeted
[3:07:09] <NumbusPlays> ARE YOU SORRY?
[3:07:09] <kiryuuva> Annette should've died from internal bleeding
[3:07:11] <$TheNeedlesD> So why is Claire a surrogate mother to a lot of girls in the RE universe. Sherry, that one girl in Degeneration, Moira in Revelations 2
[3:07:13] <%MagickBurritoh> HAND WINGS
[3:07:14] <%Kahnicus> Birkin has the curse mark!
[3:07:16] <ZephynM> @santystuffs Thanks mate. I'll try again tomorrow though, it was fun.
[3:07:18] <%stolando_florida> @dekkitout it gives eyes on the inside
[3:07:18] <%galaxyswirl> i love claire's version of annette
[3:07:18] <+Yokuho> @AngriestPat You can see Birkin's face on G's chest
[3:07:19] <%ElenaManetta> I mean, it worked the first time
[3:07:22] <%maskedriderhero> At this stage, theres nothing left of Birkin right?
[3:07:23] <%Laecerelius> Yeah it's not like they're innocent scientists who got duped into making horrible monstrosities. They totally knew what they were doing and are huge scumbags.
[3:07:25] <NumbusPlays> are you actually fucking sorry for killing the giant zombie monster?
[3:07:25] <+Calderbad> he gets so big he goes ful circle and somehow gets smaller
[3:07:25] <%Kahnicus> And has seen The Truth!
[3:07:27] <ScreamingMeat> Berkin fucks her up significantly more on Leon A
[3:07:27] <Belutima> Stun him
[3:07:28] <ZephynM> There's a strange thrill to try-harding hardcore with no saves.
[3:07:28] <firearmsinstructor> Acid rounds don't do shit against him in this phase, UNLESS you make a direct hit to his eye (stock for the launcher comes in handy here)
[3:07:28] <Geno4344> >Monster grabs human >Throws them into a wall instead of disemboweling or eating them why do they always do this
[3:07:29] <%RaikenTB> No shut up though LUL
[3:07:29] <%Kahnicus> And a third anime reference!
[3:07:30] <vampireinarm> why do monsters with giant arms and claws insist on grabbing you and then tossing you instead of tearing you apart
[3:07:30] <+Krivvan> @rdark_ksu: clearly it's using the air around it
[3:07:32] <%PlainSimpleTailor> DON'T question it Pat
[3:07:32] <yosukecchi> just got here, those shorts are super cute
[3:07:33] <%Agami23> william just activated his curse mark

[3:07:38] <RCtiger0> Ripley Redfield
[3:07:40] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Titty face
[3:07:40] <that_owl_guy> Better than just watching Birkin claw your spine out
[3:07:40] <jacknerik> This PS1 music mariaPup
[3:07:41] <%walternatorz> She's a scientist, one result really isn't conclusive
[3:07:41] <KishinGrek> Wheres Berkins face?
[3:07:42] <Zooperton> SourPls
[3:07:44] <+BorinCorran> Claire is so cool in this cutscene!
[3:07:45] <CrabSlacks> RIP AND TEAR until it's done!
[3:07:45] <lethallylactic> I think it's cool how in Claire's route she chooses to fight G3 whereas in Leon's Annette forces him to.
[3:07:46] <%MagickBurritoh> Fuck you Annette
[3:07:46] <%DirtyGaijin> Claires a badass
[3:07:47] <%Kahnicus> SHOOT. THE ASS.

[3:08:01] <%DirtyGaijin> pat big bitch
[3:08:02] <ZephynM> Daaaang, Pat's loaded
[3:08:02] <%Beough> in leon's campaign it's like he's trapped with G, in Claire's she's like BITCH YOU'RE TRAPPED WITH ME!
[3:08:04] <+Andrizzleton> Leon gets tricked into fighting G but Claire says Fuck it I'll do it myself
[3:08:04] <Sorasan22> PogChamp
[3:08:05] <Geno4344> Like the time where you fight him on the elevator?
[3:08:07] <santystuffs> Im actually more surprised on Umbrella, they coulda used Birkin as the perfect scapegoat since he did went AWOL, but instead just pushed more BOW's into Raccoon City confirming their involvment
[3:08:09] <that_owl_guy> Is it time for LOCKER STRATS
[3:08:09] <dekkitout> wow they really are hand wings
[3:08:11] <%Kahnicus> You made Birkin a flamer.
[3:08:16] <$birchpeninsula> No, Pat, tht is the OPPOSITE of cool
[3:08:16] <+dramajoe> this track
[3:08:17] <garbageheaphound> that looks so fucking coo
[3:08:19] <+valkuma> he takes no damage from fire.
[3:08:22] <+DK_Rance> jesus pat lol

[3:08:26] <lloyddboy> hitboxes
[3:08:26] <%Aitch971> perfect aim
[3:08:28] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Did that actually hit?!
[3:08:28] <DracaenaLeaf> that didn't even hit
[3:08:28] <%DirtyGaijin> return of the aim
[3:08:29] <that_owl_guy> Hitboxes, ladies and gentlemen
[3:08:30] <NameNumber> Dat hitbox.
[3:08:30] <KishinGrek> This fight was fun
[3:08:30] <%valriot> apatHoldon
[3:08:31] <%Ciglossonjr> THE LOCKER PAT
[3:08:31] <DeanX27> Setting him on fire transforms him from an RE boss to a Souls boss

[3:08:32] <%lesbianmimikyu> apatWhat
[3:08:34] <+EVOriginal> atpTryAiming
[3:08:34] <%FracturedImage> apatBig WIFF
[3:08:34] <+BorinCorran> Fun fact, you can fuck Birkin up REALLY bad with the flamethrower in Leons. I did it in my last run 10/10 time.
[3:08:34] <OkamiDude15> that didnt hit woopsKek
[3:08:36] <+Andrizzleton> how can you switch from original soundtrack to new soundtrack on PC?
[3:08:36] <firearmsinstructor> @Ciglossonjr lol :)
[3:08:37] <+dickbuttwoman> @valkuma How's he with acid? This stage and the next?
[3:08:39] <%walternatorz> hitbox notporn.
[3:08:40] <%MisterTylerrr> The hitbox on that sucksd
[3:08:41] <silvcrest> Got hit by the air pressure!?!
[3:08:43] <JeffBoyRDeeee> use acid rounds
[3:08:46] <Splatterfest> HEY did you get that rol film?!!
[3:08:46] <Jaxnos> big hits
[3:08:49] <RetributionP> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[3:08:53] <%Laecerelius> Wouldn't the SMG be better for the small eyes?
[3:08:55] <%MagickBurritoh> he looks rad
[3:08:56] <+Alig200> @Andrizzleton it should be the last option in the audio settings if you have the DLC for it.
[3:08:57] <+dickbuttwoman> @valkuma It feels like the acid does nothing compared to the magnum shots
[3:08:58] <Guardiansaiyan> I don't see Birkins face in this form
[3:08:58] <$Jmann1892> I like my G monster Extra Crispy pls
[3:09:03] <+Thornarn> !raffle
[3:09:05] <+Alig200> @Laecerelius the SMG is god tier against this boss.
[3:09:06] <HeadsHeldHigh> pop
[3:09:07] <OkamiDude15> @Andrizzleton if you buy the dlc you can switch between them in the audio settings
[3:09:08] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> That splorch sound
[3:09:09] <%Zaramoth> why eyeballs
[3:09:14] <that_owl_guy> This game would be so trivial if they added RE3's dodge mechanic
[3:09:14] <MachigattaLT> the grenade launcher is so weak on bosses
[3:09:15] <%Zaramoth> whyballs
[3:09:15] <%valriot> Boooo, didnt use the knife
[3:09:16] <PlumpPotatoRump> hello 🥔🥔🥔
[3:09:17] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Insight Increased
[3:09:17] <%MagickBurritoh> EYES ON THE INSIDE
[3:09:19] <$birchpeninsula> Grant us eyes!
[3:09:20] <+valkuma> @dickbuttwoman he gets staggered from acid on ALL attacks so its very useful to damage him. The only damage that matters is hitting the heart. Needles/Bullets work
[3:09:21] <ScreamingMeat> GRANT US EYES
[3:09:22] <%JJCheeker> Looks like a Demon
[3:09:24] <MachigattaLT> you literally cannoy kill HC g5 with it
[3:09:25] <OkamiDude15> birkin has obtained eyes on the inside woopsCult
[3:09:26] <Jaxnos> so much ammo, my god
[3:09:27] <%Dingus_Tickler> Yeah, I find it harder to fight this boss as Claire. I usually always have a better time as Leon.
[3:09:28] <$swiggityswooty4dabooty> How you have that many SMG bullets is baffling
[3:09:32] <jacknerik> Final fantasy ass music
[3:09:33] <TafferAA> more fire
[3:09:33] <+Andrizzleton> @Alig200 thanks, never thought to look in the settings sbfpSetIn
[3:09:34] <dekkitout> if hellsing taught me anything, its that more eyes can be totally cool
[3:09:35] <+valkuma> Fire rounds do actually nothing, and Acid ROunds are only useful to stagger him for easy hits
[3:09:38] <%Kahnicus> Oh god, why did we design this virus with super obvious weak spots? It's like putting fuck me lights on your Gundam!
[3:09:38] <brambobelurkin> Birkin the original eyes on the inside
[3:09:38] <MachigattaLT> HC g5 will die to the friggin pistols
[3:09:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> "why eyeballs" Look up Teratomas
[3:09:40] <+Arbal3st> Noooo my big glowing weakness! How did you know?
[3:09:42] <%joylent_blue> apatBig FIRE
[3:09:42] <ScreamingMeat> G-Virus was the Old Blood all along
[3:09:44] <%harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt> Why not reverse how you shoot with the magnum and uzi? @AngriestPat
[3:09:48] <+dickbuttwoman> Ah, so the needles work too?
[3:09:53] <bigbradish> Does that even hurt him?
[3:09:55] <%MagickBurritoh> ...What was umbrella planning on doing with this virus? making DOOM happen?
[3:09:59] <Geno4344> Can Birkin defeat the Orphan of Kos?
[3:10:01] <+SpookyCarnage> Oh no, his leg-eyeballs are open
[3:10:01] <pillowwasp> It hurts my eyes
[3:10:04] <%DirtyGaijin> Birkin just plagiarising the old blood
[3:10:04] <+valkuma> dickbuttwoman yes if you get needles on his heart it does TONS of damage.
[3:10:07] <KishinGrek> Just constantly on fire
[3:10:07] <that_owl_guy> Perhaps this means G was the true Evil Within
[3:10:09] <MachigattaLT> @MagickBurritoh the virus wasn't umbrellas
[3:10:11] <NameNumber> Acid grenades are better for this because they stun.
[3:10:11] <Dakuu75> second GEAR
[3:10:12] <MachigattaLT> birkin went rogue
[3:10:16] <HeadsHeldHigh> The grenade launchers are only effective with direct hits on eyeballs I think
[3:10:17] <Splatterfest> you made him charcoal
[3:10:22] <+Spikyshrike> I love how charred he looks PogChamp
[3:10:23] <+XxTippoxX> he mad
[3:10:24] <%ThePuddingDead> so what kind of monster would birkin categorize as in D&D?
[3:10:26] <%MagickBurritoh> oh I'm confused
[3:10:27] <vampireinarm> so does the G-virus think the better it can see the harder it can kill you?
[3:10:28] <%ThePuddingDead> Flesh Golem?
[3:10:28] <dekkitout> orphan of kos -some say kosm- will lift birkin under a table
[3:10:31] <%JJCheeker> he's like the smelter demon
[3:10:32] <CrabSlacks> He an angry boi
[3:10:39] <MachigattaLT> @ThePuddingDead aboleth maybe?
[3:10:41] <%Laecerelius> Lay into him like you're shooting a Twin Grakatas!
[3:10:44] <+Toblo1> Birkin, yall need to CHILL
[3:10:44] <ShichiNoBushi> Aberration?
[3:10:45] <mr_ESB> Reeeee
[3:10:48] <%Kahnicus> Stop using your wing-hands Sasuke.
[3:10:50] <%RageKingDomo> hes like Goro
[3:10:54] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Sir! SIR!
[3:10:55] <%RageKingDomo> but actually cool
[3:10:56] <%DirtyGaijin> He needs his tendies
[3:10:59] <%MagickBurritoh> he's all crispy burnt now
[3:10:59] <%ThePuddingDead> I love this chat :3
[3:11:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nice
[3:11:00] <+valkuma> dickbuttwoman in the next stage you only really need the minigun and frag grenades. Minigun carefully on his eyes and then when he falls down, 2x frag grenade for quick kill
[3:11:00] <Geno4344> do you think Birkin would hate it if people called him Bill
[3:11:02] <+DestroyerPhoenix> sir this is a mcdonalds
[3:11:05] <+XxTippoxX> somebody want BBQ?
[3:11:06] <TriadOrion> "Look man, I'm going through a hell of a divorce right now, I'm working through some shit, can you blame me for being pissed?!"
[3:11:08] <KishinGrek> G virus is just pure instinct

[3:11:22] <gustavozxd> I just noticed but the rat on the first re2 trailer is actually in the gas staion of the intro
[3:11:22] <lloyddboy> NGL he looks fuckin tasty right now
[3:11:23] <TafferAA> just leave you dont even need that ammo

[3:11:25] <%MisterTylerrr> DIVORCED!
[3:11:26] <BurdRightsActivist> I want a Birkin stressball where if I squeeze it, it's little eyes poke out
[3:11:27] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Bik-B-Que
[3:11:27] <%ElenaManetta> I STILL can't tell if I would love this game or hate it. I love Evil Within 2, but the enemies staying dead is a crucial part of why I liked it.
[3:11:29] <%ThePuddingDead> We're....kindred spirits.....you and.......
[3:11:31] <Geno4344> also why doesn't Birkin go into his doggo form in this game
[3:11:32] <+dickbuttwoman> @valkuma Yeah, I figured the grenades out pretty quickly
[3:11:33] <%RageKingDomo> i like that burning him actually gives him a crispy look
[3:11:33] <kiryuuva> hes taking a nap, hes tired
[3:11:34] <HeadsHeldHigh> consume him to gain power
[3:11:36] <OkamiDude15> who would win? kiryu or final form birkin?
[3:11:37] <%RageKingDomo> such amazing detail
[3:11:37] <Jaxnos> if we eat birkin, will we grow eyes on the inside?
[3:11:40] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I could go for a BBQ party right about now

[3:11:53] <lloyddboy> @Bane_Kaikyo LUL
[3:11:58] <%ThePuddingDead> Kiryu with Majima tag team MAYBE would win
[3:11:59] <%DirtyGaijin> Is sherry the orphan of kos?
[3:12:00] <OkamiDude15> @kiryuuva shit you right woopsDab
[3:12:01] <ScreamingMeat> DansGame
[3:12:07] <vampireinarm> @OkamiDude15 does Kiryu have his glowing sexual Yakuza energy?
[3:12:08] <firearmsinstructor> I did this boss on a Minimalist / Frugalist / S rank run with regular 9mm ammo in the revolver. It was intense, but is possible. (Was *NOT* first try.) :)
[3:12:09] <%stolando_florida> @ElenaManetta enemies (that arent bosses) do stay dead though..
[3:12:15] <+valkuma> but yeah berkin is basically immune to fire LUL
[3:12:17] <jacknerik> Has pat played the HUNK bonus stuff on stream?
[3:12:17] <KishinGrek> Wtf
[3:12:17] <%ElenaManetta> But only if their head pops.
[3:12:19] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Blasphemy
[3:12:19] <ZephynM> Ammo for days.
[3:12:20] <Dakuu75> savage
[3:12:21] <%Zaramoth> ez game
[3:12:21] <Jaxnos> too much ammo, throw out more
[3:12:21] <CrezaK> Since he keeps coming back (over and over) wouldnt it make sense to like cover him in grenades to blow him to smithereens to be safe
[3:12:22] <$swiggityswooty4dabooty> Birkin has a doggo form?
[3:12:23] <DeanX27> @DirtyGaijin Nah, she's more like Gasgoigne's daughter
[3:12:23] <%RageKingDomo> Pat threw away ammo
[3:12:24] <mr_ESB> All those resources holy crap
[3:12:24] <%stolando_florida> @jacknerik yes
[3:12:26] <%RageKingDomo> what the fuck
[3:12:27] <that_owl_guy> All Birkin had to do to win was Lariat until Claire died
[3:12:28] <BurdRightsActivist> Weird Flex, but okay
[3:12:29] <+RushUnplugged> EMLO

[3:12:37] <OkamiDude15> @vampireinarm yes. as well as a 4 bottles of staminan royal
[3:12:38] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Discard with big disregard
[3:12:38] <Geno4344> @swiggityswooty4dabooty OG RE2 had Birkin go into another form in this fight
[3:12:45] <%Kahnicus> @jacknerik He did a Hunk run last thing last night
[3:12:46] <%heliosvaporizer> apatWink apatBlep
[3:12:46] <ZephynM> What difficulty is this by the way? I'd never have that much ammo
[3:12:50] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Emlo's looking our way
[3:12:50] <%Gogogolem> is claire wearing Pink hotpants?
[3:12:55] <%ThePuddingDead> all those acid rounds....
[3:12:57] <PSI_Guy95> I feel 72% more love towards this cat when I type his name as Emlo rather than Elmo
[3:12:57] <%DirtyGaijin> big standard
[3:12:59] <+Alig200> @ZephynM Standard
[3:12:59] <KishinGrek> There are children in Africa starving for ammo pat
[3:13:00] <Ion_LaserX> @ZephynM Standard
[3:13:02] <vampireinarm> @OkamiDude15 might as well not even do the fight then if its that one sided
[3:13:03] <+KragPlays> Standard af
[3:13:10] <ZephynM> :o Dang, he's crazy efficient.
[3:13:20] <ZephynM> Either that or I'm overzealous in my killing.
[3:13:25] <MachigattaLT> @KishinGrek BOSS. YOU KILLED A CHILD.
[3:13:27] <%DirtyGaijin> @KishinGrek dont worry those kids get the ammo one way or another
[3:13:28] <ZephynM> Probably both actually.
[3:13:29] <%ElenaManetta> Game is still going? WOW SLOW PAT.
[3:13:29] <reddeadwine1277> It seems like Birkin accepted that form in a way. Look at the way that he presented himself before attacking.
[3:13:30] <OkamiDude15> @vampireinarm about mad dog majima vs mr x
[3:13:38] <%stolando_florida> 29 mins is big possible
[3:13:39] <%Aitch971> Emlo is so pretty right now
[3:13:41] <%crimsonharvest> i believe in you nerd
[3:13:41] <+Yokuho> @AngriestPat You go get that ASS
[3:13:44] <%Gogogolem> Claire this is a zambie apocalypse wear some damn sleeves and a pants to cover your legs.
[3:13:45] <that_owl_guy> @zephynm dodging and knife are your friends
[3:13:47] <%walternatorz> Pat, you've always been good enough to beat the game.
[3:13:47] <NameNumber> Save some gatling for G5.
[3:13:48] <Guardiansaiyan> @reddeadwine1277 Birkin said Fuck It?
[3:13:49] <ZephynM> 29 minutes, definitely have time.
[3:13:49] <DeanX27> @MachigattaLT AMAZING, mission complete

[3:13:59] <Meekest> LUL
[3:14:00] <+Alig200> you've pretty much got it in the bag, Minigun + SMG on final Birkin = instawin
[3:14:02] <%valriot> speed
[3:14:04] <BurdRightsActivist> DON'T CARE.
[3:14:04] <MachigattaLT> @reddeadwine1277 birkin died some time after injecting G tbh, all thats left is survival and the need to implant his embryos
[3:14:04] <Geno4344> would elmo just sleep through the zombie apocalypse
[3:14:05] <%urban_hoof> @angriestpat... you gunna play another game after this or is,the stream over ?
[3:14:06] <ZephynM> @that_owl_guy Good to know! I'm quite Zealous in ripping and tearing though salHeh
[3:14:07] <vampireinarm> @OkamiDude15 might be a stalemate with how Mr. X likes to teleport around VS the Majima everywhere system
[3:14:08] <reddeadwine1277> @Guardiansaiyan I think so. The man was entirely consumed by that point.
[3:14:10] <RetributionP> Kiryu could beat up Mr x
[3:14:13] <Meekest> @AngriestPat Cutscenes don't add to in-game time
[3:14:15] <%Gogogolem> No rush that kid
[3:14:25] <%Kahnicus> We gotta get outta here before your bitch mother shows up Sweetie.
[3:14:28] <Ugato> could mr x beat jiren
[3:14:28] <%stolando_florida> there's no point of looking at the cutscenes for the 5th time though lol
[3:14:28] <%rdark_ksu> really need to use those child legs to book it Shirley
[3:14:30] <BigZam> Mr. Shakedown vs Mr. X; who wins
[3:14:33] <Meekest> Fair dues
[3:14:33] <%DirtyGaijin> Kiryu would stop the outbreak
[3:14:35] <%ElenaManetta> It's MIDNIGHT
[3:14:37] <CrabSlacks> the only emergency exit being an elevator is terrible design
[3:14:37] <%ElenaManetta> We're here for the long run
[3:14:38] <+EVOriginal> What's the closest thing we have to Mr. X in real life @AngriestPat
[3:14:40] <KishinGrek> Mr X is just Mr shakedown
[3:14:43] <ZephynM> I've beaten this game seven times over the week since it came out LUL
[3:14:44] <MachigattaLT> !uptime
[3:14:45] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 14m.
[3:14:47] <%Blankets_and_Tea> man, both claire and leon look fabulous in this remake
[3:14:48] <%ThePuddingDead> @BigZam which form of X? clothes or no clothes?
[3:14:49] <Meekest> But can you REALLY get tired of seeing Annette bite it
[3:14:51] <that_owl_guy> Skipping cutscenes is faster in real time, which is what matters
[3:14:52] <ZephynM> So now i"m trying to hardcore no save
[3:14:54] <chia233> sherry so cute OpieOP
[3:14:55] <OkamiDude15> @bigbradish depends which mr shakedown we're talking about
[3:14:56] <Geno4344> Mr. X could beat Mr. Shakedown because Mr. X has no money

[3:18:34] <ZephynM> Btw, anyone else notice in this game in Leon's route there are two voice lines that sound like they're from the PS1 version?
[3:18:36] <%ThePuddingDead> crazy talk?
[3:18:37] <%WackyGear> here comes berkin again
[3:18:38] <mr_ESB> Oh shiiiiit
[3:18:41] <%ElenaManetta> Do self destruct options actually exist? Like, does anyone use them? Do military jets have them or any shit?
[3:18:43] <reddeadwine1277> Claire is Evolving!
[3:18:43] <%AncelDeLambert> miniGUUUUUUUUN
[3:18:44] <Dreamedlint> This birkin fight is lit.
[3:18:51] <$waltzqueen> Time to kill your Dad!
[3:18:53] <reonome> LEON!
[3:18:53] <%Zaramoth> OK ALRIGHT
[3:18:53] <Guardiansaiyan> @reddeadwine1277 CLAIR-MON
[3:18:53] <ZephynM> "That explains the horrible things I've seen!" and "Holy shit!!!!!" sound like they were taken from the PS1 version.
[3:18:53] <+smargh1015> i cant believe the minigun is just sitting there
[3:18:54] <that_owl_guy> You don't even need all 400 to win. Closer to 250-320
[3:18:55] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@hadji087) (warning)
[3:18:55] <firearmsinstructor> I don't think a minigun is standard issue ordinance for a train operator... Barry Burton have a second job?
[3:18:55] <%MisterTylerrr> MINI GUN FOR BIG FUN
[3:18:57] <%HyperCharge_Sam> LEEEOOON
[3:19:00] <limeyprick> those other buttons do nothing lmao
[3:19:01] <%WackyGear> we got a real bad-ass over here
[3:19:04] <+dickbuttwoman> Because of YOU leon!
[3:19:05] <lionandfox21> This is probably the most badass thing in the entire game
[3:19:05] <%stolando_florida> @ElenaManetta yes
[3:19:07] <OwlLightningMage> @ElenaManetta This is a really good question LUL
[3:19:10] <+ButtStevens> what does the death scene look like for this boss
[3:19:11] <%AncelDeLambert> Leon, do you have the President's daughter?
[3:19:12] <Dao_Puppy> Leon really doesn't do anything in this game when you think about it.
[3:19:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Their voices don't even cut off. Only the video
[3:19:14] <Guardiansaiyan> @firearmsinstructor its his cousin Larry Burton
[3:19:20] <%dylin456> cdc has one
[3:19:22] <%Kahnicus> Well Sherry, look at it this way: Now you're an ORPHAN!
[3:19:22] <Guardiansaiyan> @AncelDeLambert LEON!
[3:19:24] <OkamiDude15> woopsD 📣 AYDUGH WEIGHT
[3:19:24] <Dreamedlint> aboot
[3:19:24] <lionandfox21> I think the CDC might actually have one due to all the pathogens
[3:19:27] <%hadji087> SKP PAT
[3:19:29] <%nofestu2> LEEEOON
[3:19:30] <firearmsinstructor> @Guardiansaiyan :D
[3:19:31] <KishinGrek> K bye
[3:19:32] <%Prism_Wing> iPhones have self destruct every year when new model come out
[3:19:33] <vampireinarm> a self destruct sounds real convenient if your lab is super illegal
[3:19:38] <%Gogogolem> It would make more sense for like a lockdown procedure considering they work with viruses.
[3:19:38] <Ugato> self destruct is pretty well represented in concept anyway. It's just "make everything that generates heat or could blow up do so as much as possible"
[3:19:38] <+Toblo1> MOMMAS HOME
[3:19:38] <reddeadwine1277> Your Claire has evolved into Big Dick Clarice!
[3:19:42] <mr_ESB> Its time
[3:19:45] <keksisblyat> GUN
[3:19:46] <%ElenaManetta> @Prism_Wing oh YOU
[3:19:46] <TriadOrion> A minigun?!
[3:19:48] <Dreamedlint> Daddy's here
[3:19:48] <OkamiDude15> THATS STUPID! I LOVE IT
[3:19:50] <ScreamingMeat> CDC Apparently has a self destruct
[3:19:50] <Finaldragoon> G U N
[3:19:50] <%NWR_James> he just said that cuz he really is looking for Ada
[3:19:50] <%HyperCharge_Sam> PogChamp
[3:19:51] <TafferAA> no place for the ammo LuL
[3:19:51] <BurdRightsActivist> I'm just gonna use this minigun that someone, you know, simply left here
[3:19:54] <CrabSlacks> Ol' Painless
[3:19:55] <CrezaK> During the Cold War the USSR and the USA both had like planetary self destruct buttons
[3:19:56] <%DirtyGaijin> Those samsungs had a self destruct
[3:19:57] <%MisterTylerrr> MINI GUN FOR BIG FUN
[3:19:57] <Dakuu75> lol
[3:20:00] <%Laecerelius> STAY AWAY FROM HER YoU BITCH!
[3:20:01] <%DirtyGaijin> you just couldnt choose when
[3:20:02] <%aishman> HE'S STILL ALIVE?!
[3:20:03] <%Zaramoth> The time has come, and so have I
[3:20:04] <%ThePuddingDead> WOAH
[3:20:05] <+Floorislava> the CDC has a self destruct
[3:20:08] <%WackyGear> and if the things inside could kill you
[3:20:08] <reonome> he has eyes for days
[3:20:09] <merrymsa> Normal people don't work in a place with a protocol for exploding the place to remove evidence
[3:20:09] <%ThePuddingDead> HE LOOKS GREAT!
[3:20:11] <dekkitout> he looks even COOLER
[3:20:13] <+RevolverOcelot16> She's got a got dang Minigun
[3:20:15] <that_owl_guy> Its more common for computers to have a self-destruct than an entire complex. Your entire building blowing up will draw tons of attention
[3:20:15] <PSI_Guy95> Birkin the Jerkin
[3:20:16] <%ThePuddingDead> I never saw this!
[3:20:20] <%chrishnaw> When do you unlock ray tracing in this game?
[3:20:21] <reddeadwine1277> Noooow he's only a beast
[3:20:22] <lloyddboy> BRRRRRRRRRRRT
[3:20:25] <Ugato> when did he change to bloodboorne
[3:20:25] <gustavozxd> don't you worry girly
[3:20:26] <+NeoTox> @AngriestPat Is the weather cold as hell around you too, pat?
[3:20:27] <+Andrizzleton> >eyes on the outside
[3:20:27] <Guardiansaiyan> GOD thats ugly...You can't care for Sherry like that Birkin!
[3:20:27] <+Spikyshrike> That's a lottta bones monkaS
[3:20:27] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Kreygasm It ain't over til the fat lady sings Kreygasm
[3:20:28] <ObsidianDragon86> Grant us eyes GRANT US EYES
[3:20:30] <%lewdskeletor13> Birkin you ass PunOko PunOko PunOko
[3:20:31] <Geno4344> oh, is this doggo form?
[3:20:31] <Ugato> is this is the party cave
[3:20:31] <%Prism_Wing> The G Virus is the asshole
[3:20:35] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Spare 15, you are cleared hot! Engage!
[3:20:35] <RekknLIVE> she looks pretty relaxed LUL
[3:20:36] <+verelme> Seven minutes until *I* take over!
[3:20:39] <PlumpPotatoRump> that minigun looks like it has zero kickback
[3:20:39] <actualemu> that look on her face
[3:20:40] <%General_Terro> g demands more eyes
[3:20:41] <+Vestillion> Can we talk about the unfeasibility of this? that gun would rip her arms off and go flying across the room.
[3:20:41] <zwilliams07> Claire ain't got time to bleed.
[3:20:47] <Guardiansaiyan> @Prism_Wing the final form looks like a litteral asshole
[3:20:47] <actualemu> its so effortless to carry that thing around and run from the zomboid
[3:20:48] <TheGr8ChefNick> He is an asshole. Give him a new one while you're at it
[3:20:48] <%Kahnicus> Thrill Kill Club.
[3:20:52] <PSI_Guy95> Looks liker her schedule just opened up
[3:20:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> brrrrrrt
[3:20:55] <%lesbianmimikyu> So if annette doesn't want her daughter to live in a world with the g-virus in it, why'd she fuckin' make the thing
[3:20:57] <%WackyGear> berkin looks like a weird Cthulhu monster
[3:20:59] <%ThePuddingDead> Grant us weakspots....grant us WEAKSPOTS
[3:21:00] <%DirtyGaijin> Claire is superhuman
[3:21:00] <+Spikyshrike> LUL Her fucking face
[3:21:01] <%AncelDeLambert> lol, the entire point of a rotating barrel is that it DOESN'T build heat like that
[3:21:01] <vampireinarm> Claire can carry that gun like it weighs nothing, whats her workout like
[3:21:02] <%ElenaManetta> Yeah?
[3:21:02] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Are those tracer rounds?
[3:21:06] <%ElenaManetta> Oh, he was talking to the game
[3:21:07] <+SpookyCarnage> @Vestillion Well if she doesn't use the gun then the thing she's fighting is gonna do the same to her
[3:21:07] <Ion_LaserX> That minigun will turn you into a SEXUAL TYRANNOSAURUS
[3:21:10] <%Toynota10> butt
[3:21:10] <$swiggityswooty4dabooty> In my opinion, this is the most grotesque G transformation in the game
[3:21:11] <BurdRightsActivist> Can I get my birkin stressball already?
[3:21:14] <limeyprick> 19 year old girl strength
[3:21:16] <merrymsa> Her brother punches boulders
[3:21:16] <gustavozxd> oh sorry about that babe
[3:21:19] <Ugato> that's what SHE SAID
[3:21:21] <merrymsa> With his bare hands
[3:21:21] <%AncelDeLambert> @Reizie_Etherealm it's a video game, they're ALWAYS tracer rounds
[3:21:22] <%DirtyGaijin> The GOO-Virus
[3:21:26] <that_owl_guy> @lesbianmimikyu William made G. Annette just made every other possible mistake, lol
[3:21:26] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Gamer Goo
[3:21:27] <%Kahnicus> @lesbianmimikyu It was ok when she lived in a lab with the G-Virus in it.
[3:21:29] <merrymsa> She can carry a minigun
[3:21:30] <%Zaramoth> He a GOOBOY
[3:21:31] <%lewdskeletor13> People wanting realism in an RE game LUL
[3:21:37] <KishinGrek> Bio-Goo
[3:21:37] <dekkitout> a few more transformations and im sure birkin will fill out juuuuuust right
[3:21:42] <HyperionXV> The funny thing is this form of Birken is super weak to hand grenades since they hit each of his eyes at once. Dies in like, 5 grenades.
[3:21:46] <AdmiralButtloaf> @AngriestPat Wouldn't this self destruct cause a city block to cave into it?
[3:21:47] <+stelfury> @vestillion giant mutant zombie fuck but let's concern ourselves with the unfeasability of the minigun LUL
[3:21:48] <TafferAA> TOP ROPE
[3:21:48] <+Reizie_Etherealm> @AncelDeLambert You've got a point lol
[3:21:50] <firearmsinstructor> *I believe I can fly!*
[3:21:51] <%ElenaManetta> What is HAPPENING when he slashes the air? Is he ripping open time dimensions?
[3:21:51] <KishinGrek> Bio-Curse
[3:21:53] <%stolando_florida> Miniguns typically use tracer rounds because they usually don't have sights lmao
[3:21:53] <Ugato> TOP ROPES YEAH
[3:21:54] <%DirtyGaijin> Put him back in the oven, he isnt dont yet
[3:21:55] <DeanX27> Ok that was the doppest
[3:21:55] <+dickbuttwoman> Grenades pat!
[3:21:55] <OkamiDude15> OFF THE STEEL CAGE woopsMB
[3:21:55] <ScreamingMeat> That looks goofy as shit
[3:22:07] <that_owl_guy> Huh, I never even tried to shoot him when he climbs the walls
[3:22:08] <Geno4344> MY CLIENT WILLIAM BIRKIN
[3:22:09] <kiryuuva> he sounds like a Pokémon
[3:22:12] <HeadsHeldHigh> Grant us EYES
[3:22:13] <Desertfishing> accuracy by volume
[3:22:15] <+RushUnplugged> would the G-virus ultimate form be just a giant mass of eyeballs?
[3:22:16] <limeyprick> where's your wife now dork?
[3:22:18] <+BorinCorran> Anyone remember that time in Furious 7 when The Rock picks up the minigun from a drone?
[3:22:20] <%AncelDeLambert> GET OFF MY TRAIN... thingy... platform.
[3:22:24] <%stolando_florida> Walk those bullets on target
[3:22:24] <%ThePuddingDead> swat dat butt
[3:22:28] <%urban_hoof> well the CDC has a explosive in their facility( not like the walking dead one) in contained areas so the dangerous viruses can't hurt the public .. tho personally not lettinga virus die out seems irresponsible...
[3:22:28] <TheGr8ChefNick> This man looks like a scarier hedorah
[3:22:33] <+Andrizzleton> imagine being this mad
[3:22:35] <Ion_LaserX> @BorinCorran That was awesome
[3:22:37] <gustavozxd> my amazement at how much better the Kendo gun store is in the remake will never stop
[3:22:38] <dekkitout> final forme is basically shuma gorath
[3:22:38] <Zambambino_> all those eyes but can burkin see why kids love cinnamon toast crunch
[3:22:38] <OwlLightningMage> Pat is out WutFace
[3:22:42] <curse85> that! when he jumps off the walls at you ITS AWESOME!!
[3:22:42] <%CerberusDriver> These hitboxes trho
[3:22:42] <%VeryTricky> how do you even dodge that
[3:22:43] <%DirtyGaijin> Shoot the Birkin
[3:22:44] <+Reizie_Etherealm> For a heavy gun, she sure can fly with it when she got hit
[3:22:45] <OwlLightningMage> Crazy Talk wins again WutFace
[3:22:52] <that_owl_guy> Another first; I have now seen somebody run out of minigun ammo during this fight
[3:22:57] <%ThePuddingDead> Ever been so mad you grew eyes on your stomach and bitch slapped a train?
[3:22:59] <eeejoy> he need the train
[3:23:02] <%DirtyGaijin> THE EYES
[3:23:05] <+BorinCorran> @that_owl_guy I also did that...
[3:23:08] <%stolando_florida> The M134 is 85 LBS
[3:23:08] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat are you sure you've done this before? rooKek
[3:23:11] <%Blankets_and_Tea> the many eyes confuse him
[3:23:12] <+Toblo1> @AngriestPat So do you prefer *this* version of G4 or classic?
[3:23:15] <reddeadwine1277> My BRAND!
[3:23:17] <DeanX27> @ThePuddingDead
[3:23:19] <reonome> he's taking aiming lessons from you pat
[3:23:20] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, you're shooting AT the eyes but not shooting the EYES
[3:23:20] <SiameseSneeze> Go for the eyes, Boo!
[3:23:21] <%Laecerelius> Is the grenade launcher even doing anything to him?
[3:23:22] <markdreizehn> Hey Pat, have you ever noticed that Birgin's rush attack is literally the Tigrex/Narga rush?
[3:23:24] <Ultimatefool> How big is this elevator?!?!
[3:23:26] <%Prism_Wing> Birkin needs ClearEyes
[3:23:27] <mr_ESB> Is this birkins doggo form?
[3:23:30] <limeyprick> Red Bull Vision
[3:23:31] <DeanX27> @ThePuddingDead That's Wednesdays for you
[3:23:31] <brambobelurkin> Pat..... after that magnum miss session... I dont think you got room to talk lol
[3:23:31] <%AncelDeLambert> make him splatter, Pat
[3:23:31] <MachigattaLT> gg
[3:23:32] <%DirtyGaijin> In with the power bomb
[3:23:36] <curse85> THAT IS FUCKIN COOL
[3:23:38] <person181> did we win?
[3:23:38] <+KragPlays> @thepuddingdead Yeah, all the time watching pat save scum
[3:23:39] <+Andrizzleton> it's not over yet!
[3:23:39] <%urban_hoof> @angriestpat. your question should be... how do i have AN ARM after one hit!?!
[3:23:40] <KishinGrek> Last stage
[3:23:41] <+rcand9> would you class this as his dog form pat?
[3:23:44] <%ThePuddingDead> @DeanX27 Eyyyyyyy
[3:23:45] <MachigattaLT> oh wait is this claire B
[3:23:45] <+Vestillion> Like, Claire could not lift that gun, let alone hold it steady when it fired.
[3:23:48] <vampireinarm> speaking of super illegal labs, how does something so big an elaborate as these labs get built without someone whos not in on it being like "Hol' on just a darn minute..."
[3:23:48] <MachigattaLT> does he know about g5
[3:23:49] <Ugato> awww he just wants to play
[3:23:51] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@jjjkopf) (warning)
[3:23:52] <+Skwizgarr> !uptime
[3:23:53] <actualemu> shlorp shlorp shlorp
[3:23:53] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 23m.
[3:23:54] <gustavozxd> is the suppressor useful at all?
[3:23:54] <firearmsinstructor> PAT don't let Birkin near Paige... he has "The Pink Eye" O_@
[3:23:55] <%AncelDeLambert> finally
[3:23:55] <%ElenaManetta> Pat mentioned the eye obsession, but he never mentioned the TEETH obsession Umbrella has.
[3:23:55] <that_owl_guy> I forget, does Pat have any frags left?
[3:23:58] <kiryuuva> Clap
[3:24:00] <KishinGrek> Bio-Goo
[3:24:04] <BurdRightsActivist> Birkin stressball
[3:24:04] <+dickbuttwoman> The 4 minute thing
[3:24:04] <MachigattaLT> HE DOESNT KNOW ABOUT G5?
[3:24:04] <%Laecerelius> Guess it is doing damage
[3:24:07] <%MisterTylerrr> I miss Doggo Birkin
[3:24:09] <reddeadwine1277> It's not a tuma!
[3:24:09] <+KragPlays> @that_owl_guy Like 5
[3:24:09] <ScreamingMeat> WutFace
[3:24:12] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @vampireinarm Buying off whoever's important
[3:24:15] <%AncelDeLambert> @gustavozxd well, it keeps your ears from bleeding, I supposed that's a plus
[3:24:15] <+dickbuttwoman> You need to hit his eyes enough
[3:24:15] <Guardiansaiyan> @ElenaManetta Umbrella doesn't have dental
[3:24:16] <KeiPrime> spark shot?
[3:24:16] <Djinnazz> MMini gun
[3:24:16] <MachigattaLT> oh man its super vore time
[3:24:17] <%stolando_florida> @gustavozxd enemies can't hear the silencer and it makes your gun more accurate
[3:24:17] <TafferAA> shot him
[3:24:18] <%Zaramoth> now crawl inside for warmth
[3:24:19] <+Toblo1> @AngriestPat So do you like this version of G4 or classic still?
[3:24:21] <Ultimatefool> Minigun spam
[3:24:22] <+Andrizzleton> have to shoot the eyes
[3:24:24] <HyperionXV> Easy way to knock him off the wall is hand grenade right as he starts
[3:24:25] <%ElenaManetta> LOOK at ELMO
[3:24:27] <firearmsinstructor> You have to back up to the other side of the train to get the angle... OR stand beside the wall and unload before he gets too high.
[3:24:27] <%chrishnaw> They were all vestigial eyeballs
[3:24:29] <+Yokuho> With mouse and keyboard
[3:24:32] <Guardiansaiyan> @Zaramoth not enough room for everyone
[3:24:33] <+Alig200> hit his eyes as he climbs up, easiest with minigun @AngriestPat
[3:24:35] <Cherokia666> I shot him off once, but it was with the minigun, spamming
[3:24:37] <Fatman2124> !uptime
[3:24:37] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 24m.
[3:24:38] <merrymsa> I just had to shoot your dad a billion times
[3:24:38] <kiryuuva> wait, do cutscenes use in-game time?
[3:24:42] <%cerazor01> I perfer the original version of G4
[3:24:47] <%ThePuddingDead> this game's great
[3:24:48] <DeanX27> @kiryuuva Nope
[3:24:48] <%Agami23> that phase of birkin looks ALOT like the last phase of nemesis
[3:24:52] <Ugato> apparently not @kiryuuva
[3:24:54] <kiryuuva> @DeanX27 nice
[3:25:01] <firearmsinstructor> Hand grenade might work, too. Grenade launcher doesn't help here. Popping eyeballs is what matters.
[3:25:02] <that_owl_guy> I enjoy this version
[3:25:04] <$swiggityswooty4dabooty> Well hold your horses baby cause G5 is on the way
[3:25:05] <MachigattaLT> does he even have enough ammo for this
[3:25:07] <%Kahnicus> If I knew more about rap I'd make a G6 joke here.
[3:25:07] <mr_ESB> Inb4 teeth WutFace
[3:25:08] <%dylin456> cant wait for re3 remake now
[3:25:10] <%Toynota10> we getting some tofu after this?
[3:25:10] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Why that scene with her blank stare
[3:25:10] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat It looks goofy as shit when Berkin drops down on to the platform
[3:25:11] <curse85> Can you shoot him when hes flying at you? maybe it knocks him back IMUST TRY THIS
[3:25:13] <firearmsinstructor> Minigun / MQ11 work best
[3:25:13] <MachigattaLT> inb4 vore
[3:25:13] <%chrishnaw> They were vestigial eyeballs all along
[3:25:15] <BurdRightsActivist> G it sure is boring around here
[3:25:16] <Trillex56> @AngriestPat do tofu mode after this
[3:25:19] <%Laecerelius> A G5 with LOTS OF MONEY!!
[3:25:20] <%ElenaManetta> EW
[3:25:23] <HyperionXV> Hand grenades are just absurdely strong against G4
[3:25:24] <%ElenaManetta> Like pimples?
[3:25:25] <%DirtyGaijin> G4 in this game makes me think of the large Dead space enemies
[3:25:25] <$waltzqueen> TOFU!
[3:25:26] <$birchpeninsula> How does birkin get so HUGE so quickly?
[3:25:26] <Trillex56> @AngriestPat or hunk
[3:25:29] <%stolando_florida> Direct hits with the grenade launcher to an eyeball still does a lot of damage.
[3:25:31] <reddeadwine1277> look at dem tatters
[3:25:31] <retrokid616> OWLgetonpoint
[3:25:33] <%Toynota10> @AngriestPat We getting some tofu after this?
[3:25:39] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Creepy

[3:25:50] <%Kahnicus> Sherry: I would like not to be homeless
[3:25:55] <%harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt> Is birkin what happens when pat cuts his moles off?
[3:25:56] <merrymsa> Claire did not convince her parents to adopt Sherry
[3:25:56] <%urban_hoof> that little girl is creepy
[3:25:57] <%maskedriderhero> Millions of people are dead Claire

[3:25:58] <suikudo> She visited her but thats about it
[3:25:58] <+Shastafield> fancy new family
[3:25:59] <+Andrizzleton> i like how cutscenes do NOT count against your playtime
[3:26:00] <jacknerik> Wait where is Ada right now?
[3:26:02] <MachigattaLT> @stolando_florida tested, g5 isnt able to be cleared on HC with direct hits using both types of grenade rounds
[3:26:02] <bigbradish> Claire going to shower with Leon

[3:26:04] <%CerberusDriver> classic leon outfit
[3:26:05] <+chrimbooooo> ok.

[3:26:06] <ScreamingMeat> Uncle Sam adopted her
[3:26:06] <+ButtStevens> o k
[3:26:07] <%Laecerelius> DA GUBMENT
[3:26:07] <that_owl_guy> Didn't Sherry become a big ol experiment for the gov?
[3:26:08] <%kiiiirsten> ok
[3:26:08] <Sorasan22> ok
[3:26:08] <%ElenaManetta> What's with survival horror adults just ready to adopt strange children they barely know?
[3:26:08] <+Toblo1> G5 TIME!
[3:26:08] <Manjove> Claire smiling right there looks AWEFUL
[3:26:09] <%NWR_James> Claire was THIRSTY with that "You did"
[3:26:09] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> o k
[3:26:09] <HeadsHeldHigh> Ok
[3:26:09] <%Ciglossonjr> O K
[3:26:09] <eeejoy> re3 needs release in 2019
[3:26:10] <+Nekromatik> WutFace
[3:26:10] <+Yokuho> Well, with this new timeline anything is possible
[3:26:10] <%ThePuddingDead> odd reaction to meeting a girl
[3:26:13] <%ThePuddingDead> Ok.
[3:26:13] <%Zaramoth> This is a child i found and is mine now.
[3:26:16] <天使42199> VAGINE MONSTER
[3:26:16] <%rdark_ksu> I decided on naming her Sherry because I have a drinking problem
[3:26:17] <mr_ESB> Sherry in re6?
[3:26:18] <reonome> OK
[3:26:18] <Meekest> Why don't they both go?
[3:26:18] <%Zaramoth> Dont worry about it
[3:26:19] <+Reizie_Etherealm> NESS?!
[3:26:19] <%Agami23> man, i miss leon going "it worked!"
[3:26:20] <gustavozxd> Sherry isn't a cute anime girl so people gonna complain obviously LUL
[3:26:20] <$swiggityswooty4dabooty> Aaaaaand G5
[3:26:20] <%joylent_blue> "OK" LUL
[3:26:21] <merrymsa> and so Sherry kept the name of the man who killed everyone in Raccoon City
[3:26:21] <reddeadwine1277> I own this!
[3:26:21] <FeedbacK7777> @AngriestPat think they're gonna soft-reboot the series? Anette said sherry doesn't have any virus on her anymore.
[3:26:22] <OwlLightningMage> It's weird how fast Sherry gets over the death of her old busted parents for hot new parents LUL
[3:26:22] <hlreiku> vageen
[3:26:22] <%DirtyGaijin> time for the big goo
[3:26:23] <%cerazor01> That minigun on her back tho
[3:26:23] <HyperionXV> G5 is just invincible besides the giant eyeball, but can be killed with whatever if you hit the weakspot
[3:26:24] <%bendatron> they can always retcon as re likes doing
[3:26:26] <Dakuu75> for real?! so sherry is like "will you two adopt me?" and leon and Clair are BOTH like "fuck that noise!"? lol
[3:26:28] <MachigattaLT> @stolando_florida meanwhile both pistols are able to clear it
[3:26:28] <%cerazor01> It's yuge!

[3:26:40] <OkamiDude15> aw man i love teeth
[3:26:41] <ospreyworks> Love how Claire is immaculate, but they left in the "ew I'm gross" comment.
[3:26:42] <%ThePuddingDead> persistent batch!
[3:26:42] <%stolando_florida> @MachigattaLT oic in previous versions of him direct hits do damage, weird of them to change the rules around

[3:26:48] <DrMoose7> this is fine
[3:26:50] <lionandfox21> Who knows, it'll probably be retconned in a few years due to all the remakes
[3:26:50] <%Shady_Zaku> WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT

[3:27:05] <+Vestillion> Oh hey, dead space.
[3:27:07] <+Vestillion> Good times.
[3:27:08] <%ElenaManetta> This design is way cooler than the black goo in RE7 final boss.
[3:27:09] <Mr_Gunny> Ewww
[3:27:12] <+Toblo1> Look at all that MEAT
[3:27:12] <MidnightSnack69> he became a giant demon butthole

[3:27:18] <%aishman> I love how the entire car is becoming meaty

[3:27:28] <+KragPlays> @geno4344 What vaginas have you seen that look like this
[3:27:28] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> You're making shit up, Claire
[3:27:28] <%VeryTricky> da DPS
[3:27:29] <firearmsinstructor> PAT use THE LOCKER!!
[3:27:30] <%CerberusDriver> this is the thing
[3:27:31] <mr_ESB> Ggs
[3:27:32] <%Zaramoth> an Eyeball inside your mouth seems like it would make things difficult
[3:27:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wew
[3:27:34] <+Walopoh> "I specifically want to eat you"
[3:27:34] <%ElenaManetta> Is it converting the train?
[3:27:38] <+ButtStevens> hey its that dog
[3:27:38] <%chrishnaw> Leon, halp
[3:27:40] <limeyprick> do all resident evil ghouls eventually turn into biggo eye flesh monsters?
[3:27:42] <%DirtyGaijin> Birking you stupid bitch!
[3:27:46] <reddeadwine1277> @ElenaManetta Seems to be
[3:27:47] <Desertfishing> looks like a gwar creation
[3:27:47] <%ElenaManetta> Did it fuse with the train or something? What the fuck
[3:27:50] <lionandfox21> I like the detail that his eye is still blue even though he's been through so many transformations
[3:27:50] <%Laecerelius> NO TICKET!
[3:27:52] <%Kahnicus> I mean, at some point he's got to think "maybe blatantly showing my weakpoint is a failing strategy."
[3:27:53] <MachigattaLT> tfw no vore jokes 😔
[3:27:55] <%ElenaManetta> It can just fuse with anything? Even inorganic material?
[3:27:55] <vampireinarm> thats not how fire works
[3:27:55] <reddeadwine1277> Good thing RC gets nuked
[3:27:57] <TafferAA> @limeyprick no just G infected creatures
[3:27:58] <KeiPrime> nah some become bone monsters, like that fuckin guy in RE6
[3:28:02] <+Toblo1> @limeyprick I'd say at least 75% of them
[3:28:03] <RCtiger0> That big eye is staring at her really hard
[3:28:04] <+Trimoon333> crab monsters
[3:28:06] <yosukecchi> ewww
[3:28:06] <curse85> All i had for this fight was handgun bullets and won so i think the game helps you or some shit i killed him with like 28 handgun bullets
[3:28:07] <KeiPrime> or giant bugs like that guy in RE6
[3:28:07] <ScreamingMeat> G6 is just straight up a Necromorph
[3:28:08] <+Andrizzleton> the eye dilation i clapped when I saw it
[3:28:09] <%WackyGear> the puss ew
[3:28:10] <mr_ESB> Mah eye
[3:28:10] <天使42199> 🦀 monsters
[3:28:11] <%chrishnaw> Mmmmm, eyeball juice
[3:28:12] <%Rngiddion> some get electric tits
[3:28:12] <AdmiralButtloaf> It makes alot less sense for Leon not to help in Claire B
[3:28:12] <+BorinCorran> Just like Chris says "Punching boulders is a good activity for family bonding"
[3:28:13] <DeanX27> They turn to bugs too. Dinosaurs
[3:28:13] <dekkitout> its leaking mustard
[3:28:14] <merrymsa> some of the turn into giant Napoleon
[3:28:15] <Ugato> biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiig goo

[3:28:15] <Desertfishing> YA PISS JUICE
[3:28:16] <reddeadwine1277> Does this count as pegging?
[3:28:17] <MachigattaLT> or the matrix @wesker
[3:28:17] <%DirtyGaijin> Or giant enemy crabs
[3:28:17] <+Gooniekorn> jack turned into a eyeball monster
[3:28:17] <LucidInDarkness> Dinosaurs
[3:28:18] <%TheShal> Sadler turned into a crab monster.
[3:28:18] <HeadsHeldHigh> penetrated
[3:28:19] <+chrimbooooo> or like a t rex
[3:28:19] <OkamiDude15> she got that gross eye goop all over WutFace
[3:28:19] <jacknerik> mariaScary
[3:28:20] <Brandon__Brando> I love how the solution to everything in Resident evil is to shoot it
[3:28:21] <that_owl_guy> That one dude became a giant T-Rex, and then a giant fly
[3:28:21] <+Trimoon333> knife arms
[3:28:21] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Don't talk about RE0
[3:28:21] <gustavozxd> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[3:28:21] <%Laecerelius> There's Pagie's ultimate form!
[3:28:24] <$spacehouse> or DINOSAUR
[3:28:24] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> or RE6
[3:28:24] <+dickbuttwoman> A fly
[3:28:27] <+Reizie_Etherealm> There's even a giant fly at one point
[3:28:27] <+SuperiorDelta> Wtf does his giant eye in his mouth have its own mouth in the middle
[3:28:28] <Nova712> Between Birkin, Ouroboros and Evelyn... Yes
[3:28:28] <%ThePuddingDead> Some of them turn into new people like children and actually WIN like Alex Weskerrr....
[3:28:28] <%Laecerelius> WHO'S STABBING?!
[3:28:28] <dekkitout> WAlT A T-REX?!?
[3:28:29] <%NWR_James> I WANT A T-REX VIRUS
[3:28:29] <thedukeofwolves> Mothra
[3:28:29] <TwentyCXII> Why was a rusty pole 100% more effective than a million bullets???
[3:28:30] <mr_ESB> Re6 t rex lol
[3:28:31] <Cherokia666> It Worked!
[3:28:31] <%ElenaManetta> We killed the zombie train, guys!
[3:28:34] <+Rolandknight> giant FACES
[3:28:35] <+zaworldo> @AngriestPat NOTHER HUNK RUN
[3:28:35] <%RageKingDomo> man the cell division required to turn into a big goo eyeball monster is crazy high
[3:28:35] <digimonda> RE0 was fine
[3:28:36] <+ButtStevens> oh god i forgot about the trex WHY
[3:28:36] <dekkitout> gimme g-virus NOW
[3:28:38] <reonome> YOU DO IT
[3:28:39] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> We don't talk about Re6
[3:28:40] <KeiPrime> eyeballs tend to be a G virus thing
[3:28:40] <+Vestillion> I miss good dead space.
[3:28:42] <CommanderCOOL> new parents time!!!
[3:28:43] <Dakuu75> yeah because the virus's internal genetic code is like "Ya'know what this organism needs... like 50 more eyes... and extra arms."
[3:28:44] <JonKhan> The T-rex was ridiculous
[3:28:44] <Geno4344> Remember the t-G virus and how its user turned into a girl tyrant Kappa
[3:28:45] <%President_Miyazaki> But T-rex then turns into big buy with giant glowing eyes as weak points.
[3:28:45] <Scruffy_Neckbeard> Yeah, Suplex that Zombie Train
[3:28:45] <+BorinCorran> He turned into a T-Rex and also a Tiger or some shit if I remember.
[3:28:46] <+Yokuho> Tofu time
[3:28:47] <%rdark_ksu> sometimes a weird tentacle thing connected to a vagina mouth. shits weird
[3:28:48] <%ElenaManetta> So BRIGHT
[3:28:51] <OwlLightningMage> Sherry has got how new parents now LUL
[3:28:52] <vampireinarm> ok but what if you put the G-virus into an ACTUAL T-rex
[3:28:53] <$swiggityswooty4dabooty> Is it only the G-Virus and any other G-Virus like strain that gives them those eyes?
[3:28:53] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat is berkin super dead?
[3:28:53] <+Arbal3st> And then Wesker is just stuffed full of all the viruses
[3:28:54] <hlreiku> All employees board the emergency evacuation transport
[3:28:55] <jacknerik> YES
[3:28:56] <yosukecchi> big pointy thing better than so many small things
[3:28:56] <firearmsinstructor> Claire *stabs sharp metal pole into Birkin's eyeball "You like that!?" Birkin: "Yes. This is specifically my fetish."
[3:28:56] <OkamiDude15> @ElenaManetta but we didnt suplex it so is it really a win? woopsThink
[3:28:58] <%3xgilly> apatDab
