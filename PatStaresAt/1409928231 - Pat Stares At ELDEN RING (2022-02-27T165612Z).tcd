[0:43:18] <%cade_calrayn> I'm gonna wall-hug the swamp to find the way up
[0:43:19] <%topendbuzza> nothing
[0:43:19] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Salt water fresh water
[0:43:19] <Parapattern> Type of vegitation
[0:43:21] <Sunstalker> Plants in it, I bet
[0:43:22] <NeroInfinite> Salt or fresh water usually
[0:43:22] <+disgruntledgruntle> bog?
[0:43:24] <%JohnAtDawn> Amount of water and wildlife
[0:43:25] <%Treuan> One is short for Marsha
[0:43:25] <%TheAdMerlin> Swap is sitting water, marsh has a river
[0:43:26] <rommlll> marsh is slimier
[0:43:26] <%Axellogic> I die mostly to falls and stutters, theres that one time my horse murdered me when I summoned it
[0:43:32] <%Kevlar_Caviar> marsh is salt
[0:43:33] <+Solid__Guts> is the sound fucking up just for me ?
[0:43:35] <%Puhff> Yep
[0:43:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> what about a fen
[0:43:40] <digaogrunge> salt water
[0:43:40] <axelkaspar> A bog is alkaline
[0:43:41] <it_came_from_outer_space> what about bogs tho
[0:43:41] <popecrispy> Is it worth picking up this game if it’s my first souls game
[0:43:42] <%weissguard> A marsh is a wetland that is dominated by herbaceous rather than woody plant species.
[0:43:43] <outsidedoubtside> I think marshes are actually brackish water
[0:43:44] <mrcelab> Is it me, or Your mic does weird stuff when you are in the loading screen? like Your voice sounds weird.
[0:43:44] <Maids4lyfe> marsh is salty
[0:43:45] <MaritimeSpanker> lously smarsh
[0:43:45] <xxHungryxx> When is Fromsoft just going to add a Slow Fall spell?
[0:43:46] <%Bluwizard21> coulda sworn marsh was saltwater swamp
[0:43:47] <%solracc25> vegetation
[0:43:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> wetlands?
[0:43:50] <%cade_calrayn> @Rbeatononefour at the Purified Ruins? It was in the underground chest
[0:43:55] <NashvilleSBA> i always thought of it like soup versus stew
[0:44:03] <%solracc25> yup
[0:44:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeyeye rock arch
[0:44:14] <%solracc25> sitting vs moving
[0:44:18] <TomahawkSandwich> swamps are also forested. marshes more grasslands
[0:44:23] <NeroInfinite> big poison
[0:44:23] <TomahawkSandwich> huuuuurrrrrnerd
[0:44:28] <luciluxlu0> poison doesn't affect horse
[0:44:30] <NeroInfinite> crab
[0:44:36] <scrumbotime> ..... why didn't i think about using my horse on swamp
[0:44:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> don't get out of your car, lock the doors

[1:12:46] <G_476> ...they fell to their death, huh
[1:12:52] <MaritimeSpanker> I appreciate them not tying spell slots to a stat
[1:12:56] <Goergorion> did they jump?
[1:13:04] <Frostofthecwsw> pat, did you find the 3 wise creatures ever?
[1:13:04] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Cool

[1:13:09] <silentblast93> how did the die?
[1:13:21] <%MelBrooksKA> Jump or poison I guess
[1:13:29] <ape_hawk> since you like it, plague must HATE it
[1:13:37] <MaritimeSpanker> @PatStaresAt did you try out the tail spell?
[1:13:40] <Aussie_Manny> How many spells can you have on you at once?
[1:13:40] <TrollKing96> How is Elden Ring on PS4?
[1:13:42] <toulon_somberjade> as I found out, on the map when you don't have a map of an area you're in those stone mounment icons on it show where the map is
[1:13:52] <+wizard_of_diamonds> WAIT THOSE INCREASE SPELL SLOTS
[1:13:53] <ape_hawk> @TrollKing96 surprisingly great
[1:14:07] <%MelBrooksKA> It'll probably take a week to upload
[1:14:08] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Man that's cool. The whole time I never figured hat out
[1:14:10] <+SaintSalted> probably takes him like 3 days to upload tbh its a bummer
[1:14:13] <Parapattern> Really? I'm shocked.
[1:14:15] <+DrMcCannonfodder> this guy looks pretty nito!
[1:14:16] <silentblast93> btw pat ho is that faith bow that you found?
[1:14:17] <jubejube56> damn he went in
[1:14:17] <%tusk102> @TrollKing96 completely fine
[1:14:18] <Sunstalker> runs fine, just distant enemies got slightly worse framerate cuz openworld
[1:14:20] <%Deft_Thought> Why so many pots
[1:14:30] <%VictorVonLouche> PS4 is great just slightly longer load times
[1:14:33] <ape_hawk> ps4 has lesser quality lighting and longer load times but still looks amazing and runs great
[1:14:39] <+xcompleasedad> Are you fighting a baby Gaia?
[1:14:43] <%solracc25> our boy
[1:14:43] <%tusk102> As someone playing on ps4, game runs just fine just loads a bit slower
[1:14:45] <MaritimeSpanker> holy shit, that dablage
[1:14:47] <+SaintSalted> eli's internet career is legit held back by where he lives
[1:14:50] <luciluxlu0> catch flame works amazing for these tree bosses
[1:14:52] <%OrangeMDT> @trollking96 30 fps mostly. Enemies drop frames when there are a lot of them, but there aren’t Bloodborne load times at least

[1:16:40] <%GalacticaPhanto> I'm getting frustrated at this game, I've been exploring and I haven't found any armor, or weapons, so I'm still rocking default greatsword and default armorn
[1:16:41] <silentblast93> i think thats a falsk item
[1:16:43] <ape_hawk> lucario is in this game?
[1:16:57] <%Bloomingzonda> I got Elden Ring downloaded and its almost stutter free thanks to the tips I got off reddit and some things I figured out. Not that it is acceptable to have to use a guide to get a new game working
[1:16:58] <razieltano123> @PatStaresAt Tunnel to get up there?
[1:17:01] <rommlll> home of lucathiel
[1:17:07] <G_476> there's probably a warp gate or something, right

[1:17:17] <Sielas> Can anyone confirm if PC port is hot trash as people seem to be claiming?
[1:17:36] <%topendbuzza> it can be yes
[1:17:47] <silentblast93> this fosnt relly feel like gorge rr maratin did any writing
[1:17:49] <%X2Eliah> the stuttering is there, but varies from pc to pc. some ppl have it bad, some its not so bad.
[1:17:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's far from unplayable though
[1:17:50] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @Sielas it's not unplayable, at least for me, but yeah it can get pretty bad at times
[1:17:50] <%Wallabri> Wallabri subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 44 months! psaDogchamp
[1:17:55] <+RedMaskBandit> I'm playing on ps4 rn and it's fine
[1:17:55] <Saltmeisterr> Wait pat
[1:17:56] <pi_in_the_sci> I played the PC port for 3 hours, have 3 crashes
[1:17:57] <BreakfastSampler> there's some load stuttering in the first 30 minutes of play but otherwise fine
[1:17:59] <Aussie_Manny> Yeah, Paige was having some bad stuttering occasionally on her stream.
[1:18:01] <Saltmeisterr> there was pillar
[1:18:01] <@SSaryn> It's been improved a bit, but if you're looking for a proper way to play, PS4 on PS5 or Xbox Series X with VRS.
[1:18:04] <ianabstract> PC port stutters because it is compliling shaders as they get called instead of on startup
[1:18:06] <%grey_frank> Thank you so much AnAnonymousGifter
[1:18:08] <%LorcaNomad> pat's goliath of a PC with a 3080 can hardly run it at 60fps yeah
[1:18:12] <%cade_calrayn> Maybe there's a portal like there was to get to the Academy entrance, Pat
[1:18:12] <%Pappajimbo> mines ok but my brothers version stutters at the bosses
[1:18:14] <mrtanaka111> can i run elden ring with 8ram?
[1:18:21] <%Axellogic> @Sielas it runs well until it hits shader cache and stutters for like 5 seconds
[1:18:23] <+Beetlewins> yeah pc version is a crapshoot, fine for some, garbage for others
[1:18:28] <Chaos_Aether> What was that?
[1:18:31] <BreakfastSampler> I just framelock it to 30 and don't notice the stutters
[1:18:36] <+Missinglink91> Im really thinking about restarting my game
[1:18:43] <BreakfastSampler> except for the big ones
[1:18:45] <+Missinglink91> I kinda ruined my build and dont want to have to wait to respec
[1:18:48] <fatalDestiny> I turned most of the setting down to medium, and the stuttering is still there as things load, but it's playable outside of that, though still only about 45 FPS avg in the open world,
[1:18:54] <%Bloomingzonda> I got rid of the stuttering by making the Nvidia shader cahce size unlimited, Disabling a software device in windows for midi controllers and old printers, and using Nvidia antialiasing intead of the games option
[1:18:58] <+Beetlewins> setting your shader cache size to unlimited in NVIDIA control panel/equivalent AMD helps as well
[1:19:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> cool cool cool
[1:19:04] <%LorcaNomad> why tho
[1:19:06] <%Kevlar_Caviar> wow, how useful
[1:19:11] <toulon_somberjade> How far is pat Great Runes wise?

[1:19:13] <G_476> explode yourself for BIG DAMAGE, probably

[1:48:44] <ape_hawk> pat, you know how ive been joking that youre a full-on death knight?
[1:48:46] <%Brassnarwhal> I was just in the bestial sanctum and when it switched to night i heard a roar and i turned around and the guy you give the death root to is gone
[1:48:52] <ape_hawk> well, NOW youre a full on death knight
[1:48:59] <%greasypete00> wait did edgelord attack you?
[1:49:05] <%cade_calrayn> that's weird, I can't get the invasion to happen and I'm around the same part as you
[1:49:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> no fuckin around
[1:49:07] <MaritimeSpanker> literally summoning spirits of the dead
[1:49:10] <%cade_calrayn> THE FORBIDDEN TOOT

[1:49:13] <TechnocoloredCat> they stronk now

[1:49:19] <Aussie_Manny> khadDoot
[1:49:22] <MaritimeSpanker> yeah, that's a death knight alright
[1:49:30] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt When at low HP.
[1:49:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think it's just really slow
[1:49:31] <Bearheart223> IT heals you after you get hit
[1:49:34] <NiuenSaien> yellow life it looked like
[1:49:35] <+tylerpyre> is this still his first playthrough?
[1:49:37] <Bearheart223> I.E Recovers a portion of yellow health
[1:49:51] <MaritimeSpanker> Pat is almost a Lord Soth
[1:49:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh wait, when your HP gets reduced it heals you
[1:49:51] <KasiCrafter> It seems to be REAL slow
[1:49:51] <%solracc25> a bit as you get hurt
[1:49:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> I get it
[1:49:54] <luciluxlu0> only at halve health it said
[1:49:56] <NiuenSaien> it was tiny
[1:49:57] <+badhaye> yellow health recovered
[1:50:00] <+tylerpyre> Idk how fast people are finishing this game.
[1:50:01] <%bundle_of_herbs> that was no longer low hp by game standards
[1:50:04] <Bearheart223> Immediately after getting hity
[1:50:06] <%tusk102> weird
[1:50:08] <haitakaa> aka piss health
[1:50:13] <KasiCrafter> I guess the full set is what makes it viable?
[1:50:16] <Aussie_Manny> I never use "When at low HP" abilities in video games. Ever. Like, why would I WANT to be at low HP??
[1:50:22] <+Akizea> @tylerpyre I don't think there's a single person whis beaten the game yet tbh
[1:50:24] <MaritimeSpanker> oh wait
[1:50:24] <%tusk102> huh?
[1:50:27] <MaritimeSpanker> it juts a little bit
[1:50:30] <SummonerMagno> i saw it tick when you were under 25%
[1:50:30] <ARDM112> It did just now
[1:50:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> i saw it
[1:50:35] <%X2Eliah> oh that sucks
[1:50:36] <PettyFunk> Is it the Bloodborne mechanic maybe?
[1:50:37] <haitakaa> useless LUL
[1:50:39] <Meekest> Oh so its useless
[1:50:39] <+alphonseisbest> at 10%
[1:50:39] <ape_hawk> so its useless
[1:50:44] <Aussie_Manny> Oh, it healed you a pip.
[1:50:44] <%PartyFavors> oh boo
[1:50:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> magic pixel armor
[1:50:44] <Hepathos87> thats not that poggers
[1:50:46] <%tusk102> weird
[1:50:47] <stormhawk9891> Seems a bit weak
[1:50:49] <zanzibarian_hamster> BAD
[1:50:50] <ARDM112> With your healthbar it's pointless
[1:50:50] <Sigma_190_Beta> So useless.
[1:50:52] <NewWillinium> Not great regen
[1:50:52] <Bearheart223> oh yeah, that would be a better explanation
[1:50:55] <MaritimeSpanker> it do be styling
[1:50:56] <%solracc25> 15% ish?
[1:50:58] <Sunstalker> Or for red tear aquivalent?
[1:51:06] <jbrachob> still looks rad as fuck
[1:51:10] <+alphonseisbest> ok
[1:51:10] <%tusk102> its too cool not to wear
[1:51:10] <%Deft_Thought> Armor cool
[1:51:12] <T_Sasquatch> F A S H I O N
[1:51:13] <%Dakuu75> that's fair.
[1:51:14] <+alphonseisbest> baka
[1:51:14] <%bundle_of_herbs> boooo
[1:51:16] <+tylerpyre> @Akizea That makes sense. Some people are fast though 🤷🏾♂️
[1:51:18] <NiuenSaien> with a large life pool it would be pretty good if it is percentage based
[1:51:20] <%solracc25> skeleton man
[1:51:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> you gotta
[1:51:21] <haitakaa> 2 kewl
[1:51:24] <ALazo> pat why are you a skeleton
[1:51:26] <%bundle_of_herbs> dog was superior
[1:51:31] <ConflagrationsGaming> So, not sure if it's anyone else too, but I've refreshed the stream and it still sounds weird/distorted, but it feels more like a twitch thing more than pat's stream thing?
[1:51:32] <Aussie_Manny> haha
[1:51:32] <ConflagrationsGaming> am i wrong?
[1:51:33] <megaman_sentinel> I agree fashion over function
[1:51:34] <%Bloomingzonda> Put the dog head on with the skeleman set
[1:51:35] <C1ic> does it get a cloak if you adjust garment at a sight of grace
[1:51:39] <mrcelab> healing symbol started when you stopped moving
[1:51:41] <%Frostofthecwsw> did pat go into the academy yet?
[1:51:44] <Aussie_Manny> Leoric the Skeleton King.
[1:51:47] <+alphonseisbest> YEA GET THAT MAP USSY THAT MUSSY
[1:51:49] <%whyskeywolfe> This game is like an Alan Lee painting, holy fuck
[1:51:53] <%NotVeryLegendary> So... is bleed just really strong in this game?
[1:51:57] <jubejube56> Woulda been nice if Mr all knowing could like...mark the map
[1:52:04] <%tusk102> hmmmm
[1:52:07] <%bundle_of_herbs> @ConflagrationsGaming try turning off low latency mode
[1:52:21] <+badhaye> bleed is great
[1:52:26] <%cade_calrayn> huh
[1:52:28] <%Dakuu75> yeah but, when he was standing there taking the hits it wasn't procing. it has to be % based
[1:52:33] <%greasypete00> did he find rogier in the roundtable hold?
[1:52:37] <MaritimeSpanker> is the wolf dude there?
[1:52:38] <+alphonseisbest> oh Iron mans home
[1:52:39] <%cade_calrayn> Pat, you never went back to Irina after Castle Morne, did you?
[1:52:44] <%cade_calrayn> If you didn't, go now
[1:52:46] <MaritimeSpanker> because he was a revenger or whatnot
[1:53:02] <+LandOfTheWay> didn't that big sword made of swords mention a revenger?
[1:53:04] <%Brassnarwhal> patches just told me to help out rya but I don't remember who that is or where she is
[1:53:05] <Hepathos87> spooky music
[1:53:11] <+alphonseisbest> @cade_calrayn what he miss there?
[1:53:19] <%solracc25> Meta Gear?
[1:53:22] <+Shimano232> Oh Pat, did you go back and talk to the knight at the top of Morne castle after getting  his sword?
[1:53:25] <%bundle_of_herbs> maybe something happens at night
[1:53:28] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt you have to go back to visit the girl after you delivered her letter to her father at Castle Morne
[1:53:31] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt did you go talk to irina's dad after you found her dead?
[1:53:33] <PlatinumWyvern> i got invade by an npc here
[1:53:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's definitely a shack
[1:53:39] <%chitinoir> @cade_calrayn he back to her went last stream
[1:53:43] <%solracc25> Raiden shack
[1:53:47] <+ithonmage> maybe something is hidden?
[1:53:49] <%cade_calrayn> Then go talk to the dad again
[1:53:54] <%tusk102> i thought he did?
[1:53:56] <+LandOfTheWay> you need to talk to the dad again
[1:54:07] <%cade_calrayn> You have to find her dead, talk to the dad again, and then go back to her
[1:54:11] <MaritimeSpanker> maybe not yet, pat
[1:54:14] <ConflagrationsGaming> @bundle_of_herbs thank you so much! had no idea that that was on. I'd been puzzled as to why this was happening in every stream i was in. ( and nice icon )
[1:54:20] <+ajeanstarks78 > he gone
[1:54:21] <MaritimeSpanker> could be a quest NPC later on
[1:54:22] <%tusk102> not yet
[1:54:22] <Sunstalker> Confirm she's dead, go talk to dad again after beating the boss of the castle. Then he'll spawn at her corpse
[1:54:26] <%austinj24> You're missing the scrimblimblo
[1:54:32] <Sunstalker> beyond that I don't know what he goes off to do
[1:54:34] <%solracc25> try blood
[1:54:38] <%tusk102> you need the fraggle bandana
[1:54:39] <PlatinumWyvern> @PatStaresAt i got invaded here by an npc
[1:54:40] <%cade_calrayn> It's part of the questline, you have to go tell the dad after you've found her dead
[1:54:40] <jubejube56> yeah maybe jump to the rock with horse double jump
[1:54:44] <jubejube56> off that wooden platform
[1:54:45] <Assaultpanda> could be a time of day thing
[1:54:49] <C1ic> maybe at night something happens
[1:54:50] <%OrangeMDT> It’s girl, dad, girl, dad, dad (at girl’s place)
[1:54:51] <%bundle_of_herbs> @ConflagrationsGaming no problem!
[1:54:55] <+jacksawjack> horse jump from the wood to the stones
[1:55:32] <%whyskeywolfe> Yeah apparently she dies if you leave before talking to the dad.
[1:55:33] <%OrangeMDT> Hey, I didn’t want this
[1:55:39] <Hepathos87> man everyone is happy here
[1:55:43] <luciluxlu0> Warmaster shack has a hidden boss fight
[1:55:50] <%cade_calrayn> Nah, she dies all the time
[1:55:56] <Sunstalker> No, she seems to die no matter what
[1:56:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> i didn't do that and she still died
[1:56:06] <%ShawnTK_> She always dies
[1:56:06] <@Ranryu692> no she dies if you don't also
[1:56:08] <%X2Eliah> nah, she dies anyway
[1:56:09] <+SaintSalted> go there at night
[1:56:11] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> wait where's the dad?
[1:56:12] <%OrangeMDT> @whyskeywolfe she was made to die
[1:56:12] <%cade_calrayn> It's a Souls game, these quests never have a happy ending
[1:56:13] <+LandOfTheWay> pretty sure she dies no matter what
[1:56:24] <+pugszerosugar> Nighttime
[1:56:26] <%Brassnarwhal> did pat run into deathbird?
[1:56:26] <Sunstalker> Pat's beaten the chimera knight here, right?
[1:56:28] <%whyskeywolfe> @cade_calrayn Oh really? Okay my bad, just what I'd heard.
[1:56:30] <ConflagrationsGaming> i love how there's literally been 4 different answers and its created 3 questions
[1:56:33] <razieltano123> @PatStaresAt  She always dies.
[1:56:37] <luciluxlu0> you talk to the guy and wait till night time
[1:56:46] <+abrupt_abe> Can't wait to beat this and replay it with a NPC quest guide
[1:57:00] <+LandOfTheWay> woolie inspires us
[1:57:04] <Sunstalker> Aw holy shit, these enemies got red pants on ps5? Shit's much less vibrant on ps4
[1:57:06] <%solracc25> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[1:57:09] <+pugszerosugar> Think Virgil boss
[1:57:09] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt do you want us to tell you if there's a day/night boss in a place you've been?
[1:57:10] <+TDotGoat> Pat stares at lies
[1:57:12] <Hepathos87> bound by doody
[1:57:16] <%MelBrooksKA> I love lying to Pat
[1:57:19] <%whyskeywolfe> Now go to where she was.
[1:57:19] <Aussie_Manny> Chat, stop lying. That's Woolie's schtick.
[1:57:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> If you don't talk to Scrimblo then Satan himself comes and burns all the Scrunko Fields and your playthrough is ruined forever

[1:58:16] <%livlinn> grymP
[1:58:18] <Aussie_Manny> I can't believe you're a Skeleton Warrior.
[1:58:21] <Aussie_Manny> It's come full circle.
[1:58:23] <Sunstalker> It's amazing how they made heavy and jump attacks so vital for melee builds
[1:58:24] <+ithonmage> there's a lot of places to run away in this game, I can see invading being hard
[1:58:24] <+jacksawjack> Try tailoring and see if you can braid it's hair.
[1:58:37] <+lucky_icarus> Anyone know just how far into the game you can get the bloody wolf armor, the poster armor?
[1:58:41] <jubejube56> All this getting attacked stuff just reminds me of trying to fast travel when there is a Deviljho on the map
[1:59:02] <+ReallyBigRocks> I literally haven't found a single piece of gear I can alter
[1:59:17] <%D00msDayDan> HOW CAN THIS BE

[2:12:22] <%tusk102> oof
[2:12:25] <KasiCrafter> After Sekiro you'd think Fromsoft would make parrying ALWAYS viable
[2:12:25] <TheDeimion> can't generally summon for invader types
[2:12:26] <%PesterChunklage> most of his attacks have high end lag so the good ole roll into him should cheese
[2:12:27] <feaxel> buff flask
[2:12:27] <Sigma_190_Beta> @mrcelab He can't show up here.

[2:13:13] <mrcelab> @mrcelab why?
[2:13:16] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> When did Pat become tar man from RLD?
[2:13:17] <Gnukko88> It's an executioner sword. no point because it's for beheading
[2:13:20] <%solracc25> This is a Sith Lord
[2:13:21] <%whyskeywolfe> "Feed the dog" is code kids
[2:13:23] <%YakumoYomi> Take your time
[2:13:23] <TheDeimion> don't you hate getting up from a rest in the middle of the night and getting giga drill BREAKAH'd into oblivion on your way to the toilet? 4Head
[2:13:25] <%topendbuzza> waking the maiden paige
[2:13:27] <+alphonseisbest> If this dude and Oleg meet it BO TOOO COOL THE UNIVERSE WOULD EXSPOLDE
[2:13:28] <xxHungryxx> and a command grab too
[2:13:30] <%Monkeyweed21> It’s way cooler than a dark wraith grab
[2:13:30] <TheDeimion> fucking sucks
[2:13:41] <%OrangeMDT> It’s 2 pm
[2:13:51] <mrcelab> Boys, why he cant summon Oleg there?
[2:13:58] <%topendbuzza> it's wake up time somewhere
[2:14:00] <%Jumpie8> est
[2:14:16] <%Monkeyweed21> I have never wanted a play as the enemy mod more than this game
[2:14:19] <%Brassnarwhal> @mrcelab you can only summon when the gravestone symbol is on the left of the screen
[2:14:25] <%cade_calrayn> @mrcelab summons are only allowed in certain areas
[2:14:26] <sirrice77> @mrcelab summons are limited to certain locations indicated with a blue icon on the left of the screen
[2:14:27] <TheDeimion> I've seen spin magic somewhere before but it was blue, I wonder what makes this spin magic red
[2:14:44] <mrcelab> Oh, thanx
[2:14:48] <coziestbank> You need to be within a certain distance of some kind of statue for spirt summoning
[2:14:50] <%OrangeMDT> @mrcelab no summon marker. It’s the white gravestone in the middle left
[2:14:57] <%Monkeyweed21> @thedeimion blud/ the dark side
[2:15:07] <TheDeimion> oooo
[2:15:08] <%Puhff> There has to be a Spirit Stone in the area to summon
[2:15:27] <%topendbuzza> boy sure glad the world is fine right now
[2:15:29] <%Puhff> EEEEEEVIIIIIILLLL
[2:15:31] <jubejube56> If you are anti-tree you get cool blood/fire powers

[2:15:41] <%Aeogard> hello gamers, did pat have to have a gamer pee
[2:16:01] <SaltyAzteca> a tree hugger, of course
[2:16:06] <%Dakuu75> was the bird boss behind warmaster's shack (at night) in the beta?
[2:16:08] <%cade_calrayn> Ooooohhhhh. I just found a place north of the Revenger's Shack with 4 portals that need items to activate. Bet that's how you get up on the cliffs
[2:16:18] <@MistyMntns> @Aeogard He has to wake the Maiden Peach and let the mount Geif out.
[2:16:40] <%cade_calrayn> *3 portals it seem
[2:16:42] <%Aeogard> Even Patron isn't Maidenless....

[2:16:58] <SaltyAzteca> @dakuu75 oh did pat meet that bird? Scared the fuck outta me the first time seeing it
[2:17:08] <%cade_calrayn> you wanna talk about death birds? the creatures in Caelid are horrifying
[2:17:18] <%cade_calrayn> wait where's the deathbird?

[2:17:52] <%Brassnarwhal> @dakuu75 I'm really glad i had the lance talisman cause otherwise i wouldnt do enough damage to it
[2:17:53] <blitzmentalist> hullo

[2:18:36] <ConflagrationsGaming> continue to say burger
[2:18:36] <%Brassnarwhal> maybe they mean the physic?
[2:18:38] <+treasonodb> that is good dog
[2:18:43] <SaltyAzteca> @dakuu75 oho, Its the first time im seeing pats stream so i dunno either
[2:18:48] <%abakkus> what a good boy, sitting still for his daily facial cleanse
[2:18:52] <mrtanaka111> how many times a day a dog like that needs cleaning?
[2:18:54] <+jubjub388> what a good boi
[2:18:59] <TheDeimion> wow you're looking like a good skeleton , Pat
[2:19:05] <%Brassnarwhal> some people use it as a buff flask instead of a heal flask and pop it at the top of the fight
[2:19:07] <TheDeimion> dog maintenance is important
[2:19:09] <chowndawg> the flask can absorb one hit right?
[2:19:10] <%MelBrooksKA> Remember when Pat was a flask in a jar and convinced a king to sacrifice his nation for immortality?
[2:19:11] <mrtanaka111> thats duable
[2:19:13] <%MelBrooksKA> I member
[2:19:14] <dan_g_v> why is people still asking "did Pat see spoiler thing" in chat?
[2:19:22] <%topendbuzza> everytime he eats i'd imagine
[2:19:34] <mrtanaka111> did pat fght(spoiler) yet
[2:19:43] <%Dakuu75> I like a skeletons with hair on their head.
[2:19:48] <+OniOniOniiii> so to get this boss do i just pursue whatever warmaster dude is talking about?
[2:19:50] <TheDeimion> is he a mix? he kinda looks part doberman
[2:19:57] <TheDeimion> OH PLZ NO!
[2:19:57] <MaritimeSpanker> WHOAH
[2:20:01] <%topendbuzza> OH
[2:20:07] <TheDeimion> OH HE USES FORCE POWERS!??!

[2:20:22] <%Brassnarwhal> @dan_g_v it's not a spoiler if he beat it and if you mean me i was talking to chat while pat was gone, also the name of an enemy isn't a spoiler my guy
[2:20:23] <mrtanaka111> absolute POWAHHHR
[2:20:25] <%greasypete00> this guy's so cool
[2:20:25] <SaltyAzteca> DUEL OF THE FATES
[2:20:27] <AgnusLaplace> he's so cool, holy shit
[2:20:30] <TheDeimion> giga drill force powers
[2:20:32] <ConflagrationsGaming> hes just BELL BEARING HUTNER what do you need to know
[2:20:41] <Guardiansaiyan> @Dakuu75 color text doesn't work anymore
[2:20:42] <%livlinn> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[2:20:43] <+alphonseisbest> @Dakuu75 MOther fucking DARTH BANE OVER HERE
[2:20:47] <MaritimeSpanker> the raaaange
[2:20:51] <TheDeimion> wow the house is totally to your detriment if he can coming attack like that LUL
[2:20:55] <jubejube56> intense boss battle bro, mind if I touch grass for a minute?
[2:20:55] <Noogiez> wall hacks
[2:20:58] <$realm_forge> This guy is fuckin cool
[2:21:02] <mrtanaka111> uhhh that looks cool
[2:21:03] <+ghostfaceninja_> red blade... that he throws... and he force chokes....  Hmm
[2:21:04] <%abakkus> fulfilling the mandatory fantasy archetype of "what if there was a big dude? like a HUGE dude? and he had a sword the size of a motorcycle"
[2:21:04] <+Shimano232> Pat, Just so you know. I have encountered multiple instances of this boss. this is the weakest version.
[2:21:04] <TheDeimion> AAAAA
[2:21:08] <deviljhojho_> fuck man he gives you almost zero breathing space
[2:21:09] <ape_hawk> LAME IT OUT
[2:21:12] <%topendbuzza> THIS GUY fucks
[2:21:15] <+Kodkiro> So is this a good introduction to souls games, or should I play the others first?
[2:21:19] <+kewlmyc> Is he a Sith Lord?
[2:21:20] <%MegboyManuel> MegboyManuel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months! hey Pat, i got a friend from the psa discord to give me their whip when I was summoned to their world. powerstancing 2 whips is very cool. its massive sweeps that can stunlock
[2:21:29] <razieltano123> @PatStaresAt He is a damn Sith Lord.
[2:21:29] <TheDeimion> ok so range is not a very good option LUL
[2:21:34] <deviljhojho_> this one is a brand new animal
[2:21:34] <AngryAsian5> What the fuck, why do all the bosses in this game look so god damn COOL
[2:21:35] <%topendbuzza> play em all when ever
[2:21:39] <%Dakuu75> @Guardiansaiyan the color shows in VoD chat thought. and I like the italics
[2:21:40] <mrtanaka111> this is just every souls put together
[2:21:49] <TheDeimion> it kind of seems to encourage you to stay in to keep that ranged sword away
[2:21:54] <+Kodkiro> Ok might check it out
[2:21:54] <coziestbank> This game is probably so long to 100% that you'd get the entire skill growth in one playthrough for the rest of the games.
[2:21:58] <kirbykyodai> play kingsfield
[2:22:00] <SaltyAzteca> What about DS2 Kappa
[2:22:02] <hermitdab> bloodborne da most fun
[2:22:05] <xxHungryxx> play them all at once
[2:22:06] <TheDeimion> what mix is the smelly baby>?
[2:22:15] <sun312772> friendd
[2:22:20] <mrtanaka111> smells like loyalty
[2:22:23] <TheDeimion> oh bulldog
[2:22:24] <+MustComplete> My first introduction to the souls genre was Bloodborne and I got WRECKED like a little girl LOL XD
[2:22:32] <Stickerfan> Can friend have a smell?
[2:22:37] <+alphonseisbest> COMBOED
[2:22:42] <TheDeimion> that's literally a sith lord
[2:22:45] <%Dakuu75> yep
[2:22:47] <%Puhff> English Bulldog iirc
[2:22:51] <+CapOfAllFools> Like if Darth Vader was born in New Londo.
[2:22:56] <LeeOhX> this guy looks like a parry skill check if i've ever seen one
[2:22:56] <AngryAsian5> That is, indeed, a sith lord
[2:22:57] <Elliott_TF> red trail means it's more powerful.
[2:22:59] <jubejube56> I wonder if there is a way to somehow make it so you always return here at night
[2:23:03] <TheDeimion> ya but it's supose to seem like a random thing that happens LUL
[2:23:17] <ape_hawk> avengers get a tower, revengers get a shack
[2:23:23] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> how do you get the dad to find her body? i went back and he wasn't there
[2:23:28] <TheDeimion> WOOOOW
[2:23:35] <$realm_forge> God I want to make all the weapons in this game
[2:23:45] <hermitdab> the rolling in this game seems very forgiving
[2:23:51] <sirrice77> @yaboi_raidshadowlegends talk to him, beat boss of fort, talk to him again, go back to girl
[2:23:53] <jtsoppy137> pat is not match for the power of the dark side
[2:23:56] <%MelBrooksKA> I thought his name was "Ball Bearing Hunter"
[2:23:58] <AllenDeadman> he went killing everybody responsible for his daughters death
[2:23:58] <SaltyAzteca> its tree sentinel all over again with that hitbox
[2:24:01] <AllenDeadman> went mad
[2:24:02] <TheDeimion> yo the regular strikes PUSH you out of his melee range into the force tosses NotLikeThis
[2:24:05] <ape_hawk> something something revenge something something grrm something something GO CRAZY
[2:24:08] <splicerss> wait... is this Anor Londo?
[2:24:09] <mrtanaka111> pat needs more hate
[2:24:10] <AllenDeadman> and possibly thought you were also partly responsible
[2:24:14] <%whyskeywolfe> as opposed to this guy, who will never be explained
[2:24:21] <TheDeimion> his moveset actively pushes you out into range that's amazing
[2:24:26] <SaltyAzteca> @melbrookska Ball Busting Hunter Kappa
[2:24:33] <LeeOhX> so cool
[2:24:35] <+MustComplete> @MelBrooksKA He has yet to discover his true anger, that's why! XD
[2:24:51] <+alphonseisbest> WHY DON'T ALL SITH FIGHT LIKE THIS?!
[2:24:51] <SolidusA> tap triggers to release
[2:24:53] <splicerss> dead as hell
[2:24:54] <ape_hawk> just do it
[2:24:55] <%topendbuzza> just live
[2:24:55] <deviljhojho_> i guess the only saving grace ofthis guy is that he is not resilient at all
[2:25:00] <%topendbuzza> nor die
[2:25:00] <+Kodkiro> no :)
[2:25:02] <AgnusLaplace> the classic just don't get hit
[2:25:04] <+treasonodb> logical assessment
[2:25:05] <splicerss> perfect
[2:25:07] <Chaos_Aether> No
[2:25:09] <jtsoppy137> hit not get hit got it
[2:25:13] <+alphonseisbest> Its sooo COOL
[2:25:22] <STORMWIZARD1> @PatStaresAt your just a pin cushion LUL
[2:25:30] <coziestbank> Feels like Capra style  - There will just be multiple of this dude or something later
[2:25:32] <%whyskeywolfe> Watched Little V solo Margit last night without levelling once. Would love to see him try this guy.
[2:25:36] <+Rellim80> It's just Vader. They just put Darth Vader in the game.
[2:25:37] <jtsoppy137> new attack
[2:25:38] <%topendbuzza> wow
[2:25:38] <splicerss> does that weapon art also buff his halberd?

[2:35:35] <Ell1ot> i'd like to play this game but i was told to wait because i have pc
[2:35:37] <%AutomatedSquid> @austinj24 gotta go to the church across from spawn and talk to the cute witch lady that shows up at night
[2:35:40] <+Shimano232> @austinj24 go back to the church Kale is at. you should find the answer there if you have torrent already.

[3:57:33] <%Brassnarwhal> @austinj24 I don't like the implications of younger hands either
[3:57:35] <%OrangeMDT> Can’t wait for the next game to be about ears and fighting big ears or some shit
[3:57:35] <+KingKrampus> @austinj24 via their wrist ussy
[3:57:36] <datNOISE> PauseChamp

[3:57:53] <%baka_sugoi> DA FINGIER
[3:57:55] <$mysterypork> Wonder Miyasaki was smoking when he came up with this part of the game...

[3:58:14] <%Jigokuro> Seems like a good plan
[3:58:14] <%Deft_Thought> YEAH BEAT HIS ASS
[3:58:19] <thesaverofhumens> I can't imagine what the boss is if the theme here is "spider hands"
[3:58:19] <%Brassnarwhal> it's like the scene with the hand from Splinter, pretty good movie
[3:58:19] <@Spydurman> good plan
[3:58:20] <%hereiam407> You think that's a pinky? No, just small middle finger.
[3:58:21] <%notsoy> OPleg
[3:58:23] <razieltano123> @PatStaresAt This place can go fuck itself.
[3:58:29] <+KingKrampus> @austinj24 wrussy
[3:58:36] <TheDeimion> how much fp do you need for Oleg?
[3:58:41] <%austinj24> @sirgo0se Oh god why
[3:58:44] <%hereiam407> What do they eat?
[3:58:46] <TheDeimion> ok
[3:58:49] <+imthewisejanitor> I mean, whether it's 5 fingers or 100, it can really only have one or two middle fingers.
[3:58:49] <%Brassnarwhal> @thesaverofhumens I'm surprised godric isn't here he *Loves* hands
[3:58:58] <dan_g_v> just stick to the path and no step on grass?
[3:59:03] <TheDeimion> do you think that's the highest summon in terms of FP usage?
[3:59:04] <+ReallyJustKyle> Beware the Gorilla Grip
[3:59:04] <Heyestus> Finger food  @hereiam407
[3:59:05] <%topendbuzza> bye Oleg
[3:59:09] <thesaverofhumens> @Brassnarwhal I was thinking about that too
[3:59:10] <dan_g_v> why is Oleg's connection so bad?
[3:59:13] <%Deft_Thought> This is some real Seath shit
[3:59:15] <%hereiam407> @Heyestus Yay!
[3:59:16] <xerotwo> MILLHOUSE
[3:59:17] <%notsoy> caria, more like maria
[3:59:19] <Sigma_190_Beta> Isn't Raini the girl who gave you the summoning stuff?
[3:59:22] <+bmj614> If Monster Hunter's monsters had health meters I would play it
[3:59:27] <+2earthearth> @PatStaresAt is it possible for you to show off your full map?
[3:59:39] <%austinj24> ROBOT HOOOOOOUSE
[3:59:44] <%hereiam407> Damn
[3:59:47] <%topendbuzza> lel MH does not need HB
[3:59:48] <+2earthearth> thank you!
[3:59:49] <%hereiam407> Do you ever get a boat
[3:59:56] <@Spydurman> jesus fucking christ
[3:59:56] <%mythcreant> so beeg
[4:00:04] <dan_g_v> @bmj614 the monsters show how much they have, tho
[4:00:10] <%Bloomingzonda> So Ludwig has been playing this game almost continuosly on stream since launch having only taken a couple sleep breaks. He is now to what is supposed to be the final area only because he found a shortcut to skip several areas
[4:00:10] <thesaverofhumens> he's only uncovered a small part of the map
[4:00:11] <%gitgouda> @bmj614 but mah tensions and adrenaline rush though
[4:00:12] <%Brassnarwhal> click the stick show underground too
[4:00:14] <pi_in_the_sci> plus the underground
[4:00:18] <%SirGO0SE> that spot on the far east that you have to teleport to is insane for farming
[4:00:18] <%abakkus> you do get a horse, which is basically a land boat
[4:00:19] <XxMoliciousxX> well this is just map 1 world 1
[4:00:21] <%austinj24> This is too much lmao
[4:00:25] <Heyestus> Man imagine if some character just hands you a second map for the dark world or some shit
[4:00:29] <jubejube56> there are at least 5 shards of the elden ring and that map size looks like it holds about 4 zones
[4:00:33] <%hereiam407> Land boats count
[4:00:33] <%SirGO0SE> each lil goblin over there is worth 1k
[4:00:36] <%greasypete00> i wonder if therell be dlc for this game
[4:00:37] <$Smokay17> Just steal the ghost boats.
[4:01:01] <%Brassnarwhal> @xxmoliciousxx kinda, at least one of the zones is underground
[4:01:05] <+alphonseisbest> wai
[4:01:07] <%Bloomingzonda> @greasypete00 Supposedly this is a base to sell quite a bit of DLC
[4:01:08] <%Piemen99> I wonder if it's possible to kill every enemy on the map, (not including bosses)
[4:01:15] <%hereiam407> I would love this with a dash of Death Stranding, with ziplines.
[4:01:16] <+alphonseisbest> dope
[4:01:26] <%greasypete00> thats pog
[4:01:27] <MaritimeSpanker> its nuts
[4:01:31] <%tusk102> JESUS CHRIST
[4:01:32] <%hereiam407> nuts
[4:01:37] <%JonathLP> What could possibly not already be in here?
[4:01:37] <%Pookiedaexzile> MAp Bigger
[4:01:38] <jtsoppy137> Land of reeds DLC Kappa
[4:01:40] <%Brassnarwhal> @bloomingzonda i fucking hope so, the more elden ring the better shits gold all the way down
[4:01:41] <+Kodkiro> this game is too big
[4:01:42] <%Piemen99> Well then
[4:01:42] <%gitgouda> thats awesome but what and how?
[4:01:43] <%LorcaNomad> that's fucking insane
[4:01:43] <Hoaxfish> Elden Ring: Cockney DLC
[4:01:44] <%notsoy> if one of the DLC is a BOTW-style hang-glider, yes
[4:01:44] <+bravo059> @Brassnarwhal the underground zone is so pretty
[4:01:44] <%cade_calrayn> Looking at the full map, there's room to be added
[4:01:45] <%austinj24> WORLD 2
[4:01:46] <+KingKrampus> JUMP
[4:01:49] <%tusk102> watch the dlc be as big as dark souls 3's entire map
[4:01:49] <Heyestus> Maybe something like BitterBlack Isle for dragons dogma.
[4:01:50] <%Deft_Thought> Bet you fight a dude there
[4:01:51] <%Treuan> I don't trust that note
[4:01:53] <TheDeimion> so is this a world where things become zombies but only when you graft limbs and stuff to other things?
[4:01:54] <%gitgouda> big painting
[4:01:55] <%JonathLP> Jump, pat, jump
[4:01:56] <chowndawg> dark world
[4:01:57] <thesaverofhumens> @Piemen99 enemies respawn after the zone is derendered from a certain distance
[4:01:57] <%discoinfierno> It's going to be the best selling From game of all time. Not surprised at all
[4:01:58] <@Spydurman> this game could really use some more content, it's kinda sparse Kappa
[4:01:59] <%gitgouda> HUGE PAINTING DLC
[4:01:59] <razieltano123> @PatStaresAt You can when all of the company works in one project.
[4:02:08] <Frranky> bastard ahead indeed
[4:02:13] <Hoaxfish> Bri'ish Teeth Tranished
[4:02:18] <%austinj24> Good note
[4:02:22] <%Piemen99> @Piemen99 aw
[4:02:23] <%Brassnarwhal> @bravo059 siofra depths might be the most beautiful area I've seen in any video game SeemsGood
[4:02:31] <TheDeimion> I'm trying to figur out why these hands are zombies
[4:02:39] <%Bloomingzonda> I could imagine the DLC being like "we hear tell of a ferry to this other land" kind of thing
[4:02:40] <TheDeimion> finger out Keepo *
[4:02:45] <%topendbuzza> is there a soft cap on stats?
[4:02:53] <Gorgs7> yeah, being big tough is helping paige
[4:02:53] <%Brassnarwhal> @thedeimion the death rune was stolen when the elden ring shattered and now nothing can die
[4:03:05] <TheDeimion> ohhhh
[4:03:05] <%Piemen99> it'll be cool, jump!
[4:03:06] <%notsoy> i heard 30/31 is SC for strength
[4:03:06] <%Jigokuro> Probably, but it isn't 40.
[4:03:08] <Sigma_190_Beta> You need Vigor to make the Armor better, and you also probably want like more Strength for your catalyst.
[4:03:09] <TheAntiNihilist> Heater Shield is OP in this game
[4:03:09] <@Fuggins4U> !uptime
[4:03:10] <@Moobot> @Fuggins4U I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 3m.
[4:03:12] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt what about strength for the other faith halberd you have?
[4:03:13] <thesaverofhumens> @topendbuzza some items have really insane requirements like 60 int
[4:03:17] <XxMoliciousxX> I assume soft is 40 hard is 50?
[4:03:21] <%Monkeyweed21> You seem good on damage but could use more health
[4:03:26] <%hereiam407> dman
[4:03:26] <dan_g_v> non stop spawn?
[4:03:31] <%Brassnarwhal> @thedeimion it's like that time in family guy when death broke his ankle or whatever, was that family guy even?
[4:03:40] <%Deft_Thought> They're just gonna keep comin, it looks like
[4:03:41] <thesaverofhumens> there's a spell that requires 70 int too
[4:03:42] <TheDeimion> I was about to say LUL
[4:03:48] <@Fuggins4U> oh yeah!
[4:03:49] <jtsoppy137> magic grenades
[4:03:49] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt Also Strength for your catalyst since it scales off of Strength.
[4:03:51] <%Brassnarwhal> it's been like a tually a decade
[4:03:52] <narusao> nemuDed
[4:03:53] <ExpressNode> And they don't stop coming
[4:03:59] <dan_g_v> endless spawn time!
[4:03:59] <@Fuggins4U> and they don't stop comin
[4:04:03] <@Fuggins4U> dang it
[4:04:21] <%hereiam407> Hit the ground running
[4:04:24] <Frranky> much like hideo kojima they'll keep coming
[4:04:24] <Gorgs7> plus, guts sword when you find it
[4:04:26] <TheDeimion> ya those magic homing pots are fucking scary
[4:04:29] <Foxchad> just tuned in. hows the elden pat? has it been ringing?
[4:04:31] <thesaverofhumens> this game really wants you to specialize in things
[4:04:32] <XxMoliciousxX> maybe they changed it so it's just 99 max with small increments
[4:04:44] <%Brassnarwhal> the amount of options this game gives you to slove problems seems to have allowed them to make everything a lot harder to confront head on
[4:04:51] <TheDeimion> can you MAKE those pots?
[4:04:55] <TheDeimion> because those seem busted
[4:04:56] <%Monkeyweed21> did pat find the super pyromancy in liurna
[4:05:05] <%austinj24> good rolls
[4:05:14] <%Brassnarwhal> @thedeimion almost certainly but you have to find the right cookbook
[4:05:20] <TheDeimion> that's dirty~
[4:05:24] <+gaussboat> did the potman ever show up yet
[4:05:31] <TheDeimion> ohhhh oh noooo
[4:05:36] <TheDeimion> so many
[4:05:40] <%Brassnarwhal> @thedeimion the faith pots cost fp to throw though so these ones probably would as well
[4:05:42] <%Bloomingzonda> It also seems weird from other Souls games that is seems like it wants you to have a strong base in everything and then a specialtity
[4:05:43] <TheDeimion> and they have the pots NotLikeThis
[4:05:44] <thesaverofhumens> they don't stop comin
[4:05:44] <ExpressNode> Looks like the only solution is gunning it to the next area
[4:06:01] <TheDeimion> ya but they'd still be busted
[4:06:08] <TheDeimion> like they melt even now
[4:06:12] <%Brassnarwhal> @gaussboat pat found him for the first encounter but I don't think he has found him a second time
[4:06:14] <%austinj24> oh this area is a fuck
[4:06:33] <sun312772> Hey Pat I just beat the very first boss and enemy of the game with a Wretch and can finally start experiencing the rest of Elden Ring, I'm very excited
[4:06:34] <%hereiam407> Chose war
[4:06:38] <ExpressNode> Looks like its great for farming....if you don't die
[4:06:38] <TheDeimion> this area is just paranoia
[4:06:46] <%gitgouda> yeeeees almost there man you got this
[4:06:55] <razieltano123> @PatStaresAt Do you think that Called is being overhyped as a dangerous place?
[4:07:02] <TheDeimion> icing on the cake if there was a mimic up here
[4:07:25] <razieltano123> Oh OK
[4:07:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @razieltano123 it’s not that place is horrific
[4:07:34] <+bravo059> Calid is a whole mess.
[4:07:35] <TheDeimion> are you even in the manor yet? LUL
[4:07:35] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah no the animals there are fucking HORRIFYING
[4:07:36] <Mirrorcatch> it sucks bro
[4:07:36] <BlueBiscuitGT> Big DOGS
[4:07:39] <%hereiam407> woof
[4:07:40] <$Smokay17> I would love for there to be a single mimic in the whole game.
[4:07:43] <%hereiam407> bork
[4:07:48] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt much easier with your +8 weapon
[4:07:49] <%Brassnarwhal> @sun312772 the tutorial one or the second tutorial one or the one the the third tutorial one or the one in the first legacy dungeon
[4:07:51] <TheDeimion> big borkus
[4:07:51] <AndreDingus> big dog status
[4:07:52] <%twohitgood> caelid has some interesting attractions. I didn't fight much but I ran around exploring everything. some really cool sights.
[4:07:52] <zettig> plus everything has scarlet rot, which is this game's version of toxic
[4:07:59] <Sigma_190_Beta> I think you now have 2 Sacred Tears.
[4:08:02] <%NotVeryLegendary> Calid has a nice little town in it though
[4:08:09] <jubejube56> You want to go BACK to hand hell?
[4:08:10] <%Pookiedaexzile> @Smokay17 Do six finger trapdoor spider hands count
[4:08:12] <dan_g_v> I thought scarlet rot was instnat death

[4:08:14] <wingsolight> caelid got some dope bosses
[4:08:15] <%greasypete00> those t-rex dogs scare the shit out of me
[4:08:19] <PizzicatoFive5> so we're in Dark Souls land now?
[4:08:29] <luciluxlu0> fire works
[4:08:33] <Sigma_190_Beta> I think he meant Critical Hits.
[4:08:38] <TheDeimion> ya it's just the aoe that fucks you
[4:08:41] <+Resderp> @PizzicatoFive5 Its kinda like the covenant forest in DS1
[4:08:43] <%Brassnarwhal> i went to caelid ind got my ass beat by random jobbers constantly it's not being overhyped
[4:08:47] <Heyestus> Have you been back to beat up the shrimp people in that crystal mine? @patstaresat
[4:09:02] <sun312772> @Brassnarwhal the tutorial boss that's suppose to kill you at the very start
[4:09:05] <dan_g_v> are they shrimp mages or centipedes?
[4:09:10] <%Brassnarwhal> @heyestus those shrimp guys are fucks
[4:09:16] <%Movemeister> Yo master hand is keeping it real
[4:09:21] <youngin_______420> gross
[4:09:25] <wingsolight> centipedes
[4:09:35] <%Pookiedaexzile> MAke it stop moving like that
[4:09:40] <youngin_______420> smash bros final boss
[4:09:41] <%Brassnarwhal> @sun312772 you are insane to beat that with the wretch hat's off to you
[4:09:46] <%hereiam407> Nice, the middle finger
[4:09:48] <Hepathos87> I cant wait for the lore dump for the whole hands and fingers imaginary
[4:10:12] <%Brassnarwhal> @movemeister that's definitely crazy hand
[4:10:13] <%baka_sugoi> OK
[4:10:14] <BlueBiscuitGT> found rythm!
[4:10:18] <%hereiam407> Clap
[4:10:19] <thesaverofhumens> drowning in upgrade materials
[4:10:22] <%NotVeryLegendary> I noticed with some enemies that if they notice you but aren't immediately hostile, as long as you don't guard or attack at them they won't engage
[4:10:26] <dan_g_v> as long as 20 little spider hands are not bothering you, they are easy!
[4:10:32] <%hereiam407> And you'll never die again
[4:10:53] <%Brassnarwhal> @pookiedaexzile you should watch the movie Splinter, if these guys wig you out that's a great scary movie for you
[4:10:56] <%tusk102> thats the good one
[4:10:57] <Hepathos87> karen piercer
[4:10:57] <%LorcaNomad> it sure sounds cool
[4:11:01] <senfood> I love it when you watch someone get good in real time.
[4:11:05] <%tusk102> its one of the spells the magic knight starts with
[4:11:11] <%tusk102> in the beta
[4:11:17] <+Resderp> So ive learned that there's nothing wrong with using stealth to get past some hard sections in this game, since early on some things are just brutal (Looking at you Silver Knights)
[4:11:26] <djblue_shift> It’d be funny if they ambushed you by dropping from the ceiling
[4:11:28] <%Brassnarwhal> is it a charged magic sword thrust?
[4:11:30] <odnucaf3> What the insects gives you stuffs? I tought tgey only refill frasks.
[4:11:33] <sun312772> @Brassnarwhal i just couldn't allow myself to start elden ring until i beat, took three days of making new characters to retry the fight until i kill her a few minutes ago
[4:11:48] <%Brassnarwhal> @djblue_shift some were on walls
[4:11:57] <%Pookiedaexzile> @Brassnarwhal Thanks for the Rec, I'll check it out
[4:12:30] <Aussie_Manny> Fountain of Fuck
[4:12:45] <%morningmoondude> i just tuned in and i don't like these hand things not one fucking bit
[4:12:58] <Frranky> I hate those things so much
[4:13:08] <Frranky> I rather have spiders
[4:13:10] <Aussie_Manny> Are you telling me this LITERAL HAND doesn't have a GRAB move??
[4:13:10] <Hepathos87> Mr Hands
[4:13:13] <TheDeimion> it seems the meatball like stumb is susceptible to stunlock
[4:13:15] <+Occisorz> wow cousin it got big
[4:13:17] <Ohkaru> when they're idle they caress the ground :)
[4:13:20] <TheDeimion> also get fuct I guess 4Head
[4:13:26] <%Pookiedaexzile> THEY'RE IN THE TREEs
[4:13:26] <Frranky> the small ones are somehow worse than the big ones
[4:13:28] <%twohitgood> less fucking, more handjobs
[4:13:29] <razieltano123> Just run and collect items.
[4:13:29] <CaptHoneydew> the hands heard you talking shit
[4:13:30] <dan_g_v> seems like eating some stamina boosting food would be good for this place
[4:13:31] <gerudokin> I'm ready for Elden Ring to take up a third of the podcast tomorrow
[4:13:33] <%SirGO0SE> 👉 👌 (Pat live)
[4:13:34] <%hereiam407> become as gods
[4:13:40] <Aussie_Manny> ☝️
[4:13:41] <MaritimeSpanker> Maybe they're the remnants of the old royal family
[4:13:42] <thesaverofhumens> finger lickin good
[4:13:46] <MaritimeSpanker> turned into super worship
[4:13:47] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[4:13:50] <%hereiam407> Oh my goodness
[4:13:53] <dan_g_v> the hands are angels?
[4:13:54] <+Freaknick1> It's the god hand
[4:13:58] <%hereiam407> Finger party
[4:13:58] <youngin_______420> its a party
[4:13:59] <Aussie_Manny> shotoGlow
[4:14:00] <Frranky> it took me forever to realize the finger imagery is because rings
[4:14:03] <%LorcaNomad> monkaS
[4:14:03] <jubejube56> Well there are the 2 fingers which are the "good ones" but there are also the 3 fingers which are the "heresy ones"
[4:14:04] <%notsoy> horrid
[4:14:06] <ExpressNode> A whole new meaning to "catching these hands"
[4:14:07] <%baka_sugoi> RUNAWAYYYY
[4:14:09] <super_ej8> monkaS
[4:14:09] <dan_g_v> everything went wrong! Wrong!
[4:14:10] <TheDeimion> did they like steal other ppl's  fingers and graft them to their own as practice of nobility?
[4:14:17] <+alphonseisbest> dat regen

[4:16:22] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt The lore on the crest you picked up from that Giant has Ranni's name on it.

[4:17:22] <razieltano123> Sorry Pat.
[4:17:22] <+Resderp> Fighting Tree Sentinel is night impossible because of all the dust he kicks up even on medium graphics settings. It causes my FPS to go haywire.

[4:18:21] <+Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> TWSS
[4:18:23] <oz19999> That wolf does not fear the power of God
[4:18:26] <MaritimeSpanker> What's wrong with Wolfie?
[4:18:29] <%Deft_Thought> That's Blaidd's little brother! How could you!

[4:18:44] <MaritimeSpanker> Pat, how can this game not make your OCD go nuts?

[4:18:50] <%VictorVonLouche> Also hidden item
[4:18:50] <Laseki> how fucking big is this game
[4:18:51] <+Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Dark of the Souls
[4:18:51] <TheDeimion> this game is like a zoo

[4:19:16] <MaritimeSpanker> Well yeah, you seem to have found more stuff than many many others
[4:19:28] <%morningmoondude> it probably also helps that he can't press a button and be slammed with a hundred tasks to do at all times
[4:19:37] <%SveriSageAdvice> OCD people actually tend to do pretty well with games like these in general, they just take a long time to beat em lol
[4:19:52] <%hereiam407> Idk if I ever want to go back to giant hand town
[4:19:55] <narusao> like with that ladder  Kappa
[4:20:02] <TheSinner42> so did pat start the bloodstain quest?
[4:20:21] <TheDeimion> This game is a Fromsoft zoo of ideas for the player to explore , seeing different things depending on the time of day and circumstance , super smart way of getting all the nifty ideas they've had but couldn't really integrate them into their other works
[4:20:22] <thesaverofhumens> I appreciate that the items scattered around aren't just 5 assfarts, they're actually things you can use for your character
[4:20:24] <TheSinner42> ok
[4:20:27] <ape_hawk> no but he started the cumstain quest
[4:20:30] <ohno58> the what quest?
[4:20:34] <+Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> >herba
[4:20:46] <%LorcaNomad> oh hello monkaS

[4:21:29] <TheSinner42> there is a bloodstain in that room with the face
[4:21:32] <ohno58> I like the castles in this game. They look more like acutal casltes than the disney cathedral shit they did in past games.
[4:21:33] <%hereiam407> Who was the cane dude
[4:21:38] <%tusk102> @Aussie_Manny to transcend the height
[4:21:38] <%hereiam407> nice
[4:22:09] <+Resderp> Stealth is a legitimate tactic for some areas
[4:22:09] <thesaverofhumens> It's amazing to see what fromsoft can actually do when they don't have to rush/cut things
[4:22:19] <Aussie_Manny> Didn't work. Bad message.

[4:25:45] <%LorcaNomad> they just got a lot of hp
[4:25:58] <Heyestus> The hard truth nobody wants to accept is that dogs are better than wolves.
[4:26:15] <Heyestus> that's  why dogs are everywhere and wolves are endangered
[4:26:16] <TheDeimion> it's either been stronger/healthier lookingregular wolves or beefier more fucked up monster dogs
[4:26:17] <+alphonseisbest> lol

[4:43:07] <penitentpendant> TBF, this game caters to all builds
[4:43:09] <thesaverofhumens> it rewards all play types I guess
[4:43:11] <penitentpendant> Which is nice
[4:43:16] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> The game wants for you to run a faith build
[4:43:18] <%TheAdMerlin> Sorcery with one hand, faith with the other
[4:43:18] <+Shimano232> I have a spell with a 70 int requirement.
[4:43:19] <%OrangeMDT> What does quality build mean??
[4:43:27] <stevenellis386> thats something I would grind for
[4:43:28] <%Brassnarwhal> @twohitgood with so much xp available all the time making you invest in multiple stats keeps things hard
[4:43:33] <%LorcaNomad> hey pat have you found any shields yet that are viable weapons?
[4:43:33] <MavMedic81> Reggie
[4:43:34] <digaogrunge> This zone is all about the casting tho
[4:43:38] <TheDeimion> legit options for ppl that want spellsword nonsense
[4:43:47] <%VictorVonLouche> Found a staff needing like 52 int
[4:43:47] <%epide> COMMIT
[4:43:50] <zettig> I've noticed that a lot of strength weapons require some dex investment
[4:43:52] <%cylish> @Shimano232 is it any good?
[4:43:55] <%austinj24> WTF
[4:43:55] <%Brassnarwhal> omnicaster sword
[4:43:56] <%NotVeryLegendary> I've been trying to run a dex / int build and have been forced into running dual bleed daggers early on with magic to get any real dmg in
[4:43:56] <FikodUbalstinthad> does int let you cast faster still?
[4:43:56] <thesaverofhumens> @Shimano232 to be fair that spell is ridiculous
[4:43:57] <+wummzy> yea 60 is the new 40 on soft cap
[4:43:58] <%twohitgood> @orangemdt quality means you spread your stats around instead of specializing
[4:44:08] <+Resderp> I found a summon that costs 100 FP. I only have 80.
[4:44:08] <%RealThiele> just 2h the spell 5head
[4:44:10] <%Brassnarwhal> JESUS
[4:44:12] <+Freakin_Wolfy> what does a 70 faith spell do? just set off a nuke?
[4:44:22] <thesaverofhumens> oleg?
[4:44:23] <%Brassnarwhal> @resderp oleg costs 100
[4:44:24] <TheDeimion> things to aspire to for like 100+ hours that aren't

[5:04:59] <dan_g_v> what did the dog do?
[5:05:01] <MaritimeSpanker> he despawned
[5:05:02] <ExpressNode> That has to be a bug right?
[5:05:02] <penitentpendant> His planet needed him
[5:05:02] <GhostPyre> lmao
[5:05:02] <%JonathLP> He fled
[5:05:02] <Hepathos87> he went back to his home planet

[5:05:10] <+Local16> He portaled out
[5:05:10] <dan_g_v> moved too far away?
[5:05:11] <+Shimano232> That dragon is either weird or bugged because it just despawns at 1/2hp and never comes back... aleast I couldn't find it.
[5:05:12] <darce_avidson> that's SUPPOSED to happen
[5:05:12] <outrogabriel> it fucked-off
[5:05:12] <+trustross> i thought he was about to flashstep
[5:05:13] <MaritimeSpanker> go back where you fought him, up there

[5:05:31] <+Local16> He cast a spell and fucked off
[5:05:32] <%Mister_McDerp> if thats intentional thats an even worse design choice
[5:05:32] <darce_avidson> you can find him again later
[5:05:33] <thesaverofhumens> maybe thats why the zone is so big
[5:05:36] <%austinj24> it fucked off?

[5:06:32] <+SaintSalted> it looked like a bug there was no effect or anything
[5:06:33] <+nekodelic> did it flew away because you took to long or something else?
[5:06:34] <%JonathLP> @PatStaresAt It's the same bullshit of the digging monsters just going underground and then teleporting to the other side of the map like in MHW.

[5:22:58] <penitentpendant> TBH, it's harder to do the game 'in order' if you do ANY sort of exploration

[5:29:47] <+Kodkiro> Not that this is a complaint, but it feels like stuff just happens in this game
[5:29:47] <%Brassnarwhal> @penitentpendant thats what i expect from the zone that is led by magical sword summoners
[5:29:50] <%SaiyanShoto> He ran home to his mama to cry
[5:29:52] <darce_avidson> that you can only get to via a certain NPC's sidequest

[5:33:05] <universaltorkus> Nothin but normal dogs
[5:33:06] <Aussie_Manny> It can't be for nothing.
[5:33:08] <%SirGO0SE> the reward is the fight :)
[5:33:08] <Sigma_190_Beta> She shows up at the starting chuch at night.
[5:33:10] <dan_g_v> Oleg wouldn't have been able to do it without your help, Pat!
[5:33:12] <%OrangeMDT> That’s just a regular enemy
[5:33:13] <razieltano123> @PatStaresAt Wiki Says that the dragon is near Cathedral Manus Celes.

[5:33:48] <pi_in_the_sci> I saw some evergoal worms
[5:33:51] <%Kevlar_Caviar> you can cross that, i did it earlier
[5:33:57] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt it's on the southern cliffs that are unreachable. Just keep going along the Blaidd/Renna questline and you'll get there eventually
[5:34:01] <%Aeogard> you totally can cross it tho
[5:34:01] <digaogrunge> EVERGAOL
[5:34:02] <MaritimeSpanker> yeeee
[5:34:03] <Aussie_Manny> Nice try, chat.
[5:34:05] <%Aeogard> just horse platforming

[5:34:12] <MaritimeSpanker> I hope you get his armor
[5:34:14] <MaritimeSpanker> its so fucking rad
[5:34:16] <%Kevlar_Caviar> you cross it via some VERY precise horse jumps
[5:34:22] <darce_avidson> he's way deep in
[5:34:22] <%Kevlar_Caviar> took me a couple tries
[5:34:23] <Aussie_Manny> Ooooh, this place.
[5:34:23] <dan_g_v> or underground!
[5:34:26] <darce_avidson> after the second grace
[5:34:33] <MaritimeSpanker> also Blaidd COULD be before you go down here, up top somewhere
[5:34:37] <Big_Dream> i just cant get into elden ring like it doesn't hold my attention  maybe it's jsut not my type of game
[5:34:41] <asleepykitten1> @ape_hawk The sorcery tutor tells you that 'glitstone' is literally the stuff that makes up stars so yeah probably
[5:34:43] <%Brassnarwhal> @realthiele i appreciate that the numbering method gives us a more practical useful bit of info, but it's so dry i miss the hero souls
[5:34:51] <lockhead45> he said he was going to the Mistwood so maybe it's above at the elevator?
[5:35:02] <darce_avidson> i believe, if you open your map
[5:35:10] <Giztech> what armor set is that?
[5:35:12] <Fluffyowner> how many hours is pat in?
[5:35:17] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> he is near the sacred deer
[5:35:24] <dan_g_v> Pat is just 72 hours in
[5:35:26] <+Freakin_Wolfy> which halberd is that?
[5:35:28] <Fluffyowner> ooo
[5:35:28] <darce_avidson> he should be left of the dead end bridge roughly
[5:35:33] <darce_avidson> right at its' start
[5:35:44] <%Brassnarwhal> @justtheguyyouneed hey that's just the guy we needed psa1guy
[5:35:45] <robert_orri> @PatStaresAt I was super confused about this side quest too, turns out you have to complete the great runes of the academy and the red hellzone before you can continue it
[5:35:53] <%SirGO0SE> @PatStaresAt do you miss the corpse runs at all? so far it feels like theyve really done away with them between the horse and the very forgiving bonfires
[5:35:59] <%DrBunni> Pat does this game meet or exceed expectations?
[5:36:05] <darce_avidson> left along the cliffside
[5:36:13] <darce_avidson> from the temple
[5:36:14] <darce_avidson> iirc
[5:36:14] <asleepykitten1> This area is gorgeous
[5:36:18] <Aussie_Manny> Somewhere significant.
[5:36:26] <darce_avidson> if he isn't in one of the other dozen spots he's in
[5:36:26] <%Aeogard> @SirGO0SE there's still plenty of boss runs ive experienced here, dont worry haha
[5:36:28] <%Brassnarwhal> @sirgo0se corpse runs still happen in legacy dungeons and mini dungeons
[5:36:30] <Aussie_Manny> Haha, ya dumb glowing deer.
[5:36:49] <robert_orri> damn, guess I heard wrong
[5:36:51] <%OrangeMDT> Ok, maybe having reviewers get this 4 days early was not the best

[5:44:02] <%greasypete00> @Bane_Kaikyo he maybe may have slightly killed her
[5:44:04] <MaritimeSpanker> @Bane_Kaikyo because when nobody knew what to do there, pat struck her and she grew aggro

[5:44:55] <%PartyFavors> blender

[5:48:25] <%Brassnarwhal> hit those exterior walls hard, especially north of the church of vows along the lake edge
[5:48:34] <TheDeimion> I've heard that the weird guy in storm veil works like a rune piggy bank; when you die a bunch of your runes are "stolen" by him and to get them back you kill him

[5:52:39] <%Brassnarwhal> so do you guys think that the underground map matches the size of the overworld map?
[5:53:16] <+KingKrampus> every time I come back in the stream, I'm like "This is what  Skyrim should have been from the start"
[5:53:26] <BreakfastSampler> @Brassnarwhal In explorable area? probably not. But it's probably got tunnels and such that connect areas
[5:53:29] <Heyestus> Is that pot special?

[5:53:36] <Aussie_Manny> Larval Tear! PogChamp

[5:53:52] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt I know you like the Ranni-gang but how does the fact that the finger-facehugger monsters are in the crew modify that opinion?
[5:54:05] <Aussie_Manny> Does this game do the nice thing I like where it clears map markers once you reach it?

[6:02:00] <shotgang86> the turtle pope is talking to a skeleton man
[6:02:01] <fatalDestiny> I feel like he talks too fast for a turtle, every other character takes ages to say anything, but he's moving quite quick, for a turtle.
[6:02:02] <skagtheprinceofhell> @sirgo0se Less evil though.

[6:20:58] <atomizedstream> @patstaresat they are usually things yes
[6:21:00] <%thbluewarden> beg pardon?
[6:21:02] <penitentpendant> @KingKrampus Yup. And Giant Hat Snape was vague, just saying 'go do it.'
[6:21:02] <+SaintSalted> the mines

[6:21:23] <+SaintSalted> they're the mines @patstaresat
[6:21:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> he sleep
[6:21:24] <Heyestus> He snooze
[6:21:24] <XxMoliciousxX> does the game keep track of days passed?
[6:21:28] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt red circles are mines where you can get a shit tone of smithing stones
[6:21:32] <+MoonObscure> awww sleeeping
[6:21:34] <senfood> Awww sleeping Turtle Pope.
[6:21:42] <razieltano123> @PatStaresAt Undo the PS5 save shenanigans when you can.

[6:21:45] <+Rellim80> No. It's a Skenis.
[6:21:50] <+KratzTv89> the black spots on map are mine they are awsome you should do one
[6:21:54] <+Shimano232> weird... im not sure why it's not triggering
[6:22:09] <thesaverofhumens> what is he trying to do?
[6:22:10] <ExpressNode> You see all the bloodstains though so it must be something
[6:22:12] <Gray_LoFi> I mean there're like a dozen bloodstains so there's *something*
[6:22:14] <+Shimano232> another boss like before
[6:22:19] <%tusk102> ?
[6:22:19] <+Shimano232> I fought him myself earlier
[6:22:20] <convo445> maybe the turtle still has spells to sell
[6:22:22] <%tusk102> huh
[6:22:24] <Sigma_190_Beta> I think there's supposed to be a boss.
[6:22:24] <+hakumaribo> yea hthe bloodstains are a dead giveaway that some shit goes down
[6:22:27] <razieltano123> outside
[6:22:27] <senfood> I've only know Turtle Pope for an hour but if anything were to happen to him I'd kill everyone in this room and then myself.
[6:22:33] <%tusk102> weird
[6:22:37] <penitentpendant> Perhaps later, when more sidequests are done?
[6:22:43] <thesaverofhumens> a boss here seems bad, wouldn't  turtle pope get hit?
[6:22:44] <Rbeatononefour> maybe the turtle's just tougher than he looks
[6:22:48] <darce_avidson> it's the warmaster's shack boss
[6:22:48] <+KingKrampus> @senfood we all would
[6:22:54] <XxMoliciousxX> did exhaust turtle dialog?
[6:22:54] <convo445> maybe haven't progressed the story enough
[6:22:55] <darce_avidson> so if you killed him there
[6:22:58] <+Shimano232> turtle pope disappears
[6:22:58] <%tusk102> there was
[6:23:00] <darce_avidson> he won't be here
[6:23:05] <+Shimano232> he comes back after though
[6:23:05] <+ELevelsUp> for most night time location bosses, you have to approach from a different grace
[6:23:15] <Ahack13> those both had them
[6:23:31] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah, I can see the red icon on my map at Morne Tunnel right now, Pat
[6:23:35] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt can confirm them to be mines, they have a shit ton of smithing stones. they ramp up in which stones you get based on the zone
[6:23:37] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Chat how do you guys find this stuff out lol
[6:23:44] <TheDeimion> time to find grass closeby
[6:24:21] <Ahack13> The mines you just marked gives you a thing to buy smith stones 1 and 2

[6:53:00] <senfood> Some sort of cave demon
[6:53:00] <Ell1ot> the mud crabs from skyrim
[6:53:00] <ape_hawk> like, in ds1 days?
[6:53:02] <paperplanerr1> that message better say Time for crab
[6:53:05] <%Solarint> @Solarint ugh I hated that about skyrim, I strongly preferred it when each level was unique and tightly designed, this looks a bit dull
[6:53:05] <ExpressNode> You could say we lost "faith"
[6:53:08] <theanora1> undead crabs?
[6:53:10] <%twohitgood> in 1.0 DS2
[6:53:11] <marvel877> CRAB BATTLE
[6:53:13] <%Niney_Who> DS2 it was good until it got nerfed
[6:53:16] <%gitgouda> ds2 before it was nerfed.
[6:53:17] <penitentpendant> Temporarily in DS2 before the patch
[6:53:27] <%scarman125> lightning spear still seems to suck so did they really?
[6:53:29] <digaogrunge> DS2 no patch
[6:53:31] <Ner234> LUL Plague just released part 0 of his Elden Ring playthrough and it's just an hour and thirty of character creation LUL
[6:53:31] <toulon_somberjade> And they did it by merging it with pyromancy
[6:53:31] <Parapattern> For like one week in DS1 it was massively overpowered
[6:53:36] <%SirGO0SE> etalCrab
[6:53:38] <Omenaire_> CRAB 🦀
[6:53:38] <VioletBeat> GIANT ENEMY CRAB

[6:54:20] <ergulor> double crab
[6:54:20] <%Danitaras> didn't whoolie make a miracle man which was nerfed in oblivion the next day?
[6:54:22] <%Piemen99> How the fuck did crabs get down here?
[6:54:28] <%twohitgood> i wonder if the visceral opportunity still is there when the crab lifts up both claws for the slam?
[6:54:30] <%Warstar696> Fun fact: all of the giant crabs are male.
[6:54:41] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @Deft_Thought why not crab?
[6:54:49] <luciluxlu0> puzzle
[6:54:51] <TheBadonkulator> nobody knows how those crabs get up in there yknow
[6:54:55] <+KingKrampus> @warstar696 how do you know that
[6:54:59] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought Excellent point
[6:55:00] <%Neryl_> The most metal boss fight of all.
[6:55:01] <%FacetiousAF> is this the exit???
[6:55:01] <+BoboDaHobo> when you give up we can tell you what to do
[6:55:07] <%Solarint> @Piemen99 doesn't look like theres any way, whoever made it didn't think of that...
[6:55:19] <%SirGO0SE> imagine if in 6 months we find out this game has more hidden walls than all the other souls games combined?
[6:55:21] <thesaverofhumens> do a little dance
[6:55:23] <G_476> what was that long message?
[6:55:25] <%Warstar696> @KingKrampus find an image that shows exactly what crab genitalia look like.
[6:55:25] <Omenaire_> imagine how many illusionary walls are going to go undetected
[6:55:38] <ergulor> invisible floor then
[6:55:48] <thesaverofhumens> the floor is lava
[6:55:55] <+KingKrampus> @warstar696 are you secretly Plague of Gripes
[6:55:57] <Ahack13> use the trap blades as elevators
[6:56:02] <%pinkslimegoblin> I got stuck here for like 10 minutes
[6:56:13] <penitentpendant> Arc vs Line
[6:56:16] <%Niney_Who> Crab genitalia looks like medical equipment
[6:56:18] <%justcallmebobplease> Invisible dungeone - the whole thing, invisible.  And if you try to make it visible, you get aggro.
[6:56:19] <%TaurusOxford> He has the high ground!!!
[6:56:23] <%Warstar696> @KingKrampus no, I lived in Louisiana for quite a few years, spent a lot of time crabbing.

[7:03:33] <ape_hawk> theres a disturbing amount of oleg rn
[7:03:37] <%SirGO0SE> i get the feeling those skeletons can hit you if you get to close
[7:03:38] <%cade_calrayn> Now you can understand how these guys killed a god
[7:03:40] <TheDeimion> is it even possible to parry him without dying from a combo
[7:03:40] <ape_hawk> lack*
[7:03:44] <Aussie_Manny> I wonder if they can still hit you.
[7:03:44] <%SirGO0SE> oh god theyre firing in

[7:04:40] <Ahack13> you should be able to summon D for this fight
[7:04:40] <+KingKrampus> IT'S BLOOD
[7:04:41] <Aussie_Manny> It's enough to make a man sick!
[7:04:41] <ohno58> That's a Sekiro boss in a souls game.
[7:04:42] <%twohitgood> all that blood and yet his blade is still thirsty.
[7:04:45] <TheotherKristian> That's a lotta damage++

[7:04:59] <STORMWIZARD1> what about your new weapons? @PatStaresAt
[7:05:01] <TheDeimion> doggos would slow 'em down
[7:05:03] <digaogrunge> Swap your ashes

[7:05:07] <penitentpendant> Oleg: "I ain't no Bloodborne."
[7:05:09] <%Warstar696> @ohno58 more like a Bloodborne super enemy disguised as a normal enemy
[7:05:10] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Claymore was boss tho
[7:05:11] <Aussie_Manny> No. Leave Jiren to me.
[7:05:13] <senfood> Oleg is NOT invited.

[7:07:05] <penitentpendant> He's good at his grab game
[7:07:08] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Claymore was doing work bro Pat
[7:07:09] <Parapattern> Doesn't seem like a poke weapon is the best tool for this boss
[7:07:09] <Sunstalker> @SirGO0SE Pat could equip his lantern
[7:07:14] <+GenesysCreed> skeleton coming for that booty
[7:07:15] <TheDeimion> ok he's doable tho you just gotta ... monkaS
[7:07:19] <KasiCrafter> Is the wonderous physic helping any?
[7:07:22] <%SirGO0SE> in the first encounter with this guy i had the torch on yeah @Sunstalker
[7:07:27] <Aussie_Manny> This is another unorthodox boss fight. I like it.
[7:07:27] <penitentpendant> But why? It's not dark.
[7:07:27] <jubejube56> Yknow the second he beats this boss those skeletons are gonna run in and smack him
[7:07:30] <xerotwo> CALL AN AMBULANCE!!! BUT NOT FOR ME LUL

[7:07:38] <Aussie_Manny> Close quarters. VERY agile enemy.
[7:07:40] <$vehementvadr> are there 2 black knife assassins bosses in these catacombs?
[7:08:03] <%CryoByjorne> Pat have you tried hiting r2 right after a block?

[7:08:46] <Aussie_Manny> But trying to get behind Rashid here is gonna be tough.
[7:08:48] <Rbeatononefour> for a sec i thought he'd never get stunned
[7:08:59] <+oneimportantthing> They just dumped a Sekiro boss with Sekiro speed into a Souls game with Souls speed lol

[7:09:21] <penitentpendant> The grab has all the frames

[7:29:37] <%Warstar696> Grass status: touched
[7:29:37] <%pinkslimegoblin> this game would be much more annoying with durability
[7:29:39] <peachy996> oh no
[7:29:49] <42nfl19> wtf is @PatStaresAt wearing? Is he still going for that paladin build? Armor looks like tats, its pretty cool

[7:30:41] <%SWFanatic> nice dmg
[7:30:44] <rommlll> time for good rocks
[7:30:44] <+tempestzephyr> imagine if there was an explosive chest that blew up on hit lol
