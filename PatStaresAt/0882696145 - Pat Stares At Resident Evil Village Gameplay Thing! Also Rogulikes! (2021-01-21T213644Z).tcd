[0:48:39] <+HitchhikingThrough> NO PAT IT IS A GREAT IDEA ignore the part where it's not please thanks
[0:48:40] <+king_of_beggars> It generates hype for clickbait Kotaku titles about how people couldn't download the demo.

[1:52:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Prediction: This demo is going to end with "the maiden" being turned into a vampire. And then she'll be an enemy you can kill in the full game and it'll be a cool moment for those that played the demo.

[1:52:19] <%Mekhet09> There'll be ammo in that empty drawer in the main game.

[1:59:43] <marshalmorphino22> That was pretty good
[1:59:43] <$Falilth> the game is out in may even
[1:59:44] <+Basilias_Maximus> @PatStaresAt She was in the main room, upstairs by the eye door.
[1:59:45] <+Killjoyreign> That was a whole lotta woman
[1:59:48] <peachy996> No shorter than the RE7 one

[1:59:54] <%Persona_EX> are we doing that again?
[1:59:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I think The Maiden is one of the vampires.
[1:59:55] <+gustavozxd> the RE7 demo was more interesting
[1:59:55] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Are you gonna go look for the dummy fingers and all that?
[1:59:56] <GUNxSPECTRE> Why does Pat look like he's wearing fishnets
[1:59:56] <+GenesisKnight> Was Umbrella around in the 1950s

[1:59:58] <%dekkitout> Or was dead but got better
[2:00:00] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Potentially the blonde vampire.
[2:00:00] <+AlphaRayAllen> Dead or "dead"
[2:00:02] <+skeletrail> Modern boltcutters
[2:00:03] <%MonkeyTimelord> More like Day-um-walker.
[2:00:03] <%cosmicgoatee> it's not Mia...I mean maybe?
[2:00:05] <%YakumoYomi> Alright, Capcom. I like where you're going with this
[2:00:05] <jeffishype> remember how much better the re2 demo was then this
[2:00:05] <rytisone> I wonder if Mia is one of the maidens
[2:00:06] <wannabemoogle> Are we playing a girl?
[2:00:06] <%chiazam> WE'LL PROBABLY GET A NOTE
[2:00:07] <%Alig200> Maiden seems to be one of the "livestock" they probably keep around for blood.
[2:00:08] <%GarbageNirvana> Could be one of the daughters maybe
[2:00:11] <%Monkeyweed21> Vampire progenitors aren't weak to sunlight like those they turn

[2:15:23] <peachy996> What about Racist Dolphins
[2:15:23] <%GarbageNirvana> dogs also pick up on social keys from humans so sometimes a race is trainer can make a racist dog
