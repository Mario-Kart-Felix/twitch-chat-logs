[0:22:18] <+Number_Last> It's NTalRight

[0:34:37] <+NYCrownlessKing> wait you know how to do your job? @AngriestPat Kappa
[0:34:38] <Forester_Skippy> i do that every weekend
[0:34:38] <CatYamHD> yeah
[0:34:38] <mercado94> maybe
[0:34:38] <CronoMagnum> Yes, but that's my life
[0:34:40] <Kaurisen> no
[0:34:40] <+Frubblord> yes
[0:34:42] <%spacekataz18> Sort of
[0:34:42] <+nolifegamin> @Setsuna_seiei we'll see, good part of my group are pretty new too but we really get into the RP idk if that's too intense for u lol
[0:34:42] <msshakedown> All the time. Even after 1-2 days from being away sick.
[0:34:43] <Kaurisen> wait yes
[0:34:44] <+Pendlez> what the fuck is a job
[0:34:44] <Gameslayer2> Ive never had a job so i dont know Kappa
[0:34:44] <%SSaryn> I mean.. probably.
[0:34:45] <FriendlyPatches> I'm having that right now
[0:34:45] <unlimited_osteopath> not at all. I am entirely aware of how to do my job at all times
[0:34:47] <%TheHypestCripple> it is
[0:34:47] <%Remery_> Yea I almost burned my face! :D
[0:34:48] <+byeblackbird> I forget how to be a human sometimes
[0:34:50] <donny_pandairaz> The fuck is a vacation?
[0:34:51] <+Skatedeandre> You’re fucked
[0:34:51] <+JenovasPuppet> Don't worry, Pat. Your shirt makes up for all your mistakes.
[0:34:53] <Jericu> that's basically school, right?
[0:34:53] <Austin0097> It's a similar feeling to coming back to school after summer break.
[0:34:54] <powerprotoman> same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was
[0:34:54] <admiralsatan> plot twist: you never knew how to do your job in the first place
[0:34:55] <crimsonharvest> Pat if you forgot how to stream it time to learn to sing like Stan Rogers
[0:34:58] <ConLin_Plays> what is the problem?
[0:34:58] <%jiin6> Pat lose mind?
[0:34:58] <%mordred_t> Just open up that Lucha folder on stream. I'm sure it has the answers.
[0:35:00] <+Verd_254> What is this vacation you speak of? Seems nice.
[0:35:03] <Jericu> Bounce for 3 months, come back having forgotten EVERYTHING
[0:35:04] <+nolifegamin> What job? LUL
[0:35:04] <@BigNaturalMan59> rofl pooh bear
[0:35:05] <%HiroTSK5> @AngriestPat No, but that's because I literally quit my last job to avoid that scenario instead of asking for time off.
[0:35:11] <Isord> You can't forget if you never know how to do your job in the first place
[0:35:13] <unlimited_osteopath> is this the 1-hour pre-stream existential crisis??
[0:35:18] <Setsuna_seiei> @nolifegamin too intense is if i play something i dont like. Otherwise its something i'd have to feel out. Like i said never played a DnD game lol.
[0:35:20] <ConLin_Plays> oh yeah, don't burn out Pat
[0:35:21] <%SSaryn> Oh noooooo
[0:35:25] <+KoyaMusa> ah, content

[0:36:00] <+HelloImTom08> why is his screen so bright
[0:36:01] <+Skatedeandre> It’s okay pat at this point we don’t expect anything less :)
[0:36:01] <tighearnachcreag> sorry to keep spamming, but @AngriestPat what are your PC specs? All I can find online are out of date specs from the SBF wiki's page on you.
[0:36:02] <%SSaryn> Oh boi they are.

[0:43:04] <Rngiddion> wow
[0:43:04] <+UberWolfman> NUFF
[0:43:04] <brosuke1> They improved it in 4.3
[0:43:06] <Metballs> Ok, I got REALLY confused because I didn't realise it was 4.2
[0:43:06] <+HelloImTom08> nobody does it
[0:43:06] <inksmears> you can't even mash through them even! everyone watches at the same pace
[0:43:06] <+UberWolfman> NERF
[0:43:07] <+KoyaMusa> It was a terrible decision, people don't do it nearly as much now
[0:43:07] <+JenovasPuppet> 4.3 adding tons of tomestones to MSQ Roulette.
[0:43:09] <JamvaanPS4> Good for leveling, bad for EVERYTHING else.
[0:43:09] <DrakeSilvos> They raised the bonus even higher in 4.3
[0:43:10] <%spacekataz18> Hahahaha
[0:43:12] <DarkSkyKing> I havent done it since
[0:43:12] <rosemon5001> @CatmanIX thnx now to open a link to watch after the strim
[0:43:13] <Forester_Skippy> 200 peotics pat enjoy
[0:43:14] <%spacekataz18> Yeap
[0:43:15] <inksmears> in 4.3 you can get 50 current tomestones tho!!!
[0:43:16] <+Felto3> you have to quit and relog to skip them
[0:43:18] <+Ilpala271> they sure fuckin tried
[0:43:19] <Metballs> It's not bad in 4.3 now
[0:43:20] <unlimited_osteopath> Make sure to dark arts those cutscenes
[0:43:22] <%GrandMasterSpam> Yeah, they killed the MSQ roulette with that change.
[0:43:22] <AzureDusk> @AngriestPat Pat did you see the train wreck of the new Thunder Cats show
[0:43:22] <%Dansen182> Tomestones will be worth in 4.3
[0:43:24] <Luiz8000> It gives like 2 mil EXP and 300-400 poetics
[0:43:25] <suikudo> they went back and undid the skipable cutscenes now no one will ever do those
[0:43:25] <%TheBroletariat> It gives about a full level of exp at 60+
[0:43:27] <JamvaanPS4> It's about 2mil Xp so it's not the worst
[0:43:27] <Metballs> I won't do it, but it's not that bad
[0:43:35] <birchpeninsula> Tomes will absolutely not be worth in 4.3
[0:43:38] <Setsuna_seiei> @nolifegamin im off to actually make progress on PoE feel free to hmu on discord at BlackLuster#8511
[0:43:38] <+Felto3> its still quicker to log out and log in again
[0:43:41] <+Xanax44> The XP you get for MS roulette is nuts if you can live through the cutscene
[0:43:46] <unlimited_osteopath> yeah those areas could be done solo at this point, provided you're at the right ilvl
[0:43:47] <CybertronPrime> No more impatient assholes ruining Castrum and Praetorium for new players. I approve.
[0:43:49] <ErikQRoks> PJSalt PJSalt <3
[0:43:51] <%SSaryn> Mhmm.
[0:43:53] <%SSaryn> 2 Mil.
[0:43:54] <%TheBroletariat> Nah, its actually pretty chill in there now
[0:43:55] <%SSaryn> At least.
[0:43:56] <+KoyaMusa> Cape Westwind isn't part of that roulette
[0:44:00] <inksmears> yeah the exp is crazy
[0:44:01] <Forester_Skippy> cape westwind is a trai ltho no a msq dungeon @AngriestPat
[0:44:02] <+JenovasPuppet> I think Cape Westwind is on Trials now.
[0:44:02] <Metballs> Well, it scales
[0:44:02] <+Ryuartyi_> That's crazy
[0:44:04] <inksmears> so it's kind of worth it
[0:44:07] <+hobojo153> Dat's a lot of mon
[0:44:08] <+HelloImTom08> nobody bails, everyone knows what they singed up for. chat is usually lively and fun
[0:44:08] <suikudo> Sure but if you have everything at max level its worthless

[1:08:10] <%bumbletroni> Pat just brought me back in to ffxiv

[1:08:19] <hypoid77> haha doody
[1:08:19] <+rosetherosiest> duty recorder is weird
[1:08:21] <%wunderkindest> Viewing a doody
[1:08:21] <%SSaryn> Mhmm. It's not great actually.
[1:08:22] <inksmears> can only use it in one duty tho
[1:08:22] <%AbnormalVoid> haha doody
[1:08:23] <$AzureGale> heh, doodie recorder
[1:08:23] <IminyourBase> you seem like the kind of guy to record his doodies
[1:08:24] <%Remery_> doody
[1:08:25] <birchpeninsula> Duty Recorder is a wasre
[1:08:27] <Forester_Skippy> @AngriestPat its not class specific but you can amcro it to a job change so you glam that on what that job is curently wearing
[1:08:28] <+NWR_James> doody
[1:08:28] <+hobojo153> Interesting...
[1:08:36] <inksmears> they changed it from byakko to sigmascape 4.0 in the new patch
[1:08:39] <inksmears> it's weird
[1:08:51] <brosuke1> i love duty recorder for one primal per patch kappa
[1:09:04] <%Mr_y1096> fuckin Jimmy
[1:09:07] <%Remery_> No now they will know :(
[1:09:09] <GurrenPrime> thats a really neat feature
[1:09:11] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Jimmy's never made any mistakes, you bastard
[1:09:14] <%jiin6> it was Pat all along
[1:09:17] <lilybergo> LUL
[1:09:17] <+Pendlez> or you could just blame the DRG like a normal person
[1:09:23] <$Yakobro> no
[1:09:27] <inksmears> no
[1:09:28] <Foggysheep> nope
[1:09:28] <Forester_Skippy> i cant wait till next patch to tell jimmy that in his guestbook
[1:09:28] <+rosetherosiest> if only
[1:09:30] <DrakeSilvos> Nope
[1:09:31] <$Yakobro> it's a portable bank
[1:09:32] <@BigNaturalMan59> it was me?!?!
[1:09:32] <ae_moth> you can't craft from the saddlebag, but it's still wicked good
[1:09:35] <milequetoaster> Everyone needs to agree to be recorded so if Jimmy doesn't want to be btfo he can just say no
[1:09:36] <+HelloImTom08> nope, its just a dye and bait bag
[1:09:39] <+rosetherosiest> they should add crafting from retainers tbh
[1:09:43] <%SSaryn> Pretty much.
[1:09:44] <+hobojo153> I use it to store crafting materials.
[1:09:44] <IminyourBase> OH MORE INVENTORY SPACE THANKS AFTER LIKE 5 YEARS
[1:09:45] <dontfeedthechocobo> chocobo knight must be a class
[1:09:46] <brosuke1> pretty much
[1:09:51] <%MisterCrimson> @Pendlez Jimmie is the DRG
[1:09:52] <ae_moth> throw your cracked clusters and raid tokens into it
[1:09:52] <+CarpeBedlam> Is this the FF that's like a road trip?
[1:09:53] <DrakeSilvos> Can't access it in duties.

[1:10:05] <milequetoaster> It let's you hold 3 Maps so /shrug
[1:10:13] <og_lunchbox> Saddle bags are basically just my tackle box for fishing.
[1:10:13] <+hobojo153> @CarpeBedlam That's 15. This is 14, the MMO
[1:10:18] <%TheBroletariat> Undo sort is the fucking best
[1:10:23] <%elementofloyalty> @AngriestPat Did you Kill Paige finally?
[1:10:26] <%TheBroletariat> I've hit sort on accident so many times
[1:10:29] <+Ryuartyi_> You can have three for free now?
[1:10:37] <KTDelgado> pat you need to go bald, your age is showing
[1:10:37] <+CarpeBedlam> @hobojo153 SeemsGood
[1:10:45] <+JenovasPuppet> Can't access saddlebag in duties
[1:10:45] <%elementofloyalty> :D Is this a game?
[1:11:00] <milequetoaster> It magnets super hard now
[1:11:14] <GurrenPrime> .... 98 and 99?
[1:11:16] <GurrenPrime> jesus
[1:11:17] <unlimited_osteopath> it was adjusted for religious reasons
[1:11:19] <+hobojo153> Could they not before?
[1:11:23] <milequetoaster> wich kinda sucks if you just teleport using the menu
[1:11:26] <prime_name> Hah, Dooty
[1:11:39] <%elementofloyalty> apatWink - Can you stop rambling,I'm trying to sleep
[1:11:40] <ScrapSentinel> :)
[1:12:03] <$AzureGale> What is a "What The" event?
[1:12:13] <+Ilpala271> so you get to just have regular zone music when grinding shit
[1:12:32] <%elementofloyalty> Patch 4.2 Notes
[1:12:36] <%SSaryn> Woolie would
[1:12:37] <$Yakobro> 🤢
[1:12:39] <+NWR_James> puke
[1:12:39] <+hobojo153> SO. MUCH. TEXT,
[1:12:42] <%bumbletroni> moon2P moon2P moon2P
[1:12:46] <Jericu> look at all this garbage
[1:12:50] <%elementofloyalty> Reading is gey
[1:12:58] <KingKodiakVA> I. See. EVERYTHING!
[1:12:59] <CatmanIX> many item
[1:13:01] <Asuxley> I threw up
[1:13:06] <milequetoaster> Slothskin 👀
[1:13:07] <%jiin6> You read it
[1:13:08] <ae_moth> normal battle music won't play
[1:13:13] <%elementofloyalty> I'm suing for MOTION SICKNESS
[1:13:15] <@thenefftw> !recipe
[1:13:15] <%SSaryn> Specifically for Field running.
[1:13:15] <@Moobot> THAT'S IT! http://bit.ly/2iKTj5v
[1:13:17] <IminyourBase> say the line!
[1:13:18] <%Fenrirlives> THAT'S IT
[1:13:19] <%SpcOpsBear> Basically, any time you would have music play for fighting for NORMAL FIGHTS, it's turned off
[1:13:19] <ae_moth> it'll be like Azys La
[1:13:22] <%bumbletroni> It's probably so that you can keep hearing the regular music when going through open areas
[1:13:24] <%jiin6> Some one say Recipeh?
[1:13:25] <%OdysseyKnight> Battle music won't kick on when something aggros you in the field
[1:13:25] <+Felto3> you can set it so its always zone music, no battle music
[1:13:28] <@CreepyPorpoise> Battle music wont interrupt your field music
[1:13:29] <Metballs> Basically unless you start a fight the music won't kick in if you're just passing through
[1:13:30] <CatmanIX> much recipe
[1:13:32] <%GummiBunnies> wait, why are we on incognito mode?
[1:13:33] <+hobojo153> So like if you're running through an area with higher level hostile enemies, it won't interrupt the music.
[1:13:38] <%elementofloyalty> EAT THE MIC PAT
[1:13:39] <Cpt_phantom> `sorta like how you can turn off mount music
[1:13:41] <%SpcOpsBear> FATE fights and stuff will still play music
[1:13:49] <ae_moth> 4.3 hyyyyyyyyyype
[1:13:55] <$Yakobro> BI GPISS
[1:13:59] <%Remery_> Just pee?
[1:14:02] <Jericu> @GummiBunnies so the bookmarks aren't shown
[1:14:04] <Isord> 2 seconds have passed already
[1:14:06] <DrakeSilvos> 1, 2
[1:14:06] <Captain_Joe1911> notekMilk CurseLit
[1:14:07] <%bumbletroni> It's been 2 seconds
[1:14:07] <$AzureGale> Wow, Pat can pee in two seconds?

[1:16:43] <+roxikat> @hobojo153 It was so stressful. ;_;
[1:17:02] <ae_moth> eureka is fucking garbage
[1:17:07] <%elementofloyalty> Euerka's Castle?
[1:17:17] <+hobojo153> @roxikat Being the healer usually is.
[1:17:17] <CybertronPrime> Eureka is trash.
[1:17:26] <brosuke1> WELCOME TO EUREKA
[1:17:29] <unlimited_osteopath> Eureka is fiiiine, it's just a mini version of FFXI
[1:17:30] <Metballs> Eureka made me quit for a patch
[1:17:31] <%spacekataz18> Eureka is a grind
[1:17:32] <+S14y3d> i liked eureka :(
[1:17:35] <@JustinianKnight> Eureka is good, just need adjusting
[1:17:37] <%elementofloyalty> This is Eureka
[1:17:41] <%spacekataz18> I done my part, I got my feathers
[1:17:41] <CybertronPrime> And XI is grindy nonsense.
[1:17:46] <+CosmicGuitars> it's very bad
[1:17:56] <milequetoaster> It's pretty chill
[1:17:57] <Kongro_> It is not very bad
[1:17:57] <+bbHighvalor> its bad
[1:17:58] <+Felto3> it took then A FUCKING YEAR to add 20 fates
[1:18:00] <%elementofloyalty> Beer cheers Pat
[1:18:02] <brosuke1> Eureka is easy, just follow the fate train
[1:18:03] <+hobojo153> So FF11 is just part of 14 now?
[1:18:04] <ae_moth> you go to Eureka, afk for 20 minutes waiting for big monsters to spawn
[1:18:04] <Shinjima> its not, its worse than ff11
[1:18:08] <Kongro_> It was very chill fun with friends
[1:18:09] <%bumbletroni> Kagome
[1:18:11] <+HelloImTom08> its so boring i didnt botther with it ResidentSleeper
[1:18:17] <%elementofloyalty> INNUYASHA
[1:18:17] <Kongro_> If you do it solo, it's boring
[1:18:18] <+superkeaton> Pat help, my friend who works at a tv studio had to cut off a hockey game to give a thunderstorm warning and now all the angery canadians are calling in
[1:18:18] <%spacekataz18> It's big grind
[1:18:19] <unlimited_osteopath> to be fair, it's good that it's instanced. It's basically a quarantine zone for all that liked XI
[1:18:31] <+CosmicGuitars> lol
[1:18:33] <%XzileGaming> this patch notes game is enthralling
[1:18:44] <@CreepyPorpoise> You only de-level if you dont get raised
[1:18:45] <+JenovasPuppet> @Shinjima It's closer to what XI was when it first came out.
[1:18:46] <@JustinianKnight> you are raised almost all the time tho
[1:18:47] <fimbulvetr27> Eureka in a nutshell: "When is Paz up?" "lfg NM train" "Where the fuck's the magicite?" "Why don't people reas quest text?"
[1:18:49] <+Felto3> theres 20 fates, thats it
[1:18:51] <JamvaanPS4> To a point, like said it's FFXI light.
[1:18:54] <%elementofloyalty> Ma Gi cite
[1:19:00] <+NickyDynamite> It's boring xi and basically ride a fate train
[1:19:02] <Shinjima> its NOT FFXI, you dont get exp from NMs in 11
[1:19:07] <%SGrim> Rock, paper, magicite LUL
[1:19:10] <unlimited_osteopath> yeah but the nostalgia, guyzzzz
[1:19:15] <unlimited_osteopath> don't you enjoy the nostalgia??
[1:19:19] <%elementofloyalty> "I choose you magicite"!
[1:19:23] <+hobojo153> I never played 11
[1:19:30] <+TheShal> POKEMON
[1:19:37] <unlimited_osteopath> don't you like your basic-ass-lookin scorpion harness?
[1:19:42] <+chiluzza> This is pokemon level shit
[1:19:45] <ae_moth> eureka's biggest problem is there's nothign to do inbetween grinding normal mobs and waiting around for the Notorius Monsters
[1:19:57] <+HannibalBeerus> Pat's having the big trouble with this pokemon
[1:20:04] <$AzureGale> I thought they were trying to stay away from elemental rock-paper-scissors
[1:20:09] <%elementofloyalty> @AngriestPat did Shelmo finally move out and get a place with Steve Buschelmo?
[1:20:12] <milequetoaster> you mean there's nothing to do besides what there is to do?
[1:20:16] <Shinjima> eureka = ff14 fate grind inside an instance
[1:20:17] <+KoyaMusa> its simple
[1:20:19] <Metballs> Basically if you're DPS go strong attack, Healer/Tank go same element
[1:20:19] <+Ilpala271> just get in and do it
[1:20:21] <unlimited_osteopath> the elemental thing isn't hard to figure out. The enemies tell you what they're weak to
[1:20:22] <%AbnormalVoid> JO Crystal, Protein Crystal
[1:20:26] <Metballs> It's garbage and takes no thought
[1:20:26] <%SGrim> @AngriestPat same affinity as enemy = reduced incoming damage from said enemy. apatPorgmo
[1:20:27] <%shin_garbage> i dont understand either pat
[1:20:31] <+hobojo153> Gary's in FF14 now?
[1:20:33] <+JenovasPuppet> It's doesn't matter. Just get carried by the train.
[1:20:44] <%shin_garbage> i dont play this game so all this is just fucking jargon that i cant understand
[1:20:44] <%SpcOpsBear> The simplest explanation: get into big parties inside Eureka to get tokens to make gear. Kill FATEs for the better crystals that let you get your +2 gear.
[1:21:00] <%elementofloyalty> DINO RIDE
[1:21:01] <JamvaanPS4> The XP chains don't matter at the end of the day. Notorious Mobs are really the only thing worth doing.
[1:21:02] <+NWR_James> BIG DINOS
[1:21:02] <samuraifriend> people that have done eureka still don't know what is happening
[1:21:06] <%OdysseyKnight> Is this anjanath?
[1:21:07] <%bumbletroni> Scary Monsters apatCrazy
[1:21:08] <lord_winter_555> that's an 11 lookin dino
[1:21:11] <iheartmota> Flying TREX!
[1:21:19] <dontfeedthechocobo> caladbolg PogChamp
[1:21:22] <%SpcOpsBear> Eureka in a nutshell: Kill lots of things. Watch your soul leave your body. Maybe get into a rave while waiting for the next NM to spawn?
[1:21:26] <%elementofloyalty> Jesus wishes he had a Flying Dino

[1:28:51] <%SpcOpsBear> "great"
[1:28:57] <firesonicz> We heard you want less dark arts so here's some dark arts
[1:29:10] <unlimited_osteopath> yeah DRK could use more dark arts
[1:29:34] <%elementofloyalty> Math?
[1:29:38] <milequetoaster> who the fuck would want less Dark Arts
[1:29:44] <unlimited_osteopath> yeah, who would??
[1:29:45] <%SSaryn> Mhmm. It's actually not SHIT.
[1:29:49] <%elementofloyalty> Mike Pence
[1:29:50] <Forester_Skippy> you jsut do that once i ngrit and then you have agro forever
[1:29:59] <unlimited_osteopath> make it so that you need to use dark arts before you get on grit or darkside
[1:30:14] <unlimited_osteopath> true, Grit should be FREE
[1:30:26] <%SSaryn> That recast time is not needed at all.
[1:30:30] <unlimited_osteopath> Dark Passenger actually somewhat useable now??
[1:30:32] <MelBrooksKA> How is the patch notes coming
[1:30:44] <%SSaryn> Think I heard 11 if I remember correctly.
[1:31:09] <bielzitcho> actually viable now PogChamp
[1:31:13] <TheImmortal70> But now it's got a longer timer
[1:31:16] <+HelloImTom08> DA plus passanger still costs a lot of mana tho...
[1:31:19] <TheImmortal70> SO you're gonna have less time to use it
[1:32:03] <Ell1ot> HI Pat!
[1:32:10] <Forester_Skippy> DA + DP costs half your bar total
[1:32:23] <+HelloImTom08> its like warriors ' vengence
[1:32:37] <%spacekataz18> Naw sentinel is right
[1:32:43] <%SSaryn> Why was this needed.
[1:32:45] <bielzitcho> that shadow wall buff is bretty gud
[1:32:46] <%SSaryn> Like actually.
[1:32:51] <LeeOhX> heyo pat boi, whats goin on here

[1:33:02] <Luiz8000> Its to help pull adds I think
[1:33:03] <+Xanax44> I want extra range for plunge cuz it sounds fun
[1:33:05] <TheImmortal70> The last one is good
[1:33:08] <Malziel> !uptime
[1:33:08] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 33m 16s.
[1:33:14] <ConLin_Plays> Gonna go to sleeps, have fun!
[1:33:23] <Lotharman> Next they will allow to Dark Arts Sprint.
[1:33:28] <Ell1ot> is this Pat's version of reading Sonic FanFic?
[1:33:30] <$AzureGale> Plunge is sticky? :o
[1:33:42] <unlimited_osteopath> by sticky he means it clips through shit
[1:33:42] <TheImmortal70> So now instead of unmend, you can jump in unleash to prevent any stragglers from hitting teammates, or you can dark arts it to increase dps if you have it.
[1:33:43] <%SSaryn> Plunging is very sticky, make sure you're prepared Kappa
[1:33:43] <Forester_Skippy> plunge is fun i used it to teleport with alexander
[1:34:28] <Forester_Skippy> @AngriestPat DA has a 2 second cooldown now
[1:34:56] <Ser_Randal> BOOOOOOOOO
[1:35:02] <Luiz8000> Dark Arts its a 140 potency on anything anyway
[1:35:09] <unlimited_osteopath> I use it cause it looks cool, and really, if you're not doing it cause it looks cool, are you really winning? Didn't think so.
[1:35:12] <%SSaryn> Dark Arts to your hearts content.
[1:35:13] <+HelloImTom08> you can probally skip you aggro combo on opener now
[1:35:13] <Ell1ot> I don't know what any of this means!
[1:35:29] <Garrison27> same
[1:35:33] <ragasquid> same
[1:35:35] <+HelloImTom08> 20%hp and mp every 130 second, seems good
[1:35:37] <Metballs> It went from worthless to use on cooldown
[1:35:40] <unlimited_osteopath> Living Dead continues to be shit.
[1:35:54] <%MisterCrimson> @Ell1ot it means that Dark Knight is better but still kinda trash.
[1:36:13] <%SSaryn> Like A12S
[1:36:15] <DrakeSilvos> Your healers will love you.
[1:36:16] <Forester_Skippy> its not a dead button in raid anymore
[1:36:19] <RaidenTheBloodEdge> UUUSE IT
[1:36:22] <rosemon5001> oh my god im watching the horse anime i just cant stop laughing
[1:36:36] <+HelloImTom08> I get to put it on my hotbar PogChamp
[1:36:37] <Luiz8000> Dark Knight was never trash, and now its actually pretty good, just not meta for speed killing
[1:37:02] <mercado94> @rosetherosiest its pretty good
[1:37:03] <Forester_Skippy> pop TBN + that forthat opening tankbuster and jsut keep dark artsing
[1:37:40] <+rosetherosiest> ?
[1:37:48] <%SSaryn> Why is Dark Arts not used for Enders only
[1:37:49] <%SSaryn> Seriously.
[1:37:51] <Metballs> Dark Arts is WAY too much
[1:37:56] <+natjen8> Yoshi p said he would rework next expansion
[1:37:57] <Metballs> It's between every fucking GCD
[1:37:58] <+natjen8> rework DRK
[1:37:59] <unlimited_osteopath> RIP Scourge
[1:37:59] <soliammurr> RIP Scourge

[1:38:25] <unlimited_osteopath> I meant, Dark Arts RIP Dark Arts Scourge
[1:38:30] <TheImmortal70> BIG DPS
[1:38:31] <TheImmortal70> BIGGER
[1:38:33] <Forester_Skippy> the fact you DA OGCs is weird
[1:38:37] <Metballs> This is the game
[1:38:39] <LeeOhX> cause pat likes numbers
[1:38:39] <+HelloImTom08> still not good enoug for SAM LUL
[1:38:40] <CybertronPrime> @ssaryn limesLUL
[1:38:40] <%Fidel_Castbro> Meditative Brotherhood is the Brotherhood the non-monk receive
[1:38:42] <+Kain5707> wait why did they buff sam?
[1:38:43] <+KoyaMusa> MERCIFUL EYES THE ENMITY REDUCER LOL
[1:38:46] <sounata> quality gameplay
[1:38:47] <lilybergo> "b u f f s"
[1:38:49] <AJusticeLemon> oh boy look at that difference in sam vs mnk FeelsBadMan
[1:38:56] <%SSaryn> Yep. Scholors and Summoners got some good QoL.
[1:39:00] <%Fidel_Castbro> Give more potency to SAM
[1:39:02] <DrakeSilvos> Much needed
[1:39:03] <CybertronPrime> BUFF SAM MORE. I wanna one-shot Primals.
[1:39:03] <TheImmortal70> Oh hey, ruin in heal form
[1:39:03] <inksmears> scholar ftw :D
[1:39:05] <%SSaryn> Same with Astro.
[1:39:06] <%Fidel_Castbro> SAM still garbage compared to Monk
[1:39:08] <$Yakobro> @AngriestPat the sch thing is so good, the hot heals for a little less if you use all the cd's but it actually casts
[1:39:09] <+HelloImTom08> SCH changes are good and bad, all my macros are fucked now
[1:39:17] <TheImmortal70> So now you can shoot people with instant heals
[1:39:18] <%SSaryn> LIGHTSPEED BOOOOOOI
[1:39:21] <%Fidel_Castbro> FeelsGoodMan
[1:39:25] <inksmears> can't use rouse with whispering dawn anymore but the instant cast is super worth it and it got a healing potency buff to make up for it
[1:39:26] <IminyourBase> oooooh how are they going to ruin summoners this time?
[1:39:31] <+HelloImTom08> ASTO Kreygasm LIGHTSPEED+GRAVITY
[1:39:32] <Forester_Skippy> go faster buff it harder -Yoshi P
[1:39:33] <%spacekataz18> WHM lillies continue to have no use
[1:39:38] <%jiin6> but no Math mage
[1:39:38] <+jkcclemens> no bamboozle stream ayyy lmao
[1:39:57] <%SSaryn> Gravity + LS basically better than Holy now.
[1:40:02] <ELuscious> THIS IS ALL GIBBERISH TO ME FeelsGoodMan FeelsAmazingMan 🚬
[1:40:12] <Metballs> Gravity doesn't have stunlock, though
[1:40:14] <+HelloImTom08> i mean no stun but its pretty good
[1:40:20] <Metballs> So Holy reminas way better
[1:40:24] <%SSaryn> Ahhhh true, Stuns.
[1:40:34] <%SSaryn> Effective more HP for tanks.
[1:40:37] <$AzureGale> I thought Elmo was attacking Pat for a moment there ;x
[1:40:46] <aslfrasle> Gotta cast Fast
[1:40:48] <+HelloImTom08> put its still gonna be hype AF PogChamp
[1:40:50] <Forester_Skippy> you also weave in assize with holy wich is the same aoe potency but doesnt have dmaage fallof
[1:40:58] <DrakeSilvos> I didn't even know you could do that.
[1:41:06] <%SSaryn> Man, Gravity + LS is gonna be real fun to use.
[1:41:15] <+KoyaMusa> More like new nidhogg
[1:41:23] <MelBrooksKA> How long does it take to get to 330?
[1:41:25] <damienlunas> aw nice I got here in time for the patch note reading
[1:41:28] <%spacekataz18> Swallowed a compass
[1:41:28] <unlimited_osteopath> whatever, man, dark arts 'n shit
[1:41:41] <%XzileGaming> !uptime
[1:41:41] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 41m 50s.
[1:41:44] <DrakeSilvos> Years overdue
[1:41:44] <%XzileGaming> holy shit
[1:41:50] <+HelloImTom08> probally a week @MelBrooksKA just do dailys
[1:41:50] <kitoudark> xD
[1:41:54] <Forester_Skippy> THESE CHANGES are SO GOOD
[1:41:56] <Metballs> It's pretty much the same, just with tokens
[1:42:16] <Metballs> Lets you work with Heaven I imagine
[1:42:33] <Luiz8000> If you grind creation you get 330 in a couple hours
[1:42:36] <%GarbageNirvana> !uptime
[1:42:36] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 42m 45s.
[1:42:47] <%GarbageNirvana> How's everyone liking this almost two-hour patch note stream so far
[1:43:04] <%spacekataz18> I'm diggin it
[1:43:05] <Metballs> 10/10
[1:43:08] <Metballs> It's why I'm here
[1:43:09] <LeeOhX> patch out the stream pls
[1:43:10] <Forester_Skippy> the weapon tokens from kefka
[1:43:16] <+HelloImTom08> I think pat got the most hype about the 999 stacking items
[1:43:26] <Kongro_> @GarbageNirvana I actually missed some things when I read them myself, so this has already been worth watching
[1:43:30] <Forester_Skippy> they still gonna fuck you over even with that
[1:43:36] <ELuscious> D:
[1:43:37] <@JustinianKnight> That's not what that is
[1:43:38] <@CreepyPorpoise> Thats not what thats for though
[1:43:39] <ELuscious> PATRICK@
[1:43:40] <%Remery_> :(
[1:43:41] <@JustinianKnight> that is still a problem
[1:43:44] <Forester_Skippy> write in their geustbook how they fucked up
[1:43:46] <bleugh> 2chest
[1:43:53] <@DreyfussFrost> That's not what that's talking about. That's talking about doing O7S before O5S or O6S and locking yourself out of that loot.
[1:43:53] <%SSaryn> Toxic Bitches be here.
[1:43:54] <Pritswalk> da woyst
[1:43:54] <%GarbageNirvana> It does help to have an in-depth examination, yeah
[1:44:01] <+superkeaton> T D: XIC
[1:44:01] <%SSaryn> FUCK THIS
[1:44:02] <+KoyaMusa> Oh the big bad
[1:44:02] <%MisterCrimson> here it comes
[1:44:07] <+JenovasPuppet> Dog Squad!
[1:44:10] <Forester_Skippy> hahahaha as a tank im dead inside fro mthis
[1:44:12] <$AzureGale> fucking fuck off, you fucking fuck
[1:44:13] <Metballs> Yeah, I don't like this
[1:44:13] <unlimited_osteopath> Greedy bitches only
[1:44:33] <%Fidel_Castbro> But I only play one class
[1:44:34] <Metballs> If you're not going to use your secondary, why even gear it?
[1:44:36] <+UberWolfman> Yeah no. fuck off
[1:44:38] <%Fidel_Castbro> so its bad for me
[1:44:42] <milequetoaster> Finally someone gets it
[1:44:45] <lilybergo> YESSS
[1:44:46] <+Kain5707> no fuck off
[1:44:47] <unlimited_osteopath> I specifically run tank so I can get my tank shit. Fortunately the new raid's gear looks like shit so I don't mind losing it to a filthy DPS
[1:44:48] <+HelloImTom08> yea but ppl only do dun scatih on alts because of roulette LUL
[1:44:49] <$Desmond_Vakarian> if you dont play the class you dont need the gear
[1:44:54] <+JenovasPuppet> PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[1:44:54] <ELuscious> fuck off fuck you SwiftRage
[1:44:57] <Ryo_no_Kage> But my tank gear, Pat! D:
[1:44:58] <fakemalegamer> THANK YOU PAT
[1:45:00] <%SSaryn> You know what...
[1:45:01] <mr_hunter> Nah just l2p
[1:45:06] <JamvaanPS4> Greed only levels the playing field, but it still sucks.
[1:45:10] <+LuckyDingo> Oh shit, I didn't even think of that, lmao!
[1:45:16] <+HelloImTom08> naw its bullshit, im the tank i get the tank shit now fight with everyone else in the party
[1:45:16] <%SSaryn> Yeah ok. If there is a lockout, this Greed Only is now UNDERSTANDABLE.
[1:45:16] <+NostrTXB> But MUH glamour :(
[1:45:17] <%spacekataz18> I already got all my diabolic tank gear so I'm good to go
[1:45:20] <%Remery_> No Fuck You, Pay Me
[1:45:24] <unlimited_osteopath> fuck you pay me
[1:45:29] <+Pendlez> god forbid
[1:45:30] <Forester_Skippy> there is only lockout on the new one tho the olderones you do for a glam? as a tank? good fucking luck tnak que times are insaine for aliance raid
[1:45:32] <+NYCrownlessKing> get fukt for your ideas pat Kappa
[1:45:33] <%SSaryn> Nope.
[1:45:34] <ELuscious> fuck my ass FeelsGoodMan
[1:45:34] <$BenLubar> why not just drop everyone's gear separately?
[1:45:35] <IminyourBase> i'm sure need trumps greed
[1:45:38] <+KoyaMusa> Yes there is its called Tokens
[1:45:39] <+UberWolfman> Its called going back
[1:45:40] <Jam643d> The old way was bad because you'd have the tank who could roll against it with no issue, healers only have to compete with the other healer, but DPS could possibly fight up to 4 other people
[1:45:43] <$AzureGale> Fucking tanks are the worst kind of tanks
[1:45:44] <Sunstalker> instanced
[1:45:47] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> You roll with a full party that can behave like civilized human beings.
[1:45:48] <unlimited_osteopath> the solution is play the goddamn class you want gear for
[1:45:48] <+OBS_VinnieK> greed only is BS what if someone actually needs the damn gear
[1:45:49] <+UberWolfman> UNGRADE
[1:45:52] <+HelloImTom08> I mean its all glamour anyways
[1:45:53] <+OBS_VinnieK> that is a BS change
[1:45:53] <+Pendlez> this is the best possible solution
[1:45:54] <BanSenpai> has pat ever done ultimate?
[1:45:55] <+JenovasPuppet> You still only get one piece per week.
[1:45:56] <ELuscious> isnt this how it works in wow?
[1:46:00] <Malziel> @BenLubar But then how will the MMO eat up every waking moment of your life? Kappa
[1:46:00] <TheImmortal70> @spacecaptaincrone *Might
[1:46:02] <DrakeSilvos> Best solution is to wait until the raid gear becomes a crafting recipe a few patches later.
[1:46:02] <+mik255> tokens
[1:46:07] <JamvaanPS4> Everyones rolling on the Tank and Melee DPS gear in the light houses, sucks but what can you do.
[1:46:19] <+HelloImTom08> no it wont ppl will still be bad LUL
[1:46:22] <Metballs> Just token it
[1:46:24] <%Fidel_Castbro> Its a bad change
[1:46:30] <%SSaryn> Yeah that'd be cool.
[1:46:33] <TheImmortal70> The solution is to add trading into instances so you can fucking sell gear you grab from someone live Kappa
[1:46:34] <+HelloImTom08> yep token system
[1:46:38] <Forester_Skippy> the fact there are no hard enrages in raid except for the first boss in DC doesnt matter how bad people are
[1:46:43] <+JenovasPuppet> Oh look, a 5th DRG piece!
[1:46:44] <%SSaryn> Eyyyy Token system yeah do it for Alliance raid.
[1:46:45] <+LuckyDingo> What if they allowed the "need" roll if the player has the class at the right level and has never gotten it before?
[1:46:45] <$Yakobro> @AngriestPat it's always striking gear
[1:46:51] <unlimited_osteopath> the fucking ninja
[1:46:54] <+UberWolfman> This is why Hunters in vanilla wow were shitbags
[1:46:54] <Jam643d> Fucking belts
[1:46:59] <milequetoaster> If you roll sucks you desrerve nothing
[1:47:03] <%MisterCrimson> Yeah, and considering how much I hated Rabanastre, I'm not looking forward to grinding this multiple times a week to get my gear
[1:47:09] <firesonicz> Get good at Rng
[1:47:12] <@CreepyPorpoise> Pat is super wrong
[1:47:12] <$TheNeedlesD> @UberWolfman From Vanilla to Wrath
[1:47:14] <milequetoaster> No hiding behind your Need priviledge
[1:47:16] <@CreepyPorpoise> Could he be any more wrong
[1:47:17] <unlimited_osteopath> it will still apply to me because my premade is shit
[1:47:18] <Aeonknight_87> Eureka gear is better than 360, if you're lotting for your main you're doing it wrong
[1:47:19] <@DreyfussFrost> The problem is bad players are bad on every job. Beng on their main or alt really doesn't make much of a difference.
[1:47:20] <%spacekataz18> Why don't they just do that thing where you get an item after completing an alliance like you did in dungeons?
[1:47:22] <Forester_Skippy> alexanders back boys
[1:47:22] <+JenovasPuppet> No Bahamut
[1:47:23] <%SSaryn> This is great. And will be hell at the same time.
[1:47:24] <DrakeSilvos> Back to Alex baby
[1:47:28] <ELuscious> gambling Kappa
[1:47:31] <+Toblo1> Why is there no Coil?
[1:47:31] <+natjen8> wait why no bahamut
[1:47:31] <Forester_Skippy> no coil tho... cowards!
[1:47:35] <brosuke1> SONIC BOOOOOOOOOM!!!
[1:47:35] <Metballs> Bahamut too strong
[1:47:40] <unlimited_osteopath> No Bahamaut cause it's too hard
[1:47:48] <+Felto3> bahamut is way tougher than normal raids
[1:47:49] <Forester_Skippy> its fine it sjsut 1 short fight
[1:47:50] <DrakeSilvos> People would rage if Bahamut was on there.
[1:47:50] <+Ilpala271> eh, it's trials+poes
[1:47:51] <+machinemantoys> the jets are dead
[1:47:55] <fakemalegamer> high for a single boss fight
[1:47:55] <Luiz8000> Its the same as Trials, because its pretty fast
[1:47:55] <+Toblo1> Coil too strong?
[1:47:56] <Jam643d> There was no "story" mode for bahamut, bahamut is still "savage" level
[1:47:56] <mr_hunter> yeah i really want to do turn 5 and 9 with fucking pubs
[1:47:57] <miguelrod777> mendacity?
[1:47:58] <%TheBroletariat> That's only a little less than Expert for what will usually be a 5 minute fight
[1:48:05] <$tsundere____> Coil has cutscenes that people arent gonna skip
[1:48:09] <miguelrod777> I've been gone for a while wow
[1:48:13] <+Toblo1> I mean, Im not gonna complain because I love Alexander's raid fights
[1:48:14] <inksmears> i hope they make a "normal" mode coils so people who missed will be inspired to do it. 8( the story is so good
[1:48:15] <TheImmortal70> Okay yeah so that's gotta be jade stoa EX
[1:48:16] <%SSaryn> About fucking time this happened too.
[1:48:16] <Forester_Skippy> who goes there maxxlevel for the reward?
[1:48:18] <CybertronPrime> Why is Bahamut not on there? One word: Nael.
[1:48:20] <+HelloImTom08> LUL still not enough
[1:48:22] <Forester_Skippy> nobody will do that
[1:48:33] <JamvaanPS4> Nobody will do it for the Mendacity.
[1:48:34] <%SSaryn> For leveling shit, this will still be good.
[1:48:34] <DrakeSilvos> Worth it
[1:48:36] <+Toblo1> @CybertronPrime I've never even touched Coil and I've heard horror stories of Nael
[1:48:37] <unlimited_osteopath> Turn 7 coil is also why it isn't on there
[1:48:38] <+Felto3> still not worth 50 MINUTES of cs
[1:48:41] <CashewZero> It's eating your veggies Pat
[1:48:42] <Metballs> Worth it to level
[1:48:42] <+HelloImTom08> you'd have to give me like 50K gill for a run LUL
[1:48:45] <Forester_Skippy> those last 2 are only if your level 70
[1:48:45] <Metballs> Not to cap
[1:48:46] <+KoyaMusa> ITs a 35-45 minute run
[1:48:48] <bielzitcho> FIFTY MINUTES OF CUTSCENES
[1:48:51] <@CreepyPorpoise> I just got almost 3.5 mil out of mine
[1:48:53] <%TheBroletariat> You won't get the new tomes if you're going in for the exp
[1:48:54] <@CreepyPorpoise> its good stuff
[1:48:54] <@JustinianKnight> it's pretty worth if you have the time
[1:48:56] <inksmears> ti's worth it! easiest way to get tomestones. flip on netflix and cruise through
[1:48:57] <Aeonknight_87> @AngriestPat you don't get tomes if you're getting the xp. have to be @ max level for tomes
[1:49:03] <unlimited_osteopath> watch Netflix on the side
[1:49:04] <+JenovasPuppet> @tsundere____ Coil is also tuned the same as Savage is for other raids. Going into some of those fights with pugs would be a nightmare.
[1:49:06] <unlimited_osteopath> watch the horse porn anime
[1:49:13] <%SSaryn> It's big.
[1:49:20] <+HelloImTom08> UNSKIPABLE CUT SCENES, no thank you
[1:49:21] <%TheBroletariat> You get about 2.5 dungeons of exp for 2 dungeons of time
[1:49:26] <+SailingSaturn> its worth it too me
[1:49:45] <DrakeSilvos> Still pissed at what they did to the Gaius cutscenes.
[1:49:58] <$tsundere____> @JenovasPuppet yea that makes sense, I never did Coils at launch so I dunno how hard they actually are
[1:50:03] <+Toblo1> Meanwhile in my roulettes I just keep getting the early dungeons and nearly falling asleep
[1:50:04] <BanSenpai> i mean if i get aurum vale in the roulette, im still leaving the duty
[1:50:06] <%MisterCrimson> what garbage groups are you running with that it takes more than 15 minutes to run a dungeon?
[1:50:07] <unlimited_osteopath> true true, Aurum Vale DOES ruin my day
[1:50:21] <%SpcOpsBear> Ryumyaku gear is the Mendacity gear
[1:50:34] <+Pendlez> PUGs @mistercrimson
[1:50:48] <Metballs> Give the bots some variety
[1:50:49] <+JenovasPuppet> Ye-ye-ye!
[1:51:01] <milequetoaster> Now I can get the Seal Rock achievements
[1:51:10] <+KSabot> Ruins of Pitchford
[1:51:11] <CybertronPrime> @toblo1 My FC did an unsynced Coil run, and even with 8 70s Nael thrashed us several times.
[1:51:13] <%TheBroletariat> if SB dungeons are taking 15 minutes with no one synced you in some fucking bizzaro world
[1:51:13] <%RaikenTB> is there an obvious indicator of who's married to who in this game?
[1:51:14] <%SSaryn> E-SPORTS
[1:51:15] <milequetoaster> and the sick looking gear it gives
[1:51:18] <Forester_Skippy> i saw that map once almsot 2 years ago sicne then its the stupid ice map
[1:51:27] <%GarbageNirvana> Is the Borderlands ruins' endboss Randy Pitchford
[1:51:28] <+Zerberus410> oooooh that caster gear!
[1:51:32] <unlimited_osteopath> that's a fanmade gearset
[1:51:32] <+HelloImTom08> probally dungeon gear
[1:51:38] <Forester_Skippy> that set is super good
[1:51:39] <%SSaryn> WHO CARES MALE BUNNY OUTFITS
[1:51:40] <NoirePanzer> I've come up with a new recipeh
[1:51:47] <+HelloImTom08> Kreygasm
[1:51:47] <%SSaryn> Now we can all be degenerates
[1:51:49] <DrakeSilvos> Bun buns
[1:51:52] <Jam643d> It's dungeon gear because the 24 man has the cool gear
[1:51:54] <JamvaanPS4> Thank god for this, this is the best thing
[1:52:01] <Metballs> Was that not always there?
[1:52:03] <+Toblo1> One for the pervs
[1:52:06] <TheImmortal70> Move over limsa cat girls, the fucking BUNNY BOIS ARE HERE
[1:52:07] <+sindrantz> Have yall heard about that strip club in balmung?
[1:52:08] <+HelloImTom08> 24 man gear is so ugly LOL
[1:52:09] <unlimited_osteopath> it only took them, what, 5 years for the bunny suit?
[1:52:17] <DrakeSilvos> SURE IS
[1:52:17] <unlimited_osteopath> they've been hyping it up so much
[1:52:18] <%SpcOpsBear> Yeah, now you can tell now whether or not you should even try to spam Ishgardian Muffin to level to 54 CUL you nerd
[1:52:18] <%wunderkindest> @sindrantz Which one? Kappa
[1:52:20] <%spacekataz18> That one japanese guy is real angry about his immersion being broken by guy bunny outfits

[1:52:35] <aslfrasle> @sindrantz Which one? There are plenty
[1:52:39] <unlimited_osteopath> his immersion is broken by a dude in a bunny suit but not by a tank wearing a bikini?
[1:52:46] <+Pendlez> if I want to dress my lalafell up you can't stop me
[1:52:50] <%SSaryn> Big doggo.
[1:52:53] <Bloogoose> Borf

[1:54:51] <%Remery_> Why can I hear you swallow?
[1:54:52] <%SSaryn> Needs at least 15 for the jobs.
[1:54:54] <@DreyfussFrost> Still need more plates. At least as many as there are jobs.
[1:55:04] <damienlunas> :O
[1:55:08] <+EmoLlama> finally, that got annoying switching between all 3 tanks
[1:55:14] <+Pendlez> get those cul clothes on
[1:55:20] <DrakeSilvos> Definitely, the crafted crafter gear looks bland.
[1:55:26] <+JenovasPuppet> That's not even counting crafters
[1:55:38] <+SailingSaturn> but who will ever be a fisher cirDerp
[1:55:39] <+HelloImTom08> I would accept 30 plates but i want like 50

[1:56:20] <unlimited_osteopath> bless his soul
[1:56:21] <Forester_Skippy> you can go into HARD LSD mode with that its really something
[1:56:23] <%shin_garbage> cheer500 i cant believe i've been watching you read patch notes for a game i have no interest in. I dunno what the fuck you're talking about so here's some money i guess.
[1:56:30] <DrakeSilvos> Huzzah I can see again.
[1:56:31] <%SSaryn> Don't do it.
[1:56:33] <abowlofapplejacks> The hypest reading continues
[1:56:36] <Metballs> I really am impressed by the UI stuff XIV does, especially this colourblind part
[1:56:38] <%SSaryn> You bastards.
[1:56:42] <Bloogoose> Don't clip your aquarium's kids.
[1:56:44] <+KoyaMusa> is it time to play the video game
[1:56:52] <%SSaryn> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[1:56:52] <Arth__> i lay down in my chair after like 5m
[1:56:55] <DrakeSilvos> I remember when a fisher crashed the game.
[1:56:57] <Arth__> thats how i broke my last one
[1:56:58] <Metballs> Roebro
[1:56:58] <@DreyfussFrost> Transfer of character save data from PS3 to PS4 is no longer available! WTF SE SwiftRage
[1:56:59] <milequetoaster> OOOOOH
[1:57:06] <+HelloImTom08> omg we are gonna play the game D:
[1:57:07] <$TheNeedlesD> Your body is naturally trying to put you in your Pillars 2's character pose @AngriestPat
[1:57:07] <+HannibalBeerus> aquariums have kids?
[1:57:09] <$AzureGale> time 2 play
[1:57:15] <%spacekataz18> My fish fucking t-posed to hell when i clipped my aquarium
[1:57:18] <Laecerelius> Playing the game?! What is this bullshit?
[1:57:22] <unlimited_osteopath> stretch those short legs, you short man
[1:57:27] <%VoxNoctemz> @angriestpat Do you know which server max plays on?
[1:57:29] <%SSaryn> @DreyfussFrost I thought that was still going on for another 2 weeks?>
[1:57:31] <+Mistheart101> Oh good I joined right when the stream went to BRB
[1:57:35] <$AzureGale> Is he peeing gagin
[1:57:39] <+pleroma00> as a colorblind clown, i really like the updates to the color stuff.
[1:57:42] <%shin_garbage> WOW HE'S PLAYING THE GAME, i dont want him to play the game i want a patch notes stream
[1:57:45] <Metballs> Well, time to bail. Patch Notes were the real game.
[1:57:46] <aslfrasle> Do you think Pat plays a Roe because it lets him feel tall?
[1:57:54] <Reanimator83> We don't come here for game Pat. You should know this.
[1:58:00] <+laxseen> FF14 isn't just patch notes? Amazing!
[1:58:03] <unlimited_osteopath> Pat has said he always goes for the biggest, hugest character in most games that offer that option
[1:58:04] <@DreyfussFrost> Says in the patch notes that it's ending in 4.3? Just joking anyway, kind of way overdue for doing that at this point.
[1:58:08] <Laecerelius> Pat aims to become huge
[1:58:23] <milequetoaster> @aslfrasle That's why he hates Lalafells
[1:58:24] <PopdropGardner> Shap-shifter
[1:58:26] <MarylandJutsu> ELMO TAKE OVR THE STREAM NOW
[1:58:29] <FriendlyPatches> What? There is a game?
[1:58:31] <%shin_garbage> whats FF14? i thought he was just reading patch notes for various games
[1:58:32] <milequetoaster> they remind him of himself
[1:58:43] <%PSOCecil> The "Stormblood story" will end in 4.3, meaning we're in full expansion hype mode from 4.4 onward.
[1:58:45] <%SSaryn> @DreyfussFrost Sure is, but I can understand, some people still in there on PS3, I assume a lot of people in Japan still are.
[1:58:46] <PopdropGardner> @shin_garbage Final fantasy MMO
[1:58:54] <%PSOCecil> Nobody's on on PS3 anyomre.
[1:58:58] <%PSOCecil> It shut down when 4.0 came out.
[1:58:59] <unlimited_osteopath> the DOMAN SIDE of the story ends in 4.3
[1:59:00] <%MisterCrimson> I used to be an Au Ra, but then I converted to Potatoism
[1:59:01] <unlimited_osteopath> not stormblood
[1:59:11] <%SSaryn> Ahhh thats right actually.
[1:59:12] <%shin_garbage> i was making a joke about this being a patch note stream for 2 hours, mate
[1:59:16] <%SSaryn> 4.0 ended PS3 support.
[1:59:33] <%PSOCecil> They also gave all PS3 owners a free download copy of the PS4 version.
[1:59:35] <aslfrasle> I would be an Au Ra if only the horns weren't tied to faces.
[1:59:42] <CybertronPrime> if Heavensward is anything to go by, 4.5 will be the end of Stormblood.
[1:59:44] <PopdropGardner> I just got here, is fun is all
[1:59:47] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:00:03] <%PSOCecil> Yeah, Yoshida hinted that 'maybe' SB might go past 4.55
[2:00:12] <%PSOCecil> but with how Square LOVES its patterns, I don't think it will.
[2:00:14] <aslfrasle> I want to pick my own horns dammit
[2:00:21] <$AzureGale> Good bot
[2:00:29] <RaidenTheBloodEdge> Good bot
[2:00:32] <PopdropGardner> Why not Stormblood 2
[2:00:37] <aslfrasle> good bot
[2:00:38] <CybertronPrime> I really want the next expansion to take us to Garlemald.
[2:00:41] <thelonechris> Good bot
[2:00:49] <unlimited_osteopath> that's what it seems to be hinting at
[2:00:50] <%PSOCecil> And with Fanfest starting in November, which is right around when, most likely, 4.5 will be coming out, we'll get an expansion announcement, and a 5.0 launch in June 2019.
[2:00:54] <%SSaryn> Helllooooo
[2:00:57] <+superkeaton> Hewo rooVV
[2:00:57] <%shin_garbage> hi

[2:02:05] <+jkcclemens> hildibrand best anime
[2:02:06] <@DreyfussFrost> Best FF character is naturally also the best server.

[2:03:28] <aslfrasle> *degenerates
[2:03:47] <+Raspada_Ryner> Pat looks tired
[2:03:57] <crimsonharvest> I'm not giving up on a Dragon's Dogma stream
[2:03:58] <%Remery_> Big Boi
[2:04:03] <%XzileGaming> oh wow, we going to do the gameplay
[2:04:08] <%SSaryn> Why is Limsa Lominsa so good.
[2:04:14] <CybertronPrime> Balmung is the RP server, isn't it?
[2:04:16] <+Brighthawk> Welcome back to Eorzea big guy!
[2:04:21] <unlimited_osteopath> well the game IS a fanservicefest of a game
[2:04:23] <%Laecerelius> A DD stream would be cool.
[2:04:31] <DrakeSilvos> Not too long
[2:04:31] <%SSaryn> Big shitposts.
[2:04:36] <%PSOCecil> 4.1, like the other patches, have like.. probably 3-4 hours of story?
[2:04:38] <+KoyaMusa> Its cause Pat is a coward and doesn't want us to see the ERP
[2:04:39] <%XzileGaming> Pat, do an ASMR strem
[2:04:43] <+Pendlez> disrespect pat; play a lalafell

[2:05:01] <%TheBlackMandalorian> is lit
[2:05:02] <TioXyco> it's sounding
[2:05:02] <unlimited_osteopath> sound is good
[2:05:02] <DrakeSilvos> All good
[2:05:04] <+SailingSaturn> how do people keep their inv empty because I can't cirThink
[2:05:05] <+Toblo1> Look, I play Miqo'te and I'm goddamn proud of it
[2:05:05] <+JenovasPuppet> Buy cheap gil using the promo code Wooliem.
[2:05:07] <olliedelosa> I want to see your huge shit posts
[2:05:10] <+Zundelle> the shitposts aren't big enough if your camera can block them
[2:05:11] <%Macbutters86> I only want DD stream if we get original opening
[2:05:11] <+KoyaMusa> Pat i want to see the gil sellers
[2:05:13] <@thenefftw> Things are good
[2:05:16] <Silly_Duckling> I was a potato-man when I played, I regret nothing, I was adorbs
[2:05:17] <%SGrim> audio is good.
[2:05:24] <+Pendlez> @toblo1 you shouldn't be
[2:05:25] <+OBS_VinnieK> floe1 floe2 He's hiding all the ERP that he does on the side floeOMG
[2:05:25] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat Hey Pat how have you been not caught a stream in a while, hope you Paige and Elmomare happy how's the gym going
[2:05:28] <SirKamBam> Talk slower
[2:05:34] <%SpcOpsBear> Hey, I was the man on stream with the black pot helmet! Hi Mom!
[2:05:37] <+FearEngine> I can still hear you, can you turn you down Kappa
[2:05:39] <%HiroTSK5> the house you no longer have?
[2:05:39] <%TheBlackMandalorian> Pat explain why this game is better then wow I love wow and struggle to get into other mmos or just show me cool shit
[2:05:40] <DrakeSilvos> @SailingSaturn I also wonder this, I'm a hoarder.
[2:05:47] <unlimited_osteopath> go back to the house the government took from ya?
[2:05:47] <%PSOCecil> Lalafell best race, fite me any of you
[2:05:48] <+Toblo1> Hey look, I cashed in my furry dick convention ticket/dignity a long time ago
[2:05:49] <Silly_Duckling> I feed on the hate Kappa
[2:05:52] <%XzileGaming> these people have been waiting two hours for you to log in so they can stream snipe you, have some consideration for their creepiness, will you
[2:05:52] <+UberWolfman> Uncle Pat with his potato racism.
[2:05:57] <Metballs> I bounce between catgirl and potato girl because I'm trash
[2:06:02] <%Remery_> Potato Race
[2:06:02] <MyDarkStorm> you are on ultros
[2:06:09] <Forester_Skippy> hey im a lalafell because people coudnt stop whispering me 50 times a day to ERP and you know what i love being a lalafell now
[2:06:12] <unlimited_osteopath> not enough dark arts in that rotation
[2:06:13] <+mik255> whens lizard man race
[2:06:17] <+LuckyChocobo> POTATO MASTER RACE
[2:06:20] <$AzureGale> Kill it dead!
[2:06:22] <%xero93> Wh-What am I looking at
[2:06:24] <Bloogoose> Bring Bangaa to 14
[2:06:25] <+mik255> not the aura
[2:06:27] <%PSOCecil> Don't talk to me about missing abilities, Pat. SCOURGE. I'm still crying.
[2:06:36] <+Pendlez> potato bois
[2:06:38] <Foggysheep> now i can be a potato trap in a bunny suit
[2:06:39] <unlimited_osteopath> I play lalafell too and boy do we lift off the ground when we do dark arts
[2:06:39] <+KSabot> surprised you still remember your rotation, I had no idea how to play my RDM when I came back.
[2:06:41] <+KoyaMusa> Do you? Really?
[2:06:43] <%Remery_> How did that Potato race not get extinct?
[2:06:47] <unlimited_osteopath> just noticed you barely go up in the air as any other tall race
[2:06:48] <+rhapsodyinrose> I'm a catboi because I can't help myself
[2:06:49] <%Laecerelius> They already have anime dragon girls so probably no cool lizard people
[2:06:56] <enternius> Dude the sound effect on Scourge was incredible
[2:07:01] <@DreyfussFrost> @TheBlackMandalorian I used to play WoW. #1 benefit of 14 is saving yourself from repetitive stress injury by using a controller and appreciating the longer GCD. Also helps that the story is not only MUCH better than WoW's, but better than most FFs.
[2:07:02] <+Toblo1> Do the Au Ra not count as Lizard people
[2:07:04] <DrakeSilvos> I expected the Lupin to become a race.
[2:07:17] <Forester_Skippy> @unlimited_osteopath yeah we do its great
[2:07:18] <%PSOCecil> Scourge was the goddamn best ability.
[2:07:24] <Metballs> Au ra are either dragons or demons or whatever. It's really not clear.
[2:07:24] <Bloogoose> Au Ra are dragon people right? That's different enough to lizards... I think
[2:07:25] <damienlunas> So Pat's still on 4.1?
[2:07:30] <+rhapsodyinrose> God I miss scourge
[2:07:39] <+Toblo1> look at all those birds and horses
[2:07:39] <%SSaryn> @AngriestPat Would recommend going to the Achivement vendor, you get a really good mount
[2:07:40] <+Raspada_Ryner> @AngriestPat haven't played DRK since beginning of 4.0, how are they now?
[2:07:43] <DrakeSilvos> Now you can get a trophy with its drops.
[2:07:45] <%Laecerelius> I’ve heard talk of viera maybe getting added some day.
[2:07:47] <drops50000> Is that Kirin?
[2:07:50] <TheEvilOmega> Ixion? You mean Beyonce?
[2:07:51] <unlimited_osteopath> Ixion
[2:07:56] <+HelloImTom08> he ugly imo
[2:07:57] <%TheBlackMandalorian> @DreyfussFrost when I played it was before they remade it so ill be interested to see what it looks like ive thought about getting it just don't want to spend money on something I cant be sure of
[2:07:58] <ragasquid> that horse is fuckin flying
[2:07:59] <Aydarkzero> and it can fly
[2:08:00] <+Toblo1> I've never done the Extreme/Savage stuff sooooooo I have none of these
[2:08:03] <+Pendlez> you can watch a lot of twitch while healing huh
[2:08:04] <+quarkee> why not use kirin
[2:08:06] <unlimited_osteopath> bro we have flying elephants
[2:08:07] <%PSOCecil> I miss Flaming Arrow on Bard, too.
[2:08:08] <+EmoLlama> i miss fracture FeelsBadMan
[2:08:08] <TheEvilOmega> Yeah, looks like Beyonce to me.
[2:08:08] <%Remery_> Looks likeKirin
[2:08:09] <%Tallie> donkey from shrek looking ass
[2:08:10] <DrakeSilvos> Ixion has the goofiest gallop.
[2:08:11] <Metballs> Lochs music is fabtastic
[2:08:13] <%HiroTSK5> Stole Yunie's horse :(
[2:08:15] <%spacekataz18> Big dumb hors
[2:08:18] <%Remery_> KIRIN
[2:08:18] <+mik255> THICC
[2:08:23] <%Fenrirlives> HE IS A GOOD HORSE
[2:08:23] <%xero93> Oroshi Kirin PogChamp
[2:08:25] <%PSOCecil> look at those baby levels
[2:08:25] <Bloogoose> JEEZ
[2:08:26] <+Toblo1> I think the closest thing I've done for Extreme is the Wandering Minstrel version of the Ultima Weapon fight
[2:08:26] <+KoyaMusa> LOOK AT ALL THOSE LOW LEVELS
[2:08:27] <FriendlyPatches> It's beyonce
[2:08:28] <%TrueSpartan14> I remember getting Ixion what a nightmare
[2:08:29] <%SSaryn> Big months.
[2:08:30] <hagly> Pat flying around on magical horse farts

[2:08:36] <%Fenrirlives> TURN IXION INTO AN UMAMUSUME
[2:08:37] <Bloogoose> I see a Monk that isn't at 70
[2:08:39] <Archmortal> As much as I want whatever "collect all the wolf mounts" achievement mount, I got Amaterasu and frankly Ixion can go fuck itself
[2:08:40] <Foymic> holy shit
[2:08:42] <Bloogoose> Disappointed
[2:08:45] <+HelloImTom08> jesus crist
[2:08:48] <+RedPanda493> @AngriestPat Thicc kirin
[2:08:50] <+Xanax44> I do not have the patience to craft in 14
[2:08:51] <@thenefftw> @Fenrirlives You've got the right idea
[2:08:52] <Forester_Skippy> @AngriestPat its fine just prevoke and shirk a random guy that has high agro
[2:08:54] <Antrodox> why is it flying?
[2:08:58] <+ZakGaiGar> fly over the dooor
[2:09:00] <+mik255> its painted on
[2:09:02] <abowlofapplejacks> If you squint, kinda looks like ganon
[2:09:03] <+HelloImTom08> cause magic
[2:09:04] <$Yakobro> pat talk to the guard
[2:09:04] <%PSOCecil> As a former Bard main, I'm now, DPS-wise, a RDM main. I verlove RDM.
[2:09:06] <+senfood> Real fake door.
[2:09:10] <+Toblo1> Finding all the Aether currents are a pain
[2:09:16] <DrakeSilvos> That door is there just so you have to socialize with the guard.
[2:09:20] <%Remery_> So anyone read any good Fanfic lately?
[2:09:23] <deviljhojho94> horses dont fly where you live?
[2:09:23] <+mik255> zebra
[2:09:24] <Fathuran> I didn't even know there were flying mounts in this.
[2:09:25] <+Toblo1> I need to try Red Mage at some point
[2:09:27] <MarylandJutsu> BIG SERVER CRASH
[2:09:29] <+rose_silver> why are you not a cute cat person
[2:09:29] <unlimited_osteopath> the aether currents in SB areas area at least better placed than the ones in HW
[2:09:35] <TioXyco> I wonder how silly a lalafel would look riding Ixion, considering their si\e and all
[2:09:36] <+Felto3> booooo
[2:09:39] <%PSOCecil> Lyse: I'm here to be a worse character than I was in 1.0-3.55.
[2:09:39] <%SSaryn> Why is Lyse so cool.
[2:09:39] <+mik255> lyse is a waifu

[2:12:56] <%PSOCecil> tattooed troublemaker, what a poor man
[2:12:57] <+JenovasPuppet> Fordola even wants to die. Lyse is just a coward.
[2:12:57] <Ser_Randal> Ayeyeyeyeyeye time for mob justice
[2:12:59] <%TenderBabyBacon> Mobs have the best logic.
[2:13:00] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> They're really feeling it

[2:13:01] <Bloogoose> Yeyeyeye
[2:13:02] <Schramjet> They're all super right

[2:13:05] <+Toblo1> AAAAAY MY BOI
[2:13:08] <DantesAnimus> these accents and the style are so conflicting omfg
[2:13:15] <Bloogoose> How does Raubahn keep getting cooler?
[2:13:15] <PopdropGardner> Is it bad that I actually like the female villains this expansion
[2:13:15] <poodo89> oh man pat's back in

[2:13:28] <%PSOCecil> Good job, Raubaun, two thumbs up... awww
[2:13:29] <+Ryuartyi_> Cause he was Immortal Flames to work on.
[2:13:30] <Foggysheep> because anime
[2:13:30] <DrakeSilvos> General One-arm saves the day.
[2:13:31] <+UberWolfman> One hand daddy!
[2:13:34] <unlimited_osteopath> Lyse has jack shit experience leading people
[2:13:36] <miguelrod777> he's needed back in eorzea
[2:13:36] <Forester_Skippy> i forgot how good this is gonna get
[2:13:37] <ragasquid> oh good raubahn is still alive
[2:13:38] <AJusticeLemon> cuz they need to shove a "waifu" in our face
[2:13:40] <%SGrim> oops LUL
[2:13:42] <Foggysheep> raubahn isnt waifu enough for square
[2:13:43] <miguelrod777> the war and all
[2:13:46] <%TheBroletariat> Lyse super doesn't want to lead shit. She spent most of SB talking about how bad she would be at it
[2:13:57] <Valask> oh is this THE Raubahn? From the Raubahn wall?
[2:13:58] <%MisterCrimson> Raubahn is best boi after Estinien
[2:14:06] <+JenovasPuppet> Post 4.2 I want to move to Ala Mhigo. Ul'dah's just not the same anymore.
[2:14:08] <CybertronPrime> Is Pat gonna do Delta or Sigmascape?
[2:14:09] <%spacekataz18> This is THE WALL
[2:14:13] <%spacekataz18> Of Ala Mhigo
[2:14:15] <poodo89> nah Raubahn is just best boi
[2:14:16] <Metballs> The fight with Raubahn is still the highlight
[2:14:16] <+mik255> estinien is pretty much batman at this point
[2:14:21] <%VoxNoctemz> @angriestpat Npc sound could be louder, a little soft right now
[2:14:21] <+UberWolfman> Raubahn won't leave his Sultana's side, So lyse has to pick up the slack,
[2:14:23] <miguelrod777> this English sound weird give me viral potatoe
[2:14:25] <%PSOCecil> Ul'Dah will always be my home.
[2:14:43] <%SSaryn> Man Raubahn is fucking great.
[2:14:52] <inksmears> raubahn is awesome
[2:14:53] <abowlofapplejacks> How does the story of 14 stack up to other games in the genre
[2:14:54] <+ZakGaiGar> SAVAGES
[2:14:55] <%spacekataz18> Da best
[2:14:55] <milequetoaster> YES
[2:14:56] <$Chimeraelite> goddamn
[2:14:59] <DrakeSilvos> Almost been a year since the great Raubahn bottleneck.
[2:15:00] <Metballs> I would love to fight Raubahn at his peak
[2:15:03] <miguelrod777> it's fine
[2:15:04] <Schramjet> 3 billion war crimes
[2:15:07] <%spacekataz18> It's pretty gud
[2:15:07] <%PSOCecil> Honestly, FFXIV's plot isn't as good as FFXI's.
[2:15:08] <+Toblo1> She's done enough Warcrimes to make Zeon go "fucking Chill"
[2:15:12] <poodo89> Also when's dual blade class
[2:15:16] <TheImmortal70> She killed a shit ton of her own people for no other reason than "ALA MHIGO SUCKS"
[2:15:16] <+Neku054> Pat you should turn on the low latency mode. its in your Dashboard under Channel Settings
[2:15:19] <Forester_Skippy> it makes sense he can talk like that sinc ehes the no pun intended right hand of the sultana and leader of the flames
[2:15:19] <$TheNeedlesD> but its not as fun
[2:15:20] <%Remery_> Like Paige?
[2:15:23] <%SSaryn> NO SHUT UP
[2:15:25] <$Yakobro> LOL
[2:15:25] <%SpcOpsBear> Punish not the soldier for the crimes of the general
[2:15:26] <AJusticeLemon> is this YOUR gun?
[2:15:27] <+Brighthawk> Sloppeh!
[2:15:28] <%SGrim> One dude clapping LUL
[2:15:29] <+Ryuartyi_> QUIET THO
[2:15:29] <unlimited_osteopath> shut up pay me
[2:15:30] <%TheBroletariat> Spoilers
[2:15:34] <+rhapsodyinrose> I remember the great Raubahn (Savage) of 2017
[2:15:34] <+Toblo1> Don't think about it Pat
[2:15:37] <+TalesOfCreed> shhhhh
[2:15:41] <DrakeSilvos> Ilberd survived and grew a mullet.
[2:15:44] <%PSOCecil> slap him raubaun
[2:15:44] <+JenovasPuppet> Fordola straight up needs to die. Yotsuyu deserves redemption thought because she's cute.
[2:15:52] <+mik255> SLOPPY
[2:15:54] <DantesAnimus> awkward
[2:15:54] <%PSOCecil> Fordola is great shut up.
[2:15:56] <Vakojin> Look at that dork
[2:15:57] <ColmBearheart> inb4 twist that it's actually just Illberd all along
[2:15:58] <damienlunas> @AngriestPat I say keep her alive and make her watch as Ala Mhigo rebuilds itself proving that she collaborated with the Garleans for nothing.
[2:15:59] <TrubbleBass> I dunno Pat, sometimes a town needs a good lynch mob to smooth things over
[2:15:59] <@DreyfussFrost> @abowlofapplejacks Best story in an MMO by far, except maybe 11 which I didn't get far in. Better than most of the FF series and therefore also most jRPGs.
[2:16:00] <+Toblo1> @rhapsodyinrose I didn't get SB on early/release day but maaaaaan I remember the jokes that came from those days
[2:16:03] <inksmears> fordola's backstory is pretty sad tho she deserves a chance
[2:16:09] <+Blain_Cooper> Raubahn is the coolest
[2:16:09] <+TheShal> Would you say that that was... sloppy?
[2:16:12] <%PSOCecil> Nanamo is best character hush.
[2:16:14] <unlimited_osteopath> Fordola is a war criminal.
[2:16:16] <Metballs> Fordola is in a much better place than Yotsuyu
[2:16:19] <inksmears> lyse is so awwfuullll
[2:16:19] <+SailingSaturn> But she killed all those dudes
[2:16:23] <%MisterCrimson> I still believe that Elidibus is in Gaius's body
[2:16:24] <Foggysheep> because waifu
[2:16:24] <CybertronPrime> I'm still in line for Raubahn EX...
[2:16:25] <%SGrim> @PSOCecil Fordola did nothing wrong? apatLiz
[2:16:28] <inksmears> they need to write lyse better 8(
[2:16:29] <Forester_Skippy> she isnt even a highlander and shes alamigan?
[2:16:29] <+HelloImTom08> Lyse sucks
[2:16:30] <$Yakobro> @AngriestPat don't worry there's a worse character than lyse to come
[2:16:31] <%PSOCecil> Fordola did NOTHING wrong.
[2:16:31] <+rhapsodyinrose> @Toblo1 The memes almooost made up for get progression blocked for three days lol
[2:16:32] <+JonesInTheFastLane> I agree Fordola is straight up a monster and needs to be put down.
[2:16:32] <%GarbageNirvana> You beat Fordola? I beat Fordola
[2:16:33] <+UberWolfman> Lyse did all the logstics so you can be a big hero man.
[2:16:36] <Foggysheep> same reason as minfillia
[2:16:36] <+TheShal> You liberated this? I liberated this...
[2:16:43] <TheImmortal70> I don't know who this yotsuyu is, but Tsuyu seems nice
[2:16:46] <+Toblo1> Won the rebellion, still high on angry juice
[2:16:53] <+rose_silver> Collaberators? you mean Woolies?
[2:16:53] <+Toblo1> HAHAHAHA GET FUCKED ZENOS
[2:16:54] <+KoyaMusa> Pat you totally misread that
[2:16:55] <%IMDRanged> Is gamma correct? Or this scene takes place with super low lighting?
[2:16:55] <Village10> She's a waifu and he isn't and they thought they sell her as being a protagonist on being such. So, Femal Vaan
[2:16:56] <inksmears> that comes back in 4.3.... perhaps..........
[2:16:59] <+Blain_Cooper> Nothing like a good grave stompin'
[2:17:02] <+HelloImTom08> Fordola is kinda cool
[2:17:02] <poodo89> hey man angry juice is pretty tasty
[2:17:04] <unlimited_osteopath> why the fuck did Xenos even GET a grave lol
[2:17:05] <%MisterCrimson> yes...Zenos's grave
[2:17:06] <+Felto3> dug him up...
[2:17:10] <miguelrod777> Why he doesn't care
[2:17:11] <ae_moth> actually, that Zenos grave thing is may lead to more... grave things
[2:17:13] <+diazflak> It ww2 all over again
[2:17:16] <%PSOCecil> It's late, in-game, so its dark out.
[2:17:22] <ChronoCanti> someones gonna shit in his casket
[2:17:23] <Jam643d> I mean, where else are you going to put the body
[2:17:27] <+SailingSaturn> Tar and feather then
[2:17:28] <+CosmicGuitars> Y'all are awful at being coy
[2:17:29] <Schramjet> @Forester_Skippy She and Minfillia are both technically Highlander, in the game files at least. But there were no female highlanders originally
[2:17:31] <unlimited_osteopath> Idk just burn it or something
[2:17:31] <+EmoLlama> people trying to foreshadow, you're not clever lionDoubtit
[2:17:32] <Vakojin> They're shaving women in these ala migho streets
[2:17:36] <+HelloImTom08> pretty revenge is actually really awesome
[2:17:39] <+Toblo1> Yotsuyu made people kill family for laughs
[2:17:46] <abowlofapplejacks> @DreyfussFrost @PSOCecil Well that's definitely some ovations for 11, but from what I had a chance to play with the free trails a couple years back 14 sounds/looks pretty good
[2:17:48] <miguelrod777> it's fine
[2:17:48] <+Toblo1> For shits and giggles
[2:17:55] <%GarbageNirvana> It's a win/win/win
[2:17:55] <Metballs> Fordola was born into occupation
[2:17:56] <+drakenpwnd> @AngriestPat how is that race? Casting classes look good?
[2:18:00] <%PSOCecil> FFXI's issue was that its plot was really hard to get to.
[2:18:01] <Silly_Duckling> so... execute Lyse
[2:18:03] <Metballs> Yotsuyu just did it for revenge
[2:18:04] <inksmears> lyse the Actual Worst
[2:18:06] <Forester_Skippy> @Schramjet oh huh thats actually itneresting
[2:18:11] <damienlunas> YES
[2:18:12] <%PSOCecil> Like, the game itself was hard to play, but the story stuff had next to no direction.
[2:18:15] <+JenovasPuppet> The Domans deserved everything they got because when Yotsuyu was a kid the Garleans hurt her. That tracks.
[2:18:18] <+Toblo1> Yotsuyu was fueled by spite and/or revenge
[2:18:22] <+Toblo1> Or both
[2:18:23] <CybertronPrime> Don't give her the satisfaction if she wants to be executed.
[2:18:23] <%MisterCrimson> I hate Lyse
[2:18:24] <inksmears> Pat confirmed bette leader than Lyse
[2:18:25] <ChronoCanti> just beat them all up
[2:18:33] <@DreyfussFrost> @abowlofapplejacks 14 is REALLY good. I can't comment on 11, I didn't get far. 14 is fantastic though. It's a better singleplayer jRPG than most actual singleplayer jRPGs.
[2:18:34] <damienlunas> @AngriestPat Executing Fordola would be giving her what she wants now though.
[2:18:38] <%SSaryn> Nah not really.
[2:18:39] <grayjammer> BUT PAT. THERES NO ROOM FOR NUAAAANCE
[2:18:40] <%SSaryn> That's accurate.
[2:18:40] <Forester_Skippy> i told zenos i was his friend... then i kileld him in cold blood... DARK ARTS!
[2:18:41] <+NYCrownlessKing> yes you are crazy
[2:18:41] <miguelrod777> pat would be a shit leader
[2:18:42] <%spacekataz18> You ain't
[2:18:43] <%IMDRanged> Are they vampires or something? Why have a conversation in the dark?
[2:18:43] <poodo89> lyse is pretty bad
[2:18:44] <%TheBroletariat> Because not everyone has a huge murder boner like you Pat
[2:18:49] <+NYCrownlessKing> ur a shit leader pat
[2:18:50] <%GarbageNirvana> This is that whole Japanese morality thing of "We can't kill the bad guys because we'd be no better than them"
[2:18:51] <+NYCrownlessKing> Kappa
[2:18:52] <inksmears> you'll see pay
[2:18:53] <inksmears> pat
[2:18:53] <TheImmortal70> Just fucking chop her head, and be done with it
[2:18:56] <unlimited_osteopath> the dude that said DARK ARTS... I'm right there with you
[2:18:56] <%Remery_> Murder Boner <3
[2:19:03] <%spacekataz18> Y'all just gonna let the joker go? smh
[2:19:04] <DrakeSilvos> This is the Batman morality.
[2:19:05] <+Ingenk> But where’s the line though. What defines collaborations.
[2:19:08] <+jkcclemens> "why have a conversation in the dark" because it's dark outside?
[2:19:09] <Pappajimbo> we didnt hang all the nazis just the top guys
[2:19:10] <%SSaryn> But Lyse needs to not kill anyone to set up story in the future.
[2:19:11] <milequetoaster> Executing is like the shittiest solution though
[2:19:17] <+Zundelle> we need to draw this murder line in this blood sand
[2:19:20] <milequetoaster> nobody learns
[2:19:27] <ThatRandomGuy661> Time for a good cutscene, iirc
[2:19:29] <+diazflak> You cant give in to mob rule
[2:19:29] <+KSabot> Pat would be a collaborator for an occupying force in an instant and also wants the collaborators to die? evoMindBlown
[2:19:30] <+Toblo1> Draw some lines in this blood-soaked sand
[2:19:33] <%spacekataz18> Oh yeah this is good
[2:19:36] <%thepantsking> "Where do we draw the line" is such an often used philosophical stopping point with a ridiculously obvious answer
[2:19:37] <inksmears> love this scene
[2:19:42] <miguelrod777> goo boy get ready
[2:19:46] <+Toblo1> The wing ears are super cool
[2:19:46] <miguelrod777> hoo
[2:19:53] <%SSaryn> Hello Best Girl.
[2:20:00] <+Ilpala271> oh man here we go
[2:20:02] <+Toblo1> Hello miss Warcrimes
[2:20:04] <%Remery_> poke her aggressively!!!!!!
[2:20:04] <%thepantsking> "But if we kill all the bad guys, then we'd necessarily start killing good guys!". Like, what the shit.
[2:20:05] <inksmears> alphinaud so small
[2:20:10] <miguelrod777> war crime waifu
[2:20:12] <%spacekataz18> The door
[2:20:17] <%spacekataz18> is OPEN
[2:20:18] <+rose_silver> game is very quiet
[2:20:19] <%TheBroletariat> Fordola has no reason to escape. She was only helping the Garleans because they were winning. Now that they've been kicked out she has no reason to go back to them
[2:20:19] <+KoyaMusa> Here for a giggle, mate?
[2:20:21] <+NickyDynamite> This is a Japanese product. No villain ever dies, they must be redeemed no matter what
[2:20:21] <unlimited_osteopath> Kill her now!
[2:20:22] <bleugh> executions for everyone
[2:20:23] <unlimited_osteopath> Do it!
[2:20:23] <+Xanax44> oh man this cutscene is so good
[2:20:28] <inksmears> fordola doesn't want to escape tho. she wants to die.
[2:20:30] <%XzileGaming> Pat's character looks like hes wearing a hairpiece
[2:20:31] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> "My war criminal can't possibly be this cute!"
[2:20:38] <%PSOCecil> main villains die all the time in Japanese media.
[2:20:39] <poodo89> run her through with your huge sword!
[2:20:43] <%PSOCecil> It's the 'sub-villains' that are redeemed.
[2:20:44] <+UberWolfman> She wants to die a Martyr
[2:20:47] <unlimited_osteopath> Dark arts her ass!
[2:20:47] <TheImmortal70> Who the fuck cares
[2:20:50] <%Remery_> @SpaceCaptainCrone O I'd watch that

[2:21:09] <+Toblo1> Daaaang this voice acting is *INTENSE*
[2:21:11] <inksmears> arenvald is Best Boy
[2:21:12] <%SSaryn> Ok Goody-Two-Shoes chill yourself.
[2:21:15] <%IMDRanged> "Its too bright in here. Turn in down."
[2:21:16] <Archaveil> boy these animations really dont do the voice acting justice
[2:21:17] <TheImmortal70> Yeah and that's the thing as well! She fucking cared for her own soldiers at least... then randomly murders them too
[2:21:27] <TheImmortal70> At least yotsuyu just said fuck it to everyone
[2:21:34] <+SailingSaturn> Arenvald is new best boy cirLove
[2:21:39] <+Toblo1> Oops! Echo time!
[2:21:41] <%SSaryn> I mean... it still does.
[2:21:47] <inksmears> i love arenvald so much i hope he remains a main side character
[2:21:52] <Forester_Skippy> we sometimes do that yeah but not enough to be relevant ever
[2:21:52] <+Shillk> and their blue jeans are so hot
[2:21:53] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Did someone ask for a convenient plot device?
[2:21:55] <+Ryuartyi_> Garleans are the best except for their actions.
[2:21:55] <$AzureGale> Echo, echo, echo, echo
[2:21:55] <$spacehouse> and their cities are so BROWN
[2:21:56] <milequetoaster> Ooops! All Echo!
[2:21:56] <%GarbageNirvana> Pat wishes he was a Garlean
[2:21:57] <mercado94> oh boy
[2:21:58] <+rose_silver> pat's a garlean sympathizer
[2:22:02] <poodo89> Big Plots
[2:22:02] <unlimited_osteopath> their armor is so goddamn impractical but it's so cool
[2:22:04] <+jkcclemens> the garleans did nothing wrong
[2:22:05] <+KSabot> Garlemald
[2:22:06] <DrakeSilvos> Our visions we can't control
[2:22:08] <%SSaryn> Garlaen music is so amazing that it's just a remix of the main theme of Stormblood.
[2:22:12] <+Ilpala271> good news: we probably will. bad news: it'll be to fuck 'em up
[2:22:14] <ColmBearheart> game theory garleans = cool = good?????
[2:22:15] <+Blain_Cooper> Dinner dance
[2:22:18] <miguelrod777> REDEMPTION ARC
[2:22:21] <%TheBroletariat> Half of Clemp's discord is in a Garlean fan club FC its great
[2:22:26] <CybertronPrime> Imperial Will is a great aong.
[2:22:28] <Metballs> Never don't push Gaius
[2:22:29] <+rose_silver> gaius is the nicest kindest person
[2:22:31] <CybertronPrime> song*
[2:22:33] <+Toblo1> I do like how the Echo flashbacks have a weird static to them
[2:22:41] <+BarkerStreams> GAIUS DID NOTHING WRONG
[2:22:46] <inksmears> it's totally gaius
[2:22:48] <Schramjet> God I hope so
[2:22:50] <%SSaryn> Xenos did nothing wrong Kappa
[2:22:51] <inksmears> GAIUS DID NOTHING WRONG
[2:22:53] <Shinjima> Gaius = best character STILL
[2:22:56] <lilybergo> Gaius is so fucking cool
[2:22:57] <Forester_Skippy> Gaius and regula were great characters
[2:23:05] <unlimited_osteopath> Gaius was pretty reasonable.
[2:23:08] <+UberWolfman> Worse they soldout
[2:23:09] <TheImmortal70> No, he's a pro empirean
[2:23:10] <+Toblo1> I like Gaius and Nero in terms of their old armor designs
[2:23:10] <+mik255> traitor
[2:23:12] <inksmears> no he's ala mighan who is pro empire
[2:23:14] <DrakeSilvos> Might just be because she used Gaius's sword and looked up to him.
[2:23:16] <unlimited_osteopath> They're filthy ala mhigans
[2:23:19] <%SSaryn> Waow
[2:23:20] <MadOx__> @AngriestPat any chance you could turn in game up a touch? its a little low maybe 10-15%
[2:23:32] <@DreyfussFrost> It wasn't the full on third eye, just a little mark.
[2:23:34] <Vakojin> Paint
[2:23:37] <unlimited_osteopath> YO THAT'S ILBERD, TOO
[2:23:39] <damienlunas> @AngriestPat It's Garleanface

[2:23:57] <unlimited_osteopath> NANI
[2:23:58] <Vakojin> That character is PAT !
[2:23:58] <+Toblo1> hoooo boy
[2:24:03] <+Toblo1> Sweet jesus
[2:24:04] <Shinjima> Gaius built the wall, even Trump couldnt do that!
[2:24:08] <abowlofapplejacks> ha, starting to get invested and don't want to watch the stream. Catch you later
[2:24:09] <+UberWolfman> Class Warfare.
[2:24:10] <+Felto3> FUCK ALA MHIGANS

[2:24:27] <RaidenTheBloodEdge> BITCH SPAWN
[2:24:29] <+Toblo1> What a dick
[2:24:34] <+Toblo1> Uh oh
[2:24:37] <unlimited_osteopath> let the mobbing begin
[2:24:42] <+CosmicGuitars> lmao
[2:24:45] <$spacehouse> the sissiest throw
[2:24:48] <+Toblo1> THE RACE WAR STARTS NOW
[2:24:48] <+CosmicGuitars> grandma no
[2:24:50] <msshakedown> that looked terrible
[2:24:50] <%Remery_> Oh no the rocks!
[2:24:53] <+Ilpala271> How mad you gotta be to throw a rock at a little girl
[2:24:54] <+jkcclemens> who throws rocks at a child
[2:24:56] <ForlornHunter> Without context that seems tame.
[2:24:56] <inksmears> no wonder fordola wanted to kill these people
[2:25:00] <zamzoph> thrown rocks can kill man
[2:25:07] <+jkcclemens> who would riposte a child
[2:25:08] <poodo89> quick pop rampart!
[2:25:12] <+SailingSaturn> They are pretty traitor-y
[2:25:12] <Mastigias> You came to wrong neighborhood.
[2:25:15] <unlimited_osteopath> to be fair, that garlean soldier probably couldn't even SEE out of that helmet
[2:25:18] <TheImmortal70> And this just makes her loyalty to the empire even MORE questionable
[2:25:19] <%SSaryn> Hallowed Ground do it!
[2:25:20] <%TenderBabyBacon> Who doesn't throw rocks at a chld
[2:25:23] <+Zdarma88> "no"
[2:25:26] <+Toblo1> Ooooohhhhh god
[2:25:27] <TheImmortal70> They don't fucking help anyone anyways
[2:25:30] <Forester_Skippy> did you see that grunt behind ehim looking likie HOLY SHIT WHAT THTE FUCK MAN
[2:25:35] <+Toblo1> Sweet Jesus
[2:25:36] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> "Aan" being the lowest rank in Garlean society, reserved for occupied peoples.
[2:25:37] <Vakojin> Yeah Pat
[2:25:38] <+mik255> fordola was super wrong
[2:25:42] <+Verd_254> Nope, just privileges that can be revoked at any time. Kappa
[2:25:45] <Vakojin> Throw them the stones of shame
[2:25:49] <Metballs> Gerolt?
[2:25:53] <+Toblo1> ohhhhhhhh fuck

[2:26:22] <+DeadlyToastY> was that the god king
[2:26:22] <+Toblo1> Got Magic Pixel-ed
[2:26:24] <aversalammar> He got bodied
[2:26:26] <inksmears> fordola was betrayed both by her people and the empire all at once
[2:26:27] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> And that's why throwing rocks was taken out of 1.0
[2:26:34] <+Felto3> this is why we should have freed doma and gone home
[2:26:37] <MadOx__> this cut and paste shit rofl
[2:26:38] <%xemnahort> chat you guys are too much
[2:26:38] <DantesAnimus> is that guy wearin a femto mask??
[2:26:44] <+KoyaMusa> Get it she's redeemable now
[2:26:47] <unlimited_osteopath> what else do you need, man? That's all it takes
[2:26:48] <AJusticeLemon> is it the same throw animation from 1.0?
[2:26:48] <deviljhojho94> LUL
[2:26:50] <Shastafield> LUL
[2:26:52] <+rhapsodyinrose> Pat he's dead
[2:26:58] <unlimited_osteopath> ^
[2:26:58] <ELuscious> PAT SHOW YOUR TITIES Kreygasm
[2:26:59] <+Toblo1> Pat he got super killed
[2:26:59] <$Yakobro> HE'S DEAD PAT
[2:27:00] <deviljhojho94> Woolieng it up in here
[2:27:02] <+Ingenk> He got stoned to death pat
[2:27:03] <%PSOCecil> I've gotten angry eyes, mom.
[2:27:03] <crimsonharvest> Her whole shit is about refusing to take responsibility for her behavior.
[2:27:04] <zamzoph> WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FAAAACE
[2:27:05] <+travelmug> Beat up? he's dead
[2:27:10] <+Toblo1> HES SUPER DEAD
[2:27:14] <+gollum80> murder is justified if you don'
[2:27:18] <%TheBlackMandalorian> lol pats face rn
[2:27:20] <Village10> She doesn't understand that, its just her mom and dad. That said, I don't really feel to sorry because you know. The empire took over a country and regularly killed its citizens
[2:27:21] <+gollum80> don't like someone, eh?
[2:27:22] <damienlunas> @AngriestPat This whole cutscene actually made me less sympathetic to Fordola.
[2:27:26] <%Remery_> Yea Rage chunked that Rock super hard
[2:27:27] <%spacekataz18> That rock crit that guy
[2:27:29] <CatmanIX> if I were her I'd be more pissed at that soldier than the mob
[2:27:32] <+Felto3> ala mhigans were willing to stone a girl to death
[2:27:34] <msshakedown> I SMOLDER WITH GENERIC RAGE
[2:27:35] <+Slaardacity> who cares tho
[2:27:37] <+SailingSaturn> "I'm goning to go commit genocide now" cirLaugh
[2:27:38] <TheImmortal70> So WHY SERVE THEM
[2:27:43] <%PSOCecil> This cutscene made me hate the Ala'Mhigo people, honstly.
[2:27:46] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Yeah, with Fordola it's like.. "I understand, but that doesn't make it okay."
[2:27:48] <ELuscious> PogChamp
[2:27:49] <ragasquid> look at her face
[2:27:50] <%PSOCecil> Seriously, they just murdered a man.
[2:27:52] <ELuscious> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:27:53] <inksmears> pat has no feelings
[2:27:54] <zamzoph> IT'S TRAGIC PAT
[2:27:54] <ACriticalThink> @msshakedown Not generic rage :o
[2:27:54] <unlimited_osteopath> Mom is like "when did your voice get this intense?"
[2:27:55] <%spacekataz18> Next part so good tho
[2:27:57] <CybertronPrime> Rock Throw is super effective against Collaborator-types.
[2:27:59] <Vakojin> NO U STOOPID
[2:27:59] <$OmegaWeltall> yea.. Stormblood's storyline is.. mah
[2:28:00] <@thenefftw> She's a complete idiot
[2:28:00] <%TheBroletariat> Collaboration is justified when the opposing army is about 8 times stronger than your own. It saves wayyy more lives
[2:28:06] <+Toblo1> PAT ITS TRAAAAAAGIC
[2:28:06] <poodo89> "bye mom, time to genocide people unconnected to my fathers death!"
[2:28:07] <inksmears> PAT IT'S SAD BE SAD
[2:28:08] <%SSaryn> Well to be fair her Father was killed. But yes she is a complete idiot.
[2:28:09] <+Slaardacity> this is dumb
[2:28:09] <unlimited_osteopath> did this sour you to the game?
[2:28:10] <miguelrod777> I would genoc8de them too if that happend
[2:28:11] <ELuscious> FeelsBadMan
[2:28:16] <+KSabot> They Jiren'd her
[2:28:16] <ForlornHunter> I feel like what I know of this character this just makes me dislike her more.
[2:28:19] <+HeyBoston> the game wants it both ways
[2:28:23] <+jkcclemens> ffxiv villains have to be tragic! except the one good one
[2:28:31] <quitecross> >only 4.1, damn son catch up
[2:28:33] <@CreepyPorpoise> She's absolutely still a bad person, pat
[2:28:33] <Vakojin> No, she's bad
[2:28:33] <Metballs> No Pat
[2:28:35] <%SSaryn> Yeah, it's fucked up.
[2:28:36] <$TheNeedlesD> but shut up though
[2:28:37] <Metballs> She's still a monster
[2:28:40] <CatmanIX> not good, she's still clearly evil, even more so
[2:28:41] <+NYCrownlessKing> THEN WHY U LIKE THANOS Kappa @AngriestPat
[2:28:41] <Maldoree> Im with Pat on this one
[2:28:42] <+SailingSaturn> She kills her own men!
[2:28:42] <unlimited_osteopath> guess what, Pat, people often act out of stupidity and not sheer evil ffs
[2:28:43] <+Toblo1> SHES STILL DONE WARCRIMES PAT
[2:28:43] <+KoyaMusa> NAH BUT SHE HAD GOOD MOTIVATION THO
[2:28:44] <Metballs> Literally everyone still calls her a onster
[2:28:45] <inksmears> no pat she's bad but this is still sad
[2:28:45] <+Brewstamasta> Yeah BECAUSE shes dumb
[2:28:47] <wired_soul> not me
[2:28:47] <+rhapsodyinrose> No, the game still makes it clear she's bad
[2:28:47] <Vakojin> But she has her reason, she's not bad for the sake of evil
[2:28:49] <+Felto3> yeah, but they were ala mhigans, not people
[2:28:52] <Shastafield> when i squint the whole screen turns one color
[2:28:53] <+Ingenk> They’re just giving her a reason for her actions.
[2:28:55] <+ZakGaiGar> I mean, we killed a lot of people in game
[2:29:10] <%MisterCrimson> And that's why Xenos is a great villain. He's a totally irredeemable monster and he doesn't give a fuck
[2:29:11] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> She's bad, she just has various reasons. It doesn't redeem her, but she's not just seething with generic villainy
[2:29:12] <Schramjet> Yotsuyu had it way worse than Fordola
[2:29:12] <Silly_Duckling> if she had no reason, wouldn't that be worse writing?
[2:29:15] <+jkcclemens> big tragedy for big boys
[2:29:17] <@DreyfussFrost> Just showing where evil comes from.
[2:29:19] <Shinjima> cant please anyone nowadays
[2:29:22] <%SSaryn> They also didn't sugarcoat a lot of what happened to Yotsuyu as well, which makes it EVEN DUMBER
[2:29:22] <$TheNeedlesD> didn't you kill a lot too tho, for the experience?
[2:29:23] <%clausover> The naruto backstory
[2:29:24] <damienlunas> Xenos did nothing wrong
[2:29:26] <AJusticeLemon> bullied as a kid = genocide of your peoples
[2:29:28] <miguelrod777> yuzu was way more justified
[2:29:30] <%TheBroletariat> I agree with Tsuyu but Fordola's actions were super justified
[2:29:30] <zamzoph> kys
[2:29:31] <RangerJ95> @angriestpat did you ever finish Gundam Zeta?
[2:29:31] <ForlornHunter> Can we just kill her
[2:29:32] <+jkcclemens> zenos, not xenos
[2:29:45] <poodo89> xxenos
[2:29:45] <+Brewstamasta> Arenvald my boi
[2:29:49] <+rose_silver> Xzenos
[2:29:55] <+ChipZafari> XxXZenosXxX
[2:29:55] <+rhapsodyinrose> Arenvald best boi
[2:29:58] <unlimited_osteopath> ZeynoXx
[2:29:59] <%TheBroletariat> Fordola wasn't killing for fun she was killing because it would save more lives in the end
[2:30:00] <inksmears> she has the echo too
[2:30:02] <bleugh> idk seemed pretty tragic to me
[2:30:06] <Metballs> Well she has the echo too, remember
[2:30:09] <bielzitcho> still a bitch
[2:30:10] <Forester_Skippy> she can becasue she had the magitech echo operation
[2:30:19] <+KoyaMusa> We totally do though
[2:30:19] <zamzoph> PAT-RONIZE
[2:30:20] <+HeyBoston> YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
[2:30:21] <deviljhojho94> what's with the outfit
[2:30:25] <+Slaardacity> just kill her
[2:30:32] <%SSaryn> THEN WHY ARE YOU WITH GARLEANS BITCH
[2:30:32] <unlimited_osteopath> it's generic prisoner outfit
[2:30:33] <+Toblo1> Gotta give the VA props tho
[2:30:34] <ForlornHunter> Please
[2:30:34] <%Remery_> Father literally got rocked

[2:30:51] <ScrapSentinel> SHARINGAN
[2:30:51] <lord_winter_555> his name is patron that's what he does
[2:30:51] <+Shillk> oh no it's the sharingan
[2:30:52] <%PSOCecil> She's mad at the whole of Ala'Mhigo.
[2:30:52] <NoirePanzer> BECOME THE PERSON YOU HATE
[2:30:53] <FriendlyPatches> sharingan
[2:30:53] <+Toblo1> ITS ECHO FLASHBACKS ALL THE WAY DOWN
[2:30:54] <+Ingenk> Because how else is she supposed to get power
[2:30:56] <CatmanIX> I mean, he was a traitor though right?
[2:30:56] <+KSabot> no she wants to make the people pay
[2:30:58] <+CosmicGuitars> She's not mad at the guards, she's mad at Ala Mhigan loyalists
[2:31:00] <zamzoph> she has a geass D:
[2:31:02] <+DeadlyToastY> SHARINGAN
[2:31:05] <+quarkee> o the people she wants to make pay are the ala mhigans
[2:31:05] <TheImmortal70> "LOOK AT WHAT I"VE BEEN THROUGH BITCH"

[2:31:17] <+Toblo1> SEE OUR SUFFERING
[2:31:19] <%SSaryn> Here we go Pat. Here's the reason she's like this.
[2:31:30] <+rose_silver> 1.0 made us suffer too!!
[2:31:31] <Forester_Skippy> she only saw that now imagen the dark knight story line with that she would fucking implode
[2:31:32] <@thenefftw> All that pain that your character doesn't feel
[2:31:33] <+mik255> your story aint shit
[2:31:37] <crimsonharvest> too much for PUSSIES MAYBE
[2:31:40] <TheImmortal70> Now with a character change like this, THIS EVENT should've come first
[2:31:43] <%MisterCrimson> RIP Haurchefaunt, bestest boi
[2:31:47] <+HeyBoston> your character is a lifeless husk "ALL THAT PAIN"
[2:31:47] <DantesAnimus> Yeah get good bitch
[2:31:49] <TheImmortal70> She should've seen the bullshit you put up with before changing
[2:31:52] <captainthunderwolf> "Player character... how do you keep going on?"
[2:31:53] <poodo89> because im huge
[2:31:53] <@DreyfussFrost> You forgot the experiment they did on her near the end of 4.0 gave her the echo.

[2:31:58] <ForlornHunter> I don't feel pain.
[2:31:59] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> "Because I need to make the number get bigger."
[2:32:03] <%Tallie> basically fucking tposing at her
[2:32:03] <@thenefftw> Your character has no soul
[2:32:04] <damienlunas> Because I'm not a lil' BITCH
[2:32:05] <%SSaryn> Dude. Like... 3/4s of everyone in your story IS DEAD.
[2:32:06] <+DeadlyToastY> "For those cosmetic items girl"
[2:32:06] <%Remery_> BIG NUMBERS
[2:32:07] <fireking900> BECAUSE I LIE BIG NUMBERS
[2:32:09] <+Gregoryjk16> LUL
[2:32:09] <$spacehouse> beep boop i am a PROTA gON IST
[2:32:09] <ScrapSentinel> THAT SECOND ONE THO
[2:32:10] <fireking900> LIKE
[2:32:10] <zamzoph> DO THE NEO RESPONSE
[2:32:10] <unlimited_osteopath> "I did it for the loot"
[2:32:13] <+mik255> litereally allowed to cheat death
[2:32:16] <+Toblo1> BEEP BOOP I LOVE PAIN
[2:32:16] <miguelrod777> this English dub sucks
[2:32:17] <Metballs> ALWAYS THE SECOND one
[2:32:18] <+rose_silver> for the rare mount drop
[2:32:23] <CatmanIX> DETERMINATION
[2:32:24] <ThatRandomGuy661> Second reply the best reply
[2:32:27] <+Toblo1> For the Birds and/or Wolves
[2:32:28] <Kuroneko_x> sucks to suck 4Head
[2:32:29] <%Tallie> because i skipped all the cutscenes
[2:32:35] <Metballs> For those we may yet save...
[2:32:35] <+Blain_Cooper> For the Loot and the LOLs
[2:32:37] <+HeyBoston> meanwhile mook outside "BOY THIS DOOR SURE IS OPEN"
[2:32:38] <ScrapSentinel> That second reply might as well be the game's motto
[2:32:40] <ACriticalThink> Anime! *shakes fist
[2:32:43] <DantesAnimus> Headcanon is that u sound like an adult from The Peanuts
[2:32:44] <$Piemono> I feel like it's weirder to have mouth movements with no noise than to have no movements at all
[2:32:47] <%xemnahort> I like how pat starts ytoexplain and then the stream lags to cut him off
[2:32:48] <Vakojin> The time before the execution
[2:32:48] <Rngiddion> does she join your party? because that would be really stupid
[2:32:57] <redeq2> Be free in jail
[2:32:57] <%TheBroletariat> Their plan is to have a trial before the execute her
[2:33:04] <+Toblo1> The dreams of those who have fallen, the dreams of those who will follow
[2:33:06] <+SailingSaturn> Send her to the Salt Mines cirBaka
[2:33:06] <Forester_Skippy> that door closing animatio looked so bad
[2:33:09] <%Remery_> And now she rubs one out
[2:33:12] <@thenefftw> They better not Sasuke her
[2:33:16] <$Yakobro> @xemnahort not lagged atall :d
[2:33:17] <Forester_Skippy> hes also fucking dead finally
[2:33:18] <+mik255> hes a loser too
[2:33:23] <$Yakobro> @AngriestPat XENOS WAS TOO
[2:33:24] <%MisterCrimson> Don't worry, you'll be at her trial...
[2:33:24] <+natjen8> now we have Elidibius
[2:33:24] <@CreepyPorpoise> Pat can't deal with shades of gray, only black and white
[2:33:26] <@CreepyPorpoise> good and evil
[2:33:26] <+natjen8> to be Lahbrea
[2:33:28] <@JustinianKnight> Still plenty of just plain evil characters
[2:33:29] <Forester_Skippy> where the fuck did he come from in heavensward tho?
[2:33:30] <+JenovasPuppet> Nah the Ascians totally have a sob story.
[2:33:31] <+Ryuartyi_> Xenos was dope, too
[2:33:32] <bleugh> i've never played this and have no idea what's happening 4Head
[2:33:33] <redeq2> Punished
[2:33:33] <DrakeSilvos> So was Zenos
[2:33:34] <+Toblo1> Have we gotten any Ascian action for Storblood at all?
[2:33:35] <unlimited_osteopath> he was just a dude from Hot Topic, Pat
[2:33:37] <Shinjima> lahabrea was a pushover tho
[2:33:37] <CybertronPrime> SHHHH
[2:33:37] <unlimited_osteopath> that's all he was
[2:33:39] <+jkcclemens> just straight up evil villains are great. that's why zenos is best villain
[2:33:48] <+Blain_Cooper> @natjen8 Did you say edibles?
[2:33:48] <damienlunas> @AngriestPat Haven't you heard from the "Ascians did nothing wrong" people?
[2:33:49] <%TheBroletariat> Most of the community thinks Zenos is a bad reason because of that exact reason
[2:33:50] <milequetoaster> That's why everyone loves Xeno's
[2:33:54] <+CosmicGuitars> It could be worse. In a WoW novel they put Orc Hitler on trial but the end of it was 'IT WAS ACTUALLY _YOU_ WHO WAS ON TRIAL ALL ALONG, CHAMPION' and then Orc Hitler escaped
[2:33:55] <$Yakobro> @Toblo1 there's the emissary chatting up the emperor
[2:34:02] <+HeyBoston> those shades of gray suck
[2:34:04] <+HeyBoston> get new ones
[2:34:05] <Pappajimbo> hes evil and he loves it. you gotta respect that
[2:34:07] <Shastafield> LUL
[2:34:08] <@thenefftw> Unrepentant evil characters can be fun because they're evil AND THEY KNOW IT
[2:34:10] <TheImmortal70> Where's the grey in this fucking grey
[2:34:13] <Everpresent_Overseer> in the brain?
[2:34:20] <+JenovasPuppet> FFXIV rules: Guys can be evil, girls are always redeemable.
[2:34:23] <+SailingSaturn> She killed all those people and our friends
[2:34:26] <DantesAnimus> Why having Kamoshida be the first villain in P5 was genius. Just pure hate deserving villains are the strongest
[2:34:26] <Rngiddion> But the vicious war criminal has FEELINGS!
[2:34:28] <Metballs> Pat, it only works with what they're doing with Yotsuyu
[2:34:29] <ragasquid> i havent played the game so I have no opinions whatsoever
[2:34:31] <DrakeSilvos> Basically driving her mad
[2:34:38] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> But Nero was super redeemable
[2:34:38] <+Sir_Lune> Ilberd had a sad past and HE'S still an unquestionable bitch
[2:34:39] <+quarkee> yeah shes a prototype shes got ptoblems
[2:34:39] <+Slaardacity> so she Justified all that shit because her life was said and we responded with no fuck you my life was hard to and she went, oh ok i guess and backed down super hard
[2:34:42] <Metballs> Different levels of what can be redeemed
[2:34:45] <Shinjima> Gaius is best villain dont @ me!!!!
[2:34:47] <Maldoree> @Metballs thank you
[2:34:49] <$Yakobro> nero's the fucking best
[2:34:50] <Metballs> They act as a foil to the other
[2:34:59] <%MisterCrimson> I also like how nothing has adressed the fact that the Echo can let us control the god damn primals
[2:35:00] <%SGrim> @DantesAnimus Kamoshida did nothing right. DarkMode
[2:35:02] <+Andrizzleton> That Ixion mount is badass
[2:35:07] <CaptainSharkFace> You have a Kirin?
[2:35:16] <%spacekataz18> Oh man this place is great
[2:35:27] <Bloogoose> Thats some Jenova bullshit right there
[2:35:29] <Psyramics> check out that ominous music too
[2:35:31] <%spacekataz18> Check out how many fuckin bodies there are
[2:35:40] <DrakeSilvos> That Imperial bass
[2:35:41] <%Tenkay> Oh shit thats totally that FF7 jenova thing
[2:35:47] <+quarkee> CRY LE NOT KREE LE
[2:35:50] <%wizkid50000> Pat! I just beat Beyond: Two Souls! Much Sad!
[2:35:55] <Forester_Skippy> remember krile in here? the best character that got comatosed for some reason the whole story?
[2:35:56] <unlimited_osteopath> KURURU
[2:35:56] <%Remery_> Are we getting mother?
[2:36:09] <+Toblo1> This Mako Reactor-ass pod
[2:36:11] <MyDarkStorm> she got mako'ed
[2:36:15] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Lightly slapping the pod
[2:36:16] <$Yakobro> @Forester_Skippy and y'shtola :p
[2:36:16] <+Felto3> so many bodybags
[2:36:18] <+KoyaMusa> Why does he say Kreel
[2:36:18] <+Toblo1> Ooooohhhh god
[2:36:20] <Silly_Duckling> I want to buy Stormblood, but that shit is NEVER on sale (once in march, never again).
[2:36:25] <%HiroTSK5> "What does this pod say? Jenova?"
[2:36:27] <+mik255> its even an evil red color
[2:36:30] <Forester_Skippy> @yakobro literally who?
[2:36:35] <+quarkee> the fuck is he saying krile as kreele
[2:36:36] <$Yakobro> @Silly_Duckling I've seen it 50% off a few times
[2:36:39] <+Toblo1> So they just drained the aether/lifeforce of a bunch of people and slammed it all into one person?
[2:36:39] <DrakeSilvos> I think the SE store is having a sale right now.
[2:36:42] <+NickyDynamite> Pats pronunciation instincts are part of crazy tall
[2:36:44] <+Andrizzleton> This mako AF
[2:36:45] <milequetoaster> What the FUCK is that
[2:36:47] <+NickyDynamite> Talk
[2:36:56] <Mrthepastyrider> Pat's character looks like a literal gorilla.
[2:36:59] <%MisterCrimson> @AngriestPat take a look at all the tarps everywhere
[2:37:04] <+Toblo1> OH FUCK
[2:37:04] <ragasquid> damn this music
[2:37:05] <%TenderBabyBacon> Pat, why are you playing an anime. I came into this without having seen any of ffxiv and all I've seen is anime scenes
[2:37:06] <inksmears> jfc
[2:37:07] <Silly_Duckling> @Yakobro where? On steam it's only been on sale literally once, according to the metrics.
[2:37:08] <+Toblo1> THOSE ARE BODYBAGS
[2:37:20] <Maldoree> for every success a thousand are dead
[2:37:29] <$AzureGale> This music is reminding me of Ratchet & Clank :x
[2:37:37] <Jam643d> If you bought the original on steam, you gotta buy through steam. Otherwise, you can get a sale from pretty much anywhere
[2:37:48] <Jam643d> So Greenman, Amazon, Square's site, etc
[2:37:49] <FriendlyPatches> S U C C
[2:37:51] <Silly_Duckling> @Jam643d curses
[2:37:51] <DrakeSilvos> God not the Rhalgr's Ruin music
[2:37:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> they suck everything
[2:37:56] <+Toblo1> Succ and B l o w
[2:37:56] <+NostrTXB> S U C C
[2:38:02] <milequetoaster> @TenderBabyBacon He's doing all of the story quests, which are cutscene heavy
[2:38:08] <+Toblo1> The Autoblow: Aether edition
[2:38:12] <Jam643d> There's a chance the summer sale is gonna put it on some sale
[2:38:14] <crimsonharvest> so Fordola is Celes, but shitty?
[2:38:15] <%HiroTSK5> Krile from FFV?
[2:38:16] <%spacekataz18> When the echo nut and you succ too hard
[2:38:18] <unlimited_osteopath> Kreele
[2:38:19] <+Andrizzleton> The Matrix?
[2:38:19] <%TenderBabyBacon> @milequetoaster AH
[2:38:27] <+Toblo1> So she can't turn off the Echo's flashback function
[2:38:30] <+Toblo1> God that has to *SUCK*
[2:38:31] <+Blain_Cooper> @Toblo1 it won't electrocute your dick.
[2:38:34] <Metballs> Yeah, Hiro
[2:38:35] <+Kurogane_Dread> PAAAAT
[2:38:46] <Metballs> With the cat hood and everything
[2:38:46] <ForlornHunter> Good make her suffer more.
[2:38:50] <@DreyfussFrost> Oh huh. So this is when they explain that they gave her the echo. Thought that was explained in 4.0.
[2:38:51] <bielzitcho> sounds likea good punishment for her
[2:38:54] <%Remery_> Will it give you ghost powers
[2:39:00] <+Toblo1> Ya gotta turn the Echo off
[2:39:16] <@JustinianKnight> I think it was in 4.0 too
[2:39:26] <+natjen8> @DreyfussFrost they vaguely showed her being implanted, but I guess now they exploring the side effects more on someone who isnt the Warrior of Light
[2:39:44] <%Fidel_Castbro> No shut up though
[2:39:46] <%Fidel_Castbro> Lyse is great
[2:39:48] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Yeah, beating her echo using a weird staff was the whole point of a solo duty.
[2:39:49] <inksmears> because you never do anytjhing ever lyse!!!
[2:39:55] <+JenovasPuppet> Raubahn's got the best reason in the world say "Fuck Fordola," His life was just as hard, but he picked himself up by his bootstraps and got shit done.
[2:39:55] <CatmanIX> <sigh>
[2:39:56] <Forester_Skippy> raubhan also towers over a fucking roe with no efford
[2:39:58] <unlimited_osteopath> because you're useless, Lyse
[2:40:01] <Metballs> Wow
[2:40:02] <@DreyfussFrost> She definitely got her powers in 4.0 but I guess they didn't explain what they were.
[2:40:09] <unlimited_osteopath> I liked you better when you were Yda and you had a dick down there.
[2:40:10] <+CosmicGuitars> I'm glad Lyse is garbage instead of being hyper competent immediately, Yda was a big goof and they need to play into that more
[2:40:13] <@thenefftw> Potato
[2:40:15] <bielzitcho> mah boy pipin PogChamp
[2:40:16] <%Remery_> So Tiny
[2:40:17] <+Toblo1> Raubahn got dragged through the mud at least twice at this point
[2:40:19] <Metballs> Nanamo is precious
[2:40:24] <Metballs> Fuck you, Pat
[2:40:24] <Forester_Skippy> PIPIN EXTREME?!
[2:40:24] <wired_soul> pipin
[2:40:25] <damienlunas> They're one of the good ones
[2:40:28] <+Toblo1> HOW DARE YOU SLAG NANAMO
[2:40:29] <$Yakobro> FUCK YOU PAT
[2:40:29] <$OmegaWeltall> Namano should have stayed dead
[2:40:29] <+trez_> LUL
[2:40:33] <inksmears> PAT HAS NO EMOTIONS
[2:40:33] <bleugh> poteeto
[2:40:35] <unlimited_osteopath> FOR COIN AND COUNTRY, PAT
[2:40:35] <+UberWolfman> FUCK OFF
[2:40:37] <%wunderkindest> Oh is Pat a big Lala racist?
[2:40:37] <$OmegaWeltall> dont @ me

[2:40:38] <+Zundelle> it is time to care super hard
[2:40:38] <Texeu> PAT DONT DIS THE POTATO QUEEN!
[2:40:40] <%MisterCrimson> Lolorito's pretty cool
[2:40:40] <+alphonseisbest> hear hear
[2:40:41] <+terracornholio> heh
[2:40:43] <Silly_Duckling> Potato Rage
[2:40:44] <%CyborgAV> You suck Pat!
[2:40:51] <TheImmortal70> Pat has one emotion: goddammit why can you stay evil/dead
[2:40:54] <+NostrTXB> D: HOW DARE YOU
[2:40:55] <+JenovasPuppet> Pipin > Tataru > Papa Shan > all other Lalas.
[2:40:55] <fireking900> Potato racism
[2:40:55] <@DreyfussFrost> Nanamo is #1 you soulless potato.
[2:40:57] <@CreepyPorpoise> How can one man have so many wrong opinions?
[2:40:57] <+terracornholio> watch the viewer count drop
[2:41:01] <+SailingSaturn> Respect the Lala Queen cirBaka
[2:41:02] <$AzureGale> What unfitting quest complete music
[2:41:04] <AJusticeLemon> I cant believe they backed down SUPER HARD on her death
[2:41:10] <%titans_ace_jerid> Okay actual question, is Alphinaud a dude or a dudette?
[2:41:11] <inksmears> Big Nerd Alphy
[2:41:12] <%Remery_> The Lala Army
[2:41:15] <NeroCapone> and then they disappeared into the void
[2:41:16] <milequetoaster> Raubahn's sword is so big that Pipin has to hold it like a greatsword
[2:41:20] <unlimited_osteopath> Alphinaud is a dude.... dude.
[2:41:23] <$OmegaWeltall> i like Namano but.. her being "alseep" was a cheep cop out
[2:41:25] <milequetoaster> that's the coolest
[2:41:25] <+alphonseisbest> alps a dude
[2:41:25] <Vakojin> Dude with a dudette twin
[2:41:28] <maybeGabby> KICK ALL THE POTATOS :rage:
[2:41:33] <@thenefftw> Triple Traid!
[2:41:37] <%MisterCrimson> @titans_ace_jerid Alphinaud is a guy, his twin, Alisae is a grill
[2:41:39] <@DreyfussFrost> @titans_ace_jerid Alphi's a dude, he has an identical twin sister though. They both look like girls.
[2:41:39] <@JustinianKnight> Star is if they still have cards you need
[2:41:40] <+Blain_Cooper> TRIPLE TRIAAAAD
[2:41:41] <grayjammer> t r i p l e t r i a d
[2:41:43] <%Laecerelius> TRIPLE TRIAAAAAAAD!!
[2:41:44] <+rose_silver> it means you haven't won their card
[2:41:46] <Vakojin> Cause it's a card you don't have
[2:41:47] <bielzitcho> he probably has cards you haven't earned yet
[2:41:47] <+Toblo1> Basically they still have Cards you can unlock
[2:41:47] <+S14y3d> oh they changed it so if you need cards it shows that
[2:41:47] <+Felto3> they have stars if you haven't got all the cards
[2:41:48] <%titans_ace_jerid> Fucking anime.
[2:41:48] <Metballs> Tells you if you have to beat them
[2:41:48] <+JonesInTheFastLane> Means they have a card you dont
[2:41:49] <$OmegaWeltall> you havent got the card from him
[2:41:51] <bielzitcho> or something like that
[2:41:52] <Metballs> Or if they have unclaimed rewards
[2:41:53] <TheEvilOmega> Shuffle and boogie, guys. Shuffle and boogie.
[2:41:54] <+arknodem> Star means you still have things to get from them.
[2:41:55] <Forester_Skippy> they did that if you didnt obtained the card prize from them yet
[2:42:02] <+NostrTXB> @pat you beat him but didnt get card
[2:42:04] <+S14y3d> they also got rid of the time limits on them
[2:42:05] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Hmm, if only there were notes somewhere that told you what was added to the game.
[2:42:09] <+S14y3d> so you can do them at any time now
[2:42:12] <+Shillk> nicew
[2:42:13] <%Remery_> <3
[2:42:14] <+S14y3d> instead of having to wait for them to be open
[2:42:15] <Mrthepastyrider> Can this character touch his head or wipe his own ass? His arms are like tree trunks.
[2:42:16] <inksmears> "got stuck in the catgirls"
[2:42:16] <JingoJungler> Kreygasm
[2:42:17] <@thenefftw> Pat gets stuck in cat girls, eh?
[2:42:19] <$OmegaWeltall> stay away from teh cat girl section...
[2:42:20] <+HeyBoston> "got stuck in the catgirls" rip
[2:42:20] <bielzitcho> ul'dah's theme is so good...
[2:42:21] <+gollum80> stuck in the cat girls Kreygasm
[2:42:21] <+Blain_Cooper> stuck in a catgirl
[2:42:21] <ragasquid> nyaa
[2:42:28] <fireking900> i get stuck in cat girls all the time
[2:42:29] <Silly_Duckling> Pat: Catgirls+, Potatoes-
[2:42:29] <+Toblo1> Also I think they're just open to Card matches *whenever* now?
[2:42:32] <unlimited_osteopath> use the teleport, Pat gatdamn, son
[2:42:32] <$AzureGale> "I got stuck in the catgirls" - Pat
[2:42:33] <%Remery_> Cat girls annieSwoon
[2:42:33] <+Mistheart101> Pat got stuck in Elmo's sister
[2:42:35] <Metballs> Fast travel is for cowards
[2:42:36] <@JustinianKnight> TT is no longer time locked either
[2:42:37] <damienlunas> It's those barbs. They make it harder to pull out.
[2:42:41] <+Toblo1> I could be *way* off tho
[2:42:41] <RaidenTheBloodEdge> So that's why Pat fears Nekopara...
[2:42:42] <$OmegaWeltall> Miqote was a mistake
[2:42:44] <Vakojin> Yeah
[2:42:49] <Vakojin> Sam quest
[2:42:51] <$OmegaWeltall> Au Ra were a HUGE mistake
[2:42:52] <+Kurogane_Dread> lalafell was a mistakr
[2:42:52] <+JenovasPuppet> "I got stuck in the Catgirls" - JAVtitles
[2:43:00] <+Toblo1> but I like playing a Miqo'te tho
[2:43:05] <PopdropGardner> so was Lahabrea the guy in 2.0 or is he the white guy?
[2:43:05] <TheEvilOmega> My cat girl is awesome...
[2:43:09] <Village10> Au Ra are the best
[2:43:11] <Forester_Skippy> @RaidenTheBloodEdge that and because of takahata
[2:43:16] <%MisterCrimson> When you realize that inter-racial relationships are very much cannon in this game, "stuck in the catgirls" as a Roe is offputting
[2:43:17] <Heartlander> There's never any appreciation for Elezen.
[2:43:24] <+S14y3d> au ra are both the worst and the best. male au ra look terrible
[2:43:26] <PopdropGardner> this was a question i forgot to ask lmao
[2:43:27] <unlimited_osteopath> surprised you didn't pronounce her name like NAYNEYNMOE or something
[2:43:28] <fireking900> people WutFace
[2:43:29] <@thenefftw> Potato
[2:43:31] <damienlunas> I think that's from the PLD Stormblood quest?
[2:43:31] <$OmegaWeltall> female au ra is a lazy design
[2:43:35] <+Toblo1> @PopdropGardner I think he was one of the Ascians we killed during ARR's Patchgame
[2:43:36] <Ell1ot> is that a Potato?
[2:43:38] <%SSaryn> Nanamo is the only acceptable Potato.
[2:43:39] <%MisterCrimson> @Heartlander because elves are douches
[2:43:39] <JingoJungler> what is that thing
[2:43:40] <+arknodem> QUICK POISON HER AGAIN!!!
[2:43:41] <ArgentUndaCova> :)
[2:43:43] <milequetoaster> Is her VA different
[2:43:44] <+quarkee> hey its best girl
[2:43:45] <dontfeedthechocobo> VoHiYo
[2:43:45] <ragasquid> lmao that face
[2:43:47] <%SSaryn> PAT
[2:43:49] <Village10> @Heartlander what are those things, are those the thing with the pointy ears

[2:45:22] <+Toblo1> @SpaceCaptainCrone I mean thats kinda a given when it comes to female Lalafells at this point
[2:45:28] <%Remery_> How did the Lalafell race not go extinct with there small size?
[2:45:30] <$OmegaWeltall> @Village10 yea.. thats my main gripe... ugh

[2:48:26] <PopdropGardner> why did I ask a question, I meant to exclaim that
[2:48:27] <+S14y3d> just facerolls on a keyboard
[2:48:31] <%xemnahort> remember when her eyes went blank, she choked, fell over and super died but then they said she just went into a coma
[2:48:34] <%SSaryn> Well Ragged is true, but not poor.
[2:48:38] <unlimited_osteopath> the man with 14mil

[2:49:15] <+JenovasPuppet> Nanamo is doing her best!
[2:49:15] <+UberWolfman> Shes literally reflecting on her job as a ruler.
[2:49:17] <+Shillk> pat watch out those hornets will fuck you up
[2:49:17] <Bloogoose> Yo it's the best song in the game
[2:49:27] <$AzureGale> Some things never change
[2:49:29] <PopdropGardner> Is he reading the text?
[2:49:37] <bielzitcho> i started in ul'dah. it'll always be special to me
[2:49:38] <unlimited_osteopath> he's reading it wrong lol
[2:49:39] <%SSaryn> Limsa is still one of the better Town songs in my opinion.
[2:49:40] <%GarbageNirvana> The Patron is a creature in which empathy does not seem to exist
[2:49:42] <+Wrashis> is there a way to actually find out when a prime sub is ready?
[2:49:44] <KittenHachiChan18> Are those giant ants?
[2:49:47] <+rose_silver> You guys ever notice, there are no toilets in eorzea

[2:49:55] <Bloogoose> PAT IS LITERALLY TORCHING ANTS
[2:49:56] <Silly_Duckling> reason is the first thing to go when Potato Racism is involved Kappa
[2:49:57] <@JustinianKnight> You should know Pat doesn't read
[2:49:58] <alextrebeken> how does healing work in this game, like how do you select your target
[2:50:03] <MyDarkStorm> how did you get your hot bar to look that way?
[2:50:03] <KittenHachiChan18> I havem't seen bugs that big since Fallout.
[2:50:11] <Forester_Skippy> all ants are giant compaired to pat
[2:50:12] <%wunderkindest> I miss the Antica from FFXI
[2:50:13] <dontfeedthechocobo> we hunterxhunter now Kappa
[2:50:15] <Metballs> These are the small ones
[2:50:17] <+Mistheart101> @JustinianKnight It's more like he doesn't know how to read sometimes
[2:50:28] <DrakeSilvos> Just wait til you see the giant spiderhawks.
[2:50:32] <+Kain5707> what barding was that
[2:50:33] <zamzoph> rocks fall
[2:50:36] <ae_moth> i hope we get a teaser for what new job they're probably adding in the next expansion with 4.3
[2:50:36] <KittenHachiChan18> OH that;s bad . . .
[2:50:37] <%MisterCrimson> "rock slide"
[2:50:38] <+HeyBoston> a rockslide from the empire
[2:50:45] <+Mistheart101> Okay so they got murdered, got it
[2:50:46] <ae_moth> blue mage/beastmaster tank hype
[2:50:46] <+Shillk> how could the rocks hit them, they're such small targets
[2:50:48] <KittenHachiChan18> ARE THOSE FROGS?!
[2:50:48] <%SSaryn> @alextrebeken through the F1-8 keys or clicking on people, you can also bind them.
[2:50:51] <unlimited_osteopath> the fuck were her parents doing there anyway? Atma farming?
[2:50:54] <+JenovasPuppet> A rock slide by the name of Lolorito.
[2:50:55] <Bloogoose> Rock Slide Raid incoming
[2:50:57] <Jam643d> We probably won't see new job teasers until fanfest in october
[2:50:58] <zamzoph> democracy DansGame
[2:50:59] <bielzitcho> not frogs, toads
[2:51:04] <KittenHachiChan18> Either way they're HUGE
[2:51:06] <+Ingenk> She’s was like 10 pat
[2:51:07] <+rose_silver> democracy is a failure, just look at america
[2:51:08] <rosemon5001> DICTATORIAL rule for all!!!!
[2:51:17] <mr_slaide> But is it as bad as the democracy in The legend of the galactic heroes?
[2:51:17] <%MisterCrimson> It's almost like a capitalsit controlled democracy is a bad idea...
[2:51:21] <unlimited_osteopath> Pat you are literally talking down to a potato monarch
[2:51:21] <alextrebeken> @SSaryn he's playing with controler tho
[2:51:26] <KittenHachiChan18> What IS this game?! Why the Fallout creatures?! And where can I get this majestic game?!
[2:51:37] <%xemnahort> nature used rock slide, it was super effective, parents have fainted... forever
[2:51:40] <$i_am_therydon> well when she weighs 30 pounds sure its easy to carry her
[2:51:41] <ragasquid> Pat bullying the only thing smaller than him
[2:51:43] <+Zdarma88> literally just look out a window nanamo
[2:51:46] <$TheNeedlesD> could be worse, you could've been playing WoW, Pat
[2:51:46] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Just living that Dark Knight life
[2:51:47] <+JenovasPuppet> Pat forgot how to aetheryte.
[2:51:48] <inksmears> ALISAIE BEST GIRL
[2:51:54] <+Ryuartyi_> Exactly
[2:51:55] <basedduwang> I see that Pat too has no taste.
[2:51:55] <%SSaryn> @alextrebeken With that, I don't know. I assume you can scroll through your party list somehow with Controller and that'd be how.
[2:51:55] <+KoyaMusa> @AngriestPat Wait till 4.2 you're gonna have a FIELD DAY
[2:51:58] <inksmears> BLESS U PAT
[2:51:58] <zamzoph> people love monarchies! Didn't you see the royal wedding viewer numbers? Kappa
[2:52:00] <inksmears> I AGREE
[2:52:01] <Ser_Randal> its pottery
[2:52:05] <+Shillk> pat did you see the dissidia store in kingdom hearts 3
[2:52:05] <crimsonharvest> Yshtola's so fashionable and competent
[2:52:06] <ChronoCanti> Agreed
[2:52:06] <DrakeSilvos> And Cid
[2:52:06] <%Fidel_Castbro> I disagree
[2:52:07] <Forester_Skippy> ehhh y'stola is kinda boring msot of the time
[2:52:08] <Metballs> Tatatu tho
[2:52:08] <CashewZero> Pat, I see you too are a man of good taste
[2:52:08] <Phantonbat> I disagree
[2:52:08] <unlimited_osteopath> Y'shtota is so fucking bad, though
[2:52:09] <+jishjoshjash> Alphinaud > Alisiae, fight me.
[2:52:09] <+Kain5707> you forgot Estinien
[2:52:10] <mr_slaide> Y'shtola is best girl.
[2:52:10] <+furiousfurioso> truth
[2:52:11] <+TheShal> What about Thancred?
[2:52:12] <milequetoaster> Alphinaud is way better
[2:52:13] <+rose_silver> I'm happy if I can stare at nanamos face all day
[2:52:13] <+Toblo1> Tataru tho
[2:52:14] <bielzitcho> y'shtola is shit
[2:52:14] <+TheShal> And Alphi?
[2:52:14] <Bloogoose> I disagree
[2:52:14] <Shinjima> Gaius is the best
[2:52:15] <KittenHachiChan18> If this is what the Final Fantasy games are like then WOW I HAVE BEEN INTO THE WRONG SERIES
[2:52:17] <basedduwang> Y'shtola does 0 and Alisaie is a mary sue.
[2:52:17] <%SSaryn> Y'
[2:52:18] <%MisterCrimson> or Estinien
[2:52:19] <alextrebeken> @SSaryn lol ya thats where i was getting tripped up
[2:52:20] <Bloogoose> Alphinaud >>> Alisaie
[2:52:22] <milequetoaster> and Y'shtola is super boring
[2:52:23] <Shinjima> GAIUS #1
[2:52:24] <Aeonknight_87> @AngriestPat you forgot yugiri
[2:52:24] <%SSaryn> Y'sthola is great FUCK OFF.
[2:52:25] <+Felto3> y'shtola does nothing
[2:52:27] <Thansrider> I know some people who would argue for Estinien.
[2:52:28] <AJusticeLemon> I also cant believe they benched Yshtola to give more light to Lyse

[2:55:52] <Metballs> She saved his life
[2:55:55] <+jishjoshjash> The people running the pits set Raubahn up to die by fighting like 10 dudes, and Nanamo went "no, that's really unfair". That's why.
[2:55:55] <+Toblo1> And not be an absolute dick like everyone else in Ul'dah is

[2:55:59] <Metballs> He was in a rigged match

[2:56:05] <Metballs> And she said "Nah, fight fair"
[2:56:06] <+KoyaMusa> pat knows nothing about the world of ffxiv

[3:00:14] <bielzitcho> @PopdropGardner you give him a massage or something like that, i think
[3:00:16] <+furiousfurioso> pats fucking eyes lit up when he saw Godberts name
[3:00:17] <@DreyfussFrost> @PopdropGardner Yes, at Camp Bronze Lake at one point.
[3:00:20] <+Toblo1> @PopdropGardner Yeah, you've had at least a couple run-ins with him outside of the Hildibrand questlines
[3:00:20] <basedduwang> she has, she literally says she has

[3:00:42] <+Wrashis> gold saucer hype
[3:00:48] <KittenHachiChan18> Was that town in the shape of a CACTAUR.
[3:00:49] <PopdropGardner> ah cool, I was wondering if the response would be different if you skipped the Hildy quests
[3:00:50] <%MisterCrimson> @ThatRandomGuy661 Godbert is the only MSQ
[3:00:51] <TioXyco> That golden saucer theme
[3:00:57] <+Ilpala271> Pat's gonna be so mad at the end of this patch
[3:00:57] <KittenHachiChan18> Nope
[3:01:00] <@JustinianKnight> *warps away from the free travel to GS*
[3:01:04] <+JenovasPuppet> What do the Chinese players do in this part?
[3:01:06] <Forester_Skippy> but she sneaks out all the time tho

[3:01:31] <damienlunas> No no no! Wrong Way!
[3:01:32] <Vakojin> !uptime
[3:01:32] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 1m 41s.
[3:01:33] <+Toblo1> @PopdropGardner At least it makes it funnier in my head because doing the Hildibrand quests just makes me think "Yes, we're *way* too antiquated with the Mandervilles"
[3:01:40] <+Toblo1> *Aquainted
[3:01:49] <%RaikenTB> apatBig apatCanada
[3:01:50] <+JenovasPuppet> Fashion is below you.

[3:02:26] <%AbnormalVoid> Colornel Sanders?
[3:02:30] <KittenHachiChan18> OH WOW
[3:02:31] <+JonesInTheFastLane> Im surprised he's wearing pants
[3:02:32] <+Mistheart101> "You're wearing clothes today" I think I need context for why Pat said that thing specifically
[3:02:33] <Forester_Skippy> he isnt in goldsmithing/combat mode so yeah he does wear em
[3:02:34] <unlimited_osteopath> a coif, or, as Woolie would pronounce it, a KEFF
[3:02:34] <$AzureGale> wat
[3:02:39] <%titans_ace_jerid> Fantasy Colonel Sanders here.
[3:02:40] <+alphonseisbest> @angriestpat is the WOL the most powerful person in FF14?
[3:02:48] <Morsuzado> hotpants aren't business formal
[3:02:49] <KittenHachiChan18> Oh man he looks like a badass! XD
[3:02:52] <DrakeSilvos> No Godbert is.
[3:02:53] <poodo89> nah godbert is
[3:02:56] <+JenovasPuppet> Laying the smackdown!
[3:02:58] <+Toblo1> Dang
[3:03:00] <ThePlotHole> He's right tho
[3:03:00] <%SSaryn> WHAT A BIG SURPRISE
[3:03:03] <bielzitcho> telling her like it is!
[3:03:04] <fireking900> oh
[3:03:05] <%spacekataz18> Godbert knows
[3:03:06] <%SSaryn> GODBERT KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING
[3:03:08] <ae_moth> i love this scene because even though Godbert is really goofy, he knows business and knows it well

[3:03:19] <+Kiyosuki> gasp pat playing 14. PogChamp
[3:03:20] <+Toblo1> Godbert may be goofy, but he's not stupid

[3:03:35] <Forester_Skippy> PAT HES ON THE SYNDICATE HE KNOWS WTF
[3:03:39] <mr_slaide> He's not wrong.
[3:03:44] <+Kiyosuki> Godbert is aptly named
[3:03:48] <inksmears> he has a good point tho
[3:03:52] <+Mistheart101> Oh
[3:03:54] <KittenHachiChan18> And there's the main hit.
[3:03:55] <+Mistheart101> That's a good point yes
[3:03:55] <crimsonharvest> Uldah needs Infrastructure Week
[3:03:56] <Neoripo> You shit on Godbert, but he didn't become millionaire just because
[3:03:58] <+HelloImTom08> he's one of the richest person in uldah. he aint dumb
[3:04:00] <Metballs> It's easy to forget that Godbert isn't just a suplex machine. He's also one of teh richest men in the world and a fantastic businessman.
[3:04:01] <+Ryuartyi_> He's not wrong
[3:04:12] <%GarbageNirvana> Give 'em jobs
[3:04:14] <KittenHachiChan18> Oh wow this got political really fast.
[3:04:18] <+Shillk> why does he have krillin dots
[3:04:19] <unlimited_osteopath> give them job stones
[3:04:19] <%GarbageNirvana> Is basically what it boils down to
[3:04:25] <Metballs> The entire FFXIV story is politics
[3:04:26] <+Kiyosuki> Godbert is basically everything his son isn't. Kappa
[3:04:27] <Tootall6537> For coin and country
[3:04:27] <inksmears> ff14 always gets political real fast
[3:04:28] <milequetoaster> Now to talk to the worst dude
[3:04:29] <KittenHachiChan18> Did you just get gold for talking politics?
[3:04:29] <crimsonharvest> Well he told you not to coddle the refugees, maybe create a public works project instead
[3:04:31] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> So her plan to give all the refugees Amazon gift cards has gone up in smoke.
[3:04:34] <kaihuevos> @AngriestPat That text is so tiny how do you read it if you're so blind?
[3:04:35] <+Toblo1> XIV can get Political real quickly
[3:04:36] <mr_slaide> That's some Kotor 2 Kreia mentality.
[3:04:36] <Intolerable> He looks lkke an anime colonel sanders
[3:04:39] <%spacekataz18> Then you would say RIOT
[3:04:39] <+Toblo1> Both in main and sub-story
[3:04:42] <milequetoaster> who is pretty great besides
[3:04:42] <DrakeSilvos> This is a bit similar to what she does in the SB GSM quests.
[3:04:45] <%SSaryn> NO SHUT UP
[3:04:45] <+JenovasPuppet> I'm 1/8 Ala Mhigan, can I have free money?
[3:04:51] <mrjohncarlton> They know you would spend it on space hats Pat
[3:04:52] <unlimited_osteopath> shut up pay me
[3:04:55] <%SGrim> The government of crime LUL
[3:04:57] <+HelloImTom08> its not crime if o\you make it legal
[3:04:59] <+crimsonberry255> The moogles just floating around during tense conversation lol sbfpRichard
[3:04:59] <@DreyfussFrost> Because she hates the monetarists. MONEY KILLED HER PARENTS
[3:04:59] <+TheShal> BIG crime
[3:05:04] <Shinmaddrox> Did she ever claim to be good at her job of being useless
[3:05:04] <%MisterCrimson> I feel like this whole quest line is designed to lampoon American ideologies
[3:05:08] <mr_slaide> Hancock is best cock.
[3:05:09] <ragasquid> this game is really interesting if you have no idea what the fuck is going on
[3:05:10] <unlimited_osteopath> you gon talk to Will Smith now
[3:05:13] <Fynale> i can't wait to see what pat thinks of the solution of this patch
[3:05:13] <KittenHachiChan18> XD
[3:05:15] <zamzoph> legalized crime
[3:05:19] <+Mistheart101> @DreyfussFrost So were those boulders made of coins?
[3:05:23] <@DreyfussFrost> A big gold coin came up to them in an alley and stabbed them to death.
[3:05:25] <ACriticalThink> What is this amine?
[3:05:25] <Jam643d> Doesn't mean she was good at it
[3:05:26] <+c_puppy> we live in a society
[3:05:26] <mr_slaide> The best of crimes.
[3:05:28] <Jam643d> She got poisoned
[3:05:31] <%Northan> cheer1000 hey pat i just got back from a chinese buffet. Fortune cookie said I'd have a pleasant surprise soon and found 10 bux on the ground on the way back to my car. You take it.
[3:05:33] <Forester_Skippy> half the crime is by the cops
[3:05:34] <mr_slaide> She's terrible.
[3:05:36] <+Shillk> the only good rulers are villains
[3:05:37] <Shastafield> we live in a society
[3:05:37] <Morsuzado> worst potato
[3:05:37] <Neoripo> Fuck the monetarists
[3:05:38] <Fynale> well i mean she's like 18
[3:05:38] <+Toblo1> Theres a reason she's been a puppet ruler
[3:05:38] <milequetoaster> The Syndicate isn't inherently crime
[3:05:38] <Forester_Skippy> and the flames cant stop them
[3:05:38] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Why would the "Monetarists" care about money? Honestly, Pat.
[3:05:40] <+Slaardacity> Is this Communism?
[3:05:42] <Metballs> ALmost like she was raised from birth to be a puppet
[3:05:43] <%mik255> shes been ruling since she was 5 pat
[3:05:45] <+crimsonberry255> You don't talk about my waifu like that!
[3:05:45] <+NostrTXB> rip popoto
[3:05:45] <+KoyaMusa> Pat doesn't even know
[3:05:45] <%xemnahort> @AngriestPat and this is why raubahn doesn't want to leave her alone she's worse off than Lyse
[3:05:47] <+Toblo1> And the Syndicate can run rings around her
[3:05:48] <+natjen8> The syndicate knoiws
[3:05:48] <+HelloImTom08> its like she is a pupppet monarch who is a dumb
[3:05:50] <+Toblo1> Well, could
[3:05:51] <+TheShal> She rules a country that has the motto "FOR COIN AND COUNTRY"
[3:05:51] <%SSaryn> Raubahn lived through this shit to be fair.
[3:05:53] <mr_slaide> Lalafells are the worst.
[3:05:54] <%Fenrirlives> @AngriestPat show off your fancy laser spirit sword Pat!
[3:05:54] <Thansrider> Ul'dah, Biggest exports: Money and crimes
[3:05:54] <%MisterCrimson> Aymerics got it on lock though
[3:05:55] <KittenHachiChan18> I'm pretty sure someone has this written out politcally. Give me like five minutes I'll find something
[3:05:55] <Vakojin> She's 10 years old PAT
[3:05:55] <+JenovasPuppet> Nanamo may be terrible, but she's still better than Kan-e-Senna and Merlwyb!
[3:05:56] <+Kiyosuki> That's why she's doing this though.
[3:05:57] <+rose_silver> the best rulers are often corrupt, and the worst rulers are often nice and kind
[3:05:58] <unlimited_osteopath> Raubhan is a filthy gladiator. You think he knows about governing people?
[3:05:59] <+Toblo1> She's *effectively* dead
[3:05:59] <%spacekataz18> Minfilia knew how to get fucking kidnapped
[3:06:00] <TioXyco> Noobody knows what they doing... JUST LIKE REAL POLITICS
[3:06:01] <$Yakobro> SPOILERS
[3:06:02] <DrakeSilvos> Sorta
[3:06:05] <ForlornHunter> Most of these rulers seem like airheads
[3:06:07] <Mastigias> Gridania seems to be doing fine with their ruler.
[3:06:07] <%Remery_> Lalafells are a strange race
[3:06:10] <+Kiyosuki> I was glad they actually addressed this about her with this quest line
[3:06:15] <zamzoph> choking on potatoes
[3:06:15] <KittenHachiChan18> COLONIALISM THAT'S IT

[3:06:19] <@DreyfussFrost> She's worse than dead, she's written out of the plot. That's like super-death.
[3:06:20] <poodo89> lalafells are the worst man
[3:06:20] <KittenHachiChan18> And you need a Ricola?
[3:06:20] <crimsonharvest> Pat dies for our pleasure live on steam
[3:06:20] <fireking900> ITS HAPPENING
[3:06:20] <$TheNeedlesD> Pat poisoned himself!
[3:06:20] <CatmanIX> elect raubaun as god emporer of all nations?
[3:06:21] <%SSaryn> Minfilla is basically a weird half and half between a Warrior of Light AND a weird Crystal Lady.
[3:06:21] <Shinmaddrox> @unlimited_osteopath He probably knows better then her
[3:06:22] <+HelloImTom08> send halp

[3:06:29] <+Ilpala271> Tataru best girl
[3:06:31] <unlimited_osteopath> @Shinmaddrox doubt it.
[3:06:35] <DrakeSilvos> The poison backfired.
[3:06:36] <KittenHachiChan18> Shit that sounds bad.
[3:06:37] <+natjen8> she's like 30 i think

[3:06:48] <milequetoaster> she's 25 I think
[3:06:49] <+Toblo1> Hydaelyn had enough of your racism
[3:06:50] <Fynale> @AngriestPat she's 18 her parents died when she was like 8 or something
[3:06:50] <%xemnahort> quick chug a red bull to survive
[3:06:50] <TheImmortal70> She's definitely not a child

[3:06:53] <Mariakko> She's old enough
[3:06:53] <%mik255> she was ruling since she was 5

[3:07:25] <+c_puppy> the worst lore in this entire game is this lalafell nonsense

[3:07:44] <BlueVexer> Seems that Nanamo is 25.
[3:07:44] <$OmegaWeltall> yep.. i FUCKING HATE the quest system in this game.. teleport EVERYWHERE!!!
[3:07:45] <Fynale> sadly the good guys make him more money
[3:07:45] <@DreyfussFrost> Lolorito wasn't the bad guy, that was Teledji Adeledji.
[3:07:47] <zamzoph> I was going to play Wolfenstein 2, but I'm enamored by Pat getting mad
[3:07:50] <+natjen8> @GarbageNirvana he saved Nanamo's life
[3:07:53] <+Mistheart101> I think y'all need to understand I don't know shit about fuck and got here like an hour ago
[3:07:54] <Metballs> Built a statue of himself outside the SCion base
[3:07:56] <mr_slaide> Lolorito did nothing wrong.
[3:07:58] <damienlunas> @AngriestPat it's cool, Lolorito gave Nanamo a huuuuge bribe to apologize.
[3:07:58] <Metballs> Out of pure spite
[3:08:01] <%SSaryn> I can't wait for this.

[3:08:20] <%MisterCrimson> technically, Lolorito saved your life, bitch
[3:08:21] <@DreyfussFrost> TONS of people confuse Lolorito and Teledji. Teledji was the one that tried to kill nanamo.
[3:08:27] <Metballs> Teledji is a hero
[3:08:28] <milequetoaster> Lolorito was actually the smartest guy in this damn story
[3:08:30] <+crimsonberry255> Sounds about right
[3:08:33] <Morsuzado> so lolorito tried to set you up and embarass you in a high profile dinner as a cook. That, and he was involved in an assassination attempt that had you and all your friends as fall guys.

[3:17:35] <KittenHachiChan18> CHOCOBOS CAN FLY?!
[3:17:38] <+Wrashis> aww ye
[3:17:41] <Aeonknight_87> @nyterayce what kind of tips. gameplay, how2makemoney, what
[3:17:53] <mr_slaide> Sempai noticed you Wrashis!
[3:17:54] <%xemnahort> @KittenHachiChan18 when you train them up yes
[3:17:57] <crimsonharvest> Chocobos can fly, and these days its not just limited to black ones.
[3:18:00] <%RaikenTB> Use the thunderhorse instead.
[3:18:03] <%CitrusDrink> Which barding is that?
[3:18:03] <Pritswalk> no its fine
[3:18:05] <KittenHachiChan18> But . . . their mass ratio!
[3:18:08] <KittenHachiChan18> And their winfs!
[3:18:12] <+Ilpala271> @nyterayce have fun, do as many/few sidequests as you like, but main story should get you a vast majority of the exp you need to progress
[3:18:15] <+Ciphris> how the salt get there pat
[3:18:18] <ae_moth> there is plenty of salt in Rabanastre
[3:18:18] <mr_slaide> No. Shut up. IT's everywhere.
[3:18:19] <+HelloImTom08> yea but everyone needs salt, its free money
[3:18:19] <%Remery_> There's a lot PAt
[3:18:19] <+KSabot> the dirt is salt
[3:18:19] <Jam643d> Looks like it might be the susano barding?
[3:18:19] <+nyterayce> i installed it and as far as i got was class with random city
[3:18:20] <+rose_silver> you'de be suprised how much salt there is
[3:18:21] <%mik255> you can literally say that about any industry pat
[3:18:23] <Jonesman64> its all the salt from people trying to do Pub Raids Kappa
[3:18:23] <inksmears> pat.... no.....
[3:18:24] <%spacekataz18> That's a LOT of salt
[3:18:24] <DrakeSilvos> They'll get more salt from the players.
[3:18:26] <+alphonseisbest> @aeonknight_87 look up mrhappy plays. he got newbies covered
[3:18:28] <+Mistheart101> It's fine it's the remnants of Maddentown, Pat.
[3:18:29] <BigNerdSam> the salt doesn't come from the dirt, it comes from the miners.
[3:18:29] <Worldbrand> you are underestimating the FGC, pat
[3:18:30] <SirDogBear> their tears will provide the rest of the salt
[3:18:30] <$AzureGale> There's infinity salt in the video game mines
[3:18:30] <milequetoaster> Salt is astonishingly renewable
[3:18:32] <TheImmortal70> The entire ground is 100% pure salt
[3:18:32] <crimsonharvest> @KittenHachiChan18 properly motivated even the Fat Chocobo can fly
[3:18:33] <Metballs> Kitten, they literally fly through the power of determination
[3:18:36] <Morsuzado> and salt was worth it's weight in gold long ago.
[3:18:38] <+EmoLlama> half the zone is made of salt, they're gonna be fine
[3:18:38] <+nyterayce> what is a nice dps class
[3:18:39] <Forester_Skippy> dont worry about it why are you wqorried about this pyramid sceme so raubhan fucks off from ul dah?
[3:18:48] <General_Terro> pat 80% of the area map is just a big pile of salt
[3:18:49] <CatmanIX> pat, there are salt mines in the real world smaller than this that run for decades
[3:18:49] <$AzureGale> Pat is emitting a lot of salt right now
[3:18:49] <fireking900> Pat you have infinite salt they can just mine you
[3:18:50] <Thansrider> The Last king kinda cursed the Lakes to be almost entirely salt.
[3:18:50] <Pritswalk> pat looks like a space marine compared to every other npc
[3:18:53] <Neoripo> Pat, there might be a LOT of salt underground
[3:18:55] <KittenHachiChan18> Are you telling me the Chocobo is the Duck That Carries You Across Short Distances?
[3:18:56] <+diazflak> The salt runs deep in this shithole country
[3:19:01] <Aeonknight_87> @nyterayce they're all good, some may be boring @ start but they expand as you level
[3:19:03] <Metballs> Yes
[3:19:03] <CrimsonSkeletons> If you were in an airship / Ifrit crash and you had to prepare a chocobo, what delicious spices would you use, chat?
[3:19:08] <mr_slaide> MURDER ALL THE LOCAL FLORA!
[3:19:08] <Renuarb> Wait was that Susano Barding on Pat's Bird?
[3:19:09] <DrakeSilvos> Oh yeah this bit.
[3:19:12] <%Remery_> Pure Salt
[3:19:17] <Forester_Skippy> oh man its like they knew about mosnter hunting
[3:19:19] <%RaikenTB> @CrimsonSkeletons Paprika.
[3:19:20] <Forester_Skippy> wait a minute
[3:19:23] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Oh no, is Pat going to have to fight a Loch Leech!? They're stronger than Ifrit.
[3:19:29] <%spacekataz18> Da bulldoooog
[3:19:31] <reiju_22> pat did you play through horizon? i can't get through it because I lost interest
[3:19:35] <+alphonseisbest> did someone say Monster Hunter?!
[3:19:38] <+rose_silver> Ala Mighans have been storing salt for two decades now ever since they got attacked by garleans, they've been salty ever since
[3:19:39] <KittenHachiChan18> Of course you named it Elmo.
[3:19:40] <KittenHachiChan18> XD
[3:19:42] <+EmoLlama> oh god this part
[3:19:43] <%MisterCrimson> I think Pat underestimates how much salt is worth compared to it's volume
[3:19:43] <+Mistheart101> Why's that bird look like Ganondorf
[3:19:44] <+alphonseisbest> jes suie monte
[3:19:45] <+JenovasPuppet> Why doesn't Elmo have cat barding?
[3:19:47] <Thalchampz> Birb Elmo
[3:19:49] <%CitrusDrink> beat up the sand gorblins
[3:19:55] <KittenHachiChan18> THAT LOOKS AWESOME
[3:19:57] <Forester_Skippy> OH THIS ONE this one is bad
[3:20:05] <%centrilion> I hated this
[3:20:07] <milequetoaster> oi mate the fokin YABBYS
[3:20:10] <Jonesman64> is this pokemon snap?
[3:20:11] <%CitrusDrink> punch it in the tummy
[3:20:12] <+JenovasPuppet> I want to say mouth.
[3:20:15] <KittenHachiChan18> Like a giant sand scorpion!
[3:20:17] <TheImmortal70> It's mouth
[3:20:20] <CrimsonSkeletons> Excellent, i agree, hopefully there is enough fat to make some gravy.
[3:20:26] <+Wrashis> its probably the dick
[3:20:26] <milequetoaster> for masive damage
[3:20:27] <ACriticalThink> It's not a shiny yabby
[3:20:28] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Look, Pat. Look with your special eyes.
[3:20:29] <Neoripo> yep, still ugly
[3:20:31] <%LeonDragonheart> shoot its fakin mouth
[3:20:32] <+nyterayce> was thinking either lancer or mar, but does either of them lead to dark night or samurai?
[3:20:34] <+pleroma00> mouf
[3:20:38] <inksmears> mouth
[3:20:45] <+KoyaMusa> Its the jawsa
[3:20:46] <fireking900> yeah it the butt
[3:20:50] <jacknerik> is this anor longdo
[3:20:50] <+arknodem> mouth
[3:20:50] <+Ilpala271> nothing leads to dark knight or samurai, you'll just get access to them later on
[3:20:54] <+arknodem> lower jaw area.
[3:20:55] <DrakeSilvos> It's got a weak butt.
[3:20:58] <SirDogBear> if its a salt monster its weakness might be to ignore it
[3:21:02] <Aeonknight_87> @nyterayce MRD leads to WAR, it's actually a tank. Lancer goes to DRG. DRK and SAM do not have pre-requisite classes
[3:21:02] <KittenHachiChan18> So it's a giant armored bug, horns are a danger zone, ligaments could be option to hit - or you could listen to the chat.
[3:21:03] <Jonesman64> its got a glass jaw?
[3:21:11] <%Remery_> It's cold?
[3:21:14] <KittenHachiChan18> Buggaboo
[3:21:18] <%MisterCrimson> I find hurling fire and lightning at it works too
[3:21:21] <+pleroma00> weak ass is nothing to joke about!
[3:21:22] <+DeadlyToastY> Yabby dont go to no dentists
[3:21:24] <Forester_Skippy> that jaw is more armored than its belly
[3:21:24] <Aeonknight_87> @nyterayce you just have to get to HW for DRK, and i think lvl 50 on any job for SAM
[3:21:24] <Pritswalk> Pat casts fist
[3:21:26] <+Kain5707> what was the point of this again?
[3:21:28] <Forester_Skippy> think baout it
[3:21:29] <ThatRandomGuy661> Pat no
[3:21:33] <inksmears> lmao pat
[3:21:36] <miguelrod777> NOO
[3:21:37] <Supabait> elaEZ
[3:21:39] <Jam643d> The point is to make your buddy suffer
[3:21:40] <DrRyder> It's fine
[3:21:42] <+trez_> LUL
[3:21:42] <Texeu> I knew he would do this xD

[3:21:46] <ae_moth> and he died
[3:21:47] <CrimsonSkeletons> What, monster hunter?
[3:21:48] <Metballs> They can't set up an industry with monsters everywhere so they need to learn to defend it
[3:21:49] <bielzitcho> pat you fucked up!
[3:21:52] <+pleroma00> the biggest fails

[3:22:20] <+Shillk> like a sack of lalafels

[3:22:23] <KittenHachiChan18> Pototos?
[3:22:23] <marylittle5657> pat you just killed... oh nevermind
[3:22:23] <+Ryuartyi_> Went down just as hard as when the Sultana died

[3:22:42] <+Mistheart101> A sack of what
[3:22:43] <%Fidel_Castbro> but you're hitting its face
[3:22:43] <bielzitcho> no fair, you had help from your chocobo!
[3:22:47] <%TheBroletariat> Its cheating when you are a Demigod Primal
[3:22:47] <%Fidel_Castbro> the thing you didn't tell him to do
[3:22:47] <%centrilion> After doing this quest and now seeing you can just ignore the weaknesses... im mad...
[3:22:51] <Jericu> You hit it in the jaw!
[3:22:55] <+rose_silver> elmo was the one that did all the damage

[3:23:08] <General_Terro> >not dead in 1 gcd wow big weak patron
[3:23:08] <Texeu> Pat... Not everyone is Warrior of Light THE KILLER OF GODS
[3:23:17] <Metballs> Yeah, being the warrior of light, blessed by a goddess helps

[3:23:40] <FunkyRot> heyo hello
[3:23:40] <Phantonbat> This music sounds a lot like the D4 theme

[3:24:16] <%titans_ace_jerid> YEAAAAAAAAAAH!
[3:24:17] <%TheBroletariat> At least Pat is consistent in his role playing
[3:24:18] <KittenHachiChan18> Oh, okay
[3:24:18] <%thepantsking> LOL
[3:24:20] <TioXyco> I wonder when that guy will die because of pat....
[3:24:23] <crimsonharvest> and nobody learned anything
[3:24:23] <+nyterayce> so starting with lance i can just switch to whatever or dio i have to go next class?
[3:24:23] <+EvilWillYT> thats damn hilarious
[3:24:23] <wired_soul> squadSheep TakeNRG
[3:24:24] <Renuarb> The best strategy. "Mechanics? Just hit it hard!"
[3:24:25] <Neoripo> @AngriestPat Are you a DRK or a WAR. that advice is very WAR
[3:24:28] <+JenovasPuppet> Warrior of Light is a tactical genius.
[3:24:28] <%ECRead> HIT IT TIL IT DIES
[3:24:29] <+DeadlyToastY> what even
[3:24:30] <Forester_Skippy> why are you all upset i said the same things i dotn see a problem ehre
[3:24:35] <Mastigias> Punch it harder! Get more oxygen!
[3:24:37] <KittenHachiChan18> And not a single fuck was given that day.
[3:24:39] <Jonesman64> JUS GIT GUUD DPS
[3:24:39] <KittenHachiChan18> XD
[3:24:41] <Thalchampz> well, you are a warrior of light, so that's not untrue
[3:24:46] <+Ingenk> “Yes, your pain sustains me”
[3:24:46] <fireking900> theres a baby salt monster
[3:24:49] <CatmanIX> if a potato's a popoto, is a tomato a totomo?
[3:24:50] <%CitrusDrink> How the hell do you have so many empty inventory slots?
[3:24:52] <+JenovasPuppet> "If you see an orange circle, just stand in it and do more DPS!"
[3:24:52] <+HanPaul> yo those be some FF8 monsters
[3:24:53] <$AzureGale> "great"
[3:24:56] <DrakeSilvos> The tallest mountain
[3:24:56] <@DreyfussFrost> I mean that's exactly the same advice I give in alliance raids and it always works out.
[3:24:59] <%mik255> living salt
[3:25:10] <%MisterCrimson> @nyterayce once you get to a certain point in MSQ you can switch classes by going to the guild for that clas
[3:25:21] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> you just need D E T E R M I N A T I O N
[3:25:27] <%Fenrirlives> Remember: Pat taught Clemps to dunk in DBFZ, so this must come naturally!
[3:25:31] <DrakeSilvos> Then everyone dies to meteors
[3:25:43] <%titans_ace_jerid> "What did the Warrior of Light teach you?""HIT IT BIG HARD"
[3:25:44] <+EvilWillYT> you just need R E S O L V E
[3:25:48] <@thenefftw> Just use your level 3 super raw
[3:26:11] <KnightAsteran> we saved the salt for Castle Superbeast
[3:26:16] <+Wrashis> im very confused about how my prime sub isnt ready, when im a constant prime subber.
[3:26:27] <milequetoaster> best cutscenes ahead
[3:26:34] <%MisterCrimson> you will, Pat, you will
[3:26:36] <KittenHachiChan18> I'm still stuck on how Chocobos can fly.
[3:26:41] <+KSabot> i just did the main scenario duty to test and the last ARR dungeon took an hour and 10 minutes
[3:26:47] <$Yakobro> @Wrashis once a month?
[3:26:50] <KnightAsteran> @kittenhachichan18 with great difficulty
[3:27:00] <%xemnahort> @KittenHachiChan18 could've sworn I explained that
[3:27:00] <fireking900> just do 2 corkscrew blows raw, they will never suspect it
[3:27:03] <+nyterayce> ah so your not locked, just have to go through with starter weapon until switching is an option
[3:27:03] <TioXyco> @KittenHachiChan18 special breeds can fly, not all of them
[3:27:08] <milequetoaster> That's kinda how post leveling quests are
[3:27:09] <Metballs> Nobody tell Kitten about the flying turtles
[3:27:12] <Sheveniner> @KittenHachiChan18 Lore answer: they're tuned to the Aetherial wind currents of the region, which helps them fly. Fun answer: they're big-strong birbs.
[3:27:13] <+EmoLlama> pat the npc
[3:27:14] <KnightAsteran> you really should be asking how a tortoise can fly
[3:27:21] <KittenHachiChan18> WAIT, THERE'S FLYING TURTLES?!
[3:27:21] <Jordan_z123> !uptime
[3:27:21] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 27m 30s.
[3:27:22] <+Wrashis> i believe so. i was subbed to pat so i should have still been subbed, but my sub for pat is gone and my prime sub is still on cooldown
[3:27:24] <%MisterCrimson> @KittenHachiChan18 the quest literally expalins it as willpower and determination
[3:27:27] <KnightAsteran> with jet legs apparently
[3:27:27] <+Wrashis> its a mystery
[3:27:34] <%spacekataz18> The flying turtles are the best
[3:27:36] <DrakeSilvos> No, how can a T-rex fly?
[3:27:36] <DiaDiaDiamond> down pat
[3:27:38] <mr_slaide> So... Are dps players still morons?
[3:27:39] <Aeonknight_87> @KittenHachiChan18 a lot of things fly. chocobo's, turtles, furniture, horses
[3:27:44] <KnightAsteran> man you should see a flying adamnatoise
[3:27:46] <%spacekataz18> Wind Attuned T-Rex can fly anywhere
[3:27:47] <Rngiddion> are they ever not?
[3:27:48] <%xemnahort> so what was the rafle anyway?
[3:27:49] <KnightAsteran> itll make you vomit
[3:27:51] <TheImmortal70> The jet propelled turtles are necessary
[3:27:55] <CatmanIX> if turtles couldn't fly how would the world exist?
[3:28:06] <KittenHachiChan18> THE FLYING TURTLES ARE REAL
[3:28:07] <maybeGabby> Is FF14 subscription rate still doing good? Feel like lots of people dropped out of playing it.
[3:28:10] <%bumbletroni> They go all the way down
[3:28:13] <KnightAsteran> dont forget the flying bears
[3:28:13] <%HiroTSK5> It's been maybe an hour, these people have no chill
[3:28:16] <KittenHachiChan18> OH MY GOD I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING MORE COOL THAN TAHT
[3:28:21] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> LAURENTIUS, KILL THAT BASTARD
[3:28:27] <KnightAsteran> flying lions too
[3:28:28] <+Kiyosuki> This character's japanese voice is amazing, it's super super deep
[3:28:29] <mr_slaide> I can't take Lalafells warriors seriously.
[3:28:35] <+rose_silver> @maybeGabby they pick up after a big update then decline, it's a cycle like that
[3:28:36] <KittenHachiChan18> Pipis looks like a chibi Sephiroth!
[3:28:40] <%SGrim> How dare they disrespect Berserk by naming a potato Pipin DansGame
[3:28:41] <+Absurd_Lizard> is that a joke character
[3:28:47] <%Fidel_Castbro> Hang those fuckers
[3:28:51] <Sheveniner> @maybeGabby That's pretty typical of most subscription MMOs. After people have done a patch's content, a lot of people unsubscribe until the next one.
[3:28:52] <KnightAsteran> all lala's are jokes
[3:28:53] <fireking900> MURDER
[3:28:53] <+Kiyosuki> English localization missed a huge opportunity not making his english voice super deep too imo
[3:28:54] <%Remery_> Death by SNOO SNOO
[3:28:55] <mr_slaide> KILL THEM ALL, PATRON!
[3:28:55] <+pleroma00> always murder
[3:28:56] <KnightAsteran> punt the fuckers
[3:28:59] <mr_hunter> BIG MURDER

[3:33:02] <@thenefftw> SNEK
[3:33:03] <%Remery_> SNEK
[3:33:08] <KittenHachiChan18> Just the concept of Plague being a Lalafel makes me smile somehow
[3:33:08] <+rose_silver> snek ladies
[3:33:08] <Glitterplague> Are the voices low? I can hear Pat and the game's music just fine, but the voices seem quiet.

[3:33:30] <KittenHachiChan18> Or, lamias?
[3:33:37] <+JenovasPuppet> LP tax will make it at least 2 tries.
[3:33:44] <%Fenrirlives> PRETTY SNEKS
[3:33:45] <KittenHachiChan18> Is there a difference between a naga and a lamia?
[3:33:45] <Iraq_Attack> labias?
[3:33:48] <Metballs> They're not exactly lamias, more naga
[3:33:59] <lennonbad> the tails seem to short
[3:34:00] <fireking900> type 1 if you would fuck a snek
[3:34:01] <+Wrashis> naga please
[3:34:08] <+trez_> monster musume has the answers you seek
[3:34:09] <Sorry4HavingFun> 1
[3:34:10] <KnightAsteran> Ananta is what theyre calles in game
[3:34:11] <%xemnahort> 1
[3:34:11] <@thenefftw> 1
[3:34:12] <damienlunas> 1
[3:34:13] <+Slaardacity> 1
[3:34:13] <%Remery_> 1
[3:34:14] <ForlornHunter> How are they standing with such little amount of tail actually on the ground?
[3:34:15] <KittenHachiChan18> @trez_ Thank you
[3:34:17] <Metballs> 111
[3:34:17] <Tuskor13> i assume a naga is that one enemy from chrono trigger and a lamia is the kind that weebs wanna smash
[3:34:18] <PopdropGardner> 1
[3:34:19] <AJusticeLemon> 1
[3:34:19] <Mastigias> 1
[3:34:19] <Mictlan93> 1
[3:34:20] <LeBlanc233> Whatever they are they're pretty bad
[3:34:20] <ScrapSentinel> 111111111
[3:34:20] <@CreepyPorpoise> magic
[3:34:22] <Sheveniner> They ananta. Lamia in this game are effectively chimerical constructs based off them.
[3:34:29] <Glass_Front> the tails have to be short, because the engine couldn't handle them turning without it looking like shit
[3:34:33] <+Ciphris> i want to hang out with raubahn
[3:34:34] <fireking900> i love you guys LUL
[3:34:34] <%xemnahort> 1 again cause I'd do it twice
[3:34:39] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> They 100% can't go back. That is well established
[3:34:39] <+Wrashis> if matt was here hed want to fuck a reverse snek
[3:34:40] <CatmanIX> @ForlornHunter sneks got crazy tail strength yo
[3:34:41] <+JenovasPuppet> 1 for XI lamias. Ananta are ugly.
[3:34:42] <Forester_Skippy> oh yeah laksmis shit doesnt wear off when she dies
[3:34:54] <%LeonDragonheart> God Ixion in this game is so ugly.
[3:34:58] <KittenHachiChan18> There actually IS a reverse snake girl in Centaur's Life
[3:34:59] <Mastigias> Once you go snake, everything else feels fake.
[3:35:02] <KittenHachiChan18> AND SHE'S CUTE
[3:35:03] <$Jazzarms> it'll be fiiiiiiiine
[3:35:04] <Tuskor13> nah man go for not reverse snake lady
[3:35:07] <+Kiyosuki> goddamn Lakshmi still wont give me a doggo :(
[3:35:07] <PopdropGardner> You know I completely forgot that the Echo was thing people could be born with, and not just a player mechanic
[3:35:07] <Renuarb> None of the Primal's influence does. That was kind of a big thing for Shiva's gang in HW
[3:35:08] <%RaikenTB> Thunderhorse!
[3:35:10] <%Fenrirlives> So what was the problem with the Snek Primal?
[3:35:10] <mr_slaide> Everything involving Lalafells goes to shit.
[3:35:12] <%MisterCrimson> @Sheveniner in Fractal Hard, it turs out the Allagans bio engineered most, if not all of the beast tribes
[3:35:13] <KnightAsteran> literally every time wr uave encountered enthralled its been drilled into our heads that they cant be cured, why woupd wr trust them now
[3:35:24] <KittenHachiChan18> No, this is a reverse snake that WORKS and is ADORABLE. She's called an Anartican
[3:35:34] <mr_slaide> Best girl!
[3:35:35] <KnightAsteran> @fenrirlives she was a psycho bitch
[3:35:42] <Sheveniner> @MisterCrimson Yup. There's also small hints that they may be responsible for some Spoken, as well.
[3:35:45] <+JenovasPuppet> Thancred please stop being emo soon.
[3:35:46] <KnightAsteran> Thancred best boi
[3:35:47] <Renuarb> HANDSOME STRANGER
[3:35:52] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Every primal is bad, they suck the life out of the land just by existing. So even a totally benign one causes huge damage just by existing.
[3:36:00] <KittenHachiChan18> WOW
[3:36:03] <mr_slaide> Oh man! Y'shtola is gonna put up a barrier or something!
[3:36:04] <CatmanIX> @KittenHachiChan18 oh yeah, she's fucking great, what series was that again?

[3:36:37] <+Kiyosuki> She's a cool character too but it probably plays a decent role in it
[3:36:37] <%Fenrirlives> Is Ysh still blind as fuck?
[3:36:40] <TheImmortal70> yshtola is popular because she's a good character
[3:36:43] <mr_slaide> Snek

[3:53:17] <TheImmortal70> Fordola's echo is weird and unusual
[3:53:17] <Forester_Skippy> I CANT STAND THESE RPers IN MY FAMR PARTIES WHO DISBANED AFTER 1 RUN
[3:53:18] <@DreyfussFrost> There were crystals hidden in the water.
[3:53:18] <Metballs> Do what?
[3:53:18] <+JenovasPuppet> @mik255 The three with the Echo count double
[3:53:18] <%Fidel_Castbro> because they snuck crystals in before the meeting
[3:53:20] <Fynale> @AngriestPat they said they already had ppl on the inside they put crystals in the water
[3:53:21] <AJusticeLemon> for a moment i thought he smiled
[3:53:25] <mr_hunter> no pupper?
[3:53:28] <inksmears> THANK THE TWELVE FOR ARENVALD
[3:53:28] <Metballs> They hit her really hard
[3:53:30] <+Kravedarknesss> @puddingpants88 I don't think so.
[3:53:31] <Pritswalk> what the hell was that creepy pervert smile
[3:53:37] <%mik255> flashback to 5 mins ago
[3:53:37] <Rngiddion> that fuck face when you echoed
[3:53:38] <milequetoaster> how would we ever have known
[3:53:40] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> !uptime
[3:53:40] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 53m 49s.
[3:53:40] <CatmanIX> that face though
[3:53:42] <Foymic> slide
[3:53:43] <KnightAsteran> that was a grimace guys
[3:53:48] <+rose_silver> @Pritswalk you mean pat's attempt at bieng happy?
[3:53:49] <+Ciphris> so what was pats reaction to fordolla telling pat he's seen some shit
[3:53:49] <DeepGrave> @AngriestPat How many level 70s do you have?
[3:53:59] <ZuthusPuffs> wow is the only mmo i've played pretty much, how is the raiding in this compared to wow?
[3:54:00] <youngin3005> what is youre stream overlay background ?
[3:54:06] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> LUL
[3:54:07] <Aeonknight_87> @DeepGrave he has PLD and DRK, that's it i think. all crafters/gatherers though
[3:54:31] <+Absurd_Lizard> 😡
[3:54:32] <@thenefftw> Still not redeemed
[3:54:35] <DeepGrave> @Aeonknight_87 He has level 70 for all crafters and gatherers?! fucking hell
[3:54:40] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Pat's also got RDM at 70
[3:54:40] <KnightAsteran> SHES STILL A PSYCHO MURDER BITCH
[3:54:43] <%Remery_> Could have stabbed her
[3:54:51] <poodo89> but she helped :O
[3:54:56] <@DreyfussFrost> @ZuthusPuffs Lower budget, but just as well designed, and way more story involved. No trash and fewer bosses, but the bosses are great and they get just as hard as the hardest mythics.
[3:55:02] <+Wrashis> i was just thinking he could stab her easily
[3:55:04] <KnightAsteran> but she murdered thousands of innocents
[3:55:05] <DeepGrave> Now back in your cage Fordola
[3:55:05] <$Jazzarms> it's never too late. you could still stab her
[3:55:10] <%Laecerelius> Is she gonna become FF14's Vegeta?
[3:55:15] <+Ciphris> still a murderer tho
[3:55:18] <Aeonknight_87> @DeepGrave he does have RDM as well
[3:55:20] <+HelloImTom08> how is Fordola cooler than Lyse LUL
[3:55:20] <zamzoph> D:
[3:55:22] <+JenovasPuppet> But now that she's seen your memories and knows that it's possible to not be a little bitch about everything, she's good!
[3:55:24] <inksmears> FF14's vegeta is nero
[3:55:29] <Pritswalk> *gasp a murderer*
[3:55:29] <@DreyfussFrost> @ZuthusPuffs When Ultimate Bahamut came out it took an entire week for the top raiders to clear just that one boss.
[3:55:31] <%Remery_> Scared ratty
[3:55:31] <IminyourBase> WHY IS THAT SNAKE WOMAN ALLOWED TO JUST WALK AROUND?!?!
[3:55:31] <+trez_> basically anyone is cooler than lyse FeelsBadMan
[3:55:37] <KnightAsteran> @laecerelius i fuckin hope not, she doesnt deserve it, Nero is the Vegeta
[3:55:38] <+Kravedarknesss> that lady in the background is so goddamn pale jesus
[3:55:42] <Metballs> Not all sneks are terrorists
[3:55:42] <+Absurd_Lizard> what are you waiting for!? KILL HER D:
[3:55:43] <damienlunas> her nickname is THE BUTCHER.
[3:55:43] <DeepGrave> I hate Lyse as well
[3:55:43] <Aeonknight_87> @IminyourBase she was on your team. in the resistance
[3:55:46] <+Slaardacity> ARREST ALL BEASTKIND
[3:55:48] <+rose_silver> @IminyourBase thats a different tribe snake, don't be racist now
[3:55:49] <$AzureGale> JoJo pose!
[3:55:49] <Pritswalk> woah dont discriminate against snek lady
[3:55:49] <poodo89> man look at all that murder
[3:55:49] <Metballs> You racist!
[3:55:51] <%MisterCrimson> @IminyourBase the purple ones are nice
[3:55:56] <fireking900> SHES A GOOD SNEK LEAVE HER ALONE
[3:55:57] <rangercrono> @iminyourbase different tribe that reject the summoning of primal
[3:56:00] <Tuskor13> drop the mic
[3:56:01] <+HelloImTom08> DROP THE MIC
[3:56:01] <+Kiyosuki> Nero's more of a Char
[3:56:02] <+Ciphris> need a borrowed power to feel empathy smh
[3:56:04] <+Absurd_Lizard> mic drop PogChamp
[3:56:04] <ZuthusPuffs> @DreyfussFrost cool thanks!
[3:56:07] <+Kiyosuki> with those sunglasses Kappa
[3:56:21] <DeepGrave> That's a good Fordola, you understand your place
[3:56:31] <+Kiyosuki> oh yeah Nero does like red too
[3:56:32] <IminyourBase> you saved our lives but like yeah you aren't like forgiven or anything
[3:56:33] <+Absurd_Lizard> fearrr is howwww i falllll
[3:56:35] <KittenHachiChan18> WOW
[3:56:35] <Ryo_no_Kage> What happens to a psychopath if you give them super empathy?
[3:56:36] <+furiousfurioso> back to the cell you go
[3:56:44] <Metballs> That's afir
[3:56:47] <ForlornHunter> I'm surprised that someone with a firearm and a grudge doesn't shoot her.
[3:56:50] <DeepGrave> No one cares what an ala mhigan thinks
[3:56:56] <damienlunas> I feel like that's fair
[3:56:58] <Tuskor13> That's a reasonable way to handle that.
[3:56:58] <+trainflip> those shoes are real dumb
[3:57:02] <Pritswalk> I like that theres this big dramatic scene while the snek lady just sorta gyrates in the background
[3:57:06] <+rose_silver> big cry
[3:57:08] <mr_slaide> Send her with those inept guards!
[3:57:08] <+rose_silver> big tear
[3:57:12] <%SSaryn> As redemption arcs go, this is still one of the better ones.
[3:57:12] <+Slaardacity> Thsts super fair
[3:57:13] <IminyourBase> ha big dumb stupid hero/murderer made a cry
[3:57:14] <DiaDiaDiamond> anime!
[3:57:14] <+HannibalBeerus> big dumb
[3:57:16] <+Absurd_Lizard> so edgy
[3:57:23] <Garrison27> Stupid ass anime tear
[3:57:27] <Renuarb> Thancred always fucking late
[3:57:27] <zamzoph> SeemsGood
[3:57:29] <@thenefftw> Just really fine
[3:57:30] <mr_slaide> Everything just worked out Patron!
[3:57:34] <+furiousfurioso> I was super afraid they would just let her go
[3:57:39] <DrakeSilvos> That other track should have kept going.
[3:57:39] <+SailingSaturn> The Executioner will do his job with his Pinky out in honor of that
[3:57:39] <Tuskor13> So what about the meeting they were having
[3:57:42] <%RaikenTB> Dat dog statue
[3:57:43] <Pritswalk> now off to the salt mines with all of you.
[3:57:44] <Baconrath> i havent played this in forev
[3:57:49] <+Wrashis> hey pat apparently scott steiner is wrestling again in tna/impact and hes a tag team champion.
[3:57:53] <+Absurd_Lizard> such a good character, reminds me of the great character "Shadow The Hedgehog"
[3:57:55] <%SSaryn> WHAT
[3:57:56] <IminyourBase> where'd they smuggle them in?
[3:57:56] <DeepGrave> Radobahn stop covering for Lyse
[3:57:58] <Baconrath> rip Tony Stanza the bard ;_;)7
[3:58:01] <DeepGrave> Let her drown
[3:58:03] <%spacekataz18> They put them in the water
[3:58:04] <Mariakko> Hid them in thier snake butts
[3:58:07] <mr_slaide> BIG MURDER
[3:58:14] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Bunch of the guards were already tempered
[3:58:17] <IminyourBase> snakes don't have butts just a cloaca
[3:58:18] <$Jazzarms> that could have gone better
[3:58:18] <zamzoph> an inquisition can take care of this 🤔
[3:58:18] <DeepGrave> @AngriestPat I like your policy as a dictator
[3:58:20] <Aeonknight_87> some of the guards were already Tempered, so they had them smuggle them
[3:58:21] <Metballs> It's fucked up that that's the only way
[3:58:22] <+SailingSaturn> Raubahn is a giant walking crystal cirBaka
[3:58:25] <PlumpPotatoRump> Hello people. Share this potato 🥔
[3:58:35] <Jericu> surely they could like...put some research into curing them?
[3:58:35] <%mik255> isnt that always the solution
[3:58:43] <TheImmortal70> I mean it's fucking magic brainwashing. The story sure as hell hasn't given a nother solution
[3:58:49] <+SailingSaturn> except that one Kobold
[3:58:49] <mr_slaide> Snek
[3:58:53] <DrakeSilvos> With the Ananta we tried to reason with the tempered ones.
[3:58:53] <@thenefftw> Snek
[3:58:54] <+JenovasPuppet> How did the guards get tempered before the primal was summoned?
[3:58:56] <CatmanIX> i mean, if you really can't cure 'em, what else ya gonna do?
[3:58:56] <%SSaryn> I would worship a giant Snek goddess.
[3:58:56] <Silly_Duckling> naw, you can cure zombies, right?
[3:58:57] <KnightAsteran> yeah, tempering is fucked uo
[3:59:00] <DeepGrave> Lyse just needs to be taught that people need to die
[3:59:01] <Baconrath> i cant remember where i stopped but it was before stormblood
[3:59:02] <Renuarb> This big romantic scene between Raubahn and Patron
[3:59:03] <milequetoaster> big nappie
[3:59:04] <mr_slaide> So romantic.
[3:59:05] <Belutima> They are basicilly magical zombies,
[3:59:10] <%xemnahort> what if they also have primal sympathizers who aren't thralled
[3:59:10] <Metballs> Jericu, theoretically they might be able to be saved if it's just overwritten with another tempering
[3:59:10] <+Absurd_Lizard> KappaPride
[3:59:17] <Metballs> But that's not really a help
[3:59:18] <%Remery_> Blush?
[3:59:19] <milequetoaster> I love this scene so much
[3:59:19] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> USA USA
[3:59:22] <Metballs> As they're still mindless saves
[3:59:22] <Sorry4HavingFun> the thing is that if they find a solution then it means everyone before couldve been cured
[3:59:26] <$Yakobro> I AM THE SENATE
[3:59:28] <Metballs> But for a benevolent god
[3:59:29] <Ser_Randal> USA USA USA

[4:14:23] <@thenefftw> That's not funny
[4:14:23] <%Remery_> OH GOD
[4:14:26] <+Absurd_Lizard> so evil....
[4:14:26] <lennonbad> odd
[4:14:26] <%CitrusDrink> lol @ my crippled dad
[4:14:27] <Forester_Skippy> HAHAHA HE LOST
[4:14:28] <rosemon5001> @Neoripo ohhhh i imagined that big fuck fucking a potato
[4:14:29] <+trez_> tarus are so awkward
[4:14:31] <%HiroTSK5> Is Raubahn just Dunban?
[4:14:36] <+Ilpala271> well
[4:14:37] <+quarkee> why is raubahns son so hot
[4:14:37] <GooseHudson> One armed guys are the scariest guys of them all
[4:14:39] <DrakeSilvos> We all trashin Raubahn.
[4:14:40] <+Ilpala271> it could be both
[4:14:40] <%mik255> raubahn is too big
[4:14:40] <Phantonbat> A giant fucked a potato
[4:14:41] <Jericu> Pipin was sold for a cup of beer, yeah?
[4:14:42] <%Remery_> Lalafells can get pregnant?
[4:14:45] <%Fidel_Castbro> Pippin is gonna lose his arm confirmed
[4:14:46] <%Meidolaon> I mean he probably fucked Nanamo, but
[4:14:47] <+Felto3> raubahn is multiple lalafells sewn together, pipin is his missing arm
[4:14:47] <%xemnahort> @IminyourBase probably but he adopted Pipin
[4:14:50] <+TheMojoLoL> Dear god what's wrong with his face
[4:14:50] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> Oh come on, you KNOW he's had a fling or two with the sultana
[4:14:52] <%CitrusDrink> just because he's adopted doesn't mean he HASN'T fucked a lala
[4:14:53] <+Kiyosuki> He gets that killer half cape though
[4:14:53] <$DavidCrimsonHeidern> But he super fucked a lala tho pat
[4:14:53] <Tuskor13> I just realized if those potatoes try to stab a normal guy with a knife made for the potatoes would it even do anything
[4:14:53] <Renuarb> I don't think Raubahn COULD fuck a Lalafell without breaking it
[4:14:54] <KittenHachiChan18> Like father like adopted son
[4:14:54] <Metballs> Pippin was sold into slavery to fight in the gladiatorial pits and Raubahn went "That's dumb. Don't do that."
[4:14:56] <KittenHachiChan18> OH MA
[4:14:57] <+Ciphris> i hope raubahn is into petite xaelas tho
[4:15:00] <+Yeajow> That doesnt mean he didnt though
[4:15:04] <Forester_Skippy> i just love how his son and best friend laugh at the fact he lost an arm

[4:27:54] <@DreyfussFrost> @Maximilian_DOOD Oh yeah, then there are all the post-HW patch quests, then Stormblood, then post-SB patch quests. It's a very long game, try not to get spoiled.
[4:27:59] <KittenHachiChan18> @AngriestPat I actually had a question about another game. I've been playing Persona 5 and I just beat Kaneshiro. Pathetic boss fight. What did you think about it, and after you beat him, did you keep Johanna in your party as well?
[4:28:00] <mojomoud> Sup PAt, Also have you played Divinity Original Sin 2?
[4:28:03] <mojomoud> It's reald good
[4:28:04] <%SSaryn> If no one saw, XI got a complete HD Overhaul mod.

[4:28:08] <+Ciphris> probably needs to be single player with the dwindling player base
[4:28:19] <%SSaryn> Oh yeah.
[4:28:20] <Jericu> THE ONE HUNDRED MISSIONS BETWEEN 2.X and 3.0
[4:28:22] <%MisterCrimson> 2.x wasmiserable
[4:28:25] <AJusticeLemon> jump potion
[4:28:26] <@DreyfussFrost> Max literally bought the story skip potion and skipped that whole section
[4:28:30] <Fynale> @AngriestPat he never did a realm reborn he jump potioned
[4:28:34] <miracleman6> max skipped arr
[4:28:35] <+trez_> max boguht a skip pot LUL
[4:28:37] <@Maximilian_DOOD> The greatest decision in my life was to pay for the ARR story skip @AngriestPat
[4:28:37] <+S14y3d> arr is actually awaful
[4:28:39] <%SSaryn> Realm Reborn is awful going through.
[4:28:44] <+Alec_The_Risktaker> SHHH
[4:28:44] <+koagz> ARR was such a trek
[4:28:48] <Forester_Skippy> the dragonsong war ending too
[4:28:52] <%SSaryn> "Noooooooo"
[4:28:56] <%SSaryn> Wat
[4:28:58] <+arknodem> Warrior of Darkness was legit.
[4:28:58] <crimsonharvest> i almost just shit my pants because i ate too much sorbitol
[4:29:02] <%AzureGale> Fucking scavenger hunts are the worst kind of scavenger hunts
[4:29:04] <+VanaSkiller> LUL
[4:29:05] <+Ciphris> i couldn't take the warriors of darkness seriously muhXD
[4:29:06] <$OmegaWeltall> Warriors of Darkness arch goes nowhere NotLikeThis
[4:29:10] <+terry_quest> 2.x-2.55 was hell
[4:29:11] <@DreyfussFrost> @Maximilian_DOOD Great decision not to play it yourself, but do you want a recap video for context?
[4:29:21] <%SSaryn> Nanamo is fiiiiiiine.
[4:29:27] <%SSaryn> apatWink apatWink apatWink
[4:29:30] <ErikQRoks> lol mostly skipped my message
[4:29:39] <KittenHachiChan18> What's sorbitol?
[4:29:40] <@Maximilian_DOOD> Really, the story just doesn't catch me in this game for no reason @DreyfussFrost I love playing with people and getting new gear
[4:29:47] <@Maximilian_DOOD> bosses keep me motivated to keep going in XIV
[4:29:47] <%AbnormalVoid> Petting peepee on stream? How scandalous apatSmug
[4:30:07] <ArgentUndaCova> Oh shit, Elmo winking is now an emote PogChamp
[4:30:12] <TofuNyan> @Maximilian_DOOD It's the same for me, Dark Souls has cool lore, but i play it cause the gameplay is good <> FFXIV
[4:30:17] <Metballs> It's around The Vault that HW picks up, so that's fair
[4:30:21] <+NYCrownlessKing> it's mostly getting to the dynamic story events of like who are the world shaking bosses, like biggest threat. or the fan service summons @Maximilian_DOOD
[4:30:22] <%SSaryn> @Maximilian_DOOD Any plans to possibly be doing any Savage content in the game due to bosses being your primary reason for playing?
[4:30:30] <Metballs> But yeah, I keep playing for teh bosses
[4:30:35] <Metballs> Specifically the music
[4:30:38] <@DreyfussFrost> @Maximilian_DOOD Oh, well then I don't want to spoil but the game will keep getting better in that regard. I think you will especially like the 3.0 end boss.
[4:30:44] <Metballs> I feel I sub just for teh music sometimes
[4:30:47] <@Maximilian_DOOD> maybe eventually? @SSaryn I just wanna be caught up at some point
[4:30:55] <SchizoidFeller> Hot take: Dark Souls 3 has no lore
[4:31:11] <+Kiyosuki> GOWKratos
[4:31:13] <%SSaryn> Poison PO-TA-TOES
[4:31:20] <ThePuddingDead> lol
[4:31:21] <%VoxNoctemz> @dreyfussfrost Are you still the leader of your guild and is Pat still in it?
[4:31:21] <KittenHachiChan18> WOW
[4:31:26] <Aeonknight_87> @Maximilian_DOOD what server you on? can run you through some shit if you're on same data center
[4:31:37] <@DreyfussFrost> @Maximilian_DOOD Yeah for sure. Make finishing the MSQ your first priority. The game has a level sync function so you can go back and do those old bosses at the appropriate level later.
[4:31:42] <@DreyfussFrost> @VoxNoctemz No and no.
[4:31:42] <arkv01> plague of buttwipes!
[4:31:44] <%Remery_> Plague of Wipes

[4:32:18] <Forester_Skippy> 24hour maintances as always yeah
[4:32:19] <+NYCrownlessKing> think of where you are now, as like the beginning of ARR, ur already in 57 content so you're close to getting to all good stuff once you hit the story ending content at 60 @Maximilian_DOOD
[4:32:24] <ThePuddingDead> i literally missed the entire stream in 2 hours i was at work
[4:32:27] <+redstonej> dreams of potato
[4:32:35] <%SSaryn> Big big patch.
[4:32:36] <+NYCrownlessKing> after that its just bonus extra content on top of that like Alexander, etc @Maximilian_DOOD
[4:32:39] <KittenHachiChan18> I actually had a question. When it comes to Persona 5 and I'm in Mementos, is it better to have Johanna or Carmen?
