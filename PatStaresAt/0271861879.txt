[0:23:10] <Rongdisk23> Because it was supposed to be a surprise
[0:23:10] <jex771> its taking forever because its just Rage 2 and fallout 76
[0:23:10] <Nemesisnick33> its long cause theres nothing else to show FeelsBadMan
[0:23:11] <WarAtWorld17> I didn't like it

[0:23:14] <KoyaMusa> DON'T CARE
[0:23:14] <+Bricked> at least it seems to get its tone better than Suicide Squad I think
[0:23:14] <alcors_wisdom> 20 minutes for one game
[0:23:14] <7o8145> it's because they only have like 2 games
[0:23:15] <dusk1230> they have nothing do they are stalling
[0:23:15] <NemokillerV> eh
[0:23:15] <JumbleJams> THATS NOT EVEN THE SONG HE SANG

[0:23:16] <%TheBlackMandalorian> This game looks kinda boring honeslty looks like nothing new
[0:23:16] <+nepwar> it feels like the trailer is trying to make it zany and the game is not going to actually be that

[0:31:03] <Cranky_Construct> Isn't that why Morrowind was s good? It was super weird and unconventional
[0:31:03] <grouchio> Like it's made by Bethesda
[0:31:03] <IHaveNoFunnyName> Tamriel was made generic by more games
[0:31:03] <dakuman13> elder scrolls is so boring to look at
[0:31:04] <Multicolouredmirrors> TAMRIEL IS GREAT

[0:31:05] <+kukadin> No they aren't, the games are buggy shitfests and the combat matches
[0:31:05] <PessimisticOptimism> I CLAPPED WHEN I SAW
[0:31:05] <TheDwarvenBard> Morrowind is pretty fucking far from generic
[0:31:06] <time_axis> that could not be more wrong, but thats how I feel about fallout
[0:31:06] <Bouldus> thats the noise most peopel made
[0:31:06] <+ajcritfumble> BIG TRUTH
[0:31:06] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> PAT IS SUPER RIGHT
[0:31:06] <radical_skeleton> the setting is sick but the games don't show it

[0:31:13] <CreamCreamy> PAT IS SUPER RIGHT
[0:31:13] <+OdysseyKnight> Tamriel has a very interesting setting but with each iteration they made it more and more generic
[0:31:13] <Gruntini> Elder Scrolls is more interesting than LOTR, fight me

[0:31:14] <2pac_2furious_> Elder Scrolls games already play like a bad MMO
[0:31:14] <+Garrosh_Heckscream> LITERALLY ONLY THE CAPITAL AND SKYRIM ARE GENERIC
[0:31:15] <Bouldus> Pat correct
[0:31:15] <Strigiform> a glance at the setting is terrible, but underneath is all glorantha
[0:31:15] <+TransporterX7> He right tho

[0:31:28] <outis94> tamrial is fuckin werid the fuck you talking about
[0:31:28] <Keith_The_Triangle> PAT SHUT UP ES LORE IS THE BEST
[0:31:28] <matrixManipulator> CRAZY TALK JUST MADE THE GAMES BETTER RETROACTIVELY GUYS, LOOK AT THAT
[0:31:28] <$SGrim> It is generic fantasy guys. It's just really well executed and totally makes up for it.
[0:31:29] <Yung_FckUp> it is the exact opposite my man
[0:31:29] <%chiluzza> you can actually see a dwarf in TES3 Morrowind
[0:31:29] <SwagglesMD> ESO is before the Third Era
[0:31:29] <CreamCreamy> pat is right that on the surface, as in, in the games
[0:31:29] <Bouldus> pats correct get over it
[0:31:29] <%maskedriderhero> Why is my stream constantly lagging and buffering, fuck me
[0:31:30] <shincthulhu> PAT IS THE RIGHTEST

[0:31:30] <alcors_wisdom> what no hes super right skyrim's setting is generic as fuck
[0:31:30] <%KittenHachiChan18> [CRAZY TALK] ACTIVATES
[0:31:31] <CreamCreamy> it's very lame
[0:31:32] <+PipIV> WONDERBOY
[0:31:33] <Volkrotia> Fuckin DIABLO has a more interesting world than ES
[0:31:33] <Drummageddor> how long is this trailer ResidentSleeper
[0:31:33] <+RainShott> MMO? MM-NO. Co-op yes 👌
[0:31:34] <DaHaLoJeDi> I DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS BAD KNOCKOFF, GIVE ME THE REAL THING
[0:31:34] <PessimisticOptimism> THE law is great
[0:31:34] <%MaiHusbando9S> the setting is fine, bethesda just sucks at showing the interesting parts
[0:31:34] <%floridianman> Its cute they think they're a real mmo
[0:31:34] <TrotskyIsHotsky> FUCKBOIVEN STRIKES AGAIN
[0:31:35] <%forevern2dust> apatBig TRVE
[0:31:36] <%chiluzza> he was on another realm when they blapped out
[0:31:37] <+AliveAleks> Crazy Talk
[0:31:37] <skybriel1> the setting is pretty sick actually, it's just Cyrodil and Skyrim that are kinda same-y
[0:31:37] <Mnightshyamallama> that moment the wings clip through everything in your trailer
[0:31:37] <+genowyn> Tamriel is the least generic setting pat ffs
[0:31:38] <NemokillerV> nah they're dead
[0:31:38] <SwagglesMD> So they'd be there
[0:31:38] <chza> Tamriel as a world is second to none in all of gaming really. i just want better gameplay
[0:31:40] <408dude> JUST ANNOUNCE BR ALREADY
[0:31:41] <badvoltron> atpButtHash atpButtHash atpButtHash
[0:31:42] <wired_soul> omg dont say that ....
[0:31:42] <dietmouintainmadewka> PAT IS UNEDUCATED ON TES LORE
[0:31:43] <Shastafield> just wait a year
[0:31:43] <+AncelDeLambert> The dwarves better stay FUCKING DEAD
[0:31:44] <+SolidusRex> OMIKRON ONLINE
[0:31:44] <Futurecity10> Dwarves were wiped from existance
[0:31:45] <sayaman012341> Is this a metal version of three hearts as one?
[0:31:46] <texmex386> Excuse me? Tamriel is super unique. Oblivion and Skyrim did a shitshow of showing it.
[0:31:47] <ImmaCanuck> SMOrc KomodoHype BrokeBack
[0:31:47] <SmithersDotTV> i mean i just dislike elder scrolls
[0:31:48] <%KittenHachiChan18> YEP
[0:31:48] <angryhawk178> @angriestpat And the parts that are not generic you will never see.
[0:31:51] <dukenux> TES Lore is litteraly make shit up on the spot, because muh CHIM
[0:31:52] <PessimisticOptimism> Summerset it on fire
[0:31:52] <+SvenHolgersson> lukewarm as HELL
[0:31:52] <tUxUt> theres still 25 years left on skyrim's life cycle
[0:31:52] <Innocuous_Goat> They'll make a new one when Online dies
[0:31:53] <SmithersDotTV> I think it's really generic
[0:31:53] <DaHaLoJeDi> NO APPLAUSE
[0:31:53] <%KittenHachiChan18> SHUT UP BOIVIN
[0:31:54] <+Bupkis7> You shut up Pat!
[0:31:54] <Blackjackal95> From Soft has the best fantasy worlds imo
[0:31:55] <+PalmtopNami> one showed up in Morrowind
[0:31:56] <SubliminaIMessages> Elder Scrolls ain't getting a game because ESO makes Bethesda a crapload of money
[0:31:56] <+genowyn> Pat you know nothing of CHIM
[0:31:57] <$PonyHearts> 76 MAKES SWEAT BULLETS IN TERROR.
[0:31:57] <+hadokendude1> Right if it isn't on the screen then it's legit generic
[0:31:57] <+213372bu> The lighting and textures make it look a lot less washed out though
[0:31:59] <Parapattern> Pat learn that the Argonians are trees that invaded Hell and won
[0:32:00] <NitsKriks> he hasnt even seen shit yet
[0:32:00] <+TheAmazingNick> Its Fallout 4 New Vegas
[0:32:01] <deviljhojho94> YOU THINK NOTHING
[0:32:01] <%WackyGear> I hope they announce es 6, but we all know it's not going to happen
