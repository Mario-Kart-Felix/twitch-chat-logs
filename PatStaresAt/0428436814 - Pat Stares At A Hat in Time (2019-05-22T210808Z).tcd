[0:03:28] <%SWFanatic> This is not embellished at all I'm sure
[0:03:29] <dukenux> Fahrenheit was dumb. He took his own body temp as a control point... when he was sick.

[0:04:36] <OkamiDude15> thats pretty cold
[0:04:39] <VritraReiRei> @Them00n you missed the part where you have to multiply by 1.8 before adding 32 to go from C to F
[0:04:39] <+BorinCorran> Celcius actually makes logical sense. Farenheight is for idiots like all imperial measurements. Fight me.
[0:04:40] <%TheWinged7> LUL sipsipSipsipblind

Now you didn't put the crack pipenin my mouth, but you did fill it to the brim in front of someone with poor impulse control. I don't regret it tho, watching chat blow up at you on finishing Minecraft.

[0:16:01] <+Gespens> @LeoStrahl DQ has always kepet the same core mchanics, and in a genre that keeps on introducing new mechanics to be fresh, its nice to see a familiar design. It's just there was nothing to do in the massive length

[0:16:03] <+Zxtole> If the bots are even mediocre they'll be better than my average party

[0:18:04] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 I've gotten weird versions of "grass is greener" burnout. When we were growing up, going back and forth between mom and dad, my brothers bought a second xbox, so we'd have 1 at each house. This lead to us having our saves and games split between the two. This lead to me sitting there listlessly wishing I could play a game that was at the other house, no matter which house I was at. The sitting around trying to figure out what to watch on Netflix is a microcosm of this i guess.

[0:24:21] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> even the Ohio bagel :(
[0:24:21] <%happyface699> No wonder I hate bagels
[0:24:22] <%ElenaManetta> Most places don't make their own bagels. They all come from the same place

[0:25:47] <+shin_porky_pig> they got that liquid shit
[0:25:48] <@JustinianKnight> it's the same with NY pizza
[0:25:49] <HorribleHog> Don't drink the tap water monkaS
[0:25:49] <+phtevenfry> *shrug* I've enjoyed bagels here in Indiana.
[0:25:50] <%ElenaManetta> YOU CAN'T TRUST THE TaP WATER
[0:25:50] <%joylent_blue> that sounds like bullshit, but i believe it
[0:25:51] <+Shaggnar> It's also mostly in your head

[0:26:01] <+Mr_Lawful> monkaS the gay frogs were the warning
[0:26:02] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Does it turn the frogs gay?
[0:26:02] <MasterDecoder> @ElenaManetta Baking them would kill anything bad though
[0:26:03] <BunnyEmperor> so you're saying NY bagels are made with sewage
[0:26:04] <%AncelDeLambert> hard water sucks for a lot of food
[0:26:06] <+oOZtkOo> the tappiest tap water
[0:26:06] <BappoSama> After moving to NY 2 years ago, i can absolutely say that the tap water here is waaay better than AZ tap water. @AngriestPat
[0:26:06] <ValidVenasaur> It's called sewage @angriestpat
[0:26:07] <%ArchimerDreatect> pump the tapwater with tasty drugs, got it.
[0:26:08] <%nmaten> nyc has godlike tap water yall have no clue what youre talking about
[0:26:08] <Finchit> Please tell me you started 30 mins ago @AngriestPat
[0:26:12] <MrPwng3> thats why he died
[0:26:12] <%SirGO0SE> people buy the tap and ship it tristate @AngriestPat
[0:26:14] <%happyface699> My gay frogs
[0:26:17] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 The reason we have such good bagels and pizza is the way our water and how it interacts with the dough. You can buy backs of the minerals involved and hook them up to your pipes to improve the taste. We sometimes ship a few gallons of NY water to a friend in Pennsylvania so he can make the good shit.
[0:26:19] <AHandito> NY pizza is trash
[0:26:20] <%patman22897> Saint louis has some solid tap water
[0:26:20] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat because its fucking CLEANER pat! its cleaner water

[0:27:09] <%ElenaManetta> So fancy, you have to pay to see it
[0:27:13] <BobaFetish2124> Also, in NY we don't cut our bagels wrong like some places
[0:27:15] <+StrawberryPantsu> [Redacted] Talked about that once
[0:27:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer500 Why is everyone dissing the St. Louis style bread-cut bagels? It's the best way to apportion it out for your whole office/team at work without buying 10 whole bagels. And you maximize the cream cheese to bagel ratio.

[0:42:42] <+JavaManJoJo> There's different flavored tho, yeah?
[0:42:43] <theguy4445> i associate the smell of incense with vape shops so i avoid them
[0:42:45] <%FrustratedAF> potpourri?
[0:42:46] <GG_Julio> dont you use unscented deodorant
[0:42:46] <Iggeh0> @Shaggnar you wrote Beagles, not bagels, its a joke
[0:42:47] <thelonechris> So a Macy's would be a deathtrap
[0:42:50] <%connos_livereview> Incense can alo fuck with your eyes if you are just a normal person
[0:42:50] <@lewdskeletor13> I hate incest too
[0:42:50] <%Typhaeon> Sage?

[0:43:02] <dukenux> Incest causes me pain too
[0:43:03] <+Taglog7> Incests?!
[0:43:03] <pshuuu> cause its synthetic chemical garbage
[0:43:05] <%Laecerelius> Pat hates burning incest
[0:43:09] <%connos_livereview> like it can give you blepharitis
[0:43:10] <+TripleBizzle> burning potpourri MaxLOL
[0:43:11] <$cureneckbeard> So that's how Pat became an indoors cat
[0:43:13] <D3rrtyD4n> dat patchouli stink
[0:43:13] <%daveglhf> Mustard isn't incense
[0:43:16] <%Verd_254> detox the goblins apatGoblin
[0:43:16] <MarylandJutsu> INCENSE DESTROYS mind Gobalins
[0:43:17] <%nano_vg> its like a dick human exploded a axe can in the buss and i guess il die
[0:43:21] <OkamiDude15> pat walk into a macy's and just dies
[0:43:25] <%Shikari21> incense smeels great
[0:43:27] <+uncledickbutt> incense wards off the beasts KappaCool
[0:43:27] <dukenux> You aren't supposed to eat the potpourri?

[0:43:36] <Them00n> @AngriestPat Play the GAME FOR FUCKS SAKE.
[0:43:37] <%jessedouglas> pat + macy's = death
[0:43:38] <+Spec7re> Mind goblins try to escape when they smell perfume
[0:43:38] <+Shaedris> Worst part is flying and being forced to walk through the perfume-filled Tax Free.
[0:43:39] <+TastySammiches> pat's head ASPLODE
[0:43:39] <BobaFetish2124> I always thought u had to boil bagels to give it it's texture
[0:43:41] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat so is it the synthetic chemicals? or even natural smells too?
[0:43:41] <+LtShuckle> not the perfume department
[0:43:41] <theguy4445> that's a shitty thing to be allergic to
[0:43:42] <42nfl19> Just wear a gas mask and purify ALL THE AIR @AngriestPat
[0:43:46] <demegodz> It's that scene in Spongebob where they have to go through the perfume department
[0:43:46] <%Laecerelius> Pat needs to wear a gas mask around town
[0:43:47] <+SolverCODO> Pat is dating his sister and that's why he doesn't want to burn incest
[0:43:47] <SpaceGuntank> the perfume isle!
[0:43:48] <%WheatlyXT> burning incense in the man bun to keep it tight and smelling good
[0:43:49] <SovPho> Boiling bagels also gives them their texture and chewiness, but bagels are a byproduct of some sort of workaround for Jews getting bread in NYC a long ass time ago
[0:43:49] <dukenux> It's like that scene in Spongebob
[0:43:50] <+Taglog7> erica the worst gym leader

[1:00:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer500 The game doesn't know your family structure and neither do we! The average person probably has a maternal uncle, therefore, in general, uncle's sister is mom or aunt. Why you gotta overcomplicate things?

[1:10:34] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat Because the Security Question is usually Mother's Maiden Name. So they say "uncle's sister" to say Mother.
[1:10:36] <ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat What is that guy supposed to be?
[1:10:37] <%WheatlyXT> It couldn't possibly be that as the twist. That'd be impossible

[1:10:57] <%Nedlin> @AngriestPat It's because you started this by remarking it was funny that her maiden name was "Boivin". Chat assumed you were talking about your mom's side of the family, because there's nothing remarkable about a PATERNAL aunt having the same maiden name that you do.

[1:21:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @garbageNirvana it doesn't. Whole thing is a lie.
[1:21:57] <OkamiDude15> time advances when you go through certain doors
[1:21:57] <crunkers_> you missed my heart
[1:22:00] <ooblag> I'm pretty sure it advances just based on progression
[1:22:01] <%Solidus_113> @GarbageNirvana after entering key rooms or grabbing certain items
[1:22:05] <%Dovahthing> you can use ice power to stay in ice sculpture and remain undetected
[1:22:08] <+RealmRifter> Gonna catch the previous Hat vod too. Have a good time y'all

[1:22:10] <+Venhammer> @garbagenirvana It only passes when you go into certain rooms, there’s no actual timer
[1:22:16] <+oOZtkOo> i believe time advances by entering certain rooms
[1:22:17] <Liquid_Dio> @garbagenirvana when you enter certain rooms for the first time it shows the progression of time

[2:18:22] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat and then their hearts bleed, for they had failed you. woopsCry
[2:18:23] <veldinmusic> you fought a child over santa
[2:18:24] <rufus2k2> not the 1st or last fight he had in his life
[2:18:26] <reonome> RYAN WAS RIGHT
[2:18:26] <%Edgy_Macaroon> did you win
[2:18:26] <ToneBacas> all for revenge
[2:18:26] <%Frost_Quill> How do you remember this kid's name? I don't even remember the name of the guy who punched me in the FACE in HIGHSCHOOL. What the fuck Pat.
[2:18:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> oh this just gets better and better
[2:18:27] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Who won the fight? ;D
[2:18:27] <aimlesshealer> I bet Ryan was like "TOLD YOU"
[2:18:28] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat did you apologize
[2:18:30] <+hdawger> Santa Clause really isn't real though (BTW)
[2:18:30] <%ElenaManetta> little baby patrick was asking tough philosophical questions to his parents
[2:18:30] <%Niney_Who> You fought him for an idea
[2:18:31] <@lewdskeletor13> No Dante, we are not having wahoo times, we are fighting do our families honor!
[2:18:33] <TwinBat> that's so fucking wholesome tho
[2:18:33] <%Shadowthedigger> You were young enough, why not just continue the lie?
[2:18:34] <RoboXGP> this happened last year
[2:18:35] <dsauce999> These Parents have no honor
[2:18:35] <KuroKartoonist> Pat mom and dad: yes pat we truly are the lairers
[2:18:36] <%gespenst25> eh Ryan was a bitch
[2:18:36] <%arancet> then you had to fight your parents
[2:18:36] <rufus2k2> I admire that chihuahua fight energy
[2:18:37] <fallenangelzelos> Is this the Santa story? Haha
[2:18:38] <MrPwng3> for honor
[2:18:41] <BourneWarrior> WHAT AM I FIGHTING FOR
[2:18:42] <+DrunkenDice> Pat you fought for the honor of your folks. Nothing wrong with that
[2:18:48] <mayorrev> RYAN HAS NO HONOR
[2:18:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> What? Punching Ryan isn't reward enough
[2:18:51] <CalderGaming> that nonexistent honor
[2:18:51] <reonome> too bad they had no honor
[2:18:53] <%PROUD2beGINGER> YOU LIE
[2:18:54] <%HentaiSenpai9K> Pat the Canadian Samurai
[2:18:54] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You were fighting for JUSTICE
[2:18:54] <TyrantBelial> THIS RYAN HAS NO HONOR
[2:18:56] <OkamiDude15> when two people fight over the very reason of their existence theyMUST FIGHT
[2:18:56] <+SolverCODO> the honor they didn't have
[2:18:56] <+Randomuser50> it wasnt for nothing you talked with fists a bond that cant be broken
[2:18:56] <jorgeniev> why are we here ? just to suffer?
[2:18:57] <MrPwng3> no dignity
[2:18:58] <a_mad_dragon> BUT THEY HAD NONE
[2:18:59] <@lewdskeletor13> Did you go to school with Ryan Reynolds?
[2:19:00] <FirearmsInstructor> @dsauce999 ok I choked on my water at that one, good job ;D
[2:19:01] <+Reizie_Etherealm> But the fact that you stood up for your parents, is something you can be proud of. No matter if the reasoning is dog shit
[2:19:02] <aimlesshealer> And from that day forth, Pat abandoned the concept of honor
[2:19:03] <Storm_Samurai> They played me like a damn fiddle!
[2:19:04] <%snow_bush> And that's when pat learned honor is meaningess
[2:19:05] <dero45> Honor thy parents with violence
[2:19:11] <%CrimsonCore90> when in fact they were scumbags all along.
[2:19:16] <+Cryghoul> Pat have you seen the new awful spiderman poster
[2:19:17] <rufus2k2> I love that that story is less "santa claus is real" and more "don't talk shit about my ma and pa!"
[2:19:18] <veldinmusic> You know, there is probably worse things to fight about when you're a kid
[2:19:20] <dsauce999> @FirearmsInstructor thanks
[2:19:27] <%CrimsonCore90> Truly we all are the hat in time
[2:19:27] <%cTAKU> Actually Santa is real but he only visits the NICE & NAUGHTY kids so parents tell their JUST OK kids he will visit so theydon't feel left out
[2:19:27] <mesamus> pat you need to share you tragic story with geoff when you meet him cause he was revealed ALL the lies at the same time
[2:19:30] <Savages4Blood> @angriestpat the next sekiro game will be about you defending the honor of your parents. the main antagonist? RYAN
[2:19:31] <%Edgy_Macaroon> d is you win tho
[2:19:35] <%Niney_Who> Because you weren't supposed to do that
[2:19:36] <Zarkith> Because it's not the intended way revLul
[2:19:37] <%HentaiSenpai9K> @cryghoul eh? what's that about?
[2:19:38] <%skizzuto> I don't think that was the intended route
[2:19:38] <Megapikman132> that's not the intended path
[2:19:40] <FirearmsInstructor> @dsauce999 Lt.Worf / 10
[2:19:41] <Megapikman132> Good job tho
[2:19:42] <aimlesshealer> Camera wants some of them leaks
[2:19:42] <Darthkitten_Prime> I mean, I don't think you were meant to do that that way
[2:19:43] <artoflec> yeah teh camera can be rough in some ways
[2:19:44] <redlight55> u used top down cam
[2:19:45] <Lapinelis> look up
[2:19:52] <+LeoStrahl> Then Pat learned that trust and honour is ONLY for Redbull, the only thing that has never lied or betrayed him!
[2:19:54] <MrDonTacos_> speedrun strats PogChamp
[2:19:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> Is Pat Kid a Jojo ?

[2:21:02] <reonome> FUCK THE POOR
[2:21:04] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I believed in Santa until 5th grade where we *RESPONDED* to "Letters to Santa" from 1st and 2nd graders, AS SANTA... Talk about a rude awakening / shock. I got SUPER made fun of ;(
[2:21:04] <Ion_Laser> uh oh
[2:21:05] <%CJett92> Just tell him to stop being poor
[2:21:05] <dsauce999> Wowee
[2:21:07] <%brave_sj> That's hilarious and I never came to that conclusion but okay
[2:21:07] <Captain_Joe1911> :D
[2:21:08] <MrPwng3> capitalist santa will not stand for your slander
[2:21:09] <MrDonTacos_> D:
[2:21:10] <%Taisuru> I didn't reach that conclusion but that's cause I was the poor kid
[2:21:12] <ne0bunny> wait no, thats not what its supposed to mean at all
[2:21:13] <+karawra> never thought about that before
[2:21:13] <+LeoStrahl> I mean, I think that's more of a Pat thing, but I see your logic
[2:21:13] <$cureneckbeard> I believed in Santa until I was like 11 because we were poor and I didn't believe my parents could afford to pay for the presents I got
[2:21:13] <derekwst3> @XxBTExX how dare you
[2:21:14] <+EdgyOnPorpoise> As the poor one, you are correct that many people had that assumption
[2:21:15] <%ElenaManetta> yeah like that rich boivin family down the street are assholes
[2:21:15] <T_Sasquatch> i mean thats a massive stretch to think about LUL
[2:21:17] <%ElenaManetta> their son is a monster
[2:21:17] <a_c_chirns> Destroy the means of production
[2:21:18] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Piemen99) (warning)
[2:21:18] <Soliloquy123> Only label a COUPLE presents "From Santa" Make sure they know MOST are from you.
[2:21:19] <%FrustratedAF> what did derek do to deserve the call out D:
[2:21:19] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Theres a song called Santa hates poor kids by my favorite martiian
[2:21:20] <%ElenaManetta> he beats kids up for no reason
[2:21:20] <%happyface699> What did I walk back into
[2:21:20] <@lewdskeletor13> Santa is a capitalist
[2:21:21] <%tigerfang86> SAVED IT
[2:21:21] <smegma_sorcerer> just buy more money :)
[2:21:25] <sighman55> how about not use backwards logic
[2:21:28] <%Piemen99> Oh piss off @Moobot
[2:21:28] <%weissguard> Ironically, that's how Santa is in that one anime, Hayate the Combat Butler.
[2:21:28] <veldinmusic> For me santa only gave meh presents and my parents got me the cool shit
[2:21:30] <Ion_Laser> :D :D :D
[2:21:31] <%Frost_Quill> And all those starving kids in [NAME AN AFRICAN COUNTRY] must be bad people because Santa doesn't even VISIT them at ALL. /sarcasm

[2:24:23] <+mercado94> @AngriestPat if you get rich please build the RE mansion
[2:24:25] <depressedpepega> That's a weird way to litter but whtever
[2:24:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> and we all know pat can't drive let alone not go one stream with his balls getting blased
[2:24:27] <FirearmsInstructor> ... dennis leary throwing burgers out of the window of a car? what?

[2:24:32] <%Gogogolem> pat you actively liter.
[2:24:32] <%arancet> pat with fuck-you money would doom the world
[2:24:32] <+EdgyOnPorpoise> You ARE rich, Pat
[2:24:35] <+LeoStrahl> @PeachSaliva You're the one who got him with a Patty though?
[2:24:36] <$El_Desperad0> This IS work
[2:24:38] <%ryome> Pat gonna go full ME~ when he's safely out of the reach of Retail
[2:24:39] <TheOriginOfAll> @AngriestPat @PeachSaliva i keep getting bodied, what kind of knot should i tie for my noose?
[2:24:40] <%iwishthiswasicq> The difference is the hamburger wrappers will be full instead of empty.
[2:24:40] <@PeachSaliva> He’s just mad because I litter burgers in his house
[2:24:40] <+Dogbert24> you're already a litter fiend
[2:24:41] <+The_UnfathoMarble> I mean, you get to prove yourself right, that's pretty clever
[2:24:44] <@lewdskeletor13> You’re rich in LOVE Pat
[2:24:45] <+XxBTExX> Its certainly way more work than I currently have.
[2:24:49] <%Niney_Who> Pat's autopilot mode is so weird
[2:24:53] <%ElenaManetta> HAS ANYONE HeRE TRiED TO PLAY A VIDEO GAME WHILE YOU CONSTANTLY TALK AND PLAY? WHiLE YOU CHECK CHAT. iT'S HARD
[2:24:54] <%king_wragles> Peach is here, everyone freak the fuck out
[2:24:58] <+whoguru5> @AngriestPat you gotta put up with chat so i'd say this is hard fucking work LUL
[2:24:59] <Hentietachi> Paige is rich in lupus
[2:25:03] <%king_wragles> I SAID FREAK THE FUCK OUT a
[2:25:05] <%brave_sj> "Oh no, I have to wake up at noon and play video games" Kappa
[2:25:10] <gryffinp> The answer then is for pat to not read chat
[2:25:15] <%Frost_Quill> If I was crazy rich I'd set up a call center that in every WAY sounded like a scam, but if you fell for it I'd GIVE you money. And then I'd not do it like two days before it started because I'd realize it would make people more likely to fall for scams.
[2:25:16] <aimlesshealer> LUL
[2:25:20] <reonome> LUL
[2:25:21] <OkamiDude15> playing and talking is very difficult

[3:22:11] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> welcome to your permanent fixture
[3:22:12] <%skizzuto> this music is giving me deja vu and I don't know if it's from a different game or from when I last played this one
[3:22:13] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@2017y) (warning)
[3:22:14] <JazzyJulZ> CLANK
[3:22:17] <ミュウレ4242> because a hookshot is a real thing, and not a trademark.
[3:22:18] <%theAncopro> Dedicated badge spot
[3:22:24] <%toastybites> !uptime
[3:22:25] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 22m.
[3:22:34] <+Grayhammatter> wow, look at this windwaker shit
[3:22:41] <Rubecks> Hooksht should be an umbrella upgrade
[3:22:44] <+Cryghoul> swang
[3:22:50] <2017y> premiere windwaker high iq hookshots
[3:22:51] <%CommanderSqueaks> Windwaker without Tingle.
[3:22:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> 200% improved
[3:23:07] <2017y> windwaker without the cutscene playing every time
[3:23:07] <ZippyPsycho> Did Pat do the level where he has to sneak around a house?
[3:23:18] <nutimik> just listen for the sound
[3:23:19] <Ris_Eltrut> @zippypsycho no
[3:23:21] <Alchemystee> sekiro looks different
[3:23:25] <2017y> im hoping he doesnt
[3:23:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> Windwaker Link is the best Link tho.
[3:23:31] <OkamiDude15> @ZippyPsycho thats probably the next one
[3:23:38] <+Cuon_Alpinus> hookshot refreshes you air acitons, too
[3:23:42] <%ryome> This game is super cool, if I didn't hate platformers, I would pick this up
[3:23:44] <%PROUD2beGINGER> Don't touch the water
[3:23:45] <+SweatyMercury> Im upset tingle wasnt int Breath of the Wild
[3:23:46] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Any idea how far you are into this game yet? Have you reached the 50% mark?
[3:23:54] <+Grayhammatter> oops, now we're drowning
[3:23:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> Sweaty why
[3:24:01] <2017y> including the dlc? not even close
[3:24:06] <%weissguard> So this is just the Lost Woods, right? Kappa
[3:24:11] <mesamus> the drums kick in Kreygasm
[3:24:12] <Lapinelis> Will you complete it?
[3:24:15] <Prevot> the fastest hookshot in the west

[3:24:26] <FirearmsInstructor> lol is she saying "swing"?
[3:24:27] <$Vanessa_Ui> @AngriestPat Have you considered playing Pathfinder Kingmaker?
[3:24:29] <vVAstrAVv> level 3 of 4
[3:24:29] <pmtriox> how many hats and how many times did you put them in?
[3:24:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Okay, can we just take a second to talk about how the music is simple, but awesome super awesome?
[3:24:34] <%Piemen99> i thought he was almost finished
[3:24:37] <Megapikman132> the dlc adds a lot to the game
[3:24:40] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> this is what yooka laylee should have been
[3:24:41] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@moink1234) (warning)
[3:24:41] <yodajr99> This is just luigi mansion
[3:24:42] <%Dovahthing> DLC has some of the best levels too
[3:24:47] <mrgrimsmiles> @AngriestPat will you be playing this paige ?
[3:24:50] <$SleepyMaribo> you need almost all the yarn in the game for the final hat
[3:24:52] <+HellCopter> Is this like that level from Voodoo Vince
[3:24:55] <%moink1234> You have now entered a social contract
[3:24:56] <Valfar45> remember you have to give us our money back if you change your mind Kappa
[3:24:59] <+Spec7re> pat also has the DLC to go
[3:25:00] <Megapikman132> yeah. the map will help a lot with that
[3:25:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> 100% only means getting time tokens. Yarns and Pons don't matter for completion.
[3:25:01] <$SleepyMaribo> did he finish dead bird studio?
[3:25:04] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> lots of yarn fo dat sweet sweet hat
[3:25:05] <yodajr99> this song is straight a rip from luigi's mansion
[3:25:12] <%FrustratedAF> this game is fuckin fat with content, huh?
[3:25:14] <CurrySauseBandit> @Piemen99 This has a nice bit of content and he's still doing the easy stuff.
[3:25:15] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> my favorite looking hat in the game.

[3:25:17] <+TONYOO101> will you and paige ever play the coop for this?
[3:25:18] <%PROUD2beGINGER> You... did it
[3:25:19] <smegma_sorcerer> having the water level rise is a clever checkpoint mechanic
[3:25:20] <warmnoid> Colonel, we managed to avoid drowning!

[4:07:56] <+MugenSandan> Hey Pat I recently got back into FF14 and while a level 57 DRK vs a level 60 WAR isn't totally fair I absolutely understand what you mean by the fact that SB ruined DRK even without a full kit they feel so boring to play and it feels like during SB they had no idea what to do with it. Compare it to Warrior whose game plan is super simple (just UNGA at your enemies) but every ability in their kit works towards a real purpose.

[4:09:06] <%bluetocho13> dont look at my Lala like that
[4:09:07] <%ryome> dumb bitches in chat
[4:09:07] <%Promessa_EX> i do
[4:09:09] <+BioHunter> what leaks we talkin about?
[4:09:10] <%Nobrev> moms can have brothers too
[4:09:12] <%Conyst> because
[4:09:15] <CrowXIV> hwa?
[4:09:16] <r_Foeburden87> ya u have two
[4:09:16] <ShichiNoBushi> Brother to your father.
[4:09:16] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god Pat just admit the job flew over your head
[4:09:17] <%zeroarturia> Oh god damn it
[4:09:19] <FeelinNifty> here we go again woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO woolieDATTEBAYO
[4:09:20] <+SolverCODO> both are pretty likely, neither side should assume. Chat assumed one thing, Pat assumed the other
[4:09:20] <takiyami> Most people want a son and not just a daughter
[4:09:20] <%MagickBurritoh> Everyone has uncle
[4:09:21] <%AncelDeLambert> *joke
[4:09:23] <%voidthieff> I dont have a maternal uncle
[4:09:26] <SpaceGuntank> they're really commited to that joke arent they?
[4:09:29] <%theAncopro> my ma dont got a bro
[4:09:29] <Delenay> ive got a maternal aunt who then married someone
[4:09:32] <%nmaten> in laws are still siblings pat
[4:09:32] <%skizzuto> most people aren't only children, so likely to have a brother
[4:09:33] <$El_Desperad0> so.....3
[4:09:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> BOTH VALID
[4:09:36] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Pat stares at Pat sneaks at Pat leaks at Pat shits at
[4:09:38] <RupanSen> yes but one doesn't exclude the other
[4:09:39] <%salty_syd913> most of the questions like that state that its your mothers maiden name
[4:09:39] <+Eclipse_knight_> its not, its an old joke
[4:09:40] <%Promessa_EX> No you are more likely to have a maternal uncle
[4:09:40] <+chaumiester> By that reasoning. The average person has.... a mother and or a father
[4:09:41] <T_Sasquatch> the JOKE is that its asking you for security questions. THUS it should me your mom, for the JOKE
[4:09:42] <%ElenaManetta> But it was just doing a security question joke!
[4:09:44] <+SolverCODO> All uncles are valid
[4:09:45] <prophetdisharmonious> my uncle is younger than me
[4:09:47] <BobaFetish2124> the average person is 5ft 10
[4:09:50] <+MugenSandan> What if I told you that you could not only fell cleave but also FELLER cleave
[4:09:52] <redial_nick> they do if they are alive is a different matter
[4:09:56] <+Reizie_Etherealm> It's a pretty bad joke
[4:09:57] <%Mrbaconator> WHAT
[4:09:58] <%ElenaManetta> You're supposed to read it and think your mom because "your mom's maiden name" is a common security question, that's why everyone jumped to YOUR MOM thing

[4:28:17] <+oOZtkOo> oooh
[4:28:22] <2017y> real smn
[4:28:26] <+BioHunter> no way
[4:28:27] <@SSaryn> And THIS is why I wanna play SMN again.
[4:28:28] <2017y> its been 86 years
[4:28:29] <+Grayhammatter> real summoning!
[4:28:29] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Dancer does “Twerk”
[4:28:31] <r_Foeburden87> FFXI summoner YAY
[4:28:31] <@JustinianKnight> yep
[4:28:33] <+jack0spade> same!
[4:28:35] <Nobuwaroo> yooooooo
[4:28:36] <haisho> that sounds...too good for Summoner
[4:28:39] <cirticalexistencefailure> Summoner sounds insane
[4:28:40] <+trashamn> time to go back to smn
[4:28:41] <+oOZtkOo> as in they summon for attacks?
[4:28:44] <%theturtlebar> What is pat reading?
[4:28:49] <Kurrisum> I hope it's real
[4:28:49] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I need to refill the salt just so I won't expect any of this crap
[4:28:50] <Valfar45> SMN is more like a bahamut cultist instead of a real summoner
[4:28:56] <ShichiNoBushi> Like Yuna in Disidea 2?
[4:28:58] <%laserbeaming> Except in FFX
[4:28:58] <+Innocuous_Goat> Like Yuna in the Dissidia games
[4:28:59] <+oOZtkOo> that could be cool
[4:29:02] <+Slivis117> As a SMN main I'm super exited for this
[4:29:04] <+TendrilsTwitch> Yuna class would be hot shit
[4:29:05] <TyrantBelial> There is an exception. FFX, which hasd the best summons
[4:29:05] <Thalchampz> @theturtlebar allegedly, FFXIV leaks
[4:29:08] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> @theturtlebar A really bad GameFaqs fan fiction?
[4:29:09] <haisho> so you're now FFX summoner
[4:29:11] <@JustinianKnight> its not gunna be
[4:29:13] <CurrySauseBandit> FFX has the best summons though, but I guess the rest of FF is really just stands.
[4:29:15] <cirticalexistencefailure> Jojo class
[4:29:15] <+Grayhammatter> i WILL main summoner if that's the case
[4:29:19] <OkamiDude15> now you can be V PogChamp
[4:29:20] <@JustinianKnight> NINJA
[4:29:22] <+Estuko> @ShichiNoBushi yooo Dissidia Duodecim is the BEST
[4:29:22] <@SSaryn> If they do this to SMN, I'm a SMN main avain.
[4:29:25] <+Kurogane_Dread> WOOLIE TIME
[4:29:28] <$Valdorick> Aw man, they RUINED the class Kappa (but not really)

[4:29:48] <+preppyposs> roll action that resets cooldowns?
[4:29:50] <+DeniedPants> double pot?

[4:30:06] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Alright hear me out people, what if SAM gets a trait that lets you dual wield katanas at lvl 80?
[4:30:06] <Scline> This is what I meant by the person who did the pastebin must have been on drugs or something. lol
[4:30:06] <%Divryne> STANDO POWAH.
[4:30:09] <@JustinianKnight> yea maybe
[4:30:17] <%skizzuto> dark knight does his own thing, ninja copies you
[4:30:17] <Lunatyr_> everyone gets stands
[4:30:18] <Monkeyweed21> STAND vs SHADOW CLONE
[4:30:18] <Tucker0603> STAND GAME!
[4:30:19] <%Taisuru> I'm assuming these clones must be using the Trusts AI
[4:30:23] <Scline> Some of it just gets pretty hard to understand.
[4:30:26] <Lunatyr_> You get a stand, you get a stand
[4:30:29] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat This is the Jojo Stand expansion.
[4:30:32] <+Grayhammatter> that's busted LUL

[4:30:43] <%Niney_Who> And Shadow Clone is just copying you
[4:30:44] <IndoorSitup> n00b here, are all these changes gonna be retroactive for previous levels??

[4:35:31] <T_Sasquatch> 4chan has real leaks more often than you'd think
[4:35:31] <%Conyst> the real truth is they are just making it into a Wow clone
[4:35:32] <$Valdorick> Summers now have a spell that lets them summon summoners, who can then summon more summoners so you can summon summoning summoners summoning summoning summoners.
[4:35:32] <%Farples> That's all I want

[4:37:17] <+Kurogane_Dread> DRK image leak and this 4chan leak are conflicting
[4:37:17] <prophetdisharmonious> honestly if it sounds too good to be true it usually is, but if it sounds too bad to be true, it usually isn't
[4:37:17] <%MrSuperCasualBoom> Bard: Run Away and hide faster like ProJared’s existence

[4:39:35] <$OmegaWeltall> healers adjust LUL
[4:39:44] <@SSaryn> Role Actions we KNOW are going
[4:39:45] <+DoctorDerp388> tank stances too difficult for NA
