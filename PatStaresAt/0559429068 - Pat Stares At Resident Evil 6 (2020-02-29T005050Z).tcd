[0:45:39] <ScreamLord> Plaay Dragon's Dogma
[0:45:40] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt I think the creators of this part of the game, watched a bunch of National Treasure and assumed this is how America is.

[0:46:26] <%solidousstream> @patstaresat why doesnt the game play switch there?
[0:46:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's amazing when you make the bullshit in RE5 and Revelations look absolutely believable by comparison.
[0:46:28] <%happyface699> THE LIGHT IS A LIE

[1:01:03] <biomegabear> Dark souls with guns
[1:01:04] <%mankeytennis> Use Ancient American C-4
[1:01:04] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I think it's fucked up that after this, all Capcom had to do was say "hey, what if we DON'T make the next game total garbage?"
[1:01:07] <PabuPanda> ISN'T A MANSION JUST A SERIOUS OF CORRIDORS, THOUGH?

[1:02:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> What is this House of the dead nonsense
[1:02:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> They should not have come into this catacomb area without climbing gear. What were they thinking?
[1:02:07] <%linkster291> Honestly think this over, this is all connected to a bio lab from some evil conspiracy. None of this is actually ancient. So that means that the evil American Conspiracy purposefully made the caverns connected to their lab look like an ancient burial ground. And that makes it even dumber.

[1:02:18] <Punisher7771> pat its just a crawl
[1:02:19] <%Frost_Quill> So I just got here this stream, if she actually dies is it a game over or does the story change?
[1:02:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> What is an RE game? Just a miserable pile of corridors.
[1:02:22] <%JJCheeker> Mulder I need your help

[1:23:16] <rubbishbinge> Leon is why there a damn barricade in front of my door

[1:23:18] <%Mr_Pylon> It'll fart to slow down
[1:23:18] <+TheBitingIrish> I don't care what kind of creature it is; if it hit pavement at terminal velocity, it would be paste.
[1:23:18] <+griffball13> leon s kennedy historys greatest monster
[1:23:19] <Dr_Mooose> *virus
[1:23:21] <shardlab> That thing is a damned bomb

[1:23:30] <%tank7013> @PatStaresAt That thing isn't what causes the big gas, so Leon's crimes are erased Kappa
[1:23:30] <%Shadicara> it'll still fart when it dies LUL
[1:23:30] <BeefyQueefer> Hitting the group at terminal velocity isn't going to destroy the T-Virus farts inside it.
[1:23:30] <%Laecerelius> It should just liquify but it's a magic zombie so I'm gonna assume that it's fine
[1:23:32] <%Sir_stride> @tusk102 so a hand full of people die
[1:23:32] <nuane> they'll shoot it down\
[1:23:32] <C24U> Why are you not infected?

[1:23:32] <derap41> terminal velocity is relative to size and mass
[1:23:33] <%trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt you find it later in jake and sherrys campaign dead
[1:23:33] <42nfl19> PAT NO WANT SHINY
[1:23:33] <Escherite> SO WHAT IF IT HITS THE GROUND AT TERMINAL VELOCITY, IT'S SHITTING OUT THAT GAS ALL THE WAY DOWN
[1:23:34] <Kemmybelle> don't try to fly the plane over an ocean first or anything.
[1:23:34] <Zerud> I think I saw an emblem to shoot
[1:23:34] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> gg leon
[1:23:35] <Dhurkst> Leon "coronavirus lover" Kennedy
[1:23:35] <%alcors_wisdom> i mean it should
[1:23:36] <%debugdrawray_> whoever made this bullshit had no sense of scale
[1:23:38] <%peachy996> Zombie passengers of course
[1:23:38] <AncientToco> Leon saved the president’s daughter, he’s earned a mass murder or two
[1:23:39] <David0838> This is the ending of Leon’s campaign right?
[1:23:39] <%budyd> but think of the goo left over
[1:23:40] <+GenocidalWaluigi> Doesn't Simmons launch c virus missiles into China?
[1:23:42] <Veltlore> lol dude blood is still infectious even when dealing with a dead body
[1:23:42] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> How did they NOT get infected!?!?
[1:23:42] <Frostydough1> Also the gas would dissipate look at purple haze @PatStaresAt
[1:23:44] <%valriot> OKAY THAT WAS SICK THO
[1:23:44] <theaterunderground> China? or Helena?
[1:23:44] <myriad_truth> Yeah, in Chris's story its already there.
[1:23:44] <%corepercentlives> that's not good I need to crash this bitch
[1:23:45] <Ner234> How are they infected
[1:23:46] <thelonechris> This is like that part from World War Z
[1:23:46] <%shiplord13> How are they infected but not Leon
[1:23:46] <auraofdawn> oh leon honey nooooooooo
[1:23:46] <th3_magicman> I give up
[1:23:46] <boomstickery> stop firign liek that on a plane leon
[1:23:47] <%tusk102> @Sir_stride all of those people become zombie who then infect more
[1:23:48] <%YakumoYomi> The monster isn't the issue later on. Something MUCH worse happens.
[1:23:48] <%Shadicara> Fuck the passengers
[1:23:50] <+Pookiedaexzile> How is he shooting in a plane
[1:23:50] <KingKZ> It's a RE monster. Terminal velocity probably makes it stronger.
[1:23:51] <Tersalus> now HE is the bioterrorist!!
[1:23:52] <dukenux> [Dramatization of COVID19 outbreak]
[1:23:53] <%GabeSweetMan> NICE
[1:23:54] <%Niney_Who> Leon is too strong to be a zombie
[1:23:55] <RyanTheRecluse> The gas disperses a few seconds after being released and it will just pop when it hits the ground
[1:23:55] <rcand9> re 6 writers don't know no terminal velocity
[1:23:55] <biomegabear> WHY ARE YOU NOT INFECTED
[1:23:56] <%professormorrigan> THE GLASES

[1:24:01] <%Aracon_> this is just a mess
[1:24:02] <%linkster291> Leon's got anti bodies.
[1:24:02] <%sporeian94> Leon and Helena have naturally immunity
[1:24:03] <%Das_Bass> THIS GAME IS FUCKING STUPID
[1:24:03] <daisyyyy> leons exposure to las plagas makes him immune
[1:24:04] <+neeto_makar> green herbs i guess
[1:24:05] <%Mister_McDerp> Leon is strong
[1:24:05] <Mr_Strut> Leon can hold his breath for a LONG time
[1:24:06] <%Niney_Who> They were weak
[1:24:06] <Zerud> protagonists are imunne
[1:24:07] <PirateMike_> Are you immune for some reason?
[1:24:07] <Nekros4442> PROTAGONIST POWERS ACTIVIATE
[1:24:08] <AFlyingTaco1> It's FIIIIIIIIIINE
[1:24:08] <Dr_Mooose> just walk it off
[1:24:08] <+NitronStreams> PROTAGONIST IMMUNE SYSTEM
[1:24:09] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Sure, that makes sense.
[1:24:10] <Dragon_Batman> I love that sunglasses thing to be honest
[1:24:10] <C24U> Just give up Pat
[1:24:10] <Aydarkzero> he was just too cool for ya Kappa
[1:24:10] <%PlagueOfGripes> "Leonavirus-19 hit big china today. Still number 1"
[1:24:11] <th3_magicman> This is the WORST
[1:24:11] <%JJCheeker> they don't have plot armor though
[1:24:11] <wrightlight94> Plot armor tho
[1:24:11] <crimsonsaens> Leon is immune
[1:24:11] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt Leon and Helena ate their Wheaties
[1:24:11] <%EuropanLamprey> This is "Shut up" the game
[1:24:11] <Daxalog> Regular Green Herb ingisetion does that to you I guess
[1:24:11] <dukenux> Airplane! with zombies
[1:24:11] <%templar010> TIC TACS
[1:24:12] <%GarbageQueenEllie> they coulda just blown up the plane
[1:24:12] <lionandfox21> Does that mean the gas is heated? Cause that explains the movement but still tho
[1:24:13] <+griffball13> @PatStaresAt you take herbs so ti's fine
[1:24:14] <%Meekest> Does this game have any files? For reading?
[1:24:15] <Draco_Renegade> Don't think about it Pat.
[1:24:15] <boomstickery> why are all the nnemies such jobbers?
[1:24:15] <%Frost_Quill> Is Leon immune?
[1:24:16] <shardlab> Don't you need hours for T to turn you?
[1:24:16] <pfctwinkletoes> It's a given that RE protagonists are immune to the virus.
[1:24:16] <%ChaosAethr> STop Asking Question
[1:24:16] <%supersugoisenpai1> Leon is immune now
[1:24:18] <Dhurkst> Is it just be, or does this game graphically not look as good as RE5?
[1:24:18] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Its so fucking dumb
[1:24:20] <+BurkeBigsby> Damn they made shotgun look like it fells like ass
[1:24:21] <seniortrump> wee
[1:24:22] <GamingPhobic> HAHAH LUL
[1:24:23] <%valriot> CLASSIC. STYLE. RESIDENT EVIL.
[1:24:23] <%LaughingCatt> Its almost like this game is f***ing stupid

[1:24:23] <%Sir_stride> @tusk102 in a world already accustomed to bows

[1:24:24] <%GabeSweetMan> LOL
[1:24:25] <theaterunderground> the power of love @PatStaresAt
[1:24:25] <%Erimos> It's always been absurd that none of the protags get infected ever.
[1:24:25] <%alcors_wisdom> well leon is immunized because of the los plaguas
[1:24:25] <trianglehat> ROGER
[1:24:27] <%happyface699> Super immune

[1:24:31] <%templar010> SHOOT MONSTAR
[1:24:33] <dukenux> Dont ask questions. Consume virus.
[1:24:33] <%bensonplayspokemon> Rub some dirt on it
[1:24:33] <bxdragon> By this point in the series Leon has been exposed to Las Plagus along with the T and G virus so he would be fine I guess. So why isn't the bitch a zombie though?
[1:24:34] <derap41> Cannon never being bit I accept this this is dumb
[1:24:34] <rytisone> Leon's aryan genes are saving him
[1:24:34] <boomstickery> wtf was that
[1:24:35] <C24U> DEAD
[1:24:36] <ScreamLord> Let's also remember that thing was probably nipple-farting virus gas the ENTIRE TIME it was falling into the middle of what looked like could have been New York
[1:24:37] <%AxelCezar> leon has already so many viruses that is like Mr Burns system

[1:24:56] <neVan0> LUL
[1:24:56] <%LaughingCatt> To a LUDICOURS degree
[1:24:56] <%shiplord13> You should be crashing son
[1:24:56] <%Meekest> NO TIME
[1:24:56] <auraofdawn> it was not only for nothing ON THE PLANE, but is also gonna kill a million people on the ground
[1:24:56] <boomstickery> no the palne should be on auto pilot
[1:24:56] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 24m.
[1:24:57] <%sporeian94> LEON GOING FULL HOMELANDER
[1:24:57] <KingKZ> YES
[1:24:58] <LeftOverPizza13> all the gunshots should've fucked the plane
[1:24:58] <%professormorrigan> auto-pilot
[1:25:00] <dukenux> PULL UP PULL UP
[1:25:01] <%Shadicara> Leon huffs those viruses daily man
[1:25:01] <AFlyingTaco1> It should have crashed by now, probably
[1:25:02] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> they shouldve crashed like 5 mins ago
[1:25:02] <biomegabear> PRESSURIZED AS FUCK
[1:25:04] <derap41> You should have about 4 minutes of free fall assuming its gliding
[1:25:04] <+Ckarasu> It's clear that every RE protag is just immune to every virus. Such good writing.
[1:25:05] <+PanicSwytch> IT SHOULD'VE FALLEN A WHILE AGO
[1:25:05] <%faronmcsalty> idk this plane is magic. has humongous bank vault grade steel doors n stuff
[1:25:05] <+Starlight_Gamer> autopilot, but yeah
[1:25:06] <%Helmed> i told you about them stairs bro
[1:25:06] <boomstickery> nothign should really be happneing
[1:25:07] <+Grayhammatter> if it went SIDEWAYS like that? yes
[1:25:07] <%XeroSigmaPrime> ALL COMMERCIAL PLANES HAVE AUTPILOT
[1:25:10] <%Erimos> "this is fine"
[1:25:10] <C24U> NICE GOING
[1:25:10] <+ORGANizerC> leon's just referencing his favorite movie, the dark knights rises
[1:25:10] <%Aracon_> they should be spiralling out of control
[1:25:11] <%GabeSweetMan> How did this mammoth go 90 degrees and back that fast.
[1:25:11] <%D3rrtyD4n> big boops and beeps
[1:25:11] <Dragon_Batman> I think it might be that while it was traveling through the vents it disperesed gas and then it came to you, also your not getting hurt so no gas is around, it makes no sense but yea
[1:25:11] <%happyface699> They are fine
[1:25:11] <%Frost_Quill> Might be an auto-pilot keeping it somewhat stable.
[1:25:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Autopilot is great
[1:25:11] <%budyd> it looks pretty fucked
[1:25:12] <dukenux> LUL
[1:25:12] <%Conyst> completely fucked
[1:25:13] <%valriot> Maybe they have immunity via herb overdosing for like 20 years
[1:25:14] <Grennold> Remember, ths is the classic survival horror campaign LuL
[1:25:14] <crimsonsaens> Using guns in planes is generally a bad idea
[1:25:14] <Skibopadoo> also you know, the whole shooting guns inside a plane
[1:25:15] <Hydrapissed> pat is in so much pain
[1:25:15] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> This game is proof that stream boost sales, after this stream i really need to buy this game
[1:25:16] <%Dante_Magnum> DIO
[1:25:16] <%twohitgood> it shouldn't be fucked but it also shouldn't be flying on its side ever.
[1:25:16] <%dayz1003> FLY THE PLANE, LEON

[1:25:29] <%DensityD> there's no time
[1:25:31] <%Conyst> yes

[1:25:38] <%D3rrtyD4n> evo19MindBlown
[1:25:39] <derap41> I've seen this movie
[1:25:39] <trianglehat> letting the pressure out doesn't destabilize the plane, it just means YOU CAN'T BREATHE
[1:25:40] <thelonechris> "Turn this big motherfucker left, Troy!"
[1:25:41] <boomstickery> autooppilot is on bbut shitty?
[1:25:42] <%tusk102> @Sir_stride and, as the first chapter shows, are horrible with dealing with since they just had to nuke a fucking city. so yeah i think its a problem that one infected some people
[1:25:43] <%GabeSweetMan> BEEP BOOP
[1:25:44] <%Aracon_> PAT YOU KILLED EVERYONE

[1:25:54] <dukenux> @patstaresat obviously the low pressure and virus cancel each other out. duh
[1:25:56] <stealthfart> Open windows and air may be offsetting it but I don’t know

[1:25:57] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> WHY A QTE
[1:25:57] <iamnotaparrot> just firing your 50 bullets in the plane should irreversibly fuck the pressure and would likely make you pass out

[1:30:52] <derap41> Agreed
[1:30:53] <iamnotaparrot> sherry having the healing factor is absurd

[1:30:56] <jorniev> TRUTH

[1:31:00] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt sherry re8 blz

[1:31:03] <%bensonplayspokemon> Facts

[1:31:05] <%Faustgesicht> SHerry Deserved better
[1:31:06] <%cdrom321> @PlagueOfGripes But Ustanak is Eastern European.
[1:31:07] <%GabeSweetMan> I love her design at least.
[1:31:10] <+TheBitingIrish> PLEASE bring these two back for RE8
[1:31:11] <%alcors_wisdom> wait doesnt that mean leon like 40 now
[1:31:12] <%valkuma> and with JACOB

[1:31:13] <SuperHoppedUp> Jake punches good
[1:31:14] <cgame_me811> 100% agree pat SeemsGood
[1:31:14] <%Helmed> Sherrys lore is horrible though. tortured for half her life and then tortured once more with jake
[1:31:14] <%Frost_Quill> This seems like a "it's so bad it's good" kind of situation so far. I just got here for this stream.
[1:31:14] <Bustahhwulf> leon in police shop class finally pays off
[1:31:14] <%stevesekai> I had a friend join me in co-op for this section and it started him with only a handgun with one clip worth of ammo and the hydra with no ammo
[1:31:15] <%Shadicara> Deserved better than bootleg Nemesis
[1:31:16] <%NoctisxMog> i loved playing as sherry
[1:31:17] <+ktothec99> So much wasted potential
[1:31:17] <%YakumoYomi> Sherry's great
[1:31:17] <Punisher7771> the bus should not work regardless
[1:31:20] <%Laecerelius> Really?
[1:31:20] <iamnotaparrot> sherry is in the same jail that Billy and Sheva are in.
[1:31:21] <C24U> They gave her lewd costumes in this game. Now imagine her original appearance
[1:31:21] <%GabeSweetMan> JPEG
[1:31:21] <trianglehat> Jpeg engine
[1:31:22] <$PaleBloodInk> There's always hope for RE8 or 9.

[1:31:35] <GamingPhobic> GAMEPLAY
[1:31:35] <Jolly_Adventurer> LUL
[1:31:36] <stealthfart> The fact she has a healing factor that is not implemented in the game proper is bull
[1:31:37] <+ORGANizerC> Luckily leon is adept in bus hackery
[1:31:38] <%peachy996> You would think Jill is also a mutant
[1:31:39] <boomstickery> sorry what? oh yeah drama

[1:31:44] <%Totally_not_toby> oh noooooooooo
[1:31:46] <rubbishbinge> She's Wolverine now
[1:31:46] <shardlab> Well, you don't have super scientist parents and not be a mutant
[1:31:47] <+ktothec99> The music is telling me it's dramatic
[1:31:49] <Pwgregory> Does the remake of 2 make Sherry being an agent non canon now? Because ya the only decent thing about this game.
[1:31:50] <lionandfox21> She is the only survivor of a G virus infection
[1:31:50] <MayorRev> hey does Sherry have superpowers
[1:31:52] <+Grayhammatter> there is NO reason for it to go THAT FAST
[1:31:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> This will get himf ired
[1:31:52] <%KaosMachina> Does that make things make more sense
[1:31:53] <CatTully> LOL
[1:31:56] <ItsAGundamu> This game seems more time crisis than anything with the amount of quick reaction prompts there are
[1:31:56] <+Antoids> WITH NO SURVIVORS

[1:32:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> To be fair they are getting attacked by terrorists
[1:32:07] <C24U> 9/11 level shit
[1:32:08] <stealthfart> Sherry has a healing factor only
[1:32:08] <%bevyrage> yeah if he wasn't seen as a terrorist before HE WOULD DEFINITELY BE ONE NOW
[1:32:09] <+CounterBeard> Nah it's fine
[1:32:09] <%Frost_Quill> He prevented it from crashing WORSE though?
[1:32:10] <Jolly_Adventurer> It's fiiiiiine

[1:32:11] <boomstickery> @PatStaresAt maybe hes a massive racist?
[1:32:12] <Yadogari> It's only china don't worry
[1:32:12] <+Starlight_Gamer> its a write off
[1:32:12] <tigerfang86> NO TIME
[1:32:13] <lionandfox21> @MayorRev The G virus gave her a "healing factor"
[1:32:15] <AFlyingTaco1> Yeah he'd be executed or some shit
[1:32:15] <Punisher7771> like a war would start
[1:32:16] <SaltyAzteca> TIC TAC PogChamp

[1:32:17] <stranger59> You mean this BIO-TERROR ATTACK?
[1:32:19] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt Just blame it all on Simmons
[1:32:19] <+Antoids> this boss is a big guy.
[1:32:19] <myriad_truth> Hes definitely a Terrorist
[1:32:19] <rytisone> there were no choice
[1:32:20] <rcand9> dont worry about it
[1:32:20] <th3_magicman> NO TIME PAT, stop thinking
[1:32:21] <%Erimos> Nah, they could just say it was a result of the outbreak.
[1:32:21] <%EuropanLamprey> It's actually just Chinese 9/11
[1:32:22] <%Mister_McDerp> WAR CRIME
[1:32:23] <+Ilpala> the minor genocide he committed in Europe wasn't enough?
[1:32:23] <%Totally_not_toby> hes running away hes scared
[1:32:24] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt paid administrative leave at the very least LUL
[1:32:24] <%budyd> can't be an epidemic if there are no people alive

[1:32:25] <a_mad_dragon> Resident Evil 8 : Leon vs Zombie China
[1:32:25] <%chaumiester> eh, just blame Simmons
[1:32:26] <%Totally_not_toby> he doesnt like it
[1:32:27] <%Sir_stride> well to be fair it's not really his fault
[1:32:27] <%GarbageQueenEllie> How tf do you become a terrorist by ACCIDENT?
[1:32:27] <%CalebHatesGames> Pat, it's a zombie world. I don't think anything else is important.
[1:32:27] <jorniev> LOOK IS THE CORONA TYRANT
[1:32:28] <crimsonsaens> China is pretty chill, I'm sure it'll be fine
[1:32:29] <derap41> @tank7013 so a bit like Wesker
[1:32:29] <ahbhajit> Leon was dead Pat, it's cool
[1:32:29] <%sporeian94> Also where the fuck is Jill during all this?
[1:32:30] <+Grayhammatter> stop thinking pat
[1:32:31] <SkyPirateArcane> Honestly there's so much fucking shit happening it'd just be swept under the rug I feel
[1:32:31] <+tsatoma> All these viruses will just give super powers in the future
[1:32:32] <SuperHoppedUp> You have to compare it to all the other shit that happens in this city
[1:32:33] <dukenux> WAS THAT PART OF HIS PLAN?
[1:32:33] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt vs what? It crashing naturaly in the city?
[1:32:34] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Implying China gives a shit about its people
[1:32:34] <%Aracon_> giant claw
[1:32:34] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> There would be a war or something.
[1:32:36] <CatTully> Where he going
[1:32:36] <+thackattack00> "I would like to point out" is becoming the "You know what I mean?" of this LP
[1:32:37] <%GabeSweetMan> YO das a cool arm tho
[1:32:37] <%nofestu2> WHAT
[1:32:38] <+ORGANizerC> @sporeian94 crying
[1:32:38] <+Pookiedaexzile> Wesker did it
[1:32:38] <%ares92822> A super international problem
[1:32:38] <+BionoidLCR> USTANOK
[1:32:39] <thelonechris> WHAT
[1:32:39] <%tusk102> yo that arm sucks
[1:32:39] <SuperHoppedUp> like there is a floating city that got NUKED
[1:32:40] <MayorRev> @lionandfox21 weird but cool
[1:32:40] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> SWORDMASTER
[1:32:40] <LustrousDust> Pat, you're thinking again.....
[1:32:42] <+luketrapwalker> WHERE DID HE GET A CLAW
[1:32:42] <%Typhaeon> Just sitting up there?
[1:32:42] <%AxelCezar> he just carries that thing around?
[1:32:43] <Ki_Memento> doodLewd
[1:32:44] <%Frost_Quill> The pilot was literally turned into a zombie, they stopped it from crashing STRAIGHT DOWN.
[1:32:44] <thebladeshield> STARS
[1:32:44] <myriad_truth> Yeah, what is Jill doing during all this???
[1:32:46] <%juxtest> It was all the work of Nuevo Umbrella
[1:32:46] <ItsAGundamu> oh is that Laura Baily?
[1:32:47] <%tusk102> GUN TRICK SWORD
[1:32:47] <%ElkRiverDog> Winnie the Pooh would certainly be grumpy
[1:32:48] <bxdragon> How is it smart enough to do that? How was Nemesis smart enough to do something similar?
[1:32:48] <%ChaosAethr> THATS FUCKN DUMB
[1:32:49] <%alcors_wisdom> well aperently if that mutant guy was already running around this place was already fucked right
[1:32:49] <TheWe4pon> Is this Wuhan? @PatStaresAt
[1:32:49] <rubbishbinge> It's OK, no one likes Shanghai
[1:32:50] <theKingRamses> to be fair it's not like leon put the giant tit monster on the plane
[1:32:50] <+neeto_makar> So is this guy literally just like Chinese Nemesis?
[1:32:53] <%budyd> the hoobastank looks dumb
[1:32:55] <anAngryHamster> Catastrophic Shenanigans should have been the subtitle
[1:32:55] <Hydrapissed> also wtf is that even supposed to be a claw to kidnap people?
[1:32:56] <Ipsenscastle> USTABIAZ
[1:32:57] <Hydrapissed> why?
[1:32:57] <Dragon_Batman> I imagine their excuse for Sherry having healing factor is because her father infecting her helped cause that
[1:32:58] <SuperHoppedUp> This is a world that is used to constant terrorist attacks
[1:33:00] <pfctwinkletoes> How did Leon get like 30 guns through airport security anyways?
[1:33:01] <%peachy996> I really hate the timing for Banter in this game
[1:33:03] <%tank7013> @derap41 Kinda, but because of G virus instead of T and Uroboros. Jake is a LOT more like Wesker for good reason
[1:33:04] <%radda343> the bolt action sound effects re literally the same as re5
[1:33:05] <%peachy996> It's really lame
[1:33:07] <%Mister_McDerp> but hes lame tho
[1:33:07] <%Shadicara> Like a bootleg he comes with a million replacement parts LUL
[1:33:08] <+TheBitingIrish> LUL HE JUST KEPT GOING
[1:33:10] <Hydrapissed> why cant he just pick someone up and put them in the cage?
[1:33:11] <lionandfox21> But no Claire or Jill fam
[1:33:12] <%stevesekai> To emphasize how bad this game is, I had a friend join me in co-op for this and it gave him no extra guns and only one clip of ammo for the handgun
[1:33:13] <Hydrapissed> why have a claw arm?
[1:33:14] <rcand9> he aint no nemi
[1:33:15] <%D3rrtyD4n> he is forgettable and his name sucks
[1:33:15] <+NitronStreams> Junkyard Nemesis
[1:33:16] <+Yakobro> ???
[1:33:17] <%spiritofmojave> Really that's it LUL
[1:33:18] <%bevyrage> wait did he get taken out
[1:33:18] <thelonechris> How convienient
[1:33:18] <%Aracon_> ????
[1:33:19] <LeftOverPizza13> was that a bane zombie
[1:33:21] <+Antoids> WAS GETTING CRUSHED BY A RADIO TOWER PART OF YOUR PLAN TOO
[1:33:21] <$floralkami> @neeto_makar no, cause it's from Russia
[1:33:24] <%bevyrage> by something beyond your control
[1:33:24] <+ORGANizerC> the brightest fucking thing in the universe
[1:33:26] <worldbrand> psaDab
[1:33:26] <th3_magicman> God this makes me want Res 3 even harder
[1:33:27] <+TheBitingIrish> @Hydrapissed His mission is to retrieve Jake

[1:59:30] <C24U> Shot the ceiling more Pat
[1:59:30] <OldOnyx> you say that like it's a stretch compared to shit that's already happened IRL (well, minus the bio monsters)
[1:59:30] <%mankeytennis> Fleshimus Prime
[1:59:32] <%morcego_cinzento_arts> Yeah i'm totally gonna buy this patriot, love my country talk from a guy that turned his assistant into Ada's copy against her will and turned Helena's sister into a monster even though Helena did keep her end of the deal
[1:59:32] <+Pookiedaexzile> Animorphs style
[1:59:32] <CrimsonFox777> Remember chat: Somebody thought this was a good idea.
[1:59:33] <%craftyraichu> Probably still painful as fuck tho
[1:59:33] <$floralkami> EVEN THE ABILITIES COMING UP
[1:59:33] <tigerfang86> I CLAPPED WHEN I SAW THE REFERENCE
[1:59:34] <%Dapper_Cactuar> full control AND you still keep your mind
[1:59:34] <Hydrapissed> even gets to TURN BAK to a human
[1:59:34] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt AND let;s you keep a humanoit form with reletively little mutation
[1:59:35] <SaltyAzteca> Pat, short, contrlled bursts
[1:59:35] <Hellarussian> Birkin was the shit
[1:59:36] <%necrocannibal2> what even is the downside?
[1:59:37] <+StickonATree> but you got no dick
[1:59:39] <cgame_me811> No thanks LUL

[1:59:46] <Dragon_Batman> Honestly this whole sequence is Birkin References
[1:59:47] <%alcors_wisdom> well i mean he has a virus so of course hes sick
[1:59:48] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> that's a cool running shot down the train
[1:59:49] <%Frost_Quill> @PatStaresAt So does it hurt him when he shifts and transforms?
[1:59:51] <Dhurkst> If you can maintain control & morph back into human form at will, there are seemingly no downsides
[1:59:53] <dukenux> Holy shit Pat, youre right. A T Virus(?) actually working as intended.
[1:59:54] <%vectorless_peon> I remember this now hes like a meat transformer! How utterly retarded!
[1:59:55] <+senatorarmstrong_2020> this is prolly the best out come for becoming a fleshbeast
[1:59:55] <Dragon_Batman> Like passed this
[1:59:56] <manoshake> no dick downside
[1:59:57] <%tusk102> @Frost_Quill probs not
[1:59:57] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Why didn't Ada just KILL him? Snipe him out or whatever
[1:59:58] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> IMMORTAL DOG, HE WON'T TRUST YOU

[2:02:06] <%tusk102> @Sphincter_Spelunker i doubt he would be talking shit if it was horribly painfully
[2:02:07] <Dutchpotato> @IndoorSitup maybe u should have higher standards

[2:15:08] <%faronmcsalty> i guess in theory this is much worse than raccoon city, cause RC was like 100k people, this city is probably several milliion people
[2:15:08] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt people with many gun

[2:20:24] <%ECRead> correct
[2:20:24] <%TheMattman1313> For the most part yeah
[2:20:24] <myriad_truth> Humvees are pretty sturdy
[2:20:24] <AMERICA_YEA> yeah it's totally secure but not airtight lol
[2:20:25] <+ZephynM> Humvee is a armored Hummer or whatever. Your bare body won't do squat to it.
[2:20:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> so in the Resident Evil world, everything is fucked by all the dicks, right?
[2:20:26] <Centrilion> Also not airtight
[2:20:27] <+DRAGKUDO> I mean the gas would get inside
[2:20:27] <%warmnoid> Leon feels his war crimes crawling on him
[2:20:27] <%NeroInfinite> funfact....the miltiary humvees are shit.
[2:20:28] <Divantae> everything about the presentation of this game is so questionable how and why
[2:20:29] <Dead_trickster> HUMVEES suck, as someone who has been in them, they suck.
[2:20:29] <derap41> Unless they have the key no

[2:20:30] <thelonechris> Was the truck just trailing fartgas?
[2:20:31] <seniortrump> nothing
[2:20:32] <+Toblo1> Zombies have no sense of self-preservation
[2:20:32] <%king_wragles> @Hydrapissed not a tank, but much heavier than a truck still
[2:20:32] <SGrim> @PatStaresAt it's specifically designed to prevent that actually.
[2:20:33] <+tsatoma> I didn't realize humvees were air tight. They weren't when I was in them
[2:20:33] <$PhantomMiG> It has a open top for a gunner
[2:20:33] <%YourFavoriteShiba> IT'S DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE
[2:20:33] <%croxeye> i like how the gas is just not in that area
[2:20:34] <usurper_sos> Doesn't Leon need a gas mask???

[2:29:26] <fallenverto81> You can punch a bitch in Chris' campaign.
[2:29:27] <+ledgefiendd> this game would've fit better as like a zombie spin off of uncharted
[2:29:27] <%the_vedo_show> atpCap CapGods were at it
[2:29:27] <%Nope80808> This game operates entirely on Fast and Furious rules.
[2:29:28] <natebud> As opposed to the campaigns that weren't for anyone
[2:29:28] <th3_magicman> This is the worst it's ever been
[2:29:29] <%DensityD> jesus christ, leon just die already. quit outrunning the grim reaper

[2:29:33] <rcand9> FOR FANS
[2:29:34] <%chambatron> I played his and Jake's but didn't bother with Chris'
[2:29:35] <Dragon_Batman> They really only meant the first chapter and lied about the rest

[2:29:36] <%Mister_McDerp> how horrifying
[2:29:36] <%xxshadowxx416> this not action
[2:29:36] <SchroedingersFerret> YUH
[2:29:37] <%13ry4n93> how

[2:29:41] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @kewlmyc RE 5 pretty much, th gun sections

[2:29:42] <tiaramaki> HOW DID THE FLOOR NOT COLLAPSE UNDER THEM?
[2:29:42] <%Takreth> He says as the helicopter crashes through the glass pane
[2:29:42] <%Mr_Pylon> I mean, do you consider Uncharted survival horror?
[2:29:44] <stranger59> And Leon's is by far the worst.
[2:29:44] <rytisone> cinematic survival horror
[2:29:44] <%ChaoticWaha> Hi Future me :O

[2:29:44] <ranarath> Capcom just wanted cool things to happen, not make sense.
[2:29:45] <%dayz1003> isn't the chris campaign basically just a cover shooter?
[2:29:45] <Veltlore> wtf

[2:29:45] <%ElkRiverDog> There’s plot armor, and then there’s broke

[2:33:58] <nuane> conservation of who???
[2:34:01] <thelonechris> This is stupid even when compared to the rest of the series
[2:34:01] <SixthSun2> Ouroburos loves conservation of mass
[2:34:02] <%RowenCleric> this dude is just Akira
[2:34:02] <Axle13j> the virus just makes more
[2:34:02] <Nekros4442> LITERALLY THE PREVIOUS GAME OBEYED THE CONSERVATION OF MASS AND NOW FUCK IT
[2:34:02] <usurper_sos> KNIFE HIM

[2:34:14] <%madskull456> i was literally thinking about making a stupid t rex joke because of the crazy action, this is the first time i see this game too...
[2:34:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> At least Oroboros ate biomass around an individual to create big monsters
[2:34:19] <JackalKing> The trick is that the mass is conserved. When in human shape he is incredible dense, and when in T-rex shape he is just hollow
[2:34:19] <%DensityD> what a good clip
[2:34:20] <+AbnormalVoid> I'

[2:37:28] <Divantae> this fight is the definition of 'wait for cutscene'

[3:36:14] <karl_rex> SO ENGAGING
[3:36:15] <%SWFanatic> Press X to Chris
[3:36:15] <jack_is_here> no need to be worried chris could bench press that building
[3:36:15] <nuane> did they just tank a fucking RPG
[3:36:16] <%Mister_McDerp> that couldn't support chris's bulk

[3:36:25] <jacknerik> ResidentSleeper
[3:36:25] <%Ran196> why do they all have gun?
[3:36:25] <%ccwettr123> Gotta say, Capcom sure does know how to reduce, reuse and recycle
[3:36:25] <%DensityD> jesus christ Christ is Huge

[3:36:27] <Monkeyweed21> wiggle the buttons and hammer the sticks
[3:36:27] <marlowe86> Most modern weapons are phalic symbols. Missiles, bombs, etc.
[3:36:27] <godlesscruelty> what is the fucking point of this
[3:36:27] <$PhantomMiG> Stormtrooper aim
[3:36:27] <%sleepy_coffee> So if you shoot the enemies in the dick then their dick'll become a monster?
[3:36:28] <+burkey0307> what am i even looking at
[3:36:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> @HyperionXV good to see some soundbytes here
[3:36:28] <+Slice_of_Kris> i am going to go home and climb a pole
[3:36:29] <kiso52> can paige come back? this is trash
[3:36:29] <thelonechris> Is it?
[3:36:30] <+Neale2theMusic> this is giving me army of two flashbacks
[3:36:30] <%G_Thunders> Am I wrong or is his amnesia literally just alcohol-induced?
[3:36:30] <+TheBitingIrish> Do people not know what muscle memory is??
[3:36:31] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> This seems fun
[3:36:32] <%peachy996> Hey Piers! I saved your ass now touch my ass....I mean save
[3:36:32] <+Starlight_Gamer> where is the child swing?
[3:36:34] <+waltzqueen> Can we please put this back on mute?
[3:36:38] <Dutchpotato> yeah it's great
[3:36:39] <%Aracon_> it's actually insane
[3:36:39] <AnacondaVirtue> RE7 is a miracle
[3:36:39] <%XeroSigmaPrime> RE7 IS A FUCKING GODSEND
[3:36:40] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd atpRtsd
[3:36:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> So bad
[3:36:41] <%professormorrigan> Damn, RE7 was a REAL step down
[3:36:41] <natebud> And Rev2
[3:36:41] <Snektor> yup
[3:36:42] <+Target616> IF ONLY THEY FIRED AT WHERE YOU ARE INSTEAD OF WHERE YOU WERE
[3:36:42] <biomegabear> SHUT UP
[3:36:43] <%faronmcsalty> man THANK GOD RE7 and RE2R are good
[3:36:44] <Hadeshero1> thank god
[3:36:44] <Animorphimagi> Nope
[3:36:45] <%JJCheeker> They really did not playing this game out well
[3:36:45] <tactician0> NOOO
[3:36:45] <%SWFanatic> At least this isn't Star Trek Picard
[3:36:47] <%Das_Bass> @PatStaresAt IGN gave this game a 7.9/10
[3:36:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ccwettr123 DID YOU SEE THE RE7 boxes in the latest R3MAKE trailer?
[3:36:48] <%blankwaffle> re7 and remake2 are great
[3:36:50] <%SvenHolgersson> I'm surprised 7 even came out holy SHIT dude
[3:36:50] <AFlyingTaco1> Hey can you, like, play a good game now?
[3:36:53] <keatiestofthegribbles> thiss yaoi doujin is not really poppin
[3:36:54] <AutechreTwinAphex> this is probably the 'best' campaign of them all - jake is probably the worst
[3:36:54] <%GabeSweetMan> RE7 was potentially saved by the influence of PT.
[3:36:55] <Gamester091> If you don tplay on the playground youre dead to me
[3:36:55] <%DensityD> CVX THO
[3:36:55] <%ladomania> yeah but Jake does punch
[3:36:56] <+ledgefiendd> Oh my god RE7 looks like RE4 compared to this
[3:36:56] <%Aracon_> RE7 and RE2make are literal miracles
[3:36:57] <Nekros4442> Can this just be a cooking stream with Paige....I dont want to live in this RE6 present
[3:36:58] <%peachy996> RE2 and RE3make are just going to head back to this RE6 shite
[3:36:58] <+TheFabledAble> yea its fucking insane how much better those games are
[3:36:58] <%Keyd00d> I need to replay 7 after this
[3:36:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> This makes RE7 look like a masterpiece (still think it's midtier but still)
[3:36:59] <%JJCheeker> plan
[3:37:00] <yoshkosh20> can't wait for remak3
[3:37:02] <Mnightshyamallama> ngl the most cofusing thing i have seen so far is chris's health bar
[3:37:03] <AFlyingTaco1> Like just start a new playthrough of RE7, fuck it.
[3:37:04] <+loukemia83> pAIGE SHOW US THE FISH
[3:37:05] <+Slice_of_Kris> do you think re4 remake is next or is that too far
[3:37:05] <ShichiNoBushi> I recently got RE7 for to play on PSVR and haven't done so yet.
[3:37:07] <cgame_me811> Yeah LUL
[3:37:08] <myriad_truth> A HUGE leap
[3:37:09] <+badjab326> ***
[3:37:09] <Firesparks> can we just skip this and go to relevantion 2?
[3:37:10] <Dutchpotato> @professormorrigan gamingbrit is that u Kappa
[3:37:11] <%Agami23> pat. my brother hates re2make. how do i tell him he is dumb?
[3:37:11] <usurper_sos> hmmm
[3:37:11] <PirateMike_> RE7 is actually the only RE that I liked
[3:37:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> Re3Make is gonna be so good
[3:37:13] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> fish pudding
[3:37:13] <%Mister_McDerp> SHOW SALMON
[3:37:14] <%spiritofmojave> that jump LUL
[3:37:14] <stranger59> This is the true face of horror
[3:37:17] <+TheBitingIrish> @G_Thunders A mix of alcohol and suppressing traumatic events, which is absurd because he's been through worse shit
[3:37:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> There's literally RE7 boxes in R3Make.
[3:37:19] <+loukemia83> SHOW FISH ON STREAM
[3:37:20] <%Meekest> First Chris beat up POC in Africa, now he's beating up POC in China
[3:37:20] <nuane> CRAB ARMS
[3:37:20] <Firesparks> I want more red head coop
[3:37:20] <Hydrapissed> wow that looks dumb
[3:37:20] <Snektor> SALMON PUDDING
[3:37:22] <%Scarnehu> fish pudding
[3:37:24] <%the_vedo_show> Crab battle
[3:37:25] <%tank7013> "Backwards to quality" is such a weird phrase but it applies perfectly here
[3:37:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Shoot their legs
[3:37:28] <%Aracon_> what is with these fuckin spaghetti monsters
[3:37:32] <Jolnir> I like re6
[3:37:34] <AutechreTwinAphex> yeah even as a straight shooter - RE5 is a better game - the enemies just suck to fight against
[3:37:35] <%Meekest> Why does Chris keep killing minorities
[3:37:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> @CommanderSqueaks There are so many reused models in RE2Make from RE7
[3:37:36] <set29> Ehh I think RE7 takes a huge nose dive after you leave the house
[3:37:36] <Fdrank> that guy lifts
[3:37:37] <%KitkatRai> KitkatRai subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Oh fuck I forgot to turn this shit off again fuck god dammit
[3:37:37] <kiso52> SALMON MOUSE ON A CRACKER
[3:37:38] <ranarath> The pudding... of their DOOM!
[3:37:39] <FirearmsInstructor> Don't let bernie sanders know you have pudding. He wan sum of ur puddin...
[3:37:40] <greatspaceadventure> this game looks genuinely bad to play for entirely the wrong reasons
[3:37:40] <+ledgefiendd> Does your knife do more damage or your gun butt?
[3:37:43] <tiaramaki> Wouldn't fish putting be just fish chowder?
[3:37:43] <AFlyingTaco1> How did they manage to make a game like this be so fucking long?
[3:37:43] <keatiestofthegribbles> Re7 is only good until the boat
[3:37:46] <sothatsprettybrutal> the proof of the pudding is in the eating
[3:37:48] <+luketrapwalker> The screams in this game are ridiculous LUL
[3:37:48] <cgame_me811> Remaking RE4 DansGame
[3:37:49] <chronoxgp> psaBlep_SG Didn't want to be....... That guy!?
[3:37:50] <%the_vedo_show> atpRtsd atpRtsd
[3:37:51] <tigerfang86> HOw can this BE
[3:37:51] <tiaramaki> *pudding HECK
[3:37:52] <%GabeSweetMan> More shoot bangs!
[3:37:53] <alexandrecau> aim better
[3:37:53] <%professormorrigan> i miss sheva. i wish i was back in africa
[3:37:53] <+zcairstrike> Why the fuck are the gun bashes so good in this game?
[3:37:54] <%D00msDayDan> i deadass love the roll into shooting on your ass, it's like vanquish but way dumber
[3:37:55] <AutechreTwinAphex> why did they make a different UI for each character? all of them suck too
[3:37:55] <%spiritofmojave> cause you're in CONSTANT CONFLICT
[3:37:57] <%xUmbraNinja> Inf ammo
[3:37:58] <biomegabear> BUT SAVE AMMO BUT USE AMMO THOUGH
[3:37:58] <+TheBitingIrish> USE THE KNIFE, IT GOOD
[3:37:59] <%Sycada> It's to add to the FEEEEEEEEAAAAAARRRR
[3:38:00] <FatherGreyBeard> Those upgrades you DIDN'T equip
[3:38:01] <%Mister_McDerp> where sheva?
[3:38:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Th3SmartAlec I think it's cause the boxes are covered in stupid yellow tape it sticks out the most.
[3:38:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That's how you know it's survival horror :)
[3:38:02] <+SuicidalLemmming> wouldnt be so bad if you hit your shots
[3:38:02] <+Lost_Zombie> But its the action section so why aren't they flooding you with ammo...
[3:38:03] <codycurry52> You missed a bunch of shots though
[3:38:05] <+Qsmash_> You gotta conserve ammo. This isn't an action game Kappa
[3:38:08] <%peachy996> Why do Chris and Leon have different Inventory Styles?
[3:38:10] <Hydrapissed> can we go play vanquished?
[3:38:11] <derap41> Don't woory they'll give you a shit ton more
[3:38:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> @set29 Yeah, the Grenade launcher and Magnum have no real use other than the fatties, and the Flame thrower is only good for bugs
[3:38:15] <Dutchpotato> it puts u in action game situations while giving the ammo of a survival horror
[3:38:17] <+DiabloDeAzul> mercenaries mode is more generous, but only for zombies
[3:38:22] <%peachy996> Also STOP saying Ace of Spades
[3:38:23] <AutechreTwinAphex> the big problem with this game when played as a straight shooter is that these mobs aren't fun to fight against
[3:38:25] <%Scarnehu> because they want you to run, not engage the game
[3:38:31] <myriad_truth> At least you haven't died yet
[3:38:32] <%trekkie11041> @PatStaresAt you can change your sets in the pause memu
[3:38:32] <%GarbageNirvana> The fuck are these lame Tyrant wannabes
[3:38:34] <%the_vedo_show> PUNCH
[3:38:39] <+Vanargandknight> It's not like you're fighting zombies who previously had weapons and should DROP AMMO or anything.
[3:38:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> @set29 And I feel the house had a big issue with just stuffing all the enemies in the basement
[3:38:40] <%JJCheeker> Are you on PC can you cheat?
[3:38:43] <%sleepy_coffee> thick punches
[3:38:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Now I have "The Ace of Spades" poping off in my head
[3:38:45] <%DensityD> psaGoblin
[3:38:46] <natebud> just leave

[3:39:20] <%sleepy_coffee> i find it silly that Chris can never be on alpha team
[3:39:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat is going to do this the hardest way possible just to SPITE US.
[3:39:21] <%SvenHolgersson> YOU NOT ONLY CHEATED THE GAME BUT YOURSELF
[3:39:22] <Flamecap1> Pat would NEVER
[3:39:22] <biomegabear> CHEATS BUT STILL DONT MAKE MORE FUN
[3:39:24] <AutechreTwinAphex> what I don't get is why the game is such a downgrade from 5 - it doesn't look better than 5 and all the changes to the gameplay just suck
[3:39:26] <%Keyd00d> I really hope going forward that they're more like 7 and way lower scale. Never do this again

[3:39:46] <+swaggopotamus> Or at least consistent in tone.
[3:39:48] <ricky12k> Just cheat pat so we can get to the better re games.

[3:51:24] <greatspaceadventure> there's no sense of rising tension
[3:51:24] <%NekoUrabe> So re7
[3:51:25] <Dutchpotato> Ammo is low despite wave after wave of enemies

[3:55:22] <startstoprepeat> graphical quality is mostly taken as a given now, games are sold on STYLE
[3:55:22] <%Mister_McDerp> OPINION VS FACT
[3:55:24] <stranger59> She means it's not "16-bit graphics!" or easy to distill buzzwords in ads
[3:55:24] <usurper_sos> that is HER TRUTH
[3:55:24] <%Jokobeast> [FBI WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION]

[3:55:29] <APB_Harleqyn> Paige has a point - graphics went from a selling point to an expectation, there is a difference.

[4:00:08] <vvitchguy> This is boring. At least Leon was stupid-hilarious.
[4:00:09] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Paige is an undereaged pelican confirmed.
[4:00:10] <ShichiNoBushi> She did that thing where she looks up with her open mouth, inserted the fish into her mouth whole, and pulled just it's bones back out.
[4:00:11] <+TheFabledAble> Graphics are like 90% of the time a conversation of realism and the convo about realism has definitely died down in recent years. Graphics talk typically is not the same thing as fidelity, animation, or art direction. the complaint with pokemon was the animation quality, the obssesion with crysis was its realism, the anger with blighttown was its frame rate; not the graphics.

[4:04:53] <stealthfart> Watch the cg movies with Paige.
[4:04:54] <lionandfox21> So that begs the question: Re6 or CVX as the worst?
[4:04:54] <%Aleate> No Kappa
[4:04:54] <+NitronStreams> Ive onlt scene Chriss story before this stream

[4:04:58] <EdeninShambles> Oh yeah
[4:04:58] <T_Sasquatch> its awful , it may as well not be RE
[4:04:58] <%Shadowpint> It's not great but I think you're overblowing it
[4:04:59] <+A0N33> It's in So-bad-it's-good territory for me
[4:05:00] <%Neo_Kaiser> It's bad on a repeat playthrough
[4:05:00] <General_Terro> i want to dig my eyes out
[4:05:00] <+Lunarhawk> I'll accept you stopping RE6 if the streams are replaced with Paige playing Dragons Dogma
[4:05:01] <%akaAxi0m> CVX is my favorite.
[4:05:01] <%republicofu> OH YES IT IS
[4:05:01] <%DensityD> CVX IS BACK IN!!!!!

[4:05:06] <+AcidBrandon> It hurts just to watch it
[4:05:06] <%happyface699> So ducking bad
[4:05:07] <Dragon_Batman> I think it beats out CVX only because it feels better to play
[4:05:07] <%spiritofmojave> THE ACTION SHIT IS SO GOOFY THO
[4:05:08] <FstSergeant8595> Zero isnt that bad
[4:05:08] <%kikanshat0masu> Nope lol

[4:05:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It's even worse than I thought, and I played the beginning like hour before
[4:05:11] <%Shadowpint> CVX and 0 are way worse you're crazy
[4:05:11] <+PanicSwytch> THE TIER LIST KEEPS CHANGING
[4:05:11] <koffeemancer> the most Ive seen of this game was that one time Conan O'brien played it
[4:05:11] <Pwgregory> I knew it was bad and I don’t regret making you play this or me watching it.
[4:05:12] <DashXero> Hey, Pat, could you put it to a vote whether RE6 continues now that people know what they've voted for?
[4:05:13] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> so what's the ranking?
[4:05:14] <%xxshadowxx416> you have to finish it
[4:05:14] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> i dont know about that last part
[4:05:14] <%the38bandit> It trying too hard to do too much
[4:05:15] <%KeystoneA1> @PatStaresAt Yeah. But it's fun watching your soul slowly evaporate, so keep playing.
[4:05:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> I can't wait to watch the WHOLE THING @PatStaresAt
[4:05:18] <%peachy996> Zero, CVX and 6 are on the same level
