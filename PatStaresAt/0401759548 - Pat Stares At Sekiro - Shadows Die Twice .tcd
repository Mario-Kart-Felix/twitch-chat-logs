[0:15:26] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Is it fair to compare Stands to SCPs?
[0:15:46] <%connos_livereview> is this why kirby is the way he is
[0:15:48] <augusm> The fact that you and Woolie aren't doing a playthrough of Sekiro together might actually be a crime in Canada. I'm not sure
[0:15:49] <%docpepperphd> ooooo
[0:15:49] <%Reizie_Etherealm> None
[0:15:51] <%SrG00SE> @HentaiSenpai9K havent heard that comparison but at first glance thats fair

[0:17:44] <%Edgy_Macaroon> newbies are hard to play against. you don't know what they'll do
[0:17:46] <%Typhaeon> Don't worry, it happens with AMD too
[0:17:49] <hussdogrob> Pat and Woolie will be opening the Rooster Teeth Montreal Branch where they teach improv all day
[0:17:50] <$cureneckbeard> Remember how well save manipulation worked in the Dark Souls III run? You got Crazy Talked pretty hard on that one

[0:18:42] <Finaldragoon> that's a weird way of saying Mystic Knight
[0:18:42] <%0dokuro> Kinda, Tales of Xilia are different
[0:18:45] <Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 Thanks for quoting me on the podcast the other day, and having it late so I could watch it around my classes. would you believe that comment was based on 5 seconds of woolie gameplay, and only listening to your playthrough? I DMed a steam key to paige on twitter because i already owned it, make sure you use it.
[0:18:45] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Sorcerer tho

[0:25:21] <+dtogo> @mostundesired Camera sure aint nice to Woolie either LUL
[0:25:30] <whycans> how about the shield aka the umbrella

[0:25:48] <%lovebass4stuff> greedy
[0:25:48] <abakkus> so whats even the deal with this boss? there's just a demon now? i definitely missed lore...
[0:25:49] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat Finger whistle is very helpful during this fight

[0:26:38] <garbageheaphound> woof
[0:26:40] <Thalchampz> wow hi buns, didn't expect you here
[0:26:40] <%supersugoisenpai1> I gave up on the game at the third boss. Just casually walking in on this Bloodborne fight.
[0:26:44] <%Reizie_Etherealm> We should do the opposite of complimenting pat so that crazy talk will be in our favor
[0:26:52] <+oOZtkOo> the sculptor succumbed to his own hatred and karma from being a shinobi he became a shura
[0:26:53] <+dtogo> @mostundesired hes still learning the fight but the camera and the wall are really screwing him at times
[0:26:53] <%Metaljohn117> superbutterbuns?!
[0:26:58] <abakkus> man if "become a demon" is the end result of the rot thats ROUGH

[0:27:53] <%deserter_hedwyn> when the fuck does THIS GUY appear???
[0:27:56] <thevaliantheart> Wait. You have 20 Vitality in the first play through? How even??
[0:28:03] <FiftyFiveP> We still got no idea what "Shura" really is other thna the fact that apparently shinboi's can succumb to it? Or something
[0:28:06] <%waifoong98> @deserter_hedwyn at Ashina 3.0

[0:28:16] <+cascadepersona> Crotch camera is a terrifying enemy
[0:28:19] <+oOZtkOo> shura is another name for asura, a demon of wrath

[0:29:25] <%waifoong98> @FiftyFiveP not sure where tbh but I rmb that is explained in the game.
[0:29:25] <+TheoTTree> Did you just say SIX to go
[0:29:26] <thevaliantheart> @fiftyfivep Shura seems to be a warrior overcome with bloodlust. I noticed there are praying old women spread throughout the world and they cower when you arrive.
[0:29:27] <abakkus> me, dying for lore, desperately clawing at the wikis to get infodumped on,,
[0:29:32] <+oOZtkOo> @Saltmeisterr i cant remember, if you stick around the memory should explain
[0:29:33] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I hope the game will explain itself soon cause we're nearing the end, but I'm worried that the explanation won't be enough to help us understand everything
[0:29:35] <%lewdskeletor13> It takes a high IQ to beat this boss

[0:31:55] <+cascadepersona> I wonder what the experience of playtesters are for these games
[0:31:56] <thevaliantheart> @gregoryjk16 Did you choose to fight Owl? There are some in the final area and two more bosses around Ashina. So you‚Äôd be missing two that are locked behind another route.

[0:32:54] <%bevyrage> is there a particular reason why you're not punishing the flame core slam?
[0:32:55] <%cerazor01> Divine Confetti always helps
[0:32:58] <%waifoong98> at least there is no run back to the arena so that's nice

[0:36:13] <+cascadepersona> The RE7 finger? Kappa
[0:36:18] <$D4C_Trice> was that owl???
[0:36:23] <+thebackwardslegsman> There is no way they don't launch DLC for this.
[0:36:24] <+oOZtkOo> all the ninja are named after animals
[0:36:26] <%laserbeaming> Kingfishers are really cool birbs
[0:36:28] <thirstyskaven> Bird DLC
[0:36:29] <RyanGelatin> the re7 de3mo finger
[0:36:31] <%waifoong98> inb4 Tomoe in this game is just Tomoe Gozen Kappa
[0:36:33] <TempestaDePrimo> Uhh the surge?
[0:36:34] <weontheultralightbeam> there better be dlc üò°
[0:36:36] <+Maids4lyfe> so all of the shinobi are named after animals?
[0:36:36] <%lewdskeletor13> Sci Fi Fromsoft is just Metal Wolf Chaos
[0:36:41] <thirstyskaven> Birds die twice
[0:36:42] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Wait, I thought the sculptor referred to the monkey valley friend as a he?
[0:36:46] <+Maids4lyfe> Owl, Wolf, Butterfly, Kingfisher
[0:36:47] <garbageheaphound> probably not considering the finger was in the Guardian Apes stomach

[0:36:53] <+asperger_mode> how do you fight this guy?
[0:36:55] <%Metaljohn117> @lewdskeletor13 Good!

[0:37:10] <+oOZtkOo> yes
[0:37:10] <%waifoong98> @UnfilteredComic yep
[0:37:11] <Saltmeisterr> I like how all the shinobi have animal names
[0:37:11] <+cascadepersona> I really want to see Fromsoft go back to Armored Core, admittedly
[0:37:11] <%Metaljohn117> that's what we need
[0:37:13] <+Maids4lyfe> there's time travel in the game @garbageheaphound
[0:37:15] <$SleepyMaribo> that last swing should have killed you
[0:37:19] <%waifoong98> @cascadepersona same, feelsbadman
[0:37:32] <%lewdskeletor13> I doubt mech games sell as well as these games
[0:37:34] <TyroneRugen> I miss one stream and it turns into darksouls
[0:37:35] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Armored core is still in development, keep waiting
[0:37:36] <%Mev852_> I thought pat got better at Royal Guard?
[0:37:38] <garbageheaphound> In fact i bet the sword in the Guardian Ape's head belonged to Kingfisher
[0:37:39] <+TheoTTree> When Sculptor was a shinobi he was called Monkey wasn't he
[0:37:43] <+TheoTTree> PogChamp
[0:37:45] <RyanGelatin> nice bag hits
[0:37:48] <+oOZtkOo> he was called orangutan
[0:37:49] <%waifoong98> I need indepth mech and number tweaking reee
[0:37:50] <FiftyFiveP> orangutan
[0:37:53] <+cascadepersona> @waifoong98 We can only hope for mech games to make a big return with Fromsoft

[0:38:05] <jubejube56> oh dear how long has pat been fighting the sculptor? saw this last stream too
[0:38:11] <%deserter_hedwyn> was that sculptor's axe you get in hirata estate then?
[0:38:15] <FiftyFiveP> wonder how many times he can actually use the finger
[0:38:19] <RyanGelatin> i would say im disappointed i got spoiled on the sculptor becoming this but whatever i did this to myself
[0:38:23] <FiftyFiveP> gascoigne was like 2 times max
[0:38:26] <%mostundesired> apatDab
[0:38:26] <%Ion_Laser> apatDab
[0:38:26] <aimlesshealer> I dislike looking at his bag area
[0:38:27] <thirstyskaven> nice
[0:38:27] <%lewdskeletor13> Maybe we‚Äôll get DLC where you play as a younger sculptor
[0:38:30] <%Typhaeon> All of that bag-shaking practice with Elmo has paid off
[0:38:30] <Marpolo13> he just sttarrted @jubejube56
[0:38:30] <SweetestEggplant> @AngriestPat why is your devil breaker on the wrong arm?
[0:38:31] <RiverBirch> Y'know what this style of boss fight reminds me of?
[0:38:34] <RiverBirch> Anybody remember Furi?
[0:38:35] <%Mev852_> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:38:37] <%SrG00SE> looks like the cost is 4 so you can probably use the finger 3 more times
[0:38:43] <+TheoTTree> Furi is the shit
[0:38:48] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I feel like FROM won't' ever go back to the original tenchu now that they have this and that saddens me deeply
[0:38:49] <+TheoTTree> More people need to play Furi
[0:38:53] <%Piemen99> Has pat made it to the third life of this guy?
[0:38:56] <fazoburquina> wait, why is pat fighting Bloodstarved beast?
[0:38:57] <TyroneRugen> @RiverBirch That game is rad
[0:39:00] <%bevyrage> not that i've seen
[0:39:03] <%Metaljohn117> Paaaat, you don't walk into the swings
[0:39:06] <%waifoong98> @Reizie_Etherealm tbf they never made those original games
[0:39:08] <RiverBirch> Do ya'll see the comparison?
[0:39:08] <jubejube56> furi will forever live on in the OST
[0:39:10] <$NocturneNovember> Did the Furi guys make anything else?
[0:39:11] <%waifoong98> that's Acquired
[0:39:11] <Mastigias> Wait, can you grapple to him during the fire wall? Or am I seeing that wrong?
[0:39:12] <+TheoTTree> Has Pat played Furi?

[0:48:34] <ZComiX> thx
[0:48:38] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat The final boss is Gwyn
[0:48:43] <whycans> tomoe is dead
[0:48:47] <+oOZtkOo> i think it is
[0:48:52] <+TheoTTree> Corrupted Monk is my favourite
[0:48:52] <Marpolo13> that's tru
[0:48:55] <MarylandJutsu> You didn't like the Dragon Fight @AngriestPat ?
[0:48:57] <SnaKemuho> but the cool dragon tho
[0:49:03] <thirstyskaven> mirror match
[0:49:03] <SunsetJack> Failed Shura?
[0:49:05] <%mastertwin2> So Vergils are the best Souls bosses
[0:49:05] <BakerBrute> Imagine not having Ape Escape as your favorite boss
[0:49:06] <$Tuskor13> I think my favorite part of the initial release of a FromSoft Soulslike is everyone trying to figure out the lore together
[0:49:08] <%waifoong98> Also Max fell apart because he is too stubborn to turn off the hardmode bell LUL @AngriestPat
[0:49:08] <FiftyFiveP> Huh a failed shura
[0:49:09] <+oOZtkOo> guardian ape is one of my favorites because it Jebaited me so hard
[0:49:13] <whycans> time for memory
[0:49:14] <jacob2pop> @angriestpat Genichiro is such a rival character it hurts
[0:49:15] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> Tomoe is the dragon you took the tear from no?
[0:49:18] <abakkus> ok so he's not A Shura then.... whats shura....
[0:49:18] <%lewdskeletor13> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of confusing‚Äù- the summary of any Fromsoft game
[0:49:18] <Spyderninja> Watching you fight Genichiro on the tower helped me beat him, thank you
[0:49:20] <+Wintermute_VRC> Guardian Ape fight was fucking rad
[0:49:21] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat owl has basically your prosthetics and your habilities like mikiri, so cool
[0:49:26] <Mastigias> Wait, then what's an ACTUAL shura?
[0:49:28] <+skylerpilot> @angriestpat did you ever find out Owl can Mikiri counter you if you charge attack him?
[0:49:34] <+PrimordialDonut> Does this game explain what it means to be a Shura?
[0:49:36] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I love fight against an equal to prove who is stronger, I don't like fighting against crazy demons with magic
[0:49:36] <Saltmeisterr> genichiro is a big vergil
[0:49:41] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat The Divine Dragon was almost a pure spectacle fight
[0:49:47] <dagrum> shura is another way to say asura
[0:49:48] <MarylandJutsu> wait who stabbed what now?
[0:49:54] <MarylandJutsu> GEinchiro is BIGGEST VERGIL
[0:49:55] <$SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat the Genichiro was the fight that sold me on this game.
[0:49:55] <Monkeyweed21> firecrackers work on human bosses
[0:49:57] <Ner234> @skylerpilot He did. Several time LUL
[0:49:58] <%RogueCrocodile> Shura is basically RAGE from mk vs dc
[0:49:59] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat but you could see the dragon sword they changed it probably at the last moment to not look like the moonlight great sword
[0:50:04] <+skylerpilot> lol
[0:50:07] <MarylandJutsu> Genichiro is also voiced by Ray Chase
[0:50:08] <+Punchasaur> @arfsm95 do you just spam until he responds? you got your ass blown out for that last stream
[0:50:08] <%SrG00SE> apatBig OWL2019200iq
[0:50:12] <+TransporterX7> HAHA, pat seeing the ending any time soon
[0:50:13] <$D4C_Trice> Shura is some kind of demon god?
[0:50:13] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Asura is the god of wrath and hatred right?
[0:50:20] <+skylerpilot> lost my shit when it happened to me. it was so cool
[0:50:21] <$anime_boyz> i find that sabimaru sucks for bosses for the amount of spirit emblems you use up for 1 proc
[0:50:23] <Marpolo13> guessing we going for save scum endings to get them all?
[0:50:32] <+oOZtkOo> i dont think itll kick you to an ending
[0:50:38] <WreckItRaz> just got to my final boss. gonna be spankin' that ass in the morning.
[0:50:39] <%lewdskeletor13> We‚Äôre doing big save scumming

[0:50:47] <%lewdskeletor13> apatDab
[0:50:48] <Marpolo13> works for me
[0:50:48] <$NocturneNovember> Pat locked himself out of the bad ending
[0:50:48] <$Tarcanist_> did you ever find the lost child and where did you find it? @angriestpat
[0:50:49] <%SrG00SE> as you well god dam should
[0:50:49] <MarylandJutsu> BIG SCUM
[0:50:50] <%waifoong98> The true Pat's way LUL
[0:50:52] <+oOZtkOo> i think you gotta go through the secret passage to get the endings now

[1:03:35] <%lovebass4stuff> doctor
[1:03:35] <+TheoTTree> Imagine if Wolf shouted FUCK YOU and flipped the bird while awakening his WOLF STAND
[1:03:35] <Monkeyweed21> read the description
[1:03:38] <%mostundesired> @Wintermute_VRC Shut up though.
[1:03:39] <+Maids4lyfe> he isn't dead in the past
[1:03:45] <$Tarcanist_> save scum beforehand
[1:03:47] <%Fruitywhompus> did you go into owls mind to fight him
[1:03:48] <$SGrim> @Wintermute_VRC the flow of time is convoluted rooKek
[1:03:49] <%omegasis> well you have to go to Emma first, then proceed to the actual final boss area
[1:03:49] <+TheoTTree> Then Silver Katana starts playing Kappa
[1:03:50] <+TransporterX7> Cause when the kid revived you TIME SHENANAGINS happened
[1:03:52] <+Maids4lyfe> that was just a memory he killed
[1:03:55] <%SrG00SE> BOY this game was fucking close to have a story that made sense
[1:03:59] <Rezroc> @TheoTTree I like the way you think kid, you wanna write a DMC game?
[1:04:07] <Ner234> This time travel shit is wacky but I find myself not caring too much.
[1:04:09] <%lewdskeletor13> This is just a magic memory bullshit thing it seems
[1:04:15] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Emma! Remove my dragon heritage limiter!
[1:04:15] <+TheoTTree> Kappa any time man, any time
[1:04:17] <%collindoucet99> How does DMC5 have a more coherent story than this game?
[1:04:18] <whycans> dad stole some shit
[1:04:21] <%El_Desperad0> tf is the story
[1:04:23] <abakkus> time 2 savescum?
[1:04:26] <+Spenny_YO> A wild Pat appeared. The wild Pat bites brutality. Don‚Äôt feed him don‚Äôt & don‚Äôt fight him. Even if you fight, you can‚Äôt win.
[1:04:34] <whycans> no need until later
[1:04:38] <TheBlankAce> You might want to back the save up again
[1:04:38] <SunsetJack> Make another save back up.
[1:04:45] <+oOZtkOo> oh i didnt know about this, i did the frozen tears one
[1:04:48] <jorgeniev> did he kill
[1:04:50] <+Wintermute_VRC> I think he's been smoking too much divine grass
[1:04:54] <jorgeniev> the snake?
[1:04:56] <%SrG00SE> back up save
[1:04:59] <%Estuko> @Spenny_YO only low attacks will connect, medium/high punches/kicks will auto-miss LUL
[1:05:03] <%tweedler92> frozen is true ending
[1:05:06] <+RobotPancake> save scum

[1:05:21] <%omegasis> yeaaaa
[1:05:22] <garbageheaphound> that would be something
[1:05:22] <%mostundesired> Do it, you won't.
[1:05:26] <meromaromiro> Have fun with that
[1:05:26] <indig0bird> Be agressive Be, be agressive!
[1:05:27] <whycans> you can do three now if you want
[1:05:29] <%omegasis> ooooh man
[1:05:30] <Ted_the_red> the final boss is a doozy
[1:05:30] <Make_me_mad> Frozen tears are the 'true' ending and it sucks, if I remember right.
[1:05:32] <DomunDomunDomun> back that ass up
[1:05:35] <Ornex55> you don't
[1:05:35] <%omegasis> final boss is gonna be a fucking pain in the ass
[1:05:36] <+TransporterX7> Yeah it is....
[1:05:36] <SunsetJack> Not saying anything.
[1:05:37] <SnaKemuho> yeah sure Kappa
[1:05:39] <%Reizie_Etherealm> And he did the same to you so it's fair
[1:05:40] <YourStepdadsBrother> the final boss is ME it was ME THE WHOLE TIME AUSTIN
[1:05:40] <JackalKing> Take my energy, Pat. It comes in the shape of a redbull
[1:05:41] <%waifoong98> sureee
[1:05:43] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat good guess... or not rooKek
[1:05:43] <%sabertoothzombie> don't say anything chat
[1:05:45] <$Tarcanist_> that won't be easy, three times @angriestpat
[1:05:46] <+TheoTTree> Genichiro is Kuze
[1:05:47] <+oOZtkOo> did you find the letter about the mortal blade pat?
[1:05:48] <FiftyFiveP> no one spoil pat
[1:05:48] <+Wintermute_VRC> Yeah dude, it's genichiro. Kappa
[1:05:48] <%lewdskeletor13> IT WAS ME AUSTIN
[1:05:50] <+TheoTTree> Change my mind
[1:05:56] <Dao_Puppy> I'm honestly surprised its not just a giant wolf.
[1:05:56] <+TransporterX7> Also @AngriestPat just stop looking at chat
[1:05:57] <$anime_boyz> its the best move too
[1:05:59] <%alexandrecau> esta el fin genichiro padre
[1:06:04] <+EU_is_Garbage> how is Pat save scumming this?
[1:06:06] <garbageheaphound> whats the move?
[1:06:07] <%SrG00SE> idk what the boss is, but i'm expecting moon presence levels of shit
[1:06:08] <SunsetJack> So do you have to play this game twice to et 100%?
[1:06:10] <%Estuko> @indig0bird EYYYYYYY Brad neely!!
[1:06:11] <+mysterypork> Doesn't one ending require you to side with Owl instead of Kuro?
[1:06:13] <%TheStoneMan12> Judgment cut end locked behind bad ending
[1:06:14] <Hellarussian> whats considered the Bad ending?
[1:06:14] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I want to see the bad boy, bad ending super move now
[1:06:14] <Dakuu75> shouldn't we start with a bad ending then? so it only goes up from here?
[1:06:20] <whycans> there're more secrets but wiki's not done yet
[1:06:22] <%collindoucet99> @mysterypork yeah
[1:06:26] <$D4C_Trice> you fight ginichiro multiple times? good
[1:06:27] <$SGrim> @mysterypork that's the "bad" ending.
[1:06:29] <MonocleCoyote> @AngriestPat if there is dlc is probably gonna continue from the return ending
[1:06:33] <+oOZtkOo> lazulite
[1:06:37] <Dio_TR> @hellarussian Dark souls world
[1:06:40] <SnaKemuho> just go to %appdata% find sekiro and copy the SL file somewhere else

[1:06:48] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Where do you even farm upgrade mats
[1:06:51] <+PrimordialDonut> I'm happy this game doesn't require PVP spells and pyromancies like dark souls to 100%
[1:07:00] <%alexandrecau> kuro is the final boss
[1:07:06] <r_Foeburden87> Dows pat put archive sup on YT ?

[1:07:45] <%Piemen99> crazy talk
[1:07:47] <@commanderclaw> @AngriestPat As usual, Optional bosses are way tougher than the final boss, you'll be fine
[1:07:49] <Dakuu75> looks like Samurai Artifact Armor from FFXI. I love it
[1:07:51] <JackalKing> Its a rock, which is why its a name in Steven Universe. All their names are rocks and minerals
[1:07:52] <garbageheaphound> I wouldn't call hi a bitch
[1:07:53] <%docpepperphd> please be sarcasm
[1:08:10] <+tonyg987> @Townspoon not a true SU fan Kappa

[1:18:09] <%TIME_PUNCHER> YO THAT JUMP
[1:18:10] <Make_me_mad> I don't think Pat's exasperated because fighting Gin is hard, just because it's needlessly dragging out the fight.

[1:29:25] <JackalKing> @Plague_Nurse I dont think they are cheap, but they require a level of dexterity and reaction I am simply not capable of

[1:30:09] <Make_me_mad> To be fair this is a gun he brought with him out of the portal to hell in his grandson's neck. It might be magic.
[1:30:10] <$SGrim> @mostundesired and had a tendency to explode
[1:30:10] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Even revolver need to pull the hammer after each shot as a single action

[1:30:31] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat The only thing that makes this bearable is thattheir posture is low

[1:51:00] <%alexandrecau> Sekiro did NOT live for the moment, he did what he was told and bound by duty
[1:51:01] <SirDogBear> he probably got plenty of guns

[2:15:19] <%Konquerer> don't worry about it
[2:15:20] <+chaumiester> I thought his father threw him in there?
[2:15:20] <%aishman> I think they just threw his body in and thought he was dead.
[2:15:22] <abakkus> bad ninja get put in the shame hole
[2:15:25] <Ner234> Divine Child sounds MUCH older in Japanese. It's odd.
[2:15:25] <%waifoong98> Gyobu voice is the most notable hah
[2:15:25] <oponomo2> sekiro is his name?
[2:15:27] <SunsetJack> He probably got tossed there?
[2:15:27] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat he was in a comma
[2:15:30] <%battlepope99> it's very similar to yakuza in that the setting requires Japanese voices for authenticity I think
[2:15:32] <+Mcmoblin> He was saved by the kid and thrown in the well for safety
[2:15:32] <Dao_Puppy> Don't make fun of him not having a home!
[2:15:33] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Is patches in this game?
[2:15:33] <@Pandora_Prime> Probably just got beat up by soldiers and pushed in
[2:15:34] <%superc37> it sounded on par with other souls game VAs tbh.
[2:15:36] <%lewdskeletor13> Why does any of this shot happen!
[2:15:37] <%ThatGuyfromMars> there should be like, a super hard mode where sekiro doesn't lose his arm, and you don't get all those neat upgrades
[2:15:39] <+Wintermute_VRC> @AngriestPat You're not the least bit frustrated with there being a second mortal blade, and after you defeat isshin, it just GOES AWAY?
[2:15:39] <Nina96> @AngriestPat he was going hollow
[2:15:41] <%phamchri> @AngriestPat im pretty sure it was when "owl" died
[2:15:44] <%redmantic> gotta wait for the Well DLC
[2:15:44] <+Midnight_Fondler> @superc37 Not a weeb the English voice overs just come across as flat and b-quality acting
[2:15:46] <gruff_gridof> MAGIC
[2:15:48] <oponomo2> he lost his arm, so hes not a bad ass
[2:15:48] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Sekiro is the nickname given to him by Isshin the tengu man
[2:15:50] <NotHereToStream> late night at the pub got him there
[2:15:51] <%phamchri> during the past event
[2:15:54] <abakkus> he acquired the Depression skill tree

[2:37:22] <+El_Bucephalus> is this naruto?
[2:37:27] <%Trustworthy290> Trustworthy290 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:37:29] <+MisoPhat_> nice! I'm stuck at the final, guess i gotta catch the vod for the fight
[2:37:32] <oponomo2> This is Sakura Kappa
[2:37:33] <Danger_Beans> So you think we'll ever get a futuristic soulsgame?
[2:37:35] <%El_Desperad0> @ryallen barely any difference
[2:37:39] <+MisoPhat_> I heard NG+ is harder, but not sure how
[2:37:40] <LegendaryDorkKnight> snailkiro snails dont die because they are too afriad to progress LUL
[2:37:41] <InugamiTheHound> doggo no-pat 2019
[2:37:50] <%ArcanumMBD> @Ryallen take more damage, stronger enemies, take more posture damage. You can choose to enable an even harder feature where every attack does chip damage
[2:37:52] <Spiralpower1620> @legendarydorkknight SeemsGood
[2:37:56] <viridianowl> @danger_beans There's The Surge
[2:37:56] <+mastertwin2> Curious to see what replaces the prayer beads
[2:38:01] <%supersugoisenpai1> Wait, do you take damage from not perfect blocks now?
[2:38:11] <+Livingmanwalking> OhMyDog
[2:38:14] <+chaumiester> Anal Beads
[2:38:15] <Ner234> @supersugoisenpai1 Yes
[2:38:15] <%Lion_kun> did apt beat the game?
[2:38:18] <Nina96> new game + seems not seem that different
[2:38:20] <cowardlord> Money
[2:38:20] <%Lion_kun> how many trie did it take him?
[2:38:21] <majindusto> Patrick Boiven of the Salty Boiven Clan
[2:38:22] <%nicoleymcquack> I was gonna go to bed after you beat the game but here I am again at 3am on a school night watching you play new game +
[2:38:23] <%Trustworthy290> How's it going?
[2:38:28] <+Mcmoblin> NG+ speedrun template?
[2:38:34] <Caidezes> New Game Plus seems pointless in this game.
[2:38:36] <%ArcanumMBD> @supersugoisenpai1 if you choose to face additional hardships you do. You can give the charm to Kuro or hte Sculptor to remove that
[2:38:38] <%king_wragles> So why was there salt before?
[2:38:41] <%mostundesired> Big Juiced
[2:38:42] <%Gogogolem> I bet its lapiz lazuli
[2:38:42] <SunsetJack> You are building posture like mad now.
[2:38:45] <CurrySauseBandit> He does, since he gave up Kuro's charm.
[2:38:45] <%SuttonIsTrash> SuttonIsTrash subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:38:47] <%king_wragles> I came in right after the thing happened
[2:38:57] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat It's because you gave the charm back. If you take it back then you wont take chip damage
[2:38:57] <+Wintermute_VRC> That's... actually kind of brutal
[2:39:02] <Nina96> @Caidezes new game + is kinda pointless in all of them
[2:39:03] <+mastertwin2> God damn
[2:39:04] <abakkus> its bc of the charm
[2:39:04] <mechslayer71> @caidezes Seems about as worthwhile as any of the others in the series LUL
[2:39:05] <%Roasted_Pheasant> That's cause of charm
[2:39:10] <oponomo2> You are a Charm, pat.
[2:39:11] <silverglove2012> I came back in time
[2:39:13] <%Roasted_Pheasant> You CHOSE to suffer

[2:39:22] <jubejube56> hense the suffering
[2:39:37] <%Konquerer> @Lion_kun infinite because he lost
[2:39:45] <%camodikk> he got isshin in like 20 mins
[2:39:46] <+mastertwin2> We nG+ now boys
[2:39:52] <%Gogogolem> quick set him on fire
[2:39:54] <%Lion_kun> nice

[2:39:56] <Nina96> gezz that chip...
[2:40:00] <CriticKitten> OOF
[2:40:01] <+Mcmoblin> Wow he doesn't not take posture
[2:40:03] <Caidezes> @mechslayer71 Eh. In DS/2/3 NG+ at least you get better items.

[2:41:10] <LegendaryDorkKnight> MercyWing1 DxCat MercyWing2
[2:41:14] <Caidezes> @Plague_Nurse DS3 has better stuff in NG+ too.
[2:41:15] <InugamiTheHound> big damage!
[2:41:27] <oponomo2> Are you saying this game is well made?
[2:41:33] <mechslayer71> @caidezes I‚Äôm gonna go through it cuz his game has the best combat and fights in the series, I don‚Äôt care about the items tbh
[2:41:39] <CriticKitten> Ouch
[2:41:52] <kiryuva> valeComfy
[2:42:07] <Nina96> is thier gonna be a mini death count?
[2:42:30] <abakkus> then pewish
[2:42:38] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> This guy is a beast
[2:42:39] <zebult> this is playthrough number 2?
[2:42:40] <+Edible_Enthusiasm> no need to spread the dragonrot right away
[2:42:43] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> Lessgo pat. No death run!
[2:42:48] <%Reaped_Psyche> Just watched your first stream of this, then started it myself. Good to see you getting so comfortable in the mechanics.
[2:42:51] <Nina96> @zebult yes
[2:43:04] <zebult> @Nina96 is it just for fun or is there a goal in mind?
[2:43:20] <+tigerkneetv> Is this new game plus?
[2:43:23] <Nina96> @zebult just to see whats new
[2:43:32] <%SrG00SE> OWL2019PAR
[2:43:36] <%nicoleymcquack> I've seen a lot of people hate on this game but personally I cant wait to play it, it looks super fun and the added ninja jumps make it almost a game changer for souls games
[2:43:36] <%Roasted_Pheasant> That's a big cock
[2:43:43] <Nina96> @tigerkneetv yes
[2:44:06] <Nina96> @AngriestPat also no beeds
[2:44:19] <cowardlord> Did pat beat the demon of hatred?
[2:44:26] <Nina96> u never know
[2:44:26] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Yes he did
[2:44:30] <bashful_bard> What's the charm do?
[2:44:36] <+Edible_Enthusiasm> Chkn
[2:44:43] <oponomo2> damn pat, you slay cocks like you were born knowing how to deal with them Kappa
[2:44:56] <%Reaped_Psyche> I can't wait to see what Happy Hob and Lobos Jr. do with this game.
[2:44:58] <i_worship_his_shadow> every game should have a die in 1 hit mode
[2:45:01] <%Gogogolem> you're an orphan you might be her son
[2:45:01] <%Roasted_Pheasant> @AngriestPat never say something's impossible. people will ALWAYS be nuts enough to do ANYTHING.
[2:45:08] <%aishman> Oh you didn't switch back to Japanese @AngriestPat ?
[2:45:13] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Is Pat actually going to do a second playthrough on stream?
[2:45:17] <CurrySauseBandit> @bashful_bard Keeping the charem makes it so you don't take chip damage on blocks. Giving it away makes all non-perfect guarded attack deal chip.
[2:45:18] <%Teintstein> missed the gold in the old lady's basement
[2:45:18] <+j_feezyy> Hey chat what's kuro's charm do?
[2:45:24] <+Spenny_YO> @angriestpat you know there‚Äôs hidden items under the old lady‚Äôs house, right?
[2:45:24] <Nina96> @bashful_bard adds chip damage for not perfect blocks
[2:45:25] <+Mcmoblin> NICE

[2:45:43] <+Mcmoblin> Divine confetti at the beginning?! that makes SENSE
[2:45:48] <oponomo2> what happens if u jump that cliff on NG+? lets find out Kappa
[2:45:50] <redsynod> So it's good?
[2:45:57] <jubejube56> thief
[2:46:06] <%luckysteak> money can buy you many peanuts
[2:46:09] <LegendaryDorkKnight> hookers and coke?
[2:46:10] <+MisoPhat_> i wonder how long it will take for someone complete a no hit run on this game
[2:46:14] <$GoogleyGareth> Just joined, take it this is new game +?
[2:46:16] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat you are overblowing the importance of confetti. It's an optional buff. You have other ways of dealing with Headless, including raw sword to just deal posture damage
[2:46:26] <%supersugoisenpai1> stealth
[2:46:26] <%SrG00SE> wait can you still use the mortal blade
[2:46:35] <oponomo2> Try a blunt weapon this run Kappa
[2:46:42] <ZComiX> did pat get all the endings?
[2:46:48] <%El_Desperad0> yes
[2:46:53] <ZComiX> nice
[2:46:53] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Do the ghost bosses drop new stuff now too?

[2:47:06] <LegendaryDorkKnight> enemies really dont want to fall off cliffs
[2:47:06] <%Teintstein> did he ever do the evil ending?
[2:47:13] <%tizz86> missed the notification guess I'll catch the vod, 'night all
[2:47:18] <%supersugoisenpai1> Wonder if some mad man will figure out a way to beat this game without guarding
[2:47:26] <Nina96> @Teintstein not on stream
[2:47:27] <%ArcanumMBD> Every unique drop in the game is replaced with money or a jizo statue
[2:47:29] <SunsetJack> He will do the evil ending on this run probably.
[2:47:34] <%SrG00SE> oh cool you can totally use the mortal draw without having hte mortal blade
[2:47:36] <%nameless_majin> Pat my mom said you seen to stop cursing
[2:47:37] <%SrG00SE> thats sick
[2:47:56] <+Reizie_Etherealm> What does the jizo statue do?

[2:49:13] <%king_wragles> I don't understand, how does it give you an extra rez?
[2:49:15] <+MisoPhat_> @AngriestPat what would you say was the hardest boss in the game
[2:49:20] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat apparently you can also stay on the ground a lot longer with the pill for those surprise attacks off of revives

[2:59:41] <garbageheaphound> you probably could have beat Genichiro if you didnt
[2:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:52] <Supabait> is there a trophy for doing a playthough without the charm?
[3:00:16] <FiftyFiveP> @AngriestPat you can get a deathblow on this guy by running upto him before he breaks out
[3:00:17] <LegendaryDorkKnight> oh yeah LUL
[3:00:18] <$Tarcanist_> does this buy feel tougber in ng+ than ng? @angriestpat
[3:00:20] <Nina96> damn

[3:00:59] <%barkon345> what c harm did he get rid of?
[3:01:07] <MonocleCoyote> @AngriestPat whats the combat art you get from beating ishinn?
[3:01:17] <oponomo2> why do people call the first run Next Game(NG)?
[3:01:19] <r_Foeburden87> You streaming Stormbringers launch tho right ?
[3:01:22] <sukiyakiwestern> kuro's charm + demon bell is hell

[3:01:45] <Supabait> Kappa
[3:01:48] <%MagickBurritoh> Judgement NUT
[3:01:52] <LegendaryDorkKnight> judgement nut erewhere
[3:01:52] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> STORM RULER
[3:01:53] <%Mythicalbrit> so what do you think is the best combat arts?
[3:01:56] <%Rellim80> NG is New Game. Is NG+ is...
[3:01:59] <oponomo2> Stop hugging a wall, pat.
[3:02:09] <%SrG00SE> that last line is mick btw
[3:02:17] <%docpepperphd> Final verdict on the game?
[3:02:25] <sukiyakiwestern> the saint sword combat art is really good at denying perilous attacks
[3:02:30] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Warframe Stream?
[3:02:31] <%SrG00SE> the confident guy who thinks sekiro lost the will to live = ricepirate
[3:02:31] <%galaxyswirl> how many bosses are ending locked?
[3:02:40] <Saltmeisterr> ok im out
[3:02:42] <+Mcmoblin> Can DLC make this game an A+ ?
[3:02:43] <%NWR_James> eyyy
[3:02:47] <+MisoPhat_> but is there an S rank?
[3:02:48] <Saltmeisterr> peace out
[3:02:52] <LegendaryDorkKnight> good ole days of Xplay
[3:02:53] <%fragdar> why did he reset the ng+?
[3:02:59] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I can agree with that
[3:03:10] <%lloyddboy> remember when adam wasn't crazy
[3:03:15] <Saltmeisterr> seeya chat
[3:03:15] <$rytyoung> Do you get more prayer beads in Ng+ or is there a cap?
[3:03:18] <+HeadsHeldHigh> 100 point scale is useless
[3:03:20] <%Rellim80> 6pts?
[3:03:22] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> I super agree. No one uses anything below 5 in the 10 rating system.
[3:03:23] <LegendaryDorkKnight> remember Morgan Webb?
[3:03:25] <Storm_Samurai> LUL
[3:03:29] <+Mcmoblin> "This game is a game changer"
[3:03:30] <Caidezes> lewd
[3:03:34] <oponomo2> i'm more of a sausage guy, rather than balls. so i give it my sausage to please.
[3:03:41] <%docpepperphd> lol will do
[3:03:46] <%PlainSimpleTailor> We need an Infographic that exactly quotes you on this, Pat
[3:03:50] <Nina96> this games yours or paige?
[3:03:51] <+Reizie_Etherealm> So you'd give this game a 5 or a 4?
[3:03:52] <%barkon345> though I dont think the difficulty will be fore everyone
[3:04:07] <%Dr_DangerPhD> for a game to be a 5 it pretty much has to be a generation defining game
[3:04:10] <+Blackgaver> this the new souls game?
[3:04:12] <%fragdar> yo @AngriestPat why did you reseted the ng+?
[3:04:14] <squirtkitten> @barkon345 yeah not everyone likes artificial difficulty
[3:04:18] <%Rellim80> What charm?
[3:04:19] <%ArcanumMBD> @AngriestPat Enemies still deal a bit more damage, and more posture damage. This becomes very evident on bosses
[3:04:23] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Not Souls
[3:04:25] <LegendaryDorkKnight> its gotta be a re4 for a 5 star
[3:04:29] <Cymen90> Is this NG+?
[3:04:33] <oponomo2> why you getting hit pat? why you hurting yourself?
[3:04:40] <%El_Desperad0> @squirtkitten apatBig agree
[3:04:41] <+El_Bucephalus> Nothis is Patrick
[3:04:44] <+Swaggamanca> He wouldn't have ten gourds if it wasnt
[3:04:59] <Supabait> the divine dragon uses that move too right?
[3:04:59] <$rytyoung> @angriestpat Does that mean there is a cap on memories too?
[3:05:00] <+StrawberryPantsu> WHAO
[3:05:08] <+StrawberryPantsu> THIS GAME LOOKS PRETTY ON pc
[3:05:09] <squirtkitten> @Plague_Nurse if they lowered the damage output from one shots to regular Souls level the game would be fine, just with a tougher combat system
[3:05:27] <%Big_Dream> high monk
[3:05:35] <%Big_Dream> high monk is great
[3:05:39] <@Pandora_Prime> sick kicks for the ladies
[3:05:42] <oponomo2> are you high, monk?
[3:05:42] <LegendaryDorkKnight> it's the tatsu
[3:05:46] <Parapattern> Oh, hi monk!
[3:05:48] <furonultimate626> high monk never seems to be effective
[3:05:49] <+DrPoxx> is this new game plus?
[3:05:57] <oponomo2> @Parapattern perfect
[3:06:00] <%Big_Dream> no its new game plu plus
[3:06:12] <%Rellim80> What charm did he have that he got rid of?
[3:06:18] <LegendaryDorkKnight> lap pies
[3:06:44] <JoXul> whens the pat + woolie LP
[3:06:45] <Nina96> thats fine
[3:06:50] <@Pandora_Prime> Sometimes you just wanna cut a bitch.
[3:06:55] <+Ticking_> pats going game journalist mode
[3:06:55] <cowardlord> I understand that
[3:07:07] <+DrPoxx> I love it when games let me feel powerful
[3:07:12] <squirtkitten> can you get through this without being a perfect parry boss? Cuz my brain is bad and i have vision issues so i cant parry perfect but still want to play and finish this
[3:07:13] <$SGrim> @JoXul may I recommend multi-twitch?
[3:07:14] <$deadlypartition> cheer300 hey pat just wanted to let you know that I just insta died 3 times on the 3rd phase of the last boss cus I was using bite downs instead of the gourd
[3:07:18] <+RowenCleric> can this game actually even get harder...
[3:07:25] <%bevyrage> yes
[3:07:30] <DracaenaLeaf> RESET
[3:07:30] <LegendaryDorkKnight> you should be able to slap him with your wet noodle now
[3:07:32] <+Reizie_Etherealm> I wish you luck on the path to the evil ending, I'm looking forward to the judgement cut move
[3:07:32] <oponomo2> You would like a game called Obscure Spirits, or something like that. Kappa
[3:07:34] <ketchuo13> Is this new game plus
[3:07:38] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> chip dmg
[3:07:40] <JoXul> @SGrim Ha thats a good idea
[3:07:48] <%bevyrage> there are two variables you can activate to make the game harder and they're pretty easy to obtain right away
[3:07:50] <%Mythicalbrit> wow high monk seems really good vs sweeps
[3:08:17] <$rytyoung> so will you get a secret ending saying the world is saved the after this?
[3:08:18] <+Mcmoblin> He is being a weak version of himself
[3:08:21] <Supabait> he's not using his bow at all
[3:08:32] <LegendaryDorkKnight> gets stabbed in the throat "I'm fine"
[3:08:33] <Supabait> welp shit
[3:08:40] <Caidezes> He's doing a lot less damage.
[3:08:46] <%MagickBurritoh> So Pat's playing easy mode huh?
[3:08:46] <+Mcmoblin> Oh there it is
[3:08:50] <%bevyrage> oh shit just realized that pat is going for the canon result of this fight
[3:08:52] <%SrG00SE> before that would have broke your posture
[3:08:53] <sukiyakiwestern> so true ng+ is just completely optional
[3:09:04] <+Reizie_Etherealm> SICK KICKS
[3:09:06] <FiftyFiveP> really lucky charm
[3:09:10] <oponomo2> Calamity charm

[3:09:40] <LegendaryDorkKnight> Canon
[3:09:41] <reonome> LAME
[3:09:42] <DatAsuna> but the future refused to change
[3:09:42] <Cypher_Ranger_PhazON> For real tho. Who fukn threw that shuriken!?
[3:09:43] <%ThatGuyfromMars> he's a sore loser
[3:09:43] <Parapattern> YOU DIDN'T WIN
[3:09:44] <%flying_hipp0> wow what a coward
[3:09:44] <$cureneckbeard> you did it.

[3:09:56] <$rytyoung> but you lose your prosthetic for a real arm just to get it chopped off again??
[3:09:58] <Nina96> U STILL LAME THOUGH
[3:09:59] <oponomo2> "My prosthetic! I swear i'll get another one!"
[3:10:12] <LegendaryDorkKnight> I'll slap u later bowman
[3:10:14] <%Kirijuo> Worf would fucking hate that guy
[3:10:20] <+Mcmoblin> I like to think Miyazaki threw that because you cheated
[3:10:24] <DracaenaLeaf> oh that was a reset
[3:10:26] <%GarbageNirvana> So you don't even get a bonus item or anything for winning that fight?
[3:10:26] <$cureneckbeard> "You cut off my arm! Now I have to go tie it back on"
[3:10:27] <Nina96> just call it now
[3:10:41] <42nfl19> omg this is like for honor, you are having a nice 1v1 and then some asshole has to but in
[3:10:42] <%El_Desperad0> replay value is very low
[3:10:45] <squirtkitten> !uptime
[3:10:45] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 10m.
[3:10:46] <+DrPoxx> There really should be something, even if it is only a large sen starting amount
[3:10:54] <oponomo2> I'm real BibleThump
[3:11:18] <+Mcmoblin> I sorta like DMC5's results if you beat virgil at the beginning of the game
[3:11:19] <aliceinsomeland> we ng+ or something? just got here
[3:11:21] <+StrawberryPantsu> Maaaaaan
[3:11:21] <@commanderclaw> Well, there is the demon bell, that does something similar
[3:11:22] <%Fenlig> DMC 5 or Sekiro?
[3:11:28] <+StrawberryPantsu> I could re buy this on PC
[3:11:37] <+StrawberryPantsu> DMC5 for me personally
[3:11:38] <reiju_22> dmc5
[3:11:40] <Supabait> is the ashina cross any good?
[3:11:41] <%GarbageNirvana> @Fenlig DMC 5 unless you really, REALLY like From Soft games
[3:11:59] <+DrPoxx> So wait what does the charm do?
[3:12:00] <%ArcanumMBD> Demon Bell doesnt even affect skill point gain :/
[3:12:00] <LegendaryDorkKnight> steam sale get both
[3:12:10] <%lloyddboy> On the bright side, you could brag you almost beat Hard Mode Genichiro first try
[3:12:16] <+chaumiester> Both
[3:12:29] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat how come levels that you unlock in devil hunter mode in dmc5 dont also unlock their human mode difficulty?
[3:12:34] <%SrG00SE> bloody palace is not even out yet
[3:12:43] <+Reizie_Etherealm> "Once you've tasted enough blood, you will develop a hunger for it"
[3:12:45] <+StrawberryPantsu> Buy Nioh
[3:12:49] <+chaumiester> So... Both
[3:12:50] <+StrawberryPantsu> Kappa
[3:12:57] <+StrawberryPantsu> Eventually both yes
[3:12:57] <%blastazoid26> They're hard to compare. DMC5 has more bang for your buck.
[3:13:01] <squirtkitten> its a good thing this game is fantasy based, otherwise the first clash of katanas both would break instantly
[3:13:03] <LegendaryDorkKnight> buy might number 9 Kappa
[3:13:04] <%SrG00SE> im a fucking shinobi lover and love all of FromS' work but the answer is DMC5
[3:13:05] <Caidezes> DMC5 on DMD mode is harder than Sekiro.
[3:13:06] <%nicoleymcquack> happy 3.30am, I gotta sleep, night chat and pat <3
[3:13:12] <bracketmanps> have boss fights happened already?
[3:13:23] <%lloyddboy> @blastazoid26 more BANG BANG BANG, you could say
[3:13:25] <mikesapartment> bye doggie
[3:13:25] <+DingusMcFadden> I'm too much a noob to really enjoy the gameplay of DMC5
[3:13:28] <Supabait> does sekiro have live-action cutscenes though???
[3:13:29] <aliceinsomeland> This game is get good or suffer
[3:13:31] <+DingusMcFadden> I jsut end up button mashing
[3:13:34] <oponomo2> I'm no human! i'm a virgin! i can take hard games!
[3:13:34] <%SrG00SE> bang bang for your buck
[3:13:46] <LegendaryDorkKnight> it's almost like fighting trained enemies
[3:13:53] <%GarbageNirvana> @DingusMcFadden I glorb'd my way through the last few missions and still had a blast
[3:13:54] <+DingusMcFadden> Agreed, @oponomo2
[3:13:58] <$D4C_Trice> New game +?
[3:13:59] <SoFarFetched> being sekiro is suffering.
[3:14:11] <%blastazoid26> I think i have played more DMC5 than RE2
[3:14:12] <%SrG00SE> last year did you think you'd be comparing DMC5 to Sekiro AT ALL?!?! @AngriestPat EXPECTATIONS = SURPASSED
[3:14:13] <%amilie3> dmc is both easier and harder
[3:14:17] <@Pandora_Prime> Take a hit and see how bad it is
[3:14:20] <+Reizie_Etherealm> You're not good at parrying? BOI YOU'RE GONNA LEARN TODAY
[3:14:23] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@StrawberryPantsu) (warning)
[3:14:23] <WoolieVersus> 197 raiders from WoolieVersus have joined! 
[3:14:24] <squirtkitten> dont buy this if you dont like artifical difficulty
[3:14:26] <%Fenlig> Whats the charm do?
[3:14:32] <%lloyddboy> WOOLIE
[3:14:33] <SoFarFetched> HERE COMES THE RAID
[3:14:33] <LVDoomien> raid inbound

[3:14:37] <%Dr00_PhD> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[3:14:39] <+DingusMcFadden> It just doesn't feel satisfying to me, @GarbageNirvana . I don't feel like a cool badass
[3:14:39] <%amilie3> woolie
[3:14:39] <Ner234> @squirtkitten Artificial?
[3:14:40] <Basch71> you play dmc5 if you wanna do combo, you play sekiro if you wanna die
[3:14:41] <coldnoid> the cries of baby jesus are here
[3:14:42] <blackbookalpha> Woolie Mob invaded
[3:14:47] <KNEEGOOSE> WOOLIE INBOUND
[3:14:47] <+StrawberryPantsu> Man I want this game on PC

[3:14:56] <%wsintai> apatDab
[3:14:56] <$KnivesEve> if i enjoy the suffering of playing ninja gaiden games, then i could potentially enjoy this?

[3:15:04] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat now you have to keep playing rooH
[3:15:04] <Supabait> woolie pat is about to go offline BibleThump
[3:15:05] <%bevyrage> that means he's gotta stay up for like an hour longer
[3:15:05] <LegendaryDorkKnight> not artificial difficulties at qll
[3:15:10] <BottleBlast> I've heard from some people about how half the fights are exciting and others are just a chore, I haven't really run into any boss fights yet that have put me to sleep, usually the opposite.
[3:15:11] <squirtkitten> @Ner234 the description of artifical difficulty is infalted enemy damage and health, not smarter AI. The AI in this is dumb as shit but often one shots you and has high health, ergo artificial
[3:15:12] <%bevyrage> THEM'S THE RULES!
[3:15:15] <+jimmyjams1688> Kite Ninja Dunked Woolie HARD
[3:15:15] <%SrG00SE> @KnivesEve this game is closer to ninja gaiden then dark souls so yeah
[3:15:16] <SkreamnR3dSkull> Aaayyy Pat HeyGuys
[3:15:19] <%nmaten> this NG+?
[3:15:22] <%Eclipse_knight_> woolies revenge for last time
[3:15:23] <%GarbageNirvana> @DingusMcFadden I getcha, same thing makes it hard for me to get into certain fighting games
[3:15:29] <NeroInfinite> Implying pat wouldn't do another 10 hour stream.
[3:15:29] <%Kirijuo> Raided just o end stream LUL
