[0:08:52] <$FlubbedPig> cheer200 Anime recommendation for silly reasons. You guys should watch Wotakoi, a romance series about office-worker nerds dating. Reason I recommend is 'cause one of the couples is just you guys. They fight and bicker in public so bad you think they're about to beat each other, but in private they're really low tempo and loving. The other couple plays Monster Hunter and the girl bitches about Kushala Daora drops.

[0:45:27] <FlubbedPig> cheer200 Fate was originally a visual novel. It has since become a MASSIVE PROPERTY with a billion titles in every medium. Basic premise is 7 mages summon historical/mythological figures to fight a proxy war over a single wish. Fate’s complicated to get into, but there is one anime that's good on it's own without worrying about any of that shit: Fate/Zero. It's quite fantastic and requires no previous knowledge until maybe the last 10 minutes.
[0:45:31] <MyDarkStorm> ? what you should have made it
[0:45:32] <+Jimboq> some people like the taste pat

Another good series they make is Kara no Kyoukai (or Garden of Sinners), which is like, 12 anime movies. They're great but the story-telling's odd at times and the movies are out of order.

Fate/grand order is the newest mobile game that has made around $2 billion and is huge in Japan. It’s historical figures fighting for the holy grail in a battle Royale. Please ask Woolie to play fate/unlimited codes. That game is rad!

[0:56:43] <element_of_loyalty> Pat is crashing Peach's brain

[0:56:54] <Worldbrand> pat's right, people usually take "ambivalence" for not caring, but it really means that you're really strongly in one of two ways

[0:57:23] <RagnarokAM> Ambivelence means to aspire for two different ideal
[0:57:23] <$ComfortableStranger> ambilvilant means you could go either way
[0:57:23] <+gael_jebidibah> Pat is correct
[0:57:23] <ryu1299> pat is actually right

[0:57:40] <$Chimeraelite> Paige you're thinking Apathy @AngriestPat
[0:57:44] <+SeroSedLaeto> Ambi like Ambidexterous, Valent like atom valences. Moving rapidly between two separate responses.

[0:57:50] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Google to the rescue
[0:57:51] <%jermulr> Crazy talk doesn't work anymore cause pat is aware of it. Now when he's wrong it's because he's shitty.
[0:57:52] <%Kay_Tana> Fancy apathy then
[0:57:53] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> ambidextrous, amphitheater, amphibious - ambi or amphi means both/two
[0:57:53] <+angel949> like apathy syndrome from p3

[1:11:34] <+tigerfang86> it's ok
[1:11:34] <%WingBuffet> the environments seemed pretty cool
[1:11:36] <DiscountChicken> F
[1:11:37] <+tigerfang86> BUT BANG BANG BANG
[1:11:37] <GUNxSPECTRE> God, Donte's Ivory and Ebony are hideous
[1:11:37] <+FOGSHIE> Never came to PC for no reason

[1:11:42] <Kataguro> Fuck You
[1:11:45] <%knomad2b> i can't stand how dmc handles weapons, the control scheme feels uncomfortable
[1:11:45] <+abadbadman> HEY REMEMBER WHEN THEY RIPPED BLEACH for the DLC
[1:11:47] <%DamnKrazy> Fuck you
[1:11:48] <%SSaryn> "Fuck you"
[1:11:48] <helpmeimafruit> I've got a bigger dick
[1:11:49] <element_of_loyalty> ONION MAN
[1:11:49] <NeetKiller> Its alright but the cutscenes yeah
[1:11:51] <CactusChef3> VERGIMOBILE
[1:11:52] <ryu1299> play it in Spanish the cutscenes are great
[1:11:52] <+patriotrenegade> BANG BANG BANG
[1:11:52] <Mottyrob> Alex Jones
[1:11:56] <Kataguro> Vergilmobile
[1:11:56] <+abadbadman> REMEMBER HOLLOW VIRGIL
[1:11:57] <%WingBuffet> snake nerd
[1:11:57] <Schramjet> I actually love that scene
[1:11:58] <KaiserRolled> Is it as bad as that cringey lady form the new dmc footage
[1:12:00] <mercado94> Pull my Fuck You Trigger
[1:12:00] <+Grayhammatter> Haylo snekman
[1:12:00] <KatabolicRage> But pat, the cutscenes become great if you set the language to spanish and install the SENOR DONTE mod
[1:12:01] <admiral_of_crunch> "And I've got a bigger dick"
[1:12:02] <Medo3G> but el donte tho
[1:12:03] <AlasterAngelo> SSSHAKESPEAREAN
[1:12:04] <cherubsanonymous> Literally everything about it is embarrassing fuck DmC
[1:12:04] <$Jazzarms> donte was the best thing to come out of DMC
[1:12:05] <element_of_loyalty> wakey wakey
[1:12:06] <%Remery_> Snek men :)
[1:12:06] <%Fenrirlives> DmC's story is only bearable in SPANISH
[1:12:09] <+tigerfang86> D O N T E
[1:12:11] <@PlagueOfGripes> if you two hand a hammer they break poise on every hit
[1:12:12] <Gregorhasjoined> Hmmmm
[1:12:12] <yosukecchi> snakes in real life don't have hit stun
[1:12:15] <CatmanIX> guy-st
[1:12:16] <@Mechz71> Soy Donte el extermidor de diemones!
[1:12:18] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> "And I've got a bigger dick" is the only decent line in that game.
[1:12:19] <GUNxSPECTRE> Despacito May Cry
[1:12:19] <AlasterAngelo> FORNICATE THOU
[1:12:19] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> not in a million years

[1:12:23] <+patriotrenegade> They do, you just need a bigger weapon
[1:12:33] <element_of_loyalty> Never kick a sleepy man
[1:12:38] <Huntercd> Demon's great hammer is great
[1:12:38] <%ECRead> when you become a snek, you negate hitstun
[1:12:40] <%Ssaik> DmC feels like a game that doesn't need to exist; does everything that DMC does worse and is just a blemish on the series
[1:12:42] <$wolfofsound> "Yknow what I mean"
[1:12:42] <+Noni321> Dark Souls had a story? You ask

[1:13:29] <$b0neh34d> cheer350 Hey Pat and Paige! I love it when i actually catch both of your streams!
[1:13:30] <Prism_Wing> Controversial statement: Most lines from all Devil May Cry games are cringey. Let's not forget about "filling your dark soul with LIIIIIGHT!"
[1:13:30] <%WingBuffet> Hawks is the dirtiest hero boy
[1:13:32] <KaiserRolled> Full countdown vampires lp when
[1:13:32] <@WoolyFish> Finally they are doing Katawa Shoujo

[1:13:53] <%khalcipher> *MY HERO ACADEMIA SPOILER*
[1:13:54] <KoyaMusa> the best tip is to watch plague's streams
[1:13:55] <leinadtonu> SAVESCUM
[1:13:56] <Kilagn> Yeah okay but Pat, Chaos Legion when? I just thought about the game the other day and then saw you retweey something about it.
[1:13:56] <zenwebley> xcom bb

[1:14:05] <%ECRead> the correct answer is savescum
[1:14:07] <@PlagueOfGripes> pat is bad at xcom
[1:14:09] <AlasterAngelo> in Xcom 2 you have to be aggressive because of all the fucking timers
[1:14:12] <GUNxSPECTRE> Cover in XCOM IS FOR COWARDS
[1:14:13] <whimsicallifestyle> @Guardiansaiyan theyre recording detroit tomorrow, plan to be uploaded thursday

[1:14:21] <KoyaMusa> thank you eli
[1:14:21] <+arcadeking48> The biggest tip for XCOM is to ask PlagueofGripes for tips. Cause he did a stream like 2 years ago and did really well]

[2:16:18] <crimsonharvest> Lasik isnt scary its totally boring and frustrating just like a dentist or lawyer's office
[2:16:18] <+telomere1> yes you can
[2:16:20] <$nademonkey1100> pat that guy is still floating
[2:16:21] <%Keyd00d> You can,
[2:16:21] <%ECRead> yeah
[2:16:21] <+10001110100> Smells like burning hair
[2:16:21] <%goose_attack_almanac> "What's this I hear about guessing your prescription on the internet"
[2:16:22] <tacostarvedbeast> It’s not scary your scary!
[2:16:22] <Katorskay> Pat no you can't that's just the smell of the gas of the machine
[2:16:23] <+D33TR> It's super worth it.
[2:16:23] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Lasik totally undersold the long-term side-effects of the procedure, which can be debilitating later in life.
[2:16:24] <$Smolkupo> Amazing
[2:16:25] <+PiCheese> DansGame
[2:16:26] <+telomere1> smells like burning hair
[2:16:27] <+zaworldo> Yup
[2:16:28] <%Keyd00d> Pat is right
[2:16:28] <element_of_loyalty> smeel the smell
[2:16:29] <Katorskay> i had it done 4 months ago
[2:16:29] <+cvp5127> paige broken
[2:16:30] <%Remery_> You can smell your burning flesh
[2:16:30] <@thenefftw> please stop
[2:16:30] <@PlagueOfGripes> also they just scream into your ear when you aren't paying attention
[2:16:30] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Paige i wouldn't it was an awful experience.
[2:16:31] <Ell1ot> i have a VHS of my brother getting that done. It's gnarly
[2:16:31] <Everpresent_Overseer> Just aim like 20 green light laser pointers at your eyes
[2:16:32] <+zaworldo> mm
[2:16:33] <+NickyDynamite> I've heard that
[2:16:34] <element_of_loyalty> iris
[2:16:37] <CatmanIX> paige, what do you think lasik does?
[2:16:38] <+frontlinecaster> You can't be asleep because your eyes move around when you sleep
[2:16:38] <%SaltyDongs> what is the risk of Lasik
[2:16:40] <+SirTerribleh> They have other ways besides a laser
[2:16:40] <%GameOverDeo> you need to be awake
[2:16:40] <+Picabunny> My dad got lasik and it improved his vision to the point he didn't need glasses for 15 years.
[2:16:40] <$Piemono> Paige would probably come out of that blind
[2:16:41] <%Keyd00d> It doesn't hurt
[2:16:42] <element_of_loyalty> :D
[2:16:43] <Jman409> Eyes move to much while you sleep
[2:16:43] <illsian> Get in the dead space 2 machine
[2:16:43] <+SenorCounter> Don't move your eye for like 5mins
[2:16:45] <+micalica> what the fuck I can go blind if I look somewhere else?!
[2:16:46] <+HyperCharge_Sam> that sounds scary
[2:16:48] <%Bustamente> I hear that your night vision becomes worse as a result but your regular vision is better @AngriestPat
[2:16:49] <@thenefftw> dear god, please stop
[2:16:53] <JJMR322> yep. you see everything paige
[2:16:54] <+Jimboq> pat is talking out oif his ass right now
[2:16:56] <Ell1ot> nope! they just pour numbing drops in your eye
[2:16:56] <+Orion1189> They also have to cut your cornea with a scalpel first.
[2:16:56] <element_of_loyalty> mean
[2:16:58] <ALIN135> Pat is rong ofcourse he is
[2:17:01] <+SirTerribleh> there's different methods
[2:17:01] <DracaenaLeaf> CAGE key
[2:17:02] <Katorskay> @AngriestPat That's bullshit I had it done 4 months ago, that's just the smell of the gas used for the machine
[2:17:03] <%Keyd00d> @AngriestPat There's no pain, just a light tapping sensation
[2:17:04] <Megalon7> REM would prevent it
[2:17:07] <JJMR322> have you seen final destination?
[2:17:07] <Worldbrand> ^

[2:24:30] <%Keyd00d> did dark souls invent this type of castle
[2:24:33] <DaBigVitus> the classic "what's the difference between an homage and a rip off"
[2:24:33] <+Grayhammatter> Damn

[2:25:15] <element_of_loyalty> BABE
[2:25:15] <Worldbrand> fate was an eroge and they dialed that back right after it got super popular
[2:25:21] <%konodi0da> its super porn
[2:25:21] <zaptar13> I thought Fate was porn
[2:25:23] <Kataguro> >Starting with ZeroI don't like it
[2:25:24] <+Zaver88> Also it was Hentai.
[2:25:25] <%Caidezes> The only Fate stuff worth experiencing is the Ufotable adaptations.
[2:25:27] <%Svanyr> REEEEEEEEE ZERO
[2:25:27] <+HanPaul> fate atpClaire
[2:25:30] <%Gogogolem> basically fight over the dragon balls
[2:25:32] <+thesw1tch> that fate shit was a gamefaqs post
[2:25:33] <glass_marcus> Fate is boring
[2:25:34] <+AntithesisEK> except for the fact that Zero is a prequel that uses elements of all three routes of Fate/Stay Night
[2:25:38] <%konodi0da> the big porn
[2:25:38] <Liwyn> Fate is the people die when they are killed meme
[2:25:38] <%CyborgAV> Fate/Zero is an AWFUL place to start

[2:25:43] <+cvp5127> fate started of as porn tho
[2:25:44] <+baseball7000> It has like a handful of porn scenes in a visual novel over a million words long.
[2:25:45] <+phatmac16> Fate is good
[2:25:46] <Ted_the_red> Fate started out as porn because no one would have looked at it anyways
[2:25:49] <+joylent_blue> thats fine

[2:25:58] <%TheSniperJoe> cheer500 During my wisdom teeth operation I had to have all four removed. They were all impacted and three were partially fused to the bone of my jaw.

[3:11:47] <+genowyn> Zouken's goal isn't the most fucked up thing (though other mages would get pissed he would use the grail for that instead of getting at dat root) it's just his methods are evil

[3:19:05] <+Dogbert24> curved grade is if everyone does shitty they curve it up so it looks less bad
[3:19:06] <dildozerfred> Mathew 4:36?

[3:21:36] <+phatmac16> @agami23 Arc is a silly vampire girl. She’s great.

[3:21:50] <%RubberFistFight> PAIGE HOW U GET.... PREGANTE?
[3:21:50] <Wistelligence> I DID NOT NEED THAT VISUAL
[3:21:51] <CastellanVon> Arc is basically the Tsukihime a.k.a the Moon Princess. As in a super power vampire girl.
[3:21:51] <+genowyn> Can we all agree Ciel is trash tier
[3:21:51] <element_of_loyalty> :D
[3:21:52] <CrimsonCore90> Pay rent or get out
[3:21:52] <Hybrid_Niji> OH GAWD
[3:21:53] <%mitchteck> Preggant
[3:21:58] <alextrebeken> how does lupus handle babies
[3:22:01] <TomCrimson> lol yessss
[3:22:04] <turf_wind_and_fire> What are they actually talking about? Another cat?
[3:22:09] <%ssjklyco> So it's two best friends?
[3:22:11] <element_of_loyalty> BUTT
[3:22:12] <segychan> wat
[3:22:16] <$CharlesRobinJr> i thought they were talking about a new cat
[3:22:16] <+phatmac16> Ciel was ruined due to curry
[3:22:19] <CharileMurphyPendelton> " Mustard sandwichse"
[3:22:20] <Kataguro> I find Arc boring personally, but that's because I played CIel's route first, and everyone likes the first they did more
[3:22:20] <%Agami23> she is so strong that she can rip space and time in fate/extra as soon as she regains her sanity, and does a whole goku "maybe next time we can fight for real"
[3:22:21] <cherubsanonymous> So it's Best Friends?
[3:22:28] <element_of_loyalty> Oney
[3:22:29] <blue6sub6remnant6> So much goss.
[3:22:30] <Twoiis> I liked kissyface emoji.
[3:22:33] <zamzoph> I watched all three hours of Digibro's lecture, without seeing either podcast
[3:22:40] <Kataguro> Ciel meanwhile is very cute and I wish she didn't turn full meme tier
[3:22:40] <CharileMurphyPendelton> Pat making a really good "mustard sandwich" with Paige?
[3:22:42] <%Cogito1001> The lawsuit from maddox counts too!
[3:22:45] <Worldbrand> it's honestly the natural conclusion of every ongoing comedy thing with a solidified identity
[3:22:45] <+AncelDeLambert> that sounds like homework
[3:22:46] <+genowyn> I didn't like it when Ciel cut my head off
[3:22:54] <+AXL808> whats it's learning curve?
[3:22:55] <+ShogunNoonto> neverback down
[3:22:58] <jack_s1n> im going though biggest problem now
[3:23:00] <+AncelDeLambert> byzantine, perhaps?
[3:23:01] <CrimsonCore90> What time is it? 5 o'clock?
[3:23:05] <+Grayhammatter> no
[3:23:07] <CastellanVon> I like Arc because the Tuskihime manga is a god-tier adaptation and she's the main star.
[3:23:09] <CharileMurphyPendelton> Paige could use a good "mustard sandwich" lol
[3:23:10] <+NWR_James> what
[3:23:11] <+genowyn> Remember when shiki had to kill the fucking planet to get Arcueid to cool it
[3:23:14] <tacostarvedbeast> I miss the fart gas era
[3:23:15] <flavonoskovitch> biggest problem is great in its own right and sets up the dick show for greatness
[3:23:15] <Kataguro> I liked that scene where Ciel is all "Fine, cut me. See if I care" and then she no-sells getting stabbed in the neck
[3:23:16] <Fujiwara_92> What time is it? 5 o'clock?
[3:23:21] <sgtgoatmilk181> cant cheapem the LORE by calling them in jokes
[3:23:22] <%WingBuffet> SBFP is all about the wipeouts
[3:23:26] <Kataguro> Ciel don't care
[3:23:26] <element_of_loyalty> 80'S
[3:23:30] <DAREALGUMMY> Show her the Monday Night Wars dvd ?Pat
[3:23:35] <+Blargimazombie> Honestly I don't think best friends is that in-joke heavy, more like video game industry reference heavy
[3:23:37] <+genowyn> Well she is immortal
[3:23:37] <%ssjklyco> Like comic books
[3:23:40] <CharileMurphyPendelton> What time is it? TIME TO RAPE ME SUM BEACHES lol
[3:23:40] <+phatmac16> Ciel is still a cool church exorcist at times

[3:23:52] <+genowyn> Not as cool as Kotomine

[3:23:58] <$Smolkupo> wut
[3:24:02] <%Caidezes> Predators are hot as hell.
[3:24:02] <element_of_loyalty> freak
[3:24:03] <+cvp5127> makes sense
[3:24:04] <Worldbrand> waiting on that predator x venom smut
[3:24:05] <+AntithesisEK> are we about to talk about female predators / yaujta?
[3:24:05] <+WhyIDie> "he won't rip of *my* face"
[3:24:06] <%RubberFistFight> Predator's dick is probably barbed
[3:24:07] <Fujiwara_92> Kreygasm
[3:24:08] <Hilljoy> Ok
[3:24:09] <+AntithesisEK> is it that time of night?
[3:24:09] <DiscountChicken> Predator fucking CONFIRMED

[3:24:15] <CptBritches> What time is it? 5:00?
[3:24:16] <+Grayhammatter> that's a little weird
[3:24:18] <DagetSparrow> A B S
[3:24:20] <Mr_Strut> NTR'd by the predator
[3:24:22] <DantesAnimus> give a girl a paper bag and a Predator is totally fine
[3:24:23] <Blazeofflame> Predator x 5:00
[3:24:23] <element_of_loyalty> BEIGE BALOOGA
[3:24:24] <+AXL808> Water monster from Shape of Water would probably be better
[3:24:25] <flavonoskovitch> would predator give good succ?
[3:24:26] <segychan> fucking adorable
[3:24:26] <Everpresent_Overseer> Pat is not happy
[3:24:28] <+genowyn> Ciel couldn't beat up Iri with church karate
[3:24:29] <nooblord_derpington> the xenomorphs are THICC
[3:24:30] <+NWR_James> that's actually the weirdest thing today...
[3:24:30] <Kataguro> I haven't. I need to read the Tsukihime manga. Is it like Fate's where the art gets super fucked up as it goes and we get manly Shirou?
[3:24:31] <CptBritches> Five o'clock
[3:24:32] <+phatmac16> Also, his daughter is great, too.

[3:24:36] <+Grayhammatter> the squishy skeleton
[3:24:37] <element_of_loyalty> wow
[3:24:37] <%ssjklyco> Oh god, I just remembered someone is making a movie about Harvey Weinstein called "Predator"
[3:24:41] <%Agami23> shirou kotomine is the summation of everything wrong with fate/

[3:25:18] <CastellanVon> @Kataguro No it's legitimately a god tier manga adaption that fixes some of the plot holes in the Arc route and has super good art.

[3:25:35] <Kataguro> Going to get on that ASAP then. Tsukihime is a shaky-ass sotry, but it's a cool setting
[3:25:39] <element_of_loyalty> SASSY
[3:25:40] <sgtgoatmilk181> "OH BOY" - Licker encountering paige at the fuckplace
[3:25:40] <+Grayhammatter> you might need to
[3:25:45] <jack_s1n> the weirdest thing about going though the biggest problem is Dick seems like the bad guy but future knowledge tells me otherwise
[3:25:48] <Worldbrand> time to go to the brain doctor
[3:25:48] <element_of_loyalty> GO TO BED
[3:25:52] <%SaltyDongs> what you also need is to go to bed
[3:25:55] <Kataguro> He's still shit. I don't care what Buster memes say. Rulers are for cheesing shit and fighting Mooncancer
[3:25:56] <tacostarvedbeast> Ask her to pronounce ‘escape’
[3:25:56] <KatabolicRage> Paige some people can just have inherited memory problems in day to day life, I'm the same way, I routinely walk into rooms and forget why I walked in there
[3:25:57] <Liwyn> barely hanging onto reality
[3:25:59] <+Grayhammatter> paige needs to go to bread
[3:26:01] <%Agami23> im still sad i didnt manage to get nero or nerobride

[3:26:08] <admiral_of_crunch> Man, you guys are still talking about the Nasuverse in chat and I'm getting lost as shit. Here I thought I'd understand just enough to get by from watching the Ufotable adaptations and reading the Tsukihime manga... No such luck
[3:26:11] <CastellanVon> @Kataguro Only thing you're missing from a VN experience is music, and tbh Tsuki's soundtrack is shit except the main theme.
[3:26:11] <element_of_loyalty> LEMOM
[3:26:13] <+phatmac16> @kataguro the VN is super dated so read the manga if you’re interested
[3:26:13] <SatansDick1> she gets stronger
[3:26:16] <Prism_Wing> Hypnosis is the shit, ya'll look into it!
[3:26:19] <%ssjklyco> It shits all over the plae

[3:26:41] <Kataguro> And it's stuff Nasu made in his living room on a keyboard
[3:26:44] <element_of_loyalty> Mustard on the brain
[3:26:54] <element_of_loyalty> FUCK WILL SMITH
[3:26:55] <+Grayhammatter> we must destroy the time cube
[3:26:57] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat Paige could open her own word salad bar, is what you're telling us
[3:26:59] <TalisKanju> I thought it was something Paige made up, but I saw it on another stream
[3:27:02] <xeros720> some jerks are mixing in fate/grand order memes, so yeah, it's a mess
