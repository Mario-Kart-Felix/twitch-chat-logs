[0:39:21] <captainthunderwolf> @commanderclaw I don't disagree, but as someone with business experience, it looks a LOT like the middle and upper management were abusing their IP owners and designers to make deadlines.

[1:10:10] <andreslazo8> Is it minmaxing time?
[1:10:14] <Cleverspambot> its super overwhelming, there is a reason they basically go "ADVANCED PLAYERS ONLY" on the button for it
[1:10:17] <hellothisisxig> wow i misread constitution
[1:10:17] <+radskag> jesus patrick
[1:10:20] <TheImmortal70> What the fuck is this build, you aren't even goign to punch
[1:10:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> TIME TO MINMAX
[1:10:21] <StubYourToe> i remember spending hours doing this in BG2
[1:10:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> Eeyup
[1:10:25] <ToneBacas> i like going through a game like this, but boy, does character creation feel like a chore like doing your taxes
[1:10:26] <pennykettle_> o shit when did this start, I thought it wasnt for a while
[1:10:29] <+Burger_Bonanza> If you want to mostly be CC you don't need nearly that much might
[1:10:31] <Zyquux> PERFECT
[1:10:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> SMART, AND STRONG, and smol.
[1:10:31] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> You don't say
[1:10:32] <+mcjimbo12> THE GREATEST COWARD WE EVER KNEW
[1:10:33] <MonsieurHedge> when's poe2 actually coming out again?

[1:10:39] <+radskag> ppfffppfpft
[1:10:40] <StubYourToe> few days
[1:10:42] <$rdark_ksu> wont you be so squish?
[1:10:42] <captainthunderwolf> You are made of perpetually terrified toilet paper.
[1:10:44] <StubYourToe> 8th?
[1:10:44] <$TheNeedlesD> a gust of wind could push you over
[1:10:46] <$SGrim> You are a physically frail coward! Perfect! LUL
[1:10:48] <hellothisisxig> squishy
[1:10:48] <17sevens> i am sure that a constitution of 4 will cause no problems
[1:10:52] <TioXyco> you'll need resolve!
[1:10:53] <prime_name> Punch Wizard?
[1:10:54] <startadevy> yay
[1:10:54] <Stol3nheart> @pennykettle_ he started like 20 minutes early
[1:10:54] <ToneBacas> 3 resolve: what do? WutFace
[1:10:57] <TheImmortal70> You need less might
[1:10:59] <+SchlomoGoldbergsteinowitz> This is what we call the paige build
[1:11:04] <+ItsNineTen> dump might
[1:11:04] <+shinpete> You are a wizard, why do you have so much might? admiral6
[1:11:07] <deliciouspies> You want Con for more HP my dude
[1:11:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> There ya go
[1:11:09] <TheImmortal70> Definitely want resolve over constitution since that has dialogue abilities
[1:11:09] <%MaiHusbando9S> no make it more fucked
[1:11:11] <hntronium> More resolve
[1:11:13] <leinadtonu> a mighty wizard, eh?
[1:11:14] <krabsan> YOU GOTTA PUT AT LEAST ON EACH
[1:11:14] <+dodge_and_dust> why are you getting might for a mage?
[1:11:16] <+mcjimbo12> @shinpete might isn't physical strength, it's damage
[1:11:18] <PlatinumWyvern> oh my god, why does a wizard need strength and dex? pvpLUL
[1:11:18] <+shinpete> Isn't might a complete waste?
[1:11:19] <andreslazo8> Yeah, actually, why is that wizard so strong?
[1:11:21] <captainthunderwolf> @shinpete Might is just a raw damage stat, Intellect is AoE
[1:11:21] <strangelee> Less Resolve
[1:11:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> You need a bit more resolve for mage.
[1:11:23] <%commanderclaw> @shinpete It effects spell strenght
[1:11:24] <%kujofire990> HUGE WIZARD
[1:11:29] <mr_slaide> Might = damage
[1:11:30] <awinters> might determines damage and healing
[1:11:31] <+radskag> beefy wizard
[1:11:32] <PulverKong> might = spiritual strengt = magic damage
[1:11:34] <Twoiis> might is right
[1:11:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> Might = damage and heals
[1:11:36] <+shinpete> Ah, thanks, guys.
[1:11:37] <%ssaryn> Oh wow that's pretty cool actually
[1:11:41] <PulverKong> it's raw damage
[1:11:42] <andreslazo8> Really? That sounds silly
[1:11:42] <+radskag> might is Big Damage
[1:11:44] <$TheNeedlesD> Plus it says in caps, highly recommended for wizards
[1:11:46] <Tarantella8> why isn't it strength?
[1:11:51] <+dodge_and_dust> oh. that is odd
[1:11:56] <hippofant> @Tarantella8 Cuz it affects all damage
[1:11:56] <Too_Much_Nukie> Might is VITAL for wizards.
[1:11:57] <+mcjimbo12> because it's strength in every other game
[1:12:00] <Fujiwara_92> odd numbers NotLikeThis
[1:12:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR WIZARD. Hmm... I bet it's bad for casting.
[1:12:04] <%ziriken> Whiteland
[1:12:04] <viewtifulr> then be a diamond thumbtack
[1:12:05] <%SulphuricHunter> you throw the spells really hard
[1:12:05] <Cleverspambot> i thought you wanted CC mage why might than? per and int are way better for your build
[1:12:05] <Lammali> Ah, home sweet home.
[1:12:06] <+shinpete> YUUUGE Damage LuL
[1:12:08] <+MrRabbles> cause street rules thats why Kappa
[1:12:09] <%ssaryn> Might as well keep going Deadire.
[1:12:10] <captainthunderwolf> @Tarantella8 Strength specifically implies physical damage.
[1:12:10] <Too_Much_Nukie> Might is why multiclassing in this game makes more sense.
[1:12:13] <@PeachSaliva> Boooo
[1:12:13] <ArcticAsylum> THE WHITE
[1:12:15] <+gloppie> Is this game playable without having played the first one?
[1:12:16] <deliciouspies> slave
[1:12:16] <+radskag> deadfireeee
[1:12:18] <@PeachSaliva> Pat a fuck
[1:12:19] <Fujiwara_92> Boooo
[1:12:20] <hellothisisxig> i cant read them
[1:12:21] <PulverKong> strength kind of refers to raw muscle strengt. Might is more spiritual aswell
[1:12:22] <Tarantella8> makes sense
[1:12:22] <awinters> you are a SLAVE to CHEESE!
[1:12:22] <$TheNeedlesD> Streetwise
[1:12:24] <@PeachSaliva> Boooo
[1:12:25] <ELuscious> @AngriestPat have you ever played arcanum?
[1:12:26] <%ssaryn> @PeachSaliva Noooooooo he a good boi
[1:12:27] <lankaster88> Slave
[1:12:28] <hippofant> @andreslazo8 Might isn't as good as it seems, because the multipliers are applied additively, not multiplicatively. And in PoE1 there was a cap of 200%, I think.
[1:12:29] <%ziriken> slave
[1:12:29] <+aperez928> So is Barbarian/Druid a good idea for my playthrough
[1:12:30] <dreamfillah> WELL DWARF DRUID.

[1:13:44] <Ser_Randal> @AngriestPat YOU CAN DUAL WIELD PISTOLS AND BLUNDERBUSSES
[1:13:45] <+griffball13> the greatest magic there is is gun
[1:13:48] <+ItsNineTen> small firearm for small man
[1:13:49] <+mcjimbo12> @Polengoldur I don't think comparing the games is really fair
[1:13:49] <+LogothX> The solution to every problem is gun
[1:13:49] <PulverKong> He isn't aware that paige is trolling his chat
[1:13:51] <%ssaryn> It seems like Pistols are one-handed.
[1:13:54] <awinters> you can't one-hand a pistol.... think about the reload
[1:13:55] <lankaster88> Gunner dwarf mage
[1:14:00] <+shinpete> Are weapons not based on the core stats? Like int for wands and guns for dex or something?
[1:14:00] <prime_name> Could a decent Laptop run Pillars 2?
[1:14:02] <Fujiwara_92> yeah TWO HAND THE PISTOL PAT SwiftRage
[1:14:02] <+aperez928> @Polengoldur They both have their pros
[1:14:02] <captainthunderwolf> DWARF CASTS GUN
[1:14:02] <Cleverspambot> you can also duel blunderbusses

[1:14:20] <+aperez928> @Polengoldur Depends on my mood really, but right now Pillars for me
[1:14:23] <drakthebest> Remember that because of the way dr works damage and armor penetration is worth more than attack speed

[1:25:46] <+MrRabbles> is he a dwarf? or a hunchback man that pretends to be a dwarf?
[1:25:47] <TheImmortal70> Patron the wizard has a certain like of horse anime
[1:25:48] <+TeethMuncher> that's an aggressive stance alright

[1:42:03] <captainthunderwolf> I don't like that they changed Eder's face into a similar-looking man, but I do like the new art style.
[1:42:05] <+aperez928> @bmj614 Matt Mercer
[1:42:07] <hazardkujacker> @bmj614 nope, it's dungeon master jesus Matt Mercer
[1:42:09] <WhatzePh> @reiju_22 Or Divinity: Original Sin. Or most of the Ys games.
[1:42:10] <awinters> the first level is mandatory
[1:42:14] <captainthunderwolf> But he really does look a little too much like someone else for my tastes.
[1:42:14] <startadevy> caution: trees do not move
[1:42:19] <+aperez928> The entire cast of Critical Role is here
[1:42:21] <+radskag> yes
[1:42:25] <SuperSymn> he still hasn't level up, reload was unnecessary
[1:42:30] <+radskag> theyre all default
[1:42:40] <Cleverspambot> you get new power levels slower, thats p much it
[1:42:42] <hazardkujacker> @aperez928 as soon as I get the game Im rolling Gilmore

[1:43:16] <Cleverspambot> wizards are dorks
[1:43:19] <+radskag> god i love goblin patron
[1:43:19] <%WackyGear> @angriestpat do you think you'll ever do pillars guides like wollie's DBFZ ones?
[1:43:24] <captainthunderwolf> Yo chat, is anyone else already planning out there multiclass? I'm thinking of a Rogue/Cipher for big damage and lots of statuses to enable Sneak Attack.
[1:43:28] <+aperez928> @hazardkujacker NICE NICE NICE
[1:43:29] <Dellago> With the Gilmore voice and Im assuming one of the custom voices from the cc you can almost have an entire party of Matt Mercers. What a time to be alive
[1:43:38] <TyrantBelial> actually right now his stuff is just as good due to how scaling is.
[1:43:52] <Cleverspambot> plus if this game still has riposte that will be really strong

[1:50:11] <+shinpete> Just start streaming lol 4Head
[1:50:34] <captainthunderwolf> @aperez928 Barb/Druid will be good for DPS and be alright for regen and some ranged spell damage. If you want to be a fucking WALL OF PAIN, Barb/Monk is always a righteous choice.
[1:50:41] <+radskag> akeeeyama
[1:50:49] <Mexrage> on PoE 1 i had a cipher with 3 pistols with quickswitch, i opened up by shoting like twice, then casting spells and then shot again with the 3rd gun
[1:50:50] <+Pendlez> shit, I almost forgot how much I love 9S
[1:50:57] <+aperez928> @captainthunderwolf I will definitely look into that

[1:58:11] <+mcjimbo12> @olliedelosa you can play it through once to get the gist of the systems and then replay it on a harder difficulty to explore new classes/companions/story, to get the full experience
[1:58:12] <+radskag> this is the content im here for
[1:58:13] <captainthunderwolf> @aperez928 Exactly. Hell, Monks don't even need to use bare-handed in Pillars, so you can rock twin axes with lifesteal if you want.

[1:59:44] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[1:59:44] <+mcjimbo12> it makes me so sad
[1:59:46] <Zyquux> Grog?
[1:59:46] <Ser_Randal> its tupac
[1:59:47] <TomCrimson> who OooOOo
[1:59:49] <%ToxInjection> A N I M A T I O N S
[1:59:59] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Skyrim sneaking
[2:00:01] <+radskag> durance is Mentioned but i think that's it
[2:00:01] <captainthunderwolf> @aperez928 If you ever wanna play Rogue, don't forget that sneaking up and shooting someone in the back of the head with a shotgun is also a completely viable build.
[2:00:10] <Mexrage> Yeah, probably one of the biggest improvements for graphics imo, are the animations
[2:00:10] <+radskag> eyyy tupac
[2:00:14] <lankaster88> This is looking real good so far
[2:00:15] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Man Pillars is radical
[2:00:27] <%TheMattman1313> Snake! Remember the basics of CQC!
[2:00:36] <captainthunderwolf> Pillars is pretty radical.
[2:00:37] <Ser_Randal> GELLARDE
[2:00:42] <@thenefftw> GELLARDE
[2:00:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> Can you pickpocket in this game?
[2:00:43] <Mexrage> omg, stealth is more involved now, i wonder if this will make stealth solo run easier
[2:00:50] <captainthunderwolf> And multiclassing makes me a little aroused, I can't deny
[2:00:56] <+radskag> save barrel ladyyyy
[2:01:03] <Shooterboy23> oh shit is that a Deep space 9 reference on that boat?
[2:01:06] <hippofant> @captainthunderwolf Okay, but what about dual-classing? :P
[2:01:07] <+XxBTExX> quick Pat. Sex her.
[2:01:07] <%commanderclaw> @GarbageQueenEllie you can even reverse pickpocket explosives
[2:01:11] <+radskag> get ur crew bro
[2:01:14] <%ToxInjection> accents Kreygasm
[2:01:17] <hippofant> @Shooterboy23 The Defiant? :)
[2:01:25] <Shooterboy23> yeaaa boii
[2:01:26] <$FriedMattato> Is the PC a new person or the same person from Pillars 1?
[2:01:27] <Hispanacomida25> Woo her so you can betray her later like a G
[2:01:27] <+radskag> i love all the accents
[2:01:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> @commanderclaw Sick.
[2:01:49] <+radskag> party assist is so good
[2:01:51] <Hispanacomida25> Why is she calling you a house in spanish
[2:01:57] <+aperez928> @captainthunderwolf I'm going to guess an Aumaua would be best for a Ravager wall of pain build?
[2:01:59] <captainthunderwolf> Oh yeah chat, in case anyone didn't know, Spain and Italy are the same country in this world and also they're inhabited by black people, which is a very neat spin on the French practice of making colonies like Cote d'Ivoire that are culturally French.
[2:02:23] <count_bob> I like that bit.
[2:02:26] <Reckless_Rob> Yeah the voice acting is great man, and so plentiful
[2:02:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> Which results in some sexy accents
[2:02:29] <applesonthemoon> thats real neato
[2:02:31] <+aperez928> @captainthunderwolf Stealth Shotgun jesus christ
[2:02:31] <Shooterboy23> black french girls Kreygasm
[2:02:39] <Cucamabungabu> Pat do you still enjoy warframe? How many hours have you played?
[2:02:39] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Hi Travis
[2:02:41] <prime_name> Travis PogCHamp
[2:02:45] <InspectahDecck> Black french girls are cursed
[2:02:49] <%ToxInjection> that's super cool. It's shit like that that makes me wanna give PoE1 another shot
[2:02:50] <DatAsuna> JOlee?
[2:02:51] <+griffball13> RACITS
[2:02:52] <captainthunderwolf> @aperez928 Almost certainly, but look through the Godlikes in case there's a passive buff you might like. Monk/Barbarians don't wear much armor, so not wearing a helmet isn't such a bad deal.
[2:02:52] <LunarLancaster> Hey there, Travis
[2:03:03] <+TeethMuncher> boars too strong
[2:03:06] <AlasterAngelo> are the Critical Role characters actually in this
[2:03:06] <hazardkujacker> Trrrraaavis Willingham HYUK HYUK
[2:03:08] <+radskag> oh it IS travis damn
[2:03:10] <+aperez928> @captainthunderwolf Coool, thanks!
[2:03:15] <blackorchidKI2> Before now I never cared for this game. Now I'm totally interested
[2:03:15] <KingOfTheGeats> I see it
[2:03:16] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> @AlasterAngelo Yeyeye
[2:03:19] <+radskag> hes voicing shark boi too iirc
[2:03:23] <%KaironFortressKnight> I fucking love Travis Willingham man
[2:03:23] <Hispanacomida25> I want Travis to carry me home.
[2:03:24] <AlasterAngelo> neat
[2:03:27] <+aperez928> @captainthunderwolf I actually do really appreciate this my dude
[2:03:29] <%commanderclaw> Travis is the best player in CR
[2:03:29] <Cucamabungabu> @AngriestPat Pat do you still enjoy warframe? How many hours have you played?
[2:03:36] <Shooterboy23> black france is new orleans. You know whos also from new orleans? Ben Sisko. Deep space 9 baybeeee
[2:03:37] <Hispanacomida25> With his big tower man self
[2:03:41] <KingOfTheGeats> Travis and Sam are my favorite
[2:03:41] <captainthunderwolf> @aperez928 Absolutely no probs at all, broheim. I really hope you enjoy the game, man.
[2:03:43] <%ziriken> But you hate getting shot
[2:03:44] <%cervidaequus> i am now le sub and i want you to understand, i did it entirely so that i could shitpost winky elmo in other people's chats @AngriestPat
[2:03:46] <Zyquux> @AlasterAngelo I don't think so, buy you can certainly make them because their voices and portraits are in
[2:03:47] <+griffball13> gun is best magic
[2:03:50] <+aperez928> @captainthunderwolf What is your first build going to look like?
[2:03:53] <%ToxInjection> Are we about to come across Laura Bailey soon? Is the entire fucking cast of Critical Role in this game? Cause that'd be sick.
[2:03:54] <@thenefftw> Big grown up
[2:03:54] <Reckless_Rob> Why is it appropriate?
[2:03:55] <blackorchidKI2> Ohai Travis Willingham
[2:04:00] <IminyourBase> gun is magic
[2:04:05] <+radskag> gun wizard best wizard
[2:04:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> Gun Wizard is your spirit animal
[2:04:07] <+aperez928> @ToxInjection They are actually
[2:04:10] <TyrantBelial> @AngriestPat Pat, Pathfinder has a version of wizard who exist purely to be a Gunwizard, called Spellslinger, they have absurd crit damage on spells.
[2:04:13] <+itslitfam603> the wizard that finger bangs
[2:04:13] <+mcjimbo12> @ToxInjection they're all in it and i'm pretty sure they all voice companions but i could be wrong on that
[2:04:18] <Everpresent_Overseer> I cast bullet to the face!
[2:04:20] <hazardkujacker> @ToxInjection yep, all of CR is in this game, both as characters and as VOx Mahcina
[2:04:20] <+timblenaut> fragLeft VoHiYo fragRight
[2:04:21] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> @ToxInjection There's a free DLC for the entire Campaign 1 character list, I think. Even Matt as Gilmore
[2:04:23] <+aperez928> @ToxInjection Like legit all of them
[2:04:33] <+Meiou> lol that would be awesome if the whole critical role group was in this . even more so if they played their s1 characters
[2:04:42] <@thenefftw> HOBO PAT
[2:04:43] <captainthunderwolf> Also chat, the great thing in this universe is that the Dyrwood is basically America, but in the Pillars world it's actually weird and niche to drink alcohol. Everyone basically does cocaine, weed, salvia or opium to relax instead.
[2:04:43] <%KaironFortressKnight> I suddenly feel like playing Xillia 2 cuz Travis as Gaius is the best
[2:04:49] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> @Meiou That's exactly what's in the game
[2:04:51] <TheImmortal70> Aww yeah look as shitty as possible
[2:04:53] <+MrRabbles> this is to go even further beyond into hobo stance
[2:04:54] <captainthunderwolf> Because there's a bunch of naturally-occurring drugs in the Dyrwood.
[2:04:55] <Tulugaq1> why is he cowering
[2:04:55] <+Superstarsage> Jesus it gets worse
[2:04:57] <%ToxInjection> Holy shit, that's awesome! Guess it shouldn't surprise me though given how into this stuff all of them are. Thanks for the info guys!
[2:05:03] <%TenderBabyBacon> feel the dark side flow through you
[2:05:06] <+radskag> sexy
[2:05:07] <+DeadlyToastY> patron looks like he sells deathsticks
[2:05:09] <+aperez928> @Meiou They actually 100% are
[2:05:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> Your character looks like a flasher now
[2:05:12] <+radskag> palpatine vibes
[2:05:13] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Robes are identical in stats to normal clothes
[2:05:16] <+radskag> awwww
[2:05:17] <+Endevin> Yo Pat how's it looking so far?
[2:05:17] <+Meiou> now i really want this game XP
[2:05:21] <hazardkujacker> I hope pat accidentally ends up making an entire party with all the CR voice actors
[2:05:22] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> the power to distort time and reality! F5
[2:05:26] <ragasquid> is it still prerendered backgrounds
[2:05:28] <+radskag> SO quick
[2:05:30] <%cervidaequus> DA DA DA DA DA DA
[2:05:33] <Lammali> Spoopy
[2:05:33] <count_bob> SKELETON WARRIORS!
[2:05:34] <hazardkujacker> DADADADADADA
[2:05:34] <+MrRabbles> i hope voice lines don't keep getting interrupted that easily
[2:05:34] <+griffball13> SKELETON WARRIOR
[2:05:35] <%kujofire990> Da da da da da daaaaaa
[2:05:35] <@thenefftw> SKELETON WARRIOR
[2:05:36] <%FriedMattato> SKELETON WARRIRORS
[2:05:36] <$TheNeedlesD> Pat
[2:05:45] <+radskag> SKELETON WARRIORS
[2:05:46] <$SGrim> Gradually just becoming Rasputin. SeemsGood
[2:05:47] <SatansDick1> skeleton warrior PogChamp PogChamp
[2:05:47] <Valask> using guns against a fucking skeleton
[2:05:48] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> Don't give up! Skeleton!
[2:05:50] <Mexrage> how do you penetrate a skeleton
[2:05:50] <Tulugaq1> BANG THOSE BONES
[2:05:53] <$TheNeedlesD> why are you trying to penetrate a skeleton?
[2:05:55] <Valask> patrick boivin ladies and gents
[2:05:57] <Cleverspambot> he is a skeleton, he dont have gizzards to shoot!
[2:06:01] <+radskag> GUN SKELETON
[2:06:04] <BusyMaribo> DADA DADA DADADA
[2:06:07] <Dellago> Im guessing that white circle is the ranged in which sneak attacks can be used. I know there's a distance limit
[2:06:07] <+aperez928> @captainthunderwolf I thought you meant in the actual wood at first glance
[2:06:11] <$HeavyMettle> To be fair, if you have really good aim then breaking the spine would beat it
[2:06:13] <captainthunderwolf> @aperez928 Mindstalker (Rogue/Cipher), guaranteed. Lots of possession skills, huge sneak attack damage, and me running off like a bitch when I run out of Focus and need to hide again.
[2:06:13] <+reaped_psyche> HANG IN THERE SKELETON!
[2:06:15] <+aperez928> @captainthunderwolf EAT THE WOOD FOR DRUGS
[2:06:16] <deliciouspies> every skeleton has a skull tho
[2:06:22] <deliciouspies> and bullets break those
[2:06:25] <%KaironFortressKnight> @Mexrage First, you need to believe a skeleton can be penetrated. The rest just comes naturally.
[2:06:29] <+radskag> bones weak to Bullets
[2:06:31] <$HeavyMettle> skeletons don't need their skulls. They are alive with magis
[2:06:33] <captainthunderwolf> @aperez928 No but one of the drugs actually is tree wood. Like that's super real in-game.
[2:06:33] <$HeavyMettle> magic*
[2:06:38] <Necroe> as a wizard i cant say how happy i am that there is no more per rest cohhT
[2:06:48] <captainthunderwolf> ^
[2:06:49] <@thenefftw> Penetrate that skeleton
[2:06:49] <%TheMattman1313> *pulls up the Skeleton Warrior OP SourPls
[2:06:51] <deliciouspies> but the skeleton doesn't know it doesn't need a head
[2:06:52] <+Noni321> @AngriestPat Hey Pat you finish God of War yet?
[2:06:52] <Valask> No disengage?
[2:06:53] <TyrantBelial> But we all now Pat's all about penetration.
[2:06:54] <$HeavyMettle> but if you snap the spine their threat level is vastly diminished
[2:06:55] <+aperez928> @captainthunderwolf Eat this fucking wood to get blasted
[2:06:59] <Valask> jesus
[2:07:01] <Reckless_Rob> Kablammo!
[2:07:02] <captainthunderwolf> Per rest is good for tabletop, but kind of tiring in a game.
[2:07:05] <applesonthemoon> skeledropped
[2:07:07] <%Cynful_Pleasures> HE ASSPLODED
[2:07:10] <Dellago> Yeah Im happy about no per-rest stuff, very freeing
[2:07:11] <%KaironFortressKnight> SHIELD SKELMO'S EYES
[2:07:11] <SatansDick1> explode skeleman
[2:07:12] <+radskag> bone armour????
[2:07:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> I would love it if your party tried to carry bust mom with you
[2:07:14] <Cleverspambot> swash eder is a monster
[2:07:16] <+Templar15> BAHGAWD
[2:07:19] <+aperez928> @captainthunderwolf Also your build sounds sick dude
[2:07:20] <acridPaladin> Poor Beetle
[2:07:22] <+radskag> damn
[2:07:23] <+MrRabbles> gun is still the best magic
[2:07:24] <captainthunderwolf> @aperez928 They basically soak it in scotch and get high on their drug-infused alcohol.
[2:07:26] <%AbnormalVoid> Beetleborg!
[2:07:29] <$HeavyMettle> I think you are being blocked by terrain
[2:07:34] <Valask> it's a pistol, not an arbalist
[2:07:42] <+radskag> SHOOT BUG
[2:07:42] <$HeavyMettle> is that a thing?
[2:07:56] <$HeavyMettle> the bridge post was between pistol and target
[2:07:57] <startadevy> <3
[2:07:59] <+Burger_Bonanza> Pat, don't forget the WIZARD part of gun wizard
[2:07:59] <roada_rolla_da> Look at big boy Pat here, getting early access to games and stuff
[2:08:00] <Mexrage> i guess they nerfed pistols damage, but increased reload speed?
[2:08:01] <+radskag> i think only solid walls block shots
[2:08:05] <+Burger_Bonanza> your spells are per-encounter now!
[2:08:15] <+radskag> yea use spells!!
[2:08:15] <$HeavyMettle> @radskag ah, thanks
[2:08:24] <Dellago> Unf those spell effects are nice
[2:08:26] <%KaironFortressKnight> How could you do all this Skeleton Genocide in front of Skelmo, Pat? HOW?!
[2:08:28] <sponsoredviewer910> LUL
[2:08:29] <Valask> rip
[2:08:29] <@thenefftw> Jesus
[2:08:30] <Reckless_Rob> Kapowz!
[2:08:32] <all4integrity> Can change combat speed under movement speed
[2:08:33] <%ziriken> big pops
[2:08:37] <captainthunderwolf> @aperez928 Thanks! I played Cipher in the first game, see, but I was disappointed by how low my melee damage was for a class built around weapon attacks to cast spells. But Cipher and Rogue both have passive weapon damage buffs, so when layered they hit super hard.
[2:08:37] <General_Terro> big strong magic
[2:08:39] <hazardkujacker> D E S T R O Y E D
[2:08:41] <+MrRabbles> he died before he could live
[2:08:41] <Andrei11Droasca> Finally I catch one these!
[2:08:42] <+radskag> rip in pieces
[2:08:44] <Tulugaq1> skelmo seems horrified
[2:08:44] <SatansDick1> KAPOW
[2:08:45] <%commanderclaw> Cover Skellmo's eyes, this skeleton violence is not for him
[2:08:46] <deliciouspies> skelmo's mouth is agape in the horror
[2:09:03] <$HeavyMettle> I think someone said Cipher's have their own specific sub class now
[2:09:23] <Hispanacomida25> Skellmo has no choice but to scream a voiceless scream, for the horrors are too great and Pat refuses to stop
[2:09:27] <+radskag> all classes now have subclasses
[2:09:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> Put the spells into your gun
[2:09:36] <%xemnahort> what do you all think is better the pillars of eternity series or the divinity: original sin series
[2:09:36] <+aperez928> @captainthunderwolf That makes sense. So you're basically getting what you wanted in the first place, if not better
[2:09:48] <+Pendlez> are you programming rn
[2:09:49] <Andrei11Droasca> So dose pat still play a rough elf?
[2:09:50] <Necroe> im geting a tactics screen boner cohhMy
[2:09:53] <Reckless_Rob> Reminds me of dragon age, but more options
[2:09:53] <startadevy> daz3d man
[2:09:57] <%KaironFortressKnight> Oh, not more Skeleton murder
[2:09:58] <Mexrage> Gambits!
[2:10:06] <+griffball13> attack the darkness
[2:10:12] <$HeavyMettle> @radskag I saw someone else playing and they weren't sure to go cipher, barb or hybrid. Chat told him Cipher had a secret or specific sub class he wouldn't be able to access by choosing other two options
[2:10:13] <+radskag> god im never even gonna Touch the tactics stuff
[2:10:14] <hazardkujacker> KINETIC CARD
[2:10:17] <@thenefftw> Old Man Hobo Pat
[2:10:18] <+aperez928> @Andrei11Droasca No, he's a gross dwarf with fucked up hands
[2:10:20] <captainthunderwolf> Yeah, the Cipher subclasses are basically: "Free spells for a while sometimes," "Massive single-hit nuke spell", and "Everyone is on my team now, I stole their minds, they're my team now." @HeavyMettle
[2:10:21] <SatansDick1> that looks really cool
[2:10:28] <StubYourToe> Nosferatu Pat
[2:10:30] <Garrison27> Hello all
[2:10:36] <+aperez928> @Andrei11Droasca And he's a GUN MAGE
[2:10:37] <Cleverspambot> Patron the Not creepy at all what are you talking about
[2:10:38] <Reckless_Rob> Jesus?
[2:10:39] <startadevy> yesterday
[2:10:43] <%AbnormalVoid> HoliestPat
[2:10:45] <Garrison27> Has he let it set in yet?
[2:10:48] <StubYourToe> @Garrison27 Sup m8
[2:10:54] <kylejefferies> !uptime
[2:10:54] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 11m 3s.
[2:11:02] <+fallenangelzelos> man I can't wait until I can afford this game
[2:11:08] <+radskag> @heavymettle oh i think the only subclasses tht are restricted are the paladin n priest orders
[2:11:08] <Tulugaq1> so whats up with pats hunched over cowering dude
[2:11:11] <Dellago> I love how Patron defaults to standing normally then readjusts into his creeper stance
[2:11:11] <Cptn_Turtle> is that MaTt MerCer
[2:11:18] <$TheNeedlesD> its coloured like a zubat
[2:11:19] <+aperez928> @captainthunderwolf "look at me, I am the captain now"
[2:11:23] <%KaironFortressKnight> Ah yes, a sea-faring bat.
[2:11:24] <StubYourToe> wowie!
[2:11:25] <captainthunderwolf> @aperez928 Exactly! I see the Rogue dualclass as a buff to my Cipher, as opposed to the creation of its own disparate class. But also, I see my Cipher's damage bonus as an upgrade to the natural benefits of a Rogue. They line up really well!
[2:11:29] <%AbnormalVoid> Kick his ass Sea Bat!
[2:11:30] <$HeavyMettle> I just pre ordered dragons crown pro and bought a few comics today. I have no discretionary income for this game lol
[2:11:32] <+griffball13> pat loves missing
[2:11:39] <%jiin6> thats Pat
[2:11:39] <+timblenaut> you're playing like my ranger, rolling 2's
[2:11:40] <captainthunderwolf> @aperez928 "Look into my eyes. I am the captain. I am the captain now."
[2:11:54] <@thenefftw> Nice
[2:11:55] <count_bob> Rapid shot.
[2:11:56] <GarbageQueenEllie> A sea bat? Does it know the sea bear?
[2:12:02] <count_bob> Rapid shopt lowers accuracy.
[2:12:06] <BusyMaribo> it probably was
[2:12:07] <+Floorislava> jorbsButter
[2:12:08] <%jiin6> bet it was?
[2:12:09] <+aperez928> Ah shit I have to leave for a bit
[2:12:11] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat You have rapid shot on, it increases speed but lowers accuracy
[2:12:14] <Andrei11Droasca> Wait that's Eder, I thought this was supposed to take place in the future?
[2:12:15] <+aperez928> I hope I don't miss too much
[2:12:17] <sponsoredviewer910> probably the most important piece of info in the game
[2:12:22] <awinters> you are a level 1 wizard
[2:12:23] <Reckless_Rob> 25 accuracy?
[2:12:26] <awinters> can't hit shit
[2:12:29] <deliciouspies> how fucking far did this dwarf chase the boar? past all the skeletons and sea bats
[2:12:31] <Cleverspambot> wizards arent very accurate
[2:12:32] <%KaironFortressKnight> So how come the bats in here are called Sea Bats, but the Skeletons are not Sea Skeletons?
[2:12:34] <+radskag> rapid shot reduces it
[2:12:35] <captainthunderwolf> @aperez928 Just catch the VOD. I think Pat might stream this tomorrow as well. Have fun!
[2:12:51] <%ziriken> @radskag but he turned it off, didnt he?
[2:12:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> I guess the balancing of the pistols being 1-handed is that they're inaccurate as fuck.
[2:12:58] <+aperez928> @captainthunderwolf Have good day dude! Thanks for the help
[2:13:04] <captainthunderwolf> @KaironFortressKnight Because it's naturally implied that all skeletons are Sea skeletons, silly.
[2:13:13] <startadevy> vitamin
[2:13:22] <%jiin6> oh no not traps
[2:13:23] <Cleverspambot> accuracy aint to bad if you one hand it, if its like the first game
[2:13:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ed Edd and Eder
[2:13:23] <%KaironFortressKnight> @captainthunderwolf You have opened my eyes, Captain.
[2:13:33] <+radskag> @ziriken oh did he? then i have no idea :0
[2:13:33] <+griffball13> but are they gay?
[2:13:37] <captainthunderwolf> @Too_Much_Nukie Which is why you can dual-wield them now, yeah. Two shots = Gooder accuracy by the law of large numbers.
[2:13:41] <Lee_The_Limey> Kreygasm traps
[2:13:45] <Ser_Randal> Lewd~
[2:13:45] <+radskag> oh have fun w this
[2:13:52] <captainthunderwolf> @KaironFortressKnight Just doing my part, man.
[2:13:54] <TalisKanju> Is this better than Divinity Original Sin 2
[2:14:02] <StubYourToe> beowulf, i thought that said
[2:14:12] <startadevy> eat your vegetables
[2:14:14] <captainthunderwolf> D:OS2 is pretty good. But this looks like it might be better.
[2:14:16] <%commanderclaw> @TalisKanju It depends on if you want real time with pause or turn based combat
[2:14:17] <+radskag> more grumpy gunger dwarves yaaaayy
[2:14:18] <%Luckdragon88> Talis, i have found Pillars to be much better
[2:14:21] <+radskag> ginger
[2:14:25] <+radskag> whoops
[2:14:26] <%ToxInjection> LUL
[2:14:36] <Reckless_Rob> Eder carry, with these checks
[2:14:40] <captainthunderwolf> D:OS2 has a MAJOR problem where all of the late-game skills just aren't as good as the early game ones, so almost every spell tree is a letdown.
[2:14:47] <captainthunderwolf> That really dampened the experience for me.
[2:14:55] <captainthunderwolf> But it is a great game!
[2:15:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> A simple solution, but an effective one
[2:15:16] <+radskag> now shoot da barrel
[2:15:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> I feel you. I had to install a mod for a custom class to really get into the game.
[2:15:21] <captainthunderwolf> ^
[2:15:22] <@thenefftw> SHOOT
[2:15:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> Void Knight class, FYI.

[2:15:38] <jacknerik> is that matt mercer
[2:15:40] <captainthunderwolf> I had to get the whole, "Scoundrel skills don't need Daggers" mod to enjoy the game at all.
[2:15:41] <+radskag> beautiful
[2:15:46] <acridPaladin> Pat the Dwarf Goblin cant help but shoot everything
[2:15:47] <captainthunderwolf> Because WHY THE FUCK DOES THIS GAME HAVE SPEARS
[2:15:48] <hazardkujacker> Matthew "No Mercy" Mercer
[2:15:50] <captainthunderwolf> IF THE DEX CLASS
[2:15:53] <captainthunderwolf> NEEDS DAGGERS?????
[2:15:53] <+radskag> every answer is GUN
[2:15:55] <%jiin6> No, its PAT
[2:16:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> "I feel tougher/smarter when I've got all of my friends with me."
[2:16:04] <%commanderclaw> @hazardkujacker Matt the merciful more like
[2:16:05] <startadevy> they need JUMP
[2:16:11] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> did I catch the tail end of the stream?

[2:16:26] <startadevy> a4vChad
[2:16:26] <+radskag> nah its only been an hour
[2:16:36] <$TheNeedlesD> @Doctor_Death_Bed Nah, seems to be the big middle of the stream
[2:16:37] <captainthunderwolf> Patron the Cowar: "Cyka blyat."
[2:16:39] <+radskag> still p early
[2:16:41] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> awesome
[2:16:46] <$TheNeedlesD> so you're good
[2:16:57] <cgmerryo> does pat say elder wrong on purpose?
[2:16:57] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> oh it's just Matt Mercer again
[2:17:07] <cgmerryo> eder*
[2:17:10] <StubYourToe> cant wait to buy this shit
[2:17:13] <+radskag> theres a battle speed slider
[2:17:17] <jacknerik> wow its just fuking mcree
[2:17:20] <%jiin6> NO, THIS IS PATRICK apatSmug
[2:17:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> EEEEEETUR
[2:17:28] <captainthunderwolf> Matt Mercer prays for the day a game doesn't have his voice in it, but he wakes up every morning in a new sound booth.
[2:17:30] <+radskag> fantasy mccree
[2:17:32] <captainthunderwolf> Being a new handsome man.
[2:17:35] <+mcjimbo12> pillars 1 predates mcree
[2:17:36] <ragasquid> a fancy lad!
[2:17:37] <startadevy> PAX
[2:17:37] <@thenefftw> You're still a creepy hobo with that hat
[2:17:38] <Tulugaq1> a fancy little coward
[2:17:38] <captainthunderwolf> And he knows the cycle continues.
[2:17:39] <StubYourToe> a fancy fiesty dwarven sullen guy
[2:17:44] <Mexrage> it's like if normal speed is PoE1's slow speed, also animations being longer and more detailed make it easier to keep track of everything, while on PoE1 some abilities and attacks would be something you may miss or not notice at all @AngriestPat
[2:17:48] <StubYourToe> and also hobo with money
[2:17:48] <+radskag> fancy lad!
[2:17:54] <%jiin6> look at that Hobo Dwarf
[2:17:55] <startadevy> MAG
[2:17:59] <startadevy> fest
[2:18:01] <+redstonej> More penetration ?
[2:18:04] <+radskag> love it
[2:18:09] <%Luckdragon88> wasnt he an elf in the first game?
[2:18:10] <%TenderBabyBacon> he looks like a scummy merchent
[2:18:13] <%jiin6> Fancy hobo dwarf
[2:18:14] <%SneakyPenguin77> Howdy Pat, Just made it home from errands
[2:18:15] <+peregrin_iii> Hey tdogDog
[2:18:20] <InsomniacPersona> @AngriestPat you should watch SAO Alternative, it is amazing spinoff not by writer and no Kirito! Her P-Chan GOUGI is strong
[2:18:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> Now he looks like one of those lecherous merchant men from Ancient Greece
[2:18:30] <startadevy> pew pew pew
[2:18:34] <captainthunderwolf> @Mexrage Yeah, PoE1 has this huge issue where skills and auto-attacks happen so fast that you get no sense of impact. There's just this messy slur of skills going on that you can't keep the pace of? If that makes sense.
[2:18:37] <Andrei11Droasca> Shit Matt Mercer is in everything now this, GOW Dragon Ball, and so much other shit!
[2:18:48] <+mcjimbo12> matt mercer is in GOW?
[2:18:50] <%AbnormalVoid> it works, because Eder is protecting a minor
[2:18:52] <+radskag> the diff ring art is super nice
[2:18:53] <%jiin6> he wasn't in GOW
[2:19:07] <+mcjimbo12> fuck that looks GOOD
[2:19:11] <Endlesslyforgetful> v pretty
[2:19:12] <startadevy> total gem

[2:19:29] <+mcjimbo12> BIG STRONG FARMER TANK
[2:19:30] <+radskag> so gooood
[2:19:30] <captainthunderwolf> Is this a 2D background, or a 3D plane with a fixed camera?
[2:19:32] <Mexrage> clever use of normal maps
[2:19:36] <captainthunderwolf> I always assumed it was the latter.
[2:19:36] <lankaster88> LUL
[2:19:38] <Andrei11Droasca> I thought he was Thors son the one with the sword
[2:19:39] <startadevy> xcom
[2:19:41] <+radskag> 3d w fixed camera
[2:19:42] <+Seligrafo> im having a hard time getting into the first Pillars, i loved Baldur's Gate as a kid but idk why I'm having a hard time with this one.
[2:19:51] <startadevy> :)
[2:19:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's easy: you just put one 2d image on top of another one. And another. And another! And so on
[2:20:01] <Mexrage> nope, backgrounds is a 2D image @radskag

[2:20:24] <captainthunderwolf> @Seligrafo The art's kind of jank, you really only like Eder as a character, the combat's a bit arcane and is rarely as satisfying as you expect?
[2:20:24] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> octoGun KAPOW doodBeamL doodBeam
[2:20:25] <ToneBacas> the whole thing is 2D. this is a screen Kappa

[2:20:48] <captainthunderwolf> @Seligrafo And most of the unique weapons are boring and none of the armor looks very cool?
[2:20:48] <+radskag> PUT ON COAT
[2:20:50] <acridPaladin> Pirate Gun Wizard Goblin Dwarf
[2:20:53] <+radskag> YEAAAH

[2:21:45] <+radskag> noice
[2:21:51] <Cleverspambot> saints armor too good
[2:21:57] <+radskag> eders ur bitch regardless
[2:22:02] <+radskag> love him
[2:22:03] <+shinpete> admiralPleb
[2:22:10] <startadevy> Thanos
[2:22:23] <%jiin6> so the skill is numbered
[2:22:24] <captainthunderwolf> @Seligrafo What I recommend, if you want the game to not get boring, is to NOT focus on side quests over main story until you reach the town First Fires, because the game is balanced so you will get overleveled fast. Also, you have the White March DLCs?
[2:22:26] <%Pendragwn> It's like Pathfinder/D&D
[2:22:29] <+Manbearpigbear> vancian spell casting is metal, magic is so strong it rips itself from your head
[2:22:41] <startadevy> VoteYea VoteNay VoteYea VoteNay
[2:22:43] <Cleverspambot> pillars 1 wasnt technically vancian because there were no spell slots
[2:22:58] <startadevy> congratulations
[2:23:02] <@thenefftw> Big Power Level
[2:23:03] <ToneBacas> just like some advanced math stuff. you study that shit for the exam, but you can't seem to remember it afterwards
[2:23:04] <+timblenaut> spontaneous casting is a thing in DnD as well, casting from a pool of known spells
[2:23:07] <Mexrage> 5e spell slots are still daily based, but you don't forget spells when you cast them
[2:23:09] <Stol3nheart> Isn't that just ds1 spells?
[2:23:09] <+radskag> empower will restore some slots
[2:23:10] <Daxalog> Also spells are cast at a fixed power level. Sometimes. So you cant make a fireball. Only a world ending one. Which can lead to real !!FUN!!
[2:23:13] <Andrei11Droasca> Am I rong to say that Eder is just more interesting Kart?
[2:23:33] <+radskag> eder is best boy
[2:23:35] <captainthunderwolf> Eder is a more interesting Carth, yes.
[2:23:39] <captainthunderwolf> Because he bitches less.
[2:23:40] <Daxalog> Edar has escaped the Karth chart
[2:23:42] <captainthunderwolf> And he's sassy.
[2:23:44] <%SneakyPenguin77> Eder is best boy
[2:23:48] <+Meiou> everyones more interesting that carth
[2:23:55] <+radskag> ui is so goood
[2:23:55] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Where does Eder sit on the Carth Chart?
[2:24:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Meiou True
[2:24:08] <captainthunderwolf> Eder has the balls to tell you he's the main character when he sees you come back from death.
[2:24:11] <Cleverspambot> kotor 2 carth was really cool
[2:24:11] <captainthunderwolf> He's the BEST.
[2:24:12] <Mexrage> PoE1 remake on PoE2 engine would be great
[2:24:13] <+radskag> eders more handsome n funny
[2:24:26] <captainthunderwolf> @Mexrage Oh god, you're so right.
[2:24:27] <%jiin6> Eder uses his smoke pipe as a make shift water breathing set
[2:24:28] <sponsoredviewer910> carth is the jar jar of kotor
[2:24:30] <blackwolf4567> !uptime
[2:24:30] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 24m 39s.
[2:24:42] <jacknerik> how do your guns sill work after swimming?
[2:24:43] <%jiin6> Aussie PIRATE
[2:24:43] <+JoeStillLife> Yes

[2:24:51] <BestTeaMaker> yes
[2:24:53] <+radskag> ghooosst
[2:24:53] <Cleverspambot> just not all narration text
[2:24:53] <TioXyco> YES!
[2:24:53] <+Caridinn> Hot damn
[2:24:54] <xiccy> Laura?
[2:24:54] <blackorchidKI2> Man can I not stand Pat's character's idle animation.
[2:24:56] <+mcjimbo12> wasn't all of it in pillars?
[2:24:57] <+shinpete> Fully Voiced is so much better
[2:24:57] <Mexrage> yes, everything is voiced now
[2:24:58] <+radskag> ghost gang
[2:24:58] <Andrei11Droasca> Wut all of it?
[2:25:01] <+nightw0lf174> that bailey i hear?
[2:25:01] <startadevy> grind
[2:25:01] <ToneBacas> all the lines Kreygasm
[2:25:03] <Sunstalker> YES IT WAS BIG NEWS PAT

[2:25:06] <+radskag> ALL DIALOGUE BABEY
[2:25:11] <%jiin6> but is your lines Voiced?
[2:25:13] <dkthefriend> Supposedly, yeah
[2:25:17] <startadevy> vaca
[2:25:17] <BestTeaMaker> that is a lot of dialogue
[2:25:17] <+shinpete> Does this game also have a co-op option? That would be the bee's knees
[2:25:18] <andreslazo8> That's a lot of money spent on VAs
[2:25:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> MORE VA THAN PERSONA
[2:25:22] <blackorchidKI2> Except for the narrator at times
[2:25:23] <Jakeofalco> get on divinity's level
[2:25:24] <+TeethMuncher> never before seen voice acting
[2:25:24] <captainthunderwolf> @jacknerik It's implied that guns work on slightly different rules, potentially magical, because Magran, goddess of war and fire, blesses firearms.
[2:25:24] <Sunstalker> Because Divinity showed them up
[2:25:27] <Cleverspambot> it was also decided after the game was written so no concessions were made for it
[2:25:27] <%jiin6> READ IT THO
[2:25:29] <sponsoredviewer910> reading is hard
[2:25:33] <+CptCorallis> I doubt it will stick like that in big cities
[2:25:34] <+mcjimbo12> They made a STUPID amount of money in crowdfunding
[2:25:36] <+PalmtopNami> Yes
[2:25:36] <%jiin6> do the reading
[2:25:38] <suikudo> I am begging you to stream this
[2:25:38] <+radskag> they rly pushed for it
[2:25:40] <drakthebest> STREAM THE WHOLE GAME DO IT
[2:25:41] <suikudo> YES
[2:25:42] <%commanderclaw> Just most of the non critical narration
[2:25:45] <captainthunderwolf> YES
[2:25:47] <@thenefftw> YEYEYE
[2:25:49] <+PalmtopNami> YESS
[2:25:49] <Reckless_Rob> Perhaps....

[2:29:50] <startadevy> JUMP
[2:29:52] <ragasquid> it looks the same
[2:29:59] <GarbageQueenEllie> Is there a ghost harem anime?
[2:30:05] <Mexrage> The shadows also looks much better
[2:30:10] <Cleverspambot> ease of play and making the graphics rad were a big priority for them
[2:30:16] <MelBrooksKA> I think Patron is the last person I would trust with a gun now that I think about it
[2:30:25] <+radskag> get more ghost
[2:30:25] <%TheSniperJoe> Is Pillars II a direct sequel? I never finished the first one. Do I need to blast through that before I pick this up?
[2:30:28] <kylejefferies> What did I just walk in on?
[2:30:29] <deliciouspies> @Wistelligence if you do make what pat was talking about, you could had that pat face onto it after you finished it as a second image
[2:30:36] <$TheNeedlesD> Acquire Ghost Harem
[2:30:36] <Mexrage> enviorement no longer feel disconnected from the characters
[2:30:38] <deliciouspies> add i mean
[2:30:40] <captainthunderwolf> For the record, if no one else has noticed, this is a very different sort of interaction with ghosts than you had in the first game.
[2:30:41] <Superdandy96> I know Pat has talked positively about the classic Fallout games, but has he ever streamed them? Did I miss it?
[2:30:46] <%jiin6> yes
[2:30:47] <startadevy> ディス

[2:30:53] <%TheSniperJoe> @SirWumpyFlump VoHiYo
[2:30:54] <spacehouse> Gengar used nightmare
[2:30:58] <captainthunderwolf> The first game had a lot of fulfilling the actions of the ghosts' memories as opposed to speaking to them.
[2:30:59] <+IllusionKiller522> gotta reap em all
[2:31:00] <Andrei11Droasca> Well just saying they could shrink there hole and turn your dick into pasta
[2:31:00] <%ToxInjection> Ghost Gun Gang

[2:31:08] <+radskag> yup!
[2:31:09] <captainthunderwolf> In this game there's more of a focus on spirits as characters.
[2:31:09] <kylejefferies> Ghost Maatera.
[2:31:10] <count_bob> Literally ghost farts.
[2:31:10] <$TheNeedlesD> You've done that before, in DBZ streams @AngriestPat

[2:31:42] <captainthunderwolf> @TheSniperJoe I recommend playing it, but you certainly don't have to. It IS a very direct sequel, though.

[2:34:28] <captainthunderwolf> TWO GUNS
[2:34:28] <andreslazo8> Hah
[2:34:32] <Andrei11Droasca> Just close your eyes and click

[2:34:40] <ToneBacas> passives might be a given
[2:34:47] <Lee_The_Limey> When do you unlock penis of the infinite tho? Kappa
[2:34:48] <+Burger_Bonanza> No you do not get all of those
[2:34:49] <+radskag> MORE GUN
[2:34:50] <captainthunderwolf> Eldritch Aim would be real good for GUN GANG, by the way.
[2:34:57] <Nitsuj293> fan o flames
[2:34:59] <Cleverspambot> yeah eldrich aim imo
[2:35:02] <+radskag> no u pick which ones
[2:35:06] <patr1ckly> Where's the spell that gives me more guns.
[2:35:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> You don't get all of them, you can use whatever ones are in your books, but you can only assign the ones you know to books.
[2:35:26] <+oAlec687> Find yourself a woman that looks at you the way Pat looks at skill trees LUL
[2:35:28] <startadevy> making a neo-nazi is always rough
[2:35:36] <ToneBacas> this is me at any fastfood joint, guys. i don't know what to pick when i'm on the spot WutFace
[2:35:39] <deliciouspies> fire though
[2:35:44] <startadevy> heyy
[2:35:53] <+radskag> ghost blades maybe?
[2:36:06] <deliciouspies> with oil slick, fire is a good pick
[2:36:06] <axelkaspar> I want to see Pat's reaction to Path of Exile's skill tree
[2:36:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> GUNCHI GANG GUNCHI GANG GUNCHI GANG GUNCHI GANG GUNCHI GANG GUNCHI GANG
[2:36:13] <Cleverspambot> imma make aloth a fighter wizard and script him to self buff at the start of every fight and go buck wild
[2:36:19] <%jiin6> i'd scream even if you were right
[2:36:23] <+Burger_Bonanza> Why would you choose to not increase your number of available spells
[2:36:24] <captainthunderwolf> You mean Path of Exile's fucking skill MAP that goes on forever?
[2:36:26] <deliciouspies> idk
[2:36:26] <captainthunderwolf> Oh, man.
[2:36:27] <kylejefferies> Pat missed a Donation
[2:36:30] <SatansDick1> ghost blade tho
[2:36:31] <deliciouspies> I'm just shouting
[2:36:35] <+Meiou> you scream we scream you know eveyrone screams.
[2:36:46] <Hispanacomida25> But why he scream
[2:36:47] <+wreckinize> i would think it would
[2:36:48] <DonatelloJose> Pat, the game isn't out yet. how is anyone going to scream at you?
[2:36:50] <+wreckinize> but idk
[2:37:04] <Cleverspambot> because we know this game better than him clearly
[2:37:08] <InsomniacPersona> Double the guns
[2:37:09] <+radskag> well hey u can always respec if u mess up
[2:37:10] <+Burger_Bonanza> I'm saying picking a spell that's in your grimoire is a bad choice for dummies
[2:37:15] <startadevy> END GAME
[2:37:20] <Cleverspambot> yeah respec is still pretty cheap
[2:37:21] <+Burger_Bonanza> you gain nothing!
[2:37:21] <Daxalog> You can still kinda pick up on things from seenig it
[2:37:22] <inderf> dont you know some of those cuz of your book?
[2:37:26] <+radskag> no biggie
[2:37:30] <startadevy> when is marvel
[2:37:31] <deliciouspies> it feels gamey to use your oil to light someone on fire all the more, but yeah if it isn't clear how that works don't
[2:37:32] <Andrei11Droasca> He screams because the sadness in his hard is true!
[2:37:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> Shao Lin Shadow Casting. And the Wu-Tang Gun style.
[2:37:43] <Cleverspambot> eh, always having missiles is solid
[2:37:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> You can't learn spells from books, only use spells from the book. I think.
[2:37:49] <+Burger_Bonanza> hooray!
[2:38:10] <+wreckinize> does that mean pat now has the power of 4 guns?
[2:38:15] <startadevy> amiloGasm
[2:38:20] <Cleverspambot> this and unique abilities are the only remaining per rest mechanics
[2:38:32] <+WaifusSansFrontieres> can we get somethin more precise than "much more powerful"?
[2:38:42] <hippofant> @WaifusSansFrontieres I think it depends on the power, so
[2:38:45] <@thenefftw> Do a big shit
[2:38:52] <startadevy> bad brains
[2:38:56] <Cleverspambot> i think it tells you if you click empower and hover over the skill
[2:39:02] <Lee_The_Limey> Considerably more powerful Kappa
[2:39:12] <+TheShal> Where's the mustard wench?
[2:39:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> Empower your butt
[2:39:18] <Andrei11Droasca> Dude wat if Goro used guns? that be broken gun teck
[2:39:22] <+radskag> empower GUN
[2:39:26] <+WaifusSansFrontieres> @hippofant I'd imagine it does, but does the game give you more accurate information for each power and how it will change when powered up?
[2:39:28] <Cleverspambot> Wizard (cowardly)
[2:40:18] <%jiin6> be the wizard that you were meant to be, Cowardly Wizard
[2:40:21] <+radskag> god im excited for this game
[2:40:26] <hippofant> @WaifusSansFrontieres That I'm not sure about. I don't have the game yet and other streamers haven't really shown me much of the empowerment system
[2:40:26] <+hawk_rush> How's Pillars 2 looking? Just got here
[2:40:44] <+WaifusSansFrontieres> have you ever met a dead cowardly wizard? I bet you havent
[2:40:56] <+KoyaMusa> pat did you just say sloshbuckler

[2:41:26] <Ser_Randal> Eder is better than you
[2:41:28] <%XzileGaming> angiest chart
[2:41:33] <Dellago> Eder can be fighter/Rogue
[2:41:33] <FriendlyPatches> it is not what im used to
[2:41:34] <ToneBacas> is this what multiclass is about?
[2:41:35] <+WaifusSansFrontieres> @hippofant fair enough, but that is the kind of mechanic I want lots of very clear numbers on
[2:41:36] <axelkaspar> Rogue+Fightboy
[2:41:37] <%bluetocho13> did i miss the Raffle?
[2:41:38] <%jiin6> i've seen many a cowardly wizard with pee stained pants, yet have seen a dead one

[2:42:28] <andreslazo8> Ah, I see.
[2:42:35] <+WaifusSansFrontieres> all joking aside wizards should be cowards
[2:42:35] <Cleverspambot> i'd have done escape just to have a mobility skill
[2:42:36] <+radskag> fuck All of it

[2:54:13] <captainthunderwolf> @MartwyPies Drink lots of water, eat something salty, have some Alka-Seltzer and a single serving of alcohol in the morning, like a beer, because hangovers are also caused by withdrawal.

[2:55:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> @commanderclaw That's way easier than other games like this. They just want you to use trial & error.

[3:00:38] <captainthunderwolf> For those in chat: Gaun is just Eothas for farmers.
[3:01:03] <+WaifusSansFrontieres> @captainthunderwolf does he offer any farming related perks?
[3:01:06] <captainthunderwolf> But he's also, like, symbolically similar to Berath, god of cycles.
[3:01:06] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> But this sounds like Fjord, so maybe this is where Travis got the voice from
[3:01:12] <+radskag> gaun is like an aspect of eothas, like the pallid knight for berath

[3:04:32] <$SGrim> DOUBLE TEAM HER WITH MAT MERCER PogChamp
[3:04:34] <+TeethMuncher> all multi-class, all the time!
[3:04:38] <captainthunderwolf> @WaifusSansFrontieres Yeah, and what I mean to say is, our clarification to explain that is: "You see, I'm a noble from a nearby land who can see ghosts and I also killed a god."
[3:04:39] <TheImmortal70> If she can't punch, fuck her, she can't have Eder
[3:04:41] <startadevy> CONTEMPLATIVE
[3:04:41] <KingOfTheGeats> make that CR team
[3:04:41] <TyrantBelial> DOOO EEEEEET
[3:04:42] <Cleverspambot> duel class for the secondary tank might be a good idea
[3:04:43] <currently_confused> Priest of FIST
[3:04:44] <TyrantBelial> DO IT NOOOW
[3:04:44] <+PalmtopNami> @AngriestPat It's laura bailey
[3:04:45] <+radskag> pure priest bc big heals
[3:04:46] <Andrei11Droasca> That's cool and all but were is mi Durance and Devil?
[3:04:47] <Stol3nheart> put punch girl in coach
[3:04:50] <TangledVirus> MONKw
[3:04:50] <%ssaryn> Punch-Priest. Let's go.
[3:04:50] <captainthunderwolf> Flat Priest is probably best.
[3:04:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> I SURE HOPE SHE DOESN'T DIE
[3:04:54] <antthefool> Make her like a Diablo monk so she can 7 sided strike Eothas dick off
[3:04:55] <startadevy> healer on the front line
[3:04:57] <startadevy> duh wizard
[3:04:59] <captainthunderwolf> COMTEMPLATIVE.
[3:05:01] <TangledVirus> Contemplative!
[3:05:05] <dirtyplebian> vontemplative
[3:05:06] <+wreckinize> BIG PUNCH
[3:05:06] <powerprotoman> monk we gotta have one deidcated punch girl
[3:05:06] <%commanderclaw> CONTEMPLATIVE
[3:05:07] <onlyglaric> Monk
[3:05:08] <%TenderBabyBacon> contemplative
[3:05:08] <%ToxInjection> Why would we argue against punching priest?
[3:05:08] <+Burger_Bonanza> her priest subclass is unique, so go for priest or contemplative IMO
[3:05:10] <TangledVirus> Dual tech all the time!
[3:05:11] <Dozale> Let's contemplate on this first!
[3:05:11] <spacehouse> THINK HARD PUNCH HARDER
[3:05:11] <Scumsave> oh man, your oarty
[3:05:13] <%ssaryn> PAT YOU BETTER LET HER BE A PUNCH-PRIEST
[3:05:13] <TheImmortal70> IF you don't want pure priest, then get contemplative
[3:05:13] <%envy_780> Contemplative, Damage plus heals
[3:05:14] <DuskPixie> PURITY PUNCH
[3:05:14] <TyrantBelial> contemplative
[3:05:16] <count_bob> Dicontempative
[3:05:17] <%ToxInjection> Punching Priest seems like the superior choice
[3:05:18] <%ssaryn> YEYEYEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[3:05:19] <TyrantBelial> self heals, heal others, tanky
[3:05:20] <Cleverspambot> her unique items rule for contemplative
[3:05:20] <+Picabunny> Just joining - is this like RPG DnD?
[3:05:20] <Scumsave> is gonna with no healer
[3:05:21] <quantras6> multiclass that shit.
[3:05:22] <StubYourToe> awww yee
[3:05:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> I think you should COMTEMPLATE IT.

[3:06:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> (sharp inhale) Nice
[3:06:06] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat If you weren't gonna go Priest on its own, it woulda been a bad idea to not get her heals either way. Comtemplative is good.
[3:06:07] <startadevy> human?
[3:06:10] <%GummiBunnies> BEST GIRL
[3:06:12] <Kavtech> A religoisicle?
[3:06:12] <%ToxInjection> Stab people. With RELIGION SwiftRage

[3:06:15] <+radskag> shes da bes
[3:06:15] <startadevy> nice
[3:06:19] <+dodge_and_dust> why are so many sickles religious?
[3:06:23] <%ssaryn> She's just a KDM character. Hot damn.
[3:06:28] <captainthunderwolf> Already we have a better girl than Pillars 1.
[3:06:28] <Kavtech> Is that like a religious popsicle?
[3:06:32] <Andrei11Droasca> She looks like the DS 2 level up lady
[3:06:33] <+PalmtopNami> Wait did Laura take elements of her for jester..or vice versa.
[3:06:45] <startadevy> universal
[3:06:46] <+radskag> best gorl
[3:06:48] <+WaifusSansFrontieres> which religion is the correct one? like, which god is real?
[3:06:50] <captainthunderwolf> He'd get fucking MERCED by enemies in the back.
[3:07:00] <captainthunderwolf> @WaifusSansFrontieres Literally all of them.
[3:07:01] <Cleverspambot> i like multiclassing cause it means everyone can get into the shit
[3:07:02] <quantras6> she seems alright, but I'd wait till Maia shows up before declaring her best girl
[3:07:08] <Tuskor13> is her VA Laura bailey
[3:07:17] <$SGrim> @WaifusSansFrontieres in the game? They're all technically both real and fake.
[3:07:20] <+mcjimbo12> @WaifusSansFrontieres They're all real. Well, the gods are actually just people from an ancient civilisation who got SUPER BIG AND STRONG
[3:07:29] <+radskag> theyre all best gorl
[3:07:32] <startadevy> daft shit
[3:07:43] <mr_slaide> I'd do her.
[3:07:44] <Cleverspambot> best girl still aloth
[3:07:49] <quantras6> @radskag THATS NOT HOW IT WORKS
[3:07:51] <Scumsave> lolol
[3:07:51] <captainthunderwolf> @WaifusSansFrontieres The gods are scientific constructs created by amassing entire civilizations into singular hive souls that can control reality.
[3:07:53] <%ToxInjection> Is this the Persona 5 of CRPGs? Kappa
[3:08:06] <+WaifusSansFrontieres> @mcjimbo12 any particular way they did that? something mystical or fantastical, or just grinded till godhood?
[3:08:13] <Dozale> Personas of Eternity
[3:08:20] <Cleverspambot> 120 slash
[3:08:25] <startadevy> Persona 5 does not count, because Persona 5
[3:08:25] <%ssaryn> WAOW
[3:08:27] <captainthunderwolf> @WaifusSansFrontieres Melted people with a soul machine, stole the life energy of millions.
[3:08:28] <Shinmaddrox> So how much of this stream has been pat looking at menus?
[3:08:30] <Cleverspambot> that will one shot your whole party atm
[3:08:39] <+mcjimbo12> @WaifusSansFrontieres I forget. I think they ate a bunch of souls or something. They all have like specific "things" they're gods of, kinda like the greek pantheon GOWKratos
[3:08:40] <+WaifusSansFrontieres> I do dig soul melting
[3:08:40] <startadevy> KonCha
[3:08:43] <+radskag> pillars IS looking at menus
[3:08:46] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> That's a lotta damage
[3:08:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> Everyone in your party so far has massive sex appeal. I am pleased with this
[3:09:02] <Andrei11Droasca> @toxinjection Well it's good so no
[3:09:03] <startadevy> TPFufun
[3:09:05] <captainthunderwolf> @mcjimbo12 Big Adra towers fucking ashed everyone and ate their lives.
[3:09:08] <deliciouspies> is this the FF tactics of... what genre is Pillars?
[3:09:08] <quantras6> i really glad they fixed up the portraits before launch. the first ones they showed didn't look that great.
[3:09:10] <FrostMass22> @garbagequeenellie even Patron?
[3:09:14] <deliciouspies> lot of skills ot learn
[3:09:14] <Dozale> Let's hatch that idea
[3:09:17] <%ssaryn> Is her Lantern just a punch basically...?
[3:09:21] <startadevy> GOWKratos
[3:09:21] <+WaifusSansFrontieres> can we mod this to add more menus?
[3:09:23] <Tuskor13> Who's her voice actress tho
[3:09:24] <+radskag> all ur companions in pillars 2 are Hawt tbh
[3:09:26] <$SGrim> Monk fists? Kreygasm
[3:09:26] <Wistelligence> romantic rubber monk fist
[3:09:28] <proof_plus> woo I made it
[3:09:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> @FrostMass22 Ehhh, I bet there's a market for it.
[3:09:30] <Andrei11Droasca> Waiting for it
[3:09:31] <+wreckinize> GO all in on the punch
[3:09:40] <quantras6> @tuskor13 Laura bailey doinh a southern accent
[3:09:40] <Cleverspambot> fists will do more damage atm but her unique weapons have solid enchant
[3:09:44] <%ToxInjection> Gotta split windows so we can micromanage menus while micromanaging menus
[3:09:45] <captainthunderwolf> @GarbageQueenEllie Paige is literally that market.
[3:09:57] <KTDelgado> PAT YOU FUCK LEARN TO PISS NORMALLY
[3:09:59] <TyrantBelial> Oh she needs a empty arms set
[3:10:00] <%Mistheart101> What's up everyone I'm late and I have semi-exploded cheese sticks
[3:10:03] <TyrantBelial> so she can use unarmed abilities
[3:10:07] <Cleverspambot> back and prone
[3:10:07] <+mcjimbo12> I really like how you can choose your party's class. I hated picking a fighter and being unable to quest with Eder because double fighter was trash
[3:10:10] <startadevy> SeemsGood cucked by now am i right
[3:10:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> @captainthunderwolf Which means our sex appeal ratio is at its all time high. Excellent!
[3:10:18] <captainthunderwolf> The basic compromise with Monks is that they have extremely high attack speed, but the tradeoff is not getting to use enchanted weapons.
[3:10:19] <Tuskor13> Wait. If Laura Bailey and Chrom have a romance going on....
[3:10:23] <startadevy> cuckhold
[3:10:25] <Tuskor13> Chrom X Lucina
[3:10:27] <Dozale> Damn, I was set on single class but multiclass is so cool...
[3:10:27] <captainthunderwolf> Azzon me.
[3:10:33] <deliciouspies> !uptime
[3:10:33] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 10m 41s.
[3:10:36] <TyrantBelial> @AngriestPat xoti needs an empty arms set so she can used monk fist attacks
[3:10:40] <Tuskor13> omg I said Laura Bailey and chrom
[3:10:42] <@thenefftw> Oh, I'll keep my eyes on you, girl
[3:10:44] <%ssaryn> SHE'S SO COOL LOOKING.
[3:10:46] <Tuskor13> I meant Matt mercer
[3:10:46] <startadevy> she looked like a pirate
[3:10:47] <Dozale> SHODEY
[3:10:53] <+radskag> shes gr8
[3:10:53] <TheImmortal70> *ahem SHAWTY *ahem
[3:10:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yea now she can fist you super hard and deep
[3:11:06] <TheImmortal70> Yes
[3:11:06] <+Burger_Bonanza> Monks don't HAVE to use fists, she's fine as she is
[3:11:09] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Bare-handed, see. Because they get barehanded specific damage and attack speed buffs.
[3:11:12] <KTDelgado> so shes a fister?
[3:11:14] <whatatkins> @AngriestPat Would you recommend Pillars 1 to someone new to CRPG's?
[3:11:15] <quantras6> @mcjimbo12 same. watched someone streaming yesterday and Serafen looked pretty dope. thankfully i can make him a Barbarian instead of a cipher
[3:11:16] <hippofant> Monks can use weapons. They just get stuff for if they're fisting.
[3:11:19] <Cleverspambot> fists only fall off late game, when enchants get silly, if its like the first one
[3:11:22] <Dozale> Nah, PoE doesn't have wepaon restrictions
[3:11:34] <%commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Monks can use weapons, but they have pretty good fists
[3:11:43] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat I'm speaking from a design perspective, just that the balance comes from trading enchanted perks for raw DPS.
[3:11:44] <startadevy> rock and roll
[3:11:45] <Cleverspambot> yeah, something might be immune to slash
[3:11:46] <anAngryHamster> The best thing about Monks is that they get time stop.
[3:11:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> She's basically Belladona now
[3:11:53] <StubYourToe> lol
[3:12:15] <captainthunderwolf> Woah, TALKING in an RPG
[3:12:18] <%ssaryn> Welp.
[3:12:18] <deliciouspies> the belladona bitch fists come in a pack of 4 though @GarbageQueenEllie
[3:12:20] <captainthunderwolf> This sequel has it all
[3:12:21] <%commanderclaw> @captainthunderwolf Yeah, but you can use their buffs with weapons too
[3:12:23] <%ssaryn> We know Aloth is gonna be in this game now.
[3:12:29] <%ssaryn> WAIT WHAT IS THIS
[3:12:33] <+radskag> ederrrrr
[3:12:36] <deviljhojho94> holy shit
[3:12:36] <Cleverspambot> you can duplicate items in weapon sets in this one, like having the lantern in the offhand of both sets by clicking the top right of the icon
[3:12:39] <young_sn0w> Pat as your psychologist I demand you stop drinking Red Bull
[3:12:39] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Big tutorial spoils

[3:13:31] <Daxalog> He like animal
[3:13:34] <%commanderclaw> @captainthunderwolf You should use fists for crush damage, but for slash or pierce, just use a different weapon
[3:13:36] <etalmeta> @WaifusSansFrontieres you misunderstand, she doesn't like people hating on her religion
[3:13:36] <deliciouspies> @GarbageQueenEllie I'm about 90% sure, but the last time I looked them up was like, years ago when I'd send them in tiny url to a girl I knew in highschool
[3:13:41] <%ToxInjection> ChillGunGang

[3:14:11] <%ToxInjection> So now you need a HYPEGunGang
[3:14:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> Animals and guns, sometimes magic. NO KEYS.
[3:14:15] <quantras6> @mightymaxt or Orlans

[3:14:42] <captainthunderwolf> @commanderclaw What I mean is, in Pillars 1, the ideal Monk DPS build was bare-handed with gloves and items that boost per-hit bare-handed damage above where pretty much any other class would go.
[3:14:44] <%Ninestempest> A THOT's got a THIRST

[3:25:14] <+Meiou> you got any new guns lady?

[3:26:07] <CatmanIX> @Mistheart101 they're over any "combined" sounds like "st" and "ch", i assume it's to indicate they're represented by a single character in whatever native alphabet they use?

[3:26:46] <Cleverspambot> you will end up respeccing to not have any of the spells your final spellbook has anyway

[3:31:11] <deviljhojho94> maybe both of your starter companions being religious means a change of theme contrasting the past game? Last game gods were cunts.

[3:35:23] <+radskag> have u checked
[3:35:33] <Wistelligence> Every 20 minutes, stare at an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds.
[3:35:35] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat so every 20 minutes, you look at something 20 feet away, for 20 seconds. It helps with eye health while using screens.
[3:35:35] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Where's Shellmo
[3:35:35] <Wistelligence> It's an eyesight thing.
[3:35:36] <$rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat got any advice for someone who wants to play pillars but never played a crpg before?

[4:01:02] <wsintai> @Zombrocom I bet he'd be more embarrassed if he had a knife in his arm
[4:01:04] <hazardkujacker> @theangryguyofde But I wanted escalation into gun violence
[4:01:19] <Happyguyelite> Hows the game Pat
[4:01:22] <+Meiou> @theangryguyofde but its a fight in a bar. doesnt that make it a bar fight?
[4:01:35] <deliciouspies> oh you can do "something" in here I bet
[4:01:47] <dkthefriend> It's an inn, pat
[4:01:48] <goatsaregoat> you have to buy the room from him now
[4:01:49] <Dozale> talk to the inkeep
[4:01:52] <17sevens> You didn't actually ask for the room
[4:01:54] <+radskag> u gotta talk to the bartender
[4:02:00] <PulverKong> @Meiou but you're not supposed to kill or maim people in a bar fight just brawl with them
[4:02:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> Close the door, Pat!
[4:02:09] <theangryguyofde> @meiou but if it starts above a bar... how does it escalate?
[4:02:13] <IminyourBase> he said he'd give it to you at a discount
[4:02:16] <%ssaryn> 43 Coins ain't too bad though.
[4:02:17] <startadevy> dank meme art
[4:02:19] <goatsaregoat> I'm totally going to stab him in the arm on my playthrough
[4:02:23] <Valask> you have 17 hundred pat

[4:04:04] <+LogothX> Your party is cool with you rummaging around his yard stealing berries
[4:04:12] <Bouldus> @quantras6 so, im not entirely sure its only aloth, him leaving and replacing the BBG i think is based off your choices with him but animacny is him or its the female big blue lady, I THINK i cant quite remember, but yea theres a it should be taught so we can understand it ending
[4:04:15] <@thenefftw> Twitch lagged out for me while Pat was finding out what happened to Rinco. What went on?
[4:04:29] <Valask> nothing
[4:04:40] <Valask> standard idling response
[4:04:43] <wsintai> @thenefftw We didnt stab a guy, then we stole berries and shit

[4:04:47] <lankaster88> Actually nothing
[4:04:50] <IminyourBase> put a hat on your hat
[4:04:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> @LogothX That's petty theft. They don't like stealing VALUABLE shit.
[4:04:55] <deliciouspies> I think Rinco was just like "ye I got my shit pushed it"
[4:04:59] <+radskag> more hatttt
[4:05:07] <@thenefftw> No, I mean what did the bartender say about it?

[4:17:58] <@thenefftw> @deliciouspies Yes
[4:18:00] <captainthunderwolf> Combusting Wounds was a real letdown in the last game.

[4:23:34] <lautalocos> she can see ghosts?
[4:23:39] <deliciouspies> yes she can
[4:23:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> I hope she does last rites by twerking around in a dance like in FFX
[4:23:49] <StubYourToe> shes special
[4:23:50] <ghostpalacio> big loots
[4:23:58] <d3adlyfr0g> RAWR

[4:25:01] <ghostpalacio> ah yeah hard tack the meal of champs
[4:25:07] <StubYourToe> its basically ratioms
[4:25:12] <deliciouspies> hard tack can heal any wound!
[4:25:12] <StubYourToe> rations
[4:25:12] <captainthunderwolf> In the old campfire, you can see the layers where the animations intersect.
[4:25:13] <@thenefftw> They were looters
[4:25:21] <$Chimeraelite> better than salt pork
[4:25:33] <$Chimeraelite> I'd take hard tack and jerky anyday
[4:25:36] <%jiin6> killing them cause there's too much Water
[4:25:36] <startadevy> ready player 1 was the best
[4:25:38] <Bouldus> that dude had a rifle

[4:25:51] <GarbageQueenEllie> WE IN NAM, BOYOS
[4:25:54] <Majiinbooh> Lol those walk animations are sad
[4:26:01] <captainthunderwolf> @Beerswithbears Funny you should ask
[4:26:10] <deliciouspies> oh she CAN'T see them
[4:26:10] <%jiin6> one toilets flooding the entire District
[4:26:18] <startadevy> too much information
[4:26:22] <deviljhojho94> qt accent ghost
[4:26:24] <startadevy> ass
[4:26:26] <+radskag> i think she can just sense them?
[4:26:29] <Bouldus> maybe dont jiggle the soul jar
[4:26:34] <startadevy> MrDestructoid
[4:26:38] <$SGrim> Xoti's doing it with you... Kreygasm
[4:26:45] <Dozale> She's full of shit!
[4:26:49] <ghostpalacio> darkness
[4:26:56] <startadevy> 2
[4:26:57] <+radskag> spoilers xoti jesus
[4:27:14] <captainthunderwolf> Eder's like, "Good shit, my god IS dead."
[4:27:26] <+radskag> he LOVES it
[4:27:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> @radskag She has to obtain the Final Aeon and bring about the Calm
[4:27:51] <goatsaregoat> Is Durance is PoE 2
[4:27:52] <automata93> Yo this looks good
[4:28:02] <%jiin6> so question, What does a End Of Financial Year Sale have anything to do with gods?
[4:28:02] <deviljhojho94> "i sure wish my god was alive"
[4:28:12] <deliciouspies> I hope the final Aeon here is a 4 pack of Belladona bitch fists
[4:28:19] <PulverKong> that palm tree is twitching tho
[4:28:25] <captainthunderwolf> In other words, she worships the darker side of Eothas and is thus a foil to Eder.
[4:28:30] <deviljhojho94> there surely is a god of finance
[4:28:30] <captainthunderwolf> And a foil to Durance.
[4:28:33] <captainthunderwolf> I like this.
[4:28:44] <Daxalog> What shes saying is so weird considering the truth
[4:28:45] <$Chimeraelite> Lore is hot
[4:28:52] <Fynale> what does pat mean when he says the gods in this world are "manufactured" does taht mean they're fake?
[4:28:54] <deviljhojho94> LUL
[4:28:55] <Daxalog> "Necking"?
[4:28:56] <Dozale> Durance went to find a home for his other staff, ain't came back.
[4:29:00] <%Pendragwn> I bet she uses a hard r
[4:29:04] <startadevy> smoke weed?
[4:29:11] <Daxalog> erryday?
[4:29:12] <%jiin6> she getting High?
[4:29:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Fynale They're former mortals who have ascended, basically.
[4:29:14] <captainthunderwolf> @Fynale It's, uh, big spoiler for the first game. Wanna hear?
[4:29:20] <deviljhojho94> She is so high
[4:29:22] <$Chimeraelite> I like this gal
[4:29:24] <+radskag> the gods basically arent the creators of the world but they Are super powerful beings
[4:29:31] <Fynale> got it just wanted to know if they actually had power
[4:29:32] <captainthunderwolf> Remember kids, everyone in Pillars does drugs.
[4:29:38] <startadevy> douche on
[4:29:45] <deviljhojho94> monks are actually junkies on the pillars setting
[4:29:47] <captainthunderwolf> Drinking booze is weird in this world, but drugs are super commonplace.
[4:29:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Fynale They've got big power. Very strong.
[4:29:57] <Lee_The_Limey> Eder...Did the priest touch your Eothas?
[4:30:04] <lankaster88> He's a hero for fun
[4:30:08] <captainthunderwolf> @deviljhojho94 One of the Monk subclasses literally gets buffs when intoxicated.
[4:30:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> Why don't you come with me, lil girl. On a magic carpet ride
[4:30:32] <Too_Much_Nukie> The monks are all about getting stronger when debuffed/wounded, at least in Pillars 1.
[4:30:37] <deviljhojho94> @captainthunderwolf boy i sure hope i win the raffle cuz i now really want to play this
[4:30:40] <Dozale> a month or two later
[4:31:07] <startadevy> city of heroes
[4:31:10] <deviljhojho94> Reminds me of the good ol' peyote monks back in San Luis Potosi
[4:31:36] <+radskag> dialogue unlocks as u progress
[4:31:37] <startadevy> company of hereos
[4:31:41] <%jiin6> Drown in the poo poo water
[4:31:42] <Too_Much_Nukie> I appreciate doling out the companion talks over time rather than dumping them all at once.
[4:31:51] <Scumsave> i need a better comp for this
[4:31:57] <startadevy> conglomerate
[4:31:57] <deviljhojho94> kill this goober

[4:32:02] <hazardkujacker> @deviljhojho94 nothing like SLP's peyote monks
[4:32:03] <+radskag> less lore dumpy
[4:32:18] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Mafia man
[4:32:19] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Too_Much_Nukie It makes you feel like you're progressing in your relationships with the characters.
[4:32:22] <%jiin6> SHOW HIM A CUT WITH A GUN
[4:32:22] <%anticrust> @AngriestPat What level do you start at in this?
[4:32:33] <+radskag> what a dick
[4:32:35] <Lee_The_Limey> 3
[4:32:36] <deviljhojho94> @hazardkujacker dunno man, one of the monks I saw was jacked. Bet he could kick some ass
[4:32:38] <Too_Much_Nukie> @GarbageQueenEllie Exactly. Like the adventures you've had have formed a bond.
[4:32:41] <Thenuclearwalrus> moon2N
[4:32:53] <deviljhojho94> shoulda killed this goober tbh

[4:51:46] <strangelee> THAT MERCHANT LACKS HONOR
[4:51:48] <Dozale> attacking her means attacking the whole village

[4:51:53] <goatsaregoat> cultural differences
[4:51:57] <ArcticAsylum> is it?????
[4:51:59] <$rdark_ksu> good
[4:52:08] <%ssaryn> She did alright. She can see reason./
[4:52:08] <%Mrdoctorprofessorhipster> Step 5: Recieve Restraining Order in the mail. Congratulations, you've won your relationship!
[4:52:09] <lankaster88> Right choice
[4:52:15] <TheImmortal70> I mean it's not like she needed the money, so that's fine I guess.
[4:52:20] <dkthefriend> Listen, don't call a klingon their equivalent of the n-word
[4:52:24] <captainthunderwolf> In case anyone in chat hasn't realized, Aumaua are 7 foot tall shark Hawaiians.
[4:52:25] <goatsaregoat> ha
[4:52:26] <Lee_The_Limey> To be fair I'd have killed her
[4:52:32] <StubYourToe> !uptime
[4:52:32] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 52m 41s.
[4:52:37] <antthefool> YOU HAVE NO HONOR
[4:52:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> @captainthunderwolf That's rad
[4:52:38] <$SGrim> Noone here to guard your shit. That just means it's free LUL
[4:52:42] <strangelee> To be fair, she's in the right
[4:52:43] <+KoyaMusa> to be fair you're insane
[4:52:48] <deviljhojho94> CRINGE QUEEN
[4:52:48] <ArcticAsylum> AWWWW

[4:53:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> Eder really wants to die alone, huh?
[4:53:26] <captainthunderwolf> IS EDER SHUTTING HER DOWN BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T KNOW HE'S AN ATHEIST????
[4:53:26] <YuDread> "you have nothing to tell me" -Eder unsSmile
[4:53:30] <ArcticAsylum> BE NICE TO VVYMEN EDER
[4:53:30] <deliciouspies> I think he's allowed to shut down peopel he don't wanna get involved with
[4:53:32] <goatsaregoat> nuked the poor girl from orbit
[4:53:32] <captainthunderwolf> IS THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?
[4:53:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> @captainthunderwolf Yes.
[4:53:35] <Lee_The_Limey> Blown the fuck out
[4:53:37] <Ser_Randal> Patron the Creepy Dwarf Gun Mage
[4:53:39] <$Chimeraelite> TALK
[4:53:40] <captainthunderwolf> THAT'S THE BEST
[4:53:41] <antthefool> Eder don’t put up with these THOTS
[4:53:41] <something_very_clever> Destroyed utterly
[4:53:42] <quantras6> XOTI BTFO
[4:53:43] <KTDelgado> FUCK ONDRA
[4:53:44] <deviljhojho94> sorry i dont date religious chicks
[4:53:45] <$Chimeraelite> Use thine words
[4:53:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> She reminds Eder too much of when he was stupid and worshipped the gods.
[4:53:55] <quantras6> HOW WILL SHE EVER RECOVER
[4:53:57] <StubYourToe> hes good looking enough to get away with that
[4:54:13] <captainthunderwolf> KAHANGA ALSO SOUNDS SILLY
[4:54:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> On the other hand, Xoti's still single. Mission accomlished!
[4:54:16] <$Chimeraelite> I don't entirely blame him...but
[4:54:18] <ArcticAsylum> Mission failed, we'll get em next time
[4:54:23] <KTDelgado> ondras a cunt
[4:54:27] <startadevy> a vagina is big?
[4:54:31] <quantras6> @too_much_nukie plus isn't he a good bit older then her.
[4:54:31] <deviljhojho94> you should seduce eder instead pat
[4:54:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> @quantras6 Yeah but that ain't a thang in this setting.
[4:54:49] <$thewalrusx> @AngriestPat Paige didn't want to co-op this game with you?
[4:54:56] <StubYourToe> is there a gay romance options in this game?
[4:54:57] <quantras6> @ktdelgado Abydon a best
[4:55:03] <ArcticAsylum> PAT FUCK EDER TO SHOW DOMINANCE
[4:55:04] <Ser_Randal> Eothas is a bitch fuck redemption
[4:55:13] <TheImmortal70> Stupid eothas, flooding a town after killing 322 some people and stepping on you
[4:55:25] <@PeachSaliva> @thewalrusx he didn’t invite me :(
[4:55:27] <deviljhojho94> those people are redeemed now
[4:55:29] <quantras6> @stubyourtoe supposedly the orlan Serafen hits on dudes. cant confirm that for sure though.
[4:55:31] <deliciouspies> still worship him tho
[4:55:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> @StubYourToe I thought during the fig campaign for this game they mentioned romance options for the MC, male and female options regardless of gender.
[4:55:38] <strangelee> Did Pat never talk to the barman about these two?
[4:55:39] <captainthunderwolf> @Too_Much_Nukie I dunno, I could see a weathered farmhand like Eder not wanting to date some chick who's like 20 after going to war and seeing his god killed and all.
[4:55:39] <goatsaregoat> Magran is a true man's god
[4:55:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> But I could be wrong.
[4:55:46] <deviljhojho94> killing someone is a way to redeem them so all the inoccents that died in the flood are in a better place now
[4:55:47] <Archaveil> what an asshole
[4:55:48] <deliciouspies> somethine something divine retribution
[4:55:50] <Archaveil> kick his ass
[4:55:53] <+Flambage> @PeachSaliva Go kick down his door and invite yourself!
[4:55:55] <StubYourToe> @quantras6 thx man
[4:55:57] <deviljhojho94> FUCK THE VALIANS
[4:55:58] <ArcticAsylum> dude...come on
[4:55:59] <quantras6> @goatsaregoat WHORE
[4:56:01] <+KoyaMusa> @PeachSaliva paige you would have just said the game is boring like last time anyways
[4:56:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> Tell Xoti to use the Bitchfist
[4:56:01] <Ser_Randal> 4
[4:56:02] <Too_Much_Nukie> @captainthunderwolf Yeah it's not really about age. Eder has seen too much and she's all naive and hopeful.
[4:56:06] <Lee_The_Limey> Rinco you shit
[4:56:14] <ArcticAsylum> Wooooow
[4:56:20] <captainthunderwolf> I don't really like having open romance options regardless of gender, because it turns the characters into essentially sex objects.
[4:56:21] <Lee_The_Limey> Jesus
[4:56:22] <quantras6> @stubyourtoe Tekehu is likely bi as well
[4:56:23] <strangelee> Fuck this guy
[4:56:24] <@PeachSaliva> @koyamusa yeah, to rile up Pat. Duh.
[4:56:31] <captainthunderwolf> I was always a fan of the "several bisexuals available" model.
[4:56:32] <ArcticAsylum> FUCK YOU MAN
[4:56:34] <Bouldus> hey Paige @PeachSaliva o/
[4:56:37] <deviljhojho94> This guy is a cunt too
[4:56:37] <%ssaryn> YOU HAVE YOUR MONEY AND A LIVING BITCH
[4:56:39] <captainthunderwolf> Like Dragon Age, for instance.
[4:56:41] <shimapanhero> Rinco is being a bitch about it.
[4:56:43] <Lee_The_Limey> OH MY GOD STAB HIM
[4:56:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> "May X feast upon your eyes" is such a good insult.
[4:56:46] <lankaster88> Everybody hates Rinco
[4:56:52] <ArcticAsylum> KILL EM ALL PAT
[4:56:52] <Strideral> Cunts of Eternity
[4:56:54] <Ser_Randal> wooooooooooooooo
[4:56:57] <strangelee> Stab him now
[4:56:57] <StubYourToe> @quantras6 noice
[4:56:58] <deviljhojho94> NOW STEAL
[4:57:03] <Dellago> Damn 1000 coins was a fraction of what he had? Wonder how much in full there was
[4:57:03] <Dozale> dumdum
[4:57:08] <Ser_Randal> XOTI ITS YA BIRTHDAY
[4:57:09] <antthefool> Rip off his other ear
[4:57:17] <captainthunderwolf> @Too_Much_Nukie "May DMX feast on your eyes," is definitely how I interpreted that, and it's definitely an effective insult.
[4:57:19] <goatsaregoat> Probably cuz Eder slew her
[4:57:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> AND NO WE DON'T GIVE A FUCK IT'S NOT YO BIRTHDAY
[4:57:28] <%AbnormalVoid> Eder...from Streets
[4:57:29] <ArcticAsylum> Look at hia dumb little hat
[4:57:32] <$SGrim> I'mma play devil's advocate. Rinco's probably in a shit-load of pain. That can cause a shortening of temper and a loosing of tongue.
[4:57:37] <quantras6> EDER THE THOT SLAYER
[4:57:54] <Lee_The_Limey> Eder is ice cold
[4:58:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> Eder like the dick tbh
[4:58:07] <ArcticAsylum> @sgrim Fair, doesn't help the situation when everyone is a cunt about it lol
[4:58:08] <goatsaregoat> Was she cheating or is Rinco just a bad loser?
[4:58:08] <count_bob> Eder is still thinking about his old girlfriend.
[4:58:09] <captainthunderwolf> Y'know, we don't know for sure that Eder's not gay.
[4:58:10] <TheImmortal70> I'm also going to go out on a limb and say option 2 would somehow be better, even though you didn't make the woman apologize for kicking his ass
[4:58:15] <deviljhojho94> oh you get all stances, that is fantastic
[4:58:17] <captainthunderwolf> I'd kind of like it if Eder was gay.
[4:58:19] <deliciouspies> Eder doesn't mince his words like a bitch, he just says what he feels
[4:58:27] <Dellago> She beat his ass because he was bein a racist douche in the first place, not too torn up about it
[4:58:30] <deviljhojho94> Eder likes tradition but maybe fucking other dudes is traditional here
[4:58:31] <deviljhojho94> maybe
[4:58:32] <+KoyaMusa> he literally talked about fucking a girl before what do you mean
[4:58:33] <TheImmortal70> Rinco is an asshole, but Mokeha kicked his ass instead of just defending herself easily
[4:58:43] <thegrimreaper76> Is this game free to play like the first one?
[4:58:51] <goatsaregoat> no grim
[4:58:51] <captainthunderwolf> @KoyaMusa Yeah man, switching pronouns is some high-level lie tech.
[4:58:52] <kortex64> lolwut
[4:58:53] <TheImmortal70> Hell no
[4:58:56] <$SGrim> @ArcticAsylum oh I'm not saying he's helping. And he'd probably be a lot more contrite if Mokeha was in the room. DarkMode
[4:58:57] <TheImmortal70> What? The first wasn't free at all
[4:59:02] <lankaster88> Maybe he's curious Kappa
[4:59:02] <StubYourToe> nah man, its $50
[4:59:04] <startadevy> bug
[4:59:04] <kortex64> you're confusing it with path of exile
[4:59:18] <StubYourToe> Its a full on retail game
[4:59:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> "I was feeling a little bi-curious"
[4:59:37] <Lee_The_Limey> Go back and tell Mokeha what he said Kappa
[4:59:38] <thegrimreaper76> Yeah I am my bad.
[4:59:39] <TheImmortal70> Get him a hammer
[4:59:41] <ArcticAsylum> @sgrim I say burn it all down, town seems fullcof assholes GOWKratos
[4:59:41] <captainthunderwolf> Path of Exile's skill system is so batshit.
[4:59:44] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 5 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 20oz (600mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[4:59:45] <TheImmortal70> He needs blunt damage for certain areas
[4:59:57] <deviljhojho94> Still, its probably a bad idea for devs to focus on shipping companions with the PC. It often detracts from their personality if they are just there for romacnes
[4:59:58] <kortex64> i heard path of exile is great, i'm not into diablo likes though
[5:00:11] <deliciouspies> @AngriestPat it's also been 5 hours of that swiss cheese just chilling there
[5:00:14] <ArcticAsylum> LUL
[5:00:15] <+KoyaMusa> @captainthunderwolf man i can't tell if you've been joking with me throughout the stream or not, i give in
[5:00:17] <JT137> The Bot Seeks WATER
[5:00:20] <$SGrim> @ArcticAsylum we need them to finish helping us, steal all there stuff, and get anyone useful on the crew. Then we burn it down DarkMode
[5:00:21] <StubYourToe> path of exile its a great free to play
[5:00:23] <deviljhojho94> BASED HYDRO BOT
[5:00:26] <prime_name> God, I never want to play DnD with Pat.
[5:00:27] <deliciouspies> you haven't touched it, just put it back in the damn fridge
[5:00:29] <KTDelgado> th skill system in poe is ridiculous
[5:00:40] <count_bob> ALL THE GUNS.
[5:00:41] <$spacehouse> Maximum GUN
[5:00:47] <GarbageQueenEllie> But what about Narrator-chan?
[5:00:48] <ArcticAsylum> BIG GUN
[5:00:52] <StubYourToe> The skill system being this elaborate is actually appreciated
[5:00:59] <captainthunderwolf> @KoyaMusa Pretty much everything I say in chat is either a flippant retort, a joke, or advice slash lore on the game. No genuine offense intended.
[5:01:03] <StubYourToe> many games are dumbed down
[5:01:12] <deviljhojho94> Seduce the narrator for the ultimate meta romance
[5:01:12] <ArcticAsylum> Xoti is thw cutest thing ever
[5:01:20] <Ryo_no_Kage> @kortex64 it isn't a diablo like tho, sure they share the same isometric camera angle but that is where the similarities end.
[5:01:22] <captainthunderwolf> @KoyaMusa And that's also just how I talk, which I have to assume is frustrating for people.
[5:01:24] <StubYourToe> @ArcticAsylum yup
[5:01:29] <Lee_The_Limey> Hydration bot completely ignored by Pat Kappa
[5:01:36] <kortex64> Ryo_no_Kage i'm talking about path of exile, not this
[5:01:39] <deliciouspies> and his poor cheese
[5:01:45] <deviljhojho94> I like the pseudo mexicans on Pillars tbh
[5:01:49] <Ryo_no_Kage> @kortex64 derp ^^;;;
[5:01:50] <deviljhojho94> Monks are fairly original
[5:01:52] <KTDelgado> some get plague to draw shawty and eder in the resident evil meme
[5:01:55] <StubYourToe> redbull isn't very good hydration, brah
[5:02:02] <deliciouspies> @pat your SWISS CHEESE
[5:02:04] <Dozale> tanKING Eder
[5:02:05] <captainthunderwolf> @deviljhojho94 I'm actually completely with you, BTW. I hate when a character is written with a focus on romance options. It turns them into weird waifu bait instead of characters.
[5:02:06] <%ziriken> is he still eating the cheese? after 4 hours?
[5:02:08] <deliciouspies> aweh he stoppe dlooking
[5:02:14] <ArcticAsylum> Fast
[5:02:14] <shimapanhero> He is asserting dominance over the hyrdration bot by ignoring it and killing himself with redbull.
[5:02:18] <+KoyaMusa> @captainthunderwolf nah now that i get what you're on about i really don't mind, i know you've been in all the old pillar streams so you're definitely learned about this stuff
[5:02:18] <Dozale> by foot
[5:02:18] <StubYourToe> with your feet
[5:02:42] <StubYourToe> you'll do it one day
[5:02:47] <+SomeSortOfMagic> i have solution to all the problems take the kratos approach murder every god we all saw how that turnd out
[5:02:48] <aslfrasle> @AngriestPat Put the cheese away and drink your water.
[5:02:52] <deliciouspies> ^
[5:02:54] <deliciouspies> thank you\
[5:02:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> @captainthunderwolf I also dislike characters who are written with the focus on romance options, but a character who is a romantic and wants to be with a character can be interesting.
[5:02:59] <+Preacher5000> anyone know wh has the best deal on this game?
[5:03:05] <startadevy> laugh
[5:03:05] <$spacehouse> Drink your Elmo water
[5:03:13] <kortex64> damn I wish poe2 was god of war-esque and brought us on a quest to murder all of them
[5:03:17] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Preacher5000 It's not even out yet.
[5:03:19] <captainthunderwolf> @KoyaMusa Yeah dog, I'm just here to make people laugh or give advice, please don't ever take a response like my last one offensively. It's hard to get tone across in Twitch chat.
[5:03:20] <kortex64> that would have been a glorious munchkin nonsense
[5:03:22] <deliciouspies> @PeachSaliva Tell pat to put his god damn swiss cheese away if it's still next to him
[5:03:23] <ArcticAsylum> I don't mind romance characters as long as it's natural. Like Xoti saw Eder and got a higj school crush and that's adorable
[5:03:27] <deviljhojho94> @captainthunderwolf Damn straight my man. It is often a weird balance between making them interesting and pulling of a romance. Cant remember any game that did that well, honestly. Then again, maybe I just have not played one
[5:03:29] <quantras6> Xoti has a fucking TON of dialouge holy shit
[5:03:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> @ArcticAsylum Yes, agree 100%
[5:03:40] <captainthunderwolf> @Too_Much_Nukie Exactly. THAT works, because THAT makes them people!
[5:03:41] <SatansDick1> this is a pretty big island
[5:03:59] <TheImmortal70> This isn't even the inland
[5:04:07] <quantras6> @satansdick1 4U
[5:04:07] <StubYourToe> this is only a fraction of a fraction
[5:04:08] <TheImmortal70> We've got like ten of these zones from the full game most likely
[5:04:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> THE MIST
[5:04:12] <deviljhojho94> i wouldnt reall ymind going on a deicide adventure with the bois but some of the gods here are nice sometimes
[5:04:26] <Cybersoul666> God I can't wait to play this for myself
[5:04:35] <StubYourToe> cool
[5:04:35] <captainthunderwolf> @deviljhojho94 I mean, you had to get IN THERE in terms of pursuing a romantic dialogue to get with Tali or Garrus, so ME2 did alright. But the there's Miranda who just runs at your dick, so then there's that.
[5:04:43] <TheImmortal70> Nah man smt rules, even if a god or demon has a point to it's method, it's always backed by some horrible fucked up shit
[5:04:45] <Heyestus> he big
[5:04:56] <kortex64> why yeah deviljhojho94 just leave to the player the choice to befriend some of them. But also give him the option to murder everyone in olympus SwiftRage
[5:05:02] <captainthunderwolf> WHO HERE SAW THAT POST WITH THE TERMINATOR ENEMY FROM SMT II GOING AROUND?
[5:05:16] <Wauughlord> Mornin' Pat/chat
[5:05:20] <captainthunderwolf> THE FUCKING CRUSADER KNIGHT WITH A SHOTGUN AND AN ASSAULT RIFLE AND GUNDAM WINGS?
[5:05:23] <TheImmortal70> Jesus is pissed, and he has GUNS
[5:05:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> @captainthunderwolf The Miranda romance is hilarious
[5:05:28] <StubYourToe> @Wauughlord Hey
[5:05:28] <startadevy> OH
[5:05:38] <ArcticAsylum> DID SOMEONE SAY BOY GOWKratos
[5:05:46] <ArcticAsylum> No dad Boar, oh
[5:05:46] <TheImmortal70> I bought the first smt on my phone a while back, it's incredibly disappointing the second one isn't translated
[5:05:49] <deviljhojho94> @captainthunderwolf Garrus and Tali were good, yeah. Bioware kinda lost their touch after ME2 I think. Inquisition was also pretty bland when it came to romance
[5:05:57] <DraxTD> Boy!!
[5:06:03] <count_bob> Eh.
[5:06:09] <Dellago> Love that loading screen art
[5:06:15] <deviljhojho94> @kortex64 My fellow godkiller, one day we will fuck up Ondra GOWKratos
[5:06:16] <count_bob> Inquisition had a decent romances.
[5:06:22] <JT137> that guy is tall
[5:06:27] <kortex64> phrasing !
[5:06:32] <ArcticAsylum> HUGE
[5:06:35] <deviljhojho94> big boi
[5:06:37] <quantras6> @garbagequeenellie I liked the Jack romance tbh. too bad mass effect 2 squadmates get fuck all content in 3
[5:06:46] <kortex64> I wouldn't mind going for her moon tho Kappa
[5:06:47] <captainthunderwolf> THIS SOUNDS LIKE A PARTY MEMBER VA
[5:06:52] <StubYourToe> big boys big poise
[5:06:57] <Lee_The_Limey> Well you stink of shit old man
[5:06:59] <ArcticAsylum> THAT'S A GOOD LINE
[5:07:02] <$i_am_therydon> that sounds like the darkest dungeon guy
[5:07:05] <prime_name> Hey Travis
[5:07:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> @quantras6 Oh the tragic fall of a good franchise.
[5:07:10] <deviljhojho94> i bet this boi has infinite poise
[5:07:31] <captainthunderwolf> @deviljhojho94 I agree, most of Bioware's stuff went downhill after the apex of ME2.
[5:07:34] <antthefool> “Fuck you gramps!”
[5:07:43] <JT137> these fuckers and there bullshit
[5:07:44] <Dozale> less of nothing

[5:08:09] <captainthunderwolf> @quantras6 Oh man, I forgot how cute Jack is. Nothing like a really angry hot chick with a bunch of tattoos and god-like powers.
[5:08:11] <+tigerfang86> thanks giant nature man

[5:08:41] <Wauughlord> @ArcticAsylum It's always a problem with stat-dependent games
[5:08:41] <TheImmortal70> Pat immediately steps on some relic, triggers the entire island of boards
[5:08:44] <TheImmortal70> *boars
[5:08:47] <captainthunderwolf> THAT NECKLACE WAS DEFINITELY IN PILLARS 1
[5:08:50] <+radskag> oof alright its 2am for me gnight yall, have fun w pillars 2 pat !
[5:08:51] <captainthunderwolf> (The art at least)
[5:08:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> Shawty's VA is Laura Bailey.
[5:09:05] <antthefool> Hey hey hey shawty
[5:09:15] <ArcticAsylum> @wauughlord True, always funny though. "I'LL KILL YOU. GO RIGHT ON AHEAD."
[5:09:25] <TheImmortal70> Somehow it's worse than her robes, holy shit are they good
[5:09:27] <$SGrim> @radskag have fun doing what you do in what I can only assume to be central Europe
[5:09:39] <+theericthebarbaric> How does this game look so far?
[5:09:42] <+Vlesh> I'm kind of watching a bit in the background here, and I just want to say that I adore Pat's little character
[5:09:49] <Dellago> Companions tend to start with stuff thats way better than what you find, atleast for a good few hours
[5:09:57] <captainthunderwolf> @theericthebarbaric Very good.
[5:10:00] <StubYourToe> @theericthebarbaric it looks great. much better designed than 1
[5:10:02] <antthefool> Is Pat a Dwarf?
[5:10:04] <Dellago> I dont think I changed Durance's robes until like 20 hours in
[5:10:07] <strangelee> Fight the lizards
[5:10:08] <asurite_warrior> i'm worried about the length of this game, how it does things and what the story is makes me feel itll be a shorter game
[5:10:10] <ArcticAsylum> @antthefool Yes
[5:10:11] <+Vlesh> Pat's a Dwarf in real life
[5:10:15] <Lee_The_Limey> Ropy strands
[5:10:15] <Insanity97> Is this coming out on switch?
[5:10:20] <StubYourToe> @antthefool Yes, and also in the game
[5:10:22] <lankaster88> Very solid start so far
[5:10:32] <ArcticAsylum> LIZZY BOIS
[5:10:36] <+theericthebarbaric> I want an RPG to play tonight :( I may pre-order this for next weekend though
[5:10:37] <Dozale> 50 xaurip spears in inventory soon(tm)
[5:10:40] <StubYourToe> scallies
[5:10:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> Egad! It's the scalies!
[5:10:51] <deviljhojho94> xaurip were born to be killed
[5:10:56] <+Vlesh> Choose your own Adventure books will never go out of style
[5:10:58] <lankaster88> The lizzard wizzard
[5:11:03] <Dellago> Oooh a Stilletto
[5:11:04] <StubYourToe> you found Paiges' scallie suit
[5:11:04] <DraxTD> LeaVe no shinny Unfound @angriestpat GOWKratos
[5:11:06] <kortex64> xaurips did nothing wrong BibleThump
[5:11:14] <Ser_Randal> GELLARDE
[5:11:15] <ArcticAsylum> LOOK AT THAT DUMB,HAT
[5:11:15] <Lee_The_Limey> Sick cape
[5:11:16] <captainthunderwolf> @asurite_warrior Difficult to say, but I'd take a really good 40 hour game over a middling 80 hour game.
[5:11:17] <TheImmortal70> Aha, you look even more like a fucked up musketeer
[5:11:22] <Dozale> Gellarde! well done. A formidable RPG in the old style. They don't build them like this anymore, you know. Not by the mainstream. Too niche for the publishers.
[5:11:24] <$SGrim> GOWKratos G E L L A R D E, BOI GOWAtreus
[5:11:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> You can wear CAPES in this game? So cool.
[5:11:32] <+theericthebarbaric> have you guys played any other great RPG's lately?
[5:11:32] <jagchan> wew lads
[5:11:33] <deviljhojho94> Engwithan shitheads leave REEEEE

[5:11:50] <+JayEarly> I’m really digging this music
[5:11:53] <deviljhojho94> speak of jesus to me guuuuurrrl
[5:11:55] <captainthunderwolf> @theericthebarbaric Playing KoTOR 2 right now, very good game. Actually a thousand times better than the first.
[5:11:56] <kortex64> theericthebarbaric I've played serpent in the staglands
[5:11:59] <kortex64> it's fantastic
[5:12:00] <%ziriken> speakin of religion, lets hunt god
[5:12:01] <Lee_The_Limey> Not good at Eder tho
[5:12:03] <$SGrim> @theericthebarbaric I'm pretty much always finding something to do in New Vegas.
[5:12:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> Maybe you should consolidate some of your skills later on.
[5:12:23] <captainthunderwolf> @theericthebarbaric Also playing Divinity: Original Sin 2, which is good, and Nier: Automata, which fucking counts, and is good.
[5:12:24] <+theericthebarbaric> Cool thanks for some recommendations! :)
[5:12:25] <Dellago> Oh baby I see that Iconic Projection, best Priest spell 2018
[5:12:26] <kortex64> kotor II is indeed an awesome game
[5:12:30] <TheImmortal70> What about monk?
[5:12:32] <Faultlined> Iconic Projection is the best
[5:12:33] <strangelee> Pillar of faith is rad as shit
[5:12:34] <startadevy> fitz
[5:12:36] <quantras6> so everyone is in agreement that Abydon is the only good god and is rad as fuck right?
[5:12:38] <ArcticAsylum> @captainthunderwolf Playing it as well on Xbox One right. I think KOTOR 1 is a better "Star Wars" stort while 2 is just better overrall
[5:12:42] <%Arxel1> Pillar of faith is some fun stuff
[5:12:46] <Ser_Randal> FUCK THE GODS
[5:12:54] <TheImmortal70> I mean pillars is prone, and Eder gets sneak attack off of prone
[5:13:03] <captainthunderwolf> @quantras6 Hylea and Eothas are cool, aside from them and Abydon the rest are assholes.
[5:13:04] <%commanderclaw> Iconic projection is great
[5:13:05] <Dozale> her lantern is a shield
[5:13:07] <ArcticAsylum> *story
[5:13:26] <startadevy> souls for real
[5:13:27] <captainthunderwolf> Ondra is a bitch.
[5:13:38] <GarbageQueenEllie> Mortification of the Soul sounds like Xoti whenever she tries to talk to Eder.
[5:13:44] <Dellago> ouch
[5:13:48] <ArcticAsylum> @garbagequeenellie Damn
[5:13:50] <StubYourToe> self-flagellation. this shawty is into weird sex stuff
[5:13:58] <TheImmortal70> If she doesn't get hit, that's actually really good. She just continously get better hits
[5:14:03] <quantras6> @captainthunderwolf oh yeah, that guy who destroyed your keep, killed you and all your pets seems like a real nice guy
[5:14:10] <Dellago> Xoti got ignored by her crush, gains +5 WOUND
[5:14:14] <$SGrim> @StubYourToe get you a freak Kreygasm
[5:14:15] <strangelee> Yeah Pat, kill yourself faster, good choice
[5:14:23] <+sogeki_dan> Hey Pat, how can you make combat in this game not be unfun? I wanna get into this game but combat isn't clicking
[5:14:27] <StubYourToe> sbfpOmg
[5:14:29] <TheImmortal70> Nah inflict wounds is actually really good
[5:14:31] <ArcticAsylum> Xoti needs a Princess Leia episode 6 outfit
[5:14:36] <quantras6> @dellago she also has a crush on the watcher though
[5:14:36] <captainthunderwolf> @quantras6 I mean, we fucking killed him with a nuke when he was trying to save the souls of a million babies from being eaten by another god
[5:14:39] <Lee_The_Limey> So Xoti is basically Farnese now Kappa
[5:14:39] <+theericthebarbaric> any of you guys play games like Baldurs Gate back in the day?
[5:14:46] <TheImmortal70> You take less damage than usually needed for the wounds, and then get faster dps
[5:15:07] <kortex64> Lady Farunesu
[5:15:15] <antthefool> Yaaas Farny
[5:15:16] <StubYourToe> @theericthebarbaric yup, this reminds me so much of bg2 that im getting it
[5:15:17] <captainthunderwolf> @quantras6 And in doing so literally murdered the positive aspect of his identity. I'm personally willing to hear him out on that.
[5:15:27] <captainthunderwolf> Fanding the laht.

[5:35:22] <captainthunderwolf> I don't mind that. Health didn't have much of a use in Pillars 1.
[5:35:33] <deviljhojho94> absolute unit
[5:35:36] <captainthunderwolf> Like it kept your tanks, way in the late game, from regenning health forever.
[5:35:40] <captainthunderwolf> But that was way niche.

[5:36:55] <captainthunderwolf> Hardtack is a biscuit made with saltwater, right?
[5:36:56] <lankaster88> Concrete crackers
[5:36:59] <captainthunderwolf> And it like never goes bad.
[5:37:00] <%jiin6> Hard tacks a biscuit
[5:37:04] <strangelee> Ran right past them again
[5:37:04] <%commanderclaw> Hardtack is water, flour, and salt.
[5:37:06] <%cerass> Damn I clipped it
[5:37:06] <captainthunderwolf> But sometimes bugs get into it.
[5:37:13] <captainthunderwolf> Yeah, thought so.
[5:37:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> yum yum
[5:37:19] <StubYourToe> bugs are in all foods
[5:37:20] <mas1992> so I'm waiting for the totally inferior version of this on the switch just so I can play it on the go
[5:37:21] <captainthunderwolf> Made to be rations that last a long time.
[5:37:21] <KTDelgado> INS
[5:37:32] <KTDelgado> I SMELL ANIMANCY
[5:37:54] <captainthunderwolf> @StubYourToe True, but specifically, many times on ships old hardtack would be infested with insects and they'd have to eat it insects and all.
[5:38:03] <StubYourToe> for every x amount grams of food, the FDA allows about 2 rat hairs and multiple bug parts
[5:38:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> Grubs are good nutrition. I have a helping of them every morning.
[5:38:19] <+Sheepwalk> extra protein
[5:38:22] <+Kabron3> this game has an aversion to color
[5:38:23] <kibenator> Creepy statue and "Young" panthers
[5:38:25] <StubYourToe> @captainthunderwolf sounds nasty, but nutritious
[5:38:30] <+Flambage> Eder needs Mccree lines modded in for when he has a gun for a more authentic gun gang experience
[5:38:39] <$psydaku> Hi pat
[5:38:53] <captainthunderwolf> @StubYourToe Yeah man, we Westerners are pussies, but honestly things like that pose no health risk to consume. They're just 'gross'.
[5:38:55] <deliciouspies> "it's ye olde midday"
[5:39:07] <deliciouspies> "SCRIBE"

[5:39:22] <TheImmortal70> Wow
[5:39:24] <goatsaregoat> Is Xotli a monk, priest, or wizard?
[5:39:24] <deviljhojho94> It was delicious
[5:39:26] <captainthunderwolf> @Kabron3 Pillars is kind of a bleak and uncomfortably realistic setting, so it's done intentionally to create tone.
[5:39:26] <strangelee> Is Pat on PotD?
[5:39:30] <StubYourToe> @captainthunderwolf Thats pretty much what the FDA says as to why they allow any at all. We westerners are just weak
[5:39:48] <+KoyaMusa> no he is a coward
[5:39:52] <%VoxNoctemz> Is this game co-op?
[5:39:58] <TheImmortal70> Monk first
[5:40:03] <%lucianon96plays> Pat's shirt is sick.
[5:40:05] <StubYourToe> this game as co op would be interesting
[5:40:11] <captainthunderwolf> @StubYourToe Y'know, bug meat is what a lot of people think will be the main protein in the future. It's extremely efficient to produce.
[5:40:13] <deviljhojho94> that is his streaming shirt
[5:40:20] <deviljhojho94> it provides him with sexual powers
[5:40:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> Xoti is secretly a Green Lantern

[5:40:39] <%lucianon96plays> It's his mojo shirt.
[5:40:41] <captainthunderwolf> He sleeps in an oxygen tent, which he believes give him SEXUAL POWERS.
[5:40:51] <KTDelgado> its the bioenergy that gives him his powers
[5:40:55] <StubYourToe> @captainthunderwolf True. I want to try deep fried crickets one day to test myself. Also, algae might be a good source
[5:41:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> Aren't all powers sexual by nature?
[5:41:16] <deviljhojho94> oh no, animancers

[5:46:44] <captainthunderwolf> @strangelee Pat has kind of an absolute disdain of traitors and just never liked Aloth's character, so he hated him permanently from the moment he found out Aloth was in the Leaden Key. It's really just a meme for everyone else.

[5:50:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> Give Aloth a bottle of mead spiked with HIV
[5:50:37] <kibenator> Rpg characters are either the sexiest people alive or memes
[5:50:39] <goatsaregoat> Why doesn't Pat like Aloth
[5:50:40] <+ChrisAlgoo> so the main quest is about kissing aloth right
[5:50:44] <StubYourToe> do squats like aloth
[5:50:53] <+KoyaMusa> @Dozale cause pat can't let go of a grudge
[5:50:53] <%Arxel1> goatsaregoat Because Aloth a shit
[5:50:54] <deviljhojho94> pat does not like aloth because he got the worst ending abailable for him last game, and wasted around an hour of everyone's time
[5:50:55] <captainthunderwolf> @goatsaregoat Pat hates traitors, even past traitors who apologize.
[5:50:56] <deviljhojho94> it was amazing
[5:51:07] <Dellago> Date Eder and Aloth, a Mercer for each arm
[5:51:35] <%commanderclaw> The ninth circle of hell is reserved for traitors
[5:51:38] <Dozale> cause aloth betrayed da watcher? @KoyaMusa
[5:51:44] <kibenator> Dating double Mercer is kinda creepy
[5:51:50] <+ChrisAlgoo> no pat kiss him
[5:51:51] <lautalocos> why are you so meeeeean
[5:51:58] <deviljhojho94> WITNESSED

[5:52:27] <Faultlined> Hey but Iselmyr is great though right
[5:52:29] <nedtheelf> And yet Pat decided to let Aloth live in the first game
[5:52:30] <deliciouspies> milk toast elf man
[5:52:35] <%jiin6> Generic jerk wizard
[5:52:38] <KTDelgado> hes a bitch boy......(YOU SHOULDVE FUCKING KILLED HIM IN 1)
[5:52:44] <masterfungi_z> imagine him playing simulator
[5:52:44] <TyrantBelial> HE COULDA BEEN COOLER AS A SPELLBLADE
[5:52:44] <mr_slaide> Without mentionning that he spied on you the entire time with the organization that started all the shit in the region.
[5:52:46] <drakthebest> But Aloth never betrayed the Watcher. He never did anything against you. He only didn’t tell you about the fact that he USED to work for the organization that he didn’t even know was super evil
[5:52:48] <TyrantBelial> BUT YOU MADE HIM STYAY LAME
[5:52:53] <TyrantBelial> LAME PAT WIZARD
[5:52:55] <Dozale> Aloth of hate man, not good
[5:52:59] <deliciouspies> OBLIGE US XOTI
[5:53:01] <kibenator> 90% of elves are like that tho
[5:53:04] <Dellago> Yeah I wish there was a way to make the Scottish girl the default personality between them
[5:53:09] <+ChrisAlgoo> oh no everyone in this game is hot we got this southern-ass monk
[5:53:10] <deviljhojho94> Aloth of people think he is ok
[5:53:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> You should max out his S-Link just so you can kill him off after
[5:53:15] <Lee_The_Limey> @Dozale booooooooo
[5:53:27] <+SmirkinRascal> Lol that sounded like "I thought you were black"
[5:53:36] <Bouldus> lol the Aloth sympathiser's Kappa
[5:53:57] <deviljhojho94> Aloth of elves are like that
[5:53:58] <blackorchidKI2> I have no idea who Aloth is but the most I've heard is amusing
[5:54:02] <deliciouspies> "Don't shoot, that man ISN'T black "
[5:54:11] <leinadtonu> I`m surprised nothing has broken yet.
[5:54:13] <blackorchidKI2> But I don't get the hate.
[5:54:16] <kibenator> @deviljhojho94 wow
[5:54:18] <Lee_The_Limey> @deviljhojho94 stop
[5:54:20] <Dozale> well you can't finish this game's finale without aloth in the party, its known
[5:54:24] <+KoyaMusa> yeah that's obsidian for you isn't it :^)
[5:54:37] <kortex64> Aloth of people in this chat wuld like you to stop deviljhojho94
[5:54:39] <$SGrim> @deliciouspies one of the purest sentences a dub has ever brought to the west LuL
[5:54:50] <Thenuclearwalrus> Obsidian seems to have a track record of releasing fucked up versions of games
[5:54:51] <deviljhojho94> @kibenator @Lee_The_Limey wow, these jokes are falling flat for aloth of people huh @kortex64
[5:54:53] <%commanderclaw> Durance's quest was broken in Vanilla
[5:54:54] <%ziriken> does this qualify as beta?
[5:55:00] <startadevy> a kitt
[5:55:03] <startadevy> hey
[5:55:06] <deliciouspies> @SGrim I still can't believe it was really a line
[5:55:09] <kibenator> *CRAZY TALK*
[5:55:19] <kortex64> deviljhojho94 I think Aloth of it has to do with how cheesy your puns are
[5:55:23] <RedPlasticCup> In other words, the delay was a good thing?
[5:55:42] <Maverick2736> He's actually aa really interesting and complex character with some pretty big developments in the story of the first game, but it takes Aloth of work to get to the good parts of his personal story
[5:55:45] <deviljhojho94> @kortex64 Sorry man, I just like cheesy jokes Aloth
[5:55:52] <kortex64> But then again, you seem to be on your way to Edérnally pull them out
[5:55:56] <$SGrim> @deliciouspies the long and short of explaining that line is "thanks Japan!" SeemsGood
[5:55:57] <lankaster88> Aloth new meme? Kappa
[5:56:00] <deviljhojho94> ooooh thats nice
[5:56:12] <kibenator> @kortex64 Dont be to harsh on the man, he puts Aloth of effort on his puns
[5:56:20] <Dozale> Sure sounds like Aloth of polish went in this game, right?
[5:56:20] <Thenuclearwalrus> What is the time period of this game? Some of the architecture looks modern, but then you are flinging spells and fighting with swords, its weird
[5:56:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> You guys should stop with the puns and focus on getting Patron's ship Aloth
[5:56:33] <mr_slaide> SKELETAL WARRIOR!
[5:56:40] <Thenuclearwalrus> DANANANNA
[5:56:45] <deliciouspies> NA NA

[5:57:11] <mr_slaide> Aloth is an asshole.
[5:57:18] <Peashooter117> Da da da da da!
[5:57:34] <mr_gentleman96> Just got here. What class/classes is pat running???
[5:57:44] <startstoprepeat> aloth's been off killing all his former buddies between games. maybe he's better now.
[5:57:46] <TyrantBelial> Wizard
[5:57:49] <mr_gentleman96> noice
[5:57:49] <TyrantBelial> tjhe most boring classs possible
[5:58:04] <KTDelgado> "Immune"
[5:58:04] <TyrantBelial> and he made aloth pure boring wiard too
[5:58:05] <%ziriken> bumps on pickles are very useful Kappa
[5:58:11] <Dozale> deadfire looks aloth better than pillars 1 IMO
[5:58:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> Holy shit Xoti's Hillbillying it up
[5:58:18] <kibenator> @startstoprepeat there is Aloth wrong with him?
[5:58:22] <%akuda_bar> i'm only just now listening to these lines, what the hell was that about a bump on a pickle
[5:58:34] <deliciouspies> I bet Xoti would "go down"

[5:59:13] <Too_Much_Nukie> These puns aren't eder funny guys.
[5:59:21] <Maverick2736> chat, this is seriously Aloth of fucking puns. We need to stop
[5:59:43] <%Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 6 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 24oz (720mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[5:59:44] <startstoprepeat> you're all just palleginerising each others jokes at this point.
[5:59:44] <+KoyaMusa> pat just can't handle Aloth of humor
[5:59:49] <Kaneis> I have such a hard time finishing the first game
[5:59:51] <Dozale> Aloth will show thee!
[5:59:53] <buffmurffy> its not even clever, everyone is just doing the same pun
[5:59:55] <&Legoremix> I feel the need to pillar-y this chat for its awful puns
[6:00:00] <+RudyManchego> that's right @maverick2736 , there can be only pun!
[6:00:01] <+KoyaMusa> @startstoprepeat ohhh that's good
[6:00:04] <KTDelgado> GELLARDE
[6:00:07] <deliciouspies> @AngriestPat and also just over 6 hours of that swiss cheese being out
[6:00:10] <mr_slaide> She's a hot pally.
[6:00:12] <%akuda_bar> that's aloth of water
[6:00:19] <%ziriken> !raffle aloth
[6:00:28] <Dozale> I like Pallegina aloth
[6:00:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> It seems like you're the Palagenius, Pat
[6:00:30] <Faultlined> Is Hiravirus in this game or no
[6:00:32] <$SGrim> @Legoremix but that will make this stream lag on from an eternity
[6:00:34] <Wistelligence> don't worry, pat's Xoti nough that most of the puns'll go right over his head
[6:00:59] <+KoyaMusa> pat casts bullet
[6:00:59] <kibenator> @wistelligence you tried
[6:01:22] <deliciouspies> took me a second on that one
[6:01:28] <+wreckinize> punch girl
[6:01:45] <mr_slaide> Woolie's erection is massive atm. She's a punch girl with short hair.
[6:01:51] <Dozale> she DID aloth of damage!
[6:01:52] <+gingaginge> Wistelligence I enjoyed it
[6:01:54] <Wistelligence> @kibenator that was perfect and you know it
[6:02:00] <mr_slaide> Elmo is displeased.
[6:02:01] <lankaster88> CoolCat
[6:02:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> So from what I can gather, Aloth is going to get Aloffed at the first chance?
[6:02:22] <Faultlined> I do hope Hiravirus is in this game his banter is amazing
[6:02:45] <captainthunderwolf> Y'know, I don't think being racist against Orlans counts.
[6:02:55] <Thenuclearwalrus> So do party members just use skills as they feel appropriate and you can choose to manually use them?
[6:03:03] <count_bob> It does.
[6:03:13] <StubYourToe> its the redbull
[6:03:14] <+RudyManchego> !uptime
[6:03:14] <captainthunderwolf> I found the Orlan in chat.
[6:03:14] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 6h 3m 23s.
[6:03:22] <lankaster88> 24 hour stream confirmed
[6:03:26] <deliciouspies> it's the room temp cheese giving him power
[6:03:26] <count_bob> Yes.
[6:03:28] <count_bob> Yes you did!~
[6:03:30] <JusTTheGuyYouNeed> its the Aloth puns
[6:03:32] <count_bob> Good job!
[6:03:35] <count_bob> You get a cookie.
[6:03:49] <kibenator> Woolie grime?
[6:03:53] <Dozale> red bulls crashed into each other last week
[6:04:00] <sangi53> please make the mic cover your face Kappa
[6:04:10] <captainthunderwolf> I'd never be able to play as an Orlan for the same reason I can't play as a dwarf.
[6:04:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> As far as streams go, it doesn't get Eder than this.
[6:04:19] <deliciouspies> Smash two redbulls over your head like Steve Austin woulda done
[6:04:20] <captainthunderwolf> I just can't play a character that looks nothing like me.
[6:04:23] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat yeah Pat, sit up like a cool big man. You get into that role-playing spirit. LUL
[6:04:33] <count_bob> Fair enough thunderwolf.

[6:05:05] <masterfungi_z> M1 abrams tank confirmed to be a roman candle on treads
[6:05:14] <bear_breaker20> how does pillars do its dlc? is it like a new thing?
[6:05:15] <captainthunderwolf> @count_bob Yeah, and I recognize it as kind of a dumb flaw, because RPGs are about RPing. But I'm there to be me, talk to people about stabbing dudes, et cetera. You know how it is.
[6:05:18] <KTDelgado> FUCK
[6:05:22] <BlindGato> So this the starting island in Divinity 2?
[6:05:28] <Dozale> snuff a candle!

[6:05:44] <goatsaregoat> you no take candel
[6:05:48] <TrashCorner> did pat play divinity 2?
[6:05:57] <captainthunderwolf> ^^ No take candle.
[6:06:02] <captainthunderwolf> Wait, wait a fucking second.
[6:06:05] <captainthunderwolf> Purple and green.
[6:06:14] <captainthunderwolf> This entire series is Woolie's thing.
[6:06:19] <KTDelgado> WOOLIE!
[6:06:21] <goatsaregoat> but he's destroying herleft and right
[6:06:39] <+MesoWarlock> @AngriestPat go and hire a mercenary?
[6:06:41] <$SGrim> @goatsaregoat Tsun-tsun Eder.
[6:06:46] <kortex64> I think it works the other way around, she reallyl ikes him
[6:06:46] <BlindGato> oh right Pat played Divinity with Paige
[6:06:52] <kortex64> so it shows on his window, like for yours
[6:06:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> @goatsaregoat So that the Protag can destoru her later
[6:07:08] <$SGrim> OH MY GOD. EDER IS AN ANAGRAM OF DERE! DansGame
[6:07:21] <mr_slaide> So dank
[6:07:22] <ArcticAsylum> LUL LUL LUL
[6:07:25] <deliciouspies> @GarbageQueenEllie you gotta break them down before you build them back up
[6:07:35] <kibenator> Eder also anagram for Deer
[6:07:36] <%ziriken> Also Deer, the sexiest of creatures
[6:07:46] <captainthunderwolf> @SGrim Even more, his name is an anagram of "Dyrwood". A forest country he's from that is full of deer.
[6:07:46] <Maverick2736> Tsuneder
[6:07:51] <%ziriken> And reed, the most average of canon
[6:07:51] <kortex64> the totel animal of the dyrwood, it all makes sense
[6:07:55] <captainthunderwolf> @ziriken You get it.
[6:07:58] <Bouldus> gang shit
[6:08:01] <Bouldus> gang gang
[6:08:05] <GarbageQueenEllie> @deliciouspies Damn right. Like Woolie says, "Treat her good by treating her bad"
[6:08:12] <count_bob> THE GUN. IS GOOD.
[6:08:14] <deliciouspies> lmao he said that?
[6:08:20] <Thenuclearwalrus> Pat unleashes his secret technique, A GUN
[6:08:22] <hazardkujacker> ZARDOZ
[6:08:25] <KTDelgado> FUCKING ANIMANCY
[6:08:32] <count_bob> THE PENIS...IS EVIL.
[6:08:38] <+KoyaMusa> woolie wouldn't like eder cause woolie likes beating animals
[6:08:40] <captainthunderwolf> @deliciouspies I think it was in reference to new fighting game players, but aye.
[6:08:51] <goatsaregoat> animancers god damn it
[6:08:52] <startadevy> go goblin go
[6:08:53] <deliciouspies> ah yeah that'd do it
[6:09:02] <kibenator> Ectoplasm
[6:09:07] <%Arxel1> Fucking animancers
[6:09:10] <KommandantRaphael > jfc hes still going
[6:09:13] <deliciouspies> something somethin gI'll pressure you on wake up girl
[6:09:19] <Heyestus> Your workers can't die from exhaustion if they're already dead!
[6:09:21] <DarkPlague20> nothing can go wrong with ghost power *coughbeyondtwosoulscough*
[6:09:21] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat that's like the default power supply. Some people use Duracell, others use the Dearly Departed 4Head
[6:09:27] <%jiin6> The souls of young kids are the best batteries
[6:09:32] <%commanderclaw> I feel like an actual D&D Necromancer does less damage than the average Animancer
[6:09:52] <kamehamehAdrian> dkcoJorge dkcoJorge dkcoJorge dkcoJorge dkcoLuis dkcoJorge
[6:10:03] <deliciouspies> @jiin6 kids are full of energy, most of it they waste
[6:10:03] <Mrbaconator> Powpers
[6:10:06] <KTDelgado> animancy can destroy a soul... thats pretty damn strong
[6:10:08] <GarbageQueenEllie> For someone who's going to get terminated, he seems pretty Alooth.
[6:10:16] <roobanguy> fuk u pat for getting this game early :(
[6:10:21] <kamehamehAdrian> dkcoJorge dkcoJorge dkcoJorge dkcoLuis dkcoJorge
[6:10:29] <captainthunderwolf> @commanderclaw At least necromancers admit that they're evil, Animancers just do shit and expect to get away with it because it's science. Meanwhile these fuckers invented zombies AND vampires and SKELETONS.
[6:10:34] <ArcticAsylum> COOL
[6:10:39] <+MGKBurrito> YEYEYE
[6:10:39] <StubYourToe> thats bad
[6:10:40] <Bouldus> nice mask?
[6:10:42] <%Kurvera> arexShow
[6:10:43] <Mariakko> But it looks good on you
[6:10:46] <count_bob> Make Aloth wear it.
[6:10:51] <KTDelgado> GIVE IT TO ALOTH
[6:10:53] <DarkPlague20> why does pats character have a gremlin like stance?
[6:10:53] <ArcticAsylum> ITS COOL WTF PAT
[6:10:55] <+reiju_22> LUL
[6:10:59] <%commanderclaw> @captainthunderwolf I'll take Skeltor over Mengele any day
[6:10:59] <goatsaregoat> I don't see why not
[6:11:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> Now you have to wear the SHAME HAT
[6:11:04] <Maverick2736> makes you look like a pervy snake oil salesman
[6:11:23] <Foreluney> !uptime
[6:11:23] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 6h 11m 31s.
[6:11:26] <%Kurvera> is this the new gungang
[6:11:29] <captainthunderwolf> @commanderclaw Goddamn right. You need to find more excuses to use that phrase in your day to day.
[6:11:42] <goatsaregoat> The character variety seems crazy. I've watched 4 different streams and the main characters all look both cool and unique.
[6:11:45] <deviljhojho94> eder is my favorite anime girl
[6:11:46] <dreu81> Gun mage dwarf.... is this shadowrun?
[6:12:01] <ArcticAsylum> Deja vu???
[6:12:04] <deliciouspies> boos ash fight?
[6:12:07] <deliciouspies> sss
[6:12:22] <captainthunderwolf> Boos ash fight incoming boys, you heard it.
[6:12:24] <Faultlined> Ashley PogChamp
[6:12:25] <hazardkujacker> @dreu81 pretty much. It also helps that Shadowrun did have a fantasy setting
[6:12:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> Hello again, Narrator-chan
[6:12:30] <hazardkujacker> PIKE
[6:12:32] <kibenator> Ellie?
[6:12:37] <%commanderclaw> Yeah, more Ashley Johnson
[6:12:42] <%Arxel1> pike!
[6:12:42] <ArcticAsylum> Garbage???
[6:12:45] <captainthunderwolf> @deliciouspies (Been there pal, nothing like a type mangling your comment in public)
[6:12:50] <goatsaregoat> I don't think he'd be very ready for a boss fight eder
[6:12:53] <StubYourToe> this is really nice
[6:12:54] <captainthunderwolf> ^ TYPO. I DID IT!
[6:13:03] <deliciouspies> @captainthunderwolf I embrace all typos
[6:13:11] <Dozale> Khalid Knight
[6:13:12] <deliciouspies> even yours
[6:13:19] <goatsaregoat> Is this the chick from Critical Role?
[6:13:23] <TheImmortal70> Oh hello berath
[6:13:33] <%commanderclaw> @goatsaregoat It's Ashley
[6:13:33] <%th3madness> I'm not sure I'm down with the narrator
[6:13:39] <hazardkujacker> @goatsaregoat one of the chicks. The one that shows up sporadically
[6:13:40] <Faultlined> Yes this is one of the chicks from Critical Role
[6:13:40] <%th3madness> maybe I'm just old
[6:13:41] <+TonberryCrunch> The whole cast of Crit Role is in Pillars 2
[6:13:47] <kibenator> Its Ashley Johnson
[6:13:47] <TheImmortal70> So I see a huge problem with continuously throwing more and more souls at a god
[6:13:48] <mr_slaide> MEOW
[6:13:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> I like this lady. There's something about her mannerisms that's just so...familiar.
[6:13:52] <hazardkujacker> BTW #CancelBlindspot
[6:13:56] <TheImmortal70> This is what Thaos tried last game
[6:14:00] <ArcticAsylum> This is some Edgy shit
[6:14:00] <Dozale> Peelars of Eternity tyme?
[6:14:06] <captainthunderwolf> @TheImmortal70 Your name sums it up pretty well, actually
[6:14:08] <mr_slaide> Meow!
[6:14:15] <+Audega> Just got here, has he found Elmo yet?
[6:14:21] <deliciouspies> nah not yet

[6:15:03] <KommandantRaphael > PET THE GOOD BOY

[6:15:17] <lankaster88> GOWKratos Eothas
[6:15:17] <TheImmortal70> Wow he really is just trying to power up
[6:15:18] <Daxalog> Kneading the tums
[6:15:22] <crimsonharvest> Hello everyone and Pat
[6:15:22] <Reanimator83> Elmo wants that cheese
[6:15:22] <captainthunderwolf> Oh, so Eothas wants to EAT THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
[6:15:36] <ArcticAsylum> BibleThump
[6:15:37] <captainthunderwolf> IS THAOS JUST ONE OF THE KAIJU BEETLES FROM GODZILLA 2014?
[6:15:39] <StubYourToe> @crimsonharvest Sup
[6:15:42] <%th3madness> Oh, Eothas possessed the statue
[6:15:45] <%th3madness> that's neat
[6:15:47] <%Pendragwn> Is this some sort of Pillar of Eternity
[6:15:48] <%Pendragwn> 2
[6:15:52] <hazardkujacker> BTW Eothas is voiced by goth dad himself; Tallisen Jaffe
[6:15:52] <captainthunderwolf> Eothas, not Thaos, dammit.
[6:15:58] <deliciouspies> PENETRATE
[6:16:01] <TheImmortal70> Eothas is SO BIG
[6:16:07] <TheImmortal70> His NUMBERS ARE TOO BIG
[6:16:10] <captainthunderwolf> His number is HUGE
[6:16:12] <mr_slaide> Eothas is an asshole.
[6:16:14] <+dodge_and_dust> @hazardkujacker that is a good choice
[6:16:21] <captainthunderwolf> We gotta push him for GodSlam!
[6:16:23] <DarkPlague20> oh thats what this golden god thing reminds me of, defenders quest
[6:16:30] <kibenator> Eothas is also bald
[6:16:33] <TheImmortal70> So how do you guys bet we topple him?
[6:16:34] <startadevy> you smoked a joint and went on a beer run
[6:16:43] <+TonberryCrunch> make the godhammer 2
[6:16:49] <TheImmortal70> I say we use all the souls we gather throughout of the game to nuke him again, on a giant level
[6:16:51] <captainthunderwolf> OH MAN HE LIKES YOU
[6:16:51] <GarbageQueenEllie> KILL HIM
[6:16:52] <%commanderclaw> Taleisin Jaffe!
[6:16:56] <captainthunderwolf> HE'S JUST JESUS
[6:16:59] <captainthunderwolf> THIS IS THE BEST
[6:17:12] <count_bob> WELP.
[6:17:13] <+dodge_and_dust> oh no he wants to save us. this must be worse then we thought
[6:17:16] <+Jimbocho7> PERCY!
[6:17:16] <Maverick2736> GIGANTO-JESUS
[6:17:16] <count_bob> That's not concerning.
[6:17:17] <Dozale> SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL IS COMING!
[6:17:23] <%Arxel1> No Mercy Percy\
[6:17:24] <hazardkujacker> ROLL THOSE CRITS PERCY
[6:17:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> GIVE ME BACK MY SOUL YOU BITCH
[6:17:30] <Heyestus> Gimme mah SOWL
[6:17:33] <Iam_Dead> @AngriestPat I just got here, how are these early hours?
[6:17:48] <startadevy> no debit card?
[6:17:53] <deliciouspies> no problem
[6:17:53] <Lee_The_Limey> EOTENS Kappa
[6:17:56] <startadevy> e-bit only
[6:18:02] <%Arxel1> Heyestus GIVE ME THE ADRA
[6:18:03] <%jiin6> Iwant my soul family back
[6:18:05] <captainthunderwolf> Hey, last time we stopped Eothas from saving us, didn't we FORSAKE BABIES TO ENDLESS DOOM????
[6:18:20] <startadevy> lawyered
[6:18:25] <deliciouspies> but the babies didn't know that so was anyone wronged in the end
[6:18:49] <GarbageQueenEllie> @captainthunderwolf B-but mah soul... I need that to eat!
[6:18:49] <Lee_The_Limey> Talking dirty Kappa
[6:18:53] <TheImmortal70> @captainthunderwolf Yeah, but it was sick as shit. He got nuked on a bridge
[6:18:53] <captainthunderwolf> Like, I'm being serious. I don't KNOW that Eothas is the bad guy now, and that's AMAZING given the circumstances.
[6:18:55] <jacknerik> I assume this pillar is one of those etermity pillars
[6:18:57] <captainthunderwolf> This is really cool!
[6:18:57] <kibenator> EOTHAS DESTROY MY BOI AND MY WIFE IS YOURS
[6:18:59] <TheImmortal70> WORTH
[6:19:17] <lankaster88> You were gone for 84 years
[6:19:22] <captainthunderwolf> @TheImmortal70 With a bomb called the fUCKING GODHAMMER
[6:19:22] <Lee_The_Limey> YOU MUST REKINDLE THE FIRST FLAME
[6:19:48] <%jiin6> 5 sounds like the jrpg thing to do
[6:19:51] <RubberFistFight> aw geez he's still live!
[6:19:51] <goatsaregoat> Wow qute aloth of love triangles in here
[6:19:58] <captainthunderwolf> @jacknerik The pillars are formations of Adra, a living jade-like stone that appears to be a circuit for the souls of the world that allows them to be reborn.
[6:20:31] <captainthunderwolf> @jacknerik As in, the 'pillars' is a reference to Adra, not specific pillars. BUT, it's a double meaning, because the GODS are ALSO 'Pillars of Eternity'.
[6:20:31] <Dozale> Aloth of hums, man
[6:20:33] <captainthunderwolf> See?
[6:20:34] <KTDelgado> QLOTH IS GETTING HI RELIGION BONER WHILE EDER IS GETTING EVEN MORE RLACCID
[6:20:41] <Maverick2736> So adra is just mako energy from FF7
[6:20:51] <deliciouspies> yee
[6:20:53] <captainthunderwolf> Adra is a rock that CONTAINS the Lifestream.
[6:20:54] <RubberFistFight> PAAAAT you're gonna have too much poop in your butt from all that cheese! rubber16Whargarbl
[6:20:56] <captainthunderwolf> But that's pretty close.
[6:20:59] <turbulentstriker> Just got home from work, How is Pillars 2 looking?
[6:21:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> Good even better than 1.
[6:21:12] <Seraphile> y no stealth
[6:21:14] <goatsaregoat> It looks better than sex
[6:21:16] <captainthunderwolf> Good. Pillars 2 looks really good.
[6:21:22] <kibenator> Adra is green god cum
[6:21:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> You get to cuck Eder!
[6:21:37] <DarkPlague20> well as much as i would like to stay, its time to go
[6:21:41] <turbulentstriker> I've made a rule that I wont buy PoE 2 until I finish my current playthrough of 1
[6:21:42] <captainthunderwolf> I would argue that in some ways Pillars 2 is probably better than sex, particularly if you're getting it often enough.
[6:21:51] <%jiin6> Stealth? Not in this gun gang
[6:21:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Too_Much_Nukie Is it really cucking if he don't even want da gurl?
[6:21:59] <captainthunderwolf> Pillars 2, I mean. Sex is yucky, girls are yucky.
[6:22:12] <deliciouspies> look at that party scooby doo run
[6:22:41] <%Arxel1> There's also like a hidden cell in the menagerie Pat
[6:22:47] <turbulentstriker> Is that game much more demanding than 1, graphically?
[6:22:56] <mr_slaide> AND NOW I BRING OUT MAH GUN
[6:22:56] <captainthunderwolf> @GarbageQueenEllie That's the quantum cuckery - it disappears as soon as it is noticed, but can't be disproven as something in existence.
[6:22:57] <+Superstarsage> Pew Pew
[6:23:26] <Solidus_113> can someone please make a Gun Gang rap song like Umby did with the Elmo Song?
[6:23:28] <captainthunderwolf> @turbulentstriker It's hard to say. The first Pillars was just badly optimized. This one could run much better, because it's not actually that much BETTER graphically, so much as the art design is better now.
[6:23:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> @GarbageQueenEllie It's not cucking, I was making a funny.
[6:23:44] <hazardkujacker> GAMBINO!?
[6:23:52] <%centrilion> It look like it has better lighting but other then that seems not much diff then 1 graphically.
[6:23:53] <captainthunderwolf> @turbulentstriker Realistically speaking, this shouldn't be nearly as hard to run as say XCOM 2.
[6:24:01] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Too_Much_Nukie Just getting philosophical. Let's mega-cuck him!
[6:24:10] <+dodge_and_dust> i don't see how we could possibly catch up to that statue. we still need to get our boat back out there and i find it unlikely that the boat is faster then a giant man
[6:24:14] <turbulentstriker> @captainthunderwolf right away, I'm the new lighting. If I can run Divinity 2, then hopefully I should be able to run this
[6:24:20] <turbulentstriker> *I love the new lighting
[6:24:25] <VritraReiRei> !uptime
[6:24:25] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 6h 24m 34s.
[6:24:33] <captainthunderwolf> @turbulentstriker Unless this game is terribly optimized, you should be able to easily.
[6:24:42] <deliciouspies> destiny is destiny @turbulentstriker
[6:24:43] <StubYourToe> oh great, puzzles
[6:24:44] <Mexrage> man, those shadows looks so good
[6:24:49] <%commanderclaw> PUZZLE TIME
[6:25:06] <lankaster88> Can you solve it?!?
[6:25:10] <turbulentstriker> Oof that fire looks good
[6:25:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> Is this duh deadly fire????
[6:25:18] <+dodge_and_dust> you probably need time stop first
[6:25:28] <captainthunderwolf> Can we just appreciate that we've reached the point where ambient sources like those torches have non-static lighting, in a top-down Western RPG of all things, and we barely even notice?
[6:25:33] <RubberFistFight> cheer200 Take my twitchbux you ginger fuck! TAKE THEM! Just want to let you know that your content partially inspired me to start streaming. So by your logic you are COMPLETELY RESPONSIBLE for me starting my own thing. Enjoy the 200 cents and don't spend it all at once.
[6:25:36] <captainthunderwolf> Like hot damn, guys. Games have moved forward.
[6:25:41] <+dodge_and_dust> those symbols look familer
[6:26:00] <StubYourToe> oh man
[6:26:02] <inderf> somehow i doubt this is a trial and error puzzle
[6:26:04] <deliciouspies> pat... you keep doing the same three combos
[6:26:06] <Cleverspambot> the puzzle hint is hidden on the top of the door frame
[6:26:16] <kortex64> it's be faster to take a second to think and resolve the puzzle
[6:26:20] <StubYourToe> theres gotta be a clue somewhere
[6:26:21] <$RubberFistFight> TIME STOP
[6:26:22] <startstoprepeat> just come back later with time stop.
[6:26:24] <VritraReiRei> Puzzles! BrokeBack
[6:26:26] <+G_Thunders> I think you need time stop for this one
[6:26:33] <%Slaardacity> Play old mcdonald!
[6:26:36] <captainthunderwolf> time stop
[6:26:44] <kibenator> The symbols you dingua
[6:26:45] <inderf> definitely need time stop
[6:26:45] <goatsaregoat> you need to figure out what those symbols mean
[6:26:46] <+dodge_and_dust> to bad you can't inspect the symbols to find out there meanind
[6:26:47] <Dozale> room on the right
[6:26:49] <kibenator> dingus
[6:26:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> You should read the symbols. They might mean something
[6:26:50] <SatansDick1> i think you need time stop for that puzzle
[6:26:54] <turbulentstriker> I noticed the torch reflected on the blue tiles
[6:26:55] <+dodge_and_dust> oh. well that is that puzzle solved
[6:26:57] <Vakojin> How many combinations of three symbols does that make to brute force ?
[6:27:04] <Peashooter117> T i m e S t o p
[6:27:13] <hippofant> @Vakojin 120
[6:27:24] <+arknodem> Audible gears grinding.
[6:27:28] <CatmanIX> Yeah, you definitely need timestop for this i bet
[6:27:29] <VritraReiRei> @Valask 6x5x4 which is 120
[6:27:32] <%Arxel1> T I M E S T O P

[6:28:06] <Cleverspambot> you are very smart pat
[6:28:07] <+arknodem> Ayyyyyyy
[6:28:08] <%Pendragwn> FUCKING LIGHT YOURSELF ON FIRE
[6:28:11] <goatsaregoat> suddenly the fire resets

[6:28:25] <+HanPaul> first try PogChamp
[6:28:25] <%Pendragwn> Suddenly the Stand user reveals himself

[6:28:51] <$RubberFistFight> Pat's butt has become one with the couch
[6:28:52] <Cleverspambot> you can "enchant" it to sharpen the blade pretty cheaply
[6:28:56] <deliciouspies> 6 hours of room temp swiss chese

[6:29:08] <ArcticAsylum> LUL
[6:29:13] <olliedelosa> Wait he still hasn't finished that cheese?
[6:29:16] <+arknodem> :O
[6:29:18] <$RubberFistFight> @deliciouspies - he is going to regret all that cheese.
[6:29:24] <+aagelaius> Welp, gotta admit that because of Pat, I’m planning on buying the first game
[6:29:26] <kibenator> SPOOK
[6:29:39] <Lee_The_Limey> dead people mostly
[6:29:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> Tell her more about the ghosts. It gets her wet.
[6:29:48] <%Mornaka> Soul party!
[6:29:50] <deliciouspies> @RubberFistFight I'm just sad about the cheese being out so long
[6:29:54] <Lee_The_Limey> no thanks
[6:29:56] <goatsaregoat> A ghost pirate ship
[6:30:00] <KTDelgado> MORE SOULS = BIGGER NUMBER
[6:30:03] <%ziriken> wait, did he take a bite of cheese? you cant eat cheese that's been left out this long
[6:30:03] <+Superstarsage> NO
[6:30:07] <%ziriken> he's gonna shit his pants
[6:30:07] <+Superstarsage> OH NO
[6:30:12] <turbulentstriker> "Dutiful" what does that mean?
[6:30:19] <crimsonharvest> SHe's YUNA?!?
[6:30:21] <deliciouspies> idk if it's still out, he had it at the start of the stream
[6:30:22] <$RubberFistFight> @deliciouspies - eh, being warm can change cheese flavour in a variety of interesting ways. Like, there are plenty of cheeses that are BEST served warm.
[6:30:27] <hippofant> @turbulentstriker Pat did something "dutiful", and Aloth approves of that.
[6:30:29] <kibenator> OHSHIT probably feeding satan or something
[6:30:31] <Lee_The_Limey> STOP JUDGING ME ALOTH
[6:30:32] <$RubberFistFight> Swiss is not one of them, but they do exist.
[6:30:39] <VectMachine> Country Rise is cute.
[6:30:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'm sure it's fiiiine.
[6:30:44] <turbulentstriker> Neat!
[6:30:45] <Bouldus> nobody cares what you think Aloth
[6:30:45] <%ziriken> warm isnt the same as left out though
[6:30:48] <AssKnapper> i dont feel so good mr pat
[6:30:49] <+Superstarsage> Wait what so did the souls get inside the watcher or the lantern
[6:30:51] <bleugh> r u winning son
[6:30:54] <deliciouspies> @RubberFistFight yeah I wasn't sure on the healt bar of this cheese, but it's probably red-caution by down
[6:30:56] <mr_slaide> She's basically Yuna, but less of a doormat.
[6:31:01] <$RubberFistFight> I turn 35 in 4 days and I DON'T WANNA
[6:31:01] <deliciouspies> now*
[6:31:02] <Dozale> Is it just me or is there aloth of humming coming from the stream?
[6:31:09] <+Nilbop> Wait, has he been streaming for 7 hours?
[6:31:14] <+dodge_and_dust> ha to leave after he got to that puzzle. did he find time stop to solve it?

[6:31:33] <goatsaregoat> Aloth needs his two gold per day
[6:31:34] <deliciouspies> did you put the cheese away?
[6:31:37] <antthefool> ALL YOUR MONEY FUKKR
[6:31:39] <%jiin6> Woolies taking your money
[6:31:40] <hippofant> @HanPaul His ship crew needs to be paid
[6:31:42] <turbulentstriker> Could pat have walked to the Governer Estate manually if he wanted too?
[6:31:49] <antthefool> Getting there
[6:31:49] <$RubberFistFight> FUCKEN WOOLIE
[6:31:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> Turn tricks on the corner to get your ship repaired!
[6:31:52] <+happyfunt1me> PopCorn PopCorn PopCorn PopCorn PopCorn PopCorn
[6:31:55] <+CaptainJax> you need more earned unpaid wages
[6:31:59] <+HanPaul> @hippofant jesus. this game goes all out
[6:32:11] <+Nilbop> Oh well, Istand correced.
[6:32:20] <hippofant> @HanPaul They also need food and drink. And gain/lose morale based on the quality of said food/drink.
[6:32:25] <$RubberFistFight> Seriously though, 35 seemed so goddamn far away when I was in my 20s but now it's like, next week. Getting old is bullshit, I seriously do not want it.
[6:33:07] <captainthunderwolf> @RubberFistFight The only thing you can do is pursue what you care about, man. Same as any other age.
[6:33:13] <deliciouspies> is getting old just a damage over time debuff?
[6:33:25] <KTDelgado> yes
[6:33:25] <StubYourToe> @RubberFistFight getting old sucks
[6:33:25] <count_bob> Yes
[6:33:33] <goatsaregoat> @RubberFistFight I desperately try not to think about it
[6:33:35] <+HanPaul> Getting old is a pre-existing condition
[6:33:38] <+dodge_and_dust> @deliciouspies no. it is a debuff to your stats that gets worse as time passes
[6:33:38] <%reave004> What kind of character are you going with in this playthrough Pat?
[6:33:40] <GarbageQueenEllie> I wish this Merchant Mayor would shut up so we can get back to the boat
[6:33:47] <StubYourToe> getting old is a aoe debuff overtime
[6:33:48] <$RubberFistFight> @captainthunderwolf - well that's why I started streaming. A little late, but yeah. I'd wanted to do it for a while, just never got around to it, made excuses, etc.
[6:34:04] <KTDelgado> lie
[6:34:06] <lankaster88> Lie
[6:34:14] <deliciouspies> as soon as we get on the boat it'll be a hiatus
[6:34:15] <%commanderclaw> Lie, Cheat, Steal
[6:34:25] <%ziriken> pat cant lie purposefully, only thru CT
[6:34:35] <$RubberFistFight> @goatsaregoat - I'm not sure what I'm more uncomfortable with; the idea of old age or the concept of my own mortality. I'm right up there with Pat's "I don't care even if I become a toilet so long as I continue" thing.
[6:34:44] <Iam_Dead> PAT PLZ
[6:34:47] <Iam_Dead> The best option
[6:34:48] <+Nilbop> Hey Rubber, treat it like I do man: one big hedonistic blur into the grave.
[6:34:53] <StubYourToe> I'm the reverse
[6:35:02] <deliciouspies> that's it
[6:35:04] <StubYourToe> death doesn't scare me much
[6:35:11] <$RubberFistFight> With the caveat that it has to be ME me, like the me that I AM - not a copy or a future iteration of me, or someone who thinks they're me but actually isn't.
[6:35:13] <deliciouspies> just age in reverse @RubberFistFight
[6:35:22] <%jiin6> I would never want to be toilet
[6:35:40] <Pulsin> Where's paige i rather watch paige eat macdonalds D:
[6:35:48] <deliciouspies> @jiin6 what if you were hitomi J-cup's toilet ?
[6:35:48] <hazardkujacker> no kikongo
[6:35:51] <$RubberFistFight> @deliciouspies - that could be handy if I could stop the process entirely when I reached say... 25.
[6:35:53] <Lee_The_Limey> NOW YOU FIGHT FOR CLARIO 4Head
[6:36:18] <$RubberFistFight> @Pulsin - you mean perform a post-mortem on the burger to extract the meat and throw away everything else?
[6:36:22] <StubYourToe> maybe CRISPR will make us all immortal
[6:36:24] <%jiin6> Nope
[6:36:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> Uuuugh finally. This asshole was going on forever
[6:36:32] <deliciouspies> fair
[6:36:35] <deliciouspies> poop is poop
[6:36:37] <%ziriken> @RubberFistFight i had a dream where i basically did the futurama royal honey infinite sleep. as soon as i took the last scoop, i had instant regret and thought of all the stuff i still wanted to do and woke up. so live life without regret
[6:36:40] <ArcticAsylum> "Ezio!....It's a me, MARIO!"
[6:36:42] <%ThePeacefulDream> Can you do WASD in this game?
[6:36:47] <Dozale> beach party tyme yo!
[6:36:47] <%WackyGear> he thinks your nuts
[6:36:51] <goatsaregoat> I love this game
[6:36:51] <Cleverspambot> grats on beating the game
[6:36:56] <mr_slaide> Big levels for big bois.
[6:36:57] <+griffball13> big huge
[6:37:02] <antthefool> Gotta kill that bitchass god statue for fucking up your house
[6:37:04] <$RubberFistFight> @ziriken - living life without regret is kind of impossible though, same as "live every day as if its your last"
[6:37:15] <$RubberFistFight> additionally, living that way will ensure that you reach your end MUCH FASTER
[6:37:23] <%ziriken> @RubberFistFight nah, im here and i dont regret it. deffinitely not "the fullest" necessary
[6:37:29] <Iam_Dead> Man, it's crazy how much visually nicer this looks then Pillars 1
[6:37:39] <%ziriken> @RubberFistFight my time is well spent here
[6:37:39] <$RubberFistFight> I LIKE being alive and aware. I would very much like to stay that way, and I hate knowing that I basically have a "use by" date.
[6:37:51] <deliciouspies> most of us, if not all, did not get a cjoice to come into this world
[6:37:56] <Wistelligence> man i come back and chat is having an existential crisis
[6:38:01] <+Nilbop> Look lads I thought you Americans were suppossed to be tough and science minded?It'll all be grand once we sort out telemaraze and cellular decay!
[6:38:05] <deliciouspies> choice of spelling correctly I still maintain though
[6:38:10] <StubYourToe> expiration date plus a best if used by date
[6:38:12] <%Slaardacity> i wish i could play stuff like this i always get overwhelmed with all of the stats and stuff
[6:38:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> I used to live in a castle. But then some asshole giant stomped everything into dust. Now the dumpster's all I've got
[6:38:17] <$RubberFistFight> @Wistelligence - eh, that's my brain most days I just try not to think about it.
[6:38:24] <goatsaregoat> What does explosives do?
[6:38:25] <Cleverspambot> xoti is big strong since you fixed her ai
[6:38:54] <%ziriken> even if it's just telling the people you care about that you're there for em, so if you died tomorrow, it wouldnt be so bad

[6:39:07] <Maverick2736> this background ost has a very specific part that makes me think of the "I keeeep hooolding on!" part from Simply Red's Holding Back the Tears

[6:39:21] <ArcticAsylum> Hmmmmmm
[6:39:29] <Maverick2736> and I don't even like that song
[6:39:30] <+dodge_and_dust> is there a max level in this game?
[6:39:31] <ArcticAsylum> Oh! I was absorbed in thought!
[6:39:40] <deliciouspies> 7? or 9
[6:39:43] <deliciouspies> o
[6:39:46] <Cleverspambot> its like 20 or something
[6:39:46] <%WackyGear> eder is best waifu
[6:39:47] <goatsaregoat> What happened to the tunnels underneath Caed Nua?
[6:39:51] <deliciouspies> k I'm thinkign skill tree maybe
[6:39:58] <roobanguy> i thought it was 16
[6:40:01] <Cleverspambot> the kickstarter said, it was part of stretch goals
[6:40:30] <Vakojin> This look like a real step up from the first one, impressive
[6:40:31] <lankaster88> Good ol fireball
[6:40:36] <GarbageQueenEllie> But someday, I'll kill that giant and rebuild my empire. Someday...
[6:40:41] <antthefool> Yo that mask is dapper as fuck
[6:40:46] <$RubberFistFight> good ol rock, nuthin beats that

[6:41:09] <deliciouspies> @AngriestPat do you enjoy punishing your blocks of cheese
[6:41:13] <%th3madness> the slow hunch always gets me
[6:41:31] <Cleverspambot> interrupt is nasty in this game
[6:41:48] <+dodge_and_dust> unless you get hit more then once in the casting time
[6:41:51] <Dozale> Don't copy Aloth! Be yourself!
[6:41:53] <+Nilbop> Controersial choice : Jaheirra is best
[6:41:55] <deliciouspies> fireball that asshole who got beat up
[6:41:57] <%WackyGear> fire kills everything, good choice
[6:42:01] <deliciouspies> infront of his kid even
[6:42:03] <$RubberFistFight> "let's throw this fireball at some dipshit" PAT YOU MURDERHOBO
[6:42:22] <Cleverspambot> only specific moves have interrupt, its not every hit anymore, but its a guarantee unless they have concentration
[6:42:27] <goatsaregoat> That looks fantastic
[6:42:30] <deliciouspies> no one saw that
[6:42:33] <lankaster88> DarkMode
[6:42:35] <deliciouspies> you get away with it
[6:42:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> Haha
[6:42:37] <ghostpalacio> muder
[6:42:37] <+dodge_and_dust> that makes sens

[6:42:47] <Belutima> WOW
[6:42:52] <+oSarg1010190> The blood god disapproves of this sorcerous display.
[6:42:52] <+dodge_and_dust> what else would happen to a random villager if you hit them with a FIREBALL
[6:42:53] <KTDelgado> NO ONE SAW, YIU DID NEED TO SAVE SCUM
[6:42:56] <crimsonharvest> Wizards: NO sense of right and wrong

[6:43:23] <+Nilbop> Can anyone in Toronto reccomend a good fried-food place at 10pm? I got needs.
[6:43:24] <hazardkujacker> Da beech
[6:43:26] <$RubberFistFight> @crimsonharvest - comeon man, if you could fling magic fire and had power beyond mortal reckoning, you'd go murder-crazy too.
[6:43:37] <$RubberFistFight> who'd stop you?
[6:43:48] <$RubberFistFight> You could just go WOLOLOLO and make them fight each other.
[6:43:49] <Bouldus> welp guess im making either a battle mage (poleaxe) or a spell blade (gun)
[6:43:52] <StubYourToe> ...
[6:43:59] <StubYourToe> oh
[6:44:00] <+dodge_and_dust> @RubberFistFight the army of men with crossbows?
[6:44:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> I wonder if you can use AOE spells to decimate the countryside
[6:44:09] <Cleverspambot> the mythical good guy with a gun would show up
[6:44:18] <$RubberFistFight> @dodge_and_dust - erect a magic force field that burns their arrows before they hit you.
[6:44:22] <crimsonharvest> This world map is very Fallout 1-2
[6:44:39] <+Nilbop> Bad? Do you mean this world map is very bad?
[6:44:40] <$RubberFistFight> If any powerful wizard gets taken down by weapons then they're basically not using their magic right.
[6:44:44] <+dodge_and_dust> @RubberFistFight the better wizard who DOES have a conscience?
[6:44:52] <Cleverspambot> for real though where is that kid you kidnapped? did everyone forget?
[6:45:03] <$RubberFistFight> @dodge_and_dust - eh, there's no need to bring unicorns into this.
[6:45:04] <crimsonharvest> hjell yeah i always look for ports that sell speed
[6:45:25] <Dovakhin573> so you get to be pirates in this game?
[6:45:32] <+Superstarsage> aw they didn't show it being freed
[6:45:32] <+BattleAlpaca> blessings are new game +
[6:45:32] <Wistelligence> oh my god it's called the defiant? i completely failed to notice that
[6:45:34] <Bouldus> @RubberFistFight i dont know if you know this, but that was a problem in pillars lore, and then the gun was invented and suddenly randos have the ability to kill mages under the right circumstance
[6:45:35] <goatsaregoat> @Dovakhin573 yes
[6:45:36] <lankaster88> Time to become king of the pirates
[6:45:38] <Iam_Dead> @RubberFistFight He doesn't even need a conscience. He could fight you to steal your shit/mooch of the townfolks
[6:45:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> YOU'RE ON A BOAT
[6:45:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> Steward-chan
[6:45:45] <hntronium> WHEN DO WE FUCK THE ROCK

[6:45:54] <+LogothX> Also you have dysentery
[6:45:57] <Lee_The_Limey> oh well
[6:45:59] <Vakojin> @AngriestPat Hello Pat. I have a question about the game. Did you have to rush to get your party members, or was it more organic ? I remember being a bit annoyed in the first one about that.
[6:45:59] <Dovakhin573> Time to sing some sea chanties lads
[6:46:02] <hippofant> You can tell the devs played Storms of Zehir
[6:46:05] <Solidus_113> where are the Legendary Ships that you can fight?
[6:46:12] <%commanderclaw> Berath's blessings, it's their version of NG+
[6:46:15] <+Nilbop> Are pirates more played-out than ninjas?
[6:46:18] <$RubberFistFight> @Iam_Dead - a good enough wizard would cast a spell on themselves to make anyone who tried to stand against them's brain explode.
[6:46:23] <%Mornaka> A H I P C O M B A T
[6:46:29] <%Mornaka> S H I P
[6:46:33] <$RubberFistFight> That's what I'm getting at - legitimately intelligent use of magic should be impossible to beat.
[6:46:42] <+Nilbop> No, you said HIP COMBAT, we all saw it
[6:46:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> BOAT BOAT BOAT BOAT
[6:46:47] <turbulentstriker> I wonder if this is like Sid Meier's Pirates!

[6:47:06] <Cleverspambot> yo dog you like numbers?
[6:47:08] <+dodge_and_dust> @RubberFistFight by that logic a good enough enemy wizard would cast a spell on themselves to prevent there brain from exploding
[6:47:11] <Vakojin> CAPTAIN ! LOOK !
[6:47:12] <%ziriken> the real sea of thieves
[6:47:14] <aslfrasle> This is just Sid Meier's Pirates.

[6:47:17] <%envy_780> One Piece?????????

[6:47:20] <+Nilbop> Is ahip like atypical?
[6:47:21] <goatsaregoat> I need this
[6:47:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> It's what I've always wanted
[6:47:22] <Solidus_113> WHERE'S THE SEA SHANTIES
[6:47:26] <hippofant> @crimsonharvest It's a pretty good one too, I think :D
[6:47:38] <leinadtonu> we FTL now?
[6:47:43] <olliedelosa> Is this finally the sequel to Black Flag that we've all been waiting for?
[6:47:46] <+Meiou> ok lets just make sure to find zoro first. i want his three sword fighting on our side
[6:47:50] <%Mornaka> pat's gonna be a warlord of the sea
[6:47:58] <%WackyGear> what devil fruit did pat eat?
[6:48:00] <Bouldus> boat king
[6:48:12] <$RubberFistFight> @dodge_and_dust - at best that would cause a stalemate
[6:48:17] <inderf> what the fuuuuuck is this game
[6:48:18] <%Mornaka> @WackyGear the wrong-wrong frit
[6:48:18] <$RubberFistFight> thus not invalidating my statement

[6:48:41] <StubYourToe> this game is bananas
[6:48:45] <BlindGato> Holy shit this is an entire game to itself
[6:48:46] <donpatrondx> gungun fruit is the best fruit
[6:48:50] <$spacehouse> PORT cannons lacking
[6:48:53] <+Nilbop> This mechanic feels ... needlessly complex?
[6:48:56] <$TheNeedlesD> Pat's a Navigator? Did he go to the future to find out his siblings had aged?
[6:48:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> Can we turn our boat into a BIGGER boat?
[6:48:58] <roobanguy> ah, the sequel to Sid Meiers Pirates
[6:48:59] <BronyOfTheFence> Jesus. That’s a lot of mechanics...
[6:49:04] <donpatrondx> your ship needs more gunguns
[6:49:07] <+dodge_and_dust> @RubberFistFight but your wizard has a spell to make anyone who stands against him's brain explode he would never expect anyone to stand against him WITHOUT exploding. thus he would be vulnrable and easily defeated
[6:49:09] <deviljhojho94> jive turkey
[6:49:12] <$spacehouse> just shove all ur food in that
[6:49:16] <ArcticAsylum> This game is too much for me
[6:49:17] <Cleverspambot> you need more cancons
[6:49:21] <Dovakhin573> So Come on board and bring along all your hopes and dreams.
[6:49:23] <hippofant> @GarbageQueenEllie I think you can get a bigger ship, yes.
[6:49:25] <Bouldus> jsut give them all the food its fine
[6:49:31] <deliciouspies> it's time to stop
[6:49:32] <dreu81> Jive actions
[6:49:33] <Dozale> U-turn
[6:49:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> @hippofant Sweet
[6:49:35] <leinadtonu> Are there sea shanties in this?
[6:49:35] <mr_slaide> Dah baby
[6:49:42] <BBnumber9> @AngriestPat Want to say thank you for getting me into the Yakuza series. I am playing 0 and loving every second of it!
[6:49:42] <deliciouspies> !swisscheese
[6:49:43] <deviljhojho94> RAFFLE DAZZLE
[6:49:46] <Cleverspambot> yeah if morale is high they sing
[6:49:48] <antthefool> Welp first thing we need is someone shout Gellarde while navigating the boat
[6:49:51] <olliedelosa> But where are the sea shanties?
[6:49:53] <$RubberFistFight> @dodge_and_dust - so just cast a spell to make himself immortal and indestrutible. If you can cast magic you can LITERALLY change the rules, so why the fuck wouldn't you?
[6:50:07] <%commanderclaw> I's pretty simple really
[6:50:07] <goatsaregoat> It is on gog
[6:50:08] <$RubberFistFight> Perform the magical equivalent of snapping the key off in the lock so nobody can undo what you've done.
[6:50:11] <lankaster88> It is
[6:50:17] <+Nilbop> Remember when pirates were hot, 10 years ago? YES I DO say Obsidian.
[6:50:25] <donpatrondx> i havent even finished the first game, and im already looking forward to becoming king of the pirates
[6:50:28] <%AbnormalVoid> goodbye streaming this game
[6:50:30] <$RubberFistFight> @dodge_and_dust - magicians "fighting fair" makes me fucking laugh my ass off.
[6:50:34] <deviljhojho94> goodbye VOD bois
[6:50:35] <+dodge_and_dust> @RubberFistFight but couldn't another mage cast a spell to make him mortal and killable AND kill him all in one go?
[6:50:35] <+TehBeerBaron> Thank God those guys are gone...

[6:50:51] <captainthunderwolf> Yes.
[6:50:51] <Captain_Joe1911> yes :D
[6:50:52] <deliciouspies> @AngriestPat did you ever put that swiss cheese back in the fridge, or is it still there?
[6:50:53] <goatsaregoat> Yes
[6:50:53] <mr_slaide> Yes
[6:50:54] <deviljhojho94> it was the good stream

[6:50:55] <Dovakhin573> no Kappa
[6:50:56] <captainthunderwolf> It was good!
[6:50:57] <StubYourToe> It was very delightful, sir.
[6:50:57] <+dodge_and_dust> it was ok
[6:50:58] <%WackyGear> sup
[6:50:58] <Ser_Randal> coward
[6:50:59] <Solidus_113> @AngriestPat please stream when you find Elmo
[6:50:59] <BlindGato> Good game

[6:51:01] <ArcticAsylum> Full LP on stream, no breaks. DO IT COWARD
[6:51:02] <+KoyaMusa> coward

[6:51:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> Tasty looking game
[6:51:10] <troxonal> Yes. It was a good stream.
[6:51:11] <count_bob> FULL LP YOU COWARD.
[6:51:12] <%Arxel1> It was like a good 5/10 Pat
[6:51:13] <Iam_Dead> @RubberFistFight Why would the mage have to kill you? Just launch the other mage into space.
[6:51:13] <deliciouspies> I need to know about your cheese situation
[6:51:13] <Bouldus> fucking do it though
[6:51:13] <Tjfmurphy> first stream
[6:51:17] <%AbnormalVoid> !rebel
[6:51:19] <StubYourToe> this would need 30 9 hour streams
[6:51:19] <%ziriken> so only do 3 24hr streams
[6:51:20] <deliciouspies> OH
[6:51:20] <Lee_The_Limey> is it !raffle time Kappa
[6:51:20] <$TheNeedlesD> you dont have to do 7-8 hour streams
[6:51:21] <Bouldus> ill watch it
[6:51:24] <Tjfmurphy> long first one XD
[6:51:25] <ULT_13> look at that not elmo
[6:51:26] <deviljhojho94> social eating stream
[6:51:28] <%th3madness> Definitely has higher production values than the first one
[6:51:30] <Wistelligence> That's understandable, dude. Streaming takes energy.
[6:51:31] <%Mornaka> We need more cheese
[6:51:33] <GarbageQueenEllie> Finding Elmo
[6:51:33] <deliciouspies> wait he completed the cheese
[6:51:34] <+KoyaMusa> pat give up on tactics
[6:51:34] <%th3madness> and no obsidian bugs
[6:51:35] <%whistlehunter> Yes
[6:51:36] <ArcticAsylum> DO THE DO IT
[6:51:37] <olliedelosa> We need to find Elmo though
[6:51:38] <lankaster88> Elmos a late game hidden boss

[6:51:42] <Ser_Randal> No promises tho
[6:51:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> LUL

[6:51:45] <crimsonharvest> Pat are there any old games you want to replay? I can't stop thinking about Deus Ex 1.
[6:51:47] <ArcticAsylum> LUL
[6:51:47] <+dodge_and_dust> you could keep doing it till yoyu don't feel like doing it
[6:51:49] <+Nilbop> If J J Oppenheimer ssaid he didn't have 10 more 7 hour streams in him then we wouldn't have the atomic bomb
[6:51:50] <lankaster88> DO IT GIVE IN
[6:51:50] <Cleverspambot> i hope we atleast get a followup tomorrow
