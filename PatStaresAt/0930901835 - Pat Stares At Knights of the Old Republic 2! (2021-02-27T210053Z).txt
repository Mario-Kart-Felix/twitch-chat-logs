[0:23:49] <dankula_oe> the stream is super buggy for me right now
[0:23:58] <%AncelDeLambert> is this like some weird dumbass video game version of modern art college?
[0:23:59] <lotusdagoat> fail states are a failure on the game design
[0:24:01] <%JoshManVGH> What could it be!?
[0:24:04] <+Veraverse> @dankula_oe fine here
[0:24:10] <marvel877> anyone got a link to that?
[0:24:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> Are we the bad games?
[0:24:15] <%TheMattman1313> The school of Immersion over everything
[0:24:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Did you clean the video game meme pool
[0:24:17] <%Dementedpenguin> I guess he hates Alien Soldier
[0:24:18] <+eanscrale> Don't like games?
[0:24:19] <%AncelDeLambert> who the FUCK is teaching design?
[0:24:20] <lotusdagoat> HACKS
[0:24:21] <datKado> is that how bad games get made?
[0:24:26] <LVL1_Scumbag> If you can't do, teach

[0:24:32] <%psidefx> Smooth brain takes
[0:24:34] <+corrosivePaladin> pls tell me he was bullied for that take
[0:24:35] <%AncelDeLambert> did... they not see how popular Dark Souls is?
[0:24:38] <%Ipsenscastle> Game Dev and Game Academia are completely separate beasts, it's the fucking worst
[0:24:40] <%Nekros4442> Boss Fights are fucking hype. Screw those people
[0:24:43] <arcturus_26> definitely dumbest
[0:24:44] <Wan6Saber> they should speak for themselves, for once!
[0:24:46] <+Veraverse> My favorite DMC is 2, cause there's no boss fights!
[0:24:53] <+Dova573> Bad boss fights bad,  good boss fights Good
[0:25:04] <marvel877> Camera focus
[0:25:04] <%JoshManVGH> Anti-Monster Hunter reviewer right there.
[0:25:07] <%Fien111> "Escort Missions are always bad!" Wing Commander, Freespace, and X-Wing would like a fucking word
[0:25:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> FOR A GOOD REASON
[0:25:12] <+Veraverse> Imagine MGR without boss fights
[0:25:14] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck no wonder the industry sucks ass
[0:25:15] <+eanscrale> Who doesn't want to kick their bosses's teeth in
[0:25:17] <lotusdagoat> boss fights are based and redpilled
[0:25:19] <alextrebeken> its expected to have them
[0:25:23] <+EkinRaider> tbf look at which games are most popular now DansGame
[0:25:29] <+captain_thickthighs> that same coworker is the guy that says no one likes foreplay
[0:25:32] <$alliedmastercompy> after such a logical failure, the easier answer is to look at the premises of the argument.
[0:25:34] <%rawrmeowxd> Escort missions are probably the worst
[0:25:34] <+eanscrale> The flight games had bosses too
[0:25:35] <%Fien111> It's 90% of flight games
[0:25:36] <%AncelDeLambert> escort missions are always bad... WHEN YOU DESIGN THEM LAZILY
[0:25:42] <%AzureGale> Because having to append EVERY SINGLE ONE of their sentences with "I think..."  instead of it being implicitly understood would be tiring
[0:25:45] <%wibbwobbler> LUL
[0:25:50] <RodCU> You can punch Escorts in GTA
[0:25:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Boss fights are notoriously hard to make but pay DEVIDENS
[0:25:57] <%rawrmeowxd> LUL
[0:25:57] <+Veraverse> LUL
[0:26:03] <%psidefx> Collective drying ensues
[0:26:09] <+Dova573> oh you da bad sex
[0:26:15] <%JoshManVGH> Their significant other just stares ahead, dead inside
[0:26:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> Could it be that there is no "bad" or "good" game mechanics and it's up to the developers to make the mechanics interesting?
[0:26:23] <%rawrmeowxd> Yea no one likes getting head. I mean come on LUL
[0:26:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> COULD IT POSSIBLY BE?!
[0:26:26] <+captain_thickthighs> oh do I have stories for you then
[0:26:27] <alextrebeken> foreplay ruins your speedrun
[0:26:30] <chicken_apostle> Haha this guy don't fuck
[0:26:31] <+AH_Steve17> local one guy admits to being awful at the sex
[0:26:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> Escort missions can suck if the person moves faster then your walk speed and slower then your sprint
[0:26:34] <Blank9> Dude, everybody loves Coldplay.
[0:26:36] <arcturus_26> Escort missions are bad. But games that have implemented as a mechanic like bioshock infinite can be pretty good. but then it's more like companion than a escort.
[0:26:36] <%AzureGale> @Too_Much_Nukie Gacha
[0:26:44] <+Veraverse> "Yes but actually no"
[0:26:48] <%Broken_Sonex> Just don't be one of those people who just want the foreplay and not the actual sex because they think it's better.
[0:26:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> Even gacha can be fun!
[0:26:49] <+Dova573> such as
[0:26:51] <Ginganinja4545> Gacha is bad civilization
[0:26:53] <%wibbwobbler> i can get down with that
[0:26:53] <LVL1_Scumbag> Like tank controls
[0:26:58] <+eanscrale> Yeah I play genshin and I hate gacha
[0:27:03] <+eanscrale> no one likes gacha
[0:27:04] <%JoshManVGH> Weapon Durability can be reeeeally bad
[0:27:05] <%Mrbaconator> that guy in chat is right foreplay ruins the sex speedrun how are you supposed to PB without foreplay skip
[0:27:09] <dumahiem> first you got to lick that fur burger
[0:27:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> Use in-game currency to remove the real-life gambling element, give guaranteed drops throughout the game.
[0:27:16] <%rawrmeowxd> that's a pretty bad one yea
[0:27:16] <+corrosivePaladin> stuns in a competative fps game is always bad
[0:27:25] <chicken_apostle> Cameras in video games? YUCK. Get rid of them
[0:27:25] <SiameseSneeze> yeah, it's poopy garbage
[0:27:26] <+oktavia_von> i hate jumping puzzle in fps
[0:27:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> If your character is RIGHT INFRONT OF THE CAMERA yeah
[0:27:30] <derekwst3> thats why we need yugioh in our lives
[0:27:36] <ScreamLord> Crash Bandicoot
[0:27:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> There's good ones in Crash though.
[0:27:41] <ScreamLord> Oh
[0:27:43] <Wan6Saber> dissing Crash Bandicoot LUL
[0:27:53] <%valcheese> Crash Bandicoot!!!
[0:27:53] <%AzureGale> U2's truck scene was awesome
[0:27:55] <%rawrmeowxd> All the ones in RE are pretty trash
[0:28:00] <%JoshManVGH> Running towards camera with random blocks right infront of you ooooh maneuver around our running puzzle
[0:28:00] <+eanscrale> It was popular to do cause it feels like breaking the rules
[0:28:00] <%twoto858> I was just about to mention that scene
[0:28:03] <+Veraverse> There's a good run to the camera and then not and then run in Uncharted 4
[0:28:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> Crash bandicoot has a few good ones there are a few others
[0:28:10] <%Ipsenscastle> U2 truck was rad
[0:28:11] <+corrosivePaladin> what about crash levels that run towards the camera?
[0:28:12] <+Bail_Seven> i dont think he likes those crash lvls guys
[0:28:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> RE2Make Crock fight
[0:28:22] <RodCU> My least favorite mechanic is blocking with a button in modern MK games
[0:28:26] <+captain_thickthighs> @mrbaconator so is the sex speed run for you, the partner, or the impregnation
[0:28:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> True
[0:28:29] <%AzureGale> Crash is the progenitor of the bad running towards camera scenes
[0:28:32] <Ginganinja4545> Wait XBC2 has gacha thats fine because its not intrusive and cant be paid for
[0:28:43] <whimsicallifestyle> how about the first sonic stage of sonic adventure 2 battle?
[0:28:43] <%wibbwobbler> not a not really a fan of when crash does it lol
[0:28:44] <%valcheese> it forces you to remember the level
[0:28:46] <%TheMattman1313> Running towards the camera becomes a memory test where knowing when/where to jump based on all of the previous times to die is the only "skill"
[0:28:51] <%AncelDeLambert> huh, Pat actually used "exception that proves" correctly
[0:28:59] <Aydarkzero> but i like running away from boulders LUL
[0:29:00] <Too_Much_Nukie> The ones in Crash 1 are genuinely better.
[0:29:06] <%Mrbaconator> @captain_thickthighs of course it's not impregnation you use the fetus to clip through the wall to the last boss which undoes the pregnancy
[0:29:09] <+Veraverse> LUL
[0:29:11] <%AzureGale> ok
[0:29:19] <%AncelDeLambert> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[0:29:25] <%SaiyanShoto> For a second I though that yellow thing behind the couch was a Psyduck LUL LUL
[0:29:30] <+LunarDensetsu> i made it
[0:29:32] <%Dementedpenguin> Thanks, Pat.
[0:29:35] <Aydarkzero> i know some things! Kappa
[0:29:36] <chicken_apostle> That one part of that one sonic game where you run away from the truck is pretty dope
[0:29:37] <+eanscrale> That's depressing.
[0:29:38] <%valcheese> oh fuck yeah
[0:29:40] <+ThomasOfTroy> "Just make a good game and don't be stupid"
[0:29:42] <BluBox> Thank you :)
[0:29:42] <%SaiyanShoto> I’m smrt
[0:29:43] <RodCU> "Don't use delay based netcode you dummies"
[0:29:44] <SoaringTrumpet> what makes you say that?
[0:29:44] <+captain_thickthighs> Well to game design 101: Is it fun
[0:29:45] <%AncelDeLambert> I am super depressed to learn that game design academia is going down the EXACT same path as animation
[0:29:49] <%UvBenServed> Maybe not teach, but I can contribute by pointing and laughinh
[0:29:50] <%Ipsenscastle> I am so smurt
[0:29:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt I've had to steer my bosses from making bad decisions in VR Game Training simulations
[0:29:56] <+Dova573> I would be such a shit, I would be like THAST WRONG YOU OLD FUCK
[0:30:02] <+D00msDayDan> i had a lecture once in college from a fella who seemed like he knew what he was talking about in level design
[0:30:04] <+corrosivePaladin> I had a professor that had a Ace of Spaces ripoff up on kickstarter and spent more time shilling their game then actually teaching
[0:30:05] <%rawrmeowxd> Pat spitting some facts tho
[0:30:08] <MonsterGills> What is infront of steve?
[0:30:08] <+MassConnect> but I don't know how to make graphics and controller inputs happen simultaneously
[0:30:10] <%Ynkubus_> Half my uni teachers were awful and the other half were great, it was fun seeing them grumble about each other
[0:30:14] <+khazdee> good game design is about marketability :D
[0:30:17] <%AzureGale> I mean, you could talk to them instead of insulting them
[0:30:18] <+eanscrale> You would think!
[0:30:19] <+crazyspartan214> tre'
[0:30:21] <%Ynkubus_> In terms of my 3d course
[0:30:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AncelDeLambert almost all education is going down the fucking drain
[0:30:23] <dumahiem> first you got to get the nerds together then you got a chain into the desk then you tell him it's crunch time eventually you get video game design o
[0:30:23] <Ginganinja4545> My game design teacher used to work for Activision.  He stopped because he was like "wait its activision fuck"
[0:30:25] <Wan6Saber> YES

[0:30:31] <+oktavia_von> omggg
[0:30:32] <%Dementedpenguin> Oh
[0:30:35] <+Veraverse> Playing games without good boss fights is an achievement. Not a good one, but goddamn
[0:30:36] <%Ipsenscastle> aww
[0:30:37] <+captain_thickthighs> You ever had a teacher with bad taste?
[0:30:40] <Aydarkzero> \bummer
[0:30:43] <%AkronymCLT> My 3D animation teacher worked on infinity war and I felt bad because no one in my year wanted to do 3D
[0:30:44] <arcturus_26> that fish will never swim again
[0:30:47] <%TDotGoat> Karpmo, soon to be Trashmo
[0:30:50] <bob900000> noooooo
[0:30:51] <+oktavia_von> just cut that bit off
[0:30:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> You know what my favorite moment in games is? When you finally reach the boss fight with a character that uses abilities similar to the player where you get the chance to prove you've mastered the mechanics.
[0:30:56] <BluBox> Same
[0:30:57] <%UvBenServed> Sick

[0:31:11] <abelincoln_catpuncher> I mean, can you blame them?
[0:31:14] <+oktavia_von> my music teacher just put on horror moives
[0:31:14] <%maenos2> I had this bitch of a music teacherwho years later was found passed put in class from booze
[0:31:16] <+Veraverse> I had a teacher that said that the holocaust was greatly exaggerated. He then turned out to be a pedophile
[0:31:17] <+AH_Steve17> the mental breakdown teachers are somethin
[0:31:20] <%GarbageNirvana> I had a high school statistics teacher who didn't think 9/11 was a big deal when it was happening
[0:31:25] <%Garthunox> glad to see im late but still on time
[0:31:31] <+Dova573> I had a match teacher, that look like a super jock, but was the nerdiest comic book nerd

[0:31:36] <dumahiem> they weren't drunk in class they were drunk in life
[0:31:42] <%AzureGale> Teachers are SUCH an underappreciated job, man
[0:31:42] <Wan6Saber> yes it is, Paige. SHUT UP
[0:31:43] <%Dementedpenguin> @Veraverse NotLikeThis
[0:31:43] <Blank9> it's true
[0:31:44] <%Ynkubus_> No Peach, let him dounk on them
[0:31:48] <RodCU> Swimming teachers probably drown all the time
[0:31:51] <%AkronymCLT> @doc_ock_rokc yeah he seemed kinda bummed about it
[0:31:53] <%Ipsenscastle> teachers get fucked over, especially in COVID times, it's awful
[0:31:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AkronymCLT I got this experimental fuck of a professor rather then the ex Dreamcast animator who left because of the experimental fuck when I FINALLY got a class with him
[0:32:00] <%rawrmeowxd> Pat going big brain
[0:32:00] <+captain_thickthighs> I had an art teacher that on liked classical watercolors, like an other form or art the could not stomach. and of course you have nothing to do that they had a watercolor shop.
[0:32:00] <%miguelrod777> what
[0:32:02] <arcturus_26> yeah I was just about to say
[0:32:09] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @AncelDeLambert I've went to animation school myself and even though the fundamentals are pretty important, some of the teachers are very stuck in their ways.
[0:32:10] <+Freakin_Wolfy> such valuable insight
[0:32:10] <LVL1_Scumbag> Those who can't teach, administrate

[0:37:00] <%gitgouda> lol
[0:37:02] <+captain_thickthighs> dude even my barber wants to get into strive. if I get good enough hopefully I can bet my cuts for Free
[0:37:09] <+twohitgood> i think fighting games are like learning a language. you need it to be simple first while people learn how to express then you can add complexities later in the lifecycle.
[0:37:11] <RodCU> And Eddie apparently doesn't suck in Strive
[0:37:20] <%maenos2> da netcode
[0:37:22] <Jaysky> Strive is gorgeous looking
[0:37:27] <+twohitgood> Oda
[0:37:30] <%tinyswampthing> and xrds pc port is broken too
[0:37:35] <arcturus_26> I saw nothing
[0:37:35] <%SveriSageAdvice> Xrd was great and would've been better if it wasnt for the fact i can never get a lobby because the netcode sucks
[0:37:37] <+twohitgood> oda posted about rollback
[0:37:40] <anAngryHamster> 'Had had' had had a greater effect
[0:37:41] <BluBox> Strive is cool but I do legit wish Xrd could have had good netcode
[0:37:47] <%SveriSageAdvice> for now, Parsec is how i have to play Xrd
[0:37:53] <%maenos2> Mr. nobunaga
[0:37:55] <+captain_thickthighs> get you one girl that's got the netcode folks
[0:37:58] <%Nekros4442> So we're all gonn assume the reason why Rollback was a blacklisted word at the roundtable was cus of Bamco right?
[0:38:02] <majindusto> ODA
[0:38:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> oDA NOBUNAGA?

[0:38:19] <+Dova573> Kappa
[0:38:24] <+wmeldrum> i'm convinced harada hates the community
[0:38:26] <ScreamLord> The guy that Japan Loves/Hates that help unify the country 500+ year ago and keep making games about
[0:38:30] <%wibbwobbler> snk?? that's wild

[0:38:46] <arcturus_26> BITCH
[0:38:46] <+captain_thickthighs> what if we just game rollback a japanese name
[0:38:54] <+Dova573> Honestly the best change for roll back would be for tekken 8
[0:38:58] <%spitelite> he cant see the rollback his shades are too dark
[0:38:59] <+Dova573> chance
[0:38:59] <%WhereIsWill> but what if tifa for tekken tho
[0:39:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> If you really love it you would play with shitty netcode Kappa
[0:39:10] <+twohitgood> are there any 3d fighting games with rollback?
[0:39:12] <majindusto> COME ON SAKURAI TOO

[1:29:45] <%asgard147> better
[1:29:51] <%Broken_Sonex> @Alazull SHE DOES
[1:30:01] <%SaiyanShoto> Is Lincoln just a sith ghost?
[1:30:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> This convo is balls lmao
[1:30:10] <@PeachSaliva> I love Star Trek, I just pretend it’s nighttime.
[1:30:11] <anAngryHamster> Remind me, is Mira just dead?
[1:30:30] <%rawrmeowxd> yes @SaiyanShoto
[1:30:34] <%Broken_Sonex> @PeachSaliva Wh-....What are you....?
[1:30:42] <ItsJustThatSimp_le> unless they're into that kind of thing
[1:30:44] <+Midashu> It's always the night shift on Star Trek
[1:30:47] <+EdHeng> @PeachSaliva space is not real
[1:30:49] <Goodvibes99508> i think that conversation was a DOT it feels like pat is taking damage after saying the word space
[1:30:51] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> what
[1:30:57] <Shining_Armor> Paige has to be trolling us
[1:31:06] <dumahiem> page tell the ghost of Lincoln to let your people go
[1:31:21] <%Broken_Sonex> She is but it's fun to play along
[1:31:24] <%logoth_> T3 ruining the scene
[1:31:31] <abelincoln_catpuncher> see you tonight @PeachSaliva
[1:31:44] <%rawrmeowxd> Idk everything this wookie is talking about sounds fake. Maybe Paige was right
[1:31:54] <%logoth_> The Shadowlands is a place where bad expansion takes place
[1:31:59] <Shining_Armor> @Broken_Sonex Ok that's a relief because I couldn't tell. I have an aunt who, apparently, thinks space is made of water.
[1:32:10] <%SaiyanShoto> I’m still taking damage from everything Paige said
[1:32:18] <%Alazull> Paige afraid of the Shadowlands confirmed
[1:32:23] <TurtlesAndTentacles> the first thing I hear is a wookie lol
[1:32:27] <%dekkitout> Kae'Ryn: "You mean space?" Hanhaar: "I don't like to think of it"
[1:32:40] <%Broken_Sonex> @Shining_Armor You should introduce her to Paige! They'd get along well.
[1:33:06] <%shurtal> Hanharr developing his hate boner early i see
[1:33:13] <Shining_Armor> @Broken_Sonex "I'm scared of space!" - Paige "Don't worry, it's just water" - My Aunt
[1:33:13] <pedrinoj> where do space ships travel?
[1:33:18] <ChungusQuest> Dignity Chicken inflicts a DoT?
[1:33:23] <@commanderclaw> Fun Fact: they couldn't make Hanharr a Sith cause Lucas at the time said Wookies couldn't be jedi
[1:33:31] <%rawrmeowxd> Omikron???
[1:33:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> you must travel to the nearest star war
[1:33:54] <%Arweynn> you should have been sent to dxun by now
[1:33:59] <%dekkitout> @commanderclaw Well guess what we got now Kappa
[1:34:15] <%maenos2> I thought you went to dxunalready but I guess not
[1:34:19] <%Broken_Sonex> @commanderclaw Why? Why can't the carpet be force man?
[1:34:19] <%Arweynn> might need to turn in the telos station quests?

[1:34:45] <%Arweynn> T3 is supposed to tell you to go to dxun when it's time for the end
[1:34:47] <LVL1_Scumbag> It's not real, Pat
[1:34:52] <LVL1_Scumbag> Everyone lied to you
[1:34:57] <LVL1_Scumbag> Space is a myth
[1:34:59] <olaksi> chat didn't even have a response to that joke huh
[1:35:01] <Goodvibes99508> keep up the attack if she has a panic attack you win
[1:35:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> Paiges refusal to acknowledge space might be the hardest hitting lore of all time

[1:35:40] <%Arweynn> WRYYYY-set

[1:36:18] <%maenos2> SPACE LINCOLNIS PISSED
[1:36:19] <Shining_Armor> Stupid question, how does Paige feel about the "Space Bar"? Does it remind her of actual space or does she not mind?
[1:36:23] <%JoshManVGH> He should have apologized!
[1:36:32] <Too_Much_Nukie> YOU HAVE PAID THE PRICE FOR YOUR LACK OF VISION

[1:37:37] <%rawrmeowxd> ITS THE GHOST OF LINCOLN DX GET THE SAGE
[1:37:44] <%Broken_Sonex> MAN, this game was made in 14 months
[1:37:50] <olaksi> i think it's more realistic if they don't make sound
[1:38:03] <%The_Protagonist> Big Evil is Pat's brand
[1:38:08] <%SaiyanShoto> Quick give ghost Lincoln a 5 dollar bill
[1:38:12] <+captain_thickthighs> I'm back from making fallafal what I mixed
[1:38:14] <Shining_Armor> Big evil is a band name

[1:39:24] <%Mrbaconator> it's THE BEST PART
[1:39:28] <%wibbwobbler> good stuff
[1:39:29] <+D00msDayDan> pre-stream is the best part
[1:39:31] <%rawrmeowxd> the pregame stuff is the hypest lol
[1:39:33] <+ThomasOfTroy> And god bless that mini-podcast, it's the best part
[1:39:51] <derekwst3> @PatStaresAt is that Lincoln behind you?
[1:39:53] <Shining_Armor> Paige casts "Whispers of the eldritch", you can no longer comprehend space.
[1:40:13] <olaksi> pat doesn't care about the homeless?
[1:40:14] <%Arancet> and theyre waiting for you
[1:40:14] <%Alazull> And they are coming
[1:40:18] <%Alazull> Coming for you
[1:40:19] <%dekkitout> Accept your fears
[1:40:24] <%SaiyanShoto> They’re at your door Pat
[1:40:25] <%shurtal> I dun wanna believe, the mottow of the Zed Files
[1:40:33] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah but space will never come at you, so you can disbelieve in it.
[1:40:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> NO SHUT UP THO
[1:40:40] <+corrosivePaladin> I miss T poses
[1:40:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> THIS PART OF THE GAME ISN'T BROKEN YOU'RE IMAGINING THINGS
[1:40:44] <Ashrox117> Legit why my head is on a swivel walking my dog downtown
[1:40:45] <%JoshManVGH> wai
[1:40:56] <ChungusQuest> I actually like hearing people say they're uncomfortable with the topic of space, because that means on some level they truly appreciate its enormity and grandeur
[1:41:08] <+gustavozxd> the avengers movie KomodoHype
[1:41:39] <%za7az> The horror aspect is that normal reality is often terrifying
[1:42:13] <Shining_Armor> @ChungusQuest But space is just a bunch of rocks, explosions, burning gas and vacuum balls.
[1:42:36] <ChungusQuest> yeah, and that's metal as fuck!
[1:42:43] <%JoshManVGH> @za7az That's very true. biology is especially prevalent to that point in these Times
[1:42:46] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt You get extra stuff here if you choose one of your jedi characters to lead the jungle squad
[1:42:55] <%rawrmeowxd> it's also full of ghosts of dead presidents @Shining_Armor
[1:43:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt One of your apprentices. Jedi or Sith.
[1:43:18] <Too_Much_Nukie> Visas, Atton, Bao-Dur. Any will do.
[1:43:26] <%Broken_Sonex> Yeah, send in the Goth PAWG
[1:43:30] <Shining_Armor> @rawrmeowxd Of course, it's where Lincoln hides! Paige would never find him there.
[1:43:41] <Aydarkzero> pick the cool teammates
[1:43:44] <Too_Much_Nukie> Trust Kreia's judgement here.
[1:43:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> She tells you if you made bad choices.
[1:43:55] <%JoshManVGH> Wouls she get Dark Side Points if she just burns down the jungle planet?
[1:43:58] <%rawrmeowxd> shhhh don't say his name three times DX @Shining_Armor
[1:44:02] <+MaitrePielle> are veins an indicator for the presence of evil
[1:44:04] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah
[1:44:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> You did.
[1:44:08] <Shining_Armor> Pat what was your horror game Idea?
[1:44:16] <%Dunmarkh> sound good
[1:44:16] <Shining_Armor> You got side tracked
[1:44:17] <%MugenSandan> Lincoln Lincoln Lincoln
[1:44:18] <Aydarkzero> that second one sounded unsure
[1:44:30] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[1:44:32] <tranquilturnip> so clocktower
[1:44:34] <Aydarkzero> is he visible?
[1:44:35] <tranquilturnip> but with a syringe
[1:44:40] <%psidefx> Gotta keep moving at all times
[1:44:42] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Now thats horror
[1:44:43] <Shining_Armor> So "It Follows" but the demon is a homeless man?
[1:44:44] <faithless_zealot> Too much tention, not enough release
[1:44:48] <LVL1_Scumbag> So you play as an anti-vaxxer?
[1:44:52] <+Catpurnicus> is that a top hat peeking around the corner
[1:44:53] <%dekkitout> Can the game be modded so the hobo is Abe Lincoln?
[1:44:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> The Bao-Dur choice depends on if he's trained or not. If he's not a jedi yet Kreia thinks he shouldn't go on the jungle expedition. If he has been trained as a jedi or sith she thinks it's a good idea.
[1:44:57] <%psidefx> Just followed by a slow moving syringe
[1:45:03] <$TallYoda08> LUL
[1:45:15] <faithless_zealot> Lol, sounds like Pat's personal nightmare
[1:45:18] <%rawrmeowxd> that's way too spooky pat

[1:45:25] <BoneBagMel> OH NO
[1:45:26] <Aydarkzero> he's wasting the serum!
[1:45:27] <$SGrim> Durst rolling with needle
[1:45:29] <Shining_Armor> Man this idea just prints money
[1:45:29] <+Catpurnicus> at least they are getting the air bubbles out
[1:45:30] <%dekkitout> LuvUok
[1:45:30] <%rawrmeowxd> This sounds like my ex
[1:45:34] <BoneBagMel> loloollo
[1:45:35] <+CookieCutter007> is he a heroin addict
[1:45:37] <SomeoneNamedAaron> it's just one of those days
[1:45:37] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Yeah that's pretty fucked
[1:45:38] <LVL1_Scumbag> So what happens when he catches you?
[1:45:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> Kreia thinks any of the droids are a bad choice for the jungle. Pretty sure she thinks Hanharr is bad too.
[1:45:46] <%JoshManVGH> A regular sized 10mL syringe? or a gaint cartoonish syringe?
[1:45:49] <%psidefx> "NOW I KNOW YALL BE FEELING THIS ISH RIGHT HERE"
[1:45:49] <Shining_Armor> ^
[1:45:52] <%dekkitout> Remari is now on that as wee speak

[1:50:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> So this part has a ton of restored content and also unique dialogue based on who went on either mission. It was one of the most broken parts of the game prior to restored content mod.
[1:50:55] <Shining_Armor> Pat if you had force powers would you honestly become a sith or would you just be a grey with dark side tendencies?
[1:50:57] <+ThomasOfTroy> Why is Elmo grandpa now? I thought he was the older step-brother?

[1:51:31] <Fabpsi_> pat would still be pat but with force powers. So he can force pet his animals
[1:51:31] <Shining_Armor> I've never felt guilt in my life.

[1:51:38] <Fabpsi_> he would be the ultimate pet-jedi

[1:51:45] <Huntercd> Just dont feel guilty @PatStaresAt
[1:51:49] <%Broken_Sonex> Not really. Sounds like it sucks having guiltthough
[1:51:54] <Shining_Armor> ^
[1:52:04] <Shining_Armor> Guilt is like space, don't think about it.
[1:52:04] <penitentpendant> The temptation to force persuade teachers "You get one." would be hard to fight

[1:52:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> So. Remember how I JUST SAID this part was one of the most broken parts of the game?
[1:52:38] <+Catpurnicus> how much damage do the mines do in cutscene land
[1:52:41] <Fabpsi_> would love to see him running into allll the mines in the background
[1:52:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> camera broken

[2:02:45] <OldManDeckardCain> mugen*
[2:02:52] <%DashXero> It's like Bushido Blade with HEMA.
[2:02:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> I love that line "He sensed a 'disturbance in the force'. What does that even mean? How am I supposed to prepare for that?!"
[2:03:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Polish Bushido? wow
[2:03:09] <%Broken_Sonex> Eww, Woolie is spraying the gunk out The Hole onto this stream.
[2:04:06] <falikk> force storm is op as hell
[2:04:09] <%SvenHolgersson> Sith op man
[2:04:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> It can be if you bring the wrong people with the wrong builds.
[2:04:11] <goose_coward> so this is the power of the dark side?
[2:04:13] <%SvenHolgersson> What can I say
[2:04:34] <Fabpsi_> the dark side should really work on their energy generators
[2:04:44] <Fabpsi_> like, those are not secure at all
[2:05:03] <Too_Much_Nukie> Honestly it feels like this was supposed to be the halfway point of the game and not the 3 quarter mark. I don't know if that's true but it's the impression I get.
[2:05:20] <%RaziWraith> the running with that double-bladed lightsaber LUL
[2:05:34] <%Chryses_> Playing the Outriders demo. I think square has another Marvel's Avengers like bomb. Back to back smh
[2:05:48] <joliorn> it´s still bweetter than everything on malakor 5
[2:06:09] <%Daxalog> Like avengerss? Or Anthem?
[2:06:12] <%StrawberryPantsu> I LIKED AVENGERS BETA THOUGH!
[2:06:12] <+dante_must_die_exe> Avengers was a shit show LUL
[2:06:21] <$Futurecity10> From what I saw, it looks to be a rip off of Remnant
[2:06:22] <%RaziWraith> Avengers didn't have to be shitty. :(
[2:06:24] <%ChrisPlaysThing> But Hellgate was alright, just old as fuck looking
[2:06:26] <@commanderclaw> Outriders at least looks fun for 35 hours of it's main campaign even if it doesn't become a "forever game"
[2:06:29] <Too_Much_Nukie> Outriders looks like something I could actually enjoy playing. Where as Avengers looked like trash from the start.
[2:06:30] <%ChrisPlaysThing> the writing was solid
[2:06:35] <%SvenHolgersson> The only thing that one upped Avengers was Cyberpunk
[2:06:43] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Luscious Aldin is the shit
[2:06:46] <%JoshManVGH> It's not a live service, so it should be a blast
[2:06:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> Avengers is worse than Cyberpunk.
[2:06:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> By a wide margin.
[2:07:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Free those nadds
[2:07:12] <+Houndemise> I was so glad when you said it's not a service game, Pat
[2:07:17] <%RaziWraith> How do I defeat them? With these hands! :)
[2:07:19] <+Houndemise> I do not like that trend
[2:07:24] <%Noir_Valdr> playing the Outriders demo now. It seems solid and fun to me.
[2:07:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> Part of the reason I feel like this is supposed to be the halfway mark is this is the first time you fight dark jedi.
[2:07:30] <%wibbwobbler> yep
[2:07:30] <+MaitrePielle> pat needs help to pee
[2:07:32] <goose_coward> put the boots to them
[2:07:35] <$The_AngryHoogs> is there a command to see what pc set up Pat has?
[2:07:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> And you get all these anti-jedi abilities but you hardly ever fight people using force.
[2:07:50] <Goodvibes99508> there are sith with blue lightsabers
[2:08:15] <kortin> it's a shame kotor1 just feels like a straight downgrade after playing 2, for me.
[2:08:24] <%RaziWraith> Imagine if Sith were just "non-Jedi" forces users.
[2:08:36] <$The_AngryHoogs> !commands
[2:08:36] <@Moobot> Use these to snitch on your friends !snitch, !sellout, !countdown, !uptime, !recipe
[2:08:40] <%Movemeister> KOTOR the one staring Jet Li
[2:08:41] <Fabpsi_> best to not pick those lightsabers up. They probably vanished thanks to spacemagic..I mean darth jedi tricks

[2:09:09] <Fabpsi_> doggie is not having it unless treeeeaaaat!
[2:09:23] <%StrawberryPantsu> @PatStaresAt Where did you get your shirt?
[2:09:24] <Too_Much_Nukie> Something I don't like about the red lightsaber thing is Sith are supposed to be individualists. So all of them having the same lightsaber color defeats that.
[2:09:27] <%weissguard> Yeah, my sister's dog likes those
[2:09:32] <%ChrisPlaysThing> My dog loves her greenies
[2:09:34] <%RaziWraith> Zangief does not want to be displayed for content! SwiftRage

[2:18:22] <cherrycottontail> people who say things are 'blue, not purple' are always wrong
[2:18:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> This is why you should always have one of your apprentices lead the team.
[2:18:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Bask in the Dark Evil

[2:21:15] <%RaziWraith> With all these cheeks running around, it's no wonder people go to the "dark side" LUL
[2:21:21] <Too_Much_Nukie> There was no time to create a unique model for this armor.
[2:21:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> Why are the Sith so into wicker furniture?
[2:21:43] <%Broken_Sonex> @RaziWraith The dark side of the moon one might say
[2:21:50] <+RobinFoDays> Every side is the dark side when youre buried in them cheeks
[2:21:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> Basket weaving is an ancient sith technique.

[2:22:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> Fun fact: There's a puzzle in this area that caused me to learn algebra as a child.
[2:22:35] <%rawrmeowxd> @PatStaresAt is it true you're gonna stream Silent Hill 4 after you beat this game?
[2:22:37] <%Broken_Sonex> @RobinFoDays Damn straight
[2:22:43] <%RaziWraith> @Pookiedaexzile LUL
[2:23:20] <%RaziWraith> Wait so there is just "dark side" of the force coming out of a vent? LUL
[2:23:48] <+Demirose41> TT0TT
[2:23:48] <%Broken_Sonex> @Pookiedaexzile Sith power is stored in the dummy thicc ass
[2:23:50] <james_uu> Don't breath the dark side fumes
[2:23:55] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I didn't even play the beta and I'm getting withdrawals
[2:23:56] <%SomersaultJustice> I heard they're trying but no promises
[2:24:01] <%rawrmeowxd> awww DBZ isn't online??? that game is sick
[2:24:03] <+RobinFoDays> Lets just hope for a DBZF 2
[2:24:08] <%valriot> Imagine if a FG was playable
[2:24:11] <+loukemia83> Imagine if "insert fighting game here" had good netcode is the curse of this generation.
[2:24:11] <Zeif00> dbz, gbfv.... FeelsBadMan
[2:24:17] <%QueequegTheater> @rawrmeowxd it is, it's just bad
[2:24:22] <+loukemia83> Tekken 7, DBZF, Soul Calibur, SFV, etc etc
[2:24:24] <%SomersaultJustice> imagine if fighting games were good
[2:24:29] <NitronStreams> Imagine if 90% of the fighting games to come out in the last five years had that netcode
[2:24:31] <%Pookiedaexzile> No, No you don't get the good net code and a Dragonball license
[2:24:32] <%RaziWraith> It's bandai namco isn't it? If DBFZ gets rollback does that mean Smash can? LUL
[2:24:44] <%valriot> Its..alright. Have auto combos personally and super dash is zzzzz
[2:24:53] <%rawrmeowxd> damn. They got good DLC tho @QueequegTheater
[2:24:55] <%valriot> MAKE A FUCKIN JOJO GAME
[2:24:57] <T_Sasquatch> no fuck dbfz
[2:25:00] <tranquilturnip> is DBZF better to pick up on console or pc?
[2:25:04] <+Demirose41> okay they do that BUT its fate
[2:25:05] <+yukichocomilk> eventually they'll all have rollback
[2:25:07] <%SomersaultJustice> DRAGON SQUARE
[2:25:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> Call it Pee-Pee Poo-Poo Time
[2:25:09] <ExpressNode> DBZF Budokai - Rollback edition
[2:25:12] <%baka_sugoi> GIVE US FUC
[2:25:12] <+RobinFoDays> KOF15 will have rollback so hopefully its becoming the standard
[2:25:17] <Meekest> What if they wanna fix the netcode but Toei is like "don't touch DBZFZ"
[2:25:17] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Imagine if any of these games had the same work put into the netcode as that free browser game Woolie streamed
[2:25:24] <%notsoy> we need capcom vs capcom
[2:25:25] <%rawrmeowxd> the old one on PS2 was pretty good imo @valriot
[2:25:25] <+loukemia83> @tranquilturnip On console you can play on Parsec, so online works
[2:25:27] <%valriot> "Capcom"
[2:25:33] <%notsoy> capcom fighting word salad
[2:25:35] <%Pookiedaexzile> Guilty Gear X BLAZE BLUE: JAM session
[2:25:35] <+loukemia83> can't
[2:25:49] <%RaziWraith> Yes, they NEED to start shunning games without rollback. Make it a standard.
[2:25:53] <%valriot> @rawrmeowxd Yeah but i want a new oneeeee
[2:25:55] <+RobinFoDays> What kind of netcode did Infinite have
[2:26:04] <%notsoy> good rollback
[2:26:09] <Fabpsi_> just make a fighting game called "netcode", and let it have bad netcode
[2:26:14] <%notsoy> there's still a community that runs weekly online-only tourneys
[2:26:16] <olaksi> who could defe... *bzzz*
[2:26:19] <Huntercd> Why are they British?
[2:26:24] <%Pookiedaexzile> What is infinite?
[2:26:25] <%tinyswampthing> a fixed version of sf5w rollback
[2:26:26] <james_uu> oh look, two geefs
[2:26:28] <%rawrmeowxd> true true @valriot
[2:26:29] <%JumboCrunchies> We just have to hope enough devs jump on the good net tech to make it the norm.  Take away the excuses.
[2:26:32] <%QueequegTheater> because they're evil
[2:26:38] <Fabpsi_> those monsters are not british, they just look like it Huntercd
[2:27:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Pookiedaexzile I assume Marvel Infinite
[2:27:21] <%rawrmeowxd> It sucks the last Soul Calibur was trash
[2:27:32] <%CalderGaming> @Pookiedaexzile marvel vs capcom infinite
[2:27:38] <tranquilturnip> @PatStaresAt is there still a heavy bias towards console for fighting games?
[2:27:42] <Thalchampz> i would
[2:27:42] <%BTR_NOODLE> I would.
[2:27:44] <+Demirose41> can we play?

[2:28:36] <ChungusQuest> pat, I'll stick around to watch anothing you play as long as you're loud about it
[2:28:37] <%RaziWraith> Seriously considering just shilling out for GGS but I don't normally play fighting games. I don't know.
[2:28:38] <thefl3xicutioner> hes a corpse being puppeted by eddie i thought
[2:28:41] <%vaporousTippler> XX was basically Weekend at Zato-1's.
[2:28:43] <%za7az> Eh, I'm personally not huge into fighting games. More power to everyone who is though
[2:28:46] <%Pookiedaexzile> I will enjoy it if you group stream with woolie, and we get a dual stream like the other night
[2:28:53] <%rawrmeowxd> Guilty Gear stream before or after the Silent Hill 4 stream????
[2:28:58] <%JumboCrunchies> "Robe for Losers +1"

[2:29:46] <%Broken_Sonex> But Pat, I don't watch Woolie's fighting game  streams because I don't like fighting games
[2:29:52] <olaksi> Guess mandalorians don't respect talk is free action
[2:29:57] <%Pookiedaexzile> For anyone who says they suck at fighting games, Play Toughlove Arena its free and in browser
[2:30:06] <%Pookiedaexzile> It will teach you much
[2:30:11] <olaksi> same honestly
[2:30:12] <Huntercd> Are there same sex pairings in this or is it all hetero?
[2:30:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Same

[2:30:13] <%rawrmeowxd> well then you're just wrong @Broken_Sonex

[2:30:46] <Gates623> Weekly virtua fighter
[2:30:58] <Too_Much_Nukie> So you're gonna play Dong Dong Never Die?
[2:31:00] <%JoshManVGH> What if you played 2.5D Character Action levels that had only one enemy spawn?
[2:31:01] <Huntercd> Didn't Woolie get beat by a HoloLive VTuber?
[2:31:05] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt When has your stream ever been good Pat
[2:31:05] <%Pukenasty> the gloves are off now
[2:31:08] <%Broken_Sonex> I would watch it if it was good, yeah
[2:31:14] <%rawrmeowxd> how is his mask moving like that???
[2:31:15] <thefl3xicutioner> @PatStaresAt so at what point do we start talking about the trash ones that are funny to watch
[2:31:22] <+loukemia83> Pat starts doing a weekly Judgement stream, but it's actually just Final Showdown
[2:31:27] <Sol_Install> love how the mask you
[2:31:28] <%Invlux> ECHOES HE SAID IT
[2:31:30] <%Pookiedaexzile> Pat's really heeling up a storm
[2:31:32] <Sol_Install> you know*
[2:31:35] <Sol_Install> moves lol
[2:31:36] <sendart> he looks like a kamen rider villain
[2:31:38] <+Demirose41> guys guys dont worry Pat will figure it out
[2:31:38] <%gitgouda> why does his mask stretch
[2:31:40] <tranquilturnip> why would evil people train evil people for free
[2:31:41] <BoneofMalkav> Yes! Dong Dong Never Die, the ONLY fighting game worth playing
[2:31:48] <+MaitrePielle> hope you brought a fuckin umbrella
[2:31:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> 2HY
[2:32:03] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WHY IS HIS MASK MOVING LUL LUL LUL
[2:32:03] <%rawrmeowxd> yo that's a sick ass pool tho
[2:32:09] <Fabpsi_> His mask is next level. It has lip-movement implemented
[2:32:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> This conversation makes more sense if you're a lightside apprentice of teh protagonist.
[2:32:12] <%Pookiedaexzile> I do, now die
[2:32:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> YUP
[2:32:18] <%Dunmarkh> LUL LUL
[2:32:25] <%valriot> Hes gonna teach you how to Force Jizz like Palpatine
[2:32:26] <tranquilturnip> maybe he's talking to Bao LUL
[2:32:26] <Huntercd> Her ass tho
[2:32:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> Pick 3
[2:32:29] <%gitgouda> shes waaaay more darkside then them
[2:32:34] <goose_coward> you've been basking in evil steam every chance you get
[2:32:45] <%QueequegTheater> USE IT
[2:32:48] <%Daxalog> What happens if you send 3 droids here?
[2:32:50] <+MaitrePielle> use it
[2:32:56] <Fabpsi_> dew it
[2:32:57] <%Alopekis> If they stopped calling "The Dark Side" it probably wouldn't sound so bad.
[2:33:01] <%QueequegTheater> "Invest in short stocks"
[2:33:01] <%vaporousTippler> This is like a Dark Side infomercial.
[2:33:04] <Shining_Armor> Become sith!
[2:33:05] <tranquilturnip> why would he train you like this anyway
[2:33:11] <%Pookiedaexzile> Aight bro....but you aint gonna like it
[2:33:22] <%maenos2> this dude is getting off
[2:33:23] <%CalderGaming> when has "just give in" ever been received as positive advice
[2:33:23] <derekwst3> @PatStaresAt now talk to their managers
[2:33:27] <Huntercd> I'd rather be a Sith of Lust
[2:33:31] <%Broken_Sonex> Her booty begins to swell as the dark side embraces her
[2:33:35] <Fabpsi_> are they going from door to door like a salesman and try to get them into the dark side with that weak story?
[2:33:37] <+MaitrePielle> sith poppins
[2:33:38] <%rawrmeowxd> literally just did the "so you have chosen death" meme
[2:33:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> They explain this better in the first game, but the dark side is not emotions and stuff. That LEADS to the dark side. The dark side is an eldrich sentient entity.
[2:33:45] <kortin> These guys are like comedy villains
[2:33:45] <%RaziWraith> "sith master" not even a named darth LUL

[2:34:35] <%rawrmeowxd> they were having an evil pool party
[2:34:40] <derekwst3> @PatStaresAt did you know that pool represent space
[2:34:41] <+Demirose41> look at it
[2:34:48] <+Demirose41> it has a unique model
[2:34:51] <%QueequegTheater> Off handed

[2:34:57] <+loukemia83> @Too_Much_Nukie Is that entity named Palatine?
[2:34:58] <+Movemeister> no compensating
[2:35:08] <%Mrbaconator> it's not about size it's about how you use it pat
[2:35:09] <%Ipsenscastle> he used to have a long one until he freed a nad with it
[2:35:09] <%Pookiedaexzile> Whats wrong with a short light saber
[2:35:09] <%rawrmeowxd> SIZE DOESN'T MATTER PAT DX
[2:35:10] <Huntercd> Nads haahaha
[2:35:11] <Too_Much_Nukie> @loukemia83 Fuck you
[2:35:12] <Fabpsi_> just have to imagine the architect & builder "yea, so. we want a huge ass bad evil lair for evil stuff. Can you make that happen?" - "how evil?" "OH very very evil!"
[2:35:17] <derekwst3> @PatStaresAt its not the size of the lightsaber, its how you use it
[2:35:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> He was a badass
[2:35:24] <%gitgouda> people were shorter in the past pat, dont judge
[2:35:34] <%JumboCrunchies> It's a lightsaber for Pat.
[2:35:37] <anAngryHamster> It's his offhand cause he rocked the blaster saber combo
[2:35:49] <%QueequegTheater> Pat did you really criticize someone for shortness
[2:35:53] <anAngryHamster> He's sith Naked Snake
[2:35:57] <%SaiyanShoto> My sisters new puppy walked all over my phone and almost sent random letters in chat LUL LUL
[2:35:57] <+MaitrePielle> didn't know mandos just shocked tf out their foes
[2:36:00] <james_uu> fought like a mando? but you won

[2:36:21] <%JumboCrunchies> Pocket Streamer
[2:36:36] <+SilverDevilfish> "Basilisk"
[2:36:40] <goose_coward> haaaht
[2:36:41] <SolomonMcMan> Guys he's engaged, you literally can't hurt him
[2:36:45] <Fabpsi_> a war droid, huh? Time to train that droid some force storm
[2:36:50] <Huntercd> It that a robot?
[2:36:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt Fun fact: This "basilisk war droid" is a reused model from a different Star Wars game. Chris Avellone bragged about the fact that this game got Lucas' approval and thus this is the canon design now because he HATED how Basilisk War Droids looked.
[2:37:05] <Too_Much_Nukie> Chris is kind of a dick sometimes.
[2:37:13] <%rawrmeowxd> buying things off Ebay be like
[2:37:15] <+MaitrePielle> only Paige can hurt him now
[2:37:25] <+SilverDevilfish> It's from Shadows of the Empire
[2:37:32] <Too_Much_Nukie> Basilisk War Droids are like robot dragons, if you google them you'll find some images.
[2:37:33] <%Ipsenscastle> @Too_Much_Nukie he was right, they looked dumb as fuck
[2:37:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYYE
[2:37:37] <waywardhavoc> mandalore comes with you i think
[2:37:39] <%QueequegTheater> No room
[2:37:40] <%Pookiedaexzile> "Like new" Condition
[2:37:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> Because Kreia has to come with.
[2:37:51] <tranquilturnip> take your grandma to work day
[2:37:54] <%Broken_Sonex> The way this thing lands in the city is so fucking flaccid.
[2:37:59] <%notsoy> lame-ass kreia smh
[2:38:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> @Ipsenscastle Fuck you they're rad.
[2:38:08] <+Demirose41> so Swtor is gunna be the next game to stream yea???
[2:38:15] <%rawrmeowxd> if space was real why didn't they film this cutscene real time??
[2:38:16] <Fabpsi_> and grandma just gonna be angry no matter what you do
[2:38:20] <+SilverDevilfish> "Offline weapon systems"
[2:38:23] <%Broken_Sonex> Like look at that. No impact
[2:38:29] <%Dunmarkh> nice brakes holy shit
[2:38:41] <Fabpsi_> perfect landing
[2:38:45] <+Aleate> So they don't have to make new assets- I mean, so you are closer to your destination!
[2:38:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> See they treat it as if a Basilisk War Droid is this huge deal and yet, it's just a tiny ship.
[2:38:54] <Too_Much_Nukie> Like fuck.
[2:39:31] <%Broken_Sonex> And in game it looks like it did more damage than the cut scene shows.
[2:39:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @too_much_nukie Its literally covered in cannons tho
[2:40:05] <%Broken_Sonex> Like the ground did not cave in in the cut scene.
[2:40:15] <james_uu> put it all in ass
[2:40:20] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Small stuff can be scary if its killed millions of people. Just cuz ship aint big doesnt mean its not scary
[2:40:44] <BoneofMalkav> ^
[2:40:48] <Fabpsi_> but the ship ain't using the fancy weapons
[2:40:57] <BoneofMalkav> #GivePatTheZap
[2:40:58] <+Demirose41> The Zappster
[2:41:01] <$dmdyne99> They should have used the OG war Droid design

[2:41:10] <%SvenHolgersson> YOU CAN YOUR ZAPS
[2:41:12] <%SvenHolgersson> I SWEAR

[2:44:35] <kortin> I don't know who Post Malone is, and sometimes I feel like people invent famous people and just all pretend like these people have existed for years.
[2:44:40] <%SvenHolgersson> Paige is marrying a boomer
[2:44:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THIS

[2:49:06] <+Demirose41> <3
[2:49:23] <Fabpsi_> karen, fighting until she sees the ultimate manager
[2:49:56] <%Dunmarkh> Nice gun holy shit
[2:49:59] <+megaman_sentinel> if u c her kill 20 ppl be u why bother
[2:50:12] <Fabpsi_> that gun really does look nice
[2:51:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> Shit like this choice really REALLY makes me mad there isn't a sequel.
[2:51:18] <%Invlux> Doesn't force persuade only work on idiots LUL
[2:51:19] <Huntercd> Is the Queen alive or dead?
[2:51:29] <Too_Much_Nukie> She's deadn't.
[2:51:34] <Fabpsi_> wow... "anything that the queen has on her person"... well how much stuff does a queen have on her?
[2:51:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> But that will be fixed.
[2:51:41] <%Broken_Sonex> @Invlux Yes, so he's an idiot.
[2:51:50] <%psidefx> She's alive adjacent
[2:52:07] <+AH_Steve17> Always good to have meetings out in the open during an arial bombardment
[2:52:23] <Too_Much_Nukie> Weak is a relative term anyway. If you're powerful enough you can use it on stronger wills.
[2:52:24] <Huntercd> Are there any other evil options besides killing the queen?
[2:52:25] <Fabpsi_> i like the casual dead guy in the background
[2:52:30] <Too_Much_Nukie> Or if multiple jedi/sith do it together.
[2:52:48] <+megaman_sentinel> she has 2 insult every employee before she see the manager
[2:53:02] <scrublordsamurai> @fabpsi_ thats the welhiem scream guy
[2:53:07] <CuddlyKaiju> This guy seems super trustworthy....
[2:53:19] <kortin> so is this a dark side questline or restored content or am I dumb? I don't remember ever doing anything like this
[2:53:31] <Too_Much_Nukie> Dark side.
[2:53:35] <Fabpsi_> "well then you will die first, my queen"
[2:53:39] <ChungusQuest> Oh wow, this lady looks exactly like a character from Supreme COmmander
[2:53:40] <jorniev> KAREN
[2:53:43] <%rawrmeowxd> Wurst?
[2:53:48] <Too_Much_Nukie> You only get this version of the palace raid if you did some specific side quests on your first Onderon visit.
[2:53:51] <%DashXero> She's here to speak to your manager.
[2:53:52] <%psidefx> S H O O K E T H
[2:53:56] <$Mekhet09> Why do people treat nobility as the good people?
[2:53:59] <$Mekhet09> Like games.
[2:54:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LORD SHE COMIN
[2:54:11] <%SvenHolgersson> Damn Ka'rhen looking kinda bad tho
[2:54:14] <jorniev> ITS FEELS AS IF THOUSANDS OF KARENS SUDDENLY STARTED SCREAMING
[2:54:15] <Too_Much_Nukie> Fun Fact: Kavar was your master. So of the Jedi Masters he has the most direct connection to the exile, and is the most similar in terms of political views.
[2:54:19] <scrublordsamurai> @mekhet09  cause disney
[2:54:21] <%psidefx> She's here to have council with the board of directors
[2:54:24] <Fabpsi_> nah, Karen is not bad
[2:54:53] <+megaman_sentinel> sir she just came in the front door what are we to do ?
[2:54:56] <@SoFarFetched> D:
[2:54:57] <ZizerX> LUL
[2:54:58] <Too_Much_Nukie> The other jedi masters always talk about how Kavar knew war and was a brilliant strategist, just like the exil.
[2:54:59] <Fabpsi_> holy shit that must be a jedi
[2:54:59] <@SoFarFetched> he move fast
[2:55:06] <+LastHazzerd> i like this dudes volce
[2:55:16] <Fabpsi_> they don't need you, they have freaking teleporting dudes
[2:55:18] <+LastHazzerd> he sounds like an old timey radio news ancho
[2:55:26] <%za7az> No Pat, he was just running really fast KappaHD
[2:56:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> You might want to take a second to examine the skybox here.
[2:56:08] <Too_Much_Nukie> After the fights.
[2:56:10] <jorniev> why would you try to argue strategy with a person who moves in a straight line of dead people
[2:56:21] <%rawrmeowxd> big zap energy
[2:56:24] <Huntercd> Did Kreia get a new hand?
[2:56:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> No.
[2:56:41] <Huntercd> Oh nevermind
[2:56:57] <Fabpsi_> ah, I saw some ships at the sky flying around. That's nice
[2:57:07] <Too_Much_Nukie> 2 Droids and a single dude, and he says "attack them men"
[2:57:19] <%SirGO0SE> I wonder if these soliders helping you out know how unnecessary they are
[2:57:33] <+Pengers> Are you overleveled or something? Those dudes got decimated
[2:57:37] <Too_Much_Nukie> So this skybox is different in the minigame than it is out of the minigame.
[2:57:45] <Too_Much_Nukie> You're in a new zone, technically.
[2:57:46] <ChungusQuest> oh man, that rinky-dink explosion effect LUL
[2:57:46] <%psidefx> "Don't get too cocky kid"
[2:58:11] <Fabpsi_> pew pew pew, take that evil sky!
[2:58:27] <%SomersaultJustice> it's like bayonetta
[2:58:38] <+thatotherblackkid> solid storm trooper aim
[2:58:48] <scrublordsamurai> @patstaresat  killthe skybox pat!
[2:59:08] <Zero_Jacks> ?
[2:59:10] <%rawrmeowxd> it's like the chance is literally 0
[2:59:16] <Too_Much_Nukie> One thing I like about the dark side version of the palace assault is Kavar's reaction. He knows they're completely fucked once he sense you're on the planet.
[2:59:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> It would really suck to be the one guy who survives the initial lightning blast.
[2:59:56] <%chiazam> BZZZZZZT
[3:00:03] <%Ranryu692> if they were important, they would've had longer health bars
[3:00:10] <JDChaosed> This game looks kinda boring, like force storm seems great cause iot just speeds through all  the dull parts.
[3:00:10] <%chiazam> Force Storm is so wrong on so many levels
[3:00:43] <Too_Much_Nukie> I wanna say there used to be a way to fall out of world on the sky ramp too.
[3:00:47] <Fabpsi_> the game is not really boring, it has some great ideas and characters....just....sadly not enough time^^'
[3:01:03] <+megaman_sentinel> is KOTOR 1 worth playing
[3:01:06] <Fabpsi_> but yea, force storm is just blasting everything
[3:01:08] <scrublordsamurai> they have such a good plan, stand out in the open in groups of 6
[3:01:11] <%SirGO0SE> ooo a mine :)
[3:01:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> I'd say so.
[3:01:22] <@SSaryn> @megaman_sentinel Big worth, big play for big bois
[3:01:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @megaman_sentinel u kidding? its one of the greatest games ever made
[3:01:30] <JDChaosed> the story n stuff seems cool tho.
[3:01:41] <Too_Much_Nukie> RUN FOR YOUR LIVES
[3:01:51] <%gksnipa> is this were remade, it would need so many rebalances
[3:01:52] <Dragovus> NO ESCAPE!
[3:01:55] <Too_Much_Nukie> See that conversation is why dark side is fun in the endgame.
[3:01:55] <%chiazam> KILL EM ALL
[3:01:56] <ChungusQuest> "GET THEM!" says commander with no living subordinates.
[3:01:58] <jorniev> doing that vader thing in that movie
[3:02:14] <jorniev> i do
[3:02:17] <%twistingt0rt0ise> If only they didn't stand in unobstructed hallways to get mowed down.
[3:02:18] <%Nekros4442> It'd be pretty rad
[3:02:19] <%chiazam> Oh my god
[3:02:23] <@SSaryn> Being more of a God than the Jedi or the Sith ever were?
[3:02:25] <Fabpsi_> how many of your friends do you need to see dying because of lighting before you just go "nah, I am out of here, bb"
[3:02:26] <jorniev> THAT VADER SCENE
[3:02:27] <Too_Much_Nukie> @gksnipa Eh, you could keep it as is honestly. Keep in mind Pat is playing on normal not the highest difficulty.
[3:02:28] <%adzy2k6> Didn't this happen in the last star wars film?
[3:02:29] <%rawrmeowxd> can't imagine a star wars movie bc space isn't real Pat
[3:02:30] <+megaman_sentinel> think I'll give it a shot thx chat
[3:02:32] <+AH_Steve17> i would be laughing in the theatre but hey at least i would feel something watching a star wars
[3:02:33] <%psidefx> I'd just lay on the ground and pretend to be dead
[3:02:33] <%chiazam> That's be so fuggin sick
[3:02:39] <Too_Much_Nukie> It doesn't have to be a difficult game when it's such a story-driven experience.
[3:02:41] <%DashXero> That guy should have been left alive. He'd make an excellent training dummy for our new students.
[3:02:42] <%za7az> That would make them a very intimidating force
[3:02:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I really wanna see that
[3:02:44] <+Demirose41> like F.E.A.R???
[3:02:46] <%dekkitout> Yeah- clone wars
[3:02:48] <jorniev> THAT WOULD BE AWESOME
[3:02:50] <Too_Much_Nukie> There IS a comic where Vader does that.
[3:02:50] <scrublordsamurai> it should have been episode 3 but then it sucked
[3:02:51] <+Demirose41> but instead of a little girl its Vader
[3:02:52] <%Ranryu692> you gotta go to the comics to get the cool Star Wars shit
[3:02:56] <Too_Much_Nukie> But he's just pushing people.
[3:02:59] <ChungusQuest> I need to watch Scannercop again
[3:03:04] <%chiazam> YEAH LIKE IN CLONE WARS
[3:03:08] <tranquilturnip> That happens once in the promotional cinematics for Force Unleashed
[3:03:13] <jorniev> LIKE R RATED THOR RAKNAROK

[3:04:48] <%SirGO0SE> because it works like that in the first one too lol
[3:04:58] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah Vaklu's plan only succeeds because of you.
[3:05:05] <Fabpsi_> look at that spinning gun
[3:05:09] <Too_Much_Nukie> It's less a plan and more "What if we fought everyone?"
[3:05:10] <%Daxalog> Look at his gun. it spins
[3:05:10] <Dragovus> Betray the General before he can betray you
[3:05:11] <%Alopekis> The dude needs to learn where to point his weapon.
[3:05:21] <jorniev> you look like chode dude
[3:05:22] <Too_Much_Nukie> This segment is entirely different light side.
[3:05:29] <%Ranryu692> yeah, this planet is pretty forgettable
[3:05:34] <Fabpsi_> 10/10 trigger discipline
[3:05:39] <%Ipsenscastle> sounds like matt berry?
[3:05:39] <shielded_minitilt> look at that warcraft armor
[3:05:40] <Too_Much_Nukie> And to get this version you have to do that assassination sidequest you did on your first visit.
[3:05:46] <jorniev> red and yellow armor makes him look like such an asshole
[3:05:53] <%rawrmeowxd> Is this supposed to be the end planet??
[3:06:01] <Too_Much_Nukie> No
[3:06:10] <Fabpsi_> there is more^^
[3:06:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> But it's the start of the game's linear ending.
[3:06:35] <Too_Much_Nukie> This is the final jedi master you talk to/fight before the enclave.

[3:06:45] <ChungusQuest> Zip-zap-zoop and he's effin' dead!
[3:06:48] <jorniev> or also trying to kill him?
[3:06:53] <Link232> ...What is that line delivery
[3:06:57] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt It's the jungle moon.
[3:07:02] <scrublordsamurai> this voice acting lol
[3:07:06] <Too_Much_Nukie> You killed the guys on the moon that were controlling the beasts.
[3:07:08] <@SoFarFetched> suddenly everything is about the moon
[3:07:08] <%SvenHolgersson> MOONS HAUNTED
[3:07:13] <p0tat0ch1p5> It's cause mankind knew they cannot change society
[3:07:15] <%Dunmarkh> MANKIND COULD NOT CHANGE SOCIETY
[3:07:15] <%za7az> Maybe the beasts are scared of you?
[3:07:17] <%SvenHolgersson> BLOODBORNE TIME
[3:07:20] <Too_Much_Nukie> They establish it but not clearly. It's one cutscene.
[3:07:22] <Fabpsi_> get the pistols, moons haunted

[3:13:43] <+lemjor10> Pat the Post Malone concert is already over after 12 minutes. He sang about fucking sex dolls and they didn’t censor it.
[3:13:45] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt imagine running around aoe mines instead of eating them this post made by WAR gang
[3:13:49] <%shurtal> Time elapsed: 9:15/Average Wait time: 7m
[3:13:56] <%Broken_Sonex> @scrublordsamurai I do, too. But don't watch his stuff live. "VOD watchers skip." etc.
[3:14:15] <Fabpsi_> evilll? Look at the lighting. Blue. What else is blue? The Lightsaber of a good jedi. There you go, Karen is good
[3:14:17] <shurtal> Warriors rise  UP

[3:16:23] <%rawrmeowxd> Did anyone ever figure out if that was really Jeffrey Combs in Outriders?
[3:16:43] <%gitgouda> which armor is set is that?
[3:16:43] <Fabpsi_> yes, droids will help!
[3:16:52] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt it's because force storm is literally bugged to be stronger than it should be
[3:16:58] <GustauveVIII> @patstaresat technically the game stops scaling enemies at around level 25
[3:17:13] <Gruhunchously> Malak was lame
[3:17:23] <Fabpsi_> "everyone attack" what?
[3:17:25] <Fabpsi_> dude, you are alone
[3:17:38] <DNOpls> that was a close one he almost got you
[3:17:40] <%Invlux> "As long as I'm alive" isn't long at all
[3:18:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @fabpsi_ He talking to the voices in his hesd
[3:18:12] <Gruhunchously> You have to admire his dedication to his duty
[3:18:20] <Fabpsi_> ah, good to know other people have those too^^
[3:18:29] <olaksi> Why do people keep saying "as long as I'm alive" to superpowered monsters?
[3:18:40] <%QueequegTheater> @Gruhunchously no more than any other soldier Karen murdered
[3:18:47] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> 666 viewers?!
[3:18:50] <Gruhunchously> Though I guess there no real choice between 'Death by Karen' and 'shot for treason' '

[3:20:05] <jorniev> USE DRUGS?
[3:20:07] <Too_Much_Nukie> Drexl are MASSIVE beasts. Basically Godzilla.
[3:20:10] <%Broken_Sonex> More like a buff GILF
[3:20:11] <%QueequegTheater> kreia mommy milkers
[3:20:12] <Gruhunchously> I fully grown one of these thing is the reason they have those laser cannons on the walls
[3:20:13] <olaksi> it's been 3 turns and the enemy is not dead, I don't understand
[3:20:16] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> I know this combat style has aged but I still like it.
[3:20:18] <Fabpsi_> #spacemagic
[3:20:26] <Too_Much_Nukie> Yeah Drexl are kaiju.
[3:20:40] <Dave_VD> Kreia looks good with a yellow saber. I think I gave her green

[3:21:18] <%ZizerX> that was cool
[3:21:29] <Gruhunchously> Poor Bastilla. Battle Meditation was her one special thing and now everyone can do it.
[3:21:29] <Fabpsi_> wow, those moves. All synch' up. Imagine someone meditates near you and you can suddenly do frontflips for style
[3:21:58] <%Broken_Sonex> Man Bastilla was treated soooo special because of her battle meditation.
[3:22:01] <ChungusQuest> WHAT?  I can't hear you over these lightsabers!!
[3:22:07] <%QueequegTheater> MONEY
[3:22:18] <%rawrmeowxd> ask for his manager
[3:22:18] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Pockets is Back
[3:22:21] <Gruhunchously> One thing I really like is that if you're darkside, the Jedi Master assume that YOU are the one who destroyed Katarr instead of Nihilus.
[3:22:24] <Captain_Joe1911> tansy5Tuntun SirSword
[3:22:24] <Fabpsi_> "how de we handle this" *lightsaber sound increases *

[3:23:00] <%PocketBearIllustrator> so you the baddie now?
[3:23:09] <Fabpsi_> *happy lightsaber noises *
[3:23:12] <pilllowofbees> Why you evil? Because im petty as fuck LUL
[3:23:12] <Too_Much_Nukie> See this is why you really really shouldn't do dark side on your first playthrough.
[3:23:14] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> BZZZZZZZZZZ
[3:23:17] <%chiazam> Isn't this the one that's not an asshole?
[3:23:17] <%Broken_Sonex> @Gruhunchously Now she's just a jedi that sounds like Jen Hale.
[3:23:19] <Too_Much_Nukie> People just refuse to speak to you.
[3:23:42] <Too_Much_Nukie> @chiazam He's also your former master so he's the most emotional upon seeing you as a sith.
[3:23:43] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> @sofarfetched I wish I had a vibrating famer chair BibleThump
[3:23:50] <%ItsCaptainDisco> This Jedi is very helpful for someone who says he won't help you
[3:23:51] <@SoFarFetched> oh man if I had a famer chair
[3:23:55] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> gamer*
[3:23:56] <Too_Much_Nukie> He believed in you when the others didn't. And you proved him wrong.
[3:23:58] <Gruhunchously> You guys were mean to me during my formative years, so now you all get to die.
[3:23:59] <@SoFarFetched> just sit on it to gain fame
[3:24:05] <$Mekhet09> Well he's actually putting up a fight.
[3:24:13] <Fabpsi_> while it is vibrating
[3:24:15] <%rawrmeowxd> just like the movies
[3:24:18] <Fabpsi_> this sounds wrong
[3:24:19] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> famerchair sounds pretty cool
[3:24:20] <@SoFarFetched> @poohtrailsnailcooch look it was picking up good vibrations,it was not giving me excitations.
[3:24:39] <Gruhunchously> That look of betrayal
[3:24:41] <%ItsCaptainDisco> What benefit is there to going full light side in this game in terms of powers?
[3:24:43] <Gruhunchously> He's like a puppy
[3:24:44] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> @sofarfetched that's too bad :/
[3:24:45] <Fabpsi_> 'klink klink klINK KLINK*

[3:25:54] <+LastHazzerd> "what? i can't hear you!"
[3:25:59] <@SoFarFetched> these clangs need to be louder and then it can be GUTs sword from the bad CG anime.
[3:25:59] <jorniev> dreams are being cancelled and nobody gives a fuck!
[3:26:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @broken_sonex LUL LUL LUL

[3:26:09] <%wembleyttv> "HEY YOU TWO IN THE BACK YOU CAN STOP"

[3:26:32] <%DashXero> Is that the queen fighting for her life back there?
[3:26:42] <Too_Much_Nukie> The best part of this story is that they tried to un-exile you.
[3:26:43] <%DashXero> She's doing pretty well.
[3:26:44] <Fabpsi_> yea
[3:26:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> This is borderline experimental
[3:26:51] <Fabpsi_> and the other guy is screaming like a girl
[3:26:52] <Too_Much_Nukie> They wanted to bring you back into the order and just couldn't find you at all.
[3:27:05] <%rawrmeowxd> sounds just like skrillex
[3:27:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Is that sex?
[3:27:08] <Gruhunchously> This is some David Lynch shit right here
[3:27:09] <Fabpsi_> it really is
[3:27:14] <Too_Much_Nukie> 14 months Pat!
[3:27:19] <+OG_M_Bison> No. They wanted you to come back to the order so they could kill you.
[3:27:27] <%gksnipa> this is like the dmc 3 cutscene with lady and dante
[3:27:27] <+Struggleful> Gunner Type beat
[3:27:29] <@SoFarFetched> The people in the back are dazed from all the combat in the back they're watching.

[3:28:51] <Too_Much_Nukie> @PatStaresAt To be fair, he's much much more reasonable if you don't come to him as a fucking Sith.
