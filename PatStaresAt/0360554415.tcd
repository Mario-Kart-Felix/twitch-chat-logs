[0:04:57] <mercado94> Overwatch anounces: You the p
[0:04:59] <%CerberusDriver> I can't wait for Blizzards next big fuck up so we can find out whose gay next.
[0:04:59] <+Kravedarknesss> @sogeki_dan they don't wanna announce a date cause they don't know if something will screw it up
[0:05:02] <+kurt_0> i am so confused
[0:05:10] <Mrrccava> nothing better to go with playing warframe then listening to pat struggling in Fallout😂
[0:05:10] <%megamonmon123> you guys should watch young justice
[0:05:13] <%mugwugsampoo> Blizzard pulled a Kevin Spacey
[0:05:13] <$Slimshazbot> @AngriestPat Any chance you try Inquisition again assuming it can be fixed? Failing that maybe origins?

[0:05:46] <%SergeEXE> Moobot merely enforces Justice
[0:05:49] <valachi> It's not homophobic to feel like Blizzard only made 76 gay so they could reduce the amount of bad PR they've been getting right?
[0:05:57] <Nordguy> oh, hello today!
[0:06:02] <%megamonmon123> @frostmass22 if you are in us/ canada yes
[0:06:03] <%LogothX> valachi pretty much

[0:06:06] <kumokalt> Stan queer soldier 76, but blizzard wants money for sure
[0:06:08] <$Yakobro> fuck you pat I'm going to bed early for 4.5 naroRage
[0:06:09] <%SergeEXE> @valachi that's the general consensus I feel

[0:06:15] <MarylandJutsu> GAY SOLIDER 76
[0:06:16] <%wohdin> literally everyone already knew 76 was gay tho idk why this is surprising to anyone
[0:06:19] <Cranky_Construct> Eeeey chat.
[0:06:20] <%megamonmon123> oh blizzard pulled an iceman?
[0:06:21] <%LogothX> riot did the same thing
[0:06:28] <%OwlLightningMage> I bet stream is muted LUL
[0:06:30] <dekkitout> gay or not, s76 tells the BEST dad jokes
[0:06:33] <%mistymntns> What's up people?!
[0:06:33] <MarylandJutsu> @wohdin well its being confirmed by the devs so
[0:06:36] <%hamborhger> the scandal with that overwatch pro with the fake identity?
[0:06:37] <oklahomakid92> Your right bro. Bigger and better things
[0:06:37] <mayorrev> What in the goddamn...?
[0:06:42] <MarylandJutsu> Soldier 76 is best GRUMP DAD
[0:06:42] <krazedkarl> @megamonmon123 this will never not fill me with fury
[0:06:44] <$cerass> @marylandjutsu GAEEEEEY
[0:06:44] <%megamonmon123> i dont have a problem with 76 being gay but it seems like cheap brownie points to just say he is gay
[0:06:45] <%Bt_Robot> Dag nab it Pat, Some of us are trying to keep up with the AGDQ stream, and this is not helping...
[0:06:45] <ArtThouBored> I dont lik 76 gay either, I wanted Junkrat
[0:06:47] <%FrostMass22> @valachi No, I think it's more bigoted to pander like they did. It's like they think it's enough for people to forgive their bs.
[0:06:50] <%Prism_Wing> @owllightningmage We were the muted ones all along.
[0:06:51] <mercado94> @hamborhger what?
[0:07:00] <%CerberusDriver> As someone who isn't straight, I'm tired of being a company's pawn every time they fuck up.
[0:07:00] <valachi> Alright that's good. Like I'm not a good person and I have some shitty opinions but I just felt like this was just really lame and felt like it only happened because of stuff like Diablo Immortal and the pro team scandal.
[0:07:02] <MarylandJutsu> HERE WE GO BOIS
[0:07:03] <%mugwugsampoo> Does it really matter though? OMEGALULVERWATCH is dead

[0:31:58] <synthcutter> GAUSS RIFLE

[0:49:18] <ScreamingMeat> Lucky Pat
[0:49:18] <%mostundesired> You don't need charisma if you have the luck of the gods.
[0:49:18] <%DrLinezax777> Pat is gonna win apatBig at casino
[0:49:18] <%TombstoneTTromboners> smdh
[0:49:19] <redsynod> The dumpest stat
[0:49:19] <jerkhov_> Lucky-ish Ted
[0:49:20] <baronvonphazon> Misanthrope
[0:49:20] <%OwlLightningMage> Charisma is only good in the first two games
[0:49:22] <%hamborhger> "luck is powerful in vegas" wtf how could this be
[0:49:22] <%TheFilth> always play your RPG's like a numbers game, never role play
[0:49:24] <%lewdskeletor13> Pat has no charisma
[0:49:25] <Mrzero58 > HE'S SO LUCKY

[0:49:28] <krewl123> i guess this isn't really pat
[0:49:28] <TranquilTurnip> The designers of this game confirmed Charisma is THE dump stat in this game

[0:49:41] <WidestCarnival> !uptime
[0:49:41] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 49m 43s.
[0:49:47] <startadevy> KAPOW

[0:50:02] <$Tuskor13> LUL
[0:50:05] <Desertfishing> wrong about strength, agility increases gun damage
[0:50:05] <The_Sorrow_> 3
[0:50:07] <Gruhunchously> Pat needs tiddies
[0:50:09] <%cureneckbeard> Put luck to fifty
[0:50:15] <%OwlLightningMage> Charisma will be way better in Outer Worlds
[0:50:16] <+DespondentSloth> 5% increments
[0:50:17] <%mostundesired> I like the Dragon Age Origins route, where instead of being a stat, charisma (coercion) is a skill.
[0:50:19] <Mr_Strut> But CHR checks
[0:50:20] <+DespondentSloth> absolutely horrible
[0:50:21] <dukenux> as many as possible
[0:50:21] <%kiyingu_seesar> pat already has his rocket nips
[0:50:22] <C_S_N_G> Pat can get 8 implants, that's a lot of tiddies
[0:50:22] <%TheSpiritof2277> Charisma is only good for companions, but even then :/
[0:50:27] <SubjectX07x> It also makes you able to talk your way out of... most important situations.
[0:50:30] <tacostarvedbeast> ahhh thats why my companions were always so strong in this game
[0:50:40] <SubjectX07x> Makes sense.
[0:50:41] <%mostundesired> IT'S JUST LIKE YOU
[0:50:42] <%Imperial_Madman> its pat
[0:50:43] <%thatother1dude> It's 5% damage, but also 5% DT.
[0:50:44] <%OwlLightningMage> Companions are strong regardless
[0:50:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yes
[0:50:45] <Mr_Strut> Hey guurrrrrl

[0:50:49] <baronvonphazon> The Misanthrope with the heart of gold
[0:50:49] <y_eg> everybody hates you but you're always right
[0:50:49] <+chaumiester> So a bald guy who roofies people... got it
[0:50:51] <$PaleBloodInk> Well-spoken, but you stutter like Agnus from DMC4.
[0:50:52] <dekkitout> youre basically peter parker
[0:50:53] <Aydarkzero> makes sense to me!
[0:50:53] <ScreamingMeat> So he's Bakugou?
[0:50:54] <TheAmazingClaytor> This really is a Pat build

[1:01:48] <%pimpinahz> I wonder if it's the stealth or the goul ass that drove em nuts
[1:01:52] <hazardkujacker> @arcaderabbit48 wait that's Sam Reigel?No wonder Liam O Brein is in this game
[1:01:56] <hassanico> @hamborhger Oh whoops. Yeah I was wrong, it came out during my last 2 years of school
[1:01:56] <%Shady_Zaku> Small room, wooden staircase, north west side of the building
[1:01:57] <%kamen_advent> My favorite party member is a Nightkin
[1:01:58] <%emillionghost> apatDab
[1:01:58] <+Diabetic> Pat stares at and Pat walks through Fallout New Vegas
[1:02:00] <tacostarvedbeast> LOUD NOISES
[1:02:03] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Shillk it is a mod
[1:02:05] <valachi> @Shillk Yeah you get one human and non-human in New Vegas
[1:02:07] <An_Armed_Bear> How about that Alien mobile game huh?
[1:02:07] <+Sochin_Iitsu> HONK at him, Paige
[1:02:10] <%lewdskeletor13> Someday a Fallout game will let us play as a Ghoul
[1:02:11] <Izuurus> Foone?
[1:02:13] <dekkitout> 1 companion per 3 charisma points, though that might have been a mod
[1:02:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> EDE
[1:02:17] <JumboMan214> I wish I was subbed to Pat so I could make him dab against jermaNosewipe
[1:02:17] <dekkitout> *per 2
[1:02:17] <%TheFilth> EDE's on cleanup
[1:02:21] <%Fluxraw> u can have one non-humanoid companion + one humanoid @Shillk
[1:02:22] <lich995> WHOS TALKING
[1:02:22] <Hyphixsys> he's upstairs LUL
[1:02:22] <arcaderabbit48> @Shillk ED-E and the robot dog count as sidekicks and occupy a different slot form your main humanoid companions.
[1:02:24] <Gruhunchously> Children, behave
[1:02:24] <Desertfishing> up stairs
[1:02:24] <%LtThunderbolt> EDE goes sickomode
[1:02:25] <raminnoodle420> Ed-E's just having a murder spree
[1:02:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> THIRSTS FOR BLOOD
[1:02:26] <%king_wragles> ED-E is in the next room, being passive n stuff
[1:02:28] <randomp141> @AngriestPat You are the worst sneaky ninja.
[1:02:28] <%hamborhger> ED-E is taking care of business lmao
[1:02:30] <%pimpinahz> @lewdskeletor13 lol it's called mods
[1:02:30] <alcors_wisdom> together theyre ed-E boone
[1:02:32] <kingdudeby> you can play a ghoul in the fallout classic. Fallout Brotherhood of Steel
[1:02:32] <2DSuperiority> Whole building will be clear in a bit
[1:02:33] <fallacy8> yay Pat!
[1:02:33] <+Shillk> oh wow i never knew this, thanks everyone
[1:02:36] <shaneok64> WHO SAID THAT
[1:02:36] <%OwlLightningMage> Ede putting in work
[1:02:36] <+Templar15> ED-E is having a great time.
[1:02:38] <%TheMattman1313> EASY MODE IS NOW pLAYABLE
[1:02:41] <dukenux> you could play as ghoul in Tactics
[1:02:43] <%emillionghost> @jumboman214 LUL
[1:02:46] <hassanico> There's some funny terminals in this building
[1:02:47] <theruder9> Actually wait, yeah Why DOESN"T 76 let you play as a ghoul or mutant? There's no story it literally does not affect the game at all
[1:02:51] <%kamen_advent> Nuka Cola are free caps!
[1:02:55] <alexandrecau> ED-E complete the quest while Pat is crouching
[1:02:55] <%crimsonharvest> could go for a jack and nuke
[1:02:57] <%hamborhger> @alcors_wisdom lol
[1:03:01] <tacostarvedbeast> yea boone could prob clear out this place alone
[1:03:02] <%megakruemel> I can't see the HP bar but i'm going to assume pat is not dying right now
[1:03:05] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @theruder9 because bethesda is against fun
[1:03:06] <%OwlLightningMage> Shrink ray hype for Outer Worlds. All my enemies will be Pat sized LUL
[1:03:07] <grimnier> I typically leave companions outside, run inside and lay mines as I go, then trick things into blowing themselves up. Don't have to deal with companions running around
[1:03:09] <%Shady_Zaku> Huh...cool
[1:03:10] <alcors_wisdom> @hamborhger gald someone got that
[1:03:14] <arcaderabbit48> @Shillk Combining ED-E and Boone together is particularly absurd. 10 Perception range, plus enemies glow when you look at them through your sights, means you can snipe people form halfway across the Mojave
[1:03:14] <%CerberusDriver> @theruder9 no thatd be fun and interesting
[1:03:15] <thelonechris> The fuck?
[1:03:17] <+AtlasMcCoy> ???
[1:03:17] <%unclekulikov> They're opening your front door....
[1:03:18] <$nademonkey1100> you know what im not a fan of nuka dark rum goddessAngry
[1:03:18] <Hyphixsys> LUL
[1:03:19] <%pimpinahz> PAT!! YELL at those ghouls "TA YEULE"
[1:03:19] <%PenmanLupine> its impossible to stealth in here with companions. they just aggro towards everything
[1:03:19] <JumboMan214> I swear PatDab vs JErma jermaNosewipe would be sick
[1:03:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ???
[1:03:22] <%kiyingu_seesar> WHO'S FIGHTING
[1:03:22] <%Shady_Zaku> are brotherhood and tactics worth playing any?
[1:03:23] <leroypi> They are literally paying you to drink cola
[1:03:23] <Gorgen> Gee Pat. How come your mom lets you have TWO companions?!
[1:03:24] <+aivalera> @theruder9 Because Bethesda is made up of a bunch of bigots.
[1:03:27] <+DoubleKayga> Don't worry about it Pat they have it handled
[1:03:27] <%lewdskeletor13> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[1:03:28] <DonatelloJose> I love the buggy AI so much
[1:03:28] <hassanico> PER is way too high
[1:03:28] <Hyphixsys> your companion of mysteries LUL
[1:03:29] <Lukas_Ipsum> is this the awesome games done quick stream?
[1:03:29] <alcors_wisdom> he cant loot if he cant find the corpses
[1:03:29] <%hamborhger> @alcors_wisdom ED-E on that TOASTY shit haha
[1:03:30] <%VRNK> WHY are you running
[1:03:33] <+Diabetic> This is like when Pat played Modern Warfare for the first time.
[1:03:34] <ScreamingMeat> There is a Hunting Revolver in this area
[1:03:35] <alexandrecau> "Wehre we going"
[1:03:37] <benjiFG> WHO SAID THAT
[1:03:41] <%TheSpiritof2277> Gamebryo is a master-work engine LUL
[1:03:43] <%ItsRatman> Yippidy-dee
[1:03:43] <%megakruemel> instead of nuka dark rum get yourself regular rum
[1:03:45] <%kiiiirsten> Oh I thought I was subscribed for months oops
[1:03:49] <alcors_wisdom> @hamborhger ha i was thinking the same thing
[1:03:53] <lotharrio> Pat is just like Kira... "Oh, I must be having a shootout across the map right now."
[1:03:54] <%lewdskeletor13> MY NAMES SNAKE
[1:03:55] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Hey kids and kidettes
[1:03:55] <Gruhunchously> It's believe it if you said Pat got lost in Modern Warfare.
[1:03:55] <dukenux> Shrink Ray in TOW reminds me of good ol duke nukem, and stomping enemies
[1:03:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yaaaaay

[1:04:24] <Gruhunchously> Oh yeah, this place is ridiculously easy to get lost in.
[1:04:25] <%homelesstwinky> top of the hanging rockets there are tiny lootable trashcans
[1:04:26] <thelonechris> Enjoy your diabetes
[1:04:26] <%hamborhger> but seriously they have good value per weight
[1:04:27] <%Shady_Zaku> gimmie the drugs or I'll go BANG
[1:04:29] <acesahn> Nobody cares about health
[1:04:30] <+AtlasMcCoy> I mean 50hp is pretty ok
[1:04:31] <dukenux> Moobot gettong cranky
[1:04:31] <CuttleCrow> that's....wrong pat
[1:04:32] <Izuurus> get dehydrated
[1:04:32] <+HelloImTom08> only huh?
[1:04:33] <TheAmazingClaytor> Oh geez he's gotta piss
[1:04:34] <%ItsRatman> ...I use them as health items...
[1:04:36] <theruder9> Not even playing on survival Pat is a fake gamer girl
[1:04:38] <sileo_patronus> It's a really good health item though
[1:04:39] <%pimpinahz> @angriestpat Yell at those Ghouls "Ta yeule le cave"
[1:04:39] <%lewdskeletor13> Sunset > Nuka Cola
[1:04:40] <PSI_Guy95> Pat wants those GOLDEN TICKETS so he can go to Wlly Wonka's nuke factory
[1:04:42] <alcors_wisdom> lies
[1:04:42] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> They're actually great heals
[1:04:42] <ToneBacas> they're gonna kick into a musical if this yippidy dee keeps going
[1:04:43] <%DONGWAVE> MEDKIT ON TOiLET WALL
[1:04:44] <%korth367> hows does soda give you health
[1:04:46] <+BerylGem> I sure as hell don't care about items. :D
[1:04:47] <%TheFilth> Pat being objectively wrong yet again
[1:04:50] <%ahegotrigger> nah I love drinking a hundred of them to become temp invncible in a fight
[1:04:50] <BigNerdSam> Just imagine Pat drinking 12 root beers at once
[1:04:52] <+DoubleKayga> you can also just find the caps in most locations
[1:04:56] <%AncelDeLambert> oh my god the LIES
[1:04:57] <%OwlLightningMage> No lockpicking mini games in Outer Worlds
[1:04:58] <%TheSpiritof2277> I'm gonna assume his health-ticker only has like 3 notches on it
[1:04:59] <disflipmat> Alpha Protocol lockpicking
[1:04:59] <%Shady_Zaku> Rippidy dee
[1:05:01] <randomp141> @AngriestPat You do realize your character will get kidney damage by Sunset Sass that, right?
[1:05:02] <Gruhunchously> This is what happens when developers who trained up making isometric maps try to go 3D first person.
[1:05:02] <sileo_patronus> I prefer Oblivion's honestly
[1:05:04] <%king_wragles> I just realized near maxed luck actually breaks the lock picking
[1:05:06] <%CerberusDriver> when you stream oblivion
[1:05:06] <%Solidus_113> @AngriestPat Why would you waste health items like that? You might need them later!
[1:05:08] <theruder9> Fallout has the absolute worst hacking minigame ever.
[1:05:08] <hassanico> Festus is bestus
[1:05:12] <%hamborhger> I found the oblivion one kind of painful but I liked the representation or pins like a real lock
[1:05:14] <TheAmazingClaytor> Lol they stole that lock pick thing from Thief Simulator what losers
[1:05:15] <dukenux> Thief 3 lockpicking was aight
[1:05:16] <+fantom_flasch> Oblivions is probably the closest to actual lockpicking
[1:05:18] <%lewdskeletor13> IM FROM A RIVAL GANG apatWhat apatWhat
[1:05:18] <alexandrecau> dead to right lockpick is the b est
[1:05:21] <%Suplex9000> Has anyone here ever run Oldblivion?
[1:05:21] <Cortana0452> I honestly still have no idea how to do oblivion's lockpicking
[1:05:21] <Etherealizer> Oblivion lockpicking does a good job of translating "feel" through its design
[1:05:23] <viridianowl> Better than the Hacking one IMO
[1:05:23] <%AncelDeLambert> what are you talking about, the hacking's great
[1:05:23] <%kiyingu_seesar> look at that picky boi
[1:05:31] <alexandrecau> there is hot zone everywhere
[1:05:31] <alcors_wisdom> @theruder9 fuck you i love the fallout hacking game
[1:05:32] <%Suplex9000> To make Oblivion run on a shitty computer
[1:05:32] <+BishopBain> Am I wrong for hating hacking in the fallout games? I just don't find it enjoyable at all.
[1:05:34] <%TheFilth> noice
[1:05:36] <%Shady_Zaku> Gimmie the drugs or I'll go B A N G
[1:05:37] <%PenmanLupine> Hunting Revolver is pretty good
[1:05:38] <thelonechris> Oooo~
[1:05:39] <BigNerdSam> CASM is saving...
[1:05:40] <hassanico> Hunting Revolver with a scope
[1:05:40] <frankcastle308> Pew pew
[1:05:41] <%AncelDeLambert> searching for the exclusion code pieces is fine
[1:05:42] <%TheSpiritof2277> Oblivion lockpicking is actually really satisfying
[1:05:42] <%ahegotrigger> NICE
[1:05:43] <%hamborhger> 45-70 is best caliber
[1:05:44] <Gruhunchously> This place is a good mine for Stealth Boys though. There's enough here to last you the rest of the game.
[1:05:46] <%Imperial_Madman> Big Iron acquired
[1:05:46] <alcors_wisdom> now thats a BIG IRON
[1:05:50] <Coystick> Press X to die irl
[1:05:53] <TheAmazingClaytor> Stealthy boi
[1:05:54] <+dujam> deus ex has the best hacking imo
[1:05:58] <dukenux> isnt oblivio. lockpicking basicly the same as in 3/nv?
[1:06:00] <%Suplex9000> Where's the Texas Red meme image
[1:06:03] <Izuurus> if you pick the hand loading perk
[1:06:05] <OkamiDude15> @alexandrecau furry woolie denies you entrance to his hot zone
[1:06:05] <TalisKanju> BIG IRON on your hip
[1:06:07] <%pimpinahz> Les calice de ghoul. Suce sur une grenade mes tabarnak de cave!!!
[1:06:10] <%kiyingu_seesar> ghouly bois
[1:06:16] <alexandrecau> That'S why you should let boone helloing pat
[1:06:16] <arcaderabbit48> @BishopBain Nah, its not great. Its easy to exploit, and its just dull and frustrating to actually do. They could have done hacking much better.
[1:06:17] <dukenux> deus ex hacking was fun... to a degree
[1:06:17] <%pimpinahz> LUL
[1:06:17] <hassanico> How come we haven't seen a single nightkin yet?
[1:06:20] <RipSlamsteak> it's the same as skyrim but oblivion is different
[1:06:20] <Desertfishing> lot of radiation does that
[1:06:27] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @dukenux no it actually has tumblers you have to lock into
[1:06:28] <hassanico> RADical

[1:06:35] <%OwlLightningMage> Deus Ex had the only hacking game I liked.
[1:06:35] <ToneBacas> --- for my Johnny~
[1:06:36] <dukenux> still probly miles above most hackimg minigames
[1:06:36] <%Suplex9000> @AngriestPat It's the same as Dark Souls, World of Warcraft undeads
[1:06:38] <%Shady_Zaku> FUKKEN RAD

[1:06:49] <%megakruemel> thats rad
[1:06:49] <%hamborhger> @Suplex9000 ***
[1:06:50] <theruder9> @alcors_wisdom The hacking is bad. It is completely inconsequential, you guess a few, and if you have 1 guess left, you exit out and reset. There is no risk of failure, just wasting your time forever. There is no reason for a minigame to exist
[1:06:51] <%OwlLightningMage> You will meet some of them in this game
[1:06:51] <nivlac_555> RAD-ical
[1:06:53] <dukenux> as i said
[1:06:54] <sileo_patronus> The thing I don't like about hacking/lockpicking is when they make BOTH have a minimum stat requirement AND do a minigame. Pick one
[1:06:56] <alcors_wisdom> confirmed from before the war thanks f4
[1:06:59] <benjiFG> so they're hollows
[1:06:59] <InsomniacPersona> Thats wrong

[1:07:00] <%pimpinahz> x-RADical
[1:07:03] <+DoubleKayga> is it old age or just more radiation

[1:07:26] <Silly_Duckling> old age can do it, but some times too much rads just makes them go nutso
[1:07:27] <fallacy8> Yeah I remember when my grandma went berserk after getting the Alzheimers
[1:07:28] <Gruhunchously> They never rally go into what causes the Ghoul dementia.

[1:07:44] <lotharrio> They were piss yellow in FO3
[1:07:45] <Gruhunchously> The Master
[1:07:45] <+cerberuscarmine> they change up the ghoul lore every game so theres no solid answer anymore
[1:07:45] <%OwlLightningMage> They were all over all the games LUL
[1:07:46] <%ahegotrigger> true Pat is lord of the wasteland
[1:07:46] <%PenmanLupine> Nightkin aren't on the east coast. they're only in the West Coast
[1:07:46] <%NeonTurnip> not the blue ones tho @AngriestPat
[1:07:47] <%kamen_advent> Nightkin are different because they use Stealthboys that make them blue overtime
[1:07:48] <%lewdskeletor13> No they weren’t Pat
[1:07:48] <dukenux> Theyre rad-orcs Kappa
[1:07:49] <+d00msdaydan> forced evolutionary virus virus?
[1:07:49] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> In FO4, they kinda make it so that you either go feral or you're one of the lucky ones that never do. In older Fallouts they strongly implied it was more like a wasting disease.
[1:07:51] <hassanico> Why are Super Mutants so prone to exploding into chunks?
[1:07:53] <Jimevera> FEV Virus - Forced Evolutionary Virus Virus
[1:07:53] <Coystick> DA MASTA
[1:07:54] <kingdudeby> diffrent super mutants in 3
[1:07:56] <%ahegotrigger> yes

[1:08:01] <%patriotrenegade> @angriestpat Legion or NCR
[1:08:03] <InsomniacPersona> ALL wrong

[1:08:05] <dukenux> nah its a prewar thimg
[1:08:05] <%ItsRatman> Pat and getting lore wrong, is there a more iconic duo?
[1:08:06] <Coystick> They're sterile
[1:08:07] <OkamiDude15> the fire emblem virus
[1:08:08] <%Suplex9000> The master was a scientist that fell into the goo
[1:08:08] <VyperVic> @jimevera exactly
[1:08:08] <%kamen_advent> The Master found it by accident by falling into it
[1:08:09] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Make Paige play Fallout 1.
[1:08:10] <Meekest> They're here to be orcs

[1:08:25] <+moondog_> super sterile too
[1:08:26] <%TheSpiritof2277> Marcus was my big favorite
[1:08:26] <%claudesavegely> yeehaw
[1:08:29] <hazardkujacker> @AngriestPat The FEV was created bu the Enclavee, The Master fell into a vat of it and turned into The Master

[1:08:40] <%hamborhger> Super mutants are weird triploid banana-men lmao
[1:08:41] <+G_Thunders> In FO76 they were testing FEV pre-war in West Virginia so who even knows
[1:08:44] <%Skrypto> RIP Tony Jay
[1:08:45] <deviljhojho94> What happened to my sub
[1:08:45] <%kamen_advent> Fallout 3 Super Mutants also make no sense
[1:08:46] <alcors_wisdom> and then they eat them
[1:08:46] <$WETBUTTDISEASE> moon2S moon2S
[1:08:48] <deviljhojho94> apatDab
[1:08:48] <alexandrecau> bearded boone is an abomination
[1:08:49] <theruder9> The credit to Fallout 3 it deserves : It's world was more interesting then New Vegas'.
[1:08:50] <%ReallyRedRum> fallout 4's lore team can go fuck themselves
[1:08:50] <LunarLancaster> Super Mutants' dicks fall off when they mutate
[1:08:50] <%Suplex9000> @AngriestPat You might end up turning into a melted horror like a centaur.
[1:08:52] <$Tuskor13> They're like Piccolo they don't have dicks
[1:08:52] <SchroedingersFerret> This courier has no honor!
[1:08:53] <%ahegotrigger> they dont have weiners but they live a thousand years anyways
[1:08:53] <xeros720> Pat Vat
[1:08:54] <SirOinkens> moon2NOM
[1:08:55] <lich995> Finding that out and telling the Master about it was a great way to beat that encounter
[1:08:56] <Gruhunchously> The Lou Tennant
[1:08:56] <deviljhojho94> Oh I did not renew it LUL
[1:08:57] <%king_wragles> 76 does not count
[1:08:57] <%OwlLightningMage> Fawks is so fucking busted do to that stupid leveling glitch
[1:08:57] <lotharrio> FEV was made by the US government by accident while curing a "new plague." The Master was created by like three people falling into a vat of it and turning into a sort of... stew of people. The Master then invented Super Mutants and slowly tried to perfect them.
[1:08:58] <+Dreadlord134> 2 cool ones pat!!
[1:08:59] <alcors_wisdom> @ReallyRedRum yeah they can
[1:08:59] <DonatelloJose> Pat it WITHOUt honor
[1:09:04] <theruder9> Fallout 4 was a dumpster fire
[1:09:05] <+Gravisigoth> can they bone tho
[1:09:06] <%king_wragles> 76 is not canon, cause I don't want it to be
[1:09:06] <%TheSpiritof2277> Worf eats plastic barrels
[1:09:07] <TalisKanju> Bethesda screwed Fallout over
[1:09:07] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Worf is so good on DS9
[1:09:09] <Gregorhasjoined> Those barrels got no HONOR
[1:09:10] <%lewdskeletor13> @g_thunders They’ve been testing FEV since before the war forever in lore
[1:09:10] <+Sochin_Iitsu> Worf doesn't like barrels
[1:09:11] <deviljhojho94> NO HONOR
[1:09:11] <%pimpinahz> IT OS A GOOD DAY TO DIE!! lol gotta love Star Trek
[1:09:11] <%OwlLightningMage> They love to eat people
[1:09:12] <daisymaisy02> I like glancing at the screen to see Pat posing with d o r i t
[1:09:14] <PSI_Guy95> There's like 10 Worfs in the Star Trek Gacha game, my favorite is Civil War Worf
[1:09:15] <kingdudeby> FEV has a bunch of different strains that effect everything different.
[1:09:16] <synthcutter> everything eats everything in fallout tho
[1:09:17] <RichAnvils> Worf….Worf never changes
[1:09:17] <%T_Tarras> Fox and what is the old lady companion in this game ?
[1:09:18] <dukenux> People eat people in Falloyt
[1:09:18] <ScreamingMeat> Fallout 4 was ok
[1:09:19] <+Dreadlord134> WHATABOUTFAWKESYOUDICK!!
[1:09:20] <+Arsene48> I'm not down for that part either.
[1:09:21] <%Neo_Kaiser> There's a main story questline where you have to turn a smart Super Mutant back into a human so that he can use his fingers.
[1:09:22] <JetpackMcQuack> Can you enjoy Warf and barrels at the same time?
[1:09:24] <+mastertwin2> Modern Bethesda doesn't give a SHIT about lore
[1:09:25] <alcors_wisdom> @Gregorhasjoined warf's spine has no honor
[1:09:25] <Desertfishing> @AngriestPat replace boon with lily for shits n giggles
[1:09:25] <Gruhunchously> Civil Worf
[1:09:27] <%hamborhger> @PSI_Guy95 The Cival Worf if you will
[1:09:29] <grimnier> Some people that got tested on with FEV just because mentally ill in the first game
[1:09:29] <krewl123> @G_Thunders fallout 76 gets alot of old lore messed up/dont care about it soooo
[1:09:29] <hassanico> @T_Tarras Lily
[1:09:29] <%Suplex9000> I like that the hero from Fallout 2 is a caveman.
[1:09:29] <%LouieRouie> I M Weasel!
[1:09:32] <+diazflak> Enclave is a necessary evil voiced with the best president
[1:09:34] <Buka_Zero> sponsored by doritos
[1:09:35] <deviljhojho94> Im glad bethesda is getting their teeth kicked in tbh
[1:09:43] <theruder9> Fallout 4 was mediocre
[1:09:46] <$cerass> the mods need a crazy talk command that plays a noise when pat say something that's big WRONG
[1:09:47] <hassanico> @T_Tarras Lily the super mutant
[1:09:48] <%Shady_Zaku> local Klingons Spine SHATTERED by plastic barrel
[1:09:49] <%GwatchaSquatcha> fact
[1:09:49] <theruder9> like a 3/10 mediocre
[1:09:52] <Idon__> Fallout 4 was actual TRASH
[1:09:53] <dukenux> Bethesda ne like " whats lore? can i spend it?"
[1:09:55] <%megakruemel> Welp i'm off. have fun guys!
[1:09:55] <synthcutter> I was excited for Elder Scrolls VI, not anymore
[1:09:55] <%T_Tarras> @hassanico when I first met that super mutant i was amazed
[1:09:56] <kingdudeby> most mutants in fallout are a result of minute exposure to FEV. But huge exposure turns humans into super mutants
[1:09:56] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Fallout 4 is great... after a few hours of modding
[1:09:57] <%kiyingu_seesar> fallout 4 "better than BoS"
[1:09:57] <+diazflak> President John Henry Eden
[1:09:57] <alcors_wisdom> @theruder9 thats generous
[1:09:59] <daisymaisy02> I know Fallout 4 isn't good but I really do love it anyway
[1:10:00] <thelonechris> Fallout 4 sucked
[1:10:02] <%TombstoneTTromboners> correcy
[1:10:02] <synthcutter> it is bad
[1:10:02] <+The_monster_hunter> true
[1:10:03] <%kamen_advent> Fallout 3 is bad too
[1:10:05] <TalisKanju> The Enclave sucks in Fallout 3, just like the Brotherhood in that game
[1:10:05] <%TombstoneTTromboners> correct
[1:10:05] <%hamborhger> I hate the stats in 4'
[1:10:06] <%AncelDeLambert> FO4 is a TERRIBLE game
[1:10:06] <ProRJHunter> Yeah
[1:10:08] <hassanico> @T_Tarras Her sidequest is heartbreaking honestly
[1:10:09] <DifferentialDial> fallout 3 is also bad
[1:10:09] <HannibalBeerus> Gunplay good Story BAD
[1:10:09] <+palebluedots> It's okay
[1:10:12] <lotharrio> FEV also made psychics in FO1 which... well, every game has included at least one psychic since. Not including '76 though.
[1:10:12] <InsomniacPersona> @AngriestPat Yea, But FO 76 is the BEST... Right?
[1:10:12] <%lewdskeletor13> Oh chill you dorks
[1:10:13] <Coystick> F4 had a few nice moments surround by miles of miles of shit
[1:10:13] <TheAmazingClaytor> But....But Patshwitz...
[1:10:14] <%OwlLightningMage> Star Field will be good. We swear guys LUL
[1:10:15] <AggsMK7> Remember Jet? And how they didn't just use After Burner Gum or invent their own drug?
[1:10:15] <Meekest> FO4 and FO3 are both bad
[1:10:15] <$Tuskor13> Fallout 4 is a fun game but not a great Fallout game
[1:10:18] <SirOinkens> It was boring
[1:10:18] <%commanderclaw> Fallout 4 is disgustingly boring
[1:10:18] <hazardkujacker> Fallout 4 is Fallout 3 but worse
[1:10:20] <$nademonkey1100> anything after NV never happened
[1:10:20] <synthcutter> fallout 3 is meh
[1:10:21] <%DesperaDo2077> It's mediocre at best
[1:10:22] <%PenmanLupine> Fallout 4 is a fine game
[1:10:22] <redsynod> Litteral Skyrim with guns
[1:10:23] <soulsbjorne> hey Pat play Daughters of Chaos mod
[1:10:23] <DifferentialDial> fallout 3 is not good
[1:10:24] <%AncelDeLambert> it ruined the dialogue, it ruined the leveling, it ruined the WEAPONS
[1:10:25] <%Suplex9000> @AggsMK7 Jet let you jump superhuman distances
[1:10:25] <fallacy8> Fallout 4 is fine
[1:10:26] <thelonechris> 3 is better than 4
[1:10:26] <alcors_wisdom> just import the fallout NV perk system
[1:10:27] <%ItsRatman> Objectively its a good game, its just a god-awful Fallout game.
[1:10:27] <+Sochin_Iitsu> FO3 has problems
[1:10:28] <fallacy8> it's fine
[1:10:28] <deviljhojho94> Crazy talk not activating for once PogChamp
[1:10:28] <daisymaisy02> The companions challenge NV for best in the series imo
[1:10:29] <Danger_douglas> 3 is bad
[1:10:29] <Gorgen> 3 is overrated
[1:10:30] <%kamen_advent> Just joking mostly
[1:10:30] <lich995> I'm going to go with the "Sarcasam" response to that Pat
[1:10:30] <Superblooms> i enjoyed Fallout 4.
[1:10:30] <grauster> New Vegas is best Fallout
[1:10:31] <kingdudeby> FO4 is ok for what it is. But not much else
[1:10:31] <+palebluedots> fallout 3 is bad and empty
[1:10:31] <Meekest> I don't care for it sorry Paige
[1:10:32] <dukenux> F4 "dialogue" wheel NotLikeThis
[1:10:32] <Graywolf_the_45th> Fallout 3 is fine. Fallout 4 is just fucking awful
[1:10:33] <%FunTruker> They did with the NV mod
[1:10:34] <ScreamingMeat> There are Mods that bring back the old Perk and Stills system
[1:10:36] <lautalocos> fallout 3 aged really badly
[1:10:36] <%AncelDeLambert> 3 is fine
[1:10:36] <PettyFunk> I remember one of your companions giving you a bonus that glitched out and made all headshots 1000% accurate. I couldn't take it off and it sucked
[1:10:37] <deviljhojho94> 3 is better than 4
[1:10:37] <%homelesstwinky> FO3 has amazing atmosphere
[1:10:37] <%hamborhger> Ok, hot takes time: Fallout Tactics is good, maybe better than 3
[1:10:37] <Coystick> F3 is meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh
[1:10:37] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> FO4 is basically Bethesda deciding that that Fallout should be Bioshock with a different setting.
[1:10:38] <gustavozxd> fallout 4 was a game I enjoyed but never want to look at again
[1:10:39] <Izuurus> New Vegas is the betterrrr
[1:10:40] <synthcutter> new vegas is the ONLY good fallout game
[1:10:40] <PSI_Guy95> Hate Fallout 4!
[1:10:40] <+fantom_flasch> The story of 3 sucks but the game is good
[1:10:41] <%Skrypto> Fallout 4 is a ham sandwidge that got dropped on the floor
[1:10:41] <+Bob_Tom> fallout 4 is just ok but shit writing
[1:10:42] <sparkboy777> 3 is just SUPER over-rated.
[1:10:42] <SubjectX07x> Fallout 4 has a mod to change the perk system to new vegas'.
[1:10:42] <%OwlLightningMage> Fallout 3 is really good.
[1:10:42] <daisymaisy02> 4 is better than 3
[1:10:43] <viridianowl> New Vegas is the real Fallout 4.
[1:10:43] <dukenux> Fallout 3 is alright
[1:10:44] <%Shady_Zaku> PSYCHICS?!
[1:10:45] <TalisKanju> Little Lamplight is the WORST
[1:10:45] <RipSlamsteak> fallout 3 has been made worse by new vegas existing
[1:10:45] <%Shadowpint> 3 is flawed but still really fun
[1:10:46] <grauster> Fallout 4 = the baby the baby the baby
[1:10:46] <+DoubleKayga> Worst part of F4 for me was dialog being dumbed down to the wheel with only occasional persuasion checks
[1:10:47] <The_Sorrow_> oooooohhhh
[1:10:48] <Mnightshyamallama> YAY PAT STREAM
[1:10:48] <Desertfishing> its a good first 3d fallout game
[1:10:49] <anar_bael> Whats the appeal of fallout 3?
[1:10:50] <Ipsenscastle> Liam???
[1:10:50] <%ahegotrigger> OOOFF
[1:10:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> This but unironically
[1:10:51] <theruder9> Why does everyone compliment the gun play in Fallout 4? It was... better than this game
[1:10:52] <xeros720> was he a work or a shoot?
[1:10:52] <hassanico> New Vegas, for how good it is, is crazy unfinished
[1:10:52] <fallacy8> I liked 8.
[1:10:53] <InsomniacPersona> 3 is not good for RP cuz you have to go find your dad, you have no choice there
[1:10:53] <ProRJHunter> OOF
[1:10:54] <TalisKanju> Fallout 3 is not good.
[1:10:54] <%skizzuto> FF6 is better
[1:10:55] <%TheyCallMeVawn> Dragon Quest is better than Final Fantasy tho Kappa
[1:10:55] <+aivalera> NV is the best fallout, hands down... Except in terms of bugs.
[1:10:55] <fallacy8> and 9
[1:10:55] <el_patronn64> lol
[1:10:56] <Coystick> YEAH FF8!!! Good Kid!!
[1:10:56] <HannibalBeerus> FUCKING YEAH RIGHT
[1:10:56] <%sparrrow_> 13 isn't as bad as people make it out to be
[1:10:56] <%OwlLightningMage> That guy is trolling LUL
[1:10:56] <%crimsonharvest> if you discard 7 to boost EIGHT you are a HEATHEN and a SINNER OOHHHHHHHHHH
[1:10:57] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> hot takes
[1:10:58] <krymzen5> i was born after and i know!

[1:10:59] <+Ryosuke91> who r they talkin about?
[1:10:59] <%hamborhger> FUCC Fallout BOS though lmao
[1:11:00] <DisGuyOvahEre> @AngriestPat there is a mod that brings the skill system into fallout 4 called horizon. the perks basically just add skill points to the skills afterwards
[1:11:00] <Etherealizer> @AngriestPat there's actually a mod that brings New Vegas skill system into FO4- "LevelUpMenuEx"
[1:11:01] <LarryLemon> !uptime
[1:11:01] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 11m.
[1:11:01] <Superblooms> i didn't like 3 cause i played new vegas first.
[1:11:03] <+aivalera> FF 9 IS THE BEST!
[1:11:03] <pillowwasp> I prefer 3 to new Vegas but I love both
[1:11:03] <%cureneckbeard> nyannAngry

[1:11:04] <%OwlLightningMage> That fucker is trolling LUL
[1:11:05] <%SweetCheeksTrap> @penmanlupine Fallout 4 is ENDLESS TRASH
[1:11:05] <thelonechris> 3 is what got me into the series
[1:11:05] <hassanico> There's a ridiculous amount of stuff incomplete or dummied out of New Vegas, it's kinda nuts
[1:11:06] <+G_Thunders> @krewl123 oh I thought FO76’s story stuff works fine as a prequel story for the BoS, FEV, etc. it’s not told great but it’s fine imo
[1:11:07] <Izuurus> west coast best coast
[1:11:07] <grauster> FF8 is best FF obviously
[1:11:07] <daisymaisy02> Hot take train toot tooooooooooooot
[1:11:08] <hazardkujacker> FUCK It IS Sam Reigel
[1:11:08] <+PharosOfLight> ... I like 13...
[1:11:08] <%TheSpiritof2277> FF7 is real good! Just not the best like some people make it to be
[1:11:08] <+rotten2thebit> I like 8 BUT 7 is far superior

[1:11:14] <%kiiiirsten> Smoothskin
[1:11:14] <gustavozxd> 13 still laughably bad though
[1:11:14] <%DatLatinoGuy> eeeeeey smoothskin
[1:11:14] <+Sochin_Iitsu> That sounds like someone who likes 8 and 13 and was salty people hate them
[1:11:14] <markdreizehn> Believing 13 is a good game should make it so your humanity is revoked

[1:11:31] <grimnier> I feel like F3 is more in line with the first two games in terms of game style. New Vegas didn't give enough screen time to ghouls and super mutants
[1:11:31] <HeadsHeldHigh> stupid fool
[1:11:34] <fruitloop89> 8 is good, clemps is right about 9, 10 is fine, 12 is fantastic, but 5 is where its at

[1:12:48] <DonatelloJose> That's not good for your voice if you don't do it right, like most voice acting
[1:12:49] <Gruhunchously> But Veronica is fun and she punches people.
[1:12:49] <+Bob_Tom> I'd be a downer too if my wife was abducted and sold into slavery
[1:12:50] <randomp141> With Paige, Pat needs a "Strong Throat."
[1:12:52] <TalisKanju> Fallout 3 is inoffensive at best.
[1:12:53] <frogurtz> He's the best character in the game.
[1:12:54] <Buka_Zero> big throat for big boys

[1:14:26] <+Chud_Pudsley> @OkamiDude15 No
[1:14:27] <%kamen_advent> Honestly Ghouls trying to travel through space makes sense since they are immortal and radiation doesn't affect them so they don't need to worry about strong shielding
[1:14:27] <LarryLemon> mangoKrey mangoKrey mangoKrey mangoKrey mangoKrey
[1:14:27] <Shteaky> thats super dumb, why does he have a non ghoul voice

[1:41:25] <C_S_N_G> Rest in peace
[1:41:26] <Gruhunchously> This is the one you use if you don't want to kill.
[1:41:26] <%TheSpiritof2277> A fair kill
[1:41:26] <+SpamKingRathalos> Peace is a lie
[1:41:27] <underratedjustin> Symbol of Peace Pat strikes again.

[1:50:20] <+WaiL_FiN> @TheSpiritof2277 oh. I think they might ALL have dicks. I'm pretty sure the peaceful way to stop the Master is to point out to him that Super Mutants won't be able to take over because they all end up having male bodies, so they can't multiply to increase their numbers.
[1:50:21] <%Kahiir> isn't there a sprint in new vegas?

[1:51:23] <$grimpokemon> SECRET TUNNEL
[1:51:24] <alcors_wisdom> @SeventyForce technically yes but if theres enough radiation they can regenerate faster than they suffocate

[2:14:02] <%sparrrow_> Pat doesn't need napkins he just wipes his hands all over his shirt LUL
[2:14:04] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat .38 special is also 357

[2:14:17] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat if you use your big dick luck on the strip you can get yourself your favorite gun by clearing out one or two casinos
[2:14:17] <$awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 good to be back man. Hauling between 60-90 lbs of tech and trading cards back from my friend's house, cause he's too lazy to come to me. And then i get to wait in the cold for a bus for 20 min! Worst part is, because of the size of my coats, the stuff in the bookbags, and the strap size, if I take these off, I won't be able to get them back on! Oh well, such is the torture of existence.
[2:14:18] <CuttleCrow> but crafting is a no no for Pat

[2:14:33] <$codussalpha> @AngriestPat less damage but less weapon degrade!
[2:14:34] <%LocDogX86X> its true
[2:14:34] <+SpamKingRathalos> But Dragon Breath rounds are better, smell the cleansing.

[2:14:59] <loreofancients> grumpus refuses to try weapons
[2:15:00] <%LastSonofOdin> @AngriestPat 357 magnum is the type of round. its not just for magnums
[2:15:01] <$codussalpha> @AngriestPat .38 does less damage but hurts the gun less too!
[2:15:02] <%king_wragles> Buy some armor?

[2:30:32] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat Easiest way is to get This Machine is when you're at McCarran Airport you find the Quartermaster named Contreras and hack into his computer, then go talk to the NCR lady in the terminal who gives you quests; you'll have the option to turn him in, then she gives you the rifle
[2:30:32] <%PinkieTheEerie> it dose not suck

[2:30:45] <%OwlLightningMage> The train quest always bugged out for me
[2:30:46] <SnideTheCrow> @Bouerd 3rd highest grit damage in the game
[2:30:49] <Gruhunchously> The Ratslayer allows for 5x critical damage.

[2:39:51] <dukenux> Light is alsongood
[2:39:52] <Gruhunchously> Fun Fact: The reason Fallout 3 gives you such heavy damage reduction in VATS is that the game had a tendency to crash if you died in VATS. So rather than fix it properly, they elected to try and minimize the possibility of it happening.
[2:39:54] <Reaper_Clown> Has Pat done the BIG EMPTY yet?
[2:39:55] <%manwithboxonhead> The Skaven will remember this.

[2:47:11] <JittersCaffeine> The damage is lower and your aim is bad and your repoad is slow
[2:47:14] <%thatother1dude> Your gun sways when you aim it and VATS accuracy is worse.

[2:47:54] <%Suplex9000> @AngriestPat Naughty Nightwear increase luck +1
[2:47:54] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> sure it would be absurd to implement, but it's that problem I always have when videogames put you "in charge" of people
[2:47:55] <%FrustratedAF> test
[2:47:57] <%ThatGuyfromMars> patroling the mojave makes you wish for a nuclear winter

[2:48:12] <Ran196> don't you wanna be naughty Pat

[2:48:17] <Gruhunchously> Why wouldn't you want to wear the Naughty Nightwear Pat?
[2:48:18] <%thatother1dude> Gun damage is unrelated to skill requirements. You damage is base*(50%+skill*1/2*)
[2:48:21] <AlasterAngelo> nothing wrong with being a little naughty
[2:48:23] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat all you have to do is hack his compy
[2:48:24] <+SpamKingRathalos> Time to meet the supply guy

[2:48:59] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat Break into his computer upstairs
[2:48:59] <sparkboy777> @AngriestPat someone said earlier that you can hack his computer to get it?
[2:48:59] <+Bouerd> If you hack his terminal you can do it
[2:49:01] <%homelesstwinky> hack terminal upstairs
[2:49:03] <Rhinoprotoss> magazines

[2:54:34] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat I'll reiterate that you'll want a mod that specifically deals with This Machine's accuracy. Outside of VATS it's accuracy is utter dog shit and you won't be able to hit anything even with the VATS cancel trick.

[3:10:07] <hassanico> @dekkitout Dog Tags are for crafting gauntlets
[3:10:09] <squirtkitten> @VeryTricky they seem to run a strong leadership just because the underlings are uneducated former tribals. and if you speak out you die
[3:10:11] <$codussalpha> @AngriestPat he literally works in the shitiest shithole in the entire mojave shithole

[3:27:11] <FoxInABeret> Yeah, everybody really hates the Brotherhood in New Vegas. Even the Brotherhood.
[3:27:12] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Middle is best.
[3:27:12] <HyperBomb21> The Brotherhood has always been asholes
[3:27:13] <%punch_ghost> OLD WORLD BLUES
[3:27:13] <$Niney_Who> There is no After the Game

[3:27:13] <%commanderclaw> Do them in the middle
[3:27:14] <+MaddyCaddy> The Mojave Brotherhood is a dying breed of militarist technophobes that have no place in House's New Vegas
[3:27:15] <%camodikk> really wanna see Pat do teh Sierra Madre
[3:27:15] <poweredscoot> that's how brotherhood works

[3:27:17] <Enemy_In_Disguise> BOS suck
[3:27:18] <%mister___doctor> And here I thought the reason you wouldnt like him is because hes a fucking Totalotarian dictator. But I guess pettiness works too.

[3:27:18] <donkymagooterson> just do them
[3:27:18] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> @AngriestPat I believe there is a piece of cut content illustrating a peaceful end to that scenario

[3:27:23] <%Cavumentum> There is technically an order

[3:27:27] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> and she's freaking the fuck out
[3:27:27] <%Solidnick18> pat pls
[3:27:27] <dukenux> Brotherhood are just buncha basement dwelling nerds in this
[3:27:27] <JittersCaffeine> Fallout 4 is the only one with a bad Brotherhood
[3:27:28] <sileo_patronus> I think they have level recommendations
[3:27:28] <%TombstoneTTromboners> save lonesome road for before the ending
[3:27:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> THEYRE SO COOL
[3:27:29] <$Niney_Who> Except when they're Robo-racist
[3:27:29] <KeystoneA1> Canonically*
[3:27:31] <$awsomesaucekirby> Brotherhood sux
[3:27:32] <%lewdskeletor13> Canonically they happen before the end
[3:27:32] <mr_slaide> Dead money is better done early.
[3:27:32] <+SpamKingRathalos> dead money makes me happy at night
[3:27:33] <hassanico> oh noooooo
[3:27:33] <%crimsonharvest> they're not cool, they're the LEAST COOL

[3:27:34] <%vectorless_peon> big mt is the shit and that's where I stand
[3:27:36] <+TransporterX7> u mean u liek POWER ARMOR
[3:27:36] <hazardkujacker> @AngriestPat Lonesome Road should be dead last before the ending
[3:27:36] <Gruhunchously> Why does everyone like the Brotherhood so much?
[3:27:37] <a_waste_of_space_> fuck the BoS
[3:27:37] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat just loves to be wrong LUL
[3:27:37] <+ilasper1> fuck the brotherhood
[3:27:37] <CrypticMochi> Only time I liked the brotherhood was in 3, rest of the time they can fuck off
[3:27:39] <mightyfat> This is the same situation that made me quit this game
[3:27:39] <$spacehouse> BoS are backwards medieval tech hoarders
[3:27:40] <Mr_Strut> Brotherhood are big nerds
[3:27:40] <hassanico> Pat is a Brotherhood apologist?!
[3:27:41] <%Johnothon> @AngriestPat Do them if you get bored, and if they're not done by the end then you can go do them
[3:27:41] <Zael913> Screw the Brotherhood! Let's go ENCLAVE
[3:27:42] <+SpamKingRathalos> ENCLAVE
[3:27:42] <%LogothX> thats how mafia works
[3:27:44] <%Solidnick18> they have cool power armor that's it
[3:27:45] <$Piemono> The Brotherhood sends you on a suicide mission when you ask to join them
[3:27:46] <+G_Thunders> BoS is the worst
[3:27:48] <+JackMillerTime> fuck the Bos
[3:27:49] <dekkitout> they were cool in 1 and came full circle fascists in 4
[3:27:51] <+SpamKingRathalos> G E C K O
[3:27:52] <CuttleCrow> the brotherhood are assholes
[3:27:52] <CountNebula> Auld Lang Syne, brothers.
[3:27:53] <Sokumotanaka> @angriestpat speaking of DLC you plan on doing ff15 ignis's on stream?
[3:27:53] <randomp141> @JittersCaffeine the Fallout 4 B.O.S. are actually the closest to the actual B.O.S.
[3:27:54] <%crimsonharvest> the ONLY time the Brotherhood is cool is in Fallout 2 when they fuck off and never bother you once.
[3:27:54] <%OwlLightningMage> The brotherhood sucks in this game so hard LUL
[3:27:56] <lotharrio> Pat how do you feel about the Boomers?
[3:27:56] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> mood
[3:27:57] <Zola390> Even though it's great, I understand you skipping Dead Money. Do all the others though.

[3:27:59] <HyperBomb21> Based
[3:28:04] <%FrustratedAF> i have an idea: kill benny

[3:28:06] <hassanico> The Brotherhood are dicks! The only good Brotherhood member is freaking Danse
[3:28:06] <HefestoForges> EXCEPT HOUSE

[3:28:09] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat what's you're opinon on the boomers
[3:28:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> Brotherhood is a bit of a dick
[3:28:10] <%AppleBasket> Legion are kinda evil
[3:28:11] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Mr. House all the way
[3:28:13] <+moondog_> Brotherhood is pretty much cool in all games except 4
[3:28:13] <Valask> Legion is the best wdym
[3:28:14] <%NovaKnightmare> FUCK THE FIENDS
[3:28:17] <%xijiy> The legion are SUPER evil
[3:28:17] <+in_spaaace> The Legion did nothing wrong
[3:28:19] <Kataguro> Remove Fiends
[3:28:20] <lotharrio> I play that way, too. "Would leaving you alive, make potentially better stories, later on?"
[3:28:20] <fattyboy067> Legion or Great Khans?
[3:28:20] <Gruhunchously> Well, anyone looks cool when put next to the Enclave...
[3:28:21] <%jiin6> i Like the Khans

[3:28:22] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @hassanico did you just talk shit about my waifu
[3:28:23] <%TheSpiritof2277> Brotherhood are isolationist assholes who horde vital tech because they don't trust people to adapt
[3:28:23] <Zael913> Enclave is THE SHIT
[3:28:23] <spicyramengaming> Cali 4 Lyfe
[3:28:25] <HeadsHeldHigh> legion are fucking assholes even IF you side with them
[3:28:25] <a_waste_of_space_> but not House?
[3:28:27] <$CarlosEoM> fiends have got to go
[3:28:27] <%PalmtopNami> remnants are cool fulk u
[3:28:27] <%mister___doctor> But House is a dictator though
[3:28:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Fiends, Leigons, Powder Gangers etc
[3:28:28] <adamisfruit> The Legion aren’t overtly evil
[3:28:28] <%DesperaDo2077> Legion is for edgelords
[3:28:29] <+NiktenKing> the khans
[3:28:29] <slothslayer828> degenerate scum
[3:28:29] <%OwlLightningMage> The Brotherhood in this game are more stupid than the NCR
[3:28:29] <+TONYOO101> But those old enclave dudes are cool. Their war crimes make them radder.
[3:28:30] <vanagandr_hnd> the legion is pretty cool besides the you know, whole slavery thing
[3:28:30] <+SpamKingRathalos> Gotta slay COOKCOOK
[3:28:31] <+CaptainJax> brotherhood literally slaughter innocents to get laser guns
[3:28:32] <Gruhunchously> Ahhhhhhh

[3:28:42] <+Kilik_> @hassanico that's fo4 my man
[3:28:42] <tealwolf26> I don't blow up factions because I want more content and there's never an option to replace them. Just more empty space which is lame.
[3:28:43] <dekkitout> legion literally erases cultures tho NotLikeThis
[3:28:45] <%Solidnick18> dead
[3:28:46] <%NovaKnightmare> Evil bandits in anything are shit tier villains
[3:28:46] <+JackMillerTime> Ncr Dead! Legion Dead! BoS Dead!
[3:28:46] <Kataguro> Did they just sit there all day waiting for someone to show up?
[3:28:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> hey instead of trying to mass produce tech. Why don't we hoard all this knowledge
[3:28:49] <+UncleBust> BoS is the worst of the group that gets to live
[3:28:50] <+Trtickster> Is this run pure NCR? Or NCR until YesMan?
[3:28:51] <Gruhunchously> Dropped like a stone.

[3:29:34] <%mister___doctor> Realistically Mr Houses plan could not lead to anything other than a fascist government
[3:29:35] <JittersCaffeine> You can use a console command to see your Karma

[3:54:36] <spicyramengaming> I mean you can use VATS to highlight where enemies are too.

[3:54:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeyeye
[3:54:56] <CountNebula> Boone on his own is good. Boone + E-DE perk means you're literally never caught by surprise.

[3:54:59] <Conky89> If you thought if he was nuts now, you should have seen him when the game was first released!

[3:55:41] <%ElenaManetta> The little Fallout guy should be giving a thumbs up
[3:55:42] <+jisang0415> @DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap huh

[3:56:03] <+RadioactiveCanuck> that one football game they made? Stealth Throwin' Arm
[3:56:04] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @CuttleCrow I feel like that can also apply to a lot of suppressed snipers out there
[3:56:06] <+ThePayphone> watching pat only aim with vats is like watching one of those legend of zelda runs where they only side step
[3:56:08] <Kataguro> Raul never did find peace with himself
[3:56:10] <+jisang0415> only if rex had a gun

[4:07:39] <GreatestGuess> You did it!
[4:07:39] <Riverinah> spilled pink gin all over myself so you have to attempt it
[4:07:39] <CountNebula> Keep walking forward, Pat, the Four Kings will show up eventually.
[4:07:41] <$Niney_Who> It's just a tiny little thingy not a dungeon
[4:07:46] <CuttleCrow> This cave is for real gamers only
[4:07:49] <%Shady_Zaku> Imprisoning me, all that I see absolute HORROR
[4:07:49] <Coystick> Well done!!
[4:07:51] <anar_bael> IS THIS ANOR LONDO
[4:07:52] <donkymagooterson> the cave is a lie
[4:07:54] <+bigirontarkus> The Woolie hole is an illusion
[4:07:55] <scottyispimpin13> Dummy
[4:07:55] <JittersCaffeine> I think that's for the Pit wuest
[4:07:55] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Oh okay. Ya done did good.

[4:08:01] <+faithless_zealot> @HeadsHeldHigh Ah, I see. Thanks for the heads up. What was the drama about? and Are Liam and Matt also doing a Twitch thing?
[4:08:02] <gwbtoast> Kiryu would have punched his way inside
[4:08:02] <+saaceye> NOT A CAVE
[4:08:04] <blizard_117> That's how Bethesda pushing early release works
[4:08:04] <JittersCaffeine> excuse me, The Thorn
[4:08:07] <mr_slaide> Big dick Pat, strikes again.
[4:08:08] <Dingo_Eejit> Tha Four King!?!? LEL

[4:09:08] <dekkitout> go go desert rangers!
[4:09:08] <%Fidel_Castbro> the only cool thing about the NCR is the Elite Ranger gear
[4:09:13] <%InsaneJackLondon> sick armor guys
[4:09:14] <%OwlLightningMage> Gamer goo rangers
[4:09:15] <Coystick> Le Wasteland reference
[4:09:18] <dukenux> i read that as "oh my god bowser died"
[4:09:22] <+saaceye> @DSD24 good stuff right? it was an interesting watch for sure
[4:09:24] <Desertfishing> oh ya forgot he's got his buttercup
[4:09:26] <JittersCaffeine> THere's a door you can go into but you'll get into trouble
[4:09:26] <spicyramengaming> Desert Rangers and NCR Rangers are different factions, I believe.
[4:09:27] <$D4C_Trice> NCR Ranger gear is sick looking and is the best non power armour gear you can get.
[4:09:28] <%Faustgesicht> lad's life

[4:09:49] <alrobot2014> lets get a theoretical degree in physics
[4:09:50] <%Disname23> Yeah Desert Rangers are the elite of the NCR Rangers
[4:09:54] <%DONGWAVE> ORBiTAL BEAM CANNON!
[4:09:57] <%Disname23> which is an already elite group
[4:09:57] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Are you gonna become one of those cam guys where you strip during the stream?
[4:09:58] <%nanov11> mr fan fucking tastic
[4:10:01] <dukenux> this guy

[4:10:07] <dukenux> this fuckimg guy
[4:10:09] <CuttleCrow> Mr. Todd Howard
[4:10:10] <DSD24> @saaceye I won't go into spoilers but while all the endings were pretty good one really stuck out to me as awesome
[4:10:11] <%Shady_Zaku> The Chad NCR ranger gear > The Virgin Legion skirt
[4:10:11] <blizard_117> Go get the Target C Finder from that kid on Freeside please
[4:10:12] <HeadsHeldHigh> @faithless_zealot Not really any drama, it was just that Matt and Pat felt they no longer had the level of fun they had in the beginning, so they decided to go separate ways. Matt's solo stuff is great, and you can look forward to Pat and woolie stuff in the future
[4:10:12] <Coystick> @spicyramengaming Desert Rangers became the NCR Rangers, they're a Wasteland reference
[4:10:13] <%manwithboxonhead> Would you rather be bored, fight frantically for your life all the time, or be Stubby?

[4:24:39] <xIgnitionCrowx> You must not like money if you dont
[4:24:40] <+Kilik_> Dead Money is awesome
[4:24:44] <Conky89> just don't mind the traps and yeah, dead money is great
[4:24:44] <%lewdskeletor13> Old World Blues tho apatDab
[4:24:44] <Riverinah> Pat is the best drunk stream
[4:24:44] <%dozind16> Pat, New season of Mob Psycho
[4:24:45] <%DesperaDo2077> *Honest Hearts
[4:24:46] <dagreenpillow> is Pat gonna fight Woolie in the Divide?
[4:24:46] <deviljhojho94> The worst is honest hearts
[4:24:49] <jonathandemel> Honest Hearts is shit, fucking savage shit-flinger
[4:24:49] <$Mornaka> I like big empty
[4:24:50] <+Flambage> Dead Money gameplay is rough but the story and characters are great
[4:24:50] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Ohhhhhh man, it's gonna be great, I love the difficulty spike that is Dead Money
[4:24:51] <%TheSpiritof2277> Dead Money's brilliant, just challenging af between the fog and bear traps
[4:24:52] <mr_slaide> No. Die.
[4:24:53] <Gruhunchously> I really like Dead Money, but I can't deny that it's a trash fire. Especially for a stream.
[4:24:54] <%nanov11> i am a old world blues fan but dead money does some great stuff
[4:24:55] <%Shady_Zaku> I love how split opinions are here
[4:24:56] <+mar2503> Dead Money is the best one
[4:24:57] <Sydin18> My only problem with dead money is that u couldnt get a ranger suit to match the hat D:
[4:24:57] <Coystick> See this is how you know it's good, some people love it, some HATE it
[4:24:58] <alrobot2014> dead money is great but tedious
[4:24:58] <Stratrat> @AngriestPat what about Wolfenstein 2? get to kill nazis :D
[4:25:00] <GetWicked> Dead Money is terrible
[4:25:06] <Izuurus> owb for future jazz
[4:25:06] <TootPirate> how can you say something so controversial, yet so brave?
[4:25:06] <+WaiL_FiN> @mimikyu92 first of all that weapon sucks. it explodes way too close to be practical. Second of all, I think that's in Fallout 3, not New Vegas.
[4:25:07] <DSD24> Joshua Graham is the best part of Honest Hearts
[4:25:07] <mr_slaide> Dead money sucks.
[4:25:08] <GueyDuckB> All that gold though
[4:25:11] <+SWFanatic> i like old world blues
[4:25:14] <deviljhojho94> Old world blues is the best one
[4:25:16] <spicyramengaming> The traps, the unkillable sentries, the hordes of Ghost People...yeah, good times LUL
[4:25:16] <%yoshkosh20> old world blues. seduce the one brain with ASMR
[4:25:19] <%Nobrev> I had fun with dead money
[4:25:23] <KeystoneA1> DM is fine. Those gold bars are pretty great, especially if you know how to steal all of them
[4:25:24] <%lewdskeletor13> Dead Money gameplay sucks, wriyis good
[4:25:26] <dekkitout> to bad you cant get leprechaun's gold in dead money
[4:25:28] <ZebraBiscuits> Honest Hearts is the worst DLC, the rest are all great
[4:25:28] <%IMDRanged> Honest Hearts was kinda short, unless I played it wrong by going to wipe out the WightLegs
[4:25:28] <ScreamingMeat> Old World Blues is best imo
[4:25:31] <+SWFanatic> pitt was the worst
[4:25:31] <spicyramengaming> Old World Blues is dope
[4:25:31] <fruit_pie_the_magician> YOu CAN GET INTO DEAD MONEY WITH THE MATERIALS TO MAKE A DEATHCLAW HANDS
[4:25:37] <%LtThunderbolt> i like Dead moneys story
[4:25:39] <Riverinah> I feel like despite new vegas being the best, there are so many mundane bits
[4:25:41] <shurtal> Pat, you're a Trap Roomba
[4:25:42] <+BishopBain> PULSE GRENADES Kreygasm
[4:25:43] <%TheSpiritof2277> Yeah, the sentry-holograms I think are the worst part of it gameplay-wise
[4:25:43] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Are you planning to get the mod for Dead Money that stops the collars from blowing up?
[4:25:47] <+SimplesRock> Pat, glad you’re still online! Great meeting you at Magfest!
[4:25:47] <+Kilik_> Dead Money, Old World Blues, Lonesome Road, Honest Hearts for me
[4:25:49] <KeystoneA1> If you break the Sierra Madre's casino you get those vending machine coins and can buy thousands of ammo and food
[4:25:50] <Gruhunchously> Dead Money plus a stream would be a nightmare. Yo can't afford that kind of destraction.
[4:25:52] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> What did our money look like before the FallOut? Probably had trump on it
[4:25:53] <DSD24> If you have decent Melee then Dead Money is fine
[4:25:54] <tealwolf26> yea Dead Money story is good gameplay is tedious
[4:26:03] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @randomp141 why does that mod exist?
[4:26:04] <%DONGWAVE> WOOLIE HOLE
[4:26:05] <+BishopBain> Wait, what does Boone think of not giving power to what the NCR wants?
[4:26:06] <Coystick> Dead Money>Lonesome Road>Old World Blues>Honest Hearts/ Don't even attempt to @ me
[4:26:08] <%LtThunderbolt> true
[4:26:11] <+Kilik_> @SWFanatic Pitt was fo3, but still i liked it
[4:26:12] <Riverinah> btw i love u
[4:26:14] <+RioGascar> @angriestpat excited for outer worlds? It seems to have all the old fallout stuff returning in full force. Even stat based dialogue (like if you are more charasmatic all your dialogue is changed or if you are low int it also affects)
[4:26:21] <Stratrat> did they ever do something for wolfenstein 2 on the channel they used to run?
[4:26:22] <Gruhunchously> Where is he? You're Uncle Sam?
[4:26:22] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @randomp141 that's the defining gameplay elelment
[4:26:23] <%mimikyu92> @WaiL_FiN ye, but tiny tots do the same thing as the mirv
[4:26:24] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @Coystick @@@@@@@@@
[4:26:24] <%NovaKnightmare> Mr Gutsy with a light voice is bizarre
[4:26:25] <+SWFanatic> really? whups. been a long time
[4:26:31] <randomp141> @Youwereeatenbyalid IDK, probably for people like me who don't like the insane crawl it is.
[4:26:33] <GetWicked> @Coystick wrong
[4:26:35] <DSD24> @Stratrat Don't think they did
[4:26:37] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> The parts of Dead Money that really screwed me were where you needed to bring Christine and the arealeading up to the vault itself
[4:26:43] <%manwithboxonhead> At least you are not Mr.Stubby
[4:26:45] <+smargh1015> one thing i didnt like about nv is that the robot voices are way worse
[4:26:47] <%Skrypto> Personal Message" You left the Front door open"
[4:26:49] <randomp141> @Youwereeatenbyalid Also I hate that blind long run you have to do.
[4:26:50] <Coystick> @GetWicked @Breakfast_Megapowers how dare
[4:26:52] <%Shady_Zaku> SCRAP FOR REPAIRS hgah
[4:27:05] <jonathandemel> Dean in Dead Money can suck my dick
[4:27:15] <+WaiL_FiN> ***
[4:27:16] <Stratrat> i just bought it today for 15 bucks and holy hell is it fun killing nazis @DSD24
[4:27:16] <dekkitout> youre in for it now, commie
[4:27:19] <dukenux> I liked the Zion NP, but HH is kinda eh
[4:27:21] <Monograxo> rude
[4:27:22] <DSD24> Dean's a huge dick
[4:27:23] <Riverinah> notice me pat-san
[4:27:30] <Stratrat> i think itd be fun for him to stream
[4:27:36] <+Theophilus567> I love HH for the survivalist rifle.
[4:27:41] <dukenux> oh and Burned Man is cool i guess
[4:27:42] <%mimikyu92> The best thing about deanis that you get to kill him
[4:27:46] <Conky89> Turns out that Dean has the lowest karma of any character in the game.
[4:27:49] <randomp141> And Pat missed a skill book
[4:27:52] <dekkitout> burned man is metal incarnate
[4:27:53] <%ThePuddingDead> So Im assuming Pat went for liking guys in this game due to a large surplus of male npc's to take advantage of then?
[4:27:53] <Izuurus> honest hearts has coolest character and survivalist rifle
[4:27:53] <%Shady_Zaku> Your armour is trashed get scrap
[4:27:58] <%nanov11> you got me modding skyrim again been modding more then playing
[4:27:59] <dukenux> @theophilus567 yeyeye
[4:28:00] <%yoshkosh20> HH was the one with the burned man, yeah?
[4:28:04] <DSD24> @Theophilus567 The Survivalist's armor is great too
[4:28:04] <+Cheese_Whizard> Really hope Pat does Dead Money
[4:28:07] <alrobot2014> @ThePuddingDead yep
[4:28:12] <DSD24> @yoshkosh20 Yep Joshua Graham
[4:28:18] <SnideTheCrow> dead money is infuriating
[4:28:19] <mr_slaide> He will do dead money, even if it's shitty.
[4:28:20] <eldritchart> please assume the position
[4:28:20] <%lewdskeletor13> Where FISTO at?
[4:28:23] <Cheapheatmo> maybe they drank a lot of beer!
[4:28:26] <Kataguro> Freeside
[4:28:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> brotherhood?
[4:28:27] <dukenux> you can also get a cool unique ranger armor
[4:28:28] <randomp141> The B.O.S. was here before NCR pat.

[4:28:33] <Kataguro> Wow, that spooked me
[4:28:33] <deviljhojho94> Just kill them all patricio
[4:28:33] <Riverinah> HH brings bit back to the survivalist roots
[4:28:34] <+brovietto> well the brotherhood held the plant for a while
[4:28:34] <%TaifuDragon> People had bottles before the war Pat
[4:28:34] <%mimikyu92> the brotherhood were her before the ncr
[4:28:36] <%Nobrev> they drank a lot of soda and some dude was collecting them
[4:28:37] <%ahegotrigger> lot of bottle cap collectors
[4:28:38] <+BishopBain> LUL
[4:28:39] <%mister___doctor> BETHESDAA- oh wait it's not their fault this time
[4:28:40] <%TheSpiritof2277> Please assume the position
[4:28:40] <Ran196> people collect bottlecaps caps
[4:28:41] <sparkboy777> LOL
[4:28:41] <dekkitout> pushed into a ravine -while on fire- and basically becomes a bogey man
[4:28:42] <zeroraider> LUL

[4:28:58] <dekkitout> give him a flaming chain and hes basically ghost rider
[4:28:58] <%Shady_Zaku> PULSE
[4:29:02] <DonatelloJose> Sound e like the dio the world sound
[4:29:02] <randomp141> It's because the B.O.S. was here before the NCR got here. It's actually explained.
[4:29:06] <+Doctor_Stew> I like how that hole in it's face got repaired when you shot it's head off.
[4:29:07] <calamarvelous> Why isn't Boone a fat fuck

[4:30:06] <DSD24> BOS were in here before NCR
[4:30:06] <dekkitout> well now-
[4:30:10] <+Theophilus567> I think the tiny scope is supposed to take in light for the night vision to work.
[4:30:13] <attractdistract> Old World Blops
[4:30:15] <+Doctor_Stew> @lotharrio thats why fo76 is the best fo, theres no jet in any pre war installations
[4:30:16] <sparkboy777> @AngriestPat there were tapes in ther btw.
[4:30:16] <tealwolf26> fighting is good xp

[4:30:23] <+SWFanatic> until the sundowning is complete
[4:30:24] <randomp141> @AngriestPat The B.O.S. was here before the NCR took over.
[4:30:30] <lotharrio> @Doctor_Stew is there any Jet at all?
[4:30:31] <HefestoForges> LUL

[4:30:34] <%IMDRanged> Screen at crotch level
[4:30:35] <+amazinggamingchannel> use your Fixin Things Mag
[4:30:37] <%lewdskeletor13> @lotharrio Jet being made in Fallout 2 was contradicted in that game itself. Somebody describes getting addicted to Jet years before it was even made
[4:30:38] <+Doctor_Stew> @lotharrio nope
[4:30:39] <ccdrchau> USE THE MAGAZINE
[4:30:39] <%Gatzarlok> Besides mr.gutsy/the big murder bots, the prewar military bots look like you could just push them over in a fight.
[4:30:43] <dukenux> but can it run Doom
[4:30:44] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> gee pat, why would you ever carry around GARBAGE?!?

[4:36:27] <%lewdskeletor13> @ayershov777 He did not
[4:36:28] <%Gatzarlok> Why does the Mojave need more power? They've got the hydro dam, not like there's that much sucking from the grid anymore
[4:36:42] <CuttleCrow> no, its here
[4:36:42] <+RioGascar> Because the ncr is vergil
[4:36:43] <%Disname23> The dam only powers the Strip
[4:36:43] <%crimsonharvest> Preeeeeeetty sure only the boomer base has more
[4:36:45] <mr_slaide> It's at the boomer base.
[4:36:46] <dekkitout> the hydro damn is whats being fought over
[4:36:47] <%PenmanLupine> that is at the boomer base, but you pick up the panels here
[4:36:47] <DracaenaLeaf> good luck finding them lol
[4:36:48] <silvcrest> Its here Pat
[4:36:49] <+RioGascar> THEY BEED MORE POWER
[4:36:50] <Kataguro> Do it now so you don't have to come back
[4:36:50] <%maskedriderhero> Boomers and zoomers
[4:36:51] <calamarvelous> I'm rock solid.
[4:36:55] <Desertfishing> thats boomer you get the panels here
[4:36:55] <mr_slaide> Don't listen to the noob.
[4:36:56] <+aivalera> Their on the floor i think
[4:36:57] <Sydin18> I am sure there is one with crack
[4:36:58] <%TheSpiritof2277> It's Boomer base, but you can strip parts from here
[4:36:58] <%lewdskeletor13> UNLIMITED POWAH
[4:36:59] <+lexitheshark> @AngriestPat You can salvage some here to help with the Bommer base
[4:37:00] <silvcrest> You have to actually look
[4:37:01] <%Paralurx> Ur face is rock solid
[4:37:02] <eldritchart> here too, but annoying to find
[4:37:02] <ayershov777> you can get spare parts from those solar panels to fix the boomer panels
[4:37:02] <+atin2000> @AngriestPat the only thing you can do here is get parts for the ones at the boomer base
[4:37:02] <Kataguro> They're in the back of the rows
[4:37:03] <mothisamonster> bammers an wammers
[4:37:04] <DefectoRoboto> its at the boomers
[4:37:05] <%BlackJack607> I'm solid rock.
[4:37:06] <+timblenaut> they are obviously broken
[4:37:07] <+ItsCore19> they were needed for a mission
[4:37:09] <CuttleCrow> theres like 3
[4:37:09] <+aivalera> Oooh it’s boomers
[4:37:11] <Shiranui24> @RioGascar beed?
[4:37:11] <godsabove> it's at the boomer base, but you can find broken panels to salvage here
[4:37:11] <bogan1998> its parts
[4:37:14] <+aivalera> Probably
[4:37:14] <%Shady_Zaku> Keep looking
[4:37:17] <a_waste_of_space_> yeah near the terminals
[4:37:18] <mr_slaide> Boomers. Ignore the noob.
[4:37:19] <+RioGascar> Shhhh
[4:37:21] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat those are needed for the boomers not here
[4:37:27] <ScreamingMeat> Around the panels
[4:37:28] <%Shady_Zaku> You find parts FOR Boomers later here
[4:37:32] <Gruhunchously> @Gatzarlok Redundancy. The dam is under threat from the Legion, and if it goes, the power outages could be disastrous.
[4:37:33] <%lizard0tm> You can't get them until you need them I think
[4:37:34] <WidestCarnival> !uptime
[4:37:34] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 37m.
[4:37:35] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat wwith your repair you won't even need them
[4:37:36] <+Theophilus567> Yeah. I think that’s right. Scrap them for later.
[4:37:36] <%IMDRanged> Repair stuff
[4:37:37] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> "you'll find the first near the tents behind the western terminal; walking along the outer row and the fence towards the eastern terminal will produce the next three; the final one is by the tents near the eastern terminal. "
[4:37:38] <DSD24> Black Mountain has Raul
[4:37:39] <dekkitout> come to think of it- What would the Legion even need a hydro electric dam for?
[4:37:43] <bogan1998> theres like 3 or 4 of them
[4:37:49] <Mr_Strut> I don't think you even need the parts if your repair is high enough.
[4:37:49] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> wait no
[4:37:53] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> repair not salvage
[4:37:54] <Kataguro> You need like 3 I think

[4:39:30] <alexandrecau> why didn't ignacio gave the big book to fantastic?
[4:39:31] <spicyramengaming> He did solve it
[4:39:31] <%rosemon5001> a dude bro at the controls of a power plant
[4:39:32] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> oh fair point
[4:39:32] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @SimplesRock sure did
[4:39:36] <KeystoneA1> @SimplesRock Yes.
[4:39:38] <CuttleCrow> G U N
[4:39:38] <%mister___doctor> @AngriestPat If you kill Fantastic nobody there gives a shit
[4:39:39] <ape_hawk> by the way, if you arm the archimedes, then the legion takes over helios one and fantastic joins them
[4:39:40] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> pat actually thinking ahead
[4:39:42] <godsabove> @ElenaManetta they don't know how it works. That's why they hired Fantastic
[4:39:42] <%OwlLightningMage> There is no weapon LUL
[4:39:43] <%ElenaManetta> This plan requires many people to be stupid
[4:39:43] <%rdark_ksu> hammer of dawn
[4:39:45] <spicyramengaming> Fantastic Army
[4:39:46] <%BlackJack607> There's also the chance that he accidently sets it off and destroys everything.
[4:39:46] <%nanov11> good point
[4:39:52] <%bread_assassin> Did Pat divert power to the ACHIMEDES II?
[4:39:56] <alrobot2014> no
[4:39:56] <Mr_Strut> no
[4:39:57] <%Romulus1213> !uptime
[4:39:57] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 39m.
[4:39:57] <%ThatGuyfromMars> no
[4:39:58] <tealwolf26> no
[4:39:58] <silvcrest> No
[4:39:59] <Kataguro> He did it to Everyone
[4:40:02] <CuttleCrow> no, he was a good boy
[4:40:03] <Mr_Strut> Cause he a bitch
[4:40:04] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat did not LUL
[4:40:09] <%yoshkosh20> until the get in a new guy when fantastic inevitably gets himself electrocuted to death
[4:40:10] <%JGardner88> Or he sets of Archimedes I and kills everyone on site except himself
[4:40:11] <mr_slaide> Nobody has more Pat ethic than Pat.
[4:40:14] <tealwolf26> Pat wants THE POWAH!
[4:40:14] <lotharrio> Pat's so smart, he tricks people into letting him suck THEIR dicks.
[4:40:15] <Desertfishing> pat is for the people
[4:40:16] <Gruhunchously> If you do this quest the NCR's way, Fantastic gets transferred to Hoover Dam.
[4:40:19] <bogan1998> why are they alive still?
[4:40:25] <%mister___doctor> This entire quest seems like something YMS would rant about for 5 minutes
[4:40:26] <%manwithboxonhead> Well shit, what if you wanted to be the Lord of the Wasted Lands?
[4:40:29] <%Gatzarlok> @AngriestPat You should get the smart armor from one of the vaults
[4:40:32] <Kataguro> Will Boone be okay if you call that guy a bitch?
[4:40:32] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @lotharrio and then they catch the GAY
[4:40:36] <+Cheese_Whizard> Cause 1) pat hates lasers and 2) It's a bad buggy gun
[4:40:39] <%PROUD2beGINGER> apatHoldon
[4:40:39] <%emillionghost> can you kill npcs?
[4:40:40] <%BlackJack607> Pats been playin for a while now
[4:40:45] <%Shady_Zaku> Time to disrespect some monuments!
[4:40:45] <mr_slaide> Needs more Pat ethic.
[4:40:46] <%OwlLightningMage> I hope Outer Worlds is less of buggy mess
[4:40:47] <%nanov11> memory leaks yay
[4:40:48] <ScreamingMeat> Why does it do thta?
[4:40:49] <Mr_Strut> The troubles begin
[4:40:49] <+RioGascar> i like how the entire quest relays on everyone being stupid even the guy who isn’t stupid
[4:40:50] <alrobot2014> is this because of the memory leak
[4:40:52] <+patman22897> Shoot the monument at Boulder City
[4:40:52] <%yoshkosh20> Boone would spit in his face.
[4:40:52] <%rdark_ksu> insult the family of the fallen soldier. its the shitlord thing to do
[4:40:53] <+Coolnessishere> suffering from success
[4:40:53] <%mister___doctor> More like Fallout Poo Vegas
[4:40:54] <spicyramengaming> How does anyone hate lasers?
[4:40:58] <%lizard0tm> BLACK SCREEN
[4:40:59] <%ElenaManetta> Did Paige record the Superbeast theme song yet for the podcast?
[4:41:01] <%TheSpiritof2277> Go shit on that war-monument, yeyeye
[4:41:01] <%lewdskeletor13> SHOOT THE MEMORIAL apatDab
[4:41:02] <ayershov777> @AngriestPat What's your favorite faction?
[4:41:03] <%Aleate> How much longer are we playing tonight? :)
[4:41:04] <pulllp> @emillionghost yes
[4:41:08] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat is the memory leak in new vegas as bad as in dragon age origins
[4:41:11] <Cheapheatmo> Employees are our GREATEST ass
[4:41:11] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Did you crash it again?
[4:41:17] <bogan1998> yes
[4:41:19] <clonexsniperx> did the terminal even have a password on it or the next person to access it has control of the weapon?
[4:41:21] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[4:41:21] <%SiameseSneeze> Do it!
[4:41:22] <%Shady_Zaku> I love lazers...but Guns are king and plentiful
[4:41:22] <%TheSpiritof2277> LUL
[4:41:23] <+RioGascar> Outer worlds might be the least buggy obsidian game. Its apparently been in dev for 2 years before they showed it at ghe game awards
[4:41:23] <deviljhojho94> WOAH!
[4:41:23] <spicyramengaming> Boomers are best faction
[4:41:24] <ProRJHunter> LUL

[4:41:50] <%Nobrev> pop
[4:41:54] <bogan1998> sneaky assassins
[4:41:54] <deviljhojho94> Fucking radical

[4:42:05] <randomp141> @Taisuru A Super Best Friend.
[4:42:05] <VeryTricky> what difficulty is this on?
[4:42:05] <%jiin6> Ceasar's marked you for Death AND THE LEGION OBEYS

[4:42:09] <%Stevennapalm> Jesus his head is gone
[4:42:20] <%Implosivestar> EDF kill em all
[4:42:20] <%lewdskeletor13> @mr_slaide Because they’re the ones doing the crimes. Like rape. Slavery. Mass murder.
[4:42:21] <Electrorgasm> @AngriestPat Have you checked out the Daughters of Ash DaS mod?
[4:42:22] <deviljhojho94> THERMIC LANCE ! PogChamp
[4:42:23] <%Raxus_Secundus> No one expects the legionary inquistion
[4:42:23] <alexandrecau> like they all aggroed the robot
[4:42:26] <AirlineFood74> tf's a thermic lance?
[4:42:27] <%AbnormalVoid> THERMIC LANCE
[4:42:28] <MidnightSnack69> if they are larping romans, then calm wouldnt be very incharacter. they hadnt invented it yet
[4:42:31] <dekkitout> who knew a dictatorial society would be safe and 'peaceful'
[4:42:31] <%TheSpiritof2277> but retribution tho
[4:42:32] <tealwolf26> chest high walls. chest high walls, chest high walls...
[4:42:32] <Gorgen> jermaRat What meat?!
[4:42:33] <%maskedriderhero> Guys, would you watch a Star Wars movie that is just Seven Samurai but with Jedi?
[4:42:33] <+Cheese_Whizard> THERMIC LANCE
[4:42:35] <Gruhunchously> ED-E's killed so many of them that they've sort of forgotten about you in the meantime.
[4:42:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> exp
[4:42:42] <%AbnormalVoid> Thermic Lance is the strongest Melee Weapon in the game lmao
[4:42:50] <AirlineFood74> oh neat
[4:42:51] <%ThePuddingDead> Paige ok?
[4:42:52] <spicyramengaming> THERMIC LANCE BOIS
[4:42:54] <%Raxus_Secundus> @maskedriderhero yep
[4:42:55] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Get the Thermic Lance it will solve more problems than it's weight.
[4:43:00] <mr_slaide> @lewdskeletor13 And yet their society is less corrupt and failing than the NCR.
[4:43:03] <%TheSpiritof2277> Thermic lance is so broken, it's amazing
[4:43:04] <ScreamingMeat> Least they have good gear. Good way to get Trail Carbines, Brush Guns, Shishkebabs, and more
[4:43:05] <+Cheese_Whizard> @AngriestPat Thermic Lance tho
[4:43:08] <xeros720> watch pat ignore the thermic lance to spite all of you
[4:43:08] <%ElenaManetta> I always loved the sound of fucking duct tape when you fix things
[4:43:13] <TalisKanju> Pat talking to himself again?
[4:43:15] <CuttleCrow> welp, pat's going to sell that thing
[4:43:21] <%ThePuddingDead> pretty much
[4:43:27] <AirlineFood74> F
[4:43:27] <ReapandKnow> time to hit the gym
[4:43:34] <Rhinoprotoss> BOO
[4:43:35] <+Cheese_Whizard> Why do you hurt us like this
[4:43:37] <spicyramengaming> THERMIC LANCE OP THO
[4:43:37] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Fun fact: Thermic lance can trigger the Meltdown perk, so if you have both, you'll end up blowing yourself up!
[4:43:38] <CuttleCrow> don't give it to boone or anything
[4:43:38] <randomp141> Booze and Buffout to solve the weight
[4:43:43] <dukenux> Theres no corruption if you law allows you to do everything *pokes temple*
[4:43:48] <soullesskin> Goodluck at the gym
[4:43:48] <Mr_Strut> Why are you the way that you are?
[4:43:53] <%lewdskeletor13> @mr_slaide they are entirely corrupt, there leader is an invalid who brainwashes less educated people into doing his dirty work
[4:43:58] <+RioGascar> @angriestpat what thing are you most excited for in Outer Worlds?
[4:44:05] <%ThePuddingDead> So i guess this begs the question: are energy based weapons in fallout good?
[4:44:08] <mothisamonster> was the special suit the one taht talked to you?
[4:44:09] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Sydin18)
[4:44:11] <FashionSoulz> that free ammo you just sold if you learned to craft
[4:44:12] <%mimikyu92> if you use automatic melee weapons, you are a COWARD
[4:44:15] <Mr_Strut> Ninja build cancelled
[4:44:16] <spicyramengaming> RIP
[4:44:17] <+Cheese_Whizard> I cry everytime
[4:44:18] <%IMDRanged> Does Pat have the Gun Runners Arsenal add-on?
[4:44:24] <%ElNumberoJuan> Cheer 200 I'm high as fuck and thought I was watching AGDQ
[4:44:26] <tealwolf26> think so
[4:44:29] <+mastertwin2> But lance tho
[4:44:29] <ScreamingMeat> Yes
[4:44:30] <mercado94> just punch everything
[4:44:30] <TalisKanju> @IMDRanged Yes he has the add-on
[4:44:36] <spicyramengaming> Stream ruined
[4:44:36] <mr_slaide> The energy weapons are terrible in fallout 4 because of how resistances work.
[4:44:41] <%lewdskeletor13> Is Mustard Mom ok?
[4:44:42] <%mister___doctor> Sell that body sell that body make sure you don't hurt nobody
[4:44:43] <%PlaneWalkerDavid> Pat has all the DLC
[4:44:43] <KeystoneA1> Get the custom action
[4:44:45] <sileo_patronus> Save for anti-mat rifle?
[4:44:50] <mr_slaide> Scopes + silencers are the best.
[4:44:52] <randomp141> @RioGascar He's not excited, because he doesn't want any disappointment so it can only improve in his eyes. That or the fact that it's a proper new 3d fallout.
[4:44:55] <%ReidTheReader> no anti rifle :P
[4:44:56] <%IMDRanged> @TalisKanju Ok. Thanks.
[4:44:57] <dekkitout> lets just agree to disagree that the ncr and legion are the way they are for narrative purposes
[4:44:58] <%Prism_Wing> @elnumberojuan you are, dude.

[4:47:26] <%Raxus_Secundus> Sometimes you have to be a little evil to do the greatest good, or not, I didn't do so well in ethics
[4:47:29] <%OwlLightningMage> The best thing about Fallout 4 is the Manbeast mod LUL
[4:47:29] <alrobot2014> legion ambush at the gas station
[4:47:30] <mothisamonster> god boon is such a good companion
[4:47:32] <tealwolf26> Shoot all the fiends
[4:47:32] <%lewdskeletor13> IM FROM A RIVAL GANG apatWhat
[4:47:33] <%mister___doctor> "Oh hold on let me just check my morality" *Looks at phone* "Aw man I'm still evil."
[4:47:34] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> like 2
[4:47:35] <Clu_Flynn> 5 feet of pure evil
[4:47:36] <KoyaMusa> just murder fiends pat
[4:47:36] <lovemepoo> I just discovered a substance without mass. I was like 0mg!
[4:47:36] <Etherealizer> dangit pat you've got me modding new vegas again, my addiction restored
[4:47:36] <mr_slaide> Pat can't believe it's not butter?
[4:47:38] <deviljhojho94> You should get posivite karma
[4:47:39] <+RioGascar> Is there a mod to remove targetting allies
[4:47:39] <%DONGWAVE> UNiQUE HUNTING RIFLE AT NOVAC
[4:47:41] <Mr_Strut> You do though
[4:47:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> a SNEAKY SURPRISE ATTACK AT THE START OF THE ROUND
[4:47:43] <%ElenaManetta> I thought you used to.
[4:47:44] <dukenux> kill fiends then
[4:47:46] <%mimikyu92> it would be literally impossible to be evil otherwise
[4:47:47] <ReapandKnow> karma doesn't matter here
[4:47:49] <+Cheese_Whizard> Because they're the heros Obvi/s
[4:47:53] <Kataguro> Give Fiends the drugs or they'll go BANG
[4:47:58] <%IMDRanged> Use melee on those things
[4:47:59] <tealwolf26> bloatflies are a waste of ammo and gun con
[4:48:01] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @ThePuddingDead you can actually find Bright followers with energy weapons on them around sloan and Nipton; those are the earliest you can get your hands on energy weps until REPCONN or so
[4:48:02] <%lewdskeletor13> No killing rapists and slavers is BAd apatWhat
[4:48:04] <dukenux> OH
[4:48:05] <ScreamingMeat> FIENDS GIVE GOOD KARMA
[4:48:05] <spicyramengaming> Faction rep is the main factor here
[4:48:06] <ReapandKnow> get the red bulls pat
[4:48:12] <%mister___doctor> There are people who honest to God think all the factions in this game are morally grey
[4:48:16] <dukenux> theres guitarbman nearby
[4:48:19] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Same reason you don't get Karma for shooting B.O.S. Doesn't matter how sick and weird their culture is, not aloud to kill them.
[4:48:19] <dekkitout> because youre supposed to be ~torn between two factions that are ideologically deep~ ResidentSleeper
[4:48:21] <Gorgen> isnt Guitar guy near here
[4:48:27] <%nanov11> they just ungrateful you are not evil you gave the power to the ppl
[4:48:27] <+patman22897> YOU MISSED THE DOOR
[4:48:28] <%DONGWAVE> UNiQUE HUNTING RIFLE AT NOVAC STORE
[4:48:29] <Mr_Strut> talk to johnny
[4:48:29] <asurite_warrior> If the legion was fighting something worse than itself then I would be more ok with it and be like yeah killing them isnt really the greatest
[4:48:32] <Gruhunchously> Don't forget to say hi to Sonny Stranger
[4:48:32] <$grimpokemon> That would make too much sense
[4:48:32] <CuttleCrow> don't go inside or anything
[4:48:33] <%Ragnarok_Flames> go get Paciencia from Novac
[4:48:35] <dukenux> and he can give younunique revolver with barter
[4:48:36] <FracturedImage> wheres the guitar man?
[4:48:39] <%ThePuddingDead> @DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap huh...I know precious little of fallout games, never really found the appeal but I see why fans fuggin LOVE it
[4:48:42] <mr_slaide> You got the sjw's for the NCR and the pragmatic people for the Legion.
[4:48:43] <KlausTheKraut> @DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap There's a laser pistol in Doc Mitchell's house though
[4:48:43] <tealwolf26> guitar man
[4:48:43] <%Chichen> Welcome back Pat, can't wait for Podcast tomorrow :)
[4:48:44] <alrobot2014> guitar man is further up the road
[4:48:44] <DefectoRoboto> go inside the station
[4:48:46] <+SimplesRock> I remember playing New Vegas before going to real Vegas, and when I went when I was older, I had that “I’ve been here before” feeling as we drove through the desert. Damn
[4:48:49] <alrobot2014> next to a billboard
[4:48:50] <dukenux> near that road advert
[4:48:55] <+TheBeastman1122> Pat the RE run is starting on gdq followed by silent hill 2
[4:48:56] <dukenux> yeah
[4:48:58] <spicyramengaming> Bloatfly
[4:48:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> wew
[4:49:00] <ReapandKnow> suck it ants, bow before your new god of PAT
[4:49:00] <%mister___doctor> "Ceaser may pillage villages and enslave women but he said some smart stuff at me so I guess he's cool."
[4:49:01] <$Niney_Who> "bullet drop"
[4:49:04] <+RushUnplugged> don't wake up the legion apologists, they'll put you to sleep with their "murder raper slavery and cannibalism are not evil" rethoric
[4:49:07] <blizard_117> The reason the Legion is so undoubtedly evil is because Bethesda rushed the release date so Obsidian couldn't get the Productivity Bonus based on the scores the game was gonna get
[4:49:09] <%IMDRanged> Windage
[4:49:11] <tealwolf26> i dislike bullet drop cuz i'm a scrub
[4:49:13] <%mimikyu92> Imagine having bullet drop
[4:49:14] <blizard_117> TL;DR Bethesda are a bunch of cunts
[4:49:14] <%TheSpiritof2277> Go get the unique magnum from Johnny Guitar up here
[4:49:16] <%knoxxsgold> Like yeah, the NCR is corrupt, but the fucking Legion has slaves, and kills people violently with a lottery
[4:49:17] <%DONGWAVE> UNiQUE HUNTING RIFLE AT NOVAC STORE!
[4:49:18] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @KlausTheKraut Oh yeah, that too. Plus you can get a submachine gun if you got decent repair
[4:49:20] <%Gatzarlok> Aww yeah, get the guitar pistol.
[4:49:25] <mr_slaide> The game could have used more Legion content.
[4:49:26] <ReapandKnow> juicy
[4:49:30] <%pectusumbra> alright, it's quite late, time to sleep. good night
[4:49:30] <%mimikyu92> ~This post was brought to you by the Energy Weapons gnag
[4:49:31] <%OwlLightningMage> The Legion are heroes if you really think about it LUL
[4:49:34] <%Shady_Zaku> Read chat Pat
[4:49:35] <Kataguro> Would bugs even understand the concept of being shot at?
[4:49:38] <StalwartZephyr> Not sure if New Vegas has bullet drop, but it DOES have deviation depending on your gun skill
[4:49:39] <dekkitout> hey lets pattern ourselves after a long dead civilization as opposed to the more recent one, thatll show em
[4:49:41] <bogan1998> get super crit gun from novac
[4:49:45] <%OwlLightningMage> Lawful good that Legion LUL
[4:49:45] <dukenux> Lannius did nothing wrong
[4:49:52] <tealwolf26> yea there's a mod to add more legion content. it's needed
[4:49:56] <ReapandKnow> send the robot to do all the hard work I see
[4:49:59] <randomp141> Legion are just low tech B.O.S. no more heroes than villains.
[4:50:04] <+BishopBain> I love New Vegas, I think it's the best Fallout game, I hate fighting giant ants. Fighting giant bugs is lame.
[4:50:13] <+RushUnplugged> @mimikyu92 the bangbang'ers don't get how pewpewpew is superior
[4:50:13] <%finaltrinity5> why is pat very evil
[4:50:16] <+Johnsonunit> @tealwolf26 Whats the mob called?
[4:50:18] <%DONGWAVE> UNiQUE HUNTING RIFLE AT NOVAC STORE!
[4:50:18] <Gorgen> EDF
[4:50:19] <jonathandemel> Why is Pat killing ants?
[4:50:21] <%TheSpiritof2277> Lannius actually culled the legions numbers when you think about how he pits them against each other
[4:50:22] <randomp141> @finaltrinity5 Because it's Pat.

[4:50:57] <LunarLancaster> Pat the Coward stole my scraps
[4:50:57] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @ThePuddingDead I love it when games with different character builds accommodate all the playstyles at the start so not one build is screwed.
[4:50:59] <%lewdskeletor13> I wish the two main factions were more morally grey. It’s basically post apocalyptic America vs Slavers
[4:51:02] <ScreamingMeat> Killing Fiends gives you Good Karma because they are a bunch of drugged up fuck heads
[4:51:02] <+RushUnplugged> Man wipes out ants, levels up

[4:51:38] <Gruhunchously> It's the Modoc theme. I love it so much. So relaxing.
[4:51:39] <Estuko> wait what's jerryrigging?
[4:51:42] <Beefchief33> Could always Cheat
[4:51:47] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat If you're going to do the Old World Blues DLC then start grabbing lots of Wonderglue and Pre-War Books. You can turn them into skill books in OWB.
[4:51:54] <CuttleCrow> get this man a deans electronics book, stat
[4:51:54] <Etherealizer> There's one in Sloan
[4:51:54] <%maskedriderhero> What if the guys who made The Raid made a God Hand movie
[4:51:58] <blizard_117> Friendly Reminder: The lack of quests coming from the Legion is because Bethesda rushed the release date of the game as to not pay Obsidian their bonus in case the game got really good ratings
[4:52:00] <Kiraklene> @Estuko fixing weapons with similar ones
[4:52:01] <spicyramengaming> @angriestpat Jury Rigging isn't needed until you start getting a ton of uncommon weapons
[4:52:02] <KoyaMusa> you've read one of dean's electronics
[4:52:03] <mothisamonster> jury rig is so busted
[4:52:03] <%ElenaManetta> Tumblr's Today: It's fucked because no more porn!
[4:52:04] <%LtThunderbolt> Jurry rigging is the best perk
[4:52:09] <+nottheminimum> does pat know he sounds a lot like that two best friends guy?
[4:52:10] <+amazinggamingchannel> magazines boost you by 10, temporarily
[4:52:10] <%Gatzarlok> Of all the games to cheat in, this is by far the easiest.
[4:52:12] <%knoxxsgold> @estuko It allows you to repair guns with similar guns
[4:52:13] <CuttleCrow> too far
[4:52:13] <+timblenaut> AGDQ is doing RE1 and SH2 coming up next
[4:52:14] <Estuko> @Kiraklene holy shit that's really good
[4:52:14] <%IMDRanged> @Estuko Jurry Rigging is ability to repair an item with an almost equality type of item.
[4:52:22] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @ElenaManetta buh dum tss
[4:52:23] <%DONGWAVE> UNiQUE HUNTING RIFLE AT NOVAC STORE! MASSIVE CRITS!
[4:52:25] <%OwlLightningMage> The legion would still be evil as shit regardless.
[4:52:29] <alrobot2014> you have two of the three @AngriestPat
[4:52:29] <KeystoneA1> The only one you haven't gotten is at Nellis
[4:52:39] <ReapandKnow> wind farm then
[4:52:41] <TheTunnelSn8ke> You're very close to the Wind Farm in-game right now
[4:52:45] <+Theophilus567> Pat go to nova not buy a unique hunting rifle
[4:52:46] <Clu_Flynn> lowcoRIP
[4:52:47] <Gruhunchously> Why do we need jury rigging right now anyway?
[4:52:47] <DefectoRoboto> wind farm is closest, but also the most dangerous
[4:52:48] <CuttleCrow> wind farm probably
[4:52:53] <+atin2000> why cant he get to the air force base?
[4:52:53] <CuttleCrow> shit
[4:52:53] <+Theophilus567> Novac*
[4:52:58] <ReapandKnow> shiet
[4:52:58] <+SmoochSpider> He already got wind farm
[4:52:58] <Mr_Strut> Jury rigging cancelled!
[4:52:59] <Gruhunchously> You can't even get a perk at this level.
[4:53:00] <%ThePuddingDead> speech maybe?
[4:53:00] <mr_slaide> Get sneak to 35.
[4:53:01] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Cheat you coward
[4:53:01] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> I mean there's always level 16
[4:53:01] <%DONGWAVE> UNiQUE HUNTING RIFLE AT NOVAC STORE! MASSIVE CRITS!
[4:53:02] <%LtThunderbolt> WHAT
[4:53:05] <spicyramengaming> Still should put the points in Repair tho
[4:53:05] <slothslayer828> Novac
[4:53:07] <%ThePuddingDead> i dunno
[4:53:11] <+amazinggamingchannel> enslaving people is awful; but Caesar is pretty right that individualism is probably not sustainable in the wastes
[4:53:12] <+AtlasMcCoy> CHEAT
[4:53:14] <Etherealizer> What about the one at the beginning of Lonesome Road?
[4:53:15] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Well, time to go serpentine to the Boomers.
[4:53:16] <Kataguro> Not like you have to get it at 14. Just pump it some
[4:53:16] <bogan1998> cheat
[4:53:17] <ReapandKnow> just get it next level then
[4:53:19] <%crimsonharvest> well dont give up on it nerd
[4:53:22] <$Piemono> What does jerry-rigging do?
[4:53:22] <%Nobrev> I don't think you get a perk this level @AngriestPat
[4:53:23] <mothisamonster> playthrough overrrr
[4:53:23] <jonathandemel> Perks every second level though?
[4:53:23] <randomp141> CHEAT
[4:53:23] <+nocko_> GUN GO UP
[4:53:26] <alrobot2014> he got it when he was styling on those cazadors
[4:53:27] <+amazinggamingchannel> not even being edgy, it's just probably true
[4:53:28] <+Cheese_Whizard> CHEAT
[4:53:28] <KoyaMusa> time to go the boomers then
[4:53:30] <mr_slaide> Sneak or survival, whichever was needed for the perk.
[4:53:32] <%DONGWAVE> UNiQUE HUNTING RIFLE AT NOVAC STORE! MASSIVE CRITS!
[4:53:35] <%Big_Dream> cheat
[4:53:35] <mr_slaide> Requires 35.
[4:53:39] <Mr_Strut> Just go to nellis.
[4:53:43] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Cheat to add the perk.
[4:53:44] <Mr_Strut> What's the problem?
[4:53:44] <dekkitout> id be willing to eat my own words if there was enough time in the multiverse to make the legions slaving and cultural homogenizing justified
[4:53:52] <CuttleCrow> its still an investment
[4:53:52] <tealwolf26> you can be big empire man without slavery. legion can suck it
[4:53:53] <mr_slaide> It is useful.
[4:53:53] <Kataguro> There you go
[4:53:56] <dukenux> and mass rape
[4:53:57] <%lewdskeletor13> “Enslaving people is awful, but...” no you can stop right there actually. It’s just awful
[4:53:57] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat you can't afford it
[4:54:01] <Gruhunchously> I dunno, I think this Genghis Khan guy has some had a pretty good track record so far. I think we should listen to him.
[4:54:05] <%mimikyu92> my main problem with the legion is how they hack people to death with cleavers
[4:54:06] <%DONGWAVE> IT HAS THE SAME CRiT RATE AS THE ANTI MATERIAL RIFLE
[4:54:09] <%LtThunderbolt> its literary the best perk dude
[4:54:10] <bashful_bard> Why the fuck do you keep spamming weapon recommendations
[4:54:13] <+Cheese_Whizard> Use console to lower a stat by 3 and raise repair by 3, equivalent exchange
[4:54:24] <%nanov11> yeah you gonna get a level at somepoint anyways
[4:54:24] <%OwlLightningMage> The legion are actually the heroes of the story LUL
[4:54:24] <+SmoochSpider> Put it into repair anyway. You don’t get the perk til 14
[4:54:24] <Sokumotanaka> that sucks cause jury rigging would be super useful during dead money with its finite resources.
[4:54:25] <Estuko> LUL who's trying to justify legion
[4:54:28] <dukenux> and crucifixion because "lol while in rome"
[4:54:32] <CuttleCrow> yeah..for you LUL
[4:54:34] <%AncelDeLambert> he is really overthinking this
[4:54:37] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Nothing the legion could be doing makes up for everything else they do
[4:54:40] <%Disname23> Entire point of the Legion is how much you trust in Hegel, it's a big gamble with literally no short term benefits
[4:54:41] <DeepGrave> Everything into repair
[4:54:43] <tealwolf26> Caesar is big fanboi
[4:54:49] <%bigirontarkus> Dongwave is really pushing that gun for Summerslam
[4:54:52] <segychan> TIME TO CHEAT
[4:54:54] <+cerberuscarmine> everything into barter
[4:54:55] <%LtThunderbolt> repair at 80
[4:54:56] <KoyaMusa> why won't you go to nellis?
[4:54:57] <%Raxus_Secundus> @AncelDeLambert It's Pat, when does he not overthink?
[4:54:58] <CuttleCrow> Time to edit the save!!
[4:55:00] <+Cheese_Whizard> Big Cheat
[4:55:01] <blizard_117> I'm so glad Fallout 76% off bombed so hard, bethesda has been such a shitty company for a while with their lack of innovation, specially based around Gamebryo engine and their lazyness of releasing actual unfinished games in the hopes that the modding community will fix the games for them
[4:55:06] <sirrice77> @disname23
[4:55:08] <+Cheese_Whizard> ~~~~~~~
[4:55:08] <%mimikyu92> just put it in repair ffs
[4:55:08] <InkyDraconian> is there a way to respec your character
[4:55:09] <Clu_Flynn> the Legion's imperialistix nonsense is unsustainable chat, all empires fall because empires are retarded bldfSHRUG
[4:55:09] <holsety5> why would you ever not take jury rigging though
[4:55:12] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Any other perks that you've already unlocked before 14?
[4:55:14] <Etherealizer> @AngriestPat get the book from the Wind Farm its right across from Gibsons
[4:55:16] <%Big_Dream> cheat pat we won't care
[4:55:17] <%knoxxsgold> Just make repair kits
[4:55:19] <+Cheese_Whizard> ~
[4:55:19] <bogan1998> neerds
[4:55:21] <+amazinggamingchannel> nobody is trying to justify the legion, but Caesar's philosophy is interesting, the whole anti-individual thing
[4:55:21] <%lewdskeletor13> The Legion falls apart if Caesar dies. That just shows what a shitty cult of personality they actually are
[4:55:22] <CuttleCrow> Edit the save Pat, you know you want to
[4:55:32] <Sokumotanaka> @inkydraconian yeah start over
[4:55:33] <%OwlLightningMage> The Legion and Griffith did nothing wrong LUL
[4:55:34] <sirrice77> @Disname23
[4:55:35] <+SmoochSpider> He already got the wind farm book @etherealizer
[4:55:36] <tealwolf26> isn't that just communism then?
[4:55:38] <%IMDRanged> Cowboy Perk I find not too bad
[4:55:42] <%Gatzarlok> Your intro literally quotes you as saying "Gotta cheat" Just cheat man, it's what we expect of you
[4:55:46] <Etherealizer> @SmoochSpider both it and sloan?
[4:55:50] <KoyaMusa> @AngriestPat why won't you go to nellis?
[4:55:51] <mr_slaide> Requires a LOT of medicine.
[4:55:51] <%Nedlin> !uptime
[4:55:51] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 55m.
[4:55:51] <+SmoochSpider> Yeah
[4:55:52] <spicyramengaming> Principality of Zeon did nothing wrong
[4:55:55] <%Ragnarok_Flames> Bloody Mess?
[4:55:58] <Clu_Flynn> the Legion is just as doomed as Rome was for allowing barbarias to mix with them and just as the US now bldfSHRUG
[4:55:58] <+Cheese_Whizard> It's just one button pat ~
[4:55:59] <+SmoochSpider> The only one he doesn’t have is Nellis
[4:55:59] <sirrice77> Well chat on ps4 twitch sucks
[4:56:05] <dukenux> except Ceasar himself whos the big individual cult of personality figure
[4:56:05] <tealwolf26> also yes leader cults are big unsustainable which is why empires suck
[4:56:07] <Etherealizer> @SmoochSpider ah, rip
[4:56:12] <%IMDRanged> Just pull up the ~ Console Command and just raise your Repair skill to a hundred, Pat
[4:56:13] <+amazinggamingchannel> @tealwolf26 yeah, oligarchical communism, with a dictator too
[4:56:13] <Kataguro> At least put like 2 points in Repair
[4:56:14] <ArcticAsylum> Adamantium Skeleton is better
[4:56:15] <%mister___doctor> Pat I never spend more than 3 minutes on this screen
[4:56:17] <dukenux> basucly
[4:56:17] <Etherealizer> @SmoochSpider thought he said he only had sloan, my bad lol
[4:56:20] <Gruhunchously> Yeah, the Legion's anti-individualism is part of it's undoing, because everyone in it is taught to revere Caesar. So when he dies, there's no one to take his place.
[4:56:22] <CuttleCrow> put soooome points in repair
[4:56:24] <%mimikyu92> why has pat spent half an hour on a levelup that doesnt even have a perk
[4:56:24] <%Ragnarok_Flames> Clu stop being racist
[4:56:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 70 med 80 sci
[4:56:28] <%Idziman> @Clu_Flynn fuck off with that racist shit
[4:56:29] <lotharrio> Ghouls and humans are pretty common enemies... but you won't really need the extra damage.
[4:56:34] <Mr_Strut> Jury rigging cancelled. Time to restart.
[4:56:36] <%lewdskeletor13> @amazinggamingchannel Caesar is literally just a cult leader. He couldn’t survive on his own so he brainwashed less educated people to his dirty work. The Legion falls apart without his leadership, showing how weak his philosophy really was
[4:56:37] <ArcticAsylum> 50% less Limb damage
[4:56:38] <dukenux> the day ceasaer dies this whole thing will collapse into civil war
[4:56:39] <+amazinggamingchannel> @Gruhunchously the game teaches that lesson about cults really well.
[4:56:40] <mr_slaide> Don't give up, skeleton!
[4:56:42] <lloyddboy> BIG HARD SKELTON
[4:56:47] <%LtThunderbolt> high defense is my way of playing for some reason
[4:56:51] <Gruhunchously> Or you could just stop stepping on mines.
[4:56:52] <+Cheese_Whizard> Being a huge cripple?
[4:56:57] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Limbs getting crippled so easily? Yep.
[4:56:58] <%Faustgesicht> crazy talk
[4:57:01] <slothslayer828> war never changes
[4:57:05] <+amazinggamingchannel> @lewdskeletor13 he honestly did it for himself, he's so goddamn evil, and so good at it
[4:57:06] <+aivalera> Adamant skel isn’t that hseful though
[4:57:07] <%DONGWAVE> @AngriestPat The Unique Hunting Rifle at the Novac Store has one of the highest critical damages in the entire game.
[4:57:08] <spicyramengaming> @angriestpat This game is pretty easy, I think you might be overthinking a bit LUL
[4:57:09] <Clu_Flynn> oh don't be retarded, history illiterates always go on about race. Totally not the point
[4:57:10] <GodlyLuigi> bandaid the i cant see mines problem
[4:57:10] <CuttleCrow> BIG repair
[4:57:11] <PumaOfDarkness> A terminator on the inside.

[4:57:16] <%Johnothon> I bet Paige is gonna love your thicc ass bones
[4:57:17] <ArcticAsylum> Oh yeah ypu took the beginning perk of extra AGL but more limb damage
[4:57:18] <+aivalera> Use stims
[4:57:21] <$Niney_Who> Repair is just Medicine for guns
[4:57:25] <deviljhojho94> Just kill them all pat
[4:57:26] <Mr_Strut> Now go to nellis
[4:57:27] <%OwlLightningMage> Overthinking is fun
[4:57:34] <CuttleCrow> see if you can at least get into Nellis
[4:57:35] <%Ragnarok_Flames> Clu go fuck yourself
[4:57:37] <deviljhojho94> If you kill your enemies you win
[4:57:37] <mr_slaide> The hypest min-maxing on Twitch.
[4:57:40] <Gruhunchously> Surgery is just stabbing people back to life.
[4:57:41] <ArcticAsylum> Not at all can't reapec in this game so choices matter man
[4:57:41] <mercado94> repair is just a temporary buff if you think about it
[4:57:43] <tacostarvedbeast> Just a tad
[4:57:43] <TheTunnelSn8ke> One of the Vaults is close by from here.
[4:57:45] <anar_bael> Overthinking is how we get fun shit
[4:57:48] <Mr_Strut> Nellis is easy to get to
[4:57:50] <spicyramengaming> Part of the fun of this game is picking goofy perks and doing weird stuff LUL
[4:57:50] <Clu_Flynn> as Lee Kuan Yew said, it's unsustainable
[4:57:51] <%OwlLightningMage> I've spent more time overthinking my Wasteland 2 team rather than playing the game LUL
[4:57:51] <%nanov11> started skyrim again but with money is xp
[4:57:51] <deviljhojho94> right in the ass
[4:57:53] <%lewdskeletor13> @clu_flynn Can you not be rude please?
[4:57:58] <+Cheese_Whizard> @Johnothon Nah Paige HATES it Wants it to be just bones, no extra bits
[4:57:59] <%Gatzarlok> Also you walked right past Guitar man
[4:57:59] <%mimikyu92> @OwlLightningMage just ask the chat's legion discourse
[4:58:02] <Gruhunchously> Overthinking stuff is what RPG nerds do best.
[4:58:03] <coldnoid> sad piano note
[4:58:04] <psiops_cyclops> best build is melee/unarmed
[4:58:07] <%Gatzarlok> Oh yeah... Guitar man!

[4:58:32] <$SGrim> @Clu_Flynn as a Historian, it's actually more likely that Rome's isolationist tendency, coupled with internal instability is what doomed it's western half. The Byzantines were much more open and survived for nearly 1200 years longer. I doubt facts will change your opinions, but I'm happy to share.
[4:58:32] <bogan1998> tan lines

[5:47:11] <%skizzuto> pat is correct
[5:47:12] <+Prinny_Raider> yes
[5:47:12] <Etherealizer> yes its true
[5:47:13] <zamzoph> there was a girl on camera but she wasn't playing
[5:47:13] <%CrimsonCore90> it was hitman
[5:47:13] <%commanderclaw> Pat is right
[5:47:14] <%AncelDeLambert> it's so real
[5:47:14] <%bevyrage> 100% fabricated
[5:47:14] <$SleepyMaribo> you are super right
[5:47:15] <$KnivesEve> think so
[5:47:15] <%mugwugsampoo> Yes
[5:47:16] <$nademonkey1100> yes
[5:47:16] <mercado94> thats crazy bullshit
[5:47:16] <Twoiis> pretty much
[5:47:16] <%OwlLightningMage> Except it's literally not Blizzard's fault. Why would they deflect from a thing they didn't do LUL
[5:47:16] <%Raxus_Secundus> The person was real, but she was not playing overwatch
[5:47:17] <%MachoMadnesss94> it was a PRANK BRO
[5:47:17] <%SweetCheeksTrap> You're super right Pat
[5:47:18] <%TheSpiritof2277> You're totally right
[5:47:18] <CopperTucker> WHAT
[5:47:18] <+PBandJensen> That is exactly what happened, yes
[5:47:18] <+Varnarok> Ellie was a top500 player called Punisher who played while a girl did voiceover over the gameplay
[5:47:18] <%NKOrange> true
[5:47:18] <+subdude_> Correct
[5:47:19] <alrobot2014> pat is not crazy talking
[5:47:19] <%megamonmon123> pat is right
[5:47:20] <vanagandr_hnd> thats insane
[5:47:20] <aeonicvector> Pats right and thats a weird statement
[5:47:20] <mistspade> Pat is right
[5:47:20] <VanLynx> blizzard confirmed
[5:47:21] <Izuurus> vaporgirl
[5:47:21] <JazzFirpo> Magic Amy all over again LUL
[5:47:21] <Etherealizer> Some guy called Punisher
[5:47:21] <%jiin6> Ellie was a "Social Experiment"
[5:47:22] <General_Terro> PRANKED
[5:47:22] <$ooblagis> It's confirmed hard
[5:47:23] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> What the fuck even is this
[5:47:23] <%AncelDeLambert> "social experiment"
[5:47:23] <%Neo_Kaiser> It was one guy under Ellie using two women to voice him.
[5:47:23] <%Disname23> JUST A PRANK
[5:47:23] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> PAT is finally right!
[5:47:24] <zamzoph> """social experiment"""
[5:47:25] <+SuichiTanaka> It was a male player with a female talking
[5:47:25] <DSD24> What is the point?
[5:47:26] <AngryTurt1e> it was a player by the name of punisher
[5:47:26] <%IMDRanged> A SuperbestfriendCast would have cleared that up
[5:47:26] <DefectoRoboto> just a prank bro
[5:47:28] <%SirBearic> yep, it was a pro player who was actually playing
[5:47:28] <NonAddictiveSlurm> like that guy in the Marvel tournament that played as a friend
[5:47:29] <+MechaBaphomet> Being a dickhead
[5:47:31] <$ooblagis> Prank
[5:47:31] <%MachoMadnesss94> prank broooooo
[5:47:32] <%SweetCheeksTrap> """Social Experiment"""
[5:47:33] <+Sinister_Aglet> Lie that went wrong
[5:47:35] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Cheese_Whizard)
[5:47:36] <+VanaSkiller> game journalists would defend the wahmen
[5:47:36] <krymzen5> thats just cover up
[5:47:37] <%Stevennapalm> apatWhat apatWhat apatWhat apatWhat
[5:47:37] <NeroInfinite> Wowie.
[5:47:37] <bleugh> JUST A PRANK BROOO
[5:47:38] <%cherubsanonymous> That game journalists are fuckshit
[5:47:38] <%shen4u> Yep if was the person everyone thought it was playing under the name, punisher
[5:47:39] <%Nobrev> he claimed it was a social experiment because he was getting in deep shit @AngriestPat
[5:47:40] <+usetheboost3d> are you for real, I only scrolled by that one headline. jesus, the whole situation is just fucked
[5:47:41] <+Kravedarknesss> A guy was playing and using the Ellie girl as a cover
[5:47:41] <%OwlLightningMage> A pro player was being an ass and somehow it's Blizzard's fault LUL
[5:47:41] <%TheDude8D> It was just a male North American player
[5:47:41] <%Raxus_Secundus> Experiment was could a girl be accepted as a pro, but she wasn't playing
[5:47:42] <%snorlaxbud> apatBig confused
[5:47:44] <%RaikenTB> Yeah it was fake.
[5:47:45] <+luigintbknss> "social expiriment" right
[5:47:46] <Valask> seriously?
[5:47:46] <%UltraCasualBoom> eSssssspppppooooorrrrrttttssss!
[5:47:49] <PaPaSeppuku> CASTLE SUPER BEAST
[5:47:49] <$nademonkey1100> it was all a lie
[5:47:49] <Vroom0> D: big prank
[5:47:50] <KeystoneA1> Game Journalists calling it a social experiment because they were stupid enough in their ideological zeal to report on it and use it to attack gamers
[5:47:52] <%jiin6> and the people called them out of it
[5:47:53] <%Stevennapalm> "social experiment"
[5:47:54] <+Sinister_Aglet> It was Punisher
[5:47:55] <%MachoMadnesss94> kinda like florida man
[5:47:56] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> Uhoh Paige doesn't understand
[5:47:56] <Twoiis> I think it was just one guy Punisher.
[5:47:56] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat It was a social experiment. A guy hired a 17 year old girl to be the Face and at least one guy was playing as "her"
[5:47:57] <%Shady_Zaku> !uptime
[5:47:58] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 47m.
[5:47:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> game "journalist" bullshit
[5:47:59] <%TheSpiritof2277> I think they literally said something to the effect of it's a 'social experiment'
[5:48:00] <BigNerdSam> It was as much a social experiment as paying South Africans to Nazi salute
[5:48:01] <%Neo_Kaiser> No Pat, 1 guy was in top 500 for so long and he didn't get onto a team until he pretended to be a woman.
[5:48:03] <+Shillk> it was about female overwatch contenders or something
[5:48:04] <JazzFirpo> @AngriestPat the same thing happened in Hearthstone with a player known as "Magic Amy"
[5:48:05] <%IMDRanged> No "real" people
[5:48:05] <+MechaBaphomet> @AngriestPat Not even at the skill level of a pro player either
[5:48:08] <+RushUnplugged> gotta prove that them gurlz can't play teh gamez
[5:48:08] <+Varnarok> One explanation for the "experiement" was that if an above average player showed up, they would instantly get signed even if they were a girl
[5:48:10] <%cherubsanonymous> @KeystoneA1 THANK YOU
[5:48:10] <%jiin6> Game Journo's are idiots
[5:48:12] <+Press_X_ToJASON> 2
[5:48:12] <BeefyQueefer> Who's Talking
[5:48:12] <+VanaSkiller> GAME JOURNALISTS that defend the wahmen but it was actually male
[5:48:12] <Izuurus> an actual fake gamer girl
[5:48:15] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> PAIGE never understands
[5:48:18] <a_useless_lamp> So the timelines is fucked now cause Pat is right
[5:48:19] <%Shady_Zaku> Goodnight folks! apatBig sleep gooodnight
[5:48:21] <%ThePuddingDead> it was to put journalists on blast for putting up a "female gamer" on a pedestal and it was completely fake
[5:48:24] <%Bt_Robot> @angriestpat Patthias, tune into AGDQ, they are going to start Silent Hill 2!!
[5:48:27] <Red_Comet_Tyson> it was to get preferencial treatment
[5:48:27] <%RaikenTB> that's funny.
[5:48:27] <Banjoboozle> Blizzard's full of shit and they're just trying to damage control because their stock is dropping fucking fast as shit
[5:48:29] <reonome> FAKE GAMER GRILLS
[5:48:37] <+Kravedarknesss> it kinda does both
[5:48:37] <alrobot2014> are we in the timeline where bam never met tony?
[5:48:42] <%SweetCheeksTrap> @AngriestPat It was someone who wanted to see if they'd be let into the e-sport thing if Blizzard thought they were a girl.
[5:48:44] <Izuurus> esports catfish
[5:48:45] <+usetheboost3d> that's an unfortunate situation all around
[5:48:46] <%rdark_ksu> Did you know women have hands? and can use them for Games???
[5:48:47] <%SweetCheeksTrap> From what I understand
[5:48:50] <%OwlLightningMage> Why would Blizzard deflect from something that wasn't their fault LUL
[5:48:51] <lloyddboy> @AngriestPat remember when snoop dog did the exact same thing
[5:48:52] <%payterodactyl> wait so this came around to soldier 76 being gay? or am i just super lost and came back in at the wrong time?
[5:48:53] <Rentixx> Not a prank or test, just some guy pretending to be a girl who became popular end unintentionally, trolling the overwatch community
[5:48:54] <Estuko> gamer grills < georgeforeman grills
[5:48:56] <$ooblagis> Yeah, because that's the narrative Kotaku went with. There was no harrasment, just calling of bullshit
[5:49:04] <%shen4u> Guy got rejected by the team, then made Ellie and instantly got accepted without vetting
[5:49:05] <%UltraCasualBoom> The biggest shit is Hanzo an annoying fuck
[5:49:07] <%OwlLightningMage> That's not true
[5:49:07] <Rentixx> and*
[5:49:09] <+MechaBaphomet> @AngriestPat He wasnt even good enough to be pro
[5:49:11] <%AncelDeLambert> that's not what it was
[5:49:13] <Valask> this keeps changing
[5:49:16] <NonAddictiveSlurm> e-sports catfishing is a thing now
[5:49:16] <%Secutus> They couldn't get in before
[5:49:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol it worked
[5:49:19] <Valask> please keep going
[5:49:19] <%Ragnarok_Flames> pat you are just enabling gamer Gators
[5:49:20] <%SweetCheeksTrap> OH am I super wrong?
[5:49:20] <reonome> he didn't get accepted into the team!!!
[5:49:22] <reonome> no
[5:49:23] <%lewdskeletor13> That’s fucked
[5:49:23] <+Varnarok> No
[5:49:23] <+sundizzle> that's not true
[5:49:24] <%IMDRanged> Wait that was it?
[5:49:25] <%AncelDeLambert> the guy just enjoyed griefing
[5:49:25] <+Varnarok> He wasn't rejected
[5:49:27] <$ooblagis> It is
[5:49:27] <%OwlLightningMage> They said it was social experiment
[5:49:28] <%emillionghost> no
[5:49:28] <%Cavumentum> @AngriestPat She was 3 gamecubes stacked on top of each other inside a trenchcoat
[5:49:31] <%ThePuddingDead> its fuckin funny as hell
[5:49:32] <%SweetCheeksTrap> I DON'T FUCKING KNOW
[5:49:32] <zamzoph> guy doesn't play OW good enough to get into esports team, but he's considered good enough if he's a girl
[5:49:32] <%mostundesired> Supposedly
[5:49:33] <%Raxus_Secundus> The account made to the top levels in NA
[5:49:35] <bleugh> lol esports catfishing
[5:49:38] <KahtaLzargo> Guess I made it in time to catch the end. That’s fine since AGDQ has been fun.
[5:49:39] <%snorlaxbud> research time
[5:49:40] <+usetheboost3d> SHOW YOUR WORK
[5:49:42] <xeros720> sounds fresh enough that the story is a damn mess
[5:49:42] <SchroedingersFerret> Ellie is a reptilian humanoid
[5:49:42] <%ingobernable34> I mean abuse hurled at her DOES highlight fucked up attitudes towards women entering gaming communities.
[5:49:44] <Zola390> Wouldn't doubt that.
[5:49:46] <shinobi62676> Pat! You ever talk about Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate on Switch on the podcast or play it on stream?
[5:49:49] <%mostundesired> LUL
[5:49:50] <reonome> he got found out before he actually got into the league
[5:49:55] <KruelDestiny> PogChamp 3 whole gamecubes
[5:49:55] <SuiZideD> LUL
[5:49:56] <%InsaneJackLondon> those sneeky cubes
[5:49:57] <%rdark_ksu> man some ppl are in so much trouble for this kinda shit. I love looking into this nonsense
[5:49:57] <%ingobernable34> It just also highlights a lame double standard
[5:49:58] <%Raxus_Secundus> Which is how Ellie got noticed as it happened so quickly
[5:50:00] <aeonicvector> 3 Gamecubes AND a N-Gage, get your info right
[5:50:03] <$Hiro01231> You could never defeat her then
[5:50:06] <Banjoboozle> @AngriestPat Did you see that thing about a Melee player finding out that a a baby's fisherprice is really good for Melee
[5:50:08] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat The Ellie "girl" had no social media presence, no streams, little play time and was accepted.
[5:50:11] <+sundizzle> they were talking about SBFP and it made me sad all over again
[5:50:11] <Estuko> @ingobernable34 it can be gross, a lot of people are nice. But when it's bad it's always garbage fire bad
[5:50:11] <%Agami23> made out of nintendium
[5:50:16] <%OwlLightningMage> 3 gameboys just to piss Pat off LUL
[5:50:22] <+Doctor_Stew> So the question is, was he good enough but they wanted a lady on the team or was he bad and they just wanted a lady on the team?
[5:50:22] <Banjoboozle> baby's fisherprice controller*

[6:12:50] <Master_Pancakes> ou know they say that all men are created equal, but you look at me and you look at Samoa Joe and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you go one on one with another wrestler, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak and I'm not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat me. Then you add Kurt Angle to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down. See the 3 way at Sacrifice, you got a 33 1/3 chance of winning, but I, I got a 66 and 2/3 chance of winning,
[6:12:51] <+Kilik_> @AngriestPat would you be interested in watching a clip of a man dropping 1000 Dinky the T-Rex toys individually in his Novac room?
