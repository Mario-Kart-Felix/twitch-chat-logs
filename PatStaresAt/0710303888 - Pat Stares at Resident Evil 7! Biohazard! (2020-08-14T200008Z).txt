[0:37:07] <aeronauticaljon> Pro tip: puppies have to go constantly. Every 3-4 hours let them out (if they have the shots) treat and praise if duty (lol) was done. If wetting happens at night a lot, think of a crate. One that space but not too much to encourage peeing in the corner. And don't get a kennel, they are too confining. The wire crate feels more open plus more room for blankets.

[0:41:32] <%TigerCatGo> Wait, why you playing RE7 again, @PatStaresAt ? New updates? Just curious
[0:41:33] <mattrutland> Thats an accurate face description pat, sounds just like my ex....
[0:41:33] <DrkJP520> Let Paige do the shadow puzzles for old times' sake.
[0:41:34] <BlkFlameKami> "evil"
[0:41:35] <+xeros720> you think ethan is talking to chris right now?
[0:41:36] <%DensityD> How does Ethan just 'KNOW' about the healing juice?
[0:41:37] <anAngryHamster> That sounds racist out of context
[0:41:37] <MartwyPies> Look at this fucking True Detective shit
[0:41:37] <Talfri> I would say some of Ethan's weirdness could just be down to his writing lol
[0:41:37] <%briktal> just a prank
[0:41:38] <cerellium> wouldn't you ignore if Paige was an evil secret agent? for...love?
[0:41:38] <KaiserMario> True Detective
[0:41:39] <%kelkellington> they're both fucked
[0:41:40] <%Movemeister> BACK IN POG FORM
[0:41:40] <+BIumen> is it?
[0:41:42] <+ricluvno304> Ethan is definitely tough as nails.
[0:41:44] <rytisone> Mystery is part of the charm in a horrror game
[0:41:45] <$RealThiele> she just goes on business trips all the time durr
[0:41:46] <+evbites> i assume he was generic clerk man
[0:41:46] <%Agami23> the fact that he said "maybe dont take that job" to mia is really weird
[0:41:46] <psimon_> are we in the deadly premonition area?N
[0:41:47] <skyentombment> WELCUM TO THE FEMLY SON
[0:41:47] <FlashFrame> I'm not sure how deep they thought into that, it feels kinda like they just wanted to ape Silent Hill
[0:41:47] <smuggleruncle> Mia... Could you really be in this town
[0:41:48] <%thesyndrome> is that part live-action?
[0:41:48] <+The_Butterfly_Man> my bet he is linked to umbrella some how like a distant relative to the founders
[0:41:48] <marvel877> You mean like how Ethan doesn't have much of a character, unless that's all in the manual or something?
[0:41:50] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> like raiden and rosemary from MGS
[0:41:51] <derap41> Its animateed
[0:41:51] <%lutefiiisk> This isn't live action, Pat. It's real
[0:41:51] <0rond> why is pat playing this now?
[0:41:53] <Kuj999> He’s a simp
[0:41:53] <bluefooddye1> The DEEP south
[0:41:56] <0rond> pat it's been 3 years
[0:41:57] <+xeros720> ethan being part of BSAA/nu umbrella seems to make sense to me
[0:41:59] <Meowtch> Have you seen the theory that Ethan is an Umbrella scientist?
[0:42:00] <0rond> why are you playing it
[0:42:03] <+lethallylactic> DEEP SOUTH
[0:42:04] <ninjaguiden> DEEEP
[0:42:04] <%TigerCatGo> DEEP SOUTH
[0:42:05] <%Niney_Who> Ah yes Zach, the Deep South
[0:42:05] <%nmaten> you hear that zach?
[0:42:06] <%Jaysky> The DEEP SOUTH
[0:42:06] <%Stuzilla21> Stuzilla21 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[0:42:06] <%ToneBacas> the deepest south
[0:42:07] <BallerSwagBro9k> DEEP SOUTH
[0:42:07] <misterspotswood> i forget, does it say he doesnt know shes a scientist experiment lady?
[0:42:09] <+RowenCleric> D E E P S O U T H
[0:42:10] <ChoculaUltra> isn't this one of those journeys that you would definitely want to bring a friend or 2 with you? Ethan confirmed for not having any friends.
[0:42:10] <%barrakuta371> THE LOOOORD HUNGERS!
[0:42:11] <%0nl00kr> man I fucking love this game
[0:42:11] <%kyh9> Yes, this incest is truly indicative of the Deep South
[0:42:12] <Guardiansaiyan> ISN'T that right ZACH?!
[0:42:12] <MartwyPies> Remember Bray Wyatt? That was neat
[0:42:12] <ClutchRoadagain> Down in that Bible Belt

[0:42:13] <%Joustar_> D E E P
[0:42:13] <%CorpulentToad> THE LOOOOORD HUNGERS
[0:42:13] <Lutre> Joe Baker should've been the new main character, let me punch out more moldmen
[0:42:13] <%UvBenServed> When does Ethan get a skateboard?
[0:42:13] <Ookamiden02> DEEP SALT
[0:42:14] <$RealThiele> texas chainsaw shit
[0:42:14] <indig0bird> Oh, you're going to discuss the Ethan = Umbrella employee theory?
[0:42:14] <+tacostarvedbeast> pat you havent seen a cube in 3 years
[0:42:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> I don't care whether it's RE VIII or REV III, that shit will probably be GREAT
[0:42:14] <%the_mental_punk> How about the fact that His car Is Ash's car from the evil dead
[0:42:15] <%Jaysky> No
[0:42:17] <%blaggablag> DEEEPER SOUTHER
[0:42:17] <alexandrecau> What if it's just no one being normal? like the bakers were freaks before
[0:42:20] <+RyTYoung> D E E P S O U T H
[0:42:20] <%Huntercd> Mia's pussy must be good to bring Ethan all the way out here
[0:42:20] <Guardiansaiyan> HOUGAN
[0:42:20] <%medusasghost> good to be back in the deep south zach
[0:42:22] <shazbot2020> The dumbest thing about Ethan is how he just dead serious asks for a cop's gun like it's the most normal thing in the world.
[0:42:23] <BallerSwagBro9k> Man DP2 was a masterpiece
[0:42:23] <rat_boy1996> "wah ha ha ha ha"
[0:42:23] <0rond> truly is the DEEP SOUTH

[0:43:03] <%thesyndrome> @PatStaresAt do you still have any of the NG+ unlocks in this version of the game?
[0:43:04] <Talfri> don't even call the police
[0:43:04] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Can you feel it the deep south
[0:43:04] <JayEarly> foil age
[0:43:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> Ooh, my gross eyeball got extra gross at some point
[0:43:06] <%Shockrates20XX> Is Pat or Paige playing?
[0:43:07] <+Arkfyre> @Gallhint it's foilage, lisa
[0:43:07] <%CorpulentToad> DP2 was the shittiest masterpiece I've ever seen. I love it.
[0:43:07] <+raypoint_223> @PatStaresAt I figure eathn after the events of re7 would get involved some in dealing with bio weapons like claire and all
[0:43:07] <%kelkellington> welcome to the family, zach
[0:43:08] <$RealThiele> not Mia, just a new wife
[0:43:08] <Kalcom> kill wife
[0:43:09] <transporterthesequel> Wait so you’re NOT an FFXIV STRIMMER?!
[0:43:11] <SpaceGuntank> Pat are you going to do the whole thing again and the DLC or is this a one off?
[0:43:13] <@PlagueOfGripes> I don't know
[0:43:13] <%0nl00kr> I think I got down to like 2 and a half hours attempting to speedrun this
[0:43:14] <Sapphire_Breeze> nah it's just the south
[0:43:14] <cipher758> it's fine
[0:43:15] <cerellium> thats racist
[0:43:16] <+xeros720> yeah, it's a plantation, it's evil by default
[0:43:17] <SMuffinMan> Sure does
[0:43:17] <neraren> foilage
[0:43:17] <Mr_Strut> It's probably just a drug den
[0:43:17] <derap41> Post slave manor
[0:43:18] <trulythedude> up that brightness please
[0:43:18] <cyclog> Didn't Resident Evil 1 have a mansion that was in a dense forest like this one ?
[0:43:18] <BettyMwwaahh> thats just how the south is
[0:43:19] <Coystick> Why don't you ask the Residents?
[0:43:20] <%Valdorick> Nah, its just a normal mansion.
[0:43:20] <rbakervv> why is the stream so fucking dark!
[0:43:21] <Darren716> Honestly pre infection the Baker house is nice
[0:43:22] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt All this work to find Mia, only for Chris to shoot her in the head later...
[0:43:22] <%the_mental_punk> I'm suprised there was no slave plantation angle to it
[0:43:22] <julrave> we're here Zac the DEEP SOUTH
[0:43:23] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> I expect you to play Classic RE2 more then anyother RE Games
[0:43:23] <TheCoolestRyker> It was probably a slave manor if it's in Louisiana
[0:43:23] <dan_g_v> the residence is not evil
[0:43:24] <pmk4609> an evil residence
[0:43:24] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I would expect to find some Civil War artifacts in there
[0:43:24] <%Agami23> it looks evil, but its not unusual
[0:43:24] <%AngelCrossroads> im from the deep south. this is very accurate
[0:43:25] <+tacostarvedbeast> you have clearly never been to a wafflehouse
[0:43:26] <%blaggablag> it's because of all the slavery spirits
[0:43:27] <Dr_Mooose> the usual
[0:43:27] <$RealThiele> Sotuhern Hospitality!
[0:43:28] <EuropanLamprey> Nah, this is just the Bayou
[0:43:29] <%ShawnTK_> ive seen worse
[0:43:29] <xanderfist> Pat is Resident Evil Master that's why
[0:43:29] <%medusasghost> i mean the deep south has plenty of evil manors
[0:43:30] <bookofmouths> the troubles?
[0:43:31] <MartwyPies> In deep south those are the good manors, you dont want to see the evil south manors
[0:43:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> Very BioCursed
[0:43:32] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I mean yeah but thats just how the south is
[0:43:32] <%Agami23> stuff in the south just tends to look evil
[0:43:32] <Lutre> this is where Mr Peanut kept the slaves
[0:43:35] <+LastHazzerd> most Manors are evil
[0:43:35] <filialpails> southern manor houses are inherently evil
[0:43:36] <marvel877> Not really. That's what a lot of old plantations look like.
[0:43:37] <+r_Foeburden87> like he would suffer through 6 and not play 7
[0:43:37] <rusho> I think they're confused because this is a pretty linear title, not much replay variability unless you count the bonus weapons/items
[0:43:39] <rbakervv> can't see shit
[0:43:40] <+xeros720> the ghost of racism lurks in the shadows here
[0:43:42] <faithless_zealot> @PatStaresAt Why is it that no protagonist, in any zombie survival game, ever knows how to climb a fence?
[0:43:43] <DeltaPangaea> I have wanted to see the FIST dlc for this game for ages.
[0:43:45] <+LastHazzerd> eat the rich
[0:43:45] <MartwyPies> It's Shinra mansion
[0:43:45] <SMuffinMan> BIG slavery
[0:43:46] <+evbites> no it's normal through slaves were defiantly here
[0:43:49] <%AngelCrossroads> @lutre holy shit
[0:43:49] <%BoneofMalkav> I donno Pat, You should probably ask the Residence of the nearest town how Evil this mansion is? LUL
[0:43:49] <%realm_forge> Well the Deep South is basically evil so that’s right on the money
[0:43:49] <julrave> okay but how well would York do in RE7?
[0:43:50] <%Niney_Who> Not really
[0:43:52] <%critiquequartz> Is he playing in be?
[0:43:52] <%xcompleasedad> Yes!
[0:43:53] <%thesyndrome> "whelp, no one answered, time to break and enter!!"
[0:43:57] <%blaggablag> evil kinda comes with the house deed, sorry
[0:43:57] <$RealThiele> yea theres likely a slave skeleton on this land
[0:43:58] <FlashFrame> there are some areas in the "Deep south" that are on ACRES of land.
[0:43:58] <derap41> Slave owners Manor Pat
[0:43:59] <Mr_Strut> Old plantations usually
[0:43:59] <%Niney_Who> If you buy a Plantation property you get like hundreds of Acres
[0:43:59] <cerellium> pat you just arent an arteest
[0:43:59] <rytisone> D.r House
[0:44:00] <%blaggablag> NO REFUNDS
[0:44:02] <%walternatorz> things like home maintenance is hard to do when you no longer have free help
[0:44:03] <SMuffinMan> Slavery Pat
[0:44:03] <+tacostarvedbeast> well the south has a lot of land
[0:44:04] <%xcompleasedad> They are very successful ranchers....... apparently
[0:44:04] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @PatStaresAt Swamps are inherently evil- this is a proven scientific fact
[0:44:05] <%ragingbrachy> eyah
[0:44:05] <%critiquequartz> VR?
[0:44:07] <%TigerCatGo> TOO MUCH HOUSE
[0:44:08] <%thepizzascotsman> is the game really dark for anyone else??
[0:44:09] <marvel877> House....M.D.?
[0:44:09] <Badgerconda_> not for a culty southern family
[0:44:10] <abakkus> plantations are like that
[0:44:11] <%Excel83> it is much house
[0:44:12] <%weissguard> It's a nice estate, sure.
[0:44:12] <DantesAnimus> this is weird timing for this stream because I literally just replayed this myself outta the blue last week lol I missed good ol Jack.
[0:44:13] <%Solarint> yeah this foliage looks photoreal as someone who lives in the south
[0:44:14] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @PatStaresAt you shouldnt be judgemental of other peoples homes, thats isnt very good manors
[0:44:15] <+The_Butterfly_Man> well property aint that expensive
[0:44:15] <%ClutchRoadagain> YOU'RE a lot of house
[0:44:15] <rat_boy1996> should we investigate it, zach?
[0:44:16] <ha2ken> Could be a question for Eli
[0:44:17] <%BestTeaMaker> @PatStaresAt are you planning on doing the dlc too?
[0:44:17] <%Taisuru> When you're in the middle of nowhere you can have as much house as you want
[0:44:18] <%kyh9> It's pretty normal in the rural areas of the country to have big houses
[0:44:18] <+pynkdoe> i mean the inside of the house looked fine during the prequel scenarios
[0:44:19] <$RealThiele> not if you got slaves
[0:44:19] <clockworknait1> There is a slave plantation angle kinda. shes turning people into gooey black slaves
[0:44:20] <aeronauticaljon> Is it super dark for anyone else?
[0:44:20] <%briktal> houses are cheap in the middle of nowhere
[0:44:20] <+Skelex> did the game ever explain why this whole house is on the baker's property, but they lived in a little shack house?
[0:44:22] <%blaggablag> many much house lots
[0:44:22] <alexandrecau> rich bayou guys have quantity pat
[0:44:22] <marvel877> Well, it probably was a PLANTATION...
[0:44:23] <%SpaghettiTime44> Is his AC still broken?
[0:44:25] <%ogtrashwizard> The stream is a bit dark Pat
[0:44:28] <thetruenicster> is it just me, or is it darker than usual?
[0:44:30] <MartwyPies> They're multigenerational houses, when you have like 20 people living in them
[0:44:33] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> "A Lot of House to have?" -Patrick Fuckboivn
[0:44:34] <Coystick> Why the fuck is "Resident Evil" such a good title? I love the way it rolls off the tongue much more than "Biohazard"
[0:44:34] <cipher758> it's fine x1000
[0:44:35] <zeif00> Shows that you're psaBig rich
[0:44:35] <rytisone> Turn around and leave now
[0:44:35] <%thesyndrome> How RE7 would go in real life: "oh no one answered the buzzer, and this place is creepy, guess I'll have to leave" THE END
[0:44:36] <ChatNinja> Hope the gift is cookies
[0:44:37] <cyclog> Oh boy Texas Chainsaw Massacre the video game !
[0:44:40] <+tacostarvedbeast> accept her WAP
[0:44:41] <skyentombment> In the wise words of orange-head-having Karl Pilkington, this house is "Lo' of faffin'"
[0:44:42] <%Niney_Who> yeah it's very dark
[0:44:43] <Sapphire_Breeze> it's really dark
[0:44:43] <rbakervv> @aeronauticaljon yes, can barely see anything
[0:44:43] <FlashFrame> yes, stream is a bit dark
[0:44:44] <trulythedude> its super dark

[0:44:46] <%TigerCatGo> Pls let Paige do SHADOW PUZZZLLESSS
[0:44:46] <+xeros720> i assumed this part of the game was dark
[0:44:46] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> i thought that was just me and was literally currently adjusting my screen
[0:44:47] <+pynkdoe> it could be brighter
[0:44:47] <gade177> If I saw that sign I would fuck right off and get a new wife.
[0:44:48] <%GarbageQueenEllie> the real resident evil is the misqeets
[0:44:49] <EuropanLamprey> That would be a 180 for me "Sorry bitch, I'm out"
[0:44:51] <%happyface699> WORRY INDEED
[0:44:52] <+RyTYoung> yeah
[0:44:53] <%ragingbrachy> what the hell dude

[0:44:54] <marvel877> Lighting does look dark.

[0:45:14] <+CrimsonDio11> @PatStaresAt help how do I not get a ct raid for my AR roullette?
[0:45:19] <%Niney_Who> It's not that the stream is dark
[0:45:21] <%Solarint> troubleshooting streams are the best :D
[0:45:24] <%AngelCrossroads> When does this game take place in the time-line
[0:45:24] <%Niney_Who> your sub notif is fine
[0:45:25] <%ToneBacas> turn HDR off if it's on
[0:45:25] <unclekulikov> I thought it was just the nature of the game
[0:45:26] <%Niney_Who> the GAME is very dark
[0:45:28] <Aydarkzero> i dunno i can see
[0:45:29] <bluefooddye1> The deep, dark south
[0:45:30] <%thesyndrome> @PatStaresAt are you using HDR?

[0:49:21] <%happyface699> @massconnect thanks for the gift sub
[0:49:25] <Gallhint> YEAH but its TRU THO
[0:49:26] <Darren716> its true
[0:49:26] <%kyh9> Answer the question
[0:49:27] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[0:49:27] <thatjuantoo> seabatCHOICE
[0:49:29] <%nmaten> its uncanny
[0:49:30] <faithless_zealot> lul
[0:49:30] <gade177> I hate it when u can't skip scenes.
[0:49:30] <%Solarint> its the eyes
[0:49:30] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Good lord she is on so MUCH ecstasy
[0:49:32] <SirKeigan> But you can't tell
[0:49:33] <zeif00> But is it tho?
[0:49:33] <%Taisuru> Her face is based on a real person pat :V
[0:49:34] <Coystick> Mia Israel
[0:49:36] <%kyh9> The make-up
[0:49:36] <$RealThiele> truth hurts paige
[0:49:37] <smuggleruncle> she kinda looks like paige though
[0:49:38] <ohfricktrig> hahahaha
[0:49:38] <SirKeigan> SHe looks like she still might be on drugs tho
[0:49:40] <%thesyndrome> does Mia not have a facial capture model?
[0:49:40] <%Manwad> its the eyes
[0:49:40] <Talfri> she looks like she needs to lay off the mascara
[0:49:42] <%realm_forge> Meth head mia
[0:49:42] <%coyotesenpai> Her teeth have always bothered me
[0:49:42] <+eiightbiitt> where is the Orb cam?
[0:49:42] <+SneakyBeaver102> She creepy looking
[0:49:44] <MassConnect> @happyface699 yw
[0:49:44] <SirKeigan> Deep set eyes
[0:49:45] <+evbites> also the fictional person is a piece of shit
[0:49:46] <+rissaleigh14> It’s the truth tho
[0:49:46] <DeltaPangaea> Maybe something to do with the game's brightness not adjusting what the GAME actually makes, just what it sends to the screen? So game capture gets the un-brightness-altered view, but display capture gets what it actually shows?
[0:49:47] <BallerSwagBro9k> @RealThiele Dont worry Chris gonna fix that FOR THE BLOODLINE.
[0:49:47] <$RealThiele> used to
[0:49:50] <+R_BChe> is this pats f2nd run?
[0:49:54] <SirKeigan> Eyes
[0:49:54] <%Solarint> uncanny valley stuff
[0:49:55] <rytisone> this is strangely reminiscent of the Evil Dead Remake, her name Mia even
[0:49:56] <$RealThiele> LUL
[0:49:57] <%ClutchRoadagain> She looks like somebody I took barista-ing classes with
[0:49:57] <Darren716> The worse is that one girl in Livin da dream
[0:49:57] <%AkronymCLT> Isn't it a scan of a real person?
[0:49:57] <Gallhint> Mia IRL is very attractive
[0:50:00] <%Excel83> why we gotta see Mia's weird chin again?
[0:50:00] <Kalcom> usually
[0:50:01] <+CrimsonAscend> It's the eyes and the voice
[0:50:02] <Darren716> She got butchered
[0:50:03] <+RyTYoung> So true
[0:50:06] <Talfri> texture artists too much mascara and eyeshadow
[0:50:07] <+SneakyBeaver102> She reminds me of the PT lady
[0:50:11] <cascadepersona> Devil May Cry 5 did a really good job with it, though.
[0:50:11] <mutantlunchbox1> That uncany valley is drugs
[0:50:11] <%Huntercd> How old was Evie?
[0:50:12] <%happyface699> She look on drugs
[0:50:13] <%juxtest> Her face capture seems messed up
[0:50:13] <$Afterman_> this game is some big, "outlander! we have your woman" energy
[0:50:13] <%AkronymCLT> That's true
[0:50:16] <Ookamiden02> the gaps between her teeth kind of freak me out
[0:50:18] <%weissguard> What's up with Ethan's arms there? Is that supposed to be blood or dirt?
[0:50:19] <%GarbageQueenEllie> So is Mia waifu bait? Y/N?
[0:50:24] <Mr_Strut> How fat is he?
[0:50:24] <gade177> Did it just replay?
[0:50:25] <+eiightbiitt> Where's the Orb cam?
[0:50:27] <%CorpulentToad> Because she has new teeth after meth look. Puffy and baggy eyes.
[0:50:27] <%thesyndrome> in the RE engine it's a toss-up whether the women look great or weird, but the men are ALWAYS hot, what's up with that?
[0:50:27] <+RyTYoung> Even CHRIS looks like he's on drugs in this game
[0:50:29] <$RealThiele> NNNNNN
[0:50:30] <smuggleruncle> not enough polygons to look like earth human
[0:50:33] <%linSP> it’s called uncanny ballet
[0:50:34] <%phantomsleeves> capcom's face tech is uncanny valley for me all the time
[0:50:35] <zeif00> Who doesn't
[0:50:36] <+The_Butterfly_Man> he wants to be just like his father
[0:50:36] <derap41> XD
[0:50:36] <Psyramics> She's probably scanned from a real person, Pat

[0:57:41] <%ammobasket> it's clearly an art installation, don't question it
[0:57:43] <FlashFrame> LUL "there's probably bugs"
[0:57:44] <bookofmouths> mia's bag is trash
[0:57:44] <+oddlots_> If paige was here she'd of long gotten sick anyway
[0:57:47] <%arancet> paige isnt worth bugs
[0:57:47] <TonyR2014> Paige has no WAP confirmed
[0:57:47] <%Laecerelius> Pat will not face Plague's farm to save Paige confirmed
[0:57:49] <SpaceGuntank> imagine all the TICKS!
[0:57:49] <EuropanLamprey> Pat would not battle a Dragonfly for Paige's behalf
[0:57:50] <NATOaster> well Mia's in a swamp so if she didn't have a WAP before she went she's definitely got one now
[0:57:51] <dinnydanny777> Ethan comes to this place unarmed
[0:57:51] <%Agami23> ok but this building isnt that bad. besides the mold
[0:57:51] <%kelkellington> ready for marguerite's wap
[0:57:52] <+CptCreampuff16> pat dont lie you would love to be in a resident evil situation
[0:57:54] <+Dova573> but would you do it for Zangief?
[0:57:54] <SirKeigan> One look at this place and we'd know you were already dead
[0:57:55] <DeltaPangaea> OR Mia was important to his secret agent backstory.
[0:57:56] <%Solarint> who the fuck would enter this place without a minimum of 3 guns
[0:57:56] <%TigerCatGo> THE DRUUUUUGS
[0:57:57] <derap41> Well if anyone ever's going to kidnap paige now they know where to go
[0:57:59] <+RowenCleric> he wants to park that mac truck in this garage
[0:57:59] <$Afterman_> in-game lady LOOOVES some of that t-heroin
[0:58:00] <Mister_McDerp> it's Louisiana, there's a lot of bugs there
[0:58:02] <%blaggablag> SOMEONE has to feed the GIEF
[0:58:02] <%ToneBacas> yeah the real lady looks cute
[0:58:02] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt it's just an old house you'd expect to only have to beat one or two old men to death
[0:58:03] <ChatNinja> Paige already is part of the family after that potato salad
[0:58:05] <dinnydanny777> Ethan doesn't even bring a knife to this place
[0:58:06] <gade177> There r bugs.
[0:58:06] <%crimsonharvest> you'd do drugs too if you lived in there
[0:58:06] <2Bs_USB_port> that wet p-word
[0:58:09] <+raypoint_223> Pat activly trying to avoid being a resident evil character...yea sure...
[0:58:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> For my lover/family, I'd give the quest an old college try; but I would not enjoy it one bit
[0:58:11] <candidateplays> Well, she's had a rough couple of years
[0:58:13] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pat would bring ALL THE MOUNTIES to save Paige, like a smart hero.
[0:58:14] <%realm_forge> Pat hates taking out the trash he wouldn’t last 2 seconds in bumfuck Louisiana
[0:58:18] <%sbfiredragon> sbfiredragon subscribed with Twitch Prime.

[0:58:50] <absentking> ETHAN! GONNA GIVE UP ESCAPIN!
[0:58:51] <ChoculaUltra> "hey guys, gonna go look for my wife who's been missing for years in a backwater part of the deep south without bringing ANY backup."

[0:58:55] <shieldecho> RIP big puss
[0:58:57] <olibu> pat you're my favorite yeti

[0:59:00] <SirKeigan> Is that some kind of condition?
[0:59:00] <$RealThiele> personality, like a wet blanket
[0:59:02] <+pynkdoe> did ethan bring a bucket and a mop
[0:59:02] <%Solarint> wow this game actually looks amazing
[0:59:09] <SirKeigan> THAT"S GREAT!
[0:59:09] <0rond> big pussy energy
[0:59:09] <$Afterman_> the crazy mold is already inside ethan
[0:59:11] <MrWummzy> NICE BUTHOLE
[0:59:11] <KeystoneA2> @ninjaguiden This would be a good time for hololive Pat. AC being broken and all.
[0:59:13] <+mechslayer71> @datlambo458 Cuz Ben Shapiro’s a fucking square
[0:59:17] <derap41> Yeah most dogs don't know they can walk up stairs
[0:59:17] <Dr_Mooose> he must adapt
[0:59:19] <dinnydanny777> If Ethan is a secret agent why did he not bring a gun
[0:59:20] <thelonechris> Yes
[0:59:20] <FlashFrame> it's just Eli, all over.
[0:59:21] <%realm_forge> Plz show puppis I need it
[0:59:21] <ChoculaUltra> this game's textures/graphics are still amazing
[0:59:22] <$Afterman_> i could see it
[0:59:23] <ChatNinja> Is it not?
[0:59:24] <GeneralHysterics> too clean
[0:59:24] <devilmanjay> how is eli doing these days?
[0:59:26] <baronvonkame> it basically is though
[0:59:26] <Darren716> I know Pat, Eli wishes he had a house this nice

[0:59:32] <derap41> pretty much
[0:59:32] <heartlesshealer> please pause when you play with baby dog. We must know when he is being loved
[0:59:33] <+NitronStreams> this is his house on a good day
[0:59:34] <%kelkellington> gief cam pls
[0:59:35] <skyentombment> In the words of Eli, this house is the doodoo house
[0:59:35] <SirKeigan> yes
[0:59:38] <%Theycallmenerf> Hey what do you, 8 months! Here’s to Resident Evil 8! Hope you Pat, Paige, Elmo and Zangief are all doing well. I finally moved out of my parents and it’s awesome and terrifying at the same time!
[0:59:39] <indig0bird> He could break down the door but to be fair, he has no reason to break it down yet
[0:59:40] <BritishTyrannosaur> yum feet
[0:59:41] <+evbites> I like to think that ethan just has like 0 luck with ladies and he's like fuck it i'll die single either way
[0:59:41] <xxshadowxx416> go up stairs puppie
[0:59:41] <cipher758> Plague's Dungeon
[0:59:41] <rytisone> Eli's dinner
[0:59:42] <$Afterman_> Pat, as a kentuckian like Eli, I can confirm this is every house in the state
[0:59:42] <mastertwin2> This is just the first layer of The Fence
[0:59:44] <datlambo458> @mechslayer71 Completely forgot about that
[0:59:45] <%TigerCatGo> OH, NO, IT;S THE SHIT PAIGE ATE
[0:59:46] <2Bs_USB_port> mmmmm
[0:59:46] <%Alopekis> Alopekis subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 12 months, I guess. Say hi to Elmo, Zangief, and Mold Saliva!
[0:59:46] <+raypoint_223> i always immagined something smaller for plague....filled with sexy jackolope girls
[0:59:47] <+mmack093> You guys see Eli giant one sperm tweet?
[0:59:47] <+zsDirtyHarry> yummy
[0:59:47] <HarmlessCrow> @devilmanjay Tweeting about semen
[0:59:48] <%blaggablag> Full of grime and shortstack porn
[0:59:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> Zangief's power is chained by his doubts.
[0:59:48] <+Javatron69> is this just the opposite of "what a mansion"
[0:59:49] <thelonechris> Bugsnax
[0:59:49] <+Ether101_Prime> My dog has troubles with stairs ever scines she took a tumble.
[0:59:49] <BritishTyrannosaur> show feet cam coward
[0:59:50] <DoubtsBox> why would u do that
[0:59:50] <ha2ken> Eli food
[0:59:50] <bookofmouths> eat bug
[0:59:51] <ergulor> Paieh's lunch
[0:59:52] <%Taisuru> Pat if a bug touched you would you just melt?
[0:59:52] <2Bs_USB_port> tasty
[0:59:52] <Lutre> potato salad
[0:59:53] <ChoculaUltra> I mean what did he expect to find in the pot lmao
[0:59:55] <heartlesshealer> potato
[0:59:57] <shruke> good eats
[0:59:57] <bookofmouths> is snack
[0:59:59] <+BoboDaHobo> no camera today?
[0:59:59] <baronvonkame> are you playing this game in celebration of the potato salad? is that what's happening
[1:00:00] <$RealThiele> gumbo
[1:00:01] <DoubtsBox> u gotta know thats a bad idea
[1:00:03] <EuropanLamprey> How many Cockroaches would it take to defeat Pat, 1 or 2?
[1:00:05] <$Afterman_> @ChoculaUltra not bugs
[1:00:05] <Mister_McDerp> gumbo!
[1:00:05] <%happyface699> BUG
[1:00:06] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh look its potato salad
[1:00:06] <+evbites> potato
[1:00:10] <GeneralHysterics> big strong man ain't afraid of no evil shrine/entrance way but bugs? Rightfully skeeved
[1:00:10] <%SaiyanShoto> It’s only a matter of time until Pat runs off to marry Plague
[1:00:10] <stillteezy> i guess eating lunch right now wasn't the best idea
[1:00:11] <DoubtsBox> why would you willingly touch anything
[1:00:11] <dinnydanny777> So what's the explanation for that ghost that appears in here?
[1:00:15] <BritishTyrannosaur> hate when taps are left running in games
[1:00:15] <%Alopekis> Delicious
[1:00:16] <%Frost_Quill> It feels mean to say it, but there are a few houses near where I live that look like this inside. Just they're actually clean. I live in Kentucky btw.
[1:00:16] <%realm_forge> Mmmmm aged gumbo
[1:00:16] <datlambo458> he is a potato that must be protected from the irish
[1:00:19] <Mr_Strut> AAAAAAAAA
[1:00:19] <heart_ablaze> yum
[1:00:19] <+evbites> potao
[1:00:20] <Muffinmastr> is pat doing VR?
[1:00:23] <+raypoint_223> it looks like my fridge
[1:00:23] <skyentombment> Getting cockroaches anywhere other than the bottom of your shoes is fucking NIGHTMARISH
[1:00:26] <DeltaPangaea> Maybe Ethan just has entomophobia.
[1:00:29] <neraren> But how did he know bugs
[1:00:29] <%ospreyworks> Why did I only just now get the notification??? Gdi, Twitch.
[1:00:31] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Is that the potato salad shaped like puppy?
[1:00:33] <SirKeigan> I would just leave at this point
[1:00:35] <SirKeigan> like wtf
[1:00:35] <$Afterman_> jesus crhsit 20 in 2 years? that seems like more of an issue than it lets on
[1:00:36] <DeltaPangaea> Hardened agent man but scared of bugs
[1:00:46] <+NitronStreams> youd know if this was vr guys
[1:00:51] <$Afterman_> @SirKeigan hes locked into the house he cant. he missed his 2 chances
[1:00:52] <$RealThiele> local sheriff says "it is what it is"
[1:00:55] <heart_ablaze> not gonna lie, this looks like my grandmas house
[1:01:00] <+mmack093> Bugs are gross chat
[1:01:01] <%ospreyworks> Thanks for not telling me Pat had been streaming for an hour, Twitch.
[1:01:03] <+Ether101_Prime> It's farfetched to believe Ethan would come out here with no weapons.
[1:01:05] <DeltaPangaea> This house went to shit SUPER FUCKING QUICK, huh?
[1:01:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> Wait, shouldn't this place smell the most stank-ass ever? Old bread and cheese would have nothing on this.
[1:01:06] <%0nl00kr> I think VR is PS4 only
[1:01:06] <dinnydanny777> Can you see Ethan in the mirror?
[1:01:09] <ironhorsedell> this series will be the end of pat
[1:01:19] <rytisone> no hardcore huh?
[1:01:21] <$RealThiele> chats are gross, bug
[1:01:26] <%ragingbrachy> eat your soda
[1:01:27] <GhostAnimals> Anyone else prefer this to half of the screen being taken over? Like his facecam is fine, but...
[1:01:28] <DeltaPangaea> Like your family gets taken over by evil centipedes and the ceilings automatically fall off
[1:01:29] <TEEron11> isn't this game years old?
[1:01:29] <KeystoneA2> Just think, one of those saves probably contains the SHADOW PUZZLE
[1:01:30] <$Afterman_> @DeltaPangaea quick as in like..2-3 years or so
[1:01:31] <Aydarkzero> my favorite kind of footage
[1:01:31] <%Birdigalore> Yeah you hum that song
[1:01:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Should have had Ethan come in with all his weapons, lose them, then have to find them again
[1:01:35] <Kalcom> wait how did you not unlock
[1:01:38] <+pynkdoe> @ospreyworks at least you got one twitch never notifies me i just have to guess NotLikeThis
[1:01:39] <%realm_forge> Ethan’s got some veiny af hands
[1:01:40] <thelonechris> Mwah
[1:01:44] <BoneBagMel> I love you pat
[1:01:44] <%ragingbrachy> hes a one velvet
[1:01:45] <%Solarint> awww mjbLOVE
[1:01:46] <GeneralHysterics> yes, a single velvet
[1:01:48] <DeltaPangaea> This house looks like it's been abandoned for like 20-30
[1:01:49] <rat_boy1996> 2017? you din't play the Zoe dlc?
[1:01:55] <BoneBagMel> I look up to you pat, but just barely
[1:01:57] <+raypoint_223> @dinnydanny777 No the game cuts off the characters face and all
[1:02:00] <%ospreyworks> Usually, it's pretty good @pynkdoe
[1:02:01] <$Afterman_> @rat_boy1996 he did
[1:02:02] <gade177> There was a ghost?
[1:02:05] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Paige, why do you know this name. nevermind, i know why
[1:02:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> @heart_ablaze Dude, I had to help deal with some fucked up hoarder shit at my grandma's. The nightmare is real.
[1:02:07] <DeltaPangaea> I don't take care of my ceilings and they don't fall off.
[1:02:07] <skyentombment> PROTIP: Fuck bugs that are venomous or eat trash
[1:02:07] <ironhorsedell> hawt
[1:02:09] <DeltaPangaea> Usually.
[1:02:10] <rytisone> just remember Jack's 55 birthday
[1:02:10] <Muffinmastr> i entered the stream when pat was looking into the fridge and i thought it was live feed from his kitchen
[1:02:10] <Darren716> They did Zoe on the old channel
[1:02:11] <%ospreyworks> Also, Velveteen Rabbit was my jam, Paige
[1:02:12] <+RyTYoung> Cool
[1:02:16] <BritishTyrannosaur> ghosts? what is this the cancelled re4?
[1:02:16] <%Huntercd> What if the Redfield bloodline is already passed in RE8?
[1:02:20] <dinnydanny777> I could hear breathing
[1:02:22] <+Dives__> This place is a real fixer upper
[1:02:23] <GeneralHysterics> it's haunted, burn it down
[1:02:23] <%realm_forge> Puppy is a velvet blob monster and will consume all
[1:02:23] <%0nl00kr> I think the ghost was demo only
[1:02:23] <%Loinclothiclese> @dinnydanny777 @dinnydanny777 not in game but there is art of him
[1:02:26] <%Joustar_> haaaauuunted
[1:02:26] <%Solarint> oh no piano ghost
[1:02:27] <$RealThiele> pervy family photos
[1:02:29] <FlashFrame> Big spoopy
[1:02:31] <%Birdigalore> Jesus Ethan you might wanna get those veins checked out
[1:02:35] <SirKeigan> @PatStaresAt Your LP of this on the old channel was the first thing of you guys that I ever saw! Your banter with Matt actually made the concept of LPs watchable for me. It's more fun when there's someone to bounce off of. Back then it was Woolie and Matt, now it's Paige and Chat!!
[1:02:38] <%Solarint> pls be nice paino ghost
[1:02:40] <+Dives__> I dunno, a nice lamp would be nice
[1:02:42] <%Dualities> I hate that I'm more listening to how Pat and Paige interact with puppy, more than how Pat play game
[1:02:42] <kumaprime> ghost zombies
[1:02:43] <%Agami23> yeah but it would look like the normal ominousness of the south
[1:02:45] <+RyTYoung> LUL
[1:02:45] <BritishTyrannosaur> sorry ethan
[1:02:45] <Muffinmastr> this is my lamenting room
[1:02:46] <Mister_McDerp> Louisiana is SUPER haunted
[1:02:49] <$Afterman_> eli and his missig children
[1:02:50] <GeneralHysterics> oh shit, it's just eli
[1:02:50] <%skizzuto> the mold HATES pianos
[1:02:50] <+Goliz> Is there a reason why some games don't let you see your feet and legs? It really annoys me in fps games
[1:02:51] <BritishTyrannosaur> whyyyyyyyyy?
[1:02:52] <rat_boy1996> @Afterman_ oh true maybe he just didn't save on this
[1:02:52] <skyentombment> @Huntercd What, did Chris do the terrible deed and just fucked Claire?
[1:02:53] <thatjuantoo> DoritosChip
[1:02:54] <Aydarkzero> it's him!
[1:02:55] <+Jakev91489> One of my favorite RE games, I can speedrun this in like 2 hours
[1:02:55] <%phantomsleeves> is this the last RE he has to play? or is he doing the two remakes again after
[1:02:56] <%barrakuta371> Eli has kids?!
[1:02:59] <%AlphaTauri> pappa gripes
[1:03:00] <shieldecho> welcome to the family, son
[1:03:02] <$RealThiele> before he ate the children
[1:03:04] <Kuj999> Eli
[1:03:04] <+raypoint_223> @PatStaresAt When you start the tape there is a lockpick at clancys feet you can use for the drawer.
[1:03:04] <Ookamiden02> Hello Eli
[1:03:07] <TEEron11> swamps in general are pretty haunted
[1:03:07] <%ChrisPlaysThing> inb4 a Plague "Goddamnit"
[1:03:09] <$Afterman_> @barrakuta371 not anymore
[1:03:10] <Muffinmastr> papa gripes, lol
[1:03:10] <+evbites> @GarbageQueenEllie i'm pretty sure Ethan's like a salesmen even if he works for umbrella i think its the pharmacy side
[1:03:10] <BallerSwagBro9k> @Huntercd No he kills Mia to make Ethan continue the bloodline because Leon has dissapeared
[1:03:11] <datlambo458> Eli is a single father
[1:03:12] <heart_ablaze> @generalscpatton yeah, its disgusting
[1:03:14] <%SaiyanShoto> Plague married a nice big woman

[1:03:48] <+Dives__> Chat was right for once
[1:03:50] <+bowser_drums90> is this the VR version?
[1:03:50] <%Big_Dream> Big_Dream subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 3 month streak! RE7 cool
[1:03:50] <@SoFarFetched> oh god Im getting flashbacks to pat telling Paige about finding this Lockpick when she was playing it.

[1:03:54] <%ToneBacas> nice*
[1:03:56] <+twin_triggers> odd
[1:04:00] <dukeoftime> Fuck I never knew that
[1:04:00] <dinnydanny777> These guys deserved to die
[1:04:00] <%Huntercd> Eli might be a good parent

[1:04:06] <Muffinmastr> if eli had kids theyd be names sperm 1 and sperm 2
[1:04:08] <dinkyrink> what kind of youtube personality "doesn't do ADR"
[1:04:10] <rytisone> VR does not work on pc
[1:04:11] <gade177> Man this camera guy gets super fucked.
[1:04:11] <%ToneBacas> Pat would shit ass if he played this in VR
[1:04:12] <BritishTyrannosaur> oof
[1:04:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> Thanks woolieONEGUY
[1:04:14] <$Afterman_> they got it pretty damn bad
[1:04:15] <kumaprime> ghostfacers
[1:04:15] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @evbites Hmm perhaps. Would've been funny if he went in with a bunch of crack and molotovs
[1:04:15] <%Birdigalore> @GhostAnimals Their AC is busted so Pat's sitting around naked
[1:04:19] <%Agami23> @GhostAnimals basically because no AC so he cant use his cam, so whats the point
[1:04:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> honk
[1:04:28] <%DakotaMacDoodle> @PatStaresAt What if RE8 just has supernatural werewolves and shit and there is no bioweapons stuff
[1:04:29] <unclekulikov> is that the Doom grunt?
[1:04:29] <Coystick> Is the Zoe DLC good, on sale atm
[1:04:42] <%Huntercd> This is some white people shit
[1:04:44] <+xeros720> he's pretty much streaming shirtless, so it's twitch's fault really
[1:04:50] <dinkyrink> Zoe DLC rules
[1:04:51] <$Afterman_> actually yes
[1:04:52] <thelonechris> Breaking and entering
[1:04:53] <+mmack093> Breaking and entering is illegal
[1:04:53] <$RealThiele> werewolf is just a human with more biomass
[1:04:53] <$Afterman_> very haunted
[1:04:54] <%Meekest> Sounds about right
[1:04:54] <datlambo458> this way pat wont shit his pants, just the couch
[1:04:55] <Srthunda> they probably didnt
[1:04:55] <rytisone> they took two seconds to look
[1:04:56] <skyentombment> It has the BIO EVIL
[1:04:57] <+NitronStreams> Its BIO HAUNTED
[1:04:57] <BallerSwagBro9k> NO PREP
[1:04:58] <gade177> They probably didn't. They seem stupid.
[1:05:02] <codycurry52> this is them checking
[1:05:06] <Lagseene> Is it hounted... or is it infected??
[1:05:06] <GhostAnimals> Thanks for the explanation folks! My dreams of a return to Pat content with the gameplay taking the majority of the screen are shattered
[1:05:06] <Tomagen> I hope Re8 is also scary like this.
[1:05:08] <dinnydanny777> Did they see the dismembered deer?
[1:05:15] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Why is it that the white folks always poke their noses into deadly sketchy shit?
[1:05:16] <%GeneralSCPatton> @dakotamacdoodle Instead of a BioCurse, it's a ThaumaVirus.
[1:05:20] <+evbites> Father can i have a name yet. Plague: no worthless not until your 18 birthday
[1:05:20] <cipher758> big haunted. it's going to scare you to death
[1:05:23] <TheHeroAppears> Pat blown out LUL
[1:05:25] <BallerSwagBro9k> @Tomagen Trailer is promising
[1:05:27] <wibbwobbler> the locals must think it's abandoned, creepy
[1:05:29] <GoldenColts> zak bagans ghost adventures Pog
[1:05:29] <%ClericOfSparda> No wonder the old Anchor is dead. He just got roasted!
[1:05:29] <%Meekest> Don't the Bakers still live in the house next door and interact with cops
[1:05:30] <skyentombment> And the winner is...........CLANCYYYYY
[1:05:32] <$Afterman_> 3 years in the Louisiana hot swamp would definitely fuck up a house
[1:05:33] <TonyR2014> wouldn't they need permits to film here? like wouldn't the crew check who owns the property?
[1:05:35] <%TigerCatGo> PAIGE FOOD
[1:05:35] <$RealThiele> well its a plantation so white ppl are naturally drawn to it
[1:05:37] <%ssjklyco> Keyword, Was. Which means you weren't good enough to be weekend sub.
[1:05:40] <Aydarkzero> Lucas is the worst
[1:05:40] <JayEarly> @garbagequeenellie we get bored easy
[1:05:52] <gade177> Yeah Lucas gets his though.
[1:05:52] <%Maids4lyfe> lucas murdered people
[1:05:56] <BallerSwagBro9k> Lucas has done some SHIT
[1:05:57] <%Solarint> who the fuck wears "good shoes" to something like this, let alone a suit
[1:05:59] <sologarza> Is that potato salad?
[1:06:01] <%Maids4lyfe> before the evil happened
[1:06:03] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @JayEarly This is true. I'd be dead if not for the internet
[1:06:07] <rytisone> Andre is dead
[1:06:10] <GeneralHysterics> the giant?
[1:06:12] <$Afterman_> hes alraedy fuckin dead
[1:06:13] <BritishTyrannosaur> Lucas has that kind of evil you can't not appreciate
[1:06:16] <+raypoint_223> @PatStaresAt you have now affected the world through the video tape....
[1:06:16] <devilmanjay> IT WAS WESKER
[1:06:18] <alexandrecau> Joe baker did some shit too and no one hates him
[1:06:21] <$RealThiele> hes not dead hes sleeping
[1:06:22] <%Maids4lyfe> it was paige's potato salad
[1:06:25] <TheHeroAppears> he's in the blair witch now
[1:06:33] <%Dualities> Has Zangief discovered ice cubes?
[1:06:35] <+demon1103> "rumors"
[1:06:37] <skyentombment> And the winner is........
[1:06:39] <$Afterman_> "where did you find this guy?" 30 seconds later, "a good cameraman like you? stick with me."
[1:06:40] <BritishTyrannosaur> which one of the 30 wesker siblings did this?
[1:06:41] <Aydarkzero> Ghost was also at the top of the stairs in the demo
[1:06:43] <skyentombment> HOFFMENNNNNN
[1:06:48] <%JohnAtDawn> So why is Pat playing this again? And no webcam?
[1:06:55] <Kalcom> so what's up with ghost
[1:06:57] <%TheFabledAble> you mean the bio ghost that turned out to be an old lady who was recently a child?
[1:06:57] <+evbites> Clancy:Fuck this i'm freelance
[1:07:00] <%mike2hands> UNFUCKIN BELIEAVEABLE
[1:07:01] <BallerSwagBro9k> @devilmanjay Man i miss that asshole and his glasses. I want him back FeelsBadMan
[1:07:01] <wasdknife> im back and i got ice cream
[1:07:04] <%happyface699> Scary
[1:07:04] <$Afterman_> i legit feel bad for these schmucks.
[1:07:05] <TonyR2014> I want more ghosts in Resident Evil
[1:07:08] <$joylent_blue> JohnAtDawn RE marathon, and because its hot so pat is nekkid
[1:07:09] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I'd respect the dumb horror victims going into the haunted place if they at least had a gun on them. Like Alien 2
[1:07:10] <%Huntercd> Pat is naked
[1:07:10] <Aydarkzero> @JohnAtDawn Resi Marathon and A/C is broken so no shirt
[1:07:10] <jowi_time> Their AC is on the fritz again
[1:07:17] <%BestTeaMaker> Clancy got it real bad
[1:07:17] <$RealThiele> Clancy "real name" Javis
[1:07:18] <xxshadowxx416> he dead
[1:07:19] <+raypoint_223> Clancy gets it rough
[1:07:23] <+mmack093> This does honestly seem like something Zach Baggins and his douche brigade would do
[1:07:24] <rosemon5001> @JohnAtDawn webcam is probably because fucking hot as shit
[1:07:26] <%GalacticaPhanto> @johnatdawn Hes still going on there marathon
[1:07:27] <%JohnAtDawn> Oh wow I forgot about the marathon
[1:07:27] <%Huntercd> Naked stream
[1:07:27] <DeltaPangaea> I forget, Clancy's in one of the DLCs, right?
[1:07:30] <+Dives__> Weird how he just finds it so easy
[1:07:30] <rytisone> Andre went into a fireplace
[1:07:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> @solarint You go into this with boots, motorcycle-level denim/leather, gloves, and STRAPPED.
[1:07:32] <gade177> I feel bad for Andre and the camera guy but not this guy.
[1:07:38] <GeneralHysterics> how much time have you spent there pat?
[1:07:40] <skyentombment> @JohnAtDawn He explained it earlier with "Haven't you seen what channel this is?"
[1:07:41] <+xeros720> yeah, they don't know how machines work
[1:07:43] <Aydarkzero> they ran into Southern Batmans house LUL
[1:07:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Underground railway houses
[1:07:44] <jowi_time> Pat is currently baring his orb for no one to see
[1:07:46] <GeneralHysterics> If you didn't find the secret passages, they did their job
[1:07:47] <%Maids4lyfe> how tf would you know Pat?
[1:07:47] <$Afterman_> it was an underground railroad house. v standard
[1:07:47] <%BestTeaMaker> @DeltaPangaea he gets tortured by the jerk son yeah
[1:07:48] <+evbites> no it's legit moonshiners and whatnot
[1:07:48] <%Birdigalore> New New Deal: Fuck Andre
[1:07:48] <dinnydanny777> Does it get more cliche than a secret passageway hidden in a fireplace
[1:07:49] <%Dementedpenguin> "Fuck this show. Let's leave Andre." sounds better.
[1:07:49] <skyentombment> so not sure
[1:07:50] <%the_mental_punk> Actually it's more standard then you think
[1:07:50] <%Strider222> yeah fuck it
[1:07:52] <%TheFabledAble> TheFabledAble subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! fuck yea bean watching this dumbass play games beautifully and perfectly for 4 months yo
[1:07:53] <Dr_Mooose> secret rooms are standard
[1:07:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> Goddammit George Trevor
[1:07:54] <%Agami23> it is if your home was built by spencer
[1:07:56] <%happyface699> Hear that zach?
[1:07:57] <%JohnAtDawn> Yes
[1:07:57] <%FabledGuy> yeah
[1:07:58] <Darren716> Yeah
[1:07:58] <$RealThiele> its how the slaves got around without being seen
[1:07:58] <$galaxyswirl> no
[1:07:59] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I mean, shit. I would totally have my house set up with hidden rooms and shit if i could afford to.
[1:08:00] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Kinda
[1:08:00] <%Jaysky> You haven't shot any aligators yet wtf
[1:08:00] <Chatterbox1991> hell yeah
[1:08:01] <%SirGO0SE> its certainly the south
[1:08:01] <$Afterman_> georgia is deep deep south
[1:08:01] <+xeros720> yeah, georgia
[1:08:02] <$galaxyswirl> hell no
[1:08:02] <Darren716> Texas too
[1:08:03] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[1:08:03] <%the_mental_punk> no
[1:08:03] <%Agami23> yeah kinda.
[1:08:03] <pmk4609> Moderate south
[1:08:04] <%SaiyanShoto> You don’t know, maybe Paiges house has that as a kid
[1:08:05] <gade177> No.
[1:08:05] <%lemon_rinds> The Deep South is always full of surprises
[1:08:06] <Chatterbox1991> deepest of deep south
[1:08:06] <TonyR2014> this is the first time I've hated the deep south, Zach
[1:08:06] <+wybo111> yea it is
[1:08:07] <%ssjklyco> Dank south
[1:08:07] <%afronooch> yes and no
[1:08:08] <+lordericter> you don't have a secret crawlspace in your deep south?
[1:08:09] <BanConquer> Yes
[1:08:09] <+evbites> It's prohibition shit
[1:08:09] <%Maids4lyfe> Atlanta is super south
[1:08:11] <%Agami23> its like the northest part of the deep south.
[1:08:13] <Visorak6> yes
[1:08:13] <+LastHazzerd> physically not so much, but aesthetically yes
[1:08:14] <SirKeigan> Yes and no
[1:08:16] <codycurry52> live in the kentucky can confirm it's pretty accurate
[1:08:18] <GhostAnimals> I think it's because characters exist in our reality until they get to the spook zone. I wouldn't be scared to enter a "Haunted" house in real life, why would they?
[1:08:18] <gade177> Atlanta's not the deep south.
[1:08:19] <%afronooch> location wise, sure, culture wise no
[1:08:21] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Yes
[1:08:22] <Gallhint> Deep south in the biggest cities lmao
[1:08:22] <%the_mental_punk> No you gotta out to bumble fuck for the deep south
[1:08:22] <+mechslayer71> That’s DEEP ASS SOUTH
[1:08:25] <%TigerCatGo> SPOOKY STUFF SOON
[1:08:26] <$Afterman_> pats nips got hella milky in the south
[1:08:27] <%TigerCatGo> OH NO
[1:08:27] <SirKeigan> Depends where in Atlanta
[1:08:28] <devilmanjay> is yexas the deep south?
[1:08:28] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt did you live
[1:08:28] <mellorolo> eli would be like Jiriya if he had a kid, he had it bad but if he was allowed hed step up especially if he wasnt confined to a farmhouse society full of filthy farmers and bludgerous heathens hiding beneath what restricts the nutrients from reaching my grass.
[1:08:30] <+NitronStreams> Pat is basically a cowboy now
[1:08:30] <+xeros720> i wish i could say texas wasn't deep south, but i saw their political situation
[1:08:31] <%TigerCatGo> DEEP SOUTH
[1:08:31] <Aydarkzero> oh no is he okay?
[1:08:32] <BallerSwagBro9k> ATLANTA DOESNT COUNT
[1:08:34] <rat_boy1996> Atlanta is south, not DEEP south
[1:08:35] <$joylent_blue> is he ok?
[1:08:35] <%GarbageQueenEllie> When people think South, they often think more rural. But Atlanta is in the Deep South
[1:08:39] <skyentombment> IT'S THE SILENT HILL SHIT
[1:08:40] <gade177> Not even location wise.
[1:08:45] <$RealThiele> luckily southern food can be made outside the south
[1:08:46] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt I thought the deep south was hell
[1:08:47] <ToneBacas> did it smell like cajun and incest?
[1:08:48] <%Huntercd> do suck pipes kids
[1:08:51] <wibbwobbler> funny enough Texas isn't deep south
[1:08:52] <%Dementedpenguin> psaGib psaGief
[1:08:52] <VritraReiRei> Every time someone says, "DEEP SOUTH" I cant help think of Little Nicky, lmao. "The South. The DEEP South. hehe."
[1:08:54] <+pynkdoe> who does he remind you of zack? thats right im talking about hougan
[1:08:58] <%Cozy90> were meeting G over "THERE"
[1:08:59] <%TigerCatGo> I wish for Zangief and Elmo stream
[1:09:06] <gentlemanboxer> bawkFace bawkFace
[1:09:07] <jowi_time> He sucked too hard
[1:09:10] <+Pendragwn> @ToneBacas it felt like insect and smelted like cajun!
[1:09:11] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Should probably just not try to give hooks blowjobs
[1:09:11] <%Th3SmartAlec> Camera is off to censor Elmo T-Posing
[1:09:14] <mastertwin2> I mean it probably stabbed his neck
[1:09:14] <rytisone> cool aid was oozing from that pipe
[1:09:14] <%TigerCatGo> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo psaGief psaGief
[1:09:14] <+Dives__> No pipe sucking in this household!
[1:09:15] <DeltaPangaea> "Person standing silently against a wall and spooky when turn around" is pretty bog standard spook.
[1:09:16] <%Dualities> Elmo vs Zangief is my favorite MUGEN match
[1:09:16] <+mmack093> Did you meet your sister paige in the deep south @PatStaresAt
[1:09:16] <%happyface699> @vritrareirei HENRY GOT ATTACKED BY BEEESS
[1:09:18] <%Psyramics> being in airports doesn't count. every airport is connected to the same airport dimension
[1:09:19] <jowi_time> sucked his own brains out his head
[1:09:20] <%Joustar_> angery
[1:09:22] <%ospreyworks> Yeah, what was meant to be wrong with him?
[1:09:24] <BallerSwagBro9k> LETS INTO THE SAME HOLE GENIUS
[1:09:24] <cipher758> the Elmo Zangief Civil War. big lore
[1:09:25] <HibikiYamada> planning on beating this today? @PatStaresAt
[1:09:28] <$Afterman_> this shit feels very southern gothic to me, at least this portion of the game
[1:09:30] <KaiserMario> And then, Lucas got Clancy
[1:09:30] <unclekulikov> Oh, GOOD GIEF
[1:09:30] <rytisone> Precious
[1:09:30] <%ospreyworks> He just looked ambiguously bloody
[1:09:33] <%nmaten> precious
[1:09:35] <%GarbageQueenEllie> No Chief Gief, nooo
[1:09:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> Wait, this is a world where BOWs are a known public issue. Shouldn't all "haunted" locations be suspected as BOW nests?
[1:09:38] <Tomagen> är
[1:09:40] <%TigerCatGo> MY PRECIOUS ANTIQUE COINS
[1:09:40] <+lordericter> find the mannequin finger to fix the fuse box
[1:09:42] <Guardiansaiyan> re-organizing my manga...thanks for streaming @PatStaresAt
[1:09:42] <%Dementedpenguin> Gief doing a piledrive WutFace
[1:09:44] <JayEarly> kitty screm
[1:09:44] <%ospreyworks> And the sound effect made it dsound like he was impaled
[1:09:46] <+SkaiVibration> is this pc or ps4? just jumped in
[1:09:46] <LoneFonte> will you do dlcs later?
[1:09:47] <BallerSwagBro9k> SPEEDRUN
[1:09:49] <%ssjklyco> It was Neirly good
[1:09:51] <+pynkdoe> <3 :)
[1:09:52] <Gallhint> That Grounded stream tho...
[1:09:53] <+RyTYoung> Speedrun for the achievo in 2 hours
[1:09:56] <dinnydanny777> Is RE6 canon in this worls
[1:09:56] <+SkaiVibration> thx pat :)
[1:09:56] <%happyface699> MY PRECIOUS ANTIQUE COIN
[1:09:57] <$RealThiele> Elmo and him will eventually have it out
[1:09:59] <$joylent_blue> its always a good stream LuvSign
[1:10:00] <thehetmanm> we need a gief cam
[1:10:03] <faithless_zealot> @PatStaresAt Pat, in all sincerity, I would much rather you take care of yourself, than stream
[1:10:03] <$Afterman_> @GeneralSCPatton shhh dont mention that
[1:10:04] <%Th3SmartAlec> the first hour is a walking simulator, it kinda sucks on replay
[1:10:05] <%SirGO0SE> grounded stream was amazing
[1:10:05] <%weissguard> Nier Raid was pretty PogChamp
[1:10:06] <%SaiyanShoto> I thought Pat said Paige was gonna jump off the couch for a sec LUL
[1:10:07] <%Dualities> if he chases his own not-tail is it a lariat?
[1:10:08] <+mechslayer71> This came out before the RE games started getting stupid short
[1:10:08] <+Zutrax> Has Pat ever played this in VR? I wish the PC version had the VR functionality, it makes this game so much better.
[1:10:09] <%mike2hands> is gonna fall sleep again
[1:10:10] <DeltaPangaea> Y'know there's probably Hunters interbreeding with the gators down in Florida.
[1:10:15] <%Huntercd> Gief spinning lariat against Elmo hadouken
[1:10:22] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Pffft He got Aerith'd
[1:10:27] <Gallhint> I really hate how this game did my boy Clancy...
[1:10:27] <%phantomsleeves> grounded stream was hilarious
[1:10:30] <GhostAnimals> @GeneralSCPatton That's a pretty good question. We only ever encounter BOWs as members of elite special units or whatever, so who knows what the general public knows
[1:10:33] <HanDaimond> Eeeethaaaan~
[1:10:34] <ulcaban> It's a delicious pipe
[1:10:36] <$Afterman_> @DeltaPangaea well in the godly outbreak games, there WAS a zombie gator in the zoo
[1:10:37] <%Dualities> I thought elmo would have berserker barrage
[1:10:38] <+CatYamHD> there's a VR mod but I don't think it functions the same way
[1:10:40] <ninjaguiden> It's very strange watching your old DP1 LP now BTW, but the tone of the game is as good as I recalled
[1:10:41] <%ClutchRoadagain> Its the feeding pipe
[1:10:42] <+xeros720> i thought hunts had more in common with amphibians generally
[1:10:43] <rytisone> new content
[1:10:43] <BritishTyrannosaur> we stan clancy
[1:10:44] <gentlemanboxer> Zangief doing ultimate atomic busters to elmo
[1:10:53] <+mmack093> Andre probably got ated
[1:10:58] <ulcaban> God, that water looks like it stinks
[1:10:59] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Zangief love Kitty
[1:11:01] <Gallhint> SPOOKY DEAD MAN AHHHHH
[1:11:03] <+xeros720> which one
[1:11:04] <+evbites> i'm amazed how quick Ethan's clothes dry
[1:11:08] <%crimsonharvest> there's the water area in Amnesia
[1:11:09] <%DensityD> boo
[1:11:09] <$joylent_blue> Zangief must assert his cuteness on his cat fren
[1:11:10] <wibbwobbler> werewolves and witches in re8
[1:11:10] <%walternatorz> are you thinking call of cthulu?
[1:11:11] <$RealThiele> Elmo has to get in quick with a super before gief command grabs
[1:11:12] <$Afterman_> that is definnitely some stagnant ass water
[1:11:12] <+NitronStreams> Hi Clancy
[1:11:14] <xxshadowxx416> elmo will puppie
[1:11:15] <%CrookedSpiral> in Sinking City? yeah
[1:11:16] <MassConnect> the deep RE7
[1:11:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> YUP
[1:11:20] <+xeros720> i think the intro is similar, yeah
[1:11:21] <heart_ablaze> @patstaresat plan on this beating the whole thing or is this just a one off stream?
[1:11:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> that doesn't narrow it down Pat
[1:11:26] <+Dives__> Stewed to perfection
[1:11:32] <%Maids4lyfe> that was Andre
[1:11:32] <Gallhint> That water must smell like moldy dick
[1:11:32] <+xeros720> oh, wasn't even thinking of sinking city
[1:11:36] <BritishTyrannosaur> he's just vibin
[1:11:37] <DeltaPangaea> And again no verbal reaction from Ethan for the maggotcorpse
[1:11:39] <+The_Butterfly_Man> are zangief and elmo mean to each other or does zangief just want to play?
[1:11:40] <$joylent_blue> oh no
[1:11:41] <$RealThiele> yay for swimming in clancy stew
[1:11:42] <Gallhint> oh god
[1:11:42] <%Joustar_> no seriously, who would explore a place like this alone and unarmed?
[1:11:42] <%happyface699> Yum

[1:14:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ghostanimals I know it depends a lot on when in the timeline, and whether REV 1 is canon. If it is canon, then you have huge Bioterrorism destroying a floating city of the future, and TerraSave being publicly advertised as anti-BOW.

[1:19:12] <DeltaPangaea> @Big_Dream Cuz wife is evil
[1:19:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt is paige going to do the shadow puzzles?
[1:19:19] <Gallhint> Can you let paige do the shadow puzzles again on this stream so she can redeem herself?
[1:19:20] <%crimsonharvest> because your wife is a mold monster
[1:19:22] <Darren716> One thing i dont like about RE7, this intro is way too long

[1:19:26] <bluefooddye1> And short hair, don't forget the short hair
[1:19:28] <@SoFarFetched> "its like a Female Plague and that shit I like" - Pat
[1:19:28] <%ScottishMadJacko> Zoe is million times better than mia
[1:19:29] <%Piemono> That's not how accents work
[1:19:32] <$joylent_blue> southerly accent
[1:19:32] <%ScottishMadJacko> Mia sucks ass
[1:19:34] <+ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[1:19:35] <%Dualities> he will teach you the game. He knocks the toy off, and you two pick it up
[1:19:35] <JayEarly> he is dumb but he is baby
[1:19:38] <%Dementedpenguin> Because the players spent more time in-game, therefore that means she's better than your years' long wife Kappa
[1:19:38] <+evbites> but by saving the wife you save zoe
[1:19:38] <TheHeroAppears> oh no
[1:19:40] <ulcaban> GOTEM
[1:19:40] <%AngriestAngryArtist> lol
[1:19:40] <GhostAnimals> @Pendragwn That's a higher tier of poverty than I meant
[1:19:42] <%Birdigalore> Zoe's accent fluctuates between south and DEEP SOUTH

[1:22:22] <BlkFlameKami> don't kink shame
[1:22:22] <2Bs_USB_port> all better
[1:22:22] <GhostAnimals> Yeah, you're not a normal dude if you grab a knife by the blade and don't immediately shit yourself.
[1:22:23] <Talfri> I'd chalk it up to adrenaline
[1:22:24] <$dalmek> that's just how Mia did things
[1:22:24] <rytisone> he's into it
[1:22:26] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> We squeezed out the evil from the herb to use in your residence
[1:22:27] <Talfri> and shock
[1:22:27] <+Dives__> I like how it's ambiguous
[1:22:28] <DeltaPangaea> I notice he says 'what the fuck are you' too, not 'what happened to you'
[1:22:28] <%InfamousMoose> InfamousMoose subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[1:22:29] <$joylent_blue> what IS Ethan's backstory
[1:22:29] <cipher758> that's a weird foreplay
[1:22:32] <+Dannzzyy> Piss on her corpse
[1:22:32] <Djinnazz> Or lunged at.
[1:22:34] <tiaramaki> Ohhh now that makes me sad to think about
[1:22:37] <Sunstalker> Thatsmy superpower. :) getting stabbed
[1:22:37] <+evbites> gah fuck
[1:22:38] <misterspotswood> we dont really get a backstory on ethan right? maybe he was a bad ass before RE7
[1:22:39] <$Wafflum> It seems to just be willful control by the girl at any given moment. I'm pretty sure range doesn't matter (at least as much as you have here).
[1:22:39] <%Maids4lyfe> Ethan's clearly had combat training
[1:22:41] <jowi_time> from what that juiice DOES it would be the favourite of EVERYONE
[1:22:43] <%FacetiousAF> that juice is what you get when you put da lime in da coconut and mix is all up
[1:22:43] <DeltaPangaea> He's aware she's something ELSE
[1:22:45] <0rond> isn't ethan ex military or something?
[1:22:46] <Talfri> she's got some strong legs to just geet up like that
[1:22:47] <%SaiyanShoto> Mia tried to stab him in the past multiple times Kappa
[1:22:48] <+JVolfram> Doused himself in monster
[1:22:50] <+notkojima> thank God this is their Axe Room
[1:22:51] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Is Ethan a fucking robot? How tf is he this durable
[1:22:51] <%MidnightBurst12> ok goodbye
[1:22:52] <ha2ken> Bork
[1:22:52] <%ssjklyco> Considering he lives in RE world, this is probably normal for him.
[1:22:54] <$joylent_blue> YAP
[1:22:56] <%nmaten> booo
[1:22:56] <%kyh9> I can't tell what's the game and what's paige

[1:23:14] <+skylerpilot> do we actually know anything about Ethan? Who actually is / was he
[1:23:14] <BritishTyrannosaur> press rt to xe your wife
[1:23:14] <%ScottishMadJacko> This game had good parry mechanics and shit which was weird
[1:23:15] <@SoFarFetched> Then Ethan develops a weird kink later of wanting his wife to put him in a chokehold.
[1:23:18] <0rond> either combat training, or multiple ex girlfriends....
[1:23:20] <+evbites> YEAH
[1:23:22] <mellorolo> when are you going to throw the axe into nonexistance
[1:23:23] <JayEarly> it’s weird how Ethan is presented as an everyman
[1:23:24] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> Good couples therapy sesh babe
[1:23:25] <%AncelDeLambert> knife to meet you
[1:23:25] <misterspotswood> @Maids4lyfe imma say hes a secret bad ass

[1:23:28] <%ClericOfSparda> I can't wait for Zangief to be old enough to get upset and bark at all the bad characters
[1:23:29] <killr0ckstars> if the polices asks you you can sy it was an AXE-ident
[1:23:30] <mellorolo> when are you going to throw the axe into nonexistance?
[1:23:30] <very_ap3> I have a hard time believing skinny ass Ethan was in the military
[1:23:30] <Talfri> no reaction
[1:23:31] <+gnoame> His body is one big stab wound, ever attack gives him more mass
[1:23:31] <BritishTyrannosaur> axe handle punch yeyeyeyey

[1:23:36] <Aydarkzero> i can't believe she's dead
[1:23:37] <%nmaten> SAVED
[1:23:37] <GhostAnimals> Do you think Ethan and Mia stayed together after this?
[1:23:38] <hammerstein50> I think Ethan works for Neo Umbrella but not as a soldier
[1:23:38] <%Aeoneth> ho freakouts
[1:23:38] <%BestTeaMaker> Mia and Ethan must've had kinky af sex after this whole ordeal

[1:23:41] <%Strider222> love how Ethan is just silent
[1:23:41] <%ssjklyco> Ironically, she is the one wearing a wife beater, or at least close to one.
[1:23:43] <+notkojima> neat, it's mold
[1:23:43] <$Afterman_> loot her dead body
[1:23:43] <BritishTyrannosaur> we did it
[1:23:43] <cipher758> wife defeated
[1:23:44] <thetruenicster> You'd Think He'd React More To Possibly KILLING HIS WIFE
[1:23:44] <%Th3SmartAlec> @wasdknife You can here him (or his clone or whatever) screaming from the helicopter in the distance
[1:23:44] <%Xevtes> chris is gonna get her soon
[1:23:44] <smuggleruncle> "lets bury the hatchet"
[1:23:46] <%happyface699> My wife

[1:23:50] <%Birdigalore> i have brought democracy to my wife!
[1:23:51] <ChoculaUltra> the fact he doesn't even do the "oh god what have I done" thing also kinda tells me he's killed people close to him before...

[1:23:54] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt I'm concerned about the relationship considering how quickly he turns to beat down mode on her
[1:23:54] <absentking> HO HO
[1:23:55] <%kyh9> F
[1:23:56] <$Afterman_> "im sorry ethan" PEW PEW PEW

[1:24:01] <+punklogan> Kill your waifu to get back your laifu
[1:24:03] <stardustcrusad3r> OBJECTIVE: BEAT WIFE
[1:24:04] <skyentombment> Quick, invade this family's personal space like a hero
[1:24:07] <GhostAnimals> Even with mind control this is some divorce level shit for me.
[1:24:10] <+professormorrigan> groovy.
[1:24:11] <Aydarkzero> V has come to
[1:24:12] <%cylish> He also seems to be able to have a throwdown, trading blows with someone who can throw a human through walls and still get like 10 feet beyond it. That's Redfield tough
[1:24:12] <%Rekinsinn> is it too hot for pat cam again?
[1:24:12] <+notkojima> hello, yes this is wife killer who am I speaking to?
[1:24:13] <%ClutchRoadagain> Finally, now Ethan can grill and fish to his hearts' content.
[1:24:15] <0rond> why does she have to turn hot right when you kill her
[1:24:17] <DeltaPangaea> And then she's instantly gone the moment you look away
[1:24:18] <+Arkfyre> Kreygasm
[1:24:20] <dukeoftime> @MidnightBurst12 Beat me to it
[1:24:21] <Aydarkzero> Zoe PogChamp
[1:24:22] <%ScottishMadJacko> Best girl
[1:24:24] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Roasted_Pheasant subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months! Two years of subs, and two months of employment making coffee. Current highlights include my coworkers "correcting" things I'm doing correctly and my boss yelling at me to do my job while I do my job. Glad you escaped retail hell, hope I do too.
[1:24:24] <%Strider222> moschi moschi
[1:24:25] <%Nomad_Scholar> Pat saved her the same way the US saves other countries oil.
[1:24:25] <+professormorrigan> zoay
[1:24:26] <ha2ken> Zo-ay
[1:24:28] <ChoculaUltra> awfully chill for someone who just killed his wife

[1:24:30] <heart_ablaze> oh hi short hair lady Kreygasm
[1:24:30] <%Kojixif> Zo-eh
[1:24:31] <mastertwin2> gross
[1:24:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> @jowi_time Remember, the heal juice is mostly accelerating the healing factor from the Mold. It's not that powerful on normies.
[1:24:35] <+NitronStreams> my names Zoe and I am your new waifu
[1:24:35] <CandideCamera> remember when everyone thought that was Ada on the phone during the demo
[1:24:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> pat the dog but
[1:24:39] <%Birdigalore> My name's ZOWEY!
[1:24:40] <BallerSwagBro9k> @cerellium And thats why i dont care for him as a protagonist. He way too mute in these kinds of situations
[1:24:43] <+Ches_Neckbeard> where is dog cam?!
[1:24:45] <+mmack093> I bet
[1:24:47] <BritishTyrannosaur> psaGief
[1:24:48] <DeltaPangaea> Saving those RE5 people
[1:24:49] <killr0ckstars> call yr mom
[1:24:52] <rytisone> hoes mad
[1:24:53] <%Aeoneth> and an axe
[1:24:53] <gentlemanboxer> Ahoy ahoy
[1:25:00] <+notkojima> at least the pill makes that shorter
[1:25:03] <+The_Butterfly_Man> I really wished you could get the axe back some how
[1:25:04] <DantesAnimus> speaking as a southerner...Zoe's accent is the worst one in the game.
[1:25:04] <%ClericOfSparda> I still can't believe that [spoilers] gives you a bad ending
[1:25:07] <heart_ablaze> also eathan call 911 you stupid fuck
[1:25:09] <JayEarly> ya realleh shouldn’t ave come eeah
[1:25:09] <skyentombment> @ChoculaUltra well if I had just knocked out the missus I'd be downright giddy too HURHURHURHURHUR
[1:25:09] <+evbites> @ChoculaUltra more credits to my divorce theory
[1:25:10] <ChoculaUltra> calling it, RE8 is going reveal Ethan is one of Wesker's clone kids.
[1:25:10] <%Roasted_Pheasant> psaGief psaGiefrail
[1:25:11] <+mmack093> I bet Chris shoots Mia to make sure Ethan continues the baker bloodline with Zoey
[1:25:13] <evan623> she was the blood all along
[1:25:22] <GhostAnimals> @BallerSwagBro9k It feels like Capcom couldn't decide if they wanted him to be Leon Kennedy or Gordon Freeman
[1:25:33] <DeltaPangaea> Yeah, Ethan as one of the Wesker kids would make sense.
[1:25:36] <mellorolo> @candidecamera that would be sick if they shoe-horned her into the game like that!
[1:25:36] <%Meekest> Did he open the drawer?
[1:25:36] <BritishTyrannosaur> @choculaultra legit would like that twist
[1:25:39] <DantesAnimus> it sounds like bad fake cokney
[1:25:40] <%TigerCatGo> SPOOOOKY
[1:25:40] <$RealThiele> dumbest cop ever
[1:25:49] <@SoFarFetched> its like going back to the basics for Pat when playing RE games.
[1:25:50] <+Dannzzyy> This game is awesome.
[1:25:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> fuse
[1:25:51] <smuggleruncle> re is wierdly cozy
[1:25:52] <%Meekest> The cop in this game IS THE WORST
[1:25:53] <killr0ckstars> fetch the bolt cutters
[1:25:53] <0rond> yeah the whole endings thing really feels like the writer's self sense of morality that has not reason to affect the plot whatsoever
[1:25:55] <%ToneBacas> they're the sweet respite from the horrors of real life
[1:25:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> oh hi Mark
[1:25:57] <+mechslayer71> I feel the same
[1:25:58] <+MelodyMedley> Gotta scare ya
[1:25:59] <%linSP> but jake was the weaker child
[1:26:00] <cerellium> theyre just goofin around
[1:26:00] <%Dualities> does the puppy have an AC blasting right on him if its super hot there?
[1:26:00] <%Mr_Pylon> Ethan not dwelling on hacking an axe into his wife at all is still weird.
[1:26:07] <$joylent_blue> huh, looking up Ethan's face on google, and i wasnt expecting him to be blond for some reason
[1:26:08] <%CrookedSpiral> intense weapon bob
[1:26:09] <+notkojima> @choculaultra Ethan W(int)e(r)sker(s) IT WAS SO OBVIOUS Kreygasm
[1:26:12] <%Sendrak70> @PatStaresAt Did you see the new DbD killer sneak peak? Looks to be either a wolfman or Mr.Hyde.
[1:26:12] <BallerSwagBro9k> OMG that cop NotLikeThis
[1:26:16] <%ClericOfSparda> She slowly walked by the door then booked it so you wouldn't catch up to her
[1:26:19] <Aydarkzero> you all ever just play re2 one night and chill through the whole game while killing zombies
[1:26:21] <%ssjklyco> Ethan should have probably passed out from all his wounds
[1:26:22] <DraxTD> hay Pat, why we back in this EVIL Residence?
[1:26:22] <+nothollowyet> hey chat which difficulty is he doing?
[1:26:25] <+Dannzzyy> This was a fresh of breath air to play.
[1:26:28] <%JumboCrunchies> Whats wrong with her NOSE
[1:26:30] <Talfri> Ethan's writing is pretty inconsistent
[1:26:36] <skyentombment> @SoFarFetched The basics BUH BUH BUH BUH basics
[1:26:38] <+Pendragwn> @Sendrak70 what if it's both
[1:26:39] <Talfri> @nothollowyet normal
[1:26:39] <LoneFonte> normal, i think
[1:26:41] <+veraverse> Things are about to get...OUT OF HAND
[1:26:45] <Dr_Mooose> owww
[1:26:46] <@SoFarFetched> Wow he got SCREWED OVER BY HER
[1:26:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> Quick Suplex her!
[1:26:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> well at least my hand is okay
[1:26:48] <+nothollowyet> thz
[1:26:49] <ChoculaUltra> A regular person would definitely be woozy from the blood loss and shock. BUT A WESKER CLONE KID?! IDK MAN.
[1:26:51] <Dao_Puppy> God I hope that's not the jerkin' hand.
[1:26:53] <%ssjklyco> We call this an Alabama Screw Driver
[1:26:54] <Aydarkzero> Mia where did you get that chainsaw!?
[1:26:55] <%Huntercd> Safe words are important
[1:26:55] <+notkojima> it's okay hand we'll get out of this
[1:26:55] <%Rekinsinn> wow, i never knew how many puzzle assets were recycled from RE7
[1:26:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> just a little bottole of oh shit
[1:26:56] <VritraReiRei> Is there something on her nose? That's not normal right?
[1:26:57] <%FacetiousAF> screwdriver might come in handy
[1:26:57] <revoltingimp> BEEEeeeeeeeeeeetch
[1:26:58] <gentlemanboxer> bawkGun bawkGun bawkGun
[1:26:59] <+SoaringTrumpet> oh shit
[1:26:59] <GhostAnimals> @nothollowyet He's playing on No AC heatwave difficulty
[1:27:00] <+Arkfyre> this is some wild foreplay
[1:27:00] <$RealThiele> he is suddenly very weak
[1:27:00] <SpaceGuntank> isnt that the SAME hand too ? LUL
[1:27:00] <mrslappyboi2020> Youre "Screwed"
[1:27:01] <DianaTheAscian> eathans left hand eats so much shit
[1:27:03] <BallerSwagBro9k> BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[1:27:07] <SixxMakaveli> Perfect Healthy Relationship
[1:27:07] <+JVolfram> Screw you
[1:27:08] <+gimmickypizza> Clone kid
[1:27:10] <+evbites> re7 or abused husband simulator
[1:27:10] <%Agami23> maybe he's in shock
[1:27:10] <@SoFarFetched> Bet he never "saw" that coming Kappa
[1:27:11] <metalsiren31> He should be passing out
[1:27:12] <rytisone> he did
[1:27:12] <+Zutrax> Fighting her is the hardest part of the hardest difficulty playthrough, it's a nightmare.
[1:27:14] <%cylish> mighta gone straight into shock
[1:27:14] <Lutre> nah he's used to it, women be crazy
[1:27:15] <+StooEsq> don't you have to pay extra for an Alabama Screw Driver?
[1:27:15] <heart_ablaze> he did
[1:27:15] <ChoculaUltra> he's not even screaming!
[1:27:15] <skyentombment> HA, the witch cackle
[1:27:16] <$joylent_blue> he kinda did, a little bit
[1:27:17] <gentlemanboxer> Salty ian't she
[1:27:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> he just screamed
[1:27:18] <bookofmouths> he should probably be passing out
[1:27:18] <+gnoame> He seems Stumped as to what to do
[1:27:18] <Dr_Mooose> rub some dirt on it
[1:27:18] <%Rekinsinn> adrenalin's a hell of a drug
[1:27:19] <+MelodyMedley> Ouch
[1:27:20] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> Hate it when my girl moves all my tools around on my desk
[1:27:21] <ninjaguiden> She's getting the coffemaker!
[1:27:21] <+JVolfram> This is some kinky foreplay
[1:27:25] <$dalmek> quick, juice it
[1:27:27] <%CrookedSpiral> big squirts
[1:27:29] <+notkojima> put it in ur mouth
[1:27:31] <%ScottishMadJacko> I feel like ethan liked his left hand too much and shes jealous
[1:27:31] <%MidnightBurst12> that's alot of blood ouside of his body
[1:27:31] <+veraverse> But he screamed
[1:27:31] <%Nupinoop296> ouchie
[1:27:32] <%kyh9> Yes, Ethan is really non-chalant
[1:27:32] <BallerSwagBro9k> HE SHOULD BE PASSED OU IN SECONDS
[1:27:32] <%afronooch> splort splort
[1:27:33] <skyentombment> Mia legit just went ACK ACK ACK
[1:27:33] <$RealThiele> it was just a booty call
[1:27:33] <rytisone> you've been disarmed
[1:27:34] <%FacetiousAF> time to apply the coconut water
[1:27:35] <%Dementedpenguin> All good. 4Head
[1:27:36] <heart_ablaze> stumpy
[1:27:37] <absentking> MUST CONTAIN OUTBREAK
[1:27:38] <shruke> this family sure has a lot of tools lying around
[1:27:40] <+SkaiVibration> GROSS
[1:27:40] <skyentombment> ALL BETTER
[1:27:41] <CandideCamera> people give the game too much credit saying "oh Ethan's a secret badass so tough", Ethan just doesn't react to anything ever
[1:27:41] <%SirGO0SE> all better :)
[1:27:42] <+Dannzzyy> Yea they used a lot of the re7 assists in remake 2/3.
[1:27:42] <DraxTD> now your stumpy
[1:27:42] <Aydarkzero> ah fast healing
[1:27:42] <+ALazo> it's k just screw it back in
[1:27:42] <ChoculaUltra> he is way too fucking chill rn
[1:27:44] <Lutre> gotta moisten that stump
[1:27:46] <%linSP> just a flesh wound
[1:27:46] <+MelodyMedley> Put it on the stump!
[1:27:47] <%ssjklyco> Caulderized with herbs
[1:27:47] <Chatterbox1991> Fun Fact: you were originally going to be bisected at the midsection and have to crawl around with youur guts falling out
[1:27:48] <GhostAnimals> Losing the hand has gotta lead to shock
[1:27:49] <faithless_zealot> I'm no medical expert, but ... can't that easily kill you?
[1:27:49] <%kyh9> surprisingly non-chalant
[1:27:50] <%Birdigalore> Sanitizes and cauterizes!
[1:27:52] <DeltaPangaea> Yeah he gets over losing a hand pretty quick
[1:27:52] <%afronooch> PUT IT AWAY LUL
[1:27:52] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt I think he got infected by the mold already
[1:27:54] <mrslappyboi2020> Itll grow back
[1:27:55] <%hermitsen> need a hand?
[1:27:56] <%happyface699> Just staple it on
[1:27:56] <+JVolfram> I gotta hand it to you
[1:27:58] <$RealThiele> only tiny splurt
[1:27:58] <0rond> why does she cackle
[1:28:01] <0rond> hua hua hua
[1:28:02] <%Taisuru> He should push button with stump
[1:28:03] <%Huntercd> That would hurt so bad
[1:28:03] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> That seems way further down his arm than just the wrist
[1:28:04] <Aydarkzero> i guess Ethan was really stumped on why she did that Kappa
[1:28:06] <ahaegotrigger> True
[1:28:08] <Mr_Strut> Why did it stop the bleeding?
[1:28:09] <@SoFarFetched> Ethan's gotta "hand" it to Mia on cutting it off
[1:28:09] <+notkojima> @dannzzyy I marked out for the yellow tape in the RPD
[1:28:17] <%Birdigalore> Quick, fuck it while you have the chance
[1:28:18] <%Strider222> did he stop the bleeding with the juice?
[1:28:18] <DeltaPangaea> The first aid water is made from herbs, isn't it?
[1:28:20] <BallerSwagBro9k> GUYS PLZ NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:28:22] <%ScottishMadJacko> I always thought this was rad cause id never seen a game do anything like this
[1:28:22] <+lordericter> goopy poopy comin out of that stump
[1:28:23] <+mmack093> It's meaty and he' hungry
[1:28:23] <+evbites> @0rond EVIE
[1:28:26] <0rond> all better now
[1:28:26] <JayEarly> @mr_strut herb juice
[1:28:27] <DeltaPangaea> And RE herbs are explicitly superhealing
[1:28:27] <$RealThiele> vitamin water is powerful
[1:28:34] <%gus_hornblende> gus_hornblende subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 14 months! zambos
[1:28:34] <bookofmouths> GUN
[1:28:34] <+Dives__> @Mr_Strut Resident Evil herb juice is powerful
[1:28:37] <ha2ken> GUN
[1:28:39] <%chronotriggerhappy123> special herb juice cures all wounds
[1:28:40] <bluefooddye1> The greatest handgun ever made
[1:28:41] <mastertwin2> That thing should look WAY more fucked up from a chainsaw injury
[1:28:42] <%Dementedpenguin> G U N
[1:28:42] <%cylish> kinda a missed opportunity to create gameplay revolving around missing a hand
[1:28:43] <What1sgoingon> how does he reload then
[1:28:44] <Ookamiden02> How is he holding the lantern btw?
[1:28:46] <heart_ablaze> I sear the puns in chat are getting out of hand
[1:28:47] <$joylent_blue> alright the next person to make a hand pun gets it pvpSlay
[1:28:47] <gentlemanboxer> My good ball scratching hand
[1:28:47] <BallerSwagBro9k> GUN GOT
[1:28:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> Welcome to the south HAVE A GUN
[1:28:51] <ChoculaUltra> sounds like this isn't the first time he's handled a gun with a response like that
[1:28:53] <Talfri> He somehow reloads with one hand
[1:28:54] <aeriflame> let's break up
[1:28:54] <%happyface699> GUN
[1:28:55] <0rond> yeah it's way too clean cut
[1:28:55] <%ScottishMadJacko> His reload is impressive
[1:28:55] <+notkojima> can I, shoot you a question?
[1:28:57] <+gnoame> Hey he does TECHNICALLY have two hands
[1:28:58] <@SoFarFetched> Oh no Ethan is gonna gun it towards Mia
[1:29:00] <%Xevtes> @PatStaresAt Ethan better have scars on his left hand in RE8
[1:29:01] <rytisone> aim it sideways like Leon
[1:29:01] <+Ancopro> Like Mista
[1:29:02] <DeltaPangaea> Ethan just be like "Okay fine fuck you"
[1:29:05] <Talfri> he just puts the magazine on top of his stump
[1:29:05] <BallerSwagBro9k> @Ookamiden02 His massive penis
[1:29:05] <aeriflame> it's not you, it's MIA
[1:29:06] <0rond> he reloads like nero does
[1:29:06] <KaiserMario> Like Big Boss
[1:29:07] <$RealThiele> if this was real america he would have 3 guns already
[1:29:09] <%king_wragles> Very slowly, that's how
[1:29:10] <%Jaysky> cirCop
[1:29:11] <SirKeigan> Stump man
[1:29:12] <%GeneralSCPatton> The herb juice is only so good because Ethan's infected already.
[1:29:12] <Aydarkzero> he reloads the same way game charatcers reload dual wielding weapons at the same time Kappa
[1:29:12] <+notkojima> gunvorce
[1:29:14] <%Agami23> hey pat, some great old one shit just got tweeted on twitter by an observatory. 2020 going wild
[1:29:16] <%twoto858> I love Ethan specifically because he's an everyman in a series full of bizarre characters
[1:29:17] <%Meekest> You only have one shot at it
[1:29:18] <very_ap3> with the strength of herbs in the RE series im surprised it doesnt just straight up cure the viruses
[1:29:20] <SirKeigan> Who here never played this?
[1:29:22] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> Ethan's reaction to this whole sequence makes me think this isnt the first domestic dispute in the Winters' house
[1:29:26] <skyentombment> So, here's the thing: Why does Ethan never lose another appendage in the game, considering how he gets attacked with all sorts of shit?
[1:29:27] <%ssjklyco> He has two hand holes on the same hand
[1:29:29] <%nothollowyet> nothollowyet subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! RE7 is the hardest Platinum trophy I've ever done next to Dark Souls Remastered but what a great game. Here's some Bezos bucks for your AC.
[1:29:32] <+The_Butterfly_Man> your playing as ethan in 8 right?
[1:29:33] <+NitronStreams> Ethan should be absolutely fucked up by the end of this game
[1:29:34] <%ScottishMadJacko> DUde, what will they do to his hand in Re8
[1:29:35] <aeriflame> this was my first RE game and its my favourite
[1:29:36] <rytisone> damn boxes
[1:29:40] <mellorolo> His face is the gun and the gun is divorce
[1:29:47] <+notkojima> retribution strikes again
[1:29:57] <GhostAnimals> Could you seriously imagine getting back together with someone after THIS? Even with the mind control?
[1:29:59] <JayEarly> nice trigger discipline
[1:30:01] <Aydarkzero> @The_Butterfly_Man looks like it
[1:30:01] <+Pendragwn> @very_ap3 In one of the movies they do have a cure, but once the mutations get out of hand they can't really unfuck you unless you turned into a dinosaur
[1:30:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ScottishMadJacko it still hasn't been flayed and eaten
[1:30:03] <ChoculaUltra> Ethan brought his divorce lawyer. It's a shovel in the trunk of his car LUL
[1:30:04] <MassConnect> Zach would have just had a gun arm
[1:30:05] <Talfri> @skyentombment he's almost guaranteed to be infected by the Mold, which grants regenerative ability
[1:30:05] <skyentombment> @Agami23 You got a link for this poor peasant?
[1:30:08] <+MelodyMedley> Playing this in VR makes it so much worse
[1:30:09] <TheHylianGuard> Mama Mia
[1:30:09] <%Neryl_> @Agami23 wha
[1:30:11] <heartlesshealer> no escape for Ethan
[1:30:15] <DeltaPangaea> To be fair, every RE protag should be massively fucked up by the end of their game.
[1:30:17] <Aydarkzero> augh
[1:30:17] <+evbites> i'm trying you dumb bitch
[1:30:19] <@SoFarFetched> YOU NEVER SAW HER COMINGGGG
[1:30:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> because he was a cop
[1:30:22] <+TheeJelman> what do we think of them using ethan again in re8?
[1:30:24] <Talfri> Mia does say some interesting things in this sequence
[1:30:25] <Dr_Mooose> blap
[1:30:26] <%Meekest> What does THAT line mean
[1:30:26] <%ScottishMadJacko> Remember blocking the chainsaw iis more effective than you think
[1:30:27] <absentking> YO\
[1:30:28] <Talfri> in regards to Ethan
[1:30:31] <aeriflame> never heard that line
[1:30:32] <%Roasted_Pheasant> Just kill wife 4Head
[1:30:34] <gentlemanboxer> Consider that a divorce
[1:30:35] <+sp_abadidea> Ethan has *really* steady aim and recoil control for a guy missing a hand
[1:30:35] <aeriflame> "always watching me"
[1:30:38] <+Pendragwn> @GhostAnimals but what if her pussy SLAPS
[1:30:40] <ChoculaUltra> Ethan doesn't even try to talk her down at this point.

[1:38:23] <+mmack093> Didn't pat say he'd eat someone if they consented before death?
[1:38:24] <BallerSwagBro9k> That clip always makes me laugh
[1:38:24] <+notkojima> @skyentombment also none of his trophies are first place. showing that he's brilliant but giving him an implied chip on his shoulder that would really fuck with someone like him
[1:38:25] <theGameFriendtv> whataburger cup in the trash can
[1:38:25] <Deimos002> "What's all this aboot?" -a Canadian
[1:38:26] <0rond> @PatStaresAt doesn't grandma turn her head towards you?
[1:38:26] <Thewoodentree> Fly lands on forehead
[1:38:28] <Iwashi94> why is it so dark
[1:38:29] <GhostAnimals> Lucas is a master creep because one of the messages implies he was Jerkin the Gherkin while spying on his sister
[1:38:29] <+jrogers629> It'd be a 2 for one you get to beat elderly person and a child all at once.

[1:38:47] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> Must be creole. All these mixed ingredients. Not like good old fashioned cajun
[1:38:57] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @joylent_blue is rev2 happening?
[1:38:57] <%Mr_Pylon> So I guess in the RE world the green herb is everywhere enough that conventional healing would just become 'put some juice on there'
[1:38:57] <@SoFarFetched> @SaltkeyAndAckfish He's finishing up that RE marathon he was doing before the release of RE3make. REV2 is still on hold because paige's butt is broken so he's moving on to RE7 to get it out of the way.
[1:38:58] <Gallhint> the grandma follows you
[1:38:58] <Aydarkzero> they must have a lot of dogs
[1:39:03] <%TigerCatGo> creepy

[1:51:59] <aeriflame> is it me or is "hell of a girl" a really weird thing to say about a complete stranger you only know because of a phone call
[1:52:02] <%Schrodingers_Box> Jack's brother should have been named Bill instead, because he saves Zoey
[1:52:03] <%ClutchRoadagain> Jack looked super skinny
[1:52:03] <haitakaa> hell of a squirrel
[1:52:03] <very_ap3> God that door is so ridiculous
[1:52:05] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @PettyFunk Having short hair in the Woolie Swamp makes you a target
[1:52:08] <+Grayhammatter> how could we possibly do it?
[1:52:09] <indig0bird> I hope she comes back
[1:52:12] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, the underground African herbs kickstarted all of Umbrella's pharmacy stuff
[1:52:14] <DeltaPangaea> I like to think that the minor exposure to the viruses has slowly made RE protags like Chris super juiced.

[1:53:19] <%Nomad_Scholar> He's a police officer, not a civil servant
[1:53:20] <+Dives__> He thinks you're on drugs and Louisiana police aren't the best
[1:53:22] <Iwashi94> Ethan isn't the brightest
[1:53:23] <%Jaysky> A cop would never give their gun
[1:53:23] <$RealThiele> cause according to the supreme court, cops do not have to protect or serve
[1:53:25] <ninjaguiden> Can we not spam that shit constantly?
[1:53:25] <+YabbaTroll> i think its a joke about past resident evil games
[1:53:26] <+Walopoh> When your stupid desparate
[1:53:27] <+BIumen> i'm glad ethan appealed to his.....uh, Greed
[1:53:28] <%ssjklyco> Show him your arm staples
[1:53:35] <indig0bird> 40% of cops...
[1:53:35] <CrypticMochi> Has he been missing long enough to be a missing person?
[1:53:38] <%juxtest> Show him the staples holding your hand on if he doesn't believe you
[1:53:39] <%ClericOfSparda> Seriously, asking a cop for his gun was a dumb idea. He's lucky he got the knife.
[1:53:39] <$Afterman_> blackc ops get it the worst in resident evil
[1:53:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> This guy is unambiguously a stupid asshole
[1:53:40] <TheChapyGuy> he's really generous for even doing that
[1:53:42] <TheCoolestRyker> Did STARS do anything before RE1?
[1:53:42] <SirKeigan> Is this cop a bastard?
[1:53:43] <benjehuda> Stab people, duh

[1:54:08] <%Agami23> hey so for more emphasis that something is fucked up with ethan, he just stabbed a box into literal pieces
[1:54:09] <%Th3SmartAlec> Marvin is spinning in his irradiated grave
[1:54:10] <Thewoodentree> Here comes teleporting Jack
[1:54:11] <TheCoolestRyker> Pog
[1:54:13] <+BIumen> yeah is STARS a national thing?
[1:54:13] <BritishTyrannosaur> now you can do sick style combos
[1:54:14] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @Aydarkzero While Ethan was eating mold, I studied tEH bLADe
[1:54:15] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> Yes finally a 3 inch knife. Now I can punch this box open

[1:54:54] <+Dives__> Driving the car is my favorite way to do this
[1:54:56] <Dr_Mooose> big ass axe
[1:54:57] <%damienlunas> Fastest way to do this is to get in the car and let him pull you out right

[1:55:08] <skyentombment> Is it just me or is it weird that this gun is completely square in the back?
[1:55:11] <heartlesshealer> So the deputy's body would have absolutely lurched forward during the shovel slice, but whatever, videogames
[1:55:19] <DeltaPangaea> Yeah, I'm gonna be honest I way WAY prefer campy non-serious Resident Evil over 'Haha time for visceral gore-horror'
[1:55:19] <+Walopoh> Adamantium shovel
[1:55:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> @circular7 Hard disagree, he only agreed to help Ethan protect himself once Ethan appealed to him saying it would make him look like a hero

[2:02:24] <%SirGO0SE> the thing that kills me in these games is why the protags dont jump out of the window.

[2:03:59] <Thewoodentree> @SaltkeyAndAckfish ah
[2:04:08] <ChoculaUltra> I need to know who set up these elaborate shadow puzzles because it seems way too tame for Lucas.
[2:04:10] <SainEdge> there also is a book in the living room, written by O'brian, the BSAA boss from revelations 1
[2:04:10] <xxshadowxx416> pat doe not think

[2:04:27] <%SirGO0SE> @Scorilla_ i mean, its easier to remove boards than find keys, right? hes got a pocket knife too. i get why its the way that it is and definitely not exclusive to this game
[2:04:32] <+ConLin_Arts_> Belmont?

[2:04:50] <%crimsonharvest> It's extremely early 70s in so many ways it like being in my grandma's house
[2:04:51] <+Dunnesparce> George Trevor designed the Spencer Mansion right?
[2:04:51] <Daebunz> i still sometimes rewatch paige doing the puzzle and giggle. same with the baba videos

[2:05:03] <andresisant> shoot ér
[2:05:03] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt I wonder how much evil architects make
[2:05:04] <PirateMike_> This house looks like a plantation house from the slave era
[2:05:06] <+AXL808> shoot
[2:05:06] <BallerSwagBro9k> Wouldnt that make the house a tourist attarction tho?
[2:05:09] <RoyallyFlushed> you gotta start with building weird regular houses before you get jobs to build weird mansions
[2:05:09] <xanderfist> she magic
[2:05:10] <unclekulikov> uman there's some heavy themes in this game.
[2:05:10] <%Birdigalore> Should be able to pop her for early credits, Far Cry style
[2:05:13] <skyentombment> daddy's hobby uwu
[2:05:14] <%linSP> end it now
[2:05:15] <+American_Saikyo> what about the Son? He is a genius, he couldve done all the goofy shit in the house
[2:05:16] <Reckless_Rob> Why does he call him daddy?
[2:05:17] <Scorilla_> @SirGO0SE yeah true lol but RE is of course known for its smart characters who make very logical decisions
[2:05:17] <DraxTD> please have Paige solve the SHADOW Puzzle... for she is the bestest at it
[2:05:18] <%AngriestAngryArtist> RE engine props!
[2:05:18] <+YPFrost> hellow gamers
[2:05:19] <%crimsonharvest> although I'm VERY skeptical about the lack of carpets in here, carpet was how you proved you weren't poor when this house was built
[2:05:32] <ChoculaUltra> ngl, all these Umbrella built properties are p nice minus all the bioweaponry and insane families trying to kill you.
[2:05:34] <+evbites> @Thewoodentree not enough those guys are great
[2:05:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> did I hear Zoe
[2:05:52] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> chat what happens if you shoot the grandma?
[2:05:57] <Thewoodentree> @evbites LUL
[2:06:00] <ChoculaUltra> Definite house flipping potential
[2:06:02] <PirateMike_> Indeed
[2:06:05] <$joylent_blue> Paige might be a bit busy with the dog, guys
[2:06:06] <Talfri> This property isn't umbrella built, no?
[2:06:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> nothing you can't @SaltkeyAndAckfish
[2:06:09] <RoyallyFlushed> @SaltkeyAndAckfish you can't
[2:06:10] <$dalmek> @SaltkeyAndAckfish game doesn't let you
[2:06:12] <+xeros720> games prevents you from killing her
[2:06:15] <KeystoneA2> @SaltkeyAndAckfish It won't let you.
[2:06:16] <%Birdigalore> Only poop when it's turtling
[2:06:16] <CrowbarFacelift> !Bad Advice!
[2:06:17] <%ToneBacas> i would assume carpet would get gross, as opposed to hardwood
[2:06:17] <%PettyFunk> @crimsonharvest Would you want much carpeting in a hot humid wet swampy bayou?
[2:06:18] <DantesAnimus> go to the railing to watch bug mom
[2:06:19] <%AzureGale> Words NOT to live by
[2:06:19] <SainEdge> big coward
[2:06:22] <PirateMike_> I hear its bad to hold it in tho
[2:06:22] <+evbites> Pat thats how you got gout
[2:06:22] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> ok ty everyone LUL
[2:06:30] <rytisone> just cash in that huge poop damage
[2:06:37] <%ssjklyco> Ouch
[2:06:38] <ChoculaUltra> If it's not an Umbrella built mansion, it definitely got the vibes of the Spencer spot.
[2:06:41] <DantesAnimus> eh too late
[2:06:42] <ShoMibu> igaDuck oh replying this huh.
[2:06:46] <unclekulikov> DA RULE?
[2:06:47] <heartlesshealer> not umbrella built, but son was in contact
[2:06:51] <$RealThiele> bitch you cut off my hand
[2:06:51] <+evbites> what up it's ya gurl mia coming to ya from da bayou
[2:06:54] <circular7> remember when you got gout pat, we do
[2:06:57] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt I cheesed it with the video I ran over after triggering him and he disappears when you pop the tape in
[2:07:01] <ChoculaUltra> Ah that makes sense
[2:07:01] <Thewoodentree> And thats why Ethan trades up for Zoey
[2:07:03] <DivineMessiah> chat is there any difference between replying and @ someone?
[2:07:15] <Talfri> some of the mouth animations in this game get wonky
[2:07:18] <Thewoodentree> @DivineMessiah nah
[2:07:20] <%tigerfang86> not the DEMON DUBZ
[2:07:21] <%nothollowyet> VHS was so much better than bluray. having agency over the camera like this DxCat
[2:07:21] <%crimsonharvest> @PettyFunk that's part of the flex, affording to clean and cool the house
[2:07:22] <%tigerfang86> BUGZ
[2:07:23] <$Solid_Stro> I wonder if there’s some Let’s Plays of this game with people questioning what a VHS tape is.
[2:07:24] <JigsK> w-where did she put the camera
[2:07:27] <+Grayhammatter> how do bug do?
[2:07:27] <+axamilli> does pat have his first resident evil 7 playthrough on youtube?

[2:07:50] <%barrakuta371> I was just gonna ask if those were actually hallucinations
[2:07:52] <$dalmek> @DivineMessiah if you hover over the replied-to person's name, you can see their message too
[2:07:52] <RoyallyFlushed> this tape is wired into Mia's brain, clearly

[2:07:54] <scrumbotime> Well you see, he's hallucinating the contents of the tape
[2:07:56] <%PettyFunk> @DivineMessiah Not really but it's cool seeing what the person is replying to for context

[2:08:53] <+AXL808> it still amazes me how Capcom was willing to make this bold and risky change for RE
[2:08:56] <%SirGO0SE> shadow puzzles
[2:09:00] <skyentombment> This reminds me of a thing an ex gf of mine did in high school, where we had a fight and she straight up sent me a pptx later in the day to kind of present her apology in convenient bullet points
[2:09:09] <%crimsonharvest> huh i dont remember the flashback scanlines being visible on stream before
[2:09:11] <ChoculaUltra> no one cares about your shitty house, Marge.
[2:09:15] <Thewoodentree> I love evil buildings as a concept

[2:10:50] <skyentombment> @SaltkeyAndAckfish It was kind of weirdly impersonal and unorthodox, but it was. Too bad we broke up because she discovered she was a lesbian
[2:10:51] <Reckless_Rob> What WAS left?
[2:10:51] <+evbites> @SlappyMeats Ethan was the one shouting

[2:19:37] <+skylerpilot> @Afterman_ I wasn't under the impression that the mold / Evie was directly controlling them at all times. I think they are more under its influence most of the time rather than "control" and are more like hostages. Which could be worse depending on how you think / feel about it
[2:19:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> @huntercd Remember that time Boomhauer saw Hank's cocaine fishbait, and seemed to recognize it but let it slide because he knows Hank is innocent and naive?

[2:27:20] <PirateMike_> Has paige ever eaten homemade mustard?
[2:27:35] <$RealThiele> thats very specific
[2:27:39] <+evbites> just lame lickers and stretchy zombies
[2:27:43] <rytisone> where nothing bad ever happens
[2:27:52] <Aydarkzero> while the Mold are pretty lame i do like them for this game just seemed like they cornered themselves in terms of enemy variety
[2:28:14] <heartlesshealer> It does. And I never want to see it again
[2:28:16] <Aydarkzero> lmao
[2:28:18] <Talfri> yeah I hope they increase the variety in RE8
[2:28:25] <$RealThiele> nah you couldve done posseser molded, zombie semi-molded, and licker molded
[2:28:42] <ShoMibu> pc port?
[2:28:43] <Aydarkzero> re8 should be wild w/ the Duchess squad though
[2:28:49] <+evbites> they need to stick with remake zombie tech

[2:30:01] <%Garthunox> Pat when is Paige gonna play Indigo Prophecy and Omikron?
[2:30:02] <%ClutchRoadagain> It killed someone just not who you wanted
[2:30:04] <KaiserMario> Pat can play this in his sleep, huh?
[2:30:07] <+skylerpilot> @heartlesshealer way before, Last of Us is a ps3 game
[2:30:10] <rytisone> blade arms have more health
[2:30:12] <Ell1ot> is the AC still broken?
[2:30:18] <skyentombment> PAIGE MUST PLAY OMIKRON
[2:30:22] <$RealThiele> !AC
[2:30:24] <heartlesshealer> okay then yeah, probably avoiding legal crap and went with boring mold types
[2:30:24] <haitakaa> I feel like the same thing happened in their old LP
[2:30:37] <%Fooguwu> i cant believe they made paige's lunch an antagonist in re7
[2:30:43] <+lordericter> nah the huge arm gives him more health
[2:30:45] <skyentombment> Oh, also, GOOOOO TELL AUNT ROOOOOODIEEEE
[2:30:47] <%king_wragles> Well, I don't know how to read
[2:30:48] <%nimu290> paige didn't eat the mold fast enough
[2:30:49] <+evbites> @heartlesshealer i think this was around the time people were tired of zombies
[2:30:50] <ninjaguiden> Serious question, why are you so often way up in monster faces @PatStaresAt ? Especially when you often joke about Paige facefucking things
[2:30:57] <$floralkami> @skyentombment are you TRYING to get her killed?
[2:31:06] <Aydarkzero> i only made enhanced ammo if i had it
[2:31:09] <+trashcansan> Pat, when are you going to get some pasties so you can turn your cam on again?
[2:31:14] <+ConLin_Arts_> the Tell Aunt Rodie song for this game was pretty good
[2:31:14] <%nimu290> it grew violet
[2:31:16] <+evbites> Did anyone else watch that zombie romance movie called warm bodies
[2:31:31] <+ConLin_Arts_> saw bits of it
[2:31:40] <$RealThiele> dodged it thanksfully
[2:31:40] <%doc_ock_rokc> @evbites to be fair EVERYTHING wa szombies at this point in time
[2:31:41] <+trashcansan> warm bodies is an okay movie
[2:31:44] <%Huntercd> I would sub to pat's just for fans
[2:31:46] <skyentombment> That makes it twice that Pat died already, correct?
[2:31:50] <Aydarkzero> never saw that movie, stranger that i heard nothing about it though
[2:31:50] <heartlesshealer> @evbites That could be it too. I never played much zombie stuff so I might not have noticed how saturated the market was at the time
[2:31:56] <+gatoralus> Did pats new good boy break the cam
[2:32:01] <$floralkami> @evbites i did, by accident if you can believe. it was okay. not as bad as twilight, at least
[2:32:04] <Aydarkzero> ! ACCURACY AT RISK !
[2:32:06] <@SoFarFetched> AC broken again
[2:32:10] <+BoomerTiro> I dont rememeber this guy taking this many bullets
[2:32:14] <+evbites> Also never forget that orbit the gum says it's ok to fuck zombies
[2:32:14] <$RealThiele> his balls are in his arm
[2:32:16] <rytisone> Travis touched down
[2:32:17] <gooseonstilts> 50% hit rate
[2:32:18] <skyentombment> @Huntercd just for fans? not onlyfans? Pat uses the family value version?
[2:32:23] <%Aeoneth> because RE Balance director at play?
[2:32:25] <Darknaturexd> cuz ya aim not good
[2:32:25] <Monkey_D_Judd> Thats what happens when you miss every other shot
[2:32:30] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt It's almost like they gave you stuff to make stronger ammo?
[2:32:31] <%R3Roundabout> The wall kept stealing your bullets
[2:32:36] <haitakaa> this handgun feels like a bb gun
[2:32:39] <%PettyFunk> His pee is stored in his arms?
[2:32:46] <$RealThiele> LUL no that wrong
[2:32:47] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> Balls stored in the arm
[2:32:48] <QuadradoMacio> big arms mean bigger health
[2:32:53] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat should get Paige to play as Joe Baker
[2:32:59] <CreepyUncleCross> 0/10 stream no zangief
[2:33:02] <$RealThiele> oh god hes gonna shoot the arm isnt he
[2:33:05] <Aydarkzero> if i recall this Handgun isn't anything special right?
[2:33:10] <heartlesshealer> elbow groin is not a fun image

[2:47:56] <+cocoapupstudios> resided evil
[2:47:56] <%maenos2> in your sleep huh
[2:47:57] <%happyface699> F
[2:47:58] <%PettyFunk> I like to think that Jack built those chainsaw scissors pre-mold, just because he thought it would be fun and cool
[2:47:59] <KingKZ> You got it alright
[2:48:00] <%thegalvanicpanic> psaHoldon I got it
[2:48:01] <%happyface699> adumF
[2:48:02] <bookofmouths> chems
[2:48:03] <+NitronStreams> Now for the real first try
[2:48:03] <Aydarkzero> we've seen stranger weapons!
[2:48:03] <GustauveVIII> you can go for the chainsaw at the same time he does pat
[2:48:04] <%lemon_rinds> This is a lesbian fight if I’ve ever seen one
[2:48:05] <mastermidget23> I've never seen that kill
[2:48:06] <%logoth_> I alt tabbed out during the basement death then I come back to see pat being murdered yet again
[2:48:06] <KaiserMario> FIRST T-R-Y
[2:48:06] <cipher758> ducktape the head back
[2:48:10] <%M3djedx> cosmoWink

[2:48:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> @agami23 Fucking sick
[2:48:22] <%Bt_Robot> ONE MAY EVEN SAY JACK IS AS BIG AS A CLOCKTOWER?
[2:48:23] <Aydarkzero> wasn't there a second floor to explore in the main hall?
[2:48:25] <dinnydanny777> Lewis probably built the chainsaw
[2:48:25] <Thewoodentree> RIP AND TEAR
[2:48:30] <PiotrRasputin> Is Pat replaying this because Capcom revealedi t's the best selling RE game now?
[2:48:31] <KaiserMario> And now, your ass is grass
[2:48:31] <+OwlLightningMage> Guys, Pat is awake right now. That's why he's sucking shit
[2:48:34] <%jjolion> This dude always misses
[2:48:37] <%happyface699> UNTIL IT IS DONE
[2:48:37] <skyentombment> I'm somewhat surprised these games never try to get some kind of product placement with Black and Decker or Leatherman on the tools
[2:48:39] <+mrgwontstrimmer> You need time stop
[2:48:42] <nerdtalkdan> The real question. How would Jill fare in this murder house
[2:48:45] <%ElkRiverDog> I can believe that Jack could withstand the kickback from the chainsaws locking but not Ethan
[2:48:46] <skyentombment> also GOOOOOO TELL AUNT ROOOOODIEEEEEE
[2:48:51] <tengel66> feels like Pat's energy/vibe is low, maybe it's due to no face cam. idk <3
[2:48:58] <%Mr_Pylon> that dinky kick is so funny
[2:48:59] <$RealThiele> eternal had too many non-wheel weapons
[2:49:00] <KingVantq> @PiotrRasputin finishing the RE marathon from earlier this yeaar
[2:49:02] <%Birdigalore> Knife is easier I swear
[2:49:06] <%lemon_rinds> @jjolion He’s got a boyfriend that doesn’t kiss him too
[2:49:10] <skyentombment> That's 10 Pat deaths by my count
[2:49:10] <dukenux> fuck Aunt Rhodie
[2:49:17] <%PettyFunk> Evil Dead 2 :)
[2:49:22] <%ScottishMadJacko> PAts struggling with the heat like the rest of us i think
[2:49:25] <derap41> HE SAID THE THING!
[2:49:31] <+bugz_munny> This is no longer groovy
[2:49:34] <+Pendragwn> @PiotrRasputin according to google DMC5 is the best selling Resident Evil game
[2:49:41] <%YakumoYomi> You wouldn't be dying this much if you played in VR psaSmug
[2:49:48] <+NitronStreams> Pat should get some advice from Pat I hear he's great at Resident Evil
[2:49:49] <PiotrRasputin> @Pendragwn Noted.
[2:49:53] <derap41> Man I haven't Watched Evil dead in forever
[2:49:55] <Thewoodentree> He even missed with the body bag
[2:49:56] <wibbwobbler> noice
[2:49:59] <KingKZ> 3 straight misses
[2:50:05] <Talfri> he was about to decapitate again
[2:50:08] <$RealThiele> Zenos just wants you to eat Hydaelyn so you 2 can fight
[2:50:13] <Paynexkiller> Hey Chat, why's Pat replaying Resident Evil 7? Any reason?
[2:50:23] <nerdtalkdan> Is this a no health item run or something?
[2:50:27] <TheCoolestRyker> Resident evil marathon
[2:50:29] <derap41> @Paynexkiller Are you joking?
[2:50:33] <KingVantq> finishing the RE marathon
[2:50:35] <rytisone> to prepare for RE3 Remake
[2:50:36] <+lordericter> pat certainly aims like he's asleep

[2:50:49] <dinnydanny777> Oof black fingernails
[2:50:50] <%Typhaeon> JAM IT IN
[2:50:52] <$RealThiele> RE7 is finishing the RE marathon for 3 remake, no face cause AC is broken ATM, game is normal mode
[2:50:53] <%ragingbrachy> "i dont think" - patrick boivin
[2:50:54] <Paynexkiller> Cheers.
[2:50:55] <%afronooch> POGRESS
[2:51:07] <derap41> he was gonna finish this by the Re 2 remake release right?
[2:51:10] <%PettyFunk> It's not even really Jack's weird bullshit, he was forced into the 'Father' role by Evelyn wasn't he?
[2:51:11] <PiotrRasputin> It's a shame Jack was never in a fighting game.. yet.
[2:51:14] <nerdtalkdan> Guy needs to dump some of that mysterious liquid on his hand then if it’s a regular run lol
[2:51:17] <+bugz_munny> GOLDEN RAYS OF THE GLORIOUS SUNSHINE
[2:51:22] <Paynexkiller> Jack4 Smash
[2:51:32] <%Typhaeon> Did you know you can press LB to guard?
[2:51:32] <ItsJustShawn> just a good ol fashioned chainsaw fight
[2:51:36] <PirateMike_> Can you just hold the attack button with the chainsaw?
[2:51:41] <PirateMike_> instead if swinging
[2:51:47] <ChoculaUltra> and the entire body bag, body and bag, explode into blood.
[2:51:48] <%Xooler67> @paynexkiller decided to continue the marathon but skip revelations 2 since Paige is fucked up
[2:52:09] <derap41> @Xooler67 And nothing of value was lost
[2:52:14] <%Birdigalore> LET GO, JUSTIN!
[2:52:20] <%Jaysky> An ARM break
[2:52:22] <%king_wragles> REV 2 will appear once everything is proper and ready
[2:52:29] <ChoculaUltra> Let time run out!

[2:52:43] <KaiserMario> Damn...

[2:52:44] <Dao_Puppy> We sure this is normal?
[2:52:44] <Talfri> I think you can just get in
[2:52:44] <mastermidget23> Is he on madhouse?
[2:52:45] <noyman2000> You really got this
[2:52:46] <Dr_Mooose> *countered
[2:52:47] <%happyface699> adumF adumF adumF
[2:52:49] <%Huntercd> !followage
[2:52:49] <circular7> pat says he can do this in his sleep, paige blames blames lack of sleep when sucks.
[2:52:50] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> it is
[2:52:52] <+buzz7788> F
[2:52:52] <%GraceTBM> @PatStaresAt you should be ducking his hits more
[2:52:53] <ethanjbennett> it is
[2:52:54] <%ragingbrachy> yeah
[2:52:55] <+BoomerTiro> Oh no, you ar doing way better
[2:52:56] <KingKZ> It is.
[2:52:56] <BlkFlameKami> TRUE
[2:52:57] <PiotrRasputin> Don't turn the cheat codes on Pat.
[2:52:57] <derap41> it is worse than when Paige did it
[2:52:58] <skyentombment> GOOOOO TELL AUNT ROOOOOOODIE
[2:52:58] <+Ilpala> IT SUPER IS
[2:52:58] <%cowardman93> first time you did it you did it in 2 tries
[2:52:59] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Does Pat not have any heals?
[2:52:59] <+bugz_munny> dayum
[2:52:59] <$RealThiele> it is
[2:52:59] <%nimu290> damn so close
[2:52:59] <Talfri> this is just normal difficulty
[2:53:00] <noyman2000> It is
[2:53:04] <KaiserMario> Pat, under the table in the cop room
[2:53:04] <nerdtalkdan> Everyone has a bad stream dude
[2:53:05] <Talfri> don't back away so much
[2:53:08] <%JD_Lars> Chem pack under table
[2:53:09] <skyentombment> 11 DEATHS
[2:53:10] <+mkenney24> are you out of heals?
[2:53:10] <circular7> it is
[2:53:11] <%Sendrak70> @PatStaresAt Your just showing us how people who arnt you play this game. You can start playing for real now.
[2:53:16] <+bugz_munny> eh happens
[2:53:16] <PirateMike_> bad
[2:53:17] <%ragingbrachy> i think you need a sleep
[2:53:18] <ninjaguiden> that is such a long fight
[2:53:19] <rytisone> use Chainsawmaster style
[2:53:23] <mutantlunchbox1> SHINDERU
[2:53:25] <cipher758> Pat is hiding his power level
[2:53:27] <+bugz_munny> I dont think you can heal with the chainsaw
[2:53:27] <%albret__einstrong> is there new re7 content or is pat just playing it again
[2:53:33] <%linSP> the oldening is real
[2:53:37] <%ssjklyco> Did they reveal if RE VILLAGE will be First Person?
[2:53:39] <+xeros720> does pat not have any healing items?
[2:53:40] <$RealThiele> RE7 is finishing the RE marathon for 3 remake, no face cause AC is broken ATM, game is normal mode
[2:53:42] <+frowntonabbey> you know at this point in the game, you can explore the whole house without him. catch up on items, ammo, etc
[2:53:44] <chhdez> Pat's thoughts are on the babies first, then on dodgeing
[2:53:46] <PiotrRasputin> Pat is commentating. Paige is the one playing guys. Come on.
[2:53:55] <nerdtalkdan> Yeah 8 looking to be FPS
[2:54:01] <nerdtalkdan> Last I heard
[2:54:11] <%albret__einstrong> pat is paige
[2:54:14] <rytisone> it's Elmo playing, I saw a facecam
[2:54:21] <PirateMike_> Pat you gonna do the Chris DLC?
[2:54:23] <%Bt_Robot> OKAY @PeachSaliva YOU CAN GIVE THE CONTROLLER BACK TO PAT NOW
[2:54:25] <+xeros720> irrc, there's a healing item in a bucket in the corner next to the chainsaw
[2:54:27] <$RealThiele> molded ginger has consumed the other
[2:54:29] <KazMkII> I UNDERSTOOD THAT REFERNCE
[2:54:33] <derap41> That's not Groovy >XD
[2:54:34] <%king_wragles> So why does Jack even have chainsaw scissors?
[2:54:48] <$RealThiele> why wouldnt you have chainsaw scissors
[2:54:48] <%Typhaeon> Get his ass
[2:54:53] <wibbwobbler> you don't have to wait, u can grab the chainsaw at the same time as jack
[2:54:54] <nerdtalkdan> Don’t question it
[2:54:54] <+NitronStreams> GO HAM
[2:54:54] <%Bt_Robot> JUST KIDDING, IF SHE HAD THE CONTROLLER, THE FIGHT WOULD ALREADY BE OVER
[2:54:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> YEAH
[2:54:56] <Daxalog> I just got here why is he playing this again?
[2:54:58] <%Mr_Pylon> Bloodborne rules
[2:54:59] <TheHotStuven> LUL
[2:55:00] <derap41> Sometimes normal scissors just arn't enough
[2:55:00] <Talfri> yeah you don't need to back away
[2:55:01] <+BoomerTiro> @RealThiele Because its cool
[2:55:01] <PirateMike_> Why do you not? @king_wragles
[2:55:04] <+dante_must_die_exe> Chainsaw his ass raw, Pat
[2:55:05] <%PettyFunk> @king_wragles My theory was it's a garage crafting project he was working on before the mold
[2:55:07] <rytisone> get in there son
[2:55:08] <Guardiansaiyan> !uptime
[2:55:08] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 55m.
[2:55:10] <%Valdorick> Just face fuck
[2:55:11] <mastermidget23> @king_wragles My guess is Lucas made them.
[2:55:14] <$RealThiele> exactly
[2:55:16] <Dr_Mooose> welp
[2:55:17] <%albret__einstrong> he doesn't have chainsaw scissors, those are just two chainsaws and he is very strong
[2:55:17] <nerdtalkdan> He had a really tough piece of paper
[2:55:34] <$RealThiele> so Chainsaw-chuks
[2:55:35] <Thewoodentree> \ PogChamp /
[2:55:36] <psimon_> is blocking hard in this game or bad?
[2:55:38] <Talfri> there we go
[2:55:39] <derap41> it worked?
[2:55:40] <+Pendragwn> @PettyFunk my theory is that it was kickass so h emade it
[2:55:42] <Scorian> gg
[2:55:42] <KaiserMario> First Try!
[2:55:43] <+buzz7788> nice
[2:55:47] <%ssjklyco> You got jacked up
[2:55:49] <derap41> Face Fucking Worked?
[2:55:49] <%ragingbrachy> great
[2:55:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> LUL
[2:55:49] <+bugz_munny> lol i love that he explodes
[2:55:50] <+ALazo> speedrun strats
[2:55:50] <Talfri> blocking is pretty good in this game imo
[2:55:50] <%Typhaeon> Yeah, shove your chainsaw into his goo hole
[2:55:50] <%twoto858> Yay
[2:55:51] <PiotrRasputin> He won't come back from that surely.
[2:55:52] <wibbwobbler> lol
[2:55:52] <+dante_must_die_exe> Very good
[2:55:53] <%Treuan> pop goes thw weasel
[2:55:55] <misterspotswood> you turned him into baker bits
[2:55:55] <%ScottishMadJacko> Oh i never noticed that growth was a face
[2:55:55] <%PettyFunk> @Pendragwn exactly
[2:56:00] <+NitronStreams> FOTST TRY
[2:56:01] <nerdtalkdan> Everyone saw it! He did it in one try right?
[2:56:02] <Dao_Puppy> Does blocking reduce damage or stop it?
[2:56:02] <$RealThiele> AI bad so be aggressive
[2:56:03] <+NitronStreams> fuck
[2:56:03] <+poweruser> just needed a little brute smarts, just attack 4head
[2:56:04] <+bugz_munny> CHAINSAW NOOOO *booom*
[2:56:06] <whirly25> Need a flashback to lord shimura teaching us how to chainsaw
[2:56:07] <KingVantq> @psimon_ you can duck under high attacks I believe
[2:56:07] <Dr_Mooose> nice job
[2:56:07] <%cowardman93> circle strafe works every time
[2:56:11] <%M3djedx> cosmoUgh
[2:56:12] <%albret__einstrong> he is now DEFINTELY dead and will NEVER BE SEEN AGAIN
[2:56:19] <derap41> That's not how saws work
[2:56:21] <jimbop444> breath deep the dank jack dust
[2:56:23] <skyentombment> That's an OSHA violation
[2:56:23] <ItsJustShawn> seems like a great way to break a chainsaw
[2:56:24] <+Dives__> Not how chainsaws work
[2:56:26] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> well your chainsaw broke LUL
[2:56:26] <Aydarkzero> i'm pretty sure it would recoil
[2:56:26] <%albret__einstrong> it's not possible
[2:56:27] <%ScottishMadJacko> I wish you could have an optional mode to play through with the chainsaw or the axe
[2:56:28] <%cowardman93> residenty evil logic
[2:56:28] <$RealThiele> needed to be a game mode where you keep this badboy
[2:56:29] <%king_wragles> It would, but it would destroy the chainsaw
[2:56:29] <Unicyclemonkey> Trying to play an RE boss like a dark souls boss
[2:56:32] <%albret__einstrong> the chain would go dull instantly
[2:56:33] <+xeros720> maybe if the bar is hollow you could manage
[2:56:33] <rytisone> pick up Jack's chainsaw
[2:56:34] <+Hilleltaco> Well neither is blocking a chainsaw with another chainsaw probably
[2:56:35] <PiotrRasputin> I just hope the framerate in 8 is as good as this on PC. That trailer looked rough..
[2:56:38] <%R3Roundabout> That would not work even a little bit
[2:56:39] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt You say with a stappled on hand
[2:56:39] <+bugz_munny> VIDEO GAMES
[2:56:40] <%Mr_Pylon> don't worry it was just painted wood!
[2:56:40] <Amadeusguy> the fuck was that bar made of, tin???
[2:56:40] <cipher758> damn, his torso exploded. jack is cell
[2:56:41] <dukenux> I can't believe Jack is fucking dead again.
[2:56:43] <+BoomerTiro> It's kinda possible based upon factors not clearly indicated
[2:56:44] <$dalmek> I'd imagine the chains would just rip and shoot bits everywhere
[2:56:49] <%linSP> if you eat jack’s meat will it regenerate inside you making you explode
[2:56:52] <PirateMike_> Youd need a diaond saw
[2:56:55] <+notkojima> what a clever line
[2:56:55] <KaiserMario> Could be an old and rusted metal bar...
[2:56:57] <+NitronStreams> Jack refused

[2:56:59] <rytisone> he wont
[2:57:03] <%Ynkubus_> Shoulda said please Etahan
[2:57:04] <albret__einstrong> @PatStaresAt also impossible: blocking a chainsaw wirth another chainsaw
[2:57:06] <+tylerpyre> but pouring boba tea on your arm to heal your leg injury is possible?
[2:57:09] <+StooEsq> Ethan getting his hopes up
[2:57:11] <wibbwobbler> so cheesy
[2:57:11] <misterspotswood> ethan mars
[2:57:13] <derap41> @linSP Grom?
[2:57:13] <BallerSwagBro9k> @piotrrasputin That was definitely on console tho. PC should be fine
[2:57:13] <Aydarkzero> But the future refused to change
[2:57:14] <ChatNinja> Jack Baker for Smash
[2:57:15] <bookofmouths> There are some chems in the cop room

[2:57:24] <PirateMike_> Pat you gonna play the DLCs?
[2:57:26] <nerdtalkdan> Dude is made of BOW mold but cutting the metal bar is the thing that bothers you?
[2:57:26] <%Typhaeon> If it's bubble tea, where's the tapioca pearls?
[2:57:28] <%PettyFunk> Yeah if you blocked one chainsaw with another would they spin out of your hand? Or just fuck up and kill the engine immediately
[2:57:29] <KaiserMario> Theres a chem fluid under the table at the cop room
[2:57:31] <+bugz_munny> The Bakers are the best
[2:57:32] <BallerSwagBro9k> @chatninja No Joe Baker
[2:57:32] <+BoomerTiro> @tylerpyre Try it
[2:57:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> And Jack was dead forever! No need to make deep-fried meatballs out of him.
[2:57:35] <PiotrRasputin> @BallerSwagBro9k I hope so. Plan to play it on PC day 1.
[2:57:38] <Aydarkzero> Jack welcomes you to the family!
[2:57:39] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @linSP actually, that sounds like särimner, this pig the norse gods had in valhalla that provided infinite bacon
[2:57:42] <dukenux> Joe Baker for Smash(unironically)
[2:57:51] <$RealThiele> i imagine the saws would stall out, or worse case one of them slips their chain

[2:57:54] <Aydarkzero> finally quick turning!
[2:57:56] <Thewoodentree> I just decided that the healing juice is Gweneth Paltro's GOOP
[2:57:59] <+OwlLightningMage> Joe Baker needs more pushing
[2:58:00] <%Bt_Robot> DO THE RE SPIN
[2:58:03] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @linSP as in, they kept carving out of it
[2:58:05] <+tylerpyre> @BoomerTiro All right. Lemme cut my leg off real quick
[2:58:05] <derap41> @nerdtalkdan Superman suspension of disbelief you know the drill

[2:58:33] <nerdtalkdan> @derap41 amen
[2:58:33] <SuperSonichu> I actually really liked how 7 handwaved the healing juice as it activating the regenerating fungus in your body that hasn't hit your brain yet
[2:58:40] <rytisone> you coulda just unlocked the door
[2:58:41] <+BoomerTiro> @tylerpyre Get the tea first!
[2:58:42] <jimbop444> Texas chainsaw massacre 2 had th3 best chainsaw duel ever
[2:58:42] <BallerSwagBro9k> @pettyfunk Both chains would shatter and probably injure the wielders with flax
[2:58:46] <%SirGO0SE> is it called the RE speen?
[2:58:47] <Vitoria90> Alrighty, part 1 of RE7
[2:58:47] <BallerSwagBro9k> PAST BIT
[2:58:49] <+OwlLightningMage> Make Paige play the Joe Baker DLC
[2:58:49] <PiotrRasputin> Show us.
[2:58:51] <+evbites> the resident evil spin
[2:58:52] <$RealThiele> its the locomotion?
[2:58:56] <+Dives__> Speeen

[2:58:59] <%ragingbrachy> do the dance pat
[2:59:00] <+bugz_munny> sup grandma
[2:59:00] <bookofmouths> shoot old lady
[2:59:00] <%CzeekyPlays> I forgot how low FOV RE7 is
[2:59:01] <Thewoodentree> @PatStaresAt Its the turn your neck
[2:59:01] <%DensityD> dance little puppets dance
[2:59:03] <%Bailey__gaming> How is Paiges back BTW?
[2:59:05] <Vitoria90> I tried to get into this game but I couldn't, I didn't like how it doesn't pause in the menus and how the enemies are
[2:59:07] <%Nupinoop296> i love that though
[2:59:16] <%DensityD> psaGief
[2:59:17] <ChoculaUltra> @SuperSonichu As someone who just watched part 41 of that Chris-Chan documentary, your username threw me for a fucking LOOP.
[2:59:19] <nerdtalkdan> I wonder if Ethan gets PTSD every time he gets a little mold in his bathroom now
[2:59:19] <+evbites> damn
[2:59:24] <%PettyFunk> @BallerSwagBro9k That makes sense, the chains would definitely be going too fast to actually hook each other in any way. Probably tons of shrapnel
[2:59:26] <PirateMike_> Finally a dance pat can do
[2:59:26] <CoffinComrade> low fov is scarier tho
[2:59:31] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @linSP umbrella could legit solve world hunger with their technology, building infinitely regenning farm animasl
[2:59:33] <nerdtalkdan> He just has buckets of bleach ready to go
[2:59:36] <SuperSonichu> @ChoculaUltra zap to the extreme baby
[2:59:39] <mr_gunn> Ethan!
[2:59:41] <$some_sunflowers> Just got here and am confused. Is this just a normal replay?
[2:59:42] <+OwlLightningMage> The Owl Twist
[2:59:48] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Man, I hope Joe Barker just somehow winds up in RE8 for no reason and just starts suplexing werewolves
[3:00:06] <%Bailey__gaming> @peachsaliva hope your backs feeling better
[3:00:11] <+OwlLightningMage> Joe Baker for Tekken
[3:00:13] <%Typhaeon> The only cameo I'd care about in 8 is Sheva
[3:00:18] <Talfri> @SaltkeyAndAckfish but it seems eating the infinite regen flesh infects you too, so people would all become regen creatures
[3:00:22] <derap41> Bless you
[3:00:23] <+Hilleltaco> that was a fun one
[3:00:24] <$RealThiele> Joe baker could just have his own game during his time in the Marines, put him in the Arklay mountains on patrol
[3:00:25] <+BoomerTiro> That sneeze sounded fun
[3:00:25] <%DensityD> dumb sneeze
[3:00:26] <PiotrRasputin> If Barry doesn't come back again..
[3:00:26] <nerdtalkdan> Yeah the reveal of Umbrella’s motivations was a bit of a let downs. But I’m the flip side, what else could it have been?
[3:00:27] <%Bailey__gaming> bless u pat
[3:00:27] <%ragingbrachy> 🔫
[3:00:28] <+NitronStreams> bless you

[3:00:40] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @Talfri we'll work out the kinks
[3:00:42] <wibbwobbler> salud
[3:00:51] <+evbites> the scorpion key is in the basement in the morgue
[3:00:54] <+BoomerTiro> There was more joy in that sneeze than during the whole boss fight
[3:00:55] <BallerSwagBro9k> @amanishouseofnonsense I said the same thing on the day of the reveal LUL. Have him like be on vacation or something and it just so happens RE8 happens there LUL
[3:00:57] <+Hilleltaco> That sounded like confetti shot out
[3:00:57] <+frowntonabbey> does he seriously not have that key yet
[3:01:06] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @Talfri besides, if you cook the meat it should be fine, no?
[3:01:22] <rytisone> Grandma has it
[3:01:22] <+evbites> in the meat pile
[3:01:24] <+Dives__> yep

[3:02:17] <turbofolk> SMOOTH BRAIN
[3:02:19] <pochiyeah> smooth brain is a good thing
[3:02:20] <%Nupinoop296> is it the lack of AC?
[3:02:21] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @nerdtalkdan though there are people who eat pork raw and suffer from horrible leptospirosis
[3:02:24] <+gnoame> 36 Years and counting
[3:02:24] <turbofolk> THATS BEEN FOREVER

[3:03:10] <%linSP> the way Paige sneezed is how my friend used to laugh
[3:03:12] <nerdtalkdan> Why does this place have a morgue man?
[3:03:13] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> @nerdtalkdan wiat not leptospirosis, trichinosis

[3:03:47] <SainEdge> the green thing in the corridor Pat LUL
[3:03:51] <%crimsonharvest> it wouldn't be weird for a country house this size to have one basement, but it would be for storing your canned goods and napping in the summer
[3:03:52] <bookofmouths> hell of a basement the baker's have
[3:03:54] <+Dives__> You've gone to far

[3:04:09] <%DensityD> The absolute smoothest
[3:04:12] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> @PettyFunk The whole campaign is Joe just being frustrated that no one speaks "American", he doesn't even register the vampires
[3:04:13] <Aydarkzero> if only Pat had Shotgun FeelsBadMan
[3:04:15] <%R3Roundabout> STILL ARE
[3:04:15] <%BoneofMalkav> Pat: "Chat, you are the worst, I can't believe I trusted you." Also Pat: "Chat, How do dis?" LUL

[3:04:35] <+Dives__> There was a green gate you didn't open
[3:04:37] <$Vineslop_Tod> @PatStaresAt it's in the processing room with the gross meat balls
[3:04:37] <%Maids4lyfe> the cop turned into potato salad

[3:04:59] <+evbites> look for green gate
[3:05:02] <DeltaPangaea> Your mistake was thinking that Pat EVER felt he needed to be in a position of authority to mock people
[3:05:03] <%BoneofMalkav> LUL
[3:05:03] <%Maids4lyfe> this isn't the morgue
[3:05:03] <%PettyFunk> @AmanisHouseOfNonsense He'd just shrug off the witches and vampires as some damned foreign nonsense that he don't care for
[3:05:11] <%Typhaeon> Did you call it green because you knew Pat would
[3:05:15] <nerdtalkdan> Yeah at least in this game and RE2R the moist look makes sense
[3:05:26] <$insaneintentionsyo> insane120Ree
[3:05:30] <KaiserMario> The problem is that Pat is playing from memory, when his memory is fucked
[3:05:36] <+OwlLightningMage> Joe Baker takes his fighting totems to RE8 and they give him magic punch powers
[3:05:36] <%crimsonharvest> the security curtain?
[3:05:36] <+Dives__> Turn left out of bathtub room
[3:05:42] <DeltaPangaea> The cop's probably in that meat pile

[3:36:17] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Horrible house? Maybe my bees can restore your family to sanity!
[3:36:21] <derap41> Do you eat 100% penut butter or that diluted stuff?

[4:03:06] <%Piemono> Been feeding my dogs raw chickens for years
[4:03:06] <Dr_Mooose> jsus
[4:03:07] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> thats fine
[4:03:09] <Dr_Mooose> *jesus
[4:03:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> Sometimes I slow down my beagle by sprinkling her food across 3 or 4 rooms. She seems to enjoy hunting the kibbles.
[4:03:19] <KaiserMario> You missed it during your first LP
[4:03:20] <%king_wragles> @MegboyManuel raw food is okay for most dogs. There's a few pure bred breeds that can't handle it though
[4:03:21] <dinnydanny777> Like those weird spider beasts from Dark Souls 2
[4:03:22] <$SweetCheeksTVR> OH no....
[4:03:23] <%emperordread> Salad fingers or RE7, which is more unnerving?
[4:03:23] <Talfri> Long forearm
[4:03:24] <marvel877> You missed seeing that last time.
[4:03:25] <+ZeddySpaghetti90> hell to the naw
[4:03:26] <@PeachSaliva> @piemono I’m hoping he’ll be interested in that at some point
[4:03:29] <%Aztec50> what goes into making dog food yourself?
[4:03:33] <Davimotion96> She reminds me of the toilet guy from Majora's Mask
[4:03:35] <Talfri> That's special
[4:03:38] <+OwlLightningMage> Just don't leave a giant chocolate bunny around like Pat likes to do
[4:03:38] <@SoFarFetched> Think he saw it during Paige's LP of it.
[4:03:45] <%Dementedpenguin> I remember experiencing this part for the first time, I was like "Fucking what are you making me do game? WutFace "
[4:03:47] <+gnoame> paaaypaaar
[4:03:48] <%MegboyManuel> Thats fair I guess, i just dont trust human procssed raw food
[4:03:50] <+evbites> ethan is sassy
[4:03:52] <marvel877> Salad fingers is always unsettling.
[4:03:52] <+dmtjinni> u seen the vid of dog annihilating its food in less than 1 sec?
[4:03:53] <aeronauticaljon> Each dog is different too, especially diet
[4:03:53] <%MegboyManuel> were filthy creatures
[4:03:54] <chhdez> Hey guys, have you seen that cat diet from the guy with record for cats that end up living almost 30 years
[4:03:58] <DeltaPangaea> "That's special" Ethan continuing his quips
[4:04:13] <%king_wragles> raw salmon is really good for dogs. Healthy skin and fur
