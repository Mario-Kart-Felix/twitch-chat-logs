[0:43:46] <%toastybites> neighborhood drug deeler who is also a priest
[0:43:50] <afromexicano> True
[0:43:52] <marshalmorphino22> Elmo in his Elmo tree
[0:43:53] <%MistyMntns> Egg
[0:43:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Be sure to edit out his head when he reacts to Disco later
[0:43:58] <%Frost_Quill> Sith Lord Pat.
[0:44:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pat the Egg Man will finally get that blasted hedgehog
[0:44:02] <+b_aleph> humpty dumpty looking ass
[0:44:04] <Lunaslostlove> cosplaying the lodge guy from harvester
[0:44:06] <marshalmorphino22> How big is Gief now?
[0:44:06] <%BinaryFireball> you need a zip up hoodie
[0:44:10] <couriersix2000> for a second he looked like Kane
[0:44:13] <%MistyMntns> Egg Man in COUCH CUBE
[0:44:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> You need to get a cool hat to keep your head warm
[0:44:21] <%walternatorz> Pat is just a floating head and panty hose
[0:44:24] <koffeemancer> Fuck, someone put his head on that kid from E.T. LUL
[0:44:26] <camelwizard> hooray!
[0:44:27] <DanThePumpkinman> ok
[0:44:28] <%ThirdWelles> Pat which do you think is more likely for DBD: Nemesis or G1 Birkin?
[0:44:41] <+TheotherKristian> Why filipino?
[0:44:42] <%DeathByTincan> PLease put on pyjama fishnets
[0:44:43] <Pookiedaexzile> Those are Intestines
[0:44:46] <%Alazull> Nemesis
[0:44:47] <%thbluewarden> im pretending
[0:44:47] <%Kataguro> I want X
[0:44:47] <Pookiedaexzile> not Stockings
[0:44:56] <Lunaslostlove> nut
[0:44:57] <Blank9> jack baker would be good
[0:44:57] <%TigerCatGo> Yep! FLoating head and floating with intenstines put
[0:44:57] <DanThePumpkinman> watch it be og tyrant
[0:44:58] <%baka_sugoi> X
[0:44:59] <+TheotherKristian> X-san
[0:45:01] <%weissguard> Both are pretty solid choices
[0:45:01] <Zebylth> goop monster
[0:45:04] <%ThirdWelles> Because nemesis with the tentacles is kind of already in death slinger
[0:45:04] <%Kataguro> Big Think
[0:45:05] <Blank9> he'd definitely put you on a hook
[0:45:06] <%Broand> pat has gone to sleep
[0:45:06] <+ratreborn> its gona be either Mr.X or Birkin
[0:45:07] <marshalmorphino22> Tyrant
[0:45:07] <%Meidolaon> Clearly Lady D for Dead By Daylight
[0:45:08] <%za7az> Pat died
[0:45:10] <%saadi90> Lady D
[0:45:11] <%Aeoneth> Pat forgot the question and is just vibing at this point
[0:45:12] <joshua_42> Nah bro it’s gonna be Jack Baker
[0:45:13] <%walternatorz> whatever is easier to model
[0:45:14] <barefootbark> oooo
[0:45:15] <+TheotherKristian> No, fuck it, first villain is WESKER
[0:45:16] <%Frost_Quill> Tyrant might be cool.
[0:45:16] <%thelaxinator> mister X
[0:45:16] <couriersix2000> man theres so many cool choices
[0:45:16] <cardamomo88> big hunke
[0:45:16] <$PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Are you still having an issue with the PS5 heating up the plastic
[0:45:18] <%toastybites> did he stroke out
[0:45:19] <linSP> x gonna give it
[0:45:21] <barefootbark> pat has ceased
[0:45:21] <%IveGotALaserFace> What would be his power?
[0:45:22] <+ratreborn> or Tyrant
[0:45:22] <%caramelatte1> Birkin
[0:45:28] <%Kataguro> RE1 Tyrant would be so fucking boring
[0:45:30] <marshalmorphino22> I can see the gears turning
[0:45:30] <$Afterman_> Give me a hunter gamma as killer please
[0:45:32] <%Mucmaster> The monster is gonna be Ashley in  a suit of armour
[0:45:37] <%ThirdWelles> Just straight tyrant would be a good one
[0:45:43] <NitronStreams> Berkin, Mr. X, Nemesis, Jack Baker, and Lady D are all good picks
[0:45:47] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt Mr X with or without the Hat?
[0:45:52] <%Dementedpenguin> Ashely survivor gogogo Kappa
[0:45:56] <cardamomo88> MR X FOR THE MEME
[0:45:57] <%SirGO0SE> what if its just lady d's ass
[0:45:57] <Pookiedaexzile> WereWolf Berkin
[0:46:03] <%ThirdWelles> What about Pipe Birkin?
[0:46:04] <hawkhollywood> hit ya with a surprise and give you Dino-man from RE6
[0:46:04] <%AgniBrandt> Watch it be Wesker
[0:46:05] <%thelaxinator> G2 birkin is a little too thicc for those doorways isn't he?
[0:46:05] <%Kataguro> Nemesis would be overtuned if they do him right
[0:46:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Ya'll forgot
[0:46:09] <%IveGotALaserFace> ROCKET LAUNCHER!
[0:46:10] <%caramelatte1> Wat if wesker though, cause we have a humon plastic doll as a killer too
[0:46:12] <$Afterman_> nemesis has a implant parasite button i hope
[0:46:14] <%livlinn> arf
[0:46:15] <%JoshManVGH> But Mr X could just punch people
[0:46:15] <+willofonez> give Me yoshinori Ono chasing me
[0:46:17] <oniwahoo> I really don't think Lady D will get in, I don't think she fits the style
[0:46:19] <%ramielthe5th> mr. ex with the little hat :3
[0:46:19] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> PUP GO BORK
[0:46:21] <DanThePumpkinman> it'd be hype if it was jack baker
[0:46:22] <%Kataguro> Who for survivor?  Leon?
[0:46:26] <%AkronymCLT> what if it was Salazar
[0:46:29] <Dragovus> ELMO!
[0:46:30] <nivlac_555> just enlarge the map like reverse
[0:46:30] <%walternatorz> psaGib psaGib psaGib psaGib
[0:46:31] <%MistyMntns> Give me some Lady D
[0:46:35] <DanThePumpkinman> rebecca
[0:46:36] <%Frost_Quill> Wesker would be dope, we don't have enough killers in DBD that just look like dudes.
[0:46:36] <%ThirdWelles> I could see pipe birkin. Since he's more recently present in the RE world
[0:46:38] <DanThePumpkinman> duh
[0:46:39] <%Ranryu692> Rebecca
[0:46:39] <Davimotion96> Ashley
[0:46:40] <Dragovus> BRAD VICKERS!
[0:46:40] <+TheotherKristian> Leon is too hot
[0:46:43] <donkzrahite> The guy aid "Kill or be killed."
[0:46:44] <%Daxalog> Leon isnt dead
[0:46:46] <Blank9> moira as a survivor would be good
[0:46:46] <Sotetsu> Hi, Elmo!
[0:46:47] <+king_of_beggars> Rebecca but she's huge and muscular.
[0:46:48] <%AkronymCLT> Ashley
[0:46:49] <%MistyMntns> psaElmo psaBlep psaWink
[0:46:49] <thelonechris> The boi
[0:46:50] <%SirGO0SE> pls becky and billy
[0:46:50] <%Kataguro> Rebecca or Ashley would both be great
[0:46:50] <%Meidolaon> Ethan
[0:46:51] <$apolitenoob> Obviously the correct choice is Salazar
[0:46:51] <Dragovus> BRAD
[0:46:53] <Zero_Jacks> Billy?
[0:46:53] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Ashley?
[0:46:54] <%caramelatte1> Outbreak group
[0:46:54] <%ThirdWelles> Leon and Jill or Claire
[0:46:55] <$Afterman_> they will do what they did for silent hill survivor, have skins that turn them into other characters
[0:46:56] <jorniev> ASHLEY GRAHAM
[0:46:56] <%Alazull> It should be Thomas the Tank Engine with X Gonna Give It To Ya playing as it gets closer
[0:46:58] <+kewlmyc> That won't stop them
[0:46:59] <soundcloud_raptor> da baby
[0:47:00] <$Afterman_> Brad
[0:47:00] <%Mucmaster> Ashley and Barry's daughter
[0:47:00] <Blank9> moira or ashley
[0:47:00] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> it'll be ashley
[0:47:00] <+trizetacannon44> Ashley
[0:47:01] <%Meidolaon> Ethan and Lady D
[0:47:02] <TerrificAsheriffic> I'd say Ashley possibly
[0:47:02] <%walternatorz> Ashley
[0:47:02] <$Afterman_> Definitely brad
[0:47:03] <+ragingocto1> Ashley
[0:47:04] <%SirGO0SE> ashley would be smart
[0:47:04] <+LastnameSilverLastname> I mean, so was Bill
[0:47:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> Leon would suplex everything
[0:47:06] <%ThirdWelles> Oh shit true
[0:47:06] <thelonechris> Pet him
[0:47:07] <donkzrahite> "Kill or be killed" wa emphasiezed. im betting new mechanics
[0:47:07] <nivlac_555> young sherry
[0:47:07] <kingcrispy9> how about a hunk?
[0:47:08] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Rebecca probably too
[0:47:08] <+evbites> Bring back joe
[0:47:08] <%ThirdWelles> Sherry
[0:47:09] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt Ethan is kinda of a loser so he might work
[0:47:09] <%thelaxinator> can't be eathan
[0:47:09] <%superc37> bill n heather
[0:47:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> They'll probably just scale them to be in line with the rest of the killers right? I don't play DBD so idk how much size variation there is
[0:47:10] <Dragovus> Brad?
[0:47:10] <%AkronymCLT> Mia
[0:47:10] <jorniev> MOIRA
[0:47:11] <%Garthunox> Ashley
[0:47:14] <NitronStreams> We need the RE Losers?
[0:47:14] <Sotetsu> What a pretty kitty
[0:47:15] <%RigmaroleHM> psaWink
[0:47:15] <+evbites> Zoe
[0:47:16] <+king_of_beggars> Lady D-sized Rebecca.
[0:47:16] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> That never stopped them from adding ash from evil dead tho
[0:47:16] <+cade_calrayn> the baby
[0:47:16] <%Puhff> elmo i love do you love me???
[0:47:16] <%A_Mighty_Walrus> wait what if it's lady d that's the killer
[0:47:16] <Cynical2DD> @patstaresat it would be Sherry
[0:47:16] <%AkronymCLT> or Zoe
[0:47:17] <%thelaxinator> ethan can't have his face shown
[0:47:17] <$Afterman_> give me brad or any dead stars members from re1
[0:47:18] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> Bill and heather are also capable and they got nerfed
[0:47:18] <+LastnameSilverLastname> Bill and Ash from Evil Dead are also capable of murder time fun time, though
[0:47:18] <TerrificAsheriffic> Elmo is majestic
[0:47:19] <%thbluewarden> someone for revelations?
[0:47:19] <Shwepie> Robert Kendo?
[0:47:22] <%IveGotALaserFace> Ethan
[0:47:22] <%Dementedpenguin> *gets hooked* "LEON! WutFace "
[0:47:23] <%ThirdWelles> Ashley's a good pick.
[0:47:25] <%weissguard> psaWink psaWink psaWink psaWink psaWink psaWink psaWink
[0:47:26] <%Puhff> JAKE
[0:47:26] <%ThirdWelles> What about Sheva??

[0:47:38] <Ghostduck01> did I miss disco?
[0:47:39] <thelonechris> He's nodding
[0:47:39] <%ThirdWelles> Sheva only killed monsters for one game
[0:47:41] <%thelaxinator> If the villain is dimitrescu people will freak out
[0:47:41] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Teen Sherry would be an odd choice.
[0:47:41] <+king_of_beggars> Hero-Heart Vickers!
[0:47:42] <$PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Because if you PS5 is still get hot enough that it causes a crack it could be realeasing some toxins into the air

[0:53:34] <+king_of_beggars> The reason I watch Pat and Paige isn't for the gameplay, it's for the avant garde neo-deconstructionist show that is them trying to start a video game stream and failing because of animals and food.

[1:07:25] <linSP> WOOLIE DIDNT GET TO CUNO
[1:07:29] <theRedBack3> I absolutely adore Disco Elysium. I wish for more games like it same with Myst. Disco Elysium is a game that, however, could never be recaptured in its complete beauty and absolutely stellar writing. I used to think video games are just getting worse until I played Disco Elysium and had my breath taken away.
[1:07:30] <+buttdirt> are the stairs crusty
[1:07:31] <televisedrevolting> @ssjklyco Kino

[1:08:04] <+Jiggisnipe> I think Cuno is great, I would hate interacting with him in real life tho
[1:08:04] <%BappoTheMighty> @PatStaresAt I assume you're feeling better now. Hope the migraine wasn't too bad. D:
[1:08:06] <MonsieurHedge> you should do shittons of magnesium about it

[1:08:56] <%Frost_Quill> I only learned recently that a big chunk of the population just...don't get headaches at all?  And I was pissed.
[1:08:57] <farrellcityking> Might be a good idea to toss the stream away today. Zangeif is
[1:08:58] <+buttdirt> what about money. People will kill for money

[1:09:30] <%ThirdWelles> That bitch is dense
[1:09:32] <%Mendin> Bone dissolving acid is hydrofluoric acid and yeah it just soaks through your skin and goes straight for the calcium
[1:09:34] <OmegaDragonR2> and a lot of it
[1:09:38] <sirtommygunn> whats really fun is getting the tractors down from the top of the stack
[1:09:39] <%thelaxinator> boiling hot lobster oil, a full pan of it every night, had to carry it open-topped for 12 feet every single night, never melted my face off thankfully
[1:09:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> That pallet has no honor!

[1:13:36] <%Solarint> I always get excited when pat goes afk
[1:13:37] <+spongeofmystery> Always blown away by the rigging on Pat's tiny legs compared to Paige's normal ones
[1:13:56] <DisGuyOvahEre> @couriersix2000 reddit was your first mistake

[1:29:24] <+purplestufff> sad hours folks
[1:29:30] <%Blackleafx> Hey there's money in that furnace!
[1:29:31] <naoi0> @ReallyBigRocks Dr. Lt. Love to the rescue
[1:29:32] <+MisterAvry> I'm behind on these streams, did Pat ever get that body down?
[1:29:35] <huskarl_zap> The nose knows we need cocaine
[1:29:39] <Broken_Sonex> @ReallyBigRocks I know, right?
[1:29:44] <%Kataguro> He shot it down.  Aces Low
[1:29:45] <+MisterAvry> Hooray!
[1:29:53] <%Broand> There's an exist at the right side of the hallway
[1:29:56] <%Mucmaster> Right now the body is resting inside a bear
[1:29:57] <%Broand> exit*
[1:29:57] <%Mendin> There's a second balcony the other side
[1:30:00] <%Monkeyweed21> @MisterAvry he shot it down and put it in the bear fridge
[1:30:07] <%GarbageNirvana> He did it cool shooty bang style
[1:30:08] <%Blackleafx> @MisterAvry Afaik he's done most stuff available by day 2, beyond the boule players and the docks
[1:30:09] <+PkSilent01> We also Got a Up high and a Down Low from Kim for geting the body down
[1:30:09] <+MisterAvry> nice
[1:30:17] <aiutare47> By the way pat, all items have cool descriptions, especially clothers, like those jeans.
[1:30:23] <+MisterAvry> fine policework
[1:30:33] <%Tuna_Can_0> music is eerily sad FeelsBadMan
[1:30:35] <+EySoyCoco> what's in his right hand?
[1:30:41] <+illusiveSaint> the gated second floor is much later after some quests
[1:30:41] <+EySoyCoco> ledger?
[1:30:46] <huskarl_zap> Journal
[1:30:47] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm disappointed, I had 5 points in motorics and still couldn't shoot it down
[1:30:48] <naoi0> @EySoyCoco Ledger.
[1:30:49] <%thelaxinator> People just leave money lying around in Martainaise
[1:30:49] <%Blackleafx> If there's anything I wish this game had, its a more detailed explanation of hwat you're exiting into when you leave an area
[1:30:57] <huskarl_zap> case files
[1:30:57] <%Tuna_Can_0> How are you taking notes with your crowbar?
[1:31:01] <pokefan9956> why does harry look somewhat presentable
[1:31:10] <%Blackleafx> @GarbageNirvana How'd ya get it down?
[1:31:10] <naoi0> @Blackleafx Ehh I mean the loading screens aren't too long
[1:31:12] <huskarl_zap> wat
[1:31:21] <%thelaxinator> why was that reaction speed?
[1:31:35] <%Blackleafx> @naoi0 Yeah but this apartment building struck me as one point where its genuinely confusing where you're exiting
[1:31:36] <$Ziegsy> @pokefan9956 because youre not seeing the full outfit
[1:31:41] <+elmontoyoya> KEKW
[1:31:56] <cardamomo88> i m back what do i miss
[1:32:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> Thanks encyclopedia
[1:32:01] <naoi0> Why tomorrow?
[1:32:05] <%GarbageNirvana> @Blackleafx The way that isn't the cool one
[1:32:09] <SomeAsianDood> Has he gotten the body out of the tree yet?
[1:32:12] <naoi0> oh.
[1:32:12] <%Blackleafx> Dude isnt home by nnow
[1:32:19] <naoi0> @SomeAsianDood Yes.
[1:32:20] <%Kataguro> Yeah, he shot it down
[1:32:27] <+evbites> @SomeAsianDood yup
[1:32:32] <skyentombment> Let's go buy a book about COCK...atoos
[1:32:37] <SomeAsianDood> Oh shit he shot it down? How bout the autopsy?
[1:32:41] <%Blackleafx> Pat has gotten the body down and he did the FULL autopsy
[1:32:46] <teflonbilly777> Shooting the body down is hilariously sloppy
[1:32:49] <+illusiveSaint> did pat ask about that lady's missing husband?
[1:32:52] <naoi0> Crushed it
[1:32:55] <%thelaxinator> The Detective can remember the full service history of a 9mm rifle but can't remember what he had for breakfast. I can relate.
[1:33:03] <+SunnyVarietyPack> Pat has huge [PP energy
[1:33:04] <%Blackleafx> @illusiveSaint yes, I think so
[1:33:04] <+MisterAvry> cockatoos are VERY demanding pets
[1:33:08] <linSP> yeah cocks of twos
[1:33:09] <+zinris> pretty gud
[1:33:11] <naoi0> @illusiveSaint yeah
[1:33:14] <MonsieurHedge> pat has discovered the killer, solved the crime, married kim and adopted three children, all of which he has named Cuno
[1:33:17] <yeeyeyee> You know, you can literally open the twitch integration overlay, look at the notebook, and SEE what pat has done
[1:33:22] <yeeyeyee> you don't have to ask
[1:33:26] <%Kataguro> You must learn your Heraldic Bird
[1:33:29] <teflonbilly777> But cockatoos are very cute when they want scitches
[1:33:31] <%ssjklyco> There is a list of task you can see on the stream for updates on what he's done
[1:33:37] <SomeAsianDood> @yeeyeyee I can't on mobile
[1:33:45] <SomeAsianDood> or at least my fingers are too big
[1:33:45] <+MisterAvry> @yeeyeyee I did not know that
[1:33:46] <+b_bang_> a book about a cock or two
[1:33:46] <Blackleafx> Honestly, can I just say I fucking love the pacing of this game? Its a pain in the ass to keep track of, especially if you're streaming, I'd imagine, but its really really good...
[1:33:55] <+evbites> top left
[1:33:55] <+zinris> oh god ur letting that girl freeze outside

[2:23:49] <jorniev> DONT
[2:23:50] <%Arancet> go for it
[2:23:50] <OmegaDragonR2> save scum time
[2:23:52] <grub> NO

[2:23:53] <jorniev> SAVE FIRST
[2:23:53] <PartyFavors> Roll em
[2:23:54] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> save scum
[2:23:54] <+pectusumbra> you could come back
[2:23:54] <+Sveargieth> You got this
[2:23:55] <+upandadam> COULD
[2:23:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> Come back later

[2:23:56] <%genocidal_cupcake> just keave
[2:23:56] <Hellarussian> trust in the 3%
[2:23:57] <+Mrbaconator> LATER
[2:23:58] <%maskedsongbird> Oh no, bad luck....
[2:23:58] <NeroInfinite> Later much later
[2:24:02] <%Piemen99> FUCKING SEND IT
[2:24:03] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> do noy buy
[2:24:04] <cis_eraser_420> change your clothes first at least
[2:24:05] <%thelaxinator> you'd get 8% at most
[2:24:06] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[2:24:07] <qo_op> pray hard
[2:24:08] <%Maids4lyfe> save scum
[2:24:08] <%Piemen99> BOOOOO
[2:24:15] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt i think the chat is ok with save scumming now lol
[2:24:23] <Ravioli_Ronin> MAXI BOOST
[2:24:24] <+fetrigon> @maids4lyfe FeelsWeirdMan
[2:24:25] <OmegaDragonR2> save scum... FOR ART!
[2:24:28] <ingman112> Nah nah don’t save scum
[2:24:35] <%thelaxinator> save scumming a 3% can take like 20 minutes
[2:24:35] <ingman112> Better to go with the flow
[2:24:39] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Trust in the 3%
[2:24:41] <NeroInfinite> At 3%? yeah I wouldn't bother with save scumming
[2:24:43] <%ThirdWelles> save scumming defeats the entire structure of this game
[2:24:43] <fedemachado96> do the check
[2:24:47] <fedemachado96> dew it
[2:24:49] <%Blackleafx> Huh
[2:24:51] <skyentombment> I've ALWAYS been ok with savescumming, one should save scum as much as physically feasible
[2:24:58] <+marlborored5> but IT'S FOR ART, FOR THE BEATIFYING
[2:24:59] <trickster721> I thought this game had deterministic rolls?
[2:25:00] <%Blackleafx> I got the option to take her stuff
[2:25:00] <%ThirdWelles> Like it is BUILT around failure and the continuation of the story after failure
[2:25:01] <%Monkeyweed21> If you fail that red check you shit your pants in real life
[2:25:05] <%Kataguro> Try it and see
[2:25:07] <OmegaDragonR2> SURE...sure... but art tho?
[2:25:09] <%ThirdWelles> Save scumming straight up ruins it
[2:25:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Combos Defeat the entire structure of a flighting game
[2:25:12] <%dork_doggler> Bro red checks are almost always worth failing
[2:25:13] <%Blackleafx> Sorry, must've been dfferent for me
[2:25:14] <jorniev> MIGHT find something later
[2:25:18] <tanarath> Do the 3%
[2:25:20] <gobbetkuzu> come back later
[2:25:21] <aiutare47> Pat can you pause the stream I gotta piss
[2:25:26] <qo_op> roll the bones
[2:25:27] <%thelaxinator> there are a limited amount of checks where Boxcars still don't succeed
[2:25:30] <cardamomo88> SAD
[2:25:33] <jorniev> 2
[2:25:35] <+athuramn> Electrochemistry: Come on. Don't listen to these chodes. 3% is just another way of saying 100% thrill.

[2:27:27] <%Monkeyweed21> thats normal
[2:27:28] <+illusiveSaint> kim has given you so much already
[2:27:31] <trickster721> If you try to siphon gas from his car I assume he just shoots you.

[2:35:10] <$NoHopeForMyCuirass> What if Earth had its own dark matter LUL
[2:35:10] <%GarbageNirvana> Is Kim scared of the pale
[2:35:15] <no123450n> the ocean?
[2:35:27] <+evbites> HOLY SHIT ARE WE ACTUALLY ADRIFT IN NOTHINGNESS
[2:35:30] <%Mendin> @GarbageNirvana You're severely brain-damaged and this is a rather high-level concept
[2:35:32] <+athuramn> so... dark souls
[2:35:37] <Dr_Mooose> oh shit
[2:35:39] <%maskedsongbird> So the Pale is just....the sea?
[2:35:44] <+athuramn> a world surrounded by a great fog
[2:35:46] <%Mendin> Less nothingness and more The Warp
[2:35:49] <+illusiveSaint> @GarbageNirvana everyone should be in this game
[2:35:50] <Zap_Rowsdower32> The Pale is void
[2:35:51] <%dork_doggler> @maskedsongbird it's nothingness
[2:35:59] <%mads_valentine> A SEA OF NON REALITY
[2:36:01] <%Kataguro> It's the Void
[2:36:02] <sirrice77> @maskedsongbird no its an void fog
[2:36:03] <%Treuan> What
[2:36:04] <+MetalGearBobo> I mean if you wanna call space nothingness its basically the same shit
[2:36:04] <jorniev> ITS "UN-EXISTANCE"
[2:36:06] <Ravioli_Ronin> So actual RTS fog
[2:36:08] <DSD24> Become nothing
[2:36:10] <+evbites> ANTIMAATTER
[2:36:12] <$NoHopeForMyCuirass> @maskedsongbird No because Insulinde is basically all water but it's an isola
[2:36:12] <T_Sasquatch> how the fuck isnt this commonknowledge
[2:36:12] <OmegaDragonR2> like radiation
[2:36:13] <+zinris> it is antimatter
[2:36:15] <%thelaxinator> Dark matter, but white
[2:36:19] <%mads_valentine> ISLANDS IN THE VOID FUCKING BALLER
[2:36:22] <+illusiveSaint> its why the old lady Paledriver is so weird
[2:36:23] <sirrice77> @MetalGearBobo no see space doesnt mess with your mind
[2:36:25] <Zap_Rowsdower32> It is common knowledge
[2:36:25] <%Kataguro> If you walk too far in one direction, oblivion
[2:36:28] <+MetalGearBobo> return to_____
[2:36:28] <Talen99> THE COLOURLESS FOG
[2:36:30] <Zap_Rowsdower32> The MC just forgot
[2:36:31] <+upandadam> freaky
[2:36:41] <%Treuan> I'm sorry, what
[2:36:41] <codizle> Haha holy shit I can't believe I'm tuning back in after a few days, and Pat is still talking to dis bish
[2:36:44] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> it's the everything of nothing
[2:36:44] <jorniev> THIS game is so fucking well written its kinda nuts
[2:36:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> Isolas are fucking huge god damn
[2:36:48] <%hax_metatron> The Pale is nothing but a diagetic explanation of all the places you CAN’T go to in an RPG while you’re walking around.
[2:36:50] <user_naim> That’s so cool. 6k to the void
[2:36:52] <%Kataguro> Existential Horror
[2:36:56] <iteruq> void just 6000 km away LUL
[2:37:03] <%dork_doggler> @hax_metatron no it fucking isn'
[2:37:04] <$realm_forge> Had this been a sci-fi game this whole time?
[2:37:05] <linSP> what if shes just fucking with your amnesiac brain
[2:37:09] <T_Sasquatch> @Zap_Rowsdower32 yea but she's saying it like it like its not LUL
[2:37:19] <+SunnyVarietyPack> That 's super weird
[2:37:20] <+evbites> i feel like PAIGE would freak the fuck out hearing this
[2:37:22] <%Daxalog> The world is being evaporated and people are STILL BEING RACIST. FUCK.
[2:37:23] <%Treuan> I'm sorry, WHAT
[2:37:25] <%caramelatte1> Is this game getting all fucking meta on your ass?
[2:37:26] <thehullowed> No wonder Kim didn't want you to talk about this.
[2:37:26] <+illusiveSaint> it's literally video game invisible wall and if you go thru you literally lose hp
[2:37:28] <godzookylives> this is indeed a disturbing universe
[2:37:29] <cardamomo88> HERE WE GO
[2:37:32] <%luftraumm1> the best worlbuilding exercise in all media
[2:37:38] <Pookiedaexzile> THis is so much more horrifying to hear about
[2:37:38] <%maskedsongbird> The setting of this game is WAY more high concept and metaphysical than I ever realized...holy shit.
[2:37:41] <%Mendin> It's the edge of the Battle Royale
[2:37:47] <%Kataguro> You'd have to teach kids this real slow in school or they would just lose their collective shit
[2:37:51] <+MetalGearBobo> @sirrice77 i mean it could lol Kappa
[2:37:53] <NeroInfinite> This is some meta shit
[2:37:55] <%Daxalog> Minecraft bedrock
[2:37:55] <%hax_metatron> It literally is what’s at the edge of Pat’s screen in the game LUL
[2:37:57] <televisedrevolting> Numbers stop working
[2:37:58] <jorniev> 70% of the world is covered in it
[2:37:59] <grub> it's a world swallowed by the lovecraftian unknown as blind spots in reality
[2:38:03] <NeroInfinite> It's liek literally limbo
[2:38:04] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Joyce does know more about the Pale than common knowledge, but the state of the world is pretty known.
[2:38:05] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> NUMBERS STOP WORKING
[2:38:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> what does that even mean
[2:38:08] <magboost> A Number Barrier?
[2:38:11] <%dalmek> the number barrier is a cool concept
[2:38:11] <+marlborored5> THE NUMER BARRIER?
[2:38:13] <UnfilteredComic> ???
[2:38:16] <%Ynkubus_> Eh, its fine. Ever present death on the horizon only holds so much terror
[2:38:18] <%Treuan> How are we in an XK class scenario here
[2:38:21] <Ravioli_Ronin> Lmao I missed this convo but got to the church, so this added in there makes everything even more fucked
[2:38:21] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt this seems like to big deal for people to not talk about all the time
[2:38:21] <+fetrigon> @hax_metatron true LUL
[2:38:22] <%GarbageNirvana> Suddenly logistics seems like a pretty big dick job now
[2:38:22] <JoshyJay> THE NUMBERS MASON
[2:38:25] <sirtommygunn> farther you go the less physics apply
[2:38:25] <%muetank> Is it like the abyss in dark souls?
[2:38:27] <+evbites> Birds aren't real?
[2:38:31] <+illusiveSaint> by losing hp lol
[2:38:31] <%Mendin> If numbers stop, math stops, if math stops, physics and reality stop
[2:38:35] <%Arancet> "every man is an island" huh?
[2:38:38] <$realm_forge> Has this been a sci-fi game this whole time?
[2:38:40] <jorniev> OOOH
[2:38:45] <jorniev> YUP
[2:38:47] <thelonechris> It's a fucking cosmic horror
[2:38:48] <UnfilteredComic> Mind damage hmmmm
[2:38:49] <+zinris> PAT's mind is getting damaged right now!!!!
[2:38:50] <Brutusness> this game went sci fi so fast
[2:38:50] <%Ranryu692> fuck *everything else* in this game. This is the only thing I care about now
[2:38:50] <%Agami23> ohhhh
[2:38:51] <jorniev> YES PAT
[2:38:51] <twohitgood> good time for pat to be high
[2:38:51] <%Kataguro> This setting is so cool
[2:38:53] <OmegaDragonR2> mind damage?
[2:38:53] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> MIND DAMAGE YOU SAY
[2:38:54] <aiutare47> NOW YOU REALIZE WHY THIS GAME IS SICK
[2:38:55] <iteruq> its lovercraft
[2:38:55] <grub> it's also the end of history.....
[2:38:55] <NeroInfinite> elborate on that c'thulu shit
[2:38:56] <+athuramn> lol quantum mechanics is gonna be fun for anyone who likes this kinda stuff
[2:38:56] <Dr_Mooose> this sounds terrifying and cool
[2:38:56] <%echobee_tv> WOW
[2:38:57] <sirrice77> @realm_forge kinda sorta yeah
[2:38:57] <+marlborored5> So the pale is an eldrich abomination?
[2:38:58] <%Daxalog> Hes having the momment
[2:38:58] <VyperVic> IMPLICATIONS
[2:38:59] <+Jeshk0> is the pale our actual IRL reality?
[2:38:59] <AvroEltz> WAAAAAI A MINUTE
[2:39:00] <huskarl_zap> magic
[2:39:01] <user_naim> scary shit
[2:39:03] <JoshyJay> god i cant wait for them to expand this universe
[2:39:05] <T_Sasquatch> sure ?
[2:39:07] <%Piemen99> DID DID WE GO INTO THE PALE AND LIVE?
[2:39:07] <jcflyguy> oh no pat big think
[2:39:08] <+Delenay> i just got here and i feel like i need to turn it off right now
[2:39:08] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> HE IS STARTING TO BELIEVE
[2:39:08] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> the old lady
[2:39:09] <Talen99> crawling chaos
[2:39:09] <%Mendin> Earlier, someone asked why this world didn't have rocket ships, NOW YOU KNOW
[2:39:10] <%hax_metatron> It’s the darkness at the edge of Pat’s screen. The “forbidden” places in the game as you go through. A cool in-world explanation of this RPG trope.
[2:39:11] <+CammerTime21> we need gellar fields ASAP
[2:39:13] <+pectusumbra> So your character fucked with the pale?
[2:39:14] <sirtommygunn> finger wag
[2:39:14] <+illusiveSaint> TTALK TO PALEDRIVER AGIAN
[2:39:15] <+upandadam> ooooooooooooooooooh shit
[2:39:15] <ShineTheDiamond> I am so confused.
[2:39:15] <huskarl_zap> we need to snort some pale
[2:39:17] <+MetalGearBobo> so bros whens the mind demon gonna climb up are ass?
[2:39:18] <UnfilteredComic> AndreTheGiant.gif
[2:39:19] <%GarbageNirvana> wwwwwelp
[2:39:21] <+theCatastrophy> I love this game and the Pale is the most interesting thing about it
[2:39:22] <%Kataguro> Now you understand the Paledriver
[2:39:23] <ChungusQuest> So we live in a world half-drowned in Cthulhu spooge?
[2:39:24] <$Afterman_> doge coin up to 20 cents now lol
[2:39:24] <Ravioli_Ronin> YEAH NOW I KNOW
[2:39:33] <Blank9> the pale is the pale you don't need to relate it to some meta thing
[2:39:37] <%Gloom_Tangerine> So you need a kwisaatz haderrach
[2:39:50] <+theCatastrophy> The Pale isn't the edge of the screen or a metaphor of the places you can't go in the game
[2:39:57] <jorniev> "TOTAL DARKNESS"
[2:40:09] <aiutare47> trained
[2:40:13] <Dr_Mooose> what a badass
[2:40:20] <+MetalGearBobo> I actually like the idea of it being the edge of your screen
[2:40:21] <%hax_metatron> The developers literally confirmed that The Pale is their definition for everything they didn’t include in the game. So they need characters to make sense of that in-world
[2:40:24] <magboost> Thats FUCKING 4 TIMES
[2:40:35] <+illusiveSaint> like going thru chernobyl
[2:40:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh noooo
[2:40:48] <T_Sasquatch> The Paledriver NotLikeThis mind blown
[2:40:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Not the Automation
[2:40:49] <+theCatastrophy> @hax_metatron got a link to it. I'd like to see it
[2:40:53] <+evbites> holy shit
[2:40:54] <ShineTheDiamond> I feel like we're getting close to spoilers
[2:40:55] <aiutare47> the science of entropy
[2:40:56] <+MetalGearBobo> @hax_metatron good to know
[2:40:59] <gryffinp> @hax_metatron That doesn't seem like it fits with the notion that the pale is expanding
[2:41:09] <%ThirdWelles> The entropy wall, huh?
[2:41:10] <fly2555_of_the_rebellion> 6k vineThink
[2:41:14] <$realm_forge> So.....there’s a literal end of the world?!
[2:41:16] <%Piemono> The Pale is weird as fuck
[2:41:25] <%Blackleafx> @hax_metatron What? The idea of the Pale predates the videogame by a decade
[2:41:26] <%Ranryu692> it's like that awful episode of DS9 with the old Bajoran ship\
[2:41:26] <%Kataguro> "Fuck all"
[2:41:29] <%GarbageNirvana> So this stuff is what got me super fuckin into this game, I love a good bit of worldbuilding
[2:41:31] <%hax_metatron> @gryffinp As you see more of this world map ... The black portion on the edges expands even mot
[2:41:33] <+evbites> so space but harder
[2:41:37] <%maskedsongbird> We're getting into some Event Horizon/Warhammer 40k shit here
[2:41:38] <jorniev> THE PALE IS MY FAVORITE  FICTION CONCEPT THANKS TO THIS GAME
[2:41:41] <aiutare47> @realm_forge yes
[2:41:42] <%Blackleafx> the pale is based on the novel tha disco elysium is based on
[2:41:43] <%Piemono> @realm_forge It's all the stuff between the countries
[2:41:45] <$NoHopeForMyCuirass> Imagine if travelling from Australia to the US required taking like 30g of shrooms
[2:41:52] <+zinris> the concept of motion lol
[2:41:52] <+fetrigon> @gryffinp they're coming up with new game ideas. Thus more pale.
[2:41:53] <%Kataguro> This is a LOT of shit, Pat
[2:41:53] <ChungusQuest> NO PHYSICS
[2:41:54] <+theCatastrophy> Also, Disco Elysium is set in the world of the writer who worked on the game. He wrote a book that is set in the same world back in 2013
[2:41:55] <linSP> brain hurt
[2:41:56] <%cache_22> psaLiz Why so pale?
[2:41:57] <user_naim> yeah that one got me
[2:41:58] <+JustToWatch> YEAH
[2:41:58] <+JonathLP> Mind goblins are real.
[2:42:00] <aiutare47> ITS SO FUCKING COOL
[2:42:01] <%thelaxinator> Basically they shoot them across the pale and hope they come out the other end
[2:42:02] <OmegaDragonR2> you ok pat?
[2:42:02] <VyperVic> IT'S kicking in
[2:42:03] <%maskedsongbird> @Blackleafx Huh, I didn't know ED was based on a novel.
[2:42:03] <%Solarint> I was NOT expecting this
[2:42:03] <%holydeviant1> Good luck flying through Nonsense Land
[2:42:04] <+Kataguro> There's nothing there to propel you with
[2:42:07] <+marlborored5> THANKS I HATE IT
[2:42:08] <%Piemono> Essentially there are areas of existence between the Pale
[2:42:11] <%Blackleafx> psaGoblin
[2:42:11] <UnfilteredComic> Its like atmospheres in space
[2:42:12] <%Treuan> This is a fucking trip jesus christ
[2:42:12] <huskarl_zap> Event horizon is in the 40k universe don't tell me other wise
[2:42:14] <+illusiveSaint> @gryffinp id say it's expanding when more people imagine more what the in-game world would look like
[2:42:14] <linSP> like a FOOTBALL
[2:42:14] <%Kataguro> GET LOST IN THE VOID
[2:42:15] <sirtommygunn> some difficult concepts to grasp
[2:42:16] <Dr_Mooose> oh
[2:42:17] <%Tuna_Can_0> I don't buy the meta explanation. Why have pages of dialogue for a meta explanation
[2:42:19] <faegbeard> warp travel pog
[2:42:20] <AXL808> GUH
[2:42:21] <%ThirdWelles> imagine all entropy occurring simultaneously
[2:42:25] <$Futurecity10> Pure pale is literally nothingless
[2:42:27] <%Lion_kun> the pale is not just entropy, it's a metaphor
[2:42:27] <+evbites> fuck
[2:42:28] <OmegaDragonR2> vore via cloud
[2:42:28] <cardamomo88> lady that's scary
[2:42:29] <$realm_forge> Holy hell this game....
[2:42:30] <magboost> OH God
[2:42:30] <sirtommygunn> yikes
[2:42:31] <+evbites> FUCK
[2:42:38] <%Blackleafx> @Blackleafx Look up The Sacred and Terrible Air
[2:42:38] <President_McKinley> Kinda like the warp in wh40k
[2:42:39] <$Afterman_> uhh
[2:42:40] <+fetrigon> @illusivesaint exactly
[2:42:41] <+LionKagura> FUCK
[2:42:41] <DianaTheAscian> I wonder how Pats brain is doing hearing this after having medicine
[2:42:42] <$Afterman_> is ths basically
[2:42:43] <AXL808> what is physics, says the pale
[2:42:43] <linSP> return to pale
[2:42:45] <+ThomasOfTroy> APOCALYPSE COP IS REAL
[2:42:45] <$Afterman_> langoliers the game
[2:42:47] <NeroInfinite> This is hard to grasp concepts man
[2:42:48] <aiutare47> and one day there will be no more'='
[2:42:50] <OmegaDragonR2> entropy is death
[2:42:50] <jorniev> APOCALYPSE COOOOOOP
[2:42:51] <%holydeviant1> [heavyy breathing]
[2:42:51] <+evbites> OHHHHHHH
[2:42:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> If it's measurable then how is it unknown?
[2:42:52] <%Ranryu692> if it's unknown, in what way is it measurable?
[2:42:52] <ChungusQuest> There is Nothing, and it is coming for us.
[2:42:55] <%bread_assassin> +
[2:42:57] <+upandadam> lol these dialogue responses
[2:42:58] <$Futurecity10> Literally Entropy
[2:43:00] <+upandadam> grim
[2:43:00] <huskarl_zap> APOC COP IS ONLY WAY
[2:43:00] <$Afterman_> so basically yes, langoliers..
[2:43:02] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> This world has a hard timer
[2:43:02] <magboost> Thats not extream at all
[2:43:04] <Zap_Rowsdower32> THE END IS NIGH
[2:43:04] <+evbites> 1
[2:43:05] <cardamomo88> WE HAVE TO TELL TO POPLE
[2:43:06] <%holydeviant1> THE WOLF IS AT THE DOOR, KIM
[2:43:07] <godzookylives> 3
[2:43:09] <%armandog143> armandog143 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[2:43:10] <+theCatastrophy> The Pale is a fascinating concept and I love it
[2:43:11] <CrimsonFox777> You can't stave off the Nothingness
[2:43:14] <%ThirdWelles> Entropy, baby
[2:43:20] <linSP> dont let the pale set it
[2:43:21] <AhmCha> it's amazing that you can just breeze by this and never learn about this aspect of the game's world
[2:43:22] <+zinris> just font think about it lol
[2:43:22] <linSP> in*
[2:43:24] <$Afterman_> jesus
[2:43:26] <%Treuan> I was not expecting this
[2:43:27] <$Afterman_> thats.. creepy
[2:43:27] <camelwizard> Literally don't let it set in
[2:43:28] <+evbites> THE BLOODENING SHALL COMENCE
[2:43:28] <+Mrbaconator> DON'T LET IT SET IN
[2:43:31] <gryffinp> Something something liberation of night
[2:43:32] <%hax_metatron> It’s going to happen because you’re barreling toward the end of the game. Again, a diagetic explanation of gameplay
[2:43:32] <%Mendin> You could make a religion out of this

[2:58:29] <+MisterAvry> this seems like a filterless cigarette type of person
[2:58:29] <%Deft_Thought> high*
[2:58:33] <%Mendin> @Deft_Thought Your brain is not fucked from the pale, you have the opposite issue
[2:58:36] <OmegaDragonR2> she witnessed the past
[2:58:49] <Admiral_PopnFresh> what is with this lady? she can travel between the living and dead?
[2:58:53] <%Deft_Thought> @Deft_Thought Fascinating
[2:59:00] <ingman112> @deft_thought there also isn’t any pale nearby for the detective to have interacted with; like Joyce said, it’s a ways away
[2:59:04] <$NoHopeForMyCuirass> Haha "heroic dose," nice
[2:59:06] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> @Deft_Thought Nah, his brain is fucked up from all the drinking
[2:59:07] <%hax_metatron> This is why thinking about The Pale as a diagetic explanation of the “blanks” in the world makes sense
[2:59:11] <%Deft_Thought> Huh
[2:59:13] <%Mendin> @Admiral_PopnFresh The Pale gives you memories of the past and it can mess with your perception
[2:59:14] <%hax_metatron> Kim tells you not to think too much of it
[2:59:16] <aiutare47> @Admiral_PopnFresh she has spent way too much time in the Pale
[2:59:23] <%rumtumtugnutz> All cigarettes are filter less if you rip off the filters.
[2:59:24] <cardamomo88> 1
[2:59:32] <ThirdPersonPhil> Return to Vapor!
[2:59:35] <OmegaDragonR2> seems very nihalistic
[2:59:43] <%Mendin> ... She's the Holy Driver, down too long in the midnight see
[2:59:49] <SilverFeng> i love the mysticism of this game
[2:59:50] <+illusiveSaint> pale is a wormhole that lets you witness the past while moving forward
[2:59:50] <%Monkeyweed21> @Admiral_PopnFresh the Pale is everything that ever was and also nothing
[2:59:50] <%Kataguro> Orange
[2:59:54] <+evbites> got it the blackness outside the universe
[2:59:57] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> become as vapour
[3:00:22] <%Kataguro> Don't look into oblivion, kids
[3:00:27] <+MetalGearBobo> @mendin time to "ride the tiger" i guess
[3:00:33] <Admiral_PopnFresh> whoa, the reason for this Pale is more interesting than society on these islands
[3:00:40] <trickster721> Kim doesn't believe in magic, so he's probably annoyed to be living in a world that's like 70% blatant magic
[3:00:47] <%bevyrage> 3
[3:00:50] <jorniev> 3
[3:00:53] <%Kataguro> 3
[3:00:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> have have have have have
[3:00:58] <NeroInfinite> 1 and 2 are the same
[3:01:02] <%facto905> "Yes"
[3:01:07] <%ThirdWelles> Accept nihilism. Become air
[3:01:14] <$NoHopeForMyCuirass> @trickster721 Bruh our world is 75% dark matter, and that shit is as good as magic rn
[3:01:22] <ChungusQuest> A Pale Hole
[3:01:28] <televisedrevolting> Fuck nihilism. Fight the air.
[3:01:30] <Bootkiller6> Man the Pale is one of the weirdest parts of this world's lore
[3:01:32] <ChungusQuest> the non-event horizon
[3:01:44] <jorniev> the end?
[3:01:47] <OmegaDragonR2> like a suped up reverse alzhimers
[3:01:53] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I'm getting Human Instrumentallity vibes
[3:02:09] <cis_eraser_420> the pale rocks. best concept. i love how instantly more fucked up and weird the world becomes when joyce tells you about it
[3:02:14] <ghoulspan> Pat Joel is playing Kenshi right now and hes having a blast
[3:02:19] <ItsPastas> reminds me of kentucky road zero
[3:02:20] <aiutare47> @Admiral_PopnFresh kinda yeah
[3:02:34] <%Kataguro> Want to contemplate the end of all things, Pat?  Want to let it set in?
[3:02:37] <+fetrigon> so fucking meta LUL
[3:02:49] <tanarath> So Pat, how's this game?
[3:02:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Eldritch Vibes

[3:03:12] <huskarl_zap> god damn
[3:03:12] <%Piemono> a great Thought
[3:03:13] <%Mr_Pylon> Good tradeoff
[3:03:15] <NeroInfinite> -1 encyclopedia
[3:03:16] <$Dakuu75> "I CAN HEAR WITH MY SKIN":
[3:03:16] <%ThirdWelles> That's a biiiiiig buff
[3:03:17] <UnfilteredComic> YOOOO
[3:03:17] <+MetalGearBobo> yay! sound demons!
[3:03:22] <OmegaDragonR2> jackpot
[3:03:22] <NeroInfinite> no room for anything else
[3:03:23] <PartyFavors> it's a REAL good thought
[3:03:24] <magboost> Awesome
[3:03:25] <%Kataguro> This is an incredibly powerful thought
[3:03:31] <+illusiveSaint> -1 Encylopedia we don't need you anymore LUL
[3:03:42] <Blank9> huge buffs
[3:03:45] <Sol_Install> Anime
[3:03:45] <%PinkertonDanPie> I love this one
[3:03:51] <Dr_Mooose> big buff
[3:03:52] <+MisterAvry> no! not Brainy Smurf!
[3:03:54] <Blank9> that's a net gain of 2 levels
[3:03:54] <%Daxalog> Youve almost formed a full personality
[3:03:55] <+purps26> I never got that thought in 2 playthroughs
[3:03:56] <+MetalGearBobo> super cop
[3:03:58] <NeroInfinite> 8 christ
[3:03:59] <%Treuan> That's a lotta percept
[3:03:59] <magboost> God Damn
[3:04:01] <aiutare47> 8
[3:04:01] <PartyFavors> Perception can *easily* hit double digits
[3:04:01] <+evbites> holy shit
[3:04:02] <televisedrevolting> I SEE EVERYTHING
[3:04:02] <jorniev> too big?
[3:04:02] <T_Sasquatch> col ma ma daqua is such a weird name to hear
[3:04:04] <+fetrigon> 8 holy shit
[3:04:06] <Tisaric> gonna be way too perceptive now LUL
[3:04:08] <cis_eraser_420> fuck yeah disco!!
[3:04:09] <SilverFeng> PERCEIVE EVERYTHING
[3:04:10] <+pectusumbra> feels like that's going to start becoming a problem soon
[3:04:12] <magboost> Your a basically a Psychic cop
[3:04:15] <ingman112> Pro tip pat: don’t really need to go higher than 8
[3:04:18] <%ThirdWelles> With that shit, you could probably even hear stuff beyond perception
[3:04:19] <%Mendin> Hey check Info on perception to see what Over High P does
[3:04:20] <sirrice77> that bad reaction speed is gonna bite you in the ass later
[3:04:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> Did Pat already talk to buff guy number 1?
[3:04:32] <+fetrigon> what's max level in this game? 12?
[3:04:32] <ItsPastas> "I CAN FEEL EVERYTHING!"
[3:04:37] <aiutare47> oh yeah 8 is kinda high
[3:04:37] <%dork_doggler> @pectusumbra 6-9 is where you tend to want a stat
[3:04:40] <+MetalGearBobo> wait yeah bois we will litterally perceive to much
[3:04:46] <%Kataguro> Ah yes, Purity
[3:04:47] <ingman112> @reallybigrocks I don’t think so
[3:04:51] <NeroInfinite> oh no
[3:04:56] <+MisterAvry> ahh, that's the racists truck

[3:06:37] <$NoHopeForMyCuirass> I love this character
[3:06:41] <%Blackleafx> rip felix, but this VA is way superior
[3:06:42] <+Jeshk0> fucking scab

[3:07:02] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> sashagreenspiderqueen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! i havent been watching streams much in general but i do love this game and hope it ends up being a full playthrough even if it ends up doing piss numbers
[3:07:04] <%Blackleafx> also fun fact, this guy had a scottish accent on the PS built, because they used the wrong voice set
[3:07:05] <+MisterAvry> yeah, when have cops and strikebreakers ever been seen together...
[3:07:06] <%Mathochism> Why does this voice actor sound like Tetsuya Ida in 13 Sentinels?
[3:07:13] <Bootkiller6> No, his old voice didn't fit
[3:07:15] <chippybippers> @PatStaresAt his OLD voice
[3:07:17] <$NoHopeForMyCuirass> They're talking about the old VA I think
[3:07:24] <+MightyDuckShoes> did Pat spoiler himself?
[3:07:25] <+rainlily1245> fucking pinkerton ass
[3:07:25] <%TheFabledAble> YUUUUUP

[3:07:34] <AhmCha> No no no I'm talking about the old voice
[3:07:36] <+evbites> FUCK THIS GUY
[3:07:36] <Blank9> his old voice was lispy
[3:07:37] <iosephe> the voice of a scab leader
[3:07:39] <cis_eraser_420> hell yeah
[3:07:42] <AhmCha> The one in the old cat
[3:07:43] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> FILTHY SCAB tomatoAngry

[3:07:48] <%TheFabledAble> He's.... A DEEPFAKE

[3:07:51] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> blum-like but not blum
[3:07:53] <ingman112> @mightyduckshoes assume not til proven otherwise

[3:12:14] <%Kataguro> The Limo Wars
[3:12:15] <trickster721> Ha ha ha that's basically what the RCM is...
[3:12:17] <+stoutfish> I liked his old voice acting better
[3:12:17] <faegbeard> cop scab COP SCAB
[3:12:18] <naoi0> It didn't end well.
[3:12:18] <sirtommygunn> casual communist man
[3:12:20] <Tisaric> manana is a bro
[3:12:20] <twohitgood> fuck cops
[3:12:21] <jorniev> not good i guess
[3:12:21] <televisedrevolting> I heard this story.
[3:12:22] <+MetalGearBobo> luigi?
[3:12:22] <T_Sasquatch> Oh no
[3:12:26] <%Ranryu692> Cops went on strike in Boston once, now cops can't strike lol
[3:12:27] <+fetrigon> must've been sick
[3:12:29] <%MuffledEurobeat> *COPlicated
[3:12:33] <+Mrbaconator> fuck cops
[3:12:33] <KaiserMario> Ah yes, the taxi shooting times...
[3:12:34] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Cabbies went to war, right?
[3:12:35] <+stoutfish> the cops went on strike in new york once, and crime went down
[3:12:39] <T_Sasquatch> man its acab until its an issue
[3:12:39] <%Deft_Thought> NANI
[3:12:39] <%Mucmaster> Wasn't there zero increase in crime during the strike too
[3:12:40] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> Cops went on strike in NYC and crime went down LUL
[3:12:40] <magboost> I think NYC had cops do a 1 day strike over here
[3:12:41] <%echobee_tv> Cops? No wayyyyyyy.
[3:12:42] <$Dakuu75> Cops going on strike sounds like a Purge
[3:12:42] <televisedrevolting> I remember him telling this story.
[3:12:42] <Pookiedaexzile> Full you say
[3:12:43] <Sol_Install> hmm hm
[3:12:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> yo cops might be kinda shitty guys
[3:12:47] <twohitgood> cops shouldn't be able to act as a union. their job already has too much leverage and power.
[3:12:49] <%YakumoYomi> *GASP*
[3:12:49] <linSP> hmmmm oh word?
[3:12:50] <+Jeshk0> cops? racist?? o my stars and garters!!
[3:12:55] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  dont forget LGBT people
[3:12:56] <magboost> yup @Atomic_ColliderSG
[3:13:03] <+Atomic_ColliderSG> ACAB
[3:13:07] <T_Sasquatch> uh oh
[3:13:07] <cis_eraser_420> @Dakuu75 it happened in NY, I think, and crime went down lmao
[3:13:07] <televisedrevolting> Is this the Taxi-Limo thing?
[3:13:09] <twohitgood> should have just fired them all and replaced them.
[3:13:09] <mrblack499> just walk out and let crime f em up lol
[3:13:12] <trickster721> Technically if the cops are on strike than crime is zero, like in Japan
[3:13:14] <+trizetacannon44> When the cops striked in New York, crime went down there
[3:13:16] <%NastiCrimeboy> YES
[3:13:22] <aiutare47> @twohitgood EMS cannot legally form unions here, no clue why police are special
[3:13:26] <NeroInfinite> Yeah.
[3:13:27] <%Blackleafx> Police strike? Is this Watchmen?
[3:13:28] <Chatterbox1991> Gun Battles on Taxi Depot rooftops @PatStaresAt
[3:13:29] <%Monkeyweed21> yea Law Enforcement is kind of a neccesity to society functioning
[3:13:33] <%toolofparanoia> that is tru
[3:13:33] <%Blackleafx> jk I know about the montreal strike
[3:13:33] <Admiral_PopnFresh> hehehehehe
[3:13:37] <faegbeard> you don't want literally nocop
[3:13:44] <Sol_Install> Pat is very right about that
[3:13:45] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> Its all or nothing pat
[3:13:46] <%toastybites> @Blackleafx the Murray-Hill riot
[3:13:47] <%dork_doggler> @PatStaresAt You mean something like a Montreal Citizen;'s Milita?
[3:13:48] <Pookiedaexzile> People wouldn't crime if they werent hungry
[3:13:48] <mrblack499> no cop = crime go up lol
[3:13:51] <+stoutfish> abolish all cops imo

[3:15:11] <aiutare47> @Dakuu75 Seattle I believe
[3:15:15] <%Blackleafx> "Police were motivated to strike because of difficult working conditions caused by disarming FLQ-planted bombs" IT all comes back to the FLQ doesnt it

[3:15:44] <SlippedDisco> what the actual shit
[3:15:48] <%NastiCrimeboy> NotLikeThis
[3:15:50] <Arimil75> Kinda like the LA riots where the koreans had to defend their shit from all the rioters.
[3:15:55] <farrellcityking> GUNS!
[3:15:57] <$Dakuu75> @aiutare47 oh yeah, that sounds right
[3:15:58] <%shurtal> a little rioting, as a treat
[3:16:02] <%DiscoMatador> Always Watch out for Roof Canadians
[3:16:03] <+fetrigon> french people are wild yo
[3:16:08] <OmegaDragonR2> no strikes for cops for fuck sake
[3:16:13] <sirtommygunn> cops not allowed to strike
[3:16:17] <hippofant> There is. Ontario essential servicves are also not allowed to strike, including police.
[3:16:23] <+Mrbaconator> this is legit riveting
[3:16:23] <Pookiedaexzile> Alot of Rioting, as a main course
[3:16:25] <mrblack499> all they need is Roof top Korean
[3:16:28] <Sunstalker> Belgium has that? Minimum service has to be provided by police forces
[3:16:34] <cardamomo88> jesus
[3:16:41] <%Ranryu692> most places have that
[3:16:44] <sirtommygunn> there are some things that society can't function without, yeah
[3:16:46] <%thelaxinator> Teachers have been being rolled into essentials as well, this started a few years ago, it's BULLSHIT
[3:16:50] <%ramielthe5th> doge broke .25 cents!
[3:16:51] <%Ranryu692> to varying degrees
[3:16:52] <cis_eraser_420> the thing with strikes is, uh, if you're striking, you're striking
[3:16:53] <magboost> huh
[3:16:54] <+Gespens> Aren't Fire Departments not considered an essential service?
[3:16:54] <%Monkeyweed21> @hippofant if all the cops agree to strike who is going to enforce that
[3:16:57] <%Garthunox> firemen too
[3:16:58] <+icekept> WHAT
[3:17:02] <sirtommygunn> you just gotta accept it as part of working in those fields
[3:17:02] <T_Sasquatch> sureeeee
[3:17:08] <wolfen091> worked with a guy who was old school union electrician in New York, said they would get police escorts to go to other jobs being done by non unions so they could go bust up all the work they did.  not that way anymore, but that negative stigma against unions still remains, sucks cause I'm a union electrician
[3:17:13] <%Dylveryn> that's actually fucking wild, when the NYPD went on strike the city saw less crime committed, when they returned from strike it went up again
[3:17:14] <+illusiveSaint> no striking cops NOPERS
[3:17:15] <%dork_doggler> @Arimil75 that situation was far more complicated, look it up, shit about food deserts and price gouging
[3:17:22] <$Futurecity10> Looked up the Voice actor in the Credits of the final cut, The Scab leader is voiced by some dude called Mack MCGuire, a complete nobody
[3:17:27] <Sol_Install> Yea, Canada isn't that good of a place chat
[3:17:28] <hippofant> @Monkeyweed21 in Quebec, it was the federal government and the military. There's also a federal police force (The RCMP), provincial police forces, and police from other jurisdictions
[3:17:29] <%Monkeyweed21> Nurses and EMTs are by far the worst paid of all emergency workers
[3:17:30] <%Kataguro> Death
[3:17:34] <Pookiedaexzile> What are you gonna do Arrest all the nurses
[3:17:38] <+CandiAndTheBretts> atpCheif atpCheif atpCheif
[3:17:41] <%Ranryu692> nurses go on strike = people die
[3:17:51] <Arimil75> @dork_doggler Still doesn't give anyone the right to destroy someone's livelihood.
[3:17:53] <+fetrigon> oh yeah medical staff in Nigeria also went on strike NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:17:56] <OmegaDragonR2> replace them
[3:17:56] <%bassoontyphoon> Yeah we’ve been trying to improve conditions for nurses/HCPs post COVID and it’s super difficult with these restrictions
[3:18:01] <magboost> FUCK
[3:18:04] <%Garthunox> Here in Ireland nurses strike all the time, cos holy fuck are they underpaid
[3:18:06] <nivlac_555> woooow
[3:18:06] <naoi0> Jesus
[3:18:07] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt New York has that, Im in EMS, we legally CANNOT form unions, no striking none of that shit, threat to public health they say. Also means cant get benefits or anything. Police however are given some special union privileges because everyone is scared of them
[3:18:07] <sirtommygunn> they're probably gonna brutalize the nurses
[3:18:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> holy fuck
[3:18:08] <%dalmek> jesus
[3:18:08] <%Ranryu692> DAMN
[3:18:09] <%Kataguro> Oof

[3:18:13] <%GarbageNirvana> Fuckin reverse career progress
[3:18:14] <%Mucmaster> Thats fucked up
[3:18:14] <cardamomo88> SCUMMY LIKE FUCK
[3:18:16] <Blank9> no strike, just quit
[3:18:17] <%ramielthe5th> thats facism
[3:18:20] <OmegaDragonR2> well thats not good
[3:18:22] <+illusiveSaint> F
[3:18:22] <%dork_doggler> @Arimil75 it does if the liverlihood is parasitism
[3:18:23] <sirtommygunn> oof
[3:18:23] <farrellcityking> DIE DIE DIE DIE!!!!
[3:18:24] <%MoguManda> @arimil75 that shit was racist, stop and read some shit
[3:18:25] <%Garthunox> WHAT THE FUCK?
[3:18:26] <Sol_Install> That's really fucking bad
[3:18:27] <+keyoray> Is quitting the same as striking?
[3:18:28] <%bassoontyphoon> Yyyyup
[3:18:29] <%Solarint> essential services going on strike is a lot different than making some random consumer good
[3:18:30] <%Maids4lyfe> they're supposed to save lives, fuck 'em
[3:18:31] <%Garthunox> THATS FACISM!?
[3:18:33] <NeroInfinite> F
[3:18:34] <+MisterAvry> CON damage
[3:18:36] <naoi0> Scab?
[3:18:36] <%Blackleafx> The Reagan tactic?
[3:18:37] <magboost> Thats Supepr EVIL
[3:18:40] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> thats the kind of thing you should burn your government down for what the fuck
[3:18:41] <%bread_assassin> Oh
[3:18:42] <mrblack499> just dont show up to work and don't call it a strike
[3:18:43] <jorniev> FACISM
[3:18:44] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  was that permenant?
[3:18:45] <OmegaDragonR2> strongarmed
[3:18:47] <%toolofparanoia> IS THIS A FASCISM?!
[3:18:50] <T_Sasquatch> that sounds fucky
[3:18:58] <hippofant> Boy, I'd love to go to a hospital with ALL NEW NURSES throughout the whole building on that day.
[3:18:59] <Pookiedaexzile> So You're saying THe nurses should have guns
[3:18:59] <ThirdPersonPhil> Isn't this like short selling? At some point people have nothign to lose anymore.
[3:18:59] <%Blackleafx> Reagan fired all the government employees when the air trafic staff striked
[3:19:01] <%thelaxinator> Currently we are failing to hire more nurses in ontario despite people dying due to full capacity
[3:19:01] <%dork_doggler> Sounds like montreal unions need paramilitary wings
[3:19:03] <aiutare47> YUP
[3:19:03] <Admiral_PopnFresh> it be how union negotiations go, unfortunately
[3:19:06] <Blank9> in every other job I've been at, if you striked you'd be fired anyway
[3:19:07] <farrellcityking> 10 racks
[3:19:07] <+kullumanati> That’s f stupid
[3:19:09] <%Blackleafx> US air traffic unions have never recovered since
[3:19:12] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> thats KIND of the point of the strike
[3:19:13] <%Monkeyweed21> @Maids4lyfe god forbid people with some of the shittiest jobs ever want decent working conditions
[3:19:14] <jorniev> YOU GUYS ARE LUCKY THEY DIDNT BURN THE GOVERMENT DOWN
[3:19:17] <%Maids4lyfe> that's not fascism striking nurses put people's lives at stake for crying out loud
[3:19:20] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> This just seems like an outline for terrorism targets
[3:19:23] <Admiral_PopnFresh> like the US
[3:19:23] <robert_orri> this sounds like good old Moralism
[3:19:24] <cardamomo88> LIKE THE USA
[3:19:26] <DianaTheAscian> so jut like in the states
[3:19:26] <%GarbageNirvana> Fuck it, back to feudalism
[3:19:29] <Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt  paramedics use the Subway?
[3:19:32] <+Proxzo> Disco Canadian
[3:19:34] <+illusiveSaint> NYC MTA workers went on strike a few years it was inconvenient but not terrible
[3:19:35] <taquito_blade> is traffic congestion really that bad?
[3:19:37] <naoi0> Return to monke
[3:19:40] <+Shadowofadoubt> @Maids4lyfe pay the nurses better then
[3:19:46] <magboost> YEs
[3:19:46] <+Proxzo> As a US citizen this like learning about the Pale.
[3:19:47] <Chatterbox1991> ooooooooh
[3:19:48] <+LionKagura> @Chatterbox1991 cmonBruh
[3:19:49] <$NoHopeForMyCuirass> That's an interesting approach to the problem
[3:19:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Burn the Means of Production
[3:19:55] <Chatterbox1991> that's smart actually
[3:19:59] <$Futurecity10> The onyl way to change is to murder your leaders. France had the right idea
[3:20:02] <NeroInfinite> There's a volunteer fire station ltieralyl minutes from my neighborhood.
[3:20:03] <aiutare47> @Proxzo it happens here too
[3:20:05] <magboost> Thats why you never buy a car in a big city @taquito_blade
[3:20:07] <+Delenay> old city
[3:20:08] <ThirdPersonPhil> Does everyone on montreal owns a car?
[3:20:09] <Admiral_PopnFresh> return to monke
[3:20:10] <farrellcityking> At least they didn’t attack attack the capitol like some places
[3:20:11] <%Lion_kun> Montreal sounds like a shitty place to live.
[3:20:13] <%bevyrage> @Maids4lyfe the strike is for better work conditions dude, refusing to improve the conditions of an essential worker and blaming it on them being selfish is not a good moral ground to stand on
[3:20:13] <+illusiveSaint> complete canadian saturation
[3:20:14] <T_Sasquatch> its weird, for the world to work, some people simply have to do shit jobs or else we cant function
[3:20:15] <%ssjklyco> Shutting down one thing will affect 20 other things situation
[3:20:16] <+athuramn> so what did the cops in Ontario and Quebec do? Run a bunch of "we need minorities" campaign, but actually increase the amount of nepotistic hires to basically make the entire force a union
[3:20:16] <%ramielthe5th> well keep nurses out of strike, its not like they are asking for impossible shit :p
[3:20:17] <$Dakuu75> everything in US is cars, that's why it takes 30-40 minutes fore any emergency services to arrive
[3:20:19] <+synthiis> isn't already the case with construction?
[3:20:21] <taquito_blade> @magboost like in NY
[3:20:26] <Chatterbox1991> @LionKagura the way he phrased it made me think paramedics use the metro
[3:20:28] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt u see the videos of traffic holding up ambulances trying to rush somewhere?
[3:20:29] <%shurtal> Modern City with ANCIENT City Design
[3:20:29] <Blank9> all they're doing is disincentivizing people to become a nurse/fireman/etc., but just as well because they'd fire them otherwise
[3:20:32] <cardamomo88> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis CRINGE
[3:20:33] <sirtommygunn> That's why American cities have so much god damn traffic, no trains and barely any buses
[3:20:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> Punisher logos and shit?
[3:20:37] <+darkpulse703> do they need more/closer emergency service locations? monkaW too get to places faster
[3:20:54] <+LionKagura> @Chatterbox1991 your brain must be smooth lol
[3:20:55] <%Fooguwu> maybe dont strike if it kills a lot of people
[3:20:56] <OmegaDragonR2> in the face of that level of punishment what can you do protest?
[3:20:59] <jorniev> but
[3:20:59] <magboost> Driving in NY sucks its why I try to stick to subways @taquito_blade
[3:21:02] <%MoguManda> if it's life or death maybe they should be treated well
[3:21:03] <syzmachine> based and infrastructurepilled
[3:21:04] <ThirdPersonPhil> Yeah but the pay should be good
[3:21:05] <+Shadowofadoubt> they should be the best paid individuals in that country then
[3:21:07] <%Solarint> the compromise is to not treat nurses like shit
[3:21:14] <Blank9> You protest by quitting.
[3:21:15] <SlippedDisco> whole-heartedly agree
[3:21:17] <cardamomo88> PAY MORE
[3:21:21] <+keyoray> can they be closed for specific hours? like 8 hours a day?
[3:21:21] <%dork_doggler> VabndaLISM?
[3:21:22] <+JustToWatch> also police unions are terrible
[3:21:22] <%Monkeyweed21> Then pay nurses and EMTs a decent wage
[3:21:22] <+fetrigon> That definitely happened in Nigeria NotLikeThis
[3:21:25] <OmegaDragonR2> ?
[3:21:25] <T_Sasquatch> just make more money 4Head
[3:21:25] <+PkSilent01> 0
[3:21:25] <iosephe> vacations?
[3:21:26] <Pookiedaexzile> Slow downs
[3:21:27] <Blank9> Or just going slow on beaurocratic paperwork.
[3:21:28] <%king_wragles> Work slow
[3:21:29] <sirtommygunn> You can still strike, it's just extremely high stakes
[3:21:31] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> show up and fuck off?
[3:21:32] <%ssjklyco> Covid is a good example of how shit can get fucked when things have to shut down.
[3:21:33] <+trizetacannon44> Slowdown?
[3:21:34] <jorniev> KILLING PEOPLE
[3:21:36] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[3:21:40] <magboost> Maybe the compromise is to no-Pay your NUrses like shit
[3:21:41] <mrblack499> right to work would fix that lol
[3:21:44] <OmegaDragonR2> go elsewhere
[3:21:44] <NeroInfinite> YEP.

[3:21:57] <naoi0> Globalization is a fuck
[3:21:57] <taquito_blade> ah smart, offer to someone who actually needs the srvices
[3:21:58] <%Solarint> America ruins everyting
[3:21:59] <SlippedDisco> oh. oh that's a bad brain drain.
[3:21:59] <+keyoray> Capitalism
[3:21:59] <%ramielthe5th> and then they get overworked to death
[3:21:59] <KaiserMario> The "health exodus"
[3:21:59] <%NastiCrimeboy> AH I see
[3:21:59] <%GarbageNirvana> Our insurance companies are runaway trains, hop on
[3:21:59] <%VeryBestPlot> VeryBestPlot subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[3:22:00] <Sol_Install> That was fun
[3:22:01] <DianaTheAscian> Checks out
[3:22:01] <@SoFarFetched> the more we know
[3:22:04] <%MelBrooksKA> U S A! U S A!
[3:22:04] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt in America, medical staff just stop taking insurance info, no money, patient gets treated, cant get sued
[3:22:06] <sirtommygunn> oof
[3:22:06] <cardamomo88> ARE NO THE US ALSO FUCK IN THAT REGARD
[3:22:06] <ThirdPersonPhil> Doctors always get away
[3:22:07] <Pookiedaexzile> We Stole the Vaccines and Nurses with our USD
[3:22:07] <$Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt interesting. thank you.
[3:22:07] <+Mrbaconator> Pat IRL encyclopedia check
[3:22:07] <syzmachine> the doctor faction sounds too powerful
[3:22:08] <%Maids4lyfe> see that's better
[3:22:09] <OmegaDragonR2> wouldnt have a shortage if they changed pay but hey ho
[3:22:10] <@SoFarFetched> Thank you Dr. Professor Pat.
[3:22:12] <+Delenay> interesting stuff like this is part of why im here lol
[3:22:13] <WakeUpThrow> Very much did, ty Pat
[3:22:14] <jorniev> I DID
[3:22:15] <+darkpulse703> monkaS NA healthcare cost
[3:22:16] <Sol_Install> thanks for the small history lesson
[3:22:18] <%Garthunox> SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE AMERICAS ARE FUCKED
[3:22:21] <%YakumoYomi> That was actually informative. Thank you, Patty Cakes
[3:22:24] <%toolofparanoia> ... america wins again i guess. Thank, Hat country!
[3:22:25] <+illusiveSaint> lol seque to "hes a chatty guy"
[3:22:26] <%Garthunox> oops, didnt mean all caps
[3:22:32] <%bassoontyphoon> @patstaresat not to mention the fact that the starting wages for nurses in Ontario is 9/hr more than in quebec
[3:22:32] <SlippedDisco> that was a great encyclopedia check, thank you for that
[3:22:35] <%thelaxinator> Canada usually imports Nurses but they have to re-train which makes it very unappetizing for them in direct comparison
[3:22:47] <Deasmeister> Work to rule is usually the compromise
[3:22:47] <+illusiveSaint> manana reminds me of juan luis guerra
[3:22:48] <magboost> @Garthunox Were American, were always fucked
[3:22:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> America has some of the greatest healthcare in the world but most of the country can't afford it
[3:22:56] <$NoHopeForMyCuirass> "Just don't pay your nurses shit" is kicking the goddamn can chat, the point is there will be conflicts but you can't afford to gum up the works when lives are on the line
[3:23:03] <%Blackleafx> SCARY BLACKMAN
[3:23:05] <SlippedDisco> monkaS
[3:23:07] <%dork_doggler> @PatStaresAt "There's gotta be some kinda compromise" sounds very centrist Pat

[3:30:29] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> @Mrbaconator hes saying communism is race failure
[3:30:31] <%dork_doggler> "communism is responsible for international capital dominance"
[3:30:35] <%Blackleafx> @Chatterbox1991 afaik the devs said two of the main inspirations for measurehead are a lebanese guy and a native american so, go wild
[3:30:36] <%Kataguro> That last bit is pretty on point

[3:31:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Hotep Levels are Strong with this one
[3:31:26] <%Lion_kun> Wait, is measurehead black? it's hard to tell.
[3:31:27] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @Mrbaconator let me tell you about *advanced* race theory: the game
[3:31:28] <sirtommygunn> CULTURAL VICTORY
[3:31:29] <EternalJedi> this guy is good at Civ
[3:31:44] <pokefan9956> I always thought measurehead was, like, samoan or something
[3:31:45] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @Mrbaconator its literally just a contrived new form of chauvinism hes invented
[3:31:46] <+BeeComfy> twitch is having display issues in full screen mode, not the stream the site itself. anyone else have this problem. An add plays and it does get back to the stream?
[3:31:46] <cardamomo88> BOI
[3:31:49] <ingman112> Like the pale is out there and fucks like this guy still exist
[3:31:51] <+ClickyButtons> I have no fucking clue whats happening right now
[3:31:55] <%thelaxinator> This is one of those guys where you could steer the conversation in any direction and he'd still swerve back onto his vegan diet
[3:31:55] <%Blackleafx> HES A FAKER
[3:32:00] <%Mucmaster> @Mrbaconator his rascism runs deeper than skin
[3:32:02] <Bootkiller6> Measurehead's racism is so advanced he has prestige levels
[3:32:02] <$NoHopeForMyCuirass> Honestly I'm surprised I haven't seen more people like this. Just take "race theory" and apply it to whites, who by fascists of old would appear to be a stagnant ascendancy
[3:32:06] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @lion_kun measurehead is beyond your silly notions of black and white, he is superior
[3:32:08] <Blank9> measurehead's either black or samoan
[3:32:08] <muXPerience> that's blackface
[3:32:09] <+illusiveSaint> i think hes supposed to be ambigious on purpose to have your imagination go wild
[3:32:10] <jorniev> you can get +1 from weight lifting for the red check, it helped me a lot
[3:32:10] <Schrozz> Race is whatever it needs to be to instill a false natural hierarchy thats sociology 101 baby
[3:32:11] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @pokefan9956 hes like AU louis farrakhan went super saiyan
[3:32:11] <+MetalGearBobo> fucking civ top 500 player
[3:32:12] <+Jeshk0> even worse, hes a RATIONALIST
[3:32:13] <%Dylveryn> @lion_kun yeah he's a black supremacist
[3:32:15] <+Mrbaconator> @Mucmaster that makes no sense to me

[4:32:10] <%Blackleafx> @PatStaresAt You have the dense Not-Russian novel too, that you never read

[4:33:14] <yeeyeyee> Communism could have succeeded if the liberals hadn't jumped ship, and joyce will tell you as much herself
[4:33:20] <Ravioli_Ronin> Fuck the coalition, also I might want to use the coalition to fuck the union. Very mixed feelings
[4:33:22] <%Blackleafx> oh no

[4:33:44] <ZE_Count> cook ya a stew
[4:33:45] <%dork_doggler> @VyperVic That's actually not a reason any communist regimes have failed. Even the Khmer Rouge only collpased because they managed to piss off Vietnam.

[4:48:29] <Bootkiller6> There's an achievement for reaching an all-time low with Kim, but I don't know if I could possibly do it because I love Kim too much
[4:48:34] <WakeUpThrow> That's a hard sell
[4:48:35] <%Monkeyweed21> what about Kingdom Hearts
[4:48:36] <thetunnelhomer> I wish Torment aged better.
[4:48:41] <%MelBrooksKA> Wasn't that a big influence on this game ?
[4:48:41] <%Ynkubus_> Couldnt have a reasonable husbando, like a skeleton could you?
[4:48:45] <cis_eraser_420> hot take bomb: disco is better than torment bc it ditched combat

[4:50:09] <user_naim> I still want Novistadors
[4:50:10] <Estwilde> @MelBrooksKA ZAUM did post a steam curated list of games that were inspirations for them. Planescape was at the top of the list when I looked :)
[4:50:11] <Crippl3> @PatStaresAt Sacred & Terrible Air is the lead writer's novel that this game takes place in
[4:50:15] <user_naim> fucking love novistadors
[4:50:26] <cis_eraser_420> @cis_eraser_420 yeah, I mostly added that disclaimer bc i know some people could get REALLY heated about that
[4:50:37] <aiutare47> @PatStaresAt This game is inspired/an extension of a book, that is the book
[4:50:43] <Bootkiller6> @Ranryu692 Yeah the only reason I'm watching is because I already played through this game back when it first launched
