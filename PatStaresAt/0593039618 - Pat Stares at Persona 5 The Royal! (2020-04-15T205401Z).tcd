[0:04:50] <fragdar> i'm surprised that pat will stream p5r.. i thought he was going to do a only ff7 week

[0:37:55] <%weissguard> psaPorgmo
[0:37:58] <%thenumber5point5> Bathed my ex's cat once, ended up with a cat claw threw my bottom lip
[0:37:58] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> can't you just wash him down with a wet rag?
[0:37:59] <%Movemeister> Just put some orange juice in the bath
[0:38:02] <Ipsenscastle> Cats arent really supposed to be bathed anyway
[0:38:13] <NatetheHunter> why was paige bathing your cat with two men
[0:38:14] <%maenos2> Just throw him into that enclosed shower thing.
[0:38:14] <%floralkami> @patstaresat you aren't supposed to just put the cat in there, you have to EEEEEEAAAASE them into it with a water cup
[0:38:16] <%sund0wner> They clean themselves to an extent
[0:38:16] <%valriot> Cats love brush
[0:38:21] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[0:38:22] <fenrirmitsuki> Cats are self-cleaning, anyway.
[0:38:23] <%Legato_Ambrose> Seriously, cats don't need baths
[0:38:24] <%Jekado> yeah they self clean
[0:38:24] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah I never wash my cat since they are indoors.
[0:38:26] <PirateMike_> Everytime I brush my hair my cat runs over to me
[0:38:27] <+Neoripo> Tar?
[0:38:29] <%sund0wner> Yeah if they fucking maimed or covered in dook
[0:38:30] <%Legato_Ambrose> except for fleas
[0:38:31] <%Alopekis> You really don't have to bath cats that often.
[0:38:31] <Sartastic> or when theyre old
[0:38:31] <%CelioHogane> I mean...
[0:38:32] <%maenos2> so...elmo then
[0:38:33] <%sund0wner> Get*
[0:38:33] <%starotter70> The Pro-Elmo Moves
[0:38:33] <SilverFaustX> cats are selfcleaning
[0:38:34] <%Jekado> washing them is bad generally
[0:38:34] <%Laecerelius> Cat love brush yeah yeah yeah!
[0:38:36] <%Valdorick> Combings are good enough.
[0:38:36] <%GarbageNirvana> Basically if the cat cleaning itself would make it sick
[0:38:36] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[0:38:37] <+Tarage> My maine coon gets super tufted fur. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I can't brush her fast enough.
[0:38:38] <Manmadeawesome> I have never bathed my cat and she is not stinky
[0:38:38] <%Maids4lyfe> only bathe if extremely filthy
[0:38:39] <BluBox> But... only once?
[0:38:39] <%OmniSTylez> LUL
[0:38:40] <%valriot> Cats are the roomba of animals
[0:38:41] <+Remery_> When they get old, they become too lazy to clean themselves
[0:38:42] <+Merhabi> if they are unable to bathe themselves
[0:38:42] <%narusao> they're like blue jeans. they don't need to be washed regularly
[0:38:44] <%Yautjabutts> relatable.
[0:38:45] <%Valdorick> For everything else, there's cat wipes.

[0:38:45] <%dekkitout> Oh Elmo~
[0:38:46] <%reinbachthe3rd> My sister had one of those naked cats. You have to wash those ones all the time. They get skin rashes.

[0:38:54] <%BubbaRands> psaPorgmo
[0:38:56] <%sund0wner> Imagine a human child doing that
[0:39:01] <rudiciuscaesar> Cats only need a bath to get stuff off and out of their fur. Like, if they get into anything that can stain their fur. You gotta beat them to it or they will clean it off and probably become a supervillain.
[0:39:01] <%Alig200> did you like it though?
[0:39:01] <%Yautjabutts> You wash you cat with a rag on a stick
[0:39:02] <%Persona_EX> ewww
[0:39:02] <%Meidolaon> Meidolaon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months, currently on a 35 month streak! Oh sick, one more month until three years!

[0:39:05] <%Jekado> yeah i've washed cat parts when they get messy
[0:39:06] <%sund0wner> Scratch that they probably do it every 5 minutes
[0:39:08] <%dekkitout> He no likey bum wipe?
[0:39:12] <%Roundelay11> sometimes elderly cats do need help cleaning themselves so they need a bath occaisionally
[0:39:14] <%Yautjabutts> Hey Pat. Did you get those secret P5 Avatars/Themes after completing the first palace? Apparently it's like 4 different themes and 14 avatars for your PS4. It's one of those secret sony promo things

[0:45:55] <%Binary_Fireball> I feel like you have to do a lot to get banned in here tbh

[0:46:45] <%rabbi_hyman_krustofsky> @CopperTucker Do the mechanics still hold up/are they enjoyable? I am currently finally playing Kingdom Hearts and some of the quite outdated mechanics are hair-tearing frustration.
[0:46:46] <%j0ustar> Strident does the lord's work
[0:46:47] <%Kirby_Sauce> stri is a good boy

[0:47:00] <%Bane_Kaikyo> That does NOT MEAN you go and annoy Strident
[0:47:03] <%Roundelay11> theres even an entire chat room in the discord for FF7
[0:47:03] <@SoFarFetched> Please don't message Pat about being banned by mods people.
[0:47:06] <%Valdorick> "I just posted full bodied anime tiddies and dicks"
[0:47:07] <cham52> But Pat, do you not ban every person in the discord yourself?
[0:47:07] <+budyd> Ruthless... I love it.

[0:47:14] <%optimasmaximas> strident is a merciful god in a cruel word
[0:47:15] <%GabeSweetMan> The Stri in Strident stands for Strick. And we appreciate him for it!
[0:47:16] <%Verd_254> I suppose this is a good time to mention there's a disconnect in the community with spoilers on FF7R, some streamers ban for FF7 original spoilers some only ban for remake spoilers.
[0:47:16] <@SoFarFetched> Pat entrusted us with the Ban Hammer for a reason.
[0:47:17] <BluBox> How hard is it to not be a dumdum?
[0:47:19] <%starotter70> That speed is more impressive than anything
[0:47:19] <@StridentSong> Thank you Pat
[0:47:21] <%weissguard> @numjoy Oh, that's actually real nice. I heard Pat say to just get to 80 beforehand, I just wanted to double check before I kept going. Especially since I wanted to keep going through all the way to Shadowbringers. Thanks for the reply dude.

[0:54:36] <dogwelder02> dogwelder02 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:54:36] <omen_setter> strong opinions about FF7 have been gestating for 23 years
[0:54:37] <%SirGO0SE> because Tifa likes it rough
[0:54:38] <%Persona_EX> i mean how hard is it when someone tells you NOT to do something and 2 seconds later you post spoilers in main chat. A Channel was made for FF7 spoilers in the discord and someone like 1 minute after strident pinged everyone 2 people got banned for just being in general blabbing

[0:54:44] <%Ascethetic> FF7, WHAT IS THIS WEEB GAME FOR CHILDREN
[0:54:44] <%GabeSweetMan> The part about Sovereign Citizens that cracks me up the most is that those charters were valid for barely like 4 years and have not been legally binding for over 200. The Charter of Confederacy were barely followed in the first place lol.

[1:28:40] <+dredayy56> Shaquille o’neal?
[1:28:40] <%figleafplays> stealing is the big bad
[1:28:41] <RogueMinja> One year no crimes.
[1:28:41] <%ShogunNoonto> but stealing is fun
[1:28:42] <%ShichiNoBushi> One crimes, no year.
[1:28:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LIE STEAT CHEAL
[1:28:43] <PirateMike_> Only steal if you can get away with it
[1:28:45] <CrazyMedicine> One Year, 1 Billion crimes
[1:28:45] <%Movemeister> Don't get caught stealing
[1:28:46] <%Klefth> UGH, jesus fucking christ, they butcher Yusuke's last name even WORSE than Ryuji's
[1:28:47] <%figleafplays> stealing hearts is ok
[1:28:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> Hey. Mindrape isn't stealing, to be fair
[1:28:49] <%floralkami> that's rich coming from YOU, Pat

[1:29:00] <+rnewman> Don’t get -caught- stealing
[1:29:05] <illTemperedSeaBass> The Phantom Thieves steal from the rich and give to the needy. They take a small percentage, but they're not greedy.

[1:46:11] <zenorot> I didn't notice the first time but when I did it was so obvious
[1:46:12] <%suikudo> Parents abandon children @PatStaresAt
[1:46:13] <%Run44forrest> woopsHmm
[1:46:13] <%Valdorick> By being a Necromancer
[1:46:14] <redrins> you can make them orphans
[1:46:17] <SilverFaustX> abondoned
[1:46:17] <%hzealot> @PatStaresAt you have to be a necromancer and kill the parents and then revive them in front of the kids
[1:46:17] <%starotter70> Kill the Parents to save the Orphans
[1:46:19] <%Razputin217> Kiryu
[1:46:20] <+knowyourenemy_97> Spider Man
[1:46:25] <heartlesshealer> No, it's Batman because of all the Robins
[1:46:26] <missingangle> You kill the parents real good
[1:46:26] <%Run44forrest> c805Hmm

[1:46:39] <%Th3SmartAlec> "Dick-Twist"
[1:46:40] <%Run44forrest> c805Hmm try orphans
[1:46:40] <%Fooguwu> Art Farm
[1:46:44] <KawaiiJetty> Kiryu palace would have tigers with eyepatches
[1:46:44] <+fingalights> Orphans numbers are dropping. We must kill more parents
[1:46:44] <silver__viii> Farm was a good guess tbf
[1:46:45] <dabeaminator> His distortion is that they still have parents
[1:46:47] <+CourageTheCat> shack
[1:46:47] <%cvp5127> sweatshop
[1:46:47] <%Kirby_Sauce> only if you're so addicted to saving orphans that you go out of your way to make orphans
[1:46:48] <%reonome> just read the dictionary
[1:46:50] <%Fooguwu> Alien Art Farm
[1:46:51] <%valriot> Orphanarium
[1:46:52] <BlueLunecy> Sometimes I wonder how they ever got this far

[1:47:07] <fenrirmitsuki> Ah, the art farm.
[1:47:07] <%MakotoPB> They are children
[1:47:10] <%optimasmaximas> yes
[1:47:11] <%Spec7re> They are pretty dumb
[1:47:12] <zenorot> The dragon of Dojima would have an orphan palace
[1:47:13] <%ChaosAethr> Yes
[1:47:13] <supertrigun> It's like choosing D on a True or False
[1:47:14] <brachydios777> Is it possible to change someones heart to a badguy?
[1:47:14] <%around_40_jobbers> Haru is ok
[1:47:15] <%GohanHitsugaya> Correct.
[1:47:16] <silver__viii> True, True
[1:47:17] <%starotter70> Pretty much
[1:47:17] <%weissguard> Especially Futaba
[1:47:17] <+RadDude6969> that is true
[1:47:17] <%j0ustar> truth
[1:47:18] <%McSoliace> true
[1:47:19] <%Th3SmartAlec> psaVoteYea
[1:47:19] <+knowyourenemy_97> Kidnapping kids is evil unless the parents are evil
[1:47:21] <Zayasu> they are pretty stupid until makoto joins LUL
[1:47:22] <dabeaminator> Garden Palace would be sick
[1:47:23] <+GingerStrawhat> Also kinda Akechi
[1:47:23] <%BoomerUnchained> She is
[1:47:24] <gekizenbu> Really vs For Real
[1:47:24] <%AllenDeadman> haru is smart tho
[1:47:24] <%Daniel_Is_I> Haru is an airhead but she's not dumb
[1:47:24] <%MonsterEnvy> Yusuke is pretty clever just weird
[1:47:27] <Manmadeawesome> Haru isnt dumb just useless
[1:47:29] <%Dr00_PhD> Yusuke is actually pretty smart when he joins
[1:47:29] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> She's keeps the secret as well as one.
[1:47:30] <themightyseptopus> Makoto aint too bright either tbh
[1:47:31] <dohrge> Paige is too a phantom thief
[1:47:33] <+knowyourenemy_97> Yusuke ain't that dum tho
[1:47:33] <+Neoripo> Poor Haru
[1:47:33] <%optimasmaximas> monkaS paige a phantom thief?
[1:47:34] <%ChaosAethr> I Fucking Hate Gold
[1:47:35] <%spiritofmojave> Haru's pretty smart to upkeep a business
[1:47:35] <megaman_sentinel> that is so true
[1:47:37] <+RadDude6969> Morgana at least knows metaverse stuff
[1:47:40] <Huntercd> Haru isn't dumb
[1:47:42] <Maleicus> what a dumb cat
[1:47:46] <Judeknight> Makoto is basically the second in command
[1:47:48] <%Like51bears> Pats palace is a garbage dump
[1:47:48] <%MonsterEnvy> Nope
[1:47:49] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL

[1:48:17] <%espanishcanamurciana> Ann = daredevil cat woman !
[1:48:17] <%psydaku> thats a new line
[1:48:18] <silver__viii> Gold, the most pretentious of colors
[1:48:20] <zenorot> Futaba not smart she just read the script
[1:48:21] <%Typhaeon> Blue, gold and silver is so hideous
[1:48:22] <%Kirby_Sauce> tell that to the imperium of mankind
[1:48:23] <%MakotoPB> I love GOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLD
[1:48:23] <%GabeSweetMan> Gold makes a fantastic ACCENT color.

[1:50:58] <fenrirmitsuki> You know, Pat jokes about taking his dick out on stream, but it does make me curious. I mean, with how short he is, his dick must look bigger by proportion.

[2:47:24] <Jetsfantasy> Yeah, Kamoshida's arc is too good to be the intro
[2:47:25] <mr_slaide> I dunno, he's still a pretty big asshole.
[2:47:26] <Oqzar> nah. start with the better one
[2:47:28] <%Run44forrest> yeah but then what about ann

[2:47:30] <%Spec7re> uuuuuh

[2:47:32] <+evbites> nah rapist more important
[2:47:34] <Fear_Ranjer> "Plagiarism is such an ugly word"
[2:47:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> The first also makes the Ann thing kinda.... EHHHHHH
[2:47:36] <%JohnAtDawn> There really should have been at least one more political target
[2:47:36] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Dickbutt the highest form of art octoThicc
[2:47:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> his palace is pretty tho
[2:47:37] <%CappuccinoGuil> I dunno, feels like plagiarism with extra steps
[2:47:38] <+knowyourenemy_97> Madarame is a lame villain
[2:47:39] <+DarkNerdShawny> Nah, Kamoshida makes the game starts off strong
[2:47:40] <%j0ustar> Yusuke is just a real-life sims "Art gremlin"
[2:47:40] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> There's a argument to be made to starting strong.
[2:47:42] <supertrigun> Kanoshiro gets Ryuji and ANN involved
[2:47:45] <%Totally_not_toby> how bad Kamoshida is makes you think they wrote him and went "man this is awful we should dial it back"
[2:47:45] <fenrirmitsuki> I am but a moth, and I love this gaslight!
[2:47:46] <mr_slaide> I thinkl that Haru's father is possible the mildest.
[2:47:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Sadly Artists buying other artists ideas is a thing
[2:47:48] <%maenos2> @eldritchhorrortwitchchat no that's Loas.jpg
[2:47:49] <%valriot> Shouldve been Okamaru cos HARU SCREENTIME LUL

[2:47:51] <%maenos2> loss
[2:47:54] <Zombrocom> How? They were all fucked over by kamoshida, that's how the group gets formed, this guy is completely unrelated to them
[2:47:55] <%Valdorick> Artist block? Like when you see an artist you like, and then ask them for increasingly stranger stuff until they block you on twitter!?
[2:47:57] <%Run44forrest> @joryho woopsR woops ***
[2:47:57] <zenorot> But Akechi is a murderer
[2:47:57] <%Czar_Kazem> he ruins lives tho
[2:47:57] <%dekkitout> Enabling =/= helping
[2:47:57] <%kyh9> Why do you think this should have been the first arc?
[2:47:58] <%weissguard> Yep. Flesh out Ann as a character, have the boys reign in Yusuke initially.
[2:47:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> There are plenty of artists that get by on other's works
[2:48:00] <%CappuccinoGuil> Damn, Yusuke has a deep voice
[2:48:01] <usurper_sos> !
[2:48:02] <heartlesshealer> madarame needs setup considering the character relations though. I guess that was the problem with the order
[2:48:04] <+evbites> has your master ever painted
[2:48:05] <%maenos2> Loss is the highest art form
[2:48:05] <Aydarkzero> the... others...
[2:48:06] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Kamoshida has to be strong in order to give them a strong narrative hook to continue their Phantom Thief work

[2:49:37] <2deep5u> everything for art
[2:49:39] <SweetCuppingCake> Yeah, I really hate that part of Yusuke
[2:49:40] <heartlesshealer> the most non-sexy enthusiasm for nudes
[2:49:41] <%ToxInjection> this part is a bit hmmmmm
[2:49:42] <+GingerStrawhat> Yusuke really is just weird
[2:49:44] <Monkeyweed21> WONT THIS GET MADARAME ARRESTED?
[2:49:44] <+kaniasaurus> I think Yusuke gets a pass because he's just crazy about art
[2:49:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> REMEMBER KAMOSHIDA
[2:49:45] <%GabeSweetMan> It's WAY less nefarious than it sounds at first.
[2:49:45] <%Spec7re> aint that bad??
[2:49:46] <Ipsenscastle> Yusuke is terrible
[2:49:48] <fenrirmitsuki> Kamoshida 2: Electric Boogaloo.
[2:49:48] <zenorot> hentai protagonist
[2:49:48] <%Ancopro> ITS TRUE

[2:49:52] <Fear_Ranjer> Ain't sexual exploitation FUNNY GAMERZ??
[2:49:53] <%the1truefaraldo> AIN'T THAT BAD COUNTER RIME
[2:49:54] <%Totally_not_toby> Yusuke is an insane person warped by a lifetime of abuse so you kinda feel bad for him
[2:49:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> Honestly when you do life drawings you don't see shit
[2:49:55] <%Ancopro> Lifedrawing bro
[2:49:57] <%TalisKanju> Fuck off Hashino
[2:49:57] <%CursedNobleman> Yusuke is such a loser. Plague can do better LUL
[2:49:57] <%Shadowtalon77> Lets go Yusuke's palace instead
[2:49:59] <%SvenHolgersson> Yusuke has no idea what he's askin
[2:49:59] <+evbites> he sees shapes
[2:49:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> SHIHO IS STILL IN A COMA
[2:50:00] <Damie904> Now Pat, to be fair. While Yusuke is a scumbag for this, he has ZERO sex drive.
[2:50:01] <%ToxInjection> He gets shit for it later at least
[2:50:01] <%valriot> LEMME DRAW YOUR FOREIGN ASSHOLE
[2:50:02] <SweetCuppingCake> Yusuke is just really dumb but I hate this interaction
[2:50:03] <%worldbrand> LUL
[2:50:03] <%GabeSweetMan> Tits are FUCKING NON-EXISTENT TO ME
[2:50:04] <%pectusumbra> Nude models are super common
[2:50:05] <+DarkNerdShawny> thats, worse?
[2:50:05] <%ChaosAethr> Yes
[2:50:05] <BluBox> It's true
[2:50:05] <+Merhabi> Plus nude painting Is so boring? it's literally a student exercise.
[2:50:06] <%Binary_Fireball> titty becomes boring
[2:50:06] <%Run44forrest> Kappa
[2:50:06] <filialpails> titty just shapes
[2:50:07] <%LaughingCatt> yup

[2:50:09] <%TimetodiveLTX> tiddy exposure
[2:50:10] <Thalchampz> yeah...
[2:50:10] <%GabeSweetMan> IT'S SO TRUE
[2:50:10] <%zeif00> You just see orb
[2:50:10] <+knowyourenemy_97> Yusuke in P4 > Yusuke P5
[2:50:11] <whitemage4life> Ryuji is like a dumb dog in human form. So he must be a Toradora reference
[2:50:11] <%Valdorick> Tiddy desenitizeation.
[2:50:12] <Jetsfantasy> Similar to medical work, you can become insensitive
[2:50:12] <+Remery_> They paint the Penis too
[2:50:12] <%hzealot> he even said he doesnt see her as girl just boobies
[2:50:12] <%Like51bears> Yes it literally stops being tiddy in 5 mins
[2:50:13] <%SvenHolgersson> I OONLY GET BONERS FOR ART THOT
[2:50:13] <SquigglyLizard> its true
[2:50:13] <+evbites> plauge sees the titty
[2:50:13] <%cherrycottontail> YES ITS ACCURATE I took 3 years of figure drawing
[2:50:14] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[2:50:14] <%SH1NK1R0> Why did inconveniences sound so sensual?
[2:50:16] <%TimetodiveLTX> tiddy immunity
[2:50:16] <Ipsenscastle> this is true, at least during the act of painting
[2:50:17] <%ShichiNoBushi> Plague must be blind to tits by now.
[2:50:17] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Yes
[2:50:18] <%GabeSweetMan> I've drawn so many tits.
[2:50:19] <+fingalights> Before it doesn't get you hard anymore
[2:50:19] <%pectusumbra> Yusuke is literally a student though
[2:50:19] <TDAWS_MP132> pretty much every villain after this is an antagonist kinda, up until haru
[2:50:20] <%Totally_not_toby> no they see it every time and they have demons about it
[2:50:21] <%j0ustar> Unfortunately, Pat's right.
[2:50:21] <%kewlmyc> doctors too
[2:50:21] <marvinbrewton25> the sag is real
[2:50:21] <%RubberFistFight> GET NAKED FOR ART, ANN
[2:50:22] <%SvenHolgersson> I DONT WANNA SEE YOUR TITTIES I JUST WANNA PAINT
[2:50:24] <Sgt_Wigglytuff> Yusuke is an absolute lad
[2:50:24] <%RubberFistFight> JUST DO IT
[2:50:24] <%TimetodiveLTX> like taking small doses of poison
[2:50:25] <BluBox> The titty only brings pain and tears
[2:50:25] <OldManDeckardCain> YEAH ESPECIALLY THE SEX DEVIANTS
[2:50:27] <+Remery_> Is it the same for penis?
[2:50:28] <%MisterRockett> I took life drawing classes and yeah pretty much a naked body is a naked body.
[2:50:28] <%worldbrand> It's true, old people buttholes drove me blind
[2:50:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...
[2:50:31] <%Persona_EX> he's still fucking weird.
[2:50:32] <%goose_attack_almanac> I counteract this by turning the model into a hydra of penises
[2:50:33] <%GabeSweetMan> Life Drawing courses RUINS the beauty of the human form.
[2:50:33] <%tweedler92> Yeah it's true
[2:50:33] <%Run44forrest> why did they double down on the weird sex shit
[2:50:34] <+neon_island> isnt Ann like 17?
[2:50:35] <whitemage4life> You must find the titty beneath the titty
[2:50:36] <heartlesshealer> it's more like "oh fuck, I have to try to get -that- color now"
[2:50:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its less you don't see it but rather you see its shape and form and now what it it actually is?
[2:50:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> welp LUL
[2:50:38] <SweetCuppingCake> Yeah, under a school/professional setting, the tiddy disappears
[2:50:39] <%Valdorick> and assholes
[2:50:39] <vonmaultke> Its not that, you focus on the form and detail more then the idea of Titty
[2:50:39] <%Ancopro> but i still wouldnt ask a classmate thio
[2:50:39] <%optimasmaximas> @neon_island yes
[2:50:41] <%Nikopol1717> Life drawing ain't sexy, it's concentrating on making it not look like ass
[2:50:41] <%MonsterEnvy> Yusuke is the same age
[2:50:42] <%LaughingCatt> also yes
[2:50:44] <%ToxInjection> You're probably just drawing lines at that point
[2:50:45] <Mattais88> This does not stand for the crossroads of life, It's just a butthole
[2:50:50] <+Neoripo> Go to a nude beach for a few weeks and the same happens
[2:50:50] <%Run44forrest> aww

[2:51:50] <%starotter70> Little different
[2:51:51] <%Th3SmartAlec> Are we gonna ignore the context of Ann's friend's suicide attempt after being sexuall assaulted as blackmail?
[2:51:51] <heartlesshealer> Saying this to the SEXUAL ABUSE VICTIM
[2:51:54] <Mattais88> Madarame has driven people to suicide.

[2:52:07] <%BoomerUnchained> Indeed
[2:52:08] <+DarkNerdShawny> Yusuke is no different from Komeshida actually..................

[2:52:16] <+ScrapSentinel> @optimasmaximas its on BTTV, but you'd have to have BTTVPro so you can make it into a personal use emote

[2:52:23] <%TalisKanju> Japan though @PatStaresAt
[2:52:24] <%the1truefaraldo> Rape = plagiarism
[2:52:25] <%Czar_Kazem> HE ISNT

[2:52:27] <heartlesshealer> opening was too strong
[2:52:28] <%cvp5127> 3 is pretty bad
[2:52:29] <AEUG_Ace_Kamille> He did kill Yusuke's mother indirectly.
[2:52:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> @PatStaresAt BUT YUSUKE BEING A SEX IS PERVERT FINE
[2:52:32] <%MonsterEnvy> He isnt
[2:52:33] <+rei0> shido is pretty bad
[2:52:34] <%j0ustar> Kamoshida should be the LAST one.
[2:52:34] <%SvenHolgersson> The other ones are just for money LITERALLY
[2:52:34] <%starotter70> Bar is set TOO high
[2:52:35] <Monkeyweed21> Kamiya rapes off screen
[2:52:37] <Zayasu> kaneshiro is pretty bad but look at his face LUL

[2:52:40] <%Czar_Kazem> THERES A MOB BOSS
[2:52:40] <%BigCoffee> @PatStaresAt Ok but in the game he did push his previous students to suicide. It's not rape but I mean he literally killed people.
[2:52:41] <+Ramsus88> eh, the others affect more ppl and arguably are worse
[2:52:42] <%Madbearv> he should have been in the middle
[2:52:42] <$thesickestzak> nliL1 nliL2 nliL3
[2:52:42] <Fear_Ranjer> Last guy's at least on pat
[2:52:43] <+GingerStrawhat> Well the third and the Last guy
[2:52:44] <supertrigun> He also makes it really personal
[2:52:44] <%LaughingCatt> Last guy is pretty evil
[2:52:45] <Fear_Ranjer> *par
[2:52:45] <%arancet> kamoshida ISNT the worst, hes just presented with the biggest emotional impact
[2:52:47] <Damie904> It's seven deadly sins. It's just unfortunate LUST is first.
[2:52:48] <bxdragon> Okumura was gonna sell his kid so kinda but still Kamoshida is still the worst.
[2:52:50] <+Ramsus88> kamoshida is just personal
[2:52:51] <OBS_VinnieK> The third was pretty bad also
[2:52:52] <%optimasmaximas> @ScrapSentinel f, dont have pro FeelsBadMan
[2:52:54] <%SGrim> @PatStaresAt Kanashiro does do the whole forced schoolgirl prostitution thing.
[2:52:54] <%SvenHolgersson> Kamoshida lioterally had a girl try to kill herself because he felt her up
[2:52:56] <%NopeBadguy> The burger king CEO is as bad as the rapist and the murderer Kappa
[2:52:57] <%Quigsies> You only realize kaneshiro is bad if you get a game over

[2:52:57] <heartlesshealer> and then Futaba's social link friend....
[2:52:58] <dohrge> futaba is evil Kappa
[2:52:58] <%MonsterEnvy> Kamoshida is not as bad but he is just really hatable
[2:52:58] <%SvenHolgersson> HE IS THE WORSTTTTTTTTTT
[2:53:00] <YakumoYomi> I think it's implied that Shido is also into rape/sexual harrassment
[2:53:00] <%GabeSweetMan> But driving someone to suicide is FUCKING UP THERE
[2:53:00] <+GingerStrawhat> Yeah and Okumura isn't great
[2:53:02] <%Legato_Ambrose> They're all "just as bad" really
[2:53:02] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt Kaneshiro sells underaged girls into sex slavery

[2:53:17] <+lucaflowe> Okumaro
[2:53:18] <%starotter70> Yea, okumura
[2:53:20] <%MonsterEnvy> Madarame has driven multiple people to suicide
[2:53:21] <%optimasmaximas> okumura yeah
[2:53:21] <heartlesshealer> yeah, Okumura
[2:53:22] <purple_bagel> Third guy’s pretty fucked up, but the game paints him as a haha funnyman
[2:53:23] <+GingerStrawhat> He's still pretty bad because he let Yusukes mom die
[2:53:23] <Monkeyweed21> okumura is JUST a japanese CEO
[2:53:27] <%weissguard> Marry your daughter for POLITICS!
[2:53:28] <BlueLunecy> Okumura had the fiance business
[2:53:29] <%optimasmaximas> ryuji LLU
[2:53:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> RYUJI WHAT THE FUCK MAN
[2:53:29] <%CursedNobleman> kinky
[2:53:32] <%valriot> The new dungeon is best dungeon
[2:53:32] <+lucaflowe> Okumura is odd too
[2:53:32] <%MonsterEnvy> Okumura is pretty shitty guy
[2:53:32] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ARE YOU NOT CONFIDENT
[2:53:33] <%genowyn> Okumura is hiring people to kill people
[2:53:33] <OldManDeckardCain> OKUMURA DOES CHINA SLAVERY LUL
[2:53:34] <firewhiskeys> Madarame is regularly emotionally abusing children.
[2:53:34] <%SvenHolgersson> Yusuke's mom was sick tho he just lied to her right?
[2:53:34] <KamikazeKangaro> hamburger jeff bezos
[2:53:34] <%Totally_not_toby> yeah but kaneshiro isn't as personal and his operation isn't held up by parents of the people involved
[2:53:34] <%rytyoung> oh hey I know this place
[2:53:35] <3Xgilly> SICK
[2:53:36] <Jetsfantasy> FBI OPEN UP
[2:53:37] <%logoth_> Okumura did participate in the troubles
[2:53:37] <%VashyronM> Classy Ryuji
[2:53:38] <%psydaku> m
[2:53:38] <+palebluedots> gross
[2:53:39] <%arancet> okumura is meant to be a little less bad, for story reasons
[2:53:39] <+evbites> it should
[2:53:40] <YakumoYomi> Okumura is basically just a callous CEO
[2:53:42] <%ChaosAethr> One of them didnt comit anything Wrong
[2:53:42] <%Spec7re> Still a minor!
[2:53:44] <+knowyourenemy_97> meh
[2:53:45] <%SGrim> Okumura should have been earlier. Also that would have given Haru SOMETHING early.
[2:53:45] <+abrupt_abe> You can be guaranteed Madarame sexually harassed his pupils too
[2:53:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @damie904 Interestingly enough lust is considered the least grave of the 7 Deadly Sins
[2:53:48] <Ipsenscastle> big ol' vag close-up
[2:53:48] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Plagerist is as bad as the rape man damn never thought I'd laugh that hard at hearing that
[2:53:49] <theangryguyofde> So...Madarame should fit in by...pushing...Yusuke...to schoolgirl prostitute?
[2:53:50] <%thenumber5point5> Cutting in to Anns onlyfans money
[2:53:52] <Fear_Ranjer> I'm sorry wasn't Ann sexually abused????
[2:53:53] <+GingerStrawhat> Madarame is still pretty bad though
[2:53:54] <mastertwin2> I mean Okumura was also just gonna legit sell Haru off
[2:53:55] <%TalisKanju> That's the problem on it's head. Kamoshida is VERY PERSONAL, and the other ones are even less so
[2:53:56] <%SvenHolgersson> Okumura is butt
[2:53:58] <zenorot> Get Naked for the Creepy Artist, Ann
[2:53:59] <%GabeSweetMan> And with Sae, well that's every prosecutor everywhere. Her Casino should have like 90 other Casinos stacked on top of it.
[2:54:00] <%Meltdown547> I was certain Okumura was a sting operation by the police with how minor his crimes were comparatively.
[2:54:01] <%SvenHolgersson> Haru is good tho
[2:54:05] <%rytyoung> BUT still kinda bad
[2:54:10] <%mechslayer71> MAKOTO Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm

[2:55:02] <%Maids4lyfe> HEY oh
[2:55:04] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt Fun fact, to get Haru's best weapon, you need to max out Ohyas social link to itemise the persona, meaning Haru is even more worthless
[2:55:05] <%Spec7re> Wait what
[2:55:06] <Damie904> Her S-link? Trash Her personality? Trash Her Bonuses? Trash

[2:55:14] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt Sae as well, she doesn't seem to be bad at ALL, she's just disillusioned - which isn't at all rare for people doing her job. It's BAD, but it's not teenager-sex-slavery-rape-murder bad.

[2:55:46] <%RubberFistFight> THAT SOUNDS GOOD SMELLS
[2:55:46] <%bread_assassin> The best part of hanging with her is that it boosts your charm, as well.
[2:55:49] <@SoFarFetched> @fenrirmitsuki It's Tiffany Grant who Voices Asuka in Eva

[2:56:14] <%Andrizzleton> Oh boy Mishima how shitty
[2:56:15] <%Th3SmartAlec> NO
[2:56:18] <nopgnikatnight> Mishima looks like a simp
[2:56:20] <%TalisKanju> Ohya can't stack up to Kawakami. Also, Takemi, I guess.
[2:56:21] <+yoshkosh20> this sound like a set up for a murder
[2:56:27] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Y'know hearing smells is a sign of traumatic brain damage
[2:56:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> THIS IS A FUCKING SET UP
[2:56:30] <%floralkami> @patstaresat the problem with this is that they started with a situation anyone with a decent moral compass can understand and get behind hating, but afterwards making the situations (like stealing artists' life works) more nuanced and asking the player to "think" a bit more about the underlying personality traits that make the villian a shitty person.
[2:56:31] <TheSaltminer> Amanda Winn Lee was Rei's voice actor, not Asuka's
[2:56:34] <%honeyman18> Did Bish
[2:56:35] <%valriot> I bet Mishima has a twitter about fate
[2:56:36] <+GingerStrawhat> Mishima is alright, he be big simping but he's okay
[2:56:38] <%Shwepie> Does it count as a change of heart if you literally steal their heart's desires?
[2:56:41] <%mechslayer71> They talk on the phone now?
[2:56:41] <%Run44forrest> mishima why are you fucking telling
[2:56:43] <%Klefth> NakanoHAra, goddammit....
[2:56:45] <%SvenHolgersson> Mishima has the most hilarious story quest line
[2:56:45] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt make sure you work at the strength confidant (the twins) quickly. They've adjusted the rewards a bit and trust me, you will super appreciate it when you get it.
[2:56:46] <%Run44forrest> HEARING SMELLS?
[2:56:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> wow

[2:58:05] <%Th3SmartAlec> Casino Owner breifly considered being an asshole = EVIL PALACE
[2:58:07] <digitalbooklet> madarame seems legit like a plagarist groomer
[2:58:08] <%BigCoffee> he let Yusuke's mom die to steal her painting
[2:58:09] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Madarame is a Leech
[2:58:11] <%around_40_jobbers> smart pat
[2:58:11] <heartlesshealer> Kamoshida also drove girl to attempt suicide
[2:58:12] <%Pyroclase> Emotional abuse is TERRIBLE
[2:58:14] <+SpectrumSpy> Don't forget about chewing up orphans and dumping them on the street
[2:58:20] <%Maids4lyfe> Kamashida's victim tried to KILL HERSELF TOO
[2:58:23] <%Pyroclase> I know people who striaght up have PTSD from this kinda shit
[2:58:23] <%SaiyanShoto> But Kamoshida was more personal

[2:59:17] <bxdragon> My virgin ears can't take this horrible language.
[2:59:17] <@SoFarFetched> name calling is terms of endearment in the Boivin household.
[2:59:22] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt Quick tip, when you get itemise persona function, turn Arsene into a good early game weapon
[2:59:28] <%Th3SmartAlec> How's it feel Paige? To be a biiiittttch?
[2:59:34] <heartlesshealer> You call her Peaches

[3:00:26] <marvinbrewton25> whooHA is what its called
[3:00:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> that is a vagoo pat
[3:00:27] <heartlesshealer> it's called a "vagina" dear
[3:00:29] <%RubberFistFight> @AEUG_Ace_Kamille well for starters, in Japan, that's viewed quite a bit differently than it is in Western nations. This, being a Japanese game, is going to display it thusly.
[3:00:30] <Ipsenscastle> back in the day we called it a cunt

[3:01:41] <%valriot> WHAT THE FUCK IVE NEVER USED THAT TOILET
[3:01:41] <purple_bagel> I think the main problem with p5’s villains is that, as they go on, the main cast gets more and more detached from them. Kamoshida threatened to expel the gang, broke ryuji’s leg, and sexually abused ann and her friend. Okumura? Forcing a girl you barely know to marry a creep.

[3:31:30] <%weissguard> I'm just after Hawaii. @Joestar1890 So far, Akechi is actually pleasant.
[3:31:32] <%floralkami> cheer500 The problem with the villains imo is the writers started off with a situation anyone with a decent moral compass can agree on hating. After that, the situations get more nuanced (plagairizing artists' lifeworks and effectively stealing the ownership of their style), asking the player to actively emphasize with the victims. Like, to me as an artist this would be my personal hell, but that alone wouldn't hit as hard to most.

[3:57:30] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt Thanks to the LUT they apply to the webcam firmware, jacking up the saturation without applying additional fixes causes everything in the red channel to blow the fuck out. Meaning any tiny blotches or areas of your face that are even SLIGHTLY pink, like a pimple or a scratch, suddenly show up as giant red blotches.

[4:02:46] <%chill_o_wisp> yeah turn down sharpness
[4:02:46] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt Full/Partial are the black/white point settings. "Full" = black at 0, white at 255. "Partial" = black at 16, white at 235. If the settings in every source and output don't match, you get weird results like what you just saw with it washing out.
[4:02:47] <Meekest> When you move its super weird
[4:02:48] <pokketlint60> It was as GRAINY AS YOUR BAGUETTE DICK

[4:04:47] <%optimasmaximas> surprising
[4:04:48] <+Aniki_Tony> how far are you pat
[4:04:49] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Cool
[4:04:49] <%Maids4lyfe> that's cool
[4:04:50] <Gameaholic42> If it's the fusion guide I'm thinking of, be sure to mess with the settings. DLC Personas screw it up.
[4:04:50] <%segonian> hey Pat. Is Persona 1 and 2 worth playing? put them on my modded PlayStation classic and was curious.
[4:04:50] <blue2red> HotPokket fun
[4:04:52] <+JumboCrunchies> Pat just Bah duh duh dons sometimes
[4:04:52] <%코코꾸라> I cried from laughter with the camera thing, thanks for that
[4:04:53] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt actually with that guide it'll take you 10 minutes tops
[4:04:54] <%floralkami> we're all watching a man slowly lose his marbles playing jacks in the ocean @patstaresat
[4:04:54] <%conradical> you need to be a fairly high level to do it anyway
[4:04:56] <+Kingjhon8> but we'll miss the interactions
[4:04:56] <%FatherGreyBeard> fair enough
[4:05:00] <%Daniel_Is_I> I hate the fusion confidants
[4:05:04] <zenorot> not really its just fusing personas
[4:05:05] <%mechslayer71> @13ry4n93 new content spread throughout the game,
[4:05:06] <pokketlint60> Persoonas
[4:05:06] <%alcors_wisdom> you should really get ryuji up to 7 as quickly as possible its very important
[4:05:11] <lozard> Black Pat dlc
[4:05:21] <%cvp5127> are there new scenes for strength ?
[4:05:22] <%Dr00_PhD> @13ry4n93 lots of QOL stuff and more content toward the back half
[4:05:23] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @segonian I think P2 is actually the best in the series, for what it's worth
[4:05:24] <+JumboCrunchies> Wait WTF is Thieve's Den
[4:05:25] <pokketlint60> "Persunas"
[4:05:27] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt it's the one I used, it's perfectly fine to get you to at LEAST Rank 5.
[4:05:30] <firewhiskeys> I don't have DLC and the fusion guide has only failed me once.
[4:05:31] <zenorot> wait why?
[4:05:32] <+JumboCrunchies> Golden thing?
[4:05:49] <pokketlint60> "Why are there asterisks next to this SHIET" Pat is turning back into Black Pat
[4:05:49] <Gameaholic42> Yeah I use a different one, you might be fine
[4:05:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> (for real?)
[4:05:53] <%alcors_wisdom> are you using the persona 5 guide or the person 5 royal guide
[4:05:55] <+JumboCrunchies> Royal, not Golden. Fuck.
[4:05:58] <%segonian> cool thanks.
[4:06:12] <%BoomerUnchained> #Bringbackshadowpat

[4:06:31] <%DrFacilier> @junks2300 its basically a gallery for stuff like music and whatnot
[4:06:33] <pokketlint60> Awwwww.
[4:06:36] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt I believe the asterisks are the ones that were changed for P5R. The early ones used to be a bit different iirc.
[4:06:37] <%Like51bears> SPLOOSH
[4:06:39] <+NitronStreams> gross

[4:07:38] <%starotter70> Bust a nut
[4:07:41] <%RubberFistFight> @damascussteele that was a whole lot of farting and hot air, there was basically no way for them to actually enforce their threats. That's why so many people streamed/LPd it without hassle.
[4:07:43] <Worldeatergrizzly> the dung eon
[4:07:46] <pokketlint60> I'm gonna bust loose ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[4:07:50] <Aydarkzero> grind time

[4:08:19] <+Jaromero435> It's probably already been discussed, but what was your main team originally? Are you going to change it up?
[4:08:20] <%kyh9> The best kind
[4:08:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> This is reverse White Van
[4:08:26] <wes_ranked> CHILD DEMANDS SNACK
[4:08:26] <damascussteele> @rubberfistfight well hopefully theyll not care anymore
[4:08:29] <+zevjayx> Thanks yall
[4:08:38] <%RubberFistFight> @damascussteele they care, they just can't actually DO anything.

[4:08:47] <%starotter70> Yeah
[4:08:48] <%Daniel_Is_I> PASSIVES
[4:08:48] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt yeah it's basically Pokemon now lol.
[4:08:49] <+Kingjhon8> oh shit, pomemon abilites
[4:08:49] <DrStinkers> Pokemon abilities?
[4:08:50] <OldManDeckardCain> pat finally got to this shiet LUL
[4:08:50] <%s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt Persona is pokemon now.
[4:08:51] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Neat
[4:08:53] <%ExpressNode> I wonder if they will add all this in SMT V
[4:08:54] <+PatMorgana> PASSIVES LETS GOOOO
[4:08:55] <%conradical> Traits are real good
[4:08:56] <NeroInfinite> yep
[4:08:57] <%hawk_rush> traits are super cool
[4:09:02] <%GabeSweetMan> Is this like Pokemon "Personalities"?
[4:09:05] <%alcors_wisdom> remember to keep your detection in the 40~ range to get more treasure shadows to show up
[4:09:06] <NeroInfinite> Some arebetter than others
[4:09:07] <%Th3SmartAlec> ooohhh
[4:09:08] <pokketlint60> @s_xylocalsingles Implying Persona wasn't always Pokemon
[4:09:08] <Fear_Ranjer> YEEEES MORE VARIETY
[4:09:10] <%optimasmaximas> PogChamp
[4:09:12] <%weissguard> They're REALLY NICE.
[4:09:15] <zenorot> so basically what they did in SMT4A
[4:09:16] <WanderingSwordsman> check your parties traits
[4:09:16] <+PatMorgana> your teammates have them too
[4:09:17] <shiny_prinny> gives me Devil Survivor vibes
[4:09:18] <%arancet> @PatStaresAt your party members also got em
[4:09:20] <+Jaromero435> You can pass them down like skills too
[4:09:21] <%Persona_EX> so they're STRAIGHT UP pokemans now
[4:09:22] <%weissguard> EVEN BETTER.
[4:09:23] <%Run44forrest> DAS PRETTY GOOD
[4:09:24] <OldManDeckardCain> even your team mates
[4:09:24] <%RubberFistFight> Some of them are so fucking broken with the right moveset
[4:09:24] <%Totally_not_toby> @PatStaresAt yeah they basically did this so high level moves don't just drain your whole SP with one move
[4:09:25] <Damie904> CHECK THE PARTY'S TRAITS
[4:09:26] <%conradical> check out the higher level ones
[4:09:33] <TDAWS_MP132> party traits too?
[4:09:35] <Fear_Ranjer> I LOVE THESE YEEES
[4:09:43] <wes_ranked> makotos is very good
[4:09:51] <%weissguard> Using Ma-level spells was always a bother until NOW.
[4:09:56] <zenorot> Can party members even have teaits
[4:10:00] <%weissguard> Yes.
[4:10:00] <%tigerfang86> HUGE
[4:10:01] <Fear_Ranjer> BOBBY???
[4:10:03] <%tigerfang86> RYUJI IS HUGE
[4:10:03] <%DrFacilier> CHEATS
[4:10:07] <%optimasmaximas> PogChamp holy shit
[4:10:07] <%GabeSweetMan> YO
[4:10:09] <%starotter70> Yeah, they're really good
[4:10:12] <Fear_Ranjer> YO THESE TRAITS GREAT
[4:10:15] <+sixcubit> The IVs in this game are intolerable. I spent 12 hours just breeding a Ryuji with perfect stat spread.
[4:10:17] <%FatherGreyBeard> Good Shit
[4:10:19] <%GabeSweetMan> BLESS
[4:10:20] <%tigerfang86> EMLO IS FAST
[4:10:21] <%weissguard> Big DOPE. They trigger damn near constantly.
[4:10:23] <%BoomerUnchained> psaGib psaGib
[4:10:23] <%Spec7re> psaGib psaGib psaGib

[4:10:25] <%optimasmaximas> psaPorgmo
[4:10:25] <Thalchampz> HAIYAI
[4:10:25] <Fear_Ranjer> THAT'S ELMO'S MILK NOW
[4:10:25] <%nofestu2> BB demands water
[4:10:26] <%CappuccinoGuil> Oh shit, what's the cheat???
[4:10:26] <geosspone> boi he tried for it
[4:10:28] <%spiritofmojave> ELMO SPEED
[4:10:32] <geosspone> sandpa2Thermit
[4:10:32] <%tigerfang86> EMLO SPEED
[4:10:32] <%CappuccinoGuil> I missed it, what happened?

[4:10:41] <pokketlint60> Very fast Elmo moving at incredibly hihg speed
[4:10:46] <NeroInfinite> Elmo tried to drink the malk
[4:10:49] <Thalchampz> he wants MALK
[4:10:49] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Baby need his milk
[4:10:50] <%AzureGale> CAT
[4:10:56] <%miguelrod777> psaGib father I desire the milk
[4:11:03] <+NitronStreams> give it to emlo
[4:11:07] <+ahdurian> SHARE WITH THE BABY
[4:11:11] <Worldeatergrizzly> flash steps for milk
[4:11:11] <@SoFarFetched> It's a good Hot Mess
[4:11:11] <zenorot> All their skills are automatic right. Like you change weaker version of spells for stronger ones. Its not like you can rapidly change party members moves
[4:11:12] <OldManDeckardCain> izanagi on okami the dlc persona has the most broken trait that gives you attack and defense boost based on your persona compendium % LUL
[4:11:12] <NeroInfinite> Elmo is lactose intoleran
[4:11:15] <%Persona_EX> ive never just drank a straight up glass of milk i don't get it
[4:11:17] <%conradical> !uptime
[4:11:17] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 11m.
[4:11:19] <%weissguard> It's been a fun mess, so it's pretty sweet.
[4:11:21] <Zombrocom> It always is
[4:11:24] <Fear_Ranjer> It wouldn't be a PatStaresAt stream without mess
[4:11:27] <pokketlint60> "This stream's been a fuckin' mess" Don't bullshit @PatStaresAt every stream is a fuckin' mess that's why we love you
[4:11:30] <%conradical> 4 hours and maybe only 30ish minutes of P5R
[4:11:30] <illTemperedSeaBass> I thought the appeal was that all of your streams are messes.
[4:11:32] <DannyBlaxonOG> Oh Madarame?
[4:11:36] <%Persona_EX> that shit tastes so disgusting
[4:11:37] <%alcors_wisdom> psaBlind
[4:11:39] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[4:11:43] <+sixcubit> Welcome to the final dungeon in the game with a fun layout!
[4:11:52] <DannyBlaxonOG> I am new so what's with the skeleton?
[4:11:56] <%hawk_rush> palace #4 says hi
[4:11:59] <zenorot> Sae's palace
[4:12:02] <pokketlint60> Ruse Cruise is fun though
[4:12:06] <%starotter70> I liked the pyramid
[4:12:11] <Warbot40> Palace 4 and 6 are good
[4:12:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[4:12:13] <%nilla_24> okumura's palace is so bad
[4:12:16] <+Aniki_Tony> The entire story
[4:12:16] <%tigerfang86> he cleans the house, poorly
[4:12:17] <%nofestu2> Paiges sex toy
[4:12:17] <Thalchampz> he's a good lad
[4:12:18] <%optimasmaximas> i think they're referring to the new palace in royal?
[4:12:19] <+Kamennoo> @DannyBlaxonOG skeleton
[4:12:19] <+Aniki_Tony> one line
[4:12:20] <TDAWS_MP132> LUL
[4:12:20] <wes_ranked> without spoiling can anyone tell me if the two "very special challenge battles" are dlc only or can unlocked through normal play?
[4:12:21] <DannyBlaxonOG> OK
[4:12:22] <%hawk_rush> palace 4 is teh best (also has the best music)
[4:12:23] <pokketlint60> @DannyBlaxonOG His hat says "Get Smoked" in case you were wondering.
[4:12:23] <Warbot40> I think 3 is fine
[4:12:23] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Do you not have a house skeleton friend?
[4:12:25] <%ExpressNode> I don't remember this dungeon much like the others
[4:12:26] <+NitronStreams> psaSkelmoney
[4:12:27] <%Spec7re> Paige is sexually attracted to skellmo
[4:12:29] <%damienlunas> Skelmo is a pure boy and is not for lewd
[4:12:29] <%Farples> psaSkelmoney psaSkelmoney psaSkelmoney
[4:12:30] <%alcors_wisdom> naw the 4th dungeon has a fun layout
[4:12:32] <%conradical> everything about the Okumuras suck. Haru is such a nothing
[4:12:35] <crovvv> I like most of the Palace's but the bank fucking sucks
[4:12:36] <Worldeatergrizzly> they let himm out of the closet it never went back
[4:12:37] <%PrimordialDonut> okumura's palace isn't as bad as i was told, kaneshiros was god awful
[4:12:38] <%RubberFistFight> LAZOR
[4:12:39] <%Darkfire346> wait, no ff7?
[4:12:39] <%maenos2> @valentinius_anodyne nah I got house masks.
[4:12:42] <NeroInfinite> I think they can be unlocked naturally
[4:12:43] <zenorot> Pyramid had too many instant deaths and that long hallway
[4:12:45] <+Aniki_Tony> Hey Pat, I think one painting looks like Adachi
[4:12:47] <MasterDecoder> @Spec7re Nah, they're CoWorkers
[4:12:47] <%floralkami> Skellmo is their marital aid
[4:12:49] <NeroInfinite> FF7 is tomarrow
[4:12:50] <%tigerfang86> your HUGE SKILLS
[4:12:55] <%j0ustar> Feed skelmo some money he looks bone dry!
[4:13:01] <%alcors_wisdom> @conradical ill have to stop you right there because haru is the best choice in the phantom theives
[4:13:03] <Warbot40> It's okumura, shido, and mementos that are not great.
[4:13:06] <%AzureGale> lazors
[4:13:06] <%hawk_rush> it's pretty easy to bypass the instant deaths
[4:13:10] <%Darkfire346> awww man. i wanted to see Jessie finally get smashed like she wanted
[4:13:14] <+NitronStreams> COMBAT
[4:13:14] <%hawk_rush> I think palace #4 is the easiest

[4:15:14] <%tigerfang86> wait, plague HATES something????
[4:15:18] <%TimetodiveLTX> genuinely doesn't seem like he's enjoying himself

[4:15:33] <+Kamennoo> @ape_hawk sorry to disapoint he is not LUL
[4:15:34] <@SoFarFetched> I assume he's near the end of it.
[4:15:35] <%DrFacilier> pretty sure each of his streams were like 13 hours each
[4:15:38] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[4:15:45] <+Kamennoo> hes eli
[4:15:45] <%Daxalog> Hes having trouble with using his ATB gauge and getting knocked down
[4:15:49] <%weissguard> @Worldeatergrizzly Fair warning. Other than the stuff new to Royal, Base Persona 5 spoilers seems to be fair game.
[4:15:50] <%maenos2> jesus that long
[4:15:51] <%LordSDB> @PatStaresAt He's done like, 3-4 8 hours streams of the game. Also he loves Barret
[4:15:54] <%ape_hawk> what is plague hating on specifically now?
[4:15:56] <%LandOfTheWay> oldmanyellsatcloud.jpeg
[4:15:58] <%ammobasket> as much as he hates the Romans
[4:16:01] <$Dakuu75> I only watched a little bit of Plague playing FF7R... he legit seemed to be salty. But, that was during the Aerith phase
[4:16:02] <KaitlynnHere> What does he like?
[4:16:02] <+teg88> I'd be more surprised if he liked it/could play it
[4:16:04] <TheWe4pon> to be fair stuns are not fun
[4:16:04] <%RubberFistFight> YEAAAAAH i just repaired the laptop and the Tanaka jingle played!! It's just like P4G LUL
[4:16:05] <%ape_hawk> oh, that he sucks at the combat in ff7?

[4:17:55] <+DZiffer> @Dakuu75 Yea, seems like it ^^'
[4:17:57] <%mechslayer71> Just finished FF7 remake today. As someone who never played he original, I was OKAY with the ending, but I can see how someone who played the original and wanted a faithful remake would be FUCKING PISSED
[4:17:58] <%FatherGreyBeard> Ah. Must not have noticed
[4:18:01] <pokketlint60> Ryuji twerkin' on MC's dick
[4:18:04] <%AzureGale> Dicksona, come forth!
[4:18:04] <%damienlunas> Sometimes Plague is really insightful, but in things like his FFXIV streams, he kept skipping dialogue or ignoring it then complaining that the game doesn't explain shit it just explained.
[4:18:04] <illTemperedSeaBass> ... I've grown convinced Plague isn't a human being. He is something earlier on the evolutionary path to humanity.
[4:18:05] <Chester_goes_Berserk> he loves the character monents, but nooot a fan of the combat and some additions
[4:18:13] <$Dakuu75> where's the Hell-House Persona???
[4:18:15] <%Alopekis> He has something
[4:18:29] <%Dementedpenguin> @Dayube just certain story elements and padding. Don't want to go in detail for obvious reasons
[4:18:30] <NeroInfinite> It's in the pyramid
[4:18:34] <TheWe4pon> Pat is a baker cause he puts the buns in the oven.
[4:18:39] <+Dayube> fair enough
[4:18:57] <+Story_Ark> oh yeah, plague is great for stuff that sucks but because he hates everything, when its something actually good its frustrating.

[4:19:09] <mattynezz> Assuming he doesn't like THOSE additions, he's not wrong. The combat is pretty damn thin, and those additions feel like KH nonsense and kind of ruin the pacing and themes of FF7

I do the same thing with a lot of shit I like. Just because you can see the ways it can be BETTER, doesn't mean you don't appreciate it for what it IS.

[4:25:53] <pokketlint60> FF7R just feels like the game FFXV wanted to be. Modern fantasy setting with combat that is action based but centered around giving commands and exploiting weaknesses like an RPG, Huge explorable environments. The difference is FFXV is a bland empty open world with inconsistent and nonsensical world building while 7R actually tries to make it's world make sense and limits the size of the maps to areas that are actually interesting to visit.

[4:31:14] <+Bl3ssthefall3x> Are nuke abilities new to persona 5 royal
[4:31:15] <ultimate_joker_main> immunity to physical but also gun bless and curse
[4:31:16] <+Taglog7> I'd rather me immune to mental BibleThump
[4:31:16] <vobent> rather be immune to emotional
[4:31:17] <Synti_Sin> it's kinda lame how early you can get shiki-ouji, his nulls are op

[4:31:40] <%GohanHitsugaya> But if I was immune to physical, then I'd be immune to sex. I don't want that!
[4:31:43] <%s1rcuit> @Bl3ssthefall3x no, it's been in and out for several Persona games, but was part of P5 OG
[4:31:52] <%RubberFistFight> @midgarmerc there's an entire extra semester, extra boss, and extra palace, as well as a bunch of new characters and gameplay refinements. I would absolutely recommend it to someone who played the original a bunch.
[4:31:59] <ultimate_joker_main> @GohanHitsugaya just use drain physical instead :)
[4:32:04] <%RubberFistFight> it's basically what P4G was for P4

[4:33:03] <+Bl3ssthefall3x> Ah thanks for the info
[4:33:06] <%Dr00_PhD> @Bl3ssthefall3x a little but not as much as youd hope
[4:33:09] <%s1rcuit> @Bl3ssthefall3x not super sure because I don't have it, but since they added the grappling hook I'm going to say yes
[4:33:09] <wes_ranked> DONT FORGET TO LOOK FOR SEEDS MR PAT

[4:33:29] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> boxes
[4:33:30] <%RubberFistFight> @Bl3ssthefall3x very little, actually. They tweaked the layouts a tiny bit for the Will Seeds but the bulk of it, like 99%, remains the same.

[4:40:32] <%ExpressNode> I haven't booted the game in a while but does this game still have that "not in party and no exp" bullshit?
[4:40:33] <%AzureGale> Just get them all to max level, then they'll all be balanced :x
[4:40:34] <%Japanfreak2595> Broke: Sae is the best objectively, but it ultimately comes down preference./Woke: Ryuji is Best Gurl
[4:40:41] <Thalchampz> the exp goblin i understand, i like having all the party at the same level
[4:40:44] <%hawk_rush> @ExpressNode nah, they get a little exp
[4:40:44] <%Alopekis> 07734
[4:40:50] <%Alopekis> 43770
[4:40:50] <LazyLudens> It's been a while since I played P5, why is having everyone with balanced exp so crucial?
[4:40:51] <%Ultimatefool> 80085
[4:40:51] <%reonome> its not even his confidant it happens the moment he joins
[4:40:54] <aylixion> the legacy DLC has exp up items that help get people caught up though
[4:41:00] <Gameaholic42> Think about it like this. When you grind hard enough to make everybody hit LV 99 the XP will be equal again!
[4:41:03] <+StrifeZubia> @Japanfreak2595 Dancing Star Night confirmed Joker is in fact best girl
[4:41:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> I like having everyone at the same level, but same exact XP is ludicrous
[4:41:04] <%reonome> @LazyLudens goblins
[4:41:05] <%Daxalog> Dont call him that
[4:41:08] <%ShichiNoBushi> Moaner
[4:41:08] <%Daxalog> Please
[4:41:12] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> good
[4:41:16] <+InEzrealwetrust> man fuck ryuji
[4:41:18] <LazyLudens> @reonome oh LUL
[4:41:25] <%cvp5127> its the only solution
[4:41:25] <%AzureGale> Saved Moaner
[4:41:26] <%floralkami> mona, at least take the fucking vase before you jump down, wtf
[4:41:27] <ultimate_joker_main> @reonome no there is a fight wil only joker and yusuke in the party as part of his confidant
[4:41:29] <%ExpressNode> Mona is just a reverse colored Elmo
[4:41:31] <zenorot> Ryuji caused a stupid fight with morgana later. He's far from best girl material
[4:41:31] <%Totally_not_toby> no, fuck morgana
[4:41:32] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ryuji is the best
[4:41:39] <%Fooguwu> hope he never does that with a character named Nigel
[4:41:41] <%weissguard> These are better now too.
[4:41:42] <%spiritofmojave> Ryuji is amazing
[4:41:43] <%Totally_not_toby> ryuji owns morgana goes to the shelter
[4:41:45] <TioXyco> GEMSONA!
[4:41:45] <%Daniel_Is_I> Oh hey it's the "fusion isn't a ballache" personas!
[4:41:47] <%ape_hawk> oh no, its mr burns!
[4:41:47] <%spiritofmojave> Mona is a simp idiot
[4:41:48] <%Dr00_PhD> so much better now
[4:41:52] <%Dr00_PhD> nuke
[4:41:52] <%hawk_rush> ryuji is a good friend but a huge dumbass
[4:41:52] <%GarbageNirvana> These are the metal slimes of this game right
[4:41:54] <RogueMinja> Getting to 99 is kinda trivial in this game.
[4:41:54] <%logoth_> use Morgan's crit punch
[4:41:55] <NekoZen> lucky punch
[4:41:55] <alphonseisbest> KILL
[4:41:55] <%ammobasket> dEamond
[4:41:57] <+RowenCleric> ryuji is best bro
[4:41:57] <%bread_assassin> Exploit their weakness.
[4:41:57] <+Kingjhon8> level up personas
[4:41:58] <ultimate_joker_main> find weakness
[4:41:58] <%hawk_rush> use nuke
[4:41:59] <%starotter70> Down them, recruit
[4:42:00] <CookieCutter007> SourPls
[4:42:02] <%claudesavegely> they're metal slimes yeah?
[4:42:02] <%sirisvirus> look up their weakness
[4:42:02] <TDAWS_MP132> they usually have only one weakness
[4:42:02] <%AzureGale> It's a treasure demon
[4:42:03] <%xcompleasedad> I think Physical?
[4:42:03] <TioXyco> find the weakness, get them for fusion material
[4:42:03] <%DrFacilier> nuke prob
[4:42:03] <%Totally_not_toby> it's weak to a secret just find it
[4:42:03] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt weak to psy and nuke iirc
[4:42:04] <%Ynkubus18> capture
[4:42:04] <theoverlordgopher> nuke hit, iirc
[4:42:05] <Charronia> A ghost naroScared
[4:42:05] <%baronblank> frei
[4:42:05] <Gameaholic42> Find a weakness, the negotiate
[4:42:05] <%reonome> @ultimate_joker_main yeah but when yusuke joins the game forces him in your party, thus the exp is imbalanced in the miniboss fight
[4:42:06] <%s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt upgrade mat for personas
[4:42:06] <%GabeSweetMan> Upped Crit attacks
[4:42:06] <+StrifeZubia> Get lucky
[4:42:07] <alphonseisbest> nope
[4:42:07] <%Dragovus> They are Golden hands
[4:42:07] <%weissguard> Find the weak spot, then keep em for Fusions.
[4:42:08] <%Daniel_Is_I> These are rare
[4:42:08] <redrins> befriend it
[4:42:08] <Damie904> knock it down then acquire
[4:42:09] <%miguelrod777> no
[4:42:10] <+ahdurian> no
[4:42:10] <%Japanfreak2595> Ryuji is a himbo
[4:42:11] <%baronblank> capture
[4:42:12] <alphonseisbest> NOPE
[4:42:12] <%arancet> technically not limited, only rare
[4:42:12] <$PaleBloodInk> No.
[4:42:12] <+Kingjhon8> rare in mementos
[4:42:12] <%hawk_rush> you can find them in mementos
[4:42:14] <%miguelrod777> just rare
[4:42:15] <%Kirby_Sauce> gun
[4:42:15] <theoverlordgopher> they're in mementos, so no
[4:42:15] <%Owkono> crit
[4:42:16] <TDAWS_MP132> not limited
[4:42:16] <%bread_assassin> Not limited but rare.
[4:42:16] <Gameaholic42> NO VERY infinite
[4:42:16] <%ExpressNode> Throw all your skills against it and hope you get lucky
[4:42:17] <%starotter70> Rare, useful for fusion
[4:42:17] <video_gamer95> PAT THE TWAT
[4:42:18] <StarkAvKnark> All over mementos
[4:42:18] <+ahdurian> rare but not limited
[4:42:18] <alphonseisbest> Kill it
[4:42:19] <%weissguard> They even register in the Compendium.
[4:42:21] <%arcielardor> they're like metal slimes
[4:42:22] <%SomeSageAdvice> arent these the ones you need to fuse to make super good fusions?
[4:42:23] <%Ultimatefool> No, they're just like gold hands
[4:42:23] <%Dr00_PhD> get one for the compendium then use em for money and xp
[4:42:24] <+Tredecian> rare and random
[4:42:25] <%logoth_> crit move with Morgana to knock it down
[4:42:28] <zenorot> hit the weakness
[4:42:28] <%conradical> you can alwasy get them from mementos
[4:42:29] <video_gamer95> Love u
[4:42:29] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt once you acquire one, you can summon as many of that one as you want.
[4:42:29] <%aishman> They are rare personas that give you a SHIT ton of money and EXP. They will also show up in Mementos once you unlock the deeper areas.
[4:42:32] <%s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt pretty sure you can re-summon them in the velvet room
[4:42:32] <%Alopekis> You're not likely to ever see it coming
[4:42:33] <+Flambage> @PatStaresAt Recruit one for fusions too
[4:42:33] <Synti_Sin> capture first, kill the rest
[4:42:34] <$spardanwarrior> Just rare, pop out of breakable shit
[4:42:35] <%SGrim> @PatStaresAt big money for kill. No limits. Good for leveling confidants.
[4:42:36] <%GabeSweetMan> NICE
[4:42:40] <%arancet> but also good for fusion, so grab 1
[4:42:41] <+ahdurian> kill = money. capture = extra bonus for persona fusion
[4:42:44] <%Daniel_Is_I> They're also just straight fusion upgrades
[4:42:46] <%GabeSweetMan> GET
[4:42:46] <%bigmacjack12> Cheer1000 i feel like I’m the only one who hates Morgana, especially the way he keeps talking down to ryuji for being dumb, and then goes and pulls dumber shit himself. When events happen later in the game and that kerfuffle happens, i legit didnt even want the cat back
[4:42:47] <+MrBaldachin> just INSERTS itself
[4:42:54] <%s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt kill them for big xp, keep them for upgrading personas
[4:42:59] <%shaidot> Frei is good
[4:43:06] <%GabeSweetMan> But yeah REGISTER THAT SHIT
[4:43:08] <Charronia> Joker is a diplomatic genius PogChamp
[4:43:10] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt you can now just murder any of that time you encounter from now on, since you can summon it infinitely. There's like... 5 different ones, i think
[4:43:13] <%aishman> When you use them to fuse, they will just straight up give you the next Persona of that arcana
[4:43:16] <ultimate_joker_main> @reonome yeah the best way to balance exp is getting mishima to rank 10 otherwise good luck
[4:43:17] <%ExpressNode> TREASURE GET
[4:43:18] <%za7az> Well that was easy lol
[4:43:18] <purple_bagel> I fused one with another persona and got the raddest support persona ever, tons of heals and status cures, i think it also had like tons of resistances too
[4:43:19] <%shaidot> mementos during blackout
[4:43:22] <%floralkami> @bigmacjack12 dude, have you seen chat anytime the fucking cat talks?
[4:43:23] <%Zulrez> @bigmacjack12 you're not alone in that, fucking hated morgana after the school trip
[4:43:28] <%Dr00_PhD> @bigmacjack12 you're definitely the only one
[4:43:42] <zenorot> really good for leveling up Persona stats
[4:43:43] <%claudesavegely> yo
[4:43:45] <%weissguard> Big good.
[4:43:48] <%supercasualboom> Don’t say Persona with hard R, Pat.
[4:43:49] <%GabeSweetMan> SHLORP them into your soul
[4:43:54] <RaulGBastos1991> man these menu animations arte Nuts

[4:44:10] <TioXyco> yes
[4:44:11] <%Kirby_Sauce> depends
[4:44:12] <Synti_Sin> you can do either
[4:44:12] <Thalchampz> bigg exp and next tier
[4:44:13] <%Alopekis> @soullesskin Nope
[4:44:13] <%MisterRockett> Max exp iirc
[4:44:14] <+DZiffer> Personers go up
[4:44:15] <%starotter70> Either
[4:44:15] <+ahdurian> big exp
[4:44:16] <TioXyco> @soullesskin no
[4:44:17] <%GarbageNirvana> Go find out why don't you
[4:44:20] <OldManDeckardCain> the ygive you more traits to choose from
[4:44:21] <%hawk_rush> did you guys see that bleach gacha game that straight up copied persona 4's art and style? LUL
[4:44:21] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt They give you the next Persona of that Arcana (depending on the level)
[4:44:21] <%Dr00_PhD> You get the next persona up the arcana list
[4:44:22] <trianglehat> Hi Pat
[4:44:23] <%Alopekis> He's Pat.
[4:44:24] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @Dakuu75 That was Empress. Emperor is Hol Horse's gun
[4:44:24] <+StrifeZubia> Tier up in fusion, big XP when you do the sacrifice option
[4:44:24] <DjFrostBite95> He's pat
[4:44:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat is pat desu
[4:44:25] <%bigmacjack12> I’m happy to know I’m not the only one who despises simpcat
[4:44:25] <+soullesskin> Thanks
[4:44:27] <heartlesshealer> what are we talking about? The gems personas?
[4:44:27] <%conradical> you get better personers using treasure demons
[4:44:28] <%dekkitout> Good evening, Pat
[4:44:31] <%Ultimatefool> Wait who's Pat again?
[4:44:31] <Mattais88> Whatever persona you fuse it with goes to the next tier
[4:44:31] <%GabeSweetMan> Hi Pat, Hi Cat
[4:44:32] <%ammobasket> psaDab
[4:44:32] <@SoFarFetched> More FF7R will be tomorrow.
[4:44:34] <%DrFacilier> @soullesskin he big beat it no death run in 5 hours flat
[4:44:35] <TioXyco> I answered "yes" to you
[4:44:37] <$Dakuu75> @Valentinius_Anodyne ah, gotchya.
[4:44:41] <%floralkami> i just wish chat has better roasts to say instead of speaking simp all the time
[4:44:43] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt they make super strong fusions and as you see, you get all elements to choose from. Different types make for different results.
[4:44:45] <+fizuth> fizuth subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[4:44:46] <%conradical> they also get you better rewards when you get the other types
[4:44:51] <%conradical> other types of executions
[4:44:51] <%SH1NK1R0> They give xp bonus for fusions and have strong skills that can be inherited
[4:44:54] <%Japanfreak2595> Morgana simps because he has self worth issues.
[4:44:55] <%floralkami> çspamming
[4:44:57] <Gameaholic42> Fuse with regular persona and you get a lot of moves. Use to strengthen a current persona and big XP boost
[4:45:08] <%shurtal> you should have a hotkey that just throws "I'm Pat" in fancy font whenever you want
[4:45:09] <%bigmacjack12> Well the cat should stop big simping then
[4:45:17] <+soullesskin> @drfacilier big man pat over here lol
[4:45:17] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> cause thots begone
[4:45:19] <+midgarmerc> What do you think this version of the Velvet Room smells like?
[4:45:26] <%Dragovus> LOCK THE GOOD ONE!
[4:45:32] <%maenos2> like depression
[4:45:37] <%fizuth> hey just because morgana isn't as good as elmo doesn't mean he's worthless
[4:45:40] <+soullesskin> Trash
[4:45:40] <%GarbageNirvana> Doesn't it cost a shit-ton tho
[4:45:43] <%ExpressNode> @midgarmerc Blue Rasberry?
[4:45:48] <%Japanfreak2595> It smells like piss but only in Joker’s cell
[4:45:52] <+soullesskin> Throw that fucker in the pit of nothing
[4:45:59] <zenorot> lolis and old man sweat
[4:46:05] <%fizuth> Someone has made the Elmorgana joke right
[4:46:11] <NeroInfinite> Ah the weird horse
[4:46:14] <Charronia> "You can't handle this" naroSmug
[4:46:15] <Thalchampz> IT'S R- i mean, Fun.... horse
[4:46:15] <%GabeSweetMan> @floralkami Don't worry it'll run it's course like every other meme.
[4:46:30] <+Tredecian> look at the skills
[4:46:36] <%Dr00_PhD> It also makes a kickass item later
[4:46:42] <+soullesskin> Gotta make your numbers go up
[4:46:42] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt you remember that thing at rank 10 strength where you could pay for the personas above your level? You get it at rank 5 now. It's super OP.
[4:46:59] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> again? LUL
[4:47:07] <%ammobasket> ilLuSiOn
[4:47:10] <Highwang> can you perfect stealth one of these missions?
[4:47:26] <%KaiserMario> Damn, is Pat tripping the alarms on purpose for laughs?
[4:47:28] <ultimate_joker_main> perfect stealth as in ?
[4:47:30] <+soullesskin> Oh no
[4:47:34] <%hawk_rush> pat's sp usage is triggering my mind goblins psaGoblin
[4:47:35] <%floralkami> @gabesweetman if only there was a way to kill it faster, but i don't see boomers taking ownership any time soon
[4:47:35] <%Totally_not_toby> you still have to fight the boss
[4:47:37] <%LordSDB> Loving the art stream pat! psaBougie
[4:47:40] <%Totally_not_toby> so no?
[4:47:40] <%FatherGreyBeard> Hoo

[4:47:56] <%Ultimatefool> Goblins paid off
[4:47:56] <+soullesskin> COOOL JOKER...
[4:48:00] <Highwang> oh I figured. I was just curious if this was pure JRPG or did they add actual stealth to this
[4:48:02] <%WhereIsWill> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[4:48:04] <Thalchampz> goblins win
[4:48:08] <zenorot> does perfect stealth give you anything like items or something
[4:48:20] <+MrBaldachin> 😳
[4:48:30] <%RubberFistFight> @zenorot causes the security level to go down
[4:48:32] <%hawk_rush> @Daniel_Is_I it's less that, and more that his sp usage isn't distributed between his team
[4:48:37] <mastertwin2> At a certain point I have to believe that Morgana's ONE LINE when you hit a weak spot has to be intentionally just one line
[4:48:50] <BeefyQueefer> !uptime
[4:48:50] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 48m.
[4:49:15] <%logoth_> This one's weak to cringe posts
[4:49:20] <Highwang> was Baton Pass a mechanic in the past game? I don't recognize it
[4:49:24] <+midgarmerc> This one's weak to cursing. That asshole.
[4:49:26] <zenorot> yes
[4:49:35] <%RubberFistFight> @Highwang in P5 vanilla, yes.
[4:49:35] <$Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt what's your favorite element like, in persona and FF games?
[4:49:36] <%Ultimatefool> In P5 original, yeah
[4:49:36] <%FatherGreyBeard> yes, but you had to do their confidants first
[4:49:38] <%bigmacjack12> @highwang yes
[4:49:44] <+soullesskin> Hit with curse real hard
[4:49:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYE
[4:49:45] <+MrBaldachin> I think the repetitious audio helps with autopiloting in these types of games
[4:49:48] <Highwang> ah, so it was in 5 but not 4 backwards
[4:49:49] <%Nobrev> DEAD
[4:49:49] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Is their xp even still?

[4:51:00] <goats_iii> He said, on his deathbed
[4:51:08] <%hawk_rush> I gave up on making the exp super equal, i'm just happy that they all level up at the same time
[4:51:09] <Damie904> "You're so gorgeous Panther" Fuck you Mona
[4:51:18] <%logoth_> Mona cant help but simp even during battle
[4:51:20] <TioXyco> @Synti_Sin Oh. thought it was something new from Royal
[4:51:23] <%Japanfreak2595> Ironically it’s Joker without the 666 exp
[4:51:26] <Highwang> I dig the cat. both of them
[4:51:27] <+soullesskin> Only death!!!
[4:51:29] <%bigmacjack12> I want to bully this cat so much

[4:52:27] <%s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt just call them stands
[4:52:29] <%bigmacjack12> I cant wait until we get the character then completely replaces the cat as battle narrator
[4:52:32] <Damie904> Didn't Royal change it so you could shake down for money and then still do all out?
[4:52:32] <+soullesskin> Personeros!
[4:52:33] <Highwang> ALART 99.99
[4:52:37] <%RubberFistFight> @ape_hawk is that a fucking The Stand reference?
[4:52:47] <$Dakuu75> Did Pat ever play Nioh?
[4:52:51] <%Dr00_PhD> @Damie904 that was in the original
[4:52:54] <%AzureGale> Sine wave barriers!
[4:53:20] <zenorot> So until Makato then
[4:53:20] <+StrifeZubia> Yeah technicals are NUTS now
[4:53:25] <%templar010> BLOODLINE TECHNIQUE
[4:53:31] <Monkeyweed21> I think that
[4:53:31] <%hawk_rush> can you actually do that???
[4:53:33] <+rei0> yep
[4:53:34] <%GabeSweetMan> Not royal, it's an ability later from Sun.
[4:53:40] <%Dr00_PhD> You need yoshida to do it
[4:53:42] <%starotter70> Pretty sure that was in the original
[4:53:42] <Monkeyweed21> I think its a sun confidant thing
[4:53:43] <heartlesshealer> "what a strange costume"
[4:53:45] <Damie904> Ah
[4:53:53] <%hawk_rush> ah gotcha
[4:53:53] <%GabeSweetMan> Best boy Sun gets you RICH.
[4:53:55] <Damie904> Jesus
[4:53:56] <%Spec7re> Jesus
[4:54:10] <chidere> I wishI liked the combat in Persona more
[4:54:10] <%giandeli> It’s amazing
[4:54:11] <+Arsimckhoi> which level is this? art teacher guy?
[4:54:17] <Damie904> yea art
[4:54:21] <%Japanfreak2595> Use diplomacy to get rich
[4:54:22] <%GabeSweetMan> I do NOT however know if there have been any changes to Sun's abilities.
[4:54:25] <AutechreTwinAphex> is there really enough new in this to justify another $60 instead of just being a $20 DLC?
[4:54:31] <quietshun> it's so easy to get money in mementos
[4:54:38] <%floralkami> i really hope there is some way to switch Takeover with Last Surprise for the ambush music
[4:54:42] <%extradopeness> Boy ain’t right
[4:54:44] <%maenos2> psaBlind
[4:54:49] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami nope.
[4:54:58] <Monkeyweed21> is that just snatch?
[4:55:06] <%hawk_rush> psaBlind
[4:55:09] <%WETBUTTDISEASE> psaSmug
[4:55:09] <zenorot> This probably should had been an expansion rather a full price game
[4:55:16] <+StrifeZubia> I haven't been paying attention, how's our boy been doing on Will Seeds?
[4:55:17] <%ape_hawk> "hey boss, how much dumb bullshit should we put in your museu--" "ALL OF IT!!"
[4:55:29] <%thegreatbambe> Dark Side Pat FeelsWeirdMan
[4:55:43] <AutechreTwinAphex> yeah I remember how much shit Nioh 2 got for being '1.5' - but at least that is an entirely new game, new levels, new combat system, etc - yet this gets a free pass for being essentially a DLC
[4:55:44] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami if you have the free DLC, you can replace the encounter music and end battle screen music with some from previous games, but you can't switch takeover for last surprise.
[4:55:45] <%Dr00_PhD> I think he's about to get number 1
[4:55:46] <%starotter70> @PatStaresAt The reason your current gun is good is that you can potentially down an enemy with it, since it stuns then tech's them
[4:55:51] <%floralkami> @rubberfistfight uuuuuugh, it would feel so much better imo, thoooo. and i like LS better
[4:55:52] <%GabeSweetMan> I don't mind it being a new release vs DLC, how it comes packaged doesn't matter to me.... I just wish having P5 clear data just automatically gave you NG+ for Royal.
[4:56:04] <piratekingboros> HI PAT. Took a break from FFXII to come say hi. Wassup? What level are your units?? Luv ya!
[4:56:18] <%GabeSweetMan> LMAO
[4:56:18] <artoflec> @AutechreTwinAphex it was mostly souls babies that do that comparison, they're so incredibly overdefensive about dark souls
[4:56:23] <%hawk_rush> this is in a weird place, there's enough content and QoL changes that makes it worth more than an expansion, but still less than a new game
[4:56:23] <%giandeli> @gabesweetman same
[4:56:23] <%logoth_> DANGAR
[4:56:29] <%MisterRockett> Yeah you gotta drag Yosuke in here.
[4:56:39] <+ahdurian> big blind
[4:56:41] <AutechreTwinAphex> @artoflec yeah for me Nioh 2 and FF7R are by far the best games released so far this year
[4:57:07] <%GabeSweetMan> Good job Skull. Shotgun is best waifu.
[4:57:27] <TioXyco> don't forget to look for will seeds, will you?
[4:57:33] <Monkeyweed21> AWW YEAH THIS DUDE
[4:57:40] <+democrazyyy> tomatoKnife tomatoThief
[4:57:45] <+senro1> love this personars
[4:57:47] <@SoFarFetched> His goblins won't let him forget.
[4:57:51] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt the will seeds are a bit later in this one.
[4:57:51] <%Totally_not_toby> fuck you shiki-ouji
[4:57:56] <%starotter70> Will seeds aren't that hard to find
[4:57:59] <%Totally_not_toby> hate this dude
[4:58:04] <ScreamLord> Weird that the PAPER man isn't weak to fire
[4:58:09] <zenorot> I hate this guy. The bods battle with him was hard.
[4:58:12] <%GabeSweetMan> FUCK
[4:58:12] <quietshun> more like stupid ouji
[4:58:12] <AutechreTwinAphex> this version totally obsoletes the original right? no downsides?
[4:58:14] <+democrazyyy> I love shiki-ouji, first persona I came across that I wanted desperately
[4:58:15] <%floralkami> it does kinda suck people with the original P5 can't just buy a DLC expansion patch for NG+for all the new content
[4:58:16] <%reonome> F
[4:58:16] <%maenos2> ow
[4:58:17] <%hawk_rush> LUL
[4:58:18] <%Spec7re> WASTED
[4:58:23] <+ahdurian> LUL
[4:58:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> f
[4:58:24] <%AzureGale> "ravish them" ohhoho
[4:58:27] <%j0ustar> !uptime
[4:58:27] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 58m.
[4:58:28] <Zombrocom> Dayum
[4:58:29] <pitabears> what difficulty is this?
[4:58:33] <@SoFarFetched> Normal
[4:58:35] <%AzureGale> rekt
[4:58:36] <%ape_hawk> of course pat chooses the simp to res Ann
[4:58:39] <%floralkami> @autechretwinaphex if you don't already have it, definitely
[4:58:39] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami i think too much of the core mechanics have been changed to make it DLC patchable
[4:58:43] <DefaultSettiings> I have no idea what the fuck is happening. but protecc red butt girl
[4:58:44] <%shaidot> debuffs are much more effective in royal
[4:58:46] <%aslfrasle> EASY MODE IS NOW UNLOCKED
[4:58:48] <%RubberFistFight> easier to just release it as a new game wholecloth
[4:58:56] <%fizuth> @azuregale im almost certain he said "ravage them" but go off
[4:58:56] <+midgarmerc> "Panther's been taken out! Someone treat her!" wow this simp doesn't believe in splitting the bill 50/50
[4:59:03] <Synti_Sin> I like that they made the red shadows unable to be negotiated with until they're low hp, it was way too easy to "beat" them with 1 weakness hit
[4:59:04] <%Fooguwu> it's that titty gel
[4:59:05] <+FrenchTact1cs> Cbd oil
[4:59:11] <AutechreTwinAphex> does Royale now have meaningful graphics upgrades for PS4 Pro instead of just a resolution bump?
[4:59:14] <+ahdurian> i know someone mentioned the Joker/Yusuke battle, but isnt there a solo Ryuji/Joker one too? Pat's xp gonna get f'd
[4:59:18] <Monkeyweed21> Joker is a pimp, morgana is a simp
[4:59:41] <%zeif00> Take the seed Kreygasm
[4:59:43] <%GabeSweetMan> Nom
[4:59:43] <+tnomads> how many more demons does this version add?
[4:59:44] <%hawk_rush> @ahdurian yep
[4:59:47] <DrStinkers> wat this new thing
[4:59:49] <%floralkami> @rubberfistfight i can see why people would just wait until they come out with the eventually definitive edition instead of buying the original, should a P6 come out soon
[4:59:53] <%Japanfreak2595> The extras in the Thieves Den make the original P5 feel empty. And I’m not even a the extra semester.
[4:59:56] <+StrifeZubia> Awh yeah take that old man seed
[5:00:05] <zenorot> what do these do?
[5:00:21] <%FatherGreyBeard> what the hell is a Will Seed
[5:00:21] <+StrifeZubia> They make powerful accessories or something
[5:00:28] <%FatherGreyBeard> oh
[5:00:30] <fenrirmitsuki> I’ll gladly take that old man’s seed >:3c
[5:00:33] <%Alopekis> Fursona!
[5:00:34] <%aslfrasle> If you find all three they make pretty op gear.
[5:00:36] <%ape_hawk> whats the sin equivalent of "letting someone's mom die of a seizure"?
[5:00:37] <%Totally_not_toby> vanity isn't a deadly sin and none of the ones other than vanity and lust seem perscribed correctly AT ALL
[5:00:42] <%ape_hawk> probably sloth
[5:00:43] <AutechreTwinAphex> I can't remember this switching around in OG - is it something new?
[5:00:45] <%necronominick> necronominick subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[5:00:57] <TioXyco> Baton Pass is not new, I think
[5:00:58] <zenorot> Oh. Aren't redundant bc of the Velvet room thing
[5:01:01] <+StrifeZubia> No, Baton Pass was just harder to get in P5 vanilla
[5:01:05] <%ape_hawk> all of it?
[5:01:08] <Monkeyweed21> INFINITY
[5:01:09] <+democrazyyy> you had to level social links for it before but now it's baseline
[5:01:13] <+AFrostyCookie> Baton pass was locked behind rank 2 confidant
[5:01:14] <%maenos2> @autechretwinaphex baton pass? was a central mechanic.
[5:01:15] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami that said, the reason they keep doing it the way they are is they KNOW people will buy the first version and then buy the definitive version as well. They have no incentive to not do it that way. People want their Personas real bad.
[5:01:22] <%aslfrasle> Baton Pass isn't new, though the buffs it gives you are new I believe.
[5:01:25] <%espanishcanamurciana> so this is blathers dream zone of the art museum
[5:01:28] <%floralkami> @totally_not_toby depending on who you ask, wouldn't vanity be similar to pride?
[5:01:29] <AutechreTwinAphex> @maenos2 yeah I only played up until the end of the Kamoshida arc
[5:01:30] <%Nobrev> you had to unlock baton pass in the original but it's there from the start in royal
[5:01:37] <+MrBaldachin> jermaSour
[5:01:40] <%conradical> don't worry about money cause you'll have infinite when you start grinding out mementos
[5:01:40] <%starotter70> no
[5:01:42] <%arancet> @PatStaresAt its fine, it wont kick you
[5:01:42] <%Spec7re> Ass
[5:01:43] <%maenos2> @autechretwinaphex ahh that would do it
[5:01:44] <pmmori> You can hit it after
[5:01:47] <%ape_hawk> i blame ryuji for this
[5:01:47] <%espanishcanamurciana> whats going on up there??
[5:01:48] <%logoth_> Geeeeessee!
[5:01:48] <%AzureGale> Clearly a good amount of money to have is 9,999,999 yen
[5:01:49] <%Spec7re> YOOOOO
[5:01:50] <quietshun> nothing happens anyway
[5:01:50] <pmmori> you see this cut scene
[5:01:50] <%reonome> YOOOOO

[5:02:15] <+StrifeZubia> No kidding eh? Like we have grappling hooks
[5:02:19] <OldManDeckardCain> it's not like joker has a grappling hook LUL
[5:02:23] <+StrifeZubia> And Joker can jump like 20 feet
[5:02:24] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> For real?
[5:02:24] <%KaiserMario> 2

[5:02:39] <%floralkami> @rubberfistfight curse those dinosaurs. i see why they would have to hate people stream the game

[5:02:54] <Monkeyweed21> Dodge those subs
[5:02:58] <%AzureGale> Can't they just stack on top and let the top person go over
[5:03:00] <%Alazull> Whats up Pat?
[5:03:05] <%floralkami> @rubberfistfight *hate to have
[5:03:05] <%ape_hawk> never listen to simps
[5:03:06] <%shaidot> if i remember correctly theres a will seed pat can get
[5:03:16] <%RubberFistFight> it's the whole "cognition" thing though isn't it. For the same reason their fake guns can hurt the shadows, the sign saying "can't open this from here" means they just can't get past it for now.

[5:04:14] <%floralkami> @rubberfistfight just bring Batman in and say his will is stronger than that sign
[5:04:20] <@SoFarFetched> Think Pat meant it's the only one he can get for now.
[5:04:21] <%espanishcanamurciana> Just imagine in 2022 Pat will be infiltrating Nest 3 as Leon in the RE4 Remake PogChamp
[5:04:22] <%conradical> the will seeds always show up in the same order. i think it's red > green > blue? you can see if you missed one going off of that
[5:04:24] <%GabeSweetMan> Your balls are not huge enough.
[5:04:34] <Aydarkzero> not enough stonks
[5:04:35] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami what's the bet Batman's persona would be... also Batman.
[5:04:38] <%GabeSweetMan> GET HUGE
[5:04:46] <%cvp5127> dont get huge pat
[5:04:46] <Monkeyweed21> Play RE6 now

[5:05:10] <heartlesshealer> so much fun
[5:05:11] <%RubberFistFight> @PatStaresAt considering it takes literally 0 time since it happens in the Velvet room, it's FREE PERSONA REAL ESTATE.
[5:05:14] <%Alopekis> Love you, boo
[5:05:16] <%AzureGale> !HAND INJURED!
[5:05:17] <%conradical> you should have kept going til you get Yusuke
[5:05:20] <%conradical> then grind it out
[5:05:39] <ScreamLord> God I love that finger wag!
[5:05:42] <%TimetodiveLTX> i'll grind it out on you @conradical
[5:05:44] <%Guardiansaiyan> hello everyone
[5:05:48] <%Guardiansaiyan> justc hecking in
[5:05:52] <%reinbachthe3rd> @ahdurian I grinded... a bit.
[5:05:53] <@SoFarFetched> He probably would have gotten there today,but messing with the camera settings was lot more fun LUL
[5:05:53] <%Guardiansaiyan> checking
[5:05:53] <%suikudo> Today was so much more fun! but tomorrow it will be but a dream
[5:06:00] <%conradical> don't tempt me with a good time @TimetodiveLTX
[5:06:10] <%Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt Slowbeef is on...if you want to know
[5:06:15] <%weissguard> Yo @Guardiansaiyan Thanks for doing that uptime thing on the CSBcast btw.
[5:06:30] <%Guardiansaiyan> @weissguard no problem!
[5:06:45] <%Guardiansaiyan> I will keep doing the !uptime thing until Woolie FIXES THAT !UPTIME BOT
[5:06:52] <%floralkami> @rubberfistfight fuck, it would totally just be an edgier looking bat person
[5:06:59] <%Guardiansaiyan> thinks I might have to email woolie about that
[5:07:24] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami nah I was imagining it as literally just a carbon copy of Batman, only 75% as tall.
[5:07:45] <%Guardiansaiyan> !uptime
[5:07:45] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 7m.
[5:07:58] <%Guardiansaiyan> I thought pat didn't want to do a long stream today cause he was tired?
[5:08:01] <%Guardiansaiyan> what happened??
[5:08:06] <@SoFarFetched> He took a long break in the middle.

[5:08:12] <%Guardiansaiyan> that works
[5:08:18] <%Guardiansaiyan> hope Elmo helped him

[5:08:52] <%spiritofmojave> break then donations so ye
[5:08:53] <@SoFarFetched> Yes it's at thet end.
[5:08:56] <%Alopekis> Pat should change his stream music to Hip Hop de Chocobo
[5:09:04] <%Guardiansaiyan> yeah
[5:09:09] <%Guardiansaiyan> Hip Hop de Chocobo
[5:09:19] <%wsintai> I want FF16 to be about Chadley and the main theme should be Hip Hop de Chocobo
[5:09:28] <%Nobrev> its just break time until donation reading and then stream over
[5:09:29] <%Guardiansaiyan> thinks PatStaresAt is SPonsored by Hip Hop de Chocobo imGlitch
[5:09:44] <%spiritofmojave> If Nomura is in charge of FF16 oh god
[5:09:58] <%maenos2> psaDab sipsipDab
[5:10:01] <%Guardiansaiyan> hey! At least he doesn't have De FAT evil
[5:10:09] <%Alopekis> If Nomura makes Hip Hop de Chocobo the theme of FF16 then he can do whatever else he wants with the game.
[5:10:18] <%Guardiansaiyan> Kojima = Nuclear war BAD
[5:10:26] <%Guardiansaiyan> David Cage = FAT EVIL
[5:10:31] <%wsintai> At that point he will have ascended to Super Nomura God Nomura
[5:10:38] <%Guardiansaiyan> Nomura = Time Shenanigans + ZIPPERS
[5:10:48] <%Alopekis> And chain wallets
[5:10:48] <YakumoYomi> @Alopekis I was against Nomura, but you make a compelling argument.
[5:10:52] <gekizenbu> Nomura should make 5 different series into Verum Rex

[5:20:28] <YakumoYomi> You put up with shit when you're in love, apparently. I wouldn't know.

[5:21:26] <%wsintai> Oh yeah that movie

[5:21:41] <%Valdorick> I mean, I can't stop you, its only a reminder.
[5:21:41] <%Alopekis> That sounds like something that should lead to prison time.
[5:21:42] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That movie was fuckingnuts

[5:22:12] <DashXero> 40 lions mbut you only need to get killed by one.
[5:22:13] <%AzureGale> lol
[5:22:15] <%thebeargoesHONK> thebeargoesHONK subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Hey Pat. Random question, how much time are you willing invest into replaying a game/series to get the branching path result you want?
[5:22:17] <heartlesshealer> Don't fuck around with undomesticated animals dammit
[5:22:23] <%suikudo> Might be easier to film em if their blazed tho idunno
[5:22:26] <%Alopekis> Pat, that's been changed
[5:22:29] <%Run44forrest> @theasianavenger96 elmo smells really bad. especially when he had an infection in his mouth
[5:22:30] <%Pyroclase> so many colleges are handling the crisis in the worst possible way
[5:22:40] <%Alopekis> @PatStaresAt It hasn't been AlopekisPup in almost a year
[5:22:44] <%spiritofmojave> Online instruction is ass at a lot of places seems :/
[5:22:47] <%j0ustar> one lion is one lion too many people
[5:22:48] <%GabeSweetMan> Every college is getting sued.
[5:22:55] <%Alopekis> No
[5:23:03] <%supercasualboom> Cheer500 Evening Pastrami, Peach Crisp, and Elmo a la Mold. My wrist was still bothering me, went to the doctor and they I had two choices: 1 month of therapy or steroid shot my wrist for instant heal. Sadly, no one has the stuff so I have to endure the month. At least no surgery. While you playing the Remake and Royale, I been revamping my personal project I told about way back. I think I finally have a formula I can get behind because I would delete my stuff when I’m not happy with it. Laters!
[5:23:04] <Monkeyweed21> AngriestPat would have remembered that
[5:23:06] <%KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Paige, my niece was asking about you, "where is tha pretty lady?" she ask...

[5:23:44] <%Madbearv> You're famous?
[5:23:51] <%Alopekis> Also, I spelled your name wrong on purpose as a funny. It was Bovine. Like cows.

[5:24:26] <agloves> Wow Wrong Opinions Time
[5:24:27] <%GabeSweetMan> @optimasmaximas Tons of campuses shutting down but KEEPING the upkeep money for students who are now not going to be using the dorms and such.
[5:24:29] <%spiritofmojave> You must mean Kanji
[5:24:33] <+Klonoa__> I had the opposite feelings for ryuji and removed him from my party over it lel
[5:24:35] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Morgana vs Teddy for team mascot
[5:24:38] <Monkeyweed21> Naoto is great but belongs with Kanji
[5:24:42] <%RubberFistFight> His behaviour is given a pretty solid explanation later on at least. Like, he's still been a jackass, but you understand WHY, and as far as reasons go, it's pretty good.
[5:24:45] <%Dragovus> Remember Mona's a cat as he screams that he's not a cat
[5:24:46] <DashXero> Simp is below cuck.
[5:24:46] <%Daniel_Is_I> @spiritofmojave Kanji is best manly man

[5:28:38] <%Mitalis> Mitalis subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! After you complete the FF7 Remake, are you going to go back and complete the old FF7 game you were previously playing through on the switch?

[5:29:04] <%Alopekis> I didn't have a memory card for my PS1 so I had to try to get as far as I could in FF7 without dying and hope that I didn't lose power.

[5:29:13] <%tiaramaki> And the end of that Riovanes sequence is super hecky too
